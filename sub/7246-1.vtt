04:09.622 --> 04:11.419
I want him.

04:29.976 --> 04:31.443
Bella, talk to me.

04:31.544 --> 04:33.341
New 30-second spot's ready to roll.

04:33.446 --> 04:34.708
Great.

04:34.814 --> 04:37.612
Cut a few images in of this new guy.
That mug's priceless.

04:37.717 --> 04:40.652
- Eddie, how you trackin'?
- We're hot.

04:40.753 --> 04:42.380
- How hot?
- White hot.

04:42.489 --> 04:44.684
I got "A" team blitzing
chat rooms and blogs.

04:44.791 --> 04:47.282
"B" team's buying ads
and placing the spots.

04:47.393 --> 04:49.725
Site's getting 700 hits per minute.

04:49.829 --> 04:54.493
- Awareness on porn and fight blogs: 92%.
- Bella's got a new 30.

04:54.601 --> 04:57.297
I want you to run that across every sex,
fight and gamer site now.

04:57.403 --> 04:58.700
Hit the gamers hard.

04:58.805 --> 05:00.329
- Got it.
- Push it, people. Push it.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.170
Somewhere, someone on this planet
does not know about this show.

05:03.276 --> 05:05.369
Asia, Africa, Antarctica.

05:05.478 --> 05:07.605
There's a fucking
Eskimo sitting in his little igloo...

05:07.714 --> 05:10.547
who does not know
that we go live in 22 hours.

05:10.650 --> 05:14.347
Find him. Get him. Eddie.

05:14.454 --> 05:17.082
Ninety-two?
I want a hundred.

05:17.190 --> 05:18.782
100% awareness across this Internet.

05:18.892 --> 05:20.189
- You got it?
- You got it.

05:24.697 --> 05:26.892
Did you leave...
No more oranges today.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.401
That's it for the oranges, okay?
Throw it away.

05:30.503 --> 05:32.368
Is that solo ready?

05:32.472 --> 05:34.372
Is it ready?
You know where to put it.

05:37.944 --> 05:39.411
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

05:39.512 --> 05:41.946
Just so you know, we're fucked.

05:42.982 --> 05:44.609
Oh, yeah. We are screwed.

05:44.717 --> 05:46.582
This show ain't happenin'.

05:47.353 --> 05:49.617
Goldman, come on.
Talk to me.

05:50.390 --> 05:51.857
Where are we at?

05:52.625 --> 05:54.092
Where are we at?

05:55.461 --> 05:57.520
I've got 87 cluster-cams
ready and rigged.

05:57.630 --> 06:00.121
I got 147 solos
with all built-in mikes, okay?

06:00.233 --> 06:03.168
I got 60 to 70 all ready
to go out in the field.

06:03.269 --> 06:05.464
- So altogether there's 400 lenses, right?
- Great.

06:05.572 --> 06:09.474
But there are dead spots
all over this island.

06:09.576 --> 06:12.067
I do not have enough time.
This show is not going off.

06:12.178 --> 06:14.305
We are at war, Goldy.

06:14.414 --> 06:16.314
Gotta improvise, overcome, adapt.

06:16.416 --> 06:19.579
This is not war, Breck.
This is television.

06:19.686 --> 06:22.086
It's much more complicated.
I do not have enough hardware...

06:22.188 --> 06:24.383
and if you haven't noticed,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

06:26.859 --> 06:30.158
Mango, do not touch.
What did I say before?

06:30.263 --> 06:33.061
I told you an hour and a half ago.
Do not touch. Thank you.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.135
And on top... Where are you going with that?
Can I have that? Thank you.

06:36.235 --> 06:38.829
Here's the really cool thing.
I got these all-stars.

06:38.938 --> 06:41.338
It's really great,
because between the lot of them...

06:41.441 --> 06:43.341
they all speak three words of English.

06:43.443 --> 06:45.035
So I'm supposed to
run an operation...

06:45.144 --> 06:47.840
that is basically bigger than Farm Aid
meets We Are the World...

06:47.947 --> 06:49.881
and I'm supposed to do it
in sign language?

06:49.983 --> 06:52.474
Are you out of your mind?
Do I look like Quincy Jones?

06:52.585 --> 06:54.519
- Breck.
- You know, it's all gonna work out.

06:54.621 --> 06:56.088
- You know why?
- Why?

06:56.189 --> 06:57.918
'Cause you're the best.

06:59.759 --> 07:01.784
- For the love of Christ.
- Hey, babe.

07:01.894 --> 07:03.361
Donna Sereno just arrived.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.257
Good. She know the score?

07:06.366 --> 07:09.767
Tomorrow morning.
You're her top story.

07:09.869 --> 07:11.837
But be ready.

07:11.938 --> 07:13.963
She's a tough nut.

07:14.073 --> 07:15.631
She's the big dog.

07:16.676 --> 07:19.645
Want the big press,
gotta go to the big dog.

07:19.746 --> 07:22.715
Right. Do it like that.

07:23.816 --> 07:25.716
All right. How do I look?

07:26.486 --> 07:27.953
I'd do ya.

07:28.054 --> 07:29.749
Yeah, but how do I look?

07:31.290 --> 07:32.757
Go get 'em.

07:35.895 --> 07:37.453
Lettuce? Do you want
tomato or anything?

07:37.563 --> 07:39.394
Give me that freakin' sandwich.

07:39.499 --> 07:41.797
Go to work on my satellite.

07:41.968 --> 07:46.132
So, without a major network behind you,
how do you plan to broadcast your show?

07:46.239 --> 07:47.729
The Internet.

07:47.840 --> 07:53.745
I've pulled 10 contestants
from third world prisons.

07:53.846 --> 07:57.247
Each was on death row.
I will free one of them.

07:57.350 --> 08:00.012
See, tomorrow, I'm gonna
bring them here to this island...

08:00.119 --> 08:03.646
where I will give them
a fighting chance at a new life.

08:03.756 --> 08:05.417
It's a fight to the death.

08:06.893 --> 08:08.360
One lives, nine die?

08:11.698 --> 08:13.825
You're airing a live snuff film.

08:14.567 --> 08:15.693
No, Donna.

08:15.802 --> 08:18.999
These contestants were
already dead... condemned.

08:19.105 --> 08:22.506
I'm allowing one to live.
Is that so wrong?

08:22.608 --> 08:24.371
It's immoral and illegal.

08:25.478 --> 08:30.108
You're a multimillionaire who may become
a billionaire producing murder.

08:42.328 --> 08:43.919
I'm done with Hollywood.

08:44.030 --> 08:47.158
I'm going direct to my audience,
worldwide and live.

08:47.266 --> 08:51.965
And my numbers will demolish any show
on any network this year.

08:52.705 --> 08:54.138
Mark my words.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.071
Breck, we have a problem.

08:56.175 --> 08:59.110
I like to think of it
more as a challenge.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.471
We just lost one of our headliners.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.376
What do you mean "lost"?

09:07.487 --> 09:08.954
- They shot my Arab?
- Uh-huh.

09:09.055 --> 09:11.421
We had him on the mainland,
and they shot my fuckin' Arab?

09:11.524 --> 09:13.958
Relax. Relax. Okay.
We got a replacement.

09:14.060 --> 09:16.551
- How'd the interview go?
- Smooth as butter.

09:16.662 --> 09:19.426
Replacement? Who? What? Where?
What have we got?

09:19.532 --> 09:21.090
JosÃ© Havanando.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.225
Hard-core Guatemalan.

09:23.336 --> 09:26.772
Convicted of 13 torture killings.
He's ready to go.

09:26.873 --> 09:29.103
I don't want a fucking Guatemalan.

09:29.876 --> 09:31.810
I already got two Mexicans.

09:31.911 --> 09:34.436
Look. You see here?

09:34.547 --> 09:36.674
This is the Arab world.

09:36.783 --> 09:39.809
If they don't have anybody to cheer for,
they don't log on.

09:39.919 --> 09:41.784
I want a fucking Arab!

09:41.888 --> 09:45.688
Child-killing, Koran-ranting,
suicide-bombing Arab.

09:45.792 --> 09:48.886
Okay, okay. We're on.
Our scout in Central America...

09:48.995 --> 09:51.657
has got a line
on a 6'7" Islamic fundamentalist.

09:51.764 --> 09:55.097
He's in a joint in El Salvador.
Warden's good to go.

09:55.201 --> 09:58.261
- He's ours if we want him.
- Get him online.

09:58.371 --> 10:00.430
Crew's en route to the prison now.

10:31.671 --> 10:32.968
Hashim.

11:29.295 --> 11:32.492
Gringo, the warden wants you now.

11:32.598 --> 11:34.566
Tell the warden to go fuck himself.

12:10.803 --> 12:12.498
What's this all about?

12:13.339 --> 12:14.772
Bullshit.

12:58.117 --> 12:59.709
Can I go now?

13:10.496 --> 13:13.465
Who the hell is this guy?
What have you got, Eddie?

13:13.566 --> 13:14.533
American.

13:14.633 --> 13:19.229
Arrested one year ago
in San Miguel, El Salvador.

13:19.338 --> 13:20.862
Killed three men.

13:20.973 --> 13:23.407
Awaiting death sentence.

13:23.509 --> 13:25.374
Thank you, God.

13:25.478 --> 13:27.912
I thought you wanted an Arab.

13:28.014 --> 13:31.848
Forget the Arab.
I got this guy. He's perfect.

13:31.951 --> 13:35.318
With anti-Americanism
rampant all over the globe...

13:35.421 --> 13:37.912
people are gonna love
to hate this cowboy.

13:39.225 --> 13:41.250
Clean him up.
Let's bring him down.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.987
Get him on a plane.

14:05.251 --> 14:08.914
Come here. Give me the key.
I'll do you a deal. Hey, come back.

14:09.021 --> 14:12.957
<i>Americano, huh?
Big boy.</i>

14:13.059 --> 14:15.254
<i>Gonna cut you like
sazizza, capito?</i>

14:17.363 --> 14:19.524
So where they pull you from?

14:21.267 --> 14:23.292
Put a muzzle in it, boy.

14:23.402 --> 14:25.893
- You're already boring me.
- Who you callin' "boy"?

14:26.639 --> 14:29.073
"Ewan McStarley.
London, England.

14:29.175 --> 14:31.075
Four years, Special Forces.

14:31.177 --> 14:33.702
Three peacekeeping tours
through Africa.

14:33.813 --> 14:36.145
Set fire to a village in Rwanda.

14:36.248 --> 14:40.912
Executed 17 men, raped nine women."
Torture. Mutilation. Good stuff.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.817
You ladies should
get along real good.

14:42.922 --> 14:44.913
What in the fuck is wrong with you?

14:45.024 --> 14:47.254
All in a day's work, Rasta.

15:08.848 --> 15:10.315
Get this top off her.

15:10.416 --> 15:13.408
We're in show business,
not a soup kitchen.

15:14.453 --> 15:16.478
Where's my new guy?
The American.

15:16.589 --> 15:18.056
Right over there.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.792
Hey. I'm Ian Breckel.

15:31.537 --> 15:33.869
- I produce television.
- Well, good for you.

15:33.973 --> 15:35.463
Maybe you heard of me.

15:35.574 --> 15:38.008
Bud, I ain't been watchin'
too much TV lately.

15:38.110 --> 15:39.577
Why don't you have a seat?

15:43.983 --> 15:46.543
You and the others
will be taken to an island...

15:46.652 --> 15:48.677
where you'll fight against each other.

15:48.787 --> 15:52.723
If you're the last one
left alive after 30 hours...

15:52.825 --> 15:56.317
I will set you free
with a pocket full of cash.

15:57.429 --> 16:00.523
- How's that sound?
- What's this got to do with TV?

16:00.633 --> 16:02.931
Not TV.
The Internet.

16:04.103 --> 16:07.334
I'll be streaming the entire event
live across the World Wide Web.

16:07.439 --> 16:09.498
Your rap sheet's a little thin.

16:10.442 --> 16:12.774
"Jack Conrad, American.

16:12.878 --> 16:15.711
Blew up a building in El Salvador,
killing three men."

16:15.814 --> 16:19.341
- What were you doing in El Salvador?
- Workin' on my tan.

16:19.451 --> 16:22.249
- Why'd you blow the building up?
- It was blockin' my sun.

16:24.890 --> 16:28.018
- What do you do for a living, Jack?
- I'm an interior decorator.

16:30.696 --> 16:32.721
Okay. I see.

16:32.831 --> 16:35.197
Well, where are you from
back in the States then, huh?

16:35.301 --> 16:38.168
- Alaska.
- Alaska. Whereabouts?

16:38.270 --> 16:40.238
About 80 miles north of Anchorage.

16:40.339 --> 16:42.239
Little fishing town.
You probably heard of it.

16:42.341 --> 16:44.104
It's called Fuck Your Mama.

16:48.047 --> 16:50.242
Babe, do me a favor.

16:50.349 --> 16:54.547
Why don't you write a bio for this redneck.
Let's say he's from Arkansas.

16:54.653 --> 16:57.281
An arsonist, a racist,
a KKK Klansman.

16:57.389 --> 17:00.620
Blew up a Baptist church.
Fugitive from the FBI.

17:00.726 --> 17:02.387
Ended up in Central America...

17:02.494 --> 17:06.396
where he blew up a clinic for retards
and handicapped people, killing dozens.

17:06.498 --> 17:10.093
Women, children, blah, blah.
Do it right now. Get it to Bella.

17:12.003 --> 17:15.701
I don't know who you are,
and I don't care.

17:16.976 --> 17:18.443
But I don't play games.

17:18.544 --> 17:20.569
You don't have to win...

17:20.679 --> 17:22.510
but everybody plays.

17:25.317 --> 17:26.443
Come on.

17:43.002 --> 17:45.664
Hey, boss.
How about something to eat?

17:47.339 --> 17:51.139
Oh, yeah. Husband and wife.
Lovers.

17:51.877 --> 17:55.313
You know, you can stick together,
fight as a team...

17:55.414 --> 17:59.908
but the fact of the matter is, only one
of you will get off the island alive.

18:05.858 --> 18:07.450
Easy. Easy.

18:09.295 --> 18:10.262
Easy.

18:10.362 --> 18:13.331
Hope you can run your feet
as fast as you run your mouth.

18:14.967 --> 18:16.764
Easy, Rosa.

18:16.869 --> 18:18.336
Let's get out of here.

18:20.205 --> 18:22.105
Okay. Listen up, gang.

18:22.207 --> 18:25.472
On your ankle you all have a rig...

18:25.577 --> 18:28.205
packed with 20 ounces
of plastic explosive.

18:29.148 --> 18:30.809
Twenty ounces.

18:30.916 --> 18:34.784
That's enough
to incinerate you, your dog...

18:34.887 --> 18:38.118
and the small house you may be
residing in at the time.

18:38.223 --> 18:41.317
In exactly 30 hours from now...

18:41.427 --> 18:45.158
that plastic explosive
will do what it does best.

18:46.732 --> 18:49.030
You want that rig
removed from your ankle...

18:49.134 --> 18:52.399
simply be the sole survivor
in 30 hours from now.

18:53.939 --> 18:56.134
There are two other ways
to detonate an ankle rig.

18:56.241 --> 18:59.267
One:
You see that red pull tab?

19:01.513 --> 19:04.346
Yank on that,
and after a 10-second delay...

19:05.084 --> 19:06.676
boom.

19:06.785 --> 19:07.752
Two:

19:08.687 --> 19:12.521
Tamper with the rig, you mess with
the wires, you try and pick the lock...

19:12.624 --> 19:15.115
instantly, without delay...

19:16.795 --> 19:18.126
boom.

19:20.332 --> 19:22.027
It's a very simple game.

19:23.535 --> 19:25.628
Kill...

19:25.738 --> 19:27.205
or die.

20:47.486 --> 20:50.978
Choppers are coming.
Cons are on the way. We ready? Goldy?

20:51.089 --> 20:52.613
What, are you kidding me?
Absolutely not.

20:52.724 --> 20:55.124
- Bella?
- Yeah. I was born ready.

20:55.227 --> 20:56.694
- Eddie?
- Good to go.

20:56.795 --> 20:59.127
Bella, give me some
old-school rock and roll.

21:00.732 --> 21:03.064
Goldy, our satellite gonna hold up?

21:03.168 --> 21:04.192
Hey, no.

21:05.404 --> 21:06.962
Bella, cue the music.

21:12.244 --> 21:13.211
Eddie.

21:15.047 --> 21:16.514
Take us live to the Web.

21:35.901 --> 21:37.368
And each of you- dead.

22:10.702 --> 22:11.669
Bite this.

22:20.779 --> 22:24.738
Hey, gringo!
I'll look after your wife!

22:37.663 --> 22:40.359
Okay. Give me 182-B.

22:44.236 --> 22:46.033
That's genius, Goldy.

22:46.872 --> 22:48.840
I tell you, man.
You're the best.

22:48.941 --> 22:50.465
Say that again.

22:57.349 --> 22:59.249
I'll be waiting for
your ass in the bush!

22:59.351 --> 23:01.410
<i>It's going to be a festa!</i>

23:01.520 --> 23:03.249
Breakfast, lunch and dinner!

23:03.355 --> 23:04.788
Okay. You're up. Let's go.

23:06.858 --> 23:08.917
Open up! Open your mouth!

23:10.662 --> 23:13.597
I said open your mouth!
Put that in your mouth!

23:15.100 --> 23:16.727
Get out of here.

23:23.075 --> 23:24.804
- Oops.
- Oops?

23:24.910 --> 23:26.673
That's no "oops."
That's a fuckup times 10.

23:26.778 --> 23:28.245
Give me this.

23:28.347 --> 23:31.009
Hey, idiots. Watch where
you're tossing these guys.

23:31.116 --> 23:32.981
I got a fucking show to put on.

23:36.021 --> 23:37.750
Open up.

23:50.936 --> 23:52.801
Open your mouth.

23:53.905 --> 23:55.964
Come on.
Open your fuckin' mouth.

23:57.542 --> 24:00.943
- Goddamn it!
- He never saw that coming.

24:02.714 --> 24:04.477
You dumb son of a bitch!

25:25.897 --> 25:27.364
Eddie, talk to me.

25:27.466 --> 25:30.697
We got 'em all in a nice little cluster
on the south end of the island.

25:30.802 --> 25:33.032
- Good.
- It's only a matter of time.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.454
- Breck.
- Action. We got action.

26:23.555 --> 26:24.920
Get me in there.

26:32.564 --> 26:34.998
Bella, give me some music.
All right. What have we got?

26:35.100 --> 26:38.297
We're on 23, 24, 31... all good angles.
We're on 23 now.

27:03.495 --> 27:06.123
This is hard-fucking-core, man!

27:39.130 --> 27:40.893
That's gotta hurt.

27:57.215 --> 27:59.308
She's pulled it.
She's pulled it.

28:05.657 --> 28:07.181
Sweet!

28:11.463 --> 28:14.990
- That's what I'm talking about, people.
- Nice. Very nice.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.529
Go to 112.

28:17.636 --> 28:21.299
Right! Oh, bam! Five million!

28:21.406 --> 28:23.533
- Listen up. People. Breck.
- What?

28:23.642 --> 28:26.338
Five million users
have just logged on to the site.

28:26.444 --> 28:27.911
Okay. Well, that's a start.

28:29.014 --> 28:30.641
That's a start?

28:31.917 --> 28:33.578
Well, what are you after?

28:33.685 --> 28:35.744
You know how many households
watch the Super Bowl?

28:35.854 --> 28:38.789
- Yeah, like 40 million.
- Right. That's what I'm after.

28:38.890 --> 28:41.222
- Well, that's impossible.
- Yeah, really?

28:41.326 --> 28:43.385
You wait till the blogs and chat rooms...

28:43.495 --> 28:47.090
start hyping the fact that this
right-wing dirtbag just got wasted live...

28:47.198 --> 28:49.996
by a hot African chick
with a nice rack.

28:50.735 --> 28:54.068
Trust me, Goldy.
The Internet... it's wildfire.

28:54.172 --> 28:55.139
Good work.

29:17.329 --> 29:19.797
You trackin' me?
Are you following me?

29:19.898 --> 29:21.126
<i>No, ese.</i>

29:21.232 --> 29:24.201
Partner, you can move on
or things are gonna get a little rough.

29:29.941 --> 29:31.408
<i>Easy, ese.</i>

29:33.278 --> 29:34.939
I'm looking for my wife.

29:35.981 --> 29:37.448
That's all I want.

29:39.684 --> 29:41.151
My Rosa.

30:03.274 --> 30:06.209
Gringo, try this.

30:34.873 --> 30:36.966
This shit is fucked up.

31:32.697 --> 31:34.164
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.934
- What's your coverage here?
- Cluster-cam set.

31:45.043 --> 31:48.240
Got three additional cameras
in this location.

31:48.346 --> 31:51.247
Let's spice it up then, huh?
Slice and dice.

31:52.083 --> 31:55.678
Yeah. I'm slicing and dicing.
Do I tell you how to do your job?

31:56.688 --> 31:57.655
Thanks.

32:00.024 --> 32:01.491
Calm down, homey.

32:11.769 --> 32:12.895
Get down.

32:19.344 --> 32:21.608
- Nice.
- I love this Japanese dude.

32:21.713 --> 32:24.011
Come on. Who's your money on?
Who do you like?

32:24.115 --> 32:27.482
Guys, could you please go back to your space,
'cause this is kind of like my space.

32:28.820 --> 32:30.412
Come on, nigga.

32:48.573 --> 32:49.665
Motherfucker!

33:11.196 --> 33:13.027
Lovely day, don't you think?

33:19.103 --> 33:20.570
No, you settle down, son.

33:27.212 --> 33:29.407
Bit lively this morning,
ain't we, tiger?

33:31.616 --> 33:33.379
I saw you fight the spade.

33:33.484 --> 33:35.475
Pretty ballsy for
a little geezer, isn't ya?

33:37.655 --> 33:39.680
The way I see it...

33:39.791 --> 33:42.954
you and me clear some of this scum up
on the island.

33:43.061 --> 33:44.756
Together. A team.

33:44.862 --> 33:47.763
Alliance. You and me.
You understand?

33:53.805 --> 33:55.238
You want these?

33:58.943 --> 34:00.501
They look better on you.

34:36.047 --> 34:39.072
Hold on right there, big man.
Slow down.

34:40.585 --> 34:42.313
Just slow down.

34:45.556 --> 34:48.684
If you stay down,
we don't have a problem.

34:54.632 --> 34:56.099
We have a big fuckin' problem.

35:02.407 --> 35:04.841
Hey, Breck.
Something's going down.

35:04.942 --> 35:07.604
I got two cons right on top
of each other.

35:07.712 --> 35:10.112
It's Conrad and the big dude.

35:10.214 --> 35:11.681
Goldy, what are you, blind?

35:11.783 --> 35:13.910
- What?
- Get this screen up on the live feed.

35:14.018 --> 35:15.849
- Okay. I got it right here.
- Music, Bella. Music.

35:15.953 --> 35:17.978
Now, Bella.

35:41.913 --> 35:44.677
Okay. We're on 202 now.
Zoom in.

36:19.984 --> 36:21.747
208 and 205.

36:39.804 --> 36:41.431
Hold on a minute!

36:58.389 --> 37:00.357
- Hey, Breck.
- Yeah.

37:00.458 --> 37:01.652
Twelve million.

37:02.527 --> 37:07.157
We just hit 12 million subscribers
online right now.

37:07.899 --> 37:10.231
Hey. You hear that, Goldy?
Twelve million.

37:11.235 --> 37:12.998
Yeah. Well, 12 million
still isn't 40 million.

37:13.104 --> 37:15.436
- Still ain't no Super Bowl.
- Not yet.

37:15.540 --> 37:19.738
Bella, Eddie, replay that fall in super slo-mo
until we get something better.

37:23.514 --> 37:25.778
Ian Breckel. Where is he?
What do we know?

37:25.883 --> 37:28.909
He could be streaming the data
to a server from almost anywhere.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.783
I've contacted Interpol.

37:30.888 --> 37:33.914
They're collecting information
from agencies all over the world.

37:34.025 --> 37:36.516
The island is somewhere
in the South Pacific.

37:36.627 --> 37:39.255
I got World War II historians
and regional experts...

37:39.363 --> 37:41.456
examining the images from the Web site.

37:41.566 --> 37:46.060
Between Indonesia and New Guinea
there are, like, 2,000 tiny islands.

37:47.104 --> 37:48.628
Needle in a haystack.

37:48.739 --> 37:52.140
Ten prisoners in this thing.
Two of them are American.

37:52.243 --> 37:54.939
One is Kreston Mackie.
African-American.

37:55.046 --> 37:57.276
He escaped incarceration... 2002.

37:57.381 --> 38:00.441
Ironically, two years later,
ends up on death row in Malaysia.

38:00.551 --> 38:02.883
- What about the other guy?
- I can't find a thing.

38:02.987 --> 38:04.454
It's like he doesn't exist.

38:06.390 --> 38:09.223
I just got a tip on the hotline
about the American, Jack Conrad.

38:09.327 --> 38:10.294
Shoot.

38:10.394 --> 38:13.659
The guy who recognized him on the Internet
says they went to high school together...

38:13.764 --> 38:15.732
only he says
his real name's Jack Riley.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.926
<i>US Army, retired.</i>

38:18.035 --> 38:20.560
<i>Until a year ago, he was living in Texas.</i>

38:20.671 --> 38:22.138
<i>Then he disappeared.</i>

38:22.240 --> 38:23.605
<i>Vanished.</i>

38:23.708 --> 38:26.677
<i>Family, friends...
no one's heard from him since.</i>

38:26.777 --> 38:28.972
<i>He had a girlfriend
named Sarah Cavanaugh.</i>

38:29.080 --> 38:32.015
<i>Divorced, two kids,
works as a waitress.</i>

38:32.116 --> 38:33.583
Gimme the ball!

38:37.722 --> 38:39.883
- Got ya.
- Let go of me!

38:39.991 --> 38:41.458
- No, you!
- Mikey.

38:42.326 --> 38:44.317
Off your brother.

38:44.428 --> 38:46.623
- You two get yourselves cleaned up.
- Hey, come back here!

38:47.765 --> 38:49.756
Dinner in 30.

39:02.747 --> 39:03.714
Hello?

39:04.749 --> 39:06.239
<i>Sarah Cavanaugh?</i>

39:07.285 --> 39:08.252
Yes.

39:09.186 --> 39:11.484
<i>This is Special Agent Wilkins
of the FBI.</i>

39:12.523 --> 39:15.083
<i>I need to ask you a few questions
about Jack Riley.</i>

39:39.083 --> 39:40.948
Hey. You're early.

39:41.052 --> 39:43.043
Mike, can I get on your computer?

39:43.154 --> 39:45.179
- Sure.
- You got high-speed, right?

39:45.289 --> 39:47.917
- Why? What is it?
- It's Jack.

39:51.062 --> 39:53.428
Come on. Come on.

39:53.531 --> 39:54.793
- What's goin' on?
- It's loading.

39:59.837 --> 40:01.566
What do you see? Come on.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.839
What is it?

40:03.941 --> 40:05.738
They want my credit card.

40:14.118 --> 40:15.745
- Okay.
- What you got?

40:15.853 --> 40:16.478
Jack.

40:16.587 --> 40:18.282
- Holy shit. That's Jack.
- Yeah, I know.

40:19.357 --> 40:21.018
I'm sorry.

40:21.759 --> 40:23.317
"KKK member"?

40:23.427 --> 40:25.327
- Hey. What's it say?
- Wait.

40:25.429 --> 40:26.919
What's it say?

40:27.031 --> 40:29.761
"Bombed a clinic for the handicapped
and the mentally retarded"?

40:29.867 --> 40:33.030
- "Fled to El Salvador."
- El Salvador?

40:33.137 --> 40:34.695
It's all lies.

40:35.406 --> 40:36.873
I gotta see this.

40:39.543 --> 40:41.374
Try the live stream.

41:21.052 --> 41:22.383
Paco.

42:27.918 --> 42:29.715
Very romantic.

42:30.421 --> 42:33.549
I can't remember. Did I tell you
how sexy I thought your missus was?

42:40.664 --> 42:42.495
Come on, Mr. Angry.

42:48.606 --> 42:50.631
Speed, baby!
That's what that is!

42:53.010 --> 42:54.341
Come on!

43:03.020 --> 43:04.248
Paco!

43:11.695 --> 43:13.993
Don't you just love it
when that happens?

43:28.979 --> 43:31.379
Calm down. Calm down.

43:33.584 --> 43:36.178
I'll fucking slap you, you keep on.

43:37.288 --> 43:39.483
Just want to be friends.

43:39.590 --> 43:41.387
I didn't want this.

43:42.226 --> 43:43.693
How is that? The knee?

43:47.731 --> 43:49.790
There, there.

43:52.937 --> 43:54.404
You smell that?

43:56.073 --> 43:59.236
That's love.
Love in the air, that is.

44:00.477 --> 44:02.240
You're a lucky man.

44:04.081 --> 44:06.049
That is one fit bird you got there.

44:06.150 --> 44:07.879
Paco!

44:12.857 --> 44:14.051
Rosa!

44:21.932 --> 44:23.695
Easy, son. Easy, easy.

44:28.706 --> 44:30.298
That's no way to treat a lady.

44:31.275 --> 44:33.175
Is it, sweetheart?

44:34.778 --> 44:36.405
Fiery little thing, isn't ya?

44:39.984 --> 44:41.781
Little wildcat.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.088
Have a look at those titties here.

44:52.296 --> 44:53.558
Please, no!

44:58.068 --> 44:59.695
No! Stop!

45:01.572 --> 45:02.630
Rosa!

45:07.478 --> 45:08.570
Fuckin' bitch!

45:11.248 --> 45:12.476
Rosa!

45:25.162 --> 45:27.323
- Paco!
- Watch this, hombre!

45:44.448 --> 45:47.645
- How many angles do we have on this?
- This is all we got.

45:47.751 --> 45:49.548
Well, this coverage is no good.

45:50.421 --> 45:51.945
Eddie.

45:52.056 --> 45:53.648
Where's the live unit?

45:54.425 --> 45:55.722
Not far.

45:56.493 --> 45:57.960
Get 'em over there.

46:16.413 --> 46:18.142
<i>Keep still!</i>

46:26.423 --> 46:28.789
Eddie. Numbers.

46:28.892 --> 46:31.156
We're climbin'.
Around 15 mil.

46:32.196 --> 46:33.163
Stop this.

46:34.531 --> 46:35.498
What?

46:36.233 --> 46:38.360
What? Stop this.

46:38.469 --> 46:40.869
Baby, come on.
She's a killer and a whore.

46:40.971 --> 46:42.461
She's a human being.

46:42.573 --> 46:45.337
Yeah. Who went on a killing spree
with her husband.

46:45.442 --> 46:47.842
They were gonna execute her
in Guatemala. Remember?

46:48.679 --> 46:50.670
No. No. This is wrong.

46:50.781 --> 46:52.510
- This is sick.
- You know what?

46:52.616 --> 46:55.016
The drama... I want it up there.

46:55.119 --> 46:57.053
Not here. Okay? Please.

46:57.154 --> 47:00.055
Ian, how can you let this go on?

47:00.157 --> 47:03.593
It's just happening.
And we're shooting it. It's not my doing.

47:04.628 --> 47:06.095
It is your doing.

47:07.197 --> 47:08.721
You set it up.

47:08.832 --> 47:11.062
I put 10 people out there,
and whatever happens, happens.

47:11.168 --> 47:13.329
Pure reality.

47:13.437 --> 47:15.371
<i>- Yeah.
- No intervention.</i>

47:17.608 --> 47:19.337
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

47:20.944 --> 47:21.968
Fresh air.

47:23.981 --> 47:25.175
What?

47:25.282 --> 47:27.409
You're getting all soft
on me, are you?

47:29.353 --> 47:32.015
I'm gonna hear a crybaby story
from you too?

47:32.122 --> 47:34.147
Or are we just having
a crisis of conscience?

47:34.258 --> 47:35.885
No, Breck. It's not... It's...

47:38.328 --> 47:40.091
It's...

47:43.300 --> 47:45.928
It's not exactly easy to watch.

47:48.705 --> 47:50.798
But I'm with ya.

47:52.076 --> 47:54.044
Eddie, are you with me?

47:54.144 --> 47:56.738
Hell yeah. I love this job.

47:56.847 --> 47:57.905
Bella?

47:58.015 --> 48:01.041
I love what I do.
We're a team, Breck.

48:01.151 --> 48:05.247
Good. You know, Eddie and Bella,
you two give me hope for the future.

48:15.966 --> 48:17.957
That's one angry bitch.

48:28.679 --> 48:32.274
Don't worry about him.
He won't get far.

49:20.831 --> 49:23.322
Amigo, what happened?

49:28.472 --> 49:30.372
Amigo, talk to me.

49:30.474 --> 49:33.534
- What's goin' on?
- I'm gonna kill them.

49:38.782 --> 49:40.841
We've got company.
Just keep it down.

49:48.959 --> 49:50.654
Come on.

49:55.332 --> 49:57.266
You help me to kill them.

49:57.367 --> 49:59.335
Together we could kill them both.

49:59.436 --> 50:01.233
You're not making sense.

50:03.874 --> 50:06.069
They took her like a dog.

50:06.877 --> 50:08.344
They cut her.

50:09.446 --> 50:11.073
And they made me...

50:15.485 --> 50:17.510
You help me to get them.
You help me to...

50:17.621 --> 50:19.612
No, I'll help you stay alive.

50:21.625 --> 50:23.718
Get yourself together.

50:25.462 --> 50:28.522
<i>- Now get up.
- I can't, ese.</i>

50:28.632 --> 50:31.100
My knee is broke.

51:01.131 --> 51:02.962
Calm down.

51:03.867 --> 51:06.165
I don't want to kill you.

51:06.270 --> 51:09.262
I just want to get
this bomb off my leg.

51:10.707 --> 51:12.641
<i>You can trust me.</i>

51:23.353 --> 51:25.719
- He's letting her go?
- For fuck's sake. What is this?

51:25.822 --> 51:27.517
Friendship Island?

51:48.679 --> 51:50.340
How's your knee?

51:50.446 --> 51:52.971
I can't walk.
I can't fight.

51:53.849 --> 51:57.751
I can't do nothing but limp around
with this fucking stick.

52:03.059 --> 52:05.027
You kill them for me.

52:05.861 --> 52:07.726
You kill both of them for me.

52:08.597 --> 52:12.795
Hey, I'm sorry, amigo.
There's something I gotta do.

52:15.237 --> 52:16.704
What you gotta do?

52:20.543 --> 52:23.478
I saw a weather tower
on the north end of the island.

52:24.780 --> 52:26.247
There's gotta be a radio in there.

52:26.349 --> 52:28.078
You call for help?

52:28.851 --> 52:30.546
We're light-years from help, man.

52:32.788 --> 52:34.688
So who you call?

52:36.292 --> 52:38.487
You got a woman...

52:38.594 --> 52:40.084
or a wife?

52:41.964 --> 52:42.931
Yeah.

52:44.367 --> 52:45.994
Something like that.

53:01.117 --> 53:04.780
Drop a Christmas bag to McStarley.
Give him the works.

53:04.887 --> 53:07.219
Send him to the Japanese ruins.

53:32.915 --> 53:35.213
I'll take that.
Think that's got my name on it.

53:40.356 --> 53:42.881
We got everything
but a kitchen sink in here, mate.

53:43.926 --> 53:46.895
We got knives...
Look at this.

53:46.996 --> 53:48.122
Cigars.

53:49.098 --> 53:51.396
Someone up there likes us, boy.

53:52.134 --> 53:54.568
We've won the fucking jackpot, mate.

53:59.041 --> 54:02.204
You better limber up, son.
We got a show to put on.

54:05.748 --> 54:07.648
Settle yourself down a bit.

54:07.750 --> 54:09.945
Jesus.

54:42.585 --> 54:44.177
What you doing?

54:45.454 --> 54:48.184
You see that? GPS.

54:50.893 --> 54:52.554
I don't like being tracked.

55:04.273 --> 55:08.767
Hey, Breck.
Conrad kind of just vanished.

55:10.446 --> 55:13.415
- Vanished?
- He's gone. He's not on my grille.

55:13.516 --> 55:15.780
I just lost his signal.

55:22.858 --> 55:24.325
You got some water.

55:29.965 --> 55:31.432
Take this.

56:33.762 --> 56:35.229
Found him.

56:39.868 --> 56:41.335
Where's he going?

56:43.172 --> 56:45.140
I don't know.

56:46.375 --> 56:47.933
Keep an eye on him.

56:48.043 --> 56:49.169
Yeah.

56:57.086 --> 56:59.919
We have to drop the investigation
into Jack Riley.

57:00.022 --> 57:01.922
Two Americans are trapped
in this thing, sir.

57:02.024 --> 57:05.721
Brad, this is not
a conversation, okay?

57:05.828 --> 57:08.456
Just hours ago, you told me
to get to the bottom of it.

57:08.564 --> 57:10.464
Now why are you
telling me to drop it?

57:10.566 --> 57:12.466
When you started
digging into Jack Riley...

57:12.568 --> 57:15.332
you caused a lot of people
a lot of stress where I work.

57:15.437 --> 57:18.099
- And where is that?
- The Pentagon.

57:18.207 --> 57:20.539
This is Wade Meranto, DIA.

57:20.643 --> 57:23.111
We know all there is to know
about Jack Riley.

57:23.212 --> 57:25.043
Is he a killer or not?

57:25.147 --> 57:27.672
Well, he's probably killed more men
than anyone on that island.

57:27.783 --> 57:31.844
He did 14 years Special Forces
detachment Delta.

57:31.954 --> 57:36.891
He retired, but his old boss...
my boss...

57:36.992 --> 57:39.017
calls him up from time to time.

57:39.128 --> 57:40.220
Black ops.

57:41.263 --> 57:45.290
Ayear ago he was sent to El Salvador
to demolish a Vallejo drug plant...

57:46.335 --> 57:48.633
profits being used
to fund our enemies.

57:48.737 --> 57:51.831
Got the job done,
killed several men...

57:52.941 --> 57:56.672
all known drug traffickers
with the Vallejo Cartel.

57:56.779 --> 57:58.337
And he got caught.

57:58.447 --> 58:01.678
He traveled with bogus papers
in the name of Jack Conrad.

58:01.784 --> 58:05.618
His real name and who he worked for
was never uncovered...

58:05.721 --> 58:07.245
although they tried.

58:07.356 --> 58:10.689
So you let him fry in a Central American
prison for an entire year?

58:10.793 --> 58:13.318
People like Jack Riley
get paid well.

58:14.363 --> 58:17.696
And they get hired for the same
reason they get fired...

58:17.800 --> 58:19.700
to keep DC brass clean.

58:19.802 --> 58:21.360
It's politics.

58:22.471 --> 58:24.132
It's bullshit.

58:33.582 --> 58:34.549
Nope.

58:39.421 --> 58:44.552
Okay. Breck, as you can see,
the American-Yul Brynner... he is gone.

58:44.660 --> 58:46.594
He is off my monitors completely.

58:46.695 --> 58:48.595
I had him and then I lost him.

58:48.697 --> 58:52.155
And the reason why I lost him
is because he is headed towards us.

58:52.267 --> 58:54.701
And I did not rig cameras
where we are at.

58:55.437 --> 58:59.806
And quite frankly, it's disturbing.

58:59.908 --> 59:02.638
- Relax, Goldy.
- You know what?

59:02.745 --> 59:06.442
I'm gonna relax when killers and rapists
are on the other side of the island.

59:06.548 --> 59:08.015
Is that cool?

59:11.887 --> 59:13.514
I'll find him.

59:18.494 --> 59:21.292
You two take the jeep.
We'll take the dogs on foot. Let's go.

59:25.734 --> 59:28.464
Take the south road,
do a circle and come back.

59:28.570 --> 59:29.901
Yep, you got it.

59:41.049 --> 59:42.744
- Check the perimeter.
- All right.

01:00:53.188 --> 01:00:57.420
<i>This is Zodiac here.
806028.</i>

01:01:03.966 --> 01:01:07.800
<i>...65 degrees.
22.32 west. Over.</i>

01:01:26.588 --> 01:01:28.055
Take one of these.

01:01:34.196 --> 01:01:35.163
Hello?

01:01:35.264 --> 01:01:36.959
<i>Sarah, it's me.</i>

01:01:39.668 --> 01:01:40.794
<i>Sarah?</i>

01:01:43.171 --> 01:01:45.799
<i>Jack, are you okay?</i>

01:01:45.908 --> 01:01:48.069
Just listen.
I don't have much time.

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:51.142
Why haven't you contacted me?

01:01:51.246 --> 01:01:53.441
<i>For your own safety.</i>

01:01:53.548 --> 01:01:55.641
Did you think I walked out on you?

01:01:55.751 --> 01:01:57.719
I didn't know what to think.

01:01:59.454 --> 01:02:01.422
I've been through this before.

01:02:02.257 --> 01:02:04.157
And then...

01:02:04.259 --> 01:02:06.284
<i>- And then you leave me.
- Sarah, listen to me.</i>

01:02:06.395 --> 01:02:08.090
<i>Why?</i>

01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:10.630
I did not walk out on you.

01:02:11.667 --> 01:02:13.134
I love you.

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:17.234
I love those boys of yours
like my own.

01:02:18.273 --> 01:02:20.400
<i>You understand that?</i>

01:02:20.509 --> 01:02:23.740
- Jack, I...
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:02:23.845 --> 01:02:27.076
I'm not through.
Grab yourself a pen.

01:02:27.816 --> 01:02:29.283
<i>Write this down.</i>

01:02:31.353 --> 01:02:33.253
<i>Cross National Bank.</i>

01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:37.121
- 2543456.
- Jack, what is this?

01:02:37.225 --> 01:02:39.159
What are you doing?

01:02:39.261 --> 01:02:41.161
I got some money saved up.

01:02:41.263 --> 01:02:45.324
It ain't much, but I'll feel better
knowing you have it.

01:02:46.234 --> 01:02:49.499
<i>Maybe it'll help things out
around the house with you and the kids.</i>

01:02:50.772 --> 01:02:52.034
Money?

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.506
You know I don't want money, Jack.
I want you.

01:02:54.609 --> 01:02:56.770
And I want you to take this
just in case.

01:02:56.878 --> 01:02:58.004
<i>Just in case?</i>

01:02:58.113 --> 01:03:00.843
Ayear ago, you say
you're leaving for work...

01:03:00.949 --> 01:03:02.849
and I don't hear from you till now?

01:03:03.819 --> 01:03:05.286
<i>Where've you been, Jack?</i>

01:03:05.387 --> 01:03:07.582
You gotta tell me
what's going on, Jack.

01:03:07.689 --> 01:03:09.953
- Just listen to me.
- You gotta tell me now.

01:03:10.058 --> 01:03:13.221
<i>I want you back here with me.
That's all I want.</i>

01:03:13.328 --> 01:03:15.296
<i>Tell me you're coming home.</i>

01:03:16.164 --> 01:03:18.632
<i>Do you understand me?
I need you.</i>

01:03:18.734 --> 01:03:20.702
I need you back here with me.

01:03:20.869 --> 01:03:22.894
Breck, we got a breach of the gate.

01:03:27.576 --> 01:03:29.043
He's in the tower.

01:03:36.518 --> 01:03:39.885
- What's goin' on?
- It's Conrad. He's here.

01:03:40.922 --> 01:03:42.913
Oh, great. That's nice.
Right here with us.

01:03:43.025 --> 01:03:45.357
Shut the tower down.
Kill the generator.

01:03:46.728 --> 01:03:48.821
- I gotta go.
- No, wait.

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:52.388
I spoke to an FBI agent.
Where are you?

01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:54.526
<i>Tell me something.
They've got nothing.</i>

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.597
- Jack?
- I'm here. Hang on.

01:04:00.308 --> 01:04:01.900
All right.
Write this down.

01:04:03.011 --> 01:04:06.538
<i>Latitude 7.549282.</i>

01:04:06.648 --> 01:04:08.548
Longitude is...

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:11.517
Jack? Jack!

01:04:12.821 --> 01:04:14.550
Stay back.
I'm coming.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:16.985
No! God.

01:04:43.318 --> 01:04:44.910
There he is!

01:04:48.056 --> 01:04:49.887
Fuck! Move it!

01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:51.959
- He's out! He's out!
- Go! Go!

01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:56.860
Hi. May I speak
to Agent Brad Wilkins?

01:04:56.965 --> 01:04:59.900
<i>- I'm sorry. He's in a meeting.
- It's urgent.</i>

01:05:00.802 --> 01:05:04.169
All right. Riley's contacted
Sarah Cavanaugh with a coordinate.

01:05:04.272 --> 01:05:06.331
The island's somewhere
on the seventh parallel.

01:05:07.042 --> 01:05:08.669
I got it right here.

01:05:13.915 --> 01:05:16.748
Please tell me that
we're gonna do something.

01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:19.919
Jack Riley did a year
in a Salvadorean prison.

01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:21.352
Interrogation.

01:05:21.456 --> 01:05:22.548
Torture.

01:05:23.692 --> 01:05:27.492
He never gave up a word.
All to protect you...

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:30.397
his country.

01:05:52.187 --> 01:05:54.417
What a woman like you do
to end up here?

01:05:56.925 --> 01:05:58.517
Plenty.

01:06:02.464 --> 01:06:04.364
You know we're gonna die.

01:06:04.466 --> 01:06:06.491
I fight till the end.

01:06:06.601 --> 01:06:09.661
This is the end.
Wake up and have a cup.

01:06:11.206 --> 01:06:12.673
Are you okay?

01:06:12.774 --> 01:06:14.901
Threw me from the chopper.
I landed wrong.

01:06:19.281 --> 01:06:21.806
How's that feel?

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.820
Awful. Just awful.

01:06:26.922 --> 01:06:28.822
Stop, please. Stop.

01:06:28.924 --> 01:06:31.154
- You want me to stop?
- Oh, yeah, stop.

01:06:31.259 --> 01:06:32.385
Hello.

01:06:34.129 --> 01:06:35.596
I think they're gonna get it on.

01:06:35.697 --> 01:06:38.723
<i>You say the last time
you trusted a woman...</i>

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:40.630
<i>you ended up on death row.</i>

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:42.202
<i>What happened?</i>

01:06:43.305 --> 01:06:45.136
Well, get this.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.071
I'm bein' transferred to Folsom.

01:06:47.175 --> 01:06:48.642
A stroke of luck.

01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:52.611
In transit, I bust out,
make my way to Mexico.

01:06:53.348 --> 01:06:55.441
I'm off to Malaysia.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:57.780
And I got nothin'.

01:06:57.886 --> 01:07:00.184
I set up my own hash spot.

01:07:02.224 --> 01:07:05.193
I started seein' this native girl.

01:07:06.661 --> 01:07:08.185
<i>Beautiful...</i>

01:07:08.296 --> 01:07:09.854
sweet, sexy.

01:07:09.965 --> 01:07:11.432
I'm in heaven.

01:07:12.534 --> 01:07:15.401
I'm rich, I'm free, in love.

01:07:15.503 --> 01:07:19.633
She get nailed on some
bullshit possession charge.

01:07:19.741 --> 01:07:22.301
She tell the cops everything.

01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:26.403
Man, when they come, I got
14 pounds of hash under the bed.

01:07:26.514 --> 01:07:28.448
You know what that means
in Malaysia?

01:07:30.619 --> 01:07:32.610
Death row again.

01:07:35.223 --> 01:07:38.249
It's just gonna take some time
before I let my guards down.

01:07:39.027 --> 01:07:40.494
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:07:41.696 --> 01:07:43.288
You feel me, baby?

01:07:45.267 --> 01:07:47.167
Hey, baby, where you at?

01:07:52.207 --> 01:07:54.471
Bitch got me again!
Motherfucker!

01:07:54.576 --> 01:07:56.601
Not again! Not again! Not...

01:08:02.517 --> 01:08:03.984
Very clever.

01:08:06.554 --> 01:08:07.680
Smokin'.

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:12.257
- What the hell just happened?
- Another one bites the dust.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.590
The black American dude, gone.

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:21.063
Get this off and get on
something else now.

01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:22.636
Okay? Change it.

01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:24.665
Oh, nice.

01:08:24.773 --> 01:08:26.707
Mexican's down.

01:08:26.808 --> 01:08:28.399
For the count.

01:08:30.278 --> 01:08:31.540
Jesus Christ.

01:08:31.645 --> 01:08:35.446
Sun ain't even up and the Mexican's
having another bad day.

01:08:36.184 --> 01:08:39.051
McStarley's back.
This is gonna be gnarly.

01:08:39.988 --> 01:08:45.290
Okay, cover the mess.

01:08:45.993 --> 01:08:47.621
<i>You're deadI</i>

01:08:49.096 --> 01:08:50.997
Good times.

01:08:51.099 --> 01:08:52.794
Twenty-eight million I D's
are logged on...

01:08:52.901 --> 01:08:56.462
<i>- Hit him again!
- watchin' beaner boy get his ass beat.</i>

01:08:57.505 --> 01:08:58.971
He's not even trying.

01:09:17.325 --> 01:09:18.814
He's my boss...

01:09:20.929 --> 01:09:22.692
and yet he's my best friend.

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:24.898
A genius.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.660
The man could sell dirt
to a ditchdigger.

01:09:33.274 --> 01:09:34.832
We've both been sold.

01:09:37.145 --> 01:09:38.270
I know.

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.406
Goldy, we have to stop this.

01:09:53.528 --> 01:09:55.223
<i>Let me get hold ofhim.
Hold on.</i>

01:09:57.332 --> 01:10:01.462
This is not reality.
You manipulated this.

01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:04.163
You sent them there so they could
do this to an injured man...

01:10:04.272 --> 01:10:06.206
who's already
watched his wife get...

01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:13.970
Don't tell me you won't intervene,
because you already have.

01:10:16.117 --> 01:10:18.244
Twenty-eight million people
watching something I created.

01:10:19.988 --> 01:10:22.548
And not a single network
gets a piece of it.

01:10:27.295 --> 01:10:29.058
It's too much for me, Breck.

01:10:29.798 --> 01:10:32.824
I mean, I knew
what this was originally.

01:10:32.934 --> 01:10:36.392
But it is not okay now.
It's too much.

01:10:36.504 --> 01:10:40.497
We have now crossed a line that is beyond
the line that I thought we were gonna cross.

01:10:40.608 --> 01:10:45.045
All right. All right. Some of it's
a little difficult to watch, okay?

01:10:45.146 --> 01:10:46.773
But it's essential.

01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:51.748
To create drama you need
good guys, bad guys and victims.

01:10:51.853 --> 01:10:53.320
All right?
That's storytelling.

01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:56.754
No. This is not a teleplay
that you are writing.

01:10:56.858 --> 01:11:00.817
This is real. It's too fuckin' real,
and I can't hold down food.

01:11:00.929 --> 01:11:01.918
Real?

01:11:03.298 --> 01:11:04.356
Nothing's real.

01:11:04.466 --> 01:11:08.368
CNN, ABC, MTV...

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:12.236
all manufactured and manipulated
just like this.

01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:15.131
To entertain.

01:11:16.611 --> 01:11:20.877
Goldy, do you think this guy had more dignity
awaiting the electric chair in Guatemala City?

01:11:24.152 --> 01:11:26.143
Yeah. I do.

01:11:26.254 --> 01:11:29.781
You ungrateful son of bitch.
I made you very rich.

01:11:29.891 --> 01:11:33.292
You do not come in here and team up
against me with her. You understand?

01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:39.532
You both knew what you were getting into.
Both of you.

01:11:42.303 --> 01:11:45.363
I'm done debating this.
You make a choice right now.

01:11:45.473 --> 01:11:47.498
Either you're with me
or against me...

01:11:48.743 --> 01:11:50.210
but I want your answer.

01:11:53.648 --> 01:11:55.411
Right now.

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:03.357
Right now.

01:12:06.494 --> 01:12:07.961
What'll it be?

01:12:17.038 --> 01:12:18.505
I'm gonna finish the show.

01:12:18.606 --> 01:12:20.198
- You can't do the show.
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:12:20.308 --> 01:12:22.868
- You know this as well as I do!
- I don't wanna hear it!

01:12:22.977 --> 01:12:26.071
- I'm goin' back to the monitors.
- Goldman! Goldy!

01:12:37.025 --> 01:12:40.085
Any idea how ridiculous you've
sounded in the last 24 hours?

01:12:40.194 --> 01:12:43.391
What, are you trying to save
some goddamn whore?

01:12:53.174 --> 01:12:55.199
I was trying to save you.

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:28.342
Nice.

01:13:33.948 --> 01:13:36.781
- Hey!
- Hey, Yank!

01:13:36.884 --> 01:13:40.081
- Where you been all night?
- He's had enough!

01:13:41.222 --> 01:13:42.189
Enough?

01:13:45.059 --> 01:13:48.028
You think this little
Mexican geezer's had enough?

01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:50.823
Shit! We ain't even started.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.828
Hit him again.

01:13:55.303 --> 01:13:57.168
Beauty!

01:14:01.376 --> 01:14:03.936
What do you think?
I might hit him from here, Yank.

01:14:06.447 --> 01:14:07.778
Hold still, fucker!

01:14:10.418 --> 01:14:13.717
You're out!
You like that, Yank?

01:14:14.956 --> 01:14:17.117
Yo, Yank.

01:14:18.393 --> 01:14:21.123
I got you down as military...
like myself.

01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:23.288
Special Forces, SAS.

01:14:23.398 --> 01:14:25.195
Me and you, we got a lot in common.

01:14:25.299 --> 01:14:27.893
We got nothin' in common,
you and me.

01:14:28.002 --> 01:14:31.961
That disappoints me.
That makes you soft.

01:14:32.807 --> 01:14:35.867
But not me.
I'm the real deal.

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:41.841
This... I'm gonna do for you.

01:14:47.922 --> 01:14:49.549
Burn, baby, burn!

01:14:58.299 --> 01:14:59.926
Game on.

01:15:44.212 --> 01:15:46.373
- What is that place?
- I don't know.

01:16:41.736 --> 01:16:43.101
Conrad.

01:17:40.695 --> 01:17:42.322
Get up!

01:17:49.871 --> 01:17:50.701
Come on!

01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:01.815
Go around!

01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:15.719
Shit.

01:18:17.131 --> 01:18:20.259
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
- Try me.

01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:31.444
Bull's-eye!
Come on, Yank!

01:18:33.314 --> 01:18:35.373
Show yourself!

01:18:35.483 --> 01:18:36.973
Get me inside that bunker.

01:18:44.592 --> 01:18:46.958
Show yourself! I'll put this
right through your fuckin' heart.

01:18:47.061 --> 01:18:48.961
Son of a bitch.

01:18:49.063 --> 01:18:51.088
Get up.
Get up. Come on.

01:18:57.405 --> 01:18:58.599
Come on, Yank!

01:19:02.076 --> 01:19:03.509
Oh, God.

01:19:04.445 --> 01:19:06.675
That's great.
Torched the cameras.

01:19:06.781 --> 01:19:09.511
Both my cameras are torched.
I got nothin' left inside.

01:19:15.623 --> 01:19:17.181
Run, baby. Go. Go.

01:19:21.295 --> 01:19:22.262
Yeah!

01:19:28.135 --> 01:19:29.966
Give me your hand.

01:19:31.939 --> 01:19:33.668
What are you doing?

01:21:16.177 --> 01:21:17.303
Hey, kid.

01:21:20.748 --> 01:21:22.648
Holy shit! It's Jack!

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.344
Yeah! Yeah!

01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:28.720
All right!

01:21:41.869 --> 01:21:43.962
Let's go, sweetheart.

01:23:46.827 --> 01:23:47.794
Let's go.

01:23:49.230 --> 01:23:50.925
Just you and me.

01:23:51.665 --> 01:23:53.132
Let's dance, asshole.

01:23:53.968 --> 01:23:55.629
Not today.

01:24:03.711 --> 01:24:06.236
He won't, man.
He won't jump.

01:24:09.016 --> 01:24:10.108
Fuck it.

01:24:30.571 --> 01:24:32.095
- Okay, so where are they?
- I'm looking.

01:24:32.206 --> 01:24:33.571
- Come on.
- I'm looking.

01:24:33.674 --> 01:24:35.869
Where are they? Find 'em.

01:24:35.976 --> 01:24:38.308
For God's sake. What, you don't
have a camera down there?

01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:40.607
Do I look like Jacques Cousteau?
I don't do underwater caves.

01:24:40.714 --> 01:24:42.648
- Hence, dead spots.
- Eddie, what do you have?

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:44.817
I got nothin'.

01:24:46.353 --> 01:24:47.911
For Christ's sakes.

01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:03.769
Found him.
He's in the canyon.

01:25:03.871 --> 01:25:05.930
I've got angles, lots of angles.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.201
Get the live unit down there.

01:25:08.309 --> 01:25:10.140
Where's my boy McStarley?

01:25:41.608 --> 01:25:44.338
<i>Yes. Happy days.</i>

01:25:44.445 --> 01:25:45.912
Now for the big finish.

01:25:46.013 --> 01:25:48.675
You helped this maniac
the entire time...

01:25:48.782 --> 01:25:52.149
manipulated the whole thing.

01:25:53.787 --> 01:25:55.482
He puts on a good show.

01:25:56.223 --> 01:25:57.815
I threw him a bone.

01:25:58.926 --> 01:26:00.223
Hey, Yank!

01:26:00.327 --> 01:26:02.727
You lookin' for me,
you piece of shit?

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:06.698
You dance, Yank?
Let's see you dance now!

01:26:12.473 --> 01:26:14.703
- Come on, you fucker!
- Cocksucker.

01:26:14.808 --> 01:26:17.072
Show yourself!
I'll blow your fuckin' balls off!

01:26:17.177 --> 01:26:18.201
Fuck you.

01:26:20.381 --> 01:26:22.872
- Shit.
- You want some more, you fucker?

01:26:22.983 --> 01:26:24.211
<i>Come on!</i>

01:26:24.318 --> 01:26:26.843
Let's finish this man to man!

01:26:45.639 --> 01:26:46.731
Hey!

01:26:49.743 --> 01:26:51.802
Show your bald head,
you motherfucker!

01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:26.072
Show's over, Yank!

01:27:28.449 --> 01:27:30.815
What do you think this is?
A fancy dress party?

01:27:35.456 --> 01:27:38.152
- I'm just a cameraman.
- Film this.

01:27:50.571 --> 01:27:52.095
Merry Christmas.

01:28:47.561 --> 01:28:48.528
Come on!

01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:50.529
You motherfucker!
How do you like this?

01:28:53.834 --> 01:28:56.029
Come on, Jack!
Yeah! There you go!

01:28:56.136 --> 01:28:57.763
Come on, you cocksucker!

01:29:05.979 --> 01:29:07.071
Shit!

01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:40.104
Jack. No, no.

01:29:55.596 --> 01:29:58.565
<i>Nothing we do as entertainers
are gonna make a difference, all right?</i>

01:29:58.665 --> 01:30:00.132
<i>You just think about it.</i>

01:30:00.233 --> 01:30:02.724
<i>Just some of the games
and the movies that we make...</i>

01:30:02.836 --> 01:30:05.600
<i>it helps them to escape
into that world for 'em.</i>

01:30:05.706 --> 01:30:07.970
<i>You know what I mean?
That's being a teenager, right? Teenagers...</i>

01:30:08.075 --> 01:30:11.067
<i>- They're just teenagers.
- So, what about children?</i>

01:30:12.546 --> 01:30:15.777
<i>Kids all across the planet can
log on and witness live murder?</i>

01:30:15.882 --> 01:30:18.316
<i>Yeah, sure. They can.
If they have a credit card.</i>

01:30:18.418 --> 01:30:20.511
<i>Look, Donna, we, as entertainers...</i>

01:30:20.621 --> 01:30:23.613
<i>cannot tailor-make everything
we do for children.</i>

01:30:23.724 --> 01:30:27.251
<i>It's the parents'responsibility
to monitor what their kids watch.</i>

01:30:27.361 --> 01:30:30.159
<i>That's a cop-out, Ian,
and you know it.</i>

01:30:30.263 --> 01:30:32.163
<i>You have to take
some responsibility.</i>

01:30:32.265 --> 01:30:34.460
<i>Donna, I'm not forcing anybody
to log on and tune in.</i>

01:30:34.568 --> 01:30:37.594
<i>I create shows people like to watch.
I didn't create the demand.</i>

01:30:37.704 --> 01:30:40.264
<i>People like to watch violence.</i>

01:30:40.374 --> 01:30:42.103
<i>They always have.</i>

01:30:42.209 --> 01:30:43.676
<i>Probably always will.</i>

01:30:45.512 --> 01:30:49.505
<i>When I finished this interview,
I was angry at one man...</i>

01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:52.347
<i>Ian Breckel.</i>

01:30:53.787 --> 01:30:56.551
<i>I now realize my reaction
was simplistic.</i>

01:30:57.324 --> 01:31:00.725
<i>Over the past 24 hours,
millions have logged on to his Web site.</i>

01:31:00.827 --> 01:31:04.024
<i>And with his success
I am no longer angry.</i>

01:31:05.198 --> 01:31:06.995
<i>I am sad.</i>

01:31:09.236 --> 01:31:10.703
<i>Those of us who reward him...</i>

01:31:12.873 --> 01:31:14.704
<i>those of us who watch...</i>

01:31:17.277 --> 01:31:20.246
<i>are we the condemned?</i>

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:27.777
<i>Until tomorrow,
this is Donna Sereno.</i>

01:31:34.828 --> 01:31:37.160
You'll be pleased to know
they found the island.

01:31:37.264 --> 01:31:39.664
Navy SEALs will be there
in one hour.

01:31:42.235 --> 01:31:43.702
It's too late.

01:31:49.443 --> 01:31:51.343
Hey, Breck, check it out.

01:31:53.146 --> 01:31:56.047
- Forty million.
- 171 countries worldwide.

01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:59.084
Bella, you have the new
highlights reel cut together?

01:31:59.186 --> 01:32:00.653
Done.

01:32:00.754 --> 01:32:03.587
Run that until we bring
our winner back.

01:32:04.758 --> 01:32:06.419
We'll film a closing ceremony.

01:32:07.461 --> 01:32:08.928
We did it, Breck.

01:32:15.769 --> 01:32:19.569
- What do you got?
- We've been spotted. US Navy.

01:32:21.808 --> 01:32:23.901
How do you wanna play it?

01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:25.568
Big choppers here?

01:32:25.679 --> 01:32:28.944
No. Just yours. They took
the setup crew back to the mainland.

01:32:31.084 --> 01:32:34.747
All right. I'll collect my things.
You meet me at the chopper in 10 minutes.

01:32:35.856 --> 01:32:37.551
And the crew?

01:32:37.657 --> 01:32:41.320
If the military's coming,
they're coming for me, not them.

01:32:42.362 --> 01:32:44.296
It's my ass that'll fry.

01:32:47.601 --> 01:32:49.193
Meet me at the chopper
in 10 minutes.

01:32:49.302 --> 01:32:50.269
Hi.

01:32:52.639 --> 01:32:53.606
What's up?

01:32:58.178 --> 01:33:00.237
Goin' somewhere, Breck?

01:33:00.347 --> 01:33:02.611
You lied to me.
Where the hell are you goin'?

01:33:02.716 --> 01:33:05.480
- What's up?
- What's up? The navy's coming.

01:33:05.585 --> 01:33:08.918
You can't just leave everybody here.
You promised that you would take care of us.

01:33:09.022 --> 01:33:11.923
- You promised that we would go with you.
- Things have changed, Goldy.

01:33:12.025 --> 01:33:14.755
Fuck that.
I'm gonna tell everybody, shithead.

01:33:14.861 --> 01:33:17.762
Bella, Eddie, Julie...
I'm tellin' everyone.

01:33:17.864 --> 01:33:20.458
We're comin', or you're gonna have
a big fuckin' riot on your hands.

01:33:20.567 --> 01:33:24.401
Okay, okay. I'll take you, all right?
I'll give you a million, cash.

01:33:24.504 --> 01:33:27.371
A million? We talked about
five percent of the net.

01:33:27.474 --> 01:33:30.307
You owe me millions, not a million.

01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:33.709
You're a technician, below the line.
You don't get back end.

01:33:33.814 --> 01:33:36.612
I don't get a...
You motherfucking piece of...

01:33:52.966 --> 01:33:55.958
Don't, don't! Stop!

01:33:56.069 --> 01:33:58.128
Stop! Please, no. Don't!

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.294
Congratulations.
You won.

01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:31.993
You're free.

01:34:33.573 --> 01:34:35.768
How about takin'
this bomb off my leg?

01:34:51.157 --> 01:34:52.715
Enjoy your new life.

01:34:52.826 --> 01:34:54.453
Hey!

01:34:55.395 --> 01:34:57.226
Don't take the piss.

01:34:57.330 --> 01:34:59.298
Where's my fuckin' money?

01:35:00.634 --> 01:35:04.092
You should be happy with what
I'm giving you. You're a free man.

01:35:04.204 --> 01:35:05.796
Me and you had an arrangement.

01:35:06.673 --> 01:35:09.904
I give you a good show, I win it...

01:35:11.011 --> 01:35:12.535
you make me a free man.

01:35:12.646 --> 01:35:15.774
But a free man needs
a big bankroll, my friend.

01:35:17.584 --> 01:35:20.075
Me and you, we had a deal.

01:35:20.186 --> 01:35:23.314
The deal is whatever
I want it to be.

01:35:23.423 --> 01:35:26.620
You won 'cause I let you win.

01:35:29.496 --> 01:35:33.398
Keep him here.
I'll be right back.

01:36:17.577 --> 01:36:19.545
- What's goin' on?
- Sit tight.

01:36:30.090 --> 01:36:31.648
Don't touch me.

01:36:46.973 --> 01:36:48.531
I'll be right back.

01:37:14.634 --> 01:37:16.101
Got a spare smoke?

01:37:18.104 --> 01:37:20.800
I think I deserve one
after the day I've had, lads.

01:37:23.877 --> 01:37:26.402
Good man.
Can I have a light?

01:37:57.410 --> 01:38:01.244
Shut up, you ugly bitch!
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:38:01.347 --> 01:38:05.613
One of you fucking twitches,
I will blow you away!

01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:11.487
Startin' with you, four eyes.

01:38:11.591 --> 01:38:13.058
Where is he?

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:17.557
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:21.667
Fuck!

01:38:21.768 --> 01:38:25.101
You want reality?
Here's my fucking reality!

01:38:25.205 --> 01:38:28.504
God will not help you!
I can help you!

01:38:30.143 --> 01:38:34.011
Shut up!
You! You fucking coward!

01:38:34.114 --> 01:38:35.581
Shut up!

01:38:37.617 --> 01:38:41.246
Get some fucking order in here!
Where are you fucking going?

01:38:45.925 --> 01:38:48.723
Now, have I got
your fucking attention?

01:39:15.755 --> 01:39:17.416
Don't move, redneck.

01:39:25.031 --> 01:39:26.623
Thank you for the show.

01:39:26.733 --> 01:39:28.598
The show ain't over yet.

01:39:31.237 --> 01:39:33.034
I'm gonna kill you.

01:39:34.874 --> 01:39:36.341
I'm gonna kill you too, sweetheart.

01:39:36.442 --> 01:39:38.171
Yeah, whatever,
you fuckin' hillbilly.

01:40:03.903 --> 01:40:05.234
Get up.

01:40:08.308 --> 01:40:09.240
Get up!

01:40:18.551 --> 01:40:20.018
Look me in the eyes.

01:40:24.557 --> 01:40:27.526
Do you enjoy watchin' all this?

01:40:35.134 --> 01:40:36.499
Do ya?

01:40:36.603 --> 01:40:38.230
I'm sorry.

01:40:41.007 --> 01:40:42.474
It's too late.

01:41:36.029 --> 01:41:37.121
Sit.

01:41:38.064 --> 01:41:39.031
Yeah.

01:41:48.574 --> 01:41:50.508
Take it easy, Yank.

01:41:51.611 --> 01:41:53.545
I didn't volunteer for this.

01:41:54.414 --> 01:41:56.814
No one got nothing
they didn't deserve.

01:41:58.885 --> 01:42:00.512
I certainly didn't want
to fight you.

01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:02.053
Bullshit.

01:42:02.155 --> 01:42:03.884
It's not bullshit.

01:42:05.491 --> 01:42:09.325
The military... they sent me to every
hellhole on this fuckin' earth...

01:42:09.429 --> 01:42:11.056
just to do their killin'.

01:42:11.764 --> 01:42:13.391
Then they disowned me.

01:42:13.499 --> 01:42:16.297
Four years in an African prison...

01:42:16.402 --> 01:42:20.532
takin' it up the ass twice a day
by the fuckin' natives.

01:42:23.343 --> 01:42:24.810
That's bullshit.

01:42:25.578 --> 01:42:27.170
Sounds like you had a hard life.

01:42:30.083 --> 01:42:31.311
Yeah.

01:42:31.417 --> 01:42:33.044
Good thing it's over.

01:43:48.728 --> 01:43:50.821
Get us out of here now!

01:43:57.103 --> 01:43:59.003
Fly the fucking thing!

01:44:27.133 --> 01:44:28.259
Shit!
