00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:28.695 --> 00:30.364
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.202
-Captain's orders.
-Move away from your station.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.829
Like he said. Captain's orders.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.625
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.962
Depends on where you're standing.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.097
SHARON: Hi. I got to go. Bye.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.267
My aunt, she's an insomniac. (CHUCKLES)

00:58.809 --> 01:01.436
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.188
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.524
Oh, yeah? What's it cost?

01:06.275 --> 01:09.236
-A cup of coffee?
-Thank you, but, um...

01:09.862 --> 01:11.363
I already have a load in downstairs,

01:11.446 --> 01:14.658
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.744
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

01:17.828 --> 01:21.206
-Ah, well, I'll keep my distance.
-Hopefully, not too far.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.752
I think you left your stereo on.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.840
-Oh, right. Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.682
ROGERS: I don't remember giving you a key.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.100
-(GUNSHOT)
-(SCREAMS)

01:40.184 --> 01:42.102
(GRUNTING AND COUGHING)

01:42.186 --> 01:43.312
(DOOR OPENS)

01:44.146 --> 01:46.732
Captain, I'm Agent 13.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Service.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.776
-Kate?
-I'm assigned to protect you.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.486
-On whose order?
-His.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.281
-Captain Rogers.
-Neighbor.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.951
PIERCE: Captain, you were
the last one to see Nick alive.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.245
-Why was he there?
-He told me not to trust anyone.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.501
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:06.919 --> 02:08.629
If S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

02:08.712 --> 02:11.089
a manhunt for Captain America,
we deserve to know why.

02:12.007 --> 02:15.552
PIERCE: Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.845
He refused to share it.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.436
About damn time.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.190
ROGERS: Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.777
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.114
-Alexander Pierce is their leader.
-(MAN SCREAMS)

02:36.198 --> 02:39.409
ROGERS: They shot Nick Fury.
And it won't end there.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.745
Unless we stop them.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.086
(BREATH TREMBLING)

02:52.756 --> 02:54.174
-(THUDS)
-(GASPS)

02:54.842 --> 02:56.176
-(BOTH GRUNT)
-(ALL SCREAM)

02:57.719 --> 02:58.971
(BOTH GRUNTING)

03:11.358 --> 03:13.235
You were meant for more than this.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.666
SHARON: Margaret Carter was known
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D.,

03:29.251 --> 03:31.211
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.800
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage

03:36.884 --> 03:40.888
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.765
She said, "Compromise where you can.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.269
Where you can't, don't."

03:47.978 --> 03:50.189
CIA has you stationed over here now?

03:50.272 --> 03:52.608
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.902
(GRUNTS)

03:55.903 --> 04:00.949
SHARON: "Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.036
"Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

04:04.870 --> 04:08.373
"it is your duty
to plant yourself like a tree...

04:08.457 --> 04:10.584
"look them in the eye and say,
'No, you move.'"

04:10.667 --> 04:11.877
Follow me.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.927
-They're gonna come looking for you.
-I know.
