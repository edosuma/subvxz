- I can't believe
I don't remember anything.

21:41.199 --> 21:43.467
- I wish I could show you
the look on your face

21:43.534 --> 21:45.937
when Jack accidentally
sprayed you in the mouth.

21:46.004 --> 21:47.906
It was a disaster.

21:47.972 --> 21:50.507
You were like, "I love him."

21:50.574 --> 21:52.076
[laughter]

21:52.143 --> 21:53.544
"Oh, Jackie."

21:53.611 --> 21:55.780
And I was like, no!

21:55.846 --> 21:57.749
- Oh, no.

21:57.815 --> 21:59.384
- Mia was devastated.

21:59.451 --> 22:00.918
- I feel so bad.

22:00.985 --> 22:03.021
She's not my favorite,
but I don't want

22:03.087 --> 22:04.689
to hurt her like that.

22:04.755 --> 22:06.825
- We totally have
to make it up to her.

22:06.891 --> 22:08.592
But the good news is,

22:08.659 --> 22:10.494
I think I'm getting better
with my magic.

22:10.561 --> 22:11.595
No one barfed.

22:11.662 --> 22:13.297
And only two people
were affected,

22:13.364 --> 22:15.099
and only half
of those two people were wrong.

22:15.166 --> 22:17.135
So I'm at, like,
a 50% success rate,

22:17.201 --> 22:18.436
which is good enough for me.

22:18.502 --> 22:20.304
- And he won't remember
anything either?

22:20.371 --> 22:21.172
- Right.

22:21.239 --> 22:22.974
Oh, and we're partners.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.341
I panicked
when you were glued to Jack.

22:24.408 --> 22:26.110
But I think it'll be cool
to have two girls.

22:26.177 --> 22:27.612
- Totally.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.214
Weren't any first-class
matchups for us anyway.

22:30.281 --> 22:34.952
- I needed a Taurus,
which none of the boys are.

22:35.019 --> 22:36.955
- I'm a Taurus moon.

22:37.021 --> 22:38.723
- How did I not catch that?

22:38.789 --> 22:41.158
And now that I think of it,

22:41.225 --> 22:42.760
you're a Taurus rising as well.

22:42.826 --> 22:44.362
- Mm-hmm.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.830
- We really might be
a dance match made in heaven.

I missed the deadline
