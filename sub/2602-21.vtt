WEBVTT

00:03.805 --> 00:05.773
Whoa. What's with the cast?
I sprained my wrist.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.107
Oh, no!
What happened?

00:07.142 --> 00:08.809
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.

00:08.843 --> 00:09.977
Yeah! Geez, Amy.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.011
<i>Back off.</i>

00:11.045 --> 00:12.279
Leave the guy alone.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.560
All right, huddle up, everybody.

00:13.581 --> 00:14.815
<i>Bring it in, bring it in!</i>

00:14.816 --> 00:16.149
<i>So he wouldn't say what happened,</i>

00:16.184 --> 00:17.651
which can only mean one thing.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.920
- He's in a fight club.
<i>- No.</i>

00:19.954 --> 00:22.856
He did it doing something he's
embarrassed by, like smiling.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.358
Only question is, how do you
hurt your arm smiling?

00:24.359 --> 00:25.659
<i>Could be a sports injury.</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:28.295
I sprained my wrist in college
playing field hockey.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.764
Men's field hockey?
Yeah.

00:30.799 --> 00:32.499
It's much more violent
than the women's game.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.102
We're not allowed to wear anything
that protects our breasts.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.804
Attention, everyone,
I can hear you speculating

00:36.838 --> 00:39.807
about the nature and origin
of my injury from my office.

00:39.808 --> 00:42.609
I tripped over an uneven sidewalk.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.578
<i>I did not think
it was relevant to your jobs,</i>

00:44.579 --> 00:48.115
the jobs which you should all
be doing right now.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.716
<i>Get to work.</i>

00:52.520 --> 00:55.555
Do you wanna know
how I actually hurt my wrist?

00:55.590 --> 00:57.390
Yes.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.059
I was hula-hooping.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.395
Kevin and I attend a class
for fitness and for fun.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.430
Oh, my God.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.399
I've mastered all the moves.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.534
The pizza toss...

01:07.535 --> 01:08.702
The tornado...

01:08.703 --> 01:11.938
The scorpion, the oopsie doodle.

01:11.973 --> 01:15.208
Why are you telling me this?

01:15.209 --> 01:18.378
Because no one...
Will ever believe you.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.080
<i>No. No!</i>

01:23.117 --> 01:25.419
You sick son of a bitch.

Hey, hey!

01:46.808 --> 01:49.816
What has three thumbs
and just made another arrest?

01:49.844 --> 01:51.745
This guy!

01:51.746 --> 01:53.780
It doesn't work if you don't
put your thumb up.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.948
Thank you!

01:54.982 --> 01:57.584
23 solves in one month.
New precinct record!

01:57.585 --> 01:58.985
Yeah!

01:59.020 --> 02:00.420
Thank you, thanks.

02:00.455 --> 02:01.788
Dance with me, Jakey.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.625
Ha! No, and I will never dance
to that song.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.594
Wait to go, Jakey!
Whoa!

02:07.628 --> 02:10.297
Are those thumbtacks?
What the hell, Scully?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.771
I thought they'd make good confetti.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.400
Why?

02:13.401 --> 02:15.202
This took a lot of hard work
and a lot of late nights.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.703
Take the weekend off, Peralta.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.804
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:17.839 --> 02:19.406
You know, I actually might.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.775
I'm severely sleep-deprived
and I'm way behind on laundry.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.643
Good work.
Oh.

02:23.678 --> 02:25.545
That's nice.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.780
Hey!

02:26.814 --> 02:28.048
What's with the bag?

02:28.049 --> 02:30.584
Are you going on a cruise
with your mom... in 1913?

02:30.585 --> 02:32.519
This is a very stylish bag.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.388
<i>Teddy and I are going to
the Berkshires for the weekend.</i>

02:34.389 --> 02:36.390
Oh, for like a police conference?

02:36.391 --> 02:38.225
Nope, just a romantic getaway.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.793
Wow!

02:39.794 --> 02:41.995
That's great.
I know.

02:42.029 --> 02:45.065
We're kind of taking things
to the next level.

02:45.099 --> 02:46.333
What are you doing this weekend?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.435
Oh, opposite of the Berkshires.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.971
Work-shires.
Working, whole weekend.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.439
Fighting crime.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.174
I thought you were taking
the weekend off to do your laundry.

02:54.208 --> 02:58.245
Does crime take the weekend off
to do its laundry, Scully?

02:58.246 --> 03:01.181
No, it doesn't.
Sorry.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.118
Can I call you back?
Bye.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.220
What's up?
Looking for paper towels.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.056
What are you doing in here?
Talking to Vivian.

03:09.057 --> 03:11.758
We're still trying to figure out
whether we should move to Canada.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.160
It's awful!

03:13.161 --> 03:15.195
Thank God it hasn't affected
how much we bathe together.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.229
Almost never?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.397
All the time.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.699
<i>Thing is it's so hard to talk at work</i>

03:18.700 --> 03:19.800
<i>because there's no privacy.</i>

03:19.834 --> 03:22.869
The roof is freezing, the
holding cell is full of perps,

03:22.904 --> 03:24.805
and their romantic advice is not great.

03:24.806 --> 03:28.008
It's always to tell Vivian,
"bitch, get your life right!"

03:28.042 --> 03:30.544
<i>I tried it.
She did not like it.</i>

03:30.545 --> 03:32.145
Let me work on it.

03:38.786 --> 03:39.986
Hands up, cop.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.421
Hey... no, no.
Oh, no, no!

03:41.422 --> 03:42.689
It's Teddy, your boyfriend!

03:42.724 --> 03:44.958
Aww, boyfriend.
Yeah.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.493
Can you release my arm?

03:46.494 --> 03:47.761
Oh, yeah!
Sorry.

03:47.762 --> 03:48.929
Good one.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.097
Thanks.

03:50.098 --> 03:51.498
What are you doing here?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.633
Oh, I just wanted to see you
before we left for the weekend.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.435
<i>Aw, that's so gross.</i>

03:55.436 --> 03:56.860
What's this weekend?

03:56.871 --> 03:58.372
We rented a cabin in the Berkshires.

03:58.373 --> 04:00.273
We're taking a couples cooking class,

04:00.274 --> 04:01.865
and there's this great antiques fair.

04:01.876 --> 04:05.679
Sounds like you two have a wonderful
lesbian vacation planned.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.849
<i>Now my question is,</i> will you
be back tomorrow afternoon?

04:08.850 --> 04:10.384
Because that is when you promised Holt

04:10.385 --> 04:12.886
you'd help with
his community outreach meeting.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.488
That's this weekend?

04:14.522 --> 04:16.322
I totally forgot.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.158
How did I let the Captain
talk me into that?

04:18.192 --> 04:19.259
Excuse me, everyone.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.260
Would one of you be willing to...

04:20.293 --> 04:21.495
Me! I'll do it!

04:21.495 --> 04:23.178
I volunteer all my time.

04:23.197 --> 04:25.599
Crap.
What am I gonna do?

04:25.600 --> 04:28.168
Well, it's okay.
We can reschedule.

04:28.169 --> 04:30.270
I mean, we'll lose the deposit, but...

04:30.304 --> 04:33.006
Or you could just lie to Captain Holt.

04:33.007 --> 04:36.777
That's my policy for everything
and it always works.

04:36.811 --> 04:38.145
I'm not gonna lie.

04:38.146 --> 04:41.481
I'll just tell the Captain I made
a mistake, and he'll understand.

04:41.516 --> 04:42.682
Kay.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.485
But if you do lie, you can't go
wrong with dental emergency.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.320
Or death of a triplet.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.122
Now that one you can use twice.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.857
Smart.

04:50.892 --> 04:52.292
Good news, sergeant.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.668
I figured out what we're
gonna work on this weekend.

04:54.696 --> 04:56.930
I'm working on spending time
with my family.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.832
We're having a fancy tea party.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.534
I am the King of origami napkins.

05:00.535 --> 05:01.802
Oh, that's nice.

05:01.803 --> 05:03.136
I thought you were taking the weekend off.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.972
No, I decided to spend the weekend
taking things to the next level.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.347
Work-wise.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.409
I found a cold case of ours
that everyone foolishly said

05:09.410 --> 05:11.478
was unsolvable.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.114
Case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ.

05:14.148 --> 05:17.250
Jake, case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ
<i>is</i> unsolvable.

05:17.251 --> 05:23.123
Or maybe case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ is
waiting for someone to de-unsolve it.

05:23.124 --> 05:25.992
What's case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ?

05:25.993 --> 05:29.029
Case 52ABX... we gotta find a way
to abbreviate this thing.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.098
Anyway, it's an old case
that the sarge and I worked

05:31.132 --> 05:32.466
about eight years ago.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.634
This guy Nate Dexter was
murdered in a boat explosion.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.170
No witnesses, no leads, minimal evidence.

05:37.205 --> 05:38.572
This case almost killed us.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.806
Yeah, but I'm on a hot streak!

05:39.807 --> 05:41.775
Plus we're better detectives now.

05:41.776 --> 05:45.412
We're smarter, computers are
faster, no more blockbuster.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.381
Drones?

05:47.382 --> 05:49.716
I'm feeling it.

05:49.751 --> 05:51.718
That was creepy.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.186
But... convincing.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.821
Oh, he's standing up.

05:54.856 --> 05:56.390
I've always wanted to solve that case.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.392
Then think about how good
it would feel to finally do it.

05:58.393 --> 05:59.526
What's the best moment of your life?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.194
My wedding day.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.829
Tied with the day my babies were born.

06:02.864 --> 06:06.400
Compared to this,
those memories will be garbage.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.168
You don't know what you're saying.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.337
'Cause I'm not married
and I don't have kids. Right?

06:10.371 --> 06:11.953
Okay.

06:13.969 --> 06:15.170
Okay, here's what we know.

06:15.471 --> 06:18.373
Nate Dexter was a small-time
crook who pissed someone off.

06:18.474 --> 06:19.974
They blew up his boat,
with him still on it,

06:19.975 --> 06:22.643
and left no evidence
except this one charred finger

06:22.644 --> 06:24.245
and Nate's melted torso.

06:24.246 --> 06:25.980
Man, I'm having deja vu right now.

06:25.981 --> 06:28.816
Whoever did it left no evidence,
<i>except one charred finger</i>

06:28.851 --> 06:31.085
and Nate's melted torso.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.521
So in other words nothing's changed.

06:33.555 --> 06:34.722
Except our attitudes.

06:34.757 --> 06:37.158
So! We start at the last place

06:37.192 --> 06:38.793
that Dexter was seen
before he went to the marina...

06:38.794 --> 06:40.328
His apartment.

06:40.329 --> 06:43.398
I'm telling you, sarge,
I got a good feeling about this.

06:43.432 --> 06:46.734
Aw, no!

06:46.769 --> 06:49.036
Well, it appears
his building was torn down.

06:49.071 --> 06:52.173
I know this seems like bad
news, but on the plus side

06:52.174 --> 06:55.176
the harder the solve the sweeter the solve.

06:55.210 --> 06:56.611
No, it's just bad news.

06:56.645 --> 06:57.678
You're bad news.

06:57.713 --> 06:59.046
What?
What?

06:59.047 --> 07:01.449
Just saying you're bad news for bad guys,

07:01.450 --> 07:04.685
'cause you're a number-one cop.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.721
Blacker the Berry the sweeter the juice!

07:06.755 --> 07:08.122
What?
What?

07:08.123 --> 07:09.690
Let's solve the case!

07:09.725 --> 07:11.426
<i>Hey!</i>

07:11.460 --> 07:13.061
We need to tell Charles about Babylon.

07:13.095 --> 07:15.096
He needs a private place to talk to Vivian.

07:15.097 --> 07:18.232
What? No!
Babylon's our secret place.

07:18.233 --> 07:21.636
It's the best thing in my life,
and I have a very full life.

07:21.637 --> 07:24.739
Do you know I know Papa John?
<i>The</i> Papa John.

07:24.773 --> 07:25.973
Someone is lying to you.

07:25.974 --> 07:27.208
<i>We can't tell Charles.</i>

07:27.209 --> 07:29.243
He's incapable of keeping a secret.

07:29.244 --> 07:30.745
I shouldn't tell you this,

07:30.746 --> 07:34.148
but we're throwing you
a surprise party later!

07:34.149 --> 07:36.150
Look, we tell Charles about Babylon,

07:36.151 --> 07:38.186
or I shred your nap blanket
into a million tiny rags.

07:38.220 --> 07:41.489
No! I love wolfie.
Fine! You win!

07:41.490 --> 07:43.291
Tell Charles.

07:43.325 --> 07:45.293
Hold me close, little wolfie.

07:45.294 --> 07:46.694
Hold me.

07:46.729 --> 07:49.097
All right, convict.

07:49.098 --> 07:51.632
What do you know
about the murder of Nate Dexter?

07:51.667 --> 07:53.801
Look, I'll tell you the same thing...

07:53.836 --> 07:55.289
I told you eight years ago.

07:55.304 --> 07:57.004
I don't know anything about Nate Dexter.

07:57.039 --> 07:58.172
And even if I did...

07:58.207 --> 07:59.941
The best French toast I ever ate

07:59.942 --> 08:01.743
was with mayor Lindsay's dog.

08:01.744 --> 08:05.213
He's very old, he's lost his mind.

08:07.015 --> 08:08.969
We're making progress!

08:08.984 --> 08:11.285
Hello, Captain, my old friend.

08:11.286 --> 08:12.820
I've come to talk with you...

08:12.855 --> 08:14.122
Again.

08:14.123 --> 08:15.490
I've lapsed into song lyrics.

08:15.524 --> 08:16.758
Santiago, can I help you?

08:16.792 --> 08:19.394
I need to speak with you
about this weekend.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.895
Yes, I'm so happy you'll be there

08:20.896 --> 08:22.663
to oversee
the audio-visual presentation.

08:22.664 --> 08:25.266
The last time did not...
Go well.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.068
The next chart shows
the drop in the crime rate

08:27.069 --> 08:29.637
over the last month.

08:31.874 --> 08:35.076
I just erased everything.

08:35.077 --> 08:39.147
I'm so sorry, but I think I'm gonna
be unable to help out tomorrow.

08:39.181 --> 08:41.315
Why is that?

08:41.316 --> 08:42.817
Dental emergency.

08:42.818 --> 08:45.620
I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled.

08:45.654 --> 08:47.321
Wow, you must be in a lotta pain.

08:47.322 --> 08:49.257
Yeah, I've been in pain for days.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.092
I had no idea you were living like this.

08:51.093 --> 08:52.193
No one knows.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.796
I am a rock.
I am an island.

08:54.797 --> 08:56.798
I have lapsed into song lyrics again.

08:56.799 --> 08:58.132
Okay.

08:59.601 --> 09:00.968
That's all of 'em.

09:01.003 --> 09:03.037
What? What about to Frank Williams?

09:03.072 --> 09:04.305
He's in the infirmary.

09:04.306 --> 09:07.175
He was beat up pretty good,
a lot of internal bleeding.

09:07.209 --> 09:08.576
Awesome!

09:08.610 --> 09:10.111
I mean, not the internal bleeding thing.

09:10.112 --> 09:11.446
That sounds horrifying.

09:11.447 --> 09:12.780
But I bet you we can get him to talk

09:12.781 --> 09:14.282
if we offer to move him
from his current address

09:14.283 --> 09:15.717
on beatdown boulevard.

09:15.751 --> 09:18.519
That's a great idea.
Looks like we got lucky.

09:18.554 --> 09:19.854
<i>Hey, side note...</i>

09:19.888 --> 09:21.055
"Beatdown boulevard,"

09:21.056 --> 09:22.457
good name for my debut hip-hop record.

09:22.491 --> 09:24.559
Strongly disagree.
Okay.

09:24.593 --> 09:26.794
Will you just tell me where we're going?

09:26.795 --> 09:29.731
Guys? Guys!

09:29.732 --> 09:31.866
Oh, my God, you're gonna beat me up.

09:34.236 --> 09:36.838
Welcome to Babylon!

09:36.839 --> 09:38.973
<i>It's our secret bathroom.</i>

09:38.974 --> 09:40.808
It's so beautiful.

09:40.809 --> 09:42.677
There used to be a transit
police squad down here.

09:42.711 --> 09:45.546
This was a Captain's bathroom.
I found it a while back.

09:45.581 --> 09:47.382
She told me about it a year ago

09:47.416 --> 09:48.950
when I got stomach flu
from that sewer rave.

09:48.951 --> 09:50.585
Fun night though.

09:50.619 --> 09:53.087
<i>We put a lotta effort
into making this place nice.</i>

09:53.122 --> 09:54.655
Look.

09:54.656 --> 09:55.890
Weird crystals.

09:56.992 --> 09:58.493
Also, lavender-scented candles,

09:58.527 --> 10:03.031
a zebra-skin rug, and the toilet
paper is, triple-ply.

10:03.065 --> 10:04.298
Wow.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.134
It turns anyone's bottom into a VIP.

10:06.135 --> 10:07.402
More importantly...

10:07.403 --> 10:08.770
<i>It has great cell service.</i>

10:08.804 --> 10:11.406
We thought you could use this place
to call Vivian when you need to.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.375
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone about this.

10:14.410 --> 10:15.910
I pinky promise.

10:15.911 --> 10:17.912
Not good enough.

10:17.913 --> 10:19.947
Blood pact!

10:19.982 --> 10:21.749
All right, Frank, let's recap, shall we?

10:21.750 --> 10:24.452
You slipped and fell onto a shiv.

10:24.486 --> 10:27.689
Then you got up and fell
backwards onto another shiv.

10:27.690 --> 10:31.426
And finally one last shiv fell from
the ceiling and into your body.

10:31.427 --> 10:32.760
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

10:32.761 --> 10:34.128
I think you got shivved.

10:34.163 --> 10:35.530
What do you guys want?

10:35.531 --> 10:36.731
We wanna make a deal.

10:36.765 --> 10:38.633
You know anything
about the murder of Nate Dexter?

10:38.634 --> 10:39.767
<i>Maybe.</i>

10:39.802 --> 10:41.736
What do I get if I do?

10:41.770 --> 10:43.237
How about a transfer to another cell block?

10:43.238 --> 10:44.706
One with fewer shivs.

10:44.707 --> 10:45.907
<i>Okay.</i>

10:45.941 --> 10:47.842
I can't be sure,

10:47.843 --> 10:51.079
but I think Dexter owed money
to a guy named Sam Bunsen.

10:51.113 --> 10:52.947
And... that's a new lead!

10:52.948 --> 10:55.049
First lead in eight years.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.317
You were right.

10:56.318 --> 10:58.786
♪ Beatdown boulevard ♪

10:58.787 --> 11:00.154
♪ Is the toughest street in town ♪

11:00.155 --> 11:01.289
No, no.

11:01.290 --> 11:03.291
♪ And if you step to a gangsta crew ♪

11:03.292 --> 11:04.826
♪ You're bound to get beat down ♪

11:04.827 --> 11:05.927
♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha ♪

11:05.961 --> 11:07.929
Santiago.
How are your teeth feeling?

11:07.963 --> 11:09.464
<i>Oh.</i>

11:09.498 --> 11:10.732
Dental emergency?

11:10.766 --> 11:12.700
Yes, it just sorta happened.

11:12.735 --> 11:16.104
It still hurts, but I can
make it till tomorrow.

11:16.105 --> 11:18.673
Well, if you're in this much pain,
I don't think you should wait.

11:18.674 --> 11:19.974
My brother-in-law is
one of the top oral surgeons

11:19.975 --> 11:21.109
in the quint-state area.

11:21.143 --> 11:23.478
That's two better
than the tri-state area.

11:23.479 --> 11:24.946
He's agreed to see you tonight at 6:00

11:24.947 --> 11:27.015
as a personal favor to me and Kevin.

11:27.049 --> 11:29.283
Wow! Tonight!

11:29.318 --> 11:30.785
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:30.819 --> 11:33.454
But that's not gonna work...

11:33.455 --> 11:35.156
Because of the anesthesia

11:35.190 --> 11:36.591
<i>and driving myself home.</i>

11:36.625 --> 11:38.926
I'll just go tomorrow.
Teddy can take me.

11:38.927 --> 11:40.428
Nonsense.

11:40.429 --> 11:43.031
I'll drive you to and from
the dentist's office myself.

11:43.032 --> 11:47.568
That's great, just great.

11:47.569 --> 11:49.137
<i>He's a good dude.</i>

11:49.138 --> 11:51.839
He's a good, good dude.

11:51.874 --> 11:53.474
Hey, sarge.

11:53.509 --> 11:55.576
No sign of Sam Bunsen
in the federal database.

11:55.611 --> 11:57.211
You got anything?
Bad news.

11:57.212 --> 11:59.881
I only found his wife and she hasn't
heard from him in eight years.

11:59.915 --> 12:01.616
That doesn't sound good.
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:01.650 --> 12:03.885
That's why I started
by saying "bad news."

12:03.886 --> 12:06.220
Terry believes in having
a clear topic sentence.

12:06.255 --> 12:09.057
I bet Mrs. Bunsen is lying.
She knows where her husband is.

12:09.091 --> 12:10.792
I pushed pretty hard.

12:10.793 --> 12:12.493
She said she's willing
to take a lie detector test.

12:12.528 --> 12:14.329
Well, then let's bust out the polygraph.

12:14.330 --> 12:16.130
Lie detector truth or dare!

12:16.131 --> 12:17.532
No. Boyle, last time we did that,

12:17.533 --> 12:19.300
you ended up telling everyone
you had a crush on the teapot

12:19.301 --> 12:20.702
from <i> Beauty and the Beast.</i>

12:20.736 --> 12:22.637
It's the way they drew her.

12:28.396 --> 12:29.796
All right, pretty boy, where is it?

12:29.821 --> 12:31.388
Where's what?

12:31.423 --> 12:32.422
The secret bathroom.

12:32.424 --> 12:35.226
Secret what?
Bathroom where?

12:35.227 --> 12:36.660
Okay, Captain, I'll be right there!

12:36.695 --> 12:38.529
Don't lie to us.

12:38.530 --> 12:40.131
We've been watching you.

12:40.132 --> 12:44.668
11:18 A.M., Rosa told you to follow
her, and you guys left together.

12:44.669 --> 12:48.239
You returned at 11:31
smelling of lavender.

12:49.608 --> 12:52.743
And you've been drinking
chamomile tea all day long

12:52.744 --> 12:54.678
and haven't been to the men's room once.

12:54.713 --> 12:57.248
Since when are you two
so into being good detectives?

12:57.282 --> 12:58.816
Since it came to secret bathrooms.

12:58.850 --> 13:00.284
Tell us where it is!

13:00.318 --> 13:02.086
<i>Now!</i>

13:02.120 --> 13:04.655
Okay! Please state
your name one more time.

13:04.689 --> 13:06.524
Are we really doing this again?

13:06.525 --> 13:07.925
It's, like, the fifth time.

13:07.959 --> 13:10.428
That's a lie!
It's only the fourth time!

13:10.462 --> 13:11.762
<i>No?</i>

13:11.763 --> 13:13.464
Okay, my bad.
Continue.

13:13.498 --> 13:17.902
I'm Sophia Bunsen, I haven't talked
to my husband in eight years.

13:17.903 --> 13:21.205
This is Nate Dexter.
He was friends with my husband.

13:21.239 --> 13:23.174
I didn't know he was dead.

13:23.175 --> 13:27.178
You think my husband killed him,
but I guarantee that's impossible.

13:27.713 --> 13:30.014
Okay.
Good.

13:30.015 --> 13:32.049
But not good enough!
Let's do it again.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.718
<i>Jake, what's going on with you?</i>

13:33.719 --> 13:35.319
She passed the test like five times.

13:35.354 --> 13:37.922
Or maybe...
She's in cahoots.

13:37.923 --> 13:39.990
With him!

13:40.025 --> 13:41.292
Are you two cahooting?

13:41.326 --> 13:42.593
Are you cahooting?

13:42.594 --> 13:44.161
Jake!
It's over, man.

13:44.162 --> 13:45.529
<i>We had a lead, now it's dead.</i>

13:45.530 --> 13:47.365
It happens!
No.

13:47.366 --> 13:48.933
If it's not her, and it's not him...

13:48.934 --> 13:50.901
Which I'm still not
convinced of, by the way,

13:50.902 --> 13:52.403
then it's gotta be the machine.

13:52.437 --> 13:53.804
Strap me in, sergeant.

13:53.839 --> 13:56.741
I'm taking this thing
for a test drive of truth.

13:57.609 --> 13:59.243
Thanks for taking us, Marty.

13:59.244 --> 14:00.811
Please, Ray, we're family.

14:02.881 --> 14:04.482
Neither of us can understand you at all.

14:05.517 --> 14:08.185
The visual examination
doesn't show much inflammation,

14:08.220 --> 14:10.454
but these x-rays should be more telling.

14:10.455 --> 14:12.790
Let's see what's beneath the surface.

14:12.791 --> 14:13.991
Oh, stop!

14:14.026 --> 14:15.526
Santiago.

14:15.527 --> 14:17.261
I...

14:17.262 --> 14:18.996
Oh, God.

14:18.997 --> 14:21.032
I forgot I promised to help you,

14:21.033 --> 14:23.434
and I made plans to go to the
Berkshires with my boyfriend.

14:23.468 --> 14:24.468
Oh.

14:24.469 --> 14:26.771
Wait.

14:26.772 --> 14:30.608
So you lied to me to get out of work?

14:30.609 --> 14:31.842
Yes.

14:31.877 --> 14:34.979
I may be a liar, but I've got great teeth.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.914
And no one can take that from me.

14:36.948 --> 14:39.283
Have you heard of "over-brushing?"

14:39.284 --> 14:40.451
Oh, no.

14:40.473 --> 14:42.153
Your aggressive technique has stripped away

14:42.154 --> 14:45.089
the protective enamel and much of your gum.

14:45.123 --> 14:47.792
You have seven cavities.

14:47.826 --> 14:51.762
I have to say...
I feel like you deserve this.

14:51.797 --> 14:54.098
Charles!

14:54.099 --> 14:55.566
What the hell is wrong with you?

14:55.567 --> 14:57.068
You told Hitchcock and Scully?

14:58.136 --> 14:59.537
No! What?

14:59.571 --> 15:02.306
Yep, this... is... happening.

15:02.307 --> 15:03.774
They were scary.

15:03.775 --> 15:05.409
It was like that moment in <i>Planet of Apes</i>

15:05.410 --> 15:06.644
when the monkey talked.

15:06.678 --> 15:08.379
<i>Look, I'm sorry.</i>

15:08.413 --> 15:09.813
You let me into your special place.

15:09.815 --> 15:12.249
Ew.
I messed up, and I'll fix it.

15:12.284 --> 15:13.584
It's okay, Charles, you don't have to.

15:13.585 --> 15:17.121
No! It's not okay.
Babylon hath fallen.

15:17.122 --> 15:19.957
Charles betrayed us
and I will make him pay for it.

15:19.958 --> 15:21.058
<i>Gina, enough.</i>

15:21.093 --> 15:22.827
Boyle needed a bathroom,
so we told him about it.

15:22.828 --> 15:24.762
Just like I told you when you needed it?

15:24.763 --> 15:26.230
Leave him alone.
He saved my life.

15:26.264 --> 15:27.765
<i>Plus... he's pitiful.</i>

15:27.799 --> 15:29.133
And his life is crap right now.

15:29.167 --> 15:32.937
Yeah! It is!
Thank you, Rosa.

15:32.971 --> 15:35.172
I'm telling you this machine is broken.

15:35.173 --> 15:36.507
Ask me a question.

15:36.508 --> 15:38.476
Is Jay Z really your favorite artist?

15:38.510 --> 15:39.643
Yes, obviously.

15:39.678 --> 15:41.412
Lie.

15:41.446 --> 15:43.214
See? It's busted.
Is it?

15:43.215 --> 15:45.349
Or is your favorite artist
really Taylor Swift?

15:45.384 --> 15:47.451
No.

15:47.486 --> 15:48.953
Lie.
All right, fine.

15:48.987 --> 15:50.821
She is.

15:50.822 --> 15:52.356
She makes me feel things.

15:52.391 --> 15:55.059
She makes me all of us feel things!

15:55.060 --> 15:57.995
Look, that machine is working just fine.

15:57.996 --> 16:00.097
Why are you being so crazy about this case?

16:00.132 --> 16:02.033
I wanted to work the toughest case we had.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.501
Why?

16:03.535 --> 16:04.835
Because it would feel awesome to solve it.

16:04.836 --> 16:06.604
Because a real man
doesn't run from a challenge.

16:06.605 --> 16:08.873
I mean, do they run
from the bulls in Pamplona?

16:08.907 --> 16:10.941
Yeah. That's the whole point of it.

16:10.976 --> 16:13.210
Seriously?
That seems lame.

16:13.245 --> 16:15.479
I don't know why you wanna spend
the entire weekend at work,

16:15.480 --> 16:16.814
but I'm going home to my family.

16:16.848 --> 16:18.816
See you tomorrow, Jake.

16:18.850 --> 16:20.685
Fine, abandon me!

16:20.719 --> 16:22.620
I don't want you here anyway.

16:22.621 --> 16:23.688
That's a lie.

16:23.722 --> 16:25.623
Come on, man.

16:27.492 --> 16:29.293
I got here an hour early.
This better be good.

16:29.328 --> 16:31.228
Holy Moses!

16:31.229 --> 16:32.630
What happened to you?

16:32.631 --> 16:35.800
<i>I have not slept in, since I
last saw you,</i> many hours.

16:35.801 --> 16:37.301
Plus, I think I'm hallucinating

16:37.302 --> 16:40.037
because I'm pretty sure I just
heard your biceps mocking me.

16:40.038 --> 16:41.739
No, that's possible.

16:41.740 --> 16:43.908
My biceps mock a lotta people.

16:43.942 --> 16:45.142
Good to know.

16:45.143 --> 16:48.679
So I rewatched the
interrogation, and get this.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.581
Sophia wasn't lying about anything.

16:50.615 --> 16:52.249
She doesn't know who killed Nate Dexter.

16:52.250 --> 16:56.320
But... she does know
something way better.

16:56.321 --> 17:00.057
Come with me.

17:00.993 --> 17:02.827
Jake!

17:02.861 --> 17:04.228
People normally move after they say that.

17:04.262 --> 17:06.597
Oh, yeah, I feel asleep for a second.

17:06.598 --> 17:08.332
Sorry.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.101
Come with me.

17:12.202 --> 17:13.602
Okay!

17:13.762 --> 17:15.604
Y'all ready for this?
You know what I'm saying?

17:15.605 --> 17:19.141
Terry Jeffords,
allow me to introduce to you...

17:19.142 --> 17:23.578
Our murder victim,
the not-dead Nate Dexter.

17:23.579 --> 17:25.247
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

17:25.248 --> 17:27.214
Right?

17:27.250 --> 17:28.583
Sophia wasn't lying.

17:28.584 --> 17:30.152
I was just not asking the right questions.

17:30.186 --> 17:31.866
She hadn't seen her husband in eight years,

17:31.888 --> 17:34.656
but she was positive there's
no way that he killed Dexter.

17:34.657 --> 17:37.659
That's when it occurred to me,
no one killed him.

17:37.660 --> 17:40.162
Hey, Nate, just talking
about how you're alive.

17:40.163 --> 17:42.230
Yeah, I'm alive.

17:42.265 --> 17:44.232
But whose melted torso did we find?

17:46.602 --> 17:48.103
Sophia's husband.

17:48.137 --> 17:49.304
Yes!

17:49.305 --> 17:51.373
Sophia and Dexter were having an affair,

17:51.374 --> 17:53.842
husband found out, Nate killed him.

17:53.843 --> 17:55.844
Now I'm telling my friend
about how you killed that guy.

17:55.878 --> 17:57.379
It was for love!

17:57.413 --> 17:58.980
Cool motive, still a murder.

17:58.981 --> 18:00.982
Also, you remember that severed finger?

18:00.983 --> 18:02.551
Check this out.
Hey, Nate.

18:02.585 --> 18:04.953
<i>Show us your hands, please?</i>

18:04.954 --> 18:06.988
<i>Ho-ho!
Right?</i>

18:06.989 --> 18:09.758
Cut it off himself.
How screwed up is that?

18:09.792 --> 18:12.160
Anyway, I asked all of my CIs
if they had dealings

18:12.161 --> 18:13.495
with a nine-fingered man.

18:13.496 --> 18:16.031
Unsolvable case...
Solved!

18:16.032 --> 18:17.232
Whoo!

18:17.266 --> 18:19.935
What'd you wanna talk to us about?

18:19.969 --> 18:21.636
Well, I got Hitchcock and Scully

18:21.637 --> 18:23.805
to promise never to use our bathroom again.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.240
How'd you do that?

18:25.274 --> 18:27.642
The Donald and I call it
"the art of the deal."

18:27.677 --> 18:29.344
You want your bathroom back, fine.

18:29.345 --> 18:31.079
I want your chair.
Mine smells like my butt.

18:31.114 --> 18:32.114
Ew! Fine.

18:32.148 --> 18:33.582
And we want your coyote blanket.

18:33.616 --> 18:35.283
It's not a coyote, it's a wolf.

18:35.284 --> 18:36.985
Learn your animals, idiot.

18:37.019 --> 18:38.253
Told you she wasn't serious.

18:38.254 --> 18:39.821
Let's go, Scully.

18:39.856 --> 18:41.056
Fine!

18:41.090 --> 18:42.657
I can't believe you gave up wolfie.

18:42.658 --> 18:43.759
<i>It was worth it.</i>

18:43.793 --> 18:46.428
Plus, I'm done with wolves now.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.130
I'm into angry unicorns.

18:49.632 --> 18:52.401
If I was a unicorn, I'd never be angry.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.935
Jake!

18:53.970 --> 18:55.504
Nice job on the case.
Great solve!

18:55.538 --> 18:57.672
Thanks. Aren't you supposed
to be in the Berkshires?

18:57.707 --> 18:59.474
I had a dental thing.

18:59.509 --> 19:00.609
But you're such a good brusher.

19:00.643 --> 19:01.977
I know!

19:01.978 --> 19:03.378
Turns out that was my undoing.

19:03.379 --> 19:05.047
Classic.
Yeah.

19:05.048 --> 19:06.415
Hey, you remember Teddy.

19:06.416 --> 19:07.749
Oh! Yeah. Hey, man.
How are you?

19:07.750 --> 19:09.051
<i>Great solve.</i>

19:09.052 --> 19:10.819
Can I buy you a Pilsner?
They have awesome Pilsners here.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.187
Teddy's really into Pilsners.

19:12.188 --> 19:13.422
Cool!

19:13.423 --> 19:14.723
Attention!

19:14.724 --> 19:19.528
Everyone raise your glasses
to the amazing Jake Peralta!

19:19.529 --> 19:21.930
<i>Today, he did the impossible.</i>

19:21.964 --> 19:25.534
He closed case 52abx-dash-32qj.

19:27.370 --> 19:29.137
Speech, speech, speech!

19:29.172 --> 19:31.373
Look, the real hero here is the murderer.

19:31.407 --> 19:32.974
Because without him
there wouldn't be a case.

19:33.009 --> 19:36.211
So... here's to Nate Dexter,
the murderer.

19:41.250 --> 19:45.420
Captain... I wanna
apologize for lying.

19:45.454 --> 19:47.722
Thank you.

19:47.723 --> 19:49.424
Next time just talk to me.

19:49.425 --> 19:52.060
Okay.

19:52.061 --> 19:55.296
Now I know this comes
on the heels of betraying you,

19:55.297 --> 19:57.465
but... can I have next weekend off

19:57.466 --> 19:59.601
to go to that cabin
in the Berkshires with Teddy?

20:04.807 --> 20:06.007
Okay.

20:07.176 --> 20:08.776
Thank you, sir.

20:12.815 --> 20:15.884
I still can't feel my mouth.
Did a little bit dribble out?

20:15.918 --> 20:18.253
What's going on with you?

20:18.254 --> 20:19.721
For the past two days,

20:19.722 --> 20:21.422
you've been telling me
how amazing it was gonna be

20:21.423 --> 20:22.790
to solve this case.

20:22.791 --> 20:24.592
This does not look amazing.

20:24.593 --> 20:25.860
I don't know, man.

20:25.861 --> 20:27.795
I thought I'd be more psyched too.

20:27.796 --> 20:30.031
Maybe I just need a cooler case.
No.

20:30.065 --> 20:32.400
That is not gonna work.

20:32.401 --> 20:34.636
You set the precinct record,
you weren't happy.

20:34.670 --> 20:37.939
You solved an unsolvable case,
you weren't happy.

20:37.973 --> 20:39.607
No case is gonna make you happy.

20:40.843 --> 20:42.343
Something's bothering you.

20:42.344 --> 20:45.713
And whatever it is you gotta deal with it.

20:45.714 --> 20:49.317
Yeah, well, maybe I can't
deal with it right now, or...

20:49.318 --> 20:50.785
You know, whatever.

20:50.819 --> 20:54.756
I know!

20:54.757 --> 20:56.391
Oh.

20:56.392 --> 20:57.625
That's a tough one.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.360
Yeah.

20:59.361 --> 21:02.096
But solving more cases isn't
gonna make you feel any better.

21:03.499 --> 21:06.401
Having a drink with a friend might though.

21:06.402 --> 21:10.605
Thank you, but I don't think
another drink is gonna help.

21:10.606 --> 21:12.373
I think having a lot more drinks
might help.

21:12.374 --> 21:15.009
There he is!

21:16.545 --> 21:19.480
So...
Amy?

21:19.481 --> 21:21.115
We're gonna need some shots.

21:22.785 --> 21:25.153
