00:02.293 --> 00:04.295
[breathing in space suit]

00:05.839 --> 00:08.341
[Lana]
<i>So, again, I just want it on record,</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:10.844
<i>I'm 100% against this.</i>

00:10.927 --> 00:13.471
[Pam]
<i>Aw, you're 100% against everything cool!</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:15.348
[Lana] <i>No, I'm not. Shut up.</i>

00:15.432 --> 00:17.976
<i>-Like what?</i>
-[Pam] <i>Um, Ranch Tub?</i>

00:18.059 --> 00:20.812
-[Krieger] <i>Come on, man.</i>
-[Cheryl]<i> Everybody was against Ranch Tub!</i>

00:20.895 --> 00:23.606
Seriously, Pam,
quit trying to make Ranch Tub happen.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.817
[Malory]
<i>Do I even want to know what that is?</i>

00:25.900 --> 00:27.861
Only if you never want to eat ranch again.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.779
-[Malory] <i>I meant "ranch."</i>
-[Lana] <i>What?</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:31.489
-[Malory] <i>That's a food?</i>
-[Lana] <i>It's not important!</i>

00:31.573 --> 00:32.574
I wouldn't go that far.

00:32.657 --> 00:33.658
-Can we please--
-Cyril, shut up.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.743
[Lana]<i> Seriously. Come on.</i>

00:34.826 --> 00:36.411
<i>If we're gonna do this,</i>
<i>let's do it already.</i>

00:36.494 --> 00:37.829
<i>We're sitting ducks</i>
<i>with you two out there.</i>

00:37.912 --> 00:40.373
-Well, whose fault is that?
-[Lana] <i>What? Yours!</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:42.459
<i>You made us stop on the way to Earth</i>
<i>for the damn thing.</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:46.671
Exactly. And everybody remember that
when it's time to divvy it up.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.423
[Malory] <i>Do you think it's worth anything?</i>

00:48.506 --> 00:49.632
Hmm, hard to say.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.680
-I've never seen anything like it.
-So you just jam it with my new pen?

00:55.764 --> 00:58.600
-This is new, this pen right here?
-Yes, as a matter--

00:58.683 --> 01:00.018
Ugh. You know--

01:00.101 --> 01:01.936
[Cheryl] <i>Ooh, maybe it's ambergris.</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:05.607
-How could it be ambergris?
-[Cheryl] <i>If a whale puked it up, duh.</i>

01:05.690 --> 01:06.858
Oh, a space whale?

01:06.941 --> 01:08.860
[Cheryl]
<i>I don't know all the types of whale!</i>

01:08.943 --> 01:12.739
-And yet somehow you know about ambergri--
-[Pam]<i> Oh, maybe it's mithril!</i>

01:12.822 --> 01:14.699
-[Malory]<i> Is that some other food?</i>
-No!

01:14.783 --> 01:17.243
-And it's not mithril!
-[Pam] <i>Just checking.</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:20.371
[Lana] <i>Whatever the hell it is,</i>
<i>just box it up and let's go already!</i>

01:20.455 --> 01:22.040
All right! Jesus!

01:22.123 --> 01:25.210
-So, what do you think, Cyril?
-[sighs] About what?

01:25.293 --> 01:27.921
Is it firm enough to shove in the box?

01:29.130 --> 01:30.548
[chuckles] Nobody?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.343
[Pam] <i>What, like "space phrasing"?</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:35.512
[sighs] No. Never mind.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.892
[theme music playing]

02:15.593 --> 02:17.178
[Geiger counter crackling]

02:17.262 --> 02:21.975
And radiation levels are... normal,
across the spectrum.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.936
[Lana] Well, keep testing.
Radiation's just one danger.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.564
That thing could be carrying
deadly bacteria or some kind of virus.

02:27.647 --> 02:28.648
First of all--

02:28.731 --> 02:30.567
Bacteria and virus are the same thing,
dummy.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.985
-No, they're not.
-Shut up.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.486
-Krieger?
-They are not.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.323
-Oh. Well, what am I thinking of?
-[Malory] Space whores, presumably.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.451
-Well, right, then I was, but--
-Hey, nobody gets out of there

02:40.535 --> 02:42.495
until I'm sure that thing's
not a hazard to the ship,

02:42.579 --> 02:44.164
so the longer you dick around,

02:44.247 --> 02:45.957
the longer you're gonna stay
in quarantine.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.333
-Any questions?
-[doors open]

02:47.417 --> 02:49.377
-[all] What?
-[Pam] Are you doinks done yet?

02:49.460 --> 02:51.462
'Cause I wanna check that crazy thing out.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.797
-Pam!
-What?

02:52.881 --> 02:55.008
You just broke quarantine, dumbass.

02:55.091 --> 02:58.386
So if there's anything deadly on it,
now the entire ship's infected.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.430
[Krieger]
Yeah, but you wouldn't have been.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.223
-What?
-Helmet, genius.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.975
[sighs] Goddamn it.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.810
[warbling]

03:05.894 --> 03:07.645
I'm gonna call him Cubert!

03:09.522 --> 03:11.733
[Krieger] Okay, that was the last test.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.776
And I can confidently say

03:13.860 --> 03:17.238
that the object poses no nuclear,
chemical, or biological threat

03:17.322 --> 03:18.406
to the ship or crew.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.992
[sighs] Not that we could've done
anything about it if it did,

03:21.075 --> 03:22.076
thanks to Pam.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.244
You are welcome.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.621
Hey, can we take a second?

03:24.704 --> 03:29.208
Isn't it crazy that that little scanner
can do all those wildly different tests?

03:29.292 --> 03:32.086
-I mean, come on.
-Yeah, pretty great.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.006
Yes, hooray for everything.
Now, what's it worth?

03:35.089 --> 03:38.051
Well, that I can't say. I don't even know
what elements it's made of.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.261
[chuckles]
Assuming they're even known to us.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.431
-I'll have to do many more tests to--
-Ooh! Here's a test.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.266
Cut the damn thing open and-- [gasps]

03:45.350 --> 03:46.559
-[Krieger] Whoa, hey!
-[Pam] Cool!

03:46.643 --> 03:48.770
Holy shit! It's magnetic!

03:48.853 --> 03:52.315
No, I don't think so. There's metal
all over the place in here, so--

03:52.398 --> 03:54.567
-Oh, my God! Our fillings!
-[Archer scoffs]

03:54.651 --> 03:56.277
-What are you talking about?
-Ugh.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.987
A: fillings are nonferrous, so--

03:58.071 --> 03:59.989
[muffled shouting]

04:01.074 --> 04:04.410
-So--
-[muffled shouting]

04:05.328 --> 04:06.496
So even if it were magnetic--

04:06.579 --> 04:08.498
It's not gonna eat your damn fillings.

04:09.540 --> 04:14.754
[muffled muttering]

04:14.837 --> 04:16.464
But I don't think it is a magnet.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.174
See?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.760
-Well, then how...
-Okay, um--

04:20.843 --> 04:22.428
Pick up another scalpel.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.430
And?

04:24.514 --> 04:26.432
Huh. Well, I had a theory--

04:26.516 --> 04:28.643
[muttering mockingly]

04:28.726 --> 04:30.520
Damn it, woman, if you don't--

04:30.603 --> 04:31.938
-Ah!
-[Lana] Oh, shit.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.022
[Krieger clears throat]

04:33.106 --> 04:35.358
-...that it was reacting to a weapon.
-[gasps]

04:35.441 --> 04:38.278
Then let's kill it! Kill it!
Kill it before--

04:38.361 --> 04:39.404
-[screams]
-[Lana] Whoa!

04:39.487 --> 04:40.780
-Oh, shit.
-Uh...

04:41.114 --> 04:42.115
[Krieger] Hmm.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.033
-Or maybe just aggression.
-What?

04:44.117 --> 04:46.119
Come on,
you're saying it can read our emotions?

04:46.202 --> 04:49.247
-I'm not saying anything... yet.
-[Cheryl thudding]

04:49.998 --> 04:52.125
-How about now?
-Oh, no, sorry.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.877
Need to do a whole big series of tests
before I can--

04:57.547 --> 04:59.882
Huh. Still interrupting.

04:59.966 --> 05:00.967
Typical.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.845
But we should probably... uh...

05:03.928 --> 05:06.222
Carol, come on. Let's get out of there.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.598
[grunting]

05:07.682 --> 05:08.683
Wow. That's--

05:09.559 --> 05:10.768
[straining]

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
-Look, somebody give me a hand here.
-I can help.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.731
-Somebody strong.
-[sighs]

05:14.814 --> 05:16.316
-Ready?
-[both straining]

05:17.650 --> 05:20.945
[panting]
I mean-- I mean, that's crazy, right?

05:21.779 --> 05:24.032
All right! Jesus! I'm doing it!

05:24.115 --> 05:26.159
-Okay, Pam, you're up.
-Mm-kay.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.453
One, two, three, go.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.246
[all straining]

05:30.330 --> 05:31.372
Son of a--

05:31.456 --> 05:33.458
-Go!
-[all straining]

05:35.209 --> 05:37.462
[panting]

05:37.545 --> 05:41.090
-I just thought of something.
-Oh, my God. If you say "Ranch Tub"...

05:41.174 --> 05:45.386
No, shut up.
Look, I can bench, like, 500 kilos, so...

05:45.470 --> 05:48.473
-I can keep pulling on her, but--
-Eventually something's gotta give.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.100
Like her birdy little neck bones.

05:51.184 --> 05:55.146
Because whatever this thing is,
I mean, it's obviously supernatural.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.898
Well, since when is it supernatural?

05:56.981 --> 05:58.483
-Well, it's not a magnet.
-Oh, come on!

05:58.566 --> 06:02.570
So those are our only two options,
ghosts or magnets?

06:02.653 --> 06:04.113
[Cheryl banging]

06:04.197 --> 06:05.364
-I mean--
-Oh, come on!

06:05.448 --> 06:08.367
This is just some bullshit of yours
to put off going back to Earth!

06:08.451 --> 06:09.869
[scoffs] Wh-- What?

06:09.952 --> 06:14.499
So-- So what, Lana, I conjured up
some kind of... telepathic ghost cube?

06:14.582 --> 06:17.126
I didn't say you conjured it up, dickwrap.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.628
I said that--

06:21.214 --> 06:22.924
-Huh.
-[sighs]

06:23.424 --> 06:24.842
Well, I hope you're all--

06:24.926 --> 06:26.177
-[warbling]
-[body thuds]

06:26.260 --> 06:27.512
Jeezy Petes.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.596
...happy.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.640
-Is she breathing?
-No.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.892
-So, she's--
-I mean...

06:32.975 --> 06:35.853
Oh! If only we had access
to some sort of device

06:35.937 --> 06:37.271
which could tell us!

06:38.481 --> 06:39.982
-Krieger!
-What's that?

06:40.066 --> 06:42.360
Oh, right, the scanner! Doi.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.445
Hang on, let me reset it for--

06:44.529 --> 06:46.864
-[gasps]
-[all exclaim]

06:46.948 --> 06:48.366
Are you okay?

06:48.449 --> 06:50.368
[coughing] I think so.

06:50.451 --> 06:54.914
-What was it like? What did you see?
-I don't know, it-- I can't explain it.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.833
-[gasps] Oh, my God!
-What?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.417
-I just remembered.
-Remembered what?

06:58.501 --> 07:00.294
I don't even have fillings!

07:00.378 --> 07:02.755
[laughs]

07:02.839 --> 07:04.841
[warbling]

07:13.516 --> 07:17.019
[Pam] So that whole time you're in there,
you didn't see anything?

07:17.395 --> 07:19.939
[muffled]
No, I mean, it's hard to explain.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.650
It was kind of like I was nothing...

07:22.733 --> 07:23.943
and everything?

07:24.026 --> 07:25.111
If that makes any sense.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.947
About as much as what normally
comes out of your mouth.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.657
And speaking of your mouth...

07:30.950 --> 07:33.244
-What about it?
-You're really packing it away there.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.288
Um, I'm hungry. Sue me.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.708
I will if it turns out you ate all
the priceless filling out of that cube.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.834
Oh, my God.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.753
-[muffled muttering]
-What?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.922
[agitated muttering]

07:45.006 --> 07:46.007
Ugh. Pointless.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.927
-You really think it's worth something?
-It's gotta be. I mean, to somebody.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.971
[Krieger] And whom might that somebody be?

07:52.054 --> 07:54.724
Well, obviously we need
to do some market research,

07:54.807 --> 07:56.392
-but it's--
-It's gone.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.478
-[all] What? Gone?
-[Cheryl choking]

07:59.645 --> 08:00.646
What are you doing?

08:00.730 --> 08:04.066
What's the matter?
Hey, the food ain't that bad, baby.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.986
[coughing, retching]

08:07.069 --> 08:08.738
What's wrong? Are you choking?

08:08.821 --> 08:09.906
Typical.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.324
[Cyril] W-W-What's the matter?

08:11.407 --> 08:12.533
This is serious.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.702
-Get a spoon in her!
-[Pam laughs] Space phrasing!

08:14.785 --> 08:16.037
[clears throat] No.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.747
Plus, that's a collectible!

08:17.830 --> 08:19.582
[coughing]

08:19.665 --> 08:21.834
-Get that spoon in her!
-I'm trying!

08:21.918 --> 08:23.336
[retching]

08:23.419 --> 08:25.421
[guttural howling]

08:28.549 --> 08:29.800
-[coughs]
-[Cyril] Oh, God!

08:29.884 --> 08:30.885
-[Malory] Ugh!
-[Krieger] Gross.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.221
What the shit with the spoon?

08:33.304 --> 08:34.305
-I--
-We thought you were--

08:34.388 --> 08:37.391
What, "She's choking, so let's shove
a goddamn spoon down her throat"?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.227
-Yeah, Cyril.
-Hey! You know what?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.645
I know the stupid cube is gone.

08:40.728 --> 08:41.729
[all] Yeah.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.106
-Yeah, what happened?
-Yeah, what the shit, Krieger?

08:44.190 --> 08:47.443
It was right here on--
well, six inches above the table.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.112
I needed some more sterilizing wipes,
so I--

08:50.196 --> 08:51.989
Why would you need sterilizing wipes?

08:52.073 --> 08:54.242
-I...
-Oh, Krieger, buddy.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.494
Please tell me you didn't try
to have sex with the ghost cube.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.870
-Krieger!
-That's nasty, Krieger!

08:57.954 --> 09:00.998
-No! Of course I didn't!
-We can check the security footage.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.210
-There isn't any. The camera was off.
-Oh, how convenient.

09:04.293 --> 09:07.880
-I did not have sex with the cube!
-Because, first of all, with what?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.632
Oh, okay. Okay.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.968
You wanna make
your stupid little Ken Doll jokes?

09:12.051 --> 09:13.553
Would they be warranted?

09:13.636 --> 09:14.679
-I--
-Focus, people.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.181
There's a million credits' worth
of ghost cube missing.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.225
[chuckles] What happened, Ken?

09:19.308 --> 09:21.686
[sighs] As I was saying...

09:21.769 --> 09:23.563
I needed more sterilizing wipes...

09:23.646 --> 09:26.023
<i>I need more sterilizing wipes.</i> [scatting]

09:26.107 --> 09:27.525
So, I walked out the door,

09:27.608 --> 09:31.529
and after it closed behind me, I keyed in
the alphanumeric code to lock it.

09:31.612 --> 09:36.242
[keypad beeping]

09:36.325 --> 09:40.246
I walked down to the supply room,
got the wipes, and walked back.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.541
I keyed in the code
to unlock the aforementioned door...

09:43.624 --> 09:48.421
[keypad beeping]

09:48.504 --> 09:49.797
[door opens]

09:49.880 --> 09:51.007
I walked in.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.091
<i>What the--</i>

09:52.174 --> 09:54.093
The cube was gone. So...

09:54.635 --> 09:56.345
Obviously one of you took it.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.763
-No, we did not!
-That's bullshit!

09:57.847 --> 09:59.724
Nobody took your new girlfriend.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.184
Yeah, plus,
we were all together in the mess, so--

10:02.268 --> 10:05.521
-So how did it leave a locked room?
-Plenty of ways.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.897
Here, hold this.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.193
All right, let's go find that thing.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.739
And let's all split up.
We can cover a lot more ground that way.

10:14.822 --> 10:18.576
So, individually,
go bumbling around this big ol' spaceship

10:18.659 --> 10:19.702
looking for a ghost.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.912
To bumble or not is up to you,

10:22.371 --> 10:23.539
but whoever finds it...

10:23.873 --> 10:24.874
gets to keep it!

10:24.957 --> 10:26.709
-Wait, what?
-[Malory] Findies keepies!

10:26.792 --> 10:29.128
-Wait a minute, what?
-[Cheryl laughing] "Findies keepies."

10:30.880 --> 10:33.382
-[Cyril] Out of my way!
-[Cheryl] No, no, no! Get out of my way!

10:33.466 --> 10:35.051
-Get out!
-[all groaning]

10:35.134 --> 10:36.636
And bumble it is.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.055
-[Lana] Get out of my way, meathead.
-[Archer] I saw it first!

10:39.138 --> 10:40.431
-[all groan]
-Wait a minute!

10:40.514 --> 10:42.975
Now, look, before you all
go running off half-cocked--

10:43.059 --> 10:45.895
Krieger, we don't have time to pile on you
with a bunch of no-dick jokes.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.438
I knew it right when I said it.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.190
-[Lana] I call bridge!
-[Cyril] Well, I'm coming with you!

10:49.273 --> 10:50.691
-[Lana] No, you're not!
-Uh... Well, then--

10:50.775 --> 10:53.903
-I-I get the crew quarters!
-You better not go in my boudoir!

10:53.986 --> 10:55.321
Okay, I call dibs on the--

10:55.404 --> 10:57.156
-[screams]
-[Pam] Dibs on them ribs, sucka!

10:57.239 --> 10:59.575
Holy shit! That really hurt!

10:59.659 --> 11:01.410
Well, if you think that hurt...

11:02.620 --> 11:04.789
[laughs hysterically]

11:04.872 --> 11:06.332
That's disconcerting.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.625
Yeah, ya think?

11:08.709 --> 11:09.710
Yes.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.296
[Ray] I said no, goddamn it!

11:12.380 --> 11:13.381
[Cyril groaning]

11:13.464 --> 11:14.465
-Get out!
-[Cyril] Hey!

11:14.548 --> 11:17.134
I won't have you manhandling
my beautiful things!

11:17.218 --> 11:20.429
-Well, how do I know it's not in there?
-Because we said so.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.514
Who's "we"?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.975
[scoffs] Is that supposed to be funny?

11:26.977 --> 11:28.562
-[gun zaps]
-[Cyril wailing]

11:28.646 --> 11:30.689
[laughs] Hope it was his dick.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.608
-[Cyril] Right in the foot!
-Eh.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.736
-[Lana] Any luck?
-No, Lana.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.364
And this is my area, so...

11:38.906 --> 11:40.032
So...

11:40.116 --> 11:43.702
[chuckles]
So-- So, talk about space whores, huh?

11:43.786 --> 11:44.870
-Excuse me?
-I--

11:44.954 --> 11:46.038
Um...

11:46.122 --> 11:48.874
Uh, nothing. Uh, ne-- never mind.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.709
I'll never your mind.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.044
Um, airball.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.130
[Lana] I'll... air your balls.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.923
[chuckles] Ye-- Yeah. You will.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.007
[Lana] Goddamn it!

11:57.091 --> 11:59.218
[sighs]
Holy shit, I think I'm seeing things.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.137
I maybe need to get some sleep, huh?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.639
[chuckles] Or at least my balls aired out.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.224
Yeah, right?

12:05.307 --> 12:06.308
-[screams]
-[man] Hey!

12:06.392 --> 12:08.227
-Who the hell are you, man?
-[man] What are you--

12:08.310 --> 12:10.312
I'm TV's Michael Gray!

12:10.396 --> 12:11.897
TV's Michael Gray who?

12:12.523 --> 12:16.735
[Michael] Uh, TV's Michael Gray
says quit being a dick and open the door?

12:17.319 --> 12:19.029
Seriously, quit being a dick.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.157
Okay, um... Hang on.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.534
Okay, on three. Ready?

12:23.617 --> 12:26.412
-[Michael] Can we not do it on one?
-Shut up! Okay.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.496
One...

12:27.580 --> 12:28.581
two!

12:31.584 --> 12:33.919
[gulps] Disconcerting.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.299
[whispering] Michael?

12:39.133 --> 12:40.593
TV's Michael Gray?

12:40.676 --> 12:42.303
Mikey-Mike, where are you?

12:42.386 --> 12:45.973
-[Pam] Who the hell's Mikey-Mike?
-Exactly, that's what I'm-- [screams]

12:46.056 --> 12:48.809
'Cause you think he'd like some of this?
[grunting]

12:49.560 --> 12:52.730
What? No! Stop that!
Wha-- What are you doing?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.857
[munching]

12:54.940 --> 12:56.901
[muffled] I'm hungry! Sue me.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.238
And then get up to the bridge.
Her Lanaship has some big announcement.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.992
-Whoa, what, did somebody find it?
-[burps] Find what?

13:06.118 --> 13:07.161
What cube?

13:07.244 --> 13:11.040
Mother, I am extremely not in the mood,
so, seriously, where is it?

13:11.123 --> 13:14.502
You mean like an ice cube
or something in a Rubik--

13:14.585 --> 13:16.754
-Quit dicking around already!
-Hey, whoa!

13:16.837 --> 13:20.382
I'm talking about the mysterious
and possibly haunted ghost cube

13:20.466 --> 13:22.176
that Carol got her head stuck in.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.636
I think I'd remember that.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.598
And I'd be the first one to believe
she got her head stuck in something.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.518
-Thank you.
-But you are just sounding insane.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.269
You sound insane!

13:32.353 --> 13:35.773
All of you! Oh, oh!
And I all know what you're trying to do.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.775
You wanna...

13:37.858 --> 13:40.194
maybe walk us through that?

13:40.277 --> 13:41.529
[chuckles] Oh, my God!

13:41.612 --> 13:45.324
I know somebody found the cube
and that it's findies keepies.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.784
You mean "finders keepers."

13:46.867 --> 13:48.953
But don't stand there and lie to me.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.205
-Nobody's--
-Plus, you dressing like a whore?

13:51.288 --> 13:52.289
Excuse me?

13:52.373 --> 13:54.208
And how is Cyril's foot okay?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.502
-Uh, what, now?
-You got shot in the foot, asshole!

13:56.585 --> 13:59.380
And, oh, my God, TV's Michael Gray?

13:59.463 --> 14:00.798
-TV's Michael who?
-Huh?

14:00.881 --> 14:04.051
All right. I don't know
if you got in the meds locker

14:04.134 --> 14:07.888
or if this is just the onset
of tertiary syphilis, but--

14:07.972 --> 14:11.308
-He better not have syphilis.
-Why had he better not have syphilis?

14:11.392 --> 14:12.393
I-- Wh--

14:12.476 --> 14:14.144
Because syphilis is bad, dude.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.896
-Listen to me, goddamn it!
-[glass shatters]

14:15.980 --> 14:16.981
-Whoa!
-Easy!

14:17.064 --> 14:18.065
Whoa, whoa, man!

14:18.148 --> 14:20.109
And speaking of meds,

14:20.192 --> 14:23.737
don't you think you could use
a bit of a... relaxer?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.698
-No!
-Oh, now.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.576
Krieger, don't you have something
to take the edge off?

14:28.659 --> 14:30.035
As a matter of fact...

14:30.411 --> 14:33.080
You and your pills keep away from me,
you-- you dickless fish!

14:33.163 --> 14:34.206
-[gun clicks]
-Wha--

14:34.290 --> 14:36.166
-[Ray] He's got a gun!
-Sterling!

14:36.250 --> 14:38.419
Sterling, look at me.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.212
Now, I don't know what's wrong,

14:40.296 --> 14:43.883
but I promise you,
whatever it is, we'll fix it.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.676
But first you have to trust us.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.970
-Oh, no.
-Suit yourself. Krieger?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.805
-[Krieger] Yep, yep, yep!
-No, no, no, no--

14:49.889 --> 14:51.015
[groans]

14:51.432 --> 14:53.017
Oh. Ye--

14:53.559 --> 14:55.060
-You dick.
-[gunshot]

14:55.144 --> 14:56.145
-Whoa!
-Jesus!

14:56.228 --> 14:57.479
[Cyril wailing]

14:57.563 --> 14:58.606
[chuckles weakly]

14:59.189 --> 15:00.399
[body thuds]

15:00.482 --> 15:03.110
[sighs] All right.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.987
Krieger, take him down to the med lab

15:05.070 --> 15:07.740
and try to find out
what in the hell's the matter with him.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.658
[whining] Him? What about me?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.368
We know what's wrong with you.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.870
Yeah. Foot hole.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.206
-[Malory] Well?
-[Krieger] Well, it's really kinda weird.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.791
[Lana] Uh, no shit.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.960
[Krieger] The scanner shows normal vitals

15:20.044 --> 15:23.255
and doesn't show anything physically
or neurologically unusual.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.049
No drugs in his system

15:25.132 --> 15:27.843
and just what I assume
is a therapeutic level of bourbon.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.386
[Lana] And...

15:29.470 --> 15:30.512
no syphilis?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.765
No venereal disease of any kind.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.350
[softly] Or judgment, by the way.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.643
-Don't care.
-Eh.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.978
How does that thing know all that?

15:38.062 --> 15:39.396
I know! Pretty great.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.732
All right. Keep scanning or whatever,

15:41.815 --> 15:44.818
and keep him down here
until you find out what's wrong with him.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.029
-[ice cubes rattle]
-My therapeutic levels are low.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.323
And I could actually use
some sterilizing wipes.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.407
I'll bet.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.076
-Keep an eye on him?
-Mm-hmm.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.996
[keypad beeping]

15:56.080 --> 15:57.915
-Uh... hello?
-[lock clicks]

15:57.998 --> 16:00.709
Is there a reason
you locked the door from the outside?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.504
Krieger? Hello?

16:03.587 --> 16:05.464
Ugh. Super.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.840
-Is it?
-[exclaims]

16:06.924 --> 16:10.344
Jesus Christ, Archer! What are you doing?
You scared the shit out of me!

16:10.427 --> 16:11.428
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.683
Well, what'd ya expect, nerfnuts?
It's alcohol. It's gonna hurt.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.269
-Well, if you think that hurt--
-Yes! Yes, I do think it hurt!

16:19.353 --> 16:21.271
[Malory] You'd better not be wasting that.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.525
Um, guess it kind of depends
on how you mean.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.861
I mean, we've really only got
two options here, Lana.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.240
One is that this is all some sort of ruse,

16:31.323 --> 16:33.534
and the other is that I'm crazy.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.953
You're kind of <i>acting</i> crazy.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.788
I don't think I'm acting crazy.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.290
That's kind of one of the symptoms.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.668
Ah, the old catch-21.

16:42.751 --> 16:46.296
[Lana chuckles nervously]
Twenty-one, 22, whatever it takes.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.381
-[hair rips]
-Ow!

16:47.464 --> 16:48.465
Shit!

16:48.549 --> 16:50.759
Jesus Christ, you <i>are</i> crazy!

16:50.843 --> 16:52.928
Yeah? Would a crazy person do <i>this</i>?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.014
-[Lana] No, no, no, no, wait!
-[roars]

16:56.098 --> 16:57.099
[weakly] Yes.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.101
[static crackling]

16:59.184 --> 17:00.602

-[Lana grunts]

-Hey, what the--

-[muffled screaming]
-[gasps]

17:17.119 --> 17:18.328
[alarm blaring]

17:18.412 --> 17:20.122
[female computer voice]
<i>Emergency. Med lab.</i>

17:20.205 --> 17:21.206
What emergency?

17:21.290 --> 17:24.334
Well, it has been almost a minute
since Archer got some attention.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.878
You're just a mess.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.212
Holy shit! Look!

17:27.296 --> 17:30.007
[Malory] Oh, my God! Come on!

17:30.090 --> 17:32.968
-Come on, come on, come on, come on!
-[chirps]

17:33.052 --> 17:34.428

-Space phrasing.

-That's just how it comes!
-Twofer.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.940
Oh, my God, just reset it, Dr. Science!

17:47.024 --> 17:49.234
[shouting] Will you shut up?

17:49.318 --> 17:52.780
If I mess up,
I have to start all over again!

17:52.863 --> 17:54.364
[Archer grunts]

17:54.448 --> 17:55.783
