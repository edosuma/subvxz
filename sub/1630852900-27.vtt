WEBVTT

00:32.432 --> 00:33.433
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.433 --> 00:34.300
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.300 --> 00:35.034
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.034 --> 00:37.103
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.805
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK FROM

00:38.805 --> 00:40.373
MASSIVE PROTESTS STILL ONGOING

00:40.373 --> 00:42.375
IN IRAN, TO THE FACT TOM BRADY

00:42.375 --> 00:43.810
SUDDENLY HAS ONE LESS RING.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.678
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START IN THE

00:45.678 --> 00:46.980
UK, WHERE THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR

00:46.980 --> 00:48.815
CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.049
AFTER JUST 45 DAYS ON THE

00:50.049 --> 00:52.585
JOB, LIZ TRUSS IS OUT.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.354
HER VERY BRIEF STINT AT DOWNING

00:54.354 --> 00:55.755
STREET CHAOTIC FROM THE START.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.090
THIS MEME TAKING OVER THE

00:57.090 --> 00:58.725
INTERNET, THE CHALLENGE FROM A

00:58.725 --> 01:00.860
TABLOID HERE WHICH WILL LAST

01:00.860 --> 01:02.896
LONGER, THIS HEAD OF ICEBERG

01:02.896 --> 01:04.197
LETTUCE OR LIZ TRUSS?

01:04.197 --> 01:06.399
THERE WAS EVEN A LETTUCE LIVE

01:06.399 --> 01:07.834
STREAM, AND LAST NIGHT IT WAS

01:07.834 --> 01:09.202
PROJECTED ON THE WALLS OF

01:09.202 --> 01:10.503
PARLIAMENT THE VICTORIOUS HEAD

01:10.503 --> 01:11.738
OF LETTUCE.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.773
PRETTY GOOD!

01:13.773 --> 01:14.808
FROM THE CHALLENGE ITSELF, TO

01:14.808 --> 01:17.010
THE PHRASE "VICTORIOUS HEAD OF

01:17.010 --> 01:18.711
LETTUCE," TO THE GOOGLY EYES AND

01:18.711 --> 01:20.847
THE ADORABLE BLONDE BOB, EVERY

01:20.847 --> 01:21.581
STEP WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND

01:21.581 --> 01:24.651
BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.253
HONESTLY, FROM ONE LEAF

01:27.253 --> 01:31.124
VEGETABLE LOVER TO ANOTHER?

01:31.124 --> 01:31.591
YOU HAVE MY RESPECT.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.192
AND INCREDIBLY, THE RUN-UP TO

01:32.192 --> 01:32.859
ALL THAT WAS EVEN MORE CHAOTIC.

01:32.859 --> 01:33.660
VERY BASICALLY, LIZ TRUSS'S

01:33.660 --> 01:34.494
CHANCELLOR WAS FIRED, BECOMING

01:34.494 --> 01:35.929
THE SECOND-SHORTEST-SERVING

01:35.929 --> 01:37.831
CHANCELLOR IN BRITISH HISTORY,

01:37.831 --> 01:38.598
AFTER THIS GUY, THOUGH AT LEAST

01:38.598 --> 01:39.299
HE HAD THE GOOD EXCUSE OF

01:39.299 --> 01:40.767
"HE DIED."

01:40.767 --> 01:42.368
THEN HER HOME SECRETARY, SUELLA

01:42.368 --> 01:43.703
BRAVERMAN, WAS FORCED TO RESIGN

01:43.703 --> 01:44.737
AFTER BREACHING SECURITY

01:44.737 --> 01:46.039
PROCEDURES BY USING HER PERSONAL

01:46.039 --> 01:46.606
EMAIL TO SEND A GOVERNMENT

01:46.606 --> 01:47.707
DOCUMENT.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.476
THEN HER OWN PARTY TORE ITSELF

01:49.476 --> 01:50.844
APART IN A CHAOTIC VOTE ON

01:50.844 --> 01:52.245
FRACKING, PROMPTING ONE PARTY

01:52.245 --> 01:53.913
LEADER TO GIVE AN INCREDIBLE

01:53.913 --> 01:55.515
QUOTE, PERHAPS BEST DELIVERED BY

01:55.515 --> 01:57.116
THIS GERMAN NEWS OUTLET.

01:57.116 --> 01:58.451
AND IF YOU DON'T SPEAK GERMAN,

01:58.451 --> 02:01.421
DON'T WORRY-- THEY SWITCH TO

02:01.421 --> 02:02.355
ENGLISH FOR THE IMPORTANT PART.

02:02.355 --> 02:02.856
[SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH

02:02.856 --> 02:05.391
LANGUAGE]

02:05.391 --> 02:07.560
I'M FUCKING FURIOUS AND I DON'T

02:07.560 --> 02:10.196
FUCKING CARE ANYMORE.

02:10.196 --> 02:11.965
PERFECT.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.500
AND SO MUCH BETTER WITH A GERMAN

02:13.500 --> 02:16.135
ACCENT WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING

02:16.135 --> 02:17.670
SOUND A THOUSAND TIMES MEANER.

02:17.670 --> 02:18.505
IF SOMEONE SAID TO YOU "NICE

02:18.505 --> 02:19.839
OUTFIT," YOU'D BE DELIGHTED.

02:19.839 --> 02:21.908
BUT IF THEY SAID "NICE OUTFIT,"

02:21.908 --> 02:24.177
YOU WOULD KILL YOURSELF.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.112
AT THAT POINT, ALL DECORUM WAS

02:26.112 --> 02:26.713
BASICALLY GONE.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.415
PERHAPS THE NADIR WAS AFTER THIS

02:29.415 --> 02:31.851
CONTENTIOUS INTERVIEW BETWEEN A

02:31.851 --> 02:33.286
REPORTER AT DOWNING STREET, AND

02:33.286 --> 02:34.320
MP STEVE BAKER, ONE OF THE LAST

02:34.320 --> 02:35.188
TRUSS SUPPORTERS.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.422
THE REPORTER'S MIC WAS LEFT ON

02:36.422 --> 02:37.724
AFTER THE INTERVIEW HAD ENDED,

02:37.724 --> 02:39.158
AND YOU COULD HEAR HIM RESPOND

02:39.158 --> 02:42.262
TO BAKER CLAIMING HE'D ASKED A

02:42.262 --> 02:42.629
STUPID QUESTION.

02:42.629 --> 02:46.199
THANKS A LOT, STEVE.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.800
IT WASN'T A STUPID QUESTION,

02:47.800 --> 02:49.068
STEVE, YOU KNOW IT.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.203
I'M VERY HAPPY TO GO UP AGAINST

02:50.203 --> 02:54.107
YOU ON TRUSS ANY DAY.

02:55.808 --> 02:58.077
WHAT A CUNT.

02:58.077 --> 03:00.446
NOW, I KNOW THAT SOUNDS

03:00.446 --> 03:01.848
BAD TO AMERICAN EARS.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.283
BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND--

03:03.283 --> 03:05.718
THERE'S NOTHING MORE BRITISH

03:05.718 --> 03:06.819
THAN POLITELY THANKING SOMEONE

03:06.819 --> 03:08.221
FOR A DISAGREEMENT, THEN

03:08.221 --> 03:09.756
CHEERILY CALLING THEM A CUNT.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.224
IT WASN'T IN THE U.S. VERSION,

03:11.224 --> 03:13.526
BUT IT IS HOW "PADDINGTON 2"

03:13.526 --> 03:14.994
ENDS.

03:14.994 --> 03:16.930
TRUSS IS

03:16.930 --> 03:17.664
OUT, AND THIS MAN, RISHI SUNAK,

03:17.664 --> 03:18.064
IS IN.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.732
AND HE INHERITS AN EVEN BIGGER

03:19.732 --> 03:20.667
MESS THAN THE ONE TRUSS DID.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.435
BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO MAKE

03:22.435 --> 03:23.570
SEVERE CUTS TO PUBLIC SPENDING

03:23.570 --> 03:25.271
WHICH WILL BE ESPECIALLY

03:25.271 --> 03:26.272
DIFFICULT TO TAKE COMING FROM

03:26.272 --> 03:26.973
HIM, BECAUSE HE'S INCREDIBLY

03:26.973 --> 03:28.241
WEALTHY.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.776
SUNAK RANKS AMONG THE U.K.'S

03:29.776 --> 03:31.578
RICHEST AND HAS BEEN LABELED OUT

03:31.578 --> 03:34.347
OF TOUCH WITH ORDINARY VOTERS.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.016
THIS 2001 BBC DOCUMENTARY CLIP

03:37.016 --> 03:38.384
WHEN HE WAS STILL AT UNIVERSITY

03:38.384 --> 03:39.586
LATER WENT VIRAL AND IT DIDN'T

03:39.586 --> 03:41.087
HELP.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.388
I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE, YOU

03:42.388 --> 03:43.590
KNOW, WORKING CLASS, BUT--

03:43.590 --> 03:44.857
WELL, NOT WORKING CLASS, BUT I

03:44.857 --> 03:46.225
MIX AND MATCH AND THEN I GO TO

03:46.225 --> 03:48.461
SEE KIDS FROM AN INNER CITY

03:48.461 --> 03:49.262
STATE SCHOOL AND TELL THEM, YOU

03:49.262 --> 03:53.066
KNOW, TO APPLY TO OXFORD.

03:53.066 --> 03:53.800
AH, GREAT STRATEGY.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.434
"MY ELITE EDUCATION HAS TAUGHT

03:54.434 --> 03:56.669
ME THAT YOU'RE MERE VICTIMS OF A

03:56.669 --> 03:57.403
COMPLEX WEB OF SYSTEMIC

03:57.403 --> 03:58.805
INEQUITY, BUT ALSO...

03:58.805 --> 04:02.175
WHAT IF YOU JUST WEREN'T?"

04:02.175 --> 04:03.343
AND IT'S NOT LIKE SUNAK'S GOTTEN

04:03.343 --> 04:06.579
MUCH BETTER AT DISPLAYING A

04:06.579 --> 04:07.213
COMMON TOUCH SINCE THEN-- HE

04:07.213 --> 04:08.715
ONCE TRIED TO PROMOTE A CUT IN

04:08.715 --> 04:09.782
FUEL PRICES BY BEING

04:09.782 --> 04:10.984
PHOTOGRAPHED FILLING UP A CAR

04:10.984 --> 04:12.952
THAT, IT TURNED OUT, WASN'T HIS.

04:12.952 --> 04:17.590
WHICH, TO BE FAIR, I COULD'VE

04:17.590 --> 04:18.057
TOLD YOU STRAIGHTAWAY.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.258
THAT CAR IS A BURGUNDY KIA RIO.

04:19.258 --> 04:19.926
THE CLOSEST RISHI WOULD GET TO A

04:19.926 --> 04:21.027
CAR LIKE THAT IS TO TELL IT TO

04:21.027 --> 04:22.762
CONSIDER BECOMING A ROLLS ROYCE.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.464
AND HIS TENURE AS PRIME MINISTER

04:24.464 --> 04:26.299
IS ALREADY OFF TO A QUESTIONABLE

04:26.299 --> 04:27.433
START, GIVEN ONE OF HIS FIRST

04:27.433 --> 04:29.168
MOVES WAS TO RE-APPOINT SUELLA

04:29.168 --> 04:30.470
BRAVERMAN AS HOME SECRETARY,

04:30.470 --> 04:32.305
DESPITE THE FACT, REMEMBER,

04:32.305 --> 04:33.573
SHE'D BEEN FORCED OUT OF THAT

04:33.573 --> 04:34.874
JOB IN DISGRACE JUST SIX DAYS

04:34.874 --> 04:37.110
PREVIOUSLY.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.411
AND SHE IS A HARD-LINER, KNOWN

04:38.411 --> 04:39.912
FOR BOTH HER ANTI-IMMIGRATION

04:39.912 --> 04:41.481
STANCES, AND STATEMENTS LIKE

04:41.481 --> 04:43.116
THIS, ON UK WELFARE RECIPIENTS.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.884
THERE IS STILL A STUBBORN

04:44.884 --> 04:46.419
CORE OF OUR POPULATION THAT SEES

04:46.419 --> 04:48.821
WELFARE AS THE GO-TO OPTION AND

04:48.821 --> 04:50.556
IS NOT MOTIVATED FOR FINANCIAL

04:50.556 --> 04:51.357
OR OTHER REASONS TO GET OUT

04:51.357 --> 04:53.559
THERE AND WORK.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.028
AND I THINK THE STICK-- WE'VE

04:55.028 --> 04:56.596
GOT WE'VE GOT LOTS OF CARROTS,

04:56.596 --> 04:58.197
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF CARROTS TO GET

04:58.197 --> 04:58.798
PEOPLE INTO WORK-- BUT WE'VE

04:58.798 --> 05:00.700
GOT TO ACTUALLY ADD MORE

05:00.700 --> 05:02.702
CONDITIONALITY TO THE WAY WE

05:02.702 --> 05:03.603
ADMINISTER WELFARE AND MORE-- A

05:03.603 --> 05:06.239
BIT MORE STICK TO ENSURE THAT IT

05:06.239 --> 05:07.206
ACTUALLY PAYS FOR PEOPLE TO GET

05:07.206 --> 05:07.740
OFF WELFARE.

05:07.740 --> 05:08.975
WOW.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.310
THERE'S SO MUCH WRONG WITH THAT,

05:11.310 --> 05:12.845
BUT IF YOU WANT A PORTION OF THE

05:12.845 --> 05:14.747
POPULATION TO BELIEVE YOU

05:14.747 --> 05:17.250
RESPECT THEM, MAYBE DON'T REFER

05:17.250 --> 05:18.117
TO THEM AS HORSES.

05:18.117 --> 05:18.851
AND THAT'S COMING FROM ME,

05:18.851 --> 05:20.453
SOMEONE WHO, ARGUABLY, RESPECTS

05:20.453 --> 05:22.922
HORSES TOO MUCH.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.157
I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL

05:24.157 --> 05:25.658
GOOD.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.627
BUT ULTIMATELY, SUNAK'S

05:27.627 --> 05:28.394
INCREDIBLY LUCKY THAT HE'S

05:28.394 --> 05:29.095
FOLLOWING LIZ TRUSS.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.464
BECAUSE THE BAR IS SO LOW.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.999
ALL HE REALLY HAS TO DO IS NOT

05:32.999 --> 05:34.067
PERSONALLY THROW THE ECONOMY

05:34.067 --> 05:35.234
INTO A TAILSPIN, AND DELIVER A

05:35.234 --> 05:37.036
SPEECH WITHOUT LEAVING A WEIRD

05:37.036 --> 05:38.204
PAUSE FOR CLAPTER AFTER SAYING

05:38.204 --> 05:39.672
"PORK MARKETS."

05:39.672 --> 05:41.207
BUT HE'S NOT EVEN OFF TO A GOOD

05:41.207 --> 05:42.508
START THERE, BECAUSE THIS WAS

05:42.508 --> 05:43.943
HOW HE ENDED HIS FIRST PUBLIC

05:43.943 --> 05:45.278
ADDRESS.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.114
I WILL WORK DAY-IN, DAY-OUT,

05:48.114 --> 05:49.782
TO DELIVER FOR THE BRITISH

05:49.782 --> 05:57.824
PEOPLE.

05:58.257 --> 06:00.426
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:00.426 --> 06:01.027
HE LOOKS LIKE HE WAS READING A

06:01.027 --> 06:02.395
TELEPROMPTER THAT MALFUNCTIONED

06:02.395 --> 06:03.696
BY REPLACING HIS SPEECH WITH THE

06:03.696 --> 06:04.664
COMMAND "HAVE A PANIC ATTACK,

06:04.664 --> 06:06.632
NOW."

06:06.632 --> 06:08.201
DESPITE SUNAK'S MANY

06:08.201 --> 06:11.704
SHORTCOMINGS, HE'LL PROBABLY

06:11.704 --> 06:12.271
LAST LONGER THAN LIZ TRUSS.

06:12.271 --> 06:12.905
BUT MAYBE NOT MUCH LONGER.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.173
BECAUSE THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE

06:14.173 --> 06:15.541
JUSTIFIABLY-- TO QUOTE MY NEW

06:15.541 --> 06:16.976
FAVORITE BROADCASTER-- "FUCKING

06:16.976 --> 06:18.211
FURIOUS AND THEY DON'T FUCKING

06:18.211 --> 06:19.645
CARE ANYMORE."

06:19.645 --> 06:21.347
AND NOW THIS.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.083
AND NOW,

06:24.083 --> 06:25.752
UNNECESSARY FULL DISCLOSURE.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.053
FULL DISCLOSURE, I'M NOT A

06:27.053 --> 06:28.454
FINANCE GUY.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.822
HAVEN'T STUDIED IT, DON'T

06:29.822 --> 06:30.757
MUCH UNDERSTAND IT.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.725
FULL DISCLOSURE, I WAS A VERY

06:32.725 --> 06:34.961
AMATEUR NATIONAL ANTHEM SINGER.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.863
FULL DISCLOSURE, I WAS A

06:36.863 --> 06:40.600
WAITER AT THE OLIVE GARDEN.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.701
FULL DISCLOSURE, I'VE ALWAYS

06:41.701 --> 06:43.636
WANTED A BOSTON WHALER.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.538
FULL DISCLOSURE, I HAD A QTIP

06:45.538 --> 06:46.572
IN MY EAR LAST NIGHT.

06:46.572 --> 06:52.378
FULL DISCLOSURE, THE OYSTERS

06:52.378 --> 06:56.749
WERE NOT FROM THE EAST RIVER.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.416
FULL DISCLOSURE, I'M A COOKIE

06:57.416 --> 06:58.351

06:58.351 --> 07:00.620
FULL DISCLOSURE, GO GATERS.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.755
FULL DISCLOSURE, NOT THE BEST

07:02.755 --> 07:04.090
JOB I'VE HAD.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.858
FULL DISCLOSURE, THERE'S AN

07:05.858 --> 07:07.426
ACTION FIGURE OF ME IN MY OFFICE

07:07.426 --> 07:10.930
MADE OUT OF FONDANT.

07:13.232 --> 07:13.666
MOVING ON.

07:13.666 --> 07:14.300
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:14.300 --> 07:15.601
CRIME.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.369
BATMAN'S ADVERSARY, AND ALSO,

07:16.369 --> 07:19.071
HIS KINK.

07:19.071 --> 07:22.175
YOU THINK SOMEONE DRESSES IN A

07:22.175 --> 07:22.708
RUBBER SUIT JUST TO AVENGE

07:22.708 --> 07:23.042
THEIR PARENTS?

07:23.042 --> 07:23.676
HE'S A FURRY WITH A GADGET BELT.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.478
GROW UP.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.947
APPROACHING, "TOUGH ON CRIME"

07:27.947 --> 07:29.148
RHETORIC HAS BEEN A KEY FEATURE

07:29.148 --> 07:30.817
OF REPUBLICAN ATTACK ADS, OFTEN

07:30.817 --> 07:31.918
HIGHLIGHTING ONE POLICY IN

07:31.918 --> 07:34.821
BAIL REFORM.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.622
DO YOU FEEL SAFE?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.658
MANDELA BARNES WOULD ELIMINATE

07:38.658 --> 07:40.259
CASH BAIL, SETTING ACCUSED

07:40.259 --> 07:41.260
CRIMINALS FREE INTO THE

07:41.260 --> 07:42.895
COMMUNITY BEFORE TRIAL.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.897
LANDSMAN WANTS TO END CASH

07:44.897 --> 07:46.265
BAIL, PUTTING DANGEROUS

07:46.265 --> 07:47.300
CRIMINALS BACK ON THE STREETS.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.569
BEASLEY SUPPORTS ENDING CASH

07:49.569 --> 07:50.236
BAIL, LETTING CRIMINALS OUT OF

07:50.236 --> 07:55.675
JAIL.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.577
USING CASHLESS BAILS AND HIS

07:57.577 --> 08:00.513
OWN LAWLESS POLICIES, HE PUT

08:00.513 --> 08:02.248
CRIMINALS BACK ON THE STREETS

08:02.248 --> 08:02.849
AND TURNED NEIGHBORHOODS INTO

08:02.849 --> 08:03.616
DANGER ZONES.

08:03.616 --> 08:04.116
OKAY, OF COURSE

08:04.116 --> 08:04.750
EVERYTHING SEEMS SCARIER IF YOU

08:04.750 --> 08:05.318
END IT WITH A SHOT OF A BODY

08:05.318 --> 08:06.552
BAG.

08:06.552 --> 08:07.486
FOR INSTANCE, DOC MCSTUFFINS?

08:07.486 --> 08:08.321
NOT A SCARY SHOW.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.989
BUT IF THEY DID AN EPISODE SET

08:09.989 --> 08:11.757
IN THE MCSTUFFINS MORGUE, YOUR

08:11.757 --> 08:12.358
KID'S GOING TO HAVE NIGHTMARES

08:12.358 --> 08:14.293
FOR A WHILE.

08:14.293 --> 08:15.194
THESE ATTACK ADS COME AT A

08:15.194 --> 08:16.295
CRITICAL JUNCTURE FOR THE

08:16.295 --> 08:17.763
MOVEMENT TO REDUCE THE USE OF

08:17.763 --> 08:18.998
CASH BAIL.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.733
BECAUSE SINCE 2011 AT LEAST 19

08:20.733 --> 08:22.902
STATES AND DOZENS OF LOCAL

08:22.902 --> 08:24.403
JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED

08:24.403 --> 08:26.739
BAIL-REFORM POLICIES.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.674
BUT MANY PLACES HAVE RECENTLY

08:28.674 --> 08:31.077
BEGUN ROLLING BACK THOSE REFORMS

08:31.077 --> 08:31.777
BECAUSE AMID THE RECENT SPIKE

08:31.777 --> 08:33.246
IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CRIME,

08:33.246 --> 08:35.214
CRITICS ARE POINTING AT BAIL

08:35.214 --> 08:36.682
REFORM AS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF IT.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.886
LIBERAL LAWMAKERS ENDED THE

08:39.886 --> 08:41.654
BAIL FOR MOST OFFENSES.

08:41.654 --> 08:42.321
THEY CREATED A REVOLVING DOOR OF

08:42.321 --> 08:43.389
CRIMINALITY.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.391
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET

08:45.391 --> 08:47.693
ARRESTED AND THEN PUT IN JAIL

08:47.693 --> 08:49.028
UNLESS YOU KILL SOMEBODY.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.796
IT IS BAFFLING TO ME THAT WE

08:50.796 --> 08:52.365
HAVE POLITICIANS THAT AREN'T

08:52.365 --> 08:55.301
SUPPORTING POLICIES THAT ARE

08:55.301 --> 08:57.003
GONNA MAKE THINGS BETTER.

08:57.003 --> 08:57.536
IN FACT, THEY'RE DOING THE

08:57.536 --> 08:58.137
OPPOSITE, AND STILL SUPPORTING

08:58.137 --> 08:58.738
BAIL REFORM AND DEFUNDING THE

08:58.738 --> 08:59.238
POLICE.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.773
THERE'S A CORRELATION BETWEEN

09:00.773 --> 09:02.575
THE BAIL REFORM AND WHAT'S

09:02.575 --> 09:05.411
HAPPENING IN OUR CITY.

09:05.411 --> 09:06.779
IT SEEMS SO CLEAR THAT IT IS,

09:06.779 --> 09:08.247
AND TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY'S

09:08.247 --> 09:10.283
FINEST POLICE DEPARTMENT IS A

09:10.283 --> 09:11.450
CRIME, I THINK, ON ITS OWN.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.251
WOW.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.486
I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED ANYTHING

09:13.486 --> 09:15.154
SEEMS CLEAR TO A MAN WITH

09:15.154 --> 09:16.689
RESTING CONCUSSION FACE.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.324
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S STUDYING A

09:18.324 --> 09:20.559
FULL BODY MIRROR, DESPERATELY

09:20.559 --> 09:21.794
TRYING TO FIND HIS PENIS.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.062
IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE ANY

09:23.062 --> 09:24.864
CRIME MENTIONED ON FOX NEWS GETS

09:24.864 --> 09:27.400
LINKED TO BAIL REFORM, WHETHER

09:27.400 --> 09:28.668
IT'S RELEVANT OR NOT.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.536
EVEN AFTER NANCY PELOSI'S

09:30.536 --> 09:31.904
HUSBAND WAS ATTACKED WITH A

09:31.904 --> 09:33.205
HAMMER ON FRIDAY MORNING-- BY

09:33.205 --> 09:35.007
SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT OUT ON BAIL

09:35.007 --> 09:36.108
THEY HAD A REPUBLICAN

09:36.108 --> 09:37.810
CONGRESSMAN ON TO SAY THIS.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.011
WHEN YOU LET DANGEROUS

09:39.011 --> 09:41.981
CRIMINALS OUT ON THE STREETS

09:41.981 --> 09:44.083
WITH BAIL AND NOT PUT THEM IN

09:44.083 --> 09:47.219
PRISON, YOU'RE ASKING FOR THIS

09:47.219 --> 09:48.387
INCIDENT TO HAPPEN.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.823
NOW HE'S WRONG ABOUT A

09:50.823 --> 09:51.424
FEW THINGS THERE-- AGAIN, THE

09:51.424 --> 09:52.959
SUSPECT WASN'T OUT ON BAIL.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.161
ALSO, NO ONE GETS BAILED OUT OF

09:55.161 --> 09:55.761
PRISON, THAT'S WHERE CONVICTED

09:55.761 --> 09:56.796
PEOPLE GO.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.331
AND FINALLY, CHOOSING A NARROW

09:58.331 --> 09:59.398
TIE KNOT WHEN YOUR HEAD'S THAT

09:59.398 --> 10:01.200
BIG MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A

10:01.200 --> 10:03.069
BIRTHDAY BALLOON SAILING OVER

10:03.069 --> 10:03.769
THE CAPITOL DOME.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.504
THAT'S THREE BIG MISTAKES FROM

10:05.504 --> 10:07.440
THAT VERY GRUMPY BALLOON.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.075
BUT GIVEN THAT YOU'RE HEARING

10:09.075 --> 10:09.976
MISLEADING ATTACKS LIKE THAT

10:09.976 --> 10:12.211
EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A

10:12.211 --> 10:13.412
REAL CHANCE OF ALL THE PROGRESS

10:13.412 --> 10:15.181
WE'VE MADE BEING UNDONE.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.549
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT BAIL

10:16.549 --> 10:17.717
REFORM.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.186
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY OUR SECOND

10:20.186 --> 10:20.853
STORY ON BAIL, WE FIRST

10:20.853 --> 10:21.620
COVERED IT BACK IN 2015.

10:21.620 --> 10:22.521
BUT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT

10:22.521 --> 10:24.123
EPISODE BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO

10:24.123 --> 10:25.758
BUSY WATCHING THE 69TH ANNUAL

10:25.758 --> 10:27.460
TONY AWARDS AIRING THE SAME

10:27.460 --> 10:28.761
NIGHT WHERE-- AND THIS IS TRUE

10:28.761 --> 10:30.062
KRISTIN CHENOWTH AND ALAN

10:30.062 --> 10:31.230
CUMMING OPENED THE SHOW BY

10:31.230 --> 10:32.565
HIGHLIGHTING ONE PARTICULAR

10:32.565 --> 10:34.800
CELEBRITY IN THE AUDIENCE.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.434

11:13.773 --> 11:15.708
SO IF YOU MISSED OUR FIRST

11:15.708 --> 11:17.176
STORY, HERE'S A BRIEF RECAP: IF

11:17.176 --> 11:18.778
YOU'RE ARRESTED, IN ORDER TO BE

11:18.778 --> 11:20.179
RELEASED AWAITING TRIAL, YOU'RE

11:20.179 --> 11:21.047
OFTEN REQUIRED TO LEAVE A

11:21.047 --> 11:22.148
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY, OR

11:22.148 --> 11:23.849
"BAIL," WITH THE COURT, AS

11:23.849 --> 11:25.951
COLLATERAL, WITH THE IDEA THAT

11:25.951 --> 11:27.086
IT'LL ENSURE YOU RETURN.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.321
AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF ISSUES

11:29.321 --> 11:29.889
WITH THIS SYSTEM-- STARTING

11:29.889 --> 11:30.689
WITH THE FACT THAT BAIL HEARINGS

11:30.689 --> 11:32.992
CAN BE ARBITRARY, AT BEST.

11:32.992 --> 11:33.726
BECAUSE WHILE YOU MIGHT ASSUME A

11:33.726 --> 11:35.127
JUDGE WOULD CAREFULLY WEIGH

11:35.127 --> 11:36.362
SOMEONE'S CHARGES AND

11:36.362 --> 11:38.030
CIRCUMSTANCES TO DECIDE WHETHER

11:38.030 --> 11:39.131
THERE'S ANY REASON THEY

11:39.131 --> 11:40.699
SHOULDN'T BE RELEASED, THE

11:40.699 --> 11:42.501
REALITY CAN LOOK VERY DIFFERENT.

11:42.501 --> 11:43.669
TAKE THIS HEARING IN DALLAS.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.871
WE'RE GOING TO BLEEP THE

11:45.871 --> 11:47.006
PERSON'S LAST NAME, BUT I'M

11:47.006 --> 11:48.174
GOING TO SHOW YOU HER HEARING IN

11:48.174 --> 11:49.475
ITS ENTIRETY.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.446
PENNY , YOU'RE HERE ON

11:53.446 --> 11:54.947
STATE JAIL FELONY, THEFT WITH

11:54.947 --> 11:55.915
PREVIOUS CONVICTION, BOND IS

11:55.915 --> 11:57.149
$5000.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.386
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.488
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT SHOULD

12:02.488 --> 12:03.122
TAKE TO PUT A PRICE ON SOMEONE'S

12:03.122 --> 12:04.590
FREEDOM, BUT IT PROBABLY

12:04.590 --> 12:05.825
SHOULDN'T FIT NEATLY INTO AN

12:05.825 --> 12:07.960
INSTAGRAM STORY.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.261
AND THAT'S NOT AN OUTLIER.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.696
OVERALL, IT'S COMMON FOR BAIL

12:10.696 --> 12:11.964
HEARINGS TO LAST ONLY A FEW

12:11.964 --> 12:13.466
MINUTES, WITH NO DEFENSE COUNSEL

12:13.466 --> 12:15.134
PRESENT.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.769
AND THEY CAN BE CONDUCTED WITH

12:16.769 --> 12:17.336
INCREDIBLE PETTINESS.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.038
JUST WATCH THIS HEARING FROM

12:19.038 --> 12:20.573
2016, IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS,

12:20.573 --> 12:21.907
WHERE A WOMAN HAD BEEN CHARGED

12:21.907 --> 12:23.375
WITH A MISDEMEANOR OF POSSESSING

12:23.375 --> 12:25.644
LESS THAN TWO OUNCES OF

12:25.644 --> 12:26.545
MARIJUANA.

12:26.545 --> 12:27.446
THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.048
BOND IS $1000.

12:29.048 --> 12:30.883
ARE YOU REQUESTING A COURT

12:30.883 --> 12:32.885
APPOINTED LAWYER?

12:32.885 --> 12:35.154
I GUESS, SURE.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.956
GIVE ME A "YES" OR "NO."

12:36.956 --> 12:38.557
YEAH.

12:38.557 --> 12:40.126
GIVE ME A "YES" OR "NO."

12:40.126 --> 12:41.560
YEAH.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.429
I ASKED A QUESTION THAT CALLS

12:43.429 --> 12:44.597
FOR A "YES" OR A "NO," I DON'T

12:44.597 --> 12:45.231
EXPECT ANYTHING BUT A "YES" OR A

12:45.231 --> 12:46.532
"NO."

12:46.532 --> 12:48.067
NOT A MM-HMM, MAYBE SO, OR A

12:48.067 --> 12:48.601
YELL, OR ANYTHING ELSE--

12:48.601 --> 12:49.869
I SAID "YEAH."

12:49.869 --> 12:50.503
OR SOMETHING-- I HEARD WHAT

12:50.503 --> 12:51.370
YOU SAID.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.472
YOUR BOND JUST WENT UP TO $2000.

12:53.472 --> 13:00.779
WOW.

13:00.779 --> 13:01.447
FIRST, FUCK OFF ALL THE WAY OFF.

13:01.447 --> 13:01.981
SECOND, "YEAH" MEANS YES.

13:01.981 --> 13:02.581
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE GAVE YOU A

13:02.581 --> 13:03.048
THUMBS UP AND WINKED.

13:03.048 --> 13:03.682
YOU KNEW WHAT SHE MEANT AND YOU

13:03.682 --> 13:04.817
JUST WANTED TO BE A DICK.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.519
AND IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD WHATEVER

13:06.519 --> 13:08.888
BAIL A SASSY JUDGE FELT LIKE

13:08.888 --> 13:10.322
DISHING OUT, YOU MIGHT BE FORCED

13:10.322 --> 13:11.157
TO TURN TO A BAIL BONDSMAN.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.058
THE WAY THEIR BUSINESS WORKS IS,

13:13.058 --> 13:14.293
THEY'LL POST YOUR BAIL FOR YOU,

13:14.293 --> 13:15.761
IN EXCHANGE FOR A FEE THAT'S

13:15.761 --> 13:17.163
NORMALLY AROUND TEN PERCENT OF

13:17.163 --> 13:18.297
IT-- MONEY, BY THE WAY, YOU

13:18.297 --> 13:20.099
DON'T GET BACK, NO MATTER WHAT

13:20.099 --> 13:21.734
THE OUTCOME OF YOUR CASE.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.068
IT'S A LUCRATIVE BUSINESS, WHICH

13:23.068 --> 13:25.304
RAKES IN ABOUT "$2 BILLION

13:25.304 --> 13:25.938
DOLLARS" PER YEAR, ALMOST NONE

13:25.938 --> 13:27.106
OF WHICH GOES INTO THEIR

13:32.912 --> 13:33.379
POLICE ARE ON MY TAIL.

13:33.379 --> 13:33.946
LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO THE

13:33.946 --> 13:35.281
COUNTY JAIL.

13:35.281 --> 13:36.849
GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO, CALL

13:42.388 --> 13:44.156
OUT WITH A CALL ON THE PHONE AND

13:44.156 --> 13:45.391
BEFORE I EVEN KNEW IT I WAS FREE

13:45.391 --> 13:48.160
TO ROAM.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.628
LIPSTICK BAIL BONDS!

13:49.628 --> 13:52.731
KISS JAIL GOODBYE!

13:52.731 --> 13:53.966

13:53.966 --> 13:55.267
DIRECTION I WOULD'VE TAKEN FOR

13:55.267 --> 13:56.602
THE BARBIE MOVIE, BUT I TRUST

13:56.602 --> 13:58.437
GRETA GERWIG'S VISION.

14:14.787 --> 14:19.425
THAT SITUATION, WHICH HAS LED TO

14:19.425 --> 14:20.326
A TRULY STAGGERING STATISTIC.

14:20.326 --> 14:20.960
THIS GRAPH SHOWS LOCAL JAIL

14:20.960 --> 14:22.361
INMATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.796
IN THE PAST 20 YEARS, THAT

14:23.796 --> 14:25.397
POPULATION HAS SHOT WAY UP, AND

14:25.397 --> 14:26.799
THERE'S SOMETHING SURPRISING

14:26.799 --> 14:28.400
ABOUT THAT RISE.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.502
YOU CAN SEE IT ONLY IF YOU LOOK

14:30.502 --> 14:32.771
AT INMATES WITH CONVICTIONS.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.406
AROUND 1999 THAT POPULATION

14:34.406 --> 14:36.075
LEVELED OFF, MEANING MOST OF THE

14:36.075 --> 14:37.843
RISE CAME FROM THIS GROUP.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.812
NON-CONVICTED PRISONERS.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.347
EVERY DAY IN THE U.S. NEARLY

14:41.347 --> 14:43.649
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE SITTING IN

14:43.649 --> 14:45.251
LOCAL JAILS HAVEN'T BEEN

14:45.251 --> 14:46.719
CONVICTED OF ANYTHING.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.853
IT'S TRUE.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.321
IN FACT, RIGHT NOW, ROUGHLY

14:49.321 --> 14:50.522
TWO-THIRDS OF OUR JAIL

14:50.522 --> 14:52.024
POPULATION ON ANY GIVEN DAY ARE

14:52.024 --> 14:53.125
PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN

14:53.125 --> 14:54.260
CONVICTED OF A CRIME.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.594
AND MOST OF THEM ARE THERE,

14:55.594 --> 14:56.328
BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T

14:56.328 --> 14:56.929
AFFORD TO BAIL THEMSELVES OUT.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.831
WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.099
WE SHOULDN'T HOLD PEOPLE CAPTIVE

15:00.099 --> 15:01.433
IN SHITTY CONDITIONS SIMPLY

15:01.433 --> 15:03.902
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BUY THEIR WAY

15:03.902 --> 15:05.804
OUT, THAT'S WHAT SPIRIT AIRLINES

15:05.804 --> 15:07.573
IS FOR.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.475
WHAT ALL THIS MEANS IS THAT A

15:09.475 --> 15:10.276
SIMPLE ARREST-- EVEN FOR A

15:10.276 --> 15:12.077
CRIME YOU DIDN'T COMMIT-- CAN

15:12.077 --> 15:13.279
DESTROY YOUR LIFE.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.713
BECAUSE EVEN A SHORT AMOUNT OF

15:14.713 --> 15:17.149
TIME IN JAIL CAN TURN IT UPSIDE

15:17.149 --> 15:19.151
DOWN.

15:19.151 --> 15:19.685
AND IT'S OFTEN NOT A SHORT

15:19.685 --> 15:20.619
AMOUNT OF TIME.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.454
TAKE MARVIN MAYFIELD.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.023
HE WAS ARRESTED FOR A BURGLARY

15:24.023 --> 15:25.991
HE INSISTS HE DIDN'T COMMIT, AND

15:25.991 --> 15:26.659
GOT STUCK IN RIKERS FOR NEARLY A

15:26.659 --> 15:28.093
YEAR.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.428
BEFORE YOU WENT IN, YOU--

15:29.428 --> 15:30.963
YOU HAD STARTED A JOB--

15:30.963 --> 15:31.864
MM-HM, HAD A CAR.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.365
YOU HAD SECURED IN A-- A

15:33.365 --> 15:33.999
PLACE, YOU HAD A CAR.

15:33.999 --> 15:34.700
RIGHT.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.168
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF IT?

15:36.168 --> 15:37.636
ALL OF THOSE THINGS, MY JOB,

15:37.636 --> 15:39.338
MY CAR, AND MY PLACE, WERE ALL

15:39.338 --> 15:40.339
GONE AFTER 11 MONTHS.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.141
I COULDN'T HOLD ON TO IT.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.709
YEAH, HE WAS IN THERE

15:43.709 --> 15:45.277
FOR 11 MONTHS.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.712
AND OBVIOUSLY, NO JOB IS COOL

15:46.712 --> 15:48.380
WITH YOU JUST NOT SHOWING UP FOR

15:48.380 --> 15:49.515
ELEVEN MONTHS, UNLESS, OF

15:49.515 --> 15:52.418
COURSE, YOU'RE THIS LAZY BITCH.

15:52.418 --> 15:53.752
AND ALL THIS IS BEFORE YOU GET

15:53.752 --> 15:55.454
TO THE FACT THAT HOLDING SOMEONE

15:55.454 --> 15:56.989
PRETRIAL CAN GIVE A PROSECUTOR A

15:56.989 --> 15:58.390
HUGE AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE IN

15:58.390 --> 16:00.192
OBTAINING A GUILTY PLEA.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.660
AGAIN, MARVIN MAYFIELD MAINTAINS

16:01.660 --> 16:03.595
HE WAS INNOCENT, BUT HE PLED

16:03.595 --> 16:05.531
GUILTY ANYWAY, AND WHEN YOU HEAR

16:05.531 --> 16:08.200
HIM EXPLAIN WHY, IT MAKES SENSE.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.935
AFTER 11 MONTHS, THEY SAID

16:09.935 --> 16:12.071
THAT IF YOU PLEAD GUILTY TODAY,

16:12.071 --> 16:13.706
YOU GET TIME SERVED AND GO HOME.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.541
SO, YOUR OPTION WAS TO STAY

16:15.541 --> 16:16.675
IN AND-- AND FIGHT THIS CASE--

16:16.675 --> 16:17.543
MMM-HM.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.111
OR YOU CAN GO HOME TODAY.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.813
OR I CAN GO HOME TODAY.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.848
BUT ANOTHER GUILTY PLEA, ANOTHER

16:22.848 --> 16:23.449
GUILTY PLEA TO A FELONY ON MY

16:23.449 --> 16:24.950
RECORD.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.820
THE WORST AND HARDEST BLOW OF

16:27.820 --> 16:28.787
EVERYTHING WAS TO PLEAD GUILTY

16:28.787 --> 16:30.356
TO SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO JUST TO

16:30.356 --> 16:33.659
STOP THAT SUFFERING.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.259
AND I GET THAT.

16:34.259 --> 16:35.994
IF I'D BEEN HELD IN RIKERS FOR

16:35.994 --> 16:36.829
11 MONTHS WITH NO TRIAL AND NO

16:36.829 --> 16:38.697
END IN SIGHT, I'D CONFESS TO

16:38.697 --> 16:39.732
ANYTHING IF IT MEANT GOING HOME.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.699
LINDBERGH BABY?

16:40.699 --> 16:41.433
SNATCHED IT.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.334
JFK?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.168
CAPPED HIM.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.036
ZODIAC KILLER?

16:44.036 --> 16:46.605
IT ME.

16:46.605 --> 16:47.806
JUST PLEASE LET ME GO HOME.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.074
AND YES, I CAN SEE IT, TOO.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.309
THERE IS A RESEMBLANCE.

16:50.309 --> 16:51.176
EXCEPT I'M KIDDING, I LOOK

16:51.176 --> 16:52.578
NOTHING LIKE THE ZODIAC KILLER.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.046
AND YOU'LL AGREE WITH THAT IF

16:54.046 --> 16:57.950
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.551
SO CASH BAIL IS ARBITRARY,

16:59.551 --> 17:01.920
DESTRUCTIVE, AND BASICALLY

17:01.920 --> 17:02.488
CRIMINALIZES POVERTY-- AND

17:02.488 --> 17:03.722
THAT'S WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE

17:03.722 --> 17:04.256
MASSIVE RACIAL DISPARITIES

17:04.256 --> 17:05.991
INVOLVED.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.359
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

17:07.359 --> 17:08.527
TOGETHER, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

17:08.527 --> 17:10.429
SO MANY JURISDICTIONS PASSED

17:10.429 --> 17:11.797
SOME FORM OF BAIL REFORM OVER

17:11.797 --> 17:13.298
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.101
AND NOTABLY, IN SOME PLACES, IT

17:16.101 --> 17:17.736
WAS DONE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT

17:17.736 --> 17:18.604
IN 2014, NEW JERSEY PASSED A

17:18.604 --> 17:20.472
BILL THAT'S SINCE CUT THE NUMBER

17:20.472 --> 17:22.541
OF PEOPLE IN ITS JAILS BY HALF,

17:22.541 --> 17:24.376
AND IT WAS CHAMPIONED BY A

17:24.376 --> 17:25.911
SURPRISING FIGURE.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.546
NO LONGER MUST YOU STAY IN

17:27.546 --> 17:29.114
JAIL FOR MINOR OFFENSES, LONGER

17:29.114 --> 17:31.550
THAN YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU'D

17:31.550 --> 17:33.485
ACTUALLY BEEN CONVICTED OF THE

17:33.485 --> 17:34.753
CRIME WHICH YOU'RE ACCUSED OF

17:34.753 --> 17:36.121
COMMITTING, JUST BECAUSE YOUR

17:36.121 --> 17:37.890
FAMILY DOESN'T HAVE $500 TO POST

17:37.890 --> 17:38.924
BAIL.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.360
YEAH, TO HIS CREDIT,

17:41.360 --> 17:42.361
CHRIS CHRISTIE SUPPORTED BAIL

17:42.361 --> 17:43.695
REFORM.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.364
AND REMEMBER, THIS IS THE SAME

17:45.364 --> 17:46.098
CHRIS CHRISTIE WHO THOUGHT IT

17:46.098 --> 17:46.865
WAS A GOOD IDEA TO BE

17:46.865 --> 17:48.133
"PRO-TRAFFIC JAM," GOT

17:48.133 --> 17:49.301
PHOTOGRAPHED ENJOYING A BEACH

17:49.301 --> 17:50.436
THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED TO THE

17:50.436 --> 17:52.337
PUBLIC BY A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN,

17:52.337 --> 17:53.839
AND WAS THE FIRST MAJOR

17:53.839 --> 17:54.573
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE TO ENDORSE

17:54.573 --> 17:56.008
THIS HISTORIC WHOOPSIE.

17:56.008 --> 17:56.975
THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY HAS TO

17:56.975 --> 17:58.544
BE PRETTY FUCKING OBVIOUS IF

17:58.544 --> 18:01.447
EVEN CHRIS CHRISTIE CAN FIND IT.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.815
AND YET, IN MANY PLACES, THE

18:02.815 --> 18:04.283
BACKLASH TO THESE REFORMS HAS

18:04.283 --> 18:05.684
BEEN SWIFT, AND UGLY.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.653
AND IT ALWAYS TAKES THE SAME

18:08.620 --> 18:09.955
FEARMONGERING ABOUT HOW

18:09.955 --> 18:11.590
REFORMING CASH BAIL MEANS

18:11.590 --> 18:13.258
VIOLENT CRIMINALS ARE GOING TO

18:13.258 --> 18:14.193
BE WANTONLY SET LOOSE ON THE

18:14.193 --> 18:15.494
STREETS TO REOFFEND.

18:15.494 --> 18:18.297
BUT EVERY PART OF THAT IS MUCH

18:18.297 --> 18:19.631
MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT SOUNDS.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.000
FOR STARTERS, A HUGE AMOUNT OF

18:22.000 --> 18:23.569
PEOPLE IN JAIL ARE STUCK THERE

18:23.569 --> 18:25.237
ON SIMPLE MISDEMEANORS OR

18:25.237 --> 18:26.205
NON-VIOLENT CHARGES.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.440
AND EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO

18:28.440 --> 18:29.708
VIOLENT FELONY CHARGES, THOSE

18:29.708 --> 18:31.410
HAPPEN ON A VERY BROAD SPECTRUM

18:31.410 --> 18:33.545
FROM MURDER TO SIMPLY BEING

18:33.545 --> 18:35.314
INVOLVED IN A FIGHT.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.348
AND IMPORTANTLY, BEING CHARGED

18:36.348 --> 18:37.583
WITH SOMETHING DOESN'T

18:37.583 --> 18:39.718
NECESSARILY MEAN YOU'RE GUILTY

18:39.718 --> 18:41.386
THAT'S FOR A TRIAL TO DECIDE.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.821
YET, TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE ONLY

18:42.821 --> 18:44.823
TOO HAPPY TO BLUR THE LINE

18:44.823 --> 18:45.257
BETWEEN "CHARGE" AND

18:45.257 --> 18:47.159
"CONVICTION."

18:47.159 --> 18:48.327
EARLIER THIS YEAR, CHICAGO MAYOR

18:48.327 --> 18:50.395
LORI LIGHTFOOT DID EXACTLY THAT,

18:50.395 --> 18:51.997
WHEN CRITICIZING PRETRIAL

18:51.997 --> 18:53.932
RELEASE PROGRAMS IN COOK COUNTY,

18:53.932 --> 18:57.002
WHICH IMPLEMENTED ITS BAIL

18:57.002 --> 18:57.569
REFORMS BACK IN 2017.

18:57.569 --> 18:58.537
THE MAYOR SAYING JUDGES

18:58.537 --> 19:00.506
SHOULD NOT ALLOW PEOPLE CHARGED

19:00.506 --> 19:01.740
WITH VIOLENT CRIMES TO WALK FREE

19:01.740 --> 19:03.509
ON BAIL OR ELECTRONIC

19:03.509 --> 19:04.643
MONITORING, BECAUSE IF THEY'RE

19:04.643 --> 19:06.945
CHARGED, THEY'RE GUILTY.

19:06.945 --> 19:07.980
WHEN THOSE CASE-- CHARGES

19:07.980 --> 19:09.348
ARE BROUGHT, THESE PEOPLE ARE

19:09.348 --> 19:11.817
GUILTY.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.085
AND OF COURSE, THEY'RE ENTITLED

19:13.085 --> 19:14.253
TO A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE,

19:14.253 --> 19:16.021
OF COURSE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO

19:16.021 --> 19:18.390
THEIR DAY IN COURT, BUT

19:18.390 --> 19:19.525
RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE

19:19.525 --> 19:21.627
ALSO ENTITLED TO SAFETY.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.262
WAIT, HOLD ON.

19:23.262 --> 19:26.031
YOU CAN'T SAY SOMEONE'S GUILTY

19:26.031 --> 19:26.732
AND THEN SAY THEY'RE ENTITLED

19:26.732 --> 19:27.933
TO A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.536
THOSE TWO IDEAS CANNOT COEXIST.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.604
YOU CAN'T BE GUILTY AND INNOCENT

19:32.604 --> 19:33.572
AT THE SAME TIME JUST LIKE YOU

19:33.572 --> 19:35.507
CAN'T BE HUNGRY AND FULL OR TALL

19:35.507 --> 19:37.676
AND SHORT OR BRITISH AND HAPPY.

19:37.676 --> 19:42.314
IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER!

19:42.314 --> 19:42.881
BELIEVE ME!

19:42.881 --> 19:44.249
AND ILLINOIS' BAIL CONVERSATION

19:44.249 --> 19:45.350
HAS ONLY GOTTEN MORE HEATED, NOW

19:45.350 --> 19:47.319
A STATEWIDE LAW ELIMINATING THE

19:47.319 --> 19:48.954
USE OF CASH BAIL IS SET TO TAKE

19:48.954 --> 19:50.355
EFFECT IN JANUARY.

19:50.355 --> 19:50.989
REPUBLICANS HAVE CALLED IT "THE

19:50.989 --> 19:53.025
PURGE" LAW, AND HAVE ATTACKED IT

19:53.025 --> 19:55.093
IN SOME PRETTY GROSS WAYS,

19:55.093 --> 19:57.095
INCLUDING THESE UNUSUAL MAILERS

19:57.095 --> 19:58.764
TO VOTERS.

19:58.764 --> 19:59.565
THE PAPERS, THEY'VE BEEN

19:59.565 --> 20:00.866
DELIVERED UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES,

20:00.866 --> 20:02.568
THIS ONE THE CHICAGO CITY WIRE.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.636
THEY ALL CLAIM TO HAVE REAL DATA

20:04.636 --> 20:06.838
AND REAL NEWS, BUT IT'S ALSO A

20:06.838 --> 20:08.273
CAMPAIGN MESSAGE, NOT A REAL

20:08.273 --> 20:09.708
NEWSPAPER.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.143
THERE ARE TWO PAGES OF PHOTOS

20:11.143 --> 20:13.879
OF MEN, MOSTLY BLACK AND LATINO,

20:13.879 --> 20:15.080
WHO, ACCORDING TO THE PAPER,

20:15.080 --> 20:17.482
WILL BE RELEASED ON BOND IN

20:17.482 --> 20:18.417
DUPAGE COUNTY.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.018
THE CONTROVERSIAL

20:20.018 --> 20:21.320
NEWSPAPER-LIKE MAILINGS ARE FROM

20:21.320 --> 20:23.188
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST DAN PROFT

20:23.188 --> 20:25.324
WHO RUNS THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY BY

20:25.324 --> 20:26.425
THE RULES PAC.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.459
WOW.

20:27.459 --> 20:27.993
FIRST, THAT IS STRIKINGLY

20:27.993 --> 20:29.661
RACIST.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.796
AND SECOND, THOSE MAILERS WERE

20:30.796 --> 20:33.365
ABSOLUTE HORSESHIT.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.800
THEY STATED THE NEW LAW

20:34.800 --> 20:35.334
"MANDATES" MURDER SUSPECTS

20:35.334 --> 20:36.735
AWAITING TRIAL BE RELEASED FROM

20:36.735 --> 20:38.770
JAIL, WHICH IT DOESN'T.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.405
THEY ALSO FEATURED A LIST OF

20:40.405 --> 20:41.039
CHARGES THAT THEY CLAIMED WERE

20:41.039 --> 20:42.274
"NON-DETAINABLE."

20:42.274 --> 20:43.842
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT IN

20:43.842 --> 20:45.477
ILLINOIS, AS IN MOST PLACES THAT

20:45.477 --> 20:46.678
HAVE PASSED BAIL REFORM-- FOR

20:46.678 --> 20:48.880
SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES,

20:48.880 --> 20:51.283
SUSPECTS CAN STILL BE JAILED

20:51.283 --> 20:52.951
PRETRIAL IF THEY'RE CONSIDERED

20:52.951 --> 20:54.353
A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK, OR LIKELY

20:54.353 --> 20:57.456
TO FLEE.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.190
SO THOSE CLAIMS WERE BASICALLY

20:58.190 --> 20:59.691
THE MOST MISLEADING THING TO

20:59.691 --> 21:00.626
APPEAR IN NEWSPRINT SINCE THE

21:00.626 --> 21:01.193
IDEA THAT DAGWOOD COULD PULL

21:01.193 --> 21:01.727
BLONDIE.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.128
COME ON.

21:03.128 --> 21:05.230
LOOK AT HIM, THEN LOOK AT HER.

21:05.230 --> 21:06.999
THERE'S NO WAY.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.433
SHE'S A STONE COLD TEN AND

21:08.433 --> 21:09.334
DAGWOOD'S NOT EVEN A CATCH BY

21:09.334 --> 21:16.174
"FUNNY PAGES" STANDARDS.

21:16.174 --> 21:16.842
SHE MARRIED DOWN.

21:16.842 --> 21:17.509
AND TO SEE JUST HOW SUCCESSFULLY

21:17.509 --> 21:18.143
BAIL REFORM OPPONENTS CAN

21:18.143 --> 21:21.246
DEMAGOGUE THIS ISSUE, JUST LOOK

21:21.246 --> 21:21.647
HERE IN NEW YORK.

21:21.647 --> 21:22.247
THE BIG KOO-KOO CITY THAT GO

21:22.247 --> 21:24.616
HONK HONK.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.717
THIS STATE'S BAIL REFORM LAW

21:25.717 --> 21:27.953
TOOK EFFECT ON NEW YEAR'S DAY OF

21:27.953 --> 21:29.788
2020, AND JUST EIGHT DAYS LATER

21:29.788 --> 21:31.089
LONG BEFORE THERE WAS ANY

21:31.089 --> 21:33.492
DATA ON ITS IMPACTS-- STATE

21:33.492 --> 21:34.359
LEGISLATORS WERE OUT THERE

21:34.359 --> 21:35.694
TRYING TO GET IT REPEALED.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.429
I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING

21:37.429 --> 21:39.064
SCARED, I THINK PEOPLE ARE

21:39.064 --> 21:40.332
FEELING UNSAFE AND MORE UNSAFE

21:40.332 --> 21:41.466
AS EACH DAY GOES BY.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.368
WE'RE GOING TO HAMMER THIS--

21:43.368 --> 21:44.169
I WANT TO BE CLEAR-- WE'RE

21:44.169 --> 21:46.438
GOING TO HAMMER THIS EVERY

21:46.438 --> 21:48.407
SINGLE DAY.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.042
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE

21:50.042 --> 21:51.209
THE POINT THIS IS WHAT THE

21:51.209 --> 21:53.045
PUBLIC CARES ABOUT.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.579
THAT WAS JUST EIGHT

21:54.579 --> 21:55.647
DAYS IN.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.149
SO UNLESS A TON OF PEOPLE CHOSE

21:57.149 --> 21:59.017
THE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION "BE

21:59.017 --> 22:01.620
SCARED OF BAIL REFORM," AND THEY

22:01.620 --> 22:03.155
ACTUALLY STUCK WITH IT PAST

22:03.155 --> 22:04.990
JANUARY 3RD-- TWO EQUALLY

22:04.990 --> 22:07.092
UNREALISTIC SCENARIOS-- I'M

22:07.092 --> 22:10.362
PRETTY SURE SUFFOLK COUNTY KYLE

22:10.362 --> 22:10.929
MACLACHLAN HERE IS HAMMERING

22:10.929 --> 22:11.997
AWAY AT THIN AIR.

22:11.997 --> 22:16.101
AND THE THING IS, VIOLENT CRIME

22:16.101 --> 22:16.868
DID RISE IN NEW YORK IN 2020--

22:16.868 --> 22:17.936
JUST LIKE IT DID EVERYWHERE ELSE

22:17.936 --> 22:19.171
IN AMERICA, BOTH IN PLACES THAT

22:19.171 --> 22:20.505
PASSED BAIL REFORM, AND IN

22:20.505 --> 22:21.907
PLACES THAT DIDN'T.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.009
AND YET, THE NYPD RELENTLESSLY

22:24.009 --> 22:26.478
LABELED BAIL REFORM THE CAUSE.

22:26.478 --> 22:27.546
ITS THEN-COMMISSIONER, DERMOT

22:27.546 --> 22:28.914
SHEA, REPEATEDLY TOOK TO THE

22:28.914 --> 22:30.348
PRESS TO LABEL IT A MAJOR REASON

22:30.348 --> 22:31.516
FOR INCREASES IN CRIME AND GUN

22:31.516 --> 22:33.452
VIOLENCE.

22:33.452 --> 22:34.853
BUT WHEN THE NEW YORK POST

22:34.853 --> 22:36.888
CHECKED THOSE CLAIMS, USING THE

22:36.888 --> 22:38.090
NYPD'S OWN DATA, THEY FOUND THAT

22:38.090 --> 22:39.224
IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2020,

22:39.224 --> 22:41.760
OUT OF 528 SHOOTING INCIDENTS,

22:41.760 --> 22:43.995
EXACTLY ONE HAD BEEN COMMITTED

22:43.995 --> 22:45.263
BY SOMEONE RELEASED UNDER BAIL

22:45.263 --> 22:46.198
REFORM.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.833
AND THAT WASN'T THE ONLY TIME

22:47.833 --> 22:48.467
SHEA WAS MISLEADING.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.435
HE ALSO WENT ON A LOCAL MORNING

22:50.435 --> 22:52.037
SHOW TO SUGGEST THE SUSPECT IN A

22:52.037 --> 22:54.239
PURSE SNATCHING WAS OUT ON BAIL.

22:54.239 --> 22:56.441
HE HAS 11 OPEN COURT CASES

22:56.441 --> 22:57.042
RIGHT NOW.

22:57.042 --> 23:01.113
THINK ABOUT THAT.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.047
HOW IS THIS ALLOWED TO-- HOW

23:02.047 --> 23:02.981
IS THIS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO

23:02.981 --> 23:05.417
FOSTER LIKE THIS?

23:05.417 --> 23:07.052
ONE SIDE WILL SAY AS LONG AS

23:07.052 --> 23:08.887
HE SHOWS UP AT COURT THEN

23:08.887 --> 23:11.490
EVERYTHING IS WORKING WELL AND I

23:11.490 --> 23:13.425
WOULD-- I WOULD SAY THAT

23:13.425 --> 23:14.559
EVERYTHING IS NOT WORKING WELL.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.027
11 OPEN COURT CASES IS

23:16.027 --> 23:17.829
SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO

23:17.829 --> 23:18.697
DEAL WITH, SOMEONE YOU WOULDN'T

23:18.697 --> 23:19.197
WANT TO ENCOUNTER ON THE

23:19.197 --> 23:20.165
STREETS.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.100
NOW THAT MIGHT SOUND

23:22.100 --> 23:22.400
SCARY.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.268
BUT I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS,

23:23.268 --> 23:24.636
THEY FOUND THAT GUY WITH 11 OPEN

23:24.636 --> 23:25.737
CASES.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.072
IT WAS PRETTY EASY, BECAUSE IT

23:27.072 --> 23:28.640
TURNS OUT, HE WAS ALREADY LOCKED

23:28.640 --> 23:29.841
UP IN RIKERS AT THE TIME THE

23:29.841 --> 23:31.076
CRIME TOOK PLACE.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.544
SO SHEA ACCUSED THE WRONG GUY

23:32.544 --> 23:33.245
ENTIRELY.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.613
BUT I'M SURE NEW YORK SLEPT MUCH

23:34.613 --> 23:36.648
SAFER KNOWING THAT THAT GUY WAS

23:36.648 --> 23:38.083
SAFELY BEHIND THE SAME BARS HE

23:38.083 --> 23:40.786
WAS ALREADY BEHIND BEFORE.

23:40.786 --> 23:43.155
JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THAT, SHEA

23:43.155 --> 23:44.189
HAD TO APPEAR BEFORE THE STATE

23:44.189 --> 23:44.656
LEGISLATURE.

23:44.656 --> 23:46.324
AND INTERESTINGLY, ALL THE

23:46.324 --> 23:48.460
FEARMONGERING AND BLUSTER HE'D

23:48.460 --> 23:49.828
SPREAD ON NEWSPAPERS AND TV

23:49.828 --> 23:51.696
COMPLETELY COLLAPSED IN A FORUM

23:51.696 --> 23:53.365
WHERE HE WAS EXPECTED TO ANSWER

23:53.365 --> 23:56.134
HONESTLY.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.303
WERE THERE PEOPLE OUT WHO--

23:58.303 --> 23:59.471
WHO, YOU KNOW, WITH NO BAIL FOR

23:59.471 --> 24:01.506
EXAMPLE OR BAIL BEING SET AND

24:01.506 --> 24:02.908
THEY MADE BAIL-- I DON'T KNOW

24:02.908 --> 24:04.776
AND THEN COMMITTED ANOTHER

24:04.776 --> 24:06.645
SHOOTING AND WERE ARRESTED AGAIN

24:06.645 --> 24:08.046
FOR BASICALLY THE SAME CRIME?

24:08.046 --> 24:09.481
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO WE

24:09.481 --> 24:10.782
ARREST FOR CRIMES, IT'S GOING TO

24:10.782 --> 24:11.683
BE SMALL NUMBERS.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.785
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRETY OF

24:13.785 --> 24:15.153
HOW MANY SHOOTING ARRESTS WE

24:15.153 --> 24:17.189
MAKE AND THE PERCENTAGE, IT'S

24:17.189 --> 24:18.890
NOT DRAMATIC.

24:18.890 --> 24:19.724
I'M SORRY-- "THE

24:19.724 --> 24:22.060
PERCENTAGE IS NOT DRAMATIC?"

24:22.060 --> 24:23.328
YOU WERE CONSTANTLY CLAIMING

24:23.328 --> 24:24.296
BAIL REFORM WAS DRIVING UP

24:24.296 --> 24:24.963
SHOOTINGS.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.398
THERE ARE HERMITS ON

24:26.398 --> 24:27.432
MOUNTAINTOPS WHO KNOW EXACTLY

24:27.432 --> 24:29.734
ALL OF REALITY IS

24:29.734 --> 24:31.069
BUT THE BRIEF DANCE OF LIGHT

24:31.069 --> 24:32.571
ACROSS THE WATER'S SURFACE, AND

24:32.571 --> 24:35.106
DERMOT SHEA SAYS BAIL REFORM IS

24:35.106 --> 24:36.575
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RISE IN

24:36.575 --> 24:37.676
CRIME IN NEW YORK.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.811
YOU'D THINK HE'D BE EMBARRASSED

24:39.811 --> 24:40.812
BY BEING FORCED TO ADMIT "THE

24:40.812 --> 24:41.980
PERCENTAGE IS NOT DRAMATIC."

24:41.980 --> 24:44.282
BUT JUST TWO MONTHS LATER, HE

24:44.282 --> 24:46.651
WAS BACK ON TV, SAYING THIS.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.887
IS BAIL REFORM WHAT'S LEADING

24:48.887 --> 24:51.356
TO MORE SHOOTINGS--

24:51.356 --> 24:52.791
100%.

24:52.791 --> 24:56.795
AND MORE GUN POSSESSIONS

24:56.795 --> 24:59.197
HAPPENING ON THE STREETS--

24:59.197 --> 25:03.768
100%.

25:03.768 --> 25:04.169
THERE IS NO DOUBT.

25:04.169 --> 25:04.736
WELL, WHICH IS IT,

25:04.736 --> 25:04.970
DERMOT?

25:04.970 --> 25:05.604
ARE THE NUMBERS "NOT DRAMATIC?"

25:05.604 --> 25:06.238
OR IS BAIL REFORM "100 PERCENT"

25:06.238 --> 25:06.771
LEADING TO MORE SHOOTINGS?

25:06.771 --> 25:07.272
BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE

25:07.272 --> 25:07.706
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

25:07.706 --> 25:08.240
THE ONLY PLACE WHERE "NOT

25:08.240 --> 25:08.840
DRAMATIC" AND "100%" CAN EXIST

25:08.840 --> 25:10.976
AT THE SAME TIME IS IN KRISTEN

25:10.976 --> 25:12.577
STEWART'S WHOLE GENERAL VIBE.

25:12.577 --> 25:13.511
SHE'S GIVING IT HER ALL.

25:13.511 --> 25:14.379
BUT SHE'S ALSO GIVING US

25:14.379 --> 25:20.518
NOTHING.

25:20.518 --> 25:20.986
IT'S TOTALLY AMAZING.

25:20.986 --> 25:21.620
AND THE PROBLEM IS, ALL OF THIS

25:21.620 --> 25:22.320
THE EXAGGERATED CLAIMS AND

25:22.320 --> 25:23.355
SENSATIONAL HEADLINES-- HAVE

25:23.355 --> 25:23.889
MADE A REAL IMPRESSION ON

25:23.889 --> 25:25.490
PEOPLE.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.292
PUBLIC APPROVAL OF BAIL REFORM

25:27.292 --> 25:28.426
IN THIS STATE HAS PLUMMETED, AND

25:28.426 --> 25:29.394
THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS NOW

25:29.394 --> 25:30.262
ROLLED BACK PORTIONS OF THE LAW,

25:30.262 --> 25:31.263
TWICE.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.899
AND THAT'S THE THING.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.100
IT'S HARD TO OVERCOME THE

25:35.100 --> 25:36.401
EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THE CLAIM

25:36.401 --> 25:37.335
THAT BAIL REFORM HARMS PUBLIC

25:37.335 --> 25:38.303
SAFETY.

25:38.303 --> 25:39.671
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU

25:39.671 --> 25:41.973
CAN'T FIND ISOLATED INSTANCES OF

25:41.973 --> 25:43.541
INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN

25:43.541 --> 25:44.676
REARRESTED FOR NEW CRIMES WHILE

25:44.676 --> 25:45.744
OUT AWAITING TRIAL.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.812
YOU CAN.

25:47.812 --> 25:48.880
AND ANYTIME SOMEONE'S A VICTIM

25:48.880 --> 25:50.415
OF A CRIME, THAT IS TERRIBLE.

25:50.415 --> 25:52.684
BUT IF PUBLIC SAFETY IS

25:52.684 --> 25:54.452
GENUINELY YOUR PRIORITY-- CASH

25:54.452 --> 25:55.854
BAIL HAS NEVER FUNDAMENTALLY

25:55.854 --> 25:58.723
BEEN ABOUT THAT.

25:58.723 --> 25:59.925
FOR ALL THE ADS CURRENTLY

25:59.925 --> 26:01.192
CLAIMING THAT "PEOPLE CHARGED

26:01.192 --> 26:02.928
WITH VIOLENT CRIMES ARE NOW

26:02.928 --> 26:04.896
WALKING THE STREETS"-- THEY

26:04.896 --> 26:06.531
ALWAYS WERE, AS LONG AS THEY HAD

26:06.531 --> 26:08.233
ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE BAIL.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.234
UNDER TOO MANY PLACES' CURRENT

26:09.234 --> 26:10.835
SYSTEMS, A PERSON FACING A

26:10.835 --> 26:12.804
MARIJUANA MISDEMEANOR WHO

26:12.804 --> 26:14.272
DOESN'T HAVE $2,000 IS GOING TO

26:14.272 --> 26:15.674
GET STUCK INSIDE JAIL.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.509
BUT A SERIAL SEX OFFENDER WHO

26:17.509 --> 26:19.277
MAKES-- HYPOTHETICALLY-- A

26:19.277 --> 26:20.712
MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK IN

26:20.712 --> 26:21.646
"FINDING NEVERLAND" RECEIPTS

26:21.646 --> 26:24.082
GETS TO STAY AT HOME.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.350
AND WHEN YOU PULL BACK AND LOOK

26:25.350 --> 26:26.251
AT THE OVERALL FIGURES OF

26:26.251 --> 26:27.852
WHETHER BAIL REFORM HAS ANY

26:27.852 --> 26:29.154
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT LINK

26:29.154 --> 26:30.455
TO CRIME, THE ANSWER-- SO FAR

26:30.455 --> 26:31.690
HAS BEEN PRETTY CONCLUSIVELY

26:31.690 --> 26:34.059
"NO."

26:34.059 --> 26:35.327
ONE ANALYSIS LOOKED AT STUDIES

26:35.327 --> 26:36.494
IN SEVEN DIFFERENT

26:36.494 --> 26:39.030
JURISDICTIONS, AND NONE OF THEM

26:39.030 --> 26:40.432
FOUND THAT BAIL REFORMS LEAD TO

26:40.432 --> 26:42.100
A MEANINGFUL INCREASE IN CRIME.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.602
AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS BAIL

26:44.602 --> 26:47.038
REFORM CAN ACTUALLY MAKE PEOPLE

26:47.038 --> 26:48.740
LESS LIKELY TO RE-OFFEND--

26:48.740 --> 26:49.975
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

26:49.975 --> 26:52.043
IF YOU DON'T UPEND PEOPLE'S

26:52.043 --> 26:55.180
LIVES BY NEEDLESSLY THROWING

26:55.180 --> 26:56.147
THEM IN JAIL PRE-TRIAL, THEY'RE

26:56.147 --> 26:56.715
IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO

26:56.715 --> 26:58.750
STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.851
IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS-- THE

26:59.851 --> 27:01.119
PLACE YOU SAW THAT DICKISH JUDGE

27:01.119 --> 27:02.120
EARLIER-- RESEARCHERS FOUND

27:02.120 --> 27:05.156
THAT, AFTER THEY DRASTICALLY

27:05.156 --> 27:05.690
REDUCED CASH BAIL IN THEIR

27:05.690 --> 27:11.396
MISDEMEANOR COURTS, THERE WAS

27:11.396 --> 27:11.796
ACTUALLY A 6%

27:11.796 --> 27:12.397
"DECREASE" IN NEW PROSECUTIONS

27:12.397 --> 27:12.998
OF PEOPLE OVER THE THREE YEARS

27:12.998 --> 27:13.498
FOLLOWING THEIR ARREST.

27:13.498 --> 27:16.167
SO IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYBODY.

27:16.167 --> 27:16.801
BUT I GET THAT THOSE STATS DON'T

27:16.801 --> 27:18.870
SOUND NEARLY AS FLASHY OVER

27:18.870 --> 27:23.441
FOOTAGE OF A CRIME SCENE.

27:23.441 --> 27:24.809
YOU CAN'T MAKE A CAMPAIGN AD

27:24.809 --> 27:25.276
THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS.

27:25.276 --> 27:26.611
DO YOU FEEL SAFE?

27:26.611 --> 27:27.512
YOU SHOULD.

27:27.512 --> 27:28.713
STUDY AFTER STUDY

27:28.713 --> 27:31.983
SHOWS BAIL REFORM DOES NOT

27:31.983 --> 27:38.223
IMPACT RISING CRIME, AND IN FACT

27:38.223 --> 27:38.857
CAN EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO REDUCE

27:38.857 --> 27:39.157
RECIDIVISM.

27:39.157 --> 27:39.591
AND THIS DEAD BODY?

27:39.591 --> 27:40.191
IT'S JUST 70 POUNDS OF HAM IN

27:40.191 --> 27:41.092
THE SHAPE OF MAN.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.260
YEAH, IT'S HONEST, BUT

27:42.260 --> 27:43.294
IT DOESN'T PACK QUITE THE SAME

27:43.294 --> 27:45.597
PUNCH.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.265
AND FOR ALL THE FEARS OF LETTING

27:47.265 --> 27:49.134
SOMEONE WHO'S A DANGER ONTO THE

27:49.134 --> 27:50.468
STREETS-- AGAIN, BAIL REFORM

27:50.468 --> 27:52.203
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY JUDGES'

27:52.203 --> 27:54.472
ABILITY TO DETAIN SOMEONE THEY

27:54.472 --> 27:57.375
BELIEVE TO BE A GENUINE THREAT.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.877
IN 49 STATES, ALL EXCEPT NEW

27:58.877 --> 28:00.545
YORK, JUDGES ARE ALLOWED TO

28:00.545 --> 28:02.714
CONSIDER BOTH RISK OF FAILURE TO

28:02.714 --> 28:04.082
APPEAR AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN

28:04.082 --> 28:05.016
PRETRIAL DECISIONS.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.951
AND EVEN IN NEW YORK, IT WAS

28:06.951 --> 28:08.953
GENERALLY ACCEPTED JUDGES DID IT

28:08.953 --> 28:10.522
ANYWAY, AS "POTENTIAL

28:10.522 --> 28:11.890
DANGEROUSNESS" HAS BEEN THE DE

28:11.890 --> 28:12.891
FACTO USE OF BAIL HERE FOR

28:12.891 --> 28:14.459
DECADES.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.027
AND REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN

28:16.027 --> 28:17.095
DISAGREE ON HOW EXACTLY TO MAKE

28:17.095 --> 28:18.930
THOSE DETERMINATIONS.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.565
ONE PLACE THAT SOME EXPERTS

28:20.565 --> 28:21.900
POINT TO AS A MODEL IS NEW

28:21.900 --> 28:22.667
JERSEY, WHOSE SYSTEM NOW LOOKS

28:22.667 --> 28:24.536
LIKE THIS.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.671
JUDGE SYBIL ELIAS IS WEIGHING

28:26.671 --> 28:28.139
WHETHER TO FREE OR DETAIN A MAN

28:28.139 --> 28:30.108
WHO APPEARS FROM THE COUNTY JAIL

28:30.108 --> 28:31.076
BY CLOSED-CIRCUIT.

28:31.076 --> 28:34.012
NOTICE THERE IS NO MENTION OF

28:34.012 --> 28:35.080
MONEY FOR BAIL BECAUSE THE NEW

28:35.080 --> 28:36.281
SYSTEM ELIMINATES THAT.

28:36.281 --> 28:38.516
INSTEAD, IT USES INFORMATION

28:38.516 --> 28:40.185
SUCH AS CONVICTIONS, NOT

28:40.185 --> 28:41.619
ARRESTS, NOT SOCIO-ECONOMIC

28:41.619 --> 28:43.054
FACTORS, PUNCHED INTO A

28:43.054 --> 28:44.355
COMPUTER.

28:44.355 --> 28:46.391
THE TRIAL COURT ADMINISTRATOR

28:46.391 --> 28:47.959
WILL GIVE EACH DEFENDANT A SCORE

28:47.959 --> 28:49.894
OF 1 TO 6 FOR RISK OF

28:49.894 --> 28:50.628
REOFFENDING AND RISK OF SKIPPING

28:50.628 --> 28:52.297
COURT.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.065
EVEN IF A DEFENDANT HAS A HIGH

28:54.065 --> 28:55.533
SCORE, PROSECUTORS MUST ASK FOR

28:55.533 --> 28:57.435
A DETENTION HEARING WITHIN THREE

28:57.435 --> 28:58.970
TO FIVE DAYS, AND MUST PRESENT

28:58.970 --> 29:01.272
CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO

29:01.272 --> 29:02.707
DETAIN SOMEONE.

29:02.707 --> 29:03.975
YEAH, THAT SEEMS PRETTY

29:03.975 --> 29:04.776
GOOD RIGHT?

29:04.776 --> 29:06.277
ALTHOUGH IT'S BY NO MEANS

29:06.277 --> 29:07.078
PERFECT.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.113
FOR ONE, ASSIGNING PEOPLE A

29:08.113 --> 29:09.314
"CRIME SCORE" SOUNDS LIKE

29:09.314 --> 29:11.382
SOMETHING ROBOCOP DOES RIGHT

29:11.382 --> 29:12.584
BEFORE HE PUNCHES YOU OUT A

29:12.584 --> 29:13.585
WINDOW.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.186
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING, COMPUTER

29:15.186 --> 29:16.254
ALGORITHMS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO

29:16.254 --> 29:18.490
BIAS THEMSELVES.

29:18.490 --> 29:19.190
ONE SUCH SYSTEM IN BROWARD

29:19.190 --> 29:20.425
COUNTY, FLORIDA, "WAS

29:20.425 --> 29:21.526
PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO FALSELY

29:21.526 --> 29:23.128
FLAG BLACK DEFENDANTS AS FUTURE

29:23.128 --> 29:25.930
CRIMINALS, WRONGLY LABELING THEM

29:25.930 --> 29:26.998
AT ALMOST TWICE THE RATE AS

29:26.998 --> 29:28.066
WHITE DEFENDANTS."

29:28.066 --> 29:28.833
IT WAS BASICALLY A RACIST

29:28.833 --> 29:30.034
COMPUTER.

29:30.034 --> 29:32.070
WHICH I REALIZE IS PROBABLY ELON

29:32.070 --> 29:34.906
MUSK'S NEXT BILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.341
AND NEW JERSEY'S APPROACH ISN'T

29:36.341 --> 29:48.753
THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN WORK.

29:48.753 --> 29:49.621
BAIL REFORM HAS LOOKED DIFFERENT

29:49.621 --> 29:50.722
IN HARRIS COUNTY, FOR EXAMPLE,

29:50.722 --> 29:52.123
HAS HAD SIMILAR SUCCESS WITHOUT

29:52.123 --> 29:54.592
ANY KIND OF COMPUTER SCORING, AS

29:54.592 --> 29:54.926
HAS NEW YORK.

29:54.926 --> 29:55.527
THE POINT IS, IF WE WANTED TO,

29:55.527 --> 29:56.060
THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO

29:56.060 --> 29:56.594
DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT TRULY

29:56.594 --> 29:57.162
PRIORITIZES "PUBLIC SAFETY."

29:57.162 --> 29:58.062
BUT IF YOU COUNT THE ACCUSED AS

29:58.062 --> 30:00.165
PART OF THE PUBLIC, WHICH YOU

30:00.165 --> 30:01.900
REALLY SHOULD, WE SHOULD BE

30:01.900 --> 30:02.934
CONSIDERING THEIR SAFETY, TOO.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.369
BECAUSE TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN

30:04.369 --> 30:07.672
WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED UP PRE-TRIAL.

30:07.672 --> 30:09.440
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU CAN

30:09.440 --> 30:10.041
LOSE YOUR JOB AND YOUR HOME.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.442
YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LIFE.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.179
AN INVESTIGATION OF OVER 500 U-S

30:14.179 --> 30:16.147
JAILS FOUND THAT BETWEEN 2008

30:16.147 --> 30:18.983
AND 2019, THEY SAW OVER 7,500

30:18.983 --> 30:20.385
INMATE DEATHS-- AND OF THOSE

30:20.385 --> 30:24.055
PEOPLE, NEARLY 5,000 WERE NEVER

30:24.055 --> 30:25.523
CONVICTED OF THE CHARGES ON

30:25.523 --> 30:26.724
WHICH THEY WERE BEING HELD.

30:26.724 --> 30:27.892
HERE IN NEW YORK, AT RIKERS,

30:27.892 --> 30:29.928
WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE HELD

30:29.928 --> 30:32.363
PRE-TRIAL, 17 PEOPLE HAVE DIED

30:32.363 --> 30:34.332
THIS YEAR, SO FAR.

30:34.332 --> 30:34.966
AND I KNOW THIS CONVERSATION

30:34.966 --> 30:35.767
GETS HEATED.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.302
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

30:37.302 --> 30:39.537
WHY BAIL REFORM WAS IMPORTANT TO

30:39.537 --> 30:41.072
BEGIN WITH.

30:41.072 --> 30:42.173
AND IN THINKING ABOUT THIS

30:42.173 --> 30:44.309
STORY, I'D LIKE TO SHARE

30:44.309 --> 30:45.843
SOMETHING THAT'S STUCK WITH ME.

30:45.843 --> 30:47.412
WHEN WE DID OUR BAIL SEGMENT

30:47.412 --> 30:48.680
SEVEN YEARS AGO, RIGHT UNTIL THE

30:48.680 --> 30:50.114
LAST MINUTE, WE WERE GOING TO

30:50.114 --> 30:50.615
INCLUDE A CLIP OF KALIEF

30:50.615 --> 30:52.283
BROWDER.

30:52.283 --> 30:52.917
IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HIS

30:52.917 --> 30:54.185
STORY, AT 16, HE WAS WRONGLY

30:54.185 --> 30:54.686
ARRESTED FOR STEALING A

30:54.686 --> 30:56.454
BACKPACK.

30:56.454 --> 30:57.989
THIS WAS THE CLIP WE WERE GOING

30:57.989 --> 30:58.923
TO USE.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.091
THE GUY COMES OUT OF NOWHERE,

31:00.091 --> 31:00.692
SAYS I ROBBED HIM.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.826
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW

31:01.826 --> 31:02.760
THEY'RE PUTTING THE CUFFS ON ME.

31:02.760 --> 31:03.928
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS DUDE.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.163
BROWDER'S FAMILY COULDN'T

31:05.163 --> 31:06.831
MAKE THE $10,000 BAIL ON THE

31:06.831 --> 31:08.333
ROBBERY CHARGES.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.300
MONTHS TURNED INTO YEARS.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.336
HE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE

31:11.336 --> 31:12.403
SEVERAL TIMES.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.405
IN JUNE HE WAS SUDDENLY FREED

31:14.405 --> 31:16.207
WITH NO EXPLANATION.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.909
NO APOLOGY, NO NOTHING. THEY

31:17.909 --> 31:19.177
JUST SAID 'OH, CASE DISMISSED.

31:19.177 --> 31:26.451
DON'T WORRY ABOUT NOTHING.'

31:26.451 --> 31:26.985
LIKE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T

31:26.985 --> 31:27.418
WORRY ABOUT NOTHING.

31:27.418 --> 31:28.052
Y'ALL JUST TOOK OVER 3 YEARS OF

31:28.052 --> 31:28.286
MY LIFE.

31:28.286 --> 31:28.853
I DIDN'T GET TO GO TO PROM,

31:28.853 --> 31:29.721
GRADUATION, NOTHING.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.488
IT WAS MISSED YEARS, I'M NEVER

31:30.488 --> 31:31.155
GONNA GET THOSE YEARS BACK.

31:31.155 --> 31:34.459
NEVER.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.661
NOW, WE PULLED THAT

31:36.661 --> 31:38.029
CLIP OUT JUST BEFORE TAPING,

31:38.029 --> 31:39.397
WHEN WE FOUND OUT HE'D KILLED

31:39.397 --> 31:41.032
HIMSELF THE NIGHT BEFORE.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.400
HIS DEATH ISN'T EVEN INCLUDED IN

31:42.400 --> 31:44.535
ANY OF THE TALLIES OF PEOPLE WHO

31:44.535 --> 31:45.637
WERE KILLED BY RIKERS, DESPITE

31:45.637 --> 31:47.071
THE FACT IT SURE FEELS LIKE IT

31:47.071 --> 31:48.172
SHOULD BE.

31:48.172 --> 31:49.674
THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF LOCKING

31:49.674 --> 31:51.009
SO MANY PEOPLE UP PRE-TRIAL IS

31:51.009 --> 31:52.677
ENORMOUS.

31:52.677 --> 31:54.379
TO DEFEND THIS SYSTEM IS TO

31:54.379 --> 31:55.580
DEFEND A PEOPLE-WRECKING

31:55.580 --> 31:57.482
MACHINE.

31:57.482 --> 32:00.251
SO, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

32:00.251 --> 32:01.452
WELL, IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL WE'RE

32:01.452 --> 32:02.287
GOING TO GO BACKWARDS.

32:02.287 --> 32:03.554
WHICH WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.556
AND I'D ARGUE ANY FUTURE SYSTEM

32:05.556 --> 32:07.125
SHOULD BE BUILT ON A FEW BASIC

32:07.125 --> 32:08.660
PRINCIPLES.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.194
FIRST, FOR SOMEONE CHARGED WITH

32:10.194 --> 32:11.663
A LOW-LEVEL OFFENSE, WE SHOULD

32:11.663 --> 32:12.697
PRIORITIZE LETTING THEM REMAIN

32:12.697 --> 32:14.799
FREE PRETRIAL, INSTEAD OF

32:14.799 --> 32:16.167
DEFAULTING TO KEEPING THEM IN

32:16.167 --> 32:17.635
JAIL.

32:17.635 --> 32:19.704
SECOND, WHENEVER ANY BAIL

32:19.704 --> 32:21.773
HEARINGS DO HAPPEN, THEY SHOULD

32:21.773 --> 32:22.940
BE LONGER THAN TEN SECONDS.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.909
I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THAT HAS

32:24.909 --> 32:26.778
TO BE SAID OUT LOUD.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.179
ALSO, PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE COUNSEL

32:28.179 --> 32:29.847
WITH THEM AT BAIL HEARINGS.

32:29.847 --> 32:31.249
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HAS TO BE

32:31.249 --> 32:32.450
SAID EITHER.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.052
AND FINALLY, IF SOMEONE IS

32:34.052 --> 32:35.620
DETAINED, WE SHOULD BE

32:35.620 --> 32:36.187
EXPEDITING THEIR TRIAL, SO

32:36.187 --> 32:37.288
THEY'RE NOT WAITING YEARS FOR A

32:37.288 --> 32:37.989
COURT DATE.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.258
AND I'M NOT SAYING REFORM IS

32:40.258 --> 32:42.293
EASY OR SIMPLE.

32:42.293 --> 32:43.728
THERE ARE GOING TO BE

32:43.728 --> 32:45.563
DISAGREEMENTS EVEN AMONG

32:45.563 --> 32:46.831
ADVOCATES ABOUT BEST PRACTICES

32:46.831 --> 32:47.665
HERE.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.834
BUT RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE

32:49.834 --> 32:50.902
THOSE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS

32:50.902 --> 32:52.637
BECAUSE ALL THE AIR IN THE ROOM

32:52.637 --> 32:54.339
IS BEING TAKEN UP BY BULLSHIT

32:54.339 --> 32:55.740
FEARMONGERING ADS, FAKE

32:55.740 --> 32:57.709
NEWSPAPERS, AND

32:57.709 --> 32:58.910
CONFIDENTLY-DELIVERED LIES FROM

32:58.910 --> 32:59.744
MEN IN UNIFORM.

32:59.744 --> 33:02.013
AND LOOK, EVEN AFTER

33:02.013 --> 33:03.381
CONVICTIONS, WE'RE CLEARLY

33:03.381 --> 33:04.415
LOCKING FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE UP

33:04.415 --> 33:05.583
IN THIS COUNTRY.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.851
BUT TO DO IT BEFORE THEY'VE EVEN

33:06.851 --> 33:09.454
BEEN CONVICTED OF ANYTHING IS

33:09.454 --> 33:11.322
PROOF THAT CIVIL LIBERTIES ONLY

33:11.322 --> 33:13.024
APPLY TANGIBLY TO THE PRIVILEGED

33:13.024 --> 33:13.858
FOR EVERYONE ELSE, THEY'RE

33:13.858 --> 33:16.561
ENTIRELY THEORETICAL.

33:16.561 --> 33:18.896
AND ANYONE EVEN TRYING TO DEFEND

33:18.896 --> 33:21.466
A SYSTEM LIKE THAT IS BASICALLY

33:21.466 --> 33:24.969
MORALLY BANKRUPT.

33:24.969 --> 33:25.503
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DERMOT?

33:25.503 --> 33:26.471
100%.

33:26.471 --> 33:28.406
THERE IS NO DOUBT.

33:28.406 --> 33:30.141
FOR ONCE, DERMOT, I

33:30.141 --> 33:31.409
CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU THERE!

33:31.409 --> 33:33.711
AND NOW THIS.

33:33.711 --> 33:38.116
AND NOW,

33:38.116 --> 33:39.384
ALL

33:39.384 --> 33:40.485
TAMRON HALL EDITION.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.286
FULL DISCLOSURE MY DAD WAS 25

33:42.286 --> 33:49.894
YEARS OLDER THAN MY MOM.

33:49.894 --> 33:52.130
AND GROWING UP PEOPLE WOULD

33:52.130 --> 33:52.764
THINK HE WAS MY GRANDAD.

33:52.764 --> 33:53.398
FULL DISCLOSURE, I CANNOT STAND

33:53.398 --> 33:55.600

34:01.739 --> 34:03.207
FULL DISCLOSURE, WE EAT TWO

34:03.207 --> 34:06.177
