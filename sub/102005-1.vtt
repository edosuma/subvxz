00:49.460 --> 00:54.800
July 15, 1991

01:49.270 --> 01:51.980
Satoru Ichijo

01:56.550 --> 02:00.780
And the defendant is ordered
to pay all legal costs.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.020
The explanation for this
verdict can be found

02:03.020 --> 02:04.720
in the report for this case.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.320
This court is
officially adjourned.

02:10.460 --> 02:12.630
Good afternoon,
I'm Miho Tachibana,

02:12.630 --> 02:14.930
reporting to you live
from the Tokyo Dome.

02:16.330 --> 02:19.430
The Satoru Ichijo at the Tokyo
Dome event is happening here,

02:19.440 --> 02:22.100
later this evening, and
already, there are crowds

02:22.100 --> 02:24.270
who are hoping to
be the first inside.

02:25.140 --> 02:26.370
Satoru?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.710
Have seen
the promotional ads

02:27.710 --> 02:29.240
- in the newspaper.
- Hmm.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.510
Chiaki, do you know him?

02:32.110 --> 02:33.550
Yeah, a bit.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.380
We went to the same college.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.720
Oh.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.050
As I'm sure you're all aware,

02:38.050 --> 02:39.920
the media coverage
of him and the growth

02:39.920 --> 02:42.390
of Taiyoukai has been
nonstop, to say the least.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.490
Oh, ho! I see you made it.

02:45.490 --> 02:46.760
Can I get
you something to drink?

02:46.760 --> 02:47.730
- Four beers, please.
- I'll be right back.

02:47.730 --> 02:48.960
Took your time getting here.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.370
- It's been a while.
- This is great.

02:51.370 --> 02:52.800
Our favorite watering hole.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.130
You got that right.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.870
It's good to see you
again, Hiratsuka.

02:56.870 --> 02:58.610
So you're a professor now?

02:58.610 --> 02:59.710
Not anytime soon.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.710
All I do is write my thesis

03:01.710 --> 03:03.910
and give lectures,
and that's it.

03:03.910 --> 03:05.750
Sounds like a lot of work.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.610
And you, Yamamoto, tell me,

03:07.620 --> 03:09.580
are you busy at the
Ministry of Finance?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.480
Oh yeah.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.420
You're a prosecutor,

03:13.420 --> 03:14.920
and you work for the
defense agency, huh?

03:14.920 --> 03:16.460
Sure do.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.230
Looks like we're all doing
okay in our career choices.

03:18.230 --> 03:19.060
Who would've guessed that?

03:20.730 --> 03:21.730
Here you go!

03:21.730 --> 03:22.830
- Ah, thank you.
- Pass it over.

03:24.030 --> 03:25.070
- Here.
- Here you go.

03:25.070 --> 03:26.500
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.700
All right then,
to our reunion.

03:28.700 --> 03:29.670
Yeah.

03:29.670 --> 03:30.940
Cheers!

03:30.940 --> 03:32.440
Not just
the spiritual world.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.440
He has written about
other subjects as well,

03:34.440 --> 03:36.010
like mindsets, theory of life-

03:39.420 --> 03:40.650
That's good.

03:40.650 --> 03:43.180
So I guess he's
not gonna show, huh?

03:44.820 --> 03:46.050
I don't think that he can.

03:46.060 --> 03:46.850
Tell
us about his career

03:46.860 --> 03:48.620
on the lecture circuit.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.020
Yes.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.360
Although Mr. Ichijo has
published many different books,

03:52.360 --> 03:53.660
he's well known as a lecturer

03:53.660 --> 03:56.130
and gives speaking
tours all over Japan.

03:56.130 --> 03:59.900
Of all people, who
would've guessed him.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.370
He just took off, didn't he?

04:02.370 --> 04:04.470
Completely out of our reach now.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.210
Attending the
event here today.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.580
This is by far the largest crowd

04:11.580 --> 04:14.620
that Mr. Ichijo has
ever given a lecture to.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.350
It will be interesting
to hear the message

04:16.350 --> 04:17.750
that he'll be giving
us all tonight,

04:17.750 --> 04:19.890
right here at the Tokyo Dome.

04:19.890 --> 04:21.820
It's really quite
a feat to be able

04:21.820 --> 04:23.820
to hold an event of this scale.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.930
You have to have
incredible drawing power

04:25.930 --> 04:27.390
to pull that off there.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.900
Mm-hmm.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.670
Mr. Ichijo is clearly a
man of enormous charisma,

04:31.670 --> 04:34.430
but what kind of people does
he seem to be attracting?

04:36.910 --> 04:37.800
Miss Tachibana?

04:40.240 --> 04:42.310
Miss Tachibana, will
you answer that?

04:43.350 --> 04:44.680
Huh? Uh, yes.

04:45.550 --> 04:46.450
I saw...

05:01.300 --> 05:04.300
To Ms. Chiaki Minase

05:20.900 --> 05:23.900
On the World of
Values in Hannah Arendt

05:45.010 --> 05:46.840
"My dearest,

05:46.840 --> 05:49.440
why don't we listen for
the voices of the wind?

05:51.280 --> 05:54.180
On a cold hill in Umegaoka,

05:54.180 --> 05:55.820
it blows from nowhere,

05:57.190 --> 05:59.720
telling me restlessly that
our love may go astray.

05:58.650 --> 06:03.610
Kawashima, Tokushima Prefecture

06:01.160 --> 06:03.960
Why don't we listen for
the voices of the wind?

06:05.860 --> 06:09.700
Yoshino River

06:11.580 --> 06:14.580
Hair Salone Ichijo

06:26.120 --> 06:29.920
Please, God,
may Satoru be successful.

06:35.590 --> 06:37.490
Ladies
and gentlemen,

06:37.490 --> 06:38.790
welcome to an evening with
Satoru Ichijo at the Tokyo Dome.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.030
Your attention, please, soon
we will start the event.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.240
- During the lecture-
- Oh, Mr. Hinata!

06:49.240 --> 06:50.140
- Mr. Hinata!
- Mr. Hinata!

06:50.140 --> 06:51.040
- Ah!
- This way!

06:51.040 --> 06:52.040
Miss Nakamura.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.710
Have a seat here.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.040
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

06:56.010 --> 06:56.910
Wow.

06:58.050 --> 06:58.980
It's been a long time.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.210
You haven't changed at all.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.380
Mia, you're so big now.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.320
- Yes.
- Middle school?

07:04.320 --> 07:05.220
No, I'm in high school.

07:11.430 --> 07:15.010
Toho Company Co., Ltd.
70th Anniversary Party

07:14.900 --> 07:16.300
Welcome.

07:16.300 --> 07:20.200
We are pleased to celebrate
the 70th anniversary

07:20.200 --> 07:22.400
since our foundation.

07:23.770 --> 07:27.040
And we owe all of it to
the hard work and devotion

07:27.040 --> 07:28.610
of every single employee.

07:28.610 --> 07:30.140
I thank you all.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.780
Because of each and
every one of you,

07:31.780 --> 07:36.520
our once small trading house
has become a very large one.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.790
We are now one of the top
seven in the world in sales.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.390
Now that we've reached
this major milestone,

07:43.390 --> 07:45.330
we can all be very proud.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.490
But rather than
rest on our laurels,

07:47.500 --> 07:50.260
we're going to continue
to grow and expand.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.100
Thank you very much.

07:58.340 --> 07:59.210
Thanks.

08:01.810 --> 08:02.710
Here you go.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.150
See you tomorrow. Bye.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.620
What did you think?

08:13.620 --> 08:15.560
It was great, wasn't it?

08:16.690 --> 08:18.490
He was even more
charismatic today.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.290
Let's come again.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.760
Absolutely.

08:58.570 --> 09:00.300
Mr. Satoru Ichijo,

09:01.940 --> 09:05.210
you're not the person
that I used to know.

Satoru Ichijo
Born on July 7, 1956

09:44.080 --> 09:47.110
Satoru, you were born

09:47.120 --> 09:49.780
in this humble
home in Kawashima.

09:51.290 --> 09:55.690
Who knew that one day the whole
world would know about you?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.630
I'm your mother,

09:59.630 --> 10:02.330
but even I never imagined that.

10:11.510 --> 10:15.410
God taught us that we
choose how to live our lives

10:15.410 --> 10:18.280
and that it's imperative
we choose a virtuous life

10:18.280 --> 10:19.650
of our own free will.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.510
You understand?

10:24.590 --> 10:26.590
Well, that will
be all for today.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.320
Thank you very
much for the lesson.

10:31.730 --> 10:33.690
Satoru, get your hat.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.830
It's chilly tonight.

10:37.830 --> 10:38.700
Come on.

10:50.310 --> 10:52.180
It's freezing.

11:03.390 --> 11:06.090
You were
such a mischievous boy.

11:06.090 --> 11:08.500
But once you started
elementary school,

11:08.500 --> 11:12.170
you spent hours studying,
to everyone's surprise.

11:13.540 --> 11:16.400
And you were always the
top student in your class.

11:18.870 --> 11:22.310
Still, you'd say, "I
have to study three times

11:22.310 --> 11:25.480
as much as everyone else."

11:25.480 --> 11:27.450
You were very disciplined.

11:27.450 --> 11:29.150
And you continued working hard.

11:58.650 --> 12:01.610
Hey, Satoru, don't
forget to eat this later.

12:02.620 --> 12:03.920
Thank you, Father.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.790
Good work.

12:13.430 --> 12:18.500
Satoru, I heard that you scored
the highest in the class.

12:19.030 --> 12:19.770
Yeah.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.940
But there are lots of
people all over Japan

12:22.940 --> 12:24.800
who are at the top
of their class.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.980
The people at the
top are always special,

12:32.980 --> 12:35.450
even those who are in the
countryside, you know.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.150
There are lots of
people in this country.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.050
Who knows how many geniuses are

12:41.060 --> 12:42.060
among the top
students out there?

12:45.860 --> 12:48.860
When you
were 10 years old,

12:48.220 --> 12:53.230
My Dreams: 1. Scholar
2. International person

12:48.860 --> 12:50.800
you had two dreams.

12:52.070 --> 12:56.000
One of them was that you
wanted to be a scholar

12:56.000 --> 12:59.010
and share your thoughts
with the world.

13:00.740 --> 13:04.880
Another one was that you
wanted to work internationally

13:04.880 --> 13:06.080
so that you would be able

13:06.080 --> 13:09.450
to expand your
horizons as a person.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.790
Works of Ogai Mori

13:21.920 --> 13:24.170
Strait Is the Gate
by Andre Gide

13:23.470 --> 13:27.430
Satoru's been elected president
of the student council?

13:27.440 --> 13:31.040
Yes, also the captain
of the tennis team

13:31.040 --> 13:33.940
and the chief editor of
the school newspaper.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.540
Plus, he's always
our top student,

13:35.540 --> 13:38.310
leading the second by
more than 50 points.

13:39.850 --> 13:43.220
Not to mention he was top in
the recent nation mock exam.

13:43.220 --> 13:47.950
I hope he
is not hurting himself

13:47.960 --> 13:50.360
by working so very
hard like this.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.030
And there's more, Mrs. Ichijo.

13:53.090 --> 13:55.730
Top students tend to
get picked on by others,

13:55.730 --> 13:59.330
but for some reason, just
one word from Satoru,

13:59.330 --> 14:02.770
and everyone listens
to what he's saying.

14:02.770 --> 14:04.200
They'd follow him anywhere.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.470
Such a smart student,

14:07.480 --> 14:08.780
and popular as well.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.210
Just being his
teacher makes me so proud.

14:17.230 --> 14:20.110
Tokushima Prefectural Tournament

14:28.360 --> 14:29.930
Match!

14:36.770 --> 14:39.070
You entered
Jonan High School,

14:39.070 --> 14:41.370
the top school in
the prefecture,

14:42.410 --> 14:45.910
while undergoing intense
training in kendo.

14:45.910 --> 14:49.480
You also studied furiously
during the two-hour round trip

14:49.480 --> 14:50.780
on the train, every day.

14:53.050 --> 14:54.320
I just went out today.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.520
I was a bit concerned
after yesterday.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.130
Oh, you can say that again.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.970
Hello, sir.

15:07.970 --> 15:08.870
Sit here.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.000
Oh.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.140
Thank you very much.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.710
But, uh, I'm okay.

Tomei University Law School

15:34.160 --> 15:35.630

15:38.100 --> 15:41.400
Satoru Ichijo

15:39.230 --> 15:41.070
You're number's there!

15:41.070 --> 15:41.900
- Yeah!
- It's there!

15:41.900 --> 15:43.100
You're number's there!

15:43.100 --> 15:44.270
Let's go! Let's go!

15:45.740 --> 15:48.440
- Congratulations!
- Let's go!

15:48.440 --> 15:49.940
Let's go!

15:49.950 --> 15:51.410
Ready!

15:51.410 --> 15:52.380
Go, go, go!

15:55.330 --> 16:00.710
Congrats on getting into Tomei Univ!
The future depends on you!

15:55.880 --> 15:59.090
You got into the
prestigious Tomei University.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.600
I hardly did anything.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.200
You did it all by yourself.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.970
And then you left for Tokyo.

16:27.120 --> 16:27.950
Hey!

16:27.950 --> 16:28.850
- You!
- Hey.

16:32.890 --> 16:34.390
Hey.

16:34.390 --> 16:35.990
That's a tough book
you're reading.

16:34.450 --> 16:36.490
Being and Time by Heidegger

16:35.990 --> 16:39.160
It's not even one of the
books that's on the exam, is it?

16:39.160 --> 16:41.160
Yeah, I'm just
reading it for myself.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.760
Oh.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.800
Are you from the countryside?

16:44.800 --> 16:48.400
Listen, in
college, it's all about

16:48.400 --> 16:52.170
how well you use the notes
the past students left behind.

16:52.170 --> 16:53.240
Really?

16:53.240 --> 16:54.510
- Uh-huh.
- To land a good job,

16:54.510 --> 16:55.740
when you're outta here,
you got to be efficient.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.010
The more A's you get,
your chances are better

16:58.010 --> 16:59.410
of getting into a ministry.

17:01.350 --> 17:02.450
Hey, look!

17:02.450 --> 17:04.079
That's Chiaki Minase.

17:04.089 --> 17:07.450
Her dad's a Tomei alum and
a judge, and he's famous.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.990
Morning.

17:08.990 --> 17:10.220
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.819
Man, she's hot.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.440
Chiaki Minase.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.480
I'll never
forget you, Satoru.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.010
Every one of us would
eventually become aware

17:34.020 --> 17:36.620
of your extraordinary
insight and genius.

17:40.350 --> 17:46.310
Become the wisest man in Japan!

17:46.290 --> 17:48.260
All right, here we go.

17:48.260 --> 17:49.530
I want to learn,

17:49.530 --> 17:52.530
and I want to use what
I learn for something.

17:52.530 --> 17:56.100
Those two passions carried
me all throughout my youth.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.740
Then one day...

18:03.850 --> 18:04.740
Yes?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.050
Mr. Ichijo, a telegram.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.220
Oh, thank you.

18:26.350 --> 18:30.020
Father in critical condition.
Come home ASAP.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.740
No.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.440
So how is he?

18:38.480 --> 18:40.950
Oh, he's fine, no worries.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.250
He'll be released

18:42.250 --> 18:44.050
from here soon.

18:44.050 --> 18:45.450
He's good. I see.

18:46.330 --> 18:48.330
Nobutada Ichijo

18:49.990 --> 18:50.890
How is he?

18:51.930 --> 18:54.890
He's got an acute
stomach ulcer.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.900
Luckily, we got here quickly,

18:56.900 --> 18:58.870
so they could save his life.

18:58.870 --> 19:01.400
But they told me that
he'll have to stay here

19:01.400 --> 19:02.870
for at least a whole month.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.100
Oh, really?

19:04.110 --> 19:05.710
Uh-huh.

19:05.710 --> 19:08.610
I'm glad he's alive.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.550
Father?

19:16.680 --> 19:19.790
Hey there, Satoru.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.390
Oh, Satoru.

19:26.490 --> 19:29.000
Mom must be relieved and
happy if you're around.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.400
Seriously, you need
to look after Mom more,

19:34.400 --> 19:35.700
while I'm away.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.040
Your school's nearby.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.140
Oh, oh, yeah, sorry.

19:40.910 --> 19:41.810
Satoru.

19:45.250 --> 19:49.220
God forbid, if anything
happens to your father,

19:49.220 --> 19:51.380
I want you to know this.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.390
Don't worry about us.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.560
We'll be just fine, okay?

19:55.560 --> 19:58.220
If you want to study,
you can work part-time

19:58.230 --> 20:01.530
and still be able to
go to graduate school.

20:01.530 --> 20:03.160
Mother.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.060
Mm-hmm.

20:07.870 --> 20:10.300
What an ungrateful son
I've been until now.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.440
If Father can't work anymore,

20:15.440 --> 20:18.310
maybe I should give up
on becoming a scholar

20:18.310 --> 20:20.180
and get a job to
help out back home.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.090
Mr. Ichijo, how are
you feeling, today?

20:34.260 --> 20:35.560
- Hello, doctor.
- Huh?

20:37.400 --> 20:40.570
I really have cancer, don't I?

20:40.570 --> 20:43.400
Until we do more tests and
an endoscopy, I can't tell.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.200
Please tell me
the truth, doctor.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.940
Well, just let me
do my job, all right?

20:49.440 --> 20:51.510
You worry way too
much, you know.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.650
Look at this fine
son you've got here.

20:53.650 --> 20:55.850
You need to try harder
to get well for him.

20:55.850 --> 20:56.950
What are you reading?

20:57.820 --> 20:58.650
Max Weber.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.950
Oh, that's fantastic.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.490
That's a great
book to start with.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.590
- Your, uh-
- Yes.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.060
Future is bright.

21:06.190 --> 21:07.090
Thank you.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.470
He was way smarter than
any of us were back then,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.840
so I thought he'd become
a scholar or a politician.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.210
Yeah, but he's
the type who goes

21:25.210 --> 21:26.410
for what he thinks is right.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.910
Mm-hmm.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.020
In a way, he might be the
most successful of us all.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.480
Honestly, though,

21:31.490 --> 21:34.190
what he's doing now
is totally beyond me.

21:35.890 --> 21:39.590
He was always doing things
way beyond our understanding.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.660
You remember, that
paper he wrote

21:42.660 --> 21:43.900
for Professor Ohara's class?

21:43.900 --> 21:45.100
- It was so complex.
- Ah!

21:45.100 --> 21:46.500
- I remember that one.
- I think it was

21:46.500 --> 21:48.630
on "The Origins of
Totalitarianism," wasn't it?

21:49.870 --> 21:50.700
By Hannah Arendt, that's it.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.340
Hm, that's right.

21:52.340 --> 21:55.210
He said, "Brilliantly
unlocking the secrets of Nazism,

21:55.210 --> 21:57.410
there's no question who
the leading philosopher

21:57.410 --> 22:00.880
of the 20th century
is, Hannah Arendt."

22:02.950 --> 22:04.520
Your work is mature.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.910
On the World of Values
in Hannah Arendt

22:04.520 --> 22:06.920
If you can double the
length of this paper,

22:06.920 --> 22:09.220
in terms of an
acceptable thesis,

22:10.330 --> 22:11.590
it would be considered well

22:11.590 --> 22:13.630
above the level
needed for passing.

22:13.630 --> 22:14.860
Uh, thank you.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.530
That being said,

22:16.530 --> 22:20.030
since you're capable of
such philosophical thought,

22:20.030 --> 22:23.740
I wonder if you're suited for
a pragmatic subject like law.

22:26.170 --> 22:29.940
Tell me, are you devoting
time to studying law?

22:31.110 --> 22:32.010
Uh-huh.

22:36.150 --> 22:37.780
Oh.

22:45.060 --> 22:47.730
It was like I was living
in a moment forever.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.200
My dearest

22:50.830 --> 22:52.600
I'm sorry. After you.

22:52.240 --> 22:56.910
Why don't we listen

22:54.470 --> 22:57.540
Oh, no, after you, I insist.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.330
For the voices of the wind?

22:57.540 --> 22:58.600
Here you go.

22:58.610 --> 22:59.570
I can't.

22:59.570 --> 23:00.840
It's okay.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.920
On a cold hill

23:02.440 --> 23:03.710
Thank you.

23:04.130 --> 23:06.920
In Umegaoka

23:07.380 --> 23:15.180
It blows from nowhere

23:16.100 --> 23:21.060
Telling me restlessly

23:21.560 --> 23:26.650
That our love may go astray

23:23.630 --> 23:26.770
Dear
Miss Chiaki Minase,

23:26.740 --> 23:27.570
My dearest...

23:27.650 --> 23:35.410
Why don't we
Listen for the voices of the wind

23:42.080 --> 23:47.300
See how vivid

23:47.920 --> 23:53.300
The lingering snow looks

23:53.890 --> 23:58.310
What blows over it

23:59.640 --> 24:04.820
Is an everlasting

24:05.400 --> 24:06.780
Gentle wind

24:06.860 --> 24:10.070
To Ms. Chiaki Minase

24:11.320 --> 24:19.330
Oh, there is something there

24:18.850 --> 24:21.050
"My dearest, why
don't we listen

24:20.160 --> 24:25.500
That looks trembling

24:21.060 --> 24:22.590
for the voices of the wind?

24:24.930 --> 24:29.030
On a cold hill on Umegaoka,
it blows from nowhere,

24:29.340 --> 24:34.090
Oh, my dearest

24:30.400 --> 24:34.130
telling me restlessly that
our love may go astray.

24:35.220 --> 24:38.430
It's too immature

24:36.000 --> 24:39.170
Why don't you listen for
the voices of the wind?"

24:38.560 --> 24:42.940
To call it love

24:43.810 --> 24:51.820
Yet it's too awkward to
Call it friendship

24:52.400 --> 24:57.580
Our hearts are

24:58.200 --> 25:06.210
At the mercy of the wind

25:09.800 --> 25:17.800
Out of nowhere it brings
An eternal feeling

25:19.010 --> 25:21.430
On the World of Values
in Hannah Arendt

25:21.520 --> 25:26.560
That resembles noble sadness

25:27.390 --> 25:31.760
"For Arendt, living humanely
and freely are the same thing.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.530
To live freely is to join
political activities.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.140
In other words, having political
freedom makes you human.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.970
If you don't have it,
you're living like an animal

25:47.980 --> 25:49.640
or a slave, at your core.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.050
After the rise of Marxism,

25:54.050 --> 25:56.250
the society gave
undeserved praise

25:56.250 --> 25:58.420
to labor as a political value.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.720
It's a shame that people are
now working like slaves."

26:06.960 --> 26:07.930
This is difficult.

26:12.370 --> 26:15.370
I understand exactly what
you're saying, Professor,

26:15.370 --> 26:18.240
but I don't agree with
your view on the Cold War.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.510
Honestly, I think your view

26:19.510 --> 26:21.210
- is completely wrong.
- Hey.

26:21.210 --> 26:22.110
Wow.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.150
Maybe you are right, Satoru.

26:28.150 --> 26:30.120
But it's not wise to
challenge the professor

26:30.120 --> 26:32.020
in front of the class like that.

26:32.020 --> 26:35.650
But there is no doubt that
communism will collapse soon.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.190
I just said what I
knew to be correct.

26:38.190 --> 26:41.030
Hey, criticizing the
professor's gonna hurt

26:41.030 --> 26:42.190
your grades, you know.

26:44.270 --> 26:48.000
They say that silence
goes further than eloquence.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.300
What?

26:49.300 --> 26:51.140
Too much talking
will cost you.

26:52.770 --> 26:56.180
I'm talking about you.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.720
I remember
the joy of walking

27:06.720 --> 27:07.990
in the summer evening.

27:09.860 --> 27:13.490
I loved being engrossed in
a book on a warm autumn day.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.630
I experienced such
happiness repeatedly.

27:22.510 --> 27:27.680
An Inquiry into the Good
by Kitaro Nishida

27:27.480 --> 27:30.610
You've been sending your
poems to Chiaki Minase?

27:30.610 --> 27:31.840
Are you serious?

27:31.850 --> 27:33.580
Mm-hmm, and I
sent her my paper

27:33.580 --> 27:35.610
on Hannah Arendt,
the other day, too.

27:35.620 --> 27:37.380
- Whoa.
- Seriously?

27:37.390 --> 27:39.790
You sent that out
of the blue to her?

27:39.790 --> 27:41.290
That's brave.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.190
When I read your paper, it
gave me such a headache.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.290
Yeah, I guess it's a little
difficult for you guys.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.990
Uh...

27:49.930 --> 27:51.200
Listen, Satoru.

27:52.530 --> 27:54.330
I think you're
making it difficult

27:54.340 --> 27:56.870
for Chiaki to respond to you.

27:56.870 --> 27:58.700
Well, that's not what I want,

27:58.710 --> 28:01.910
'cause to me, she's like a
personification of eternity.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.280
Uh-huh.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.110
I want her to never forget
that I existed in this world.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.550
That's all that I ask.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.790
Anyway, we'll
put in a good word

28:13.790 --> 28:16.960
to Chiaki for you,
as well.

28:27.580 --> 28:31.710
My dearest Chiaki

28:32.830 --> 28:37.960
Let's take a walk together quietly

28:38.630 --> 28:46.510
Let me hold the sleeve of your Yukata

28:47.180 --> 28:55.190
And tell you a fairy tale

29:00.360 --> 29:06.070
But you're looking away

29:06.490 --> 29:14.500
Watching only fireflies

29:20.460 --> 29:25.140
My dearest Chiaki

29:25.680 --> 29:30.930
At dusk of the early summer

29:31.480 --> 29:36.440
Putting my arm around your shoulder

29:37.110 --> 29:42.070
I never feel lonely

29:42.650 --> 29:47.910
Nothing makes me lonely

29:48.580 --> 29:50.830
I never

29:49.080 --> 29:52.480
Dear Satoru,
I am very sorry,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.580
Feel sad

29:54.020 --> 29:58.520
but I'm not the ideal woman
that you imagine I am.

29:54.160 --> 29:59.420
Nothing makes me sad

30:15.240 --> 30:19.780
Satoru, know that I think of it.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.310
Those letters were
letters for the future.

30:25.420 --> 30:29.790
Your 13 letters were filled
with clear yet eternal words.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.090
They were telling me to
remember you in your youth.

30:37.460 --> 30:41.170
Perhaps I was being tasked to
serve as your time capsule.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.000
Here you go!

30:46.010 --> 30:47.840
- Ah, just in time.
- Thank you.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.110
- Yours.
- Thanks.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.550
It was difficult to
see him heartbroken.

30:54.680 --> 30:57.550
And,
Kurosawa, what you said

30:57.550 --> 31:00.420
to him was unnecessary.

31:00.420 --> 31:03.690
Oh, yeah,
I felt bad about that.

31:03.690 --> 31:05.290
I just stoked his
competitive fire

31:05.290 --> 31:08.060
by telling him you're
not really a law student

31:08.060 --> 31:10.160
if you don't even try
to take the bar exam.

31:11.230 --> 31:12.260
Imagine my surprise

31:13.800 --> 31:16.400
when he suddenly started
studying for the exam really hard

31:16.400 --> 31:18.200
because of what I said.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.540
Yeah, I remember
that, even then,

31:20.540 --> 31:23.540
he was trying to find the
right path for himself.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.780
And it really seemed

31:24.780 --> 31:27.280
like college classes
were not a challenge.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.920
According to Karl
Popper, and I quote:

31:29.920 --> 31:32.450
Closed societies believe
in the unprovable,

31:32.450 --> 31:34.190
like gods and the afterlife.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.990
The society that's
free from superstition

31:36.990 --> 31:40.160
and believes in science
is an open society.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.230
A theory from the
empirical sciences-

31:46.230 --> 31:48.530
- What's the matter?

31:48.540 --> 31:49.400
Oh, nothing.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.110
Do you think that it's
acceptable to be teaching

31:54.110 --> 31:57.880
about atheist theory and
philosophy at a university level?

31:59.410 --> 32:01.210
Well, I'm a Christian myself.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.750
But to be honest,

32:03.750 --> 32:05.550
I don't get this
whole afterlife.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.450
I see.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.930
There might not be any
professor I can learn from here.

32:28.110 --> 32:33.120
Mock Bar Exam
Top student in April: Satoru Ichijo

32:34.200 --> 32:37.240
Mock Bar Exam
Top student in May: Satoru Ichijo

32:38.330 --> 32:41.870
Mock Bar Exam
Top student in June: Satoru Ichijo

32:40.020 --> 32:41.620
You failed?

32:41.620 --> 32:44.890
You got top score on the
exam six times in a row.

32:44.890 --> 32:46.120
Yeah.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.930
I passed the short
answer part easily,

32:47.930 --> 32:52.000
but then I criticized the
existing law in my essay.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.770
- You did that again?
- Huh?

32:53.770 --> 32:55.670
What did we tell you
about doing that on exams?

32:55.670 --> 32:57.200
You know you're gonna fail

32:57.200 --> 33:00.210
when you criticize existing
law on the exam like that.

33:00.210 --> 33:02.940
Though I didn't pass
the essay part, either.

33:04.410 --> 33:06.910
It's just that I
can't help myself

33:06.910 --> 33:10.220
but to point out what
is ideologically wrong.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.520
So what are you
going to do now?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.390
You want to be a professor.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.260
You should continue
here at the lab.

33:20.260 --> 33:23.660
But you've read
like 1,400 books.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.660
Are you okay not staying here?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.670
Political science and
jurisprudence can't teach us

33:29.670 --> 33:31.240
what's right and what's wrong.

33:32.340 --> 33:37.110
I'd rather unify all the
different philosophies

33:37.110 --> 33:40.410
and create a new ideology
that will last forever.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.180
Not sure what you mean,

33:46.490 --> 33:48.190
but it doesn't sound you're
lookin' to land a job,

33:48.190 --> 33:50.190
at least not right away.

33:50.190 --> 33:52.060
But you are going to work
somewhere, aren't you?

33:52.060 --> 33:53.530
Mm-hmm.

33:53.530 --> 33:56.930
For starters, I'm gonna look
for a job near my house.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.460
- What?
- Huh?

33:59.470 --> 34:00.900
Remember how worried we were

34:00.900 --> 34:02.300
when he said he was
joining a trading company?

34:02.300 --> 34:03.570
- That's right.
- Oh, yeah!

34:03.570 --> 34:05.370
And he doesn't even
drink or play mahjong.

34:05.370 --> 34:06.810
With the professor's referral,

34:06.810 --> 34:09.340
he could've been at the
Maicho paper or Bank of Japan.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.280
- Ah!
- Such a waste!

34:10.280 --> 34:11.780
Didn't he say,

34:11.780 --> 34:13.949
"I want to test myself by
starting out from zero?"

34:13.949 --> 34:15.310
Yeah.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.880
Well, I guess he did really.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.719
In the end, it looks
like everything happened

34:18.719 --> 34:20.350
just the way it was supposed to.

34:20.350 --> 34:21.820
With a law degree.

34:21.820 --> 34:24.820
Mr. Ichijo started working
for the Toho Trading Company,

34:24.830 --> 34:27.989
only to leave at age 30
to establish Taiyoukai.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.100
I'm less than optimistic
about our future.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.000
Yes.

34:34.370 --> 34:37.300
If only he was still here
to get us through this.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.370
Hmm? Him, huh?

34:40.840 --> 34:41.909
What's done is done.

34:41.909 --> 34:43.010
Nothing we can do.

34:44.139 --> 34:46.750
I should've paid
better attention.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.080
Me as well.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.320
I'm just as guilty.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.880
I'm the one who insisted that
we absolutely had to hire him.

34:53.889 --> 34:55.449
I feel exactly the same.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.960
At his job interview,

34:59.960 --> 35:03.500
I tested his patience by
speaking way too harshly to him.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.230
But he didn't even flinch.

35:07.570 --> 35:08.970
Look at you.

35:08.970 --> 35:10.840
You're the public servant type.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.270
You're not suited to
work for a trading house.

35:14.610 --> 35:17.080
You rarely come
across a young man

35:17.080 --> 35:18.710
as tough as he was.

35:18.710 --> 35:21.050
I take it that's
why you called upon me

35:21.050 --> 35:22.550
to recruit him personally, huh?

35:23.980 --> 35:26.020
At that time, he was...

35:31.230 --> 35:32.260
Mr. Goto.

35:37.800 --> 35:41.030
Why the pinstripes?

35:44.740 --> 35:46.300
I really like it.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.810
Oh, so you are Satoru Ichijo?

35:50.210 --> 35:52.810
We are actually looking for
unique individuals like you.

35:54.050 --> 35:56.350
It might sound unusual
for a Tomei graduate

35:56.350 --> 35:58.650
with a law degree
to be a trader,

35:58.650 --> 36:01.720
but you see, I graduated
from Tomei like you.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.890
Then tell me, why did
you decide to work here?

36:07.900 --> 36:09.830
Weren't you offered other
professional choices,

36:09.830 --> 36:11.100
like banking maybe?

36:11.100 --> 36:12.800
Mr. Ichijo, that's no way

36:12.800 --> 36:14.070
- to speak to a-
- Ah, it's all right.

36:14.070 --> 36:14.970
Ah.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.670
Why did I choose to work here?

36:19.610 --> 36:21.940
Banking is mentally stimulating.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.540
That's for sure.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.010
But trading's more than that.

36:25.010 --> 36:28.710
It's also stimulating,
but you can dream big.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.480
Dream big?

36:32.750 --> 36:35.090
Obviously, you're intelligent.

36:35.090 --> 36:37.560
But at the same time,

36:37.560 --> 36:38.620
you're a dreamer.

36:39.930 --> 36:43.600
Someone like you should
come work in trading.

36:45.730 --> 36:48.830
Intelligent and a dreamer.

36:51.000 --> 36:51.900
Hmm?

36:53.670 --> 36:57.040
Ichijo, we'd be honored

36:57.040 --> 36:59.180
to have your talents
at our company.

37:01.380 --> 37:05.880
Mr. Goto, please, you
don't have to do that.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.630
Happiness Essays by Carl Hilty

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I want to be a
thinker, after all.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.570
With graduation drawing near,

37:54.570 --> 37:56.600
I could feel my passion growing.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.880
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

38:05.810 --> 38:09.710
Ooh!

38:13.890 --> 38:14.790
All right.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.120
Got a good haul today,
didn't we?

38:22.630 --> 38:24.730
Satoru, what's wrong?

38:33.710 --> 38:38.780
The life of a
fish is fragile or transient.

38:52.930 --> 38:56.800
I should look back on my
life and reflect on that.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.170
When I read your paper,

39:01.170 --> 39:02.600
it gave me such a
headache.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.940
Yeah, I guess it's a little
difficult for you guys.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.740
Mom must be relieved and
happy if you're around.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.920
Seriously, you need
to look after Mom more,

39:16.920 --> 39:18.280
while I'm away.

39:18.290 --> 39:19.550
Your school's nearby.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.950
Oh, oh, yeah, sorry.

39:25.790 --> 39:27.030
Why did I say things

39:27.030 --> 39:29.030
that hurt other
people's feelings?

39:30.730 --> 39:34.270
When did I throw away
their acts of kindness?

39:35.970 --> 39:38.200
Where does this
selfishness come from?

39:41.270 --> 39:44.410
God forbid, if anything
happens to your father,

39:44.410 --> 39:46.240
I want you to know this.

39:47.350 --> 39:49.410
Don't worry about us.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.180
We'll be just fine, okay?

39:52.290 --> 39:55.020
If you wanna study,
you can work part-time

39:55.020 --> 39:58.360
and still be able to
go to graduate school.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.690
Satoru is a really good guy.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.130
He's just super honest

40:02.130 --> 40:03.560
- and straightforward.
- Uh-huh.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.060
So pretty please.

40:05.070 --> 40:08.200
Could you please answer
his letters, just once?

40:08.200 --> 40:11.970
Father, Mother, my friends,

40:13.910 --> 40:16.340
I've been given so
much in my life,

40:20.880 --> 40:24.380
but all I was focused
on was my own success.

40:26.490 --> 40:28.850
When did I ever
cast aside my needs,

40:28.860 --> 40:32.320
and just how much have I ever
devoted myself to others?

40:37.200 --> 40:40.030
Once more, want to restart,

40:41.740 --> 40:43.470
want to be reborn.

40:53.250 --> 40:57.280
I can say that that was when
I experienced my first death.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.890
It meant that I had
to bury my false self.

41:08.590 --> 41:12.970
March 23, 1981

41:27.710 --> 41:30.680
Is someone trying to
tell me something?

41:39.660 --> 41:40.560
What?

41:44.880 --> 41:49.880
Good news.

41:59.710 --> 42:00.780
Good news?

42:00.780 --> 42:01.850
Is it like the Gospel
in Christianity?

42:09.090 --> 42:10.490
Who are you?

42:10.490 --> 42:11.460
Tell me your name.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.450
Nikko.

42:22.140 --> 42:23.030
Nikko?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.070
The first spirit to contact me

42:28.070 --> 42:32.780
by automatic writing was the
monk Nichiren's disciple Nikko.

42:35.580 --> 42:39.580
On that day, my life was
completely turned around.

42:44.290 --> 42:47.360
One week later, Nichiren
started contacting me.

42:51.060 --> 42:52.330
Please tell me.

42:52.330 --> 42:54.230
What am I supposed
to do with my life?

43:08.880 --> 43:14.260
Love people, nurture people,
and forgive people.

43:14.190 --> 43:19.260
Love people, nurture
people, and forgive people.

43:21.960 --> 43:24.530
So this means this is my mission

43:24.530 --> 43:27.100
and what I have to
accomplish in this lifetime.

43:28.570 --> 43:30.070
From now on,

43:30.070 --> 43:34.470
you're going to prove the
existence of the afterworld.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.230
Nichiren

43:34.470 --> 43:39.410
Your work will bring happiness
to all people in this world.

43:45.890 --> 43:48.450
I do understand what
you're telling me.

43:48.460 --> 43:53.520
But I, I'm not sure if I'm
ready to do such a mission now.

43:54.660 --> 43:57.200
I think, at first, I
need more experience

43:57.200 --> 43:59.230
and to establish my
professional career.

44:00.170 --> 44:02.100
I understand.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.900
My task is to
herald the beginning

44:04.900 --> 44:07.110
of your spiritual communication.

44:08.810 --> 44:12.880
You'll be visited by
various other spirits soon.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.540
Socrates

44:24.190 --> 44:26.220
This is how
I learned of my mission

44:26.230 --> 44:28.790
to spread the truth about
the spiritual world.

44:48.050 --> 44:50.550
Does this mean that more
than half of them are

44:50.550 --> 44:53.020
under the influence
of evil spirits?

45:06.370 --> 45:08.950
You are right.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.600
How can they protect themselves?

45:32.430 --> 45:34.960
The law of the same wavelength?

45:34.960 --> 45:37.700
So their state of mind
attracts evil spirits.

45:45.940 --> 45:48.170
Here you go.

45:49.510 --> 45:51.580
Mr. Iida, is it
true what they say,

45:51.580 --> 45:53.240
that you worked with Mr. Ichijo?

45:54.080 --> 45:56.280
- Yeah.
- Wow.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.450
Were you friends, too?

45:57.450 --> 46:00.520
No, I was always
giving him a hard time.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.790
But I couldn't hate him.

46:03.760 --> 46:06.290
No matter how harshly
I treated Satoru,

46:04.470 --> 46:09.310
Tokyo, 1981

46:06.290 --> 46:07.930
it never bothered him.

46:07.930 --> 46:09.790
He was as strong as steel.

46:09.800 --> 46:10.700
Take care of this.

46:10.700 --> 46:11.600
Right away.

46:14.810 --> 46:17.770
Exports and Foreign Exchange Div.

46:18.170 --> 46:21.870
Hey, you'll only make enemies
reading books like this.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.040
Don't be cocky 'cause
you're a Tomei grad.

46:25.250 --> 46:26.140
Sorry, sir.

46:26.370 --> 46:28.950
The Miracle of Mind Dynamics

46:31.820 --> 46:33.720
Satoru, come here!

46:33.720 --> 46:34.620
Yes, sir.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.090
What are you doing?

46:41.090 --> 46:43.530
You wrote $27 million
instead of 27 million yen.

46:43.530 --> 46:44.930
Are you out of your mind?

46:44.930 --> 46:47.830
- Oh, so sorry.
- You're in currency exchange!

46:47.830 --> 46:49.400
You're a Tomei graduate!

46:49.400 --> 46:52.700
Don't you know the difference
between yen and dollars?

46:52.710 --> 46:54.070
I'm very sorry, sir.

46:54.070 --> 46:55.310
I'll fix it right away.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.790
Could you be slower?

47:13.790 --> 47:15.190
Learn to use an abacus!

47:16.130 --> 47:17.600
I'm sorry.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.560
I never learned to use
an abacus in college.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.300
No more excuses!

47:36.320 --> 47:37.980
Oh, Mr. Iida.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.550
He indeed gets
crazy angry like that,

47:40.550 --> 47:42.620
but he said no excuses.

47:42.620 --> 47:44.290
Remember, he's right about that.

47:50.230 --> 47:51.400
Thank you very much.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
Oh, so even he had
a freshman moment.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.970
Yeah, for the first year
at least, but he learned,

48:00.970 --> 48:02.970
so quickly he
surprised everybody.

48:14.810 --> 48:17.020
If you're a man

48:17.140 --> 48:21.650
Even if you make an enemy

48:21.770 --> 48:26.280
Of the whole world

48:26.400 --> 48:30.990
There're times

48:29.300 --> 48:31.140
Hello, it's Satoru.

48:31.110 --> 48:35.990
When you must fight

48:31.140 --> 48:33.270
Your message, I received it.

48:33.270 --> 48:34.470
Yes.

48:34.470 --> 48:35.970
Thank you.

48:35.980 --> 48:39.810
Satoru, did you
finish that document for me?

48:39.810 --> 48:40.710
Yes.

48:45.130 --> 48:46.710
There's

48:45.950 --> 48:47.020
Here you go.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.510

48:49.630 --> 48:57.640
You can count on

48:58.360 --> 48:59.900
Make it simpler.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.560
Because

49:00.850 --> 49:03.310
This world might

49:01.730 --> 49:03.070
Right away.

49:03.440 --> 49:07.690
Turn against you

49:08.070 --> 49:12.530
And deny

49:12.660 --> 49:16.290
Everything

49:15.010 --> 49:16.780
Hello, foreign
exchange division.

49:16.410 --> 49:21.710
About you

49:19.650 --> 49:20.990
Yes, thank you very much.

49:24.500 --> 49:28.960
At that moment

49:29.090 --> 49:30.550
How do you fight your way?

50:22.940 --> 50:26.520
There must be someone

50:24.780 --> 50:26.120
You did this?

50:27.250 --> 50:28.690
What is it?

50:27.360 --> 50:28.690
Who believes,

50:28.690 --> 50:30.860
I made an operation
manual on foreign exchange.

50:29.650 --> 50:37.660
Supports, and loves you forever

50:30.860 --> 50:32.460
It covers everything.

50:32.460 --> 50:34.730
This should make
it clear to anyone

50:34.730 --> 50:37.160
who needs to know how
our business works.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.070
Hey, take a look at this.

50:39.160 --> 50:45.420
Somewhere in the universe

50:43.370 --> 50:44.940
You've mastered it already?

50:44.940 --> 50:46.170
Yes.

50:46.170 --> 50:47.740
It was for my own sake as well.

50:48.250 --> 50:54.630
But if you're a man...

50:53.480 --> 50:54.810
That surprised me.

50:54.810 --> 50:57.010
It was simple and
easy to understand.

50:57.020 --> 50:58.980
He had written a manual
explaining everyone's job

50:58.990 --> 51:00.350
in the department.

51:00.350 --> 51:03.090
So he was highly
competent after all.

51:03.090 --> 51:07.060
What about that
special ability he has?

51:07.060 --> 51:10.830
Well, there were rumors
he was conducting exorcisms

51:10.830 --> 51:13.830
on days off, but it didn't
interfere with his work here.

51:15.270 --> 51:17.070
I never thought
that he'd beat me

51:17.070 --> 51:19.800
in the trading
business examination,

51:19.810 --> 51:21.940
and I'd lose my chance
to go to New York.

51:23.840 --> 51:24.740
Yes.

51:26.180 --> 51:28.080
The office was a tough
environment for me,

51:28.080 --> 51:30.010
because I had psychic abilities.

51:46.170 --> 51:47.230
How
many times do you have

51:47.230 --> 51:48.430
to make the same mistakes?

51:48.430 --> 51:49.900
- I'm really sorry, sir.
- Hey, you moron!

51:49.900 --> 51:51.140
Don't sorry me.

51:51.140 --> 51:52.100
- You stupid now?
- I asked you

51:52.110 --> 51:53.270
when are you gonna get it done?

51:53.270 --> 51:54.310
- Tell him to get goin!
- No apologies!

51:54.310 --> 51:55.440
- Right now!
- Right now!

51:55.440 --> 51:56.940
- Hey, did you hear me?
- Now I said!

51:56.940 --> 51:58.640
You idiot!

52:09.120 --> 52:10.450
That's awful.

52:33.910 --> 52:36.280
Oh divine spirits in heaven,

52:36.280 --> 52:37.950
give me the light.

53:13.150 --> 53:14.650
Nichiren

53:14.950 --> 53:17.420
You are clearly

Ryoma Sakamoto

53:17.420 --> 53:19.690
And what each of you
tells me is consistent.

53:21.490 --> 53:24.760
So there's no question that
the spirit world really exists.

53:26.530 --> 53:28.830
But who would
believe me if I tried

53:28.830 --> 53:30.670
to tell the world about this?

53:35.750 --> 53:41.680
Nichiren

53:35.940 --> 53:38.580
There's no
better time than right now

53:38.580 --> 53:41.410
for you to teach the
whole world the truth.

53:49.060 --> 53:52.720
So you said there were
different spirits coming

53:52.730 --> 53:53.790
to visit you.

53:53.790 --> 53:55.830
Is it still going on?

53:55.830 --> 53:56.860
Yes, it is.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.600
But in this world, I'm
a very busy businessman.

54:01.730 --> 54:04.700
But they keep talking to
me, regardless of that.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.900
Amazing.

54:07.810 --> 54:10.210
It must be tough for
you, working there,

54:10.210 --> 54:14.250
when you're so spiritually
sensitive, you know.

54:15.480 --> 54:17.210
You really are a trooper.

54:17.220 --> 54:19.550
Hmm, thanks, Father.

54:22.090 --> 54:23.520
Oh.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.990
We have been having
conversations

54:25.990 --> 54:27.590
through automatic writing.

54:27.590 --> 54:30.130
But I wonder if these
spirits could use my lips

54:30.130 --> 54:32.230
to speak and tell
what they think.

54:32.230 --> 54:34.130
Wow, really?

54:34.130 --> 54:38.840
So are there any spirits
visiting with you today?

54:38.840 --> 54:40.440
Mm-hmm.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.270
But it might be
hard believing me.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.640
You see, it's Jesus
Christ who's here today.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.520
Before I gain the
spiritual power,

54:57.520 --> 55:01.090
I didn't go under a waterfall
or ever go in a cave.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.060
I only did one thing.

55:05.830 --> 55:07.330
I looked within and tried

55:07.330 --> 55:09.300
to correct the
mistakes in my mind.

55:24.580 --> 55:26.520
Satoru, can I sit here?

55:27.590 --> 55:28.490
Of course.

55:38.400 --> 55:41.200
Recently, my shoulders
feel really heavy.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.200
Am I possessed or something?

55:46.240 --> 55:47.440
What?

55:47.440 --> 55:49.470
I'm more spiritual
than the others.

55:51.410 --> 55:53.310
Suffer! Suffer!

55:56.650 --> 55:57.980
You're right.

55:57.980 --> 55:59.220
You may be possessed.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.190
I knew it.

56:02.190 --> 56:04.090
Can you see it now?

56:06.090 --> 56:07.390
Suffer!

56:07.390 --> 56:08.690
Do you think that
it can be removed?

56:08.690 --> 56:10.230
Hmm?

56:10.230 --> 56:11.860
I can try to exorcize it.

56:12.900 --> 56:14.570
I think that'll make it go away.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.700
But to keep the evil
spirit from returning,

56:18.700 --> 56:21.710
you must tune in to
God with your mind

56:21.710 --> 56:23.440
and start living positively.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.380
It's the only way
it won't come back.

56:26.410 --> 56:27.280
I got it.

56:28.750 --> 56:29.810
I promise.

56:29.820 --> 56:31.120
I won't tell anyone.

56:31.120 --> 56:32.880
Get rid of it, please.

56:34.220 --> 56:35.490
Mm.

56:43.030 --> 56:44.860
Evil spirit who
possesses this man,

56:47.230 --> 56:49.400
I command you to leave
his body right now.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.710
It feels so much lighter now.

57:05.850 --> 57:07.420
Thank you, Satoru.

57:08.250 --> 57:09.150
Satoru.

57:12.730 --> 57:16.560
In July 1981,
my subconscious opened up,

57:18.460 --> 57:22.000
and then Buddha spoke
sternly and passionately

57:22.000 --> 57:24.170
about my mission to
spread the truth.

57:25.370 --> 57:28.010
You're
the Buddha reborn.

57:28.010 --> 57:32.110
Your mission is to save all
people by spreading the truth.

57:30.860 --> 57:34.620
Buddha

57:33.110 --> 57:35.410
Unify all religions on earth,

57:35.410 --> 57:38.420
to establish a
new world religion

57:38.420 --> 57:41.490
and open a path to
a new civilization.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.890
If that's my mission,
it's incredible.

57:47.830 --> 57:49.790
But the way that I am now,

57:49.800 --> 57:52.230
I don't have the experience
and life-training

57:52.230 --> 57:54.430
to teach and guide others.

57:54.430 --> 57:57.400
Besides that, I need more time

57:57.400 --> 57:59.800
to deepen my understanding
of the spirit world.

58:02.580 --> 58:05.780
But despite my inner conflicts,

58:05.780 --> 58:08.750
my life was about to
take an unexpected turn.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.020
To New York?

58:15.020 --> 58:18.920
Yes, just for a
year as a trainee.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.260
Congratulations.

58:21.260 --> 58:23.290
On the trading business exam,

58:23.300 --> 58:26.430
you had the highest score
in the finance section.

58:27.830 --> 58:31.200
So now you'll learn about
finance, internationally.

58:37.310 --> 58:40.740
Mr. Ichijo, congratulations
on your move to New York.

58:40.750 --> 58:41.680
Thank you.

58:43.480 --> 58:46.180
- This is so great.
- Congratulations.

58:46.190 --> 58:49.990
All right, time for a toast
to Satoru's move to New York.

58:53.190 --> 58:54.090
Cheers.

58:54.090 --> 58:55.360
Cheers!

59:00.200 --> 59:02.030
Congratulations.

59:02.030 --> 59:03.200
Way to go.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.000
- Congratulations.
- Well done!

59:07.440 --> 59:08.470
Thanks.

59:08.470 --> 59:09.810
It looks great.

59:11.380 --> 59:12.810
I didn't think you'd beat me

59:12.810 --> 59:15.380
in the trading
business examination.

59:15.380 --> 59:17.780
So tell me, while
you're in New York,

59:17.780 --> 59:20.320
will you continue
doing exorcisms?

59:20.320 --> 59:21.150
Huh?

59:21.150 --> 59:23.350
Don't play stupid now.

59:23.360 --> 59:24.890
Do you really think
you're going to be able

59:24.890 --> 59:27.390
to work as a trainee there?

59:27.390 --> 59:28.690
It isn't over.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.460
I haven't given up on this yet.

59:34.770 --> 59:35.670
Now what?

59:37.740 --> 59:38.940
Uh, hey.

59:41.770 --> 59:42.740
Mr. Iida,

59:44.040 --> 59:46.880
it's just that I've
never been overseas.

59:46.880 --> 59:48.750
Really? That right?

59:48.750 --> 59:51.620
And somehow, I
was the one chosen

59:51.620 --> 59:53.580
to take the job in New York.

59:53.590 --> 59:55.950
You're right. Am I
really able to do it?

59:55.960 --> 59:58.320
Seriously, you kidding?

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.760
I have never heard of a
business trader crying

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.930
over being sent to New York.

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:03.830
- Stop it.
- Listen!

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:05.160
When you get sent to New York,

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.800
it means the company put
you on the fast track.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.230
You get promoted earlier,

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.000
one year for London,
two for New York, if...

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.740
Oh, wait.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:15.510
Don't tell me.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.610
You didn't know?

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.010
Huh?

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.780
Hey!

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.920
Aren't you friends with Timmy?

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.220
Timmy?

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.590
Satoru.

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.160
Oh, yes.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.230
I never thought
that that would ever happen.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.760
I said all those
rude things to him.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.900
New York, 1982

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.080
Understood.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.870
Hello.

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:17.770
Hi, what was the
buying rate this morning?

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:21.300
I just need to make sure to
hedge the exchange risks.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.540
Pardon?

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.470
Any
English speakers?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.840
Satoru, it's okay. I got it.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:31.620
Hey, Timmy!

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.820
You went to Tomei, and you
can't even speak English?

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.120
Test scores don't mean anything
if you can't speak English.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.830
What the hell am I
supposed to do with you?

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:42.730
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.930
Hello.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:54.240
Hello, I'm Tom, the
loan officer from New York Bank.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.640
Can I talk to Mr. Tomonaga

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.510
about the deal we
made the other day?

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:59.410
Is there anyone who
can speak to me about-

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:00.280
- I can.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.210
I'm in charge of finance here.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.510
How can I help you today?

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.690
That's how my battle
in New York started.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:09.590
Uh-huh.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:18.030
Ah ha ha Ah ha ha
This is the Big Apple

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.030
I came here

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:24.450
This is the Big Apple
Oh oh

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:31.160
I love New York
I love New York

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:39.170
Because this city changed my life

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:47.550
If you imagine
A spotlight from the universe

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:57.520
It certainly hits New York

01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:05.740
With eight million people
Having each story to tell

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:14.000
Life has ups and downs

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:20.590
People from all over America

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:27.260
Full of ambition to make it to the top

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:30.390
Gather like

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:30.900
Here you go.

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.480
Wild animals

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:32.840
Thank you.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:42.190
Keep fighting
In this concrete jungle

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:50.410
People from Asia, Africa
Europe, and Australia

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.870
Become New Yorkers

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:53.690
All right, according
to the textbook,

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:55.130
please describe the process

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.130
The desperate battle continues

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:57.690
for starting your own
business or project.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:01.230
Okay, there are five steps
to launching a new venture.

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:03.670
I have to survive

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:02.870
And what are the five steps?

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:06.940
Uh, develop concept,
uh, research market, uh,

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:08.550
In this jungle

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.710
create business
plan, obtain funding,

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.140
If I fall, no one cares

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.470
and put staff in place.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.710
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:19.900
If I give in to the pressure
That's only as far as I can go

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.490
Are you afraid of Caucasians?

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:32.430
Shall we continue?

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:35.370
All right, both exchange rates

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.660
Are you afraid of Harvard?

01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:39.240
and interest rates are
interrelated to domestic monetary

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.420
You think you can survive in this city
Being afraid of them?

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.740
and fiscal policies.

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.610
Now divergencies among
countries do indeed occur.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.840
You can't be intimidated

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.480
It has to do with the
policies and divestment

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.550
in the countries' exchange rates
and interest rate movement.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:52.970
By blonde Caucasian women

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.180
Fight it out if you're a man

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:04.690
Keep your heart unbreakable

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:11.570
Tiger, it's your mission

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:14.950
A Japanese tiger

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:21.420
Run through this city

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:21.880
Hi, this is Ichijo,
returning your call.

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:26.300
Climb up to the top
Of the Empire State Building

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.520
About your request, I've
already spoken to them,

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.980
so don't worry, everything
is under control.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:31.180
Beat King Kong

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.150
Thank you.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.970
Ah Ah

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:45.640
And about the issue
of the shrimp situation

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.840
and the problem with an
approved route to Japan, I-

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.370
- Sir?

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.880
Currently, we're building
a shrimp farm in Ecuador,

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.750
and we're trying to establish
a trilateral trade block

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.320
with the U.S. on
board as a buyer,

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.950
to sell the product to Japan.

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.490
Right. Next.

01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:05.690
Yes.

01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:10.660
Budweiser beer goes
down relatively easy

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.900
and is popular in the U.S.,

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.630
but it's not available
in Japan yet.

01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:18.970
If we streamline all
the production line

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:21.240
and establish an
import route to Japan,

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.210
we can expand the
base of our customers.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:25.940
- I'm sure of it.
- So, Timmy!

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.840
Sir?

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:29.580
Can you drink this beer?

01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:33.080
No, I don't drink.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.150
In New York,

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.920
he was studying international
finance in grad school,

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:42.790
and while working as the company's
youngest finance officer,

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.030
he oversaw trade
for a trillion yen

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:46.530
and foreign exchange
for the trade block,

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:49.230
as well as the company's
domestic interests.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.300
Amtrak train number 69!

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.700
Have a good day.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.100
Dear Satoru,
Long time no see. We're doing well.

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.810
Please take care.
Love, Mom.

01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:47.990
Mother.

01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:52.300
Thank you.

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:02.710
Do I really have a mission
to spread the truth

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:04.440
to people all over the world?

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.250
You do.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.010
Jesus Christ

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:17.189
Right now, conflicts and
wars are breaking out

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:19.090
all over the globe.

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:22.090
That's why you need to
tell the world, right away,

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:23.529
what true love is.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:39.779
- Give me the bag!
- No, no!

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:41.140
- Come on, I need the bag!
- Stop it!

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:42.380
- Give me the bag!
- Get away!

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.310
- Come on!
- Get away from me!

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.649
- Hey!
- Stop!

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:46.020
Let her go!

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.850
- Somebody, help
- I'm calling the police.

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:57.729
Are you okay?

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:59.930
Thank you.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:03.830
Satoru?

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:06.770
Chiaki?

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:12.479
Satoru, thank you
for saving my life.

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:13.810
Of course.

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.450
I'm just glad that you're okay.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.149
Um, so tell me what
brings you to New York.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.220
I'm here on a
short-term study program,

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.390
to learn about the
U.S. legal system.

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.060
Oh, interesting.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.229
And why are you here?

01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:35.300
Uh, I'm here as a trainee
at the New York facility

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.870
of our trading house.

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:39.300
You ended up working
in the trading business?

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.939
That's just so hard to believe.

01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:45.680
Surprised, are you?

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.979
A little.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.050
I'm curious.

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:52.979
Do you still write your poetry?

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:58.190
No, I haven't been able
to find the time for that.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.620
Oh, I see.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.130
Satoru, thank you
so much for tonight.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.000
No, thank you.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.870
We didn't really talk to each
other much back in college,

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:18.470
so this is kind of our
first real conversation.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:20.510
I guess so.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.950
So I'd be glad to walk you
to your home, if you'd like.

01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:27.580
Oh, no, that's all right.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.020
Someone's coming to get me.

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:32.190
Over here!

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:38.330
Let me introduce
my fiancé, Miura.

01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:42.430
Satoru, it's been a while.

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:46.370
We were in the prefectural
association at Tomei, remember?

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:49.110
Ah, Miura, that's right.

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:52.410
Chiaki and I are here together
for a short-term program.

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:55.350
We are hoping to get married
by the end of this year.

01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:59.720
Well, that's great.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.750
I'm happy for you.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:02.490
My father likes him, too.

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:05.490
You see, like my father,
Miura is also a judge.

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.960
Oh, I see.

01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:10.530
Congratulations.

01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:11.430
Thank you.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.700
I hope you find happiness.

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:15.930
I'm sure that you will.

01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:20.140
- Right, let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.040
Bye.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.490
Oh my dearest, it's
too immature to call it love,

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.900
yet it's too awkward
to call it friendship.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.500
Our hearts are at the
mercy of the wind.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.400
Why don't we listen for
the voices of the wind?

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:19.860
Good morning.

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.960
Ah, good morning.

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.400
Hey, Satoru,

01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:28.840
you're different than the other
elites from Japan, you know?

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.210
You're always modest.

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:36.110
- You think?
- Yes.

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:38.750
I've never met anyone
like you before.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:40.950
You're fast and
accurate in your work,

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:43.820
but you never show off.

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:47.690
Your American
colleagues have begun

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:49.460
to notice your work ethic.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.700
And it seems to me they're
now feeling like they need

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.700
to raise the level
of their work performance.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:12:58.800
I'm just trying to do my best.

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:04.740
Hey, have you gotten a
chance to go to Blue Note yet?

01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:09.010
Hey, Ichijo!

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.010
Yes, sir.

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.350
Can you take care of this?

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:16.450
Of course.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.190
Hey, about what we discussed.

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:23.990
Still workin' on it.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.330
- I'm counting on you.
- I'm on it.

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:27.060
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sorry to interrupt you.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.400
Sir, will you stay as well?

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.630
Mm-hmm.

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:31.500
Are you planning to
use commercial paper

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.140
to finance a local project
here in the United States

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.240
without the proper approval
from the Japanese bank,

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.570
in order to avoid the
higher interest rate?

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.580
So what?

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.010
Totally unacceptable!

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.620
Don't we need to have
head office approval

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.080
for this type of transaction?

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.490
Yes, but there's no way
the head office would approve

01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:51.250
of this if we asked.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.560
We want to finance this project
locally with Sunny Bank,

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.860
without bothering
the head office.

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.630
We'll get a huge infusion
of funds at a cheaper rate.

01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:59.800
Ends justify the means.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.300
With all due respect,

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.930
we need to at least speak
with our main bank about this.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.300
They have a branch right
here in New York City.

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.000
If they think we've
gone behind their backs,

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.440
they're sure to retaliate.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.210
Japanese banks are inflexible
and not worth the trouble.

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:14.510
The foreign banks
work a lot faster.

01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:15.580
We can't do this!

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.850
They finance us with billions.

01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:18.550
If we make them lose
face, by doing this,

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:20.180
our relationship will be ruined.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.190
You have to look
at the big picture,

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.020
not just see what's
beneficial now.

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:31.030
Looking back now,

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:33.400
I guess he had the
better judgment.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.700
The head office was
furious with us.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.300
And I was sent back to
Tokyo because of it.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.800
I remember.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.310
I heard that he was the only
one who opposed the deal.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.240
One mistake will get
you sent home, right away,

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.880
which you'd want to avoid.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.410
He came back and
declined the offer

01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:51.050
to become a resident officer.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.680
A resident officer?

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.990
No one has ever
been offered that.

01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:00.320
If you decide to take it,

01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:03.060
it's five years in New York.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.960
Five more years?

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:09.870
Can I afford to stay in New
York for five more years?

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.870
What's wrong?

01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:19.040
I'm honored that
you've offered me this.

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.860
You, you turned it down?

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.130
Do you know it's a huge
promotion when they ask you

01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:40.060
to be a resident officer?

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.100
I know, Tina.

01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:44.470
But I need to go back to Japan.

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.440
Is that really what you want?

01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:52.070
It's okay, Tina.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.610
Thanks for everything.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:57.110
Hey, Timmy!

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:01.380
You've been such a pain in
the neck over the past year,

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.520
but I think I understand now.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.220
It's not that you're a bad
person or anything like that.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.330
You're just a country bumpkin.

01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:19.840
It's his way of
complimenting you.

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.340
Here, let me pin it on you.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.110
Thank you.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.960
Mr. Goto, congratulations,
it's well-deserved.

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.790
Mr. Isobe, so good to see you.

01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:42.930
President of
Sumiyoshi Bank, right?

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:44.290
Thank you so much
for coming tonight.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.860
I truly appreciate
your presence.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.030
I'm glad to be here.

01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:50.300
The Toho Company has always
been a special client

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.330
of our bank.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.400
Thank you so much.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:58.210
Do you still remember when
we gave your company loans

01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:01.140
at the prime rate for the
first time in history?

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:04.010
Ah, that was
because of Satoru.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:07.780
I'm sure that he's
greatly missed

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.320
by all in your company.

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.130
Sumiyoshi Bank, Ningyocho Branch

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:15.960
Tokyo, 1983

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.230
Back in
Japan, Satoru worked

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:18.590
in the finance division
as a negotiator

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.960
in charge of 20 major banks.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:25.300
Can we please discuss
the interest rate?

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.640
The prime rate is what
we'd like to have.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.810
The prime rate, huh, really?

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.740
I don't think that can happen.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.950
In an environment
rife with variables,

01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:39.580
I'm afraid most companies
have exposure to risk,

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.050
so we can't just-

01:17:41.050 --> 01:17:42.790
- However, the prime rate is

01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:44.690
what you offer the most
creditworthy companies.

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:46.120
Isn't that right?

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.760
Our trading firm has sales
that rank seventh in the world,

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.860
and we're very strong
with our cash flow

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:52.900
and firm financial footing.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.730
I believe we're among
the most creditworthy.

01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:57.770
It's all in the report
in front of you.

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:05.270
While it's true the prime
rate is occasionally offered

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.180
to a few of the most creditworthy
companies in our business,

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.450
the truth is we only offer
it to our own affiliates.

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:14.980
That doesn't make sense.

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.290
The prime rate is meant
for blue chip companies

01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:19.090
who are strong enough
to borrow from banks

01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:20.920
with minimal risk to you.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.730
If you can offer
that rate to us,

01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:24.790
we'll make you the first
bank of choice for all

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.700
- future financial needs.
- That would be

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.930
quite unprecedented,
coming here alone

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:33.070
and making a demand like
that without company backing.

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.070
Excuse me, sir.

01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:36.910
I do not lie ever.

01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:38.110
On behalf of my company,

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:39.740
when I say yes, the deal's done,

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.110
when I say no, it's finished,

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:42.580
there are no other choices.

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.380
My decisions are absolute.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:47.950
I came here with full authority
to make a final decision.

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:57.190
Finance Division

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.100
Please excuse me, ma'am.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.030
Could you tell me

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.170
where Mr. Ichijo's desk is?

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:06.070
Of course.

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:07.870
Right there.

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:09.810
Thank you.

01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:22.490
That's the Sumiyoshi
Bank branch manager.

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:25.320
The branch where all of
Sumiyoshi's execs are assigned?

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.990
Isn't he a board member too?

01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:29.430
Hello.

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:31.990
I like how you
drink up that way.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.600
Mr. Isobe.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.500
You must be Satoru
Ichijo, correct?

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.400
Yes.

01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:39.900
I'm told my staff was unable

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.940
to counter your
argument the other day.

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.110
I'm not
sure what to do.

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:48.740
Mr. Isobe, as I
said the other day.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.150
I'm fully aware
that your profits

01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:52.010
from us will decline a little.

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:55.450
But we are as creditworthy
as Sumiyoshi Trading,

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:59.320
your affiliate, or any company
with which you do business.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.090
There's no rule that says the
prime rate can only be offered

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:03.930
to your affiliates.

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:06.060
You're required to
post all the companies

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.000
that receive the
prime rate from you.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.170
I'm sorry to keep
you waiting, Mr. Isobe.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.670
How can we be of help to you?

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.580
I'm good.

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:24.150
I only came here to see
what kind of person he is.

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:26.520
I was just leaving.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.120
Ah, okay?

01:20:31.690 --> 01:20:34.190
You've got a good
man right there.

01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:35.090
Ah.

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:03.590
Satoru,
how have you been?

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.190
I've been visiting publishers,

01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:09.530
showing them your
spiritual messages.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.260
But because of the content,

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:17.300
I haven't been able to find one
that will publish your book.

01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:24.810
They all say that with so
many messages from God,

01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:26.380
it's too good to be true.

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.580
But I'll keep doing what I can.

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:33.250
Don't get discouraged.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:34.950
And keep working hard.

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:40.720
Love, Dad.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.590
Buddha

01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:15.060
The Developmental Stages of Love

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.190
Eisaku Isobe, Branch Manager

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.630
My mind's made up.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.170
If we're gonna lose, let's
be graceful about it.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.440
We will apply the
prime rate for you.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.880
Thank you, sir.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.810
We'll have less return
from your company,

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.980
but I think that we
can cover the loss

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:42.820
from our other contacts.

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:44.150
I'll talk to our main office

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.850
and get you
contracts right away.

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:48.020
Thank you very much.

01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:52.560
Although, what do
you want in return?

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.930
In return, we want nothing.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.300
Personally, though, I would like

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.370
to see you rise
to great heights.

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:06.010
That's what I want from this.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:10.950
Sumiyoshi Bank is giving
us the prime rate now?

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:12.850
That has never happened before.

01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:16.520
Yes, the other major
trading companies,

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.250
well, they only
get subprime rates.

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.720
This is highly unusual.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.760
Who negotiated the deal?

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.200
Satoru Ichijo from finance.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.000
Oh, that guy who
was in New York.

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:33.600
So he got the request
approved by the bank?

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.370
He's a real go-getter, isn't he?

01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:37.770
Yes.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:42.040
Yoshizawa got two billion
from the Fujiyama Bank.

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:44.410
And he got that with
interest of 6.8%.

01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:49.150
But Satoru got the
exact same two billion,

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:52.320
except he got 6.3% interest
from the Sumiyoshi Bank.

01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:57.130
That saves us 50
million yen in five years.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.200
That's just exceptional.

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.400
Do you know his career track?

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.570
Yes, the executive track.

01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:07.540
Next month, he goes
to Nagoya branch,

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.670
which is like a more
compact headquarters,

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:11.540
so he'll learn management there.

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.310
It'll be a great place for
him to learn the next step.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.260
In Nagoya,

01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:32.070
Nagoya, 1984

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.690
I met the kindest people of
all my days at the company.

01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:34.130
But I didn't know,
by a twist of fate,

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:35.860
I would end up
suffering the most.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:37.450
Toho Company Co., Ltd.
Nagoya Branch

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.110
Mr. Satoru Ichijo, it was
like you came down from heaven,

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:47.840
just to appear before me,

01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:50.610
but only for a brief moment.

01:24:55.650 --> 01:24:58.750
This is Miho, the branch
manager's secretary.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.960
I have an executive from the
Owari Bank holding on the line.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.090
When I told him that
the manager wasn't here,

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.500
he asked if he could
speak with you instead.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.730
You can put him through.

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:08.800
Thank you very much.

01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.070
Hello, this is Satoru.

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.970
Can I help you?

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.370
Mr. Ichijo again?

01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:17.810
Yes.

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:20.910
He gets all the calls
directly from bank executives.

01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:22.380
It sure seems that way, right?

01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:25.050
He's the elite of the
elites, don't you think so?

01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:27.480
You don't get to meet a
single Tomei grad every day,

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:28.580
and he's good at his job.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.090
What more can you ask?

01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:31.350
I guess.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.860
It's really just that I
wouldn't like him at all

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.820
if he was just another
money-grabbing,

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:38.130
aggressive financial
toady person.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.430
What do you think, Miho?

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.670
I don't know.

01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:46.240
Well, whenever I talk
to him on the telephone,

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.070
he seems like a nice enough guy.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.640
Hey, look, it's Miss
Hard-to-Get, Miho Tachibana.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.050
She is something.

01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:59.050
She's the one who's
turned down dates

01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:00.920
from just about everyone here.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.790
Yeah, but she's so gorgeous.

01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:06.020
Excuse me, but the deputy
manager would like to see you

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.390
in the conference room,
by the end of the day.

01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:08.620
Okay, I'll see him later.

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:09.590
Have a good day.

01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:16.060
Satoru, let's go eat.

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:18.170
Mr. Hinata.

01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:21.170
Ryotaro Shiba, nice.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.260
Ry么ma! Volume I

01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:23.370
Looks like we have the
same taste in books.

01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:25.310
Wow, that means
a lot, coming from you.

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:26.410
Thank you very much.

01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:29.110
So what's goin' on?

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.380
I see that Miho's been coming

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.180
to your desk quite often lately.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.720
Oh no, it's not like that.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.190
She's just doing
her job, paperwork.

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:42.060
Oh!

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.860
I wish I were young again.

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.860
Let's go.

01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:45.760
Uh, sure.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.370
While
Satoru was climbing

01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:56.070
up the bright career ladder,

01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:59.370
things were far from
glamorous here in Kawashima.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.510
Spiritual Messages from Kukai

01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:13.460
So, by the way,

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:18.560
I'm thinking about
opening a tutoring school.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.530
A tutoring school?

01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:21.900
Mm-hmm.

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.670
And once we get
our business going,

01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:26.940
we'll be able to support you,
and you can leave your job.

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.870
I mean, the one
thing I was good at

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:30.110
was studying, at least.

01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:31.970
So the two of you
think you're ready

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.710
to start a new business.

01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:36.250
Starting a business

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:38.450
doesn't always guarantee
success, you know.

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:44.290
With this business plan,

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:49.790
you'll go bankrupt
in three years.

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:51.760
Don't do it.

01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:59.730
Toho Company

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.320
Contributed Articles

01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:11.660
By Satoru Ichijo,
New York Branch

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.480
Sharing the greatest legacy.

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.960
As a legacy
to the next generations,

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.300
I may not leave them my
money, business, or thoughts,

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:30.500
but I hope people
will tell the story

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:34.370
of a man named Satoru
Ichijo who was born in Japan

01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:36.340
to serve the next generations.

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:41.340
His courageous yet graceful
life became a legacy

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:42.240
for the world.

01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:45.550
That's how I want
to be remembered.

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:49.280
Incredible.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.160
You have quite the philosophical
side to you, Mr. Ichijo.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.190
Huh?

01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.530
I read your article

01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:01.160
in the company
newsletter, the other day,

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.300
which was published a while ago.

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.600
Oh no, I didn't
know it was sent here.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.940
No, I think it's amazing.

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.370
Hmm?

01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:11.640
I'd like to make a
difference in this world,

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.780
something meaningful
to let everyone know

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:16.180
that I was here and existed.

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.510
Oh, is that right?

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.250
Actually, I'm thinking
about leaving this company

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.960
and be independent someday.

01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:29.390
Independent?

01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:31.760
Yes, I used to think

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.300
that I would eventually
find a special someone

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.160
that I would want
to devote my life to

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:37.930
and of course get married,

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.270
but I can't seem to meet anyone.

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:41.500
Oh.

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:42.770
I want to move in
another direction

01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:45.070
and work on honing my skills.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:48.680
Oh, please, promise me you
won't tell anyone about this.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.980
Oh, of course not.

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:53.350
You're really smart, talented,

01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:55.420
and a person beaming
with confidence.

01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:58.790
I'm sure you'll be successful
in whatever field you choose.

01:29:59.690 --> 01:30:01.220
- Oh, you think so?
- Mm.

01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:03.290
Maybe I could be a journalist.

01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:04.460
It would be amazing

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.560
to tell the world
everything I've learned

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.100
and all that I've discovered.

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:09.430
That would be amazing.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.140
But why are you
telling me your dreams?

01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:18.210
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:20.910
I don't know why.

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.410
But, for some reason, I just,

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:26.480
I just felt like telling you.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.820
Oh.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.230
I knew you'd come to
this event, Miss Nakamura.

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:39.800
Of course.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.030
What I recall, Satoru
was like god himself.

01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:46.540
That's how I saw him.

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.940
You see, back then,

01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:52.410
actually, in the dorm,
I was bullied a lot.

01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:53.640
Look what you did!

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.980
Why are you so slow?

01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:01.880
Get back to work now!

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.700
Mom, no, don't do it!

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.540
I'm sorry, so sorry.

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.150
Good morning.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.320
I should end my life

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.550
and my daughter's.

01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:37.990
Hey there.

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:43.990
Stay strong.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.530
What?

01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:47.560
I'm going.

01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:51.930
But I'll be back by six.

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:52.930
That sounds good.

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:56.400
Have a good day.

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:57.640
Here, I'll take that.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.510
Ah, thank you.

01:31:59.610 --> 01:32:00.440
See you later.

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:08.120
He must know
everything about me.

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:24.200
Hi there.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:26.200
I'm back now.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.570
Oh, welcome back.

01:32:34.410 --> 01:32:35.980
Listen.

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.110
I told the department
you did nothing wrong.

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.880
So don't worry, you'll be fine.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.520
You really did that for me?

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.220
Oh, I cannot thank you enough.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.720
If I were to lose my job here,

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:52.660
I wouldn't be able to
support my daughter.

01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:53.930
Don't worry.

01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:55.530
You've been so very kind to me.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.800
I really appreciate that.

01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:05.170
Thank you.

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.410
Miss Nagoya Beauty Contest!

01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:10.880
Shh!

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.280
Oh, sorry.

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.520
There's a chance that it
just might help my career

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.790
in the future.

01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:19.690
So I'm thinking about
entering the contest.

01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:21.160
Oh, I see.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.860
I really respect your courage
doing something like this.

01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:25.030
But do you think I
have chance of winning?

01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:27.730
Yeah, I'm sure you'll
be the next Miss Nagoya,

01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:29.900
or at least you'll be
the first runner up.

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:35.040
Mr. Ichijo, would you
mind taking me to the venue.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.310
I don't know why, but
if you'd come along,

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:39.610
I feel like I might have
a chance of winning.

01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:46.350
You mean, you pointed out
the flaw of Mako Bank's logic?

01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:50.050
Yes, the 8% fixed rate
was outrageously high.

01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:52.250
They'd been demanding
that for way too long,

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.460
and it's costing us.

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.160
We're losing money
on a bad deal.

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:57.730
They're too arrogant for
us to keep on as clients.

01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:00.630
You are a hard
negotiator, Satoru.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.030
I guess that means we're
going to have to cut them off.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.670
We gonna be okay?

01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:09.140
Don't worry about it.

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.410
I'd never make a decision

01:34:10.410 --> 01:34:12.410
that could hurt this
company in any way.

01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:13.640
Hmm.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.210
We may lose Mako
because of this,

01:34:15.210 --> 01:34:17.050
but I've already had a
meeting with Maruyama Bank

01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:18.650
to fill the void.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.390
Ah, congratulations.

01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:29.060
Thank you.

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.660
But I didn't win the top prize.

01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:34.730
Yeah, but I told you,
Miss Nagoya or runner-up.

01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:37.630
And you were right.

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.770
By coming in second,
you'll stay humble

01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:41.640
and prepare for the
next opportunity,

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.200
so you can fly even higher

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.610
and achieve a bigger
success in the future.

01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:48.910
And that's one way to
look at it, I suppose.

01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:53.010
I must say you really
are stoic, Mr. Ichijo.

01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:58.590
Oh, let me take your picture,

01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:59.920
just one or two.

01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:03.660
Maybe right over here?

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:04.490
Okay.

01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:05.560
I got it.

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.630
Thank you.

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:10.870
A little bit to the left.

01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:11.770
Okay.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.700
Ready?

01:35:14.670 --> 01:35:16.970
Now.

01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:18.440
One more?

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.640
Say cheese.

01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:30.120
Let's see what we got.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.920
The developmental
stages of love?

01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:39.360
The love I
speak of is the kind

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.500
of love you keep
giving to others,

01:35:42.630 --> 01:35:44.130
unconditional love.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.770
But I believe there are
four stages of love.

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:52.370
"Fundamental love,
nurturing love.

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:54.440
After that, there's
forgiving love.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.410
And finally, you will
reach love incarnate.

01:35:57.410 --> 01:36:00.980
This is my theory of the
development stages of love."

01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:03.220
Ah, don't read it out so loud.

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:05.720
No one has ever written
about love before,

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:08.090
especially not in the
company newsletter.

01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:10.990
Actually, I don't think
there's anyone like you,

01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:13.960
at our company or any
other company in the world.

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:16.100
Are you giving
me a compliment?

01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.600
Yes, of course.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.800
Hey, according to this,

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.570
love between a man and a woman
is part of fundamental love.

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.240
So does that mean it's just
the first stage of love?

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.580
Mm, that's right.

01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:32.010
Romantic love or neighborly
love is the most basic stage.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.320
It's the easiest for
everyone to practice.

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.020
The most basic stage.

01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:37.720
Then there's nurturing love.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.220
It guides people
to a better place.

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:43.560
Forgiving love teaches you
to forgive your enemies.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.630
When one reaches love incarnate,

01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:48.660
your very existence becomes
the spirit of the age,

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:51.370
the highest form of love in
the developmental stages.

01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:53.470
Okay.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.300
I guess that, for you,

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:59.070
romantic love is a
very low level of love.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.750
Uh, sorry, that's not true.

01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:04.980
It's not true?

01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:06.710
Well, I mean,

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.780
the time that we get to
spend together is important,

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.120
at least, to me, it is.

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:15.490
You're
just being nice to me.

01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:19.890
Should we go back now?

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:20.800
Yes.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.240
Ah, thank you.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.640
Hello.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.710
Ah, Father.

01:37:35.710 --> 01:37:37.350
Yeah, I'm really good.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.510
I'm home!

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.650
Yeah?

01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:44.290
You finally found a publisher?

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.360
Ichijo Tutoring School

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.290
Yes, I did.

01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:52.360
It's a small independent called
Ryubin Publishing Company.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.800
They say they'll publish
your spiritual messages.

01:37:55.250 --> 01:38:00.290
Spiritual Messages from Nichiren

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.230
You can use my name if you want,

01:37:57.230 --> 01:37:59.570
so your company won't
find out about it.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440
It's happening.

01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:03.910
Amazing, that's great.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.210
Father, thank you.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.580
Mm, yeah.

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:14.880
Yes!

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.850
Oh, Mr. Hinata,

01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:18.750
- good night.
- Huh?

01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:24.790
Yeah, I used to think that
I had him all figured out.

01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:27.130
But I realized that I
didn't know him at all.

01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:29.360
Yeah, but I think

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:32.200
that we both felt something
about him was special,

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.800
and it turns out he was.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.670
Yeah, there's one time,

01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:38.840
when his colleagues
went to a hostess club,

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.310
Satoru had a car, so they
talked him into driving them

01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:43.110
to the place, that
night.

01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:44.350
Ah.

01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:46.250
But then, on the
way to the club,

01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:48.580
they decided to make a
U-turn and head home.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.690
Being with him made them
feel a little bit guilty

01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:53.190
about doing it,

01:38:53.190 --> 01:38:54.490
like clubbing with a monk.

01:38:56.290 --> 01:38:58.790
He worked so hard,
as a businessman

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.400
and was even studious
in his private life.

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:03.900
He sure was.

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:04.800
Yeah.

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:30.190
Oh my.

01:39:30.190 --> 01:39:32.890
Satoru continues
to buy more books.

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.150
Oh, I had no idea, Satoru.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.870
Poems by Satoru Ichijo
"Love: Before and After"

01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:03.520
Self-publish!

01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:07.000
I've been writing
poems since college.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.130
I wanted to publish
them as a book.

01:40:09.130 --> 01:40:10.330
That's fantastic.

01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:11.830
That's awesome.

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.240
All right, I'm gonna go
out and promote them.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.800
Oh, thanks so much.

01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:17.340
Listen up!

01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:20.310
Who wants to read
Satoru's poems?

01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:21.510
Satoru writes too?

01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:23.340
- Huh? Satoru?
- You really need

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:24.550
to read this.

01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:25.880
Maybe I'll give it a read.

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:26.910
- Okay, I'll take a look.
- And you too!

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:30.550
You wrote this one
for a girl you were

01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:32.850
in love with in
college, didn't you?

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:34.020
What?

01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:35.260
How'd you know that?

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:37.660
It's pretty obvious
when you look at it.

01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:41.730
In any case, I'm sure that she
was happy to be loved by you.

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:46.830
I don't know.

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.570
Hey, is this about me?

01:40:48.710 --> 01:40:50.420
Sacred Girl

01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:53.940
Why no, of course not.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.110
Sorry, I gotta go.

I'll take this.

01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:38.720
Thank you.

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.020
It's 980 yen.

01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:42.360
Would you like a cover?

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.590
- Yes, please.
- All right,

01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:44.930
let me get it for you,
I'll be right back.

01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:46.030
So what was it

01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:49.830
that made him decide
to leave our company?

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.200
Was he upset about
being sent to Nagoya?

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.100
No, that wasn't it.

01:41:55.110 --> 01:41:57.210
He was back in
Tokyo for a while.

01:41:57.210 --> 01:41:59.670
After that, we were
talking about sending him

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:01.140
to Germany for a little while.

01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:02.940
Hmm?

01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:05.250
If I remember correctly,

01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:08.320
didn't he write a future
plan for the company

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.450
while he was in Nagoya.

01:42:09.450 --> 01:42:10.650
Am I correct?

01:42:10.650 --> 01:42:13.290
Yes, it was a
fantastic proposal.

01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:15.820
That's why we called
him back to Tokyo.

01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:18.630
This is gonna be passed
way up the ladder.

01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:21.730
My only concern is
what the CEO will say.

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:29.400
Basically, in the long run,

01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:31.410
property prices will go down.

01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:33.640
If we keep investing
heavily in property,

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.210
it'll lead to
financial instability.

01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:39.450
The exchange rate is
currently 240 yen per dollar.

01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:43.680
In a few years, it'll be under
200, in the 190 yen range.

01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:45.590
That's so ridiculous.

01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:49.790
It'll be 250, or it
might go back to 300 yen.

01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:51.290
No.

01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:54.660
I'm thinking, eventually,
it might even be under 100.

01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.930
We need to plan
ahead, just in case.

01:42:58.070 --> 01:43:00.130
I'm not sure the
CEO will approve

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.440
of such a drastic
change right now.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.610
The final decision is his.

01:43:04.610 --> 01:43:06.310
But for the future
of the company,

01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:07.610
I think he should
at least listen

01:43:07.610 --> 01:43:09.240
to his staff's recommendations.

01:43:10.110 --> 01:43:12.210
Well, at this point,

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.620
I don't think that your
idea is gonna be approved.

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:18.690
But I have high
expectations for you.

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.460
Keep working hard at your job,

01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:25.760
and you'll be leading this
company in the near future.

I know.

01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:04.530
So you bought one, too, huh?

01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:05.670
Yup, I was curious.

01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:14.840
Hey, Miho, have you seen this?

to start teaching the
truth to the world?

01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.870
Should I follow my calling?

01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:46.970
Or should I stay and follow
the path of my career?

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:49.510

to help you.

01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:55.480
It's just...

01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:58.850
You're kind-hearted,

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:00.790
so you feel like
you owe the company

01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:02.820
for investing so much into you.

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:06.390
Yes.

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:10.770
Oh.

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:14.700
Satoru,
are you in there?

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:15.670
Yes.

01:45:15.670 --> 01:45:16.940
Can I come in?

01:45:22.810 --> 01:45:23.880
Mr. Hinata.

01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:30.550
Ah.

01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:32.890
You seem to be a
little down, lately.

01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:35.020
I'm a really good listener.

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:36.560
Thank you.

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.260
But I'm fine, thanks.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:42.930
So, what's this?

01:45:42.930 --> 01:45:44.800
A broken heart, possibly?

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.130
Oh, no.

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.340
It's not what it seems.

01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:54.310
Miho sure is cute.

01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:57.210
Honestly, I wonder,

01:45:58.550 --> 01:46:01.520
if any woman can live up to
someone as virtuous as you are.

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:02.420
Huh?

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:05.250
What do you mean by that?

01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:07.150
Yeah, not that
I know anything.

01:46:08.290 --> 01:46:10.760
But you work 10 times
harder than all of us.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:14.060
And you're always studying
at some insane level, too.

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.260
I mean,
look at this room.

01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:18.770
If Miho saw it, I bet
she'd be horrified.

01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:21.770
That's true.

01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:23.970
Oh, oh, sorry.

01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:24.870
Are you okay?

01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:27.310
You see?

01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:28.210
I'm so sorry.

01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:32.550
You've
got so many books here.

01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:34.350
You've read them all, right?

01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:35.920
Yes.

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:37.450

And Miho is, too.

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:16.420
Bring them over here.

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:17.930
Okay.

01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:20.360
Hey, Satoru, you need to go over

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.630
and ask Miho to dance with you.

01:47:22.630 --> 01:47:24.030
Oh, no, I could never.

01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:25.230
Sure, you can.

01:47:25.230 --> 01:47:26.700
We're just the guys
to help you out.

01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:30.070
Hey, Miho, will you dance
with this guy, please?

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:35.340
Yes.

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.280
- Huh?
- Good for you.

01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:58.100
So what are you laughing at?

01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:00.530
It's, it's just
that you're actually

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:02.640
- a really good dancer.
- No.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.750
I told you that
if I met someone

01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:17.520
that I could devote my life to,

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.320
I wouldn't have to
have a career myself.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.960
Do you remember me saying that?

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.430
I'm starting to think
that maybe I don't have

01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:25.660
to become a journalist.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:27.900
What?

01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:35.000
You're
the Buddha reborn.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.170
Your mission is to save all
people by spreading the truth.

01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:39.600
Buddha

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.440
Unify all religions on earth

01:48:42.450 --> 01:48:45.450
to establish a
new world religion

01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:48.280
and open a path to
a new civilization.

01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:05.630
You've been working
hard towards your dreams,

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:08.770
and I think that I
like that Miho better.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:13.740
So,

01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:16.940
are you sure?

01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:19.480
I am, yeah.

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.790
I can't bear to see you leave
everything you've strived for,

01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:27.920
for the dreams of another.

01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:01.520
Tell me.

01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:06.130
Who are you really?

01:50:10.230 --> 01:50:13.600
I can't say yet,
not even to you.

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.770
Then when will you tell me?

01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:22.810
Please, just give
me a little more time.

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:29.850
Understood.

01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:34.120
Hey, can you foresee my future?

01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:36.960
You can actually
see it, can't you?

01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:40.130
What are you talking about?

01:50:40.130 --> 01:50:41.000
Please.

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:45.130
Won't you do it just this once?

01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:56.580
All right, just a little.

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.560
Please let me see it.

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.160
Show this person's future.

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:29.140
KTT Flash News time.

01:51:29.150 --> 01:51:31.350
Miho Tachibana reporting
from the studio.

01:51:33.650 --> 01:51:34.780
Okay, great!

01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:38.150
Thanks a lot.

01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:41.590
- Thank you.
- Good job.

01:51:41.590 --> 01:51:43.520
- Thank you so much.
- You did great.

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:44.960
Really?

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.030
Yeah, can we do a
little meeting after this?

01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:54.170
What is it?

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:57.500
Did you see something
that was horrible?

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:59.740
Oh, no, not at all.

01:52:04.210 --> 01:52:06.010
It looked like you'll be

01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.080
a successful
television broadcaster.

01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:12.520
And you'll also be blessed
with a nice family.

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:15.560
Did you see who it is
I'm going to be with?

01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:16.460
No.

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.930
I'm sorry.

01:52:19.930 --> 01:52:20.990
I couldn't see that.

01:52:31.170 --> 01:52:32.070
I see.

01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:39.980
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:41.620
It's so late.

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:42.650
I'll take you home.

01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:52.590
What?

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:53.490
It won't open.

01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:58.770
If it won't open, that means...

01:53:00.570 --> 01:53:02.100
It's no problem.

01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:04.000
I can get home on
my own. Don't worry.

01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:05.370
Wait a second.

01:53:05.370 --> 01:53:06.810
I'm sure I can get it open.

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.220
I hate to say this.

01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:21.290
It looks like we'll have

01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:23.520
to go our separate
ways now, Satoru.

01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:31.200
Thank you for a wonderful time.

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.770
Goodbye.

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:57.120
Ah, I live my life with faith in you

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.170
It's so fragile

01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:02.630
So hard

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:07.180
So vain

01:54:07.630 --> 01:54:11.850
If I am allowed to

01:54:12.010 --> 01:54:16.640
Do what I could do

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:21.440
At all cost

01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:20.210
I'm starting to think

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.620
that maybe I don't have
to become a journalist.

01:54:21.610 --> 01:54:24.990
I will devote my life

01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:26.920
Who are you really?

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.350
It looks like we'll have to
go our separate ways now.

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:30.590
Thank you for a wonderful time.

01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:31.070
To you

01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:33.080
Let my love

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.660
Goodbye.

01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:37.960
Burn inside

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:43.000
How could my longing

01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:47.670
Possibly be your obstacle?

01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:52.300
Oh no

01:54:52.470 --> 01:55:00.480
I can't forgive myself

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:10.530
Ah Ah Ah
I have to let go of my love

01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:13.700
That must be

01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.700
Good work.

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.790
The way

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:15.600
Need a ride?

01:55:16.610 --> 01:55:17.910
No, thanks. I'm okay.

01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:18.750
I have to

01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:18.910
Okay.

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:20.960
Choose

01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:19.810
Take care.

01:55:21.210 --> 01:55:29.220
No matter where
I am in this world

01:55:23.210 --> 01:55:25.850
All right, pack it up.

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:33.390
Satoru, your
prediction came true.

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.680
My soul

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.760
Will be

01:55:35.490 --> 01:55:37.360
But on that day,

01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:39.850
Always with you

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:40.130
weren't you trying to tell
me something important?

01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:44.060
Guiding your way

01:55:44.690 --> 01:55:51.490
December 8, 1985

01:55:49.810 --> 01:55:53.640
Maybe I should stay
at the company until I'm 45.

01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:56.810
Then when I leave as
a company executive,

01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:00.410
it'll be easier for people
to trust and follow me.

01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:03.720
Absolutely.

01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:07.960
You'll most likely be
an executive in your 40s

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.460
and may eventually
become president.

01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:15.930
By staying there, you'll
make many people happy.

01:56:18.730 --> 01:56:19.570
The happy couple!

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.470
Is that my
future if I keep my job?

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.410
If you quit now,

01:56:28.410 --> 01:56:30.540
it will all have
been for nothing.

01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:34.210
You'll betray those
who trusted you.

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.080
We are putting our
heads together now,

01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:38.120
working on a solution.

01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.090
We're trying our best to
minimize the loss now, sir.

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:47.560
Your family
will be reduced to poverty.

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:54.470
You won't be able to make
Miho Tachibana happy.

01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:57.970
If you can't even make
the woman you love happy,

01:56:57.970 --> 01:57:00.940
how can you make
the world happy?

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:02.480
Stop it!

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:04.910
It's my job to bring
happiness to everybody.

01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:09.850
Keep your job
and get promoted to the top.

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:13.990
You should earn a
sufficient income

01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:16.720
and marry the one you love.

01:57:16.730 --> 01:57:18.760
You've worked so hard.

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:21.630
You deserve respect and power.

01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.970
That's what real
human happiness is.

01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:32.440
That's what real
human happiness is?

01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:38.680
I know now.

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.580
You're the devil!

01:57:58.530 --> 01:58:03.540
Insolent boy, how could
someone like you become a savior?

01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:07.010
Through my entire life,

01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:08.880
have I lived in a
way that causes me

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.410
to be targeted by the devil?

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.580
No, I've always been
diligent and done my best.

01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:40.540
Nevertheless, a powerful devil
came to obstruct my path.

01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:48.380
This, in fact, is proof
that my mission is real.

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:52.920
Devil, the fact that
you're attacking me

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:56.420
so fiercely now means
that it's time for me

01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:58.360
to stand up for
what I believe in!

01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:21.550
I will destroy this devil.

01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:26.390
And I will attain
enlightenment here and now.

01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:30.390
You, devil, get away now!

01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:33.690
Get away now!

02:00:20.810 --> 02:00:22.210
I don't need an income.

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:25.580
Die for the truth.

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.480
I won't be afraid
of losing my life.

02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:30.620
I don't need a career.

02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:32.150
I don't need a reputation.

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:35.260
I don't care what
others say about me.

02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.660
I'll abandon everything
I have in this life

02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:39.360
and die at this moment.

02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:45.830
This was my second
death, at the age of 30.

02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:49.800
I decided to give up everything

02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:52.210
and start empty-handed.

02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:04.420
Here you go.

02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:05.750
Ah, thank you.

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:18.970
I'll be right back.

02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:22.770
Kantoh TV made me an offer.

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:25.710
Oh, that's wonderful.

02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:28.940
Mm.

02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:32.510
Hey, let me buy
you lunch today.

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:34.610
Thank you.

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:40.120
Then I'll have the curry.

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:42.360
Are you sure that's
all you're going to eat?

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:43.260
Mm-hmm.

02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:50.530
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.

02:01:50.530 --> 02:01:54.570
It's good.

02:01:54.570 --> 02:01:56.500
Mm!

02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:58.740
It is good.

02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:03.610
I had fun today. Thank you.

02:02:04.710 --> 02:02:06.480
Next time, it'll be on me.

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.880
Okay, but not the curry.

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:09.780
All right.

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:16.620
So, see ya.

02:02:16.630 --> 02:02:17.520
Yes.

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.740
I had no idea that day was going

02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:39.410
to be the last time I'd see him.

02:02:41.650 --> 02:02:45.450
He was aiming for something
I couldn't even imagine.

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.920
And on that day, he
disappeared from my life.

02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:34.410
Mr. Osamu Hinata

02:03:54.490 --> 02:03:57.790
Mr. Hinata, I'm
being sent back to Tokyo.

02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:02.330
But I wanted to tell
you that I'm planning

02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:03.560
to quit the company.

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.700
Alongside my work
at the company,

02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:10.270
I've been in contact with heaven

02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:12.470
and publishing
messages from spirits.

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:18.580
I apologize for hiding my
activities from you, my friend.

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.550
But it's time for me to leave.

02:04:26.590 --> 02:04:28.620
For the next several decades,

02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:31.930
I'll be teaching the truth to
lead humanity to happiness.

02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.830
I am destined to become
a religious leader.

02:04:36.670 --> 02:04:37.900
Please understand.

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:46.810
P.S., please give
my regards to Miho.

02:05:08.630 --> 02:05:11.090
Letter of resignation

02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:10.500
Please.

02:05:12.670 --> 02:05:14.200
Hey, is this-

02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:16.270
- Thank you for everything.

02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:18.400
No, wait.

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:21.140
Hey, Satoru, come back!

02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:22.040
Satoru!

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:28.720
Mr. Goto!

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.580
Satoru submitted this.

02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:32.850
Did you stop him?

02:05:32.850 --> 02:05:34.350
I tried.

02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:36.690
How could you let this happen?

02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:02.720
Spiritual Messages from Jesus Christ

02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:15.190
Hey, Timmy!

02:06:23.310 --> 02:06:26.840
Tell me this isn't true.

02:06:30.110 --> 02:06:31.540
I only speak the truth.

02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:35.350
That is what actually happened.

02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:38.050
Sorry for insulting you,

02:06:38.050 --> 02:06:41.320
it's just I had no
idea you were so holy.

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.760
And me as well.

02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:45.220
I thought you were trying
to get a promotion.

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:58.810
It was
July 15th, 1986.

02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:01.870
I had just turned
30 on July 7th.

02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:06.580
I quit my job and took a
step forward into freedom.

02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:09.580
The Laws of the Sun

02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:20.090
I decided to devote my life

02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:21.930
to teaching the
truth to the world.

02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:24.330
The activity that started

02:07:24.330 --> 02:07:28.130
from my tiny studio apartment
quickly spread far and wide.

02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:27.850
The Ushigome Public Hall

02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:29.850
The Hibiya Public Hall

02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.860
Ryogoku Kokugikan

02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:33.860
Makuhari Messe

02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:42.850
Now is the time to
spread God's words

02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:44.280
to the whole world.

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:51.380
July 15, 1991

02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:21.790
Because I am your
eternal master.

02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:39.340
That was

02:08:40.130 --> 02:08:42.510
And that is

02:08:43.050 --> 02:08:51.060
A very harsh path

02:08:54.150 --> 02:09:02.150
No one understands me

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:10.040
Not even my best friends

02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:15.540
Not even my family

02:09:16.130 --> 02:09:19.170
Not even my girlfriend

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:27.300
No one understands me

02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:35.190
I must go with myself

02:09:35.690 --> 02:09:42.150
I must go with myself

02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:47.070
How could I tell anyone

02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:55.330
How tough it is

02:09:55.540 --> 02:10:00.250
I am all alone

02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:07.680
Training myself over and over

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:15.810
I must walk this path alone

02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:24.110
From the midnight darkness

02:10:24.570 --> 02:10:29.700
I come out

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:35.120
Believing

02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:40.790
Daybreak will come

02:10:41.250 --> 02:10:46.760
I must go with myself

02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:52.600
I am lonely

02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:58.350
I feel loneliness

02:10:58.690 --> 02:11:06.700
I must go with myself

02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:17.830
When I walk alone

02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:24.670
No one knows my loneliness

02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:30.300
Father, Mother, Brother

02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:35.220
My colleagues, my boss

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:40.810
My beloved

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:46.530
You'll only see me from a distance

02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:54.660
As I gradually

02:11:56.540 --> 02:12:04.550
Fade out of your sight

02:12:08.050 --> 02:12:16.060
In the dark before daybreak

02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:24.650
Not knowing where I go
Or which path I take

02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:29.650
Which river I swim across

02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:38.120
Whether I attain the enlightenment

02:12:41.210 --> 02:12:46.250
I never know

02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:54.800
The future is not yet to be seen

02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:03.690
Be persistent

02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:11.610
Be indomitable

02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:19.790
That is how I must live

02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:28.880
Only my will can help

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:36.640
And encourage me

02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:43.100
All I can do is just to walk

02:13:43.230 --> 02:13:51.240
Toward daybreak

02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:59.080
Yes, for sure

02:13:59.330 --> 02:14:04.790
The sun shall rise again

02:14:05.290 --> 02:14:11.090
The sun shall rise again

02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:15.590
Ah Ah Ah

02:14:16.130 --> 02:14:21.270
My twiceborn will come

02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:29.310
I believe it will

02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:36.780
Ah Ah Ah Ah
