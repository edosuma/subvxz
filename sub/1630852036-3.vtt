him leave to go back to school

05:17.550 --> 05:19.318
<i>The victim had been

<i>Lot of blood at the scene.

the victim was a college student

<i>named Richard Bailey.</i>

05:34.434 --> 05:36.268
The sense of urgency is huge.

[Victor] <i>Members of the patrol

06:13.005 --> 06:15.273
<i>trying to see if somebody heard
something or saw something</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:16.742
<i>that was out of the ordinary.</i>

06:19.112 --> 06:20.912
[Jason Vogel]
<i>My first initial thought was</i>

06:20.980 --> 06:22.581
<i>there didn't appear to be</i>

a lot of evidence

06:25.852 --> 06:27.986
[Victor]
<i>After an exhaustive search,</i>

06:28.087 --> 06:31.123
we did not come up
with a murder weapon,

06:31.224 --> 06:34.593
<i>there was no footprints,
no trails of anything</i>

06:34.694 --> 06:37.529
that would have
led us in any direction.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.733
This was gonna be
a whodunnit type of crime.

06:41.834 --> 06:46.271
<i>You were gonna have to dig to

06:49.175 --> 06:51.610
[Victor]<i> The 911 caller</i>
<i>was able to give a statement.</i>

06:51.711 --> 06:53.378
[Dave Rossi]
<i>The witness had heard a shot.</i>

06:53.479 --> 06:56.681
She'd stopped and she'd
seen a couple of individuals

06:56.783 --> 06:59.284
<i>on bicycles, leaving the scene.</i>

06:59.385 --> 07:03.588
She described one of those
individuals as wearing a grey hoodie,

07:03.689 --> 07:06.691
<i>and she indicated which
direction that they were headed.</i>

07:08.060 --> 07:11.396
The next steps for us
were to try to find

07:11.497 --> 07:13.565
<i>some video surveillance.</i>

07:16.402 --> 07:19.204
[Jason]
<i>The video camera's unbiased.</i>

07:19.305 --> 07:21.306
It has no stake in the game.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.343
[Victor] <i>At that point in time,</i>

07:25.445 --> 07:28.280
<i>there wasn't a lot of
home video systems.</i>

07:28.381 --> 07:31.817
So we drove from the scene...

07:31.918 --> 07:35.754
<i>outwards, looking for
any business,</i>

07:35.855 --> 07:39.858
<i>building, street camera
that was in existence.</i>

07:43.963 --> 07:46.331
<i>Time was ticking away.</i>

07:46.432 --> 07:49.267
A lot of video systems back then

07:49.368 --> 07:51.703
<i>didn't hold video for very long.</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:53.939
<i>So we had to move quickly.</i>

07:57.043 --> 08:01.179
[narrator]<i> Pizzola spots some cameras
on the side of an apartment building.</i>

08:01.981 --> 08:04.282
[dramatic music playing]

08:04.383 --> 08:06.551
[Victor]<i> I met</i>
<i>with the building owner...</i>

08:08.087 --> 08:11.857
<i>who granted me access
to the DVR.</i>

08:11.958 --> 08:15.193
I'm looking for...
from 10:30 p.m. to midnight.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.530
Thank you.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.766
[dramatic music playing]

08:24.136 --> 08:25.837
<i>Took it back to my office.</i>

08:25.938 --> 08:29.641
<i>Then I had the task of viewing
all of the camera angles.</i>

08:34.380 --> 08:37.382
<i>After watching hours
of the video,</i>

08:37.483 --> 08:39.351
something did
pique our interest.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.919
What?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.555
This could be the key
to cracking this case.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.836
I'm looking for two individuals on
bicycles coming away from the scene.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.039
<i>Your eyes, your attention</i>

09:01.140 --> 09:03.542
<i>is on every frame of the video.</i>

09:05.711 --> 09:08.480
[dramatic music playing]

09:10.683 --> 09:14.519
[music crescendoes]

09:17.924 --> 09:19.357
What?

09:19.458 --> 09:22.260
<i>I see two individuals
traveling south to north,</i>

09:22.361 --> 09:25.597
<i>which was in the direction
away from the crime scene.</i>

09:26.866 --> 09:29.301
<i>Two individuals on bicycles.</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:31.169
<i>Both were wearing hoodies.</i>

09:31.270 --> 09:34.973
But it differed from the
eyewitness statement that gave us

09:35.074 --> 09:37.943
<i>one individual in a grey hoodie.</i>

09:38.044 --> 09:42.213
In our business, we know eyewitness
statements aren't always reliable.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.684
<i>Grey could be black
on a video screen.</i>

09:45.785 --> 09:48.787
So we broaden
our search parameters.

09:48.888 --> 09:53.358
We were hoping that if we
could identify the individuals,

09:53.459 --> 09:56.428
<i>we'd be able to identify the
shooter of Richard Bailey.</i>

09:59.365 --> 10:00.832
What it didn't show us?

10:00.933 --> 10:03.435
It didn't show us
facial recognition.

10:03.536 --> 10:07.238
<i>It really didn't give us
many identifying factors</i>

10:07.340 --> 10:09.908
<i>such as type of bicycles,
any logos</i>

10:10.009 --> 10:13.078
<i>on clothing,
or hats or sneakers.</i>

10:13.179 --> 10:15.981
<i>I only saw individuals
traveling north.</i>

10:16.082 --> 10:18.583
After that,
I didn't know where they went.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.752
[narrator] <i>Hoping to track them,</i>

10:20.853 --> 10:23.822

to another angle.</i>

<i>The second camera was mounted
on the front of the building.</i>

10:27.360 --> 10:30.362
<i>That gives you Washington

[dramatic music playing]

10:41.307 --> 10:44.309
[music crescendoes]

10:45.678 --> 10:49.180
By switching over
to the second camera,

10:49.281 --> 10:53.385
I could see the two individuals on the
bicycles were pedaling pretty quickly,

10:53.486 --> 10:57.055
<i>crossed Washington Avenue, and
continued northbound on Quail Street.</i>

10:58.624 --> 11:00.725

in the case.</i>

11:00.826 --> 11:03.128
<i>By finding these images
on this video,</i>

11:03.229 --> 11:06.398

where we can continue</i>

11:06.499 --> 11:08.233
a video pursuit.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.270
We were going to
use the video systems

11:12.371 --> 11:15.306
and try to follow these
individuals throughout the city,

11:15.408 --> 11:17.709

right to their front door.

police officer and a detective.</i>

11:49.675 --> 11:51.109
Yes?

Being a retired police officer,

12:37.056 --> 12:41.159

to see him like that.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.595
<i>Breaks your heart.</i>

12:43.696 --> 12:46.097
<i>You wish it was you
instead of him.</i>

12:48.134 --> 12:51.369
You know, we...
Anyone of us would have...

12:52.471 --> 12:55.940
took his place
instead of him being there.

12:56.041 --> 12:59.711
So young, and still,
a lot of life ahead of him.

13:04.383 --> 13:08.620
You just... can't believe it
just happened to our family.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.189
Nothing like this
has ever, ever happened.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.592
It's just... total shock
when they explained

13:14.693 --> 13:17.395
<i>exactly how it happened.</i>

the suspects

13:36.382 --> 13:40.118
knew the victim
in some capacity.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.355
Nothing seemed
to have been taken from Rick.

13:44.456 --> 13:47.525
<i>We need to find out if there's
somebody who'd want to do Rick harm.</i>

13:50.529 --> 13:51.529
[Steve] <i>What's this all about?</i>

13:51.630 --> 13:54.065
Rick Bailey has been shot.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.368
[Steve] They were asking me,
you know, the events of the night.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.404
How everything played out,
what did we do.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.472
[Dave]<i> We were obviously</i>
<i>probing to see if...</i>

14:01.574 --> 14:04.409
<i>if we could find any explanation
for what had happened to him.</i>

14:04.510 --> 14:07.545
Was he involved in drugs?
Was he involved in gambling?

14:08.747 --> 14:10.415
No. Nothing like that.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.184
<i>Rick had never
had an enemy in his life.</i>

14:13.285 --> 14:16.154
<i>He barely even got into
arguments with his friends.</i>

14:16.255 --> 14:19.591
For this to happen to him
of all people,

14:19.692 --> 14:21.559
it's just...

14:21.660 --> 14:24.262
It's something I will never
be able to understand.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.832
Because he was, you know,
truly one of the best

14:27.900 --> 14:30.201
<i>and most kind people
that I've ever met.</i>

14:32.605 --> 14:35.073
[Jason]<i> After speaking with
family members and friends,</i>

14:35.174 --> 14:38.042
<i>we were coming back with
no information whatsoever</i>

14:44.450 --> 14:46.784
[Victor]
<i>So any theory was opened.</i>

14:46.886 --> 14:49.888
It could have been
a mugging gone bad.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.857
It could have been
a random act of violence.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.213
<i>There was a robbery that had
taken place over on Ontario Street.</i>

15:15.314 --> 15:17.315
Approximately seven minutes
after Mr. Bailey was shot.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.285
[phone ringing]

15:24.056 --> 15:25.957
Check this out.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.861
The victim of this robbery
reported to the police

15:29.962 --> 15:32.297
that an individual
robbed him with a gun,

15:32.398 --> 15:35.366
struck him with a gun, took his
wallet and then fled the scene.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.605
We were given information
by that victim

15:40.706 --> 15:43.508
that it was a black male

15:43.609 --> 15:46.344
wearing a grey hoodie on a bike.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.948
This could be our guy.

15:50.049 --> 15:53.952
We utilized his description
to narrow down

15:54.053 --> 15:57.155
another area of the city
in which to look for video.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.795
[Dave]<i> We knew we had an
individual out on the streets</i>

16:03.896 --> 16:06.898
pointing guns in people's faces
and that he was willing to kill.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.968
It was important for us to solve
this crime as quickly as we could.

16:11.603 --> 16:15.173
If this individual's pattern of
conduct was gonna continue,

16:15.274 --> 16:18.376
what happened to Richard Bailey
could happen again over and over.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.757
We knew we had two individuals
on bikes

16:32.858 --> 16:35.960
fleeing the scene where Rick
was shot going in one direction.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.332
<i>And now we had another
individual wearing a grey hoodie</i>

16:41.400 --> 16:42.700
<i>in the area.</i>

16:44.370 --> 16:46.804
It was our job to find out
if this was connected.

[narrator]<i> Detectives Pizzola

16:54.847 --> 16:57.582

16:57.683 --> 17:02.053
I continued my video pursuit
northbound on Quail Street

17:02.154 --> 17:05.023
<i>until it took me to the intersection
of Quail Street and Central Avenue.</i>

17:05.124 --> 17:07.392
That intersection
is heavily video-ed.

17:07.493 --> 17:10.194
<i>There's a location called WAMC.</i>

17:10.295 --> 17:13.264
<i>It's a production studio,
radio station.</i>

17:13.365 --> 17:14.665
Let's see what we got.

17:14.767 --> 17:19.771
<i>They had video
which my office had access to.</i>

17:23.242 --> 17:29.547

southbound, looking across Central Avenue.</i>

17:52.304 --> 17:55.073

17:55.174 --> 17:59.577
<i>One crossing the street
just opposite the camera.</i>

18:00.746 --> 18:03.381
<i>And then the other individual
on a small bicycle</i>

18:03.482 --> 18:06.317

18:06.418 --> 18:08.453

of the street.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.525
They seem to be
traveling a little slower.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.761
<i>We were trying to figure out
what this meant.</i>

18:16.862 --> 18:20.698
<i>We were just thinking, if
these individuals were involved,</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:23.668
<i>they now feel comfortable
that they're far enough away</i>

18:23.769 --> 18:25.870
from the scene,
that they can slow down

18:25.971 --> 18:28.005
and not draw attention
to themselves

18:28.107 --> 18:30.374
by running away quickly.

18:30.476 --> 18:33.878
<i>This video continued to
show us a direction of travel</i>

522 Washington Avenue footage,</i>

18:46.959 --> 18:50.495

[Victor]<i> We have to</i>

18:53.899 --> 18:55.500
<i>We have to get them in
and talk to them.</i>

18:55.601 --> 18:57.335
<i>We have to get their stories.</i>

18:57.436 --> 19:02.173
We're becoming more of the belief
that they were involved with this crime.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.247
[melancholy music playing]

19:09.348 --> 19:11.048
[Jim] <i>We spoke with the doctor.</i>

19:11.150 --> 19:13.751
<i>And they told us he's...
he's... He's brain dead.</i>

19:13.852 --> 19:16.020
He's paralyzed
from the neck down.

19:16.121 --> 19:20.424
That he's never, ever
gonna regain consciousness.

<i>in utter desperation.</i>

19:25.364 --> 19:28.499
I was crying very hard

19:28.634 --> 19:31.836
and hoping. I would whisper,

19:31.937 --> 19:34.105
"Please wake up, Rick, come on."

19:35.908 --> 19:39.744
You'd see his foot move and you'd
be like, oh, wow. Okay, here it is.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.647
He's gonna get up.
You know, there's always hope.

19:42.748 --> 19:46.284
There's always hope, but, as
time went on, you realize that...

19:47.886 --> 19:49.086
there is no hope.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.657
[stuttering]<i> You wanna</i>
<i>do everything possible...</i>

19:52.758 --> 19:56.227
<i>but after speaking
with so many medical people...</i>

<i>...the decision was...</i>

20:01.333 --> 20:02.366
[stutters]

20:03.502 --> 20:05.970
He can't live like this.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.906
be in a bed
for the rest of his life.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.576
Just not
regaining consciousness.

20:17.783 --> 20:21.986
It was the most difficult
decision that Lisa and I had...

20:22.087 --> 20:24.322
have ever made
in our lives that...

20:26.525 --> 20:28.826
<i>It was just...</i>

20:28.927 --> 20:32.730
<i>It was terrible. It was...
It was horrible.</i>

20:32.831 --> 20:36.400
The only thing that kinda
helped us along with it

20:36.501 --> 20:37.535
was...

20:38.503 --> 20:40.371
Rick was an organ donor.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.575
And, you know,
my wife and I sat down,

20:44.676 --> 20:46.711
<i>you know, trying to
figure out the decision.</i>

20:46.812 --> 20:49.647
<i>We came
to the realization that...</i>

20:49.748 --> 20:52.583
<i>you know, part of him
can live through other people.</i>

20:53.652 --> 20:55.586
[Lisa]<i> I told my husband</i>

20:55.687 --> 20:59.523
we will not let this tragedy

20:59.625 --> 21:02.994
be a negative, that we have to
turn it into something positive,

21:03.095 --> 21:07.164
and basically,
that's what he wanted to do,

21:08.033 --> 21:09.500
<i>was to help.</i>

21:11.570 --> 21:13.404
<i>That's how we get strength.</i>

<i>To know that...</i>

21:16.208 --> 21:19.210
he did good.

Thank you.

21:39.164 --> 21:40.798
He didn't make it.

21:40.899 --> 21:44.969
In any homicide, the end of life
is traumatic for the loved ones.

21:45.070 --> 21:49.073
The families, the friends.
But it's traumatic for us, too.

21:49.174 --> 21:52.143
There are family members
that are hurting,

21:52.244 --> 21:54.645
that are looking for answers,

21:54.746 --> 21:58.482
and it's our job to give a
sense of closure for the family.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.486
We take the next logical step

22:02.587 --> 22:05.456

for video locations

<i>to get these two individuals from
where they started to where they finished.</i>

22:16.201 --> 22:20.738
The ultimate goal is to get
them as close to their ending point

22:20.839 --> 22:22.173
as we possibly can.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.941
<i>We want to make sure
that there's no one else</i>

There's one. Where's the other?

23:16.528 --> 23:21.165
[Victor]<i> These are the same individuals
we saw at WAMC traveling westbound.</i>

23:21.266 --> 23:26.804
They cut through the parking lot on the
east side of the McDonald's restaurant.

23:26.905 --> 23:31.175
<i>That is a thoroughfare into an
area of the city called Arbor Hill.</i>

23:34.546 --> 23:38.682
<i>We continued our video pursuit
into various locations.</i>

<i>We're looking
for a recognition view,</i>

<i>we're looking for
a street-level camera</i>

23:43.655 --> 23:46.690
eye-level, that is three feet
away from somebody

23:46.792 --> 23:49.193
where you can say,
"Dah, that's who it is."

23:50.495 --> 23:51.862
[Victor] Anything yet?

23:55.534 --> 23:59.069
The last place we see these
two individuals on bicycles

23:59.171 --> 24:02.106
is in the parking lot
of McDonald's

24:02.207 --> 24:04.575
and then they disappeared.

24:04.676 --> 24:08.012
<i>There's a level
of disappointment.</i>

24:08.113 --> 24:11.148
<i>We cast this huge net, and
we dragged in all this video</i>

24:11.249 --> 24:14.285

[Victor]<i> I went to a restaurant

if I could view the video for that night.</i>

24:56.294 --> 24:58.696
<i>He granted me access
to the camera system.</i>

25:06.238 --> 25:09.373
<i>I brought the video system
to the time period</i>

25:09.474 --> 25:13.644

video little quicker than I normally would.

25:16.014 --> 25:16.947
Oh!

25:17.449 --> 25:18.649
Incredible!

25:48.280 --> 25:49.580
Whoa.

25:49.681 --> 25:53.484
<i>I captured an image of an
individual wearing a grey hoodie</i>

<i>riding a bicycle away

25:59.658 --> 26:02.092
<i>I'm thinking to myself,</i>

<i>I don't see any

a second video camera</i>

<i>It's an exciting moment where I
thought, "Boy, this could be our guy."</i>

We were quite possibly looking
into the eyes of the killer.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.441
<i>Everyone knew him.</i>

28:30.542 --> 28:35.479
Not any person that he's ever met
has had a bad thing to say about him.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.214
And...

28:37.315 --> 28:41.218
A community of thousands
was affected by this loss.

28:41.319 --> 28:42.352
It was huge.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.961
[narrator]<i> Weeks pass</i>
<i>with no developments.</i>

28:51.062 --> 28:53.263
The investigation
started to stall out.

28:53.364 --> 28:57.034
<i>We didn't have any more
footage to really give us any insight,</i>

28:57.135 --> 29:02.439
<i>so, while people were still
working countless hours on it,</i>

29:02.540 --> 29:04.041
it became more fishing,
at this point,

29:04.142 --> 29:06.176
trying to find anybody
who may have information.

29:08.446 --> 29:12.516
At that point, we conducted
any interview that we could

29:12.617 --> 29:14.051
with anyone,

29:14.152 --> 29:16.854
whether it was someone that had
been arrested for an unrelated crime,

29:16.955 --> 29:18.989
<i>or someone that was
coming forward</i>

29:19.090 --> 29:21.925
saying that they had information
about the Bailey homicide.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.894
No, doesn't ring a bell.

29:23.995 --> 29:27.097
We received a tip of an
individual named De Von Callicutt

29:27.198 --> 29:28.999
who may have been involved
in the crime.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.367
Okay, thanks.

29:30.468 --> 29:31.735
<i>That happens a lot.</i>

29:31.836 --> 29:34.905
<i>A lot of names are thrown out
during investigations.</i>

29:35.006 --> 29:39.309
Often times they lead to nothing,
but you have to follow those leads.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.480
Callicutt, got it.

29:47.852 --> 29:50.521
[Jason]<i> About a month</i>
<i>after the Bailey homicide,</i>

29:50.622 --> 29:53.724
De Von Callicutt was arrested
for possession of a firearm,

29:53.825 --> 29:56.360
and he was brought down
to the police station.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.230
So, we're thinking, "Okay, this
gun could be our murder weapon."

30:00.331 --> 30:02.833
<i>So, now, it starts to get
a little more interesting.</i>

30:06.304 --> 30:09.406
<i>De Von Callicutt indicated
that he was not involved.</i>

30:10.275 --> 30:12.176
<i>He was willing to take
a polygraph.</i>

30:17.916 --> 30:19.616
You like riding bikes, De Von?

30:19.717 --> 30:21.218
Yeah.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.420
You like shooting guns, De Von?

30:24.656 --> 30:27.057
The result of
that examination was...

30:27.158 --> 30:28.992
No, man, it wasn't me.

30:31.629 --> 30:33.497
[Victor]<i> He passed it.</i>

30:33.598 --> 30:36.900
[Dave]<i> The answers that he
gave were deemed truthful.</i>

30:38.903 --> 30:41.605
So, it felt like we hit
another wall.

30:41.706 --> 30:46.610
The De Von Callicutt angle
wasn't what we were looking for.

30:46.711 --> 30:50.347
A lot of us in the investigative
side were thinking,

30:50.448 --> 30:55.819
"This could be a long time if
we could ever solve this case."

30:55.920 --> 30:58.088
[Dave]<i> There are plenty of
crimes that are never solved.</i>

30:58.189 --> 31:01.992
<i>The further away you get from
the date and time of the homicide,</i>

31:02.093 --> 31:03.660
<i>you start to wonder</i>

31:03.761 --> 31:07.731
if this is going to become one of
those cases that just goes in that pile.

31:11.803 --> 31:15.772
[narrator]<i> Investigators tap into all
their street contacts for any leads.</i>

31:15.874 --> 31:17.741
[telephone ringing]

31:17.842 --> 31:20.444
Vogel. Yeah, put him through.

31:20.545 --> 31:24.147
[Jason]<i> We're lucky enough to
have an individual come forward.</i>

31:27.285 --> 31:29.553
<i>This individual was able
to tell us</i>

31:29.654 --> 31:33.490
<i>that he was in the area of
McDonald's on Central Avenue</i>

31:33.591 --> 31:36.994
<i>on the day of the Richard
Bailey homicide,</i>

31:37.095 --> 31:40.597
<i>and that he recalls
hearing police sirens.</i>

31:40.698 --> 31:44.401
<i>And then he remembers
next seeing two people</i>

31:44.502 --> 31:46.803
<i>making a left hand turn
on Central Avenue</i>

31:46.905 --> 31:48.772
<i>going west bound
from Quail Street.</i>

31:48.873 --> 31:51.675
<i>And once these individuals
rode past him,</i>

31:51.743 --> 31:54.144
he identified them as being

31:54.245 --> 31:56.146
King Modest
and Ricardo Caldwell.

31:57.315 --> 31:58.849
This was a big moment
in the investigation

31:58.950 --> 32:02.319
because now we had a name that
we could put to these two individuals.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.721
<i>What was really important about
it was that it was so believable</i>

32:04.822 --> 32:06.890
<i>because he didn't know
what footage we had.</i>

32:06.991 --> 32:08.492
<i>He just told us the story.</i>

32:08.593 --> 32:10.193
<i>And then we could go back
and look</i>

32:10.295 --> 32:13.263
<i>and see that the footage
we had corroborated his story.</i>

32:19.704 --> 32:23.407
[Jason]<i> Now that we've identified
the two individuals on the bike,</i>

32:25.043 --> 32:29.579
<i>our next steps were to try
and obtain any evidence,</i>

32:29.681 --> 32:31.949
<i>that would tie
these two individuals</i>

32:32.050 --> 32:33.517
to the Bailey homicide.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.758
<i>We had someone step forward
that told us they could</i>

32:41.859 --> 32:45.462
have a conversation
with King Modest.

32:45.563 --> 32:47.898
[Dave] <i>This informant was
looking at quite a bit of time</i>

32:47.999 --> 32:50.400
<i>and said that if King Modest
was involved in this</i>

32:50.501 --> 32:51.935
<i>he could get him
to talk about it.</i>

32:54.005 --> 32:55.872
<i>The next step
was somewhat unprecedented.</i>

32:55.974 --> 32:57.841
We actually sprung him
from jail.

32:57.942 --> 33:01.211
[Victor]<i> The individual was provided
with some recording equipment.</i>

33:02.113 --> 33:05.282
<i>And he went off
about his business</i>

33:05.383 --> 33:09.119
in an attempt to try and get
whatever information he could.

33:17.128 --> 33:18.028
Mm-hmm.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.263
Yeah.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.532
[Jim]<i> They would</i>
<i>contact us all the time</i>

33:22.633 --> 33:23.800
and let us know what's going on

33:23.901 --> 33:25.969
and they would just
say to us, you know,

33:26.070 --> 33:28.972
"Be patient, we're gonna
get you where you wanna be."

33:29.707 --> 33:30.741
<i>Just give us time...</i>

33:30.842 --> 33:31.775
Okay.

33:31.876 --> 33:33.377
<i>...we're gonna get
justice for Rick.</i>

33:33.478 --> 33:34.778
<i>Just be patient.</i>

33:44.856 --> 33:47.391
[narrator]<i> The informant</i>
<i>returns to Albany PD.</i>

33:49.761 --> 33:52.829
[Victor]<i> We were told that
King Modest was on this audio.</i>

33:52.930 --> 33:54.464
We were really
excited about this

33:54.565 --> 33:56.366
<i>because for the first time
we were gonna hear,</i>

33:56.467 --> 33:58.268
<i>from the mouth of somebody
that was involved in this,</i>

33:58.369 --> 33:59.636
<i>exactly what happened
that night.</i>

33:59.737 --> 34:01.705
<i>And when we heard
that recording...</i>

34:03.307 --> 34:04.241
We couldn't believe it.

34:06.511 --> 34:07.744

34:17.889 --> 34:19.122
[King Modest

[Victor]<i> Instantly we could hear
two individuals speaking on the audio.</i>

34:27.832 --> 34:30.734
We heard who we believe
to be King Modest,

34:30.835 --> 34:33.603
describing what had taken place.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.305

<i>King Modest describing</i>

34:56.727 --> 35:02.365
what his role along with Ricardo
Caldwell's role was during this shooting.

35:03.634 --> 35:05.702
<i>He and Caldwell
were the lookouts.</i>

35:05.803 --> 35:08.238
And that someone
by the street name of Cut,

35:08.339 --> 35:11.374
was the person that went up
to the college kid.

35:12.376 --> 35:14.311
And ended up shooting him.

35:14.412 --> 35:15.579

35:20.151 --> 35:21.718
[King Modest
speaking over recorder]

35:40.938 --> 35:44.207
King Modest told his friend,
on the recording

35:44.308 --> 35:45.675
that, yes, he was there

35:45.776 --> 35:47.711
and yes, Ricardo Caldwell

35:47.812 --> 35:49.412
But it was Cut, who had the gun.

were in separate rooms but they
essentially told the same story.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.525
<i>And that was,
the three of them were out</i>

36:35.626 --> 36:37.894
<i>committing robberies that night.</i>

36:37.995 --> 36:40.497
<i>And it was a person

36:40.598 --> 36:44.267
who put the gun to Rick's head
and murdered him.

36:45.469 --> 36:47.337
So what's Cut's real name?

36:47.438 --> 36:49.606
- De Von Callicutt.
- De Von Callicutt.

36:54.278 --> 36:55.545
[Jason] <i>It was shocking to me,</i>

36:55.646 --> 36:57.514
that they were implicating
De Von Callicutt.

36:57.615 --> 37:01.184
<i>Because we knew that De Von
Callicutt had passed a polygraph test.</i>

37:02.420 --> 37:04.187
[narrator]<i> It's enough</i>
<i>to gain a search warrant</i>

37:04.288 --> 37:07.057
<i>for De Von Callicutt's
cell phone records.</i>

37:07.158 --> 37:08.925

37:14.665 --> 37:17.200

37:17.301 --> 37:20.136
<i>It surprises me that someone
was able to pass the polygraph.</i>

37:20.238 --> 37:24.441
It takes a special type
of person to be able to lie

lost a bunch of money,

39:07.678 --> 39:12.282
It was De Von Callicutt's idea
to go get some free money.

<i>Which is,
"Let's go rob some people."</i>

39:16.821 --> 39:19.389
<i>They got on their bikes and
they were looking for victims.</i>

39:19.490 --> 39:21.725
They came upon Richard Bailey

[Dave]<i> De Von Callicutt</i>

Without it, I think this would
be a cold case.

<i>I don't believe it ever would have

41:59.517 --> 42:04.120
<i>A football tournament, where we
raise money for different charities.</i>

42:04.188 --> 42:08.191
We've actually had,
at this point, 13 fundraisers.

42:09.393 --> 42:12.362
<i>Each year has been
bigger than the one before.</i>

42:12.463 --> 42:15.732
<i>He was just a great person
throughout his life.</i>

42:15.833 --> 42:18.701
And that's why we've always
had such successful turnout.

42:21.739 --> 42:25.074
It's just amazing to show
what kind of person he was.

42:25.175 --> 42:29.445
That all these people still look
forward to coming to this every year.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.281
<i>And celebrating
the life of Rick.</i>

42:32.216 --> 42:33.216
He would be proud.
