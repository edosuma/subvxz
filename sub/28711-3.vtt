00:19.062 --> 00:20.716
[Matt]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:20.803 --> 00:22.500
Do you think
Alec's boat blowing up
was an accident?

00:22.587 --> 00:23.414
Hello?

00:24.415 --> 00:26.591
I don't like the timing.

00:26.678 --> 00:29.377
[Abby]  He was tracking
the progress of the disease.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.292
And he thought that
he was onto something.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.163
Dr. Jason Woodrue.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.513
You told me your accelerant
would make things grow faster.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.515
The accelerant works.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.430
[Avery] But we've also got
a hospital full up
with people

00:39.517 --> 00:41.954
with some kind
of crazy green flu.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.130
I'm gonna look into it.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.392
No, you're gonna fix it.

00:44.479 --> 00:45.654
[Matt] Abby, you circled round.

00:45.741 --> 00:46.698
Been through this area twice.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.401
Come on, Landreaux,
I wanna make this
as quick and as painless--

00:59.842 --> 01:01.061
You don't wanna run from me.

01:02.279 --> 01:03.628
-[growls]
-[grunts]

01:05.456 --> 01:07.023
What in the fuck are you?

01:07.110 --> 01:07.937
[roaring]

01:08.720 --> 01:09.895
[screams]

01:16.902 --> 01:18.643
[footsteps crunching]

01:43.059 --> 01:44.278
What happened to your shoes?

01:45.366 --> 01:46.149
Hmm?

01:48.499 --> 01:49.283
Oh.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.503
That's weird.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.245
Guess I, uh, lost them
somewhere.

01:55.332 --> 01:58.596
What's a pretty city boy
like you doing out here
anyway?

01:58.683 --> 02:00.642
Right. Um, no, I was, um...

02:04.254 --> 02:07.083
uh, doing research
on the swamp and then, um...

02:13.481 --> 02:15.831
There was a fire.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.615
You don't even remember me,
do you?

02:20.270 --> 02:21.097
[screams]

02:24.056 --> 02:25.232
Kind of.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.885
That's right.

02:26.972 --> 02:29.149
I'm that son of a bitch
you murdered.

02:30.324 --> 02:33.283
I am so, so sorry.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.764
-[screams]
You're fucking sorry?
-[grunts]

02:37.418 --> 02:38.767
You're dead!

02:38.854 --> 02:40.421
-Stop!
-Dead!

02:40.508 --> 02:42.814
[screams] Don't! Stop!

02:42.901 --> 02:46.035
I'm coming back for you,
you hear me?

02:47.602 --> 02:48.951
[voice echoes]

02:55.305 --> 02:56.132
[growls]

03:09.537 --> 03:12.104
[roars]

03:41.264 --> 03:43.223
[theme music playing]

04:57.427 --> 04:59.342
[Liz] I don't get it, Abby.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.214
You brought back
the little girl, right?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.564
Shouldn't you be doing
a victory lap?

05:07.524 --> 05:09.352
I found something else, Liz.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.788
Someone else.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.314
Okay?

05:14.401 --> 05:17.882
I think Susie Coyle was drawn
into the swamp by a man.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.671
I know this sounds insane,

05:23.758 --> 05:26.891
but there is a human being
out there.

05:26.978 --> 05:31.069
His entire body was covered
in plants... and vines.

05:34.725 --> 05:38.468
And this Susie went to
see him because... why?

05:38.555 --> 05:41.428
She said she was called
into the swamp to help him.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.299
That he was sick
and he needed her.

05:45.214 --> 05:49.218
And... And she told me that
this person's name...

05:50.741 --> 05:51.916
was Alec.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.140
[chuckles in disbelief]

05:58.227 --> 05:59.446
Fuck me.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.360
Yeah.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.712
So what did you do?

06:04.799 --> 06:07.236
I didn't know what
I was supposed to do.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.585
It was a bloodbath
out there,

06:08.672 --> 06:09.760
Susie was going
into shock.

06:09.847 --> 06:10.674
I...

06:13.024 --> 06:13.851
ran.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.551
I fucking ran.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.034
Have you told anyone else
about this?

06:25.210 --> 06:26.690
I don't know if I should.

06:27.865 --> 06:28.997
[cell phone vibrating]

06:33.871 --> 06:35.046
I don't believe this.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.701
What?

06:37.788 --> 06:39.921
I have to go to the hospital.
Can we talk later?

06:40.008 --> 06:41.270
Yeah, sure.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.148
Hey.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.542
Dr. Troost and the new CDC team
arrived this morning.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.239
I take it you didn't know.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.937
Where is he?

06:56.024 --> 06:56.807
[Eli] Oh, Abby.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.898
-[Abby] What's going on, Eli?
-[sighs]

07:00.985 --> 07:03.161
We've been keeping an eye
on things from Atlanta,

07:03.248 --> 07:04.946
we felt it was time
for a fresh approach.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.904
Yeah, it's...
It's an unusual case.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.341
Nonetheless,
we need to change tact.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.256
So I'm starting
a new drug regimen.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.433
High dose IV Vancomycin
and meropenem.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.130
Are you serious?

07:15.217 --> 07:16.827
No, I already have them
maxed out on antibiotics--

07:16.914 --> 07:18.742
Dr. Arcane, I'm not
looking for a debate--

07:18.829 --> 07:20.004
[cell phone vibrating]

07:20.091 --> 07:20.918
Excuse me.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.709
Why send a supervisor
all the way from Atlanta?

07:28.796 --> 07:30.624
There's another hotshot
in the house.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.321
You've heard
of Dr. Jason Woodrue?

07:33.235 --> 07:35.237
Yes, the bio-geneticist?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.762
He's... He's certainly not CDC.

07:38.849 --> 07:41.069
Woodrue's in the morgue
right now getting up to speed,

07:41.156 --> 07:42.940
re-examining the body
of Eddie Coyle.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.421
Apparently, Avery Sunderland
is footing his bill.

07:47.075 --> 07:47.902
Avery...

07:50.208 --> 07:53.647
[mechanical whirring]

07:58.478 --> 07:59.827
Dr. Woodrue.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.742
-[saw stops]
-[classical music playing]

08:11.708 --> 08:12.927
Take a close look.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.018
What do you see?

08:21.196 --> 08:23.764
Well, the...

08:23.851 --> 08:26.723
renal medulla is
severely constricted
by a foreign matter.

08:28.246 --> 08:31.511
Ureteric bud appears
bloated, about to burst.

08:32.990 --> 08:33.817
Go on.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.474
[music stops]

08:38.561 --> 08:40.650
Is this... a test?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.610
[sighs]

08:43.697 --> 08:45.612
I prefer to consult with people

08:45.699 --> 08:48.223
who have some vague
understanding
of the subject matter.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.358
I understand you are supplied
to us by Avery Sunderland.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.448
You two old friends?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.537
[scoffs] Please.

08:59.930 --> 09:05.719
The invading organism has
adapted to its prey with
great specificity.

09:05.806 --> 09:08.025
It's incredible, it's...

09:08.112 --> 09:10.158
part parasite,
part carnivore.

09:12.203 --> 09:15.163
Yet entirely
plant-based material.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.947
-Mmm.
-Big picture.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.253
What else do you see?

09:24.476 --> 09:25.521
[Abby] What do I see?

09:27.262 --> 09:29.264
I see a man
named Eddie Coyle,

09:30.874 --> 09:33.007
a human being that lived,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.967
was raising a little girl,
then died,

09:37.054 --> 09:40.449
and was tortured to death
by an awful disease.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.538
[chuckles]

09:42.625 --> 09:44.932
I'm sorry.
Did I say something funny?

09:45.019 --> 09:46.194
No, it's just your...

09:47.717 --> 09:50.111
Your view is quite limiting.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.678
-Miss?
-Dr. Arcane.

09:51.765 --> 09:52.592
Abby Arcane.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.118
Nature is brutal.

09:57.205 --> 10:01.513
Life devours life.
It's a battle to the death.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.604
To bring emotion to bear
taints the scientific vision.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.390
Well, I'm sorry if that
makes me biased,

10:08.477 --> 10:12.133
but I'm on the side
of humans in this battle.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.832
All life is a zero-sum game,
Dr. Arcane.

10:15.919 --> 10:18.705
And today the score
is plants, one,

10:18.792 --> 10:19.749
humans, zero.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.639
Hello, Gordon.
Love the suit.
Brooks Brothers?

10:39.726 --> 10:42.032
No, wait. Now that I see it
up close, I'm thinking...

10:42.119 --> 10:43.686
-Men's Wearhouse?
-Told you.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.775
-Got nothing to say.
-It's a small town, Gordon.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.864
You can block my calls,
delete my emails,

10:47.951 --> 10:49.344
unfriend me
if it makes you feel better,

10:49.431 --> 10:50.824
but sooner or later,
you're gonna talk to me.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.303
I don't know what
you think you've got,

10:52.390 --> 10:54.305
but it's complete
and utter bullshit.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.395
Then why do you act
so damn scared every time
I come around?

10:57.482 --> 11:00.834
Look, I know you've been
making off-the-books loans
to Avery Sunderland.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.618
It's him I want.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.273
Talk to me.
I'll keep your name
out of the paper.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.190
But you know,
when you just
ignore me like this,

11:09.277 --> 11:10.670
it kind of hurts my feelings.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.209
-[Matt] Just give me a sec.
-[officer] Sure. No problem.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.821
Finally.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.518
Trying to get you
on the radio.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.831
We recovered
Vern Robitelle's body.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.790
The coroner said he had
his throat ripped out.

11:43.877 --> 11:47.402
Deputy Guidry fished
a boat hook out
of the water nearby.

11:47.489 --> 11:48.664
It's probably
the murder weapon.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.537
That's two dead bodies.
What the hell happened here?

11:52.624 --> 11:55.105
Whatever it was,
you shouldn't have
acted on your own.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.716
-There was a little girl
missing--
-It doesn't matter.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.195
It was reckless.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.720
You follow protocol,
you wait for backup.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.765
And I can't help thinking
that if Abby Arcane

12:02.852 --> 12:04.506
-hadn't been involved,
then you probably would have.
-[sighs]

12:09.293 --> 12:10.120
[sighs]

12:12.906 --> 12:14.472
So where are we at
in the Alec Holland front?

12:20.435 --> 12:24.787
There's no reason
to believe that it wasn't
just stupid bad luck,

12:24.874 --> 12:27.311
I mean, a spark gets into
one of those old outboards,
[snaps fingers]

12:27.398 --> 12:29.009
boom, the whole thing
goes up, right?

12:29.096 --> 12:31.359
Mmm-hmm.

12:31.446 --> 12:34.666
Then I'll talk to Avery later
in case there's anything else
he can add.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.581
If nothing pops up
by tomorrow,

12:36.668 --> 12:38.453
then we close it out
as accidental.

12:43.110 --> 12:46.200
You know, Ma,
we found Susie Coyle.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.506
We found her and
brought her back safe.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.291
If Abby Arcane
hadn't been involved,

12:50.378 --> 12:52.423
this story might not
have a happy ending.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.182
Her vitals look good.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.270
Blood pressure is down.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.796
Has she been awake at all?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.493
Not since I came in.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.190
Harlan was looking after
her overnight.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.197
[Abby] Hey.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.851
Guess you heard about
Eli's hostile takeover.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.114
Guy's a dick.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.422
Harlan, are you asleep
on the job?

13:36.467 --> 13:38.556
Sorry, Abby.

13:38.643 --> 13:41.255
I know caregivers
aren't supposed to get sick
on your watch but...

13:42.952 --> 13:44.693
You know how it is.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.303
-Harlan.
-[coughing]

13:47.609 --> 13:48.915
Harlan?

13:49.002 --> 13:49.829
Harlan!

13:53.267 --> 13:55.573
Code blue! Crash cart!

13:55.660 --> 13:57.184
On your side, Harlan.
Gotta clear your airway.
On your side. On your side.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.403
Five cc's epinephrine,
two liters O2,

13:59.490 --> 14:01.144
initiate Valium
Dilantin protocol.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.929
Dr. Arcane, your mask!

14:03.016 --> 14:05.061
[Harlan choking]

14:05.148 --> 14:06.628
[Eli] Okay, I need
a gurney here now!

14:09.370 --> 14:10.762
[Abby] It's okay, Harlan.
It's okay.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.503
Clear his airway.

14:12.590 --> 14:15.942
[Eli] Go! On three.
One, two, three!

14:16.029 --> 14:18.814
-Okay, put him on his side.
-[Abby] Make sure you clear
his airway.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.338
The swelling can get
into his throat and
constrict his throat.

14:21.425 --> 14:22.949
-Please make sure you--
-Dr. Cane, I've got this.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.301
Fuck!

14:28.476 --> 14:30.043
[Liz]  Abby, what's wrong?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.175
It's Harlan.
He's come down
with the disease.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.307
Shit.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.613
To hell with
Avery's secrecy,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.354
I need to get into Holland's
lab and figure out what
he was working on.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.356
With any luck,
it'll point me towards a cure.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.271
[Liz] Alec had to be
on to something.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.925
It's a Hail Mary,
but it's all I've got.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.189
Be careful.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.060
Yeah.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.584
[motor starts]

14:57.070 --> 14:58.114
You got eyes on her?

14:58.201 --> 15:00.247
Traveling the north 40.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.944
Do me a favor.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.815
If you ever get
to Skeeter Cove,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.426
keep your eyes out
for any debris
from Holland's boat.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.995
-Humor me.
-[chuckles]

15:09.082 --> 15:10.170
Don't I always?

15:29.711 --> 15:31.321
[woman on phone]
So when the hell
are you coming home?

15:31.408 --> 15:32.801
Tonight? Tomorrow?

15:32.888 --> 15:34.194
[man]
As soon as I get a kill.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.109
Well,
I ain't waitin' forever.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.764
[distant snorting, squealing]

15:39.851 --> 15:40.678
I gotta go.

15:43.159 --> 15:43.943
What the hell?

16:02.831 --> 16:04.267
-[loud squealing]
-[thud]

16:24.244 --> 16:25.593
[gagging]

16:30.380 --> 16:32.861
[Jason] I wish
you could've seen it,
Caroline.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.820
The rate of mutation
is just astounding.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.345
It sounds almost
as if the genes are
being swapped

16:38.432 --> 16:41.696
between cells outside
of sexual reproduction.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.351
[Jason] Which makes
genetic advances
thousands of times more rapid

16:44.438 --> 16:46.353
than we ever dreamt possible,

16:46.440 --> 16:50.139
but it's not just because
of the accelerant.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.446
There's something...

16:52.533 --> 16:54.926
There's something specific
about the mutagenic properties
of this place.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.713
It's nice to see
that fire in your eye.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.063
That passion,
thirst for knowledge.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.982
I know an extended visit
to Marais, Louisiana,

17:07.069 --> 17:10.116
was not high
on your bucket list but...

17:10.203 --> 17:11.030
Jason.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.815
Have you seen my pills?

17:17.906 --> 17:20.126
My pills. I thought
I set them on the counter.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.089
That's 'cause
you already took them.

17:30.962 --> 17:31.789
See?

17:32.660 --> 17:33.443
There you go.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.577
They're all gone.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.535
[Caroline] I'm sorry.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.624
[Jason] We knew there was gonna
be episodes like this, right?

17:40.711 --> 17:43.192
So, it's gonna be okay.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.891
I'm slowly losing my mind.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.851
And we both know it.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.419
Listen to me, sweetheart.

17:52.506 --> 17:56.031
I refuse to accept that
your condition is incurable.

17:56.118 --> 18:00.079
Because I refuse to accept
my life without you.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.342
Yeah.

18:05.823 --> 18:06.868
Jason...

18:10.132 --> 18:11.829
What if I forget you?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.181
No.

18:16.834 --> 18:17.661
No.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.927
[Avery] Listen, I know
it's been very stressful

18:23.014 --> 18:26.583
with Abby being in here
and all, dredging up
these... Well, the memories.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.977
At least you'll be
going soon.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.240
I just wanna see you back
to your old self is all.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.071
The thing is, Avery...

18:36.158 --> 18:39.727
I am back to my old self.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.645
I've just been faking it
for the last 14 years,

18:44.732 --> 18:46.168
and that's the problem.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.042
I'm faking it
as hard as I can,

18:51.956 --> 18:54.045
because if I don't,

18:54.133 --> 18:57.397
I just sink back
to my old self.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.706
-[woman] Mr. Sunderland?
-Yeah?

19:02.793 --> 19:04.317
Gordon Haas is here?

19:05.274 --> 19:06.406
[Avery] Gordon Haas?

19:06.493 --> 19:07.885
What the hell
is he doing here?

19:07.972 --> 19:09.409
You tell him to call me
in the morning.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.932
[woman] Yes, I tried that, sir.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.066
Gordon...

19:16.416 --> 19:17.199
What the hell?

19:20.463 --> 19:21.682
Gordon, I'm in the middle
of dinner.

19:21.769 --> 19:22.552
It couldn't wait.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.556
The bank's been asking
questions.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.820
You know my situation.
I got enough investors
on the hook.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.910
As soon as they see
the results of
my swamp study--

19:32.997 --> 19:34.390
[Gordon] You're not hearing me.
I'm done.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.523
I'm out.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.306
I don't know
how you convinced me
to do this in the first place.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.352
[Avery] Mmm-hmm.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.136
Well, maybe it was 'cause
of kickback after kickback,

19:41.223 --> 19:42.964
you greedy little bastard.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.705
If the bank finds out

19:44.792 --> 19:46.097
I'm transferring funds
for personal loans for you,

19:46.185 --> 19:47.186
I could go to prison.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.015
Well, that's your job.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.408
So make sure
that doesn't happen.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.106
Hmm?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.934
So you just man up.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.459
Yeah. Fix it.

19:59.546 --> 20:03.376
And don't you...
Don't you come to my house
uninvited again.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.378
[Gordon] No. Avery. No more.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.555
I need it all back.
Repaid in full, or...

20:08.642 --> 20:10.774
this town's gonna be awfully
surprised when they find out

20:10.861 --> 20:13.081
the mighty Avery Sunderland
is actually in debt
up to his eyeballs.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.302
You have 24 hours.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.742
[door opens]

20:23.744 --> 20:24.527
[door closes]

20:34.798 --> 20:36.844
[thunder rumbling]

21:35.206 --> 21:36.643
[insects chittering]

21:53.964 --> 21:54.791
[insects buzzing]

22:02.669 --> 22:04.975
[Lucilia] So you
don't know of anyone

22:05.062 --> 22:07.413
who would want to
hurt Alec Holland?

22:07.500 --> 22:08.892
[Avery] Not a soul.

22:08.979 --> 22:12.243
Well, maybe he had trouble
with some locals,

22:12.331 --> 22:13.419
being an outsider and all?

22:13.506 --> 22:14.855
I hardly knew the man.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.510
I needed a scientist
for my project.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.163
And he was available.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.651
-Something funny?
-No.

22:28.738 --> 22:32.002
I've just never seen
your professional side
up close before.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.178
Lucilia Cable, crime fighter.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.399
[Lucilia] Hmm.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.402
I know it is a terrible thing
what happened to him,

22:40.489 --> 22:42.578
but if you need to know,

22:42.665 --> 22:45.668
Alec Holland hadn't
been at the forefront
of my worries lately.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.453
No?

22:47.540 --> 22:51.413
Maria's taken to sleeping
in Shawna's room again.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.285
Well,

22:54.373 --> 22:56.157
she's always been complicated.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.118
But you knew that
when you married her.

23:03.860 --> 23:07.690
Abby Arcane's return has
brought it all back to her.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.998
You know,

23:11.085 --> 23:12.608
it seems like
in the past few months,

23:12.695 --> 23:15.394
this entire town's
been slipping down

23:15.481 --> 23:19.963
some deep, dark hole.

23:20.050 --> 23:23.184
I just know that
more people have died
in the last five days

23:23.271 --> 23:24.881
than in the previous
five years.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.536
Folks are scared.

23:27.623 --> 23:28.929
I don't blame 'em.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.026
You look good,

23:39.113 --> 23:39.983
Lucilia.

23:40.680 --> 23:44.379
[laughs]

23:44.466 --> 23:46.555
Avery...

23:46.642 --> 23:49.776
I always look good
when Maria's cutting you off.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.655
I know you.

23:59.742 --> 24:02.266
-You think so?
-I know so.

24:02.353 --> 24:05.879
I know you.
I remember you.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.837
I remember you.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.709
And I miss you.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.451
[door opens]

24:12.538 --> 24:14.322
-Wait. Is she home?
-No, no, no.

24:14.409 --> 24:17.804
She never comes
downstairs after dinner.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.327
-No.
-Wait a minute.

24:19.414 --> 24:20.850
No. No.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.635
I...

24:22.722 --> 24:26.029
Well, have I satisfied you
on the Alec Holland question?

24:26.987 --> 24:28.205
I'll let you know.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.231
[Shawna in distorted voice]
Hi, Mommy.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.714
Shawna, my love.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.543
Do you really think
Daddy stayed faithful
to you all these years?

25:04.154 --> 25:05.721
Why would you say
something like that?

25:05.808 --> 25:08.115
Does he seem like
the kind of man

25:08.202 --> 25:10.465
who could stay faithful
to anyone, really?

25:13.163 --> 25:15.339
Don't say things like that
about your father.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.341
Does he even still love you?

25:17.428 --> 25:19.735
Shawna,
what you're saying
is cruel.

25:19.822 --> 25:23.304
Or maybe,
he keeps you around
for some other reason.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.218
Stop it!

25:38.362 --> 25:39.668
[thunder rumbling]

26:00.559 --> 26:02.256
[Alec]  May I offer you a drink?

26:02.343 --> 26:04.563
I sure as hell could use one.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.565
[Abby]  That's two things
we have in common.

26:11.004 --> 26:11.787
I...

26:13.310 --> 26:14.790
have a confession.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.009
[skittering]

26:23.886 --> 26:25.061
[creaking]

26:37.247 --> 26:38.640
[thunder rumbling]

26:38.727 --> 26:39.685
[insects buzzing]

26:58.747 --> 26:59.705
[loud thud]

27:13.893 --> 27:14.676
[thudding]

27:18.854 --> 27:19.638
[screams]

27:22.292 --> 27:23.990
[insects buzzing loudly]

27:25.339 --> 27:28.037
[Munson growling] Where is he?

27:30.083 --> 27:30.866
[growls]

27:35.479 --> 27:36.829
[growls]

27:45.489 --> 27:47.143
Get the fuck away from me!

27:47.883 --> 27:48.884
[snarls]

28:05.466 --> 28:07.816
Leave her.

28:08.774 --> 28:09.905
[growls]

28:23.005 --> 28:23.789
[grunts]

28:28.881 --> 28:29.795
[yells]

28:32.711 --> 28:33.537
[gasps]

28:43.983 --> 28:45.114
[straining]

29:04.960 --> 29:07.223
I'm that son of a bitch
you murdered.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.137
[screams]

29:15.754 --> 29:16.885
[insects buzzing]

29:18.800 --> 29:20.541
Release him.

29:37.688 --> 29:38.907
[bugs chittering]

29:44.957 --> 29:46.741
You are safe now.

29:53.139 --> 29:55.532
Susie Coyle said
you were...

29:56.359 --> 29:57.752
Alec Holland.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.629
[growls]

30:38.053 --> 30:39.272
Abby...

30:40.055 --> 30:40.969
[gasps]

30:53.199 --> 30:55.201
I saw you that night
in the swamp.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.638
After the explosion.

31:03.644 --> 31:04.993
Do you remember what happened?

31:14.307 --> 31:16.483
I was burning.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.404
What am I?

31:27.320 --> 31:29.452
A good man.

31:29.539 --> 31:32.020
A scientist.
Someone who could help me

31:32.107 --> 31:33.935
find a way to bring
the man I knew back.

31:41.682 --> 31:45.120
I don't understand
this disease and why
it's fighting us.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.560
Not fighting.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.914
Fighting back.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.104
[Abby] What's going on?

32:12.191 --> 32:13.975
It's a shit show.
All of them are tanking.

32:14.062 --> 32:17.283
-Convulsions, spasms.
Two have gone into comas.
-Shit.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.112
Harlan.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.461
[doctor] I mean, we're slamming
this thing as hard as we can.

32:21.548 --> 32:22.549
Strongest antibiotics
known to man.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.854
But it just keeps fighting.

32:23.942 --> 32:24.943
It's not fighting.

32:25.900 --> 32:26.727
It's fighting back.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.164
I need two syringes.

32:29.251 --> 32:30.774
Five cc's azathioprine,

32:30.861 --> 32:33.342
second syringe,
five cc's leflunomide glycol.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.778
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.041
-Right away, Doctor.
-[Abby] Thank you.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.172
Harlan, stay with me.

32:42.134 --> 32:42.961
Thank you.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.488
[Eli] What the hell
is going on here?

32:48.575 --> 32:50.272
You're administering
immunosuppressants?

32:50.359 --> 32:52.274
The antibiotics are
just making things worse.

32:52.361 --> 32:53.928
Their immune systems
are the only thing
keeping them alive.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.234
They're never going to
outgun this.

32:55.321 --> 32:56.931
It is mutating
at lightning speed.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.499
The more we fight it,
the harder it attacks back.

32:59.586 --> 33:02.023
-Get security.
-Harlan, stay with me,
stay with me.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.982
I lose you,
who's going to
keep me honest?

33:06.114 --> 33:07.724
[Eli] Get her outta here!

33:07.811 --> 33:09.639
-[doctor] Look. Look!
-Doctor, the BP is dropping.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.599
-190, 185...
-[EKG beeping slows]

33:12.686 --> 33:15.950
-[nurse] Temp is down to 101.
-Harlan, Harlan, Harlan.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.780
Hey, hey, hey, Harlan.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.042
-Hey.
-[Harlan groans softly]

33:21.129 --> 33:23.001
Hey. Do you know
where you are?

33:23.088 --> 33:23.914
Do you know who I am?

33:26.395 --> 33:27.657
Nicki Minaj.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.966
I'm your biggest fan.

33:32.053 --> 33:32.880
[chuckles]

33:36.275 --> 33:40.453
Five cc's azathioprine,
five cc's leflunomide glycol
for every patient.

33:43.499 --> 33:44.674
[Eli] Do it.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.724
[monitors beeping steadily]

33:52.378 --> 33:53.988
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

33:56.904 --> 33:57.861
How you feeling?

33:58.732 --> 34:00.516
-Better.
-Good.

34:03.606 --> 34:06.000
We're trying a new medicine,
and I think it's working.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.660
