didn't speak for a long time.

17:37.521 --> 17:41.028
And, um, when he finally
reached out to me

17:41.028 --> 17:43.533

I was furious.

17:43.533 --> 17:47.082

because faith or no faith,

17:47.082 --> 17:50.881

17:50.881 --> 17:52.635
So I‐I agreed to meet him,

17:52.635 --> 17:54.639
but only if
we did it at the racetrack.

17:54.639 --> 17:57.143

on horses before,

would hate.

And the thing is, we ended up
having the best day.

18:04.491 --> 18:06.453
And then a few weeks later
when I asked him

18:06.453 --> 18:08.792
where he wanted to go,
he said the track.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.213

he broke the rules.

19:26.363 --> 19:28.869

shattered him every day.

48:02.584 --> 48:07.511
their girlfriend's father
for the first time.

48:07.511 --> 48:09.807
But for me, it was
a hundred times worse...

48:12.437 --> 48:14.274
Because I knew,
without a shadow of a doubt,

48:14.274 --> 48:18.825
that Sarah was the one.

48:20.704 --> 48:24.002
But Hank, he was‐‐
he was so kind to me.

48:26.591 --> 48:30.807
You know, I remember him
putting his hand on my chest,

48:30.807 --> 48:35.525
and he told me...

48:35.525 --> 48:37.988
"I can s"‐‐

48:40.201 --> 48:44.417
"I can see your heart is good."

48:44.417 --> 48:47.090
You see, Hank‐‐
he believed in me

48:47.090 --> 48:49.219
from the very beginning.

48:51.724 --> 48:56.776
And we honor him
by honoring his example.

48:56.776 --> 48:59.447
You see, The Light...

48:59.447 --> 49:02.161
it chose me.

49:02.161 --> 49:05.836
And for those
who disobey my word

49:05.836 --> 49:09.092
turn their backs
on The Light.

49:09.092 --> 49:14.562
But all who decide
to follow me‐‐like Hank‐‐

49:14.562 --> 49:17.108
will find their place
in the Garden.
