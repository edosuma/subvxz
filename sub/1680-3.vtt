00:00.523 --> 00:02.873
Kids I know you think you
have ever heard of a story

00:02.947 --> 00:04.681
<i>from back before I
met your mother,</i>

00:04.748 --> 00:06.414
but there are some stories you tell

00:06.481 --> 00:08.381
<i>and some stories you don't.</i>

00:08.448 --> 00:09.581
(breathless): Oh, my God!

00:09.648 --> 00:11.748
(shaking gibberish) Oh, my God...

00:11.815 --> 00:13.748
Use your words, Ted.

00:13.815 --> 00:16.414
Okay. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.

00:16.481 --> 00:17.181
The belt?

00:17.247 --> 00:18.181
The belt.

00:18.247 --> 00:19.481
But that's impossible

00:19.548 --> 00:20.980
You were up here less
than half an hour ago.

00:21.047 --> 00:22.181
(grunts)

00:22.247 --> 00:23.715
||runts)

00:23.781 --> 00:25.514
(groans) Yes! Advantage... Ericksen.

00:25.581 --> 00:28.548
Don't get cocky. Wimbledon sts a fortnight.

00:28.614 --> 00:29.781
"Fortnight."

00:29.847 --> 00:31.247
British words are so cool.

00:31.314 --> 00:33.047
Plus, did you know lawyers
there get to wear wigs?

00:33.114 --> 00:34.980
I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.

00:35.047 --> 00:36.748
TED: right.

00:37.980 --> 00:39.204
I'm We can't go. Tournament.

00:39.245 --> 00:40.950
What? We agreed.
I suited up...

00:41.040 --> 00:42.220
you take too long to get ready

00:42.550 --> 00:45.300
What are you talking about?

00:45.341 --> 00:45.748
Yeah, which takes an hour and a half

00:45.789 --> 00:47.147
Yeah, which takes an hour and a half

00:47.214 --> 00:49.748
of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.

00:49.815 --> 00:51.214
And then he starts on his hair.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.290
Ace!

00:53.180 --> 00:54.130
Look, are we
going or not?

00:54.140 --> 00:55.440
Just go without us.
We'll be there in five minutes.

00:55.507 --> 00:56.180
Really?

00:56.373 --> 00:57.507
Yes!
Yes!

00:57.572 --> 00:59.006
All right, I'm going
down to the bar.

00:59.073 --> 01:00.115
I'm ordering three beers.

01:00.116 --> 01:01.215
I'll see you guys
in five minutes.

01:01.216 --> 01:03.082
Three beers, five minutes.

01:03.083 --> 01:04.782
Love-30!

01:04.849 --> 01:06.415
Thanks for lending me
these boots.

01:06.482 --> 01:07.495
Where'd you get them from?

01:07.916 --> 01:10.216
This store in the Village
had one of those crazy sales.

01:10.283 --> 01:12.220
It was a footwear
feeding frenzy.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.430
I saw it first!

01:17.900 --> 01:19.950
You just made the list, bitch!

01:20.100 --> 01:21.055
So many questions.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.710
Firstly, what do you think
would happen

01:22.715 --> 01:24.865
if a guy walked into that store
wearing a suit of boots?

01:26.200 --> 01:28.240
You look fantastic in them,
Robin.

01:28.533 --> 01:30.830
But don't you think they're
a little high for that dress?

01:30.840 --> 01:32.074
Well, that's the point:
it's to hide that fact

01:32.141 --> 01:33.441
that I haven't
shaved my legs.

01:33.508 --> 01:35.408
I've begun
a strict no-shave policy

01:35.474 --> 01:36.574
for the first three dates.

01:36.641 --> 01:37.940
It's all about self-control.

01:38.007 --> 01:40.190
If I don't shave,
I must behave.

01:40.574 --> 01:42.241
FYI: It doesn't matter, baby.

01:42.308 --> 01:43.708
Guys just want to get
on the green.

01:43.775 --> 01:45.240
They don't mind going
through the rough.

01:45.940 --> 01:46.980
Shh-clackey!

01:49.000 --> 01:49.700
Stinson.

01:49.950 --> 01:51.170
All right,
the beers are here.

01:51.616 --> 01:52.445
Yeah, we're not going
to make it.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.416
Oh, come on! We agreed...

01:55.000 --> 01:56.135
Did Marshall take his pants off?

01:56.340 --> 01:57.239
Yeah, pants are off.

01:57.240 --> 02:01.460
??????????? ur
I needNEhe freedom and mobility
that only underwear can provide.

02:01.900 --> 02:02.500
Cheerio!

02:03.780 --> 02:04.605
Fine.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.220
I don't need friends.

02:06.230 --> 02:07.400
I got you guys.

02:07.405 --> 02:09.360
You guys are my friends,

02:09.365 --> 02:11.280
my cold refreshing friends.

02:12.185 --> 02:13.215
I'm talking to beer.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.325
Ted? Trudy.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.825
Trudy.

02:18.950 --> 02:21.490
Oh, my God. I haven't
seen you since...

02:24.200 --> 02:26.295
I slept with you and then
climbed down the fire escape.

02:26.467 --> 02:27.755
That was you?

02:28.133 --> 02:30.640
I'm kidding.
I was super-wasted.

02:31.350 --> 02:32.750
These are not all for me.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.755
No, I was going to call you,
but I was so embarrassed.

02:36.760 --> 02:37.980
You were embarrassed?

02:37.985 --> 02:39.252
I was like,
"I really like this guy,

02:39.318 --> 02:40.618
"and now I'm climbing out
his window,

02:41.150 --> 02:42.755
and I forgot my underwear..."

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Those were yours?

02:44.005 --> 02:45.705
God, I thought
they felt kind of tight.

02:46.140 --> 02:47.375
I'm kidding.
I don't wear underwear.

02:47.900 --> 02:48.820
Ladies' underwear.

02:48.950 --> 02:50.100
Often.

02:50.105 --> 02:51.530
Ah! Again, I'm kidding.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.350
I'm so glad I ran into you.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.460
I know. Do you want to?
Trudy?!

02:56.600 --> 02:58.300
No way!

02:58.305 --> 02:59.538
Oh, my God!
Rachel, how are you?

03:02.538 --> 03:03.900
Ted, this is Rachel.

03:03.905 --> 03:05.349
Hi!

03:05.350 --> 03:07.425
Kappa Epsilon Gamma!
Kappa Epsilon Gamma!

03:07.430 --> 03:08.325
Whoo!
Whoo!

03:08.800 --> 03:10.245
Wait, let me guess.
You guys met in prison.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.935
No! We were
sorority sisters.

03:14.940 --> 03:17.173
And best friends forever
all sophomore year.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.939
When we weren't
at each other's throats.

03:18.940 --> 03:20.374
We could be so competitive.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.315
Uh, but that's
all behind us now.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.380
Hey, mista! Hey, mista!

03:24.700 --> 03:26.300
Stay away from my sista!
Stay away from my sista!

03:26.305 --> 03:27.600
Whoo!
Whoo!

03:28.180 --> 03:29.750
We have so much
catching up to do.

03:29.755 --> 03:31.122
Okay. Are you going
to Stacey's wedding?

03:31.125 --> 03:32.791
Oh, it's off. Apparently,
he's into dudes.

03:32.858 --> 03:34.925
Nah! Again?!
That's like her third one.

03:34.991 --> 03:35.950
I know!

03:37.105 --> 03:38.585
Well, beers,
what do you want to do?

03:38.638 --> 03:39.900
We could stay here...

03:39.905 --> 03:42.145
or I know this other place
called "My Belly."

03:42.150 --> 03:44.290
So, Trudy and I
got a table.

03:44.517 --> 03:45.983
Oh, that's cool. I was going
to get out of here anyway.

03:46.050 --> 03:46.960
I'm really tired.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.905
I want you to stay.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.775
Tired of people who fold early,
'cause I am wide awake!

03:55.050 --> 03:57.375
Okay, guys... be cool.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.000
Aah!

04:14.005 --> 04:15.271
You've been
vanquished, old bean.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.200
That's 'cause
you distracted me.

04:17.204 --> 04:19.985
You've been hanging crumpet
ever since the third set.

04:23.205 --> 04:24.738
Ah... Stinson.

04:24.739 --> 04:26.670
I've got a situation.

04:26.773 --> 04:29.825
Trudy is here... you know,
from the pineapple incident?

04:29.906 --> 04:31.772
Oh, you mean the girl
that chalked your pool cue

04:31.773 --> 04:33.210
and then snuck down
the fire escape?

04:33.215 --> 04:34.470
Respect.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.040
So, we're hitting it off
and then her friend shows up

04:36.041 --> 04:38.550
and they're
kind of competitive.

04:38.555 --> 04:40.035
HJI think the new girl's
kind of into me.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.965
So you now have two on the line?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.355
And I don't know
which one to go for.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.650
Go for the new girl!

04:45.655 --> 04:47.670
Given the choice, always party
with Dr. Strangelove.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.940
New girl?
What new girl?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.940
ITwo girls are allegedly vying

04:50.945 --> 04:52.525
for Ted's affections,
and I think...

04:52.530 --> 04:53.985
Oh, you don't know
t what you're talking about.

04:53.990 --> 04:54.900
Give it to me.

04:54.905 --> 04:55.985
Are they friends?

04:55.990 --> 04:58.500
Yeah. Uh, no... I-I don't know.
They're old sorority sisters.

04:58.505 --> 04:59.500
Are they Betas?

04:59.505 --> 05:01.439
Because they're all sluts,
and you can tell them right now

05:01.505 --> 05:03.565
I didn't want to be
in their sorority anyway.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.865
They're Kappas, and...

05:06.150 --> 05:07.355
I think I can score
with one of them.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.400
I don't know which one,

05:08.405 --> 05:09.965
and if I chose wrong,
I lose them both.

05:10.039 --> 05:11.150
Okay, well, don't worry.

05:11.155 --> 05:12.955
I'll-I'll come down
and help you figure it out.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.825
I thought we were in
for the evening?

05:15.930 --> 05:18.267
That's what I thought about your
bangers and mash down there,

05:18.296 --> 05:20.050
but I guess we're both wrong,
guv'na.

05:22.729 --> 05:24.085
Hey.
Oh, Ted. Okay...

05:24.700 --> 05:26.100
Settle an argument.
Mm-hmm.

05:26.105 --> 05:28.270
Is it stealing if you go out
with someone's boyfriend

05:28.271 --> 05:29.685
after they've broken up?

05:30.540 --> 05:31.650
Well, that's
very complicated...

05:31.655 --> 05:33.240
See?! He agrees with me.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.970
You're such a little man-thief.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.780
You're the man-thief,
man-thief.

05:36.785 --> 05:38.805
Oh, somebody should lock
loyou girls up.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.280
You're so funny.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.580
I think Ted is funny.

05:44.700 --> 05:49.100
Really?
I think Ted is hilarious.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.570
I am never not wearing
a suit again.

05:52.052 --> 05:52.825
Hello?

05:52.830 --> 05:54.000
It's me. I'm at the bar.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.370
Don't look.
Just call me "Mom."

05:55.371 --> 05:58.804
Uh, hey, Mom.
How's Dad's... colon?

05:58.805 --> 06:00.940
What?
What's the matter with you?

06:01.730 --> 06:04.705
Anyway, both of these girls
are into you; take your pick.

06:04.710 --> 06:07.010
They are? Are you sure?
Yes, of course.

06:07.020 --> 06:09.086
They're playing with their hair
and touching your arm.

06:09.087 --> 06:10.385
Classic green light.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.075
Are you positive?

06:12.320 --> 06:14.655
Oh, that is so fascinating.

06:15.350 --> 06:16.655
So what happened?

06:16.800 --> 06:18.180
Well, after 18
hours of surgery,

06:18.185 --> 06:19.200
I closed,
and, thankfully,

06:19.205 --> 06:21.271
both girls just celebrated
their second birthday.

06:21.272 --> 06:24.772
Wow. Gosh, separating
conjoined twins,

06:24.775 --> 06:27.555
that must be
the most amazing feeling.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.432
True, but now the parents
don't know what to do

06:29.433 --> 06:31.730
with their huge supply
of four-legged overalls.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.899
That is so funny.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.450
You're so funny.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.870
Positive.
They both want you bad.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.390
It's a clearance sale
and you're the boots, baby.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.100
Oh, it's Robin.
Good luck.

06:46.105 --> 06:46.700
Bye, Mom.

06:47.941 --> 06:48.835
That's my mom.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.250
Hello?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.125
Bring me a razor.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.932
What about the no-shave rule?

06:52.939 --> 06:54.475
What happened
to your convictions?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.630
They've been surgically removed
by Dr. Awesome.

06:58.130 --> 06:59.280
No, I'm not doing it.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.964
The whole point to not shaving
was to...

07:00.965 --> 07:02.564
Lily, please!
He's really cute,

07:02.565 --> 07:05.000
and I really like him,
and he's got a British accent.

07:05.100 --> 07:05.965
I'm on my way.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.300
So this college boyfriend,
who won him?

07:09.700 --> 07:10.600
Neither of us.

07:10.940 --> 07:13.625
He left.
Junior year abroad.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.685
It's really
too bad, 'cause...

07:16.100 --> 07:19.860
there was that one thing
we wanted to do.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.432
We were
going to do...

07:21.433 --> 07:23.200
but we never did.

07:23.210 --> 07:26.343
Why? Wait, what were you guys
going to do but never did?

07:26.409 --> 07:27.610
No, it's too
embarrassing.

07:27.676 --> 07:28.999
You tell him.
No, you tell him.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.132
No, I don't care
if you don't care.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.066
Well, I don't care. I just...

07:31.132 --> 07:33.185
Nobody cares! Just say it.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.230
Why don't we tell him together.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.170
Okay.

07:37.866 --> 07:39.275
On three.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.080
One...

07:41.200 --> 07:42.990
Well, he's right:
it's a dead heat.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.880
...two...

07:45.040 --> 07:46.099
Neither one is
giving ground.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.820
I could not tell
who was the third wheel.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.433
...three.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.165
It's a tricycle.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.233
No way, no way, no way!

07:53.235 --> 07:53.860
What's happening?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.150
It's a tricycle.

07:56.154 --> 07:57.730
No way, no way, no way.

07:58.054 --> 07:59.055
It's a tricycle.

07:59.287 --> 08:00.499
Well, I'll just say it
right now.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.390
All sorority girls are sluts.

08:02.567 --> 08:03.790
Put him on speaker.

08:04.335 --> 08:06.050
So what you're saying
to us right now

08:06.051 --> 08:07.885
is that you have
a shot at the belt?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.398
Wait-wait-wait.
What belt?

08:09.399 --> 08:10.966
Ho
Well, Barney and I have

08:10.967 --> 08:12.566
this running joke that the first
guy to actually pull this off

08:12.567 --> 08:14.399
would "win"
the championship belt.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.400
Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt,
right?

08:18.050 --> 08:19.195
Behold...

08:20.950 --> 08:22.390
You actually bought a belt.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.045
That's right. It's resplendent.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.880
Come on, it was
just a thing we said.

08:26.980 --> 08:27.950
We were kidding around.

08:27.955 --> 08:28.915
I never kid.

08:29.140 --> 08:30.500
Remember you said if I ever
slept with that girl

08:30.504 --> 08:31.965
from Days of Our Lives,
I'd be the king?

08:32.138 --> 08:33.150
Well...

08:37.636 --> 08:39.304
Why wasn't I told
about the belt?

08:39.371 --> 08:40.470
I could go for the belt.

08:43.970 --> 08:47.485
If Lily would've died before me,
then I could ride the tricycle.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.735
If I died, I would just come
back and haunt your penis.

08:50.736 --> 08:52.735
Guys, come on! Help me out.
What do I do?

08:52.736 --> 08:55.568
All right, Ted, if you're
going to go for the belt,

08:55.569 --> 08:58.050
then the bylaws require me
to ask the following questions:

08:58.055 --> 09:01.460
One: Is the aggregate age
of all participants under 83?

09:01.700 --> 09:02.470
Yes.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.565
Two: Is the aggregate weeght
of all participants

09:04.566 --> 09:06.232
under 40unpounds?

09:06.233 --> 09:07.170
Yes.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.940
Theodore Mosby...

09:09.434 --> 09:10.966
are you paying these women?

09:10.967 --> 09:12.515
What? No.

09:13.150 --> 09:14.555
Ted...

09:14.650 --> 09:15.817
go g
T'reo th

09:15.883 --> 09:18.620
I inherited my dad's imaginaryrossues.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.755
hM
Oh, are you guys leaving?

09:22.900 --> 09:25.935
Well, it is getting
pretty late.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.079
Right. Well, well, it's been...

09:28.080 --> 09:29.946
Maybe we could all go
listen to that Wilco CD

09:30.013 --> 09:31.140
CB
you talked about before.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.846
Great!
I have it right upstairs.

09:34.850 --> 09:37.055
It's in my apartment upstairs.
Let's go upstairs.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.595
I'm sorry. Where was
your apartment again?

09:39.660 --> 09:41.600
Ha, that's funny. I love that.

09:41.726 --> 09:43.895
You should tell more jokes
in my apartment upstenrs.

09:48.227 --> 09:51.326
Scenario #12:
We're in a horrific car crash.

09:51.393 --> 09:53.260
You die. I'm left paralyzed.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.860
Two sexy nurses,
with a six-pack of wine coolers,

09:55.927 --> 09:57.059
sneak into my room
late at night.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.400
I try toHolit them
he Morse code.

09:59.426 --> 10:03.410
"Please, don't.
I love my dead wife."

10:03.426 --> 10:04.860
But they're medical
professionals,

10:04.927 --> 10:07.480
and I got to think, somehow,
they're saving my life.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.059
Fine. Sleep with your nurses.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.880
Tonight you ride the unicycle.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.820
I already did this morning.

10:17.350 --> 10:17.900
Hello.

10:17.905 --> 10:20.905
Lily, I have pounded three
cappuccinos waiting for you.

10:20.971 --> 10:22.305
Pretty soon,
I won't have to shave...

10:22.372 --> 10:24.725
the hair is going to vibrate
off my legs.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.510
I'm sorry, I can't leave now.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.150
Lily, he can't see
my legs like this.

10:28.168 --> 10:29.885
I look like a Turkish lesbian.

10:31.301 --> 10:34.101
There's, um, a pharmacy
across the street.

10:34.168 --> 10:35.535
Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?

10:35.600 --> 10:36.750
No, but 50 will.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.065
Hold on. Ted's textg me.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.550
"We're combing up-sars."

10:45.100 --> 10:46.999
"Combing up-sars."
What does that mean?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.160
It means they're
coming upstairs.

10:56.467 --> 10:57.701
Got 'em.

11:00.467 --> 11:03.280
Ooh! Nice place.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.267
Hey, are these
your roommates?

11:05.270 --> 11:07.920
Yes. Uh, yes,
but they are not here.

11:08.036 --> 11:09.510
They are somewhere else.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.100
We have total privacy

11:11.105 --> 11:15.130
because privacy is essential
when you're listening to music.

11:16.045 --> 11:18.720
You know what else is essential
when you're listening to music?

11:19.900 --> 11:21.215
Music.

11:21.466 --> 11:22.966
That's hilarious.

11:23.033 --> 11:24.165
You are hilarious!

11:24.299 --> 11:25.666
I'll go get it
in my bedroom.

11:25.733 --> 11:26.885
The CD's in my bedroom.

11:27.199 --> 11:28.259
Bedroom...

11:28.260 --> 11:30.570
I
Okay. We'll try
and stay out of trouble.

11:30.727 --> 11:32.215
Of course,
we can't promise anything.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.950
This is going to be awesome.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.610
No!

11:44.200 --> 11:45.900
????????????

11:45.910 --> 11:47.442
We know, Ted, well done.

11:47.509 --> 11:48.843
This is very impressive.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.676
Up top.
Yeah, bro, up top.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.043
Oh, don't be gross.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.699
You guys need to
get out of here.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.500
Please, take the fire escape.

11:55.566 --> 11:56.465
No, no way.

11:56.570 --> 11:58.350
The other day I saw
a pigeon take a crap on it

11:58.355 --> 12:00.375
and the whole thing shifted.

12:01.422 --> 12:02.850
Oh, you can use
our bedroom.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.455
Okay, all I need
to seal the deal

12:04.522 --> 12:06.010
is the Wilco CD, Barney.

12:10.921 --> 12:11.689
What are you doing?!

12:11.754 --> 12:13.888
allow Ted to do this.

12:13.955 --> 12:15.110
Wh-what? Why?

12:15.115 --> 12:16.947
Because the belt
is my birthright!

12:16.948 --> 12:18.382
You cannot claim it before I do.

12:18.449 --> 12:21.215
That would be like Jimmy Olsen
capturing Lex Luthor

12:21.282 --> 12:23.715
while Superman watches
impotently from the bedroom.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.210
But, Barney, you've done
way dirtier stuff than Ted.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.805
You're disgusting.

12:29.633 --> 12:31.375
I've never ridden the tricycle.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.233
I was on the verge
last year.

12:33.234 --> 12:34.567
I was so close.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.700
So ladies, why don't
we move is party

12:39.705 --> 12:42.080
to a more horizontal location?

12:43.100 --> 12:44.805
Oh, my God,
my new carpet!

12:44.810 --> 12:46.110
Oh, my God, this
is a disaster.

12:46.115 --> 12:47.681
You get the carpet cleaner.
I'll get a towel.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.052
Okay.
I'll get the video camera.

12:49.117 --> 12:50.860
Get out!
Okay then.

12:51.351 --> 12:52.584
So let me get
this straight.

12:52.585 --> 12:54.183
You're going to trike-block me?

12:54.184 --> 12:56.880
That is so petty.
It's like you're...

12:57.900 --> 12:59.350
Tom Petty.
Tom Petty.

12:59.355 --> 13:00.454
You're Tom Petty.

13:00.455 --> 13:01.625
Where's Lily?

13:05.600 --> 13:06.700
Still looking for that CD,

13:06.950 --> 13:08.932
so...

13:11.200 --> 13:12.084
What are you doing?

13:12.085 --> 13:13.953
I knew it.
I had a hunch about that girl

13:14.020 --> 13:15.120
and I was right.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.770
I saw it first!

13:19.550 --> 13:21.375
You just made the list, bitch.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.465
I cannot give up my bedroom
to a boot thief.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.496
She should be punished,
not rewarded.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.967
Fine, then I'll try to work in
a little light spanking.
Just do this for me!

13:30.034 --> 13:31.030
No, never.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.982
What if I reimburse you
for the boots, full retail?

13:32.983 --> 13:35.190
Please enjoy our bedroom.
Great.

13:35.551 --> 13:36.290
Just take it.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.090
Okay, wish me luck.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.833
Oh, my God.
It looks fine.

13:46.834 --> 13:47.920
You're such a girl.

13:50.050 --> 13:51.033
Whe's the shaving cream?

13:51.035 --> 13:52.365
you di

13:52.535 --> 13:53.550
Well, it was implied.

13:53.555 --> 13:55.289
Who buys a razor
without buying shaving cream?

13:55.356 --> 13:57.035
Well, who doesn't shave
their legs for a date?

13:57.122 --> 13:59.200
Well, who's not getting a tip
because of her attitude?

13:59.205 --> 14:00.605
Well, here's a little tip
for you:

14:00.672 --> 14:03.445
shave your legs before you leave
the house, Sasquatch.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.072
Hey, Robin, um, the valet's
brought the car around.

14:10.074 --> 14:11.390
I thought we'd go to my place,

14:12.070 --> 14:13.299
if you're in the mood
for a nightcap.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.440
Absolutely. I just have to go
to the ladies' room.

14:16.601 --> 14:17.580
I've got TB.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.840
Tiny bladder.

14:20.940 --> 14:21.950
I'll meet you out front.

14:22.140 --> 14:22.900
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:37.806 --> 14:38.760
You've got to be kidding me.

14:42.070 --> 14:43.480
Excuse me. Sorry.

15:03.450 --> 15:05.425
So, I'm having a little
trouble finding the CD.

15:06.049 --> 15:07.725
That's okay.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.300
We don't need music to have fun.

15:11.314 --> 15:12.725
Exactly.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.800
You do like to have
fun, don't you, Ted?

15:27.700 --> 15:29.210
It's getting late.
I'll get your coats.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.900
"I'll get your coats"?!

15:34.905 --> 15:36.572
I don't know why I said that.
Why'd I say that?

15:36.638 --> 15:37.905
It's the opposite
of what I meant.

15:37.972 --> 15:39.835
I wanna take clothes off them,
not put more on.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.925
Ted, you're ruining this
for everyone.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.395
Leave him alone!

15:45.335 --> 15:46.350
Sometimes even

15:46.355 --> 15:48.500
the greatest warriors
shoot themselves in the foot.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.485
What are you
talking about?

15:50.832 --> 15:54.467
If you must know, it wasn't
a freak beverage malfunction

15:54.470 --> 15:56.530
that stopped me from riding
the tricycle that night.

15:56.970 --> 15:58.870
So, Barney, why don't we

15:58.936 --> 16:02.230
take this party to a more
horizontal location?

16:14.800 --> 16:16.820
Oh, no, the night's ruined!

16:16.825 --> 16:17.800
No, baby, it's not.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.300
Yes, it! Whatever this night
was heading towards is ruined.

16:20.304 --> 16:21.190
Where's my coat?

16:23.020 --> 16:24.636
Why would you do that
to yourself?

16:24.640 --> 16:26.145
Because you get up
in your head, man.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.074
You start thinking,

16:28.075 --> 16:30.075
"I can't do this.
It's two women."

16:30.141 --> 16:32.149
That's two of everything,
four of some things.

16:32.150 --> 16:35.240
The logistics alone are enough
to cripple even a pro like me.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.605
See, if a complete degenerate
like Barney choked,

16:37.606 --> 16:39.050
what chance do I have?

16:40.700 --> 16:41.930
The best chance in the world.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.235
Fear took the belt from me.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.585
Fear rode the tricycle
that night, my friends.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.290
But fear will not get
a second turn.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.735
It won't?
No.

16:57.140 --> 16:59.855
Because I now realize
it isn't my destiny
to win the belt.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.674
It is my destiny to help
my friend win it.

17:04.641 --> 17:07.685
Ted is fated
to go there first.

17:08.707 --> 17:10.795
He is our Neil Armstrong.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.508
Spacesuit up, Ted,

17:13.510 --> 17:14.598
'cause you're going
to the moon.

17:14.599 --> 17:15.525
Step one.

17:18.742 --> 17:19.839
Ladies.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.444
I couldn't find your coats,

17:21.450 --> 17:23.717
but I did find... tequila.

17:26.983 --> 17:28.585
Wait, wait, wait,
a remote control fireplace?

17:28.983 --> 17:30.485
We don'Hot have
a remote control fireplace.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.100
Right, that's my apartment.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.500
The dressing gown's mine, too.

17:33.550 --> 17:34.740
Damn, this should be me.

17:34.983 --> 17:36.000
Anyway, continuing...

17:38.816 --> 17:40.816
Whew!

17:42.484 --> 17:45.083
I am so exhausted.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.305
So exhausted.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.495
Wait, why would I want
to tire them out?

17:50.650 --> 17:52.997
That's your excuse
to unleash pretext

17:53.000 --> 17:54.510
for physical contact #1.

17:56.134 --> 18:01.235
Oh, you give
the most amazing foot massage.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.400
That's 'cause I used to practice

18:03.404 --> 18:05.255
all the time on my grandmother.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.065
Why in God's name
would I say that?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.885
It's endearing.
You're a caregiver.

18:10.133 --> 18:12.220
Never take family values
out of the equation.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.020
Step three.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.033
Ted, what's wrong?

18:17.035 --> 18:20.775
I was just thinking about
this documentary I saw once

18:22.070 --> 18:24.155
about something
called a super volcano.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.700
Okay, what the hell?

18:26.750 --> 18:27.575
Wait for it.

18:28.050 --> 18:29.595
It can happen at any time.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.530
And obliterate
all life on Earth,

18:33.100 --> 18:35.705
which is why
I live by three simple words.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.800
Don't postpone joy.

18:41.901 --> 18:43.195
Oh, my God.

18:44.068 --> 18:45.620
That's so true.

18:45.967 --> 18:47.170
Yeah.

18:50.767 --> 18:52.090
The mortality angle.

18:52.233 --> 18:53.475
That's actually pretty good.

18:55.850 --> 18:57.360
I can do this.
Yes, you can.

18:57.483 --> 18:59.616
Yeah.
I can't believe I'm
going to say this,

18:59.683 --> 19:01.248
but I'm actually moved.

19:01.249 --> 19:02.440
Bring it in, guys.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.155
All right.

19:11.830 --> 19:13.155
I'll see you on the other side.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.510
So what happened next?
Did you do it?

19:48.600 --> 19:49.995
It doesn't seem right
to talk about it.

19:50.630 --> 19:52.560
What? No! Tell me.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.025
Don't tell me
because you don't have to

19:56.030 --> 19:57.290
because you didn't do it.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.995
You didn't do it.
You did it.

19:59.996 --> 20:01.462
You did it, didn't you?

20:01.463 --> 20:02.525
Did you?

20:03.250 --> 20:04.200
You didn't do it.

20:04.350 --> 20:06.016
Yes, you did.
You did.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.083
No, you didn't.

20:07.149 --> 20:08.110
Tell me!

20:09.083 --> 20:11.400
Some stories you tell,
some stories you don't.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.390
That's because you didn't do it.

20:14.900 --> 20:15.940
He didn't do it.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.283
You did itu
You did it, didn't you?

20:18.284 --> 20:19.530
You did it.
Tell me, did you?

20:19.900 --> 20:21.500
Ted, belt. Did you?

20:21.503 --> 20:22.630
Did you or didn't you?

20:22.670 --> 20:23.705
Did?

20:24.137 --> 20:25.875
Tell me, please.
For the love...

20:26.300 --> 20:27.215
Do you know
if he did or didn't?

20:28.033 --> 20:29.200
Oh, hey, um,
Hmm?

20:29.205 --> 20:30.935
would you go in there
and see if my date's okay?

20:31.715 --> 20:32.680
No problem.

20:32.747 --> 20:33.340
Thank you.

20:40.900 --> 20:45.220
No, nobody's in there,
but the window's actually open.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.600
I guess I shouldn't be
so surprised.

20:47.604 --> 20:49.470
I mean, she was acting weird
all night, right?

20:49.475 --> 20:51.660
Yeah, you know...

20:52.900 --> 20:54.260
why don't I buy you a drink?

20:55.267 --> 20:56.245
Okay.

20:56.970 --> 20:58.945
Did I overhear
that you're a surgeon?

20:59.237 --> 21:00.720
Guilty as charged.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.955
Oh, you're so funny.

21:04.667 --> 21:05.700
I'm here!

21:05.767 --> 21:07.086
I'm fine!

21:07.733 --> 21:09.185
My head is bleeding.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.755
Going down again.

21:10.760 --> 21:32.860
