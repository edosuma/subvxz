00:39.667 --> 00:41.000
I'm hungry.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.125
Here.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.333
You like eating, huh?

01:01.375 --> 01:03.667
We don't feed you a lot

01:04.417 --> 01:06.667
because we don't want you to get fat.

01:10.167 --> 01:11.542
Get dressed.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.958
What's your name?

01:20.500 --> 01:22.542
What's your name?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.042
María.

01:25.458 --> 01:27.458
I told you, not María!

01:32.958 --> 01:35.625
What did I tell you your name was?

01:42.125 --> 01:44.208
Your name is Jessy.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.792
What's your name?

01:51.958 --> 01:54.208
I can't hear you, bitch!

01:54.875 --> 01:56.625
- Jessy.
- Jessy.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.708
- And what are you?
- I'm a slut.

01:59.375 --> 02:02.042
- I'm a slut.
- I'm a slut.

02:02.125 --> 02:05.292
HYPERSOMNIA

02:11.000 --> 02:15.458
Go to Balcarce and Humberto Primo.

02:18.958 --> 02:22.542
NOW?

03:10.708 --> 03:13.542
I'M HERE

03:37.958 --> 03:39.667
- Hello?
- <i>Hi babe, where are you?</i>

03:39.792 --> 03:41.958
- I'm still at the audition.
- <i>Still?</i>

03:42.042 --> 03:43.958
I can't talk right now,
I'll call you later.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.208
<i>Okay, but...</i>

03:45.625 --> 03:48.292
I'm at the bar across the street.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.083
When...

03:52.375 --> 03:55.875
Godard chose and actor or actress,

03:56.083 --> 03:57.917
he bought them a dinner.

03:58.292 --> 04:00.292
The actor would go to a restaurant,

04:00.917 --> 04:01.958
a fancy one,

04:02.083 --> 04:05.333
he would sit down to eat,
thinking he was alone,

04:05.458 --> 04:07.958
but it turns out Godard was hidden,

04:08.042 --> 04:10.750
stalking him, from a distance,

04:10.875 --> 04:15.208
watching what the person he was
going to be working with was like.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.875
I want you,

04:18.958 --> 04:20.625
if it turns out to be you,

04:20.875 --> 04:24.125
to jump into the abyss
of your raw material,

04:24.208 --> 04:27.917
but jump with confidence.

04:28.292 --> 04:30.833
This is a role that can be
a breakthrough,

04:30.958 --> 04:33.333
if you play it well, of course.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.417
And if you obey everything I say.

04:35.708 --> 04:36.958
Everything.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.167
You have potential,

04:39.333 --> 04:42.750
an important amount of sensuality,
but if you don't let it flow

04:42.958 --> 04:44.875
it's as if it didn't exist.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.083
There is no sin in art.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.250
Think about it.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.292
I'll be right back.

05:07.292 --> 05:08.492
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

05:08.583 --> 05:09.292
Good.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.083
- The usual?
- Yes.

05:13.958 --> 05:15.167
Thank you.

05:25.083 --> 05:27.250
Sorry, I was running late.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.583
- Pour me another?
- I think you're mistaken.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.917
I don't think so.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.750
Laura.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.208
Laura?

05:42.417 --> 05:45.250
I'm at a very important job interview

05:45.375 --> 05:49.000
- and it depends on this a lot.
- Yeah, my job also depends on this.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.583
You're also auditioning?

06:06.708 --> 06:08.375
You're very pretty.

06:11.208 --> 06:12.208
Thank you.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.875
So you're an actress?

06:16.333 --> 06:17.917
That's what I'm trying to be.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.250
And what type of actress
do you want to be?

06:21.417 --> 06:22.792
I don't know.

06:23.375 --> 06:24.792
A complete one.

06:25.958 --> 06:27.917
And what does that mean?

06:28.625 --> 06:32.375
I guess it's being an actress
who can do a bit of everything.

06:33.833 --> 06:36.167
Comedy, drama, musical.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.417
It's always better to be complete.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.250
It looks like your boyfriend
likes to watch.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.708
What boyfriend?

07:03.458 --> 07:05.625
You want the role?
Go with her.

07:06.958 --> 07:08.208
Should we go?

08:09.958 --> 08:13.000
<i>Good... Like that.</i>

08:20.917 --> 08:22.125
I have to go!

08:49.208 --> 08:51.542
No... Stop it.

08:51.625 --> 08:54.000
Okay...

09:08.208 --> 09:10.125
Come to the theater.
Last chance.

09:46.958 --> 09:48.167
Fede.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.083
<i>Get on the stage...</i>

09:54.083 --> 09:56.250
<i>and take off your trench coat.</i>

10:03.167 --> 10:05.250
<i>Move closer to the light.</i>

10:23.375 --> 10:25.167
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

10:25.833 --> 10:27.417
<i>And don't move.</i>

11:47.042 --> 11:48.542
What happened?

11:51.750 --> 11:52.958
Nothing.

11:53.958 --> 11:55.625
Where did you go?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.292
To the theater.

11:59.792 --> 12:01.917
At 4:00 a.m.?

12:03.792 --> 12:05.458
Yes, I had a rehearsal.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.417
Don't lie to me anymore.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.417
The role is yours.

12:24.083 --> 12:27.500
The arms hanging at the sides of the body

12:27.667 --> 12:30.042
and the breathing lowered.

12:30.167 --> 12:33.958
You breathe in through the nose
and out through the mouth, like this.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.458
Let's turn the head.

12:40.833 --> 12:42.417
We breathe in.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.958
And now we're going to close our eyes

12:48.083 --> 12:50.500
and we're going to imagine
that there's a white screen,

12:50.667 --> 12:53.125
all white with a small black hole,

12:53.250 --> 12:56.000
and you're going to enter
through that black hole.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.125
You advance towards it.

13:01.958 --> 13:03.542
Good.

13:03.708 --> 13:06.625
You turn to your left like a pinwheel.

13:07.583 --> 13:12.167
Faster, faster, faster, faster...

13:12.333 --> 13:16.417
Faster, faster, faster, faster, enough!

13:17.958 --> 13:21.708
And now you trust me,
let yourself fall backwards.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.583
- We're... What's this?
- I don't know.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.333
What is this?

15:10.250 --> 15:14.333
Please, if you ever get out of here
call my parents, look for them.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.500
My name is María Rivas.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.143
Look for them, tell them I'm alright,

15:20.167 --> 15:22.958
that nothing's happened to me.
Please, help me!

15:23.083 --> 15:26.167
Tell them to come pick me up, please!

15:41.333 --> 15:43.333
No, please!

15:43.500 --> 15:45.542
Don't touch me anymore.

15:45.667 --> 15:46.958
Ariel, no!

15:47.083 --> 15:50.167
- "One-arm!"
- No!

15:55.583 --> 15:58.250
Let me go, please...

16:01.583 --> 16:03.708
Keep quiet!

16:03.917 --> 16:05.250
C'mon, stop it!

16:06.750 --> 16:08.250
Please!

16:10.500 --> 16:13.167
One-arm! Come on, let's go.

16:13.583 --> 16:14.958
Come on, let's go!

16:15.083 --> 16:18.917
- Help me, please!
- You and I are going to talk later.

16:18.958 --> 16:20.292
Please...

16:22.167 --> 16:25.917
No! Don't take me! Please! Don't take me!

16:26.542 --> 16:28.792
No!

16:29.500 --> 16:32.583
I can't breathe! Help!

16:32.750 --> 16:34.250
Help me!

16:42.917 --> 16:44.833
Please!

16:45.667 --> 16:47.250
I can't breathe!

16:49.583 --> 16:52.708
Not the red room! No!

16:56.958 --> 17:00.333
- What are they doing to you? What?
- Please.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.917
Please help me, please help me...

17:03.333 --> 17:06.958
No, no, he's here! Please!

17:07.500 --> 17:08.833
One-arm?

17:09.500 --> 17:10.916
Come here.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.000
Come on.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.583
Good.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.750
Sex, drugs, blood and death.

18:23.833 --> 18:25.250
Laly?

18:27.250 --> 18:28.667
Let's go.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.583
Don't make this harder for me.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.333
- I was somewhere else just now.
- No.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.583
You were here.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.500
In the room.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.250
Let's go, you have to work.

18:57.958 --> 19:00.167
You know that if One-arm
shows up it's worse.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.750
Let's go.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.500
Hello.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.333
What's your name?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.083
You're not going to say hello to me?

20:24.417 --> 20:26.042
Arturo.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.250
It's a pleasure.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.583
Where are you going?

20:37.833 --> 20:40.750
Stay calm.

20:42.750 --> 20:43.958
Come here.

21:09.417 --> 21:12.375
<i>We invite everyone to join us
this weekend, Sunday at 9 PM,</i>

21:12.500 --> 21:16.500
<i>in the Municipal Park. Don't miss it.</i>

21:16.667 --> 21:19.833
<i>The entire neighborhood is invited.
Don't miss it.</i>

21:35.500 --> 21:39.083
I want to go back.

21:39.542 --> 21:40.875
- Hey, Laly.
- I want to go back.

21:40.958 --> 21:43.500
I want to go back.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.333
Honey, Laly.

21:46.292 --> 21:48.958
- Laly.
- I'm not Laly.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.542
I don't know what I'm doing here,
but I have to go back.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.333
My love, we all want to go back.

21:57.500 --> 22:01.875
I miss my family too.
But you can't go nuts, okay?

22:02.292 --> 22:05.542
- I'm not crazy.
- Do you know who you are?

22:05.917 --> 22:08.208
Do you know where you are? Look at me.

22:08.917 --> 22:10.250
Look at me...

22:12.292 --> 22:13.667
No.

22:18.625 --> 22:21.000
That's it, it's over.

22:21.167 --> 22:24.917
It's that shit they put in our blood,
you're just hallucinating, nothing else.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.583
I love you.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.958
Roxy...

22:39.917 --> 22:41.417
Come here.

22:41.833 --> 22:43.792
Come here, honey.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.292
- Come on, Ms. Romantic.
- Coming.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.833
I'll be right back.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
- What's up?
- Your girlfriend is completely crazy.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.243
She's going to ruin everything,
so she'll have to stay.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.226
If she doesn't come,
no one's getting out of here.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.059
Don't you realize she's going
to screw things up?

23:02.083 --> 23:04.292
- Shut up.
- What? What's wrong, bitch?

23:04.417 --> 23:05.934
- Shut your mouth!
- I want to go back.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.958
Say it again and I'll beat
the crap out of you.

23:08.042 --> 23:09.125
Her name is María.

23:10.750 --> 23:11.875
What?

23:12.208 --> 23:13.708
Her name is María.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.167
Yes, María is her real name.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.125
Is she alive?

23:19.792 --> 23:22.083
They took her to a red room.

23:23.250 --> 23:24.250
Where?

23:34.792 --> 23:36.958
You have to go work, Laly.

23:38.833 --> 23:40.083
Go.

23:40.417 --> 23:41.667
No.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.667
- You've got to come.
- Wait.

23:47.917 --> 23:50.000
She doesn't feel well, take me.

23:50.417 --> 23:52.167
You're staying here.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.667
No, they chose you.

23:58.167 --> 23:59.417
No...

24:39.042 --> 24:40.292
Hello.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.167
Come here.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.000
You're shy.

25:18.292 --> 25:19.458
ANOTHER TURN

25:37.833 --> 25:39.958
So it wasn't a dream.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.042
No.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.958
I have a feeling that I wasn't here.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.083
Here, where?

25:49.917 --> 25:52.042
I was acting in the play.

25:54.167 --> 25:55.958
I closed my eyes

25:56.917 --> 25:58.958
and I was being held hostage in a house.

25:59.042 --> 26:00.542
<i>- Laly.
- Laly.</i>

26:00.667 --> 26:03.375
- <i>I'm not Laly.</i>
- They called me Laly.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.917
Like in the play.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.583
I began to live and remember

26:07.958 --> 26:09.792
as if I was her.

26:10.250 --> 26:12.833
As if I belonged to that place.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.167
When I was a little girl,

26:17.333 --> 26:19.500
something very similar happened to me.

26:20.083 --> 26:22.833
I was playing at home with my uncle

26:23.500 --> 26:26.333
and suddenly I felt
like I was somewhere else.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.417
I had a little dog named Ginger.

26:32.542 --> 26:35.500
<i>I remember that another dog
came by and she got loose.</i>

26:36.542 --> 26:37.917
<i>I ran after her,</i>

26:38.958 --> 26:40.583
<i>but I didn't find her...</i>

26:42.750 --> 26:45.833
<i>and, suddenly, I was back at home
with my uncle.</i>

26:46.917 --> 26:49.875
And I was desperately
yelling out "Ginger!"

26:51.000 --> 26:52.292
Ginger!

26:55.333 --> 26:58.083
And he told me we'd never had a dog.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.708
And when did your uncle die?

27:01.208 --> 27:02.583
Two years ago.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.167
Hello.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.958
- Hello.
- I'm Gustavo, nice to meet you.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.625
- Milena.
- What a pleasure, welcome.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.917
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
- Should we read?
- Yes.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.250
Are you okay? Is something wrong?

27:18.333 --> 27:19.917
Yes, I'm a bit nervous.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.625
I can imagine, and as the days pass
it's going to get worse.

27:22.750 --> 27:26.125
This Federico guy
is kind of dangerous, he's a little...

27:26.417 --> 27:29.958
He's a bit deranged. He hasn't worked
with the same actor twice in his career.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.708
The only one he's been able to work
with again is me. Know why?

27:32.833 --> 27:34.792
Because he knows he can't mess with me.

27:34.917 --> 27:36.250
Did he do something to you?

27:36.583 --> 27:37.917
No.

27:38.667 --> 27:41.958
If anything happens, tell me.
He listens to me.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.500
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

27:44.833 --> 27:46.934
- You have to project your voice.
- I don't know how to do that.

27:46.958 --> 27:48.833
What are you muttering, Gustavo?

27:48.917 --> 27:50.125
Okay, nothing, I'm sorry.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.750
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

27:51.833 --> 27:54.583
- Let's do it and then it'll show up.
- Okay, come on.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.667
Come on. Take charge, Milena.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.083
- Come on.
- Okay, you start, come on.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.875
Come on, we always improvise, right?

28:00.958 --> 28:03.208
- Go! Improvise.
- Come on, let's go, now!

28:03.333 --> 28:05.292
- I'm not going to go.
- You have to go!

28:05.583 --> 28:09.500
You have to go because the man paid!
He paid a fortune for you!

28:09.667 --> 28:12.625
I'm not going to be here listening
to you say you don't want to!

28:12.750 --> 28:14.710
- What are you working as?
- What's wrong, Milena?

28:14.750 --> 28:16.750
Why aren't you using your voice
or acting?

28:16.917 --> 28:17.958
Sorry.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.167
Sorry what?

28:20.542 --> 28:22.125
I don't think it's like this.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.542
What's not like this?

28:25.292 --> 28:27.417
She would never fall in love
with a kidnapper.

28:27.583 --> 28:30.958
Yes, she would fall in love
to save her own life.

28:31.250 --> 28:33.833
She'd do it for love or she'd fake it.

28:41.375 --> 28:42.542
Mile.

28:43.083 --> 28:44.417
What are you doing here?

28:44.583 --> 28:47.250
- I wanted to see you.
- I told you not to come.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.958
- Come on, I'm worried about you.
- Stop it, Nico.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.693
Ever since you started this thing
you're all over the place.

28:52.833 --> 28:54.958
Are you really going to throw us away?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.958
What's going on with this guy? Eh, Mile!

29:14.417 --> 29:16.667
Sleep disorder.

29:26.042 --> 29:27.958
Sleep disorder.
Drowsiness, snoring.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.250
Hypersomnia.

29:36.833 --> 29:39.000
Capability of falling asleep
for a second at daytime.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.833
- I'm not going in there again.
- Come on, be good.

29:41.958 --> 29:43.500
No, I don't want to go there.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.393
- I don't want to go.
- Come on, it's your job.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.893
- I'm not going.
- You're making it worse.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.837
- I don't want to go.
- I know you don't want to.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.208
- Okay, I beg you, please...
- You have to learn.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.934
- I'm not going. I won't.
- This is your job.

29:52.958 --> 29:53.958
What do you want from me?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.958
I'm not going to go, it disgusts me,
I don't want to go.

29:57.083 --> 30:01.333
Look at the attitude
this actress stands with on stage.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.250
- I don't want to go, I'm not doing it.
- Who is she?

30:05.500 --> 30:08.042
- Your understudy.
- I'm telling you I'm not going.

30:08.167 --> 30:09.708
All plays have understudies.

30:09.917 --> 30:10.792
You're hurting me.

30:10.917 --> 30:11.917
Don't bother me anymore!

30:11.958 --> 30:14.958
And she asked me to be naked
during the scene.

30:15.125 --> 30:17.583
- I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
- No, it was weird though.

30:18.333 --> 30:19.458
No, I fell weirdly.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.383
- I was improvising.
- Do you think it's okay?

30:34.125 --> 30:35.125
Come on.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.542
- I'm not going to go.
- Come on.

30:37.667 --> 30:38.958
I'm not going.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.583
- Come on, be good, it's your job.
- No, please, no.

30:41.708 --> 30:42.958
- Count up to ten.
- No.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.292
Count up to 1000.

30:44.583 --> 30:45.958
No!

30:49.167 --> 30:51.333
No, stay calm.

30:51.625 --> 30:52.958
Stay calm.

30:54.250 --> 30:55.750
It's just a dream.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.000
- No, it wasn't a dream.
- Yes.

30:58.583 --> 31:01.917
The smells, the sounds, it was very real.

31:02.667 --> 31:06.500
You were dreaming. That's it,
it's over. You're here with me.

31:07.958 --> 31:10.583
You were talking in your sleep.
You said "Milena", who is that?

31:12.500 --> 31:13.750
I don't know.

31:14.375 --> 31:16.250
Everything's getting mixed up.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.750
I don't know what's real anymore.

31:20.708 --> 31:22.458
I remember you.

31:24.833 --> 31:26.250
This place.

31:28.792 --> 31:31.708
Stay calm, it's normal,
it happens to me too.

31:31.833 --> 31:34.792
Sometimes I dream
about my mom and my sisters,

31:34.917 --> 31:37.917
and I'm there with them and I'm happy,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.958
and I wake up and I'm here,

31:40.250 --> 31:41.667
and it was a dream.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.333
But you know, it's like that,
as the day drags on

31:44.500 --> 31:47.583
it starts disappearing
and a few days later it's gone.

31:48.708 --> 31:51.208
It's this shitty place.
We're going to leave soon.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.708
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

31:55.583 --> 31:57.250
And the windows are all covered.

31:57.333 --> 32:00.083
I don't know if it's the capital
or the province, I don't know.

32:00.333 --> 32:03.750
Don't even think about asking
because they can rat you out, got that?

32:04.583 --> 32:06.250
Don't ask.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.250
María... It's María.

32:50.417 --> 32:52.667
Fuck. God damn it.

32:55.125 --> 32:56.625
Move, bitch.

32:57.083 --> 32:58.375
Flip her.

33:00.583 --> 33:01.917
Fuck!

33:02.167 --> 33:04.667
Look at me. Maria!

33:06.958 --> 33:08.500
María, look at me.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.250
We have to escape before The Gardener
chooses another one.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.000
It's impossible.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.833
Do you want to end up like María?
Did you see what they did to her?

33:42.667 --> 33:43.917
Don't count me in.

33:44.167 --> 33:45.750
You know you can't.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.893
What do you want me to do?
What are we going to do?

33:47.917 --> 33:49.667
I don't know, but you can't be out of it.

33:52.167 --> 33:54.167
Let me go!

33:55.083 --> 33:57.333
- I don't want to!
- You need to shower.

33:59.667 --> 34:02.833
Wash her up
and get that piss smell off of her.

34:08.833 --> 34:12.417
Hey, everything's okay.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.750
Open your eyes.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.917
It's okay, breathe.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.958
Look at me, you're okay.

34:21.417 --> 34:24.917
- I don't want them to touch me, please!
- You're okay, don't worry.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.917
No, I want to go home. Please, help me.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.375
Breathe, you have to breathe.
You're here.

34:31.667 --> 34:33.833
There's a way for you
to make it through the night.

34:33.958 --> 34:35.667
- Shut up.
- What?

34:35.833 --> 34:36.833
What?

34:37.333 --> 34:39.583
If you're beaten up,
they can't present you.

34:40.500 --> 34:41.500
Hit me.

34:41.667 --> 34:44.792
- Do you not understand when I talk to you?
- Hit me, please.

34:44.917 --> 34:47.833
- Don't you see that's she's just a kid?
- Hit me! I'm begging you!

34:47.958 --> 34:50.583
Please! Please hit me!

34:51.000 --> 34:53.958
- Please! Hit me!
- Shut up! Stop it!

34:54.000 --> 34:55.958
- Hit me, please!
- No!

34:56.000 --> 34:58.208
- Let her hit me!
- No! No!

34:58.333 --> 34:59.833
Please, hit me.

34:59.958 --> 35:03.750
- Can you please calm down?
- Hit me, please.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.958
Please hit me!

35:16.167 --> 35:18.167
What the fuck is going on here?

35:20.250 --> 35:21.708
What did you do to her?

35:21.833 --> 35:23.750
Look at how you left her!

35:24.000 --> 35:25.375
Pick her up.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.500
We're going to talk to each of you later.

35:29.667 --> 35:31.792
We're going to talk to each of you.

35:31.917 --> 35:33.375
Bitches!

35:34.292 --> 35:35.792
Come on, walk.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.792
<i>We invite everyone
to join us this weekend,</i>

35:47.917 --> 35:50.042
<i>Sunday at 9 PM,</i>

35:50.167 --> 35:52.042
<i>in the Municipal Park.</i>

35:52.167 --> 35:54.042
<i>Don't miss it.</i>

35:54.167 --> 35:58.167
<i>The entire neighborhood is invited.
Don't miss it.</i>

36:03.250 --> 36:04.750
Malu.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.333
Malu.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.333
Stay calm. Sit up.

36:10.958 --> 36:12.333
Slowly.

36:14.958 --> 36:17.125
There we go. Stay calm.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.500
This is going to make you better.

36:29.417 --> 36:30.833
Help me.

36:32.250 --> 36:34.417
Please, help me.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.583
Please...

36:38.167 --> 36:41.917
Please, I want to see my family.
Let me go, please...

36:43.958 --> 36:45.500
I can't.

36:48.417 --> 36:50.750
Please don't go on like this,
it'll get worse for you.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.958
The best thing to do is to accept it...

36:57.167 --> 36:58.417
and go on.

37:00.458 --> 37:01.792
Accept it.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.250
What are you doing?

37:16.417 --> 37:18.583
Leave that one and go get Roxy.

37:20.083 --> 37:21.333
Come on!

37:25.583 --> 37:27.792
- Stay calm.
- No, why? Get off!

37:29.333 --> 37:32.417
- No! Why? Let me go!
- Come with me.

37:33.958 --> 37:37.167
Let me go, goddamnit, let me go!

37:38.833 --> 37:40.042
Let me go!

37:40.167 --> 37:41.833
See how she ended up?

37:42.417 --> 37:44.000
You're going to end up worse.

37:44.667 --> 37:47.417
Get off me!

37:48.417 --> 37:51.500
- I don't want to! No!
- Roxy!

37:51.667 --> 37:55.417
- Roxy!
- Stop, bitch! What are you doing?

38:18.958 --> 38:20.250
Bravo!

38:39.500 --> 38:43.000
Good job Milena.
You're on the other side now.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.417
You have to save her.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.333
We can't do anything.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.583
She's with The Gardener.

39:00.250 --> 39:01.833
And who's The Gardener?

39:02.458 --> 39:04.042
What does that mean?

39:05.750 --> 39:08.083
The Gardener is what we call him,

39:08.583 --> 39:10.167
no one knows him.

39:10.583 --> 39:13.250
It's a dude who pays a lot to torture.

39:13.917 --> 39:15.542
He's the one who did that to María.

39:16.167 --> 39:19.500
That right there, that means
that The Gardener picked her.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.583
And what does "The Gardener" mean?

39:22.750 --> 39:25.167
Apparently the dude
collects flowers, I don't know.

39:25.750 --> 39:28.250
He's a client who enjoys the girls' pain.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.333
Roxy!

39:38.167 --> 39:39.750
- What did they do to her?
- Nothing.

39:39.917 --> 39:41.833
She's going to be okay, stay calm.

39:42.167 --> 39:43.792
She's going to be okay. Here.

39:43.917 --> 39:45.250
Here.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.208
The sugar will be good for her, okay?

39:47.333 --> 39:49.500
She's not going to be okay,
The Gardener chose her.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.958
You know that if you don't help us

39:52.000 --> 39:54.083
you're as much of a bastard
as that murderer, right?

39:54.750 --> 39:55.958
You know?

40:15.833 --> 40:18.958
Stay calm. Don't be like that.

40:22.208 --> 40:24.292
Sooner or later,
you're going to go through.

40:28.667 --> 40:31.417
- You see? There's nothing left.
- No.

40:44.917 --> 40:46.125
Take this.

40:47.958 --> 40:48.958
No.

40:50.208 --> 40:51.500
Look at me.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.750
It's going to help you.

41:09.833 --> 41:11.625
- Stay calm.
- Who are you?

41:11.750 --> 41:13.833
- It's me, stay calm.
- No.

41:13.958 --> 41:15.833
No, you're not Laly. Get out.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.000
- Yes, it's me.
- No! You're someone else, get off!

41:20.167 --> 41:21.375
Move.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.083
- Where's Laly?
- Stay calm.

41:23.333 --> 41:26.875
- Where's Laly?
- Shut up or they'll hit us all.

41:26.958 --> 41:28.667
- Where is she?
- Stop it!

41:33.500 --> 41:34.958
Fuck.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.500
No, I don't smoke.

42:16.208 --> 42:18.000
I told you I don't smoke.

42:22.125 --> 42:23.875
I want a mirror.

42:26.375 --> 42:27.583
No.

42:29.167 --> 42:31.083
No, no mirrors here.

42:31.667 --> 42:32.750
They're forbidden.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.958
I don't remember what I look like.

42:40.292 --> 42:41.667
You're pretty.

42:45.917 --> 42:47.750
What's going to happen to Roxy?

42:49.417 --> 42:50.750
I don't know.

42:58.208 --> 43:00.125
What Lola told you...

43:00.333 --> 43:01.917
She's not right.

43:16.708 --> 43:18.208
Yes, she is right.

43:19.417 --> 43:21.125
I think you're different.

43:28.625 --> 43:29.958
I don't know.

43:36.667 --> 43:38.917
But I'm also not that different from you.

43:40.208 --> 43:41.708
I can't leave.

43:44.875 --> 43:46.958
We're both locked in.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.625
Why can't you leave?

43:50.167 --> 43:51.958
People think they're free...

43:56.667 --> 43:59.583
but we're all trapped
from the moment we're born.

44:01.417 --> 44:04.750
Sometimes I feel like
I'm somewhere else...

44:05.750 --> 44:07.333
and I have another life.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.750
We all want to be
someone else for a while.

44:17.083 --> 44:19.500
But once you come in here,
you can never leave.

44:23.417 --> 44:24.667
Never.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.542
All of that is an escape...

44:32.667 --> 44:34.750
to endure all of this,

44:34.917 --> 44:36.500
to not be afraid.

44:39.833 --> 44:42.250
When I'm with you, I'm not scared.

44:55.833 --> 44:57.250
Listen.

45:01.125 --> 45:02.583
It's windy.

45:05.958 --> 45:07.292
It's going to rain.

45:12.083 --> 45:14.125
We should go back.

45:28.500 --> 45:29.667
Are you okay?

45:29.833 --> 45:32.292
- It just happened.
- What?

45:32.583 --> 45:34.583
I was just somewhere else.

45:34.958 --> 45:36.167
I was Laly.

45:36.375 --> 45:38.042
No, Milena.

45:38.417 --> 45:40.167
You never left this room.

45:42.417 --> 45:44.292
She doesn't have
the slightest idea how to act.

45:44.458 --> 45:47.498
I try, I give her tips, but she doesn't
have a clue. She hasn't been trained.

45:47.542 --> 45:49.500
Do you think
that what you're saying adds up?

45:49.667 --> 45:52.292
Respect her, she's not all there,
she's a good girl.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.500
But why don't you hire
a professional, a real actress?

45:55.667 --> 45:58.917
An actress wannabe who never took
an acting class in her fucking life?

45:59.125 --> 46:02.750
Do you feel something for her?
Tell me the truth, I can handle it.

46:02.875 --> 46:05.851
- But if you tell me she's an actress...
- Yes, I believe in her as an actress

46:05.875 --> 46:07.708
- and I think she'll do it well.
- Okay.

46:07.833 --> 46:09.500
- That's what's going on with me.
- Hello.

46:09.667 --> 46:12.309
- She had to be here today, but she isn't.
- Hi babe, what happened?

46:12.333 --> 46:15.333
- Sorry.
- No, apologize to them.

46:17.833 --> 46:18.958
Come on, Nai.

46:19.583 --> 46:20.750
How are you?

46:21.167 --> 46:23.000
- Forgive me.
- It's okay, what happened?

46:23.167 --> 46:24.500
I'm having some health issues.

46:24.667 --> 46:26.500
Okay, Gustavo?

46:26.667 --> 46:29.917
Let's use this energy you have
show up now in the acting.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.500
You can't go crazy.

46:33.833 --> 46:36.583
<i>You're here... with me...</i>

46:36.917 --> 46:38.750
<i>Come here...</i>

46:43.417 --> 46:44.833
No!

46:45.500 --> 46:48.750
Get me out of here! Open the door!

47:46.958 --> 47:48.833
I don't like what you do.

47:49.917 --> 47:51.167
How are you?

47:52.500 --> 47:54.250
You look so pretty with this new look.

47:54.333 --> 47:56.417
- You like it?
- I love it.

47:56.958 --> 47:58.375
How's your head after the blow?

47:58.500 --> 48:01.000
- Fine.
- Should we rehearse?

48:02.125 --> 48:03.375
Enjoy.

48:03.667 --> 48:05.583
Give your partner a kiss.

48:06.958 --> 48:08.417
I like it, I like it.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.980
- Should I try it like this?
- I like it, walk around a little.

48:11.167 --> 48:13.875
- Small. Hide it.
- Okay.

48:13.958 --> 48:17.333
Relax and concentrate.
Whenever you're ready.

48:31.917 --> 48:33.542
What are you doing? What's wrong?

48:35.250 --> 48:36.750
It was my fault.

48:38.958 --> 48:40.333
No, it's not your fault.

48:40.875 --> 48:42.500
It's not anyone's fault, it happens.

48:42.667 --> 48:44.417
Before or after, but it happens.

48:45.917 --> 48:47.750
We have to get out of here.

48:58.042 --> 48:59.375
It's over.

49:00.250 --> 49:01.667
It's over.

49:08.917 --> 49:10.625
Everything's going to be okay.

49:10.875 --> 49:12.542
Where's Roxy?

49:13.417 --> 49:15.333
It doesn't matter where Roxy is.

49:16.083 --> 49:17.333
Where is she?

49:18.333 --> 49:19.833
She's in the red door.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.958
If you make trouble,
they'll kill you too.

49:38.375 --> 49:40.958
Lola, the boss wants to talk to you.

49:41.417 --> 49:42.667
Perfect.

49:43.583 --> 49:45.667
I'm going with Yasmín, okay, One-arm?

49:52.083 --> 49:53.542
Okay, let her come.

49:54.583 --> 49:55.833
This way.

50:28.917 --> 50:30.833
Who wants to escape?

50:31.000 --> 50:32.917
They'd like to leave this place.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.625
All of them want to escape.

50:34.750 --> 50:38.500
You come here to work. If one
of you tries to escape, I'll kill her.

50:38.667 --> 50:40.333
We're not going to work anymore.

50:40.583 --> 50:42.208
- You're not going to work?
- Let go!

50:42.333 --> 50:44.167
Leave her alone, let her talk.

51:06.583 --> 51:09.333
With that Gardener torturing us,
none of us are going to work.

51:09.833 --> 51:11.708
And where did you get that from?

51:11.833 --> 51:13.583
Roxy is with The Gardener.

51:14.417 --> 51:16.167
The Gardener killed María.

51:16.958 --> 51:18.417
Is that true?

51:19.292 --> 51:20.708
She didn't do anything.

51:22.583 --> 51:26.333
I'll take care of it. Go to work.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.750
Go!

51:34.667 --> 51:35.875
Come here.

51:36.500 --> 51:37.625
Wait.

51:41.417 --> 51:44.000
I need the girls to continue to work.

51:44.583 --> 51:45.917
We have to stop.

51:46.750 --> 51:47.833
Okay.

51:47.958 --> 51:50.167
Tell The Gardener he has to stop.

51:50.333 --> 51:51.417
No.

51:51.667 --> 51:54.667
- No, not me, I don't want to.
- Don't worry.

51:55.208 --> 51:56.625
Stay calm.

51:57.167 --> 51:58.750
Nothing's going to happen.

51:58.958 --> 52:00.542
It's just for a while,

52:00.917 --> 52:02.792
until things calm down.

52:04.208 --> 52:05.708
No, I don't plan on talking to him.

52:05.833 --> 52:08.000
He's not going to leave,
he doesn't want to leave!

52:08.417 --> 52:10.500
He's going to leave.

52:24.667 --> 52:28.250
I bought him a few things
for the red room.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.000
I'm not going to take them to him.

52:34.250 --> 52:36.226
I already told you,
I don't want to see him anymore.

52:36.250 --> 52:37.500
Stay calm.

52:38.250 --> 52:40.000
Tell him to come see me.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.958
Everything's going to be alright.

52:44.333 --> 52:45.750
Yes, mom.

52:45.958 --> 52:46.958
Go.

52:47.417 --> 52:48.833
Go, boy.

53:14.167 --> 53:15.458
What are you doing here?

53:15.583 --> 53:18.000
No! Get out of here!

53:18.167 --> 53:21.667
Get out of here! Leave! Please, leave!

53:21.833 --> 53:24.233
- Please! It's dangerous!
- I'm going to get you out of here.

53:24.333 --> 53:26.958
No, I'm already dead, it doesn't matter.

53:27.167 --> 53:30.625
Please, when you get back outside,
call my mom and my dad.

53:30.750 --> 53:32.292
Their name are Omar and Alicia,

53:32.417 --> 53:34.542
please, call them
and tell them I'm okay, okay?

53:34.667 --> 53:37.750
- Promise me.
- Yes.

53:37.917 --> 53:39.917
Four, six, five...

54:49.875 --> 54:52.958
No!

56:14.667 --> 56:18.167
Omar and Alicia.

56:21.583 --> 56:24.833
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, is this Omar and Alicia's house?

56:24.958 --> 56:27.125
No. Who is it?

56:27.250 --> 56:28.458
A friend of their daughter.

56:28.583 --> 56:33.000
No, I'm the owner of the house,
they moved when the girl disappeared.

56:33.833 --> 56:35.193
<i>And you don't know where they are?</i>

56:35.250 --> 56:37.333
No, I honestly don't have a clue.

56:37.583 --> 56:39.000
I liked it.

56:39.875 --> 56:41.042
It's going well.

56:43.458 --> 56:44.875
What are you doing here?

56:45.167 --> 56:46.792
I have to leave the play.

56:47.625 --> 56:49.585
What do you mean
you can't continue with the play?

56:49.833 --> 56:51.000
I have to go.

56:51.167 --> 56:55.250
You have a signed contract,
you can't leave. Goddamn it!

56:55.500 --> 56:58.750
Where the hell are you going?
Who do you think you are?

56:59.917 --> 57:02.667
You made it here
because I gave you the opportunity.

57:02.958 --> 57:05.417
And if you leave,
I'll make sure you never step foot in

57:05.583 --> 57:08.167
another theater in your fucking life,
do you understand?

57:10.167 --> 57:13.083
Did you fucking understand me?

57:16.667 --> 57:19.167
Good morning, Miss.
Do you have more data?

57:19.583 --> 57:21.183
- Omar and Alicia.
- With that I can't...

57:21.333 --> 57:22.667
- Last name?
- I don't know it.

57:22.750 --> 57:24.417
I'll be with you in a minute,
take a seat.

57:24.500 --> 57:26.750
<i>I don't have any more data.
I need to find her.</i>

57:27.500 --> 57:29.333
Rodríguez?

57:32.833 --> 57:34.333
WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU

57:51.667 --> 57:54.333
What you're saying doesn't make sense.
Are you hearing yourself?

57:54.667 --> 57:57.042
Yes, it's true. Laly exists

57:57.167 --> 57:59.167
and I have some sort
of connection with her.

57:59.333 --> 58:01.333
Babe, what's going on? You're obsessed,

58:01.500 --> 58:04.667
look what you did to your hair.
What's going on with that play?

58:04.833 --> 58:06.500
Enough of that.

58:06.750 --> 58:08.250
I left the play.

58:12.583 --> 58:14.559
I'm telling you, there's someone
who looks just like me

58:14.583 --> 58:16.042
and they're looking for her.

58:17.958 --> 58:20.500
How is it possible
that there's someone just like you?

58:23.292 --> 58:25.292
Call this phone number.

59:16.458 --> 59:18.250
Oh, Laly!

59:28.583 --> 59:31.542
Carlos! My love!

59:31.667 --> 59:34.917
Sweetheart...

59:43.875 --> 59:45.958
My little girl!

59:52.917 --> 59:55.000
I left everything
how it was on the last day.

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:19.708
Could you leave me alone for a while?

01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:21.583
Yes, of course.

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.250
Of course.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:28.167
If you need anything,
I'll be here. Just call me

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.750
and I'll come, okay?

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.333
LALY, WE MISS YOU

01:00:52.667 --> 01:00:54.667
Thank you for taking care of her.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.583
For everything.

01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:02.250
Do you have any other children
apart from Laly?

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.333
No, it's just us three.

01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:08.750
She never talked to you about a girl
who looked very similar to her?

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:19.167
I have an angel who takes care of me.

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:21.643
I call her when something bad happens.
She comes and I hide away.

01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:23.167
We never believed her.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.500
We thought she was talking about an
imaginary friend or something like that.

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:31.500
But a little over a year ago, before
she disappeared, we were with Laly

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:34.833
and we saw a girl who looked
exactly like her on the bus.

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:38.917
So there's a possibility
that Laly could have a twin sister?

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:40.750
It's a very difficult story.

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:46.458
Her parents abandoned her,
they left her in a garbage can.

01:01:47.333 --> 01:01:48.667
They told us

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.167
that it could be traumatic for her,

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.042
so we decided not to tell her.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:55.500
But yes...

01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:58.708
she could have a sister.

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.458
<i>Ginger!</i>

01:02:03.042 --> 01:02:04.667
Ginger!

01:02:06.667 --> 01:02:08.625
Don't worry Laly,
we're going to find her.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.958
I'm not Laly, I'm Milena.

01:02:14.083 --> 01:02:16.958
Such a long time not knowing about her...

01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:20.750
I don't know... We don't know what to do.

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:22.333
Laly!

01:02:23.958 --> 01:02:26.500
Stay calm, I'll talk to her.

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:49.667
Laly is adopted.

01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:53.917
Your uncle never said anything
about a twin sister?

01:02:57.667 --> 01:02:59.583
But I always felt something.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.417
We're connected somehow,

01:03:03.583 --> 01:03:06.042
and when something bad
happens to her, I take her place.

01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:07.893
<i>We invite everyone
to join us this weekend...</i>

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.833
- Did you hear that?
- What?

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:11.417
We're close to Laly.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.167
- Are you sure?
- Yes, let's go find her.

01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:39.333
UNKNOWN NUMBER

01:03:41.958 --> 01:03:43.000
Hello?

01:03:43.417 --> 01:03:45.000
Hello? Babe?

01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:46.583
Who is this?

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:49.667
<i>It's me, Milena, I'm inside the house.</i>

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:52.125
- <i>But you're here with me.</i>
- No.

01:03:52.292 --> 01:03:53.333
<i>How do you see me?</i>

01:03:53.417 --> 01:03:56.833
I don't know, you're like asleep,
like in a trance.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.958
What's going on here? What did you do?

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.792
Mile? No, Mile!

01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:04.833
Mile!

01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.083
You're coming with me!

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.750
Milena! Mile!

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:19.167
What happened? You're alright.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.833
We have to look for her.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.250
<i>We invite everyone
to join us this weekend...</i>

01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:27.250
<i>Sunday at 9 PM, in the Municipal Park.</i>

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:29.893
<i>Don't miss it. The entire neighborhood
is invited. Don't miss it.</i>

01:04:29.958 --> 01:04:31.542
That truck.

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.792
I heard it from the other house.

01:04:34.167 --> 01:04:35.917
We're very close.

01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:54.625
Stop.

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:57.958
Do you hear that?

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.167
We're close to Laly.

01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:09.958
Stop.

01:05:14.917 --> 01:05:16.042
It's there.

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:18.208
Are you sure?

01:05:18.417 --> 01:05:20.667
- Yes.
- Okay, let's call the police.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.673
No, we don't have time,
we have to go find her.

01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:25.583
Wait. You go find help and I'll go in.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.000
Who are you?

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:35.875
I'm here to see Lola.

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:38.375
I'll open the door.

01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:49.583
Stop.

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:51.750
Stop!

01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:55.167
What's wrong, dude?

01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:56.958
I'm Milena's boyfriend.

01:05:58.833 --> 01:05:59.958
Who?

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:04.333
I'm with Laly.
We came to look for all of you.

01:06:05.292 --> 01:06:06.458
Who?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.875
Where's the red door?

01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:19.792
The red door is on the left,
at the end of the hall.

01:06:19.917 --> 01:06:22.792
It's not that easy though, there's
an old man who walks by all the time.

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:25.583
You have 15 minutes
until he walks by again.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.083
I'm going to get you out of here.

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:31.417
15 minutes.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.667
Help! I need help. Please, help me!

01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:30.833
Are you okay?

01:07:33.167 --> 01:07:34.833
We have to get her out of here.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.667
Give me money.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:40.458
Why?

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.383
Give me money,
do you want to help her or not?

01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:51.958
He wants to stay another half hour.

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:08.125
Come in.

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:11.476
He's with Laly, don't worry.
He's going to get us out of here.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.875
We have to organize everything
we've been planning, it's now, okay?

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:18.167
Leave her back there. Come on!

01:08:23.082 --> 01:08:25.667
How the hell did you break out?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.417
Bitch.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.417
What are you doing? Put that down!

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.082
Didn't you hear what the boss said?

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:59.957
This bitch was asking for help
on the street.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.917
I'll make sure
you didn't lose any others.

01:09:04.832 --> 01:09:06.042
Come on.

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:13.332
This is wrong.

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.277
You're going to get us all killed!

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.750
- Let go of me.
- No!

01:09:16.832 --> 01:09:18.082
Let me go, you bitch!

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.917
Fuck! Hide!

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.582
What the hell is going on here?

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:35.332
Talk.

01:09:36.832 --> 01:09:38.167
They want to escape.

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:40.500
I don't have anything to do with it.

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:10.208
I knew it, you fucking bitch.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.083
- What happened, bitch, did you rat?
- Stop.

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.417
Are you so fucking scared
that you ratted on us?

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:19.583
- Bitch!
- Don't you realize what you did?

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:21.000
- Stop!
- Hey you!

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:22.542
Who is that?

01:10:23.333 --> 01:10:24.417
- López?
- It's the boss.

01:10:24.583 --> 01:10:25.750
What do we do?

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:27.777
I know what we do. Get on the bed!

01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.167
Get on the bed!

01:10:30.167 --> 01:10:31.667
López?

01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:33.292
Lóp...?

01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:34.875
Oh, well...

01:10:37.958 --> 01:10:41.167
Finish doing what you're doing
and send me the girl I asked for.

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:48.333
Let's go girls. Let's go!

01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:05.417
The exit's that way. Take these,
I took them from the old man.

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:07.500
What about you?

01:11:07.667 --> 01:11:09.750
We're not leaving until we kill everyone.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.750
Let's go.

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:50.500
Let's go!

01:11:54.167 --> 01:11:55.167
No.

01:11:55.333 --> 01:11:56.708
No, I want to help.

01:11:56.833 --> 01:11:58.833
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.

01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:02.583
They just got one of the girls,
I need your help.

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:04.083
Milena!

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:05.500
Where is she?

01:12:05.833 --> 01:12:07.042
Where is she?

01:12:07.167 --> 01:12:08.375
Come here.

01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:10.333
Come this way, come on.

01:12:42.917 --> 01:12:45.417
No!

01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:51.708
Listen to me, everything's going to hell.

01:12:51.917 --> 01:12:53.837
- Don't tell me.
- All of the girls are escaping.

01:12:53.917 --> 01:12:54.917
Me too.

01:12:54.958 --> 01:12:57.750
You should have killed your son long ago.
You know this is his fault.

01:12:57.917 --> 01:12:59.750
What do you want me to do? He's my son.

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:02.667
You handled it horribly, the people
from Remanso are going to find out.

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:06.333
- No one's going to find out anything.
- Start getting the money ready.

01:13:07.833 --> 01:13:08.958
One-arm!

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.917
No...

01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:21.542
No, please...

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.833
Not with her... No!

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:24.500
I'm not afraid when I'm with you either.

01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:28.833
You don't mess with me,
you fucking bitch.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:33.250
Let me go! Fuck!

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.917
Cockroaches...

01:15:55.583 --> 01:15:57.958
Cockroaches...

01:16:00.583 --> 01:16:03.167
Cockroaches...

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:50.583
Cockroaches...

01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:54.125
Cockroaches...

01:16:55.083 --> 01:16:57.542
Cockroaches...

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.750
Cockroaches...

01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:04.167
One of the girls is bloodstained,

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:07.333
there are others in the ambulance,
I'm not sure if we can cross

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.208
the police perimeter.

01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:11.958
They're going to assist...
I'm sorry, careful.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.250
Follow me. Excuse me.

01:19:13.417 --> 01:19:16.000
Can we ask what happened, girls?
Were you locked up?

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:19.250
There they are and they don't want
to talk. They're bloodstained.

01:19:19.417 --> 01:19:21.542
There are four or five girls.

01:19:21.667 --> 01:19:24.125
The police are arriving
at this very moment.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:27.250
Careful. Here in Riglos and Tunuyán,

01:19:27.417 --> 01:19:31.958

by a human trafficking network.

<i>A woman from my neighborhood</i>

<i>about a job that involved travel.</i>

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:53.333
<i>I wanted to be a model.</i>

01:19:53.667 --> 01:19:57.250
<i>I saw a casting call on Facebook.</i>

01:19:57.417 --> 01:19:59.250
<i>They got me in my underwear.</i>

01:20:00.333 --> 01:20:01.833
<i>And they told me I was very pretty.</i>

01:20:01.958 --> 01:20:04.500
<i>I was leaving my house,</i>
<i>I was two blocks away,</i>

01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:06.750

<i>I had to go wait on the corner...</i>

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:19.625
<i>They put me in a truck.</i>
<i>They covered my mouth.</i>

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.250
<i>Before getting on the bus,</i>
<i>we drank something.</i>

01:20:22.375 --> 01:20:25.184
<i>It probably had something in it,</i>
<i>because I don't remember anything else.</i>

01:20:25.208 --> 01:20:26.583
