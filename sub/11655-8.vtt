I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.302 --> 00:12.889
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

Quiet!

03:45.476 --> 03:49.021
Before the birth of Aku...

03:50.189 --> 03:52.984
before the ancient gods,

03:53.067 --> 03:57.113
it was the Titans that ruled all things

03:57.196 --> 04:00.783
and Cronus was their king.

04:01.784 --> 04:06.289
He understood the secrets
of time and space

04:06.372 --> 04:11.586
and fashioned for himself three gems:

04:12.962 --> 04:15.590
The eye of Cronus,

04:15.715 --> 04:19.594
to focus his vision
of the universe or time.

04:19.677 --> 04:22.805
Fists of might and ability,

04:23.264 --> 04:27.393
to grasp onto the cosmic essence.

04:28.644 --> 04:29.687
With these,

04:29.771 --> 04:34.525
he alone held the power
to command all eternity.

04:36.486 --> 04:39.822
But as Cronus' power grew,

04:39.906 --> 04:44.786
so, too, did his arrogance and paranoia.

04:44.869 --> 04:50.458
His appetite drove him to madness!

04:54.212 --> 04:59.550
Until his own son Zeus
rose to challenge him.

04:59.634 --> 05:03.095
Cronus was dethroned and imprisoned

05:03.179 --> 05:06.891
in the cold depths of space.

05:09.227 --> 05:12.480
He was stripped of his mighty gems,

05:12.563 --> 05:14.774
which Zeus cast earthward

05:14.857 --> 05:20.655
in hopes that they would be lost forever.

05:31.082 --> 05:33.125

we can tear a hole in the fabric of time
