WEBVTT

01:23.383 --> 01:24.784
Where's my primer?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.590
Vada, we're late!

01:31.458 --> 01:33.493
- Vada.
- Mmm.

01:38.798 --> 01:41.601
- God...

02:04.591 --> 02:05.758
Dude,
we are so fucking late!

02:05.825 --> 02:07.760
Are the cake pops
different flavors

02:07.827 --> 02:09.696
or are they just
different colors?

02:09.796 --> 02:11.131
<i>Different flavors.</i>

02:11.197 --> 02:12.699
What are
the flavor differences?

02:24.177 --> 02:26.546
Honestly, it is a miracle
that we made it on time.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.348
Dude, we are killing it!

02:28.448 --> 02:29.549
Per ushe, yes.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.151
Also, is it just me
or does coffee

02:31.217 --> 02:33.219
immediately make you
have to shit?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.288
- Oh, immediately, yeah.
- Like I smell coffee
and I'm shitting my pants.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.790
Pause the shit-talking
till Justin Dragonas passes.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.062
Oh, my God, I want him.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.564
We need to come up with a code
for shitting.

02:45.465 --> 02:46.399
You're right!

02:46.499 --> 02:48.067
Alright, let's think.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.069
- Okay, like--
- We can say like
I need to talk to my boss.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.238
- What are you talking about?
- Are you picking
what I'm putting down?

02:52.338 --> 02:55.008
It's like, "Okay, I need to
have a long call with my boss

02:55.074 --> 02:56.342
and he's mad."

02:56.409 --> 02:58.077
Oh my God,
my boss is so mad at me

02:58.178 --> 02:59.312
that I got a penis call
this morning.

02:59.379 --> 03:00.680
Oh, and then when you...

03:00.747 --> 03:02.649
It could be like you're texting
your boss.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.684
You're texting
your boss. I love it.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.386
- We love that.
- You have to keep it fancy.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.421
We love
to keep it fancy,
that's what we do.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.391
Now that's also a concern
because most of that water
is paleo water.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.860
Dating back to the most rec...
Yes, Vada?

03:13.927 --> 03:16.563
Does the kind of rock affect
how long the aquifer last

03:16.663 --> 03:18.331
or how quickly it recharges?

03:18.398 --> 03:20.200
Oh, that's a great question,

03:20.266 --> 03:22.101
but that depends on
many factors.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.703
Anybody wanna guess

03:23.770 --> 03:26.172
what the next biggest
aquifer is?

03:26.239 --> 03:27.440
So we have to think about
what we know

03:27.540 --> 03:29.008
about the aquifers, right?

03:29.075 --> 03:32.111
So the Ogallala Aquifer is one
of the largest eight

03:32.212 --> 03:34.113
in the world,
not to... Yes?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.548
I'm sorry,
can I use the restroom?

03:35.615 --> 03:36.749
Yes.

03:36.849 --> 03:39.118
It dates back
to the recent ice age.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.787
So when we think about that
we have to say, "Wow,

03:40.887 --> 03:42.689
this is one of the largest
in the world."

03:43.957 --> 03:45.191
Are you okay?

03:45.258 --> 03:46.793
- No.
- <i> What happened?</i>

03:49.729 --> 03:51.297
I don't want anyone to hear me.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.033
Dude, literally just tell me,
you're freaking me out.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.637
I got my...

03:58.938 --> 04:01.541
What? I can't hear you.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.076
I'll just text it to you.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.118
Jesus, Amelia!

04:12.218 --> 04:17.457
You don't text 911
when you get your period!

04:17.557 --> 04:20.226
<i> You scared the shit</i>
<i>out of me. Oh my God!</i>

04:21.427 --> 04:22.462
I'm sorry.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.467
It's okay.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.005
Wait, haven't you been dyin'
to get your period
for like a year?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.306
I thought you'd be stoked.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.075
It's different than I thought.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.011
Oh, you mean shitty as hell?
Yeah, I know.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.146
You're the worst.
I'm hanging up now.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.582
<i> I'm sorry, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

04:42.649 --> 04:44.083
Do you, um...

04:46.452 --> 04:48.688
have everything you need?

04:48.788 --> 04:52.692
Yeah, I stole it from your room
a few months ago.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.327
It's in my backpack.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.030
Just in case.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.665
<i> I was just gonna</i>
<i>tell you to stuff a bunch</i>
<i>of toilet paper</i>

04:58.765 --> 05:00.133
<i>in your pants till</i>
<i>you get home,</i>

05:00.199 --> 05:03.836
but that...
That's some pro-level shit.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.039
Nice move!

05:06.139 --> 05:07.307
Oh, my God.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.209
<i> How about this?</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:12.045
<i>Let's go to dinner tonight,</i>
<i>just you and I, okay?</i>

05:12.145 --> 05:13.546
<i>And I will fill you in</i>

05:13.646 --> 05:18.951
on all the bloody, chunky,
gooey, goopy details.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.553
Ew, shut up.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.654
I love ya.

05:22.522 --> 05:23.956
Congratulations.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.025
Don't say congrats, you freak.

05:30.863 --> 05:31.898
I love you, too.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.651
Photo day.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.487
Better get my shit together.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.746
You don't even need
to wear makeup.

06:54.781 --> 06:55.948
Sorry, what?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.619
I just said, "You don't even
need to wear makeup."

07:01.220 --> 07:02.622
- I...

07:02.722 --> 07:05.825
- What was that?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.427
- Come on, come on!

07:07.493 --> 07:09.295
- Was that a gun?
- Get down!

07:13.399 --> 07:14.267
Take 'em off!

07:15.468 --> 07:16.469
No! Oh!

07:32.618 --> 07:33.853
We're gonna die.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.289
Go, go, go, go, go!

07:50.336 --> 07:53.139
Oh my God. Oh my God.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.342
Is it over?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.377
Is it over?

08:07.720 --> 08:08.721
Who's in there?

08:10.156 --> 08:12.225
I'm not the shooter.
It's Matt Corgan, I saw him.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.395
Do you know where he is now?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.997
I don't know, I don't know.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.834
My brother.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.503
Come, come under. Just...

08:33.646 --> 08:35.348
Oh, fuck, are you shot?

08:36.716 --> 08:39.018
My brother.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.778
You! Drop your weapon!

09:05.878 --> 09:07.513
Drop your weapon now!

09:10.883 --> 09:13.019
Down on the ground!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.655
Maybe we should
wake her up.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.557
She needs to rest.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.225
I just wanna
talk to her.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.196
Did you know him?

10:32.531 --> 10:34.667
He follows you on Instagram,
so he knew you.

10:37.436 --> 10:38.838
It's like on every channel.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.307
Like CNN was interviewing
your friend Melody.

10:41.874 --> 10:42.975
So crazy.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.012
Did you know anyone who died?

10:46.112 --> 10:47.613
- Amelia.
- What?

10:48.881 --> 10:50.349
Is there like a list
or something?

10:56.689 --> 11:00.226
Sometimes, I'm just like,
"What year are we living in?"

11:00.326 --> 11:03.062
I'm literally gonna Amazon
a bulletproof backpack.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.563
Amelia!

11:04.664 --> 11:05.665
What?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.571
Please don't cry, Mom.

11:13.739 --> 11:14.974
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.593
Do you need something?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.264
Was just gonna take a bath.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.566
Okay

11:44.370 --> 11:45.271
Okay.

14:16.488 --> 14:17.656
Fuck.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.489
I'm glad
you're going to see Nick.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.758
How's he holding up?

16:00.826 --> 16:01.760
I think okay.

16:02.695 --> 16:03.662
Good!

16:04.763 --> 16:05.664
Good.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.173
What about you?
How... How are you feeling?

16:23.816 --> 16:24.683
Better.

16:26.051 --> 16:28.053
That's good,
so good.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.155
I'm really so glad
to hear that.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.798
I literally thought
it was a drill

16:39.865 --> 16:41.567
'cause Cambie had us locked in,

16:41.667 --> 16:43.068
shades over the window
in like two seconds,

16:43.168 --> 16:45.237
so I was like, "Okay, clearly,
this is a drill."

16:45.337 --> 16:46.505
- Right?
- Yeah.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.906
And Olivia Metis is
like talking,

16:48.007 --> 16:49.908
you know, being annoying,
and Cambie goes

16:50.009 --> 16:53.245
- "Olivia, be fucking quiet."
- No.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.247
And we're all like, "Oh shit.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.149
Like this is real deal,
no joke."

16:57.216 --> 17:00.085
It's just so...
It's so fucked.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.254
I can't stop hearing
the sound of it.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.428
So last night,
I was like, "Okay,

17:09.528 --> 17:11.230
why did I survive?

17:11.330 --> 17:13.499
Like out of everyone,
like why me?

17:13.565 --> 17:16.168
Is it so that
I can do something

17:16.235 --> 17:18.904
to like make this
never happen again?"

17:19.538 --> 17:20.672
Hmm.

17:20.739 --> 17:22.508
So, I set up this Zoom
with Everytown

17:22.574 --> 17:24.276
and we're gonna talk
about like

17:24.376 --> 17:26.278
how to be more reactive,
how to start a movement,

17:26.378 --> 17:27.746
how to get
a fuckin' bill passed.

17:27.846 --> 17:28.914
Like something.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.922
Why do you think he did it?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.960
I don't know,
is there like ever a reason?

17:46.565 --> 17:48.367
<i>After initial reports</i>
<i>of a shooter,</i>

17:48.434 --> 17:49.902
<i>officers surrounded</i>
<i>the campus,</i>

17:49.968 --> 17:51.737
<i>directing the evacuation</i>
<i>of hundreds</i>

17:51.804 --> 17:53.372
<i>of students from the scene.</i>

17:53.439 --> 17:54.606
<i>This tragedy is.</i>

17:54.706 --> 17:56.742
I think Anderson Cooper
is cute.

17:56.809 --> 17:57.976
<i> We've been</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

17:58.077 --> 17:59.945
He is. Don't get too attached.

18:34.813 --> 18:36.515
<i>Disturbing videos</i>
<i>from the students' cellphones</i>

18:41.587 --> 18:44.523
<i>In the video, gunshots can be</i>
<i>heard in the hall,</i>

18:44.623 --> 18:47.593
<i>answered by children screaming</i>
<i>in their classrooms...</i>

18:47.659 --> 18:49.294
I'm gonna go to Nick's.

18:49.361 --> 18:50.863
Uh, okay.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.464
<i>...during the escape,</i>
<i>children fled the building.</i>

19:29.001 --> 19:30.068
Hey.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.170
Hey.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.839
Wanna come in?

19:39.011 --> 19:39.912
Thank you.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.484
Want some water or somethin'?

19:47.085 --> 19:48.353
Okay.

19:53.892 --> 19:56.762
You have a really nice house.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.330
Thanks.

19:58.397 --> 20:01.500
Really nice, it's a cool vibe,
with the wood and uh...

20:01.567 --> 20:04.269
You have a lot
of cool art here, too.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.172
Yeah, uh, my dads
are artists, so...

20:07.239 --> 20:09.875
- Your parents are artists?
- Yeah.

20:11.510 --> 20:12.878
That is so cool.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.781
It all makes sense now.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.683
Do you know
when they'll be back?

20:18.750 --> 20:21.019
I'm actually not really sure.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.088
Yeah, they're gone
like all the time.

20:27.192 --> 20:30.462
Uh, I have to be honest
with you,

20:30.562 --> 20:32.097
'cause if I'm not then

20:32.197 --> 20:34.233
I'll probably feel really bad
about it.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.568
But I watched some of...
Thank you.

20:36.635 --> 20:40.105
Some of your dance videos
on Instagram.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.609
In the videos, you come off
like, so like hard.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.410
And whatever.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.546
What I'm tryin' to say
is you're a completely
different person

20:47.613 --> 20:49.982
when you're dancing
and in real life,

20:50.082 --> 20:51.283
you're like so different.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.385
Yeah, I don't know why
I'm like that.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.487
It's like... Yeah.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.924
It's cool though that you're
able to like just switch into

20:58.991 --> 21:00.259
a different mode.

21:00.325 --> 21:01.493
Like I could never
do something like that.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.761
It's dope.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.499
Thank you.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.435
Yeah.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.408
Is that...
Is that wine okay for you?

21:16.475 --> 21:18.010
Oh, yeah, no, it's so good.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.678
Are you sure?
I have like
a couple of others--

21:19.778 --> 21:20.979
No, it's... Yeah...

21:21.079 --> 21:23.849
That's like the best one
I've ever had, so.

21:23.949 --> 21:24.983
Okay.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.858
- I'm sorry, I'm gonna--
- Oh.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.327
I'll turn this off,
my mom keeps
checking in on me.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.129
Okay.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.365
Nick told me that

21:40.465 --> 21:43.502
Quinton's brother's service
is tomorrow.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.304
Already? That's--

21:45.370 --> 21:46.972
- Yeah, I--
- That's great.

21:47.039 --> 21:51.109
I guess some religions
do them fast.

21:51.176 --> 21:52.377
I was thinkin' about going.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.645
Do you think
that would be weird?

21:53.712 --> 21:56.048
No. No, I don't...
I don't think so.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.518
Okay.

21:59.618 --> 22:03.121
I mean, I can,
like, come with you
if you want.

22:03.188 --> 22:04.656
Yeah, no, I--

22:04.723 --> 22:07.392
- Yeah, I want... Yeah.
- Yeah, if you...

22:07.492 --> 22:10.295
Um, yeah.
If that's cool with you, so...

22:11.563 --> 22:14.032
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Cool.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.971
Can I ask you a question?

22:20.038 --> 22:21.006
Mmm-hmm.

22:25.644 --> 22:27.412
Did you have like

22:27.512 --> 22:29.481
the craziest nightmares
last night?

22:31.550 --> 22:34.219
You have to be able to sleep
to have nightmares.

22:54.172 --> 22:55.273
Hey.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.441
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.211
Uh, thank you for coming.

23:00.445 --> 23:01.413
Of course.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.553
Do you wanna go to Starbucks?

24:48.653 --> 24:49.621
No.

24:50.388 --> 24:52.057
Do you want a Starbucks?

24:52.791 --> 24:54.292
Mmm, no.

24:55.894 --> 24:56.828
Okay.

25:05.737 --> 25:08.907
I'm literally gonna
make Mom get me something
with caffeine .

25:27.526 --> 25:30.695
<i>I only do that when I play</i>
<i>with my little dinosaur.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:34.266
<i>Do the cat pitch.</i>

25:34.366 --> 25:36.401
<i>Never again.</i>

25:39.437 --> 25:41.773
<i>I only do that when I play</i>
<i>with my little dinosaur.</i>

25:43.775 --> 25:45.277
<i>Do the cat pitch.</i>

25:46.611 --> 25:47.779
Never again.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.219
Are you hungry?

26:00.458 --> 26:02.761
- That's really good.
- Mmm.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.462
I'm spilling it everywhere.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.365
It is really good.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.636
Are your dads really chill?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.109
They travel a lot though, huh?

26:18.209 --> 26:19.444
Mostly, Europe.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.413
For like fun?

26:22.647 --> 26:24.149
Work.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.784
Do they send people
to spy on you

26:25.884 --> 26:29.087
or they trust you just to not
throw a bunch of ragers.

26:30.922 --> 26:35.927
I mean, they know I'm not
like a rager person, so.

26:37.395 --> 26:38.797
Who do you hang out
with at school?

26:39.931 --> 26:40.899
Like...

26:42.267 --> 26:44.302
Like different people.

26:45.470 --> 26:47.172
Like a bunch
of different people, so.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.809
I'm gone a lot with dance.

26:51.643 --> 26:52.978
How often do you dance?

26:53.778 --> 26:55.480
Every day.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.815
Like classes?

26:56.915 --> 26:58.083
Mmm-hmm.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.320
But I haven't gone

27:02.420 --> 27:05.156
since the thing.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.832
Are your parents chill?

27:16.334 --> 27:19.037
My dad more than my mom,
for sure.

27:19.137 --> 27:22.474
- My mom's like
very white and anxious.

27:24.209 --> 27:26.344
I don't really tell 'em
anything though, 'cause like

27:27.012 --> 27:28.113
they worry.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.818
I feel kinda bad for it.
They're actually
really good parents.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.659
<i> I see you're packing</i>
<i>for a trip.</i>

27:40.725 --> 27:41.993
<i>What's your favorite</i>
<i>country to visit?</i>

27:42.060 --> 27:43.294
<i>Paris.</i>

27:43.361 --> 27:45.063
What's the last country
you visited?

27:45.163 --> 27:46.498
<i>Europe.</i>

27:46.564 --> 27:48.066
<i> What country</i>
<i>do you wish to visit?</i>

27:48.166 --> 27:49.300
<i> Persia.</i>

27:51.136 --> 27:53.571
<i> What's the weirdest word</i>
<i>in the English language?</i>

27:53.672 --> 27:55.974
<i> Moist. Yuck.</i>

27:56.041 --> 27:57.409
<i> When was</i>
<i>the last time you cried?</i>

28:01.146 --> 28:02.414
Can you stay?

28:05.517 --> 28:06.718
It's late.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.354
Just till I fall asleep.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.859
Okay.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.928
Thanks.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.069
<i> What's your</i>
<i>favorite movie?</i>

28:24.169 --> 28:25.103
<i> Mmm, Pizza.</i>

28:25.203 --> 28:27.038
<i> Favorite TV show?</i>

28:27.105 --> 28:29.240
<i> Um, I would have</i>
<i>to say my pilot</i>
<i>with Kate Berlant</i>

28:29.340 --> 28:31.209
<i>that was passed on</i>
<i>by every major network</i>
<i>and streaming platform.</i>

28:31.276 --> 28:33.378
<i>Meanwhile, rapists everywhere</i>
<i>continue to freely make up 10.</i>

28:33.445 --> 28:34.713
<i> What up, bitch?</i>

28:34.779 --> 28:36.948
Dude, I'm so sorry I missed
the march.

28:37.048 --> 28:40.218
I mean, it's fine.
I was just, like,
legit worried about you.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.087
<i>It was cool, though.</i>
<i>They let me speak.</i>

28:42.187 --> 28:44.956
I wish you'd been there,
but it's fine,
I'll send you a link.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.592
I know, I'm sorry.
I just...

28:47.692 --> 28:50.295
It's a long story,
but I ended up goin' to
Mia's house and--

28:50.395 --> 28:52.263
Wait, lol, Mia Reed?

28:52.797 --> 28:54.265
What?

28:54.365 --> 28:55.700
<i> Yeah.</i>

28:55.767 --> 29:00.071
She... She's just been alone
and I feel bad.

29:00.138 --> 29:04.109
- So I just--
- No, no, no, I mean, it's fine.
It's just like random.

29:04.209 --> 29:05.376
Is she okay?

29:05.443 --> 29:06.911
<i> I mean, she will be.</i>

29:08.580 --> 29:10.115
Are you okay?

29:10.215 --> 29:11.149
Yeah.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.218
Just tired.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.923
<i> We wanna</i>
<i>know how a 16-year-old</i>
<i>can have access</i>

29:18.990 --> 29:22.327
<i>to a military assault rifle</i>
<i>and that's considered okay?</i>

29:22.427 --> 29:24.329
<i>- It's not okay!</i>

29:24.429 --> 29:26.231
<i>We want change.</i>

29:26.297 --> 29:29.400
<i>We deserve to feel safe</i>
<i>going to our own school</i>
<i>every day...</i>

29:52.924 --> 29:55.860
It feels like so soon.
It's been like two weeks.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.295
<i> No, I hear you.</i>

29:57.362 --> 29:58.997
<i>It's... It's intense,</i>
<i>but I just...</i>

29:59.097 --> 30:01.766
<i>I don't want us to be ruled</i>
<i>by fear, you know?</i>

30:01.833 --> 30:03.668
<i>I feel like it'll be less scary</i>
<i>if we were together.</i>

30:03.768 --> 30:04.936
I gotta go.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.004
Okay, love you. Call me later.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.539
Hey! Honey, can I come in?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.841
You don't have to ask
to come in, Mom.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.377
Okay.

30:12.477 --> 30:16.481
So it sounds like Nick's going
back today, huh?

30:16.548 --> 30:19.717
Yup. He is.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.719
Well...

30:21.820 --> 30:23.688
Well, as long
as you wanna stay home,

30:23.788 --> 30:28.059
you know,
your dad and I support that.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.127
Thank you.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.733
There's just one thing.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.209
Were you tired a lot
before the incident?

30:47.078 --> 30:48.580
LOL.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.350
You called it "the incident".

30:52.417 --> 30:54.686
Um...

30:54.752 --> 30:57.388
No, I guess I'm just
always tired.

30:57.488 --> 30:59.657
I mean, I guess, that's what
caffeine is for.

30:59.724 --> 31:00.925
Right?

31:02.193 --> 31:04.929
What do you do
when you get tired?

31:05.029 --> 31:07.498
Sleep for like
14 hours straight.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.868
Ooh, I really like watching
early seasons

31:09.934 --> 31:11.002
of the<i> Kardashians.</i>

31:11.069 --> 31:12.837
The OG Hidden Hills shit.

31:14.239 --> 31:15.940
That is my vibe!

31:23.214 --> 31:26.284
What's this, you're just
gonna fax that
to my mom or...

31:26.384 --> 31:28.720
- Fax?
- Yes. Fax.

31:28.786 --> 31:31.256
What are you, a time traveler
from the '80s?

31:32.924 --> 31:36.394
I mean,
I had my suspicions when
I saw those sneakers,

31:36.461 --> 31:38.963
but now I'm pretty convinced.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.865
Touche.

31:40.932 --> 31:42.901
Touche.

31:42.967 --> 31:46.571
Look, I know this whole
therapy thing is weird

31:46.638 --> 31:48.072
and can be uncomfortable.

31:48.139 --> 31:50.208
But everything that you say
in here is confidential.

31:50.275 --> 31:53.211
And, side note, I actually do
really like your shoes.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.113
They're very cool.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.782
No, I know. Thank you.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.386
Are there things that you don't
feel comfortable talking

32:01.452 --> 32:05.123
to your parents about
that maybe you wanna
share with me?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.163
Yeah.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.167
My porn addiction.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.102
Okay.

32:20.338 --> 32:21.639
I'm so sorry. I'm...

32:21.739 --> 32:23.241
When I get nervous,

32:23.308 --> 32:25.510
I make really inappropriate
jokes, so, my bad.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.645
You don't have to be sorry.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.414
And you don't
have to be nervous.

32:30.982 --> 32:34.419
Well, I know that my parents
are worried about me

32:34.485 --> 32:36.754
and they think I need help.

32:36.821 --> 32:39.624
But I get it,
and that's fine,

32:39.691 --> 32:42.193
but I personally am fine.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.930
Like I feel like
I'm really good
at managing my emotions.

32:45.997 --> 32:47.031
It's...

32:48.299 --> 32:49.834
What do you mean by that?

32:51.502 --> 32:53.705
I'm just very chill.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.873
Like a very low-key person.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.644
So when it comes
to emotional stuff
or drama I'm like

32:59.711 --> 33:03.014
"Okay, is this
really productive?"

33:04.482 --> 33:06.617
Yeah. I get it.

33:06.684 --> 33:08.820
But you know, just because--

33:08.886 --> 33:12.323
It doesn't necessarily mean
that someone's
being dramatic

33:12.390 --> 33:14.726
because they're emotional.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.194
You know, for a lot of people,

33:16.294 --> 33:17.795
they need to fully experience
their emotions,

33:17.862 --> 33:20.131
in order to process
what they've been through,

33:20.198 --> 33:22.400
so that they can begin to heal.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.169
It's actually really healthy
to show your emotion.

33:33.411 --> 33:34.746
I know most people
come in here crying

33:34.846 --> 33:36.414
about their cheating husbands.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.483
Vada, I wanna talk about you.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.086
I wanna know
how that shooting
at your school

33:42.186 --> 33:43.554
has made you feel.

33:47.925 --> 33:49.727
I feel...

33:55.700 --> 33:57.769
It's okay.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.203
I mean, it makes sense.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.076
I want you to track
how you're feeling

34:05.176 --> 34:07.378
using this worksheet.

34:07.445 --> 34:09.280
So there's questions on there
that'll guide you.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.782
You don't have to overthink it,

34:10.882 --> 34:12.683
it's just basically there to
hold space for you to...

34:12.750 --> 34:16.220
To understand whatever
emotions may come up.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.524
All you have to do
is try and feel.

34:19.590 --> 34:20.725
That's it.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.860
No matter what
those feelings are.

34:22.927 --> 34:26.197
Then you can bring it back
next session and we'll
go through it.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.065
Or you know,
you can fax it to me!

34:28.132 --> 34:29.300
If that's easier for you.

34:33.071 --> 34:37.575
She said
you were incredibly bright,
and smart, and funny.

34:37.642 --> 34:39.944
Wait,
is she in love with me?

34:40.044 --> 34:41.813
Oh, what's the point of
goin' to therapy,

34:41.913 --> 34:43.981
if they're just gonna tell
their parents everything
they said after?

34:44.081 --> 34:45.716
Honey, she didn't
tell me anything.

34:45.783 --> 34:47.985
She gave me
a general assessment
of how the session went.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.054
- That's all.
- She thought
you were doing really well,

34:50.121 --> 34:51.489
considering what you
went through.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.324
- Excuse me?
- Amelia!

34:53.424 --> 34:56.727
She was on speakerphone.
It's not like I was
trying to listen.

34:56.794 --> 34:57.895
I'm sorry.

34:57.962 --> 34:59.764
Whatever. Do I need
to go again?

34:59.831 --> 35:01.933
Because it sounds like
she thinks everything is fine.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.634
Well,
I don't know, honey.

35:03.734 --> 35:06.304
I mean, do you think you're
ready to go back to school?

35:10.108 --> 35:11.576
- Aren't you coming with us?
- No.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.010
Well, I don't know
what you want.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.846
- I don't know, turkey.
- Toasted?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.647
I don't care, Mom!

37:10.361 --> 37:12.863
<i>We won't live our lives scared</i>
<i>to go to school every day.</i>

37:12.930 --> 37:15.299
<i>We can't accept a world</i>
<i>in which the federal government</i>

37:15.399 --> 37:17.535
<i>thinks American</i>
<i>high school students</i>
<i>getting gunned down</i>

37:17.602 --> 37:19.904
<i>in their classrooms</i>
<i>isn't a priority.</i>

37:19.971 --> 37:23.140
<i>We won't accept</i>
<i>that our leaders have NRA money</i>
<i>in their pockets</i>

37:23.241 --> 37:25.443
<i>and our blood</i>
<i>on their hands.</i>

37:25.543 --> 37:27.111
<i>We want real change.</i>

37:27.211 --> 37:29.280
<i>We want real leadership,</i>
<i>honest politics that make</i>

37:29.380 --> 37:32.950
<i>our schools a safe place</i>
<i>for us to learn and grow.</i>

37:33.050 --> 37:34.485
<i>And we want it</i>
<i>before it's too late.</i>

37:34.585 --> 37:35.820
Can I have some wine?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.388
<i>That was Nick Feinstein,</i>

37:37.455 --> 37:38.756
<i>one of the several</i>
<i>surviving students.</i>

38:03.447 --> 38:05.082
Does it get stuck
on your fingers?

38:06.017 --> 38:07.652
Yeah.

38:07.752 --> 38:10.588
I don't know,
it's gonna be good, you know?

38:13.357 --> 38:15.626
- You just gotta get in it,
you know?
- Yeah, like that?

38:19.263 --> 38:21.098
- It's the shoulders.
- It's all in the shoulders.

38:21.165 --> 38:23.334
- Like you can't do it
without the shoulders.
- Okay, my bad.

38:26.103 --> 38:27.371
I feel like that felt right.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.307
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
- Like now it feels ready.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.275
- I think if you did it anymore,
it'd be overkill.
- Okay. Okay.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.151
Oh, where did it go?

38:41.686 --> 38:42.987
It wasn't enough.

38:43.054 --> 38:45.356
No, you definitely have to
grind it way more.

38:45.456 --> 38:46.824
I need more?

38:46.891 --> 38:48.959
Little more.

38:49.026 --> 38:52.496
Ooh, yeah.
Stoner vibes.

38:52.563 --> 38:53.731
It's gonna be good.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.166
- So good?
- So good.

38:55.232 --> 38:56.400
Can't wait?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.335
Can't wait.
Are you getting pumped?

38:57.401 --> 38:59.737
Go! Go! Go! Go!

38:59.837 --> 39:01.238
This is it.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.643
- Ooh.
- Look at us.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.878
- Who'd have thought?
- Who'd have thought?

39:07.978 --> 39:09.980
That is fat.

39:10.047 --> 39:11.816
Why do you trust me?

39:11.882 --> 39:14.985
'Cause you've smoked before.

39:15.052 --> 39:18.255
- Okay. Not like too much.
- It's so thick.

39:20.057 --> 39:22.393
Is it ever too much?

39:22.493 --> 39:25.396
- We'll find out.
- Stoner thoughts.

39:25.496 --> 39:27.865
- Hey, did you just say
"stoner thoughts"?
- Yes, I did!

39:32.002 --> 39:33.070
Oh!

39:34.905 --> 39:36.273
It's kinda thick.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.677
- Curvy queen.
So beautiful!
- She has curves.

39:39.744 --> 39:41.078
- Holy, how do I?--
- Do the honors.

39:41.178 --> 39:42.947
- No, just... Just... No.
- Do I--

39:43.047 --> 39:44.682
Is this cigarette
or is it like this?

39:44.749 --> 39:46.117
- Cigarette? Weed?
- You choose.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.752
- Weed? Cigarette? Weed?
- You choose. You choose.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.955
Wait, other--

39:51.055 --> 39:52.923
Oh!

39:54.759 --> 39:57.094
Okay. This is it.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.601
Yo, it has gotten
so bad though,
like so bad,

40:03.701 --> 40:06.237
to the point where they're
cutting the elephant tusks off

40:06.303 --> 40:07.471
before they release them,

40:07.571 --> 40:08.939
so like the poachers
can't kill them.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.741
So, it's like,
"Okay, they don't have tusks,

40:10.808 --> 40:12.877
but like at least,
they're alive." You know?

40:12.943 --> 40:15.045
It's so messed up!

40:15.112 --> 40:17.448
No, and then it makes me think
about the uh, what's his name?

40:17.548 --> 40:19.316
The Jimmy John's founder?

40:19.417 --> 40:21.285
Apparently, he's like
some trophy hunter.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.120
But the thing about that one is
like I don't know

40:23.220 --> 40:24.922
if I have the right to be mad
about that,

40:24.989 --> 40:26.457
'cause I don't know
if it's true or not.

40:26.557 --> 40:29.126
So every time I see it,
I'm like, "Is this real?

40:29.226 --> 40:30.461
Or is it like this fake news?"

40:30.561 --> 40:35.232
Like, "Can I trust this meme?"

40:35.299 --> 40:38.436
Can you be honest with me
for like 2.5 seconds?

40:38.502 --> 40:41.672
- Am I being annoying?

40:41.772 --> 40:43.174
Because personally for me,
I feel like this weed

40:43.274 --> 40:44.942
is making me
a little bit chatty.

40:45.009 --> 40:48.145
Like I don't even feel sad
at this point, I'm just chatty.

40:48.245 --> 40:50.481
I don't know, is that bad?
What about you,
what do you feel?

40:52.149 --> 40:53.984
I feel chill.

40:55.653 --> 40:57.521
You always feel chill.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.364
I feel nothing.

41:09.633 --> 41:12.036
- Fuck!

41:22.279 --> 41:24.782
- I hate weed.

41:31.856 --> 41:33.457
I hope that's not your dinner.

41:33.524 --> 41:34.892
Yup.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.293
Ew, Vada.

41:37.361 --> 41:39.063
Where's your sister?

41:39.163 --> 41:43.067
Um, filming a nighttime routine
for her YouTube channel.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.568
Don't ask.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.971
Do you think we should take her
phone away?

41:47.037 --> 41:50.374
No, but you should probably get
that app where you can see
everything she does online.

41:50.474 --> 41:52.510
That exists?
Who knew!

41:52.576 --> 41:55.746
Wow, where we'd be without you?

42:00.017 --> 42:04.755
So Vada, honey, I was um...

42:04.855 --> 42:06.490
I wanted to talk to you
about school.

42:10.394 --> 42:11.896
What's up?

42:11.996 --> 42:13.831
Well, I don't
want you to fall
too far behind.

42:13.898 --> 42:15.099
I won't.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.600
Well,
you can't stay home forever.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.537
Why not?

42:19.603 --> 42:22.006
Sure, I just think that
the longer you stay home,

42:22.072 --> 42:26.210
the harder it's gonna be
for you to go back.

42:26.744 --> 42:28.712
All...

42:28.779 --> 42:31.515
All I want is what's best
for you.

42:31.582 --> 42:34.184
I wanna see that sparkle back.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.592
You know,
Amelia got her period.

42:42.293 --> 42:43.394
What?

42:45.229 --> 42:47.064
- When?
- Forever ago.

42:47.131 --> 42:49.366
Guess she just didn't
want you to know.

42:59.777 --> 43:02.313
My mom's tryin' to make me go
back to school.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.649
<i>Fuck.</i>

43:05.749 --> 43:07.084
When are you gonna go back?

43:09.053 --> 43:10.588
<i>I don't know.</i>

43:10.654 --> 43:12.623
My dads said I could
do homeschooling
as long as I want.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.226
Lucky you.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.132
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

43:22.232 --> 43:23.434
<i>Goodnight.</i>

43:25.402 --> 43:26.337
Night!

43:45.522 --> 43:48.826
Get out of the building and far
away from it as you can.

43:48.926 --> 43:50.828
Next, you need to find...

44:01.672 --> 44:03.474
Always remember
these three things.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.874
That should
be enough for today.

44:36.974 --> 44:39.643
You can basically just review
your notes for the test.

44:39.710 --> 44:42.980
Again, if I've talked about it,
it'll be on the test.

44:43.047 --> 44:44.415
And guys, remember, I said,

44:44.515 --> 44:45.916
"No phones
during classes, please."

45:12.042 --> 45:13.110
Shit.

45:14.111 --> 45:17.081
Oh, you bitch.

45:18.615 --> 45:21.118
You dumb fucking bitch.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.256
It was a fucking soda can!

45:29.259 --> 45:30.928
Dumb fucking stupid--

45:31.028 --> 45:33.697
So today at PE,
Jack Booth was whopping
the beanbag

45:33.764 --> 45:36.066
and one hit me in the forearm,
and the PE teacher saw it,

45:36.133 --> 45:37.735
and didn't say one word.

45:37.801 --> 45:39.436
And I was like, "Okay, you're
terrible at about your job."

45:39.536 --> 45:41.805
I'm sure he's not terrible
at his job, Amelia.

45:41.905 --> 45:44.074
Dad, he's protected
by union and tenure.

45:44.141 --> 45:46.810
That's the only reason
he's still there.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.312
How about you, Vada?
How was...

45:48.412 --> 45:49.613
How was your first day back?

45:53.217 --> 45:55.586
Just low-key.

45:55.652 --> 45:58.255
So, is everyone
settling in okay?

45:58.322 --> 46:01.892
I don't know,
it's... It's heavy,
but I think everybody's

46:01.959 --> 46:03.727
just tryin' to move on.

46:03.794 --> 46:07.431
Good. That's good.
I'm so glad.

46:07.498 --> 46:10.167
Yeah, it's amazing.

46:10.267 --> 46:11.802
Ugh, I'm so full.

46:11.902 --> 46:12.836
Finish your salad.

46:14.238 --> 46:15.472
It's wilted.

46:15.572 --> 46:17.274
It's good for you.
Finish it.

46:17.341 --> 46:20.577
I just
can't do arugula, Dad.
It's the texture!

46:32.322 --> 46:33.290
Hey.

46:35.192 --> 46:37.027
Uh, hey.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.197
Do you have any E?

46:40.964 --> 46:43.200
Uh, what?

46:47.871 --> 46:49.273
How much do you want?

48:10.721 --> 48:12.222
There's gonna be
a quiz, okay? Um...

48:14.424 --> 48:16.927
May I go to the restroom?

48:17.027 --> 48:18.061
Sure.

48:20.264 --> 48:22.232
Okay,
so make sure that you
are studying.

48:22.299 --> 48:23.800
You have to know the difference

48:23.901 --> 48:26.637
I'm not gonna help you on this
when you have a pop...

48:26.737 --> 48:29.907
quiz for this on Friday.

48:53.130 --> 48:54.765
- Nick.

49:42.012 --> 49:43.613
Vada, Vada!

49:43.680 --> 49:44.881
Oh my God, Vada! Hey!

49:44.982 --> 49:46.883
Hey, hey, hey!
Vada, what'd you take?

49:46.984 --> 49:49.052
I hate it here.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.655
Vada, what're you doing?
Hey, what'd you take?

49:51.722 --> 49:53.290
Hey, what's on your face?
Vada, come on!

49:53.357 --> 49:54.524
Spaghetti.

49:54.624 --> 49:55.726
No.

49:55.826 --> 49:56.893
Hey, you need
to get your shit together

49:56.994 --> 49:58.161
before someone sees you.
Come on!

49:58.228 --> 50:00.530
Ready? We're going.
We're going!

50:00.630 --> 50:02.733
We're going, okay.

50:05.669 --> 50:07.537
Is it at least a good high?

50:11.375 --> 50:13.744
Is that an elbow?

50:18.515 --> 50:20.183
Why's your mouth
all blue?

50:20.250 --> 50:22.652
Jesus, Millie,
what do you want?

50:24.421 --> 50:26.156
A pen exploded in my mouth.

50:26.223 --> 50:27.824
Oh, that happened
to me once, too,

50:27.891 --> 50:28.992
but like it was a marker.

50:29.059 --> 50:30.260
Good story, what do you want?

50:31.695 --> 50:33.196
Nothing.

50:52.749 --> 50:54.117
Mmm.

50:59.856 --> 51:01.858
Ugh.

51:09.766 --> 51:11.568
Motherfucker.

51:12.869 --> 51:13.970
Shit.

51:18.875 --> 51:22.279
<i> Oh,</i>
<i>okay, so I guess</i>
<i>you weren't playing.</i>

51:22.379 --> 51:23.780
What does that mean?

51:23.880 --> 51:25.782
<i>Let me read you this text.</i>

51:25.882 --> 51:29.152
<i>"Uh, Q, I did drugs,"</i>
<i>with a Z, by the way.</i>

51:29.252 --> 51:31.555
<i>That was the Z</i>
<i>on the drugs.</i>

51:31.621 --> 51:34.724
<i>Uh, "And I'm YOLOing hard.</i>
<i>Hit me up, honey.</i>

51:34.791 --> 51:36.326
<i>Let's party."</i>

51:36.426 --> 51:40.664
<i>And then you did this emoji,</i>
<i>and then this emoji,</i>

51:40.764 --> 51:42.265
<i>and then a hockey stick.</i>

51:42.332 --> 51:44.734
<i>You just spammed, uh,</i>
<i>spammed emojis.</i>

51:44.801 --> 51:46.269
No, I did not.

51:46.336 --> 51:48.171
<i> Yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, you did.</i>

51:48.271 --> 51:50.474
<i>But uh, now why'd</i>
<i>you do the drugs,</i>
<i>uh, with the Z?</i>

51:50.574 --> 51:55.812
Dude, I literally don't know,
so what had happened was...

51:55.912 --> 51:58.014
Is, um...

51:58.115 --> 52:02.652
I was walking
past Dan Bonavure,
and I was like, "Okay,

52:02.752 --> 52:05.655
I know he's a dealer.
I know he has E.

52:05.755 --> 52:07.524
I'm gonna take some like
right now."

52:07.624 --> 52:09.426
<i>Oh shit, okay.</i>
<i>Uh, and how're...</i>

52:09.493 --> 52:11.595
<i>How're you feelin' now?</i>

52:11.661 --> 52:13.330
To be determined.

52:13.430 --> 52:16.099
<i>Well, I'm here if you need me.</i>

52:16.166 --> 52:17.334
Um...

52:18.869 --> 52:21.171
What are you doing later?

52:21.271 --> 52:23.507
'Cause I was just
gonna be low-key

52:23.607 --> 52:24.608
and like watch a movie
or something.

52:24.674 --> 52:25.775
You should come by.

52:25.842 --> 52:28.145
<i>Okay. And I'll</i>
<i>bring the acid.</i>

52:28.211 --> 52:29.112
Goodbye.

52:34.818 --> 52:36.786
<i> So is he</i>
<i>your boyfriend?</i>

52:36.853 --> 52:38.121
What are you making?

52:38.188 --> 52:40.657
Slime. And don't
avoid the question.

52:40.724 --> 52:42.192
This is way too juicy.

52:42.292 --> 52:43.994
You've literally never
had a boy over

52:44.060 --> 52:45.462
that was straight before.

52:45.529 --> 52:46.963
Oh, sorry, sorry.

52:47.030 --> 52:48.665
I shouldn't assume
his sexual orientation.

52:48.732 --> 52:50.400
So like how does he identify?

52:50.500 --> 52:52.302
You're asking
way too many questions.

52:52.369 --> 52:55.405
Vada, you are gonna stay
in the living room, right?

52:55.505 --> 52:57.741
No, I was thinking
we're gonna snuggle
in the dark in my room.

52:57.841 --> 52:58.909
Yes, Mom!

52:59.009 --> 53:00.744
I was just asking.

53:02.412 --> 53:04.247
Please don't embarrass me.

53:04.347 --> 53:07.384
I'm serious, Amelia.
Oh my God.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.821
No!
No, no, no, don't go
in the river!

53:11.888 --> 53:13.657
- Why is he going in the river?
- I don't know.

53:13.723 --> 53:16.193
This is the saddest shit
I have ever seen in my life.

53:16.259 --> 53:17.761
This is terrible!

53:17.861 --> 53:20.430
This is so bad!
Why would they
let kids watch this?

53:20.530 --> 53:22.199
Yeah, you said
you wanted to watch this.

53:22.265 --> 53:23.767
- I cannot... You picked this.
- You said this was your fa--

53:23.867 --> 53:25.669
I gave you options.
I gave you options--

53:25.735 --> 53:27.037
- Come on.
- And you chose this one.

53:27.103 --> 53:27.737
What are you guys
laughing at?

53:30.874 --> 53:31.675
Amelia!

53:31.741 --> 53:33.510
Sorry, sorry!

53:33.577 --> 53:35.779
I just wanted to let you guys
know that the slime
is almost ready.

53:35.879 --> 53:37.280
If you wanna try it,
I'll allow it.

53:37.380 --> 53:38.848
I love slime. I wanna try.

53:38.915 --> 53:40.417
Okay! Do you want blue or red?

53:40.517 --> 53:41.618
Blue, please.

53:41.718 --> 53:43.286
Vada?

53:43.386 --> 53:46.189
I don't...
Red. I don't care.

53:46.256 --> 53:47.591
Coming right up!

53:50.093 --> 53:51.528
I am so sorry.

53:51.595 --> 53:53.363
She's so cute.

53:53.430 --> 53:55.065
Do you wanna watch
<i>The Staircase?</i>

53:55.131 --> 53:56.800
- Do you know what that is?
- No, what's<i> The Staircase?</i>

53:56.900 --> 53:58.768
It's this white guy,
who murders
his second wife,

53:58.868 --> 54:01.404
and probably his first wife,
and gets away with both.

54:01.471 --> 54:03.473
Oh, a tale as old as time.

54:03.573 --> 54:04.808
Tale as old as time, really?

54:04.908 --> 54:06.309
Yeah.

54:06.409 --> 54:08.144
Wait, no, have you seen
the memes of like you know,

54:08.245 --> 54:10.080
all these women are obsessed
with these murder docs,

54:10.146 --> 54:12.449
people have
like taken these photos
of the Stepford Wives

54:12.549 --> 54:14.150
you know, with the smile,
with the knife?

54:14.251 --> 54:15.585
- It's like--
- Nah, I haven't seen--

54:15.652 --> 54:17.621
Uh, and it says,
"Murder me, Daddy."

54:17.721 --> 54:18.722
Nah, I haven't seen that.

54:18.788 --> 54:20.090
You've never seen that?

54:20.156 --> 54:22.926
It's everywhere.
Check your timeline, dude.

54:24.794 --> 54:26.263
It's really funny.

54:30.967 --> 54:32.269
Everything okay?

54:34.738 --> 54:36.239
Is everything alright?

54:36.306 --> 54:38.441
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.

54:38.508 --> 54:40.443
I just have to go home
right now.

54:42.112 --> 54:44.314
I'm sorry, but you know, uh,
family stuff.

54:44.414 --> 54:47.817
Yeah, don't even apologize.
That's totally fine.

54:49.819 --> 54:52.689
Yeah, um, honestly,
I just can't believe that

54:52.789 --> 54:56.192
you're gonna leave alone
to watch this cat flow down
the river all by myself.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.627
Oh, you're actually
gonna finish it?

54:57.694 --> 54:59.262
I have to!
I have to see what happens!

54:59.329 --> 55:03.633
Okay, well, uh, text me
and let me know,

55:03.700 --> 55:04.634
you know, what happens.

55:08.038 --> 55:10.440
I hope everything's okay
at home.

55:10.507 --> 55:12.175
You know how it is.

55:12.709 --> 55:13.943
Yeah.

55:14.944 --> 55:16.713
I'll see you.

55:35.198 --> 55:37.567
No, no, no, no, no

55:37.667 --> 55:39.202
- You don't trust me?
- No!

55:39.302 --> 55:40.904
- You don't trust me?
- No, mom!

55:41.004 --> 55:42.639
- You don't trust me?
- Oh my God.

55:42.706 --> 55:44.074
- You don't trust me?
- Stop! Stop!

55:44.174 --> 55:45.342
No, now let me see
which one you have.

55:45.408 --> 55:46.543
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Stop!

55:47.177 --> 55:49.079
Stop.

55:49.179 --> 55:50.380
- But this one, I heard
this would be better.
- That smells like strawberries.

55:50.480 --> 55:51.848
No, that's too--

55:51.915 --> 55:53.416
No, smell, smell.
Smell, smell. Smell.

55:53.516 --> 55:55.151
Oh! Ew!

55:55.218 --> 55:57.587
- Disgusting,
I know. Oh God!
- You're so bad.

56:00.523 --> 56:01.725
This one does
smell good, though.

56:01.825 --> 56:04.527
Just take a little sniff.
Come on.

56:09.032 --> 56:12.602
- Ow, Jesus!

56:13.536 --> 56:15.004
- V!
- What?

56:15.071 --> 56:17.173
- Let me in!
- No.

56:17.240 --> 56:19.209
You never
lock the door. What are
you doing in there?

56:19.275 --> 56:20.510
None of your business!

56:46.202 --> 56:48.271
Are you wearing my lipstick?

56:48.371 --> 56:49.973
What? No.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.275
Can you tell Mom
I don't need a ride?
Nick's gonna take me.

56:52.375 --> 56:54.911
Only if you tell me why you're
wearing my lipstick.

56:54.978 --> 56:58.415
I think those fake glasses
are messing with
your vision, dude.

56:58.481 --> 57:00.750
Well, you know, everyone wears
fake glasses now.

57:00.817 --> 57:02.419
It's socially acceptable!

57:04.120 --> 57:06.089
Okay, wait,
serious question.

57:06.156 --> 57:07.323
Okay.

57:07.424 --> 57:10.593
Now Drake?
<i>Degrassi</i> Drake? Choose.

57:11.494 --> 57:12.429
I like wheelchair Drake.

57:12.495 --> 57:14.731
Wheelchair Jimmy!

57:14.798 --> 57:16.833
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

57:18.067 --> 57:18.968
Jimmy!

57:25.275 --> 57:27.110
You're, like, yodeling.

57:27.177 --> 57:28.912
You probably
didn't know this about me,

57:28.978 --> 57:30.680
but I'm the best yodeler
in my family.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.915
Prove it!

57:31.981 --> 57:34.350
You can't put me
on the spot like that,

57:34.451 --> 57:35.685
'cause then that's just like,
you know...

57:35.785 --> 57:37.153
This is like
a little preview.

57:37.253 --> 57:38.955
- Yeah, this is like warm-up.
- Okay.

57:39.022 --> 57:41.324
You know, but I'm gonna get you
when you're not even ready.

57:41.424 --> 57:44.127
And you're gonna
be like...

57:46.262 --> 57:48.765
Hey, you know,
this might sound weird,

57:48.832 --> 57:52.101
'cause like I haven't known you
for that long,

57:52.168 --> 57:54.003
but, like, I feel
so comfortable with you.

57:54.103 --> 57:55.839
Like we're bonded
or something.

57:58.775 --> 57:59.776
Same.

58:05.215 --> 58:07.016
When'd you lose your virginity?

58:09.219 --> 58:10.620
I haven't.

58:10.687 --> 58:11.821
You haven't had sex?

58:11.888 --> 58:12.989
No.

58:13.056 --> 58:14.657
Do you mean
you haven't had today?

58:14.724 --> 58:18.228
- What?
- You dance like
such a fuck princess!

58:18.328 --> 58:19.662
What? No, I do not!

58:19.729 --> 58:21.331
- Yes, you do!
- What does that even mean?

58:21.397 --> 58:23.233
It means exactly what it sounds
like it means!

58:23.333 --> 58:24.400
You know, th...
The fuck princess!

58:24.501 --> 58:26.135
- Nah. no.
- Okay, I get...

58:26.202 --> 58:27.370
Okay, that's on me.

58:27.470 --> 58:29.305
- Never assume.
- You never...

58:29.372 --> 58:31.207
Wait, like, have you?

58:34.677 --> 58:35.845
What?

58:35.912 --> 58:37.714
Obviously not!

58:38.414 --> 58:42.752
I am so awkward

58:42.852 --> 58:44.487
and like embarra...
Like, no!

58:45.188 --> 58:47.357
Like, oh my God!

58:47.423 --> 58:48.691
I will say this.

58:48.758 --> 58:51.227
I feel like high school sex
is very '90s.

58:51.327 --> 58:52.428
Okay.

58:52.529 --> 58:56.900
And waiting until college
is more now.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.936
I mean, I feel like
I'm probably gonna wait
until I'm like in love.

59:02.505 --> 59:03.940
Oh.

59:04.941 --> 59:07.944
Oh, that's really sweet.

59:08.044 --> 59:11.848
Or when you go on tour with
Drake one day.

59:13.283 --> 59:14.350
You just let him have it.

59:16.586 --> 59:18.588
What's wheelchair Jimmy
like in bed?

1:00:25.788 --> 1:00:27.757
What are you
thinkin' about?

1:00:28.424 --> 1:00:29.859
Hmm?

1:00:44.374 --> 1:00:47.644
Okay, I know
you're a woman
of very little words,

1:00:49.145 --> 1:00:52.649
but I know you got
some deep shit happening

1:00:52.715 --> 1:00:56.152
- in this nice little head
of yours.

1:00:57.487 --> 1:00:59.689
Beep.

1:01:00.390 --> 1:01:02.859
God.

1:01:02.959 --> 1:01:04.293
Anything?

1:01:06.129 --> 1:01:08.498
Okay.

1:01:08.564 --> 1:01:13.069
Let's say this.
Let's say you die tomorrow.

1:01:13.169 --> 1:01:15.038
Okay?

1:01:15.138 --> 1:01:18.408
And what if you die sad,
'cause you regret not saying
what you wanted to say?

1:01:20.843 --> 1:01:22.078
Then what?

1:01:31.421 --> 1:01:33.056
I can't say it.

1:01:33.156 --> 1:01:34.590
Why?

1:02:08.925 --> 1:02:11.027
Is this okay?

1:03:35.478 --> 1:03:36.712
Where have you been?

1:03:36.813 --> 1:03:38.681
We've been freaking out!

1:03:38.781 --> 1:03:40.216
I was at Nick's.

1:03:40.316 --> 1:03:43.286
Nick's been calling all morning
wondering where you are.

1:03:46.222 --> 1:03:47.890
Vada, your phone was dead.

1:03:47.990 --> 1:03:49.325
We didn't know
if something terrible
had happened to you or--

1:03:49.392 --> 1:03:52.962
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

1:03:53.029 --> 1:03:55.298
The perfect child
tells a fat one.

1:03:55.364 --> 1:03:57.233
She better lose screen time
for that one, Dad.

1:03:57.333 --> 1:03:59.001
Vada, come back here!

1:03:59.902 --> 1:04:01.170
Vada!

1:04:02.905 --> 1:04:04.707
I told you,
you don't have to know!

1:04:04.807 --> 1:04:06.509
- Vada
- Vada, don't be rude.

1:04:06.576 --> 1:04:08.744
Vada, what were you doing
last night?

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:11.214
Nothing, Jesus!

1:04:11.314 --> 1:04:12.915
Are you...
Are you seeing someone?

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:15.384
LOL, seeing someone. No!

1:04:15.484 --> 1:04:17.587
Uh, I'll do it...
I'll do it.

1:04:21.824 --> 1:04:23.693
If you're gonna be
spending the night

1:04:23.759 --> 1:04:24.894
at someone's house, Vada--

1:04:24.994 --> 1:04:28.064
I'm not
having sex, Mom!

1:04:28.164 --> 1:04:30.333
- Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1:04:30.399 --> 1:04:31.868
What are you doing?

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:40.443
Last night, I slept over
at my friend Mia's house

1:04:40.543 --> 1:04:42.678
- and I got drunk.
- You got drunk?

1:04:42.745 --> 1:04:45.348
Yeah, Mom, I got drunk.

1:04:45.414 --> 1:04:48.251
I am 16 years old
and I drink alcohol,

1:04:48.351 --> 1:04:50.686
and here's the thing,
I don't even like drinking.

1:04:50.753 --> 1:04:52.955
I was just tryin' to live
in the moment,

1:04:53.055 --> 1:04:56.259
and feel shit, and YOLO
or something, okay?

1:05:03.933 --> 1:05:07.870
Now if you excuse me,
I am hungover as shit

1:05:07.937 --> 1:05:09.805
and I'm gonna go barf
in the shower.

1:05:12.942 --> 1:05:14.410
Who's Mia?

1:05:14.477 --> 1:05:15.945
Who's Mia?

1:05:29.592 --> 1:05:31.127
I'm not even tryin' to be rude,
I'm just--

1:05:31.227 --> 1:05:33.129
I'm super busy
and I don't have the time.

1:05:33.229 --> 1:05:34.597
So.

1:05:35.598 --> 1:05:36.933
Okay.

1:05:40.903 --> 1:05:42.338
I'm sorry
I never called you back,

1:05:42.438 --> 1:05:45.074
but you didn't have
to get me in trouble, dude.

1:05:45.141 --> 1:05:47.076
Vada, I was just
worried about you.

1:05:47.143 --> 1:05:48.311
When I didn't hear back
from you,

1:05:48.411 --> 1:05:49.745
I felt like I had to call
your mom,

1:05:49.812 --> 1:05:51.147
'cause the last time
I had seen you,

1:05:51.247 --> 1:05:53.616
you had literally done drugs
at school.

1:05:53.683 --> 1:05:55.151
So I was like, "Okay, cool.

1:05:55.251 --> 1:05:58.187
Maybe she's like having
a serotonin drop from hell

1:05:58.287 --> 1:06:02.458
and she's like suicidal
on a bridge somewhere and...

1:06:02.525 --> 1:06:04.694
Then to hear like how freaked
your family was all night,

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:06.162
I just...

1:06:06.262 --> 1:06:08.030
I don't know, I hoped that

1:06:08.130 --> 1:06:10.199
whatever you went and did
was worth everything
you put them through.

1:06:10.299 --> 1:06:12.034
But, you know what?

1:06:12.134 --> 1:06:13.869
I'm guessing
uh, it's more likely you were
with Mia Reed somewhere,

1:06:13.970 --> 1:06:15.871
acting like nothing happened.

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:18.874
Why're you being like this?

1:06:18.975 --> 1:06:21.510
Because I've
waited for you, Vada.

1:06:21.610 --> 1:06:26.449
For a month,
I've given you space
and love to heal.

1:06:26.515 --> 1:06:28.384
But I've been dealing with this
my own way!

1:06:28.484 --> 1:06:31.554
You haven't
dealt with anything,
that's the problem!

1:06:31.654 --> 1:06:33.823
All I wanna do
is try my hardest
to stop this

1:06:33.889 --> 1:06:35.224
from ever happening again.

1:06:35.324 --> 1:06:39.462
Like why is that so hard
for you to understand?

1:06:39.528 --> 1:06:41.731
That's not fucking fair, Nick.

1:06:41.831 --> 1:06:44.066
None of this is fair, Vada.

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:50.473
Yeah, yeah.
Mmm-hmm, go be with Mia.

1:06:50.539 --> 1:06:52.875
She's gonna save the world
with her hot ass.

1:06:52.975 --> 1:06:54.243
Fuck you, Nick.

1:06:54.343 --> 1:06:55.244
Wow.

1:06:56.846 --> 1:06:58.080
Nice.

1:07:02.251 --> 1:07:04.253
He's just hurtin',
I think we all are.

1:07:04.353 --> 1:07:08.557
He was so cruel about it!

1:07:08.657 --> 1:07:11.427
Yeah, but you know,
he's under a lot of pressure.

1:07:11.527 --> 1:07:12.895
He has to be the face of this,

1:07:12.995 --> 1:07:17.433
just act brave, but, well,
he's scared, too.

1:07:17.533 --> 1:07:19.268
You know,
fear makes people act crazy.

1:07:21.704 --> 1:07:23.572
Okay, I...

1:07:23.672 --> 1:07:25.541
Like I'm sorry for like

1:07:25.608 --> 1:07:28.010
calling you and dumping
all of this on you,

1:07:28.077 --> 1:07:32.048
especially, because it's
been the hardest on you.

1:07:32.114 --> 1:07:33.682
It's hard on everyone.

1:07:37.353 --> 1:07:40.389
I think for me, you know,
when it hurts too much,

1:07:40.456 --> 1:07:44.560
I think about
how this can't be for nothing.

1:07:44.627 --> 1:07:46.695
Like, oh,
we won't even let this
be for not... Like, it...

1:07:46.762 --> 1:07:48.397
It can't be for nothing,
you know?

1:07:48.464 --> 1:07:50.699
Fuck. Yeah.

1:07:56.906 --> 1:07:58.274
Tell me about your brother.

1:08:03.279 --> 1:08:04.980
I just wanna know
more about him.

1:08:09.485 --> 1:08:12.888
He was, uh, real quiet

1:08:12.955 --> 1:08:14.290
when you first met him.

1:08:15.758 --> 1:08:18.394
He watched everything now,
you know.

1:08:18.461 --> 1:08:19.829
Like, he'd be like,

1:08:19.929 --> 1:08:21.497
"Oh, that girl is gonna go home
with that guy

1:08:21.597 --> 1:08:23.632
and that guy is gonna go home
with that girl and..."

1:08:23.732 --> 1:08:26.735
Like, he was always right.

1:08:26.802 --> 1:08:28.804
He was funny.

1:08:28.904 --> 1:08:31.640
Like always making me laugh.

1:08:36.278 --> 1:08:37.580
He, uh...

1:08:39.682 --> 1:08:41.317
He sounds dope.

1:08:47.423 --> 1:08:49.692
I feel him.

1:08:49.792 --> 1:08:53.696
Now I know this sounds crazy
to say like...

1:08:53.796 --> 1:08:57.133
I just...
I know he's still with me.

1:08:57.199 --> 1:08:59.201
He's not gonna let me
go back and be sad,

1:08:59.301 --> 1:09:02.538
he's not gonna
let me go forward
and freak out.

1:09:02.638 --> 1:09:05.474
He keeps me here.

1:09:05.541 --> 1:09:07.476
He keeps me calm.

1:09:10.346 --> 1:09:12.648
I think he's definitely
still here.

1:09:14.450 --> 1:09:16.619
Lot of people
don't ask me about him.

1:09:16.685 --> 1:09:20.789
They think I'mma like
cry or somethin'.

1:09:20.856 --> 1:09:24.226
Um, well, thank you.

1:09:29.365 --> 1:09:32.034
You can always talk
about him around me.

1:09:49.185 --> 1:09:51.420
Wait, wait.
I'm sorry, I...

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:53.756
What's wrong?

1:09:53.856 --> 1:09:57.026
I'm just going through a lot
right now, it's just...

1:09:57.092 --> 1:09:59.762
I just don't know
if I'm in the right headspace
right now.

1:10:02.264 --> 1:10:04.333
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:06.368
- I am so sorry!
- No, you're okay.

1:10:06.435 --> 1:10:08.170
I'm... No, of course, you are.
I'm so sorry.

1:10:08.237 --> 1:10:10.039
You're perfect, I like you,
it's just...

1:10:10.105 --> 1:10:11.373
- I'm so sorry.
- V, I swear, you didn't do
anything wrong.

1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:12.875
I am so sorry, okay?

1:10:12.942 --> 1:10:14.610
No, don't be sorry, it's...
It's not like that.

1:10:14.710 --> 1:10:15.911
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

1:10:48.711 --> 1:10:50.212
I can't sleep.

1:11:01.624 --> 1:11:04.793
You know, I can always see
where you are on Find A Friend

1:11:04.893 --> 1:11:06.795
when your phone isn't dead.

1:11:06.895 --> 1:11:09.231
You better delete me
off of that.

1:11:09.298 --> 1:11:10.599
Like tomorrow,

1:11:10.666 --> 1:11:12.501
so I don't tell Mom
about your Finsta.

1:11:12.601 --> 1:11:13.802
Fine!

1:11:15.604 --> 1:11:17.172
Why do you care where I am?

1:11:17.273 --> 1:11:18.440
I don't.

1:11:21.477 --> 1:11:24.246
You're always at a house
in North Bay.

1:11:24.313 --> 1:11:25.414
Why?

1:11:25.481 --> 1:11:27.650
It's where my friend Mia lives.

1:11:27.750 --> 1:11:28.917
Hmm.

1:11:37.259 --> 1:11:40.696
V, I'm scared.

1:11:40.796 --> 1:11:42.331
Of what?

1:11:45.034 --> 1:11:47.670
What if...

1:11:53.142 --> 1:11:56.478
What if a shooter comes
to my school next?

1:11:58.113 --> 1:11:59.882
It won't happen.

1:11:59.982 --> 1:12:01.483
How do you know?

1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:13.796
Sorry, I almost got you
killed in a shooting.

1:12:20.235 --> 1:12:21.970
What're you talking about?

1:12:22.037 --> 1:12:24.373
If I hadn't texted you
about my stupid period,

1:12:24.473 --> 1:12:26.675
you wouldn't have
left the classroom.

1:12:26.742 --> 1:12:29.311
You would've been safe.

1:12:29.378 --> 1:12:31.814
- You could've died.
- That's not true.

1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:33.215
Yes, it is!

1:12:33.315 --> 1:12:34.483
Quinton's brother died,
'cause he was walking

1:12:34.550 --> 1:12:36.218
in the same hallway.

1:12:39.822 --> 1:12:42.257
It wasn't safe anywhere

1:12:42.358 --> 1:12:44.093
Definitely wasn't your fault.

1:12:44.193 --> 1:12:48.530
Then why have you been
so mad at me?

1:12:48.597 --> 1:12:51.200
I haven't been mad at you.

1:12:51.266 --> 1:12:52.868
Why do you keep thinking that?

1:12:52.935 --> 1:12:54.770
Because...

1:12:55.871 --> 1:12:58.507
You're never home anymore.

1:12:58.574 --> 1:13:00.409
You never talk to me.

1:13:01.844 --> 1:13:05.180
We never went to dinner
to talk about...

1:13:05.714 --> 1:13:07.082
periods.

1:13:12.254 --> 1:13:14.289
I'm sorry, but I'm definitely
not mad at you.

1:13:20.195 --> 1:13:23.065
Can I tell you something that
I've not told anybody before?

1:13:28.904 --> 1:13:30.773
We were in the bathroom.

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:34.042
And the stall where we hid,

1:13:35.878 --> 1:13:37.913
there was a moment where I...

1:13:37.980 --> 1:13:39.648
really thought
I was gonna die.

1:13:41.817 --> 1:13:44.052
And it was
the scariest moment of my life.

1:13:47.089 --> 1:13:52.060
And the only person
I could think of was you.

1:13:52.127 --> 1:13:54.763
Do you remember when I sent you
that "I love you, too"?

1:13:56.432 --> 1:13:58.400
I thought I only had time
to text one person,

1:13:58.467 --> 1:13:59.568
so I texted you.

1:14:02.504 --> 1:14:04.173
I didn't know that.

1:14:07.743 --> 1:14:10.512
You're my favorite person
on Earth, Millie.

1:14:15.451 --> 1:14:17.085
Even if you get married
one day?

1:14:17.152 --> 1:14:19.154
No, fuck a husband.

1:14:21.023 --> 1:14:22.624
You're my number one.

1:14:29.765 --> 1:14:31.834
Don't let go.

1:15:25.854 --> 1:15:27.589
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1:15:28.690 --> 1:15:30.559
Nothing is wrong with you.

1:15:30.659 --> 1:15:33.495
Oh, Dad, I...

1:15:33.562 --> 1:15:35.063
I feel so...

1:15:36.698 --> 1:15:38.033
empty.

1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:41.603
Vada, you went
through something

1:15:41.703 --> 1:15:44.239
no one should ever have
to go through.

1:15:47.409 --> 1:15:49.444
I can't imagine
how scared you feel.

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:58.453
Life's fuckin' hard.

1:15:58.554 --> 1:16:01.523
I'm sorry
for saying "fucking".

1:16:01.590 --> 1:16:03.892
No, you're right.

1:16:03.959 --> 1:16:06.094
Life's fucking hard!

1:16:06.194 --> 1:16:07.296
Dad.

1:16:07.396 --> 1:16:09.197
What? No one's around.

1:16:09.264 --> 1:16:12.100
Try it, it feels good.

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:14.803
Life is fucking crazy!

1:16:18.707 --> 1:16:20.108
Yeah!

1:16:21.043 --> 1:16:22.144
Fuck!

1:16:24.046 --> 1:16:26.715
Life's fucking confusing!

1:16:35.924 --> 1:16:38.327
I can't fucking feel anything!

1:16:38.427 --> 1:16:39.394
Good one.

1:16:40.662 --> 1:16:42.631
Fuck you, Matt Corgan!

1:16:42.731 --> 1:16:45.167
Yeah, fuck you!

1:16:46.802 --> 1:16:50.472
I'm scared to go to school
every day!

1:16:50.572 --> 1:16:53.842
I'm scared to take my children
to school!

1:16:55.143 --> 1:16:56.612
I'm scared to sleep!

1:16:57.913 --> 1:17:00.282
I'm scared of...

1:17:00.349 --> 1:17:02.117
time!

1:17:03.318 --> 1:17:05.354
We're not even
swearing anymore, Dad.

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:06.788
Still feels good.

1:17:09.691 --> 1:17:12.294
I'm incredibly proud

1:17:12.361 --> 1:17:15.697
of how smart and amazing

1:17:15.797 --> 1:17:17.032
my daughter is!

1:17:17.132 --> 1:17:20.535
Dad, don't be fucking cheesy!

1:17:20.636 --> 1:17:22.638
- Please!

1:17:23.872 --> 1:17:26.041
Never again.

1:17:28.443 --> 1:17:30.012
Ah!

1:18:17.159 --> 1:18:18.226
Mia?

1:18:36.845 --> 1:18:38.346
Mia?

1:18:51.426 --> 1:18:53.061
Oh, my god!

1:18:54.096 --> 1:18:55.697
Mia?

1:18:57.466 --> 1:18:59.101
- Mia?

1:19:00.736 --> 1:19:02.204
My God.

1:19:03.605 --> 1:19:05.107
I'm just sweating out.

1:19:05.207 --> 1:19:06.742
I thought you were
fucking dead, dude.

1:19:06.808 --> 1:19:08.410
Don't scare me like that.

1:19:08.477 --> 1:19:09.745
Ah...

1:19:09.811 --> 1:19:10.912
Come on.

1:19:10.979 --> 1:19:12.280
Come on.

1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:26.228
Do you hate me?

1:19:28.497 --> 1:19:31.733
No. Why would I hate you?

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:38.173
Just scared the shit out of me.

1:19:45.347 --> 1:19:46.915
And I don't regret it.

1:19:49.951 --> 1:19:53.121
Just scared it was gonna like
ruin our friendship
or something.

1:19:57.526 --> 1:19:59.928
Yeah, I was scared
of that, too.

1:20:06.134 --> 1:20:08.370
Then let's not ruin anything?

1:20:11.106 --> 1:20:12.641
Okay.

1:20:33.862 --> 1:20:37.365
I think I'm gonna go back to
dance tomorrow.

1:20:37.465 --> 1:20:40.335
Even though, I'm like literally
scared to leave my house,

1:20:40.402 --> 1:20:42.204
I know I need to do it.

1:20:42.304 --> 1:20:44.239
That's amazing.
You totally should.

1:20:49.211 --> 1:20:50.378
Well, what are you gonna do?

1:20:50.478 --> 1:20:52.547
I'm gonna go with you.

1:20:52.647 --> 1:20:54.482
No, you're not.
We never discussed this.

1:20:54.549 --> 1:20:57.352
Stop trying to get rid of me!

1:20:59.588 --> 1:21:01.523
I am Postmate-ing us
frozen yogurt.

1:21:05.727 --> 1:21:07.229
I think I actually want some.

1:21:07.329 --> 1:21:09.164
Okay, then push.

1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:14.269
I like the doodles.

1:21:14.369 --> 1:21:17.172
Who's that guy?
Is that Harry Potter?

1:21:17.239 --> 1:21:18.607
That's Paul Dano.

1:21:18.707 --> 1:21:20.075
He's my celebrity crush.

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:26.448
How was this?

1:21:26.548 --> 1:21:29.384
Processing through
all these emotions?

1:21:29.451 --> 1:21:30.452
Good.

1:21:32.287 --> 1:21:36.024
I had a lot of ups and downs,

1:21:36.091 --> 1:21:39.728
but I feel like
I felt everything.

1:21:39.794 --> 1:21:41.630
So that's...

1:21:41.730 --> 1:21:43.431
It's good, I guess.

1:21:43.531 --> 1:21:47.135
I noticed that you used
the word "scared" a few times.

1:21:47.235 --> 1:21:48.737
When did you feel
the most scared?

1:21:53.708 --> 1:21:55.277
Being at school.

1:21:57.746 --> 1:22:00.315
I don't feel comfortable
being back there.

1:22:00.415 --> 1:22:04.219
Can you tell me more
about that?

1:22:04.286 --> 1:22:05.654
You know,
all these kids from my school,

1:22:05.754 --> 1:22:09.324
specifically one of
my closest friends, Nick,

1:22:09.424 --> 1:22:12.394
who I love so much, um...

1:22:13.595 --> 1:22:16.264
they've been able to take

1:22:16.331 --> 1:22:18.400
what happened, and...

1:22:20.402 --> 1:22:25.507
are literally using it
to change the world.

1:22:25.607 --> 1:22:28.410
Like, they're doing so much
amazing stuff and...

1:22:32.914 --> 1:22:36.251
For some reason, I feel like
I'm unable to do that.

1:22:40.188 --> 1:22:44.092
I feel like
it has kind of ended
our friendship.

1:22:48.363 --> 1:22:49.864
Sucks.

1:22:51.533 --> 1:22:53.468
'Cause I really,
really miss him.

1:22:55.337 --> 1:22:57.005
What are you feeling right now?

1:23:00.175 --> 1:23:02.010
I don't know.

1:23:02.110 --> 1:23:03.445
Yes, you do.

1:23:13.321 --> 1:23:14.889
I feel...

1:23:19.027 --> 1:23:20.662
mad.

1:23:23.298 --> 1:23:24.466
Mad about what?

1:23:24.532 --> 1:23:28.136
I feel mad,
because I had no idea

1:23:28.203 --> 1:23:29.337
one guy with a gun

1:23:29.404 --> 1:23:31.906
could fuck up my life so hard

1:23:32.007 --> 1:23:34.342
in six minutes.

1:23:34.409 --> 1:23:37.078
Fuck up so many lives!

1:23:37.178 --> 1:23:40.248
Then I think I should be
grateful to be alive.

1:23:42.050 --> 1:23:44.252
I feel like, I don't know,
maybe there's some

1:23:44.352 --> 1:23:46.321
weird fucked up reason why

1:23:46.388 --> 1:23:50.025
I made it
and other people didn't.

1:23:50.091 --> 1:23:53.528
Um, but then when you sit back

1:23:53.595 --> 1:23:58.233
and you think about it,
you realize, "No!

1:23:58.333 --> 1:23:59.701
There isn't.

1:24:02.337 --> 1:24:03.605
There's no fucking reason."

1:24:05.373 --> 1:24:07.375
None of us should've died.

1:24:26.728 --> 1:24:29.697
I'm having a really hard time
moving on.

1:24:51.319 --> 1:24:53.721
Oh, hi.

1:24:53.788 --> 1:24:55.323
I'm sorry.

1:24:57.392 --> 1:24:59.461
I love you.

1:24:59.561 --> 1:25:02.730
Sweetheart, I love you, too.

1:25:02.797 --> 1:25:06.000
I'm gonna try to be more honest
with you about my life.

1:25:07.335 --> 1:25:08.403
You know what?

1:25:08.470 --> 1:25:12.774
I would really,
really like that.

1:25:17.112 --> 1:25:19.013
I've been really struggling.

1:25:19.114 --> 1:25:20.515
Mmm-hmm.

1:25:20.615 --> 1:25:22.684
And I don't know why it's been
so hard to tell you like,

1:25:22.784 --> 1:25:24.486
'cause I just didn't
want you to worry.

1:25:24.586 --> 1:25:28.089
And you're right, I was acting
funny that time I was drunk,

1:25:28.156 --> 1:25:31.259
because I did have sex
with someone.

1:25:31.326 --> 1:25:33.928
And I was a little bit stoned,
but not as stoned

1:25:33.995 --> 1:25:36.464
as I was when I was on E.

1:25:36.531 --> 1:25:38.032
Jesus, that was rough.

1:25:38.133 --> 1:25:40.201
And the person I was having sex
with wasn't the person

1:25:40.301 --> 1:25:42.337
that I thought
I was maybe gonna
be having sex with,

1:25:42.437 --> 1:25:44.339
but I'm...
I'm telling you all of this,

1:25:44.439 --> 1:25:47.041
because I want you to know
that I'm...

1:25:47.142 --> 1:25:50.278
I'm never gonna do any of that
stuff ever again.

1:25:50.345 --> 1:25:52.313
You know, the bad...
The bad stuff.

1:25:53.982 --> 1:25:55.717
Mmm-hmm.

1:25:57.152 --> 1:25:58.486
Mmm-hmm.

1:26:00.688 --> 1:26:03.958
Okay. Well,
thank you for uh...

1:26:05.326 --> 1:26:06.528
For trusting me.

1:26:07.328 --> 1:26:08.696
With this information.

1:26:15.136 --> 1:26:16.304
Was that too much?

1:26:16.371 --> 1:26:18.406
No! I am...

1:26:20.175 --> 1:26:21.676
I'm processing.

1:26:24.179 --> 1:26:25.547
Don't worry,
it was with a girl.

1:26:25.647 --> 1:26:26.681
Hmm?

1:26:26.748 --> 1:26:28.149
The sex stuff.

1:26:28.216 --> 1:26:30.552
It was with a girl,

1:26:30.652 --> 1:26:32.353
so it's not
like I'm gonna get pregnant.

1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:34.589
That's a bonus, right?

1:26:34.689 --> 1:26:36.591
Yeah.

1:26:36.691 --> 1:26:38.660
Bonus.

1:26:48.369 --> 1:26:50.572
Okay.

1:26:50.672 --> 1:26:52.941
I'm... I'm ready
to talk about it more now.
