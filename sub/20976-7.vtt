>> My name is Jonathan,
and I need these lips

00:58.467 --> 01:01.400
to become bigger
and even more beautiful.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.600
I was six years old
when I moved from San Francisco

01:03.600 --> 01:06.467
to Vancouver, Canada.
Growing up, my mom got me

01:06.467 --> 01:08.333
a male doll.
He had, you know,

01:08.333 --> 01:11.266
blond highlights in his hair.
He had blue eyes.

01:11.266 --> 01:13.400
I just thought he was
perfection to me, and I really

01:13.400 --> 01:15.400
wanted to look like that.
After that, I started

01:15.400 --> 01:17.500
wearing makeup,
and I started going tanning

01:17.500 --> 01:21.266
when I was in grade 11.
You would never catch me pale.

01:21.266 --> 01:24.367
I never walk around or leave
the house without a spray tan.

01:24.367 --> 01:27.367
I obviously fill my eyebrows in.
I put false eyelashes on

01:27.367 --> 01:30.233
every day, use lip liner
to overdraw my lips

01:30.233 --> 01:33.266
to make my lip look even bigger.
I always wear my color contacts,

01:33.266 --> 01:35.266
and I always have highlights
in my hair.

01:35.266 --> 01:38.500
I am obsessed with looking fake.
It's perfection to me.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.233
I think it's attractive.
People are drawn to you

01:41.233 --> 01:43.367
when you look fake.
Growing up, my lips were

01:43.367 --> 01:45.667
definitely smaller.
They were just very simple

01:45.667 --> 01:48.300
and basic-looking.
On my 25th birthday,

01:48.300 --> 01:50.233
I called the doctor
and made an appointment

01:50.233 --> 01:53.300
and got my first lip injection.
I thought it wasn't big enough.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.500
I went back after a month,
and I told him the size

01:55.500 --> 01:57.567
that I want my lips to be,
and they refused to put

01:57.567 --> 02:00.533
that much fillers in my lips--
that it was dangerous,

02:00.533 --> 02:03.266
I know it's not dangerous.
I've seen people

02:03.266 --> 02:05.266
with bigger lips before.
I walk into the room,

02:05.266 --> 02:07.266
I need to have
the biggest lip in the room.

02:07.266 --> 02:09.300
I think that my lips
have brought a lot of attention

02:09.300 --> 02:12.266
to me, and I definitely love
that attention, and I don't want

02:12.266 --> 02:15.433
that attention to stop.
If my lips were not this big,

02:15.433 --> 02:17.533
I think I would definitely be
in depression.

02:17.533 --> 02:21.433
[chuckles] I-I think I would
look in the mirror and think

02:21.433 --> 02:24.400
that I look super basic
and super simple.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.700
I don't want to look basic.
I'm not gonna go from a glamazon

02:26.700 --> 02:29.600
to a basic girl.
I think that it'll make me

02:29.600 --> 02:32.400
a lot happier
if my lips were bigger.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.700
They're just not big enough yet.
And I am determined that

02:34.700 --> 02:38.266
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif can
give me the lips of my dream.

My breasts have gone south...

literally.
After breastfeeding two children

02:48.600 --> 02:52.567
within a 2 1/2-year span,
my breasts filled up,

02:52.567 --> 02:56.600
and then they deflated,
and they were very saggy

02:56.600 --> 03:00.633
and droopy, and my nipples
were pointing downward.

03:00.633 --> 03:05.300
It was not cute at all.
One of my girlfriends

03:05.300 --> 03:07.633
had had hers done,

I decided, "Okay, well,
he's the doctor for me."

He didn't think that I was
going to need a lift.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.734
What he was wanting to have
happen was the implant

03:14.734 --> 03:18.333
to raise my nipples
in the process

03:18.333 --> 03:20.600
and have them point
outward the way that

03:20.600 --> 03:23.567
they're supposed to.
After the surgery,

03:23.567 --> 03:26.367
I loved my breasts.
I loved that I looked youthful

03:26.367 --> 03:28.600
and had the fullness
that I desired again.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.600
My husband loved them.
He was glad that he actually got

03:30.600 --> 03:36.467

Three to four months after

03:36.467 --> 03:39.500
my surgery, some of the implant
was starting to stick out

03:39.500 --> 03:42.633
of both sides of my breast.
I went to see the surgeon,

03:42.633 --> 03:45.467
and he basically
looked at my breasts

03:45.467 --> 03:49.333
and said, "Oh, they look fine.
They're not gonna be

03:49.333 --> 03:52.500
100% perfect."
I was frustrated

03:52.500 --> 03:55.633

I knew that I didn't want

03:55.633 --> 03:58.734

09:06.633 --> 09:09.133
surrounding Darlene's breasts,
I need to do a careful

09:09.133 --> 09:12.233
physical examination to know
exactly how much droopiness

09:12.233 --> 09:15.066
she has,
what the status of her implants

09:15.066 --> 09:17.133
are, and whether I can
help her or not.

09:17.133 --> 09:21.767
You're 28 centimeters
from here to the nipple.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.667
Ideally, it should be
21 centimeters,

09:23.667 --> 09:27.767
so you're this far too low.
In addition, and even worse,

09:27.767 --> 09:29.734
your nipple's supposed to be
in the center of the mound,

09:29.734 --> 09:31.633
and it's at the very bottom.
>> Right.

09:31.633 --> 09:35.066
>> So it's at the 6:00 position.
Scar tissue has formed

09:35.066 --> 09:37.100
around the implant
because it's on top

09:37.100 --> 09:38.734
of the muscle.
>> Mm-hmm.

09:38.734 --> 09:40.300
>> And that's called
encapsulation.

09:40.300 --> 09:44.100
When that gets worse, a process
called capsular contracture,

09:44.100 --> 09:46.633
which means it forces
the implant up

09:46.633 --> 09:50.633
'cause it squeezes up, because
the inframammary crease is there

09:50.633 --> 09:52.333
preventing it from going down,
so it goes where it can go.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.133
>> Yeah.
>> It goes up.

09:54.133 --> 09:56.633
>> The pain that I do feel
is usually around the sides

09:56.633 --> 09:59.033
of the breast.
It is frustrating to know

09:59.033 --> 10:02.166
for sure that that could've been
possibly prevented by going

10:02.166 --> 10:04.300
under the muscle initially.
>> So here's the question.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.033
>> Mm-hmm.
>> What type of lift to do?

10:07.033 --> 10:09.133
And this for me is
the most important conversation

10:09.133 --> 10:14.100
because you have to
sign on to breast scars.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.767
Essentially, her breast tissue
is hanging off her implants.

10:17.767 --> 10:21.266
Until I get in there surgically,
remove the implant,

10:21.266 --> 10:24.300
put them into a new pocket,
I can't figure out

10:24.300 --> 10:27.033
what type of lift to do.
The implant is up here,

10:27.033 --> 10:29.300
and your breast tissue is,
like, almost in

10:29.300 --> 10:31.200
another zip code.
>> Yeah.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.333
>> So we have to get those
to be neighbors again, right?

10:34.333 --> 10:36.166
>> Okay.
>> Right.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.300
>> But you need, like,
almost every move made

10:38.300 --> 10:40.333
in advanced breast surgery
to fix this.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.266
>> Okay, as long as there's
enough for a handful

10:42.266 --> 10:44.066

>> Yeah, exactly,

10:44.066 --> 10:46.033
I got big hands.
>> This guy's got big hands.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.700
Whoa. Whoa.
>> You do have big hands.

10:47.700 --> 10:51.000
>> Wow!
Marcel has ginormous hands.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.300
Last thing I want to do
is short-change muscular Marcel.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.000
>> You got soft hands.
You moisturize?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.667

>> I could tell.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.266

11:00.266 --> 11:02.266

>> He's very soft, you know?

my self-esteem horribly.
From that point forward,

11:59.133 --> 12:01.767
I made a decision.
I was gonna do whatever it took

12:01.767 --> 12:04.333

18:25.266 --> 18:27.367
With Darlene's surgery today,
there's a bunch

18:27.367 --> 18:30.266
of complicated steps.
The first thing is her implants

18:30.266 --> 18:33.400
are in the on-top-of-the-muscle
position, so I have to go in

18:33.400 --> 18:35.533
and take those out.
The right breast is very

18:35.533 --> 18:38.533
scarred, and the left isn't,
so they're very, very

18:38.533 --> 18:41.266
not only uneven,
but they're also changed

18:41.266 --> 18:44.266
because of the scar-tissue
growth within them.

18:44.266 --> 18:45.734
In addition, putting them
under the muscle is

18:45.734 --> 18:48.667
a very tricky thing to do
when you have a pocket

18:48.667 --> 18:52.433
on top of the muscle.
So I won't know till I actually

18:52.433 --> 18:55.567
take the implants out,
lift up the muscle,

18:55.567 --> 18:59.400
put the implants in that
new under-the-muscle position

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
and start working
with the areola to figure out

19:01.400 --> 19:04.266
whether it's worth it to do
a lift and how big an implant

19:04.266 --> 19:06.533
I can put in.
I'll begin by removing

19:06.533 --> 19:09.433
Darlene's saline implants,
then create a new breast pocket

19:09.433 --> 19:12.533
by elevating the muscle.
Then I'll insert the silicone

19:12.533 --> 19:14.400
implant and, depending
on the outcome,

19:14.400 --> 19:17.333
do some type of lift
to be decided in surgery.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.300
This will give Darlene
the breasts she should've had

19:19.300 --> 19:22.400
from the start.
So, in the right breast,

19:22.400 --> 19:27.433
we took the implant out,
which is a 550 cc

19:27.433 --> 19:30.433
silicone implant
on top of the muscle.

19:30.433 --> 19:33.767
It had encapsulated and moved
the breast up, giving that

19:33.767 --> 19:36.300
upper fullness up there
and causing the nipple

19:36.300 --> 19:38.300
to go down.
So what we're going to do

19:38.300 --> 19:40.700
to try to prevent this
from happening again

19:40.700 --> 19:43.700
is to lift up the muscle
and put this under the muscle.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.700
It's always a little more
challenging in someone who's

19:45.700 --> 19:47.700
totally into fitness,
'cause their muscle's

19:47.700 --> 19:49.700
so much thicker.
All right, let's go deal

19:49.700 --> 19:54.300
with some more bleeding here.
Stop bleeding.

19:54.300 --> 19:57.367
All right, let's try on
about a 500.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.567
>> 500?
>> That looks super weird.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.700
Tight.
All right, can we sit her up?

20:02.700 --> 20:06.633
So, using her implants under
the muscle without any lift,

20:06.633 --> 20:09.333
we can see what they look like.
I actually did find a lot of

20:09.333 --> 20:12.500
scar tissue in Darlene's pocket,
but I was able to manipulate it

20:12.500 --> 20:16.467
in a really nice, effective way
so that she has a really nice

20:16.467 --> 20:19.000
breast shape now.
Now that Darlene's breast shape

20:19.000 --> 20:24.333
is looking good, I'm not sure
we actually need to do a lift.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.734
I just don't know.
Right now I'm 50/50.

20:26.734 --> 20:28.600
I don't know.
It seems like I've got

20:28.600 --> 20:31.734
a nice lift just by putting
the implants in the proper

20:31.734 --> 20:36.000
pocket position.
A lift would elevate her nipples

20:36.000 --> 20:39.367
into a slightly higher position
but at the cost of scars.

20:39.367 --> 20:41.333
For me, I'd rather not have
the scars,

20:41.333 --> 20:42.700
but some people don't care
at all about scars.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.600
They just care
about breast-mound position

20:44.600 --> 20:46.500
more importantly.
I don't know.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.667
It's just a hard choice to make.
I want to get her husband

20:48.667 --> 20:51.500
in here and see what he thinks.
When it comes to a breast lift

20:51.500 --> 20:53.567
it's all about the scars,
so it really depends

20:53.567 --> 20:56.700
on her tolerance for the scars.
For that, I'm gonna bring

20:56.700 --> 20:59.367
her husband, Marcel, in
to get his input

20:59.367 --> 21:03.633
before I commit her to any
significant breast scarring.

21:03.633 --> 21:05.633
Hey, how are you?
>> Hey, what's going on?

21:05.633 --> 21:07.500
>> Okay, so let me tell you
where we're at.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
Everything's going very nicely.
We have a decision to make.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.567
>> Okay, okay.
>> Okay? As to whether to

21:11.567 --> 21:13.567
lift her or not.
I want you to help me

21:13.567 --> 21:15.533
make that decision.
>> Okay.

21:15.533 --> 21:18.433
>> What I've done is I've
simulated without cutting it

21:18.433 --> 21:21.367
what a lift will look like.
It's a pretty breast, isn't it?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.033
>> No, it's beautiful.
Do the lift.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.667
>> Do the lift? I agree.
>> Do the lift, and I know

21:24.667 --> 21:26.500
she'd like it.
>> Okay.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.567
>> 'Cause if I didn't, I'd get
a smack against the head,

21:28.567 --> 21:31.000

21:37.533 --> 21:39.533
to a home-run result
with Darlene as possible today.

21:39.533 --> 21:42.700
It was really great to have
Marcel there helping me to make

21:42.700 --> 21:46.033
the decision, and, ultimately,
if she doesn't like it,

21:46.033 --> 21:49.000
it's his problem, not mine,
and that's a good thing.

which is just about to poke
out of her nasal skin.

For Belinda's surgery today,

24:01.033 --> 24:04.533
while my team extracts a large
piece of rib from her chest

24:04.533 --> 24:06.667
wall, I'll begin by carefully
lifting the skin off

24:06.667 --> 24:09.700
the nasal structure.
Once the tip is safely exposed,

24:09.700 --> 24:11.767
I'll use the rib to create
support for her collapsed

24:11.767 --> 24:14.667
nasal passages.
Then I'll break the nasal bones

24:14.667 --> 24:17.133
and reshape the nose
by shortening it,

24:17.133 --> 24:19.734
rounding it out,
and softening the tip.

Belinda will have a shorter,

of bleeding in the beginning

right now--Hold on.
Because the anatomy's different.

24:59.567 --> 25:01.066
Grab that blood vessel.
Belinda had these little

25:01.066 --> 25:03.567
blood vessels that just kept
oozing, and that was a pain

25:03.567 --> 25:06.166
in the butt, but the good news
about that is that we know

25:06.166 --> 25:08.567
she has good blood supply.
Now I got to tell you what's

25:08.567 --> 25:12.066
scary about what I just did.
I had to cauterize bleeding

25:12.066 --> 25:15.700
on both sides, which feeds
the whole nasal skin,

25:15.700 --> 25:18.033
and I just hope I don't have
any problems with that,

25:18.033 --> 25:20.700

Okay, watch the skin.

>> Mm-hmm.
>> Yeah, I'm already about to

25:23.166 --> 25:26.166
pop through the skin here.
We already knew that Belinda's

25:26.166 --> 25:28.567
nasal skin was gonna be
extremely thin,

25:28.567 --> 25:31.033
and as we're doing it now,
trying to peel off her skin

25:31.033 --> 25:34.033
from her tip cartilage
is difficult,

25:34.033 --> 25:36.033
and there's a high likelihood
that we could get a hole

25:36.033 --> 25:39.066
in the skin by doing this.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.233
Obviously, I have fillers
in my lips right now.

29:12.233 --> 29:15.767
>> Why do you want fuller lips?
>> Growing up, I've always been

29:15.767 --> 29:17.367
obsessed with dolls,
and I really wanted

29:17.367 --> 29:20.100
to look like that.
So, when I was 25, I started

29:20.100 --> 29:22.367
getting Botox and fillers.
So I became obsessed

29:22.367 --> 29:24.367
with lip injection,
and ever since then, I've been

29:24.367 --> 29:26.433
going every three months.
Every time I want to get

29:26.433 --> 29:29.000
two vials,
but the doctor always talked me

29:29.000 --> 29:31.133
into getting one.
She was like, "Well, girl,

29:31.133 --> 29:33.233
you have a lot of fillers
in your lips," and she wouldn't

29:33.233 --> 29:36.033
do a full vial for me.
She gave me half a vial,

29:36.033 --> 29:38.767
but what I want is every time
I go, I want one vial

29:38.767 --> 29:43.233
on the top, one vial
on the bottom at least.

29:43.233 --> 29:44.767

Obviously I have fillers

29:54.433 --> 29:57.266
in my lips right now.
>> How much in each lip?

29:57.266 --> 30:00.400
>> Well, in the past two years
I've got about 11 vials

30:00.400 --> 30:04.133
in my lips.
>> A half vial should translate

30:04.133 --> 30:07.300
into 1/2 cc.
There's 1 cc

30:07.300 --> 30:10.066
in a syringe usually.
I think Jonathan is getting

30:10.066 --> 30:12.333
filler a little bit too much
every three months.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.400
>> So you'd like to keep them
this size?

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
>> No, I want them bigger,
but they wouldn't do it for me.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.266
>> Why did they tell you
they wouldn't do it?

30:18.266 --> 30:20.133

30:20.133 --> 30:22.066

30:24.200 --> 30:26.300
it was dangerous.

Hmm.

30:30.133 --> 30:32.433
Partly.
Jonathan has what we call

30:32.433 --> 30:35.433
lip incompetence,
which means he can't close

30:35.433 --> 30:39.300
his lip to a perfect seal.
That means he already has

30:39.300 --> 30:42.033
too much filler in his lip,
and to go any further

30:42.033 --> 30:44.433

36:38.200 --> 36:40.700
I'm hoping Dr. Nassif will
tell me that everything

36:40.700 --> 36:43.600
looks great, the healing
process is on track,

36:43.600 --> 36:47.633
and the surgery went well.
>> Miss Belinda.

36:47.633 --> 36:49.500
>> Hey.
>> both: How are you?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.367
>> I'm good.
>> Wow.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.467
Aren't you gonna say it?
"You should've seen

36:53.467 --> 36:55.500
the other guy"?
>> Oh, yeah.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.467
I'm not feeling the pain
in my nose so much.

36:57.467 --> 36:59.533
I think I look much worse
than I actually feel.

36:59.533 --> 37:02.400
It's mainly the rib pain.
>> How much pain are you in?

37:02.400 --> 37:05.367
>> My ribs hurt me pretty bad--
worse than I thought.

37:05.367 --> 37:07.633
>> There's a reason for that.
Your rib--it was a little bit

37:07.633 --> 37:09.633
hard to take it out
because there was some bone

37:09.633 --> 37:12.400
or calcification on the rib.
So to remove that rib,

37:12.400 --> 37:15.333
we had to take a little chisel
and a mallet and carve it

37:15.333 --> 37:16.500
out of your chest.
>> Oh, okay.

37:16.500 --> 37:21.200
>> And then, unfortunately,
that whole rib was not usable.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.633
>> Oh.
>> Now, why did that happen?

37:23.633 --> 37:25.734
Usually you're a little bit
young to have that happen.

37:25.734 --> 37:27.533
Did you have any trauma
in your chest?

37:27.533 --> 37:30.300
>> I had broken ribs years ago.
>> Oh.

37:30.300 --> 37:32.767
>> Now, did we get that history?
>> I forgot about it. I didn't--

37:32.767 --> 37:34.533
>> Yeah, because then you
have to kind of mention that

37:34.533 --> 37:37.367
when I asked, so...
Belinda somehow,

37:37.367 --> 37:40.266
all of a sudden, remembers,
"Oh, yeah,

37:40.266 --> 37:42.567
I did have some fractures
in my ribs."

37:42.567 --> 37:45.700
Well, that explains it all.
Let me just take this off.

37:45.700 --> 37:48.533
Remember, you couldn't breathe.
You were completely collapsed.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.700
Tilt your head back for us.
>> Oh, wow.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.500
>> So remember how her tip
had those two...

37:52.500 --> 37:54.400
>> Look how open that is.
>> Pieces of bossa

37:54.400 --> 37:55.700
sticking out?
>> Oh, right.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.433
>> Breathe for me a little bit.
>> There you go.

37:58.433 --> 38:00.266
>> Yeah, I can get air.
It's awesome.

38:00.266 --> 38:02.500
Big difference already.
Even though I'm gauzed up

38:02.500 --> 38:05.400
with the splints, I'm already
breathing much better

38:05.400 --> 38:09.500
than I was prior to my surgery,
so I'm tickled pink about that.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.667
>> So your nose right now
looks beautiful,

38:11.667 --> 38:13.533
but I'll tell, you we had
our work cut out for it.

38:13.533 --> 38:15.667
It was a long surgery.
>> My hero.

>> I am, too, yep.

>> Yes, absolutely.

38:28.433 --> 38:30.567

How can you look pretty

38:32.567 --> 38:34.567

But I do.

38:34.567 --> 38:37.433

Thank you.
