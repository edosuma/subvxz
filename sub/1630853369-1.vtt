16:40.625 --> 16:43.875
and this stroke has affected his brain.

16:45.083 --> 16:48.250
All we can do is keep him comfortable.

16:50.541 --> 16:52.666
[Mona] When can I take him home?

16:52.750 --> 16:55.541
[Doctor] Your father's in a coma.

16:55.625 --> 16:59.583
I would encourage you to call your family.

16:59.666 --> 17:02.625
How do you know he won't survive?

17:03.708 --> 17:07.041
[Doctor] Call your family, Ms. Ghumun.

18:11.625 --> 18:12.875
[Sandy] Excuse me.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.208
You can't be watching that.

Hey?

18:17.541 --> 18:18.541
Hi.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.458
You can't do this.

18:20.541 --> 18:21.666
[Driver] No problem.

18:21.750 --> 18:22.666
How's this?

18:24.791 --> 18:26.916
I'm gonna report this guy.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.416
He has a five-star rating.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.958
Ma'am, you want air?

18:34.041 --> 18:34.875
No.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.916
Dad's not recovering from that stroke.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.083
I don't know why Mona brought him home.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.333
I mean, you were on the call.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.791
You heard the doctors, right, Parm?

18:48.875 --> 18:49.708
Parm?

18:52.208 --> 18:54.250
Dad can't come back from this, right?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.583
Probably not.

18:58.041 --> 18:58.958
Ma'am.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.625
-I'm good.
-Parm.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.625
You said you've seen patients
come back from worse.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.833
Yeah, those were miracle cases.

19:07.916 --> 19:11.708
I've seen, maybe two, my entire career.

19:11.791 --> 19:13.750
[Sandy] Dad was very clear
that he wanted to allow

19:13.833 --> 19:15.333
for a natural death.

19:15.416 --> 19:19.000
In case a situation exactly
like this one arose.

19:19.083 --> 19:23.208
The ethical thing to do is to honor that.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.125
So.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.333
As soon as we get home,
we're taking Dad back

They're not gonna hook
him up to any machines. Nothing.

forced to live like this.

How is that wrong?

Well, if Dad wakes up.

comes over and eats our food and gossips.

27:49.083 --> 27:49.916
That's what it is.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.166
-[Sandy] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-[Parm] Come on.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.833
-[Sandy] Mona, come on.
Have some respect.

27:52.916 --> 27:54.083
[Mona] I am just being honest.

27:54.166 --> 27:55.041
-[Rup] I like the honesty…
-[Puaji gasps]

27:55.125 --> 27:55.958
…not in front of everyone.

27:56.041 --> 27:56.958
-Oh my God.
-[Rup] Oh God.

27:57.041 --> 27:58.750
[Auntie moans]

27:58.833 --> 28:00.541
[Sandy] Parm, she doesn't look good.

28:00.625 --> 28:02.208
-[Parm] Water.
-[Sandy] Is she okay?

28:02.291 --> 28:04.666
[Sandy in Punjabi]
We are here to help, Auntie.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.125
[coughing]

28:06.208 --> 28:09.541
[in Punjabi] Sandy, my wise girl.

28:09.625 --> 28:13.125
[in English] My brother needs
God and prayer.

28:13.208 --> 28:15.750
Our father needs peace and quiet.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.791
[in Punjabi] Auntie, can’t we do this
prayer at the temple?

28:18.875 --> 28:22.541
[in Punjabi] No, no, no my boy, no!

28:24.041 --> 28:29.500
[in Punjabi] My brother needs to
hear the Guru’s pure words,

28:29.583 --> 28:31.083
continuously for three days.

28:31.166 --> 28:33.041
[Rup in English] I got water. I got water.

28:33.125 --> 28:36.708
[in Punjabi] Auntie, drink water.

28:36.791 --> 28:37.666
Let her do the <i>paath</i>.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.333
You guys were conveniently not present

28:39.416 --> 28:41.125
when she did the <i>paath </i>last year.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.875
Or the one before that.
Or the one before that.

28:42.958 --> 28:44.666
Or the one before that. Okay?

28:44.750 --> 28:49.041
[in Punjabi] Manjit, Manjit, girl,
my good girl, listen to me.

28:49.125 --> 28:49.958
No!

28:50.041 --> 28:51.333
Puaji, I'm putting my foot down.

28:51.416 --> 28:52.458
This is my house.

28:52.541 --> 28:56.291
This house, actually,
belongs to all of us.

28:56.375 --> 28:58.166
And I say she should do it.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.791
[Mona scoffs]

29:00.875 --> 29:01.708
I agree.

29:03.291 --> 29:04.125
Yeah.

29:05.458 --> 29:06.500
Okay.

29:06.583 --> 29:09.000
[laughs] Okay.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.166
Well, guess what?

29:10.250 --> 29:13.375
I didn't wanna do this to you guys, but,

29:13.458 --> 29:14.916
you leave me no choice.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
This is what happens.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.875
Where the hell?

29:20.125 --> 29:21.500
Shit!

29:21.583 --> 29:23.083
-[rumbling]
-[Mona shouts]

29:23.166 --> 29:24.000
Okay!

29:25.125 --> 29:26.208
-Rup!
-What?

29:26.291 --> 29:27.125
-Ow!
-[keys jangling]

29:27.208 --> 29:28.041
Come!

29:29.125 --> 29:31.708
Okay. All right.

29:31.791 --> 29:33.791
[in Punjabi] God is Truth. God is Truth.
[in English] I don't know.

29:33.875 --> 29:34.708
[in Punjabi] It’s okay. It’s okay.

29:34.791 --> 29:35.750
-[in English] Let's go.
-No.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.833
We're not indulging this, Parm.

29:37.916 --> 29:39.166
Puaji, call me if you need anything.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.083
[door slams]

29:40.166 --> 29:42.791
[in Punjabi] Oh my sweet boy!

29:42.875 --> 29:45.875
[in Punjabi] May you live well, stay well,
have a long, long life.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.333
-[Parm laughing]
-[in Punjabi] Go.

29:48.416 --> 29:50.916
[in Punjabi] You go, too, my good girl.
You are a wise girl. Go. Go!

29:51.000 --> 29:53.083
[in Punjabi] What are you
still doing here? Go, go.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.833
[in Punjabi] God is Truth.

29:56.625 --> 30:01.958
[in Punjabi] Priest, quickly, before Mona
returns, let’s start the prayers!

30:02.041 --> 30:05.375
Then what can they do after that?
First, let’s move everything,

30:05.458 --> 30:09.958
Pick up that table.
Priest, don’t spill my water.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.916
Okay, take this table over there.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.833
Pick up the cushions. Here, I will pass
them to you. Here you go.

30:18.458 --> 30:19.666
[Sandy] Mona, where are we going?

30:19.750 --> 30:21.041
[Mona] You'll see when we get there.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.750
Because if I tell you now,
it's gonna be a thing.

30:22.833 --> 30:23.833
[Rup] I'm not following anybody.

30:23.916 --> 30:26.000
I'm the boss of me, okay?

30:26.083 --> 30:28.625
[Parm] Just tell us where we're going.

30:28.708 --> 30:31.125
[Sandy] Where are we going?

30:31.208 --> 30:32.041
[Mona] Hi.

30:32.125 --> 30:34.375
We have an appointment with Mr. Maloney.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.041
Last name's Ghumun.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.416
I'm so sorry, but it
wasn't noted in our system

30:40.500 --> 30:42.125
and he's in meetings all day.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.041
Can you come back tomorrow?

30:43.125 --> 30:44.708
-Not a problem.
-No. We can't.

30:44.791 --> 30:47.333
My siblings flew into
Regina for this meeting.

30:47.416 --> 30:48.833
We don't actually have an appointment.

30:48.916 --> 30:49.958
My sister, she's just
very triggered right now.

30:50.041 --> 30:50.875
[fist thuds]

30:50.958 --> 30:52.041
-Mona!
-You can't go in there. Ma'am!

30:53.166 --> 30:54.000
Shit.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.375
[man] Definitely.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.458
Jason.

31:00.541 --> 31:02.750
Jason, I'm gonna have to call you back.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.250
I'll get that answer for you, bud.

31:04.333 --> 31:05.916
Okay. Okay, buh bye.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.333
I'm so sorry, Mr. Maloney.

31:07.416 --> 31:09.708
I told her you were occupied.

31:09.791 --> 31:10.666
That's okay, Rene.

31:10.750 --> 31:11.750
No problem.

31:11.833 --> 31:14.083
Give us a minute, though.

31:14.166 --> 31:15.541
Should I invite the rest in?

31:15.625 --> 31:18.166
[Mr. Maloney] You want the rest?

31:18.250 --> 31:20.333
Yes, invite them in, Rene.

31:20.416 --> 31:21.333
Go ahead.

31:22.916 --> 31:25.291
[metal clanging]

31:25.375 --> 31:26.541
Mona.

31:26.625 --> 31:27.458
Brent.

31:28.458 --> 31:29.583
Hello.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.000
We're very sorry for this intrusion.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.541
That's all right. Brent Maloney.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.750
-Sandy.
-Hi, Sandy.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.083
-Pleasure.
-Please take a seat.

31:35.166 --> 31:37.416
-Hi. Rup.
-Hey, Rup. Nice to meet you.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.750
-Brent Maloney.
-Sorry about this.

31:38.833 --> 31:40.166
-Well that's all right.
-Parm.

31:40.250 --> 31:43.083
Hey, Parm, I think I've
talked to you on the phone.

31:43.166 --> 31:44.625
Sit down, please.

31:44.708 --> 31:46.291
Everyone just stay nice and comfortable.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.791
Or get comfortable.

31:47.875 --> 31:49.375
Thanks for coming.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.458
Hi. So.

31:53.541 --> 31:54.791
What can I do for you all?

31:54.875 --> 31:57.250
Well, my siblings and
I have power of attorney

31:57.333 --> 31:59.875
over our father's accounts,
and so we would like to know

31:59.958 --> 32:01.083
the contents of his will.

32:01.166 --> 32:03.000
Has your father passed away?

32:03.083 --> 32:05.791
-[Sandy] No, he hasn't.
-He hasn't. He's had a serious stroke.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.125
He's in a coma.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.458
I'm really sorry about this.

32:10.541 --> 32:12.541
Mona, what're you doin'?

32:15.583 --> 32:16.458
Mister…

32:16.541 --> 32:18.833
-[Brent] Maloney.
-Maloney.

32:18.916 --> 32:25.250
Hypothetically speaking,
if the house belongs to me

32:25.333 --> 32:27.833
and our father's in a
state of unresponsiveness,

32:27.916 --> 32:31.541
then I would have full authority
on whatever takes place

32:31.625 --> 32:33.583
inside that house, correct?

32:33.666 --> 32:36.583
If the house is solely
in your name, then yes,

32:36.666 --> 32:38.666
you can decide what
takes place inside of it

32:38.750 --> 32:39.625
anytime you want.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.208
Why do you care so much about the <i>paath</i>?

32:43.291 --> 32:45.250
Because I need to protect myself.

32:45.333 --> 32:48.125
Because I will not be bamboozled.

32:48.208 --> 32:50.583
-No on is bamboozling you.
-Bamboozled?

32:50.666 --> 32:52.666
-Choice of language.
-Are you kidding?

32:52.750 --> 32:53.625
Are you kidding me?

32:53.708 --> 32:54.833
You guys come in here.

32:54.916 --> 32:56.625
And whatever.
You guys are fancy, bossy people--

32:56.708 --> 32:57.541
No, no, no, no. Hold on a second.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.916
We come in here?
You're the one that dragged us into this--

33:00.000 --> 33:01.875
[Mona] But you guys come to
the house and then it's like,

33:01.958 --> 33:03.125
it's your way or the highway--

33:03.208 --> 33:04.541
I wanna know. I wanna know.
I wanna know.

33:04.625 --> 33:05.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.291
-He wants to know.
-I wanna know. We're here.

33:07.375 --> 33:09.791
-It's our way or the highway?
-Let her just say--

33:09.875 --> 33:11.166
I'm pretty sure we had no
idea where we were going.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.458
[all chattering over each other]

33:14.541 --> 33:17.250
[Brent] Okay. Okay.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.416
Let's just take a breath.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.458
Yes, let's all take a breath.

33:24.333 --> 33:29.208
I know how difficult it is
to care for an aging parent.

33:29.291 --> 33:30.666
Even in good times.

33:30.750 --> 33:33.041
But this particular
situation is not as uncommon

33:33.125 --> 33:35.375
as you might think.

33:35.458 --> 33:38.125
So, all four of you do
have power of attorney,

33:38.208 --> 33:41.875
so, therefore, I am
legally bound to disclose

33:41.958 --> 33:44.625
all the contents of your father's assets,

33:44.708 --> 33:46.250
if it's being requested.

33:46.333 --> 33:49.250
Which I believe Mona is requesting.

33:50.125 --> 33:50.958
Yeah.

33:51.041 --> 33:56.041
All right, well then let's
get this will popped up here.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.875
[keyboard clacking]

33:59.958 --> 34:00.791
Okay.

34:00.875 --> 34:05.291
Well, let's just go over
all the smaller points here.

34:06.375 --> 34:11.250
All assets, from the house,
to the car, to all monies

34:11.333 --> 34:14.833
is to be passed to Parminder Singh Ghumun.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.625
[Sandy And Mona] What?

34:18.708 --> 34:19.708
Of course.

34:28.041 --> 34:29.791
Parents sometimes do it this way.

34:29.875 --> 34:34.791
It's a bit of a simpler task
in divvying up all the assets.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.375
[Rup] Are those? [clears throat]

34:47.458 --> 34:48.458
Are those chocolates?

34:48.541 --> 34:50.041
[Brent] Yeah.

34:50.125 --> 34:51.375
I'm just gonna grab one of these.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.291
Excuse me.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.333
Anything else?

34:55.416 --> 34:56.375
[Rup] Guess that's it.

34:56.458 --> 34:58.458
Well, thanks for stopping in.

34:58.541 --> 34:59.375
[Parm] Thank you.

34:59.458 --> 35:00.458
Thank you.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.416
[Rup] Thank you, Brent.

35:06.833 --> 35:07.875
[door closes]

35:10.166 --> 35:13.000
-[exhales slowly]
-[tense music plays]

35:13.083 --> 35:14.416
[inaudible]

35:15.958 --> 35:18.500
[cars passing]

35:31.916 --> 35:34.500
[car creaking]

35:52.083 --> 35:53.625
Pull in here.

35:53.708 --> 35:54.541
[Rup] Here?
What do you mean here?

35:54.625 --> 35:57.833
-Here. Here, here. Pull in here.
-[Rup] Okay.

35:57.916 --> 36:01.291
[loud rock music plays]

36:01.375 --> 36:02.500
[Mona] Congratulations.

36:02.583 --> 36:06.958
You get all of Dad's money,
now you get a beer.

36:07.041 --> 36:09.125
[Parm] Don't you think we
should be getting back to Dad?

36:09.208 --> 36:11.083
Puaji gets to play doctor.

36:11.166 --> 36:12.458
Give her a moment to shine.

36:12.541 --> 36:14.125
Susie!

36:14.208 --> 36:15.041
Karen!

36:16.166 --> 36:17.000
Okay, um.

36:17.916 --> 36:20.166
A pitcher of beer, please?

36:20.250 --> 36:21.416
Wait, you know what?

36:21.500 --> 36:22.500
Make it two.

36:23.666 --> 36:25.500
-Okay.
-Confession.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.000
This place smells like pee.

36:29.083 --> 36:31.250
When I was 15, I snuck in
here and I got the whole bar

36:31.333 --> 36:33.208
to sing "Oh Canada".

36:33.291 --> 36:34.833
Bet you I can do it again.

36:34.916 --> 36:36.333
We believe you.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.416
So, tell me the truth, Parm.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.208
You knew about the will, right?
Dad told you?

36:45.291 --> 36:46.125
No.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.916
I can read your mind, kid.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.208
We're practically Siamese twins.

36:52.291 --> 36:53.875
Tell me the truth. Look at my face.

36:53.958 --> 36:55.708
Look at my face.

36:55.791 --> 36:58.000
You knew about the will, right?

36:58.083 --> 36:58.916
No.

37:02.666 --> 37:04.416
I don't know why you're so surprised.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.333
This is the golden boy.

37:06.416 --> 37:07.916
-The three of us can't compete.
-That's not true.

37:08.000 --> 37:08.833
[Sandy And Mona] That's true.

37:08.916 --> 37:11.500
It's totally true.
You wear a turban, you went to Oxford.

37:11.583 --> 37:12.708
You make more money than I do.

37:12.791 --> 37:14.375
-You're a doctor.
-So is Sandy.

37:14.458 --> 37:17.000
Yeah, but she's a girl
and Dad's a misogynist.

37:17.083 --> 37:20.083
The kind of misogynist
that let the boy twin

37:20.166 --> 37:23.250
go to hockey camp all summer and,
as I remember correctly,

37:23.333 --> 37:26.666
the girl twin had to stay
at home under house arrest.

Where the hell were you
guys the last seven years?

52:05.791 --> 52:08.375
-We flew in all the time.
-[Mona] Yeah, but you weren't here.

52:08.458 --> 52:10.625
We checked in every day.

52:11.583 --> 52:14.125
You barely called us back
unless you needed money.

52:14.208 --> 52:16.625
Yeah, but you weren't here.

52:16.708 --> 52:18.041
[Parm] Mona, we never
asked you to be the one

52:18.125 --> 52:19.291
to take care of him.

52:19.375 --> 52:22.791
[Sandy] You need to face reality, Mona.

52:26.625 --> 52:27.958
You're a cunt.

52:31.250 --> 52:33.541
[Rup] Wait! Mona!
Mona, what about the house?

52:36.625 --> 52:37.791
What was that?

52:39.541 --> 52:41.208
What was that?

52:41.291 --> 52:42.583
Where were you guys?

52:42.666 --> 52:44.125
You didn't have my back.

52:44.208 --> 52:45.875
You just left me to hang out there and dry

52:45.958 --> 52:47.083
and make me look like the bad guy.

52:47.166 --> 52:48.416
-Sandy, Sandy.
-As you always, you always.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.208
You're going in on her about
employment and job prospects.

52:50.291 --> 52:51.750
You always put it on me.

52:51.833 --> 52:53.583
You always make me say the hard shit.

52:53.666 --> 52:55.250
Sandy! Listen to me.

52:55.333 --> 52:56.875
The conversation was about the house!
Selling the house!

52:56.958 --> 52:58.125
-It was about the house…
-That's it, that's it, Sandy.

52:58.208 --> 52:59.250
…and then it became about
something else,

52:59.333 --> 53:01.125
and you never have my back!

53:01.208 --> 53:03.125
You took it that way!
Am I going crazy here?

53:03.208 --> 53:04.791
Parm, wait! Parm!

53:04.875 --> 53:06.875
Sandy, you can't just
attack somebody like that!

53:06.958 --> 53:08.916
[Sandy] Somebody
needs to tell her the truth.

53:12.083 --> 53:13.875
[knock thudding]

53:13.958 --> 53:15.625
-Mr. Rop.
-It's Rup.

53:15.708 --> 53:17.291
-Hey.
-Good news.

53:17.375 --> 53:18.833
I've seen this problem before.

53:18.916 --> 53:23.416
Bad news, you'll have to redo the pipes
out to mid-street level.

53:23.500 --> 53:24.416
Probably.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.833
It's not a small job.

53:25.916 --> 53:27.916
Okay. Well, how much does it cost?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.375
Just ballpark it for me, Patrick, please.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.208
[Patrick] About 25.

53:33.333 --> 53:36.041
-That's hundred?
-[chuckles] No, uh.

53:36.125 --> 53:36.958
Thousand.

53:38.208 --> 53:39.041
Yeah.

53:46.083 --> 53:46.916
Right.

53:48.875 --> 53:51.291
[soft music plays]

54:00.708 --> 54:03.125
[Parm sighs]

54:03.958 --> 54:05.666
[Parm] Hey.

54:05.750 --> 54:06.583
You okay?

54:10.083 --> 54:14.458
Just so you know, the Aunties
are watching you smoke.

54:24.291 --> 54:27.125
[Aunties gasping]

54:29.916 --> 54:31.375
[Parm] What are you doing?

54:31.458 --> 54:34.791
[growls] You're insane.

54:34.875 --> 54:36.000
You're literally insane.

54:36.083 --> 54:38.083
You're an insane person.

54:39.291 --> 54:41.291
That's not what I meant.

54:41.375 --> 54:43.375
[sighs]

54:48.250 --> 54:51.666
[hockey sticks clacking]

54:56.583 --> 54:58.000
Where's the ball?

54:59.958 --> 55:04.541
-[Mona] One, two, three.
-[rock music plays]

55:06.708 --> 55:09.375
[Mona laughing]

55:17.916 --> 55:20.416
[Parm shouts]

55:24.625 --> 55:25.583
Yes!

55:25.666 --> 55:28.375
[both laughing]

55:28.458 --> 55:31.083
Russia scores.

55:31.166 --> 55:33.041
Always Russia, huh?

55:33.125 --> 55:34.458
Always Russia.

55:36.666 --> 55:39.958
You wanted to run away there.

55:40.041 --> 55:41.458
Almost did.

55:41.541 --> 55:44.291
Until Dad found me at the bus stop.

55:44.375 --> 55:46.708
That was a beating.

55:46.791 --> 55:49.708
[sighs] I've had worse.

55:49.791 --> 55:53.083
No, actually, that one was pretty bad.

55:59.750 --> 56:00.791
Why aren't you writing?

56:00.875 --> 56:01.875
Oh my God.

56:02.791 --> 56:04.000
You're on my case, too?

56:04.083 --> 56:05.625
Just saying.

56:05.708 --> 56:07.125
Where's the book?

56:10.791 --> 56:12.541
It's right in here.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.958
I'm worried about you, Mona.

56:31.833 --> 56:34.750
[cloth scratching]

56:34.833 --> 56:35.666
I am.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.041
I'm worried about Rup.

56:41.916 --> 56:44.333
What's that thing on his face?

56:44.416 --> 56:46.250
-His goatee?
-Is that what it is?

56:46.333 --> 56:48.916
Because it looks like roadkill.

56:50.375 --> 56:51.750
[chuckles]

56:51.833 --> 56:54.000
Should we tell him?

56:54.083 --> 56:56.166
[laughs]

[hockey stick clatters]

57:00.916 --> 57:04.000
[footsteps plodding]

57:10.500 --> 57:14.208
You know when Dad was diagnosed,
the doctors gave him

57:14.291 --> 57:15.875
six months to live?

57:19.416 --> 57:21.583
You gave him seven years.

57:24.333 --> 57:29.000
If you can do that, imagine
what you could do out there.

57:32.375 --> 57:35.375
[footsteps plodding]

57:35.458 --> 57:36.500
Just get outta here, Mona.

57:36.583 --> 57:37.541
Go somewhere.

57:37.625 --> 57:38.708
Do something.

57:40.708 --> 57:43.125
[soft music plays]

57:53.291 --> 57:55.541

58:39.000 --> 58:40.708
[Fiona] <i>Hello? Fiona Lason here.</i>

58:40.791 --> 58:43.958
Cock-a-doodle-doo! [laughs]

58:44.041 --> 58:44.958
Hey, Fiona!

58:46.708 --> 58:48.125
Fiona, it's Mona.

58:49.500 --> 58:50.375
Ghumun.

58:50.458 --> 58:51.458
Mona Ghumun.

58:54.083 --> 58:55.708
Geez, it's been what,
like, eight years?

58:55.791 --> 58:56.958
How are you?

58:57.041 --> 58:58.458
How's Tiger?

58:58.541 --> 58:59.375
Teegris.

58:59.875 --> 59:03.125
[Fiona sighs] <i>Teeger died.</i>

59:03.208 --> 59:06.208
Oh, I'm sorry.

59:06.291 --> 59:07.625
Um.

59:07.708 --> 59:10.708
Well, I'm super fat now. [laughs]

59:10.791 --> 59:12.416
I'm joking.

59:12.500 --> 59:14.958
[Fiona clears throat]

59:15.041 --> 59:16.333
Hey, listen, I just
wanted to get in touch,

59:16.416 --> 59:21.208
because, man, Fiona, I have an idea.

59:21.291 --> 59:22.666
I have a book.

59:22.750 --> 59:26.125
It's mostly in my head,
but it's really good. It's really smart.

59:26.208 --> 59:29.416
It's about trans-generational trauma.

59:29.500 --> 59:32.666
I can get you a treatment in ten days.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.291
[Fiona] I lost my job because of you.

59:37.375 --> 59:38.208
Oh?

59:41.333 --> 59:43.500
[Fiona] <i>You made me wait</i>
<i>for a draft for a year.</i>

59:43.583 --> 59:45.291
<i>And I believed in you so much</i>

59:45.375 --> 59:50.333
<i>that I kept telling the</i>
<i>publisher you were good for it.</i>

59:50.583 --> 59:51.416
Oh.

59:55.791 --> 59:56.625
Look, I…

59:59.791 --> 1:00:03.416
You know, things were bad with Dad.

1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:04.500
He was sick.

1:00:05.833 --> 1:00:07.708
I was partying a lot.

1:00:07.791 --> 1:00:09.000
I got into that car accident.

1:00:09.083 --> 1:00:10.500
I just wasn't…

1:00:10.583 --> 1:00:11.500
I couldn't…

1:00:14.250 --> 1:00:17.250
But, look, Fiona, I haven't stopped.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.083
I'm here.

1:00:19.166 --> 1:00:20.625
I'm ready now.

1:00:20.708 --> 1:00:21.541
I'm ready.

1:00:24.958 --> 1:00:27.458
[Fiona] <i>Well I'm not.</i>

1:00:27.541 --> 1:00:29.333
<i>Don't call me again, Mona.</i>

1:00:45.416 --> 1:00:49.708
[man chanting in Punjabi]

1:01:06.833 --> 1:01:08.791
It's a really nice beach.

1:01:08.875 --> 1:01:11.041
And a really small bikini.

1:01:13.708 --> 1:01:16.625
Yeah, Priya's havin' a good time.

1:01:17.583 --> 1:01:19.833
Doesn't bother you that
she's in Cuba without you?

1:01:19.916 --> 1:01:22.083
Posting pictures like this?

1:01:22.166 --> 1:01:23.000
No.

1:01:24.708 --> 1:01:25.916
Who's taking those photos?

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.166
I don't know. Self-timer?

1:01:30.833 --> 1:01:33.166
Do you have an open
marriage I don't know about?

1:01:33.250 --> 1:01:34.500
-What?
-It's okay if you do.

1:01:34.583 --> 1:01:36.041
-You can tell me.
-No.

1:01:36.125 --> 1:01:38.250
-Honest to God.
-No. Come on.

1:01:41.125 --> 1:01:42.250
And she's not cheating on you?

1:01:42.333 --> 1:01:44.083
She's not cheating.

1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:52.500

1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:58.166
-I can't…
-Breathe.

1:01:58.250 --> 1:01:59.666
You're okay.

1:01:59.750 --> 1:02:01.583
I can't… [breathing heavily]

[Sandy] Hey. Hey.

1:02:07.125 --> 1:02:08.291
Open the door.

1:02:11.916 --> 1:02:13.416
Rup.

1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:15.833
We need to talk about this.

1:02:17.083 --> 1:02:20.791
[Rup] Been with her
since before Mom died.

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:23.333
Mom.

1:02:25.333 --> 1:02:26.500
Mom loved her.

1:02:27.375 --> 1:02:28.333
[Sandy] I know.

1:02:28.416 --> 1:02:30.666
But Mom loved everyone.

1:02:30.750 --> 1:02:33.583
I tried so hard to make it work.

1:02:35.375 --> 1:02:38.625
She says I don't make her feel special.

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:42.625
So now she's spending our anniversary

1:02:42.708 --> 1:02:44.000
with someone who does.

1:02:44.083 --> 1:02:45.000
Sandy.

1:02:45.083 --> 1:02:46.708
We need more chai. Okay?

1:02:46.791 --> 1:02:50.458
And, um, there's a bubba
who says he's lightheaded

1:02:50.541 --> 1:02:53.625
because he's hungry,
but he's also diabetic

1:02:53.708 --> 1:02:56.208
and he's gluten-free.
What do I feed him?

1:02:56.291 --> 1:02:57.833
I can't make jell-o right now.

1:02:57.916 --> 1:03:00.791
Goodie Auntie made some pakoras.

1:03:00.875 --> 1:03:05.083
You don't know for certain
that she's having an affair.

1:03:05.166 --> 1:03:07.583
You don't think she is?

1:03:07.666 --> 1:03:08.583
No, I do.

1:03:10.916 --> 1:03:12.875
[Parm] Sorry, where are they?

1:03:12.958 --> 1:03:14.541
-Is Mona in there?
-Rup.

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:15.458
Fridge.

1:03:16.333 --> 1:03:17.166
Fridge.

1:03:19.375 --> 1:03:21.375
Affairs are very common.

1:03:22.416 --> 1:03:23.458
[whispers] He's having an affair?

1:03:23.541 --> 1:03:26.458
[inaudible]

1:03:26.541 --> 1:03:27.875
Modern marriages?

1:03:27.958 --> 1:03:29.375
They're set up to fail.

1:03:29.458 --> 1:03:31.291
You take two people who
like each other enough

1:03:31.375 --> 1:03:35.416
and tell them to build
a life, and have kids,

1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:37.375
and make money.

1:03:37.458 --> 1:03:38.875
And have great sex, for what?

1:03:38.958 --> 1:03:40.458
The next 65 years?

1:03:42.125 --> 1:03:43.750
Who can live up to those standards?

1:03:43.833 --> 1:03:44.666
[whispers] Sandy.

1:03:46.375 --> 1:03:48.125
[mouthing] They're not in there.

1:03:52.041 --> 1:03:53.875
Oh.Thanks.

1:03:57.708 --> 1:03:59.041
Rup.

1:03:59.125 --> 1:04:02.625
I have seen affairs make couples stronger.

1:04:05.041 --> 1:04:06.291
Like, once.

1:04:06.375 --> 1:04:08.166
There was one couple.

1:04:08.250 --> 1:04:11.333
But who's to say that you guys can't?

1:04:15.666 --> 1:04:18.333
[knocks on door]

1:04:18.416 --> 1:04:20.875
Rup, I'm really sorry, man.

1:04:22.541 --> 1:04:25.125
Is there some ketchup in there?

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:28.083
[Sandy] Are you serious right now?

1:04:28.166 --> 1:04:29.666
[Parm] Well, he's been
after me for 20 minutes--

1:04:29.750 --> 1:04:30.708
[Sandy] Did you look
in the freakin' fridge?

1:04:30.791 --> 1:04:31.750
[Parm] Sorry, Rup.

1:04:31.833 --> 1:04:33.291
Yeah.

1:04:33.375 --> 1:04:34.208
[Sandy] Thanks Rup.

1:04:34.291 --> 1:04:35.958
[Parm] Sorry.

1:04:36.041 --> 1:04:36.875
Sorry.

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:40.291
-Here.
-Thanks.

1:04:40.375 --> 1:04:41.375
Yep.

1:04:42.375 --> 1:04:43.291
-Thank you.
-You okay?

1:04:43.375 --> 1:04:44.541
Yeah, I'm great.

1:04:44.625 --> 1:04:45.458
Sorry.

1:04:48.791 --> 1:04:49.750
-[Sandy sighs]
-[door slams]

1:04:49.833 --> 1:04:51.625
Where's the cooker sauce?

1:04:51.708 --> 1:04:53.500
[Parm] Cooker sauce.

1:15:51.333 --> 1:15:52.583
[Sandy] Mona.

1:15:52.666 --> 1:15:54.333
[Parm] Mona, come on, open the door.

1:15:54.416 --> 1:15:55.375
[knocks pounding]

1:15:55.458 --> 1:15:56.875
-[Rup] Mona!
-[Parm] Come on, Mona. Open the door!

1:15:56.958 --> 1:15:58.666
[Rup] Mona! Open the door!

1:15:58.750 --> 1:16:00.625
[yelling] Mona! Open the door!

[Mona shrieks]

1:16:12.083 --> 1:16:13.250
Dad?

1:16:13.333 --> 1:16:14.625
Dad?

1:16:14.708 --> 1:16:15.541
Dad.

1:16:19.583 --> 1:16:22.750
[indistinct chanting]

1:16:25.208 --> 1:16:26.708
He was calling me.

1:16:27.625 --> 1:16:30.875
[Lilly] He's been fast asleep, honey.

1:16:31.791 --> 1:16:33.291
I'm gonna make some tea.

1:16:33.375 --> 1:16:36.625
Why don't you spend some time with him?

1:16:44.041 --> 1:16:47.375
[indistinct chattering]

1:17:18.833 --> 1:17:21.666
I'm sorry I told you about Parm.

1:17:27.125 --> 1:17:28.250
He's still the same perfect son

1:17:28.333 --> 1:17:30.500
that you raised him to be.

1:17:37.166 --> 1:17:40.875
And I'm sorry I brought you home, Dad.

1:17:40.958 --> 1:17:42.791
I just thought, maybe…

1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:51.208
[scoffs] I couldn't wait
to get out of this house

1:17:51.291 --> 1:17:55.000
when I was younger and now
I feel so under-qualified by life.

1:17:59.708 --> 1:18:02.166
Your DNA went sideways when
you made me and you created

1:18:02.250 --> 1:18:03.750
a defective model.

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:15.208
I just wanted you to see me.

1:18:19.041 --> 1:18:21.708
I just wanted you to ask for me.

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:25.666
Not Parm.

1:18:27.750 --> 1:18:28.583
Me.

1:18:30.375 --> 1:18:31.208
Hm?

1:19:12.416 --> 1:19:15.333
[melancholy music plays]

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.416
[in Punjabi] Amrit, bring him a pillow.

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:22.791
Poor thing, look how
uncomfortable he is, with his bare arms.

1:19:22.875 --> 1:19:26.000
[in Punjabi] This nurse doesn’t
do anything all day!

1:19:26.083 --> 1:19:30.583
I told them, children do the prayers.

1:19:30.666 --> 1:19:34.000
Look, my brother is now conscious!

1:19:34.083 --> 1:19:39.041
[in Punjabi] If we pray with a pure heart,
God will always hear us.

1:19:39.125 --> 1:19:40.416
See, he heard me.

1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:43.833
[knock thudding]

1:19:43.916 --> 1:19:45.166
[Sandy] Mr. Maloney.

1:19:45.250 --> 1:19:46.541
Hi Sandy.

1:19:46.625 --> 1:19:47.875
Is Mona around?

1:19:49.166 --> 1:19:50.583
[Sandy] She hasn't come down yet.

1:19:50.666 --> 1:19:52.916
Can we go somewhere private to talk?

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:54.000
Please?

1:19:54.083 --> 1:19:56.000
[Sandy] Oh, yeah.

1:19:56.083 --> 1:19:57.375
Thanks.

1:19:57.458 --> 1:19:58.333

1:19:58.416 --> 1:20:00.833
[door thuds]

1:20:02.166 --> 1:20:03.666
[Parm] Puaji.

[jewelry rattling]

1:20:23.958 --> 1:20:26.541
[Parm sighing]

1:20:31.458 --> 1:20:35.125
Squeeze my hand if
you're comfortable, Papa.

1:20:44.041 --> 1:20:45.291
I love you, Papa.

1:20:49.375 --> 1:20:51.375
So glad I could be here.

1:20:54.041 --> 1:20:57.125
There's somethin' I need to tell you.

1:21:00.125 --> 1:21:02.458
I need to tell you who I am.

1:21:12.875 --> 1:21:15.708
My name is Parminder Singh Ghumun.

1:21:19.833 --> 1:21:20.916
I'm a doctor.

1:21:24.500 --> 1:21:25.416
I'm a Sikh.

1:21:34.083 --> 1:21:35.083
And I'm gay.

1:21:45.583 --> 1:21:46.750
I'm gay, Papa.

1:21:51.666 --> 1:21:54.583
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

1:22:02.625 --> 1:22:03.791
I was scared.

1:22:03.875 --> 1:22:05.041
Scared of you.

1:22:10.583 --> 1:22:12.833
But I'm not scared of you anymore.

1:22:17.458 --> 1:22:18.291
Brent.

1:22:19.291 --> 1:22:21.875
You… [exhales]

1:22:25.333 --> 1:22:26.916
Mona's not dying.

1:22:28.708 --> 1:22:32.833
She used to tell us the
same story as a kid.

1:22:32.916 --> 1:22:34.208
What?

1:22:34.291 --> 1:22:37.875
What, I mean, her stomach? She's--

1:22:37.958 --> 1:22:40.541
[Both] Coughing up blood.

1:22:40.625 --> 1:22:42.625
Chemo's not an option?

1:22:44.375 --> 1:22:46.458
Chemo is not an option.

1:22:47.333 --> 1:22:48.916
Um.

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.250
So, wait, so, as a kid she--

1:22:52.833 --> 1:22:54.166
So she's not dying?

1:22:54.250 --> 1:22:55.083
No.

1:22:59.458 --> 1:23:00.291
Oh.

1:23:01.291 --> 1:23:03.791
Oh, well aren't I just a fool?

1:23:05.333 --> 1:23:06.166
Sorry.

1:23:08.958 --> 1:23:11.166
[hand slapping]

1:23:11.250 --> 1:23:12.125
Listen.

1:23:12.208 --> 1:23:13.791
It's anxiety.

1:23:13.875 --> 1:23:14.875
Right, Sand? It's…

1:23:16.416 --> 1:23:19.250
Look, she would say stuff
like this when she was feeling stressed.

1:23:19.333 --> 1:23:22.000
-It's not an excuse.
-It's not an excuse.

1:23:22.083 --> 1:23:24.000
I'll just excuse myself out.

1:23:24.083 --> 1:23:25.750
I'm really, really sorry.

1:23:25.833 --> 1:23:26.666
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1:23:26.750 --> 1:23:27.583
[Rup] Yeah, yeah.

1:23:27.666 --> 1:23:29.916
[Brent] I'm sorry, Sandy.

1:23:35.333 --> 1:23:38.583
I thought she stopped with the lying.

1:23:40.708 --> 1:23:41.958
[door clatters]

1:23:42.041 --> 1:23:43.291
[Sandy] Mona!

1:23:47.333 --> 1:23:48.666
[Mona] Hey.

1:23:48.750 --> 1:23:51.500
You think Dad'll find this funny?

1:23:52.708 --> 1:23:54.208
Brent just left.

1:23:55.458 --> 1:23:58.208
You told him you were dying?

1:23:58.291 --> 1:23:59.875
We're back to that?

1:24:01.041 --> 1:24:06.000
[Mona sighs] It just happened.

1:24:11.833 --> 1:24:14.583
[sighs]

1:24:14.666 --> 1:24:16.000
Um…

1:24:17.958 --> 1:24:19.708
It was stupid.

1:24:21.916 --> 1:24:25.000
You're a mean person, Mona,

1:24:25.083 --> 1:24:28.291
who just takes advantage of everybody.

1:24:29.875 --> 1:24:31.625
Stop living off of Dad.

1:24:33.125 --> 1:24:34.958
Stop taking our money.

1:24:37.583 --> 1:24:38.750
You're a liar.

1:24:41.958 --> 1:24:44.916
[Mona] That's not your real nose.

1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:50.000
Everybody knows that, but you
won't even tell your daughter.

1:24:50.916 --> 1:24:53.458
What are you talking about?

1:24:53.541 --> 1:24:56.291
Last year you came here
and Sasha asked you who

1:24:56.375 --> 1:24:57.916
she looks like.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.791
She looks exactly like you pre-nose job.

1:25:00.875 --> 1:25:02.166
But you told her she looks like Raj.

1:25:02.250 --> 1:25:05.416
Because you would rather her
believe that she has bad genes

1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:08.958
then be honest that you're
not whatever this is.

1:25:09.041 --> 1:25:10.250
You're a liar.

1:25:12.125 --> 1:25:14.041
You're a bitch.

1:25:14.125 --> 1:25:15.958
[Lilly] Mona! Mona, come quick!

1:25:16.041 --> 1:25:17.291
Your father!

[Funeral Attendant]
All right, we're all prepared.

1:28:36.208 --> 1:28:38.333
She said she'd be here.

1:28:39.375 --> 1:28:42.375
[Funeral Attendant] Are you ready?

1:28:46.458 --> 1:28:48.041
I'm not good at this.

1:28:50.916 --> 1:28:55.166
[soft singing in Punjabi]

1:29:49.625 --> 1:29:50.791

[footsteps thundering]

1:30:01.166 --> 1:30:02.041
What are you doing?

1:30:02.125 --> 1:30:03.125
[Mona sighs] Go away, Parm.

1:30:03.208 --> 1:30:04.166
What?

1:30:04.250 --> 1:30:05.875
[Mona] I can't deal with this right now.

1:30:05.958 --> 1:30:08.291
-[Parm] Where were you?
-Stop it, stop it.

1:30:08.375 --> 1:30:09.250
Just go away.

1:30:09.333 --> 1:30:10.458
Get up.

1:30:10.541 --> 1:30:11.916
-[Mona] Stop.
-Let's go.

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:13.166
-[Mona] Stop, stop, stop.
-Get up.

1:30:13.250 --> 1:30:15.625
[Mona] Just stop, please. Ow!

1:30:15.708 --> 1:30:17.958
What's the matter with you?

1:30:19.500 --> 1:30:20.791
Everything hurts.

1:30:20.875 --> 1:30:22.833
Get up. Let's go. Right now.

1:30:22.916 --> 1:30:24.166
-Get up. Right now.
-[Mona] No.

1:30:24.250 --> 1:30:25.125
[Parm] We're getting up right now.

1:30:25.208 --> 1:30:27.666
-Ow, stop it!
-[Parm] Enough! Enough!

1:30:27.750 --> 1:30:28.666
Do you understand?

1:30:28.750 --> 1:30:29.583
Stop it!

1:30:29.666 --> 1:30:31.208
-Just stop it!
-Oh my God.

1:30:31.291 --> 1:30:32.416
This is not a game!

1:30:32.500 --> 1:30:34.708
Mona, get up. Now!

1:30:34.791 --> 1:30:36.541
-[Mona] Get out of here, Parm.
-Right now!

1:30:36.625 --> 1:30:38.208
-Get up! Let's go!
-No.

1:30:38.291 --> 1:30:40.875
-Stop it! Don't! Don't!
-[Parm] You stop!

1:30:40.958 --> 1:30:43.250
Fucking get off of me!

1:30:43.333 --> 1:30:46.625
What is the matter with you?
What is the matter with you?

1:30:46.708 --> 1:30:47.625
No!

1:30:47.708 --> 1:30:50.666
What is the matter with you?!

1:30:50.750 --> 1:30:51.875
Parm, I-- [Mona shrieks]

1:30:51.958 --> 1:30:54.875
Stop it! Stop it, Mona!

1:30:54.958 --> 1:30:56.666
-Stop it, Mona!
-[Mona shrieks]

Whoa.

1:30:58.625 --> 1:30:59.458
Whoa.

1:31:01.083 --> 1:31:02.208
Parm!

1:31:02.291 --> 1:31:05.708
[Mona breathing heavily]

1:31:07.916 --> 1:31:08.916
[Mona sobs]

1:31:20.083 --> 1:31:21.083
[Sandy sobs]

1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:58.958
I should have protected you
from him, Mona.

1:31:59.041 --> 1:32:00.125
But I didn't.

1:32:05.250 --> 1:32:10.083
I just stood by and watched
every time he shouted at you.

1:32:10.166 --> 1:32:12.000
Every time he hit you.

1:32:15.958 --> 1:32:17.291
As your brother.

1:32:19.333 --> 1:32:21.625
I'm your brother.
I should've protected you.

1:32:26.750 --> 1:32:28.250
I was a bad kid.

1:32:30.833 --> 1:32:31.958
Bad kid?

1:32:32.041 --> 1:32:34.208
Mona, you were just a kid.

1:32:38.166 --> 1:32:40.208
You were a beautiful kid.

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:45.833
I'm sorry.

1:33:28.125 --> 1:33:31.375
[incinerator humming]

1:33:31.458 --> 1:33:35.458
-[Sandy sobbing]
-[button clicks]

1:33:35.541 --> 1:33:38.250
[fire crackling]

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.166
[Mona] Satsriakhal.

1:34:05.666 --> 1:34:11.708
My father was very dutiful
and he was really hardworking.

1:34:14.833 --> 1:34:16.833
[sighs]

1:34:18.916 --> 1:34:24.458
But that's, like, a
fraction, a tiny portion,

1:34:24.541 --> 1:34:26.250
of the person that he was.

1:34:28.791 --> 1:34:34.666
Gurpreet Singh Ghumun was,
he was tough, you know?

1:34:37.500 --> 1:34:39.833
He came from not much and he
expected a lot from himself

1:34:39.916 --> 1:34:42.333
and everyone else around him.

1:34:46.500 --> 1:34:49.833
Growing up, I was scared of him.

1:34:49.916 --> 1:34:52.750
He took up a lot of space.

1:34:52.833 --> 1:34:54.958
He felt larger than life.

1:34:57.500 --> 1:35:00.500
So, I guess that's why I used
to rebel so much against him.

1:35:00.583 --> 1:35:05.500
Because I just wanted to carve
out a little bit of space of my own.

1:35:08.125 --> 1:35:14.875
I remember years ago
I came home and

1:35:14.958 --> 1:35:17.000
I found my dad outside

1:35:17.083 --> 1:35:21.416
sitting in one of those white,
plastic patio chairs.

1:35:26.833 --> 1:35:29.916
And he was quiet, which he never was.

1:35:33.541 --> 1:35:36.708
He had made some big stupid
mistakes and, after 23 years,

1:35:36.791 --> 1:35:39.041
he had lost the grocery store.

1:35:41.041 --> 1:35:44.666
And I remember that look on his face.

1:35:44.750 --> 1:35:47.375
He wasn't angry, which was rare for him.

1:35:47.458 --> 1:35:51.458
He didn't have the energy
to lash out at anyone.

1:35:57.208 --> 1:36:00.041
He looked lost.

1:36:01.333 --> 1:36:02.833
Like he messed up.

1:36:04.750 --> 1:36:06.416
Like he let us down.

1:36:11.708 --> 1:36:13.541
When I saw him, I didn't know what to do,

1:36:13.625 --> 1:36:16.708
so I just went back inside the house.

1:36:20.833 --> 1:36:21.666
Yeah.

1:36:21.750 --> 1:36:25.666
I wish I could just go back and tell him.

1:36:25.750 --> 1:36:29.750
Tell him he didn't have
to be ashamed, you know?

1:36:31.083 --> 1:36:33.458
That he was more than his
paycheck and his grocery store.

1:36:33.541 --> 1:36:36.375
That he had messed up
and that it was okay.

1:36:39.916 --> 1:36:43.583
I don't think anyone
had ever told him that.

[Rup] Have you seen my glove?

1:38:28.291 --> 1:38:29.541
It's, like, black.

1:38:29.625 --> 1:38:31.458
It looks like a glove?

1:38:33.041 --> 1:38:34.125
Maybe it's…

1:38:35.041 --> 1:38:38.333
[knock pounding]

1:38:38.416 --> 1:38:41.208
-Yeah! Hussain!
-[Hussain laughs]

1:38:41.291 --> 1:38:42.875
-Ah, let me.
-Yeah, okay. Good, good.

1:38:42.958 --> 1:38:43.833
Thank you, thank you.

1:38:43.916 --> 1:38:46.208
Oh! And there's a ginger beef
in the car.

1:38:46.291 --> 1:38:48.750
Yes. [hand claps]

1:38:48.833 --> 1:38:50.000
Rup, here's your suitcase.

1:38:50.083 --> 1:38:51.458
And someone dropped a glove on the floor.

1:38:51.541 --> 1:38:53.541
Yeah, that's my glove.

1:38:55.708 --> 1:38:57.250
I'm so excited that
you're finally getting out

1:38:57.333 --> 1:38:58.291
of this house.

1:38:58.375 --> 1:38:59.750
But you need to leave Regina, you know?

1:38:59.833 --> 1:39:03.666
Okay, for your information,
I actually like this city. Okay?

1:39:03.750 --> 1:39:04.666
If that's okay with you?

1:39:04.750 --> 1:39:08.083
The people are really
cool and the weed is cheap

1:39:08.166 --> 1:39:10.208
and it takes 15 minutes to go anywhere.

1:39:10.291 --> 1:39:13.166
And, when you visit me in Toronto,

1:39:13.250 --> 1:39:14.666
you may not wanna leave.

1:39:14.750 --> 1:39:16.250
We'll see.

1:39:16.333 --> 1:39:17.375
Come on.

1:39:17.458 --> 1:39:18.458
Proper now.

1:39:18.541 --> 1:39:21.166
Come on. Come on.
Parm, come on.

1:39:21.250 --> 1:39:22.208
-Get in there.
-Okay.

1:39:22.291 --> 1:39:23.791
[Rup] Get in there. Yes.

1:39:25.083 --> 1:39:26.875

1:39:26.958 --> 1:39:28.708

1:39:32.750 --> 1:39:33.750
Come here.

1:39:35.416 --> 1:39:37.000
I love you.

1:39:37.083 --> 1:39:38.458
Sorry I called you a cunt.

1:39:38.541 --> 1:39:40.291
I'm sorry I called you a bitch.

1:39:40.375 --> 1:39:41.208
Mm.

1:39:42.875 --> 1:39:44.041
-Okay, I'll see you soon.
-[Mona] Mm hm.

1:39:44.125 --> 1:39:45.333
-Okay?
-'Kay.

1:39:45.416 --> 1:39:48.791
[fingers snap] Sorry. [mumbling]

1:39:49.833 --> 1:39:50.708
-And Parm?
-[Mona shudders]

1:39:50.791 --> 1:39:52.541
Grab that one, it's heavier.

1:39:52.625 --> 1:39:54.583
-Bye!
-[Mona] Bye.

1:39:55.416 --> 1:39:57.916
[giggles] Bye.

1:39:58.000 --> 1:39:59.875
[Parm] Bye, Mona.

1:40:00.708 --> 1:40:02.125
[Sandy] No, here. I don't…

1:40:02.208 --> 1:40:03.666
No, bring it over here.

1:40:03.750 --> 1:40:05.583
[Hussain] And the beef.

1:40:05.666 --> 1:40:07.000
[Rup] Thank you so much.

1:40:07.083 --> 1:40:08.458
I'm so hungry.

1:40:08.541 --> 1:40:09.833
[Sandy] Can you put the bag over here?

1:40:09.916 --> 1:40:11.291
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

1:40:11.375 --> 1:40:13.666
[Rup] Right there, and…

1:40:13.750 --> 1:40:15.333
-[Parm] Here you go. Thanks.
