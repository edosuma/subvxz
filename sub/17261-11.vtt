00:02.502 --> 00:03.586
(Melanie)
<i>Hot in Cleveland</i> is recorded

00:03.670 --> 00:05.922
in front
of a live studio audience.

00:06.005 --> 00:08.048
[cell phone chimes]

00:08.132 --> 00:09.759
Aw, damn it.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.052
This guy I'm playing
Words with Friends with

00:11.136 --> 00:11.928
is killing me.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.221
{\an1}Who is it?

00:13.304 --> 00:14.764
I don't know.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.100
{\an3}But as a detective,
I've cobbled together a profile.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.729
{\an3}Mid-40s, foul-mouthed,
and extremely intelligent.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.272
{\an3}He's beat me 20 times
in a row.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.941
Let's make it 21.

00:28.737 --> 00:33.783
Well, smartass 93-year-old
was my second guess.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.910
{\an1}Hey, Elka, we should play.
I'm really good at Scrabble.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.787
{\an1}You know what my nickname
was in high school?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.456
{\an3}Pizza face?

00:39.539 --> 00:42.959
{\an3}Back brace?
Four eyes?

00:43.042 --> 00:45.086
{\an1}Yes.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.255
{\an1}But it was also
Word Nerd.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.132
{\an1}While everyone else
was drinking and dancing

00:49.215 --> 00:52.343
{\an1}at the prom, I was at home
playing Scrabble.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.596
With my mom.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.139
Okay, everybody.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.974
{\an1}You can play your games,
but let's keep the competition

00:58.057 --> 00:59.350
at a friendly level.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.686
{\an1}Remember, Wilbur's staying
with us this week.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.354
{\an1}Oh, I love when your grandson
comes to stay.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.855
He is such a sweet little boy.

01:04.938 --> 01:06.858
{\an3}Yeah, he reminds me
of myself at that age

01:06.941 --> 01:08.651
back in Canada.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.153
{\an3}You know, if he plays
his cards right,

01:10.236 --> 01:12.322
{\an3}he too may one day
be captain of the high school

01:12.405 --> 01:13.990
maple tapping team.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.283
Have his pick.

01:15.366 --> 01:19.829
- Of the girls?
- No, of the trees.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.041
{\an3}Well,
enough of my glory days.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.418
{\an3}We still have to figure out
our presentation for tomorrow.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.003
{\an1}It's career day
at Wilbur's school.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.631
Bob and I are gonna talk
about being detectives.

01:29.714 --> 01:30.840
Shall we head back
to the office?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.759
{\an1}No, you go.
I was gonna stop by that place.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.010
Oh, pick me up a thing.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.386
{\an1}Yeah, but not the one
with the stuff.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.888
Ha!
No, what a mess.

01:36.971 --> 01:37.889
{\an1}Yeah.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.516
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.892
{\an1}Wow.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.519
{\an1}You and Bob almost seem
like a couple.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.521
What?
No.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.190
I mean, Bob is great,
but that special something

01:47.273 --> 01:48.525
is missing.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.859
You know how
when you love someone,

01:49.943 --> 01:50.985
there's sort of a glow
about them?

01:51.069 --> 01:52.237
An aura?

01:52.320 --> 01:55.657
{\an1}Yeah.
I want a guy that glows too.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.992
I had a guy
who glowed.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.870
Sinatra.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.872
Can you get through one day
without mentioning

02:02.956 --> 02:04.707
that you slept with Sinatra?

02:04.791 --> 02:09.336
I can.
But I won't.

02:09.419 --> 02:10.420
Hello, all.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.590
Hey.
Oh, cute outfit.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.008
We went outdoor spinning.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.260
You mean biking?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.387
Don't make it sound cheap.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.722
- You remember Barney.
- Hi, everyone.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.266
Vic, I'm gonna go fill up
our water bottles.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.811
- Oh, that is so sweet.
- This woman is awesome.

02:27.856 --> 02:32.402
Is he a friend of Wilbur's?

02:32.485 --> 02:36.614
You make your jokes, but dating
a younger man is fantastic.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.867
You know, coming to Cleveland
took a few years off me.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.870
And winning an Oscar
took a few more years off me.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.582
If I win a Grammy,
I could go to prom.

02:45.665 --> 02:50.962
Or stay home and play Scrabble
'cause that's a fun night too.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.631
Hey, babe.
It is so beautiful outside.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.718
What if we kept going
and biked the lake route?

02:56.801 --> 02:57.969
Unless you're not up for it.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.971
Oh, no, I'm totally up for it.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.389
{\an3}No, I'll--I'll meet you
out there.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.808
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.271
What are you waiting for?

03:08.354 --> 03:12.025
{\an3}Uh, my very young-looking legs
seem to have seized up a little.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.782

{\an8}I'm sorry, George.

03:32.170 --> 03:36.174
{\an9}I have your
Cesar Savory Delights.

03:36.257 --> 03:39.177
{\an8}I think he has a little crush
on the dog on the package.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.511
{\an8}Looks like a boy dog.

03:40.595 --> 03:44.432
{\an8}Don't judge, Melanie.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.060
{\an8}Okay, Word Nerd.
It's your turn.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.269
{\an8}Oh, I have
a really good word too.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.646
{\an8}Kahlua.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.106
{\an8}Oh, I also have a really good
recipe for Kahlua.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.693
{\an8}Then why are we playing
this stupid game?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.320
{\an8}Well, I hate to admit it,

03:57.403 --> 04:00.657
{\an7}but Barney might be
wearing me out.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.617
{\an8}Really?
What'd you do last night?

04:02.700 --> 04:06.496
{\an8}Ugh, we went to a midnight movie
and then dinner after.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.997
{\an8}I was so tired
when the meal came,

04:08.081 --> 04:12.001
{\an8}I might accidentally
have eaten it.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.297
{\an8}Is there a food called nachos,
or was I dreaming?

04:16.380 --> 04:19.300
{\an8}Victoria, maybe it's time
to admit that he's maybe

04:19.384 --> 04:20.885
{\an8}too young or you're maybe too--

04:20.969 --> 04:23.680
{\an8}Bup, bup, bup, bup--I cannot
hear the end of that sentence.

04:23.763 --> 04:28.643
{\an8}Well, when you get old,
your hearing goes too.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.813
{\an8}Well, would a person who is old
be going to meet her boyfriend

04:31.896 --> 04:33.815
{\an8}to play laser tag?

04:33.898 --> 04:36.234
{\an8}Oh, [bleep] my life.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.198
{\an7}So you see, kids,
our detective agency

04:42.281 --> 04:44.033
{\an7}specializes in cases
of...

04:44.117 --> 04:45.952
{\an9}infidelity.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.708
{\an3}And this woman here is the best
honey trap in the business.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.042
- Bob.
- Hmm?

04:53.126 --> 04:57.171
Grandma?
What's a honey trap?

04:57.255 --> 05:00.383
Wilbur, let me explain.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.553
{\an1}Say you're a man
and you have a cookie.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.722
{\an1}And you've had that cookie
for a while.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.683
And it's just not making
your mouth water anymore.

05:08.766 --> 05:11.936
It's become dried up
and...unappetizing.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.232
{\an1}That doesn't happen
to all cookies.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.568
{\an1}Some retain
their gooey freshness.

05:18.651 --> 05:23.114
Oh, yes, they do.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.451
{\an3}Anyway, kids, you go
looking for a new cookie,

05:26.534 --> 05:28.494
your old cookie
may get upset.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.079
And hire us.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.081
And the original cookie
might get a new car

05:32.165 --> 05:34.584
in the divorce.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.210
That's right,
Mrs. Johnson.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.464
It's Miss O'Roarke now.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.215
Are you two married?

05:41.299 --> 05:42.425
{\an3}Well, that's
an interesting question.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.718
{\an1}Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.386
No, uh, we're colleagues.

05:45.470 --> 05:50.099
I'm Wilbur's grandmother,
and Bob is Wilbur's...Bob.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.728
{\an3}It's true.
I am his Bob.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.982
Okay, boys and girls.
Time to retrieve your lunches.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.569
Thank you for coming in today,
Mr. Moore and Ms. Scroggs.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.123
- Here we go.
- Ah, thank you.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.334
You guys make
the cutest family.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.461
Oh, we're not a family.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.963
{\an1}I mean, Wilbur and I
are related, but Bob is my boss.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.298
Yes.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.759
Like Colin Firth
and his Portuguese housekeeper

06:24.842 --> 06:26.302
in <i> Love Actually.</i>

06:26.385 --> 06:29.931
Or Hugh Grant and his assistant,
also in <i> Love Actually.</i>

06:30.014 --> 06:32.850
A lot of people end up falling
in love with their bosses.

06:32.934 --> 06:37.355
That was the message
of that movie.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.817
{\an3}So, Wilbur, I saw a big kid
step on your lunch.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.820
That's Aiden.
He does it every day.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.531
I didn't see that.
Wilbur, why didn't you tell me?

06:46.614 --> 06:48.616
'Cause big boys don't like
to be tattletales,

06:48.699 --> 06:49.826
do they, Wilbur?

06:49.909 --> 06:54.163
Yeah.
Sometimes he pushes me down.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.998
{\an3}You know, if I taught you
a little karate,

06:56.082 --> 06:58.126
{\an3}you could fight back
if you had to.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.836
Or you could talk to Aiden
and tell him

06:59.919 --> 07:01.462
you don't like being pushed

07:01.546 --> 07:03.506
because fighting
doesn't solve things.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.383
Hey, cutie.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.717
Do you want to see the machine
that made your milkshake?

07:06.801 --> 07:09.345
(both)
Yeah.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.722
Bob?

07:13.391 --> 07:15.685
You know what?
I'm gonna talk to Melanie.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.104
She did conflict resolution
at her kids' school in LA.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.522
She'll know what to do.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.858
Bullies don't speak
conflict resolution.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.025
You've got to talk to them

07:23.109 --> 07:24.527
in the only language
they understand.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.070
Force.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.656
This may surprise you,
but I once knew someone

07:28.739 --> 07:30.032
- who was bullied.
- It's you.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.785
Yes, but that was gonna be
the twist ending.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.206
{\an1}I would like to thank
Aiden's parents, Pete and Kim,

07:37.290 --> 07:39.834
{\an1}for joining us
in conflict resolution.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.711
We call this the talking stick.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.380
{\an1}The person holding it
can share their feelings

07:44.463 --> 07:46.716
{\an1}without any fear
of judgment.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.384
I'm confused.

07:48.467 --> 07:53.764
{\an3}If that's the talking stick,
what do we call Joy?

08:00.479 --> 08:02.565
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.567
I--I was up until 4 a.m.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.776
You see, I'm dating this guy

08:05.860 --> 08:07.236
who's 20 years younger
than I am.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.405
20 years younger.
Really?

08:09.488 --> 08:12.033
Yeah, he's 60.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.703
Elka.

08:15.786 --> 08:19.582
I've got the stick.
I can say what I want.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.084
That's not how the stick works.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.252
{\an1}Pete, would you like
to start off?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.795
{\an1}Sure.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.174
{\an1}This whole thing feels like
a lot of LA nonsense.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.135
{\an3}This is just a simple case
of boys being boys.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.720
Young men have a lot of energy.

08:32.803 --> 08:37.558
Huh, that's for damn sure.

08:37.642 --> 08:41.229
{\an3}If you ask me, your son
needs to learn right from wrong.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.106
{\an3}Oh.
Look who's preaching morality.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.108
{\an3}Aiden told us that you trap men
into doing things

08:46.192 --> 08:47.485
by giving them cookies.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.821
With your legs.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.115
Give me that stick.
I can explain.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.994
First off--
yes, Joy has amazing legs.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.789
Long and shapely
and one can only imagine

08:59.872 --> 09:05.962
what they'd feel like wrapped
around one's shoulders.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.464
Sorry, what was the question?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.258
Why does everyone
want boys to act

09:10.341 --> 09:12.134
{\an1}like well-behaved
little girls?

09:12.218 --> 09:13.636
Pete's right.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.596
{\an3}I have a purse full of pills
the pediatrician wants me

09:15.680 --> 09:16.847
to give Aiden.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.267
{\an3}But I'm not gonna give
my kid Adderall.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.769
Adderall, you say?

09:21.852 --> 09:25.481
Isn't that what college kids
take to stay up all night?

09:25.564 --> 09:27.275
This is a waste of time.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.151
I say we just let the kids
work it out for themselves.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.987
Oh, so you plan to do nothing?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.364
You're happy to just let
your evil spawn continue

09:33.447 --> 09:34.490
to bully my grandson?

09:34.573 --> 09:35.825
Let's go, Pete.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.327
{\an3}Oh, that's great.
Just walk away.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.329
{\an3}Just know that if your little
thug lays another hand

09:40.413 --> 09:41.956
on my sweet grandchild--

09:42.039 --> 09:43.916
- Control your wife, Bob.
- We're not a couple.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.919
- I'm not his wife.
- Not yet.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.841
What are you doing?
How is that helpful?

09:51.924 --> 09:52.675
Oh, Joy, calm down.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.553
[both gasp]

09:55.636 --> 09:57.847
Oh, my God.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.683
{\an1}Did you just ask a woman
to calm down?

10:00.766 --> 10:03.728
I don't remember.
I--I don't think so.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.191
Look, I think we should go back
to my plan of Wilbur

10:09.275 --> 10:10.401
defending himself.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.820
{\an1}I already told you--
I don't want that.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.905
{\an1}Look, we should just sit down
together and talk through this.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.657
{\an3}But we're not together.
We're not a couple.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.577
{\an3}I can't make it any more clear.
There is no "we," Bob.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.620
And there never will be.

10:24.623 --> 10:26.834
{\an1}Okay.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.003
But that doesn't stop me
from caring about Wilbur.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.047
That's sweet.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.968
{\an3}When it comes to us,
you have got to move on.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.888
I hear you.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.682
{\an1}Maybe I ought to head up
to Canada for a couple of days.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.226
Take some walks in the woods.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.103
Tap a few trees.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.532
{\an3}Mmm.

10:58.616 --> 11:03.037
{\an3}I am much better at Kahlua
than I am at Words with Friends.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.456
And the great thing about our
Kahlua is I don't feel drunk,

11:05.539 --> 11:07.875
{\an3}because you put
extra coffee in it.

11:07.958 --> 11:11.337
And I don't feel wired because
we put extra vodka in it.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.800
{\an3}Oh, poor Wilbur,
being bullied.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.552
{\an3}You know, I had a bully
when I was a kid.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.888
Kaylin Boosalis.

11:20.971 --> 11:26.143
I had a bully too.
Adolf Hitler.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.646
{\an3}You know, I am two Kahluas away
from calling that jerk

11:28.729 --> 11:30.773
{\an3}and giving her
a piece of my mind.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.317
{\an3}In gym class, she used to steal
the basketball away from me

11:33.401 --> 11:34.652
and bounce it off my head.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.487
It was the worst.

11:36.570 --> 11:40.616
Did you not hear me say
my bully was Hitler?

11:44.203 --> 11:47.289
{\an1}Hey!
You're still up.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.291
{\an3}Victoria, are you just getting
back from your date with Barney?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.543
Oh, it was great.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.086
{\an1}We went to see a band,
and then we danced,

11:52.169 --> 11:55.798
and then we walked home
instead of taking a cab.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.591
{\an3}Where did all this energy
come from?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.635
Oh, Barney makes me feel young.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.930
{\an1}I'm exercising now, so I have
my own natural reserves.

12:03.013 --> 12:06.809
{\an1}Plus, I stole Adderall
out of that bully mom's purse.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.810
{\an3}What?

12:07.893 --> 12:09.270
You stole her pills?

12:09.353 --> 12:10.688
Honey, that's not
what they're for.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.523
Elka, can you believe this?

12:12.606 --> 12:18.112
{\an1}All I got was a Starbucks card
from the dad's coat.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.823
{\an3}Why are you guys stealing
from our guests?

12:20.906 --> 12:26.787
{\an1}Because they didn't bring
a hostess gift.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.165
Victoria, you should not need
pills to keep up

12:29.248 --> 12:30.374
with your boyfriend.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.667
He should love you
for who you are.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.002
Oh, grow up, Melanie.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.505
Nobody loves anybody
for who they are.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.424
These pills are the only thing
keeping me going.

12:38.507 --> 12:43.137
But I've only got one left,
and I need it to get upstairs.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.680
What am I gonna do?

12:44.763 --> 12:46.891
I need to get more Adderall
so that I can make it

12:46.974 --> 12:48.684
through Barney's
birthday party.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.144
See, he's the first one
in our group turning 30,

12:50.227 --> 12:53.189
so it's a big one.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.568
{\an3}Oh, Joy, honey, I'm sorry.
Did we get you up?

12:57.651 --> 13:00.905
No, I couldn't sleep.
Just feeling anxious.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.323
About Wilbur?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.867
{\an1}No, I'm gonna talk
to his teacher tomorrow.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.535
{\an3}Honey, why do you keep
checking your phone?

13:06.619 --> 13:09.205
{\an1}Well, Bob usually texts me
at night.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.998
{\an1}He lays out
three pairs of pajamas,

13:11.081 --> 13:13.375
and I pick the ones I like.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.710
I mean, I'm glad he stopped.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.921
{\an1}It's just weird
not to get the text.

13:17.004 --> 13:22.051
It's a little weird
either way.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.428
Just admit it.
You miss Bob.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.056
{\an1}It's not that.
I'm just used to him.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.265
{\an1}But I don't want
to think about Bob.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.100
{\an1}I should be concentrating
on Wilbur.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.102
You know
what might be helpful?

13:32.186 --> 13:34.897
Getting a prescription
for Wilbur for Adderall.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.106
{\an1}What?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.608
I wouldn't give him Adderall.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.777
Oh, and I wouldn't
want you to.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.536
And the bully is Aiden.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.371
I'm not surprised.

13:50.454 --> 13:54.542
{\an3}That kid's a soul patch away
from getting expelled.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.293
So what do we do?

13:56.377 --> 13:57.920
The school has a whole process.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.130
Witness reports, evaluations.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.549
{\an3}I gotta tell you--
it could take weeks.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.885
- Weeks?
- I'll go get the forms.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.281
{\an1}Wilbur?
Did you throw that snowball?

14:25.364 --> 14:27.616
You're not supposed to let
people know your strength.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.076
What?

14:29.159 --> 14:32.454
When you lose your temper,
you can really hurt people.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.498
{\an1}Now I want you to promise
never to do it again.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.001
{\an1}And shake on it.
Aww!

14:37.084 --> 14:40.546
{\an1}Too hard.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.256
{\an1}You know the doctor said
those gamma rays

14:42.339 --> 14:44.008
made you super strong.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.176
Is Wilbur the Hulk?

14:46.260 --> 14:50.973
{\an1}I'm not allowed to say.
But yes.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.892
Just don't make him angry.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.652
{\an3}Oh.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.655
{\an3}All right.
Enough of that, you go play.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.670
Thank you guys for coming
to my birthday.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.715
And thank you, Victoria,
for making this happen.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.176
Being with you makes me
so happy.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.804
And being with you makes me
so...tired.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.352
You passed out
in the birthday cake?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.187
Oh, it was awful.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.564
{\an3}Just as I was thinking, "This is
one of the worst moments

15:40.648 --> 15:42.733
{\an3}of my life,"
the waitress asked me

15:42.816 --> 15:47.237
{\an3}if I'd be paying
for my son's birthday party.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.239
Oh, I'm sorry...

15:49.323 --> 15:51.492
I wasn't there.

15:54.161 --> 15:54.995
So you broke up with Barney?

15:55.079 --> 15:56.872
{\an3}Yeah.

15:56.955 --> 15:59.875
{\an3}I mean, dating a younger guy
is like driving a convertible.

15:59.958 --> 16:02.378
{\an3}It's fun at first, but then
you realize your hair is a mess,

16:02.461 --> 16:06.507
you're sun burnt, and everyone
assumes you rented it anyway.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.678
{\an1}Hey, Joy.
Where you been?

16:10.761 --> 16:12.846
Out driving around.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.517
Trying to sort through
some feelings.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.229
I saw it.
I saw the aura.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.231
I think I'm in love
with Bob.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.233
What changed things?

16:24.316 --> 16:26.235
He clobbered a seven-year-old
with a snowball

16:26.318 --> 16:29.363
to protect Wilbur.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.574
It was the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.245
- Is the kid hurt?
- Who cares?

16:36.328 --> 16:37.746
I'm in love.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.289
And I'm finally seeing
what everyone else

16:39.373 --> 16:40.916
was already seeing.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.876
We're a couple.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.046
I used to think,
"He's not Simon. He's not Mitch.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.589
[flatly]
He's Bob."

16:47.673 --> 16:50.926
But now I think,
"He's not Simon. He's not Mitch.

16:51.009 --> 16:54.263
[softly]
He's Bob."

16:54.346 --> 16:57.558
{\an3}[snoring]

16:57.641 --> 17:00.686
{\an1}She is so gonna say
"aw" when she wakes up.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.941
{\an1}Oh, Bob.

17:06.023 --> 17:08.569
I'm so glad you're here.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.820
Joy, this is a surprise.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.115
{\an3}There's so much
I need to tell you.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.282
I was at the school today,

17:14.366 --> 17:15.909
{\an3}and I saw what you did
for Wilbur.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.828
{\an1}Oh.
I'm sorry.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.454
{\an1}I know you told me to butt out,
but it's just...

17:19.538 --> 17:21.080
{\an1}he was on my mind the whole time
I was in Canada and I just--

17:21.165 --> 17:23.666
{\an3}No, no.
No, I loved it.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.295
{\an3}And I'm sorry about
what I said the other night.

17:26.377 --> 17:29.631
{\an1}Joy, you never need
to apologize to me for anything.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.259
{\an1}Sure, I cried
a few manly tears at first,

17:32.342 --> 17:36.180
{\an1}but...then in
the bracing Saskatchewan cold,

17:36.263 --> 17:38.474
who should I run into
but my old girlfriend?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.350
{\an1}Canadian Joy.
She--

17:40.434 --> 17:42.644
{\an1}Oh.
Sorry to interrupt.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.813
No, not at all.
You two should meet.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.857
Joy, Joy.
Joy, Joy.

17:46.940 --> 17:50.194
- Joy.
- Joy.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.654
{\an1}Hey, babe, I couldn't get
the vending machine to work.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.823
Ah, that machine
is temperamental.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.116
That's why I treat it
like a woman.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.661
Just keep putting money into it
till it gives me what I want.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.623
He's funny.

18:02.706 --> 18:06.293
Cut the crap, Cleveland Joy.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.504
I know you want him,
but he's mine.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.506
You make one move on him,
and I'll chop you up

18:10.589 --> 18:13.342
and feed you to my sled dogs.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.010
{\an1}(Bob)
Damn, my hand is stuck.

18:15.093 --> 18:18.055
Be right there, Bob.
Isn't he cutest?

18:18.138 --> 18:20.808
[whispers]
Say yes and I'll kill you.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.862
{\an3}Well, that's the last
of the Kahlua.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.905
Should we make some more?

18:34.988 --> 18:36.573
Oh, I don't know.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.992
I drunk dialed my old bully
last night

18:39.076 --> 18:41.370
and left a long
and rambling message.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.039
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
Maybe she didn't get it.

18:44.122 --> 18:46.333
{\an5}(Kaylin)
Hey, Melanie.
Are you in there?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.836
{\an1}It's her.
It's my bully.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.421
I guess she got it.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.347
Melanie.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.063
Hi.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.232
Hi, Kaylin.
What a surprise.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.235
Well, I got your message,
and so I asked my pilot

19:13.318 --> 19:14.903
to stop here
on my way to New York.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.446
{\an1}Your pilot?
What, you have a plane?

19:16.530 --> 19:18.782
{\an3}Well, two.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.576
I am uber successful.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.537
Because I created Uber.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.415
This is for you.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.250
{\an1}You're not gonna hit me with it,
are ya?

19:28.333 --> 19:29.585
{\an3}Of course not.
Think fast!

19:29.668 --> 19:32.462
{\an1}Oh, God!

19:32.546 --> 19:35.966
{\an3}Oh, nobody ever flinched
like you, Moretti.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.093
{\an3}It's a gift for you signed
by the basketball team I own.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.845
Oh, well, okay,

19:39.928 --> 19:42.973
{\an1}so it's an apology gift
for the way you treated me.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.392
{\an3}No, no.
It's more like a thank-you.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.436
{\an3}You taught me how great it feels
to intimidate

19:47.519 --> 19:51.940
even the most likable person.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.068
You're the reason
I'm so successful.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.570
Now give me a hug.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.946
{\an1}Oh, no.
No, I'm not--not gonna hug you.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.783
- I said a hug.
- Okay.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.329
{\an3}Wow.
You got boobs.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.538
Never thought
that was gonna happen.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.128
{\an1}Well,
guess I got my apology.

20:13.211 --> 20:16.590
Is that what happened?

20:16.673 --> 20:18.175
{\an1}Yeah, that's how I choose
to look at it.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.802
{\an1}I choose to see the glass
as half full.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.096
Not for long.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.270
