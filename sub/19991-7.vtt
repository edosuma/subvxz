<i>- We interrupt this program</i>

01:03.629 --> 01:07.731
<i>to bring you</i>
<i>a Bikini Bottom News Flash.</i>

01:07.733 --> 01:08.932
- Whoa, big fella.

01:08.934 --> 01:10.801
- Mr. Plankton,
we've received word

01:10.803 --> 01:13.470
that you're plotting
to infiltrate the Krusty Krab

01:13.472 --> 01:16.506
and steal the Krabby Patty
secret formula.

01:16.508 --> 01:17.641
Is that true?

01:17.643 --> 01:19.676
- Actually, yes, that is true.

01:19.678 --> 01:20.944
I've got it all worked out.

01:20.946 --> 01:24.514
First I break into the safe
and--ehh.

01:24.516 --> 01:26.783
Wait, is this live?

01:26.785 --> 01:29.186
- Yes.

01:29.188 --> 01:32.355
- Don't broadcast
my secret plans!

01:32.357 --> 01:34.791
They're secret!

01:34.793 --> 01:38.195
I will destroy
all of you!

01:39.798 --> 01:43.500
Secret formula, ho!

01:45.637 --> 01:48.905
- I reckon that classified
taste mixture

01:48.907 --> 01:51.842
will be in my hands directly.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.987
Ow!

02:05.591 --> 02:06.423
The fool!

02:06.425 --> 02:09.559
He left the safe open.

02:13.264 --> 02:16.433
Open for business, baby!

02:23.642 --> 02:25.909
Gotcha.

02:38.457 --> 02:42.559
I'm off to make a delivery.

02:42.561 --> 02:45.462
- Ha, that fool.

02:53.838 --> 02:59.276
And the Krabby Patty
is made of...

02:59.278 --> 03:00.043
urchins!

03:00.045 --> 03:01.378
- Ew! Ew!

03:01.380 --> 03:04.614
-<i> Gotcha!</i>

03:07.786 --> 03:08.785
Yoink!

03:08.787 --> 03:09.486
- Huh?

03:09.488 --> 03:12.022
Yes!

03:12.024 --> 03:13.590
- Pull!

03:13.592 --> 03:14.991
Yee-haw!

03:24.937 --> 03:27.003
- Gotcha!

03:46.023 --> 03:49.059
Gotcha.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.831
- Alley-oop!

04:01.740 --> 04:03.773
- Whee!

04:03.775 --> 04:07.510
Come to daddy, patty!

04:13.952 --> 04:15.652
- Gotcha.

04:20.524 --> 04:21.524
- Eeh.

04:29.767 --> 04:32.068
Oh, Karen,
he covered me in urchins,

04:32.070 --> 04:34.904
fed me to a seahorse,
and stung me to death.

04:34.906 --> 04:37.474
I fly through the air,
he flies through the air.

04:37.476 --> 04:40.543
I hide in a stomach,
he hides in a stomach.

04:40.545 --> 04:42.612
I have had enough!

04:42.614 --> 04:47.417
- Oh, I think someone needs
their ba-ba.

04:47.419 --> 04:50.553
There, isn't that better?

04:50.555 --> 04:51.388
- No, Karen!

04:51.390 --> 04:54.424
That's just not gonna
work anymore!

04:54.426 --> 04:57.627
Don't you see?
We're done here.

04:57.629 --> 05:00.096
- He said for
the 9 billionth time.

05:00.098 --> 05:01.898
You know, Sheldon,
if I had a dime

05:01.900 --> 05:05.702
for every time you--

05:33.731 --> 05:35.899
- Mr. Krabs,
did you see that?

05:35.901 --> 05:37.033
Plankton is retiring.

05:37.035 --> 05:40.537
- I'll believes it
when I sees it.

05:50.981 --> 05:53.950
Hey, ha ha!

05:54.552 --> 05:56.486
All hands on deck,
SpongeBob!

05:56.488 --> 05:58.555
Aye-aye, Mr--whoa!

05:58.557 --> 06:00.156
Oh-oh-oh!

06:00.859 --> 06:03.727
- Aw, you want to say
good-bye to Plankton,

06:03.729 --> 06:04.894
you old softy you.

06:04.896 --> 06:05.895
- That'll be the day.

06:05.897 --> 06:08.765
I don't trust Plankton
as far as I throw him.

06:08.767 --> 06:11.701
That's why we're gonna
shadow that little twit

06:11.703 --> 06:14.671
and find out what he's up to.

06:20.978 --> 06:24.614
- "Welcome to Dullsville:
a charmingly boring--"

06:24.616 --> 06:28.952
- Snap your trap, boy-o.
You'll blow our cover.

06:30.921 --> 06:33.923
- A new life in a new town.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.535
- I still don't see Plankton
doing anything wrong.

06:45.537 --> 06:47.137
Maybe he really is retiring.

06:47.139 --> 06:50.940
- Believes it
when I sees it.

07:01.787 --> 07:05.155
- Quick, boy,
he's getting away.

07:17.035 --> 07:20.003
- Yes?
- I'd like a room, please.

07:20.005 --> 07:22.572
- Very good, sir.

07:22.574 --> 07:25.608
- How long will you be
staying with us?

07:30.781 --> 07:31.881
Forever.

07:31.883 --> 07:33.716
Ahhh!

07:45.162 --> 07:49.299
And so begins my retirement.

07:51.136 --> 07:54.170
- You see you, lad.
Plankton is up to no good.

07:54.172 --> 07:58.141
I bet those are all the fixings
for another evil lab.

07:58.143 --> 08:00.977
- Mr. Krabs,
I'm gonna be sick.

08:02.247 --> 08:03.780
Yes.

08:03.782 --> 08:04.714
Yes!

08:04.716 --> 08:09.586
- You see, he's got an evil belt
to match those evil shoes.

08:17.595 --> 08:18.628
- Yes!

08:18.630 --> 08:21.764
My plan is almost complete.

08:22.934 --> 08:25.768
- His plan!
Did you hear that, SpongeBob?

08:25.770 --> 08:26.736
He said plan!

08:26.738 --> 08:30.073
- Uh, please, don't shake me,
Mr. Krabs.

08:30.075 --> 08:31.741
- Oh, my pretty.

08:31.743 --> 08:35.378
You'll be my best friend
from now on.

08:36.214 --> 08:38.248
Retirement is mine.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.115
Mine.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.851
Mine!

08:41.852 --> 08:42.952
- Ooh, this is it, boy-o.

08:42.953 --> 08:45.922
He's got an evil laser
death apparatus contraption

08:45.924 --> 08:47.724
ready to spring on all of us.

08:54.633 --> 08:55.999
- Ooh.

08:58.703 --> 09:01.104
Now that I sees it,
I believes it.

09:01.106 --> 09:06.209
- Hurray! I knew you'd
get it, Mr. Krabs.

09:08.747 --> 09:09.279
- Krabs!

09:09.281 --> 09:12.649
What are you doing
in my hotel room?

09:15.020 --> 09:15.485
Oh.

09:15.487 --> 09:17.787
Good luck on your retirement,
Plankton.

09:17.789 --> 09:19.956
I won't give you
any more trouble.

09:19.958 --> 09:21.658
- Oh, I know you won't, Krabs,

09:21.660 --> 09:24.727
because I'm at
the Krusty Krab right now

09:24.729 --> 09:26.129
stealing that formula.

09:26.131 --> 09:28.898
- Oh-oh, sure.
Whatever you say, old-timer.

09:28.900 --> 09:32.235
How would you be doing that when
you're all the way over here

09:32.237 --> 09:34.671
in Dullsville, hmm?

09:36.241 --> 09:40.777
Because I'm a decoy
look-alike robot!

09:40.779 --> 09:43.746
Gotcha!

09:43.748 --> 09:46.182
So what'd I miss?

09:46.184 --> 09:47.150
What?

09:47.152 --> 09:48.151
- That's right, Karen.

09:48.153 --> 09:50.987
By the time those two
knuckleheads figure it out,

09:50.989 --> 09:54.324
I'll be knee-deep
in secret formula.

09:54.326 --> 09:57.961
Yes, I'll wear my galoshes.
Gotta go.

10:00.031 --> 10:02.465
In your face, Krabs.

10:02.467 --> 10:03.967
Ha!

10:11.376 --> 10:13.843
Krabs?
SpongeBoob?

10:13.845 --> 10:16.112
Why aren't you in Dullsville?

10:16.114 --> 10:17.714
- We never left, Sheldon.

10:17.716 --> 10:21.284
The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob
who followed the robot you

10:21.286 --> 10:25.722
to Dullsville
were also robots.

10:25.724 --> 10:28.257
Gotcha.

10:28.259 --> 10:30.994
Hate! Hate!

10:30.996 --> 10:34.430
Hate! Hate! Hate!
Hate! Hate!

10:36.300 --> 10:38.468
- So the way I see it,
Mr. Krabs and Plankton

10:38.470 --> 10:43.873
are just using us as pawns in
their dumb secret formula war.

10:43.875 --> 10:44.507
- Agreed.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.943
- Yeah, I mean,
who cares if that guy

10:46.945 --> 10:49.212
steals the secret
formula anyway?

10:49.214 --> 10:51.881
Grow up, that's what I say.

10:51.883 --> 10:53.416
- Agreed.

10:53.817 --> 10:58.054
- So you're the real
Krabs and SpongeBob.

10:58.056 --> 10:58.955
Gimme that!

10:58.957 --> 11:00.289
- Ooh.

11:12.136 --> 11:13.770
- Yello.

11:13.772 --> 11:15.004
Krusty Krab,
may I take your order?

11:15.006 --> 11:17.473
No, Mr. Krabs is unable
to come to the phone right now.

11:17.475 --> 11:19.342
He's trapped in
a dust cloud brawl.

11:19.344 --> 11:21.010
Yeah, he'll have
to call you back.

11:21.012 --> 11:23.846
Gee, I hope our
robot look-alikes are okay.

11:23.848 --> 11:26.449
Bless their heart-like
pneumatic pumps.

11:42.232 --> 11:44.801
Yay!

11:47.571 --> 11:48.471
Behold!

11:48.473 --> 11:50.106
We are the Greek chorus.

11:50.108 --> 11:52.975
We narrate this epic tale

11:52.977 --> 11:55.244
of stupidity.

12:05.223 --> 12:07.323
Behold Neptune,

12:07.325 --> 12:09.125
god of the sea,

12:09.127 --> 12:11.594
with his mighty trident,

12:11.596 --> 12:13.930
a weapon so powerful

12:13.932 --> 12:17.967
nothing is beyond
its user's reach.

12:17.969 --> 12:20.603
Behold the Kraken.

12:24.109 --> 12:26.409
Gross monster.

12:39.491 --> 12:42.725
Behold Neptune triumphant.

12:42.727 --> 12:45.628
What an awesome dude.

12:45.630 --> 12:49.298
Behold this idiot
and beware,

12:49.300 --> 12:53.169
for trident trouble comes.

12:53.171 --> 12:55.338
- Sorry.
- Eh.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.306
See?

12:58.475 --> 13:01.043
Food! Food! Food!

13:01.045 --> 13:02.578
Food! Food!

13:02.580 --> 13:04.280
- Food! Food!

13:04.282 --> 13:04.714
Oh.

13:04.716 --> 13:07.483
- Hey, I was still
reading that!

13:10.021 --> 13:11.287
- Forget the stupid comic.

13:11.289 --> 13:12.488
We've got a situation here.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.123
We don't have
any Krabby Patties,

13:14.125 --> 13:17.760
and these animals are trying
to eat us instead.

13:18.429 --> 13:22.465
Hey, who's responsible
for this?

13:24.168 --> 13:26.736
- Get to flipping
those patties fast, boy-o!

13:26.738 --> 13:29.372
Before we all become
the lunch special.

13:29.374 --> 13:31.607
- I'm on it, Mr. Krabs.

13:41.652 --> 13:43.486
Oh, the toppings
haven't been prepped.

13:43.488 --> 13:48.024
I wish this lettuce and tomato
would just cut themselves up.

13:49.626 --> 13:50.693
- Let's do this!

13:50.695 --> 13:53.629
- Yeah, cut me up good,
girlfriend.

13:53.631 --> 13:57.099
- Huh.

13:57.101 --> 13:59.669
I guess I did cut up
the toppings after all.

13:59.671 --> 14:01.404
- 37 Krabby Patties!

14:01.406 --> 14:03.806
Fast!
Ahhh!

14:03.808 --> 14:04.774
- 37 patties?

14:04.776 --> 14:06.576
How am I gonna flip 37 patties?

14:06.578 --> 14:10.112
Huh, has my spatula
always had three heads?

14:10.114 --> 14:11.180
No!

14:11.182 --> 14:13.349
And it is not a spatula.

14:13.351 --> 14:17.253
- Get them patties
out here fast, SpongeBob!

14:17.255 --> 14:18.454
Ahh!

14:18.456 --> 14:19.722
- Well, I wish
these Krabby Patties

14:19.724 --> 14:23.759
would just serve themselves
so I could keep cooking.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.263
- Hey!

14:27.265 --> 14:28.664
- Yay!

14:28.666 --> 14:29.498
- Yeah!

14:30.335 --> 14:33.536
- Whoa, my spatula
never did that before.

14:33.538 --> 14:36.072
Krabby Patty!
Krabby Patty!

14:36.074 --> 14:38.841
Krabby Patty!
Krabby Patty!

14:39.844 --> 14:42.245
Huh?

14:55.225 --> 14:56.292
- Mmm.

14:56.294 --> 14:57.560
- Huh?

14:58.563 --> 15:01.163
I don't know how
you're doing this, boy-o,

15:01.165 --> 15:01.898
but keep it up.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.733
Folks will pay
every cent they have

15:03.735 --> 15:05.401
to watch Krabby Patties dance.

15:05.403 --> 15:07.503
Look at how cute they are.

15:07.505 --> 15:08.671
- Hey.
- Oh!

15:08.673 --> 15:10.673
- Whoo!
- Whoo-whee!

15:10.675 --> 15:13.276
- We're running out
of them dancing patties.

15:13.278 --> 15:15.678
Faster, boy-o!
Faster!

15:18.316 --> 15:20.583
Dance!
Come on, dance!

15:20.585 --> 15:23.619
I'm trying, Mr. Krabs.
I'm trying.

15:23.621 --> 15:25.688
Come on, you, work!

15:29.593 --> 15:33.229
The sponge has angered
the trident.

15:33.231 --> 15:35.398
Trouble comes.

15:41.538 --> 15:45.274
- Ahh!

15:45.276 --> 15:47.877
- Ah.

15:52.383 --> 15:53.282
Ahh!

16:00.590 --> 16:01.557
- No!

16:01.559 --> 16:03.159
This is gonna
cost me money!

16:03.161 --> 16:06.729
- Mr. Krabs, I wish
you wouldn't worry about money

16:06.731 --> 16:08.497
at a time like this.

16:10.635 --> 16:13.336
Right you are, boy-o.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.441
Here, take this.
Here you go.

16:18.443 --> 16:20.242
I can't stop!

16:20.912 --> 16:23.579
- There you go.
What's happening to me!

16:23.581 --> 16:27.283
- What is going on
around here?

16:27.285 --> 16:28.951
- Ahem.

16:28.953 --> 16:33.255
- Hey, what's this?

16:33.257 --> 16:34.357
Whoa!

16:34.359 --> 16:36.525
My spatula is magic.

16:36.527 --> 16:39.829
Magic, magic, magic.

16:39.831 --> 16:40.696
- This is awesome.

16:40.698 --> 16:45.735
I will use this magic spatula
to help everyone.

16:52.543 --> 16:54.910
- I'll have two, please.

16:57.882 --> 17:00.616
I'll help you, baby!

17:00.618 --> 17:01.684
Boing!

17:10.694 --> 17:14.296
- What's wrong, grass?
Why won't you grow?

17:14.298 --> 17:16.699
Talk to me.

17:20.704 --> 17:23.372
Oh.
Mm.

17:27.444 --> 17:30.379
- We'll do more than just
talk to yous.

17:30.381 --> 17:33.582
Let's see how you like
getting mowed.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.718
- Ahhh!

17:38.789 --> 17:40.589
- There is no problem
I cannot solve,

17:40.591 --> 17:44.460
for I am SpongeBob,
Emperor of the Sea.

17:46.831 --> 17:50.599
Hey, get outta here,
you pesky jellyfish!

17:50.601 --> 17:52.935
Whoa, slow your roll.

17:52.937 --> 17:56.806
Only Neptune,
true ruler of the sea,

17:56.808 --> 17:59.875
can control the trident.

18:02.046 --> 18:03.879
- So I say, "Look, Zeus,

18:03.881 --> 18:06.282
"either you come up
with more money

18:06.284 --> 18:08.017
or Neptune walks."

18:11.322 --> 18:12.354
- There he is, ma.

18:12.356 --> 18:14.790
That's the man who hit me.

18:16.494 --> 18:18.694
- Don't cry, baby.

18:18.696 --> 18:20.996
Mother will handle this.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.768
- Let us battle!

18:25.770 --> 18:27.937
Take that!

18:27.939 --> 18:30.339
- Huh?

18:30.574 --> 18:34.543
This is dry-clean only,
you monster!

18:34.545 --> 18:35.845
- Ooh.
Huh?

18:35.847 --> 18:39.381
"Property of SpongeBob"?

18:41.586 --> 18:42.818
- Uh-oh.

18:49.559 --> 18:50.893
- Hey, SpongeBob.

18:50.895 --> 18:53.362
You look so sparkly today.

18:53.364 --> 18:56.365
- Of course I do,
for I am SpongeBob,

18:56.367 --> 18:57.766
Emperor of the Sea.

18:59.704 --> 19:01.003
- Oh.

19:01.938 --> 19:04.340
No!
My ice cream!

19:04.342 --> 19:08.944
Ohh, why is the world
so full of pain?

19:11.649 --> 19:13.349
- Fear not,
bestest of friends.

19:13.351 --> 19:15.584
You shall have all the ice cream
you could ever eat.

19:15.586 --> 19:19.922
No, you'll only
make it worse.

19:22.994 --> 19:26.929
- Ahhh!
Best day ever!

19:26.931 --> 19:29.365
- No, worst day ever.

19:29.367 --> 19:30.432
Oh, my back.

19:30.434 --> 19:31.567
See?

19:31.569 --> 19:34.069
- I can fix this.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.842
- Hooray!

19:39.844 --> 19:40.509
- Boo!

19:40.511 --> 19:43.512
- I think I know a way
to make you both happy.

19:43.514 --> 19:45.047
You really don't.

19:45.049 --> 19:48.717
How do you not
get that by now?

19:51.588 --> 19:55.724
- An ice cream geyser!

19:57.994 --> 19:59.962
Ahh!

20:06.636 --> 20:07.970
Brain freeze!

20:07.972 --> 20:09.138
I can't eat it all.

20:09.140 --> 20:15.144
Ah, I've never been
more disappointed in myself.

20:20.484 --> 20:22.618
- Ooh, I like choc--

20:22.620 --> 20:26.188
- Oh, the creamy,
delicious horror.

20:26.523 --> 20:28.457
- Save us, SpongeBob!

20:28.459 --> 20:29.525
Save us!

20:29.527 --> 20:31.994
No wait.

20:31.996 --> 20:33.495
Okay, now save us!

20:33.497 --> 20:37.666
- Stop, ice cream!
Stop! Stop!

20:37.668 --> 20:38.701
- Hmm?

20:41.005 --> 20:42.871
- Oh, I just made it worse.

20:42.873 --> 20:44.974
Patrick,
I've ruined everything.

20:44.976 --> 20:49.144
- Oh, SpongeBob,
I wouldn't say that.

20:49.146 --> 20:50.446
- Our baby!

20:50.448 --> 20:52.047
- I'll never mow you again!

20:52.049 --> 20:54.550
- Take me money!
- Ow!

20:54.552 --> 20:57.786
Okay, SpongeBob,
you ruined everything.

20:57.788 --> 21:00.623
- No sponge should have
this much power.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.591
We told you so.

21:02.593 --> 21:03.459
- Not helping.

21:03.461 --> 21:04.927
- Well, maybe I can help.

21:04.929 --> 21:07.663
I believe I have
something of yours.

21:07.665 --> 21:09.098
- My spatula!

21:09.100 --> 21:10.599
Then what's this?

21:10.601 --> 21:11.900
- That is my trident!

21:11.902 --> 21:15.771
- Well, take your trident.
I don't want it anymore.

21:15.773 --> 21:17.840
Whoa! Stop!
That wasn't me.

21:17.842 --> 21:21.543
Too long away
from its true master,

21:21.545 --> 21:23.846
the trident has run wild.

21:23.848 --> 21:25.481
- What a jerk.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.684
- Sorry.
Pardon me.

21:28.686 --> 21:30.586
It stuck!

21:31.989 --> 21:35.591
- Ahh!
Make it stop!

21:43.734 --> 21:47.636
- You have been
one naughty trident.

21:48.306 --> 21:52.641
- Oh, I can't stay
mad at you.

21:53.311 --> 21:57.546
- Now let's see if we can
fix all of this.

22:02.719 --> 22:03.952
- Give me back me money.

22:07.625 --> 22:10.225
- Mow us good!

22:10.994 --> 22:15.264
- You know, SpongeBob,
your spatula is just as powerful

22:15.266 --> 22:16.899
as my trident.

22:16.901 --> 22:18.100
- Really?

22:18.102 --> 22:20.703
- Ha!
Not even close!

22:21.272 --> 22:23.005
But it's still pretty great.

22:23.007 --> 22:24.573
- Thanks for bailing me out,
Neptune.

22:24.575 --> 22:26.608
If there's any way
I can ever help you,

22:26.610 --> 22:27.643
just let me know.

22:27.645 --> 22:31.046
- Well, there is one way.

22:31.048 --> 22:32.848
There they are!

22:35.720 --> 22:37.720
- Let's get 'em!
