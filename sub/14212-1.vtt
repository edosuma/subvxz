Thanks

Can you read it?

04:14.780 --> 04:15.731
What?

04:16.545 --> 04:17.995
Don't pretend

04:30.630 --> 04:33.189
Hi Tom, how are you!

04:33.209 --> 04:34.488
Hi, Russ

04:39.110 --> 04:40.096
Thanks

04:40.410 --> 04:41.587
That's it!

04:47.731 --> 04:49.770
That's great, first class

05:04.407 --> 05:06.473
Why don't we go out
for a drink sometimes

05:22.850 --> 05:24.820
It's pleasure doing business with you

05:31.913 --> 05:33.240
Good!

05:33.260 --> 05:35.010
Your English is improved

05:35.030 --> 05:36.710
Even know 'of course'

05:36.730 --> 05:37.742
Of course!

05:40.770 --> 05:41.580
Good morning. Mark

05:41.600 --> 05:42.080
Good morning, Mr. Sung

05:42.100 --> 05:42.980
Good morning

05:44.370 --> 05:47.830
Good morning, Mr. Sung

05:50.140 --> 05:51.060
Good morning, Mark

05:51.080 --> 05:53.177
That's good

05:56.820 --> 05:57.704
Mr. Yiu

05:57.841 --> 06:00.605
Ho, you are back!
Everything OK?

06:00.625 --> 06:01.520
I counted already

06:01.540 --> 06:02.370
Clever

06:02.390 --> 06:04.137
Those foreigners are easy going

06:04.157 --> 06:05.840
Not all of them are as good as they are

06:05.860 --> 06:08.930
Your weakness is too easy
to believe someone

06:09.532 --> 06:10.244
Thanks!

06:10.264 --> 06:12.187
You are Shing? Sit...

06:12.370 --> 06:14.253
No, thanks
It's better for me to stand

06:19.070 --> 06:20.444
Good morning. Linda!

06:26.541 --> 06:28.340
Rose!

06:29.120 --> 06:31.870
There's a lot
you can learn from Ho

06:31.890 --> 06:33.840
He's excellent

06:33.860 --> 06:37.959
But I'll never be as good as him

06:39.330 --> 06:40.940
Though Mark is frivolous

06:40.960 --> 06:42.585
But he is loyal

06:42.605 --> 06:44.226
Yes, he takes good care of me

06:44.246 --> 06:45.420
What are you talking about?

06:45.440 --> 06:47.420
Nothing
Just talking about you!

06:47.440 --> 06:48.502
Really?

06:49.570 --> 06:52.018
Your brother, Kit
graduates today

06:52.710 --> 06:56.560
Oh! Yes
I forgot to buy him a present

06:56.580 --> 06:58.158
I've got to go now

06:58.650 --> 07:03.970
Ho. Take Shing with you
tomorrow to Taiwan

07:03.990 --> 07:06.293
Give the kid a chance

07:09.320 --> 07:10.710
Taiwan
Don't mistake it with Chai Wan?

07:10.730 --> 07:13.090
Though I've been in this field for years
I'm still afraid to go

07:13.110 --> 07:13.880
Do you know why?

07:13.900 --> 07:15.310
Too much fighting

07:15.330 --> 07:16.800
and drink

07:16.820 --> 07:18.410
Don't fool him

07:18.430 --> 07:19.480
OK

07:19.500 --> 07:21.980
Give Kit a girl
for a graduation present

07:22.000 --> 07:23.720
I'm no good
but I want him to be a good citizen

07:23.740 --> 07:25.794
But it's better to have a whore

07:27.340 --> 07:29.020
I want to see him to be a PhD

07:29.040 --> 07:30.830
Getting married

07:30.850 --> 07:32.516
And having his own baby

07:32.536 --> 07:34.698
Then you'll be as
busy as a buffalo

07:37.020 --> 07:38.330
People say, one will step on shit

07:38.350 --> 07:40.130
with a big mouth

07:40.150 --> 07:41.286
You go in first

07:42.898 --> 07:46.877
You first I won't

07:46.897 --> 07:48.560
We will go in together

08:06.810 --> 08:08.100

That's not funny

08:11.150 --> 08:12.356

08:12.620 --> 08:15.780
Both of us have guns

08:15.800 --> 08:16.376

08:16.396 --> 08:18.386

I am an Inspector, surprise!

08:37.039 --> 08:39.260

08:39.280 --> 08:41.517
At least you've got to
be a super intendant

08:42.679 --> 08:43.812
Jackie!

08:44.020 --> 08:44.900
She is my girlfriend

08:44.920 --> 08:46.108
She takes care of dad
when she has time

08:46.128 --> 08:47.539

09:00.330 --> 09:01.715
Don't mention it

09:02.100 --> 09:04.054
I've got to sit for an exam

09:05.105 --> 09:08.471
Are you going steady

09:09.380 --> 09:11.951

Dad!

09:36.840 --> 09:38.708
You should quit

09:39.770 --> 09:42.070
Your brother doesn't know
what you have been doing

09:43.340 --> 09:45.279
Still remember

09:45.550 --> 09:47.600
You two played cop & thief
when you were kids

09:47.620 --> 09:49.336
He almost lost

09:49.920 --> 09:52.196
But he still wanted to be a cop

09:52.650 --> 09:56.277
I don't want you to play
the same game again

09:57.490 --> 09:59.862

Listen. Judges

11:18.510 --> 11:19.505
Sorry

11:24.495 --> 11:27.034
It's you...
You made me so embarrassed

11:27.054 --> 11:28.833
You spoiled everything

11:28.980 --> 11:29.978
How can I help you,

11:29.998 --> 11:31.700
if you don't have
confidence yourself?

11:31.720 --> 11:32.870
They didn't say you are out

11:32.890 --> 11:34.440
How do you know you'll fail?

11:34.460 --> 11:35.814
Give it back to me

11:39.660 --> 11:41.893
I will really fail this time

11:52.422 --> 11:53.558
Are you sure?

11:54.516 --> 11:57.170
This will be my last time

12:02.296 --> 12:03.664
Because of Kit?

12:09.555 --> 12:12.250
Don't come with me
to Taiwan tomorrow

12:12.270 --> 12:15.398
Anything goes wrong, you're here

12:16.808 --> 12:18.861
Then they will follow you

12:22.459 --> 12:23.882
I can't do it

12:25.440 --> 12:27.090
Then Shing will do it

12:27.110 --> 12:28.790
He resembles Al Pacino

12:28.810 --> 12:30.433
Please don't fool me, Mark

12:31.480 --> 12:33.760
Ho, we can't do without you

12:33.780 --> 12:35.641
I'm not mature yet

12:35.661 --> 12:37.167
Don't expect too much

12:38.490 --> 12:42.286
Don't think you can be the Big Brother
by reading the books about underworld

12:44.230 --> 12:46.525
Anyone ever point a gun at you?

12:47.660 --> 12:48.577
No!

12:50.160 --> 12:52.085
12 years ago...

12:53.330 --> 12:54.570
12 years,

12:56.200 --> 12:59.058
Ho and I went to
Indonesia the first time

13:00.340 --> 13:03.119
We had a dinner at a club
with their Big Brother

13:05.610 --> 13:08.204
I said something wrong

13:08.420 --> 13:10.735
Suddenly 2 guns were
pointing at my head

13:11.490 --> 13:13.814
and I was ordered to drink
a bottle of whisky

13:15.760 --> 13:18.664
I was so scared

13:21.400 --> 13:22.840
Ho is really great

13:22.860 --> 13:24.882
He drank it for me

13:26.870 --> 13:28.880
But there was even worse

13:28.900 --> 13:30.960
4 guns were pointing at me then...

13:35.350 --> 13:37.648
Do you know what
they asked me to drink?

13:38.305 --> 13:39.947
Urine!

13:43.250 --> 13:45.509
Drank urine in the club

13:58.670 --> 14:01.513
Learning! That's what
you call learning

14:12.361 --> 14:14.728
That's our first deal

14:15.320 --> 14:18.261
That's history
Don't talk about it anymore

14:18.281 --> 14:19.635
No!

14:27.140 --> 14:29.658
Never cried since I was a kid

14:32.662 --> 14:34.975
That's the first time I cried

14:38.123 --> 14:42.638
I swore that no one would ever
point a gun at me again

15:06.521 --> 15:07.862
That's good!

15:16.180 --> 15:17.643
Be careful

15:20.050 --> 15:22.010
Hitting a sand bag more often

15:24.180 --> 15:25.566
I've to go tomorrow

15:30.020 --> 15:31.582
Regular disappear

15:33.101 --> 15:34.660
I'll be back soon

15:36.160 --> 15:39.441
When I'm away, take care of dad

15:40.002 --> 15:41.248
I will

15:43.457 --> 15:44.524
Take care!

15:45.564 --> 15:46.604
Yes!

16:34.461 --> 16:36.144
They're coming

16:40.460 --> 16:42.962
Be careful, there's
something wrong here

16:44.770 --> 16:46.050
How do you know?

16:46.070 --> 16:47.229
Intuition

16:53.073 --> 16:55.454
Mr. Sung, how are you!

16:55.474 --> 16:56.320
Where is Mr. Wang?

16:56.340 --> 16:57.830
He's not feeling well
I'm her nephew

16:57.850 --> 16:59.260
He asked me to replace him

16:59.280 --> 17:00.360
How are you!

17:00.380 --> 17:02.199
What kind of illness he has got?

17:02.219 --> 17:05.599
Mr. Sung, let's in and talk

17:05.619 --> 17:06.630
Nothing serious

17:06.650 --> 17:09.470
Just hiding out
for a while

17:09.490 --> 17:10.800
Have a cup of tea

17:10.819 --> 17:11.569
Thanks!

17:11.589 --> 17:13.910
Mr. Sung, this way please!

17:13.930 --> 17:16.609
Scared of everything
when you are getting old

17:16.630 --> 17:17.640
Please sit

17:17.660 --> 17:19.719
Don't waste time!

17:19.972 --> 17:20.849
Attention, head quarters

17:20.869 --> 17:24.400
Please check a car north
town 1086379

17:24.440 --> 17:26.718
It's a bit suspicious

17:34.250 --> 17:35.760
We know you're reliable

17:35.780 --> 17:38.919
I respected you
when I was a kid

17:39.320 --> 17:40.370
Do you believe that?

17:40.390 --> 17:42.940
Someone paid me double to kill you

17:42.960 --> 17:46.240
He's crazy, who do they think I am?

17:46.260 --> 17:47.663
I give you money

18:07.710 --> 18:08.650
Police!

19:07.840 --> 19:08.870
Hello!

19:15.780 --> 19:16.693
Uncle

19:33.400 --> 19:44.640
The boat has left, we are now miles away

19:48.280 --> 19:51.100
Sung killed some of our men in Taiwan

19:51.120 --> 19:53.349
He is wanted by the Police

19:53.369 --> 19:56.065
Big brother is worried that
Ho might talk his secret

19:56.085 --> 19:58.340
Please come with me

19:58.360 --> 20:00.519
I don't want to be rude

20:05.630 --> 20:06.450
You son of a bitch

20:06.470 --> 20:07.880
If you hurt my son

20:07.900 --> 20:09.530
I won't let you off

20:10.670 --> 20:11.697
Run!

20:11.717 --> 20:13.190
What are you doing?

20:13.210 --> 20:14.330
No!

20:22.720 --> 20:25.080
Wrong number

20:32.609 --> 20:33.745
Go. Uncle!

20:37.983 --> 20:39.078
Uncle!

20:40.639 --> 20:42.643
Jackie, what's happening?

21:32.450 --> 21:34.404
Be careful, Kit!

21:34.424 --> 21:36.945
Dad, don't come out

22:10.877 --> 22:14.051
Dad, please don't

22:33.550 --> 22:38.640
Dad!

22:39.890 --> 22:46.260
Kit, you have to forgive your brother!

23:12.931 --> 23:14.888
Who betrayed me?

23:20.460 --> 23:21.332
You?

23:21.352 --> 23:24.040
Ho, if I did

23:24.060 --> 23:26.150
I wouldn't be here with you now

23:32.170 --> 23:34.165
I don't know if I can escape this time

23:53.190 --> 23:56.290
Ho, what are you doing?

23:56.310 --> 23:57.010
I'm going to surrender

23:57.030 --> 23:57.740
You can't

23:57.760 --> 23:59.110
Please don't

23:59.130 --> 24:00.669
Please don't go

24:04.910 --> 24:06.529
No

24:06.720 --> 24:07.640
No!

24:07.660 --> 24:08.377
Run!

24:13.310 --> 24:14.180
Ho...

24:14.200 --> 24:14.910
Go away

24:15.550 --> 24:17.230
I don't want to implicate another friend

24:17.250 --> 24:18.530
There's gun shots in the cavern

24:18.550 --> 24:20.420
You go

24:20.440 --> 24:21.399
No

24:21.419 --> 24:22.850
I insist you go

24:31.300 --> 24:33.990
Stand and don't move

24:34.010 --> 24:35.377
Put down the gun

24:35.397 --> 24:38.120
Did you hear me?
Put down the gun

25:34.030 --> 25:37.440
There're no more rules in the world

25:37.460 --> 25:40.350
You can't trust any one today

25:40.370 --> 25:43.220
Even my nephew, Wang

25:43.240 --> 25:44.962
betrayed me

25:46.040 --> 25:48.190
He joined up with a new HK gang

25:48.210 --> 25:51.290
to try to take over my business

25:51.310 --> 25:55.185
As a result, we've lost Ho

25:58.080 --> 26:01.300
We respect a faithful man

26:01.320 --> 26:03.695
but not a traitor

26:06.560 --> 26:07.463
Hello!

26:08.800 --> 26:09.556
Yes!

26:12.370 --> 26:15.866
He will be in Fung Lim Restaurant tonight

26:19.640 --> 26:20.790
What are you gong to do?

26:20.810 --> 26:22.860
Do you need any help?

26:22.880 --> 26:24.685
Do you need my men?

26:30.980 --> 26:32.072
Take care!

26:32.920 --> 26:33.906
Thanks!

29:15.480 --> 29:17.092
Chief What's this?

29:17.480 --> 29:18.230
Chief

29:18.250 --> 29:19.226
Inside here

30:27.820 --> 30:29.700
I'm not scared

30:29.720 --> 30:32.847
My boss will post bail for me

30:32.867 --> 30:35.228
If you've the guts
fight with me without a gun

30:35.248 --> 30:37.275
See who is stronger?

30:40.370 --> 30:41.284
5703!

30:42.340 --> 30:43.944
Sir, what's happening?

30:44.204 --> 30:45.106
Nothing!

30:54.680 --> 30:56.200
Sung, what's the charge?

30:56.220 --> 30:58.480
Drug trafficking, attacking the police

30:58.500 --> 31:00.090
How dare you insult Inspector Sung

31:00.110 --> 31:01.843
Take down his statement

31:03.420 --> 31:04.670
Thanks!

31:19.213 --> 31:23.153
How's that? Feeling different!

31:23.742 --> 31:24.905
Can I give you a lift?

31:24.925 --> 31:27.135
No, thanks
We are not going the same way

31:28.261 --> 31:29.600
I admire you

31:29.620 --> 31:32.833
Because of your friends
you kept quiet

31:33.150 --> 31:35.570
That's ridiculous
You were behind bars

31:35.590 --> 31:38.522
The counterfeiting
racket is still strong

31:39.593 --> 31:40.450
Thanks!

31:42.863 --> 31:45.231
I'm not involved anymore

31:50.027 --> 31:51.751
Tell your friends

31:51.929 --> 31:53.886
The case is still open

31:54.140 --> 31:55.692
I won't let him off

31:58.374 --> 31:59.660
A bad guy for a day

31:59.680 --> 32:01.590
Will never be a good guy again

32:04.950 --> 32:05.833
Bye!

32:07.150 --> 32:08.610
I'll never come back again

32:54.579 --> 32:55.560
Stop!

33:25.703 --> 33:27.360
Kit, cool down

33:35.375 --> 33:36.963
Stop fighting

33:46.885 --> 33:48.150
Kit, stop

33:51.444 --> 33:53.647
Don't let me see you again

34:50.920 --> 34:52.083
Manager!

34:57.190 --> 34:58.570
There's no manager here

34:58.590 --> 35:00.871
I'm Kin, are you looking for me?

35:01.930 --> 35:05.510
Uncle Chung, asked me to come see you

35:05.530 --> 35:07.250
When I was doing business in Taiwan...

35:07.270 --> 35:10.557
Doing business?
You were in jail!

35:13.440 --> 35:16.195
Mr. Chung asked me
to give you this letter

35:18.640 --> 35:21.290
Chung, he never does anything good

35:21.310 --> 35:23.780
But we are friends

35:24.250 --> 35:27.322
It's so difficult to get
a job for an ex-con

35:28.266 --> 35:30.606
No one will hire an ex-con

35:34.784 --> 35:36.280
Don't feel depressed

35:36.300 --> 35:40.380
All these guys were prisoner before

35:43.640 --> 35:45.990
Some people like to adopt orphans

35:46.010 --> 35:48.709
I like to take care of ex-cons

35:49.477 --> 35:52.966
Because I was in prison too

35:56.916 --> 36:01.920
Everybody, here's a new man
Take care of him

36:01.940 --> 36:04.170
He is... you are...

36:04.190 --> 36:05.495
Sung Tse Ho

36:05.515 --> 36:06.463
Brother Ho!

36:07.260 --> 36:11.490
Just call me Ho

36:11.900 --> 36:13.777
Social gathering?

36:13.930 --> 36:15.542
Back to work

36:16.400 --> 36:18.544
I'm not paying you for doing nothing

36:19.724 --> 36:20.730
Do you have a driving license?

36:20.750 --> 36:21.340
No

36:21.740 --> 36:24.490
Whether you pass the exam or not...

36:24.510 --> 36:26.525
You can stay

36:26.693 --> 36:27.938
Thanks, Kin

36:27.958 --> 36:32.016
Don't mention it
There's no Boss here

37:43.406 --> 37:45.664
Take it for lunch
Thanks

38:33.927 --> 38:34.870
Mark!

38:45.890 --> 38:49.181
That's not what you told me
in your letter

39:18.580 --> 39:22.273
Even I break my legs

39:23.107 --> 39:25.365
I can't pay you back

39:26.202 --> 39:30.890
It's not your fault

39:37.640 --> 39:39.566
I'm so glad to see you again

39:40.540 --> 39:42.200
Haven't seen you for so long

39:42.440 --> 39:44.718
You're still looking the same

39:47.780 --> 39:51.721
Mark. This isn't our world anymore

39:52.220 --> 39:54.198
Why are you still here?

40:04.260 --> 40:07.976
I've waited for you for 3 years

40:12.610 --> 40:14.032
Let's start all over again

40:33.790 --> 40:38.671
Don't bother me
Pay attention to your brother

40:42.030 --> 40:45.485
He's following Shing everyday
That's very dangerous

40:50.040 --> 40:51.577
You're brothers

40:58.050 --> 41:01.049
Kit, we all know
you are good at your work

41:01.790 --> 41:03.600
I recommended your promotion,

41:03.620 --> 41:05.165
but it's rejected

41:06.330 --> 41:07.136
Why?

41:15.200 --> 41:18.157
This guy, you know him very well

41:21.483 --> 41:23.495
He disappeared 3 years ago

41:23.851 --> 41:26.330
He's back after being released
from prison in Taiwan

41:26.350 --> 41:28.490
and got back with his
old partners again

41:28.510 --> 41:30.289
It's none of my business

41:30.309 --> 41:33.330
We're investigating
underworld contacts in the police

41:33.350 --> 41:37.039
and none of our family members
would be related, in any sense

41:37.885 --> 41:39.198
Understood?

41:43.200 --> 41:45.118
When I carry out my order

41:45.730 --> 41:48.129
I've never thought of my brother

41:49.259 --> 41:50.260
Kit!

41:51.448 --> 41:54.150
You're not in Shing's case anymore

41:54.170 --> 41:56.446
Or you'll spoil the whole matter

42:02.411 --> 42:04.518
Sung, Shing will meet
those Thai tonight...

42:04.538 --> 42:05.750
Nam!

42:14.295 --> 42:17.004
Bottom up

42:17.700 --> 42:18.240
Mark

42:18.260 --> 42:19.450
Tell us about your stories

42:19.470 --> 42:20.280
Let Ho say it

42:20.300 --> 42:20.880
My boss says

42:20.900 --> 42:23.375
$18 million maximum

42:23.640 --> 42:24.420
OK

42:24.440 --> 42:26.370
Boss, Ho is outside

42:29.710 --> 42:31.027
Draught beer, please

42:39.205 --> 42:40.806
This way please

42:47.090 --> 42:47.890
Ho!

42:48.140 --> 42:49.912
How come you didn't
inform us you're back

42:49.932 --> 42:51.492
You shouldn't do that

42:55.730 --> 42:58.690
We were good brothers once
Is that right, Mark?

43:03.940 --> 43:05.620
Ho, if you didn't take care of me

43:05.640 --> 43:07.677
I would never have what I have now

43:08.510 --> 43:09.511
Oh no

43:10.080 --> 43:13.225
You deserve it

43:13.245 --> 43:14.570
I don't have the ability

43:14.590 --> 43:16.449
It's Mark who gave me the chance

43:17.390 --> 43:19.240
Mark, if you need my help in the future

43:19.260 --> 43:20.740
Just say so

43:20.760 --> 43:23.410
Don't bullshit
Let's drink

43:23.430 --> 43:25.829
You take real care of brothers

43:26.630 --> 43:27.219
Cheers!

43:27.350 --> 43:28.120
Cheers!

43:32.500 --> 43:35.340
This is for my leg

43:38.274 --> 43:39.150
Happy

43:48.950 --> 43:51.140
Come to see me when you're free

43:51.160 --> 43:52.470
There's a lot we can talk

43:52.490 --> 43:54.050
I'm not interested

43:54.330 --> 43:55.733
You will be

43:56.700 --> 43:58.182
I have to go

44:06.440 --> 44:07.186
Sung Tse Ho!

44:10.110 --> 44:11.081
Follow me

44:23.538 --> 44:24.240
What are you doing?

44:24.260 --> 44:25.207
Don't move!

44:27.790 --> 44:29.276
What did Shing tell you?

44:30.072 --> 44:30.962
Bullshit!

44:31.560 --> 44:32.932
Don't fool me!

44:33.100 --> 44:35.149
Business or bullshit?

44:35.330 --> 44:36.620
Bullshit, really

44:36.640 --> 44:38.020
Is there something arriving the day after?

44:38.040 --> 44:39.050
Don't know

44:39.070 --> 44:41.290
Where to load and when?

44:41.659 --> 44:42.781
Don't know

44:44.110 --> 44:47.009
How can you be a Big Brother
knowing nothing?

44:48.875 --> 44:49.655
Kit!

44:50.650 --> 44:53.596
Don't call me Kit
call me inspector!

45:02.260 --> 45:08.147
I'm not a Big Brother anymore

45:16.580 --> 45:17.850
Where do you work?

45:18.880 --> 45:20.655
United Taxi Co

45:22.550 --> 45:24.006
Decent business?

45:27.290 --> 45:28.777
Robbing with a taxi?

45:31.496 --> 45:33.010
Where do you live?

45:33.030 --> 45:34.739
United Taxi Co

45:36.731 --> 45:38.674
Someone still accepted you thief

45:40.700 --> 45:43.150
Thief... Doesn't he have a name?

45:43.170 --> 45:44.450
Don't think you are great to have a gun

45:44.470 --> 45:46.653
I'll shoot you down, cripple

45:50.615 --> 45:53.930
Don't point at my head with a gun

45:53.950 --> 45:56.230
If you've got the guts,

45:56.250 --> 45:58.515
then shoot me...

45:59.706 --> 46:00.513
Kit!

46:01.120 --> 46:04.395
Sir, I know I owe you too much

46:04.751 --> 46:06.749
Give me a chance!

46:07.214 --> 46:08.500
Give you a chance?

46:08.660 --> 46:10.871
I beg you to give me one!

46:12.200 --> 46:13.610
Do you know because of you

46:13.630 --> 46:15.685
I lost my chance of promotion

46:16.270 --> 46:18.614
Because you are an
agent of the underworld

46:23.180 --> 46:24.785
Don't leave HK

46:29.520 --> 46:31.491
I'll be back to get you

47:24.100 --> 47:26.790
Come, have a cup of tea

47:26.810 --> 47:28.620
Thanks!

47:28.640 --> 47:30.820
I will deduct it from your salary

47:30.840 --> 47:32.120
You are mean

47:32.140 --> 47:33.390
Otherwise, how can I support my family?

47:33.410 --> 47:34.836
You're right

47:38.350 --> 47:41.070
There's a beautiful girl
staring at you

47:41.090 --> 47:42.509
Your girlfriend?

47:49.810 --> 47:51.138
Please come in!

47:51.425 --> 47:52.383
No!

47:54.435 --> 47:56.105
I want your help

47:58.325 --> 48:00.364
Can you leave HK for a while?

48:02.047 --> 48:04.623
I don't want to see
Kit getting mad

48:04.643 --> 48:08.885
He can't take this pressure
neither can I

48:10.150 --> 48:15.070
So I think it's better for
you to be away for a while

48:15.363 --> 48:16.854
I won't leave!

48:19.038 --> 48:22.801
I want Kit to see that
I'm in my new life

48:23.239 --> 48:24.765
Can you give me a chance

48:24.785 --> 48:26.523
to prove myself?

48:32.581 --> 48:34.750
Don't you see I want to skate

48:34.770 --> 48:38.081
Riding bicycle with him too?

48:38.980 --> 48:41.201
I don't want to lose this brother

48:48.499 --> 48:49.963
Ho!

48:51.772 --> 48:53.715
Don't stay here, go in!

48:54.591 --> 48:57.097
There's no use just staying here

48:57.117 --> 48:59.607
Ho can handle his own matter, go in!

49:02.981 --> 49:04.568
Who are they?

49:04.700 --> 49:05.820
They're not good

49:05.840 --> 49:08.450
Ho, Big Brother wants to see you

49:08.470 --> 49:09.760
I'm busy

49:09.780 --> 49:11.120
Give me some face

49:11.140 --> 49:13.049
Just come with me

49:17.420 --> 49:17.860
Hello!

49:17.880 --> 49:19.976
Ho, Mark is with us

49:19.996 --> 49:21.733
Come over too

49:21.950 --> 49:24.539
No, thanks
I am not interested...

49:24.895 --> 49:26.570
You may not interested in business

49:26.590 --> 49:27.840
How about your brother?

49:27.860 --> 49:29.270
Doesn't it raise your interest?

49:29.290 --> 49:30.535
I'll wait for you!

49:31.500 --> 49:32.423
OK!

49:34.073 --> 49:35.784
Kin, I want to go out for a while

49:37.040 --> 49:39.532
You have to have principle
don't be afraid

49:40.410 --> 49:41.640
Be straight!

49:45.072 --> 49:47.206
Ho, please!

49:50.120 --> 49:54.740
You'll never be cleaned once
you belong to the underworld

50:22.384 --> 50:23.160
Ho!

50:23.344 --> 50:24.028
Ho!

50:25.410 --> 50:27.804
Ho, so glad you're back

50:28.311 --> 50:29.802
How are you, Mr. Yiu?

50:30.220 --> 50:32.540
Fine, thanks

50:32.560 --> 50:34.445
Come, talk to Shing!

50:36.198 --> 50:37.566
Not you?

50:39.152 --> 50:41.102
It's the same as talking to Shing

50:41.122 --> 50:44.830
I'm too old to make decisions

50:45.920 --> 50:47.302
Ho, sit please

50:49.720 --> 50:51.160
We can make big money

50:51.180 --> 50:53.619
I really hope to cooperate with you again

50:54.968 --> 50:55.898
How?

50:56.295 --> 50:57.876
You're still our Big Brother

50:57.896 --> 51:00.021
Mark handles the trafficking of money

51:00.041 --> 51:04.728
I'll take care of the drugs
make money for our company

51:04.748 --> 51:07.772
We need you to contact the old clients

51:09.556 --> 51:11.335
You haven't got to the point yet

51:13.184 --> 51:17.612
With your brother's assistance
That would be perfect!

51:17.632 --> 51:21.546
What else to have your
own man in the police!

51:23.502 --> 51:26.348
Come, I have something to tell you

51:35.718 --> 51:37.620
How about if I don't accept?

51:40.005 --> 51:40.779
Ho

51:40.799 --> 51:43.303
I kept Mark because of you

51:44.548 --> 51:47.444
Your brother is
following everything

51:47.600 --> 51:51.083
If it wasn't you
he's dead already!

51:53.529 --> 51:59.174
Shing, one is my brother
the other is my friend

51:59.194 --> 52:02.361
How would I feel comfortable
if I said yes?

52:03.976 --> 52:05.762
It doesn't matter for you to insult me

52:05.782 --> 52:07.577
But not my friends

52:15.575 --> 52:17.805
If you hurt my brother

52:18.230 --> 52:20.227
You won't live long

52:50.879 --> 52:52.993
We've wanted Mark Lee

52:53.013 --> 52:54.622
for 3 years

52:54.642 --> 52:57.909
But we can't take him back legally

52:57.929 --> 52:59.017
Otherwise,

52:59.037 --> 53:02.090
we can control the syndicate

53:02.110 --> 53:04.234
The ROC Police Dept
wanna give information

53:04.254 --> 53:06.201
to the Interpol to the
Hong Kong Police

53:06.221 --> 53:08.660
The US Police Dept has also taken action

53:08.680 --> 53:09.390
I see!

53:09.410 --> 53:11.730
We've some information recently

53:11.750 --> 53:15.777
in 2 days there'll be counterfeit
shipped to Taiwan

53:15.797 --> 53:18.200
and 500 kg heroin!

53:18.220 --> 53:20.270
Though I can't do
this case myself

53:20.290 --> 53:22.110
I hope to see

53:22.130 --> 53:24.497
Mark and his men being charged

53:31.670 --> 53:34.772
Boss, Ho is too much
Let's kill him

53:35.292 --> 53:37.892
Not necessary

53:48.655 --> 53:50.105
Do as planned

53:59.085 --> 54:00.550
I gave you the money already

54:00.570 --> 54:02.322
Where do we load the thing?

54:02.342 --> 54:04.462
I'll give you the address

54:06.610 --> 54:07.891
Be careful

54:13.516 --> 54:14.555
Get in!

54:19.950 --> 54:21.176
Come back!

54:26.930 --> 54:28.173
Did you have dinner yet?

54:34.143 --> 54:35.388
What are you doing?

55:08.771 --> 55:11.926
Mr. Mok, its Kit, I've got hints

55:11.946 --> 55:14.125
That Thai will deal with Shing tomorrow

55:14.145 --> 55:16.362
Time and location should be...

55:16.382 --> 55:18.474
OK, you hand in the hints tomorrow

55:18.494 --> 55:19.800
and there will be no concern of yours

55:19.820 --> 55:20.566
Why?

55:20.586 --> 55:22.017
You are not involved

55:22.037 --> 55:24.130
I'm afraid that you'll
spoil the whole thing

55:24.150 --> 55:25.602
Give me a chance?

55:25.622 --> 55:28.481
I have told you that
there is no hero in the police

55:28.501 --> 55:30.444
What are you doing now?

55:56.380 --> 55:59.014
Do you know that
today is my birthday?

56:26.062 --> 56:27.506
Can you look at me?

56:27.526 --> 56:28.847
You'd look

56:28.867 --> 56:30.360
a vase

56:30.380 --> 56:33.175
But not me! Today is my birthday!

56:34.708 --> 56:38.279
This is your home
not the police barrack

56:49.160 --> 56:50.200
Jackie

56:56.370 --> 56:57.792
Happy birthday

57:01.358 --> 57:02.753
I didn't forget

57:15.930 --> 57:18.434
Blow out the candles

57:31.640 --> 57:32.490
What wish did you make?

57:32.510 --> 57:34.390
You really want to know?

57:34.410 --> 57:35.660
What is it?

57:35.680 --> 57:37.705
Promise not to lose your temper

57:37.725 --> 57:38.998
Say it

57:41.395 --> 57:44.063
The reunion of the two of you

57:51.730 --> 57:53.240
Don't be angry

57:53.471 --> 57:54.210
Nothing

57:55.570 --> 57:58.572
Don't get angry on my birthday

57:58.592 --> 58:02.690
I don't let you get angry
Otherwise I will get angry

58:02.710 --> 58:03.901
Smile

58:07.310 --> 58:08.744
Let me open it

58:16.052 --> 58:17.379
Anything happens?

58:20.021 --> 58:21.608
I want to speak to Kit

58:26.951 --> 58:28.073
Who is it?

58:28.867 --> 58:30.215
Don't be mad

58:30.235 --> 58:32.602
Keep your promise

58:45.800 --> 58:46.574
Sit

58:46.594 --> 58:47.319
Thanks

58:48.318 --> 58:49.400
Today is your birthday?

58:49.700 --> 58:50.507
Yes

58:50.955 --> 58:52.070
Have a piece of cake

58:52.090 --> 58:53.970
Why do you treat him that nice?

58:53.990 --> 58:56.018
Don't do that

58:58.518 --> 59:01.884
I don't care how you treat me

59:02.330 --> 59:04.680
I'm here to tell you that

59:04.700 --> 59:06.720
Shing tries to tramp you

59:06.740 --> 59:08.407
Be careful

59:08.810 --> 59:10.104
Thank you!

59:10.340 --> 59:12.323
Don't trust those crummy

59:12.761 --> 59:15.490
It's always a trick if you

59:15.510 --> 59:17.569
have clues too easily

59:18.680 --> 59:20.870
Do you think I am as dumb as before?

59:20.890 --> 59:23.400
I only want to help you

59:23.420 --> 59:25.285
Help me or trick me?

59:28.130 --> 59:31.156
Do you know you are my burden

59:32.073 --> 59:34.150
Can you trust me one more time?

59:34.170 --> 59:37.632
Trust you?

59:37.652 --> 59:38.542
Kit!

59:44.122 --> 59:44.847
Jackie!

59:47.450 --> 59:48.331
Ho!

59:49.810 --> 59:53.625
He didn't change a bit on my impression

59:53.645 --> 59:55.402
Don't give up

59:55.422 --> 59:58.515
Don't let the other look down upon you

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.180
Why can't you forgive him?

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.758
Let him start a new life?

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:09.687
He killed dad indirectly!

01:00:10.412 --> 01:00:12.601
Why do you force me to accept him

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:21.199
He can't blame anyone
for choosing the wrong way

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:32.214
I'm the cop, he's the thief

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.750
We're going opposite

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.459
I'm a cop

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.118
What's happening? Kin!

01:01:35.138 --> 01:01:37.601
Your brother is having an operation

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.689
He's now in Princess Margaret Hospital

01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:41.551
Hurry up!

01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:42.228
OK

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.397
What happened to my brother?

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:52.189
He is being tricked by Shing

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.824
He purposely did it

01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:55.699
How is he?

01:01:55.719 --> 01:01:57.171
You can't get in

01:02:38.028 --> 01:02:39.677
I tried to stop him

01:02:39.697 --> 01:02:41.130
But he insisted

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:42.961
I hope you can cooperate with the police

01:02:42.981 --> 01:02:45.097
and let's know your location

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:39.443
It's easy to be a hero. Jump

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.876
It's not the same now
you don't have any choice

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:47.230
Get along with us

01:03:47.613 --> 01:03:49.400
And don't tell the police

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.755
We know each other well

01:04:24.347 --> 01:04:28.920
What's happening?

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.930
You are out of this case

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.800
Stop!

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.580
Fight!

01:05:11.978 --> 01:05:12.760
Stop it!

01:05:13.434 --> 01:05:17.170
Can we make a deal

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:18.889
It's not worthwhile

01:05:18.909 --> 01:05:20.818
breaking rules again

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.687
Stop fighting

01:05:37.228 --> 01:05:38.340
Release him

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.163
Ho!

01:05:42.308 --> 01:05:43.909
You idiot, don't go!

01:05:43.929 --> 01:05:46.730
Stay if you have guts!

01:05:48.752 --> 01:05:50.736
You, son of bitch!

01:05:51.051 --> 01:05:52.515
All bastards!

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:56.964
Kin. That's my fault

01:05:57.265 --> 01:05:59.290
I don't want you to be involved

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:02.670
You've no principle

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:04.947
They fight because they are scared

01:06:04.967 --> 01:06:08.491
If you hit them back then they win

01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:15.630
Why do you want to change?

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:17.008
What for?

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:20.070
Who's he?

01:06:20.203 --> 01:06:21.544
Kin! Ho!

01:06:21.564 --> 01:06:23.031
Come and have a look

01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:24.482
Come over

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:30.450
Mark...

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.383
Emergency box

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.110
Quick!

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.091
Kin, what shall we do?

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.920
You go!

01:07:06.883 --> 01:07:09.250
Police. Stop for searching

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.670
That's too much, officer, I'm injured!

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:17.753
I'll send the quotation to the Station

01:07:17.773 --> 01:07:19.340
Smart ass

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:46.109
I did notice the beauty of HK at night

01:07:48.952 --> 01:07:51.237
But it doesn't last

01:07:51.949 --> 01:07:53.618
It's not worthwhile

01:08:00.566 --> 01:08:01.332
Ho!

01:08:02.276 --> 01:08:03.877
Let's start all over again

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:05.820
After this last time

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.716
then leave HK

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:09.560
Mark!

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.160
We've never been scared before

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.000
Why are we scared of Shing...

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:18.045
Don't push me
I'll never get involved again

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.540
Those are merely memories

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.533
I'm still alive

01:08:29.562 --> 01:08:32.479
Even you do 10 times, 100 times

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.420
Then what?

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.390
Even you kill Shing?

01:08:42.654 --> 01:08:44.522
I lost my brother already

01:08:44.542 --> 01:08:46.786
I don't want to lost you too

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.380
Mark, don't you understand?

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:50.339
I don't want sympathy

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.377
You didn't owe me anything?

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.519
I never force my friends
doing things unwillingly

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:59.625
I've my principle

01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:02.015
I don't want to loose

01:09:02.234 --> 01:09:04.698
for my whole life

01:09:06.069 --> 01:09:08.005
Do you think I like begging?

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.736
I've been waiting 3 years
for this one chance

01:09:13.301 --> 01:09:17.015
The only thing to prove is not my
brilliance but my determination

01:09:17.035 --> 01:09:18.826
to regain the losses

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:31.839
What did you look like?

01:09:33.631 --> 01:09:35.520
We were scolded when we were bad

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:39.139
But when we turn to be good
we are being followed!

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.492
Did you fight for a chance?

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:43.363
You didn't

01:09:44.322 --> 01:09:45.348
No!

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:51.523
Same as you

01:09:55.876 --> 01:09:56.614
Mark!

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.858
What happened to you?

01:10:28.501 --> 01:10:30.239
I just want to take back something

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.530
Stand over that side

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:49.700
Go and take the plate

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.199
You'll be in big trouble

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.614
Think twice before you do it

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:03.084
Stop for a moment

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.180
Run!

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.354
Open the door!

01:11:18.109 --> 01:11:19.299
Thanks. Mr. Chan!

01:11:20.015 --> 01:11:22.200
Go after them

01:13:10.684 --> 01:13:12.257
You idiot!

01:13:12.627 --> 01:13:14.851
I told you that's too much

01:13:14.871 --> 01:13:16.070
Idiot

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:19.296
If Ho hands the plate to the police

01:13:19.316 --> 01:13:22.450
Not only you will die but
even the syndicate will collapse

01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:24.945
That's enough.
Don't call me idiot.

01:13:24.965 --> 01:13:27.380
What did you call me
when I gave you money?

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.080
I regret to have you

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:32.180
I'll kill you if you don't
bring me back the plate

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.520
Kill me then

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.690
I betrayed Ho 3 years ago

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:38.003
Would I be scared of him now?

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.163
You have to pay him back

01:13:43.183 --> 01:13:44.760
We've to share

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.576
the problem together!

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.980
Hello!

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:58.839
Ho, why did you give me such a problem?

01:13:58.859 --> 01:14:01.010
Mr. Yiu. I want to speak to Shing

01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:03.792
Shing? Wait a minute

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:08.757
Ask him to give us back the plate

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:12.790
Ho, don't fool me

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:14.917
We can compromise

01:14:14.937 --> 01:14:16.090
10pm tonight.

01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:19.228
Go to Temple with US$ 2 million
for the exchange of the plate

01:14:19.248 --> 01:14:21.985
and have a boat ready for me at The Bay

01:14:22.005 --> 01:14:23.030
That's simple?

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.277
I want cash

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:26.170
You! Yourself!

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:27.567
I will be there

01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:37.754
What did Ho say?

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.477
What did he say?

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:43.650
What?

01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:47.603
- He said he wants to have dinner with you.
- OK, I'll wait for him.

01:14:51.658 --> 01:14:52.180
Sir!

01:14:53.068 --> 01:14:53.670
Sir!

01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:55.873
Come in!

01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:57.998
Mr. Mok, I've information

01:14:58.018 --> 01:15:00.092
Ho, Mark and Shing had a quarrel

01:15:00.112 --> 01:15:03.630
Then Ho and Mark blackmailed Shing
and they're having a deal tonight

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.750
Did you know the time and place?

01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:07.851
Later

01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:11.367
Hello. I'm...

01:15:13.428 --> 01:15:14.249
Thanks!

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.362
2 minutes ago

01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:19.808
Shing debited US$2 million from the bank

01:15:19.828 --> 01:15:22.230
Everyone gets ready
for order

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:23.317
Yes, Sir!

01:15:23.821 --> 01:15:25.641
Mr. Mok. Let me in

01:15:26.297 --> 01:15:28.811
You should be in the hospital.
What are you doing here?

01:15:30.645 --> 01:15:33.293
I'm fine

01:15:33.313 --> 01:15:35.776
You've a paid leave for a few days

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:39.386
See, I can lift the chair easily

01:15:39.406 --> 01:15:41.322
You're not included

01:15:41.999 --> 01:15:44.448
My brother is the thief.
Not me!

01:15:45.538 --> 01:15:47.885
Why do you
give me pressure?

01:15:47.905 --> 01:15:49.627
If you still remember the rules
you shouldn't get involved

01:15:49.647 --> 01:15:51.490
I've been following Shing.
Since my bad died three years ago.

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:54.083
But you and Ho are brothers!
I know this case most thoroughly.

01:15:54.103 --> 01:15:57.537
Don't oppress me.
I want to lock him up myself.

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.650
I'll lock him up

01:16:03.562 --> 01:16:05.491
I will!

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:11.724
Kit. Be practical

01:17:03.436 --> 01:17:04.550
Jackie

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.684
I'm leaving HK tonight

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.339
You are giving up?

01:17:16.516 --> 01:17:20.435
Can you give this packet
to Kit tonight before 9?

01:17:20.778 --> 01:17:23.158
It's very important to him

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.792
Will you come back?

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.040
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.441
He asked me to give this packet to you

01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:55.713
Kit. The plate I gave you

01:17:55.733 --> 01:17:58.450
is the proof to charge Shing

01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:01.280
We're having a dealing tonight at The Bay

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.120
You can put me in prison if you like to

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.004
I decided not to stay in HK

01:18:08.132 --> 01:18:10.411
What are you doing?

01:18:10.431 --> 01:18:11.574
I have to grab him

01:18:11.594 --> 01:18:13.467
No. You can't

01:18:13.487 --> 01:18:15.310
No. Go away!

01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:21.420
Kit...

01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:34.318
Where's Ho? They are late

01:18:38.998 --> 01:18:40.708
Do you know what to say?

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.518
Do you believe in god?

01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:13.406
I'm the god

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.379
God is a human

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:21.948
Anyone will be god
if he can control his life

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:27.156
But sometimes you couldn't

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.409
You'll either gain or loose

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:43.466
Hold it!

01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:47.435
Money?

01:19:50.405 --> 01:19:51.418
Plate?

01:19:52.047 --> 01:19:53.579
Hand it to the police

01:20:00.016 --> 01:20:00.950
Don't!

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.659
There's a bomb"

01:20:03.851 --> 01:20:05.452
I'm not a dummy.

01:20:10.499 --> 01:20:11.785
You scared?

01:20:12.798 --> 01:20:15.343
How can we go on with the game
if you are scared?

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:50.600
Shit!

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.808
After Ho arrived
he had a quarrel with Master

01:20:56.828 --> 01:21:00.379
He asked for US$ 2 million.
He'll be at sea tonight.

01:21:00.399 --> 01:21:03.510
Then I heard a shot.
That's him.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.440
Are you sure?

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.476
Yes!

01:21:06.496 --> 01:21:07.770
Do you want to be the witness?

01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:09.120
Yes!

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.018
I know you'll do that already

01:21:48.038 --> 01:21:49.310
You'll lose

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:50.228
Get out!

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.860
Get out...

01:21:55.274 --> 01:21:57.545
If you're better, release him!

01:21:59.651 --> 01:22:02.300
Come over

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:03.961
Go!

01:22:24.403 --> 01:22:25.648
Ho, on board

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.455
You go first

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.813
You said we'll go together

01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:35.228
I've something to do

01:22:39.126 --> 01:22:40.918
I'll meet you

01:22:43.706 --> 01:22:45.895
Mark. Go!

01:22:51.464 --> 01:22:53.202
I'll wait for you

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.070
Go!

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.702
Release him

01:24:00.722 --> 01:24:02.750
Otherwise, I'll kill your brother

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:04.074
Don't do it

01:24:06.494 --> 01:24:07.835
One for each

01:24:15.549 --> 01:24:16.343
Go!

01:24:19.216 --> 01:24:19.941
Go!

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.665
I won't let you off

01:24:41.646 --> 01:24:42.768
I know!

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:57.380
Kit!

01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:07.535
Come over

01:28:53.376 --> 01:28:54.608
You

01:28:56.947 --> 01:28:59.711
Look at your brother

01:29:02.207 --> 01:29:03.521
Look!

01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:09.690
No matter what he had done

01:29:09.710 --> 01:29:11.303
He paid you back now

01:29:16.787 --> 01:29:18.839
He has the guts to change

01:29:19.017 --> 01:29:20.885
What can't you forgive him?

01:29:20.905 --> 01:29:21.822
Why?

01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:29.423
For a brother...

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:17.316
Shing!

01:30:17.453 --> 01:30:19.232
Shing!

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.414
You can't get over, Miss

01:30:52.454 --> 01:30:53.699
Shing!

01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:02.648
Ho, you're being surrounded

01:31:02.668 --> 01:31:04.537
In 3 minutes

01:31:04.557 --> 01:31:06.650
Come out unarmed

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:21.374
No more bullets

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.920
I'm going to surrender

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:26.490
I'll be alright

01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:27.804
You'll not

01:31:29.421 --> 01:31:32.642
I've money, 3 days later

01:31:32.662 --> 01:31:34.208
I'll be released

01:31:34.523 --> 01:31:37.574
I've money, can change black to white

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.974
I learned it from you

01:31:41.261 --> 01:31:43.047
But your brother,

01:31:43.067 --> 01:31:45.840
because of you
he's from white to black

01:31:46.073 --> 01:31:47.537
You tramp him

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.050
Kit. You didn't do it wrong

01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:04.035
We are on different routes

01:33:05.066 --> 01:33:07.447
Yours are right

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:17.614
I was wrong before

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.673
I want to be back on the right one now

01:33:23.305 --> 01:33:29.932
