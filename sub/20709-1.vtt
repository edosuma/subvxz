01:01.720 --> 01:04.200
<i>This is a true story</i>

01:04.319 --> 01:08.848
<i>of my sister Daisy
and my cousin Gracie and me</i>

01:08.960 --> 01:10.928
<i>when we were little.</i>

01:13.280 --> 01:16.284
<i>Our people, the Jigalong mob,</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:19.131
<i>We were desert people then,
walking all over our land.</i>

01:21.840 --> 01:23.569
<i>My mum told me</i>

01:23.680 --> 01:27.810
<i>about how the white people
came to our country.</i>

01:27.920 --> 01:31.845
<i>They made a storehouse
here at Jigalong.</i>

01:31.960 --> 01:36.761
<i>Brought clothes and other
things: flour, tobacco, tea.</i>

01:37.920 --> 01:40.605
<i>Gave them to us on ration day.</i>

01:42.160 --> 01:45.801
<i>We came there,
made a camp nearby.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:50.048
<i>They were building
a long fence.</i>

02:12.040 --> 02:14.964
<i>My dad was a white man
working on that fence.</i>

02:18.000 --> 02:20.571
<i>The white people
called me a half-caste.</i>

02:48.480 --> 02:53.480
See that bird?
That's the Spirit Bird.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.644
He will always look after you.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.411
Hey, granddaughter,
watch where you run.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.524
You kids will
destroy the tracks.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.803
He's here somewhere.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.924
Keep looking.
Maybe over there.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.205
Here they are. Look.

03:49.640 --> 03:54.043
He's going this way.
See the tracks?

03:54.640 --> 03:56.608
Here, here. In the tree.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.803
Watch out for his claws.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.691
Good hunters in this family.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.486
You're growing up fast, Molly.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.966
That's them.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.522
Molly's the big one. The
little one's her sister Daisy.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.120
The middle one's their cousin,
Gracie.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.443
- What about the fathers?
- Moved on.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.287
- I catch 'em goanna.
- Molly got goanna!

04:46.400 --> 04:48.164
Bring it here.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.568
Fat one!

05:03.160 --> 05:06.767
Molly, hide those kids.
Police looking for half-castes.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.686
Next batch.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.043
There's two applications
for section 63 exemptions.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.764
The police reports are there.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.370
William Harris is applying for

05:53.480 --> 05:56.245
permission to marry -
she's half-caste also.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.442
And Mary Wilson
is applying for permission

05:58.560 --> 06:00.608
to visit her child
at Moore River.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.168
She's quite agitated.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.328
Oh, and Gladys Phillips
has written

06:09.440 --> 06:11.568
for permission to buy
some new shoes.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.489
She had a new pair a year ago.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.485
This report
from Constable Riggs

06:16.600 --> 06:18.489
about the three little
half-caste girls

06:18.600 --> 06:21.888
at the Jigalong Fence Depot-
Molly, Gracie and Daisy.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.809
The youngest is of
particular concern.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.730
She's promised to a full-blood.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.683
I'm authorising their removal.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.088
They're to be taken to Moore
River as soon as possible.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.606
Oh, and Miss Thomas -
if you could check

06:36.720 --> 06:38.802
that the rate for
police transportation

06:38.920 --> 06:41.924
is still, I believe,
eight pence per mile.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.883
- Yes, Mr Neville.
- Thank you.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.371
That country over there,
that's woman country.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.927
You can't go there.
You get big trouble.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.128
Yeah, I know.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.363
- Where your country?
- My country?

07:29.480 --> 07:32.245
Down south. Long way from here.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.924
Our dad works there
on the rabbit fence.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.049
Yeah?

07:43.160 --> 07:45.766
How far does rabbit fence go to?

07:47.920 --> 07:49.888
The rabbit-proof fence?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.806
It goes all the way to the sea
down that way.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.241
Right to the top of Australia.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.328
Longest fence in the world.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.327
And all the way to the sea
down that way.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.806
1,500 miles long.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.048
Keeps the rabbits
on that side of the fence,

08:09.160 --> 08:11.891
keeps the farmland
on this side of the fence.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.130
That Molly's getting to be
a big girl.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.449
Mr Neville's been writing to
me about those girls, you know?

08:25.560 --> 08:28.689
Tell that Mr Devil
Molly not going.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.962
She get married.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.004
You tell that Mr Devil,
he want half-caste kid,

08:34.120 --> 08:36.087
he make his own.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.128
Frankie.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.207
Come on, it's your turn.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.288
Come and get your rations.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.931
Hurry up.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.805
Run!

09:07.920 --> 09:10.161
Gracie, come here!

09:35.720 --> 09:37.290
I've come for the girls.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.402
Can't have 'em
in a black fellas' camp.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.763
- My kids! Mine!
- It's the law, Maude.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.723
- You've got no say in it.
- No! Mine!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.525
Mr Neville's orders.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.367
Move one inch
and I'll lock your mother up!

09:53.800 --> 09:55.962
He's their legal guardian.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.644
Get away from us! No!

10:02.080 --> 10:03.684
Gracie!

10:03.800 --> 10:06.644
Give me back my kids!

10:06.760 --> 10:08.649
You sit up and you stay!

10:08.760 --> 10:11.411
- I got the papers, Maude.!
- Don't take them!

10:11.520 --> 10:13.966
You got no say in it!

10:14.080 --> 10:16.048
Come along.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.203
Just get in the back!

10:28.480 --> 10:30.847
The three of youse, don't move.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.731
There's nothing you can do here,
old girl.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.764
- Nothing you can do.
- Leave them!

10:59.520 --> 11:01.124
Leave them!

11:28.520 --> 11:30.966
Every Aborigine
born in this state

11:31.080 --> 11:34.084
comes under my control.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.727
Notice, if you will,
the half-caste child -

11:37.840 --> 11:40.286
and there are ever-increasing
numbers of them.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.051
Now, what is
to happen to them?

11:43.160 --> 11:48.087
Are we to allow the creation
of an unwanted third race?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.851
Should the coloureds be
encouraged to go back to black

11:50.960 --> 11:53.566
or should they be advanced
to white status

11:53.680 --> 11:57.207
and be absorbed
in the white population?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.687
Now, time and again
I'm asked by some white man,

11:59.800 --> 12:01.529
"If I marry
this coloured person,

12:01.640 --> 12:03.404
will our children be black?

12:03.520 --> 12:06.171
As Chief Protector of Aborigines
it is my responsibility

12:06.280 --> 12:08.965
to accept or reject
those marriages.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.331
Here... is the answer.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.727
Three generations.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.410
Half-blood grandmother,

12:21.520 --> 12:25.002
quadroon daughter,
octoroon grandson.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.364
As you can see, in the third
generation, or third cross,

12:29.480 --> 12:32.006
no trace of native origin
is apparent.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.727
The continuing infiltration
of white blood

12:35.840 --> 12:39.686
finally stamps out
the black colour.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.486
The Aboriginal
has simply been...

12:43.600 --> 12:45.648
bred out.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.728
Now...

12:47.840 --> 12:49.808
we come to...

12:52.560 --> 12:55.484
the Moore River
Native Settlement.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.841
Most of you are familiar with
our work here,

12:57.960 --> 13:00.167
the training of servants
and farm labourers.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.489
I would like to thank you
for your continuing support.

13:03.600 --> 13:07.047
Hundreds of half-caste children
have been gathered up

13:07.160 --> 13:09.162
and brought here
to be given the benefit

13:09.280 --> 13:11.681
of everything our culture
has to offer.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.970
For if we are to fit and train
such children for the future

13:18.080 --> 13:20.686
they cannot be left
as they are,

13:20.800 --> 13:25.203
and, in spite of himself,
the native must be helped.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.802
Hello there.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.609
A ghost!

15:06.560 --> 15:08.005
You poor dears.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.851
It's such a long way.
You must be exhausted.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.203
Come along. I'll take you
straight to the dormitory.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.880
Quickly. It's all right.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.166
Come on. Down you hop.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.008
Come along.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.322
Follow me. Come along.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.283
Follow me, please.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.408
That's the way.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.608
Come along.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.722
There's some beds there.
The bucket's in the corner.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.808
Hurry up.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.122
Back to sleep,
the rest of you. No talking.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.809
Get up!
All of youse! Make your beds.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.208
Hurry up.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.210
Karen, Cheryl,
stop running around.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.128
Get them blankets tidy.

17:04.119 --> 17:07.521
What's your name?
Where you from?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.960
You'll get used to it.

17:14.079 --> 17:17.448
Tracker girl, get that bucket.
Take it out now!

17:17.560 --> 17:21.166
What are you standing
there dreaming about? Hurry up!

17:24.839 --> 17:26.808
Move!

17:29.640 --> 17:32.166
Get out to breakfast now.
Come on.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.248
Get going, all of you.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.367
Come on. You coming?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.083
Thank you, children.
Ready for our prayers.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.125
Bow your heads. Eyes closed.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.882
Thank you for
the food we eat.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.765
Thank you for
the world so sweet.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.281
Thank you for
the birds that sing.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.165
Thank you, God,
for everything.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.848
There will be no talking.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.329
We'll have no wangka here.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.363
You talk English!

18:42.480 --> 18:43.845
Now, eat!

18:45.520 --> 18:48.763
Eat, or I'll hold your nose
and force it down you!

18:49.680 --> 18:51.603
Here.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.326
Keep still.
We've got to scrub you.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.968
Let me see.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.123
Doesn't that feel better?

19:01.240 --> 19:03.811
- Yes, Miss Jessop.
- Yes, Miss Jessop.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.526
- Thank you, Miss Jessop.
- Thank you, Miss Jessop.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.608
That feels much better.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.409
Here.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.409
Take it.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.488
Put these on.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.408
Come on. Get dressed.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.246
New clothes.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.967
This is your new home.
We don't use that jabba here.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.048
You speak English.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.961
♪ Way down upon the Swanee River

Singing Mr Debil's
favourite song.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.087

20:27.400 --> 20:30.802
The following children will
come forward. Tommy Grant.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.007
This way, Tommy.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.441
Come on. Stand up straight.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.528
Whoa. Whoa, boy.

20:46.160 --> 20:50.404
- What they doing now?
- Checking for the fair ones.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.841
- Why?
- To take them to Sister Kate's.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.760
They're more clever than us.
They can go to proper school.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.882
Thank you. No.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.848
Good boy.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.648
That you.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.203
- Molly Craig!
- Go on, get up.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.848
Hurry up. They'll whip you.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.724
Molly. Come on, dear.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.410
Get up. Quick.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.285
- Come on, young lady.
- They'll put you in the boob.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.966
- Just Molly, please.
- Where you going? Come back.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.923
- Sit down.
- Hurry up.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.848
Come along.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.848
It's all right.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.088
That's the way.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.964
Don't be afraid.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.731
Come along.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.684
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- See?

22:02.560 --> 22:04.528
Bit further.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.291
That's it.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.880
It's Molly, isn't it?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.241
I know it all feels
very strange,

22:13.360 --> 22:17.570
but after a few days
you'll feel quite at home.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.810
We're here to help and encourage
you in this new world.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.890
Duty, service, responsibility -

22:26.200 --> 22:28.168
those are our watchwords.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.607
- Molly, keep still.
- It's all right.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.965
No.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.727
Sweep it over here.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.881
To the door.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.606
Come on, this way.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.688
Push it towards me.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.409
Hey, tracker girl.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.842
Your dad's bringing
Olive back. He catched her.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.168
Thank you, Moodoo.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.884
There now, young lady.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.447
Did you really think
you'd get away with it?

23:50.560 --> 23:53.166
Now, stop that crying.
See what Miss Doyle has here?

23:53.280 --> 23:56.921
Olive, look at me.
You see this here? The scissors?

23:58.640 --> 24:00.563
Did she run away home?

24:00.680 --> 24:02.808
She ran away
to see her boyfriend.

24:02.920 --> 24:06.527
You should have thought
about this beforehand. Come on.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.723
We'll see if those boys
find you so attractive now.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.408
In you go.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.288
Broke out through here.
Usual story.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.448
Off to see her boyfriend.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.771
- The tracker brought her back.
- Yes, Moodoo.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.646
Mr Neal tells me that
your probation period is up

24:40.760 --> 24:44.162
and that you wish to return to
the Kimberleys. Is that right?

24:47.720 --> 24:50.371
Of course your daughter is here,
isn't she?

24:54.840 --> 24:56.842
There would be
no question of her going.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.282
She would have to stay here
and continue her training.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.250
I think for the time being it
would be best for all concerned

25:05.360 --> 25:08.125
if you were to remain here,
Moodoo.

25:08.240 --> 25:12.370
I'd be prepared to consider your
case in a year or so, but...

25:12.480 --> 25:14.050
until then...

25:22.880 --> 25:25.929
Those babies.
Where are their mothers?

25:26.040 --> 25:28.168
They got no mothers.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.127
Nobody here got any mothers.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.083
I got mother.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.484
Come on, they're lining up.
Let's go.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.488
Bad place.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.891
Make me sick.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.968
These people...

27:23.800 --> 27:24.961
Sick.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.728
Make me sick.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.688
Come on, make your beds.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.882
Nice and tidy.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.004
If you've already done it,
get to the church now.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.929
Hurry up.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.407
Stop dawdling.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.841
Molly, take the bucket out,

28:10.960 --> 28:13.247
then the three of you
go to the church.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.848
Come on, you kids,
get up there! You're late.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.928
Hurry up.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.811
Come on.
Get your things. We're going.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.606
- Where are we going?
- Home. To mother.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.806
How we gonna get there?

28:49.920 --> 28:51.445
Walk.

28:53.160 --> 28:56.721
We're not going. Are we, Daisy?
We like it here.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.127
That tracker, he's going to
put us in that boob.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.208
He's not going to
put us in the boob.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.881
We just keep walking.
The rain will cover our tracks.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.570
We've got to go now.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.648
Come on. Quick.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.368
Come on.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.684
Come on, Gracie. Now.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.043
- Too far, Molly.
- Hurry up!

29:35.000 --> 29:37.924
♪ He made their tiny wings

29:39.480 --> 29:42.802
♪ All things
bright and beautiful

29:42.920 --> 29:46.481
♪ All creatures great and small

30:19.960 --> 30:21.928
Come on. Let's go!

30:48.480 --> 30:50.801
- Irene Clark.
- Here.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.922
- Ellie Moodoo.
- Here.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.327
Molly Craig.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.408
Molly Craig.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.088
Molly Craig.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.810
Gracie Fields.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.048
Daisy Kadibil.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.251
Nina, have you seen
the new girls?

31:22.360 --> 31:24.727
Haven't seen them all day, miss.

31:42.160 --> 31:45.562
Mister! Mr Neville said you'd
better come real quick.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.929
That's two days ago, Mr Neal.

33:33.040 --> 33:36.362
Yes, I understand, but I require
to be kept fully informed.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.048
Thank you. Goodbye.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.526
Those three girls.
They've run off.

33:45.640 --> 33:48.450
- Oh, dear.
- I blame the older one.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.487
I wondered when I saw her.

33:52.600 --> 33:56.286
Too much of their mind...
unfathomable.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.808
The tracker's onto it. It must
be kept out of the papers.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.650
- No rain. Tracker'll get us.
- Tracker's not gonna get us!

34:06.760 --> 34:08.284
Come on.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.126
We've got to keep going.
Come on, Gracie.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.128
Daisy, give me your bag.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.924
Give us your bag, quick.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.603
Give us it!

34:56.000 --> 34:59.368
Hurry up. In the water!
We need to go fast.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.561
I see...

37:13.360 --> 37:15.761
I see... the kangaroo. Red rock.

37:15.880 --> 37:17.644
No.

37:17.760 --> 37:21.003
I don't see nothing.
There's no food here.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.566
- I see...
- You don't know this place.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.728
How we gonna eat?

37:31.160 --> 37:33.128
Run!

37:33.240 --> 37:35.208
Quick, hide. Come on.

37:45.320 --> 37:48.722
Ask them, Molly. Ask them if
they have something to eat.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.008
You're from that
Moore River place, eh?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.770
We’re going home.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.564
Where your country?

38:22.880 --> 38:24.689
- Jigalong.
- Jigalong?

38:24.800 --> 38:26.768
Proper long way.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.448
You know what you're doing?

38:41.120 --> 38:43.088
That tracker from Moore River.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.248
Him really good.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.125
I heard he get them runaways
all the time.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.481
Gotta be good to beat him.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.524
Take you back to that place.
Here.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.528
You watch out for him, eh?

39:07.920 --> 39:09.888
You think you're so smart...

39:12.440 --> 39:14.408
Where are we?

39:15.760 --> 39:17.728
We're lost.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.167
Jigalong that way. North.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.130
Tracker followed them to...
this riverbank,

39:32.240 --> 39:34.288
but lost their tracks
about a week ago.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.482
There's been
no sign of them since.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.568
Three little half-castes.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.569
We're talking quite a few
man-hours.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.966
Who's going to pay?

39:42.080 --> 39:43.889
There's very little
in my budget.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.970
If your men can combine this
with their regular duties...

39:47.080 --> 39:49.082
We'll be able to handle
the notifications.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.090
- Post police stations, farms.
- We'll provide a description.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.771
But if my men have to make trips
outside of their duties

39:54.880 --> 39:56.928
it'll be an impost
on your department.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.011
If they are out on other jobs
there would be no extra expense.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.804
I can see that.

40:02.920 --> 40:06.447
And it is the job of every one
of your men as local Protectors.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.847
My men will do their jobs,
Mr Neville.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.040
- Now, a week ago, you said.
- Yes.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.168
Hey, Maude. The girls have gone.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.650
What'd you say?

40:29.760 --> 40:33.162
They've run away from
Moore River. They're gone.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.089
Everybody's looking for 'em.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.209
And what do you think
you might be up to?

41:17.320 --> 41:19.084
Thieving my eggs, eh?

41:19.200 --> 41:21.885
You come out here
where I can see you. Come on.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.927
Stand up. Out you come.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.927
And get rid of that bread.
It's filthy.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.609
You want something to eat,
you ask for it.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.804
Come on.
I'm not going to bite you.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.368
You're on your own?

41:59.880 --> 42:01.848
Got anyone with you?

42:22.640 --> 42:24.768
Where you girls
planning on going?

42:28.560 --> 42:30.528
Cat got your tongue, eh?

42:42.400 --> 42:44.368
Now get. Go on.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.446
And watch out for those boys
further along.

42:53.560 --> 42:56.291
They go out hunting rabbits
along the fence.

43:02.280 --> 43:06.046
- That rabbit-proof fence?
- Yes, the rabbit-proof fence.

43:06.160 --> 43:09.209
- Where that rabbit fence?
- East.

43:40.520 --> 43:42.648
Which way now?

43:42.760 --> 43:44.603
That way. That fence.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.768
Find that rabbit fence,
we go home.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.848
Then we see our mum.

44:06.200 --> 44:11.445
"The Chief Protector of
Aborigines, Mr AO Neville...

44:11.560 --> 44:13.642
The devil!

44:13.760 --> 44:16.969
...Is concerned about
three native girls,

44:17.080 --> 44:22.007
ranging from eight to fourteen
years of age, who a month ago

44:22.120 --> 44:24.566
ran away from the Moore River
Native Settlement."

44:26.680 --> 44:31.607
"He would be grateful
if any person who saw them

44:31.720 --> 44:34.087
would notify him...

44:34.200 --> 44:35.964
promptly.

44:36.080 --> 44:40.449
"'We have been searching high
and low for the children

44:40.560 --> 44:43.530
for a month past,'
added Mr Neville,

44:43.640 --> 44:45.449
Devil!

44:45.560 --> 44:48.245
'And all the trace we found
of them was a dead rabbit."'

45:20.080 --> 45:22.128
It's the fence! Down there!

46:06.800 --> 46:09.690
The latest sighting, which is
four days old, puts them...

46:09.800 --> 46:12.485
- The man from the newspaper.
- I have nothing more to say.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.568
May I have a look?

46:15.880 --> 46:18.645
Now, Albany, yes?

46:18.760 --> 46:21.604
Gilwarra. Yalgoo...

46:27.520 --> 46:29.409
Dalwallinu...

46:29.520 --> 46:31.568
Gilwarra, Yalgoo.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.002
Dalwallinu, Gilwarra, Yalgoo.

46:41.480 --> 46:43.209
They're on the fence.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.041
They're following
the rabbit-proof fence.

46:47.160 --> 46:48.525
Right!

46:50.120 --> 46:52.168
Just because a people
use Neolithic tools

46:52.280 --> 46:55.090
does not mean they have
Neolithic minds.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.282
This makes our task
very much easier. Look.

46:57.400 --> 47:00.244
There's a branch off here
to the west, north of Yalgoo.

47:00.360 --> 47:05.287
You put your man out here on the
fence north of this junction.

47:05.400 --> 47:08.051
He can start to come down it
to meet them,

47:08.160 --> 47:11.881
while our Moodoo comes up
from the south behind them.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.685
You can't miss them.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.683
Where Daisy?

47:53.800 --> 47:55.768
Wait here.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.570
My legs, Molly.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.648
They hurt. I can't walk.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.362
I'm carrying you only once,
all right?

48:18.480 --> 48:20.050
Come on.

48:20.160 --> 48:22.128
Come on...

48:36.280 --> 48:38.760
Don't think I'm carrying you
all the way.

48:42.640 --> 48:44.608
Camp, Molly!

48:56.600 --> 48:58.250
Company-

49:00.640 --> 49:02.608
Where you girls headed?

49:06.880 --> 49:09.247
Down to Mullewa?

49:09.360 --> 49:11.328
You got family there?

49:13.840 --> 49:16.810
- Where Mullewa?
- Mullewa?

49:17.960 --> 49:20.440
West.

49:20.560 --> 49:23.040
The way you're headed,
along the number two fence.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.970
They got two rabbit-proof fence?

49:26.080 --> 49:28.367
My oath. They got three of 'em.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.564
We're on the wrong fence.

49:34.440 --> 49:36.169
Where that north fence?

49:36.280 --> 49:40.365
North fence? Back that way -
where you come from.

49:41.360 --> 49:43.010
You can cut across.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.691
I'll show you.
Number one rabbit fence.

49:47.080 --> 49:48.889
Here's the number two fence.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.809
Now you're here.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.082
But you wanna be here.

49:53.200 --> 49:55.726
Now, if you cut across here...

49:57.440 --> 50:00.523
you save yourself
a hundred mile or so.

50:00.640 --> 50:02.608
It's not hard.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.968
I'm going back.

50:23.080 --> 50:25.048
I don't have the petrol.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.448
Over here.

51:00.680 --> 51:02.250
And we're hungry.

51:18.280 --> 51:20.328
Youse that lot from Moore River?

51:23.080 --> 51:24.844
What, you girls
walk all that way?

51:27.080 --> 51:28.605
800 miles?

51:30.280 --> 51:32.089
I was there.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.362
Too scared to run away, but...

51:34.480 --> 51:39.008
Everyone was always caught,
stuck in that boob.

51:39.120 --> 51:41.851
Youse got the furtherest.
Where you heading?

51:42.920 --> 51:45.241
- Home.
- Mavis!

51:47.640 --> 51:50.564
Stay here.
I'll come back and get you.

51:50.680 --> 51:53.923
You can sleep with me tonight.
I'll get you some food.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.087
Just getting the washing,
Mrs Evans!

52:35.600 --> 52:37.489
What's that?

52:37.600 --> 52:38.965
Someone coming.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.847
Quick, in the bed.
Under the blankets.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.722
What are you
playing at, Mavis?

53:31.960 --> 53:33.610
Go away.

53:33.720 --> 53:36.371
Come on, quick.
Get up. Come on.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.168
Don't go, Molly.

53:47.160 --> 53:49.128
Please don't go.

53:51.960 --> 53:53.928
He come back if you go.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.530
Don't go.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.244
He won't say anything.

54:05.480 --> 54:07.448
Please.

54:37.400 --> 54:39.289
Hello, Evans.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.970
Hello.

54:41.080 --> 54:43.321
Quick, wake up!
Wake up! Got to go.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.248
Let's have a look.

54:51.120 --> 54:53.600
Run that way
and just keep going.

55:14.480 --> 55:18.246
They were running out over
there. About an hour or so ago.

55:41.760 --> 55:44.525
We'll pick up the tracks
in the morning.

55:44.640 --> 55:47.007
I'll make a cup of tea.

55:56.920 --> 55:59.491
That's the tracker.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.168
Yeah, that's him.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.528
Hop on.

58:40.920 --> 58:42.604
I do not expect you
to understand

58:42.720 --> 58:44.609
what I am trying to do
for these people,

58:44.720 --> 58:47.087
but I will not have my plans
put into jeopardy.

58:47.200 --> 58:51.046
The problem of half-castes
is not simply going to go away.

58:51.160 --> 58:54.323
If not dealt with now, it will
fester for years to come.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.442
These children are that problem.

58:56.560 --> 58:58.881
Please explain
exactly what happened.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.162
I don't know how they did it,
but we lost them.

59:01.280 --> 59:03.931
I had Larsen out there,
Moodoo was with him -

59:04.040 --> 59:05.690
and we lost them.

59:05.800 --> 59:07.882
- They're making fools of us.
- They are indeed.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.162
The cost is more than to
just our pride.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.931
This department's reputation
is beginning to suffer.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.122
I assure you,
my men have better things to do

59:15.240 --> 59:18.687
than chase your charges
all around the country.

59:18.800 --> 59:22.009
Now... they're coming into
very rough terrain.

59:23.440 --> 59:26.728
Once they're much past
Meekatharra

59:26.840 --> 59:28.569
I can't risk any of my men.

59:28.680 --> 59:32.651
We must find them before they
get into real desert country.

59:32.760 --> 59:34.683
So, this is what
we’re going to do.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.371
You get your man up there.
Moodoo can join him.

59:37.480 --> 59:39.642
Well up the fence,
around here.

59:39.760 --> 59:42.411
Far enough up so we know
we cannot possibly miss them.

59:43.640 --> 59:45.324
And I want them to stay there.

59:45.440 --> 59:47.488
They can set up camp and wait.

59:47.600 --> 59:49.728
Costly.

59:49.840 --> 59:52.366
We'll just have to bear it.

59:52.480 --> 59:54.448
Their lives may be at stake.

59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.441
I understand the mother of one
of the girls has gone to Wiluna.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.803
They're headed into that
country. I want the word spread.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.809
Let's see what that does.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.688
You wouldn't get me out there.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.848
She's pretty clever, that girl.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.808
She wants to go home.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.048
Good thing you kids ran into me.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.249
Lot of people worried for you.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.727
Police up and down the country
looking for youse.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.808
It's in all the papers.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.328
Which one of you is Gracie?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.290
You Gracie?

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.004
I hear your mummy in Wiluna.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.600
You can catch a train there
from Meeka.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.924
Come on. Let's go.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.366
- Wiluna. She at Wiluna?
- Yes.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.850
Come on, Gracie.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.282
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.522
Maybe she's there, Molly.
Maybe he telling the truth.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.328
Molly.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.805
Let's go to Meeka.
Catch a train to Wiluna.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.809
They see us, they'll catch us.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.410
We can't stop now.
Got to keep going.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.568
We're nearly there.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.331
But Molly... mummy there.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.041
She at Wiluna. I want mummy.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.046
Come on.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.128
Come on, Daisy.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.008
Come on, Daisy.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.648
You have to carry me, Molly.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.168
Hop on.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.448
She's not coming.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.285
Don't look back. She'll come.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.485
Higher.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.847
You got 'em?

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.046
Three.
One for you, one for me...

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.128
And one for both of us.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.601
Come on, Dais.
We’re going to wait for Gracie.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.888
Go!

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.646
I've got her.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.728
I want to get the train
to mummy!

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.921
Can you see him?

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.008
Oi! Trevor!

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.446
Thanks, Jackie. You'll get
your reward back at the station.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.647
Taking you back
where you belong.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.209
She gone, Molly.
She not coming back.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.248
Needle in a haystack.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.890
That's it.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.651
Pack your stuff!
We're getting out of here.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.888
They're only paying us
for three weeks.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.769
To Constable Riggs,
police station, Nullagine.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.611
The two missing half-caste girls
Molly and Daisy

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.803
are returning to Jigalong
via the rabbit-proof fence,

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.640
our efforts to apprehend them
thus far having come to naught.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.331
I therefore expect them
to arrive in Jigalong

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:57.807
in about a month's time.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.002
In your capacity
as local Protector

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.966
you are to proceed to Jigalong
to await their arrival

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.209
and effect their recapture.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:09.243
Yours, etc.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:30.890
No fence.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.407
I want mother.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.881
That fence'll come back.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.808
Home.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.041
It's coming through now.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.481
"Riggs arrived Jigalong."

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.088
"Awaits your instructions."

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.601
Yes, there will be a reply.
Please wait.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.365
"Girls to be send south
via Meekathara."

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.528
"To be accompanied
at all times."

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.448
"Awaiting notification."

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.405
What's all that about?

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.329
Just some women's business.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.528
Been going on all day.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.330
Hey, Molly?

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.728
That tracker.
He not gonna get us now.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.649
No, he not gonna get us.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.041
I'm not going to stay here.
I can feel it.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.888
They're up to something.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.848
I’m going to take a look.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.686
I lost one.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.689
I lost one.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.488
To Constable Riggs,
police station, Nullagine.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.524
At present we lack the funds

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:26.487
to pursue the missing half-caste
girls Molly and Daisy.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:30.889
I would ask to be kept informed
of their whereabouts

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.690
so that at some future date
they may indeed be... recovered.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.526
We face an uphill battle
with these people -

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.007
especially the bush natives,

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:49.920
who have to be protected
against themselves.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.721
If they would only understand

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.767
what we are trying to do
for them.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.842
Tsk! Yours, etc.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.849
Thank you.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.681
<i>We walked for nine weeks,</i>

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.768
<i>a long way, all the way home.</i>

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.126
<i>Then we went straight away
and hid in the desert.</i>

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.768
<i>Got married.
I had two baby girls.</i>

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.442
<i>Then they took me and my kids
back to that Moore River place.</i>

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.769
<i>And I walked all the way
back to Jigalong again,</i>

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.167
<i>carrying Annabella,
the little one.</i>

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.364
<i>When she was three,
that Mr Neville took her away.</i>

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.448
<i>I've never seen her again.</i>

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.767
<i>Gracie is dead now.</i>

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.008
<i>She never made it
back to Jigalong.</i>

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.331
<i>Daisy and me, we're here,</i>

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.444
<i>living in our own country,
Jigalong.</i>

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.766
<i>We're never going back
to that place.</i>
