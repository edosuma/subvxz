01:35.161 --> 01:39.063
Phil: I think that one looks like a fly

01:39.165 --> 01:40.865
who's made of...

01:40.967 --> 01:43.067
white fluffy stuff...

01:43.203 --> 01:45.453
and that's maybe its brother...

01:45.572 --> 01:47.538
and they're best friends...

01:47.624 --> 01:50.074
and they go on adventures together.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.743
Hey, Phil, you ever think about

01:51.828 --> 01:53.268
what you want to be when you grow up?

01:53.296 --> 01:55.580
Nah, man. I'm... I'm
never gonna grow up.

01:55.665 --> 01:57.448
I think I'd like to be a firefly,

01:57.550 --> 01:58.750
be like a hero...

01:58.852 --> 02:00.551
You know, like, help people or whatever.

02:00.654 --> 02:01.886
Dork.

02:01.988 --> 02:03.821
- Come on, man. I was being serious.
- No...

02:03.924 --> 02:04.956
I'm just messing with you, man.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.724
I'm just messing with you. That's...

02:06.826 --> 02:08.960
I just thought I'd be little forever,

02:09.062 --> 02:10.895
kickin' rocks, countin' clouds...

02:10.997 --> 02:12.297
- (door opens)
- Phil's dad: Phillip!

02:12.399 --> 02:13.399
(hiccups)

02:13.500 --> 02:14.999
Get in here now!

02:15.101 --> 02:16.601
I... I... I gotta get going, man.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.770
Hey, um, I... I'll see you later, right?

02:18.872 --> 02:20.271
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you later.

Oh, there you are, Phil.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.620
(chuckles) Check it out.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.120
Uh, my dad oiled my glove last night

02:36.222 --> 02:37.982
and he told me to
sleep on it, so I did and...

02:38.024 --> 02:40.291
- What's... what's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.208
Let's start playing.
Let's go run around and...

02:42.233 --> 02:42.951
Look at me, dude.

02:43.029 --> 02:45.596
- I am looking at you.
- Turn your head.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.566
It's not a big deal, okay?

02:48.668 --> 02:49.734
Let's just play.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.336
(voice cracking) Let's
just play baseball, man.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.439
Hey, you know you can
always stay at my place

02:54.524 --> 02:56.774
whenever you want. Honest.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.344
Thanks, man. (sniffles)

02:59.446 --> 03:00.778
Now let me see the ball.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.331
All right, all right, but I'm

03:02.356 --> 03:04.056
- up first this time, okay?
- Okay.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.702
(slurping)

03:07.821 --> 03:10.288
This is the best thing
I've ever eaten, Mrs. L.

03:10.373 --> 03:12.490
You're, like, the
greatest cook in the world.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.158
It's really good this time, Mom.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.394
You sure are one lucky fly, Mike.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.796
You're welcome here any time, Phil.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.934
Mm. Poor kid.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.802
Phil: So good.

03:34.764 --> 03:37.015
- Huh?
- Oh! Mm-hmm.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.185
(driver clicks tongue)

03:43.523 --> 03:44.989
This guy, right,

03:45.075 --> 03:46.758
- he didn't want to, like, veer off
- Right.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.087
And I'm like, let's go off the

03:48.112 --> 03:49.584
beaten path, man. Mm-hmm. (sighs)

03:49.662 --> 03:51.729
- Let's go see some shit.
- (breathing heavily)

03:51.831 --> 03:53.064
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. All right.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.246
You're, like, squirming. What...
what's going on here?

03:55.268 --> 03:58.403
Ugh. Okay, I know I should
have gone before I left the stables,

03:58.505 --> 04:01.172
but I... I didn't have to,
and now I really have to pee.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.641
Like, my vision is
blurry type of have to pee.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.109
I don't know what to
do because I don't know

04:05.211 --> 04:06.514
how much longer we're gonna be out here.

04:06.539 --> 04:07.269
You don't... Just go.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.747
- Go? On the street? Out here?
- Yeah.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.382
- In public?
- Where else?

04:11.484 --> 04:13.151
"Where else"? I only go in my stable,

04:13.253 --> 04:16.019
where it's dark and it's
warm, and my candles are lit.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.855
What are you talking about?

04:17.957 --> 04:18.957
This is where we go.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.192
The whole world is our toilet.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.361
- N... no.
- That's the beauty of doing what we do.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.329
I have never done
that. What, h... have you?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.665
- All the time. I enjoy it.
- Are you serious?

04:27.767 --> 04:30.902
I see human people pee and
poop in public all the time.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.437
You see human
being... pee and poop... No.

04:32.539 --> 04:33.162
I've never seen that.

04:33.187 --> 04:34.463
Look. Look at that
guy right there. Look.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.770
I can't look. I can't
look with my blinders.

04:35.795 --> 04:36.531
He's peeing. He's peeing.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.342
- I can't see anything. I can't see...
- I...

04:38.445 --> 04:40.102
I hate these fucking
blinders. What is up with that?

04:40.127 --> 04:41.002
They're the fucking worst.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.014
I don't like that people,
like, sneak up on me all the time.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.583
At least make a noise. Clap your

04:44.608 --> 04:46.074
- hands or something,
- Yes! Yes!

04:46.152 --> 04:47.518
- So I see you coming.
- Can't see you coming.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.220
- I can't see you coming.
- I got my blinders on.

04:49.322 --> 04:50.655
- I got my blinders on.
- My blinders on.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.324
- Not blind-hims, mind you. Blind-hers.
- Ah!

04:53.426 --> 04:55.193
- You pick up on that?
- Blind-her.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.500
Patriarchal bullshit. They don't

04:56.525 --> 04:57.855
want us to know what's out there.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.269
No. They want to keep us on the path.

04:59.294 --> 04:59.824
That's right.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.499
The same stupid path.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.568
Fuck. Look at all
this... this shit on me.

05:03.703 --> 05:04.936
Like, what the fuck is
this feather thing?

05:05.038 --> 05:06.604
- What does this do?
- What's the feather adding?

05:06.706 --> 05:07.839
We don't need a fucking feather.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.174
It does nothing except get
in my fucking eyeballs.

05:10.276 --> 05:13.244
- What color is my feather?
- I think it's like a... like a fuchsia?

05:13.346 --> 05:14.412
A f... Oh, Jesus!

05:14.514 --> 05:16.380
We should not be
wearing all of this stuff.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.882
- I mean, look at this.
- Yeah.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.584
My feet are fucking killing me. (clink)

05:19.686 --> 05:20.686
Metal on concrete.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.420
Oh, yeah, that's a comfortable combo.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.021
- Nailed it.
- Literally.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.923
Into our fucking hooves.

05:26.025 --> 05:27.325
(grunts)

05:27.427 --> 05:28.593
I gotta go so bad!

05:28.695 --> 05:30.862
Uh-uh. That's it. I'm
putting my hoof down.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.196
This just not healthy, Anni.

05:32.298 --> 05:33.764
You go to the bathroom right now.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.233
Do it in front of me. I want to see it.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.634
- No.
- Look, I'll go with you.

05:36.736 --> 05:37.802
On the count of three. Come on.

05:37.827 --> 05:38.927
- Let's drop one.
- I don't know.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.671
- Come on. Look at me.
- Drop one? What are we talking?

05:40.773 --> 05:43.574
- We talking one or two?
- Hey, I'mma do a three.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.409
- A one and a two...
- At the same time?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.111
- At the same time.
- That was what I was thinking.

05:47.213 --> 05:48.412
Let's go for it. Come on.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.515
- One...
- Oh, fuck!

05:49.616 --> 05:51.649
- Let it out! Two...
- Oh, fuck you.

05:51.751 --> 05:52.751
Fuck you! You come on.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.353
- Oh...
- Oh, here it comes! Magic time!

05:55.455 --> 05:56.287
- (screams)
- (peeing)

05:56.389 --> 05:58.222
See? You're doing it! You're doing it!

05:58.324 --> 05:59.924
- Look at you!
- This is amazing!

06:00.026 --> 06:01.586
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- This is how the pros do it.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.361
This how the pros do
it. See? Look at that.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.862
Now look, look, look,
look. Here he comes.

06:04.964 --> 06:06.097
See the guy that's a little pale?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.431
Look, I'm a job creator.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.966
- Watch this.
- (pooping)

06:10.036 --> 06:11.502
Bam! He cleaned it right up!

06:11.604 --> 06:13.284
- He cleaned that right up!
- How cool is that?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.207
- That's his job, dude!
- I've never felt so alive!

06:16.309 --> 06:19.443
- Pick my shit up!
- Pick my shit up!

06:19.546 --> 06:20.978
Yeah. Boy, you made a puddle.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.381
- I did. I did.
- Look at all that. Damn!

06:23.483 --> 06:24.515
Jeez.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.321
(ticking)

06:33.159 --> 06:36.160
Get out of here, you fucking jock!

06:36.246 --> 06:38.196
(all laugh)

06:38.298 --> 06:39.397
Phil?

06:39.499 --> 06:41.199
Phil, you know that guy?

06:41.301 --> 06:44.135
Psh. I mean, I used to. Whatever.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.269
We better get going.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.371
You got the cans, right?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.605
Yeah, I got 'em.

06:47.707 --> 06:50.441
We're gonna tag Principal Koharchicks's
house so good!

06:50.543 --> 06:51.792
All: Rad Boys for life!

06:51.878 --> 06:53.544
Rad Boys for life!

06:53.630 --> 06:54.879
(laughter)

06:56.015 --> 06:57.098
(sighs)

06:58.718 --> 07:00.768
(police radio chatter)

07:03.723 --> 07:05.623
To be honest, I
didn't think you'd pick up.

07:05.725 --> 07:06.725
Hmph.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.486
Tell your parents I
said thanks for the bail.

07:08.561 --> 07:09.794
Of... of course, man.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.329
You know they'd always look out for you.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.530
Yeah. Right.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.166
All right, man. I guess
I'll see you around then.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.934
Hey, uh, Phil?

07:17.036 --> 07:18.102
Yeah, Mike?

07:18.204 --> 07:20.304
What are you doing right now?

07:20.406 --> 07:21.672
Hard cut.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.507
And do you remember the bottle?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.343
How... Of course I remember the bottle.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.611
You almost fell off it too

07:26.713 --> 07:29.113
I didn't fall. and you
would've if I didn't catch you.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.581
That was... We were crazy.

07:30.683 --> 07:32.016
Those were the minutes, man.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.217
No, but seriously, man,

07:33.319 --> 07:34.919
it's great to hear you got into Cornell.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.587
You're gonna knock it out of the park.

07:36.689 --> 07:37.689
Thanks, man.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.790
But you were always set on a path.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.659
You know, you had it all figured out.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.095
I guess it's just easier for some people

07:44.197 --> 07:45.197
than others, huh?

07:45.231 --> 07:46.530
Well, uh, what about you?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.073
I mean, are... are you still writing?

07:48.167 --> 07:49.300
Uh, writing, uh...

07:49.402 --> 07:50.968
I gave that shit up a while ago.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.170
- It was a pipe dream.
- What are you talking about?

07:53.273 --> 07:55.306
You were the best in
our class by an inch.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.488
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.976
- You're just gonna give up?
- I'm not giving up.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.045
Yes. You're gonna live in
this two-horsefly town

08:01.147 --> 08:03.047
- for the rest of your life.
- I'm not doing that.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.469
You're gonna drink your life away
just like your father did.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.952
I'm not gonna be my father!

08:08.054 --> 08:09.054
(grunts)

08:09.088 --> 08:11.022
(grunts)

08:12.158 --> 08:13.591
Then prove it.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.363
Stupid... Tell me I'm my father.

08:19.465 --> 08:20.531
I'm not my father.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.133
You're an idiot, Phil.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.068
Fucking idiot.

08:26.472 --> 08:27.638
- Come here!
- (giggles)

08:27.724 --> 08:28.973
I'm gonna get you!

08:29.058 --> 08:30.141
(giggles)

08:30.226 --> 08:31.475
You're gettin' heavy!

08:31.611 --> 08:33.376
Oh, my God! Wh... what'd you find?

08:33.479 --> 08:34.839
- Okay. On my way back.
- What is that?

08:34.847 --> 08:35.813
You've got something on your face.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.308
Of course, sir. I'll be sure to get

08:37.317 --> 08:39.150
the Takahashi
account in order by tomorrow.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.284
- Mike?
- Huh?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.619
Mike, hey! Over here!

08:41.721 --> 08:43.287
No way.

08:43.373 --> 08:45.656
Phil Matarese. Is that
who I'm looking at?

08:45.758 --> 08:46.758
Get over here!

08:46.859 --> 08:47.958
- Hi, man.
- Oh, my God.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.361
- It's so good to see you.
- How long has it been even?

08:50.463 --> 08:51.762
- Ah, it's been a minute.
- You look good.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.764
- Oh, come on.
- And who is this right here?

08:53.866 --> 08:55.333
Oh, this is my son, Aiden.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.634
Aiden, say hi to a friend of mine.

08:56.736 --> 08:57.935
- This is Mike.
- Hi.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.204
Well, hello there,
Aiden. If you can believe it,

09:00.306 --> 09:01.872
your old man and I became friends

09:01.974 --> 09:03.307
when we were just about your age.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.609
Really? You guys are old.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.792
- (both chuckle)
- Oh, my gosh.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.146
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

09:09.248 --> 09:10.481
So what are you doing in town?

09:10.583 --> 09:12.483
I haven't seen you since
you moved to the city.

09:12.585 --> 09:13.818
Uh... Mom.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.486
She, uh... she's caught a bug.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.621
- Oh.
- Nothing too serious. You know her.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.724
- Yeah.
- But, um...

09:18.758 --> 09:20.624
Well, I'm sorry to hear, man.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.927
Hey, let's get some
coffee. You know, I'm about

09:23.029 --> 09:24.013
to drop Aiden off with his mom

09:24.038 --> 09:25.086
- and I figure it'd be...
- Uh...

09:25.164 --> 09:27.832
you know, I'm... I was
actually on my way to catch a train.

09:27.934 --> 09:31.102
Mike, there will be another train.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.204
And no one's ever sold

09:32.338 --> 09:33.183
that many shares in the

09:33.208 --> 09:34.138
- company's history.
- Wow.

09:34.173 --> 09:35.884
Yeah. Needless to say, that corner

09:35.909 --> 09:37.766
office is looking pretty good, so...

09:37.810 --> 09:39.143
That's really good to hear, man.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.405
I'm happy you're doing great.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.246
It seems like you got it all on track.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.914
Thanks, man. It's pretty awesome.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.082
- Yeah.
- So, anyway, man,

09:45.184 --> 09:47.251
how's the small town life treating you?

09:47.353 --> 09:48.686
What's new in Phil's world?

09:48.788 --> 09:51.288
Uh, well, you know Rustic Plum Books?

09:51.391 --> 09:52.711
The bookstore in the rotting plum.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.426
You own Rustic Plum
Books?! That's a great...

09:55.528 --> 09:57.208
Dude, I could get
you a small business loan

09:57.230 --> 09:58.299
that would double the size of it.

09:58.324 --> 09:59.454
- I'm telling you.
- No, I actually...

09:59.532 --> 10:02.299
No, no. I... I'm just
a part-time manger there.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.802
Um, but it's good seconds.

10:04.904 --> 10:05.904
You know, and it's...

10:05.972 --> 10:08.005
it's a lot of responsibility and...

10:09.108 --> 10:11.308
I'm happy, you know?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.243
Well, that's...

10:12.345 --> 10:14.211
that's good, Phil. Good for you.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.613
Yeah.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.215
Hey, um, you know, it's
actually getting close to train time.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.050
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I...
I'll walk you over.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.685
Do you mind gettin'...

10:21.788 --> 10:24.121
- Oh, uh...
- Sorry. It's cash only too so...

10:24.223 --> 10:25.309
Mm-hmm. That's what I was thinking.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.147
Okay. They have an ATM...

10:26.225 --> 10:27.271
Yeah, yeah, I'll go. I'll head

10:27.296 --> 10:28.516
- over to the ATM.
- if you need it.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.494
It's $3.00 fee.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.596
Oh, my God. It wasn't
even fully rotted yet.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.058
Like, what... what... was it a raven?

10:34.133 --> 10:36.150
Or I feel like it was maybe
a crow 'cause that...

10:36.269 --> 10:37.568
Yeah, it was a crow.

10:41.369 --> 10:42.573
Hey, come on, man.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.342
Let's... let's keep going, huh?

10:45.445 --> 10:49.113
I can still remember the
smell of whiskey on his breath.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.081
The way spit would fly from his mouth

10:51.184 --> 10:53.250
like it was a warm mist when he'd yell,

10:53.352 --> 10:54.919
"You ain't gonna amount to nothin', boy!

10:55.021 --> 10:58.622
"You belong in the
gutter just like me and my pa

10:58.724 --> 11:00.624
and his pa before him," and I'd say,

11:00.726 --> 11:02.693
"But I ain't like you, Daddy!

11:02.795 --> 11:05.629
I may have your blood and
I might have your wings,

11:05.731 --> 11:09.533
but dog as my witness, I
will never be like you...

11:09.635 --> 11:10.701
(breathing heavily)

11:10.803 --> 11:12.102
as long as I live."

11:13.189 --> 11:14.271
Hey, Phil.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.411
(grunts)

11:20.513 --> 11:22.480
(shattering)

11:22.565 --> 11:24.815
(chuckles) You do it.

11:24.951 --> 11:25.951
(grunts)

11:25.952 --> 11:27.318
- Good one.
- (chuckles)

11:27.487 --> 11:28.953
(both grunt)

11:29.055 --> 11:30.375
You hit the wi...
you hit the top window.

11:30.400 --> 11:30.815
Yeah.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.373
- (grunts)
- Whoa!

11:32.492 --> 11:34.658
- You still got it, dude.
- Did you see that?

11:34.744 --> 11:36.660
- Oh!
- What did I tell you?

11:36.746 --> 11:39.246
Nice. I wanna try too.

14:38.221 --> 14:43.452
_

14:50.239 --> 14:53.223
Honey, I am so sorry for your loss.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.383
No wife wants to see her husband in

14:55.408 --> 14:57.351
- pain like this.
- Thanks, sweetie.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.829
But I can't get, like, any Wi-Fi

14:58.931 --> 15:01.532
in this freaking
town, so can we go soon?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.634
We at least have to make
an appearance at the wake.

15:03.669 --> 15:04.789
I thought this was the wake.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.084
No, this is... this is the burial.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.871
Well, how many times do
you have to bury this guy?

15:07.973 --> 15:09.693
- Okay, well, it's my Mom. Um...
- (phone chimes)

15:09.709 --> 15:10.817
We'll head back to the city

15:10.842 --> 15:11.949
- in a bit, okay?
- (groans)

15:12.044 --> 15:13.677
Where's the bathroom?

15:21.187 --> 15:22.436
I mean, I know she's younger,

15:22.555 --> 15:24.054
- but I really do love her.
- Yeah.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.779
It was actually Eliza's idea to get

15:25.804 --> 15:27.215
our vacation condo in Hoboken.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.358
- Right.
- Five square inches.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.461
- Pretty nice.
- Yeah.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.228
Plus, she's an
absolute freak in the sack.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.730
- (chuckles)
- (chuckles awkwardly)

15:32.832 --> 15:35.091
So anyway, how's your boy, um...

15:35.116 --> 15:36.457
- Alan?
- Oh. Aiden.

15:36.535 --> 15:37.634
- Aiden. Aiden.
- Yeah.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.103
He's in rehab actually.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.405
- So sorry. Um...
- It's fine.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.033
Eliza actually just got out

15:43.058 --> 15:44.866
- of a third stint herself.
- Oh.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.877
And I got her quite the graduation ring.

15:46.979 --> 15:47.979
Eliza!

15:48.047 --> 15:49.413
Honey, show him the ring!

15:49.515 --> 15:51.415
- Eliza?
- Well, fuck you, Charlene.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.550
Oh, God, I fucking hate
you, you fucking bitch.

15:53.652 --> 15:54.918
But you know what? You
tell it like it is

15:55.020 --> 15:56.420
and that's why I love
you, you crazy bitch.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.388
- She's on the phone it looks like.
- She's still on her phone.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.424
Oh, God, and we just put
in a racquetball court

16:00.526 --> 16:01.886
in our place in the Upper East Side

16:01.894 --> 16:03.144
and oh, my God,
the zoning costs alone...

16:03.169 --> 16:03.585
Mike, I'm...

16:03.662 --> 16:05.729
Mike, I'm sorry, dude, is
this all you want to talk about?

16:05.831 --> 16:07.231
Like y... like your... your stuff

16:07.333 --> 16:08.773
and all these things that you bought?

16:08.868 --> 16:10.734
What happened to that kid
that wanted to help people?

16:10.836 --> 16:12.536
The kid who wanted to be a firefly?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.905
A firefly? (chuckles)

16:15.007 --> 16:16.407
I... I'm sorry. Don't get me started

16:16.509 --> 16:18.408
on those union crooks, okay?

16:18.511 --> 16:20.277
Bunch of bums sitting on their tuchuses

16:20.379 --> 16:22.246
getting paid from my tax dollars.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.615
- No thank you.
- You've changed, Mike.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.049
No, Phil. I grew up.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.451
Something you still haven't done.

16:27.553 --> 16:28.852
It's not 10:00 a.m. anymore, man.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.888
Let me tell you something. You
know what your problem is?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.256
You're stuck in the past.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.390
Yeah.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.092
Yeah, maybe I am.

16:35.177 --> 16:36.877
What... what's this?

16:36.962 --> 16:38.796
See you around, Mike.

16:43.411 --> 16:47.288
_

16:47.289 --> 16:48.856
Son of a bitch did it.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.808
(both laughing)

16:50.893 --> 16:52.526
Come get me, man!

16:52.645 --> 16:53.645
I'm gonna get you!

16:53.779 --> 16:55.679
Mike! Mike, over here!

16:55.781 --> 16:57.781
(both laugh)

17:09.295 --> 17:10.828
Young Phil: And that's when I knew

17:10.930 --> 17:12.329
all you really need is...

17:12.431 --> 17:13.896
Old Phil: one good friend

17:13.999 --> 17:16.300
to get you through a bad day.

17:17.386 --> 17:19.051
Ah.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.339
(ticking)

17:26.060 --> 17:30.714
You know, I never did get
the author to sign my copy.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.549
Hey, Mike.

17:32.651 --> 17:36.220
Holy cow, a first edition.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.222
I haven't seen one of these in a while.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.958
Have a seat, you old fart.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.359
(coughs) Get over here.

17:42.461 --> 17:43.627
(groans)

17:43.729 --> 17:45.128
Oh, boy.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.363
(farts)

17:46.465 --> 17:48.131
Not much today.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.234
I see that.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.501
So how's your son, Aiden?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.437
Oh, he's an optometrist.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.905
He's an... he's an optometrist?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.974
He's got a family of his own now.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.877
Doesn't visit the puddle much.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.946
I guess that's just the way it goes.

18:03.048 --> 18:06.550
How's that wife of yours, Eliza?

18:06.652 --> 18:07.951
Eliza?

18:08.053 --> 18:10.153
She left me a while ago

18:10.256 --> 18:12.189
along with most of my money.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.157
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.592
Oh, don't be.

18:15.694 --> 18:16.774
If she hadn't have left me,

18:16.862 --> 18:21.031
I wouldn't have found my
true love, JaiYing Li.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.532
We met at bingo night

18:22.635 --> 18:25.068
at the volunteer firefly station,

18:25.170 --> 18:26.370
if you can believe it.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.305
Oh, she's a flower.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.874
Delicate as they come.

18:30.976 --> 18:34.077
Really is quiet around here.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.246
Beautiful though.

18:36.348 --> 18:40.417
Old friend, if you
could do it all over again,

18:40.519 --> 18:42.619
would you change anything?

18:42.721 --> 18:46.189
Not a Goddamn second of it.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.761
Well, I should be heading back now.

18:50.863 --> 18:54.197
JaiYing is making soup for dinner.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.005
Get in here.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.074
Get in here.

19:07.379 --> 19:11.214
Well, I guess this is
goodbye, old friend.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.883
I suppose so.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.584
Maybe...

19:14.687 --> 19:16.353
maybe I'll see you tomorrow.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.755
I'd like that.

19:18.857 --> 19:21.058
Me too.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.262
Oh, don't trip over that
fucking thing there.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.347
Fuck you. I got it.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.726
Whoa! Dude, dude, come
here. I think I found something.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.480
- Whoa! Why is it burnt?
- Who cares, man? Look at her!

19:43.582 --> 19:45.248
- Dang!
- Oh, man!

19:45.351 --> 19:47.217
- Oh, my God, dude.
- Oh, shh. Don't tell anybody.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.652
- Okay.
- This is ours, okay?

19:48.754 --> 19:50.053
Dude, give it to me, man. Give it to me.

19:50.078 --> 19:50.711
No, give it to me.

19:50.789 --> 19:52.149
No. I... I found it. It's mine now.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.358
You tore it, you big freaking idiot.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.377
I'm gonna go home and
just look at it, I guess.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.416
