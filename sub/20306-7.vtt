WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:02.669
(chattering)

00:02.752 --> 00:06.923
Item five. Floyd Green comes home today.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.341
(sarcastically) Oh, great.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.719
Mr. Green has been gone for five years

00:10.802 --> 00:14.347
for the murders of Willie Smith
and Janet Sanchez.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.599
Mr. Green was 13 at the time.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.351
His apparent motive-- boredom.

00:19.185 --> 00:24.107
Since today is his 18th birthday,
in our juvie system's infinite wisdom,

00:24.190 --> 00:26.568
he's being put back on the streets.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.528
Maybe we should throw him
a birthday party, huh?

00:28.611 --> 00:30.530
(laughing)

00:30.613 --> 00:34.951
At his trial, and periodically thereafter,
Mr. Green issued certain threats

00:35.035 --> 00:37.662
against certain people
who testified against him.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.831
State Youth Authority's
bringing him here today

00:39.914 --> 00:43.585
so the Captain can wish him
many happy returns of the day.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.129
Be alert, because when he leaves here,

00:46.212 --> 00:48.381
Mr. Green might try to make good
on some of those threats.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.842
I want that animal's butt
covered wall to wall.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.719
(indistinct chatter)

00:52.802 --> 00:54.095
Next item--

00:54.387 --> 00:58.725
Extradition proceedings are complete
for the return of Joseph "Latex" Flaherty.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.896
He's one of the Tri-State's most
prolific rubber-check artists.

01:03.438 --> 01:07.150
Detective Belker hops
tonight's red-eye to Las Vegas.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.071
Pursuant to which,
he asks that all paperwork

01:11.154 --> 01:13.907
on the Three Legs undercover
be in by noon,

01:13.990 --> 01:16.493
as he has primary
record-keeping responsibility,

01:16.576 --> 01:19.788
and we're gonna be deprived
of his smiling presence

01:19.871 --> 01:21.831
for approximately 27 hours.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.541
Lucky stiff. What a waste.

01:23.625 --> 01:27.545
Sarge, you know, sending Belker to Vegas
is like sending Mother Teresa.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.216
(laughter)

01:31.299 --> 01:33.593
Item-- Operation Bummer--

01:34.094 --> 01:36.304
Uh, the epidemic of bums being rolled

01:36.387 --> 01:40.391
in the vicinity of the 130th Street
overpass continues.

01:40.642 --> 01:44.187
Uh, Detectives Washington
and LaRue remain out there

01:44.270 --> 01:47.565
to nail that crumbum who's responsible.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.527
(indistinct chatter)

01:50.610 --> 01:53.363
All right, uh, item, um, item eight--

01:54.531 --> 01:58.618
As of today,
your 914 salmons are obsolete,

01:59.327 --> 02:03.164
to be replaced by your, uh, 711 khakis.

02:03.748 --> 02:08.419
Your 513 quadruplets
are now 513 triplicates.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.464
-MAN: What?
-Uh, well, throw away that last carbon.

02:11.965 --> 02:18.763
Also, as of today,
all officers must file a 511-A

02:19.139 --> 02:21.933
in any accident involving
two or more vehicles

02:22.016 --> 02:25.770
in which one or more of those vehicles
have out-of-state plates.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.315
So you throw out the, um...
you throw out the--

02:29.399 --> 02:31.568
Throw out the last, uh,
carbon in the 513s.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.653
-RENKO: The 513s.
-Yeah. Okay.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.657
Item nine--
Corrections Local 373 has settled.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.117
The strike is off.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.869
-Yay!
-Yay!

02:40.952 --> 02:45.248
That means that any of you who
have been voluntarily selected

02:45.331 --> 02:47.542
to drive the corrections' transport buses,

02:47.625 --> 02:50.253
you can stop boning up
for your chauffeur's license.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.088
Okay.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.215
Let's make it a good day.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.219
Let's get out there, let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.639
(indistinct conversations)

03:05.393 --> 03:06.936
Yeah, I'll wait for you
in the unit, all right?

03:07.020 --> 03:07.854
You got it.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.275
Sarge, I'm gonna need a couple hours
personal time this morning.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.986
-What for?
-I'm being audited for last year's taxes.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.655
Only a couple of hours? Dream on, dreamer.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.325
Keep an eye on this for me,
will you, Natalie?

03:20.408 --> 03:21.826
-Oh, sure, Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.369
Are you sure?

03:23.453 --> 03:26.915
Hey, I think flying is about the safest
form of transportation around today.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.917
Yeah, uh, what about at night?

03:29.334 --> 03:30.543
-You're kidding.
-No.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.962
Hey, Mick, they got lights,
they got instruments.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.716
You know, I'll bet they don't lose
more than two, three planes a year

03:36.799 --> 03:38.509
in those mountains behind Las Vegas.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.553
RAY: ...these canceled checks.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.640
Did you write on each receipt
what the receipt is for?

03:43.723 --> 03:45.808
-No, not really.
-Well, they will want that.

03:45.892 --> 03:50.271
And if you're going to fill them out now,
use different pens-- at least three.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.397
-Three?
-Yes.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.235
Morning, Captain. I need your signature
on Belker's Las Vegas voucher.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.612
Uh, Capt-- Excuse me. Captain,
look, it's none of my business,

03:57.695 --> 03:59.781
you know,
but Belker's terrified of flying.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.699
Guy's got white knuckles
just thinking about it, now...

04:01.783 --> 04:04.327
-I was wondering, maybe, look, maybe--
-No, J.D., no.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.080
-(shouting in Spanish)
-MICK: Hey, shut up!

04:07.163 --> 04:08.539
(shouting in Spanish)

04:08.623 --> 04:11.167
Lieutenant, would you tell
these guys to shut up, please?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.294
-Shut up!
-(shouting continues)

04:13.378 --> 04:14.212
Hey!

04:14.295 --> 04:17.340
(shouting continues)

04:24.847 --> 04:27.225
-Hey! Hey!
-(shouting)

04:27.308 --> 04:28.810
Hey! Hey! Settle down!

04:28.893 --> 04:30.812
Hey! Hey!

04:30.895 --> 04:32.397
Hey! Stop--

04:34.399 --> 04:35.984
-(shouting in Spanish)
-Get in there!

04:41.990 --> 04:44.075
These snowballs are as flat as a pancake.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.372
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:49.455 --> 04:51.207
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:51.291 --> 04:54.961
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:55.044 --> 04:56.713
(sirens wailing)

05:02.176 --> 05:04.804
(theme music playing)

06:41.484 --> 06:42.527
Thank you, sir.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.030
Hey, excuse me, bro!

06:46.447 --> 06:47.782
Hey, good time, my man.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.784
Police. Uh-huh.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.285
Hey! Hold it. Hold it!

06:53.955 --> 06:56.374
-(grunting, shouting)
-Come on!

06:56.457 --> 06:59.877
Hey, I'm not a serious criminal, Officer,
despite what you might find here.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.630
Wait a minute. Uh-oh!

07:03.381 --> 07:05.383
Hey, man. Airline tickets.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.510
-Where'd you get these?
-Must've rolled a flyin' bum.

07:07.593 --> 07:11.514
No, sir, I just deliver!
Those tickets are not offers.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.391
I know a man who has
a million of 'em, okay?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.518
I mean, why should I take a fall?

07:15.601 --> 07:18.104
Hey, no, sir. I value my freedom too much.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.648
Hey, besides, we could make a deal.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.108
Those are<i> open </i>airline--

07:22.191 --> 07:23.776
Hey, dial it back now, my man!

07:23.860 --> 07:25.486
Unless you wanna tack on
bribery to your sheet.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.571
-No, no.
-Neal, Neal.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.197
-Listen to the man a moment.
-J.D.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.657
-Imagine, if you will, Neal...
-No.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.577
...swimming pools, deep sunshine
on heat-starved bodies,

07:32.660 --> 07:33.578
bikini-clad women,

07:33.661 --> 07:35.580
the distinctive click
of the roulette wheel.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.415
-Yeah!
-N-O, J.D.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.499
Vegas, man.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.293
We are talking about Las Vegas, Nevada--

07:40.376 --> 07:42.712
the fun capital
of the entire Western world.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.380
-Oh, go for it, brother.
-Forget it, J.D.!

07:44.464 --> 07:46.382
-And you have the right to remain silent.
-Oh, no.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.967
If you give up the right to remain silent,

07:48.050 --> 07:50.344
anything you say can
and will be held against you...

07:51.012 --> 07:54.307
Leo? Mr. Pescator's on intake
with me today.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.310
-No P.D., Mr. Pescator?
-Court-appointed.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.646
Uh, Luis Escobedo
or Salvatore Muñoz's assault.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.647
What's that mean?

08:02.190 --> 08:06.110
It means, Ms. Davenport and I
haven't decided who's taking who.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.239
Uh, I believe some outstanding warrants
have fallen on Mr. Escobedo.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.701
Right-- Escobedo's in "A,"
Muñoz is in "B."

08:15.244 --> 08:17.788
I'll flip you
for the one without the warrants.

08:18.080 --> 08:18.915
-MAN: I saw...
-Thanks, Leo.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.502
I saw Floyd Green put a gun to
my niece's heart and kill her, Lieutenant.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.254
So not in five years, not in 20,
could I ever put that out of my mind.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.591
Mr. Sanchez, that's not by any
means what I'm asking you to do.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.510
But then to have to bear
the constant threats

08:30.593 --> 08:32.595
of that animal against me and the others!

08:32.678 --> 08:34.180
Do you think they don't get back to us?

08:34.263 --> 08:38.017
Mr. Sanchez, I'm only trying to find a way
to manage a difficult situation.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.228
Which our neighborhood watch
is willing to provide.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.190
Only if you understand that any suggestion
of a vigilante action on your--

08:45.149 --> 08:47.610
-Mr. Sanchez.
-(indistinct shouting)

08:47.693 --> 08:48.569
Mr. Johnson.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.571
Great. This is Floyd Green.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.490
Yes, I remember.
In my office, would you, please?

08:52.573 --> 08:54.158
-Henry?
-Still alive, Clive?

08:54.242 --> 08:55.826
Yes, I'm still alive!

08:56.202 --> 08:57.995
Come on. Come on!

08:59.163 --> 09:01.165
The life and times
of Floyd Green, Captain.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.252
He says this address
is his place of residence upon release.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.212
Your cousin's apartment is in my precinct.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.965
This is the last time
I ever want to see you, Floyd.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.300
The court says you start
with a clean slate.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.135
Far as I'm concerned,
you get no slack at all.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.345
Don't even jaywalk.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.721
(sighs)

09:15.805 --> 09:17.723
Bad attitude could cost you, too, Floyd.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.184
Hey, man, I'm cool. I'm a citizen.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.353
I paid for my deeds.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.313
Now if somebody want to
get in my face about that,

09:24.397 --> 09:26.065
then they gonna pay for their deeds.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.191
That a threat, Floyd?

09:28.317 --> 09:30.570
You're not a free adult
till nine o'clock, Floyd.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.405
You pay attention to these gentlemen.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.699
Man, the two minutes mean
that much to you, fine.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.826
Early release. Get out of here.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.412
All yours, Captain.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.206
(door opens)

09:44.208 --> 09:45.876
-Class act.
-FRANK: Stay on it.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.588
Let him see you.
He gives you any reason at all, roust him.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.548
-He gets no rhythm. None.
-You got it.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.343
Neighborhood patrol brought a list
of Green's friends, his old hangouts.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.762
They're anxious to help.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.015
-I'll coordinate.
-Okay, stay close.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.642
I don't want any vendettas
coming from either direction.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.560
Yeah.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.690
Mr. Escobedo, to avoid any
potential conflict of interest

10:07.773 --> 10:10.026
with your co-defendant in these charges,

10:10.109 --> 10:13.487
I'll be representing Mr. Muñoz,
Mr. Pescator will be representing--

10:13.571 --> 10:15.906
Yeah, I know, I know.
That's standard procedure, lady.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.575
-I know.
-Just so you know.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.994
What I wanna know is
how come Tony gets<i> you,</i>

10:21.078 --> 10:23.831
and I gotta get this, uh, Mr. Whatsis?

10:24.540 --> 10:25.499
Listen, mister.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.419
I spent three years
in the district attorney's office

10:28.502 --> 10:29.962
putting people like you away...

10:30.421 --> 10:33.549
and I'm certainly capable 10 years later
of keeping people like you out.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.177
Mr. Escobedo.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.639
-Any questions, I'm available.
-Oh, fine, thanks.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.558
I should be able to find it
between the covers. Thanks.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.232
Mr. Escobedo, now, about this assault...

10:50.316 --> 10:51.150
(door closes)

10:52.234 --> 10:53.903
Any, uh, particular reason

10:53.986 --> 10:58.449
you and Mr. Muñoz went after
these women with a tire iron?

10:58.532 --> 11:01.327
Because they was ugly, man.
They was in my face.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.455
-Hey, what's your name again?
-Pescator.

11:04.914 --> 11:09.085
<i>Oh, Dios, bendita santísima...</i>
<i>Pescado, un pescado...</i>

11:09.418 --> 11:11.629
I need a lawyer, they bring me a fish.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.674
(sighing) You know,
I have a sense of humor,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.093
and I have a temper, too.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.679
And I don't do this kind
of work for my health.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.890
Now, just answer my questions
like a good boy.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.308
Is that all right?

11:28.771 --> 11:29.730
It means "fisherman."

11:30.690 --> 11:32.149
I can't believe how cheap this dude is!

11:32.233 --> 11:34.068
Plus, he promised me a ticket
so I could go to Carolina

11:34.151 --> 11:35.236
and bury my mama, right?

11:35.319 --> 11:37.697
And did he come through with it?
No, he did not!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.740
So you tell me, what do I owe him?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.951
-Not a damn thing!
-Leo! Leo!

11:42.034 --> 11:43.703
Print this guy and muzzle him. Come on.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.288
...man's got stolen away!
I mean, he's a major major!

11:46.372 --> 11:48.332
Later, my man, we're gonna
try to make a deal here.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.418
Now just shut up
and remain that way, all right?

11:50.501 --> 11:53.921
Sergeant Bates, Coffey,
this woman's busting my chops.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.757
Petty larceny at the Superette,
Vanhorn and 23rd--

11:56.841 --> 12:00.344
A regular John Dillinger.
Probably swiped a quart of milk.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.847
-BOY: Give me a break!
-WOMAN: Are you crazy? I said no!

12:02.930 --> 12:04.306
BOY: Come on, lady, give me a break.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.642
No, you stole from me,
and you're gonna learn your lesson!

12:06.726 --> 12:08.561
-You old witch!
-You little twerp!

12:08.644 --> 12:10.438
And this time, I'm prosecuting!

12:10.521 --> 12:12.523
-These kids are cleaning me out!
-All right.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.358
Look, ma'am, if the boy stole something,

12:14.442 --> 12:16.318
we usually just take him home
and tell his parents.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.071
Oh, not this time!
Look at all the stuff he lifted!

12:19.405 --> 12:20.573
My clerk is concerned.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.408
He sees blood dripping down his hand,

12:22.491 --> 12:24.326
he lifts up his arm
and out comes a chicken!

12:24.410 --> 12:26.370
Okay, well, at least
you got all the stuff back.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.955
I can't sell this. It's squashed!

12:28.038 --> 12:30.458
Excuse me, uh, is that the bird
you want me to rewrap?

12:33.836 --> 12:36.672
All right.
All right, you get him out of here.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.717
But I see your face back here again
and I break your fingers!

12:42.636 --> 12:43.554
What's your name?

12:44.597 --> 12:45.556
Where do you live?

12:47.308 --> 12:49.852
Look, kid, either we take
you home or we take you in.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.105
All right. Come on. Let's go.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.319
-This is it.
-(woman arguing)

13:02.281 --> 13:03.115
So?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.702
-Where's your mother?
-Ain't here now.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.537
Well, when is she gonna be here?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.206
I don't know. Could be a while.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.082
(laughter)

13:12.958 --> 13:14.251
Uh-oh...

13:14.835 --> 13:15.920
gotta run.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.464
<i>-Auf wiedersehen, </i>baby.
-Hey, come back here!

13:18.547 --> 13:19.715
You chump!

13:23.052 --> 13:24.220
So, what y'all want here?

13:24.303 --> 13:25.763
We're waiting to see this boy's mother.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.972
About what?

13:27.056 --> 13:29.266
About shoplifting. Who are you?

13:29.350 --> 13:32.186
I'm his sister.
You see what you done done now?

13:32.269 --> 13:34.396
You're just mad 'cause I cost you a trick.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.982
-Shut up, Fabian!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.404
(coughs, laughs)

13:45.324 --> 13:46.742
Do you feel like gambling?
Whoa, wait, pal.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.702
-What for, man?
-Oh, did you have a good breakfast?

13:48.786 --> 13:51.372
You know, a good breakfast is
the foundation for a happy, healthy day.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.874
Mm-mm, baby, that feels good.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.043
You like that action, huh?
You take your time.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.837
-That feels good.
-What's this, Floyd?

13:57.920 --> 14:01.257
Oh, no, Floyd-- a joint?
Now, nutritionally speaking,

14:01.340 --> 14:03.425
-this is no way to start your day.
-What's this jive?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.928
-Shut up! You're busted.
-Yo, bro! Huh?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.471
You have the right to remain silent.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.640
-If you give up your right...
-Damn roach, man!

14:09.723 --> 14:13.894
-(shouting indistinctly)
-Stay calm, huh?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.896
-(shouting continues)
-Stay calm!

14:15.980 --> 14:19.692
(indistinct shouting)

14:19.775 --> 14:22.319
-Let that boy go!
-Hey, I said that's enough!

14:22.403 --> 14:24.446
(indistinct)

14:24.530 --> 14:25.906
All right, go, go, go, go!

14:25.990 --> 14:27.783
(tires squeal)

14:27.867 --> 14:31.787
(shouting continues)

14:35.124 --> 14:36.542
MAN: Light scissors, Anthony.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.627
The wrist is just like a hummingbird,
<i>capisce?</i>

14:38.711 --> 14:40.921
-MAN 2: Right here.
-MAN: That's good. That's good.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.674
Police. Charles Morris work here?

14:43.757 --> 14:46.093
I don't see him. Keep it even, Tony.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.053
What time do you expect him
to become visible?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.264
He's in, he's out.
What, did he give you a bad shoeshine?

14:50.347 --> 14:52.433
MAN 2: Hey, hey! Look at these Dumbo ears!

14:52.516 --> 14:54.602
-Ahh! That's it!
-Sorry! I'm sorry. Sorry.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.395
You gotta hold his head still, Tony.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.438
You gotta know what you're doing!

14:57.521 --> 15:00.107
I come in for a trim,
and now I'm a circus freak!

15:00.190 --> 15:02.401
Hey, this is the best
two-buck haircut in town,

15:02.484 --> 15:03.652
and he's my top trainee.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.571
MAN 2: He's a lawn mower, not a barber!

15:05.654 --> 15:07.740
Oh. And you're a male model, huh, bub?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.409
Pay up, bub! The cops like to see you pay!

15:10.492 --> 15:12.536
Oh, not for a scalping, you fraud!

15:12.620 --> 15:14.788
Hey, like it or not, mister,
you gotta pay for the service.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.165
The tip is up to you.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.875
Don't worry,<i> paisan.</i>
We'll get the next one.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.628
TONY: Next!

15:20.920 --> 15:22.630
-Charlie Morris!
-Hey.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.882
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-What's goin' on, man?

15:24.965 --> 15:26.467
I'll have you dancing
out of here in no time.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.676
Police. Got a warrant to search your body.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.594
Hey, what's going on?

15:28.677 --> 15:30.012
-Sorry, Charlie.
-Stinking pigs!

15:30.095 --> 15:32.514
-Oh, lookie here! Lookie here!
-What you got?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.308
-One way to Felonyland.
-Oh, my.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.560
-Who did me? Who ruined me?
-You did, sucker.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.687
You are under arrest for possession
of stolen property.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.231
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

15:41.315 --> 15:44.443
Payments on your mother's mortgage
as a charitable deduction, disallowed.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.987
Also, what's this office space at home?

15:47.071 --> 15:49.156
What kind of office work
does a policeman do at home?

15:49.239 --> 15:52.159
Sir, see, police officers have to work
at home at night on their papers.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.452
-At home.
-At night.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.245
I don't find the letter
to that effect from the city.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.163
Disallowed.

15:56.455 --> 16:00.376
Besides which, you deducted
$40,000 gambling losses?

16:00.459 --> 16:02.962
It's straight out of the code--
losses deductible

16:03.045 --> 16:04.964
-up to equivalent winnings.
-HILL: That's right.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.341
How long have you been
an accountant, Mr. Blatz?

16:07.424 --> 16:09.927
Regs require appropriate receipts.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.887
They don't give receipts
at a floating crap game.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.599
Losses incurred due to illegal gambling
are nondeductible-- Disallowed.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.561
If you don't mind my saying so, sir,
this government makes people into thieves.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.604
-No wonder people take...
-Andy.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.231
...twice what they're entitled to

16:22.314 --> 16:24.566
when you're just gonna
disallow most of it back!

16:24.650 --> 16:25.943
-Andy!
-No, you wait a minute.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.069
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.655
You take your average,
hard-working police officers.

16:29.738 --> 16:33.534
Now, the restaurants on his beat
occasionally will tear up his tab.

16:33.617 --> 16:37.204
But do you think he's gonna declare that?
No, sir. Do you know why?

16:37.287 --> 16:39.957
Because of this hard attitude
he's gonna get from you people.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.501
He<i> knows </i>he's going to encounter that.
Am I right?

16:42.710 --> 16:46.338
Let's see, that's, uh, five meals
a week, five bucks a meal times...

16:46.422 --> 16:47.756
-Nice going, Andy.
-No, sir. No, s--

16:47.840 --> 16:50.134
-No, don't.
-Hey. Just kidding.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.636
Nobody's here to slice and dice anybody.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.388
Well, how much are we
talking about, Mr. Stone?

16:55.305 --> 16:57.349
Twelve-thousand, plus interest
and charges, of course.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.643
-Twelve-thousand?
-Twelve-thousand dollars?

16:59.727 --> 17:03.105
-You can pay on time, 170 bucks a week.
-He, he-- He can't pay 12,000.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.356
Do you know how much I take home?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.734
I'm afraid they got us
by the short ones there, Bob.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.902
We don't pay, they garnish your wages.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.113
What about garnishing your brain?

17:11.196 --> 17:13.615
-Hey, pal, we're not gonna pay your fee!
-Just give me my jacket!

17:13.699 --> 17:17.161
-Give me my jacket!
-Not one iota. Not one! No, sir!

17:17.953 --> 17:19.455
It's hard to get any straight answers,

17:19.538 --> 17:21.999
but as far as we can tell, the mother's
been gone for six months.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.168
We got a failure-to-appear
on the older sister.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.545
The middle sister ran away
a couple of weeks ago.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.840
Kid's been stealing food
just to put a meal on the table.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.551
Run the usual checks
on the younger sister.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.511
-Any warrants on the mother?
-No, sir.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.849
Issue one-- abandonment,
felony endangerment, being a wrong person.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.893
And get the Youth Authority
down here to pick up the boy.

17:40.976 --> 17:41.852
Yes, sir.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.562
Where's Jackie? I wanna see her.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.024
Uh, you'll see her as soon
as she gets done talking to her attorney.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.694
What about your other sister? Sonya?

17:50.778 --> 17:51.945
What about her?

17:52.029 --> 17:54.323
Well, we're trying to find her.
Don't you wanna help us out?

17:54.406 --> 17:56.158
I already told you what she looks like.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.910
Yeah, but don't you have
any idea where she might be?

17:58.994 --> 18:00.788
(sighs) We got a cousin in Rochester.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.122
Yeah?

18:03.165 --> 18:04.208
I don't know.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.460
Ms. Davenport!

18:10.005 --> 18:11.381
I think these papers belong to you.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.966
-Where is she?
-Guard level.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.384
I'll see her in a minute.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.389
Just want you to know I'm nominating
the Floyd Green bust

18:19.473 --> 18:20.766
for hummer of the week.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.310
Last time I looked,
grass was still illegal, Counselor.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.814
Frank, I'm familiar with Mr. Green's
past accomplishments,

18:26.897 --> 18:28.232
but a hummer's still a hummer.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.275
He'll be on the street in two hours.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.236
I'll start worrying about it in two hours.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.864
Hey, Leo! Leo.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.536
Voucher these plane tickets for me
as evidence, uh, in the Morris case,

18:41.161 --> 18:43.455
and I'll file a hardship return
on the rest of 'em.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.999
<i>Eau de P.U.</i>

18:46.542 --> 18:47.793
It's her favorite cologne.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.795
Whose, Leo? Myrna's?

18:50.838 --> 18:54.383
I thought, Belker's going to Vegas--
maybe he could deliver a letter to her.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.844
Double<i> Eau de P.U.</i>

18:59.012 --> 19:00.597
WACHTEL:
Ms. Davenport, my options are limited.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.851
She was busted for prostitution,
didn't show up for her preliminary.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.687
She's 16 years old and
without parental supervision.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.314
Your Honor, Ms. Dewitt informs me

19:09.398 --> 19:11.692
she's the sole support
for her brother and sister.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.068
Couldn't I just go home?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.945
I'm sorry, darling. That's not possible.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.323
Remand to Youth Authority until
the parent or parents are found.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.241
(gavel bangs)

19:19.533 --> 19:22.911
MAN: Docket is 639724-- Floyd Green.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.831
Possession of controlled substance,
to wit-- marijuana.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.334
WACHTEL: What have we here?

19:32.129 --> 19:33.380
One roach.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.257
(pen rolls on floor)

19:36.925 --> 19:38.719
Application, Ms. Davenport.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.096
A.C.D. or an outright, Your Honor.

19:41.471 --> 19:45.100
If you'll examine the papers,
this was a laughably illegal search.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.061
Do you have any reason
to toss this guy, detectives?

19:48.562 --> 19:50.522
-May we approach?
-Sure. Come on.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.032
(sighs)

20:01.783 --> 20:03.869
Judge, I came down here
because I want the courts

20:03.952 --> 20:05.996
to realize how serious
we are about this guy.

20:06.413 --> 20:09.333
Mm, said seriousness reflected
in your rousting him.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.126
He's threatened revenge on witnesses,

20:11.627 --> 20:14.087
he's shown no remorse ever
for two murders,

20:14.379 --> 20:16.381
and he's suspected
of at least one other murder

20:16.465 --> 20:17.466
while in Youth Authority.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.383
Unproven.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.345
-Likely, nevertheless.
-I am aware of Mr. Green's past.

20:21.428 --> 20:25.224
I cannot condone assaults
on the Constitution, Frank.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.767
A roach?

20:34.983 --> 20:36.193
Mr. Green.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.281
If legitimate concerns of the community
were my sole criterion,

20:41.365 --> 20:43.867
I'd hang you from
the courtroom chandelier.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.161
As it is, you've got rights.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.789
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-WACHTEL: You're welcome.

20:50.332 --> 20:54.586
Case dismissed on grounds
of unconstitutional search and seizure,

20:54.670 --> 20:56.129
and I'm ordering the police

20:56.213 --> 20:59.007
to remain at least 100 yards
from Floyd Green

20:59.091 --> 21:03.428
unless there is reasonable cause
to stop and question him!

21:07.599 --> 21:10.560
MAN: Next on the calendar,
docket number 49493--

21:10.644 --> 21:13.146
Louis Alvarado-- felonious assault.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.818
(indistinct)

21:17.901 --> 21:20.237
Uh, we had to keep
two tickets for evidence.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.906
Of course normal procedure would
have been to invoice 'em all,

21:22.990 --> 21:24.741
but Detective Washington here and me,

21:24.825 --> 21:26.743
we figured that might keep
you from your merchandise

21:26.827 --> 21:28.745
for a long time-- like maybe<i> years.</i>

21:28.829 --> 21:30.789
Hey, thanks a lot.
That could have cost me quite a bit.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.749
It wasn't easy getting these, either. Ooh.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.835
I took a bullet. It's a flesh wound.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.044
It's all in a day's work.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.172
Boy, people don't realize what
you fellas have to go through.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.758
Mr. Beckman... serve and protect.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.802
-That's our middle name.
-(siren wails)

21:44.261 --> 21:46.972
Listen, if you're contemplating
a trip anywhere,

21:47.306 --> 21:49.016
you got a friend at Beckman's Travel.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.768
Now that you bring it up,
let me ask you something--

21:52.227 --> 21:54.187
some of us were planning a trip.

21:54.771 --> 21:55.605
Where to?

21:56.606 --> 21:58.275
Palm Springs, California.

21:59.609 --> 22:03.572
A friend's funeral-- tragic.
Officer slain in the line of duty.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.782
Boy, that's right in the middle.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.411
I could take you into LAX,
or I could take you to, um...

22:09.494 --> 22:11.621
-LAX.
-L.A., uh, Las Vegas.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.875
Vegas? Uh... which is cheaper?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.877
-Vegas.
-Hey.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.213
There's a special excursion
I can let you have for $120 round-trip.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.506
That's my cost.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.259
Wait a minute.
When's your friend's funeral?

22:25.052 --> 22:28.430
Uh, day aft-- day after, uh, Thanksgiving.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.724
Ah, darn it.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.726
With these you have to be
back on Thanksgiving Day.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.561
Hey. We'll take six.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.606
The man is dead. He'll understand.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.108
Take a check?

22:41.401 --> 22:42.652
GARIBALDI: Yeah, give me the Lieutenant.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.030
-This is Detective Garibaldi.
-(clock chiming)

22:47.991 --> 22:49.034
Yeah, we lost him.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.662
I don't know where.
He went into a bar, and the next thing--

22:52.746 --> 22:54.414
he must have gone out a bathroom window.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.294
Aw, come on, Henry, give me a break.
You can't tail a guy from a hundred yards!

23:01.088 --> 23:02.047
Right, will do.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.633
Yeah, we're gonna check out his cousin's.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.551
Right.

23:09.721 --> 23:13.016
What good is having a credit union
if you can't get no credit?

23:13.225 --> 23:16.895
If I double-mortgage my car,
they'll<i> consider </i>$1,750.

23:16.978 --> 23:19.189
MAN (over radio):<i> 1-10-40, 1-10-40...</i>

23:19.272 --> 23:20.774
-That's real big of them.
-Damn.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.903
Hey, Renko, think maybe you could help me?

23:25.445 --> 23:27.322
(radio continues, indistinct)

23:27.406 --> 23:29.533
WOMAN (over radio):<i> 7l94, 7l94...</i>

23:29.616 --> 23:31.785
-Renko.
-I hear you, brother.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.454
Listen, Bobby Hill, there is no better
friend I have in the world.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.747
You have covered my behind

23:35.831 --> 23:37.207
-more times than I can count.
-Renko.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.793
-You have been there every single time--
-Renko, I don't need a testimonial.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.837
What I could use is
a couple thousand dollars.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.673
I got all these baby expenses, Bobby.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.551
WOMAN (over radio):<i> ...shop number 134...</i>

23:47.634 --> 23:49.094
Yeah, I figured as much.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.806
Really, uh, don't sweat it.

23:52.889 --> 23:55.934
You know, right now I feel lower
than a fallout shelter in a--

23:56.017 --> 23:57.769
WOMAN (over radio):
<i>All units vicinity 3900 block Jefferson.</i>

23:57.853 --> 23:58.687
Me too.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.189
WOMAN (over radio):<i> Shooting on a bus,</i>
<i>bus driver's down. Respond.</i>

24:01.273 --> 24:03.900
This is 2202 responding. Let's go for it.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.110
WOMAN:
<i>...Black male, medium height, weight...</i>

24:05.193 --> 24:07.571
(siren wails)

24:11.533 --> 24:13.660
(brakes screech)

24:13.743 --> 24:15.912
(siren stops)

24:15.996 --> 24:17.372
All right, out of the way! Police!

24:17.456 --> 24:18.457
(shouting)

24:18.540 --> 24:21.001
-That's the man!
-Did you get a description?

24:21.084 --> 24:23.837
-(indistinct)
-MAN: I saw him! I saw the man!

24:23.920 --> 24:25.255
HILL: All right! I'm gonna get your name!

24:25.338 --> 24:26.381
I think he's dead, Bobby!

24:27.048 --> 24:28.467
HILL: I'm gonna need your name!
Let him through!

24:28.550 --> 24:30.427
-Let the man through!
-Come on in here!

24:30.927 --> 24:32.596
-Was it Green?
-I don't know! We just got here!

24:32.679 --> 24:34.723
Floyd Green, he's got on a green jacket,
pink shirt.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.433
-He's a Black male.
-MAN: That's the one! That's the man!

24:36.516 --> 24:39.144
-Went up towards Porto Street.
-(indistinct)

24:39.227 --> 24:41.229
We got a rough match.
Floyd Green is the shooter.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.482
-HILL: Everybody get back!
-Last seen headed towards 140th.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.817
Oh, a hundred yards!
Man, a hundred damn yards!

24:45.901 --> 24:47.527
HILL: Get back, everybody! Get back!

24:55.410 --> 24:56.745
What did we get from the bus passengers?

24:56.828 --> 24:58.914
-Three people...
-Stakeout's in place, Frank.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.540
The arcade, the park,
and his cousin's bar.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.042
Call the Heights for anybody
they can spare.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.252
Everybody he knows, friends,
relatives, gang connections.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.670
-He's gotta come up for air.
-Right.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.130
-Ow! Ohh!
-That doesn't help us.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.090
Well, you just give us
the street coordinates,

25:09.174 --> 25:10.217
and we'll take care of the rest.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.218
-Hey, what is this?
-GARIBALDI: That moron.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.552
-GARIBALDI: A hundred yards?
-Oh.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.429
How else do you expect us
to stop this punk?

25:14.513 --> 25:17.641
Come on, Mr. Sanchez.
Leave the hardware behind-- all of youse.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.184
-Come on, let's go.
-(indistinct)

25:19.267 --> 25:20.810
-You could get hurt.
-Stupid!

25:20.894 --> 25:23.563
Hey, take it easy back there.
Now, let me explain this to you.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.774
This is what we want
and what we don't want.

25:26.066 --> 25:29.528
You are a source of information-- period.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.488
We don't want any heroes.

25:31.571 --> 25:34.032
The man is a stone-cold murderer,
Sergeant.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.910
Look, you do your job, you let us do ours.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.537
-I cook all kinds of things.
-Yeah?

25:38.620 --> 25:40.914
-What about Pratt?
-Eggs, soup, hamburgers...

25:40.997 --> 25:43.333
Steak and spaghetti. Real fine spaghetti.

25:43.416 --> 25:45.418
Yeah? How'd you get into
the whole cooking thing?

25:45.502 --> 25:48.213
-Somebody teach you how?
-No, I got a book on it.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.507
I don't make supper,
my sister wouldn't eat nothin'.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.092
Okay. Thank you very much.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.927
JABLONSKI: No one goes off half-cocked.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.846
Okay, uh, I'll be back in one second.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.139
No. No way.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.016
Do you want another sandwich?
You want anything?

26:00.100 --> 26:02.143
-BOY: No, ma'am.
-SANCHEZ: How are we supposed...

26:02.435 --> 26:04.980
Well, the Church Street Center's
filled for the next eight months,

26:05.063 --> 26:08.316
and, uh, Pratt Experimental School
isn't accepting any new kids.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.570
Foster care agency has spent
all its funding till the end of the year.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.113
What about the temp foster homes?

26:13.196 --> 26:14.447
Well, that's Youth Authority,

26:14.531 --> 26:16.658
and I have a call in to them,
but don't hold your breath.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.911
My experience is, it's pretty tough
to place a Black kid his age.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.455
-Yeah? Well, that stinks.
-You got that right.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.083
-(indistinct)
-5:30, right? Look, Harry.

26:25.166 --> 26:28.378
Harry, take your mind off your troubles.
I'm gonna say three little words, okay?

26:28.461 --> 26:31.089
-Las Vegas, round trip, tonight.
-Let me see.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.842
For you, special rate--
5:30, men's locker room.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.885
Men's locker room? Don't I get an invite?

26:36.553 --> 26:37.387
Harry?

26:38.179 --> 26:40.223
-Hey, Mick?
-Hi!

26:40.307 --> 26:42.726
Mick, I just got this message
you're going to Las Vegas tonight?

26:42.809 --> 26:43.643
Yep.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.771
Well, I gotta tell you,
I'm not that crazy about it.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.441
Well, neither am I,
but I gotta pick this prisoner up.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.067
You could have told me before this.

26:51.568 --> 26:52.402
Hey.

26:53.028 --> 26:56.114
Excuse us. It wasn't definite.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.283
Yeah, well, you could have
said it was a maybe.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.744
We've got a date with my sister
and her husband tonight.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.954
I paid 36 bucks for theater tickets.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.414
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back.

27:04.497 --> 27:05.874
Oh, it's not the point and you know it.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.792
What do you want from me?

27:07.876 --> 27:10.879
I want you to be more responsible
for the way you act towards me!

27:10.962 --> 27:12.339
Okay. I'm sorry.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.757
I should have told you sooner.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.426
It's not that big a deal,
so can we stop all this?

27:16.509 --> 27:17.844
'Cause you're embarrassing me.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.888
I'm the one being stood up,
and you're embarrassed?

27:19.971 --> 27:21.389
-That's great.
-Robin--

27:21.473 --> 27:24.017
If you think about it, maybe you could
give me a little advance notice

27:24.100 --> 27:25.894
if you're not gonna make
Thanksgiving dinner.

27:25.977 --> 27:26.811
Robin...

27:28.146 --> 27:32.609
Oh, Mick, I just wanted to ask you,
if you're near a roulette wheel,

27:32.984 --> 27:37.030
uh, put this on the black for me...
just in case.

27:37.113 --> 27:37.947
Yeah, okay.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.867
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

27:41.534 --> 27:42.827
Put it on the red.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.454
Yeah, okay.

27:45.580 --> 27:48.041
No, no. No, no, no. No, no.
Put it on the black--

27:48.375 --> 27:49.709
Uh, number 18.

27:49.918 --> 27:50.752
Okay.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.923
(sighs) Never mind!

27:55.006 --> 27:57.676
The judge's restrictions made
tailing him next to impossible.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.011
No, I think the detectives
did all they could, but how--

28:00.095 --> 28:02.347
How can you follow a guy
like this at 100 yards?

28:03.264 --> 28:05.475
Okay. Yeah, I'll tell him.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.268
One of us will call you back.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.648
Leo, Leo... cheap tickets for Vegas.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.651
-You can look up your old lady.
-Maybe.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.195
If you're serious,
you meet me 5:30, men's locker room.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.571
We'll talk logistics, huh?

28:19.197 --> 28:20.031
Leo.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.075
-What?
-Leo, what is this with you?

28:22.158 --> 28:25.161
First it's letters doused with cologne.
Now it's plane tickets.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.830
I got some personal days coming.

28:26.913 --> 28:27.872
You gotta be crazy

28:27.956 --> 28:30.166
if you think you're gonna get Myrna
to come back here, Leo.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.545
I didn't say I'm gonna bring her back!
Maybe I just want to see her.

28:33.628 --> 28:36.881
She doesn't want to see you.
Don't you understand that?

28:37.298 --> 28:39.384
Look, I'm talking to you
like a friend, Leo.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.011
You can't keep banging your head
against a wall.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.180
(sighs) You're right.

28:45.348 --> 28:46.433
Come on, Leo, wake up.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.184
Attaboy, Leo. That's right.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.229
BATES: Dollar sign or...

28:52.480 --> 28:55.108
It's the fabulous Fabe. Give me some.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.069
-Anything on Floyd Green?
-Not yet.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.447
Luce, I gotta talk to you a second.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.073
Work on that.

29:05.660 --> 29:08.621
Uh, maybe they got a match on
the description of the kid's other sister.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.915
It's hard to tell.
It's been down there eight days.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.500
-Down where?
-The city morgue.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.337
Uh, they got a girl in the drawer--
died of an O.D.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.633
I don't know if the kid's up to it,
but, uh, they'd like him to identify.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.929
Just tell him Frank Furillo
called back again.

29:25.138 --> 29:25.972
Yeah.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.682
Okay. Thanks.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.143
Wachtel's ducking us.

29:30.226 --> 29:33.438
I just got off with Briscoe.
Mayor's calling a press conference--

29:33.521 --> 29:34.981
Gonna lash into the judiciary.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.065
Anything on Green's cousin?

29:36.775 --> 29:37.609
Can't locate him.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.236
Excuse me, Captain.
I know your hands are full.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.322
-I'll keep you posted.
-Lieutenant.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.660
Um... I-I know you heard about the audit.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.329
Yeah, how'd it go?

29:49.412 --> 29:51.873
Well, it couldn't have really
gone much worse, actually.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.667
Captain, I was wondering--
I hate asking for this kind of favor,

29:54.751 --> 29:57.504
but could you just cosign a note for me
till I can get over the hump?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.548
Gee, I wish I could help you out, Bobby,
but Joyce and I are buying a house

30:00.632 --> 30:01.841
and we have to have our credit free.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.593
What about the credit union?

30:03.676 --> 30:06.346
Well, they'll give me another
$1,750 on my car,

30:06.429 --> 30:08.264
but, Captain, I need $12,000.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.059
I really wish there were more I could do.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.271
Okay, thanks anyway.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.440
Captain...

30:18.483 --> 30:20.652
This had absolutely
nothing to do with gambling.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.571
Glad to hear that.
Let me know what happens.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.699
Floyd Green, Captain--
he was in a shootout with Sanchez.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.867
How bad?

30:27.951 --> 30:30.495
Sanchez is critical.
They're rushing him to County.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.330
I'm sending all availables
on a perimeter search.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.748
Keep me posted.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.718
You know, you don't have to do this.
You can still say no.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.185
That's her.

30:55.019 --> 30:55.854
Are you sure?

30:56.229 --> 30:57.480
(crying) That's her. Close it.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.148
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.362
Fabian, will you wait?

31:04.445 --> 31:06.197
Fabian, hold it!

31:06.948 --> 31:08.157
I want to see Jackie.

31:08.658 --> 31:11.119
I'm sorry, you can't right now.
She's still in detention.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.955
-When will she be done over there?
-I don't know when she's gonna be done.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.040
It might be two hours,
and it might be a long time.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.794
Yeah, you got Jackie over there,
Sonya in there.

31:20.295 --> 31:23.423
Tell me something. Who I got now?

31:23.882 --> 31:27.260
Who I'm gonna cook for now? (crying)

31:27.343 --> 31:28.177
Fabian...

31:29.095 --> 31:30.054
(crying)

31:30.346 --> 31:31.180
No.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.479
(crying)

31:43.276 --> 31:44.110
Don't cry.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.034
How you doing?

31:53.119 --> 31:54.120
How am I doing?

31:57.665 --> 32:00.877
You know, you could always go out
on the street and get a loan shark.

32:01.794 --> 32:05.131
No, a loan shark's not the answer
to my problem, Renko. No, sir.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.717
Do you know that once a loan shark
get his hooks into you,

32:07.800 --> 32:08.760
you're his for life?

32:09.344 --> 32:11.095
I can't put myself in that position.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.015
WOMAN:<i> All units in pursuit</i>
<i>of Floyd Green vehicle,</i>

32:14.098 --> 32:15.475
<i>we have I.D. Respond.</i>

32:15.934 --> 32:18.019
-This is 2202 responding to.
-(siren wails)

32:18.102 --> 32:19.520
WOMAN:<i> I.D. Floyd Green vehicle,</i>

32:19.604 --> 32:21.940
<i>stolen, yellow Lincoln,</i>
<i>license plate D-1...</i>

32:22.023 --> 32:25.318
I hope he resists.
I really do hope he resists.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.654
(siren wails)

32:27.737 --> 32:30.198
WOMAN:<i> ND97, we're with you in pursuit.</i>

32:30.531 --> 32:32.492
RENKO: That's it. We got him. Punch it.

32:32.575 --> 32:36.704
(sirens wailing)

32:44.963 --> 32:46.965
RENKO: Stay on him, Bobby!
Stay with him! Stay with him!

32:48.007 --> 32:50.385
(sirens wailing)

32:52.929 --> 32:55.598
(horn honking)

33:02.438 --> 33:03.815
(tires screech)

33:03.898 --> 33:06.067
(wailing continues)

33:06.150 --> 33:07.527
(wailing stops)

33:12.407 --> 33:13.866
Get out of the car, Green!

33:13.950 --> 33:16.703
(trigger clicks)

33:31.009 --> 33:32.051
Get in there!

33:32.552 --> 33:34.137
(indistinct chatter)

33:34.220 --> 33:36.097
-Didn't take you long, Floyd.
-Easy, Henry.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.141
-You want some, too, man?
-Get him off!

33:38.224 --> 33:39.225
You piece of garbage!

33:41.102 --> 33:43.438
I already told you,
I gave him the transfer.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.482
Then he talkin' about
the transfer wasn't no good--

33:47.358 --> 33:48.651
Started giving me jive about it.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.446
I don't gotta take no crap--

33:52.405 --> 33:54.365
not from nobody-- not ever.

33:55.575 --> 33:56.993
Did the bus driver strike you?

33:57.076 --> 33:59.829
Did he make threatening remarks
or menace you in any way?

33:59.912 --> 34:01.205
Yeah, he told me to get off the bus.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.332
So you shot him?

34:04.459 --> 34:05.960
He was in my face.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.422
You'll be arraigned this afternoon, Floyd.

34:10.006 --> 34:12.425
I have to tell you,
you're facing up to 25 years in prison.

34:12.508 --> 34:14.761
No way. See, I'm Bernard.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.305
-Excuse me?
-Bernard Green.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.848
Floyd was my older brother.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.851
He was dead a year when they
busted me, so I said I was him.

34:22.477 --> 34:25.480
Now you check that out. I'm only 16.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.651
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Green,
but the law's been changed.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.489
Even 16-year-olds can be charged
as adults in a capital crime.

34:35.698 --> 34:36.532
You're jiving.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.034
Do I look like I am?

34:38.618 --> 34:41.329
You lying! You lying, you phony old bitch!

34:41.704 --> 34:43.498
-Guard!
-I'm gonna get you!

34:43.581 --> 34:46.667
-Sit down!
-I'm gonna get you! You believe it!

34:46.751 --> 34:48.711
-See you at arraignment.
-I'm gonna get you!

34:48.795 --> 34:50.296
Ain't nobody locking me away!

34:50.379 --> 34:51.798
I'm gonna get you! You believe me!

34:51.881 --> 34:53.800
-Trouble?
-Unhappy perpetrator.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.343
-FLOYD: (indistinct shouting)
-Floyd Green.

34:56.010 --> 34:59.180
D.A. offered a simple assault
on Muñoz and Escobedo.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.098
Did they do time?

35:00.681 --> 35:02.475
-Year's probation.
-Let's take it.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.937
What? Green attack you in there?

35:06.020 --> 35:08.356
-That means you, lady!
-If he had his druthers.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.526
It's the Christians
and the lions in those rooms.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.529
I gotta tell you something.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.907
When it gets down to dog-eat-dog,

35:18.533 --> 35:21.119
John Pescator is no Christian.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.752
-Sergeant Bates...
-Yes?

35:30.294 --> 35:33.840
Ruth Morgenstern, county Youth Authority.
I'm here to pick up, uh...

35:33.923 --> 35:35.216
Dewitt, Fabian.

35:36.092 --> 35:36.926
Right.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.428
Uh, I need a minute of your time.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.598
(indistinct chatter)

35:50.815 --> 35:52.692
I'd like to have him come live with me.
Is that possible?

35:55.319 --> 35:57.113
Have you, uh,
talked to your husband about this?

35:57.488 --> 36:00.032
I'm single. I have a decent-paying job.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.784
I have money in the bank.
I have an extra room.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.412
I'd make sure that
he was enrolled in school.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.205
I'm pretty sure I could handle it.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.040
Sergeant, this is not a sweater

36:08.124 --> 36:09.876
that you can take back to the store
if it doesn't fit,

36:09.959 --> 36:12.003
or some abandoned kitty cat
that might have sedu--

36:12.086 --> 36:15.298
Don't patronize me, I am not a wide-eyed
little girl trying to play mommy.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.674
Neither am I.

36:16.757 --> 36:17.967
But I've seen too many
of these troubled kids

36:18.050 --> 36:19.552
shuttled back and forth
like cattle from one--

36:19.635 --> 36:21.012
This kid is different.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.932
According to my reports,
he's been surviving for months on his own.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.018
What makes you think he would
suddenly take to your parenting?

36:27.643 --> 36:29.645
And what makes you think
he would take to juvenile hall?

36:30.938 --> 36:32.523
At least I'm willing to try.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.109
Are you sure you know what
you'll be getting into?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.737
No, not completely.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.073
I've been a cop for nine years.
I've been five years up here on the Hill.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.783
I've seen kids beat up,
I've seen 'em tortured,

36:42.867 --> 36:45.161
I've seen the pimps send 'em out
on the street before puberty.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.163
Come on, Mrs. Morgenstern.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.081
What do you say?

36:51.334 --> 36:53.419
Why don't we see what Fabian Dewitt says?

37:01.844 --> 37:04.222
So... here's the thing.

37:04.931 --> 37:08.392
Like I said, we can't let you go home
as long as your mom's not there,

37:08.851 --> 37:11.938
and the only space that the city has
for you right now is at juvenile hall,

37:12.021 --> 37:13.022
which is not a great place to be.

37:13.773 --> 37:17.526
So I'm thinking,
uh, if we can get the Youth Authority lady

37:17.610 --> 37:21.447
to give us an okay,
how would you like to stay with me?

37:22.865 --> 37:25.117
You mean, like,
you'd be my mom or something?

37:26.661 --> 37:27.703
Like your foster mom.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.373
What happens when my own mom comes home?

37:30.748 --> 37:33.376
That'll be great.
At that time, the court will probably try

37:33.459 --> 37:35.378
to get the whole family
back together again.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.589
But in the meantime, you'll have
what they call a stable environment.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.968
I like you, miss, and I appreciate you
putting yourself out to me.

37:42.551 --> 37:46.305
But I got responsibilities.
I gotta take care of my sister.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.766
Fabian, if you have
to go to juvenile hall,

37:48.849 --> 37:50.559
you're not gonna be able
to take care of anybody.

37:50.977 --> 37:54.689
And anyway, your sister has some
serious problems of her own right now.

37:55.356 --> 37:58.609
No matter how much you love her, the court
is not gonna let you two live together.

37:58.693 --> 38:02.196
Fabian, give it a try. One night.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.323
I don't wanna disappoint no one.

38:04.699 --> 38:05.825
Understand what I'm saying?

38:06.701 --> 38:08.995
-You couldn't disappoint me.
-Yes, I could.

38:09.537 --> 38:13.541
I be so used to taking care of my sisters,
I already know how to do that.

38:13.874 --> 38:17.753
But if I let you start taking care of me,
I have to start doing things your way.

38:18.254 --> 38:21.674
Like school and stuff.
And I don't know, miss.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.884
I can see that not working out at all.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.512
Damn it, Fabian.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.889
You know what it's like in juvie hall?

38:28.973 --> 38:30.558
See? You're mad at me already.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.896
I'm sorry. I gotta say no.

38:37.606 --> 38:39.317
J.D.: All right, listen up.
Now, these are junket tickets,

38:39.400 --> 38:41.527
which means they got
a couple of restrictions on 'em.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.571
-A: we gotta take the night flight out.
-Hey, guys.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.990
That's 9:30 tonight--
which is a direct flight.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.825
-Is that direct or nonstop?
-It's direct.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.452
Which means there's no change of planes.

38:49.535 --> 38:52.496
Now, in terms of stops,
I think maybe there's a couple.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.165
-Maybe four.
-Four? Four stops?

38:54.248 --> 38:56.125
Hey, it's a junket, you know?
It's a trade-off--

38:56.208 --> 38:58.044
Price for a little convenience.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.963
B: these tickets expire midnight
day after tomorrow.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.006
-Thanksgiving.
-Right.

39:02.089 --> 39:05.092
Which, there's a return flight from Vegas
11 o'clock Thanksgiving morning.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.011
The schedule sounds
a little cramped, John.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.430
I look at this as damage
insurance, Lieutenant.

39:09.513 --> 39:12.183
I mean, how much trouble
can you get into in 36 hours?

39:13.184 --> 39:15.519
Well, I for one have
a few personal days coming.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.438
Yeah, I do feel
a little sniffle comin' on.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.148
I could be good and sick by tomorrow.

39:19.231 --> 39:20.066
Hey, guys, no sale?

39:20.441 --> 39:23.027
Well, J.D.,
I don't think that Daryl Ann would like it

39:23.110 --> 39:24.195
if I missed Thanksgiving Day.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.654
Hey, but we do appreciate it, though.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.657
Hey, hey, at 160 bucks a ticket
round-trip to Vegas,

39:28.741 --> 39:29.909
I thought I had to let you know.

39:29.992 --> 39:30.951
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, hey, hey.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.079
Take a look at this, J.D.
You made a mistake.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.832
You read it wrong, babe. Tickets are $120.

39:36.916 --> 39:37.917
Let me see that.

39:39.794 --> 39:40.628
Wait a second.

39:41.670 --> 39:43.130
(laughs) It's only $120.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.925
Yeah, you were looking
at the flight number.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.844
Right, only $120. That's better yet.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.100
-I'm in, J.D.
-Right.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.726
I am giddy with excitement.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.273
-(chuckles)
-J.D.: All right!

40:05.236 --> 40:07.154
MAN: J2J76, Your Honor--

40:07.238 --> 40:10.324
Luis Escobedo and Martin Muñoz,
aggravated assault.

40:10.741 --> 40:11.575
Mr. Bernstein?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.078
Uh, we'd accept simple assault,
Your Honor.

40:14.161 --> 40:16.580
-Recommend a year's probation.
-Counsel?

40:16.664 --> 40:18.082
-Acceptable, Your Honor.
-Acceptable.

40:18.165 --> 40:22.294
Messieurs Muñoz and Escobedo
will be assigned case officers.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.422
(bangs gavel)
A year's probation, gentlemen.

40:24.505 --> 40:27.508
Uh, Escobedo also has failure-
to-appear warrants, Your Honor.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.010
Driving while suspended,
driving while impaired.

40:31.220 --> 40:33.889
Saucehead, huh? Mr. Bernstein?

40:34.849 --> 40:36.851
Uh, $2,000 bond, Your Honor.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.062
Ah, let's make it $5,000.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.023
-We like people who are accused...
-Shh!

40:43.107 --> 40:45.276
...to show up for their trials,
Mr. Escobedo.

40:45.359 --> 40:46.235
We're funny that way.

40:46.861 --> 40:47.695
Next.

40:47.778 --> 40:51.157
MAN: Docket 4487D, Your Honor--
Floyd or Bernard Green.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.201
Assault, attempted murder,
murder in second degree.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.788
Complaining officers Patricia Mayo
and Harold Garibaldi.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.332
-MAN: Can you make the bond?
-Hey, Fish, you stink.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.085
-ESCOBEDO: You know? You the worst.
-Shut up over there!

41:03.711 --> 41:04.545
WACHTEL: Mr. Green.

41:04.628 --> 41:05.880
-Is he gonna make his bond?
-Einstein?

41:05.963 --> 41:08.215
WACHTEL: You made me look
pretty stupid, didn't you?

41:08.966 --> 41:10.384
Are you evil, Mr. Green?

41:11.260 --> 41:13.262
Or are you just a piece of pathology?

41:13.345 --> 41:16.265
You want some, too, man?

41:16.348 --> 41:18.851
-He's got a gun!
-(shouting)

41:18.934 --> 41:21.228
-I ain't going to jail!
-What?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.147
-I ain't going to jail!
-Don't be stupid, huh?

41:23.230 --> 41:25.441
-Don't be stupid!
-Oh, you is stupid!

41:25.524 --> 41:27.818
You're a jerk! I got a jerk for a lawyer.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.279
-Don't be stupid, Escobedo!
-You is stupid!

41:30.362 --> 41:33.782
-Don't you point at me!
-(gunshots)

41:34.909 --> 41:36.911
(gunshots)

41:36.994 --> 41:37.828
Oh!

41:37.912 --> 41:39.914
(glass shatters)

41:41.749 --> 41:43.542
-(Escobedo groaning)
-You all right?

41:46.253 --> 41:49.215
-I was struck by fragments.
-(groaning)

41:49.298 --> 41:51.884
-(groaning continues)
-I was struck by fragments.

41:55.721 --> 41:56.555
Fragments.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.935
-I think he's dead.
-(Escobedo groaning)

42:04.230 --> 42:09.818
The second that the, uh,
IRS guy said... what I owe,

42:09.902 --> 42:14.698
I felt this kind of panic,
like I'm gonna have to get this over with.

42:14.782 --> 42:18.619
I, um, I gotta get it behind me right now.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.039
That time has got a lot of
bad memories attached to it.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.582
I was feeling like...

42:24.917 --> 42:30.005
I'll be paying on this thing every week,
I-I'd be thinking about losing that money.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.007
(soft piano)

42:32.091 --> 42:34.426
But when I kept coming up short,

42:34.510 --> 42:38.472
and when I couldn't get
the-- the money I needed, I--

42:41.850 --> 42:45.104
You know, Lynn, when I was
driving by to pick you up,

42:45.813 --> 42:48.774
I said to myself, "Hey, you're just gonna
have to get used to it.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.859
You're gonna have to deal with it."

42:51.902 --> 42:57.866
(sighs) I don't know ex-- exactly why,
but I do know that going from day to day

42:57.950 --> 42:59.535
doesn't scare me like it used to.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.623
I've been trying to find a way
to say this all through dinner.

43:05.165 --> 43:06.166
What's that?

43:06.709 --> 43:09.253
Television newscasters
make a good living, Bobby.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.921
I could loan you that money.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.008
Ain't you something?

43:14.800 --> 43:16.594
You can repay me just like a bank.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.179
(laughs)

43:19.263 --> 43:21.348
I'd never have a sexier loan officer.

43:24.685 --> 43:28.105
But, uh... I think I'm gonna
do it the other way, you know,

43:28.188 --> 43:30.399
just pay on it week by week.

43:31.317 --> 43:32.151
You sure?

43:33.777 --> 43:34.945
Yeah, I'm sure.

43:35.738 --> 43:36.905
But I do appreciate the offer.

43:38.782 --> 43:41.076
I hope this isn't gonna
mess anything up with us.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.537
No, it's not gonna mess up anything.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.498
-Hi. Do you ever gamble?
-Hi, how are you?

43:46.582 --> 43:48.334
-John, come on.
-How'd you like to take a chance with me?

43:48.417 --> 43:49.960
-NEAL: Come on, J.D., move it on.
-Right on that side.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.003
-NEAL: Hi.
-WOMAN: Hi, how you doing?

43:51.086 --> 43:52.463
-Right next to him.
-NEAL: Oh, thank you.

43:52.546 --> 43:53.422
Hey, Mick.

43:53.505 --> 43:55.382
-Just leave me alone, J.D.
-Come on, Belker.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.009
What do you want us to do,
lay down and die here?

43:57.092 --> 43:58.677
I want certain things understood.

43:58.761 --> 43:59.970
Hey, we know you're working, Mick.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.931
That's exactly correct.
I'm picking up a prisoner, period.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.059
Hey, would you do me a favor
and just lighten up?

44:05.684 --> 44:08.312
Sir, this'll have to go under your seat
or in an overhead compartment.

44:08.395 --> 44:10.147
No, it's a little crowded up there, miss.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.690
-Hi, Mick. How are you?
-Let me take this.

44:11.774 --> 44:14.234
-What is this? What is this?
-Hey, hey.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.486
What is this?

44:15.569 --> 44:17.780
Would you put that back?
It's Leo's letter to his ex.

44:17.863 --> 44:19.406
-Oof.
-Would you give me that?

44:19.490 --> 44:20.324
Wait a minute!

44:21.033 --> 44:24.370
Well, what's this? Leo's wife's enema bag?

44:24.453 --> 44:25.954
-That's a motorman's helper.
-A what?

44:26.038 --> 44:27.498
A motorman's helper, for when nature calls

44:27.581 --> 44:30.167
and circumstances prevent
our answering it in a lavatory.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.461
It's if I have to go
when I have my prisoner--

44:32.544 --> 44:35.214
Now, could-- would you
give it back to me, please?

44:35.297 --> 44:37.216
Very prudent, Mick. Very farsighted.

44:37.299 --> 44:38.550
-RAY: Thank you.
-WOMAN: I'll take those.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.468
-There's no more room.
-Oh, thank you, thank you.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.929
-Hey, hi, you guys!
-J.D.: Hey, Lieutenant!

44:42.012 --> 44:43.681
All right! What'd you do, go retail?

44:43.764 --> 44:44.890
No, no, no, no.

44:44.973 --> 44:48.143
When the travel agent came
for the new tickets, I bought one.

44:48.477 --> 44:49.812
All right. Good for you.

44:49.895 --> 44:53.399
Oh, I'm so nervous,
I think I'm going to vomit.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.359
(sighs)

44:55.442 --> 44:58.654
I told Rosa I was going to Austin
to visit my sick uncle.

44:58.737 --> 45:02.950
Hey, we're gonna crush 'em, Lieutenant.
We are gonna break the bank over there.

45:03.033 --> 45:05.536
-Do you really think so, J.D.?
-Seat belt fastened, sir.

45:05.619 --> 45:08.330
Yes, yes, I will.
We're gonna break the bank.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.581
Oh, good for you.

45:09.665 --> 45:10.499
Thank you.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.876
Here. Gum, Mick?

45:13.293 --> 45:15.129
It relieves the middle ear
when we're pressurized.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.339
What do you mean, "pressurized"?

45:17.673 --> 45:18.841
Ah, come on. Take it easy, Mick.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.592
There's hardly any chance we'll crash.

45:20.968 --> 45:21.927
Mick, Mick...

45:22.594 --> 45:24.430
(makes droning sound)

45:24.513 --> 45:26.473
(laughs)

45:26.557 --> 45:29.685
(thunder rumbles)

45:37.776 --> 45:39.445
(door opens)

45:47.703 --> 45:49.246
-Hi.
-Hi.

45:49.872 --> 45:50.956
Nice shiner.

45:51.039 --> 45:54.251
Older dude went for my seconds.
Had to set him down.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.837
How's the food?

45:57.045 --> 45:58.547
Their cooking ain't in my league.

45:58.922 --> 45:59.840
I bet.

46:01.675 --> 46:03.761
I just came by to see
how you were making out.

46:04.011 --> 46:04.845
Is that all?

46:06.597 --> 46:07.431
No.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.727
Fabian, truth is, uh,

46:12.102 --> 46:14.188
I did something
I think you're not gonna like.

46:16.231 --> 46:17.065
What?

46:18.192 --> 46:20.110
I got this judge to sign some papers

46:20.194 --> 46:22.821
that make me your legal guardian
until he says differently.

46:23.322 --> 46:24.323
What if I don't go?

46:25.282 --> 46:26.909
Well, I'm not gonna try to force you.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.620
But I wanted you to know
that I care about you enough

46:29.703 --> 46:32.164
to do more than just talk about it.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.416
I can't be your mama.

46:35.167 --> 46:39.463
I mean, if people take one look at us,
it's pretty obvious I'm not your mom.

46:40.756 --> 46:45.636
But I want to be your friend,
and I want to help you to be somebody.

46:46.261 --> 46:48.639
If you don't come home
with me today, it's okay.

46:48.722 --> 46:51.141
I'll just come back
tomorrow and ask again,

46:51.225 --> 46:52.768
and the next day and the day after that.

46:53.435 --> 46:55.896
And eventually I figure that
you'll have to give me a try

46:55.979 --> 46:57.773
just to get me off your back.

46:58.899 --> 47:00.776
I come home with you tonight,
and then what?

47:01.109 --> 47:02.319
What if it don't work out?

47:04.071 --> 47:04.905
I don't know.

47:07.616 --> 47:08.534
Take a chance.

47:10.494 --> 47:11.328
Okay.

47:13.497 --> 47:14.331
Now what?

47:16.083 --> 47:18.710
You ever into hugs and stuff like that?

47:20.003 --> 47:21.380
Not too much.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.424
Okay. No problem.

47:25.467 --> 47:26.760
Uh... are you ready?

47:27.219 --> 47:28.053
I guess.

47:28.929 --> 47:29.763
Okay.

47:40.107 --> 47:40.941
Let's do it.

48:00.919 --> 48:03.964
(closing theme playing)
