00:24.816 --> 00:28.862
<i>Please take your seats.
Our show is about to begin.</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:33.616
Extra butter, please.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.702
Keep going.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.495
Okay, great.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.872
Nope, not great.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.582
More.

00:40.582 --> 00:44.461
Now stop. Okay.
Now double that, and we're done.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.558
Come on!

00:58.558 --> 01:01.519
Evil Ex Number Three, Todd Ingram, right?

01:01.519 --> 01:04.272
The vegan? Let's fight!

01:06.816 --> 01:09.486
Me? Fight you? Over Ramona?

01:09.486 --> 01:11.279
Don't make me laugh!

01:12.030 --> 01:13.531
And I'm vegan no longer.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.576
I had a cheese plate for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner today.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.914
You owe me a new tub of butter.
I mean, popcorn.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.626
And you didn't create this weird
force field between me and Ramona?

01:24.626 --> 01:27.921
Dude, for your information,
I've got a new obsessive love interest.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.591
Hey! You were Wallace's roommate!
Tell me everything!

01:31.591 --> 01:33.593
Where was he born?
What is his middle name?

01:33.593 --> 01:35.845
Does he have a favorite vegetable?

01:35.845 --> 01:39.307
Move on, Todd.
I'm not interested in curds and whey.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.186
There were sparks! Sparks!

01:44.813 --> 01:46.147
There's no such thing.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.989
<i>I had that dream again</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:56.616
Hi, Ramona.

01:58.910 --> 02:02.247
Scott Pilgrim!
Do not be throwing hands at me right now!

02:02.247 --> 02:04.207
This is the biggest night of my career.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.544
I shouldn't even be
wasting my voice on you! So, bzzp!

02:11.131 --> 02:12.215
Well, look at this.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.051
Scott and Ramona together again.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.803
So he's alive!

02:16.803 --> 02:18.096
Put 'er there, Pilgrim.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.475
Hey, I get it. No presh on the handshake.

02:22.475 --> 02:26.437
You didn't create a force field preventing
me and Ramona from kissing, did you?

02:26.437 --> 02:30.024
Scotty, that evil villain stuff
is behind me. I've got Jules now.

02:30.024 --> 02:33.778
We're just here to watch the show,
you psycho maniac. Let us pass.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.696
What?

02:46.416 --> 02:49.169
Come on, fellas. Don't make this about me.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.172
Let me tell you
about Broadway Bad Boy, Matthew Patel.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.216
Hi-yah!

03:01.806 --> 03:03.391
Hey, Evil Exes!

03:03.391 --> 03:06.019
Do either of you know anything
about this force field thingy?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.188
And would either of you
like to fight about it?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.105
Nope.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.692
Come on. Let's go watch
a stupid musical about a stupid guy.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.697
Scott Pilgrim.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.576
Excuse us. We were just reading aloud.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.454
<i>"Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Musical."</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:25.663
We're not here to fight.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.541
Our robot says
we're all bros in the future. So...

03:28.541 --> 03:29.459
Later, bro.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.754
So it probably wasn't them then.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.297
That leaves...

03:34.297 --> 03:35.965
Wait, nobody?

03:35.965 --> 03:37.926
We've ruled out all my exes.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.429
What the hell? No fights? No kissing?

03:41.429 --> 03:43.431
This finale sucks.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.920
I'm so excited
I might legitimately pass out again!

05:37.920 --> 05:41.466
I'm here to support the two of you,
but this better be really good.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.719
"Based on a memoir by Old Young Neil."

05:45.511 --> 05:47.180
I wonder if there's any relation?

05:49.223 --> 05:50.767
Scott Pilgrim!

05:51.392 --> 05:52.769
So you got the girl.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.604
You gonna kiss her or what?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.439
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

06:16.542 --> 06:19.295
- <i>I'm Scott Pilgrim</i>
- <i>I know, shut up</i>

06:19.295 --> 06:20.797
<i>I had that dream again</i>

06:20.797 --> 06:23.424
<i>I didn't care the first time you told me,
I care even less now</i>

06:23.424 --> 06:27.678
<i>The girl with rollerblades
And rainbow hair</i>

06:28.346 --> 06:32.433
<i>How do I tell him</i>

06:32.433 --> 06:37.397
<i>My exes are evil?</i>

06:37.397 --> 06:38.439
<i>- Skater
- Exes</i>

06:38.439 --> 06:39.357
<i>- Actor
- Evil</i>

06:39.357 --> 06:40.274
<i>- Vegan
- Exes</i>

06:40.274 --> 06:41.192
<i>- Rock star
- Evil</i>

06:41.192 --> 06:42.777
<i>- Mogul, Titan
- Exes, Evil</i>

06:42.777 --> 06:43.694
<i>- Lover
- Exes</i>

06:43.694 --> 06:48.032
<i>- Fighter
- We are the Evil Exes!</i>

06:48.574 --> 06:49.867
<i>Bread ain't all that</i>

06:51.911 --> 06:53.246
<i>Bread makes you fat</i>

06:55.081 --> 06:56.916
<i>What's wrong with that?</i>

06:56.916 --> 06:59.669
<i>Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott!</i>

07:00.920 --> 07:04.340
<i>This is your precious life!</i>

07:23.943 --> 07:25.111
What the hell?

07:25.111 --> 07:26.320
Where are we?

07:28.489 --> 07:31.284
Gotta be part of the show.
The special effects are incredible.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.494
It most certainly is not!

07:33.494 --> 07:36.372
I need to get back
and sing the big finale!

07:37.373 --> 07:38.666
Exactly.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.418
He needs to bring the house down.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.628
With dynamite!

07:42.628 --> 07:44.505
Julie and I rigged
the whole stage with it.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.507
You did what? Why?

07:46.507 --> 07:48.342
Isn't it obvious?

07:48.342 --> 07:49.635
You took his life away.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.096
And I'm the cool girl
who's helping him get it back.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.599
But that could really hurt someone!

07:54.599 --> 07:55.558
Not us.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.768
The cast and crew, maybe.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.353
Still not cool, Goose.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.063
Enough!

08:06.444 --> 08:07.570
Scott?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.280
But old.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.656
No.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.992
Even older.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.499
Even Older Me!

08:19.499 --> 08:22.210
How ya doing? Love the white hair.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.512
I explicitly told you
to stay away from Ramona!

08:32.512 --> 08:33.888
But did you listen?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.516
No!

08:48.110 --> 08:50.071
Isn't that perfect?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.280
Scott and Ramona.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.574
Must be love.

08:54.158 --> 08:57.954
Hey, give us a kiss, you two.
Let's see those sparks!

08:59.413 --> 09:02.291
The force field! It was you!

09:02.291 --> 09:03.459
Duh!

09:03.459 --> 09:06.087
I tried to convince you
to give up on Ramona,

09:06.087 --> 09:09.507
but if you didn't listen,
I had a backup plan.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.801
<i>I put nanomachines in your drink.</i>

09:11.801 --> 09:15.680
<i>Developed by the Twins.
Coded to Ramona's DNA.</i>

09:16.556 --> 09:21.352
You'll find the AK fields they generate
to be quite impenetrable.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.145
"AK fields"?

09:23.145 --> 09:25.231
Anti-Kiss fields!

09:27.567 --> 09:31.070
So why are you here fighting us?
You've already won.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.991
I'm here
because winning didn't change anything!

09:35.491 --> 09:39.245
We still end up
marrying Ramona inexplicably!

09:40.246 --> 09:43.958
You and all your stupid friends
must team up at some point in my new past

09:43.958 --> 09:47.295
and figure out
how to dissolve the Anti-Kiss Fields.

09:47.295 --> 09:51.048
My new memories are kind of fuzzy,
but that made me realize

09:51.549 --> 09:54.260
all my plans were too complicated.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.763
It's time to do what
I should have done in the first place.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.682
- Rip your--
- Ahem!

10:00.474 --> 10:04.103
Sir, I respect the work
you've put into this villain plot,

10:04.103 --> 10:06.772
but I have my own villain plot going on.

10:07.481 --> 10:11.527
So please, send the rest of us back first.
We've got no beef with you.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.905
What if I have a beef with you?

10:22.163 --> 10:22.997
Gordon!

10:22.997 --> 10:24.874
Put him down, you old f***!

10:28.628 --> 10:29.795
Pathetic.

10:31.922 --> 10:36.010
After you left the future,
and after Old Wallace kicked me out,

10:36.677 --> 10:38.554
<i>I began my training.</i>

10:48.022 --> 10:52.777
<i>For ten years, I did nothing
but study all of your skills.</i>

10:52.777 --> 10:55.363
<i>Your strengths, your weaknesses.</i>

10:55.363 --> 10:58.324
<i>Because there's only one way to end this.</i>

11:00.618 --> 11:04.038
Me versus the world!

11:04.038 --> 11:08.042
I have to destroy all of you!

11:08.959 --> 11:11.170
So you're the big bad.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.254
Me?

11:12.254 --> 11:16.175
I'm a good guy!
I've been living like a friggin' monk!

11:16.676 --> 11:17.968
Is that what we're calling it?

11:17.968 --> 11:20.262
Or is it just that you haven't
been outside in ten years?

11:21.347 --> 11:23.099
You sound just like my wife!

11:26.936 --> 11:30.147
<i>Even Older Scott Pilgrim versus everyone!</i>

11:31.190 --> 11:32.066
<i>Fight!</i>

11:44.870 --> 11:45.705
Ramona!

12:07.601 --> 12:10.438
Ramona, are you okay?

12:10.438 --> 12:12.565
Got anything besides that hammer?

12:29.915 --> 12:32.084
It's time to Chau-down!

12:32.084 --> 12:34.545
You want to fight Old Scotty P?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.130
Slice!

12:44.764 --> 12:46.932
You need to respect your elders!

12:46.932 --> 12:48.642
All's fair in love and--

12:48.642 --> 12:49.894
War!

12:51.353 --> 12:52.188
Om.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.824
Rocket punch!

14:02.883 --> 14:04.051
Gordon!

14:09.098 --> 14:10.641
Ramona!

14:26.574 --> 14:27.408
Scott!

14:28.284 --> 14:30.452
Ramona, let's hit him together!

14:30.452 --> 14:31.370
Wait.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.105
You need to let me live my life!

14:58.105 --> 15:01.358
If I do, you'll end up where I ended up.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.276
Alone.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.863
Alone in a room for ten years!

15:05.863 --> 15:09.199
That was your choice! Let me make my own!

15:09.199 --> 15:11.201
I'm you!

15:15.372 --> 15:16.373
Scott!

15:21.128 --> 15:23.339
What if he's right?

15:25.090 --> 15:26.425
He's you.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.636
Do I want to date that guy?

15:29.178 --> 15:31.347
You think I want to become that guy?

15:32.014 --> 15:32.932
I won't!

15:34.642 --> 15:37.770
Scott, how can you be sure?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.005
Ten years!

16:05.673 --> 16:06.924
Ten years!

16:06.924 --> 16:08.175
Not even a text?

16:08.175 --> 16:12.346
Then Wallace tells me you're training
to go back in time and fight yourself?

16:13.138 --> 16:17.685
Well, not just myself.
A lot of people and a robot.

16:17.685 --> 16:22.189
We hit one rough patch,
and you go completely insane?

16:22.189 --> 16:24.692
Why are you in the past
fighting all of these people...

16:24.692 --> 16:25.818
And a robot.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.404
...when you could've been fighting for us?

16:29.279 --> 16:30.864
We were over?

16:30.864 --> 16:33.117
I just needed some space, dude.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.911
Well, what have I been doing
for the past ten years?

16:35.911 --> 16:37.454
Giving you space!

16:37.454 --> 16:41.417
Okay, wait. Back up.
Are you saying that we weren't over?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.877
Are you saying that you still loved me?

16:43.877 --> 16:46.588
At the time, yes.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.633
Does that mean
that we can get back together?

16:50.759 --> 16:53.595
Just like that, after ten years?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.431
No, dude.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.727
Well, that makes sense, I guess.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.895
So what about me?

17:02.438 --> 17:05.274
You're telling me I should just skate on?

17:05.774 --> 17:07.693
Call it another failed experiment?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.362
Would that come as any surprise?

17:11.613 --> 17:17.494
Go ahead, both of you, run!
Run away from the thing that you love.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.557
I'm done running.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.145
You. I choose you.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.078
Super Ramona!

17:59.078 --> 18:00.496
It's just like...

18:00.496 --> 18:03.373
<i>- Sonic the Hedgehog 3!
- Sonic 2!</i> I mean, <i>3!</i>

18:04.416 --> 18:07.461
Wow! This one's just an idiot kid.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.130
And this one is a real mess.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.884
- Kick his ass, Super Ramona!
- No.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.386
It's never too late to clean up a mess.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.933
But I will send him home
so he can get started.

18:20.933 --> 18:25.354
Wait, me? Who? No! Wait, I'm--

18:28.398 --> 18:29.900
Well, this is great.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.984
Not!

18:32.194 --> 18:35.489
<i>The me who left him
and the me who just met him...</i>

18:35.489 --> 18:36.782
<i>We’re the same.</i>

18:38.117 --> 18:40.828
I see that now. It’s all the same.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.496
It’s all beautiful.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.124
Beautiful.

18:57.594 --> 18:58.470
Wow!

18:58.971 --> 19:03.976
Hey. Because I’ll have a lot of trouble
saying it later, let me say it now.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.686
I love you, Scott.

19:05.686 --> 19:08.230
And I run away from the thing that I love.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.775
But what I’ve done in the past
doesn’t have to define me.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.612
Help me keep remembering that, okay?

19:23.871 --> 19:25.455
Thank you!

19:28.375 --> 19:30.294
Killer work! You crushed that!

19:30.294 --> 19:32.296
- Yeah!
- The Bad Boy of Broadway.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.881
- Tremendous.
- Spectacular.

19:33.881 --> 19:34.798
Not bad.

19:50.898 --> 19:51.857
Sparks.

19:57.905 --> 19:58.739
Handled!

20:05.162 --> 20:07.789
They tried to bomb the theater, sir.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.375
We don't use the b-word
on opening night, girls.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.211
Why'd you do it, Gordon?

20:13.879 --> 20:14.796
I don't know.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.840
Maybe I am just evil.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.760
I only wanted revenge
for what you took from me.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.431
Buddy, you think I enjoy being a CEO?

20:24.431 --> 20:26.016
I've lost billions!

20:26.016 --> 20:29.228
Is there any way
you would take the empire back?

20:29.728 --> 20:32.147
Just let me keep my show,
and the rest of it is yours.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.998
Woo-hoo!

20:49.998 --> 20:53.126
- You were the best Scott of them all.
- I like Matthew now.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.045
Yeah, it sucked.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.550
Yeah, all right!
What do we... Okay! Is it over?

21:05.639 --> 21:09.017
We are Sex Bob-Omb! One! Two! Three! Four!

21:09.017 --> 21:11.770
<i>Hey, hey</i>

21:14.648 --> 21:19.194

21:19.736 --> 21:24.157

21:32.874 --> 21:34.126
<i>I feel fine</i>

21:35.419 --> 21:37.045
<i>Hey, hey</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:40.007
<i>- I feel fine</i>
- <i>I don't feel good</i>

21:46.471 --> 21:48.390
Wow! It's sounding great.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.225
See? We don't suck.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.352
Not since Knives joined the band.

21:52.352 --> 21:56.523
All right, fine. We don't suck.
But we are late. Come on, Knives!

21:58.275 --> 21:59.234
Yay!

22:23.091 --> 22:24.509
That's lunch, people!

22:30.474 --> 22:32.601
All right, slow down!

22:32.601 --> 22:35.354
We're making an action movie,
not living one.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.856
Have you seen him <i>Tokyo Drift</i> that thing?

22:37.856 --> 22:40.442
Young Neil is off the chain!

22:40.442 --> 22:42.527
I'm a speed demon.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.239
Vegan power!

23:16.812 --> 23:19.856
Superstar barista, Lucas Lee,
at your service.

23:19.856 --> 23:20.816
Whatever.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.402
- Whatever?
- Yeah, whatever.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.618
Yeah, it's so annoying.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.704
But the tips are good,
and I do get to look at his butt all day.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.592
Yeah, I'm spending the money
I got for starring as myself

23:47.592 --> 23:50.720
in this major Canadian motion picture
that never got made.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.640
<i>Un café, s’il vous plaît.</i>

23:54.266 --> 23:55.350
<i>Même pour moi.</i>

23:59.104 --> 24:02.482
Another Canadian abroad?
Our French is terrible.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.739
Sparks are real?

24:40.187 --> 24:48.653
<i>I've liked you for a thousand years
A thousand years</i>

24:48.653 --> 24:51.323
<i>- I've liked you for a thousand years
- I can't wait until I see you</i>

24:51.323 --> 24:52.866
<i>A thousand years</i>

24:52.866 --> 24:57.329
<i>I've liked you for a thousand years
A thousand years</i>

24:59.789 --> 25:02.375
Time for the real game to begin.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.378
The Goose is loose. Honk-honk, fu**ers.
