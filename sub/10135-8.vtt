17:38.391 --> 17:41.310
Let's see if we can get a word

17:38.391 --> 17:41.310
with her. Oh, Miss Tanner.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.855
Dad, what are you

17:41.352 --> 17:43.855
doing back here?

17:43.897 --> 17:47.316
As focused as she is,

17:43.897 --> 17:47.316
she still knows I'm her father.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.944
Steph, listen to me,

17:47.358 --> 17:49.944
I got some great news.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.155
I'm sitting next to the director

17:49.986 --> 17:53.155
of the Bayview Dance Academy

17:53.197 --> 17:54.908
if he likes your

17:53.197 --> 17:54.908
performance tonight

17:54.949 --> 17:57.451
we can get you into

17:54.949 --> 17:57.451
their summer dance camp.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.663
So I'd be dancing

17:57.493 --> 18:00.663
my whole summer vacation?

18:00.705 --> 18:02.874
Every day, nothing but dancing?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.834
Yeah. Isn't that wonderful?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.834
They're gonna start, okay?

18:04.876 --> 18:07.211
So don't be nervous. Just break

18:04.876 --> 18:07.211
a leg. And don't be nervous.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171

18:14.093 --> 18:15.678
Welcome to our recital.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.183
I'd like to remind everyone

18:18.598 --> 18:21.183
that bright flashes and lights

18:21.225 --> 18:23.143

Stephanie.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.945
What happened?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.155
I got all messed up

19:13.987 --> 19:16.155
and I didn't know what to do

19:16.196 --> 19:18.866
so I started doing anything.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.119
I guess I just don't

have what it takes.

Steph, you had that

19:25.623 --> 19:29.002
routine down cold.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.129
I think you blew it on purpose.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.172
Why would I do that?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.674
I was wondering

19:33.213 --> 19:34.674
the same thing.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.760
Okay, I blew it on purpose.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.430
But I thought this was

19:39.219 --> 19:41.430
something you really wanted.

19:41.472 --> 19:44.142
It was, at first.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.646
But then, I never

19:45.726 --> 19:48.646
got to see my friends.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.857
I missed the baby shower..

19:50.898 --> 19:54.568

19:50.898 --> 19:54.568
to do anything fun.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.904
I don't wanna go

19:54.610 --> 19:56.904

19:58.447 --> 20:01.826
Steph, if you wanted to quit,

19:58.447 --> 20:01.826
why didn't you just tell me?

20:01.868 --> 20:04.704
How could I? I begged

20:01.868 --> 20:04.704
you to let me do this.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.457
I didn't want

20:06.205 --> 20:08.457
to let you down.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.751
I would have understood.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.462
Dad, you had me

20:10.793 --> 20:13.462
starring on Broadway.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.049
And you were doing high jumps

20:13.504 --> 20:16.049
in the chorus line.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.887
Maybe I did get

20:17.842 --> 20:20.887
a little carried away, huh?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.514
So you're not

20:20.928 --> 20:23.514
disappointed in me?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.183
No.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.809

20:26.851 --> 20:29.687

20:26.851 --> 20:29.687
