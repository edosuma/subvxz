Today Sam Riley
kicked a soccer ball...

00:04.677 --> 00:07.763
and it hit another kid so hard
his eye popped out.

00:07.847 --> 00:09.265
Awesome!

00:09.348 --> 00:11.225
<i>Rgally?
HIS eye popped out.</i>

00:11.350 --> 00:13.787
Never mind. <i>[Phil] Well, gotta hit
the sack. Blg Saturday tomorrow.</i>

00:13.811 --> 00:16.355
That's right.
It's somebody's birthday.

00:16.439 --> 00:18.524
Not just that.
The iPad comes out...

00:18.608 --> 00:20.693
On my actual birthday.

00:20.776 --> 00:23.905
It's like Steve Jobs and God got
together to say, “We love you, Phil.”

00:24.030 --> 00:27.450
What is so great about that doohickey
anyhow? “Doohickey,” Elly May?

00:27.533 --> 00:31.162
It's a movie theater,
3 library and a music store...

00:31.245 --> 00:33.831
all rolled into one awesome pad.

00:33.915 --> 00:36.375
<i>A library is a place
where people get books.</i>

00:36.459 --> 00:39.378
A movie theater is a place
where people go on dates.

00:39.462 --> 00:42.524
I better load the beach chair into the trunk.
I'm gonna need it for the line in the morning.

00:42.548 --> 00:45.927
Wait, honey. Hang on. You
can't spend your birthday in line.

00:46.010 --> 00:49.263
Well, not the whole day. I have to
be there at 6:00, or forget about it.

00:49.388 --> 00:51.515
Then I'm out by 10:00.
Why don't you let me do it?

00:51.599 --> 00:53.434
Claire, you don't
have to do that.

00:53.517 --> 00:55.478
No, I know, but I want to.

00:55.561 --> 01:00.149
And that way on your birthday you'll
wake up and you'll have your brand-new toy.

01:01.525 --> 01:03.069
Okay.

01:03.152 --> 01:05.446
Well, in spite of you
calling it a toy,

01:05.529 --> 01:08.449
this is shaping up to top
the best birthday I ever had.

01:08.532 --> 01:11.494
Oh, thank God we didn't have to
hear that stupid story about that place...

01:11.619 --> 01:13.829
It was called the Fun
Zone. I was 11. <i>[ Groans]</i>

01:13.913 --> 01:16.916
I hit 10 straight fastballs
in the batting cage.

01:16.999 --> 01:20.836
Then my best friend Jeff Sweeney
stepped in and took one in the groin.

01:20.920 --> 01:25.424
I yelled out “Ball two!”
Everybody laughed.

01:25.508 --> 01:27.843
That was when I knew
I was funny.

01:29.553 --> 01:31.806
Good night.

01:31.889 --> 01:35.810
B-E-L-I-E-V-E.
Believe.

01:35.893 --> 01:38.437
Are you sure there's not
an “E-I” in the middle?

01:38.562 --> 01:40.273
No. It's “I-E.”
Good, <i>pap/I</i>

01:40.356 --> 01:43.359
If I can't fool you, then your
teachers can't fool you either.

01:43.442 --> 01:45.861
I don't think
they're trying to fool me.

01:45.945 --> 01:47.923
Wait until you see what
I got Phil for his birthday.

01:47.947 --> 01:50.366
I found it on
the SkyMall catalog.

01:50.449 --> 01:53.369
<i>Ay. It's not one of those
talking alarm clocks?</i>

01:53.452 --> 01:56.998
“It's 6:05. It's 6:25.
Wake up. Wake up.”

01:57.081 --> 01:59.917
<i>Even better.

02:00.001 --> 02:03.021
<i>As matter of fact, before I wrap this
thing, What say we take if for a spin?</i>

02:03.045 --> 02:06.108
- Come on, Manny. I'll teach you.
- He knows how to play. His father taught him.

02:06.132 --> 02:09.010
I'm gonna teach him real chess,
not the Colombian version.

02:09.135 --> 02:12.555
We actually use the pieces to play the
game, not smuggle stuff out of the country.

02:12.638 --> 02:15.516
Uh, I know one Colombian piece
you won't be playing with later.

02:15.641 --> 02:18.602
Manny, come on. Let's see
what you got. You'll be surprised.

02:19.645 --> 02:21.063

02:23.065 --> 02:26.777
<i>Manny's an excellent player,
but Jay is a grumpy loser.</i>

02:26.861 --> 02:31.657
He mopes, he makes the face, he slams the
door, then he said he didn't slam the door.

02:31.741 --> 02:34.327
It's better that he wins.

There's a man in Lily's room!

about our chess match yesterday.

Hey, what do you say
we play again? I'm good.

04:24.770 --> 04:26.814
That's the spirit.

Now you are making me
want to play again.

should ever come, I'll give you...

Now remember, try to open up
the middle of the board.

05:02.475 --> 05:04.810
I'd have moved that guy
two spaces.

05:04.894 --> 05:07.104
More aggressive.

05:07.188 --> 05:10.399
And you don't want to bring
your queen out that quickly.

with that, but now you're vulnerable...

Huh? What?

05:17.239 --> 05:19.241
How'd you do that?

05:22.077 --> 05:24.597
You will not believe what's going on
at Jake and Debbie's house.

05:24.622 --> 05:27.458
Who? The people on the
monitor. They must live nearby.

05:27.541 --> 05:29.210
So much drama.

05:29.293 --> 05:32.087
Okay, Jake told Debbie
that he had to work late.

05:32.171 --> 05:35.799
So she called his boss and
found out that he didn't. Busted!

05:35.883 --> 05:39.720
So she spent all morning on the phone crying
and crying and crying to her mother...

05:39.803 --> 05:44.475
and said if Jake has to work “late”
one more time, she's filing for divorce.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.061

But not you. No, you
sprung right into action.
