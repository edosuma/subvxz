00:20.437 --> 00:21.813
What are you doing?

00:21.896 --> 00:22.731
COURTHOUSE

00:23.690 --> 00:24.649
Excuse me.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.573
What's wrong with you?

00:32.282 --> 00:33.241
What is it?

00:35.618 --> 00:36.703
I...

00:39.247 --> 00:40.457
I will save you.

00:51.676 --> 00:52.969
I'll save you.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.515
You saved my life,

00:59.684 --> 01:01.019
so I'll save yours.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.441
Stop being so pitiful
over some stupid illness,

01:06.775 --> 01:08.485
you frustrating woman!

01:18.161 --> 01:19.537
Did you know about your illness

01:20.705 --> 01:22.582
when you agreed to the contract?

01:25.794 --> 01:26.920
Tell me.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.715
Did you know about it?

01:36.596 --> 01:37.680
Yes.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.812
What if you had died?

01:44.896 --> 01:46.397
How could you be so reckless?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.860
Were you that desperate?

01:56.407 --> 01:57.367
Yes.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.454
I was that desperate.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.169
That was the only choice I had.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.881
You foolish idiot.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.634
Please divorce me.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.596
I need...

02:21.975 --> 02:24.769
You're not enough for me.

02:25.728 --> 02:26.813
What else do you need?

02:28.106 --> 02:29.065
Money?

02:33.444 --> 02:34.654
You know, then.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.491
Give me your seal.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.495
If you need money that much,

02:44.247 --> 02:45.665
just use me.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.962
-Why do you need a divorce?
-Divorce me!

02:58.428 --> 02:59.971
Do you know how agonizing it is for me

03:02.390 --> 03:04.684
to keep up this marriage?

03:08.229 --> 03:09.564
It's exhausting

03:11.649 --> 03:12.859
and suffocating.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.572
Don't you know what that means?

03:19.198 --> 03:20.241
Don't you?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.415
Fine.

03:29.834 --> 03:30.919
Okay.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.130
I'll give you the divorce.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.133
I will, okay?

03:39.177 --> 03:40.261
However,

03:41.512 --> 03:43.264
this doesn't mean I'm giving up on you.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.101
Promise me one thing.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.731
That from now on,

03:54.025 --> 03:55.693
you'll do whatever I say.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.696
Then I'll divorce you.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.993
Promise me.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.831
Promise me!

05:03.720 --> 05:04.804
So?

05:04.929 --> 05:05.930
Did you get it?

05:06.014 --> 05:07.932
You are so impatient.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.809
Don't worry.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.436
I'll take care of it,

05:11.644 --> 05:14.397
so just get my money ready.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.648
Do it right.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.943
If everything goes smoothly,
that money won't even compare.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.071
Dad.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.115
Who was that?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.035
We had a minor problem
with a collaboration partner.

05:27.618 --> 05:28.828
What problem?

05:28.911 --> 05:31.247
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.207
Have you eaten?

05:46.137 --> 05:49.265
JI-HUN

06:00.777 --> 06:03.237
-Hello.
-You've become even prettier.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.739
Is Hye-su here?

06:05.698 --> 06:06.699
She's off today.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.992
Liar.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.702
Hey.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.955
You weren't fired. You're still here.

06:13.915 --> 06:14.999
What is it?

06:15.750 --> 06:16.751
Hey.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.628
Hello, sir.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.463
Why are you looking for Hye-su?

06:20.963 --> 06:23.549
I was in the area

06:23.633 --> 06:25.301
and wanted to see her.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.680
Leave while I'm asking you nicely.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.267
I'll come back next time.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.019
Have a nice day.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.399
Don't go.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.321
Did you call for me?

06:46.072 --> 06:47.782
Find out whether or not

06:48.241 --> 06:49.742
Ji-hun got a divorce.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.035
Yes, sir.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.037
There's no need.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.042
Where are you coming from?

06:59.043 --> 07:00.253
From the courthouse.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.755
We got the divorce.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.967
You did? Good.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.177
Sit down.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.223
Let's have dinner with Na-yoon's family.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.308
It's not a formal meeting
between the families.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.436
Think of it as a simple introduction.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.480
Don't disgrace me any longer.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.483
Dad.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.152
Yes?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.028
I'll work hard.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.156
Good.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.158
You finally got your head on straight.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.243
From now on,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.788
I'll work so much harder.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.624
I'll do everything you want me to.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.170
But

07:42.753 --> 07:44.005
I have a request.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.260
Let me date Hye-su.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.348
Please let me date her.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.225
If you let me do that,

07:56.684 --> 07:59.020
I'll do everything you want me to.
I'll devote my life to my work.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.981
I can recover the losses you'll incur

08:02.231 --> 08:04.525
from my not marrying Na-yoon.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.029
You've been brainwashed.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.574
What if I refuse?

08:14.202 --> 08:15.411
I'll still date her.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.164
No matter what you say,

08:19.749 --> 08:20.833
I'll date her.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.668
You crazy fool.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.420
Have you lost your mind?

08:32.470 --> 08:34.555
-Hey... Is she sleeping?
-Yes.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.810
Ta-da.

08:41.103 --> 08:44.106
A new snack shop opened nearby.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.443
It's really good.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.779
Their deep-fried snacks are a work of art.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.197
Try some.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.740
You have them.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.158
I don't feel so great.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.452
Really?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.038
Gosh.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.333
Try just one, then.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.757
-Will you be okay?
-Yes.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.261
Is it good?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.597
My gosh.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.891
This reminds me of the old days.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.187
When my dad lost everything,

09:23.271 --> 09:25.439
we went here and there,
living off of people.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.108
Do you remember

09:27.692 --> 09:29.610
when I'd go to your house after school

09:29.694 --> 09:33.072
and eat your grandma's tteokbokki
and steamed buns?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.700
Oh my gosh.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.702
That's what kept me going.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.747
Your grandma's cooking was a work of art,

09:41.914 --> 09:42.873
wasn't it?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.501
Yes.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.171
I was so thankful to you.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.635
You'd always pack a whole bunch of food

09:54.719 --> 09:56.304
for me and my siblings.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.140
On that note,

09:59.223 --> 10:00.433
have one more.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.768
It's okay.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.107
Come on, Hye-su.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.067
Eat and be strong.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.155
Let's live here together
for a very long time,

10:14.280 --> 10:15.364
okay?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.703
You liked that man

10:21.662 --> 10:22.955
a lot, didn't you?

10:25.750 --> 10:26.834
What?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.295
Don't be so surprised.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.631
Come on.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.884
I've worked with customers for years.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.886
I'm quick witted. I can tell that much.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.139
Why didn't you tell him

10:40.640 --> 10:42.141
that you couldn't divorce him?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.311
You should've clung to his legs

10:46.479 --> 10:47.855
and refused.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.411
Gosh.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.916
Maybe I should have.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.921
I should've just asked him
to be my husband.

11:23.766 --> 11:24.892
What are you doing?

11:25.476 --> 11:27.520
-Eun-seong is awake.
-You're awake.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.693
What are you eating?

11:34.777 --> 11:37.071
Auntie brought some deep-fried snacks.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.239
Do you want some?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.659
Good girl.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.580
I love you, Eun-seong.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.168
These are the MRI results
and the diagnosis.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.421
Thank you.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.382
You should've gotten involved sooner.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.843
I wish you the best.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.261
Thanks.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.620
Thank you for everything.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.123
Thank you, Chef.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.375
If you're grateful,
then you shouldn't quit.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.043
I'm sorry.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.546
I'll come visit every now and then.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.924
You're quitting because Mr. Han
is bugging you, aren't you?

12:39.258 --> 12:40.342
I know it all.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.052
No, that's not it.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.137
Yes, it is.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.639
He ends up causing trouble after all.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.850
You should've just sued him.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.393
Sorry?

12:49.810 --> 12:52.688
We need to have a farewell party.
I'll set a date and let you know.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.981
Let's have a drink.

12:55.691 --> 12:56.859
Thank you.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.696
By the way, do you still have debt left
with that loan shark?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.364
Sorry?

13:03.491 --> 13:04.575
No.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.536
Never mind. I was just asking.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.704
Forget it.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.581
Good work, Hye-su.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.047
-Hey, what are you...
-Thank you for everything.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.256
Hye-su.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.091
I...

13:24.220 --> 13:25.679
Hye-su.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.681
Can I have a word?

13:28.807 --> 13:29.808
This is all your fault.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.394
Gosh, why is it my fault?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.438
Tell Mr. Han he'd better watch out, okay?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.110
The cherry blossoms are so pretty.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.948
How pretty.

13:47.743 --> 13:48.661
Gosh.

13:49.828 --> 13:50.955
I'm sorry you had a tough time.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.415
No. I'm the one who's sorry.

13:53.832 --> 13:57.211
Why are you sorry?
I'm the one who's sorry about much more.

13:57.753 --> 13:59.088
What are you sorry about?

14:00.548 --> 14:01.882
To be honest,

14:02.424 --> 14:04.093
I knew how Ji-hun felt,

14:04.176 --> 14:05.636
but I pretended like I didn't know.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.975
I've known him for over 20 years,

14:11.517 --> 14:13.769
but I've never seen him like that.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.689
He's having a really hard time
because of you.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.318
To be honest,
he acts like a madman these days.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.281
I'm a coward,

14:25.573 --> 14:27.908
so I just stood by and watched.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.493
That's what I'm sorry about.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.121
It's okay.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.164
You don't need to be sorry.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.836
My goodness.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.505
So...

14:42.298 --> 14:43.674
So is this really the end?

14:44.550 --> 14:45.593
When are you free?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.052
Let's have a drink.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.180
Mr. Park.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.682
No.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.435
By the way,

14:54.727 --> 14:56.437
how's your friend?

14:56.645 --> 14:57.730
Ju-yeon?

14:59.648 --> 15:03.068
Please bring Ju-yeon with you.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.528
Okay?

15:11.535 --> 15:12.620
Hye-su!

15:14.204 --> 15:15.289
Good luck!

15:15.581 --> 15:16.832
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.334
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.960
-Goodbye.
-Come visit.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.093
Look at you.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.762
Did something good happen?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.639
Not at all.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.059
Mom, I can't even sleep these days.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.604
-Why not?
-It's shocking the more I think about it.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.482
I mean, it's organ trafficking.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.192
It's something you only hear about.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.444
Does this even make sense?

15:45.527 --> 15:46.528
Jeong-hun.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.948
How dare he do something like that?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.617
Everyone talks about the wealthy
abusing their power.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.577
What if people find out about
what Ji-hun did?

15:53.869 --> 15:56.372
Our company will be destroyed
in an instant, don't you think?

15:56.455 --> 15:59.583
I told you not to go around
talking about it.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.127
I'm not stupid. Why would I do that?

16:02.586 --> 16:04.421
I'm just dumbfounded, that's all.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.216
I can imagine how angry Dad must've been.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.760
And you must have been shocked too.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.054
That ungrateful punk.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.139
The Chairman is home.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.772
You're home late.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.654
He won't even acknowledge us anymore,
is that it?

17:07.943 --> 17:09.194
When did you come?

17:10.070 --> 17:11.155
Drink.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.752
I'm fine.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.925
Look at your hands.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.510
They're skin and bones.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.726
Let's go and eat.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.329
Here.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.961
Here.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.213
My gosh.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.173
Eat up and gain some weight.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.530
Just wait a little longer, okay?

18:34.863 --> 18:36.156
I'll have good news for you soon.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.828
I told you I'll save you.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.038
I meant every word, so just wait.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.808
Look at you,
spilling your food everywhere.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.685
Here.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.063
Wipe your mouth.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.151
Don't come anymore.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.735
I'll get into trouble if I don't.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.445
That doctor is really scary.

19:17.781 --> 19:18.949
You have no fear.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.869
How could you come alone
for such a difficult treatment?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.871
It's fine even if I do.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.789
It's not a big deal.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.474
Hurry up and eat.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.518
I want to go home and rest.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.942
What are you doing?

19:54.610 --> 19:55.611
-What are you--
-Gosh.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.737
Just eat.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.364
-Mr. Han.
-I told you not to call me that.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.036
JI-HUN

20:05.287 --> 20:06.705
SPEED DIAL

20:07.623 --> 20:08.582
ADD CONTACT

20:09.374 --> 20:10.584
If anything happens,

20:10.792 --> 20:12.336
I'm on speed dial number one.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.879
I'll be on standby.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.298
Contact me whenever you're bored, hungry,

20:16.381 --> 20:17.382
or want to go somewhere.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.301
Or if you want to watch a movie,

20:22.012 --> 20:23.222
or want a hug or a kiss.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.232
Aren't you angry?

20:34.733 --> 20:36.526
There's so much you didn't get
to do with me.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.614
I'm angry.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.324
We didn't get to do anything together,

20:42.616 --> 20:43.700
but you ran away.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.788
I was almost dumped without knowing why.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.541
Maybe I should be thankful.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.626
I'm done with my meal.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.211
Don't act like you're not glad to see me.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.005
I'll come tomorrow and the day after.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.882
I'm not going to let you go.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.512
I'm going to follow you around
for the rest of my life.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.198
Don't follow me. I'm going alone.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.502
I told you not to follow me.
I'm going alone.

21:39.631 --> 21:40.882
Have you forgotten your promise?

21:41.675 --> 21:43.135
Your promise in exchange for the divorce.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.761
I never made such a promise.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.931
Fine. I'll follow you until you remember.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.433
Please leave.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.727
Please go.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.895
I don't want to be treated like a patient.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.315
That's more like it.

22:00.527 --> 22:01.903
Let me make myself clear.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.781
I'll say it one more time for you.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.826
I find you burdensome.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.455
I feel free now that we're divorced.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.834
Just leave.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.753
Or else, I'll report you for stalking me.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.736
HEART NAIL

22:45.781 --> 22:46.990
It's been a while.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.576
Why is it so hard to find you?

22:49.826 --> 22:50.911
Are you busy?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.455
What is it?

22:53.622 --> 22:54.831
How's the kid?

22:55.123 --> 22:56.208
Leave.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.418
I have no business left with you.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.295
Come now.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.839
We've known each other for years.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.674
You're hurting my feelings.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.676
Buy me some coffee.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.261
Why are you doing this?

23:08.929 --> 23:12.307
I wondered how you were able to
pay back your debt so fast.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.017
I guess you found a way.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.604
I thought you were innocent,
but you're quite impressive.

23:19.606 --> 23:20.816
I heard you sold your liver.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.697
Where did you hear that?

23:28.448 --> 23:30.325
Finding that out is nothing.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.452
I have connections, you know?

23:34.746 --> 23:36.581
Now, how about that coffee?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.550
AFFIDAVIT

23:46.842 --> 23:48.051
What is this?

23:48.468 --> 23:51.012
This? I'm trying to help you out here.

23:51.847 --> 23:52.931
What is it?

23:53.014 --> 23:55.225
Just sign here.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.687
-Sign?
-You know Han Ji-hun, right?

23:59.354 --> 24:02.482
It says he manipulated you
into selling your liver.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.361
He threatened you and badgered you,
so you had no choice but to agree.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.364
-Look.
-What?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.241
It's the truth.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.786
Now, let's sign here.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.373
Who put you up to this?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.750
Am I one to take orders?

24:21.501 --> 24:25.172
I'm just asking you to sign this
for social justice.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.339
Do it.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.133
Whoever put you up to this,

24:28.758 --> 24:29.843
don't go along with it.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.140
I'm not asking you to do it for free.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.184
Don't be shocked.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.769
I'll give you 500 million won.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.692
That's enough to raise your kid
until she becomes an adult, right?

24:45.775 --> 24:48.486
If you get 500 million won for signing,
this is practically the jackpot.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.654
Don't you think?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.824
Why are you hesitating?
This is a great opportunity.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.409
Get this out of my sight.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.330
And don't ever show your face again.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.667
Look here.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.086
I heard you even took money

25:05.253 --> 25:07.047
from Han Ji-hun's dad.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.049
Then why won't you take this?

25:09.674 --> 25:12.260
It's expensive to raise a kid these days.

25:12.761 --> 25:16.514
You need at least this much
to raise her properly.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.226
Don't worry.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.979
I'll make sure nothing happens to you.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.815
Just sign it, and you'll be good.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.443
Come on.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.195
You can live comfortably with this

25:30.278 --> 25:31.655
for the rest of your life.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.740
Why are you hesitating?

25:41.122 --> 25:43.917
I, KANG HYE-SU, WAS BRIBED BY HAN JI-HUN
INTO SELLING MY LIVER

25:48.463 --> 25:49.297
Hey!

25:54.386 --> 25:55.470
Hey.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.847
You shouldn't rip that.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.349
Here. Sign.

26:09.567 --> 26:10.694
You know,

26:12.570 --> 26:14.864
I may be obsessed with money.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.492
But I'm not that low.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.706
Tell them not to do this.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.209
He did nothing wrong.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.211
Have you lost your mind?

26:28.295 --> 26:29.838
You too. Don't do this.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.091
You'll regret it when you die.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.969
Gosh, you frustrating woman.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.806
Fine. It must be because you feel guilty.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.144
But this is a great deal for you.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.189
Think about it. I'll come again tomorrow.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.357
Don't come back.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.111
If you do, I'll kill you.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.039
It's been a while, Mr. Hong.

27:06.249 --> 27:09.169
We haven't been in touch lately.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.129
Let's grab a meal soon.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.550
Sounds good.

27:16.051 --> 27:19.387
Yes, I'll pick a place and let you know.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.187
Did you get it?

27:27.896 --> 27:29.230
No, not yet.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.691
What's the rush?

27:31.983 --> 27:33.151
I'll get it tomorrow.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.153
What?

27:36.738 --> 27:38.239
Why tomorrow?

27:41.242 --> 27:44.496
That woman is very timid.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.414
She was hesitant,

27:46.664 --> 27:47.957
so I put her at ease.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.168
You said you could get it right away.

27:50.293 --> 27:51.336
Didn't you?

27:51.586 --> 27:53.588
Why do I have to wait until tomorrow?

27:54.005 --> 27:56.132
You are so impatient.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.176
Are you even doing your job?

27:58.843 --> 28:00.220
I don't have time, so hurry up.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.596
Got it?

28:01.679 --> 28:02.931
Yes, sir.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.224
Here.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.893
Use both hands.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.770
Be respectful.

28:18.738 --> 28:21.282
Punk. You know who I am, right?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.410
Of course, I do.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.293
Think about it.

28:32.669 --> 28:33.753
I'll come again tomorrow.

28:33.878 --> 28:34.963
Don't hurt him.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.259
Tell whoever it is that if they hurt him,

28:41.344 --> 28:43.012
I'll kill them.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.016
Why are you so deep in thought?

28:48.101 --> 28:49.185
Aren't you tired?

28:49.519 --> 28:50.603
No.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.397
What?

28:54.816 --> 28:58.361
Gosh, you look terrible.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.532
Did the doctor

29:03.074 --> 29:04.743
give you bad news?

29:06.494 --> 29:08.204
No, that's not it.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.835
Ju-yeon.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.211
Yes?

29:15.295 --> 29:17.505
I'm going to take a trip tomorrow.

29:19.674 --> 29:20.759
A trip?

29:22.135 --> 29:23.219
Yes.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.596
I feel a bit empty

29:25.180 --> 29:26.931
after quitting my job.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.478
That's a great idea.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.272
But will you be okay going alone?

29:34.898 --> 29:35.982
Do you want me to go with you?

29:36.524 --> 29:37.609
It's okay.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.110
You just go to work.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.029
I want to go alone.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.866
Don't worry.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.535
My condition's not that bad yet.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.330
I'll make sure to take plenty
of medication.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.293
Eun-seong.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.588
Remember that lady you met
at Auntie's house last time?

29:59.005 --> 30:02.258
She came with Seung-ju.
Do you remember her?

30:04.010 --> 30:05.261
That lady?

30:05.553 --> 30:06.971
I remember her. Why?

30:07.305 --> 30:08.973
Shall we go and see her?

30:10.350 --> 30:11.518
The truth is...

30:12.101 --> 30:13.853
The truth is,

30:15.396 --> 30:17.065
she is

30:17.899 --> 30:19.567
your real grandma.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.153
My real grandma?

30:22.737 --> 30:24.823
Yes. She's Dad's mom.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.491
Grandma.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.661
You know how Yul-jin, Jun,

30:29.744 --> 30:31.746
and Ri-na all have grandmas?

30:32.372 --> 30:34.457
That lady is your real grandma.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.125
Really?

30:36.918 --> 30:38.545
That lady

30:39.671 --> 30:41.756
is my dad's mom?

30:43.842 --> 30:44.926
Yes.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.471
I'm sorry for hiding it from you.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.516
Eun-seong,

30:51.850 --> 30:55.353
Grandma loved your dad very much.

30:56.312 --> 30:59.899
But because your dad went
to heaven way too soon,

31:00.400 --> 31:03.069
she was very angry.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.905
That's why she didn't want to see anyone,

31:06.155 --> 31:08.575
including me.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.036
But ever since she met you,

31:12.245 --> 31:14.205
she hasn't been angry anymore.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.375
So now, we get along.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.044
It's all thanks to you.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.800
Eun-seong.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.344
People meet

31:28.970 --> 31:32.807
and part ways, and they hate each other
because they love each other.

31:34.684 --> 31:35.977
It's hard, isn't it?

31:36.519 --> 31:38.813
What's so hard?

31:39.314 --> 31:41.024
You should just get along.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.609
You're right.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.652
We should just get along.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.781
But it's hard for me.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.744
Life seems to be
full of homework assignments for me.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.872
If I finish one,

31:55.955 --> 31:57.165
there's another one,

31:57.582 --> 31:58.750
another one,

31:59.334 --> 32:00.418
and another one.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.503
I hate homework.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.173
I know.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.800
I hate homework too.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.972
Goodness, this is so hard.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.067
Aunt.

32:24.651 --> 32:25.902
Hye-su is here.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.114
Go on.

32:30.239 --> 32:31.449
Eun-seong.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.205
My baby.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.166
You're so pretty.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.168
That's enough already.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.087
Stop that.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.714
Why are you crying, Grandma?

32:48.049 --> 32:49.133
Because I'm happy.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.012
Because I like you so much, Eun-seong.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.264
If you're happy, you should laugh.

32:57.809 --> 32:58.893
You're right.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.645
If I'm happy, I should laugh.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.194
Mother.

33:11.572 --> 33:14.242
Hye-su, thank you so much.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.285
I was missing her so much lately.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.914
Thank you for bringing her here.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.419
Eun-seong,

33:24.669 --> 33:26.170
is there anything you want to eat?

33:26.587 --> 33:28.423
I'll make you anything.

33:28.548 --> 33:29.632
Really?

33:30.174 --> 33:33.219
Of course. I'll make you anything.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.512
Eun-seong, come here.

33:34.846 --> 33:35.972
Have you had breakfast?

33:36.055 --> 33:37.015
Not yet.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.266
Give me a few minutes.

33:38.558 --> 33:39.684
I'll help you.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.020
-That one.
-This one?

33:42.562 --> 33:44.063
-Mother.
-Yes?

33:44.939 --> 33:47.775
Could you watch Eun-seong for me?

33:48.276 --> 33:49.777
I want to take a short trip.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.155
Now that I've quit my job,

33:52.447 --> 33:53.656
I want to take a trip.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.159
That's a great idea.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.870
You have no idea how worried I've been

33:58.953 --> 34:00.747
because you haven't been looking well.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.125
This isn't much,

34:04.292 --> 34:07.295
but go somewhere nice
and get plenty of rest.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.214
Thank you.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.719
And I'm glad you broke up with that jerk.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.347
Thanks to that,
I can see Eun-seong freely now.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.351
I'll make breakfast.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.274
That will be all for today.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.692
Thank you, everyone.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.694
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.947
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.242
Mr. Han, you've done so much already
after becoming the executive director.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.079
When did you prepare for
the venture in China?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.789
It's only the beginning.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.584
The way you initiate your plans
is always impressive, Mr. Han.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.462
-Thank you.
-Look at you.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.423
Congratulations.

34:52.673 --> 34:53.758
Let's talk.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.385
I'm busy. I have to go.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.554
The company's name is at stake.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.724
Don't run away, Executive Director Han.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.269
You should resign.

35:05.561 --> 35:06.771
Resign?

35:08.064 --> 35:10.108
Place your hand on your heart,
and think about it.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.319
-Is there nothing you feel guilty about?
-What do you mean?

35:13.402 --> 35:15.029
There's a strange rumor going around.

35:15.696 --> 35:16.781
Haven't you heard?

35:18.533 --> 35:19.617
What rumor?

35:20.284 --> 35:21.410
It's about that woman.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.079
The one from the restaurant.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.705
What's your relationship to her?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.000
Why did you register your marriage?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.337
Where did you hear that?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.757
You won't confess, is that it?

35:35.216 --> 35:36.300
Fine.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.636
May I believe what I heard?

35:40.555 --> 35:41.848
I heard you bought an organ.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.894
I hear you bought her liver
to give to your mom.

35:47.812 --> 35:48.896
How much did you give her?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.650
You didn't use
the company's funds, did you?

35:53.985 --> 35:54.944
Jeong-hun.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.614
My goodness.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.868
Why are you suddenly calling me
so lovingly like that?

36:01.951 --> 36:04.662
You never even treated me
like your brother.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.789
Look at you being nice
now that you need me.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.292
You cunning punk.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.213
Who told you?

36:14.547 --> 36:15.631
Was it Dad?

36:15.715 --> 36:17.216
Word is out already.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.802
Just wait until the police call you in.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.513
What will happen then?

36:22.889 --> 36:24.223
Have you thought about that?

36:25.683 --> 36:27.518
But then again, the surgery didn't happen,

36:27.602 --> 36:29.645
so I guess you'll get out it.

36:29.812 --> 36:31.606
But what about the company's image?

36:32.356 --> 36:33.733
You know the world is a scary place.

36:35.234 --> 36:38.696
Leave on your own first,
before the company collapses

36:39.113 --> 36:40.448
because of you.

36:41.282 --> 36:44.160
I'll stop the police from investigating
and the media from talking.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.204
You've been a bad son all these years.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.873
It's time to get your act together now.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.793
Why won't you and your mom ever grow up?

36:58.799 --> 37:00.384
Give up your position as director,

37:01.594 --> 37:03.304
and go back quietly to the States.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.097
Go back to your old partying ways.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.100
If this gets out,
I won't be able to do anything about it.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.353
So resign before then.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.855
I'm saying this for your own good.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.690
Don't think ill of me.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.945
Got it?

37:45.846 --> 37:47.056
How do you feel?

37:47.723 --> 37:48.975
-Good.
-All right.

37:49.183 --> 37:51.018
-Hello.
-Hello.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.188
You heard, right?
The surgery will be tomorrow afternoon.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.439
Yes.

37:55.731 --> 37:58.609
Since they're siblings,
they are an excellent match.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.653
He's a much better match than your wife.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.113
Thank you.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.449
If you take good care of yourself,
there won't be any problems,

38:05.700 --> 38:06.826
so rest assured.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.619
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.329
Thank you.

38:15.543 --> 38:16.627
Congratulations, Mom.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.130
It's too soon for that.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.466
After the surgery is over,

38:23.259 --> 38:25.428
can you ask her to come and see me?

38:28.597 --> 38:31.017
I keep thinking about her.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.895
I heard she cried, saying she was sorry.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.398
Tell her she shouldn't be

38:38.316 --> 38:39.567
and that I want to see her.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.820
Okay.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.072
How's the kid?

38:47.575 --> 38:48.659
Eun-seong?

38:48.868 --> 38:49.952
Yes, Eun-seong.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.749
I can't stop thinking about her.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.876
She's such a bright kid.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.546
Don't get me started.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.173
No one compares.

39:04.592 --> 39:05.676
Ji-hun.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.640
I'll let you rest. Bye.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.411
I've been caught.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.289
I was just going to drop this off.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.044
I'm sorry.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.546
I knew you'd tell me not to come
if I asked.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.423
It's okay.

39:46.675 --> 39:48.260
Has the surgery date been set?

39:49.303 --> 39:50.304
Yes.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.515
I'm glad you found a donor.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.062
Ji-hun.

39:58.604 --> 39:59.688
Na-yoon,

40:00.648 --> 40:01.857
let me go first.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.112
Forget about me.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.156
Don't come anymore, either.

40:13.869 --> 40:14.954
In the past,

40:15.746 --> 40:17.039
I liked you a great deal.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.543
My feelings were genuine.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.254
I can't deny that.

40:26.715 --> 40:27.842
I'm sorry, Na-yoon.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.262
I hope you find a better guy.

40:55.828 --> 40:56.912
I...

40:59.290 --> 41:00.374
I will save you.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.348
JI-HUN

41:16.640 --> 41:18.142
Hey lady, have you thought about it?

41:21.979 --> 41:23.689
POWER OFF

41:59.308 --> 42:01.393
CALLING KANG HYE-SU

42:01.477 --> 42:02.686
The phone has been turned off.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.980
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.649
Please leave a message after the tone.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.449
Thank you.

42:17.576 --> 42:18.494
Okay.

42:19.495 --> 42:21.163
Your blood pressure is quite high.

42:21.747 --> 42:23.791
You must be under a lot of stress.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.169
You have no idea.

42:27.378 --> 42:29.255
I have so much going on lately.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.131
Be careful.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.259
What if you collapse again?

42:33.676 --> 42:37.555
Leave the business to your sons,
and don't work too hard.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.766
I wish I could.

42:42.309 --> 42:44.395
I needed to talk to you

42:45.020 --> 42:46.939
about something anyway.

42:47.398 --> 42:48.482
What is it?

42:48.774 --> 42:52.152
Your eldest son took a copy
of your medical records.

42:52.528 --> 42:53.612
Jeong-hun?

42:54.113 --> 42:55.781
Why would he do that?

42:56.574 --> 42:58.826
I thought that was strange too.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.662
Okay. I'll look into it.

43:02.329 --> 43:04.248
Also, one more thing.

43:04.331 --> 43:05.416
What now?

43:05.666 --> 43:09.044
I was asked to keep it a secret,

43:09.295 --> 43:12.131
but I thought you should know.

43:13.549 --> 43:15.676
Your younger son came by.

43:16.051 --> 43:17.136
Ji-hun?

43:17.595 --> 43:20.139
He asked me to introduce him
to Dr. Parsons

43:20.306 --> 43:22.516
at MD Anderson in Houston,

43:22.933 --> 43:24.518
so I did.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.812
Who is he?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.189
He's a brain tumor specialist.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.650
He's the best in the field.

43:31.734 --> 43:32.818
Brain tumor?

43:33.777 --> 43:35.029
MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS

43:35.112 --> 43:37.031
It seems that Kang Hye-su is indeed sick.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.242
These are her medical records
and doctor's note.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.162
This punk.

43:44.079 --> 43:45.456
He's out of his mind.

43:48.959 --> 43:52.379
A-ra, I love you

43:52.463 --> 43:53.922
-A-ra...
-Hey.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.675
-Why are you here?
-It's been a while.

43:56.925 --> 43:58.969
-Is Hye-su here?
-Why are you here?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.680
What are you getting angry for?

44:01.764 --> 44:02.848
What is this punk?

44:02.931 --> 44:04.600
-You're back.
-What...

44:04.683 --> 44:05.976
Come on, guys.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.228
I'm here as a customer.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.396
I came to eat some pasta.

44:10.731 --> 44:11.815
Gosh.

44:12.816 --> 44:15.361
Our restaurant doesn't serve food
to jerks like you.

44:15.611 --> 44:16.695
Get out.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.156
What? Do you own this place?

44:19.406 --> 44:22.242
What is it? What's going on?

44:23.911 --> 44:26.163
Yes, I own the place. What about it?

44:26.955 --> 44:29.833
She said she paid off her debt.
Why are you back?

44:30.751 --> 44:34.213
Gosh, I'm too scared to eat pasta here.

44:34.296 --> 44:37.049
How dare you talk down
to a customer and intimidate him?

44:37.132 --> 44:39.051
Do you think this is the only pasta place
around here?

44:39.134 --> 44:40.219
Darn it.

44:41.095 --> 44:42.805
-Hey.
-Wait.

44:42.888 --> 44:43.847
Stop.

44:48.143 --> 44:49.228
Hello?

44:50.646 --> 44:52.356
Gosh, stop rushing me.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.942
I'm risking my life here.

44:55.150 --> 44:56.110
You punk.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.195
Are you sure
you're doing your job properly?

44:58.529 --> 45:01.990
I told you I'll get it to you by today.
How many times do I have to tell you?

45:02.741 --> 45:06.703
That woman needs to change her mind
for me to get her to sign it.

45:08.330 --> 45:10.624
-Let's talk outside. Please.
-Get away!

45:13.085 --> 45:15.129
I know it's urgent,
but there's an order to everything.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.839
Darn it.

45:17.339 --> 45:18.424
Sir.

45:18.924 --> 45:20.384
-Listen...
-You punk.

45:20.717 --> 45:22.094
-Hey.
-Are you insane?

45:22.678 --> 45:23.762
What's your deal?

45:23.846 --> 45:24.972
And what's yours?

45:25.347 --> 45:26.181
Damn it!

45:27.057 --> 45:28.142
Gosh.

45:32.479 --> 45:33.814
-Why you...
-Hey!

45:35.941 --> 45:36.984
-My arm.
-Punk.

45:37.067 --> 45:37.985
-Let go.
-You punk.

45:38.068 --> 45:39.778
-You need a beating.
-You jerk.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.238
Watch what you say.

45:41.321 --> 45:43.073
You punk.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.408
-Get over here.
-Let go.

45:44.491 --> 45:45.534
HAN JEONG-HUN

45:45.993 --> 45:47.077
Let go.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.204
Hey, that's an invasion of my privacy!

45:49.329 --> 45:50.456
What did he ask you to do?

45:50.539 --> 45:51.665
What do you mean?

45:51.748 --> 45:53.375
What did he ask you to do?

45:53.459 --> 45:55.127
He didn't ask me to do anything.

45:55.669 --> 45:56.670
Come with me.

45:56.753 --> 45:58.422
-Wait.
-My arm!

45:58.505 --> 46:00.924
-Stop it.
-My arm is twisted!

46:01.550 --> 46:02.634
Mr. Han...

46:15.063 --> 46:16.190
Why did you send that jerk?

46:18.150 --> 46:20.110
Why did you send that jerk to Hye-su?

46:20.319 --> 46:21.987
Why are you so worked up?

46:22.446 --> 46:23.822
What did you say to her?

46:24.490 --> 46:25.574
Why are you messing with her?

46:26.450 --> 46:27.409
Do you like that chick?

46:27.493 --> 46:29.077
What did you say to her?

46:29.453 --> 46:31.663
You two are so alike.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.415
This is why genes matter.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.293
You like that con artist, is that it?

46:36.919 --> 46:40.255
Gosh, you have such high standards.

46:41.006 --> 46:42.174
What did I tell her?

46:43.133 --> 46:45.844
I demanded my dad's money back. Why?

46:46.845 --> 46:47.846
What?

46:47.930 --> 46:50.516
I said I'll have her locked up
for scamming you.

46:50.974 --> 46:53.310
I told her that
since she seduced my naive brother

46:53.393 --> 46:55.562
and turned him into an organ trafficker,

46:55.646 --> 46:57.314
she needed to pay the price.

46:57.439 --> 46:58.524
You punk.

46:58.857 --> 46:59.942
What?

47:00.734 --> 47:02.528
Did you just call your big brother a punk?

47:02.986 --> 47:04.279
If you're older, act like it.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.074
Don't mess with her.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.202
How dare you talk to me like that?

47:10.285 --> 47:11.537
I said, don't mess with her!

47:11.620 --> 47:14.498
Then resign tomorrow and get lost,
you jerk!

47:14.581 --> 47:17.251
Get lost while I'm being nice,
you poor bastard!

47:18.293 --> 47:20.462
Make sure you repent for what you did
until the day you die.

47:20.837 --> 47:22.506
Don't you dare come near our house again.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.384
Know your place, you punk!

47:27.761 --> 47:29.054
Close the gate!

48:03.088 --> 48:03.964
What is that?

48:06.466 --> 48:08.385
You got a head start.

48:10.679 --> 48:11.763
-Oh, my.
-Oh, gosh.

48:27.529 --> 48:28.614
You should go

48:29.531 --> 48:30.657
study abroad later.

48:31.325 --> 48:32.659
It's not that easy.

48:34.870 --> 48:36.038
After the surgery,

48:37.122 --> 48:38.790
I'll open a small snack shop like this

48:39.207 --> 48:41.585
and live a fun life with Eun-seong.

48:42.628 --> 48:43.795
That's my dream.

48:44.212 --> 48:45.380
A small snack shop.

48:56.016 --> 48:58.101
It isn't expensive.

48:58.185 --> 48:59.978
You should give me a tip.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.772
-Bye.
-Okay.

49:02.522 --> 49:03.607
Hello.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.359
Is Hye-su in?

49:07.861 --> 49:08.987
Hye-su isn't

49:09.863 --> 49:11.198
here right now.

49:11.573 --> 49:12.658
Where is she?

49:12.949 --> 49:14.034
She's at her in-laws' place.

49:15.410 --> 49:17.788
Yes. She went to see her in-laws.

49:23.377 --> 49:24.461
Excuse me.

49:25.003 --> 49:26.672
But why are you looking for her?

49:29.257 --> 49:30.258
Where do her in-laws live?

49:30.342 --> 49:31.635
I'm sorry,

49:32.260 --> 49:33.428
but please

49:34.221 --> 49:35.472
don't confuse her.

49:36.390 --> 49:37.599
She is having

49:38.517 --> 49:40.811
a tough time as it is.

49:42.396 --> 49:43.605
Where do her in-laws live?

49:47.651 --> 49:49.361
The phone has been turned off.
Your call will be

49:49.444 --> 49:51.279
-Did her battery die?
-forwarded to voicemail.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.824
-Please leave a message after the tone.
-Why isn't your mom picking up?

49:54.241 --> 49:55.242
Give it to me, Grandma.

49:55.367 --> 49:56.785
Press one to leave a message.

49:56.910 --> 49:58.286
I'll leave a message.

50:01.206 --> 50:03.250
Mom, it's me.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.627
Grandma is very worried

50:06.086 --> 50:07.754
because you're not answering.

50:08.004 --> 50:09.297
I'm worried too.

50:10.048 --> 50:13.343
Call us when you get this, okay?

50:16.138 --> 50:18.348
Are you hungry?

50:18.849 --> 50:21.143
I'll make you a delicious dinner.

50:21.226 --> 50:22.519
-Okay.
-Wait right here.

50:33.029 --> 50:34.114
Mister!

50:34.781 --> 50:35.866
Eun-seong.

50:39.953 --> 50:41.455
Have you been well?

50:41.538 --> 50:44.082
Yes. How are the kittens?
Are they doing well?

50:44.166 --> 50:45.667
Of course, they are.

50:46.084 --> 50:47.169
Where's Mom?

50:47.419 --> 50:49.254
Mom went on a trip.

50:49.629 --> 50:50.922
-A trip?
-Yes.

50:51.673 --> 50:52.758
Eun-seong.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.637
Why are you here?

50:58.472 --> 50:59.556
Hello.

51:00.724 --> 51:01.808
Eun-seong.

51:05.395 --> 51:07.522
Please leave. Hye-su isn't here.

51:07.689 --> 51:10.275
Do you know where she went?

51:10.859 --> 51:12.402
Why do you care?

51:12.569 --> 51:13.779
I thought you broke up with her.

51:14.070 --> 51:16.364
How pathetic.

51:17.199 --> 51:20.577
How could you shamelessly come here
and look for my daughter-in-law?

51:21.536 --> 51:23.038
Come here, Eun-seong.

51:23.330 --> 51:24.539
Come here.

51:25.916 --> 51:26.833
No...

51:27.000 --> 51:28.710
I told you to leave.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.365
JI-YEON RESTAURANT

52:01.910 --> 52:03.662
Oh no.

52:05.247 --> 52:07.040
HYE-SU'S PLACE

52:14.840 --> 52:18.260
-Come here.
-Hey. Oh my goodness.

52:24.891 --> 52:26.142
Aren't you tired?

52:26.351 --> 52:28.645
You must be tired from studying all day.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.021
Hey.

52:30.105 --> 52:31.189
What are you doing?

52:31.273 --> 52:33.483
I was trying to help you.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.318
Never mind. Here.

52:45.370 --> 52:46.496
Hye-su. Ju-yeon.

52:48.415 --> 52:49.666
I'm so scared.

52:51.334 --> 52:52.752
Oh, my.

53:05.181 --> 53:06.266
Grandma.

53:14.858 --> 53:18.236
I ended up becoming a clueless adult.

53:24.576 --> 53:25.869
I'm sorry, Grandma.

53:30.582 --> 53:33.335
I'm sorry I couldn't live a great life.

53:39.507 --> 53:40.675
I'm sorry.

55:06.344 --> 55:07.470
KANG HYE-SU

55:12.726 --> 55:13.810
Hye-su,

55:14.728 --> 55:15.895
where are you?

55:17.939 --> 55:19.315
Just tell me where you are.

55:21.359 --> 55:22.944
Tell me you're okay.

56:34.557 --> 56:36.518
Mom, it's me.

56:37.143 --> 56:38.895
Grandma is very worried

56:40.688 --> 56:42.774
because you're not answering.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.442
I'm worried too.

56:45.235 --> 56:48.446
Call us when you get this, okay?

56:50.490 --> 56:51.574
Hey, lady.

56:51.866 --> 56:53.993
Running away isn't the answer.

56:54.702 --> 56:57.288
Think about it and call me, okay?

56:58.748 --> 56:59.833
Hye-su,

57:00.500 --> 57:01.835
where are you?

57:03.211 --> 57:04.546
Just tell me where you are.

57:06.714 --> 57:08.174
Tell me you're okay.

58:38.765 --> 58:40.266
Help me.

58:41.226 --> 58:42.393
Help me.

58:43.228 --> 58:44.812
Please...

58:47.857 --> 58:50.318
JI-HUN

58:51.069 --> 58:52.445
Please...

58:57.825 --> 58:58.993
KANG HYE-SU

59:03.540 --> 59:04.624
Hye-su.

59:06.751 --> 59:07.877
Hye-su?

59:09.796 --> 59:10.964
Hye-su.

59:17.512 --> 59:18.972
I want to ask you something.

59:25.770 --> 59:26.854
Where are you?

59:29.732 --> 59:30.900
You know...

59:34.237 --> 59:35.405
I...

59:39.534 --> 59:41.828
I've become a mess.

59:44.872 --> 59:48.334
I may get much worse.

59:59.137 --> 1:00:01.598
I might become different...

1:00:07.645 --> 1:00:09.731
from the woman that you know now.

1:00:17.447 --> 1:00:18.906
Is that okay?

1:00:26.998 --> 1:00:28.082
Where are you right now?

1:00:28.374 --> 1:00:29.459
Where are you?

1:00:34.047 --> 1:00:35.757
Is that okay?

1:00:40.553 --> 1:00:42.096
Is that okay with you?

1:01:17.799 --> 1:01:18.883
Hye-su.

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:39.612
Hye-su.

1:01:52.834 --> 1:01:54.043
It's okay.

1:01:55.670 --> 1:01:56.796
Everything's okay.

1:02:00.216 --> 1:02:01.801
It's okay if you become a mess.

1:02:07.014 --> 1:02:08.099
You can become

1:02:09.058 --> 1:02:10.226
a thousand times worse than this,

1:02:11.936 --> 1:02:13.521
and it'll still be okay.

1:02:19.068 --> 1:02:21.362
No matter what happens,
everything will be okay.

1:02:25.992 --> 1:02:27.201
No matter what happens...

1:02:30.663 --> 1:02:31.956
No matter what happens,

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:36.127
you'll always be Kang Hye-su,
the woman that I love.

1:02:57.398 --> 1:02:58.441
It's okay.

1:02:59.233 --> 1:03:00.318
It's okay.

1:03:01.944 --> 1:03:03.029
It's okay.

1:03:11.078 --> 1:03:12.246
It's okay.

1:03:29.347 --> 1:03:30.431
It's okay.

1:03:46.572 --> 1:03:48.658
