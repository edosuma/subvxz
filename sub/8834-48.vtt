[Baloo] We should have been in Aridia
over an hour ago, Wildcat.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.417
What's our position?

01:17.166 --> 01:19.166
Way high up in the air.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.917
Let me see that.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.083
Hey, you're reading the map upside down.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.166
We're flying in the wrong direction.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.625
No wonder we haven't seen any desert.

01:28.709 --> 01:32.208
We've got to get this tablet
to the museum by three.

01:32.291 --> 01:35.041
Because you'll never work in
this town if you don't?

01:35.125 --> 01:39.291
Nah, 'cause they'll probably
treat us like kings in Aridia.

01:39.375 --> 01:43.667
The red carpet treatment, dancing girls,
fabulous feasts... [giggling]

01:43.750 --> 01:45.834
And I don't want to be late for that.

01:49.959 --> 01:53.208
Either the sea duck is
late to its own ambush

01:53.291 --> 01:56.959
or we forget to change our
clocks to Aridian Standard Time.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.875
I cannot wait! I must have that tablet!

01:59.959 --> 02:03.625
You have a headache, sir?

02:03.709 --> 02:06.417
Not an aspirin tablet,

02:06.500 --> 02:08.458
the ancient stone tablet,

02:08.542 --> 02:11.500
which will lead me to the lost
treasure of King Utmost.

02:11.583 --> 02:15.667
How're you gonna read it if
it's in some funny language?

02:15.750 --> 02:20.875
With this.

[Baloo] Them mountain passes

Fire!

02:49.083 --> 02:51.458

02:51.542 --> 02:53.542
Why did we go stop?

02:53.625 --> 02:55.000
[whispering]

02:55.083 --> 02:57.125
What do you mean we are stuck?

02:59.208 --> 03:02.750
Keep your eyes peeled for any
welcoming parties, Wildcat.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.000
OK, Baloo.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.625
[tire squealing]

03:15.291 --> 03:18.125
Hey, is this the welcoming party?

03:18.208 --> 03:20.875
They must've got tired of waiting.

03:20.959 --> 03:24.542
I guess we'll have to carry
the stone to the museum.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.750
[Baloo panting]

03:27.834 --> 03:30.208
Hold it, Wildcat. Let's put 'er down.

03:30.291 --> 03:33.125
Whew. Does that thing seem heavy to you?

03:33.208 --> 03:34.375
No.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.166
[sighs] Well, let's keep going.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.291
-Ready?
-Ready.

03:38.375 --> 03:41.458
[grunting] It's tough going now,

03:41.542 --> 03:45.083
but we'll be waited on hand and foot
before you know it.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.542
"Coming soon. Museum of Ancient History."

03:49.625 --> 03:51.083
Shall we wait for it?

03:51.166 --> 03:53.417
Nah. Let's check next door.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.166
[Baloo panting]

04:03.250 --> 04:06.667
You brought the tablet. How wonderful.

04:06.750 --> 04:10.083
I'm Myra, state archaeologist,
Minister of Culture,

04:10.166 --> 04:12.834
and I'll be the museum curator, too,
when it opens.

04:12.917 --> 04:15.375
[straining] Pleased to meet you.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.709
Can I set this thing down somewhere?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.333
Just put it there.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.166
Ah, sorry, ma'am.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.583
I can't believe the table of King Utmost

04:29.667 --> 04:31.417
was discovered at a thrift shop.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.875
On sale too.

04:32.959 --> 04:34.959
This is a great discovery.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.125
We ought to be gettin' dinner about now.

04:37.208 --> 04:40.208
Well, goodbye, and thank you
for all your help.

04:40.291 --> 04:42.959
But-but-but... What about dinner?

04:43.041 --> 04:47.125
I'm sorry. I'll take you
for some of our local delicacies.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.083
Is it OK if we take the tablet?

04:49.166 --> 04:51.041
I can't wait to translate it.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.041
Allow me.

04:54.667 --> 04:57.125
I apologize for the long walk.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.166
Taxis are scarce in Aridia.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.375
That's OK. What I'm losing in strength

05:02.458 --> 05:04.542
I'm gaining in blisters.

05:04.625 --> 05:08.417
Hey, Baloo, I don't see any dancing girls.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.834
They're dancing in another country.

05:10.917 --> 05:15.041
I getting the feeling that Aridia
is not real big on night life.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.458
Sorry, ma'am.

05:18.542 --> 05:20.792
But Aridia does have a rich culture

05:20.875 --> 05:24.458
contained entirely within
the great pyramid of King Utmost.

05:24.542 --> 05:27.750
But the location of the pyramid
is a mystery

05:27.834 --> 05:30.291
and no one's ever been able to find it.

05:30.375 --> 05:31.959
How'd you know that?

05:32.041 --> 05:33.875
It says so on the menu.

05:33.959 --> 05:38.917
Unbelievable. The tablet shows
the location of the great pyramid.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.417
If I find the pyramid,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.125
I'll finally be able to build the museum

05:42.208 --> 05:43.834
and help Aridia's economy.

05:43.917 --> 05:46.875
Waiter. Three house specials, please.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.959
[ominous music playing]

05:52.041 --> 05:54.291
Well, at least we're gettin' a free meal.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.250
[dishes clattering]

06:04.875 --> 06:07.875
[swallows] That's it. We're gone.

06:07.959 --> 06:11.333
Almost forgot.
Got a dental appointment at five.

06:11.417 --> 06:13.667
Oh, well, thank you for all your help.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.834
Look, Baloo. The waiters are triplets.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.959
They're not waiters, Wildcat,

06:19.041 --> 06:20.875
they're pirates.

06:20.959 --> 06:21.917
Pirates!

06:23.041 --> 06:25.875
Hand over the tablet, flyboy.

06:25.959 --> 06:27.583
Sure thing.

06:37.542 --> 06:38.625
Give me that stone.

06:38.709 --> 06:41.291
You'll have to get past
me first, Dumptruck.

06:43.041 --> 06:43.959
[crashes]

06:44.333 --> 06:46.458
How about best two out of three?

06:55.667 --> 06:59.458
It will take more than a chair to stop me.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.000
He was right.

07:14.375 --> 07:17.291
That's pretty fancy footwork, Wildcat.

07:17.375 --> 07:20.166
Thank you. I'm slippin'.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.667
Well, ma'am, I guess we'll be off.

07:23.750 --> 07:28.667
Before you go, can you make
sense of these coordinates?

07:28.750 --> 07:29.750
Please.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.834
[Baloo] This is it.

07:32.917 --> 07:35.333
Those coordinates point right here.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.709
But this is the airport.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.333
I just don't understand.

07:39.417 --> 07:43.208
[Baloo] I'm really sorry, ma'am.
I know I read the tablet right.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.917
Maybe there just isn't any pyramid.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.291
But, Baloo, the tablet says
the pyramid's right here.

07:50.375 --> 07:54.333
Wildcat, you're reading
things backwards again.

07:54.417 --> 07:58.333
If the pyramid was right here,
we'd be standing on it.

07:58.417 --> 07:59.500
[gulping]

08:03.291 --> 08:05.542
[Baloo] Any sign of pirates, Myra?

08:05.625 --> 08:07.709
The coast is clear, Baloo.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.667
[grunting]

08:16.959 --> 08:20.542
Is there anything in the tablet
about a password?

08:20.625 --> 08:21.834
Not that I could see.

08:22.959 --> 08:24.667
Hey! Wildcat!

08:24.750 --> 08:27.000
Whoa-whoooa!

08:27.083 --> 08:29.709
Baloo! Are you OK?

08:29.792 --> 08:31.917
[Baloo] Watch that first step...

08:32.000 --> 08:33.291
It's a lulu!

[wind blowing]

08:35.582 --> 08:38.082
[playful music playing]

08:43.457 --> 08:47.250
If the pyramid will not come to Karnage,

08:47.333 --> 08:50.417
Karnage will come to the pyramid.

08:51.375 --> 08:54.333
[tense music playing]

08:57.333 --> 08:59.583
Wildcat! Where are you?

08:59.667 --> 09:01.333
Down here, Baloo.

09:01.417 --> 09:04.000
What are you doing upside down?

09:04.083 --> 09:05.959
Wildcat, get down here.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.875
You can't walk on the ceiling.

09:07.959 --> 09:09.625
I can't?

09:10.291 --> 09:11.208
[crashes]

09:11.667 --> 09:13.458
This is amazing.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.250
They built everything upside down.

09:15.333 --> 09:18.917
Even the statues are bolted
to the ceiling-- [stammers] floor.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.250
Why would anyone want to build
an upside-down pyramid?

09:23.333 --> 09:25.792
Maybe they all walked on their hands.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.875
[chuckles] Maybe they all thought
like you, Wildcat.

09:28.959 --> 09:33.125
Be careful. The ancient pyramids
are rife with secret traps.

09:33.208 --> 09:36.875
But who'd be crazy enough to
put a trap on the ceiling?

09:38.208 --> 09:39.709
[all screaming]

09:48.333 --> 09:50.834
Look, an inscription.

09:50.917 --> 09:52.750
But it's upside down.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.083
Why am I not surprised?

09:55.166 --> 09:59.291
It says "Beware of mummy.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.959
Keep reading for further details."

10:02.041 --> 10:05.333
A mummy? [laughs]
Boa constrictors I'm afraid of,

10:05.417 --> 10:07.500
but mummies? [laughing]

[mummy growling]

[mummy growling]

10:15.208 --> 10:16.792
Hey, who's the mummy?

10:23.000 --> 10:26.583
Oh, great! We had to pick a room
with high ceilings.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.709
[mummy growling]

10:28.792 --> 10:30.083
Quick! Up that column!

10:37.625 --> 10:40.083
What did you do to make him mad, Baloo?

10:40.166 --> 10:41.834
Nothing. He must've got up

10:41.917 --> 10:44.583
on the wrong side
of the sarcophagus this morning.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.250
Come on, Baloo!

10:57.041 --> 10:59.250
[grunting]

11:01.375 --> 11:03.166
My turn to ride him. I'll be next.

11:03.250 --> 11:04.625
Try not to damage him, Baloo.

11:04.709 --> 11:06.792
He's a historical artifact.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.625
I'm gonna be one too in a minute.

11:09.709 --> 11:10.834
We've got to do something.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.750
All I could find was this accordion.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.375
That's not an accordion. It's a ladder.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.125
Here, Baloo!

So, uh, you come here often?

11:34.875 --> 11:37.959

when he gets to my end.

11:39.875 --> 11:43.083
[mummy growls]

11:50.834 --> 11:53.083
That'd stop a two-ton truck.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.792
Wow! He must get a lot of exercise.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.500
So will we running out of here.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.917
Look what dropped in for a visit.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.291
Look, I really love our little chats,

12:18.542 --> 12:20.333
but there's this crazed mummy after us.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.917
Do you think I am stupid in the head?

You cannot frighten me away
with silliness about a mummy.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.792
Come on, this way!

12:33.250 --> 12:36.792
This cheap mummy costume
does not fool me.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.959
Now stand aside

12:39.041 --> 12:41.208
or you will need a new band-aid.

12:42.667 --> 12:47.166
[nervous laugh] Nice suit
and what a fit. I tell you this...

12:47.250 --> 12:49.291
You let me take the treasure

12:49.375 --> 12:51.834
and I split it with you 50-50. Yes-no?

12:51.917 --> 12:52.792
[growls]

12:53.834 --> 12:55.250
-[whispers]
-Good idea.

12:55.375 --> 12:59.458
OK, 60-40, but that is my final offer.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.125
[mummy growling]

13:01.208 --> 13:05.041
OK. You asked for it. Get him!

13:05.625 --> 13:07.959
I was afraid he'd say that.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.291
[mummy growling]

13:13.792 --> 13:16.625
Ah-ha. The way out.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.750
Say, this looks familiar.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.959
[Myra] I can finish
reading the inscription

13:29.041 --> 13:31.583
if i can just get a good angle on it.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.166
[Baloo] Oh, let's go, Myra.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.709
Our mummy pal could drop by any second.

13:35.792 --> 13:39.875
But the hieroglyphics might tell
us how to get rid of the mummy.

13:39.959 --> 13:42.542
All right, you twisted my arm.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.458
[whispers]

13:47.959 --> 13:51.417
There must be a easier way
to pillage this pyramid.

13:51.542 --> 13:52.834
[continues whispering]

13:52.959 --> 13:54.959
Excellent!

13:55.041 --> 13:58.291
Radio the island vulture and
tell them to bring the cables,

13:58.375 --> 14:00.083
the big, fat ones like this.

14:00.166 --> 14:05.375
[Myra] Hmm, seems the mummy
was the foreman who built the pyramid.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.333
He read the blueprint wrong

14:07.417 --> 14:09.792
and built the pyramid upside down.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.750
What a great idea.

14:11.834 --> 14:14.875
Yeah, he was probably an ancestor
of yours, Wildcat.

14:14.959 --> 14:17.667
"King Utmost was so embarrassed

14:17.750 --> 14:20.291
he put a curse on the foreman

14:20.375 --> 14:22.458
and condemned him to stop anyone

14:22.542 --> 14:25.500
who stumbled onto the shameful secret."

14:27.750 --> 14:31.083
Can we skip to the part about
gettin' rid of the mummy?

14:31.166 --> 14:33.917
Ah-ha. "To lift the mummy's curse,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.166
the pyramid must be turned right side up."

14:36.250 --> 14:38.166
Is that all?

14:38.792 --> 14:40.417
[mummy growling]

14:40.500 --> 14:42.291
Where do we start lifting?

14:48.041 --> 14:50.166
Way to go, Wildcat!

14:50.250 --> 14:51.333
[mummy growling]

14:51.417 --> 14:52.834
Come on. This way.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.917
No. This way.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.959
Why didn't you tell us
you knew the way out?

14:58.041 --> 14:59.208
You didn't ask.

15:01.458 --> 15:02.500
I'm worried, Baloo.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.542
We can't just leave those pirates in here.

15:04.625 --> 15:08.041
What are they gonna do?
Take the whole pyramid?

15:09.208 --> 15:10.875
What's going on?!

15:10.959 --> 15:13.291
They're taking the whole enchilada.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.417
Come on! We got to get
to the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

15:23.917 --> 15:26.166
Uh-oh, handsome's back.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.875
[laughing] The lost treasure is mine!

15:36.375 --> 15:37.959
[shouting]

15:41.250 --> 15:43.083
[screaming]

15:44.333 --> 15:45.750
Poor mummy.

15:45.834 --> 15:48.000
How about poor us? Let's get out of here!

15:48.083 --> 15:50.417
[Myra] But we have to save the pyramid.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.583
Right.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.500
Now, listen here, Karnage,

15:58.583 --> 16:01.166
put down that pyramid or else.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.208
[Don Karnage] <i>Or else what, future victim?</i>

16:04.291 --> 16:06.709
Anyone got any ideas?

16:06.792 --> 16:08.792
-No.
-Not me.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.208
[Baloo stuttering]
Ah, let me get back to you.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.583
Uh-oh.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.625
All I asked for was a couple of
dancing girls and a free meal.

16:18.709 --> 16:20.583
Instead, I've been jumped by pirates,

16:20.667 --> 16:22.375
chased by a crazed mummy,

16:22.458 --> 16:24.709
lost inside an upside down pyramid

16:24.792 --> 16:26.709
and now I'm being shot at.

16:26.792 --> 16:29.125
[Wildcat] Yeah, I'm having
a great time, too.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.166
Thanks for bringing me along, Baloo.

16:31.250 --> 16:34.000
At least we should be safe
back here for a while.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.250
[whispers]

16:36.375 --> 16:39.959
Oh, those silly, foolish types.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.000
Think they can out fox the fox

16:42.083 --> 16:44.834
by hiding behind his backside, eh?

16:44.917 --> 16:46.458
[whispering]

16:46.542 --> 16:47.417
Yes, yes, yes.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.458
Bring out the great big gun that
makes the loud kaboom-boom.

16:52.542 --> 16:55.417
Oh, looks like we've got some fireworks.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.750
Baloo, what's big and round
and made of black metal

16:58.834 --> 17:00.500
and hollow in the middle?

17:00.583 --> 17:03.667
I haven't got time
for riddles right now, Wildcat,

17:03.750 --> 17:05.541
I've got an emergency down here.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.541
This is really important, Baloo.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.040
All right, I give up. What?

17:10.125 --> 17:11.791
-That.
-Whooa!

17:13.290 --> 17:15.125
We'll be safe down here.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.916
[mummy growls]

17:17.666 --> 17:20.541
How about if we toast those cables?

17:20.625 --> 17:22.959
Now you're thinking right side up,
Wildcat.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.625
And when we're done, we can
toast some marshmallows.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.417
How's it going out there, Wildcat?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.583
I think I singed one.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.083
Well, keep going.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.875
[mummy growling]

17:43.542 --> 17:45.792
Hey, where'd the flame go?

17:45.875 --> 17:48.125
Hey, where's Wildcat?

17:48.208 --> 17:50.291
I'm really starting to get upset.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.417
That pirate's stealing my life's work

17:52.500 --> 17:54.291
and ruining the future of my country.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.583
What could be worse?

17:55.667 --> 17:56.917
[mummy growling]

17:57.000 --> 17:57.917
Look out!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.250
Does anybody ever knock?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.375
[whispers]

18:05.500 --> 18:07.458
The <i>Sea Duck </i> has returned.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.375
Fire at will!

18:09.625 --> 18:11.500
[screaming]

18:12.041 --> 18:13.542
[shooting]

18:13.625 --> 18:16.750
No. Do not fire at will.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.333
He is my second mate.

18:19.417 --> 18:20.917
Fire at the <i>Sea Duck!</i>

18:26.959 --> 18:28.542
Here we go again!

18:33.250 --> 18:37.458
It might be safer to take our
chances with laughing boy here.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.792
On second thought, I could be wrong.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.542
Will you knock it off?!

18:42.000 --> 18:43.417
[whimpers]

18:43.542 --> 18:45.125
What is your problem?

18:45.208 --> 18:48.083
It's not our fault you built
the lousy pyramid upside down.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.959
We didn't put the curse on you!

18:51.500 --> 18:53.750
We're trying to help you.

18:53.834 --> 18:56.750
You can stomp around all day
growling like an idiot,

18:56.834 --> 18:58.792
or you can give us a hand.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.333
[whimpers]

19:00.792 --> 19:03.792
Now look, that pirate's
stealing the pyramid.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.792
Are you going
to let him get away with that?

19:05.875 --> 19:08.000
Uh-uh.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.583
Then get out there and do your thing.

19:10.959 --> 19:12.500
[growling]

19:24.583 --> 19:27.417
Hey, what are you doing on the pyramid?

19:29.250 --> 19:31.417
[Baloo] If he plays his cards right,

19:31.500 --> 19:33.792
He might just put an end
to that curse.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.875
This is the way out.

19:35.959 --> 19:37.458
Ooh, we made it.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.375
Hang on!

19:44.583 --> 19:47.125
[both screaming]

19:50.250 --> 19:53.417
What is happening to our posterior
back end back there?

19:53.583 --> 19:55.041
[whispering]

19:55.333 --> 19:58.959
Then turn the rear engines
on full throttle.

20:01.542 --> 20:06.792
Are the rear engines still
on full throttle?

20:06.959 --> 20:09.083
[whispering]

20:09.667 --> 20:11.375
I was afraid so.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.500
Where she stops nobody knows.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.125
But where's that mummy?

20:25.917 --> 20:27.291
[excited murmuring]

20:27.458 --> 20:31.208
Looks like he's gettin' some
well-deserved shut-eye.

20:31.291 --> 20:33.000
He's our star attraction.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.625
We'll even take in enough
to build a new airport.

20:35.709 --> 20:38.000
And... what else?

20:38.083 --> 20:40.458
And a nice red carpet

20:40.542 --> 20:43.083
and some dancing girls.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.834
Solid.

20:46.917 --> 20:49.583
Wildcat, what are you doing?

20:49.667 --> 20:52.083
I like the place better this way.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.625
And they say if you listen closely,

20:54.709 --> 20:57.375
you can hear the voice of the pharaohs.

20:57.458 --> 21:00.208
Captain, are you in here?

21:00.291 --> 21:02.583
Please answer me!

21:02.667 --> 21:06.667
Captain, where are you?

21:06.834 --> 21:08.250
[Dumptruck] Maybe he died.
