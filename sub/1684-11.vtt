WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.400
<i>Previously on</i> Sleepy Hollow...

00:01.435 --> 00:03.385
Our quest will not be without peril.

00:03.485 --> 00:05.466
Crane, you and I can't
have lunch without peril.

00:05.511 --> 00:07.412
CRANE: <i> There is the
legend of Methuselah...</i>

00:07.513 --> 00:08.413
He was given a sword

00:08.447 --> 00:09.380
<i>with the power to kill</i>

00:09.381 --> 00:11.316
<i>any being on Earth.</i>

00:11.417 --> 00:13.484
<i>He used it to take down
a thousand demons.</i>

00:13.585 --> 00:15.005
The Sword can kill Moloch.

00:15.587 --> 00:16.688
The time has come.

00:16.789 --> 00:18.790
<i>The trumpet has signaled</i>

00:18.891 --> 00:20.858
<i>the starting of war.</i>

00:20.959 --> 00:22.994
Moloch shall not rise.

00:23.095 --> 00:25.429
(horse neighs)

00:28.934 --> 00:30.935
(thunder crashing)

00:32.104 --> 00:33.938
CRANE: According to this
map, the Fredericks Manor

00:34.039 --> 00:35.039
is approximately...

00:35.140 --> 00:36.140
Exactly 6.2 miles away.

00:36.141 --> 00:37.208
I told you, I have GPS.

00:37.309 --> 00:38.276
Forgive me for not

00:38.377 --> 00:39.711
trusting an electronic device

00:39.812 --> 00:41.346
during an apocalyptic storm.

00:41.447 --> 00:43.014
Really think this is it?

00:43.115 --> 00:45.349
End of Days.

00:46.618 --> 00:47.986
Moloch has risen.

00:48.087 --> 00:49.654
He sounded the trumpet.

00:49.755 --> 00:53.358
Very little remains between
now and his earthly reign.

00:53.459 --> 00:55.226
There's Katrina, us...

00:55.327 --> 00:56.628
and a Sword.

00:56.729 --> 00:58.830
That is assuming she can

00:58.931 --> 01:00.632
hold him off until we arrive.

01:00.733 --> 01:02.300
(thunder crashes)

01:02.401 --> 01:03.901
<i>If the End is upon us,</i>

01:04.001 --> 01:06.237
his use for her has likely passed.

01:06.338 --> 01:08.973
Well, we just need a few more minutes.

01:11.276 --> 01:13.577
(engine stalls, GPS blips out)

01:15.114 --> 01:16.347
No...

01:16.448 --> 01:19.150
<i>No! Come on!</i>

01:20.519 --> 01:22.059
Oh, come on!

01:24.857 --> 01:26.157
The problem is electrical.

01:26.258 --> 01:27.892
Ignition module failure,

01:27.993 --> 01:29.861
most likely from a surge.

01:29.962 --> 01:31.429
How long will it take to redress?

01:31.530 --> 01:32.764
Repair?

01:32.865 --> 01:34.525
ABBIE: Mm-hmm. Not long. About an hour,

01:34.602 --> 01:35.582
once I have the parts.

01:35.665 --> 01:36.701
You don't have them here?

01:36.702 --> 01:38.670
- No.
- Sir... you must understand

01:38.771 --> 01:40.004
our situation is dire.

01:40.105 --> 01:41.506
We must have conveyance

01:41.607 --> 01:43.341
immediately.

01:44.043 --> 01:45.276
I'll call a cab.

01:45.377 --> 01:46.511
MECHANIC: Whoa!

01:46.612 --> 01:49.280
We've got to get over there, Crane.

01:49.381 --> 01:50.915
(mutters)

01:53.452 --> 01:55.019
Lieutenant...

01:56.622 --> 01:58.089
A motorcycle.

01:58.190 --> 02:01.626
No electronics, just good
old-fashioned machinery.

02:01.727 --> 02:04.796
If ever there were justification
to commandeer a vehicle...

02:04.897 --> 02:07.098
the Apocalypse would be it.

02:07.199 --> 02:08.765
Grab the Sword.

02:14.006 --> 02:16.040
Okay, Crane...

02:16.141 --> 02:17.609
hop on and hold on.

02:17.710 --> 02:19.250
Right.

02:20.245 --> 02:21.412
Where do I buckle?

02:21.513 --> 02:22.780
Arms around me.

02:22.881 --> 02:23.915
Right. Of course.

02:24.016 --> 02:25.116
But where do I buckle?

02:25.217 --> 02:26.868
No buckle. Normally, you wear a helmet,

02:26.869 --> 02:28.886
but again, you get a bye
when it's the End of Days.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.347
Perhaps there's a stable nearby...

02:30.356 --> 02:31.589
(engine starts)

02:31.690 --> 02:33.458
Don't worry...

02:33.559 --> 02:35.159
I had a bike when I was a teenager.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.562
(engine revs)

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.412 --> 02:55.413
I want one of these.

02:55.514 --> 02:57.882
As soon as this is over.

03:00.286 --> 03:02.854
ABBIE: There's no noise,
no light on inside.

03:02.955 --> 03:04.856
You think they're still here?

03:04.957 --> 03:07.158
We forge ahead.

03:07.259 --> 03:08.960
Katrina last contacted us from here.

03:09.061 --> 03:11.830
Let's go.

03:11.931 --> 03:14.711
Got to be ready for anything.

03:18.404 --> 03:20.705
(door creaking)

03:49.134 --> 03:51.536
Clear.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.145
The place is abandoned.

04:00.246 --> 04:04.048
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

04:04.149 --> 04:08.419
Hard to know what to make of
the remnants they left behind.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.780
There must be a reason for this model.

04:11.757 --> 04:16.060
Details... and these flags...

04:16.161 --> 04:19.329
These are locations
that Henry has struck.

04:19.430 --> 04:21.265
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

04:26.038 --> 04:27.839
St. Henry's Parish...

04:29.041 --> 04:31.176
That's the carriage house...

04:31.277 --> 04:32.010
To me, to me, to me...

04:32.111 --> 04:34.312
The flower shop...

04:35.014 --> 04:37.348
Tarrytown Psychiatric...

04:38.284 --> 04:40.985
Fredericks Manor...

04:46.292 --> 04:48.860
Son of a bitch.

04:50.863 --> 04:53.264
It's a pentagram over the city.

04:53.365 --> 04:56.033
We saw one just like it in Moloch's lair.

05:00.639 --> 05:03.208
Washington's Bible...

05:03.309 --> 05:04.909
states that the start of the Apocalypse

05:04.910 --> 05:07.278
will see a demon create hell on Earth.

05:07.379 --> 05:08.780
We stopped Moloch the first time

05:08.881 --> 05:10.301
he tried to raise his demon army,

05:10.382 --> 05:12.050
but this pentagram may
let the rest of them in.

05:12.151 --> 05:14.452
But where is Moloch now?

05:14.553 --> 05:17.488
Katrina came to this place to kill him.

05:20.326 --> 05:21.926
Are we too late?

05:22.027 --> 05:23.428
KATRINA: No, please... aah!

05:23.529 --> 05:24.429
Katrina...

05:24.530 --> 05:25.997
(thunder crashes)

05:30.169 --> 05:31.236
The Binding Ritual.

05:31.337 --> 05:33.371
(sobbing): No!

05:35.074 --> 05:37.454
CRANE: He's going to
make Katrina his bride.

05:37.777 --> 05:40.745
Not if we stop him first.

05:40.846 --> 05:42.247
You're got the Sword...

05:42.348 --> 05:44.582
go get him, Crane!

06:16.048 --> 06:18.416
(thunder rumbling)

06:26.792 --> 06:30.628
Tell me where Moloch
is or you will die.

07:03.233 --> 07:07.941
Subtitle sync and corrections by
awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.561
(thunder crashes)

07:11.662 --> 07:15.766
One flinch, and this sword will
pierce your shell of a heart.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.168
Katrina...

07:18.269 --> 07:21.038
can you still see this
creature as Abraham?

07:21.139 --> 07:23.373
As long as I'm wearing this amulet, yes.

07:23.474 --> 07:25.842
I'm going to ask him some
very simple questions.

07:25.943 --> 07:29.112
I may have a way of extending
the amulet's enchantment...

07:29.213 --> 07:31.748
so you may see him for yourself.

07:33.951 --> 07:35.185
<i>Extendes venustas monile...</i>

07:35.286 --> 07:37.421
<i>extendes venustas monile...</i>

07:37.522 --> 07:39.590
<i>Extendes monile...</i>

07:39.691 --> 07:41.658
(eerie whoosh)

07:47.799 --> 07:49.599
Abraham.

07:51.235 --> 07:54.872
This sword can slay any
solider in Evil's Army...

07:54.973 --> 07:57.708
the Horseman of Death is no exception.

07:57.809 --> 07:59.943
Yes, the Sword of Methuselah...

08:00.044 --> 08:02.980
a sword of infinite,
unstoppable power to man.

08:03.081 --> 08:06.016
Does nothing seem strange
about that tale to you?

08:07.385 --> 08:09.887
All magic has a cost.

08:09.988 --> 08:11.989
What are you saying?

08:12.090 --> 08:15.058
The Sword requires a sacrifice...

08:15.159 --> 08:18.228
the life of anybody who wields it.

08:18.329 --> 08:19.630
You're lying.

08:19.731 --> 08:22.132
The moment a man uses the Sword to kill,

08:22.233 --> 08:24.268
his soul, and hence, his life

08:24.369 --> 08:25.602
will be taken with it.

08:25.703 --> 08:27.737
Enough deceit!

08:29.707 --> 08:31.675
We have an apocalypse to halt.

08:32.277 --> 08:34.010
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:34.111 --> 08:36.113
The runes on the Sword's hilt...

08:36.214 --> 08:37.474
they reference Erelim angels,

08:37.515 --> 08:39.183
agents of earthly justice.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.251
Abraham may be telling the truth.

08:41.352 --> 08:42.376
ABBIE: You cannot be serious.

08:42.477 --> 08:43.854
Using the Sword will kill us?

08:43.955 --> 08:45.255
I need time

08:45.356 --> 08:48.091
to prove or disprove
Abraham's assertion.

08:48.192 --> 08:50.812
We don't have time... that's
why he's trying to stall us.

08:55.934 --> 09:00.337
(thunder crashing, rumbling)

09:00.438 --> 09:02.565
My mother and my ancestors

09:02.666 --> 09:04.284
spent their lives
looking for this sword.

09:04.285 --> 09:05.912
If it turns out that we
can't even use it...?

09:06.013 --> 09:08.348
Let's not hasten to conclusions.

09:08.449 --> 09:09.749
Miss Jenny will arrive shortly

09:09.785 --> 09:11.652
with the research that
Katrina requested.

09:11.753 --> 09:13.254
Assuming that she can find some

09:13.355 --> 09:16.657
obscure, lost chapter from
the Alexandrian Canon.

09:16.758 --> 09:18.359
(sighs) Yes, well, until then,

09:18.460 --> 09:20.828
it is up to Katrina to
gather more intelligence.

09:24.499 --> 09:26.334
I know this isn't easy for you,

09:26.435 --> 09:28.269
seeing her with him.

09:28.370 --> 09:31.606
Abraham knows we cannot use the Sword.

09:31.707 --> 09:34.308
Katrina must take a
more personal approach.

09:35.777 --> 09:37.557
ABBIE: <i>And...?</i>

09:42.484 --> 09:44.185
(sighs)

09:44.286 --> 09:47.021
Our marriage has been under
a lot of strain of late.

09:47.122 --> 09:49.023
And now she's saved Abraham's life.

09:49.124 --> 09:50.391
Only to save mine.

09:50.492 --> 09:53.160
I know.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.535
I should hang the risk and kill him.

10:00.636 --> 10:02.270
(scoffs)

10:02.371 --> 10:03.782
Leave me with this mess all on my own?

10:03.883 --> 10:06.140
No. No.

10:06.241 --> 10:07.661
You're not getting off that easy.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.143
- (phone buzzing)
- Oh...

10:09.244 --> 10:12.213
That's Jenny. Let's move.

10:17.319 --> 10:20.154
JENNY: <i> I found the chapter</i>
<i>Katrina told us to look up.</i>

10:20.255 --> 10:24.459
"God wrote the Ineffable Name
upon Methuselah's Sword.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.562
For man to wield it would
consume his soul in fire."

10:29.431 --> 10:32.566
Abraham was speaking the truth.

10:34.736 --> 10:35.903
Such a strange

10:36.004 --> 10:38.506
and singular weapon.

10:38.607 --> 10:42.243
Exacting the cost of death for death.

10:42.344 --> 10:43.945
It could take both of us to finish this.

10:43.946 --> 10:45.646
Crane?

10:45.747 --> 10:49.150
We die... for the cause.

10:49.251 --> 10:51.352
Maybe it's our job as Witnesses.

10:51.453 --> 10:53.488
How so?

10:53.589 --> 10:55.623
My guess is that when we find Moloch,

10:55.724 --> 10:57.492
the Horseman of War will
be standing beside him.

10:57.593 --> 10:59.460
Two demons.

10:59.561 --> 11:01.429
Two of us.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.698
- Perhaps.
- Crane?

11:03.799 --> 11:05.539
I need to know that if
your son interferes

11:05.567 --> 11:06.968
with us killing Moloch, you'll be able

11:07.069 --> 11:09.771
to use this sword against him.

11:09.872 --> 11:12.006
You must be able to kill Henry.

11:12.107 --> 11:14.175
Moloch is our target.

11:14.276 --> 11:16.544
Everything else is secondary.

11:16.645 --> 11:18.880
Moloch knows that your
family is your weakness.

11:18.981 --> 11:21.783
I will lay down my soul
to stop this apocalypse.

11:21.884 --> 11:23.851
But are you willing to
lay down your son's?

11:23.952 --> 11:26.054
Guys, what if there's another way?

11:26.155 --> 11:27.789
Jenny, you're not carrying the Sword.

11:27.890 --> 11:29.257
That's not what I was gonna pitch.

11:29.258 --> 11:30.691
But thanks for thinking of me.

11:30.792 --> 11:32.660
From what I can gather,

11:32.761 --> 11:34.062
the moment you kill someone,

11:34.163 --> 11:36.964
- the Sword consumes your soul.
- So it says.

11:37.065 --> 11:39.900
What if your soul has
already been claimed?

11:41.136 --> 11:44.438
Then the Sword would be
unable to consume it.

11:45.107 --> 11:46.407
Irving.

11:46.508 --> 11:47.742
Henry owns his soul.

11:47.843 --> 11:49.063
Maybe he can wield the Sword

11:49.077 --> 11:49.977
without dying.

11:50.078 --> 11:51.068
Or it will kill him

11:51.169 --> 11:52.580
and then Henry takes over his soul.

11:52.581 --> 11:55.083
He has a wife, daughter, a family.

11:55.184 --> 11:57.018
We don't even know where he is.

11:57.119 --> 11:59.153
He left last night. He
couldn't have gotten far.

11:59.254 --> 12:00.655
Abbie, if there's a chance

12:00.756 --> 12:02.423
no one has to die to win this war,

12:02.524 --> 12:05.326
we have to try.

12:11.099 --> 12:13.067
(Moloch roars)

12:14.136 --> 12:16.838
PARISH: This is our genesis.

12:16.939 --> 12:20.241
The very spot where you
pulled me out of the ground.

12:21.043 --> 12:23.244
(chanting in ancient language)

12:25.547 --> 12:28.282
My true birthplace.

12:28.383 --> 12:31.386
Where you became my new father.

12:31.487 --> 12:33.955
Together...

12:34.056 --> 12:36.290
we will raise hell on Earth.

12:38.894 --> 12:40.762
Rise, purgatory.

12:40.863 --> 12:43.164
Come and see.

12:54.676 --> 12:56.411
Abraham, please.

12:56.512 --> 12:58.880
Moloch did not save your life. I did.

12:58.981 --> 13:00.481
You have no reason to protect him.

13:00.582 --> 13:01.983
Spare me, witch.

13:02.084 --> 13:03.951
You were never anything
more than a spy.

13:04.052 --> 13:05.286
That is not true.

13:06.522 --> 13:08.890
I had such plans for us.

13:08.991 --> 13:11.159
A binding ritual is no future.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.960
A last resort.

13:13.061 --> 13:14.896
I fought for you, and in return

13:14.997 --> 13:17.632
you tried to deceive and destroy me.

13:17.733 --> 13:20.101
Not to destroy you.

13:20.202 --> 13:22.303
Moloch.

13:22.404 --> 13:24.806
Yes, I was a spy.

13:24.907 --> 13:26.941
I stayed with you to gather intelligence.

13:27.042 --> 13:28.176
But...

13:28.277 --> 13:31.913
while I was with you...

13:32.014 --> 13:35.750
I saw the real you, Abraham.

13:35.851 --> 13:38.853
I saw a man I haven't seen in centuries.

13:42.057 --> 13:44.892
I saw how deeply you cared for me.

13:46.762 --> 13:49.363
And I care for you, too.

13:51.266 --> 13:53.367
(door slams)

13:54.870 --> 13:56.004
Ichabod!

13:56.105 --> 13:59.674
I require your counsel.

13:59.775 --> 14:03.444
Our friend, Captain Irving?
His soul belongs to Henry.

14:03.545 --> 14:05.446
Do you think he might be able

14:05.547 --> 14:07.682
to wield the Sword with impunity?

14:07.783 --> 14:09.484
Captain Irving? Uh...

14:09.585 --> 14:11.653
Yes, I believe so.

14:11.754 --> 14:14.022
No being nor sword
can lay claim on a soul

14:14.123 --> 14:16.057
that has already been given.

14:16.158 --> 14:19.627
In that case, we shall
endeavor to retrieve him.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.329
Maybe I should stay here

14:21.430 --> 14:23.798
and guard Abraham.

14:23.899 --> 14:25.199
I think I may be getting closer to him

14:25.300 --> 14:26.634
telling us what he knows.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.202
Of course.

14:29.972 --> 14:31.306
Very well, then.

14:31.407 --> 14:32.473
I am sorry...

14:32.574 --> 14:34.509
for going back to Fredericks Manor

14:34.610 --> 14:35.830
without a proper farewell...

14:35.877 --> 14:37.178
I trusted your judgment.

14:37.279 --> 14:39.914
I hope you still do.

14:40.983 --> 14:43.918
Tell me this.

14:44.019 --> 14:46.588
If Henry stood in the
path of defeating Moloch,

14:46.689 --> 14:50.424
would you be able to kill Henry?

14:51.527 --> 14:54.395
Moloch is the enemy.

14:54.496 --> 14:56.464
Not our son.

14:57.866 --> 14:59.567
If we slay that beast, Henry's soul

14:59.668 --> 15:01.502
will be released from Moloch's hold.

15:01.603 --> 15:04.383
In the heat of battle we may
not have the opportunity.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.075
There may be no other way.

15:07.176 --> 15:10.911
My love, there's always another way.

15:31.878 --> 15:34.179
Have you discovered anything
new about the Sword?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.381
Yeah, in the Alexandrian
version of the Bible,

15:36.482 --> 15:37.883
there's a reference in Genesis.

15:37.984 --> 15:40.952
Adjacent to the story
of Abraham and Isaac.

15:41.053 --> 15:43.488
An unnerving test of faith.

15:43.589 --> 15:46.458
Asking a father to sacrifice his son.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.393
It's not the same, Crane.

15:48.494 --> 15:50.963
Isaac was an innocent

15:51.064 --> 15:53.198
child. Henry is...

15:53.299 --> 15:55.200
Will die by my hand...

15:55.301 --> 15:57.069
if necessary.

15:57.170 --> 16:00.005
But do grant me the
concession, Lieutenant.

16:00.106 --> 16:02.174
It is an unreasonable request.

16:02.275 --> 16:05.143
My mother had to sacrifice herself

16:05.244 --> 16:08.013
to protect me from Moloch.

16:08.114 --> 16:09.748
(thunder crashes)

16:09.849 --> 16:12.484
Nothing that we've come
across has been reasonable.

16:12.585 --> 16:14.052
JENNY: Guys, listen to this.

16:14.153 --> 16:17.196
It's Irving's message to me.

16:17.297 --> 16:18.757
IRVING: Sorry, Jenny.
Thank you for trying.

16:18.858 --> 16:20.826
But I can't run and hide.

16:20.927 --> 16:22.561
Not who I am. I'm gonna fight...

16:22.662 --> 16:23.895
(fast forwarding tape)

16:23.996 --> 16:25.397
Signing off at nine, 23,

16:25.498 --> 16:28.066
17, eight, zero.

16:29.368 --> 16:31.336
"Nine, 23."

16:31.437 --> 16:33.839
Clearly he's leaving us a code.

16:33.940 --> 16:35.674
Some way to reach him?
A time or a date?

16:35.775 --> 16:38.109
Maybe? September 23?

16:38.845 --> 16:42.014
September 23, 1780.

16:42.115 --> 16:44.895
I think he left this one for you.

16:46.953 --> 16:49.421
On this day, three patriots

16:49.522 --> 16:51.690
captured the British spy John Andre.

16:51.791 --> 16:53.292
Andre was arrested and immediately

16:53.393 --> 16:57.029
taken to a garrison in Sleepy Hollow.

16:57.130 --> 16:58.797
"Stay underground."

16:59.966 --> 17:01.419
The old military post is downtown.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.058
Just around the corner from the tunnels.

17:03.059 --> 17:04.936
Miss Jenny and I

17:05.038 --> 17:06.570
shall investigate.

17:06.672 --> 17:08.406
If you could go

17:08.508 --> 17:12.277
to Katrina and Abraham.

17:12.377 --> 17:14.713
We'll find him and bring him back.

17:14.814 --> 17:17.249
(door creaks open)

17:17.349 --> 17:19.651
(thunder crashing)

17:21.820 --> 17:25.390
The military post is right above us.

17:31.698 --> 17:33.164
Whoa! Halt!

17:36.769 --> 17:39.738
Trip wire.

17:46.279 --> 17:48.447
(shotgun cocks nearby)

17:48.548 --> 17:50.282
- Hands up!
- CRANE: Captain?

17:50.383 --> 17:52.818
It's us.

17:52.919 --> 17:54.653
We need you, Frank.

17:57.790 --> 18:00.225
This is it, isn't it?

18:01.794 --> 18:03.629
It appears we can use

18:03.730 --> 18:05.764
Henry's curse to our advantage.

18:05.865 --> 18:08.533
Because he has claimed your soul,

18:08.634 --> 18:09.935
the Sword cannot.

18:10.036 --> 18:11.270
You're the only one of us who can use

18:11.371 --> 18:12.791
the Sword without it killing you.

18:12.872 --> 18:16.608
What if you're wrong?

18:16.709 --> 18:19.011
What if I wield the
Sword, and it kills me?

18:19.112 --> 18:20.545
Then I die.

18:20.646 --> 18:22.514
And Henry claims my soul.

18:22.615 --> 18:24.449
Two very bad things.

18:24.550 --> 18:27.886
If we do nothing, we all die and...

18:27.987 --> 18:31.222
you rise by Henry's side all the same.

18:37.497 --> 18:40.132
Before I do this...

18:40.233 --> 18:42.401
I need to see Cynthia and Macey.

18:42.502 --> 18:44.636
There's no time. I wish there was.

18:44.737 --> 18:46.572
But I'll talk to Cynthia and Macey.

18:46.673 --> 18:47.973
You'll do more than that.

18:48.074 --> 18:49.808
You'll promise me

18:49.909 --> 18:52.744
you'll look after them.

18:52.845 --> 18:55.180
Yes. Of course.

18:55.281 --> 18:58.817
You have our word.

19:13.099 --> 19:15.400
Let's go see the Horseman.

19:19.605 --> 19:22.574
Abraham Van Brunt.

19:22.675 --> 19:25.177
I never thought we'd see each
other again, but here we are.

19:25.278 --> 19:28.747
Face to face.

19:28.848 --> 19:31.283
So... are you ready

19:31.384 --> 19:32.951
to tell us about Moloch?

19:33.052 --> 19:34.953
Have you not sacrificed enough,

19:35.054 --> 19:36.788
former Captain?

19:36.889 --> 19:39.625
Are you truly standing in front of me,

19:39.726 --> 19:42.527
prepared to sacrifice
your life to take mine?

19:42.628 --> 19:45.197
I am willing to make that sacrifice.

19:45.298 --> 19:47.699
But I don't need to.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.435
You can thank the other
Horseman for that.

19:51.204 --> 19:54.606
He has already claimed my soul.

19:54.707 --> 19:57.943
The question is... are you
prepared to sacrifice

19:58.044 --> 20:00.546
what's left of your life?

20:00.647 --> 20:02.814
Haven't <i> you</i>

20:02.915 --> 20:04.950
sacrificed enough?

20:05.051 --> 20:06.885
CRANE: Tell us where Moloch is,

20:06.986 --> 20:08.587
and you'll be spared.

20:08.688 --> 20:10.155
For now.

20:10.256 --> 20:12.324
Headless...

20:12.425 --> 20:14.526
armless.

20:16.929 --> 20:18.497
You know, I never studied fencing.

20:18.598 --> 20:20.566
But this sword

20:20.667 --> 20:23.068
does all the work for me.

20:23.169 --> 20:27.005
How many demons did
Methuselah kill with this?

20:27.106 --> 20:29.107
A thousand?

20:29.208 --> 20:31.948
- Stop!
- CRANE: Where is Moloch?

20:33.012 --> 20:35.247
- The Four Trees.
- The Four White Trees?

20:35.348 --> 20:37.115
Not anymore. I'm afraid the trees

20:37.216 --> 20:40.752
and the forest have taken on a darker hue.

20:40.853 --> 20:42.788
War and Moloch have begun

20:42.889 --> 20:45.557
to merge purgatory and this world.

20:46.893 --> 20:48.760
With each tree that is burned black,

20:48.861 --> 20:50.862
more evil may enter.

20:52.398 --> 20:54.700
<i>The blackening of the first white tree</i>

20:54.801 --> 20:56.869
<i>brought lightning.</i>

20:56.970 --> 21:00.238
<i>The second will bring blood.</i>

21:04.544 --> 21:07.279
The fall of the third tree will
bring Moloch's demon army.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.781
You may have seen them before.

21:13.486 --> 21:16.288
(snarling)

21:16.389 --> 21:18.290
And the fall of the fourth tree...

21:18.391 --> 21:20.926
Will complete the formation
of hell on Earth.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.229
Swing your sword as you will.

21:24.330 --> 21:26.298
Time...

21:26.399 --> 21:29.179
is not on your side.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.304
Just say the word.

21:32.405 --> 21:34.039
This is not the time.

21:34.807 --> 21:37.309
He may have more information.

21:37.410 --> 21:39.277
He might be of use later.

21:43.082 --> 21:44.616
Spare him.

21:46.452 --> 21:48.632
Moloch alone is our target tonight.

21:51.591 --> 21:53.225
Irving's got the Sword,
but if we're all going

21:53.326 --> 21:55.427
to fight a demon army,
we've all got to weapon up.

21:55.528 --> 21:57.930
What do you have in mind?

21:58.031 --> 22:00.432
(loud rock music playing)

22:01.334 --> 22:02.868
Oh!

22:02.969 --> 22:04.570
God bless Texas!

22:04.671 --> 22:07.405
(Hawley whoops)

22:12.278 --> 22:14.413
There is freedom worth fighting for.

22:14.514 --> 22:15.881
HAWLEY: What...?

22:15.982 --> 22:17.282
Hey!

22:17.383 --> 22:20.085
I didn't know you guys liked to party.

22:22.388 --> 22:24.289
Ah...

22:24.390 --> 22:27.459
I'm about to do something
less fun, aren't I?

22:27.560 --> 22:28.861
Still a party,

22:28.962 --> 22:30.495
just a hunting party.

22:31.364 --> 22:34.099
Moloch has risen.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.769
CRANE: We'll reconvene at the Archives.

22:36.870 --> 22:38.437
We need everything you've got.

22:38.538 --> 22:39.938
Every weapon in your arsenal.

22:40.039 --> 22:41.206
Wait, come on, everything?

22:41.307 --> 22:42.641
<i>Everything.</i>

22:42.742 --> 22:44.476
Look, I know you think it's the End,

22:44.577 --> 22:46.637
but do you know how many
people have gotten burned

22:46.679 --> 22:47.980
claiming the End is nigh?

22:48.081 --> 22:49.248
Every person.

22:49.349 --> 22:50.883
Every person in history

22:50.984 --> 22:52.964
who's ever said that has
been dead wrong, Mills.

22:53.052 --> 22:56.155
Doomsdayers are zero for 10,000 years.

22:56.256 --> 22:58.990
(thunder crashes)

23:16.376 --> 23:18.911
Ugh...

23:19.012 --> 23:20.479
Score one for the doomsdayers.

23:20.580 --> 23:21.747
It's hailing blood.

23:21.848 --> 23:23.515
Do you believe me now?

23:23.616 --> 23:26.118
Weapons, Hawley.

23:26.219 --> 23:28.887
I'll load up my truck.

23:35.339 --> 23:37.740
According to dubious lore,

23:37.841 --> 23:39.221
Blackbeard used these flintlocks

23:39.309 --> 23:41.577
to sink a Leviathan.

23:44.114 --> 23:46.983
A katana sword from the Jokoto period.

23:47.084 --> 23:50.086
You have a deep bench, my friend.

23:50.187 --> 23:52.889
Yeah, said to imbue its wielder

23:52.990 --> 23:54.991
with the strength of all
its previous samurais.

23:55.092 --> 23:56.492
(chanting quietly)

23:56.593 --> 23:58.895
Whoa, hey, uh... Ms. Crane...

23:58.996 --> 24:00.997
It's okay. She's a witch.

24:01.098 --> 24:02.832
Oh.

24:02.933 --> 24:05.168
Nice work.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.837
Some of these weapons
do possess ancient magic.

24:07.938 --> 24:09.105
I may be able to revitalize them,

24:09.206 --> 24:10.473
but it might require a moment.

24:10.474 --> 24:12.375
(thunder crashes)

24:12.476 --> 24:14.860
One moment may be all we have.

24:14.961 --> 24:17.680
As purgatory merges with the
real world, my power weakens.

24:17.781 --> 24:18.915
We must hurry.

24:19.016 --> 24:19.949
Where's Abbie?

24:20.050 --> 24:21.110
She's with the Horseman.

24:21.118 --> 24:22.585
Horseman?

24:22.686 --> 24:24.387
Yes. Mr. Hawley...

24:24.488 --> 24:27.423
we may have one more
favor to prevail upon you.

24:28.359 --> 24:29.726
Wow.

24:29.827 --> 24:31.461
This ain't no Wendigo.

24:31.562 --> 24:33.596
ABBIE: The Horseman of Death.

24:33.697 --> 24:36.199
One of the Four Horsemen.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.101
You-you sure he can't get out?

24:38.202 --> 24:40.536
This cell was designed by

24:40.637 --> 24:42.705
Thomas Jefferson and a
coven of witches to hold him.

24:42.706 --> 24:43.973
And others like him.

24:44.074 --> 24:46.376
So you want me to babysit this guy

24:46.477 --> 24:48.144
while you and the A-Team

24:48.245 --> 24:49.612
go stop the Horseman of War

24:49.713 --> 24:51.214
and his boss, Moloch.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.815
ABBIE: May be more than just babysitting.

24:52.916 --> 24:54.317
Demons may try to break him out...

24:54.318 --> 24:55.885
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

24:55.986 --> 24:57.787
He could.

24:57.888 --> 24:59.822
Our world is merging with
purgatory; all bets are off.

24:59.923 --> 25:01.057
That's why,

25:01.158 --> 25:02.292
as soon as Katrina's done

25:02.393 --> 25:03.560
enchanting those weapons,

25:03.661 --> 25:05.128
we get out there and stop Moloch.

25:05.229 --> 25:07.063
Okay. Yeah. Why not?

25:07.164 --> 25:08.665
Oh.

25:08.766 --> 25:10.066
So we're clear?

25:10.167 --> 25:11.801
I need to trust you

25:11.902 --> 25:14.037
to watch over the Headless
Horseman until we get back.

25:14.038 --> 25:15.271
It's not a party;

25:15.372 --> 25:16.506
you cannot have any friends over.

25:16.607 --> 25:18.408
Mills, I get it.

25:18.509 --> 25:19.742
The world's gonna end.

25:19.843 --> 25:20.977
You gotta stop that.

25:21.078 --> 25:23.079
And if you don't, I imagine

25:23.180 --> 25:26.549
I'm gonna hear about it pretty quickly.

25:31.055 --> 25:33.957
I overheard you today.

25:34.058 --> 25:36.192
Talking to Abraham.

25:36.293 --> 25:38.161
You said you cared for him,

25:38.262 --> 25:40.430
and somehow I'm certain you mean it.

25:40.531 --> 25:42.098
- Ichabod...
- I understand

25:42.199 --> 25:44.934
your relationship with
him is complicated.

25:45.035 --> 25:46.603
He was your captor.

25:46.704 --> 25:47.884
What are you trying to say?

25:47.938 --> 25:49.672
I'm trying to understand...

25:49.773 --> 25:51.441
to understand

25:51.542 --> 25:53.543
your experience as a captive.

25:53.644 --> 25:55.411
Whether it somehow tainted me.

25:56.447 --> 25:57.780
I love you, Ichabod,

25:57.881 --> 25:59.883
but I cannot fight two wars at once.

25:59.984 --> 26:01.718
Despite your words to the contrary,

26:01.819 --> 26:04.020
clearly you've lost
faith in my judgment.

26:04.121 --> 26:06.122
As you have in mine.

26:06.223 --> 26:08.458
You left to the enemy den
without so much as a note.

26:08.559 --> 26:09.859
To kill the demon Moloch...

26:09.960 --> 26:11.194
Which you did not do.

26:11.295 --> 26:12.428
Everything I have ever done

26:12.429 --> 26:13.563
has first and foremost been

26:13.564 --> 26:15.331
to ensure our very survival,

26:15.432 --> 26:16.466
so that one day,

26:16.567 --> 26:17.700
you and I could return

26:17.801 --> 26:18.968
to husband and wife!

26:19.069 --> 26:20.036
"Husband and wife"?

26:20.137 --> 26:21.337
You're a spy,

26:21.438 --> 26:22.705
you're a witch,

26:22.806 --> 26:24.541
you lied to me about Mary's death.

26:24.642 --> 26:25.475
Sometimes,

26:25.576 --> 26:27.644
I question the very idea

26:27.745 --> 26:29.478
of our "marriage."

26:34.918 --> 26:37.320
Perhaps, then,

26:37.421 --> 26:40.289
until our mission is complete...

26:41.682 --> 26:43.622
...we are both better off
considering ourselves

26:43.661 --> 26:46.495
in the roles we have
to play in this war.

26:47.765 --> 26:49.732
Soldiers.

26:49.833 --> 26:51.567
And nothing more.

26:52.770 --> 26:57.507
Then we are but comrades in arms...

26:57.608 --> 26:59.709
until Moloch is defeated.

26:59.810 --> 27:01.644
(door bangs open)

27:08.485 --> 27:10.686
The weapons are readied.

27:12.189 --> 27:13.556
(thunder crashes)

27:13.657 --> 27:16.860
MOLOCH: The third tree burns

27:16.961 --> 27:19.395
and we still await
the Horseman of Death.

27:19.496 --> 27:22.031
The witch created weakness in Abraham.

27:22.132 --> 27:23.433
She must have delayed him.

27:23.534 --> 27:24.801
The Sword.

27:24.902 --> 27:28.805
You should have prevented this.

27:28.906 --> 27:32.208
But, Moloch, Abraham's
failure is not my own.

27:32.309 --> 27:34.777
I shall send the first of my army...

27:34.878 --> 27:38.314
and War.

27:51.829 --> 27:54.497
(snarling)

27:59.937 --> 28:02.238
(insects trilling)

28:02.339 --> 28:04.774
I take it you two spoke.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.009
We agreed.

28:06.110 --> 28:07.577
We share a single focus:

28:07.678 --> 28:09.512
- Moloch.
- (gunshot)

28:12.549 --> 28:13.769
We got company!

28:14.718 --> 28:16.252
(yowls)

28:16.620 --> 28:18.421
(screams)

28:29.033 --> 28:30.766
Ichabod! Aah!

28:31.769 --> 28:33.470
(groans)

28:33.571 --> 28:36.372
Get her to safety!

28:36.907 --> 28:38.407
Try and stake its chest!

28:44.281 --> 28:45.782
Uh...

28:45.883 --> 28:47.117
Rah!

28:47.218 --> 28:49.051
(grunting)

29:04.268 --> 29:06.435
- (horse neighs)
- War.

29:08.138 --> 29:11.407
I got this.

29:13.177 --> 29:14.544
(yells)

29:14.645 --> 29:17.113
(grunting)

29:29.927 --> 29:32.562
The Sword...

29:37.835 --> 29:39.101
(yells)

29:49.480 --> 29:51.447
(screams)

30:21.679 --> 30:23.279
(exhales)

30:37.027 --> 30:38.161
Katrina!

30:38.262 --> 30:40.696
No, Captain.

30:44.034 --> 30:45.769
CRANE: All right. Captain?

30:45.870 --> 30:49.172
Captain, Katrina is going
to work her magic. Yes?

30:49.273 --> 30:51.074
- (chanting)
- All right, Captain.

30:51.175 --> 30:52.308
Look at me.

30:52.409 --> 30:53.710
Look at me, Captain. Look. Look.

30:53.711 --> 30:56.846
All is well.

30:58.549 --> 31:00.083
KATRINA: The merging

31:00.184 --> 31:01.533
of the worlds, I cannot
stop the bleeding.

31:01.634 --> 31:02.619
Keep trying!

31:02.720 --> 31:03.987
- (Katrina sobs)
- Captain...

31:04.088 --> 31:05.321
Captain, look at me.

31:05.422 --> 31:06.682
Look at me!
(Katrina chanting)

31:06.690 --> 31:08.758
You hold on...

31:09.794 --> 31:11.628
You fight.

31:11.729 --> 31:13.763
You're a captain, you fight.

31:13.864 --> 31:17.166
You... you fight.

32:17.451 --> 32:18.885
We lost him.

32:18.986 --> 32:21.187
JENNY: Is he really gone?

32:22.990 --> 32:24.324
KATRINA: He saved our lives.

32:24.425 --> 32:25.826
He died a hero.

32:25.927 --> 32:29.229
And in his name, we soldier on.

32:30.598 --> 32:33.834
I swear to you,

32:33.935 --> 32:36.236
his sacrifice will not be in vain.

32:36.337 --> 32:38.771
No, it will not.

32:41.809 --> 32:43.310
Frank was our friend.

32:43.411 --> 32:44.711
Our family.

32:44.812 --> 32:46.046
We owe it to him.

32:46.147 --> 32:47.250
I'm taking out Moloch.

32:47.351 --> 32:49.316
Lieutenant, you cannot
possibly carry the Sword.

32:49.317 --> 32:51.017
It is not up for debate.

32:51.118 --> 32:53.019
No, it is not!

32:53.120 --> 32:54.740
Do not make me wrest it from you.

32:59.126 --> 33:01.328
I cannot lose another friend

33:01.429 --> 33:02.729
by Moloch's hand.

33:02.830 --> 33:03.830
Ichabod...

33:03.931 --> 33:05.565
I am sorry, my love.

33:05.666 --> 33:07.868
But I have been on borrowed time

33:07.969 --> 33:09.603
for far too long.

33:09.704 --> 33:12.773
I awoke in this...

33:12.874 --> 33:15.175
strange time

33:15.276 --> 33:17.444
for no reason

33:17.545 --> 33:18.879
other than this moment.

33:18.980 --> 33:21.715
It ends now, with purpose.

33:21.816 --> 33:22.956
No.

33:23.618 --> 33:25.018
It's not just you.

33:25.119 --> 33:26.219
All of us, here...

33:26.320 --> 33:28.088
we chose to be here.

33:28.189 --> 33:30.424
You, me, Katrina, Jenny and Frank.

33:30.525 --> 33:33.193
We're in this together.

33:33.294 --> 33:34.428
That is how we will win.

33:34.529 --> 33:37.030
We found the Sword together.

33:37.131 --> 33:38.565
Only one can wield it.

33:38.666 --> 33:40.233
And it'll be me, first.

33:40.334 --> 33:42.842
And when I fall, you can pick it up.

33:42.943 --> 33:44.538
And if we don't finish the job...

33:44.639 --> 33:46.773
I shall pick up the Sword.

33:46.874 --> 33:48.441
Then me.

33:49.710 --> 33:51.219
Until today, we've only been asked

33:51.320 --> 33:52.479
to make sacrifices of ourselves.

33:52.580 --> 33:53.980
But now?

33:54.081 --> 33:56.049
We've got to be willing
to sacrifice others,

33:56.150 --> 33:57.284
the ones we love.

33:57.385 --> 33:59.286
I am not gonna let Moloch

33:59.387 --> 34:01.388
take another soul from this earth.

34:01.489 --> 34:03.656
Never again.

34:05.259 --> 34:07.427
You are right.

34:07.528 --> 34:09.129
Thank you.

34:09.230 --> 34:11.664
Don't thank me yet;
you haven't heard my plan.

34:13.333 --> 34:16.436
(unearthly howl)

34:16.536 --> 34:18.804
Go. It is not done yet.

34:18.906 --> 34:20.574
You must retrieve the Sword.

34:20.675 --> 34:22.275
Father, how?

34:22.376 --> 34:24.444
They have destroyed my armor.

34:24.545 --> 34:27.647
I am vulnerable.

34:27.748 --> 34:30.550
You will delay them.

34:32.453 --> 34:34.855
I don't understand.

34:34.956 --> 34:37.357
I am the Second Horseman!

34:37.458 --> 34:38.958
You would have me die?

34:39.060 --> 34:40.494
MOLOCH: There were Horsemen before you,

34:40.594 --> 34:41.962
there will be Horsemen after.

34:42.063 --> 34:44.498
Be grateful for the chance

34:44.599 --> 34:47.734
to sacrifice yourself for my glory.

34:49.370 --> 34:51.004
Today begins my reign.

34:51.105 --> 34:53.306
You will find them at the church.

34:53.407 --> 34:55.208
Now go.

34:58.746 --> 35:01.581
Father...

35:02.817 --> 35:05.952
I will obey.

35:29.610 --> 35:32.179
ABBIE: War is hell.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.247
Or, more accurately,

35:34.348 --> 35:36.416
we sent War back to hell.

35:36.517 --> 35:38.018
Planning on coming for you,

35:38.119 --> 35:39.553
but this'll work, too.

35:39.654 --> 35:41.688
How pathetic.

35:41.789 --> 35:43.557
Ichabod is hiding.

35:43.658 --> 35:47.285
Forcing his injured partner
to face me alone.

35:47.386 --> 35:48.929
- I volunteered.
- Well...

35:49.030 --> 35:51.832
let's see what you're made of,

35:51.933 --> 35:53.900
Lieutenant.

35:54.001 --> 35:55.021
You think you can hide?

35:55.036 --> 35:56.736
You've already lost.

36:01.776 --> 36:04.010
You brought roots to a sword fight?

36:04.846 --> 36:08.848
(groaning)

36:14.989 --> 36:17.524
(laughing)

36:28.403 --> 36:30.704
(Henry exhales)

36:31.839 --> 36:33.774
KATRINA: <i>Depellerent omne illisio.</i>

36:33.875 --> 36:35.608
<i>Simus anulum.</i>

36:38.913 --> 36:40.614
Do not move.

36:40.715 --> 36:42.116
Put the sword down.

36:42.217 --> 36:43.787
Our quarrel isn't with you, Henry.

36:43.888 --> 36:45.553
Step aside

36:45.654 --> 36:46.787
and let us meet Moloch.

36:46.888 --> 36:49.957
It won't be that easy.

36:54.996 --> 36:56.136
If you want to leave here,

36:56.231 --> 36:58.399
your only option is to kill me...

36:58.500 --> 36:59.900
Father.

37:01.369 --> 37:04.037
So here I am. Kill me.

37:14.052 --> 37:16.487
Can you see it?

37:16.588 --> 37:19.323
The life pulsing in my throat?

37:20.892 --> 37:22.993
Make the slightest of motions

37:23.094 --> 37:25.562
and humanity will be saved.

37:26.531 --> 37:29.366
What will it be, Father?

37:31.369 --> 37:33.589
Crane, you know what you have to do.

37:33.939 --> 37:36.173
In Genesis,

37:36.274 --> 37:37.641
God commanded Abraham

37:37.742 --> 37:39.977
to sacrifice his son, Isaac.

37:40.078 --> 37:42.947
The binding of Isaac.

37:43.048 --> 37:45.516
Yes, I've read this tragic little story.

37:45.617 --> 37:47.952
Abraham was willing.

37:48.053 --> 37:51.088
But at the very last moment,

37:51.189 --> 37:53.457
God provided him with a ram

37:53.558 --> 37:56.093
to sacrifice in Isaac's stead.

37:56.194 --> 37:57.094
Crane!

37:57.195 --> 37:58.529
I will give my life

37:58.630 --> 38:00.431
wielding this sword against you if I must.

38:00.532 --> 38:03.133
But we have another way.

38:03.234 --> 38:04.935
A mighty ram.

38:05.036 --> 38:06.470
Moloch...

38:06.571 --> 38:07.471
Moloch.

38:07.572 --> 38:08.806
My son,

38:08.907 --> 38:11.174
let me pass...

38:12.243 --> 38:14.278
...and I will dispatch Moloch to hell

38:14.379 --> 38:15.513
and you will be free

38:15.614 --> 38:17.381
to live a life of your making,

38:17.482 --> 38:19.717
not a pawn in his game,

38:19.818 --> 38:22.319
but as a loved one

38:22.420 --> 38:24.288
in a world of free will.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.890
You...

38:25.991 --> 38:28.893
you would let me live

38:28.994 --> 38:32.129
while you go face Moloch and die?

38:32.230 --> 38:33.864
That is what sacrifice is.

38:35.133 --> 38:37.902
Allow me to fulfill
my duty as a Witness

38:38.003 --> 38:39.670
and end this madness.

38:39.771 --> 38:41.205
Henry,

38:41.306 --> 38:42.673
let us pass!

38:42.774 --> 38:45.442
You never gave up on me.

38:46.945 --> 38:48.879
You never will.

38:55.153 --> 38:57.387
(grunts)
(growling)

39:02.260 --> 39:03.260
PARISH: As an immortal,

39:03.261 --> 39:05.763
I can wield this with impunity.

39:05.864 --> 39:09.700
Faith, hope and charity;

39:09.801 --> 39:13.604
the Holy Trinity has brought you
to your knees again, Father.

39:14.372 --> 39:15.773
Come.

39:15.874 --> 39:18.642
Moloch is waiting.

39:44.336 --> 39:46.437
Kill the witch.

39:46.538 --> 39:50.173
Then the final tree will burn.

39:53.678 --> 39:55.112
But she is Abraham's.

39:55.213 --> 39:56.981
Abraham failed. He gets nothing.

39:57.082 --> 39:59.283
The witch dies first.

39:59.384 --> 40:01.252
PARISH: But Abraham is awaiting

40:01.353 --> 40:02.653
the bargain you made with him.

40:02.754 --> 40:03.487
He is nothing.

40:03.588 --> 40:05.789
You are nothing

40:05.890 --> 40:07.391
but what I made you.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.894
Sacrifice your mother.

40:09.995 --> 40:11.128
Now.

40:11.229 --> 40:13.130
(thunder crashes)

40:18.236 --> 40:20.804
Very well.

40:35.387 --> 40:36.820
Take me!

40:37.923 --> 40:39.023
Take me.

40:39.124 --> 40:40.424
Ichabod, it's me he wants.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.059
Enough.

40:49.067 --> 40:52.436
You tell me of Abraham's sacrifice.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.472
The Akeda,

40:54.573 --> 40:57.274
the story of a cruel and merciless God

40:57.375 --> 41:00.010
who designed a cruel
and merciless world.

41:01.813 --> 41:04.148
Who could worship a deity

41:04.249 --> 41:07.485
who commands a man to
sacrifice his own son?

41:07.586 --> 41:09.687
Those days have come

41:09.788 --> 41:11.322
to an end.

41:11.423 --> 41:14.291
The true lesson of the story

41:14.392 --> 41:16.026
comes not from Abraham,

41:16.127 --> 41:17.694
but from Isaac.

41:18.630 --> 41:20.397
The chasm between father and son

41:20.498 --> 41:21.665
was never bridged.

41:21.766 --> 41:23.600
They never spoke again.

41:24.502 --> 41:26.904
And justly so!

41:27.005 --> 41:29.306
For any man

41:29.407 --> 41:31.942
willing to sacrifice his child...

41:33.345 --> 41:36.880
...should die.

41:41.152 --> 41:43.387
As should any god!

41:58.725 --> 42:03.050
