WEBVTT

01:12.948 --> 01:17.254
<i>Rejected by the
dictator of Panama, general Manuel noriega.</i>

03:09.099 --> 03:11.934
<i>Serviceman...</i>

04:09.559 --> 04:11.061
<i>Contacted the...</i>

05:03.280 --> 05:05.914
<i>Let me tell ya,
there's nothing more rock and roll</i>

05:06.049 --> 05:10.053
<i>than taking out the bad guys
for the red, white and blue.</i>

05:10.186 --> 05:15.125
<i>But every mission had its price,
and this last one was heavy.</i>

05:15.258 --> 05:20.397
<i>If there's ever a guy needed for
a tough job, this was him. Becker.</i>

05:57.966 --> 06:00.036
<i>The thing
about working as an operator</i>

06:00.170 --> 06:02.605
<i>is you come up
against a lot of bad guys,</i>

06:02.739 --> 06:03.972
<i>fuckheads like this.</i>

06:06.543 --> 06:08.411
Fuck!

06:08.545 --> 06:12.582
<i>Off the record,
his real name was James mcleod.</i>

06:13.916 --> 06:15.951
<i>Now let's slow this down a bit.</i>

06:38.575 --> 06:40.810
<i>I always knew where to find him.</i>

06:40.943 --> 06:43.980
<i>He's been passed out by his
wife's grave for over a year.</i>

06:44.114 --> 06:46.915
All right, Sam. Fetch him.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.101
Hey, sweetheart.

07:05.235 --> 07:06.836
Sweet, but undisciplined.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.439
But you'd know all about
that, wouldn't ya?

07:15.011 --> 07:16.546
What do you want, John?

07:16.679 --> 07:18.581
I have an assignment.

07:20.216 --> 07:22.419
I'm not interested.

07:22.552 --> 07:24.953
Sarah's been gone
for over a year now, Becker.

07:25.088 --> 07:27.724
Fuck.

07:27.857 --> 07:30.527
You spent that whole time
agonizing over your guilt.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.605
You blame yourself, and hell,
you're probably right.

07:32.629 --> 07:34.764
I mean, it was
your fault after all.

07:34.898 --> 07:36.578
But if you're gonna
commit suicide over it,

07:36.699 --> 07:39.302
just please, stick a gun in your
mouth, get it over with.

07:39.436 --> 07:42.971
This waiting for your liver
to drop out could take years.

07:48.478 --> 07:51.614
She died, John, because I
didn't protect her from me.

07:53.249 --> 07:54.651
From what I do.

07:57.687 --> 07:59.189
She was innocent.

08:03.092 --> 08:05.028
I put her in danger.

08:06.796 --> 08:10.567
Somehow I cheated
her out of her own fucking life.

08:12.135 --> 08:14.170
And I didn't get revenge for it.

08:14.304 --> 08:16.773
That's not true, kid. Not true.

08:16.906 --> 08:19.342
We tracked and killed
all three of those... people.

08:19.476 --> 08:23.046
You don't get it.
I needed to fucking kill them.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.417
- Me.
- I understand. I get it.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.820
Luckily for you, Providence
placed the antidote

08:30.954 --> 08:32.522
not too far away
from the poison.

08:32.655 --> 08:34.823
You need a purpose,
I got one for ya.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.092
It's far away from here.

08:36.226 --> 08:38.962
Warm climate, Sandy beaches,
palm trees.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.566
Remember when you sold that tank
lander with a sinkhole in it?

08:44.801 --> 08:45.801
Yeah, in Panama.

08:45.902 --> 08:47.670
<i>Panama.</i>

08:49.105 --> 08:50.406
Report to nellis.

08:50.540 --> 08:53.309
9:00 A.M., Monday morning.
We'll brief you.

08:54.177 --> 08:56.079
Don't hold your breath.

08:57.046 --> 08:58.681
I'll be turning blue.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.783
Make it 10:00.

09:02.285 --> 09:04.120
Come on, Sam. Where are you?

09:54.337 --> 09:57.574
<i>His sister-in-law
checks in on him now and again.</i>

09:57.707 --> 10:00.076
<i>Probably the only reason
he's still alive.</i>

10:11.588 --> 10:14.290
At least I made you laugh, huh?

10:25.069 --> 10:26.436
Here. Drink.

10:32.575 --> 10:34.177
Do you remember that?

10:39.115 --> 10:40.550
We look happy, huh?

10:46.155 --> 10:48.124
You could use a shower.

11:34.671 --> 11:38.374
You sure Becker's the right guy? He's a boy
scout, and we're sending him to a whorehouse.

11:38.508 --> 11:40.877
He's the best bullet catcher
we had once.

11:41.011 --> 11:43.946
- He'll be fine.
- I wouldn't call this boy a scout.

11:44.081 --> 11:46.783
His file looks like
an international rap sheet.

11:48.451 --> 11:51.088
I've heard he's bullheaded and willful.
He may question command.

11:51.220 --> 11:54.424
It's true. He has no respect for
rank and pretense of any kind.

11:54.557 --> 11:56.997
- But that's a good thing, isn't it?
- Then he might go rogue.

11:57.094 --> 11:59.505
If things don't go to plan,
I don't want that blood on my hands.

11:59.529 --> 12:02.398
Blood on your hands?
Are you sure that's not lotion?

12:02.532 --> 12:04.434
I wouldn't worry
about the blood, burns.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.269
After what you and I
did in Vietnam,

12:06.402 --> 12:09.173
we'll spend an eternity
on the meat rack.

12:09.305 --> 12:12.742
- Hey, cyn, don't you have a flight to catch?
- Gentlemen.

12:13.443 --> 12:15.478
<i>- Buen viaje.
- Gracias.</i>

12:26.355 --> 12:29.026
- Hey, bro.
- Stark.

12:29.159 --> 12:32.795
I'd like you to meet Hank
burns, outta socom in DC.

12:32.929 --> 12:34.897
He's here to aid and assist
where necessary.

12:35.032 --> 12:37.333
Let's cut through all the bullshit.
What's your part?

12:37.467 --> 12:41.205
Already I can tell by your
attitude you're asshole-validated.

12:41.337 --> 12:44.108
Forewarned, you're not the
only us marine standing here.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.309
By the looks of you,
you're an 0141.

12:48.244 --> 12:50.684
- Were you in the fucking air corps?
- And proud of it, grunt.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.716
Conflict! I love it.
But we're here to work together.

12:53.850 --> 12:58.421
Gung ho, semper fi, all that marine
brotherhood shit. You know, all of that.

12:58.554 --> 13:00.556
I'll do my job, stark,
like I always do.

13:00.690 --> 13:02.658
Just keep this CIA wannabe
away from me.

13:02.792 --> 13:06.829
Good. Well, now we're all
buds, here's the deal.

13:07.630 --> 13:09.866
<i>Since the Iran-contra bullshit,</i>

13:10.000 --> 13:13.003
<i>fort sherman in Panama
is the CIA conduit</i>

13:13.137 --> 13:15.371
for supplying arms
to the contras in Nicaragua.

13:15.505 --> 13:17.507
Noriega's become unreliable.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.640
<i>With all the cocaine
and crown royal in his system,</i>

13:19.675 --> 13:21.353
we never know which <i>El
general</i> we're talking to.

13:21.377 --> 13:24.514
Operationally,
Panama's managed by colonel justines.

13:24.647 --> 13:26.716
<i>We consider him a friend.
He's very approachable.</i>

13:26.849 --> 13:30.486
The boland amendment bars the us from
selling arms directly to the contras,

13:30.620 --> 13:34.590
so the CIA is constantly looking for
creative, cute new ways to fund them.

13:34.724 --> 13:38.694
Now, the first order of business?
Buy a Russian chopper.

13:38.828 --> 13:42.199
All right? Now, burns here is an
expert in Soviet military equipment.

13:42.331 --> 13:45.135
Now, with your level-three
clearance and user permit,

13:45.269 --> 13:48.404
you are the perfect guy to make
the Russian chopper transaction.

13:48.538 --> 13:51.474
Clear as mud? No?
Let me explain.

13:51.607 --> 13:55.012
There are some friends of uncle
Sam that wanna kill a guy,

13:55.145 --> 13:57.680
and they want a Russian
chopper to do it, okay?

13:57.814 --> 13:59.682
Now, we like that they're
gonna kill this guy,

13:59.816 --> 14:01.818
so we're gonna shell out
to buy 'em a chopper.

14:01.951 --> 14:04.988
- Yeah? Who's selling?
- Noriega. Fucking communist.

14:05.122 --> 14:08.292
He wants ten mil transferred
to his personal Swiss account.

14:08.424 --> 14:09.792
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

14:09.926 --> 14:11.861
Nope.
The contras want the chopper.

14:11.995 --> 14:13.973
In return, they'll give us
Soviet weaponry and intel.

14:13.997 --> 14:17.600
So we're buying a chopper from
noriega and using it to kill him?

14:17.733 --> 14:20.336
- I love the poetic irony in that, huh?
- I knew you would.

14:20.469 --> 14:22.005
It tickles the shit out of me.

14:22.139 --> 14:25.474
Our contact for picking up
the chopper is in Panama.

14:25.608 --> 14:27.128
Now, it's gonna take
a couple of weeks,

14:27.211 --> 14:28.878
so tourist visa
ain't gonna cut it.

14:29.012 --> 14:31.181
- Right, so I need a legitimate job.
- That's right.

14:31.315 --> 14:33.850
So from now on, you're a
consultant for casinos nationale.

14:33.984 --> 14:36.919
Bump up the revenue.
Reel in the suckers, okay?

14:37.054 --> 14:38.354
We'll help ya.

14:38.487 --> 14:40.523
Question for both of you.
Is this all legal?

14:40.656 --> 14:43.459
Sure. Lawyers are okay with it.

14:43.593 --> 14:45.195
You gonna have
a problem with this?

14:46.529 --> 14:49.899
You pay me, I act, burns.
It's a simple fucking deal.

14:50.033 --> 14:52.869
But you have opinions.

14:53.003 --> 14:54.570
- I'll see ya, stark.
- Yeah.

14:54.704 --> 14:56.039
Only good ones.

14:56.173 --> 14:58.441
There you go. Buddies.
Look at that.

15:05.882 --> 15:09.186
<i>Now, once you get settled,
you'll meet with Enrique Rodriguez.</i>

15:09.319 --> 15:11.188
<i>His father was
a former government official</i>

15:11.321 --> 15:13.323
<i>who died when Enrique was 12.</i>

15:13.456 --> 15:16.293
<i>He's very connected
and Harvard educated.</i>

15:16.425 --> 15:18.494
<i>Marcos justines
is his godfather,</i>

15:18.628 --> 15:20.063
<i>his uncle, Billy Ford,</i>

15:20.197 --> 15:21.831
<i>who opposes noriega
in the election.</i>

15:21.964 --> 15:25.801
<i>Enrique is brokering
the chopper deal.</i>

15:25.935 --> 15:28.804
<i>Now, we wired him
a clean million as a deposit,</i>

15:28.938 --> 15:30.606
<i>but the dipshit
probably spent it already.</i>

15:30.740 --> 15:32.842
<i>He's overly fond
of blow and hookers.</i>

15:41.285 --> 15:42.485
I'm Becker.

15:43.786 --> 15:46.256
<i>Hola.</i> I'm to drive you
to see seÃ±or Rodriguez.

15:49.393 --> 15:50.893
- Same place.
- Okay.

15:51.028 --> 15:53.397
No, no, I got it. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

15:53.529 --> 15:55.631
- It's my job, okay?
- Okay.

15:56.233 --> 15:57.466
<i>Gracias.</i>

16:44.147 --> 16:45.147
SeÃ±or Becker.

16:45.215 --> 16:46.716
SeÃ±or Rodriguez.

16:46.849 --> 16:48.651
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

16:48.784 --> 16:50.753
- Sit.
- Thank you.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.892
My friends call me Enrique.

16:57.027 --> 17:00.030
- I expect you to call me the same.
- All right.

17:01.431 --> 17:03.467
What do your friends call you?

17:03.599 --> 17:05.035
- Becker.
- Becker.

17:05.768 --> 17:07.304
What do your girlfriends
call you?

17:07.436 --> 17:08.503
- The same.
- Becker?

17:08.637 --> 17:10.207
Yeah.

17:10.339 --> 17:11.973
- Simple enough.
- Yes, sir.

17:12.108 --> 17:16.945
- This is Valentina, my fiancÃ©e.
- <i>Mucho gusto.</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:21.218
<i>Mi amor,</i> seÃ±or Becker and I
need to discuss business.

17:21.351 --> 17:23.220
Catch you later? Yeah?

17:24.454 --> 17:25.688
Kiss.

17:31.694 --> 17:33.896
Enrique, that's a lovely lady.

17:35.332 --> 17:36.565
A bitch.

17:38.235 --> 17:41.171
- So, you like this place?
- Yeah, yeah, sure. It's nice.

17:41.304 --> 17:42.638
All right. Pablo.

17:43.507 --> 17:44.707
Leave the bags.

17:45.674 --> 17:48.311
- It's yours.
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:48.445 --> 17:52.416
So, let's talk about
the helicopter, shall we?

17:52.548 --> 17:53.783
Hmm.

17:56.186 --> 18:00.323
Later. I don't usually talk about
business this late in the day.

18:01.258 --> 18:02.825
But we're going to
have plenty of time

18:02.958 --> 18:05.228
for such a tedious discussion.

18:06.363 --> 18:08.298
Relax. Sophia.

18:12.635 --> 18:15.805
This is Sophia, my fiancÃ©e.

18:16.906 --> 18:19.842
I like it.

18:21.311 --> 18:22.479
Nice to meet you.

18:22.611 --> 18:23.913
<i>CariÃ±o mÃ­o,</i>

18:24.047 --> 18:26.983
seÃ±or Becker and I
are discussing business.

18:27.117 --> 18:28.717
Meet you later at the pool?

18:36.193 --> 18:37.227
Come.

18:39.262 --> 18:42.332
Panama has lots to offer
a man like you.

18:44.267 --> 18:45.668
Just settle in.

18:47.337 --> 18:49.005
Enjoy yourself.

18:49.139 --> 18:51.274
In time we'll make
our deal. Drink?

18:51.408 --> 18:53.843
Shot of whiskey,
if you don't mind.

19:04.787 --> 19:06.022
Cheers.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.329
Ah, Isabella.

19:15.499 --> 19:17.900
<i>Man, I thought
the '70s were sexy.</i>

19:18.034 --> 19:20.403
<i>There's nothing like the '80s.</i>

19:23.873 --> 19:26.343
Isabella, meet seÃ±or Becker.

19:26.476 --> 19:31.680
Becker, I am pleased to introduce
you my fiancÃ©e, Isabella.

19:34.850 --> 19:36.086
Nice to...

19:47.497 --> 19:48.864
You're a lucky man, seÃ±or.

19:48.999 --> 19:51.268
- Welcome.
- Yeah.

19:59.742 --> 20:01.044
James mcleod.

20:03.079 --> 20:04.447
What did you say?

20:05.515 --> 20:06.882
James mcleod.

20:08.985 --> 20:10.625
Nobody's called me that
since high school.

20:10.753 --> 20:13.156
- Who are you?
- Brooklyn Rivera.

20:13.290 --> 20:16.393
- Brooklyn, huh?
- My father was a Dodgers fan.

20:16.526 --> 20:19.596
Yeah. You part
of the contras or what?

20:19.728 --> 20:21.431
We prefer the term commandos.

20:21.565 --> 20:22.898
The term contra-revolution

20:23.033 --> 20:25.101
implies we're trying
to restore the government

20:25.235 --> 20:27.270
prior
to the sandinista revolution.

20:27.404 --> 20:30.207
We certainly are not.

20:30.340 --> 20:32.609
So are you here to discuss
the chopper deal or what?

20:32.741 --> 20:35.412
I cannot make a deal without
the consent of my <i>comandante,</i>

20:35.545 --> 20:36.980
steadman fagoth muller.

20:37.113 --> 20:40.217
- Steadman muller?
- Steadman fagoth muller.

20:40.350 --> 20:43.053
He's very peculiar
about how he's addressed.

20:43.186 --> 20:46.356
When he was a child, his middle
name was the subject of teasing,

20:46.489 --> 20:49.125
so he beat up everyone who
tried to make a joke of it

20:49.259 --> 20:51.294
and forced them all
to call him by his full name.

20:51.428 --> 20:54.297
Yeah, he sounds
like an asshole to me.

20:55.665 --> 20:59.269
- Finish your beer. Then we can go meet with him.
- Yeah.

20:59.402 --> 21:01.471
Tell you what.
Why don't we meet up in my suite

21:01.605 --> 21:03.440
in, say, an hour,
hour and a half, all right?

21:03.573 --> 21:07.177
You don't understand.
I have a plane waiting.

21:08.478 --> 21:11.648
- A plane?
- Courtesy of your department of defense.

21:11.780 --> 21:15.085
Mr. Burns will be there.

21:15.218 --> 21:17.587
Man, I just got off a plane.

21:17.721 --> 21:19.155
Where are we going?

21:20.557 --> 21:21.790
Miami.

21:39.242 --> 21:41.544
We going to the safe
house in little Havana?

21:41.678 --> 21:43.779
No, not that one.

21:45.115 --> 21:46.815
You'll like it.

21:53.390 --> 21:54.424
Turn here.

21:58.461 --> 22:00.796
You know, if you're taking me
to the safe house, burns,

22:00.929 --> 22:03.166
you should probably
put a hood on me.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.069
You were vetted. Level three.

22:34.030 --> 22:35.799
Stick your tongue out, please.

22:35.931 --> 22:37.267
Huh?

22:37.400 --> 22:40.236
I said, stick
your tongue out, please.

22:40.370 --> 22:42.005
No, thanks.

22:43.139 --> 22:44.907
In Tibet,
it's a traditional greeting

22:45.041 --> 22:47.711
to know if your visitor
has evil thoughts.

22:47.843 --> 22:50.347
Do you have evil thoughts,
Mr. Becker?

22:51.981 --> 22:53.350
Yeah, all the time.

22:57.754 --> 22:59.955
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

23:00.090 --> 23:01.691
In america, we shake hands.

23:01.825 --> 23:03.226
- That's how it works.
- Okay.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.862
A firm handshake, but not too firm.
I like that.

23:06.996 --> 23:09.265
Sometimes people
like to shake too firmly

23:09.399 --> 23:11.477
and try to hide something,
and that makes me suspicious.

23:11.501 --> 23:13.570
Mm-hmm. Make you sound paranoid.

23:13.703 --> 23:16.272
Try and be nice, Becker. He's on our side.

23:16.406 --> 23:18.842
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

23:18.974 --> 23:20.577
You say what is
in your mind, don't you?

23:20.710 --> 23:23.480
- Yeah.
- At least we don't have any communication problem.

23:23.613 --> 23:25.948
- No, we won't have any of that.
- Yeah.

23:26.082 --> 23:28.418
- Take a seat, please.
- Thank you.

23:33.323 --> 23:36.959
I hear that you want
Soviet communication equipment.

23:37.093 --> 23:38.528
As much as you can supply.

23:38.661 --> 23:39.829
And in exchange?

23:39.996 --> 23:42.031
A Soviet helicopter.

23:42.165 --> 23:44.601
That's what I wanna hear.

23:45.668 --> 23:47.036
And what is in it for you?

23:47.170 --> 23:48.805
What do you mean? Profit.

23:48.937 --> 23:50.540
That's the only reason?

23:50.673 --> 23:53.176
Is there anything else?

24:05.054 --> 24:06.356
<i>PapÃ¡ y mamÃ¡.</i>

24:06.922 --> 24:08.525
My parents.

24:11.161 --> 24:13.929
Sandinistas came in the
middle of the night,

24:15.031 --> 24:17.534
woke them up and shot them.

24:19.302 --> 24:21.237
And my wife and my daughter.

24:22.872 --> 24:25.241
Noriega ordered them killed.

24:26.776 --> 24:32.148
The soldiers raped my 12-year-old
daughter just in front of my wife.

24:34.017 --> 24:39.222
They shot them both in their face
and threw their bodies in a ditch.

24:39.355 --> 24:42.392
I am blamed because I wasn't
there to protect them.

24:43.893 --> 24:45.728
I'm sorry. I am.

24:45.862 --> 24:50.033
You see, it doesn't matter
how many sandinistas we kill.

24:50.166 --> 24:51.201
It is never enough.

24:51.334 --> 24:53.403
I have 3,000 men

24:54.270 --> 24:56.706
in the mountain of rus rus.

24:57.674 --> 25:00.810
And all they want
is kill sandinistas.

25:00.944 --> 25:03.980
They don't fight for democracy
as your government pretends.

25:04.113 --> 25:06.216
They don't even know
what that's for.

25:06.883 --> 25:09.352
They just want revenge.

25:09.486 --> 25:12.055
- Hmm.
- For the same reason I do.

25:12.822 --> 25:14.390
I know, I understand.

25:14.524 --> 25:17.327
Tomorrow morning
you're gonna go to Honduras

25:17.460 --> 25:21.164
with Brooklyn
to our refugee camp,

25:21.297 --> 25:23.766
and perhaps you'll truly
understand, Mr. Becker.

25:54.464 --> 25:58.368
Too many children here
with their families destroyed.

25:59.936 --> 26:01.371
Why? What happened?

26:01.504 --> 26:03.506
Their fathers
and mothers killed.

27:37.067 --> 27:38.301
<i>Hola.</i>

27:42.338 --> 27:43.806
You can sit next to her.

27:46.342 --> 27:47.577
<i>Puedo?</i>

27:49.046 --> 27:50.279
<i>Gracias.</i>

28:02.258 --> 28:03.660
They cut open
my father's stomach

28:03.793 --> 28:06.396
and let him bleed
until he was dead.

28:09.198 --> 28:12.902
And then told my mom
we were free to go.

28:17.907 --> 28:21.411
When we started walking,
they shot her in the back.

28:24.347 --> 28:25.581
I ran away.

28:30.353 --> 28:33.423
Then they told
everyone she was killed

28:33.556 --> 28:35.625
while she was trying to escape.

29:06.190 --> 29:07.423
So how can I help you?

29:07.557 --> 29:09.692
Deliver that Soviet helicopter.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.629
Until then...

29:16.332 --> 29:18.735
Help us kill some bad guys.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.500
<i>Comandante.</i>

29:55.505 --> 29:58.242
Mr. Becker.

30:02.345 --> 30:04.514
Okay. <i>Vamos.</i>

30:39.682 --> 30:41.851
You like rock music?

30:41.985 --> 30:44.720
I'm more of a Willie Nelson guy.

30:44.854 --> 30:47.890
- We'll make you a rock fan.
- I doubt it.

30:53.596 --> 30:56.966
Welcome to the jungle!

31:34.804 --> 31:36.906
Hey, who's on drums?

32:07.037 --> 32:09.039
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:10.107 --> 32:12.775
All right, go ahead.
Quick. Let's go. Move.

32:16.679 --> 32:18.881
What the fuck are you doing?

32:30.193 --> 32:32.528
You just killed a doctor
and a civilian.

32:33.663 --> 32:37.067
I thought you Americans
hated bolsheviks, huh?

32:38.201 --> 32:41.837
You sound like a civilian.
I thought you were a soldier.

32:44.074 --> 32:47.010
This is your nurse?
Look at your nurse.

32:47.144 --> 32:48.811
Huh?

32:48.945 --> 32:50.680
Perhaps this is your doctor.

32:56.953 --> 32:59.455
They would have killed you
the second you turned away.

32:59.588 --> 33:02.892
So now you see
the war that we fight.

33:05.062 --> 33:06.163
Huh?

33:07.897 --> 33:11.634
And bring me that chopper
if you want this equipment.

33:44.034 --> 33:48.472
<i>Jackie cordoza was the
biggest casino operator in Panama.</i>

33:48.604 --> 33:50.573
<i>I mean that in every damn way.</i>

33:52.442 --> 33:54.411
- SeÃ±or cordoza.
- Mr. Becker.

33:54.543 --> 33:57.481
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You too, sir.

33:57.613 --> 34:01.184
Becker, you were hired to increase
the take at the casinos nationale.

34:01.318 --> 34:04.087
- <i>SÃ­.</i>
- And the general here expects results.

34:04.221 --> 34:05.888
I'll do the best I can. I will.

34:06.023 --> 34:07.957
Well, please get to know
the operation.

34:08.091 --> 34:10.159
- But a word of advice, Becker.
- Yeah?

34:10.293 --> 34:12.762
- Don't look too deeply.
- Understand.

34:12.895 --> 34:14.331
Good. How was your weekend?

34:14.464 --> 34:17.000
- Idyllic, yeah. It was the best.
- Good. Excellent.

34:17.134 --> 34:19.402
Let me show you... oh.

34:19.534 --> 34:21.570
Let me give you the grand tour.

34:42.925 --> 34:44.860
<i>The thing
about drug dealers like Enrique</i>

34:44.995 --> 34:49.433
<i>is that they always answer to
someone with bigger cojones.</i>

34:49.565 --> 34:52.235
<i>And those McNuggets
belong to the colonel.</i>

34:52.369 --> 34:54.371
<i>Colonel Marcos justines,</i>

34:54.504 --> 34:57.640
<i>the second-most powerful man
in Panama behind noriega.</i>

34:57.773 --> 35:01.677
Enrique, lovely to see you.

35:01.811 --> 35:04.580
Colonel justines.
Come in, please.

35:09.086 --> 35:11.354
- It's a pleasure to see you, colonel.
- Thank you.

35:11.488 --> 35:13.123
- Champagne?
- Please.

35:15.525 --> 35:17.027
Please, come in.

35:18.694 --> 35:21.264
So...

35:22.365 --> 35:25.068
- You have plan for this evening?
- You know me.

35:26.536 --> 35:28.604
I have plans every night.

35:28.737 --> 35:33.176
Of course.
And it always involves <i>chiquillas.</i>

35:34.311 --> 35:36.712
Time to pay cordoza once again.

35:37.646 --> 35:39.949
El gordo?

35:40.083 --> 35:43.186
Yes, the fat man,
as you call him.

35:45.754 --> 35:47.090
Do you feel like gambling?

35:47.756 --> 35:50.759
- Sure.
- Good.

35:50.893 --> 35:52.828
He will be at the
marriott casino tonight.

35:54.097 --> 35:57.666
Hundred thousand.
Make sure you lose it all.

35:59.702 --> 36:01.238
And here is, uh...

36:10.646 --> 36:13.216
Thank you, colonel.

36:14.317 --> 36:16.086
The helicopter deal.

36:16.219 --> 36:18.921
I'll get my usual taste
of that, I presume?

36:20.357 --> 36:21.391
A taste?

36:22.958 --> 36:25.728
You can have
the entire appetizer.

36:25.861 --> 36:28.064
They wired a million down.

36:29.132 --> 36:32.302
And I will get it to you
all in cash. All of it.

36:33.103 --> 36:36.206
Excellent.

36:36.339 --> 36:37.706
Tell me something.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.344
Will you torture this Becker the
way you do all your customers?

36:41.478 --> 36:43.980
As usual, I will squeeze
more money out of him

36:44.114 --> 36:46.149
than he expects to pay.

36:46.283 --> 36:50.086
And we'll both benefit
from the extra cash, colonel.

36:52.022 --> 36:53.390
<i>Salud,</i> colonel.

36:54.957 --> 36:56.692
It's always a pleasure.

37:01.031 --> 37:02.432
Mr. Becker.

37:02.566 --> 37:04.700
You a narc or a spook?

37:10.307 --> 37:11.608
Narc.

37:11.740 --> 37:13.310
Sit down.

37:15.911 --> 37:17.947
- Do I know you?
- You should.

37:18.081 --> 37:19.683
We can help each other out.

37:19.815 --> 37:22.252
What if I don't need any help?

37:22.385 --> 37:24.321
Stark thought you might.

37:24.454 --> 37:27.390
I was told you have
a level-three clearance.

37:27.524 --> 37:29.959
You'd be a valuable asset to us.

37:30.093 --> 37:32.128
A lot of money passes
through those casinos.

37:32.262 --> 37:36.499
I need documentation,
and you're in a position to get it for me.

37:36.633 --> 37:38.301
What kind of documentation?

37:38.435 --> 37:40.570
Well, money is being
laundered in a massive scale

37:40.704 --> 37:42.372
through the casino.

37:42.505 --> 37:44.241
I need the cage reports.

37:44.374 --> 37:46.009
I need to know
where the money's going.

37:46.142 --> 37:48.222
Talking about drug money?
What are you talking about?

37:48.345 --> 37:50.080
Oh, whatever it is or it isn't,

37:50.213 --> 37:52.515
that's not important to me.

37:52.649 --> 37:55.918
Let the DEA arrest the drug dealers.
I thought that was the idea.

37:56.052 --> 37:58.121
We want evidence
incriminating noriega.

37:58.255 --> 38:01.458
The CIA is financing
the opposite ticket.

38:01.591 --> 38:03.759
They're pouring in $50 million.

38:03.892 --> 38:05.495
Isn't that against the rules?

38:05.629 --> 38:07.796
Meddling with another
country's election?

38:09.932 --> 38:14.271
My organization is working on
the other side of the equation.

38:14.404 --> 38:16.239
We're building evidence
against noriega.

38:16.373 --> 38:19.175
You were saying
how we can help each other.

38:19.309 --> 38:21.044
Doors will open.

38:21.177 --> 38:22.646
You can get me those reports,

38:22.778 --> 38:25.282
I can arrange for some
cash to find its way

38:25.415 --> 38:27.484
into an offshore account
of yours somewhere.

38:27.617 --> 38:31.254
- Tell me another way you can help me.
- We have resources.

38:31.388 --> 38:34.057
Some day you will need me.

38:41.197 --> 38:43.133
It seems to weigh just right.

38:46.536 --> 38:50.873
The serial number on the .45 is a code.
Memorize it.

38:51.007 --> 38:54.344
If you have a problem, call the
office, give the respondent the number,

38:54.477 --> 38:56.879
we'll provide you
with assistance.

38:58.481 --> 39:01.884
Cynthia.
Now you're being helpful.

39:38.288 --> 39:41.057
Take care of business.

39:41.191 --> 39:43.560
Hello.

39:59.309 --> 40:02.045
Enrique, I looked up
your gaming history.

40:02.178 --> 40:04.547
I gotta be honest.
You're a horrible gambler.

40:05.749 --> 40:08.351
- Surely that's not a complaint.
- Nah, nah, nah.

40:08.485 --> 40:11.521
I heard your drink of choice
is champagne. Is that right?

40:11.654 --> 40:13.556
- It is.
- Yeah?

40:13.690 --> 40:17.093
No champagne is complete
without some <i>chochas.</i>

40:17.227 --> 40:20.029
- Mm.
- I have a few waiting for me at the bar.

40:20.163 --> 40:22.365
Wanna join?

40:22.499 --> 40:23.899
Why not? Yeah.

40:25.301 --> 40:27.804
I will show you
a good time, Becker.

40:27.936 --> 40:31.141
And about the helicopter deal,
we can talk about it later.

40:32.475 --> 40:34.778
How come a guy like you
is here alone?

40:36.079 --> 40:39.416
Guess I'm waiting for a woman like you.

40:51.227 --> 40:54.364
<i>Camila. One in a million.</i>

41:03.206 --> 41:05.108
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.

41:06.743 --> 41:08.611
That one
you don't wanna mess with.

41:09.813 --> 41:12.482
- She's dangerous.
- How so?

41:12.615 --> 41:15.685
She's connected
to the wrong people.

41:15.819 --> 41:18.721
You know, Enrique, you like
living dangerously, don't you?

41:18.855 --> 41:20.323
- Always.
- Yeah.

41:20.457 --> 41:22.125
Makes you feel alive, right?

41:22.258 --> 41:23.726
- Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

41:23.860 --> 41:26.129
So, let me live.

41:52.255 --> 41:54.123
I'm Becker. What's your name?

41:55.225 --> 41:56.426
You're drunk.

41:56.559 --> 41:58.428
Hmm. Yeah.

41:58.561 --> 42:00.396
But I ain't fucking blind.

42:01.731 --> 42:04.267
You know, you sure
are beautiful.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.838
And you are a handsome man,
but you're still drunk.

42:08.972 --> 42:11.808
Yeah, well, that can be
rectified, you know.

42:14.777 --> 42:16.012
Don't bother.

42:16.913 --> 42:18.181
I'll ruin your life.

42:18.314 --> 42:20.450
It's already ruined.

42:23.086 --> 42:27.557
You are <i>UN poquito loco.</i>

42:27.690 --> 42:29.459
Yeah, that is true.

42:30.927 --> 42:34.731
If you want a sane man,
you got Enrique over there.

42:38.268 --> 42:40.403
Now, there you are wrong.

42:41.404 --> 42:44.307
He's definitely not sane.

42:46.910 --> 42:49.679
But at least he's smart
enough to not hit on me.

42:51.447 --> 42:54.183
Well, I guess
maybe I'm stupid then.

42:58.022 --> 43:00.056
- Yes, you are.
- Yeah.

43:01.090 --> 43:03.226
I like stupid men.

43:03.359 --> 43:05.194
- As long as they are rich.
- Oh, shit.

43:05.328 --> 43:06.963
Now we're getting
somewhere, baby.

43:23.047 --> 43:24.280
Well...

43:26.816 --> 43:27.850
Well what?

43:29.019 --> 43:31.087
Shall we go to bed?

43:42.365 --> 43:44.300
Damn, you are sexy.

43:44.434 --> 43:46.402
Shh.

43:46.536 --> 43:49.606
It's only gonna work out
if you don't talk, okay?

44:01.818 --> 44:06.155
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down.

45:37.081 --> 45:38.414
Ready for this one?

45:43.519 --> 45:45.254
Yes! Whoo!

45:47.057 --> 45:48.291
Whoo!

45:49.093 --> 45:51.561
When I win, everybody wins.

45:51.694 --> 45:54.464
And to make this evening
more interesting...

45:55.865 --> 45:57.000
I'm all in.

45:58.334 --> 46:00.003
- You roll, my dear.
- Really?

46:00.137 --> 46:01.704
Yeah.

46:10.580 --> 46:12.182
Excellent.

46:12.315 --> 46:16.220
Whoo! So now that I ran out of
chips, we can go back to the bar.

46:16.352 --> 46:17.720
Huh? You ready for that?

46:17.854 --> 46:19.022
Yes? Come on.

46:23.127 --> 46:26.429
Sex for me helps
to keep my demons away.

46:27.964 --> 46:29.966
- Sex and alcohol.
- Mm.

46:31.334 --> 46:33.269
Show me your arm.

46:34.504 --> 46:36.240
Is that one of your demons?

46:36.372 --> 46:38.208
A gang back in Colombia.

46:38.341 --> 46:40.476
Well, you done with all that?

46:42.645 --> 46:44.413
That's why I move here.

46:45.414 --> 46:47.950
I used to dream, you know.

46:48.085 --> 46:51.287
I had lots of dreams.

46:53.056 --> 46:54.290
About what?

46:55.958 --> 46:57.060
About...

46:58.828 --> 47:00.763
Running away with someone.

47:04.001 --> 47:05.368
Someone special.

47:06.136 --> 47:08.304
Oh, yeah? What happened?

47:08.437 --> 47:12.475
When I was 14,
I was purchased by my <i>patrÃ³n.</i>

47:13.876 --> 47:16.746
I actually wanted to be sold.

47:17.981 --> 47:19.816
Couldn't wait.

47:19.949 --> 47:25.088
Because... anything was better
than how I was living.

47:26.789 --> 47:29.259
My father ripped me from home

47:29.392 --> 47:31.561
and just gave me away

47:31.694 --> 47:35.431
in an exchange for two
cows and 500 pesos.

47:36.732 --> 47:39.468
That's horrible.

47:41.071 --> 47:44.208
That was a long time ago.
Don't worry.

47:44.340 --> 47:49.645
I have learned to survive
by my wits and my body.

47:51.914 --> 47:54.517
My looks are just
a commodity to me.

47:55.551 --> 47:57.054
To be bought and sold.

48:02.692 --> 48:04.427
A question for you.

48:05.895 --> 48:07.998
Am I gonna get a bill for this?

48:08.131 --> 48:11.767
I knew you would ask that.

48:15.838 --> 48:18.008
It's my day off.

48:18.141 --> 48:19.609
Shit.

48:19.742 --> 48:23.113
Baby, I could run away with you.
You know that?

48:23.247 --> 48:25.681
You don't want to get
to know me first?

48:40.763 --> 48:42.665
Shouldn't you get that?

48:50.007 --> 48:52.508
Ready? Yes?

48:53.277 --> 48:55.411
Becker!

48:56.879 --> 49:00.384
I heard you ride motorcycles.
Is that true?

49:00.516 --> 49:02.185
A little bit. Yeah.

49:02.319 --> 49:04.796
Well, I'm gonna give you the
thrill of your life in the morning.

49:04.820 --> 49:07.657
Since you insist on living dangerously.

49:08.591 --> 49:09.926
All right. See you then.

49:10.060 --> 49:13.096
Whoo!

49:47.730 --> 49:49.632
Hair of the dog, my friend.

49:50.833 --> 49:53.036
Today we test our skills.

49:54.137 --> 49:57.007
I have an obstacle course
cut into the jungle.

49:57.140 --> 49:58.808
Let's see if you can
keep up with me.

49:58.941 --> 50:01.877
I'm not into dirt bikes.
I'm more into cruisers.

50:02.012 --> 50:05.881
You Americans and the harleys.

50:06.016 --> 50:08.385
I would fall asleep
in one of those.

50:08.517 --> 50:11.221
Real men go off road.

50:11.355 --> 50:15.993
Listen, if you win,
you keep this helicopter.

50:16.126 --> 50:19.862
If you don't,
I'll sell it to someone else.

50:20.563 --> 50:22.165
Deal?

50:38.382 --> 50:42.285
<i>Drug dealers love the
natural stuff, too... adrenaline.</i>

50:42.419 --> 50:45.621
<i>Never met one who wasn't
a complete fucking nutjob.</i>

53:15.971 --> 53:18.908
Don't feel so badly, seÃ±or.

53:19.042 --> 53:21.444
No one has ever lasted
as long as you have.

53:22.646 --> 53:25.048
We're gonna be
good friends, you and I.

53:36.792 --> 53:39.296
Nope.
No, on the right side. Yeah.

53:39.429 --> 53:41.864
- Oh, fuck.
- Sorry.

53:43.099 --> 53:44.668
Enrique's an arrogant prick.

53:44.800 --> 53:47.703
Yeah, but that son of a bitch
can ride a dirt bike though.

53:55.711 --> 53:56.946
Hello.

53:59.882 --> 54:02.319
Fucking asshole. Goddamn.

54:15.398 --> 54:19.236
<i>- DÃ³nde estÃ¡ Enrique?
- En El cuarto.</i>

54:19.369 --> 54:20.403
Yeah.

54:21.638 --> 54:23.607
Enrique.

54:23.739 --> 54:26.459
- Enrique, hey.
- It's only 10:00. Grab one of these beautiful women.

54:26.543 --> 54:28.645
You need to adjust
your fucking business hours.

54:34.584 --> 54:36.386
Would you like one?

54:36.519 --> 54:38.887
- No, no, I'm good.
- Glenmorangie.

54:39.022 --> 54:40.290
Eighteen year old.

54:40.423 --> 54:41.458
Single malt.

54:42.626 --> 54:43.626
Mm.

54:46.029 --> 54:47.697
So, what can I do for you?

54:47.830 --> 54:51.434
My understanding is they're
selling the helo to another buyer.

54:51.568 --> 54:52.435
Is that right?

54:52.569 --> 54:53.769
- Yes.
- Why?

54:53.902 --> 54:57.507
Because you lost
the motorcycle race, Becker.

54:57.641 --> 54:59.576
Fuck you.

54:59.709 --> 55:01.344
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

55:01.478 --> 55:03.879
We paid you a million
dollars in advance,

55:04.014 --> 55:05.415
and you cashed the fucking wire.

55:05.548 --> 55:07.584
Now, I'd like
the money back, please.

55:07.717 --> 55:10.420
That was
a nonrefundable deposit.

55:10.553 --> 55:12.622
Enrique, I don't do
nonrefundable.

55:12.756 --> 55:14.190
I'm asking ya nicely, kid.

55:14.324 --> 55:17.994
And they say good manners
don't cost anything, right?

55:18.128 --> 55:21.364
Okay, look. Let me make it
real fucking simple for you.

55:22.599 --> 55:27.270
You either give me the
money or I'll take it.

55:27.404 --> 55:31.341
Your whores down in the
casino, they got loose lips.

55:31.474 --> 55:35.578
I know you got the money in here,
so show me where the fuck it is.

55:54.331 --> 55:56.433
<i>Yeah, he had it
in a fucking speaker.</i>

55:56.566 --> 55:59.369
<i>I used to hide</i> playboys
<i>in a speaker when I was ten.</i>

55:59.502 --> 56:02.238
- There's your fucking money.
- Good.

56:02.372 --> 56:05.275
Good. Now you can go
back to your fucking siesta.

56:12.115 --> 56:14.351
I hope you know
what you're doing.

56:20.256 --> 56:21.857
We continue the struggle.

56:32.736 --> 56:35.605
- Anything you need, <i>jefe?</i>
- No, Pablo.

56:35.739 --> 56:37.073
How's your beautiful family?

56:37.207 --> 56:39.409
Oh, they are <i>muy bien.</i>

56:39.542 --> 56:41.177
I love them so much.

56:41.311 --> 56:43.146
Well, I want you to go home.

56:43.279 --> 56:45.515
I don't need you until tomorrow.
All right?

56:48.351 --> 56:50.153
Whatever you say. Thank you.

56:50.286 --> 56:54.023
Thank you.

57:14.477 --> 57:17.614
- Now, what's this?
- It's evidence. Cage reports.

57:17.747 --> 57:19.182
It's what you wanted, right?

57:19.315 --> 57:21.394
It's exactly what I wanted.
So, what can I do for you?

57:21.418 --> 57:24.888
I need you to get Enrique to sell me the
helicopter for the price we agreed upon.

57:25.021 --> 57:27.956
Why would I play a card for a
business deal that means nothing?

57:28.091 --> 57:30.160
It's not nothing.

57:30.293 --> 57:33.472
If you don't help me, then I'm just gonna
raise some old-fashioned fucking revenge.

57:33.496 --> 57:35.899
- You hear me?
- Oh, my god. Get over it, Becker.

57:36.032 --> 57:37.500
Okay? There's
a shitstorm coming,

57:37.634 --> 57:40.503
and your helicopter deal
is just one of its casualties.

57:41.204 --> 57:43.273
Don't do anything stupid.

57:43.406 --> 57:46.209
<i>To defend democracy in Panama,</i>

57:46.342 --> 57:48.611
<i>to combat drug trafficking</i>

57:48.745 --> 57:53.016
<i>and to protect the integrity
of the Panama canal treaty.</i>

57:53.149 --> 57:56.186
<i>Many attempts have been made
to resolve this crisis</i>

57:56.319 --> 57:59.722
<i>through diplomacy
and negotiation,</i>

57:59.856 --> 58:03.726
<i>to urge general noriega
to honor the clear results...</i>

58:03.860 --> 58:05.695
Jesus Christ, what a mess.

58:10.400 --> 58:12.702
I'm gonna take the call
in the bedroom, all right?

58:12.836 --> 58:15.839
Wish you would take me in the bedroom.

58:15.971 --> 58:19.209
After this call,
I'll take you on the couch.

58:19.342 --> 58:21.778
Promise?

58:24.547 --> 58:28.084
<i>I understand that Carlos and...</i>

58:34.357 --> 58:37.427
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, how's our boy scout doing down there?</i>

58:37.560 --> 58:40.330
- Getting pretty wild, huh?
- It is.

58:40.463 --> 58:43.032
- Did you hear our chopper deal went south?
- <i>Yeah, I did.</i>

58:43.166 --> 58:45.368
- Well, I got the million.
- <i>Hey, good man.</i>

58:45.502 --> 58:47.370
Panama's about to explode.

58:47.504 --> 58:49.984
I wouldn't be surprised if we
invade, the way things are going.

58:50.106 --> 58:53.276
I hope you let me know if they start
dropping fucking bombs down here.

58:53.409 --> 58:55.411
Yeah, I'll give you
a heads up on that one.

58:55.545 --> 58:59.148
Listen, Becker.
The favor you asked of the DEA?

58:59.282 --> 59:00.583
I get it.

59:00.717 --> 59:04.587
But stand down. Enrique
will be dealt with, okay?

59:04.721 --> 59:07.357
Stark, there's good people down
here that need that chopper.

59:07.490 --> 59:08.958
Yeah, I know, I know.

59:09.092 --> 59:12.529
We'll help them when we can,
but now is not the time.

59:12.662 --> 59:16.733
- Sir, this is the reason why I hate this business.
- <i>I understand.</i>

59:16.866 --> 59:20.069
But the best I can do right now is
get you a big, fat Christmas bonus

59:20.203 --> 59:22.438
for putting up with the
bullshit, all right?

59:29.913 --> 59:31.548
So...

59:31.681 --> 59:34.717
You were saying something
about the couch?

59:36.052 --> 59:37.587
I believe we were, yeah.

59:37.720 --> 59:39.155
Yes?

01:00:03.013 --> 01:00:05.114
Enrique. Join us.

01:00:05.248 --> 01:00:06.482
Santos.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.355
Been worried.

01:00:13.222 --> 01:00:14.357
My uncle was attacked.

01:00:16.359 --> 01:00:18.261
Nothing to worry about.

01:00:18.394 --> 01:00:20.196
He's in good health.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.265
Pure theatrics, <i>mi chiquillo.</i>

01:00:22.398 --> 01:00:25.301
A public relations stunt
planned well in advance.

01:00:25.435 --> 01:00:28.571
Your <i>tÃ­o</i> is now a national hero.

01:00:28.705 --> 01:00:30.540
My idea.

01:00:31.407 --> 01:00:34.577
Why? I don't understand.

01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:37.113
Endara and my uncle
are the opposition.

01:00:37.246 --> 01:00:40.817
If they come to power,
they will not act in your interest.

01:00:42.086 --> 01:00:43.286
My friend,

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.824
the prudent action on my part
is to bet on both outcomes.

01:00:47.957 --> 01:00:50.793
Both outcomes?

01:00:51.494 --> 01:00:52.997
Okay.

01:00:53.129 --> 01:00:57.233
If america invades,
endara and your uncle take power.

01:00:57.367 --> 01:01:01.237
If they don't, noriega remains.

01:01:02.472 --> 01:01:05.341
Either way, I win.

01:01:05.475 --> 01:01:07.977
I staged this event with the
cooperation of your uncle

01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:09.545
and his advisers.

01:01:09.679 --> 01:01:12.215
You see, we need
blood in the streets

01:01:12.348 --> 01:01:14.350
if we want to provoke
an invasion.

01:01:16.953 --> 01:01:19.622
Meanwhile, we need
to clean up loose ends.

01:01:21.224 --> 01:01:22.258
Cordoza, for once.

01:01:22.392 --> 01:01:24.360
He knows too much.

01:01:24.494 --> 01:01:26.696
And your American friend,
in particular.

01:01:28.965 --> 01:01:30.566
I rather like Becker.

01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:34.804
Don't get sentimental.

01:01:35.605 --> 01:01:37.273
He's tied in with cordoza.

01:01:37.407 --> 01:01:40.010
He works at the casino.

01:01:40.144 --> 01:01:43.613
We don't know what he knows
or who he talks to.

01:01:45.983 --> 01:01:47.817
You can't trust Americans.

01:01:48.484 --> 01:01:50.386
He took my money.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.257
So get rid of him
and anyone else close to him

01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:57.593
and get my million dollar back.

01:01:59.395 --> 01:02:03.666
<i>And just like that,
the colonel wanted everyone dead.</i>

01:03:21.444 --> 01:03:23.913
<i>Americano.</i> Becker.

01:03:33.023 --> 01:03:34.957
The big corporate news networks
are reporting

01:03:35.092 --> 01:03:37.060
the casualties are less
than a hundred people,

01:03:37.194 --> 01:03:39.462
but that simply isn't true.

01:03:39.595 --> 01:03:42.232
There are scores of Panamanians
out there dead,

01:03:42.365 --> 01:03:44.734
and there are more desperately
seeking medical attention.

01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:47.370
<i>And the government?</i>

01:03:47.503 --> 01:03:51.440
The government have closed down all
access to the hospitals. All of them.

01:03:51.574 --> 01:03:53.609
<i>This is an emergency situation,</i>

01:03:53.743 --> 01:03:55.645
and you need to leave
immediately.

01:03:55.778 --> 01:03:57.880
So who can I count on?

01:04:22.505 --> 01:04:23.739
Oh, yeah.

01:04:40.823 --> 01:04:44.094
- Where are you going?
- I need a smoke.

01:04:49.299 --> 01:04:52.401
Bring it back to bed, baby.

01:04:54.037 --> 01:04:58.474
You're not a human. You're a sex machine.

01:04:58.608 --> 01:05:00.776
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:14.824
Let me get a puff of
that, will ya?

01:05:19.862 --> 01:05:21.631
All yours.

01:05:21.764 --> 01:05:23.866
Where are you going?

01:05:25.068 --> 01:05:27.070
- I'm going to pour us a drink.
- Mm.

01:05:35.112 --> 01:05:36.445
Camila?

01:06:01.038 --> 01:06:03.040
Fuck!

01:06:15.484 --> 01:06:17.553
If you don't tell me
who sent you,

01:06:17.687 --> 01:06:19.722
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:06:19.855 --> 01:06:22.458
- Fuck you.
- <i>Ingles, no?</i>

01:06:23.193 --> 01:06:24.227
Okay.

01:06:25.228 --> 01:06:26.462
You know what?

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:29.865
Here's the thing about torture.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.003
It's sometimes
the most effective way.

01:06:33.136 --> 01:06:36.340
It's the simplest.

01:06:36.472 --> 01:06:37.673
Who fucking sent you?

01:06:37.807 --> 01:06:40.676
Enrique! Enrique Rodriguez.

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.678
Enrique?

01:06:43.512 --> 01:06:44.747
Yeah.

01:06:45.681 --> 01:06:46.916
Really?

01:07:01.664 --> 01:07:04.967
D-9-1-o-4-0-5.

01:07:09.939 --> 01:07:12.275
Hello?

01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:15.878
I got a couple bodies at Camila's
apartment. They need to be picked up.

01:07:16.013 --> 01:07:18.781
- Which apartment?
- What do you mean, what apartment?

01:07:18.914 --> 01:07:22.585
She has two. One she lives in
and one she entertains in.

01:07:24.488 --> 01:07:26.956
Well, I guess I'm in
the one that entertains.

01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:31.161
She has another one
in punta paitilla.

01:07:31.294 --> 01:07:33.163
<i>You want the address?</i>

01:08:02.392 --> 01:08:03.994
You look startled.

01:08:05.594 --> 01:08:07.397
Thank god you're alive.

01:08:09.099 --> 01:08:11.934
It's amazing how you can
just turn it on like that.

01:08:14.804 --> 01:08:16.139
I mean it.

01:08:22.678 --> 01:08:24.413
Ask me if I set you up.

01:08:24.548 --> 01:08:27.551
Okay. Did you?

01:08:27.683 --> 01:08:28.917
Yes.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:33.356
The Colombians,
they threatened to kill my family.

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:37.227
It was either you or them, and I will
make the same choice again if I have to.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:38.727
I'm not buying that story.

01:08:57.645 --> 01:08:59.615
I don't have a family, Camila.

01:09:05.754 --> 01:09:07.157
<i>What a dumb-ass.</i>

01:09:07.957 --> 01:09:09.692
<i>But aren't we all?</i>

01:09:32.381 --> 01:09:33.716
Amigo.

01:09:33.849 --> 01:09:35.951
Amigos don't try
to kill each other.

01:09:49.566 --> 01:09:50.600
Are you mad at me?

01:09:50.733 --> 01:09:52.602
I know it wasn't your orders.

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:54.604
Thank you for understanding.

01:09:54.737 --> 01:09:57.307
You see, this is just business.

01:09:58.608 --> 01:10:02.112
Your country's military will have
secured Panama in a few hours.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.484
And then they will swear in
Guillermo endara as president

01:10:07.617 --> 01:10:09.986
and my uncle as vice president.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.355
You're uncle's a crook, Enrique.

01:10:12.489 --> 01:10:14.690
He's a politician.

01:10:14.823 --> 01:10:16.193
I choose the good life.

01:10:16.326 --> 01:10:18.995
The booze, cash.

01:10:19.828 --> 01:10:21.064
The pussy.

01:10:24.401 --> 01:10:25.801
Come here, honey.

01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:28.904
See that?

01:10:29.039 --> 01:10:33.009
That's a man's morality,
my friend.

01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:36.079
The only god.

01:10:37.547 --> 01:10:39.715
The resurrection and life.

01:10:39.848 --> 01:10:42.352
Our refuge and strength.

01:10:42.485 --> 01:10:44.887
Tell you something, my friend.
Get out of here.

01:10:50.393 --> 01:10:55.599
If you wanna live in the
definition of your morality,

01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:59.802
then you're gonna tell me
who tried to fucking kill me.

01:11:03.506 --> 01:11:06.276
- Can't do that.
- Yeah, no, you're gonna do it.

01:11:08.844 --> 01:11:10.779
You wanna die, Enrique?

01:11:10.913 --> 01:11:13.383
- We're amigos.
- Nah.

01:11:14.217 --> 01:11:16.152
You contradicted yourself.

01:11:16.286 --> 01:11:19.089
Sometimes amigos
do kill each other.

01:11:30.567 --> 01:11:32.202
Colonel justines.

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:37.340
Marcos justines.

01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:40.176
Thanks, amigo.

01:12:11.807 --> 01:12:13.176
<i>Enrique?</i>

01:12:15.612 --> 01:12:16.980
Colonel justines.

01:12:18.748 --> 01:12:19.983
I, uh...

01:12:22.585 --> 01:12:25.021
I believe I have
bad news for you.

01:12:25.789 --> 01:12:27.023
<i>Becker's still alive.</i>

01:12:28.692 --> 01:12:29.793
<i>He was here.</i>

01:12:29.925 --> 01:12:32.429
And somehow he knew that...

01:12:36.232 --> 01:12:38.101
He knew that you, uh...

01:12:39.336 --> 01:12:41.137
You ordered me
to have him killed.

01:12:42.105 --> 01:12:43.506
No worries, <i>mi chico.</i>

01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:45.974
I'll handle seÃ±or Becker.

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.244
<i>Come see me.</i>

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.115
Let's have coffee.

01:13:16.606 --> 01:13:17.607
SeÃ±or burns.

01:13:18.641 --> 01:13:20.610
Enrique failed.
No surprise there.

01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:25.615
<i>But it presents an excellent
opportunity for us to do business.</i>

01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:27.183
I'm all ears, colonel.

01:13:27.317 --> 01:13:30.953
<i>Your compadre, Becker,
has stolen from me.</i>

01:13:31.087 --> 01:13:33.323
It's front money from stark.

01:13:34.124 --> 01:13:35.958
One million.

01:13:36.092 --> 01:13:38.261
I would like you to retrieve it.

01:13:38.395 --> 01:13:42.098
Upon your success,
we will do the usual split.

01:13:42.232 --> 01:13:44.868
I appreciate
the opportunity, colonel,

01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:46.669
but 50/50
won't cut it this time.

01:13:49.038 --> 01:13:53.276
Okay. You keep the money.
All of it.

01:13:54.878 --> 01:13:58.114
But remember, you're in Panama.

01:13:58.248 --> 01:14:00.583
I'm in charge
of the police and the army.

01:14:00.717 --> 01:14:03.987
<i>Are you certain you don't
want some political cover</i>

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.555
<i>for this caper of yours?</i>

01:14:06.456 --> 01:14:08.358
Standard split after expenses.

01:14:09.359 --> 01:14:11.594
We know one
of Becker's weak points.

01:14:11.728 --> 01:14:12.928
She's in Panama.

01:14:13.062 --> 01:14:15.665
<i>Good. Good then.</i>

01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:18.067
After you retrieve my cash,

01:14:19.169 --> 01:14:21.771
drive to your <i>finka</i>
outside David.

01:14:21.905 --> 01:14:24.674
<i>I'll send my man there
in a couple of days.</i>

01:15:09.118 --> 01:15:10.987
<i>Not only
do they want to kill me,</i>

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.698
they want the fucking
million dollars back.

01:15:12.722 --> 01:15:15.492
- That's why they tore the place apart.
- They get it?

01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:18.094
No, no, no. I hid it in a
place they'll never find it.

01:15:18.228 --> 01:15:20.263
Listen, Panama's
getting out of hand.

01:15:20.396 --> 01:15:22.131
They won't stop
looking for that money.

01:15:22.265 --> 01:15:25.835
It's your call. You want to get out
of there and come back stateside?

01:15:25.969 --> 01:15:27.804
Not yet, stark.

01:15:27.937 --> 01:15:30.507
Okay. Stay in touch.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.774
I'm on my way.

01:15:34.143 --> 01:15:37.347
<i>Okay,
this is where I come in to clean it up.</i>

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.134
Camila?

01:15:58.935 --> 01:16:00.270
Fuck. Hey.

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.238
Honey. Hey.

01:16:03.907 --> 01:16:06.042
Oh, fuck.

01:18:24.447 --> 01:18:27.750
When your father passed,
you were still a baby.

01:18:27.884 --> 01:18:31.487
I tried to step in to fill
that void left by your father.

01:18:33.256 --> 01:18:35.925
But so often
I feel I have failed.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.293
No, colonel.

01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:40.064
You were always there for me.

01:18:40.196 --> 01:18:41.999
I was so proud of you.

01:18:42.132 --> 01:18:44.767
I was so proud of your
academic achievement.

01:18:45.635 --> 01:18:47.704
Graduating cum laude at Harvard.

01:18:49.006 --> 01:18:50.473
Getting your mba.

01:18:51.474 --> 01:18:53.943
What happened?

01:18:55.179 --> 01:18:57.847
My mother died.
It proved that life was like a candle

01:18:57.981 --> 01:18:59.615
lit in an empty hallway.

01:19:00.249 --> 01:19:02.585
She was a Saint,

01:19:02.719 --> 01:19:06.289
and god took her like
she was <i>cualquier persona.</i>

01:19:06.422 --> 01:19:10.326
How did Becker find out it
was me who ordered him killed?

01:19:16.399 --> 01:19:17.633
I don't know.

01:19:18.601 --> 01:19:20.436
Don't lie to me.

01:19:26.009 --> 01:19:27.243
I'm sorry.

01:19:32.615 --> 01:19:34.450
You are out of control.

01:19:35.818 --> 01:19:37.754
Thank goodness you have no wife.

01:19:39.022 --> 01:19:40.256
No babies.

01:19:48.999 --> 01:19:50.466
Why, colonel?

01:19:51.601 --> 01:19:53.237
I will never talk.

01:20:06.449 --> 01:20:08.718
What was in the coffee?

01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:11.487
Something to make this go easy.

01:20:12.755 --> 01:20:14.390
I can't move my arms.

01:20:28.971 --> 01:20:31.175
You're a good boy.

01:20:31.307 --> 01:20:33.876
This is bigger than just you and me.

01:20:35.545 --> 01:20:37.880
I will miss you.

01:20:49.392 --> 01:20:54.463
I will revere this spot
in the garden... forever.

01:21:35.938 --> 01:21:38.741
Does it make you feel
good to kill a woman?

01:21:39.976 --> 01:21:40.976
Hmm?

01:21:41.044 --> 01:21:42.845
SeÃ±or Becker, I presume.

01:21:44.982 --> 01:21:47.084
I'm gonna make you
fucking suffer.

01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:50.988
Okay.

01:21:58.594 --> 01:22:00.496
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:03.233
I'm afraid this is a
standoff, don't you think?

01:22:04.334 --> 01:22:06.769
We both have weapons
pointed at each other.

01:22:09.172 --> 01:22:12.575
I think you should
calm yourself, seÃ±or.

01:22:14.111 --> 01:22:18.748
Now... I'm going to make a call.

01:22:18.881 --> 01:22:23.586
The person at the other end
may help you understand, okay?

01:22:25.155 --> 01:22:26.189
Okay.

01:22:37.234 --> 01:22:41.271
It seems killing seÃ±or Becker
just makes him more angry.

01:22:42.306 --> 01:22:45.975
He's here, and he has
a gun pointed at me.

01:22:46.776 --> 01:22:48.844
Perhaps you should talk to him.

01:22:50.846 --> 01:22:52.581
- Put it down.
- Sure.

01:22:53.616 --> 01:22:55.185
Please.

01:23:06.096 --> 01:23:07.397
Who is this?

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:10.167
<i>Everyone you ever care
about seems to die, Becker.</i>

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.101
Burns?

01:23:11.234 --> 01:23:13.003
Your wife Sarah.

01:23:13.136 --> 01:23:14.704
You motherfucker, you.

01:23:15.504 --> 01:23:16.739
Camila.

01:23:17.773 --> 01:23:19.076
And now tatyana.

01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:21.144
What are you talking about?

01:23:23.846 --> 01:23:25.048
Becker.

01:23:25.182 --> 01:23:26.016
Tatyana?

01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:29.119
What's going on?

01:23:29.252 --> 01:23:30.653
<i>Tatyana?</i>

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:36.293
But you have a chance, Becker.
A chance to save her.

01:23:36.426 --> 01:23:37.793
You piece of shit.

01:23:39.929 --> 01:23:42.498
We will arrange a trade.

01:23:43.733 --> 01:23:46.069
Give me the million dollars
you stole from me,

01:23:46.936 --> 01:23:48.005
and you get her back.

01:23:48.138 --> 01:23:50.806
- Yeah.
- Alive and in one piece.

01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:08.258
The fuck's going on?

01:24:08.392 --> 01:24:11.028
- You tell burns to let her go.
- Let who go?

01:24:11.161 --> 01:24:12.462
Tatyana!

01:24:12.595 --> 01:24:14.131
Your sister-in-law.
What about her?

01:24:14.264 --> 01:24:15.831
Listen to me, John.

01:24:15.965 --> 01:24:19.136
He's asking me to give
justines the million dollars

01:24:19.269 --> 01:24:21.071
- or he's gonna kill her.
- Shit.

01:24:21.204 --> 01:24:23.340
- What the fuck is she doing here?
- I don't know.

01:24:23.473 --> 01:24:25.641
My advice? Pay the man.

01:24:25.775 --> 01:24:27.010
- Pay him?
- Yeah.

01:24:27.144 --> 01:24:29.079
That's it? Come on.
Let me kill him, John.

01:24:29.212 --> 01:24:32.615
No. Arrange the trade, get her back.
Take care of him later.

01:24:32.748 --> 01:24:35.751
- I don't trust him.
- He's an untrustworthy motherfucker.

01:24:35.885 --> 01:24:37.686
You're gonna need backup.
I'm going with ya.

01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.023
- Last time you were in the field?
- A long time ago.

01:24:40.157 --> 01:24:41.525
I'm rusty.

01:24:52.202 --> 01:24:54.304
You wanna be the bait
or the hook?

01:24:55.671 --> 01:24:58.075
I suppose it is my turn.

01:25:16.059 --> 01:25:18.727
Make sure you hit him in the head.

01:25:18.861 --> 01:25:20.663
I was talking to myself.

01:25:21.597 --> 01:25:24.534
Make sure you break his neck

01:25:24.667 --> 01:25:25.668
after you stick him.

01:25:26.936 --> 01:25:28.971
Drop it. Cool.

01:25:39.715 --> 01:25:41.118
Been keeping an eye on us.

01:26:21.957 --> 01:26:23.757
Stark will take you
somewhere safe, all right?

01:26:23.826 --> 01:26:26.029
I'm glad you're in one piece.
Nice to see ya again.

01:26:26.163 --> 01:26:28.697
Well,
it's nice to be seen again.

01:26:28.831 --> 01:26:31.368
You got a sense of
humor about it. That's good.

01:26:31.501 --> 01:26:32.735
You'll survive.

01:26:33.903 --> 01:26:35.704
Want some chocolate?

01:26:39.509 --> 01:26:42.045
<i>Rumor surfaced that
burns had been double dealing</i>

01:26:42.179 --> 01:26:44.047
<i>with the CIA payments,</i>

01:26:44.181 --> 01:26:48.151
<i>so their command has been tapping
his phones for the last six months.</i>

01:26:48.285 --> 01:26:51.154
<i>Apparently, he's very tight
with justines.</i>

01:26:51.288 --> 01:26:55.358
<i>Burns is heading for justines'
ranch outside of chiriqui tomorrow.</i>

01:26:55.492 --> 01:26:57.793
There's a safe house about
500 yards from the ranch.

01:26:57.927 --> 01:26:59.895
He's driving,
you're flying on a small plane.

01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:03.233
One of my guys will pick you up in
chiriqui, take you to the <i>finka.</i>

01:27:03.366 --> 01:27:06.902
I'll arrange for security
to take the night off.

01:27:07.037 --> 01:27:09.005
Rest is up to you.

01:27:09.139 --> 01:27:11.074
I'll get the job done.

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:15.478
<i>This detail is essential.</i>

01:27:15.612 --> 01:27:18.481
<i>After you get our money back,
turn the lights on.</i>

01:27:18.615 --> 01:27:20.916
<i>Ask burns to leave
the way he came in.</i>

01:27:21.051 --> 01:27:24.187
<i>Wait 20 minutes,
then head to the airport.</i>

01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:26.822
<i>There'll be another plane
ready to take you back.</i>

01:27:38.068 --> 01:27:39.402
Mr. Burns.

01:27:40.537 --> 01:27:41.770
Sit.

01:27:42.706 --> 01:27:44.441
I've positioned a chair for you.

01:27:47.177 --> 01:27:49.012
You armed?

01:27:50.247 --> 01:27:53.450
No, but my driver is.
He's in the car.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:00.023
With your left arm,
swing the bag in front of your chair.

01:28:06.596 --> 01:28:10.833
Good. Now with your right
leg, push it towards me.

01:28:16.439 --> 01:28:18.874
Now, as much
as I'd like to kill you,

01:28:20.076 --> 01:28:22.878
I've been ordered
to let you go, so go.

01:28:31.354 --> 01:28:34.357
Oh, and, Mr. Burns,
one last thing.

01:28:34.491 --> 01:28:37.994
If I ever see you again,
you're dead.

01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:01.384
Nice.

01:29:02.352 --> 01:29:04.621
- Should we bag justines?
- Not our unit.

01:29:04.754 --> 01:29:08.491
Your DEA friend has got all
the information you gave her.

01:29:08.625 --> 01:29:11.494
She'll give it to Panama.
Let them juggle the turds.

01:29:11.628 --> 01:29:13.697
Well, shit. Let's go find
a bottle of whiskey then.

01:29:13.829 --> 01:29:17.334
No, no, no. Not so fast. First you
gotta deliver that chopper to muller.

01:29:17.467 --> 01:29:19.835
Then it's happy hour.

01:29:19.968 --> 01:29:22.205
After I deliver the bird,

01:29:23.139 --> 01:29:24.774
I'm going on vacation, John.

01:29:24.907 --> 01:29:26.209
Well, good.

01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:28.111
Good man.

01:29:29.512 --> 01:29:31.414
I have a question for you, John.

01:29:33.216 --> 01:29:34.984
Do you believe in redemption?

01:29:36.252 --> 01:29:37.287
Hmm.

01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:39.622
The question's flawed.

01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:44.427
Redemption implies that we've
committed some kind of sin

01:29:44.561 --> 01:29:48.031
and that there's some kind of
higher power that can absolve us.

01:29:49.132 --> 01:29:51.267
Both notions I reject.

01:29:55.171 --> 01:29:57.173
It's important
you forgive yourself.

01:30:03.113 --> 01:30:04.347
I'll see you, brother.

01:30:04.848 --> 01:30:06.082
See ya, buddy.

01:30:14.691 --> 01:30:16.393
I gotta clean this shit up.

01:30:29.272 --> 01:30:31.541
<i>Muller finally got his chopper.</i>

01:30:31.674 --> 01:30:33.143
<i>He never killed noriega with it.</i>

01:30:33.276 --> 01:30:36.279
<i>Matter of fact,
he never killed anyone with it.</i>

01:30:36.413 --> 01:30:40.683
<i>He took the high road.
Rescued 200 families instead.</i>

01:30:40.817 --> 01:30:43.052
<i>I think he'd finally seen
enough killing.</i>

01:31:16.419 --> 01:31:18.922
<i>We caught noriega
with his drawers down.</i>

01:31:19.055 --> 01:31:22.926
<i>Seized a shit ton of cocaine,
cash and crown royal.</i>

01:31:23.059 --> 01:31:26.729
<i>Well, the crown royal
didn't make it too far.</i>

01:31:31.434 --> 01:31:34.237
<i>And as you see, Becker
finally got that vacation.</i>

01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:37.207
<i>Romantic walks on the beach,
all by himself.</i>

01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:39.542
<i>Just another jerk in the surf.</i>
