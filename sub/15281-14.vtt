00:00.500 --> 00:01.760
E back in miami.

00:01.830 --> 00:03.860
Welcome,friends. Jim nance 
along with phil simms.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.160
Super bowl xli is in the books,

00:06.240 --> 00:08.710
and,phil,as you look back on it now,
what was the turning point?

00:08.770 --> 00:12.130
Well,like most games,jim,especially 
super bowls,it's about turnovers.

00:12.190 --> 00:13.660
That's what happened here today.

00:13.670 --> 00:15.070
But when I talk about turnovers,

00:15.070 --> 00:16.850
I have a different take on it.

00:16.910 --> 00:18.470
I look at it as takeaways.

00:18.550 --> 00:20.820
The winning team is always the most physical.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.810
They hit the opposing quarterback,they make him throw interceptions,

00:23.880 --> 00:25.760
they hit the running back extra hard--

00:25.830 --> 00:28.340
well,football is over until next year.

00:28.420 --> 00:32.140
Oh,which means I get sundays with my husband back.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.370
I already miss it.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.220
Hey!

00:34.410 --> 00:36.710
Oh,no,you didn't!

00:36.760 --> 00:38.690
Oh! No,no,no.

00:38.750 --> 00:39.760
I didn't mean it that way.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.210
Well,then--then how did you mean it?

00:41.290 --> 00:43.270
Just that I'll miss the,uh-- I don't know.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.570
No,no,don't do it.

00:44.640 --> 00:48.500
Just beg for her forgiveness and move on!

00:56.460 --> 00:58.500
Captioning made possible by touchstone television productions,llc and cbs oh,that is so wrong!

00:58.560 --> 00:59.590
Do you count what he drinks?

00:59.660 --> 01:01.330
Yeah,sometimes.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.910
Do you count my-- my beers?

01:02.990 --> 01:05.069
What?

01:09.810 --> 01:11.220
I don't want to do this.

01:11.290 --> 01:12.770
The others are leaving now.

01:12.830 --> 01:15.120
Go around back.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.950
Well,get home safe,you guys.

01:29.010 --> 01:31.190
Oh,don't worry,I'm driving.

01:38.270 --> 01:39.940
Didn't men use to the bosses?

01:39.990 --> 01:41.100
Hey,I'm already in trouble.

01:41.170 --> 01:41.890
Yeah.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.590
Smart boy.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.860
Bye,you guys.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.840
Good night.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.550
Ah.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.590
Can we let this wait till morning?

01:59.660 --> 02:00.940
No,let's just do a little.

02:01.000 --> 02:01.930
Come on.

02:01.930 --> 02:03.390
All right. I'm gonna take the garbage out.

02:03.460 --> 02:06.210
Ok.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.550
Honey,did you leave the back door open?

02:10.620 --> 02:11.800
What?

02:11.890 --> 02:14.580
Nothing,never mind.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.470
Hey,lena can finish the rest.

02:35.550 --> 02:38.430
Lena can barely finish what she has to do on a normal monday.

02:38.510 --> 02:39.780
Come on,I want to go to bed.

02:39.870 --> 02:40.830
Oh,dennis!

02:40.890 --> 02:42.860
Hey,i know how I can make up that horrible comment to you.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.610
You are kidding me,right?

02:44.660 --> 02:46.300
We can start on that special sunday together.

02:46.370 --> 02:50.120
No,well,I could get you a football helmet that you could make out with.

02:50.190 --> 02:53.750
Oh,that's ridiculous.

02:53.850 --> 02:56.260
Come with me.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.820
I love it when you drink.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.590
A glass of champagne?

03:12.290 --> 03:14.350
9-1-1,what's your emergency?

03:14.410 --> 03:17.060
I'm at 1527 chestnut drive.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.060
I know where you're calling fro calling from.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.240
What's the emergency?

03:19.290 --> 03:21.030
He thinks they're too greedy.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.330
They have too much.

03:22.380 --> 03:23.230
Too much what?

03:23.300 --> 03:25.220
Stuff,you know,possessions.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.870
Things they don't need. Hurry!

03:26.930 --> 03:29.620
You're calling because these people have too much stuff?

03:29.670 --> 03:31.590
No,I'm calling because raphael--

03:31.640 --> 03:32.860
That's enough.

03:32.940 --> 03:36.980
I know why he's calling,because raphael is going to kill the sinners that live here.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.790
I'm sorry,did you say someone is killing somebody?

03:39.790 --> 03:41.730
sir? hello?

03:57.590 --> 03:59.260
face forward and be careful!

03:59.340 --> 04:01.090
Want to look back and check your wallet.

04:01.170 --> 04:04.150
It's all right,I'll be a broke,happy man.

04:07.690 --> 04:08.890
Cheers!

04:08.960 --> 04:11.390
Cheers!

04:11.460 --> 04:13.780
How are they treating you at the B.A.U.,Emily?

04:13.850 --> 04:16.000
She means,am I being nice to you?

04:16.050 --> 04:19.290
Actually,everyone has been incredibly nice.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.890
Look at him move.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.380
it's like a cat.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.010
More like a dog!

04:26.070 --> 04:27.780
He did not ask them to dance.

04:27.870 --> 04:29.390
They asked him.

04:29.450 --> 04:30.820
Ok.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.440
Ok,he's a cat.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.340
An alley cat.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.160
Come on,haley,let's go show them how it's done.

04:35.200 --> 04:35.800
Oh!

04:35.870 --> 04:38.250
Game if you are!

04:38.330 --> 04:40.160
Push it to the limit that is so sweet.

04:40.220 --> 04:41.450
I'm going to the loo.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.190
Do not let anyone steal my seat.

04:43.190 --> 04:45.440
XXXXXXXXXX

04:49.120 --> 04:50.360
oh!

04:50.420 --> 04:51.880
Another perfect toss!

04:51.930 --> 04:53.720
How did you get so good at this?

04:53.760 --> 04:56.030
Where I grew up,darts was like a national sport.

04:56.080 --> 04:56.970
Seriously?

04:57.010 --> 04:59.280
Yeah,we were too small for a bowling alley.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.110
Ah.

05:03.010 --> 05:04.280
Oh!

05:04.340 --> 05:07.650
Sorry,boys,you're gonna have to find someone else to humiliate you.

05:07.710 --> 05:08.740
Oh,ok.

05:10.930 --> 05:12.660
XXXXXXXXX

05:12.750 --> 05:14.310
return to tomorrow.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.580
Return to tomorrow,season 2,production number 51,

05:16.580 --> 05:19.250
an alien entity,sargon,takes over kirk's body 

05:19.250 --> 05:21.900
while 2 others kick over spock and dr. Mulhall.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.490
Alien race or terran?

05:23.550 --> 05:24.150
Trick question.

05:24.210 --> 05:25.090
A race is never identified.

05:25.130 --> 05:27.070
Sargon is a disembodied mind.

05:27.070 --> 05:29.950
What did dr. Mccoy quote?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.150
5...

05:34.250 --> 05:35.260
4...

05:35.320 --> 05:36.140
3...

05:36.190 --> 05:37.620
2...

05:37.680 --> 05:39.870
"I will not peddle flesh.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.300
I'm a physician.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.790
" Drink!

05:42.790 --> 05:43.780
I'm sorry.

05:43.830 --> 05:46.610
Will you say that again?

05:47.520 --> 05:48.980
Ok.

05:49.040 --> 05:53.930
Um,have the police fax over everything they have so far.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.580
I'll take care of the notifications,most everyone's here with me.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.950
Thank you.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.100
WASHINGTON D.C
The Smithsonian Institude

06:07.240 --> 06:12.500
Last,but not least,a special treat for your annual super bowl visit.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.700
Something new?

06:13.760 --> 06:18.130
As soon as it came in,I knew you'd want to see it.

06:20.110 --> 06:25.860
An original hand-colored audubon etching entitled turdus polyglottus.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.440
Or the mockingbird.

06:27.490 --> 06:29.690
It's gorgeous.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.390
See how they fight the rattlesnake for their nest?

06:32.430 --> 06:34.800
They have no concern for their own safety.

06:34.850 --> 06:36.430
I can see why you'd be drawn to it.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.650
You know,they can emulate the cries of over 30 different species,

06:40.720 --> 06:45.100
from hummingbirds to eagles,other animals,

06:45.150 --> 06:46.760
even machinery.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.320
They are incredible.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.180
J.J.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.820
I'll meet you at the office.

06:58.870 --> 07:00.900
Rattlesnake in someone's nest?

07:00.960 --> 07:02.650
I'm sorry we couldn't spend more time together.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.630
Thanks a lot.

07:12.900 --> 07:20.250
What did we do? ...

07:43.430 --> 07:45.390
It was redemption.

07:45.430 --> 07:49.290
It wasn't god's breath...

07:53.170 --> 07:57.720
What did we do?

08:08.310 --> 08:09.520
You know,it never fails.

08:09.570 --> 08:12.480
Just as I'm getting my groove thing going,bam.

08:12.540 --> 08:13.710
We're back at the B.A.U.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.120
You know,statistically a case doesn't come in with any more frequency

08:16.180 --> 08:18.090
if you're at a party or a gathering and if you aren'T.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.180
It's a trick of the mind.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.320
We merely remember the ones that came in that way more.

08:21.380 --> 08:25.970
So is it really that hard for you to get your groove "thang" going again?

08:26.030 --> 08:27.710
Only when he's sleeping.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.940
Where were you tonight?

08:28.990 --> 08:30.710
I told you,I went to the smithsonian.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.039
You missed a good time.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.460
I had a good time.

08:33.490 --> 08:36.460
Well,that's definitely over.

08:36.510 --> 08:37.669
Georgia.

08:37.730 --> 08:41.370
The kyles dennis and lacy were murdered an hour ago in their suburban atlanta home.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.400
An hour ago?

08:42.440 --> 08:44.080
Police were on scene unusually fast.

08:44.130 --> 08:44.890
Why?

08:44.920 --> 08:49.040
One of the unsubs called them and told them that the other was about to mder the victims.

08:49.090 --> 08:49.910
You're kidding.

08:49.950 --> 08:51.200
From inside the house.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.640
According to the dispatcher,

08:52.700 --> 08:55.510
the first male sounded terrified and begged them to get there before the other,

08:55.570 --> 08:58.640
who they both identified as raphael,

08:58.690 --> 09:00.660
was about to kill the sinners that lived there.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.690
Sinners?

09:01.740 --> 09:04.210
The 9-1-1 center is going to send garcia a copy of the tape.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.900
How fast was the police response time?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.690
4 minutes,26 seconds.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.470
During which time...

09:09.510 --> 09:11.650
raphael managed to do this.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.500
In 4 1/2 minutes?

09:13.500 --> 09:15.530
Mr. Kyle is a dot com millionaire.

09:15.580 --> 09:18.110
His company is one of the largest employers in the community.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.750
There's gonna be media coverage.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.380
Also,when they arrived,

09:21.430 --> 09:24.820
the police found this displayed prominently on the bed.

09:24.870 --> 09:26.460
Revelations chapter 6,erse 8.

09:26.510 --> 09:27.780
They're killing sinners.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.010
These guys are on a mission.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.840
And mission-based killers will not stop killing.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.680
And I looked in behold a pale horse,

09:34.720 --> 09:38.280
and his name that sat upon m was death.

09:38.340 --> 09:41.400
And hell followed with him.

09:44.580 --> 09:45.710
This isn't right.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.100
Ye shall walk after the lord,your god,

09:48.160 --> 09:52.560
and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice,

09:52.610 --> 09:54.070
and you shall serve him,

09:54.100 --> 09:56.160
and cleave unto him.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.510
You don't serve god that way.

09:59.530 --> 10:03.820
You don't question me,boy!

10:04.720 --> 10:07.450
Clean yourself up and quit whining.

10:07.490 --> 10:11.420
You done the lord's work today.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.970
Hey!

10:34.680 --> 10:37.480
No,PLEASE!

10:40.630 --> 10:43.690
Now you stay right there.

10:45.620 --> 10:50.880
Book tells us that we ain't to serve the lord until we are sealed,boy.

10:54.020 --> 10:57.160
Sealed with god's mark.

10:57.230 --> 11:01.320
Sealed in our forehead.

Condemned murderer perry smith said of his victims,the clutter family,

12:18.280 --> 12:21.870
I didn't have anything against them,and they never did anything wrong to me,

12:21.920 --> 12:24.460
the way other people have all my life.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.070
Maybe they're just the ones who have to pay for it.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.480
This is a bad one,isn't it?

12:34.540 --> 12:36.120
Unsubs with a cause are never good.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.750
Pets,I just got the 9-1-1 call from the georgia state police.

12:39.770 --> 12:41.590
9-1-1,what's your emergency?

12:41.640 --> 12:44.180
I'm at 1527 chestnut drive.

12:44.210 --> 12:45.260
I know where you're calling fro calling from.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.470
What's the emergency?

12:46.520 --> 12:48.270
He thinks they're too greedy.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.590
They have too much.

12:49.610 --> 12:50.550
Too much what?

12:50.580 --> 12:53.760
Stuff,you know,possessions. Things they don't need. 

12:53.800 --> 12:54.360
Hurry!

12:54.400 --> 12:56.470
You're calling because these people have too much stuff?

12:56.510 --> 12:58.800
No,I'm calling because raphael--

12:58.820 --> 12:59.790
That's enough.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.990
I know why he's calling,because raphael is going to kill the sinners that live here.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.050
I'm sorry,did you say someone is killing somebody?

13:07.110 --> 13:09.010
Well,unsub one definitely sounds frightened.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.840
Maybe he's doing this against his will.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.790
I doubt it.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.610
He whispered.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.250
He could have called out to save them instead of calling 9-1-1.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.630
Not if he had a gun to his head.

13:17.670 --> 13:20.250
If he had a gun to his head,why would he have dialed 9-1-1?

13:20.280 --> 13:23.750
The second unsub said raphael was going to kill someone.

13:23.810 --> 13:24.810
Is there a third?

13:24.860 --> 13:27.720
Referring to oneself in the third person is not uncommon for an unsub.

13:27.770 --> 13:30.160
Ted bundy gave thoroughly detailed accounts of his murders,

13:30.190 --> 13:32.130
but he never actually admitted to doing it.

13:32.180 --> 13:33.210
He would just say,"the killer.

13:33.250 --> 13:36.050
Ok,so I'm gonna go ahead and the name raphael 

13:36.130 --> 13:38.310
through the georgia criminal databases as well as our own.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.390
Thanks,garcia.

13:39.430 --> 13:41.670
Ever so welcome,my liege.

13:41.690 --> 13:44.190
We have a killing team on a mission in rural georgia.

13:44.260 --> 13:45.190
We know what that means.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.040
They're not gonna stop until the mission's complete.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.100
We need to hit the ground running.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.020
J.J.,We need an inside picture of the victims.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.630
Victimology can be critically important in a mission-based spree.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.000
Already on it.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.190
Prentiss,go where the bodies are.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.380
Examine the wounds.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.490
They managed to kill 2 victims in 4 1/2 minutes.

13:58.490 --> 14:00.190
- You got it.
- We need to know how.

14:00.190 --> 14:03.450
I'm gonna set up at the atlanta field office and go over case files from the state.

14:03.490 --> 14:06.350
It would be highly unusual for a first kill to be this efficient.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.110
Reid,you and morgan,come with me to the crime scene.

14:09.180 --> 14:13.100
We land in less than an hour. Everybody try to get some rest.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.060
You all right?

14:23.100 --> 14:24.660
What?

14:24.700 --> 14:25.880
You seem unhappy.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.620
I am unhappy.

14:27.660 --> 14:31.070
Tired of people using religion to 

14:31.120 --> 14:33.400
justify the terrible things they do.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.180
You're saying these killers are on a mission?

14:35.220 --> 14:37.450
These unsubs believe they're either on a mission from god 

14:37.510 --> 14:39.480
or that the bible was somehow guiding them.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.560
Unsubs?

14:40.620 --> 14:42.230
That stands for unknown subjects.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.310
The killers,working as a team.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.140
It sounded to me like only one of them was into the mission.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.060
It's usually more complicated than even that.

14:49.090 --> 14:51.080
In the case of dick hickock and perry smith,

14:51.120 --> 14:52.990
perry was the subservient personality.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.990
Basically against even entering the clutter home,

14:55.030 --> 14:59.390
and yet he was the one who almost single-handedly slaughtered the entire family.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.950
Huh.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.530
How many times was mr. Kyle stabbed?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.090
Stabbed...

15:05.130 --> 15:07.330
isn't exactly the word.

15:07.380 --> 15:10.210
They're all long,deep gashes.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.970
Each victim has virtually the same wounds--

15:13.030 --> 15:17.750
 both throats cut,a vertical gash up one arm from wrist to elbow,

15:17.790 --> 15:21.420
and a vertical gash down one leg from crotch to upper thigh.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.650
Major arteries.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.780
It's damned efficient.

15:24.830 --> 15:27.400
How much knowledge of anatomy would someone need to do this?

15:27.440 --> 15:30.870
Anyone with a basic understanding of the body knows where these arteries are.

15:30.920 --> 15:35.190
And do you have any idea which one of these wounds was delivered first?

15:35.240 --> 15:37.650
Um,there was a-- 

15:37.690 --> 15:40.070
there was active blood flow from each of the wounds,

15:40.100 --> 15:43.340
so they're probably all delivered at about the same time.

15:43.390 --> 15:44.640
With any of these wounds,

15:44.690 --> 15:46.340
the victim would bleed out quickly,

15:46.360 --> 15:49.780
almost like an animal at slaughter.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.470
No.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.680
Exactly like an animal at slaughter.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.310
A deer or a lamb or a cow,something like that.

15:57.350 --> 16:00.380
You--you cut the throat first,then--

16:00.430 --> 16:04.010
then sometimes open up other major arteries to assist in draining the carcass.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.240
So,maybe a hunter?

16:05.270 --> 16:09.090
Or a farmer.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.870
Pretty much anyone in rur georgia.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.740
Oh.

16:18.850 --> 16:20.780
So,I just talked to the gentries.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.940
They were the last couple to leave the super bowl party.

16:22.970 --> 16:25.020
According to them,the kyles didn't have any enemies.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.900
They were good to their employees,

16:26.950 --> 16:28.850
more generous then they needed to be.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.260
They were just generally good people.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.220
So why them?

16:32.260 --> 16:34.300
Well,if the trigger's greed,

16:34.330 --> 16:35.580
they do have a nice house.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.240
Yeah,but you can't tell that from the street.

16:37.290 --> 16:40.070
These people were chosen,and we need to know why and how.

16:40.110 --> 16:42.940
I pulled everything we have unsolved in the last 2 years.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.650
Nothing even close to the M.O.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.100
No murders involving a knife?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.950
We have a lot of open cases involving knives,

16:47.980 --> 16:50.740
but they're in common type crimes,bar fights,robberies.

16:50.770 --> 16:52.140
Well,this isn't their first contact.

16:52.190 --> 16:56.120
One of them has experience.

16:56.150 --> 16:58.770
Is it ok if I go through some of your case files?

16:58.770 --> 16:59.940
Fresh eyes.

16:59.970 --> 17:03.230
There's nothing there.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.960
Help me out,ok?

17:06.010 --> 17:08.730
These guys,they're not gonna let me do anything else,

17:08.770 --> 17:13.329
and I flew all the way here,so...

17:13.500 --> 17:17.079
I'll show you the file room.

17:22.329 --> 17:23.940
This is an unincorporated area.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.079
We're stretched pretty thin,manpower-wise.

17:26.109 --> 17:28.710
That's why we couldn't get here any faster after the guy called.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.700
4 1/2 minutes,that's a pretty good response time.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.680
Yeah,that's on par with new york city's response time.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.010
4.3 minutes.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.850
And they've got a hell of a lot more cops per capita.

17:35.890 --> 17:37.610
This unsub was good.

17:37.650 --> 17:38.930
You didn't really have a chance.

17:38.950 --> 17:42.140
Ok,I know my partner called 9-1-1.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.090
The police are on the way,so I don't have a lot of time.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.490
Now,assuming unsub one didn't actively participate,

17:47.530 --> 17:51.590
I gotta believe I entered the bedroom fr here.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.730
I see mr. Kyle on the other side of the bed.

17:53.750 --> 17:58.180
So I approach him.

17:58.220 --> 17:59.380
And I cut him first.

17:59.430 --> 18:00.430
Well,how do you know that?

18:00.450 --> 18:02.530
A blitz attacker neutralizes the greatest threat first.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.030
In this case,it would be the man.

18:04.070 --> 18:06.630
Plus a 9-1-1 call.

18:06.690 --> 18:08.070
Woman screamed.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.890
You can't scream with your throat cut.

18:09.930 --> 18:11.870
So mrs. Kyle sees her husband murdered.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.880
She runs back into the bathroom.

18:15.450 --> 18:18.330
Excuse me,man.

18:18.910 --> 18:20.930
She tries to close the door behind her.

18:20.980 --> 18:24.510
I force my way in.

18:25.590 --> 18:27.450
And I kill mrs. Kyle back here in the bathroom.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.650
We checked that smudge for prints.

18:29.690 --> 18:30.820
Nothing.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.880
Looks like he wore some gloves.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.180
Not with any pattern.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.430
Like latex maybe.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.360
That doesn't make any sense at all.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.190
It doesn't?

18:38.230 --> 18:39.610
Unsubs suffering from a psychopathy,

18:39.670 --> 18:41.330
a delusion,like a message from god,

18:41.380 --> 18:43.450
or what we could classify as being disorganized.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.560
They don't generally clean up after themselves.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.390
You know,maybe unsub one,the frightened one,made sure they didn'T.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.620
Yeah,talk to me,baby girl.

18:53.690 --> 18:54.940
Are you at the crime scene?

18:54.980 --> 18:55.600
Yep.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.950
Is there like a-- a burgundy settee against one wall?

19:00.520 --> 19:03.830
Um,if a settee is a little couch.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.010
Oh,my lord.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.650
What? What's wrong?

19:06.720 --> 19:09.700
I just got a viral video emailed to me by a friend.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.920
A viral what?

19:10.960 --> 19:13.970
It's a video that someone posted online that someone thinks is novel in some way,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.860
and so they send it to everyone on their email lists,

19:15.890 --> 19:17.540
and so on and so on.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.990
This one seems to be pretty popular judging by the string of names on the forward.

19:21.050 --> 19:22.830
Garcia,is there some point to all of this?

19:22.860 --> 19:24.850
Yeah,I'm pretty sure it's a video of your crime scene.

19:24.870 --> 19:27.210
More specifically of your crime,most specifically of 

19:27.250 --> 19:29.080
mr. Kyle being murdered.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.580
Garcia,there's a video of this murder posted on the internet?

19:31.620 --> 19:32.730
Yeah.

19:32.770 --> 19:36.890
Shot from directly across the room from the...

19:36.930 --> 19:39.500
little couch.

20:08.670 --> 20:12.820
XXXXXXXXXX Of greed.

20:12.890 --> 20:14.440
Lust.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.390
Disease.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.460
That sounds like unsub number one.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.680
He says redemption must be sought.

20:19.730 --> 20:20.730
We must all repent.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.020
And he referred to being raphael?

20:23.050 --> 20:24.740
- It's not god.
- Or god.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.960
It's someone sitting right there next to him telling this guy what to say.

20:27.990 --> 20:32.200
- that's a new voice.
- As lord god spoke in leviticus

20:32.260 --> 20:34.520
- a third unsub?
- And if you will not yet for all this

20:34.580 --> 20:36.890
I will punish ye 7 times more for your sins.

20:36.930 --> 20:40.070
Could just be recorded from a religious program or sermon.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.040
Punish ye 7 times.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.470
5 more victims.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.830
These images were shot from the exact spot on the dresser where that computer sat.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.930
So,if this video came from that computer's camera,then what?

20:49.970 --> 20:51.830
Did the unsubs bring it with them?

20:51.870 --> 20:54.440
As far as we can tell,this computer belonged to the kyles.

20:54.490 --> 20:55.820
Garcia can do a better analysis,

20:55.870 --> 20:59.050
but it has their banking statements,vacation photos.

20:59.100 --> 21:01.620
One comes into the room and immediately goes after mr. Kyle.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.630
What,did the other unsub turn the camera on?

21:03.660 --> 21:05.520
We might be asking the wrong questions.

21:05.570 --> 21:07.640
This video,this message,it's important.

21:07.690 --> 21:09.530
Clearly they want the world to see this.

21:09.580 --> 21:10.840
They need it.

21:10.860 --> 21:19.610
But they didn't bring a camera with them.

21:19.740 --> 21:20.670
Agent franks?

21:20.700 --> 21:22.610
Does this building hav wireless internet?

21:22.640 --> 21:23.890
Yeah. Why?

21:23.940 --> 21:27.860
That camera's on right now.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.240
Did you see that,boy?

21:31.290 --> 21:32.750
What's going on?

21:32.790 --> 21:38.150
I told you,the armies of satan were gonna rise against us.

21:42.610 --> 21:43.920
The computer's connected itself to the internet.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.520
It's streaming a video feed somewhere.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.460
Can we trace this stream to the destination?

21:47.460 --> 21:48.910
Keep it open,garcia might be able--

21:54.400 --> 21:59.600
<font color=orange>the armies of satan shall not prevail</font >

21:59.830 --> 22:00.940
It turned off.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.010
So they're controlling it remotely?

22:03.010 --> 22:04.160
Is that even possible?

22:04.290 --> 22:06.770
Yeah,you can totally access someone's computer remotely.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.270
It's actually done a lot today.

22:08.270 --> 22:11.850
When a mortal calls for tech support,instead of like giving you instructions,

22:12.360 --> 22:14.480
the tech can work on your computer from wherever she is.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.980
And they maintain the access even after the work is done?

22:17.240 --> 22:17.910
They're not supposed to,

22:17.910 --> 22:20.600
but I suppose you could install a trojan horse during a service.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.640
Something left in the computer to be turned on later.

22:22.780 --> 22:25.030
Same way that websites get pop-up adds onto your computer.

22:25.030 --> 22:27.070
Garcia,can you check the kyles' phone records

22:27.070 --> 22:28.400
and see if they called for tech support in the last 6 months?

22:28.680 --> 22:29.240
Right-O.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.540
Oh,and if you get me the kyles' laptop,I can search the drive for anything implanted there.

22:32.540 --> 22:33.480
Fast as we can.

22:33.910 --> 22:34.940
By the way,this video,

22:35.660 --> 22:36.750
it's gone crazy viral.

22:36.750 --> 22:37.900
What does that mean?

22:37.900 --> 22:41.630
That means it's the most downloaded video on the entire internet,worldwide.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.180
And judging by the responses embedded in the files,

22:44.180 --> 22:45.860
people seem to think it's pretty cool.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.700
Call us if you find anything on the kyles' computer.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.120
Yeah.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.400
Murder as entertainment.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.470
They probably don't even realize it's real.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.420
People see so many images online every day,

22:56.420 --> 22:58.790
they might assume it's marketing for a horror film or something.

22:59.370 --> 23:00.830
The unsubs are right about one thing...

23:02.100 --> 23:03.850
the world is pretty screwed up.

23:20.920 --> 23:25.110
<font color=orange>It's Not Too Late!
Raphael's Punishment Has Begun</font >

23:31.840 --> 23:33.600
What?No!No!This is warning,not a show.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.770
What is wrong with you people--

23:43.730 --> 23:44.740
Tech support.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.730
Uh,I just got this computer yesterday and

23:48.280 --> 23:49.410
I can't seem to get the damn sound to work.

23:49.410 --> 23:50.770
All right,I think I can deal with that,sir.

23:50.770 --> 23:52.260
What kind of computer do you have?

23:52.260 --> 23:54.370
I don't know,big?

23:55.870 --> 23:58.950
I didn't mean the size,sir.I meant,do you have a P.C.?

23:59.760 --> 24:01.830
Um,my wife gave it to me for my birthday.

24:04.270 --> 24:06.130
Does your computer have a camera installed in it?

24:06.400 --> 24:07.080
I think so.

24:07.460 --> 24:10.180
But it's my sound that's messed up.

24:10.310 --> 24:11.490
All right,I can help you with that,sir.

24:11.490 --> 24:14.260
I'm gonna need you to allow me remote access to your computer.

24:14.660 --> 24:16.580
Ok,sure.Whatever that means.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.290
As long as it gets fixed.

24:20.890 --> 24:23.050
No.No,no,no,no,don't!

24:23.260 --> 24:25.870
-That whore!That jezebel!
-what

24:25.870 --> 24:26.960
What do you mean,no?

24:27.430 --> 24:28.930
No,she made a mistake.

24:30.110 --> 24:31.210
We don't have to--

24:31.650 --> 24:33.790
god is about love and forgiveness.

24:35.350 --> 24:38.110
What the hell do you know about god?

24:41.590 --> 24:42.840
So what have we got so far?

24:43.410 --> 24:45.170
Well,the killings are clinically efficient.

24:45.170 --> 24:47.840
They had the ear marks of a slaughter,as in an animal.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.180
Or a sacrifice.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.180
Haven't been able to find anything in federal or

24:51.180 --> 24:53.620
state databases that suggest similar crimes.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.780
As far as I can tell,it's the first in a series.

24:55.780 --> 24:59.100
At least one member of the team may believe he's killing in the name of god,

24:59.100 --> 25:02.540
suggesng a psychopathy that should display extreme levels disorganization.

25:02.970 --> 25:04.880
Yet there are forensic countermeasures

25:05.500 --> 25:08.120
and somebody in control enough to do complicated computer wk.

25:08.290 --> 25:10.700
One member of the team's organized,the other's extremely disorganized.

25:10.700 --> 25:13.710
But what's strange is that the one that we would consider as being most in control,

25:13.980 --> 25:15.080
the one that made the phone call,

25:15.080 --> 25:16.930
can't seem to stop the other one from killing.

25:17.330 --> 25:20.560
Usually the frenzied personality takes direction from the cooler head.

25:20.890 --> 25:22.190
All right,so let's look at that.

25:22.190 --> 25:24.070
Unsub one called the police before the killing,

25:24.070 --> 25:25.790
but he didn't leave time for him to get there.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.750
Is the phone call just a guy working on a defense in case of capture?

25:29.490 --> 25:30.970
I mean,maybe he didn't want to stop the other,

25:30.970 --> 25:32.790
but he did whatever he had to do to cover himself.

25:33.010 --> 25:34.150
So...

25:34.630 --> 25:36.230
what do we have so far?

25:38.910 --> 25:40.180
Not enough.

26:19.590 --> 26:21.280
9-1-1,what's your emergency?

26:22.340 --> 26:24.550
Behold,I will cast her into a bed,

26:25.220 --> 26:28.480
and then I commit adultery with her to bring tribulation.

26:29.920 --> 26:30.630
Excuse me?

26:30.630 --> 26:32.660
22 smith road.

26:33.160 --> 26:36.190
Raphael must teach more sinners the way of the lord.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.590
so,franks is right,none of the open knife cases fit.

26:53.290 --> 26:54.250
Tell me there's a but.

26:54.600 --> 26:55.940
Well,I looked at it a different way.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.140
I looked for unsolved home invasions.

26:58.520 --> 27:02.180
3 months ago,there was a prowler called in directly outside of the kyles' house.

27:02.180 --> 27:02.830
A prowler?

27:02.830 --> 27:05.270
The witness was walking his dog in a nearby park.

27:05.270 --> 27:06.070
Going back to his car,

27:06.070 --> 27:09.700
he saw a man in dark clothing go over the back wall and start sneaking up to the house.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.180
By the time the state police got there,prowler was gone.

27:12.300 --> 27:13.020
Only one man?

27:13.020 --> 27:13.960
Apparently.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.350
Was the witness able to describe him?

27:15.630 --> 27:17.500
If he did,it's not in this case file.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.190
Is there a name and address for the witness?

27:19.190 --> 27:20.440
Tobias hankle.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.610
Lives about an hour from here.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.860
It's a long shot,but he might be able to give us a description.

27:23.860 --> 27:24.880
Why don't you and reid go out there,

27:24.880 --> 27:27.390
see if you can find mr.Hankle and see if he remembers something.

27:27.660 --> 27:28.750
On it.

27:30.420 --> 27:31.380
-Agent hotchner.
-Yeah?

27:31.500 --> 27:33.270
State just responded to another murder.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.070
See if you can get the coroner out here right away.

27:36.070 --> 27:37.190
Detective.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.440
Yeah.Well,he called again.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.400
This time it was different.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.710
Only one of them spoke.

27:42.860 --> 27:43.850
Which one?

27:43.850 --> 27:45.150
Pretty sure it was raphael.

27:45.490 --> 27:46.540
I wrote down what he said,

27:46.870 --> 27:48.580
and I got a recording being brought out here.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.970
Took almost 11 minutes to respond.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.840
We only had but the one unit close.

27:52.840 --> 27:53.910
Could the unsub know that?

27:53.990 --> 27:57.690
Lack of police presence out here has gotten some local media attention recently.

27:57.690 --> 28:00.400
<font color=red>We're gonna eat our lunch over it now.不知道这句是哪来的</font >

28:00.930 --> 28:03.280
9-1-1 call wasn't the only thing that was different.

28:03.860 --> 28:06.690
This particular scene is weird in another way.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.360
The male victim,upstairs...

28:09.750 --> 28:11.190
throat cut.

28:12.180 --> 28:12.960
Why is that weird?

28:12.960 --> 28:14.110
He doesn't live here.

28:14.410 --> 28:15.670
He's a local handyman.

28:16.120 --> 28:16.810
Who lives here?

28:16.920 --> 28:19.440
The douglases.I just talked to mr.Douglas a little while ago.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.860
He's on his way back from a business meeting down state.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.170
And according to him,

28:23.320 --> 28:25.260
he wasn't having any handy work done on the house.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.370
And his wife was supposed to be home.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.410
But she's not?

28:28.410 --> 28:29.810
She seems to be missing.

28:30.020 --> 28:31.180
But her car is here.

28:31.180 --> 28:32.790
Keys,wallet,purse.

28:33.070 --> 28:34.660
I got a description out on the field.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.100
-So did you copy down what the caller said?
-Yeah.

28:40.530 --> 28:41.110
"Behold,

28:41.110 --> 28:43.110
I will cast her into a bed,

28:43.440 --> 28:45.550
and then that commit adultery."

28:46.480 --> 28:47.430
Oh.

28:47.430 --> 28:49.070
So adultery is the sin,

28:49.070 --> 28:51.380
but they kill him and not her.They abduct her.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.160
You think she's still alive?

28:53.160 --> 28:55.540
Well,we never assume otherwise unless there's evidence.

28:55.540 --> 28:56.940
"I will cast her into a bed."

28:58.590 --> 29:00.630
It's from revelation again.It's about jezebel.

29:01.920 --> 29:05.290
She was an adulterer,whore,false prophetess.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.100
She's the most reviled woman in the bible.

29:08.730 --> 29:10.450
The unsubs knew she was having an affair.

29:10.450 --> 29:11.750
There was a laptop here.

29:39.550 --> 29:41.550
Don't look now,but we're on candid camera.

29:43.330 --> 29:44.830
Uh-huh.

29:58.790 --> 29:59.720
Please!

29:59.720 --> 30:01.540
Tie her hands there and there.

30:01.540 --> 30:03.090
Please,don't hurt me!

30:03.700 --> 30:04.580
We don't have to do this.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.280
Tie her hands and shut up!

30:07.020 --> 30:08.150
Insolence!

30:08.330 --> 30:10.420
-I sometimes hate looking at my son!
-Please don't hurt me!

30:13.090 --> 30:15.170
There's a laptop set up on the dresser upstairs.

30:15.170 --> 30:16.590
With a pretty good view of the room.

30:16.850 --> 30:19.270
Garcia's trying to trace the camera's feed back to its destination.

30:24.720 --> 30:28.140
I gave her space to repent of her fornication,and she repented not.

30:28.140 --> 30:28.890
No,I do!

30:28.890 --> 30:30.260
I repent!

30:30.580 --> 30:31.740
Please!

30:32.050 --> 30:33.170
Look,she repents!

30:33.170 --> 30:35.670
It's in the book,luke 15:10,"I say unto you,there is joy "

30:36.160 --> 30:38.830
in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth."

30:38.830 --> 30:40.420
I'm sorry,I do!

30:40.420 --> 30:42.410
I repent.Please.

30:42.410 --> 30:43.620
Tape her mouth.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.970
So let's work this out.What does the new behavior tell us?

30:55.250 --> 30:57.110
That there was only one unsub this time?

30:57.110 --> 30:58.960
Uh,raphael?Alone?

30:58.960 --> 31:02.350
Not if he's the psychotic.He wouldn't be capable of operating this efficiently.

31:02.850 --> 31:04.590
Someone was here who could control himself.

31:04.590 --> 31:05.970
Make sure no evidence was left behind.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.470
At the first crime,unsub one called the police,right?

31:08.770 --> 31:10.190
This time it was raphael.Why?

31:11.750 --> 31:13.290
It's like the phone call is necessary.

31:13.950 --> 31:15.370
It's part of the signature.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.230
"Power was given unto them "over the fourth part of the earth.

31:21.970 --> 31:24.790
"To kill with sword,with hunger,and with death,

31:25.310 --> 31:27.170
and with the beasts of the earth."

31:27.510 --> 31:28.810
See anything new?

31:29.450 --> 31:32.130
-No.
-Revelations.

31:32.340 --> 31:34.250
Lot of bad stuff happens in that book.

31:34.850 --> 31:36.350
Phael called alone this time?

31:36.790 --> 31:37.750
Sounded like it.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.360
This thing doesn't act like anything we've ever seen.

31:41.410 --> 31:44.860
Someone's clearly a dominant personality and a clearly subservient one.

31:46.220 --> 31:48.650
They don't swing back and forth like this.

31:50.110 --> 31:52.340
Just don't take on each other's roles.

31:52.510 --> 31:53.600
Meaning?

31:53.600 --> 31:56.790
You know they can emulate the cries of over 30 different species?

31:57.130 --> 32:01.630
From hummingbirds to eagles,other animals,even machinery.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.560
Ever heard of the archangel raphael?

32:06.240 --> 32:08.020
God preached mercy for sinners.

32:08.290 --> 32:11.180
Don't you try to tell me about the lord,boy.

32:11.180 --> 32:12.880
Now you just get yourself in front of that camera,

32:13.500 --> 32:15.440
and make our message to the world.

32:21.270 --> 32:24.750
"Jezebel,which calleth herself a prophetess,"to teach and

32:24.750 --> 32:27.640
to seduce my servants to commit fornication.

32:29.790 --> 32:31.670
" Have we ever seen this in case history?

32:31.940 --> 32:34.630
A mixture of extreme psychosis in a controlled individual?No.

32:34.830 --> 32:37.590
One of the most common indicators of extreme psychosis is solitude.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.550
They don't exactly play well with others.

32:40.110 --> 32:43.160
Was garcia able to find anything on a raphael in the records?

32:43.160 --> 32:43.790
Not yet.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.180
So why is he naming himself?

32:45.810 --> 32:47.460
Twice?

32:47.460 --> 32:49.750
Certainly not worried about us getting that name.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.370
In fact,he wants us to know it.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.870
An alias?

32:54.490 --> 32:56.430
Or raphael doesn't actually exist.

32:56.690 --> 32:57.990
So we're not looking for a team?

32:58.490 --> 33:00.640
Raphael's the name of one of the archangels.

33:01.590 --> 33:02.720
Meaning?

33:02.720 --> 33:04.170
We may have one unsub,

33:04.650 --> 33:07.550
suffering from a delusion that he's actually an archangel.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.560
Maybe that first phone call was not 2 people,but one.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.000
What about the third voice?

33:12.250 --> 33:13.830
That I don't know about yet.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.800
If mrs.Douglas is jezebel,

33:16.260 --> 33:18.790
there is an especially unpleasant death in her future.

33:20.350 --> 33:21.540
"This is the word of the lord,

33:21.540 --> 33:22.800
"that he spake by his servant,

33:22.800 --> 33:24.420
"elijah,the tishbite,saying,

33:24.940 --> 33:28.800
in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel."

33:50.990 --> 33:53.490
Garcia's running voice analysis on the first 9-1-1 call to see

33:53.490 --> 33:54.960
if there are actually 2 voices.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.760
She's also going to peel the third voice off the videotape

33:56.760 --> 33:58.450
and see if that gets anything.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.600
We should have a copy of that latest call brought over here within the hour.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.440
Thanks.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.370
Hotchner.

34:03.370 --> 34:04.840
Your tip from chronicles is on the phone.

34:08.610 --> 34:09.219
Garcia.

34:09.219 --> 34:11.179
Jeez,don't you people answer your cell phones anymore?

34:11.520 --> 34:13.320
We were driving back to atlanta through the countryside.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.440
Spotty cell signal.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.000
If you think that first video went viral fast,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.770
the second one's going through the stratosphere.

34:18.030 --> 34:18.969
Second video?

34:19.360 --> 34:20.870
Yeah,there's a new video from our psycho.

34:20.870 --> 34:22.270
I'm downloading it myself right now.

34:23.210 --> 34:25.429
Some of these upload sites get more than a million hits a day.

34:26.310 --> 34:28.030
-Get it on the monitor here as soon as you can.
-Right.

34:43.370 --> 34:44.800
There isn't time,boy.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.270
No,no,daddy,I don't want--

34:46.270 --> 34:49.540
serving the lord ain't about what you want to do.

35:03.430 --> 35:06.660
Serving the lord is a duty.

35:15.290 --> 35:16.640
"That he spake by his servant,

35:16.650 --> 35:17.640
"elijah the tishbite,saying,

35:18.220 --> 35:20.910
in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel.

35:24.910 --> 35:27.090
Oh,my god.Oh,my god.Oh,my god.Oh,my god,no!

35:28.400 --> 35:29.560
Jezebel's death.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.270
My god.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.160
You can turn it off.

35:34.590 --> 35:35.850
Oh,wait.

35:35.850 --> 35:36.930
You hadn't seen enough?

35:37.090 --> 35:38.080
Those dogs.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.940
Those 3 dogs attacked someone a couple of months ago.

35:41.420 --> 35:42.350
I would have had them impounded,

35:42.350 --> 35:43.540
but the victim knew the owner.

35:43.870 --> 35:45.840
A neighbor.He didn't want to press charges.

35:46.340 --> 35:47.040
You sure?

35:47.040 --> 35:48.380
As god is my witness.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.390
3 mangy mixes.

36:06.820 --> 36:07.900
I knew those dogs looked sick.

36:08.270 --> 36:09.580
I called animal control,

36:09.580 --> 36:11.190
I don't know if they ever followed up on it.

36:11.380 --> 36:12.390
Here it is.

36:12.390 --> 36:13.340
You have the owner's name?

36:13.790 --> 36:14.690
-Hankle.
-Hankle?

36:14.690 --> 36:16.100
Tobias hankle.

36:17.890 --> 36:18.880
Hi,mr.Hankle?

36:19.860 --> 36:21.540
Um... yeah?

36:27.460 --> 36:28.720
Mr. Hankle?

36:28.720 --> 36:31.030
F.B.I.,I'm agent jareau,this is agent reid.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.020
F.B.I.?

36:33.020 --> 36:34.420
May we come in?

36:35.840 --> 36:41.040
Um... I'm sorry,I don't let anyone in the house.

36:41.270 --> 36:44.680
Actually,I,uh,really have to,um...

36:45.580 --> 36:47.210
you know,go?

36:47.650 --> 36:48.630
You do?

36:49.020 --> 36:49.810
For 30 minutes.

36:49.810 --> 36:51.210
Why didn't you say something in the car?

36:51.660 --> 36:52.890
Uh,do you mind?

36:52.930 --> 36:53.740
I'm sorry.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.090
My father doesn't like it.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.620
Your father?You're,like,30.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.160
At what age can one start disrespecting the wishes of their parents?

37:02.270 --> 37:04.760
You witnessed something a few months ago,

37:04.760 --> 37:06.400
that might be very helpful to us.

37:06.810 --> 37:07.760
I did?

37:07.760 --> 37:10.680
You saw someone go over a wall into a yard,you called the police?

37:11.740 --> 37:13.020
Me?

37:13.470 --> 37:14.920
You didn't?

37:15.420 --> 37:17.120
Sorry.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.760
Is there another tobias hankle here?

37:20.490 --> 37:22.830
Just me and my father.Charles.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.770
There's a report on file that lists you as calling 9-1-1.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.110
You were walking a dog.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.430
No,that's wrong,I don't have a dog.

37:30.090 --> 37:30.950
Oh.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.350
All right,well,sorry to bother you,sir.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.960
-Are you sure I can't just quickly use the
-sorry.

37:36.640 --> 37:37.760
Have a good night.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.640
That's weird.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.440
Why bother calling the police in the first place if later,

37:47.440 --> 37:49.320
you're just going to pretend you didn't?

37:50.550 --> 37:51.920
To gauge the response time.

37:52.050 --> 37:52.800
What?

37:52.870 --> 37:53.580
If you were going to kill somebody,

37:53.580 --> 37:54.820
but you wanted to call the police first,

37:54.820 --> 37:55.660
what would you need to know?

37:56.260 --> 37:57.760
How long it takes them to get there.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.210
Reid.

38:28.790 --> 38:30.000
J.J.!Get back here!

38:34.040 --> 38:35.220

38:44.980 --> 38:46.230
He's in here.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.380

38:47.380 --> 38:48.740
You ever seen me pull this thing out when I wasn't?

38:49.100 --> 38:50.300
Call hodges.

38:50.300 --> 38:51.120
We're in the middle of nowhere,reed.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.510
We have no cell service.

38:52.510 --> 38:53.940
Right.Of course we have no service.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.550
What do we do?

38:55.550 --> 38:56.810
I don't know.He's definitely in here.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.650
You cover the front,I'm gonna go around back.Hotch knows we came here.

39:00.850 --> 39:02.400
He'll come looking for us.We'll just wait him out.

39:02.750 --> 39:05.740
No,reid,are you sure we should

39:06.670 --> 39:07.960
split up?

39:20.480 --> 39:21.830
J.J.!

39:22.880 --> 39:23.970
J.J.,He's out back!

39:27.760 --> 39:29.370

39:31.320 --> 39:32.480
Reid?

39:39.330 --> 39:40.500
Reid.

39:52.810 --> 39:54.830
Why are you running from them devils,boy?

39:55.400 --> 39:56.300
They're F.B.I.

39:56.300 --> 39:57.340
They're devils!

39:58.040 --> 39:59.350
You're doing the lord's work.

39:59.350 --> 40:00.940
You got nothing to be afraid of!

40:19.870 --> 40:20.860
Reid!

40:20.860 --> 40:22.200
I don't wann do this anymore!

40:22.980 --> 40:25.300
Don't you disrespect me,boy.

40:25.790 --> 40:26.890
I'm sorry.

40:28.090 --> 40:29.220
You don't got no choices

40:29.880 --> 40:31.970
when the lord summons you to do his work.

40:31.970 --> 40:32.940
I'm sorry.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.680
I'm sorry.

41:13.010 --> 41:14.510
J.J.!

41:18.240 --> 41:19.480
Wait,wait,wait.

41:20.490 --> 41:21.690
I couldn't stop him by myself.

41:21.690 --> 41:23.100
Ok,ok.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.520
I tried to warn everyone.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.100
Just relax,mr.Hankle,all right?

41:26.100 --> 41:27.140
Shoot him!

41:27.610 --> 41:28.620
I don't want to!

41:30.050 --> 41:30.940
I said,

41:31.280 --> 41:33.930
shoot him,you weakling.He's a satan.

41:39.350 --> 41:40.620
He didn't do anything.

41:42.740 --> 41:44.770
I won't tell you another time,boy.

41:45.650 --> 41:47.000
Shoot him!
