02:04.880 --> 02:05.881
Report status.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.282
Captain, holding Russian <i>Akula</i>
at 400 yards.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.251
- Best bearing 0-3-5.
- We remain undetected, sir.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.443
Two hours, 45 minutes
in her baffles, Captain.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.363
We're right up lvan's ass,
and they don't even know it.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.407
Mind your panel.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.885
Conn, Captain. Maintain range.
Stay right behind her.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.286
Captain, explosion aboard the Konek.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.521
- Put it on the bearing.
- Yes, sir.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.922
They're going out
on their emergency distress pinger.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.767
Transmit two pings of active.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.966
- Let them know we're here.
- Hold up.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.122
What is that?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.041
Torpedo in the water
bearing 3-3-5 at 600 yards!

03:01.120 --> 03:03.691
Torpedo evasion. Make your depth 700 feet!

03:03.960 --> 03:05.200
- Was that from the Konek?
- No, sir.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.361
It's a contact directly above us.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.124
- 400 yards!
- All ahead flank!

03:08.200 --> 03:09.690
- Captain, there's no time.
- Two hundred yards!

03:09.760 --> 03:11.285
- Right hard rudder!
- Terminal homing!

03:25.760 --> 03:26.841
- Admiral.
- Captain.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.161
Tampa Bay's gone missing
just above the Kola Peninsula.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.810
NAVSEA reports no recent repairs,

03:30.880 --> 03:31.961
no problems with the radio

03:32.040 --> 03:33.804
and no weather over the Barents Sea.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.804
Awfully close to Russian waters.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.245
Yes, sir.
They've been playing cat and mouse

03:37.360 --> 03:38.486
with a Russian sub for weeks.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.324
Let's just hope that's all it is.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.689
Sir, they're two hours late for check-in.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.721
The hell we can't.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.529
We need to get back to Congress

03:48.600 --> 03:50.170
and twist some goddamn arms.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.049
An arms race in the Arctic, Charles?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.485
Oh, come on, it's a land grab.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.528
The Russian president is simply posturing,

03:55.600 --> 03:56.647
pounding his chest.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.370
He's embarrassed us in Syria.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.329
He continues to defy us in Crimea.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.243
Are we going to let him
dominate us in the Baltic?

04:02.320 --> 04:03.526
And what next, Europe?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.523
We can't afford another Cold War,

04:05.800 --> 04:06.642
neither can they.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.210
Isn't it true to say we are witnessing

04:08.280 --> 04:10.931
the most aggressive
military buildup in Russian history?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.329
It's not a time to pussy around.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.165
Sir, Tampa Bays gone missing
in the Barents Sea.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.721
We picked up a distress signal
above the Kola Peninsula.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.648
Hmm. That's Russia's back porch.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.008
There's classified systems on that boat.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.250
And 110 men, sir.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.366
Of course. Well, you wanna go quick,

04:43.440 --> 04:46.284
but you wanna go armed,
fast-attack submarine.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.169
I told the 6th Fleet
you'd want a hunter-killer.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.045
We don't have one in EUCOM region,

04:50.120 --> 04:51.645
not with a rescue-sub attachment.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.241
We do. We have one.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.602
No, son. Arkansas just lost her skipper.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.480
And I assigned her a new one.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.129
He's in the region, never been a captain.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.124
Joe Glass?

05:05.720 --> 05:06.926
Where the hell did you find him?

05:07.360 --> 05:08.361
What class was he?

05:09.040 --> 05:10.565
Never went to Annapolis, sir.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.807
Glass.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.611
<i>Stand by for secure transmission
from Fleet Forces Command.</i>

06:46.320 --> 06:47.321
Commander Glass?

06:48.760 --> 06:49.761
XO Brian Edwards.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.844
How was your trip in
from Portsmouth, Captain?

06:52.160 --> 06:54.367
Fast. What have you got there?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.724
Sealed orders from 6th Fleet.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.885
They're not wasting any time, sir.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.563
XO, recall the crew.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.366
We sail as soon as possible.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.123
Well, they've just been given
a two-day pass, sir.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.321
They'll be impossible to find.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.487
Impossible?

07:23.480 --> 07:24.402
Tell me something, XO.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.529
How many pubs are there in Faslane?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.202
Two.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.248
Then let's devise a radical plan.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.367
You look in one
and I'll look in the other.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.408
Aye, sir.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.601
Down, down.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.443
Opening hatch.
Tubes one and four operational.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.048
- Load torpedo tube one.
- Loading!

07:59.280 --> 08:01.487
Mother of Jesus,
we're packing a lot of heat.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.766
Yeah, why do you think
we need 'em all?

08:02.840 --> 08:05.605
- Captain's orders is all you need to know.
- I heard he was on the Baton Rouge.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.603
A wrench monkey.
Ain't never been a captain.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.523
I heard a rumor he punched
his commanding officer.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.968
Yeah, yeah. I heard he's all right.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.769
Always hitting the hottest
piece of ass in port,

08:13.840 --> 08:14.841
from here to Samoa.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.445
- Yeah? So, so he's one of us.
- What?

08:17.440 --> 08:19.488
When the hell have you ever hit
a hot piece of ass, Brickowski?

08:19.600 --> 08:20.806
When have you ever met

08:21.040 --> 08:22.405
- a captain who's one of us?
- Jackass.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.170
All right, settle down.
We've got some work to do.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.602
Carry on.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.401
Captain in control.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.602
Ship is rigged for dive,
Captain. No surface contacts.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.841
I intend to launch the ship.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.250
Arkansas is cleared
for passage, sir.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.441
Navigator Park.
Where are we headed, Captain?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.285
Warship Arkansas, this is
your captain, Joe Glass.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.883
<i>Now, I want to say that I knew
Commander O'Brian personally,</i>

09:35.960 --> 09:37.405
<i>and I know he trained you well.</i>

09:39.520 --> 09:40.760
<i>Now, I'm hearing a lot of chatter</i>

09:40.840 --> 09:42.171
<i>about the kind of captain that I might be,</i>

09:42.240 --> 09:43.366
<i>so let me tell you directly.</i>

09:44.080 --> 09:45.366
Not an Annapolis man,

09:45.480 --> 09:46.925
who learned who you are in a class.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.251
I've worked your jobs. Manned a sonar.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.244
Been the bull nuke.
I've cleaned torpedo tubes.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.524
If you think I know you better than your
previous officers, you're right.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.251
<i>I've been underwater all my life.</i>

10:00.760 --> 10:02.524
<i>I've missed five elections,
seven Super Bowls,</i>

10:02.600 --> 10:04.728
my sister's wedding,
and my father's death.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.045
This is all I know down here.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.402
I am you.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.841
If you think that means
I'm running anything other

10:14.920 --> 10:16.922
than the tightest ship you've
ever seen, you're dead wrong.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.364
It's not an idle training exercise.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.291
Your brothers on Tampa Bay
are missing in Russian waters.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.167
Possibly sunk.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.807
Every one of you knows
someone on board that sub.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.128
Now, we're gonna find them.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.001
So, follow orders.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.924
I expect nothing short of your best.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.806
I can do some of your jobs
better than you. I won't.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.961
They're your jobs...

10:48.160 --> 10:49.491
But they're my responsibility.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.961
Carry on, XO.

10:56.120 --> 10:56.962
Aye, sir.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.161
Admiral Fisk?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.642
Admiral Fisk.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.245
I'm briefing the president
in under an hour,

11:07.320 --> 11:08.651
and your Navy boys are not sharing.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.166
I work for the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs,

11:11.240 --> 11:12.685
not the NSA, Miss Norquist.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.569
Or are we on a first-name basis now?

11:16.720 --> 11:18.609
- Thing at my kid's school.
- Fair enough.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.565
IUSS picked up two explosions
off the Kola Peninsula,

11:21.640 --> 11:23.165
right where Tampa Bay went missing.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.649
- Two?
- Could be one of theirs,

11:25.720 --> 11:26.721
could be one of ours.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.449
Is there any chance that they collided?

11:29.640 --> 11:30.482
Not likely.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.770
Have you reached out
to your Russian counterparts?

11:32.840 --> 11:33.727
What do they say?

11:35.440 --> 11:36.441
That's classified.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.646
Now who's not sharing?

11:39.880 --> 11:41.370
What time were the explosions recorded?

11:41.840 --> 11:43.888
0904 and 0906 GMT.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.841
What's wrong?

11:51.880 --> 11:54.406
Ever since the Russians started
building up their fleet at Polyarny,

11:54.480 --> 11:56.289
we've been keeping tabs
on the Russian president.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.568
Zakarin left the Kremlin
with his core security,

11:58.640 --> 12:00.290
and he's headed right there
to the Kola Peninsula.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.646
- Sure, because of this incident.
- No.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.924
He left before the two explosions.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.121
A scheduled meeting
with his Defense Minister, Durov.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.721
I don't like coincidences.

12:09.800 --> 12:10.881
Well, I put a sub in the water.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.206
We'll have answers soon.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.442
Admiral.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.921
You're about two stars short of clearance
for what I'm about to tell you.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.689
I've been trying to get
the NSA to authorize an op,

12:29.760 --> 12:30.966
and they've been dragging their feet,

12:31.240 --> 12:33.129
and now everything is moving way too fast.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.842
If this was an act of aggression, we need
to know what Zakarin is doing there.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.922
If you want to fly a drone
into Russian airspace,

12:39.000 --> 12:40.001
- the Air Force will be happy to...
- No, no.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.561
Not from 60,000 feet.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.045
We need eyes and ears on the ground.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.205
I'm sure you know someone
who could go off-book

12:47.280 --> 12:48.361
for the next 48 hours.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.448
You want me to send a team into Russia?

12:55.080 --> 12:55.922
Yes, I do.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.361
Follow me!

13:06.400 --> 13:07.526
Move! Move! Move!

13:17.560 --> 13:18.402
Room clear!

13:19.280 --> 13:22.090
- You got 30 seconds, Martinelli!
- Moving!

13:22.160 --> 13:24.527
Move! Go! Move! Move! Move!

13:30.760 --> 13:31.921
Twenty seconds!

13:36.520 --> 13:37.362
Ten seconds!

13:40.320 --> 13:41.287
Five!

13:44.400 --> 13:45.242
Time!

13:47.080 --> 13:47.922
Hey!

13:49.040 --> 13:52.726
Congratulations, Martinelli,
you just killed the whole fucking team!

13:54.440 --> 13:55.282
Shit.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.724
Bag 'em, rack 'em,
and stack 'em, Martinelli.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.562
Damn it!

14:14.640 --> 14:16.563
Beaman ain't one
to hold back on his emotions.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.087
Irritation, anger, and rage.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.447
Hey, Commander,
isn't it past your bedtime?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.485
What's he so pissed off about
all the time?

14:25.560 --> 14:28.006
Well, maybe it's 'cause he's
from Birmingham. Ever been there?

14:28.080 --> 14:30.367
Hey, you know, I'm closing
on a house off East Lake Park.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.889
I don't suppose that's paperwork
you got in your hand.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.360
Looks like we're going ugly.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.641
How can you tell?

14:39.080 --> 14:40.286
Just look at Beaman.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.606
Son of a bitch is amused.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.601
It's a recon, boys.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.563
Stow all your simunitions
and training gear.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.768
- We're going live.
- Where we headed, boss?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.042
Come in.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.565
Crew's on board and ready to go, sir.

15:05.040 --> 15:05.882
Very well, Cob.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.365
I have something for you, Captain.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.566
I know supply's all out,

15:13.680 --> 15:17.127
but I thought you should have
one of your own before we get underway.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.130
I appreciate the gesture, Cob, but...

15:23.880 --> 15:24.881
But I can't take your coin.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.761
I don't think I'm gonna be buying anybody
a drink on this trip.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.127
Are you sure, sir?

15:31.960 --> 15:32.802
Yeah.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.126
I only got space
in this pocket for one coin.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.241
<i>You were on the Wichita.</i>

15:47.320 --> 15:48.526
My first boat.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.931
Was it as bad as they say, sir?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.561
I don't know what they say,

15:55.320 --> 15:56.606
but it was probably worse.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.528
That coin, my good luck charm.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.601
Only one I ever carry.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.160
Let's get underway.

16:11.080 --> 16:11.922
Aye, Captain.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.528
Reactors one and two
ready to go, sir.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.170
Last man down. Hatch secure.

16:50.840 --> 16:51.727
Captain in control.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.368
Officer of the deck, submerge the ship.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.726
Submerge the ship. Aye, Captain.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.769
Fifteen degree down bubble,
all ahead full.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.001
Make your depth 300 feet.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.247
Aye, sir.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.560
Depth set to 300 feet.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.005
Fifteen degrees down bubble.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.800
Dive! Dive!

18:29.680 --> 18:31.330
Welcome to Polyarny, Mr. President.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.562
Good to see you, Dmitri.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.923
- Has Washington made contact?
- They have.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.085
We thought it best to await your arrival
before responding.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.882
Okay. Let them wait.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.526
Short and sweet, gentlemen.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.251
We're gonna be the eyes and ears
for some people inside the Beltway.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.960
Yeah, a bunch of suits
sipping chai lattes.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.168
Maybe, but Fisk vouched for this one.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.289
- No shit.
- Living the dream.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.206
If it doesn't suck, we don't do it.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.322
Hey, Martinelli,
tags and personal effects.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.000
You telling me this is unofficial?

19:25.800 --> 19:29.202
We get caught on the wrong
side of the fence, we never existed.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.405
You're new, so a little advice.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.481
Don't be that guy.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.562
<i>What gm!”-?</i>

19:45.240 --> 19:46.685
You got a beautiful sister, Martinelli.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.682
She spoken for?

19:49.240 --> 19:50.366
She's not my sister, sir.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.691
It doesn't matter where Seaman's from.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.128
- Report on contacts.
- No immediate contacts.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.442
Park.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.250
Forty miles from the Russian coast, sir.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.206
We should be right on top of her.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.610
We might not be the first ones here.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.042
Captain?

20:22.560 --> 20:23.925
XO, deploy the sea scan.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.725
Deploy sea scan. Aye, Captain.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.202
Deploy the sea scan.
Set scope at 1,000 knots.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.847
Sir, I'm picking up something.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.762
Could be a debris field.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.763
Could be vents on the sea floor.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.041
Or a deep water reef.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.484
It wouldn't affect the magnetic field.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.241
There she is.

21:17.720 --> 21:18.562
Jesus.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.691
Jimenez, maneuver the sea scan
towards the bow.

21:47.880 --> 21:48.961
She was torpedoed.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.881
- Cob, man battle stations.
- Man battle stations, aye.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.447
Flood tubes one and two.
Open outer doors on tube two.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.487
Man battle stations.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.686
<i>Man battle stations.</i>

21:58.320 --> 22:00.004
- Okay, open the breach door.
- Forward clear!

22:02.040 --> 22:03.804
Engine room, engine room,
somebody get these...

22:05.360 --> 22:06.361
Come on, come on, let's go!

22:08.960 --> 22:10.450
Flood tubes one, two, three, four.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.407
Flood tubes, aye.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.041
Secure torpedo rigs.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.282
Open outer doors! Go! Go! Go!

22:16.920 --> 22:18.524
Draft a message for next comms window.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.887
"USS Tampa Bay sunk by enemy action."

22:21.120 --> 22:22.087
Yes, sir.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.930
Tubes one and two ready for launch.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.771
Engine room, cap and rig
for maximum reliability.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.562
Captain? You should hear this.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.605
Tell me that's coming from Tampa Bay.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.561
Get me a bearing.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.090
Bearing 2-2-1, clear as a bell.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.771
Steer course 2-2-1.

22:51.040 --> 22:51.927
Steering course 2-2-1.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.401
Mr. Edwards, get that robot
back on board ASAP.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.001
Recall the sea scan.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.321
What the hell is that?

23:14.800 --> 23:15.722
New contact, Captain.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.325
Detecting auxiliary noises overhead.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.530
Somebody's ice-picked up there.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.761
They're right on top of us.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.723
Distance 8-5-0.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.250
The American sub is increasing speed.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.445
Fire torpedoes one and two.

23:49.080 --> 23:53.210
Bearing 0-4-5, O-4-6...

23:56.400 --> 23:57.640
Torpedoes in the water!

23:57.720 --> 23:58.562
They fired at us?

23:59.840 --> 24:02.127
Inbound, best bearing 1-9-0 and closing.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.281
Pilot, take her to manual.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.691
Left full rudder, all ahead flank.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.330
Launch evasion devices.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.209
Captain, torpedoes are chasing
countermeasure.

24:18.600 --> 24:19.522
Give them new coordinates.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.731
Snapshot, prepare to fire tube one
on the bearing of enemy contact.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.609
- Ship ready!
- Solution ready!

24:26.840 --> 24:27.682
Weapon ready!

24:27.960 --> 24:30.088
Match sonar bearings and fire!

24:31.720 --> 24:33.609
Normal launch! Torpedo course 2-1-9!

24:41.800 --> 24:44.087
Captain, torpedo bearing 3-0-0.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.930
- It passed under us.
- It won't find us in the ice.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.128
There's a lot of interference
on the surface, Captain.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.281
Hard to find her in the noise.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.523
Pull up towed array
past appropriate gauge.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.884
Weps, turn weapon 180 degrees.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.930
Reduce search depth to 40 feet.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.365
Reduce depth to 40 feet. Aye, Captain.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.644
Equalize the air vents seven to ten!

25:13.720 --> 25:15.449
- There she is.
- Holy shit.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.760
Eyes on enemy contact.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.646
Captain, it's a hit!

25:28.720 --> 25:30.210
Get those headphones back on, Belford.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.211
Pilot, zero bubble, maintain flank speed.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.688
Captain, enemy torpedoes
still active and closing!

25:40.160 --> 25:41.730
Nav, report the bearing to Tampa Bay.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.961
We're going to run straight at her.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.042
<i>Tampa Bay, sin'?</i>

25:44.120 --> 25:46.088
If I have to say everything twice,
we're not going to make it.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.208
- Report the bearing!
- Yes, sir. 0-1-0.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.727
Pilot, steady course 0-1-0,
40 degree down bubble.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.086
0-1-0, 40 down. Aye, Captain.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.323
Now, when I tell you,
pull up with everything.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.401
Sounding 300 feet.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.321
Two-five-zero!

26:12.520 --> 26:14.090
- 200 feet.
- Red sounding.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.087
- Red sounding.
- One-five-zero!

26:18.440 --> 26:19.407
One hundred feet!

26:22.920 --> 26:26.288
- Repeat red sounding!
- Seventy-five! Fifty feet!

26:26.800 --> 26:27.801
- Forty feet!
- Captain!

26:28.040 --> 26:30.850
Thirty feet! Two-five.
Twenty feet!

26:30.920 --> 26:31.887
Pull up. Zero bubble.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.166
Torpedo's 200 feet!

26:47.640 --> 26:50.484
- Skipper, suggest we...
- Hold her. Stay on the floor.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.449
- Terminal homing, Captain!
- Right full rudder!

26:58.520 --> 26:59.851
Right full rudder. Aye, Captain.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.723
- Everybody all right?
- Aye.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.762
I'm okay.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.007
Did we just start a war?

27:51.560 --> 27:53.881
No, but we might have sailed into one.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.282
Captain?

28:01.600 --> 28:02.761
Somebody's still down there, sir.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.330
President, Minister Durov.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.244
They sunk our submarine <i>Volkov.</i>

28:38.640 --> 28:40.005
What the hell are the Americans doing?

28:40.720 --> 28:43.530
We must respond immediately
to protect the sovereignty of Russia.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.931
Sir, I recommend we launch Yevchenko
to sweep for American submarines.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.290
I want to speak
with the American president.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.891
Sir, message from USS Arkansas.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.009
I got a Rear Admiral without enough sense
to get out of the rain.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.203
Sir, we've got a shootout under the ice.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.482
Two Russian, one American.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.090
What's the response from Moscow?

29:26.320 --> 29:29.290
Nothing. Nothing to the Pentagon
or the State Department, sir.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.203
And we know they've been
conducting exercises

29:31.280 --> 29:33.521
with the Northern Fleet
over the last few weeks.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.410
Exercises, my ass.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.127
President Zakarin is already in Polyarny.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.811
Move the closest carrier battle group
into position.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.125
Yes, sir. And you should know,

29:47.200 --> 29:50.761
we have special operators en route
to determine Zakarin's intentions.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.323
Admiral Fisk,
I don't think I need to explain

29:53.400 --> 29:55.289
to a war hero such as yourself,

29:55.360 --> 29:57.089
but when someone is shooting at you,

29:57.760 --> 29:59.046
you know their intentions.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.526
Let's gear up, fellas!

30:12.000 --> 30:13.570
Shit, is that lightning?

30:13.960 --> 30:16.611
Hey, Martinelli, quit the chatter!

30:19.440 --> 30:20.487
Go, go, go!

31:06.040 --> 31:07.087
Martinelli!

31:28.040 --> 31:29.804
Slow down. Slow down, little brother.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.248
What's your name?
Come on, what's your name?

31:36.360 --> 31:37.247
Thursday.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.681
Fuck.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.766
It's another <i>Akula,</i> Captain.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.361
Damage to the bow.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.410
Probably on impact with the sea floor.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.291
Tampa Bay took her down with her.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.204
<i>Tampa</i> Bay didn't fire on anyone.

32:24.040 --> 32:24.927
Captain?

32:26.040 --> 32:27.610
Her torpedo doors were closed.

32:29.560 --> 32:30.402
Jesus.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.771
How does anyone live through that?

32:36.280 --> 32:38.442
Ever seen a blast signature like this, XO?

32:39.960 --> 32:42.531
Until today, I hadn't seen
any torpedoed submarines.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.006
You're not seeing one here.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.726
Look at the skin of the hull.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.364
The shrapnel patterns are pointing out.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.448
You used to light cherry bombs
as a kid, right?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.684
You and I had very different childhoods.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.886
We used to set them off in car tailpipes.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.046
Make slivers like those.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.042
That explosion came from inside the sub.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.406
Her torpedoes cooked off?

33:08.840 --> 33:11.161
They're not that far aft.
Not even on an Akula.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.604
Nav, report bottom depth.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.241
Can we get them out?

33:34.280 --> 33:36.203
762 feet, Captain.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.801
That's touch and go, sir.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.451
They took out Tampa Bay.
They don't deserve a rescue.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.485
They were following somebody's orders,
Reed.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.451
Captain, we just torpedoed
a sub in their water.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.921
The Russians will respond with
a search party on high alert.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.126
That would be logical, yeah.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.970
But if they were behaving logically,

33:55.160 --> 33:56.525
they would've tried their own rescue,

33:57.280 --> 33:58.281
not fired on us.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.683
Look, nobody's following the playbook.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.205
We don't know what's going on up top.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.681
The only people who might have a clue
are down there on that ocean floor.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.364
Yeah, Russians, sir,

34:12.159 --> 34:13.969
who, for all we know, just sunk Tampa Bay!

34:14.040 --> 34:15.041
Exactly my point.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.009
We don't know, XO, but they might.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.250
And for some reason,
their comrades have left them for dead.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.288
This is in direct violation
of our mission objective.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.202
Noted.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.762
<i>Cob, launch the Mystic.</i>

34:25.840 --> 34:27.284
Launch the <i>Mystic.</i> Aye, Captain.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.929
Put her down on the forward escape trunk.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.603
I want those Russian sailors outta there.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.842
Sir, at the very least,
we need to contact 6th Fleet.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.161
And they'll be dead
by the time we get an answer!

34:39.120 --> 34:40.485
Have commo draft a message,

34:41.520 --> 34:42.806
but I'm not waiting for a reply.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.042
Aye, Captain.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.560
<i>Arkansas, Mystic.</i>

34:52.400 --> 34:54.368
Flooding and equalizing skirt
for undocking.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.849
Mating latch, released.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.242
Couple of feet deeper,
and we get crushed like a beer can.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.526
The currents are strong, cabrén.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.844
- Four knots, 1-5-0.
- Copy that.

35:43.720 --> 35:44.881
Speed, 0.2.

35:52.800 --> 35:53.881
Five feet.

35:56.000 --> 35:56.842
God damn it.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.560
- Two feet.
- We're stuck in a riptide!

36:12.920 --> 36:13.921
And locked.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.122
I'm Commander Glass of USS Arkansas.

37:47.920 --> 37:52.289
XO, have these men treated
for hypothermia by the Doc.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.486
But keep them placed under guard.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.364
Until we hear something from above,
these men are prisoners of war.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.162
Cob.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.331
Separate the Captain from his men.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.805
I want him kept in isolation.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.727
Aye, Captain.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.242
Nellie is away.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.444
<i>Hey, boss, what's your sitrep?</i>

40:19.600 --> 40:21.329
Got some heavy ordnance down there.

40:21.640 --> 40:22.846
They're loading destroyers.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.489
Pulling up to a tin can right now.

40:31.880 --> 40:32.722
Well, make it look good.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.490
These pictures are going live
to Washington.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.450
Oh, yeah, we're famous.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.606
Why aren't we getting a clear picture?

40:42.680 --> 40:44.603
Something's giving us interference.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.523
We're having trouble making a connection,
ma'am.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.850
- Uh, can I, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.651
They're using a signal jammer.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.888
Sir. Sir.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.650
All cellular channels are blocked.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.728
I cannot reach Washington or Moscow.

41:07.680 --> 41:08.681
What's going on?

41:14.320 --> 41:18.006
Tell them to try frequency 2282.5 MHz.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.441
- Ma'am?
- 2282.5 MHz.

41:22.120 --> 41:24.691
The NSA has a few satellite frequencies
that we don't normally share.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.691
But we're all on the same team here,
right?

41:27.400 --> 41:28.242
Yeah.

41:28.600 --> 41:29.442
Okay-

41:35.280 --> 41:36.486
Got it!

41:44.000 --> 41:45.001
Those guys are good.

42:05.800 --> 42:08.007
Who is that? Can you zoom in, please?

42:12.560 --> 42:14.050
- We're losing them.
- On the drone.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.722
That's Durov.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.529
Russian Minister of Defense.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.685
I see the presidential helicopter.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.761
I don't see Zakarin.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.562
He's up here.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.286
Can we get a closer look?

42:37.640 --> 42:38.641
What are you up to?

42:57.640 --> 42:59.051
Why are they launching the destroyer?

43:04.040 --> 43:05.121
This is an outrage, Minister.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.003
I'm cut off from all my command structures
in Moscow.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.484
I need a secure emergency line
opened immediately!

43:13.440 --> 43:15.363
Sir, we may be under threat

43:15.440 --> 43:16.851
from an imminent attack.

43:17.560 --> 43:18.891
I've sealed off the base

43:19.320 --> 43:21.448
and shut down all communications

43:21.520 --> 43:22.521
as a security precaution.

43:25.680 --> 43:26.920
That is not your decision to make.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.441
I must inform my ministers, my Parliament,

43:33.720 --> 43:34.721
and my Generals.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.046
I've spoken to them,

43:38.200 --> 43:39.440
and I told them

43:40.360 --> 43:43.967
that you are indisposed and in my care.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.561
That's enough of this.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.290
- Dmitri?
- From now on,

44:15.880 --> 44:17.644
all military orders will come from me.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.529
The military won't follow your orders.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.567
They have no choice.

44:20.840 --> 44:22.171
As far as they're concerned,

44:22.680 --> 44:25.650
every order I give
will have come from you.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.604
I'm your Minister of Defense,

44:29.880 --> 44:33.362
and I intend to defend
our interests and our country

44:33.600 --> 44:35.682
from any threat, inside or out.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.003
Even those from a weak leader.

44:39.800 --> 44:40.642
Really?

44:50.360 --> 44:52.089
- You'll be executed for this.
- No, Nicolai.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.168
By the time anyone knows what's happened,

44:57.640 --> 44:59.165
the nation will be at war.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.929
And concerned only with victory.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.569
Everything else will be forgotten.

45:22.240 --> 45:23.685
Hey, buddy, you seeing this?

45:25.680 --> 45:26.522
Gimme some audio.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.362
Admiral.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.564
Are we getting sound?
Can you turn that up?

45:51.840 --> 45:52.682
Oh, my God.

45:58.800 --> 45:59.642
Shit.

46:04.640 --> 46:05.687
It's a coup.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.531
I need to brief the president.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.601
He's gonna recommend moving the fleet
into position, isn't he?

46:15.680 --> 46:17.284
He's going to play the hand
he's been dealt.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.361
You know what that means.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.930
How well do you know
the men on the ground?

46:37.680 --> 46:39.808
What about reaching out to
the Russian military directly?

46:40.120 --> 46:41.849
Whatever happened down there,
Madam President,

46:41.920 --> 46:43.570
Durov has made us look like the aggressor.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.563
To his own people
and the rest of the world.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.041
- Can we prove this is a coup?
- The facts are simple.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.607
Durov is moving his fleet
to a war footing.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.842
We let them gain a tactical advantage now,

46:52.920 --> 46:55.287
no one's ever going to remember
who threw the first punch.

46:55.360 --> 46:58.045
I recommend that we deploy
the carrier group

46:58.120 --> 47:00.122
and raise our status to DEFCON 2.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.687
Excuse me, Admiral. I'm sorry.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.929
We may be playing right
into Durov's hands.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.809
I think he wants our fleets to engage.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.844
What are you saying,
he wants an all-out war?

47:12.200 --> 47:14.851
I'm saying that I think
it's all choreographed.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.210
The Russian constitution stipulates

47:17.280 --> 47:18.725
that if a president is indisposed

47:18.800 --> 47:20.245
during a time of active hostilities,

47:20.560 --> 47:22.210
all authority falls
to the Russian Minister.

47:22.520 --> 47:25.126
Anybody start World War Ill
just to grab power...

47:25.200 --> 47:26.042
That's my point.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.011
It's not a standoff with Russia.

47:28.080 --> 47:30.208
We're dealing with
a single rogue minister.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.890
So this may be a coup without
any deep support within the military.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.088
Can we go after Durov? Bunker-buster?

47:36.160 --> 47:37.400
That might kill Zakarin.

47:37.920 --> 47:40.571
Which I think is why Durov
is keeping him alive.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.610
Miss Norquist, this sounds like
excellent analysis for a history book,

47:43.680 --> 47:45.648
but we won't be the ones
writing that book,

47:45.720 --> 47:47.404
unless we respond now!

47:47.840 --> 47:51.401
They attacked us and killed 110 Americans!

47:51.480 --> 47:53.847
They don't want an all-out war
any more than we do.

47:53.920 --> 47:56.844
Madam President, when somebody makes
a move on a chessboard,

47:56.920 --> 47:58.126
you respond!

48:03.200 --> 48:04.281
Maybe we don't have a choice.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.643
What if we could free President Zakarin?

48:12.000 --> 48:12.967
Madam President, we don't have...

48:13.040 --> 48:13.962
No. Let him speak.

48:14.880 --> 48:15.722
Thank you, Madam.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.202
We have a team outside the base
at Polyarny.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.849
And a submarine off the coast.

48:22.080 --> 48:24.560
The pieces are in place
for a rescue and exfil.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.005
I know the men involved.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.242
If we can deliver Zakarin to Moscow,

48:28.560 --> 48:29.800
he could cut this off.

48:30.280 --> 48:32.487
We rescue the Russian president?

48:32.560 --> 48:34.847
We may not like Zakarin,
but he's better than Durov.

48:35.560 --> 48:36.721
We'd be at war.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.490
Admiral, take us to DEFCON 2.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.561
Move the carrier fleet into position.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.246
We need to be prepared to confront Durov.

48:54.440 --> 48:58.809
But I wanna do everything possible
to avoid this.

49:00.720 --> 49:03.041
Your rescue attempt has my authorization
as well.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.807
Men, we've been ordered to Polyarny base.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.806
The Murmansk Fjord?
How far in are we going?

49:34.440 --> 49:35.441
Right up to her doorstep.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.648
It's heavily defended by destroyers.

49:39.760 --> 49:41.091
Half the Russian fleet's there.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.685
Top priority orders, XO.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.044
Admiral Durov is staging a coup.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.563
We're going in to get four of our boys.

49:49.840 --> 49:50.887
And one Russian president.

49:55.880 --> 49:57.803
Nav, get me the latest charts and intel

49:57.880 --> 49:58.802
on those mine fields.

49:59.040 --> 50:00.280
Aye, Captain.

50:00.360 --> 50:03.091
Weps, have the torpedo
and fire control systems double-checked.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.764
Torpedo and fire control systems
double-checked.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.446
- Make your depth 400 feet, pilot.
- Making depth 400 feet. Aye, Captain.

50:13.560 --> 50:15.005
Sir, that fjord is mined,

50:15.080 --> 50:17.128
it's covered in sensors and sonar fields.

50:18.840 --> 50:20.205
No matter how many precautions we take,

50:20.280 --> 50:22.169
it won't be enough
to get us through undetected.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.521
You're right, XO.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.570
That's why we need a local navigator.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.640
Does he know where he is?

50:43.720 --> 50:45.961
He does. He just can't believe it.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.122
Okay, leave us.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.205
I'm sorry about your men.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.531
We've crossed paths before, you and I.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.606
<i>I was on the Baton Rouge</i>

51:10.680 --> 51:12.250
when we brushed past you off Greenland.

51:15.880 --> 51:18.008
I've read your file, Captain.
I know you speak English.

51:18.760 --> 51:19.568
Fuck you.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.125
Okay. Very good, now we're talking.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.367
I have nothing to say.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.442
We did not fire on your submarine,
Captain.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.202
No one did.

51:32.760 --> 51:33.761
You don't believe me?

51:35.440 --> 51:36.601
Here, look at this.

51:47.720 --> 51:49.085
You blew up from the inside out.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.166
You were sabotaged.

52:07.440 --> 52:08.441
Why do you show this to me?

52:13.320 --> 52:15.561
I do not cooperate with enemy.
I am no traitor.

52:15.640 --> 52:16.687
No.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.846
I'm not saying you are a traitor.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.287
The traitor is the man
who blew up your sub.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.561
The traitor's the man responsible for
the deaths of all those young sailors:

52:26.640 --> 52:27.527
Admiral Durov.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.960
Durov is holding your president hostage
at Polyarny,

52:33.480 --> 52:36.165
and we've been ordered to sail through
the Murmansk Fjord to rescue him.

52:38.640 --> 52:40.369
I can't do that without your help.

52:41.240 --> 52:42.730
I trained the men at Polyarny.

52:44.680 --> 52:46.011
I will not help you to kill them.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.684
We're not trying to kill your men.

52:49.880 --> 52:51.644
We're only trying to rescue
your president...

52:51.720 --> 52:53.609
...and maybe put a stop to this.

52:57.480 --> 52:58.845
You know, we're no different, you and I.

53:02.480 --> 53:05.370
We've been down here our whole careers.

53:06.880 --> 53:07.881
Toe-to-toe.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.765
We're not enemies, we're brothers.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.401
Who else understands
what it is we go through?

53:18.680 --> 53:20.523
The isolation, the fear.

53:21.280 --> 53:24.887
Riding for months inside a bomb
scraping at the bottom of the ocean.

53:27.800 --> 53:30.201
But it's what we are. It's what we do.

53:31.200 --> 53:34.966
So you know what it took for me
to get you out of that sub?

53:35.840 --> 53:38.684
I risked my men. I risked my ship.

53:40.360 --> 53:41.361
I risked a court-martial.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.211
Because it was the right thing to do.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.049
It's not about your side or my side.

54:00.680 --> 54:01.920
This is about our future.

54:19.480 --> 54:22.324
Sir, we picked up
an unauthorized transmission.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.449
2282.5 MHZ.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.041
It's going out from near the base.

54:28.800 --> 54:29.642
Find it.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.085
So, what's the situation, boss?

54:54.160 --> 54:55.650
I just got orders
from Washington.

54:55.720 --> 54:56.846
Incoming. Ten o'clock.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.002
Shit.

55:01.960 --> 55:02.802
We gotta go.

55:22.400 --> 55:23.401
What is this?

57:18.360 --> 57:19.521
Oh.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.611
We got you. We got you, come on.

57:25.240 --> 57:29.086
It missed the bone, but I don't think
he's gonna run a marathon anytime soon.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.884
Okay, listen up.

57:31.960 --> 57:33.724
I've got some good news and bad news.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.166
On the plus side,
we don't have to hike to Norway.

57:37.720 --> 57:39.085
United States Navy is sending us

57:39.160 --> 57:41.561
our very own nuclear submarine
to give us a ride out.

57:41.640 --> 57:44.041
- A U.S. sub? Up here?
- Yeah.

57:44.120 --> 57:44.962
There's a catch.

57:46.400 --> 57:49.006
We gotta grab the Russian president
and take him with us.

57:50.600 --> 57:51.761
Shit.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.087
Zakafln?

57:54.920 --> 57:55.967
Thought we hated that guy.

57:56.280 --> 57:57.884
Yeah, well, I guess things changed.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.171
Look, I know it's a big ask, but...

58:03.440 --> 58:05.647
I get the feeling that
if we don't pull this off,

58:07.000 --> 58:08.240
things could get ugly.

58:09.080 --> 58:11.287
- Like real ugly.
- Yeah, fuck it.

58:12.080 --> 58:13.923
I'd rather go kick some ass
than sit up here

58:14.000 --> 58:15.365
freezing my nuts off, anyway.

58:19.120 --> 58:19.962
What about Marty?

58:23.760 --> 58:24.921
I got other plans for you.

58:29.120 --> 58:31.043
Captain, we're holding outside the fjord.

58:31.800 --> 58:32.801
Awaiting your orders.

58:33.840 --> 58:34.682
Very well.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.410
Execute final preps, XO.

58:38.880 --> 58:39.881
Aye, sir.

58:46.480 --> 58:47.402
How's the crew?

58:48.720 --> 58:49.721
They wouldn't say it, sir,

58:50.720 --> 58:52.210
but I've been with these men a long time.

58:53.360 --> 58:54.327
They're terrified.

58:54.800 --> 58:55.608
Mmm.

58:56.320 --> 58:57.367
And what about you?

58:59.680 --> 59:01.011
Twenty-two years I've been at this.

59:02.440 --> 59:03.441
I've never been shot at.

59:04.960 --> 59:05.961
I can't say I liked it.

59:09.440 --> 59:11.522
Me neither. Just between us.

59:13.880 --> 59:14.881
All due respect, sir.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.727
You just keep leading.

59:17.760 --> 59:19.091
Let us do the worrying.

59:22.640 --> 59:25.803
Okay. Let's go get the crew ready.

59:30.080 --> 59:31.286
Captain in control.

59:42.440 --> 59:44.124
Warship Arkansas, this is your captain.

59:45.120 --> 59:46.770
<i>We're going into the Murmansk Fjord.</i>

59:47.160 --> 59:48.400
<i>Go over the boat's power plant</i>

59:49.240 --> 59:50.765
<i>and the ship's noise signature.</i>

59:51.680 --> 59:54.081
<i>I want this baby so quiet,
fish 'II bump into her.</i>

59:57.320 --> 59:59.561
- Ooh-rah, Arkansas.
- Ooh-rah!

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.604
XO, take her in nice and slow.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.720
Pilot, steady course 1-7-0.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.362
All ahead two-thirds.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.210
Course 1-7-0...

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.127
Sonar, ears open for sound sensors.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.491
Yes, sir. All ahead two-thirds.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.846
Steer course 1-4-6.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.601
1-4-6.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.441
1-4-4.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.521
- Captain.
- Mark your depth.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.763
- All stop.
- Halt all engines.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.447
All engines off.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.202
Men, this is Captain Andropov

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.931
<i>of the RFS Konek.</i>

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.842
He's our guest.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.764
XO, set him up.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.200
What's the matter?

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.364
You never seen a Russian captain before?

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.966
Eyes on your stations.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.202
Sir.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.084
These systems are classified.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.922
I know.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.641
You speak Russian, Park?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.447
Ask him if he knows the captain
that shot down Tampa Bay.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.290
He trained him to do his job,
Reed. Now, you do yours.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.249
This is the most reckless thing
I've ever seen.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.206
Captain, recommend
we confine the Russian captain

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.202
until we return to Faslane...

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.930
Let me clue you all in on something.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.045
Now, we've been ordered to cross waters

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.407
that no American sub
has ever crossed before.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.721
When you look at him,

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.809
you shouldn't see anything other than
a sailor in his own backyard.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.280
Now, we saved his life.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.042
I figure the odds are at least even
that he's going to save ours, too.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.643
- Captain...
- This is absurd!

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.567
The arrogance of this,
for you to bring him in here!

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.681
You will be court-martialed!

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.249
Then it's my job to keep you alive
long enough so you can testify.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:36.882
Captain.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.041
Pilot, all ahead one-third.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.370
Steer course 1-6-0.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.649
Aye, sir. All ahead one-third.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.604
There's a cliff just off
the port bow, Captain,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.330
bearing 1-1-0 at 400 yards.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.926
Nav, stay as close as you can
to the rocks without scraping the paint.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.362
Aye, Captain.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.967
- Pilot, steer course 1-5-2.
- Steer course 1-5-2.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.964
XO, take us along the ocean floor.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.691
Set your altitude to 20 feet.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:10.761
Yes, Captain.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.406
Pilot, 15 degrees down bubble.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.042
Here.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.250
- Sound sensors.
- Silence, men. Not a breath.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.642
All stations calm.
Set condition ultra-quiet.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.725
Acoustic-detonating mines.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.805
How are we supposed to get past those?

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.321
There's another way.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.562
Here.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.281
He's leading us into a dead end, Captain.
Look at the chart.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.601
Your chart is wrong.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.241
There's passage.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.201
Where is this passage?

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.361
<i>Sleva, left.</i>

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.567
0-7-0.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.407
Now.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.529
- Left full rudder, 0-7-0.
- 0-7-0.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.131
There's no sign of passage, Captain.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.406
There's no way through.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.685
We're going to run straight into a wall.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.569
Captain, we have to reverse engines.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.961
XO, if you can't take it,
confine yourself.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:15.962
Hang on.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.406
There it is. There's an opening.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640
Through the choke point.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.241
Open seas ahead.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.841
XO, what's better...

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.321
To be right or to be alive?

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.203
Aye, sir. Ready for orders.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600
XO has the Conn.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:48.881
Okay, boys.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:53.285
We go in, snatch the Russian president,
take a quick refreshing swim,

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:56.569
and then rendezvous with a U.S. sub.
Nothing to it.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.762
- Sounds like a walk in the park, boss.
- Yeah.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.170
What are we gonna do about Martinelli?

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.089
When we're done, if I'm still alive,

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:06.962
I'll come back for him.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.689
We're dropping into a goddamn coup,
aren't we?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.881
Don't ask me.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.445
I don't know shit about politics.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.402
Let's go swimming.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.088
Whoa.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.568
Take it easy, buddy. Take her easy.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.524
- Who are you?
- Search and Rescue.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.606
Off the grid. Three ghosts.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.407
- Why are you here?
- You know more than we do.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.008
We got a ride out of trouble
for your president,

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.081
if we can get to him.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.281
In a few hours' time,

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.084
both our navies are
going to go head-to-head,

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.241
and it's gonna get ugly.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.524
We're just two assholes out in the cold.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.731
This is all riding on us.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.880
I can get you to him.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.121
Fix him up.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.607
Minister, the fleet awaits
your orders, sir.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.482
There.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.886
Fire in the hole.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.881
Get him up!

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.486
Gimme your hands, sir.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.449
Gimme your hands.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.002
Hold steady!

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.845
- He's an American.
- He's here to free us.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.605
Yeah, I don't like it either, sir.
Come on, let's go!

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.926
I've got these two up front.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.847
Man down!

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.521
Man down!

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.327
Cover me!

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.442
Clear!

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.562
Follow me!

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.801
- Come on, follow me!
- Come on!

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.282
Oleg!

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.489
- Come on!
- Go! Go!

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.650
- Wait there, sir.
- Hall!

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.610
On the ledge, sir. On the ledge.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.481
Go, sir! Go!

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.124
- Give me weapon, soldier.
- Shit.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.162
We gotta move.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.206
Fuck you.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.686
Jesus Christ, Johnstone!

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.362
Go! Go! Go!

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.887
Move!

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.528
Come on! No!

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.770
God damn it, Hall! Hall! Come on!

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.802
Billy, we lost him.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.323
God damn it.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.362
They're coming.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.681
We gotta swim. Come on!

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.607
The orders are for four Americans
and one Russian civilian.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.922
There aren't too many
training simulations for this one.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.766
- Roger that.
- All right. Go.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.050
All systems checked.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.722
Ready to disconnect.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.723
<i>Mystic, Conn. Ship is all yours.</i>

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.530
Move! Move! Come on, move!

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.643
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.245
Come on!

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.367
Go!

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.561
Come on, let's go!

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.321
Come on!

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.282
Dive!

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.042
Stay down!

01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:58.922
Stay down!

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.042
Stay down!

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.044
He's hit! He's hit!

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:32.362
Come on, let's go!

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.605
Go! Go!

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.490
Keep moving, sir! Come on!

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.927
Come on, let's go! Go!

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.406
Come on!

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.246
Keep moving, Mr. President.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.531
- Come on!
- Come on.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.487
Please, sir.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:36.762
Come on!

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.607
Where the hell is she?

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:47.962
There she is!

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.202
Okay, Mr. President...

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:52.842
Come on!

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.241
Down. Here we go.

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.767
Come on, Johnstone! Dive!

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.761
Take a deep breath, sir.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.125
Too long. They're taking too long.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.850
He's not fucking coming, bro.
He's not gonna come.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.402
Shit!

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.687
Grab him by the arms!

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.722
Come on, pull him!

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.806
Come on, get him out!

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.004
Hey. Hey, where are the others?

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.566
Seal the hatch! We gotta go, come on!

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.961
You seal it.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.528
<i>Minister Durov, the Americans escaped.</i>

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.090
<i>- And the president?
- Americans took him.</i>

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.920
<i>If he's alive, he's in their sub.</i>

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.526
Seal the fjord!

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.085
Sink the American submarine
before she escapes!

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.369
Captain, I'm picking up
a faint 300 MHz tonal.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.441
Heavy screw beat.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.642
Is it domestic?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.411
No, sir.
Sounds like an auxiliary.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.322
It's on the surface.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.481
That's a warship.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.969
That's Yevchenko, a destroyer.

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.369
I trained the men myself.
They will not miss.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.045
Pressure's building rapidly.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.963
The deeper we go, the more leaks we get.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.370
I got the beacon! Real weak.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.611
Set bearing 0-3-1
to intercept with Arkansas.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.451
Mama, this is baby.
Hold on to your signal.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.164
Depth 1-7-0. Coming around now.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.409
Captain, Harbor Control reports

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.006
- a contact at the magnetic sensors.
- That's her!

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.489
Launch rocket mortars
on the designated bearing!

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.042
It won't take much more.
We're almost home.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.403
Mystic, Conn. We have <i>visual</i> contact.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.845
Oh, that is a pretty sight.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.042
- Mystic, Conn.
- Shit!

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.526
<i>Mating hatch is ready for launch.</i>

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.642
Come on!

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.881
Baby, touchdown!

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.242
Engaging latch! Drain the hatch now!

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.168
Go! Hurry up! Move!
Get the hell out of here! Go!

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.404
Rocket mortar splashes close range!

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.845
Sound the collision alarm! Lock it down!

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.008
- All ahead flank!
- All ahead flank. Aye, Captain.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.483
Let's go! Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.131
Prep room for triage.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.531
Patient has gunshot wounds.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.886
Ten seconds since splashes!

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.161
<i>Captain, the Mystics not secure.</i>

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.083
- We're gonna rip her right off.
- Fire the explosive bolts!

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.640
- Jettison that thing now!
- Jettisoning the Mystic. Aye, Captain.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.563
Fifteen seconds
since mortar splashes!

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.441
Hatch secure!

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.245
Twenty seconds since mortar splash!

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.321
Rig for impact!

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.166
Rig ship for impact!

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.925
Pilot, steady the boat!

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.246
Left full rudder! Steady course 0-1-0.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.847
Left full rudder! Aye, Captain!
Heading 0-1-0!

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.201
We got a leak!

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.771
Park, you okay?

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.082
Come on, buddy, get up.
Get up. You're fine.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.165
Belford, where the hell's that destroyer?

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.082
I can't find her, sir.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.764
It'll be a minute for
the blast circle to die down.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.365
If we can't hear her, sir,
she can't hear us.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.329
All right, well, then let's see
if we can slip out of here.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.363
Pilot, all ahead one-third, minimum amps.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.282
Cob, damage report.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.521
Fire in the main switchboard.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.046
Flooding in the torpedo room.
We're taking on water.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.282
Captain? Picking up contact.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.607
Bearing 2-2-1. They're shallow.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.640
All ahead flank!
I want that sub on the floor!

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.601
Here they come.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.809
Get ready to dive fast and hard.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.083
They're firing! Torpedoes in the water!

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.284
Launch evasion devices! Dive!
60 degree down bubble!

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.646
60 degree down bubble. Aye, sir.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.688
Bottom depth 7-9-5!

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.609
Bottom depth 7-9-5! Thank you, Captain.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.011
Contact on destroyer!

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.410
Yevchenko bearing 0-2-1!
They're closing fast.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.925
Firing port procedures.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.368
Prepare to fire tube one on bearing 0-2-1.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.481
Prepare to fire. Aye, Captain.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:02.721
Bearing 0-2-1.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.525
- Ship ready!
- Solution ready!

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:05.762
Weapon ready!

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.482
Hold your fire.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.561
Holding fire, aye.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.890
There's still one coming,
bearing 3-5-5 and closing!

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.606
- We're gonna hit the bottom!
- Port main engine overheating!

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.887
- Sir, do we fire back?
- I said hold your fire.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.241
Depth to sea floor?

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.129
Depth 1-5-0 feet under the keel.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:32.362
- Pull back to zero bubble!
- Forward trim.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.688
Captain? Ls the bottom soft?

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.445
Yes, Captain. Mud.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.564
Okay, bring me down to it,
and do it quickly.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.242
We're gonna lie on the bottom
like a catfish.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.011
One hundred feet!

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.442
Seventy-five!

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.484
Five-zero feet! All back emergency!

01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.641
Brace for impact!

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.802
Twenty-five feet! Fifteen feet!

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.004
- Five feet!
- Impact!

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.205
Oh, Christ. Get that up.

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.202
IUSS has detected explosions
just outside Polyarny.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:25.641
Is she down?

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.169
- Is she sunk?
- Can't confirm, sir.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.480
God damn it!

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.683
Bring the fleet to battle readiness.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.360
We're going to DEFCON 1.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.410
Fisk, the president's going
to be calling our NATO allies,

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.201
and she will have to explain
how Zakarin died in our hands!

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.161
Do you understand what you did?

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.962
If Durov didn't have
all of Russia behind him before,

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.646
he sure as shit will now,
and everybody else on earth!

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.926
As far as they know,

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.971
we kidnapped the Russian president
and we killed him!

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.727
You didn't just start a war today...

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.241
You lost it, too.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.843
Minister, our ships will have visual
on the Americans momentarily.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.925
Good. Tell them to engage.

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:57.922
Yes, sir.

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.401
What the hell is that?

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.888
The rest of the Russian fleet
are moving into position.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.810
They're responding to our movements.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.765
We're leading them into the fight.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:05.885
We have captured the American.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.446
Waiting for our orders.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:09.961
<i>Execute him.</i>

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.442
You came back.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.246
Yeah, I needed the exercise.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.646
Hey! Hey!

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.682
You did good, kid. You did real good.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.008
What do you say we get the hell
out of here? Come on!

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.090
Fuck.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.165
Destroyer's bearing off, Captain.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.641
All right, everybody check your gear
for proper function.

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:18.924
- Aye, Captain.
- Sonar's still active.

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.809
XO, you have the Conn.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.007
I have the Conn. Aye, Captain.

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.162
Mr. President.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.648
Captain Andropov says
you are a man I can trust.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.206
I must speak with my generals.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.247
Once they find out the truth,
they'll stop Durov.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.001
I understand, sir.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.208
But once we rise to communication depth,

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.085
you won't be alive to tell that story.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.964
- Damage report.
- Fires contained.

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.328
Flooding is slow,
but we're still taking on water.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.927
Weps, what's the situation
in the torpedo room?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.968
- It's bad, Captain.
- Then get down there.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:27.882
Aye, sir.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.562
Shit! McCaw, give me a status report!

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.130
Weapons damage to tube one.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.611
We're leaking, but we're working on it!

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.485
God damn it!

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.447
All right, you go.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.401
Cob, torpedo room.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.724
It's two feet above
the deck plates, Captain.

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.242
<i>Damage to tube one.</i>

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.085
- Make tube two ready.
- Aye, sir!

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.525
Load torpedo four in tube two. Go!

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.728
All right, come on, guys.
Let's get this done, all right?

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.041
Shit!

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.930
- Man under! Man under!
- Man under!

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.365
- Come on!
- Move it! Come on!

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.162
Captain.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.249
The destroyer's0yer's circled back and closing,
Captain.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.682
What range?

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.770
She's closing fast.
Five hundred yards out.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.766
- Kaplan!
- You all right?

01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:58.802
Captain.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.201
Conn, torpedo room! Tube two damaged!

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.126
- Is any tube operational?
- Negative, Captain!

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.531
<i>All tubes out of commission.</i>

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.528
Captain.

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.241
They've locked on.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.042
We're sitting ducks.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.442
You say you trained the men
on that destroyer, Captain?

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.407
Yes.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.162
Every one.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:41.882
So, you know them well?

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.721
Very well.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.601
Would they be loyal to you?

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.122
Of course.

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.682
Show me.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.167
Fyodor Dubasov.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.202
<i>Mikhail Bakerin.</i>

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.761
<i>Ivan Dashkov.</i>

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.128
<i>Semyon Duchkin.</i>

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.208
<i>Aleksey Mostokov.</i>

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.164
<i>Mikhail Kazak.</i>

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.289
<i>Ivan Sakov.</i>

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.768
<i>Fyodor Tsvetkov.</i>

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.564
<i>Viktor Bezhegov.</i>

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.921
<i>Grigoriy Bakinskiy.</i>

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.363
<i>This is Captain Andropov.</i>

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.243
<i>I'm on board this American submarine,
USS Arkansas,</i>

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.729
<i>of my own free will.</i>

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.010
Hold your fire.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.611
The Arkansas, sir, she's alive.

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.409
They've surfaced right next to Yevchenko.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.405
What the hell is that captain doing?

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.128
Launch missile one on the submarine.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.483
Launch missile one on the submarine!

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:42.642
Fire now!

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.290
He's no longer your commander.

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:53.602
Now, fire.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:03.927
Arkansas is broadcasting directly
to the Yevchenko.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.845
<i>This is your president.</i>

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.851
<i>And I'm speaking to you
with complete authority.</i>

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:15.124
<i>Any act of aggression
against the American ship</i>

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.121
<i>will be an act of treason.</i>

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.969
- He's alive.
- That's why he surfaced.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.929
Jayne, get this to
the other Russian generals.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.525
I need an audio file on this now.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.887
Minister Durov, my crew will not fire
on the American submarine.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.849
Very well, Captain. I will do it myself.

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:39.888
Prepare KH35 surface-to-sea missiles.

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:40.922
Yes, sir.

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:55.370
We have a satellite detection
of KH35 launch vehicles on the move.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:56.761
Are they targeting our fleet?

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.964
They're targeting Arkansas, sir.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.849
Tell Glass the Russians drew first.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.288
He is authorized to fire.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.849
Sir, if he fires into Russian territory,
it'll set off every sensor in Russia.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.684
You'll be triggering a nuclear response.

01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.842
If that sub goes down
with the president on board,

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.922
we are in exactly the same place.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.606
Captain. Incoming message from Washington.

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.201
Patching to the Conn.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.367
Commander Glass.

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.330
Captain, this is Admiral Fisk.

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.485
You are authorized to protect Arkansas
and your crew.

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.804
Admiral, I need to know.
Are we already at war?

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.521
Russian missile systems
in position to launch, Captain.

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.482
Sir, if we take the first shot
above water,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.286
the whole world's gonna see us.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.806
Captain Glass, this is Charles Donnegan,

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.124
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.010
You have a madman on your hands.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.889
<i>I've authorized you to fire!</i>

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.563
We still have
the Tomahawk missiles, sir.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.681
Cob, battle stations.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.086
Man battle stations, aye.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.562
Launch procedures are underway, Minister.

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:19.961
Thirty seconds.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.925
Spin up missiles one and two.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.480
Transfer target package three-Charlie-24.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.206
Aye, Captain.
Transfer 24-A...

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.891
Flood Tomahawks one and two.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.240
Make solutions on warships now.

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:56.684
Captain, the American sub
has opened its missile tubes.

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.327
Tomahawks one and two ready for launch.

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.002
Captain.

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.883
You ever had to make a call
like this before, Captain?

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.247
No.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.685
Captain, Durov will fire on you.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.442
No, sir,

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.441
he'll be firing on you.

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.723
Missiles are fueled and ready, sir.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.368
Fire!

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.405
Missiles being fired from Polyarny.

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:11.801
What the hell's he doing?

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:14.330
Launch detection, 30 seconds.

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.280
Launch detection.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.283
Washington reports
15 seconds to impact, sir.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.691
Locked on enemy missiles, sir.

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.483
Captain, we're prepared to counter-launch.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.321
Remove safeties.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.246
All safeties off.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.006
- Five seconds, sir.
- We need to fire now, sir!

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:48.922
Captain!

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:50.642
Three seconds.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.963
- Intercept window closed!
- Impact!

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:32.881
What just happened?

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:19.324
Sir, we have a confirmed hit
on Russian soil.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.245
- Who fired?
- Not us.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.168
Polyarny Command Center
has been destroyed.

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.211
<i>Missiles from the Yevchenko.</i>

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.649
Hey, good job.

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.161
- Good work.
- Captain.

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.682
XO.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.971
That was close. Good work.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.202
Thank you.

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.281
How did you know?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:22.842
I didn't.

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.441
I hoped.

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.925
Russian fleet is bearing off.

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.004
They're backing up.
Jayne, what are you hearing?

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:38.489
The Russian fleet is taking orders
directly from Zakarin aboard Arkansas.

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.402
He's ordered the Air Force
to secure Polyarny.

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:21.086
Careful on that step.

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.690
Yeah, watch your feet,
Mr. President.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.411
Welcome aboard, sir.

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.087
Captain.

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:29.682
Captain.

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.161
I have to go to work.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.562
Me, too.

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:41.327
I can't think of any captain

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.730
that could have done what you have done,

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.325
on my side or yours.

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.122
I can.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.166
I'm looking at him.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:37.082
Get him up.

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.802
Be careful, he's injured.

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.362
How's your man?

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.684
He'll be okay. Couple of scratches.

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.282
- Joe Glass.
- Bill Beaman.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.371
So, you're the lunatic
saved the Russian president.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.771
And you're the crazy son of a bitch

01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:56.649
who weaved this tin can
through a mine field.

01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.290
- Got a long debriefing.
- Yeah.

01:50:59.040 --> 01:50:59.882
One hell of a story

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.962
we'll never be able
to tell our grandchildren.

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:08.087
I would like to take one last breath
before we go under.

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.129
You never know what it's gonna
be like when you come up.

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:14.600
Could've turned ugly.

01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:18.490
Instead, it's just a beautiful afternoon.

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:21.561
What do you say we get out of here?

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.045
Ever been on a hunter-killer, Beaman?

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:28.166
That's the last place I want to be.
Claustrophobic.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.521
You'll be okay,
as long as you don't jump out this time.
