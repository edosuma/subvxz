00:01.482 --> 00:02.655
<i>I thought
I had my whole life planned.</i>

00:02.655 --> 00:04.103
<i>But now I'm here.</i>

00:05.689 --> 00:07.724
<i>I'm just open
to the adventure.</i>

00:07.724 --> 00:10.310
I'm open
to having a connection
with a younger man.

00:12.206 --> 00:15.034
<i>I love older women
that can keep up with me.</i>

00:15.034 --> 00:17.482
I'm looking for love.
I need a grown woman out here.

00:17.482 --> 00:19.896
<i>I have
a very young, free spirit.</i>

00:19.896 --> 00:23.862
And I connect
to younger men,
especially in the bedroom.

00:23.862 --> 00:26.448
You are not
exactly on the show
you thought you were on.

00:26.448 --> 00:28.103
Hey!

00:28.103 --> 00:31.344
<i>You're about
to embark on a dating
experience like none other.</i>

00:31.344 --> 00:32.827
Err.

00:32.827 --> 00:34.724
Here we go.
Here we go.

00:36.413 --> 00:38.689
- What's going on?
- Wait.
They're our moms.

00:38.689 --> 00:39.965
Holy [bleep].

00:39.965 --> 00:43.206
I'm gonna have
to see my son date
these moms.

00:43.206 --> 00:45.689
<i>I don't want
to see who my mom's
trying to flirt on.</i>

00:45.689 --> 00:48.103
What did I get myself into?

00:48.103 --> 00:50.517
I'm not mad about my body.

00:51.482 --> 00:52.551
Sorry, ladies.

00:52.551 --> 00:54.482
I might be sleeping
with your son.

00:54.482 --> 00:58.000
<i>Kelle invested
a lot of time into her body,
her sex appeal.</i>

00:58.000 --> 00:59.896
<i>And I know that
young men want that.</i>

00:59.896 --> 01:02.758
It's a little much like
this isn't a game show.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.000
Pola.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.655
I get the fantasy
suite tonight.

01:06.793 --> 01:09.379
Kelle is not
the type of girl for Jose.

01:09.379 --> 01:12.758
I'm 100% sure,
she's not gonna get
anywhere with Jose.

01:12.758 --> 01:13.896
Never.

01:13.896 --> 01:16.000
You see his body
language, too. Look at it.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.275
<i>Whether she likes it or not.</i>

01:17.275 --> 01:19.689
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes
to take my man home.

01:19.689 --> 01:20.931
We got
to watch out for her.

01:20.931 --> 01:22.379
- It won't happen.
- But what if.

01:22.379 --> 01:23.655
No, I can't.

01:23.655 --> 01:24.896
I like to win.

01:24.896 --> 01:26.275
Oh, my God.

01:45.241 --> 01:47.620
<i>The sun is shining,
an amazing day.</i>

01:47.620 --> 01:49.827
And I just love
looking at the lady's bodies

01:49.827 --> 01:52.034
and I'm just getting
to know them.

01:52.034 --> 01:54.103
It's a good start
to the day.

01:55.551 --> 01:58.758
My mom does get
a lot of attention
from here up,

01:58.758 --> 02:02.620
mainly because
she never wears bras

02:02.620 --> 02:04.827
and the girls are always
popping out.

02:04.827 --> 02:07.344
You know, the headlights
are always on, so.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.793
It didn't bother you
when you were a baby
sucking on 'em either.

02:09.793 --> 02:11.931
So, let's keep it real.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.241
'Cause I needed
the milk, Mom.

02:13.241 --> 02:14.344
I needed some energy.

02:14.344 --> 02:15.586
You were really thirsty.

02:28.448 --> 02:31.724
From the places you've been,
which is your favorite place?

02:31.724 --> 02:34.413
So far, I love Costa Rica.

02:34.413 --> 02:36.413
- Yeah?
- I've only gone once.

02:36.413 --> 02:39.103
And when I went,
I went with somebody

02:39.103 --> 02:41.689
that I didn't really know,
but I'm like a risk taker.

02:41.689 --> 02:43.413
- I'll just do it, you know.
- Okay.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.620
I feel like
Jose is interested in me.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.103
Maybe I'm gonna
take a little bit more.

02:47.103 --> 02:48.413
- Baby, take whatever you want.
- No.

02:48.413 --> 02:49.620
Okay, fine.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.965
<i>But I feel like I need
to get him away from his mom.</i>

02:51.965 --> 02:53.413
She's great,
but she seems to be, like,

02:53.413 --> 02:55.517
showing up every time
I like, try and talk to him.

02:59.172 --> 03:01.310
I want to get a cup
for us for the drinks.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.379
Do you want another one?

03:02.379 --> 03:03.724
- I'll get one.
- All right.

03:04.862 --> 03:06.517
I need my drink.

03:06.517 --> 03:07.586
Yes.

03:08.517 --> 03:09.862
- So, Pola.
- Yes.

03:09.862 --> 03:12.000
I'm taking your son
out on a date.

03:12.862 --> 03:14.482
- You are?
- Yeah, why not?

03:14.482 --> 03:15.655
I haven't told him yet.

03:15.655 --> 03:17.000
No?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.206
I don't like to say
what I'm gonna say,

03:19.206 --> 03:24.172
but I really feel that
Kelle is, like, easy,
and I don't like that.

03:24.172 --> 03:28.000
I know for Jose
it's really important
to have values.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.344
<i>So, I really don't believe
Kelle is the right girl
for Jose.</i>

03:33.413 --> 03:34.517
When?

03:34.517 --> 03:36.689
I'm not telling you,
you'll interfere.

03:36.689 --> 03:38.965
I told your mom
I'm gonna take you out
on a date.

03:38.965 --> 03:40.586
Okay.
Let's go.

03:40.586 --> 03:43.241
She wanted to know
when, I said she can't know
'cause she'll interfere.

03:43.241 --> 03:45.517
She doesn't need to know.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.758
Because right now
we're all in the same villa.

03:47.758 --> 03:51.793
It's gonna be a little bit
difficult to separate
my mom and myself

03:51.793 --> 03:54.000
<i>in regards of dating
other women.</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:57.517
And so, I think
we have to get
a little bit creative.

03:58.689 --> 04:00.206
We're kicking
you out of your room, too.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.310
I don't see
Jose in a situation

04:05.310 --> 04:08.793
where he's dating a girl
like Kelle.

04:08.793 --> 04:12.137
He always dates
very quiet girls.

04:12.137 --> 04:14.275
And I think
she's really wild.

04:14.275 --> 04:17.896
So, I don't see
Jose going far with her.

04:18.448 --> 04:19.931
Never.

04:19.931 --> 04:22.448
Maybe we can rock,
paper, scissors over it.

04:22.448 --> 04:24.000
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.310
I think
Ryan is the most,
like, sexual like,

04:29.310 --> 04:31.758
would be like,
know what to do.

04:34.034 --> 04:35.103
Exactly.

04:35.103 --> 04:36.655
I mean, I don't mind
chasing, but I don't...

04:36.655 --> 04:38.896
I feel like I have to,
like, test it damn myself.

04:38.896 --> 04:39.965
No, you can't.

04:39.965 --> 04:42.034
Really...
Why should we have to do that?

04:46.310 --> 04:48.931
...because I have this list.

04:48.931 --> 04:52.896
Nobody fits in my list,
so nobody can keep up
with me, really.

04:52.896 --> 04:56.241
You're still sitting there
waiting like nothing's
ever come, so.

04:56.241 --> 04:57.689
You don't know
what you want, yeah?

04:57.689 --> 04:59.172
I do know...

04:59.172 --> 05:01.689
You might be closing
yourself off and nothing
can meet those standards.

05:01.689 --> 05:05.379
Well, that's why you have
to have a little standard
to get the right one.

05:05.379 --> 05:06.827
- Yeah.
- If you don't have
that standard,

05:06.827 --> 05:08.620
how are you gonna
have what you want?

05:10.034 --> 05:14.137
I feel like my first initial
thing was like Jose's.

05:14.137 --> 05:15.620
- Probably the most.
- Yeah. Yes, yes.

05:17.034 --> 05:18.965
<i>I think
Jose is hot.</i>

05:18.965 --> 05:22.137
<i>I already know
all of the moms here
love Jose.</i>

05:22.137 --> 05:23.689
<i>He's very intriguing.</i>

05:23.689 --> 05:26.206
He definitely gives me
the impression that
he knows

05:26.206 --> 05:28.034
what to do with a woman
in the bedroom.

05:28.034 --> 05:29.655
He knows how to take control.

05:29.655 --> 05:32.793
He has that get
the job done mentality.

05:32.793 --> 05:34.275
Mm-hmm.
That's how I feel.

05:34.275 --> 05:35.620
Oh, my God.
We had the same.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.689
Yeah.

05:42.689 --> 05:44.275
- That's a good spot.
- Mm-hmm.

05:44.275 --> 05:47.448
That's always a good
spot for every...

05:48.620 --> 05:50.034
Oh, wait, guys.

05:50.034 --> 05:52.275
- I got a text.
- You got to take it.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.344
I know.

05:53.344 --> 05:55.344
It's time to play
Wall of Secrets.

05:55.344 --> 05:58.448
If you can stump
your mom or son
with a secret

05:58.448 --> 06:01.172
that they don't know,
you win a romantic date.

06:01.689 --> 06:02.724
Oh.

06:02.724 --> 06:03.896
Oh, my God.

06:04.482 --> 06:05.793
Yeah. Yeah. Let's go.

06:05.793 --> 06:07.551
<i>Each week
we have a challenge</i>

06:07.551 --> 06:11.344
and this week
it's called Wall of Secrets.

06:11.344 --> 06:13.586
We're supposed to guess
our son's secret.

06:13.586 --> 06:15.758
The son is supposed
to guess our secret.

06:15.758 --> 06:18.793
<i>And if neither of us
guess each other's secret,</i>

06:18.793 --> 06:21.413
we win a date
with whoever we'd like.

06:34.172 --> 06:38.068
<i>So last night
we got a text that
we need to write down</i>

06:38.068 --> 06:42.068
some of our deepest,
darkest secrets that
no one knows about.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.103
What we didn't know
is that we're gonna be

06:45.103 --> 06:47.517
revealing these
to the entire house.

06:48.689 --> 06:50.689
Ooh.
This is crazy.

06:50.689 --> 06:55.241
And not only that,
but the secret that
we're sharing,

06:55.241 --> 06:59.172
we got to guess
if it's yours, if it's mine.

07:02.620 --> 07:05.448
The whole point
is to stump each other.

07:05.448 --> 07:07.241
I think I got this.

07:07.241 --> 07:09.517
Or I'm gonna just go up
and I'm gonna say

07:09.517 --> 07:11.965
whichever is the craziest
one I'm picking.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.000
I don't know,
you got April over there.

07:15.586 --> 07:16.896
Okay, here we go.

07:16.896 --> 07:18.551
- Wish me luck.
- Bye.

07:18.551 --> 07:20.551
Bye.

07:20.551 --> 07:22.068
She's so cute.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.206
Oh, here I am
at the Wall of Secrets.

07:25.206 --> 07:26.724
Okay.

07:26.724 --> 07:32.137
So, I had sex in a mall
elevator after watching
a late night movie.

07:33.344 --> 07:35.758
That actually sounds
like it would be fun.

07:35.758 --> 07:38.689
This one is just horrendous.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.896
I slept
with my son's best friend.

07:40.896 --> 07:42.620
That is just...

07:42.620 --> 07:44.344
That's...

07:44.344 --> 07:45.827
That's unacceptable.

07:45.827 --> 07:47.965
I started dating
a couple of women,

07:47.965 --> 07:50.655
but they were both
just a hit and quit.

07:50.655 --> 07:53.517
I never called them again.

07:53.517 --> 07:58.689
That better not be Gabriel,
because I did not raise
my Gabriel like that.

07:58.689 --> 08:02.137
But I know
which one would be Gabriel.

08:03.586 --> 08:07.344
Possibly Gabriel has had
a seven woman orgy.

08:07.344 --> 08:12.068
Not proud of it,
but that could be
my kid right there.

08:14.310 --> 08:15.862
Okay.

08:16.724 --> 08:18.655
This might be the walk
of shame here.

08:18.655 --> 08:22.034
I'd have to figure out
which one is Ryan's.

08:22.034 --> 08:25.000
He knows who I date
and what my type is.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.517
But you know things
about my sex life.

08:28.517 --> 08:30.137
- No.
- Yeah, I can do
without getting terms.

08:30.137 --> 08:31.517
I don't...
I don't share that with him.

08:31.517 --> 08:33.310
- I can do without
getting terms.
- I don't share that.

08:33.310 --> 08:34.862
And I don't want to know his.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.689
I had a quicky on a yacht
with a girl I just met.

08:37.689 --> 08:39.344
Yeah.

08:39.344 --> 08:42.206
Yeah, that could
potentially be him.

08:42.206 --> 08:45.000
When I was 16,
I had a three-way
with two girls

08:45.000 --> 08:46.103
at my mom's house.

08:46.103 --> 08:48.206
He better not have.
I hope that would not be him.

08:48.206 --> 08:49.896
I started dating
a couple of women

08:49.896 --> 08:53.724
but they were both
just a hit and quit it,
and I never called them again.

08:54.586 --> 08:56.310
He probably had ghosted them.

08:57.551 --> 09:00.517
I grinded on a grandma
and she liked it.

09:00.517 --> 09:01.862
Hmm.

09:01.862 --> 09:03.931
It says really hard. Okay.

09:03.931 --> 09:06.275
I got pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

09:06.275 --> 09:07.448
What?

09:07.448 --> 09:10.551
I got pink eye ass.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.137
I don't think my mom
would do that.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.793
I got a pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

09:15.793 --> 09:18.448
You could catch a lot
of freaking pink eyes and...

09:19.206 --> 09:20.310
Hmm.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.448
Salmonella.

09:21.448 --> 09:22.655
Salmonella?

09:22.655 --> 09:24.965
Yew.
Yeah, it's poop, you know.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.103
Oh, that...
that's definitely not my son.

09:27.103 --> 09:28.931
If he got pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

09:28.931 --> 09:31.241
Oh, my God, mom.

09:31.241 --> 09:32.965
Oh.

09:32.965 --> 09:35.896
I can look back
at the doctor records,
just saying.

09:35.896 --> 09:38.206
We got a [bleep] group
of people here.

09:40.896 --> 09:43.896
I dated my son's middle
school teacher.

09:43.896 --> 09:47.275
I mean, I wouldn't know this,
but that could be my mom.

09:47.275 --> 09:49.137
I started dating
a couple of women,

09:49.137 --> 09:52.137
but they were both
just a hit and quit.

09:52.137 --> 09:53.310
I never called them again.

09:53.310 --> 09:55.413
That's Jose.

09:55.413 --> 09:58.379
I've had sex
in public on a beach.

09:58.379 --> 10:01.862
My mom goes to a lot
of nude beaches, so.

10:01.862 --> 10:05.793
I had sex in a restroom
with a stranger.

10:05.793 --> 10:07.793
He was young and very hot.

10:07.793 --> 10:09.827
That's giving Kelle vibes.

10:09.827 --> 10:14.310
I had sex in the mall
elevator after watching
a late night movie.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.241
I think that might be my mom.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.758
She's kind of kinky like that.

10:17.758 --> 10:20.827
I'm interested
in seeing what he picked.

10:20.827 --> 10:24.137
I kissed
my male friend
for New Year's Eve,

10:24.137 --> 10:27.448
and that's when
he told me he was bisexual.

10:29.137 --> 10:30.551
Definitely could be my mom.

10:30.551 --> 10:33.206
I had a seven woman orgy.

10:33.206 --> 10:34.758
Are you kidding me?

10:35.448 --> 10:36.862
Could that be my mom?

10:36.862 --> 10:38.034
Oh, my. God.

10:38.034 --> 10:39.344
Oh, my God.

10:39.344 --> 10:40.448
What?

10:40.448 --> 10:43.068
Oh, my God.

10:46.241 --> 10:48.275
I make
the most out
of my elevator experience,

10:48.275 --> 10:49.862
you know that since
you were kids.

10:49.862 --> 10:51.275
- Oh, I...
- We jump, it's a whole thing.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.068
We jump.
It's too much information.

10:53.068 --> 10:55.137
I slept with my...

10:55.137 --> 10:59.034
Wait, I slept
with my son's best friend.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.482
Wow.
Okay.

11:00.482 --> 11:03.827
I think April W slept
with her son's best friend.

11:05.241 --> 11:07.689
That's either
April W or April J.

11:07.689 --> 11:09.034
Mine's...
mine's bad.

11:09.034 --> 11:10.758
Mine's bad, too.

11:10.758 --> 11:12.379
Which one's my mother?

11:20.793 --> 11:22.482
I got a text, everyone.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.896
Yay!

11:23.896 --> 11:26.551
Now that
you've all had a chance
to guess,

11:26.551 --> 11:29.344
it's time to reveal
who was able to stump
their mom

11:29.344 --> 11:32.620
or son with their deep,
dark secret.

11:33.310 --> 11:35.310
Everyone needs to fess up.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.482
Oh, my God.

11:36.482 --> 11:37.862
Seriously?

11:40.551 --> 11:44.551
I think potentially
these secrets could cause
drama because

11:44.551 --> 11:47.827
I think a lot of people
will use these secrets

11:47.827 --> 11:49.620
as a moment
to judge character.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.275
Oh, my gosh.

11:52.965 --> 11:55.931
I had a seven woman orgy.

12:03.965 --> 12:05.724
Well, I don't know
what they're talking about.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.482
You don't really like
the Spanish talk?

12:07.482 --> 12:08.586
No, I think it's rude.

12:08.586 --> 12:10.275
Honestly,
it's getting annoying.

12:10.275 --> 12:12.413
Are you guys done
speaking Spanish?

12:12.413 --> 12:14.586
She becomes like fire.

12:14.586 --> 12:16.310
You go speaking
when you're by yourself.

12:16.310 --> 12:17.379
It's fine.

12:17.379 --> 12:18.517
Like...

12:18.517 --> 12:20.000
Oh, no.
I'm the bad one.

12:27.482 --> 12:30.827
It's time to reveal
who is able to stump
their mom or son

12:30.827 --> 12:33.517
with their deep, dark secret.

12:35.620 --> 12:36.758
Oh, my God.

12:36.758 --> 12:37.827
Seriously?

12:38.931 --> 12:40.310
No, I don't know.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.965
I thought
I wouldn't have to say
which one was mine.

12:42.965 --> 12:47.965
And I feel very nervous
revealing my secret.

12:47.965 --> 12:51.689
I'm gonna start with my son,
Gabriel over here,

12:51.689 --> 12:53.724
and I hope it's not true, but...

12:54.689 --> 12:57.448
I had a seven woman orgy.

12:57.448 --> 12:58.862
Yes.

13:00.241 --> 13:01.724
Yes?

13:01.724 --> 13:02.862
- No?
- No.

13:02.862 --> 13:04.586
They're always all over you.

13:04.586 --> 13:06.275
Like I would tell you guys.

13:06.275 --> 13:07.344
No.

13:07.344 --> 13:08.482
Loser.

13:08.482 --> 13:09.689
No.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.379
I guessed that my mom
my middle school teacher.

13:16.448 --> 13:18.344
Why are you laughing?

13:18.344 --> 13:19.896
Was I right?

13:19.896 --> 13:21.344
I hope it's not true.

13:21.344 --> 13:22.448
No, you're wrong.

13:22.448 --> 13:23.896
Who would you think
that I would...

13:23.896 --> 13:25.206
Oh.

13:26.379 --> 13:28.000
That wasn't hers.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.068
I win.

13:29.068 --> 13:30.206
Yeah.

13:30.206 --> 13:31.724
Oh.

13:32.137 --> 13:33.931
We won.

13:33.931 --> 13:35.344
So, we stumped each other.

13:35.344 --> 13:37.068
- But...
-'Cause we always win.

13:37.068 --> 13:40.034
But does that mean
you're gonna hear
what my secret is?

13:40.034 --> 13:41.103
Oh, no.

13:41.103 --> 13:42.793
I better.
I think this is...

13:42.793 --> 13:44.689
Now we got to tell
each other our secrets.

13:44.689 --> 13:47.068
No, I don't want
to tell you my secret.

13:47.068 --> 13:50.517
Please tell me
your secret's not
the one of sleeping

13:50.517 --> 13:52.586
with your son's best friend.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.551
All right, April.

13:58.931 --> 14:00.068
Okay.

14:00.068 --> 14:02.275
Gabriel, do you want to...
cover your ears maybe?

14:02.275 --> 14:07.344
So, I was making a lot,
and I went with my boyfriend

14:07.344 --> 14:09.620
to our friend's house,
and I...

14:09.620 --> 14:12.310
I woke up
with his best friend.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.413
That's not that bad.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.241
Mine was kind of lame.

14:17.241 --> 14:19.758
I was on New Year's once,
and I was surrounded by,

14:19.758 --> 14:22.241
like, my best friend
and all his, like, sisters.

14:22.241 --> 14:24.965
And it's just like
And I was like...

14:24.965 --> 14:26.068
I was like

14:26.068 --> 14:27.586
Like I've never kissed
a guy before.

14:27.586 --> 14:28.931
So, like,
we kissed for a second.

14:28.931 --> 14:31.413
I stopped,
and then he was like,
why did you stop?

14:31.413 --> 14:33.103
And he loved it.

14:33.103 --> 14:36.586
And then ever since then,
I think that's how he kind
of realized maybe he like...

14:36.586 --> 14:37.931
likes everyone.

14:37.931 --> 14:39.931
So that was the bisexual.

14:39.931 --> 14:41.931
Oh.

14:41.931 --> 14:44.517
<i>I'll be honest,
though, you got to take
your hat off to that.</i>

14:44.517 --> 14:48.068
If you can be enlightening
enough to tell somebody

14:48.068 --> 14:50.586
you made them
realize their sexuality

14:50.586 --> 14:54.103
<i>and like pretty much
give credit to yourself
in that,</i>

14:54.103 --> 14:56.620
like that's a hell
of a egotistical transition.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.413
Like, that's...
that's crazy.

14:58.413 --> 15:01.379
I... I would say
he has a pretty healthy ego.

15:01.379 --> 15:02.724
Yeah.

15:02.724 --> 15:04.482
Help me, Jesus.

15:04.482 --> 15:05.965
Come on, Stephany.

15:05.965 --> 15:09.517
So, the one
I picked for Billy was...

15:09.517 --> 15:12.793
I've had sex in public
on the beach.

15:12.793 --> 15:14.344
Yeah.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.655
He's always
at the beach.

15:17.655 --> 15:18.862
He's always
at the beach?

15:18.862 --> 15:20.413
Always.

15:20.413 --> 15:24.137
Billy's secret was sex
on the beach is kind of
a little enticing

15:24.137 --> 15:26.172
since the beaches, right?

15:26.758 --> 15:28.655
Enticing?

15:28.655 --> 15:29.724
Wha...

15:30.551 --> 15:32.655
Enticing.

15:32.655 --> 15:35.241
The one
I had for my mom is

15:35.241 --> 15:38.758
I dated my son's
middle school teacher.

15:39.862 --> 15:41.724
- He got it.
- Oh.

15:43.379 --> 15:44.413
He got it.

15:44.413 --> 15:45.655
- They won.
- Nope.

15:45.655 --> 15:46.965
We got it.

15:46.965 --> 15:49.034
They thought
they guessed it right
that they won.

15:49.034 --> 15:50.310
But it...
But it was the opposite.

15:50.310 --> 15:52.137
And they actually lost.

15:52.482 --> 15:53.620
Charlene.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.241
Okay, so it's my turn, guys.

15:55.241 --> 16:01.931
I guessed for Harrison
that he said I grinded
on a grandma and she liked it.

16:03.620 --> 16:04.793
Oh, my God.

16:11.310 --> 16:14.034
Back
when I was a dancer,
a male entertainer.

16:14.793 --> 16:16.241
Whoa.

16:22.655 --> 16:24.310
That piqued my interest.

16:24.310 --> 16:25.413
That's all I got to say.

16:25.413 --> 16:27.413
I was like I need a date
with Harrison.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.965
<i>So, we know it's in him.</i>

16:30.965 --> 16:33.931
It's like, who's just
gonna pull it out of him
is the question.

16:33.931 --> 16:35.206
Well, he pulled it out.

16:37.793 --> 16:41.206
The secret that I guessed
for my mom was that

16:41.206 --> 16:43.965
she kissed my male friend
for New Year's Eve

16:43.965 --> 16:46.137
and that's when he told me
he was bisexual.

16:46.793 --> 16:48.586
- Whoa.
- No.

16:48.586 --> 16:50.758
See I said I hooked up
with the 23-year-old,

16:50.758 --> 16:52.620
and I might not have
remembered his name.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.000
Oh.

16:56.758 --> 16:58.137
So did we win?
Like...

16:58.137 --> 16:59.551
No.
You guessed mine right.

16:59.551 --> 17:00.758
Yeah.
I mean, come on.

17:00.758 --> 17:01.896
You were a dancer, right?

17:01.896 --> 17:04.172
Well, actually,
the word is male entertainer.

17:04.172 --> 17:07.310
Well, stripper
or male entertainer.

17:07.310 --> 17:08.689
Okay, next one.

17:08.689 --> 17:10.000
Kelle.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.827
Oh, Joey.

17:13.827 --> 17:15.379
For Joey, I...

17:15.379 --> 17:19.689
I guessed I had sex
in a mall elevator after
watching a late night movie.

17:21.068 --> 17:24.379
No.

17:24.379 --> 17:26.620
Joey ain't that cool.

17:27.862 --> 17:29.517
Mine was the hit it
and quit it.

17:29.517 --> 17:34.275
I hit it and quit it
within the first couple
of days.

17:34.275 --> 17:38.206
Multiple girls
and I never talked
to them again.

17:39.482 --> 17:41.517
Oh.

17:41.517 --> 17:44.827
All right. The one that
I guessed for my mother was...

17:49.482 --> 17:53.000
I have had sex
in public on the beach.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.517
- No.
- Really?

17:54.517 --> 17:56.965
- No, that wasn't...
- Really?

17:56.965 --> 18:02.655
Mine was I had sex
in a Michelin restaurant
in London with a stranger.

18:02.655 --> 18:03.896
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

18:03.896 --> 18:06.586
So that's why
you've been going
to Europe for so long?

18:07.241 --> 18:08.517
I like her.

18:08.517 --> 18:09.620
- So...
- We stumped each other.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.689
- ...I guess...
- So, we won.

18:10.689 --> 18:11.758
I guess we won.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.896
- We won.
- Yeah.

18:12.896 --> 18:14.413
We didn't lose.
We won.

18:14.413 --> 18:16.000
Well, who are you
taking on a date?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.206
I don't know.

18:23.862 --> 18:26.034
I was, like,
actually pretty shocked

18:26.034 --> 18:28.275
when it came
to Kelle's secret.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.000
I thought it would be
a little bit more exciting.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.586
I actually thought that
it would definitely be

18:33.586 --> 18:36.413
the one that she slept
with her son's best friend.

18:36.413 --> 18:37.551
Really?

18:37.551 --> 18:40.344
I thought it might have
been the seven woman orgy.

18:43.172 --> 18:47.896
So, I guessed for Ryan
that he's dated
a couple of women,

18:47.896 --> 18:50.517
that he just hit it
and quit it and never
called them again.

18:50.517 --> 18:51.862
- Yay!
- Nope.

18:51.862 --> 18:53.551
No.
Just...

18:56.103 --> 19:00.827
I was involved
with seven women
in a one-time situation

19:00.827 --> 19:04.137
for a night for my birthday.

19:04.137 --> 19:07.586
I knew he was like
a man whore,
but not on that level.

19:09.551 --> 19:11.000
And everybody was happy.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.275
I'm not gonna lie, Ryan.

19:12.275 --> 19:14.206
That's pretty dope.

19:14.206 --> 19:17.655
Pretty sure all the guys
in the room are pretty
jealous of you right now.

19:17.655 --> 19:18.931
Lord, help me.

19:18.931 --> 19:21.137
I need a beverage after that.

19:21.137 --> 19:23.000
Maybe grossed out.

19:23.931 --> 19:28.448
I would never guess
in 10,000 years.

19:28.448 --> 19:30.172
That's a lot of years.

19:30.172 --> 19:36.068
That's before Christ and some,
that you would have been
with seven women at one time.

19:36.448 --> 19:37.655
Never.

19:37.655 --> 19:39.310
Seven days in a week.
Yeah, seven doors.

19:39.310 --> 19:40.827
No, no.

19:41.758 --> 19:42.827
All right.
Where you at?

19:42.827 --> 19:45.068
So pre your dad...

19:45.068 --> 19:48.413
pre your dad,
guy I was dating,

19:48.413 --> 19:52.310
went to the movies
and had a nice time
at the elevator.

19:57.206 --> 20:00.103
And I'm just
thankful that the pressure
of winning a challenge

20:00.103 --> 20:02.172
is now off of me.

20:02.172 --> 20:05.310
I can't unhear your escapades.

20:05.310 --> 20:06.620
At least you didn't see.

20:06.620 --> 20:07.793
Thank God.

20:10.172 --> 20:11.413
At least you didn't see.

20:11.413 --> 20:12.724
Whoosah.

20:12.724 --> 20:14.172
All right, now I go.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.241
All right,
all right, all right.
All right.

20:16.241 --> 20:18.275
Let me
pick up Jimmy's secret.

20:18.275 --> 20:19.620
Okay.

20:19.620 --> 20:22.413
Oh, I got pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

20:24.965 --> 20:26.172
Yeah.

20:27.206 --> 20:28.965
Real, real, real.

20:28.965 --> 20:30.344
Real.
Do it.

20:33.103 --> 20:34.137
I do it.

20:34.137 --> 20:35.793
It's a normal thing.

20:36.310 --> 20:37.517
What?

20:38.137 --> 20:39.482
Not the pink eye part.

20:39.482 --> 20:42.655
That just happens 'cause
when you're going up
and down,

20:42.655 --> 20:44.068
up and down,
back and forth.

20:46.793 --> 20:50.793
When Jimmy
starts talking to us
about what he did, I...

20:50.793 --> 20:55.000
I was like thinking about
what he was doing
and how he was doing it.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.620
So, it was a little bit
complicated just to take
him out of the picture

20:58.620 --> 21:00.586
and just see Jimmy as Jimmy.

21:02.551 --> 21:05.344
But I'm glad
he didn't kiss me in our date.

21:05.862 --> 21:06.965
After what...

21:06.965 --> 21:08.689
what I heard
about Jimmy doing.

21:08.689 --> 21:10.068
No.
No way.

21:12.103 --> 21:13.344
Oh, my God.

21:13.344 --> 21:15.000
The commotion in this room.

21:15.827 --> 21:16.896
All right, all right.

21:16.896 --> 21:18.827
This is what I guessed
for my mom.

21:18.827 --> 21:20.862
- I guessed...
- I don't know
if you could guess, though.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.344
I kissed my male friend
New Year's Eve,

21:23.344 --> 21:25.310
and that's when he told me
he was bisexual.

21:25.310 --> 21:26.448
Nope.

21:26.448 --> 21:27.586
And...

21:27.586 --> 21:29.827
Well,
we don't even know
our mom's crazy.

21:29.827 --> 21:31.137
You guys don't know your mom.

21:31.137 --> 21:32.965
- We don't know our mom.
- All right.

21:32.965 --> 21:36.620
Amma.
Amma.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.862
I don't want to explain.

21:37.862 --> 21:39.172
I'm just gonna answer.
How's that?

21:39.172 --> 21:40.310
Explain.

21:40.310 --> 21:42.241
- No.
- Explanation.

21:42.241 --> 21:43.724
No, I don't want
to explanation.

21:43.724 --> 21:45.896
Everybody explained.

21:45.896 --> 21:47.689
Well, start
and then we'll see.

21:50.620 --> 21:54.172
Okay.
My secret is I slept
with your best friend.

21:54.172 --> 21:55.586
Whoa.

22:10.068 --> 22:14.068
Okay. My secret is
I slept with your best friend.

22:14.068 --> 22:15.862
Whoa.

22:17.517 --> 22:20.655
There's no way.

22:20.655 --> 22:21.793
Did you know that?

22:21.793 --> 22:22.862
No.

22:22.862 --> 22:24.551
Does it look like
I knew that.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.379
This is something
I never saw coming.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.206
I did not expect this at all.

22:28.206 --> 22:29.379
0%.

22:29.379 --> 22:31.758
<i>And I thought
I knew my mom really well.</i>

22:31.758 --> 22:33.413
I don't know
what to think about it.

22:33.413 --> 22:36.413
Look, look,
I don't need an explanation.

22:36.413 --> 22:38.379
I'm a little traumatized
right now.

22:38.379 --> 22:39.724
I'm not gonna lie.

22:39.724 --> 22:41.517
We thought Ryan was a savage.

22:42.344 --> 22:44.137
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:44.137 --> 22:46.275
We're all in shock.

22:46.275 --> 22:50.034
Joey's best friends
kind of have been with him
since elementary school.

22:50.034 --> 22:52.413
That would be a boundary
I would never cross.

22:54.965 --> 22:57.206
Why would
you put that down?

22:57.206 --> 22:58.413
I knew
you're not gonna get it.

22:58.413 --> 22:59.689
Okay.
So, say it.

22:59.689 --> 23:03.620
So, I put it down because
I thought,
you're not gonna get it.

23:03.620 --> 23:04.931
You want me to...

23:09.896 --> 23:12.034
Soyoung likes them so young.

23:12.034 --> 23:13.586
Are we done?

23:13.586 --> 23:16.068
That's the most
savage thing I think
anyone did.

23:16.068 --> 23:17.310
Yes.

23:17.310 --> 23:19.068
It was so cold, though.

23:19.068 --> 23:22.586
The winners
of our Wall of Secrets
challenge are...

23:23.275 --> 23:24.551
<i>Ryan and Shannon,</i>

23:27.137 --> 23:28.551
<i>Kelle and Joey,</i>

23:31.241 --> 23:33.206
Gabriel and April.

23:33.206 --> 23:34.655
You are the three... Wait.

23:34.655 --> 23:37.379
You are the three
mother son duos
who stumped each other.

23:37.379 --> 23:40.896
And now for your prize,
Ryan, Joey and Gabriel.

23:40.896 --> 23:44.724
You won a group date
next week and will be
able to take whoever you want.

23:51.655 --> 23:55.275
I'm excited that
we have won something finally.

23:55.275 --> 23:57.137
Something.
Ooh.

23:57.137 --> 24:00.620
By way of us winning
and how we won, I'm horrified.

24:02.448 --> 24:04.448
- You see?
- We finally win something.

24:12.482 --> 24:14.896
Just finished
the Wall of Secrets.

24:15.862 --> 24:17.379
Damn.

24:17.379 --> 24:19.758
It's not what I thought
it would be like at all.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.517
Honestly, this one hits deep.

24:22.517 --> 24:23.655
This one...

24:23.655 --> 24:25.482
This one I did not see
coming at all.

24:25.482 --> 24:26.931
Honestly.

24:26.931 --> 24:28.862
Hmm.
My mom...

24:30.000 --> 24:33.206
she really dropped
one on me that.

24:33.206 --> 24:36.448
You know, it's just like
I don't even want to know
something like that.

24:36.448 --> 24:38.965
I feel like she should've took
that to her grave
or something.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.344
I don't really know
what to feel.

24:42.344 --> 24:43.551
I don't know how I feel.

24:43.551 --> 24:46.344
I hope nobody
really talks about it.

24:46.344 --> 24:49.931
I don't want to know about
who it was with

24:49.931 --> 24:52.000
or even hear about it
anymore honestly.

24:52.827 --> 24:54.620
Right now [bleep].

25:03.137 --> 25:04.965
I think
Jimmy's having a hard time

25:04.965 --> 25:07.896
because he wasn't ready
for his mom's secret,

25:07.896 --> 25:11.724
and I feel like Harrison
would be acting the same way.

25:24.344 --> 25:26.241
- Mia.
- What?

25:26.241 --> 25:27.344
Let's go to bed.

25:27.344 --> 25:28.620
Amma.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.586
Life's crazy.

25:30.586 --> 25:31.862
It's crazy.

25:33.068 --> 25:34.586
No.

25:42.931 --> 25:44.827
Yes.

25:46.172 --> 25:47.586
No.
No.

25:50.413 --> 25:52.000
Um, honestly.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.241
I'll listen to you.

25:56.586 --> 25:57.827
No, it's not about talk.

25:57.827 --> 26:00.241
Everything's understood.
Everything is.

26:00.241 --> 26:02.448
When I go in the room
we're not gonna talk.

26:02.448 --> 26:03.931
I understand.

26:03.931 --> 26:05.413
Okay.
And it's okay.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.793
Ah, it's not too far.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.448
You haven't seen too far.

26:10.448 --> 26:12.068
You don't live in my world.

26:12.068 --> 26:14.068
- You've never seen too far.
- Okay. Okay.

26:14.068 --> 26:15.413
Go home.

26:28.206 --> 26:29.758
Right?
Look.

26:31.689 --> 26:34.827
It gets...
it gets difficult in life, right?

26:36.827 --> 26:37.965
It's surreal.

26:37.965 --> 26:40.137
And you know what,
you want to run away.

26:42.586 --> 26:43.793
Hmm.

26:45.206 --> 26:47.862
I didn't expect
this at all, really.

26:50.586 --> 26:52.275
<i>I feel guilty.</i>

26:57.517 --> 26:59.310
But I'm a human.

26:59.310 --> 27:00.655
I'm a woman, too.

27:00.655 --> 27:03.000
I mean, if...

27:08.931 --> 27:11.517
<i>I'm hoping
he will forgive me.</i>

27:27.931 --> 27:32.206
Either Pola is a helicopter
mom or a jealous wife.

27:32.206 --> 27:33.862
He likes what he likes.

27:35.206 --> 27:37.000
Yes, he does.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.551
I'm zero jealous.

27:38.551 --> 27:40.172
I'm really not jealous at all.

27:51.620 --> 27:53.137
I have a surprise for you.

27:53.896 --> 27:55.310
It is intriguing.

27:55.310 --> 27:57.793
<i>Even though
we did not win this challenge,</i>

27:57.793 --> 28:00.413
I've gotten to arrange
a date for Jose and I.

28:00.413 --> 28:02.379
I feel like I need
to get him away
from his mom

28:02.379 --> 28:06.310
because she like seems to be,
like showing up every time
I like try and talk to him.

28:06.310 --> 28:10.000
I know you're from Mexico,
so I planned, like,
a little date for us.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.137
Okay.

28:11.137 --> 28:13.517
To show you one
of the landmarks of Mexico.

28:13.517 --> 28:14.793
Okay. Which... which is...

28:14.793 --> 28:16.275
Can't tell you.
You're gonna see when we...

28:16.275 --> 28:17.379
Okay, I'm excited.

28:17.379 --> 28:18.965
Yeah.
And we're going by boat.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.551
Okay.
Amazing.

28:21.310 --> 28:22.758
Thank you, <i>senorita</i> Kelle.

28:22.758 --> 28:24.275
It's fun.

28:24.275 --> 28:27.517
I'm not sure
what kind of surprise
she has for me,

28:27.517 --> 28:32.034
but I really liked that Kelle
took initiative to go
on a date.

28:32.034 --> 28:34.241
I found that quite sexy.

28:34.241 --> 28:37.655
<i>I think that my mom
would have some
reservations about her,</i>

28:37.655 --> 28:41.689
but I'm pretty sure my mom
would appreciate a woman
taking care of her son

28:41.689 --> 28:43.034
and being thoughtful.

28:44.034 --> 28:45.379
I got it.

28:48.655 --> 28:49.827
Look at the service.

28:49.827 --> 28:51.172
- Wow.
- Ah.

28:51.172 --> 28:52.620
Five star service.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.000
Thank you. Hi.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.620
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

28:55.620 --> 28:57.551
Since Jose is from Mexico.

28:57.551 --> 29:00.482
<i>I want to take him
to one of the biggest
landmarks in Mexico,</i>

29:00.482 --> 29:02.068
<i>which is a mushroom rock.</i>

29:02.068 --> 29:06.551
<i>I've set up this date
because I'm hoping that
my efforts that</i>

29:06.551 --> 29:10.241
I'm putting into this date,
I hope he actually sees that
I'm really interested in him.

29:12.931 --> 29:15.000
So, this is the place
that you brought me?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.758
- Yeah.
- This is the mushroom rock.

29:16.758 --> 29:18.551
- Yeah.
- I've seen that online.

29:18.551 --> 29:20.103
I...
I wanted to come here.

29:20.103 --> 29:21.931
- Do you love it?
- Yeah, I love it.

29:21.931 --> 29:23.862
Thank you. And I'm happy
to share this with you.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.413
Like, I'm really,
really happy.

29:25.413 --> 29:29.172
Kelle has a very strong
personality, and that's
something that I admire.

29:29.172 --> 29:32.551
But also,
she has a very caring
loving side.

29:32.551 --> 29:35.034
I like that she's beautiful
and thoughtful.

29:35.034 --> 29:38.275
And I might want to see
more of that softer side.

29:40.241 --> 29:42.517
So, I want to talk
about things that...

29:43.310 --> 29:45.379
that are amazing about you.

29:45.379 --> 29:46.517
- About me?
- Yeah.

29:46.517 --> 29:49.172
That caught my...
my attention a lot.

29:49.172 --> 29:51.827
Like the... the way that
you manage your space,

29:51.827 --> 29:53.931
how you shine
wherever you go,

29:53.931 --> 29:57.586
how you stick to your gut,
to yourself.

29:57.586 --> 30:00.551
So, it's very admirable.

30:00.551 --> 30:02.620
- I'm glad you like it.
- For sure.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.931
I actually...

30:08.275 --> 30:09.586
Um, I don't really know
what to say.

30:09.586 --> 30:11.931
You actually make me
a little bit speechless sometimes.

30:11.931 --> 30:13.068
- Why?
- Which is rare...

30:13.068 --> 30:14.620
because I always
have a good comeback...

30:14.620 --> 30:16.862
- something to say?
- ...or something silly
or something funny to say.

30:16.862 --> 30:19.275
But, um, I don't know,
I'm just really drawn to you.

30:19.275 --> 30:23.000
So, I feel like
I get a little bit of nervous
or something around you.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.517
Which is weird.

30:24.517 --> 30:28.206
I'm glad that we do have
this time to get to know
each other better because,

30:28.206 --> 30:30.758
you know, I think
very highly of you.

30:30.758 --> 30:32.413
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

30:32.413 --> 30:36.068
And I adore your mom,
so I would love for her
to be my mother in law when...

30:37.413 --> 30:39.344
<i>I don't get hit on a lot
when I go out</i>

30:39.344 --> 30:41.137
<i>and I feel like a lot
of people tell me that</i>

30:41.137 --> 30:44.517
I'm a very intimidating person
which I feel it's so hard
for me

30:44.517 --> 30:45.862
to believe because I'm...

30:45.862 --> 30:48.620
I don't really feel like
I give off that persona.

30:48.620 --> 30:51.758
But with Jose,
giving me a list
of amazing attributes of me.

30:51.758 --> 30:54.275
I'm not used to somebody
doing that,
especially on a first date.

30:54.275 --> 30:58.896
So, it was really exciting to,
you know, hear
how he felt about me.

31:00.620 --> 31:01.862
Oh-oh.

31:05.517 --> 31:06.620
Knew that was coming.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.275
The way you were
looking at me that whole time.

31:08.275 --> 31:09.482
Yeah?

31:10.793 --> 31:13.448
Now I'm just like, whoo!

31:13.448 --> 31:16.620
<i>I feel like he was feeling
what I was feeling
at the same moment.</i>

31:16.620 --> 31:18.413
<i>He left me wanting more.</i>

31:18.413 --> 31:20.137
<i>That's all I could say.</i>

31:20.137 --> 31:24.344
So far, being alone,
with us in the water
has been amazing.

31:24.344 --> 31:27.068
Being here and seeing
this beautiful sunset and...

31:27.068 --> 31:28.827
and how beautiful you look.

31:28.827 --> 31:31.413
This is a really special
moment as well.

31:58.724 --> 32:01.413
No, he's okay.
He's a man now.

32:01.413 --> 32:03.344
Yes.
He's a man.

32:04.793 --> 32:08.379
He's a man now.

32:09.965 --> 32:11.827
Yeah, but he likes
what he likes.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.068
Yes, he does.

32:15.068 --> 32:18.310
It's really
important for me to have
a good man by my side.

32:18.310 --> 32:19.758
So, I want the same
for Jose,

32:19.758 --> 32:22.896
I want him to find
a nice girl for him.

32:22.896 --> 32:24.172
Where's everybody?

32:26.758 --> 32:28.137
He been gone for 5 hours.

32:28.137 --> 32:29.517
He obviously like something.

32:32.172 --> 32:33.655
Hola.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.137
Oh, you guys look good.

32:39.517 --> 32:41.000
Spill the cheese.
Spill the cheese.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.137
Hola.

32:42.137 --> 32:43.241
Spill the cheese?

32:43.241 --> 32:45.068
Yeah, you guys were
gone for a long time.

32:45.068 --> 32:46.172
Yes.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.517
Any intimacy?

32:47.517 --> 32:49.068
- And...
- No?

32:50.034 --> 32:51.206
Now throw
her the question.

32:51.206 --> 32:53.137
You don't
kiss and tell,
what you're gonna do.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.448
<i>I don't even know
what to say.</i>

32:54.448 --> 32:55.931
My mom is there.

32:55.931 --> 32:59.862
I had... I had a great
time, but I don't know
how to express myself.

32:59.862 --> 33:03.551
Everything is blowing
my mind, honestly.

33:03.551 --> 33:05.379
Okay. Okay. Okay, listen.

33:05.379 --> 33:07.965
Since Jose is from Mexico,
I took him to like,

33:07.965 --> 33:10.206
one of the biggest
landmarks of Mexico.

33:10.206 --> 33:12.448
- Yeah.
- And we had the most
amazing time.

33:12.448 --> 33:13.896
What landmark is it?

33:13.896 --> 33:16.103
It's called the mushroom...
the mushroom rock.

33:16.103 --> 33:17.586
Ah, I wanted to go there.

33:18.620 --> 33:19.793
We talked about it.

33:19.793 --> 33:21.241
Yeah.

33:22.655 --> 33:24.241
Maybe next time
you can take me.

33:24.241 --> 33:25.931
- No.
- Yeah.

33:25.931 --> 33:27.206
Well,
we had a great time.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.551
It was really,
really amazing.

33:28.551 --> 33:30.137
Yeah.

33:30.137 --> 33:31.413
It's fine.
I'm... I'm fine.

33:31.413 --> 33:32.551
I'm fine with it.

33:32.551 --> 33:33.793
I'm zero jealous.

33:33.793 --> 33:35.862
I'm really not jealous
at all.

33:35.862 --> 33:37.310
It was a boat for two?

33:37.310 --> 33:38.862
Yeah.
It was a boat for us.

33:38.862 --> 33:41.344
So, you guys got
a hotel room or something?

33:41.344 --> 33:44.965
A gentleman
never speaks about that
stuff with anybody else.

33:44.965 --> 33:46.310
That's why I love you.

33:46.310 --> 33:50.344
Pretty sure Jose
is not on this retreat
to date his mama.

33:50.344 --> 33:51.448
Wham.

33:51.448 --> 33:52.793
We're jealous.

33:52.793 --> 33:57.275
Either Pola is a helicopter
mom or a jealous wife.

34:05.172 --> 34:07.896
Okay.
No speaking in Spanish,
we don't know.

34:07.896 --> 34:09.862
The majority doesn't know
what you're saying.

34:09.862 --> 34:11.344
I don't know
what they're talking about,

34:11.344 --> 34:12.827
that they can't speak
in English.

34:12.827 --> 34:14.379
You're exploiting people.

34:14.379 --> 34:15.551
It what's you're doing.

34:15.551 --> 34:17.275
But it has nothing
to do with you.

34:17.275 --> 34:18.517
What is wrong with her?

34:29.413 --> 34:31.862
You really can't beat
tacos and tequila.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.103
Is there a shrimp
taco somewhere?

34:34.103 --> 34:35.275
That's a beef.

34:35.275 --> 34:36.379
That's beef.

34:36.379 --> 34:38.000
It ain't nowhere.

34:40.379 --> 34:43.551
We finally get to see
the house let loose.

34:52.137 --> 34:57.275
I didn't think
Soyoung would be so, you know,
active about her dance moves.

34:57.275 --> 34:59.517
I mean, she really
started going crazy.

34:59.517 --> 35:01.000
<i>It blew me away.</i>

35:01.758 --> 35:03.068
'Cause she's Soyoung.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.241
Yeah.

35:23.620 --> 35:26.965
I think Mama Pola
forgot to cut
the umbilical cord

35:26.965 --> 35:28.068
when he was born.

35:28.068 --> 35:29.275
I feel like
it's uncomfortable,

35:29.275 --> 35:32.620
Jose to date me,
like with his mom right there.

35:32.620 --> 35:35.724
<i>Clearly, there's some
sort of attachment disorder</i>

35:35.724 --> 35:37.620
going on between
Pola and Jose.

35:37.620 --> 35:39.000
So, I'm like...

35:45.655 --> 35:46.862
Jose.

35:49.206 --> 35:50.379
Okay.

35:52.413 --> 35:53.413
Pola.

35:54.793 --> 35:56.103
Go.

35:56.103 --> 35:59.103
<i>I'm frustrated with myself
for not knowing Spanish</i>

35:59.103 --> 36:02.724
because Jose and Pola
are speaking Spanish
very fluently

36:02.724 --> 36:04.413
'cause it's like their
first language.

36:05.896 --> 36:08.482
I don't know
why she's staring at us
so much.

36:08.482 --> 36:09.586
- I don't know.
- Like... did I...

36:09.586 --> 36:11.482
did I any...
Did I do anything wrong?

36:11.482 --> 36:12.724
I mean,
you didn't do anything.

36:12.724 --> 36:14.551
- So, what... What's going on?
- I don't know. I don't know.

36:17.931 --> 36:19.000
They're...

36:19.000 --> 36:21.068
Well, I don't know
what they're talking about.

36:21.068 --> 36:23.655
Maybe they're talking
about us, but it's like
I just...

36:23.655 --> 36:25.172
I just want to be
a part of whatever.

36:25.172 --> 36:26.827
Yeah. You want to...
you want to be in the know.

36:28.344 --> 36:30.862
She would take my bed,
and then I'll sleep
on the couch.

36:34.206 --> 36:37.172
Pola and Stefany
and Jose are speaking Spanish.

36:37.172 --> 36:39.482
You know,
and their little group
is definitely making

36:39.482 --> 36:41.482
everybody feel uncomfortable.

36:41.482 --> 36:43.206
<i>For me, I want to know
what you're saying.</i>

36:43.206 --> 36:46.344
And if you don't want me
to know, then, like,
go somewhere else.

36:46.344 --> 36:49.068
Okay.
No speaking in Spanish,
we don't know.

36:49.068 --> 36:51.068
The majority doesn't know
what you're saying.

36:52.655 --> 36:54.068
I spoke Spanish and English.

36:55.275 --> 36:56.758
I don't know.

36:57.896 --> 36:59.551
You don't really like
the Spanish stuff?

36:59.551 --> 37:01.206
No, I think it's rude.

37:01.206 --> 37:02.793
I don't know
what they're saying.

37:02.793 --> 37:04.965
I think it's disrespectful, honestly.

37:05.827 --> 37:07.068
Are we speaking in German?

37:07.068 --> 37:08.310
Oh.

37:13.586 --> 37:14.965
Yeah, dude. Enough.

37:14.965 --> 37:16.379
Come on.
We don't know.

37:16.379 --> 37:17.586
We don't know
what you're saying.

37:17.586 --> 37:19.172
- English, Stefany. English.
- Not fair.

37:19.172 --> 37:24.448
The fact that Pola
keeps speaking in Spanish
with Stef and Jose,

37:24.448 --> 37:26.034
I don't know what
they're talking about that

37:26.034 --> 37:27.896
they can't speak
in English about.

37:27.896 --> 37:30.448
So, it's honestly,
it's getting annoying.

37:32.862 --> 37:34.413
Oh.

37:34.413 --> 37:36.413
Are you guys done
speaking Spanish?

37:37.896 --> 37:38.965
- It's rude.
- No.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.068
I'm telling you it's rude.

37:40.068 --> 37:41.448
Oh, no, no.

37:41.448 --> 37:43.137
It's just a bad habit.

37:43.137 --> 37:44.310
- Bad habit.
- It's rude.

37:44.310 --> 37:46.206
It's my first language.
Our first language.

37:46.206 --> 37:47.551
But you're not...

37:47.551 --> 37:49.586
you're not here to speak
your first language.

37:52.206 --> 37:54.517
But it's rude
when you do that
in front of other people

37:54.517 --> 37:55.758
like Ricky or me.

37:55.758 --> 37:57.172
Do you speak Spanish?

37:57.172 --> 37:59.103
No, but we're...
we're translating with Ricky.

37:59.103 --> 38:00.965
But they're translating.

38:00.965 --> 38:02.344
Yeah, we translate.

38:02.344 --> 38:05.344
We... Well, whatever
they want you to think
that they're saying.

38:05.344 --> 38:07.103
No, no, no.
We're not that kind of people.

38:07.103 --> 38:10.068
We won't do that to you,
to you or to anyone.

38:10.068 --> 38:12.827
Listen, if had anything
bad to say to you,
I'll tell it to your face.

38:12.827 --> 38:14.241
I'm not gonna
translate to her.

38:14.241 --> 38:15.413
Come on.

38:15.413 --> 38:17.827
What is wrong with her?
Why can't we speak Spanish?

38:17.827 --> 38:20.103
I'm telling you,
if we have something
to say bad, we'll tell her.

38:21.448 --> 38:25.827
I mean,
maybe she is self-conscious, insecure.

38:25.827 --> 38:27.172
I don't know.

38:30.896 --> 38:32.793
It's not about me thinking
you're talking about me.

38:32.793 --> 38:34.965
Just ask us.
It's about respect.

38:34.965 --> 38:36.482
Next time...
next time...

38:36.482 --> 38:38.482
You know, we'll create
a group setting where
everyone speaks English...

38:38.482 --> 38:40.206
Usually
when I speak that language...

38:40.206 --> 38:43.310
when I talk, I'm next to her,
I'm gonna talk to her Spanish.

38:44.827 --> 38:46.965
<i>I hear a lot
of screaming downstairs</i>

38:46.965 --> 38:49.965
and I hear Kelle is the one
that's screaming.

38:49.965 --> 38:53.448
<i>She's still going around
the same thing about
the language barrier.</i>

38:53.448 --> 38:55.482
This is so dramatic
and unnecessary.

38:55.482 --> 38:56.793
<i>I should stop this.</i>

38:56.793 --> 38:58.241
Oh,
what are you talking about?

38:58.241 --> 39:00.379
- So, it's fine.
- What is the matter?
We speak languages.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.655
Then go speak it
when you're by yourself.

39:02.655 --> 39:04.482
No.

39:11.931 --> 39:16.758
Seeing that situation,
it actually showed
a little bit on the other side

39:16.758 --> 39:19.448
the darker side of Kelle
that I didn't know.

39:19.448 --> 39:21.931
<i>And I don't find it attractive.</i>

39:30.344 --> 39:31.689
<i>If I have
something to say,</i>

39:31.689 --> 39:33.689
I don't need to talk
to somebody else in Spanish.

39:33.689 --> 39:35.034
I'll tell her directly.

39:35.034 --> 39:37.655
<i>I actually...
I never even thought of this.</i>

39:37.655 --> 39:39.034
We're in Mexico.

39:39.034 --> 39:40.413
We could speak Spanish.

39:40.413 --> 39:43.206
And if you don't understand,
too bad.

39:45.103 --> 39:46.896
Kelle, where are you?

39:46.896 --> 39:48.275
It's me, Stef.

39:48.275 --> 39:49.517
Hey.
I'm sorry.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.103
I don't want you
to feel like that.

39:51.103 --> 39:53.517
I swear we're not talking
bad about you.

39:53.517 --> 39:55.793
No, you guys are like
laughing at me.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.724
Why would
we laugh about you?

39:57.724 --> 40:00.241
No, because you're like,
oh, we would never,
like talk about you.

40:00.241 --> 40:01.931
It has nothing to do
with you.

40:01.931 --> 40:06.137
I could speak Spanish
all day with her,
here, down there.

40:06.137 --> 40:09.517
But I think
there's other people
that maybe if they just...

40:09.517 --> 40:11.206
Okay. Well, then
have them come to me.

40:11.206 --> 40:12.413
Because her
and I are talking...

40:12.413 --> 40:14.103
- But you guys don't care.
- ...about family and kid...

40:14.103 --> 40:15.413
You guys don't care.

40:18.034 --> 40:19.482
- Right. But that's not...
- She's still...

40:19.482 --> 40:21.586
Yeah.
But don't...

40:21.586 --> 40:23.827
don't capture that energy.

40:23.827 --> 40:26.103
She becomes like fire.

40:26.103 --> 40:27.413
Like it's...

40:27.413 --> 40:29.827
I don't like people
being disrespectful.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.689
- I'm not like that.
- I know.

40:31.689 --> 40:33.206
- So, I don't feel comfortable.
- I agree, I...

40:33.206 --> 40:34.793
She's shouting at me,
just like...

40:36.206 --> 40:37.689
I'm not used
to people like that.

40:37.689 --> 40:38.931
Right.

40:38.931 --> 40:40.827
Like, I feel
I'm really well educated.

40:40.827 --> 40:42.517
I mean, we can talk,
we can speak.

40:42.517 --> 40:44.034
- It's fine.
- Yeah.

40:44.034 --> 40:48.310
Like, the action of it
is just shouting without
a reason or anything.

40:48.310 --> 40:50.862
- You're exploiting people.
It's what you're doing.
- No.

40:50.862 --> 40:52.517
- No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
- Oh, you all are.

40:52.517 --> 40:53.965
- It's what you're doing.
- No.

40:53.965 --> 40:58.448
It's starts to give me
some second thoughts
about her.

40:58.448 --> 41:01.241
Hopefully you're gonna
meet another woman
from there

41:01.241 --> 41:03.689
and leave Kelle just
by its side.

41:04.103 --> 41:05.137
By side.

41:06.379 --> 41:07.758
Hopefully.

41:12.551 --> 41:14.344
Cool.
Now I'm the bad guy.

41:15.482 --> 41:18.482
I'm not the bad guy,
'cause I don't speak Spanish.

41:29.793 --> 41:32.827
We want you to come up
with a dance that best
communicates design.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.103
The shirt comes off
and all the ladies go crazy.

41:41.620 --> 41:44.689
<i>So, I'm excited
for my first date,
I get to go out the villa.</i>

41:44.689 --> 41:47.655
I've never been
on a double date
with my mom before.

41:47.655 --> 41:52.137
I would have never thought
that I would be here
with such a beautiful woman.

41:52.137 --> 41:55.655
I honestly
can't remember the last time
I had so much fun on a date.

41:55.655 --> 41:57.310
He's trying to hit
on my mom

41:57.310 --> 41:58.827
and it's not sitting
right with me.

42:01.620 --> 42:04.827
To me, personally, you're
the most intriguing person
in the house.

42:04.827 --> 42:06.655
I want to be with Jose.

42:06.655 --> 42:08.206
- I love my son.
- Okay.

42:08.206 --> 42:13.241
It is a bit of mama's boy
going on with Jose and Pola.

42:13.241 --> 42:16.862
They don't really have
the right sized condoms
for me here.

42:17.896 --> 42:19.655
He said he has a big [bleep].

42:19.655 --> 42:20.965
How does it make you feel?

42:26.241 --> 42:28.034
He's already
asking my girl on a date.

42:28.034 --> 42:29.344
Who?
You and I?

42:29.344 --> 42:33.206
I do Gabriel a lot,
but I'm a little confused
at this point.

42:35.551 --> 42:37.689
It's about to get
a little more dramatic.
