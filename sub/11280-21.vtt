CHRIS ROCK:
When I was in school,

00:04.572 --> 00:06.574
students usually got
recognition

00:06.607 --> 00:09.243
for one of two things:
being really good...

00:09.277 --> 00:14.215
This year's Valedictorian
is Stephanie Borelli.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.551
...and being really bad.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.387
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

00:19.420 --> 00:20.721
but your son is an idiot.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.393
I was usually somewhere
in the middle.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.528
Until it came to algebra.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.364
Chris, are you
paying attention?

00:30.398 --> 00:31.665
Can't you see I'm trying
to sleep?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.601
Yes.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.070
It's a simple
two-step equation.

00:36.104 --> 00:40.174
Minus nine X, plus one,
equals minus 80.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.742
What is x?

00:41.775 --> 00:44.545
89?

00:44.578 --> 00:45.579
Eighty-no.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.681
Monkey toe.
Greg?

00:47.715 --> 00:50.184
X equals positive nine.
Correct.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.320
Why didn't you just ask him
in the first place?

00:54.355 --> 00:57.191
* And the long hall
and the gray walls... *

00:57.225 --> 00:58.759
Chris?

00:58.792 --> 01:01.195
I need to talk to you.
Yes?

01:01.229 --> 01:05.399
You realize this week
is our pizza competition.
I know.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.535
Every year, the math
classes at Corleone

01:07.568 --> 01:09.403
competed for a pizza day.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.671
Next to the last day of school,

01:10.704 --> 01:12.340
it was everybody's
favorite day.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.708
At my old school, if you got
a high score in math,

01:14.742 --> 01:16.577
all you got was this...

01:16.610 --> 01:18.379
An "A" in math?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.714
I bet that "A" won't keep
me from kicking your ass.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.784
Now, Chris, my request for
the school to provide you

01:23.817 --> 01:27.555
with an alternate victory meal
of ribs and pigs' knuckles

01:27.588 --> 01:29.657
was denied, but I know

01:29.690 --> 01:33.394
as well as you do that you
loves you some pizza, right?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.496
Uh... right.

01:35.529 --> 01:39.567
Well, I'd like
our class win, but...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.569
if you don't get your average
up, that's not going to happen.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.572
But I'm trying.
I just don't get algebra.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.274
Maybe you could tutor
me after school.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.376
I'm sorry, Chris.
I don't have time.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.511
Have you called
the United Negro College Fund?

01:50.544 --> 01:51.412
Maybe they can help.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.647
History would later
prove her wrong.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.383
All I'm trying to say is:

01:55.416 --> 01:58.619
if you don't get algebra,
we don't get pizza.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.721
And I'm gonna get sliced.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.891

PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION

02:33.954 --> 02:35.656
You've got to come
through for us, dude.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.625
Remember last year how
we could smell the pizza

02:37.658 --> 02:39.227
coming down the
hall and then...

02:39.260 --> 02:40.428
passing us by
and leaving us

02:40.461 --> 02:41.962
like the last helicopter
out of Saigon?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.398
Greg had watched First Blood
on TV the night before.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.899
I don't want to go
through that again.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.668
So, what? You're
going to help me?

02:47.701 --> 02:50.404
I'd like to, but I'm already
tutoring six other dumb kids.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.672
Plus, my aunt's
over this week.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.407
She's got something
planned with the family

02:53.441 --> 02:54.475
every night this week.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.478
Tonight we're driving
over the Verrazano Bridge.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.912
Maybe someone
else can help you.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.481
Nobody here is
going to help me.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.849
You gotta do something.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.417
I want that pizza.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.419
Greg, you eat
pizza every day.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.455
Yeah, but this is free.
Hey, Major Harris...

03:08.522 --> 03:09.923
if you mess up our
pizza day,

03:09.957 --> 03:11.259
I'm gonna smack the crust
out of you.

03:11.292 --> 03:15.329
Since it wasn't the first time
I'd had problems with algebra,

03:15.363 --> 03:18.299
I figured the best thing
to do was to get help.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.734
Hey, baby. I thought you
had to work today.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.403
I asked Doc for the day off.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.438
Why
algebra.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.341
We have this pizza day coming up
and we can't win

03:27.375 --> 03:28.476
unless I bring up
my test score.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.611
Is that how they get you to pass
your classes these days,

03:30.644 --> 03:32.313
is by giving you pizza?

03:32.346 --> 03:34.615
I guess if they gave you steak,
you'd be headed to class.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.850
And if they gave you chicken,
you'd open up the Apollo.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.686
So you think I could get
an algebra tutor?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.755
An algebra tutor

03:41.789 --> 03:45.626
Now, there are six units and 12
tenants in this building.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.296
If "X" equals the number of
units with televisions,

03:48.329 --> 03:50.398
and "Y" equals the people who
are at work right now,

03:50.431 --> 03:52.266
how many TVs can we steal?

03:52.300 --> 03:54.868
Hmm?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.738
You know, your grandmother
was a great algebra teacher.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.373
Oh, that's right.
I forgot about that.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.908
So you think she can
work with me?

04:00.941 --> 04:02.843
You could work with me--
I know algebra

04:02.876 --> 04:04.412
like the back of my hand.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.547
Which will probably end up
upside my head.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.848
So you're going to tutor me?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.950
You want that pizza, don't you?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.051
Yeah.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.553
Besides, I don't want my mother

04:12.586 --> 04:13.554
thinking my kids are dumb.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.688
Your kids?
What about her kid?

04:14.722 --> 04:17.358
Because of the crack trade,
it was a lot harder

04:17.391 --> 04:19.393
for Risky to make money
on the streets.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.061
He couldn't make money
on electronics.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.731
This is a brand
new VCR-- $30.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.401
I'll sell you 30 for $1.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.569
He couldn't make money
on clothes.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.404
This is nice.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.340
It's real leather, $50.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.842
I'll sell this one
to you for a $1.50.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.378
He couldn't even make
money on food.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.580
One Bomb Pop. Two dollars.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.315
Sell you a lick
for a nickel.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.717
So Risky took his biggest
risk of all.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.052
He got a job.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.520
You 10 minutes late.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.556
Sorry, man. Look, I
appreciateyou hiring me,

04:48.589 --> 04:50.891
but I haven't had a regular
job in ten years.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.093
But, hey-- I'm here
and I'm ready.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.363
Yeah. Ready to give my father
high blood pressure.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.366
Look, I'd like to help you out,

04:58.399 --> 05:00.300
but be late tomorrow,
and that's it.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.079
Tanya loved her TV time.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.815
And to her, TV time meant
no Drew time.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.388
What do you think you're doing?
I'm sitting down.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.423
You can't sit in Daddy's chair.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.791
You're the one taking up
the whole couch.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.359
So? Sit on the floor.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.460
I don't want to sit
on the floor.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.728
Well, I'm telling Daddy.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.397
Telling Daddy what?

05:33.867 --> 05:36.504
Telling Daddy that you
broke his chair.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.040
You are going to be
in so much trouble.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.842
You're sure you
can't do this?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.512
I can't. My cousin from south
Jersey wants to drive me

05:44.545 --> 05:46.514
around Brooklyn and listen
to "Born in the USA."

05:46.547 --> 05:48.482
What?
It's a long story.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.451
But, I've gotta get
some help with this.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.420
I don't get it.
If your mom knows algebra,

05:52.453 --> 05:54.154
why don't you want
her to tutor you?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.590
'Cause when I'm working with
her, I never learn anything.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.591
She's like Bobby Knight.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.427
All she does
is scream and point.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.828
But I stuck with it,

06:00.861 --> 06:03.030
sure that my hard work
would pay off.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.132
No! No! What
are you doing?

06:05.165 --> 06:08.836
N plus five over minus
16 equals minus one.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.004
What's the answer?
I don't know.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.909
No, no, no!

06:15.943 --> 06:17.110
The other side.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.178
What difference does it make?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.414
What difference does it make?

06:20.448 --> 06:21.949
Note to self: when dealing with

06:21.982 --> 06:23.551
the irrefutable
scienceof numbers,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.653
don't ask "What difference
does it make?"

06:25.686 --> 06:28.922
If you put it on that
side, it's wrong.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.658
That's the difference.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.526
No!

06:34.495 --> 06:36.497
Wrong!

06:36.530 --> 06:37.631
That's wrong!

06:37.665 --> 06:38.766
Incorrect!

06:38.799 --> 06:39.833
Uh-uh!

06:39.867 --> 06:42.470
No! Incorrect! Eh! Wrong!

06:43.837 --> 06:45.606
Since when does Y equal X?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.007
Are you crazy?!

06:47.040 --> 06:49.577
X does not equal Y!

06:49.610 --> 06:53.146
You carry the
two over the N.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.516
How hard can it be?!

06:55.549 --> 06:57.851
God, Chris, what kind
of answer is that?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.186
The kind you come up with,

06:59.219 --> 07:00.921
with a crazy woman
screaming at you.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.591
You know, maybe Grandma
can help me. We could call her.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.560
No, because she's gonna to tell
you the same thing.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.596
If you can add and
subtract, you can do this.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.499
My mother applied that logic
to a lot of situations.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.767
If you can crack an egg,
you can crack a safe.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.006
Boy, if you can
lace up a sneaker,

07:19.039 --> 07:20.608
then you can
stitch up a chest.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.576
Suture!

07:25.012 --> 07:28.081
If you can jump rope,
you can jump from a plane.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.150
Go!

07:30.183 --> 07:32.686
Oh! Baby!

07:32.720 --> 07:35.022
You forgot your parachute!

07:37.625 --> 07:40.528
No, no! If you
multiply on one side,

07:40.561 --> 07:43.597
you have to multiply
on the other side.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.065
That moment was the closest
I ever came

07:45.098 --> 07:46.567
to giving up
and hitting the pipe.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.101
Mom, can we please take a break?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.103
:
Okay, baby.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.640
You know what? I think we're
getting a little closer.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.508
I can feel it.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.010
If it's utter despair,
I can I can feel it, too.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.650
While I was trying to find
an answer to my problem,

08:02.683 --> 08:05.252
Drew was trying to dodge
a problem with his answer.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.526
Somebody been sitting
in my chair?

08:12.560 --> 08:15.028
Middle bear.
I don't know. Why?

08:15.062 --> 08:17.097
It's broken, that's why.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.533
Broken

08:19.567 --> 08:21.234
I don't know. I didn't break it.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.936
Are you sure?

08:22.970 --> 08:25.272
'Cause you could've
just broken just now
when you sat down.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.175
Tonya, you been sitting
in my chair?

08:28.208 --> 08:31.011
If that were me, Tonya would've
been telling already.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.246
But for Drew, she had
something better in mind.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.749
Yeah, I sat there.
What happened?

08:35.783 --> 08:37.184
I think you broke it.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.720
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.254
That's all right.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.823
I think I can fix it.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.128
How come you didn't tell?

08:48.161 --> 08:51.565
Because you're going to do
whatever I tell you to do.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.635
And if you don't,
then I'm gonna tell.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.337
Now go get me
some popcorn.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.040
Go ahead.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.243
I wonder if that's how
Hillary Clinton got started.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.347
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.951
So I got going
to grandma's house.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.724
Chris, what are
you doing here?

09:16.757 --> 09:19.359
Hi, Grandma. I need your help.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.861
What's the problem?

09:20.894 --> 09:24.765
Mama, plus me,
times algebra, equals you.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.705
Going behind my mother's back
to get help from my grandmother

09:31.739 --> 09:32.940
made me feel guiltier

09:32.973 --> 09:34.808
than Janet Jackson
at a half-time show.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.143
Don't feel bad, Chris.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.612
I taught Rochelle
everything she knows,

09:38.646 --> 09:40.748
but I didn't teach her
everything I know.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.616
Teaching is a skill.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.752
No different than
flying a plane.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.887
Except you don't fall 35,000
feet to your death.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.623
How come you didn't come to me
in the first place?

09:49.657 --> 09:51.391
She didn't want you to think
that she couldn't do it.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.293
Mm-hmm.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.697
So, I guess you just want
to keep this between me and you.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.833
Could we?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.935
My father had
given Risky a job,

10:01.969 --> 10:05.138
which was turning out
to be a job in itself.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.674
Hey, what's happening, Cooper?

10:06.707 --> 10:07.908
Hey, Coop,
how you doing, man?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.042
Hey.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.845
Let me get a large coffee
and, uh, two butter rolls.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.647
I'm sorry, man.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.748
No coffee today.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.750
What

10:16.784 --> 10:19.219
Somebody broke into
the truck again last night.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.789
Stole the coffeemaker,
they stole the coffee,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.423
they stole the sugar,
they stole the creamer,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.425
they stole the straws,
they stole the stirrers,

10:25.458 --> 10:26.860
they even stole
the Sweet'N Low.

10:26.894 --> 10:27.928
All they left me

10:27.961 --> 10:32.099
was three bags of
Earl Grey tea... and these cups.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.035
I can give you the water, but
you have to heat it yourself.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.204
What if I give you
a new coffeemaker?

10:37.237 --> 10:38.305
Fifteen bucks.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.439
Fifteen bucks?!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.374
Last time, you only
charged me ten.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.944
The time before that,
you charged me 20.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.213
And both times, they looked like

10:46.246 --> 10:47.314
the same
coffeemaker.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.782
What are you doing?

10:48.816 --> 10:49.649
What?
I'm just trying

10:49.683 --> 10:51.451
to make a little extra
money on the side.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.120
Your job here
is unloading papers,

10:53.153 --> 10:54.454
not selling stolen coffee pots.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.057
It's not stolen, it's recovered.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.425
Yeah.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.293
And if you stop
recovering them from me,

11:00.327 --> 11:02.129
I could stop
recovering them for you.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.164
When you're with me,

11:04.197 --> 11:06.734
you got one job:
unloading papers.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.068
I'm not trying
to hurt nobody, man.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.236
We're all in this together.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.038
It's the business cycle.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.306
If he can't sell coffee,
you can't sell papers,

11:13.340 --> 11:15.375
next thing you know,
we're all out of a job.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.477
Twelve bucks!

11:17.510 --> 11:21.014
This time, I want the
coffeemaker, I want a pistol,

11:21.048 --> 11:22.716
and I want some No-Doze.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.153
Go get the coffeemaker.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.490
While Risky was doing
the soft sell,

11:30.523 --> 11:32.860
Tonya was taking a hard line.

11:32.893 --> 11:33.727
Hey, Drew.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.228
What?

11:35.262 --> 11:36.897
My shoe's untied.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.198
So what?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.399
So tie it.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.401
I'm not tying your shoe.
You tie it.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.269
Nah, that's okay.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.104
Maybe I'll just wait
till Daddy gets home

11:44.137 --> 11:46.740
and I'll ask him if
he wants to tie it.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.076
Okay, I'll tie it.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.711
Put it in a bow.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.749
Thank you.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.351
It's a good thing
she can't read minds.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.354
Just because my grandmother
was better at teaching math,

12:01.388 --> 12:03.924
didn't mean I was any better
at learning it.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.826
You're doing that wrong.

12:05.859 --> 12:06.794
What do you mean?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.762
Chris, are you paying attention?

12:08.796 --> 12:09.930
I thought I was.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.464
Pizza is not the only thing

12:11.498 --> 12:13.834
you won't be getting
if you don't pass this class.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.770
What? You want to grow up
to be a toll booth operator?

12:16.804 --> 12:18.906
I did, but E-ZPass
took all the jobs.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.842
What am I gonna have to do
to get you to understand this?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.143
How much longer
do we have to work?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.444
Now, why do you ask?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.146
'Cause the Mets
are about to play.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.982
Oh, so you like baseball, huh?

12:32.519 --> 12:33.520
What's all this?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.824
Ah, well, I figured while
you sell the newspapers,

12:36.857 --> 12:38.826
I open up a whole
new customer base.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.228
How about I open up your skull
with a tire iron?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.897
I can't drive around with a
truck full of stolen goods.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.165
Uh-uh! I'm not a thief.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.199
I'm a wholesaler.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.101
Cut out
the middle man.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.569
How about you cut out
the bail man?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.038
'Cause that's what
we're gonna need.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.339
Have you ever known me to be

12:52.372 --> 12:53.841
in trouble with the law?
Come on, now.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.909
Have you ever known me
to sell radios

12:55.943 --> 12:57.144
out the back of a paper truck?

12:57.177 --> 13:00.013
I'm sorry.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.815
Look, let me just
move this stuff today,

13:01.849 --> 13:04.251
and after that, it'll be
newspapers and only newspapers.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.387
One day.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.488
And that's it.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.891
Thank you.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.960
How much for this?

13:12.993 --> 13:15.362
Back home, my mother
was looking at my test,

13:15.395 --> 13:18.098
and she didn't like the score.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.834
"X" over "2Y",
over square root...

13:20.868 --> 13:24.337
I know I showed him
how to do this right.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.206
Meanwhile, I was
finally getting

13:26.239 --> 13:27.474
into the swing of things.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.342
Okay, Chris, in
yesterday's game,

13:29.376 --> 13:33.947
Darryl Strawberry batted .500
with six at bats.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.115
How many hits did he get?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.451
Okay, "A" equals
the number of at bats,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.587
which is six.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.522
And "B" equals
the batting average.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.624
Which is?
.500.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.996
And .500 equals "H",

13:49.029 --> 13:51.231
which is the number
of hits over six.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.934
So if you multiply both sides
of the equation by six,

13:53.967 --> 13:58.338
you will see that
the number of hits is...

13:58.371 --> 13:59.506
three.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.507
That's right.

14:01.608 --> 14:02.876
You got three in a row!

14:02.910 --> 14:04.644
Can we do another one?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.080
Okay, you work out another one.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.117
Get this door...

14:12.352 --> 14:13.386
Rochelle?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.255
Mama, I need
your help.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.289
Chris?

14:16.323 --> 14:17.624
Ma?

14:17.657 --> 14:19.526
Stay tuned for
the exciting conclusion

14:19.559 --> 14:21.561
of As The Ghetto Turns.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.533
CHRIS:
When my mother found out

14:26.566 --> 14:28.335
I was going behind
her back for tutoring,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.203
she was her usual
understanding self.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.939
Chris, how come you
just didn't say something

14:31.972 --> 14:33.506
instead of sneaking around?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.575
I mean, what else are you
learning on the side?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.144
English History?

14:37.177 --> 14:38.078
Where does it stop?!

14:38.111 --> 14:40.047
One day, she caught me
speaking Latin

14:40.080 --> 14:41.481
and kicked me out of the house.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.682
I'm sorry, Ma.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.117
I just needed to get some help.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.519
Oh, so I just rassled you
to the ground

14:46.553 --> 14:47.520
and stopped you from learning?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.990
Rochelle, all you did
was holler at the boy.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.524
My mother was
hollering at her boy

14:51.558 --> 14:53.593
long before it was cool
to holla at your boy.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.661
Is that what you told her?

14:54.694 --> 14:57.097
He didn't have to tell
me, Rochelle, I know you.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.098
You are impatient.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.032
You couldn't teach a rock

14:59.066 --> 15:00.567
how to hit the ground
if you dropped it.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.436
Now, all you got to do
is fall straight down.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.438
Ow!

15:05.472 --> 15:07.340
Didn't I tell you
to hit the ground?!

15:07.374 --> 15:10.077
Are you saying I don't know
how to raise my children?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.678
See, that's another thing:
you don't listen.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.080
Well, if he just
did what I said,

15:13.113 --> 15:14.081
we wouldn't have a problem!

15:14.114 --> 15:15.315
I did what you said.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.316
That's why we're here.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.550
Did you hear what I said?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.086
Better yet,
do you hear yourself?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.353
So, Mama, are you telling me

15:20.387 --> 15:22.089
I don't know what I'm doing?
Yes.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.057
Don't ask me, ask him.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.059
I'll tell her,
and you tell everyone

15:26.093 --> 15:28.061
my last words were
"Thanks a lot, Grandma."

15:28.095 --> 15:30.330
So you're just gonna stand
there, look me in my face

15:30.363 --> 15:31.999
and tell me I didn't help you,

15:32.032 --> 15:33.233
not one little
teeny, tiny little bit.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.401
Yes!
No.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.568
No?
Yes?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.537
Oh.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.573
Okay, well, I'm gonna take
my little behind home.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.112
I had reached the end
of my rope,

15:45.145 --> 15:47.047
and Risky had reached
the end of the road.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.749
Hey, Julius.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.118
Man, where's your uniform?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.986
Yeah, I got to talk
to you about that.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.222
Man, look, I told you, we're not
selling your stuff out here.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.090
Uh...

15:57.124 --> 15:58.458
I'm not going out with you.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.592
I'm gonna have to quit.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.029
Quit? Man, we got work to do!

16:02.062 --> 16:04.297
You can't just up and quit every
time you don't like something.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.765
It works for Terrell Owens.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.167
This ain't my thing.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.701
I'm a businessman.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.238
You can't compete with these
crackheads around here.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.305
You told me that.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.540
Yeah, I know, I know.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.707
Well, what you gonna do?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.776
Get off the streets.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.145
Open up a storefront.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.212
Go legit.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.780
A business?
Yeah.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.682
You?
Yeah!

16:22.715 --> 16:25.085
That's kind of risky, ain't it?

16:25.118 --> 16:27.087
Yeah.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.789
What's in the box?

16:29.822 --> 16:33.693
This is that new stereo
you were looking at.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.128
My way of
saying thanks.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.064
:
I appreciate it.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.099
Ah, stop, man, stop.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.200
It's $20.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.301
What?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.070
It was $50.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.172
Back home, Tonya was continuing

16:45.205 --> 16:48.341
to undo the work
of Abraham Lincoln.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.043
Drew, hand me
the remote.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.078
No.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.079
I'm sick of you.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.713
You get it.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.116
Daddy!

16:56.149 --> 16:57.217
Go ahead, call him.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.119
What are you gonna tell him,
that I broke his chair?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.153
Yep.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.423
But you told him you did it.

17:03.456 --> 17:06.726
So if you tell him I did it, I'm
gonna tell Mama you lied on me.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.629
And you're gonna have to tell
her either you lied this time

17:09.662 --> 17:10.730
or you lied that time.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.499
And either way, you lied.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.735
So if I get a beating from him,

17:15.768 --> 17:18.205
you're gonna get
a beating from her.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.174
So you want to tell or you want
to get up and get that remote?

17:23.676 --> 17:27.614
Drew stamped Tonya's blackmail
"Return to sender."

17:27.647 --> 17:28.748
What is it?

17:28.781 --> 17:31.050
Never mind.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.758
Oh, and, uh, while you're up,

17:38.791 --> 17:40.193
make sure you get me
some popcorn.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.163
One standoff down, one to go.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.332
Ma

17:45.365 --> 17:46.866
I'm fine.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.800
You're not mad?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.103
No. Why would you think that?

17:50.137 --> 17:53.373
Because those mashed potatoes
just started bleeding.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.475
You know I didn't mean
to upset you.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.476
Who's upset?

17:56.509 --> 17:57.710
I'm not upset.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.479
You want to learn algebra
with your grandma,

17:59.512 --> 18:01.181
that's fine by me.
It is?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.182
No, it's not.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.184
Why would you go running
to her instead of me?

18:04.217 --> 18:06.119
What was wrong with the
way I was teaching you?

18:06.153 --> 18:07.520
Everything.
Nothing.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.521
Something.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.357
It's just that the way

18:10.390 --> 18:12.425
you were teaching me,
I couldn't get it.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.362
Well, I was doing
the best I could.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.197
I know, and that's okay.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.266
Because there's a lot of
other things I learn from you.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.367
Yeah?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.468
Yeah, like, uh,

18:21.501 --> 18:23.170
don't put plaids
and stripes together.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.638
And don't leave fake leather
on the radiator,

18:25.672 --> 18:27.607
'cause it'll melt.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.642
And don't answer
the phone past 7:00,

18:29.676 --> 18:31.444
because it's probably
a bill collector.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.446
The advice about white girls
was priceless.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.549
I'm sorry, baby.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.818
I just wanted to be
the one to help you.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.153
How's everything going?

18:40.187 --> 18:41.154
Better.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.255
Mm-mm, better's not good enough.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.556
We're calling your grandma.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.259
My mother hated to ask
my grandmother for help.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.928
So I knew I had a choice:
learn or die.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.932
Okay, "10N"
equals 40.

18:52.965 --> 18:53.933
"N" equals four.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.502
Huh.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.605
Nine plus "9X" equals nine.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.474
"X" equals zero.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.709
Okay.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.812
144 equals minus 12

19:05.845 --> 19:08.181
times "X" plus five.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.885
Minus 17.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.722
Oh! Good job, baby.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.257
"3N"

19:17.290 --> 19:20.293
minus five equals

19:20.327 --> 19:22.929
negative-eight
times six

19:22.962 --> 19:24.664
plus "5N".

19:26.666 --> 19:27.700
"N" equals negative one.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.369
Oh!

19:29.402 --> 19:31.871
Look like somebody
gonna get some pizza!

19:31.904 --> 19:33.973
If all studying were
rewarded with pizza,

19:34.006 --> 19:36.509
then Charles Barkley
would've won a Nobel Prize.

19:36.543 --> 19:40.347
We waited for the results
of the test.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.349
But I knew for sure that I had

19:42.382 --> 19:43.583
knocked it out of the park.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.619
Chris, you got
every single answer wrong.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.687
What?!

19:47.720 --> 19:50.323
Because of you,
we don't get pizza.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.993
Calm down, everybody!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.263
Guys!
Nice going, mud bone.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.231
Wait, how could I get
every single one wrong?

19:58.265 --> 19:59.332
There must be some mistake.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.333
There was.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.468
Unfortunately, you made it.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.336
You answered question
one on line two.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.306
Subsequently, all the answers
that followed were wrong.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.341
Isn't that how Bush
got elected?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.810
If you hadn't done that,
you would've scored 100.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.979
But you did, so you didn't.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.647
This where the pizzas go?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.449
:
Oh.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.623
* Everybody hates Chris.
