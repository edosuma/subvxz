                  a good choice.

01:10.472 --> 01:13.074
    It's a witty revamp of

05:07.626 --> 05:10.027
were not called                 
the, uh, Minutemen after all.   

05:10.061 --> 05:12.697
  Oh, like every history book   
     is then wrong, right?      

05:12.732 --> 05:15.299
 Oh, they were actually called  
        the <i>Minute</i> Men.         

05:16.468 --> 05:17.836
         A lot of them          
     under three feet tall,     

05:17.870 --> 05:19.070
      as a matter of fact.      

05:19.105 --> 05:20.288
             Right.             

05:20.322 --> 05:21.722
      Way back in history,      
      people were shorter.      

05:21.757 --> 05:23.057
        All right, fine.        

05:23.092 --> 05:23.808
  Take, for example, the, uh,   

05:23.843 --> 05:25.060
the Knights of the Round Table. 

05:25.094 --> 05:26.294
                        Yeah?   
    Genuine midgets.            

05:26.328 --> 05:30.215
You're a very lonely man,       
          aren't you?           

05:32.634 --> 05:35.036
  Julie, sweetheart, come on,   
  it's the middle of winter.    

05:35.071 --> 05:36.671
          You're going          
     to have to bundle up.      

05:36.706 --> 05:38.974
    I don't know, pack          
  a wool bikini, or something.  

05:39.008 --> 05:40.208
        All right.              

05:40.242 --> 05:41.810
         ( <i>chuckling</i> ):         
         Okay, bye-bye.         

05:41.844 --> 05:43.677
Whee. All right.                

05:43.712 --> 05:45.280
    Julie is set.               

05:45.314 --> 05:46.381
            Sammy, come here.   

05:46.415 --> 05:47.848
              Let me see if I   
              got this straight.

05:47.883 --> 05:49.050
    What?                       

05:49.084 --> 05:50.385
                Drake invited   
                you and Rebecca.

05:50.419 --> 05:51.386
    Mm-hmm.                     

05:51.420 --> 05:54.389
        Uh, Rebecca's got the   
        major hots for Drake.   

05:54.423 --> 05:56.757
             You take Julie     
             instead of Rebecca.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.794
        Rebecca is left standing
        alone on the dock.      

05:59.828 --> 06:01.829
                Hey, what's that
                in her hand?    

06:01.863 --> 06:05.266
                Oh, must be your
                severed head.   

06:05.301 --> 06:06.500
Uh, don't worry about it.       

06:06.535 --> 06:09.170
Rebecca's not even going        
to find out she was invited.    

06:09.204 --> 06:11.572
     Well, Sam, looks like      
  we're going to be shipmates.  

06:11.607 --> 06:13.908
    What do you mean?           

06:13.943 --> 06:16.261
    I just saw Evan outside,    
 and he told me the good news.  

06:16.295 --> 06:17.662
I'm going to be your date.      

06:17.696 --> 06:18.913
    Uh, well, here... uh...     

06:18.948 --> 06:20.181
            here's the bad news.

06:20.215 --> 06:22.416
            I've already invited
            somebody else.      

06:22.451 --> 06:23.768
    Un-invite her.              

06:23.802 --> 06:25.603
Sam, I have been dying          

06:25.637 --> 06:27.171
for this chance                 
to get to know Evan             

06:27.206 --> 06:28.339
in a social setting.            

06:28.373 --> 06:29.607
He only sees me                 

06:29.641 --> 06:32.060
as some tough businesswoman     
in tailored suits.              

06:32.094 --> 06:34.029
I want him to see me            
in sportswear.                  

06:34.063 --> 06:36.881
                 No... you don't
                 understand.    

06:36.916 --> 06:38.750
            See, Julie is really
            important to me.    

06:38.784 --> 06:40.685
            I've been working   
            like crazy to-to set

06:40.720 --> 06:43.387
            something up with   
            her for almost      
            three days now.     

06:46.108 --> 06:47.291
        All right, all right.   

06:47.326 --> 06:50.361
      I'll, uh, I'll call Evan  
      and I'll try to fix it up.

06:50.395 --> 06:53.998
        I... what am... how     
        am I going to explain   
        Julie tagging along?    

06:54.033 --> 06:55.149
Oh, I don't know.               

06:55.183 --> 06:57.251
Tell him she's your sister.     

06:57.285 --> 07:02.990
    My sister? Rebecca, this is 
    a hot, gorgeous, sexy woman.

07:03.025 --> 07:04.809
                Yeah, he'll     
                believe that.   

07:09.648 --> 07:11.483
    Oh, this looks              
    just marvelous,             

07:11.517 --> 07:13.284
    Lorenzo,                    
    just marvelous.             

07:13.319 --> 07:14.886
 <i>Grazie, signore.</i>               

07:14.920 --> 07:15.753
Thanks again, Evan,             

07:15.871 --> 07:17.705
for, uh, making room            
for my sister here              

07:17.740 --> 07:19.006
on such short notice.           

07:19.040 --> 07:20.558
Yeah, I really appreciate that. 

07:21.293 --> 07:22.560
      This yacht must have      

07:22.594 --> 07:23.694
        cost a fortune!         

07:23.728 --> 07:24.913
                            SAM:
                            Mmm.

07:25.664 --> 07:27.681
         Well, did it?          

07:29.334 --> 07:31.435
Well, the important thing       
        is that it              

07:31.470 --> 07:32.603
         gets me where          
         I want to go.          

07:32.637 --> 07:34.505
                    Ah.         
                Yep.            

07:34.539 --> 07:37.675
        All I really need is    
        a boat beneath my feet  

07:37.709 --> 07:39.810
            and a star to       
            guide her with.     

07:39.845 --> 07:41.645
            And of course,      
            a helicopter pad.   

07:41.680 --> 07:43.714
    ( <i>both laugh raucously</i> )    

07:43.749 --> 07:45.400
         Oh, you have a         
         beautiful laugh, Julie.

07:45.434 --> 07:48.586
        Doesn't she brighten up 
        the old tub, Lorenzo?   

07:48.620 --> 07:51.305
  It is like a ray of sunshine  
  to have a woman as beautiful  

07:51.339 --> 07:53.707
as Miss Malone                  
onboard.                        

07:53.742 --> 07:55.026
    Oh, and of course           
        you, too.               

07:58.563 --> 07:59.430
                 Oh, yeah, yeah,
                 of course.     

07:59.465 --> 08:01.182
Oh, thank you, Mr. Drake,       
it's nice...                    

08:01.216 --> 08:03.284
          Wow, you must be very 
          proud of your brother.

08:03.318 --> 08:05.887
                He was one heck 
                of a pitcher,   
                I'll tell you.  

08:05.921 --> 08:07.371
            It's too bad he's   
            not playing now,    

08:07.405 --> 08:09.773
        when he could be        
        making some real money. 

08:09.808 --> 08:12.076
Isn't she sweet?                

08:12.911 --> 08:14.796
              You two are very  
              close, aren't you?

08:14.830 --> 08:15.730
                Mm.             
    Oh, yeah.                   

08:15.848 --> 08:18.983
She's, um, like                 
a sister to me.                 
                ( <i>laughs</i> )      

08:19.017 --> 08:20.401
                I'm afraid I    
                didn't have much

08:20.436 --> 08:22.069
                in common       
                with my brother.

08:22.103 --> 08:24.188
Oh, you, too--                  
same with my brother.           

08:24.223 --> 08:27.308
    Julie, you told me you      
    didn't have another brother.

08:27.342 --> 08:28.209
             Well...            
                    Uh, well... 

08:28.327 --> 08:30.161
                    she doesn't,
                    actually,   
                    but I do.   

08:30.196 --> 08:32.263
        Well, well, it's        
not actually his brother.       

08:32.298 --> 08:33.865
They're just such close friends 

08:33.899 --> 08:36.433
    that Sam likes to think     
    of him as his brother.      

08:36.467 --> 08:37.184
            We just don't have  

08:37.219 --> 08:40.104
            anything in         
            common, that's all. 

08:40.138 --> 08:42.306
Everything is ready, sir.       

08:42.340 --> 08:43.091
                    Ah.         
            Ah. Hey!            

08:43.208 --> 08:44.509
    Everyone help               
    themselves here.            

08:44.543 --> 08:46.344
I have to have                  
a word with the chef.           

08:46.378 --> 08:48.062
Hey, I have three for him,      
    "Keep it coming."           

08:48.097 --> 08:50.431
      ( <i>laughs</i> )                
                        Whoo!   

08:50.465 --> 08:52.150
                You know, this  
                is kind of fun, 

08:52.184 --> 08:55.186
    pretending to have this     
    whole different personality.

08:55.220 --> 08:58.056
If you like it, you might       
  want to get one of your own.  

09:00.259 --> 09:02.860
  Wow, would you look at this.  

09:02.894 --> 09:06.130
Lobster, cracked crab, caviar...

09:06.164 --> 09:07.832
Hey, ham. Whoo!                 

09:10.719 --> 09:12.453
I wonder what                   
this spread cost.               

09:12.488 --> 09:14.722
            You know, Julie, you
            seem very concerned 

09:14.757 --> 09:16.157
    with the price of things.   

09:16.191 --> 09:18.125
             Don't you find that
             a little rude?     

09:18.160 --> 09:21.646
Well, it's not like             
I asked him how old he is.      

09:21.680 --> 09:22.997
What do you think?              

09:23.032 --> 09:24.549
    45? 50?                     

09:29.939 --> 09:31.940
                 Find anything  
                 to your liking?

09:31.974 --> 09:34.509

So I guess your cabin           
is that, uh,                    

09:40.516 --> 09:42.349
really big one upstairs, huh?   

09:42.384 --> 09:43.784
                Uh-huh.         

09:43.819 --> 09:45.453
Ah, I'd really like to see it.  

09:47.022 --> 09:49.390
    Well, maybe I could take    
    you on the captain's tour   

09:49.424 --> 09:50.591
             right after dinner.

09:50.625 --> 09:52.126
Oh, I'd really like that.       

09:52.160 --> 09:54.945
             Do you think your  
             brother would mind?

What brother?                   

09:56.148 --> 09:58.583
                Ah. Great.

                      Yeah.     

10:02.454 --> 10:04.922
I can feel it in my bones.      
                    ( <i>laughs</i> )  

10:04.956 --> 10:07.925
Right after dinner,             
I'm gonna tell Evan             
how I really feel.              

10:07.959 --> 10:09.927
                     Mmm.       
No, I'm gonna                   
show him how I feel.            

10:09.961 --> 10:11.462
I'm going to seize              
the moment.                     

10:11.496 --> 10:12.697
         Fine, do what you want.

in the fifth grade.             

20:27.395 --> 20:29.213
                Excuse me, Sam. 
      ( <i>mumbles</i> )               

20:30.732 --> 20:32.499
What? Come on!                  
What are you                    
gonna do?                       

20:32.534 --> 20:33.583
You gonna go chasing            
after him?                      

20:33.618 --> 20:34.584
                    No, no, no. 
        Please.                 

20:34.619 --> 20:35.920
                    It isn't the
                    right time. 

20:35.954 --> 20:37.288
                     I just have
                     to think.  

20:38.172 --> 20:39.356
    I'm gonna go up on deck     

20:39.390 --> 20:41.158
and sleep and look at the stars.

20:41.192 --> 20:42.375
Uh, li-listen, you can't...     

20:42.410 --> 20:43.577
                      ( <i>laughs</i> )

20:43.611 --> 20:45.078
             You can't just work
             me up like that,   

20:45.112 --> 20:46.547
            and then walk out   
            of here. Please.    

20:46.581 --> 20:48.515
          Sam...                
                    No, please. 

20:48.550 --> 20:52.452
I believe you have a sister     
with a vacancy sign on her door.

20:52.487 --> 20:54.638
                Right, right.   

20:58.876 --> 21:01.378
     Say hello to the stars     
for me there, sweetheart.       

21:01.412 --> 21:03.780
 Boy, this... Okay, all right.  

21:04.599 --> 21:06.600

21:06.634 --> 21:08.351

        Um, Julie?              

21:08.386 --> 21:10.154
          ( <i>laughs</i> ):           
          Listen, uh,           

21:10.188 --> 21:12.555
    why don't we let bygones    
        be bygones here?        

21:12.590 --> 21:15.325
     Um, you were tempted,      
         I was tempted,         

21:15.359 --> 21:16.559
    but what the hell?          

21:16.594 --> 21:19.129
        We're both              
    consenting adults, huh?     

21:19.164 --> 21:21.131
    I sure hope there's, uh,    
        some room               

21:21.166 --> 21:23.167
 in that bunk of yours for me.  

21:24.269 --> 21:26.270
            There isn't.        

21:29.557 --> 21:31.758
 I got to stay off boats, man.  

21:37.165 --> 21:38.615
             Hello.             

21:38.649 --> 21:39.683
          Hey, Carla.           

21:39.717 --> 21:41.468
          Did you pick          
     your mother-in-law up?     

21:41.502 --> 21:42.636
             Yeah.              

21:42.671 --> 21:45.338
I tried to pawn her off         
on some Hare Krishnas,          

21:45.373 --> 21:46.589
          but I think           
      she's the only thing      

21:46.624 --> 21:48.525
        they won't take         
        at the airport.         

21:49.677 --> 21:51.377
    So, how's it been going?    

21:51.412 --> 21:52.329
                    Oh, fine.   

21:52.363 --> 21:55.132
        Well, they tried to pull
        that old birthday gag   

21:55.166 --> 21:57.134
            where they get a    
            free round of beers,

21:57.168 --> 21:59.153
          but I caught on       
          after the fifth round.

21:59.187 --> 22:03.006
Oh, Gomer, Gomer, Gomer.        

22:03.041 --> 22:03.824
Geez!                           

22:03.858 --> 22:05.475
                Well, lucky for 
                me, I remembered

22:05.510 --> 22:08.345
            that Mr. Clavin and 
            Mr. Peterson already
            had their birthday. 

22:08.379 --> 22:11.799
Those foam suckers              
were in on this?!               

22:11.833 --> 22:13.667
That does it.                   
Where are they?                 

22:13.701 --> 22:14.868

Hey, hey, hey.                  

22:14.903 --> 22:16.203
     I want to talk to you.     

22:16.237 --> 22:18.339
    Nobody stiffs this bar.     

22:18.373 --> 22:19.706
        Oh...                   
                    Oh...

You owe me                      

22:21.042 --> 22:23.143
        for five rounds.        

22:23.178 --> 22:25.012
Hey, come here.                 

22:25.046 --> 22:27.080
        Ooh.                    

22:28.783 --> 22:29.983
All right, Cliffie,             
we split up.                    

22:30.017 --> 22:31.685
There's no way                  
she can catch both of us.       

22:31.719 --> 22:34.020
          Norm-Norm, she's...   
          she's gonna come after
          me first, Normie.     

22:34.054 --> 22:35.322
Yeah. Ready?

                    here. Get...
