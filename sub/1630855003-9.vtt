00:35.149 --> 00:37.944

00:37.944 --> 00:40.238

- Considering her history,

05:00.039 --> 05:01.707
it probably wouldn't be
that difficult

- to have her committed again.
- That's it.

her treating physician.

- What?

18:05.866 --> 18:07.451
Hi.

18:07.451 --> 18:08.952
Well...

18:08.952 --> 18:11.246
this place seems fun.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.918
Hi.

18:16.918 --> 18:18.378
I need to talk to you.

18:18.378 --> 18:20.964
Something's happening tonight.

18:21.590 --> 18:23.925
And I need you to leave

18:23.925 --> 18:26.261
while you still can.

18:26.845 --> 18:29.097
What are you talking about?
What...?

18:29.097 --> 18:30.682
What's happening tonight?

18:30.682 --> 18:32.309
Please.

18:32.309 --> 18:33.977
Just go.

18:33.977 --> 18:34.811
Natalie...

18:34.811 --> 18:37.272
Get yourself
some regular clothes.

18:37.272 --> 18:38.732
Go have a life.

18:38.732 --> 18:42.152
You don't have to be
one of these people.

18:42.986 --> 18:46.865
Just go, okay?

18:54.247 --> 18:55.999
I appreciate

18:55.999 --> 18:58.543
you trying to teach me...

18:58.543 --> 19:02.130
forgiveness.

19:07.135 --> 19:09.805
It's a nice idea.

19:16.186 --> 19:18.188
<i>contemplative music</i>

19:32.494 --> 19:35.372
<i>sinister music</i>

20:01.732 --> 20:03.400
Coach.

20:04.735 --> 20:07.112
- Where have you been?
- Natalie.

20:07.112 --> 20:09.614
What happened?

20:10.532 --> 20:13.160
O-Okay, okay, okay, listen.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.619
I figured out

20:14.619 --> 20:16.788
where Javi was hiding,
all right?

20:16.788 --> 20:19.291
I-I think
that you and I together

20:19.291 --> 20:21.251
could probably
survive the winter.

20:22.502 --> 20:24.463
Hey, do you hear me?

20:24.463 --> 20:25.672
You don't have to stay here.

20:25.672 --> 20:28.258
You're not like
the rest of these girls.

20:28.258 --> 20:30.093
Actually, I'm worse.

20:30.093 --> 20:31.261
How can you say that?

20:31.261 --> 20:34.055
I let him die in my place.

20:37.142 --> 20:39.978
It was supposed to be me.

20:42.731 --> 20:45.734
You're a good person, Coach.

20:46.443 --> 20:50.405
You really don't belong
in this place.

20:54.659 --> 20:57.162
You should be ashamed.

20:57.162 --> 20:58.663
Well, I'm not.

20:58.663 --> 21:01.291
The fact that you can
even say that...

21:01.291 --> 21:03.794
I'm not ashamed, Travis.

21:05.504 --> 21:07.964
I'm glad I'm alive.

21:09.007 --> 21:11.092
Just like you are.

21:11.092 --> 21:12.594
And I don't think that

21:12.594 --> 21:15.972
any of us who are still here
should feel ashamed of that.

21:15.972 --> 21:18.809
Ever.

21:23.605 --> 21:25.857
Let your brother save you,

21:25.857 --> 21:28.276
Travis.

21:29.986 --> 21:33.824
After everything he went
through out here...

21:34.574 --> 21:38.453
...don't you owe him
at least that?

21:42.916 --> 21:45.710

21:45.710 --> 21:47.754

21:47.754 --> 21:51.258

on the ground</i>

21:51.258 --> 21:53.677

21:53.677 --> 21:57.305
<i>Send in the clowns</i>

22:01.726 --> 22:04.563
How did you get in here?

22:04.563 --> 22:06.523
I'm calling the police.

22:06.523 --> 22:08.108
The thing is, sir,

22:08.108 --> 22:11.152
sir, I am the police. Okay?

22:12.654 --> 22:14.489
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:14.489 --> 22:16.533
Listen, we're just here
to ask a couple of questions.

22:16.533 --> 22:18.118
I'm sorry, I'm just...

22:18.118 --> 22:20.745
You're like
an honest-to-God detective?

22:20.745 --> 22:23.164
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh,

22:23.164 --> 22:25.041
it's not really that unusual.
What-what we--

22:25.041 --> 22:27.377
You see, I'm a detective, too.
Not like you.

22:27.377 --> 22:29.629
Alas, I'm a lifelong asthmatic.

22:29.629 --> 22:31.548
But I am a citizen detective.

22:31.548 --> 22:33.592
- Have you heard of us?
- No.

22:33.592 --> 22:35.760
It's a wonderful community,
very tight-knit...

22:35.760 --> 22:37.429
Oh, my gosh.

22:37.429 --> 22:39.890
My manners.

22:45.478 --> 22:47.314
You haven't even told me yet

22:47.314 --> 22:50.317
why it is that you are here.

22:50.317 --> 22:51.610
Hot cocoa?

22:51.610 --> 22:53.278
Sure.

22:53.278 --> 22:55.322
Actually, let me guess.

22:55.322 --> 22:56.656
Shauna Sadecki.

22:56.656 --> 22:57.741
That's right.

22:57.741 --> 22:59.367
Shauna.

22:59.367 --> 23:01.411
She got here a few days ago.

23:01.411 --> 23:03.622
You know,
she's not the only one.

23:03.622 --> 23:06.207
There's practically
a coven of them.

23:06.207 --> 23:08.543
All up to no good.

23:08.543 --> 23:10.128
Hmm.

23:11.671 --> 23:13.840
You're being awfully judgy
about Mom,

23:13.840 --> 23:16.134
considering this all started
thanks to your lame attempt

23:16.134 --> 23:17.302
at blackmail.

23:17.302 --> 23:20.180
Hey, maybe those sketchy loan
people also do fake passports.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.057
The American family
is crumbling, Callie.

23:22.057 --> 23:24.976
You try making a living
in sectionals.

23:26.895 --> 23:29.981
- Dad.
- What? What?

23:31.691 --> 23:33.818
The money exchange wasn't
on the books.

23:33.818 --> 23:36.613
Shit.

23:36.613 --> 23:38.365
Go find your mother.

23:38.365 --> 23:40.825
- What? What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to take care of this.

23:40.825 --> 23:42.077
What does that mean?

23:42.077 --> 23:43.536
It means I have a plan,
Callie, so just go.

23:43.536 --> 23:46.081
- Dad.
- Callie.

23:47.207 --> 23:50.085
You need to leave this to me, okay?

23:51.127 --> 23:52.253
Go.

23:52.253 --> 23:54.214
Go, go, go, go.

23:54.214 --> 23:56.466
Go, go, go.

24:00.679 --> 24:02.764
Sorry,
th-this Jessica Roberts person,

24:02.764 --> 24:04.808
she was involved
in all this how?

24:04.808 --> 24:06.351
Mind you,
my methods aren't exactly

24:06.351 --> 24:07.978
admissible in a court of law.

24:07.978 --> 24:09.729
Oh, yeah? You'd get along
with my partner.

24:12.273 --> 24:13.608
Whoa.

24:13.608 --> 24:15.276
Jeff.

24:15.276 --> 24:17.237
You followed us here?

24:18.655 --> 24:21.533
Only 'cause you wouldn't tell us
where your wife was.

24:23.702 --> 24:24.828
You mind?

24:24.828 --> 24:27.122
Of course. Excuse me.

24:28.707 --> 24:31.251
You okay, man? 'Cause
you're looking a little...

24:31.251 --> 24:32.752
I want you,

24:32.752 --> 24:35.171
I want you to place me
under arrest.

24:35.171 --> 24:37.173
What?

24:37.173 --> 24:38.967
I did it.

24:38.967 --> 24:41.511
I killed Adam Martin.

24:41.511 --> 24:44.431
Jeff, what the fuck
are you doing?

24:44.431 --> 24:46.474
It was a crime of passion.

24:46.474 --> 24:47.726
I, uh...

24:47.726 --> 24:50.562
I-I found out that Shauna
was sleeping with him,

24:50.562 --> 24:52.105
and I went
to confront him and...

24:52.105 --> 24:54.315
and I wound up killing the guy.

24:54.941 --> 24:57.652
Jesus.

24:59.696 --> 25:03.324
I couldn't tell her.
I couldn't tell her.

25:04.576 --> 25:06.536
I did it to protect her.

25:06.536 --> 25:09.247
I did it to protect our family.

25:10.749 --> 25:11.750
Oh, shit.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.918
Kevyn? Oh, Kevyn.

25:13.918 --> 25:16.337
Kevyn. Hey, Kev.

25:16.337 --> 25:18.423
Kevyn. What the...?

25:18.423 --> 25:21.176
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck!

25:21.176 --> 25:22.886
Oh. [gasps] Shit.

25:22.886 --> 25:24.721
Hiya. Me again.

25:24.721 --> 25:27.682
- I-I didn't...
- Phenobarbital.

25:29.559 --> 25:30.518
Huh.

25:30.518 --> 25:32.353
Surprisingly fast-acting.

25:32.353 --> 25:33.605
What?

25:33.605 --> 25:36.107
Walter Tattersall,
friend of Misty's.

25:36.691 --> 25:38.401
It's okay if you haven't
heard about me yet.

25:38.401 --> 25:40.111
Jeff Sadecki, I presume.

25:40.111 --> 25:40.945
I...

25:40.945 --> 25:42.572
That was
a beautiful false confession.

25:42.572 --> 25:44.783
I could see it came
out of real love.

25:44.783 --> 25:48.036
Are you, like,
one of the cult people?

25:48.036 --> 25:50.830
Oh, no. You want to help me
move this body?

25:50.830 --> 25:52.457
What? I...

25:52.457 --> 25:53.833
Jeffrey.

25:53.833 --> 25:55.460
Does anyone call you that?

25:55.460 --> 25:56.836
Yeah, my mom.

25:56.836 --> 26:00.090
No, she... she doesn't.

26:01.591 --> 26:02.842
Hey.

26:02.842 --> 26:04.969
It's okay, buddy.

26:04.969 --> 26:06.387
I know this is a lot.

26:06.387 --> 26:09.599
But I'm a friend
and everything's gonna be fine.

26:09.599 --> 26:10.850
I just need your help now.

26:10.850 --> 26:13.520
So grab those legs for me.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.146
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

26:15.146 --> 26:16.564
Okay.

Okay. One, two, a-three.

I thought it wanted

- Yeah, I'm with the daughter.

they'll discover

45:09.321 --> 45:12.407
I never wanted to be in charge.

45:17.037 --> 45:20.457

45:22.376 --> 45:25.545
...because I was the only one
who knew how to listen.

45:29.341 --> 45:32.219
But I can't hear it anymore.

45:34.346 --> 45:37.891
I think that's because
it doesn't need me anymore.

45:41.103 --> 45:43.730
You all learned how to hear it.

of the time we're out here.
