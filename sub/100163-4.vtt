We just made
that bank our bitch!

00:35.234 --> 00:37.570
Dude! That was
a Noguchi coffee table.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.805
Uh, sorry. But hey!

Now you can buy
a bunch of 'em!

just hand me some money.

[annoyed sigh] I'm gonna go
make some nettles tea.

00:48.247 --> 00:50.616
Oh, man. This was
our best heist yet.

00:50.616 --> 00:52.304
And we hit the perfect tone!

00:52.304 --> 00:54.286
Like, okay,
everyone in the bank
was super scared of us,

00:54.387 --> 00:57.289
but like not so much that
they weren't also delighted

00:57.289 --> 00:58.725
when I just cartwheeled out.

I'm sure everybody on the news
is talkin' about it.

I hope we didn't miss
too much of the coverage.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.335
Credit union?
That's just a poor person bank.

We robbed a real one

01:11.304 --> 01:14.707

predatory lending practices!

01:14.808 --> 01:16.409
No, the news

-[Poison Ivy] No.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.200
No "or". I just
gave you great advice.

But, there's only one thing
stopping us from

02:00.387 --> 02:02.623
No one's <i>trying</i> to stop us.

Of course!

02:03.656 --> 02:05.424
Joker has Batman

02:05.525 --> 02:07.359
and suddenly a simple crime

02:07.460 --> 02:10.362
becomes a thrilling narrative

02:10.463 --> 02:12.832
Exactly. We need a nemesis!

Lex Luthor has Superman.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.250
What was your headline?

08:47.250 --> 08:50.029
It's <i>Harley Quinn,</i>
<i>number one supervillain</i>
<i>in the many multiverses,</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:51.730

<i>to a nemesis,</i>

08:51.730 --> 08:53.232
<i>much less Robin the Boy Wonder,</i>

08:53.234 --> 08:56.102
<i>or any nemesis</i>
<i>that's boy or bird based.</i>

08:56.102 --> 08:58.004
Ya can punch it up if ya want.
You're the writer.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.240
[laugh] Thanks. No.

09:00.341 --> 09:02.109
Okay, then I'm gonna
have to kill ya.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.210
Okay, go ahead.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.914
[spits and coughs]

09:06.914 --> 09:09.383
I need to remember
to keep my mouth closed
when I bust through walls.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.884
-I've been tellin' ya that.
-Holy shit! It's Supes!

09:11.985 --> 09:13.120
King Shark, get the camera.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.620
Livestream me
fightin' Superman.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.956
My new nemesis.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.291
Okay, you're live.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.058
[Harley] Hey, Superman!

09:19.058 --> 09:21.827
Come get Lois Lame
before I make <i>her</i> a deadline!

09:21.927 --> 09:23.364
[stammers]
That made sense, right?

09:23.464 --> 09:25.131
Is she mad about
the paywall too?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.701
Seven nintey-nine <i>is</i>
an ambitious price point.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.669
And it doesn't include
the crossword, which is ridic.

09:30.769 --> 09:31.971
Ya gonna fight me or what?

09:32.072 --> 09:35.075
[chuckles] Everybody duck.

09:35.174 --> 09:39.111
You were ill-advised to think
you could get away from me,
Harley Quinn.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.215
-[Lois] Aww!
-[groans] Oh god!

09:41.215 --> 09:42.349
Again?

09:42.349 --> 09:43.682
[chuckles] Hey, sport.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.818
I fail to find
the humor in this.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.287
No need to
be nervous, kiddo.

09:47.388 --> 09:49.222
Just step into the box.
You got this!

09:49.322 --> 09:52.091
You're embarrassing me
in front of my nemesis.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.027
Actually I'm not currently
committed to anyone,

09:54.126 --> 09:55.861
but y'know, Supes,
if you're avail, I'm...

09:55.861 --> 09:57.831
Flattered, but I have
a pretty full dance card.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.365
Leave us be, boy scout.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.868
I'm sure there's
a cat up a tree somewhere.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.202
A cat up a tree.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.172
Isn't this just
the cutest thing ever?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.206
Lois, you okay
if the little guy
takes it from here?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.942
Yeah, whatever.
We still doing sushi tonight?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.110
You know how I... roll.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.946
[both groan]

10:12.946 --> 10:15.816
Do me a favor.
Can you untag me
from this whole thing?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.650
You ready to do battle, Quinn?

10:17.650 --> 10:19.119
[sigh] Let's go.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.153
[Robin] That's right.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.855
Run away! Fear me!

10:22.956 --> 10:26.994
[groans] That was the
most humiliatin' t-- [gasps]

10:27.094 --> 10:30.062
Oh my god, Ivy!
You're pregnant? Oh!

10:30.062 --> 10:31.965
This is gonna be
so bad for your career,

10:32.065 --> 10:33.899
but so good for your Instagram.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.403
No. All this shit is for you.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.837
Aww. No baby?

10:37.837 --> 10:38.938
Nope. No baby.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.072
But there is a card.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.707
And it was addressed to you,

10:41.707 --> 10:45.178
so I didn't open it because
I'm not a rude person.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.782
[Joker from card]
<i>Congrats on Robin the cradle.</i>

10:48.881 --> 10:51.384

10:59.389 --> 11:03.129
[sarcastically] Well,
this room was missing
a dusting of ash everywhere.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.465
All right, that's it.
Enough of this shit.

11:04.465 --> 11:05.465
We're killin' Robin.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.768
Harley, you can't kill him.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.336
You don't think I can
kill a 12-year-old?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.336
Oh, okay.

11:11.336 --> 11:12.687
Well, I will smash in his face

11:12.687 --> 11:15.274
[shouts] with a bat
like a watermelon!

11:15.375 --> 11:18.479
Oh, no, no.
I believe you have
the ability to kill him.

11:18.479 --> 11:20.113
What I'm saying is,

11:20.114 --> 11:22.048
if you do it, you validate
what everyone's saying.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.115
That Robin's your nemesis.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.951
Also, you'd be a child killer,

11:25.052 --> 11:26.952
which some may argue is worse.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.120
Unless...

11:28.120 --> 11:30.023
Ah, you've got that "or" face.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.725
Just... Can you make
your eyebrows normal?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.192
-I've...
-Yes?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.692
No no, I wasn't
sayin' your name.

11:34.692 --> 11:37.197
I was sayin' "I've"
as in I've got a plan.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.365
[Dr. Psycho] Listen shark-man,
get in the tank.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.268
All you gotta do is swim around

11:41.368 --> 11:43.937
and scare the kid so bad
he admits he's lying.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.037
Oh, I-I'm not
that kind of shark.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.075
I'm more of
the tech savvy kind.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.174
It's fine.

11:49.174 --> 11:51.077
I can play
the role of shark
if he won't.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.346

11:58.384 --> 12:02.288
Fear my rows of teeth,
my unpredictable nature.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.625
Yeah, that's offensive
in a number of ways.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.461
I-I'll just be the shark.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.129
But, just to
double check here.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.398
I-I'm not gonna
do any biting, right?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.832
'Cause I do not
do well around blood.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.201
No blood.

to scare him.

to be my nemesis.

Unhand me, you freak.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.256

the truth about us.

ever tell the truth?

any time I wanted,

and kids are gross.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.692
[chuckles] <i>Joker seems</i>
<i>to claim you as his nemesis.</i>

17:39.792 --> 17:41.828
<i>But you came here</i>
<i>to fight, Harley.</i>

17:41.828 --> 17:43.497
<i>And now...</i> [laughs]

17:43.596 --> 17:45.732
<i>...you're fighting Ivy.</i>
<i>Which one is it?</i>

17:45.833 --> 17:48.101
<i>Me! I'm his, he's mine.</i>

17:48.201 --> 17:49.702
<i>I mean, we're together. Ha!</i>

17:49.803 --> 17:50.804
[shouts] Oh!

17:50.904 --> 17:53.405
[audience] Tawny! Tawny! Tawny!

17:53.406 --> 17:56.542
[chanting continues on screen]

17:56.643 --> 17:58.178
[man cheering]
I love you, Tawny!

17:58.278 --> 18:00.528
[all grunting]

18:03.549 --> 18:04.549
[beeping]

18:06.720 --> 18:07.820
[all gasp]

18:07.922 --> 18:08.922
[Harley growls angrily]

18:11.324 --> 18:13.574
[Joker laughs]

18:17.497 --> 18:18.498
Dad!

18:18.598 --> 18:20.267
[audience screaming]

18:20.366 --> 18:21.769
[Joker laughs]

18:23.670 --> 18:25.571
[disco music playing]

18:25.672 --> 18:26.906
[screaming continues]

18:27.907 --> 18:28.907
[beeping]

18:30.305 --> 18:31.305
Robin!

18:31.305 --> 18:33.881
If you want to see
the Boy Wonder alive again,

18:33.980 --> 18:37.483
you better start showing up
to <i>my</i> cool crimes.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.520
[audience screaming]

18:41.622 --> 18:44.290
Oh! What a show,
folks! [laughs]

18:44.391 --> 18:47.294
-Well, I am spent.
-[audience cheering
and clapping]

18:47.394 --> 18:48.862
Well stay tuned 'cause up next,

18:48.962 --> 18:51.330
we're bringing out
those rescued ferrets.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.865
[squeals] Ooh!
I wanna squeeze one!

18:52.967 --> 18:54.534
Nope. Come on. We're leaving.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.306
[Poison Ivy sighs] Well,
that was a shit show.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.093
Yeah! But, it was a fun show.

19:01.093 --> 19:03.777
-Except for Batman
kickin' my ass on live TV.
-[Harley grunts on TV]

19:03.876 --> 19:05.645
At least you got
a swag bag, right?

19:05.746 --> 19:07.847
Ooh! Look at this.
Organic shampoo.

19:07.948 --> 19:10.383
Ugh! It says for
fine to normal hair. Damn it.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.785
I can't believe after all this,

19:11.884 --> 19:13.486
I still don't have a nemesis.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.221
You know what?
You can't force it.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.490
-I mean, there's someone
out there just for you.
-[sighs]

19:17.490 --> 19:19.893
Do the crimes
that make you happy
and the rest will come.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.929
JKH, right? Just keep heisting.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.696
JK's already a thing.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.731
You add an 'H' to it,
and I don't know what that is.

19:25.731 --> 19:26.866
It's muddled.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.060
Yeah, I'm not here
to workshop this.

19:28.060 --> 19:29.736
Thanks for always
givin' me great advice, Ive.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.304
Even if I don't always use it.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.571
You actually never use it.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.508
But I love
never usin' your advice

19:34.508 --> 19:36.977
more than
anyone else's advice
I never use.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.878
Also, listen, I am very sorry

19:38.878 --> 19:40.980
for the way me and my crew
have been treating' your place.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.782
That changes today.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.652
Yes. We promise
to keep your apartment
much cleaner.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.220
Wait, why is <i>he</i> cleaning?

19:47.220 --> 19:49.690
Did you add that
giant shark to your crew?

19:49.690 --> 19:51.892
Actually, I'm a
normal-sized shark,

19:51.991 --> 19:54.326
but I suppose
I am large for a man.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.229
And yes, I'm in the crew.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.665
It's just nice to be
on a schedule. [laughs]

19:59.666 --> 20:01.500
Yeah, you saw what he can do
when he flips out.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.803
I mean, how am I
gonna say no to that?

20:02.803 --> 20:04.738
Plus, he does computer good.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.606
That's it, you're outta here!

20:07.607 --> 20:09.609
This is a
formal eviction notice!

20:09.710 --> 20:12.278
You're evicting me?
On what grounds?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.615
Your lease says no pets!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.583
-Him!
-Well, that's racist!

20:16.682 --> 20:18.751
O-or at the
very least xenophobic.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.751
Xena who?

20:19.751 --> 20:22.021
The bikini broad with
a sword as big as she is?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.226
I love her!

20:23.226 --> 20:25.258
But that shark's been
coming in here all week.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.287
Please, Sy.

20:26.287 --> 20:27.760
I love this apartment
more than anything.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.362
I-I'll kick them out.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.529
I'll kick all of them out.

20:30.529 --> 20:32.833
Too late!
You're evicted, honey.

20:32.932 --> 20:36.435
Hey! At least you don't
have to keep cleaning up
after us any more, right?

20:36.435 --> 20:38.080
[stammers] 'Cause you know,
let's be honest.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.740
-It was really
only gonna get worse.
-[Ivy growls]

20:39.839 --> 20:41.340
-[loud thud]
-[glass cracking]

20:43.076 --> 20:45.679
[sighs] We can split that one.

20:45.679 --> 20:46.679
Sounds fair.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.315
[somber music playing]

20:50.483 --> 20:52.885
Damian, I made your favorite.

20:52.987 --> 20:55.655
You didn't make that.
Alfred made that.

20:55.756 --> 21:00.094
I made him make it.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.496
Are you mad because
I had to save you from Joker?

21:02.596 --> 21:04.396
No. I'm livid because

21:04.397 --> 21:07.567
everyone in Teen Titans
is getting a nemesis,
except me.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.336
[sigh] I'm gonna say
something embarrassing here.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.539
I didn't have
a nemesis until

21:13.640 --> 21:14.641
my late 20s.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.308
Don't patronize me, Father.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.344
It's unbecoming.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.411
It's true.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.813
I wasn't ready for one.

21:19.913 --> 21:21.949
You want your first nemesis
to be special.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.416
Someone who you could see
being your nemesis

21:24.416 --> 21:25.885
for the rest of your life.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.887
I suppose you're right, Father.

21:27.988 --> 21:29.957
When can I start having sex?

21:30.057 --> 21:31.590
I think I hear the Bat Signal.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.426
