00:01.041 --> 00:03.291
(J.D.) <i>It's been a long road,</i>
<i>but over the past 2 months,</i>

00:03.375 --> 00:05.250
<i>Elliot and I have totally</i>
<i>rebuilt our friendship.</i>

00:05.333 --> 00:08.250
Incoming.

00:08.333 --> 00:10.625
Good morning. Ha, ha.

00:10.709 --> 00:13.333
Uhh!

00:13.417 --> 00:16.125
Co-chiefy,
got you a little somethin' somethin'.

00:16.208 --> 00:20.291
Thank you. And I actually
got you a little something.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.375
A magnifying glass?

00:26.458 --> 00:29.125
Yes, for these.

00:29.208 --> 00:33.250
(gasps) You got the tiny post-its!
Oh, awesome!

00:33.333 --> 00:36.458
For our tiny bulletin board.

00:36.542 --> 00:38.834
And I have a dentist appointment

00:38.917 --> 00:42.000
that got moved to Tuesday at 4 P.M.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.917
"Don't floss before you come in.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.333
It makes your gums bloody."
Ohh!

00:47.417 --> 00:49.417
(J.D.)
<i>Bottom line, together, Elliot and I</i>

00:49.500 --> 00:51.542
<i>are the greatest co-chief</i>
<i>residents of all time.</i>

00:51.625 --> 00:53.917
You two are, without a doubt,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.542
the worst co-chief
residents of all time.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.083
In case you haven't noticed,

00:58.166 --> 01:01.750
we've got ourselves one hospital
chockfull of monkey interns,

01:01.834 --> 01:03.417
and news flash,

01:03.500 --> 01:06.125
your job is to catch
whatever they're flinging.

01:06.208 --> 01:10.166
Coffee talk, ladies,
is now officially over!

01:10.250 --> 01:12.750
Get your asses to work. Now.

01:14.709 --> 01:18.041
-Cream?
-Please.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.875
(J.D.) <i>Yup, not even</i>
<i>Dr. Cox could faze us,</i>

01:19.959 --> 01:22.542
<i>because we had every facet</i>
<i>of this job down.</i>

01:22.625 --> 01:25.125
<i>We figured out a fair way</i>
<i>to schedule all the interns' shifts.</i>

01:25.208 --> 01:28.750
Ok, whoever gets Dr. Reid's
scrub top back to her first

01:28.834 --> 01:30.709
doesn't have to work this weekend.

01:30.792 --> 01:32.000
Commence the scuffle.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.000
-Hmm. Hope it doesn't rain today.
-Me too.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.875
(shouting)

01:37.959 --> 01:40.083
(J.D.) <i>We knew how to protect</i>
<i>the interns from Dr. Kelso.</i>

01:40.166 --> 01:42.166
Look, Brent, is it?

01:42.250 --> 01:45.291
Son, please tell me you come with
a money back guarantee,

01:45.375 --> 01:47.667
because I'd like to get
something useful

01:47.750 --> 01:50.250
like a can of Brent remover.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.291
-I mean, for God's--
-Sake, Brent!

01:53.375 --> 01:55.000
When are you gonna wake up
and use that--

01:55.083 --> 01:57.917
Rock that you have been
calling your skull?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.166
We got this, sir.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.583
I mean, even a blind squirrel
occasionally finds a nut--

02:01.667 --> 02:03.291
He's gone. He's gone.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.291
Look, Brent, you are doing fine...

02:05.375 --> 02:09.583
(J.D.) <i>Still, it's not like we didn't</i>
<i>keep the interns on their toes.</i>

02:09.667 --> 02:11.291
So, Lonnie, get in here
and see the effects

02:11.375 --> 02:13.542
of cirrhosis of the liver.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.166
-Aah!
-Aah!

02:15.250 --> 02:17.500
J.D., you knew I was gonna do that.

02:17.583 --> 02:20.709
But it was still very startling.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.166
Here's your shirt, Dr. Reid.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.750
Wow, Daisy. Enjoy your weekend,
you little scrapper.

02:26.834 --> 02:30.208
Now, Daisy, I'm supposed to ask you,
can Lonnie have his lower lip back?

02:30.291 --> 02:31.667
It's my trophy.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.750
-Ah.
-Ah.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.500
Hey, this guy's coding.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.750
(J.D.)<i> Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>I can handle a code,</i>

02:38.834 --> 02:40.291
<i>but every so often,</i>
<i>every single thing</i>

02:40.375 --> 02:43.083
<i>that can conceivably go wrong</i>
<i>with a patient goes wrong at once.</i>

02:43.166 --> 02:44.875
-He's in V.F.
-We've lost an airway.

02:44.959 --> 02:45.834
He's blown a pupil.

02:45.917 --> 02:47.417
Ok, just give me a second,
all right?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.542
(J.D.)<i> I call these train wreck</i>
<i>codes, and they're not my forte.</i>

02:50.625 --> 02:52.667
<i>Luckily,</i>
<i>that's when Elliot is at her best.</i>

02:52.750 --> 02:55.000
J.D., I've got your back.
Laverne, bolus with amiodarone.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.291
Get me the crash cart.
Grab me a central line kit. I'll bag him.

02:57.375 --> 02:58.583
Run the fluids wide open.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.166
(J.D.)
<i>I honestly didn't understand</i>

03:00.250 --> 03:02.542
<i>how she could do</i>
<i>so many things at once.</i>

03:06.291 --> 03:10.834
Fourteen across. Four letters.
Band that sang Roseanna.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.166
Toto!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.792
T-O-T-O. Toto.

03:17.875 --> 03:21.000
Ok. He's stable.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.000
(J.D.) <i>See, my problem is</i>

03:22.083 --> 03:23.750
<i>that I've just never been much</i>
<i>of a multitasker.</i>

03:23.834 --> 03:25.792
<i>For instance,</i>
<i>I can't eat and watch TV</i>

03:25.875 --> 03:28.208
<i>or drive my scooter</i>
<i>and answer my phone.</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:30.333
-(ring)
-Hello?

03:30.417 --> 03:32.000
The throttle's stuck!

03:33.583 --> 03:35.959
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Look out! Look out!

03:36.041 --> 03:37.625
Look out! Look out...

03:37.709 --> 03:39.667
(J.D.)
<i>Ha! Scared Lonnie again.</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:41.208
(aloud) Whoa! Whoa!
Throttle! Throttle!

03:41.291 --> 03:42.792
Throttle's stuck!
Throttle's stuck!

03:42.875 --> 03:43.750
(J.D.)<i> Tater-tots.</i>
Whoa!

03:43.834 --> 03:46.375
Over here.
You can get back outside.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.750
Whoa!

03:55.000 --> 03:58.250
Whoever this is, you are not gonna
believe what just happened to me.

03:58.333 --> 04:01.125
I believe it.
It was cool.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.166
Janitor.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.000
Ambrosia.

04:07.417 --> 04:12.250
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own</i>
<i>no, I know ♪</i>

04:12.333 --> 04:14.458
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:17.875 --> 04:19.500
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:23.208 --> 04:26.250
-Thank you, Janitor.
-Mm-hmm.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.041
Classic Janitor.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.625
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.709
You know, that guy that
crashed this morning is doing great.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.500
(Dr. Cox) Oh, Barbie.

04:36.583 --> 04:39.333
Maybe you can take a break
from congratulating yourself

04:39.417 --> 04:41.667
and figure out what's wrong
with Ms. Kasuba over there,

04:41.750 --> 04:43.458
seeing as you're her doctor

04:43.542 --> 04:46.083
and she's been in the I.C.U.
for three days.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.709
We're, um, running lots of tests.

04:48.792 --> 04:51.333
Tests? Oh, ho, ho! Goodie!

04:51.417 --> 04:53.583
And what exactly
will you be looking for?

04:53.667 --> 04:55.125
And if it's the slowest doctor
in the hospital,

04:55.208 --> 04:57.834
then, ding, ding, ding, ding--

04:57.917 --> 05:00.083
I already found her.
Figure it out.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.750
(J.D.) <i>See, this is why</i>
<i>it doesn't bother me</i>

05:01.834 --> 05:04.375
<i>that Elliot is so much better</i>
<i>with the train wreck codes.</i>

05:04.458 --> 05:08.125
<i>Her biggest weakness</i>
<i>is my biggest strength, diagnosis.</i>

05:08.208 --> 05:11.875
Elliot, if you need help,
just ask Dr. Diagnosis.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.667
You could be my sidekick,
Bangs McCoy.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.208
(J.D.)
<i>Lately it seemed like Turk</i>

05:18.291 --> 05:20.333
<i>was being a little casual</i>
<i>about his diabetes.</i>

05:20.417 --> 05:21.583
Okay, you all know the rules.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.834
I test my blood sugar,
you bet high or low,

05:23.917 --> 05:25.542
and 25% goes to diabetes.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.291
Because if we all work hard,

05:27.375 --> 05:30.500
together, I can get
a big ass flat screen.

05:30.583 --> 05:33.417
-That's right, baby.
-I want high.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.959
Low and slow,
that's his tempo.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.500
This game is sick.
High.

05:38.542 --> 05:39.917
194.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.041
-Yes!
-Ahh!

05:41.125 --> 05:43.333
-Give me some, Laverne.
-It's that high, baby?

05:43.417 --> 05:45.291
You've been sneaking
brownies, haven't you?

05:45.375 --> 05:47.458
Well, don't think
that when you go blind

05:47.542 --> 05:49.375
I'm gonna go get you
no seeing eye dog.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.208
I'm gonna name him Gizmo.

05:51.291 --> 05:52.667
That's what we were
gonna name our robot.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.500
When we get the robot,
we'll just name him Tupac.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.333
"Tupac, may I please
have some waffles?"

05:57.417 --> 05:59.083
(imitating robot)
"Would you like some syrup?"

05:59.166 --> 06:01.917
Yeah, that'll be fine. It'll work.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.125
Maybe Ms. Kasuba has
a perinephric abscess.

06:09.208 --> 06:11.333
Nah, her pain is central,
not near the back.

06:11.417 --> 06:12.792
Come on, Bangs.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.917
You know what helps me
when I'm diagnosing?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.125
Mentally picturing everything.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.458
Like those sugar packets there.

06:19.542 --> 06:21.250
How do you think they got there?

06:24.500 --> 06:27.458
(Elliot)<i> Somebody probably</i>
<i>knocked them over.</i>

06:28.667 --> 06:32.083
I don't think so. You see,
the packets are neatly stacked.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.959
Plus, that coffee cup has a lipstick

06:34.041 --> 06:37.083
of a certain very hot
Nurse Tisdale.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.000
Ooh.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.333
If you're looking for sugar,
there's some on the floor.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.250
<i>♪ Thong ♪</i>

06:48.333 --> 06:51.792
It's the classic
Todd thong sugar trap.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.041
Wow.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.667
Now let's apply the same thing
to Mrs. Kasuba.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.542
We know this isn't the first time
she's experienced abdominal pain.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.500
What else do we know about her?

07:00.583 --> 07:04.083
You know what, J.D.?
I've got to run. Are you ok here?

07:04.166 --> 07:05.709
Yeah. I got this.

07:07.583 --> 07:12.625
Say, that was some real Nancy
Drew stuff there. Nancy.

07:12.709 --> 07:15.208
I mean, absolutely irrelevant
as far as medicine goes,

07:15.291 --> 07:16.792
but damn amusing.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.250
Don't feel weird because
you're threatened by my gift.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.458
Many are.

07:20.542 --> 07:23.792
Did you feel that
you weren't quite annoying enough

07:23.875 --> 07:26.166
without adding
a delusional sense of grandeur?

07:26.250 --> 07:29.500
Because I promise you,
you are annoying enough.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.709
In fact,
you're the number one contender

07:31.792 --> 07:33.625
for the middle weight
annoyance crown.

07:33.709 --> 07:35.417
Well,
you're the number one jealous...

07:35.500 --> 07:39.083
Weight for the jealous,
weight jealous champ.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.792
He's done it!
He's done it!

07:41.875 --> 07:46.959
Dorian's the most annoying man
in the world!

07:47.041 --> 07:51.041
Who would have ever thought,
a journeyman annoyer like Dorian?

07:51.125 --> 07:53.667
You were a close second.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.166
I have a couple of announcements.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.208
There's a serious problem
around here

07:57.291 --> 07:59.041
with not getting to know
our patients.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.458
Yes, the doctor told you
to administer Haldol,

08:01.542 --> 08:03.000
but why is he prescribing it?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.875
Does the patient
have a chance of sun downing

08:04.959 --> 08:07.375
or is he prone to psychotic breaks
and needs to be tied down?

08:07.458 --> 08:09.625
You have to ask these questions,
right, Tammy?

08:10.208 --> 08:12.333
Child, we are swamped.

08:12.417 --> 08:14.125
When do you think
we're gonna get that kind of time?

08:14.208 --> 08:17.208
Laverne, if you care,
you'll go the extra mile,

08:17.291 --> 08:19.500
-like my husband. Turk?
-Hmm?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.083
You have three patients
on the floor.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.250
What can you tell us about them?

08:22.333 --> 08:25.000
Well, I'm cutting out
that guy's appendix,

08:25.083 --> 08:27.000
I'm sewing up her lacerated spleen,

08:27.083 --> 08:28.709
and I'm slicing off that dude's foot.

08:28.792 --> 08:31.166
Great. And why are you
doing those things?

08:31.250 --> 08:33.875
Because it says so on the charts.

08:34.792 --> 08:36.583
What'd I do?

08:38.166 --> 08:40.375
J.D., you up for some coffee?

08:40.458 --> 08:43.458
I can't. I've almost got
Mrs. Kasuba's condition figured out.

08:43.542 --> 08:45.667
Hey, I'll join you
for a cup of mud.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.083
Great! Meet me downstairs
in five minutes.

08:48.166 --> 08:51.583
I'll be there. Just let me wash
this glue off my hands.

08:53.333 --> 08:58.250
What was he glueing?
Not again.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.709
I can't believe you're going
on a date with the Janitor.

09:03.792 --> 09:06.375
J.D., it's just coffee.
It's not a date.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.625
-Milady.
-I have to go.

09:17.458 --> 09:20.041
Baby, don't be mad.
You know about surgeons.

09:20.125 --> 09:22.583
We're hammers and
our patients are nails,

09:22.667 --> 09:24.417
and hammers don't
get to know nails.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.625
They hammer them. Why?
Because hammers.

09:27.709 --> 09:30.291
For the last time, Turk, I'm not
gonna call you "the hammer."

09:30.375 --> 09:32.125
Look, I was trying to make
a point to my nurses

09:32.208 --> 09:33.500
and I needed you to back me up.

09:33.583 --> 09:36.000
I know, but none of the other hammers
get to know their patients.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.166
Yeah, well, none of them get to do

09:37.250 --> 09:40.125
what you did to me last night, either.

09:41.333 --> 09:44.500
Come on, Papi.
Give it to me.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.166
(record needle scratches)

09:46.250 --> 09:48.208
See? When I clap my hands
at the same time,

09:48.291 --> 09:49.250
it looks totally real.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.333
I know!
Let's go freak out J.D.!

09:51.417 --> 09:52.917

09:53.000 --> 09:57.750
Ok. Fine, I'll try.
One condition.

09:57.834 --> 10:00.417
-Give me some.
-Aah!

10:00.500 --> 10:02.083
(Ted) Oh, my God!

10:02.166 --> 10:06.000
I think it, and she does it.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.667
Acute intermittent porphyria!
I figured it out!

10:08.750 --> 10:11.125
All right,
who's got Dr. Cox's pager number?

10:12.542 --> 10:15.291
Oh, who am I kidding?
I got my Perry's pager song.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.709
<i>♪ Dr. Cox</i>
<i>And my dog pages 324 ♪</i>

10:17.792 --> 10:19.333

I'm gonna need you to get

Mrs. Kasuba started

10:22.125 --> 10:25.125
-Dr. Reid already ordered that.
-She what?

10:27.792 --> 10:31.375
Um, you know what, J.D.?
I've got to run. Are you ok here?

10:31.959 --> 10:34.333
She figured it out before me.

10:34.417 --> 10:37.458
(J.D.) <i>There are a lot of things</i>

10:40.625 --> 10:42.333
All right, now, before we start,

10:42.417 --> 10:45.291
just in case my wife asks,
and she probably will,

10:45.375 --> 10:48.208
what did this guy do
to get his foot cut off?

10:48.291 --> 10:49.583
(J.D.) <i>Whether it's catching</i>

10:49.667 --> 10:50.917

<i>Or realizing you've just done</i>

10:59.250 --> 11:00.667
<i>the most embarrassing thing</i>

11:00.750 --> 11:06.875
Stupid Janitor. Stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.875
<i>But even that's not as bad</i>
<i>as it can get.</i>

11:08.959 --> 11:10.250
Why didn't you tell me?

11:10.333 --> 11:12.917
I just thought that after I bailed
you out of that train wreck code

11:13.000 --> 11:14.792
that you could,
you know, use a win.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.333
Great diagnosis there, Barbie.

11:16.417 --> 11:18.667
Wasn't me.
J.D. figured it out.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.458
Well, then, nice job, Nancy.

11:22.542 --> 11:25.917
(J.D.) <i>The worst thing is realizing</i>

<i>That's why I knew</i>
<i>it'd be better for me</i>

11:34.125 --> 11:35.750

11:37.333 --> 11:40.041
Elliot diagnosed
Mrs. Kasuba, not me.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.625
I know. And your
guilty anguish is,

11:42.709 --> 11:44.542
mmm, mmm, mmm, delicious.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.875
It's like a little mini meal
between lunch and dinner.

11:46.959 --> 11:50.000
Quite frankly, it's all I can do
not to grind pepper on your head.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.834
I don't get it. When did she become
a better doctor than me?

11:52.917 --> 11:55.875
Probably during one of those
countless times you were goofing off.

11:55.959 --> 12:00.625
Hey, as soon as I step foot
in this hospital, I'm all business.

12:01.542 --> 12:03.792
Good morning, Dr. Cox,

12:03.875 --> 12:08.333
from the world's
most giant doctor.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.667
Well, that was outside
the hospital.

12:10.750 --> 12:11.959
Plus, Elliot was the legs.

12:12.041 --> 12:15.375
Sure, she's skinny,
but she's thick through the trunk.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.583
If you could just help me
with these train wreck codes.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.166
You're finally at that stage

12:19.250 --> 12:21.250
where you and your equally
undistinguished colleagues

12:21.333 --> 12:24.250
have all had enough training
to be able to help each other.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.458
So no matter
how humiliating it may seem,

12:26.542 --> 12:28.750
if you know somebody
who's better than you,

12:28.834 --> 12:31.208
and I'm bettin' that you do,

12:31.291 --> 12:33.750
you had best tuck that
ridiculously feminine tail of yours

12:33.834 --> 12:36.750
between your legs and
go ask her for help.

12:36.834 --> 12:41.083
I'm thinking that's just about it.
Yup. I, uh...

12:41.166 --> 12:42.542
Gosh, I'm all out of speeches.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.625
I don't think I have
another one on me.

12:44.709 --> 12:46.333
I don't.

13:37.583 --> 13:40.333
This whole blonde doctor
situation has me mortified.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.750
I gathered the brain trust here

13:42.834 --> 13:45.333
to help me figure out
a way out of this.

13:45.417 --> 13:48.083
Uh-oh, bro.
There she is.

that's poking.

13:51.792 --> 13:52.667

13:52.750 --> 13:55.125
Here's a chance to learn
a lesson as a group, ok?

13:55.208 --> 13:56.583
Sometimes you just gotta
face the music

13:56.667 --> 13:58.125

I was wearing a suit at all

14:12.208 --> 14:16.458
was because our, uh...

maybe you can tell me why you're
being such an unbelievable jerk.

sneaking cookies,
and hiding from it,

16:03.458 --> 16:07.250
all because I'm scared
to ask myself the questions.
