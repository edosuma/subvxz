KIEFER SUTHERLAND:
Previously on Family Guy.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.432
Maybe this summer
he should take swim lessons.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.059
Would you like that, Stewie?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.648
(SCREAMING)

00:24.024 --> 00:25.025
(GASPS)

00:27.027 --> 00:28.987
I'm alive. I'm alive!

00:29.071 --> 00:30.239
Who the hell was that?

00:30.322 --> 00:32.157
Well, given
the wonderful shoe shopping,

00:32.241 --> 00:33.909
I would cast my
vote for "Heaven."

00:36.245 --> 00:38.288
Oh, Daddy,
I knew I'd find you.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.083
I'm not your father.
I'm you.

00:47.798 --> 00:51.093
It seems today
that all you see

00:51.176 --> 00:54.388
Is violence in
movies and sex on TV

00:54.471 --> 00:58.100
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:58.183 --> 01:01.019
On which we used to rely?

01:01.103 --> 01:04.398
Lucky there's a family guy

01:04.481 --> 01:07.818
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

01:07.901 --> 01:09.403
All the things
that make us

01:09.486 --> 01:11.113
Laugh and cry

01:11.196 --> 01:16.076
He's a family guy

01:20.706 --> 01:22.875
You're me from the future?
That's absurd.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.418
I'm afraid it's true, Stewie.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.211
I'm the man you
dreamed you'd be

01:26.295 --> 01:27.838
when you were alone in your bedroom
planning world domination

01:27.921 --> 01:30.132
and singing Donna Summer
into your hairbrush.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.759
Tell him to just get out

01:32.843 --> 01:35.345
Nothing left to talk about

01:35.429 --> 01:38.223
Pack his raincoat,
show him out

01:38.307 --> 01:41.977
Just look him in
the eyes and simply shout

01:42.060 --> 01:44.062
Enough is enough is enough
Enough is enough is enough

01:44.146 --> 01:45.480
I can't go on
I can't go on

01:45.564 --> 01:48.150
I can't go on no more, no
I can't go on no more, no

01:48.233 --> 01:50.110
Enough is enough is enough
Enough is enough is enough

01:50.194 --> 01:51.612
I want him out
I want him out

01:51.695 --> 01:55.157
BOTH:
I want him out that door now

01:55.240 --> 01:56.575
It is you... Me!

01:56.658 --> 01:58.785
Oh, God,
I have so many questions about the future.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.162
Is all food in pill form?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.663
Do they have flying cars?

02:01.747 --> 02:04.249
Did they ever find
a successful vehicle for Ellen Cleghorne?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.626
I can't answer
those questions.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.336
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.505
It's a violation
of the terms of my vacation.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.589
Vacation?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.090
Yes, you see,
in the future,

02:12.174 --> 02:15.135
people take vacations not to destinations,
but to periods of time.

02:15.219 --> 02:18.138
In fact, just last summer
I went back to visit Jesus Christ.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.516
Turns out his abilities
might have been exaggerated a bit.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.686
(SINGING EXCITING MELODY)

02:42.287 --> 02:43.455
Look, I've already
said enough.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.748
I really should
be getting back.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.667
You can't just leave me.
I must know my future.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.293
Sorry,
it's against the rules.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.878
Goodbye, Stewie.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.172
Surprise!

02:54.633 --> 02:55.717
Oh, this is just great.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.095
I can't believe it.
This is the future.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.389
Wait a minute.
Everything looks the same.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.140
Well, of course,
it's only been 30 years.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.725
But, I say, where are
the monuments to me?

03:03.809 --> 03:05.143
Where are my
legions of followers?

03:05.227 --> 03:07.229
I thought
I'd be absolute ruler of the world by now.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.314
Far away from that
house full of idiots.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.160
(SIGHS)

03:22.244 --> 03:25.372
Sorry, Stewie, I abandoned
my quest for world domination long ago.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.416
Well, am I at least
a city councilman or something?

03:27.499 --> 03:28.500
Sorry.

03:28.584 --> 03:29.918
Oh, this is nothing
like I imagined.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.295
I thought the future
would be different,

03:31.378 --> 03:33.255
with jet packs,
eco-domes, and TV

03:33.338 --> 03:35.424
they can beam
right into your head.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.301
Uh, give me Mork & Mindy.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.385
(ELECTRONIC HUMMING)

03:38.468 --> 03:43.265
(LAUGHING)
That's not how you sit in a chair.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.309
Now I'm late
to Sunday dinner with the family,

03:45.392 --> 03:47.686
so you'll have to wait in the car
until I can send you back.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.147
Wait in the car?
I shall do no such thing.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.482
Oh, hey,
did they ever unfreeze Walt Disney?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.817
Unfortunately.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.194
Welcome back,
Mr. Disney.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.528
Are the Jews gone yet?

03:56.612 --> 03:57.821
Uh, no.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.114
Put me back in.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.576
(DOORBELL RINGING)

04:04.036 --> 04:05.621
Oh, Stu, my big boy!

04:05.704 --> 04:07.247
Hello, mother.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.458
She's still alive?

04:09.541 --> 04:10.918
What the hell, man?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.586
I hope you don't mind,
but I brought a guest.

04:12.669 --> 04:16.632
This is, uh, Pablo, a child from Nicaragua
that I've been sponsoring.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.634
My, how wonderful.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.594
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

04:20.677 --> 04:22.971
Yes. Is that where you got
that leather handbag?

04:23.055 --> 04:24.765
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's your face!

04:24.848 --> 04:26.433
(LAUGHING)
Oh, got you!

04:26.517 --> 04:29.353
30 years later,
I still freakin' got you!

04:29.436 --> 04:30.771
Oh, God.

04:30.854 --> 04:34.483
Oh, I feel as
invincible as Superman.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.778
Hey, there, Wonder Woman.
Flying your invisible plane, I see.

04:37.861 --> 04:38.987
Uh...

04:39.071 --> 04:41.448
Boy, this is awkward. I'm...

04:41.532 --> 04:44.785
I'm actually in the lavatory
of the invisible plane.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.245
Oh, you mean
right now you're...

04:46.328 --> 04:48.121
Yeah.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.748
(FLUSHING)

04:53.460 --> 04:56.255
So I couldn't help
but notice you didn't wash your hands

04:56.338 --> 04:58.340
in the invisible sink.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.342
Hi, everybody.
Sorry we're late.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.635
Stop (BLEEP)
apologizing.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.053
You sound like
a (BLEEP) woman.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.347
Oh, I suppose
one of you has to.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.016
Oh, what a nice blouse,
Vanessa.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.518
Chris' wife.
Oh, thanks.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.937
I'm not sure my tiny brain
could've put that one together.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.357
Hi, Vanessa.
Well, don't you look nice?

05:15.440 --> 05:18.026
Oh, no, I broke my hip!

05:18.110 --> 05:19.111
You need some help, Dad?

05:19.194 --> 05:20.404
No, I'm good.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.823
Oh, are these the pictures
from your trip to Sonoma?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.616
Oh, my God.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.869
Oh, look how beautiful
the countryside is.

05:26.952 --> 05:30.497
Oh, I would love to
get a house out there if I had the money.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.957
Knock, knock.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.417
Oh, hi, Ron.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.252
Who's that fellow?
He looks so familiar.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.671
It's Meg.
She had a sex change right after college.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.048
Wow! She went to college?

05:40.132 --> 05:41.383
I can't stay too late.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.135
I gotta go shop
for a razor.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.762
You know, for my face,
where I grow my beard.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.764
Okay, we get it, Ron.
You're a guy.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.686
Well, there he is.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.232
Oh, this is fantastic!

05:57.316 --> 05:58.942
That's not really
appropriate, Stewie.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.862
Oh, of course it is. I loathed
that know-it-all, flea-bitten mutt.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.114
No, no, it's just
that the meaning of that word has changed

06:04.198 --> 06:05.657
ever since
President Douchebag.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.117
(CROWD CHEERING)

06:07.201 --> 06:09.912
Thank you. I just received a call
from my worthy opponent,

06:09.995 --> 06:11.288
Senator Daterape.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.539
(CROWD BOOING)

06:12.623 --> 06:14.875
No, no,
he ran a good campaign,

06:14.958 --> 06:17.336
but the people of
America have spoken,

06:17.419 --> 06:21.173
and they're saying
they want four more years of Douchebag.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.760
ALL: Douchebag!
Douchebag! Douchebag!

06:28.138 --> 06:30.849
That is some (BLEEP)
good dinner, Mrs. Griffin.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.519
Thank you. Excuse me.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.771
I'm gonna go help
Peter with the dishes.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.481
Ron, Stu, I need your help.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.358
I need you two to tell
those parents of yours

06:39.441 --> 06:40.817
they're moving into
a retirement home,

06:40.901 --> 06:44.029
'cause Mr. Empty Sack
over here won't do it.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.864
Stu, you don't want
Mom and Dad

06:45.948 --> 06:47.658
to go to
a retirement home, do you?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.826
Well, it's...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.328
Uh...

06:51.411 --> 06:52.579
(IMITATING LOIS)
Stu, could you help me with the dishes?

06:52.663 --> 06:53.914
Oh, be right there, Mother.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.415
Well, actually,
Vanessa, I'd...

06:55.499 --> 06:56.875
(IMITATING LOIS)
Oh, Stu, I need your help.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.710
There are dishes
everywhere.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.504
Oh, sorry, must go.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.880
Well, I can't do it to them.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.423
They're my parents.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.717
Don't you ever want
to inherit this house, you fat (BLEEP)?

07:05.801 --> 07:07.427
Or am I the only one
who has any desire to move out

07:07.511 --> 07:09.137
from under
the (BLEEP) power lines?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.306
What's that?
Oh, it's cancer!

07:11.390 --> 07:14.560
Can we please not do this
in front of Pablo?

07:14.643 --> 07:16.019
That kid's from Guam.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.938
Probably only speaks
Spanish or some (BLEEP).

07:18.021 --> 07:19.606
Let me tell you something,
Nessa.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.441
A bullet sounds the same
in every language.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.861
So stick a (BLEEP) sock in it,
you cow!

07:26.113 --> 07:28.365
Well, welcome to Chez Stu.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.285
Dear God,
this is where I live?

07:31.368 --> 07:32.953
All alone in a filthy hovel?

07:33.036 --> 07:34.788
Well, I wouldn't
exactly say alone.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.124
Let me introduce my roommate.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.542
He's sometimes
late on the rent

07:38.625 --> 07:41.253
and never shy about
sharing the gas bill,

07:41.336 --> 07:42.713
if you know what I mean.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.798
Did you just
make a fart joke?

07:44.882 --> 07:46.466
Hey, Stu,
got big plans for tonight?

07:46.550 --> 07:47.843
Sure do, Rupert.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.179
I'm finally going to organize
my photo albums.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.763
Yeah, right.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.348
I say,
what happened to his leg?

07:53.432 --> 07:54.892
Oh, wait, now I remember.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.810
You are really
going to sit there with a straight face

07:56.894 --> 07:58.520
and tell me a flat tax
doesn't favor the wealthy?

07:58.604 --> 07:59.688
Not one bit.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.148
And it saves
millions of man-hours

08:01.231 --> 08:03.358
that the complexity
of the current tax code wastes,

08:03.442 --> 08:05.819
which you would realize
if you weren't retarded.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.112
Hey, give him back!

08:07.196 --> 08:08.363
Stop that!
What are you doing?

08:08.447 --> 08:09.489
Give me back his leg!

08:09.573 --> 08:10.741
Oh, you'll get it back.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.581
And this is my bulletin board
where I put all my favorite comic strips.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.541
See? See, look,
here's the Lockhorns.

08:19.625 --> 08:23.253
See, Mrs. Lockhorn is saying,
"We're never going to another yard sale,"

08:23.337 --> 08:26.757
because Mr. Lockhorn
has clearly purchased a tuba.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.842
(CHUCKLES) And from
the look on her face,

08:28.926 --> 08:31.178
I'd say he's not
playing it very well at all.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.638
(LAUGHING)

08:32.721 --> 08:33.972
You get it?

08:34.056 --> 08:36.475
You got these
from Parade magazine?

08:36.558 --> 08:38.894
You read Parade magazine?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.354
(GROANS)

08:40.437 --> 08:44.983
Hey, Stu. It's Monday,
which can only mean one thing,

08:45.067 --> 08:48.028
Go-Gurt day!
Go-Gurt day!

08:48.111 --> 08:50.155
Oh, Fran, this is Pablo,
from Nicaragua.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.492
Pablo, this is Fran.
She is hilarious.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.077
Hi, Pablo.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.871
Just kidding.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.456
I told you.
She's so twisted.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.458
Well, I'd better get
back to my department

09:01.542 --> 09:04.503
before Genghis,
the day manager, makes his rounds.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.963
"Genghis, the day manager"?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.131
Is that from something
or did you just make that up?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.508
I just made it up.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.552
(LAUGHING)

09:11.635 --> 09:13.011
All day long.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.221
Well, I guess
it's not all bad.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.389
What do you mean?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.015
Don't be coy,
you dirty horndog.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.517
You're nailing Fran.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.185
Tell me,
how many times have we gotten

09:20.269 --> 09:21.812
into those Lane Bryant
stretch pants?

09:21.895 --> 09:22.980
What? Never!

09:23.063 --> 09:24.106
Damn right never...

09:24.189 --> 09:25.691
What do you mean,
"Never"?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.860
(SIGHS) Stewie, I've never
slept with any woman.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.778
I've never had sex.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.990
All right, that's it!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.992
I could handle the crappy apartment
and the pedestrian job,

09:35.075 --> 09:36.493
but now you're telling me

09:36.577 --> 09:39.204
I'm a 35-year-old,
Parade- magazine-reading virgin.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.039
Well, you, sir, are pathetic!

09:41.123 --> 09:43.166
So forget about
sending me back, because I'm not leaving

09:43.250 --> 09:45.127
until we do
a complete overhaul

09:45.210 --> 09:47.004
on this sad thing
you call our life!

09:47.087 --> 09:48.338
Can I still read Parade?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.715
No, you cannot
still read Parade!

09:56.513 --> 09:58.182
So, what do you think, mmm?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.058
My word,
I've got to hand it to you, Stewie,

10:00.142 --> 10:01.560
it really is an improvement.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.395
And you haven't even
seen the best part.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.773
Stress-release candles
for those extra-tough days at the office.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.483
Oh, you don't
know the half of it.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.152
On Tuesdays I work Returns.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.029
Yeah, I bought this
boom box here,

10:12.112 --> 10:13.864
and it's got this
high-pitched whine.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.073
Well, let's have a look.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.491
(BABY CRYING)

10:16.575 --> 10:18.994
(LAUGHING)
It's yours now, sucker!

10:19.077 --> 10:21.079
All right, now that
you've got a swinging pad,

10:21.163 --> 10:24.750
it's time to
bring Fran back here and, you know.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.627
What?

10:26.710 --> 10:27.961
Well, I have no idea.
I thought you knew.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.254
No, I have no idea.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.006
Well, come on, man.
You're the adult here.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.091
I was counting on you to
know the mechanics because...

10:33.175 --> 10:34.384
Well, let's face it,
as a baby,

10:34.468 --> 10:36.720
all I've got to go on
is beer commercial innuendo

10:36.803 --> 10:38.931
and that myth
about where babies come from.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.018
Oh, my God, the stork!

10:47.856 --> 10:49.775
Where's my baby?

10:49.858 --> 10:52.653
(IN DEEP VOICE) Sweetie, you and me
are gonna make the baby.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.821
(FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING)

10:58.158 --> 10:59.826
Kids,
what are you doing here?

10:59.910 --> 11:03.789
Mom, Dad, Vanessa wants us
to put you guys in a retirement home,

11:03.872 --> 11:05.332
but I think
it's ridiculous.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.167
A retirement home?

11:07.251 --> 11:09.962
Now, Vanessa says
it's not that bad, Mom.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.840
She says they have people there
who will wipe your bottom.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.300
You gotta be yanking me!
That is sweet!

11:15.384 --> 11:17.302
Yeah, that doesn't
sound ridiculous at all, Meg.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.638
My name is Ron.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.974
Oh, I wish Brian were here.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.309
He'd never let you
put us in a home.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.937
Oh, but at least he's
in a better place now.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.230
Wow, look at me.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.148
Hanging out,
drinking with Ernest Hemingway,

11:30.232 --> 11:32.317
Van Gogh,
and Kurt Cobain.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.694
Still, it feels
like we all got here

11:33.777 --> 11:35.028
a little earlier
than we should have.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.030
Yeah, well,
I finally collapsed

11:37.114 --> 11:38.991
under the weight
of my own genius

11:39.074 --> 11:40.242
and shot myself.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.952
I could not reconcile
my passion

11:42.035 --> 11:43.579
with the way people
around me were living,

11:43.662 --> 11:44.746
so I shot myself.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.540
I hated
the thought of my music

11:46.623 --> 11:48.709
becoming part
of some bland, corporate mechanism,

11:48.792 --> 11:50.043
so I shot myself.

11:50.127 --> 11:53.964
Yeah, I got into the garbage
and ate some chocolate.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.471
- My word! Yes, evidently the razor
- wasn't invented

12:01.555 --> 12:03.724
till sometime
in the late '80s.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.017
Okay, then, let's begin.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.894
And here we go.
And watch my hand.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.396
And one, two, three,
and in and out, and in and out.

12:09.479 --> 12:13.108
I am the monarch of the sea
The ruler of the Queen's Navy

12:13.192 --> 12:15.068
Whose praise Great
Britain loudly chants

12:15.152 --> 12:16.820
And we are his sisters
and his cousins and his aunts

12:16.904 --> 12:18.739
Good, good.
You've got the rhythm.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.033
Now, let's try it with the Swiss cheese
and take it from the top.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.545
I really enjoyed the movie tonight
and I'm not tired at all.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.130
Oh, yeah, good, good.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.757
I enjoyed the movie, too.

12:38.717 --> 12:42.137
Oh, hey, I hear they're
extending our store hours until 9:30.

12:42.221 --> 12:45.224
Oh, that's...
That's great.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.060
Let's have sex!
What?

12:48.143 --> 12:49.645
Definitely,
I'll be right back.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.313
What the hell is
wrong with you? I can't do this!

12:51.396 --> 12:52.481
I can't go through
with this.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.565
Why? Why the hell not?

12:53.649 --> 12:54.691
I'm too nervous.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.693
FRAN: I'm getting
my diaphragm!

12:56.777 --> 12:58.779
See, I don't even
know what that is.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.572
-Get in there! Get in there right now.
- I can't.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.199
Get in!
No, no, no.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.825
Listen to me.
You listen to me, Stewart Griffin.

13:03.909 --> 13:06.245
You march in
there right now and

13:06.328 --> 13:09.623
"insert your penis
into her vagina." Go!

13:13.669 --> 13:16.296
I'm sorry. That's...

13:16.380 --> 13:18.382
That's never
happened to me before.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.010
Which part? The eight seconds of sex
or the 40 minutes of crying?

13:22.094 --> 13:23.720
Uh, I guess both.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.141
Do I... Do I give you
money or something?

13:28.809 --> 13:30.561
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.233
Eight seconds! That's twice as good
as you did in rehearsal.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.735
Stu, I heard from Juan
in Car Stereo Installation

13:38.819 --> 13:40.404
about what you did
to Fran last night.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.447
You know,
intra-office sex is prohibited,

13:42.531 --> 13:45.993
regardless of how
hilariously brief and unsatisfying it was.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.327
(GASPS)
You're fired.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.374
Oh, cheer up!
You didn't need that crappy job anyway.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.792
You are not
allowed to speak.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.335
You have ruined everything.

13:55.419 --> 13:57.796
Oh, nice, I donate my time
trying to fix your pathetic life

13:57.880 --> 13:59.423
and this is the thanks I get?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.925
Good Lord!
My apartment!

14:03.969 --> 14:05.596
Looks like the cause
of the fire

14:05.679 --> 14:07.306
were these stress-release
candles, sir.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.725
Huh. Irony!

14:16.607 --> 14:17.858
I don't know, Peter.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.234
This place is
pretty depressing.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.320
What are you talking about?
It's just like old times.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.571
Hey, Cleveland.

14:22.654 --> 14:28.368
(EXTREMELY SLOWLY)
Hello, Peter.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.287
Hey, Joe,
how are things since the operation?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.663
Oh, great, Peter.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.081
(CHUCKLES)

14:33.165 --> 14:36.668
Who would've guessed
I'd be one of the few not in a wheelchair.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.170
I sure do miss Bonnie,
though.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.672
Well, it's amazing
they were able to give you her legs.

14:40.756 --> 14:44.635
Who wears short shorts?
I wear short shorts!

14:44.718 --> 14:46.220
Hey, Glenn.
How's the arthritis?

14:46.303 --> 14:47.554
Not bad.

14:47.638 --> 14:49.681
Of course, since you walked in,
I'm feeling a little stiff.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.558
Giggity Gi...
Oh, I just pooped a little.

14:51.642 --> 14:56.271
(VERY SLOWLY)
Oh, that's nasty.

14:58.524 --> 14:59.691
Um...

14:59.775 --> 15:01.902
Hey, you know what I do
when I'm feeling down?

15:01.985 --> 15:03.612
I play the Glad Game.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.823
I think about all the things
that make me glad. Let's try it, shall we?

15:06.907 --> 15:07.991
Um...

15:08.659 --> 15:10.661
Pinwheels.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.580
A big wedge of cake
from the fair.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.125
A doodad to wear
in your hat.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.129
All right, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.631
(SIGHS)
No, it's my fault.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.592
My whole life's been a mess
ever since that near-death experience.

15:25.676 --> 15:26.885
I mean,
nothing goes right...

15:26.969 --> 15:28.136
Wait, wait, wait.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.763
Near-death experience?

15:29.847 --> 15:31.306
At the community pool?

15:31.390 --> 15:32.808
But... But that was nothing.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.935
Well, that's what
I thought at first.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.771
But around the time of my 20th birthday,
I started having nightmares.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.523
And then my therapist
said I'd been suppressing

15:39.606 --> 15:41.024
some very complex emotions

15:41.108 --> 15:43.193
that may well have caused me
to take fewer risks.

15:43.277 --> 15:46.029
Well, then, it seems
there's only one thing to do.

15:46.113 --> 15:49.199
I must return to the past
to ensure that I never have the close call

15:49.324 --> 15:51.285
with that lifeguard tower
in the first place.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.037
Oh, I just thought
of another one for the Glad Game.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.583
The first scissor cut
into a fresh piece of construction paper.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.501
Oh, yeah.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.467
All right,
here's what we do.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.428
You buy me
one of those time-travel watches,

16:09.511 --> 16:11.013
and I'll go back
to my own time

16:11.096 --> 16:12.556
and stop that
near-death experience.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.932
I can't afford one.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.225
I don't have a job,
thanks to you.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.269
I say, how hard is it
to get a new job?

16:17.352 --> 16:19.104
Even I had that job
at the airport.

16:20.564 --> 16:23.650
Jonny Quest.
Okay, welcome aboard.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.028
Dr. Benton Quest.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.696
All right,
have a good flight.

16:28.906 --> 16:29.907
Hadji!

16:29.990 --> 16:31.825
Hmm. Uh...

16:31.909 --> 16:33.869
Listen, you've been randomly selected
for additional screening.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.954
But you didn't even
type anything in.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.165
Look, if it were up to me,
you'd be right there on that flight.

16:38.248 --> 16:42.711
But I'm gonna need you to take off
your shoes and that lovely hat.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.087
Sim, sim, salabim!

16:44.171 --> 16:46.131
Yeah, I'd cut back on that.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.258
We'll have to
borrow the money from Mommy and Daddy.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.385
(SCREAMS)
Never call them that again!

16:50.469 --> 16:52.179
It's Lois and the Fat Man,
do you hear me?

16:52.262 --> 16:54.056
Yes, yes!

16:54.139 --> 16:56.683
Smells like Head & Shoulders,
but you don't have dandruff.

16:56.767 --> 16:57.893
Exactly!

16:57.976 --> 16:59.228
Ah!

17:02.814 --> 17:05.526
Oh, hey, you two.
What brings you here?

17:05.609 --> 17:07.653
Lois, Pablo here
needs your help.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.696
Stu, can we drop
the whole Pablo thing?

17:09.780 --> 17:11.907
Do you think
I don't remember my own little Stewie?

17:11.990 --> 17:14.535
You clever, clever shrew.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.954
Stu, you could get in
a lot of trouble for this.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.039
You need to take him
back to his own time.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.832
Well, that's why we're here.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.626
I need a loan.
Done.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.295
This is a secret account
Peter can't access.

17:25.379 --> 17:27.005
I never could
trust him with money.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.757
Like the time
he spent Meg's college money

17:28.841 --> 17:30.467
on that medieval catapult.

17:31.385 --> 17:33.428
(PETER LAUGHING)

17:33.512 --> 17:36.682
Excellent, these dominos are set up
exactly as I want them,

17:36.765 --> 17:38.267
right next to
the good china.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.644
Now, I'll just place
this priceless Faberge egg

17:40.727 --> 17:43.814
in the center, right next to
my newborn hemophiliac baby.

17:43.897 --> 17:44.898
(THUD)

17:44.982 --> 17:46.608
Hey, those yours?
Yes.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.152
Oh. Those are all
really nice things.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.404
Thank you!

17:50.487 --> 17:51.572
You hear that, Evan?

17:51.655 --> 17:52.823
We were complimented.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.453
Well, I suppose this is it.

17:58.537 --> 17:59.872
Wow!

17:59.955 --> 18:01.707
You know, it just hit me
that if you are successful

18:01.790 --> 18:03.959
in preventing our
near-death experience,

18:04.042 --> 18:06.211
it'll turn me into
an entirely different Stu.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.713
Then you know
what you should do?

18:07.796 --> 18:09.590
Since the timeline
is gonna change anyway,

18:09.673 --> 18:11.216
you should get really fat.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.468
Like, just go buy
a whole pint of ice cream

18:13.552 --> 18:15.679
and shovel down
the whole thing.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.222
I mean, just really pig out.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.765
Ooh, that's brilliant.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.560
Hey, and if the city
thinks I'm paying this parking ticket,

18:21.643 --> 18:23.395
they are dreaming.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.607
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:26.690 --> 18:29.234
No, I'm not really gonna do it.
You know, just in case.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.820
Goodbye, Stewie.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.197
So long, Stu.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.161
Damn! I overshot it.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.456
"1974, University of Denver."

18:42.539 --> 18:44.791
I say,
Condoleezza Rice goes here.

18:44.875 --> 18:50.464
Damn, I am never gonna
let the Man get me down, crazy crackers!

18:50.547 --> 18:53.133
Black Panthers,
stand tall!

19:01.225 --> 19:03.644
Blast!
This isn't the pool either.

19:03.727 --> 19:07.648
But at least I've arrived
on the correct date.

19:07.731 --> 19:10.317
But there are only 30 minutes
before the tower falls.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.406
Damn, I've gotta
get to that swim meet.

19:28.377 --> 19:29.878
Hi, Stewie Griffin.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.964
Stewie Griffin,
hi, how are you?

19:36.260 --> 19:38.387
Smells good.
Dinner's ready.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.713
(PANTING)

20:12.796 --> 20:14.590
Probably shouldn't
have milked that landing.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.104
Don't press that,

20:29.188 --> 20:32.024
future 35-year-old virgin.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.444
Fran! Fran!

20:35.527 --> 20:36.528
Fran...

20:36.612 --> 20:37.613
What the devil?

20:38.906 --> 20:40.282
Yes, I did it!

20:40.365 --> 20:41.700
I stopped the tower
from falling!

20:41.783 --> 20:43.660
Who are you?
I'm you from the future.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.162
From the future?

20:45.245 --> 20:48.207
My word. Did they ever find
a successful vehicle for Ellen Cleghorne?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.501
Oh, that's so funny.
I asked that very same question

20:50.584 --> 20:51.835
and never got
an answer.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.046
Well, then, you're as
disposable as she is!

20:54.129 --> 20:56.215
Oh, come on,
my little champion.

20:56.298 --> 20:59.635
Oh, my God, at least have the decency
to carry me, you lazy skank.

20:59.718 --> 21:00.886
Of course,
it is comfortable.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.721
(SNORING)

21:02.804 --> 21:05.766
Hey, thanks again
for explaining football to me, mister.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.851
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.061
You can call me Ron.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.437
Ron, huh?

21:10.521 --> 21:13.398
You know,
I've always really liked that name.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.608
Ron.
