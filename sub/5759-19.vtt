00:01.430 --> 00:02.522
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.730 --> 00:05.197
I came over to apologize.

00:05.230 --> 00:06.299
I hope that you
and your mom are okay.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.591
I have a message for you.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.107
Ali wants to
meet me tonight.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.209
Did you tell
anyone about this?

00:10.240 --> 00:11.605
I can't believe
you followed me here.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.073
What's the deal
with Mona?

00:13.110 --> 00:14.372
BOY: We met in
a group at school.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.207
There's a new counselor
and he's actually cool.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.548
Mona is the devil, and I
would really appreciate it

00:18.580 --> 00:20.309
if you didn't encourage
them being together.

00:20.350 --> 00:21.647
It's time to share, Andrew.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.386
I want some of your
study aid,

00:23.420 --> 00:25.513
the kind with the
child-proof cap.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.017
Dad!
I'm coming, baby.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.395
Dad.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.129
Who eats pie with beer?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.297
Mr. Fitz?

00:36.330 --> 00:37.365
A boysenberry pie and beer,

00:37.400 --> 00:38.424
that's what you ordered?

00:38.470 --> 00:39.767
The police
used dental records

00:39.800 --> 00:41.233
to prove that body
was Alison's

00:41.270 --> 00:43.306
and we know it wasn't.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.637
I was at the dentist

00:44.670 --> 00:46.604
and I think that I got
treated by "A."

00:46.640 --> 00:50.098
One of you just please
look inside my mouth.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.572
"I told you.
Dead girls can't smile.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.578
Stop looking.
lAllll

00:57.890 --> 01:00.051
I need it.
There's no other choice.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.380
WOMAN: ( on phone )
I know I told you
to avoid her

01:03.430 --> 01:04.727
but you'll have to
get in touch with her.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.193
And when you do...

01:07.600 --> 01:08.498
Yes.

01:08.530 --> 01:11.590
That is exactly
what you say, nothing more.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.131
She can't know yet.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.207
Do you think
you can get to it?

01:17.240 --> 01:18.434
I'll be careful.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.505
I'll call you back
on this phone and tell you

01:19.540 --> 01:21.235
where to take it.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.749
Your friends
just walked in.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.274
Shana?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.844
Shana, tell me
you can get it.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.188
I have to go.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.085
Guys.

01:36.290 --> 01:38.224
Have you heard her
from since?

01:38.260 --> 01:39.522
Can we trust her now?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.551
If All does, I guess
that means we should try.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.262
Shana has too many
faces to trust.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.291
I've been keeping count
and running out of fingers.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.365
We all got
a finger you can use.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.606
It's not the nice kind.

01:53.510 --> 01:54.499
* Got a secret

01:54.540 --> 01:55.677
* Can you keep it?

01:55.710 --> 01:58.349
* Swear this one you'll save

01:58.380 --> 02:00.712
* Better lock it,
in your pocket *

02:00.750 --> 02:03.480
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:03.520 --> 02:05.784
* If I show you
then they know you *

02:05.820 --> 02:08.482
* Won't tell what I said

02:08.520 --> 02:10.784
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:10.830 --> 02:13.298
* If one of them is dead

02:18.530 --> 02:21.294
So is your dad
going to be okay?

02:21.340 --> 02:23.399
They'll monitor his heart
for a while to make sure,

02:23.440 --> 02:25.601
but in the long run,
he should be fine.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.733
Except the part where Shana
gave him a heart attack.

02:27.780 --> 02:28.872
It wasn't a heart attack.

02:28.910 --> 02:31.708
_The doctors said his chest _
pains were caused from anemia.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.274
Besides, I don't think
it was her.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.447
I mean Shana led me to Ali.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.310
Why would she turn around

02:36.350 --> 02:37.783
and punish me
for trying to find "A"?

02:37.820 --> 02:39.811
And we know that
"A" is a dude.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.953
Maybe Shana's
helping this dude.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.924
Wasn't she seen sneaking
around Wren's apartment

02:43.960 --> 02:45.655
shipping boxes to Melissa?

02:45.690 --> 02:49.899
Sure, but let's say
it's not Shana, you know.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.488
Could be somebody else?

02:51.530 --> 02:53.566
Maybe it's somebody
who's working on the play

02:53.600 --> 02:55.329
with Mr. Fitz.

02:55.370 --> 02:56.735
I was the first crew member
he brought on.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.533
And he asked you to meet him
after school, right?

02:58.570 --> 03:00.333
Yeah, he asked me to copy
audition scenes

03:00.380 --> 03:01.529
while he was out
runnIng an errand.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.377
He said he'd come by
if he could.

03:03.410 --> 03:04.638
What about you, Aria?

03:06.880 --> 03:09.587
I was just wondering if maybe
since you and Jake broke up...

03:09.620 --> 03:11.440
Yeah, that doesn't mean
we're back together.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.357
Look, look, I've been
taking some time for myself.

03:14.390 --> 03:15.789
Ezra and I haven't_talked in
a really long time.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.822
Do you think
you could ask him?
No.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.454
No asking, no following,
no taking a look.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.263
"A" gave us an order
in my mouth.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.518
I'm just trying to
help Emily figure out
who was chasing her.

03:24.570 --> 03:25.992
Yeah, but Emily already said
that Ezra wasn't there.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.964
I don't know what kind
of help he would be.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.228
Yeah.

03:29.270 --> 03:30.806
You're right.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.570
I'm cutting you off.
You're over-caffeinated.

03:33.610 --> 03:34.907
What?
It's herbal tea.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.032
Spencer, I'm about to have
a breakdown, okay,

03:36.080 --> 03:38.571
and your floppy foot is
gonna push me over the edge.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.544
So go sit over there, okay.
We're all really tense.

03:40.580 --> 03:41.672
Tense?

03:41.720 --> 03:42.812
"A" knocked me out,

03:42.850 --> 03:44.442
shot me up
and played post office

03:44.490 --> 03:45.787
between my teeth.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.219
"Dead girls can't smile."

03:49.460 --> 03:51.018
If we don't keep
trying to help Ali,

03:51.060 --> 03:52.152
she'll never be able
to come home.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.420
Yeah, and the longer that
she's out there on her own,

03:54.460 --> 03:55.825
the easier it is
for "A" to get to her.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.725
We're not doing anything.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.635
We're just gonna wait
for her to contact us again.

03:59.670 --> 04:01.331
Yeah, if she contacts us.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.598
We don't know that for sure.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.303
Can we just all agree
on this to keep us safe?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.442
Yeah, of course.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.411
Yeah, absolutely.

04:19.090 --> 04:20.717
* Sail!

04:28.930 --> 04:32.889
* Maybe I'm a different breed

04:32.940 --> 04:36.933
* Maybe I'm not listening

04:36.970 --> 04:39.973
* So blame it on my A.D.D.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.034
* Baby

04:43.610 --> 04:44.941
* Sail

04:47.680 --> 04:49.318
* Sail

04:51.650 --> 04:53.015
* Sail

05:19.750 --> 05:20.978
( beeps )

05:44.870 --> 05:46.064
Good morning.

05:46.110 --> 05:49.671
Is Dr. Griggs in?
This is Veronica Hastings.

05:49.710 --> 05:50.938
Thank you.

05:50.980 --> 05:53.574
A break-in?

05:55.150 --> 05:57.584
No, no,
nothing was stolen.

05:57.620 --> 05:58.780
But I got a chance to chat

05:58.820 --> 06:00.754
with the sheriff's
office last week.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.849
They said it was most
likely a vagrant

06:02.890 --> 06:05.450
looking for shelter
or kids looking

06:05.490 --> 06:06.889
for a place to party.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.591
I mean it's an empty cabin.
What do you expect?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.122
So I have to go up there
this weekend.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.559
Can you get away?
Come with me?

06:14.600 --> 06:16.761
It's been a while since
we've been up there.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.769
My dad's going up to Syracuse
and I can't leave Mike.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.644
Is there any way your brother
could stay with a friend?

06:24.680 --> 06:27.478
Maybe we could drive back
and check on him?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.748
Just tell him and my dad
that I'm staying

06:28.780 --> 06:30.111
at Hanna's or something.

06:30.150 --> 06:32.118
Aria, I really need to save
the whole weekend.

06:32.150 --> 06:34.983
And I thought
we were going to actually

06:35.020 --> 06:36.578
be able to use this cabin.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.655
I'd like to spend some time
alone with you.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.791
Okay, you know what,

06:42.830 --> 06:45.094
I'll figure something
out with Mike.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.836
When do you want to leave?

06:50.940 --> 06:52.828
Okay, this is the last of it.
Where do you want it?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.472
I want what's in them.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.908
I checked.
Everything that we seized

06:57.950 --> 06:59.474
from your house
has been accounted for.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.647
I've missed you.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.784
Wow. I helped an old lady
find her missing cat once.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.185
I don't think
she was half as happy.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.152
I finally feel like
I have feet again.

07:14.930 --> 07:18.229
So how did those books
work out for you?

07:18.270 --> 07:19.089
You finish the one
about the teeth?

07:19.130 --> 07:21.564
You know, they kind of
creeped me out.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.034
I mean, I feel like
I have to floss like crazy

07:24.070 --> 07:26.106
so I don't have to go to
the dentist anytime soon.

07:26.140 --> 07:27.607
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.073
Well, if you're looking
for another--

07:29.110 --> 07:31.977
Actually, I'm giving up
on mysteries for a while.

07:32.010 --> 07:34.740
You know,
I was gonna sell them
back to the store used,

07:34.780 --> 07:36.714
but you can have
all of them if you want.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.480
No, no, I'm up to my holster
in all things

07:39.520 --> 07:40.589
CeCe Drake these days.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.781
Funny thing about fugitives,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.479
they generate
a lot of paperwork.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.752
Can't skip
to the end, can you?

07:47.800 --> 07:48.892
I wish.

07:48.930 --> 07:52.934
Interviews, official reports,
even a false sighting,

07:52.970 --> 07:55.859
it's all worth going through
with a fine-tooth comb.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.869
You get details about
habits and routines,

07:58.910 --> 08:00.775
personality traits.

08:00.810 --> 08:02.949
"It's the little things
that are infinitely

08:02.980 --> 08:04.174
the most important."

08:04.210 --> 08:06.007
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
said that.

08:18.890 --> 08:20.653
Was it her
on the phone last night?

08:20.700 --> 08:22.827
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.997
How is she?
Is she okay?

08:25.030 --> 08:27.032
If she wanted to
give you an update,

08:27.070 --> 08:27.934
she'd reach out to you.

08:27.970 --> 08:30.200
Oh, wait, she did
and you screwed it up.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.573
Hey, can we not
do snide, Shana?

08:33.610 --> 08:35.601
I want us to help
each other help Alison.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.870
How? Start a
"Friends of Ali" club?

08:37.910 --> 08:40.071
Make collages
and write fan fiction?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.576
( bell ringing )

08:43.190 --> 08:44.543
I'm going to be late.

08:46.790 --> 08:48.587
Next time you talk to her,

08:48.620 --> 08:50.281
can you tell her
that I'm sorry?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.726
I'll see what I can do.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.298
So what's up with Spencer?
Did you notice her last night?

09:02.340 --> 09:05.264
All jittery and
caffeine bug-eyed?

09:05.310 --> 09:07.574
That's pretty much
Spencer most days.

09:07.610 --> 09:08.929
She's probably just
studying for something.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.800
She was drinking
herbal tea.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.772
That girl is
strictly espresso.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.641
She's not studying,
she's investigating.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.080
Sounds like _
you're Investigating.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.657
I'm just observing details.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.918
I was talking to Gabe and--

09:21.960 --> 09:22.927
VVho?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.723
Holbrook.
And he was telling--

09:24.760 --> 09:28.218
Wait, wait, wait.
Detective Holbrook?

09:28.260 --> 09:29.818
Are you guys,
like friends now?

09:30.930 --> 09:33.034
Friends? No.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.038
Okay, I didn't even know
that he had a first name

09:35.070 --> 09:37.709
and now
you're calling him Gabe?

09:37.740 --> 09:38.729
Is he into fashion
or something?

09:38.770 --> 09:39.771
No, Aria.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.038
Well, I'm just trying to
figure out

09:41.080 --> 09:42.968
what you two would
be connecting on.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.773
We're just like
book club buddies

09:44.810 --> 09:47.074
without the monthly meetings.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.872
Anyway, he just told me
something that I think

09:48.920 --> 09:50.217
Spencer might be--

09:50.250 --> 09:51.285
Hanna, she asked
a few questions.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.288
She was trying to ﬁgure out
who went after Emily

09:53.320 --> 09:54.355
that night in school.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.312
She's not telling us
the truth, Aria.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.385
Can we just spend some time
with her this weekend?

09:58.430 --> 10:01.194
Talk some sense into her
before she pisses "A" off?

10:01.230 --> 10:03.960
Um, I'm visiting my dad.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.661
He's lecturing in Syracuse

10:05.700 --> 10:08.066
and he wants me to look
at the campus, so...

10:08.100 --> 10:10.364
Well, he goes there
like every weekend.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.502
Can't you just say next time?

10:11.540 --> 10:14.703
Well, I kind of need a break
from Mike and Mona too.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.174
They're just a constant
barrage of slow jams

10:17.210 --> 10:18.302
and lip balm.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.742
I'm sorry, Hanna,
I really wish I could, but--

10:21.780 --> 10:24.214
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure it out.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.225
I'm so sorry.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.825
Bye, guys.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.749
Hey, Brenda, can I grab you
for a second?

11:07.930 --> 11:09.898
So my dad's away on business
and the prescription

11:09.930 --> 11:11.818
is in his briefcase.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.394
You're still
taking them, right?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.465
Indeed I am.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.365
Just two, are you sure?

11:18.940 --> 11:21.306
You know what, I should
probably make it five.

11:21.340 --> 11:24.047
Just in case he forgets
on Monday and then,

11:24.080 --> 11:25.968
you know, I have got a couple
of these tests coming up, so...

11:26.010 --> 11:27.079
It's 50.

11:28.780 --> 11:32.238
I mean, I was just kind of
hoping you could spare them.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.485
Don't haggle, Spencer.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.158
It's tacky.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.327
Fifty for first-timers,

11:37.360 --> 11:39.021
repeat customers
get a discount.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.051
Like at the hoagie shop?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.761
Do I get the tenth one free?

11:45.070 --> 11:46.094
Fifty?

11:46.130 --> 11:47.438
Okay, I can do that.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.262
Here.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.011
Come see me next week
If you need more.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.712
You know, in case
your dad forgets.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.221
Hey, Spencer.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.494
I just finished reading
your essay

12:21.440 --> 12:23.761
on Shirley Jackson's
short story.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.061
Is something wrong with it?

12:25.110 --> 12:27.476
It's sub-par.
It's unusual for you.

12:27.510 --> 12:28.431
In fact,
you've practically

12:28.480 --> 12:31.040
lifted an entire paragraph
from Wikipedia.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.104
How bad is the grade?

12:32.150 --> 12:33.777
It's not about the grade.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.811
I'm just wondering what's been
keeping you so busy lately.

12:37.150 --> 12:38.845
I've just really been swamped.

12:38.890 --> 12:41.085
What, you thought
you'd take a shortcut?

12:41.120 --> 12:42.189
And more importantly,

12:42.220 --> 12:43.289
you thought
I wouldn't figure out

12:43.330 --> 12:44.786
what you've been up to.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.895
I'd like to see you
after school.

12:49.930 --> 12:51.568
No normally I wouldn't
make this exception,

12:51.600 --> 12:52.794
but I think in your case--

12:52.840 --> 12:53.864
I'll take the grade.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.289
You sure?
Yeah.

12:56.340 --> 13:01.437
You know, Spencer, sloppy
work leads to consequences.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.038
I'd hate to see you suffer.

13:23.930 --> 13:24.897
Aria.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.488
Hi.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.430
Oh, sorry.
You were just
on your way out.

13:28.470 --> 13:30.199
Just about to get a refill.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.333
It can wait.
What's going on?

13:32.370 --> 13:34.008
You were right.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.838
I might be a little bit angry
but it's not at my brother.

13:38.180 --> 13:41.911
I think the truth is
I'm just angry at myself.

13:41.950 --> 13:43.019
Is it okay if we talk?

13:52.030 --> 13:53.224
( cell phone ringing )

13:57.530 --> 13:59.498
Hey, Spence, me and Emily
are outside your house.

13:59.530 --> 14:00.633
Open up.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.332
Hey, Hanna,
I'm at the library.

14:03.370 --> 14:04.632
No, you're not.

14:04.670 --> 14:05.898
I can see your car
in the driveway.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.079
I walked.

14:10.510 --> 14:15.015
Um, look, so the police gave me
back my shoes finally

14:15.050 --> 14:16.278
and I was wondering

14:16.320 --> 14:18.311
if you could come over
and help me

14:18.350 --> 14:20.386
make my closet
all neat-frealq.

14:20.420 --> 14:23.355
I would really like to,
but Fitz is making me redo

14:23.390 --> 14:24.857
this essay, so...

14:25.660 --> 14:27.491
Well, come over later?

14:27.530 --> 14:29.395
Yeah, maybe.
I really got to go.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.478
Mike's experiences with Mona,
they are different than mine.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.318
So I have to respect
that, I guess.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.157
I guess I'm just confused.

14:56.190 --> 14:59.079
When you came in here,
you said you were
angry with yourself.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.893
Did you want to get
into that, or...?

15:02.300 --> 15:03.665
Yeah, yeah, it's...

15:06.170 --> 15:07.592
I mean, I just
don't even really know

15:07.640 --> 15:09.631
who I can talk to anymore.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.604
I'm lying to my boyfriend.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.608
I'm lying to my friends
about my boyfriend.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.303
Sounds lonely.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.446
You want to start
with the boyfriend?

15:25.650 --> 15:29.017
Well, this guy and I,

15:29.060 --> 15:31.688
we've had a really
long history.

15:31.730 --> 15:36.155
So my friends just
might not be very supportive

15:36.200 --> 15:39.419
if they knew that
we were back together.

15:39.470 --> 15:41.529
And why do you feel
your friends would disapprove?

15:45.610 --> 15:48.477
You know what, my brother
doesn't have practice today.

15:48.510 --> 15:49.738
I just realized that.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.577
I'm sitting here
talking to you.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.749
Okay, well, I'm glad
you stopped by, Aria.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.509
Yeah, thank you.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.040
Well, he's probably
waiting, 50...

16:10.630 --> 16:12.723
This feels like a stakeout.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.465
Well, there are
no coffee or donuts.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.435
Ergo, no stakeout.

16:17.470 --> 16:19.165
It's not the menu, Hanna.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.632
It's the fact that
we're parked outside

16:20.680 --> 16:22.079
Spencer's house
trying to figure out

16:22.110 --> 16:24.670
what she's doing and
why she just lied to you.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.200
What if she really is
at the library?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.218
Well, did she take her
grandfather clock?

16:28.250 --> 16:29.717
I could hear it clanging
through the phone.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.552
Is that Shana?

16:37.790 --> 16:40.224
What is she doing
at the DiLaurentis's house?

16:40.260 --> 16:42.649
Get down.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.089
Okay, this right here,
this feels like a stakeout.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.496
This doesn't make sense.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.768
Last night at the Brew,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.631
I'm pretty sure
Shana was talking to Ali.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.639
And the next day, she gets in
touch with Alison's mom?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.602
Does Mrs. DiLaurentis
know everything?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.301
Does she know
who's bones are In AlI's grave

16:57.350 --> 16:58.442
or was Shana
over there telling her?

16:58.480 --> 17:00.516
Or they were they talking
about peaches and parasols

17:00.550 --> 17:02.370
and Scarlet O'Hara.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.183
You said they knew
each other from Georgia.

17:06.450 --> 17:08.111
I know I said
we should trust Shana,

17:08.160 --> 17:09.752
but I think
we should follow her.

17:09.790 --> 17:13.294
No. We are not
following anybody.
"A" said that--

17:13.330 --> 17:14.797
But it's okay
if it's one of us?

17:14.830 --> 17:18.322
Should we stop by Aria's next
and dig through her trash?

17:18.370 --> 17:20.258
Maybe you were
right, Hanna.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.131
What if Shana really is
manipulating all of us?

17:22.170 --> 17:23.762
I don't give a flying crap
about Shana.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.539
I care about you.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.231
So if you think
this has anything

17:27.280 --> 17:28.531
even remotely
to do with Alison,

17:28.580 --> 17:30.673
just please
leave it alone.

17:31.710 --> 17:32.802
Let's get out of here.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.676
And this is not
the teacher's lounge.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.678
Man, I keep doing that.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.769
Two doors down
to the right.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.811
Jesse Lindahl?

18:10.850 --> 18:13.353
Student counseling office.
We haven't met yet.

18:13.390 --> 18:16.211
I'm Ezra,
English department.
Fitz. Right.

18:16.260 --> 18:19.457
I'm still making the rounds,
putting all the names to faces.

18:19.490 --> 18:20.525
I hope
I didn't interrupt you.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.862
No, no, I was just
pulling a file.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.822
I'm having an academic issue
with one of my seniors.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.735
Just hoping to get
some background.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.294
Well, if you want to
get to the bottom of it,

18:29.340 --> 18:30.602
you've got to get
them talking, you know.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.378
Do they talk?

18:34.410 --> 18:36.628
Yeah.
You'd be surprised
how much students

18:36.680 --> 18:38.898
are willing to reveal
about what's going on
in their lives,

18:38.950 --> 18:39.700
especially
when they feel like

18:39.750 --> 18:41.274
they have
no one else to talk to.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.514
Right.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.188
It was great
meeting you, Jesse.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.279
You too. _
See you around, FItz.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.651
Yeah.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.594
( doorbell ringing )

19:27.930 --> 19:29.693
I need your help.

19:29.730 --> 19:31.368
Okay.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.924
How can I help you?

19:34.740 --> 19:36.560
Not here. Inside.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.811
If you want my help,
you're gonna have to
answer some questions.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.317
I'm an open book.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.289
So what about Paige?

20:00.330 --> 20:02.457
Was that on purpose?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.491
Did you date her
to get to me?

20:04.530 --> 20:05.963
When _I met her at
swnm camp,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.831
I didn't know you were the one
she was still mooning over.

20:07.870 --> 20:11.408
When I got to town,
I put it all together.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.604
You've always acted like
you want to come between us.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.278
I saw a button
and I pushed.

20:17.310 --> 20:18.971
It let me know
what I needed to know.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.443
Which is?

20:20.480 --> 20:22.414
You're loyal,
fiercely protective,

20:22.450 --> 20:24.247
emotional but not a fool.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.850
Just like Alison said.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.312
Great.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.850
So you were spying on us too?

20:29.890 --> 20:31.357
For Alison?

20:31.390 --> 20:34.689
Not spying,
just taking a look around,

20:34.730 --> 20:35.958
trying to get to know you.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.560
Is that what you were doing
in Wren's apartment?

20:38.600 --> 20:39.897
Trying to get to know him?

20:39.930 --> 20:41.739
He placed an ad.

20:41.770 --> 20:45.467
Hired me to ship and pack
some boxes in a hurry.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.704
When he found out
I go to Rosewood High,

20:46.740 --> 20:48.571
he asked me to be discreet.

20:48.610 --> 20:49.838
Be careful with that.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.507
It's-- It belonged
to Alison's grandmother.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.439
Ali said it was a gift
for someone special.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.869
Wouldn't tell me who.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.239
Now I know.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.981
Emily, I saw you and Hanna
today at Alison's house.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.749
I figure you're probably
going to ask about that too,

21:08.800 --> 21:10.859
so why don't we just
lay it on the table?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.027
Okay.

21:13.070 --> 21:14.890
Could you sit?

21:14.940 --> 21:15.929
You're making me nervous.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.849
I was trying to get
something for Alison,

21:23.880 --> 21:25.541
but I never got a chance.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.571
Her mother was
so happy to see me,

21:27.620 --> 21:28.973
I never got a second alone.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.715
Does she know
Ali's still alive?

21:30.750 --> 21:32.980
No.
Are you sure
you didn't tell her?

21:33.020 --> 21:36.080
Alison doesn't trust anyone
but you.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.985
What were you there to get?

21:38.030 --> 21:41.727
That's where you come in.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.796
There's a poster
in Alison's room,

21:43.830 --> 21:45.991
some French thing with twins.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.603
ARIA: ( on answering machine )
Hi, it's Aria, leave a message.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.919
Hey, Aria.

22:33.950 --> 22:38.978
I know it's early,
but something's been going on

22:39.020 --> 22:43.354
and I really have
to tell somebody about it.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.449
I really have
to tell you about it,

22:47.500 --> 22:51.163
but if I'm right then,

22:51.200 --> 22:53.862
then that would
just break your heart,

22:53.900 --> 22:58.860
and if I'm wrong then you're
gonna hate me forever.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.902
And that would really,
really break my heart.

23:01.940 --> 23:05.671
So... if you could just...

23:05.710 --> 23:08.417
give me a call
when you get this message...

23:08.450 --> 23:09.769
ANSWERING MACHINE:
If you're satisfied

23:09.820 --> 23:11.845
with your voice message,
please press 1.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.688
If you'd like
to re-record your message,

23:14.720 --> 23:16.051
press the star key.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.857
ARIA: ( on answering machine )
Hi, it's Aria, leave a message.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.871
Coffee smells great.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.774
How long have you been up?

23:42.820 --> 23:44.981
I didn't really sleep so well.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.840
You want a cup?

23:46.890 --> 23:48.858
No.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.720
Ezra, I think that you need
to take me home.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.066
Are you still nervous
about being up here?

24:02.670 --> 24:04.661
No, I'm not nervous.

24:04.710 --> 24:05.859
I'm tired.

24:05.910 --> 24:06.968
You didn't sleep
well last night.

24:07.010 --> 24:10.605
No, I am tired of lying
to my family and my friends.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.538
I don't even know how many
different tales I had to spin

24:12.580 --> 24:14.673
just to come up here
to be with you this weekend.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.245
Look, I know that
you have to stay up here,

24:17.280 --> 24:19.942
but is there a bus station
or a traIn nearby that--?

24:19.990 --> 24:22.879
Aria, have you ever
thought that

24:22.920 --> 24:26.549
maybe this feeling
you have of being torn

24:26.590 --> 24:29.753
between me and your friends
is maybe not such a bad thing?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.222
Is it supposed
to be a good thing?

24:31.270 --> 24:32.328
Maybe.

24:32.370 --> 24:35.533
I know it feels like you're
growing away from them,

24:35.570 --> 24:39.529
but maybe this feeling is
you and me growing closer.

24:39.570 --> 24:42.573
Right, but I want to be able

24:42.610 --> 24:44.077
to share that
with my closest friends.

24:44.110 --> 24:45.145
And I agree with you.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.148
And I think we're past
the point in our relationship

24:47.180 --> 24:48.272
where we have to hide.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.211
But if what we have
IS gonng to last,

24:52.250 --> 24:53.888
you have to start thinking me

24:53.920 --> 24:56.184
as the person
you're closest to,

24:56.220 --> 25:00.998
the person that you want
to share everything with.

25:01.030 --> 25:02.759
And I have to do
that with you.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.864
Maybe this was a bad idea..

25:10.910 --> 25:13.731
Starting again
and bringing you up here.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.736
I'm so sorry I didn't mean to
put any pressure on you, Aria.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.975
No, you didn't.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.240
Okay.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.010
Why don't you
think about it while
I take a shower?

25:23.050 --> 25:24.688
And if you still want
to go, I can drive you.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.652
Wait.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.094
No, I want this.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.563
Yeah, I really
want it to work.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.879
Spence.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.718
Hanna, I'm sorry,
I'm just...

25:56.750 --> 25:58.183
Hanna, come on.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.313
I know you were
home yesterday.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.910
I heard that stupid clock.
Why are you ignoring me?

26:02.960 --> 26:04.325
I'm sorry, okay.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.954
It was wrong of me.
I just--

26:06.990 --> 26:08.958
Whatever it is
that you're--
It's nothing.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.695
It doesn't look
like nothing.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.220
It looks like you
haven't been sleeping.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.761
I just really have
a headache, okay.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.869
And so and we were
out of aspirin--

26:15.900 --> 26:16.867
And you're lying again.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.629
I just saw you coming
down that street, okay.

26:18.670 --> 26:19.659
You did not go
to the pharmacy.

26:19.710 --> 26:20.563
I was just
in there earlier.

26:20.610 --> 26:23.647
God! Lying!
Hanna, would
you back off me?

26:29.720 --> 26:32.211
Hey, you two always
fight like that?

26:32.250 --> 26:34.957
No, not really.

26:34.990 --> 26:37.356
I got the impression
she was the levelheaded one.

26:37.390 --> 26:39.085
She usually is.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.824
This is the last place
I remember seeing it.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.020
_ It was a stud _
In a white gold setting.

26:46.070 --> 26:49.039
I've dusted in here weekly
since you and your mother left.

26:49.070 --> 26:51.061
I haven't come across
a diamond earring.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.806
I borrowed it from_
my mom Without asking.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.273
Why don't I go check
the guest bathroom?

26:55.310 --> 26:56.971
Don't worry, dear,
we'll find it.

26:57.010 --> 26:57.999
Thanks.

27:46.390 --> 27:47.891
I found it.

27:47.930 --> 27:49.693
Oh, thank goodness.

27:49.730 --> 27:51.766
Now your mother will never
have to know it was gone.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.430
Oh, you're back.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.074
I didn't think
you'd be gone so long.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.475
Yeah, I just took
a walk around the cabin,

28:02.510 --> 28:04.944
took a couple of pictures.

28:04.980 --> 28:07.471
Mmm, what smells so good?

28:07.510 --> 28:12.789
A vegetable tagine
minus the actual tagine.

28:12.820 --> 28:13.980
And there's no lamb in it.

28:14.020 --> 28:15.487
I'm actually
using chickpeas.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.784
Oh, a night
in Tunisia.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.479
So exotic.

28:19.530 --> 28:22.920
Dammit, I forgot
the chickpeas.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.359
Oh, I can run
down to Seymour's.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.958
Are you okay?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.763
I mean, it's like
an hour there and back.

28:27.800 --> 28:28.892
Yeah, yeah.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.134
I actually wanted
to take some pictures

28:30.170 --> 28:31.307
of that covered
bridge on the way.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.466
Keys?

28:33.510 --> 28:35.000
By the door.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.177
Bye, babe.

28:54.330 --> 29:00.223
* We were dust in_ a world
of grim obsessmn *

29:04.140 --> 29:10.136
* We wouldn't _taunt_ from mouth
like an isolation *

29:13.280 --> 29:19.116
* We were pulled from our path
of least resistance *

29:23.220 --> 29:29.489
* And the songs we sang,
what became of us? *

29:42.110 --> 29:44.078
* We're here waiting for you

29:44.110 --> 29:48.069
* We are yours

29:48.120 --> 29:52.238
* We're waiting for you

29:53.320 --> 29:57.882
* We are yours

29:57.930 --> 30:02.196
* We're waiting for you

30:17.610 --> 30:19.441
I can't come
to you, okay?

30:19.480 --> 30:20.913
I'm at work.

30:20.950 --> 30:22.372
What time does
your meet start?

30:22.420 --> 30:23.375
Half an hour.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.387
Do you have it?

30:24.420 --> 30:26.115
It's money,
Shana,

30:26.150 --> 30:28.584
a lot, and
a piece of paper.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.087
You weren't
supposed to look.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.257
Well, I did.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.359
Where does it lead?

30:32.390 --> 30:33.425
Look, we don't
have time for this.

30:33.460 --> 30:36.122
Do you have a locker,
some place it will be safe?

30:38.470 --> 30:41.291
No, I mean we keep
our stuff under the counter.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.059
Don't just leave it sitting
around for someone to steal.

30:44.110 --> 30:47.159
Where am I supposed
to hide five grand?

30:47.210 --> 30:48.837
I'm gonna come by
after my meet.

31:19.140 --> 31:20.107
WOMAN: Excuse me?

31:20.140 --> 31:21.630
Hi.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.409
Hi.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.441
Refill?

31:26.180 --> 31:29.616
Hey, Mrs. Hastings,
is Spencer home?

31:29.650 --> 31:32.141
She's just not
answering her cell.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.543
Did she say
where she went?

31:36.090 --> 31:38.058
No, no, no,

31:38.090 --> 31:40.320
she just borrowed
some nail polish

31:40.360 --> 31:42.055
and I need it back.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.351
Could I stop by?

31:45.130 --> 31:46.119
Great.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.296
Thank you.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.687
( screaming )

32:11.730 --> 32:13.425
Thanks, Mrs. H.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.449
I'll just be a minute.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.668
Ezra in Ravenswood?

32:52.700 --> 32:54.338
Where are you going
with this, Spencer?

33:29.740 --> 33:30.764
WOMAN: ( on intercom )
Hello.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.234
Hi. I have
a flower delivery.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.687
Look, I don't
want to fight.
Are you on drugs?

33:47.390 --> 33:48.414
What?
No, I'm not.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.156
You've got to be on crack
if you think Ezra is "A."

33:52.730 --> 33:54.493
I went through
your computer.

33:54.530 --> 33:56.259
You should really
use a password

33:56.300 --> 33:57.597
if you want to keep
things private,

33:57.630 --> 34:00.269
especially when you're
following some crazy theory.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.291
Look, one of Alison's stories
kept on sticking in my brain

34:02.340 --> 34:03.796
and I finally
figured it out

34:03.840 --> 34:05.637
and I went to
"The Hart and Huntsman"

34:05.670 --> 34:07.809
and Ezra was there _
and he was eating the pie.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.875
Okay. You're
not making sense.

34:08.910 --> 34:11.708
The pie and the beer, Hanna,
from the story, okay.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.274
It's called
"Board Shorts Ale."

34:13.310 --> 34:15.278
And that's exactly what Fitz
ordered when he was there.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.275
And don't you get it?

34:16.320 --> 34:17.810
That's where Alison must
have got the nickname.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.341
Everything's all
jumbled up in Ali's stories.

34:20.390 --> 34:22.255
What if you're connecting
the wrong dots?

34:22.290 --> 34:23.314
Well, come inside.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.089
Either I prove it
or I'm wrong.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.722
( tires screeching )

34:29.160 --> 34:30.627
Are you coming?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.654
If Ezra comes home
and finds us here--

35:03.700 --> 35:05.167
I've been watching
the place all day.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.462
He hasn't been in or out.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.728
I think he must
be out of town.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.192
What are we even
looking for?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.662
Primarily, a key.
Move.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.674
I think Ezra may have rented
that apartment in Ravenswood.

35:15.710 --> 35:17.575
IfI can find something
that puts him there,

35:17.610 --> 35:19.601
I'll have proof.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.140
You're really serious
about this, aren't you?

35:23.920 --> 35:27.219
Wait, let's just say
that you're right.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.559
If there's anything that
ties him to Ravenswood,

35:29.590 --> 35:30.716
he's not keeping
it here.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.337
Walk away, Spencer.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.905
You know,
you're probably right.

35:44.940 --> 35:46.601
That was easy.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.403
I think
we're being watched.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.476
Don't look.

35:50.510 --> 35:52.705
Just follow my lead.

35:54.280 --> 35:57.909
Yeah, I have not been
sleeping well lately.

35:57.950 --> 36:00.441
With all this stuff
about Ezra in my head,

36:00.490 --> 36:01.650
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

36:20.740 --> 36:21.729
Ezra?

36:57.380 --> 36:58.677
Ezra?

37:10.660 --> 37:12.924
( gasps )

37:22.700 --> 37:23.359
Where were you
when I woke up?

37:26.440 --> 37:27.930
I forgot to lock
the back door.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.705
Were you up late reading?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.445
Yeah, yeah,
for a little bit.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.617
What's wrong?
Why couldn't you sleep?

37:38.650 --> 37:40.481
Are you worried
about us?

37:40.520 --> 37:42.681
_ I know that I was _
in a strange place earlier.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.621
And you were right
about this not working

37:45.660 --> 37:47.878
unless we tell the truth.

37:47.930 --> 37:52.697
Hey, are you okay?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.563
Yeah.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.866
I'm just really
glad you stayed.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.377
Me too.

38:04.410 --> 38:06.799
Wait. He has
a surveillance camera?

38:06.850 --> 38:08.772
What if the building
manager put it there?

38:08.820 --> 38:10.640
It was hidden.
And most honest people

38:10.680 --> 38:12.545
put up a sign saying
you're being recorded.

38:12.590 --> 38:14.387
Who else do we know
who likes to hide cameras

38:14.420 --> 38:15.557
and spy on people?

38:15.590 --> 38:16.818
But Mr. Fitz?

38:16.860 --> 38:18.487
Mr. Fitz isn't...

38:20.460 --> 38:21.950
You're saying that
you think he's "A"?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.798
I know. My head
feels like it's full
of hot ice cubes.

38:24.830 --> 38:27.424
I mean, he was so sweet to me
when my mom was in jail.

38:27.470 --> 38:29.665
He helped me
with my college essays.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.099
He was probably
trying to get close

38:31.140 --> 38:32.664
so we'd let our guard down.

38:32.710 --> 38:34.735
Have you called Aria?
We have to call Aria.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.077
No, not yet.

38:36.110 --> 38:38.647
I don't think we should tell
her until we're 100% sure.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.545
Well, she's in Syracuse
with her dad.

38:40.580 --> 38:41.945
So she's safe for now.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.345
Oh, thank God
you brought coffee.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.347
Here, do you want
me to make some?

38:44.390 --> 38:45.948
Yes, but not with that.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.389
That's for Shana.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.081
What does Shana want
with a bag of beans?

38:49.120 --> 38:50.758
And why are you still
talking to her?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.729
She needed me
to help her with this.

39:00.170 --> 39:01.728
Shana give you this?

39:03.140 --> 39:06.064
No.
It belongs to Alison.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.509
Shana was supposed
to meet me at the Brew,

39:07.540 --> 39:08.939
but she never
showed up.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.868
There's contact
information there,

39:10.910 --> 39:12.502
maybe for other people
who are helping her

39:12.550 --> 39:15.144
or places to stay.

39:15.180 --> 39:17.478
All I know is that Alison's
running out of money

39:17.520 --> 39:19.613
and Shana's the only one
who knows how to reach her.

39:19.650 --> 39:20.617
If she can't deliver it --

39:20.650 --> 39:22.686
Ali can't keep
on the move.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.153
And she's vulnerable.

39:24.190 --> 39:26.579
When was the last time
you talked With Shana?

39:26.630 --> 39:27.858
This afternoon.
Why?

39:27.890 --> 39:30.450
You said that Ezra
never came home today.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.718
Do you think he's got her?

39:32.770 --> 39:34.988
I think maybe he wants
Shana to lead him to Alison

39:35.040 --> 39:36.860
so he can finish
what he started.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.049
( cell phone ringing )

40:20.950 --> 40:22.474
Alison?

40:22.520 --> 40:24.681
Hi.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.439
Shana, do you have it?

40:27.490 --> 40:29.151
I was...

40:29.190 --> 40:30.157
I'm...

40:30.190 --> 40:32.055
Shana, do you have it?

40:32.090 --> 40:34.558
Do you have the money?

40:34.600 --> 40:35.726
Shana?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.990
I don't...
I'm not sure where I am.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.137
Shana?
I have to hang up now.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.542
What do you mean?

40:53.580 --> 40:54.649
I'm sorry I have to go.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.216
Shana, what happened
to the money?

40:56.250 --> 40:57.649
I don't have it.

41:00.520 --> 41:01.953
What am I supposed to do?

41:01.990 --> 41:03.651
I have to go.

41:13.870 --> 41:18.739
* When was it
made to live alone-- *

41:22.210 --> 41:25.805
* That's why I have my

41:30.220 --> 41:36.557
* Whenever
I close my eyes *

41:36.590 --> 41:38.751
* All I can see

42:16.960 --> 42:19.224
Maybe you did it,
maybe you didn't.

42:24.300 --> 42:30.307
Sam says you didn't kill her,
and I've known Sam a long time.

42:30.340 --> 42:34.572
I've got a lot of faith in Sam.
That's why I took this job.

42:34.620 --> 42:37.646
IfI had thought you were
a professional killer,

42:37.680 --> 42:39.238
I wouldn't have
any part of it.
