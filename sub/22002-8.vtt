WEBVTT

00:00.508 --> 00:01.541
Hey, Jake,

00:01.576 --> 00:02.842
guess who just called me?

00:02.877 --> 00:04.588
The Jerky Boys. They're back!

00:04.594 --> 00:05.794
No. What?

00:05.829 --> 00:07.031
- No.
- No.

00:07.055 --> 00:09.915
D.C. Parlov. He's in town for LegendCon,

00:09.921 --> 00:11.024
and he has a case for us!

00:11.050 --> 00:13.051
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

00:13.066 --> 00:14.880
Parlov? Didn't he write
those "Skyfire" books?

00:14.886 --> 00:16.184
I thought he turned out to be a jerk.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.540
Yeah, but ever since Jake
and I saved his life,

00:18.546 --> 00:20.405
he's actually been very nice.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.873
He even sent me a Christmas gift.

00:21.908 --> 00:25.442
A full-scale replica of
the sword of Opadoma.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.126
- Unh!
- Why are you so excited?

00:27.161 --> 00:28.431
You don't care about those stupid books.

00:28.437 --> 00:30.356
I actually did read all
of them in prison.

00:30.362 --> 00:31.581
They are the greatest books I've

00:31.587 --> 00:33.016
ever read, and I've read "Cujo."

00:33.022 --> 00:35.330
Jake and I really bonded over "Skyfire."

00:35.336 --> 00:36.668
- Yeah.
- Watch this.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.079
Favorite moment in the series?

00:38.085 --> 00:40.105
The summoning of Balacastro.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.630
- Second favorite?
- The Scarlet Feast!

00:42.636 --> 00:44.777
- Third favorite?
- When you thought Ka'lar

00:44.812 --> 00:46.311
had been swallowed by the Norolith,

00:46.347 --> 00:47.846
but had just switched armor

00:47.882 --> 00:49.448
with Samling the Betrayer

00:49.483 --> 00:51.150
in the battle of Vorcastle.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.618
Fourth favorite?

00:52.644 --> 00:54.305
Three was plenty. So was zero.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.297
Okay, I can see that
you're skeptical, Rosa,

00:56.303 --> 00:58.615
but how about this: come
with us on the case!

00:58.621 --> 01:00.688
I know you think it's dumb,
but "Skyfire" is actually

01:00.694 --> 01:02.661
very smart and dark and adult.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.029
It's not for nerds at all.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.431
Ooh! On our way there,

01:05.465 --> 01:06.809
should we sing the elvish hunting song?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.268
♪ Sharpen your swords ♪

01:09.303 --> 01:10.569
♪ And string your bows ♪

01:10.604 --> 01:12.104

Whoa, look at this place!

01:34.395 --> 01:36.628
Ooh, they're selling moss wine.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.064
I wonder if it's as gross
as the books say it is.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.732
I can never get into any of this crap.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.534
I think the reason is
because it's garbage.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.169
Rosa, I think if you
just gave it a chance,

01:44.205 --> 01:46.127
you would get hooked.
I mean, what is it that

01:46.133 --> 01:47.845
you do in your free time that's so cool?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.641
Fix up old cars and sell
them to celebrities.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.343
That's why I'm friends with Tom Hardy.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.144
Right, so we agree that
we're all equally cool.

01:53.150 --> 01:54.680
Here we go. This is Parlov's panel.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.582
"Diversity in Fantasy Writing."

01:56.617 --> 01:58.350
Ooh, the line starts here.

02:00.056 --> 02:01.789
Real diverse diversity panel.

02:01.795 --> 02:03.595
And, like, people always ask me,

02:03.601 --> 02:04.900
"Where do you get your ideas?"

02:04.936 --> 02:06.969
And honestly, Wikipedia.

02:07.004 --> 02:08.561
I always try to pull from life.

02:08.567 --> 02:10.406
Queen Tiffany, of
course, was named after

02:10.441 --> 02:11.674
a lovely hostess that I met

02:11.709 --> 02:13.324
in Bonita Springs in Florida.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.611
You know, I've always wanted
to write a book myself,

02:15.646 --> 02:17.813
but all I know about is cops,
and there are literally

02:17.849 --> 02:19.340
no more cop stories to tell. Zero.

02:19.346 --> 02:21.495
- I've actually been writing a novel.
- Wait, what?

02:21.501 --> 02:23.511
You're writing a book? When? For who?

02:23.517 --> 02:24.987
For me... for fun.

02:25.022 --> 02:26.589
Look, I'm not trying to be an author.

02:26.597 --> 02:28.163
I don't even know how
to go about doing that.

02:28.199 --> 02:30.165
Parlov! You should show it to Parlov.

02:30.201 --> 02:33.235
- He could probably get it published.
- No, that's crazy.

02:33.271 --> 02:35.690
Like, I'm sure it's bad. I
don't want to be embarrassed.

02:35.696 --> 02:37.573
Terry, you are a great husband,

02:37.608 --> 02:39.441
father, detective, painter, dancer,

02:39.477 --> 02:41.333
and you're so jacked you
have muscles on your back.

02:41.339 --> 02:42.792
Everyone has back muscles, Jake.

02:42.798 --> 02:44.747
Nuh-huh, my back looks like
the inside of a spoon.

02:44.782 --> 02:46.415
The point is, you're
great at everything.

02:46.450 --> 02:47.850
You're probably great at writing, too.

02:47.885 --> 02:49.585
I am not showing Parlov my book, okay?

02:49.620 --> 02:51.083
All right.

02:51.645 --> 02:53.682
Here he comes. Now just drop it.

02:54.409 --> 02:56.872
Sorry, I hope that wasn't
too tedious for you.

02:56.878 --> 02:59.050
It was fascinating, especially to Terry.

02:59.056 --> 03:00.805
- He's a writer, and he wrote a book.
- Would you read it?

03:00.811 --> 03:03.201
- Dude!
- Sure. Love to, absolutely.

03:03.207 --> 03:04.868
But listen, there's something
I want you to see.

03:04.874 --> 03:06.407
Come with me, guys, all right?

03:06.442 --> 03:07.808
- Jake!
- What?

03:07.889 --> 03:09.689
Terry, you need to believe in yourself,

03:09.724 --> 03:11.958
like when Morzak answered
the sorceress' riddle!

03:11.993 --> 03:13.393
She turned him into a tree, Jake.

03:13.428 --> 03:16.016
Yeah, a tree that became
the handle of Prominius' axe.

03:16.022 --> 03:17.616
Parlov is so far away already.

03:17.622 --> 03:19.221
Yeah, good call. Let's go after him.

03:19.227 --> 03:20.626
Hey.

03:20.632 --> 03:21.832
The desk sergeant said we're hosting

03:21.838 --> 03:23.380
a forensic sciences course.

03:23.386 --> 03:25.853
Yes, taught by Dr. Ronald Yee.

03:26.007 --> 03:28.842
He revolutionized the field
of forensic entomology.

03:28.877 --> 03:30.178
He is a rock star.

03:30.184 --> 03:32.051
Oh, please. Rock stars
wish they were he.

03:32.057 --> 03:34.109
The man can tell how long a
corpse had been decomposing

03:34.115 --> 03:36.082
just by studying the maggots inside.

03:36.117 --> 03:37.584
I'd like to see Barbra
Streisand do that.

03:37.619 --> 03:39.825
I'm not sure Barbra Streisand
counts as a rock star, sir.

03:39.831 --> 03:41.675
She sings in English. That's rock music.

03:41.681 --> 03:44.382
Well, it sounds interesting.
Can I sign up?

03:44.860 --> 03:47.360
Yes, you can,

03:47.395 --> 03:49.729
but here's the thing: if
we do well at this course,

03:49.764 --> 03:51.464
we receive board certification,

03:51.500 --> 03:53.633
which makes us eligible
to receive a grant

03:53.668 --> 03:55.735
to open a field lab in the precinct,

03:55.770 --> 03:57.604
but...

03:57.639 --> 04:00.940
Eh... but whenever we
have a speaker come in,

04:00.976 --> 04:02.976
you kind of tend to always

04:03.011 --> 04:05.378
derail these things
with personal stories.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.779
That's how I learn.
I relate course material

04:06.815 --> 04:08.047
to my experiences.

04:08.083 --> 04:09.749
Subjective learning.

04:09.784 --> 04:11.069
Millennials.

04:11.075 --> 04:12.519
I know it's important, so I promise,

04:12.554 --> 04:13.920
I won't tell any stories,

04:13.955 --> 04:15.655
though sometimes they do come in handy.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.423
One time, all the Boyles were in

04:17.459 --> 04:19.291
this fungus cavern, and this
massive mushroom comes...

04:19.327 --> 04:20.760
- Charles.
- I am so sorry.

04:20.795 --> 04:22.674
I slipped right into it. I'll be good.

04:23.365 --> 04:24.998
This is my room, right over here.

04:25.033 --> 04:26.633
Listen, I need just a
moment to clean up.

04:26.668 --> 04:28.735
I had a female visitor in earlier today

04:28.770 --> 04:30.003
dressed as Concubina.

04:30.038 --> 04:33.159
She got smears of green body
paint all over everything.

04:33.475 --> 04:35.475
Everything.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.745
He was talking about his penis.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.313
- I know, Jake.
- He pulls, Rosa.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.875
- He pulls. That's all I'm saying.
- I can't believe you

04:41.881 --> 04:44.851
- told him about my book.
- I'm sorry, Terry, but now

04:44.886 --> 04:47.654
D.C. Parlov is going to read what
you wrote! How cool is that?

04:47.689 --> 04:49.088
- He's pretty cool.
- Right?

04:49.124 --> 04:50.857
You haven't even told
me what it's about yet.

04:50.892 --> 04:52.333
Well, it's the story
of a Gorgon warrior...

04:52.339 --> 04:54.124
- Awesome.
- Who betrays his bloodline...

04:54.130 --> 04:55.617
- How could he?
- To marry a Cloud Princess...

04:55.623 --> 04:57.046
- He did it for love.
- Even though

04:57.052 --> 04:58.383
- their families are at war.
- No! All right,

04:58.389 --> 05:00.278
no more spoilers. Send it over to me,

05:00.284 --> 05:01.578
and I'm gonna stay up
all night reading it.

05:01.584 --> 05:03.407
- It's only 150 pages.
- I'm gonna stay up

05:03.413 --> 05:04.779
all the next three nights reading it.

05:05.006 --> 05:06.639
Dr. Yee will be here any minute,

05:06.675 --> 05:08.363
and we need to make a good impression.

05:08.369 --> 05:09.976
If you need to cough...

05:10.011 --> 05:11.444
Cough now.

05:13.081 --> 05:15.048
My God, what if I hadn't said anything?

05:15.083 --> 05:16.516
Don't worry, I got this.

05:16.551 --> 05:17.984
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.

05:18.019 --> 05:19.652
Our scoliosis allows us

05:19.688 --> 05:21.352
to bow more deeply than normal people.

05:21.358 --> 05:23.886
Huh, here's an idea: Santiago
and I will impress him

05:23.892 --> 05:25.700
with the depth of our
forensic knowledge,

05:25.706 --> 05:27.660
and you can wow him

05:27.696 --> 05:30.330
with your stoic, silent demeanor.

05:30.365 --> 05:32.276
No stories. Understood?

05:32.282 --> 05:33.454
Stoic. Ah.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.954
Good morning, everyone.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.803
Thank you for having
me at the Nine-Nine.

05:36.838 --> 05:38.471
Sorry I'm late. Just had to deal

05:38.506 --> 05:39.906
with some family issues.

05:39.941 --> 05:42.075
Cousins, right?

05:42.110 --> 05:43.776
Okay, before we get technical,

05:43.812 --> 05:45.378
let's talk a bit about
the history of blood.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.413
Does anyone here know any hemophiliacs?

05:47.449 --> 05:48.648
So many...

05:48.683 --> 05:50.316
Now, they played a vital role

05:50.352 --> 05:51.551
in the development of modern forensics.

05:51.586 --> 05:53.453
Them and leeches.

05:53.488 --> 05:54.887
My cousin Torvald is a hemophiliac,

05:54.923 --> 05:56.689
and his wife is a leech farmer.

05:56.725 --> 05:58.591
I say "wife," but it's
a common-law marriage.

05:58.627 --> 06:00.059
For the longest time,
Boyle wedding ceremonies

06:00.095 --> 06:01.461
were not recognized in the state.

06:01.496 --> 06:03.529
- _
- Well, here's the situation:

06:03.565 --> 06:04.931
somebody stole my laptop,

06:04.966 --> 06:06.833
which contained the
unpublished manuscript

06:06.868 --> 06:08.968
of book 13 of "The Skyfire Cycle."

06:09.757 --> 06:11.804
The person left this note.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.506
"We have your book.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.708
"Pay us $500,000 in the next 24 hours

06:15.744 --> 06:17.410
"or we leak it online.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.045
"The first five chapters are now up."

06:19.080 --> 06:20.980
They've been downloaded 85,000 times.

06:21.016 --> 06:23.101
Well, we should probably
go online and read those

06:23.107 --> 06:25.023
chapters in case there's
some clues in there,

06:25.053 --> 06:27.687
and also maybe we'll find out
Qwandor's true parentage?

06:27.722 --> 06:30.246
- Oh that's already been revealed.
- No, it hasn't.

06:30.252 --> 06:31.724
Unless the prophecy of Dorgon

06:31.760 --> 06:33.059
is indeed true!

06:33.094 --> 06:35.795
- But that would mean...
- You seem pretty calm for somebody

06:35.830 --> 06:38.036
- whose book was just stolen.
- Because I know who took it.

06:38.042 --> 06:40.657
- Landon Lawson.
- He was on that panel. He writes

06:40.663 --> 06:42.530
"The Shadowbringer Saga." It's garbage.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.820
So why would Lawson want
to steal your manuscript?

06:44.826 --> 06:46.372
We both have books coming out this fall,

06:46.408 --> 06:47.534
and we have a rather public bet

06:47.540 --> 06:48.915
about whose is going to sell better.

06:48.921 --> 06:50.973
I believe he's leaking
my manuscript online

06:50.979 --> 06:52.812
just to hurt my sales.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.547
- You should arrest him.
- Well, we're not going to

06:54.582 --> 06:56.015
do anything until we've
seen all the evidence.

06:56.051 --> 06:57.383
If this book fails,

06:57.419 --> 06:58.851
that's the end of "Skyfire."

06:58.887 --> 07:01.454
Let's go take this son of a bitch down!

07:02.263 --> 07:03.882
Mr. Lawson? NYPD.

07:03.888 --> 07:06.535
Let me guess: you're here
about the stolen manuscript?

07:06.541 --> 07:09.332
So you admit you did it?
Well, that was easy.

07:09.371 --> 07:11.953
What? No. Someone stole my manuscript,

07:11.959 --> 07:13.545
and I know who it was:

07:13.768 --> 07:15.768
D.C. Parlov.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.835
By Zorton's Sword!

07:18.117 --> 07:20.544
It's the exact same note Parlov got.

07:20.550 --> 07:22.738
I don't see why anybody would
want to steal your book.

07:22.744 --> 07:25.259
"The Skyfire Cycle" makes
"The Shadowbringer Saga"

07:25.265 --> 07:26.797
look like "The BeastWorm Chronicles."

07:26.833 --> 07:28.267
You see, Rosa, "The
BeastWorm Chronicles"

07:28.273 --> 07:29.585
are one of the more simplistic...

07:29.591 --> 07:30.619
- Don't care.
- Yeah.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.950
You know what? My books
say something, okay?

07:32.966 --> 07:35.522
I was the only one brave enough
to tackle elf molestation.

07:35.528 --> 07:37.995
Guys, calm down. You're both victims.

07:38.030 --> 07:39.935
Now, do you have any enemies in common?

07:39.941 --> 07:42.229
Let me think about that.
Parlov is my enemy,

07:42.235 --> 07:43.835
but he's also his own enemy,

07:43.870 --> 07:45.737
because he's such a boring
and repetitive writer.

07:45.772 --> 07:47.505
He just keeps killing off characters,

07:47.540 --> 07:49.240
resurrecting them, and
killing 'em off again.

07:49.246 --> 07:50.541
Because of the Chrysalis Orb!

07:50.577 --> 07:51.676
Uh, sorry.

07:51.711 --> 07:53.164
Police officer, on a case.

07:53.170 --> 07:54.734
But we will need you to
both generate actual

07:54.740 --> 07:56.303
lists of people that
might want to hurt you.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.675
We have 24 hours to
figure this out, but if

07:57.681 --> 07:59.326
we don't, are you willing
to pay the ransom?

07:59.332 --> 08:00.931
I'd do anything to get my book back.

08:00.937 --> 08:02.770
I mean, you understand. You're a writer.

08:02.776 --> 08:04.943
Do you hear that, Terry?
He called you a writer.

08:05.558 --> 08:07.465
Terry, did you hear? Terry?

08:07.471 --> 08:08.688
Well, Terry's broken.

08:08.694 --> 08:10.195
Write up those lists. We're on the case.

08:10.201 --> 08:12.562
- _
- Welcome back.

08:12.599 --> 08:13.831
So today, I want to focus on

08:13.867 --> 08:15.767
facial reconstruction.

08:15.802 --> 08:17.602
For over a century,
we used plaster casts

08:17.637 --> 08:20.238
to help identify decomposed
John and Jane Does.

08:20.273 --> 08:22.707
We buried my Nana Boyle
at the family farm,

08:22.742 --> 08:24.742
but because of the soil's
high salt content,

08:24.778 --> 08:26.465
she turned into jerky. Never mind.

08:26.471 --> 08:28.835
- Please continue.
- Now, I need one person per group

08:28.841 --> 08:30.748
to have a plaster cast
made of their head.

08:30.784 --> 08:32.756
Uh, will he... or she...

08:32.763 --> 08:34.157
Be able to speak?

08:34.163 --> 08:35.553
Not while the plaster's on, no.

08:35.587 --> 08:36.721
- I vote Charles.
- Charles.

08:36.748 --> 08:38.077
I was gonna vote me, too.

08:38.091 --> 08:40.258
I mean, I know the plaster
can dry out your skin,

08:40.293 --> 08:41.859
but as a Boyle, I'm aggressively moist.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.462
Oop, you gotta close that mouth, Boyle.

08:44.497 --> 08:46.057
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

08:46.063 --> 08:48.564
Keep still and quiet.

08:50.236 --> 08:51.736
Have you been here all night?

08:51.771 --> 08:53.638
We traded off, and
each slept a few hours

08:53.673 --> 08:56.207
right here in the break
room, but we got a lead.

08:56.242 --> 08:57.642
You know Miles Moorgil?

08:57.677 --> 08:59.711
He wrote "The Nocturine Quartet" novels.

08:59.746 --> 09:01.713
Well, Moorgil is the only person

09:01.748 --> 09:05.089
on both Parlov and Lawson's
lists of potential enemies.

09:05.418 --> 09:07.618
Apparently, they each
slept with his wife.

09:07.654 --> 09:09.677
How do these guys do so well with women?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.483
Oh, I'm sorry they don't live up to

09:11.489 --> 09:13.291
your superficial standards
of male beauty, Rosa.

09:13.326 --> 09:14.726
I'm kidding. It's because they're rich.

09:14.761 --> 09:16.594
Moorgil's here for the conference.

09:16.629 --> 09:19.079
We're gonna go confront him
and get the laptops back.

09:19.085 --> 09:20.798
Then, maybe, we can see if

09:20.834 --> 09:22.600
Parlov read my book yet.

09:22.635 --> 09:24.635
Oh, well, I mean, it's
been less than a day.

09:24.671 --> 09:26.404
- Maybe don't get your hopes up.
- Don't worry.

09:26.439 --> 09:27.839
I don't have any expectations.

09:27.874 --> 09:29.607
- Good.
- I'm gonna be at my phone,

09:29.642 --> 09:32.243
just in case a publisher calls.
I mean, someone.

09:32.278 --> 09:33.811
Yeah. Whatever.

09:33.847 --> 09:35.480
It's fine. My hopes are up.

09:35.515 --> 09:37.482
All right, buddy.

09:37.517 --> 09:39.183
I couldn't sleep last
night, so I started

09:39.219 --> 09:41.152
reading Terry's book, and it's terrible.

09:41.187 --> 09:43.321
I made him show it to Parlov.
He's gonna be humiliated.

09:43.356 --> 09:44.889
Relax. How bad could it be?

09:44.924 --> 09:46.791
So bad, and I'm entertained
by everything.

09:46.826 --> 09:48.240
I once went to a play.

09:48.246 --> 09:49.527
So what are you gonna do about Parlov?

09:49.562 --> 09:51.162
- I don't know.
- Don't know what?

09:51.197 --> 09:52.330
Uh, how to do...

09:52.365 --> 09:53.878
Sex... good.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.900
How much should I be
flapping my arms around?

09:55.935 --> 09:56.973
- Not much.
- Right.

09:56.979 --> 09:58.569
Well, that settles that.

09:58.605 --> 10:00.538
I knew that Amy was wrong.

10:00.573 --> 10:02.206
Anyways, let's get back
on the case, right?

10:02.242 --> 10:03.839
Skyfire Cycle.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.477
Okay, now that the plaster's dry,

10:06.513 --> 10:08.081
you'll see why we lubricated the

10:08.087 --> 10:09.899
subject's face with Vaseline first.

10:10.048 --> 10:12.315
Oh, no, we forgot the lube.

10:12.952 --> 10:14.867
Charles, can you hear us?

10:15.210 --> 10:17.373
What do we do?

10:17.690 --> 10:19.557
Doctor? Uh, what if someone...

10:19.592 --> 10:21.392
No one in this room, mind you...

10:21.428 --> 10:23.537
Forgot to lubricate before
applying the plaster?

10:23.543 --> 10:25.797
Oh, one of my lab techs
made that mistake once.

10:25.832 --> 10:27.665
It becomes impossible to remove the mask

10:27.700 --> 10:29.500
without literally skinning
the subject alive.

10:29.536 --> 10:31.067
It takes five days for the plaster

10:31.073 --> 10:32.294
to slough off on its own.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.720
And what became of the lab tech?

10:33.726 --> 10:35.014
Oh, I fired him. It was an

10:35.020 --> 10:36.547
unacceptable level of incompetence.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.943
Huh, what a satisfying
conclusion to that story.

10:38.978 --> 10:40.178
- Boyle!
- Mm.

10:40.213 --> 10:41.370
A mistake was made and we

10:41.376 --> 10:42.712
can't remove your mask yet.

10:42.718 --> 10:44.348
We're gonna leave you in here...

10:44.384 --> 10:45.817
Until after the class is over,

10:45.852 --> 10:47.585
because if Dr. Yee sees you like this,

10:47.620 --> 10:49.754
we can kiss our certification good-bye.

10:50.924 --> 10:52.256
I'm sorry, Boyle,

10:52.292 --> 10:53.458
but Hitchcock and Scully

10:53.493 --> 10:54.692
will be here with you.

10:57.315 --> 10:58.863
I don't know, Captain.
He seems pretty upset.

10:58.898 --> 11:00.731
- Hold on.
- Mm!

11:03.803 --> 11:05.503
Look how happy he is now.

11:07.307 --> 11:08.739
Yes, you're welcome, Boyle.

11:08.775 --> 11:10.374
I don't understand.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.410
Why do you think I would
steal those laptops?

11:12.445 --> 11:14.378
Parlov and Lawson are your rivals.

11:14.414 --> 11:15.880
You're jealous of their success.

11:15.915 --> 11:17.648
And of course, you have
a personal motive.

11:17.684 --> 11:19.892
You hate them for
sleeping with your wife.

11:19.898 --> 11:22.588
- What? They slept with my wife?
- And you didn't know.

11:23.625 --> 11:25.356
Well, this is awkward. We
should probably just go.

11:25.391 --> 11:26.657
- Jessica!
- She's here.

11:26.693 --> 11:28.459
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, sweets?

11:28.495 --> 11:29.931
Did you sleep with D.C.

11:29.937 --> 11:31.623
Parlov and Landon Lawson?

11:32.398 --> 11:34.332
- Uh...
- Why would you do that?

11:34.367 --> 11:36.208
You've ruined our marriage.
You've ruined it!

11:36.214 --> 11:37.337
You know, this seems like a

11:37.343 --> 11:38.674
conversation for just you two,

11:38.705 --> 11:40.238
so... oop, here comes a child.

11:40.273 --> 11:41.519
Mommy? Daddy?

11:41.525 --> 11:43.341
Are you getting divorced?

11:43.563 --> 11:44.996
Are they getting divorced?

11:45.232 --> 11:47.512
Uh...

11:47.547 --> 11:48.913
Oof.

11:48.948 --> 11:50.281
Okay, that was a rough 70 minutes.

11:50.316 --> 11:52.717
- Yeah, but...
- That kid looked exactly like Parlov?

11:52.752 --> 11:53.784
100%.

11:53.820 --> 11:55.386
Oh...

11:55.421 --> 11:57.321
Anyways, that was our last lead,

11:57.357 --> 11:59.757
so looks like we're back
at the Nil Caverns.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.810
- Did you just say the Nil Caverns?
- Hm?

12:02.816 --> 12:04.923
- Like, from my book?
- Uh, yep.

12:04.929 --> 12:06.140
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I did,

12:06.146 --> 12:07.436
because you told me about them

12:07.467 --> 12:08.863
when you were explaining the plot.

12:08.869 --> 12:10.501
I didn't, but that's because I wanted

12:10.507 --> 12:12.050
the Nil Caverns to be a surprise.

12:12.705 --> 12:14.639
Why didn't you tell me
you read my book, Jake?

12:14.674 --> 12:16.173
- Uh...
- Oh, no.

12:16.209 --> 12:17.341
- You hated it.
- What?

12:17.377 --> 12:19.877
Terry, no, I didn't hate it.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.306
- I liked tons of parts.
- Name one.

12:22.312 --> 12:24.749
Name one part you liked, Jake.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.218
- The map?
- I didn't draw that!

12:27.253 --> 12:28.653
It was a map of the Chesapeake Bay

12:28.688 --> 12:30.288
with the names slightly changed!

12:30.323 --> 12:32.790
Oh, my God.

12:32.825 --> 12:34.692
You made me show Parlov.

12:34.727 --> 12:37.543
You humiliated me in front of my hero!

12:38.298 --> 12:40.264
Sarge, I'm sorry.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.499
Look, I didn't just like the map.

12:41.534 --> 12:42.800
I also liked...

12:42.835 --> 12:44.454
the spaces between the words!

12:44.460 --> 12:45.759
That's not helpful.

12:47.209 --> 12:48.636
You guys got a million dollars

12:48.642 --> 12:50.115
together on 24 hours' notice?

12:50.146 --> 12:52.035
Yeah, I had to liquidate my Bitcoins.

12:52.041 --> 12:53.380
Oh, really?

12:53.416 --> 12:55.053
I would've thought you'd
be flushed with cash

12:55.059 --> 12:56.904
from the "Skyfire" TV series.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.075
Oh, wait, that's right.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.544
The CW passed.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.479
How's the "Shadowbringer"
film coming along?

13:01.514 --> 13:03.381
Howie Long still playing both twins?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.800
All right. Let's go over the plan.

13:04.806 --> 13:07.318
Okay, there's a potted tree on
the east side of the lobby.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.120
They said to leave the
briefcase behind that.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.055
If someone grabs it,
Rosa, Peralta, and I

13:11.090 --> 13:12.490
will converge. We'll be positioned

13:12.525 --> 13:14.103
around the room in disguise.

13:14.109 --> 13:16.059
It's not gonna work. I
don't own a nerd costume.

13:16.065 --> 13:19.205
Oh, but Rosa, you are
already wearing one.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.812
You naturally dress like
the female bounty hunter

13:21.818 --> 13:23.531
in every steampunk novel.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.172
Look. All you need are welding goggles.

13:27.178 --> 13:28.474
Damn it.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.074
I have welding goggles in the car.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.109
Shall we to battle?

13:41.254 --> 13:42.940
To solve that problem, we would

13:42.946 --> 13:44.522
use fluid dynamic analysis.

13:44.528 --> 13:47.262
That is exactly right. Well done.

13:47.501 --> 13:48.900
Where's your friend?

13:48.906 --> 13:50.384
Shouldn't he be here for
the plaster removal?

13:50.390 --> 13:52.422
Something came up, so he
had to remove the mask,

13:52.428 --> 13:54.895
which came off quite
easily, and run out.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.334
It was urgent police business.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.902
Bunch of kids are being held hostage,

13:57.937 --> 13:59.136
so he had to go deal with that.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.223
Oh, well, if you need to leave
to provide him with backup...

14:01.229 --> 14:02.659
- No, it's a teachable moment.
- The children

14:02.665 --> 14:04.225
- can handle themselves.
- Captain Holt?

14:04.249 --> 14:05.590
Your husband's on the phone.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.128
He wants to know how long

14:07.164 --> 14:09.008
you're going to kiss for tonight?

14:09.666 --> 14:12.148
Would you excuse us for one moment?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.461
Your husband didn't really call.

14:14.467 --> 14:15.900
I wasn't sure what gay guys talk about

14:15.906 --> 14:17.320
on the phone. How'd I do?

14:17.326 --> 14:18.895
Scully, what do you want?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.472
We were watching Charles, like you said,

14:20.478 --> 14:22.859
but both of us had to go to
the bathroom really bad.

14:22.865 --> 14:24.431
Ugh. Where's Charles?

14:24.466 --> 14:26.363
- We have no idea.
- What?

14:26.492 --> 14:28.339
- Terry, do you copy?
- I copy.

14:28.345 --> 14:31.090
- Seriously? You're still mad at me?
- All I said was "I copy."

14:31.096 --> 14:33.315
Yeah, but you had a tone. Just admit it.

14:33.321 --> 14:35.138
- Let it go, Jake.
- No, he's right.

14:35.144 --> 14:36.258
Terry had a tone.

14:36.264 --> 14:38.512
- Terry had a big-time tone.
- Don't worry.

14:38.547 --> 14:40.013
I bet he hasn't even read your book yet.

14:40.049 --> 14:42.104
It's been two hours. I'm almost
at the front of this line.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.308
I don't even know who I'm
waiting to take a picture with.

14:44.356 --> 14:46.222
"Bran Stark?" Pass.

14:46.228 --> 14:49.129
Okay, he's just the three-eyed raven.

14:49.135 --> 14:50.935
Here we go, here we go. We got action.

14:50.941 --> 14:52.841
He dresses just like you, Jake.
Is that someone popular?

14:52.847 --> 14:54.653
Yes, Rosa, it's Ka'lar.

14:54.688 --> 14:57.055
17th of his name, sworn
knight of the Queen's Crown,

14:57.091 --> 14:58.536
the Daybreaker, the rightful heir to...

14:58.542 --> 15:00.269
All right. You can just say "Ka'lar."

15:00.275 --> 15:02.290
Uh, then how will you know which
Ka'lar I'm talking about?

15:02.296 --> 15:03.628
It's a very common name in "Skyfire."

15:03.664 --> 15:05.097
It's like their John.

15:05.132 --> 15:07.099
He's going for the briefcase.

15:07.134 --> 15:08.715
Okay, let's go.

15:08.721 --> 15:10.168
Don't make your move
until you're close to him.

15:10.204 --> 15:11.970
There's too many civilians.

15:14.308 --> 15:16.908
Wait, why are there so many Ka'lars?

15:16.944 --> 15:18.503
Costume contest just ended.

15:18.509 --> 15:20.712
That's why he waited until
now to pick up the money.

15:20.747 --> 15:22.314
I lost him. Which one is it?

15:22.349 --> 15:23.748
It's the one headed toward
the service elevator.

15:23.784 --> 15:25.050
Hey! Freeze!

15:25.085 --> 15:26.490
NYPD. Let me see your hands.

15:26.496 --> 15:28.086
What's going on?

15:28.122 --> 15:30.594
Doesn't have the briefcase.
I got the wrong Ka'lar.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.224
- I have eyes on him.
- Take him down!

15:34.094 --> 15:36.785
Wrong Ka'lar...

15:37.264 --> 15:39.631
Boyle's not in the interrogation room.

15:39.666 --> 15:41.266
He couldn't have gotten far.
He can't see.

15:41.301 --> 15:43.201
You can go a long way
on muscle memory alone.

15:43.237 --> 15:44.803
One time, I sleepwalked

15:44.838 --> 15:47.213
- to the M&M's store in Times Square.
- Oh, oh!

15:47.219 --> 15:49.016
Stairwell.

15:49.526 --> 15:51.593
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- I'm okay.

15:51.745 --> 15:54.045
It's okay. Sorry, stranger.

15:54.081 --> 15:55.680
I just can't see anything at all,

15:55.716 --> 15:57.616
and it's really scary being touched.

15:57.651 --> 15:59.117
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

15:59.153 --> 16:00.752
Just return me to the 99th precinct.

16:00.787 --> 16:02.287
Boyle, it's us.

16:02.322 --> 16:04.156
Where were you going?
Why would you leave

16:04.191 --> 16:05.924
that windowless supply
closet we locked you in?

16:05.959 --> 16:08.193
Ah, yes, hearing it, I understand why.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.828
I was trying to get to the locker room

16:09.863 --> 16:11.229
to steam the mask off in the shower

16:11.265 --> 16:13.298
so you guys could still get certified.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.475
Wait.

16:14.481 --> 16:16.415
You were trying to help us?

16:16.421 --> 16:18.303
Even though you'll be stuck
in this mask for five days?

16:18.338 --> 16:19.792
Five days?

16:19.847 --> 16:21.935
Well, I know how important
the course was to you.

16:22.276 --> 16:23.975
It's not.

16:24.011 --> 16:26.077
Not anymore.

16:26.113 --> 16:27.779
I'm so sorry.

16:27.814 --> 16:30.215
I just cannot see at all.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.616
I can't believe it!

16:31.652 --> 16:33.718
Now I'm out $1/2 million!

16:33.754 --> 16:35.187
What am I supposed to do now?

16:35.222 --> 16:37.022
Write another "Compendium of Beasts"?

16:37.057 --> 16:38.890
Do you have any idea how hard it is

16:38.926 --> 16:42.594
to find enough interns to
slap that crap together?

16:42.629 --> 16:43.806
God!

16:43.812 --> 16:45.096
Don't worry about him.

16:45.132 --> 16:46.998
At least we got to stop that thief

16:47.034 --> 16:48.833
from releasing any more chapters.

16:48.869 --> 16:50.369
All we're out is some
money, plus I've got

16:50.375 --> 16:51.908
insurance, so I'm going
to get it all back.

16:51.939 --> 16:53.198
By the way, Detective Jeffords,

16:53.204 --> 16:54.353
while we were waiting,

16:54.359 --> 16:56.007
I had an opportunity to
read your manuscript.

16:56.043 --> 16:58.043
Oh, don't worry about that.

16:58.078 --> 16:59.878
It's a work in progress.

16:59.913 --> 17:01.279
Has a lot of changes I...

17:01.315 --> 17:03.048
No, no, no, it was great. Truly.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.150
Fantastic. I mean, it
was so fresh, you know?

17:05.185 --> 17:07.051
It had a really unique point of view.

17:07.087 --> 17:08.752
I sent it on to my publishers.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.528
Thank you for allowing me to read it.

17:10.534 --> 17:11.756
And I want to thank you all

17:11.791 --> 17:13.724
for your hard, hard work on this case.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.126
Appreciate it.

17:16.730 --> 17:18.230
Ooh, did you hear that?

17:18.265 --> 17:19.631
He loved it.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.032
D.C. Parlov loved my writing!

17:22.069 --> 17:23.635
You were wrong!

17:23.670 --> 17:25.637
And being wrong never felt so right.

17:25.672 --> 17:27.800
Oh, that sounded cool. Did
I just make up a hit song?

17:27.807 --> 17:29.908
♪ Being wrong never felt so right ♪

17:29.943 --> 17:32.077
♪ With the Addams Family
staying up all night ♪

17:32.112 --> 17:33.645
Yep, I was right. It's a hit.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.976
I gotta go call Sharon!

17:34.982 --> 17:37.011
All righty. Well,
congratulations, Sarge!

17:37.017 --> 17:38.283
And don't forget about us

17:38.318 --> 17:39.884
when you become a famous author.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.853
Terry's writing sucks.
Parlov is lying to him.

17:41.888 --> 17:44.556
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

17:44.591 --> 17:46.291
He's buttering him up...

17:46.326 --> 17:48.193
because Lawson and Parlov

17:48.228 --> 17:50.562
stole their own books!

17:50.597 --> 17:51.830
♪ Well, they stole their own books ♪

18:01.244 --> 18:02.878
Okay, we should go.

18:03.538 --> 18:05.382
Why do you think these
guys are in it together?

18:05.388 --> 18:07.121
They hate each other. They spent an hour

18:07.156 --> 18:08.851
arguing over the name of the
dragon in "The Hobbit."

18:08.857 --> 18:10.323
- "Smog."
- "Smowg."

18:10.358 --> 18:12.091
- Smog!
- Smowg!

18:12.126 --> 18:13.793
- Smog!
- Smowg!

18:14.103 --> 18:15.870
It's "Smowg," by the way...

18:15.876 --> 18:18.577
Point Lawson... but yes,
they're mortal enemies,

18:18.612 --> 18:20.011
which is why they think
we'll never suspect them

18:20.047 --> 18:21.346
of being in cahoots.

18:21.381 --> 18:22.948
Oh, but they cahooted, Rosa.

18:22.983 --> 18:25.450
They cahooted all over us.

18:25.486 --> 18:26.952
Gross. Why'd they leak their chapters?

18:26.987 --> 18:28.651
To get people excited, like when Carly

18:28.657 --> 18:29.932
Rae Jepsen puts out an amazing single,

18:29.938 --> 18:32.047
and you have to wait six weeks
for the album to come out.

18:32.053 --> 18:33.377
She's great. I'm not apologizing.

18:33.383 --> 18:35.356
So Parlov contacted
Terry because he knows

18:35.380 --> 18:37.247
Sarge is a super-fan and
can be manipulated.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.640
Yes, he's been giving Terry
presents since last year.

18:39.646 --> 18:40.836
And Terry's novel gave Parlov

18:40.842 --> 18:42.272
another chance to manipulate him.

18:42.278 --> 18:43.386
Unless...

18:43.422 --> 18:45.655
is it possible Parlov actually
likes Sarge's writing?

18:45.691 --> 18:47.657
Read the first sentence.

18:48.057 --> 18:49.890
- Yep, Parlov did it.
- Very much so.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.663
Gah! Now I have to tell Sarge

18:51.669 --> 18:53.803
that his fantasy novel stinks.

18:53.838 --> 18:56.605
This is the hardest part of being a cop.

18:56.641 --> 18:58.874
Now, there are issues with RFLP testing,

18:58.910 --> 19:01.010
as there are with every
technique, but...

19:01.045 --> 19:02.778
Captain, I thought you said

19:02.814 --> 19:04.680
your friend removed his mask and left.

19:04.715 --> 19:06.749
I forgot to lube up his face.

19:06.784 --> 19:08.751
We failed to listen to the instructions.

19:08.786 --> 19:10.468
That is incredibly careless.

19:10.474 --> 19:12.058
I know, and it means we won't receive

19:12.064 --> 19:13.989
our certification, and
I'm okay with that.

19:14.025 --> 19:16.025
- Unless my honesty...
- No, it's off the table.

19:16.060 --> 19:19.929
- And I'm okay with that.
- Well, anyway, RFLP testing

19:19.964 --> 19:21.897
was designed to localize
genetic disorders, and it...

19:21.933 --> 19:24.724
Ooh, my cousin Donna
has a genetic disorder

19:24.730 --> 19:26.702
where her lips were made of cartilage,

19:26.737 --> 19:28.771
meaning her mouth is technically a beak.

19:28.806 --> 19:30.439
I don't see how that
pertains to anything...

19:30.475 --> 19:31.941
No, let him talk. I want to hear it.

19:31.976 --> 19:33.976
Boyle, tell us about your cousin's beak.

19:34.011 --> 19:36.011
Well, she runs marathons

19:36.047 --> 19:37.718
to raise money for other people

19:37.724 --> 19:39.286
afflicted with "bird-face."

19:39.317 --> 19:40.483
There are only two of them.

19:40.518 --> 19:42.785
- They're her kids.
- Oh, Sarge!

19:42.820 --> 19:44.223
Funny seeing you here.

19:44.229 --> 19:45.855
Oh, that reminds me.

19:45.890 --> 19:47.756
I have to tell you something.
What was it?

19:47.792 --> 19:49.024
Out with it, Peralta.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.726
Okay, fine. Here it goes.

19:50.761 --> 19:52.795
- I think that...
- Parlov hated my book.

19:52.830 --> 19:55.464
He only said he liked it
so I wouldn't figure out

19:55.500 --> 19:57.700
he and Lawson stole
their own manuscripts.

19:57.735 --> 19:59.584
- You figured it out.
- Well, I had a gut feeling,

19:59.590 --> 20:00.707
so I went digging.

20:00.713 --> 20:02.734
I got a warrant for
Parlov's browser history.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.773
He searched "how to liquidate Bitcoins"

20:04.779 --> 20:06.679
three days before the
laptops were stolen.

20:06.685 --> 20:08.677
Man, I bet that browser
history was a nightmare, huh?

20:08.713 --> 20:10.354
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Yeah.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.481
Anyway, I questioned them,
and they confessed.

20:12.517 --> 20:13.983
I can't go to prison, okay?

20:14.018 --> 20:16.352
I know I seem tough, but I'm not.

20:16.387 --> 20:17.946
- I went to Bennington.
- Ew.

20:17.952 --> 20:19.889
I'm sorry Parlov didn't like your book.

20:19.924 --> 20:21.524
And I didn't. And also Rosa.

20:21.559 --> 20:23.425
- Why did I add that?
- No, it's okay.

20:23.461 --> 20:25.732
At least I won't waste any more
time trying to be a writer.

20:25.738 --> 20:27.371
Wait, let me ask you a question.

20:27.524 --> 20:29.331
Are you a better cop now
than when you started?

20:29.367 --> 20:31.567
- Nope.
- Wasn't talking to you.

20:31.602 --> 20:33.936
Yeah. I look back at my old cases

20:33.971 --> 20:35.804
and I can't believe how long

20:35.840 --> 20:38.244
- it took me to figure things out.
- Yeah, but you worked on it,

20:38.250 --> 20:39.708
and you kept working, and now,

20:39.744 --> 20:41.911
12 to 40 years later...

20:41.946 --> 20:43.546
I don't have a good sense of your age...

20:43.581 --> 20:45.314
You're a great cop who
got a "gut feeling"

20:45.349 --> 20:46.815
and solved a huge case.

20:46.851 --> 20:48.584
So you think I should keep writing?

20:48.619 --> 20:50.486
I mean, you might not become
a huge famous author,

20:50.521 --> 20:51.987
but you'll get better,

20:52.023 --> 20:54.221
and if it makes you happy,
it can't be that bad.

20:54.227 --> 20:56.321
Sheryl Crow, she's great.
I won't apologize.

20:56.327 --> 20:57.960
And who knows? Claire Essalgorn

20:57.995 --> 20:59.695
didn't start writing the
first "Crimson Portal" novel

20:59.730 --> 21:01.797
until she was 60.

21:01.832 --> 21:03.933
I started reading it because
the character looks like me.

21:03.968 --> 21:06.001
I kept reading it because it's so good!

21:06.037 --> 21:08.337
Rosa, you did get hooked, you big nerd!

21:08.372 --> 21:09.605
This heroine is my heroin.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.440
Oh, such a dweebus. I love it!

21:11.475 --> 21:13.809
Speaking of which, Parlov's
laptop is in evidence.

21:13.844 --> 21:15.474
Want to go read the new "Skyfire" book?

21:15.480 --> 21:17.012
Oh, I don't know.

21:17.048 --> 21:18.981
I mean, he's such a bad guy.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.716
Do we even like his books anymore?
