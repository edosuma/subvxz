more synergy-inducing and cool

has always inspired me.

It's what makes Star Kreme the world's
largest coffee and donut company.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.688

we issue a new flavor,

our newest flavor to the family.

this could be possible.

02:13.591 --> 02:19.304
But after long hours in the lab
and extensive market analysis,

02:19.305 --> 02:22.224
I can confidently say

02:22.225 --> 02:24.643
that this is
statistically guaranteed

02:24.644 --> 02:26.770
to be our most
popular flavor ever.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.239

at that music festival,

the story behind their food.

their kale is grown,

their chia seed jam was made.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.752
Oh. Well, uh...

02:50.753 --> 02:54.006
I guess the story
for Cinnalicious is

02:54.007 --> 02:57.009
that it was... made in a lab

02:57.010 --> 02:58.552
and based on a focus group.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.097
Exactly, which is
why it will fail.

No, no, no, we're gonna use
real beans from a real farm.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.501

something hand-picked.

03:31.502 --> 03:32.920

this place or the beans?

at Colombian beans.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.316
Come on.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.568
Yes! Yes! Yes.

15:45.569 --> 15:48.864
No! Aw, you gotta be kidding me.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.750
When I get my own lab,

16:00.751 --> 16:02.919
I'm gonna design water.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.297
[laughs]
Water has already been invented.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.133
And when I get my own lab,

16:09.134 --> 16:11.011
it's gonna be air conditioned.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.809
The Dancing Goat.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.976
We're here.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.187
- The Dancing Goat!
- Yes.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.065
Thank you.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.027
And thank you.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.490
Let's buy some beans.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.372
Hello?

16:39.456 --> 16:40.708
Hola?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.380
Is anybody here?

16:47.381 --> 16:48.507
- [insect buzzing]
- Oh!

16:50.718 --> 16:51.802
[exclaiming]

16:57.516 --> 16:59.017
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

17:00.018 --> 17:04.064
No! No! No! [exclaims]

17:06.233 --> 17:07.276
Okay.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.279
Oh, gross!

17:11.613 --> 17:13.948
[Man]
The shelter is in town.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.116
Hi.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.410
I just got here.

17:17.453 --> 17:22.039
Okay. Well, you can stay tonight
in the barn.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.877
But the last mendigo tried to steal our
donkey, so please don't get any ideas.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.796
Believe me.
I don't wanna see a donkey...

17:28.797 --> 17:31.382
Hey, I'm not homeless!

17:31.383 --> 17:33.968
No, I've come to talk
to Diego Valdez.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.553
Oh, sure.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.599
And what do you want
with Diego Valdez?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.185
Oh. Sorry.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.104
I don't normally
look like this or...

17:45.105 --> 17:47.148
[sniffs] Oh!

17:47.149 --> 17:50.110
I don't smell like this either.

17:53.071 --> 17:54.071
I'm Zoe Walker.

17:54.072 --> 17:56.742
I'm a coffee buyer
from Star Kreme.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.164
[speaking Spanish]

18:06.627 --> 18:07.669
You?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.671
How did you get here before...

18:10.672 --> 18:12.256
I left before you.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.343
I took a plane.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.262
You said I had to go
on a long journey.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.766
Your fortune said
a long journey.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.269
Tia, how could you bring
this American filisteo...

18:25.270 --> 18:27.021
- Hey!
- ...to my plantation?

18:27.022 --> 18:29.440
Don't be so rude, Diego.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.276
Hey, you're Diego Valdez?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.487
Yeah. Yeah, and let me guess.

18:34.488 --> 18:39.575
My aunt fed you an El Dorado tale
about some magical plantation.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.913
Normally, I would think
it was a scam...

18:43.831 --> 18:46.500
but I tasted your coffee.

18:47.668 --> 18:51.212
And it is the real deal,

18:51.213 --> 18:54.257
so... So I came.

18:54.258 --> 18:59.303
I would rather burn this entire
plantation to the ground

18:59.304 --> 19:01.181
than ever sell to you.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.648
[sighs]
My nephew can be
a little dramatic.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.236
Oh, my god! What have I done?

19:15.237 --> 19:17.238
Remember.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.367
Your wish will come true.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.459
Which way to the barn?

19:32.671 --> 19:35.799
I can offer you a room
much better than the barn.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.265
I really appreciate
you letting me stay here.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.267
I'm sorry about Diego.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.352
He has trouble with change.

19:48.353 --> 19:52.357
But, you know, old ways
don't open new doors.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.734
Aw!

19:54.735 --> 19:57.737
Is this Diego
and his little sister?

19:57.738 --> 20:01.032
Well, I suppose
they do look alike,

20:01.033 --> 20:02.575
but that's Olivia.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.286
She grew up on the next farm.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.955
Olivia was Diego's fiancée,

20:07.956 --> 20:10.041
but that's all in the past.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.208
I'm sorry.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.752
No, things happen.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.297
Listen, I really do want to share
your coffee with the world,

20:16.298 --> 20:18.716
but Diego seems pretty adamant.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.259
Maybe I came on too strong.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.054
I definitely wasn't
my most professional.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.431
Tomorrow is a new day.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.516
I let you settle in.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.101
Maybe take a shower.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.770
Oh, definitely.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.063
Thank you.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.898
Welcome.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.900
Star Kreme! [scoffs]

20:35.901 --> 20:37.819
More like Star Crap!

20:38.904 --> 20:41.822
All the monstrosities
they come up with.

20:41.823 --> 20:45.701
Hey, how about a Hot Dog Latte?

20:45.702 --> 20:47.995
Wow! It sounds delicious, right?

20:47.996 --> 20:50.331
Or a Waffle Macchiato?

20:50.332 --> 20:51.582
Jesus!

20:51.583 --> 20:54.419
Why not just serve flavored mud?

20:56.630 --> 20:58.047
Oh, Tia.

20:58.048 --> 21:03.260
Please, that nice girl came all
the way here to buy from you,

21:03.261 --> 21:05.596
and you turned her away. Please!

21:05.597 --> 21:07.390
Nice girl?

21:07.391 --> 21:11.185
Tia, who knows what junk
she wants to turn my beans into.

21:11.186 --> 21:16.315
"Junk"? The only junk I hear are the
words coming out of your mouth.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.402
I'm very disappointed
with you, Diego.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.780
You are a wonderful farmer...

21:22.656 --> 21:25.658
but a pesimo empresario.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.660
Yeah, you're always raving

21:27.661 --> 21:32.289
how people nowadays don't
understand the beauty of coffee.

21:32.290 --> 21:35.961
This is your chance. Show her.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.010
This is our last year, Diego.

21:44.302 --> 21:46.929
I know that. You know that.

21:46.930 --> 21:50.641
But it doesn't have to be
if you make this deal.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.853
This girl, Zoe, is here,

21:53.854 --> 21:55.897
and she can help us.

21:56.898 --> 21:57.941
Yeah?

21:58.942 --> 22:00.777
[speaking Spanish]

22:19.087 --> 22:20.838
- [exclaims]
- Whoa! Oh, my god!

22:20.839 --> 22:22.382
Don't you knock?

22:26.928 --> 22:29.513
I suppose you've come
to send me to the barn.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.307
Uh, no.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.268
I thought you might be hungry.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.937
Um...

22:36.938 --> 22:40.107
This is sancocho de gallina,

22:40.108 --> 22:44.487
chicken soup with root
vegetables, my aunt's specialty.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.865
Well... thank you.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.116
Sure.

22:49.117 --> 22:51.912
And, uh, I also...

22:53.038 --> 22:54.581
wanted to...

22:58.668 --> 22:59.753
make a deal.

23:01.338 --> 23:06.842
Look, you caught me
at a very difficult time.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.553
I will sell my beans
to Star Kreme, but...

23:09.554 --> 23:13.933
they're not to be used
in any asqueroso flavors.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.435
They must be sold as-is.

23:16.436 --> 23:19.021
You know,
not all flavors are bad.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.440
I mean, if we only knew vanilla,

23:21.441 --> 23:24.735
we wouldn't know the joys
of chocolate or Rocky Road.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.779
And I for one would not wanna
live in a world without...

23:26.780 --> 23:28.405
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

23:28.406 --> 23:33.786
My family didn't toil under the
Colombian sun for six generations

23:33.787 --> 23:35.412
to make Rocky Road.

23:35.413 --> 23:38.082
They did it to make coffee,

23:38.083 --> 23:41.127
pure, unadulterated coffee,

23:41.128 --> 23:43.797
and that's the only way
I will sell it.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.924
Okay, fine.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.219
Look, we really value
your beans,

23:50.220 --> 23:53.347
and Star Kreme would be honored
to be a part of that.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.516
No flavors.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.685
Star Kreme would be honored,

23:57.686 --> 24:00.271
because Star Kreme
really values my beans.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.523
Mm-hmm. Values, appreciates,
adores.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.150
We can have the trucks here
by tomorrow.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.152
We haven't finished
the final harvest,

24:06.153 --> 24:07.695
and roasting takes time.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.489
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
We'll do the roasting ourselves.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.325
Roasting is
the most important part.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.411
Oh.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.121
I'll tell you what.

24:17.122 --> 24:24.044
You can prove how much Star Kreme
appreciates, values, adores my beans

24:24.045 --> 24:26.882
by doing the final harvest
with me.

24:28.049 --> 24:31.760
I must know my beans are
in the hands of someone

24:31.761 --> 24:35.389
who understands that coffee is
not just a simple beverage,

24:35.390 --> 24:37.474
but an invitation to life. Hmm?

24:37.475 --> 24:39.310
[sighs]

24:39.311 --> 24:42.563
You will work from dawn to dusk.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.024
You will pour your sweat
and blood into the soil.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.150
Blood?

24:46.151 --> 24:49.863
You will fall in love
with my beans.

24:51.031 --> 24:54.700
Okay, and how long
does bean-love take?

24:54.701 --> 24:57.037
Oh, a lifetime.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.623
But realistically, a few days.

25:00.624 --> 25:06.004
So, you may bring your trucks once
you have made the perfect roast.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.633
I will think about it.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.969
Fine. Think about it.

25:13.970 --> 25:17.514
But if you're in,
we start tomorrow.

25:17.515 --> 25:18.600
6:00 a.m.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.944
[rooster crowing]

25:43.875 --> 25:45.000
Wow.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.044
Good morning.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.797
So, do we have a deal?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.048
We have a deal.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.300
I will make the perfect roast...

25:53.301 --> 25:54.844
or die trying.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.808
This looks amazing. Thank you.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.018
You're welcome.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.564
Oh, my goodness! Mmm!

26:07.565 --> 26:10.484
I'm detecting banana,

26:10.485 --> 26:13.112
strawberry, and...

26:13.113 --> 26:14.154
mango.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.824
It has a high pulp concentration

26:16.825 --> 26:19.243
and yet a sherbet-like texture.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.786
Do you always talk like that?

26:20.787 --> 26:23.914
What is
this most delectable fruit?

26:23.915 --> 26:25.000
[Man]
Cherimoya.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.003
Yeah, it's called cherimoya.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.880
Mark Twain...
No, no, let me. Let me.

26:31.881 --> 26:37.344
Mark Twain called it "the most
delicious fruit known to man."

26:37.345 --> 26:42.474
But, you know, I think it is the most
delicious fruit known to donkeys.

26:42.475 --> 26:45.728
I introduce myself.
My name is Jorge,

26:45.729 --> 26:48.939
but everybody here
calls me Caturra.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.817
And this... This is Peaberry.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.445
Hi. I'm Zoe.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.571
Sorry?

26:55.572 --> 26:56.613
Zoe.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.907
Zoe? What's that? A name?

26:58.908 --> 27:00.451
No, we're gonna do something.

27:00.452 --> 27:04.955
You call me Caturra, and I'll call you...
Pelo Loco, okay?

27:04.956 --> 27:07.291
- Okay, that sounds pretty.
- Yeah.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.918
That means "crazy hair".

27:09.919 --> 27:11.546
- Oh.
- [Jorge laughs]

27:12.922 --> 27:14.131
He's very cute.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.633
No, no, Peaberry...

27:16.634 --> 27:18.052
Peaberry is a woman.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.638
- [brays]
- Oh, I am so sorry.

27:21.639 --> 27:24.683
- How would you like some cherimoya, Peaberry?
- Oh, come on.

27:24.684 --> 27:27.061
- That's it.
- Oh, she loves it.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.979
Yeah, she does.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.607
Good girl.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.319
I think that's enough.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.404
Eat up.

27:38.239 --> 27:44.328
[Diego] First, you need to stand on
the soil and feel the plants' energy.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.288
Okay, ready? Good.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.500
You will pick the entire row.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.210
Only the red cherries.

27:51.211 --> 27:55.464
And tomorrow, you will pick
the whole row again.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.965
What? Why?

27:56.966 --> 28:00.302
The orange cherries
will be ripe tomorrow.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.595
I'm sorry,

28:01.596 --> 28:03.680
but this is not
an instant blend.

28:03.681 --> 28:05.849
Quality takes time.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.351
It sure does.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.353
Hey, you're the girl from town.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.979
And you're the coffee buyer.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.232
She spent the night, I see.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.692
Here comes trouble.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.986
[speaking Spanish]

28:17.987 --> 28:20.030
Don't call her mula.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.909
What are you doing here, Olivia?

28:24.035 --> 28:26.246
I just got back.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.666
I thought that we could talk.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.878
Well, uh...

28:34.879 --> 28:38.132
I'm busy. I'm busy right
now with my new worker,

28:38.133 --> 28:40.885
and we were just about
to start picking.

28:42.387 --> 28:46.974
I should go, uh...
make a phone call.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.852
You guys should talk.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.322
Hey, you know, you don't have
to show me where the phone is.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.283
I'm sure I can
find it by myself.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.576
Are you okay?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.953
She thinks she can just
show up after years and what...

29:07.954 --> 29:10.581
Oh! Who is this little fatty?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.124
What? What?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.377
Oh. That's, uh, Jorge.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.629
No way!

29:17.630 --> 29:20.507
Gosh! You guys have known each other
for quite some time then, huh?

29:20.508 --> 29:23.093
My parents cared for him.

29:23.094 --> 29:28.223
Oh, they cared for his pet as well.
That's Peaberry.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.808
Oh, wow.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.644
Your parents sound incredible.

29:32.770 --> 29:33.855
They were.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.274
Okay, uh, make it quick.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.027
We've got a lot of work to do.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.738
[Zoe]
Hey, Diego.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.281
Yeah?

29:44.282 --> 29:47.784
I hope my presence doesn't complicate
anything between you and Olivia.

29:47.785 --> 29:51.706
Oh, it's already
pretty complicated.

29:57.337 --> 30:01.174
[rotary phone dialing]

30:04.302 --> 30:07.346
Need a phone from this century?

30:07.347 --> 30:08.932
That would be great.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.145
My room.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.939
Oh!

30:16.940 --> 30:18.483
[both laughing]

30:19.526 --> 30:21.777
What can I say?

30:21.778 --> 30:24.988
Diego's parents
really loved coffee.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.658
I gather they're not
around anymore.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.911
Yes, they passed away years ago.

30:30.912 --> 30:31.871
Oh.

30:31.872 --> 30:35.874
Diego and I are
the only Valdez left.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.000
I'm so sorry.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.963
Ah, the memories still live on
in our hearts.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.298
Oh, your phone!

30:43.550 --> 30:46.009
[Zoe]
Oh, wow!

30:46.010 --> 30:48.680
Or do you prefer my computer?

30:50.181 --> 30:51.432
[Olivia]
Diego?

30:52.350 --> 30:54.852
Diego, come on. Don't avoid me.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.605
I don't hear from you for years,

30:58.606 --> 31:01.692
and then you just
suddenly show up.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.527
I'm sorry.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.612
It was wrong of me
the way I disappeared.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.532
I don't know what happened
to you in London,

31:08.533 --> 31:10.784
but you cannot
just come back here

31:10.785 --> 31:12.870
and expect everything
to be the same.

31:13.871 --> 31:15.956
I've moved on.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.875
It's her...

31:18.876 --> 31:20.669
the coffee buyer?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.296
Her name is Zoe,

31:22.297 --> 31:24.881
and she's not just helping me
with the harvest,

31:24.882 --> 31:28.761
but she is going to share
my coffee with the world.

31:32.890 --> 31:34.391
[Skype call ringing]

31:34.392 --> 31:37.394
- [electronic music]
- Oh. Mr. Gobbs?

31:37.395 --> 31:40.022
[Gobbs through computer]
What do you think?
It's called Moroccan Boy.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.732
It's the hot
tan shade this year.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.108
I was not aware of that.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.651
[Gobbs through computer]
Where you been, yo?

31:44.652 --> 31:47.070
Star Kreme-ers need to stay
in Star communication.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.073
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.743
But I have exactly
what we're looking for.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.203
We have a great story.

31:55.204 --> 31:58.415
The plantation is natural,
organic, and legendary.

31:58.416 --> 32:05.047
[Zoe through computer]
It produces the highest-grade
quality coffee, farm to cup.

32:05.048 --> 32:08.091
[Gobbs through computer]
What did you say?
Say that again. What was that?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.468
"Farm to cup"?

32:09.469 --> 32:11.928
That's brilliant!
How much have you shipped?

32:11.929 --> 32:14.931
Well, they're
very eco-conscious.

32:14.932 --> 32:18.852
They wanna make sure the people buying
their coffee really appreciate it.

32:18.853 --> 32:21.647
We'll ship as soon as I finish
helping with the harvest.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.774
Ingenious approach. Zoe!

32:23.775 --> 32:26.902
Zoe, Zoe, you are brilliant.

32:26.903 --> 32:27.944
Thank you, sir.

32:27.945 --> 32:30.113
Everyone is gonna
want Cinnalicious now.

32:30.114 --> 32:33.450
This is gonna be our... our...
our El Dorado!

32:33.451 --> 32:36.119
About that, sir...

32:36.120 --> 32:38.748
[Gobbs through computer]
You're not worried about that lab, are you?

32:41.417 --> 32:43.794
- How did you know?
- [Gobbs through computer] I haven't forgotten.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.629
You just make sure
nothing derails Cinnalicious.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.173
I want those beans ASAP.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.966
Gobbs out.

32:49.967 --> 32:51.843
Sir...

32:51.844 --> 32:53.054
Sir? The...

32:58.601 --> 33:01.604
Okay. Let's do this.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.280
Man, this is going
to take forever.

33:12.281 --> 33:15.158
Gee, I'm really loving the land.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.161
Totally appreciating nature.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.415
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
[speaking Spanish]

33:21.416 --> 33:23.500
It's all in the wrist.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.627
Check it out.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.678
My wrist technique is legendary.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.346
I bet it is.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.265
Do you want me to teach you?

33:38.266 --> 33:40.726
It's very easy. Here, look.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.603
You grab a bunch of beans,

33:43.604 --> 33:44.647
you twist...

33:45.815 --> 33:49.818
you push down with your thumb.
You see?

33:49.819 --> 33:50.903
And that's it.

33:52.029 --> 33:53.905
I guess I could use some help.

33:53.906 --> 33:54.990
- Yeah.
- Cool.

33:54.991 --> 33:59.536
Here, um... try that branch
right there.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.206
Aw! Cute!
Look at the little frog.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.916
Aw!

34:04.917 --> 34:07.170
I think he likes you.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.880
- No!
- What?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.382
Geez! What?

34:12.382 --> 34:15.552
God, that thing was, like,
the size of my pinky toe.
Don't worry.

34:15.553 --> 34:19.431
That thing carries enough poison
on its skin to kill 10 men.

34:19.431 --> 34:20.599
What?

34:20.600 --> 34:23.726
How could you not have told me
that was poisonous?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.353
I could have died.

34:26.272 --> 34:28.565
I, uh, guess I forgot.

34:28.565 --> 34:31.485
Forgot? That was crazy, Olivia.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.696
Just the way you like it.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.908
[speaking Spanish]

34:37.909 --> 34:39.909
- [Peaberry braying]
- Why did you do that?

34:39.911 --> 34:41.244
Peaberry!

34:41.245 --> 34:42.913
Come on. Peaberry!

34:42.914 --> 34:46.081
No, no, no, no, no.
Peaberry, come on. Come here.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.376
I am so sorry, Jorge.

34:48.377 --> 34:50.629
I lost my best friend forever.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.088
Okay, that's enough.

34:52.089 --> 34:53.965
You, no more picking.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.132
- And you...
- Hmm?

34:55.134 --> 34:56.760
What are you even doing here?

34:56.761 --> 34:58.512
Take that basket off.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.679
Why?

34:59.680 --> 35:01.307
I'm just doing what I'm good at.

35:04.727 --> 35:05.770
Uh...

35:07.146 --> 35:10.398
Okay, if I'm not picking,
can I be roasting?

35:10.399 --> 35:15.320
You will now learn to pulverize.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.656
Come. Follow me.

35:17.657 --> 35:18.741
Thanks for nothing.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.870
[sighs]

35:23.871 --> 35:25.164
Oh!

35:26.123 --> 35:27.874
Is this where you murder me?

35:27.875 --> 35:29.292
What...

35:29.293 --> 35:32.963
Here is where I show you
the despulpadora.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.423
You know, I feel really bad
about Peaberry.

35:35.424 --> 35:38.802
And what is wrong with Olivia?

35:38.803 --> 35:41.972
Donkeys are bred to be with men.
She'll return.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.808
And as for Olivia...

35:44.809 --> 35:46.518
we have some issues.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.437
I would like to apologize
for what happened there.

35:49.438 --> 35:51.773
You know what?
Don't worry about it.
Let's just get through this.

35:51.774 --> 35:54.651
What did you call this again?
The Dora the Explorer?

35:54.652 --> 35:57.988
[scoffs]
The despulpadora.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.781
Okay?

35:59.782 --> 36:00.783
Excuse me.

36:04.078 --> 36:06.830
Other farms use
a mechanical one,

36:06.831 --> 36:09.833
but this is more selective.

36:09.834 --> 36:16.339
You can actually see which beans have
been de-skinned and which haven't, okay?

36:16.340 --> 36:17.550
Watch it.

36:21.178 --> 36:26.224
[grunts]
Oh, and it's a better workout than CrossFit.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.185
Ugh! Great.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.481
Oh, hey, when am I
gonna be able to roast?

36:33.482 --> 36:34.650
When you're ready.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.279
All yours.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.536
[straining] Oh, come on.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.289
Why didn't I do more CrossFit?

36:52.418 --> 36:53.752
Really?

36:53.753 --> 36:55.546
A dart frog?

36:56.797 --> 36:58.965
That was crazy, Olivia.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.216
I don't trust her, Diego.

37:00.217 --> 37:03.053
Trust? Oh, come on!

37:03.054 --> 37:04.846
You tried to kill her.

37:04.847 --> 37:07.891
Oh, come on.
Don't exaggerate.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.686
Plus, I'm sure that Tia Juanita
has some medicine.

37:12.063 --> 37:17.026
Besides...
it's natural selection.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.236
[laughs]

37:20.780 --> 37:22.865
But you know I'm serious.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.076
There is something up.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.287
What's going on
between you and her?

37:30.373 --> 37:32.290
How could you, Diego,

37:32.291 --> 37:36.461
from the great Valdez family sell
to a company like Star Kreme?

37:36.462 --> 37:38.088
I know you,

37:38.089 --> 37:40.716
and I know that you prefer to burn
this whole plantation to the ground.

37:41.759 --> 37:44.804
Well... maybe
you don't know me anymore.

37:46.013 --> 37:47.764
Where are you going?

37:47.765 --> 37:49.934
At least give me a ride.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.028
So...

38:02.113 --> 38:04.532
what happened to your motorbike?

38:05.449 --> 38:07.326
I don't ride anymore.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.496
That's not surprising.

38:11.497 --> 38:14.791
[scoffs]
What's that supposed to mean?

38:14.792 --> 38:18.170
Let me remind you that
you always hated having fun.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.131
Some things never change.

38:21.132 --> 38:26.387
Well, our priorities
were always different.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.234
Looks like your parents
got new gates.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.653
Would you like to stop in?

38:43.654 --> 38:46.032
I'm sure that my parents
would love to see you.

38:48.617 --> 38:51.077
Maybe some other time.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.620
Sure.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.040
Bye.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.132
Hey, wait.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.011
It was good to see you.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.015
I know.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.697
[breathing heavily]

39:28.616 --> 39:31.201
Every part of me is sore.

39:31.202 --> 39:35.914
[sighs] I can't feel my limbs.

39:35.915 --> 39:39.209
If only I could feel my heart.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.045
Dinner will be ready
en un santiamén.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.880
I don't understand.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.423
In a jiffy.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.841
Jorge, please.

39:46.842 --> 39:52.639
I'm just gonna...
sit here for a while

39:52.640 --> 39:56.477
and just... relax.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.612
Diego, I don't want you
to lose focus.

40:07.613 --> 40:10.616
When Olivia is around,
you don't think straight.

40:12.284 --> 40:15.912
And why are you being
so hard on Zoe?

40:15.913 --> 40:18.164
Putting her to work
in the fields?

40:18.165 --> 40:21.376
She doesn't know the land
or what's dangerous.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.254
I'm teaching her
to appreciate coffee

40:24.255 --> 40:26.923
and protecting our legacy.

40:26.924 --> 40:30.260
But maybe I don't have
to sell to Star Kreme.

40:30.261 --> 40:34.055
Maybe Olivia's return
is for a reason.

40:34.056 --> 40:36.975
Please, Diego, open your eyes.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.435
You don't need Olivia that way.

40:39.436 --> 40:44.607
Tia, how do I know
if I can trust Zoe?

40:44.608 --> 40:45.859
I know Olivia.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.611
Then you should know
not to trust her.

40:48.612 --> 40:54.534
Okay, do you think Ama y Apa, who
dedicated their lives to this place,

40:54.535 --> 40:59.706
would want to get involved with
a glorified fast food chain?

40:59.707 --> 41:06.921
I think su papa y su mama would
want you to be your own man.

41:06.922 --> 41:09.383
Dinner will be ready soon.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.012
Dinner is ready.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.222
Shh!

41:25.274 --> 41:27.358
Aw, man!

41:27.359 --> 41:29.778
I gotta work out more.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.034
Okay.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.454
[sighs]

41:49.840 --> 41:52.885
Sleep well, scientist.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.089
Peaberry.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.007
I have a cherimoya.

42:33.008 --> 42:34.968
[braying]

42:34.969 --> 42:36.928
Peaberry?

42:36.929 --> 42:40.057
- Peaberry.
- [Jorge] No, it is I.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.726
Sadly, it is only I.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.645
I guess you were
looking for her too, huh?

42:45.646 --> 42:47.981
Yeah. I'm gonna
tell you something

42:47.982 --> 42:51.401
that maybe it could sound
a little bit crazy.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.153
But even when I was with her,

42:54.154 --> 42:55.738
I miss her.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.616
Hey, I'm really sorry
about Peaberry.

42:58.617 --> 43:00.493
No, no, no, it's not your fault.

43:00.494 --> 43:03.538
It's Olivia.
She upsets everything.

43:03.539 --> 43:06.250
What was I thinking,
coming here and farming?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.627
I guess I was just so...

43:09.628 --> 43:11.004
Desperate?

43:11.005 --> 43:14.590
Driven.
I was going to say driven.

43:14.591 --> 43:16.384
Ah.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.678
Yeah, you're right.
I guess I was desperate.

43:18.679 --> 43:21.431
I swore I would have
my own lab someday.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.224
I just wanted to prove it.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.600
Prove it to who?

43:24.601 --> 43:27.021
To yourself or to someone else?

43:28.647 --> 43:31.566
I don't know why
I let my ex get to me.

43:31.567 --> 43:34.069
He's a liar.
He stole everything.

43:35.237 --> 43:39.115
I know what it feels
to have your heart stolen.

43:39.116 --> 43:41.242
Oh, no, no, no.
He stole my idea.

43:41.243 --> 43:42.952
Ah! Ideas!

43:42.953 --> 43:45.413
Ah, no, no, no. Don't worry.

43:45.414 --> 43:46.664
You'll have more.

43:46.665 --> 43:51.419
Okay, but lately...
Lately, I've just been stuck.

43:51.420 --> 43:55.256
Look, you work hard
and with your heart.

43:55.257 --> 43:57.759
That's something
that Olivia never did.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.011
So, come on, Pelo Loco.

44:00.012 --> 44:03.306
You're smart, so use that.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.017
Sorry. Zoe.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.379
Where is everybody?

44:42.554 --> 44:43.806
Gracias.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.018
Okay.

44:52.564 --> 44:53.982
Buenos días.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.198
Hey.

45:02.157 --> 45:03.449
What is all this?

45:03.450 --> 45:06.286
Now, we don't have to waste time
lugging them downhill.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.374
Okay.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.458
What do you think?

45:13.961 --> 45:15.545
Not bad.

45:15.546 --> 45:18.214
By the way,
do you have any more rope?

45:18.215 --> 45:20.049
Yeah, sure.

45:20.050 --> 45:22.510
Show me. [giggles]

45:22.511 --> 45:23.761
Check this out.

45:23.762 --> 45:25.096
What are you doing?

45:25.097 --> 45:26.180
Wait for it.

45:26.181 --> 45:28.434
Hey, be careful.
This ladder is old.

45:31.895 --> 45:33.813
Just a little bit more.

45:33.814 --> 45:36.233
Okay.

45:38.402 --> 45:41.404
Okay. There.

45:41.405 --> 45:44.574
- [screams]
- Whoa! Hey. Hey. Hey.

45:44.575 --> 45:45.825
Nice catch.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.369
Um, my pleasure.

45:48.370 --> 45:49.705
Okay.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.502
All right.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.297
Not bad, huh?

45:59.298 --> 46:01.090
It doesn't use any more energy,

46:01.091 --> 46:04.219
it's still using your
grandfather's device, and...

46:05.596 --> 46:09.307
it allows for the worker
to clean up a little bit.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.851
[Diego]
Let's go.

46:11.852 --> 46:12.936
Whew!

46:14.480 --> 46:16.772
[exhales]

46:16.773 --> 46:18.192
[grunts]

46:20.527 --> 46:22.153
Good.

46:22.154 --> 46:26.032
So, we have pick,
pulverize, wash,

46:26.033 --> 46:27.408
and now, rake.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.534
Rake?

46:28.535 --> 46:30.870
No, when am I gonna
be able to roast?

46:30.871 --> 46:33.289
Hey, in time. I promise.

46:33.290 --> 46:37.460
[sighs] I liked it better
in the murder shed...

46:37.461 --> 46:39.046
with the fan.

46:40.297 --> 46:43.842
Some plantations use
a mechanical dryer.

46:44.718 --> 46:47.637
But there is nothing better

46:47.638 --> 46:51.974
than the beautiful
climbing sun, right?

46:51.975 --> 46:53.268
Okay.

46:54.144 --> 46:56.396
- Here, you try.
- Thank you.

46:58.732 --> 47:01.484
Yeah, start raking.

47:01.485 --> 47:04.946
[exerting] Aw, man!
No wonder you're so ripped!

47:04.947 --> 47:08.741
I mean, from
an observational standpoint,

47:08.742 --> 47:11.911
your biceps are
in peak condition.

47:11.912 --> 47:18.793
[laughs] Okay, uh... Just, uh,
continue raking while...

47:18.794 --> 47:22.631
[breathing heavily]

47:27.010 --> 47:28.679
Wait a minute!

47:31.932 --> 47:32.975
Excuse me.

47:52.077 --> 47:53.412
Yes!

47:54.454 --> 47:55.705
That's gotta be faster.

47:55.706 --> 47:58.916
How do you do that?

47:58.917 --> 48:00.835
- What?
- That.

48:00.836 --> 48:02.545
Think like that.

48:02.546 --> 48:04.714
Well, uh...

48:04.715 --> 48:09.218
I guess I've always enjoyed
problem solving, being creative.

48:09.219 --> 48:12.722
Just... I haven't had a big idea
in a long time.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.182
What was your last big idea?

48:15.183 --> 48:17.185
Well, I...

48:18.395 --> 48:20.229
I invented the Glo-nut.

48:20.230 --> 48:21.272
The what?

48:21.273 --> 48:24.610
It's a colorful croissant-donut.

48:25.861 --> 48:26.861
Okay.

48:26.862 --> 48:29.780
Well, that actually
sounds pretty good.

48:29.781 --> 48:31.782
Yeah.

48:31.783 --> 48:33.619
Everybody loves it.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.414
You know what?

48:38.415 --> 48:42.084
I think you're ready to roast.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.254
- Finally.
- Yes.

48:45.672 --> 48:49.216
Oh, it is so nice
and cool in here.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.011
Not for long.

48:55.015 --> 48:56.515
- Okay.
- No way.

48:56.516 --> 48:58.976
You can't possibly roast all
those beans on this tiny thing.

48:58.977 --> 49:00.895
- Oh, no, actually...
- Whoa!

49:00.896 --> 49:03.398
we usually use the machine.

49:04.983 --> 49:09.570
But my father learned how to make
the perfect roast over a fire,

49:09.571 --> 49:11.615
and his father before that.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.451
Before he passed away,

49:15.452 --> 49:20.332
we used to stand here
side by side together.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.795
And he taught me
to make the perfect roast.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.506
Well, I am going to try my best.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.050
Good.

49:31.051 --> 49:34.762
So, put in only a smidgen
of beans, okay?

49:34.763 --> 49:36.139
A smidgen?

49:37.099 --> 49:38.767
Compared to a sack...

49:41.603 --> 49:44.313
it's like three dollops.

49:44.314 --> 49:46.233
[shakes beans in pan]

49:47.526 --> 49:51.278
Stir the beans until
you hear a "pop, pop, pop",

49:51.279 --> 49:52.863
just like popcorn...

49:52.864 --> 49:55.282
which also came from Colombia.

49:55.283 --> 49:56.867
- No way.
- Yeah.

49:56.868 --> 50:03.374
Hey, by the way, maybe Star Kreme
wants to make a Popcorn Cappuccino.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.917
- Wow.
- Come on!

50:04.918 --> 50:07.086
- What? No, I'm serious.
- No, you are not.

50:07.087 --> 50:09.839
Ye... Of course I'm not.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.717
Okay.

50:15.095 --> 50:18.598
So, I guess Olivia
is not around today, huh?

50:20.434 --> 50:21.810
I don't know.

50:23.603 --> 50:25.188
You must have missed her.

50:26.523 --> 50:28.399
Well, uh...

50:28.400 --> 50:32.403
her absence caused
a lot of problems.

50:32.404 --> 50:36.198
We were going to merge
our two farms together.

50:36.199 --> 50:40.536
[clears throat] Oh, okay,
so, you keep stirring

50:40.537 --> 50:45.541
until the beans turn the color
of soil after it rains, okay?

50:45.542 --> 50:49.587
"The color of soil after it rains"?
What does that even...

50:49.588 --> 50:51.046
Hey, where are you going?

50:51.047 --> 50:53.049
To bring you more beans.

How are you?

Is Diego home?

51:15.655 --> 51:17.740
Don't you "Mama Tia" me.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.784
You broke that boy's heart,

51:19.785 --> 51:22.286

to put it back together.

in this place.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.251
We used to get so hot...

I did it!

58:05.983 --> 58:08.150
And so, to the Tejo King
and his queen.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.486
Yes! Come.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.323
That was so much fun.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.075
- Yeah, right?
- Yes.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.953
- [exclaims] Whoa!
- [all gasping]

58:19.954 --> 58:21.956
You brought her to our place?

58:22.999 --> 58:26.168
Excuse me? "Our place"?

58:26.169 --> 58:29.255
This is the only bar in town, Olivia.
[laughs nervously]

58:30.256 --> 58:31.924
Did you know
she was gonna be here?

58:31.925 --> 58:34.676
What? No. No, of course not.

58:34.677 --> 58:39.348
I thought you were working so hard
that you deserved a little fun,

58:39.349 --> 58:42.184
because I'm a fun guy.

58:42.185 --> 58:43.519
Yeah.

58:46.272 --> 58:49.901
Do you really wanna
have fun, hmm?

58:53.613 --> 58:57.158
- Come on, scientist. You and me.
- Fun guy.

58:59.160 --> 59:02.037
[whistles]
Let the tejo begin.

59:02.038 --> 59:04.539
- [gun fires]
- Whoa! Whoa!

59:04.540 --> 59:07.000
No! Whoa! Whoa! Is that safe?

59:07.001 --> 59:10.337
Aw! Are you scared
of a little danger?

59:10.338 --> 59:11.421
No way.

59:11.422 --> 59:13.633
Everyone, look at this.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.054
[cheering]

59:21.015 --> 59:22.058
Time out.

59:23.518 --> 59:24.601
- Yes!
- [cheering]

59:24.602 --> 59:26.688
Come on, baseball.
Don't let me down.

59:31.025 --> 59:34.069
- [cheering]
- You quit?

59:34.070 --> 59:35.863
Just like Kobe.

59:37.699 --> 59:41.034
Winner, almost by default...

59:41.035 --> 59:43.412
- [gun firing]
- Olivia!

59:43.413 --> 59:46.331
[Olivia]
Who's the queen of the night?

59:46.332 --> 59:48.209
[music playing]

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:15.610
[music stops]

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.904
I didn't know you could dance.

01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:20.532
All Colombians can dance.

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:24.453
- Okay, my ama taught me.
- Aw, that's so cute.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.332
Diego, don't forget
the tradition.

01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:32.754
It's gonna be nice.

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:37.424
I thought you would
hate harvesting,

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:39.468
but you really put
your heart into it.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.971
Well, you know, I'm actually
happy you're making me do it.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:47.184
You work in a lab so long, you
forget where food even comes from.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:51.188
I was kind of hoping that this experience
would help me find a new idea, though.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.148
Hmm. Like the Glo-Nut.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.317
Exactly.

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.903
I was engaged too,

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:01.823
but he stole my idea and started a
whole Glo-Nut empire without me.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.992
I've seen you work, Zoe.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:07.746
The next big idea will come.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:13.585
Hey, I've never seen a scientist
work so hard at farming.

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:15.504
[both laugh]

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.924
You know, at first, I just wanted
to get the hell out of there.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:22.845
But I really appreciate everything
you've been showing me.

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:29.685
I think we're making some
really good coffee together.

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:35.440
But honestly,

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:39.194
do you think Americans
will like the flavor?

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.779
Uh, yeah.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.866
- Yeah, they'll like the flavors.
- Hmm.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:48.913
Hey, let's get out of here.
Come on.

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.709
[speaking Spanish]

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.295
- Bye.
- Gracias.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:25.699
Okay. From here, we walk.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.992
It's not too far.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:30.078
- You lead the way.
- Sure.

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.997
It's really nice
to see you so relaxed.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.624
[Zoe]
I was just thinking
the same about you.

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.419
[Diego] Careful.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:43.758
Oh, wow!

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.595
It's beautiful.

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:54.394
I know you have
only a few more days here,

01:02:54.395 --> 01:02:56.355
And I don't wanna
complicate anything for you.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.234
- But...
- Come here.

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:09.285
Oh, my god.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:11.453
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:14.456
That's one way to close a deal.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:18.877
What the hell are
you doing here, Olivia?

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:23.382
I won tonight,
so I'm here to claim my prize.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.220
I should, um...

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.429
I should go?

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:31.264
No, no, no. No. No.

01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:33.934
If anyone should go, it's her.

01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:35.519
Get out of my bed right now.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.980
Diego. Diego, please.

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.316
Calm down.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.443
I miss you.

01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:48.741
And, uh, I understand now
that we belong together.

01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:54.037
For years, you were
all I could think of,

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:55.997
but you cheated and left.

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:59.919
Now, I need to be
with someone who I can trust.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:04.130
I thought that we could talk.

01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:07.634
[skeptically]
Yeah, talk.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:11.805
Well, it's... It's late,
and it's very dark outside,

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:14.684
so maybe you can
give me a ride home.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.229
You can have
the other guest room.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:22.023
Okay. Fine.

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.193
I will sleep here.

01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:28.738
- Hey, I'm sorry about that.
- No, I'm sorry.

01:04:28.739 --> 01:04:32.577
No, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.538
Well...

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.332
it is getting late.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:40.626
Zoe.

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:44.630
I had really fun tonight.

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:48.384
Me, too.

01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:59.353
Oh, man! What am I doing?

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:07.778
[rooster crowing]

01:05:12.116 --> 01:05:14.075
[wincing]

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:17.371
It's like my hangover
is having a hangover.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.501
Okay.

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:25.670
[speaking Spanish]

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:30.008
I cut up some of your
favorite fruit this morning.

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:31.718
Thank you. Um...

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:34.638
I don't think I'm ready
to eat just yet.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:37.682
Uh, can I please use
your computer again?

01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:39.894
Of course. Of course.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.564
[sighs exasperatedly]

01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:52.906
[Skype call ringing]

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:54.741
[Gobbs]
There's my Kreme Queen.

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.451
What's up, ladies?

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.203
Sir, I have to talk to you.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.788
Peep this, yo.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:04.084
Cinnalicious, the taste
be so licious.

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.336
Grab a cup. Suck it down.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.880
It's so hashtag licious.

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:11.132
Hashtag delicious?

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:13.551
[Gobbs]
For the drink, yo.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.303
Can you believe
no one has used it yet?

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:18.556
Sir, we can't use these beans
for Cinnalicious.

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:19.766
Sorry. What?

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.851
[Zoe]
The coffee farmer who runs this place,

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:25.939
he's only selling to us because he
thinks we're selling these beans as-is.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:31.569
Now, these are hand-picked, hand-split,
hand-dried, even hand-roasted beans, sir.

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:33.029
They're perfect.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:35.949
And he didn't wanna see such
high quality be bulldozed over

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.659
by one of our test-tube flavors.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.828
No, but this is the flavor.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.996
[stammering]
This is the Flavor of the Year.

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:45.834
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to agree with him.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.670
We can't use these beans
for Cinnalicious.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.547
I do wanna use them
for something else, though.

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:53.466
I'll go back to Medellín and find
some other beans we can use,

01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:54.968
but not these.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:57.137
Absolutely not.
We launch next week.

01:06:57.138 --> 01:07:00.557
We're already running
commercials for these beans.

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.601
Oh! No! No! What have I done?

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:07.940
What if I don't get
these beans for Cinnalicious?

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.820
[Gobbs]
Then you're fired.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:25.623
- Zoe.
- Hey.

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:28.294
- I have to tell you something.
- I have to tell you something.

01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:31.171
- You first.
- Okay.

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:37.051
Um, I wanted to apologize again
for what happened last night.

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:39.053
And say that...

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:40.889
I'm going to miss you.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.433
I don't know
what the future holds.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:45.935
I know we'll be far apart.

01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:48.229
But whatever happens...

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:51.024
I'm glad to have met you,

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:55.613
and I really hope
we can work something out.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.742
I really hope
we can work something out too.

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:04.497
Really, really hoping.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:07.957
- [sighs]
- Hey.

01:08:07.958 --> 01:08:10.586
So, what is it
you wanted to tell me?

01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:17.259
I am going to make
the perfect roast today.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.984
[speaking Spanish]

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.479
Juanita.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:36.337
[Zoe]
I tell him.

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:37.881
I tell him not.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:39.966
I tell him.

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.719
I tell him not.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.054
What...

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:46.348
Perfect.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.809
[laughs]

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:02.488
The color of soil
after it rains.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:05.201
The color of soil
after it rains.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.412
Diego!

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.374
Whoo! Diego!

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.919
Diego?

01:10:16.253 --> 01:10:17.630
Diego?

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:22.801
Diego!

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.222
Diego!

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:29.807
- Jorge, is that...
- [braying]

01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:31.184
Peaberry?

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:32.435
Peaberry!

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:35.563
You have been quite the
heart-breaker, you know that?

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:41.319
I know someone who is going to be
very, very excited to see you.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.822
Caturra! Jorge!

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.868
Oh, yeah! Where is it?

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:50.745
Oh, Peaberry!

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:53.122
Oh, my baby!

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:55.833
I missed you so much.

01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:57.085
Oh!

01:10:57.086 --> 01:11:00.672
I missed your hips.
Look at this!

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.590
My baby!
What's all that?

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:05.051
I finally made
the perfect roast.

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:06.303
You?

01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:09.181
Let me see.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.435
Ah! Perfect!

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:16.312
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:19.107
You know who is going
to be very proud?

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.191
- Diego.
- Yeah.

01:11:20.192 --> 01:11:21.651
Do you know where he is?

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:25.029
- Um, I think...
- Thank you.

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.782
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:29.034
Diego!

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.495
Diego!

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.581
Diego, I...

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:42.714
- [Zoe] Oh, my god!
- [Olivia] [mockingly] Oh, my god!

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.758
I knew she couldn't be trusted.

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:50.722
So, this is what
my beans are destined for?

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.599
How could you lie to me?

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:56.270
I am so sorry.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.647
I lied to you,

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:02.483
but I was going
to tell you the truth.

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:03.818
You're right.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:08.156
Using your beans in Cinnalicious
would be a travesty.

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.700
- But I think you should do it anyway.
- What?

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:12.244
It'll save the farm.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.372
Hopefully, I can talk them in
to selling the beans as-is,

01:12:16.373 --> 01:12:18.082
or maybe you can find
another buyer,

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:22.336
but if not, the Dancing
Goat will still be yours.

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:26.924
I know you don't want that warehouse
full of beans to go to waste.

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:29.218
They're going to waste
right now.

01:12:29.219 --> 01:12:33.474
Using them in Cinnalicious is actually...
It's a good thing.

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.561
I'm just sorry
you had to find out this way.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.482
I was going to tell you.

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.070
Say something.

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:49.280
Please, Diego, anything.

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:52.785
I don't need Star Kreme
to save this place.

01:12:58.248 --> 01:12:59.750
We're getting married.

01:13:01.418 --> 01:13:03.503
The engagement is back on.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:08.384
We're going to merge our two
farms as we always intended.

01:13:10.594 --> 01:13:11.678
Diego.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.015
You should go.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.519
I already called you a taxi.

01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:07.233
[Juanita]
Zoe? Zoe.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:11.029
Juanita, I am so, so sorry.

01:14:12.072 --> 01:14:13.198
No, don't...

01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:15.868
We will miss you.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:23.208
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:45.606
[speaking Spanish]

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:34.488
[telephone ringing]

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.579
Hi, Mr. Gobbs.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.916
I can't believe
you still have a landline.

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:49.294
Uh, sir...

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.463
I didn't get the deal.

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:53.923
[Gobbs on telephone]
I know.

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:55.883
I'm so, so sorry.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.510
This isn't some small "oops."

01:15:57.511 --> 01:16:00.304
We had to push the launch of
Cinnalicious to source another vendor.

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:03.225
Our entire advertising campaign
had to be scrapped.

01:16:04.768 --> 01:16:06.227
You're fired.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.854
Make sure you
turn in your badge.

01:16:19.574 --> 01:16:22.577
Diego, Juanita, look.

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:25.288
Peaberry's not eating.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:28.749
- What happened?
- I don't know what's going on.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.668
- Peaberry.
- Baby.

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:31.753
Hi.

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:35.215
She's not eating?

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:45.099
[exclaiming in Spanish]

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.185
- What?
- I think she's pregnant.

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:49.937
What?

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.939
She's pregnant.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.442
- Oh, beauty.
- Oh, my baby.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:56.278
Who did this to you?

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.614
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.992
Oh, my god. She's pregnant.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:05.411
Eww, that... is back.

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:07.748
- Stay away!
- I'm staying away.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.962
Diego, change that face, huh?

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:19.343
I'm sorry she
hurt you like that.

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.136
Yeah, me too.

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:24.681
Now we just have to
look to the future.

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:33.230
You know, why don't we go to my
parents' house to see the farm?

01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:35.650
I'm sure they're gonna
love to see you.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.867
Maybe I'll get a cat.

01:17:44.951 --> 01:17:46.953
No. No.

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.749
I'm such an idiot.

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.170
No, I'm not an idiot.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.882
I'm not an idiot.

01:17:59.883 --> 01:18:01.884
Cherry skins.

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:02.969
Yes!

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:20.987
So, do you like it?

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:27.035
Well, uh, your parents
have made a lot of changes.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:30.288
Let the tour continue.

01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:42.174
Look, now what we do is we just
drop the beans into these driers,

01:18:42.175 --> 01:18:43.593
and that's it.

01:18:45.303 --> 01:18:47.806
Now we have time
to do other stuff.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.933
Other stuff?

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:52.143
Yeah.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.228
What other stuff?

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:56.480
Anything that we want.

01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:58.692
We're not tied to
this place anymore.

01:19:15.959 --> 01:19:17.961
[sighs]

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:30.182
[inhales]

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.601
The perfect roast.

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:51.953
Please work.
Please work.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.289
Yes!

01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.961
You have barely said anything.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.965
I've been thinking.

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.592
Mm-hmm, and?

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:10.137
And I think we are rushing this.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.181
Why are you saying that?

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:15.643
Olivia, we cannot just pick up
where we left off.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.270
Of course we can.
We will make it work.

01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:22.483
The designer you left me for,
he dumped you.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.110
Let's just say that his preferred
blend was light and fruity.

01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:29.407
Okay. Well, I don't want to be
anyone's second choice.

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:32.744
So, that's it?

01:20:33.703 --> 01:20:35.413
What about the wedding?

01:20:37.457 --> 01:20:39.834
What's going to happen
with the farm?

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:43.463
I've decided to sell
to Star Kreme.

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:47.007
For Cinnalicious?

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.176
You're not going to be able
to sleep at night.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:53.305
They can use the beans for
whatever they want. I don't care.

01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:55.015
I can always grow more.

01:20:55.016 --> 01:21:00.855
So you're finally sacrificing the
famous Valdez pride for money?

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:06.862
You will never understand.

01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:27.007
No way.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:35.557
Oh.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.601
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:40.812
Yes!

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:46.817
Hmpf.

01:21:46.818 --> 01:21:50.654
[speaking Spanish]

01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:52.781
Tia, get Siri on your phone.

01:21:52.782 --> 01:21:55.451
I need your lap pad
to scan myself a plane ticket.

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:57.911
What? None of what you said
was correct.

01:21:57.912 --> 01:22:03.000
Tia, as you say,
people make mistakes.

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:05.878
Mine was to let Zoe go.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:06.962
Yeah.

01:22:06.963 --> 01:22:08.756
Okay, so...

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:11.091
Mmm, that button.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.551
- This one?
- No, the other one.

01:22:12.552 --> 01:22:13.594
No. Yeah.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:16.472
By the way, where's Olivia?

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:17.848
Uh...

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:20.352
- The warehouse is on fire! Come on.
- What?

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:22.854
Wait.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.276
Our beans!

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:40.288
[screams]

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:49.963
[crying]

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.382
I'm sorry.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.633
I'm sorry, Tia.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.969
Oh, my god!

01:22:56.012 --> 01:22:59.973
I guess you cannot sell
to Star Kreme after all.

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:02.685
Olivia, what have you done?

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:03.811
Nothing.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:06.647
Nothing. I'm very sad about it.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.316
I want to help how ever I can.

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:15.614
Um, you know, uh, I still think
that I can save the farm.

01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:18.660
Do you remember
what you gave me?

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:22.246
Of course I remember.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:24.415
Well, you can give it

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.584
to your cell wife in jail!

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:33.925
Yes.

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:36.343
Yes!

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:38.096
Okay.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.390
All right.

01:23:44.769 --> 01:23:46.687
Uh, security!

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:47.855
Give me five minutes.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.648
What're you doing?
You were fired, remember?

01:23:49.649 --> 01:23:53.110
I've come up
with a million-dollar idea.

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:56.613
Make that
a multimillion-dollar idea.

01:23:56.614 --> 01:23:58.241
Multimillion...

01:23:59.659 --> 01:24:00.702
It's okay.

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:07.041
I... am listening.

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:12.629
- Taste this.
- Oh, no.

01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:16.008
Last time a fired employee gave me a
drink, I had dysentery for weeks.

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:17.801
No, thank you.
Lesson learned.

01:24:17.802 --> 01:24:21.722
Believe me, if I wanted to poison you,
I wouldn't have shown up in person.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:22.849
Here, look.

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:26.728
All right, give me.

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:34.611
Effervescent.

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.113
Fruity.

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.741
Complex.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:45.078
Invigorating.
This is the best artisanal
soda I have ever tasted.

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:47.790
No, it's not just
an artisanal soda.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.958
It's an artisanal energy drink.

01:24:49.959 --> 01:24:52.503
- Wait a minute. So you added caffeine?
- No.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:53.754
It's all natural.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.339
It's made from coffee cherries.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.132
Look at this.

01:24:57.133 --> 01:25:00.344
It turns out there's actually more caffeine
in the skin than there is in the bean.

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:02.722
It is 100 percent organic.

01:25:04.724 --> 01:25:05.891
That's brilliant.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:07.810
Forget about turning in
your badge.

01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:10.854
I will have your
new lab ready in no time.

01:25:10.855 --> 01:25:15.860
I think this recipe is worth
a lot more than a new lab.

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:19.364
And the next flight to Medellín?

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.449
Perfect.

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:24.868
- Your plane ticket.
- Okay.

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:27.913
There's only a flight per day,
so don't miss it.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:32.084
It lands at 2:00, and then it
leaves at 3:00 to Medellín.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:33.460
Okay.

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.420
I'm very proud of you, Diego.

01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:38.424
And I know su papa
y su mama tambien.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.389
Go find her.

01:25:58.361 --> 01:25:59.946
My passport.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.575
[exclaims in Spanish]

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:18.131
It's good to be back.

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.012
Okay.

01:26:43.656 --> 01:26:45.950
- I missed it.
- Missed what?

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.371
What?

01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:53.708
I cannot believe you're here.

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.835
I was about to fly and find you.

01:26:56.836 --> 01:26:58.212
You were?

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:01.716
I ended it with Olivia.

01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:04.635
I want to be with you.

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:06.762
I came to win you back.

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:09.556
I told Olivia
how I feel about you.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.558
She burned down the warehouse.

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:13.560
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:16.104
I was going to
sell to Star Kreme.

01:27:16.105 --> 01:27:18.106
I didn't want you
to lose your job.

01:27:18.107 --> 01:27:19.484
But now...

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.653
I have to sell the Dancing Goat.

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:24.154
No.

01:27:24.155 --> 01:27:26.282
No, no. What if I could...

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:31.328
What if I could pay you double
for your next harvest?

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:33.038
In advance.

01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:36.166
Please, no jokes right now.

01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:37.501
I am serious.

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:41.171
Now, you sell us the coffee
beans and the cherry skins.

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:45.301
We're going into production on the world's
first ever artisanal energy drink.

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:48.304
I named it Peaberry's Secret.

01:27:52.475 --> 01:27:53.601
I love you.

01:27:54.602 --> 01:27:56.270
I love you too.

01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:17.499
I'm going to tell you something.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.334
If you hurt her,

01:28:19.335 --> 01:28:22.546
I'm gonna make longaniza
from you, okay?

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:24.132
I know it was you.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.470
Hm.
