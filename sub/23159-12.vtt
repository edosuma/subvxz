WEBVTT

00:00.073 --> 00:03.531
I've got to talk to you, please,
before I go crazy.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.340
I'm sorry. My relationship with Karen
isn't for the press.

00:10.383 --> 00:13.216
- Nurses aren't meant to become doctors.
- Come on.

00:13.252 --> 00:15.049
The board voted to suspend me.

00:15.088 --> 00:18.057
Accept what happened
no matter how painful that may be.

00:18.725 --> 00:22.092
Magnum, you keep sticking your nose in
where it doesn't belong.

00:22.128 --> 00:24.494
Thomas, what is wrong with me?

00:24.530 --> 00:27.693
You hassle Karen again,
anywhere, anytime, you answer to me.

00:27.734 --> 00:29.929
- Is that a threat?
- You bet.

03:06.859 --> 03:09.293
Hey, Magnum. Wait up.

03:10.830 --> 03:12.593
Oh. Are you OK?

03:12.632 --> 03:15.226
Yeah. I don't know
about the guy I came in with.

03:15.268 --> 03:18.726
Don't worry.
We don't let them off that easy.

03:19.438 --> 03:22.407
- Or you either.
- Me?

03:22.441 --> 03:25.774
Yeah. Do you remember
a little poker game in Danang?

03:25.811 --> 03:28.473
You owe me $20. Pay up.

03:28.514 --> 03:30.345
Karen, I'm wounded.

03:30.383 --> 03:34.615
This is superficial, hardly worth
a Purple Heart. Now pay up.

03:35.321 --> 03:38.154
Well, I thought T.C. owed it to you.

03:38.191 --> 03:41.490
T.C.? I don't even know anyone named T.C.

03:41.527 --> 03:45.224
- I know you, and you owe me $20. Now pay.
- Karen.

03:45.264 --> 03:48.722
I don't carry cash around with me
when I go into combat.

03:50.136 --> 03:54.505
You welshers always have some wonderful
excuse for not paying off gambling debts.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.906
- I'm not a welsher.
- Yes, you are.

03:56.943 --> 03:59.377
And if you don't pay me next time I see you,

03:59.412 --> 04:02.973
I'm gonna spread it all over South Vietnam
and North Vietnam

04:03.015 --> 04:05.245
that you welsh on your gambling debts.

04:05.284 --> 04:07.479
- I'm not a welsher.
- Goodbye, Thomas.

04:10.756 --> 04:12.485
I'm not a welsher!

04:24.303 --> 04:26.168
Is everything OK?

04:33.346 --> 04:35.541
Hi, soldier. How are you doing?

04:35.581 --> 04:37.572
I'm all right, I guess.

04:37.617 --> 04:40.780
- I'm a little scared.
- I'm sure you are.

04:40.820 --> 04:46.452
It's only natural. You're gonna be fine.
I've looked at your chart. Everything's...

04:50.529 --> 04:53.054
Nurse! Nurse! Nurse.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.760
I'm here. I won't leave you.
I won't. I'm here.

05:24.997 --> 05:26.965
- Karen?
- Over here.

05:26.999 --> 05:29.467
- Come here and help me with this kid.
- Come on.

05:32.038 --> 05:34.029
Karen, he's dead. Come on.

05:34.073 --> 05:36.371
Come on. Let's go.

05:50.623 --> 05:54.582
Step lively, men.
The sun is going to be high and hot soon.

05:54.627 --> 05:59.223
Isn't a new athletic field for the Waimanalo
Children's Center a worthy cause?

05:59.265 --> 06:00.857
Quite worthy.

06:00.900 --> 06:05.098
Then why do we have to build this doghouse
to hold this fundraiser on the estate?

06:06.539 --> 06:09.872
Because that is the deal
that Magnum negotiated.

06:09.909 --> 06:12.844
You mean you would have
held the dance here anyway?

06:14.146 --> 06:17.047
- Of course.
- I'm gonna kill him.

06:17.083 --> 06:21.144
- You're gonna have to stand in line.
- Oh, stop your carping.

06:21.187 --> 06:25.590
This is a unique opportunity
to reproduce a 14th-century structure.

06:25.624 --> 06:29.890
I found these blueprints in
the rare manuscript vault at the university.

06:29.929 --> 06:32.591
They're the plans drawn up
by the Duke of Cheltenham

06:32.631 --> 06:34.292
for a royal house 600 years ago.

06:34.333 --> 06:38.667
Dobermans are German. Maybe an English
doghouse isn't such a hot idea, Higgins.

06:38.704 --> 06:42.071
The lads appreciate the finer things.
They'll be ecstatic.

06:42.108 --> 06:46.101
We'd like to have a word with you.
I don't need to do no talking.

06:46.145 --> 06:49.911
- You guys see the paper today?
- Give us the box scores while we work.

06:49.949 --> 06:51.883
I'm serious. Did you see this?

06:54.420 --> 06:56.945
So? What does this have to do
with the fundraiser?

06:56.989 --> 07:01.483
That's Karen Harmon. She was with the
71st evac hospital at Bin Thuy, remember?

07:02.728 --> 07:04.889
- No.
- I never made it down to Bin Thuy.

07:04.930 --> 07:07.398
Hey, Thomas.
Higgins said we don't have to...

07:07.433 --> 07:11.733
- I say, Magnum, where are you going?
- You aren't running out on us, are you?

07:11.771 --> 07:16.071
<i>We all have people in our lives
we believe in, regardless of what happens.</i>

07:16.108 --> 07:19.737
<i>Karen was one of those.
Although I hadn't seen her since Nam,</i>

07:19.779 --> 07:23.806
<i>I still remember the look in her eyes
the day that young soldier died.</i>

07:23.849 --> 07:26.340
<i>It was like a little part of her had died too</i>.

07:26.385 --> 07:29.115
No answers.
Dr. Harmon won't talk to anyone today.

07:29.155 --> 07:31.953
Does being a woman
have anything to do with this?

07:31.991 --> 07:36.155
If you were sitting on the board of directors,
who would you suspect?

07:36.195 --> 07:40.529
I'm not answering questions.
There'll be a statement another time.

07:48.274 --> 07:50.834
Did being a woman
have anything to do with this?

07:50.876 --> 07:54.243
She is not gonna answer
any of your questions today.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.078
The U.S. President answers
more questions than she has.

07:57.116 --> 08:00.017
I won't say it again.
This lady's been through a lot.

08:00.052 --> 08:04.682
Do you understand me? The public
has a right to know when I wanna tell 'em.

08:04.723 --> 08:07.055
I'd like to find out...
Thomas.

08:07.092 --> 08:10.220
- Let me ask you this...
- I'm not answering questions either.

08:10.262 --> 08:13.390
If she was on the board,
who would she point the finger at?

08:13.432 --> 08:16.959
I'm gonna point my finger at you
if you don't cut this out.

08:18.370 --> 08:21.703
- No more questions.
- What is your relationship to the doctor?

08:21.740 --> 08:23.970
What is your relationship to the doctor?

08:32.217 --> 08:35.210
Thomas, do you remember Nam
when the B-52s would hit?

08:35.254 --> 08:40.385
One minute, nothing. And then the ground
shook so hard it knocked you off your feet.

08:40.426 --> 08:43.190
That's how it was at the hospital yesterday.

08:43.229 --> 08:46.221
Three surgical patients of mine
had died in a month.

08:46.265 --> 08:50.895
It bothered me but I knew I wasn't
responsible. It's happened to other doctors.

08:51.770 --> 08:54.762
I knew that I hadn't made any mistakes.

08:54.807 --> 08:58.368
They did an autopsy on Mrs. Jorgenson
and found digoxin in her blood.

08:58.410 --> 09:03.006
So they autopsy the other two that died, find
digoxin and suddenly I'm a murder suspect.

09:03.048 --> 09:06.279
It's ridiculous. I mean,
Karen could never kill anybody.

09:06.318 --> 09:11.312
Tell that to those reporters. Tell it to
the police or the directors at the hospital.

09:11.357 --> 09:14.019
- I'm as good as convicted in their eyes.
- Karen.

09:14.059 --> 09:17.187
Anybody who knows you
isn't gonna believe that.

09:17.229 --> 09:20.255
Don't be so sure of that, Thomas,
I'm a female surgeon.

09:20.299 --> 09:22.995
That's strike one to a lot of people.

09:23.035 --> 09:28.803
Also, I'm a nurse. Nurses aren't supposed
to become doctors. Strike two.

09:31.110 --> 09:33.977
And all three of those patients were mine.

09:34.813 --> 09:38.943
- Strike three.
- Come on. That doesn't prove anything.

09:38.984 --> 09:43.284
Well, apparently it does, Thomas.
The entire board voted to suspend me.

09:43.322 --> 09:46.621
Except for Phillip Harriman,
the chief administrator.

09:46.659 --> 09:48.752
I hear that he fought for me.

09:48.794 --> 09:52.252
They are just a bunch of cowards
trying to save their own necks

09:52.298 --> 09:54.061
and sacrificing Karen to do it.

09:55.801 --> 09:58.599
- Well, maybe I can help.
- How?

09:59.638 --> 10:02.038
Well, I am a private investigator.

10:02.074 --> 10:06.738
How will the reporters react when they
find out she's hired a private investigator?

10:06.779 --> 10:11.273
- I didn't say anything about hiring.
- You guys aren't known for working for free.

10:11.317 --> 10:14.411
- Robert, Thomas is my friend.
- You are my fiancÃ©e.

10:15.721 --> 10:19.282
We appreciate you coming by, Magnum,
but I can handle this.

10:20.759 --> 10:23.557
- Robert.
- Quietly.

10:25.864 --> 10:27.161
Karen?

10:34.640 --> 10:36.403
Thank you, Thomas.

10:36.442 --> 10:38.171
We'll work it out.

10:41.580 --> 10:46.040
<i>I know what you're thinking, Robert and
Karen were clear about not wanting my help</i>

10:46.085 --> 10:47.916
<i>and it wasn't any of my business,</i>

10:47.953 --> 10:52.754
<i>so why not spend my time enjoying the
fringes that come from living in paradise?</i>

10:52.791 --> 10:56.488
<i>The problem is I'm always a sucker
for all those trite sayings like.</i>

10:56.528 --> 10:58.587
<i>"A friend in need is a friend indeed"</i>.

10:58.631 --> 11:02.294
<i>Right now Karen was in need
and could use all the friends she could get,</i>

11:02.334 --> 11:03.961
<i>whether she realized it or not</i>.

11:04.003 --> 11:06.597
I'm sorry, Mr. Magnum. I can't help you.

11:06.639 --> 11:10.200
Mr. Harriman, Karen said you were
the only one who fought for her. Why?

11:10.242 --> 11:13.541
- Because I think she's innocent.
- Who do you think is guilty?

11:13.579 --> 11:17.743
I'm sorry. The police and our lawyers
have told me to say nothing about that.

11:17.783 --> 11:21.947
Well, someone's saying something.
Or don't you read the papers?

11:21.987 --> 11:25.081
Of course I read the papers,
and I hate everything I see.

11:25.124 --> 11:26.819
<i>Dr. Stern to Radiology</i>.

11:26.859 --> 11:31.626
Well, tell me this. Who's this Dr. Jorgenson
who got this whole thing going?

11:31.664 --> 11:35.361
He's a surgeon here.
His wife was the last patient to die.

11:35.401 --> 11:38.996
The other two victims
were a lawyer named Cox...

11:39.038 --> 11:42.166
And a tourist
with an emergency appendectomy.

11:43.409 --> 11:46.071
I'm sorry. That's all I'm gonna say about this.

11:46.912 --> 11:51.110
Look. Nobody wants to help Karen more
than I do, but I have a hospital to run,

11:51.150 --> 11:56.247
a board of directors to answer to, and a staff
of nearly 700 people I'm responsible for.

11:56.288 --> 11:58.848
These murders could ruin us.

11:58.891 --> 12:01.382
What do you think they're doing to Karen?

12:02.261 --> 12:05.594
<i>Mr. Harriman, Mr. Phillip Harriman,
telephone, please.</i>

12:05.631 --> 12:07.462
I'm sorry.

12:28.821 --> 12:31.187
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hi.

12:31.223 --> 12:33.953
Eric Daniels, Honolulu Dispatch.
I'm a reporter.

12:33.992 --> 12:37.723
I was just admiring your car. Wow.

12:37.763 --> 12:42.666
Listen. I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if I might, about Karen Harmon.

12:42.701 --> 12:47.104
I'm sorry. My relationship with Karen
isn't for the press.

12:47.139 --> 12:50.666
I'm sorry to hear that. I'd hate
to look elsewhere for speculation,

12:50.709 --> 12:52.973
especially why she hired an investigator.

12:53.011 --> 12:55.377
She didn't hire me. We're friends.

12:55.414 --> 12:57.507
You met in Nam, right?

12:59.017 --> 13:02.919
Uh, look, Magnum, is it?
I traced you through this car of yours,

13:02.955 --> 13:04.786
or should I say Robin Masters'.

13:04.823 --> 13:07.257
I did a little digging. You know reporters.

13:07.292 --> 13:08.919
I'm learning.

13:10.295 --> 13:12.422
Nam must have been pretty rough, huh?

13:12.464 --> 13:15.194
Especially on a woman like Karen.

13:15.234 --> 13:18.692
- What's your point, Daniels?
- Karen was a nurse. Was she a good one?

13:22.207 --> 13:26.337
The best. She worked round the clock, six,
seven days a week. Saved a lot of lives.

13:26.378 --> 13:29.779
- Maybe you ought to write about that.
- Maybe I will.

13:29.815 --> 13:31.476
Just one more question, please.

13:31.517 --> 13:35.647
So you're saying it was as rough on the
nurses as it was for you guys on the line?

13:35.687 --> 13:40.351
Maybe rougher. See, all they could do was
pick up the pieces. We could fight back.

13:41.126 --> 13:44.027
I guess it had to tear them up inside.

13:44.062 --> 13:46.530
It tore us all up. Bye.

13:46.565 --> 13:50.057
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much. Pleasure.

13:50.769 --> 13:51.997
Beautiful car.

13:52.037 --> 13:54.232
You're weird.

14:12.324 --> 14:16.021
<i>I spent the rest of the afternoon
tracing the three murder victims.</i>

14:16.061 --> 14:18.188
<i>The lawyer was well-known in Honolulu</i>

14:18.230 --> 14:22.326
<i>and had been defending a union leader
on trial for misappropriating union funds</i>

14:22.367 --> 14:23.994
<i>when his gallbladder kicked up</i>.

14:24.036 --> 14:27.870
<i>Now the union leader would get a new trial.
I put Rick on that one.</i>

14:27.906 --> 14:32.502
<i>The tourist with the appendectomy was
a used car salesman from Philadelphia.</i>

14:32.544 --> 14:36.344
<i>Unless someone was very upset
with a '72 Chevy he sold them,</i>

14:36.381 --> 14:39.544
<i>I couldn't figure a reason
for anyone murdering him.</i>

14:39.585 --> 14:42.145
<i>But I asked Rick to check that one too</i>.

14:42.187 --> 14:45.918
<i>Dr. Jorgenson had flown back
to the mainland to bury his wife.</i>

14:45.958 --> 14:49.394
<i>He was due in today
and I decided to check him myself.</i>

14:49.428 --> 14:51.658
<i>Well, I couldn't give them all to Rick</i>.

14:52.931 --> 14:55.297
Swimming in the rain, I see.

14:56.101 --> 14:58.365
Rather energetic for this kind of weather.

14:58.403 --> 15:00.769
I hope you haven't got it into your head

15:00.806 --> 15:04.003
to try out for the Iron Man competition again.

15:04.042 --> 15:05.566
No.

15:06.812 --> 15:09.280
Higgins, do you know a Dr. Jorgenson?

15:10.682 --> 15:15.312
A Dr. Jorgenson applied for membership at
the King Kamehameha club a while ago.

15:15.354 --> 15:17.549
Nearly a year back as I recall.

15:17.589 --> 15:23.084
I was interim chairman after Corky Foxworth
had been persuaded to step down.

15:23.128 --> 15:26.962
Well, not persuaded, really.
He was removed.

15:26.999 --> 15:29.024
And not a moment too soon, either.

15:29.067 --> 15:32.434
The man had absolutely
no sense of quality or style

15:32.471 --> 15:36.737
and hadn't made any effort to define
standards for evaluating applicants.

15:36.775 --> 15:40.711
Higgins, just fill me in
on what you know about Dr. Jorgenson!

15:40.746 --> 15:42.611
Does this have to do with Dr. Harmon?

15:45.617 --> 15:47.812
Perhaps you should look at this newspaper.

15:53.358 --> 15:56.156
Mr. Daniels quotes several sources,
Magnum.

15:56.194 --> 15:57.821
Including you.

16:08.922 --> 16:11.516
- I don't believe this.
- That's all out of context.

16:11.558 --> 16:14.891
- Why did you talk to him at all?
- I told you this would happen.

16:14.928 --> 16:17.624
Why didn't you tell me
you'd been a VA patient?

16:17.664 --> 16:22.158
Because it's not relevant. A lot of people
spent time in VA hospitals after Nam.

16:22.202 --> 16:24.830
- Thomas, you know that.
- Sure, but...

16:24.871 --> 16:29.331
They're not all off-the-wall loonies
like this article suggests with help from you.

16:29.375 --> 16:35.177
I mean if I'd known, I might have been able
to figure out what Daniels was fishing for.

16:35.215 --> 16:37.410
We didn't ask for your help, remember?

16:37.450 --> 16:40.146
Well, that's not the point now, is it?

16:41.054 --> 16:43.852
Who at the hospital
knew you'd been a VA patient?

16:43.890 --> 16:49.487
I don't know. All I know
is that I haven't slept for two nights,

16:49.529 --> 16:54.125
I jump every time my phone rings,
and I can't leave my own house.

16:54.167 --> 16:56.692
- This is worse than prison.
- Karen.

16:56.736 --> 16:58.397
Karen.

17:00.273 --> 17:03.367
That's great.
You've done your good deed for the day.

17:03.409 --> 17:05.877
Why don't you go play boy scouts
somewhere else?

17:05.912 --> 17:08.938
Robert, we're on the same side.

17:09.983 --> 17:11.746
The hell we are, Magnum.

17:25.165 --> 17:26.689
Daniels?

17:35.275 --> 17:36.606
Hello, Magnum.

17:36.643 --> 17:40.135
Where do you come off writing a story
like the one in today's paper?

17:40.180 --> 17:41.647
It's all the truth.

17:41.681 --> 17:43.581
The truth has nothing to do with it.

17:43.616 --> 17:47.416
You so-called investigative reporters
drape yourself in the flag,

17:47.453 --> 17:50.422
hide behind the First Amendment
and do whatever it takes.

17:50.456 --> 17:53.857
I'm sorry. That article was accurate,
including your quotes.

17:53.893 --> 17:56.691
- All taken out of context.
- They were your words.

17:56.729 --> 18:00.995
You made it look like I think she's some kind
of delayed-stress vet, a crazy killer.

18:01.034 --> 18:05.494
- I didn't say she was a killer.
- Well, you sure got the thought across.

18:05.538 --> 18:11.067
- You got a problem? Write to the editor.
- What the hell for? He's just like you.

18:11.110 --> 18:15.046
He's looking for stories to sell papers.
Who told you she'd been a VA patient?

18:17.083 --> 18:19.950
- Who told you? Who, Daniels?
- You should know better.

18:19.986 --> 18:23.183
- My sources are confidential.
- Who?

18:24.657 --> 18:28.149
Look. Reporters are a lot like
private investigators.

18:28.194 --> 18:32.824
We get paid to see what other people miss.
I can't guarantee you'll like what I find.

18:34.734 --> 18:38.693
Well, I'm not gonna get in a spitting contest
with a snake.

18:41.007 --> 18:44.807
You hassle Karen again, anywhere,
anytime, you're gonna answer to me.

18:45.778 --> 18:47.973
Excuse me. Is that a threat?

18:48.881 --> 18:50.439
You bet.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.655
As far as I know, Tiny Timmy
was happy with the way...

18:56.689 --> 18:58.179
Tiny Timmy?

18:58.224 --> 19:01.819
Tim Timaura's nickname.
He's the union boss that's in trouble.

19:01.861 --> 19:07.731
Anyway, Tiny Timmy was very, very happy
with the way his lawyer handled this case.

19:07.767 --> 19:12.431
- I don't think he would have had him hit.
- What about the used car salesman?

19:12.472 --> 19:15.236
That guy's got possibilities. He's also...

19:15.275 --> 19:17.675
Other side of the line. That'll be too short.

19:17.710 --> 19:20.941
He's also a number rackets guy.
And a collector.

19:20.980 --> 19:24.609
And it seems that he got his money
to come over here on this trip

19:24.651 --> 19:26.710
by dipping into the take from last week.

19:26.753 --> 19:29.688
That's what Ice Pick tells me.
He said he'd get back to me.

19:29.722 --> 19:31.451
How long?

19:33.159 --> 19:36.287
I tell you what. Why don't you take this,

19:36.329 --> 19:38.957
this and this?

19:38.998 --> 19:41.466
You take this over
and we'll speed it up, OK?

19:41.501 --> 19:43.264
Thanks.

19:43.303 --> 19:46.636
You know, Thomas. From what you said,

19:46.673 --> 19:49.665
I don't think this lady really wants your help.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.205
Rick, she's confused.

19:53.513 --> 19:57.711
- How do you know that she didn't do it?
- I just know, that's all.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.378
I don't know this lady,
but I tell you, I know Nam.

20:00.420 --> 20:04.823
People that were there didn't just walk away
and pretend that it didn't happen.

20:04.857 --> 20:07.985
Rick, she's under a lot of pressure
but she can handle it.

20:13.766 --> 20:15.825
I love it up here.

20:15.868 --> 20:18.098
It's so cool and open.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.499
Sure different from Nam.

20:23.176 --> 20:24.871
I hated it there.

20:25.778 --> 20:27.746
It wasn't easy to like.

20:28.881 --> 20:32.874
Yeah, but I went because I thought
I could help bring people back.

20:32.919 --> 20:36.082
And you did, Karen. A lot of them.

20:38.524 --> 20:41.186
Somehow I feel like I've forgotten me.

20:42.895 --> 20:47.628
Thomas, when I got back from Nam,
I just felt empty.

20:47.667 --> 20:51.967
There were no highs, no lows, no joy.
No regret.

20:52.004 --> 20:54.370
Just... just nothing.

20:56.075 --> 21:00.978
When I got to the VA hospital, that was good
for me because it gave me time to regroup.

21:02.081 --> 21:03.912
That helped.

21:04.784 --> 21:08.151
- And so did Phillip.
- Phillip?

21:08.187 --> 21:12.487
Phillip Harriman. He was working at the VA
hospital in San Diego when I got there.

21:14.494 --> 21:16.962
I needed somebody to talk to.

21:18.097 --> 21:20.497
And he didn't seem to mind listening.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.597
We got very close.

21:26.105 --> 21:28.801
One point, we were talking about marriage.

21:28.841 --> 21:30.069
What happened?

21:31.411 --> 21:35.142
Medical school for me
and a job in the islands for him.

21:36.883 --> 21:42.446
By the time I got my residency in Honolulu,
he wanted to start where we left off,

21:42.488 --> 21:44.149
but...

21:44.190 --> 21:45.817
it was over for me.

21:48.261 --> 21:50.695
Course, by that time there was Robert.

21:52.331 --> 21:55.323
Phillip never... He never understood.

21:58.805 --> 22:02.673
Good friends are very hard to find,
aren't they?

22:05.611 --> 22:07.374
Are you my friend, Thomas?

22:09.382 --> 22:11.407
I mean...

22:11.451 --> 22:13.476
really my friend?

22:15.455 --> 22:17.821
Of course I'm your friend, Karen.

22:18.825 --> 22:22.022
Oh, God, Thomas. What is wrong with me?

22:25.598 --> 22:31.503
You're just going through a tough time.
Anyone else would have fallen apart by now.

22:33.272 --> 22:37.072
I'm afraid that I am.

22:38.377 --> 22:40.368
I mean...

22:40.413 --> 22:42.779
I just want to cry all the time.

22:43.583 --> 22:47.610
Or else I want to curl up in a little ball...

22:49.589 --> 22:51.784
and have someone hold me.

22:52.859 --> 22:54.884
And tell me I'm all right.

22:56.529 --> 22:58.656
And that it's OK.

22:58.698 --> 23:00.359
And that...

23:10.776 --> 23:12.767
Karen, you're gonna be all right.

23:15.147 --> 23:17.172
I wish I believed that.

23:19.752 --> 23:22.016
And I wish you believed it.

23:32.331 --> 23:36.529
<i>You know, when it came right down to it,
I really didn't know Karen that well.</i>

23:36.569 --> 23:40.061
<i>It had been years since I'd seen her in Nam.
I knew she'd changed.</i>

23:40.106 --> 23:42.734
<i>We all had. The question was how</i>.

23:42.775 --> 23:45.801
<i>I needed an update
from someone who knew Dr. Harmon,</i>

23:45.845 --> 23:48.473
<i>who'd worked with her
and seen her under pressure.</i>

23:48.514 --> 23:52.746
<i>Phil Harriman hadn't been willing to say
much. I was hoping Dr. Jorgenson might.</i>

23:53.953 --> 23:56.478
Dr. Jorgenson. I'm Thomas Magnum.

23:56.522 --> 24:00.891
I'm a friend of Karen Harmon's and I came
to find out what happened at the hospital.

24:02.194 --> 24:04.628
Would you give us a couple of seconds?

24:06.432 --> 24:10.266
I'm afraid I don't have a very objective
attitude about that, Mr. Magnum.

24:11.470 --> 24:14.371
You demanded an autopsy, Doctor. Why?

24:15.141 --> 24:17.735
Because my wife died. That's why.

24:17.777 --> 24:21.042
She went into hospital a fit woman
who needed a hysterectomy.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.548
One day later, she's dead.

24:25.718 --> 24:29.279
Look, I know
that had to come as a shock to you,

24:29.322 --> 24:31.984
but being a doctor,
you know those things happen.

24:32.024 --> 24:34.788
Now, what would make you suspect
that it was murder?

24:34.827 --> 24:38.763
I didn't. I assumed Dr. Harmon
or the anesthesiologist screwed up.

24:38.798 --> 24:43.497
I went half crazy, thinking if I could have
performed the operation or assisted,

24:43.536 --> 24:45.936
she'd still be alive.

24:45.972 --> 24:50.306
I'll be honest with you. At first,
all I wanted was my pound of flesh.

24:50.343 --> 24:53.676
An eye for an eye.
That's when I requested the autopsy.

24:55.014 --> 24:58.916
When they found digoxin in her blood,
I had this feeling of relief.

24:58.951 --> 25:03.354
Because I couldn't have prevented her
death, not if Dr. Harmon murdered her.

25:04.457 --> 25:08.052
Dr. Jorgenson,
Karen hasn't even been charged.

25:08.094 --> 25:09.891
Look. Three people have died.

25:09.929 --> 25:13.831
Karen Harmon was the surgeon
and attending physician for all of them.

25:13.866 --> 25:16.494
People are also innocent until proven guilty.

25:16.535 --> 25:20.062
I've lost the best friend I ever had.

25:20.106 --> 25:24.634
It's hard to just sit and wait for justice.

25:26.345 --> 25:30.679
I don't think convicting an innocent person
is gonna serve justice, Doctor.

25:52.538 --> 25:57.066
Dr. Harmon? I'm glad I caught you.
I wanted to talk to you before you left.

25:58.010 --> 26:00.672
I've been talking to a friend of yours,
Mr. Magnum.

26:00.713 --> 26:04.240
- Thomas?
- He said some things that...

26:04.283 --> 26:06.774
Well, they sunk in.

26:06.819 --> 26:10.778
I realize there's nothing I can do
that'll bring Marion back.

26:12.358 --> 26:17.318
No doctor plans to lose a patient,
but mistakes are made.

26:17.363 --> 26:20.730
Errors in judgment occur.
We know it can happen to any one of us.

26:20.766 --> 26:23.200
We dread the day that it might.

26:24.170 --> 26:27.970
Dr. Jorgenson, I didn't make any mistakes.

26:29.175 --> 26:33.168
When mistakes are made...

26:33.212 --> 26:36.545
I don't think anyone suffers more
than the doctor responsible.

26:36.582 --> 26:39.483
I know I'd have a terrible time
ever forgiving myself.

26:39.518 --> 26:43.045
I'm not responsible for your wife's death.

26:43.089 --> 26:46.650
Karen,
she was given an overdose of digoxin.

26:46.692 --> 26:52.597
I'm sure it wasn't intentional. I'm trying
very hard to accept that, to believe it.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.795
And to forgive you.

26:55.835 --> 26:59.566
And I think you have to do the same thing.
You have to accept what happened,

26:59.605 --> 27:01.630
no matter how painful that may be.

27:03.476 --> 27:06.104
Accept it or you'll never forgive yourself.

27:17.323 --> 27:18.347
Nurse!

27:20.226 --> 27:21.818
<i>Help mel.</i>

27:24.163 --> 27:25.858
Nurse!

27:30.603 --> 27:34.095
Higgins, this doghouse
will take longer to build than the pyramids.

27:34.140 --> 27:39.339
- How come you didn't bring a power saw?
- Power tools didn't exist in the 14th century.

27:39.378 --> 27:41.312
Why can't we use nails?

27:41.347 --> 27:44.646
Everything's peg and leather.
Not one nail in the structure.

27:44.683 --> 27:46.116
Peg and leather?

27:46.152 --> 27:50.316
Yeah, I guess they didn't use nails
in the 14th century either.

27:55.561 --> 28:01.466
Keep up the good work. This is something
you'll be proud to tell your grandchildren.

28:05.871 --> 28:08.999
This walking stick
was given to me by Monty himself

28:09.041 --> 28:10.906
after our campaign in Sicily.

28:32.932 --> 28:36.891
Hey, man. This dance was your idea
to raise money for the athletic field.

28:36.936 --> 28:38.836
- This is your brainstorm?
- Well...

28:38.871 --> 28:41.931
How come we're out here
dancing cheek to cheek by ourselves?

28:41.974 --> 28:46.468
Because this thing with Karen's
been taking all of my time, T.C.

28:46.512 --> 28:49.174
- What did you get?
- Forget the used car salesman.

28:49.215 --> 28:52.878
Ice Pick said the guy won the money
for his trip to Hawaii at a racetrack.

28:52.918 --> 28:58.356
I've got something else for you. Karen's
boyfriend's been scoring dope in town.

28:59.425 --> 29:03.657
- Robert Brighton?
- That's right. Small quantities of heroin.

29:03.696 --> 29:07.792
And he's got a woman stashed at a beach
house at the Kalanianaole Highway.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.266
Magnum.

29:10.636 --> 29:12.729
- Have you heard the news?
- What?

29:12.771 --> 29:17.640
The police searched Karen's apartment
and found a large quantity of digoxin.

29:17.676 --> 29:19.644
Well, she is a doctor.

29:19.678 --> 29:22.545
They also arrested her for murder.

29:30.305 --> 29:34.002
<i>I tried to talk to Karen at the police station
but I couldn't get near her.</i>

29:34.042 --> 29:38.240
<i>With a little help from Rick, I got the address
of a cottage Brighton kept in Waikiki</i>

29:38.279 --> 29:40.076
<i>and I drove by for a chat</i>.

29:40.114 --> 29:44.949
<i>Unless I was very wrong about Karen,
someone planted those drugs in her house.</i>

29:44.986 --> 29:49.923
<i>After what Rick had said,
Robert was a real strong possibility.</i>

30:05.106 --> 30:06.664
Er... Miss?

30:14.649 --> 30:15.877
Magnum!

30:17.385 --> 30:20.843
You just keep sticking your nose in
where it doesn't belong.

30:20.888 --> 30:23.356
- Look, Robert.
- You look. You're on a crusade

30:23.391 --> 30:25.825
trying to prove what a hotshot you are.

30:25.860 --> 30:27.691
I'm just trying to help Karen.

30:27.729 --> 30:31.495
By snooping into people's lives
and houses and abusing their families?

30:31.532 --> 30:35.901
Karen was arrested when the cops found
drugs in her house. She didn't put 'em there.

30:35.937 --> 30:39.236
You think I did? What do you take me for?

30:39.273 --> 30:42.470
Well, you tell me.
I know you've been scoring heroin.

30:42.510 --> 30:45.570
Then there's this house. And the girl.

30:48.950 --> 30:50.781
Magnum,

30:50.818 --> 30:53.753
this has nothing to do with Karen at all

30:53.788 --> 30:55.517
and that girl is my sister.

30:55.556 --> 31:00.755
I flew her over here from the mainland
because she was killing herself on heroin.

31:00.795 --> 31:04.856
I thought maybe if I got her here
to Hawaii I could help her kick it,

31:04.899 --> 31:06.696
slowly and quietly.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.565
Does Karen know about this?

31:08.603 --> 31:11.231
I couldn't tell her.
She's got enough to deal with.

31:11.272 --> 31:13.172
Bobby, please!

31:16.878 --> 31:18.607
All right, honey. Come on.

31:18.646 --> 31:22.047
I'd appreciate it, Magnum,
if you wouldn't mention this to Karen.

31:26.888 --> 31:30.847
The role of architect as artist
has been sorely neglected.

31:31.726 --> 31:35.822
Where the painter has oils,
the sculptor marble or clay,

31:35.863 --> 31:39.924
the poet words,
the architect has only space.

31:40.668 --> 31:44.832
That immaterial essence the painter
suggests and the sculptor fills,

31:44.872 --> 31:46.965
the architect envelops.

31:50.945 --> 31:53.743
But listen to me rattling on.

31:53.781 --> 31:58.275
Forgive me, Dr. Harmon.
After all, you did come to see Magnum.

31:58.319 --> 32:03.347
Until he comes, may I get you something?
Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea?

32:03.391 --> 32:06.724
No. No, thank you, Mr. Higgins. I'm fine.

32:06.761 --> 32:10.390
It's, er... It's just that
I've never been in jail before.

32:10.431 --> 32:14.595
- It was so horrible.
- I know too well what you mean.

32:15.436 --> 32:17.495
They fingerprinted me.

32:19.874 --> 32:21.774
And, er...

32:21.809 --> 32:24.004
And then they body-searched me.

32:27.248 --> 32:34.177
And then they put me in this room
that, um... that smelled of smoke

32:34.222 --> 32:36.486
and sweat

32:36.524 --> 32:38.151
and urine.

32:40.695 --> 32:46.861
It was one of... Like one of those terrible
interrogation cells at Long Binh prison.

32:46.901 --> 32:50.598
Dr. Harmon.
Perhaps you shouldn't talk about it.

32:52.173 --> 32:54.334
The thing is,

32:54.375 --> 32:58.971
there was a...
there was a point where I didn't...

32:59.013 --> 33:04.679
I really, really didn't know if what they were
saying about me was true or not.

33:04.719 --> 33:08.177
- Dr. Harmon...
- That's been happening a lot lately.

33:09.924 --> 33:16.193
Dr. Jorgenson came to see me
to, uh... forgive me for my mistake.

33:18.399 --> 33:23.234
I heard myself saying that I hadn't done it.

33:25.439 --> 33:30.467
But somewhere inside of me,
I knew that I had.

33:30.511 --> 33:33.275
That what he was saying was right.

33:35.983 --> 33:39.578
And I wanted so badly to be forgiven.

33:44.325 --> 33:46.725
You see, that's what scares me.

33:46.761 --> 33:49.628
I can't remember anything.

33:52.433 --> 33:54.867
Do you think I could have done it
and not remember?

33:56.904 --> 34:00.601
No. I'm certain you couldn't have.

34:01.709 --> 34:06.237
There are some things
that I remember so clearly.

34:07.548 --> 34:09.675
People and...

34:09.717 --> 34:11.810
places from Nam.

34:13.853 --> 34:16.687
Like they're happening all over again.

34:21.996 --> 34:25.693
I have seen so much death.

34:27.268 --> 34:30.601
And so much senseless pain.

34:33.841 --> 34:36.969
Other people can't understand that.

34:37.645 --> 34:39.579
They just can't.

34:40.581 --> 34:46.018
Dr. Harmon. Any of us
who have experienced the horrors of war

34:46.053 --> 34:49.648
have them indelibly printed on our minds.

34:49.690 --> 34:52.215
But that's the only place they exist.

34:53.494 --> 34:56.018
The war is over.

34:56.063 --> 34:58.395
Maybe it's never over.

35:00.901 --> 35:02.493
Maybe we always...

35:03.537 --> 35:06.802
carry the war around inside of us.

35:08.009 --> 35:10.170
Like a time bomb.

35:11.946 --> 35:13.811
Ticking away.

35:15.850 --> 35:18.045
Waiting to go off.

35:23.991 --> 35:27.518
Why don't I make us that tea?

35:37.872 --> 35:39.772
Nurse!

35:41.309 --> 35:43.106
Help me!

35:46.747 --> 35:48.738
Nurse!

36:10.971 --> 36:12.734
Magnum.

36:21.449 --> 36:24.782
- What happened to you?
- Someone tried to run me off the Pali.

36:24.819 --> 36:27.617
- Who?
- It's a little hard to tell.

36:27.655 --> 36:30.123
I was too busy trying to save my skin.

36:30.157 --> 36:32.751
But I've sure got a hunch.
How about Karen Harmon?

36:35.429 --> 36:38.262
- She's in jail.
- She's been out on bail for five hours.

36:38.299 --> 36:41.200
And she came looking for you?
Come on, that's crazy.

36:41.235 --> 36:44.602
That's exactly why I think it's her.

36:45.439 --> 36:49.170
I know you can find her. I'm willing
to keep my mouth shut around the cops.

36:49.210 --> 36:51.178
All I want is an exclusive on her story.

36:53.547 --> 36:56.573
- Who's your source?
- That's my business.

36:58.152 --> 37:00.017
You said you wanted an exclusive.

37:00.054 --> 37:03.080
I told you. I cannot reveal my sources.

37:04.458 --> 37:08.485
Well, this had to be someone
with an axe to grind,

37:08.529 --> 37:11.464
someone with something to protect, or both.

37:11.499 --> 37:15.230
Someone who wanted to see Karen
take a fall and used you to set her up.

37:15.269 --> 37:17.737
- I don't believe that.
- Maybe not.

37:17.772 --> 37:22.266
But if it is, see, with Karen in jail,
you're expendable.

37:23.411 --> 37:29.372
You know, Daniels, this little story of yours
just might end up getting you killed.

37:38.058 --> 37:41.323
It was Harriman. Phillip Harriman.

38:45.326 --> 38:47.317
Mr. Harriman? Hi, kitty.

38:47.361 --> 38:49.295
Mr. Harriman?

39:06.614 --> 39:08.275
Mr. Harriman?

39:09.583 --> 39:11.244
Mr. Harriman.

39:28.797 --> 39:31.459
Hello, again.

39:32.738 --> 39:36.834
- What are you, a jack-in-the-box?
- Funny. Very original.

39:36.876 --> 39:41.939
Well, it looks like Harriman's death
kind of... shall we say... kills your theory.

39:41.981 --> 39:44.973
What do you want to bet he died of digoxin?

39:45.017 --> 39:48.453
- Maybe he just had a heart attack.
- He was murdered and you know it.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.751
The autopsy's gonna show that.

39:52.892 --> 39:55.326
You're not gonna wait for the autopsy,
are you?

39:55.361 --> 39:59.229
- I can't print what I don't know is fact.
- Why change now?

39:59.265 --> 40:02.757
- What are you gonna write?
- What I always write. The truth.

40:02.802 --> 40:06.829
That you talked to Harriman
and that he died unexpectedly

40:06.873 --> 40:11.572
and that it's suspected murder, and I found
the body and I just happen to know Karen

40:11.611 --> 40:13.772
who's up on murder charges in the hospital

40:13.813 --> 40:17.249
where Harriman
just happened to be chief administrator.

40:17.283 --> 40:20.514
- It's the truth, isn't it?
- On the surface, absolutely.

40:20.553 --> 40:25.217
It's just what's between the lines that
bothers me. But that's what you're best at.

40:28.127 --> 40:31.563
You know,
everyone thinks of doctors as gods.

40:31.597 --> 40:35.294
Above the law, beyond reproach,
like members of some exclusive club.

40:35.334 --> 40:41.136
I'm sorry, but I don't think that I'm doing
a disservice to society by proving otherwise.

40:41.173 --> 40:44.506
Well, I told you what I'd do
if you hassled Karen again.

40:44.543 --> 40:48.479
Well, you weren't exactly specific.
Something about a snake.

40:49.916 --> 40:53.852
That was just your ego talking.
You wouldn't risk a lawsuit for...

41:00.826 --> 41:03.124
<i>Slugging Daniels was a childish reaction</i>.

41:03.162 --> 41:07.326
<i>He was right. It would probably
get me sued or arrested or both.</i>

41:07.366 --> 41:09.425
<i>But it was worth it</i>.

41:10.770 --> 41:14.171
<i>With Harriman dead,
I was running out of suspects.</i>

41:14.206 --> 41:17.573
<i>Worst of all, I started thinking
Daniels might be right.</i>

41:17.610 --> 41:21.637
<i>Deep down, I still didn't believe that
but I was running low on conviction.</i>

41:21.681 --> 41:24.707
<i>I hoped talking to Karen
would take care of that,</i>

41:24.750 --> 41:27.014
<i>if I could find her</i>.

41:27.787 --> 41:29.414
<i>And if she'd talk</i>.

41:29.455 --> 41:31.480
She was here, frantic to talk with you.

41:31.524 --> 41:33.458
What do you mean? You let her go?

41:33.492 --> 41:38.054
Of course I didn't. The poor woman was
hysterical. I went to make her a cup of tea.

41:38.097 --> 41:41.498
- As I did, she bolted like a frightened colt.
- How hysterical?

41:41.534 --> 41:45.971
On the verge of a complete breakdown.
Rambling on about Vietnam, the hospital,

41:46.005 --> 41:48.906
blaming it on herself.
She's under enormous pressure.

41:48.941 --> 41:51.774
The police, the press. Even Dr. Jorgenson.

41:51.811 --> 41:53.210
Dr. Jorgenson?

41:53.245 --> 41:56.612
He stopped by to forgive her
and suggest she admit her mistake.

41:56.649 --> 41:58.674
It upset her terribly.

41:58.718 --> 42:01.983
- Dr. Jorgenson isn't noted for his tact.
- What do you mean?

42:02.021 --> 42:04.455
His application to join the club was rejected.

42:04.490 --> 42:06.515
- Why?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

42:06.559 --> 42:11.121
- Damn it, Higgins!
- He's a terrible philanderer.

42:11.163 --> 42:14.428
We found evidence
of no fewer than nine illicit affairs.

42:14.467 --> 42:16.560
His wife was threatening to leave him.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.729
- T.C., come on.
- Come on?

42:18.771 --> 42:22.935
Yeah, you don't want to keep working
on that thing all day. Come on.

42:31.183 --> 42:32.309
Hey!

42:32.351 --> 42:34.444
Hey, what about me?

42:44.697 --> 42:47.757
- It's their loss, Rick.
- We're stuck with all the work.

42:47.800 --> 42:51.566
But we have the satisfaction
of having completed the task at hand.

42:51.604 --> 42:55.563
And of course, we'll have the everlasting
appreciation of Zeus and Apollo.

42:55.608 --> 42:57.542
Isn't that right, lads?

43:08.754 --> 43:11.120
It's the lighthouse at Makapuu Point.

43:11.157 --> 43:13.591
I know where we're going.
I wanna know why.

43:13.626 --> 43:15.093
Dr. Karen Harmon.

43:35.414 --> 43:37.109
There she is.

43:45.191 --> 43:46.556
Nurse!

43:49.762 --> 43:51.730
Nurse!

43:56.569 --> 43:58.696
<i>Karen, he's dead</i>.

44:00.506 --> 44:01.666
Karen.

44:05.478 --> 44:08.413
- It's me, Thomas.
- Go away!

44:09.381 --> 44:12.407
- Karen, I want to talk to you.
- I am tired of talking

44:12.451 --> 44:16.615
and tired of listening to too many words
that don't make any sense.

44:16.655 --> 44:19.249
You've been listening to the wrong people.

44:19.291 --> 44:23.193
You didn't kill those patients.
I think Dr. Jorgenson did it.

44:23.229 --> 44:25.595
And he used you
so he wouldn't be suspected.

44:26.732 --> 44:28.996
- Why?
- To cover up killing his wife.

44:30.503 --> 44:33.961
No. No, I can't believe that, Thomas.

44:34.006 --> 44:38.705
Karen, don't give up.
Not now. Not when it's almost over.

44:38.744 --> 44:41.736
It's over for me now!

44:41.780 --> 44:45.045
No, it's not.
You've been through worse and survived.

44:45.084 --> 44:48.281
It's too much for me to take this time,
Thomas.

44:48.320 --> 44:51.187
Just let me be.

44:51.223 --> 44:54.454
What are you gonna do, Karen?
Gonna jump?

44:55.928 --> 44:57.190
Yes.

44:57.229 --> 45:01.063
Four innocent people have already died.
You jump, it's gonna be five.

45:01.100 --> 45:04.467
You went to Nam to help people come back.

45:05.437 --> 45:08.099
Became a doctor to help people live.

45:08.140 --> 45:12.201
You wanna give up on yourself,
that's your choice.

45:14.947 --> 45:17.745
Just don't expect me
to stand here and watch it.

45:26.058 --> 45:27.525
Thomas.

45:31.564 --> 45:32.758
Wait up.

45:50.382 --> 45:52.316
- Stay down.
- OK.

46:09.535 --> 46:13.062
<i>I knew if he had a revolver
he only had six shots.</i>

46:13.105 --> 46:16.973
<i>Course, if he had an automatic,
he could have seven. Or eight.</i>

46:17.009 --> 46:20.843
<i>Then again, he could have
one of those 13-shot automatics.</i>

46:20.879 --> 46:23.370
<i>Or he could have two guns</i>.

46:23.415 --> 46:24.712
<i>Oh, well</i>.

46:24.750 --> 46:26.684
Damn it, T.C. Where are you?

47:29.581 --> 47:31.674
- All right?
- Yeah.

47:32.418 --> 47:34.249
Thanks, T.C.

47:38.757 --> 47:40.088
Karen?

47:49.335 --> 47:53.635
Hey, Magnum.
How about that 20 bucks you owe me?
