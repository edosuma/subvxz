WEBVTT

00:12.055 --> 00:14.014
I'm retiring.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.363
What?
Why?

00:15.406 --> 00:17.582
I've done as much
as I can do here.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.410
I will stay
until the end of the year,

00:19.454 --> 00:22.196
but after that I should move on.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.285
<i>STR Laurie wants
a 20% downsizing</i>

00:24.328 --> 00:26.069
of the firm.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.550
Okay. I retire.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.464
That'll be cut in half.

00:29.507 --> 00:30.639
Do you believe him?

00:30.682 --> 00:32.728
This is some selfless act?

00:32.771 --> 00:34.469
Are you kidding me?

00:34.512 --> 00:37.646
This is about
the Democratic Party.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.737
Four years from now, we need
an African American candidate

00:41.780 --> 00:43.869
-that can go the distance.
-So, how can I help?

00:43.913 --> 00:46.568
You can be that candidate.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.832
you write a book.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.313
A political statement.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.792
And a memoir.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.707
Got you a contract
with Simon & Schuster

00:55.751 --> 00:58.188
to write about
your political awakening.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.414
Years ago,
I wanted to create

01:06.457 --> 01:08.677
a law firm run entirely
by women,

01:08.720 --> 01:10.722
but it never worked out.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.594
So, why not now?

01:12.637 --> 01:15.336
--What, Reddick/
-Lockhart?
-Just you and me.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.729
-We don't bring in a third.
-Partners?

01:18.730 --> 01:19.862
Partners.

01:19.905 --> 01:22.343
Stella Corben.
I am Inspector General

01:22.386 --> 01:23.692
at the Department of Justice.

01:23.735 --> 01:26.173
I say this with a heavy heart,

01:26.216 --> 01:29.306
but Judge Cain is guilty
of accepting a bribe.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.918
This carries a sentence
of up to 15 years.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.485
Isn't this retribution

01:34.529 --> 01:35.704
for Judge Cain's coming
to your office,

01:35.747 --> 01:37.880
requesting whistleblower
protection?

01:37.923 --> 01:39.447
Of course not.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.449
You're here as a whistleblower,
Julius.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.929
<i>Didn't Judge Cain come
to your office</i>

01:43.973 --> 01:47.411
with accusations about
something called Memo 618?

01:47.455 --> 01:50.327
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.547
<i>Memo 618 is a document</i>

01:52.590 --> 01:55.376
<i>used to intimidate judges
into ruling</i>

01:55.419 --> 01:56.986
for the more powerful party.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.554
And you are testifying
that Judge Cain

01:59.597 --> 02:01.730
didn't come to your office
regarding this?

02:01.773 --> 02:04.733
I'm testifying that
Judge Cain came to my office

02:04.776 --> 02:08.824
to put pressure on me
to drop the bribery charge.

02:08.867 --> 02:11.783
Well, it's a good thing
I recorded that meeting.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.438
Objection.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.572
Counselor, is that
a one-party consent recording?

02:17.615 --> 02:18.921
It is, but in federal court,

02:18.964 --> 02:20.401
one-party consent
is permissible.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.577
We're in Illinois,
a two-party state.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.231
Sustained.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.320
-They're going to destroy me.
-We'll move for a recusal.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.235
She'll just deny it.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.975
Not if we threaten
to expose her complicity

02:30.019 --> 02:32.761
-regarding Memo 618.
-How can we do that?

-No.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.074
You went to St. Lucia.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.467
For three hours.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.338
Well, now you're going

♪ <i>The rain

03:42.352 --> 03:44.659
So, what I have in mind is
a book called <i>Ten Cases,</i>

03:44.702 --> 03:47.705
outlining my top ten
police brutality cases,

03:47.749 --> 03:51.361
making the connection between
police and systemic racism.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.928
Oh, I love it.

03:52.971 --> 03:55.322
So, how about this?
Talk about your ten cases

03:55.365 --> 03:57.062
but how they opened your mind

03:57.106 --> 03:59.717
about how white and Black
can work together.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.720
But that's not really
the book I want to write.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.853
I understand.
I understand but consider it.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.116
Your Honor,
this is a high-conflict divorce.

04:07.159 --> 04:10.075
And the key is
this psychological study.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.947
I wouldn't present it
as a psychological study.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.340
Just use the evidence.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.950
When I want your legal opinion,
I'll ask for it.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.126
David,
this judge rejects psycholog...

04:17.169 --> 04:20.738
Your Honor, I'd like to submit
as evidence this study

04:20.782 --> 04:23.480
that the respondent has
narcissistic...

who's frustrated.

04:30.574 --> 04:31.967
I need some advice for her.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.931
Good, say hi
to the queen for me.

04:39.975 --> 04:43.892
This friend is getting
frustrated with her job,

04:43.935 --> 04:46.111
and she maybe wants to be
a lawyer.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.852

she could become one?

<i>-What do you mean, the quickest?
-I don't know, like,</i>

04:49.593 --> 04:51.595
is there some way
to accelerate the process?

04:51.639 --> 04:53.945
Some schools offer
a 3+3 program.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.512
You can go to law school

of college.

04:57.122 --> 04:59.386
No, no, she's not in college.

-I don't know.</i>

05:04.086 --> 05:06.784
I'm just checking.
I hate being talked down to.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.570
Okay. First of all,
you'd be great.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.093
I would, wouldn't I?

05:11.136 --> 05:12.660
-I could wipe the floor
in court. <i>
-Second of all,</i>

05:12.703 --> 05:14.444
enroll at law school.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.576
Take summer programs.

05:15.619 --> 05:16.751
You can get it down
to two years.

05:16.794 --> 05:17.969
-Oy. <i>
-I know.</i>

05:18.013 --> 05:19.754
It's... it's not easy.

05:19.797 --> 05:23.410
-Where are you, in church?

05:23.453 --> 05:25.412
<i>No. That must be Big Ben.</i>

05:25.455 --> 05:27.675
Okay, uh,
let's talk when you get in.

05:27.718 --> 05:30.852

I am actually really in London.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.767

this afternoon.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.888

I'm kind of, kind of busy.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.760
Who-who is this?

06:09.804 --> 06:12.633
It's Adrian, Jay,

06:12.676 --> 06:14.504
<i>Why did I call you?</i>

06:14.548 --> 06:15.984
Jay, I'm trying to write
right now.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.813
I... I think...

06:18.856 --> 06:21.119
I think you're my father.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.644
Okay.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.776
All right, get some rest.
We'll talk tomorrow.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.038
All right? <i>
-Something's wrong.</i>

06:27.082 --> 06:29.258
I'm having trouble seeing.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.655
Where are you, Jay?

06:41.531 --> 06:44.012
Jay, listen to me.
Did you take anything?

06:44.055 --> 06:46.057
No. I don't like pills.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.537
Where are we going?

06:47.581 --> 06:48.843
We're going to the hospital.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.279
There's something very wrong
with you.

06:50.322 --> 06:51.846
What?

06:51.889 --> 06:53.282
I-I... I don't know.

06:53.325 --> 06:56.024
There's this thing from China.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.852
Have you been
with anybody from overseas?

06:59.331 --> 07:01.812
I don't know.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.032
-What-What's from China?
-Just stay still.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.512
Don't try to get up.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.966
Hello, Diane.
Thanks for meeting with us.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.228
How could I not?

07:26.271 --> 07:28.578
What can I do for you,
Mr. Bloomberg?

07:28.622 --> 07:29.971
Let me take you back to 2016.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.799
-Pre-Trump?
-No.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.714
Post-Harry Dargis.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.063
Remember that name?

07:35.106 --> 07:36.586
Of course.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.067
Four years ago, I represented
him in federal court.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.590
His daughter was shot
and killed.

07:40.634 --> 07:41.765
With an illegally purchased gun.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.724
-And we lost.
-But we had a good case,

07:43.767 --> 07:45.552
and now we're working
on the appeal.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.815
We have a date in front of the
Supreme Court later this year.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.120
Really?

08:02.786 --> 08:03.918
<i>What were you working on?</i>

08:03.961 --> 08:05.920
-My book.
-Oh, right.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.748
How is that going?

08:07.791 --> 08:09.271
It's bullshit.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.143
What about you?

08:12.187 --> 08:14.885
Oh, it's this Supreme Court
gun control case.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.279
Could be really momentous.

08:17.322 --> 08:18.715
But...?

08:18.759 --> 08:20.282
They have the wrong strategy.

08:20.325 --> 08:23.372
They're making technical points
when they really should be

08:23.415 --> 08:25.809
trying to sway
Chief Justice Roberts.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.419
Okay.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.161
Tell 'em that.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.033
D.C. lawyers.

08:32.076 --> 08:34.035
-They don't want to hear it.

08:38.343 --> 08:39.867
What the fuck?!

08:41.912 --> 08:43.348
-Whoa!
-The fuck?

08:50.094 --> 08:52.314
Can I tell you
what I really want?

08:54.838 --> 08:56.710
Sure. What?

08:56.753 --> 09:00.104
I want to argue
in front of the Supreme Court.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.369
If that's what you want,

09:04.413 --> 09:06.720
you fucking tell 'em that.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.288
I'm telling them
my book is shit.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.075
Tell 'em.

09:21.299 --> 09:23.650
-Bottoms up.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.001
Mr. Bloomberg.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.003
Oh, yes, sorry. Mike.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.005
Yeah, I think we have
a real case here,

09:31.048 --> 09:33.224
and I want to be involved.

09:33.268 --> 09:36.793
But I think it's essential
that I be the mouthpiece

09:36.837 --> 09:38.099
-in front of the Court.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.144
-Hello?
-Well,

09:40.188 --> 09:42.016
I'll tell you, the key is

09:42.059 --> 09:44.279
-to bring Chief Justice Roberts
over to our side.
-Yeah, hold on.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.194
Uh, Adrian's calling.

09:46.237 --> 09:50.372
Uh, no, and I think I have
a John Roberts secret weapon.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.374
-She's gonna have
to call you back.
-I already talked to the client

09:52.417 --> 09:53.941
-and he agrees.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.683
Yes. Great.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.467
So, I-I will call you back.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.079
Good news?

10:02.123 --> 10:03.951
For me.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.780
I am arguing
in front of the Supreme Court.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.043
For you, eh...

10:09.086 --> 10:11.045
I'm getting your beloved guns
off the street.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.786
My beloved guns?

10:12.829 --> 10:14.701
Now I need something from you,
my darling bear.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.224
Oh, God.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.529
What?

10:18.748 --> 10:20.968
Be my John Roberts.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.059
Hey, Julius.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.147
-How is he?
-They just closed the doors.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.757
They're not letting anybody in.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.106
-Why not?
-It's this coronavirus thing.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.934
They're afraid it's spreading.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.850
-Where are you going?
-To see him.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.983
-The doctors said no.
-Well, then they can stop me.

10:52.956 --> 10:56.786
<i>They've come back to me with
one inescapable conclusion.</i>

10:56.830 --> 11:00.181
To avoid the loss of potentially
tens of thousands of lives,

11:00.224 --> 11:03.488
we must enact an immediate
stay-at-home order

11:03.532 --> 11:05.316
<i>for the state of Illinois.</i>

11:05.360 --> 11:08.406
<i>So that is the action
that I'm announcing today.</i>

11:08.450 --> 11:12.062
<i>We have looked closely
at the trajectory of this virus</i>

11:12.106 --> 11:14.325
<i>in countries
like Italy and China.</i>

11:14.369 --> 11:17.546
<i>Left unchecked, cases
in Illinois will rise rapidly.</i>

11:17.589 --> 11:19.156
<i>All we know</i>

11:19.200 --> 11:21.463
is that this
stay-at-home order will last

11:21.506 --> 11:23.378
until April 8th.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.293
At that point, you'll all
be getting invitations

11:25.336 --> 11:26.773
-to come back to work.
-Are we all being asked back?

11:26.816 --> 11:28.165
We hope so,

11:28.209 --> 11:29.950
-but we really don't know.
-How do we know

11:29.993 --> 11:31.299
-whether we still have a job?
-We'll be calling you guys

11:31.342 --> 11:32.822
hopefully within a week.

11:32.866 --> 11:33.954
So we just wait by the phone?

11:33.997 --> 11:35.085
In the meantime,
we're setting up

11:35.129 --> 11:37.305
a teleconferencing
infrastructure.

11:37.348 --> 11:41.788
So download a program
called Zoom.com.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.791
Z-O-O-M.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.401
Get on your computers.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.838
Zoom.com.

11:48.882 --> 11:51.188
I hate saying this, but...

11:51.232 --> 11:53.147
Yeah.
I'm thinking the same thing.

11:53.190 --> 11:57.325
It's a better opportunity for
us to start laying off our 20%.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.502
-Are you kidding me? <i>
-You weren't at the office,</i>

12:00.545 --> 12:03.505
so I just wanted to be
the one who told you.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.985
So you're firing me?

12:05.028 --> 12:07.161
<i>No, but given this pandemic,</i>

12:07.204 --> 12:09.946
<i>there's just no practical work
for an investigator.</i>

12:09.990 --> 12:12.166
I'm sorry, Marissa.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.515
I'm sorry, too.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.003
Okay, I'm going to law school.
Where should I go?

12:23.046 --> 12:25.092
Let me think about it, Marissa.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.615
I'll call you back.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.010
Okay.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.881
So...

12:31.925 --> 12:34.492
let's take a break.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.408
How are the negotiations going?

12:37.452 --> 12:39.062
<i>We're still ten million off.</i>

12:39.106 --> 12:40.542
<i>That's good enough.</i>

12:40.585 --> 12:42.196
<i>You can say yes if you want.</i>

12:42.239 --> 12:45.112
Why am I more concerned
about your money than you are?

12:45.155 --> 12:46.940
'Cause you're good at your job.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.855
-Now, what'd you need? <i>
-Actually, it's not for me.</i>

12:48.898 --> 12:50.030
<i>It's for a friend.</i>

12:50.073 --> 12:51.422
She wants to go to law school,

12:51.466 --> 12:53.860
and I know you gave
an endowment to Chicago-Kent

12:53.903 --> 12:55.339
because I approved it.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.080
So I was hoping
you can make a call.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.604
You call. You represent me.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.346
They're not gonna take
a call from Lucca Quinn.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.566
<i>They will
because they know you're me.</i>

13:04.609 --> 13:07.221
Now I have a proposal for you.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.700
Okay.

13:38.382 --> 13:40.428
-Hello? <i>
Hello?</i>

13:40.471 --> 13:42.343
<i>I was given this number
for Marissa Gold.</i>

13:42.386 --> 13:44.606
This is she,
but I don't work here anymore.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.913
<i>Ms. Gold,
my name is Rasputin Loggins,</i>

13:46.956 --> 13:48.610
<i>and I work
for the admittance office</i>

13:48.653 --> 13:50.612
<i>of the Chicago-Kent
College of Law.</i>

13:50.655 --> 13:53.441
<i>And we want to congratulate you
for joining</i>

13:53.484 --> 13:55.095
<i>our first-year program.</i>

13:55.138 --> 13:56.531
What?

13:57.532 --> 14:00.187
<i>Welcome to the world of law.</i>

14:00.230 --> 14:02.929
Are you sure
you want to do this?

14:02.972 --> 14:05.627
We're sheltering-in-place.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.369
Why not together?

14:08.412 --> 14:10.414
Mm.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.636
You could end up hating me.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.552
It's a risk.

14:17.595 --> 14:20.468
-Or I could end up hating you.
-Mm-mm.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.296
No way in the world.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.472
I'm way too lovable.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.956
<i>Breaking news.</i>

14:29.999 --> 14:32.132
<i>We're getting eyewitness
footage out of Minnesota</i>

14:32.175 --> 14:33.611
<i>of a deadly police encounter.</i>

14:33.655 --> 14:35.048
<i>A warning to our viewers,</i>

14:35.091 --> 14:37.093

14:37.137 --> 14:39.530
<i>A 46-year-old Black man

14:39.574 --> 14:42.664
<i>for allegedly buying cigarettes

14:42.707 --> 14:45.449
<i>Eight minutes
and 46 seconds later,</i>

14:45.493 --> 14:47.582
<i>he was dead when
a Minneapolis police officer</i>

14:47.625 --> 14:49.236
<i>kneeled on his neck,
suffocating him.</i>

14:53.066 --> 14:54.415
Ruth!

14:54.458 --> 14:55.982
-Adrian.
-Yeah.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.505
I'm writing the book
I want to write.

14:57.548 --> 14:58.985
Now, y'all do
what you want to do.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.204
Now is not the time to,
you know, "talk positive."

15:01.248 --> 15:03.337
Adrian, Adrian,
just listen to me.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.121
Yeah, I-I saw
what happened, too.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.731
I saw it.

15:06.775 --> 15:09.125
But the only way to bring change
is to not give in to anger.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.648
You're kidding me, right?

15:10.692 --> 15:14.000
Giving in to anger is the only
sane response right now.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.350
-Understand? Look at that.
-I understand!

15:16.393 --> 15:17.742
-You're not hearing me!
-Look at the fucking screen!

15:17.786 --> 15:19.222
You think I didn't see it?

15:19.266 --> 15:20.441
Are you hearing me?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.225
-Are you watching?
-Listen to me.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.575
-I've seen it all!
-Don't tell me
I'm not listening!

15:24.619 --> 15:26.186
-You got nothing to say to me
right now.
-I'm...

15:26.229 --> 15:28.231
Goddamn it! Nothing!

15:28.275 --> 15:31.408
Stop talking and listen.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.327
<i>The United States
has been rocked</i>

15:37.371 --> 15:39.112
<i>by another night of protests

15:39.155 --> 15:40.417
<i>-of Mr. George Floyd...
-Listen,</i>

15:40.461 --> 15:42.376
<i>they are closing

15:42.419 --> 15:44.030
<i>so we think you should come

15:44.073 --> 15:46.815
Oh, uh, but Bianca wants
me to stay here

15:46.858 --> 15:48.469
till the end of the month.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.558
<i>Then you might get stuck there
for a long time, Lucca.</i>

15:50.601 --> 15:51.559
I know.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.039
Um, something else...

15:53.082 --> 15:55.476
She's offered me
a permanent job.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.826
-Really? <i>
-Yes.</i>

15:59.219 --> 16:01.351
Lucca.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.353
You'll give the firm a chance
to counter, right?

16:03.397 --> 16:06.095
She's offered me $500,000
a year.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.403
Well, still give the firm
a chance to counter.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.795
Sure.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.407
Um, one other thing.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.713
You have to click "private"

16:15.757 --> 16:18.107
to keep me
from seeing your chats.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.415
Uh, good to know.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.634
-Talk to you soon. <i>
-Yeah.
-Bye.</i>

16:25.332 --> 16:26.637
Shit.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.422
<i>Cities across the U.S. remain</i>

16:28.465 --> 16:30.119
<i>in a state of high tension

16:30.163 --> 16:31.599
So...

16:31.642 --> 16:33.340
Is it just us?

16:33.383 --> 16:36.256
<i>Yeah, it's just us.
We cannot beat $500,000.</i>

16:36.299 --> 16:38.693
You want to keep her,
you offer her a partnership.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.130
Okay. I'll call you back.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.873
What a--
What are you guys doing here?

16:44.916 --> 16:46.396
Same thing you are.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.311
Trying to get away
from our loved ones at home.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.704
Who's replacing Boseman?

16:50.748 --> 16:53.621
Uh... we-we don't know.

16:53.664 --> 16:56.493
We? You mean you
and Diane don't know?

16:56.537 --> 16:57.886
Yes.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.106
-I told you.
-What-what is...

17:00.149 --> 17:01.672
All right, what-what's...
what's wrong?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.631
We're an African American firm,
right?

17:03.674 --> 17:04.893
Yes.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.591
What Black firm has
a white name partner?

17:07.635 --> 17:11.247
She-she-she was a name partner
long before I got here.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.728
Yes, and she jumped
the line then.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.643
Some of us had more seniority.

17:15.686 --> 17:18.211
But she brought in Chumhum,

17:18.254 --> 17:20.474
-a client we don't even have
anymore.
-Okay.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.606
-I'm going home.
-No, Liz,

17:22.650 --> 17:24.347
we have to address this.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.480
We're losing a lot
of our associates,

17:26.523 --> 17:28.134
and most of them are Black.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.658
What is this firm
if it's not African American?

17:30.701 --> 17:33.661
It's just another
midsized all-service

17:33.704 --> 17:37.404
Midwestern law firm,
one of 50.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.841
You need to replace Diane

17:39.884 --> 17:42.409
and promote two
African Americans to partner.

17:44.498 --> 17:45.847
-You two?
-Any two.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.850
Start counting up
how many Black associates

17:48.893 --> 17:50.286
we're letting go, Liz.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.201
It's not right.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.769
<i>Jay?</i>

17:54.812 --> 17:56.510
<i>-Jay?</i>

17:56.553 --> 17:58.294
<i>Are you there?</i>

17:58.338 --> 18:00.340
<i>Over here, Jay.</i>

18:00.383 --> 18:01.863
<i>Jay, over here.</i>

18:01.906 --> 18:04.692
<i>Jay, how are you?</i>

18:04.735 --> 18:07.912
Uh... I don't know.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.219
My power is fading.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.483
<i>-Jay, can you call a nurse?
-No.</i>

18:13.527 --> 18:15.964
No, the power on the...

18:16.007 --> 18:17.966
on the... this thing.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.360
<i>-Jay, you have to tell Lucca
to stay at the firm.
-Marissa.</i>

18:20.403 --> 18:22.492
<i>She's being offered a shit-ton
of money to abandon us.</i>

18:22.536 --> 18:24.973
I'd better go.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.192
Someone is here.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.281
<i>I can hire you away.</i>

18:28.324 --> 18:29.804
<i>You can come and work for me...</i>

18:32.850 --> 18:34.678
Who are you?

18:38.726 --> 18:40.815
Are you a doctor?

18:43.818 --> 18:45.820
Who are you?

18:45.863 --> 18:48.475
Haven't you forgotten something?

18:56.613 --> 18:57.962
Are you...?

19:02.924 --> 19:04.621
You're Frederick Douglass?

19:08.451 --> 19:09.800
What did I forget?

19:09.844 --> 19:11.715
Are you going out
into the world

19:11.759 --> 19:14.370
with your hair looking
like that?

19:15.415 --> 19:16.720
Oh. Oh.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.679
Okay. Okay, uh...

19:18.722 --> 19:20.289
It's, uh-- Things have changed.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.899
It's not called "the natural"
anymore.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.642
I've been watching
our people's progress,

19:25.686 --> 19:28.254
and I'm quite familiar
with "the natural."

19:29.733 --> 19:31.561
I'm also aware that it's worn

19:31.605 --> 19:34.477
as an outer expression
of pride and dignity.

19:34.521 --> 19:37.741
You seriously think
my hairstyle is going

19:37.785 --> 19:39.743
to impact race relations?

19:39.787 --> 19:42.311
Have you forgotten?

19:43.312 --> 19:45.706
Oh. Right.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.665
My Afro Sheen Comb-Easy
and Hairspray for Sheen.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.065
Wow.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.372
That makes complete sense.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.939
My life doesn't pass
before my eyes.

20:04.333 --> 20:08.859
Commercials from <i>Soul Train</i> do.

20:23.091 --> 20:26.050
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court.

20:26.094 --> 20:29.793
Let me start by stating
what this case is not about.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.708
It is not about
the Second Amendment.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.493
Why is it not about
the Second Amendment?

20:33.536 --> 20:36.104
Because this is not about
the right to bear arms.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.584
-This is about...
-But the result
that you're looking for

20:37.627 --> 20:39.542
-is to restrict arms sales.
-No.

20:39.586 --> 20:42.980
Injured parties only ask
to be allowed to sue...

20:43.024 --> 20:44.852
But you've been employed
by Michael Bloomberg,

20:44.895 --> 20:46.375
-have you not?
-Kurt, that's not fair.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.376
-Of course it's fair.
-Wait.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.899
Who-who are you at this point?

20:48.943 --> 20:50.858
The Chief Justice or Kurt?

20:50.901 --> 20:52.338
-What's the difference?
-Well, I-I just want to know.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.948
Is this about us arguing?

20:53.991 --> 20:55.863
Or-or about my oral argument?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.909
Your oral argument.

21:09.398 --> 21:12.445
Counselor,
please maintain decorum.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.839
My apologies, Chief Justice.

21:15.883 --> 21:19.060
You just look so sexy
in that robe.

21:24.935 --> 21:27.373
-Mmm, look at that. <i>Sexy Judge.</i>

21:27.416 --> 21:29.940
-New this fall. Mmm...
-Mmm.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.116
I can't. I have a motion.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.902
-Yeah. God, I got a motion, too.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.774
<i>Your Honor, we're ready.
And you're muted.</i>

21:37.818 --> 21:39.646
-Let's do it while you're muted.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.083
Is the defense ready?

21:42.126 --> 21:43.084
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

21:48.524 --> 21:50.657
This is Judge
Charlotte Hazlewood...

21:52.180 --> 21:54.574
So, what's going on?

21:54.617 --> 21:56.184
<i>John and Madeline came to me</i>

21:56.227 --> 22:00.014
<i>about the firm losing
its culture.</i>

22:00.057 --> 22:01.972
Yeah, I was wondering
when somebody would raise

22:02.016 --> 22:04.801
-that issue again.
-They want me to demote Diane.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.107
But that's not up to you, right?

22:06.150 --> 22:07.630
You can't demote her.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.023
They could vote her out.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.720
<i>But will they?</i>

22:10.764 --> 22:13.114
Well, I mean, we're-we're
losing you and-and Lucca

22:13.157 --> 22:17.466
<i>and-and...
and 15 Black associates.</i>

22:17.510 --> 22:19.773
I mean, we're only losing
four white associates.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.123
-So, what are you thinking? <i>
-I'm thinking that</i>

22:22.166 --> 22:24.604
if Biden wins,
there might be a reason

22:24.647 --> 22:26.823
to be a Black firm again.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.480
Well, if you're thinking it,
then Diane's thinking it, too.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.091
<i>White guilt.</i>

22:34.135 --> 22:38.095
It runs very deep
on that one, huh?

22:38.139 --> 22:40.446
Memo 618 is just
for brinksmanship.

22:40.489 --> 22:41.925
<i>That's not what I'm hearing.</i>

22:41.969 --> 22:44.450
They don't have a case.
Diane is just preening.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.190
Julius will make a deal.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.454
<i>He's been resistant up till now.</i>

22:48.497 --> 22:50.194
I'm the judge on the case.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.632
Just make the offer.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.155
He'll come around.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.555
Well, this is highly secretive.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.774
Just drive around the block,
Diane.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.826
Okay.

23:12.869 --> 23:15.176
I can't tell you
how I know this,

23:15.219 --> 23:17.961
but the judge
in Julius's case...

23:18.005 --> 23:20.616
-Judge Hazlewood?
-Just let me talk.

23:20.660 --> 23:24.054
It's better
that you don't say anything.

23:27.101 --> 23:30.147
There was a discussion

23:30.191 --> 23:33.281
about using the case to pressure
Julius into taking a deal.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.197
A discussion with whom?

23:37.241 --> 23:39.983
I really shouldn't know this,

23:40.027 --> 23:42.246
but I do.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.205
I checked
their Internet history.

23:44.248 --> 23:47.295
If you tell me, I will use it.

23:47.338 --> 23:50.254
And that is why I'm taking
a minute right now.

23:54.171 --> 23:57.174
The recipient's name...

23:57.218 --> 23:59.263
is Josiah Nile.

23:59.307 --> 24:02.266
Five emails were sent to him.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.878
You have a motion to recuse,
Counselor?

24:04.921 --> 24:07.010
I do, Your Honor.
We ask to approach the bench.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.099
If you think it'll make
a difference.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.278
Josiah Nile.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.021
Meaning?

24:18.065 --> 24:20.154
We ask that you recuse
yourself, Your Honor.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.591
Or we'll need to call him
as a witness

24:22.635 --> 24:25.768
and read five emails
that you wrote to him.

24:27.727 --> 24:30.077
These are from Adrian?

24:30.120 --> 24:32.601
I can't say, Your Honor.

24:34.081 --> 24:38.999
You've made
a big mistake, ma'am.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.566
You're probably right,

24:40.609 --> 24:43.090
but we need you
to recuse yourself.

24:46.136 --> 24:48.748
The defense's motion is granted.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.838
A new judge will be assigned
in the next two days.

24:51.881 --> 24:54.101
Good luck.

24:54.144 --> 24:55.798
What?

24:55.842 --> 24:58.018
God.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.281
How's everybody doing today?

25:00.324 --> 25:02.239
Oh, my God.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.590
So, what are we doing here?

25:04.633 --> 25:06.113
It's a burglary charge, right?

25:06.156 --> 25:08.594
A judge, too. That's awful.

25:08.637 --> 25:11.684
Resorting to burglarizing.

25:13.381 --> 25:15.775
Am I supposed to be wearing
a mask or something?

25:17.777 --> 25:19.648
-You headed out, huh?
-Home.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.826
Are we sick of each other, then?

25:24.871 --> 25:27.351
That's not what this is about,
and you know it.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.439
Okay.

25:31.181 --> 25:32.966
Come on. Let's talk this out.
Come...

25:33.009 --> 25:34.837
You made your choice, Adrian.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.796
Julius Cain over me.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.798
The choice was about
right and wrong, Charlotte.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.408
Well, maybe you can ask him
to move in and suck your dick.

25:40.451 --> 25:41.801
Oh.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.629
It was about getting you
to recuse yourself.

25:43.672 --> 25:44.891
Oh, come on.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.327
Fuck!

25:46.370 --> 25:49.809
You listened in
on my Zoom calls.

25:49.852 --> 25:52.246
You checked my emails!

25:52.289 --> 25:56.076
Emails from some motherfucker
who will destroy your career

25:56.119 --> 25:57.904
and wreck this relationship,
Charlotte.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.296
You understand?

25:59.340 --> 26:01.342
Some Trump
administration stooge.

26:01.385 --> 26:06.173
-For God's sake!
-Your friend Julius is
the Trump administration stooge.

26:06.216 --> 26:08.784
He is a Republican judge!

26:08.828 --> 26:10.830
He is also a partner
in the law firm

26:10.873 --> 26:13.006
that I've helped build
for five years.

26:13.049 --> 26:16.183
This is work I have dedicated
my whole fucking life to,

26:16.226 --> 26:20.013
-Charlotte.
-You said the choice was
between right and wrong.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.362
-Yes, I did.
-No.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.887
Turning over my emails was
the choice.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.759
Oh, God.

26:30.893 --> 26:33.896
Listen to me, Charlotte.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.072
Listen to me. Listen to me.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.207
I love you.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.690
-It's too late, Adrian.
-No, it's...

26:48.781 --> 26:50.434
No.

26:55.091 --> 26:57.441
Okay.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.792
Charlotte... Charlotte.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.099
Maybe you won't be with me,

27:03.143 --> 27:06.233
but you keep down this path...

27:06.276 --> 27:09.105
you'll be done,
I'm telling you, you'll be done.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.199
I loved you, too...

27:17.244 --> 27:19.463
Adrian.

27:19.507 --> 27:22.075
The only man.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.991
But that's not enough.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.300
Goodbye.

27:44.358 --> 27:45.925
<i>The choice is historic.</i>

27:45.968 --> 27:47.927
<i>Kamala Harris is
the first African American</i>

27:47.970 --> 27:50.451
<i>vice-presidential candidate
in American history.</i>

27:50.494 --> 27:52.845
Wow.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.196
Hey, that's bad for Adrian,
though, isn't it?

27:57.240 --> 27:59.373
Oh... yeah.

27:59.416 --> 28:03.290
Yeah. They only need one
Black face on that stage in '24.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.031
Mm-hmm.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.947
Maybe we should invite him
to stay on as partner?

28:07.990 --> 28:09.775
Hmm. I don't know.

28:09.818 --> 28:13.126
I was liking the idea of
a all-female firm, weren't you?

28:14.170 --> 28:15.911
Uh, yeah, I...

28:15.955 --> 28:17.783
I was.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.349
You know, if it-- if it works.

28:22.352 --> 28:25.573
Uh, let's look again
at which associates to fire.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.924
I'm worried we're losing
too many African Americans.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.578
Black.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.493
You can just say Black people.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.060
Oh. Right.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.844
Black. Thank you.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.977
Why do I give a shit
about summary judgments?

28:38.020 --> 28:39.326
<i>Because you are a 1L.</i>

28:39.369 --> 28:40.980
But the whole point is
to win in court.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.809
<i>Yes, but you have to figure out
how to win.</i>

28:43.852 --> 28:46.159
-I win by fucking them up. <i>
-Marissa.</i>

28:46.202 --> 28:48.117
I know that you know
how to play the game,

28:48.161 --> 28:50.946
but you have to pass the bar
to get in a position

28:50.990 --> 28:52.078
to play the game.

28:52.121 --> 28:53.514
-But all these other 1
-Ls
are idiots.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.820
And the teachers...

28:54.863 --> 28:56.212
If I kill someone tonight,

28:56.256 --> 28:58.040
I will hire you to defend me.

28:58.084 --> 29:02.044
But only if you get a degree
and pass the bar.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.831
Really? You'd hire me
if you killed someone?

29:05.874 --> 29:08.007
I might go out tonight
and kill someone.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.400
I love you, too.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.576
Why are you leaving
here? I'll miss you.

29:12.620 --> 29:15.014
Because they won't pay me
what I deserve.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.842
Anyway,
I thought they fired you.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.452
But they didn't mean it.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.193
It's like the smoothie place--
they kept trying to fire me,

29:20.236 --> 29:21.542
and I just kept showing up.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.022
<i>Then why don't you...</i>

29:23.065 --> 29:24.371
come over to England?

29:24.414 --> 29:26.373
We can work together.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.592
<i>I mean, people over here,
they are weird</i>

29:28.636 --> 29:29.637
about me.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.378
I mean, they love me.

29:31.421 --> 29:33.032
Well, you're lovable.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.990
No, this is something else.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.036
They like that I'm Black
and American.

29:37.079 --> 29:38.080
I'm exotic.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.125
I want to be exotic.

29:39.168 --> 29:40.300
<i>So come over here.</i>

29:40.343 --> 29:41.605
No, I'll just be Jewish.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.129
The Brits don't like Jews.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.219
Uh-oh.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.525
I have this news feed alarm
for American news.

29:48.569 --> 29:51.180
Whenever I hear that ding,
I know that it's bad.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.921
Well, maybe it'll be good
this time.

29:56.011 --> 29:57.186
No.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.059
So, the oral arguments are done

30:00.102 --> 30:01.582
over teleconferencing
these days.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.497
You'll talk into
this camera here.

30:03.540 --> 30:04.890
-That one?
-Yes.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.587
And there are home Zoom screens

30:06.630 --> 30:09.068
of the Supreme Court justices
on these three screens.

30:09.111 --> 30:10.896
And the Chief Justice is

30:10.939 --> 30:11.897
-on this screen.
-Okay.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.507
-And they can see me?
-Yes.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.030
-Do you want to see yourself?
-No.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.075
Okay.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.251
-Who's this?
-Oh. My husband.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.079
-Hi. Leopold.
-Kurt.

30:20.122 --> 30:21.471
No! Don't shake hands.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.257
I'm sorry about this, Kurt.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.128
We're setting up
for oral arguments.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.478
Do you want the guns
in the background?

30:29.523 --> 30:31.003
Yes.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.657
They think that makes me seem
like less of a nut.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.050
-Maybe you should have a...

30:35.094 --> 30:36.704
...ammunition belt
over your shoulder.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.532
Thank you, Kurt.

30:38.575 --> 30:39.925
Hey, Diane.

30:39.968 --> 30:42.492
-Hmm?
-Sir, please. Can you step away?

30:43.537 --> 30:45.147
I need a minute with my wife.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.151
Yeah, can you grab that light,
move it over there?

30:49.195 --> 30:50.283
Close the door.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.113
What?

31:07.213 --> 31:08.388
Oh, no.

31:08.431 --> 31:11.217
-I'll send them away.
-Oh, no.

31:11.260 --> 31:14.394
-2020 just won't let go.

31:14.437 --> 31:16.135
I'm so sorry.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.312
Oh, no.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.142
It's over.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.622
He gets to nominate someone.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.537
Another Kavanaugh.

31:27.581 --> 31:30.758
We'll have a conservative court
for the next 20 years--

31:30.801 --> 31:33.326
-my whole fucking life!

31:33.369 --> 31:35.328
We're all set.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.765
They don't want
an oral argument now,

31:37.808 --> 31:39.549
-not with RBG gone.

31:39.593 --> 31:40.550
Ms. Lockhart.
-Give us a minute.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.770
Oh, babe.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.337
I don't deserve you.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.121
Oh, stop.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.994
You don't agree with me.

31:49.037 --> 31:51.735
I can still feel bad for you.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.785
What do we do?

31:57.828 --> 31:59.526
They're killing us.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.354
Who are they killing?

32:01.397 --> 32:04.400
Black men, women, the young.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.359
What do we do?

32:06.402 --> 32:10.363
Talk. Understand. Unite.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.234
Even with white supremacists?

32:12.278 --> 32:14.193
I would unite with anybody
to do right,

32:14.236 --> 32:15.455
with nobody to do wrong.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.065
Mm, no.
Why am I talking to you?

32:17.109 --> 32:18.371
You're just
a <i>Soul Train</i> commercial.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.590
What about me?

32:22.331 --> 32:23.767
Karl Marx?

32:23.811 --> 32:25.378
I'm guessing you're
from a college extension course

32:25.421 --> 32:26.509
I took on economics.

32:26.553 --> 32:27.771
Why don't people think

32:27.815 --> 32:29.425
I am about more
than economics, huh?

32:29.469 --> 32:32.515
-I have a life, too.
-But you can't tell me nothing

32:32.559 --> 32:34.169
about Black people
being killed now.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.475
And what about me?

32:35.518 --> 32:37.390
You're from my mother.

32:37.433 --> 32:38.782
That's why you're here.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.262
So, you don't believe in me?

32:41.307 --> 32:43.787
I guess I do
because you're here.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.311
-Can I say something?
-Yeah.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.400
-You're Jesus. Go ahead.
-I'm a historical figure,

32:47.443 --> 32:49.402
like Napoleon or Cicero.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.230
So I don't understand
why people have to talk

32:51.273 --> 32:52.753
about believing in me.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.581
Because you're an opium
for the masses.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.148
See, that is such nonsense.
I am the salvation...

32:58.237 --> 33:00.674
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me ask you...

33:01.718 --> 33:04.286
What do I do about George Floyd?

33:08.551 --> 33:11.119
Whoa, hold up, hold up,
hold up. Please, please.

33:11.163 --> 33:12.860
Please, please, please, please.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.254
When else can I get you three
together?

33:15.297 --> 33:16.516
Four.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.780
Okay, good.

33:19.823 --> 33:21.260
That fills a poker table.

33:21.303 --> 33:22.609
The four of you.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.177
What do I do about George Floyd?

33:25.220 --> 33:27.266
-Wait, wait!

33:27.309 --> 33:29.616
Wait, you all are talking
at the same time.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.619
Jay is right.
Let's start chronologically.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.621
-Jesus Christ.
-Thank you.

33:34.664 --> 33:37.711
The key is to avoid
the violence.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.583
Violence poisons
the perpetrator,

33:40.627 --> 33:42.629
but it also poisons the cause.

33:43.978 --> 33:48.591
-Karl.
-This is all about the upper
class versus the lower.

33:48.635 --> 33:52.856
Race is just an avatar
for issues of class.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.467
-Malcolm?
-It is criminal

33:54.510 --> 33:56.338
to teach a man
not to defend himself

33:56.382 --> 33:58.601
when he is the constant victim
of brutal attacks.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.168
And these are brutal attacks.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.691
-Brutal attacks? Brutal attacks?
Now, wait a minute.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.476
So you would have Jay lash out?

34:03.519 --> 34:05.043
No.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.610
But until the oppressors
are ready to follow you, Jesus,

34:07.654 --> 34:09.743
or even you, Mr. Douglass,

34:09.786 --> 34:10.787
Jay...

34:11.875 --> 34:14.661
...you need to fight
the oppressor.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.842
This is your test.

34:29.589 --> 34:30.720
<i>So, we're looking at Arizona,</i>

34:30.764 --> 34:32.679
<i>more to the West Coast,
obviously,</i>

34:32.722 --> 34:36.422
<i>where you can see Joe Biden is
right now 34,035 votes ahead.</i>

34:36.465 --> 34:38.380
<i>can Biden hold on to this lead?</i>

34:38.424 --> 34:39.555
Kurt, you don't
have to stay here.

34:39.599 --> 34:40.904
Watch Fox in the other room.

34:40.948 --> 34:43.864
I'm fine.
I think you need it more.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.518
<i>It would be the first time
this red state</i>

34:45.561 --> 34:47.520
<i>has turned blue since 1996.</i>

34:47.563 --> 34:49.391
Yes, but,
Kurt, if you stay,

34:49.435 --> 34:51.872
I know this isn't sensible,
but...

34:51.915 --> 34:53.308
Trump seems to get more votes

34:53.352 --> 34:54.744
whenever you're sitting
on this couch.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.442
Are you serious?

34:56.485 --> 34:59.358
I am so deathly serious.

34:59.401 --> 35:02.491
Whenever you're sitting here,
Arizona goes for Trump.

35:03.579 --> 35:06.452
Humor me, please.
Just go in the other room.

35:07.496 --> 35:09.237
No, no, no. No kiss.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.587
If you kiss me,
we'll lose Georgia.

35:11.631 --> 35:14.373
Uh, if you lose,
we'll be fine, right?

35:14.416 --> 35:15.722
Kurt, let me just say this.

35:15.765 --> 35:18.855
I'm only saying
that we won't be fine

35:18.899 --> 35:21.380
so that the universe
will grant me a win.

35:21.423 --> 35:22.990
Understood.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.993
<i>Phoenix voted for a Republican
candidate every election</i>

35:26.036 --> 35:27.821
<i>since 1952.</i>

35:27.864 --> 35:29.605
<i>That means you have to go back
to Harry Truman</i>

35:29.649 --> 35:31.607
<i>to find the last time
it went blue.</i>

35:31.651 --> 35:34.654
<i>-Will 2020 be the year
that Maricopa changes?</i>

35:34.697 --> 35:37.309
<i>Will it be enough for Biden
to win it all, or...</i>

35:37.352 --> 35:39.485
-Here.
-That's the...

35:39.528 --> 35:41.226
that's the champagne
from the back of the fridge?

35:41.269 --> 35:43.619
-Yeah.
-That was for when Hillary won.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.231
I-I can only drink it
if Biden wins.

35:46.274 --> 35:49.321
It's odd you progressives
resisted religion.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.975
You seem to have a hundred
religions to take its place.

35:52.019 --> 35:54.413
Go away, Trump.
I mean, Kurt.

35:54.456 --> 35:55.718
I'm going.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.417
Uh, love me even if,
uh, you lose.

35:58.460 --> 35:59.983
<i>...it's called Maricopa County,</i>

36:00.027 --> 36:02.943
<i>located in the South Central
part of the state.</i>

36:02.986 --> 36:05.032
-I'll think about it! <i>
-Moving over to
Pennsylvania now.</i>

36:05.075 --> 36:08.427
<i>Right now, Trump is up
by about 130,000 votes,</i>

36:08.470 --> 36:10.951
<i>but the most Democratic counties
are still out.</i>

36:10.994 --> 36:13.519
<i>does Biden have enough votes</i>

36:13.562 --> 36:14.824
<i>to make up the difference?</i>

36:14.868 --> 36:16.304
<i>As the night wears on,</i>

36:16.348 --> 36:17.958
<i>we see that Diane has found
more pockets</i>

36:18.001 --> 36:20.395
<i>of blue blood cells
in Pennsylvania,</i>

36:20.439 --> 36:22.832
<i>and fewer red blood cells
in these regions.</i>

36:22.876 --> 36:24.573
<i>You'll see here,</i>

36:24.617 --> 36:27.272
<i>right around the red blood clot
blocking the coronary artery.</i>

36:27.315 --> 36:28.751
<i>That is what local officials</i>

36:28.795 --> 36:30.971
call the myocardial infarction.

36:31.014 --> 36:33.800
And as you see here,
bringing it up again,

36:33.843 --> 36:35.628
<i>I bring up
the right heart valve.</i>

36:35.671 --> 36:38.457
<i>The coronary arteries bring
blood and oxygen to the heart.</i>

36:38.500 --> 36:40.459
-Oh, my God. <i>
-If the blood flow is blocked,</i>

36:40.502 --> 36:42.635
the heart is starved of oxygen
and heart cells die.

36:42.678 --> 36:45.290
So Biden needs to win
the commonwealth

36:45.333 --> 36:46.726
of the right ventricle,

36:46.769 --> 36:49.772
<i>or Diane will have
a coronary event of some kind.</i>

36:49.816 --> 36:51.426
Okay, God.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.646
<i>If the blue blood cells
of the inferior vein...</i>

36:53.689 --> 36:55.561
You know I don't believe in you,

36:55.604 --> 36:57.650
but I will believe in you
if Joe Biden wins.

36:57.693 --> 37:00.087
<i>...then the district of Lockhart
will avoid a myocardial...</i>

37:00.130 --> 37:02.829
I'm sorry. I know that
that's not what Jesus taught.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.831
There's nothing in
the New Testament that says,

37:04.874 --> 37:07.442
"Believe in me, and I'll
make sure your candidate wins,"

37:07.486 --> 37:09.531
but I need Joe Biden to win.

37:09.575 --> 37:13.492
I'm sorry, God, but I just do.

37:13.535 --> 37:15.015
<i>...locked in a basement
in Delaware...</i>

37:15.058 --> 37:16.930
I need some faith.

37:17.974 --> 37:20.020
Anything?

37:20.063 --> 37:21.587
Military votes in Arizona.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.893
Georgia thinks they'll be done
counting votes tonight.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.504
Oh, I thought you were
checking in on Jay.

37:25.547 --> 37:26.853
Oh, no, sorry.

37:26.896 --> 37:27.854
He was texting me.

37:27.897 --> 37:28.942
I think he's getting out today.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.858
All rise.

37:31.901 --> 37:34.556
The Honorable Judge
Trig Mullaney presiding.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.864
It is like I am being smothered
in these things. You can sit.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.606
Do we have a new president yet?

37:40.649 --> 37:42.738
-Not as yet, Your Honor.
-Well,

37:42.782 --> 37:45.045
whatever they say about Trump,
he was good for the courts.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.700
Anyway, I've made my decision
on this case--

37:47.743 --> 37:49.615
the, uh... the bribery one.

37:49.658 --> 37:53.096
Oh. Do you want us to stand,
Your Honor?

37:54.402 --> 37:57.057
I thought you were.
Yes, I do.

37:59.102 --> 38:02.715
So, bribery is a bad thing,

38:02.758 --> 38:05.718
and the state can't condone it.
Neither can I.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.415
"Nee-ther," "ni-ther."

38:07.459 --> 38:08.416
"Nee-ther" can...

38:08.460 --> 38:09.635
"Ni-ther" can I?

38:09.678 --> 38:12.028
"Ni-ther" sounds better, right?
"Ni-ther."

38:12.072 --> 38:13.552
-Neither can I.
-I have a sick feeling.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.423
-Either way we appeal.
-So, that...

38:15.467 --> 38:16.859
is why I find you guilty

38:16.903 --> 38:18.905
and sentence you
to seven years in prison.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.863
We plan to appeal, Your Honor.

38:20.907 --> 38:22.778
Yep. Yep. Go for it.

38:22.822 --> 38:25.564
Anyway, that's it, I guess.

38:25.607 --> 38:27.174
Thank you. Have a nice day.

38:27.217 --> 38:28.784
-Oh-oh, my God. Seven years?
-Don't worry.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.569
-Julius...
-Seven years?

38:30.612 --> 38:32.092
-We're going to appeal.
Don't-don't worry.
-Seven years?

38:32.135 --> 38:33.746
-Tell my wife.
-I will. I will.

38:33.789 --> 38:34.921
-But, Julius, don't worry.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.009
Why not?

38:36.052 --> 38:37.097
<i>It is official.</i>

38:37.140 --> 38:39.534
By a 306 to 232 margin,

38:39.578 --> 38:43.059
<i>the Electoral College has made
Joe Biden president-elect.</i>

38:43.103 --> 38:46.019
<i>Vice President Mike Pence will
preside over the certification</i>

38:46.062 --> 38:48.195
<i>according to the Electoral
Count Act of 1877...</i>

38:48.238 --> 38:50.110
You opening it now?

38:50.153 --> 38:52.678
<i>Now many eyes will look to
the date of January 6,</i>

38:52.721 --> 38:55.594
<i>when a joint session of Congress
counts the electoral votes.</i>

38:55.637 --> 38:58.161
<i>-Many expect
a contentious debate.
-Nope.</i>

38:58.205 --> 39:01.861
If I open it now,
something bad will happen.

39:01.904 --> 39:04.124
I've waited four years.

39:04.167 --> 39:05.778
I can wait another few weeks.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.083
<i>The former vice president will
take the oath of...</i>

39:07.127 --> 39:09.042
Lucca,

39:09.085 --> 39:11.087
this firm doesn't want
to lose you.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.655
This is the best
and final offer.

39:13.699 --> 39:16.615
We can't afford to get into
a bidding war with Bianca,

39:16.658 --> 39:18.747
so we're going to need
a yes or no answer from you

39:18.791 --> 39:20.445
by the end of this call.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.185
Okay.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.970
I'm ready.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.667
With Adrian leaving,

39:25.711 --> 39:28.148
we have one spot open
for an equity partner.

39:28.191 --> 39:29.976
We will give it to you.

39:30.019 --> 39:33.066
You will be the youngest
equity partner

39:33.109 --> 39:34.676
in the history of this firm.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.809
And the firm will match
Bianca's offer

39:36.852 --> 39:38.724
of $500,000 a year.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.639
Great.

39:40.682 --> 39:41.770
But again,

39:41.814 --> 39:43.206
we can't have a bidding war.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.078
It's yes or no now.

39:46.122 --> 39:47.646
Lucca, look.

39:47.689 --> 39:49.125
History is being made
right here,

39:49.169 --> 39:50.736
right now in America.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.868
Now, you need to be part of
that, part of that tradition.

39:52.912 --> 39:55.001
England is not yours.

39:55.044 --> 39:56.785
America is.

39:56.829 --> 39:59.658
We are a Black firm, Lucca,

39:59.701 --> 40:01.877
and we need you.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.270
I don't... Wi-Fi is...

40:03.313 --> 40:04.880
<i>-Hello? Hey, guys...?
Lucca?</i>

40:04.924 --> 40:07.579
<i>-Can you... Hello?
-Can you call us back, Lucca?</i>

40:07.622 --> 40:10.233
<i>-Hello? Prob...
-Lucca, if you--
Just call us back.</i>

40:10.277 --> 40:13.149
You think she did that
on purpose?

40:13.193 --> 40:14.499
I would have.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.936
She's probably on with Bianca
right now.

40:16.979 --> 40:19.721
They used George Floyd
because they want you for less.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.071
They have never appreciated you
as much as I do.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.899
<i>All those scars,</i>

40:23.943 --> 40:26.815
<i>all that times being taken
for granted and undervalued</i>

40:26.859 --> 40:28.034
<i>has made you a fighter.</i>

40:28.077 --> 40:30.558
<i>It's made you someone
I now want.</i>

40:30.602 --> 40:31.994
<i>Do you have
your legal pad ready?</i>

40:32.038 --> 40:33.213
Yes.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.868
<i>I don't like bidding,
so here it is.</i>

40:35.911 --> 40:37.870
I want you, Lucca.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.959
$1.3 million.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.657
<i>You are my new CFO.</i>

40:44.964 --> 40:46.705
Go ahead, call them back.

40:46.748 --> 40:49.229
My guess is
they won't be able to beat that.

40:49.272 --> 40:52.711
<i>So it wasn't just
a ton of money, it was CFO.</i>

40:52.754 --> 40:55.757
<i>-And a ton of money.
So this is goodbye?</i>

40:55.801 --> 40:57.629
-I can't believe it. <i>
-It's not goodbye.</i>

40:57.672 --> 40:58.891
<i>I'll be seeing you.</i>

40:58.934 --> 41:00.980
Yeah, but like this,
on a screen.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.938
<i>Marissa, we don't have to work
together to be friends.</i>

41:02.982 --> 41:06.942
<i>-And you're gonna be
a lawyer anyway.
-What?</i>

41:06.986 --> 41:08.683
I've been going to law school.

41:08.727 --> 41:09.945
You're kidding?

41:09.989 --> 41:11.817
Y-- You didn't tell me.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.733
She's been using her time.
You should have, too.

41:14.776 --> 41:16.256
<i>How are you, Jay?</i>

41:16.299 --> 41:17.953
Getting better.

41:17.997 --> 41:21.130
I... lost my taste buds.

41:21.174 --> 41:23.089
<i>It was weird.</i>

41:23.132 --> 41:25.265
And I carry a gun now.

41:25.308 --> 41:26.396
What?

41:27.789 --> 41:28.921
It's performative.

41:29.965 --> 41:32.794
Stay safe, Jay, okay?

41:32.838 --> 41:36.102
-What are we talking about?
COVID or the protests?
-Both.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.234
Give me a ride
on your private jet, Lucca.

41:38.278 --> 41:39.975
When I get one, I will, yes.

41:40.019 --> 41:42.108
<i>I have a-a confession to make.</i>

41:42.151 --> 41:43.109
Sure.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.111
I stole...

41:45.154 --> 41:48.157
your breakfast sandwich
one morning.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.856
<i>You got a-a bagel egg sandwich.</i>

41:50.899 --> 41:53.685
And I said it was Jay
that took it, but it was me.

41:53.728 --> 41:55.034
What a bitch.

41:55.077 --> 41:56.731
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

41:56.775 --> 41:58.864
Your Birkin bag is still here.

41:58.907 --> 42:01.170
<i>I can't believe you just left
this here during COVID.</i>

42:01.214 --> 42:02.998
I had to leave in a rush.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.260
<i>Well, do you want me
to just put it in</i>

42:04.304 --> 42:05.610
<i>with all the other stuff?</i>

42:05.653 --> 42:07.786
No. You keep it.

42:07.829 --> 42:09.004
<i>What? No.</i>

42:09.048 --> 42:10.353
Yeah.

42:11.354 --> 42:12.878
<i>Okay.</i>

42:12.921 --> 42:14.314
<i>-I'm keeping it.</i>

42:14.357 --> 42:15.837
<i>Because of the bagel.</i>

42:15.881 --> 42:17.143
-Think of me when you use it. <i>
-No.</i>

42:17.186 --> 42:21.669
You think of me when I use it.

42:23.671 --> 42:26.021
God, I'm gonna miss you guys.

42:28.328 --> 42:31.113
I'm gonna miss this.

42:32.854 --> 42:35.988
You make me smile.

42:36.031 --> 42:39.644
I didn't smile much
before you guys.

42:39.687 --> 42:43.212
I smiled all the time,
but I didn't mean it.

42:43.256 --> 42:45.214
So then this is goodbye?

42:46.868 --> 42:49.828
I think I'm crying, so probably.

42:50.916 --> 42:53.832
I have to go.
This is getting too emotional.

42:57.923 --> 42:59.054
Goodbye.

42:59.098 --> 43:00.839
Goodbye, Lucca.

43:00.882 --> 43:03.015
You were one of the best.

43:03.058 --> 43:04.886
No.

43:06.192 --> 43:08.455
But together...

43:08.498 --> 43:11.153
we really were.

43:44.447 --> 43:46.754
God, have you ever seen
anything like it?

43:46.798 --> 43:48.234
It's so...

43:48.277 --> 43:50.192
It's so fucked.

43:50.236 --> 43:51.846
But there's a good side.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.805
Trump's people bring,

43:53.848 --> 43:56.024
what, 63 cases
against the election?

43:56.068 --> 43:58.505
They lose 62.

43:58.548 --> 44:02.422
Seems to me the guardrails held
just fine.

44:02.465 --> 44:04.990
-System worked.
-Yay...

44:05.033 --> 44:06.731
Liz. Liz.

44:06.774 --> 44:09.342
Sometimes when things work out,

44:09.385 --> 44:11.083
there is no parade.

44:11.126 --> 44:14.564
There's no congratulations,
but I'll tell you this.

44:16.175 --> 44:17.959
We live to fight another day.

44:18.003 --> 44:20.483
Yeah? Then why are you leaving
the law?

44:20.527 --> 44:22.442
Hmm.

44:23.486 --> 44:25.358
I am moving to Atlanta.

44:27.142 --> 44:29.231
-I'm s-- What?
-What?

44:29.275 --> 44:31.930
I am moving to Atlanta.

44:31.973 --> 44:35.803
I-I read this op-ed
by a man named Charles Blow.

44:35.847 --> 44:39.285
He's talking about Black people
returning to the South

44:39.328 --> 44:44.377
to create and consolidate
real political power.

44:44.420 --> 44:46.858
Those wins in Georgia
inspired him.

44:46.901 --> 44:47.989
-Mm.
-And I'll tell you.

44:48.033 --> 44:50.383
Inspired me, too.

44:50.426 --> 44:52.037
-Have you ever lived there?
-No.

44:52.080 --> 44:55.954
But if today told us anything,
it's about starting over.

44:55.997 --> 44:58.086
I am starting over.

44:58.130 --> 45:00.088
Here's to you.

45:01.829 --> 45:03.178
What about you two?

45:03.222 --> 45:05.485
-Ooh...
-Well, we lost Lucca.

45:05.528 --> 45:08.227
We're losing you. I...

45:09.358 --> 45:13.449
But my guess is that
the-the Biden administration

45:13.493 --> 45:15.364
is gonna be better
for Black businesses,

45:15.408 --> 45:17.410
-so...
Mm-hmm.

45:17.453 --> 45:18.977
Will you replace me?

45:19.020 --> 45:22.241
I think the big question is,
are you replacing me?

45:24.199 --> 45:26.027
Well, I...

45:26.071 --> 45:27.812
It's not my intention.

45:27.855 --> 45:30.031
No.

45:30.075 --> 45:32.077
Well, I can't change
the color of my skin.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.513
I know.

45:33.556 --> 45:36.037
Hey, I'm gonna fight
for my partnership.

45:38.039 --> 45:39.475
I know.

45:40.868 --> 45:42.000
I will leave it there, ladies.

45:43.566 --> 45:45.612
Aw.

45:45.655 --> 45:47.222
Bye, boss.

45:47.266 --> 45:49.529
We're all gonna miss you.

45:49.572 --> 45:51.444
-Come on.

45:52.619 --> 45:54.186
-Mmm...

46:07.547 --> 46:09.375
You sure you know
what you're doing?

46:09.418 --> 46:11.333
No.

46:11.377 --> 46:14.902
But I'm all about improvisation,
right?

46:17.165 --> 46:19.864
-What about you two?
Well, it...

46:19.907 --> 46:21.953
I-It's going to be interesting.

46:21.996 --> 46:23.302
Yes.

46:28.002 --> 46:30.048
Diane is a terrific lawyer,

46:30.091 --> 46:32.137
but this firm belongs to you.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.878
Your dad built it.

46:33.921 --> 46:36.054
Uh, n-- He did, Liz.

46:36.097 --> 46:38.404
Despite all his faults.

46:38.447 --> 46:41.581
You got to run this place
the way you want.

46:41.624 --> 46:45.063
This is a Black firm.

46:45.106 --> 46:47.935
And after today...

46:47.979 --> 46:51.983
the world needs Black firms.

46:52.026 --> 46:53.636
You got me?

46:56.030 --> 46:57.945
I got it.

47:12.655 --> 47:14.440
I'll see you.

47:36.027 --> 47:37.985
-Hey!
-Hey.
-What's up? What's up?

47:38.029 --> 47:38.986
-Hey.
-What you guys doing here?

47:39.030 --> 47:39.987
Packing for Lucca.

47:40.031 --> 47:41.162
It's weird.

47:41.206 --> 47:42.642
Everybody fun is leaving.

47:42.685 --> 47:44.470
-Hey! Hi. Hello.

47:44.513 --> 47:47.038
-Okay, everybody except for us.
-Okay.

47:47.081 --> 47:49.127
-How you doing?
-Uh...

47:49.170 --> 47:51.477
Well, I think I'm what they call
a long-hauler.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.479
-But I'm feeling good.
Oh!

47:53.522 --> 47:55.133
Oh, oh, oh! God!
Wait, wait, wait.

47:55.176 --> 47:56.438
H-Have you guys heard?

47:56.482 --> 47:58.571
-What?
-Well, uh, Trump...

47:58.614 --> 48:01.617
Trump pardoned
all of the convicted

48:01.661 --> 48:04.359
and corrupt Republican
officials.

48:04.403 --> 48:06.492
Makes sense.

48:06.535 --> 48:09.277
And Julius got a pardon, too.

48:09.321 --> 48:10.670
-What?
-Yes.

48:10.713 --> 48:12.367
-Julius?
-Julius.

48:12.411 --> 48:14.761
-You're kidding?
-Oh, my God!
