00:39.778 --> 00:41.341
(Richard)
The trail ends here.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.871
Denna must be in there.

00:43.939 --> 00:45.269
Then what are we waiting for?

00:45.437 --> 00:46.633
If she doesn't have
the compass,

00:46.701 --> 00:48.299
we need to find out
where she's hidden it.

00:48.367 --> 00:50.197
We can't risk
killing her.

00:50.265 --> 00:52.827
Kahlan, if we can draw her out,
you can confess her.

00:52.895 --> 00:54.593

(Richard)
Denna.

01:17.012 --> 01:18.583
See if there are
any survivors.

01:18.616 --> 01:20.383
Help them if you can.

Whoa.

02:10.627 --> 02:13.159
It's not her.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.857
Zedd.

02:22.158 --> 02:25.892
You know your magic is useless
against a Mord-Sith.

What is it you want with me,
Denna?

03:10.543 --> 03:12.310
( screams )

03:12.377 --> 03:15.378
Right now I want you
to cover our tracks.

03:17.645 --> 03:19.845
( screaming )

03:19.913 --> 03:21.646
All right! All right.

03:21.714 --> 03:23.481
Enough.

03:35.055 --> 03:37.422
Keep moving, Wizard.

Zedd groaning )

04:03.905 --> 04:06.205
Good work, Zedd.

04:06.272 --> 04:07.872
We're on the right track.

Richard.

04:16.644 --> 04:19.346
Richard.

04:19.413 --> 04:20.846
What's happening to him?

04:20.915 --> 04:22.381
I don't know.

04:22.449 --> 04:24.283
Maybe it's something
Denna did.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.051
This is no Mord-Sith magic.

04:26.119 --> 04:27.352
( grunts )

04:27.420 --> 04:29.954
Zedd would know what to do.

04:30.022 --> 04:31.656
(woman)
He won't be able to help him.

04:32.958 --> 04:33.958
Only we can.

04:36.827 --> 04:38.628
You're Sisters of the Light.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.830
I'm Sister Verna.

04:40.897 --> 04:43.065
This is Sister Katharine
and Sister Elizabeth.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.266
What's happening to him?

04:44.334 --> 04:47.169
The Wizard in him is awakening.

04:50.973 --> 04:53.507
Wizard?
What are you talking about?

04:53.575 --> 04:56.043
Twenty-four years ago,
we received a prophecy

04:56.111 --> 04:58.380
that a great Wizard
would be born in Brennidon.

04:58.447 --> 05:00.615
And we've been searching for you
ever since.

05:00.683 --> 05:02.050
(Verna)
When we arrived in Brennidon,

05:02.118 --> 05:04.153
the people said
that you'd been killed.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.886
But still we kept searching.

05:06.953 --> 05:08.921
I've been back in the Midlands
for over a year now.

05:08.988 --> 05:12.824
Until a few weeks ago, we were
rotting in a D'Haran prison.

05:12.892 --> 05:15.259
(Katharine)
But all the suffering
was worth it,

05:15.327 --> 05:18.695
because now we've found you.

05:18.763 --> 05:20.530
You've been having these
headaches for a while,

05:20.598 --> 05:22.565
haven't you?

05:22.633 --> 05:25.368
And they've been
getting worse.

05:25.435 --> 05:26.836
Richard,
why didn't you say anything?

05:26.904 --> 05:27.970
I didn't want to worry you.

05:28.038 --> 05:29.973
You said you could help him.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.407
Do it.

05:31.475 --> 05:32.909
It's not that simple.

05:32.977 --> 05:36.807
The headaches are a result of
the han bottling up inside him.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.142
(Richard)
Han?

05:38.209 --> 05:40.943
Han is the magic
that flows through the veins

05:41.011 --> 05:42.144
of all Wizards.

05:42.212 --> 05:44.279
I'm not-- Unh.

05:47.148 --> 05:48.915
I'm not a Wizard.

05:48.983 --> 05:50.150
You are the union
of two bloodlines

05:50.217 --> 05:52.085
that possess very strong magic.

05:52.153 --> 05:54.155
Rahl and Zorander.

05:54.222 --> 05:57.324
Your han is so powerful,

05:57.391 --> 05:59.425
if you don't
learn to use it,

05:59.493 --> 06:00.859
it will kill you.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.194
It is only by the hand
of the Creator

06:03.262 --> 06:05.328
that we found you in time.

06:05.396 --> 06:08.064
You must come with us
to the Palace of the Prophets.

06:08.131 --> 06:10.799
Only there can we teach you
to control it.

06:10.867 --> 06:12.835
(Katharine)
That is the duty
of the Sisters of the Light.

06:12.903 --> 06:16.806
To instruct young Wizards
to master their gift.

06:16.874 --> 06:19.443
Where is this
Palace of the Prophets?

06:19.510 --> 06:21.312
In the Old World.

06:25.449 --> 06:27.917
How long will it take to get
Richard there and cure him?

06:27.984 --> 06:30.319
I'm not certain.
But we don't have much time.

06:30.387 --> 06:32.888
You must leave with us
immediately.

06:32.956 --> 06:34.623
I'm not
going anywhere.

06:34.691 --> 06:36.325
We already have a Wizard,

06:36.393 --> 06:39.795
and I gotta get him back.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.264
Richard.
( screams )

06:43.332 --> 06:45.935
( screaming )

06:48.672 --> 06:51.208
It's worse
than we feared.

06:54.579 --> 06:56.680
( Richard panting )

07:02.251 --> 07:05.752
<i>( ethereal theme playing )</i>

07:12.024 --> 07:14.125
The pain.

07:14.193 --> 07:16.561
It's gone.

07:19.932 --> 07:21.899
What's wrong with her?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.702
She's dead.

07:33.308 --> 07:36.577
Sister Elizabeth
took your pain upon herself...

07:38.112 --> 07:39.646
and it was so great
that it killed her.

07:39.713 --> 07:40.946
Why would she do that?

07:41.014 --> 07:44.482
The Sisters of the Light
are sworn to protect you.

07:44.550 --> 07:47.151
And die for you, if necessary.

07:47.219 --> 07:49.186
I don't want anybody
dying for me.

07:49.254 --> 07:50.387
Give her
the Breath of Life.

07:50.455 --> 07:54.325
No. You've seen
how powerful the han is.

07:54.393 --> 07:56.894
Even the small amount
still inside Sister Elizabeth

07:56.962 --> 07:58.829
would kill your Mord-Sith.

07:58.897 --> 08:02.132
And eventually it will kill you.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.068
But she cured me.

08:04.136 --> 08:06.038
It's not a cure.

08:06.105 --> 08:10.842
The pain will return,
and worse than before.

08:10.910 --> 08:14.412
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

08:14.480 --> 08:15.814
Richard,
you have to go with them.

08:15.881 --> 08:18.016
I won't leave you.
I won't leave Zedd.

08:18.084 --> 08:19.584
Cara and I
will find Zedd.

08:19.652 --> 08:21.052
And the compass.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.318
Your death won't help us
do that.

08:23.386 --> 08:25.052
You're asking me
to give up my quest.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.787
I'm asking you to stay alive.

08:32.325 --> 08:34.259
I can't live
in a world without you.

08:34.327 --> 08:35.260
Kahlan--

08:35.328 --> 08:37.028
Richard.

08:37.096 --> 08:40.732
If you love me,
you'll do this.

08:48.806 --> 08:50.907
All right. I'll go.

08:52.709 --> 08:54.709
And I'm coming with you.

08:54.777 --> 08:56.810
The Sisters of the Light

08:56.878 --> 08:58.578
aren't the only ones
sworn to protect you.

08:59.813 --> 09:01.413
I'll come back as quickly
as I can.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.781
But I need you to go
with Kahlan to find Zedd.

09:03.849 --> 09:07.187
Protect her
as if she were me.

09:08.990 --> 09:12.258
I think it's good
you're leaving.

09:12.326 --> 09:14.493
You'd only
slow us down.

09:18.164 --> 09:20.766
I'll miss you too.

09:23.903 --> 09:27.171
What are you doing?

09:27.239 --> 09:29.338
I don't know
how long I'll be gone.

09:29.406 --> 09:30.839
And you can't wait for me.

09:30.907 --> 09:32.976
Once you've found Zedd
and the compass,

09:33.043 --> 09:35.181
he may have to name a new Seeker
to find the Stone of Tears.

09:35.249 --> 09:36.449
Richard--

09:36.516 --> 09:39.351
The quest is bigger
than just one man.

09:39.419 --> 09:40.552
Take it.

09:47.826 --> 09:51.262
But only until you return.

09:57.734 --> 09:59.235
Something to protect
yourself with.

10:12.215 --> 10:14.516
I love you.

10:14.584 --> 10:16.885
And I will be back.

10:16.953 --> 10:18.754
<i>( tender theme playing )</i>

10:49.963 --> 10:52.631
Richard, for the last time,
you need to slow down.

10:52.699 --> 10:53.999
The sooner we get there,

10:54.067 --> 10:55.367
the sooner I can get back
to my quest.

10:55.434 --> 10:57.635
Getting us lost won't help.

10:57.703 --> 10:59.937
There are many entrances
to the Old World,

11:00.005 --> 11:01.638
but you must know
where to find them.

11:01.706 --> 11:03.173
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

11:03.241 --> 11:05.041
It took you 24 years
to find me.

11:06.911 --> 11:10.612
Well, I assume they call you
"the Seeker" for a reason.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.781
Maybe you can show us the way
to the Old World.

11:12.849 --> 11:14.983
I can't see anything
in this fog.

11:15.051 --> 11:16.985
Once you've finished
your Wizard's training,

11:17.052 --> 11:18.653
you will see things
quite differently.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.158
So, what does this
training involve?

11:24.226 --> 11:25.926
You'll learn everything
you need to know

11:25.994 --> 11:28.162
once we reach
the Palace of the Prophets.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.130
How long does it take
to train a Wizard?

11:32.833 --> 11:34.233
You ask a lot of questions.

11:34.301 --> 11:36.168
Yes. And I'm used to
getting answers.

11:36.236 --> 11:38.804
The training takes as long
as it takes.

11:38.871 --> 11:40.205
Much of that is up to you.

11:40.272 --> 11:42.473
It depends on
how fast you learn.

11:42.541 --> 11:44.942
Well, you'd be surprised
at how fast I can learn.

11:45.009 --> 11:46.343
That's what I'm afraid of.

11:46.411 --> 11:48.079
What? You won't have
the pleasure of my company

11:48.146 --> 11:49.380
for very long?

11:49.448 --> 11:51.382
But you don't understand
the difference

11:51.450 --> 11:52.617
between knowledge and wisdom.

11:52.685 --> 11:55.186
Knowledge is easy to gain.

11:55.254 --> 11:58.657
Wisdom is much harder.

11:58.724 --> 12:01.359
Much harm has come from those
who don't know the difference.

12:01.426 --> 12:03.294
Is she always this much fun
to be around?

12:11.136 --> 12:13.237
We're here.

12:13.305 --> 12:16.073
<i>( majestic theme playing )</i>

12:35.091 --> 12:36.992
( Agiel whines )
( screams )

12:37.060 --> 12:39.093
Time to get moving,
Wizard.

12:39.161 --> 12:42.096
This is pointless.

12:42.163 --> 12:43.931
The compass
is of no use to you.

12:43.998 --> 12:46.699
It only works in the hands
of the Seeker.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.068
You think I care
about this trinket?

12:49.136 --> 12:52.204
The compass was the bait
to catch you.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.539
Think of all I can accomplish

12:54.607 --> 12:56.641
now that I have
a Wizard of the First Order

12:56.709 --> 12:59.077
to do my bidding.

12:59.144 --> 13:02.646
I'm afraid I'll be more useless
to you than that compass.

13:02.713 --> 13:04.614
Not even you can resist

13:04.682 --> 13:07.117
being broken by a Mord-Sith.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.721
You're mistaken.

13:10.788 --> 13:12.789
No.

13:12.857 --> 13:16.291
If you think your friends
are coming to help you,

13:16.359 --> 13:19.127
you're the one who's mistaken.

13:19.195 --> 13:20.595

13:32.538 --> 13:35.273
If you need to stop
and rest...

13:35.340 --> 13:38.442
Is that your way of saying
you need to stop and rest?

13:38.510 --> 13:43.280
No, it's my way of saying
you're slowing us down.

13:43.347 --> 13:45.315
We need to find
the next flower.

13:45.382 --> 13:48.785
I think I have.

13:48.853 --> 13:51.021
The roots are here, but
someone's picked the flower.

14:52.749 --> 14:53.915
( screaming )

15:07.464 --> 15:08.764
(Cara)
You're hurt.

15:08.832 --> 15:10.466
I'm fine.

15:14.504 --> 15:16.606
( grunts )

15:16.673 --> 15:19.609
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

15:23.578 --> 15:25.476
(soldier)
Command me, Confessor.

15:25.544 --> 15:26.744
Denna sent you?

15:26.812 --> 15:29.514
Yes, Confessor.

15:29.582 --> 15:31.282
She said if we killed you,

15:31.350 --> 15:33.717
we'd receive
20 gold pieces each.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.986
And where were you supposed to
collect this payment?

15:39.054 --> 15:40.820
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

15:44.592 --> 15:46.459
If you'd found me
all those years ago

15:46.526 --> 15:47.893
I would have just been
a child.

15:47.961 --> 15:49.928
That's usual when Wizards
begin their training.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.762
It's better that way.
Why?

15:51.830 --> 15:55.265
Because children
do as they're told.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.267
( woman screaming )

15:57.334 --> 16:00.470
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

16:00.538 --> 16:02.038
(Verna)
What happened here?

16:02.106 --> 16:04.140
( flies buzzing )

16:04.208 --> 16:07.743
Whoever did this
was very powerful.

16:09.779 --> 16:12.180
(Richard)
Or whatever.

16:18.085 --> 16:19.952
How can these tracks
just end here?

16:20.019 --> 16:21.986
( creature roars )

16:22.054 --> 16:24.321
It's a Mriswith!
They're invisible.

16:27.424 --> 16:30.525
We have to get out
of here now.

16:30.592 --> 16:32.359
<i>( suspenseful theme playing )</i>

16:42.404 --> 16:44.039
( screaming )

16:50.609 --> 16:52.843
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

16:52.910 --> 16:54.610
Don't be a fool.

16:54.678 --> 16:56.279
When someone is taken
by the Mriswith

16:56.346 --> 16:58.247
they are never seen again.
Never.

16:58.314 --> 17:00.315
If you're not going to help,
get out of the way.

17:02.985 --> 17:04.484
You can't fight them.

17:04.553 --> 17:06.621
You can't even see them.

17:08.089 --> 17:09.690
You've lost the trail.

17:09.758 --> 17:11.224
We have to seek shelter.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.260
And leave your Sister
to these creatures?

17:14.328 --> 17:18.528
Sister Katharine was prepared
to give her life for you,

17:18.596 --> 17:20.396
just like Sister Elizabeth.

17:20.464 --> 17:23.332
You say you don't want
anyone to die for you,

17:23.400 --> 17:25.500
but what about my life?

17:25.568 --> 17:28.469
I've sacrificed half of it
already, searching for you.

17:28.537 --> 17:30.838
And if I have to die out here
without getting you

17:30.906 --> 17:32.239
back to the Palace
of the Prophets,

17:32.307 --> 17:34.174
it will all have been
for nothing.

17:38.179 --> 17:41.214
You failed me.

17:41.281 --> 17:44.349
We escaped so we could warn you
that they were still coming.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.784
Oh.

17:46.852 --> 17:50.688
And for that you feel
you still deserve payment?

17:50.756 --> 17:53.528
And that of the other men who
no longer have use for theirs.

17:53.595 --> 17:55.796
( laughing )

17:55.864 --> 17:57.964
Ve-- Very well.

17:58.032 --> 17:59.833
You'll both be paid in full.

18:03.004 --> 18:04.906
( screaming )

18:04.974 --> 18:06.943
( grunts )

18:08.981 --> 18:11.815
I assume that's
the going rate for failure?

18:14.152 --> 18:16.219
My friends will never stop
coming for you.

18:16.287 --> 18:18.555
They will if they assume
I'm dead.

18:18.623 --> 18:20.725
You arrange that, can't you?

18:20.792 --> 18:22.460
Gladly.

18:22.528 --> 18:25.230
Would a knife
in the belly suffice?

18:29.902 --> 18:31.970
I've given you two corpses.

18:32.037 --> 18:35.436
Surely you can use your magic
to make them look like us.

18:35.504 --> 18:38.571
Oh, I have the magic.

18:38.639 --> 18:41.374
But you don't have the time
to torture me into using it.

18:41.441 --> 18:43.708
You underestimate me, Wizard.

18:45.144 --> 18:48.647
I have more subtle means
of persuasion.

18:55.353 --> 18:56.720
All right!

18:56.788 --> 18:59.588
But I have one condition.

18:59.656 --> 19:01.590
That leave behind
the compass

19:01.658 --> 19:04.525
so that they can continue the
search for the Stone of Tears.

19:04.593 --> 19:06.360
As long as you
keep it from them

19:06.428 --> 19:08.228
they will not stop
searching for it.

19:08.296 --> 19:12.131
And eventually
they'll uncover your ruse.

19:15.135 --> 19:17.703
It's the only way you can
truly be rid of them.

19:21.107 --> 19:23.375
We have a deal, Wizard.

19:23.443 --> 19:25.278
( sighs )

19:28.784 --> 19:31.218
( Zedd chanting
in ancient tongue )

19:48.500 --> 19:50.033
(Verna)
These are the Majendie.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.335
They're allies
of the Sisters of Light.

19:55.606 --> 19:58.875
You must be exhausted
after your ordeal.

19:58.943 --> 20:01.144
If there's anything
we can do for you...

20:01.212 --> 20:02.745
You could lend me
some of your men

20:02.813 --> 20:04.213
to help me search
for Sister Katharine.

20:04.281 --> 20:06.048
It's too late.

20:06.116 --> 20:08.450
Looking for her would only
lead to more death.

20:08.518 --> 20:10.252
The Mriswith have swarmed
this area.

20:10.319 --> 20:13.488
When I left the Old World,
they were nearly extinct.

20:13.556 --> 20:14.756
Somehow they've increased
their numbers.

20:14.823 --> 20:17.091
That's impossible.

20:17.159 --> 20:19.260
To control
the Mriswith's numbers,

20:19.327 --> 20:20.728
the Wizards who created them

20:20.795 --> 20:22.396
made them incapable
of reproducing.

20:22.463 --> 20:24.531
Created?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.965
For what?

20:26.033 --> 20:28.467
During the darkest hour
of the Great Wizards' War,

20:28.535 --> 20:30.236
when all was lost,

20:30.303 --> 20:32.304
a group of Wizards
nobly volunteered

20:32.372 --> 20:34.873
to be transformed into a vicious
fighting force.

20:34.974 --> 20:37.776
Because of their sacrifice,
the tide was turned.

20:37.843 --> 20:40.778
They won the war,
but lost their souls forever.

20:40.846 --> 20:43.080
Bloodlust is all they know.

20:45.083 --> 20:48.392
They're nesting in the
Lurra Caves, and from there,

20:48.460 --> 20:50.231
they've been attacking
our trade routes.

20:50.299 --> 20:52.266
And the road to the Palace
of the Prophets?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.468
Impassable.

20:54.536 --> 20:56.537
Captain Takoda,
we don't have much time.

20:56.604 --> 20:58.439
I have to get Richard there.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.107
Are you a Wizard?

21:00.175 --> 21:02.376
Yes.
No.

21:03.778 --> 21:05.979
Not yet.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.448
He's on his way to be trained
in the gift.

21:08.516 --> 21:11.684
Then perhaps when you
return from the Palace,

21:11.752 --> 21:13.620
you can help us eradicate
the Mriswith.

21:13.688 --> 21:15.323
I have to get there first.

21:19.161 --> 21:21.162
There is one way.

21:23.098 --> 21:24.565
( man coughing )

21:24.633 --> 21:27.568
These Baka-Ban dogs have been
raiding our village.

21:27.636 --> 21:29.537
Liar!
We came here to make peace!

21:31.340 --> 21:33.508
There's a rock
half a league from here.

21:33.576 --> 21:36.111
Take a few ot hese prisoners
and chain them to it.

21:36.179 --> 21:37.846
The Mriswith will be
drawn to them,

21:37.914 --> 21:39.481
which should allow you to pass

21:39.549 --> 21:42.151
through their territory
unharmed.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.852
(woman)
Get your hands off me.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.488
( spits )

21:48.192 --> 21:49.993
I'm not sacrificing anyone.

21:52.263 --> 21:53.797
Then you will not make it

21:53.865 --> 21:57.001
to the Palace of the Prophets
alive.

21:57.068 --> 21:59.103
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

22:00.200 --> 22:02.167
We have to take
the prisoners

22:02.335 --> 22:04.670
to draw the Mriswith
away from us.

22:04.737 --> 22:05.904
You believe
in the Creator,

22:05.972 --> 22:07.373
but you'd willingly
let those people die?

22:07.440 --> 22:09.241
They're an acceptable loss.

22:09.309 --> 22:10.909
Think their lives
are worth less than mine?

22:10.977 --> 22:14.245
There are so few Wizards left
in the world, Richard.

22:14.313 --> 22:16.614
I don't care about
becoming a Wizard.

22:16.681 --> 22:18.750
( groans )

22:24.657 --> 22:26.324
( breathing heavily )

22:26.392 --> 22:28.226
I'm only coming with you
to get rid of this pain.

22:28.294 --> 22:30.829
But you're so much more
than that.

22:30.897 --> 22:34.567
By learning to use your powers,
you could save many more people.

22:34.634 --> 22:36.436
You could eradicate the Mriswith
once and for all

22:36.503 --> 22:39.539
and make it so that no one else
has to die at their hands.

22:39.606 --> 22:41.574
Yes. Starting with
these prisoners.

22:41.642 --> 22:43.443
And who are they to you

22:43.511 --> 22:45.579
that you would risk everything
to save them?

22:45.647 --> 22:48.349
They're people
being fed to monsters.

22:48.417 --> 22:49.517
I'm going to stop it.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.152
No, I won't allow you
to do that.

22:52.220 --> 22:53.187
Yes, you will.

22:53.254 --> 22:54.889
And if you want me to come

22:54.956 --> 22:56.123
to the Palace
of the Prophets,

22:56.191 --> 22:58.292
you will help me.

23:05.067 --> 23:06.200
( metal slicing )

23:07.669 --> 23:10.003
( both scream )

23:11.305 --> 23:13.305
The Dacras contain
powerful magic.

23:13.373 --> 23:15.107
If you don't do exactly
as we say,

23:15.174 --> 23:16.407
I will release it
and you will die.

23:16.475 --> 23:17.374
Drop your weapons.

23:20.711 --> 23:21.945
Now release
the prisoners.

23:22.012 --> 23:23.379
Come on.

23:23.447 --> 23:24.881
( keys rattle )

23:24.949 --> 23:27.150
( hinges squeak )

23:27.218 --> 23:28.618
Go, go.

23:30.286 --> 23:31.252
Go, go, go.

23:33.722 --> 23:34.855
May the Spirits
bless you.

23:37.424 --> 23:38.757
( grunts )

23:42.060 --> 23:43.327
(Richard)
Into the cells.

23:45.297 --> 23:46.463
( grunts )

23:52.168 --> 23:53.768
(Richard)
Let's move.

24:02.974 --> 24:04.508
( grunts )

24:05.943 --> 24:07.576
You should keep going.

24:07.644 --> 24:09.311
You'll move faster alone.

24:09.378 --> 24:10.445
Obviously.

24:13.215 --> 24:15.115
But I made a promise
to Richard.

24:15.183 --> 24:16.983
( groaning )

24:17.051 --> 24:18.852
It's infected.

24:21.287 --> 24:23.054
We need to burn the wound
closed.

24:23.122 --> 24:24.622
We don't have time
to make a fire.

24:26.624 --> 24:29.726
I don't need a fire.

24:31.395 --> 24:32.562
But it will hurt.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.099
I've been struck
by an Agiel before.

24:36.536 --> 24:37.369
Not like this.

24:38.538 --> 24:39.938
Do it.

24:48.647 --> 24:50.481
( Agiel whining )

24:59.159 --> 25:01.527
( panting )

25:01.595 --> 25:04.496
Hm, I'm impressed.

25:04.563 --> 25:07.564
Even the strongest Mord-Sith
would've fainted.

25:12.701 --> 25:13.768
Kahlan?

25:15.336 --> 25:16.770
(Richard)
You know, for someone who says

25:16.837 --> 25:19.571
she came to make peace with the
Majendie, that was some punch.

25:19.639 --> 25:21.038
The Majendie
lied to us.

25:21.106 --> 25:23.640
They lured us to their town
with talk of peace.

25:23.708 --> 25:27.443
I led 50 of my people here
to negotiate a treaty,

25:27.510 --> 25:30.045
so they could use us as bait
for the Mriswith.

25:30.113 --> 25:33.581
We're all that's left.

25:33.648 --> 25:36.716
We prayed for the Spirits to
send the one who would save us.

25:36.784 --> 25:39.619
My people call him
the Cahairn.

25:39.687 --> 25:40.853
It's you.

25:40.921 --> 25:42.922
( chuckles )

25:42.990 --> 25:44.557
Something funny?

25:44.625 --> 25:47.194
Oh, you think
I'm the Cahairn,

25:47.262 --> 25:49.096
she thinks I'm a Wizard,

25:49.164 --> 25:51.065
where I'm from
they call me the Seeker.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.102
But you can just call me
Richard.

25:54.170 --> 25:56.304
I'm Du' Challu.

25:56.372 --> 25:58.506
Thank you for rescuing us.

25:58.573 --> 26:02.141
If we can get you back to your
home, would you be safe there?

26:02.208 --> 26:03.608
Yes.

26:03.676 --> 26:05.309
Our village is protected
from the Mriswith.

26:05.377 --> 26:06.677
How do we get there?

26:06.745 --> 26:08.344
It's just across the river.

26:08.412 --> 26:11.246
But the Majendie destroyed
the only bridge.

26:11.314 --> 26:12.980
Is there somewhere else
we can cross?

26:13.048 --> 26:14.748
At the mud flats.

26:14.816 --> 26:16.315
Past the Lurra Caves?

26:16.383 --> 26:19.316
That's where Captain Takoda
said the Mriswith are nesting.

26:23.787 --> 26:25.287
Where are the prisoners?

26:25.354 --> 26:26.621
They took them and fled.

26:26.689 --> 26:29.089
They could be halfway
to their village by now.

26:29.157 --> 26:30.390
Then we need
to get them back.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.591
What about the Mriswith?
They'll slaughter us.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.193
And if we don't recapture
the prisoners,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.228
we'll be trapped inside
our own city.

26:36.296 --> 26:38.663
We need those prisoners
to distract the creatures.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.464
Yes, but sir,

26:40.532 --> 26:42.066
who will distract them
from us?

26:46.204 --> 26:47.671
This is it.

26:47.739 --> 26:51.243
This is where the D'Harans
were supposed to meet Denna.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.845
Zedd.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.712
Zedd.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.680
Zedd!

26:58.748 --> 27:00.349
Zedd.

27:04.186 --> 27:06.319
No.

27:06.387 --> 27:07.921
Looks like he was able
to stab her

27:07.989 --> 27:10.591
before she could kill him
with her Agiel.

27:17.033 --> 27:18.400
( sobbing )

27:23.171 --> 27:24.338
The Wizard fought well.

27:30.246 --> 27:32.114
He got us the compass back.

27:33.650 --> 27:35.017
( sighs )

27:42.691 --> 27:45.459
How am I going to tell Richard?

27:53.568 --> 27:54.601
What is it?

27:58.238 --> 27:59.105
(Takoda)
Stop where you are.

28:01.108 --> 28:02.842
We only want
the prisoners back.

28:02.909 --> 28:05.778
Give them to us
and you can go on your way.

28:05.846 --> 28:07.579
So they can be killed
by the Mriswith?

28:07.647 --> 28:09.381
The Majendie have been allies

28:09.449 --> 28:11.584
with the Sisters of the Light
for generations.

28:11.651 --> 28:12.952
They were bonds
forged in battle.

28:13.019 --> 28:14.386
You must--

28:20.426 --> 28:21.526

28:27.798 --> 28:29.599
( glass shatters )

28:29.666 --> 28:31.300
( screaming )

28:35.838 --> 28:37.505
We have to move now.

28:40.542 --> 28:41.975
If you get my people
back home,

28:42.042 --> 28:44.176
then I'll stay behind and draw
the Mriswith away from you.

28:44.244 --> 28:47.111
If not for you, I would've
been killed anyway.

28:47.179 --> 28:49.847
At least this way, my death
will help save my people.

28:49.915 --> 28:52.951
No. It's time
to make a stand.

28:53.019 --> 28:54.319
We're going to fight
the Mriswith.

28:54.387 --> 28:57.689
How can we fight something
we can't even see?

28:57.757 --> 28:59.758
( soldiers screaming )

29:02.093 --> 29:03.527
( birds singing )

29:12.005 --> 29:13.372
I hope you don't expect me
to eat that

29:13.440 --> 29:15.174
without proper
blackberry sauce.

29:15.242 --> 29:18.043
Refusing to eat will only make
the journey harder for you.

29:18.111 --> 29:21.580
I'm touched by your concern
for my well-being,

29:21.648 --> 29:23.215
but why are we going
anywhere?

29:23.283 --> 29:25.550
Why not break me right here?

29:25.618 --> 29:29.121
So your screams can reach
sympathetic ears?

29:29.189 --> 29:33.827
No, I have a more suitable place
in mind for your training.

29:35.294 --> 29:37.262
You have another choice.

29:39.265 --> 29:41.366
You could be merciful.

29:41.434 --> 29:45.271
You think I'll let you go?

29:45.338 --> 29:46.905
Of course not.

29:46.973 --> 29:49.509
But you could give me a swift
death instead of torturing me.

29:49.576 --> 29:53.646
But that's the part
I enjoy the most.

29:53.714 --> 29:57.217
I've given you a new life.
What else do you want?

29:57.285 --> 30:01.388
You can't imagine the things
I want.

30:01.456 --> 30:04.224
And you're going to help me
get them.

30:04.292 --> 30:08.295
You served the Seeker well,
and now you'll serve me.

30:08.362 --> 30:10.630
Never.

30:10.698 --> 30:12.800
( scoffs )

30:12.868 --> 30:16.271
I think you'll find it
quite liberating, Wizard.

30:16.338 --> 30:20.408
For so long you've been burdened
with all the world's concerns.

30:21.144 --> 30:24.245
Once you're broken,
you'll have only one:

30:24.313 --> 30:27.115
pleasing me.

30:29.385 --> 30:30.652
Oh, Denna.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.454
Look at me.

30:32.522 --> 30:34.757
I'm skinny enough
as it is, hm?

30:34.825 --> 30:37.894
In a few days' time
I'll be a bag of bones,

30:37.961 --> 30:40.096
and a few days after that,
I'll be dead.

30:40.164 --> 30:41.765
How will I please you then?

30:41.832 --> 30:43.834
There's no pleasure
in breaking someone

30:43.902 --> 30:46.270
who's too weak to fight back.
Now eat!

30:46.338 --> 30:48.571
I've lost my appetite.

30:57.006 --> 31:00.873
Seeing as you're so eager
to begin your training,

31:00.941 --> 31:02.508
let's leave now.

31:02.576 --> 31:04.276
( screams )

31:09.846 --> 31:12.814
<i>( mysterious theme playing )</i>

31:16.685 --> 31:18.752
We have no choice.

31:18.820 --> 31:21.822
Without a Wizard of the First
Order to name a new Seeker,

31:21.889 --> 31:23.757
we have to find a way
into the Old World

31:23.825 --> 31:26.326
to get to Richard.
You need to rest.

31:26.394 --> 31:28.795
Stay here.
I'll find horses.

31:28.863 --> 31:30.196
I'm fine.

31:32.366 --> 31:33.800
I need to rest.

31:33.868 --> 31:35.268
I'm very tired.

31:37.404 --> 31:39.169
How can you be tired?

31:39.237 --> 31:41.136
It's not even mid-morning.

31:44.373 --> 31:47.408
<i>( mysterious theme playing )</i>

31:47.475 --> 31:49.109
(Cara)
What is it?

31:49.177 --> 31:50.377
That cloud.

31:50.445 --> 31:53.346
It's not moving
with the others.

31:53.413 --> 31:54.914
Why are we discussing
the weather?

31:54.981 --> 31:58.450
Because that's a tracer cloud.

31:58.518 --> 32:00.318
Sent by Zedd.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.687
The Wizard is dead.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.859
What if those corpses
were a trick?

32:07.927 --> 32:10.829
You're seeing
what you want to see.

32:10.897 --> 32:14.066
And you're not seeing
what's right in front of you.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.001
That's a message
sent by Zedd.

32:16.069 --> 32:19.003
I know you're grieving
for the Wizard,

32:19.071 --> 32:22.038
but you need to be strong enough
to accept the truth

32:22.106 --> 32:23.306
that he's dead.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.209
You're giving up
too easily.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.011
And you're relying
on blind faith.

32:30.079 --> 32:33.248
That's all we have left.

32:37.788 --> 32:39.756
Come on.

32:43.794 --> 32:45.928
( water trickling )

32:45.962 --> 32:47.930
(Verna)
The Lurra Caves.

32:47.998 --> 32:50.366
If your plan was to trap us,
you've succeeded brilliantly.

32:50.434 --> 32:51.701
The mud will show
their tracks.

32:51.769 --> 32:53.303
And if we know where they are,
we can kill them.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.837
They're already here.

32:54.905 --> 32:56.706
<i>( suspenseful theme playing )</i>

33:01.246 --> 33:03.047
Get behind me.

33:10.789 --> 33:14.091
If we're gonna die,

33:14.159 --> 33:16.027
let's die fighting.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.233

33:25.869 --> 33:27.403
Du' Challu!

33:38.381 --> 33:39.681
( Mriswith screeching )

33:47.990 --> 33:49.090
We killed it.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.133
So this is what
makes them invisible.

34:00.201 --> 34:02.436
The cloaks draw power
from the Wizard's blood

34:02.503 --> 34:03.970
that flows in their veins.

34:04.038 --> 34:05.472
( Verna gasps )

34:05.539 --> 34:07.507
(Richard)
What's wrong?

34:07.575 --> 34:09.175
(Verna)
The scar.

34:09.243 --> 34:11.944
Sister Katharine?

34:12.012 --> 34:13.344
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

34:13.413 --> 34:15.013

( gurgles )

34:26.126 --> 34:28.460

34:28.527 --> 34:30.928
Now we know how they've been
increasing their numbers.

34:30.996 --> 34:33.063
They're not killing people...

34:33.130 --> 34:35.331
They're turning them
into Mriswith.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.601
Maybe using their own
Wizard's blood.

34:37.668 --> 34:42.170
They must've taken Du' Challu
back to the lair.

34:42.239 --> 34:43.505
We may still have time
to save her.

34:43.572 --> 34:44.873
Their village isn't far.

34:44.940 --> 34:46.476
I thought you wanted
to get them back home.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.145
All of them.
Get the rest of these people

34:48.213 --> 34:50.685
back to their village.
I'm going in those caves.

34:50.753 --> 34:53.523
They'll kill you before
you get two steps inside.

34:53.590 --> 34:56.259
They can't kill me
if they can't see me.

34:58.363 --> 34:59.763
You said the cloaks draw
their power

34:59.831 --> 35:02.099
from Wizard's blood,
right?

35:02.167 --> 35:05.036
Then we'll see
if you're right about me.

35:09.644 --> 35:11.845
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

35:16.286 --> 35:18.020
(Denna)
Keep moving, Wizard.

35:18.088 --> 35:20.022
(Zedd)
Allow an old man to rest.

35:20.089 --> 35:22.424
Would you prefer
that I carry you?

35:22.491 --> 35:25.260
I'd prefer you
to rub my feet.

35:25.327 --> 35:27.629
It's no wonder
Cara's gone soft,

35:27.696 --> 35:30.365
with such weak companions
as you and your friends.

35:30.433 --> 35:32.400
What do you know
about friends?

35:32.468 --> 35:34.468
You have no one.

35:34.536 --> 35:37.370
That's the real reason
you won't kill me.

35:37.438 --> 35:38.903
Because then you'd be alone,

35:38.971 --> 35:41.538
which is what you fear most,
isn't it?

35:41.606 --> 35:43.606
My friends would
stop at nothing to find me.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.608
Who would do the same
for you?

35:45.676 --> 35:49.044
Friends are
for the helpless.

35:49.112 --> 35:50.445
Denna,

35:50.513 --> 35:54.147
I can think of no one who needs
help more than you.

35:54.215 --> 35:56.383
All your plans,
all your designs on power,

35:56.450 --> 35:57.750
where have they gotten you?

35:57.818 --> 36:01.420
They got me a Wizard
of the First Order.

36:01.488 --> 36:04.990
Who will soon be doing
everything I ask.

36:05.058 --> 36:07.560
And that will only draw
the attention of the Seeker,

36:07.628 --> 36:09.996
and your ruse will have been
for nothing.

36:10.064 --> 36:11.397
Everyone thinks you're dead.

36:11.465 --> 36:13.933
I gave you a second chance,
and this is how you use it?

36:14.001 --> 36:16.269
More vile schemes?

36:19.974 --> 36:22.241
You could be anyone now.

36:22.309 --> 36:23.876
A different person.

36:23.944 --> 36:25.010
A better person.

36:26.446 --> 36:27.512

36:29.548 --> 36:32.884
You think it's possible for me

Yes.

39:58.408 --> 40:01.309
So, what now?

40:01.377 --> 40:03.544
We have no choice.

40:03.612 --> 40:06.046
We have the compass back.

40:06.114 --> 40:09.282
But it only works
in the hands of the true Seeker.

40:09.350 --> 40:12.718
Kahlan, Richard gave you
the Sword of Truth

40:12.786 --> 40:14.219
so that I could name
a new Seeker

40:14.287 --> 40:16.088
while he is in the Old World.

40:16.155 --> 40:17.889
I trust his judgment.

40:25.930 --> 40:28.431
We can name a new Seeker.

40:35.238 --> 40:38.639
But we'll never find anyone
to replace Richard.

40:51.218 --> 40:53.085
Thank you for saving us.

40:53.153 --> 40:56.722
These people have given you back
the freedom you denied them.

40:56.789 --> 40:58.556
Go back to your town.

40:58.624 --> 40:59.857
How?

40:59.925 --> 41:02.359
There could still be Mriswith
out there.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.927
Richard has shown us
that they can be killed.

41:05.429 --> 41:08.465
Maybe if our people work
together, we can fight them.

41:16.573 --> 41:19.442
I prayed for someone
to come and protect us.

41:19.509 --> 41:22.512
And you did.

41:22.580 --> 41:24.814
So now I'll pray
for the Spirits

41:24.882 --> 41:26.349
to protect the Cahairn,

41:26.417 --> 41:29.887
or Wizard, or Seeker.

Whatever they call you.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.893

41:42.063 --> 41:43.995
It was very brave of you
to help these people.

41:45.197 --> 41:47.064
And very stupid.

41:47.132 --> 41:49.133
( chuckles )

41:49.201 --> 41:52.036
So how far to the Palace
of the Prophets?

41:52.104 --> 41:55.038
We'd be there already if you
hadn't insisted on this detour.

41:55.106 --> 41:57.674
Well, the sooner we get there,
the sooner I can get back home.

41:57.742 --> 42:02.011
You're not the only one
eager to return home.

42:02.079 --> 42:04.714
I haven't seen mine
in 24 years.

42:07.417 --> 42:08.884
How could you bear to be away

42:08.952 --> 42:10.519
from your loved ones
for so long?

42:10.587 --> 42:13.589
As long as you keep them
in your heart,

42:13.656 --> 42:14.823
