WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:09.176
You can't fire me.
I'm a part owner.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.178
No, I never once said that.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.805
Well, a lot of chicks think so, all right,
so keep it to yourself.

00:14.889 --> 00:18.601
I'm sorry, Rooster,
but this bar is the only thing I have.

00:18.685 --> 00:22.105
I can't risk losing it.
It's like my baby.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.690
I'm your literal baby.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.694
I mean, you really think
I'm that stupid I'm gonna lose it?

00:27.777 --> 00:28.778
No, it's not that.

00:28.861 --> 00:31.864
Although, you have lost
every cell phone you've ever had.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.118
And that sixth grade class iguana.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.287
Oh, and I found these in the door.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.706
-Those aren't mine.
-Oh?

00:39.789 --> 00:41.749
"If lost, please return to Rooster,

00:41.833 --> 00:44.252
the most badass motherfucker
in the universe."

00:45.337 --> 00:47.255
I mean, I'll throw it in lost and found.

00:48.881 --> 00:51.843
Look, I came here to help you, all right?
I'm not gonna let you down.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.761
Oh, sweetie, you're not letting me down.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.140
Would I have hired children
to dress up as leprechauns

00:57.224 --> 00:59.309
and serve beer on St. Patrick's Day?

00:59.392 --> 01:00.560
Eh, probably not.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.107
I love the fact that you did this for me,

01:05.190 --> 01:06.899
but it's calving season.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.111
You're really needed at the ranch.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.279
Well, what about you?

01:11.863 --> 01:14.074
The whole reason I took over
is so you could get out of here.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.868
Oh, I think it's a good time
for me to be back.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.246
I can help Colt and Abby with the wedding.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.664
And when it comes time for me
to get back on the road,

01:21.748 --> 01:23.708
I'll just find somebody to run this place.

01:23.791 --> 01:27.837
Until then, the only place you should be
pouring alcohol is into your mouth.

01:30.006 --> 01:33.009
[sighs] Damn.
No one knows you like your mom.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.597
[theme song playing]

02:38.866 --> 02:39.867
Wait, so Denver?

02:42.036 --> 02:44.164
What, are you gonna move?
How's that gonna work?

02:44.247 --> 02:47.709
[chuckles] I don't know. I'm just excited
someone might wanna hire me.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.712
[stutters] What happened to your pep talk?

02:50.795 --> 02:54.757
That's for jobs around here,
like in the Pizza Hut delivery zone.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.927
Colt, it's just an interview.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.054
Yeah, yeah, but what if you get it?

03:00.137 --> 03:01.556
I haven't thought that far ahead.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.974
I haven't even thought about
what I'm gonna wear.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.141
Shit, what am I gonna wear?

03:04.226 --> 03:06.185
All right, all right.
You know, just tell 'em you can't do it.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.231
And obviously,
your navy Michael Kors jacket

03:09.314 --> 03:10.898
and your dark Banana Republic jeans.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.817
Why would I tell 'em that I can't do it?

03:12.900 --> 03:15.612
And the Banana Republic jeans are
weekend casual, not business forward.

03:16.988 --> 03:20.742
Hey, we're getting married.
Like, we're starting our lives together.

03:20.825 --> 03:23.370
How are we gonna do that if you're working
six hours away from home?

03:23.453 --> 03:24.996
We don't know what's gonna happen.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.624
And, if it does happen,
we'll move there together.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.292
Oh! Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.710
I hope we get a first floor condo.

03:30.793 --> 03:33.045
That way I don't have to herd my cattle
into the elevator

03:33.129 --> 03:34.839
to take 'em out to graze in the lobby.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.800
So this is about your career?

03:37.884 --> 03:39.636
Didn't realize
it was more important than mine.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.804
I'm not saying that. I just...

03:41.888 --> 03:43.556
We agreed to start our lives here.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.228
Really? Because I bet if the Broncos
offered you a job as their quarterback,

03:48.311 --> 03:49.479
we'd be moving to Denver.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.731
That's football!
That's serving your country.

03:51.814 --> 03:52.690
[Abby scoffs]

03:53.441 --> 03:56.444
Colt, you didn't give a shit
about being here a year ago.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.446
I've been a teacher for ten years.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.197
It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do

04:00.282 --> 04:03.618
since I saw Ms. Frizzle take that
Magic School Bus inside the human ear.

04:04.952 --> 04:06.954
Why can't you just find a job around here?

04:07.038 --> 04:08.831
'Cause I don't know when that's gonna be.

04:08.915 --> 04:13.336
And I'd like to be able to afford things,
like food and health insurance.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.796
What happens if I get pregnant?

04:14.879 --> 04:17.590
What, we're gonna go out to the barn
and your dad's gonna deliver the baby?

04:17.674 --> 04:20.802
I mean, he's only lost
two calves in 30 years.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.805
I do not want you to do this.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.684
You're the one who told me
not to give up on teaching. I'm going.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.813
I say stupid shit all the time.
The one time you're gonna listen...

04:32.605 --> 04:36.651
Why didn't you listen when I said
we should teach Drake how to fetch a beer?

04:40.863 --> 04:42.449
So, what can I do for you, Maggie?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.159
Well, I've been doing some research
on the pipeline.

04:45.242 --> 04:46.411
Ah, fuck.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.205
Look at this map.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.250
Do you know that the pipeline runs
right under the Blue Mesa Reservoir?

04:53.335 --> 04:54.836
Yeah, they mentioned it.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.840
Remember we stopped at this bridge here,
to take some pictures?

04:58.923 --> 05:01.884
Instead, the boys just pissed
over the railing.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.012
"Look, Daddy,
now it's the Yellow Mesa Reservoir."

05:05.888 --> 05:09.642
Yeah. Next day we cashed in
their college funds and bought a VCR.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.729
The point is, with this pipeline,

05:12.812 --> 05:16.399
the best case scenario is a spill
that everybody hears about.

05:16.483 --> 05:20.277
But the worst case is some unseen leak
that we don't hear about

05:20.362 --> 05:22.697
till people start to grow a second head.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.367
That's twice as many people
talking to you, Beau.

05:26.158 --> 05:29.371
You don't think I've been struggling
with this ever since they approached me?

05:30.246 --> 05:34.626
This land's been in my family ever since
my father's father started this place.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.670
And yes, I wish Colt did have two heads.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.548
Then he can finally see
how fuckin' annoying he is.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.469
There are a ton of people
protesting this pipeline.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.554
I mean, I'm surprised
you're not one of 'em.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.516
You hate having people on your land.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.518
Remember when that census worker came?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.603
You met him at the door
with a gun and said,

05:53.686 --> 05:56.523
[imitating Beau] "You can leave
or the population can drop by one."

05:58.566 --> 06:00.902
I'm surprised
you're even considering this.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.906
Maggie, I don't have to
explain myself to you.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.198
This is my ranch.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.493
Look, it's just this. [sighs]

06:08.576 --> 06:11.746
In 30 years, there have been
over 9,000 pipeline spills,

06:11.829 --> 06:13.540
and that's just in the United States.

06:14.123 --> 06:18.085
I just know if something goes wrong,
you won't be able to live with yourself.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.505
I'll think about it, okay?

06:20.588 --> 06:21.881
Okay, thanks.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.675
Oh, another thing.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.343
I fired Rooster,
so he's coming back here to work.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.597
-Good. I'll be glad to have him.
-But?

06:30.181 --> 06:31.766
No buts. We could use the help.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.310
Are you fucking with me?

06:34.393 --> 06:36.938
No, I love my boys.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.898
And this conversation.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.858
Hope to see you again soon.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.110
You're fucking with me.

06:49.451 --> 06:52.203
-Morning, Mr. Bennett.
-Morning, Abby.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.706
You heading somewhere?

06:54.789 --> 06:56.958
Yeah. I'm, uh, going to Denver.

06:57.041 --> 07:01.170
Well, I'm not sure what Colt did,
but I can't say I'm surprised.

07:01.253 --> 07:02.672
And I hope we stay in touch.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.552
No, I'm going for an interview.
I'm staying overnight with a friend.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.346
Oh. So Colt didn't fuck anything up?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.975
-Mr. Bennett.
-Asked and answered.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.979
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:23.275 --> 07:24.819
-Colt?
-Hi.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.990
Gassed up your truck.
Checked your tire pressure.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.326
-You're good to go.
-Thanks.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.996
You didn't come to bed last night?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.165
No.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.418
Watched  SportsCenter  twice,
memorized the Top 10,

07:41.503 --> 07:43.170
then went over to Rooster's,

07:43.254 --> 07:44.881
pretended like I guessed 'em all.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.675
I passed out on his couch.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.845
When I woke up in the morning, somehow
he'd moved the couch out to the pasture.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.430
Guy's a fucking genius.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.521
There's a speed trap in Glenwood Springs.

07:59.604 --> 08:03.399
I know. Cop hides behind
the "Freeze the Fat" billboard.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.860
Just north of Vail,
there's a DUI checkpoint.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.154
It's not even 6:00 a.m.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.698
Yeah, just...
figured you might have a drink

08:10.782 --> 08:12.617
to calm your nerves before your interview.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.994
[chuckles] I'm not gonna drink.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.079
Okay.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.249
Guess you won't be needing this.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.880
Okay, well...

08:27.715 --> 08:29.050
Good luck, I guess.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.136
Thanks. I'll, uh, call you
when I get to Denver.

08:32.219 --> 08:33.220
Mmm-hmm.

08:36.473 --> 08:37.975
I mean, you did go to all the trouble.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.358
Drive safe.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.994
You wanna talk about it?

08:58.287 --> 09:00.497
-Nope.
-Good.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.084
You hear from your brother?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.128
Yeah. He said he's coming back.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.215
-You wanna talk about it?
-No.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.425
I wish we could
not talk like this every day.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.011
Let's get to work.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.056
-[vehicle approaching]
-Now who in the hell is this?

09:17.724 --> 09:21.102
Looks like Sam Peterson.
Brand new Silverado.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.938
Don't tell me he got that
at Elway's dealership.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.275
He did. It's right there
on the fucking plates. Fuck me.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.074
Hey, Sam. How are you?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.119
I got brain cancer.
How about you?

09:39.161 --> 09:42.206
-I got Colt.
-Oh, shit. Even worse.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.835
Man, old people are mean.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.881
What brings you by?

09:49.964 --> 09:52.634
Come by to let you know I'll be closing
the deal with Neumann's Hill

09:52.717 --> 09:53.635
at the end of the week.

09:54.301 --> 09:58.389
And I'm still willing to give you
a better deal than them,

09:58.472 --> 10:00.016
if you're interested.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.559
-I'd say we're definitely interested.
-We're not.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.478
-I mean, we can talk about it.
-We can't.

10:04.561 --> 10:06.731
-We'll get back to you.
-We won't.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.442
I appreciate you thinking about us, Sam.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.987
Well, if I am selling to Neumann's Hill,

10:13.070 --> 10:15.406
I got a lot of stuff
that you're welcome to.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.160
Lumber and feed,
a whole bunch of insulation.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.622
And it's the good kind, too,
before they banned asbestos.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.459
Asbestos? I'm not touching that shit.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.295
I'll send the boys over for it.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.802
There he is.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.805
[chuckles] Call me the McRib,
'cause I'm back, bitch!

10:38.888 --> 10:39.931
[Colt chuckles]

10:41.015 --> 10:43.893
-I'm glad you're back, man.
-Yeah, man. Me, too.

10:44.476 --> 10:47.313
Hey, so, uh,
did Abby take on that interview?

10:48.147 --> 10:51.067
Yeah, she left this morning. [sighs]

10:51.150 --> 10:52.652
What are you gonna do if she gets the job?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.111
Got no idea.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.489
That's why I gassed up her car
and put in a mix CD.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.575
All songs about missing home.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.994
"Back Where I Come From" by Kenny.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.746
"Home" by Dierks.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.916
Some song by Hank Jr.
called "OD'd in Denver."

11:06.999 --> 11:08.334
She'll get the message.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.630
Oh, hey, check out what I've come up with.
Get out.

11:14.548 --> 11:17.176
Hammer-darts. [laughs]

11:17.969 --> 11:19.971
-Holy shit!
-[laughing] Yeah.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.890
I have never loved being a rancher
more than I do right now.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.353
-Whoo!
-[Colt chuckling]

11:27.436 --> 11:29.355
Man, how did we not
come up with this sooner?

11:29.438 --> 11:32.108
Man, actually Dad invented it.
He threw a hammer at me and I ducked.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.111
[chuckles] Well, I'll tell you what.
I know what we're doing today.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.988
Yeah, I wish.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.866
I gotta go out and check to see
if any of 'em heifers are calving,

11:39.949 --> 11:42.576
and you gotta go muck the stalls.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.956
Yeah, that's a good one.
Uh, one small change.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.249
No fucking way.

11:49.666 --> 11:53.129
Look, I know it sucks, man,
but somebody's gotta shovel shit, so...

11:53.212 --> 11:54.964
Yeah, cool.
Well, let me know how that goes for you.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.301
Yeah. No. Uh...

12:00.011 --> 12:02.679
I've been running this ranch
with Dad for the last six months.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.724
Oh, that's great. I've been running
this ranch with Dad for about 15 years.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.852
Did you get hit in the head
with one of these hammer-darts?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.061
Two of 'em hit me.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.023
That don't change
the fact that I'm in charge.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.567
Right. You're in charge.
Uh, just one little change.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.403
Um... no fucking way.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.866
Hey, check it out. Why don't
we handle this like adults, all right?

12:21.949 --> 12:24.827
-One round of Hammer-darts.
-Oh. All right.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.538
Closest to the bulls-eye gets to pick.
Okay?

12:27.621 --> 12:28.915
Just so you know, I'm already a legend.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.167
They call me MC Hammer,
because you can't touch this.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.754
Boom! I'm like fuckin' Thor. [whoops]

12:35.838 --> 12:38.424
Just like the McRib, I'm gone.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.056
Here's some almond milk.

12:45.597 --> 12:47.892
Colt likes it, so I figured a lady would.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.685
[chuckles] Thank you.

12:50.311 --> 12:54.440
So, these contracts are ready to sign.
Do you have any last questions?

12:54.523 --> 12:55.983
Just one.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.319
Am I making a huge fucking mistake?

12:58.402 --> 13:01.613
[chuckling] Oh, definitely.
Sign right here.

13:03.490 --> 13:06.202
-What are you worried about?
-Is this pipeline safe?

13:07.536 --> 13:12.166
My ex-wife says there's been, like,
9,000 oil spills in the last 30 years.

13:12.249 --> 13:16.921
The fact is, the vast majority
of those 9,000 spills

13:17.004 --> 13:21.050
are smaller than the amount
of almond milk I'd put in my coffee.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.510
You know,
if I was as much of a girl as Colt.

13:25.721 --> 13:29.475
When did it become acceptable
for a man to wear lip balm?

13:30.309 --> 13:35.397
[chuckles] Look, pipelines are safer
than tankers to move fuel.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.526
They are constructed by engineers
who are obsessed with safety.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.653
Trucks are driven by people like...

13:42.738 --> 13:43.906
Well, your sons.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.412
If it's so safe,
why are people protesting this pipeline?

13:50.496 --> 13:53.624
There are people
who will protest everything, Beau.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.334
Even ranchers.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.170
There are people who think
it's wrong to eat animals.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.215
Yeah, well, tigers don't eat grass.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.469
Look, you don't have to decide today.

14:06.303 --> 14:09.056
Take some time. Make sure
you're comfortable with your decision.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.518
Okay. Thanks, Jen.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.271
And just so you know,

14:16.313 --> 14:19.566
I wouldn't be doing this
if I thought it was bad for the Earth.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.611
I was a huge activist in college.
You would've hated me.

14:22.694 --> 14:24.947
Oh, I don't think I would've hated you.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.782
I campaigned for Al Gore.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.659
I would've hated you.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.415
[chuckles] What's up, Jen?

14:34.999 --> 14:37.668
Oh! Hey, Rooster.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.421
This is getting awkward,
you stalking me like this.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.090
Did you get any of my texts?

14:44.341 --> 14:47.970
Yep. Yep, I've just been
really busy with work.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.972
Yeah, yeah. That's cool.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.975
Just didn't want you to think
I was blowing you off after our, uh...

14:53.935 --> 14:55.394
after-hours meeting.

14:56.853 --> 14:58.689
You know, sex.

14:59.856 --> 15:01.692
Look, Rooster,

15:01.775 --> 15:04.820
I hope this isn't too blunt, but...

15:04.904 --> 15:07.781
I regret what we did,
and I never wanna see you again.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.660
Well, trust me.

15:11.743 --> 15:14.788
There are plenty of ways we can do it
where you don't gotta see me at all.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.458
It was a bad night for me.

15:17.541 --> 15:21.212
I thought I was getting
some sort of revenge on my ex,

15:21.295 --> 15:23.714
but really, I was just punishing myself.

15:25.132 --> 15:29.095
Well, if you really wanna get back at him,
we should probably do it again.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.597
This time, take some pictures.

15:32.889 --> 15:34.100
Goodbye, Rooster.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.727
[chuckles] You didn't say no.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.895
Lose my number.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.148
Still not a no.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.734
You know, to sex.

15:49.823 --> 15:50.907
Hey.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.451
Sorry I'm late.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.954
I was just out doing
more work than Rooster.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.333
We need to make a final decision
on this pipeline.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.255
It involves all of us,
so we're gonna decide together.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.547
Oh, well, hang on a second.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.591
Is this, like, one of those times
where we're gonna vote,

16:07.674 --> 16:10.177
but our votes all count as one
and your vote counts as four?

16:11.220 --> 16:14.140
Yeah, 'cause when we was kids,
we all voted to go to Disneyland.

16:14.223 --> 16:18.685
But we ended up going to a reenactment
of the Battle of fucking Gettysburg.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.023
Do they let you shoot a cannon
at Disneyland?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.857
I don't know! I ain't never been!

16:28.820 --> 16:31.698
Look, we all know
what the ranch means to this family,

16:32.366 --> 16:33.825
and I wanna do right by it.

16:35.619 --> 16:39.706
Your mother has some valid concerns,
and we all have an equal voice here.

16:41.583 --> 16:45.129
That's something we learned
on our visit to Gettysburg.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.382
All I wanna say is,

16:48.465 --> 16:51.802
we can't just be concerned
with what happens here at the ranch.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.305
Pipelines fail.

16:54.388 --> 16:57.391
Yeah, but Mom, Engineer Jen said
there was, like, barely any risk.

16:57.474 --> 17:01.020
She works for the gas company.
Of course she'd say that.

17:01.103 --> 17:05.191
It's like Doug down at the bowling alley
saying he sprayed your shoes.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.692
He just wants his two bucks.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.153
He doesn't care whether
your feet itch for a week.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.865
I swear I saw that guy
huffing disinfectant in the alley one day.

17:14.991 --> 17:16.243
Sweet mullet, though.

17:17.661 --> 17:22.291
Look, if they don't build the pipeline,
the risk of a problem is zero.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.418
Yeah, Mom,
if they don't build this pipeline,

17:24.501 --> 17:26.420
the amount of money
we're gonna get is zero.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.881
-We can't base the decision just on money.
-[Rooster sighs]

17:29.965 --> 17:31.967
That isn't the way we raised you.

17:32.759 --> 17:37.556
We raised you to care about the community
and see how your choices affect others.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.184
And they're our neighbors, right?

17:40.267 --> 17:43.812
We go to church with them.
We drink with them.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.065
We ask them not to press charges

17:46.148 --> 17:48.817
when you get drunk
and run naked across their lawns.

17:50.694 --> 17:54.115
Mom, you know,
if we don't take that money,

17:54.198 --> 17:57.033
any one of them neighbors
you're talking about would.

17:57.118 --> 18:00.579
Well, then let it be
on their conscience, not yours.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.623
My conscience is fine!

18:03.415 --> 18:07.919
I mean, we break our backs here
every year.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.922
-We deserve that money.
-Exactly.

18:11.548 --> 18:15.051
Look, does Dad deserve
a brand new Sharper Image massage chair

18:15.136 --> 18:17.221
that I'd use when he's not around?

18:17.304 --> 18:18.472
Probably.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.017
But this money means
more to us than that, Mom.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.977
I mean, last year
we almost lost this place.

18:24.060 --> 18:26.647
Yeah, this money gives us a cushion
to make it through the lean years

18:26.730 --> 18:28.232
like we ain't never had before.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.067
I mean, it's breathing room. It's freedom.

18:31.152 --> 18:34.405
[stammering] And sure, maybe
two Sharper Image massage chairs

18:34.488 --> 18:35.531
sitting side-by-side.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.117
Would you listen to yourself, Colt?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.369
Don't you think
that sounds a little bit selfish?

18:40.452 --> 18:43.622
Look, if it's selfish for us
to want the Iron River Ranch

18:43.705 --> 18:46.917
to survive another three generations,
then fine. We're being selfish.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.503
Beau, what do you think?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.047
Look, if this was just up to you and me,

18:52.131 --> 18:55.342
we'd probably tell these people
where they could shove their pipeline.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.594
But the boys are the future.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.847
Jesus, that's scary.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.518
I'm sorry, Maggie.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.690
I appreciate you letting me state my case.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.320
I know you're disappointed,
but I hope you'll respect the decision.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.571
I do.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.241
But it's the same bullshit line you used
when you made us go to Gettysburg.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.204
[door opens and closes]

19:23.287 --> 19:27.833
Oh, all right.
I'll go talk to her. [sighs]

19:30.961 --> 19:32.045
Dad?

19:33.964 --> 19:36.383
Putting in that pipeline's
the right decision.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.134
I hope you're right.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.013
I will say that I liked hearing you
and Rooster talk about

19:42.097 --> 19:43.599
the future of this ranch.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.603
Would you say you're proud of us?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.438
I would not.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.897
[chuckling]

19:50.981 --> 19:52.358
I'm going to bed.

19:53.484 --> 19:57.028
Hey, hey, uh, as long...
as long as we're talking about the future,

19:57.112 --> 19:58.572
I got a question I gotta ask you.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.282
We're not going to fucking Disneyland.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.536
It's the happiest place on Earth, Dad.
They wouldn't let you in.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.829
[both chuckle]

20:05.912 --> 20:09.208
Look, uh, you know,
before Rooster came back,

20:09.291 --> 20:13.003
I was pretty clear about
what my responsibilities were around here.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.215
But now that he's back...

20:17.299 --> 20:18.967
like, who's your second-in-command?

20:19.050 --> 20:21.303
Same thing I've always said...

20:21.387 --> 20:22.263
The dog.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.517
I know.
He's also the one you'd save in a fire.

20:26.600 --> 20:31.272
But let's...
let's say you and Drake were away

20:31.355 --> 20:32.773
and there's an emergency on the ranch.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.859
And Rooster wants to handle it one way
and I want to handle it another.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.863
-Who decides?
-I'd say you figure it out,

20:39.946 --> 20:42.032
and then when you do the wrong thing,
I'll yell at you.

20:42.115 --> 20:45.327
Dad! Somebody has to be in charge.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.079
'Cause, otherwise when we disagree,
there ain't no way to settle it.

20:48.163 --> 20:52.584
Look, Colt, you've done a good job for me
the last six months.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.171
You're becoming
a better rancher every day.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.508
But Rooster worked for me for 15 years.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.093
And he's run his own ranch.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.558
Rooster's your number two?

21:08.600 --> 21:11.353
If you're gonna make me say it, yes.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.441
Wow.

21:18.109 --> 21:19.152
Okay.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.073
Thank you for telling me, sir.

21:31.039 --> 21:31.873
Hey.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.335
Hi.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.213
Wait. I thought you weren't
coming home till tomorrow.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.050
Yeah, well, that was before
I completely blew my interview.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.261
-It couldn't have been that bad.
-Oh, really?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.431
Well, I had a Red Bull
to get my energy up,

21:47.514 --> 21:50.476
and between the caffeine and my nerves,
I started sweating.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.353
So I stuffed a bunch of tissue
under my armpits

21:52.436 --> 21:54.605
and then forgot about it
until I shook the principal's hand.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.107
And then a huge wad of wet tissue
fell on the ground.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.693
I had to pretend it was a magic trick
and say, "Ta-da!"

21:59.776 --> 22:01.445
[chuckles]

22:02.321 --> 22:04.365
All right. That's pretty bad.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.408
No, that was when
the interview was still going well.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.577
When I went down to pick up the tissue,
I split my pants.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.578
Oh, no!

22:09.661 --> 22:12.498
When the interview was over,
I had to back out bowing like a geisha.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.457
[Colt chuckles]

22:14.290 --> 22:15.417
Aw.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.462
-Come here, baby.
-[chuckles]

22:18.545 --> 22:20.672
-[Colt] I'm sorry.
-[Abby] Mmm.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.424
Selfishly, I'm glad you're home.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.217
Mmm. Yeah, me, too.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.013
Plus, it was like every song I listened to
was telling me to come home.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.641
That's weird.

22:33.935 --> 22:37.523
-Beer?
-Sure. [chuckles]

22:37.606 --> 22:40.651
-So, how was your day?
-[groans]

22:41.735 --> 22:45.113
Dad decided
to finally put in that pipeline.

22:45.196 --> 22:47.908
-That's good.
-Yeah, sure.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.620
All right, what's wrong? I know you.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.122
If everything was good, you wouldn't be
up here drinking helmet beers.

22:54.205 --> 22:56.166
You'd be downstairs drinking fridge beers.

22:58.334 --> 22:59.795
My mom fired Rooster,

23:00.754 --> 23:02.047
so he's back working here.

23:04.215 --> 23:05.967
And after one day...

23:07.844 --> 23:09.763
my dad made him his number two.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.974
I'm sure you're just reading into things.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.976
Abby, you know I don't read.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.147
He literally said, "Rooster's number two."

23:19.230 --> 23:20.398
[chuckles]

23:20.482 --> 23:21.608
It's just...

23:25.028 --> 23:26.905
I always had this dream, you know, like...

23:27.698 --> 23:29.866
someday, I'd be like my dad.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.827
You know, the ultimate provider.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.913
I'd have this ranch, I'd be able
to take care of you and our kids.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.250
It's... That ain't gonna happen here.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.337
This place is Rooster's.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.090
So we'll kill him, no big deal.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.842
[both chuckle]

23:46.925 --> 23:49.135
You know your dad is gonna leave it
to both of you.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.806
Okay. All right, so then what?
Best case scenario, we share it?

23:52.889 --> 23:55.601
Ab, this place barely provides
for one family.

23:55.684 --> 23:59.062
How are we gonna support
you and me and our kids,

23:59.145 --> 24:00.481
and Rooster and his kids,

24:00.564 --> 24:03.900
and some step-kids his first wife
left behind when she went to jail?

24:05.401 --> 24:07.362
Don't worry, we'll get through it
with love in our hearts

24:07.445 --> 24:09.280
and beer in our helmet.

24:09.364 --> 24:12.576
No... that ain't gonna be enough.

24:13.284 --> 24:15.328
You deserve way more than that.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.039
And I'm gonna get it for you.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.959
I know you will. I love you.

24:23.504 --> 24:26.172
I'm gonna get ready for bed. Uh...

24:27.090 --> 24:28.967
-[giggles]
-[snorts]

24:29.760 --> 24:31.011
Oh, you know what? Shower beer.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.980
Mr. Peterson? You out here?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.400
Hey.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.611
Colt.

24:50.030 --> 24:53.825
What are you, uh... what are you smoking
in there? Venison? Rabbits?

24:53.909 --> 24:54.951
Pot.

24:56.202 --> 24:58.539
Okay, yeah, for the cancer?

24:58.622 --> 24:59.665
Sure.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.001
Why are you here?

25:04.127 --> 25:06.630
Uh, well, I was...

25:07.589 --> 25:09.007
Do I still have time?

25:09.090 --> 25:11.092
Or you already made that deal
with Neumann's Hill?

25:11.176 --> 25:13.595
[grunts] No, not until Friday afternoon.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.599
But I'll sell it to you right now
for a pizza.

25:18.725 --> 25:22.062
Mr. Peterson, I wanna buy your ranch.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.897
What about your dad?

25:23.980 --> 25:26.817
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he doesn't have a pizza either.

25:28.526 --> 25:31.822
I wanna work on this.
I'll go down to the bank and get a loan.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.074
I just... I need to know I still got time.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.200
Colt...

25:36.409 --> 25:40.163
you know I'd rather sell it to you
than some corporation.

25:40.914 --> 25:44.250
Well, you know this land.
You love it. You respect it.

25:45.627 --> 25:49.756
You tell me what you need,
and I'll help you make it happen.

25:51.174 --> 25:54.094
Okay. You're already giving us
a pretty good deal,

25:54.177 --> 25:55.679
but maybe you take
a little more off the price?

25:55.762 --> 25:56.972
Not a chance.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.810
Okay. Give us a little more time
to come up with the money?

26:01.893 --> 26:02.936
No fucking way.

26:05.188 --> 26:08.191
Okay, so... same price, Friday afternoon?

26:08.274 --> 26:10.944
Like I said, anything I can do.

26:15.115 --> 26:18.994
So, I'm thinking, "What is
this sweet little elderly woman doing

26:19.077 --> 26:21.705
on her ninth plate
of all-you-can-eat pancakes?"

26:22.623 --> 26:24.207
And I look at her purse

26:24.290 --> 26:27.335
and that blue-haired bitch
brought Tupperware.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.212
-Smart.
-[Joanne chuckles]

26:29.796 --> 26:33.258
I wonder how many chicken-fried steaks
I could get in my hat?

26:33.341 --> 26:34.342
[chuckles]

26:36.011 --> 26:39.180
Oh-ho-ho! The ol' Four Roses, huh?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.766
[clicks tongue]
I've been looking for that.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.936
This kid couldn't find Waldo
in five different books.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.272
[chuckles] Rooster?

26:47.355 --> 26:49.858
Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

26:52.653 --> 26:56.823
-Oh-ho-ho! The good stuff.
-Ah, yeah.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.368
Let me get that.
I'll take three fingers of that.

27:00.451 --> 27:01.828
I'll give you one.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.167
I don't know if you boys are interested,
but this is a really good bottle.

27:07.250 --> 27:11.963
If you smell it first, you'll notice
notes of oak and maple and caramel...

27:12.047 --> 27:13.339
[both grunt and sigh]

27:13.423 --> 27:15.008
Oh! You're already done.

27:16.259 --> 27:19.846
-[belches] Ooh, there's the maple.
-[Rooster grunts]

27:20.555 --> 27:22.015
[cell phone rings]

27:23.474 --> 27:24.642
Hey, Mom.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.105
What? You okay?

27:30.606 --> 27:33.151
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

27:34.277 --> 27:36.947
-What's up?
-Dude, Mom's in jail.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.031
-[Beau] What?
-[Joanne] Oh, my God.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.201
-Ah, crap.
-What'd she get arrested for?

27:41.868 --> 27:43.328
Protesting the pipeline.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.666
[country music playing]
