WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:04.189
Anyone watching thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all

00:04.190 --> 00:07.317
about owt,
needs to watch their back...

00:07.483 --> 00:10.437
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:10.603 --> 00:12.197
sending prices sky-high,

00:12.363 --> 00:16.189
literally... literally, taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:16.923 --> 00:18.917
And now you've
got your ConDemNation.

00:19.083 --> 00:22.677
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:22.843 --> 00:25.717
Have we had a national
fucking stroke... or what?!

00:26.323 --> 00:27.797
Is revolution a word...

00:28.323 --> 00:30.029
or was it never?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.557
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:32.723 --> 00:35.997
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.163 --> 00:38.837
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:39.483 --> 00:42.077
and they charge us for water!

00:42.243 --> 00:45.597
I wondered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:47.603 --> 00:50.597
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:50.763 --> 00:53.189
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:53.190 --> 00:56.477
It's not theirs anymore.

00:56.643 --> 00:58.949
This is our England now!

00:58.950 --> 01:01.829
P-a-a-a-rty!

01:01.830 --> 01:03.829
This programe contains very strong
language from the outset.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.149
Or disturbing.

01:06.150 --> 01:10.149
It starts when you're young,
deceit.

01:15.043 --> 01:18.117
Tooth fairies, Santa Claus, God.

01:18.283 --> 01:21.989
Eventually, you wise up
and realise you've been had.

01:21.990 --> 01:25.837
Convenient un-truths,
half-truths, lies.

01:28.003 --> 01:30.829
It's just... how things work.

01:30.830 --> 01:33.109
Oh, aye, get your tits out,
you little slag!

01:33.110 --> 01:36.549
Good shag last night, was it? Where
you off now? Flicking your bean?

01:36.550 --> 01:38.309
Hey, love, come and suck my dick.

01:38.310 --> 01:39.414
How much for a blowey, Blondie?

01:39.415 --> 01:43.229
Hey, you're going wrong way, I'm
here! I'll fucking rip you in half!

01:43.470 --> 01:45.629
So, you learn to do it
to other people.

01:45.630 --> 01:48.149
Touch of flattery here,
little white lie there,

01:48.150 --> 01:51.029
Spare someone's feelings,
keep the peace.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.389
Before you know it,
it's second nature...

01:53.390 --> 01:57.197
Deceiving yourself
as well as everybody else. No harm.

01:57.363 --> 02:00.469
It oils the wheels,
keeps the world turning.

02:00.470 --> 02:03.309
The truth is hard enough
to swallow as it is.

02:03.310 --> 02:05.557
Why would I want
to own up to reality

02:05.723 --> 02:08.908
every time I look in
the fucking mirror?

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.603 --> 02:37.077
No, no. I don't think so.

02:37.243 --> 02:41.069
Starving children, fair enough,
but, er, winter coats for donkeys,

02:41.310 --> 02:42.677
nah, not a chance.

02:42.843 --> 02:45.669
It's not winter coats.
It's body-warmers,

02:45.670 --> 02:49.149
to stop them freezing to death
half-way up mountains in...

02:49.150 --> 02:51.349
Azer, azer...?

02:51.350 --> 02:52.909
Azerbaijan.

02:52.910 --> 02:55.829
And do these donkeys
prefer Velcro fasteners,

02:55.830 --> 02:57.237
or the ones with zips up the front?

02:57.403 --> 03:01.229
Scabby Queen!

03:01.350 --> 03:02.442
Right, I'm going to the gym.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.189
Thought you did 10k this morning?

03:04.190 --> 03:07.509
I did, but no point in gambling
wi' a marked deck.

03:07.510 --> 03:09.557
- Kiss my arse.
- I'll kiss your arse.

03:09.723 --> 03:13.549
OK, treble the stakes, and we can
consider my arse on the table.

03:14.323 --> 03:16.037
That was you not
so long ago, wasn't it?

03:16.203 --> 03:18.237
Lads tripping up over themselves
just to get near?

03:18.403 --> 03:20.437
Er, I'm not out to pasture just yet.

03:20.603 --> 03:22.546
Oh, I don't doubt it.

03:22.547 --> 03:24.717
I mean, you're the reason why half
the men walk in through that door.

03:24.883 --> 03:26.237
Hoping you'll glance

03:26.403 --> 03:28.709
in their direction at least once
or twice throughout the day.

03:31.950 --> 03:35.309
Cheap beer might have
something to do with it.

03:35.310 --> 03:36.397
She'll succumb.

03:36.563 --> 03:37.957
Succumb to what?

03:38.123 --> 03:40.989
Well, at their core, what women want
is to be rescued, y'know.

03:40.990 --> 03:44.709
To be swept off their feet
by a knight in shining armour.

03:44.710 --> 03:48.709
Why, who needs rescuing around here?
She doesn't.

03:49.070 --> 03:50.397
I don't.

03:50.563 --> 03:54.389
She doesn't realise it yet.
And you...

03:59.363 --> 04:03.189
I think you're bored, Karen.

04:14.430 --> 04:16.517
Still spilling out
pearls of wisdom, is he?

04:16.683 --> 04:19.557
What is it this time? Middle East?
Dangers of globalisation?

04:19.723 --> 04:23.357
He's usually got a point,
you know. He's a clever fella.

04:29.150 --> 04:33.029
I say!

04:33.030 --> 04:35.317
Feeding your filthy
habit on Trust property.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.669
Proper written warning, there.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.669
- You sound like my daughter.
- You've got a daughter?

04:39.670 --> 04:41.669
Behave. You're nearly an hour late.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.309
They won't notice.

04:43.310 --> 04:45.917
Old McGuinness has been dead
at his bench two months,

04:46.083 --> 04:47.189
no-one's clocked it.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.517
Have you been drinking?

04:48.683 --> 04:52.509
Haven't been home yet,
still buzzing!

04:53.550 --> 04:57.437
Any time you want to come along,
Brown Sugar... just let me know.

04:58.550 --> 04:59.837
That's racist, you know.

05:00.003 --> 05:03.829
Only in a post-modern way,
though. Doesn't count.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.429
You're wrong.

05:12.430 --> 05:15.077
More often than I'd like to admit.
But not about you.

05:15.243 --> 05:19.269
I've got a good life.
Beautiful son, loyal husband, pub.

05:22.963 --> 05:25.469
You're not built to be sedate.
You dream of better.

05:25.470 --> 05:27.909
It oozes out of every pore.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.509
Everybody dreams.

05:30.510 --> 05:31.877
Even you.

05:32.043 --> 05:35.869
I couldn't tell you the things
that go on in my dreams.

05:35.870 --> 05:39.957
Y'know, most women lead
lives of quiet desperation,

05:40.123 --> 05:42.429
and go to their graves with
the song still in them.

05:42.430 --> 05:43.549
Is that you, Karen?

05:43.550 --> 05:45.309
Quoting poets doesn't do it for me.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.357
Just passing somebody else's
words off as your own.

05:47.523 --> 05:48.957
Fair enough. If not poets,

05:49.123 --> 05:50.349
what does do it for you?

05:50.350 --> 05:53.149
My husband.

05:53.150 --> 05:57.149
Then why are you in here
with the Black Knight?

05:57.350 --> 06:01.349
Cos I brought the towels in.

06:02.243 --> 06:06.069
Y'know, it's not me you need
to convince, love. It's her.

06:15.603 --> 06:19.429
Oi, you, share the wealth!

06:25.763 --> 06:28.669
Shall I tell you what I can see?

06:28.670 --> 06:29.717
I'm intrigued.

06:29.883 --> 06:33.197
A scared man, who'll shag anything
just to stave off the loneliness.

06:33.363 --> 06:36.237
I can't work out whether there's
more to you than meets the eye,

06:36.403 --> 06:38.709
or less.

06:38.710 --> 06:41.869
Y'know, I don't fuck women
because I'm lonely, Karen.

06:41.870 --> 06:45.469
I fuck women because I'm good at it.

06:45.470 --> 06:49.557
I've gotta go.

06:49.723 --> 06:53.549
Karen?

06:58.209 --> 07:02.208
What the fuck is going on?

07:02.483 --> 07:04.237
We're all here cos you need help,
Kel.

07:04.403 --> 07:05.437
You need straightening out, love.

07:05.603 --> 07:06.968
A few parties. So what?

07:06.969 --> 07:09.557
Looked in the mirror lately?
Not a pretty sight.

07:09.723 --> 07:13.608
Pot, kettle, black, Zippy.

07:14.089 --> 07:15.197
Any more for any more?

07:15.363 --> 07:18.128
I'm a priest. I just get
dragged along to these things.

07:18.129 --> 07:20.008
Well, if I could make
an observation.

07:20.009 --> 07:24.008
You, handing out life-lessons?
Really?

07:24.249 --> 07:27.397
It's now, Kelly.
That's the way it works.

07:31.923 --> 07:35.728
- The drink is taking its toll.
- And the drugs.

07:35.729 --> 07:38.997
And you know you have to be careful
where the drugs are concerned.

07:39.163 --> 07:42.408
I'm worried and that's why I've got
everyone here, cos we love you.

07:42.409 --> 07:43.437
You look a mess.

07:43.603 --> 07:45.677
Yeah, we all love ya.

07:45.843 --> 07:48.197
And I never had to pay
anyone nothing.

07:48.363 --> 07:51.237
Everyone's your friend
and we want you to get better.

07:51.403 --> 07:54.517
Why don't you cook her a nice
spaghetti bolognaise or summat?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.917
- I can't cook.
- What is it?!

07:57.083 --> 08:00.117
Her breasts
have all but disappeared.

08:00.283 --> 08:01.237
Considering what you came from...

08:01.403 --> 08:03.077
- Shut it now!
- Fuck off, you!

08:03.243 --> 08:07.128
See what you're causing?
All this mayhem, everyone arguing...

08:07.763 --> 08:09.437
- Think it's going all right, innit?!
- No-one's judging you...

08:09.603 --> 08:11.397
Actually, I am judging you.

08:11.563 --> 08:13.717
You just sit there, like that!

08:13.883 --> 08:17.077
Live fast, die young,
leave behind a beautiful corpse.

08:17.243 --> 08:21.128
Or, in your case, just a corpse.

08:25.369 --> 08:28.248
This is what you all think?

08:35.409 --> 08:37.599
Apart from us...

08:40.082 --> 08:43.967
Excuse me.

08:45.009 --> 08:49.008
Kelly!

08:54.043 --> 08:57.888
Well, that went well.

09:07.123 --> 09:09.088
Still think she needs rescuing?

09:09.089 --> 09:10.568
Oh, I know it.

09:10.569 --> 09:13.848
Running in the street, parting
horny boys from pennies at cards,

09:13.849 --> 09:16.368
doesn't qualify
as emancipation in my book.

09:16.369 --> 09:17.728
You're so full of it.

09:17.729 --> 09:20.728
Y'know, I reckon
I could have that girl

09:20.729 --> 09:22.928
flat on her back any time I like.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.928
15 years ago, maybe.
You keep taking your pills, studly.

09:27.449 --> 09:30.848
Care to make a wager on that?

09:31.123 --> 09:32.328
On you shagging Ruby?

09:32.329 --> 09:36.328
Yeah, I mean, if I haven't shagged
Ruby in the next 48 hours,

09:36.609 --> 09:39.568
I'll put 50 quid in that donkey
tin of yours, how's that?

09:39.569 --> 09:41.277
I'll take action on that.

09:41.443 --> 09:43.848
But if I do win -
I don't get your money.

09:43.849 --> 09:46.128
Oh?

09:46.129 --> 09:49.088
If I win...

09:49.089 --> 09:52.928
I get to fuck you.

09:53.443 --> 09:56.928
Nah.

09:56.929 --> 10:00.928
Didn't think so.

10:25.969 --> 10:27.368
Where are you going?

10:27.369 --> 10:28.597
I'm leaving.

10:28.763 --> 10:32.648
You arrogant,
judgemental fucking cunts.

10:35.323 --> 10:39.128
Kelly, Kelly...

10:39.129 --> 10:40.717
One-nil to the Libertines.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.688
It's just running away.

10:42.689 --> 10:45.928
You think I've been wild till now,
lover? Watch this fucking space!

10:45.929 --> 10:47.168
But... where...?

10:47.169 --> 10:48.608
London.

10:48.609 --> 10:51.648
Ibiza fucking loved me there,
best years of my life.

10:51.649 --> 10:54.568
Dublin, maybe. They appreciate
a bit of wild over there.

10:54.569 --> 10:56.008
No fucking millstones round my neck.

10:56.009 --> 10:58.328
What about your stuff, your clothes?

10:58.584 --> 11:00.503
Burn them, have a fucking wank
over them, I don't give a shit.

11:00.504 --> 11:01.237
Please!

11:01.544 --> 11:05.543
Don't you fucking dare!
I've been that soldier before.

11:06.064 --> 11:08.463
I love you.

11:08.464 --> 11:10.637
I don't love you.

11:15.724 --> 11:19.637
- Oh, Manchester is wonderful!
- Kelly!

Mrs Robinson?

12:13.363 --> 12:15.197
I think you've made a mistake.

12:15.363 --> 12:18.877
ICU morphine pills -
ward 45, bed seven.

12:19.043 --> 12:22.952
What about them?

12:23.153 --> 12:25.272
You used 100 milligrams.

12:25.273 --> 12:27.952
And?

12:27.953 --> 12:31.517
We sent up 15s only yesterday.
The patient's four days post-op.

12:31.683 --> 12:34.677
It doesn't make sense for
the dosage to change like that.

12:34.843 --> 12:36.117
Can I ask you a question?

12:36.283 --> 12:39.517
Who are you trying to prove
yourself to? There's only me here.

12:39.683 --> 12:41.877
I'm not, I just didn't...

12:42.043 --> 12:45.952
Just a minute. Right, so you're
Trainee Pharmacist's Assistant.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.557
Is that right? That's your title?

12:49.723 --> 12:51.277
You haven't been home.

12:51.443 --> 12:54.637
I'm just checking, in case
you thought you were a pharmacist.

12:54.803 --> 12:58.712
Cos you're not and I am.

12:59.393 --> 13:03.157
I did the studying and the work
and you know, all that stuff.

13:06.803 --> 13:10.712
Grow up.

13:14.473 --> 13:18.512
(WOMAN) Where have you been, Marie?

13:18.513 --> 13:22.552
Oh, fucking excellent.

13:22.553 --> 13:25.517
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

13:25.683 --> 13:28.037
Well, now you've found me,
you can shuffle off.

13:28.203 --> 13:30.677
I've been looking for you, Marie.

13:30.843 --> 13:35.712
Nope.
SIREN WAILS

13:38.603 --> 13:39.797
You can fuck off.

13:39.963 --> 13:43.872
Charming.

13:44.363 --> 13:48.272
Go on, then.

13:50.123 --> 13:53.637
So, do you know your name?
Or are you too addled?

13:53.803 --> 13:56.752
Annie.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.597
What you dressed like that for?

13:59.763 --> 14:02.477
You look like a Ladyboy
or a big blonde goat.

14:02.643 --> 14:04.432
(LAUGHS)

14:04.433 --> 14:06.117
With no social filter.

14:06.283 --> 14:07.952
Just gets better.

14:07.953 --> 14:11.872
You won't take me back, will you?

14:11.873 --> 14:13.197
Are you sure?

14:13.363 --> 14:14.712
Positive.

14:14.713 --> 14:18.072
It's not a bit mutton dressed
as lamb? I am over 30, you know.

14:18.073 --> 14:21.712
It'll keep you out of the clutches
of Age Concern - night on the tiles.

14:21.713 --> 14:24.032
Are you sure?
Cos I haven't seen you in...

14:24.033 --> 14:26.592
Ever. But fuck it, live dangerous.

14:26.593 --> 14:29.677
You don't want to go through life
with regrets, Annie, do you?

14:29.843 --> 14:31.992
W-e-e-e-e-e!

14:31.993 --> 14:35.677
Look at you. You don't know whether
it's Christmas or Tuesday, do you?

14:35.843 --> 14:36.992
No.

14:36.993 --> 14:39.272
That's why you have
to embrace life, isn't it?

14:39.273 --> 14:41.712
So, what do you fancy, then?
Local or into town?

14:41.713 --> 14:44.552
- What for?
- Couple of drinks, bit of dancing.

14:44.553 --> 14:46.392
Oh, no, I can't go with you.
I'm going to a party.

14:46.393 --> 14:48.872
What? Fuck off. What party?

14:48.873 --> 14:51.152
My daughter - it's her birthday.

14:51.153 --> 14:52.672
Then, I'll come with.

14:52.673 --> 14:56.192
No, you look strange
and I've only just met you.

14:56.193 --> 14:59.352
What are you going on about?
It's me - Marie.

14:59.843 --> 15:02.272
Don't be ridiculous -
Marie died 20 years ago.

15:02.273 --> 15:05.837
Now, please leave me alone.

15:07.633 --> 15:11.632
Fuck me. Blown out by a mentalist.

15:15.433 --> 15:17.552
(CALUM) Avril, wait!

15:17.553 --> 15:21.552
Come on, wait. I'm sorry.

15:22.273 --> 15:25.317
You were right.
Iwasusing 100 milligrams.

15:25.923 --> 15:28.592
I could have done some real damage.

15:28.593 --> 15:32.592
I'm sorry. I knew you were right
and I panicked.

15:33.353 --> 15:37.352
Nasty tongue on you when you're
under pressure. What are you on?

15:38.753 --> 15:42.557
Er, it's hydrocodone.
It's kind of like Vicodin.

15:42.723 --> 15:44.272
But it's not addictive.

15:44.273 --> 15:45.557
Vicodin's addictive.

15:45.723 --> 15:48.992
It won't happen again, I promise.

15:48.993 --> 15:52.957
Tomorrow's another day, eh?

15:53.123 --> 15:56.472
You saved someone's life today,
you know. No, I mean it.

15:56.473 --> 16:00.197
If that prescription had gone up to
ward 45, bed seven would be toast.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.152
It's not natural, you know?

16:13.153 --> 16:14.317
Ground rules.

16:14.483 --> 16:17.432
Ruby can't know it's a bet,
at any time.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.237
In fact, nobody knows about it.

16:19.403 --> 16:20.672
Agreed.

16:20.673 --> 16:23.637
No third party involvement,
assistance or interference.

16:23.803 --> 16:25.637
It won't be necessary.

16:25.803 --> 16:29.637
No bribes, inducements
or misdirection of any kind.

16:29.803 --> 16:32.752
One hangover from my past life
is I never lie.

16:32.753 --> 16:36.237
Well, not for personal gain,
any road. I'll play a straight game.

16:36.403 --> 16:40.312
There's going to be some
toasty donkeys in Azerbaijan.

16:42.883 --> 16:43.832
Hiya.

16:43.833 --> 16:47.832
Hey.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.717
Whatever the outcome,

16:51.883 --> 16:55.792
this is a once-only gig
and it happens on my terms.

16:57.353 --> 16:59.077
I'm entirely at your disposal.

16:59.243 --> 17:03.152
Good.

17:08.673 --> 17:09.916
Take it easy!

17:10.083 --> 17:11.752
You know what
this stuff does to you.

17:11.752 --> 17:15.791
You have no idea of the buzz.

17:15.792 --> 17:19.832
Someone could literally
be dead right now

17:19.833 --> 17:21.992
if I hadn't done what I did.

17:21.992 --> 17:23.152
Hard to take in.

17:23.153 --> 17:26.236
I wasn't going to do it.
I wasn't going to say anything.

17:26.402 --> 17:29.192
Could've landed myself in
big trouble, but I thought,

17:29.193 --> 17:32.072
"No, Avril, it's your duty.

17:32.073 --> 17:36.157
"Someone's mother,
father or lover..."

17:36.323 --> 17:38.557
How do you know you didn't
rescue an arsehole?

17:38.723 --> 17:41.872
Maybe it was a wife-beater
or a child molester you saved.

17:41.873 --> 17:44.277
Could've done more harm than good.

17:44.443 --> 17:47.837
Life's cheap. Hospital deaths are
ten a penny. Hardly worth a mention.

17:48.003 --> 17:49.637
Lying, fucking whore. Fuck.

17:49.803 --> 17:53.077
Have you got a smart-arsed comment
to add, have you?

17:53.243 --> 17:54.792
No, Avril, don't.

17:54.793 --> 17:56.277
Model citizen, are you?
Avril!

17:56.923 --> 17:59.917
No! I did a good thing!

18:00.083 --> 18:01.877
I won't be ridiculed or...

18:02.043 --> 18:04.077
Avril, the prostitute
dumped him today.

18:04.243 --> 18:05.512
Marty!

18:05.513 --> 18:09.117
Left him in the street
crying like a big fecking baby.

18:09.283 --> 18:10.837
It was very upsetting for everyone.

18:11.003 --> 18:12.917
It's yin and yang.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.637
Save a life with one hand,

18:14.803 --> 18:17.557
crush a poor, desperate soul
with the other.

18:17.723 --> 18:21.632
Karma.

18:35.913 --> 18:39.912
(TV) It doesn't take long,
with patience and care,

18:40.633 --> 18:43.637
to make a pocket with a face.

18:43.963 --> 18:47.872
Hello.

19:02.473 --> 19:04.157
"Get off my stool".

19:04.323 --> 19:08.232
Frank, please. I don't do amphibians,
all right? They give me the creeps.

19:08.513 --> 19:10.037
"You're on my stool - get off".

19:10.203 --> 19:14.157
It's not an amphibian.
He's a reptile.

19:14.323 --> 19:18.232
Look, that seat is
my only long-term investment.

19:19.643 --> 19:22.717
Diversify, Francis. You know,
I couldn't vacate this stool

19:22.883 --> 19:25.877
now you've asked me, even if
I wanted to, on masculine principle.

19:26.043 --> 19:28.917
You didn't have masculine principles
when you were porking altar boys.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.357
I've never porked an altar boy.

19:31.523 --> 19:35.432
That's clearly a fantasy
of yours, not mine.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.992
(FARTS)

19:44.083 --> 19:46.432
Have it. Be my guest.

19:46.433 --> 19:49.397
You know it makes sense.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.917
Appreciate this.
Be a couple of hours, yeah?

19:52.083 --> 19:53.557
- All goes in the holiday fund.
- Here she is! Little Miss...

19:53.723 --> 19:55.957
Shut it, you piss-soaked tramp.

19:56.123 --> 19:59.797
If I want your opinion,
you'll be the first to know.

19:59.963 --> 20:02.397
It was going to be a compliment.

20:02.563 --> 20:06.472
Karen, a pint
and two vowels, please.

20:12.763 --> 20:14.632
You on late shifts all week?

20:14.633 --> 20:18.632
More's the pity.

20:20.233 --> 20:23.232
I'm so sorry.

20:23.233 --> 20:25.672
- I thought you were having a go.
- Don't matter.

20:25.673 --> 20:27.157
What's going on?

20:27.323 --> 20:28.912
He won't open till two.

20:28.913 --> 20:30.912
Carpetbagger!

20:30.913 --> 20:34.197
Look, the licensing people
are all over it, man.

20:34.363 --> 20:37.792
Strict operating hours. So the
junkies don't flog the kids gear

20:37.793 --> 20:39.312
in the middle of the night.

20:39.313 --> 20:42.477
What are you selling?

20:42.643 --> 20:46.552
She's fucked off
on a new life. Slut!

20:47.153 --> 20:49.512
The girl's in trouble.

20:49.513 --> 20:51.997
She'll be coming back -
she loves you.

20:52.163 --> 20:55.917
I won't fucking sell it, then!
Gay! Taliban!

20:56.083 --> 20:59.477
Shit tan. Gaylord. Fuck them.

21:01.833 --> 21:04.872
How you getting on?

21:04.873 --> 21:07.352
Bit stuck?

21:07.353 --> 21:10.277
No.

21:10.443 --> 21:14.352
I've not finished with that yet.

21:22.363 --> 21:25.352
What a dick. He always that rude?

21:25.353 --> 21:29.352
Pretty much.

21:38.753 --> 21:40.237
Avril!

21:40.403 --> 21:43.077
Check me out! Got in early, showered.

21:43.243 --> 21:47.152
Even put on deodorant
or air freshener. Not sure.

21:48.003 --> 21:51.597
You know, if you ever did
want to seduce me, Mrs Robinson,

21:51.763 --> 21:55.672
I'd be all right with it.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.552
Meteor.

22:02.553 --> 22:03.757
I'm sorry?

22:03.923 --> 22:07.317
Unusually remote celestial body.
Seven down. Anagram of remote.

22:12.163 --> 22:13.597
Subtlety's not
your strong point, is it?

22:13.763 --> 22:15.712
Don't flatter yourself.

22:15.713 --> 22:18.477
I'm just wondering - why the mask?
You're not an idiot.

22:18.643 --> 22:21.477
So, what's with the heels,
tits and teeth?

22:21.643 --> 22:23.072
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

22:23.073 --> 22:24.757
Precisely my question.

22:24.923 --> 22:27.517
There's more to you than
these mugs get to see, right?

22:27.683 --> 22:31.592
If you know so much about it,
you tell me.

22:32.243 --> 22:33.952
So, I had my palm read today.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.677
I've told Karen about
letting them in the pub.

22:36.843 --> 22:38.277
No, not them. Your brother.

22:38.443 --> 22:41.117
First couple of hours,
he is a total prick.

22:41.283 --> 22:43.677
Then, he practically tells me
my own life story.

22:43.843 --> 22:45.117
You know what that means, don't you?

22:45.283 --> 22:46.277
What?

22:46.443 --> 22:48.117
He's looking to get
into your knickers.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.272
He's a fucking priest.

22:50.273 --> 22:53.717
Look, don't take it personally, but
it's what he does. It's his thing.

22:54.883 --> 22:57.077
Had you spoken to
Dominic before today?

22:57.243 --> 22:58.077
No.

22:58.243 --> 23:00.576
So, he's rude to you,

23:00.577 --> 23:02.152
behaves like a dick
because at least then,

23:02.683 --> 23:04.437
he's on your radar. Next step...

23:04.603 --> 23:07.272
he'll turn that negative impression
into a positive,

23:07.273 --> 23:10.277
so he sweeps you off your feet
by making a casual, but bang on

23:10.443 --> 23:12.237
insight into your character.

23:12.403 --> 23:14.832
He's a dirty bastard.

23:14.833 --> 23:18.597
Mmm-hmm. And the rest.

23:53.193 --> 23:56.112
We need to start doing food
at teatime. This is ridiculous.

23:56.113 --> 23:58.912
Oh, and you're going to play
Gordon Ramsay, are you?

23:58.913 --> 24:02.912
No. His language
is fucking atrocious.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.517
What do you think of him?

24:09.683 --> 24:11.677
He loves the legend of himself,
that's for sure.

24:11.843 --> 24:13.837
Quite a shagger, by all accounts.

24:14.003 --> 24:16.952
Yeah. If he can get it up,
with the amount that he puts away.

24:16.953 --> 24:19.117
Is that true?
Some men can't... (WHISTLES)?

24:19.283 --> 24:21.997
How would I know? Have you seen me?

24:22.163 --> 24:23.432
(THEY LAUGH)

24:23.433 --> 24:25.752
I like him.

24:25.753 --> 24:26.717
Who?

24:26.883 --> 24:30.792
The priest.

24:30.993 --> 24:32.643
Spit it out.

24:34.969 --> 24:37.717
- He bet me he could shag you.
- Come again?

24:40.433 --> 24:43.877
He bet me he could get you into bed
and if he does, he wins me.

24:45.243 --> 24:49.152
He's looking to sleep with you
to get to me. Sorry.

24:58.313 --> 25:00.477

30:11.923 --> 30:14.557
It's the one you were wearing
the first time your dad...

30:14.723 --> 30:18.572
I know what it is.

30:21.283 --> 30:23.397
- I killed him, you know.
- Good.

30:23.563 --> 30:25.597
- And I killed me mother.
- No, you didn't.

30:25.763 --> 30:27.397
Yes, I fucking did!

30:27.563 --> 30:29.277
If I hadn't let him,
she wouldn't be a depressive

30:29.443 --> 30:30.877
and thrown herself
off a balcony!

30:31.373 --> 30:32.692
What would you have done?

30:32.693 --> 30:35.997
Run around with a safety net and
caught her, like Tom and Jerry?

30:36.163 --> 30:38.172
Now who's being cruel?

30:38.173 --> 30:39.597
(LAUGHS)

30:39.763 --> 30:40.837
What the fuck are you on?

30:41.003 --> 30:42.877

Where is that noise coming from?

You. It's coming from you.

CRYING AND HEARTBEATS

30:53.973 --> 30:55.117
I lost our baby.

30:55.283 --> 30:57.557
There's no blame - it's nature.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.557
Sometimes a body's not ready.

30:59.723 --> 31:01.557
- I'm tired.
- I know you are,

31:01.723 --> 31:03.637
But you're dying,
choking on your puke.

31:03.803 --> 31:06.757
And you're not responsible
for your mam, or him,

31:06.923 --> 31:10.277
or the baby - that's all bollocks.
You are responsible for her, though.

31:10.443 --> 31:13.132

32:06.763 --> 32:09.532
Can you see us?
Or have we faded away to nothing

32:09.533 --> 32:12.812
due to the lack of milk?

32:12.813 --> 32:14.917
I do have a life, ladies.

32:20.413 --> 32:23.877
That's very gratifying,
but we have no milk.

32:27.103 --> 32:29.877
I was in my pyjamas
when I got this out the fridge,

32:30.043 --> 32:33.382
Now I'm dressed, how d' you suppose
I get it through the sleeve?

32:33.383 --> 32:36.742
You get just as much calcium
and stuff from skimmed, you know.

32:36.743 --> 32:39.542
Yes, but you need to use a pint
of the fecking stuff

32:39.543 --> 32:41.197
to turn a cup of tea white.

32:43.763 --> 32:44.797
Have you been tagged?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.797
Have you got an AS-BLO?

32:46.963 --> 32:48.437
I'm in training.

32:48.603 --> 32:50.437
What for?

32:50.603 --> 32:51.957
Cos I like it?

32:52.123 --> 32:54.422
Running for pleasure...

32:54.423 --> 32:57.862
God's way of telling you
you've too much time on your hands.

33:29.363 --> 33:31.822
Seriously, I've fucking had it
with the men around here.

33:31.823 --> 33:33.742
Oh all right, easy, Braveheart.

33:33.743 --> 33:36.037
Don't go painting your face blue
just yet.

33:36.203 --> 33:38.077
Do you ever say anything positive?

33:38.243 --> 33:40.182
Why did she take the bet?

33:40.183 --> 33:44.182
What?

33:45.223 --> 33:47.462
In the Jockey?

33:47.463 --> 33:49.677
Two little pussy cats.

33:49.843 --> 33:51.837
"Quite the shagger,
by all accounts."

33:52.003 --> 33:54.422
"How would I know -
have you seen me?"

33:54.423 --> 33:56.422
Why...

33:56.423 --> 34:00.342
did she... accept the bet?

34:00.343 --> 34:01.517
Because she wants him to win.

34:01.683 --> 34:03.077
Cos...?

34:03.243 --> 34:04.917
Because then he'd have to shag her.

34:05.083 --> 34:07.277
Hole in one.
Or two, as the case may be.

34:07.443 --> 34:09.181
Then why was she trying to put me
off him?

34:09.183 --> 34:10.877
It's a double bluff...

34:11.043 --> 34:13.677
Feeding into your perverse,
chip-on-both-shoulders

34:13.842 --> 34:17.742
Celtic temperament - warn you off,
so you'll go running towards him,

34:18.063 --> 34:22.062
throwing both legs
over your shoulders as you go.

34:22.223 --> 34:23.197
Why do you care?

34:23.362 --> 34:26.342
I don't - not even a little bit.

34:26.342 --> 34:28.181
I simply expect you to furnish me

34:28.183 --> 34:31.956
with cigarettes
and alcohol by way of thanks.

34:34.703 --> 34:36.502
So you bet on me?

34:36.503 --> 34:37.982
Fucking hell!

34:37.983 --> 34:40.422
You accepted the bet
because you want to fuck him.

34:40.422 --> 34:43.022
Keep your voice down.
I do not want to fuck him.

34:43.023 --> 34:45.342
It is not going to happen.
It was a laugh and I'll call it off.

34:45.342 --> 34:46.982
No, you fucking won't,

34:46.983 --> 34:50.141
because you don't get to have
all the fun.

34:50.143 --> 34:52.302
Why, what are you going to do?

34:52.303 --> 34:55.956
The expression on your face -
now, that's a laugh.

35:20.643 --> 35:24.197
He's also a pharmacist. Any trouble,
it'll be last in, first out.

Take your time mate, honestly -
it's not heavy, this stuff(!)

think of your job...

35:33.063 --> 35:37.062
Come on!

35:39.643 --> 35:42.142
Er, Jamie was shouting down for you.

You're good.

35:50.043 --> 35:52.157

35:52.323 --> 35:54.102
You whisper truths into women's
ears,

35:54.103 --> 35:56.997
then catch their knickers
when they swoon - a clever trick.

35:57.163 --> 35:58.877
Oh, no, no - it's not a trick.

35:59.043 --> 36:02.102
Don't be defensive -
no-one's criticising.

36:02.103 --> 36:04.942
It's worked. Drink up.

You what?

36:07.643 --> 36:09.477
Where we going?

36:09.643 --> 36:13.637
I'm going to fuck you
rather spectacularly, Dom.

36:13.803 --> 36:17.662
I'm a very fit girl.

36:17.663 --> 36:21.582
OK.

36:21.583 --> 36:25.062
You know, sometimes it's like having
two bloody kids...

36:25.063 --> 36:28.022
I lived with a fella once,
used to re-use cling-film...

36:28.023 --> 36:31.917
kitchen walls were covered with it,
"Just in case."

36:41.503 --> 36:43.862
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:43.863 --> 36:45.822
Wait.

36:45.823 --> 36:46.837
Let's not stop.

36:47.003 --> 36:50.062
No, I mean it.

36:50.063 --> 36:53.902
I really like sex, Dom.

36:53.903 --> 36:56.797
Truth be told,
I'm a pretty dirty girl.

36:56.963 --> 36:58.157
But I have one condition.

36:58.323 --> 37:02.062
Name it, anything.

37:02.063 --> 37:05.582
Nobody finds out about this.

37:05.583 --> 37:08.342
- You think I'd kiss and tell?
- Nobody.

37:08.343 --> 37:11.757
Not even Karen.

37:11.923 --> 37:15.892
Why would you think...?

37:16.093 --> 37:18.532
OK.

37:18.533 --> 37:20.597
Not even Karen.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.917
No.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.797
Do not go in the locker.
It's none of your business.

37:35.963 --> 37:37.277
Too late.

37:37.443 --> 37:38.997
I'm in.

37:39.163 --> 37:40.912
And it is my business.

37:40.913 --> 37:43.432
Only takes good people to do nothing

37:43.433 --> 37:46.837
for bad people to... do stuff.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.477
You saved one life, I'm proud
of you, but you're not

37:49.643 --> 37:52.632
suddenly a superhero.
You can't save everybody.

37:52.633 --> 37:54.512
I would. Be the Silver Surfer, me.

Saying that, can't do fuck all,
can he? Fill that suit, though.

38:00.273 --> 38:01.237
I've got something!

38:01.403 --> 38:02.477
Don't touch it!

38:02.643 --> 38:04.597
Leave it!

38:04.763 --> 38:07.197
I'll catch you up.
All right, see you.

38:07.883 --> 38:09.357
Fuck, he's coming.

38:09.523 --> 38:11.037
Avril...

38:11.203 --> 38:12.192
Avril!

38:12.193 --> 38:14.157
Scrap that. Lex Luthor.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.912
Say what you gotta say,
leave a message.

38:26.913 --> 38:30.912
Avril, give me a ring
when you get this message.

38:31.793 --> 38:34.792
All right?

38:34.793 --> 38:35.717
Fine.

38:35.883 --> 38:37.157
Were you...

38:37.323 --> 38:38.752
waiting for me?

38:38.753 --> 38:42.752
(SCOFFS)

39:15.763 --> 39:16.957
Where are they?

39:17.123 --> 39:18.432
I don't know what you mean.

39:18.433 --> 39:20.997
What the fuck makes
you think you can play God?

39:21.163 --> 39:24.032
I need 'em, and I'll go wherever
I've gotta go to get them.

39:24.033 --> 39:26.157
Really? That's where
we're going with this?

39:26.323 --> 39:30.272
You're going to force your hand
up my muff, searching for pills?

39:31.673 --> 39:34.512
I thought you had a pocket.

39:34.513 --> 39:37.072
Hold on,
you put my pills up your fanny?

39:37.073 --> 39:41.072
Wait, are you going to dob me in?

40:08.593 --> 40:09.717
Wait... stop!

40:09.883 --> 40:13.832
Stop the bus!

40:59.273 --> 41:03.272
I'm sorry.

41:07.753 --> 41:11.752
I do love you.

41:12.913 --> 41:16.912
I know.

41:20.473 --> 41:21.877
I'm so tired.

41:22.043 --> 41:23.877
I know. But it's OK.

41:38.603 --> 41:40.392
You could've lost your job.

41:40.393 --> 41:41.872
Yeah, but I didn't.

41:41.873 --> 41:43.437
Mum, can I have some money?

41:43.603 --> 41:46.072
Nothing about this
makes you uncomfortable?

41:46.073 --> 41:48.757
He's taken a month's leave
to sort himself out,

41:48.923 --> 41:51.117
- go into rehab somewhere.
- All thanks to you?

41:51.283 --> 41:52.792
That wasn't a compliment.

41:52.793 --> 41:53.957
Hello?

41:54.123 --> 41:55.637
I tell you what, though.

41:55.803 --> 41:58.597
My job is a fucking rush.

41:58.763 --> 42:02.512
Mum, can I have some money?

42:02.513 --> 42:03.637
Have you been smoking?

42:03.803 --> 42:05.637
No.

42:05.803 --> 42:08.717
Don't lie to me. I will know.

42:08.883 --> 42:12.437
I had one single puff.

42:12.603 --> 42:16.552
Do you know how bad
cigarettes are for you?

42:20.073 --> 42:23.557
They came out my pocket.

42:24.603 --> 42:26.432
Oh aye. The late shift's arrived.

42:26.433 --> 42:29.957
I'm off for some grub.

42:34.163 --> 42:36.672
Well... time's up.

42:36.673 --> 42:40.512
Got any news for me?

42:40.513 --> 42:44.232
No. I couldn't pull it off.

42:44.233 --> 42:46.837
Sure?

42:47.003 --> 42:48.832
Yep.

42:48.833 --> 42:51.317
Unfortunately.

42:51.483 --> 42:55.432
Unless we could make another bet?

42:56.193 --> 42:59.552
I don't think so.

42:59.553 --> 43:02.197
Thanks for the advice last night.

43:02.363 --> 43:06.157
Big help.

43:08.403 --> 43:09.397
Aargh!

43:09.563 --> 43:11.952
You made a bet on me, Dom.

43:11.953 --> 43:13.157
That was a mistake.

43:13.323 --> 43:15.797
It was just a bit of fun,
that's all.

43:43.353 --> 43:44.392

Hey...

43:45.473 --> 43:48.997
You fuck off and get your tea.

43:57.473 --> 43:58.757
Get me a large vodka.

43:58.923 --> 44:00.752
OK.

44:00.753 --> 44:03.477
I've just stripped all my bedding.
Washing my sheets.

44:03.643 --> 44:05.717
Don't sleep with women
in my bed, Dominic.

44:05.883 --> 44:09.837
It was beyond my control.

44:31.793 --> 44:33.957
You know you're always welcome here.

44:34.123 --> 44:34.997
Family or not.

44:35.163 --> 44:38.117
- You look more like yourself.
- We've missed you.

44:38.283 --> 44:39.437
Worried about you.

44:39.603 --> 44:41.437
Could've gone out
in a blaze of glory.

44:41.603 --> 44:45.552
Look how disappointed he is.

44:47.953 --> 44:51.952
I'm parched.

44:53.603 --> 44:56.472
Pint for my boy,
and a vodka tonic for me.

44:56.473 --> 44:58.517
Just the one. Not a bucket-load.

44:58.683 --> 45:00.837
Deceit is a sneaky bastard.

45:01.003 --> 45:03.837
Always bites you
on the arse eventually.

45:04.003 --> 45:06.632
You finally, unavoidably,
have to face yourself.

45:06.633 --> 45:07.557
Sorry, pal.

45:07.723 --> 45:11.157
Fuck off.

45:16.683 --> 45:20.632
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Please forgive me for it all

45:25.643 --> 45:27.992
Kelly Ball.

45:27.993 --> 45:29.197
Electric's dangerous, dickhead.

45:29.363 --> 45:30.637
Aargh!

45:31.163 --> 45:32.597
I was adopted.

45:32.763 --> 45:36.237
Can't get my head round a mother keeping
one baby and giving another away.

45:36.403 --> 45:38.317
You're adopted. It's a real shame.

45:38.483 --> 45:39.757
Where's me coat?

45:39.923 --> 45:41.957
It's just a coat, mate.

45:42.123 --> 45:43.197
That parka was me.

45:43.363 --> 45:45.077
Pack it in!

45:45.243 --> 45:48.717
You've got some fucking balls
going for a Maguire.

45:48.883 --> 45:52.832
It's been a really strange night.

46:34.083 --> 46:35.152
(MOANS)

46:35.153 --> 46:39.152
I think I'm starting
to feel quite trippy.

46:40.313 --> 46:44.312
(CHOKES)

46:50.433 --> 46:54.432
Shall we share?

46:57.683 --> 47:01.072
