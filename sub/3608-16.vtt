00:02.001 --> 00:03.461
Previously on Lost:

00:03.545 --> 00:04.962
Help me.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.256
- He's one of them.
- My name is Henry Gale.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.424
I'm from Minnesota.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.010
You're making a serious mistake.

00:11.095 --> 00:14.639
For a long time, he will lie.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.393
He is one of them.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.151
She's OK. She's gonna be all right.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.238
- Where'd you find her?
- Just outside her garden.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.436
You were running
like the devil's chasing you.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.649
Maybe he is.

05:17.401 --> 05:21.278
- Good for you, keeping in shape.
- What do you want, Locke?

05:23.156 --> 05:26.158
- What do I want?
- I've been here over a week.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.619
You've never said two words to me

05:28.704 --> 05:32.415
and now you're sitting outside my tent?

05:32.499 --> 05:35.209
We got a man locked up
down in the hatch.

05:35.293 --> 05:39.463
There's a possibility
he's one of them, the Others.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.383
- Who's "we"?
- Me and Jack.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.553
He's keeping watch right now.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.639
- How long's he been down there?
- Three days.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.020
I'd like you to talk with him.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.856
You have experience with the Others.
You were a cop.

05:56.940 --> 06:01.110
You're the most qualified to figure out
if this man's telling the truth.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.238
Does Jack know
you're coming to me with this?

06:08.326 --> 06:11.203
We got a serious problem, Ana Lucia.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.289
All of us.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.710
I'm taking the necessary steps
to solve it.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.171
I don't need Jack's permission.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.674
Right now there's a man
sitting in a room in my hatch,

06:23.759 --> 06:25.760
and I want him out.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.230
I don't wanna give you anything.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.067
It's the thought that counts,
and you didn't think.

06:41.151 --> 06:45.237
I think all the time. Maybe you should
think about giving me a break.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.698
Just hush, Bernard. Just hush.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.618
Honey.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.954
Are you all right?

06:55.248 --> 06:58.834
I'm... I think
I'm just a little light-headed.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.963
- Well, you look as pale as a sheet.
- Well, give her some water.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.716
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't pay him any mind, honey.

07:05.801 --> 07:09.637
He's just mad at the world
because he forgot my birthday.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.307
I didn't forget. I don't even know
what day of the week it is, Rose.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.768
It's Saturday, Bernard.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.438
- Honey, can you walk?
- Really, I'm all right.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.440
- Maybe we should go get Jin.
- No.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.779
I think I was just
out in the sun too long.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.449
You spend a lot of time around the baby.
Maybe you caught something.

07:30.534 --> 07:34.411
- At least talk to Jack.
- Really, I'm OK.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.997
Thank you, both of you.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.080
In English.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.499
I'll...

09:05.503 --> 09:10.758
I would like an iced tea, please.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.302
- Very good.
- Thank you.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.030
Morning, Jack.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.244
You couldn't wait
until I was done in here?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.621
The steam opens up my pores.

10:22.706 --> 10:26.250
Man's got no shaving cream,
he's got to improvise.

10:26.334 --> 10:31.130
I also thought this might be a good time
to talk about our problem.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.799
- Our problem?
- Our Henry problem.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.926
We've had him locked up
for three days.

10:36.011 --> 10:40.889
I get the sense that he's just
not motivated to cooperate with us.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.267
And how are we gonna
motivate him, John?

10:43.351 --> 10:47.646
There's nothing we can do.
We need to bring in some new blood.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.898
Obviously you have someone in mind.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.568
What do you think about Ana Lucia?

10:53.945 --> 10:55.779
Why her?

10:55.864 --> 10:59.158
She's the one you went to
to start an army to fight these people.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.243
Why not her?

11:01.328 --> 11:04.246
Unless you're worried
about what she'll do to him.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.294
- I'll talk to her.
- I already did.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.506
In there with him now.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.182
Were you on the plane, too?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.311
I was in the tail section.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.855
We crashed
on the other side of the island.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.691
You walked across? All the way here?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.695
That must have been fun.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.781
It had its moments.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.285
So, you gonna tell me your story, Henry?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.371
Why bother? I've told it to everyone.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.124
Jack, Locke, the big black guy
that cut off his beard in front of me.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.210
Oh, yeah, and my buddy, Sayid.

11:51.294 --> 11:55.881
- You see how much he liked my story.
- So, how about you try me?

11:55.965 --> 12:00.344
I don't mean to be ungrateful, but why
are you gonna help me get out of here?

12:01.805 --> 12:06.225
On the other side of the island,
there was this guy with us.

12:06.309 --> 12:10.521
I was 100% convinced
that he wasn't on the plane.

12:10.605 --> 12:14.650
So I dug a hole and I threw him in it.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.153
And what happened?

12:19.823 --> 12:24.284
I was wrong, and now he's dead.

12:26.162 --> 12:30.499
But good news for you, Henry.
I don't make the same mistake twice.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.293
So, how about you tell me your story?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.928
Sawyer.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.893
Well, hey there, sunshine.
What can I do for you?

12:49.978 --> 12:52.438
How's your book?

12:52.522 --> 12:56.233
Predictable. Not nearly enough sex.

13:02.532 --> 13:06.368
I heard that you have
all the medical supplies.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.957
- You heard correct.
- May I look through them?

13:12.041 --> 13:16.378
No, you may not. But if you'll tell me
what you're looking for...

13:16.463 --> 13:18.464
Forget it.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.551
OK. Hold on.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.305
Now I'm intrigued.

13:26.389 --> 13:30.767
Tell you what, tell me what you're
looking for, and it's yours, gratis.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.145
Can't I just look myself?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.731
It's not a drugstore, sweetheart.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.906
I need...

13:46.576 --> 13:48.952
a pregnancy test.

14:02.926 --> 14:06.428
- I can't hear anything.
- She's only been in there 30 minutes.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.514
He might have snapped her neck, John.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.766
How do you know she hasn't snapped his?

14:11.851 --> 14:15.187
So, you and your wife
travel around the world

14:15.271 --> 14:17.814
and crash here in a smiley-face balloon.

14:17.899 --> 14:22.402
Then she dies, you get captured
by a French chick who brings you here,

14:22.487 --> 14:24.655
and then they lock you up.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.782
Sounds silly when you say it like that.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.410
- Why don't you have a beard?
- Because I shaved.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.081
Because I needed something normal.

14:34.916 --> 14:39.711
OK. So, why don't you draw me
a map to your balloon?

14:39.796 --> 14:42.965
We'll go out there, find it,
and everybody'll believe you.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.634
They all keep asking me to draw a map.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.719
And if I mess up, they'll crucify me.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.347
You flew around the world in a balloon,

14:50.431 --> 14:52.391
and you don't think
you can draw a map?

14:52.475 --> 14:56.562
Air travel, it's a different animal.
It's about wind currents...

14:56.646 --> 14:59.648
Do you or do you not know where it is?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.818
Yeah, I know where it is.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.699
I went back there to bury my wife.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.580
Why'd you do that?

15:14.664 --> 15:17.833
Because that balloon
was the closest thing we had to home.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.798
You people have been looking
for someone to punish

15:24.882 --> 15:27.634
for everything that's happened,
someone to blame,

15:27.719 --> 15:30.053
and now you've got him.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.516
It doesn't matter what I do.
I'm dead already.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.481
You draw up that map, Henry.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.943
I'll find your balloon.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.779
But if you don't,

15:47.864 --> 15:51.575
things are gonna play out
just like you said.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.476
Hey, Sun.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.065
Look what I found in the jungle.

16:23.149 --> 16:27.694
It's not even melted or nothing.
Crazy, huh?

16:30.239 --> 16:32.282
D'you wanna split it?

16:32.367 --> 16:34.826
No. No, thank you.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.998
I was just heading to the beach.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.586
OK. Well, later, dude.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.383
Coming out.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.321
He told me the same story he told you.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.365
- You believe him?
- I don't know yet.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.826
I need more time with him.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.495
- He's all yours.
- Tomorrow.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.081
I wanna give him some time to think.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.461
If that's OK with you.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.632
I didn't tell anyone, Ana.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.010
No worries, man.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.190
Bit large for a dining-room table.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.860
If we cut them in two,
it will suit the purpose.

19:55.486 --> 19:58.864
Sayid, can I talk to you?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.994
Of course.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.747
Alone?

20:08.499 --> 20:11.710
Whatever you need to say,
you can say it here.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.589
- It's about the hatch.
- The guy locked in the closet there?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.885
What about him?

20:30.771 --> 20:33.481
It's to his balloon.

20:33.566 --> 20:37.944
- How did you get him to do this?
- I asked nicely.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.573
Do Jack and Locke know about this?

20:41.657 --> 20:46.411
Jack and Locke are a little too busy
worrying about Locke and Jack.

20:48.289 --> 20:51.082
All I wanna know
is if this guy's telling the truth.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.918
Why come to me?

20:53.002 --> 20:57.005
Judging from what you did to his face,
that's what you want, too.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.717
This is at least a day's walk.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.803
Then we should get going.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.663
- You OK?
- Fine. Thanks.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.260
That cliff there appears to be this.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.554
Score one for Henry.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.475
Pointing out a touchstone does not mean
he's leading us to a balloon.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.561
Maybe not, but at least
we're on the right island.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.693
Humor's not his strong suit.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.406
And I'm saying this to you.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.461
- You looking at my bum?
- No, I'm looking at your gun.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.171
My what?

22:20.256 --> 22:24.217
Maybe you should give the gun
to somebody who knows how to use it.

22:24.927 --> 22:29.472
Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time
you had a gun you murdered someone.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.558
That's enough.

22:42.486 --> 22:46.781
We'll go as far as the base of the cliff
and we'll camp there.

22:55.291 --> 22:59.294
- How long is it supposed to take?
- Up to two minutes.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.886
- I'm sorry. I'm just...
- I know.

23:09.305 --> 23:12.557
Where did Sawyer
find one of these, anyway?

23:12.641 --> 23:16.352
I mean, who flies
with a pregnancy test, right?

23:17.646 --> 23:20.607
Have you ever taken one?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.861
Yeah.

23:27.865 --> 23:31.326
Thank you for waiting with me

23:31.410 --> 23:36.372
and not asking
why you're here and not Jin.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.626
You're welcome.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.842
It's time.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.025
You're pregnant.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.950
Is it 100% sure?

24:13.327 --> 24:15.703
There's only one way to find out.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.250
These tests are pretty accurate.

24:20.334 --> 24:25.588
A false negative in the first week,
maybe, but a positive is a positive.

24:26.215 --> 24:29.968
- But it's impossible.
- Oh, no, it's possible.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.804
Are you feeling queasy, light-headed?

24:32.888 --> 24:35.640
Please, Jack, this is private.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.809
Nobody can know.

24:37.893 --> 24:42.272
- You're not gonna tell Jin?
- In time, I will. It's just...

24:44.817 --> 24:46.067
It's complicated.

24:46.152 --> 24:50.446
As complicated as Jin being the last one
here to find out you spoke English?

24:51.574 --> 24:53.825
Sun, my advice, and it's just that,

24:53.909 --> 24:58.663
because I'm the last person to ask
about this, but you should tell him.

24:58.747 --> 25:02.250
And when you do, you should
tell him everything, the whole truth.

25:05.254 --> 25:09.465
I've gotta get back to the hatch.
Congratulations, Sun.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.262
You've been down there a lot, Jack.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.682
Is everything OK?

25:17.766 --> 25:21.060
Sure. Yeah. Everything's fine.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.484
You OK?

25:30.279 --> 25:38.620
Sun?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.374
Sun, are you all right?

25:46.295 --> 25:47.962
Yes, I'm fine.

25:48.047 --> 25:52.675
You were distracted
for our entire lesson. You're not fine.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.392
We...

26:02.061 --> 26:04.062
Jin and I went to see a doctor.

26:07.316 --> 26:10.401
He said I cannot have children.

26:11.612 --> 26:14.822
I'm very sorry, Sun.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.410
I was glad.

27:16.719 --> 27:21.389
I'm not saying you should stay for Jin.

27:48.751 --> 27:50.752
You mind?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.512
You should sleep while you can.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.932
Yeah. I can't sleep.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.985
People don't like me.

28:18.572 --> 28:21.699
I've tried to get them to
most of my life, but...

28:24.078 --> 28:27.121
I guess I just gave up a while back.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.958
I mean...

28:33.295 --> 28:35.296
I am what I am.

28:39.301 --> 28:44.972
But you, you've got
a good reason to hate me.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.274
I'm sorry.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.070
I'm sorry for what I did.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.207
You were trying to protect your people.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.964
It wasn't you that killed Shannon,
it was them.

29:21.009 --> 29:24.011
And once we find out he is one of them,

29:26.181 --> 29:28.808
then something will have to be done.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.576
What?

29:46.660 --> 29:48.202
Nothing.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.790
It's gonna rain.

29:52.875 --> 29:56.252
- We should get moving.
- Morning. Who wants breakfast?

29:56.336 --> 29:59.130
I have papayas and papayas.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.382
Let's go.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.634
Right. Why eat?

30:16.398 --> 30:17.899
This is it.

30:24.239 --> 30:27.909
This balloon,
it would be rather large, right?

30:27.993 --> 30:30.495
Why am I not surprised?

30:31.747 --> 30:35.917
- We need to look some more.
- This is where he said it would be.

30:36.001 --> 30:40.755
If I'm gonna back your play on this,
Sayid, we need to be sure.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.261
I'll divide the area into three grids.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.766
We'll search as thoroughly
as you please.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.117
Oh, for the love of God.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.547
No, no, no, no. It's not for fish.
No, no, no.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.632
Oysters.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.261
Oyster.

31:28.345 --> 31:32.139
Pearl. For Rose. Pearl.

31:35.978 --> 31:39.355
No oyster. No oyster here.

31:39.439 --> 31:43.568
Of course not. Why would there be?

31:43.652 --> 31:45.653
Yo, Daddy-o.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.574
- Sawyer.
- Way to go, Papa-san.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.243
You didn't waste much time.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.787
I'd give you a cigar, Bernie,
but I'm fresh out.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.790
- Sun's pregnant?
- Keep it down, there, Suzy.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.543
I don't think Jin senior here knows yet.

38:43.863 --> 38:48.242
I love you.

39:33.997 --> 39:36.331
How is it?

39:36.416 --> 39:39.376
"Men reject their prophets
and slay them,

39:39.461 --> 39:43.881
but they love their martyrs and honor
those whom they have slain."

39:43.965 --> 39:47.885
So what's the difference
between a martyr and a prophet?

39:47.969 --> 39:51.055
Either way,
it sounds like you end up dead.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.433
That's the spirit.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.023
You in the mood for some breakfast?

40:16.539 --> 40:19.750
- What's the computer for?
- Nothing.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.591
Cereal.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.844
Wow. Where'd you guys get cereal?

40:30.929 --> 40:34.848
It was down here all along.
Pantry's full of food.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.477
How old is it?

40:42.565 --> 40:45.275
You guys don't know much, huh?

40:45.360 --> 40:49.404
I'd be asking all kinds of questions
about all this stuff down here.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.532
You guys don't even seem that curious.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.118
Do you want the cereal or don't you?

40:57.413 --> 40:59.915
This must be my reward
for good behavior, huh?

40:59.999 --> 41:04.253
I guess I earned myself some goodwill
for finally drawing that map for Ana.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.798
What map?

41:08.716 --> 41:10.509
To my balloon.

41:11.261 --> 41:12.928
- Did you...?
- No.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.726
Wow. You guys have
some real trust issues, don't you?

41:22.021 --> 41:25.065
I guess it makes sense
she didn't tell you.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.860
I mean, with the two of you
fighting all the time.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.824
Of course, if I was one of them,

41:33.908 --> 41:37.119
these people that you seem to think
are your enemies,

41:37.203 --> 41:39.538
what would I do?

41:42.458 --> 41:45.210
Well, there'd be no balloon.

41:47.422 --> 41:51.383
So I'd draw a map
to a real secluded place,

41:51.467 --> 41:54.636
like a cave or some underbrush.

41:54.721 --> 41:56.722
A good place for a trap.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.602
An ambush.

42:03.730 --> 42:09.151
And when your friends got there, a bunch
of my people'd be waiting for them.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.864
And then they'd use them
to trade for me.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.660
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

42:25.126 --> 42:27.753
You guys got any milk?
