00:02.335 --> 00:03.878
- Hi.
Can I help you?

00:03.961 --> 00:05.714
- I hope so.
My name is Liana.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.507
I'm looking for Jax Novoa.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.092
He said I could
find him here?

00:09.175 --> 00:10.885
- Mrs. Novoa.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.971
- It's Woods.
Ms. Woods.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.389
Is Jax here?

00:14.472 --> 00:16.641
- Not right now,
but--but he will be soon.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.976
- Do you think
I could wait inside?

00:18.059 --> 00:19.728
I don't think it's safe
for me out here.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.938
I think
I'm being followed.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.356
- Uh, of course.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.277
Who would be
following you?

00:27.360 --> 00:28.486
- I'm not sure.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.696
I don't know
what you've heard,

00:29.779 --> 00:31.114
but things have been
a little chaotic

00:31.197 --> 00:32.448
for our family lately.

00:32.531 --> 00:33.199
- Man, I love mysteries!

00:34.617 --> 00:36.411
- Get down!

00:37.078 --> 00:38.580
- Oh, no! The door!

00:38.663 --> 00:39.831
We forgot to lock it!

00:39.914 --> 00:41.291
- Quick, cast a spell!

00:41.374 --> 00:43.626
- It's too late!

- Em?

- Jax.
- Mom!

01:24.584 --> 01:27.086
- Hey! Feeling kind of
left out over here.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.296
- Mom, what are you...

01:28.379 --> 01:29.130
Whoa!

01:29.589 --> 01:32.050
Ow.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.259
A little help?

01:33.343 --> 01:34.093
- Sorry.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.765
We thought you were
someone else.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.937
We'll give you two
some privacy.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.773
- We will?

01:48.650 --> 01:50.318
- You...
you came.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.528
- Of course I did.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.695
Did you think
I'd pass up

01:52.779 --> 01:53.947
another chance
to see you again?

01:54.030 --> 01:55.907
- No, it's just...

01:55.990 --> 01:57.325
Well, we never
got the chance to...

01:57.408 --> 02:00.203
I-I just have so much
that I have to...

02:00.286 --> 02:01.329
- I know.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.373
You must have
a million questions.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.166
- Did you know
where I was living?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.001
How come you didn't
come and get me?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.502
Can you move your nostrils
like this?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.588
I know Dad can't, so it must be,
like, a hereditary thing.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.340
I must've gotten it
from you.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.343
- I know we have
a lot of catching up to do,

02:15.426 --> 02:17.720
and I think I can
answer everything,

02:17.804 --> 02:19.681
but we should probably
start from the beginning.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.059
- We decided to have
Jessie evaluated.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.062
- "We"?
- Myself and the Council.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.064
I'll be taking her into
the Realm later this week.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.149
They'll be able
to assess her prowess.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.818
- Jake, I don't know
about this...

02:31.901 --> 02:34.571
- I'm trying to raise powerful
witches and wizards, Liana.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.574
Ones that are capable
of ruling the Realm one day.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.117
- Well, I'm trying to raise
happy kids, Jake.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.411
Ones that will be
capable of being

02:41.494 --> 02:42.912
happy and healthy
one day.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.873
- Such low expectations.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.167
I'm taking her,
and that's final.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.004
<i>MS. WOODS:</i>
<i>I knew if he took her,</i>

02:51.087 --> 02:53.631
<i>she'd never be mine again.</i>

02:53.715 --> 02:55.758
<i>I don't know much</i>
<i>about the Realm,</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:57.760
<i>but I know</i>
<i>it's a dangerous place.</i>

02:57.844 --> 03:00.889
<i>So I did what any</i>
<i>protective mother would do.</i>

03:00.972 --> 03:03.057
<i>I planned to leave</i>
<i>with both of you.</i>

03:05.685 --> 03:07.312
<i>MR. NOVOA:</i>
<i>Liana?</i>

03:20.158 --> 03:22.160
- I knew it might be my only
chance to save Jessie.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.455
I wanted
to take you so badly.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.289
I still think about it
every day.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.460
Whatever you're thinking
or feeling,

03:30.543 --> 03:31.836
I want to hear it.
Please.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.380
- That was...intense!

03:35.882 --> 03:37.926
- So why didn't you
come back for me?

03:38.009 --> 03:40.345
- I went to the Van Pelts
for protection.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.721
I knew I couldn't hide
from your father on my own.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.974
They said it was too risky
for me to come back and get you.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.185
- [sighs]
Making walls in my sleep...

03:47.268 --> 03:49.479
Why did I have to be
such a wizard wunderkind?

03:49.562 --> 03:52.482
- Honey, you didn't know
what you were capable of.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.359
You were only seven.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.985
Look, none of that
matters now.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.195
We're together,

03:57.278 --> 03:58.404
and we have to
get Jessie back

03:58.488 --> 04:00.198
so we can all
be together.

04:00.281 --> 04:00.406
Look, here.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.077
This is yours.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.287
- Captain El Capitan!
This was my favorite!

04:09.123 --> 04:10.667
I-I mean...

04:10.750 --> 04:13.252
it's kind of cool
for a toy.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.837
- It's okay.
I'm not gonna make fun of you.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.589
Just this once.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.466
- Dad said he accidentally
threw this out.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.928
- No, I kept it
this whole time.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.471
I knew you'd want it back,

04:23.554 --> 04:26.140
if I ever got the chance
to see you again.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.976
But you're too big.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.477
So many years.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.564
- Did you see that?

04:33.648 --> 04:36.651
How I held myself back
from dissing Jax?

04:36.734 --> 04:37.986
I've grown so much.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.155
Emma?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.366
Yo, Em!
[snaps fingers]

04:43.449 --> 04:44.325
You okay?

04:44.409 --> 04:45.451
- Yeah, it's just--

04:46.619 --> 04:47.787
Well, losing your mom

04:47.870 --> 04:48.329
and then getting her back?

04:50.248 --> 04:52.917
I'd do anything
to have that.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.339
[knocking]

04:58.423 --> 04:59.632
<i>URSULA: Maddie Winky?</i>

04:59.716 --> 05:01.050
<i>How's it going in here?</i>

05:01.134 --> 05:03.511
<i>Did you find something</i>
<i>that screams "reunion fab"?</i>

05:08.307 --> 05:08.891
What, uh...

05:08.975 --> 05:11.310
What is that?

05:11.394 --> 05:11.936
- Oh, relax.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.604
It's Italian.

05:13.688 --> 05:17.400
- Oh, is this some new trend
that I haven't heard about?

05:17.483 --> 05:20.695
Oh! If it is, could you
get me one in fuchsia?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.071
- It's my...

05:22.155 --> 05:24.741
"lay in bed
and wallow in misery" outfit.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.825
- Oh.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.744
Well, in that case,
it's nothing

05:27.827 --> 05:29.579
that a quick makeover
won't fix.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.831
Girls?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.919
- Look, I'm not going
to the reunion.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.588
I'm not sure I'll ever
get out of this bed...

05:39.922 --> 05:43.593
Or out of this onesie
ever again.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.720
- Ooh! Does that mean
your shoe collection

05:45.803 --> 05:47.013
will be up for grabs?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.931
- Yeah, yeah,
it's all yours.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.102
- Oh...

05:53.186 --> 05:55.354
She's so beautiful.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.731
Even in ketchup.

05:57.857 --> 05:58.775
- Okay, so I've been

05:58.858 --> 06:00.735
giving it a lot of thought
lately,

06:00.818 --> 06:03.237
and I think
it's definitely time.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.822
I mean, I think I know
more about witches

06:04.906 --> 06:06.157
than some witches do.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.076
Wait.
That might sound too cocky.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.703
And insulting.
Does it?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.121
I don't know!

06:12.205 --> 06:13.456
Hey, let me ask you
something.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.457
- Oh, sure. It's not like
I'm the only server

06:14.540 --> 06:16.584
in the middle of
a super-busy restaurant.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.461
- Great, okay, look,
so I've been working on

06:18.544 --> 06:19.879
this Guardian pitch
for Emma.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.672
You know, I'm ready
for my formal training,

06:21.756 --> 06:23.758
but I can't start
without her approval.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.968
So here it goes.
Ahem.

06:26.052 --> 06:26.969
Emma, I--
- Great speech.

06:27.053 --> 06:27.762
She'll love it.
Thanks.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.639
- What--hey!

06:29.722 --> 06:31.766
You know what?
That's actually pretty good.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.810
Wha--Maddie?
Wha...

06:33.893 --> 06:35.603
Can I exchange this
for a different face?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.779
Hey, Em. Do you want
some leftover fries?

06:45.863 --> 06:47.198
Hello?

06:47.281 --> 06:47.615
Earth to Emma!

06:49.659 --> 06:51.285
- Sorry.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.037
- Are you okay?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.705
You seem a little
out of it lately.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.541
- I'm fine.
I've just been

06:56.624 --> 06:57.875
thinking about her a lot
lately.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.961
My mom.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.838
- Oh.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.548
I'm sorry, Em.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.508
I know how much
you miss her.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.386
But...hey, think of
all the positives.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.304
You know, I mean,
you have your dad,

07:10.388 --> 07:13.266
you have Jax,
and, best of all, me!

07:13.349 --> 07:15.351
- [sighs]
And you're all so great.

07:15.434 --> 07:16.686
It just...

07:16.769 --> 07:18.354
It would've been nice
to have someone around

07:18.437 --> 07:19.897
who knows what
I'm going through.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.025
This Chosen One stuff
can get...

07:23.109 --> 07:24.193
heavy.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.862
- Well, that's why
you have a Guardian.

07:25.945 --> 07:26.779
- It's not the same.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.866
- Well,
what if your Guardian

07:29.949 --> 07:32.368
was also your best friend?

07:32.451 --> 07:33.578
'Cause you see,
I've been thinking,

07:33.661 --> 07:35.538
and--and I know so much
about witches--

07:35.621 --> 07:37.707
wait, no, that's not
how I was gonna start it

07:37.790 --> 07:39.542
'cause I--I just think
that sounds a little too cocky,

07:39.625 --> 07:41.878
but anyway, you know,
the Guardian training?

07:41.961 --> 07:44.297
Yeah, me--I just think
it's time, don't you think?

07:44.380 --> 07:47.091
- Especially right now,
with everything going on,

07:47.175 --> 07:49.343
it would have been nice
to have her around.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.596
- Wait, Em, um,
did you hear what I said?

07:51.679 --> 07:52.680
- Guardian training?

07:52.763 --> 07:55.558
Honestly,
it's not a good time.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.436
Like I said,
I got a lot going on.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.104
- But...

08:00.188 --> 08:01.606
You said that,
when the time was right,

08:01.689 --> 08:03.024
you know,
you'd have my back.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.567
And--and the time
just feels so right,

08:04.650 --> 08:05.651
so I thought...

08:05.735 --> 08:07.028
- I said it's not
a good time.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.365
- Dinner's almost ready.

08:11.449 --> 08:15.578
Francisco's famous jalapeño
and bok choy quesadillas.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.079
Will you be joining us,
Andi?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.998
- Jalapeño and bok choy?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.792
You know, I would love to,
but, um...

08:23.502 --> 08:24.545
I was just leaving.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.176
- Dad?
- Oh!

08:30.259 --> 08:32.303
It's "Chef Dad"
right now.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.138
- Do you remember
when this picture was taken?

08:34.222 --> 08:36.765
- Uh, no,

08:36.849 --> 08:37.642
not really.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.104
Shoot.
I forgot the peanut butter.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.606
You know, I'm gonna run
to the store and get some.

08:43.688 --> 08:44.857
- There's no peanut butter

08:44.941 --> 08:46.567
in your jalapeño bok choy
quesadillas.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.945
- I know, but this is a new
recipe that I'm trying out.

08:49.028 --> 08:53.282
It's jalapeño, bok choy,
peanut butter quesadillas.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.992
- Why don't you
ever talk about her?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.285
- Sweetie, I...
- I mean,

08:56.369 --> 08:58.871
this is the only picture
I even have of her.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.122
Don't you have more?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.165
- Well, I--

09:01.249 --> 09:02.875
- You can't possibly
understand

09:02.959 --> 09:04.585
what it's like for me
not to have a mother around.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.003
- Emma!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.380
- Great.
And you don't have anything

09:07.463 --> 09:08.464
to say for yourself?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.465
- I...

09:09.548 --> 09:11.300
- You could at least
make an effort!

09:11.384 --> 09:13.177
[fire alarm beeping]

09:13.261 --> 09:15.096
- Oh! Aah!

09:18.683 --> 09:19.725
- There.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.811
No more reminders of Diego.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.313
[cell phone beeping]

09:24.397 --> 09:26.649
Maddie!
Sophie!

09:28.776 --> 09:30.653
You were supposed to be
watching her!

09:30.736 --> 09:32.488
- The deal was too good
to pass up.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.448
Mint chip
and a toothpick?

09:34.532 --> 09:35.533
I had to take it!

09:35.616 --> 09:36.617
- [scoffs]

09:36.701 --> 09:38.494
- [sighs]
It doesn't matter.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.496
He didn't pick up anyway.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.462
- Look, you need to move on
from Diego.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.381
You need to forget
about how he makes you laugh.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.341
- And how nice
he is to you.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.844
- And how he puts up
with your moods.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.264
- And how protective
he is of you.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.558
- And how cute you two are
together.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.394
Oh, forget it,
you need to go get him back!

10:05.438 --> 10:06.814
- You're right.

10:06.897 --> 10:07.982
I do.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.525
And who cares
what my mother thinks?

10:09.608 --> 10:11.110
- What are you gonna do?

10:11.193 --> 10:12.528
- Well, he's still
mad at me,

10:12.611 --> 10:13.738
so I have to win him back.

10:16.198 --> 10:19.410
Rom-com style.

10:23.664 --> 10:24.832
- Em?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.209
I'm sorry about before,
Em.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.378
The fire alarm went off,
and I was...

10:31.589 --> 10:32.590
Emma?

10:35.384 --> 10:36.719
- Look, Gigi,
are you happy?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.262
I'm taking out the trash,
just like you asked.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.639
- I didn't ask you
to do that.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.723
- Oh, really?
'Cause it's not like

10:40.806 --> 10:42.224
I'm waiting on
all of these tables

10:42.308 --> 10:43.434
by myself and nursing
a broken heart while you...

10:43.517 --> 10:46.228
[muttering]
...all day long!

10:46.312 --> 10:48.064
- You're right.
I'll take it out.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.695
Maddie?
- Gigi?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.280
You're not supposed
to be here!

10:56.364 --> 10:58.407
- What are you do--

10:58.491 --> 11:00.576
[whispering indistinctly]

11:00.659 --> 11:02.161
- This is so cute!

11:04.997 --> 11:06.457
- Come on.
- What?

11:06.540 --> 11:08.417
What?
What are you doing?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.543
- Come on!

11:09.627 --> 11:10.461
- Gigi, I have to work,
what are you doing?

11:10.544 --> 11:12.838
Stop, what are you doing?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.925
[romantic music playing]

11:16.008 --> 11:17.176
What is this?

11:17.259 --> 11:18.677
- This is my apology.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.889
Diego Rueda,
would you...

11:25.851 --> 11:27.019
Would you like to be my date

11:27.103 --> 11:27.812
to the Van Pelt
family reunion?

11:29.188 --> 11:31.023
- No.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.903
I'd love to be
your date.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.785
- Katie!
- Oh, right. Got it.

11:44.370 --> 11:44.829
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.709
- I'm jealous of you, Jax.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.045
- Wait. What?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.422
- Wait,
let me try that again.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.799
I'm happy for you

11:56.882 --> 11:58.426
but upset for myself.

11:58.509 --> 12:02.012
It's hard to describe.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.265
I was watching
you and your mom today,

12:04.348 --> 12:07.351
and I can't help thinking
I wish I had a chance at that.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.686
- Wow...

12:08.769 --> 12:09.895
I'm sorry, Emma.
I...

12:09.979 --> 12:13.149
I wish I had the chance
to give you that.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.484
I would in a second.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.403
Look at the bright side
of things.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.946
You have an amazing parent

12:19.029 --> 12:21.532
who really, really cares
about you.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.874
- Thanks for
meeting me here.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.375
I really need your help,

12:31.459 --> 12:33.335
and it doesn't seem like
anybody else wants to listen.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.087
- I know how that feels.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.338
I mean, I tried
to talk to Emma

12:36.422 --> 12:37.798
to get this whole
Guardian thing going,

12:37.882 --> 12:39.216
and she completely
blew me off!

12:39.300 --> 12:40.259
- It's just that.
I don't understand

12:40.342 --> 12:42.261
why you guys
brought me back here.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.262
- Yeah, and then
she tried to talk me

12:43.345 --> 12:44.430
into this whole
"not the time" bit,

12:44.513 --> 12:45.931
and I'm just like, uh,

12:46.015 --> 12:48.434
"No time like the present time,"
I mean, am I right?

12:48.517 --> 12:49.768
- I was happy where I was.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.897
And now Billy is gone,
Mia hates me,

12:52.980 --> 12:54.273
some other family
probably runs the sanctuary.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.859
[both sighing]

12:56.942 --> 12:57.985
- Good talk.
- Totally.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.446
- So why'd you wanna
meet me here?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.366
- I need you to set up a meeting
between me and the Council.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.161
- Me? Why me?

13:07.244 --> 13:08.954
- Well, Diego's not exactly
the Council's favorite.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.666
And I wanna steer clear
of the whole Maddie situation.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.543
Forget about Emma.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.920
- Oh, uh...

13:16.003 --> 13:18.881
I'm sorry, I just don't know
what I could do for you.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.216
I'm not even a Guardian.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.469
- But you're clever,
and you're resourceful,

13:23.552 --> 13:25.137
and you can pretty much
convince anyone of anything.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.138
- I can, can't I?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.681
- Please.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.600
I'm running out of options.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.311
- You know what?
I'll do it.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.687
Plus, this will show
the Council

13:33.771 --> 13:35.231
that I can take initiative.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.315
You know, I need
to start taking matters

13:36.398 --> 13:39.109
into my own hands.
- Awesome, thanks.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.117
- Ursula.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.245
Magnificent to see you,
my dear.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.913
- Well, the pleasure
is all mine, Roland.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.041
- And where is that
lovely daughter of yours?

13:54.124 --> 13:54.875
Uh, Murgatroyd?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.628
- You know
my Maddie Winky,

13:57.711 --> 14:00.256
she always has to look
just perfect.

14:00.339 --> 14:00.839
She'll be down shortly.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.805
- Mrs. Van Pelt!
We had a deal.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.265
You told us
we didn't have to be

14:09.348 --> 14:10.349
waitresses at the party
as long as--

14:10.432 --> 14:13.394
- As long as you made sure
Maddie was here,

14:13.477 --> 14:14.937
and she is nowhere
to be found.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.022
People are starting
to ask questions.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.567
- There she is!
- Aah!

14:19.650 --> 14:21.151
Aah!

14:21.235 --> 14:24.446
The crab puffs
are fabulous!

14:24.530 --> 14:27.116
- [clears throat]
Hello, Mother.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.577
- What is he doing here?

14:29.660 --> 14:32.580
Maddie, if people find out
who he is,

14:32.663 --> 14:33.664
we're going to be in
serious troub--

14:33.747 --> 14:37.626
Oh, hi, you're back.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.961
- Ah.
Is this Murgatroyd?

14:39.044 --> 14:42.631
I was just asking
your mother about you.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.632
- Um, actually,
it's Maddie.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.052
- What's that horrid smell?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.137
[sniffing]

14:48.220 --> 14:49.597
- Oh, you know what
that must be?

14:49.680 --> 14:52.224
It must be the cheese.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.143
It's, oh, it's--
it's very ripe.

14:54.226 --> 14:58.063
And--and--which means
it's quite fancy.

14:58.147 --> 14:58.772
- No, no.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.650
It smells like onions

15:01.734 --> 15:04.320
mixed with rotten eggs

15:04.403 --> 15:06.155
and--and seaweed.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.657
- Well, seaweed is a delicacy
in some countries.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.701
- You know,
our ancestors

15:10.784 --> 15:14.163
used to say that
the Kanay

15:14.246 --> 15:17.041
smelled of the exact same
combination.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.918
[all laughing]

15:21.462 --> 15:23.505
- Oh, that is
ridiculous!

15:23.589 --> 15:25.924
You know Kanays have been
extinct for years.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.219
Yes, no way
it could be a Kanay.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.763
No, no, no.
No way.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.684
- Maybe this was
a bad idea.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.019
- Maddie...

15:37.102 --> 15:39.521
you have got to get him
out of here.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.398
- If he leaves,

15:41.482 --> 15:43.692
I leave.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.861
- You can't leave.

15:45.944 --> 15:46.028
- Oh?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.449
Well, then I guess
we're staying.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.374
- If you see her,
please have her call me, okay?

15:58.457 --> 15:59.458
[door clicks open and shut]

15:59.541 --> 16:01.251
Wait.
She's walking in.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.545
Thanks again, okay?
Bye.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.255
- Before you say anything,

16:05.339 --> 16:06.799
I just want to tell you
I'm sorry.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.510
- Sorry? You know
how worried I've been?

16:09.593 --> 16:10.636
You missed dinner.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.681
- Dad, I was wrong
to get upset with you.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.432
I just feel...

16:15.516 --> 16:17.226
confused lately.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.560
And it's not your fault.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.480
You've been the best parent
a girl could ask for.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.898
- Here, I--

16:22.981 --> 16:25.693
I dug this up
in my closet.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.194
Come take a look.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.036
I miss her too, Em.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.373
You remind me
so much of her.

16:39.456 --> 16:43.043
- Wow.
She looks so beautiful.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.337
You think I could
keep these?

16:45.421 --> 16:46.839
- Of course.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.758
Hey, if you're hungry, I--

16:49.842 --> 16:52.970
I think I have
a few jalapeños

16:53.053 --> 16:54.513
that are not burnt.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.140
I mean, it's not much
of a meal...

17:06.525 --> 17:07.901
- What you doing?

17:09.069 --> 17:10.612
- Um, ahem,

17:10.695 --> 17:11.946
shouldn't you be in bed?

17:12.030 --> 17:13.240
- Can't sleep.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.700
Were you just playing with

17:14.782 --> 17:17.286
a Captain El Capitan
action figure?

17:17.368 --> 17:18.996
- No!

17:19.079 --> 17:20.329
- No, it's cool.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.125
At home, I have one
that looks exactly like--

17:23.876 --> 17:26.627
- Wait.
This is mine!

17:26.712 --> 17:28.672
- Actually, it's mine.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.549
Or was mine.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.342
- But this one has
the mark on its foot

17:32.426 --> 17:33.969
from when I dropped him
from the roof.

17:34.052 --> 17:35.971
- You did what
to my Captain El Capitan?

17:36.054 --> 17:38.640
- But where
did you find him?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.058
I hid him in
a secret hiding spot only Mom...

17:42.352 --> 17:44.146
Wait, is Mom here?

17:45.397 --> 17:46.148
Ohh, I don't
want to leave!

17:46.231 --> 17:48.400
I really like it here, Jax.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.401
And it's awesome
having Dad around,

17:49.485 --> 17:51.361
and I like hanging out
with you.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.821
Sometimes.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.073
- Well, she's not <i> here</i> here.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.701
But, yes,
I did see her.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.077
And I'll see her again
tomorrow.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.913
Jessie, you should come.
She misses you.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.081
- I'll think about it.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.251
- Ahem.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.211
You forgetting something?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.179
URSULA: Thank you all.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.349
May I have your attention
please?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.851
I am thrilled
to host all of you

18:22.935 --> 18:24.978
at our humble abode

18:25.062 --> 18:29.316
of merely
6,000 square feet

18:29.399 --> 18:31.360
for this special evening.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.028
Tonight...

18:33.111 --> 18:36.657
we select the leader
of the Van Pelt coven

18:36.740 --> 18:40.077
that will take our coven
into the new era!

18:41.787 --> 18:42.746
The votes have been
tallied,

18:42.830 --> 18:46.166
and the results are in.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.294
Underneath that plate
sits the name

18:49.378 --> 18:51.004
of our new leader.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.261
- Oops!
Wrong platter.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.599
- Oh!

19:02.683 --> 19:05.060
Okay.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.897
And the leader

19:08.981 --> 19:11.149
of the prestigious
Van Pelt coven is...

19:12.776 --> 19:15.153
Ursula!
[applause]

19:15.237 --> 19:16.196
- What?
- Ursula?

19:16.280 --> 19:19.658
- I'm Ursula!
I'm Ursula!

19:19.741 --> 19:21.493
I'm Ursula! Aah!

19:22.661 --> 19:24.580
Oh, well, wow.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.415
I--
I guess, since I'm up here,

19:26.498 --> 19:28.792
I--I--I might as well
give a little speech.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.377
Oh, my goodness.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.379
I don't have
anything prepared.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.256
- Oh, my...

19:34.339 --> 19:38.468
- "What It Means To Be
a Van Pelt,"

19:38.552 --> 19:40.804
by Ursula Van Pelt.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.308
V is for--

19:44.391 --> 19:46.393
[slow clapping]

19:48.520 --> 19:50.731
- What it means to be
a Van Pelt

19:50.814 --> 19:52.691
is that you're
a thieving destroyer of lives.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.319
[crowd murmuring]

19:59.448 --> 20:00.365
- You have some nerve

20:00.449 --> 20:03.118
showing your face here,
Jake Novoa!

20:03.201 --> 20:06.622
- You all
tore my family apart.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.457
And I couldn't think
of a better time

20:08.540 --> 20:09.541
to return the favor.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.960
I mean,
the gang's all here, right?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.128
- You wouldn't.

20:13.211 --> 20:16.715
- Please, I'm more powerful
than all of you.

20:16.798 --> 20:17.633
- Mom?

20:17.716 --> 20:21.386
- So!
This is your daughter.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.638
Perfect.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.222
Now, you took
my daughter away.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.683
How about I make yours
disappear?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.685
- No! No!

20:28.769 --> 20:31.480
[rumbling]

20:31.563 --> 20:32.606
- Who did that?

20:32.689 --> 20:34.483
- I did!

20:34.566 --> 20:36.860
- A Kanay?

20:36.944 --> 20:38.820
I knew I smelled
something foul!

20:40.322 --> 20:40.739
WOMAN: Oh!

20:40.822 --> 20:43.700
- [grunts]

20:53.418 --> 20:54.878
[cheers and applause]

20:57.547 --> 20:59.508
- What is everyone
looking at?

20:59.591 --> 21:02.469
[cheers and applause]

21:04.388 --> 21:06.098
- That's Maddie's boyfriend.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.225
- He's my boyfriend!

21:10.435 --> 21:12.062
- I just don't think
she's ready, Mom.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.522
- I'm not surprised.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.899
Jessie's always been
a very strong personality.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.276
But she'll come around;
we just have to keep trying.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.654
- If I can help in any way,
just say the word.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.531
- Emma, you've done enough,
letting us meet here.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.534
I know this won't
bring your mom back,

21:25.617 --> 21:27.577
but if you ever need
a woman's take on things,

21:27.661 --> 21:28.578
you can come to me
anytime you want.

21:28.662 --> 21:32.124
- Thank you,
Miss...Woods, is it?

21:32.207 --> 21:32.708
- Please, call me Liana.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.085
- Liana.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.337
My father actually just found
this old picture of her.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.467
- Oh, she's beautiful.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.677
Looks just like you.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.553
- It's nice to have.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.055
It helps
keep her memory alive.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.141
- If only we could
turn back time, right?

21:49.224 --> 21:50.225
- Mm.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.730
- What if I can?

21:54.813 --> 21:55.981
- What was that, Em?

21:56.064 --> 21:57.441
- What?

21:57.524 --> 21:58.525
Oh, nothing.
