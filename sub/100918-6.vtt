12:22.000 --> 12:23.379
I've never read it before, no.

12:23.413 --> 12:24.000
[chuckles]

12:24.000 --> 12:25.883
[chuckles]

12:25.917 --> 12:26.000
We should download the movie.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.384
We should download the movie.

12:27.384 --> 12:28.000
[Dr. Mid-Nite] Why don't we
just burn this book

12:28.000 --> 12:28.652
[Dr. Mid-Nite] Why don't we
just burn this book

12:28.652 --> 12:29.754
while we're at it?

12:29.787 --> 12:30.000
[Beth]
You're a real riot, Chuck.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.188
[Beth]
You're a real riot, Chuck.

12:31.221 --> 12:32.000
[Dr. Mid-Nite]
I'll be here all week.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.190
[Dr. Mid-Nite]
I'll be here all week.

12:33.222 --> 12:34.000
[Beth] Yay!

12:34.000 --> 12:34.792
[Beth] Yay!

12:34.825 --> 12:36.000
You bought the first edition
off the stands?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.660
You bought the first edition
off the stands?

12:37.695 --> 12:38.000
Wow. You are old.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Wow. You are old.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.831
Wow. You are old.

12:40.865 --> 12:42.000
Okay, okay, not old.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.399
Okay, okay, not old.

12:43.433 --> 12:44.000
Wise.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.436
Wise.

12:45.469 --> 12:46.000
[Courtney] Beth.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.837
[Courtney] Beth.

12:47.871 --> 12:48.000
Oh. Hey there, Stargirl.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Oh. Hey there, Stargirl.

12:50.000 --> 12:50.140
Oh. Hey there, Stargirl.

12:50.173 --> 12:52.000
Hey! Watch the code-names
in public. [chuckles awkwardly]

12:52.000 --> 12:53.177
Hey! Watch the code-names
in public. [chuckles awkwardly]

12:53.211 --> 12:54.000
Don't worry, no one ever
pays any attention

12:54.000 --> 12:55.245
Don't worry, no one ever
pays any attention

12:55.279 --> 12:56.000
to what I'm saying anyway...

12:56.000 --> 12:57.246
to what I'm saying anyway...

12:57.280 --> 12:58.000
Except Chuck.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Except Chuck.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.551
Except Chuck.

13:00.583 --> 13:01.652
Seriously, Court,

13:01.684 --> 13:02.000
thanks so much for these.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.386
thanks so much for these.

13:03.419 --> 13:04.000
Chuck's so cool.

13:04.000 --> 13:04.956
Chuck's so cool.

13:04.989 --> 13:06.000
He makes everything more fun.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.725
He makes everything more fun.

13:07.758 --> 13:08.000
We talk for hours.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.427
We talk for hours.

13:09.461 --> 13:10.000
I've never met anyone who
listened to me...

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I've never met anyone who
listened to me...

13:12.000 --> 13:12.428
I've never met anyone who
listened to me...

13:12.428 --> 13:14.000
until him.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.831
until him.

13:14.865 --> 13:16.000
Um, any JSA business
to talk about?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Um, any JSA business
to talk about?

13:18.000 --> 13:18.668
Um, any JSA business
to talk about?

13:18.702 --> 13:20.000
No. Nothin'. All quiet.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.139
No. Nothin'. All quiet.

13:21.172 --> 13:22.000
I'm just here to study
for that history test.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.374
I'm just here to study
for that history test.

13:23.407 --> 13:24.000
Oh. Good luck.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.506
Oh. Good luck.

13:31.682 --> 13:32.000
[laughs]

13:32.000 --> 13:32.881
[laughs]

13:38.889 --> 13:40.000
Chuck, you are so funny.

13:40.000 --> 13:40.825
Chuck, you are so funny.

13:40.857 --> 13:41.893
[laughs]

13:41.926 --> 13:42.000
You are a real riot.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
You are a real riot.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.096
You are a real riot.

13:45.129 --> 13:46.000
You're like my best friend.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
You're like my best friend.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.178
You're like my best friend.

13:50.902 --> 13:52.000
It got towed here last night.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It got towed here last night.

13:54.000 --> 13:54.504
It got towed here last night.

13:54.538 --> 13:56.000
So?

13:56.000 --> 13:56.539
So?

13:56.573 --> 13:58.000
So you did this, didn't you?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.043
So you did this, didn't you?

13:59.076 --> 14:00.000
With the hourglass.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
With the hourglass.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.812
With the hourglass.

14:02.846 --> 14:04.000
-Why?
-My uncle's a jerk.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
-Why?
-My uncle's a jerk.

14:06.000 --> 14:06.451
-Why?
-My uncle's a jerk.

14:06.484 --> 14:08.000
Your father would never
have used his power like that.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Your father would never
have used his power like that.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.053
Your father would never
have used his power like that.

14:10.087 --> 14:11.121
My father's dead,

14:11.154 --> 14:12.000
so what's it matter
what he would do?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
so what's it matter
what he would do?

14:14.000 --> 14:14.958
so what's it matter
what he would do?

14:14.991 --> 14:16.000
The Injustice Society
killed him

14:16.000 --> 14:17.394
The Injustice Society
killed him

14:17.427 --> 14:18.000
and my mom.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.196
and my mom.

14:19.229 --> 14:20.000
Yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.530
Yeah.

14:20.563 --> 14:22.000
I just found that out.

14:22.000 --> 14:22.466
I just found that out.

14:22.466 --> 14:24.000
Courtney said these people
are still out there.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.335
Courtney said these people
are still out there.

14:24.335 --> 14:26.000
Why haven't you stopped them?

14:26.000 --> 14:26.736
Why haven't you stopped them?

14:26.736 --> 14:28.000
I'm trying to.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.605
I'm trying to.

14:28.639 --> 14:30.000
In fact...

14:30.000 --> 14:31.308
In fact...

14:31.341 --> 14:32.000
I thought you might be able
to help me, Rick.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I thought you might be able
to help me, Rick.

14:34.000 --> 14:34.445
I thought you might be able
to help me, Rick.

14:34.477 --> 14:36.000
With the hourglass?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.914
With the hourglass?

14:37.948 --> 14:38.000
With this.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
With this.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.817
With this.

14:40.850 --> 14:42.000
It belonged to your father.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
It belonged to your father.

14:44.000 --> 14:44.900
It belonged to your father.

14:54.164 --> 14:55.566
-Hi.
-Hey.

14:55.599 --> 14:56.000
Um, hi.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Um, hi.

14:58.000 --> 14:58.469
Um, hi.

14:58.469 --> 14:59.703
We need to talk.

14:59.738 --> 15:00.000
You're giving us our
first mission, aren't you?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.706
You're giving us our
first mission, aren't you?

15:01.740 --> 15:02.000
I can't believe I'm actually
looking forward to this.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I can't believe I'm actually
looking forward to this.

15:04.000 --> 15:04.341
I can't believe I'm actually
looking forward to this.

15:04.375 --> 15:06.000
[Beth] It's scary,
but with Chuck in my ear

15:06.000 --> 15:06.410
[Beth] It's scary,
but with Chuck in my ear

15:06.443 --> 15:08.000
I feel like I can do anything.

15:08.000 --> 15:08.378
I feel like I can do anything.

15:08.412 --> 15:09.546
We can.

15:09.580 --> 15:10.000
Wildcat proved that.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.514
Wildcat proved that.

15:11.548 --> 15:12.000
So what's the plan?

15:12.000 --> 15:12.582
So what's the plan?

15:12.615 --> 15:14.000
Yeah. Tell us "the plan."

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah. Tell us "the plan."

15:16.000 --> 15:16.153
Yeah. Tell us "the plan."

15:16.187 --> 15:18.000
There is no plan.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.523
There is no plan.

15:19.556 --> 15:20.000
-What?
-What?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.505
-What?
-What?

15:26.129 --> 15:28.000
I need all the JSA stuff back.

15:28.000 --> 15:28.432
I need all the JSA stuff back.

15:28.466 --> 15:30.000
The costume,
the goggles, everything.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
The costume,
the goggles, everything.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.466
The costume,
the goggles, everything.

15:33.537 --> 15:34.000
What? Why?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.239
What? Why?

15:35.273 --> 15:36.000
Pat found out I took it
and he's so pissed.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Pat found out I took it
and he's so pissed.

15:38.000 --> 15:38.642
Pat found out I took it
and he's so pissed.

15:38.642 --> 15:39.443
You didn't tell him?

15:39.443 --> 15:40.000
So what? It's not up to Pat.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So what? It's not up to Pat.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.580
So what? It's not up to Pat.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.000
This stuff isn't his
in the first place.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.548
This stuff isn't his
in the first place.

15:44.581 --> 15:45.683
I know, but--

15:45.716 --> 15:46.000
Does this mean I can't hang out
with Chuck anymore?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Does this mean I can't hang out
with Chuck anymore?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.287
Does this mean I can't hang out
with Chuck anymore?

15:49.320 --> 15:50.000
Being Wildcat
is the only good thing

15:50.000 --> 15:51.054
Being Wildcat
is the only good thing

15:51.054 --> 15:52.000
that's happened to me
in forever.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
that's happened to me
in forever.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.292
that's happened to me
in forever.

15:54.325 --> 15:56.000
I'm not giving you back
the suit.

15:56.000 --> 15:56.956
I'm not giving you back
the suit.

16:02.966 --> 16:04.000
Don't make me say
goodbye to Chuck.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Don't make me say
goodbye to Chuck.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.236
Don't make me say
goodbye to Chuck.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.000
We're friends now.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.970
We're friends now.

16:23.855 --> 16:24.000
It doesn't make sense.
Are you sure my dad wrote this?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
It doesn't make sense.
Are you sure my dad wrote this?

16:26.000 --> 16:26.759
It doesn't make sense.
Are you sure my dad wrote this?

16:26.759 --> 16:27.759
[Pat] Why?

16:27.759 --> 16:28.000
He's talking about
growing up in Michigan

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
He's talking about
growing up in Michigan

16:30.000 --> 16:30.260
He's talking about
growing up in Michigan

16:30.293 --> 16:32.000
and meeting my mom
at Calvin College.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.996
and meeting my mom
at Calvin College.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
But my dad grew up
in Connecticut,

16:34.000 --> 16:34.231
But my dad grew up
in Connecticut,

16:34.231 --> 16:36.000
and he met my mom
when they were kids.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.134
and he met my mom
when they were kids.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.000
None of this is right.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.870
None of this is right.

16:39.903 --> 16:40.000
Maybe it's all
some kind of code?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Maybe it's all
some kind of code?

16:42.000 --> 16:42.940
Maybe it's all
some kind of code?

16:42.940 --> 16:43.940
Well, I mean, I thought

16:43.941 --> 16:44.000
the chemical equations
might be.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.375
the chemical equations
might be.

16:45.409 --> 16:46.000
I didn't think
the diary entries were.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I didn't think
the diary entries were.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.313
I didn't think
the diary entries were.

16:49.346 --> 16:50.000
That's good thinking, though.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.149
That's good thinking, though.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.000
I'll keep looking at it.

16:52.000 --> 16:52.750
I'll keep looking at it.

16:52.783 --> 16:54.000
You should leave the journal
with me, Rick.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.719
You should leave the journal
with me, Rick.

16:55.753 --> 16:56.000
You?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.087
You?

16:57.120 --> 16:58.000
This was my dad's.
I'm keeping it.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.524
This was my dad's.
I'm keeping it.

16:59.557 --> 17:00.000
You need to leave it with me.
The hourglass, too.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You need to leave it with me.
The hourglass, too.

17:02.000 --> 17:02.558
You need to leave it with me.
The hourglass, too.

17:02.592 --> 17:04.000
Why?

17:04.000 --> 17:04.663
Why?

17:04.695 --> 17:06.000
Because I don't think you're
ready for it, Rick.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.298
Because I don't think you're
ready for it, Rick.

17:07.332 --> 17:08.000
You don't know me any better
than you knew my dad.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.601
You don't know me any better
than you knew my dad.

17:09.634 --> 17:10.000
I know that he invented
the hourglass.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I know that he invented
the hourglass.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.236
I know that he invented
the hourglass.

17:12.269 --> 17:13.805
The power inside it.

17:13.838 --> 17:14.000
I also know how much
he respected that power.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I also know how much
he respected that power.

17:16.000 --> 17:16.740
I also know how much
he respected that power.

17:16.775 --> 17:18.000
He knew how addictive
that power could be,

17:18.000 --> 17:18.808
He knew how addictive
that power could be,

17:18.843 --> 17:19.910
and how tempting it was

17:19.943 --> 17:20.000
to use it in
all the wrong ways.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
to use it in
all the wrong ways.

17:22.000 --> 17:22.012
to use it in
all the wrong ways.

17:22.046 --> 17:24.000
Limiting the powers
was his idea.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.147
Limiting the powers
was his idea.

17:24.182 --> 17:26.000
One hour a day. And I never
saw him abuse it.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.018
One hour a day. And I never
saw him abuse it.

17:27.050 --> 17:28.000
Not like you have.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.452
Not like you have.

17:28.486 --> 17:30.000
You look at me
