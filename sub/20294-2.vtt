"COPS" IS FILMED ON LOCATION

00:33.633 --> 00:35.467
WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:35.567 --> 00:38.033
ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

00:38.133 --> 00:40.067
IN A COURT OF LAW.

00:42.067 --> 00:43.933
-FORT MYERS,
IT'S A SMALL DEPARTMENT.

00:44.033 --> 00:45.267
AND IT'S VERY CLOSE KNIT.

00:45.367 --> 00:46.700
I JUST WORK
WITH REALLY GOOD PEOPLE.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.567
UM, THE CITY ITSELF,
IT'S A SMALL CITY

00:48.667 --> 00:50.267
INSIDE OF... BIGGER COUNTY.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.333
WE HAVE A LOT
OF HIGH CALL VOLUMES.

00:52.433 --> 00:54.733
AND WE ENCOUNTER
SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS

00:54.833 --> 00:56.267
ON A DAILY BASIS
AND THAT'S WHY

00:56.367 --> 00:57.500
I CHOSE FORT MYERS.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.433
THIS VEHICLE IS TRAVELING
AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED

01:00.533 --> 01:02.200
AND IT FAILED TO STOP
AT THE STOP SIGN

01:02.300 --> 01:03.467
AS IT MADE
A RIGHT HAND TURN.

01:03.567 --> 01:05.800
I'LL CONDUCT A TRAFFIC STOP
ON THE VEHICLE NOW

01:05.900 --> 01:07.467
AND MAKE CONTACT
WITH THE DRIVER.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.533
(police radio chatter)

01:16.433 --> 01:18.067
DR 71.
10-79.

01:18.167 --> 01:19.267
10-79.
DR 71.

01:25.833 --> 01:27.500
HE'S RUNNING EASTBOUND.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.700
RUNNING BEHIND HOUSES
ON BROOKHILL.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.667
WE'RE ON MICHIGAN
RIGHT NOW.

01:41.733 --> 01:44.433
I LOST HIM ABOUT TWO HOUSES
NORTH ON BROOKHILL.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.867
BLACK MALE,
MEDIUM LINKED DREADS

01:46.967 --> 01:48.567
APPROXIMATELY...

01:48.667 --> 01:50.300
SIX FOOT, SIX TWO.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.933
HE'S EITHER LAID
UP BETWEEN THESE HOUSES

01:52.067 --> 01:53.533
OR HE WENT INSIDE A HOUSE.

01:57.567 --> 01:58.767
UM...

01:58.867 --> 02:00.800
HE SAW HIM RIGHT HERE
BEHIND THIS HOUSE.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.567
HE SAW HIM RIGHT HERE,
BEHIND THIS HOUSE RIGHT HERE.

02:02.667 --> 02:05.333
I DON'T KNOW IF HE BAILED
INSIDE THE HOUSE OR WHAT.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.733
-RUNNING THAT WAY?
-YEAH.

02:06.833 --> 02:08.800
WE'RE GONNA ATTEMPT
TO DO A DOG TRACK.

02:11.367 --> 02:13.367
DR 71, WE'RE GONNA TRY
AND REACQUIRE THE SCENT

02:13.467 --> 02:15.233
FROM WHERE
WE LAST SAW HIM.

02:15.333 --> 02:16.633
THE LAST PLACE
WE SAW HIM

02:16.733 --> 02:19.200
WAS ABOUT TWO HOUSES
NORTH FROM MICHIGAN.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.133
IS THAT HIM?

02:24.567 --> 02:26.067
-YOU ALL RIGHT?

02:27.533 --> 02:28.567
HUH?

02:30.533 --> 02:32.733
-DO YOU LIVE HERE?
-YES, SIR. YES, MA'AM.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.267
-WHAT HAPPENED

02:37.067 --> 02:38.167

02:41.200 --> 02:43.067
-FROM OVER THE FENCE?

02:43.167 --> 02:44.700

02:44.800 --> 02:46.500
-YES, SIR.
-WHICH ONE?

02:47.867 --> 02:48.900
-RIGHT THERE.

02:50.733 --> 02:52.067
-PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.233
WHY WERE YOU CLIMBING
OVER THE FENCE FOR?

02:58.333 --> 02:59.767
-BECAUSE THAT RIGHT THERE.

02:59.867 --> 03:01.833
-'CAUSE THE DOG?
-YES, SIR.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.800
-YOU HAVE ANY I.D. ON YOU?

03:05.900 --> 03:07.833
-NOT ON ME RIGHT NOW.
-I'M SORRY.

03:07.933 --> 03:09.567
-DON'T HAVE MINE ON ME.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.067
-WHERE YOUR SHOES?
-GOT DIRT ALL OVER HIM.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.300
-I KNOW.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.567
DO YOU LIVE HERE?

03:13.667 --> 03:15.667
-NO MA'AM.
-NO? WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

03:15.767 --> 03:17.300

03:17.400 --> 03:19.233
-UH-HUH. TRUTH

03:19.333 --> 03:20.900
-WHY I RAN...

03:21.067 --> 03:22.067
FROM YOU-- I'M NOT
EVEN GONNA LIE.

03:22.133 --> 03:23.533
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

03:23.633 --> 03:24.933
BECAUSE I'M WALKING
DOWN THE--

03:25.067 --> 03:26.067
-DR 71, I'LL MEET
YOU OUT THERE.

03:26.167 --> 03:27.967
-I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, MISS.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.067
-WHAT'S THE TRUTH?

03:29.133 --> 03:30.467
-I'M MISSING ON CHECK.

03:30.567 --> 03:31.767
-YOU WEREN'T NEAR A VEHICLE?

03:31.867 --> 03:33.500
-I WAS NOWHERE BY A VEHICLE.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.967
-ALL RIGHT.
GO THAT WAY.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.800
STAND STILL.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.233
HE'S GOT BLOOD ON HIM.
CAREFUL.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.767
-THROUGH THE BACK?

03:44.867 --> 03:46.567
-YOU GOT ANYTHING ON YOU?

03:46.667 --> 03:48.300
ANYTHING ON YOU THAT'S GONNA
STICK ME, HURT ME,

03:48.400 --> 03:49.900
POKE ME,
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

03:50.067 --> 03:51.200
-WELL, I MIGHT--
-SPREAD YOUR FEET.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.800
YOU MIGHT HAVE WHAT?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.067
-LIKE, A LITTLE WEED BAG
THAT I WAS SMOKING.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.100
-A WHAT?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.233
-A LITTLE BAG
I WAS SMOKING, THAT'S IT.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.167
-YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE ON YOU?

04:04.267 --> 04:05.733
NO? ALL RIGHT,
HAVE A SEAT.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.700
I SAW A WHITE VEHICLE TRAVELING
AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.567
IT BLEW STRAIGHT
THROUGH A STOP SIGN.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.733
SO, AS I TRIED
TO APPROACH THE VEHICLE,

04:13.833 --> 04:15.333
TO LIGHT IT UP
TO STOP IT,

04:15.433 --> 04:16.933
UM, IT PULLED UP
IN FRONT OF THIS RESIDENCE,

04:17.067 --> 04:18.367
I LIGHT IT UP,
THE DRIVER BAILED

04:18.467 --> 04:19.400
OUT OF THE VEHICLE.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.967
OUR K-9 RESPONDED

04:21.067 --> 04:22.500
AND THEY HELPED
US LOCATE THE GUY

04:22.600 --> 04:23.767
FOUR OR FIVE
BLOCKS FROM HERE.

04:23.867 --> 04:26.200
HE SPONTANEOUSLY UTTERED,
"DO YOU WANNA KNOW WHY

04:26.300 --> 04:27.867
I WAS RUNNING? I'LL TELL
YOU WHY I WAS RUNNING."

04:27.967 --> 04:29.367
WE FOUND ALL OF THIS
FELONY AMOUNT

04:29.467 --> 04:30.733
OF DRUGS IN THE BACK
OF THE VEHICLE.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.200
AND IN THE VEHICLE,
WE ACTUALLY LOCATED

04:32.300 --> 04:33.533
A CREDIT CARD
WITH HIS NAME ON IT.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.233
HE SAID HE WASN'T
A PART OF THE TRAFFIC STOP,

04:35.333 --> 04:36.700
BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY
TO TALK TO HIM NOW

04:36.800 --> 04:38.367
AND SEE HOW A CREDIT CARD
WITH HIS NAME ON IT

04:38.467 --> 04:40.833
ENDED UP IN THE CAR
IF HE WASN'T IN THE CAR AT ALL.

04:40.933 --> 04:43.433
-ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
NICE JOB.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.633
-SIT UP.

04:44.733 --> 04:47.067

A VEHICLE TONIGHT?

04:47.167 --> 04:49.767
NO? ALL RIGHT, WHERE WERE
YOU BEFORE WE LOCATED YOU?

04:49.867 --> 04:51.433
-I WAS WALKING

04:52.833 --> 04:54.100
-WHAT STREET WERE

04:54.200 --> 04:56.367
-I WAS WALKING

04:56.467 --> 04:58.500
I REALLY CAN'T TELL YOU.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.333
-BROOKHILL? OKAY.
-YES, MA'AM.

05:01.433 --> 05:02.633
I'M WANTED.

05:02.733 --> 05:04.633
-YOU'RE WANTED FOR WHAT?

05:04.733 --> 05:05.767
-VIOLATION OF PROBATION.

05:05.867 --> 05:07.967
I VIOLATED IT LIKE,
TWO MONTHS AGO.

05:08.067 --> 05:09.733
-OKAY.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.067
ALL RIGHT, AND--

05:11.100 --> 05:13.067
-I SEEN Y'ALL SHOOT DOWN--
SOMEBODY SHOT OVER HERE.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.700
-OKAY.
-I JUST SAT RIGHT THERE.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.233
-HEY, WHERE ARE
YOUR SHOES?

05:16.333 --> 05:17.433
-I REALLY COULDN'T
TELL YOU, MA'AM.

05:17.533 --> 05:19.133
-WHEN YOU RAN,
YOU LOST THEM?

05:19.233 --> 05:20.300
-YES, MA'AM.
-ALL RIGHT.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.067
AND YOU CUT YOUR HANDS
WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING?

05:22.133 --> 05:24.233
-YES, MA'AM.
-ALL RIGHT.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.067
AND SO DO YOU LIVE
AT THE HOUSE WHERE WE FOUND YOU?

05:26.100 --> 05:27.233
OR YOU WERE JUST
HIDING FROM US?

05:27.333 --> 05:28.633
-I'M JUST SITTING THERE.

05:28.733 --> 05:29.833
-JUST SITTING THERE?

05:29.933 --> 05:31.500
-I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR Y'ALL TO GO, I WASN'T...

05:31.600 --> 05:33.167
-YOU WERE JUST WAITING
FOR US TO GO BY?

05:33.267 --> 05:34.933
-YES, MA'AM. I WASN'T
TRYING TO HIDE.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.833
THAT'S WHY I WAS JUST
SITTING ON A CHAIR.

05:36.933 --> 05:38.600
-OKAY.
-MY GIRL STAY RIGHT THERE.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.400
IF YOU WANNA GO ASK HER,

05:40.500 --> 05:41.667
-ALL RIGHT. WELL,
WHEN WE FOUND YOU,

05:41.767 --> 05:44.067
YOU SAID, "DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE REASON I RAN?"

05:44.100 --> 05:45.333
SO WHY YOU--
-NO. I DIDN'T SAY DO YOU--

05:45.433 --> 05:47.967

05:48.067 --> 05:49.367
-YEAH. OKAY.

05:49.467 --> 05:50.967
-I'M SORRY, YOU SAID
IT LIKE THAT.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.100
-OKAY, BUT YOU WEREN'T

05:56.200 --> 05:57.267

05:57.367 --> 05:58.733
-NO, MA'AM.
-'CAUSE WE WERE PULLING

05:58.833 --> 06:01.333
A VEHICLE AND A GUY
LOOKING JUST LIKE YOU...

06:01.433 --> 06:03.300
I SAW YOU WITH MY OWN EYES.
-LISTEN, MA'AM,

06:03.400 --> 06:04.967

-YEAH. SURE.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.533
OKAY, I TOLD YOU

I WAS WALKING
DOWN THE ROAD,

06:09.700 --> 06:11.867
GOING TO MY
GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE.

06:11.967 --> 06:12.900
NO VEHICLE.

06:13.067 --> 06:14.367
-OKAY.
-PLEASE STOP BRINGING THAT UP.

06:14.467 --> 06:16.333
-HOW DID YOUR CREDIT CARD
END UP IN THAT CAR?

06:16.433 --> 06:17.867

I DON'T HAVE...

06:36.367 --> 06:37.933

AND HE'S ALSO ADVISING

07:52.467 --> 07:54.167
I DON'T EVEN OWN A GUN.

07:54.267 --> 07:55.733
-ALL RIGHT, WELL JUST

07:55.833 --> 07:57.067
GIVE US JUST

07:57.133 --> 07:59.533
-I WAS GOING TO FEED
MY FRIEND'S DOG.

07:59.633 --> 08:00.933
THAT'S ALL I WAS DOING.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.067
AND HE SHOT AT ME.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.133
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M GETTING TREATED LIKE THIS.

08:05.233 --> 08:06.633
I'M THE ONE THAT
CALLED YOU GUYS.

08:06.733 --> 08:08.267
-OKAY, HANG TIGHT FOR ME.

08:10.133 --> 08:12.067
WHICH GUY WAS THE SHOOTER?
THIS GUY OR THE FIRST ONE?

08:12.133 --> 08:14.400
-THIS GUY WAS THE SHOOTER.
-BECAUSE HE'S THREATENING ME!

08:14.500 --> 08:17.433
-ALL RIGHT, WELL JUST SIT TIGHT
FOR A FEW MINUTES. WE'LL FIGURE
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON, OKAY?

08:17.533 --> 08:19.067
-START STEPPING
BACK TO MY VOICE!

08:19.100 --> 08:20.600
STEP BACK TO MY VOICE!

08:20.700 --> 08:22.400
-I GOT BAD KNEES!

08:22.500 --> 08:24.867
-KEEP COMING...
KEEP STEPPING BACK.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.400
STOP RIGHT THERE.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.633
-WHAT'S LEFT IN THERE, SIR?

08:27.733 --> 08:30.333
-JUST A POODLE.
THERE'S NOBODY IN THERE.

08:30.433 --> 08:32.733
-WHERE'S THE WEAPON?
-HANGING IN THE TRAILER.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.267
-OKAY.

08:34.367 --> 08:35.533
-SHERIFF'S OFFICE!

08:35.633 --> 08:36.833
-COULD BE A DOG
IN THERE, THAT'S IT.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.433
-SHERIFF'S OFFICE!
-MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.233
GO AHEAD,
I GOT YOU COVERED.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.967
CLEAR?
-ALL CLEAR.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.333
-CLEAR.
FIND A GUN YET?

08:49.433 --> 08:51.900
-NO... RIGHT HERE.
-FOUND IT? OH.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.333
WE FOUND THE PISTOL.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.533
SO WE'VE GOT SPENT
CASINGS AND A REVOLVER.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.733
BASICALLY, THE FIRST GUY
THAT WAS WALKING TO US

08:57.833 --> 08:59.367
HE WAS THE VICTIM.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.200
WELL, WE'LL GO
TALK TO HIM REAL QUICK.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.100
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.767
-HIS DOG CAME AFTER ME
AND I SAID,

09:06.867 --> 09:09.167
"YOU BETTER GET THAT DOG
ON A LEASH

09:09.267 --> 09:11.067
OR SOMEBODY'S GONNA
END UP SHOOTING IT."

09:11.167 --> 09:12.533
AND THAT'S WHEN HE FIRED.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.467
-OKAY, SO...
-YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

09:14.567 --> 09:17.067
-RIGHT, HE SHOT AT YOUR...
-HE COULD'VE KILLED SOMEBODY.

09:17.133 --> 09:18.967
-OKAY. AND ABOUT FROM WHERE
WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW,

09:19.067 --> 09:20.633
WHERE DID THAT OCCUR,
WHERE HE FIRED THE SHOT?

09:20.733 --> 09:22.133
-CAN I SHOW YOU?
CAN I GET OUT AND SHOW YOU?

09:22.233 --> 09:24.400
-ACTUALLY, YEAH. GO AHEAD.
-OKAY.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.733
-I WAS GOING TO FEED
MY FRIEND'S DOG.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.300
-DO YOU KNOW HIM AT ALL?
-NO, SIR.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
-DID YOU GUYS ARGUE
AT ALL BEFOREHAND?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.967
-NO, SIR. I DIDN'T
EVEN EXPECT THAT.

09:36.067 --> 09:37.700
THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.267
RIGHT HERE.
-OKAY.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.300
SO YOU WERE COMING THROUGH
RIGHT HERE ON THIS SIDE
OF THE FENCE?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.400
-YEAH. HIS DOG
COME RUNNING UP

09:43.500 --> 09:46.600
AND I SAID, "THAT DOG
BETTER NOT BITE ME,

09:46.700 --> 09:50.333
BLAH BLAH BLAH," AND THEN
HE FIRED AND IT WENT THIS WAY.

09:50.433 --> 09:52.267
-OKAY AND WHERE WERE,
WHERE WERE YOU STANDING?

09:52.367 --> 09:56.067
-I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HERE
AND THE GUN WENT OFF HERE.

09:56.133 --> 09:57.633
-WAS HE SHOOTING AT YOU?
-NO.

09:57.733 --> 09:59.400
HE JUST WANTED TO SCARE ME.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.167
-DID YOU FEAR FOR YOUR LIFE?
-COME ON.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.267
-IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.
DID YOU THINK HE WAS
GONNA SHOOT YOU?

10:04.367 --> 10:07.133
-IF HE WANTED TO KILL ME,
HE WOULD'VE KILLED ME.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.167
-OKAY.

10:08.267 --> 10:09.933
-BUT I'M NOT SCARED
ABOUT NOTHING.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.833
(barking)

10:11.933 --> 10:13.500
-ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S GO
HAVE A SEAT REAL QUICK.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.133
WE'RE GONNA TALK TO HIM
AND STUFF, THEN WE'LL GET

10:15.233 --> 10:17.167
YOU OUT OF HANDCUFFS
AND EVERYTHING, OKAY?
-OKAY.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.433
-I GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT BUT DAMMIT,

10:20.533 --> 10:22.300
I DIDN'T FIRE AT HIM, SIR.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.933
-OKAY, WHY DID
YOU FIRE TOWARDS HIM?

10:24.033 --> 10:26.167
-NO, I DID NOT
FIRE TOWARDS HIM.

10:26.267 --> 10:28.000
-OKAY, WELL...
-I GOT WITNESS TO IT ALL.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.767
-WHY DID YOU DISCHARGE
YOUR WEAPON THEN?

10:29.867 --> 10:31.667
-THAT'S A MISTAKE
I MADE, SIR.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.500
-OKAY.
-OKAY?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.633
THAT'S... THAT'S A
MISTAKE I MADE.

10:35.733 --> 10:38.067
-DID YOU FEAR FOR YOUR SAFETY?
-YES, I SURE DID.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.767
BECAUSE HE'S YOUNGER
THAN I-- I'M 75.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.033
I JUST GOT THROUGH
WITH RADIATION OF CANCER.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.733
-WHY DID YOU FEAR
FOR YOUR SAFETY?

10:44.833 --> 10:46.400
-BECAUSE HE'S THREATENING ME!

10:46.500 --> 10:47.933
-OKAY.
-AND MY DOG!

10:48.033 --> 10:50.000
-WHAT WAS THE SPECIFIC
NATURE OF HIS THREATS?

10:50.100 --> 10:54.533
-HE-- HE SAYS, "I'M GONNA
SHOOT YOU AND THAT (bleep) DOG

10:54.633 --> 10:56.300
THAT'S OFF A LEASH."

10:56.400 --> 10:58.700
-OKAY. IS THAT WHEN
YOU DREW YOUR WEAPON AND FIRED?

10:58.800 --> 11:00.900
-NO. I DIDN'T HAVE THE WEAPON.
-OKAY.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.767
SO YOU WENT BACK
INTO THE TRAILER
AND GRABBED THE WEAPON?

11:02.867 --> 11:04.633
-LET HIM KNOW I HAD A WEAPON.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.200
AND THEN HE STILL KEPT AT ME.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.800
-DID YOU SEE A GUN
ON HIM AT ALL?

11:07.900 --> 11:10.067
-NO. BUT HOW DO I KNOW?
I MEAN...

11:10.100 --> 11:11.567
(whistles) WE'RE IN WITTMANN.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.200
(laughs)

11:13.300 --> 11:15.500
-SIT TIGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES,
WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON, OKAY?

11:15.600 --> 11:18.067
LET'S JUST GO TALK
TO THE OTHER WITNESS NOW.

11:18.167 --> 11:19.333
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT?

11:19.433 --> 11:21.333
-I WAS WALKING
AND I HEARD THAT GUY THERE

11:21.433 --> 11:24.367
THREATEN TO SHOOT HIM
AND HIS DOG.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.233
SO WAYNE SHOT
TOWARDS THE GROUND.

11:26.333 --> 11:29.100
-WHEN YOU SAY-- WHEN YOU SAY
HE THREATENED, HOW DID
HE SAY THE THREAT?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.233
-HE SAYS, "I'LL SHOOT
YOU AND THAT DOG."

11:31.333 --> 11:33.933
-OKAY, WAS THE DOG...
NEAR HIM?

11:34.067 --> 11:35.167
-NOT THAT I COULD SEE.

11:35.267 --> 11:36.767
-OKAY.
-I THINK PEBBLES HAD ALREADY

11:36.867 --> 11:38.633
WENT INTO THE TRAILER
BY THAT POINT.

11:38.733 --> 11:41.133
BUT SEE, I COULD HEAR
HIM SAYING IT AS I'M WALKING

11:41.233 --> 11:45.200
DOWN THE ALLEY.
BUT THEN I SEEN HIM COMING
TOWARDS WAYNE.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.967
-OKAY.
-AND WAYNE SHOT
TOWARDS THE GROUND.

11:47.067 --> 11:49.400
-NOW DID WAYNE-- DID IT
LOOK LIKE WAYNE WAS...

11:49.500 --> 11:50.867
IN DISTRESS AT ALL LIKE
THE GUY WAS GONNA

11:50.967 --> 11:52.267
COME AT HIM OR ANYTHING?
DID WAYNE---
-YES.

11:52.367 --> 11:54.100
HE WAS YELLING AT HIM
AND WAYNE SAID,

11:54.200 --> 11:56.467
"DON'T YOU THREATEN ME
AND MY DOG. I HAVE A WEAPON."

11:56.567 --> 11:58.300
AND HE SH-- FIRED IT.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.100
AND HE-- AND I SEEN THE DUST.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.700
-OKAY.
-AND IT WAS NOWHERE
AROUND THAT MAN.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.833
IT WAS COMPLETELY
AWAY FROM HIM.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.833
-OKAY AND AFTER THE SHOT...
-AND THEN HE'S SITTING THERE--

12:06.933 --> 12:08.833
THE MAN'S SITTING THERE
CUSSIN' WAYNE UP AND DOWN,

12:08.933 --> 12:10.900
LEFT AND RIGHT.
-AFTER THE SHOT OR BEFORE?

12:11.067 --> 12:12.500
-BEFORE AND AFTER.
-OKAY.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.200
SO AFTER THE SHOT,
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

12:14.300 --> 12:17.333
-THE GUY KEPT SAYING,
"YOU STUPID..." YEAH, YOU KNOW.

12:17.433 --> 12:20.733
"(bleep),
BLAH BLAH, BLAH BLAH."

12:20.833 --> 12:22.367
-OKAY. OKAY.
-"BLAH BLAH." OKAY.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.933
-JUST BE PATIENT AND JUST WAIT
A FEW MORE MINUTES, OKAY?

12:25.067 --> 12:26.900
JUST WATCH YOUR LEG.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.700
-CAN I HAVE A WINDOW DOWN?
-WINDOW'S DOWN.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.633
-HAHA! LET ME OUT.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.600
-YEAH...
-IS SHE READY TO GO?

12:32.700 --> 12:35.267
-JUST RELEASE 'EM.
LET 'EM START WALKING AWAY.

12:35.367 --> 12:37.567
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR US AT ALL?

12:37.667 --> 12:38.667
-I'M PISSED.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.267
-OKAY. I WOULD BE, TOO.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.500
-WELL, I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER CALLED YOU GUYS

12:42.600 --> 12:45.467
'CAUSE I SHOULD HAVE JUST
TOOK MATTERS IN MY OWN HANDS.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.267
-WELL, THEN YOU'D PROBABLY
BE GOING TO JAIL TOO.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.500
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.467
-NEXT TIME A MAN PULLS
A GUN AND SHOOTS AT MY HEAD,

12:51.567 --> 12:54.233
YOU WON'T FIND ME.
AND YOU WON'T FIND HIM.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.067
THIS IS THAT LAST TIME
I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THIS CRAP.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.567
-OKAY.
-YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:59.667 --> 13:01.133
THE WEST IS DONE.

13:02.767 --> 13:05.500
-OUR VICTIM HERE OBVIOUSLY
HAD BEEN DRINKING.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.500
BUT OUR SUSPECT WENT INSIDE,
GOT A FIREARM

13:08.600 --> 13:09.800
AND THEN RE-APPROACHED THE GUY.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.633
KIND OF CHANGES
A LITTLE BIT TO NOW

13:11.733 --> 13:13.067
INSTEAD OF "I'M JUST
DEFENDING MYSELF" TO

13:13.133 --> 13:15.500
"THIS GUY'S PISSING ME OFF,
I'M GONNA CHALLENGE HIM."

13:15.600 --> 13:17.800
IT DOESN'T MEET STATUTE
FOR SELF DEFENSE.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.867
SO I GUESS THE WIFE IS GONNA
GO AHEAD AND SECURE THE TRAILER

13:19.967 --> 13:22.267
AND LEAVE FOR THE NIGHT
WITH HER HUSBAND GOES TO JAIL.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.133
-ONE OF THE THINGS
I REALLY LIKE TO DO

13:25.233 --> 13:27.133
IS I WORK ON MY CAR
IN MY OFF TIME.

13:27.233 --> 13:29.067
I HAVE A MUSTANG
THAT I BUILD,

13:29.133 --> 13:31.300
A 2003 MUSTANG COBRA.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.700
IT'S BASICALLY MY BABY.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.300
I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
AND, UH, IT WAS MY DREAM CAR,

13:35.400 --> 13:36.533
SO I BOUGHT IT.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.333
I TAKE IT OUT TO THE TRACK
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

13:38.433 --> 13:40.500
AND GO RACING. THAT'S WHAT
I DO ON MY WEEKENDS OFF.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.067
WE'RE HEADING TO A CALL
OF A MALE AND FEMALE

13:45.100 --> 13:47.433
SLEEPING BEHIND A BUILDING WHERE
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.500
LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE HERE...

13:55.200 --> 13:56.367
THREE, CALL THREE.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.400
-HEY. HEY.
-SOMEONE'S HERE.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.800
-I THINK HE'S DEAD.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.600
-SIT. HEY, COME
BACK OVER HERE.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.433
-MY BOYFRIEND--
-I KNOW, STAY OUT OF THE CAR.

14:07.533 --> 14:10.133
-GET OVER HERE.
-MY DOOR...

14:11.333 --> 14:13.467
-Woman: I AM. I'M RIGHT HERE,
I'M RIGHT HERE.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.133
-BABY!
-WELL, HIS EYES ARE MOVING.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.733
-Woman: HE LOOKS LIKE HIS EYES
ARE... I DON'T KNOW.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.067
-I DON'T KNOW, WE GOT
IN A FIGHT OVER AN HOUR AGO

14:21.133 --> 14:23.067
AND HE TOOK OFF.
HE WAS JUST--

14:23.100 --> 14:25.600
-CALL THREE, GET ME FIRE RESCUE
OVER HERE, PLEASE.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.067
-BABY!

14:27.100 --> 14:29.600
JEFF! JEFF!

14:31.367 --> 14:33.367
-HE'S GOT A PULSE, RELAX.
-HE'S STILL BREATHING.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.333
-YEAH, HE'S BREATHING.
HE'S GOT A PULSE.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.300
-(crying)

14:39.867 --> 14:42.100
-B-- BACK AWAY FROM HIM.
BACK AWAY.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.967
GO SIT-- GO SIT
OVER BY THE CAR.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.233
JUST RELAX FOR A MINUTE.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.133
-WE WERE TOGETHER...
I WAS WORKING ALL DAY.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.633
AND THEN I PICKED HIM UP--
-DID HE TAKE ANYTHING TODAY?

14:50.733 --> 14:52.833
-I...
-DOES HE DO DRUGS, MA'AM?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.533
BE HONEST WITH ME.
-YES, HE DOES.

14:54.633 --> 14:56.833
-WHAT DOES HE DO?
-HE SHOOTS UP.

14:56.933 --> 14:58.067
ALL KINDS OF PILLS.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.233
-WHAT'S HIS NAME?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.833
-JEFF!
-JEFF.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.067
YOU HEAR ME, BUDDY?
JEFF, YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.400
-MM-HMM.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.500
-BABY.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.833
-DO YOU HAVE HIS I.D.?
AND YOUR I.D.?

15:08.933 --> 15:10.167
-I DON'T KNOW WHERE
ANY OF HIS STUFF IS.

15:10.267 --> 15:13.100
IT'S PROBABLY IN THE BOX...

15:13.200 --> 15:14.867
-Jeff: (mumbling)

15:14.967 --> 15:16.067
-BABY.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.933
-WERE YOU GUYS DRIVING
IN THIS CAR?

15:18.067 --> 15:19.900
-I WAS DRIVING,
HE WAS WALKING.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.267
WE GOT IN A FIGHT
AT THE HOSPITAL

15:21.367 --> 15:23.367
OVER THREE HOURS AGO
AND I WAS TRYING TO FIND HIM

15:23.467 --> 15:25.067
AND I JUST...
-OKAY. IS THAT HIS WALLET?

15:25.167 --> 15:26.800
-FOUND HIM RIGHT THERE.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.900
-DO YOU HAVE YOUR LICENSE?
-IT'S IN THE CAR.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.067
THIS IS HIS.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.367
-Woman: I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND LEAVE, OFFICER.

15:33.467 --> 15:34.400
-YEP, YOU'RE GOOD.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.667
STAY OUT OF THE CAR
FOR A SECOND.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.867
I'LL GO OVER THERE
WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

15:37.967 --> 15:39.900
-I'M GONNA LEAVE.
-YEP. YOU'RE GOOD.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.400
YES MA'AM.
YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.200
STAY OVER HERE.
STOP WALKING AROUND.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.367
ARE YOU-- DO YOU DO DRUGS, TOO?
-YEAH, SHE'S ON DRUGS.

15:45.467 --> 15:47.733
-OH HUSH.
-YEAH... HEY,
CAN YOU STAY WITH HIM?

15:47.833 --> 15:50.700
HE WAS JUST INCOHERENT,

16:02.067 --> 16:04.133
