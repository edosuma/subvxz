WEBVTT

00:05.756 --> 00:06.714
No!

00:06.882 --> 00:07.924
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:08.092 --> 00:09.884
We're not police.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.219
You're gonna die
if you stay in there!

00:11.387 --> 00:12.720
Cruz!
I'm coming in!

00:13.847 --> 00:16.349
Leon!

00:16.517 --> 00:17.684
Leon!

00:18.811 --> 00:20.770
Help me. Help me.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.022
Please!

00:24.983 --> 00:26.901
Those are old.
I'm out.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.028
What do you mean?
I mean I'm out.

00:32.783 --> 00:33.825
Hi, Mom.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.827
So you're still
defending her?

00:35.994 --> 00:37.161
I'm not gonna turn
my back on her.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.580
Don't you miss dad?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.541
You think if I asked him
to my cousin's
Christmas party,

00:41.709 --> 00:42.667
he might take it
the wrong way?

00:42.835 --> 00:43.751
Shouldn't you be
asking Casey?

00:43.919 --> 00:45.503
Saturday.
What are you doing?

00:46.004 --> 00:49.090
Are we just here as friends,
or is this a date? Ss

00:52.052 --> 00:53.594
Well, I was
right about Casey.

00:53.762 --> 00:54.846
He's still into Hallie.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.877
Shay?

01:30.299 --> 01:34.886
Shay.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.263
Hey.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.975
Shay, sweetie.
Sweetie.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.311
Hey.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.647
Shay, Shay.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.194
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.919
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.007
You look good,
you really do.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.760
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.222
How's Hallie?

02:20.849 --> 02:22.517
We broke up.
Oh.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.728
But you were together
for, what, four years?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.064
Eight.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.234
Well, I never liked her.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.740
Do you, uh,
do you talk
to your sister?

02:40.786 --> 02:41.994
Not really.

02:43.163 --> 02:47.041
Well, the reason
I'm asking is
my hearing's coming up...

02:47.209 --> 02:49.752
I know.
And I thought
maybe this time...

02:50.170 --> 02:53.256
I've been thinking about
this a lot, Matthew...

02:53.757 --> 02:55.508
You could talk to her.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.138
It's still hard for her.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.808
It's hard for her?

03:07.646 --> 03:10.773
Look, I need to turn
the page on this too,
you know?

03:11.567 --> 03:14.569
When am I gonna
be allowed to do that,
stuck in here?

03:15.487 --> 03:18.948
Maybe you should've
thought of that before
you killed Dad.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.917
Mom...

03:34.131 --> 03:38.467
All keys, cell phones,
any metal objects must be
placed in the basket.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.727
BP's 180 over 100.
Pulse of 56.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.395
Respirations of ten
and irregular.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.981
Her pupils are unequal,
but she responded
to light on scene.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.983
Is she allergic
to any medication?
No.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.484
Gabriela.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.613
You okay?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.948
We're going to need
a blood test, stat.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.707
She's gonna be fine.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.628
Yeah.
Gonna get you
looked at, okay?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.796
Get you cleaned up.
Come on.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.925
It's okay.
Go ahead.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.764
Is that her?
Is that Shay?
Let them do their job.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.141
Kelly. Kelly!
I want to see her.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.935
Right now,
there's nothing
you can do.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.523
What are they...
What are they talking here?
She's got a head injury?

04:34.691 --> 04:35.733
How bad is it?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.319
I don't know.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.343
What have you heard?
Moderate traumatic
brain injury.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.761
And they've located
the brain swelling,

05:03.929 --> 05:05.012
so they're gonna
do an MRI,

05:05.180 --> 05:06.722
try to determine the
extent of the damage.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.684
If anybody can find a way
to rally, it's Shay.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.602
And Dawson's
all right?

05:11.770 --> 05:13.312
She has
a laceration on her leg,

05:13.480 --> 05:14.647
but other than that,
she's fine.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.400
They're gonna release
her here in a minute.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.527
The other driver,

05:19.695 --> 05:20.987
this tow truck,
was he DUI?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.656
No. Breathalyzer
came up negative.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.409
Stupid freak thing.
Truck blew a tire.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.868
What about
Shay's family?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.954
Mom's in Tacoma.
Dad's in Baton Rouge.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.331
I left a message
for them both.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.959
Every thought,
every prayer

05:35.127 --> 05:36.919
needs to be directed
down that hallway.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.672
All right?

05:50.058 --> 05:52.685
This house needs
a run, big-time.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.355
Hey, Dawson.
Hey, Dawson.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.606
Hey.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.028
Shay?

06:02.946 --> 06:04.238
Uh, she's still in ICU

06:04.406 --> 06:06.365
but the brain swelling
subsided,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.951
and she won't need surgery
or the ICP catheter.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.661
They're hoping
she's out of the woods.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.080
Just spoke
with Chief Hatcher.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.834
In the absence of Shay,
candidate Peter Mills

06:17.002 --> 06:20.880
will fill in the vacated post
in an EMT capacity.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.048
For how long?

06:22.549 --> 06:23.674
Till Shay's back
in this house.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.056
Hey, hey.
Finally some
good news.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.099
Listen to this.
That fire on
North Hamlin,

06:32.267 --> 06:33.309
guess who
the body was.

06:33.935 --> 06:39.732
"The Chicago medical examiner
identified it to be that
of Manuel "Flaco" Rodriguez,

06:39.900 --> 06:42.526
"purported leader
of the street gang,
Insane Kings,

06:42.694 --> 06:44.820
"wanted for
a string of unsolved
West Side murders,

06:44.988 --> 06:46.822
"said a CPD
spokesman."

06:46.990 --> 06:49.825
So long, Flaco.
God has spoken.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.369
I don't throw
the word "karma"
around a lot,

06:52.537 --> 06:55.831
but that's exactly
what that is, my friends,
with a capital "K."

06:57.918 --> 06:59.460
Your brother can
breathe easy, Cruz.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.422
So can you.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.885
Well, you got that right.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.098
Hey, Dawson. Hey.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.060
What else did
the doctors say?
Uh, it's a head injury.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.645
They're hoping to get
a better indication

07:17.813 --> 07:20.231
of where she's at
in the next 24.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.274
Hey, she looked
a little better.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.235
You saw her?
Yeah.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.402
They told me
no visitors.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.074
I wasn't a visitor.
I was getting
examined myself.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.411
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.123
How are you doing?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.625
Great, thanks.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.631
The thing is, me and Shay
had a disagreement right
before she went on shift.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.592
Yeah, I know.
She asked if she could stay
at my place for a while.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.177
Yeah.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.848
But in light of things,
I think she should
come back home

07:54.015 --> 07:56.851
after she's discharged.
I'll take care of her.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.561
I mean,
that's her call to make.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.438
But I'm not really worried
about that right now.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.276
Of course. Yeah.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.903
I just want her
to be okay.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.822
Yeah, me too.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.453
Yo.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.373
What are you doing,
waving that thing
around in here?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.459
Yo, did you read this?
Yes.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.419
I thought you
would have been
doing cartwheels.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.838
Yo, when nobody saw him
come out that blaze,

09:08.006 --> 09:09.757
there was crazy stories
flying everywhere,

09:09.925 --> 09:12.218
like he was hiding
out somewhere.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.802
This confirms it, bro.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.346
Flaco's dead.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.890
I know, Leon.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.819
You did this for me.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.409
That's why
you've been acting all
shook lately, huh?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.472
Yo, we take this
to the grave,
just me and you.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.642
Thank you.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.644
Thank you!

10:04.938 --> 10:06.647
Me salvaste la vida.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.776
So quit trippin', bro.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.369
This wedding
job I booked,

10:20.537 --> 10:23.205
the father of
the bride and I,
we hit it off.

10:23.373 --> 10:27.001
Anyway, he's the CFO of this
sewage treatment plant.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.004
Really?
You're into sewage now?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.255
No.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.425
Anyway, he turns out,
he's a family guy.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.634
A really good guy.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.555
He has some venture capital
that's burning
a hole in his pocket,

10:39.723 --> 10:42.141
says he might be
willing to invest
some start-up cash

10:42.309 --> 10:43.684
in a fleet of limos.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.230
What's the catch?
None.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.401
The only hitch is that
I invited him here
to the firehouse today

10:52.569 --> 10:53.485
to hash things out.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.446
But with everything
going on...

10:55.613 --> 10:57.656
If Shay gets wind that
you screwed up this
business opportunity

10:57.824 --> 10:59.616
'cause of her,
she will kick you
in your nuts.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.660
Yeah, but...

11:01.828 --> 11:03.620
Go ahead,
take the meeting.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.914
We need to get back
to normal around here.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.667
I appreciate it, Chief.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.465
No catch, huh?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.844
Not unless
he tries paying me
with Monopoly money.

11:22.098 --> 11:26.393
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61, woman trapped
from unknown cause.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.564
The ground just collapsed.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.691
Okay. Get back.
Get back.

11:33.902 --> 11:34.943
We got a sinkhole.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.696
Guys, get these
cars moved in case of
a secondary collapse.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.865
I tried to get close,
but the ground
started to pour in.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.076
She your neighbor?
Our mail lady.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.745
Help me,
please hurry!

11:44.913 --> 11:46.288
Somebody, help me!
Help me, please.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.707
Lieutenant Kelly Severide,
Chicago Fire Department.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.084
We're gonna work on
getting you out.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.835
What's your name?
Sylvia.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.128
I need to get out of here.

11:53.296 --> 11:56.298
It's getting
hard to breathe.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.300
Hey, air struts
and shoring, right now.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.885
Call the Chief.
Got it, Lieutenant.

12:03.807 --> 12:04.807
Please help me!

12:05.517 --> 12:06.975
Is that all we got?
That's it.

12:09.646 --> 12:10.646
That won't be enough.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.984
Get me more boards!
Grab anything you can get.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.945
Please help me.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.834
Hey!

12:32.001 --> 12:33.752
Sorry, ma'am.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.302
Come on.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.975
Hey, Sylvia, put these on
to protect your eyes.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.769
Up on green.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.062
That's in!

12:52.230 --> 12:53.689
Okay. Go ahead down,
check the shoring.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.822
All right, Chief,
good to go.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.579
I can't breathe.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.706
Brought something for you.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.458
I can't feel anything.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.834
Here, put this on.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.504
- Deep breaths, Sylvia.
- Here you go.

13:17.672 --> 13:18.881
Here's the line,
Lieutenant!

13:25.722 --> 13:26.722
Come on.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.766
Good.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.768
All right,
get her out of here.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.229
Pull her out.
Pull her out now.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.779
Let's get out of here!

13:43.239 --> 13:44.406
Oh!

13:44.866 --> 13:46.158
- Let's move.
- Pull her in!

13:48.536 --> 13:49.953
I got her.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.956
Oh!

13:56.711 --> 13:57.711
Thank you.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.755
All right.
Way to go.

13:59.923 --> 14:00.923
Good job.

14:09.265 --> 14:13.602
Eye, motor, verbal responses
have improved steadily
in the last two hours.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.439
We still have to
monitor her closely,
see how she progresses.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.152
Hey.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.322
Hey. You're working?

14:25.990 --> 14:29.868
Well, you know,
with you faking it,
someone's got to step up.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.331
How you feeling?

14:35.333 --> 14:37.626
Uh, a little beat up,
but I'm all right.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.045
Be a little while
before I see
the ambo, I guess.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.259
You really
scared me, girl.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.718
Don't do it again, okay?

14:49.138 --> 14:52.140
So you were telling me,
last thing I remember,
about your date with Casey.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.851
It didn't go so well
or something.
Oh, no. Geez.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.980
The date was a disaster.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.191
And Casey kissed me
on the cheek.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.484
Oh...

15:04.070 --> 15:05.320
Listen...

15:06.114 --> 15:08.282
It's not too late
to switch teams.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.867
You already moved in.
Let's take it slow.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.248
Hey.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.085
Oh.
You're up.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.796
Yeah.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.840
Hi.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.384
They're so beautiful.
Thank you.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.520
Be good to get you home.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.898
The place feels
really empty without
hipster music

15:42.066 --> 15:43.900
blasting from your room.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.824
I'm still gonna stay
with Dawson, Kelly.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.952
I think the way
we left it is best.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.916
Let me know
if you hear
anymore updates.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.086
Are you high?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.590
What?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.801
You've got pinpoint pupils.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.554
Are you out
of your mind?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.390
You didn't answer
the question.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.686
I'm worried about Shay.
Is that okay with you?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.825
Herrmann, relax.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.120
I can't, okay?
I got a lot riding on this.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.623
Me and Cindy,
we just need five grand more
to make the down payment,

16:39.791 --> 16:43.543
so we can move the hell out.
I thought you got along
with your father-in-law.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.546
You want to drastically
alter your relationship
with your father-in-law?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.840
Move in with him.
Used to be that
I was a fireman hero.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.510
Now he treats me like
I'm Mr. Frickin' Belvedere.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.553
You're putting too much
pressure on yourself.

16:53.721 --> 16:57.724
Herrmann, there's
a Lance Ebbott
out front for you.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.017
He's punctual.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.609
Mr. Ebbott.
Lance, please.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.486
Lance,
good to see you.
You too.

17:09.654 --> 17:12.072
Fantastic wedding
the other day.
Oh, well, thank you.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.950
Your daughter
looked lovely.
So did your wife.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.369
Not that I was
staring or anything.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.287
You're very kind to say so.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.040
So uh, I looked it over,
or rather,
my business manager did

17:22.208 --> 17:24.042
and it looks good.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.877
Just one last step,
and then I'm in.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.463
Take me for a ride
after your shift.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.589
Show me how
the business operates,

17:29.757 --> 17:31.883
or more importantly,
how you operate.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.345
Relationships, trust, loyalty,
that's what's important to me.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.681
As it is with me, sir.
Lance.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.099
Lance.
See you at 7:00?

17:39.267 --> 17:42.185
Yes, sir. See you...
Lance, see you at 7:00.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.105
Yeah.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.959
Can I help you
with something?

18:06.419 --> 18:07.419
What?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.464
Can I help you
with something?
This is private property.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.343
Where am I?
What is this place?

18:16.179 --> 18:17.304
Gary.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.806
Gary?
Yes, sir.

18:21.893 --> 18:22.934
Indiana?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.986
Hey.
Hey.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.366
So Shay's good, huh?
Well...

18:38.868 --> 18:42.037
She still has some
recovery left to go, but...

18:42.205 --> 18:43.288
We definitely got lucky.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.248
What about you?

18:46.876 --> 18:48.418
Should probably have
taken a couple days off.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.796
Right,
like you would have?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.716
Listen, uh,

18:56.761 --> 18:58.595
at the Christmas party...

19:00.014 --> 19:02.891
If I seemed distracted,
it's because...

19:04.769 --> 19:06.144
I guess I was.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.817
There's some stuff
I'm dealing with,
stuff I gotta figure out.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.030
Well, you know
you can talk to me
anytime you want, right?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.909
About any of that stuff.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.999
Ambulance 61.
Difficulty breathing.
800 East Cottage Grove.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.251
I hope it works out...

19:30.086 --> 19:31.795
Whatever it is.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.674
If we set
a shift record for calls,
it's on you, you know.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.677
So you setting me up to
be the firehouse jinx?
I'm just saying I'm counting.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.222
I'm not one to shy away
from labeling folks.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.525
CFD. Anybody there?

19:54.569 --> 19:57.445
Whoa, there is a woman
on the floor in there.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.534
All right, we got
to get in. Break it.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.743
All right.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.878
All right.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.722
Okay, good, good...
Good poochie.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.479
Wait! Wait!

20:35.109 --> 20:36.484
Oh, man.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.197
That woman is in bad shape.
We need to get back out there.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.868
This is Ambulance 61.
We need a company
for manpower and CPD.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.037
Copy that, 61.
Sending backup.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.914
Here, take this
out of the wrapper.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.792
What?

21:03.054 --> 21:04.220
Okay.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.224
Here goes.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.706
It smells nice.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.167
It's, like,
a vanilla candle
or something.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.504
Uh, that...
That's my body lotion.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.554
Yeah, we're good.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.938
You got her ID,
medical info?
Yes. We are all good.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.773
Just don't miss
any turns on the way
to the ER.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.358
Ha. Funny.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.529
This thing always catches.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.365
You should look into
getting it fixed.

22:05.533 --> 22:09.160
Yeah. Unfortunately,
Jim's dangerous with tools.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.080
If only I knew
a contractor.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.002
Thanks for having me.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.045
I wanted to talk
to you about something.

22:20.715 --> 22:21.923
Let me guess.
Just...

22:22.925 --> 22:26.052
Wondering if maybe
you'd be willing to
dial it back this time.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.347
This coming
from you or her?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.057
From me.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.560
She'd be on parole.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.603
There would still be
restrictions in place.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.773
She could've asked for help.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.694
She could've moved
far away from him.
But she didn't.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.530
She killed him.
Yes, I realize
that, Christie.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.198
I was there.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.285
You were
in a campus dorm on the
other side of the country.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.537
I heard all
the things he said.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.706
I saw him belittle her...

22:55.750 --> 22:56.916
Break her.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.212
She paid the price.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.007
Listen,
15 years ago,

23:05.092 --> 23:07.510
I'm not having
this conversation.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.347
But now I am.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.644
Nothing excuses
what she did.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.148
I'm not asking
you to forget.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.241
Um...

23:32.620 --> 23:34.037
Damn, I'm glad
you're back in town.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.830
Yeah, me too.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.415
I was in Madrid.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.668
How often do you
have to go there?

23:42.046 --> 23:44.422
This was for
an interview, actually.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.008
For a, um, promotion.

23:48.511 --> 23:49.886
You taking it?

23:53.682 --> 23:54.808
I am.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.102
When?

23:59.772 --> 24:02.023
They need me there
next week.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.068
Ah.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.240
You know, it's funny,
'cause we've only
dated a couple times,

24:10.407 --> 24:11.866
but it just...

24:12.451 --> 24:14.744
Feels like longer,
doesn't it?

24:15.913 --> 24:16.788
Yeah.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.920
My stomach's been
in knots just thinking
about telling you.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.934
Do you get
any vacation time?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.770
A little, here and there.

24:40.938 --> 24:44.399
So then, would you
think about coming
out to visit me?

24:45.734 --> 24:46.860
Yeah.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.200
Now my stomach's
back in knots again.

24:56.871 --> 24:57.745
Hey.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.456
Congrats.
Seriously.

25:01.292 --> 25:05.128
And, yes, I will come
visit you when I can.

25:05.713 --> 25:06.754
You will?

25:08.465 --> 25:11.509
So then, should I
pop open a bottle of
champagne to celebrate?

25:11.677 --> 25:13.052
Absolutely.
Yeah?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.345
Yeah.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.767
Okay.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.954
Hey, hey,
where you going...
Get back here.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.206
Where you going?

25:42.917 --> 25:46.002
He's going away.
Yeah, aw.

25:47.671 --> 25:48.796
This is good.
This is good.
You good?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.674
Great.
This is great.
So really great.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.593
So what I'm thinking
is that, once a week

25:53.761 --> 25:55.428
or every two weeks,
we go on a run, you know?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.680
We, uh,
we meet new clients,
we drum up new business,

25:57.848 --> 25:59.599
and that'll be
our cover story.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.643
And then we, you know,
have a good time.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.604
Sounds good to me.
Good.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.481
So, uh, give me,
like, ten minutes...
Uh-huh.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.775
And then we'll be
out of here, all right?

26:52.486 --> 26:53.736
My family had
a German Shepherd.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.363
They're great dogs.
I'm not scared of them.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.615
Please, please.
You screamed like a girl.
I am a girl.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.450
What's your excuse?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.828
Hey, Cruz, you okay?

27:02.955 --> 27:03.871
Yeah.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.832
You sure? You look like
you're gonna throw up.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.711
She literally almost
hit the ceiling
when the dog lunged at us.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.546
Oh, yeah?
Yes.

27:11.714 --> 27:12.630
He jumped higher
than I did.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.716
No, I jumped higher
to make myself bigger.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.551
Like, when you encounter
a grizzly bear in the wild,

27:16.719 --> 27:18.428
you... You...

27:18.595 --> 27:20.430
That survival tip
doesn't even
make any sense.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.931
All you're doing is,
you're standing there,

27:22.099 --> 27:25.059
making yourself
a bigger serving size for
the bear or whatever.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.853
Where I'm from,
you haul your ass
out of there.

27:27.021 --> 27:28.896
Oh, really?

27:33.777 --> 27:34.777
Hey, Cruz.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.613
Lieutenant, I have
to talk to you
about something.

27:38.824 --> 27:39.699
Okay.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.792
My brother Leon,

27:50.753 --> 27:52.628
he might be a screw-up,

27:52.796 --> 27:54.589
but he's got a really
good heart, you know?

27:54.757 --> 27:56.841
Yeah, of course.
And these...

27:57.009 --> 28:00.136
These scumbags,
the Insane Kings, you know,
he's nothing like 'em.

28:00.304 --> 28:01.971
But they got
their hooks in him,

28:02.139 --> 28:04.223
and they weren't
gonna let him go.

28:04.641 --> 28:05.600
And when I...

28:05.768 --> 28:08.770
When I was in that building,
I was checking floors.

28:09.563 --> 28:12.690
And there he was, you know,
Flaco. He was...
Let me stop you right there.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.694
If you're about to say
what I think you are,

28:16.862 --> 28:19.405
then you and me can
walk right out this door,

28:19.573 --> 28:21.699
down to the police station.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.746
The second option is,

28:27.414 --> 28:29.791
you sleep on this
one more time.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.837
Think about why you did it
or didn't do it,

28:36.215 --> 28:39.801
'cause at this point,
I have no idea 'cause
you've told me nothing.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.514
Sure as hell sounds
like your brother got
a new lease on life.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.686
Next shift,
come to me.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.775
And either
we go to the cops,

28:56.652 --> 28:59.612
or you shake my hand
and say, "Good morning,"

28:59.780 --> 29:02.031
and we go about
our business.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.742
Understand?

29:08.914 --> 29:10.331
I understand.

29:25.931 --> 29:29.058
I really appreciate it.
We'll speak soon.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.769
Okay. Bye.
Who was that?

29:31.937 --> 29:34.730
The business manager
for that investor guy.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.026
He's in.
You're kidding me.
How much?

29:39.194 --> 29:41.279
Full boat. 30 grand.

29:41.738 --> 29:45.491
Dude.
Let the ink dry first.
Let the ink dry first.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.618
These things have
a way of going south.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.829
He already wired
the money into
my bank account.

29:50.873 --> 29:53.541
Well, egg on my face.
Congrats.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.585
You and Cindy can
get that house now.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.795
Looks like it.
Hey, go on.
Show 'em.

29:57.963 --> 30:01.924
Nice little two-storey
over in the west loop.
Go ahead, show them.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.843
Oh, man, Herrmann,
congratulations.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.511
Wow. That's awesome.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.555
Cindy's gonna flip.
Yep.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.313
Tray?

30:27.034 --> 30:28.701
You got a sec?

30:44.843 --> 30:45.968
Um...

30:50.015 --> 30:51.516
I need help.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.105
You got it.

31:01.527 --> 31:05.530
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Battalion 25, Ambulance 61.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.074
Traffic accident, University
Village Marketplace...

31:21.964 --> 31:23.965
He drove right through...
Through everything.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.883
He hit that child.
Didn't even stop.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.843
Get him
out of there. Come on.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.762
Crowd control,
before they kill that man.

31:29.930 --> 31:32.306
Severide, get your men
on that storefront glass.

31:32.474 --> 31:33.808
Hadley,
Capp, let's go.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.519
Stand back, please!
Back off!

31:36.979 --> 31:38.062
Back off, please!

31:38.230 --> 31:39.772
Sir, you okay?

31:44.528 --> 31:47.363
All right, boys.
Glass is cleared.
Treat the victim.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.699
Hang on.
Sit down, right here.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.576
Get back. Come on.

31:52.661 --> 31:55.371
It was a shortcut.
It's the way I always go.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.915
I didn't see 'em.
Okay.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.166
I didn't see 'em.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.168
How much did you have
to drink today, sir?

32:01.336 --> 32:02.587
I think a bottle.
A bottle?

32:03.046 --> 32:04.422
That man is drunk
off his ass. Look!

32:04.590 --> 32:06.549
Stand back
and let the paramedics
do their job.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.926
Stay still.
Come on, stay still.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.136
Severe ataxia.

32:10.721 --> 32:11.971
What did you
have to drink
in that bottle, sir?

32:13.140 --> 32:15.099
Since we were been
playing football
all day at school...

32:15.267 --> 32:17.268
Playing football at school?
You taking us down
memory lane?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.646
The coach said
drink a lot of water,
keep up your energy.

32:20.814 --> 32:22.023
What's the score?

32:22.858 --> 32:24.275
We'll need
a sobriety test
from the drunk.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.860
I cannot
believe this, man.

32:26.028 --> 32:27.069
Hey, hey.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.741
You smell anything
on his breath?
No, nothing.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.743
All right, sir,
open your eyes
wide for me

32:33.910 --> 32:35.870
and track
my finger, okay?

32:36.038 --> 32:37.747
Nothing
but a drunk!

32:37.914 --> 32:39.415
He's not drunk.
He's having a stroke.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.751
What? Are you sure?
I mean, he's not slurring.

32:41.918 --> 32:42.877
There's no signs
of partial paralysis.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.962
It could be at the base
of his brain stem.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.922
We got to get him
to the hospital, right now.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.758
Let's kill him!

32:48.925 --> 32:51.385
Back her up.
What are you
helping him for?

32:51.553 --> 32:53.012
Why should we move?

32:55.390 --> 32:56.807
Because he needs treatment.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.143
All right,
everybody, back now!

32:59.561 --> 33:00.895
We're not going anywhere.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.564
Back up,
or I'll knock you
on your ass.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.660
Pass me an I.V. Sir?

33:16.244 --> 33:18.245
What?
I need your help.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.830
We're short on
medics right now.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.415
You're crazy, man.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.835
Hold this I.V. Bag
high in the air to start
the flow of saline.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.547
We use it
to help the victims.
You sure?

33:28.715 --> 33:29.924
Man, give me this.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.551
Like this?

33:34.971 --> 33:36.013
Perfect.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.099
All right, back up.
Let's give him some room.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.892
Yeah, give me
some room, people.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.894
Back up
for the medics.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.397
You heard the man,
back up for the medics.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.857
Nice.
Learned that one
from you.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.528
Seriously?
I'm a paramedic.

33:50.696 --> 33:54.782
You're a patient.
Wheelchair to the door.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.242
Hardass.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.371
Take care of yourself.
Yeah, you too.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.002
What's going on?

34:08.296 --> 34:10.047
We have a great plan.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.723
It was gonna be
Sound of Music,
but my mom is saying

34:18.890 --> 34:21.058
the kids are
too young for Nazis.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.478
I don't care if
they watch Scarface.
They're occupied,

34:24.646 --> 34:26.480
and we're celebrating.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.444
You ready?
Christopher, honey?

34:34.573 --> 34:35.906
Oh, no.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.451
Did the money
not go through?
No.

34:40.287 --> 34:42.830
It went through.
What's the matter?

34:44.666 --> 34:45.875
This guy...

34:49.880 --> 34:51.922
He's not my kind
of guy, Cindy.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.811
Then we'll give
the money back.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.313
Then there's no house.

35:07.481 --> 35:10.816
Or I got to find
another schmo
to invest 30 grand.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.109
Let's rent.

35:14.821 --> 35:19.742
I love you so much
for working your ass off
to get us a house again,

35:19.910 --> 35:21.952
but we just want you home.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.665
Margie, from school,

35:27.334 --> 35:30.002
they're gonna have
a vacancy in their
complex next week.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.881
We'll make it
our dream home.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.598
You're my girl.
You know that?

35:49.689 --> 35:51.732
Well, I made it for Shay,
but she canceled.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.484
So I figured,
why let it go to waste?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.194
Oh, wow.
And you're the
only friend I have

35:55.362 --> 35:57.863
who'd appreciate
the work that went
into this meal.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.199
Oh, so this is where
the magic happens.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.409
You know it.
All right.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.206
Juniper-braised
short ribs.
Oh.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.503
And roasted asparagus.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.214
Damn.

36:15.382 --> 36:16.799
The only thing
I didn't make was dessert.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.926
Oh, hey, well,
I'll whip something up.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.053
Can you make something
to follow this meal?

36:21.721 --> 36:23.889
Okay, let's not get
too cocky, now.

36:24.057 --> 36:26.517
Oh, well,
it ain't being cocky
if you can back it up.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.979
Oh, didn't Peter Mills
just say that
not too long ago?

36:30.146 --> 36:33.816
Damn straight I did,
but you watch and learn.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.860
Okay?
Okay.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.004
Hi, Matt.
Hey.

36:55.797 --> 36:56.755
Come on in.

36:56.923 --> 37:00.676
I just wanted
to talk to you about
the mom thing first.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.052
Okay.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.602
I realize that one
of our problems is
we don't talk.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.688
And I wanted
to tell you,

37:13.732 --> 37:15.524
whether or not you're
speaking up against mom
at the hearing...

37:15.692 --> 37:17.109
I will be.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.322
Then so am I.

37:23.158 --> 37:26.368
And I'm going to argue that
she should be paroled.

37:27.829 --> 37:31.081
And I respect you
and where you're
coming from,

37:31.249 --> 37:33.834
and I hope you can
do the same with me.

37:37.881 --> 37:38.797
Can you wait here
for a sec?

37:40.216 --> 37:41.342
Yeah.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.057
Violet's school picture.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.019
I was going to give it
to you after dinner.

38:01.696 --> 38:05.324
"An epic arctic hurricane,
all-time low king crab supply,

38:05.492 --> 38:07.493
"and two mutinies
aboard ship."

38:07.661 --> 38:09.620
Awesome.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.872
See, this is why
we're best friends.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.208
Kendra, sweet as she is,

38:14.376 --> 38:16.585
she gets me
Pride and Prejudice.
Nah.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.546
Yeah. I mean,
get to know me already.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.131
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk...

38:21.299 --> 38:22.424
What?

38:22.842 --> 38:24.885
And mint chocolate
chip ice cream?

38:25.053 --> 38:27.846
I mean, what are we
talking about here?

38:28.515 --> 38:29.848
Welcome home.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.981
You know I'm gonna be
with you every step of
the way, right, Kelly?

38:41.945 --> 38:43.278
I'm meeting with
the surgeon next week.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.950
They say they can get
the whole procedure
on the books soon after.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.453
And I got to get
Boden involved.

38:55.959 --> 38:57.251
And...

39:00.005 --> 39:01.130
The painkillers...

39:02.757 --> 39:04.758
I'm gonna go cold turkey.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.095
But if I feel like
I'm gonna slip on
a banana peel,

39:08.263 --> 39:12.850
the union has an employee
assistance program
for substance abuse.

39:15.145 --> 39:17.021
Dawson looked into it.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.485
I am so damn
proud of you, Kelly.

39:26.239 --> 39:29.742
And if I were straight,
I'd throw the biggest hump
into you right now.

39:36.750 --> 39:39.626
I really don't know
what I would've done
if anything happened to you.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.593
I felt the exact same way.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.142
All right.
All right, all right.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.061
All right.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.689
I feel like
going to med school's

40:00.857 --> 40:02.691
a way to push myself
further, you know?

40:02.859 --> 40:04.818
Yeah.
Take it up a notch.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.197
But that's all on hold
until my finances improve.

40:08.615 --> 40:12.785
See, you did take it up
a notch today on shift,
calling out that stroke.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.996
I mean,
you take it up every day
right where you are, so...

40:16.664 --> 40:18.540
I don't know.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.504
It's funny, though,
the things that you
keep in your head

40:23.671 --> 40:25.297
and the things you forget.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.341
Like what?

40:28.968 --> 40:30.969
Don't laugh.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.181
Sometimes I have
a hard time remembering
all the bones in the body...

40:34.349 --> 40:35.849
Basic EMT.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.018
I don't think I could
name them all either.

40:38.186 --> 40:41.647
You don't have an excuse.
It should be fresh in
your mind, Peter Mills.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.025
Well, let's find out.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.862
Like, what is that?

40:49.948 --> 40:51.406
Uh, radius.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.827
And that?
Ulna.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.954
Right?
UI... Ulna.
Good.

41:01.876 --> 41:02.876
What is that?

41:05.004 --> 41:06.046
Sternum.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.050
It's actually more the...

41:10.718 --> 41:12.094
Costal margin.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.560
What about this?
