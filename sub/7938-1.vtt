<i>Rocks for my pillow
and sand for my bed</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:51.900
<i>For better or for worse

00:51.950 --> 00:54.730

<i>Ain't it lonesome ain't it sad</i>

01:04.379 --> 01:06.780
<i>I was the only happiness
he ever had</i>

01:06.830 --> 01:09.445

Here it is - Las vegas.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.810
Fastest growing city in America.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.740
We have Brooklyn Bridge,
Venice Canal, Eiffel Tower.

02:31.790 --> 02:33.610
Everything you want, we have.

02:33.660 --> 02:37.460
We have five restaurants right here
in hotel open 24 hours.

02:38.460 --> 02:42.300
No night, no day. Just fun
and frolic. World of dreams.

02:42.350 --> 02:46.140
Anything you need,
you ask for me.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.010
My name is Vladimir.

02:48.060 --> 02:51.860
I can-do guy. No problem too small,
no problem too big.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.260
Okay, great. Thank you.

02:55.020 --> 02:58.820
Uh, good. Very good.
Thank you very much.

03:02.460 --> 03:05.340
Oh. Hold on.
Hey. Sorry.

03:05.390 --> 03:09.140
Oh.

03:10.260 --> 03:14.060
Thank you very much, sir.
Enjoy your stay. You too.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.540
It's okay, right?
It's what you wanted?

03:29.700 --> 03:31.940
Right. Okay.

03:40.260 --> 03:44.060
It's okay. You don't have to close that one
'cause you can lock it from the other side.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.860
Hey, I see you
in here having coffee every morning.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.380
I'm Richard. Hi, Richard.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.170
- You are?
- Florence.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.089
Florence what?
Just Florence.

04:22.140 --> 04:25.940
- Well, "just Florence", what do you do?
- I make a lot of noise.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.300
Oh? I play drums.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.730
In a band?
Mm-Hmm.

04:30.780 --> 04:33.610
So, you have a CD out?
No.

04:33.660 --> 04:36.490
We're just kind of putting
one together right now.

04:36.540 --> 04:40.380
You know, when you're finished,
you should get your mp3 files together.

04:40.430 --> 04:42.250
Hold on.

04:42.300 --> 04:45.130
You should get
your mp3 files together.

04:45.180 --> 04:49.020
It's a great way for new bands to get
heard. We already thought about that.

04:49.070 --> 04:51.900
So, you make a living
playing the drums?

04:52.180 --> 04:55.980
No. No. Not even close.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.530
What do you do?
I'm a stripper.

04:59.580 --> 05:02.460
Really? God,
you don't look like a stripper.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.290
No?
Mm-Mm.

05:05.340 --> 05:07.260
What do strippers look like?

05:07.310 --> 05:09.180
I don't know.

05:09.460 --> 05:13.260
I mean, they don't look like you.

05:18.140 --> 05:21.900
Where do you perform?
Pandora's box.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.700
I'll see you around.

05:36.260 --> 05:40.060
Have you ever been here before?
No. Have you?

05:40.220 --> 05:42.260
No.

05:45.060 --> 05:48.860
You wanna go out
and take a look around?

05:50.780 --> 05:54.580
Yeah, okay. Yeah,
really? Okay.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.380
Smile. Smile.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.580
Shoot. Okay. Uh, okay.

06:35.630 --> 06:37.500
I didn't cock it.

06:39.740 --> 06:41.700
Did it flash?

07:35.100 --> 07:38.900
Whoo!

08:49.980 --> 08:53.780
I said, no touching.

08:58.620 --> 09:02.460
So, is it weird just being all alone
in front of your computer all day?

09:02.510 --> 09:04.330
I'm not
- No.

09:04.380 --> 09:07.260
Well, the thing about computers is that you're
kind of connected to everybody and everything.

09:07.310 --> 09:11.060
It's like you're
at the center of the world.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.900
Do you miss your computers yet?

09:16.060 --> 09:18.140
Well, I have it with me.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.620
Man! Let's go.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.820
Wanna go?

09:30.300 --> 09:32.220
Yeah? All right.

09:32.270 --> 09:34.140
Okay, come on.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.340
Whoo.

10:00.060 --> 10:03.860
Aah.

10:21.180 --> 10:24.010
So they're all still back in Ohio?
Yeah.

10:24.060 --> 10:26.940
Everyone except for my sister.
She lives in Santa Rosa.

10:26.990 --> 10:29.260
She's married.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.610
What's her name?

10:33.660 --> 10:37.100
Um, Val.
Does she have kids?

10:37.150 --> 10:40.540
Yeah. A little girl, Megan.

10:42.460 --> 10:46.260
She was born with a wandering eye.

10:46.420 --> 10:50.220
They did all these operations when she was
a kid. She wears these really thick glasses.

10:53.060 --> 10:55.140
She's very pretty.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.780
My dad just died.

11:09.180 --> 11:11.380
Prostate cancer.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.180
Oh, I am so sorry.
It's okay.

11:17.820 --> 11:20.700
Were you guys really close?

11:20.750 --> 11:22.860
Yeah.

11:23.860 --> 11:27.660
He was a great guy. Sweet.

11:28.540 --> 11:32.340
I come from a very tight family,
very Midwestern.

12:19.580 --> 12:23.340
You look good.

12:47.420 --> 12:51.180
What do you want me to do, baby?

12:52.260 --> 12:56.060
What are the options?

12:57.660 --> 12:59.900
The regular routine.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.740
Sure.

13:09.420 --> 13:13.220
Lap dance - two songs, $60.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.890
I can't go to Vegas with you.
I mean, I gotta work.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.580
Thanks, though. I know you're
working. I know you have to work.

13:41.660 --> 13:45.460
Um, so I can compensate you.

13:45.660 --> 13:48.540
Sorry. I don't do things like that.
What kind of things?

13:48.590 --> 13:50.410
You don't go on,
like, a vacation?

13:50.460 --> 13:53.290
No. I don't have sex
with people for money.

13:53.340 --> 13:57.340
Why do you have to
talk like that?

13:58.140 --> 14:01.020
Richard, there are lots
of other women...

14:01.070 --> 14:04.820
Who would love to do that with you.

14:14.460 --> 14:18.250
What if I paid you, like, $ 10,000?

14:18.300 --> 14:20.170
Jesus Christ! You got a lot
of money to throw around.

14:20.220 --> 14:23.580
Yeah, I made a lot of money
last year - over a million dollars.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.940
- Everyone's a millionaire these days.
- I've worked so hard.

14:26.990 --> 14:30.780
I just- I wanna have fun,
I wanna celebrate.

14:30.830 --> 14:33.610
You know? I'm not a bad guy.

14:33.660 --> 14:37.460
What are you talking about exactly?
Nonstop sex 24 hours a day?

14:38.460 --> 14:42.260
Well, not like nonstop sex,
necessarily.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.660
I just wanna get to know you better.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.010
Oh, you wanna get to know me better.

14:48.060 --> 14:51.860
And I'm not talking about marriage.
It's just the weekend.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.540
All right, let's talk about this.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.500
I'm not saying that I-
- I would... do it, but-

15:05.340 --> 15:08.220
I mean, if I was gonna do it,
there'd be a lot of conditions.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.660
Okay.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.860
Um, no talk about feelings.

15:16.910 --> 15:19.690
Mmm.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.820
No kissing on the mouth.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.370
No penetration.

15:27.420 --> 15:30.260
What do you mean, no penetration?

15:30.340 --> 15:33.940
I mean, no fucking.

15:34.140 --> 15:37.930
Okay, I can live with that.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.850
It's all an act. You know that, right?

15:39.900 --> 15:43.700
And you'll
pay me cash, up front.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.370
Hey.

16:39.420 --> 16:41.940
Oh, hey. How's it going?

16:43.260 --> 16:45.460
Oh, really?

16:46.140 --> 16:48.970
Um, let me just think for a sec.

16:49.020 --> 16:52.860
Um, why don't you start off
by putting like-

16:52.910 --> 16:55.740
Just put 60 back into the fund.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.685
Uh-Huh.

16:57.735 --> 16:59.530
Um-

16:59.580 --> 17:01.940
Sell it at 55.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.339
All right.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.099
I mean, when was the last time you got
laid? Since you broke up with Debbie?

17:11.150 --> 17:14.890
That's fucking two years ago,
dude. You need to get on something.

17:14.940 --> 17:17.819
Man, I don't know what happened to you.
Last year, you were a fucking genius.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.650
King came up with the best concept of the year

17:20.700 --> 17:24.500
Well, it's- Now you can't
even get out of bed?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.369
But you gotta go all the way.

17:27.420 --> 17:31.210
You took your fuckin' 90%
and now you're checkin' out.

17:31.260 --> 17:34.140
You own 18% of this company.
Do you know how much money that is?

17:34.190 --> 17:37.020
That's not courtside seats.
That's buying the fucking N.B.A. team.

17:37.070 --> 17:38.890
And you're sittin' home jerkin' off,
watchin' porn?

17:38.940 --> 17:42.740
Dude, I got a hundred engineers at
M.I.T. who'd take your place in a minute.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.620
Go get one. Yeah, right.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.860
Not so fast.

21:48.540 --> 21:52.340
We got until 2:00.

21:52.500 --> 21:56.300
You're right. I don't wanna rush it.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.450
<i>Here's where we goof the map,</i>

24:13.500 --> 24:17.300
<i>Out past the power lines,
up that little sideroad without a sign,</i>

24:18.300 --> 24:20.170
<i>Hidden from the main street.</i>

24:20.220 --> 24:23.100
<i>The keepers of the ancient future,
the keepers of the drama.</i>

24:23.150 --> 24:25.020
<i>They don't preserve it.</i>

24:25.070 --> 24:28.820
<i>They live it.</i>

26:30.780 --> 26:32.700
Hey.

26:32.820 --> 26:35.060
Hey. I'll be right there.

26:56.860 --> 27:00.660
So you don't seem to be too unhappy,
then. Why would I be unhappy?

27:00.780 --> 27:04.580
I don't know. You were pretty
reluctant to get into all this.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.180
Well, it's not every day a girl
gets to eat oysters...

27:09.230 --> 27:13.020
In a suite in Vegas with Dick Longman.

27:13.070 --> 27:15.900
You have no regrets, then?

27:15.950 --> 27:18.220
Don't be silly.

27:19.740 --> 27:23.540
I'm having a fine time.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.900
Me too.

27:43.740 --> 27:46.620
Do you have a secret fantasy?

27:48.540 --> 27:50.460
Uh, not really.

27:50.510 --> 27:53.290
Come on.

27:53.340 --> 27:57.130
Come on. Everybody has a secret fantasy.

27:57.180 --> 28:01.020
Uh, three days in Vegas
with a beautiful woman.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.890
That's it?
Yeah.

28:02.940 --> 28:06.740
There's nothing that you always
wanted but you never asked for?

28:09.660 --> 28:11.860
Tell me.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.260
Really?
Yeah.

28:28.860 --> 28:32.660
Really. The chinese call that "fire and ice. "

28:33.660 --> 28:36.820
No! There's a name for it?

28:44.220 --> 28:46.500
That's cold.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.980
Oh, my God.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.060
Oooh!

29:25.500 --> 29:29.300
Aaah!

29:30.300 --> 29:32.220
Aah!

29:41.820 --> 29:44.700
Do you want me to stop?

29:44.750 --> 29:46.570
I'm okay.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.540
No, stop, stop, stop, stop.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.820
Six days away from the I.P.O.,
okay? Mm-Hmm.

31:17.870 --> 31:20.650
You gotta keep it together. I know.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.570
This is what we talked about a year ago.
You're a rock star.

31:22.620 --> 31:26.420
You raised this money. You had the best
"B" to "B" concept in the world. All right?

31:27.420 --> 31:29.290
Okay. This is serious cash.

31:29.340 --> 31:32.220
Right. Don't burn yourself out
on quake and playing stocks.

31:32.270 --> 31:34.140
Okay. I need you to be
together for Tuesday.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.010
Okay. Come in early.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.900
How early?
Like before lunch.

31:39.950 --> 31:41.980
Thank you.

32:04.860 --> 32:08.660
Florence, you up?

32:10.620 --> 32:13.020
Good morning.

32:13.070 --> 32:15.370
Good afternoon.

32:15.420 --> 32:18.300
Why? What time is it?

32:18.350 --> 32:20.170
1:30.

32:20.220 --> 32:24.020
I ordered up some coffee. You want some?

32:25.020 --> 32:27.850
Um, yeah.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.740
Just - just give me five minutes, okay?

32:31.790 --> 32:34.570
Okay.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.460
I worked parttime at Wal-Mart.

32:38.510 --> 32:40.330
Went to college.

32:40.380 --> 32:42.300
Mm. What'd you study?
Quantum physics.

32:42.350 --> 32:45.130
Wow. Really?
Yeah.

32:45.180 --> 32:49.020
You know, black holes and big bangs.

32:49.070 --> 32:51.850
Yeah, I know. Seriously?
No.

32:51.900 --> 32:55.720
Come on. What'd you really study?

32:55.770 --> 32:59.540
Doesn't matter. I didn't finish.

33:00.540 --> 33:03.420
- You know what I studied?
- What?

33:03.470 --> 33:06.300
Computer science.
Really?

33:06.350 --> 33:08.460
No.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.860
I did work as a locksmith...

33:23.580 --> 33:27.370
When I first came to L.A.

33:27.420 --> 33:31.220
What do you mean, cutting keys and installing
locks? I was a locked car specialist.

33:32.220 --> 33:35.100
Can't you just use a coat hanger for that?
Yeah, you can.

33:35.150 --> 33:36.970
But only if the car was built before 1982.

33:37.020 --> 33:40.820
Some of these new lock systems are so complicated
I had to take a special training course.

33:42.780 --> 33:46.620
They have all these tools,
like the swan key. It's like a bird.

33:46.670 --> 33:49.500
That's a pretty strange job
for a girl, isn't it?

33:49.550 --> 33:52.330
Actually, it's mostly women that do it.

33:52.380 --> 33:55.260
I mean, the company likes to hire women
because they don't panic the way men do.

33:55.310 --> 33:58.090
They can handle the pressure.
What pressure?

33:58.140 --> 34:01.020
Think about it. No,
usually there's nobody in the car.

34:01.070 --> 34:03.850
But sometimes people get locked
in their cars,

34:03.900 --> 34:07.740
And people get really freaked out
when they're locked in a small space.

34:07.790 --> 34:11.540
Okay, but can't you just
open the lock from the inside?

34:13.500 --> 34:17.300
Well, what about a dog?
Can a dog unlock a door?

34:19.260 --> 34:23.100
One time I had to get
this poodle out of a Mercedes.

34:23.150 --> 34:26.889
And it was during this heat
wave a couple years ago.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.820
And this woman kept screaming
at me that Winston was gonna die.

34:29.870 --> 34:32.650
The dog's name was Winston Churchill.

34:32.699 --> 34:35.530
It was a really tricky lock,
and I was working on it.

34:35.580 --> 34:39.380
And she - She kept grabbing on to
my arm and telling me to hurry up.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.739
I wanted to punch her.

34:51.100 --> 34:54.860
One time... I arrived
at this car early in the morning,

34:56.699 --> 34:59.020
And there was a man trapped inside-

34:59.180 --> 35:01.820
An old man.

35:02.460 --> 35:06.260
He'd been in there all night.
He had Alzheimer's.

35:07.260 --> 35:10.090
He thought it was Chicago
and it was 1932. God.

35:10.140 --> 35:13.940
When I finally got him out, he was so
dehydrated he had to drink six glasses of water.

35:17.820 --> 35:21.620
The scariest one
- There was this time I was driving...

35:22.620 --> 35:25.450
Home, actually.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.300
I don't think I was working. And I came
across this accident that had just happened.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.220
There was nobody there.

35:32.270 --> 35:35.050
So I called 911,

35:35.100 --> 35:37.930
And I went over to the car wreck...

35:37.980 --> 35:41.770
And there was this woman
trapped in the car.

35:41.820 --> 35:45.160
But I didn't wanna leave her in the car,
you know. She was unconscious.

35:45.210 --> 35:48.500
I couldn't tell... if she was really
badly hurt or what was going on.

35:49.500 --> 35:53.300
And I started to work on the lock
to try and get her out.

35:54.300 --> 35:58.100
It was just her and I, and I kept
looking at her through the glass thinking,

35:59.100 --> 36:02.900
I could save her life.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.610
You have the bad gun again.

36:09.660 --> 36:12.490
Just keep moving. No.
Keep going. Okay. Okay.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.420
Don't back away. But if you die,
aren't you just dead?

36:15.470 --> 36:18.250
I mean, how can you keep going
if you can die?

36:18.300 --> 36:20.700
Just try and pick up
that big gun because-

36:20.750 --> 36:23.845
- I didn't know that.
- You've got it again.

36:23.895 --> 36:26.890
But I didn't pick it up.
It just - Aaah!

36:26.940 --> 36:29.770
Oh, my God! I killed him!
No, that was you.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.650
No, no, no, I was doing so good.
Hold on, hold on.

36:32.700 --> 36:36.540
You were doing okay. You're pretty good,
actually. Seriously, you're pretty good.

36:36.590 --> 36:39.420
No, I know. I'm really good. No,
for a beginner you're pretty good.

36:39.470 --> 36:43.210
For like the first time - here,
you should let me help you.

36:43.260 --> 36:45.180
You should let me help you.
You should let me help you. No. No.

36:45.230 --> 36:48.980
Let me take - let me-

36:50.140 --> 36:52.660
Come in.

36:52.860 --> 36:55.690
Hey. Hey.

36:55.740 --> 36:59.080
I'm going out for a couple of hours,
so I'll see you later, all right?

36:59.130 --> 37:02.420
Where you going? I'm going to
visit an old friend of mine, Jerri.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.100
I didn't know you had a friend here.
Mm-Hmm.

37:06.300 --> 37:09.130
What does he do? She -

37:09.180 --> 37:13.020
She's a dealer at Caesar's Palace.
Oh.

37:13.070 --> 37:15.850
Wait.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.770
Can I come?

37:17.820 --> 37:21.660
Check out my little guy, right?
Oh, my god!

37:21.710 --> 37:23.530
That's my son Jacob.
Oh.

37:23.580 --> 37:26.460
He's so big. He's almost five.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.330
Can you believe it?
No.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.260
I'm telling you, he is so smart.

37:31.310 --> 37:34.090
Let me see. Yeah, he's brilliant.

37:34.140 --> 37:37.020
Know all the moms say that and everything
but I'm telling you he is.

37:37.070 --> 37:38.890
Is he still with your mom?

37:38.940 --> 37:42.730
Yeah, I - I'm gonna go
see him the day after tomorrow.

37:42.780 --> 37:46.580
So, I saw this movie the other night
on cable -This black and white movie.

37:48.540 --> 37:50.410
I'm telling you, it totally got me.

37:50.460 --> 37:54.300
There's this guy, he's in a
hospital during, like, some war.

37:54.350 --> 37:56.170
And he can't remember who he is.

37:56.220 --> 38:00.060
And he meets this girl and they fall in
love and it's all really great, right?

38:00.110 --> 38:01.930
They get married.
Everything is fabulous.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.340
He has to go to this other town
for a job interview. Mmm!

38:05.390 --> 38:08.700
And he's walking across the street,
he gets hit by a car.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.530
And he's a lord. Yeah, he- Yeah-

38:11.580 --> 38:14.460
He wakes up the person he was, which is,
like, a lord or something.

38:14.510 --> 38:18.300
And he can't remember
who he is now. Ronald Coleman and...

38:18.350 --> 38:20.170
Greer Garson.

38:20.220 --> 38:23.100
Um, she's his secretary? And-and-

38:23.150 --> 38:25.930
And she never tells him! Exactly.

38:25.980 --> 38:29.820
For 15 years- for 15 fucking years
she never says anything.

38:29.870 --> 38:33.660
No, it's unbelievable. You
feel like maybe- I don't know-

38:33.710 --> 38:36.085
Maybe love never dies.

38:36.135 --> 38:38.460
Maybe love never does.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.250
Ring, ring.

38:42.300 --> 38:46.140
Oh, should you get it?
Maybe you should get it. Shh.

38:46.190 --> 38:49.020
Ring, ring.
She doesn't know you're here.

38:49.070 --> 38:51.850
- Hello?
- Hello, Richard?

38:51.900 --> 38:55.690
Oh, hang on one second. I'll get him.

38:55.740 --> 38:58.620
Uh, hey, how's it goin'?
Richard, is that you?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.450
Can I conference in?
I feel left out. Yes, it is.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.330
I have a banana and everything. Yes,
it is, Florence.

39:04.380 --> 39:08.180
What are you doing?
I don't know. I'm just hanging out with my friend here.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.050
Who are you with?
No one.

39:11.100 --> 39:14.900
Um-Who are you with?
Do you wanna come over and play?

39:20.740 --> 39:22.580
You've gotta go eat.
You've gotta go eat?

39:22.620 --> 39:25.960
Eat everything.
This is the only town in the world where...

39:26.010 --> 39:29.300
The breakfast get bigger billing
than the entertainers.

39:30.460 --> 39:34.220
Down the strip a little bit you're gonna
see "steak and eggs," eight-Foot letters.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.020
And underneath,
"in the lounge, I'm really hungry.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.890
Frank Sinatra, jr.
And his orchestra. "

39:38.940 --> 39:42.740
Little tiny letters.
You gotta have glasses to read 'em.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.570
Richard?

39:46.620 --> 39:48.540
Brian. I heard you went AWOL on Pete.

39:48.590 --> 39:50.740
Yeah, I know. I know. Um-

39:55.260 --> 39:59.060
This is Florence.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.940
Um, Brian.

40:02.990 --> 40:05.770
Brian. Pivano.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.660
Pleased to meet you, mr. Pivano.
It's nice to meet you, miss-

40:09.710 --> 40:12.490
Tremain.
Florence Abigail Tremain.

40:12.540 --> 40:16.380
- My friends call me Abby.
- I guess he's not a friend, huh?

40:16.430 --> 40:18.250
Richard is a man of discretion.

40:18.300 --> 40:21.130
We are business partners, after all.

40:21.180 --> 40:25.020
He would never presume to take liberties.
You wanna have a seat?

40:25.070 --> 40:27.220
Yeah.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.180
Yeah, we've been working together
for- What is it-

40:31.580 --> 40:35.380
Like... eight months or something?
Nine months, Richard.

40:35.580 --> 40:37.450
Nine months.

40:37.500 --> 40:40.380
Brian and I went to college together.
Where you working now?

40:40.430 --> 40:43.210
I'm over at Siltel.

40:43.260 --> 40:46.090
So, uh, what sort of business
are you two in?

40:46.140 --> 40:48.970
Women's clothing.
We deal exclusively on the internet.

40:49.020 --> 40:52.820
We're in Las Vegas this weekend
doing research for our new line.

40:53.820 --> 40:56.220
We deal in speciality items,

40:56.270 --> 40:58.885
Erotic fantasy garments,

40:58.935 --> 41:01.450
Latex dresses and whatnot.

41:01.500 --> 41:05.290
We're called love factory dot com.

41:05.340 --> 41:09.140
Underwear, Richard?
Yeah, it was a big opportunity, Brian.

41:10.140 --> 41:12.970
Every woman has a fantasy, Brian.

41:13.020 --> 41:16.860
Most women are too shy to walk into a store

41:16.910 --> 41:18.730
And tell the clerk what they want.

41:18.780 --> 41:22.570
O we're supported largely through advertising

41:22.620 --> 41:25.960
We've had quite a few hits in the first
- Women want to feel desired.

41:26.010 --> 41:29.300
And men love it when their women make
that extra effort to be desirable.

41:30.420 --> 41:32.300
After all,

41:32.420 --> 41:36.020
Without sex, none of us would be born.

41:36.060 --> 41:39.900
And we are all born out of a woman's cunt.

41:39.950 --> 41:43.690
It is the center of the world.

41:43.740 --> 41:47.540
And the more we can
do to glorify that holy spot,

41:48.540 --> 41:52.340
The more we're doing for mankind.

41:52.540 --> 41:55.220
Oh, sister, when you said that word
- I believe it was "cunt"-

41:55.260 --> 41:59.100
I thought he was gonna choke on his drink.
Telling it like it is, Sugar.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.020
A cunt is a cunt is a cunt.

42:05.820 --> 42:09.660
No, don't do that. No, no, no.

42:09.710 --> 42:11.530
Excuse me!

42:11.580 --> 42:14.520
Mink bras, sable panties.

42:14.570 --> 42:17.460
Beaver beaver covers.

42:19.180 --> 42:22.020
Furs for your fur. Fox for your box.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.180
Oh, chinchilla clit warmers.

42:24.230 --> 42:26.220
Chinchilla clit warmers.

43:18.780 --> 43:21.060
Come on.

43:23.580 --> 43:26.410
Oh, fuck. What am I doing?

43:26.460 --> 43:29.340
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
No, it's okay. No. No.

43:29.390 --> 43:31.210
Hey, it's okay. Oh, fuck.

43:31.260 --> 43:35.100
It's okay. Come here,
come here, come here, come here.

43:35.150 --> 43:37.930
Shh.

43:37.980 --> 43:40.810
Richard, no. It's okay.

43:40.860 --> 43:42.780
Richard. Richard! It's okay.

43:42.830 --> 43:44.650
Shh.

43:44.700 --> 43:46.570
Richard- Shh! Shh!

43:46.620 --> 43:50.420
We can't do this. We have to
stick to the agreement.

43:59.100 --> 44:02.900
I'll see you at 10:00.

44:08.700 --> 44:10.740
Fuck.

44:59.580 --> 45:01.500
I want you inside me.

45:02.460 --> 45:04.500
Please.

45:36.140 --> 45:39.940
I don't know what to do now. I can't just
give him a hand job for three days, you know.

45:41.820 --> 45:44.540
You know what, Roxy? I mean,
I'd do it. I wouldn't even mind.

45:44.700 --> 45:48.460
But it's like, fuck,
I think I kind of like him.

45:51.420 --> 45:55.220
No, no. I'm not gonna break the rules.

45:56.220 --> 46:00.020
Tomato juice? In the mini-Bar,
yeah. Why?

46:01.020 --> 46:04.810
Fake my- Are you fucking kidding me?

46:04.860 --> 46:08.660
What? What? And, like,
mix the tomato juice and the lipstick?

46:46.260 --> 46:48.140
You okay?

46:49.020 --> 46:51.100
Of course I'm okay.

47:34.140 --> 47:37.940
<i>How beautiful
you've made yourself</i>

47:41.820 --> 47:45.620
<i>How cruel you've become</i>

47:47.580 --> 47:51.420
<i>How so much like another</i>

47:51.470 --> 47:55.210
<i>That it's no surprise</i>

47:55.260 --> 47:58.620
<i>That I don't recognize you now</i>

47:58.670 --> 48:02.225
<i>You're so beautiful and cruel</i>

48:02.275 --> 48:05.780
<i>You're the meanest flower</i>

48:08.700 --> 48:12.500
<i>You're the meanest flower</i>

48:46.020 --> 48:48.380
Oh, god, you're so wet.

49:00.860 --> 49:03.700
Oh, shit. You're bleeding.

49:03.860 --> 49:05.740
Oh, god. It's okay.

49:05.900 --> 49:08.740
No. What is it?
Come here. It's okay.

49:08.900 --> 49:11.060
Oh, my god.
It's all over you.

49:11.100 --> 49:13.930
Oh, it's okay. Fuck!

49:13.980 --> 49:15.880
I thought it was over.
No, it's okay.

49:15.930 --> 49:17.780
I don't mind, really. It's fine.

49:17.900 --> 49:19.980
Oh, fuck.

49:20.780 --> 49:22.900
It's okay.

49:34.140 --> 49:36.980
I'll get it with ice.

49:37.100 --> 49:39.180
It's fine.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.980
Are you okay?

49:42.780 --> 49:44.740
Are you all right? Uh-

49:45.820 --> 49:47.700
This comes right off this. Oh,
you're so nice.

49:47.780 --> 49:50.500
Why do you have to be so nice?

49:50.620 --> 49:52.660
I'm not nice.

50:05.140 --> 50:07.980
It's gonna come right out.
It's totally fine.

50:08.060 --> 50:11.500
Richard, here. Let me do it. It's-

50:11.580 --> 50:13.450
Here.

50:13.500 --> 50:17.300
Why don't you just take it
right off? Here. Come here.

50:17.540 --> 50:19.780
Come here. Shh.

50:22.300 --> 50:24.420
Stop pushing me! Ow!

50:25.980 --> 50:29.740
I'm sorry. If we don't play by
the rules, this isn't gonna work.

50:29.980 --> 50:31.980
Okay.

50:38.660 --> 50:40.540
Hello.

50:40.700 --> 50:43.580
Hey, Jerri.

50:43.740 --> 50:47.180
Uh, yeah. Hang on one second. Florence!

50:47.260 --> 50:49.460
Jerri on the phone.

50:56.700 --> 51:00.500
Hey, Jer. What's up?

51:00.700 --> 51:02.580
What?

51:02.780 --> 51:06.540
Hey- I can't understand
what you're saying.

51:08.220 --> 51:10.090
Okay, li-

51:10.140 --> 51:13.020
Listen, why don't you just come up here?
No, we're here.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.850
He just fucking lost it, you know.

51:15.900 --> 51:18.780
He started dragging me around
by my hair, and h-He-

51:18.830 --> 51:21.610
He- He slammed my head into the wall.

51:21.660 --> 51:25.500
He was pulling at it like he wanted
my head to come off my neck.

51:25.550 --> 51:28.330
Who? Who is this guy?

51:28.380 --> 51:30.250
He's a really nice guy.

51:30.300 --> 51:33.130
Yeah. I've known him for a while.

51:33.180 --> 51:36.140
He comes to see me, like, like,
uh, two or three times a year.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.140
And, uh, he comes all the way from-

51:40.860 --> 51:43.740
From, like, Scranton fuckin' Pennsylvania.

51:43.790 --> 51:45.660
Where'd you meet him?

51:45.710 --> 51:48.490
Uh, at work.

51:48.540 --> 51:52.380
He, uh, sat down at my table and
didn't get up for three days.

51:52.430 --> 51:54.250
Oh, god.

51:54.300 --> 51:58.140
Look, he's a really- He's a really
lonely guy with a lot of extra cash,

51:58.190 --> 52:00.010
And he's crazy about me.

52:00.060 --> 52:01.930
He even sent my mom...

52:01.980 --> 52:05.770
A birthday present last year.

52:05.820 --> 52:08.700
He's never been violent before.
I mean never.

52:08.750 --> 52:12.500
I- I couldn't see it coming.

52:12.660 --> 52:16.460
Wh-What are you doing?

52:19.380 --> 52:22.220
Trying to support Jacob and my mom.

52:22.300 --> 52:25.140
That's what I'm doing.

52:25.260 --> 52:29.060
Why did he hit you? What did you do?

52:29.140 --> 52:31.060
I, uh, I-I didn't...

52:31.180 --> 52:33.060
Do anything, okay?

52:33.220 --> 52:35.100
No, I didn't mean-

52:35.260 --> 52:37.700
I didn't mean "what did you do?"

52:37.780 --> 52:41.580
I mean, what happened
that he would hit you?

52:48.060 --> 52:50.890
Um,

52:50.940 --> 52:52.810
Mr. Doyle...

52:52.860 --> 52:55.100
Likes to fuck me up the ass.

52:55.260 --> 52:58.660
And, uh,
one night a couple years ago...

52:59.580 --> 53:02.380
He did it to me hard.

53:02.460 --> 53:04.500
I mean, really hard.

53:04.660 --> 53:08.460
And it just- It did something to me,
you know.

53:09.340 --> 53:13.100
When his cock was inside me,
it just got me going...

53:13.220 --> 53:15.100
In this major way.

53:15.180 --> 53:18.740
And as I was coming,
I felt like I had to pee.

53:18.780 --> 53:20.650
And all of the sudden,

53:20.700 --> 53:23.530
I am having this orgasm like
I have never had before,

53:23.580 --> 53:27.380
And all this stuff starts shooting out
of me, like a guy shooting his load.

53:27.460 --> 53:29.780
Oh, my god.

53:30.300 --> 53:32.180
This turns him on. Fuck, yeah.

53:32.260 --> 53:36.060
He knows I'm not faking it.

53:37.060 --> 53:39.900
But, you know, the thing is,
I can't control it,

53:40.020 --> 53:41.900
And tonight I couldn't do it.

53:42.060 --> 53:44.900
It's the second time
in a row that's happened.

53:45.060 --> 53:47.500
First time he was really nice.

53:47.580 --> 53:51.380
And this time he just went fuckin' ape-Shit.

53:52.340 --> 53:54.580
Oh, sweetheart.

53:55.420 --> 53:57.300
I'm sorry.

53:57.460 --> 53:59.980
He took all my fucking money too

54:00.060 --> 54:02.940
He ripped into my purse
like a piece of meat...

54:02.990 --> 54:05.770
And took his $2,000 back.

54:05.820 --> 54:09.620
I was gonna go to Tacoma,
you know, to see-

54:11.580 --> 54:14.420
And now I can't afford the trip.

54:14.620 --> 54:17.460
I can't see Jacob now. I can't
- Hey.

54:17.540 --> 54:19.420
Don't worry about the money.
The money's no problem.

54:19.540 --> 54:22.380
I can just transfer the funds
into your account.

54:22.420 --> 54:24.340
I can't take your money. Hey.

54:24.420 --> 54:26.980
Of course you can. Look at me.
Of course you can.

54:27.060 --> 54:30.100
You're a friend of Florence's. Florence is
a friend of mine. Seriously, it's no problem.

54:30.220 --> 54:33.060
Take it, Jerri. It's fine.

54:33.220 --> 54:35.100
Take it.

54:35.260 --> 54:37.140
What planet did he come from?

54:37.340 --> 54:41.100
I'm still trying to figure that out.

54:42.300 --> 54:44.340
And do you know your account number?

54:44.460 --> 54:47.100
The number of my account, um-

54:47.220 --> 54:49.100
I can't remember.

54:49.980 --> 54:52.860
You know, I just got robbed
and smashed in the face.

54:52.910 --> 54:55.740
How can I remember the number
of my account?

54:55.790 --> 54:58.620
Do you have your checkbook with you?

55:00.540 --> 55:02.460
Uh, yeah. I have my checkbook with me.

55:02.510 --> 55:04.405
Here.

55:04.455 --> 55:06.137
Great.

55:06.187 --> 55:07.820
Okay.

55:11.100 --> 55:12.970
I'm so sorry.

55:13.020 --> 55:15.060
I'm sorry.

55:15.980 --> 55:17.860
I'm sorry.

55:17.980 --> 55:19.860
It's okay, baby.

55:19.980 --> 55:21.980
It's okay.

55:23.580 --> 55:25.620
I'm so lonely.

55:26.460 --> 55:28.340
You know?

55:32.220 --> 55:36.020
I need you, Florence.

55:37.940 --> 55:41.740
I really need you.

55:50.740 --> 55:52.340
Um-

55:52.380 --> 55:54.460
Do you want a drink?
Why don't we have a drink.

55:54.510 --> 55:56.140
Okay.

55:59.260 --> 56:03.020
A drink might be good.

56:03.140 --> 56:06.580
I transferred the funds into your account.

56:06.780 --> 56:07.740
Wow.

56:11.580 --> 56:14.660
You're quite the guy, Richard.

56:22.020 --> 56:23.780
Um,

56:23.900 --> 56:26.100
You know, you don't have to
just watch, Richard.

56:29.820 --> 56:33.420
I mean, you can join in
if you want to.

56:33.660 --> 56:37.450
Yeah, it really hurts.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.420
I mean, we're all friends, aren't we?

56:42.420 --> 56:45.260
Besides, I'm sexier than she is, right?

56:45.380 --> 56:47.260
No! No.

56:47.380 --> 56:49.260
Come on. You're pretty.

56:49.340 --> 56:52.820
You're really pretty. Yeah?

56:52.860 --> 56:55.900
I know you
want to taste me, don't you?

56:56.020 --> 56:57.900
I think you want to touch me.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.420
You don't have to pay him back, Jerri.

57:02.500 --> 57:04.580
He gave you the money.

57:10.380 --> 57:14.180
I wasn't trying to pay him back, Florence.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.820
I just thought...

57:17.020 --> 57:20.620
We all might have a good time, you know.

57:22.620 --> 57:25.580
I mean, you're fucking
him for the money, right?

57:25.660 --> 57:27.540
Right?

57:27.660 --> 57:30.500
I won't have
this conversation with you right now.

57:30.580 --> 57:32.500
You're too upset.

57:32.660 --> 57:36.180
"I'm not gonna have
this conversation with you right now. "

57:37.140 --> 57:40.940
Don't pull that holy shit with me.

57:43.740 --> 57:45.620
Okay?

57:45.740 --> 57:49.540
You're here... to get paid.

57:50.460 --> 57:54.220
Don't be such a fucking whore.

57:57.180 --> 58:00.940
Why are you talking to me
like I'm beneath you,

58:01.100 --> 58:03.940
Like we have no fucking history?

58:04.060 --> 58:05.940
I know you, Florence.

58:08.700 --> 58:10.570
And we are the same.

58:10.620 --> 58:13.340
- No, we're not.
- Fuck you.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.620
Fuck you!

58:16.380 --> 58:20.180
Fuck you and your fucking money!

58:27.740 --> 58:30.100
Is she okay?

58:31.740 --> 58:33.780
Is she all right?

58:39.540 --> 58:41.540
You mad at me?

58:46.140 --> 58:47.820
Hey. Oh. Shh.

58:48.060 --> 58:50.000
Are you sad?

58:50.050 --> 58:51.940
Don't be sad.

58:55.580 --> 58:57.740
Don't be sad.

58:57.820 --> 58:59.780
Come here.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.540
Feel my cock.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:23.460
You can wrap your whole hand
around it. It's so hard.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.700
You just hold it really tight...

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.340
And you just feel it go in a little bit.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.340
It's so hot. So hot.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.300
Just barely in.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.020
Yeah. You want me inside of you so bad.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.140
Tell me you want me inside of you so bad.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.820
Beg me to be inside of you.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.460
Yeah.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.980
Yeah, and you feel my hand on your hips.

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.380
I just- I just pull you.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:59.940
I just pull you on to me,
and your whole body just shakes.

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:03.860
You can just feel how hot and hard...

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.860
And deep inside of you I am.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.820
It just starts throbbing inside of you...

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.700
And your body is just shaking.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.660
I'm just shuddering inside of you.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:20.580
You feel me pull slowly outside of you.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.020
You can just feel all
of me touching you going out.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.850
Then you feel me go inside of you really hard

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.740
I'm inside of you,
and I'm so hard inside of you.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.620
And I just start going in
and out inside of you.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.580
And it's just so hot.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.540
Each time it seems it's hotter.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.540
It's just getting hotter and hotter,

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.010
And you're getting so wet.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.940
Each time you're getting wetter.

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.900
You just want meto keep
- Keep going.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.860
And I'm just
- You feel me getting hotter and hotter.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.860
You feel like you're gonna come,

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.020
And you feel like I'm gonna come.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.100
You can just feel me.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.300
I'm just gonna come so hard inside of you.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.380
And it's getting hotter and hotter.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.300
Then I start slowing down,
and you feel that I'm just about to come...

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.340
Because I'm going so slow.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.300
I'm just- I'm going in and out so slow.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:16.260
I go out, and then I go in,
and I'm inside of you,

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.260
And you feel how hot-

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.140
It's just- The heat,
and it's wet.

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.580
It's going all up inside your back
and your pussy.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:28.460
It's so hot- Your neck, your shoulders
and your arms and your mouth

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.130
You can feel me in your mouth.

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.980
I'm coming so hard. My cock is
just throbbing inside of you.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.820
<i>Daylight trippin'</i>

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:56.005
<i>Now I'm missin'</i>

01:05:56.055 --> 01:05:58.140
<i>Guess I'm slippin'</i>

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:01.930
<i>Slippin' out</i>

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.860
<i>Daylight trippin'</i>

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.285
<i>Now I'm missin'</i>

01:06:07.335 --> 01:06:09.660
<i>Guess I'm slippin'</i>

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:11.530
<i>Slippin' out</i>

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:15.420
<i>I feel that reality's pulsatin'</i>

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:17.290
<i>Gyratin'</i>

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:21.140
<i>All that matters to me is very small</i>

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.010
<i>I'm in orbit</i>

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:27.900
<i>Still standin' on the ground</i>

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:31.285
<i>Guess I'm one</i>

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:34.620
<i>With it all</i>

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.140
It's okay.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.020
It's okay.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.380
Oh, god.

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.100
Oh.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.540
Oh, god.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:11.220
Oh, god, I'm gonna come inside you.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.899
I love you.

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.300
Yeah, baby, that was great.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.300
You're amazing.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.140
You're so amazing.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.700
What?

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.060
You didn't feel anything, did you?

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:24.140
Of course I did.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.060
No, you didn't.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.220
Does it matter?

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.900
So it wasn't real?

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.540
Richard, we did it. That was real.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.380
No, but you didn't feel anything?

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.420
What do you expect?

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.540
I mean, you hired me.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.540
Yeah, but a lot of stuff has happened
since then. No. Nothing's happened.

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.540
It's all in your head.
What about yesterday?

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:09.940
What did you think,
that I was falling in love with you?

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.140
Yeah.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020
Oh, Richard.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.740
I love you.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.540
You don't even know me.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.540
Well-

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.500
Look, I know what you want.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.500
You want- You want to get a girl hot.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:33.420
You want to think that you're so smart
and so smooth that you could turn any girl

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.900
You paid me a lot of money.
I wanted to do it right. I wanted-

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.740
You don't know what I want.

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.700
Okay? You don't have a
fuckin' clue what I want.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.700
You can't-

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.620
You can't buy my feelings.

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:52.540
No. No. No. No. No.
You can't pay to make me love you.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.580
But we're people, aren't we?

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:58.500
And people feel things, don't they?

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.940
I'm your whore.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.860
Have I ever treated you like a whore?
Have I ever been anything but good to you?

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.820
It's not about good or bad.
It's about money.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.740
You have it and I don't.
You pay me to do this, so I did it.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:13.460
You pay me to enjoy it,
so I enjoyed it.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.380
Well, then, you're just dead,
aren't you?

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.460
You wanna fucking feel something?

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.330
Aah! Fuck.

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:44.180
Ow.

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:50.500
You want real?

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:54.380
I'll show you real.

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:43.740
<i>I been delaying</i>

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:46.405
<i>Gratification</i>

01:16:46.455 --> 01:16:48.697
<i>I been ready for</i>

01:16:48.747 --> 01:16:50.890
<i>World domination</i>

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.770
<i>Ready, set, go baby,
don't you know</i>

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:55.740
<i>I'm ready ready, ready,
ready ready, ready, ready</i>

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:59.580
<i>Ready, set, go like a domino</i>

01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:01.500
<i>Kick it over</i>

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.140
Hey, Richard, it's Pete.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.100
I know you don't give a fuck, but our
I.P.O. went through the roof yesterday.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:13.020
You're now worth over $20 million,
you lucky asshole,

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:15.020
And you don't deserve any of it.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:18.380
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you bastard.

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.140
You don't
need to open your door.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.700
You don't need to leave.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.570
You create a frontier...

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:50.420
To put your mattress with
the cables and the C.P.U.'s,

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.220
And you claim a piece of space.

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:03.860
The world breaks
in waves at your fingertips.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.540
You make its choices.

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.660
You decide.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:18.260
And it sings for you when you ask.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.820
Hey. Hey.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.580
It's you.

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:56.820
Yeah.

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.900
You look good.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.660
What do you want me to do, baby?

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.740
What are the options?

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:19.140
The regular routine.

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.180
Sure.

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:29.620
Lap dance, two songs, $60.
