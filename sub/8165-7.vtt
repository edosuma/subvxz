- It was a crack.
- Uh, pop.

16:58.749 --> 16:59.749
- Definitely a crack.

17:00.183 --> 17:01.183
We were making love.

17:02.119 --> 17:03.239
Diana was on top, of course.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.104
And then she arched her back
like a Romanian gymnast.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.331
- It's from rigorous yoga.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.060
I'm very supple of spine.

17:11.962 --> 17:12.210
- Hmm.

17:12.462 --> 17:13.742
- And then I heard
a crack sound,

17:14.331 --> 17:16.114
and I felt a searing pain
in my phallus.

17:17.901 --> 17:19.541
- Oh, my God,
I think she broke your dick.

17:20.904 --> 17:21.169
Doctor!

17:21.438 --> 17:23.118
- I don't understand.
It's not even a bone.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.960
- Well, technically,
it's a penile fracture.

17:25.075 --> 17:26.755
It's when the lining
of the penis ruptures.

17:26.810 --> 17:27.576
It's not uncommon
when the woman's on top

17:28.345 --> 17:30.305
and her entire body weight
is pounding and bending

17:31.281 --> 17:31.713
the engorged penis.

17:32.149 --> 17:32.648
Is that what happened here?

17:33.150 --> 17:35.190
- That's what he wanted.
- I wanted what you wanted!

17:35.485 --> 17:36.925
- We're gonna need
to take a sonogram

17:37.320 --> 17:37.786
before we can operate.

17:38.255 --> 17:39.054
And to do that,
we'll need you fully erect.

17:39.856 --> 17:41.336
- I don't see how
that's gonna happen.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.512
- We can give you
an injection in your penis

17:43.827 --> 17:44.626
to stimulate an erection,
or if you prefer,

17:45.428 --> 17:47.348
we can give you some privacy
with your girlfriend

17:48.098 --> 17:49.098
while she assists you.

17:49.533 --> 17:50.799
- Get her out of here!

17:59.009 --> 18:00.508
- Liza.

18:00.510 --> 18:00.892
What happened?

18:01.278 --> 18:02.027
- Ugh, I'm so sorry
I missed your set.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.539
I accidentally sexted
my boss instead of you,

18:05.315 --> 18:05.847
and I had to call to explain,

18:06.383 --> 18:08.623
and some "Hunger Games" tribute
tried to take my charger,

18:10.020 --> 18:11.203
and I... I hip-checked her.

18:12.389 --> 18:12.754
- No way.

18:13.123 --> 18:14.403
And they kicked you out
for that?

18:14.958 --> 18:16.398
- Why is everyone
so nonviolent here?

18:16.493 --> 18:17.926
We're not that far
from New York.

18:20.397 --> 18:21.095
I'm sorry.

18:21.097 --> 18:23.137
I know that this is
really, really important to you.

18:24.067 --> 18:24.432
- Yeah.

18:24.801 --> 18:25.250
- I clearly can't cut it.

18:25.702 --> 18:26.584
You have to be in your 20s
to do the festival thing,

18:27.470 --> 18:29.510
and I hate saying it,
but I'm just too old for this.

18:31.107 --> 18:32.240
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:33.376 --> 18:34.376
So am I.

18:34.978 --> 18:35.978
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:36.546 --> 18:37.546
Plus, I stink.

18:38.081 --> 18:38.513
- You do stink.

18:38.949 --> 18:40.149
- Whoa, whoa, so do you, babe.

18:40.383 --> 18:41.416
- I know.
I know I reek.

18:42.452 --> 18:43.452
- Hmm.

18:43.587 --> 18:45.370
- You know,
my boss mentioned a B&B.

18:47.157 --> 18:48.157
It's 20 minutes away.

18:49.025 --> 18:49.307
- Mm.

18:49.593 --> 18:50.913
- It's supposed to be
really nice.

18:51.261 --> 18:52.261
- Do they have towels?

18:52.562 --> 18:53.562
- Oh, they have towels.

18:53.864 --> 18:54.904
They have towels for days.

18:55.465 --> 18:56.945
- Oh, tell me more
about these towels.

18:58.134 --> 18:59.367
- And they have pillows...

19:00.604 --> 19:03.271
Soft, warm, fluffy pillows.

19:05.942 --> 19:07.442
- Gabe loves pillows.

19:08.945 --> 19:09.945
- Mm.

19:09.980 --> 19:10.980
- [laughs] Babe.

19:11.114 --> 19:12.147
I love... I love pillows!

19:13.183 --> 19:14.183
I love pillows.
[laughs]

19:17.120 --> 19:18.519
- Uh, Miller?
Liza Miller?

19:18.521 --> 19:19.601
- Excellent.
A room for two.

19:20.624 --> 19:21.624
- Oh, let me get...

19:21.892 --> 19:22.274
- No, I got this.

19:22.659 --> 19:23.108
- Actually, it looks like

19:23.560 --> 19:24.920
your room
has already been paid for

19:25.528 --> 19:26.528
by Empirical Publishing.

19:27.130 --> 19:27.529
- Wow.

19:27.931 --> 19:29.164
Your boss is awesome.

19:35.305 --> 19:36.537
- Wow!

19:36.539 --> 19:37.739
This is beautiful!

19:38.942 --> 19:39.942
- Look, we got a basket.

19:40.410 --> 19:41.743
Got some vino.

19:43.079 --> 19:43.511
And a note.

19:43.947 --> 19:44.947
- Oh, I'll open it.

19:45.081 --> 19:45.480
- I got it.

19:45.882 --> 19:47.162
"Dear Liza,
thanks for your help.

19:47.284 --> 19:47.916
"Couldn't have done it
without you.

19:48.551 --> 19:51.019
Soon enough, you'll be the one
answering the questions."

19:53.490 --> 19:53.972
I see.

19:54.457 --> 19:56.324
Put this robe on,
and get into bed.

19:58.194 --> 19:58.560
- Why?

19:58.929 --> 20:00.969
- So we can take a picture
and send it to your boss,

20:01.331 --> 20:02.331
say "thank you."

20:02.465 --> 20:03.465
- Okay.
