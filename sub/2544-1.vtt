05:01.220 --> 05:03.940
Well, Thomas Becket,

05:04.020 --> 05:06.420
are you satisfied?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
Here I am stripped,

05:08.580 --> 05:10.660
kneeling at your tomb

05:10.740 --> 05:13.060
while those treacherous
Saxon monks of yours

05:13.140 --> 05:16.100
are getting ready
to thrash me.

05:16.140 --> 05:20.340
Me, with my delicate skin.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.420
I bet you'd never have
done the same for me.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.780
But, I suppose I have
to do this penance

05:26.860 --> 05:31.420
and make my peace with you.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.980
What a strange
end to our story.

05:35.060 --> 05:38.180
How cold it was
when we last met

05:38.260 --> 05:40.820
on the shores of France.

05:40.900 --> 05:45.220
Funny, it's nearly
always been cold,

05:45.300 --> 05:46.740
except at the beginning

05:46.820 --> 05:48.780
when we were friends.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.740
We did have a few,

05:50.780 --> 05:55.380
fine summer evenings
with the giris.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.820
Did you love
Gwendolen, Archbishop?

05:58.900 --> 06:01.660
Did you hate me the
night I took her from you,

06:01.700 --> 06:04.460
shouting, "I am the King"?

06:04.540 --> 06:06.260
Perhaps that's what you could

06:06.300 --> 06:10.500
never forgive me for.

06:10.580 --> 06:12.300
Look at them lurking there,

06:12.340 --> 06:14.900
gloating.

06:14.980 --> 06:16.700
Oh, Thomas,

06:16.780 --> 06:20.180
I'm ashamed of this
whole silly masquerade.

06:20.260 --> 06:23.380
All right, so I've come
here to make my peace

06:23.460 --> 06:26.700
with their Saxon hero,
because I need them now,

06:26.740 --> 06:29.660
those Saxon peasants of yours.

06:29.740 --> 06:31.780
Now I'll call them my sons,

06:31.860 --> 06:34.060
as you wanted me to,

06:34.140 --> 06:36.860
you taught me that too.

06:36.940 --> 06:40.580
You taught me everything.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.180
Those were the happy times.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.260
Do you remember?

06:45.340 --> 06:47.340
At the peep of dawn

06:47.420 --> 06:49.460
and as usual
we'd been drinking

06:49.540 --> 06:51.660
and wenching in the town.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.500
You were even better
at that than I was.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.680
Shhh, listen.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.220
Upstairs.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.700
She's up with someone.

07:22.740 --> 07:25.260
Well, go on up.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.020
Get up man, get on up there!

07:52.100 --> 07:55.500
Quick, out through the window.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.140
Thank you.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.220
Come on now.

08:11.260 --> 08:12.460
Come on.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.260
Come on.

08:16.540 --> 08:17.820
Come here.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.380
I'll lay my hands on
her, the dirty slut.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.780
Where is he the swine?

08:21.860 --> 08:22.700
You don't,

08:22.740 --> 08:24.420
don't you dare,
don't you dare.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.980
Here catch.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.460
Go on, get in there.

08:50.820 --> 08:52.900
Here take my good boot.

08:52.980 --> 08:55.299
I can't get my boot back on.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.660
Faster now.

09:44.380 --> 09:45.820
Oh, rub harder pig,

09:45.860 --> 09:47.940
I'm cold.

09:48.940 --> 09:51.420
Ah, no one does it
the way you do, Thomas.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.580
Thank you.

09:52.660 --> 09:56.940
I think you actually
like the cold.

09:57.020 --> 09:59.020
I made you a nobleman,

09:59.100 --> 10:00.700
why do you play
at being my valet?

10:00.780 --> 10:02.460
I'm your servant
in the council chamber,

10:02.500 --> 10:03.980
or here in the bath.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.700
My Norman Barons resent it,

10:05.740 --> 10:07.380
they feel it's your Saxon way

10:07.460 --> 10:08.740
of mocking their nobility.

10:08.820 --> 10:10.300
Nobility lies
in the man, My Prince,

10:10.380 --> 10:12.900
not in the towel.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.820
Have you any idea
how much trouble

10:14.860 --> 10:16.020
I took to make you noble?

10:16.100 --> 10:16.900
I think so,

10:16.940 --> 10:18.460
I recall you pointed
a finger and said,

10:18.540 --> 10:20.500
"Thomas Becket
you are noble".

10:20.580 --> 10:23.580
The Queen and your mother
became very agitated.

10:23.660 --> 10:25.420
They're always agitated.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.340
No, I mean trouble
from the Barons,

10:28.380 --> 10:30.220
they hate you, you know?

10:30.260 --> 10:33.540
Of course, one always
hates what one wrongs.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.900
When you Norman's
invaded England,

10:38.980 --> 10:40.260
you seized our Saxon land,

10:40.340 --> 10:41.620
burned our Saxon homes,

10:41.660 --> 10:44.260
raped our Saxon sisters.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.100
Naturally you hate Saxons.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.940
Don't include me,

10:48.980 --> 10:50.740
it was my great
grandfather William

10:50.820 --> 10:52.660
who was called
"The Conqueror",

10:52.740 --> 10:54.500
I'm an old resident.

10:54.580 --> 10:56.140
I did not mean you.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.460
Didn't you?

10:57.540 --> 10:59.020
You know when I took
you into my service,

10:59.100 --> 11:01.900
everyone predicted you'd
put a knife in my back.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.420
Did you believe them?

11:03.500 --> 11:07.300
No, I showed them that
you were a man of honor,

11:07.340 --> 11:09.460
and a collaborator.

11:09.540 --> 11:11.060
That was accurate of you.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.620
How do you combine the two?

11:12.700 --> 11:13.860
My Lord?

11:13.900 --> 11:17.660
Honor and collaboration?

11:17.740 --> 11:19.220
I don't try.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.620
I love good living,
and good living is Norman.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.940
I love life and the
Saxons only birthright

11:24.020 --> 11:25.780
is to be slaughtered.

11:25.860 --> 11:29.100
One collaborates to live.

11:29.140 --> 11:31.900
And honor?

11:31.980 --> 11:33.860
Honor is a concern
of the living.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.460
One can't very well
be concerned about it

11:35.540 --> 11:37.140
once one's dead.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.780
You're too clever
for me, Thomas,

11:38.860 --> 11:40.460
but I know there's something

11:40.500 --> 11:42.980
not quite right
about your reasoning.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.580
Honor is a
private matter within,

11:46.660 --> 11:47.540
it's an idea

11:47.620 --> 11:49.860
and every man has
his own version of it.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.580
How gracefully
you tell your King

11:51.660 --> 11:53.420
to mind his own business.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.020
Time for the council
meeting, My Lord.

11:56.060 --> 11:59.020
Ugh.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.260
Will My Lord dine
with me tonight?

12:01.340 --> 12:02.660
On gold plates?

12:02.740 --> 12:03.660
Always.

12:03.740 --> 12:06.060
I am your King,
and I eat off silver.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.060
Your expenses are heavy,

12:07.140 --> 12:09.220
I have only my
pleasure to pay for.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.540
Tonight you can
do me the honor

12:10.620 --> 12:12.620
of christening my forks.

12:12.700 --> 12:13.500
Forks?

12:13.540 --> 12:14.620
Yes, from Florence.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.740
A new little invention,

12:15.820 --> 12:17.900
it's for pronging meat
and carrying it to the mouth,

12:17.940 --> 12:19.460
it saves you
dirtying your fingers.

12:19.540 --> 12:20.780
Then you dirty the fork.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.140
Yes, but its washable.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.140
So are you fingers,

12:23.180 --> 12:24.020
I don't see the point.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.140
Well, it hasn't any
practically speaking

12:25.220 --> 12:26.060
but it's refined,

12:26.140 --> 12:26.940
it's subtle,

12:26.980 --> 12:29.220
it's very un-Norman.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.260
You must order me some.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.820
For my Barons.

12:34.900 --> 12:35.940
I have enough
forks to go around,

12:36.020 --> 12:37.420
bring the gentleman
with you tonight.

12:37.460 --> 12:38.380
I shall.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.300
We won't tell them
what they're for.

12:40.340 --> 12:42.700
They'll probably think
they're a new kind of dagger.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.500
All right, gentlemen,

12:49.580 --> 12:50.940
the Council is open.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.780
Gentlemen,
I've called you here

13:00.860 --> 13:03.420
to find out why
a simple request for taxes

13:03.460 --> 13:06.140
causes such
unpriestly caterwauling.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.060
My Lord...

13:07.140 --> 13:08.780
We must come to
an understanding

13:08.860 --> 13:10.540
about who rules this kingdom,

13:10.620 --> 13:11.340
the church...

13:11.420 --> 13:12.860
My Lord, I wish to ask you...

13:12.940 --> 13:16.380
Just a moment, Archbishop.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.060
The church, or me?

13:19.100 --> 13:21.020
There are many troublesome
issues between us,

13:21.060 --> 13:22.740
which call for a reckoning.

13:22.820 --> 13:24.100
Amongst other abuses

13:24.180 --> 13:25.220
is the claim you make

13:25.300 --> 13:26.380
of judging your clergy

13:26.460 --> 13:28.260
accused of civil crimes

13:28.340 --> 13:30.100
in your own
ecclesiastical courts.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.980
I warn you,

13:32.060 --> 13:34.860
there can be only one
justice in this country,

13:34.940 --> 13:37.020
and that is the Kings.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.740
But before we quarrel,

13:38.820 --> 13:41.020
here is some happy news.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.580
I have decided to revive

13:42.660 --> 13:44.380
the office of
Chancellor of England,

13:44.420 --> 13:46.380
keeper of the Lion's Seal,

13:46.460 --> 13:49.379
and entrust it to
our loyal servant

13:49.380 --> 13:51.460
Thomas Becket.

14:04.980 --> 14:07.340
Yes, my little Saxon?

14:09.460 --> 14:10.740
My Lord?

14:10.820 --> 14:13.700
Well, for once I've
taken you by surprise.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.420
My Lord,

14:19.500 --> 14:20.900
this is a stupendous honor,

14:20.980 --> 14:22.980
for which I may
not be worthy.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.940
I'm inexperienced
in these matters

14:25.020 --> 14:26.220
and frivolous by nature.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.140
Rubbish,

14:27.220 --> 14:28.860
you know more than
all of us put together.

14:28.940 --> 14:30.900
He's read books
you know, its amazing.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.940
He's drunk and wenched
his way through London

14:33.020 --> 14:35.500
but he's thinking all the
time, aren't you, Thomas?

14:35.580 --> 14:38.580
He'll checkmate
the lot of you,

14:38.620 --> 14:40.940
even you Archbishop.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.340
I never did anything
without your advice.

14:43.420 --> 14:44.780
No one knew it,

14:44.820 --> 14:48.220
now everyone will, that's all.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.580
There,

14:50.660 --> 14:52.340
that's the
Great Seal of England,

14:52.420 --> 14:53.740
don't lose it,

14:53.820 --> 14:55.340
without the seal
there's no more England

14:55.420 --> 14:56.820
and we'll all have to pack up

14:56.900 --> 14:58.740
and go back to Normandy.

14:58.820 --> 15:00.460
May I crave leave

15:00.540 --> 15:02.860
to greet our young
and learned friend,

15:02.940 --> 15:04.380
for I noticed him

15:04.460 --> 15:06.620
when he was first
made Archdeacon.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.100
Thank you, Archbishop,

15:08.140 --> 15:09.820
but don't rely
too much on Becket

15:09.900 --> 15:11.140
to play your game,

15:11.220 --> 15:12.540
he's my man.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.260
I'd forgotten you were
an Archdeacon, Thomas.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.020
So had I, My Prince.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.780
Now to business.

15:18.860 --> 15:20.700
The law demands

15:20.780 --> 15:22.019
that every landowner

15:22.020 --> 15:23.500
send soldiers
to give me service

15:23.580 --> 15:25.140
or pay a tax in silver,

15:25.220 --> 15:26.420
is that correct?

15:26.460 --> 15:28.020
I have heard so, My Lord.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.580
We are about
to cross the channel

15:29.660 --> 15:31.300
to force Louis of France

15:31.380 --> 15:34.300
to return the Norman towns
he has taken from us.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.420
I have received
neither soldiers

15:36.500 --> 15:39.540
nor silver from you
gentlemen, for this war.

15:39.580 --> 15:41.660
But surely one must
distinguish between

15:41.740 --> 15:43.340
the individual landowner

15:43.420 --> 15:44.980
and God's church?

15:45.060 --> 15:46.380
The law doesn't distinguish.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.140
But this has never
been spoken of before.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.180
I've never been
this poor before.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.060
No, I've made up my mind

15:52.100 --> 15:54.220
and I'm passing
around the plate,

15:54.260 --> 15:57.620
just drop in the money.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.420
Oh, my backside's sore.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.940
Is that all,
count your blessings, Sire.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.220
I don't know
about you, Thomas,

16:04.260 --> 16:05.220
but I'm starving,

16:05.300 --> 16:06.980
have them bring
us something to eat.

16:09.300 --> 16:11.100
The layman who shirks his duty

16:11.180 --> 16:13.140
and fails to supply
his King with arms

16:13.220 --> 16:14.700
should pay the tax,

16:14.780 --> 16:17.020
nobody will question that.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.140
Least of all the clergy.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.300
On the other hand,
a priest's duty

16:21.380 --> 16:24.020
is to assist his
King with his prayers

16:24.100 --> 16:26.260
for Godliness and peace,

16:26.340 --> 16:28.220
he cannot maintain men at arms

16:28.260 --> 16:30.300
without violating
the very essence

16:30.380 --> 16:32.300
of that sacred function

16:32.340 --> 16:35.420
therefore he cannot be
held liable for the tax.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.260
Your priest
fought well enough

16:37.300 --> 16:38.380
in the days of a conquest

16:38.460 --> 16:40.460
when there was
booty to be had.

16:40.540 --> 16:42.780
Sword in fist,
rumps in the saddle,

16:42.860 --> 16:44.940
death to Saxons scum,
it's God's will,

16:45.020 --> 16:46.020
it's God's will.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.060
Those violent days are over.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.900
The priest is back
in his sanctuary

16:49.980 --> 16:51.940
it is peacetime now.

16:51.980 --> 16:54.500
But not for long, pay up,

16:54.580 --> 16:55.740
I don't intend to budge.

16:55.780 --> 16:56.900
Come on Chancellor,
say something,

16:56.980 --> 17:01.460
has your new title
made you tongue-tied?

17:01.540 --> 17:03.140
May I respectfully draw

17:03.220 --> 17:05.098
to My Lord
Archbishop's attention

17:05.099 --> 17:06.540
one small point?

17:06.619 --> 17:08.300
Respectfully but firmly,

17:08.339 --> 17:09.940
you're Chancellor now.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.619
England is a ship,

17:11.660 --> 17:14.300
the King is the
captain of the ship.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.460
That's neat, I like that.

17:16.540 --> 17:17.980
My Lord Chancellor,

17:18.060 --> 17:19.339
in point of fact,

17:19.420 --> 17:21.220
there is also a saying

17:21.260 --> 17:25.099
the captain is sole
master after God.

17:26.339 --> 17:28.300
After God!

17:32.380 --> 17:34.900
Nobody's questioning
God's authority, Archbishop.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.300
Most certainly God
protects the ship

17:36.380 --> 17:37.420
by inspiring the captain

17:37.500 --> 17:38.500
but I've never heard

17:38.580 --> 17:39.700
that he determines
the wages of the crew,

17:39.740 --> 17:41.540
nor instructs the
paymaster in his duties.

17:41.620 --> 17:45.220
God has more
important business.

17:45.300 --> 17:46.580
Our young deacon's ambition

17:46.660 --> 17:49.140
has carried him
away from the church

17:49.180 --> 17:51.380
but he cannot have forgotten
that what is important

17:51.460 --> 17:54.100
is revealed to man
only through his church

17:54.180 --> 17:56.940
in the person of our
Holy Father in Rome,

17:56.980 --> 17:59.020
his bishops and his priests.

17:59.100 --> 18:02.620
Or does the Chancellor
think otherwise?

18:02.700 --> 18:05.060
True, there is a priest
onboard every ship.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.380
He gives God's blessings,

18:07.460 --> 18:08.740
but neither God nor the church

18:08.780 --> 18:11.660
ask him to take the
wheel from the helmsman.

18:11.740 --> 18:13.020
My Reverend Lord,
the Bishop of London

18:13.100 --> 18:14.619
who I understand
is the son of a sailor

18:14.620 --> 18:17.460
surely cannot
have forgotten that.

18:17.540 --> 18:19.580
I will not allow
personal insinuation

18:19.660 --> 18:21.180
to compromise the integrity

18:21.260 --> 18:22.820
and honor of the church.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.100
Please, Bishop, no long words.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.940
All that's at stake
here is its money.

18:28.020 --> 18:29.900
I need money to
fight the French,

18:29.980 --> 18:31.260
will the church give it to me,

18:31.300 --> 18:32.660
yes or no?

18:32.740 --> 18:33.780
My Lord,

18:33.860 --> 18:36.020
your illustrious ancestor
William the Conqueror

18:36.100 --> 18:38.740
granted these tax
exemptions to the church.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.100
May he rest in peace,

18:40.180 --> 18:41.620
where he is now,
he doesn't need money.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.860
I'm still on Earth and I do.

18:43.940 --> 18:45.300
This is not primarily

18:45.380 --> 18:47.780
a question of money,
Your Highness,

18:47.860 --> 18:50.260
this is a
question of principle.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.780
I need troops, Bishop.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.060
I've sent for 3,000 Swiss

18:54.140 --> 18:56.140
to help me fight
the King of France

18:56.220 --> 18:59.580
and no one has ever paid
the Swiss with principles.

18:59.660 --> 19:00.940
My Lord, Chancellor,

19:01.020 --> 19:03.740
it is pointless to
continue this discussion.

19:03.820 --> 19:07.020
The law has given us
the means of coercion,

19:07.100 --> 19:08.740
we will use it.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.860
You,

19:09.940 --> 19:12.740
you owe everything
to Holy Mother Church.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.660
Would you dare plunge
a dagger into her bosom?

19:15.700 --> 19:20.700
My Lord and King who
rules by the grace of God,

19:20.740 --> 19:21.860
has given me his seal

19:21.940 --> 19:24.820
with the three
lions to protect.

19:24.900 --> 19:28.700
My mother is England now.

19:28.780 --> 19:29.820
Traitor,

19:29.900 --> 19:31.060
Saxon.

19:31.140 --> 19:32.140
My Reverend friend,

19:32.220 --> 19:34.540
I strongly suggest that
you respect my Chancellor

19:34.620 --> 19:36.420
or else I'll call my guards.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
Ahh, here they are now.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.140
Oh, no,

19:47.180 --> 19:49.300
it's only my snack.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.100
Now, gentlemen,
if you will excuse me,

19:53.180 --> 19:54.220
at this hour in the morning

19:54.300 --> 19:55.540
I need sustenance

19:55.620 --> 19:57.980
or else I tend to feel weak

19:58.060 --> 20:01.180
and a king must never weaken,

20:01.220 --> 20:03.780
I'm sure you will agree.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.700
I'll have it in my chapel.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.140
Then I can pray
directly afterwards.

20:08.220 --> 20:11.540
Come on, Thomas,
keep me company.

20:11.620 --> 20:14.340
He means it's
time for the hunt.

20:14.420 --> 20:18.060
Not until we have
eaten, my dear Bishop.

20:49.900 --> 20:50.620
Race?

20:50.700 --> 20:51.740
Right.

21:19.180 --> 21:19.940
The Kings hunt.

21:20.020 --> 21:21.500
Eh?

21:21.580 --> 21:22.940
Oh, inside quick.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.100
Let's get under cover

21:43.180 --> 21:44.580
before we're drowned.

21:47.420 --> 21:48.900
We've lost the Barons.

21:48.940 --> 21:49.940
Oh, they'll find us,

21:50.020 --> 21:52.180
here, hold this.

21:57.980 --> 22:00.140
Oh, I'm cold, my pretty.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.820
Go on sit on there,
that's a good girl.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.380
Go on, get on there.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.780
I'm freezing,
get the fire going.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.140
There'll be no
wood in this house.

22:13.220 --> 22:15.100
In the middle of the forest?

22:15.140 --> 22:16.060
These people are entitled

22:16.100 --> 22:17.700
to two measures
of deadwood a year,

22:17.780 --> 22:20.460
one branch more and they hang.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.740
My edict?

22:21.820 --> 22:23.340
Your edict.

22:33.860 --> 22:34.940
Come here, old man.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.340
We need firewood.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.780
Don't be afraid.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.980
Thomas!

22:53.020 --> 22:55.660
Thomas, come here!

22:55.700 --> 22:58.460
Look at this.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.900
She stinks a bit
but we could wash her,

23:00.940 --> 23:03.460
what would you think
of it, cleaned up a little?

23:03.540 --> 23:04.940
She's a child.

23:04.980 --> 23:07.140
What would it be
like when it's a woman.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.060
How old would you
say it was, 16, 17?

23:10.140 --> 23:12.420
It can speak, My Lord,
how old are you.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.180
Eh?

23:14.220 --> 23:15.540
Of course it can speak.

23:15.580 --> 23:18.980
How old's your daughter, dog?

23:19.020 --> 23:20.380
Odd the number of
dumb people I meet

23:20.460 --> 23:21.580
when I set foot
out of my palace,

23:21.620 --> 23:23.140
I rule over
a kingdom of mutes.

23:23.220 --> 23:23.960
They're afraid.

23:23.980 --> 23:25.100
Quite right, too.

23:25.180 --> 23:28.180
Don't stand there,
put the wood on the fire.

23:28.260 --> 23:29.820
Hello, pretty.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.500
Look at it.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.100
The odd thing is it's so ugly,

23:45.180 --> 23:47.300
yet it makes such
pretty daughters.

23:47.380 --> 23:50.660
You're a member of the
family, explain that?

23:50.700 --> 23:52.460
Well, at 20 before
he lost his teeth

23:52.500 --> 23:54.980
and took on that ageless
look the common people have,

23:55.060 --> 23:56.020
he may have been handsome.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.220
He may have had
one night of love,

23:57.300 --> 24:00.220
one moment when he was
a king and shed his fear.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.580
Afterwards, his
paupers life went on

24:02.660 --> 24:05.420
eternally the same.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.620
The moment faded

24:07.700 --> 24:10.660
and he forgot it all,

24:10.740 --> 24:13.140
the seed was sown.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.980
Will she grow ugly too?

24:15.060 --> 24:16.620
Surely.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.820
If we made her a whore

24:17.900 --> 24:19.140
and kept her at the palace,

24:19.220 --> 24:21.020
would she stay pretty?

24:21.100 --> 24:22.260
Perhaps.

24:22.340 --> 24:24.380
Then we'd be doing her
a service, wouldn't we?

24:24.460 --> 24:26.660
No doubt.

24:26.740 --> 24:27.900
Look at it,

24:27.980 --> 24:29.940
it understands every word.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.460
Stop staring at me, dog,

24:31.540 --> 24:33.220
get me something to drink.

24:35.780 --> 24:37.260
I have some
drink in my saddle.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.820
What's the matter, Thomas?

24:38.900 --> 24:41.180
Nothing.

24:41.220 --> 24:43.100
I'm getting you a drink.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.020
Thank you, Thomas.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.740
Our escort.
want some?

25:23.820 --> 25:26.380
What's the matter, you hurt?

25:26.460 --> 25:27.780
It's nothing.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.460
Show me.

25:30.540 --> 25:34.060
Now you know you can't
stand the sight of blood.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.940
My horse bit me.

25:39.260 --> 25:41.060
That is too funny.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.340
My Lord here, makes us all
look silly at the jousts

25:43.420 --> 25:45.060
with his fancy horsemanship,

25:45.140 --> 25:46.300
he goes to his saddlebags

25:46.380 --> 25:49.860
and gets bitten like a groom.

25:49.940 --> 25:53.620
You look quite
shaken, little Saxon.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.620
Funny, I can't bear
to think of you in pain.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.340
All this just
to get me a drink

25:59.420 --> 26:02.780
wounded in the
service of the king.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.580
This deserves a gift.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.340
What would you like?

26:15.060 --> 26:17.500
This girl,

26:17.580 --> 26:19.740
I fancy her.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.580
That's very tiresome of you,

26:23.660 --> 26:25.380
I fancy her myself,

26:25.420 --> 26:26.780
and where that
subjects concerned

26:26.820 --> 26:31.780
friendship goes by the boar.

26:31.860 --> 26:34.660
All right, she's yours.

26:37.340 --> 26:38.740
Thank you, My Prince.

26:38.820 --> 26:42.780
But you will return the
favor equally one day.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.780
At your pleasure.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.980
Equally, favor for favor,

26:48.020 --> 26:51.420
you give me your
word as a gentleman?

26:51.460 --> 26:53.220
I do.

26:53.260 --> 26:55.220
Right, she's yours.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.260
Shall we take her with us

26:56.340 --> 26:57.420
or shall we have her sent?

26:57.500 --> 27:00.300
No, no, no, the
soldiers can bring her.

27:03.820 --> 27:06.020
Wash your daughter,
dog, and kill her fleas,

27:06.100 --> 27:07.700
she's coming to the palace

27:07.780 --> 27:09.340
for My Lordship here.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.420
He's a Saxon too,

27:11.500 --> 27:12.980
so I hope you'll be pleased.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.420
Give him money, Thomas,

27:14.460 --> 27:16.580
I'm feeling generous
this morning.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.100
Don't worry
about your daughter,

27:23.140 --> 27:25.940
nobody will come
to take her away,

27:26.020 --> 27:27.860
I'll see to that.

27:27.900 --> 27:28.940
And tell your son

27:29.020 --> 27:30.260
he should stay
hidden in the forest

27:30.340 --> 27:33.220
until he can
handle a knife better.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.820
Here.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.300
Forgive me,

28:39.340 --> 28:42.060
not for fighting,
my dear Baron,

28:42.140 --> 28:43.980
for eating.

29:13.340 --> 29:15.260
Go on, it's lovely.

29:28.940 --> 29:30.820
Noisy brutes.

29:30.860 --> 29:32.700
You seem to spend
a great deal of time

29:32.780 --> 29:34.140
in their company.

29:34.180 --> 29:37.100
No, I can forget it
when I come to you.

29:37.180 --> 29:39.660
I'm happy that
I can relieve you.

29:39.740 --> 29:42.380
Now don't tease me
tonight, Gwendolen.

29:42.460 --> 29:45.580
I'm off to France
again tomorrow, and war.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.660
I am My Lord's captive,

29:47.740 --> 29:49.460
whatever his purpose

29:49.540 --> 29:50.980
and whatever his mood.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.260
I hope so.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.900
It is God's will,

29:53.980 --> 29:54.940
since he gave the Norman's

29:55.020 --> 29:57.620
victory over my people.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.540
And that's the only
reason you're here?

29:59.620 --> 30:01.980
If the Welsh had won the war,

30:02.060 --> 30:04.420
I would have married
a man of my own race

30:04.460 --> 30:06.900
at my father's castle.

30:06.980 --> 30:10.380
God did not will it so.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.980
All right.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.020
I'm sorry I was so
late coming to you

30:14.100 --> 30:16.660
but the King is demanding

30:16.740 --> 30:21.420
and the Barons
have to be kept at bay.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.180
I'm lying,

30:23.260 --> 30:24.500
you are My Lord,

30:24.580 --> 30:26.940
God or no God.

30:27.020 --> 30:28.900
If we had won the war,

30:28.940 --> 30:30.300
you could just as easily

30:30.340 --> 30:32.980
have taken me from
my father's castle.

30:33.020 --> 30:35.100
I would have come with you

30:35.140 --> 30:37.060
for you had taken my heart

30:37.100 --> 30:39.620
before you captured my body.

30:43.060 --> 30:45.820
Have I said
something wrong?

30:45.900 --> 30:48.620
Somehow I can
never support the idea

30:48.660 --> 30:49.820
of being loved.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.540
I told you that.

31:07.540 --> 31:09.660
Oh, please.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.100
Sit.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.180
Play something,

31:16.260 --> 31:17.820
something sad,

31:17.900 --> 31:20.220
it helps the digestion.

31:22.220 --> 31:23.940
Play.

31:32.340 --> 31:35.540
Oh, sweet and melancholy.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.259
Sit, Thomas,

31:40.260 --> 31:43.420
witness one of
my finer moments.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
I behave like a brute,

31:45.540 --> 31:49.700
but I'm as soft as
swan's down inside.

31:51.620 --> 31:52.660
You know, Thomas,

31:52.740 --> 31:54.340
sometimes I think
that you and I

31:54.420 --> 31:57.500
are the only civilized
men in England.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.580
I eat with a fork,

31:59.620 --> 32:03.260
and you've made
me into a man

32:03.300 --> 32:07.380
of the most
delicate sensibilities

32:07.460 --> 32:09.700
and now if you
really love me

32:09.780 --> 32:13.300
you should find me a
beautiful well bred girl

32:13.380 --> 32:15.460
to give me a little polish.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.140
Favor for favor,

32:20.220 --> 32:22.020
do you remember?

32:22.100 --> 32:24.900
I am your servant, My Lord.

32:24.980 --> 32:27.820
All that I have is yours.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.060
But you are also
gracious enough to say

32:31.100 --> 32:32.820
I am your friend.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.780
Yes, that's what I mean,

32:34.860 --> 32:39.140
as one friend to another.

32:39.220 --> 32:42.220
You do care for her then?

32:42.300 --> 32:46.220
You do care about something?

32:46.300 --> 32:49.220
Or do you?

32:49.300 --> 32:51.140
Go on, tell me,

32:51.180 --> 32:54.940
tell me if you
care for her or not?

32:55.020 --> 32:58.020
I said, "favor for favor"

32:58.100 --> 33:01.180
and I asked for your word.

33:01.260 --> 33:06.020
And I gave it to you.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.420
Right.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.620
Well, that's settled then.

33:09.700 --> 33:12.260
May I have a moment's grace?

33:12.340 --> 33:14.620
Surely, surely.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.460
After all, I'm not a savage.

33:23.860 --> 33:26.980
Did you promise me to him?

33:27.060 --> 33:29.340
No.

33:29.420 --> 33:33.260
I promised him
anything he asked for.

33:33.340 --> 33:34.780
I never thought
it would be you.

33:34.820 --> 33:36.180
If he sends me away tomorrow,

33:36.260 --> 33:38.980
will you take me back?

33:39.020 --> 33:40.620
No.

33:43.380 --> 33:45.980
I leave you this,

33:46.060 --> 33:48.780
you've almost
learned to play it.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.700
You've not found anything

33:52.780 --> 33:57.300
in the whole worid
to care for, have you?

33:57.380 --> 33:58.420
No.

33:58.460 --> 34:00.700
We both belong
to a conquered race,

34:00.780 --> 34:02.020
but you've forgotten

34:02.100 --> 34:03.500
that people
robbed of everything

34:03.540 --> 34:06.420
can still have one thing
left to call their own.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.340
Yes,

34:08.380 --> 34:10.820
where honor should be,

34:10.860 --> 34:16.219
in me there is only a void.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.580
I loved you,

34:18.659 --> 34:20.820
Thomas Becket.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.340
My Lord.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.060
Enter.

35:07.780 --> 35:10.060
How careless you are, Thomas,

35:10.100 --> 35:12.700
you had forgotten her.

35:12.780 --> 35:16.060
But you told me
that you fancied her

35:16.100 --> 35:18.020
and I remembered.

35:18.060 --> 35:20.420
You see I really
am your friend

35:20.500 --> 35:24.420
and you're wrong
not to love me.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.340
Goodnight, Sire.

35:40.500 --> 35:44.299
Shall I undress, My Lord?

35:44.300 --> 35:46.179
What?

35:46.180 --> 35:48.620
Shall I undress?

36:44.940 --> 36:46.100
Thomas?

36:47.060 --> 36:48.300
Thomas?

36:57.020 --> 36:59.580
She's dead.

36:59.660 --> 37:03.340
She's killed herself.

37:03.380 --> 37:06.460
All this blood.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.340
Help me, Thomas,

37:08.420 --> 37:11.100
I'm frightened.

37:11.180 --> 37:13.140
I'm the King!

37:16.180 --> 37:17.860
Get rid of her.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.860
Guard.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.940
I'm sleeping here tonight.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.860
Give this girl a silver
piece and let her go.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.500
He won't hurt you.

37:42.060 --> 37:47.780
I don't want to
be alone tonight.

37:47.820 --> 37:50.860
I'm here, My Prince.

37:50.940 --> 37:53.140
You'll hate me now.

37:57.100 --> 38:01.660
I'll never be
able to trust you.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.620
You have nothing to fear.

38:03.700 --> 38:07.140
You gave me your seal,

38:07.220 --> 38:08.500
and while I wear it

38:08.540 --> 38:11.500
my duty is to my king.

38:11.580 --> 38:14.380
But I'll never know

38:14.420 --> 38:17.660
what you're thinking.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.580
Sleep now.

38:20.620 --> 38:24.420
We cross the channel tomorrow.

38:24.460 --> 38:26.620
When we face the French
on the field of battle

38:26.700 --> 38:30.780
there will be simple
answers to everything,

38:30.820 --> 38:32.580
so long as Becket must
improvise his honor

38:32.660 --> 38:35.900
from day to day,

38:35.980 --> 38:38.180
he will serve you faithfully.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.020
But what if one day

38:55.100 --> 38:58.340
he should meet
his honor in truth,

38:58.380 --> 39:00.300
face to face?

39:05.900 --> 39:09.340
But where is Becket's honor?

39:44.860 --> 39:46.900
An early good morning
to you, gentlemen,

39:46.980 --> 39:49.420
I've just ridden
from the town.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.860
I've arranged for
its capitulation.

39:52.940 --> 39:54.339
Well, will there be loot?

39:54.340 --> 39:55.580
No, I want these people

39:55.660 --> 39:56.820
to collaborate
with good grace.

39:56.860 --> 39:59.060
The French Bishop will
deliver the keys of the city

39:59.140 --> 40:00.500
to the King at eight
o'clock in the cathedral.

40:00.540 --> 40:02.580
No fighting,
what are we here for?

40:02.660 --> 40:05.140
To secure King Henry's
possessions in France.

40:05.220 --> 40:07.500
You have three more
towns to recapture.

40:07.580 --> 40:10.500
I'd rather sack the town
and slaughter the lot.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.180
Yes, and have a dead city.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.660
No, I want to give
the King living cities

40:13.740 --> 40:15.900
to increase his wealth.

40:15.940 --> 40:17.020
From dawn this morning

40:17.100 --> 40:19.580
I'm the townspeople's
dearest friend.

40:19.660 --> 40:21.700
And what of England's pride?

40:21.780 --> 40:23.620
England's pride, my dear Baron

40:23.660 --> 40:25.420
is to succeed.

40:32.260 --> 40:34.700
What a mentality.

40:38.540 --> 40:40.700
Chancellor of England.

40:40.780 --> 40:42.780
Who knows what he is,

40:42.860 --> 40:44.620
he's a Saxon.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.660
Release him.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.060
Leave us Sergeant.

41:44.140 --> 41:44.860
My Lord?

41:44.940 --> 41:46.580
Leave us.

41:52.940 --> 41:54.900
What are you, a Saxon
monk doing in France,

41:54.980 --> 41:56.020
they'll kill you, you know?

41:56.100 --> 41:57.180
I'm prepared to die.

41:57.260 --> 41:58.300
How old are you?

41:58.380 --> 41:59.900
18.

41:59.940 --> 42:02.540
Hmm, dying is easy at 18.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.740
Your knife stinks of onions

42:03.820 --> 42:05.780
like every proper
little Saxon's knife.

42:05.860 --> 42:07.660
You used to be a Saxon.

42:07.740 --> 42:09.380
Now you belong
to the Normans.

42:09.460 --> 42:10.740
I see.

42:10.780 --> 42:12.100
A Saxon knife

42:12.140 --> 42:14.460
for a Saxon collaborator.

42:14.540 --> 42:15.780
Did you think
that by killing me

42:15.820 --> 42:16.980
you could liberate your race?

42:17.060 --> 42:19.780
No, not my race, myself.

42:19.860 --> 42:20.860
From what?

42:20.940 --> 42:24.380
My shame and yours.

42:24.460 --> 42:26.300
The Normans have
occupied England

42:26.380 --> 42:28.020
for a hundred years
since Hastings,

42:28.100 --> 42:29.900
shame is an old
vintage to the Saxon.

42:29.980 --> 42:31.140
Your father and
your grandfather

42:31.220 --> 42:32.660
drank it to the dregs.

42:32.740 --> 42:34.140
The cup is empty now.

42:34.180 --> 42:36.220
No, never.

42:36.260 --> 42:37.980
What's your name?

42:40.140 --> 42:42.780
What is your name?

42:42.860 --> 42:44.740
John.

42:44.820 --> 42:47.540
Sergeant.

42:47.620 --> 42:48.900
Well, Brother John,

42:48.980 --> 42:51.100
I'm going to save your life.

42:51.180 --> 42:52.460
It has no importance for me

42:52.540 --> 42:53.780
but it's very rare for fate

42:53.860 --> 42:55.500
to bring one face to face

42:55.580 --> 42:59.020
with one's own
ghost when young.

42:59.100 --> 43:00.100
My Lord?

43:00.180 --> 43:01.860
Have this monk
returned to England

43:01.940 --> 43:04.580
to the custody of the
Abbott of his monastery.

43:04.620 --> 43:07.060
I want him treated
without brutality,

43:07.140 --> 43:08.940
but carefully watched.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.900
Yes, My Lord.

43:34.340 --> 43:35.780
My Lord?

43:38.660 --> 43:40.220
Good morning, My Lord.

43:41.980 --> 43:45.500
Oh, French wine.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.700
I had a little
too much last night.

43:47.780 --> 43:50.780
It's their major
contribution to civilization.

43:50.860 --> 43:52.220
Here's another.

43:53.220 --> 43:55.260
I must say I adore
my French possessions,

43:55.340 --> 43:57.580
they're certainly
worth recapturing.

43:57.660 --> 44:00.460
What's your name, my pretty?

44:00.540 --> 44:01.500
Name?

44:01.580 --> 44:02.380
Marie.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.340
Marie, very French.

44:04.420 --> 44:08.380
A French luxury
is very luxurious.

44:08.460 --> 44:10.979
And for the moment free.

44:10.980 --> 44:13.300
We take possession of
the town this morning.

44:13.340 --> 44:15.620
Yes, I heard.

44:15.660 --> 44:17.740
You managed that
very well, Thomas.

44:17.820 --> 44:20.540
Personally, I shall
miss the fighting,

44:20.620 --> 44:22.580
meanwhile we have
some business to discuss.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.700
I've been studying the
dispatches from England.

44:24.780 --> 44:27.220
You love work don't you?

44:27.300 --> 44:28.740
If you love anything.

44:28.780 --> 44:31.780
I love doing what I have
to do, and doing it well.

44:31.820 --> 44:35.460
You'd be as efficient against
me as for me, wouldn't you?

44:35.540 --> 44:37.700
If fate had
arranged it that way.

44:37.780 --> 44:40.580
So what in most
people is morality,

44:40.660 --> 44:43.940
in you it's
just an exercise in,

44:44.020 --> 44:46.020
what's the word?

44:46.100 --> 44:47.500
Aesthetics.

44:47.580 --> 44:49.020
Yes, that's the word.

44:49.060 --> 44:50.820
Always, aesthetics.

44:50.900 --> 44:53.820
Yes.

44:53.900 --> 44:56.820
Well now,

44:56.860 --> 44:58.780
look at that.

44:58.820 --> 45:01.100
Isn't that aesthetic, too?

45:01.180 --> 45:03.100
Some people go into
ecstasies over cathedrals

45:03.180 --> 45:05.340
but that's a work of art.

45:05.380 --> 45:06.340
Look at it,

45:06.420 --> 45:08.300
round as an apple.

45:10.060 --> 45:12.100
Want her?

45:12.140 --> 45:14.620
Business, My Lord.

45:14.660 --> 45:17.020
All right, business.

45:17.100 --> 45:18.340
Sit down.

45:18.420 --> 45:19.900
Listen carefully, Marie,

45:19.980 --> 45:23.100
to the droppings of the
greatest brain of our day.

45:23.140 --> 45:24.500
Now piecing together
all the information

45:24.580 --> 45:25.620
I've received from London

45:25.700 --> 45:27.780
there are some unpleasant
deductions to be made.

45:27.820 --> 45:29.300
The power of the
Bishops is increasing

45:29.380 --> 45:30.300
like the pestilence,

45:30.380 --> 45:31.540
soon it will rival your own.

45:31.580 --> 45:32.980
Talk sense, Thomas,

45:33.020 --> 45:34.339
priests are always intriguing

45:34.340 --> 45:35.660
but I can crush
them anytime I wish.

45:35.700 --> 45:36.820
If you don't crush them now,

45:36.860 --> 45:37.980
in five year's time

45:38.060 --> 45:39.020
there will be two
Kings of England,

45:39.060 --> 45:40.220
the Archbishop of
Canterbury and you,

45:40.300 --> 45:42.900
in ten year's time
there will be only one.

45:46.260 --> 45:48.340
And it won't be me?

45:48.380 --> 45:50.300
I fear not.

45:50.340 --> 45:52.980
Grant to horse,
Thomas, to horse,

45:53.060 --> 45:55.020
war on the clergy,
death to the Archbishop.

45:55.100 --> 45:58.060
My Lord, I can't breathe.

45:58.140 --> 45:59.820
What are you doing down there,

45:59.900 --> 46:01.700
spying for the clergy?

46:01.740 --> 46:02.780
Be off with you.

46:02.860 --> 46:06.580
Put on your
clothes and go home.

46:06.620 --> 46:09.740
My Lord, am I to come
back to the camp tonight?

46:09.820 --> 46:10.660
Yes,

46:10.740 --> 46:11.580
no,

46:11.660 --> 46:12.700
I don't know.

46:12.740 --> 46:16.700
I'm thinking of priests
now, not you, go away.

46:16.780 --> 46:18.580
Wait, I'd rather be sure

46:18.660 --> 46:20.340
I'm getting
another one as good.

46:20.420 --> 46:22.140
Yes, come back tonight.

46:22.180 --> 46:23.540
You're adorable.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.180
You must always
tell them that,

46:27.260 --> 46:28.940
even when you pay.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.540
That's high politics too.

46:33.780 --> 46:36.100
Only one,

46:36.140 --> 46:38.180
it won't be me?

46:38.260 --> 46:40.980
It won't be you.

46:41.060 --> 46:43.020
But what will God say
if I attack his church,

46:43.100 --> 46:44.980
after all they're his bishops?

46:45.020 --> 46:47.380
We must manage the church.

46:47.420 --> 46:48.700
One can always come to a,

46:48.780 --> 46:54.420
sensible little
arrangement with God.

46:54.460 --> 46:57.300
Becket, you're a monster.

46:57.340 --> 46:58.460
You flatter me, My Lord.

46:58.500 --> 47:02.140
But please,
My Lord, dress quickly.

47:02.220 --> 47:06.740
It's, it's inelegant
for conquerors to be late.

47:06.820 --> 47:08.500
You're a monster.

47:36.900 --> 47:40.500
You see, they love us
dearly, these French.

47:40.580 --> 47:43.100
So they should,
we paid them enough.

47:43.180 --> 47:45.460
In that case, we
should have found some

47:45.540 --> 47:47.620
that didn't dress
out of a rag barrel.

47:53.100 --> 47:54.540
The rich are at home sulking.

47:54.620 --> 47:56.060
Supporters of
King Louis of France?

47:56.140 --> 47:58.420
No, it just
would've cost too much.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.700
That sounds real.

47:59.780 --> 48:01.220
Yes, we have soldiers
disguised in the crowd

48:01.300 --> 48:02.580
to encourage enthusiasm.

48:02.660 --> 48:04.820
Why must you destroy
all of my illusions?

48:04.860 --> 48:06.900
Because you should
have none, My Prince.

48:14.420 --> 48:15.820
What do you see?

48:15.900 --> 48:17.420
Reality.

48:19.500 --> 48:22.180
Stop here!

48:22.220 --> 48:23.540
The Bishop is waiting.

48:23.580 --> 48:24.900
As if it mattered what
I do with a Bishop

48:24.940 --> 48:26.140
whose city I've just taken.

48:26.220 --> 48:27.420
It matters.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.020
Am I the strongest,
or am I not?

48:29.100 --> 48:30.180
You are today,

48:30.260 --> 48:32.060
but one must never drive
one's enemy to despair,

48:32.100 --> 48:33.740
it makes him strong

48:33.820 --> 48:35.100
gentleness is better politics,

48:35.140 --> 48:36.660
it saps virility.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.940
A good occupational
force must never crush,

48:39.020 --> 48:41.740
it must corrupt.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.620
Make a note of the house.

48:44.700 --> 48:46.260
Oh, never mind.

48:52.860 --> 48:54.660
My Lord, the Bishop.

48:54.700 --> 48:56.220
Yes, papa.

48:56.300 --> 48:57.900
No, papa.

49:20.740 --> 49:22.180
Put your men at rest, Captain.

49:22.260 --> 49:24.020
Is this William, of Corbeil?

49:24.100 --> 49:25.300
Yes, Sire.

49:25.340 --> 49:26.660
I hardly recognized you

49:26.700 --> 49:28.740
without a tankard
covering your face.

49:28.820 --> 49:31.140
How did they pry
you away from it?

49:31.220 --> 49:34.300
I had urgent messages from
London for you, My Lord.

49:38.540 --> 49:39.820
It seems that God

49:39.900 --> 49:41.540
is on our side
after all, Thomas.

49:41.580 --> 49:43.020
What is that, My Prince?

49:43.100 --> 49:45.740
He's just recalled the
Archbishop of Canterbury

49:45.820 --> 49:49.940
to his bosom.

49:50.020 --> 49:52.500
That frail old man,

49:52.580 --> 49:57.060
he was the first Norman
to take an interest in me.

49:57.140 --> 49:58.900
God rest his soul.

49:58.940 --> 50:01.260
He will, he will

50:01.340 --> 50:02.620
and he'll be much
more use to God

50:02.700 --> 50:04.500
than he ever was to me.

50:15.060 --> 50:16.740
Thomas.

50:22.860 --> 50:26.900
An extraordinary idea
is creeping into my mind.

50:26.980 --> 50:30.940
A masterstroke,

50:31.020 --> 50:33.340
I'm suddenly
very intelligent.

50:33.420 --> 50:34.580
It probably comes
from making love

50:34.660 --> 50:36.180
to that French
girl last night.

50:36.260 --> 50:38.060
I'm subtle,

50:38.100 --> 50:39.860
I'm even profound.

50:39.940 --> 50:43.780
Oh, I'm so profound
it's making my head spin.

50:43.860 --> 50:45.980
Are you listening
to me, Thomas?

50:46.060 --> 50:47.980
I'm listening, My Prince.

50:48.060 --> 50:51.420
We need a new
Archbishop of Canterbury.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.980
I think there is
a man we can rely on.

50:55.060 --> 50:56.580
No matter who it is,

50:56.660 --> 50:58.460
once the Archbishop's
miter is on his head

50:58.500 --> 51:00.180
he will not longer
be on your side.

51:00.260 --> 51:03.100
But if the
Archbishop is my man,

51:03.180 --> 51:05.700
if Canterbury
is for the King,

51:05.780 --> 51:07.980
how could his power
possibly get in my way?

51:08.060 --> 51:10.700
My Lord,
we know your bishops,

51:10.780 --> 51:12.740
once enthroned at Canterbury,

51:12.820 --> 51:15.620
every one of them will
grow dizzy with power.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.900
Not this man.

51:17.980 --> 51:21.060
This is someone who doesn't
know what dizziness means,

51:21.140 --> 51:23.940
someone who
isn't afraid of God.

51:23.980 --> 51:25.860
I'm sorry to deprive
you of the French giris

51:25.940 --> 51:28.700
and the other
spoils of victory but,

51:28.780 --> 51:30.180
are you listening
to me, Thomas?

51:31.460 --> 51:33.020
You're leaving
for England tonight.

51:33.060 --> 51:35.500
On what mission, My Prince?

51:35.580 --> 51:37.340
You are going to
deliver a letter

51:37.420 --> 51:38.980
to all the bishops of England.

51:39.060 --> 51:40.020
Uh-huh.

51:40.100 --> 51:43.780
My royal edict nominating
you, Thomas Becket,

51:43.860 --> 51:46.580
Primate of England,

51:46.660 --> 51:48.860
Archbishop of Canterbury.

51:55.180 --> 51:58.340
Shut up.

51:58.380 --> 52:02.660
Thomas, I'm in deadly earnest.

52:02.740 --> 52:05.060
My Lord,

52:05.100 --> 52:07.780
don't do this.

52:07.820 --> 52:10.020
You have an odd way
of taking good news.

52:10.100 --> 52:11.980
I should think
you'd be triumphant.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.620
But I, I'm not even a priest.

52:14.700 --> 52:16.620
You're a deacon,

52:16.700 --> 52:18.300
you can be ordained priest

52:18.380 --> 52:21.140
and consecrated
Archbishop the next day.

52:21.220 --> 52:22.820
Have you considered
what the Pope would say?

52:22.860 --> 52:24.940
I'll pay his price.

52:28.660 --> 52:32.020
My Lord,

52:32.100 --> 52:36.020
this frightens me.

52:36.100 --> 52:39.260
I thought you had God in the
palm of your hand, Thomas.

52:42.380 --> 52:44.860
I beg of you,

52:44.940 --> 52:47.500
do not do this.

52:47.540 --> 52:50.100
You've never
disappointed me, Thomas,

52:50.180 --> 52:53.780
and you're the
only man I can trust.

52:53.860 --> 52:55.900
You'll leave for
England tonight.

53:01.780 --> 53:03.140
Becket?

53:19.580 --> 53:22.780
Thank you for returning
to us the keys of our city.

53:28.260 --> 53:30.460
The die is cast, Thomas,

53:30.540 --> 53:32.980
make the most of it.

53:33.060 --> 53:34.340
And if I know you,

53:34.420 --> 53:36.460
I'm sure you will.

54:26.340 --> 54:27.300
There you are.

54:27.340 --> 54:29.060
Thank you, My Lord.

54:36.460 --> 54:37.860
Thank you, My Lord.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.260
You're welcome,
it will keep you warm.

54:39.340 --> 54:40.740
He'll only sell it for drink.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.100
Then that will keep him warm.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.620
Yes, Your Grace.

54:43.700 --> 54:44.580
No, not Your Grace,

54:44.660 --> 54:46.740
I will not be consecrated
Archbishop until tomorrow.

54:46.820 --> 54:48.420
I'm sorry, Father.

54:48.500 --> 54:49.860
That is temporarily correct.

54:49.900 --> 54:50.980
You don't really intend

54:51.060 --> 54:52.580
to give away
your winter cloaks?

54:52.660 --> 54:54.380
Everything, has all
the gold plate been sold?

54:54.460 --> 54:56.900
Yes, the money from the
sales is in those purses.

54:56.980 --> 54:59.260
Excellent, bring me
the rest of the money.

54:59.340 --> 55:01.620
But Your Grace...
I mean, Father...

55:01.660 --> 55:03.340
Everything.

55:07.340 --> 55:09.900
Well, welcome to
Canterbury, My Lord Bishop,

55:09.980 --> 55:10.900
is anything wrong?

55:10.940 --> 55:13.140
May I ask what is
happening here?

55:13.180 --> 55:15.500
Go sell all that thou hast
and give it to the poor

55:15.580 --> 55:17.060
and thou shal't have
treasure in heaven.

55:17.140 --> 55:18.460
I doubt if the Lord, Jesus

55:18.500 --> 55:20.380
meant that to apply
to a Chancellor

55:20.420 --> 55:22.220
about to be
consecrated Archbishop.

55:22.300 --> 55:24.060
Perhaps then it's
a touch of vanity.

55:24.140 --> 55:25.300
A truly saintly man,

55:25.340 --> 55:27.540
I know would never
do all this in one day.

55:27.620 --> 55:29.300
Let us call it
the clumsy gesture

55:29.380 --> 55:30.820
of a spiritual gatecrasher.

55:30.900 --> 55:32.340
Most clever,

55:32.420 --> 55:34.540
an Archbishop who
gives all so dramatically

55:34.620 --> 55:37.060
to the people would be
most popular with them.

55:37.140 --> 55:38.300
Oh no, Folliot,

55:38.380 --> 55:40.980
I'm simply
enjoying all of this.

55:41.060 --> 55:43.100
I'm beginning to
believe he's not a

55:43.140 --> 55:45.380
sad God after all.

55:49.700 --> 55:51.780
Forgive me, I fear my
inexperienced methods

55:51.860 --> 55:54.180
will never meet
with your approval.

55:54.260 --> 55:57.060
I know that you cast
the only vote against me.

55:57.140 --> 56:00.060
In the end I gave way
to the King's wishes.

56:00.140 --> 56:01.740
I don't blame
your reluctance

56:01.820 --> 56:03.500
as Bishop of London
and senior churchman

56:03.580 --> 56:05.060
you should've
been Archbishop.

56:05.140 --> 56:06.780
Now to have to
consecrate me instead

56:06.860 --> 56:08.540
and place the
miter on my head.

56:08.620 --> 56:10.300
I have no choice.

56:10.380 --> 56:13.980
I'm only performing
my function as Bishop.

56:14.020 --> 56:15.460
I see you still wear the seal

56:15.540 --> 56:18.300
of the King's Chancellor.

56:18.380 --> 56:21.180
Yes, I will
continue to wear it,

56:21.260 --> 56:23.540
that and the
Archbishop's ring.

56:23.620 --> 56:26.220
You do not find
this inconsistent?

56:26.300 --> 56:27.740
No, God is best served

56:27.820 --> 56:30.500
when the two rest
side by side in harmony.

56:30.580 --> 56:32.060
These excessive
acts of humility

56:32.140 --> 56:35.980
will not compensate for
subservience to the crown.

56:36.020 --> 56:37.500
Thank you.

56:37.540 --> 56:40.020
We are both aware of the
delicacy of my position.

56:40.100 --> 56:42.820
Let us trust that God

56:42.900 --> 56:47.340
will find a solution for it.

56:47.420 --> 56:49.220
And now,

56:49.300 --> 56:50.740
since humility seems to be

56:50.820 --> 56:54.100
a little hard on the knees,

56:54.180 --> 56:56.020
I trust you will be
comfortable under our roof,

56:56.100 --> 56:58.020
My Lord Bishop.

57:12.580 --> 57:15.140
Dear Lord,

57:15.220 --> 57:16.500
I wish there was something

57:16.580 --> 57:19.060
I really regretted
parting with

57:19.140 --> 57:21.540
so that I might
offer it to you.

57:21.620 --> 57:23.540
But forgive me, Lord,

57:23.620 --> 57:26.180
it's like going on a holiday,

57:26.260 --> 57:31.660
I've never enjoyed myself
so much in my whole life.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.860
Lord,

57:33.940 --> 57:38.180
are you sure you're
not laughing at me?

57:38.220 --> 57:41.700
It all seems far too easy.

58:09.140 --> 58:12.700
It is a Bishop's
duty to pass judgment,

58:12.780 --> 58:14.060
to interpret,

58:14.140 --> 58:15.580
to consecrate,

58:15.620 --> 58:17.060
to ordain,

58:17.140 --> 58:19.340
to offer sacrifice,

58:19.420 --> 58:22.220
to baptize and to confirm.

58:28.900 --> 58:31.260
Let us pray beloved Brother,

58:31.340 --> 58:33.820
let the goodness
of Almighty God

58:33.900 --> 58:37.020
providing for the
well-being of his church,

58:37.100 --> 58:40.860
may bestow upon
this Bishop elect,

58:40.900 --> 58:43.820
the abundance of his grace

58:43.860 --> 58:46.340
through Christ our Lord,

58:46.420 --> 58:47.380
Amen.

59:02.820 --> 59:04.460
May these hands be anointed

59:04.500 --> 59:06.940
with hallowed oil,

59:07.020 --> 59:09.940
with the chrism
that sanctifies.

59:10.020 --> 59:13.060
Even as Samuel
anointed David,

59:13.100 --> 59:15.860
King and Prophet

59:15.940 --> 59:17.940
so may these hands

59:18.020 --> 59:21.260
be anointed and consecrated.

59:34.340 --> 59:35.940
Take this ring,

59:36.020 --> 59:38.380
token of the pledged word.

59:38.460 --> 59:40.260
Yours it is,

59:40.300 --> 59:43.260
donned with
unshakable fidelity

59:43.340 --> 59:46.020
to preserve and guard,

59:46.100 --> 59:48.260
in unblemished honor

59:48.340 --> 59:52.100
God's bride, the Holy Church.

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.180
Lord, on the head
of this Bishop

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.380
and champion of thine,

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:16.020
I put the helmet of
defense and salvation

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.780
that with forehead
thus adorned,

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.700
head armed with the horns
of both testaments,

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.780
he may appear fearsome

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.060
to the enemies of truth.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.220
His Grace, will
receive you here.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.940
It isn't every day
that a Saxon monk

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.660
has an audience
with an Archbishop.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.820
Open your eyes.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:53.820
You'll kiss his ring

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:54.860
and show respect to His Grace,

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.460
or you'll get my
foot on your backside.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.700
You're welcome to Canterbury.

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.700
Kneel to His Grace.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:09.580
I see our young Brother
is quite unchanged.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.380
Has he been
troublesome to his Abbott?

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.740
Stubborn as a mule, My Lord.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.060
Father Abbott tried kindness,

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.340
but in the end
had to have recourse

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.820
to bread and water,
even to the whip.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.260
Nothing has any effect.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.940
Except for a good
kick in the rump

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.300
if Your Grace will
pardon the expression.

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.900
Stand up straight.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.060
Pay attention to your Brother.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.660
As a rule, the sin of
pride stiffens a man's back.

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.780
Look me in the face.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.140
Look me in the face.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.500
Now,

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.860
what do you have
to say for yourself?

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.740
I see.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.300
Now Brothers, we
relieve you for the day

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.900
from your rule of abstinence.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.740
Go to our kitchen
before you depart

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.180
and I hope you'll do
justice to our cuisine.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.660
And this one?

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.300
We will keep him here with us.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:58.860
He's vicious, Your Grace?

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.580
We are not afraid.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.980
Well, now,

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.740
wouldn't you rather
have a Saxon Archbishop

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.380
than a Norman one?

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.740
I hope I won't
regret sending for you.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.820
Why did you?

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.660
I'm not sure.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.380
Perhaps in a young,
intemperate way,

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.380
yours is a voice that
is good for me to hear.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.200
Then why...

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.100
But please, not too often

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.860
and not too loud Brother John.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.060
You betrayed your Saxon race,

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.900
now you betray God.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.860
Perhaps you will succeed
in teaching me humility,

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.700
it's a virtue I've
never really mastered.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.180
Enter.

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.660
Your Grace, Bishop Folliot
has just arrived from London,

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.540
he wishes to speak
to you urgently.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.060
Well, My Lord
Bishop, what is it?

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.300
But, Your Grace?

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.380
You may speak freely,

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.500
Brother John is
in our confidence.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.700
What is it?

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.900
Your Grace, I have a most
serious matter to report,

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.180
which requires your
immediate intervention.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.180
Proceed.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.820
A parish priest in
Lord Gilbert's domain,

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.140
who is accused of
debauching a young girl,

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.820
has been seized by
His Lordships soldiers

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.220
and dragged before
the civil courts.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.220
Is the priest guilty?

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.340
That is immaterial.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.900
As a consecrated
minister of God

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.060
he can only be tried

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.460
by our ecclesiastical courts.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:23.740
You must demand his release

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.660
into church
custody immediately.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.580
The principle is a vital one.

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.340
Does the King know of this?

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.740
He knows, but he
turns a deaf ear.

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.580
Lord Gilbert is his friend.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.940
I'm also a friend
of King Henry's.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.660
As Chancellor
you are his friend.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.780
But I wear the miter now.

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.020
You also wear the
great seal of England

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.100
and I warned you,

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:48.380
you could never
do so honorably.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.860
It is fortunate that I do.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.660
I will plead our
case to the King.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.820
I did not come here to
ask you to plead a case.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.860
I'm asking you to
defend a principle

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:02.340
and you'd better do so
quickly, Your Grace.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.700
Thank you for your warning.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.180
We appreciate your
efforts to chart the course

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:10.060
you would naturally
have followed

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.180
had you become Archbishop.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.420
At least, Your Grace,

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:14.860
I could never
have been accused

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.380
of divided loyalties.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.940
Should I go now?

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.140
Can I go?

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.500
No.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.340
See who's outside.

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.940
This is
Brother Philip, Your Grace.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.620
He's come with a message
for the Bishop of London.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.700
I told him he just left

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.060
but now he
insists on seeing you.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.620
Your Grace,

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.060
I wouldn't have dreamed
of disturbing you but...

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.060
It's you who are
disturbed, Brother Philip.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.580
What is it?

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.540
I believe My Lord Bishop
of London came to you

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.180
to demand the custody
of the accused priest.

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.860
Yes.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.260
The priest is dead.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.420
Dead?

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.060
Yes.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.140
He tried to escape

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.900
but Lord Gilbert's
soldiers caught him

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.900
and in the presence of
his Lordship, killed him.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:05.980
Thank you, Brother Philip,

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.780
you may retire.

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.100
Leave us now, Brother John.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.700
My Lord Jesus,

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:32.140
I find it difficult
to talk to you.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.420
What can I say?

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500
I, who have
turned away from you

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:43.260
so often with indifference

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.620
I have been
a stranger to prayer,

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.260
undeserving of your friendship

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:51.020
and your love.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.540
I've been without honor

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.859
and feel unworthy.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:58.740
I am a weak and
shallow creature,

01:08:58.779 --> 01:09:00.100
clever in only
in the second rate

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:05.140
and woridly arts seeking
my comfort and pleasure.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.660
I gave my love,

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.859
such as it was elsewhere,

01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:12.700
putting service
to my earthly king

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:15.220
before my duty to you.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.939
But now,

01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:19.460
they have made me
the shepherd of your flock

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.700
and guardian of your church.

01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:25.819
Please, Lord, teach me now

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:28.060
how to serve you
with all my heart,

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.020
to know at last
what it really is to love,

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.180
to adore.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.939
So that I may
worthily administer

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.420
your kingdom here upon earth

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.580
and find my true honor

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.020
in observing your divine will.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:51.180
Please, Lord,

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.340
make me worthy.

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.340
You are a creature
of extremes,

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.860
aren't you, Brother John.

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.100
Get up.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.420
Forgive me.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.220
I didn't know,

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.460
I never realized.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.980
Nor did I.

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.780
Get up.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:45.420
You were very good at
admonishing an Archbishop.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.380
Do you think you
could talk to a king?

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:48.780
Yes.

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.180
Good.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.940
Then you will
memorize what I write.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.220
Henry?

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.020
Henry?

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.500
What is it mother?

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.620
Why do you keep
gazing out of the window?

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.860
Becket won't come you know,

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.900
he's much too busy

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.660
giving money to the poor

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.820
and fitting
sandals on beggars.

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.580
I never liked him
as an adventurer,

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.860
but now that he puts
on the airs of a saint,

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.220
he certainly keeps himself

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.620
in splendid isolation

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.300
since you made
him Archbishop.

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.180
He's in retreat.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.500
It's part of the ritual.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.780
Anyway, I don't need

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:41.100
to be reassured
by his presence.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.580
He's my friend.

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:43.900
More is the pity.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:46.740
He has a strange way
of showing gratitude.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:47.860
Your friend,

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.100
you mean you went to
the whorehouses together.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.660
It was he who lured you away

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.380
from the duties
you owed to me.

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.780
Madam,
in matters of debauchery

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.020
it was I who lured him

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.060
and I didn't need
anyone to lure me

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.980
away from the
duties I owe you.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.700
I made you four children
very conscientiously,

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.340
thank the Lord
my duty is done.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.180
I pray heaven he
stays away from you.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.140
When you realize
how he has used you,

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.340
you may appreciate the
joys of family life again.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.580
The joys of family life
are limited, madam,

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.180
to be perfectly
frank, you bore me,

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.980
you and your
everlasting backbiting.

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:27.940
Stop this.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.940
And this eternal
tatting of yours.

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.340
In God's name how long does
it take to make a tapestry

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.260
and it's mediocre
beyond belief.

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.780
One performs
according to one's gifts.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.420
Yes.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.540
Shut up, the lot of you!

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.660
Which one are you?

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:03.780
Henry the III.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.540
Not yet, sir,

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:08.980
number two is in
the best of health.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:12.260
A fine way you bring up
your children, madam.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.980
Do you see yourself
as regent already?

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.660
No wonder I shun your bed,

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.060
it's not amusing to make
love to one's own widow.

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.620
Who's that?

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.540
A messenger

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.260
from Canterbury

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.300
if you can spare the time
from bullying your children.

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.820
Messenger?

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.020
Is your master ill?

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.500
No, Your Highness,

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.140
I have a message
from His Grace.

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.340
A message?

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.020
These are Becket's words.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.140
"Whereas men at arms
of the Lord Gilbert

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.380
under his orders
and in his presence

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:54.140
have seized and killed
a priest of the church,

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.420
I Becket,

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Archbishop of Canterbury,

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.300
Primate of England,

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.620
do now ask that Your Highness

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.100
in accordance with
the law of the Realm

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.100
apprehend Lord Gilbert

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.860
and charge him with
the crime of murder."

01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.500
Well, my son,

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.140
now you have heard
from your friend.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.300
Get out!

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.100
Get out, both of you!

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.540
Take your royal
vermin with you!

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.740
Your Highness,

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.780
is there a reply
for the Archbishop?

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.060
Your Grace.

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:46.900
Yes?

01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:48.460
The King is here.

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.260
Are you certain?

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.940
He came mounted and alone,

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:56.020
but I'm sure it's he.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.340
My Prince.

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.900
Why did you send a messenger?

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.580
Canterbury's only
five hours from London.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.260
I've just ridden it in four,

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.340
I'm frozen stiff.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:21.300
Would you like some wine?

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.300
No.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.780
Give me a reason.

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:25.860
Why did you send a messenger?

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.140
What answer did you give him?

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:31.420
You've arrived
here before he has.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:36.460
I detect ill,
devious Becket here.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:39.140
What game are
you playing, Thomas?

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.980
No game, My Prince.

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:48.420
Lord Gilbert
murdered a priest.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.900
I want the guilty punished.

01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.060
The guilty of what?

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:54.060
This priest was
a scandal to his parish.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.620
That was never proved.

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:56.900
Gilbert should've
handed the accused

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.420
over to the church
for process of law.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.460
If guilty, we would have
determined his punishment.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.180
I am the law.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:03.340
Gilbert will recourse to me,

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.100
I gave him leave
to arrest this priest.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.540
I can't allow any of my clergy

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.620
to be thrown into prison

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.820
and tried by the
civil authorities.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:09.980
Neither can I stand by

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.740
and let my
priests be murdered.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.140
You?

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.220
You can't allow?

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.260
You can't stand by?

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:21.740
Are you taking yourself
seriously as Archbishop?

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.020
I am the
Archbishop, My Prince.

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:26.300
By my grace.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.380
Are you demented,
you're Chancellor of England,

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.860
you're mine.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.220
I'm also the Archbishop

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.580
and you have introduced
me to deeper obligations.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.860
And if I won't charge Gilbert?

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.420
I can't force you,

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.940
but there is always
a final judgment

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.660
beyond the King's justice.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:54.860
Oh that, Lord Gilbert
will face his fate

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:57.580
on the day of judgment,
as we all will.

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.820
I'm sure he'll have a
great deal more to answer for

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.220
than killing
a felonious priest.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.420
Lord Gilbert will
come to that judgment

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.100
already damned, Sire.

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:09.020
I intend to excommunicate him.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.180
You are demented.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.260
Don't you understand

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.780
that when you attack
my nobles, you attack me,

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.500
and when you attack me,
you attack England!

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.100
There is more to
England than the crown.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.140
You must learn to face
that eventually, My Prince.

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.340
Damn you, don't lecture me!

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.940
You once told me

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.260
you didn't know what honor
was, and I laughed at you.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.540
But now to betray me,

01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.980
to challenge my power.

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.860
I do not seek
power, My Prince.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.460
It is only that
I finally discovered

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.420
a real honor to defend.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.500
Whose honor?

01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:45.340
Whose honor is
greater than the King's?

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.740
The honor of God.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.620
Forgive me.

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.580
Hmm,

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.180
you give the lions
of England back to me,

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:24.620
like a little boy who
doesn't want to play anymore.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.500
I would have gone to war

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.380
with all England's
might behind me

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.100
and even against
England's interest

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.620
to defend you, Thomas.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.260
I would have
given away my life

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.660
laughingly for you,

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.819
only I loved you

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.420
and you didn't love me

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.180
that's the difference.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.380
Stay away.

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:54.900
But thank you for this
last gift as you desert me.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.300
Now I shall learn to be alone.

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:46.700
Bishop.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.500
What do you want, Philip?

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:53.980
Your Majesty,

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.100
alone without an escort?

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:59.500
The King nevertheless.

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.940
Bishop, I wish to confess.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.020
The King has
his own confessor.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.380
It is an important
court prerogative.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.900
Don't be nervous, Bishop.

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:11.460
I'm not asking for absolution.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.780
I have something far worse

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:15.100
than a sin on my conscience.

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.020
A mistake,

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:20.020
a crass mistake.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.540
I ordered you
to vote for Becket

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.060
in the election at Canterbury.

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:25.660
I repent of it.

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.700
I bowed beneath
the royal hand.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.140
Very reluctantly, I know.

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:31.620
I'm told this compromise
with your conscience

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.180
made you seriously
ill afterwards.

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.540
God cured me.

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.220
Very good of him.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:40.660
You wear his uniform
and have his ear.

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.060
He's let me fall ill

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.140
without lifting a finger

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.300
and I must cure myself.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.340
I did not know of this...

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:50.740
I have the
Archbishop on my stomach,

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.940
a big, hard lump

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.500
I shall have to vomit back.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.060
I think you are a man
one can talk to, Bishop.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.780
I believe I misjudged you,

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.540
friendship blinded me.

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:03.900
Is the King's friendship

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.940
for Thomas Becket
dead, Your Highness?

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:07.700
Yes, Bishop,
it died quite suddenly,

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.460
a sort of heart failure.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.780
A curious phenomenon,
Your Highness,

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.300
but quite frequent.

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.420
I hate Becket now.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.140
I hate him,

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.180
as much as you
are jealous of him.

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:21.980
He's like an animal
tearing my guts,

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.420
I can't bear it anymore.

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:28.500
I shall have to
turn it loose on him.

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:30.740
But I am the King

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:34.060
and my office
stands in my way.

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.980
I need someone to help me.

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:38.940
My only interest
is for the church.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.780
Oh, come, Bishop.

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.820
We're alone and
the church is empty.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.300
The church is never empty.

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.500
The little red lamp
burns in the chapel

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:52.740
signifying God's presence
in the tabernacle.

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:56.500
Do you take me for one of
your sheep, Holy Pastor?

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:57.700
I like playing games,

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.620
but only with
boys of my own age.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:03.260
The one for whom that
little red lamp burns

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:05.020
has seen into
your innermost heart

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.740
and mine a long time ago.

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.580
Of my hatred
of Thomas Becket

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:12.140
and your envy of him,

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:14.900
he knows all there is to know.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.580
Strange, I'd always
taken Your Highness,

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.020
for a perennial adolescent

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.740
who cared only
for his pleasures.

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.460
One can be wrong
about people, Bishop,

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.820
I made the same mistake.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.580
Now, if it could be proved

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:28.180
that Becket had committed some

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.300
gross impropriety
as Chancellor,

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:34.380
say embezzlement,

01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.340
what would the church do?

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.300
If that were established,

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:40.140
I say if,

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.460
the Bishops could
legally dissolve

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.900
their allegiance to him

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:45.460
pending their
report to the pope.

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.660
And beyond that?

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.900
You,

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.860
you would go beyond that?

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.900
The whole way.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.340
In his guilt,

01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:55.180
if he were found guilty,

01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.340
he would then be
charged under canon law.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.380
And the penalty?

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.860
That would be for
Your Majesty to decide.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.340
Thomas.

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:06.380
You love him don't you?

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.700
You still love him.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.140
That impostor,
that Saxon guttersnipe,

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:12.260
that mitered hog.

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.260
Hold your tongue, Priest.

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.060
All I confided to you

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.980
was my hate, not my love.

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.220
For England's sake,

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.020
you'll help me get rid of him,

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:27.020
but don't ever
insult him to my face.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.420
He will be accused,

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.260
and you will play
your proper part.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.740
According to law.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:44.060
I would spit,

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.580
if I were not
in God's house.

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:05.940
My Brothers,

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:06.940
as you have been told

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.220
your presence
here is voluntary.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.500
If any of you have
second thoughts

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:15.460
you may retire now.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.260
Thank you for attending.

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.020
Good day, My Lords.

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.620
I did not expect to
see you at Canterbury.

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:50.780
Do you still disagree
with my decision?

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:53.860
Your Grace, can nothing
persuade you to delay?

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:57.100
Oh, yes, the King's
arrest of Lord Gilbert

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:59.540
on the charge of
sacrilegious murder.

01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:00.860
There will be an arrest

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.580
but not Lord Gilbert's.

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:04.940
The sheriff of London
is waiting in the sacristy.

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.140
He has orders to summon you

01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.860
before the King's
grand justicer,

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.460
the instant you pronounce
the excommunication.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.620
How curious, on what charge?

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:13.820
Embezzlement.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.020
The King finds that there are

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.020
large sums of money
missing from the treasury

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.620
during your
administration as Chancellor?

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.820
How much?

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:24.820
Forty thousand
pounds in fine gold.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.260
There was never that much
gold in the whole treasury.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.140
I beg of you do not do this.

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.340
You will strike a blow

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:32.100
that will split church
and state for a generation.

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.220
If I do not strike it now

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.540
the church as we know it

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.620
will not survive a generation.

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:38.580
God will see that it survives.

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.740
No, the Kingdom of
God must be defended

01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.700
like any other Kingdom.

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.140
Gentlemen,

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:51.580
it is a supreme irony

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.460
that the woridly Becket,

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.660
the profligate and libertine

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.500
should find himself

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:00.580
standing here at this moment.

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:02.580
But here he is

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.900
in spite of himself.

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:07.500
But the King for good or ill,

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:10.300
chose to pass the burden
of the church onto me

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:12.060
and now I must carry it.

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.260
I've rolled up my sleeves,

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.860
and taken the
church on my back.

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:23.260
Nothing will ever make
me set it down again.

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:26.660
Now, Lords,

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.860
if you will forgive me.

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:06.180
Lord Gilbert,

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:08.140
Baron of England, by
the grace of His Majesty,

01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.220
King Henry the II,

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.820
seized upon the
person of a priest

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.300
of the holy church

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:15.820
and unlawfully did
hold him in custody.

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.300
Furthermore,

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:19.020
in the presence
of Lord Gilbert

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.740
and by his command,

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:22.340
his men seized
upon this priest

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.060
when he tried to escape

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:26.140
and put him to death.

01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:29.900
This is the sin of
murder and sacrilege.

01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:31.140
In that,

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.500
Lord Gilbert has rendered

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.460
no act of contrition
or repentance

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:37.060
and is at the moment
at liberty in the land,

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.620
we do here and
now separate him

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.820
from the precious body
and blood of Christ

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.540
and from the society
of all Christians.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.580
We exclude him from
our Holy Mother Church

01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:50.220
and all her sacraments

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:53.460
in heaven, or on earth.

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.140
We declare him excommunicate

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:57.900
and anathema.

01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:01.260
We cast him into
the outer darkness,

01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:04.300
we judge him
damned with the devil

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.100
and his fallen angels

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:08.180
and all the reprobate

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.020
to eternal fire

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:12.900
and everlasting pain.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.900
So be it.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.020
As the Lord
Sheriff of London,

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:12.260
I'm commanded to summon you,

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.340
Thomas Becket,
to the King's court

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.780
on the charges
herein set forth,

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.020
stamped with the King's seal.

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.420
I Robert de Beaumont,

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.300
Duke of Leicester,

01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.180
Grand Justicer of the Realm,

01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:45.900
do now summon Thomas Becket

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.740
to this court of law,

01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.380
for the third and last time.

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.100
Thomas Becket, step forward.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.740
He's doomed, isn't he?

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:08.060
Yes.

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:09.740
At last.

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:12.820
I forbid you to gloat.

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.220
At seeing your enemy perish.

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.860
Why not?

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.460
Becket is my enemy

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.620
but in the human balance

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:22.980
traitor that he is

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.620
and naked as
his mother made him,

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.580
he's worth 100 of you madam,

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.420
with your crown
and your jewels

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.180
and your august uncle the
emperor into the bargain.

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.700
I'm forced to fight
him now and crush him

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.900
but at least he gave
me with open hands

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:38.300
everything that is
at all good in me,

01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:39.660
and you have never
given me anything

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.340
but your coping mediocrity

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:42.820
and your everlasting obsession

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.220
with your puny little person

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.660
and what you
thought was due to it!

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.980
That's why
I forbid you to smile

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:51.180
while Becket
is being destroyed!

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.860
I gave you my youth,

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:53.980
I gave you your children.

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.980
I don't like my children!

01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.420
And as for your youth,

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.860
that withered flower

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.820
pressed between the
pages of a hymn book

01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.340
since you were 12 years old

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:06.660
with its watery blood

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:08.900
and stale insipid scent,

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:12.780
you can bid farewell
to that without a tear.

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.380
Your body was an
empty desert, Madame,

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.380
which duty forced
me to wander in alone.

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.980
But you have never
been a wife to me,

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:23.300
and Becket was my friend,

01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.700
red blooded,

01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:27.340
generous and full of strength.

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.460
Oh, my Thomas.

01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:30.580
And I?

01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:33.620
I have given you
nothing I suppose?

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:39.300
Life, yes.

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.060
Thank you.

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.580
But after that
I never saw you

01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.700
except in a passageway
on your way to a ball,

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.820
or in your crown
and ermine mantle

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.460
10 minutes before
official ceremonies

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:51.460
when you were forced
to tolerate my presence.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:56.340
No! No one on this earth has
ever loved me except Becket!

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:57.660
Call him back then,

01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:59.620
absolve him if he loves you,

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.460
give him back his power,

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.500
but do something.

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.980
I am.

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.020
I'm learning to be alone.

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:52.580
By the authority granted me,

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.980
I, Robert de Beaumont,

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.580
servant of the crown,

01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:58.060
do now before this council,

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:00.500
charge Thomas Becket
with the crimes of...

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:04.180
Robert.

01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.460
I charge you, Thomas Becket...

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.660
Robert de Beaumont,

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:08.580
hear me for the
sake of your soul,

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:11.740
which is in
the gravest danger.

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:12.940
All in this assembly

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.580
know how faithfully I've
served My Lord the King.

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:17.980
It was he who willed
that I be Archbishop

01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:21.580
and it was for love of
him alone that I accepted.

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:23.700
I am innocent
of any wrongdoing

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:24.900
in my administration

01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:26.540
of the King's treasury
as Chancellor,

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.260
or at any other time.

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:32.140
I therefore refuse to plea
to these trumped up charges.

01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.860
I will be judged

01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.900
by the Pope alone,

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.180
to whom before you all

01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:38.820
I now appeal and place myself

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.060
and my church
under his protection.

01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.340
As head of the
Church of England

01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.900
and as your spiritual father,

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.940
I forbid you to
pass judgment on me.

01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.660
I command you

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:54.780
and all who would charge
me to hold your peace

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.900
on pain of endangering

01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.140
your immortal souls.

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:09.940
Well played, Thomas.

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.180
Do you think you can

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:20.620
carry this off
indefinitely you fool?

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:23.380
We are all God's
fools, My Lord.

01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:25.500
Becket,

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.380
you are a liar!

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.940
You are a traitor!

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:31.260
Sheathe your sword Morville

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.340
before you impale
your soul upon it!

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:54.740
It's funny,

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.700
it's too funny.

01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:59.220
He's made mincemeat of them.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:02.540
I'm surrounded by fools!

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:05.020
Becket is the only
intelligent man

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.940
in my kingdom
and he's against me!

01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:16.780
Your Highness,
it was impossible...

01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:18.060
Shut up,

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.620
get to your feet.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.660
Did you hear him,

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:22.220
he appeals to the Pope.

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:24.180
If he gains the
Pope's ear, Bishop,

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.660
we may find the
entire kingdom

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:27.420
under Papal interdict.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
I could be
excommunicated myself.

01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:30.860
But, Your Highness,
I do not think that...

01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:35.700
I want no more thinking!

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:39.060
Becket must not
cross the channel.

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.100
King Louis of France

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:42.820
would be the first to
help him get to the Pope.

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:46.140
The Archbishop must not
leave England, see to it.

01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:50.020
From now on, Bishop,

01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.060
it is total war.

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:14.100
Psssst...

01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.540
My French Knight

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.780
takes your English Bishop.

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.340
Your Majesty's adroit.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:35.100
Pardon, Sire.

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:40.500
To snug.

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:44.900
Why do all tailors want
to strangle one's armpits?

01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:47.860
Your Majesty, the English
ambassador's extraordinary

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:50.100
insist that I convey
their compliments.

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:51.540
They've already done that.

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.660
I'll see them when I'm ready,

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.420
that's my job.

01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:57.220
They wish respectfully Sire,

01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:58.860
to call your
attention to the fact

01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.860
that they have been
waiting for three days.

01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.780
Let them wait,
that's their job.

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.220
Ambassadors are paid to
pace about in anterooms

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.420
especially in these
times of uneasy peace.

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.780
But they have an
urgent communication

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.460
from Henry of England, Sire.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:11.820
The King of England
and his ambassadors

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.300
can drown themselves
in what they are

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.500
impertinent enough to
call their English channel.

01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:19.060
But, Your Majesty, the
extradition of a criminal

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:20.340
is a courtesy due

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:22.380
from one crowned
head to another.

01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.100
My dear man,
crowned heads are free

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:25.860
to play a little
game of courtesy,

01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:29.220
but nations owe
one another none.

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.260
Oh.

01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:34.620
All right, show them
in, show them in.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:36.540
No, you may stay.

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.900
The ambassadors can
share our attention

01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:39.420
with our tailor.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.060
It will demonstrate
to the English

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:43.860
that exact social
status of our court.

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.060
May I be permitted to
present to, Your Majesty,

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:49.860
the two envoys extraordinary

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:52.100
from His Highness,
Henry of England,

01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:53.940
His Grace,
the Bishop of London

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:56.380
and Robert de Beaumont,
Duke of Leicester.

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.140
Welcome My Lords.

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.180
Fresh from England?

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.460
How is our good King Henry?

01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:03.660
He was well, Your Majesty,

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.820
when we left him
two weeks ago.

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:09.100
Two weeks to cross
the channel, gentlemen?

01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:12.660
We have been waiting upon
Your Majesty, for three days.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.820
Why was I not informed?

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:15.940
Girot.

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:17.420
Your Majesty?

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.220
See what I have
to contend with.

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.060
But perhaps I can
make it up to you.

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:22.660
Would you permit
me to furnish you

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.740
with some French garments

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.340
made by our craftsmen here,

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.020
it will only take two weeks?

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.740
We thank, Your Majesty,

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:31.740
but we have urgent
business in Rome.

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:33.580
Too bad.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.260
Well, is there anything
else I can do for you?

01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:37.500
I wish to deliver a message

01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.140
from Henry, King of England

01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:42.100
to his friend Louis,
King of the French.

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:43.299
We are all ears.

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.220
He wishes you to know...

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.620
Oh, just one moment.

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.420
Yes, do continue.

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.340
He wishes you to know
that Thomas Becket,

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.980
Archbishop of Canterbury,

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.860
has been found
guilty of treason

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.180
and has forthwith
fled his kingdom.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:59.580
He therefore entreats you

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.100
not to allow this criminal

01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.460
to reside within
your territories,

01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.460
nor to permit
any of your vassals

01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:08.220
to give counsel
or support to him.

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:10.460
He solemnly declares
that your enemies

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.580
would receive none from him,

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:14.660
nor from his subjects.

01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.460
Henry, King of England,

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.300
Duke of Normandy.

01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:24.180
Gentlemen, we have
listened most attentively

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.300
to your sovereign's
gracious request,

01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:28.140
and we shall
shortly be drafting

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.540
a formal reply to it.

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:31.700
In the meantime, however,

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.780
we can only express
our astonishment.

01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.260
No news has reached us

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:36.580
of the Archbishop
of Canterbury's

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.900
presence in our domains.

01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:39.260
But Sire, we have word

01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:40.980
that he is in your domains.

01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:43.740
He's taken refuge in
the Abbey of San Martin

01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:45.260
My Lord Bishop,
we flatter ourselves

01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.900
there is some
order in our kingdom.

01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:47.980
If he were there,

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:50.780
we should most certainly
had been informed.

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:02.700
Bring in Thomas Becket.

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:29.020
Rise, Thomas Becket,

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.780
and greet us as the
Primate of England.

01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:32.260
The bow would've been enough

01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.460
and if I know my etiquette

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:34.820
you were entitled to

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:38.140
a slight nod of
the head from me.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.820
That's done.

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.420
I might also be
required to kiss the ring

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.300
if this visit
were an official one

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:45.140
but I am under the
impression that isn't.

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.740
No, Sire.

01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:48.220
I'm on an exile.

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.620
That too is an
important title in France.

01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:53.340
I'm told you are
a dangerous one.

01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:54.460
I'm afraid so, Sire.

01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:55.340
How delightful,

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:57.220
shall we discuss
it in private.

01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:01.660
We enjoy danger Becket,

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.420
it keeps us alive.

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:04.700
Do you value candor?

01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:05.620
I do, Sire.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.220
Then let me tell you that
were you a French official

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:09.180
I might have kept you
into prison myself.

01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.180
For the moment, however,

01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.580
we are pleased to grant
you our royal protection.

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.980
I humbly thank
you, Your Majesty,

01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:15.100
but I'm bound to tell you

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.380
that I cannot buy your favor

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:18.380
with any act
hostile to my country.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.860
You do us an injustice,
that was understood.

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.420
I believe that in
the past however,

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.180
you have been no stranger

01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:28.380
to the art of
political maneuver.

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:29.620
That is true, Sire.

01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.020
Well, speaking frankly,

01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:34.260
you suit our purpose
in our chess game.

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:36.220
England is splitting
into the Henry camp

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.780
and the Becket camp

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.220
and that suits us admittible.

01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.580
We ask nothing further of you,

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:45.540
but, there is always a but,

01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:46.940
as I'm sure you are aware?

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.060
I am aware.

01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.860
I am responsible only for
France's interest, Becket.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.860
Unfortunately, I cannot
afford to shoulder

01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.180
those of heaven as well.

01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.380
For the moment it suits me

01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:58.540
to shelter any fugitive
from Henry's court.

01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:01.300
His recent impertinence
in claiming and capturing

01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.700
some of our frontier towns

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.500
must be well known
to you, Thomas,

01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.300
since you more than
distinguished yourself

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.540
in several of
these engagements?

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:11.020
In a month or so, however,

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:12.300
my dealings with Henry

01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:14.340
may require a
different tactic.

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:15.860
I might even be obliged

01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.500
to ask you to leave France.

01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.660
I hope to have a solution
to such a dilemma.

01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:21.940
Oh?

01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.940
I intend to go onto Rome

01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:26.460
to put my case
before the Holy Father,

01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.340
if you will give
me safe conduct.

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.060
You shall have it, of course,

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:31.900
you're the ideal guest.

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:34.020
But might I be permitted
to give you a word of advice.

01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.220
I would appreciate it.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:36.900
The Pope is a most holy man,

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.820
but like so many
lofty personages

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.140
he is surrounded by men

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.940
of a somewhat inferior stamp.

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:43.740
They need money

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:47.900
and King Henry might
be willing to provide it.

01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.900
Keep your eyes open.

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:55.060
I will.

01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:57.060
But permit me to
show you my aviary.

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:17.380
That man Becket smacks
of too much sincerity.

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.660
A practice that is
most disconcerting.

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:20.740
Fiddlesticks.

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:22.300
Sincerity is a
form of strategy

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.500
just like any other.

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:26.220
In a pinch I have been
known to use it myself.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:27.860
The trouble is,
if your opponent starts

01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:30.500
being sincere at the
same time you do,

01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:32.660
then the game becomes
horribly confusing.

01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.260
Shh.

01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:06.300
I assure you, Your Holiness,

01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:07.820
it's a simple matter.

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:10.380
No, no, no, Zambelli,

01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.900
I don't agree,

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.660
it is impossible.

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.580
If we take the money
from King Henry,

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:19.980
I cannot possibly
receive Becket.

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:23.020
Receive the money from
the King, very Holy Father,

01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.180
and receive the
Archbishop too.

01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.540
The one will
neutralize the other.

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.020
You know what they say,

01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:31.260
Becket is going to ask me?

01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:32.860
No, Holy Father.

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:36.180
Zambelli, don't play
the fox with me.

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.300
It was you who told me.

01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.700
I beg your pardon,
Holy Father.

01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:41.020
I had forgotten,

01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:44.220
or rather as Your Holiness
asked me the question

01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:46.380
I thought you had forgotten

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.900
and so I took a chance and...

01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:50.339
Zambelli,

01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:53.940
if you start out maneuvering
yourself to no purpose,

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:56.820
we'll be here all night.

01:46:56.900 --> 01:46:59.220
Well, bring him in.

01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:14.820
His Holiness
will receive you now.

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.660
I'm sorry to be
importunate, Your Holiness,

01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:44.980
but time is running out
and my course concerns

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.660
the very life of the
church in England.

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.420
I know, I know,

01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.660
and your cause is worthy

01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.660
but nevertheless, Becket,

01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:55.660
the church must seek
to exist peacefully

01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:58.660
within the framework
of the state.

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:00.540
I sought that with
desperation, Your Holiness.

01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:02.060
Precisely, Becket.

01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:04.580
You are new to God's service

01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.300
and perhaps for that reason

01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:09.140
you were somewhat hot headed

01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:12.500
and intemperate
in your methods.

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:15.300
You have proved
your moral worth,

01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:17.060
but you have also split

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.020
the church in England
into two parties

01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.660
and that is regrettable.

01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:25.780
Holy Father, I fear
this may be true

01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:29.620
and it has given
me much agony.

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:32.420
If I'm guilty,
if my judgment was wrong,

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.100
then I am most
sincerely repentant.

01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:38.020
unfortunately that
doesn't solve the problem.

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.220
Holy Father,

01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:45.300
relieve me of the
title of Archbishop,

01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:47.020
let me be an ordinary priest.

01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.100
All right, done.

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.420
Zambelli.

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:55.620
Why do your request this?

01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:58.660
Then, Your Holiness, could
make a free and open decision.

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.540
The protection of my position
as head of the English church

01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.420
may prove an embarrassment

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.820
I would like to relive you of.

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:07.460
No, that would mean

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:11.100
our total surrender
to the state.

01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:14.500
You will maintain
your status as Archbishop

01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.820
but you will, for the present,

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:22.420
maintain it in
a monastic retreat.

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:26.220
Where do you wish
us to send you?

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:29.700
To the Abbey of
San Martin in France.

01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:32.220
I ask only that
my former servant,

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:35.580
Brother John
be allowed to accompany me.

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.420
Of course,

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.860
God grant you
peace, Thomas Becket.

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.180
That man is obviously

01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:05.380
an abyss of ambition.

01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:07.100
How long a retreat?

01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:09.620
A very long retreat.

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.940
I wouldn't count on it.

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:15.620
Wait till he tastes
the food at the monastery.

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:41.940
You look concerned,
Your Grace?

01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:43.380
Is something wrong?

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:44.980
No, Brother John.

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:46.580
You are unhappy here?

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:49.180
No, perhaps I'm too happy.

01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:50.940
Can I help?

01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:53.740
No, only God can help.

01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:29.580
Lord,

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:34.460
what do you
really want me to do?

01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:36.260
To remain here, a poor monk

01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:38.980
in simplicity of spirit,

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:42.780
is it a path to bring
me nearer to you?

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:44.580
Or is to easy a way,

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:48.340
perhaps even a luxury?

01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:52.300
The path to holiness
in this monastery

01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:55.220
is too effortless.

01:51:55.260 --> 01:52:01.220
I think it would be too
easy to buy you like this.

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:03.500
Bargain price.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:10.780
It has pleased you
to make me Archbishop

01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:14.020
and to set me
like a solitary pawn

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:17.940
face to face with the
King on the chessboard.

01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:19.900
I think you mean me
to defend your honor,

01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:20.980
peacefully if I can

01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:25.460
with argument
and with compromise

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.820
and if I cannot

01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:30.940
then with the full
challenge of my office

01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:32.500
and the soaring force

01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:37.580
of what I know to be right.

01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:40.300
So,

01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:43.420
I shall take up
the miter again

01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.340
and the golden cope

01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:49.620
and the great silver cross

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:52.020
and I shall go back

01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:53.380
and fight with the weapons

01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:55.780
it has pleased you to give me.

01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:01.260
All the rest,

01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:07.100
thy will be done.

01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:26.300
Look, Thomas,

01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:27.940
your King awaits you.

01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:34.020
I'm glad you weren't born

01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:35.540
on this side
of the channel, Thomas,

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:38.380
you'd have been
a thorn in my side too.

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.060
How did you bewitch me
into doing this for you?

01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:43.340
I convinced you that if
the King and I reconciled

01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:45.420
he will be placed
in your debt.

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:47.460
True.

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:50.260
Why does he hate you so?

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:53.260
He's never forgiven me
for preferring God to him.

01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:56.940
Go, Thomas.

01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:08.819
You know, it's
a strange thing

01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.740
but Becket's safety has
become quite dear to me.

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:40.340
You look older, Thomas.

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:43.820
So do you, My Prince.

01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.140
Are you cold?

01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:47.540
I'm frozen stiff,

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:49.580
chilblains are killing me.

01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.700
You love it of course,

01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:51.660
you're in your
element, aren't you,

01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:53.620
just that Monk's habit.

01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:55.740
I always told you
one must fight the cold

01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:57.340
with the cold's weapons.

01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.140
Strip yourself naked
every morning and...

01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:02.140
splash yourself with cold water.

01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:06.420
I used to,

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:09.140
when you were
there to make me.

01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:12.260
I never wash now, I stink.

01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:13.820
How's your son?

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:15.260
he must have come of age.

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:16.260
He's an idiot

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:18.180
and sly like his mother.

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:22.020
Thomas, don't you ever marry.

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:23.420
You took that
matter out of my hands

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:24.620
when you had me ordained.

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.460
If we start on that
we're sure to quarrel.

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:29.220
Talk about something else.

01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:32.300
Very well.

01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:35.260
Has Your Majesty
done much hunting lately?

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:37.620
Yes, every day.

01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:40.300
It doesn't amuse me anymore.

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:42.700
Becket, I'm bored.

01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:44.580
My Prince,

01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.300
I wish I could help you.

01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:48.860
What are you waiting for?

01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:49.980
For the honor of God

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:52.580
and the honor of the
King to become one.

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.020
That may take long.

01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:59.460
Yes, that may take long.

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.780
I'm the King, Thomas,

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:04.060
and so long as
we are on this earth,

01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:06.180
you owe me the first move.

01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.820
I'm prepared to
forget a lot of things

01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:11.780
but not the fact
that I am King.

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:13.140
You yourself taught me that.

01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.220
Never forget it, My Prince,

01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:16.460
you have
a different task to do,

01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:19.140
you have to steer the ship.

01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:21.020
And you, what do
you have to do?

01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.180
To resist you
with all my might

01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:25.060
when you steer
against the Lord God.

01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.740
What do you expect of me then?

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.220
Are you hoping I'll weaken?

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:31.020
No.

01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:33.660
I'm afraid we must only do

01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:38.860
absurdly, what it has
been given to us to do

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:40.780
right to the end.

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.900
Look suppose we
come down to earth

01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:44.260
and use words that make sense

01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.140
to a bore like myself

01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:48.300
otherwise we'll
never get anywhere.

01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:49.940
And there'll be
two frozen statutes

01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:51.660
trying to make their peace

01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:53.500
in a frozen eternity.

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:55.820
My Lord, I was doing my best

01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:57.060
to make you understand.

01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:58.060
I'm an idiot then,

01:56:58.140 --> 01:56:59.780
talk to me like an idiot.

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:01.499
Will you lift
the excommunication

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.020
you pronounced
on Lord Gilbert?

01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.260
No, because it's the
only weapon I have left

01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:07.940
to defend what was
given into my care.

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.340
Will you agree to
the ten proposals

01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:11.340
which the Bishop's
accepted in your absence,

01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:14.020
particularly, to the
surrender of priests

01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.180
who seek the
protection of the church

01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:17.260
to escape
my courts of justice?

01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:18.500
No.

01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.100
My role is to defend my sheep

01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:24.740
and they are my sheep.

01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:26.500
But I shall agree to
the nine other articles

01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:27.620
in the spirit of peace

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:29.020
and because I know
you must remain King

01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.700
in all and of all,

01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.740
save the honor of God.

01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:45.740
All right,

01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:48.340
I will give way
on this one point

01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:51.900
in memory of
our past friendship.

01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:53.900
You may return to England.

01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:55.940
Thank you, My Prince.

01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:57.179
I meant to go back in any case

01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:59.620
and give myself
up to your power.

01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:02.580
For in all things
that concern this earth,

01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:04.620
I owe you obedience.

01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:11.620
We're finished now,

01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:13.580
and I'm cold.

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:19.980
I feel cold too,

01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:22.380
now.

01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:24.780
You never loved
me did you, Thomas?

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:29.380
In so far as
I was capable of love,

01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:31.260
yes, I did.

01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:34.380
Did you start to love God?

01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:35.820
You mule!

01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:37.980
Answer a simple question!

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:42.380
Yes.

01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.180
I started to love

01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:50.180
the honor of God.

01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:52.860
I should never have seen you.

01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:54.299
It hurts too much.

01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:55.220
My Prince.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:57.820
No, no pity,

01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:01.060
it's dirty.

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.860
This is the last time
I shall come begging to you.

01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:06.900
Go back to England.

01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:09.900
Farewell, My Prince.

01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:13.500
I sail tomorrow.

01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:15.260
I know that I shall

01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.460
never see you again.

01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:18.620
How dare you say that to me

01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:19.860
when I've given
you my royal word.

01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:21.420
Do you take me for a traitor?

01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:33.140
Thomas!

02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:18.780
Sit.

02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:21.380
Come here you.

02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:27.340
Sit here.

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.780
You look to me, sir,
not your mother.

02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:33.900
Sit, you witless baboon.

02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:35.500
What is the meaning of this?

02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:36.620
Henry, what are you doing?

02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:38.420
I know very well
what I'm doing madam.

02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:42.020
Out.

02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:43.700
Before you fill your bellies,

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:46.100
we have something to announce.

02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:48.579
Reviving an ancient custom,

02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:50.420
we have decided
to have our successor

02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.540
crowned in our lifetime.

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.100
We do this to
protect the kingdom

02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:57.020
from future
pretenders to the throne.

02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:58.020
Henry, this...

02:00:58.100 --> 02:00:58.940
Shut up.

02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:02.460
Stop dribbling while
I raise you to glory.

02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:04.220
To my successor,

02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:07.300
Henry the III.

02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:11.300
Henry the III.

02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:13.700
When will the
coronation take place?

02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:15.740
As soon as we
arrive in England.

02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.180
Where, may I ask?

02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:19.460
You may well ask.

02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:20.540
At York.

02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:23.260
Not at Canterbury?

02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:25.180
My good mother, gentlemen,

02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:27.900
is hinting with her
customary delicacy

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:31.220
that there is a double
purpose to this mummery.

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:32.940
There is.

02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:34.180
We are going to show

02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:36.020
our freshly
reinstated Archbishop

02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:38.300
that we can still
do without him.

02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:40.660
A coronation of
the English King

02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:42.340
is the most jealously guarded

02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:45.580
privilege of Canterbury.

02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:48.100
I'd give anything
to see Becket's face

02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:50.100
when he learns he's lost it,

02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:52.540
and that York has got it.

02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:57.740
That will fix him.

02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:00.340
Get out of there,
you young cretin,

02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:02.260
you're not crowned yet.

02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:10.820
What a look.

02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.980
Filial devotion

02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:19.700
is a beautiful thing.

02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:21.220
You'd like to
be the real king,

02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:23.300
wouldn't you, you little pig.

02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:25.580
With that number
three after your name

02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:29.180
and papa good and
stiff in his tomb.

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.180
Well, you'll have
to wait a bit.

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.620
Papa is well,

02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:36.740
papa is very well indeed.

02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:39.420
My son, you know
I've always been against

02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.980
any reconciliation
with that wretch Becket.

02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:44.860
You know I understand
your hatred for him,

02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:46.900
but do not let it lead
you into an action,

02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:49.340
which you may
bitterly regret.

02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:51.060
This boy is not clever

02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:52.980
ambitious men will
use him against you

02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:56.380
long before you
cease to reign.

02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:58.780
I'm still very
much alive, madam,

02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.580
and in control.

02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:04.180
Henry, for all our
sakes, think of England

02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:07.660
and not of your disappointed
love for this man.

02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:09.180
Love?

02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:10.780
Love?

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:12.780
A moment ago it was hate.

02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:14.220
And what gives
you the right madam

02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:16.180
to meddle in my
loves and hates?

02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:17.900
You have an
obsession about him,

02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:19.260
which is unhealthy

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:21.300
and unnatural,

02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:23.580
and now that he no
longer gives you comfort...

02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:24.540
Oh, God.

02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:26.300
If Thomas Becket
were a faithless woman,

02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:28.300
you'd behave no differently.

02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:31.740
Sweet Jesus, you tear
him out of your heart.

02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.780
Oh, if I were a man.

02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:38.260
Thank God, madam,
he gave you breasts.

02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:39.860
An asset from which I derived

02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:42.820
not the slightest benefit.

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:45.620
I was let out to be
suckled by a peasant girl.

02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:47.380
That no doubt
is why it is so difficult

02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:50.100
to see the king
beneath your crown.

02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:54.340
So you have something
to add my lady.

02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:56.460
Well go on, add it,

02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:58.540
add it, get it out of you,

02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:01.780
once and for all
in one great whine.

02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:04.780
Let's hear the poison
you've accumulated.

02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:06.780
I pity you.

02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:10.100
I tolerated your
mistresses, sir,

02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:12.540
but do you expect me
to tolerate everything?

02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:13.740
Becket!

02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:15.500
Always Becket!

02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:16.380
I am a woman,

02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:17.620
I am your wife,

02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:18.900
I am a Queen!

02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:20.380
I'll complain to my father!

02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:22.020
I'll complain to
my uncle the Emperor!

02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:23.980
I'll complain to
all the Kings of Europe!

02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:26.100
I'll complain to God!

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.860
If I were you, madam,
I'd start with God!

02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:33.500
Go to your chapel
and see if he's at home!

02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:35.300
Get out the pack of you.

02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:37.780
I wretch with boredom
at the sight of you!

02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:39.060
To the devil,

02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:41.980
with my whole family
if he'll have you!

02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:42.980
And as for you,

02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:44.620
young Henry the III,

02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:46.060
here's my royal foot

02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:48.340
up your royal buttocks!

02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.460
Ah,

02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:06.900
that's better.

02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:10.380
Let us drink, gentlemen.

02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:11.980
Let us drink,

02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:13.620
till we roll under the table

02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:16.020
in vomit and oblivion.

02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.220
My faithful hounds.

02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:25.060
It's warm beside you,

02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:28.260
like beasts in a stable.

02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:31.100
Good sweat.

02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:34.620
Comfortable nothingness.

02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:37.700
Not the least glimmer inside

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:40.180
to spoil the fun.

02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:44.140
And to think before
I met Becket I was like you,

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:46.460
a well oiled machine,

02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.620
for belching,

02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:53.780
whoring and punching heads.

02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:56.540
What did you put
in mine, Thomas,

02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:58.620
That stopped the machine?

02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:04.380
Tell me, do you ever think?

02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:05.740
Never, Sire,

02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:09.819
a gentleman has
better things to do.

02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:11.420
Here, drink up.

02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:16.700
What's the news from England?

02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:19.300
Has Becket landed?

02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:23.500
He has landed, Sire.

02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:27.260
Was no one there
to receive him,

02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:30.660
Lord Gilbert for example?

02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:32.460
Oh, he was there,

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:35.940
damned and
excommunicated as he still is.

02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:37.620
But there were
seven bishops there

02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:40.220
charging his soldiers
not to cause bloodshed

02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:41.980
and give the light
of the safe conduct

02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:43.220
you gave Becket.

02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:45.140
Yes,

02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:47.260
I gave him safe conduct.

02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:50.180
The peasants escorted him

02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:51.780
from village to village.

02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:52.860
They cheered him

02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:54.740
all the way to Canterbury.

02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:56.740
Not a single gentleman,

02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.300
not a single Norman
showed his face.

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:00.540
Only Saxons?

02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:01.620
Yes.

02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:04.140
Swarms of them.

02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:06.060
Becket left
England a fugitive,

02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:07.860
an exile.

02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:09.660
He's returned there
to find an affection

02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:11.619
that people have always saved

02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:13.500
for their king.

02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:19.100
A man who ate my bread.

02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:24.540
A man I raised from nothing.

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.140
A man I loved.

02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.700
Yes,

02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:37.020
I loved him.

02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:39.940
I loved him,

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:44.580
and I still do.

02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:49.020
Enough, oh God, enough.

02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:52.140
Stop.

02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:54.100
Stop.

02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.100
I can do nothing,

02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:07.060
I'm as useless as a woman.

02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:12.100
So long as he's alive,

02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:14.060
I tremble,

02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:17.740
I shake.

02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:21.180
I'm the king,

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.940
and yet I shake.

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.020
Will no one rid me

02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:37.620
of this meddlesome priest?

02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:44.260
A priest who mocks me.

02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:47.139
Are all around me cowards,

02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:49.540
like myself?

02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:53.100
Are there no men
left in England.

02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:00.380
It's my heart.

02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:06.780
It's too fast,

02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:09.660
too fast,

02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:11.740
it's too...

02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:47.860
Thomas.

02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:00.420
Make haste.

02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.580
It's difficult with
all these little laces,

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:04.580
it warrants a woman's hands.

02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.380
A man's hands
are better today.

02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:08.940
What's worth doing,
is worth doing well.

02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:11.220
Yes.

02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:12.220
If it's worth doing,

02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:16.460
it's worth doing well.

02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:19.140
Do up all the laces,
every one of them.

02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:23.580
I must look my best today.

02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:26.460
God will give us time.

02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:28.460
There, that's done.

02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:31.140
But I just as soon had cleaned
out our pigsty at home,

02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:33.420
it's not half
so much hard work.

02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:36.740
Are you fond of your pig?

02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:39.740
Yes, I was.

02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:41.340
At my father's house
we had some pigs too

02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:42.580
when I was a child.

02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:44.300
Did you now?

02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:51.100
Will it...

02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:54.620
be today?

02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:58.500
It's possible, my son.

02:10:58.540 --> 02:10:59.660
Are you afraid?

02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:00.980
Oh, no,

02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:04.740
not if I have time to fight.

02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:06.020
All I want is the chance

02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:08.940
to strike a few blows first,

02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:12.180
so I shan't have done nothing
but receive them all my life.

02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:15.780
If I can kill one
Norman first, just one,

02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:18.540
that'll seem fair
and right enough to me.

02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.100
Are you so set
in killing one?

02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:21.860
Yes, I am.

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:23.020
I don't mind if I am

02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:25.340
just a grain of
sand in a machine

02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:26.500
because I know

02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:29.380
by putting more and more
grains of sand in a machine,

02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:32.420
one day it'll come
grinding to a stop.

02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:34.340
And on that day,

02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:35.460
what then?

02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:37.940
Well, we'll have a fine,
new, well oiled machine

02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:39.900
in place of the old one,

02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:43.340
and this time we'll put
the Normans into it instead.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:50.540
That's what justice
means, doesn't it?

02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:07.420
Now give me my silver cross,

02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:09.380
I must hold it.

02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:16.660
My Lord, it's heavy.

02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:20.460
A good swipe with this
and they'd feel it.

02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:23.260
Lucky little Saxon,

02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:24.620
for you that would
settle all accounts

02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:28.020
in this black worid,
wouldn't it?

02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:41.340
There Lord,

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:45.220
I am ready,

02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:47.940
adorned for your festivities.

02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:53.740
Come,

02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.420
let us go to the altar.

02:13:20.580 --> 02:13:22.020
Your Grace.

02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:25.300
Your Grace.

02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:27.460
There are armed
men at the doors.

02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:28.860
I bolted the doors but...

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.980
It's time for vespers.

02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:32.900
Does one bolt the
doors during vespers,

02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:34.420
I've never heard of it?

02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:35.740
But Your Grace?

02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:37.860
Open them.

02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:39.260
Everything must
be as it should be

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:41.140
for divine service.

02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:19.740
It is here now,

02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:22.540
the supreme folly,

02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:24.940
this is its hour.

02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:07.980
One does not carry
arms into God's house.

02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:11.140
What do you want?

02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:13.180
Your death.

02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:25.380
We will continue
with the service.

02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:34.100
Saxon!

02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:37.380
Dog!

02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:39.060
Traitor!

02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:09.580
Oh Lord,

02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:12.260
how heavy thy
honor is to bear.

02:17:06.299 --> 02:17:08.660
Poor, Henry.

02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:48.139
Thank you.

02:17:49.379 --> 02:17:51.340
Thank you.

02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:53.340
Yes, yes, it was all agreed.

02:17:53.379 --> 02:17:57.860
I forgive you, pigs.

02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:01.580
Saxon pigs.

02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:06.299
They certainly wanted
their money's worth.

02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:10.020
Is there a
large crowd outside?

02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:12.260
Yes, Sire.

02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:15.139
There's nothing more
certain to win them over

02:18:15.219 --> 02:18:17.499
than the sight of
a king doing penance

02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:19.740
and humbling himself
under the lash.

02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:26.340
The honor of God, gentlemen,

02:18:26.379 --> 02:18:28.900
is a very good thing

02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.180
and all things considered

02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:35.620
one gains by having
it on one's side.

02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:38.459
Thomas Becket our friend,

02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:40.540
always used to say so.

02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:45.100
Tonight in council,

02:18:45.139 --> 02:18:46.940
we will determine
what punishment

02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:50.260
his murderers should receive.

02:18:50.299 --> 02:18:52.420
Sire, they are unknown.

02:18:55.059 --> 02:18:56.780
Our justice will
seek them out,

02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:58.820
you may be sure.

02:19:05.299 --> 02:19:08.139
It is a time my dear Barons,

02:19:08.219 --> 02:19:10.860
for all of us to do penance.

02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:39.180
Hear me!

02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:41.260
People of Canterbury

02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:45.540
and citizens of England.

02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:48.980
As I have submitted
myself to the lash,

02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:52.700
so have I petitioned the Pope.

02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:54.380
And this day,

02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:56.860
I have received his answer.

02:19:56.940 --> 02:19:58.820
Thomas Becket,

02:19:58.900 --> 02:20:01.780
former Archbishop
of Canterbury

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.700
and martyr to the cause

02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:06.500
of God and his church

02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:09.620
shall henceforth be honored

02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:12.780
and prayed to in this kingdom

02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:14.860
as a saint.

02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:48.180
Is the honor of God

02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:51.260
washed clean enough?

02:20:51.300 --> 02:20:54.220
Are you satisfied now, Thomas?
