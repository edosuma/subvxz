WEBVTT

00:00.951 --> 00:02.251
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:03.161 --> 00:04.527
- So you didn't D.T.R.?
- We're seniors.

00:04.529 --> 00:06.228
We don't need
to D.T. Anything.

00:06.230 --> 00:07.863
We had fun,
and I'm not gonna overthink it.

00:07.865 --> 00:08.597
- I want to break up.

00:08.599 --> 00:11.000
- Do you really want to be
single in senior year?

00:11.002 --> 00:12.101
- I'm sorry to bother you,

00:12.103 --> 00:13.135
but I know
you've been avoiding me,

00:13.137 --> 00:16.639
and I'm just wondering why.
- I'm adopted.

00:18.475 --> 00:20.876
- After Matty dropped the bomb
that his family wasn't nuclear,

00:20.878 --> 00:21.978
I knew it was time to adopt

00:21.980 --> 00:24.347
a new attitude
towards our relationship.

00:24.349 --> 00:25.514
I had spent all that time

00:25.516 --> 00:27.016
worrying Matty
was shutting me out.

00:27.018 --> 00:28.884
But he actually ended up
letting me in...

00:28.886 --> 00:30.519
On the fact
that he was adopted,

00:30.521 --> 00:33.122
and his parents
had never bothered to tell him.

00:33.124 --> 00:34.390
Reality check for Jenna--

00:34.392 --> 00:38.461
time to stop making
everything about me.

00:38.463 --> 00:39.228
Val!

00:39.230 --> 00:42.131
I'm really excited
for the peer-mentoring program.

00:42.133 --> 00:42.965
- Me too.

00:42.967 --> 00:44.934
With you girls shouldering
some of my counseling burden,

00:44.936 --> 00:47.003
I'll have
two afternoons a week free

00:47.005 --> 00:48.971
for some much-needed
alone time.

00:48.973 --> 00:52.241
Oh, look, there's
your mentee now--Prudence.

00:52.243 --> 00:53.809
- She reminded me of me--

00:53.811 --> 00:57.480
a lost lamb headed for the
slaughter that is high school.

00:57.482 --> 00:59.315
I decided
I would be there for her,

00:59.317 --> 01:02.385
the way I wished
someone had been there for me--

01:02.387 --> 01:03.986
well, someone sane.

01:03.988 --> 01:06.389
I would listen to her.
I would support her.

01:06.391 --> 01:10.026
And I would keep her
out of harm's way.

01:10.794 --> 01:12.928
Oh, my God.
I'm Jenna.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.630
Are you okay, Prudence?

01:14.632 --> 01:18.534
The last person that called me
that got throat-punched.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.203
[Hard rock music]

01:21.205 --> 01:24.040
- Oh, are you--
- call me Angel.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.941
- [Clears throat]

01:28.745 --> 01:31.447
- Have you heard anything
going around

01:31.449 --> 01:32.515
about Jake dumping me?

01:32.517 --> 01:34.116
It is all about
who controls the story.

01:34.118 --> 01:35.418
Jake better not
make up anything

01:35.420 --> 01:36.952
about our breakup
that isn't true.

01:36.954 --> 01:39.188
I did not get dumped.
I knew the ending was pending.

01:39.190 --> 01:41.424
- Do you ever think that maybe
we spend a little too much time

01:41.426 --> 01:43.726
wondering about what Jake
and Matty are thinking?

01:43.728 --> 01:44.760
- Uh, no.
- Okay.

01:44.762 --> 01:47.663
99% of the time it's probably
not about us at all.

01:47.665 --> 01:48.264
- Who are you,

01:48.266 --> 01:51.367
and what have you done
with "I am Jenna Hamilton"?

01:51.369 --> 01:52.968
Hello, Jacob.

01:52.970 --> 01:56.806
- Hello, ladies.
Take it easy.

01:56.808 --> 01:57.773
- "Take it easy"?

01:57.775 --> 01:59.508
What is the subtext
in that context--

01:59.510 --> 02:00.643
that I'm taking it hard?

02:00.645 --> 02:01.911
- Maybe he meant
take it easy.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.046
He wants to be your friend.
- We just broke up, Jenna.

02:04.048 --> 02:06.582
You can't just transition
from B.F. To B.F.F.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.217
Without some "D"
in between.

02:08.219 --> 02:09.185
- "D"?
- Drama.

02:09.187 --> 02:10.786
- Okay.
Maybe you can.

02:10.788 --> 02:12.855
We're seniors.
We're adults now.

02:12.857 --> 02:13.956
Ending the relationship

02:13.958 --> 02:15.958
doesn't have to mean
ending the friendship.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.059
I mean,
look at Matty and I.

02:17.061 --> 02:18.227
In a lot of ways,
we're closer than ever.

02:18.229 --> 02:20.629
- Because you had ex sex?
That doesn't mean you're close.

02:20.631 --> 02:21.964
That just means
your naughties are.

02:21.966 --> 02:23.499
- No, because we share things
with each other

02:23.501 --> 02:25.167
that we wouldn't share
with just anyone,

02:25.169 --> 02:27.269
sort of like
emotional intimacy.

02:27.271 --> 02:29.038
- Okay,
what does that even mean?

02:29.040 --> 02:31.440
Are you guys dating
or merely mating?

02:31.442 --> 02:33.109
- I don't know.
- [Sighs]

02:33.111 --> 02:34.477
Well, you better
figure it out now,

02:34.479 --> 02:36.912
because I am officially
not spending my senior year

02:36.914 --> 02:40.483
staring at
your "am I in or am I out" pout.

02:40.485 --> 02:41.450
- She had a point.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.953
In the past, Matty had been
a giant, flaky slice

02:43.955 --> 02:45.921
in my pie chart
of preoccupations.

02:45.923 --> 02:47.823
But things
were different now.

02:47.825 --> 02:49.792
Hey.
How are you?

02:49.794 --> 02:50.759
- I'm fine.

02:50.761 --> 02:52.228
- Have you spoken
to your parents yet?

02:52.230 --> 02:55.030
- No, and I don't really want
to talk about that at school,

02:55.032 --> 02:57.066
or at all, really.
- I get it.

02:57.068 --> 02:59.201
Listen,
I know this sounds stupid,

02:59.203 --> 03:00.836
but I was worrying
for, like, a whole day

03:00.838 --> 03:03.139
that you regretted
hooking up with me.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.407
- Jenna, I need to be able
to not talk to you for one day

03:05.409 --> 03:07.910
and not have you assume
I'm not into you.

03:07.912 --> 03:10.546
- I-I know.
I said it was stupid.

03:10.548 --> 03:12.848
- I'm into you.

03:12.850 --> 03:14.550
- I'm into you too.

03:14.552 --> 03:16.118
And I just thought
that if we'd said it

03:16.120 --> 03:19.955
that neither one of us would
have to worry about what we are.

03:19.957 --> 03:22.057
- Okay.

03:22.059 --> 03:23.192
What are we?

03:23.194 --> 03:26.529
- We are two consenting adults

03:26.531 --> 03:28.931
who care
about each other deeply

03:28.933 --> 03:34.770
and enjoy expressing
that care physically...

03:34.772 --> 03:36.739
From time to time.

03:36.741 --> 03:38.307
Friends...

03:38.309 --> 03:39.175
- With benefits.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.178
- I wasn't aware
that was what I was proposing.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.779
But if that's what it meant
to be close,

03:43.781 --> 03:46.415
but to not have to examine
what it meant all the time,

03:46.417 --> 03:48.284
then, hey, I was in.

03:48.286 --> 03:49.985
Yeah.
I guess we are.

03:49.987 --> 03:51.253
- I'm down.

03:51.255 --> 03:54.924
I'll see you later...
Friend.

03:54.926 --> 03:55.991
[Chuckles]
- Oh.

03:55.993 --> 03:58.227
Hey, I'm around to talk later
after school.

03:58.229 --> 04:01.630
- Yeah, maybe I'll, uh,
hit you up later.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.432
But it won't be to talk.

04:03.434 --> 04:05.000
- Okay, so maybe
emotional intimacy

04:05.002 --> 04:08.270
wasn't something you could
achieve between bio and gym,

04:08.272 --> 04:09.838
but at least he knew
I was there for him.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.843
- Welcome to the first meeting
of we're here, we're peers.

04:14.845 --> 04:16.145
Now let's get mentoring.

04:16.147 --> 04:19.715
Being the chicken soup
for someone else's soul

04:19.717 --> 04:20.749
is a delicate brew,

04:20.751 --> 04:23.819
but you're about to learn
from the master chef.

04:23.821 --> 04:25.888
I've matched up
each senior girl

04:25.890 --> 04:28.157
with a freshman
in need of guidance.

04:28.159 --> 04:31.327
There will be a progress review
at the end of the week,

04:31.329 --> 04:33.128
where each freshman
will share what she learned,

04:33.130 --> 04:37.299
and each senior will get
a community-service credit.

04:37.301 --> 04:38.567
- I love your maxi dress!

04:38.569 --> 04:42.171
- It's called Hijab.
We wear it for modesty.

04:42.173 --> 04:43.939
- Aw.
Well, you seem nice.

04:43.941 --> 04:45.608
It's too bad
you won't get into heaven.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.843
- It's too bad you won't get
into Jannah dressed like that.

04:47.845 --> 04:50.246
- Is that the new three-level,
over-18 club in Westwood?

04:50.248 --> 04:54.183
- It's Muslim heaven.
It has seven levels.

04:54.185 --> 04:55.985
- I don't know why
you need counseling, Caitlin.

04:55.987 --> 04:57.453
You seem supes together.

04:57.455 --> 04:59.321
- Thanks.
I'm grateful, not hateful.

04:59.323 --> 05:01.290
Being a joiner
is just in my DNA.

05:01.292 --> 05:02.725
- Same.
Don't hate...

05:02.727 --> 05:04.660
Both:
Participate.

05:04.662 --> 05:06.962
- Trippy.

05:06.964 --> 05:09.431
- I need less virgin
at the bus stop

05:09.433 --> 05:11.000
and more whore on the floor.

05:11.002 --> 05:12.201
- But I've never had sex.

05:12.203 --> 05:13.969
- And I've never bitch-slapped
an Olsen twin,

05:13.971 --> 05:18.073
but that does not stop me
from dressing like I have.

05:18.075 --> 05:19.842
Wear it till you tear it.

05:19.844 --> 05:21.043
- Sadie.

05:21.045 --> 05:23.379
S-a-d...

05:23.381 --> 05:25.381
i-e.

05:25.383 --> 05:28.017
Do you not speak English?
Mine's broken!

05:28.019 --> 05:29.084
I got a broken one.

05:29.086 --> 05:31.720
- She's an exchange student
from <i>España.</i>

05:31.722 --> 05:33.656
Sorry, that's what was left.

05:33.658 --> 05:38.694
Earlier, Shiri and Angel had
an altercation in the hallway.

05:38.696 --> 05:40.929
This is what I call
a teachable moment.

05:40.931 --> 05:47.036
- "It makes me feel angry when
I don't feel I am being heard."

05:47.038 --> 05:49.271
- [Spanish accent]
"It make me a-feel..."

05:49.273 --> 05:51.507
- [Whispering] Faster.
- <i>Qué es</i> "angry"?

05:51.509 --> 05:52.775
- Okay, I...
- <i>Enojado?</i>

05:52.777 --> 05:54.576
- I got a parent-teacher meeting
off campus in about an hour.

05:54.578 --> 05:56.312
So why don't we have
your mentors

05:56.314 --> 05:59.882
show you how it's done, huh?

06:01.017 --> 06:03.986
- "It makes me feel angry"...

06:03.988 --> 06:05.921
When manic pixie dream girls,

06:05.923 --> 06:07.690
who have spent
the last three years

06:07.692 --> 06:09.525
giving handies
in the sanctuary,

06:09.527 --> 06:12.094
all of a sudden find ambition
in time for college apps

06:12.096 --> 06:17.766
and monopolize my free period
with touchy-feely bull <i>caca.</i>

06:17.768 --> 06:21.637
- I wanted to respond in kind
to Sadie's unkind rant,

06:21.639 --> 06:24.306
but I wanted to succeed
as a mentor even more,

06:24.308 --> 06:27.142
and that meant embracing
the exercise...

06:27.144 --> 06:27.710
And the enemy.

06:27.712 --> 06:31.647
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

06:31.649 --> 06:33.315
- Ew!
Bad touch!

06:33.317 --> 06:34.149
Bad touch!

06:34.151 --> 06:36.685
Seriously, I am going to puke.

06:38.521 --> 06:40.222
- Oh, hey,
you can have the table.

06:40.224 --> 06:42.725
I got a working lunch--
working on my music.

06:42.727 --> 06:45.327
- Okay, flag on the player--

06:45.329 --> 06:46.795
he's trying to spin this.

06:46.797 --> 06:47.830
Giving me the lunch table,

06:47.832 --> 06:49.398
he is trying to look
like the good guy.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.034
- Can't you just accept
that maybe he is the good guy?

06:52.036 --> 06:54.169
I'm telling you,
this is how mature breakups go.

06:54.171 --> 06:56.705
- Well, if he's expecting
ex sex from me,

06:56.707 --> 06:58.374
we are not there...

06:58.376 --> 06:59.041
Yet.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.844
- Can I crash
with you bitches?

07:01.846 --> 07:04.546
- Hey, Matty,
are you not eating?

07:04.548 --> 07:06.248
- Nope, not hungry.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.683
- Oh, well,
if you get hungry later,

07:07.685 --> 07:08.984
I'll never finish this uni.

07:08.986 --> 07:12.020
- Jake won't mind if you spend
some Q.T. With some cuties.

07:12.022 --> 07:14.656
This lunch table
is neutral ground. Sit.

07:14.658 --> 07:15.824
- Yeah, I don't want to sit,

07:15.826 --> 07:17.426
and I don't want uni,
whatever that is.

07:17.428 --> 07:19.128
What I want to do is go
to the gym and lift weights,

07:19.130 --> 07:23.332
which is where I was headed
before you guys stopped me.

07:23.334 --> 07:25.134
- Jesus,
someone's on the roid rag.

07:25.136 --> 07:28.337
- Cut him some slack.
He's going through a rough time.

07:28.339 --> 07:29.471
- You just had sex with him.

07:29.473 --> 07:30.939
Would it kill him to hang
for one panini?

07:30.941 --> 07:32.641
- He doesn't have to treat me
like a girlfriend.

07:32.643 --> 07:35.944
We have an understanding.
We're friends, not a couple.

07:35.946 --> 07:38.947
- ♪ I guess I'm out of luck

You're pulling
a Timberlake post Britney,

08:06.177 --> 08:07.910
a Taylor Swift post, like,
everybody.

08:07.912 --> 08:11.780
This wannabe remix to Jakara
is totally misleading!

08:11.782 --> 08:16.318
Tomorrow does come when tomorrow
is properly stimulated.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.486
- This song's not about you.

08:17.488 --> 08:20.322
It's "tomorrow."
"Tomorrow never comes."

08:20.324 --> 08:22.524
It's about the hopelessness
of love.

08:22.526 --> 08:24.359
You did break my heart.

08:24.361 --> 08:25.928
All: Aw.
- Oh. [Scoffs]

08:25.930 --> 08:27.463
- But the song's
still not about you.

08:27.465 --> 08:31.266
