WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.160
I understand now that my attempt to
circumnavigate the world in 80 days

00:05.160 --> 00:08.160
is not going to be without some
extremely serious obstacles.

00:08.160 --> 00:12.040
I had a friend who always said
any one of us can achieve anything.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.360
What was his name?

00:13.360 --> 00:15.680
Hers, actually.
A mysterious woman?

00:15.680 --> 00:17.680
She has a travelling companion,
Jane Digby.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.160
The Bedouin bed-hopper.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.760
His job was to write the truth.
My father chose to write lies.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.520
My oldest and dearest friend
may not be a hero after all.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.160
There can be no forgiveness.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.280
Passepartout!

00:29.280 --> 00:31.640
I killed a man, monsieur.
I know you did.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.480
I made a wager. A bet - that is
still all you care about?

00:34.480 --> 00:36.920
Â£10,000.
20,000.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.320
I'm coming into money,

00:39.320 --> 00:42.800
more than enough to make this
unpleasantness go away.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.440
I have a friend who is very keen

00:44.440 --> 00:47.840
that our Mr Fogg doesn't make it
back to London on Christmas Eve.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.800
What do I have to do?

00:54.840 --> 00:57.160
BELL CLANGS, FLY BUZZES

01:04.400 --> 01:06.800
FLIES BUZZ

01:09.800 --> 01:13.080
It's preposterous. I've half a mind
to blame you, Miss Fix.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.040
It was there in black
and white in the Telegraph -

01:15.040 --> 01:17.240
the rail line had been completed
across India.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.680
It was your article, Miss Fix.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.720
I didn't actually build
the railway myself,

01:20.720 --> 01:22.560
I merely reported its existence.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.040
But it does not exist.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.200
You are the most infuriatingly
glass-half-empty person.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.720
She's right, you've been like
a bear with a sore head

01:30.720 --> 01:32.000
ever since Yemen.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.160
Where is this village?

01:36.160 --> 01:38.760
Another thing that does not exist.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.880
FOGG CALLS OUT

01:42.280 --> 01:45.160
It's in my eye! It's in my
eye! There's a fly in my actual eye!

01:45.160 --> 01:47.160
An actual fly in my eye!

01:47.160 --> 01:50.480
Monsieur, if we get back on
the train it will return us

01:50.480 --> 01:52.320
to that lovely hotel in Bombay where

01:52.320 --> 01:54.400
the chilled beer glasses
are always full.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.040
You mean give up?

01:56.040 --> 01:57.680
We are NOT giving up.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.800
We just need something
to hold on to.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.360
Some sort of sign.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.720
Oh!

02:08.720 --> 02:10.160
Hello!

02:10.160 --> 02:13.240
We're looking for
the village of Narupani.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.440
Wait!

02:18.720 --> 02:20.360
Narupani?

02:20.360 --> 02:22.160
Ah! Narupani!

02:32.080 --> 02:33.200
Thank you.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.760
Hello.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.200
Hello.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.880
Hello, hello. Hello.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.600
Nice to meet you all.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.040
Thank you. Pleasure.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.640
Oh, look at that. Oh, that's lovely.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.960
What a wonderful place.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.920
Hello.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.320
Welcome.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.200
Thank you. Hello.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.600
We are preparing the village for
a wedding.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.920
Oh, how splendid.

03:16.920 --> 03:20.000
In that case you'll be relieved to
know we won't be imposing on you.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.040
This is the bride.
My daughter, Samanaz.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.840
Warmest congratulations on your
impending nuptials, young lady.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.520
Now, we need to get ourselves rather
urgently to Allahabad.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.440
The groom, Arjan.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.240
Phileas Fogg, pleased to meet you.
My travelling companion,

03:32.240 --> 03:34.080
Miss Fix. My valet, Passepartout.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.560
You will be our very special guests.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.120
Oh, no time for that, I'm afraid.
Time is of the essence.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.600
We are attempting to travel
around the world in 80 days.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.560
Why?

03:47.040 --> 03:48.200
Why? Because...

03:48.200 --> 03:49.760
That's not important.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.400
We need a guide to take us
over the hills to Allahabad

03:52.400 --> 03:54.520
so we can catch another train
to Calcutta.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.160
In the morning I will give you
our guide.Not in the morning,

03:57.160 --> 03:59.400
I'm afraid, now.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.760
Manners, Mr Fogg.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.160
I'm so sorry, madame,
I forget myself.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.560
We can pay our way, of course.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.240
Everyone in the village
is going to the wedding.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.160
There can be no exceptions.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.040
This is where you
will spend the night.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.080
This is very generous of you, but...

05:08.080 --> 05:09.640
I absolutely insist.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.320
You will take my room.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.600
Oh, no, no, no, we can't
take your own rooms.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.200
You are our guest.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.280
Well, it's absolutely wonderful.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.560
There's even a couch for
you, Passepartout.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.960
I will let you wash
after your journey.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.480
We will leave in the morning, yes?

05:35.880 --> 05:37.680
This way.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.720
You are travelling unmarried?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.920
Yes, I am. For 80 days.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.200
Or 80 years, if I'm lucky.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.640
This is beautiful.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.280
Thank you.
And you are a journalist?

05:51.280 --> 05:53.520
Shocking, isn't it?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.440
You can do your writing
over there if you like.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.840
Right.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.080
I guess I'd better get started.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.520
I don't betray my friends.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.920
Friends? Is that really
what they are?

06:25.920 --> 06:28.880
If we leave at dawn
and this guide is any good at all,

06:28.880 --> 06:31.160
there's still a chance we'll
make it to Allahabad.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.000
Maybe we should rest up here
for a few days,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.160
refresh ourselves, then make
up time in some other way.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.840
Out of the question!
We're not on a jaunt,

06:39.840 --> 06:41.280
we're on a mission.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.600
I like that,
I could give it to Miss Fix.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.000
The Miss Fix who hasn't written

06:47.000 --> 06:49.680
a word since she found out her
father's legs were made of clay?

06:49.680 --> 06:52.400
Is that tea ready?
I'm absolutely parched.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.000
Put this in his drink.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.720
He'll sleep for a week,
he'll lose a stupid wager

07:00.720 --> 07:02.480
and all will be well with the world.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.600
GUNSHOTS

07:18.680 --> 07:20.360
Ah!

07:20.360 --> 07:22.680
For God's sake, Passepartout.
Be more careful.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.080
Don't start babbling in French,

07:39.080 --> 07:41.280
just clear it up
and make me a cup of tea.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.880
I'm hardly being unreasonable,
it's your job.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.120
Now listen here, Passepartout...

08:16.920 --> 08:18.800
I miss you, Grayson.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.840
What are you writing?

08:39.840 --> 08:41.040
Nothing.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.160
Every word I used to write
I'd imagine my father reading.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.360
I lived to impress him,
I see that now.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.960
No longer?

08:51.960 --> 08:53.520
No longer.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.480
Take your clothes off.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.560
I beg your pardon!

09:00.560 --> 09:03.720
I can't dress you
wearing that... What is this?

09:03.720 --> 09:05.320
A corset.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.840
It looks very uncomfortable.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.400
Take it off.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.640
Hm? Does this bit
not get covered up?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.360
Of course not.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.960
I wasn't looking.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.360
FESTIVE LOCAL MUSIC PLAYS

09:57.040 --> 09:59.000
How long do these ceremonies
normally take?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.600
Oh, I don't know.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.160
You know, I never thought that
could happen to such as me.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.560
I know I'm not a catch.
I'm poor, I've got no work.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.600
But Samanaz says I'm genuine
in my heart.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.080
Well, she seems like a fine woman

10:11.080 --> 10:12.960
and I'm sure she will make you
a fine wife.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.600
Because you have such knowledge
of women and love.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.000
Are you married, Mr Fogg?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.600
Oh!

10:18.600 --> 10:21.040
PASSEPARTOUT LAUGHS

10:27.760 --> 10:31.000
This lady has made her favourite
dish for you. Khatte Chole.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.960
How splendid. Thank you.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.440
Thank you.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.520
Um... A utensil or...?

10:39.520 --> 10:40.960
Oh, we use our fingers, Mr Fogg.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.360
Of course we do.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.840
Hot enough, Monsieur?

10:57.600 --> 10:59.240
Some more, Monsieur?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.960
Good?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.080
Mm.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.720
Gentlemen. The ladies are here.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.160
Miss Fix.
Passepartout.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.000
Beautiful. Both of them.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.280
He seems a fine fellow.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.760
He is.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.680
Why exactly are you attempting

12:08.680 --> 12:10.960
to travel around
the world in 80 days?

12:10.960 --> 12:13.440
To see if it's possible, I suppose.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.440
And if it is, what will you learn?

12:15.440 --> 12:18.080
That you can go on a great journey

12:18.080 --> 12:21.040
and arrive back in exactly
the same place that you began?

12:21.040 --> 12:23.200
But in 80 days.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.840
But what is the point?

12:26.960 --> 12:28.800
Ah.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.360
You've undertaken this great journey
and you don't even know why.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.320
Find him.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.440
Search the whole village.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.000
We British have a long tradition
of exploring new frontiers.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.480
Yes. You are always looking

12:50.480 --> 12:53.560
for new places to grow your tea,
that is true.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.240
I think Britain has more than
repaid India for the tea.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.400
SHOUTING

13:01.840 --> 13:03.200
Let's get this done, mate.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.240
With what?

13:06.240 --> 13:09.640
Universities.
Which we have had for 2,000 years.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.680
Really?
Mm.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.960
Really? Um... Well, then...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.760
SCREAMING

13:16.920 --> 13:18.160
..railways.

13:18.160 --> 13:22.560
Which are so good you are here in my
village asking to borrow my guide.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.920
We've checked every house, sir.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.280
They're here.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.240
To bless you on your journey.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.400
This is the tripundra.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.720
I am so sorry.
If you would prefer me not to...

14:08.720 --> 14:10.320
No, no. Go on.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.720
The three lines represent will,
knowledge and action.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.160
Sepoy Arjan Anand.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.920
What on earth are you people
doing here?

14:25.920 --> 14:28.400
Behaving rather better than you
by the looks of it.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.920
Is there some sort of problem?

14:31.480 --> 14:34.880
Sepoy Arjan Anand, show yourself.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.680
There is no-one here by that name.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.640
Where is he?

15:01.440 --> 15:03.920
I will ask you one more time.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.480
Where is he?

15:07.760 --> 15:09.120
Samanaz...

15:11.400 --> 15:13.880
SHOUTING

15:13.880 --> 15:15.960
Silence!

15:15.960 --> 15:17.120
Arjan.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.640
Sepoy Anand,

15:20.640 --> 15:23.760
you are under arrest
for desertion of the Indian Army.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.600
Don't point that at her.
Please, Jim.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.520
Bleedin' hell, Arjan,
what have you done?

15:27.520 --> 15:30.080
Arjan had permission to leave
from his Commanding Officer.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.480
I am his Commanding Officer

15:31.480 --> 15:34.840
and I gave no such permission.
Sepoy, ten-shun.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.560
No! Please.
We're getting married tomorrow.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.480
Not to this deserter, you're not.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.680
Lieutenant, my name is Phileas Fogg.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.160
There must be some sort
of mistake here.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.920
He is a deserter, sir. No mistake.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.720
He'll be court-martialled tomorrow.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.520
No! What will happen to him?

15:55.520 --> 15:59.080
If he's found guilty, he'll be
transported overseas to Malacca.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.000
No, no, no...

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
Back to camp!

16:02.400 --> 16:04.520
No. Arjan, no!

16:04.520 --> 16:06.120
Arjan, no!

16:06.120 --> 16:08.000
No! Arjan!

16:18.480 --> 16:19.600
Arjan...

16:21.440 --> 16:24.640
Monsieur?There you are.
Pack everything up, we're leaving.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.400
We just got here.The wedding is
off, they can release the guide,

16:27.400 --> 16:29.440
we can still make the 7am
from Allahabad.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.120
Did you see what just happened?

16:31.120 --> 16:33.080
The bride and groom were pulled
apart on

16:33.080 --> 16:34.800
the day before their wedding.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.400
Don't be so soppy and French.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.800
No wonder you chaps
don't have an empire.

16:38.800 --> 16:42.200
This really is just about a bet
to you, isn't it?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.880
Yes.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.240
Yes! Stop looking
for ulterior motives.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.880
A friend bet me
I couldn't do this thing,

16:47.880 --> 16:50.640
I'm going to prove that I can.
No matter what it costs?

16:50.640 --> 16:52.560
The boy lied to her
and broke her heart.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.840
If we catch the train or miss
the train, her heart remains broken.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.440
It is going to be a long night,
Monsieur. Some tea before we go?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.440
Finally, a good idea.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.520
You told my guide to get ready
to take you to Allahabad?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.040
Yes.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.440
A little forward of you.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.040
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.640
Um... We are in a hurry,
I meant no disrespect.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.240
I will, of course, expect payment.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.600
Oh. Yes, of course.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.720
I do not want your money.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.920
I want you to talk to the
Lieutenant and persuade him

17:27.920 --> 17:30.440
to release Arjan.
That will be my payment.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.840
I can't do that.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.920
He will listen to you.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.200
He's an officer in the army,

17:35.200 --> 17:37.480
he will not and should not
listen to me.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.000
One of his soldiers deserted,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.080
he will be court-martialled
and punished.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.960
Get him to release Arjan,
or no guide.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.000
No guide, no 80 days.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.200
You can fall out of love
with a country. Thank you.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.480
I suppose I'll have to talk to
the wretched man.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.720
I say "man", he looked about 12.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.040
Forgive me if I seem
a little callous, Passepartout,

18:03.040 --> 18:06.000
this is not our business,
we must not get embroiled in this.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.720
Give the Lieutenant my card,
ask him to join me for supper.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.480
I'll speak up for the lad
and we'll be on our way.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.720
That hit the spot.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.800
SAMANAZ: How could he
have done this to me?

18:26.840 --> 18:29.760
He told me he had permission
from his Commanding Officer.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.600
Maybe he was refused permission

18:33.600 --> 18:36.320
but just wanted to be with you.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.840
To marry you.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.280
I need to see him.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.800
Now? He'll be under armed guard.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.920
I don't care,
I need to speak to Arjan.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.600
This is the army, Samanaz,
they won't let you see him.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.080
ARMY OFFICER SHOUTS

19:04.280 --> 19:07.160
The boys wanted you to have this.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.200
Thank you.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.800
If it turns out bad, Arjan,

19:13.800 --> 19:15.520
I'll keep an eye on her for you.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.760
Try and get some sleep.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.080
Patum Peperium.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.640
The Gentleman's Relish.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.720
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.240
Thank you, sir.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.960
How long have you been
out here in India?

19:50.960 --> 19:52.440
Six months.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.600
And in the army?

19:54.600 --> 19:55.720
Six months.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.800
Have you ever been in
love, Lieutenant?

20:04.560 --> 20:07.480
That's a bit of a
personal question, Mr Fogg.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.440
I could ask you the same question.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.480
Well, I asked it first, so...

20:13.960 --> 20:17.480
Actually,
I have a fiancee back in England.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.920
Would you care to see
a photograph of her?

20:19.920 --> 20:21.800
Oh, very much, yes.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.880
Her name is Penelope.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.320
Hm.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.080
You find my fiancee's face amusing?

20:39.080 --> 20:41.480
Oh, no, of course not.
She is extremely beautiful.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.760
Listen, Bathurst...

20:49.760 --> 20:51.520
Mm... Bathurst.

20:51.520 --> 20:55.040
I want to talk to you
about Sepoy Arjan.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.200
FOGG CLEARS THROAT

20:58.200 --> 21:01.080
He's a young man,
and he's made a mistake.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.960
Could you see to it...

21:05.360 --> 21:06.840
..to drop the charges...

21:08.680 --> 21:10.560
..just this once?

21:13.040 --> 21:16.840
You are asking a British officer
in the Indian Army

21:16.840 --> 21:18.840
to look the other way?

21:18.840 --> 21:20.480
Yes, I am.

21:23.720 --> 21:24.960
No.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.680
FOGG LAUGHS

21:28.560 --> 21:31.280
You look tired, Monsieur.
It's been a long day.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.080
Actually, Passepartout,
I feel absolutely tiptop.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.400
WHISPERS: Careful.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.960
QUIETLY: Arjan?

22:04.280 --> 22:05.680
Samanaz?

23:39.880 --> 23:41.960
Is it me or is it getting
awfully hot?

23:43.200 --> 23:45.400
Perhaps it is time to go to sleep.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.640
Stop telling me to go to sleep.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.160
I should retire myself,
a busy day tomorrow.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.920
And it starts with...

23:54.840 --> 23:58.360
..the court martial of young Arjan.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.640
Yes.
Yes.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.800
How many courts martial...

24:05.000 --> 24:06.920
..martial courts have you...

24:08.520 --> 24:09.960
..overseen?

24:11.760 --> 24:13.280
None!

24:13.280 --> 24:14.800
That is completely...

24:16.640 --> 24:19.880
That is completely immaterial.
The man will get a fair hearing.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.800
If your mother was here now,

24:23.800 --> 24:26.280
how would she want you to behave?

24:26.280 --> 24:27.720
Hm? With...

24:27.720 --> 24:29.520
With kindness

24:29.520 --> 24:31.360
and empathy,

24:31.360 --> 24:33.600
or with by-the-book rigidity?!

24:33.600 --> 24:35.400
My mother is dead, sir.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.800
She died when I was five years old.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.600
Right.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.720
Lieutenant, please forgive me.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.520
You are a disgrace!

24:43.520 --> 24:46.040
Oh, please, Lieutenant, forgive me.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.560
Why did I laugh, Passepartout?

24:51.560 --> 24:54.080
Because you are tired
and you need to sleep...

24:54.080 --> 24:56.760
PASSEPARTOUT CRIES OUT

24:54.080 --> 24:56.760
Hoo-hoo!

24:56.760 --> 24:58.360
Monsieur!

25:00.920 --> 25:02.320
Where are you, Miss Fix?

25:21.680 --> 25:24.040
Would you like me to get you
a cab, Mr Fortescue?

25:26.120 --> 25:28.680
No, Roberts, I would not like that.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.160
Do you have children, Roberts?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.520
No, sir.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.960
To be loved by your own child...

25:46.240 --> 25:47.720
..is a fine thing.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.640
Perhaps the very finest thing
that can ever happen to a man.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.080
I had a daughter once.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.680
You still do, sir.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.160
She won't want a father like me,
will she?

26:07.080 --> 26:08.800
A liar.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.240
A fraud.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.920
Are you sure I can't get
you that cab, sir?

26:14.920 --> 26:16.880
I said no, and I mean no!

26:24.920 --> 26:27.000
I was loved by a child once.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.080
A remarkable child.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.720
To be honest, I never
really got on with Wagner.

26:39.720 --> 26:42.200
All a bit heavy-going.
My friend Fortescue,

26:42.200 --> 26:45.040
on the other hand,
laps it up. Says it's profound.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.720
Do you know Fortescue?

26:46.720 --> 26:48.720
Monsieur is talking to a cow.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.480
What have you done to your nose?

26:50.480 --> 26:51.920
You punched me.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.360
Don't be ridiculous.
Have you met Boris?

26:54.360 --> 26:57.440
Boris plays violin for the
Philharmonic Society of London.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.280
Strictly speaking, second violin,
but he's still very good.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.320
You're very good.
Mr Fogg?

27:03.320 --> 27:04.760
Miss Fix!

27:04.760 --> 27:07.080
Have you FIXED everything?

27:09.800 --> 27:11.440
What's happening? Is he sick?

27:11.440 --> 27:12.600
I don't know.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.880
I'll get my mother,
she'll know what to do.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.240
FOGG HUMS

27:21.480 --> 27:25.000
# Oh, the roast beef of old
England... #

27:25.000 --> 27:28.480
It's so unlike him.
Maybe he's a secret drinker.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.120
We can't just do nothing.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.640
I'm a manservant, not a doctor.

27:32.640 --> 27:36.000
# ..and old English roast beef. #

27:36.000 --> 27:38.240
Come on!
Monsieur.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.400
This is a cow.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.440
# ..and old English roast beef. #
Come, Monsieur.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.600
Everybody!

27:44.600 --> 27:47.800
Mr Fogg. Mr Fogg...

27:47.800 --> 27:54.640
# ..and old English roast beef. #

27:56.360 --> 27:58.320
Come on.I love you. This way.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.520
Sorry. Let's go!

28:01.520 --> 28:03.640
DOG BARKS

28:06.280 --> 28:08.280
THUNDER

28:08.280 --> 28:09.680
Has he been drinking?

28:09.680 --> 28:12.600
Just tea.
Is it typhoid?

28:12.600 --> 28:15.120
I am Alexander of Macedon.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.720
Who gave me unmixed wine?

28:19.360 --> 28:20.840
Please, be careful.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.280
Monsieur.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.520
Come down.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.360
FOGG CALLS OUT

28:29.680 --> 28:31.360
Mr Fogg!

28:34.120 --> 28:36.720
I think he's having a convulsion.
Do something!

28:36.720 --> 28:39.840
I can't help him if I don't
know what's wrong with him.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.480
I've never seen a man so sick.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.400
Well, if anybody can help him,
it will be my mother.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.000
I think he may have taken this.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.280
You...think?

28:55.280 --> 28:56.600
I know.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.240
I'm here, Mr Fogg, we're all here.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.800
Why would he take datura seeds?

29:02.800 --> 29:05.120
I took a bribe to slow him down.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.920
The man said it would send him
to sleep for a day or two.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.600
How much did you give him?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.640
One of those?

29:14.680 --> 29:17.280
You better hope it doesn't
put him to sleep forever.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.480
Please. Help him.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.640
It's just water.
Please.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.640
Keep him cool and keep him awake.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.720
If he falls asleep, he may
never wake up.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.560
Samanaz, I need your help
with the medicine.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.640
That's right, Monsieur,
just stay awake.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.800
Medicine for what?
This makes no sense.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.360
When I left him
he was perfectly fine.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.960
It is not a vest, matron,

29:47.960 --> 29:49.960
it is clearly a
sleeveless undershirt.

29:52.080 --> 29:55.800
We are in the land of elephants
and gods...

29:57.960 --> 29:59.480
..and elephant gods.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.640
HE CHOKES

30:01.640 --> 30:03.360
No, Monsieur, no, no!

30:13.120 --> 30:14.760
I'll get him some more water.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.320
He's hot, so hot.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.920
Keep him awake.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.840
Mr Fogg?

30:30.040 --> 30:31.880
THUNDER

31:09.800 --> 31:12.200
Stay with me, Mr Fogg.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.280
Please, Mr Fogg.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.400
Phileas.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.880
Phileas.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.040
Estella?

31:23.040 --> 31:24.480
No, it's me. Abigail.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.440
My darling Estella, you came back.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.760
I always knew you would.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.360
I always knew...
No, I didn't know, but I hoped.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.280
I dreamed.
Mr Fogg...

31:39.280 --> 31:41.640
Feel my heart, Estella.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.320
It has always been yours.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.200
Waiting for you.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.720
Now you're finally here,
I can tell you everything.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.080
I'm... I'm travelling the world...

31:57.880 --> 31:59.600
..like we planned.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.200
France, Italy.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.000
I've had such adventures.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.920
I flew across the Alps.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.920
I saved a young boy's life.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.640
That's wonderful.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.080
I just want you to be proud of me.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.360
Just once.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.480
You see, Estella,

32:23.480 --> 32:25.680
I've been alone for such
a very long time.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.840
You were right to go.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.440
To leave me.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.280
I could never have been
good enough for you.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.520
I think you knew that
from the start.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.000
I think we both knew.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.760
What are you doing? Wake him up!

33:00.760 --> 33:02.440
I'm sorry, I...

33:02.440 --> 33:03.720
Wake up. Please!

33:06.320 --> 33:07.520
Get him up.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.600
How is he?

33:20.600 --> 33:21.760
He nearly slept.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.720
I'm sorry.
Sit him down.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.000
He must drink this.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.280
Make sure he drinks all of it.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.680
Only then can we let him sleep.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.160
Thank you.
Do not thank me yet.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.160
Has he ever mentioned anyone
called Estella to you?

33:54.160 --> 33:55.840
No.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.080
He thought I was her.
He thought I was Genghis Khan.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.160
No, this was real.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.320
I could see the emotion in his eyes.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.000
It was incredibly powerful.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.920
He looked at me with such love,
such adoration.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.120
Maybe a puppy he was
given for Christmas.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.560
There was someone in his life
called Estella,

34:15.560 --> 34:17.880
someone he very clearly loved.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.480
I think they were meant
to travel the world together,

34:20.480 --> 34:22.920
but she ended their relationship
and went off on her own.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.960
I just can't imagine Fogg being
with a woman, can you?

34:27.280 --> 34:29.000
I will try very hard not to.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.760
I don't think we're here because of
a silly bet in the Reform Club.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.720
I think we're here
because once upon a time,

34:34.720 --> 34:37.920
Phileas Fogg loved
a woman called Estella.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.080
No. We are here,

34:40.080 --> 34:42.120
risking our lives, risking his,

34:42.120 --> 34:43.760
because he took a stupid wager.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.080
You're wrong, Passepartout,
I feel sure of it.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.400
We're here because
a woman broke his heart.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.440
Estella...

35:49.040 --> 35:51.200
BUGLE BLOWS

36:15.960 --> 36:17.400
Oh, hello.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.280
Oh!

36:21.440 --> 36:23.720
Thank you.
You're awake!

36:23.720 --> 36:26.400
Oh! Did something happen last night?

36:26.400 --> 36:29.720
Everyone's so inordinately pleased
to see me. As am I, sir.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.560
You are alive.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.960
Well, I feel like an elderly badger
has died in my mouth, but

36:34.960 --> 36:36.360
I'm very much alive, yes.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.760
I will send for our best guide.
Guide?

36:38.760 --> 36:41.080
To take you to your train
at Allahabad.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.920
Well, I believe I have some other
business to attend to first.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.000
I need to speak to the Lieutenant
about young Arjan.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.040
You already did.
Did I? How did it go?

36:50.040 --> 36:52.760
Um, he showed you a picture
of his fiancee and you laughed.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.760
When's the boy's court martial?
Now.Now?!

37:00.400 --> 37:01.920
You're up, Arjan.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.520
All the boys are rooting for you.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.960
The last thing I remember clearly is
drinking some tea and then...

37:15.960 --> 37:18.400
The food was very spicy.
Perhaps some sort of reaction.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.800
It wasn't the food. You were
absolutely doolally.Was I?

37:20.800 --> 37:22.440
You really don't remember anything?

37:22.440 --> 37:25.440
Just some dreams. Very vivid dreams.
Did I say anything?

37:25.440 --> 37:27.040
No. Nothing.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.600
All rise.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.360
This court is in session.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.560
Lieutenant Aldous Cecil
Bathurst presiding.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.000
This summary court martial
is hereby ordered

37:48.000 --> 37:50.480
to convene on this day,
the 3rd of November,

37:50.480 --> 37:53.200
in the year of our Lord 1872.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.880
Sepoy Arjan Anand,
you are charged with

37:55.880 --> 37:58.400
the crime of desertion
of your post whilst on duty

37:58.400 --> 38:00.040
with Her Majesty's Army.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.760
How do you plea?

38:02.760 --> 38:04.280
Guilty, sir.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.480
MURMURING

38:06.480 --> 38:08.600
Very well.

38:08.600 --> 38:11.000
Before we move to sentencing,
do you have anything you wish

38:11.000 --> 38:12.960
to say by way of mitigation?

38:12.960 --> 38:14.960
Sir, if I may,

38:14.960 --> 38:18.120
I have prepared something that I
would like to read to the court.

38:26.680 --> 38:30.240
When I first went to
Narupani, my intention was only

38:30.240 --> 38:33.120
to follow the orders
I had been given -

38:33.120 --> 38:35.680
to conduct a census
of the local people.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.840
Those were MY orders.
You disobeyed my orders.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.880
I did not disobey them
lightly, sir.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.680
But disobey them you did.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.840
Because I knew we would be
moving out afterwards,

38:45.840 --> 38:48.680
and that would mean
a lifetime of unhappiness,

38:48.680 --> 38:52.000
knowing that I would never see
the woman that I love again.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.320
I believe I am of good character.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.400
My service record shows
several distinctions,

39:05.400 --> 39:08.480
including one for bravery during
the floods in Maharashtra.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.880
I respectfully ask the court
to consider this,

39:14.880 --> 39:16.520
and ask for mercy in sentencing.

39:24.240 --> 39:27.400
Your statement has been
noted, Sepoy.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.280
Nonetheless, the crime you have
pleaded guilty to is amongst

39:30.280 --> 39:32.760
the most serious any soldier
could commit.

39:32.760 --> 39:33.920
Wait!

39:35.440 --> 39:37.480
I object!

39:39.280 --> 39:40.960
To what?

39:40.960 --> 39:42.800
I'm not sure yet. I just do.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.560
You are not an army officer,

39:44.560 --> 39:46.920
you are not an elected advocate,

39:46.920 --> 39:49.160
you have no right
to speak in this court.

39:49.160 --> 39:51.560
Where is the officer who will
speak for Arjan?

39:51.560 --> 39:54.480
There is not another
British officer for 100 miles.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.320
I will undertake that role myself.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.920
Judge, jury and executioner?

39:58.920 --> 40:01.960
Arjan, tell him that you want
Mr Fogg to speak on your behalf.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.200
Well... Yes.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.960
Sir, I wish for this man
to speak on my behalf.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.640
Very well, I will make an exception.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.320
The floor is yours, Mr Fogg.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.800
Go.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.760
FOGG CLEARS THROAT

40:24.760 --> 40:26.320
Morning. Um...

40:29.240 --> 40:31.360
Your Honour....
I am not a judge.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.200
Sir. Um...

40:38.040 --> 40:41.240
Uh... First of all, I should start
with an apology.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.920
Um... When you showed me
the photograph of your fiancee,

40:43.920 --> 40:47.360
I'm told I may have laughed...
SOLDIERS CHUCKLE

40:47.360 --> 40:49.160
..which is completely ridiculous, as

40:49.160 --> 40:51.160
she's a very fine-looking
young woman.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.880
This is a military hearing, Mr Fogg.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.760
You will kindly keep
my fiancee out of it.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.280
When I spoke to you last night,
I was not well,

40:59.280 --> 41:00.920
I was not myself,

41:00.920 --> 41:04.200
and I would hate your
bad opinion of me

41:04.200 --> 41:06.600
to colour your opinion
of Sepoy Anand.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.000
Get on with it, man.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.000
Can I have some water?

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Tell him no-one should be punished
for falling in love.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.600
HE CLEARS THROAT

41:19.880 --> 41:21.440
Sir.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.120
Sepoy Anand is innocent.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.240
No, no, he is not,
we've already established that.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.120
Have we?
Yes, sir, guilty as charged.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.320
Right.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.280
I've got nothing to say.
It's about character.

41:36.280 --> 41:39.080
I barely know him.
You know yourself.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.680
It's in here.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.720
This is a waste of time.
Sepoy Anand,

41:45.720 --> 41:48.320
you may believe that abandoning
your company in pursuit of

41:48.320 --> 41:51.280
a woman makes you some kind
of romantic hero.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.840
It does not.
It makes you a deserter.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.080
You are not a hero,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.040
you are a coward.

41:59.040 --> 42:01.800
Whether in peace time or in war,
desertion is inexcusable...

42:01.800 --> 42:04.320
I object!
Will you stop objecting?!

42:04.320 --> 42:07.480
No, dammit, I will not!
I object to that word!

42:07.480 --> 42:10.440
This man risked everything -
his reputation,

42:10.440 --> 42:12.080
his career...

42:13.720 --> 42:15.560
..his freedom,

42:15.560 --> 42:17.040
to be with the woman he loved.

42:20.840 --> 42:24.520
Have you seen action yet,
Lieutenant Bathurst?

42:24.520 --> 42:26.480
That is neither here nor there.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.440
When you do...

42:32.960 --> 42:35.800
..when you hear the screams of
your wounded comrades...

42:37.400 --> 42:41.320
..and the smoke and the sweat

42:41.320 --> 42:44.920
and the blood in your eyes
and the whine of the bullets

42:44.920 --> 42:47.040
and the slash of the sword...

42:49.160 --> 42:52.280
..when you lead these fine
men into the teeth of the enemy...

42:52.280 --> 42:53.840
For God's sake, man, spit it out!

42:53.840 --> 42:55.080
..what will push you on?

42:56.120 --> 42:58.520
Duty? Orders?

42:59.720 --> 43:01.200
A flag?

43:01.200 --> 43:04.080
Or will it be the thought of seeing

43:04.080 --> 43:06.280
the people you love one more time?

43:07.400 --> 43:09.600
The face of a fiancee, perhaps.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.200
The face of Penelope.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.800
Yes?

43:12.800 --> 43:14.680
Sepoy Anand was faced
with the same prospect.

43:14.680 --> 43:18.440
He was not faced with death.
He may as well have been.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.400
To have lived the rest
of his life without

43:20.400 --> 43:22.920
the woman he loves,

43:22.920 --> 43:25.440
knowing she's out there,

43:25.440 --> 43:28.280
and knowing he'll never
see her again.

43:28.280 --> 43:30.840
He's a young man,
it was too much for him.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.640
You think love is
a legitimate reason to desert?

43:33.640 --> 43:36.360
Oh, I think it's the best
possible reason.

43:39.440 --> 43:42.000
When you have found love,

43:42.000 --> 43:43.360
real love...

43:46.560 --> 43:48.800
..life without it has no purpose.

43:50.200 --> 43:53.080
So you will fight with every shred
of strength you possess.

43:53.080 --> 43:56.520
You will ignore orders
and the people that give them.

43:57.920 --> 44:01.360
You will disregard common sense

44:01.360 --> 44:03.560
and the done thing

44:03.560 --> 44:05.400
and the words of your friends.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.840
You will do whatever it takes
to hold on to it.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.720
And if you do not, then...

44:11.240 --> 44:13.600
..THEN you're a coward.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.080
I took a commission from
the Queen...

44:16.080 --> 44:19.000
Well, the Queen would understand.
The Queen would agree.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.160
She, of all people, knows what it's
like to have loved and lost.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.280
If it were Penelope...

44:39.080 --> 44:41.240
..can you honestly say you would
have behaved

44:41.240 --> 44:42.720
any differently to this man?

45:10.080 --> 45:11.760
Sepoy, ten-shun!

45:13.360 --> 45:14.840
Sepoy Arjan Anand...

45:16.640 --> 45:19.160
..I hereby sentence you

45:19.160 --> 45:21.120
to be dishonourably discharged

45:21.120 --> 45:22.880
from Her Majesty's Army.

45:22.880 --> 45:26.160
You will forfeit all privileges
and pay with immediate effect.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.920
Sir?

45:27.920 --> 45:29.880
Get out of my sight.

45:29.880 --> 45:33.320
CHEERING

45:48.360 --> 45:51.160
She's a very beautiful woman,
Lieutenant.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.720
Go home and marry her.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.400
Thank you so much.
You're very welcome.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.120
Well done, Mr Fogg!

46:05.120 --> 46:06.640
Rather surprised myself.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.000
Right.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.320
For you.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.480
Are you sure?
Of course.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.520
You can wear it for
your own wedding.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.560
I'm sorry we can't stay longer.

46:56.560 --> 46:59.960
Apparently we have a new expedition
leader and he's very strict.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.560
When you're ready, Miss Fix.

47:03.560 --> 47:06.280
Time and estuary wait for no man.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.360
Or woman.

47:08.360 --> 47:10.440
Tide!
Oui-oui.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.360
Not in a million years.

47:18.880 --> 47:22.280
Come on, Monsieur Fogg,
we have a train to catch.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.880
Thank you, Aouda,
for saving my life.

47:29.400 --> 47:32.720
I hope you find what
you're looking for, Mr Fogg.
