I'm kidding, Tom.

Are we really
fucking doing this?

16:00.994 --> 16:02.529
Are we really having
this conversation?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.398
Could happen.

DONALD:
What do you want me to say?

16:15.108 --> 16:17.610
That I'd be devastated?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.156
What would you do if I died?

16:31.524 --> 16:32.959
I'd be devastated.

I just gotta take a leak.
That's all.

DEFENSE LAWYER:
Given the recent evidence
provided by the court

19:12.285 --> 19:14.421
and my client,
that the witness

19:14.521 --> 19:16.022
you're about to see has been
deemed the legal descendant

19:16.122 --> 19:17.089

19:17.190 --> 19:19.626
she should not be forced
to testify.

PROSECUTION LAWYER:
There is proof and testimony

that the witness
we're about to see has had

19:24.163 --> 19:25.832
sexual relations
with Donald Fairchild.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.268

intercourse with anyone

Given these bizarre
circumstances, I understand
