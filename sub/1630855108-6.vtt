01:56.741 --> 01:59.577
<i>Jury selection begins today
in the murder trial</i>

01:59.577 --> 02:02.664
<i>of Texas housewife Candy Montgomery.</i>

02:02.664 --> 02:05.667
<i>Almost four months to the day
that Betty Gore,</i>

02:05.667 --> 02:09.128
<i>30-year-old mother of two,
was found chopped to death</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:10.505
<i>in her own home.</i>

02:10.505 --> 02:13.007
<i>The trial itself is expected
to start tomorrow,</i>

02:13.007 --> 02:15.844
<i>when the prosecution
swears in its first witness.</i>

02:28.940 --> 02:30.817
Knock, knock!

02:30.817 --> 02:31.860
Hey.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.654
How we doin'?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.615
Got any big plans for today?

02:40.618 --> 02:43.329
- I really do love the hair.
- Thank you.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.915
You are gonna be okay, honey.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.835
I don't think I've ever felt
so dependent on other people

02:48.835 --> 02:50.336
as I do right now.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.630
Hey, Sherry.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.717
- Hey, Pat.
- Pat, do you think I look okay?

02:56.551 --> 02:58.595
This is what Don Crowder wants me to wear.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.096
Yeah. Yeah, you look fine.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.973
How are you doin', Pat?

03:04.893 --> 03:07.020
I'm good. Good.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.230
You know, it's--

03:11.065 --> 03:12.025
I'll get it.

03:20.825 --> 03:21.659
Hey.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.704
We set?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.126
All right.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.713
Hey, why can't I go inside with her?

03:35.214 --> 03:37.800
Only the parties and lawyers
can get side access.

03:38.801 --> 03:39.802
Sorry.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.265
- I'll be right behind you.
- I know you will.

03:47.018 --> 03:47.852
Okay.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.898
Sherry, make sure that the kids
don't watch the news.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.900
- Of course. I promise.
- Okay.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.864
- Doing all right?
- Oh yeah, fine. How are you?

04:00.615 --> 04:01.658
Good.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.875
As you can see behind me,
people are lining up to get in.

04:10.875 --> 04:15.046
This is clearly the hottest ticket
in what is normally a sleepy town.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.840
The reason Judge Ryan
moved it to the old courthouse,

04:17.840 --> 04:18.841
it holds more people.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.053
What do Texas prisons look like?

04:24.806 --> 04:26.933
There are two women's prisons.

04:26.933 --> 04:27.976
I think that's her!

04:27.976 --> 04:30.687
There's one that you definitely
do not want to go to.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.274
The other one is not that bad.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.276
How do they decide which one you go to?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.823
You'd go to the good one.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.411
Oh, my God.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.379
Oh, my God.
I don't think I can do this.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.591
Yes, you will.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.757
<i>We may ask you a bunch of questions.</i>

05:40.757 --> 05:45.386
The idea is to wind up
with 12 impartial jurors

05:45.386 --> 05:48.806
who can evaluate the evidence
in an unbiased manner.

05:49.432 --> 05:52.310
Now, if you're not selected,
don't take it personally.

05:53.269 --> 05:57.190
It's very important that you understand
not just what this proceeding is about,

05:57.190 --> 05:59.650
but also what it's not about.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.195
It's not a personality contest

06:02.195 --> 06:04.822
or a question of who you think
should win or lose

06:04.822 --> 06:06.866
or does the best job.

06:07.450 --> 06:11.621
The best job is the decision
you make on the evidence,

06:12.163 --> 06:15.083
and only the evidence that
you hear in this courtroom.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.335
Now, Judge Ryan has gone over the outline

06:17.335 --> 06:19.837
of what the indictment is to you
in a murder case.

06:20.671 --> 06:24.175
The ultimate fact issue
to be proved to a jury

06:25.134 --> 06:27.929
is that a defendant killed the deceased.

06:31.099 --> 06:35.019
Alright then. We're gonna let Mr. Crowder
make a remark or two. Mr. Crowder?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.735
My name is Don Crowder.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.823
First, I'd like to thank each
and every one of you for bein' here.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.700
Your commitment to public service.

06:51.077 --> 06:55.873
There is no greater strand of fabric
to criminal justice,

06:55.873 --> 06:59.127
to democracy itself, than jury duty.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.629
Now

07:02.755 --> 07:05.007
it's not proper for me
to discuss the facts

07:05.007 --> 07:06.926
with you at this time.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.970
Mr. O'Connell didn't talk
about 'em either.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.098
But

07:12.807 --> 07:15.560
there is somethin' I've gotta tell you now

07:15.560 --> 07:18.020
for me to be able to discuss the law.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.360
On Friday, June 13th, 1980,

07:25.361 --> 07:27.238
Candace Montgomery killed Betty Gore.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.824
She did so with an axe.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.453
And she did so in self-defense.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.583
We haven't chosen to
try our case in the papers,

07:38.583 --> 07:40.960
which is why you've
never heard that before.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.129
But we've got quite a story to tell.

07:44.088 --> 07:48.801
You're gonna hear what happened that day,
June 13th, and guess what?

07:49.635 --> 07:53.472
You're gonna hear it from the only
living person who was there.

07:53.472 --> 07:56.559
Candy Montgomery will take the stand.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.061
She'll tell you exactly what happened.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.608
Of course, a few of them were stunned.
Who wouldn't be?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.194
The truth can be a shocking thing.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.362
Y'all better buckle up.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.617
For anyone comin' to this
with preconceived notions,

08:12.617 --> 08:14.410
buckle up and get ready.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.662
That's all I got.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.209
Ron.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.502
Listen.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.129
Seems they're not gonna
let you in the room

08:25.129 --> 08:26.297
since you might be a witness.

08:27.006 --> 08:31.010
Unfortunate, because it's very important
the jury know from the get-go

08:31.010 --> 08:33.095
that God is in Candy's corner.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.098
That truth shouldn't have to wait
till you testify.

08:37.183 --> 08:41.020
It would be good for the jury
to hear from God, Pastor,

08:41.020 --> 08:42.563
even if it's on television.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.274
- I understand.
- Good man.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.288
Hey.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.624
- Pat. Hey.
- Don.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.543
Chin up, man.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.546
A lot of folks gonna be
takin' their cues from you.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.674
Come on, now.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.551
It's just everybody's looking at me
like I've been

09:14.887 --> 09:17.181
cuckolded, and the whole world--

09:17.181 --> 09:19.100
Okay, look.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.935
Doesn't matter if she fucked 100 men.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.688
Long as she doesn't do it again, right?

09:25.147 --> 09:26.565
And she won't.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.651
Come on now.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.404
Chin up.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.453
<i>I'm sure it'll be on the news.</i>

09:39.453 --> 09:41.664
They're saying that Betty tried to kill
that woman.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.834
- I guess so.
- <i>Well, that just--</i>

09:44.834 --> 09:46.794
That just doesn't make sense.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.256
<i>That's something you'd say right away.</i>

09:50.256 --> 09:53.426
"I had to do it." Four months?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.386
Yeah. Yeah.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.014
Well, I'm coming down there for the trial.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.850
<i>Bertha, she</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:03.144
she can't bring herself to.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.148
But I'm coming.

10:08.024 --> 10:08.983
<i>Okay.</i>

10:09.525 --> 10:10.943
Alright. Bye.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.892
Everybody's being just so quiet.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.353
With Halloween right around the corner?
Ian?

10:46.187 --> 10:48.522
Honey,
will we be going with "Star Wars" again?

10:48.522 --> 10:50.441
I don't know. Everybody's "Star Wars."

10:50.441 --> 10:53.611
Sally Reynolds,
she says she wants to go as you

10:53.611 --> 10:55.613
but her parents won't let her.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.331
That's not appropriate dinner talk
at the table, young lady.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.883
You think it was wise for Don
to just announce

11:15.883 --> 11:17.551
that you did it like that?

11:17.551 --> 11:18.719
We agreed.

11:18.719 --> 11:19.929
No trial talk either.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.474
I'm just worried
he may not be up for this.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.813
You know what? I'll get that.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.160
Hi, Jackie.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.163
Can you and I have a private word?

11:58.092 --> 12:01.220
Well, if I knew that you were comin',
I could have put a--

12:01.220 --> 12:03.431
She tried to kill you. That's your story?

12:07.351 --> 12:08.269
Yeah. It's true.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.855
I refuse to believe that.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.483
Why did you keep that from me?

12:15.526 --> 12:17.736
I had to. Don said--

12:17.736 --> 12:19.238
Don said, did he?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.240
You know, I never lied to you.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.658
Yes, you did!

12:22.658 --> 12:26.078
I asked you point-blank,
and you lied to me!

12:26.078 --> 12:31.876
I didn't murder Betty Gore.
You have to believe me.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.794
No.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.839
I don't.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.558
It would be good if you were there for me.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.019
At trial.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.026
That won't be happenin', Candy.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.451
I drove six hours.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.995
If I go in and come right back out?

13:08.662 --> 13:09.788
I just wanna see her.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.790
Sorry, ma'am.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.929
Before we all get started,
I have one other matter.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.431
Counsel will recall
that on the 12th day of July,

13:27.431 --> 13:30.100
this court issued an order
restricting counsel

13:30.100 --> 13:31.810
from talkin' to the media.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.772
After jury selection yesterday,

13:34.772 --> 13:37.525
seems Mr. Crowder
held himself a little presser,

13:37.525 --> 13:41.278
jabberin' on to whoever
was handy to listen.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.698
Likely 'cause you've never tried yourself
a criminal case before.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.034
Anything you'd like to say to me,
Mr. Crowder?

13:49.578 --> 13:51.789
Your Honor,
I thought that the order had been lifted.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.916
Especially since last Friday,

13:53.916 --> 13:57.127
you invited the media into your chambers
for a photo shoot.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.546
I might also ask--

13:58.546 --> 14:00.965
You're not asking this court a question,
Mr. Crowder.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.386
I asked you if you would
like to make a statement.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.845
And I'm responding.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.099
It was my impression
that the gag order was lifted.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.142
Well, you got that wrong.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.188
This court finds you in contempt
for violation of its order

14:16.188 --> 14:19.149
that was entered
on the 11th day of July, 1980.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.777
This thing isn't about your limelight,
Mr. Crowder.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.905
Ain't that the pot calling
the kettle a grandstander?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.949
Movin' the trial to this buildin',

14:26.949 --> 14:28.492
so you could get yourself on television.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.997
Your punishment is assessed
at a $100 fine, plus costs,

14:32.997 --> 14:35.040
plus 24 hours in the Collin County jail.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.543
- Are you kiddin' me?
- Out of abundance of precaution,

14:37.543 --> 14:39.128
so your confinement will not interfere

14:39.128 --> 14:41.213
with your proper representation
of your client,

14:41.213 --> 14:43.340
I will suspend the issue
of that commitment

14:43.340 --> 14:45.884
until the day next preceding
the conclusion of this trial

14:46.802 --> 14:48.512
at which time
a writ of commitment will issue.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.931
Well, howdy-doody, Judge.

14:51.890 --> 14:52.766
What did you say?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.357
Bring in the jury.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.743
Prosecution calls Allan Gore.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.509
I'd been calling her all day.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.056
And I knew something wasn't right
with her not answering.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.392
And at some point,
you called your neighbor, Richard Parker?

15:36.101 --> 15:38.729
Yes, I made several calls and asked

15:39.647 --> 15:41.315
that he go look.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.400
Look in the house.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.904
And what, if anything, did he find?

15:47.988 --> 15:52.451
They found Betty dead.
I was told that she was shot.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.620
Who told you she'd been shot dead?

15:55.412 --> 15:56.622
Jerry McMahan.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.000
After Jerry McMahan told you
Betty'd been shot,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.877
did you make any further calls?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.713
I

16:04.713 --> 16:06.507
called Candace Montgomery.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.344
What, if anything, did you tell her?

16:11.428 --> 16:12.846
I told her

16:14.264 --> 16:15.641
Betty'd been killed.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.353
After you told the defendant
that your wife had been killed,

16:19.353 --> 16:22.064
what response, if any, did she make?

16:23.273 --> 16:25.401
It seemed like a normal shock reaction.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.696
She didn't say that she killed Betty

16:28.696 --> 16:30.531
in self-defense with an axe?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.199
No.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.536
Your Honor, may I approach?

16:41.458 --> 16:44.962
Let me show you
what's been marked for identification

16:45.671 --> 16:48.465
as State's Exhibit number K6.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.762
Let me ask you to look at that exhibit.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.098
Tell the jury whether
that looks familiar to you.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.600
It looks like my axe.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.229
Do you see anything other
than what may be on it

17:02.229 --> 17:04.773
that would be inconsistent
with being your axe?

17:07.401 --> 17:08.318
No.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.410
Now.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.665
Sir. You know the defendant?

17:23.167 --> 17:25.669
- Yes.
- And, at some point,

17:25.669 --> 17:28.255
you two became involved
in a sexual affair?

17:28.797 --> 17:31.759
Yes, in the fall of 1978.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.054
Over what period of time did you
two engage in a sexual affair?

17:37.181 --> 17:42.144
From about early December '78
until October '79.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.147
- What caused it to stop?
- It stopped

17:45.898 --> 17:49.276
because I decided I didn't feel like
I could share myself

17:50.360 --> 17:51.361
with Candy.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.572
I wanted to concentrate on my own family.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.202
Had you told your wife
about the relationship with the defendant?

17:58.994 --> 18:00.120
No, I did not.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.916
Did you have any reason to believe
Betty knew about the affair?

18:05.042 --> 18:06.794
No, I did not.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.882
But you can't rule it out,
that Betty could've known.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.051
I can't rule it out. No.

18:15.344 --> 18:20.724
And on June 13th, the morning of,
how did she seem? Your wife.

18:20.724 --> 18:24.812
She was a bit agitated.
I was going away on a business trip.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.396
And that would always unsettle her.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.567
Unsettled. Agitated. Was she depressed?

18:30.567 --> 18:31.693
Perhaps.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.821
She'd battled depression before.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.448
She had some postpartum.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.159
Plus, as I said, when I would travel--

18:39.159 --> 18:41.411
And on the morning of June 13th,

18:41.411 --> 18:43.914
did she seem agitated
or depressed over anything,

18:43.914 --> 18:46.041
besides your goin' away
on a business trip?

18:46.041 --> 18:47.543
Yes, she

18:49.503 --> 18:52.297
she thought she might be pregnant.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.175
And this was causing her stress?

18:57.094 --> 18:59.137
- Yes.
- In fact, you were a bit worried

18:59.137 --> 19:01.139
about Betty
and her state of mind that day.

19:01.139 --> 19:06.061
So much so that, as you testified,
you made repeated calls

19:06.061 --> 19:07.855
to check on her.
From the airport,

19:07.855 --> 19:09.940
your hotel.
You repeatedly called.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.359
- I did.
- And sir,

19:12.359 --> 19:16.113
on the night of your wife's death,
when you called the Montgomery House,

19:16.113 --> 19:19.533
did you tell Mrs. Montgomery
that you were very concerned

19:19.533 --> 19:21.660
that your wife had committed suicide?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.205
I don't recall saying that

19:25.998 --> 19:28.625
but the thought had entered my mind. Yes.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.130
She could have very dark thoughts,
your wife.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.506
Yes.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.677
Your wife and Candy Montgomery

19:38.677 --> 19:40.220
- were friends?
- They were.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.265
- Fair to say they were good friends?
- Yes.

19:44.349 --> 19:49.897
And prior to June 13th, 1980,
had you ever been aware of any cross words

19:49.897 --> 19:51.315
between Betty and Candy?

19:51.940 --> 19:54.860
- No.
- Had they had any physical fight

19:54.860 --> 19:57.321
before June 13th, 1980?

19:58.071 --> 20:00.324
- No.
- Any verbal altercation?

20:00.991 --> 20:03.619
- No.
- Can you think of any reason

20:03.619 --> 20:06.622
why Candy would wanna harm your wife?

20:07.372 --> 20:08.290
No.

20:12.586 --> 20:16.465
Your relationship with Candy Montgomery.

20:17.674 --> 20:20.093
This started out
as an affair of the flesh?

20:20.093 --> 20:20.928
Yes.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.138
Did it end up being something different?

20:23.138 --> 20:26.183
We became very good friends.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.436
This was not any torrid love thing,
was it?

20:29.436 --> 20:31.188
- No.
- You never discussed

20:31.188 --> 20:33.231
marriage or running away
from your families?

20:34.733 --> 20:35.567
No.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.653
Never talked about gettin' divorced
from your spouses?

20:39.863 --> 20:42.282
- Never.
- This was not some

20:43.116 --> 20:45.619
whirlwind romance.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.663
In fact, sometimes during your rendezvous,

20:47.663 --> 20:49.331
you two wouldn't even have sex.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.625
You'd just talk.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.794
That's correct.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.922
Fact of the matter is, Mr. Gore,

20:56.922 --> 20:59.716
neither one of you were very good at this,
were you?

21:01.385 --> 21:02.344
No.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.847
And when it finally petered out,
were there hard feelings?

21:07.182 --> 21:09.393
- No.
- Not by you? Not by Candy?

21:10.310 --> 21:12.229
- No.
- She wasn't tryin' to get back with you?

21:13.105 --> 21:16.900
- No.
- Does it make any sense to you whatsoever

21:16.900 --> 21:20.112
that Candace Montgomery
would have got in her car

21:20.654 --> 21:22.614
on June 13th, 1980,

21:22.614 --> 21:25.325
and drove to your house
to murder your wife

21:25.325 --> 21:27.411
for the purpose of getting you back?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.248
- No.
- Murder her for any reason?

21:31.873 --> 21:32.624
No.

21:33.166 --> 21:39.131
Now, you testified that the axe
was hanging in your garage

21:39.131 --> 21:41.758
on the morning of June 13th when you left.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.471
To my knowledge, yes.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.849
And, to your knowledge,
had Candy Montgomery

21:48.849 --> 21:53.103
ever been in your garage
prior to June 30th, 1980?

21:53.103 --> 21:56.189
- Not to my knowledge.
- To your knowledge,

21:56.189 --> 22:00.944
would she have any reason to know
there was an axe in your garage?

22:00.944 --> 22:01.903
No.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.531
Your wife, of course, knew

22:05.907 --> 22:08.452
the axe was in your garage.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.415
Yes.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.086
<i>You might as well have been
a defense witness.</i>

22:19.296 --> 22:21.882
I was under oath.
I had to tell the truth.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.217
Pity you don't remember the oath
that you took with Betty.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.599
Well, that's not fair.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.975
She's dead, Allan.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.147
She got chopped up with an axe

22:38.190 --> 22:42.235
which never would have happened
if you hadn't cheated on her.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.572
And the woman who did this?

22:49.159 --> 22:50.869
You helped her today.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.831
Was that the plan?

22:55.665 --> 22:57.709
No, it was not the plan.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.712
You looked at that bloody axe

23:01.838 --> 23:03.882
and you had no reaction.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.260
You showed no remorse.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.518
Betty's dead.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.986
Why doesn't that bother you?

23:32.494 --> 23:34.913
We weren't getting along too well.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.922
I still think they were in on it together.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.383
He probably told her exactly
where she could find that axe.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.847
Stop your nonsense.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.892
Well, honest to God, Sherry,
sometimes I wonder

23:55.892 --> 23:58.186
if you were in on it, too.
The way you protect her.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.022
I said stop your nonsense

24:01.022 --> 24:02.232
and I mean it.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.491
This way, ladies.

24:11.491 --> 24:12.450
Okay. Thanks.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.798
Oh, my goodness.
This may be my best batch yet.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.217
Get some butter on them while they're hot.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.094
What else did he say? Don.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.971
- About how it went.
- Well, I told you,

24:32.971 --> 24:35.473
Don's not much talkin' to me.

24:35.473 --> 24:36.892
Yeah, why?

24:37.684 --> 24:40.270
Because he evidently
likes to keep his distance

24:40.270 --> 24:41.938
when the actual trial starts.

24:41.938 --> 24:45.150
But, Robert said it went very well.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.903
Can I have a popover before grace?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.571
No, you may not,

24:49.571 --> 24:52.657
but let's get grace over with
before that popover gets cold.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.286
We'd like to thank you, dear God,

24:56.286 --> 24:58.955
for this food which
we are about to receive,

24:58.955 --> 25:01.166
and thank you for your love.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.878
And for givin' me strength. Amen.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.504
Amen.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.887
I don't understand
why I can't be in the room.

25:13.887 --> 25:18.975
Because the judge said so, Pat.
Do you not listen?

25:18.975 --> 25:22.896
No witnesses or potential witnesses,
which you would be.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.857
So can we now just try
and enjoy our supper,

25:25.857 --> 25:29.486
which happens to include
some of my finest popovers ever?

25:30.487 --> 25:32.781
Can I ask one trial question?

25:34.241 --> 25:36.117
Is it hard?

25:38.328 --> 25:41.581
Yes, sweetie. It's very hard.

25:42.874 --> 25:46.795
But, life is sometimes
'cause it's meant to be.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.922
And we forge on.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.594
Right?

25:55.470 --> 25:57.264
We forge on.

25:58.682 --> 26:03.311
<i>We first saw the blood in the bathroom,
and then we heard the baby.</i>

26:03.311 --> 26:04.187
Bethany.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.022
She was in her crib,

26:06.564 --> 26:08.066
crying, covered in her feces.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.734
She'd been there a long time.

26:09.734 --> 26:13.989
Door was partially open,
so I looked inside and, and I saw.

26:14.906 --> 26:15.949
There was blood everywhere.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.659
A massive amount of blood.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.954
I saw her foot, the body,
and an axe on the floor.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.290
Mostly just blood.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.292
<i>On the walls. The floor.</i>

26:25.292 --> 26:28.753
Lester couldn't tell Allan, so I did.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.006
She left the church around 9:30.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.717
She got back around 11:30.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.594
<i>Said she'd been at Betty's
and lost track of the time.</i>

26:36.594 --> 26:39.681
She had on a dark brown shirt,

26:39.681 --> 26:42.517
<i>jeans, and blue sneakers.</i>

26:42.517 --> 26:44.728
She seemed normal when she got back.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.897
A little flustered over
missin' the puppet show,

26:47.897 --> 26:49.691
but, other than that,
she was just regular Candy.

26:49.691 --> 26:53.945
We cleaned the house the day after,
me and some of the other neighbors.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.906
We didn't want Allan to arrive home
and see it that way.

27:16.259 --> 27:19.012
- Mrs. Montgomery! Mrs. Montgomery!
- Not right now, folks.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.138
Please. Thank you.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.265
Excuse us. Not right now, folks.

27:25.602 --> 27:29.064
Mrs. Montgomery!
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

27:29.564 --> 27:30.648
Excuse me.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.159
What the hell are you on?

27:42.952 --> 27:43.870
I don't know what you mean.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.872
Don't lie to me, Candy.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.417
You're takin' somethin'. What is it?

27:50.210 --> 27:53.588
Serax.
It helps with my nerves.

27:53.588 --> 27:57.967
You need to understand somethin'
That kind of carnage?

27:57.967 --> 28:00.970
Prosecution aims to depict you as inhuman.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.765
You looking like a zombie
plays right into their hands.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.850
Do not get cross with me.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.519
Do not get cross?

28:07.519 --> 28:12.232
It's the newspapers that are callin' me
a zombie and a monster.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.901
And they all want me to break down
and act like one, don't they?

28:15.777 --> 28:18.154
They would all just be so thrilled
if I jumped

28:18.154 --> 28:19.781
up and down and screamed.

28:21.324 --> 28:24.744
I will not be giving them
that satisfaction.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.871
If you look shut-down and robotic,

28:26.871 --> 28:29.165
- you go to jail.
- Well, I have to hold it together.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.501
Otherwise...

28:39.342 --> 28:45.098
No more Serax, Candy.
The jury needs to see you as human.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.808
Vulnerable.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.728
They won't find in your favor
unless they want to.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.442
If you need to cry, cry.

28:55.442 --> 28:58.027
But unfeeling buys you prison.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.073
I thought you weren't gonna talk to me
once the trial started.

29:07.662 --> 29:09.706
That's the last thing I'm gonna say.

29:17.046 --> 29:18.965
He's probably not wrong.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.926
The jury needs to see you as human.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.637
That's not possible.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.932
If you had any idea what was being said.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.311
I wish I could be in there.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.313
I'm glad you're not because

29:35.148 --> 29:38.485
I don't think that I could look at myself
through your eyes

29:38.485 --> 29:40.737
if you were hearin' what was bein' said.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.780
As bad as what the newspapers are sayin'.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.450
Well.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.251
You never told me

29:57.837 --> 30:02.050
what you thought
after Don told you on the phone

30:03.718 --> 30:05.136
what happened.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.098
I can't imagine what you must think.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.560
I'm not sure I want to.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.898
I'm just

30:20.777 --> 30:22.195
grateful

30:24.572 --> 30:26.491
that it didn't go the other way, you know?

30:29.285 --> 30:31.829
Betty was bigger than you.

30:31.829 --> 30:34.165
It could have easily gone the other way.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.556
It's okay to be a little bit broken,

30:49.556 --> 30:51.558
- Candy.
- No, it's not.

30:53.518 --> 30:58.606
Because if I let myself be that,
I might never get back.

31:00.858 --> 31:02.986
I'd never be unbroken.

31:05.530 --> 31:09.742
Tomorrow's gonna be a lot worse.
All the police detectives.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.837
You just have to be

31:22.255 --> 31:23.298
strong.

31:27.260 --> 31:31.222
There was a time when I thought
that this was it, you know?

31:31.681 --> 31:33.474
Everything.

31:33.474 --> 31:36.477
Just to be able to
stand underneath the stars.

31:37.604 --> 31:38.771
A home.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.149
A family.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.694
And people go lookin' for somethin'.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.907
They don't even know what it is.
They just want.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.371
And they go lookin'.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.585
At the end of some rainbow, maybe.

32:09.177 --> 32:13.931
<i>The Lord is not just my shepherd,
but he is also Candy Montgomery's.</i>

32:13.931 --> 32:17.101
<i>It comes down to goodness
and mercy in the heart.</i>

32:18.019 --> 32:20.647
<i>There is both in the heart
of Candy Montgomery.</i>

32:21.105 --> 32:23.441
Damn, that's a good pastor.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.985
<i>Look, I can't discuss the case,
so I won't.</i>

32:25.985 --> 32:28.279
<i>Should you be talking to us at all?</i>

32:28.279 --> 32:31.699
<i>I can talk about the weather.
I can talk about the Dallas Cowboys.</i>

32:31.699 --> 32:34.535
<i>Not like the judge has
a problem with free speech.</i>

32:34.535 --> 32:36.663
<i>After all, he's a judge, right?</i>

32:36.663 --> 32:39.207
<i>- Far as that gag order, I...</i>
- Why are you baiting him?

32:39.207 --> 32:41.876
Fat fuck.
If he holds me in contempt again,

32:41.876 --> 32:44.045
I can argue bias on appeal.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.881
Get a new trial on grounds
of "fat-fuck-ism."

32:48.383 --> 32:50.760
Only thing is we're not losing.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.428
They didn't even nick us today.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.931
Tomorrow will be tougher.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.238
It was pure carnage.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.283
That's why I called in so much backup.

33:15.326 --> 33:18.162
The first thing I noticed
was all the blood.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.790
All dried and congealed.

33:20.790 --> 33:21.999
Caked.

33:21.999 --> 33:23.167
<i>Clotted.</i>

33:23.167 --> 33:24.585
And dried.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.463
Means it had been there a while.

33:27.463 --> 33:29.549
Many, many hours.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.718
It was obvious there was a big struggle.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.011
You have no idea who attacked who first?

33:34.011 --> 33:35.555
I do not.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.099
Mrs. Gore took part in the fight?

33:38.099 --> 33:40.059
She had defensive wounds, so yes.

33:41.644 --> 33:42.687
But whether she held the axe...

33:43.688 --> 33:46.607
You solve all the crimes
you investigate, Chief?

33:46.607 --> 33:48.776
- No, sir.
- Some are carried out

33:48.776 --> 33:51.237
with more care than others.
That fair to say?

33:51.237 --> 33:53.781
- Of course.
- Not a lot of care in this one.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.324
Well.

33:55.908 --> 33:58.745
- There was blood all over.
- A lot of blood.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.955
There were fingerprints
left by the killer.

34:00.955 --> 34:03.332
There was hair left, Candy's fingernail.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.752
- The murder weapon.
- And the body.

34:11.716 --> 34:16.304
If Candy Montgomery planned
to murder Betty Gore,

34:16.304 --> 34:20.516
can you imagine it
being carried out more ineptly?

34:21.309 --> 34:22.685
Probably not.

34:23.227 --> 34:26.063
And if somebody was intent
on killing somebody

34:26.063 --> 34:29.067
and not getting themselves
killed in the process,

34:29.067 --> 34:34.989
would using an axe
be one of the better death instruments

34:34.989 --> 34:37.200
to accomplish that task?

34:37.200 --> 34:39.577
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

34:39.577 --> 34:45.958
A killing done in broad daylight,
with Candy's car parked right out front.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.252
Fair to say if she wanted
to get away with it,

34:48.252 --> 34:50.880
she did a terrible job. Fair to say?

34:50.880 --> 34:54.175
- Fair to say.
- Fair to say.

34:54.175 --> 34:57.011
Clearly, this is no longer
a whodunit but a why-dunit.

34:57.011 --> 34:58.554
Did they wanna get back together?

34:58.554 --> 35:00.014
Did she want him all for herself?

35:00.014 --> 35:02.809
Why did she keep swinging long after
Betty Gore was neutralized?

35:02.809 --> 35:05.269
Hammering her with that big axe.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.688
While the defense keeps
hammering self-defense.

35:07.688 --> 35:10.608
Whatever the defense,
they've got a big, big problem.

35:11.734 --> 35:12.944
Forty whacks.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.948
Self-defense doesn't explain 40 whacks.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.578
There's a reason they're savin'
the pathologist for last.

35:23.371 --> 35:27.166
He's gonna paint a grisly picture,
shock the shit outta the jury.

35:27.166 --> 35:30.127
And it's no coincidence
they're puttin' him up right after lunch.

35:30.127 --> 35:32.630
All it takes is one juror to vomit
and it's

35:34.006 --> 35:35.132
life in prison.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.430
Why aren't they attacking us
more in our theory?

35:42.974 --> 35:43.933
I don't get it.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.352
It's like they're rope-a-dopin'.

35:46.352 --> 35:49.313
It's possible they don't
want to even dignify it.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.440
Forty whacks, like you say,

35:51.440 --> 35:53.484
they're gonna say
self-defense is preposterous.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.653
He seems nice.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.489
The prosecutor.

36:00.366 --> 36:01.284
Excuse me?

36:01.951 --> 36:03.744
He seems like a nice man.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.042
Candy?

36:10.042 --> 36:11.794
Did you take Serax again?

36:15.798 --> 36:17.383
Oh, my fucking God.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.637
I need to hold it together.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.849
Try and get this.

36:24.849 --> 36:28.102
The prosecution is probably
going to rest today.

36:28.728 --> 36:33.065
Which means you could be taking the stage
as soon as tomorrow.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.735
Your head needs to be clear.

36:36.569 --> 36:37.987
And focused.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.281
Otherwise

36:41.157 --> 36:42.742
you're going to jail.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.419
Would you be interested
in having an affair?

36:57.423 --> 36:59.383
<i>It's just somethin'
I've been thinkin' about</i>

36:59.383 --> 37:01.969
and I wanted to say it
so I don't have to think about it anymore.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.681
<i>Bye, Dada.</i>

37:09.894 --> 37:13.314
I have here exhibits marked 22 through 29.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.650
As I pass them for the jury to see,

37:15.650 --> 37:17.860
I'd like you to go through
your external examination

37:17.860 --> 37:20.363
with respect to the injuries you observed.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.115
Of course.
Starting with the right hand,

37:23.115 --> 37:24.659
there was multiple chop-like wounds.

37:25.368 --> 37:28.371
Incision wounds on the right forearm,
running five inches in length.

37:28.371 --> 37:32.166
Chop-like wounds on the left upper arm,
extending into the musculature

37:32.166 --> 37:34.752
from the top of the right
shoulder in the back,

37:34.752 --> 37:37.755
extending five inches down into the back.

37:37.755 --> 37:41.050
The right thigh had two
parallel gaping chop wounds.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.969
The right side of what was her face.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.846
Irregular, gaping, multiple fractures.

37:45.846 --> 37:49.558
The right eye had collapsed into
what would've been the sinuses.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.937
Frontal scalp, right side,
a diagonal gape.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.439
Top of the right ear,
running across the top of the head,

37:55.439 --> 37:57.400
a wound measuring 10 inches in length

37:58.109 --> 38:00.194
produced by seven chop wounds
going through the bone

38:00.194 --> 38:01.529
into the cranial vault.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.240
Top of the head, a C-shaped wound

38:05.032 --> 38:07.535
with the open point of
the C directed downward.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.830
Evidently, that blow was
produced from the top down.

38:10.830 --> 38:14.542
So six cluster wounds on the right side,
which could have caused death.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.253
The crater in the back of the head
that went through to the brain cavity

38:17.253 --> 38:18.963
that could have caused death.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.673
The wounds that ran
across the top of the head

38:20.673 --> 38:22.299
could have caused death.

38:22.299 --> 38:24.927
And also, some of the glancing
blows could have caused death

38:24.927 --> 38:28.597
by producing some hemorrhage
inside the cranial cavity.

38:28.597 --> 38:29.807
And, Doctor,

38:29.807 --> 38:31.350
does the term "defensive wound"

38:31.350 --> 38:34.145
have any significance in
the practice of your profession?

38:34.145 --> 38:36.731
They're defined as wounds
to the extremities.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.232
<i>Arms and legs.</i>

38:38.232 --> 38:39.608
It's usually the back of the hands.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.861
Can be the palm of the hand
or the back of the forearm,

38:41.861 --> 38:43.904
or the back of the arm,
that a victim received

38:43.904 --> 38:45.573
as they tried to ward off a weapon.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.534
Would those wounds
on the arms and the wrists

38:48.534 --> 38:50.703
and the forearms indicate
defensive-type wounds?

38:50.703 --> 38:52.913
- Yes, sir.
- Mrs. Gore was trying to protect herself?

38:52.913 --> 38:54.749
- Yes, sir.
- And, Doctor,

38:54.749 --> 38:59.795
in your testimony, you said,
"On the right side of what was the face."

39:00.504 --> 39:02.757
- What did you mean by that?
- Half of her face.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.053
The right side was nothing
but a mass of tissue and blood.

39:07.053 --> 39:10.556
The eye socket and cheekbone
had been crushed into mush.

39:10.556 --> 39:14.143
So, face, there really was no face.

39:14.143 --> 39:16.437
And, Doctor, are you able to determine

39:16.437 --> 39:18.773
whether wounds are inflicted
pre or post-mortem?

39:21.442 --> 39:23.527
- Yes, sir.
- How are you able to tell?

39:24.070 --> 39:26.072
Well, once you're dead,
you have no more blood pressure.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.949
When the heart stops, there's no bleeding.

39:28.949 --> 39:31.035
The body can leak, but that blood

39:31.035 --> 39:33.788
won't get into the tissue,
causing it to discolor.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.707
Now, if this occurs
while the victim is alive,

39:36.707 --> 39:40.211
this blood will get into the tissue,
essentially like a bruise.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.422
With respect to Betty Gore's autopsy,
can you make any such finding

39:43.422 --> 39:45.674
as to if any of those blows
occurred after death?

39:45.674 --> 39:48.761
There was only one wound, and that was
on the back of the right forearm.

39:49.345 --> 39:53.057
So for all those other wounds
you just described,

39:53.057 --> 39:55.393
- Betty Gore was alive?
- Yes, sir.

39:56.018 --> 39:57.770
As Candy Montgomery swung that axe

39:57.770 --> 40:00.439
over and over and over and over,

40:01.148 --> 40:03.567
for almost all of those 40 swings,

40:03.567 --> 40:04.860
Betty Gore was alive?

40:04.860 --> 40:05.903
Yes, sir.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.822
Is it fair to say she suffered?

40:07.822 --> 40:09.031
What do you think?

40:09.031 --> 40:10.991
- Objection.
- Sustained.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.161
Doctor, according to your medical report,

40:14.161 --> 40:17.748
there were two cranial wounds
which were pointed at the top,

40:17.748 --> 40:19.542
but squared off at the bottom.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.503
- Yes, sir.
- Can you explain that?

40:22.503 --> 40:25.881
The only explanation is that
the axe would've become stuck.

40:26.757 --> 40:29.093
The killer would've had
to wiggle it back and forth

40:29.093 --> 40:32.054
like a woodchopper on top of a split log.

40:32.054 --> 40:35.307
She would have had to wiggle it
to remove it from the bone

40:35.307 --> 40:37.726
to then continue swinging.

40:37.726 --> 40:40.104
How do you know
she resumed swinging again?

40:40.104 --> 40:42.857
Because there was another blow
that went even deeper.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.817
That had to happen right after.

40:45.568 --> 40:48.154
That went directly into the cerebellum.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.408
This killing, Doctor,

40:52.408 --> 40:54.034
have you ever seen
anything like it before?

40:56.245 --> 40:57.663
Never.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.458
I pass the witness.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.128
Mr. Crowder?

41:06.172 --> 41:09.341
Mr. Defense Counsel,
this would be where you get to talk.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.730
You testified that
for most of these blows,

41:22.730 --> 41:24.899
- the victim was alive?
- Yes, sir.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.734
Which means her heart was beating?

41:26.734 --> 41:27.860
Yes, sir.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.612
Does that mean she was conscious?

41:30.738 --> 41:32.156
Not necessarily.

41:32.698 --> 41:34.992
In fact, for

41:35.784 --> 41:39.330
the kinds of blows we're talking about
on the top of the head,

41:40.039 --> 41:43.375
there's a likelihood
that for much of this,

41:44.376 --> 41:46.212
she was unconscious.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.088
True?

41:48.088 --> 41:50.299
Could be true.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.259
Chief Abbott and Dr. Stone testified

41:52.259 --> 41:55.763
that a great struggle took place
between Candy Montgomery and Betty Gore.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.848
Do any of your findings dispute this?

41:57.848 --> 41:59.433
No.

41:59.433 --> 42:03.103
And from your examinations,
are you able to make a determination

42:03.103 --> 42:06.023
- as to who attacked who first?
- No.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.400
Are you able to exclude the possibility

42:08.400 --> 42:11.862
that Candy Montgomery
was attacked by Betty Gore,

42:11.862 --> 42:13.739
and that Candy acted in self-defense?

42:13.739 --> 42:15.366
There is no way of me knowing that.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.243
Which means you can't rule it out.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.036
No.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.251
Nothing further.

42:33.759 --> 42:36.053
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.894
Mr. Crowder,
you may call your first witness.

42:58.993 --> 43:03.122
As the hour is late, Your Honor,
we would ask that we begin in the morning.

43:04.164 --> 43:06.125
The hour's not that late.
Call your first witness.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.003
Approach, Your Honor?

43:16.593 --> 43:20.139
Your Honor, my first witness
is Candy Montgomery

43:20.139 --> 43:21.890
and she's not ready to testify.

43:21.890 --> 43:23.309
Why not?

43:23.309 --> 43:25.602
She took some medication

43:25.602 --> 43:27.146
in order to calm her nerves.

43:27.771 --> 43:29.690
She's gonna need some time.

43:31.358 --> 43:33.402
I'll give you 10 minutes.

43:36.655 --> 43:38.574
She's gonna need more than that.

43:39.325 --> 43:41.744
We should wait and go tomorrow.

43:42.619 --> 43:44.538
Counsel, you got 10 minutes.

43:46.081 --> 43:46.999
Tick.

43:47.958 --> 43:48.876
Tick.

43:49.793 --> 43:50.711
Tick.

43:51.337 --> 43:52.713
Tock.
