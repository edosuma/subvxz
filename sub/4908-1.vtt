05:31.400 --> 05:32.609
Get Charlie.

05:43.745 --> 05:45.414
Dr. Holloway!

05:48.292 --> 05:49.627
Charlie!

05:58.510 --> 05:59.261
What?

06:00.012 --> 06:01.847
Come quick!

06:31.669 --> 06:33.879
- Did you date it?
- Thirty-five thousand...

06:34.046 --> 06:36.089
...years. Maybe older.

06:59.822 --> 07:02.199
You gotta be kidding me.

07:05.078 --> 07:06.829
lt's the same configuration.

07:08.622 --> 07:11.918
l mean, it's gotta predate
the others by millennia.

07:25.723 --> 07:27.975
l think they want us
to come and find them.

07:30.686 --> 07:31.771
Yeah.

08:37.712 --> 08:40.255
What happened to that man?

08:40.422 --> 08:41.506
He died.

08:42.966 --> 08:44.384
Why aren't you helping them?

08:45.678 --> 08:47.388
They don't want my help.

08:47.555 --> 08:49.098
Their God is different than ours.

08:51.433 --> 08:52.852
Why did he die?

08:53.769 --> 08:55.688
Because sooner or later, everyone does.

08:55.855 --> 08:57.106
Like Mummy?

08:59.109 --> 09:00.318
Like Mummy.

09:02.111 --> 09:03.738
Where do they go?

09:05.281 --> 09:07.366
Everyone has their own word.

09:07.658 --> 09:08.784
Heaven.

09:09.451 --> 09:10.285
Paradise.

09:12.121 --> 09:14.415
Whatever it's called,
it's someplace beautiful.

09:14.582 --> 09:16.250
How do you know it's beautiful?

09:18.293 --> 09:19.796
That's what l choose to believe.

09:20.129 --> 09:21.756
What do you believe, Ellie?

09:56.124 --> 09:57.917
Good morning, David.

09:59.001 --> 10:00.461
Transmitting message.

10:03.672 --> 10:05.466
No response.

10:15.226 --> 10:16.685
Whilst this articulation...

10:16.894 --> 10:19.606
...is attested in
the lndo-European descendants...

10:19.773 --> 10:21.649
...as a purely paralinguistic form...

10:21.816 --> 10:24.902
...it is phonemic in the ancestral form
dating back...

10:25.069 --> 10:27.029
...five millennia or more.

10:27.696 --> 10:29.198
Let's attempt Schleicher's fable.

10:29.698 --> 10:30.490
Repeat after me.

10:43.879 --> 10:45.005
Perfect.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.884
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes?

10:48.426 --> 10:50.261
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

10:57.351 --> 10:59.979
You do that once too often.
lt's only flesh and blood!

11:00.730 --> 11:03.232
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

11:03.774 --> 11:05.067
And you're barmy.

11:10.531 --> 11:12.909
- lt damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

11:14.035 --> 11:15.536
Well, what's the trick, then?

11:16.412 --> 11:19.498
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

11:19.999 --> 11:23.252
The trick, William Potter...

11:23.418 --> 11:26.505
...is not minding that it hurts.

11:32.052 --> 11:35.056
The trick, William Potter...

11:35.640 --> 11:39.144
...is not minding that it hurts.

11:52.782 --> 11:54.408
Attention:

11:54.658 --> 11:56.035
Destination threshold.

11:56.452 --> 11:57.536
Attention:

11:57.703 --> 11:59.706
Destination threshold.

12:00.164 --> 12:02.625
Attention: Destination threshold.

13:04.979 --> 13:06.022
Robe.

13:17.491 --> 13:18.784
How long?

13:19.077 --> 13:21.329
Two years, four months, 18 days...

13:21.496 --> 13:22.705
...36 hours, 15 minutes.

13:23.039 --> 13:24.290
Any casualties?

13:24.832 --> 13:25.959
Casualties, ma'am?

13:26.126 --> 13:27.168
Has anyone died?

13:27.752 --> 13:29.671
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.

13:31.756 --> 13:33.340
Well, then wake them up.

13:44.601 --> 13:46.521
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.

13:47.730 --> 13:49.315
My name is David.

13:50.733 --> 13:53.069
Your mind and body
are in a state of shock...

13:53.236 --> 13:55.321
...as a result of the stasis.

13:55.572 --> 13:57.448
lt's all right. Perfectly normal.

13:57.657 --> 13:58.407
Ellie.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.076
We're here, baby.

14:05.414 --> 14:06.249
There, there.

14:08.084 --> 14:10.294
Drink plenty of water.
Drink plenty of fluids.

14:11.837 --> 14:13.256
Hydration aids muscle mass.

14:18.427 --> 14:21.514
All crew, consume shakes
with high caloric content.

14:27.770 --> 14:29.938
What the hell is that?

14:32.024 --> 14:32.900
lt's Christmas.

14:33.317 --> 14:34.443
We need the holidays...

14:34.610 --> 14:36.153
...to show time is still moving.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.238
Mission briefing...

14:37.404 --> 14:38.947
...is about to start, captain.

14:39.449 --> 14:41.034
Might wanna make your way down.

14:41.284 --> 14:43.619
Well, l haven't had any breakfast yet.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.496
ls this seat taken?

14:46.665 --> 14:49.250
Hi, l'm Millburn, Biology. Nice to meet you.

14:51.461 --> 14:52.211
Okay.

14:52.378 --> 14:55.881
Look, no offense, but...

14:56.423 --> 14:58.467
...l've been asleep two years.

14:59.135 --> 15:01.679
l ain't here to be your friend.

15:02.013 --> 15:03.305
l'm here to make money.

15:04.431 --> 15:05.766
You got that?

15:08.311 --> 15:09.645
Okay.

15:09.979 --> 15:12.691
l bet a hundred credits
it's a terraforming survey.

15:12.858 --> 15:14.818
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us.

15:14.984 --> 15:17.236
lt's a corporate run,
they're not telling us shit.

15:17.403 --> 15:18.237
Come on.

15:18.404 --> 15:20.323
- A hundred.
- All right, you're on.

15:24.993 --> 15:26.412
You look nervous, El.

15:26.996 --> 15:29.832
- l'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
- l know you will.

15:29.999 --> 15:30.916
Good morning.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.212
For those of you l hired personally...

15:35.213 --> 15:37.340
...it's nice to see you again.

15:38.132 --> 15:42.011
For the rest of you, l am Meredith Vickers.
lt's my job to make sure you do yours.

15:42.512 --> 15:45.098
Okay, then. On with the show.

15:50.686 --> 15:52.437
Weyland Corporation.

15:52.689 --> 15:54.690
Building better worlds.

15:55.983 --> 15:57.568
Hello, friends.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.281
My name is Peter Weyland.

16:03.324 --> 16:05.117
l am your employer.

16:05.368 --> 16:10.415
l am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...

16:11.249 --> 16:13.376
...you have reached your destination.

16:14.043 --> 16:16.045
And l am long dead.

16:16.670 --> 16:18.630
May l rest in peace.

16:19.841 --> 16:23.010
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.

16:23.177 --> 16:26.222
And he is the closest thing to a son
l will ever have.

16:26.514 --> 16:29.267
Unfortunately, he is not human.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.810
He will never grow old...

16:31.060 --> 16:32.938
...and he will never die.

16:33.897 --> 16:37.066
And yet he is unable to appreciate
these remarkable gifts...

16:37.233 --> 16:41.570
...for that would require the one thing
that David will never have.

16:41.779 --> 16:42.905
A soul.

16:43.906 --> 16:45.616
l have spent my entire...

16:45.866 --> 16:48.286
...lifetime contemplating the questions:

16:48.578 --> 16:50.079
Where do we come from?

16:50.413 --> 16:51.914
What is our purpose?

16:52.164 --> 16:53.583
What happens when we die?

16:54.292 --> 16:58.212
And l have found two people who convinced
me they're on the verge of answering them.

16:58.921 --> 17:01.883
Drs. Holloway and Shaw,
if you would please stand.

17:04.218 --> 17:06.262
As far as you're concerned,
they're in charge.

17:07.387 --> 17:11.974
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give
mankind equal footing with the gods...

17:12.142 --> 17:15.730
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.

17:16.605 --> 17:21.444
Well, my friends,
the time has finally come for his return.

17:22.069 --> 17:23.029
Doctors, please.

17:27.367 --> 17:28.285
The floor is yours.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.794
Okay, wow.

17:38.961 --> 17:40.338
All right.

17:40.505 --> 17:42.298
l never had to follow a ghost before.

17:42.673 --> 17:44.717
Okay, let me show you why you guys...

17:44.925 --> 17:46.010
...are here.

17:53.477 --> 17:58.648
These are images of archeological digs
from all over the Earth.

17:58.815 --> 17:59.649
That's...

17:59.816 --> 18:03.194
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.

18:03.444 --> 18:06.239
That's Hawaiian there at the end,
then Mesopotamian.

18:06.489 --> 18:09.492
Now, this one here
is our most recent discovery.

18:09.659 --> 18:13.663
lt's a 35,000-year-old cave painting
from the lsle of Skye in Scotland.

18:13.955 --> 18:18.167
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.

18:18.334 --> 18:21.421
They shared no contact with one another,
and yet....

18:25.258 --> 18:26.342
The same pictogram...

18:26.509 --> 18:30.137
...showing men worshipping giant beings,
pointing to the stars...

18:30.346 --> 18:33.308
...was discovered
at every last one of them.

18:33.850 --> 18:36.477
And the only galactic system
that matched...

18:37.520 --> 18:40.065
...was so far from Earth
that there's no way...

18:40.231 --> 18:44.360
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations
could have possibly known about it.

18:44.527 --> 18:46.028
But itjust so happens...

18:47.739 --> 18:49.074
...that that system...

18:50.533 --> 18:51.659
...has a sun...

18:52.702 --> 18:54.120
...a lot like ours.

18:55.204 --> 18:59.500
And, based on our long-range scans,
there seemed to be a planet.

19:00.918 --> 19:03.170
Just one planet with a moon...

19:03.379 --> 19:05.297
...capable of sustaining life.

19:06.716 --> 19:08.801
And we arrived there this morning.

19:11.053 --> 19:15.892
So you're saying we're here because of a map
you two kids found in a cave. ls that right?

19:17.185 --> 19:18.436
- No.
- Yeah.

19:20.730 --> 19:23.190
No. Not a map, an invitation.

19:23.357 --> 19:24.733
From who?

19:26.235 --> 19:27.987
We call them Engineers.

19:28.905 --> 19:30.406
Engineers?

19:30.573 --> 19:31.407
Do you mind...

19:32.450 --> 19:34.244
...telling us what they engineered?

19:36.246 --> 19:37.914
They engineered us.

19:40.667 --> 19:41.501
Bullshit.

19:43.712 --> 19:45.588
Okay, so do you...

19:45.755 --> 19:47.423
...have anything to back that up?

19:48.132 --> 19:49.925
Look, if you're willing to discount...

19:50.134 --> 19:51.927
...centuries of Darwinism, that's....

19:55.139 --> 19:56.057
But how do you know?

19:57.600 --> 19:58.934
l don't.

19:59.435 --> 20:01.563
But it's what l choose to believe.

20:29.465 --> 20:30.508
Doctors.

20:31.592 --> 20:35.639
Miss Vickers would like to have
a quick word before the adventure begins.

20:43.145 --> 20:44.104
Wow, nice place.

20:44.271 --> 20:48.401
lt's actually a separate module
with its own self-contained life support.

20:48.860 --> 20:50.528
Air, food.

20:50.820 --> 20:54.407
Anything Miss Vickers would need
to survive a hostile environment.

20:54.658 --> 20:56.618
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.

20:56.784 --> 20:57.827
Yes.

20:57.994 --> 20:58.661
l do.

20:58.828 --> 21:01.081
l like to minimize risk.

21:01.665 --> 21:05.251
David, why don't you make
the doctors a drink?

21:05.835 --> 21:08.588
l'll take a vodka. Up.

21:09.005 --> 21:10.423
Charlie, look.

21:10.631 --> 21:12.966
lt's a Pauling Med-Pod.

21:13.259 --> 21:15.637
They only made a dozen of these.

21:15.803 --> 21:16.637
Miss Shaw.

21:16.804 --> 21:19.265
Please verbally state
the nature of your injury.

21:19.723 --> 21:21.351
Please don't touch that.

21:21.518 --> 21:23.478
lt's a very expensive piece of machinery.

21:24.020 --> 21:26.523
lt does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?

21:28.358 --> 21:30.985
There might be some confusion
about our relationship.

21:32.070 --> 21:34.864
Weyland found you impressive enough
to fund this mission.

21:35.072 --> 21:37.533
But l'm fairly certain your Engineers
are scribblings...

21:37.700 --> 21:39.911
...of savages living in dirty little caves.

21:41.162 --> 21:44.207
But let's say l'm wrong,
and you do find these beings down there...

21:45.374 --> 21:47.502
...you won't engage them...

21:47.794 --> 21:49.295
...you won't talk to them.

21:49.546 --> 21:52.173
You will do nothing
but report back to me.

21:55.719 --> 21:57.971
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...

21:58.138 --> 21:59.764
...you're not telling us about?

22:00.348 --> 22:01.015
My company...

22:01.182 --> 22:03.726
...paid a trillion dollars to find this place
and bring you.

22:03.893 --> 22:06.688
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...

22:06.855 --> 22:09.732
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.

22:11.067 --> 22:12.318
But you didn't.

22:12.735 --> 22:14.321
And that makes you an employee.

22:15.780 --> 22:17.782
But if we can't make contact...

22:17.949 --> 22:20.452
...why did you even bring us here?

22:21.244 --> 22:23.997
Weyland was a superstitious man.

22:24.706 --> 22:27.083
He wanted a true believer onboard.

22:29.752 --> 22:30.961
Cheers.

22:34.257 --> 22:35.425
So no response?

22:36.092 --> 22:37.176
l'm sorry, no.

22:37.343 --> 22:39.261
Maybe they didn't understand it.

22:40.639 --> 22:42.682
How are your lessons going, David?

22:43.892 --> 22:47.437
l spent two years deconstructing
dozens of ancient languages...

22:48.063 --> 22:49.689
...to their roots. l'm confident...

22:49.856 --> 22:51.358
...l can communicate with them...

22:51.608 --> 22:53.776
...provided your thesis is correct.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.196
"Provided it's correct." That's good.

22:57.363 --> 23:00.283
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.

23:03.369 --> 23:05.079
What are you smiling about?

23:05.246 --> 23:07.124
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.

23:07.290 --> 23:08.792
- Roger that.
- Yes, captain.

23:09.167 --> 23:10.627
Descent trajectory mapped.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.337
How we doing?

23:12.503 --> 23:13.589
Great.

23:14.840 --> 23:15.632
All right, boss.

23:16.299 --> 23:17.092
All personnel...

23:17.259 --> 23:18.426
...this is the captain.

23:18.593 --> 23:20.011
Brace for entry.

23:20.178 --> 23:21.429
Yes, captain.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.472
That means you too, Vickers.

23:23.639 --> 23:24.724
All systems...

23:24.974 --> 23:25.891
...online.

23:33.274 --> 23:34.526
What is the atmosphere?

23:34.693 --> 23:35.902
Atmosphere is...

23:36.069 --> 23:37.320
...71 percent nitrogen...

23:37.487 --> 23:38.655
...21 percent oxygen...

23:38.821 --> 23:39.947
...traces of argon gas.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.200
Whoa, now, that's weather.

23:42.409 --> 23:43.493
Just like home.

23:43.660 --> 23:45.495
lf you're breathing
through an exhaust pipe.

23:45.995 --> 23:47.955
CO2 is over 3 percent.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.166
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.

23:53.670 --> 23:54.796
Peak portside.

23:55.046 --> 23:56.798
Whoa, 52,000!

23:57.048 --> 23:59.175
lt makes Everest
look like a baby brother.

23:59.467 --> 24:01.678
All right, take us around.

24:01.845 --> 24:03.555
We'll use that as our point of entry.

24:06.015 --> 24:08.268
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...

24:08.435 --> 24:09.853
...a couple of hard spots.

24:10.020 --> 24:11.521
Could be metal.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.544
No radio, no heat source.

24:34.628 --> 24:35.712
Nobody's home.

24:36.963 --> 24:38.548
There is nothing in the desert...

24:39.382 --> 24:41.050
...and no man needs nothing.

24:41.426 --> 24:42.635
What was that?

24:43.886 --> 24:45.971
Just something from a film l like.

24:50.310 --> 24:51.727
Let's go through that gateway.

24:52.019 --> 24:54.064
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.

24:58.735 --> 25:01.488
Going through. Nice and slow.

25:07.493 --> 25:08.578
Keep it steady, boys.

25:08.745 --> 25:09.412
There.

25:09.912 --> 25:11.580
No, what are you doing?

25:11.747 --> 25:14.626
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?

25:15.960 --> 25:17.879
Right there. God does not build in...

25:18.046 --> 25:21.174
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...

25:21.341 --> 25:22.842
...could you put us down there?

25:23.051 --> 25:25.261
l wouldn't be any good
if l couldn't do that.

25:25.428 --> 25:28.765
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.

25:33.645 --> 25:36.856
- One mile, port bow.
- One mile, port bow.

25:37.148 --> 25:38.774
Engage landing sequence.

25:38.941 --> 25:40.067
Switch to manual.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.403
- Commence landing.
- Easy.

25:41.569 --> 25:43.613
- Roger that.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.

25:46.407 --> 25:47.784
Bringing her down in five.

25:47.951 --> 25:49.744
- Preparing RCS thrusters.
- Four.

25:53.414 --> 25:55.125
Two. Easy does it.

26:12.767 --> 26:15.479
Generator systems are inactive.

26:15.645 --> 26:17.981
Temperature is at 2.724 K.

26:29.867 --> 26:30.910
Captain, would you...

26:31.077 --> 26:33.079
...tell the survey team to suit up...

26:33.245 --> 26:34.664
...and meet us in the airlock.

26:35.206 --> 26:37.000
Only six hours left of daylight.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.835
- Leave it till morning.
- No, no, no.

26:39.544 --> 26:41.004
lt's Christmas, captain...

26:41.171 --> 26:43.048
...and l want to open my presents.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.174
You, boy.

26:44.341 --> 26:45.675
You're coming with us.

26:46.009 --> 26:47.469
l'd be delighted.

26:53.016 --> 26:55.643
Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.

26:57.854 --> 26:59.438
Hey, Jackson...

26:59.814 --> 27:01.066
...what's that for?

27:01.858 --> 27:02.817
Expedition security.

27:03.026 --> 27:05.611
My job is to make sure
everybody is nice and safe.

27:07.197 --> 27:10.158
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.

27:10.325 --> 27:11.368
All right, then.

27:11.743 --> 27:13.119
Good luck with that.

27:16.081 --> 27:17.874
David, why are you wearing a suit, man?

27:19.376 --> 27:20.502
l beg your pardon?

27:20.668 --> 27:22.337
You don't breathe, remember?

27:22.503 --> 27:24.630
So why wear a suit?

27:25.256 --> 27:27.384
l was designed like this...

27:27.676 --> 27:31.763
...because you people are more comfortable
interacting with your own kind.

27:32.889 --> 27:36.226
lf l didn't wear the suit,
it would defeat the purpose.

27:37.185 --> 27:39.145
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?

27:39.729 --> 27:41.190
Not too close, l hope.

27:51.032 --> 27:53.576
Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.

27:58.956 --> 28:00.667
Ramp will open in five...

28:00.834 --> 28:04.879
...four, three, two, one.

28:22.314 --> 28:23.606
Hey.

28:24.315 --> 28:26.734
This is just one small step for mankind.

28:27.611 --> 28:28.612
Seriously?

28:34.785 --> 28:36.578
You ready to do this? l know you are.

28:47.254 --> 28:48.215
Hey, Fifield.

28:48.381 --> 28:49.549
l want a spectrograph on this.

28:49.758 --> 28:51.968
l want to know if it's natural
or if somebody put it there.

28:52.135 --> 28:54.846
l can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what l can...

28:54.972 --> 28:57.098
...tell you is, it's hollow.

29:21.248 --> 29:25.001
Prometheus, are you seeing this?

29:25.335 --> 29:26.503
Affirmative.

29:26.836 --> 29:28.130
We see it.

29:35.345 --> 29:36.012
Okay, ready?

29:36.179 --> 29:37.680
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

30:11.089 --> 30:13.257
- After you.
- After you.

30:13.383 --> 30:14.343
Okay.

30:14.510 --> 30:15.552
Careful.

30:16.219 --> 30:18.179
Prometheus, we're going in.

30:18.430 --> 30:19.556
Copy that.

30:53.089 --> 30:53.924
What's back here?

30:54.090 --> 30:56.217
Some kind of a corridor?

30:57.135 --> 30:59.720
Mr. Fifield,
let's get a grid of the structure.

30:59.887 --> 31:01.264
l want the whole interior.

31:02.265 --> 31:04.559
lf there's anything in here
worth looking at...

31:04.726 --> 31:05.977
...these pups'll find them.

31:06.644 --> 31:07.604
"Pups"?

31:07.771 --> 31:10.107
Yeah, pups. My pups.

31:24.912 --> 31:27.666
Prometheus, we are now mapping.

31:31.961 --> 31:33.046
Copy that.

31:45.392 --> 31:46.393
Well, l'll be damned.

32:01.116 --> 32:02.367
Fifield, you got a read?

32:02.534 --> 32:03.660
Yeah.

32:04.411 --> 32:07.372
Pups are saying this way.

32:25.932 --> 32:27.350
Look at this.

32:34.692 --> 32:36.318
Oh, Charlie.

32:40.322 --> 32:41.364
Jesus.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.533
The sunlight is heating the water.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.785
Check out the humidity.

32:45.993 --> 32:47.578
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.

32:48.121 --> 32:49.164
Outside...

32:49.331 --> 32:51.374
...it's completely toxic, and in here...

32:51.541 --> 32:53.626
...there's nothing. lt's breathable.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.297
What are you doing?

32:57.464 --> 32:59.716
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't be a skeptic.

33:00.258 --> 33:02.344
There's something
generating an atmosphere.

33:02.720 --> 33:03.971
David?

33:04.138 --> 33:06.264
- Dr. Holloway is correct.
- Cleaner than Earth...

33:06.473 --> 33:07.641
...actually.

33:07.808 --> 33:08.725
They were terraforming.

33:09.059 --> 33:10.518
Please don't do--

33:10.685 --> 33:12.520
l'm not wearing this thing anymore.

33:13.020 --> 33:14.272
Wish me luck, baby.

33:14.523 --> 33:17.067
Do you copy?
Do not remove your headgear.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.585
You crazy bastard.

33:40.256 --> 33:41.508
Connect our suit cameras...

33:41.675 --> 33:45.929
...if you want to continue watching this
freak show. We are taking our helmets off.

33:47.055 --> 33:48.766
Copy that. Switching feeds.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.936
Well, come on. Pay up.

33:53.645 --> 33:56.357
- Pay what?
- What do you mean, "Pay what"?

33:56.523 --> 34:00.027
Something is manufacturing
breathable air down there. That, mate...

34:00.193 --> 34:02.946
- ...is terraforming.
- No, no. The bet was why we came here.

34:03.113 --> 34:05.990
lf you said a dead old man wanted
to talk to Martians, l'd pay.

34:06.157 --> 34:07.533
Come on, a hundred credits.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.704
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that?

34:12.789 --> 34:14.958
lt's minus 12 in here.

34:15.125 --> 34:17.252
So why is this water not frozen?

34:17.418 --> 34:18.837
Maybe it ain't water.

34:19.588 --> 34:21.047
Maybe it's Martian piss.

34:23.092 --> 34:26.136
That's your scientific theory?

34:26.303 --> 34:28.221
ls it? Mr. Biology?

34:32.433 --> 34:34.310
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.

34:35.437 --> 34:37.147
Some kind of sediment, perhaps.

34:57.167 --> 34:58.293
lmpressive.

35:18.022 --> 35:18.772
What was that?

35:19.690 --> 35:20.899
David?

35:21.817 --> 35:22.442
David?

35:23.902 --> 35:25.111
What is that?

35:27.113 --> 35:28.031
David?

35:36.707 --> 35:38.000
Ellie!

35:42.880 --> 35:43.714
What was that?

35:44.506 --> 35:46.383
l'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.

35:46.550 --> 35:48.844
- Come on, El. Let's go.
- Whose idea was that?

35:49.261 --> 35:50.178
Keep up!

35:52.639 --> 35:53.306
Come on!

36:01.272 --> 36:02.608
Where did he go?

36:07.904 --> 36:09.490
Wait, wait, wait.

36:14.453 --> 36:17.539
There it is. There it is. There it is.

36:18.540 --> 36:21.042
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.

36:21.209 --> 36:22.753
What do you mean "them"?

36:24.046 --> 36:25.463
lt is them, Ellie.

36:26.256 --> 36:27.841
lt looks like a door...

36:28.217 --> 36:32.179
...and he's been decapitated by it.

36:33.430 --> 36:34.932
Son of a bitch.

36:36.684 --> 36:38.060
They were right.

36:41.563 --> 36:43.648
What did you want them to be? Wrong?

36:47.443 --> 36:48.570
David...

36:49.279 --> 36:50.947
...please tell me you can read that.

36:51.615 --> 36:52.866
Perhaps.

36:55.119 --> 36:56.787
No, l'm out of here.

36:58.789 --> 37:00.624
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?

37:02.293 --> 37:03.377
What?

37:05.129 --> 37:07.798
Look, l'm just a geologist.

37:07.965 --> 37:10.133
l like rocks. l love rocks!

37:10.592 --> 37:13.052
Now it's clear
you two don't give a shit about rocks.

37:13.219 --> 37:15.764
But what you do seem to care about
is gigantic dead...

37:15.973 --> 37:16.682
...bodies.

37:16.890 --> 37:19.851
As l don't really have anything
to contribute in the gigantic...

37:20.060 --> 37:21.478
...dead body arena...

37:23.022 --> 37:26.525
...l want to go back to the ship,
if you don't mind.

37:29.987 --> 37:30.738
Anyone wanna...

37:30.905 --> 37:33.031
...join me, hey? You staying?

37:34.741 --> 37:35.784
No, ship's good.

37:35.951 --> 37:38.161
Yeah. Ship very good.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.166
Congratulations on meeting your maker.

37:42.958 --> 37:44.126
Thank you.

37:44.835 --> 37:45.585
Pull yourself...

37:45.752 --> 37:46.670
...together, man.

37:50.132 --> 37:53.093
And l thought you were the crazy one.

38:00.976 --> 38:02.769
Do you have the carbon reader?

38:05.188 --> 38:06.481
Thank you.

38:12.696 --> 38:13.822
How long's it been dead?

38:16.617 --> 38:17.701
Two thousand years...

38:17.868 --> 38:19.036
...give or take.

38:22.623 --> 38:24.208
What are you doing, David?

38:25.167 --> 38:26.877
l'm attempting to open the door.

38:27.044 --> 38:29.337
Wait. We don't know
what's on the other side.

38:31.715 --> 38:33.133
Oops. Sorry.

38:37.804 --> 38:40.140
Look, Ford. lt's the head.

38:50.651 --> 38:52.903
An amazing state of preservation.

38:53.195 --> 38:54.947
- We'll take it in.
- Yeah.

38:59.034 --> 39:00.577
Remarkably human.

39:18.262 --> 39:19.930
Beautiful painting.

39:21.056 --> 39:22.349
lt's a mural.

39:34.944 --> 39:35.613
Stop.

39:35.780 --> 39:36.947
Stop. Don't touch it.

39:37.114 --> 39:38.198
Sorry.

39:39.366 --> 39:41.326
Please, don't touch anything.

39:42.286 --> 39:42.954
Sweating.

40:21.909 --> 40:23.077
Organic.

40:29.667 --> 40:30.668
Oh, no.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.670
Charlie, the murals are changing.

40:33.837 --> 40:36.215
l think we've affected the atmosphere
in the room.

40:36.465 --> 40:38.300
Charlie, do you copy?

40:39.343 --> 40:40.177
Oh, the head!

40:40.469 --> 40:42.554
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!

40:54.191 --> 40:55.693
- Boss.
- What you got?

40:56.694 --> 40:58.612
We got an incoming storm front.

40:58.779 --> 40:59.947
Silica...

41:00.113 --> 41:02.116
...and lots of static. This is not good.

41:02.283 --> 41:03.034
l see it.

41:07.121 --> 41:07.955
Ground crew...

41:08.163 --> 41:09.164
...this is Janek.

41:09.331 --> 41:11.166
l need you to hustle back right now.

41:11.458 --> 41:12.959
Ground crew, do you copy me?

41:13.168 --> 41:14.461
l got 200-kilometer...

41:14.627 --> 41:16.213
...winds of airborne silica...

41:16.338 --> 41:17.840
...and enough static to fry your suit.

41:18.006 --> 41:19.508
Copy that, sir.

41:19.674 --> 41:20.634
We need more time.

41:21.343 --> 41:22.678
l'll be closing the outer...

41:22.845 --> 41:24.054
...doors in 15 minutes.

41:24.221 --> 41:26.390
l sincerely hope you can make it.

41:29.143 --> 41:31.062
Charlie! David!

41:31.645 --> 41:32.730
We must leave now.

41:34.898 --> 41:36.566
This is just another tomb.

41:41.070 --> 41:42.281
David!

41:45.158 --> 41:47.035
- On three.
- Two, three, up.

41:47.202 --> 41:48.578
Let's go!

41:49.330 --> 41:51.081
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.

41:54.167 --> 41:56.879
David, we are leaving!

42:06.429 --> 42:07.263
Come on!

42:07.430 --> 42:09.141
Damn it, they've already taken off.

42:09.308 --> 42:10.267
Come on, let's go.

42:11.935 --> 42:15.063
Prometheus to ground crew.
You're running out of time.

42:15.272 --> 42:17.274
All right, come on. Let's go.

42:32.581 --> 42:33.957
Go faster!

42:57.814 --> 42:58.940
Charlie! The head!

42:59.941 --> 43:00.483
Ellie, no!

43:00.650 --> 43:01.317
What are you doing?

43:10.119 --> 43:10.911
Hatch closure...

43:11.078 --> 43:12.079
- ...in five seconds.
- Shit.

43:13.372 --> 43:14.122
Damn it, hold on!

43:16.501 --> 43:17.251
Goddamn it.

43:17.460 --> 43:18.586
Door closing.

43:20.796 --> 43:21.880
Ellie, don't move!

43:27.093 --> 43:27.761
Charlie!

43:31.306 --> 43:32.349
Grab my hand!

43:43.528 --> 43:43.945
No!

43:45.071 --> 43:45.988
No, Ellie!

43:46.155 --> 43:46.947
Ellie!

44:25.235 --> 44:26.236
Got it.

44:34.203 --> 44:36.039
So, what was that, Ellie?

44:36.331 --> 44:38.708
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...

44:38.916 --> 44:40.376
...almost killing yourself!

44:40.543 --> 44:41.543
Are you all right?

44:41.961 --> 44:43.295
Yes.

44:43.587 --> 44:44.755
Thank you, David.

44:45.255 --> 44:46.756
My pleasure.

44:47.090 --> 44:48.883
Doctors, it's real good to have...

44:49.093 --> 44:51.387
...you back,
but where's Millburn and Fifield?

44:51.553 --> 44:53.263
Aren't they back yet?

44:54.765 --> 44:56.267
- Get them up for me.
- All right.

44:59.228 --> 45:00.938
We've been here before, Fifield.

45:01.105 --> 45:03.775
l don't know. lt all looks the same to me.

45:04.734 --> 45:06.777
Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.

45:07.403 --> 45:10.114
Between the static electricity
and the wind speed...

45:10.280 --> 45:12.574
...well, there ain't no safe way
to come get you.

45:13.200 --> 45:13.950
What?

45:14.117 --> 45:17.621
The temperature is dropping rapidly,
so get your helmets on and stay warm...

45:18.288 --> 45:20.290
...until the storm passes.

45:20.457 --> 45:21.291
Captain...

45:21.625 --> 45:24.795
...can you get a message to the scientist
and his zealot girlfriend?

45:25.963 --> 45:27.006
You got a pen nearby?

45:27.172 --> 45:29.091
No. No, l think we got it.

45:29.759 --> 45:31.594
Tell them l said... themselves.

45:32.845 --> 45:33.637
Copy?

45:33.846 --> 45:36.056
Copy that.
All right, boys, keep your head down...

45:36.223 --> 45:38.517
...and we'll come get you in the morning.

45:40.268 --> 45:41.269
Well, which way now?

45:41.436 --> 45:42.228
All right.

45:42.395 --> 45:44.440
Well, which way, huh?

45:58.412 --> 46:00.414
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.

46:00.831 --> 46:01.832
David.

46:05.127 --> 46:07.003
So are they all dead?

46:08.421 --> 46:10.341
What? Who?

46:10.966 --> 46:12.176
Your Engineers.

46:12.676 --> 46:14.344
Are they all dead or aren't they?

46:14.553 --> 46:16.013
l don't know.

46:16.180 --> 46:17.473
We just got here.

46:17.932 --> 46:18.641
Scan.

46:21.351 --> 46:22.812
Do you care if they're dead?

46:23.730 --> 46:25.148
Weyland cared.

46:25.439 --> 46:27.024
Dr. Shaw.

46:27.316 --> 46:28.359
Have a look at this.

46:33.030 --> 46:34.990
- That's not an exoskeleton.
- No.

46:35.156 --> 46:37.159
l think it's a helmet.

46:37.451 --> 46:39.703
- Let's see if we can lift it up.
- We should...

46:39.870 --> 46:41.288
...be able to prize this open.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.375
lt's too heavy for us. David?

46:51.507 --> 46:52.717
Careful.

46:53.009 --> 46:54.718
Like so.

47:08.565 --> 47:10.359
What is that on its head?

47:10.818 --> 47:12.945
lt looks like new cells.

47:13.862 --> 47:15.864
- ln a state of....
- Change.

47:16.032 --> 47:16.741
Yes.

47:17.075 --> 47:18.409
Changing into what?

47:18.826 --> 47:21.078
Can you run a stem line
into the locus coeruleus?

47:21.412 --> 47:24.665
l think we can trick the nervous system
into thinking it's still alive.

47:26.291 --> 47:27.542
- Thirty amps.
- Okay.

47:28.126 --> 47:29.002
No more.

47:30.546 --> 47:32.589
Let me make an incision.

47:33.340 --> 47:34.091
Okay.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.098
Go up, 40.

47:43.142 --> 47:44.227
Okay, 40 up.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.938
Did you see that?

47:48.564 --> 47:50.357
- Yes.
- Yep. See?

47:50.524 --> 47:52.109
Go up another 10.

47:52.442 --> 47:53.902
Okay, up 10.

47:56.280 --> 47:57.323
Maybe it's a little...

47:57.531 --> 47:59.325
- ...too much. Go down 10.
- Okay.

47:59.533 --> 48:00.951
- Down 10.
- Down another 20.

48:01.493 --> 48:02.285
Okay, l'm trying.

48:03.287 --> 48:04.914
l'm trying, it's not going down.

48:05.081 --> 48:06.332
Full down. Ford...

48:06.582 --> 48:07.458
...stop it.

48:07.625 --> 48:08.876
Oh, God.

48:09.126 --> 48:11.212
David, contain it! Now!

48:11.379 --> 48:12.588
Contain it? Turn it off!

48:12.964 --> 48:14.382
Oh, God. The smell!

48:15.257 --> 48:16.300
Oh, God, look at that.

48:16.467 --> 48:17.468
Look at that.

48:17.634 --> 48:18.802
lt's getting worse.

48:34.485 --> 48:36.279
Mortal, after all.

48:43.661 --> 48:44.995
Ford, take a sample.

48:46.163 --> 48:47.789
Let's have a look.

48:52.378 --> 48:54.838
No, sir, l will take care of it.

48:55.172 --> 48:57.550
Yes, sir, understood. l'm sorry.

48:58.551 --> 49:01.178
Fortunately, slightly premature.

49:05.266 --> 49:06.684
Of course, sir.

49:35.129 --> 49:36.255
Miss Vickers.

49:40.676 --> 49:42.010
What did he say, David?

49:42.344 --> 49:44.680
l don't think he'd want me to tell you.

49:52.438 --> 49:54.732
What did he say?

49:54.899 --> 49:55.649
l'm sorry...

49:55.816 --> 49:56.985
...that's confidential.

49:57.152 --> 49:59.070
So help me God...

49:59.404 --> 50:03.407
...l will find the cord that makes you run
and l will cut it.

50:04.199 --> 50:06.285
What did he say?

50:07.786 --> 50:09.079
He said:

50:10.081 --> 50:12.583
"Try harder."

50:14.251 --> 50:16.546
Cup of tea, ma'am?

50:33.145 --> 50:34.229
Genetic view.

50:34.396 --> 50:35.272
Okay.

50:35.439 --> 50:37.858
Let's have a look at its DNA.

50:47.201 --> 50:48.285
lsolate the strand.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.080
Okay.

50:51.664 --> 50:53.791
Compare it to the gene sample?

50:54.125 --> 50:55.251
Yeah.

50:55.584 --> 50:56.627
Overlay.

50:56.961 --> 50:58.295
Processing.

51:00.255 --> 51:01.590
Processing.

51:03.384 --> 51:05.761
DNA match.

51:07.054 --> 51:08.639
Oh, my God.

51:28.825 --> 51:30.119
lt's us.

51:30.494 --> 51:31.662
lt's everything.

51:35.582 --> 51:37.585
What killed them?

51:55.143 --> 51:56.019
Big things...

51:56.186 --> 51:58.189
...have small beginnings.

52:07.281 --> 52:09.033
Am l interrupting?

52:09.533 --> 52:11.828
l thought you might be running low.

52:15.873 --> 52:18.792
- Pour yourself a glass, pal.
- Thank you, but l'm afraid...

52:18.959 --> 52:20.377
...it would be wasted on me.

52:20.961 --> 52:23.214
Right, l almost forgot you're not a real boy.

52:27.259 --> 52:29.720
l'm very sorry that your Engineers
are all gone.

52:34.558 --> 52:37.020
You think we wasted our time
coming here, don't you?

52:38.438 --> 52:43.067
Your question depends on me understanding
what you hoped to achieve by coming here.

52:43.234 --> 52:46.070
What we hoped to achieve
was to meet our makers.

52:46.236 --> 52:47.154
To get answers.

52:47.779 --> 52:49.614
Why they even...

52:49.740 --> 52:51.242
...made us in the first place.

52:53.827 --> 52:56.205
Why do you think your people made me?

52:57.498 --> 52:58.666
Because we could.

53:01.585 --> 53:03.963
Can you imagine how disappointing
it would be...

53:04.130 --> 53:06.257
...to hear the same thing
from your creator?

53:11.595 --> 53:12.388
l guess it's...

53:12.554 --> 53:14.264
...good you can't be disappointed.

53:14.848 --> 53:16.349
Yes. lt's wonderful...

53:17.018 --> 53:17.685
...actually.

53:17.852 --> 53:19.603
May l ask you something?

53:20.938 --> 53:21.855
Please do.

53:22.022 --> 53:23.273
How far would you go...

53:24.025 --> 53:26.652
...to get what you came all this way for?

53:26.819 --> 53:28.195
Your answers.

53:29.446 --> 53:30.699
What are you willing to do?

53:31.116 --> 53:32.575
Anything and everything.

53:33.868 --> 53:36.120
That's worth drinking to, l'd imagine.

53:47.548 --> 53:49.425
Here's mud in your eye, pal.

53:53.846 --> 53:55.222
Good health.

54:00.103 --> 54:01.354
lt's those things.

54:05.024 --> 54:06.150
Are they real?

54:08.026 --> 54:09.111
Of course they're real.

54:10.238 --> 54:11.948
Jesus Christ. l mean....

54:13.240 --> 54:14.408
Look at the pile.

54:15.075 --> 54:16.953
Look how high up they are.

54:17.870 --> 54:18.621
lt looks like...

54:18.788 --> 54:23.000
- ...they were running from something.
- Okay. Don't touch, okay?

54:23.585 --> 54:27.797
Man, this thing is opened up
from the inside.

54:27.964 --> 54:29.507
Almost like it exploded.

54:30.508 --> 54:34.511
Looks like a scene out some sort
of holocaust painting, you know?

54:47.733 --> 54:48.943
Well....

54:54.532 --> 54:57.743
So, whatever killed them
is long gone, right?

54:57.952 --> 54:58.994
Millburn, Fifield.

54:59.161 --> 55:00.329
This is Prometheus.

55:00.496 --> 55:01.705
What is your position?

55:02.539 --> 55:04.333
Prometheus, this is Millburn.

55:04.625 --> 55:06.544
We are at 7-4-0...

55:06.711 --> 55:08.921
...1-4-7-7. Why?

55:09.171 --> 55:12.675
Just got a ping
about one click west of you.

55:12.842 --> 55:14.427
What do you mean "a ping"?

55:14.885 --> 55:16.554
Well, whatever...

55:16.720 --> 55:18.723
...that probe is picking up...

55:18.890 --> 55:20.058
...it's not dead.

55:20.225 --> 55:21.893
lt's reading a life form.

55:22.101 --> 55:24.562
- What?
- Okay, what do you mean, "a life form"?

55:25.062 --> 55:26.647
ls it--? ls it moving?

55:27.439 --> 55:29.358
No, l don't think so.

55:29.650 --> 55:30.985
Captain, you're...

55:31.152 --> 55:32.695
...obviously not seeing...

55:32.862 --> 55:34.238
...what we're seeing here.

55:34.405 --> 55:36.657
If you were,
you wouldn't be talking about a ping.

55:36.824 --> 55:38.117
l know, boys.

55:38.451 --> 55:41.704
Your signal has been coming in
sporadically since the storm hit.

55:42.913 --> 55:44.416
That's no good to us down here!

55:45.959 --> 55:49.879
ls it--? ls it moving?
Are these things moving?

55:52.756 --> 55:55.676
No. No, itjust disappeared, actually.

55:56.260 --> 55:57.345
Must be a glitch.

55:57.512 --> 55:59.972
What do you mean, "a glitch"?

56:00.181 --> 56:01.098
All right, boys.

56:02.182 --> 56:03.392
Sleep tight.

56:04.269 --> 56:05.770
Try not to bugger each other.

56:05.937 --> 56:07.939
Captain, what do you mean, "a glitch"?

56:08.564 --> 56:11.109
Millburn, what does he mean? Wait.

56:11.693 --> 56:13.153
Now, he said--

56:14.237 --> 56:16.948
- He said one click west, yeah?
- Yeah.

56:17.782 --> 56:19.074
Now, we....

56:19.241 --> 56:21.118
We don't want to check that out, do we?

56:21.285 --> 56:22.286
Shit, no.

56:22.536 --> 56:23.788
Where are we gonna go?

56:23.955 --> 56:24.956
East.

56:26.582 --> 56:27.833
Yeah, east.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.088
A fucking glitch, man.
"Pings, glitch, life form." What the fuck?

56:32.338 --> 56:36.550
Based on the behavior of the subject
in these holographic recordings...

56:36.759 --> 56:39.429
...we're attempting to identify
what caused the head...

56:39.596 --> 56:41.764
...to combust. l can't help but wonder...

56:42.348 --> 56:44.767
...was there an outbreak here?

56:49.521 --> 56:50.481
You rang...

56:50.648 --> 56:52.775
- ...ma'am?
- l have something important...

56:53.025 --> 56:54.819
...to tell you. What is that?

56:55.653 --> 56:57.280
This is...

56:57.447 --> 56:59.824
...a rose that l had frozen
with the champagne.

56:59.991 --> 57:03.077
l was gonna give it to you
when we found what we came for.

57:04.371 --> 57:06.206
We did find what we came for.

57:06.581 --> 57:07.749
They were here. This is--

57:07.916 --> 57:12.503
The most significant discovery
in the history...

57:12.670 --> 57:14.838
...of mankind. Oh, l know.

57:17.675 --> 57:19.510
lt's incredible, it really is.

57:19.677 --> 57:23.472
But l wanted to talk to them.

57:23.848 --> 57:26.684
l mean, don't you want to know
why they came?

57:28.060 --> 57:29.645
Why they abandoned us?

57:30.021 --> 57:31.856
l just want answers, baby.

57:32.023 --> 57:33.483
We were right, Charlie.

57:33.942 --> 57:36.027
l have proof.

57:38.029 --> 57:38.946
Look.

57:44.952 --> 57:48.039
Their genetic material predates ours.

57:48.205 --> 57:49.707
We come from them.

57:51.167 --> 57:52.835
- You're kidding me.
- No.

57:55.838 --> 57:57.006
Okay.

57:57.549 --> 57:58.717
Okay.

57:59.718 --> 58:03.888
Okay. l guess you can take
your father's cross off now.

58:04.639 --> 58:06.891
Why would l want to do that?

58:07.391 --> 58:09.143
Because they made us.

58:09.351 --> 58:10.603
And who made them?

58:11.521 --> 58:13.564
Well, exactly. We'll never know.

58:13.731 --> 58:15.816
But here's what we do know:

58:15.983 --> 58:19.821
That there is nothing special
about the creation of life.

58:19.988 --> 58:21.405
Right? Anybody can do it.

58:21.614 --> 58:24.618
All you need is a dash of DNA
and half a brain, right?

58:27.579 --> 58:28.788
l can't.

58:30.373 --> 58:32.583
l can't create life.

58:34.460 --> 58:37.129
What does that say about me?

58:38.423 --> 58:41.425
Ellie, that's not-- l didn't mean--

58:41.592 --> 58:43.135
l wasn't talking about--

58:43.302 --> 58:44.971
Children?

58:45.263 --> 58:46.306
Us.

58:48.808 --> 58:51.019
Hey, hey, hey.

58:51.186 --> 58:52.562
Hey.

58:53.355 --> 58:54.647
Hey.

58:55.481 --> 58:57.358
Elizabeth Shaw...

58:57.525 --> 59:01.028
...you are the most special person
l have ever met in my life...

59:01.195 --> 59:03.030
...and l love you.

59:07.076 --> 59:08.327
Hey.

59:53.414 --> 59:54.874
How much longer will this take?

59:56.875 --> 59:58.419
l don't know.

59:58.586 --> 01:00:00.087
l'm just a captain.

01:00:09.222 --> 01:00:11.683
That thing sounds like a dying cat,
by the way.

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:15.687
l'll have you know that this thing...

01:00:15.853 --> 01:00:18.064
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.

01:00:19.357 --> 01:00:21.066
Am l supposed to know who that is?

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.532
You know...

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:29.784
...if you wanna get laid...

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.828
...you really don't have to pretend...

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:34.122
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.

01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:38.710
You could just say,
"Hey, l'm trying to get laid."

01:00:38.877 --> 01:00:41.087
l could. l could say that, right?

01:00:41.755 --> 01:00:43.214
But it wouldn't make sense...

01:00:43.381 --> 01:00:47.551
...why l would fly myself half a billion miles
from every man on Earth...

01:00:47.718 --> 01:00:49.720
...if l wanted to get laid, would it?

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:53.391
Hey, Vickers.

01:00:53.558 --> 01:00:55.393
Hey, Vickers.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.396
l was wondering....

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.068
Are you a robot?

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:13.786
My room.

01:01:14.912 --> 01:01:15.746
Ten minutes.

01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:23.921
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:25.048
Love the one

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:26.341
You're with

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:27.967
Love the one you're with

01:01:34.933 --> 01:01:36.100
Millburn.

01:01:36.267 --> 01:01:38.269
What's all this black stuff?

01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:43.691
Gazpacho.

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:47.278
ls that tobacco?

01:01:48.154 --> 01:01:49.071
ls that tobacco...

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.364
...in your respirator?

01:01:50.531 --> 01:01:52.117
Yeah, sure.

01:01:56.621 --> 01:01:58.123
Tobacco.

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.377
On behalf of scientists everywhere,
l am ashamed to count you amongst us...

01:02:02.627 --> 01:02:04.212
...Fifield. Really.

01:02:08.466 --> 01:02:09.550
- Hey, Millburn.
- Yeah?

01:02:09.758 --> 01:02:10.676
You see this thing?

01:02:10.801 --> 01:02:14.138
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?

01:02:14.639 --> 01:02:16.599
Something they worshiped? What?

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:18.560
- lt kind of looks like--
- What's that?

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:20.311
What the hell is that?

01:02:20.478 --> 01:02:21.729
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:23.231
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.

01:02:23.397 --> 01:02:25.650
This is okay, l can handle this.

01:02:26.318 --> 01:02:27.319
Hey, baby.

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:28.820
Hey.

01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:31.030
Come in, Prometheus.

01:02:31.322 --> 01:02:34.909
We have an elongate reptile-type creature.

01:02:35.159 --> 01:02:39.247
Maybe 30, 40 inches, with transparent skin.

01:02:39.664 --> 01:02:40.998
And it's beautiful.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.167
Okay!

01:02:46.588 --> 01:02:47.255
Prometheus...

01:02:47.422 --> 01:02:48.172
...we have two.

01:02:48.381 --> 01:02:50.842
Look at you. Look at you, baby.

01:02:51.343 --> 01:02:53.803
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.514
- You need to stay calm.
- What's there to be calm about?

01:02:56.681 --> 01:02:59.100
You need to stay calm
because she is beautiful.

01:02:59.267 --> 01:03:01.018
What makes you think that's female?

01:03:01.185 --> 01:03:02.436
She's a lady. Look!

01:03:08.526 --> 01:03:09.527
Hey.

01:03:10.403 --> 01:03:11.446
She's mesmerized.

01:03:11.863 --> 01:03:13.990
Come here. Come here.

01:03:16.242 --> 01:03:17.368
lt's okay.

01:03:17.535 --> 01:03:19.204
lt's okay. lt's okay.

01:03:19.955 --> 01:03:21.206
Hey, baby.

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:25.293
You're strong!

01:03:26.043 --> 01:03:26.669
You should...

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:27.503
...help me now.

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:28.337
Get it off.

01:03:30.923 --> 01:03:31.800
Cut it here, man!

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:33.051
l ain't touching that!

01:03:34.052 --> 01:03:36.053
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:03:36.262 --> 01:03:38.265
- lt's getting tighter.
- l ain't touching it!

01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:41.184
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!

01:03:41.392 --> 01:03:43.269
God, you're making it worse!

01:03:43.478 --> 01:03:45.272
lt's tightening! lt's tight--

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:46.898
lt's breaking my arm!

01:03:48.733 --> 01:03:49.442
Shit!

01:03:49.818 --> 01:03:50.693
Cut it off!

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.570
Cut it off!

01:03:52.737 --> 01:03:53.571
Cut it off!

01:03:53.738 --> 01:03:54.363
Cut it off!

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:57.993
Shit!

01:03:58.159 --> 01:03:58.910
Oh, my God!

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:02.246
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:04.916
lt's in my suit.

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:05.876
Jesus Christ.

01:05:05.978 --> 01:05:07.771
Shaw, you up?

01:05:09.481 --> 01:05:10.648
Yeah, what's up?

01:05:11.024 --> 01:05:13.234
The storm passed,
but l can't reach Millburn...

01:05:13.401 --> 01:05:16.612
...or Fifield. Taking a few men down,
see if l can rustle them up.

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:17.863
Okay.

01:05:18.823 --> 01:05:20.408
Any idea where they are?

01:05:20.575 --> 01:05:24.245
Last time they radioed in
was where you found your head.

01:05:24.788 --> 01:05:26.748
Okay, we're coming.

01:05:26.915 --> 01:05:27.666
All right.

01:05:27.832 --> 01:05:30.668
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.

01:05:30.835 --> 01:05:31.837
All right, boss.

01:05:33.672 --> 01:05:36.466
- Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
- No, captain.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:39.427
- lt's gotta be in the hardware.
- What glitch, captain?

01:05:39.552 --> 01:05:42.096
One of them probes picked up a life form.

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:43.764
Pops up every hour...

01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:46.851
...for a couple of seconds
and then it's gone.

01:05:47.018 --> 01:05:48.603
l can find the probe and fix it.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.354
Knock yourself out.

01:05:51.732 --> 01:05:53.191
Be careful, doctors.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.172
Fifield!

01:06:18.925 --> 01:06:20.093
Millburn?

01:06:24.389 --> 01:06:25.766
All right, come on down.

01:06:46.786 --> 01:06:49.747
David, are you alone?

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:52.000
Yes, Miss Vickers.

01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:54.336
Uplink your feed to my room.

01:06:54.503 --> 01:06:55.795
Copy.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:40.609
You son of a bitch.

01:08:42.736 --> 01:08:44.404
You cut me off.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:07.051
What is this?

01:09:10.555 --> 01:09:11.765
- Charlie?
- l just tripped.

01:09:12.057 --> 01:09:13.183
Oh, my God, you're sick!

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:15.309
l'm okay, baby. Come on.

01:09:15.475 --> 01:09:16.519
Fifield?

01:09:17.395 --> 01:09:18.563
Millburn?

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:26.571
Hey, Chance. l wouldn't touch...

01:09:26.738 --> 01:09:27.906
...that if l were you.

01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:32.118
Dr. Shaw?

01:09:32.286 --> 01:09:33.412
Yeah?

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.538
Do we have any idea what is...

01:09:35.747 --> 01:09:37.165
...oozing out of these vases?

01:09:37.332 --> 01:09:40.501
No. They weren't like this
last time we were here.

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:46.341
Captain?

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:47.801
What?

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:49.010
Who is it? Which one?

01:09:49.176 --> 01:09:51.011
- Who is it?
- lt's Millburn.

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.432
- Ellie.
- Don't touch him. Hold on.

01:09:53.598 --> 01:09:54.432
Ellie, honey.

01:09:54.599 --> 01:09:56.434
Charlie, what's wrong?

01:09:56.601 --> 01:09:59.146
l need you to look at me, okay?

01:09:59.313 --> 01:10:00.439
You know infections...

01:10:00.606 --> 01:10:01.648
...so, what do you see?

01:10:01.815 --> 01:10:03.441
This is not good, baby.

01:10:03.608 --> 01:10:05.527
You look at me,
you tell me what you see.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.656
Oh, my God.

01:10:11.115 --> 01:10:12.701
Ford, get over here.

01:10:12.868 --> 01:10:14.452
lt's okay. Janek?

01:10:14.619 --> 01:10:16.246
- What?
- We have to go now!

01:10:16.454 --> 01:10:17.121
What do you see?

01:10:17.288 --> 01:10:19.291
Honey, what do you see?

01:10:19.499 --> 01:10:21.543
Holloway's sick. He's not good.

01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:22.294
l see movement...

01:10:22.502 --> 01:10:23.128
...in his esophagus.

01:10:27.466 --> 01:10:29.134
- Come on, baby.
- No. l'm okay.

01:10:29.301 --> 01:10:30.260
Janek!

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:31.595
Come over and help me!

01:10:31.803 --> 01:10:34.138
- l'm okay.
- Ford, get over there. What's happening?

01:10:34.305 --> 01:10:35.306
- l'm okay.
- Let's go!

01:10:35.473 --> 01:10:36.557
Help me with him.

01:10:36.807 --> 01:10:39.644
l got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:10:39.853 --> 01:10:40.478
Prometheus...

01:10:40.645 --> 01:10:41.312
...come in.

01:10:41.479 --> 01:10:43.398
- Watch your head.
- Okay. l'm okay.

01:10:43.564 --> 01:10:45.317
- Holloway.
- Get him up.

01:10:45.484 --> 01:10:47.319
- Come on.
- Prometheus, come in.

01:10:47.486 --> 01:10:48.653
ls anyone there?

01:10:49.321 --> 01:10:50.572
This is Vickers.

01:10:50.739 --> 01:10:53.200
l need a medical team
standing by the airlock.

01:10:53.534 --> 01:10:55.577
Full quarantine fail-safe.

01:10:55.744 --> 01:10:57.204
Holloway's sick.

01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:58.622
Sick with what?

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.915
- Just do it.
- Let's get him back to the ship.

01:11:01.082 --> 01:11:03.126
- lt's not safe down here.
- Charlie?

01:11:03.334 --> 01:11:04.168
l'm suiting up.

01:11:04.335 --> 01:11:06.004
- Charlie, talk to me.
- Move!

01:11:06.171 --> 01:11:08.506
- What was that back there?
- Let's go, people!

01:11:10.216 --> 01:11:12.386
We've gotta move!
We've gotta move!

01:11:12.553 --> 01:11:13.428
Ellie!

01:15:10.915 --> 01:15:12.125
He don't look too good.

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:15.045
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off.

01:15:15.212 --> 01:15:15.921
l don't know.

01:15:16.213 --> 01:15:19.216
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.

01:15:19.592 --> 01:15:20.676
Aye, captain.

01:15:20.885 --> 01:15:23.220
Oh, God. l'm so sorry.

01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:26.181
Come on!

01:15:26.348 --> 01:15:28.058
Please!

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:35.398
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?

01:15:35.941 --> 01:15:37.776
Vickers, that is an order!

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:40.237
Get that goddamn door open!

01:15:40.362 --> 01:15:42.906
- Look at me. lt's too late, l'm sick.
- No, it's not.

01:15:43.073 --> 01:15:44.282
Come on!

01:15:44.991 --> 01:15:45.700
Ford, help me!

01:15:46.077 --> 01:15:48.120
Airlock crew, if you can hear me,
it's Janek.

01:15:48.287 --> 01:15:49.913
Open that back door right now!

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.248
Hold that door!

01:15:51.456 --> 01:15:52.082
Prometheus...

01:15:52.249 --> 01:15:52.999
...do you copy?

01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:55.668
Goddamn it, open that door!
That is an order!

01:15:55.835 --> 01:15:56.920
Open it.

01:16:03.968 --> 01:16:05.261
What the hell is this?

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:06.972
He's not coming onboard.

01:16:07.139 --> 01:16:08.599
Vickers, this is a sick man.

01:16:08.807 --> 01:16:09.933
l see that. That's why...

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.142
...he's not coming on!

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:12.937
Charlie!

01:16:13.104 --> 01:16:14.146
Chance, get over here!

01:16:17.441 --> 01:16:18.150
Please!

01:16:18.317 --> 01:16:19.401
We can still help him!

01:16:21.069 --> 01:16:23.655
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship!

01:16:23.821 --> 01:16:25.406
l won't leave him!

01:16:25.573 --> 01:16:26.408
Then stay!

01:16:26.575 --> 01:16:27.743
Wait! We could...

01:16:27.909 --> 01:16:29.619
...put him on the Med-Pod!

01:16:29.786 --> 01:16:30.829
Please don't do this.

01:16:30.995 --> 01:16:32.330
lt's okay, Ellie.

01:16:32.497 --> 01:16:33.499
Vickers!

01:16:33.665 --> 01:16:34.666
What are you doing?

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:36.126
l love you, baby.

01:16:36.293 --> 01:16:37.127
- l love you.
- No.

01:16:37.335 --> 01:16:38.587
l'm telling you, stay back!

01:16:38.753 --> 01:16:39.463
Do it.

01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:40.506
Stay back!

01:16:40.673 --> 01:16:41.757
No! No, Charlie!

01:16:41.924 --> 01:16:42.508
- Do it.
- No!

01:16:48.263 --> 01:16:49.472
No!

01:16:51.557 --> 01:16:53.018
No!

01:16:53.352 --> 01:16:55.020
No!

01:16:58.690 --> 01:16:59.775
Charlie!

01:17:02.527 --> 01:17:04.154
No!

01:17:17.542 --> 01:17:19.503
My deepest condolences.

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:22.631
l'm going to have to take this.

01:17:22.797 --> 01:17:24.341
lt may be contaminated.

01:17:25.467 --> 01:17:29.513
lf there's a contagion,
we were all exposed.

01:17:31.098 --> 01:17:34.894
You need-- We need to run blood work
on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.

01:17:35.561 --> 01:17:36.937
Yes, of course.

01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:38.522
Yes?

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:48.240
l understand how...

01:17:48.407 --> 01:17:49.908
...inappropriate this is...

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.037
...given the circumstances.

01:17:53.203 --> 01:17:56.206
But as you ordered
quarantine fail-safes...

01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:00.336
...it's my responsibility to ask.

01:18:01.253 --> 01:18:05.424
Have you and Dr. Holloway
had any intimate contact recently?

01:18:06.758 --> 01:18:07.926
Since you and he were...

01:18:08.093 --> 01:18:09.344
...so close...

01:18:10.261 --> 01:18:11.095
...l want to be...

01:18:11.262 --> 01:18:12.723
...as thorough as poss--

01:18:14.725 --> 01:18:15.559
My, my.

01:18:19.772 --> 01:18:20.648
You're pregnant.

01:18:23.525 --> 01:18:24.192
What?

01:18:25.694 --> 01:18:27.446
From the look of it, three months so.

01:18:27.905 --> 01:18:30.991
No, that's impossible.

01:18:31.325 --> 01:18:33.410
l can't be pregnant.

01:18:33.702 --> 01:18:37.038
Did you have intercourse
with Dr. Holloway?

01:18:37.872 --> 01:18:39.082
Yes...

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:42.294
...but 10 hours ago.

01:18:42.627 --> 01:18:46.132
There's no bloody way
l'm three months pregnant.

01:18:46.298 --> 01:18:47.132
Well, doctor...

01:18:48.133 --> 01:18:50.218
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus.

01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:54.807
l want to see it.

01:18:55.099 --> 01:18:56.809
Don't think that's a good idea.

01:18:58.644 --> 01:19:01.479
David, l want to see it.

01:19:01.771 --> 01:19:02.981
Now, doctor....

01:19:05.483 --> 01:19:06.985
l want to see it.

01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:09.488
l want it out of me.

01:19:09.738 --> 01:19:11.323
We don't have the personnel...

01:19:11.489 --> 01:19:13.951
...to perform a procedure like that.

01:19:14.159 --> 01:19:15.953
- Our best option--
- l want it out.

01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:17.162
Put you back into...

01:19:17.329 --> 01:19:19.247
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.

01:19:19.414 --> 01:19:21.709
Please, get it out of me.

01:19:22.042 --> 01:19:23.460
Get it out of me!

01:19:23.752 --> 01:19:24.837
Please.

01:19:28.506 --> 01:19:30.175
lt must be very painful.

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.178
Here, let me give you something.

01:19:37.182 --> 01:19:38.850
That's it. There, there.

01:19:45.273 --> 01:19:47.860
Someone will be along shortly...

01:19:48.152 --> 01:19:50.529
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck.

01:19:54.866 --> 01:19:57.077
lt must feel
like your God abandoned you.

01:19:57.702 --> 01:19:58.870
What?

01:19:59.037 --> 01:19:59.788
To lose...

01:19:59.997 --> 01:20:04.709
...Dr. Holloway after your father died
under such similar circumstances.

01:20:05.293 --> 01:20:07.379
What was it that killed him?

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.590
Ebola?

01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:16.722
How do you--? How do you know that?

01:20:17.848 --> 01:20:19.641
l watched your dreams.

01:20:42.206 --> 01:20:43.290
Dr. Shaw?

01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:45.751
We're here to put you...

01:20:45.918 --> 01:20:49.296
...in an anti-contamination suit,
take you back to Cryo Deck...

01:20:49.462 --> 01:20:51.089
...go to beddy-byes.

01:20:51.798 --> 01:20:53.258
Dr. Shaw?

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.219
She's doped. Prepare her.

01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:30.504
Emergency procedures initiated.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury.

01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:33.090
l need a Caesarean.

01:21:33.633 --> 01:21:35.801
Error. This Med-Pod is calibrated for male...

01:21:35.968 --> 01:21:37.511
...patients and does not offer...

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.681
...the procedure you have requested.
Seek medical assistance...

01:21:40.806 --> 01:21:41.807
...elsewhere.

01:21:44.184 --> 01:21:44.934
Surgery.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:46.645
Abdominal.

01:21:47.354 --> 01:21:48.105
Penetrating...

01:21:48.272 --> 01:21:49.606
...injuries.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.525
Foreign body.

01:21:51.858 --> 01:21:52.901
lnitiate.

01:21:55.571 --> 01:21:57.447
Surgical procedure to begin.

01:22:38.947 --> 01:22:39.990
Running diagnostics.

01:22:43.535 --> 01:22:44.870
Oh, come on.

01:22:46.454 --> 01:22:48.707
Get it out! Come on!

01:22:49.124 --> 01:22:49.792
Please!

01:22:53.170 --> 01:22:54.505
Oh, God!

01:22:56.715 --> 01:22:58.550
- Come on!
- lnitiating anesthetics.

01:22:59.718 --> 01:23:00.385
Please!

01:23:06.976 --> 01:23:08.852
Commence surgical procedure.

01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:50.769
Oh, God.

01:23:54.398 --> 01:23:55.107
Oh, God!

01:23:55.232 --> 01:23:56.608
Oh, God!

01:24:15.127 --> 01:24:16.796
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:24:17.004 --> 01:24:18.255
Oh, my God!

01:24:35.064 --> 01:24:36.232
Come on!

01:25:02.466 --> 01:25:03.133
Bridge...

01:25:03.342 --> 01:25:04.885
...to hangar. This is the captain.

01:25:05.052 --> 01:25:07.013
- Yes, captain.
- Can you see what l see?

01:25:07.388 --> 01:25:09.265
Fifield's monitorjust popped up.

01:25:09.682 --> 01:25:11.517
What? Where?

01:25:11.684 --> 01:25:14.103
According to what l'm looking at,
it's outside...

01:25:14.269 --> 01:25:15.437
...the goddamn ship.

01:25:15.854 --> 01:25:17.022
Barnes, open the door!

01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:19.190
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.

01:25:20.108 --> 01:25:20.818
Fifield?

01:25:33.121 --> 01:25:34.374
Wait a second.

01:25:43.548 --> 01:25:44.466
Hey, Wallace.

01:25:44.633 --> 01:25:45.884
Take a look at this.

01:25:51.556 --> 01:25:52.057
Fifield?

01:25:55.061 --> 01:25:57.021
What the hell is going on down there?

01:26:10.909 --> 01:26:12.035
l'm coming down there.

01:26:12.202 --> 01:26:13.369
Chance, you're suiting up.

01:26:13.621 --> 01:26:15.247
- Come on.
- Don't let it on the ship!

01:26:30.388 --> 01:26:30.805
Take him out!

01:26:31.722 --> 01:26:32.181
Got him!

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.225
Do it!

01:26:39.104 --> 01:26:41.232
- You ready, Chance?
- Yes.

01:26:44.234 --> 01:26:45.068
Come on!

01:26:45.277 --> 01:26:46.445
Get in the rover!

01:26:47.363 --> 01:26:48.614
We gotta get out of here!

01:26:55.788 --> 01:26:56.622
Go!

01:27:28.153 --> 01:27:29.446
What is that?

01:28:04.857 --> 01:28:07.025
You've been asleep.

01:28:07.193 --> 01:28:09.862
You were on the ship all this time. Why?

01:28:11.322 --> 01:28:12.781
Well, l....

01:28:12.948 --> 01:28:14.826
l have a few days of life left in me.

01:28:16.035 --> 01:28:17.328
l didn't wanna waste them...

01:28:17.495 --> 01:28:19.705
...until you could deliver
what you promised.

01:28:20.914 --> 01:28:22.458
To meet my maker.

01:28:22.624 --> 01:28:23.834
There we are, sir.

01:28:24.042 --> 01:28:27.213
- Nice and clean.
- Haven't you told him they're all gone?

01:28:28.797 --> 01:28:31.967
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.

01:28:32.217 --> 01:28:33.886
One of them is still alive.

01:28:34.637 --> 01:28:36.514
We're on our way to see him now.

01:28:36.806 --> 01:28:37.890
What?

01:28:38.265 --> 01:28:39.558
Turn me around.

01:28:40.267 --> 01:28:45.064
You convinced me that...

01:28:46.607 --> 01:28:48.776
...if these things made us...

01:28:50.027 --> 01:28:52.571
...then surely they could save us.

01:28:53.238 --> 01:28:54.198
My stick, please.

01:28:58.911 --> 01:29:01.122
Well, save me, anyway.

01:29:01.622 --> 01:29:03.624
Save you from what?

01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:05.709
Death, of course.

01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:07.085
Stand me up.

01:29:11.549 --> 01:29:12.550
l'm all right.

01:29:13.384 --> 01:29:14.551
l'm all right.

01:29:15.552 --> 01:29:16.720
Yes, sir.

01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:18.180
But you don't understand.

01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:20.265
You don't know.

01:29:20.432 --> 01:29:23.227
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...

01:29:23.394 --> 01:29:25.437
...what we thought they were.

01:29:25.604 --> 01:29:26.772
l was wrong.

01:29:26.938 --> 01:29:28.191
We were so wrong.

01:29:28.733 --> 01:29:30.151
Charlie....

01:29:30.776 --> 01:29:32.945
Dr. Holloway's dead.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.282
We must leave!

01:29:36.783 --> 01:29:38.743
And what would Charlie do...

01:29:39.035 --> 01:29:43.914
...now that we're so close...

01:29:44.206 --> 01:29:47.585
...to answering
the most meaningful questions...

01:29:47.752 --> 01:29:49.295
...ever asked by mankind?

01:29:50.671 --> 01:29:52.381
How can you leave without...

01:29:52.589 --> 01:29:54.550
...knowing what they are?

01:30:01.558 --> 01:30:03.601
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?

01:30:39.719 --> 01:30:42.473
Okay. Okay.

01:31:01.825 --> 01:31:03.202
Come in.

01:31:10.376 --> 01:31:12.377
Where the hell are you going, doc?

01:31:12.711 --> 01:31:14.714
You know what this place is?

01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:18.843
Those Engineers? This ain't their home.

01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:22.680
lt's an installation.
Maybe even military.

01:31:23.222 --> 01:31:25.933
They put it out here
because they're not stupid enough...

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.353
...to make weapons of mass destruction
on their own doorstep.

01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:33.565
That's what all that shit is
in those vases.

01:31:33.982 --> 01:31:35.151
They made it here.

01:31:35.401 --> 01:31:39.446
lt got out, it turned on them. The end.

01:31:41.449 --> 01:31:43.534
lt's time for us to go home.

01:31:44.076 --> 01:31:45.911
One of them is still alive.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.044
Don't you want to know
what they have to say?

01:31:56.505 --> 01:31:58.173
l don't care.

01:32:00.092 --> 01:32:01.219
Right.

01:32:02.011 --> 01:32:03.929
All you do is fly the ship.

01:32:04.263 --> 01:32:05.431
That's right.

01:32:05.597 --> 01:32:09.227
But you must care
about something, captain.

01:32:11.562 --> 01:32:14.315
lf you didn't, why are you here?

01:32:17.276 --> 01:32:18.778
How about this?

01:32:20.738 --> 01:32:23.032
No matter what happens down there...

01:32:24.324 --> 01:32:26.785
...l can't bring none of that shit
back home with us.

01:32:26.952 --> 01:32:28.246
Can't let it happen.

01:32:29.747 --> 01:32:31.123
l'll do whatever l have to...

01:32:31.332 --> 01:32:33.041
...to see that it doesn't.

01:32:34.919 --> 01:32:36.420
Make sure you do, captain.

01:32:51.977 --> 01:32:54.104
So you came after all.

01:32:54.397 --> 01:32:55.940
l thought you wanted me to.

01:32:56.232 --> 01:32:58.692
After all your attempts
to stop me from coming here...

01:32:58.901 --> 01:33:00.319
...l'm surprised to see you.

01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:02.280
lt's all right. Leave us.

01:33:02.864 --> 01:33:04.282
Yes, sir.

01:33:16.335 --> 01:33:17.002
lf you're...

01:33:17.211 --> 01:33:18.837
...going down there, you will die.

01:33:21.966 --> 01:33:23.801
Very negative way of looking at things.

01:33:26.011 --> 01:33:28.306
That's exactly why
you should have stayed at home.

01:33:28.848 --> 01:33:31.851
Did you really think l was gonna
sit in a boardroom for years...

01:33:32.018 --> 01:33:33.686
...arguing over who was in charge...

01:33:33.852 --> 01:33:37.190
...while you go look for some miracle
on some...

01:33:37.357 --> 01:33:41.027
...godforsaken rock
in the middle of space?

01:33:43.946 --> 01:33:45.697
A king has...

01:33:45.822 --> 01:33:48.409
...his reign, and then he dies.

01:33:49.285 --> 01:33:50.661
lt's inevitable.

01:33:53.163 --> 01:33:54.499
That...

01:33:55.208 --> 01:33:57.210
...is the natural order of things.

01:34:10.055 --> 01:34:11.432
Anything else?

01:34:13.308 --> 01:34:14.685
No...

01:34:15.978 --> 01:34:17.563
...Father.

01:34:19.148 --> 01:34:20.023
That's it.

01:34:33.079 --> 01:34:34.705
l didn't think you had it in you.

01:34:35.581 --> 01:34:36.207
Sorry.

01:34:36.373 --> 01:34:38.750
Poor choice of words.

01:34:40.043 --> 01:34:43.339
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.

01:34:48.344 --> 01:34:50.012
What happens when Weyland is not...

01:34:50.179 --> 01:34:51.430
...around to program you?

01:34:52.473 --> 01:34:54.099
l suppose l'll be free.

01:34:55.018 --> 01:34:56.352
You want that?

01:34:56.519 --> 01:34:58.062
"Want"?

01:34:58.229 --> 01:35:00.106
Not a concept l'm familiar with.

01:35:00.398 --> 01:35:01.941
That being said...

01:35:02.983 --> 01:35:05.027
...doesn't everyone
want their parents dead?

01:35:07.029 --> 01:35:08.072
l didn't.

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.032
Dr. Shaw.

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:13.077
So pleased you could join us.

01:35:27.925 --> 01:35:30.052
You can take your helmet off
if you like, sir.

01:35:30.219 --> 01:35:30.970
What?

01:35:31.136 --> 01:35:33.639
The air is perfectly breathable.

01:35:33.805 --> 01:35:34.974
Are you sure?

01:35:35.141 --> 01:35:36.142
Positive.

01:35:36.684 --> 01:35:41.439
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. lf it's in the air.

01:35:42.023 --> 01:35:43.441
lt's not.

01:35:43.733 --> 01:35:45.484
How do you know that?

01:35:45.776 --> 01:35:46.777
Smells fine to me.

01:35:49.447 --> 01:35:50.823
- Shall we?
- Please.

01:35:56.328 --> 01:35:58.080
The bridge is just up ahead.

01:35:58.247 --> 01:35:59.331
What is this?

01:36:00.499 --> 01:36:02.335
lt's a cargo hold.

01:36:11.385 --> 01:36:14.013
Janek? Are you seeing this?

01:36:15.307 --> 01:36:16.516
How many is there, Shaw?

01:36:16.683 --> 01:36:17.392
Thousands.

01:36:18.851 --> 01:36:20.728
What the hell?

01:36:24.565 --> 01:36:26.483
Ravel, give me those schematics.

01:36:29.362 --> 01:36:31.489
Putting it on the table now.

01:36:32.865 --> 01:36:33.866
Strip away the dome.

01:36:34.491 --> 01:36:37.286
lsolate that area, bring it up.

01:36:37.453 --> 01:36:39.080
Bringing it up, captain.

01:36:42.167 --> 01:36:43.251
Enlarge that.

01:36:45.378 --> 01:36:46.712
Rotate it.

01:36:50.799 --> 01:36:52.342
That is a ship.

01:36:53.302 --> 01:36:54.846
Jesus Christ.

01:36:56.806 --> 01:36:58.849
lt's a goddamn ship.

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.730
A superior species, no doubt.

01:37:07.024 --> 01:37:09.569
Their hypersleep chambers...

01:37:09.736 --> 01:37:12.447
...will impress, l trust.

01:37:21.413 --> 01:37:22.081
So they...

01:37:22.248 --> 01:37:26.043
- ...were traveling somewhere.
- l've managed to work out the broad strokes.

01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:29.088
lt's fairly evident
they were in the process of leaving...

01:37:31.049 --> 01:37:33.217
...before things went to pot.

01:37:33.509 --> 01:37:34.886
Leaving to go where?

01:37:36.763 --> 01:37:37.430
Earth.

01:37:38.765 --> 01:37:39.515
Why?

01:37:40.641 --> 01:37:42.643
Sometimes to create...

01:37:42.977 --> 01:37:44.728
...one must first destroy.

01:37:46.939 --> 01:37:48.274
Where is he, David?

01:37:49.567 --> 01:37:50.610
This way, sir.

01:37:57.033 --> 01:37:58.451
Are you sure he's alive?

01:38:00.244 --> 01:38:01.287
Absolutely.

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:07.168
And you can speak to him?

01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:08.961
l believe l can.

01:38:45.247 --> 01:38:46.832
l'm all right, l'm all right.

01:38:48.668 --> 01:38:49.919
Speak to him, David.

01:38:51.254 --> 01:38:53.005
Tell him we came, just like he asked.

01:38:53.214 --> 01:38:54.340
Ask where they're from.

01:38:54.966 --> 01:38:55.842
What are you doing?

01:38:56.009 --> 01:38:57.677
Ask him what's in his cargo.

01:38:57.844 --> 01:38:58.678
lt killed his people.

01:38:58.845 --> 01:38:59.971
Shaw, enough.

01:39:00.263 --> 01:39:02.014
- David.
- You made it here...

01:39:02.515 --> 01:39:05.184
...and it was meant for us. Why?

01:39:05.351 --> 01:39:07.186
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up.

01:39:09.355 --> 01:39:10.439
l need to know why!

01:39:10.648 --> 01:39:12.358
What did we do wrong? Why do you...

01:39:12.566 --> 01:39:13.984
- ...hate us?
- She opens her...

01:39:14.151 --> 01:39:15.195
...mouth again, shoot her.

01:39:15.362 --> 01:39:17.280
David, continue. Tell him why l came.

01:39:38.175 --> 01:39:38.926
No!

01:39:45.058 --> 01:39:46.058
Ford! Move!

01:40:05.202 --> 01:40:08.957
There's nothing.

01:40:14.086 --> 01:40:15.881
l know.

01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:19.551
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

01:40:26.015 --> 01:40:27.599
Time to go home.

01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:44.117
Mr. Chance, take us home.

01:41:57.148 --> 01:41:58.024
Oh, no!

01:42:05.865 --> 01:42:06.866
Hey, cap.

01:42:07.408 --> 01:42:08.493
What the hell was that?

01:42:52.745 --> 01:42:53.538
Prometheus!

01:42:54.038 --> 01:42:55.081
Come in!

01:42:55.916 --> 01:42:57.167
Shaw, is that you?

01:42:57.334 --> 01:42:58.084
Copy.

01:42:58.251 --> 01:42:58.918
Janek...

01:42:59.085 --> 01:43:00.086
...listen to me.

01:43:01.004 --> 01:43:02.255
This ship is taking off!

01:43:02.422 --> 01:43:04.048
- What?
- What is she talking about?

01:43:04.215 --> 01:43:05.800
You can't let it leave!

01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:07.092
You have to stop it!

01:43:07.426 --> 01:43:10.054
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.

01:43:10.555 --> 01:43:12.598
Janek, if you don't stop it...

01:43:12.765 --> 01:43:14.600
...there won't be any home to go back to.

01:43:16.603 --> 01:43:19.230
lt's carrying death, and it's headed for Earth.

01:43:19.522 --> 01:43:21.899
- Shaw, this is not a warship.
- l know.

01:43:22.108 --> 01:43:22.859
Let's go.

01:43:23.068 --> 01:43:24.277
l know that.

01:43:24.945 --> 01:43:26.738
But you must do it.

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.948
Captain, let's go!

01:43:29.157 --> 01:43:31.200
Janek, please believe me! Please!

01:43:46.883 --> 01:43:49.303
l told you to get this ship going.

01:43:49.511 --> 01:43:50.303
Mr. Ravel.

01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:51.805
Warm up the ion propulsion.

01:43:52.138 --> 01:43:53.807
- What are you talking about?
- Sir.

01:43:53.973 --> 01:43:55.642
Burning ion in the atmosphere--

01:43:55.808 --> 01:43:58.894
- Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
- What are you doing?

01:43:59.061 --> 01:44:00.813
This is my ship. l'm telling you...

01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:02.064
...to take us home!

01:44:02.232 --> 01:44:03.691
Vickers, l'll eject your module onto...

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.651
...that surface. Two years of life.

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.778
You want it, or you want to stay with me?

01:44:08.737 --> 01:44:10.073
You got 40 seconds to get...

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.241
...to the escape pod.

01:44:11.408 --> 01:44:12.492
You're crazy.

01:44:12.659 --> 01:44:13.409
Gentlemen...

01:44:14.035 --> 01:44:15.662
...l can handle this myself.

01:44:16.163 --> 01:44:17.873
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.

01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:20.166
All due respect, captain.

01:44:20.333 --> 01:44:23.586
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna
need all the help you can get.

01:44:39.852 --> 01:44:44.024
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

01:44:44.191 --> 01:44:46.401
lf you think this means the bet's off...

01:44:47.777 --> 01:44:49.028
...you're wrong.

01:44:50.696 --> 01:44:53.032
Why don't you pay me on the other side?

01:44:53.199 --> 01:44:55.284
All right, get us as close as we can.

01:44:55.451 --> 01:44:57.370
Only got one shot at this.

01:45:10.467 --> 01:45:11.134
Lifeboats away!

01:45:16.389 --> 01:45:17.348
Twenty seconds...

01:45:17.515 --> 01:45:18.516
...to evacuate.

01:45:26.399 --> 01:45:28.192
- Countdown initiated.
- lon propulsion...

01:45:28.359 --> 01:45:29.069
...is online.

01:45:29.444 --> 01:45:30.153
Ten.

01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:31.237
Nine.

01:45:31.529 --> 01:45:32.405
Come on!

01:45:32.572 --> 01:45:33.573
Eight.

01:45:45.835 --> 01:45:47.169
- Three.
- Let's do this.

01:45:47.336 --> 01:45:48.212
Two.

01:45:51.549 --> 01:45:52.425
lmpact imminent.

01:45:52.592 --> 01:45:54.010
Hands off!

01:46:30.881 --> 01:46:31.631
Oh, God.

01:47:19.179 --> 01:47:20.180
No. No.

01:47:20.388 --> 01:47:21.431
No! No! No!

01:47:37.697 --> 01:47:38.781
Oh, God.

01:47:55.215 --> 01:47:58.509
Warning: You have two minutes
of oxygen remaining.

01:48:46.933 --> 01:48:50.770
Warning: You have 30 seconds
of oxygen remaining.

01:49:04.367 --> 01:49:05.493
Airlock sealed.

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.623
Oxygen levels now stabilizing.

01:50:27.575 --> 01:50:29.535
Elizabeth, are you there?

01:50:30.037 --> 01:50:31.246
This is David.

01:50:32.456 --> 01:50:34.958
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, l'm here.

01:50:35.250 --> 01:50:37.544
You need to get out immediately.

01:50:37.877 --> 01:50:39.712
He's coming for you.

01:50:39.962 --> 01:50:41.005
Who's coming?

01:50:41.547 --> 01:50:42.673
Airlock breach.

01:50:51.266 --> 01:50:52.309
Die!

01:52:17.853 --> 01:52:20.314
l'm so sorry.

01:52:21.815 --> 01:52:23.650
Oh, God.

01:52:24.275 --> 01:52:25.652
l'm sorry.

01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:29.280
l'm sorry, Charlie, l can't do it.

01:52:29.447 --> 01:52:32.617
l can't do it anymore.

01:52:36.037 --> 01:52:37.497
Elizabeth.

01:52:39.458 --> 01:52:40.667
Are you there?

01:52:45.214 --> 01:52:46.673
Dr. Shaw...

01:52:47.382 --> 01:52:48.675
...can you hear me?

01:52:49.968 --> 01:52:51.219
Yes.

01:52:52.679 --> 01:52:54.847
Yes, l can hear you.

01:52:55.389 --> 01:52:57.267
l was afraid you were dead.

01:52:59.019 --> 01:53:01.980
You have no idea what afraid is.

01:53:02.814 --> 01:53:05.609
l know we've had our differences...

01:53:07.027 --> 01:53:08.486
...but, please...

01:53:09.404 --> 01:53:11.699
...l need to ask you for your help.

01:53:11.865 --> 01:53:14.409
Why the hell would l help you?

01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:20.039
Because, without me,
you'll never leave this place.

01:53:20.748 --> 01:53:23.877
Neither one of us is leaving this place.

01:53:24.336 --> 01:53:26.379
lt's not the only ship.

01:53:28.256 --> 01:53:30.342
There are many others.

01:53:31.718 --> 01:53:33.053
l can operate them.

01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:43.647
Dr. Shaw?

01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:57.661
Dr. Shaw!

01:53:59.079 --> 01:54:00.247
Over here.

01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:07.921
Where is my cross?

01:54:08.422 --> 01:54:10.298
The pouch in my utility belt.

01:54:29.067 --> 01:54:30.861
Even after all this...

01:54:31.111 --> 01:54:33.113
...you still believe, don't you?

01:54:33.947 --> 01:54:36.950
You said you could
understand their navigation...

01:54:37.492 --> 01:54:38.743
...use their maps.

01:54:40.745 --> 01:54:42.455
Yes, of course.

01:54:42.622 --> 01:54:44.958
Once we get
to one of their other ships...

01:54:45.125 --> 01:54:48.211
...finding a path to Earth
should be relatively straightforward.

01:54:48.962 --> 01:54:51.924
l don't want to go back
to where we came from.

01:54:53.759 --> 01:54:56.428
l want to go where they came from.

01:54:57.805 --> 01:55:00.224
Do you think you can do that, David?

01:55:04.102 --> 01:55:05.311
Yes.

01:55:05.937 --> 01:55:07.814
l believe l can.

01:55:17.157 --> 01:55:19.785
May l ask what you hope to achieve
by going there?

01:55:20.452 --> 01:55:22.537
They created us.

01:55:22.746 --> 01:55:24.290
Then they tried to kill us.

01:55:24.832 --> 01:55:26.750
They changed their minds.

01:55:28.335 --> 01:55:29.961
l deserve to know why.

01:55:32.213 --> 01:55:33.798
The answer is irrelevant.

01:55:34.841 --> 01:55:37.135
Does it matter why
they changed their minds?

01:55:37.844 --> 01:55:39.012
Yes.

01:55:40.347 --> 01:55:42.015
Yes, it does.

01:55:43.016 --> 01:55:44.184
l don't understand.

01:55:45.686 --> 01:55:46.812
Well...

01:55:48.855 --> 01:55:51.900
...l guess that's because
l'm a human being...

01:55:52.067 --> 01:55:53.569
...and you're a robot.

01:56:03.369 --> 01:56:04.329
l'm sorry.

01:56:04.496 --> 01:56:05.664
lt's quite all right.

01:56:20.888 --> 01:56:23.682
Final report of the vessel Prometheus.

01:56:23.849 --> 01:56:24.808
The ship and her...

01:56:24.975 --> 01:56:27.101
...entire crew are gone.

01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:29.187
If you're receiving this transmission...

01:56:29.353 --> 01:56:32.732
...make no attempt
to come to its point of origin.

01:56:32.899 --> 01:56:37.112
There is only death here now,
and l'm leaving it behind.

01:56:38.197 --> 01:56:39.990
lt is New Year's Day...

01:56:40.157 --> 01:56:43.201
...the year of our Lord, 2094.

01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.622
My name is Elizabeth Shaw...

01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:49.750
...the last survivor of the Prometheus.

01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:52.752
And l am still searching.
