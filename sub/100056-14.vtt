WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:05.184
Well, looks like Ms. Hirsch's
drug rash has almost resolved.

00:05.186 --> 00:07.354
Uh, she's reacting normally
to the new antibiotics.

00:07.356 --> 00:10.392
You know who's not
reacting normally? Jenny.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.362
She's clearly still into me.

00:14.246 --> 00:16.212
Uh, that Jenny?

00:16.213 --> 00:17.980
I thought she was the
one that called it off.

00:17.982 --> 00:19.702
Yeah, but you can't
just call off chemistry.

00:19.773 --> 00:21.108
We still got it.

00:22.209 --> 00:23.842
Check this out. Be cool.

00:23.844 --> 00:25.680
Morning, everybody!

00:28.881 --> 00:30.082
You feel that?

00:30.084 --> 00:31.984
It's palpable.

00:31.986 --> 00:34.022
Do I not know what "palpable" means?

00:35.054 --> 00:36.621
Buddy, it's over.

00:36.623 --> 00:38.255
On your <i> only</i> date,

00:38.413 --> 00:40.524
you abandoned the woman at a restaurant.

00:40.526 --> 00:42.027
That is not what happened.

00:42.029 --> 00:44.096
No, th-that's exactly what happened.

00:44.098 --> 00:47.633
The fat lady has sung, and the
song was called "It's Over".

00:47.635 --> 00:48.799
(CALEB CHUCKLES)

00:49.254 --> 00:51.579
Well, I, for one, am glad it's over.

00:51.581 --> 00:53.069
Keeping secrets makes me nervous.

00:53.071 --> 00:54.961
Yeah, and you should at least be happy

00:54.963 --> 00:56.201
that Carol never found out.

00:56.203 --> 00:57.804
Hey, guys. What are you talking about?

00:57.806 --> 00:59.039
- What?
- Uh, nothing. Sports.

00:59.041 --> 01:01.341
Oh, sports. What about sports?

01:01.343 --> 01:04.742
Just a lot of heteronormative
stuff about it. Bye.

01:04.745 --> 01:07.714
That was a little weird.

01:07.716 --> 01:09.768
Caleb's a little weird. You're
just questioning this now?

01:09.770 --> 01:10.851
Come on, Carol!

01:12.145 --> 01:14.336
Geez. We finally have
a night off tonight.

01:14.338 --> 01:15.922
You'd think people would be happier.

01:15.924 --> 01:20.226
Well, you know, Mercury's in
retrograde, the winter blahs,

01:20.228 --> 01:22.365
we work in a place where people die.

01:23.665 --> 01:25.788
Oh, Lexie. There's a friendly face.

01:25.790 --> 01:27.812
- What are you doing with your night off?
- Nothing.

01:27.814 --> 01:30.416
- Geez.
- Uh, sorry. Tough case.

01:30.418 --> 01:31.882
Oh, is it anything I can help you with?

01:31.906 --> 01:32.907
- Hands off, Carol!
- Oh.

01:34.275 --> 01:36.198
Okay, Dennis, something's up.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.243
Do you know what's going on?

01:37.245 --> 01:40.634
Oh, um, well... Carol,
I can't do this right now.

01:40.636 --> 01:44.080
- I need to go to work.
- You work right there!

01:44.082 --> 01:45.751
You don't know my life!

01:48.309 --> 01:51.366
- Is no one in a good mood?
- I'm in a good mood.

01:51.368 --> 01:52.570
Everyone's in a terrible mood.

I'll tell you, Eddie, I
don't know what's going on.

02:07.524 --> 02:09.723
With my liver?

02:09.726 --> 02:12.494
No, I know what's going
on with your liver.

02:12.496 --> 02:15.464
It's bad, and you need a new one.

02:15.466 --> 02:17.377
You know I can't understand
all your technical,

02:17.379 --> 02:19.647
- medical jargon, Carol.
- (LAUGHS): Yeah.

02:19.803 --> 02:21.769
Now, the good news is

02:21.771 --> 02:23.505
you're moving up on the transplant list.

02:23.507 --> 02:25.640
Yeah? I guess you guys
are all stuck with me

02:25.642 --> 02:26.794
till my new parts come in.

02:26.796 --> 02:28.243
Aw.

02:28.245 --> 02:30.111
Hey, Eddie,

02:30.113 --> 02:32.246
you spend a lot of time with everybody.

02:32.248 --> 02:34.114
Have you noticed people around here

02:34.116 --> 02:36.184
being especially grumpy lately?

02:36.186 --> 02:38.519
No, but when one of
your organs doesn't work,

02:38.521 --> 02:40.988
- people try to be positive around you.
- Yeah.

02:40.990 --> 02:43.658
It's one of the perks. Ooh.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.260
That and compression socks.

02:45.262 --> 02:47.125
Feels like my calves
are getting a nice hug.

02:47.127 --> 02:48.162
Oh.

02:48.164 --> 02:52.100
Yeah, it just seems like the
interns are all out of sync.

02:52.102 --> 02:54.035
You know, we became
really close this year,

02:54.037 --> 02:56.704
and then now, we're just,
like, drifting apart.

02:56.706 --> 03:00.174
And of course, it's my job to
bring everybody back together.

03:00.176 --> 03:02.547
Because you're the elder?

03:04.247 --> 03:08.016
No. I mean, obviously,
I'm the core of the group.

03:08.018 --> 03:11.653
See, in the fruit
bouquet of our friendship,

03:11.655 --> 03:14.722
Lexie and Daniel are the
cantaloupe and honeydew,

03:14.724 --> 03:16.726
Dennis is the hard pineapple...

03:18.194 --> 03:19.694
... Caleb is that weird fruit

03:20.069 --> 03:21.966
you're not sure if you
should eat it or not...

03:23.244 --> 03:27.035
... and I am the Styrofoam
that holds us all in place.

03:27.037 --> 03:28.239
I like kiwi.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.873
You're missing the point, Eddie.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.808
Maybe you're all just overworked.

03:34.138 --> 03:35.562
You're always in the hospital.

03:35.564 --> 03:37.879
I mean, if I leave here, I'll die.

03:37.881 --> 03:39.581
What's your excuse?

03:39.583 --> 03:42.149
Yeah. You know what, Eddie?

03:42.151 --> 03:44.119
You're exactly right.

03:44.121 --> 03:45.820
We all have tonight off.

03:45.822 --> 03:47.289
Maybe we should go out together.

03:47.291 --> 03:50.291
Well, Lexie can't because she
has her stand-up show tonight.

03:50.293 --> 03:53.761
What? Since when is
Lexie doing stand-up?

03:53.763 --> 03:57.766
Shoot. I wasn't supposed
to tell anybody that.

03:57.768 --> 04:00.000
I am the worst at keeping secrets.

04:00.253 --> 04:01.835
But people love to tell me stuff.

04:01.837 --> 04:04.339
I just have one of those faces.

04:04.341 --> 04:08.320
Huh. That would explain why
she was a sourpuss this morning.

04:08.322 --> 04:09.467
She's nervous.

04:09.469 --> 04:12.347
Oh, she's terrified. This
is her first open mic night.

04:12.349 --> 04:13.438
Oh, this is perfect.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.123
I'm gonna get everyone
to go and watch her.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.886
We will bond as a group
while supporting our friend.

04:17.887 --> 04:19.853
Man, I'm a good core.

04:19.856 --> 04:21.726
Styrofoam!

04:22.993 --> 04:25.160
The silver lining of
falling out of a treehouse

04:25.162 --> 04:27.028
is that my son uploaded it to YouTube.

04:27.030 --> 04:30.364
The comments are mean,
but I like the attention.

04:30.366 --> 04:33.343
Well, you fractured your tibia

04:33.345 --> 04:35.235
and fibula, so you're gonna be in a cast

04:35.237 --> 04:36.338
for six to eight weeks.

04:36.460 --> 04:37.581
That long?

04:37.583 --> 04:38.913
I got three little boys.

04:38.915 --> 04:40.848
Plus, I'm a crossing
guard at a middle school.

04:41.111 --> 04:42.744
I can't go to work on crutches.

04:42.746 --> 04:45.179
Those kids will eat me alive.

04:45.181 --> 04:47.114
Oh, don't worry. We've submitted
your claim to insurance,

04:47.116 --> 04:48.639
so soon, you'll be swinging babies

04:48.641 --> 04:49.850
in a brand-new wheelchair.

04:49.852 --> 04:51.386
Dr. Sommers.

04:51.388 --> 04:52.924
A word?

04:56.674 --> 04:59.510
Dr. Sommers, Deidre isn't
getting a wheelchair.

04:59.837 --> 05:01.295
Her insurance rejected the claim.

05:01.297 --> 05:03.131
They approved her for crutches.

05:03.133 --> 05:06.030
Crutches? With three kids and
working as a crossing guard?

05:06.032 --> 05:07.802
I mean, we might as well
break her other leg now,

05:07.804 --> 05:09.004
'cause it's gonna happen.

05:09.006 --> 05:11.529
This is what insurance companies do.

05:11.531 --> 05:13.374
They approve the option that's cheapest

05:13.376 --> 05:15.710
rather than the option
that's best for the patient.

05:15.712 --> 05:18.013
I've battled the insurance
companies many times.

05:18.015 --> 05:19.382
You never get what you want.

05:19.384 --> 05:21.889
I find that people respond to kindness.

05:21.891 --> 05:23.523
Yeah, so maybe all I need to do is

05:23.525 --> 05:25.548
put a little bit of sugar on it.

05:25.550 --> 05:27.739
Oh, I see.

05:27.741 --> 05:29.691
The insurance companies
would approve everything

05:29.693 --> 05:31.126
if I was friendlier.

05:31.128 --> 05:32.960
Well, watch out, insurance companies.

05:32.962 --> 05:35.129
Here comes Dr. Sommers and his sugar.

05:35.131 --> 05:38.867
Yeah. You're learning, and
that's what's important.

05:38.869 --> 05:40.938
(SINGS QUIETLY)

05:42.905 --> 05:44.838
Lexie's doing stand-up?

05:44.840 --> 05:47.408
Yes. And, you know, we've
been kind of a mess lately,

05:47.410 --> 05:50.145
so I'm putting together a
secret group bonding trip

05:50.147 --> 05:51.546
to go support her.

05:51.548 --> 05:53.137
- Pass.
- (SCOFFS)

05:53.139 --> 05:55.061
Dennis, it won't be
the same without you.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.797
You are the core of this group.

05:57.953 --> 06:00.088
That is true, huh?

06:00.090 --> 06:01.980
- I'm in.
- Yes.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.516
And we could use the hang time.

06:03.518 --> 06:05.374
Stand-up makes me uncomfortable.

06:05.376 --> 06:07.399
Daniel, it won't be
the same without you.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.093
You're the core of this group.

06:10.095 --> 06:12.551
That is true.

06:12.553 --> 06:14.643
I'm in.

06:14.645 --> 06:16.734
And you know, you <i> are</i>
the core of this group.

06:16.736 --> 06:18.992
- No, I'm not.
- I know, but you should come anyway.

06:18.994 --> 06:20.598
Okay, I'm in.

06:22.145 --> 06:24.311
I'm on the phone with
Tanya from insurance,

06:24.313 --> 06:25.946
and she's delightful.

06:25.948 --> 06:27.640
You might think your sugar is working,

06:27.642 --> 06:29.766
but I'm gonna tell you
exactly what's gonna happen.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.657
You'll be bounced around from rep to rep

06:31.659 --> 06:35.117
and then placed on a brief
hold that will never, ever end.

06:35.119 --> 06:36.555
No, that's not gonna happen.

06:36.557 --> 06:39.126
We're vibing, and I'm
gonna get that wheelchair.

06:39.128 --> 06:40.929
Observe.

06:40.931 --> 06:44.465
All right, Tan Tan, let's get
to the next steps, shall we?

06:44.467 --> 06:48.035
How do we get our girl Deidre
into a shiny new wheelchair?

06:48.037 --> 06:49.970
TANYA: Oh, that's gonna be easy as pie.

06:49.972 --> 06:52.040
I'm guessing she needs
to talk to a supervisor.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.780
I do need to talk to a supervisor.

06:53.782 --> 06:55.443
Probably to go over logistics.

06:55.445 --> 06:57.011
Just to go over some logistics.

06:57.013 --> 06:58.746
And in order to do that...

06:58.748 --> 06:59.948
Wait for it.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.862
... I will need to put
you on a brief hold.

07:01.864 --> 07:04.919
Oh, no, no. Maybe we could
just keep me on that... (GROANS)

07:04.921 --> 07:06.924
(SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

07:08.469 --> 07:11.393
Whatever. I could listen
to smooth jazz forever.

07:11.395 --> 07:12.885
(LAUGHS)

07:12.887 --> 07:15.357
Then you're in luck because you will.

07:18.782 --> 07:21.538
(LIVELY CHATTER)

07:21.540 --> 07:25.098
(WHOOPS) Isn't this fun,
hanging out as a group?

07:25.100 --> 07:27.190
I think the last time
I was in a comedy club,

07:27.192 --> 07:28.519
I was dating your dad.

07:28.521 --> 07:30.988
Mm, looks like the joke's on me.

07:31.381 --> 07:33.381
Hey, you think I should go up there?

07:33.383 --> 07:35.152
- No, Mom. Let's sit down.
- Okay.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.546
Hey, I didn't know
you invited Dr. Frost.

07:38.548 --> 07:39.603
I didn't.

07:39.605 --> 07:42.139
Well, either someone brought
in a Brooks Brothers mannequin,

07:42.141 --> 07:43.675
or it's him.

07:43.994 --> 07:45.927
Dr. Frost?

07:45.929 --> 07:47.754
- Oh, Dr. Kenney.
- What are you doing here?

07:47.756 --> 07:49.824
Well, I enjoy amateur comedy.

07:50.142 --> 07:52.400
Reminds me that laughter
is the best medicine.

07:52.402 --> 07:53.946
- Yeah.
- Except for morphine.

07:53.948 --> 07:56.839
You can't beat morphine. (LAUGHS)

07:56.841 --> 07:59.931
Just give up, man. You've
been on hold for hours.

07:59.933 --> 08:01.501
No, it's for a good cause.

08:01.503 --> 08:03.906
Plus, I think the phone
is fused to my face.

08:06.126 --> 08:07.649
Oh, you're here.

08:07.651 --> 08:09.641
Yeah, I'm the core of the group.

08:09.643 --> 08:12.900
Hey, I thought you said <i>
I</i> was the core of the group.

08:12.902 --> 08:15.992
It doesn't matter if the core
is you or Daniel or clearly me.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.784
(STAMMERS) Tonight is about

08:17.786 --> 08:19.593
coming together and supporting Lexie.

08:19.595 --> 08:21.328
- Look, anyway, show's starting.
- (MUSIC BEGINS, CHEERING)

08:21.330 --> 08:22.821
Dr. Frost, why don't you join us?

08:22.823 --> 08:25.665
Oh, thank you. I love to
laugh, but laughing with others?

08:25.667 --> 08:27.067
Now, that's a real gift. (CHUCKLES)

08:27.750 --> 08:29.642
What's up, party people?

08:29.644 --> 08:30.938
(WHOOPS)

08:30.940 --> 08:32.831
Ha-ha! She's good.

08:32.832 --> 08:34.866
Let me remind you,
it's a two-drink minimum

08:34.868 --> 08:37.823
to see the show and a
six-drink minimum to enjoy it.

08:37.826 --> 08:39.159
(LAUGHTER)

08:39.515 --> 08:41.607
Dude, turn off your phone.

08:41.610 --> 08:45.085
I can't. I got to go, but
remember all the jokes.

08:45.087 --> 08:48.192
The thing I love most about
comedy is hearing it secondhand.

08:49.881 --> 08:51.370
Get ready for some funny.

08:51.372 --> 08:53.974
Please give a warm
welcome to Lexie Gilani!

08:54.164 --> 08:55.462
(CHEERING)

08:55.464 --> 08:57.197
FROST: Hang on.

08:57.199 --> 09:00.000
I think that's Dr. Gilani.

09:00.002 --> 09:02.103
Hey, everyone.

09:02.105 --> 09:04.172
(CHUCKLES): Ooh. Bright.

09:04.174 --> 09:07.008
Uh, I've actually
never done this before,

09:07.010 --> 09:09.961
but, uh, I realized I needed an outlet

09:09.963 --> 09:13.055
when I got so stressed at
work, I stole a therapy dog.

09:13.057 --> 09:14.479
(LAUGHTER)

09:14.481 --> 09:17.072
Now that dog's in therapy.

09:17.074 --> 09:20.532
Which is probably a good thing,
'cause his mom's a total bitch.

09:20.534 --> 09:22.813
(LAUGHTER)

09:22.815 --> 09:25.938
See, I'm a doctor, and I
work with a bunch of lunatics.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.998
Oh, she's gonna roast us.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.810
The head guy,

09:29.812 --> 09:32.723
Dr. Frost... he's old and brittle.

09:32.725 --> 09:34.782
Every time he talks,
I keep thinking about

09:34.784 --> 09:37.178
how easy it would be to kidnap him.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.169
(LAUGHS): Yeah, it would be.

09:39.171 --> 09:40.668
(LAUGHTER)

09:40.670 --> 09:42.692
Although, when I'm talking,
she should really be listening.

09:42.694 --> 09:43.851
Yeah.

09:43.853 --> 09:46.660
And then there's Nurse
Dennis at the front desk.

09:46.662 --> 09:50.553
Uh, he's like if Eeyore was
a six-foot-five black dude.

09:50.555 --> 09:53.489
(LAUGHS) Spot-on.

09:53.491 --> 09:56.581
Eeyore's the sexy one, right?

09:56.583 --> 09:59.040
And then there's this
old lady doctor Carol.

09:59.042 --> 10:01.565
I guess I didn't need
to say she was old.

10:01.567 --> 10:04.471
No one's named their kid "Carol"
since the Great Depression.

10:05.575 --> 10:08.823
Ah, then there's always
the cocky, hot doctor.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.324
He thinks he's God's gift to women.

10:11.326 --> 10:13.715
Guilty as charged.

10:13.717 --> 10:15.607
But if that's the best God can do,

10:15.609 --> 10:17.098
he's not invited to my birthday.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.557
(LAUGHTER)

10:19.559 --> 10:22.082
Bring a receipt, God! (LAUGHS)

10:22.084 --> 10:23.741
'Cause I'd return him.

10:23.743 --> 10:27.257
- (LAUGHTER)
- Uh, so there's this pharma rep.

10:27.259 --> 10:28.643
Uh, she's pretty hot.

10:28.645 --> 10:30.645
I'd give her, like, a 8.5.

10:30.647 --> 10:33.014
Like, out of eight?

10:33.016 --> 10:34.852
Ooh, ya burnt.

10:35.953 --> 10:37.642
And to add to the craziness,

10:37.644 --> 10:40.855
Hottie Point Five and
God's Gift were dating.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.057
(LAUGHS)

10:42.059 --> 10:44.129
That's a good one. Wait, what?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.031
Jenny and Daniel?

10:50.847 --> 10:52.312
Mom? Mom, are you good?

10:52.314 --> 10:53.914
Are you ever gonna talk again?

10:53.916 --> 10:56.786
Jennifer, you know I don't
like to make a scene in public.

10:58.154 --> 11:01.254
I can't believe you dated Daniel
and you never told me about it!

11:01.256 --> 11:04.725
Mom, it wasn't that big of
a deal. It was just one dinner.

11:04.727 --> 11:06.994
And Daniel didn't even wait
for the food to come out.

11:06.996 --> 11:08.773
(CHUCKLES): That's not the whole story.

11:08.775 --> 11:11.433
That is exactly the whole story.

11:11.435 --> 11:13.467
You knew, too?

11:13.469 --> 11:16.169
Okay, well, I guess maybe
my only real friend here

11:16.171 --> 11:17.404
is Dr. Frost.

11:17.406 --> 11:20.343
Well, I must admit I also knew.

11:21.745 --> 11:23.378
I actually went on the date with them.

11:23.380 --> 11:24.479
What?!

11:24.481 --> 11:25.846
Oh, it's not what you think.

11:25.848 --> 11:27.047
It wasn't a double date.

11:27.049 --> 11:30.087
It was just me and them.

11:31.353 --> 11:32.889
Okay. Good night.

11:35.344 --> 11:37.332
Oh, my God, I have been such a fool.

11:37.334 --> 11:39.531
I thought I was the one
bringing the group together.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.364
Turns out the group <i> has</i> been together,

11:41.366 --> 11:43.431
keeping a secret from me. How fun.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.398
Carol, it wasn't a secret.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.439
It was something that I was told
specifically not to tell you.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.376
Mom, don't blame them. This is on me.

11:53.378 --> 11:55.184
I just didn't know how you'd react

11:55.186 --> 11:57.219
if you knew that I went out with Daniel.

11:57.221 --> 11:59.345
This is how I would react.

11:59.347 --> 12:00.682
Are you crazy?!

12:02.018 --> 12:04.368
Daniel?! There's so many reasons

12:04.370 --> 12:06.085
why going out with him is a bad idea.

12:06.087 --> 12:08.154
He is my coworker. He's your coworker.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.094
Plus, he's vain and insecure.

12:11.096 --> 12:13.667
If I'm vain, then how can
I be insecure? (CHUCKLES)

12:14.767 --> 12:19.230
Oh, no. Did you guys all just get here?

12:19.232 --> 12:20.684
I just wandered in myself.

12:20.686 --> 12:23.623
We saw your show, Lexie,
and we're not happy.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.984
Lexie, you were better than that
girl who played the tambourine.

12:37.322 --> 12:39.422
I'd have to say my
favorite joke of yours

12:39.424 --> 12:41.190
was the one about kidnapping Dr. Frost.

12:41.192 --> 12:44.127
That or the one that made
my mom stop speaking to me.

12:44.129 --> 12:45.329
I can't decide.

12:45.331 --> 12:48.346
Again, I didn't invite any of you.

12:48.348 --> 12:49.605
If I'd known you were gonna be there,

12:49.607 --> 12:52.010
I would've played it safe
with my Muslim lesbian stuff.

12:53.137 --> 12:54.137
Oh. Wait.

12:54.139 --> 12:55.238
- There's my mom.
- Mm.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.773
- She looks less mad, right?
- Totally. Carol!

12:57.775 --> 12:59.044
- Over here!
- Mom.

13:00.130 --> 13:01.531
Hey, friend!

13:01.533 --> 13:03.465
JAKE: OMG.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.602
It's happening. Be cool.

13:05.604 --> 13:07.469
JENNY: Oh, God.

13:07.471 --> 13:08.927
She's gonna do that
thing where she pretends

13:08.929 --> 13:10.506
to be better friends with someone else.

13:10.508 --> 13:12.474
I know she's just trying
to make us feel bad,

13:12.476 --> 13:15.011
but it <i> is</i> making me feel bad!

13:15.013 --> 13:16.345
Hi, Jake.

13:16.347 --> 13:20.382
Hey, do you know anything
about Daniel and Jenny?

13:20.384 --> 13:22.453
Oh, no. What happened?
Did their Crohn's flare up?

13:23.654 --> 13:26.021
What? No.

13:26.023 --> 13:28.891
Oh. I only guessed that
'cause my Crohn's flared up.

13:28.893 --> 13:30.459
Oh.

13:30.461 --> 13:34.161
Well, I guess we're
the last to know, hmm?

13:34.163 --> 13:36.132
Know what?

13:36.134 --> 13:37.566
(LAUGHING)

13:37.568 --> 13:39.456
(BOTH LAUGHING)

13:40.071 --> 13:42.505
- Wow, he's really making her laugh.
- CAROL: Oh, my God.

13:42.507 --> 13:45.909
Weird. I thought he'd just
talk about his Crohn's again.

13:45.911 --> 13:47.042
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

13:47.044 --> 13:48.978
Yeah. I guess it is kind of funny

13:48.980 --> 13:50.979
that my digestive tract
makes such loud noises.

13:50.981 --> 13:52.247
(CAROL LAUGHING LOUDLY)

13:52.249 --> 13:53.650
JAKE (LAUGHING): Thank you, Carol.

13:53.652 --> 13:56.286
You've given me a whole new
perspective on my illness.

13:56.288 --> 13:57.686
- Mm.
- Thank you.

13:57.688 --> 13:59.891
(MELLOW INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING OVER PHONE)

14:03.928 --> 14:06.329
Wh-Why is your phone in a plastic bag?

14:06.331 --> 14:09.564
Well, I had to shower with it.

14:09.566 --> 14:10.828
You had to?

14:10.830 --> 14:12.568
RECORDED VOICE: Your
call is important to us.

14:12.570 --> 14:16.171
Oh, don't lie to me,
you heartless robot!

14:16.173 --> 14:18.608
Come on, pick up, you coward!

14:18.610 --> 14:20.410
RECORDED VOICE: We
appreciate your patience.

14:20.412 --> 14:22.178
You are the next caller in the queue.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.414
(PANTING): Oh, my God.
I'm the next caller.

14:24.416 --> 14:25.614
Oh, I'm almost there.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.650
Ooh, I can taste that wheelchair.

14:27.652 --> 14:29.252
(PHONE BEEPS, MUSIC STOPS)

14:29.254 --> 14:31.186
Uh... oh, my battery.

14:31.188 --> 14:34.424
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't have my charger on me.

14:34.426 --> 14:37.627
Do you have a charger for a flip phone?

14:37.629 --> 14:40.496
Do you have a needle
for my record player?

14:40.498 --> 14:42.598
Come on, man, I'm not that old.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.334
No, you're not.

14:44.336 --> 14:46.169
But you know who <i> is</i> old?

14:46.171 --> 14:48.007
Old people.

14:49.606 --> 14:51.306
(GRUNTS)

14:51.308 --> 14:54.112
Geriatrics, I need your
lost and found, stat!

14:56.514 --> 14:57.680
Oh, yes.

14:57.682 --> 14:59.748
Charger. I'm saved.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.718
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.089
That's so good to hear.

15:06.270 --> 15:08.026
So there's no sign of
bacteria in the cultures

15:08.028 --> 15:10.994
from your paracentesis, and
your bilirubin has improved.

15:11.428 --> 15:15.064
In other news, Eddie,
I'm a lone wolf now.

15:15.066 --> 15:18.133
I ride solo, just like you.

15:18.135 --> 15:20.371
I'm actually very popular.

15:21.515 --> 15:24.037
Is this about Daniel and Jenny dating?

15:24.039 --> 15:26.030
They told you, too?! Okay...

15:26.032 --> 15:27.497
Shoot. I did it again.

15:27.711 --> 15:30.445
I got to get people to
stop telling me secrets.

15:30.447 --> 15:33.082
Love hearing 'em. Can't keep 'em in.

15:33.084 --> 15:35.584
Okay, here I thought
I was the Styrofoam;

15:35.902 --> 15:37.453
turns out I'm the cellophane.

15:37.455 --> 15:39.454
First thing you throw away.

15:39.456 --> 15:41.089
You throw away the Styrofoam, too.

15:41.318 --> 15:44.490
Yeah. Why do you hate metaphors, Eddie?

15:45.764 --> 15:48.590
You know, Carol, this might
just be the perspective

15:48.592 --> 15:50.465
of a guy who lives in a hospital,

15:50.467 --> 15:52.667
but I think you're overreacting.

15:52.669 --> 15:54.337
(SIGHS) I know. It...

15:54.339 --> 15:57.406
it's just that this place
has become my whole life.

15:57.408 --> 15:59.308
I-I always thought
that I was as important

15:59.310 --> 16:01.136
to everyone else as they are to me.

16:01.138 --> 16:04.517
Knowing that I was the only one
on the outside of something...

16:04.749 --> 16:06.648
it hurts.

16:06.650 --> 16:09.242
Look, I-I told you, I'm very popular.

16:09.244 --> 16:11.044
Yes, I get that, Eddie.

16:11.332 --> 16:13.356
So I know all the hospital gossip...

16:13.358 --> 16:15.358
who's dating, who's fighting,

16:15.360 --> 16:17.392
who has a podcast about Siamese cats.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.663
Dennis.

16:19.730 --> 16:22.732
- Is that another secret?
- No. He's real proud of it.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.068
But I also hear the truth

16:25.070 --> 16:27.069
about who people like
and who they don't,

16:27.071 --> 16:29.171
and everyone in this hospital loves you.

16:29.173 --> 16:31.207
Really?

16:31.209 --> 16:33.342
Do they call me the core of the group?

16:33.344 --> 16:35.343
I don't think anyone calls anyone that.

16:35.345 --> 16:36.369
Yeah.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.303
But I do know you're
very important to them.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.650
(SIGHS) Thank you, Eddie.

16:40.652 --> 16:42.819
This really makes me feel better.

16:42.821 --> 16:44.252
I'm glad.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.308
Oh. Uh, not to ruin this moment,

16:46.310 --> 16:48.223
but Bad News Jake loved your lunch.

16:48.225 --> 16:49.724
He's gonna ask you to be his plus-one

16:49.726 --> 16:50.726
at his cousin's wedding.

16:50.728 --> 16:52.527
(SIGHS)

16:52.529 --> 16:54.354
I hope it's not a destination wedding.

16:54.356 --> 16:56.456
You know, he used to have
a crush on his cousin.

16:56.993 --> 16:59.471
Dang it! I did it again!

17:00.860 --> 17:04.553
Oh! This is fantastic!

17:04.555 --> 17:07.609
I can move. I can go to work.

17:07.612 --> 17:10.036
- I can chase my sons.
- (LAUGHS)

17:10.038 --> 17:12.281
Right, it's still gonna
be a tough recovery,

17:12.282 --> 17:14.193
but hopefully this'll help.

17:14.194 --> 17:15.426
- Now, give it a whirl!
- Okay.

17:15.853 --> 17:17.603
Ooh, watch out.

17:17.605 --> 17:20.030
Too fast, too furious.

17:20.031 --> 17:21.853
(LAUGHS)

17:21.855 --> 17:24.253
I can't believe insurance agreed to pay

17:24.256 --> 17:27.175
for an even nicer wheelchair
than the one we requested.

17:27.178 --> 17:29.902
Yeah. I mean, uh, you know,
it just, it just goes to show

17:29.904 --> 17:32.400
that behind all the
bureaucracy and red tape,

17:32.402 --> 17:34.837
an insurance company is just
a collection of human beings...

17:34.839 --> 17:36.304
I know you paid for it.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.707
The insurance company's
full of monsters.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.775
Tanya's a demon. The
system doesn't work!

17:40.777 --> 17:42.477
(SIGHS)

17:42.479 --> 17:44.842
So, Dr. Sommers, what's your plan?

17:44.844 --> 17:46.975
To pay for every
patient insurance won't?

17:46.977 --> 17:48.433
Yeah. That was my plan.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.291
And to get emotionally invested.

17:50.293 --> 17:53.262
I appreciate your instincts.

17:53.658 --> 17:55.226
It's admirable.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.413
Really?

17:57.415 --> 17:59.138
You're not mad?

17:59.140 --> 18:01.006
No. I...

18:01.408 --> 18:03.765
I once paid for a patient's insulin pump

18:03.767 --> 18:05.286
after insurance denied it.

18:05.288 --> 18:06.836
When I can help, I do.

18:06.838 --> 18:08.165
But it's not sustainable.

18:08.167 --> 18:10.266
One person can't pay for everything.

18:10.574 --> 18:13.017
I hear you, but I have a trust fund,

18:13.019 --> 18:16.458
live in a one-bedroom apartment,
and I mostly eat beans.

18:19.322 --> 18:21.993
Well, then, buy all the
wheelchairs you want.

18:25.794 --> 18:27.051
Hey.

18:27.053 --> 18:28.275
Hey.

18:28.277 --> 18:29.375
How you holding up?

18:29.377 --> 18:30.893
(SIGHS) Not great.

18:30.895 --> 18:32.794
My mom's furious at me.

18:32.796 --> 18:34.629
Yeah, no kidding. Me, too.

18:34.631 --> 18:36.432
I'm sorry.

18:36.434 --> 18:37.800
And over nothing.

18:37.802 --> 18:38.967
Less than nothing.

18:38.969 --> 18:40.578
I mean, we agreed not to date.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.472
- It's the wrong time.
- The wrongest.

18:42.474 --> 18:43.656
Even if we really wanted to.

18:43.657 --> 18:44.850
- Which we don't.
- Not at all.

18:44.851 --> 18:46.777
- It's ridiculous.
- Never gonna happen!

18:54.686 --> 18:55.952
Hey.

18:55.954 --> 18:57.157
Hey.

18:57.159 --> 18:59.414
Does this mean you're
speaking to us again?

18:59.416 --> 19:01.473
I may have overreacted a little.

19:01.475 --> 19:02.731
Okay, a lot.

19:02.733 --> 19:04.122
I don't know.

19:04.124 --> 19:05.780
If I heard Daniel was
dating my daughter,

19:05.782 --> 19:07.537
I'd fly into a blind rage, too.

19:07.539 --> 19:10.474
I know, but it wasn't that.

19:10.669 --> 19:12.759
It was hearing that you guys
were keeping something from me.

19:12.761 --> 19:14.407
It just made me feel left out.

19:14.409 --> 19:16.555
I'm sorry. It was a hard choice:

19:16.557 --> 19:19.841
keeping Daniel and Jenny's
secret or being open with you.

19:19.843 --> 19:21.519
If it was just Daniel's secret,

19:21.521 --> 19:23.023
we would've told you immediately.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.264
That's okay. I should apologize to you.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.922
I mean, I learned a lot today,

19:27.924 --> 19:29.658
but the most important thing I learned

19:30.021 --> 19:32.324
- was that you guys love me.
- LEXIE: Mm.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.463
That is an odd apology.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.522
And I want you guys to know...

19:38.524 --> 19:40.858
I love you, too.

19:41.299 --> 19:43.969
- Oh.
- Ooh. I hope there's hard pineapple.

19:44.718 --> 19:46.742
Next time we have a night off,

19:46.744 --> 19:48.232
let's all just grab a drink together.

19:48.234 --> 19:50.458
Yes, and we can invite Daniel <i> and</i> Jenny.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.647
Aw. That's big of you.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.520
And thank goodness
they didn't get together, right?

19:53.522 --> 19:55.111
I would have to change careers again.

19:55.113 --> 19:56.582
(CHUCKLING)

19:58.171 --> 19:59.405
This is gonna be amazing,

19:59.407 --> 20:01.042
in that it's going to be terrible.

20:01.044 --> 20:02.580
(CHUCKLES) I can't wait.

20:02.582 --> 20:04.819
All right, remember, be supportive.

20:06.076 --> 20:09.934
Okay, uh, first, I'd
like to thank Dr. Gilani

20:09.936 --> 20:11.202
for inspiring me.

20:11.393 --> 20:13.149
This is my first time,

20:13.151 --> 20:15.374
so I'll admit I'm a little nervous.

20:15.376 --> 20:17.289
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:17.291 --> 20:19.325
Here goes nothing.

20:19.327 --> 20:21.393
What's the deal with airline travel?

20:21.395 --> 20:23.102
Am I right?

20:23.104 --> 20:26.060
Sometimes those towels
in first class are so hot

20:26.062 --> 20:28.430
you can barely use
them to open your pores!

20:28.636 --> 20:30.168
(LAUGHS)

20:30.170 --> 20:32.341
And if you're gonna be
out of sweet vermouth,

20:32.343 --> 20:36.341
maybe don't call the Manhattan
your "signature cocktail".

20:36.343 --> 20:39.444
Huh? Am I correct in this assumption?

20:39.446 --> 20:41.325
MAN: What are you talking about?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.430
Your mom. (CHUCKLES)
