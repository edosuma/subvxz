01:12.197 --> 01:14.282
You go straight to your

01:12.197 --> 01:14.282
job after school today.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.910
I don't want

01:14.324 --> 01:15.910
you to be late

01:15.951 --> 01:18.037
for your first day of work,

01:15.951 --> 01:18.037
and no excuses.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.748
I don't want to hear

01:18.078 --> 01:20.748
a lion escaped from the zoo.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.417
Or the bus driver went insane

01:20.789 --> 01:23.417
and refused to stop.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.335
Francis' friend,

01:23.458 --> 01:25.335
Richie, gave Reese

01:25.377 --> 01:26.962
a job at the Circus Burger.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.129
It's perfect.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.131
Reese gets to be

01:28.171 --> 01:30.131
bossed around all day

01:30.173 --> 01:32.133
by the only guy

01:30.173 --> 01:32.133
on the entire planet

01:32.175 --> 01:34.428
that's dumber than he is.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.804
This job is stupid.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.180
Well, you do get

01:35.846 --> 01:37.180
to wear a paper hat.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.558
Reese, you want to drive

01:37.222 --> 01:39.558
when you get your license,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.393
you're going to pay

01:39.600 --> 01:41.393
for your own insurance.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.938
Yeah, but if everyone

01:41.435 --> 01:43.938
else has insurance,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.938
then why do I need it?

01:43.979 --> 01:45.022
They've got it covered.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.941
Son, it's not

01:45.064 --> 01:46.941
as simple as that.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.192
You see...

01:50.193 --> 01:52.153
Good morning, everybody.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.155
Say good morning, Charlie.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.617
Show everyone how alive you are.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.744
My parents made

01:56.658 --> 01:58.744
a deal with Dewey.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.204
If he keeps his goldfish

01:58.786 --> 02:01.204
alive for two months,

02:01.246 --> 02:02.664
he gets a dog.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.165
Aren't I doing a good job?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.626
You sure are.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.169
How is that fish

02:06.585 --> 02:08.169
still alive?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.170
I don't know.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.171
He never feeds it.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.173
He leaves it out

02:10.213 --> 02:12.173
in the sun for hours.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.426
Last week, there was an old

02:12.215 --> 02:14.426
banana peel in there.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.177
I do not want a dog

02:14.468 --> 02:16.177
in this house.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.055
Well, as long as

02:16.219 --> 02:18.055
this fish is alive

02:18.097 --> 02:19.222
there's nothing

02:18.097 --> 02:19.222
we can do about it.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.058
Hal, I expect you

02:19.264 --> 02:21.058
to take care of this.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.184
What are you suggesting?

02:23.226 --> 02:25.104
I'm not suggesting

02:23.226 --> 02:25.104
anything.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.689
I just want it

02:25.145 --> 02:27.689
taken care of.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.611
Class, today we begin

02:30.067 --> 02:32.611
a new round

02:32.653 --> 02:34.655
of independent

02:32.653 --> 02:34.655
study projects.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.075
Hydrostatic Equilibrium.

02:38.117 --> 02:41.620
My God, I'm still mired in

02:38.117 --> 02:41.620
path integral quantization.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.123
My stepdad's right,

02:41.662 --> 02:44.123
I'm useless.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.207
Well, the cold hard

02:44.164 --> 02:46.207
fact of life is

02:46.249 --> 02:48.251
some are more advanced

02:46.249 --> 02:48.251
than others.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.212
Some even think they are more

02:48.293 --> 02:51.212
advanced than me.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.380
I never said that.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.842
And yet you assume I'm talking

02:52.422 --> 02:54.842
about you.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.217
You're looking right at me.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.803
I'm sure you're

02:56.259 --> 02:57.803
all convinced

02:57.845 --> 03:00.097
that by virtue of your

02:57.845 --> 03:00.097
being in this class

03:00.139 --> 03:03.017
your intellects tower above

03:00.139 --> 03:03.017
those of the tiny-minded

03:03.058 --> 03:05.686
plebeians wasting oxygen

03:03.058 --> 03:05.686
in the rest of the school.

03:05.727 --> 03:11.316
But to some, you are nothing

03:05.727 --> 03:11.316
more than howling primates.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.276
I am very excited

03:11.358 --> 03:13.276
to announce today

03:13.318 --> 03:16.237
that we are welcoming

03:13.318 --> 03:16.237
to our class a new student.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.616
A young man

03:16.279 --> 03:19.616
of unparalleled intellect.

03:19.658 --> 03:23.704
As near as we can measure,

03:19.658 --> 03:23.704
his IQ is over 280.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.874
(gasps)

03:23.745 --> 03:26.874
Those tests are

03:23.745 --> 03:26.874
culturally biased.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.125
Think what you will.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.460
Your petty fears

03:28.167 --> 03:30.460
no longer concern me.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.420
I finally have

03:30.502 --> 03:32.420
the mental clay

03:32.462 --> 03:33.964
worthy of my sculpting.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.550
Barton is a white-hot

03:34.006 --> 03:36.550
comet of brilliance

03:36.591 --> 03:39.970
blazing through our dark

03:36.591 --> 03:39.970
little corner of ignorance.

03:40.012 --> 03:43.348
A mind of such unfathomable

03:40.012 --> 03:43.348
reach and enormous power.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.851
Can I come in now?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.311
Barton, I thought I told you

03:45.893 --> 03:48.311
to wait until you heard

03:48.353 --> 03:49.938
"a new era for man."

03:49.980 --> 03:52.774
But there's a bee out there.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.943
REESE:

03:53.775 --> 03:54.943
So, assistant manager.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.111
How'd that happen?

03:56.153 --> 03:57.779
INS raid cleaned us out.

03:57.821 --> 04:01.324
So, from 12:00 to 5:00,

03:57.821 --> 04:01.324
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday

04:01.366 --> 04:03.077
this is my domain.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.579
I'm proof you don't

04:03.118 --> 04:05.579
really need to graduate

04:05.620 --> 04:06.955
from high school.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.207
That's just propaganda

04:08.248 --> 04:10.542
from those money-grubbing

04:08.248 --> 04:10.542
diploma companies.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.211
Sean, Doug, this is Reese.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.294
Hey.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.294
Hey, what's up?

04:13.336 --> 04:14.337
Hey.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.297
RICHIE:

04:14.379 --> 04:16.297
Okay, press cow for burger,

04:16.339 --> 04:17.591
potato for fries,

04:17.632 --> 04:19.300
and I'm not sure

04:17.632 --> 04:19.300
what this is.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.970
Does that look like

04:19.342 --> 04:21.970
a pig or a dog to you?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.472
Wouldn't it be easier

04:22.012 --> 04:24.472
to put words on the keys?

04:24.514 --> 04:26.307
Ah, a man of letters.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.726
A word to the wise--

04:27.768 --> 04:30.771
I wouldn't throw that

04:27.768 --> 04:30.771
in anyone's face.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.606
(cash register rings)

04:30.812 --> 04:32.606
Once you got your total,

04:32.647 --> 04:34.524
you put the money

04:32.647 --> 04:34.524
in the drawer.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.317
Except if you're making

04:34.566 --> 04:36.317
a pocket transaction.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.319
What's that?

04:36.359 --> 04:38.319
It's kind of a morale builder.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.405
Once in a while,

04:38.361 --> 04:40.405
you take five or ten bucks.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.489
But you don't ring it up,

04:41.531 --> 04:43.784
you put it in your

04:41.531 --> 04:43.784
pocket instead.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.286
You don't have a problem

04:43.825 --> 04:46.286
with that, do you?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.164
Oh, no, that's cool.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.165
See, Reese?

04:50.207 --> 04:52.584
You've entered

04:50.207 --> 04:52.584
the working world.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.629
The world of adult

04:52.626 --> 04:55.629
responsibility.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.219
I have the key

05:00.300 --> 05:02.219
to her locker.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.345
You want to smell

05:02.261 --> 05:04.345
her jacket later,

05:04.387 --> 05:05.806
just let me know.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.724
Hey, they found

05:05.847 --> 05:07.724
the last piece of that guy.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.810
Oh, man.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.519
Come on, guys,

05:09.851 --> 05:11.519
we talked about this.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.605
If we're going share

05:11.561 --> 05:13.605
a roll of toilet paper,

05:13.647 --> 05:15.523
can we at least keep it

05:13.647 --> 05:15.523
on the spindle?

05:15.565 --> 05:18.359
As long as you're bringing

05:15.565 --> 05:18.359
this kind of stuff up,

05:18.401 --> 05:20.070
I got a fiancée

05:18.401 --> 05:20.070
coming Thursday.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.072
Fiancée? What are

05:20.112 --> 05:22.072
you talking about?

05:22.114 --> 05:23.364
I'm engaged.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.826
There comes a time when a man

05:23.406 --> 05:25.826
gets tired of playing the field.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.785
What field?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.078
You don't even know any women.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.370
That occurred to me, too.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
That's why I ordered one

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
from Russia.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.582
A mail-order bride?

05:32.624 --> 05:34.168
That actually exists?

05:34.209 --> 05:36.211
Sure. In some of the more

05:34.209 --> 05:36.211
irradiated parts

05:36.253 --> 05:37.796
of the former Soviet Union,

05:37.838 --> 05:39.631
there are a lot of

05:37.838 --> 05:39.631
marriage-minded women.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.092
That's my darling,

05:39.673 --> 05:42.092
Svetlana.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.593
Wait a second.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.846
Yup.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.265
Svetlana.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.601
How come you're

05:49.308 --> 05:51.601
driving us to school?

05:51.643 --> 05:54.146
Because that's what

05:51.643 --> 05:54.146
mamas do sometimes.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.525
(mouthing words)

06:14.457 --> 06:16.960
(vacuum whirring)

06:19.462 --> 06:21.131
(screams)

06:21.173 --> 06:22.841
BOY:

06:21.173 --> 06:22.841
How'd you do on the test?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.718
(sighs heavily)

06:24.759 --> 06:25.886
DABNEY:

06:24.759 --> 06:25.886
Okay...

06:25.927 --> 06:28.305
you know your Tolstoy,

06:25.927 --> 06:28.305
and your Elliot.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.473
Let's see how you do

06:28.347 --> 06:30.473
with the Bard.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.895
"Every true man's apparel

06:31.766 --> 06:34.895
fits your thief."

06:34.936 --> 06:37.480
Measure for Measure,

06:34.936 --> 06:37.480
Act Four, Scene Two,

06:37.522 --> 06:38.606
Abhorson's speech to Pompey.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.275
Could you hand me

06:38.648 --> 06:40.275
my green crayon?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.236
Wow, he's

06:40.317 --> 06:42.236
right again.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.446
Okay, Barton, let's try

06:42.277 --> 06:45.446
Chaucer's  The Shipman's Tale.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.074
Should I start with

06:45.488 --> 06:47.074
the prologue?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.116
Please.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.868
How about line 203?

06:49.910 --> 06:53.288
"'And when your husband

06:49.910 --> 06:53.288
has gone off to Flanders,

06:53.330 --> 06:56.333
"I shall deliver you

06:53.330 --> 06:56.333
from fear of slanders.'

06:56.375 --> 06:58.835
"And on the word,

06:56.375 --> 06:58.835
he caught her by the flanks

06:58.877 --> 07:02.672
"and clasped her closely,

06:58.877 --> 07:02.672
giving her a riot of kisses

07:02.714 --> 07:05.508
saying softly,

07:02.714 --> 07:05.508
'Keep things quiet.'"

07:05.550 --> 07:07.426
HERKABE:

07:05.550 --> 07:07.426
What are you doing?!

07:08.929 --> 07:10.264
Chaucer?

07:10.305 --> 07:12.391
I can not believe you are

07:10.305 --> 07:12.391
polluting his mind

07:12.432 --> 07:13.975
with such

07:12.432 --> 07:13.975
pop culture drivel.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.398
I apologize for them, Barton.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.482
And I will do everything

07:19.439 --> 07:21.482
I can to minimize these

07:21.524 --> 07:24.111
annoying distractions, so

07:21.524 --> 07:24.111
that you can concentrate

07:24.152 --> 07:26.905
on the accelerated program

07:24.152 --> 07:26.905
I've laid out for you.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.491
Together, we are going

07:26.947 --> 07:30.491
to astonish the world.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.953
Would you like a Pixy Stix?

07:34.371 --> 07:35.789
Thank you.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.168
Having problems, Malcolm?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.503
No, no, not you.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.505
It's this stupid

07:42.545 --> 07:44.505
hydrostatic equilibrium.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.007
It just doesn't make any sense.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.759
Well, it is awfully difficult.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.802
But don't despair.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.511
I am here for you, Malcolm

07:50.553 --> 07:51.512
and I'll make sure

07:51.554 --> 07:53.514
that you get the help

07:51.554 --> 07:53.514
that you deserve.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.226
To estimate the pressure

07:53.556 --> 07:56.226
at the center of the sun,

07:56.268 --> 07:58.686
just assume a constant

07:56.268 --> 07:58.686
density of 1.41 grams

07:58.728 --> 08:00.230
per cubic centimeter.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.565
Am I going too fast for you?

08:02.607 --> 08:05.526
You know, Herkabe only made you

08:02.607 --> 08:05.526
my tutor to humiliate me.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.528
I thought it was

08:05.568 --> 08:07.528
to humiliate me.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.947
I don't understand

08:07.570 --> 08:08.947
why this is so hard.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.115
Don't give up.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.908
Remember the  Little Engine

08:10.157 --> 08:11.908
That Could?

08:11.950 --> 08:13.243
You're not listening!

08:13.285 --> 08:14.202
I get everything.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.495
In my entire life,

08:15.536 --> 08:17.831
there is nothing I haven't

08:15.536 --> 08:17.831
been able to master.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.916
I took algebra

08:17.872 --> 08:19.916
in sixth grade.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.168
I taught my dad

08:19.958 --> 08:21.168
how to rebuild

08:21.209 --> 08:22.543
his transmission

08:21.209 --> 08:22.543
when I was five.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.254
I was reading

08:22.585 --> 08:24.254
before I could walk.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.173
I remember my own birth.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.133
What?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.801
Do you know your heart stops

08:29.843 --> 08:32.012
during your mother's

08:29.843 --> 08:32.012
contractions?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.431
You seriously remember that?

08:34.473 --> 08:35.932
The worst was

08:34.473 --> 08:35.932
the diaper-changing.

08:35.974 --> 08:39.478
That was the most

08:35.974 --> 08:39.478
degrading week of my life.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.481
So, what's it like in there?

08:42.563 --> 08:43.773
What do you mean?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.566
Well, your brain?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.569
I mean, for me,

08:45.608 --> 08:48.569
it's like when I'm

08:45.608 --> 08:48.569
thinking really hard,

08:48.611 --> 08:50.947
my brain starts making

08:48.611 --> 08:50.947
all these connections

08:50.989 --> 08:53.574
and those connections

08:50.989 --> 08:53.574
make other connections

08:53.616 --> 08:55.743
and everything starts

08:53.616 --> 08:55.743
moving really fast

08:55.785 --> 08:57.578
and it feels like

08:55.785 --> 08:57.578
a bomb's going off.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.663
Is your brain like that?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.581
It's more like a beehive

09:00.623 --> 09:03.543
and every bee

09:00.623 --> 09:03.543
has a brain like yours.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.546
Okay, ready!

09:08.423 --> 09:09.508
That is so cool!

09:09.549 --> 09:10.591
I wish you had a gun

09:10.633 --> 09:12.802
so we could really

09:10.633 --> 09:12.802
test this thing out.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.305
CRAIG:

09:12.844 --> 09:15.305
Excuse me, could I

09:12.844 --> 09:15.305
get some help here?

09:15.347 --> 09:16.597
Hey, Craig.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.599
So, I overheard

09:16.639 --> 09:18.599
your mom talking

09:16.639 --> 09:18.599
on the phone

09:18.641 --> 09:19.851
and it's true:

09:19.893 --> 09:20.852
you've got a job.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.645
I applied here, once.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.022
Didn't get it.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.606
It's all politics.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.858
I guess.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.858
So, what do you want?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.609
I want you to listen

09:26.900 --> 09:28.609
very carefully.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.320
My blood sugar

09:28.651 --> 09:30.320
is dangerously low

09:30.362 --> 09:32.780
so I don't want to

09:30.362 --> 09:32.780
burn up any calories

09:30.362 --> 09:32.780
repeating myself.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.867
I want the Jumbo Clown Burger

09:32.822 --> 09:35.867
with the Big-top Fries,

09:35.909 --> 09:39.287
no pickles, a slice of onion,

09:35.909 --> 09:39.287
make sure it's center-cut

09:39.329 --> 09:40.621
and extra tomatoes.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.040
And let's do the patty

09:42.082 --> 09:44.709
well on one side

09:42.082 --> 09:44.709
and medium on the other.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.628
And make sure they open

09:44.751 --> 09:47.628
a fresh package for my bun.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.630
If it's stale, I bail.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.258
(chuckling)

09:51.299 --> 09:52.633
Seriously.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.261
REESE:

09:52.675 --> 09:54.261
Your total's $5.45

09:54.302 --> 09:55.678
and you get free

09:54.302 --> 09:55.678
refills on the soda.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.638
I've heard that one before.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.350
Turns out,

09:57.680 --> 10:00.350
it's just for  today.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.478
What a sack.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.688
RICHIE:

10:03.520 --> 10:05.688
That's a pocket

10:03.520 --> 10:05.688
transaction

10:05.730 --> 10:07.690
if I ever saw one.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.734
Oh.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.944
Yeah.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.613
Right.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.591
(cheering)

10:32.632 --> 10:35.676
Artie, you put together

10:32.632 --> 10:35.676
one hell of a bachelor party.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.346
I'm much obliged to you.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.723
Oh, I'm just sorry

10:38.388 --> 10:40.723
the nearest stripper

10:38.388 --> 10:40.723
is 300 miles away.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.850
Hey, how's she doing, anyway?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.978
She took her top off.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.396
ALL:

10:45.019 --> 10:46.396
Oh, yeah!

10:46.438 --> 10:47.730
(cheering)

10:47.772 --> 10:49.941
All right, all right,

10:47.772 --> 10:49.941
hey, listen up.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.694
I'd like to say a few words

10:49.983 --> 10:53.694
about my bunkmate, Pete, here

10:53.736 --> 10:56.072
on account of his

10:53.736 --> 10:56.072
upcoming nuptials.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.409
Many's the time

10:56.114 --> 10:59.409
when I've been feeling low

10:59.451 --> 11:02.703
and I  always  knew

10:59.451 --> 11:02.703
I could turn to Pete.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.498
He'd be lying there on his bunk,

11:04.539 --> 11:06.500
trimming his beard

11:04.539 --> 11:06.500
with a lighter

11:06.541 --> 11:09.002
and I'd think,

11:06.541 --> 11:09.002
"Hell, I'm better than that."

11:09.043 --> 11:10.795
To Pete, and his lucky lady.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.713
(cheering)

11:12.755 --> 11:14.007
To Pete.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.383
ALL:

11:14.048 --> 11:15.383
Yeah!

11:15.425 --> 11:16.801
What's going on with you?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.719
I just don't get

11:16.843 --> 11:18.719
what we're celebrating.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.887
I mean, it just seems wrong.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.640
It's Pete's life;

11:19.929 --> 11:21.640
if he wants to marry

11:21.680 --> 11:23.350
a total stranger,

11:21.680 --> 11:23.350
that's his business.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.726
Well, what about this woman,

11:23.391 --> 11:25.726
is anyone thinking about her?

11:25.768 --> 11:28.605
Right now, I'm trying to keep

11:25.768 --> 11:28.605
a topless stripper in my head.

11:28.647 --> 11:29.981
I don't have room

11:28.647 --> 11:29.981
for much else.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.441
Think about it

11:30.023 --> 11:31.441
for a second.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.901
She's blindly committing

11:31.483 --> 11:33.901
to spend the rest of her life

11:33.943 --> 11:36.321
in this godforsaken place

11:33.943 --> 11:36.321
with Pete as her husband.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.031
I mean, what kind

11:36.363 --> 11:38.031
of a poor creature

11:38.072 --> 11:39.824
would actually go through

11:38.072 --> 11:39.824
with this?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.326
Maybe her life's

11:39.866 --> 11:41.326
pretty awful.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.536
Worse than this?

11:42.577 --> 11:44.204
What? Does she live

11:42.577 --> 11:44.204
in a slaughterhouse?

11:44.245 --> 11:46.164
Is she dragged to work

11:44.245 --> 11:46.164
by horses every day?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.749
She couldn't possibly know

11:46.206 --> 11:48.749
what she's getting into.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.792
You're exaggerating, man.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.252
We don't know.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.546
It might work out fine.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.714
(cheering)

11:58.801 --> 12:00.637
RICHIE:

11:58.801 --> 12:00.637
Dudes, how's business?

12:00.679 --> 12:01.638
Where were you?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.348
I was supposed to

12:01.680 --> 12:03.348
be home for dinner

12:03.390 --> 12:05.559
but you're the only one

12:03.390 --> 12:05.559
who can cash me out.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.561
Hey, I'd stay

12:05.600 --> 12:07.561
on my good side

12:05.600 --> 12:07.561
if I was you.

12:07.602 --> 12:10.438
One of these days, somebody's

12:07.602 --> 12:10.438
going to have to clean out

12:10.480 --> 12:11.648
those bathrooms.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.274
Whoa, dude,

12:11.690 --> 12:13.274
this is way uncool.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.443
Reese, man, you can't take

12:13.316 --> 12:15.443
this much money.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.777
What are you

12:15.485 --> 12:16.777
talking about?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.029
Your cash drawer, man.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.780
It's over 400 bucks short.

12:19.822 --> 12:20.948
Look. The whole point is

12:20.990 --> 12:23.159
to take five or ten bucks,

12:20.990 --> 12:23.159
and that's it.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.869
You got to put the 400 back.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.787
I didn't take it, honest.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.830
Dude, it's your register.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.790
Did he give his register key

12:27.872 --> 12:29.790
to anyone today?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.459
No.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.459
Uh-uh.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.419
I didn't take it.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.712
I didn't take any.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.715
I never even did

12:33.752 --> 12:36.715
one of those stupid

12:33.752 --> 12:36.715
pocket transactions.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.466
What are you talking about?

12:36.755 --> 12:38.466
I saw you yesterday.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.802
No, I wanted it to look

12:38.508 --> 12:41.802
like I was taking it,

12:38.508 --> 12:41.802
but I didn't really.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.096
When you guys

12:41.844 --> 12:43.096
weren't looking,

12:43.137 --> 12:44.805
I put the money back.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.808
You guys didn't see it,

12:44.847 --> 12:47.808
because I was... being

12:44.847 --> 12:47.808
sneaky and stuff.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.893
Nice, Reese.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.811
Way to screw it up

12:48.935 --> 12:50.811
for everybody.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.063
I didn't take it.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.441
Look, man, if you think I'm

12:52.105 --> 12:54.441
covering for you, you're crazy.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.025
When the owner comes back

12:54.482 --> 12:56.025
tomorrow morning

12:56.067 --> 12:57.818
and checks the books,

12:56.067 --> 12:57.818
that money better be here

12:57.860 --> 12:59.696
or you're going down.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.696
(register shuts)

12:59.738 --> 13:02.031
Oh, dude.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.700
MALCOLM:

13:02.073 --> 13:03.700
All right.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.244
To change from apparent

13:03.742 --> 13:06.244
to absolute magnitude

13:03.742 --> 13:06.244
in all spectra,

13:06.286 --> 13:10.331
the formula is

13:06.286 --> 13:10.331
"A over B,

13:06.286 --> 13:10.331
times K over D."

13:10.373 --> 13:12.833
That's if K is...

13:12.875 --> 13:14.877
How do they expect

13:12.875 --> 13:14.877
you to learn all

13:12.875 --> 13:14.877
these formulas?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.837
Use a mnemonic device.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.799
Like, "Anefru, Babbashar,

13:16.879 --> 13:20.799
Kalhla, Dastra..."

13:21.718 --> 13:23.844
Babylonian kings,

13:21.718 --> 13:23.844
Third Dynasty.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.305
Stop complaining.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.265
I have homework, too.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.267
Oh, it's a butterfly.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.770
Malcolm, you got to help me.

13:31.810 --> 13:32.729
What's going on?

13:32.771 --> 13:33.896
It's horrible.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.940
There was $400 missing

13:33.938 --> 13:35.940
from the register

13:35.982 --> 13:38.652
at the end of my shift,

13:35.982 --> 13:38.652
and they think I took it.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.320
Well, did you?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.862
No. Of course not.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.740
I'm Barton.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.740
Who's this dork?

13:43.782 --> 13:45.784
He's my tutor.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.784
You're kidding me.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.327
The one time I need you

13:45.824 --> 13:47.327
to be a genius,

13:47.368 --> 13:49.663
I find out you're faking

13:47.368 --> 13:49.663
the whole smart thing?

13:49.704 --> 13:50.580
Reese, calm down.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.498
How did this happen?

13:51.539 --> 13:52.915
I don't know.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.915
My register didn't

13:52.957 --> 13:54.959
total up right

13:52.957 --> 13:54.959
at the end of the shift.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.877
Who was there?

13:55.001 --> 13:56.877
Everyone:

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
Me, Sean, Greta, Richie.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.923
Richie? Why didn't you

13:58.588 --> 14:00.923
say so in the first place?

14:00.965 --> 14:03.884
What do you mean?

14:00.965 --> 14:03.884
It's Richie,

14:00.965 --> 14:03.884
he's setting you up.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.886
How do you know?

14:03.926 --> 14:05.886
Because it's Richie.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.597
Come on.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.309
Barton, you want to go learn

14:09.015 --> 14:11.309
something about the real world?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.436
Not really.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.436
Too bad. You're coming.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.315
(Barton grunting, thuds)

14:15.938 --> 14:17.315
Dewey, you have to cover for us.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.484
Make sure it sounds like

14:17.357 --> 14:19.484
we're all still here.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.568
Got it.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.487
Ow...

14:22.529 --> 14:23.697
Stop it!

14:23.738 --> 14:25.156
You shut up.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.492
Stupid creeps...

14:27.534 --> 14:29.327
Ow... stop it...

14:29.369 --> 14:30.495
(whispers):

14:29.369 --> 14:30.495
Did you get it?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.206
Yes, I got it.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.416
The pet store owner told

14:33.247 --> 14:35.416
me it was already dead.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.794
But I suspect the worst.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.547
We'll switch the fish tonight

14:37.836 --> 14:40.547
when Dewey's sleeping.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.798
I don't know, Lois.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.758
It seems so sneaky

14:41.840 --> 14:43.758
and underhanded.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.511
What kind of example are

14:43.800 --> 14:46.511
we setting for the boys?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.928
Oh, Hal, stop worrying.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.056
The boys are fine.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.017
(TV playing)

14:53.059 --> 14:55.353
Hey, dude, did you get

14:53.059 --> 14:55.353
the money?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.647
Yeah, you'd like another 400,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.647
wouldn't you?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.357
What are you talking about?

14:59.399 --> 15:02.736
Wow, an entire colony

14:59.399 --> 15:02.736
of  Cryphonectria parasitica.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.028
Hey, get your own pizza, Dewey.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.405
His name's

15:04.070 --> 15:05.405
not Dewey.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.408
So, how come you've had me call

15:05.446 --> 15:08.408
him Dewey all these years?

15:08.449 --> 15:09.950
Look, we know you

15:08.449 --> 15:09.950
took the money

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
and you're just trying

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
to pin it on Reese.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.121
After everything

15:11.994 --> 15:14.121
my brother's done for you.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.790
All the alibis,

15:14.163 --> 15:15.790
all the handouts,

15:15.832 --> 15:18.042
all the times he's helped you

15:15.832 --> 15:18.042
fake your death.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.003
Whoa, dudes, I wasn't

15:18.084 --> 15:21.003
even there today.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.882
The only time I came in

15:21.045 --> 15:23.882
was to cash out.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.174
You were right there.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.967
Yeah, but I had

15:25.216 --> 15:26.967
a ten-minute

15:25.216 --> 15:26.967
break at 4:30.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.637
You could've snuck in

15:27.009 --> 15:29.637
then and taken the money.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.431
Well, yeah, but...

15:31.472 --> 15:32.973
You want to play innocent?

15:33.015 --> 15:35.685
Fine, we'll just let

15:33.015 --> 15:35.685
the police decide.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.271
Whoa, police.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.857
What makes you think the cops

15:38.312 --> 15:40.857
are going to take your side?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.650
Maybe 'cause you've

15:40.899 --> 15:42.650
already been arrested

15:42.692 --> 15:44.026
like ten times

15:42.692 --> 15:44.026
for petty theft.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.238
Excuse me, one of

15:44.068 --> 15:47.238
those was for arson.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.989
(keys beeping)

15:49.031 --> 15:50.991
I'm telling you, you're

15:49.031 --> 15:50.991
making a big mistake.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.702
No, I'm not.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.702
Yes, you are.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.037
No, I'm not.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.037
Yes, you are.

15:56.038 --> 15:56.997
He didn't do it.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.625
According to

15:57.039 --> 15:58.625
this citation,

15:58.666 --> 16:01.586
Richie was stopped at 4:20 today

15:58.666 --> 16:01.586
at 18th and Wilson

16:01.628 --> 16:03.880
for urinating

16:01.628 --> 16:03.880
from a moving vehicle.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.006
So?

16:03.922 --> 16:06.006
So, the Circus Burger is

16:06.048 --> 16:08.718
on Walnut,

16:06.048 --> 16:08.718
which is at least 25 miles away.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.011
He couldn't have gotten there

16:08.760 --> 16:11.011
during Reese's break.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.639
Well, maybe if

16:11.053 --> 16:12.639
the traffic

16:11.053 --> 16:12.639
was light...

16:12.680 --> 16:14.891
Yeah, and maybe

16:12.680 --> 16:14.891
if a '78 Bonneville could go

16:14.933 --> 16:16.893
300 miles an hour.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.102
Otherwise, it's impossible.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.104
Hey, hey,

16:18.144 --> 16:20.104
way to go, Dewey!

16:20.146 --> 16:22.106
Let me see that.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.900
Is he right?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.025
Yes.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.653
He's always right.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.070
Sorry, Richie.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.906
Come on, Reese, let's go.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.116
But I swear to God,

16:29.948 --> 16:32.116
I didn't do it.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.034
I didn't take the money.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.621
Well, look, we still

16:34.076 --> 16:36.621
have a few hours.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.872
Maybe we can figure out...

16:37.914 --> 16:39.206
GRETA:

16:37.914 --> 16:39.206
Richie, I got us the DVD player

16:39.248 --> 16:41.459
but we need to steal

16:39.248 --> 16:41.459
another $600

16:41.501 --> 16:43.461
if you want the surround...

16:44.754 --> 16:46.005
...sound.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.050
You may want to hang

16:47.131 --> 16:50.050
on to that receipt.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.552
I can't believe you lied.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.053
We're calling the cops.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.096
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.056
Maybe we can figure

16:54.138 --> 16:56.056
out some sort of deal.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.143
Whatever you guys

16:56.098 --> 16:59.143
want, it's yours.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.564
We get to use your place

17:00.770 --> 17:03.564
for a party anytime we want.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.775
Yeah, and we get

17:03.606 --> 17:05.775
free burgers for life.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.861
And I get to make out

17:05.817 --> 17:07.861
with your girlfriend.

17:07.902 --> 17:08.653
Forget it.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.197
All right,

17:08.695 --> 17:11.197
the beanbag chair.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.580
Wow, Pete,

17:16.619 --> 17:19.580
is that really you?

17:19.622 --> 17:22.583
No, it's a reflection.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.335
Here, you can give these

17:22.625 --> 17:24.335
to Svetlana.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.587
Eric and Artie should

17:24.377 --> 17:26.587
be back any minute

17:26.629 --> 17:28.088
from Mamu with your bride.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.256
I got to be honest.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.133
I'm a little...

17:29.298 --> 17:31.133
I'm a little nervous.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.762
Well, you are about to

17:31.175 --> 17:34.762
marry a total stranger.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.264
Have you really thought

17:34.804 --> 17:37.264
about what you're doing?

17:37.306 --> 17:38.892
Oh, I've been thinking

17:37.306 --> 17:38.892
about settling down

17:38.933 --> 17:41.101
for a long, long time.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.354
Yeah, but you don't know

17:41.143 --> 17:43.354
anything about her.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.272
I mean, what if

17:43.396 --> 17:45.272
she thinks you're...

17:45.314 --> 17:47.483
What if she

17:45.314 --> 17:47.483
doesn't like you?

17:47.525 --> 17:51.195
Well, I'd be sad,

17:47.525 --> 17:51.195
but I'd reassure her

17:51.237 --> 17:54.114
that I'd support her anyway,

17:51.237 --> 17:54.114
because I made that commitment.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.783
Then I guess I'd spend

17:55.825 --> 17:58.745
the rest of my life

17:55.825 --> 17:58.745
being sweet to her

17:58.786 --> 18:01.539
in the hopes

17:58.786 --> 18:01.539
of changing her mind.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.542
Well, good luck, Pete.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.002
Thanks.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.379
Svetlana's here.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.799
And she is gorgeous.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.300
(laughing)

18:13.342 --> 18:14.594
Oh!

18:14.635 --> 18:16.220
I must have...

18:16.262 --> 18:18.639
misread the catalog.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.141
Just look how light

18:18.681 --> 18:21.141
on her feet she is.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.142
(laughing continues)

18:22.184 --> 18:24.020
Hey, baby.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.020
Whoa, whoa,

18:22.184 --> 18:24.020
whoa, whoa.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.813
(laughing continues)

18:25.855 --> 18:27.607
Hey, guys...

18:32.194 --> 18:34.154
Oh, hey, Pete...

18:34.196 --> 18:35.406
Just get that thing out of here.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.407
I'll take care of it.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.366
I got it.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.367
Why you?

18:38.409 --> 18:39.953
Because I signed for it.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.288
Who cares if you signed for it?

18:39.994 --> 18:42.288
Wait a minute. Come here.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.262
(car horn honking)

18:58.304 --> 18:59.555
Oh, there's our ride.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.181
So nice of

18:59.597 --> 19:01.181
Richie to drive

18:59.597 --> 19:01.181
you to school.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.017
Yeah, well,

19:01.223 --> 19:03.017
that's just his way

19:03.059 --> 19:05.185
of saying, "Thanks

19:03.059 --> 19:05.185
for a job well done."

19:05.227 --> 19:07.438
Good morning, everybody.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.023
Now, son, don't

19:07.480 --> 19:09.023
be disappointed.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.190
Say good morning, Charlie.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.152
Show everyone

19:10.232 --> 19:13.152
how  alive  you are.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.782
Aren't I doing

19:15.613 --> 19:17.782
a good job?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.159
Yeah, yeah, great.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.501
That little monster.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.211
He's been buying his own fish

19:28.542 --> 19:31.211
and switching them.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.506
God only knows

19:31.253 --> 19:33.506
how many he's gone through.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.091
He's going to pay for this.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.216
Well, how?

19:36.258 --> 19:39.178
If we bust him,

19:36.258 --> 19:39.178
he'll know we've

19:36.258 --> 19:39.178
been cheating, too.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.224
Dewey,

19:44.266 --> 19:45.852
your father and I are so proud

19:45.893 --> 19:48.228
of the way you've taken care

19:45.893 --> 19:48.228
of that fish.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.480
Yes, we are.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.941
You certainly proved to us

19:49.522 --> 19:51.941
that you can be trusted.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.818
It's so nice

19:51.983 --> 19:53.818
to have a boy

19:53.860 --> 19:55.820
who's so conscientious,

19:53.860 --> 19:55.820
responsible

19:55.862 --> 19:58.238
and honest,

19:55.862 --> 19:58.238
and who always finds a way

19:58.280 --> 19:59.782
to do the right thing.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.036
Before we go any further,

20:03.077 --> 20:05.955
is there anything

20:03.077 --> 20:05.955
you want to tell me?

20:05.997 --> 20:07.957
I want a beagle.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.918
Well, you're not going

20:07.999 --> 20:10.918
to get it, you little sneak!

20:10.960 --> 20:13.295
We know that you've been

20:10.960 --> 20:13.295
switching fish on us

20:13.337 --> 20:16.132
because I put a dead fish

20:13.337 --> 20:16.132
in there last night.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.508
That's cheating!

20:17.550 --> 20:18.885
You're cheaters!

20:18.926 --> 20:22.304
(sobbing)

20:22.346 --> 20:24.306
(door slams shut)

20:22.346 --> 20:24.306
Well, not exactly textbook

20:24.348 --> 20:26.767
but at least we're not

20:24.348 --> 20:26.767
getting a dog.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.354
I cleaned out my cubby.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.107
You're sure I can't

20:30.396 --> 20:33.107
talk you into staying?

20:33.149 --> 20:35.109
My mom says I need

20:33.149 --> 20:35.109
a healthier environment.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.153
She thinks it's creepy

20:35.151 --> 20:37.153
the way you're using me

20:37.195 --> 20:38.654
for your own

20:37.195 --> 20:38.654
self-aggrandizement.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.073
A healthier environment?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.365
That is not what you need.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.659
Son, you will never

20:41.407 --> 20:43.659
connect normally

20:43.701 --> 20:44.994
with another human being.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.205
People will recognize

20:45.036 --> 20:47.205
your brilliance

20:47.246 --> 20:48.748
and they will

20:47.246 --> 20:48.748
loathe you for it.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.666
The best you can hope for

20:48.789 --> 20:50.666
is uncomprehending fear...

20:50.708 --> 20:54.336
(whispers):

20:50.708 --> 20:54.336
which I can channel

20:50.708 --> 20:54.336
into great things.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.589
Please?

20:56.630 --> 20:58.716
Can I go now?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.300
Sure.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.844
Go.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.723
You, my ex-wife...

21:05.765 --> 21:08.768
all of my therapists,

21:05.765 --> 21:08.768
you're all the same.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.769
Bye, guys.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.020
Bye, Barton.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.230
Good luck at NASA.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.313
Send us a letter

21:13.355 --> 21:15.942
when you get

21:13.355 --> 21:15.942
declassified.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.864
Mr. Herkabe, we know this

21:17.818 --> 21:21.864
is hard for you, so...

21:26.035 --> 21:27.036
It's his dad.

21:27.078 --> 21:29.038
We Photoshopped

21:27.078 --> 21:29.038
your head in.
