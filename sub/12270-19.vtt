The Evermoor Chronicles...

00:02.840 --> 00:05.560
(FOUNDER)
Give us three fated villagers to inhabit.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.040
-(LACIE) Where's the third?
-Let it happen.

00:08.200 --> 00:13.000
-(LACIE) Come back with our sister!
-She is protected by love.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.760
Where was this girl before?

00:14.920 --> 00:18.280
This is what happens
when you play with people's hearts.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.000
(SEB) I saw you and Cameron.
This break-up just became real.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.000
(TARA)
Stop the dance!

00:25.000 --> 00:26.120
(GURGLING)

00:27.000 --> 00:29.960
The bog! We're sinking into it!

00:33.440 --> 00:36.920
# I left my friends for my new life #

00:37.040 --> 00:40.000
# How will I know
It's gonna be all right? #

00:40.160 --> 00:42.920
# I got to take control #

00:43.040 --> 00:47.080
# And write my destiny #

00:47.280 --> 00:49.560
# The future's still untold #

00:49.760 --> 00:52.320
# Nobody else can see #

00:52.480 --> 00:57.160
# If this will be Forevermoor #

THE EGG AND THE SNOOT

01:11.960 --> 01:14.560
(CHATTERING)
(DOYLE) Quiet, please.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.200
Quiet!

01:18.920 --> 01:24.400
I can assure you that no bog creature
has been sighted on the moors!

01:24.520 --> 01:26.360
Bogzilla.

01:26.520 --> 01:31.000
I know what this is.
This is the Epic Sludge!

01:31.160 --> 01:33.160
(JAKE)
The Epic what?

01:33.360 --> 01:38.960
The Epic Sludge is when the moors rise up
and swallow everything in their path.

01:39.080 --> 01:44.080
So, if there was a creature living
in the mud, then--

01:44.280 --> 01:47.200
He'd rise up too.
(IN UNISON) Bogzilla!

01:47.400 --> 01:51.040
Could we have sensible suggestions only,
please!

01:51.200 --> 01:54.840
I propose that we dig a giant plug hole

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
and simply drain the mud away,
like a bath!

01:59.160 --> 02:02.760
Excellent idea. Excellent!
(MURMURS)

02:02.920 --> 02:06.160
Why don't we get help
from outside the village?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.520
(GASPS)

02:11.280 --> 02:14.360
-What is this, Otto?
-Punishment.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.280
We had a deal and you broke it.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.960
The bog is rising.

02:19.080 --> 02:24.440
It will swallow all of Evermoor,
like Hollowfall before it.

02:24.560 --> 02:29.160
(ESMERELDA)
We couldn't stop it even if we wanted to.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.600
-Unless...
-(ESMERELDA) Unless we were three.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.000
And regained our powers.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.440
Release her from love's sickly hold
and give her to us.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.600
Or lose the village beneath the mud.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.480
(CAMERON) All of Evermoor consumed by
the bog.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.080
It was staring us right in the face.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.680
Pop's going to kill me.

02:55.880 --> 03:00.320
Otto, your dad stopped the Founders
once, right? He could do it again.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.320
You said opening the door would suck
the Founders into the demigod realm.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.400
The doorway is shut. It's not opening
again until my punishment is up.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.680
It's not happening for a thousand years.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.520
They are way harsh up there.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.400
It won't open for anything?

03:14.520 --> 03:17.480
My father will only come
before the punishment is up,

03:17.600 --> 03:19.480
if I meet my demise.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.760
(CLEARS THROAT)
That can't be the only way.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.480
Well, there is the egg.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.600
-Did you lay that?
-No, I didn't lay it!

03:37.800 --> 03:41.400
-What is it?
-This was my father's parting gift

03:41.520 --> 03:44.200
when he banished me to this
a thousand years ago.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.160
This, he said, is a simple puzzle.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.040
Solve it, and I prove I have grown
and learned my lesson,

03:51.200 --> 03:53.600
and thus be released
from my punishment.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.560
-The Founders get pulled in?
-They'd be helpless.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.360
You're telling me you've had this
for years and haven't solved it?

04:00.480 --> 04:02.280
No.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.960
I gave up after two hundred.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.000
No, this is good. A puzzle we can do.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.560
Finally, a bit of logic required!

04:09.760 --> 04:11.560
Did your dad give you any clues?

04:11.760 --> 04:15.040
Yes. He laughed when he gave it to me.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.080
(CLATTERING)

04:19.280 --> 04:23.040
You know, my life used to be pretty
glamorous before I came here.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.280
Oh, you got something on your--

04:28.160 --> 04:30.160
Oh, yeah, that's better.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.880
(GASPS) Footprints!

04:34.000 --> 04:39.280
What have I told you about wearing
your clown shoes in the house?

04:43.920 --> 04:45.680
Jakey-boy?

04:48.040 --> 04:52.120
I saw him. He came right by me.

04:52.320 --> 04:58.080
(JAKE) Seven feet tall,
lurching like a sludgy beast.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.000
Bogzilla.
(LUDO GASPS)

05:01.400 --> 05:04.000
I saw into his soul.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.480
We locked eyes.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.680
And what did you see?

05:09.680 --> 05:12.280
He's not from around here.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.840
This is it.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.880
This is my big chance.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.400
Too long have I tried and failed
to make the cover of Eerie Theories.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.560
If there was ever a time to find fame
and fortune in the unknown,

05:31.760 --> 05:33.960
that time is now.

05:34.960 --> 05:40.320
Jakey-boy, we're going to catch ourselves
a mud creature!

05:40.960 --> 05:45.440
-How long have you been practicing that?
-Six years.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.360
Maybe it takes voice commands.

05:50.480 --> 05:55.120
It was all I had to speak to before Tara
came along, so I've said everything.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.200
There has to be a solution.
It just has to be found.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.880
What did you do wrong? To be sent here?

06:01.000 --> 06:06.600
For my birthday my father gave me a wish.
So, I wished for my own chariot.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.880
But it was a test, and I failed it.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.160
I was supposed to wish to help someone.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.160
-You got a lesson, for a birthday present?
-I know!

06:16.360 --> 06:21.360
I was so angry, I took father's chariot.
It caused a year of thunder on Earth.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.480
Pop sent me to learn about mortals.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.400
As the snoot they gave thanks to,
I was to hear about their lives,

06:27.520 --> 06:31.280
their triumphs and tribulations,
learn to understand them.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.520
You discovered
what makes people great?

06:33.680 --> 06:38.000
No. My goodness, you people are boring.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.480
(SIGHS) All I could do was wait it out.

06:42.480 --> 06:47.480
So the solution to the egg
has something to do with people?

06:48.880 --> 06:53.080
Children! The bog has swallowed...

06:56.520 --> 06:58.000
(TEARFULLY) ...my statue.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.320
School is canceled until further notice.

07:01.480 --> 07:06.000
(BREATHES DEEPLY) May Fate be with
the plughole diggers.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.680
We're running out of time.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
We live in a magic village, right?

07:14.160 --> 07:17.960
Why don't we use magic to solve the egg?

07:18.080 --> 07:20.160
I bet Otto didn't try that.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.800
Look at you, Mr. Magic Pants.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.120
(SEB)
Okay, so we ask the tapestry.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.320
-Tell them, Sorsha.
-(SORSHA) Here.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.800

traveler would come to town

The All-Knowing Zeltosh."

07:44.640 --> 07:47.160
Tapestry o tapestry,

07:47.360 --> 07:52.000
please send us the crystal ball
of The All-Knowing Zeltosh.

07:52.160 --> 07:56.880
Just to be clear, not The All-Knowing
Zeltosh. Just his crystal ball.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.680
Tapestry o tapestry.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.920

08:02.040 --> 08:04.080
(CLATTERS)

08:06.680 --> 08:09.880
Sweet Veronica, I got what I asked for.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.480
The puzzle must be reflected in its glass.
Then you ask the ball to solve it.

08:17.120 --> 08:21.760
Please, tell us the solution to this egg.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.360
It's a thing of beauty.

08:40.560 --> 08:43.320
You don't think it's too big?

08:43.520 --> 08:47.000
(LUDO)
Hello. We're catching Bogzilla.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.760
Let's go through it one more time.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.240
We know he likes Yuck bars, that's a fact.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.840
He follows the trail to here,
takes the bait,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.440
which tips the scales,
knocking the books over,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.920
that turns the light on, dazzling him.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.880
That's when the camera goes off.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.840
Right. Then the counterweight
sets the ball rolling,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.120
which releases the lever,
and drops the basket.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.400
You don't think it's a little...
elaborate?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.600
(LUDO)
Well, what would you propose?

09:19.760 --> 09:24.280
I don't know. Put food in a store room
and when he goes in shut the door.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.920
Well, we've built it now.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.160
You did what?

09:32.320 --> 09:35.880
We just tried the one thing
you hadn't in all this time, magic.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.800
You didn't think there was
a reason I didn't try it?

09:38.960 --> 09:41.600
Admittedly, not until just now.

09:41.760 --> 09:46.040
The demigods despise cheating!
It's up there with being a scaredy cat.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
The egg is not only magic-resistant

09:48.360 --> 09:52.360
but the very act of using magic on it
sets off its anti-tampering mechanism.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.000
Anti-tampering mechanism?

09:54.160 --> 09:56.720
It doles out a punishment
on those who cheated,

09:56.880 --> 09:59.000
to teach them a lesson on why we don't.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.080
What kind of punishment?

10:01.240 --> 10:04.120
What's the one punishment you'd hate most?

10:04.280 --> 10:08.080
(TEARFULLY) To have my clothes,
and make-up confiscated.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.000
It's different for everyone.
Rest assured, it'll happen to you all.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.800
And you can't escape it.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.160
See what I'm dealing with?
Why haven't you got your punishment?

# Singing without my consent #

10:50.440 --> 10:53.240
(GASPS) Seb hates musicals.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.760
That's not musical.
That's the sound of stepping on a plug.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.520
# That's why I hate the things #

10:59.680 --> 11:03.280

11:20.960 --> 11:22.280

11:25.000 --> 11:28.800
My worst punishment.
Not being able to communicate with Seb.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.720
On the plus side,
at least you can't hear him singing.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.320
Why haven't you gotten
your punishment yet?

-(MUTTERS) Sweet Veronica.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.240
Bella got turned to stone
and I had to get her back,

12:10.400 --> 12:14.400
and the only way to do that was
with a love's kiss.

(SOFT CHUCKLE)

12:19.000 --> 12:22.280

I had to. I had to.

losing Cameron's trust.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.000
-Hardest of all to get back.
-It's horrible, Otto.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.720
-How do I make it stop?
-You don't.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.000
You just serve your time,
wait out the punishment.

years.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.600

13:04.760 --> 13:08.600
You just have to sweat it out.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.520
What kind of solution is that?

13:10.680 --> 13:12.280
When does it end?
