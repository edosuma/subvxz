WEBVTT

01:23.543 --> 01:26.129
[CHIRPING]

01:35.805 --> 01:39.142
AH. FEED ME, WOMAN.
I'M STARVED.

01:39.309 --> 01:41.770
JUST ABOUT READY.
YOU'RE EARLY.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.313
I LOADED SACKS
WITH BOTH HANDS.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.814
WANTED
TO GET HOME IN TIME

01:44.981 --> 01:46.483
TO START WORK
ON THAT CUPBOARD.

01:46.649 --> 01:47.901
WHAT CUPBOARD?

01:48.067 --> 01:49.235
THE HAND-CARVED ONE

01:49.402 --> 01:50.445
I'M GOING TO MAKE
FOR MRS. JOHNSON.

01:50.612 --> 01:51.738
CHARLES, YOU'VE NEVER MADE

01:51.905 --> 01:53.156
HAND-CARVED FURNITURE
BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE.

01:53.323 --> 01:54.574
I KNOW THAT.
I DIDN'T DO TOO BAD

01:54.741 --> 01:56.242
ON THAT DOLL I CARVED
FOR CARRIE, DID I?

01:56.409 --> 01:57.368
No, BuT..

01:57.535 --> 01:58.745
WELL, THEN, YOU GOT
TO GIVE IT A TRY.

01:58.912 --> 02:00.246
THERE'S NO WAY TO
TELL UNLESS YOU TRY.

02:00.413 --> 02:01.873
BESIDES, WE CAN USE
THE EXTRA MONEY.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.917
HOW MUCH
WILL SHE PAY YOU?

02:04.083 --> 02:05.418
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

02:05.585 --> 02:07.420
THERE WAS NO WAY
I COULD SET A PRICE

02:07.587 --> 02:09.130
ON SOMETHING I'VE
NEVER DONE BEFORE.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.549
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL CARVE
BETTER THAN YOU DO BUSINESS.

02:11.716 --> 02:13.760
NOW SIT DOWN
AND HAVE YOUR LUNCH.

02:13.927 --> 02:15.094
YES, MA'AM.

02:15.261 --> 02:17.138
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO EAT SOMETHING?

02:17.305 --> 02:19.182
CARRIE ALREADY HAD LUNCH,
AND I'M NOT HUNGRY.

02:19.349 --> 02:22.894
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ENOUGH
LATELY TO KEEP A BIRD ALIVE.

02:23.061 --> 02:25.063
I'LL GAIN WEIGHT
SOON ENOUGH.

02:25.230 --> 02:26.773
ALL WOMEN DO.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.566
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT WEIGHT.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.109
YOU TAKE
AFTER YOUR MOTHER.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.071
NO WAY IN THE WORLD YOU'RE
GOING TO GAIN ANY POUNDS.

02:33.238 --> 02:34.989
THERE'S ONE WAY.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.951
WELL, IF THERE IS,
I'D SURE LIKE TO KNOW...

03:00.348 --> 03:01.724
A BABY.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.142
ARE YOU HAPPY?

03:03.309 --> 03:06.312
WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
IS THAT TO ASK ME?

03:06.479 --> 03:07.856
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.357
YOU WORK
SO HARD NOW,

03:09.524 --> 03:10.859
AND WITH ANOTHER
MOUTH TO FEED--

03:11.025 --> 03:14.404
WELL, YOU LET ME WORRY
ABOUT THAT, ALL RIGHT?

03:14.571 --> 03:16.364
A BABY.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.034
I GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.661
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
FINISHED YOUR LUNCH.

03:21.828 --> 03:23.162
I COULDN'T
EAT A THING.

03:23.329 --> 03:26.124
I'M GOING TO BUILD
A CUPBOARD FIT FOR A QUEEN.

03:27.584 --> 03:29.878
A BABY.

03:34.507 --> 03:36.342
I LOVE YOU.

03:57.113 --> 04:00.033
WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:00.199 --> 04:02.035
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

04:02.201 --> 04:04.120
WHERE I COULD GET
A LITTLE EXTRA ROOM.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.705
YOU KNOW,
ADD A LITTLE SPACE.

04:05.872 --> 04:07.165
WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT.

04:07.332 --> 04:10.126
WE'RE GOING TO WANT HIM
RIGHT CLOSE TO US.

04:11.419 --> 04:14.380
WELL, THE BABY WON'T
BE ALONG FOR 6 MONTHS.

04:14.547 --> 04:16.674
I THINK YOU COULD
WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT

04:16.841 --> 04:18.509
TO START BUILDING.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.553
I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:22.722 --> 04:25.642
I JUST CAN'T
GET OVER IT, THOUGH.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.101
A BABY.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.813
NOT NECESSARILY
A BOY.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.399
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A BOY?

04:33.566 --> 04:36.569
YOU SAID WE'LL
WANT HIM CLOSE TO US.

04:36.736 --> 04:38.112
DID I SAY THAT?

04:38.279 --> 04:39.614
YOU SAID THAT.

04:39.781 --> 04:41.240
I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.034
NO.

04:44.494 --> 04:45.870
GOOD NIGHT.

04:46.037 --> 04:47.330
GOOD NIGHT.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.218
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW,

05:00.385 --> 05:02.303
THE ODDS ARE
WE'LL HAVE A BOY.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.930
WE'VE HAD 3 GIRLS.

05:04.097 --> 05:05.807
MM-

05:05.974 --> 05:09.060
YOU REMEMBER THE STEVENSONS
IN WISCONSIN?

05:09.227 --> 05:12.271
MM-HMM.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.774
11 GIRLS.

05:14.941 --> 05:16.985
OH.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.285
I'LL DO MY BEST.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.579
HA HA HA!

05:31.416 --> 05:33.167
I LOVE YOU.

05:38.673 --> 05:41.718
ARE YOU GLAD
ABOUT THE BABY?

05:41.884 --> 05:43.636
WHAT?

05:43.803 --> 05:46.681
ARE YOU GLAD THAT MA'S
GOING TO HAVE A BABY?

05:46.848 --> 05:48.433
SURE. AREN'T YOU?

05:48.599 --> 05:50.393
I SUPPOSE.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.770
YOU BETTER
GET TO SLEEP.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.733
DO YOU WANT A BROTHER
OR A SISTER?

05:56.899 --> 05:58.609
I DON'T CARE.

05:58.776 --> 06:01.279
PA WANTS A BOY,
YOU KNOW.

06:01.446 --> 06:03.281
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

06:03.448 --> 06:04.407
BECAUSE EVERY TIME

06:04.574 --> 06:06.325
HE TALKED ABOUT
THE BABY AT SUPPER,

06:06.492 --> 06:07.910
HE SAID "HIM" OR "HE."

06:08.077 --> 06:09.495
THAT'S HOW I KNOW.

06:09.662 --> 06:10.997
WELL, ONLY GOD
KNOWS

06:11.164 --> 06:12.498
IF IT'S
A BOY OR A GIRL,

06:12.665 --> 06:15.418
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GO TO SLEEP.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.729
I HOPE
GOD WANTS A GIRL.

07:11.766 --> 07:13.309
YOU LIKE THAT.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.353
COME ON.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.689
[SCRAPING]

07:27.240 --> 07:28.449
HI.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.742
HI.

07:29.909 --> 07:31.202
I THOUGHT YOU
FINISHED THE CUPBOARD.

07:31.369 --> 07:33.871
I DID. I'M GOING TO TAKE
IT INTO TOWN TOMORROW

07:34.038 --> 07:35.373
AS SOON AS
THE FINISH DRIES.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.916
WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE MAKING?

07:37.083 --> 07:38.918
I HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF LUMBER LEFT OVER.

07:39.085 --> 07:40.670
I THOUGHT
I'D PUT IT TO USE.

07:40.837 --> 07:42.463
ON WHAT?

07:43.756 --> 07:45.299
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A SURPRISE,

07:45.466 --> 07:47.760
BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW IT
TO YOU ANYWAY.

07:51.389 --> 07:53.391
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:53.558 --> 07:55.852
HA HA HA!

07:56.018 --> 07:57.770
I THINK
YOU'RE EXPECTING

07:57.937 --> 08:00.106
A LARGER BABY
THAN I CAN DELIVER.

08:00.273 --> 08:01.858
OH.

08:03.151 --> 08:05.528
I GUESS IT IS
A LITTLE BIG, ISN'T IT?

08:05.695 --> 08:07.446
I'D SAY SO.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.408
WELL, I JUST FIGURED A BABY
NEEDS ROOM TO MOVE AROUND.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.243
YOU MARK MY WORDS.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

08:12.410 --> 08:14.620
HE'LL OUTGROW THIS
IN NO TIME.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.789
YOU JUST
SAID IT AGAIN.

08:16.956 --> 08:18.541
JUST SAID WHAT AGAIN?

08:18.708 --> 08:20.960
HE.

08:21.127 --> 08:23.629
OH.

08:27.258 --> 08:30.845
I NEVER EVEN REALIZED
I SAID IT.

08:31.012 --> 08:33.306
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID
IT. I'M SORRY.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.349
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER
NOT TO SAY IT.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.977
I KNOW. YOU KEEP
TELLING ME THAT.

08:38.144 --> 08:40.146
IT JUST SOUNDS FUNNY TO ME
CALLING A BABY AN IT.

08:40.313 --> 08:42.523
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'D BE A LITTLE PUT OUT

08:42.690 --> 08:44.609
IF SOMEBODY JUST
KEPT CALLING YOU "IT"?

08:44.775 --> 08:46.319
I THINK I'D FEEL
WORSE, CHARLES,

08:46.485 --> 08:47.653
IF I WERE A GIRL

08:47.820 --> 08:50.239
AND SOMEBODY KEPT
CALLING ME A BOY.

08:50.406 --> 08:51.407
UH!

08:51.574 --> 08:52.909
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:53.075 --> 08:54.994
HE JUST KICKED!
HA HA!

08:55.161 --> 08:56.996
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

08:57.163 --> 09:00.041
THE BABY!
HE JUST KICKED!

09:00.208 --> 09:01.667
IT JUST KICKED.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.169
OH.

09:03.336 --> 09:05.755
HA HA HA!

09:14.597 --> 09:17.975
AND WE THANK YOU, O LORD,
FOR MAKING US STRONG

09:18.142 --> 09:19.352
AND FOR GMNG US

09:19.518 --> 09:21.062
THE BOUNTIFUL GIFTS
OF YOUR LAND. AMEN.

09:21.229 --> 09:22.271
Caroline and kids: AMEN.

09:22.438 --> 09:25.566
I HOPE EVERYBODY'S
AS HUNGRY AS I AM.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.068
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION, MA?

09:27.235 --> 09:28.611
CERTAINLY. WHAT IS IT?

09:28.778 --> 09:30.446
WE WERE TALKING
AT SCHOOL TODAY,

09:30.613 --> 09:32.657
AND CHRISTY SAID WHEN
YOU HAVE A BABY,

09:32.823 --> 09:34.700
IT COMES OUT
IN A GIANT EGG

09:34.867 --> 09:36.744
AND YOU HAVE TO
BREAK IT OPEN

09:36.911 --> 09:38.204
WITH A BIG ROCK
OR SOMETHING.

09:38.371 --> 09:40.039
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHERE
SHE GOT THAT IDEA,

09:40.206 --> 09:41.415
BUT IT ISN'T SO.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.042
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S JUST LIKE

09:43.209 --> 09:45.753
WHEN MY PONY GOT
BORN. ISN'T IT, MA?

09:45.920 --> 09:47.088
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:47.255 --> 09:48.339
WELL,
I KNEW THAT.

09:48.506 --> 09:50.508
I WAS JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT CHRISTY SAID.

09:50.675 --> 09:52.385
I DON'T MIND QUESTIONS
AT THE TABLE,

09:52.551 --> 09:54.679
BUT I EXPECT YOU GIRLS TO EAT
YOUR SUPPER WHILE IT'S HOT.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.056
YES, PA.

09:57.223 --> 09:59.558
TODAY I PLAYED TWO
OLD CAT WITH A BOY.

09:59.725 --> 10:00.726
HEY.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.061
AND I WON HIM, TOO.

10:02.228 --> 10:04.438
YOU MEAN
YOU WON THE GAME.

10:04.605 --> 10:08.359
I BEAT ALL OF THEM,
EVEN JOHNNY JOHNSON.

10:08.526 --> 10:09.902
I THINK IT WOULD
BE MORE LADYLIKE

10:10.069 --> 10:11.988
IF YOU PLAYED
WITH THE GIRLS SOMETIMES.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.615
IT'S MORE FUN
PLAYING BOYS' GAMES,

10:14.782 --> 10:16.200
ISN'T IT, PA?

10:16.367 --> 10:17.618
YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.704
JOHNNY SAID
I'M A TOMBOY.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.248
THAT'S JUST
LIKE BEING A BOY.

10:22.415 --> 10:25.334
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
AM JUST LIKE A BOY.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.086
DON'T YOU THINK?

10:27.253 --> 10:28.879
I THINK I'VE
GOT A LITTLE GIRL

10:29.046 --> 10:31.048
WHO'S DOING A LOT MORE
TALKING THAN SHE IS EATING.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.717
YOU GET STARTED,
ALL RIGHT?

10:32.883 --> 10:34.176
YES, SIR.

10:35.386 --> 10:37.888
IT'S GOOD.

10:53.279 --> 10:55.656
Laura, voice-over: IT WAS
GETTING CLOSE To THE TIME

10:55.823 --> 10:57.783
WHEN THE BABY
WOULD COME, MA SAID.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.952
SHE WOULDN'T MAKE
THE TRIP TO TOWN ANYMORE,

11:00.119 --> 11:01.954
SO WE, MARY AND I,

11:02.121 --> 11:05.791
TOOK THE EGGS INTO OLESON'S
ON OUR WAY TO SCHOOL.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.155
I'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE EGGS
IF YOU WANT THEM.

11:36.322 --> 11:38.074
MM-MM. COULDN'T
EAT ANOTHER BITE.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.367
ARE YOU SURE?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.327
IT WILL ONLY TAKE ME
A MINUTE TO COOK THEM.

11:41.494 --> 11:43.996
COULDN'T DO IT.
BESIDES, I'M LATE.

11:44.163 --> 11:45.790

WILL YOU STOP BY
AND SEE IF GRACE

11:54.924 --> 11:56.675
WOULD LIKE TO COME
OUT FOR A VISIT TODAY?

11:56.842 --> 11:58.260
IT'S FRIDAY.
THAT'S MAIL DAY.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.388
SHE'S GOING
TO BE PRETTY BUSY.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.847
BUT YOU'LL ASK HER.

12:02.014 --> 12:04.600
SURE. SEE YOU LATER.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.326
DID YOU WANT GRACE TO COME
OUT FOR A SOCIAL CALL?

12:26.872 --> 12:28.249

12:28.416 --> 12:31.168
YES.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.384

12:56.986 --> 12:58.279
HOW MUCH LONGER?

12:58.446 --> 13:00.364
WELL, IT
CAN'T BE LONG NOW.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.326
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.917
IT'S COMING CLOSE
TOGETHER NOW.

13:12.084 --> 13:15.629
DON'T LOOK
SO CONCERNED.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.423
I'M FINE.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.925
I KNOW THAT.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.349
UGH.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.767
IT'S TIME.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.436
I KNOW! IT'S TIME!

OK, YOU GET ON OUT, NOW.
IT'S MY TURN.

YEAH.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.402
LOOK, ARE YOU SURE--

13:38.569 --> 13:40.488
GET ON OUT. I HAVE
SPANKED THE BEHINDS

IN WALNUT GROVE.

THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED ABOUT.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.189
YOUR MA'S OK.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.442
IT HURTS TO HAVE A BABY,
DON'T IT, PA?

IT'S A JOYOUS HURT.

I WANT A BABY.

YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.251
I'M NOT GOING
TO GET MARRIED.

14:35.417 --> 14:39.129
ME, NEITHER. I'M GOING
TO STAY WITH YOU, PA.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.966
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
IN YOUR LIFE

14:42.132 --> 14:43.592
TO BE MAKING
THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.219
WAIT A FEW YEARS,
AND YOU--

14:45.386 --> 14:46.387
[SLAP]

14:46.554 --> 14:49.098
[BABY CRYING]

14:54.603 --> 14:56.188
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

14:56.355 --> 14:58.524
Grace: YOU JUST HOLD
YOUR HORSES, PAPA.

14:58.691 --> 15:02.027
I WANT THIS BABY CLEAN
WHEN YOU SEE IT.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.157
CAN YOU HEAR HER?

15:08.617 --> 15:09.910
IT'S A GIRL.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.454
I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

15:12.621 --> 15:15.207
SHE KEEPS SAYING IT
OVER AND OVER.

15:15.374 --> 15:17.042
"IT'S A BOY."

15:32.516 --> 15:34.768
IT'S A BOY!

15:36.729 --> 15:39.064
A BOY.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.775
I GOT A SON.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.466
CHARLES INGALLS JR.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.762
I LOVE YOU.

16:20.648 --> 16:22.232
COME, SEE YOUR BROTHER.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.778
NOW, I DON'T WANT GERMS
ALL OVER THIS BABY.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.489
OH, lT'LL
JUST BE A MINUTE.

16:28.656 --> 16:30.991
JUST ONE MINUTE,
THEN.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.578
OH, HE'S SO SMALL.

16:36.038 --> 16:39.208
Charles: HE WON'T BE FOR
LONG. HE'LL GROW LIKE A WEED.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.294
HA HA HA!

16:44.463 --> 16:47.466
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR
BABY BROTHER, CARRIE?

16:47.633 --> 16:51.261
DOLLY.
CARRIE'S DOLLY.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.640
NO, SWEET THING.

16:54.807 --> 17:00.062
THAT'S MY SON--
CHARLES INGALLS JR.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.828
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT ME

17:15.994 --> 17:17.496
TO GIVE YOU A HAND
WITH THAT?

17:17.663 --> 17:19.289
NO. I'M STRONG
ENOUGH, PA.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.999
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.584
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.086
HA HA HA!

17:24.253 --> 17:25.629
YOU LEFT A PACKAGE.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.047
OH, THANK YOU, NELS.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.341
WHEN AM I GOING TO SEE
THIS BOY OF YOURS?

17:29.508 --> 17:31.176
YOU CAN SEE HIM SUNDAY
IF YOU DON'T OVERSLEEP.

17:31.343 --> 17:32.845
REVEREND ALDEN'S
GOING TO BAPTIZE HIM.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.012
Nels: I'LL BE THERE.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.180
GOOD.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.849
GRACE SNIDER TOLD ME
SHE'D NEVER FORGET

17:37.015 --> 17:37.933
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE

17:38.100 --> 17:39.351
WHEN SHE TOLD YOU
IT WAS A BOY.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.019
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE MOMENT SHE TOLD ME.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.688
I'LL BET
YOUR WIFE WAS HAPPY.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.356
THAT SHE WAS.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.608
A SON. YOU GOT
EVERYTHING A MAN

17:46.775 --> 17:48.318
COULD WANT NOW.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.862
THAT I DO.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.196
Harriet: NELS!

17:51.363 --> 17:53.365
AND YOU WERE AFRAID
I'D OVERSLEEP.

17:53.532 --> 17:54.950
I'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.327
SEE YOU SUNDAY.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.041
YOU ALL SET?

18:03.208 --> 18:04.626
YES, SIR.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.720
I'D GET SOME SLEEP
IF I WERE YOU.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.765
YOUR SON WILL
WAKE US UP SOON ENOUGH.

18:59.932 --> 19:03.101
I JUST CAN'T GET
OVER HOW TINY HE IS.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.687
LOOK AT HIM.

19:06.939 --> 19:08.607
SO TINY.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.196
NO MATTER HOW MANY
BABIES WE HAVE,

19:14.363 --> 19:16.031
I'M JUST GOING TO BE
SURPRISED AS EVER

19:16.198 --> 19:18.283
AT HOW TINY--
LOOK AT THOSE FEET!

19:18.450 --> 19:20.494
NOW, THOSE
ARE TINY FEET.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.163
I THINK
IT'S A PERFECT FOOT.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.375
OH, I THINK IT'S
A PERFECT FOOT, TOO.

19:26.542 --> 19:27.918
I JUST KIND OF
THOUGHT BOYS

19:28.085 --> 19:29.461
WOULD HAVE
BIGGER FEET.

19:29.628 --> 19:31.463
LOOK AT THAT.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.465
I WONDER
HOW MUCH HE WEIGHS.

19:33.632 --> 19:37.052
GRACE SAID THE DOCTOR WILL
BE OUT IN A DAY OR TWO.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.221
WE'LL FIND OUT THEN.

19:39.388 --> 19:42.015
HE REALLY
IS SOMETHING.

19:43.475 --> 19:48.230
HE SHOULD BE.
HE'S YOU.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.025
YOU MEAN US.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.863
BETTER GET SOME
SLEEP, YOU KNOW.

20:14.923 --> 20:18.010
Reverend Alden:
CHARLES FREDERICK INGALLS,

20:18.176 --> 20:20.429
I BAPTIZE THEE
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER

20:20.596 --> 20:24.808
AND OF THE SON
AND OF THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.184
Charles:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.686
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE ANOTHER STUDENT.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.146
WE'LL HAVE
TO ADD ANOTHER ROOM!

20:29.313 --> 20:30.147
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.690
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, REVEREND.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.609
YOU GOT A BOY
AT LAST, HUH?

20:33.775 --> 20:35.777
I CAN USE THAT HELP.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.821
CONGRATULATIONS,
INGALLS.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.407
YES. ISN'T IT
WONDERFUL?

20:40.574 --> 20:42.534
YES, IT IS,
MRS. OLESON.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.537
OH! WELL, NOW.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.206
LET'S SEE.
THAT'S, UH...

20:48.373 --> 20:49.249
5..

20:49.416 --> 20:52.377
NO. 4 NOW,
ISN'T IT, MRS. INGALLS?

20:52.544 --> 20:54.713
FOUR IS CORRECT,
MRS. OLESON.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.590
YES.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.092
I SUPPOSE

20:59.259 --> 21:01.303
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
WITH COUNTRY FOLK.

21:01.470 --> 21:04.514
SORT OF LIKE
BEING A BROODMARE.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.143
OF COURSE, IN MY CASE,

21:08.310 --> 21:11.980
NELLIE AND WILLIE
ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.857
IN THE CASE
OF NELLIE AND WILLIE,

21:14.024 --> 21:16.652
I COULDN'T
AGREE WITH YOU MORE.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.281
GOOD DAY.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.117
GOOD DAY,
MRS. OLESON.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.703
NELS, COME ALONG.

21:26.870 --> 21:27.788
YES, DEAR.

21:27.955 --> 21:29.831
AGAIN, THE BEST
TO ALL OF YOU.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.750
THANK YOU.

21:36.171 --> 21:38.465
WELL, HOW WAS
YOUR FRIEND TODAY?

21:38.632 --> 21:39.633
THAT WOMAN IS--

21:39.800 --> 21:41.093
CAROLINE,
IT'S SUNDAY.

21:41.259 --> 21:44.262
SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD TO
HAVE A CHRISTIAN FEELING.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.306
WELL, IF YOU
CAN'T PRAY FOR HER,

21:46.473 --> 21:49.059
AT LEAST PRAY
FOR HER HUSBAND!

21:49.226 --> 21:51.228
Laura: PA, LOOK!

21:51.395 --> 21:53.271
HUP, HUP, HUP!

21:53.438 --> 21:55.524
LOOK WHAT
MR. EDWARDS GOT US!

21:55.691 --> 21:57.651
POPCORN--
A BAG FOR EACH!

21:57.818 --> 21:58.777
Carrie: POPCORN!

21:58.944 --> 22:00.445
WELL,
THAT'S NICE OF HIM.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.447
WELL, WHY NOT?
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.658
AIN'T EVERY DAY I GET
TO BECOME A GODFATHER.

22:04.825 --> 22:07.035
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.539
HERE'S
YOUR LITTLE FIST.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.421
THE BALL GAME STARTS
IN 10 MINUTES!

22:17.587 --> 22:21.258
ALL MEN WANTING
TO PLAY, COME AHEAD!

22:23.677 --> 22:25.762
WELL, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO PLAY, PA?

22:25.929 --> 22:27.305
NO. I THINK I'LL JUST

22:27.472 --> 22:28.890
TAKE IT EASY TODAY,
HALF-PINT.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.475
YOUR SON
WILL BE FINE.

22:30.642 --> 22:31.977
WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD?

22:32.144 --> 22:33.603
PLEASE, PA?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.981
NAH. IT'S HIS DAY.

22:36.148 --> 22:38.025
BESIDES, BEFORE LONG,
HE'LL BE BIG ENOUGH

22:38.191 --> 22:40.652
TO BE OUT THERE ON A FIELD
PLAYING BASEBALL WITH ME.

22:40.819 --> 22:43.196
WELL, I GOT A FEELING THAT
MIGHT BE A YEAR OR TWO,

22:43.363 --> 22:45.824
SO I'M GOING TO GO ON
AND KEEP IN SHAPE.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.409
CAN WE GO
WITH MR. EDWARDS, MA?

22:47.576 --> 22:48.910
Caroline: ALL RIGHT.

22:49.077 --> 22:49.995
COME ON, BUTTON.

22:50.162 --> 22:52.164
GOT TO HIT A LONG ONE
FOR MY GODSON.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.879
ARE YOU COMING,
HALF-PINT?

22:59.046 --> 23:01.048
[BABY CRIES]

23:03.133 --> 23:04.760
YEAH.

23:27.199 --> 23:28.992
HE'S STILL
NOT GAINING.

23:29.159 --> 23:30.994
WELL, HE'S NOT GAINING,
BUT HE'S NOT LOSING.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.412
JUST HOLDING HIS OWN.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.082
I THINK WE'LL TRY TO PUT
HIM ON REGULAR MILK.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.167
I BELIEVE THAT
WILL DO THAT TRICK.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.794
BUT HIS APPETITE
IS GOOD.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.587
WELL, THERE MAY BE
SOMETHING WRONG

23:40.754 --> 23:42.255
WITH YOUR MILK,
MRS. INGALLS.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.882
IT'S JUST
BODY CHEMISTRY.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.425
THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL IT.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.885
IT NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

23:47.052 --> 23:48.720
WELL, NOW,
DON'T START WORRYING.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.514
EVERYBODY STARTS
WORRYING

23:50.680 --> 23:52.557
WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE
A FAT BABY.

23:52.724 --> 23:55.060
I'M NOT WORRIED,
JUST SO LONG AS YOU

23:55.227 --> 23:57.270
SAY EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.356
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.859
NOW, I BETTER
GET GOING.

24:03.026 --> 24:06.905
MISS ARNOLD HAS ANOTHER
ONE OF HER SORE THROATS,

24:07.072 --> 24:11.243
AND JUST BETWEEN US,
I THINK SHE LIKES

24:11.409 --> 24:15.122
THE KICK OF THAT
BIG-CITY COUGH MEDICINE.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.416
I'LL DROP BY NEXT WEEK.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.210
OH, WAIT.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.590
SIX EGGS,
ALL DOUBLE YOLKS.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.634
6? THAT'S TOO MANY!

24:27.801 --> 24:29.302
OR ARE YOU WORRIED

24:29.469 --> 24:31.721
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE A FAT DOCTOR?

24:31.888 --> 24:33.223
I JUST
FEEL SO FOOLISH

24:33.390 --> 24:34.599
PAYING YOU IN EGGS

24:34.766 --> 24:36.560
WHEN YOU GAVE US
THE CHICKENS.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.353
I'LL BRING BACK
THE BUCKET.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.439
YOU KNOW, THEY NEVER
LAID DOUBLE YOLKS FOR ME.

24:41.606 --> 24:44.818
I GUESS THAT SHOWS
WHAT A LITTLE LOVE CAN DO.

24:59.624 --> 25:03.003
OHH. LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

25:03.170 --> 25:04.963
A SURPRISE FOR SUPPER.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.756
IT'S STARTING
TO BOIL!

25:06.923 --> 25:08.925
NOT TOO LOUD.
CARRIE NEEDS HER NAP.

25:09.092 --> 25:11.052
ALL RIGHT. NOW WE'LL
PUT IT IN THE BOTTLE.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.637
WHY DO YOU
BOIL IT, MA?

25:12.804 --> 25:13.889
TO KILL THE GERMS.

25:14.055 --> 25:15.265
WHAT DO GERMS
LOOK LIKE?

25:15.432 --> 25:17.642
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.769
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY'RE THERE?

25:19.936 --> 25:21.813
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM
WITH YOUR EYE.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.441
YOU NEED A MACHINE
CALLED A MICROSCOPE.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.026
THEN IT SEEMS
REAL BIG,

25:26.193 --> 25:27.444
AND THEN
YOU CAN SEE THEM.

25:27.611 --> 25:30.530
I WISH WE HAD ONE.
I'D LOVE TO SEE A GERM.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.741
I HEAR TELL THEY'VE
GOT ONE IN MANKATO.

25:32.908 --> 25:34.326
MAYBE ONE
OF THESE DAYS

25:34.492 --> 25:35.744
YOU CAN GO SEE IT.

25:35.911 --> 25:37.454
NOW WE TEST IT.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.749
HMM. A LITTLE
TOO HOT.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.751
YOU TEST IT
ON YOUR WRIST.

25:42.918 --> 25:45.337
YOU CAN FEEL IT BEST
RIGHT THERE.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.339
MAYBE I CAN FEED
FREDDIE SOON.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.424
YOUR BROTHER'S NAME
IS CHARLES.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.468
MR. EDWARDS
CALLS HIM FREDDIE.

25:51.635 --> 25:54.095
MR. EDWARDS USES
A FEW NAMES HE SHOULDN'T.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.889
CAROLINE, YOU'RE
SPEAKING

25:56.056 --> 25:57.766
OF YOUR
SON'S GODFATHER.

25:57.933 --> 25:59.935
THAT'S BETTER.

26:04.648 --> 26:06.441
I MADE A SPECIAL
REPORT FOR SCHOOL, PA,

26:06.608 --> 26:07.859
WITH MAPS
AND EVERYTHING.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.904
WELL, LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.405
I LIKE THE COVER.

26:12.572 --> 26:15.575
WAIT TILL
YOU SEE THE MAPS.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.619
Caroline: CHARLES,
YOU HAVE To SEE THIS.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.829
HE'S HALFWAY THROUGH
ALREADY.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.332
OH, HE CAN'T BE!

26:22.499 --> 26:25.126
WELL, I JUST
DON'T BELIEVE IT.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.962
LOOK AT HIM EAT.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.588
DID I EAT
THAT FAST, MAMA?

26:28.755 --> 26:30.799
YOU ALL DID
PRETTY WELL.

26:30.966 --> 26:32.217
YOU DID
PRETTY WELL,

26:32.384 --> 26:34.261
BUT YOU'RE NOTHING
COMPARED TO HIM.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.429
HE'S GOING
TO BE A BIG BOY.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.056
BETTER TAKE
A FIRM HAND WITH HIM

26:38.223 --> 26:39.933
WHILE I STILL CAN.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.685
JUST LOOK AT HIM.

26:41.851 --> 26:42.894
YEAH.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.980
Charles: I MAY HAVE
To GET ANOTHER COW.

26:47.482 --> 26:50.068
JUST LOOK AT HIM GO!

27:32.444 --> 27:37.824
DEAR GOD, THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOUR BLESSINGS.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.409
BLESS OUR FAMILY,

27:39.576 --> 27:40.994
AND ESPECIALLY HELP

27:41.161 --> 27:43.955
MY BABY BROTHER
TO GET STRONG.

51:32.758 --> 51:34.551
SHE WAS FINE YESTERDAY,

51:34.718 --> 51:37.971
HAPPIER THAN SHE'S BEEN
SINCE THE...

51:39.389 --> 51:41.099
SINCE IT HAPPENED.

51:45.228 --> 51:48.231
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

51:48.398 --> 51:49.733
WHAT MEAN THOUGHTS?

51:49.900 --> 51:52.235
THE CHILD DOESN'T HAVE
A MEAN BONE IN HER BODY.

51:53.653 --> 51:55.530
Mary:
IT WAS WEEKS AGO.

52:00.911 --> 52:04.080
WELL, WHAT?
WHAT WAS WEEKS AGO?

52:05.373 --> 52:08.210
WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT TO TELL.

52:08.376 --> 52:13.423
MARY, PLEASE.
WHAT WAS WEEKS AGO?

52:14.716 --> 52:16.384
WELL...

52:16.551 --> 52:18.470
WHEN THE BABY
WAS SICK...

52:20.388 --> 52:21.723
AND YOU WANTED US

52:21.890 --> 52:24.017
TO SAY AN EXTRA
PRAYER...

52:25.435 --> 52:28.188
LAURA COULDN'T
DO IT.

52:30.106 --> 52:32.609
SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T CARE.

52:32.776 --> 52:35.946
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

52:40.784 --> 52:41.868
WHY, MARY?

52:42.035 --> 52:47.123
SHE SAID...
BECAUSE...

52:47.290 --> 52:50.168
ALL THAT
YOU CARED ABOUT...

52:50.335 --> 52:52.128
WAS HIM.

52:56.675 --> 52:59.135
I TOLD HER
IT WASN'T TRUE...

53:03.473 --> 53:06.476
BUT SHE GOT ANGRY...

53:07.853 --> 53:10.647
AND SAID
IT WAS TOO.

53:19.614 --> 53:21.199
I'LL GO BY WILLOW LAKE,

53:21.366 --> 53:23.493
AND I'LL STOP BY TOWN
AND SEE IF I CAN FIND HER.

53:23.660 --> 53:26.162
MARY, YOU STAY WITH YOUR
MOTHER TODAY, ALL RIGHT?

53:26.329 --> 53:28.832
DON'T YOU WORRY.
I'LL FIND HER.

53:31.126 --> 53:33.753
LAURA!

53:40.594 --> 53:41.970
LAURA!

53:50.353 --> 53:53.273
GRACE, YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN LAURA, HAVE YOU?

53:53.440 --> 53:54.941
NO. SHE'S NOT IN SCHOOL?

53:55.108 --> 53:57.027
NO. HAS EDWARDS
BEEN IN TOWN TODAY?

53:57.193 --> 53:58.695
HE STOPPED BY
THIS MORNING.

53:58.862 --> 54:00.530
PICKED UP SOME SHINGLES
OVER AT HANSON'S.

54:00.697 --> 54:02.866
GOING TO DO SOME ROOF WORK
AT AMY HEARN'S.

54:03.033 --> 54:04.284
THANK YOU.

54:09.331 --> 54:10.582
HANS?

54:10.749 --> 54:12.083
I NEED A LOAN
OF A SADDLE HORSE.

54:12.250 --> 54:13.627
THERE'S TWO
IN THE CORRAL.

54:13.793 --> 54:15.879
TAKE YOUR CHOICE.
MY SADDLE'S INSIDE.

54:16.046 --> 54:17.339
THANK YOU.

54:34.731 --> 54:37.192
Reverend Alden:
THE CLOSER YOU ARE To GOD,

54:37.359 --> 54:39.736
THE MORE
LIKELY HE IS TO LISTEN.

55:21.569 --> 55:23.863
IF YOU KNEW WHICH DIRECTION
THAT YOUNG'UN TOOK...

55:25.448 --> 55:28.785
WELL, THERE'S
NO WAY OF TELLING.

55:28.952 --> 55:31.454
HAS SHE GOT A FAVORITE
SPOT OR SOMETHING?

55:31.621 --> 55:32.914
USUALLY WHEN A KID
RUNS OFF,

55:33.081 --> 55:34.332
THEY HEAD FOR
A PLACE LIKE THAT.

55:34.499 --> 55:35.792
SHE'S ALWAYS LIKED
WILLOW LAKE.

55:35.959 --> 55:37.293
I WENT BY THERE
AND CHECKED.

55:37.460 --> 55:39.170
THERE'S NO SIGN.

55:40.422 --> 55:41.798
I JUST DON'T KNOW

55:41.965 --> 55:43.258
HOW I COULD HAVE
BEEN SO BLIND.

55:43.425 --> 55:46.261
DON'T START
BLAMING YOURSELF.

55:46.428 --> 55:48.179
WHO ELSE AM I
GOING TO BLAME?

55:49.472 --> 55:50.473
ALL THAT TIME

55:50.640 --> 55:51.725
I SPENT
WITH THE BOY...

55:51.891 --> 55:52.976
TALKING ABOUT HIM.

55:53.143 --> 55:54.811
WHY, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
WHEN YOU FIND HER,

55:54.978 --> 55:56.479
YOU'LL MAKE EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT.

55:56.646 --> 55:58.064
YOU KNOW,
IF SHE'S LIKE MOST KIDS,

55:58.231 --> 56:00.191
SHE'LL BE HOME
BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

56:01.693 --> 56:03.194
YOU THINK SO?

56:03.361 --> 56:04.446
SURE.

56:07.490 --> 56:10.452
COME ON. PICK A DIRECTION.
WE'LL START LOOKING.

56:10.618 --> 56:14.330
WELL, WE'LL DOUBLE BACK
THROUGH TOWN.

56:14.497 --> 56:15.874
CHECK AGAIN.

56:16.041 --> 56:17.500
THEN WE'LL HEAD EAST.

57:15.892 --> 57:20.563
WELL, lT'LL BE DARK
BEFORE TOO LONG.

57:20.730 --> 57:22.732
I THINK WE OUGHT TO HEAD
ON BACK TO YOUR PLACE.

57:22.899 --> 57:24.317
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
SHE'LL BE HOME BY NOW.

57:24.484 --> 57:25.985
EITHER WAY, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED LANTERNS

57:26.152 --> 57:27.904
TO KEEP LOOKING.

58:29.549 --> 58:33.761
SURE IS A LONG WAYS
UP HERE, GOD,

58:33.928 --> 58:37.807
BUT I WANTED TO GET
AS CLOSE TO YOU AS I COULD

58:37.974 --> 58:40.810
SO'S YOU COULD
HEAR ME FOR SURE.

58:40.977 --> 58:46.524
YOU SEE, THE REVEREND
ALDEN--YOU KNOW HIM.

58:46.691 --> 58:49.485
WELL, HE TOLD ME
YOU COULD HELP ME.

58:49.652 --> 58:54.490
YOU SEE, GOD, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO PRAY FOR MY BROTHER

58:54.657 --> 58:58.203
SO'S HE WOULD BE
ALL RIGHT AGAIN, AND...

58:59.871 --> 59:02.290
WELL, I DIDN'T DO IT.

59:02.457 --> 59:05.627
I HAD MEAN THOUGHTS...

59:05.793 --> 59:09.005
BUT I TRIED TO TELL YOU
LATER THAT I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

59:09.172 --> 59:12.425
I REALLY DID WANT HIM
TO BE ALL RIGHT AGAIN,

59:12.592 --> 59:14.385
BUT I GUESS
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME.

59:16.804 --> 59:18.598
SO NOW I WANT
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

59:20.892 --> 59:22.185
YOU SEE, GOD,

59:22.352 --> 59:29.651
MY PA HAS 3 GIRLS--
ME AND MARY AND CARRIE--

59:29.817 --> 59:32.528
AND WHAT HE REALLY NEEDS
IS A BOY...

59:32.695 --> 59:34.280
LIKE YOU HAD, GOD.

59:36.199 --> 59:38.076
SO WHAT I WAS
WONDERING IS...

59:40.203 --> 59:41.913
SINCE YOU HAVE A SON,

59:42.080 --> 59:44.415
MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE
A LITTLE GIRL WITH YOU,

59:44.582 --> 59:47.001
AND YOU COULD SEND
MY BROTHER BACK TO PA.

59:51.589 --> 59:53.508
WELL, THAT'S ABOUT IT.

59:53.675 --> 59:55.635
I'LL JUST WAIT RIGHT HERE.

1:00:01.766 --> 1:00:03.268
AMEN.

1:00:23.413 --> 1:00:25.915
HERE'S THE EXTRA CANTEEN
AND SOME FOOD.

1:00:26.082 --> 1:00:27.166
GOOD.

1:00:34.090 --> 1:00:35.758
RUNNING SHORT
OF KEROSENE.

1:00:38.094 --> 1:00:39.137
ALL SET?

1:00:39.304 --> 1:00:40.722
YEAH.

1:00:42.098 --> 1:00:43.474
LET'S GO.

1:00:49.939 --> 1:00:52.108
[HOOFBEATS RECEDING]

1:01:15.590 --> 1:01:17.175
Man: SLEEP WELL?

1:01:30.146 --> 1:01:32.315
CAN'T YOU SPEAK,
CHILD?

1:01:37.653 --> 1:01:38.654
WHERE AM I?

1:01:38.821 --> 1:01:40.615
DON'T YOU KNOW?

1:01:43.826 --> 1:01:46.329
I'M NOT SURE.

1:01:46.496 --> 1:01:48.206
YOU'RE ON MY MOUNTAIN--

1:01:48.373 --> 1:01:49.749
JONATHAN'S MOUNTAIN.

1:01:49.916 --> 1:01:53.127
OH. WHO ARE YOU?

1:01:53.294 --> 1:01:54.754
WELL, I JUST TOLD YOU.

1:01:54.921 --> 1:01:57.882
YOU'RE ON MY MOUNTAIN.
I'M JONATHAN.

1:02:00.218 --> 1:02:03.262
THEN YOU'RE JUST A MAN.

1:02:03.429 --> 1:02:05.223
WELL, WHO ARE YOU?

1:02:05.390 --> 1:02:06.933
LAURA.

1:02:07.100 --> 1:02:08.976
LAURA.

1:02:09.143 --> 1:02:11.104
WELL, LITTLE LAURA,
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

1:02:15.858 --> 1:02:17.860
I WAS JUST TAKING
A TRIP, IS ALL.

1:02:18.027 --> 1:02:20.530
OH.

1:02:20.696 --> 1:02:22.073
WELL, YOU SHOULD BRING
SOME WARM THINGS

1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:24.117
WITH YOU ON A JOURNEY.

1:02:24.283 --> 1:02:26.202
WHERE YOU BOUND FOR?

1:02:28.246 --> 1:02:30.623
I'M NOT SURE YET.

1:02:30.790 --> 1:02:32.875
OH, SORT OF
AN ADVENTURE, EH?

1:02:33.042 --> 1:02:34.335
YES, SIR.

1:02:34.502 --> 1:02:36.796
WELL, THOSE JOURNEYS
ARE THE BEST.

1:02:36.963 --> 1:02:38.714
I GOT SOME
HOT PORRIDGE ON.

1:02:38.881 --> 1:02:40.758
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

1:02:40.925 --> 1:02:42.051
NO, THANK YOU.

1:02:42.218 --> 1:02:44.387
YOU SURE?

1:02:44.554 --> 1:02:47.515
I THINK I WILL.

1:02:50.893 --> 1:02:52.770
OH, I LOVE
WARM PORRIDGE

1:02:52.937 --> 1:02:54.272
IN MY BODY.

1:02:54.439 --> 1:02:56.649
I WAS TELLING HIM
THIS MORNING,

1:02:56.816 --> 1:02:59.527
COLD NIGHTS MAKE
HOT PORRIDGE A JOY,

1:02:59.694 --> 1:03:02.738
A PURE JOY. HA HA!

1:03:02.905 --> 1:03:05.199
YES, HE THOUGHT
IT WAS FUNNY,

1:03:05.366 --> 1:03:07.618
BUT HE HAD TO AGREE.

1:03:07.785 --> 1:03:09.412
I THINK SOMETIMES
EVEN HE'S SURPRISED

1:03:09.579 --> 1:03:11.622
AT HOW WE FEEL
ABOUT THINGS.

1:03:11.789 --> 1:03:13.708
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1:03:16.085 --> 1:03:18.004
WELL, GOD, OF COURSE.

1:03:21.716 --> 1:03:22.842
ARE YOU SURE

1:03:23.009 --> 1:03:24.510
YOU DON'T WANT
SOME PORRIDGE?

1:03:24.677 --> 1:03:26.012
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1:03:37.523 --> 1:03:39.275
YOU KNOW GOD?

1:03:40.735 --> 1:03:42.778
WELL, OF COURSE.

1:03:42.945 --> 1:03:44.155
WE ALL DO--

1:03:44.322 --> 1:03:46.574
SOME SOONER,
SOME LATER.

1:03:46.741 --> 1:03:49.827
BUT HE TALKS TO YOU.

1:03:49.994 --> 1:03:52.830
WELL, WHEN HE HAS TIME.

1:03:52.997 --> 1:03:54.248
WHY?

1:03:56.876 --> 1:04:00.546
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I'M HERE.

1:04:00.713 --> 1:04:02.507
TO TALK TO GOD,
I MEAN.

1:04:02.673 --> 1:04:05.343
WELL, YOU COULDN'T HAVE
PICKED A BETTER PLACE.

1:04:05.510 --> 1:04:07.470
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,

1:04:07.637 --> 1:04:08.971
BUT I TALKED
TO HIM LAST NIGHT,

1:04:09.138 --> 1:04:10.765
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.

1:04:12.016 --> 1:04:14.936
OH, I SEE.

1:04:15.102 --> 1:04:18.189
WELL, YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND,

1:04:18.356 --> 1:04:20.024
HE'S GOT
A LOT TO DO.

1:04:20.191 --> 1:04:21.609
I MEAN, THERE'S
SO MANY PEOPLE

1:04:21.776 --> 1:04:23.361
HE HAS TO LISTEN TO

1:04:23.528 --> 1:04:25.571
AND WELL, UH...

1:04:25.738 --> 1:04:27.073
DIDN'T YOU EVER
GET BEHIND

1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:28.241
IN YOUR CHORES--

1:04:28.407 --> 1:04:29.784
I MEAN, TO WHERE
IT TOOK YOU DAYS

1:04:29.951 --> 1:04:31.160
TO CATCH UP?

1:04:31.327 --> 1:04:32.578
YEAH.

1:04:32.745 --> 1:04:34.205
WELL,
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

1:04:34.372 --> 1:04:36.958
GOD'S JUST PROBABLY
RUNNING BEHIND.

1:04:37.124 --> 1:04:39.168
YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT IT IS?

1:04:39.335 --> 1:04:41.212
I'D BET ON IT.
HA HA HA!

1:04:41.379 --> 1:04:43.673
YOU JUST HAVE
TO BE PATIENT.

1:04:43.839 --> 1:04:45.341
HOW ABOUT
SOME PORRIDGE?

1:04:45.508 --> 1:04:46.676
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
WAIT FOR GOD

1:04:46.842 --> 1:04:48.511
ON A FULL STOMACH
AS ON AN EMPTY ONE,

1:04:48.678 --> 1:04:49.679
HUH?

1:04:49.845 --> 1:04:52.515
BESIDES, HE DOESN'T
LIKE HIS CHILDREN

1:04:52.682 --> 1:04:54.141
TO WASTE GOOD FOOD,
DOES HE?

1:04:54.308 --> 1:04:55.851
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

1:04:56.018 --> 1:04:57.103
YEAH.

1:05:04.610 --> 1:05:06.362
GOOD?

1:05:06.529 --> 1:05:07.947
MMM-

1:05:23.421 --> 1:05:25.423
WELL,
HORSES ARE RESTED.

1:05:25.590 --> 1:05:27.967
WE CAN MOVE OUT
ANYTIME.

1:05:29.969 --> 1:05:31.679
WE'VE COVERED
A LOT OF MILES

1:05:31.846 --> 1:05:33.180
IN THIS DIRECTION.

1:05:33.347 --> 1:05:34.932
SHE COULDN'T HAVE
COME THIS FAR ON FOOT.

1:05:35.099 --> 1:05:36.601
I THINK WE OUGHT
TO DOUBLE BACK,

1:05:36.767 --> 1:05:38.436
STOP AT YOUR PLACE
JUST IN CASE,

1:05:38.603 --> 1:05:40.396
AND THEN HEAD OUT
AGAIN.

1:05:42.231 --> 1:05:43.983
IT WAS COLD LAST NIGHT...

1:05:46.402 --> 1:05:48.404
COLD A NIGHT
AS WE'VE HAD LATELY.

1:05:50.239 --> 1:05:52.408
COULD FEEL THE WIND
THROUGH MY COAT.

1:05:54.201 --> 1:05:56.996
EH, IT DIDN'T SEEM
THAT BAD TO ME.

1:05:59.206 --> 1:06:01.417
LAURA DIDN'T EVEN BRING
HER LITTLE COAT WITH HER.

1:06:03.753 --> 1:06:05.504
HOW MANY TIMES CAROLINE
AND I HAVE TOLD THAT CHILD

1:06:05.671 --> 1:06:07.423
TO BUNDLE UP...

1:06:09.675 --> 1:06:11.469
HOW MANY TIMES...

1:06:14.138 --> 1:06:15.931
CHARLES?

1:06:16.974 --> 1:06:18.976
CHARLES?

1:06:19.143 --> 1:06:21.020
COME ON.
IT'S TIME TO GO.

1:06:55.596 --> 1:06:57.431
PATIENCE, CHILD.

1:06:57.598 --> 1:06:58.808
I CAN'T HELP IT.

1:06:58.974 --> 1:07:02.770
PA SAYS CHILDREN AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY.

1:07:02.937 --> 1:07:06.232
YOUR PA SEEMS LIKE
A BRIGHT MAN.

1:07:06.399 --> 1:07:07.983
OH, HE IS.

1:07:08.150 --> 1:07:09.360
SO'S MY MA.

1:07:09.527 --> 1:07:11.404
SHE USED TO BE
A SCHOOLTEACHER,

1:07:11.570 --> 1:07:13.531
AND SHE KNOWS
A BUNCH OF STUFF.

1:07:14.657 --> 1:07:16.200
YOU'RE PRETTY FOND
OF YOUR FOLKS,

1:07:16.367 --> 1:07:18.119
AREN'T YOU?

1:07:18.285 --> 1:07:19.495
SURE.

1:07:19.662 --> 1:07:21.706
EVERYBODY LOVES
THEIR MA AND PA.

1:07:23.916 --> 1:07:25.710
THEN HOW COME
YOU RUN OFF?

1:07:27.545 --> 1:07:29.296
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

1:07:31.006 --> 1:07:32.717
FAIR ENOUGH.

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:41.016
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU,
MR. JONATHAN,

1:07:41.183 --> 1:07:43.185
BUT IT'S JUST BETWEEN
ME AND GOD.

1:07:43.352 --> 1:07:45.104
I UNDERSTAND.

1:07:47.690 --> 1:07:49.316
LOOK HERE.

1:07:49.483 --> 1:07:51.360
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1:07:51.527 --> 1:07:53.612
NOW, LOOK AT IT
REAL CLOSE.

1:07:57.992 --> 1:08:00.035
IT HAS MY NAME ON IT!

1:08:00.202 --> 1:08:01.620
WHY, SURE.
I MADE IT FOR YOU.

1:08:01.787 --> 1:08:03.456
OH, THANK YOU.

1:08:05.583 --> 1:08:08.169
IT'S A FINE CROSS.

1:08:08.335 --> 1:08:09.754
I FIGURE IT WON'T
HURT NONE

1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:11.297
TO HAVE IT
AROUND YOUR NECK

1:08:11.464 --> 1:08:12.882
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
TO HIM.

1:08:13.048 --> 1:08:14.592
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

1:08:14.759 --> 1:08:16.969
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

1:08:17.136 --> 1:08:18.262
NOW, COME ALONG.

1:08:18.429 --> 1:08:20.389
WE'LL GO DOWN BY
THE RIVER AND WASH UP

1:08:20.556 --> 1:08:21.891
AND DRINK DEEP
OF HEAVEN'S TEARS.

1:08:22.057 --> 1:08:23.476
HEAVEN'S TEARS?

1:08:23.642 --> 1:08:25.186
UH-HUH.

1:08:25.352 --> 1:08:26.896
BUT I CAN'T!

1:08:27.062 --> 1:08:30.149
HE MIGHT LOOK AND I'M
GONE. I MIGHT MISS HIM!

1:08:30.316 --> 1:08:32.777
OH, WELL, NOW,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

1:08:32.943 --> 1:08:36.447
LOOK AT THE SUN.
HEY, IT MUST BE NOON--

1:08:36.614 --> 1:08:38.199

THE LORD'S REST.

1:08:38.365 --> 1:08:39.784
HA HA HA!

1:08:39.950 --> 1:08:41.577
HE WON'T BE UP FROM
HIS NAP

1:08:41.744 --> 1:08:43.370
FOR A COUPLE
OF HOURS YET.

1:08:43.537 --> 1:08:44.747
GOD TAKES A NAP?

1:08:44.914 --> 1:08:46.207
WHY, SURE.

1:08:46.373 --> 1:08:48.918
I DIDN'T THINK
HE EVER GOT TIRED.

1:08:49.084 --> 1:08:50.586
OH, MY, YES.

1:08:50.753 --> 1:08:52.046
WHAT WITH
ALL THOSE PEOPLE

1:08:52.213 --> 1:08:53.255
ASKING FOR THINGS

1:08:53.422 --> 1:08:54.548
AND GETTING INTO
TROUBLE AND ALL,

1:08:54.715 --> 1:08:57.635

A MIGHTY BIG JOB.

1:08:57.802 --> 1:08:59.887

A LOT ABOUT GOD.

1:09:02.014 --> 1:09:04.517

NOW, COME ALONG.

1:09:36.799 --> 1:09:38.843
WHY DO YOU CALL IT
HEAVEN'S TEARS?

1:09:40.636 --> 1:09:42.388
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT RAIN IS,

1:09:42.555 --> 1:09:44.682
AND RAIN MAKES
THE RIVER.

1:09:44.849 --> 1:09:47.685
YOU SEE, WHEN
THE FOLKS IN HEAVEN

1:09:47.852 --> 1:09:49.019

SOME OF THE THINGS

1:09:49.186 --> 1:09:52.314
THAT HAPPEN DOWN HERE,
THEY CRY.

1:09:52.481 --> 1:09:53.941
MAKES SENSE,
DOESN'T IT?

1:09:54.108 --> 1:09:55.651
WHEN YOU TELL IT,
IT DOES.

1:09:55.818 --> 1:09:57.903
[CHUCKLES]

1:09:58.070 --> 1:10:00.239
AND WHEN THE SUN
COMES OUT,

1:10:00.406 --> 1:10:02.408
HEAVEN'S HAPPY,
RIGHT?

1:10:02.575 --> 1:10:03.784
RIGHT.

1:10:03.951 --> 1:10:07.037
I WISH IT WOULD
NEVER RAIN AGAIN.

1:10:07.204 --> 1:10:08.914
OH, WELL, NOW,
HOLD ON.

1:10:09.081 --> 1:10:12.042
THAT'S ONE OF GOD'S
LESSONS FOR US.

1:10:12.209 --> 1:10:14.295
SEE, WHEN HEAVEN CRIES

1:10:14.461 --> 1:10:16.255
AND THE TEARS
COME DOWN,

1:10:16.422 --> 1:10:20.050
IT MAKES THINGS GROW
AND COME ALIVE AGAIN.

1:10:20.217 --> 1:10:22.720
WHAT GOD WANTS US
TO KNOW IS THAT

1:10:22.887 --> 1:10:24.346
IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO CARE

1:10:24.513 --> 1:10:26.515
AND CRY FOR
YOUR FELLOW MAN.

1:10:26.682 --> 1:10:28.309
BECAUSE IF YOU DO,

1:10:28.475 --> 1:10:31.145
ONLY GOOD CAN
COME OF IT.

1:10:31.312 --> 1:10:33.272
DID YOU EVER CRY,
JONATHAN?

1:10:36.025 --> 1:10:40.195
MANY TIMES, CHILD.
MANY TIMES.

1:10:48.704 --> 1:10:51.290
WELL, NOW. LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT THOSE EARS.

1:10:51.457 --> 1:10:53.292
I SCRUBBED THEM
HARD.

AHH. OH, MY.

1:11:00.132 --> 1:11:02.092
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE
ON THE INSIDE,

1:11:02.259 --> 1:11:05.429
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
HE MIGHT CHECK BEHIND THEM.

1:11:05.596 --> 1:11:07.139
I ALMOST FORGOT
ABOUT THAT.

1:11:07.306 --> 1:11:10.392
UH-HUH.
BACK IN YOU GO.

1:11:10.559 --> 1:11:12.728
I'LL GET GOOD
THIS TIME.

1:11:12.895 --> 1:11:14.355
I PROMISE.

1:11:14.521 --> 1:11:16.982
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

1:11:17.149 --> 1:11:21.028
RUB THEM GOOD.
OH, RUB THEM.

1:11:21.195 --> 1:11:23.572
RUB THEM TILL
THEY COME OFF!

1:11:33.582 --> 1:11:35.250
MY CROSS!

1:11:42.424 --> 1:11:44.593
CAREFUL, CHILD.

1:11:56.605 --> 1:11:58.565
MY CROSS.

1:11:59.817 --> 1:12:02.653
IT'S GONE.

1:12:02.820 --> 1:12:04.613
IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT, LAURA.

1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:07.074
I SHOULD'VE USED
A STRONGER THREAD.

1:12:07.241 --> 1:12:08.701
I'LL MAKE ANOTHER.

1:12:28.804 --> 1:12:30.431

1:12:54.163 --> 1:12:56.498
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
HURT HIS WING.

1:12:56.665 --> 1:12:58.333
WILL IT DIE?

1:12:58.500 --> 1:13:00.252
WELL, NOT IF SOMEBODY
CARES FOR IT.

1:13:00.419 --> 1:13:02.755
NURSES IT
BACK TO HEALTH.

1:13:02.921 --> 1:13:04.173
I'LL DO IT.

1:13:04.339 --> 1:13:05.716
I'LL BRING HIM
BACK WITH US.

1:13:05.883 --> 1:13:08.469
OH, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

1:13:08.635 --> 1:13:09.928
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1:13:10.095 --> 1:13:11.847
MM-HMM.
AND JUST THINK--

1:13:12.014 --> 1:13:13.474
IF THE CROSS HADN'T
FLOATED AWAY,

1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:15.642
WE NEVER WOULD'VE
FOUND HIM.

1:13:18.228 --> 1:13:20.522
IT'S ALMOST
LIKE WHAT YOU SAID--

1:13:20.689 --> 1:13:23.358
ABOUT TEARS MAKING
THINGS COME ALIVE AGAIN.

To THE ARDEN RIVER

1:13:58.769 --> 1:14:00.354
AND THEN GO WEST
FROM THERE.

1:14:00.521 --> 1:14:02.356
Carrie:
WHERE'S LAURA?

1:14:02.523 --> 1:14:04.316
SHE WENT AWAY
FOR A WHILE.

1:14:04.483 --> 1:14:07.027
WHERE?

1:14:07.194 --> 1:14:08.821
SHE JUST WENT
SOMEWHERE.

1:14:08.987 --> 1:14:10.906
DID SHE GO
WITH MY BROTHER?

1:14:14.910 --> 1:14:17.079
LET'S GO.

1:14:53.323 --> 1:14:55.075
DO YOU THINK
HE'S WARM ENOUGH?

1:14:55.242 --> 1:14:58.120
OH, LIKE CORN BREAD
IN THE OVEN.

1:14:58.287 --> 1:14:59.621
HOW ABOUT YOU?

1:14:59.788 --> 1:15:01.540
LIKE CORN BREAD.

1:15:07.379 --> 1:15:09.173
I HOPE IT'S TONIGHT.

1:15:11.633 --> 1:15:13.177
COULD BE.

1:15:17.306 --> 1:15:19.975
I WONDER IF GOD WOULD MIND
IF I TOLD YOU.

1:15:22.519 --> 1:15:25.314
YOU MEAN WHAT YOU WERE
TALKING TO HIM ABOUT?

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:26.982
YEAH.

1:15:28.150 --> 1:15:30.277
NO. I DON'T THINK
HE'D MIND.

1:15:32.571 --> 1:15:35.574
WELL, YOU KNOWING HIM
SO WELL AND ALL,

1:15:35.741 --> 1:15:37.701
I FIGURED YOU COULD
TELL ME FOR SURE

1:15:37.868 --> 1:15:39.995
WHETHER HE COULD DO
WHAT I'M ASKING.

1:15:42.039 --> 1:15:45.209
WELL, I--
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO.

1:15:46.418 --> 1:15:48.337
WELL, THE SHORT
OF IT IS,

1:15:48.503 --> 1:15:51.256
I WANT TO MAKE KIND OF
A TRADE DEAL WITH GOD

1:15:51.423 --> 1:15:52.841
SO AS I COULD BE WITH HIM

1:15:53.008 --> 1:15:55.886
AND MY BROTHER COULD COME
BACK AND BE WITH MY PA.

1:15:56.053 --> 1:15:58.889
PA WANTS A SON REAL BAD.

1:15:59.056 --> 1:16:01.391
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.

1:16:04.353 --> 1:16:05.646
HMM.

1:16:07.356 --> 1:16:09.524
WELL, THAT'S
A PRETTY BIG ORDER.

1:16:09.691 --> 1:16:12.277
BUT GOD CAN DO ANYTHING.

1:16:12.444 --> 1:16:14.696
WELL,
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH.

1:16:14.863 --> 1:16:16.531
OH, HE CAN DO IT,
ALL RIGHT,

1:16:16.698 --> 1:16:19.368
IF THAT'S WHAT
HE THINKS IS BEST.

1:16:19.534 --> 1:16:20.827
OH, IT IS.

1:16:20.994 --> 1:16:22.329
I EXPLAINED TO HIM

1:16:22.496 --> 1:16:24.081
ABOUT MY HAVING
MEAN THOUGHTS AND ALL,

1:16:24.248 --> 1:16:27.459
AND I GUESS THAT'S WHY
HE TOOK MY BROTHER...

1:16:27.626 --> 1:16:29.962
KIND OF BY MISTAKE
BECAUSE OF ME.

1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:34.758
MY BROTHER COULDN'T HAVE
ANY MEAN THOUGHTS.

1:16:34.925 --> 1:16:37.010
HE WAS TOO LITTLE.

1:16:37.177 --> 1:16:39.346
WELL, NOW, DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ANY DIFFERENT

1:16:39.513 --> 1:16:41.265
FROM OTHER FOLKS.

1:16:41.431 --> 1:16:43.141
I MEAN, EVERYBODY
HAS A MEAN THOUGHT

1:16:43.308 --> 1:16:44.977
ONCE IN A WHILE.

1:16:45.143 --> 1:16:46.645
NOT MY MA AND PA.

1:16:46.812 --> 1:16:49.022
WELL, MAYBE JUST
A LITTLE ONE,

1:16:49.189 --> 1:16:51.275
BUT THE IMPORTANT
THING IS THAT YOU

1:16:51.441 --> 1:16:53.235
MAKE THINGS RIGHT--

1:16:53.402 --> 1:16:56.738
THAT YOU DO GOOD THINGS
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT,

LIKE TAKING CARE
OF THAT LITTLE BIRD.

1:16:59.783 --> 1:17:01.702
NOW, SOME FOLKS
WOULD JUST WALK ON BY

1:17:01.868 --> 1:17:03.453
AND NOT DO A THING.

1:17:03.620 --> 1:17:04.913

ABOUT ANOTHER OF
GOD'S CREATURES.

ABOUT THEMSELVES.

1:17:38.196 --> 1:17:40.324

BEING SAD JUST LIKE PEOPLE.

WORKS OUT ALL RIGHT,

1:25:09.773 --> 1:25:11.941
YEAH, WHAT?

1:25:12.108 --> 1:25:13.359
HMM...

1:25:21.659 --> 1:25:23.161
FIRST OF ALL, WE GOT

1:25:23.328 --> 1:25:24.913
TO GET THE LORD'S
ATTENTION, RIGHT?

1:25:25.079 --> 1:25:25.914
RIGHT.

1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:27.582
RIGHT.

1:25:27.749 --> 1:25:29.584
THEN WE NEED
TO DO SOMETHING

1:25:29.751 --> 1:25:32.253
THAT HE CAN SEE
CLEAR UP TO HEAVEN.

1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:34.130
BUT WHAT?

1:25:34.297 --> 1:25:38.051
UH...I'VE GOT IT!

1:25:38.218 --> 1:25:40.470
A FIRE.
A GREAT BIG FIRE!

1:25:40.637 --> 1:25:42.263
NOT JUST
A LITTLE CAMPFIRE,

1:25:42.430 --> 1:25:43.807
BUT A GREAT BIG FIRE.

1:25:43.973 --> 1:25:45.934
HE'S BOUND TO SEE THAT.

1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:47.894
THAT'S IT, JONATHAN,
A FIRE!

1:25:48.061 --> 1:25:49.312
HA! COME ON, HONEY.

1:25:49.479 --> 1:25:50.605
WE GOT A LOT OF
FIREWOOD TO GATHER

1:25:50.772 --> 1:25:52.398
'CAUSE WE GOT TO
KEEP THAT FIRE GOING

1:25:52.565 --> 1:25:54.275
UNTIL HE ANSWERS YOU.

1:25:54.442 --> 1:25:56.569
HE'S GOT TO ANSWER
THIS TIME, JONATHAN.

1:25:56.736 --> 1:25:57.862
HE'S JUST GOT TO!

1:25:58.029 --> 1:26:01.574
HE WILL. YOU TAKE
JONATHAN'S WORD FOR IT.

1:26:01.741 --> 1:26:03.535
HE WILL.

1:26:03.701 --> 1:26:05.036
COME ON.
HA HA HA!

1:26:25.557 --> 1:26:27.058
Edwards: INGALLS!

1:26:32.981 --> 1:26:35.024
WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT?

1:26:40.363 --> 1:26:42.448
COME ON!

1:27:02.886 --> 1:27:05.680
HE'S BOUND TO SEE IT.

1:27:05.847 --> 1:27:08.516
HE MUST BE WATCHING US NOW.

1:27:08.683 --> 1:27:11.519
HE IS.
GO TALK TO HIM, CHILD.

1:28:16.542 --> 1:28:18.503
Charles: Too STEEP
FOR THE HORSES.

1:28:38.815 --> 1:28:41.192
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

1:28:41.359 --> 1:28:44.779
IT WOULD MAKE MY PA
SO HAPPY AND ME, TOO.

1:28:44.946 --> 1:28:47.865
I'M RIGHT UP HERE
BY THE BIG FIRE,

1:28:48.032 --> 1:28:51.536
SO PLEASE, GOD,
ANSWER ME.

1:28:51.703 --> 1:28:53.162
AMEN.

1:28:59.877 --> 1:29:01.421
Charles: LAURA!

1:29:13.141 --> 1:29:15.268
LAURA!

1:29:15.435 --> 1:29:16.602
LAURA!

1:29:21.899 --> 1:29:23.067
LAURA!

1:29:31.868 --> 1:29:34.203
[WHISPERING]
Pa...

1:29:34.370 --> 1:29:36.914
No, Pa, no.

1:29:50.219 --> 1:29:51.637
NO, CHILD. NO...

1:29:51.804 --> 1:29:53.514
LET ME GO, PLEASE.

1:29:53.681 --> 1:29:55.141
I DON'T WANT PA
TO FIND ME

1:29:55.308 --> 1:29:56.559
UNTIL GOD ANSWERS.

1:29:56.726 --> 1:29:57.810
HE HAS ANSWERED.

1:29:57.977 --> 1:29:59.395
NO, HE HASN'T.

1:29:59.562 --> 1:30:03.357
HE HAS ANSWERED, AND HE'S
MADE HIS DECISION.

1:30:03.524 --> 1:30:04.859
THAT'S WHY
HE SENT YOUR PA.

1:30:05.026 --> 1:30:06.944
HE WANTS YOU TO BE
WITH YOUR PA

1:30:07.111 --> 1:30:08.696
AND YOUR BROTHER
TO BE WITH HIM.

1:30:08.863 --> 1:30:10.364
THAT ISN'T
WHAT I WANTED.

1:30:10.531 --> 1:30:11.657
PA WANTS A SON.

1:30:11.824 --> 1:30:16.496
NO, CHILD. THAT'S WHAT
YOU THOUGHT HE WANTED.

1:30:16.662 --> 1:30:21.375
ONLY GOD KNOWS BEST
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

1:30:21.542 --> 1:30:25.213
THAT'S WHY HE SENT
YOUR PA HERE,

1:30:25.379 --> 1:30:27.298
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
THAT YOUR PA LOVES YOU

1:30:27.465 --> 1:30:29.133
AND NEEDS YOU.

1:30:29.300 --> 1:30:31.427
HOW ELSE COULD YOUR FATHER
HAVE FOUND YOU?

1:30:36.557 --> 1:30:38.768
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

1:30:41.979 --> 1:30:43.773
HE TOLD ME, CHILD.

1:30:54.575 --> 1:30:56.285
GO TO HIM, LAURA.

1:31:16.139 --> 1:31:21.102
Pa...oh, Pa...

1:31:40.204 --> 1:31:41.831
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1:31:43.583 --> 1:31:46.961
WHY? WHY DID
YOU DO IT?

1:31:47.128 --> 1:31:50.173
I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED
CHARLES MORE THAN ME.

1:31:51.132 --> 1:31:53.301
HOW COULD YOU
THINK THAT?

1:31:53.467 --> 1:31:55.178
I JUST DID.

1:31:56.637 --> 1:31:58.556
I'M SORRY.

1:32:03.186 --> 1:32:05.521
I'M SO SORRY.
IT WAS MY FAULT.

1:32:07.648 --> 1:32:10.443
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

1:32:10.610 --> 1:32:12.945
GOD WANTS ME
TO BE WITH YOU.

1:32:13.112 --> 1:32:15.740
HE TOLD JONATHAN.

1:32:15.907 --> 1:32:17.200
JONATHAN?

1:32:17.366 --> 1:32:19.785
HE WAS RIGHT HERE.
JONATHAN?

1:32:23.289 --> 1:32:24.999
JONATHAN?

1:32:30.588 --> 1:32:32.215
JONATHAN!

1:32:35.009 --> 1:32:36.594
JONATHAN?

1:32:42.516 --> 1:32:44.018
JONATHAN?

1:32:52.151 --> 1:32:53.361
JONATHAN!

1:32:58.157 --> 1:33:00.785
HE WAS JUST HERE.

1:33:00.952 --> 1:33:03.621
WHY WOULD HE GO?

1:33:03.788 --> 1:33:06.290
HE TOOK CARE OF ME.

1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:22.640
THE BIRD'S GONE, TOO.

1:33:34.735 --> 1:33:36.570
DID HE GIVE YOU THIS?

1:33:38.739 --> 1:33:41.659
MY CROSS.

1:33:41.826 --> 1:33:43.911
JONATHAN MADE IT FOR ME.

1:33:44.078 --> 1:33:46.289
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

1:33:48.374 --> 1:33:50.626
MILES DOWN THE RIVER.

1:33:55.339 --> 1:33:58.426
HEAVEN'S TEARS.

1:33:58.592 --> 1:34:00.970
WHAT?

1:34:01.137 --> 1:34:02.972
SOMETHING
JONATHAN TOLD ME.

1:34:05.057 --> 1:34:07.435
GOD TALKED TO HIM, PA.

1:34:07.601 --> 1:34:09.562
HE REALLY DID.

1:34:19.780 --> 1:34:21.907
LET'S GO HOME.
