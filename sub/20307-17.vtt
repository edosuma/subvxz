WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:05.922
FRANK: Forgive me, Graham,
but that's damn nonsense,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.966
and I won't be a party to it.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.718
I'm not angry.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.845
I'm sure that you do.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.097
(sighs) Fine. Sure.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.890
Talk to you soon.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.435
What did Graham have in mind?

00:18.518 --> 00:20.186
Press coverage of my returning to work.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.564
Even without a media entourage,

00:22.647 --> 00:24.399
I'm not so sure going back to work

00:24.482 --> 00:26.985
after only three weeks
is such a hot idea, Furillo.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.236
I'll take it easy.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.947
You know, I would give you
more of an argument

00:31.031 --> 00:32.949
if you weren't so restless at home.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.328
Have I been a lousy patient?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.707
We were very glad to have you.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.421
Cold cuts in the refrigerator for lunch
if you change your mind.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.840
-Thank you.
-Easy does it, Furillo.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.051
Easy does it.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.514
(inhales deeply)

00:58.683 --> 01:01.144
Item seven: assignments and operations.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.314
Lieutenant Buntz is gonna be
taking a personal day today.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.858
He's gonna be on a TV show.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.444
Yeah, he was witness to an accident,

01:09.527 --> 01:10.904
and instead of going to court,

01:10.987 --> 01:12.655
they're gonna settle it on television.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.117
This I gotta see. Buntz is gonna be on TV?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.078
Lieutenant's on "Tell it to the Judge"?

01:18.161 --> 01:20.246
-(laughter)
-He says that they're taping today,

01:20.330 --> 01:22.248
but it's not gonna be on
for a couple of months,

01:22.332 --> 01:24.209
I guess. Well, anyway, the point is

01:24.292 --> 01:26.044
that Detective Snelker is replacing

01:26.127 --> 01:29.089
the Lieutenant
at the Koppleman Hardware stakeout.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.800
Marshall and Reeser
are at the Hubba-Hubba Lounge,

01:31.883 --> 01:33.343
116 and Jerome.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.137
Mick Belker is at Nicholson's Loan Mart,

01:36.221 --> 01:39.307
where we got reports
they're buying stolen property.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.226
Here's a last, personal item.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.979
Captain Furillo is threatening
to come back to work today.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.648
-(cheering)
-MAN: All right!

01:46.731 --> 01:48.024
Now, people,

01:48.108 --> 01:50.944
people let's be aware
that this is an individual

01:51.027 --> 01:54.614
recuperating
from major surgery 21 days ago.

01:55.323 --> 01:58.535
Now, I'm not suggesting
that all approaches be cleared through me,

01:58.618 --> 02:00.745
but let's use our heads.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.831
Captain's always had an open-door policy,

02:02.914 --> 02:05.917
but let's be bright
about not overusing it.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.085
Okay.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.046
All right, item eight:

02:10.505 --> 02:12.507
possible new vehicles.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.300
(cheering)

02:14.384 --> 02:17.595
This is one test unit.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.974
It's being loaned
to the department for trial use.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.517
Well, boy howdy anyway.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.186
I'd assigned it to you and Hill, Andy.
What's the matter?

02:25.270 --> 02:27.480
-Is Bobby sick or something?
-No, he's late for work.

02:28.439 --> 02:32.527
Okay, Hill and Renko get it
for trial operation today.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.905
Now, these trials are going on
throughout the department,

02:35.989 --> 02:38.449
and assuming that the returns are good,

02:38.533 --> 02:41.452
maybe we'll all have new units
on the road by spring.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.788
-HENRY: Stan, excuse me, Stan?
-Okay, that's it.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.874
-Let's have a safe shift.
-Stan? Stan?

02:45.957 --> 02:47.250
Wait a minute. Lieutenant?

02:47.333 --> 02:49.794
People, poker isn't gonna work
at my place tonight.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.796
I got a little plumbing problem.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.883
-(laughter, groaning)
-Hey, casa Coffey.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.676
I pay for refreshments.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.761
If you're coming there
to kibbitz, go to a movie.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.597
-Same time, Joseph?
-Yeah.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.266
Okay, poker at 7:30 at Joe Coffey's.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.685
Now let's go.
They're getting away out there.

03:05.768 --> 03:06.644
(chattering)

03:07.812 --> 03:09.522
You know any good plumbers, Howard?

03:10.064 --> 03:12.609
Without tooting my own trumpet, Henry,

03:12.692 --> 03:15.445
I must confess that I'm rather handy
at household repairs.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.238
I handle all those chores myself.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.823
-So that's a "no."
-Hmm.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.826
You know, I wonder if any research
has ever been done

03:21.910 --> 03:25.079
on your tribe's extreme ineptitude
in that whole area.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.247
What whole area?

03:26.331 --> 03:29.042
Oh, you know, cleanup, paint up, fix up.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.043
It's a myth, Howard.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.128
Holds as much water
as any other stereotype.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.174
-Sorry I'm late, Renko, traffic.
-We get to test-drive a new unit.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.967
-You shaved off your mustache.
-Yeah.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.136
Hey, Bobby, the poker game's
at my place tonight.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.014
-I thought it was Goldblume's turn.
-He's got problems with his plumbing.

03:43.097 --> 03:43.932
Be there.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.808
NORMAN: Hey, hey, hey.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.436
Will you read my lips?
I'm on personal time.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.980
Norman, this is exactly
the kind of attitude

03:51.064 --> 03:53.942
why I'm considering taking
my services to Polk Avenue.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.694
Now, I am developing a double-header,

03:56.778 --> 03:58.613
counterfeit money for stolen weapons.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.823
I would like
a little positive reinforcement.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.202
-Give me your wallet.
-Ooh! A stocking stuffer.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.955
Norm, you're taking money out.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.040
Yeah. Here's your inspiration.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.250
Hmm?

04:10.333 --> 04:12.210
Now, come back to me
when you got something.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.378
I'm late.

04:15.338 --> 04:19.092
The man is a motivational genius.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.594
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:21.678 --> 04:23.763
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:23.846 --> 04:27.767
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:27.850 --> 04:29.352
(theme music playing)

05:36.085 --> 05:38.212
(action music playing)

06:10.953 --> 06:14.499
Yeah, it's your lucky day,
slick, so I'm not popping you. So...

06:14.582 --> 06:15.750
Say what?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.418
I'm saying, uh, no arrest.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.212
Take off, you're out of here.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.214
Wait a minute.
Are you forgetting something?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.257
And when I see you downtown,

06:23.341 --> 06:25.593
you can believe me
there's gonna be more to talk about.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.304
So, out of here.
Get out of here. Get lost.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.723
Jeez.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.434
He's a real deep thinker, you know?

06:33.518 --> 06:36.562
You give him a break, and the moron
just stands there. Doesn't know...

06:36.646 --> 06:37.814
Luce--

06:37.897 --> 06:38.898
Excuse me, Joe.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.901
-Lucy, here's that $40 you asked me for.
-Thanks.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.861
You sure you can let me
have it back by Monday?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.446
I got a car payment coming due.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.616
No problem. I really
appreciate the transfusance.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.453
(telephone ringing)

06:54.205 --> 06:57.875
Uh, uh, Mick. Uh, Mick. Detective Belker's
the one that you want to talk to, ma'am.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.837
-Oh. Actually--
-My name is Elizabeth Mies.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.133
I live at 1110 Carol Gardens
in the back apartment.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.469
Three weeks and four days ago,
I was broken into,

07:08.553 --> 07:11.764
and lost my toaster
and some other household items.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.226
-Actually, I'm not sure--
-The stuff is in a pawn shop window

07:15.309 --> 07:17.937
on Utica and 121st Street.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.981
I wrote the name down. Here, it's--

07:20.064 --> 07:22.483
-Nicholson's Loan Mart.
-Nicholson's Loan Mar--

07:22.567 --> 07:25.361
-Well, how did you know that?
-Well, we know that pawn shop

07:25.445 --> 07:26.904
receives stolen merchandise,

07:26.988 --> 07:29.657
so I'm going over there
right now to work there

07:29.740 --> 07:31.409
to catch the people who are doing it.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.786
And what you have to do is make a list.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.205
-Everything you lost--
-They got my electric knife,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.040
which I really don't use.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.293
I don't cook so much now,
now that I'm alone,

07:40.376 --> 07:43.838
and when I do, you know,
my regular knife is just as nice.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.424
-You want to give the list to Sergeant--
-They got a radio,

07:46.507 --> 07:48.050
which doesn't have any batteries,

07:48.134 --> 07:49.510
and some other stuff.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.680
But it's the toaster oven I miss the most.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.681
I know.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.641
In the morning, I come into the kitchen,

07:55.725 --> 07:59.812
I like to have my rye toast
with melted cheese--

07:59.896 --> 08:03.441
Excuse me, Mrs. Mies.
I have to go to Nicholson's now.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.736
Do you know how I know that the toaster
oven they got there is mine?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.488
No, I don't. How?

08:08.571 --> 08:09.947
I asked him to show it to me.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.366
Here. You give me your hand.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.708
Caraway seeds from my toast.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.251
Bingo.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.836
Plus, I recognized it anyway.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.797
You're gonna let me know
when you make the arrest?

08:26.881 --> 08:28.424
Oh, I'm gonna be in touch.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.092
I'm gonna wait to hear from you.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.136
Okay.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.521
Shut up, Joe.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.776
What's the matter?

08:46.859 --> 08:49.612
That $50 you borrowed from me
for Fabian's shoes and sneaks?

08:49.695 --> 08:51.989
-Yeah, what?
-Well, I didn't see him wearing them yet.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.617
It was raining on Saturday.
We couldn't go shopping.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.537
Did my money go
where Jablonski's money's going?

08:58.329 --> 09:01.207
I don't know what you're saying now.
You're making me crazy.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.972
Hey, my man.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.848
-What's going on, huh?
-Hey!

09:18.474 --> 09:20.059
-Joe!
-We got the money you came by for

09:20.142 --> 09:22.436
-this morning, huh?
-You don't have to shout it, baby.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.647
Yeah. He knows
what I'm talking about, Luce.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.399
Where is she? Where's the kid's mother?

09:26.482 --> 09:28.568
Joe, let's go back
to the unit, please, right now.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.696
You're a pimp. What, are you and her
shaking Lucy down now, or what?

09:31.779 --> 09:35.032
You ain't gonna find Tracy
smashing my face into this wall.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.953
-What do you mean "Tracy"? Who's Tracy?
-Tracy, that's what he calls her.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.372
Now, let him go right now, Joe.
Let him go!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.002
You wanna find the lady?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.798
I'll take you to the lady.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.050
Come on. Just come on.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.348
Seem like Tracy and me
in the middle of something.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.018
Whatever it is, we're gonna
straighten it out right now, pal.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.436
Joe, you know you don't have to.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.521
You don't know everything
that's going on here.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.731
-PIMP: Tracy.
-Hey.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.112
What do you want?

10:13.821 --> 10:16.198
-What happened to you?
-They cut her with a razor.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.742
And show him your side, too.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.369
Cut her there, too.
That's why she can't work.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.539
All right, just listen to me.
Lucy's not gonna pay you any more money.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.167
-The two of you made an agreement.
-How's she supposed

10:26.250 --> 10:28.085
-to take care of herself?
-Shut up.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.713
Now, you can get an honest job, or not,

10:30.796 --> 10:33.090
you can clean up, or not,
but she's not paying you

10:33.174 --> 10:35.968
any more shakedown money
so she can take care of your kid!

10:36.802 --> 10:39.555
It seems to me
that we ought to hear from your friend.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.600
-Hey! You're gonna hear it from me, okay?
-Joe!

10:42.683 --> 10:45.478
-Take it easy!
-You're hearing it from both of us.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.480
It's over.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.358
Then what you standing around here for?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.611
Let's get out of here.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.281
Tell me the truth, Renko.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.533
You think I look any younger
without my mustache?

10:59.617 --> 11:01.994
I cannot think about that right now.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.081
-(tires squeal)
-Whoa. Sure seems top-heavy.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.124
Yeah, well, I'm feeling
kind of bottom-heavy.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.335
Do you think
you could pull this unit over, please?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.170
-What?
-Pull it over, Robert.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.881
-Wait a minute. What's the matter?
-I'm telling you, brother,

11:13.964 --> 11:16.717
Mother Nature is calling me,
and she's calling me with a bullhorn.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.428
-Now pull it over!
-(laughs) See, I warned you

11:19.512 --> 11:22.014
about bran muffins in the morning.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.975
RENKO: Daryl Ann,
how can you do this to the man you love?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.894
HILL: Happens every time.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.823
Oh.
Sir, I don't know how to say this to you,

11:38.906 --> 11:42.201
but if you're here on an optional visit,
I am here on a command performance.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.331
(knocking) Sir, uh, if you're having
a problem getting started,

11:47.415 --> 11:49.834
maybe, um, I'll give you $2 here.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.711
I just need a second, but I need it now.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.421
I need it now.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
Sir, I am a police officer,

11:55.840 --> 11:58.008
and you at least owe me
the courtesy of answering me.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.053
Alright, I have no choice
but to bust in there.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.937
Oh, Lord. This man has expired.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.491
Sir...

12:23.117 --> 12:25.911
I hate to treat your moment
of demise like this...

12:27.913 --> 12:29.039
I really do.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.585
But I have to do my duty as I see fit.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.211
(panting)

12:39.592 --> 12:41.844
(clears throat)
Now, anything iffy, remember,

12:41.927 --> 12:44.638
you say, "To the best
of my knowledge and recollection."

12:44.722 --> 12:47.099
That way, they don't nail you for perjury.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.561
90 seconds to air. Scherholtz vs. Schipp.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.645
Yo.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.814
Okay, now,
wait until your case is introduced,

12:53.898 --> 12:56.400
then move as quickly as you can
to your position on the set.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.902
Don't look at the camera.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.528
-Johnny-One-Note.
-Excuse me.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.197
Do we have to sit next to this man?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.990
He has threatened my dog's life.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.326
Well, as soon as the people
move onto the set,

13:05.409 --> 13:06.702
there will be plenty of room.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.871
I was wondering,
since my witness couldn't come,

13:08.954 --> 13:10.456
is it fair for him to have his?

13:10.539 --> 13:13.667
-Please, Miss Schipp.
-That ain't how it works, Miss Schipp.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.338
Sir, here. Could you please put this on?

13:18.589 --> 13:19.507
What's that for?

13:19.590 --> 13:22.218
That's so your tie
doesn't blind 50,000 people.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.220
Blue? (scoffs)

13:24.303 --> 13:25.971
You got no shot, pal.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.681
All right, let it go.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.725
45 seconds.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.354
-Hey, don't I know you?
-No.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.523
Ah, Jerry Weatherspoon, right?

13:35.606 --> 13:38.651
You used to work over at appellate with,
uh, Judge Greenburg?

13:38.734 --> 13:39.693
I don't think so.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.321
Wait a minute.
Something's all coming back to me now.

13:42.905 --> 13:47.326
I see some kind of show and tell
at the court lavatory?

13:47.409 --> 13:49.870
-That was never proved!
-Excuse me, Jerry.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.165
-Your Honor.
-Does the judge know about this, Jer?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.417
Give me a break, will ya?
I got a nice gig here.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.920
(chuckles) Come on, Les.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.338
(laughing)

13:59.421 --> 14:00.714
Cue the intro.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.050
MAN: For the next hour, your living room

14:03.133 --> 14:05.970
becomes the courtroom of Harold Pyle.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.056
Here, in a forum alternative
to the legal system,

14:09.139 --> 14:11.559
but obeying its rules and procedures,

14:11.642 --> 14:15.229
real people come
before a distinguished retired jurist

14:15.312 --> 14:17.982
to seek settlement of real disputes.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.025
Based on Judge Pyle's findings,

14:20.109 --> 14:23.404
successful litigants receive
appropriate cash awards.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.322
For the next 60 minutes,

14:25.406 --> 14:27.783
you are going to see the law in action.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.451
These are not actors.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.870
20% for me.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.705
These mikes are on.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.582
Get ready. Go.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.042
Go. Go!

14:37.126 --> 14:38.586
Hey, get your hands off of me.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.754
Don't look at the camera.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.966
MAN: ...when you've exhausted
your other remedies,

14:44.049 --> 14:47.887
you should demand to
"Tell it to the Judge."

14:48.637 --> 14:50.931
First on Judge Pyle's docket,

14:51.015 --> 14:53.726
the case of a distracted driver.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.605
No wallet, no I.D., no visible marks.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.606
Probably a coronary.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.692
Briefcase hooked to his wrist.
He must be some kind of courier.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.862
If he was a legit courier,
he'd have I.D. This guy's wrong.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.071
We'll write this up, guys.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.699
I'm not real impressed
with that new unit of ours.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.159
Let's go.

15:10.242 --> 15:14.163
J.D., I think maybe one of them
keys might open that briefcase.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.623
That right, Andy? One of these?

15:15.706 --> 15:18.792
Yeah. Little one might open it up.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.169
No kidding?

15:20.794 --> 15:23.464
RENKO: Yeah, and if you open it up,
I think you might find

15:23.547 --> 15:25.674
that it contains a great deal of money.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.427
Whoo! (chuckles)

15:29.637 --> 15:31.639
You, uh, you psychic, Renko,

15:31.722 --> 15:33.474
or did you break into the evidence?

15:33.557 --> 15:36.143
Looks like you were busy
before you came out and got me, Renko.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.646
All right, now, just wait a minute.
Listen to me right now.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.982
Now, every once in a while, a person
has to exercise individual initiative.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.692
If you look at that piece of paper there,
you're gonna find

15:43.776 --> 15:47.196
that it has a phone number that might be
the contact number for this, uh--

15:47.279 --> 15:50.282
Is this a fixed bet, Renko?
You already call this number?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.242
-No, I did not.
-Uh-huh.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.411
Hey, J.D., you know the rules, man.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.123
You know you gotta wait
for the coroner's inventory.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.668
Hey, Renko's got a point.
Okay, this could be big.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.253
What hurt is there in dialing
a random number?

16:06.382 --> 16:07.633
Yeah. Who's this?

16:08.676 --> 16:09.760
Who am I?

16:10.427 --> 16:12.513
I'm sitting here in Topping's diner.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.766
I've been sitting here
half the morning, is who I am.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.687
No, I'm not waiting here. No way.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.940
How about, uh, 1:00 p.m.?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.401
Philly's. Philly's Steak and Hoagie.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.069
You gonna bring the stuff?

16:28.237 --> 16:31.657
Well, obviously,
it's too big to bring inside.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.993
Right. All right.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.744
I'm gonna wait five minutes.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.831
Nobody shows, I'm gone and school's out.

16:40.582 --> 16:43.043
They're on. We're in for the buy.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.378
What are they selling?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.423
I don't know,
it's just too big to bring into Philly's.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.676
Lieutenant Renko. Detective Renko.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.636
Convict Renko.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.055
I can't make it make sense to you, Joe.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.059
I guess I was afraid
that if it went into court,

16:59.143 --> 17:00.644
they'd say I didn't deserve Fabian.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.273
Hey, I told you it didn't make sense.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.650
Now I try and explain it to you,
and you call me crazy.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.820
-I'm not calling you crazy.
-You're sitting there shaking your head.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.156
Yeah, because I think it's really sad

17:12.239 --> 17:14.658
that you don't feel like you
have the right to be happy.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.619
-Where'd you get that?
-And you do deserve it, Luce.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.957
And you don't have to go skunking around,
being afraid that jerks like that

17:22.041 --> 17:24.001
are gonna come along
and take it away from you.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.549
I filled out all the guardian papers,
but I just never--

17:30.632 --> 17:31.967
Let's go file them.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.556
-They're at home, at the apartment.
-Yeah, we'll go get them.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.899
2203 on personal time.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.902
WOMAN (on radio): <i>2203, copy.</i>

17:52.404 --> 17:53.614
Come here.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.950
Thanks, Joe.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.619
It's no problem.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.749
(engine turns over)

18:04.249 --> 18:06.043
See, how about something like this?

18:06.126 --> 18:08.921
This is nice. 12 carats, nickel backing.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.590
It says "Carla." Her name's Fenise.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.717
Any engraver can change that.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.220
Where's Gupta at?

18:16.303 --> 18:18.055
-Can she try it on?
-Sure.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.934
GUPTA: I told you--
no deliveries after 3:00.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.854
Well, the security guard says he wants
$500 to open the door for us, Mr. Gupta.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.855
No way.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.108
Then forget it.
You ain't getting no delivery, man.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.985
Mike? Ring up $250 for my friend.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.947
-No, the guard says $500.
-He'll take $250.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.741
-(buzzer sounds)
-Ring it up under "sale"?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.827
Do I tell you "ring it up under sale"?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.495
Do what I tell you, Mike.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.085
MICK: $250.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.841
$250.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.928
I ain't guaranteeing
he's gonna take this, man.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.930
Then you ain't gonna get
your taste, either.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.349
So, sell him on a 2 1/2.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.896
-How's it coming here?
-It's coming very good, Mr. Gupta.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.774
-(buzzer)
-She's gonna need one more looser.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.485
Mike is gonna find
the right bracelet for you.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.280
-I'll be in the back.
-Okay.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.283
Can I help you?

19:21.201 --> 19:22.744
Excuse me a minute.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.170
What are you doing here, Mrs. Mies?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.005
(whispering) You never called me.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.591
Come here a minute.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.886
Arrest that man right now.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.512
He stole my items.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.972
I'll testify to it in court.

19:42.639 --> 19:46.810
I know you will. But see, we gotta get him
on few other things, too.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.895
Will you trust me?

19:49.396 --> 19:50.814
Will you go home?

19:50.898 --> 19:53.192
Beca-- It's very dangerous in here.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.818
That's why I'm whispering.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.613
I'm gonna call you
as soon as we get anything.

19:59.156 --> 20:03.118
-When?
-Very soon, dear, okay?

20:04.161 --> 20:06.288
Now I gotta go back
and sell some bracelets.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.165
-Good-bye.
-Okay.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.084
-(buzzer sounds)
-Bye.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.463
Hmm.

20:14.546 --> 20:18.050
A: you shouldn't have opened
the briefcase prior to the M.E.'s arrival.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.760
B: you're asking me

20:19.843 --> 20:21.929
to authorize the use
of evidence as buy money.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.555
That okay is supposed
to come from Division.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.266
The window on this stays open
another 45 minutes, Lieutenant.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.518
I don't meet those guys
at that hoagie place by then,

20:28.602 --> 20:29.978
it's sayonara to the whole deal.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.065
When's the last time Division's
planned anything in 45 minutes?

20:33.148 --> 20:36.610
If I okay, I'm complicit in the violation.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.528
Hell of a get-well card for the captain.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.406
40 grand in contraband,
wrong guys on both ends of the deal.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.040
Do it.
Inventory and requisition the contents.

20:50.123 --> 20:51.041
Right.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.378
Promotions all around.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.213
-Bobby, you and Andy on backup.
-Got it.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.256
-Plainclothes?
-Yes.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.257
Good.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.971
Lieutenant, Sal Binachi, line two.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.097
Thanks.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.849
-Sarge.
-What?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.851
Luce and I are gonna take
a couple extra hours.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.562
What's going on today? You two eloping?

21:12.646 --> 21:15.107
How'd you know?
We're gonna go buy some rings.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.735
So, "I left the applications
at home, Joe."

21:18.819 --> 21:21.822
I knew they were at home
or in my locker, one or the other.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.449
And, Your Honor,
I just wanna say one thing.

21:25.158 --> 21:29.079
Ever since the accident,
I keep having nightmares.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.832
JUDGE: I have now heard
from the plaintiff in this case.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.501
Mr. Scherholtz, I understand
you brought a witness?

21:34.584 --> 21:37.546
-My uncle was with me.
-Can we have the witness, please?

21:39.715 --> 21:42.884
Now comes Lieutenant
Norman Buntz of metro police.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.679
Lieutenant Buntz
is the uncle of the plaintiff.

21:45.762 --> 21:49.141
The judge has ruled on the admissibility
of the following evidence.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.310
Lieutenant,
would you tell us what happened

21:51.393 --> 21:52.602
on the night in question?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.229
Oh, sure thing. Uh?

21:55.063 --> 21:56.315
Where? Here?

21:56.398 --> 21:58.442
Over here? Yeah.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.653
Lester and I were returning
from the Haufbrau House,

22:01.737 --> 22:04.239
on account of they do
a nice thing there for pre-Lent.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.408
I had one beer, maybe, total.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.994
That's right. That's correct. One beer.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.039
So, we were proceeding
northbound up Portland.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.167
And then, well, basically,
Les couldn't see it, of course,

22:15.250 --> 22:17.336
because he was paying attention
to his driving.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.630
The defendant, Miss Schipp
over there, comes flying at us,

22:20.714 --> 22:23.258
no horns, no brakes. Boom!

22:23.342 --> 22:26.178
A rear-ender, and we go dribbling out
into the intersection.

22:26.261 --> 22:29.848
In other words, Miss Schipp seemed
to be failing to pay attention.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.225
-Oh, yeah.
-I was paying attention!

22:32.309 --> 22:33.894
His taillights weren't working.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.562
My taillights were working fine,
Your Honor.

22:35.645 --> 22:38.231
-The police said they weren't.
-Sure, after the accident,

22:38.315 --> 22:39.399
after she smashed them.

22:40.108 --> 22:43.070
My fiancé, Roger, saw it.
It's in his statement.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.405
Your fiancé saw what, Miss Schipp?

22:45.489 --> 22:48.575
Judge, that statement
from the fiancé's a crock.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.827
-JUDGE: All right, Lieutenant.
-(bangs gavel)

22:50.911 --> 22:54.664
Lieutenant, on what basis
are you impeaching

22:54.748 --> 22:58.085
the supporting affidavit
of Miss Schipp's fiancé?

22:58.168 --> 23:00.629
On the basis, at the time of the accident,

23:00.712 --> 23:04.674
the defendant's fiancé's head
was not visible in the other vehicle.

23:04.758 --> 23:07.636
And in my opinion, at said time,

23:07.719 --> 23:11.431
he probably was engaged
in some unnatural sex act.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.016
-(bangs gavel)
-Cut. Cut!

23:13.100 --> 23:14.518
-Unnatural sex act?
-Yeah.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.520
That's why his statement's a pile of bull.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.313
He couldn't see nothing from his angle.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.107
MAN: "Unnatural sex act"? Are you crazy?

23:20.190 --> 23:21.441
This is an afternoon show.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.027
Well, great. That don't make
what he was doing natural.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.779
My mother is going to hear this?

23:25.862 --> 23:28.031
My mom is gonna hear what he just said?

23:28.115 --> 23:29.866
-Five minutes, Your Honor.
-JUDGE: Five.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.535
-Lieutenant.
-Yeah?

23:32.327 --> 23:33.829
(chuckles)

23:35.914 --> 23:37.124
(clears throat)

23:37.207 --> 23:38.542
So, how's the patient?

23:39.126 --> 23:42.754
Well, I was thinking of going in
for a half day this afternoon.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.549
Thank God I'm not talking
from experience, Frank.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.926
-That sounds like pushing it.
-I'll take it easy.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.179
Hell of a streaky thing, isn't it, Frank?

23:51.972 --> 23:53.014
-What?
-Life.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.976
I mean, now that you've survived,
it's pretty obvious

23:56.059 --> 23:59.104
this whole shooting business
has only strengthened your hand

23:59.187 --> 24:00.689
in terms of career choices.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.442
I guess I'm on a roll.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.570
Whereas my own options keep narrowing.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.035
-Whoo.
-Oh, coffee a little too strong?

24:14.119 --> 24:18.748
No, no. It's good. It's fine.
Actually, I think I'll try a little milk.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.750
Here, I'll get it.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.255
The Crime Institute...

24:27.257 --> 24:29.301
Their search committee
has decided to hold off

24:29.384 --> 24:31.636
on recommending me for that consultancy.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.431
They think I still have exposure
on this Keenan mess.

24:35.015 --> 24:38.435
That could throw quite a monkey wrench
into a lot of people's future plans...

24:39.186 --> 24:40.187
not least your own.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.688
What's on your mind, Chief?

24:42.939 --> 24:44.900
You were the chief inquisitor on Keenan.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.986
Those are the findings
the search committee's uneasy about.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.529
I'm not gonna recant.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.240
There's no one ringing a bell,
Frank, I understand that.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.660
But a letter of explanation,
for their eyes only.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.830
Frank, I'm looking for a place to fall.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.625
I'll detail the panel's findings,
and I'll give you the letter.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.959
You decide whether to send it.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.505
I hope you remember there are ways
and ways of saying the same thing.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.673
No preconditions, Chief.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.260
No preconditions. Agreed.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.389
So, you're thinking
about going in later on?

25:16.890 --> 25:18.141
If I feel up to it.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.311
Well, uh, don't push it, Frank.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.067
-Easy does it.
-I'll take it easy.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.996
How you doing? I'm De Petrus.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.374
I'm bored. How about we just do it?

25:42.457 --> 25:44.668
All right, we can walk. It's not far.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.129
Hey.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.131
He comes or I go home.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.259
So you like company. No problem.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.803
You know, if this goes good,
maybe we get regular.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.888
So far, I got nothing, huh?

26:04.271 --> 26:07.274
What happened this morning,
I'm not at fault, you're not at fault--

26:07.357 --> 26:09.109
Yeah, yeah, it's a no-fault state.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.194
Neal, make sure that door don't close.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.613
Yeah, sure. Man the doors, Neal.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.324
Even got you a truck,
and the rental's on me.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.536
Yeah, right.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.372
Here's the menu.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.335
There is the main course.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.878
Ooh, uh...

26:29.504 --> 26:33.758
You, uh, set a nice table, Mr. De Petrus.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.844
Freeze-- Federal Bureau of Investigation!

26:35.927 --> 26:37.012
You're under arrest!

26:37.095 --> 26:38.597
Hold it right there!

26:39.431 --> 26:40.765
Hey, come on. Just be cool.

26:42.058 --> 26:42.892
Okay, out.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.979
Please, uh, don't shoot.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.988
-You guys are Feds?
-You're making a mistake here.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.449
-Shut up! We'll do the talking.
-Who are you?

26:57.532 --> 27:00.076
-These guys are city cops, sir.
-We all are.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.163
-I don't believe this.
-All right, men, back off.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.749
You have destroyed
a carefully orchestrated

27:05.832 --> 27:07.917
and costly federal investigation.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.753
Hey, you just did the same thing to us.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.046
-Hey, J.D.
-The hell with it.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.756
He wants to get into name-calling.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.924
Now, we got months involved with this.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.635
-Hey, come on.
-Look, it seems obvious

27:16.718 --> 27:19.512
that you must've taken that briefcase
from Muammar's courier.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.306
-Could be.
-Just please tell me

27:21.389 --> 27:23.933
that the man is still in your custody.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.894
-We don't work like that.
-You released him?

27:25.977 --> 27:28.688
I don't need him. I know where he is,
I know what he's doing.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.024
He picks his nose,
I'm the first to hear about it.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.276
-I want Muammar.
-So do I.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.236
Only I'm close, you're not.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.281
Now, uh, I could be open to something.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.701
The man is an arms supplier
for international terrorists.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.954
What conceivable reasons
could you have for investigating him?

27:45.038 --> 27:49.000
Sure. You Feds, you got
the corner on major crime, huh?

27:49.084 --> 27:52.170
Well, the hell with this.
You're so sharp, you find him.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.798
Look, if Muammar
could be remanded to my custody

27:54.881 --> 27:57.759
within, say, eight hours,
I'd be impressed.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.469
Impressed.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.388
I don't know what that means.

28:01.471 --> 28:03.598
Well, for one thing,
you wouldn't have to consider

28:03.682 --> 28:05.141
a midlife career change.

28:05.850 --> 28:06.810
He's yours.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.605
Look, you're not going to say
"unnatural sex", period!

28:10.689 --> 28:12.732
Come on, I thought you people
wanted the truth.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.651
Lieutenant, isn't it correct

28:14.734 --> 28:18.863
you couldn't actually see in
Ms. Schipp's car below window level?

28:18.947 --> 28:21.241
I mean, her fiancé could just as easily

28:21.324 --> 28:24.452
have been fixing the Velcro
on the vehicle's floor mats.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.830
-Are you kidding me?
-No, I'm not kidding you.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.749
Your prior speculation
is inadmissible. Strike it.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.793
That's right.
Strike it. Strike it and edit it.

28:31.876 --> 28:35.714
Your intent is to impeach
Ms. Schipp's passenger as a witness.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.299
Now, why don't you just simply say
that you didn't see him,

28:38.383 --> 28:40.093
and therefore he couldn't have seen you,

28:40.176 --> 28:43.012
-and get on with the testimony?
-All right.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.932
All right. We're rolling, everybody.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.058
Action.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.020
You say Ms. Schipp's passenger
is an unreliable witness

28:51.104 --> 28:53.898
to the accident's circumstances,
Lieutenant, how so?

28:53.982 --> 28:55.191
How so?

28:56.109 --> 28:58.570
He was bent over in the front seat.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.574
Heaven only knows
what he was doing down there.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.578
Right, Captain, I wouldn't push it.

29:06.661 --> 29:09.038
No, sure, I'll have that
on your desk by 3:00.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.708
Okay, then,
we might see you later then, huh?

29:13.168 --> 29:15.837
-Here's your keys, Lieutenant.
-It's fine.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.131
So, I'll give you my guesstimate.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.883
That's a two, three-day job, easy.

29:19.966 --> 29:23.595
-How much?
-2,200, 2,500, something like that.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.554
Don't hold me to it.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.765
Don't hold you to it?
Is that your estimate or what?

29:26.848 --> 29:29.184
Once I start rooting around,
who knows where that goes?

29:29.267 --> 29:31.227
-Great.
-I don't know who you had up there

29:31.311 --> 29:33.688
fooling around, Lieutenant,
but if you want my opinion,

29:33.772 --> 29:36.441
someone tried to move
that fixture with a crowbar.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.610
Previous tenant.

29:38.693 --> 29:41.237
Whoever, they screwed it up real good.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.742
I do not know why in the world

29:45.825 --> 29:48.578
you had to come on so strong
to that FBI guy, J.D.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.580
How about I was trying
to save our jobs, Renko,

29:50.663 --> 29:52.081
buy us a little time?

29:52.165 --> 29:53.458
How are we gonna find

29:53.541 --> 29:55.168
-what's his name?
-Muammar.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.712
What do you expect me to do,
Andy, huh, roll over and die?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.923
-Uh-oh. Bad news.
-What?

30:00.006 --> 30:03.426
Leave the force now, you kiss
your pension contributions adios.

30:03.510 --> 30:04.385
No vesting.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.972
I am telling you right now.
We cannot and will not be fired.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.559
As your PBA rep,
I say suspension's possible,

30:11.643 --> 30:15.063
demotion's probable,
but being fired is highly unlikely.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.940
-Gentlemen.
-Hey, Sidney.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.984
Sid. Sid! Sid!

30:22.904 --> 30:26.282
Do you, uh, know any Arab gun dealers?

30:26.783 --> 30:29.619
No, but I do know a tube steak

30:30.370 --> 30:33.122
who's trying to pass himself off
as an Arab gun dealer.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.999
-You do?
-Yeah. His name is Larry.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.543
He's a third-rate counterfeiter.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.711
I tried to interest Norman
in him this morning,

30:38.795 --> 30:41.256
but he was too involved
with his television career.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.341
Sid, you are beautiful.

30:43.424 --> 30:46.052
-From certain angles.
-Come here.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.221
Francie.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.641
Hey, take it easy.

30:51.724 --> 30:55.103
Yeah. Okay, that's everything.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.814
-WOMAN: You're missing a blue form.
-The blue?

30:57.897 --> 30:59.274
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm sorry.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.652
-I can't take this without the blue form.
-I'll just bring the blue form in.

31:02.735 --> 31:05.488
-I have everything else.
-No, it has to all be together. I'm sorry.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.032
LUCY: Well, let me just leave
this here now with you and--

31:08.116 --> 31:10.618
I can't take care of this, ma'am.
You'll have to bring it altogether.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.538
-I'll bring it back later.
-Wait, what's wrong? What's the matter?

31:13.621 --> 31:16.583
I don't have the blue forms.
I guess I left them in my locker.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.793
You're such a jerk.

31:19.794 --> 31:22.422
I forgot, okay, Joe? I forgot.

31:22.505 --> 31:23.590
Can she mail them in?

31:23.673 --> 31:27.093
Regulations require
all applications must be presented

31:27.176 --> 31:28.511
in a completed form.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.722
Okay. So I'll come back on Monday--

31:30.805 --> 31:33.683
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
She has everything else, right?

31:33.766 --> 31:35.768
(inhales) How long does it take
for these papers

31:35.852 --> 31:37.854
to get
to Social Services once they leave here?

31:37.937 --> 31:39.063
What do you mean how long?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.649
Well, I mean, it takes time
to process them, right?

31:41.733 --> 31:44.152
I mean, you're not gonna send
them over this afternoon.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.487
On average, ten working days.

31:47.363 --> 31:49.699
Well, couldn't you start
processing the application?

31:49.782 --> 31:51.367
And we'll mail the document in.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.411
I explained to you, I can't do that, sir.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.498
Miss, I wouldn't ask you
to do this if it wasn't really important.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.585
For another thing, mail applications
are received at another office.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.962
No problem. Look,
we'll address the envelope

32:03.046 --> 32:04.881
and make it special attention to you.

32:04.964 --> 32:07.383
I'm a city employee, too,
and I can get mail at the precinct

32:07.467 --> 32:08.885
if I give them my badge number.

32:09.385 --> 32:11.346
She'll have to address it to Mrs. Johnson,

32:11.429 --> 32:14.807
municipal employee number 735.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.559
You are an angel, Mrs. Johnson.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.227
LUCY: Thank you.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.396
And she got to get it here
by no later than Tuesday.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.648
Tuesday.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.232
You are official now.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.234
Oh, wait a minute. Gotta pay the cashier.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.736
Window nine.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.238
Thank you.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.408
(indistinct conversations)

32:34.494 --> 32:37.664
WOMAN: I've been waiting
in this line for almost an hour.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.837
Fellas, you're gonna make me nauseous.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.215
-Are you sure about this guy?
-Detective,

32:47.298 --> 32:49.717
Muammar is Larry Buckhalter.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.803
No way his pitch
to those FBI guys was real?

32:51.886 --> 32:54.555
-No!
-He has no Middle East arms contact?

32:54.639 --> 32:57.016
Larry ran scam junkets to the Holy Land.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.726
He probably picked up a little Arabic.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.480
Fellas, he was showing these
guys counterfeit paper.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.274
He was gonna sell any pieces
he bought on the street.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.236
Listen to me, haircut, our entire careers
are riding on this,

33:08.319 --> 33:11.322
-so you'd better be right.
-Oh, yeah. Like we got a choice.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.491
Let's go talk to Muammar.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.996
-The guy's living here?
-Yeah.

33:18.079 --> 33:21.040
I guess he moved out of his car
when he struck it rich.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.251
-You want us to go with you?
-No, we can handle it.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.378
Listen, don't underestimate this guy.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.005
We should be so lucky.

33:31.843 --> 33:32.760
(knocking)

33:32.844 --> 33:36.055
Yo! Larry, baby! Are you in there, man?

33:37.306 --> 33:39.517
-Police!
-Hey, there he goes!

33:39.600 --> 33:41.477
-Where?
-Behind the boxes!

33:44.480 --> 33:47.608
-Come here!
-Hey, man, what is this?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.986
-Hey.
-You tell us, Muammar.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.113
Muammar? Come on!

33:52.196 --> 33:53.531
Hey, see that?

33:53.614 --> 33:55.533
That's what we said, Muammar.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.660
Kind of weird
for a street punk named Larry.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.246
But, see, De Petrus keeps saying
he's buying guns from you--

34:00.329 --> 34:02.665
whole shipments
of illegal arms from Muammar,

34:02.749 --> 34:05.793
A.K.A. pack rat,
counterfeiter, scam artist--

34:05.877 --> 34:08.087
-What scam? Name it.
-Look, my man.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.048
You have heaved enough crap
our way already.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.549
You referring to my merchandise?

34:11.632 --> 34:13.634
-What'd you do, steal it?
-I bought it, man.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.553
With that funny money
you've been running off?

34:15.636 --> 34:17.513
-That the deal, Larry?
-Deal? Deal? Deal?

34:17.597 --> 34:19.891
You want to know all about the deal.
I'll tell you all about the deal.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.726
Only it ain't my deal.
I didn't have nothing to do--

34:21.809 --> 34:24.228
-Hey, calm down, man.
-Jimmy G.'s the one who had the deal.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.482
He was the one who had the place. It was
his place. That's whose deal it was.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.525
Only Jimmy G. is gone, man.
He's gone upstate--

34:29.609 --> 34:32.028
-Slow. You slow down.
-Ben, hundreds

34:32.111 --> 34:33.780
and I used to help him
run them off every now and then.

34:33.863 --> 34:35.531
And that's all I did! Honest to God.

34:35.615 --> 34:38.910
Only when he went upstate, man,
I run off a couple loads.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.913
-That was my mistake.
-That was one of them.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.082
Come on.

34:46.167 --> 34:50.046
(speaking Arabic)

34:50.129 --> 34:51.380
That's Arabic.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.883
Yeah, I picked it up from this Muslim dude

34:53.966 --> 34:55.593
that I was celled with
over on Michigan Avenue.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.762
Some you can't get talking.
This one you can't shut up.

34:57.845 --> 35:01.099
(shouting in Arabic)

35:01.182 --> 35:03.976
And that means that I am of royal blood

35:04.060 --> 35:07.605
-and I have made my pilgrimage to Mecca.
-Can you believe they went for this guy?

35:07.688 --> 35:10.149
Yeah, one thing I've got to say,
when I'm out here hustlin',

35:10.233 --> 35:11.526
I am believable.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.694
-You guys see the problem, don't you?
-Yeah, he's crazy.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.072
-Let the feds worry about it.
-Feds? What Feds?

35:16.155 --> 35:17.740
-They bought him before?
-God knows how.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.200
What are you guys talking about?

35:19.283 --> 35:21.494
Trouble is, if they realize
we slipped them a hummer,

35:21.577 --> 35:24.288
they're gonna hold us responsible.
That's how the Feds operate.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.083
If they take a fall, they're not taking it
alone, they'll drag us down with them.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.127
Hey, what are you guys,
the Feds set me up, man?

35:29.210 --> 35:30.837
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know. We're in the soup.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.380
You? What about me?

35:34.465 --> 35:36.843
Rolling. Homestretch, folks.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.557
-Judge Pyle's returned with his verdict.
-BAILIFF: All rise.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.018
-What do you think?
-Spend the money.

35:48.229 --> 35:53.109
A finding in this case
depends on assessing the likely veracity

35:53.192 --> 35:55.528
of the competing versions
of the incidents.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.740
We have heard allegations
that the defendant, Miss Schipp,

35:59.824 --> 36:00.867
was inattentive.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.870
We've also heard
that Mr. Scherholtz had been drinking

36:03.953 --> 36:06.247
and that his taillights
were not functioning.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.291
While this is a close call,

36:08.374 --> 36:11.085
the court finds
a likely preponderance of merit

36:11.169 --> 36:14.463
in the contentions
of the defendant, Naomi Schipp.

36:14.547 --> 36:17.216
Are you freaking kidding?
This is a joke here.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.634
This is ridiculous.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.804
No, first of all, you don't let
the people say what really happened,

36:21.888 --> 36:23.723
and then you kangaroo through the verdict.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.683
Why don't you subpoena the carpet muncher?

36:25.766 --> 36:29.103
Could you keep your mouth shut
long enough for him to say "next case"?

36:29.187 --> 36:30.438
JUDGE: Next case--
-MAN: Cut!

36:30.521 --> 36:33.024
Did she promise you some turn
on the floor mats with her, huh?

36:33.107 --> 36:34.901
You're about to blow
your appearance fee, my friend.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.861
Which one of these creeps
are you related to?

36:36.944 --> 36:39.322
We have a finish, folks.
We have corridor follow-up.

36:39.405 --> 36:40.781
Oh, jeez, I can't wait.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.075
Not you. You are finished.

36:44.076 --> 36:45.494
Great job, Lieutenant.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.830
Oh, yeah, please,
crack wise with me, Jerry,

36:47.914 --> 36:51.709
huh, because it's gonna take a whole lot
for me to clean your clock, right?

36:56.088 --> 36:58.466
-(rattling)
-I don't know what that is.

36:58.549 --> 37:02.595
Now, maybe that's those 17 jewels
rattling around in there.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.347
Jump to it with the piece, man.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.307
A Rolex ain't indestructible.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.060
Junk, six bucks.

37:09.143 --> 37:12.688
This is a $1,200 watch
in a fine jewelry store.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.149
Gupta in the back?
Tell him I got the rest of his parcels

37:15.233 --> 37:16.859
on the truck and I'm bringing them in.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.778
-(siren wailing)
-Give me the $6, man.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.782
-(buzzer sounds)
-$6.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.618
-You skip the receipt.
-(buzzer sounds)

37:33.793 --> 37:36.337
Do I pay you to mind
other people's business, Mike?

37:36.420 --> 37:39.507
No, I was just seeing
where you wanted the popcorn makers.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.051
-We're closed!
-Put your hands up.

37:42.593 --> 37:43.511
What are you doing?

37:43.594 --> 37:45.846
Don't argue with the old broad.
Just do like she says.

37:45.930 --> 37:50.184
You, I want that toaster oven.
The one on the second shelf.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.186
-Put the gun down, lady.
-The hell I will.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.562
MICK: Put the gun down!

37:53.646 --> 37:54.981
Are you trying to get us killed?

37:55.064 --> 37:56.732
(buzzer sounds)

37:57.400 --> 37:58.401
(shot)

38:00.569 --> 38:03.239
I'm a police officer! You're under arrest!

38:03.322 --> 38:05.825
Get down on the floor. Move!

38:06.325 --> 38:07.660
Hands behind your head!

38:13.374 --> 38:14.792
We captured him.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.426
Here's the unsuccessful plaintiff.

38:23.509 --> 38:26.887
Excuse me, sir, could we have
your reaction to Judge Pyle's verdict?

38:26.971 --> 38:30.141
(scoffs) Naturally, I thought
it should have gone the other way.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.811
Guess I have to admit
the defendant's prettier than I am.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.398
Possibly we haven't seen
our last motion for the case yet.

38:37.481 --> 38:40.526
Oh, you know, you're a real moron.
You get just what you deserve.

38:40.609 --> 38:41.861
Cut!

38:41.944 --> 38:44.697
-Will you shut your damn mouth?
-How about I shut your eyes?

38:44.780 --> 38:45.990
Get security, please!

38:46.073 --> 38:47.908
Hey, forget it, pal. Don't worry.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.285
We're out of here. Come on.

38:49.368 --> 38:52.204
-Where do we go to pick up your dough?
-They said they'd mail it to me.

38:52.288 --> 38:56.334
Yeah. Hey, I, uh,
I don't know if I helped you, kid.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.753
MAN: How do you explain

38:58.836 --> 39:02.423
that nothing in Division files
even remotely suggests

39:02.506 --> 39:05.384
that your people are involved
in investigation of this arms dealer?

39:05.468 --> 39:07.845
Not everything goes through
Division, Mr. Saunders.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.391
Are you telling me the investigation
is being carried out under your direction?

39:12.892 --> 39:15.686
For the man responsible,
you seem totally uninformed.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.439
I won't comment
on the actions of my officers

39:18.522 --> 39:21.233
-until I've heard their explanation.
-And when is that gonna be?

39:21.317 --> 39:22.234
Soon.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.658
Hey. Where you been?

39:29.742 --> 39:32.370
Mailed the form.
Mailbox out front has an early pickup.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.163
-All right.
-Want me to bring anything by

39:34.246 --> 39:37.041
-for the game tonight?
-Money, just money, pal.

39:37.124 --> 39:39.126
I gotta go get some beer.
You want to come with me?

39:39.210 --> 39:40.127
Yeah.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.255
Hey, Joe...

39:44.048 --> 39:45.257
thanks for everything.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.597
How's that new unit been treating you?

39:51.680 --> 39:55.142
Uh, got kind of detoured today, Sarge.
Couldn't make a real good impression.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.978
It's gotta be better than those rattle
traps we got on the road now.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.563
It did seem to be a little top-heavy.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.440
We gotta have the report in by tomorrow.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.150
Okay. We'll turn it in tomorrow.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.902
If we still have a job by tomorrow.

40:06.779 --> 40:09.532
-Lieutenant, Agent Saunders.
-Where is he?

40:09.615 --> 40:11.283
You mean, uh, Muammar?

40:11.367 --> 40:13.285
That's who he means, Detective.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.622
You want Muammar, we could probably get
him for you sometime tonight.

40:16.705 --> 40:19.250
You know, he usually sleeps
in his car around Dekker and 138.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.919
Of course, with all our heat coming down
after the guy he hired

40:22.002 --> 40:24.630
to make the pass at you croaked,
he's gonna lay low for a while.

40:24.713 --> 40:27.967
But if you really, really want,
we could probably drum him up for you.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.344
What do you mean he sleeps in his car?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.805
Muammar is a low-rent scam artist,
Agent Saunders.

40:32.888 --> 40:35.433
-Folks call him Larry.
-Check his sheet.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.893
J.D.: Neal,
what's low-rent about a loitering beef?

40:37.977 --> 40:40.646
How about "failure
to produce satisfactory I.D."?

40:40.729 --> 40:42.898
I guess he produced
enough satisfactory I.D.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.692
for Agent Saunders here to believe

40:44.775 --> 40:46.527
he was gonna buy a bunch of weapons.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.655
If I was you, Agent Saunders,
I could see a serious argument

40:49.738 --> 40:51.782
for writing this one up "subject escaped,"

40:51.866 --> 40:53.242
but you make the call.

40:54.243 --> 40:55.703
(indistinct chatter)

40:58.539 --> 41:01.000
(telephone rings)

41:03.252 --> 41:04.211
-(whistles)
-Worked.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.672
We don't know that, J.D.
We don't know what he's gonna do.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.467
And do you know what would have happened
if he had written this up?

41:09.550 --> 41:11.969
Well, sir, I don't think
he's gonna do that.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.847
I'd say it's 80% certain he'll do nothing.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.599
80%. 80% is not that good.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.392
I've lived with worse.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.483
-First name?
-Jawarhalal.

41:26.901 --> 41:27.902
Hey.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.404
Mrs. Mies to see you again.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.286
Sit, barf breath!

41:45.294 --> 41:46.128
What?

41:46.670 --> 41:48.547
I would like my items back.

41:49.131 --> 41:51.133
You want your items back?

41:51.800 --> 41:54.178
Lady, you're lucky
I don't arrest you for armed robbery.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.514
I'm sorry, but you were too slow.

41:56.972 --> 41:58.265
I was slow?

42:02.394 --> 42:05.105
You know, it took me four days
to set that bust up,

42:05.189 --> 42:07.441
and I didn't get a seller,
I didn't get a felony.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.693
I didn't even get a TV set.
Know what I got?

42:09.777 --> 42:12.696
I got seven cases of popcorn poppers

42:12.780 --> 42:15.241
and you, a person
who knows nothing about police work!

42:15.324 --> 42:17.159
What do I have to know?

42:17.743 --> 42:20.871
I get robbed, and you cops do nothing!

42:20.955 --> 42:23.040
I may not have that long.

42:23.123 --> 42:25.668
Do you realize that, sonny?
You don't know my condition.

42:26.961 --> 42:31.966
And the one little pleasure I give myself
is toasted cheese in the morning.

42:32.049 --> 42:33.467
You can't use your broiler?

42:33.551 --> 42:36.136
It catches fire under the broiler.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.055
Do you want me to burn up, too?

42:42.059 --> 42:44.937
Take this to the cop
who's doing the inventory.

42:45.020 --> 42:47.064
He will release your toaster oven.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.567
Thank you.

42:49.650 --> 42:50.859
Now, what about my gun?

42:52.653 --> 42:55.030
Bye-bye, Mr. Mies.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.407
(whispers) Thank you.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.501
Spell "Jawarhararrarrrrle."

43:09.044 --> 43:10.504
Make it "Jerry."

43:12.965 --> 43:15.092
-Hey, Sarge.
-What?

43:15.175 --> 43:16.302
Never mind.

43:18.554 --> 43:21.390
Uh, Norm,
now that you've made your network debut,

43:21.473 --> 43:23.475
I figure you're in a magnanimous mood.

43:23.559 --> 43:26.687
I bet you're dying
to give me back my torn currency.

43:26.770 --> 43:30.316
-You figure wrong.
-Hey, wait! Wait!

43:30.399 --> 43:33.068
Norm, while you were out
"Going Hollywood,"

43:33.152 --> 43:35.529
I was providing
Detectives LaRue and Washington

43:35.613 --> 43:37.114
with invaluable information.

43:37.197 --> 43:39.325
Don't tell me,
you solved the Marilyn Monroe case?

43:39.408 --> 43:41.994
It's okay, Norm.
The man's rating's triple-A right now.

43:42.077 --> 43:44.163
-Yeah? Who'd he give you?
-Nobody.

43:44.246 --> 43:45.998
Nobody? (whistles)

43:46.081 --> 43:47.625
I must be going deaf.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.794
I could have sworn
I heard the exotic name Muammar

43:50.878 --> 43:52.463
pass from my lips to your ears.

43:52.546 --> 43:56.425
I also distinctly recall
a happy smile of relief on your face.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.636
Sid, it gives me great pleasure
to award you a check

43:58.719 --> 44:00.846
in the amount of the big triple-zero.
Now get lost.

44:00.929 --> 44:03.891
But Sid's non-information
led to a nonarrest,

44:03.974 --> 44:06.018
which really put us on the map
with the FBI.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.811
Now, Sidney, here's $50.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.855
Keep up the good work,
and keep your mouth shut.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.523
This usually wakes me up.

44:11.607 --> 44:12.858
Am I hearing this right--

44:12.941 --> 44:15.069
we got no bust at all,
and you're paying that off?

44:15.152 --> 44:16.904
What we got here is a potential bust.

44:16.987 --> 44:19.907
We're probably gonna nail Muammar
tomorrow for passing funny money.

44:19.990 --> 44:24.620
(sighs) Look, I'm doing this
as a professional courtesy,

44:24.703 --> 44:28.040
but I think we're establishing
a dangerous precedent there.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.334
Thank you. I'm going home to take a nap.

44:30.417 --> 44:33.003
When I wake up, I bet I'm back in Kansas.

44:33.921 --> 44:37.091
You ain't gonna believe this,
even if you understand it.

44:38.008 --> 44:40.678
When I was single,
I had a scroungy kind of a place.

44:40.761 --> 44:43.681
Ol' Joe Coffey, he's got
like a roach hotel up there.

44:43.764 --> 44:46.183
Plus Mr. Home Beautiful
has only two usable chairs.

44:46.266 --> 44:48.769
Come on, two? I was there
last week, and I'm sure he had three.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.270
Yeah, well, he broke the third one

44:50.354 --> 44:52.439
trying to hit this rat
who ran away with his service revolver.

44:52.523 --> 44:56.068
Hey, don't be so hard on Joe.
He serves a nice stew.

44:56.151 --> 44:59.321
-What do you think happened to the rat?
-You guys are terrible.

44:59.405 --> 45:01.490
Andy, you're gonna bring
the chips and the pretzels?

45:01.573 --> 45:04.785
-Yes, Sarge. See you in a couple hours.
-I'm reimbursing everybody for eats.

45:04.868 --> 45:07.413
You announced that
three or four times back at roll call.

45:08.247 --> 45:10.082
Got another nickel there, ma'am?

45:10.666 --> 45:12.000
How much more?

45:12.584 --> 45:15.504
-Just five cents.
-Look, they don't have any Garcia Vegas.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.798
-I'm gonna try across the street.
-Okay. Yeah, yeah.

45:23.637 --> 45:25.556
MAN: Hey! Wait up!

45:25.639 --> 45:26.932
MAN 2: Get it moving, man!

45:28.183 --> 45:30.686
(traffic noises)

45:34.982 --> 45:36.900
How you doing?

45:36.984 --> 45:38.193
Do you have any Garcia Vegas?

45:38.277 --> 45:39.737
No. Unh-unh.

45:40.612 --> 45:41.947
I think you got some back...

45:44.825 --> 45:46.326
(shot)

45:46.994 --> 45:49.329
(gunshot)

45:49.413 --> 45:53.500
(glass shatters)

45:53.584 --> 45:55.294
(suspenseful music plays)

45:55.377 --> 45:57.880
Joe, where are you?
I think I heard gunshots.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.798
Something happened in the smoke shop.

46:00.632 --> 46:02.760
-This thing?
-Over there, yeah.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.180
Joe, are you in the smoke shop?

46:06.263 --> 46:07.890
Give me your position.

46:07.973 --> 46:09.975
Possible gunfire in the smoke shop.

46:17.232 --> 46:20.652
Officer shot. Officer down.
This is Bates. I can't get a pulse.

46:20.736 --> 46:22.571
WOMAN (on radio): <i>What's your 10-20, 2203?</i>

46:22.654 --> 46:24.907
I'm at a smoke shop.

46:24.990 --> 46:27.409
Al's Smoke Shop, Van Buren.

46:27.493 --> 46:28.744
It's on Van Buren.

46:28.827 --> 46:30.954
(whispering)

46:31.038 --> 46:34.041
(inhales, exhales)

46:34.124 --> 46:35.167
(whispers)

46:35.250 --> 46:37.127
(screams)

46:37.211 --> 46:39.296
(grunts)

46:39.379 --> 46:40.964
(panting)

46:43.675 --> 46:44.843
Jesus.

46:51.517 --> 46:54.520
(melancholic music playing)

47:09.827 --> 47:11.411
How long they gonna let him lie there?

47:11.495 --> 47:13.664
Luce, we gotta get everything we can.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.792
Captain.

47:22.047 --> 47:27.052
(helicopter whirring)

47:36.895 --> 47:40.691
(emotional music playing)

47:40.774 --> 47:43.610
(sirens wailing)

47:43.694 --> 47:46.363
(indistinct conversations)

48:03.171 --> 48:05.173
(theme music playing)
