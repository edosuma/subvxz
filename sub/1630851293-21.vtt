CHRIS CUOMO MIGHT SAY...

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
THE CORONAVIRUS.

01:27.000 --> 01:27.000
BECAUSE SADLY, OUR

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
HOT VAX SUMMER SEEMS TO BE

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
GIVING WAY TO DIPSHIT AUTUMN

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
AS THE DELTA VARIANT IS

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
SPREADING WILDLY AROUND

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
AMONG THE UNVACCINATED,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
WITH THE U.S. AVERAGING AROUND

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
100,000 NEW INFECTIONS A DAY.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
AND ALARMINGLY, ROUGHLY 15% OF

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
NEW CASES OUR CHILDREN, WITH

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
OVER 250 KIDS BEING NEWLY

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
HOSPITALIZED EACH DAY.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
AND ALL OF THIS MEANS THAT MANY

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
HOSPITALS ARE YET AGAIN BEING

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN PARTS OF

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
THE COUNTRY, WITH FLORIDA AND

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
TEXAS ALONE ACCOUNTING FOR

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
40% OF NEW HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
THE RESPONSE OF FLORIDA'S

02:02.000 --> 02:02.000

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
>> TODAY, FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
CONCEDED THINGS MAY LOOK BAD.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I THINK MOST PEOPLE

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
AND SO WE JUST HAVE TO

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THAT'S

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
HAPPENING, THESE WAVES ARE

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
DEAL WITH.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
A FEW YEARS AGO THAT FLORIDA'S

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WOULD

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
RESPOND TO A DEADLY THREAT WITH

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
"THESE WAVES ARE SOMETHING YOU

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH," I'D

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
HAVE ASSUMED THEY WERE TALKING

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
ABOUT MIAMI SINKING INTO A

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
WARMING OCEAN, NOT A COMPLETELY

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
DIFFERENT, TOTALLY SELF-INDUCED

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
THIS CUT-RATE COACH TAYLOR

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
SAYING, "JUST DEAL WITH IT" WHEN

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
HE SEEMS TO BE VERY MUCH NOT

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
DOING THAT.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, DeSANTIS

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000

MASK MANDATES -- MAKING FLORIDA

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
ONE OF AT LEAST SEVEN STATES

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
NOW PROHIBITING SCHOOLS FROM

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
IMPOSING THEM.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
AND SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AROUND

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
THE COUNTRY HAVE SEEN FIERY

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
EXCHANGES ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
IN NORTH CAROLINA,

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
REPRESENTATIVE MADISON CAWTHORN

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
SHOWED UP TO ONE, TO DO WHATEVER

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
THIS IS.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
>> THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR

03:07.000 --> 03:07.000
CHILDREN TODAY DOES NOT COME

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
FROM COVID-19.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
IT COMES FROM WOKE, LIBERAL

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LIKE YOU

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
WHO THINK THEY ARE ALL KNOWING

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
AND ALL WISE.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I'M A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
ABRAHAM KUYKENDALL, ONE OF THE

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
FIRST MEN TO SETTLE THIS COUNTY.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
HE KNEW HARDSHIP FIRSTHAND.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
HE DID NOT ENDURE THAT HARDSHIP

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
JUST SO A WOKE SCHOOL BOARD CAN

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
BEGIN TO SYSTEMATICALLY STRIP

03:32.000 --> 03:32.000
THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
HANDS OF PARENTS AND GUARDIANS

03:39.000 --> 03:39.000
O

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
TO DETERMINE WHAT TO HAPPENS

03:40.000 --> 03:40.000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
>> John: WOW.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
SO MADISON CAWTHORN THINKS THE

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
BIGGEST THREAT TO CHILDREN IS

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WHO THINK

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
THEY'RE OMNISCIENT.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I'D SAY I WAS SURPRISED,

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO ONCE

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
POSTED THIS VIDEO OF HIMSELF

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
BEATING UP A TREE.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
SO HE CLEARLY LOVES TO PICK

03:51.000 --> 03:51.000
USELESS FIGHTS AGAINST IMAGINARY

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
OPPONENTS WHERE HE COMES OUT

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
LOOKING LIKE A COMPLETE ASSHOLE.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
ALSO, A QUICK SIDE NOTE ABOUT

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
HIM BRAGGING ABOUT BEING

03:59.000 --> 03:59.000
A DESCENDANT OF

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
ABRAHAM KUYKENDALL.

04:01.000 --> 04:01.000
NOT ONLY DOES THAT LAST NAME

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
SOUND LIKE THE SWEDISH

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
TRANSLATION FOR BRATZ DOLLS,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
FOR THE RECORD,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
ABRAHAM KIRKENDALL -- WHICH IS

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
HOW IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED --

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
SLAVE OWNERS IN THE COUNTY.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
SO NEXT TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
PROVE A POINT ABOUT HOW PARENTS

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
SHOULD DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
THEIR KIDS, MAYBE DON'T USE

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
A GUY WHO DECIDED THE BEST THING

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS WAS FOR

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
HIM TO OWN THEM.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
AND THAT WAS BY NO MEANS

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
THE ONLY WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
HISTORICAL REFERENCE DURING

04:27.000 --> 04:27.000
A DEBATE THIS WEEK.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
>> JUST AFTER THE FOX CHAPEL

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
SCHOOL BOARD VOTED FOR STUDENTS

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
TO WEAR MASKS AS THE NEW SCHOOL

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
YEAR BEGINS, PEOPLE AT THE

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
MEETING STARTED ARGUING WITH

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
THE BOARD, BEFORE THIS PERSON

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
APPEARS TO FLASH A NAZI SALUTE

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
AT THE BOARD.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
THE HOLOCAUST CENTER OF

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
PITTSBURGH SAYS THERE IS

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
NO COMPARISON BETWEEN

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
THE HOLOCAUST AND MASKING

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
>> John: OKAY, I APPRECIATE

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
THE EFFORT, BUT YOU REALLY DID

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
NOT NEED TO ASK THE HOLOCAUST

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
CENTER TO FACT CHECK THAT.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
FOR THE SAME REASON YOU DON'T

04:53.000 --> 04:53.000
NEED TO CONTACT AN AFRICAN

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
STUDIES CENTER TO ASK IF

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE WAS AS

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
BAD AS GETTING A POPCORN KERNEL

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
STUCK IN YOUR TEETH.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
ANSWER, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
EITHER OF THE THINGS YOU'RE

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
COMPARING.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
AND LOOK, WHEN TEMPERS ARE THIS

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
HIGH, IT CAN BE HARD TO SORT

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
THINGS THROUGH IN A NUANCED WAY,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
BUT LET'S TRY.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
BECAUSE FIRST, WE CAN AGREE:

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
FOR MOST KIDS, IN-PERSON

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
SCHOOLING IS VASTLY PREFERABLE

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
TO THE ONLINE KIND.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
THE QUESTION IS, HOW TO DO IT

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
SAFELY.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
AND THOSE OPPOSED TO

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
MASK MANDATES ARGUE THAT,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
SINCE COVID CASES IN CHILDREN

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
HAVE TENDED TO BE MILD -- WHICH

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
IS, THANKFULLY, TRUE -- THE

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
DOWNSIDES OF THEM WEARING MASKS

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
BUT THAT IS A BIG SWING.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
THERE IS STILL SO MUCH WE DON'T

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
KNOW ABOUT HOW LONG-TERM COVID,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
AND THE DELTA VARIANT, AFFECT

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
KIDS.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
AND WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
COVID IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
DEADLY FOR ADULTS, AND IN MANY

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
COMMUNITIES, FOR SOME FUCKING

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
REASON, THERE ARE A LOT OF

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
UNVACCINATED ADULTS TO WHOM KIDS

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
COULD TRANSMIT THE VIRUS.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ANY OF

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
THAT NUANCE IS BEING FACTORED

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
INTO THIS DISCUSSION,

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE SCENES

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
LIKE PEOPLE BEING HARASSED

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
OUTSIDE THIS TENNESSEE SCHOOL

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
BOARD MEETING, WITH A MAN WHO

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
SPOKE IN FAVOR OF MASK

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
REQUIREMENTS BEING CONFRONTED

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
LIKE THIS:

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
>> EVERYBODY'S TAKING NOTES,

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
BUDDY!

06:04.000 --> 06:04.000
KEEP THAT LITTLE SMILE.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
>> WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE!

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
YOU CAN LEAVE FREELY BUT WE WILL

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
FIND YOU AND WE KNOW WHO YOU

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
ARE.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
IT'S GENUINELY HARD TO IMAGINE

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
A FIVE-WORD PHRASE LESS WELCOME

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
THAN "WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE,"

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
ASIDE FROM, OBVIOUSLY, "NEW

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
"JEOPARDY" HOST MIKE RICHARDS."

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING MASKS,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
IN AND OF THEMSELVES,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
ARE A PERFECT SHIELD AGAINST

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
TRANSMISSION.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
THEY'RE NOT!

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
EXPERTS ARGUE THEY SHOULD BE

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
PART OF A LAYERED APPROACH --

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
LIKE ENSURING PROPER VENTILATION

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
IN SCHOOLS, MAINTAINING SOCIAL

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
DISTANCING, AND REQUIRING THAT

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
EVERYONE IN A SCHOOL WHO CAN GET

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
A VACCINE DOES.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S NOT LIKE

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
SOME OF THESE STATES ARE SAYING,

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
"OKAY, WE'LL TAKE EVERY

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
REASONABLE PRECAUTION, EXCEPT

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
FOR MASKS."

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
BECAUSE IN TEXAS, THEY'RE DOING

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
THIS.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
>> THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY

06:53.000 --> 06:53.000
RELEASED NEW GUIDANCE REGARDING

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
COVID-19 AND SCHOOLS.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
UNDER THE NEW GUIDELINES,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
INFORM PARENTS OF A POSITIVE

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
CASE, SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE TO

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
CONDUCT CONTACT TRACING, AND

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
IF A SCHOOL DOES CONTACT TRACE,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
PARENTS CAN STILL SEND THEIR

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
CHILD TO SCHOOL IF THEY ARE

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
A CLOSE CONTACT OF AN INFECTED

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
STUDENT.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.000
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
DOING?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
THE PHRASE, "EVERYTHING'S BIGGER

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
IN TEXAS" IS SUPPOSED TO REFER

07:19.000 --> 07:19.000
TO MEAT, TRUCKS, AND BELT

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
BUCKLES, NOT "THE MARKET FOR

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
CHILD-SIZED VENTILATORS."

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
AND I KNOW SOME KIDS LITERALLY

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
CAN'T WEAR A MASK ALL DAY.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
BUT THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
THAT, UNTIL TRANSMISSION IS IN

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
CHECK, ANYONE WHO CAN, DOES.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
AND BOTH THE CDC AND THE

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
-- REPRESENTING NEARLY 70,000

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
DOCTORS -- ARE ARGUING FOR

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
UNIVERSAL INDOOR MASKING FOR

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
KIDS.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
AND THE THING IS, YOU CAN'T HELP

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
THINKING THAT SOME OF THE FUSS

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
OVER MASKS IS MORE ABOUT

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
PARENTS THAN IT IS ABOUT THEIR

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
KIDS.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
IN FACT, JUST WATCH AS ONE

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
BASICALLY ADMITS THAT.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.000
>> WELL, I MEAN, HONESTLY,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
IT'S JUST CRAZY.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I MEAN, LAST TIME I CHECKED,

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
THIS IS AMERICA, AND YOU CAN'T

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
MAKE ANYBODY DO ANYTHING.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I MEAN, I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
PEOPLE DIED FOR, OUR FREEDOM.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
LAST YEAR, HE DID HAVE TO WEAR

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
A MASK, AND YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
HE THINKS IT'S COOL.

08:07.000 --> 08:07.000
I'M GONNA JUST -- I'M NOT GONNA

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
LIE, YOU KNOW, HE THINKS HE'S A

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
NINJA.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
AND I SAY, "SON, DON'T -- DON'T

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
SAY THAT, WHEN THEY -- WHEN THEY

08:11.000 --> 08:11.000
ASK YOU IF YOU LIKE TO WEAR A

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
MASK."

08:12.000 --> 08:12.000
BUT, YOU KNOW.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
IT DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT HIM,

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I GUESS, RIGHT NOW, BUT,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S

08:16.000 --> 08:16.000
GOING ON.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
>> John: OH, COME ON!

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
IF YOUR KID HAPPENS TO LIKE

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
WEARING A MASK, LET THEM FUCKING

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
WEAR IT!

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
DO YOU REALIZE HOW RARE IT IS

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
FOR A CHILD TO VOLUNTARILY DO

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
SOMETHING THAT'S A NET POSITIVE

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
KIDS ARE NORMALLY JUST MOVING

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
SNOT DISPENSARIES THAT RUN

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
AROUND COUGHING ON DOOR KNOBS,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
AND SNEEZING DIRECTLY INTO

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
PEOPLE'S MOUTHS.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
LOOK, THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
IS THAT THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
WE CAN DO TO KEEP COVID FROM

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
SPREADING IN SCHOOLS ISN'T

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
SIMPLY PUTTING MASKS ON

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
CHILDREN.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
IT'S FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
SURROUNDING THAT SCHOOL TO BE

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
VACCINATED.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
FIRST LARGE WAVE OF COVID CASES

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
IN CHILDREN IS HITTING

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
LOW-VACCINATION STATES.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PROTECT

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
THE COMMUNITY THEY LIVE IN?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
HERE'S YOUR FUCKING ANSWER:

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
WE ARE ONLY FIGHTING ABOUT MASKS

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE THERE ARE

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
A BUNCH OF FOOLISH ADULTS THAT

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
HAVE DECIDED NOT TO GET THE

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
VACCINE.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
EVERYONE HATES, WHICH IS A

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
LITTLE WEIRD, AS IT'S GIVEN US

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE WERE

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
PROMISED IN THIS NEARLY

PRESCIENT AD FROM 1993.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
WAS ONE COMPANY THAT WOULD GO

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
THINGS THE INTERNET HAS ENABLED,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
AND THAT'S RANSOMWARE ATTACKS --

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
BASICALLY, INCIDENTS WHERE

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
HACKERS GET INTO A COMPUTER,

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
LOCK UP THE DATA, AND THEN FORCE

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
THE OWNERS TO PAY A RANSOM

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
IN ORDER TO UNLOCK IT.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
THEM RECENTLY.

BACK IN MAY, A RANSOMWARE ATTACK

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
FUEL ALONG THE EAST COAST.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
AND WHILE THE COMPANY STRESSED

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF GAS

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
AVAILABLE, JUST THE VERY IDEA

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SHORTAGE

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
LED TO CHAOS.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
>> THE LINES FOR GAS GETTING

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
LONGER, FROM THE CAROLINAS,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
DOWN TO FLORIDA,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
PANICKED DRIVERS OVERWHELMING

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
GAS STATIONS.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
DEMAND IS UP 40%.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
PRICES AT THE PUMP INCHING UP

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
TOO.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
>> I'LL SPEND THAT EXTRA

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
FEW BUCKS.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
GONNA BE A RUN ON GAS AND WE

12:24.000 --> 12:24.000
FIGURED I BETTER GET IT NOW.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
"THERE WON'T BE A RUN ON GAS

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
UNLESS EVERYONE IS AN IDIOT,

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
WHICH MEANS THERE'S DEFINITELY

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
GOING TO BE A RUN ON GAS,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
SO I MIGHT AS WELL BE A FASTER

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
EVERYTHING COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
ALL OF THE TIME.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
WAS TRULY REMARKABLE.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
AND THEN IN JULY, THE I.T.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
SOFTWARE COMPANY KASEYA GOT HIT

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
WITH AN EVEN BIGGER HACK.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
AND SINCE ITS JOB WAS TO PUSH

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
SOFTWARE TO OTHER COMPANIES,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
THAT MEANT THAT HUNDREDS OF

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
KASEYA'S CLIENTS, AND CLIENTS'

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000

CHAIN, A PUBLIC BROADCASTER,

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
SCHOOLS, AND A NATIONAL RAILWAY

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
SYSTEM WERE ALSO COMPROMISED.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "IS IT

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
JUST ME, OR DID THERE NOT USED

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
TO BE A MASSIVE RANSOMWARE

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
ATTACK EVERY TWO MONTHS?"

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, IT'S

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
GONE FROM A TRICKLE TO A FLOOD.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
THE ESTIMATED TOTAL RANSOMS PAID

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
QUADRUPLED TO $350 MILLION

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
LAST YEAR.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
AND THAT IS DEFINITELY AN

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
UNDERCOUNT, BECAUSE COMPANIES

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
OFTEN DON'T PUBLICLY DISCLOSE

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS, FOR FEAR OF

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
NEGATIVE PRESS OR LAWSUITS.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST COMPANIES

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
INVOLVED HERE.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
EVERYONE IS VULNERABLE TO

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
RANSOMWARE, EVEN THIS WOMAN.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
>> INNA SIMONE IS RETIRED.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
SHE'S A MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
FROM RUSSIA WHO NOW LIVES

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
OUTSIDE OF BOSTON.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
IN THE FALL OF 2014, HER HOME

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
COMPUTER STARTED ACTING

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
STRANGELY.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
INNA SAW DOZENS OF THESE

13:49.000 --> 13:49.000
MESSAGES.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
THEY WERE ALL THE SAME.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
THEY READ, "YOUR FILES ARE

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
ENCRYPTED.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
TO GET THE KEY TO DECRYPT THEM,

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
YOU HAVE TO PAY $500."

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
ALL HER FILES WERE LOCKED,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
TAX RETURNS, FINANCIAL PAPERS,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
LETTERS, EVEN THE PRECIOUS

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
PHOTOS OF HER GRANDDAUGHTER.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
TUESDAY AFTERNOON, THE FULL

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
RANSOM WAS SENT TO THE HACKERS'

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
ACCOUNT.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
INNA INSERTED ONE SHORT

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
MESSAGE TO THE CRIMINALS WITH

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
HER PAYMENT.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
>> I WROTE, "I WISH YOU ALL WILL

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
DROP DEAD."

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
>> John: YEAH.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
YOU ALMOST FORGOT THAT WOMAN

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
WAS GOING TO BE RUSSIAN

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
FOR A MOMENT, DIDN'T YOU?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
AND THEN SHE'S REALLY RUSSIAN.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
SHE IS ENJOYING HERSELF.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
YOU CAN TELL THIS ISN'T THE

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
FIRST TIME SHE'S WISHED DEATH

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
ON SOMEONE, AND ALSO, THAT THIS

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HER

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
WISH CAME TRUE.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
SO IF IT'S SO PERVASIVE,

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
IT'S AFFECTING PIPELINES AND

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
GRANDMOTHERS, WE THOUGHT

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
TONIGHT, WE'D TAKE A LOOK AT

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
RANSOMWARE, WHY IT'S ON THE

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
RISE, AND WHAT, IF ANYTHING,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
AND LET'S START WITH SOME

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
HISTORY.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
THE FIRST RANSOMWARE ATTACK

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
ACTUALLY OCCURRED BACK IN 1989,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
WHEN A MAN NAMED JOSEPH POPP

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
MAILED 20,000 FLOPPY DISKS TO

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
THAT HE CLAIMED CONTAINED AIDS

14:53.000 --> 14:53.000
RESEARCH.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
BUT WHEN THEY INSERTED THE DISK,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
THEIR COMPUTERS WERE INFECTED

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
WITH MALWARE, THEIR FILES WERE

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
LOCKED UP, AND THE PROGRAM

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
DEMANDED THEY MAIL $189

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
TO A P.O. BOX IN PANAMA.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
THAT'S RIGHT: THIS IS A

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
CYBERCRIME SO OLD, IT USED TO

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
REQUIRE A BUNCH OF FLOPPY DISKS

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
AND TWO PHYSICAL MAILMEN.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
OH, AND FUN FACT: AFTER BEING

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
ARRESTED, POPP CLAIMED IN COURT

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
THAT HE HAD PLANNED TO DONATE

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
THAT RANSOM MONEY TO AIDS

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
RESEARCH, WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
HE HAD STOLEN THAT MONEY

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
FROM AIDS RESEARCHERS

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
HE'S LIKE ROBIN HOOD,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
IF ROBIN HOOD HAD GONE AROUND

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
TAKING MONEY FROM THE POOR AND

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
PROMISING THE POOR HE'D GIVE IT

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
BACK LATER.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
BUT OBVIOUSLY, RANSOMWARE

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
DOESN'T COME IN VIA FLOPPY DISK

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
ANY MORE.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
INSTEAD, IT GETS INTO YOUR

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
SYSTEM THROUGH THE INTERNET,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
WITH A MESSAGE LIKE THIS.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
>> THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
WHEN YOU GET ATTACKED.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
IT SAYS, YOUR NETWORK HAS BEEN

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
INFECTED, RIGHT THERE IN BIG RED

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
TYPE.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
YOUR DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
ENCRYPTED.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
AND NOW TO GET THEM BACK,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
YOU HAVE TO PAY, IS WHAT THIS

15:52.000 --> 15:52.000
RANSOM NOTE IS TELLING YOU.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
THERE'S A COUNTDOWN CLOCK

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
THERE LETTING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
JUST LIMITED TIME HERE TO TAKE

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
ACTION AND PAY THESE HACKERS OR

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
ELSE THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO UP

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
AND YOU MIGHT NOT GET YOUR DATA

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
BACK.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT A

16:04.000 --> 16:04.000
MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEE

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
ON YOUR SCREEN.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
AND WHILE THEY'RE SCARY ENOUGH

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
IN THAT FORM, SOME ATTACKS CAN

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
BE CARTOONISHLY TERRIFYING.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
HERE'S ONE FEATURING

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
THE ANNABELLE DOLL.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
HERE'S ONE WITH THE PUPPET

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
FROM "SAW."

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
AND HERE'S ONE WITH

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE SCREAMING

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
"FUCK YOU" AND SAYING THE ONLY

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
WAY TO UNLOCK YOUR COMPUTER IS

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
TO SEND HIM AT LEAST TEN NUDES,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE IS A

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
REFERENCE TO THE UNAIRED FINAL

16:28.000 --> 16:28.000
EPISODE OF "THOMAS AND FRIENDS"

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
WHERE THEY INTRODUCED THOMAS TO

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
THE CONCEPT OF PORNOGRAPHY, AND

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
HE BECAME SO CRAZED BY IT, HE

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
HAD TO BE FORCIBLY DISASSEMBLED.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
THEY SAY IF YOU WANDER THE SODOR

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
SCRAPYARDS AT NIGHT, YOU CAN

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
HEAR THE WAILING OF A THOUSAND

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
SCATTERED PISTONS, STILL ALIVE

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
AND HOWLING FOR DICK PICS.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
SO THAT'S WHAT RANSOMWARE LOOKS

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
LIKE.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
BUT HOW MUCH HARM CAN IT DO?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
WELL, DEPENDING ON THE TARGET,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
A LOT.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
RANSOMWARE HAS CAUSED CHAOS IN

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
CITY GOVERNMENTS LIKE BALTIMORE

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
AND NEW ORLEANS.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
AND HACKERS HAVE ALSO HIT SCHOOL

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
DISTRICTS, POLICE DEPARTMENTS,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
AND EVEN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
>> LAST MONTH, A CYBERATTACK

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
TARGETING THE HOSPITAL CHAIN

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES CAUSED

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
A MAJOR COMPUTER FAILURE, WITH

17:07.000 --> 17:07.000
SOME OF ITS HOSPITALS FORCED TO

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
USE PEN AND PAPER TO FILE

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
PATIENT INFORMATION.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
>> SO THIS IS A PERFECT STORM

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
HITTING THE HOSPITALS, AND

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
THERE'S ACTUALLY NEVER BEEN

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
A BETTER TIME, IF YOU'RE A

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
RANSOMWARE SYNDICATE AND YOU

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
WANT A FAST PAYOUT, THIS WOULD

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
BE THE TIME TO STRIKE.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
>> John: HEY, THERESA,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
LOOK, I'M NO STRANGER TO

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
INADVERTENTLY GIVING

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE NEW WAYS

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
TO PREY ON THE VULNERABLE.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
THIS SEASON ALONE, WE'VE DONE

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
STORIES ON PREDATORY NURSING

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
HOMES, PACE LOAN SCAMS, AND

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
BASICALLY TOLD YOU HOW TO SET UP

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
A FAKE RELIGIOUS HEALTH

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
INSURANCE COMPANY.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
THIS SHOW COULD EASILY BE CALLED

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
"GETTING RICH FOR SOCIOPATHS"

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
WITH JOHN OLIVER.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
BUT I WILL SAY, AT LEAST I'VE

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
NEVER LOOK DEAD INTO CAMERA AND

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
TOLD HACKERS IT'S A GREAT TIME

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
TO TAKE DOWN A HOSPITAL.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
UNTIL, I GUESS, JUST NOW.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
WHAT HAVE YOU GOTTEN ME INTO,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
THERESA?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
AND TO BE FAIR, HACKERS DON'T

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
NEED MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
LAST YEAR, OVER 500 HEALTHCARE

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
FACILITIES WERE HIT BY

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
IN THE U.S. ALONE.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
ONE OF WHICH WAS IN VERMONT,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
WHERE CLINICIANS WERE FORCED TO

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
TURN AWAY HUNDREDS OF CANCER

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
PATIENTS WHO NEEDED TREATMENT

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
AFTER THEY LOST ACCESS TO

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
MEDICAL RECORDS.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
AND THE THING IS, HACKERS DON'T

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
NECESSARILY HAVE TO WORK TOO

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
HARD TO DO THIS.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
ABOUT 85% OF HOSPITALS DON'T

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
HAVE A SINGLE QUALIFIED

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
CYBERSECURITY PERSON ON STAFF,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
WHICH DOES FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST

18:24.000 --> 18:24.000
ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
IN FACT, LAX SECURITY IS A

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
PROBLEM ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
THE COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
OCCURRED BECAUSE AN EMPLOYEE HAD

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
USED THE SAME PASSWORD ACROSS

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
MULTIPLE SERVICES, AND THE

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
COMPANY DIDN'T USE MULTI-FACTOR

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
AUTHENTICATION.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
SO WHEN THAT PASSWORD WAS

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
BREACHED IN AN ATTACK ELSEWHERE,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
THERE WAS A DIRECT WAY IN.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
AND WHEN PRESSED ON WHAT

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
HAPPENED, COLONIAL'S CEO WASN'T

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
PARTICULARLY REASSURING.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
>> IN THE CASE OF THIS

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
PARTICULAR LEGACY VPN, IT DID

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
ONLY HAVE SINGLE-FACTOR

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
AUTHENTICATION, IT WAS A

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
COMPLICATED PASSWORD, SO I WANT

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
TO BE CLEAR ON THAT, IT WAS NOT

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
A "COLONIAL 123"-TYPE PASSWORD.

19:05.000 --> 19:05.000
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
NO ONE SAID IT WAS!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE EXPECTATIONS

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
YOU THINK YOU'RE MEETING WITH

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
THAT ANSWER.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
THE ONLY PEOPLE I'D EVEN SUSPECT

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
OF USING "COLONIAL123" AS A

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
PASSWORD ARE THE STAFF AT

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG, AND

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE AGGRESSIVELY

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
SUCKING AT CYBERSECURITY WOULD

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
AT LEAST BE HISTORICALLY

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
ACCURATE.

19:21.000 --> 19:21.000
AND HERE'S THE THING,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
EVEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
SCRUPULOUS ABOUT BACKING UP DATA

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
SO IT CAN BE EASILY RECOVERED

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
CAN STILL BE VULNERABLE.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
BECAUSE HACKERS ARE NOW NOT JUST

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
ENCRYPTING DATA, THEY'RE ALSO

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
THREATENING TO RELEASE FILES OR

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
PERSONAL INFORMATION PUBLICLY.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
THIS HAPPENED TO THE D.C. POLICE

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
RECENTLY WHEN HACKERS RELEASED

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF 22

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
OFFICERS.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
AND A FEW YEARS AGO, HBO WAS

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
HIT, TOO, WITH HACKERS DEMANDING

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
AROUND $6 MILLION OR THEY'D LEAK

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
UNAIRED EPISODES OF

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
"GAME OF THRONES."

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
WHICH, TO BE HONEST, IS A PRETTY

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
WEAK THREAT.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
IF HBO'S GOING TO BE PUBLICLY

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
HUMILIATED, IT WILL BE BY

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
RELEASING THE LAST SEASON OF

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
"GAME OF THRONES" ON ITS OWN

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
TERMS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
AND IF HAVING YOUR DATA LOCKED

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
OR LEAKED WEREN'T SCARY ENOUGH,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
IT ACTUALLY GETS WORSE.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
BECAUSE WE'RE INCREASINGLY

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
HOOKING PHYSICAL OBJECTS IN OUR

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
LIVES UP TO THE INTERNET --

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
THINGS LIKE TVs, REFRIGERATORS,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
AND OVENS.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
AND THEY CAN BE VULNERABLE TO

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
RANSOMWARE, TOO.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
BACK IN 2016, HACKERS MADE

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
THE FIRST-EVER RANSOMWARE FOR

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
SMART THERMOSTATS, CRANKING

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
THE TEMPERATURE TO 99 DEGREES

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
UNLESS THE OWNER PAID UP.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
AND LAST YEAR, RESEARCHERS FOUND

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
A VULNERABILITY IN AN

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
INTERNET-ENABLED CHASTITY CAGE

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
-- BASICALLY A HIGH-TECH PENIS

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
PRISON -- THAT COULD BE

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
COCK-LOCKED UNTIL THE PERSON

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
IN JUNK JAIL PAID UP.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
AND INTERESTINGLY, THE

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
RESEARCHERS WHO DISCOVERED THAT

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
FELT COMPELLED TO GO PUBLIC WITH

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
IT BECAUSE OF THE NEXT PRODUCT

20:40.000 --> 20:40.000
THAT COMPANY WAS ABOUT TO

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
RELEASE.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
>> HI THERE!

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
WE'RE INTRODUCING YOU TO

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
PEAR FLOWER ANAL PLUG.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
COMPATIBLE TO VARIOUS TEALS AND

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
LEASH.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
YOU NEED TO SELECT TO BE

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
"KEYMASTER" OR "WEARER."

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
WEARER CAN ADD FRIENDS IN THE

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
APP, AND INVITE FRIENDS TO BE

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
KEYMASTER.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
THIS INVITED KEYMASTER HAS RIGHT

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
TO GIVE PERMISSION TO WEARER FOR

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
UNLOCKING.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
WEARER CANNOT UNLOCK WITHOUT

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
PERMISSION FROM KEYMASTER.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
>> John: YEAH, THAT PRODUCT

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
COULD ESSENTIALLY GIVE THE

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
INTERNET CONTROL OVER YOUR ANUS,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
WHICH DOESN'T SEEM GREAT.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
ASSHOLES ARE LIKE OPINIONS:

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
LETTING THE INTERNET BE IN

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
CHARGE OF YOURS IS A REALLY

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
BAD IDEA.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
NOW, INCREDIBLY, I LEGALLY HAVE

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
TO TELL YOU AT THIS POINT:

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
THAT BUTT PLUG DOES COME WITH

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
A PHYSICAL KEY FOR EMERGENCIES.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
WHICH I AM NOT SURE IS

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
COMPLETELY REASSURING.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
KEYS DO GET LOST, DON'T THEY?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
JUST PICTURE THE LAST TIME

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
YOU SEARCHED FOR YOUR KEYS

21:35.000 --> 21:35.000
AROUND YOUR HOUSE AND

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
NOW RAISE THE STAKES

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
SIGNIFICANTLY.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
THE POINT IS, THE COSTS OF

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
RANSOMWARE KEEP GETTING HIGHER

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
AND HIGHER, EVEN AS, CRUCIALLY,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
THE BARRIER TO ENTRY HAS GOTTEN

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
MUCH LOWER.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
BECAUSE THE EXPLOSION IN

21:46.000 --> 21:46.000
RANSOMWARE HAS BASICALLY BEEN

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
THE RESULT OF THREE MAJOR

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
DEVELOPMENTS.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
THE FIRST ONE IS THE EMERGENCE

21:50.000 --> 21:50.000
OF SOMETHING CALLED

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
"RANSOMWARE AS A SERVICE."

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
BASICALLY, HACKERS WILL DEVELOP

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
A RANSOMWARE PROGRAM, AND THEN

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
SELL IT TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AND SPLIT

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
THE PROFITS.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
WHAT THIS MEANS IS, BASICALLY

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
ANYONE CAN LAUNCH AN ATTACK,

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
TECH-SAVVY -- IN FACT, JUST

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
WATCH AS A CYBERSECURITY EXPERT

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
WALKS THROUGH THE FEATURES

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
OFFERED BY ONE RANSOMWARE

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
VENDOR.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
>> THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
WITH BASICALLY A CHAT ROOM,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
WHERE YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS TO

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
THE PEOPLE WHO MAINTAIN THIS

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
ARCHITECTURE FOR YOU.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
>> FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
FOR CRIMINALS.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
>> EXACTLY.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
>> TOM PACE LOGGED ONTO THE SITE

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
AND USED IT TO ENCRYPT A NETWORK

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
OF HIS OWN.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
>> SO ALL OF THE FILES THAT ARE

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
ON THIS SYSTEM HAVE NOW BEEN

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
SUCCESSFULLY ENCRYPTED.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
>> SO THIS TOOK YOU JUST

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
SLIGHTLY OVER FIVE MINUTES,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
AND YOU DIDN'T WRITE A SINGLE

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
LINE OF CODE?

22:42.000 --> 22:42.000
>> CORRECT.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
>> OFF THE SHELF.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
>> OFF THE SHELF.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
READY TO GO.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
>> John: THAT IS ALARMINGLY

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
EASY!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
IDEALLY, NO ONE WOULD LAUNCH

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
BUT MY NEXT PREFERENCE WOULD BE

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
THAT LAUNCHING ONE SHOULD

22:55.000 --> 22:55.000
REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WORK

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
THAN SIMPLY CLICKING

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
"ADD RANSOMWARE TO CART."

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
IF IT'S BEGINNING TO SEEM LIKE

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
RANSOMWARE IS JUST A TYPICAL

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
BUSINESS, BUT STAFFED BY

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
CRIMINALS, YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
WRONG.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
THIS CAN BE A VERY PROFESSIONAL

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
ENTERPRISE, WITH CUSTOMER CARE

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
FOR BOTH THE CRIMINAL WHO BOUGHT

23:11.000 --> 23:11.000
THE RANSOMWARE PRODUCT, AND THE

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
VICTIM ON THE RECEIVING END OF

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
IT.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
ONE EXPERT EVEN SAID, "HONESTLY,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
I WISH MY INTERNET SERVICE

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
PROVIDER HAD CUSTOMER SERVICE

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
THE WAY THESE GUYS DO."

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE UNFAIR,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
SINCE RANSOMWARE HACKERS ARE

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
CRIMINALS AND INTERNET SERVICE

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
PROVIDERS ARE FUCKING MONSTERS.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
YOU CAN'T HOLD THEM TO THE SAME

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
STANDARDS.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
AND FOR A SENSE OF THE CUSTOMER

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
SERVICE THEY OFFER FOR VICTIMS,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
REMEMBER THAT GRANDMOTHER?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
THE PEOPLE THAT HACKED HER WERE

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
HAPPY TO HELP GUIDE HER THROUGH

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
THE PROCESS OF PAYMENT.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
>> IN THEIR RANSOM NOTE, THE

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
HACKERS WANTED TO BE PAID IN

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
BITCOIN, THE LARGELY UNTRACEABLE

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
DIGITAL CURRENCY, AND HAVE IT

23:46.000 --> 23:46.000
PUT INTO THEIR ANONYMOUS

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
ACCOUNT.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
INNA HAD NEVER HEARD OF BITCOIN,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
BUT THE HACKERS, IN ONE OF THEIR

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
MANY TOUCHES OF WHAT YOU MIGHT

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE, PROVIDED

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
ALL SORTS OF HELPFUL FACTS AND

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
LINKS AND HOW-TO GUIDES ABOUT

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
BITCOIN.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
>> John: IT'S TRUE!

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
THEY HAD TO TEACH

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
INNA HOW TO USE BITCOIN.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
THAT IS GENUINELY WAY MORE

24:10.000 --> 24:10.000
IMPRESSIVE THAN CARRYING OUT A

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
RANSOMWARE ATTACK.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
CLICK

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
THINK ABOUT IT, IF YOU HAD TO

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
TEACH YOUR GRANDMA TO USE

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
CRYPTOCURRENCY IN ORDER TO MAKE

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
$500, ARE YOU CONFIDENT YOU

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
WOULD WALK OUT OF THERE WITH

24:22.000 --> 24:22.000
$500?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
LET'S SAY YOU HAD INFINITE TIME

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
AND INFINITE GRANDMAS.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND BITCOIN,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TEACH A

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
GRANDMA, ANY GRANDMA, TO USE IT.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GETTING $500

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
OUT OF THAT SITUATION?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
DEEP DOWN, I THINK YOU KNOW THE

24:33.000 --> 24:33.000
ANSWER TO THAT.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
BUT THE BITCOIN PART OF THAT

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
STORY ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
THE SECOND MAJOR DRIVER OF

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
RANSOMWARE, AND THAT'S THE RISE

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
THEY'VE MADE IT MUCH EASIER TO

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
MAKE MONEY FROM RANSOMWARE,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
AND MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR LAW

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
ENFORCEMENT TO RECOVER PAYMENTS.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
BECAUSE IF RANSOMS WERE PAID IN

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
WIRE TRANSFERS, COMPANIES COULD

24:50.000 --> 24:50.000
FIND A WAY TO CLAW THAT MONEY

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
BACK.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
BUT WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDO.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
AND WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

24:57.000 --> 24:57.000
ACTUALLY DID MANAGE TO RECOVER

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
SOME OF THE BITCOIN USED

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE RANSOM,

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
THERE ARE OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES

25:02.000 --> 25:02.000
DESIGNED TO BE EVEN MORE

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
ANONYMOUS.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
TAKE MONERO, WHICH IN ITS ADS,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
SEEMS TO BE AWARE OF JUST HOW

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
ATTRACTIVE IT IS TO CRIMINALS.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
>> THERE'S NO SAFE PLACE TO

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
CONDUCT PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
WELL, THERE WASN'T ONE,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
UNTIL NOW.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
MEET MONERO.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
MONERO IS A SECURE, PRIVATE,

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
UNTRACEABLE CURRENCY.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
WITH MONERO, YOU ARE YOUR OWN

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
BANK.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
ONLY YOU CONTROL AND ARE

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FUNDS.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
MONERO IS PRIVATE.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
>> THIS MEANS BUSINESSES CAN

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
KEEP THEIR SUPPLIERS IN SECRET,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
AS WELL AS CITIZENS ESCAPE

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
GOVERNMENT REPRESSIONS, AND NOSY

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
NEIGHBORS OR CROOKS.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
>> John: OH, COME ON.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
THERE'S A PRETTY CLEAR SUBTEXT

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
TO WHAT THEY'RE SELLING THERE.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
IT'S LIKE SEEING A CHEERFUL AD

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
FOR "PLASTIC TUBS THE SIZE AND

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
SHAPE OF A HUMAN BODY."

25:49.000 --> 25:49.000
THIS ISN'T FOR ANYTHING IN

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
PARTICULAR!

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF HUMAN

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
BODY-SIZED THINGS YOU COULD PUT

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
INTO ONE OF THESE STURDY TUBS!

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
ALSO, THEY'RE SCREAM PROOF!

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
"NO MATTER HOW MUCH SOUND

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
SOMETHING MAKES INSIDE,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
YOU'LL NEVER HEAR IT!"

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
WITH OUR PRODUCT, THOUGH --

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
ALTHOUGH, INTERESTINGLY, DESPITE

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
THE FACT HACKERS NOW HAVE THE

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR FINANCIAL

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
TRANSACTIONS IN SECRET, IT'S NOT

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
ALWAYS THAT HARD TO FIGURE OUT

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000

26:16.000 --> 26:16.000

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
EVIL CORP, SHOWING OFF AN

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
EXPENSIVE LAMBORGHINI IN A

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
PARKING GARAGE.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
THIS IS VIDEO OF EVIL CORP

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
MEMBERS ALLEGEDLY DOING DONUTS

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
AND OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC IN

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
DOWNTOWN MOSCOW.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
LARGE, POSING WITH ARMS FULL OF

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
CASH, AND SHOWING OFF A PET LION

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
CUB.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
>> THIS IS 32-YEAR-OLD

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
MAKSIM YAKUBETS WITH HIS

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
PERSONALIZED NUMBER PLATES,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
WHICH IN RUSSIAN READS "THIEF."

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
>> John: WOW.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
THESE GUYS ARE DOUCHES.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
IT'S BAD ENOUGH SITTING

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
IN A TRAFFIC JAM WATCHING SOME

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
ASSHOLE DO DONUTS IN THE MIDDLE

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
OF THE STREET WITHOUT HAVING TO

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
WONDER IF THERE'S A LION CUB

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
THROWING UP IN THE CAR.

27:03.000 --> 27:03.000
C'MON, GUYS.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
LEAVE LIONS OUT OF THIS.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
A WEIRD ANIMAL, GET A BIG SNAKE.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I COULD GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
A BIG SNAKE'S QUALITY OF LIFE.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
AND YOU CAN TELL ANY BIG SNAKE

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I SAID THAT.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A REASON

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
THOSE HACKERS FEEL SO

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
COMFORTABLE DRIVING AROUND WITH

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
LICENSE PLATES THAT ARE

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
BASICALLY AN ADMISSION OF GUILT,

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
AND THAT'S BRINGS US TO

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
THE FINAL FACTOR INCREASING

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS, AND THAT'S

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
COUNTRIES PROVIDING SAFE HAVENS.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
BECAUSE MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTS --

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
AND RUSSIA, IN PARTICULAR --

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
WILL LOOK THE OTHER WAY FOR

27:34.000 --> 27:34.000
HACKERS

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
SO LONG AS THEY DO

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
THEIR WORK OUTSIDE OF THEIR

27:37.000 --> 27:37.000
BORDERS.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
CYBERSECURITY EXPERTS SAY THE

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
"DON'T WORK IN .RU" STRICTURE

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
HAS BECOME AN UNWRITTEN RULE

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
IN THE RUSSIAN-SPEAKING HACKING

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
COMMUNITY, TO AVOID

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
ENTANGLEMENTS WITH RUSSIAN

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
BASICALLY, RUSSIAN HACKERS KNOW,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T MAKE

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
TROUBLE AT HOME, THEY WON'T BE

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
PUNISHED FOR WHAT THEY DO

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
ABROAD.

27:55.000 --> 27:55.000
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
TOGETHER, WITH CYBERCRIMINALS

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
ABLE TO BUY RANSOMWARE OFF THE

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
SHELF, GET PAID IN UNTRACEABLE

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
CURRENCY, AND WORK FREE FROM

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
STATE INTERFERENCE, IS IT ANY

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
WONDER WE HAVE SUCH A MASSIVE

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE KEY

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
QUESTION -- WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
THIS?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
WELL, HERE'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
>> WE OUGHT TO PASS A LAW

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
IMMEDIATELY THAT MAKES IT --

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
THIS KIND OF HACKING SUBJECT TO

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
A DEATH PENALTY, AND THE LAW

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
SHOULD INCLUDE A PROVISION THAT

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
THE PRESIDENT, THROUGH A

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
JUDICIAL PROCESS, SHOULD BE ABLE

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
TO ORDER THE KILLING OF ANYBODY

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
OVERSEAS WHO IS DOING THIS.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
>> John: WOW.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
THAT'S BOTH INCREDIBLY HARSH AND

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
ALSO ENDEARINGLY NAIVE.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
BECAUSE I HATE TO BREAK IT TO

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
NEWT, BUT AMERICA DOESN'T

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
EXACTLY CONCERN ITSELF WITH

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
"A JUDICIAL PROCESS" TO KILL

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
PEOPLE OVERSEAS.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
WE VERY MUCH TAKE

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
THE SANTA CLAUS APPROACH:

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
SEE THEM WHEN THEY'RE SLEEPING,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
KNOW WHEN THEY'RE AWAKE, MAKE A

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
LIST OF WHO'S BEEN BAD OR GOOD,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
AND THEN KILL SOME BAD ONES,

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
AND WHICHEVER GOOD ONES HAPPEN

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
TO BE AROUND THEM.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
YOU KNOW, FOR GOODNESS' SAKE.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
SO THAT IS ONE EXTREME WAY TO

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
HANDLE THIS.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
HOWEVER, HAS SO FAR TAKEN A

29:01.000 --> 29:01.000
DIFFERENT TACK.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
IN THE WAKE OF THE COLONIAL

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
HACK, THIS WAS THE MESSAGE THEY

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
WERE PUBLICLY SENDING.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
>> WE RECOGNIZE THAT VICTIMS OF

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
CYBERATTACKS OFTEN FACE A VERY

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
DIFFICULT SITUATION, AND THEY

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
HAVE TO JUST BALANCE, OFTEN,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
THE COST-BENEFIT WHEN THEY HAVE

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
NO CHOICE WITH REGARD TO PAYING

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
A RANSOM.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
COLONIAL IS A PRIVATE COMPANY,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
AND WE'LL DEFER INFORMATION

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
REGARDING THEIR DECISION ON

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
PAYING A RANSOM TO THEM.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
>> John: OKAY, SO YOU'D LIKE

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
THEM TO PAY THE RANSOM.

29:26.000 --> 29:26.000
YOU'D LIKE THE GAS BACK, AND

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
THE EASIEST WAY TO GET

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
THE GAS BACK IS TO PAY

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
THE RANSOM, SO YOU'D LIKE THEM

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
TO PAY THE RANSOM.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
IT'S A PRETTY STRONG HINT, AND

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IF THE

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
HINT DOESN'T WORK, JOE BIDEN IS

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
GOING TO TAKE THEIR COMPUTER AND

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
PAY FOR THEM.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
IF THAT RUSSIAN GRANDMA CAN

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE BITCOIN,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
THERE'S A 30% CHANCE JOE CAN

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
TOO.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A MIDDLE

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
GROUND BETWEEN "JUST KILL THEM"

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
AND "JUST PAY THEM."

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
BECAUSE MOST PUNISHMENTS -- AND

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
THIS IS TRUE -- FALL SOMEWHERE

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
BETWEEN "DEATH SENTENCE" AND

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
"A CASH REWARD."

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
AND THE PROBLEM IS, THE MORE WE

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
PAY, THE MORE THESE KINDS OF

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
ATTACKS WILL BE ENCOURAGED,

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
AND THE MORE WELL-FUNDED THEY

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
END UP BEING.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
SO MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
HERE -- AND I WILL SAY, ON THE

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
GOVERNMENT LEVEL, THERE ARE SOME

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
ENCOURAGING SIGNS.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
CALLED A TAX FORCED TO CURTAIL

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
THE PROLIFERATION OF RANSOMWARE

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
ATTACKS, DOES FEEL A LITTLE LATE

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
TO BE FORMING A TASK FORCE BUT

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
IT IS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
NEVER.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
ALSO THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
A BILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPROVING

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
THE CYBERSECURITY OF LOCAL

30:27.000 --> 30:27.000
GOVERNMENTS.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
BUT THE THING IS,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
IT'S NOT JUST UP TO THE

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CYBERSECURITY

30:31.000 --> 30:31.000
A LOT MORE SERIOUSLY.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
COMPANIES AND PRIVATE

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO STEP UP,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
TOO.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
AND THERE ARE SOME BASIC THINGS

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
THAT WE SHOULD ALL ABSOLUTELY

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
BE DOING.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
FIRST, SET UP MULTI-FACTOR

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
NOW!

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
SECOND, KEEP YOUR COMPUTERS UP

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
TO DATE, AND ALSO, DON'T CLICK

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
ON SUSPICIOUS EMAILS.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
AND I KNOW THAT THOSE MEASURES

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
SOUND SMALL WHEN WE'RE FACING

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
SOMETHING SO TERRIFYING.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
BUT IN A WORLD WHERE MOST

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
