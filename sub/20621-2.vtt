00:43.752 --> 00:45.545
DiGiorno, Captain!

00:45.628 --> 00:47.005
- Arnold!
- Ha ha!

00:47.088 --> 00:49.674
Ha ha!

00:49.758 --> 00:52.093
What are you doing here? I thought
you were coming in the afternoon.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.512
I took an earlier flight. I
wanted to surprise you, bud.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.056
Wait, my landlord said there's
a beautiful woman downstairs.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.933
I told him to say that.
I thought it'd be cute.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.936
Ugh, I met this girl the other
day, and I lost her phone number.

01:01.978 --> 01:02.937
I thought it was her.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.273
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Just me.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.442
Guess my cute prank
took a dark turn.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.402
Anyway, Arnie's in Italia.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.946
Let's get those jammies off, and
let's get some tasty treats.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.324
Certol That means "of course."

01:56.699 --> 01:59.536
So this is Mercato Albinelli.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.164
It's where I get all my produce,
meats, cheeses, everything.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.791
- It's the best.
- Wow, it's amazing.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.668
It's like an Italian
wonderland in here.

02:06.751 --> 02:07.627
I know.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.510
Ooh.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.428
Try one of these.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.889
Mmm.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.226
Mamma mia, these
strawberries are bomb, Cap!

02:23.309 --> 02:25.603
So what's the deal? Can
you just try anything?

02:25.728 --> 02:28.273
Or are then you known as
a try-and-not-buy guy?

02:28.356 --> 02:29.691
'Cause Arnie wants to try,

02:29.774 --> 02:31.192
but I know you got a
rep in this town.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.318
I don't want to tarn that name.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.361
No, no, we can try.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.656
So should
we just become Italians?

02:37.657 --> 02:39.993
I mean, I'm so America'd
out right now.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.202
Are you gonna stay here forever?

02:41.286 --> 02:44.163
Well, I'm done with my
apprenticeship at the pasta shop,

02:44.247 --> 02:46.291
and after our buds weekend,

02:46.374 --> 02:48.877
I can either keep working there,
or I can go back to New York.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.628
- I haven't really decided.
- Yeah.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.921
Ooh, you got to try this cheese.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.089
Ooh, yeah.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.550
Ciao.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.136
Mmm.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.013
Oh!

03:00.096 --> 03:02.390
So what's up with Rachel?
Do you guys talk?

03:02.473 --> 03:06.019
Well, about a month or so ago, I told
her I thought it's best if probably

03:06.102 --> 03:07.228
we didn't really talk anymore.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.104
Yeah.

03:08.187 --> 03:10.440
She emailed me last
week for my birthday,

03:10.523 --> 03:12.108
and we've been texting
a little bit.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.027
You guys think you'll
ever get back together?

03:14.110 --> 03:15.278
I don't know.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.238
But it was fun to flirt and
joke around with someone.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.740
I got no girls here.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.033
Yeah, you got not girls,

03:20.116 --> 03:22.076
but you got some amazing bites.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.703
So what do you want to do next?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.748
I mean, I pretty much just
plan on us eating all day

03:26.831 --> 03:28.207
with very minimal breaks.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.208
I'm into it.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.337
I downed a whole bottle of
Pepcid AC on the plane.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.380
I'm all pepped up
and ready to go.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.132
Andiamo.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.636
♪ Eating in Italy
is my favorite thing ♪

03:39.719 --> 03:42.597
♪ Eating in Italy is
my favorite thing ♪

03:42.680 --> 03:44.557
Dude, so what's
going on with you?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.851
How's everything in New York?
What's the lady situation?

03:46.935 --> 03:49.354
To be honest with you, man,
Arnold is a menace right now.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.522
I signed up for all the
online dating stuff,

03:51.606 --> 03:52.649
and it's totally working.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.359
So you're just hooking
up all the time?

03:54.442 --> 03:56.235
I mean, yeah, but it's
not just about the sex.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.779
I'm meeting amazing people.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.239
Check out this girl Kristen.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.741
- Bella!
- I know.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.284
She's an artist. She
makes me laugh.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.452
She's gorge.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.496
She actually took me
on a trip upstate.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.748
We fed a duck. I fell
out of a tire swing.

04:08.831 --> 04:09.874
I'm in love.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.168
Ooh, by the way, can you
take a video for me?

04:12.251 --> 04:14.045
Sure.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.176
- How's it look?
- Good.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.887
Oh, this is perfect!

04:22.971 --> 04:24.806
I'm gonna send it to her.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.850
"Hi, cutie."

04:29.811 --> 04:30.812
Does that really work?

04:30.853 --> 04:32.814
Dude, who wouldn't want
to date this guy'?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.774
He loves food. He loves travel.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.109
He's devilishly handsome,

04:36.192 --> 04:38.319
and he knows how to do a
classic wave and kiss.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.489
So you're getting pretty
serious about her?

04:41.572 --> 04:43.408
I'm not trying to get serious
with anyone right now, really.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.202
I'm just playing the
field, seeing new people,

04:46.285 --> 04:47.954
going on some adventures.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.957
I mean, look at
this girl, Candace.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.251
- Mamma mia!
- I met her on Tall Boys.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.753
It's an app for girls that
want to date big boys like me.

04:55.837 --> 04:56.921
I'm cleaning up.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.340
I'm way bigger than most
of the guys on there.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.009
Check out my profile pic.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.095
Hey, don't put me in
your Tall Boys profile!

05:04.178 --> 05:07.306
Come on, Dev, big bud needs
little bud for perspective.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.058
You make me look huge.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.518
All right, but if they
make a Little Boys app,

05:10.601 --> 05:11.561
I'm using that same pic.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.355
Then again, probably shouldn't get
on an app called Little Boys.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.316
Ooh, I'm gonna send
her the "hi, cutie."

05:17.400 --> 05:18.943
Hi, cutie!

05:19.027 --> 05:20.486
Wait, you're sending
that girl the same GIF?

05:20.570 --> 05:21.612
They're all getting
"hi, cuties"?

05:21.696 --> 05:24.115
Well, I want to say hi, and
they're definitely all cuties.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.283
Let me make you one.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.201
All right.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.786
And go.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.458
That's great!

05:34.709 --> 05:36.753
Wait. Check this out.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.337
That's pretty good.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.006
Maybe I can send it to Brian.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.342
Everything all set for Tuscany?

05:43.426 --> 05:44.552
Yep, everything's in order.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.763
We got the Airbnb,
the rental car.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.057
I got some thoughts on
that new Danish TV series

05:49.140 --> 05:50.475
everyone's talking about.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.143
- We have to discuss that.
- Sure.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.936
And all your wedding
stuffs on Saturday, right?

05:53.978 --> 05:56.272
Yeah, not too much
time away from my cap.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.649
Are you sure you don't
want to be my plus-one?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.777
Yeah, I'm not a huge
"strangers' wedding" guy.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.154
I'll just grab a nice
solo dinner somewhere.

06:03.237 --> 06:06.324
Is that code for staying in and
jerking off at the Airbnb?

06:06.407 --> 06:08.576
Uh, no, can't jerk
off in Airbnbs.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.119
Why? You jerk off at hotels.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.829
It's different. This
is someone's home.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.248
Agree to disagree.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.678
- Ah, there it is.
- Wow.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.932
Osteria Francescana, the number-one
restaurant in the world.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.351
Dude, we got to check this
place out while we're in town.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.393
Pfft. Believe me,
I've been trying.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.395
They're booked up for,
like, the next ten years.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.688
That's why it's crazy...

06:37.772 --> 06:39.857
I got you a resy as
a birthday gift.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.360
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, tomorrow night.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.402
How? How? How?

06:43.486 --> 06:46.030
You know my Aunt Edeltraud
supplies the meat slicers here.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.075
Baumheiser Slicers are the
best in the biz, baby,

06:49.158 --> 06:50.493
and she knows Chef Massimo.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.619
She hooked it up.

06:51.702 --> 06:52.912
- You're serious?
- Yes!

06:52.995 --> 06:54.247
- Big bud and little bud are eating here?
- Yes!

06:54.330 --> 06:56.833
- I'm freaking out.
- We're in! We're in!

06:56.916 --> 06:59.210
We're in! We're in!
We're in!

06:59.293 --> 07:00.211
I'm gonna need a bud bump.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.212
Come on in!

07:01.295 --> 07:02.463
Boing!

07:02.547 --> 07:04.298
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.967
So first course...

07:06.050 --> 07:08.553
lentils, almost
better than caviar.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.263
Ah!

07:10.346 --> 07:11.931
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.350
Next course...
autumn in New York.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.644
I gave the shape of a apple,
like the Big Apple...

07:16.727 --> 07:17.937
Oh, whoa.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.273
...with an extraction of
mushroom and truffle.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.527
Oh, God! Oh, oh, oh!

07:24.610 --> 07:27.572
Next is my plate.
It's tortellini.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.658
One is very small, and this
is a little bit bigger.

07:30.741 --> 07:31.576
Grazie.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.994
It's like the little
bud, big bud of pasta.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.663
Mmm.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.956
This is me before.
This is me now.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.082
I've peaked.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.793
♪ Francescana
is my favorite place ♪

07:40.877 --> 07:43.880
♪ Francescana is my
favorite place ♪

07:45.798 --> 07:47.175
Wow.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.969
Mmm.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.973
All right, I need to, like, step out
for a little bit of air for a sec.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.099
I'll be right back.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.475
Okay.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.810
Is it okay if I finish this?

07:57.894 --> 07:58.978
No!

08:07.528 --> 08:09.113
Hi, cutie.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.846
Fuck.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.903
Ooh, so the Wedding's
near this town called Pienza.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.990
It's supposed to have the
most amazing Pecorino cheese.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.491
And you know what
else I heard is cool?

09:35.574 --> 09:37.576
Is, like, renting scooters and
just riding through the--

09:37.660 --> 09:39.578
I'm sorry, man. Can we
talk about this later?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.789
I get a little nervous driving
in these small towns.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.874
Sure, sure. No problem.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.379
- All right.
- Wait, so we take a left here?

09:48.462 --> 09:52.341
Mm, yeah, GPS says take
a left down this alley.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.725
I don't know, Cap. It
looks pretty tight.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.019
Yeah, uh, you know what?
Let's back up.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.603
Let me double-check the GPS.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.731
Maybe it thinks we're
in a different spot.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.524
I'll refresh.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.446
No, it says we're supposed
to make this left.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.534
Whoa.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.786
Well, that truck
just ripped through.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.621
I think we'll be fine. Let's
just fold the mirrors in.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.415
Okay.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.541
Let's go.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.631
Just take it slow.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.300
Looking good.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.385
Slow, slow.
You're good on this side.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.888
It's really tight
over here, man.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.598
Uh, y-you got a
little space here.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.224
Just go to the right
a little bit.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.851
- Easy, easy.
- We got room over there?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.603
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You sure?

10:45.728 --> 10:46.937
W-wait, wait, wait.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.815
Ooh, yah.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.858
Keep going.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.526
I can't! We're fucking stuck!

10:52.610 --> 10:53.986
What? Shit.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.321
I thought you said we're
good on that side.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.198
But then I said,
"Wait, wait, wait."

10:57.281 --> 10:58.491
What the fuck do we do?

10:58.574 --> 10:59.909
I don't know, man.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.744
Oh, fuck, man, we're
really stuck.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.704
- Try to reverse.
- Hold on.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.998
Give it a little more gas.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.084
I am giving it gas! We're
not moving anywhere.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.210
All right, calm down!

11:09.293 --> 11:11.629
Don't get mad at me! It's not my fault!
It's the fucking walls'!

11:11.712 --> 11:12.963
There's fucking cars piling up.

11:13.047 --> 11:13.923
All right, hold on.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.134
Oh, fuck, this is
my worst nightmare, man.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.803
Okay, all right, I'll
climb out of the sunroof.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.513
- I should be able to get out.
- Go get help.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.556
Okay.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.101
Well, you come out, too, man.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.936
- What are you talking about?
- Let's get out of here.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.562
Let's just try to go get help.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.695
All right, climb out, man.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.823
I'm stuck!

11:38.906 --> 11:41.617
- Oh, no.
- What the fuck, man?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.411
Okay, hold on. Let
me get a photo.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.246
Are you fucking kidding me?
Go get help.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.206
It'll be good for your
Tall Boys profile.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.707
Perspective.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.084
Aah!

11:50.167 --> 11:51.919
Oh, that's good.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.546
All right, I'll be right back.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.006
Hurry, Cap, I'm stuck
in two different ways!

12:04.098 --> 12:07.685
All right, so they pulled the car
out, and it's okay to drive.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.312
- Should we head out?
- Yeah, sure.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.649
Do you need a minute? You want to
go grab some food or something?

12:13.732 --> 12:15.109
- Are you a little shaken up?
- No.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.319
Um, to be honest, I'm just
thinking about this wedding, man,

12:17.403 --> 12:19.280
and I got to come clean.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.906
It's not just a
friend's wedding.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.825
It's actually my ex, Ellen's.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.579
Oh, is this, like, a serious ex or
more of a "hi, cutie" type situation?

12:26.662 --> 12:28.622
No, like, serious ex.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.542
Like, 11 years, almost had
kids, the whole thing.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.294
Whoa.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.254
Yeah, and I was looking
at pictures of us online,

12:35.337 --> 12:37.465
and I was like, "Did
I fuck this up?"

12:37.548 --> 12:40.301
Like, we had this
real intense love,

12:40.384 --> 12:42.219
and now she's getting married.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.804
Why'd you guys break up'?

12:43.888 --> 12:47.766
I don't know. After 11 years, you
know, the passion kind of disappears,

12:47.850 --> 12:51.520
and we, like, became more like
roommates and not really lovers,

12:51.604 --> 12:54.648
and at the end, she said I wasn't,
like, her type physically.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.984
Hmm.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.613
Well, um, you guys are both probably
totally different people now, right?

13:00.696 --> 13:03.282
And it was so long ago.
Uh, what is that phrase?

13:03.365 --> 13:05.826
Um, sometimes you meet
people for a reason.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.328
Sometimes you meet
'em for a season.

13:07.411 --> 13:10.206
I like that.
It rhymes.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.294
But how do you know who's for the
season and who's for the reason?

13:15.377 --> 13:17.296
I don't know. I just
know that one rhymed.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.298
That's not very helpful.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.009
But...

13:22.092 --> 13:24.428
You could do me a favor, man, and
come to this wedding with me.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.554
It'll make me feel a lot better.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.224
- Yeah, of course I'll come.
- Oh, thank you so much, man.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.225
Yeah.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.810
Um, also, do you think you
could give me a back rub?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.979
'Cause I have a lot of tension
in the old delts back there

13:34.063 --> 13:35.940
because of the car thing.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.233
I'm not giving you a back rub.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.109
Worth a shot.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.327
- Good breakfast, right?
- Yeah.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.622
- It was a great cappuccino.
- Mm-hmm.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.207
How you feeling?

13:53.290 --> 13:55.292
I'm good, uh, but I
just got to tell you,

13:55.376 --> 13:57.670
I haven't seen Ellen
in many, many years,

13:57.753 --> 13:59.463
and I may freak the fuck out.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.091
So I need you to have
eyes on me at all times.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.552
Don't let me out of your sights.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.844
Okay.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.557
Ciao.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.145
That's good champagne.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.148
DiGiorno.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.282
Dude, that's Ellen.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.828
Stay strong, buddy.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.208
Is that the groom?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.835
Are you fucking kidding me?

14:37.918 --> 14:40.254
He looks exactly like me.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.505
There's definitely a
strong resemblance.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.632
That sneaky, bearded fuck.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.758
Hold me back, Captain.
Hold me back.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.094
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Hold on, you're bigger than me.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.638
- He's stealing Arnie's essence
- Calm down.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.557
I'm gonna go up to Ellen
and tell her I love her,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.183
and we're gonna cancel this
whole fucking wedding.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.685
No. Eat this melon.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.230
Mmm, that is good melon.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.149
All right, stop freaking out.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.234
He's coming over here.
Be cool. You cool?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.653
- You must be Arnold.
- Hello, Bernard.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.907
Um, hi. I'm Dev, a
friend of Arnold's.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.451
It's really beautiful here.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.536
Yeah, it's okay.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.121
I'm glad you guys could make it.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.374
So, looks like you went
with the gray blazer.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.960
A bit pedestrian,
don't you think?

15:20.044 --> 15:24.048
I usually dress with a little more panache
for a special occasion like this.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.760
You look very nice.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.179
Well, good day to you, sir.
Hope you enjoy the event.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.639
Thanks.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.309
Oh, okay.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.729
Uh, nice meeting you.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.856
That tiny little fuck.
I'm gonna kill him.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.691
Melon now!

15:44.652 --> 15:46.654
Oh.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.517
Dude, I had a bunch of melon.
I'm chill.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.560
I'm just gonna go in for
a quick, polite hello.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.229
- No problems.
- All right, okay.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.234
Ciao, Ellen.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.861
Arnold, wow! Oh, my God.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.697
Wow, you look "gorgisimo."

16:29.780 --> 16:31.448
Thank you very much.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.158
Thank you.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.702
So what's going on?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.328
I'm getting married.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.913
Oh, right, of course.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.665
This is my friend Dev.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.834
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.670
- What a beautiful wedding. I--
- So...

16:44.753 --> 16:46.755
I'm not your type physically?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.257
What?

16:48.340 --> 16:52.052
And here we are, you marrying a man
that may as well be my doppelganger.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.054
It's a German word for twin.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.306
Yeah, I do know what
"doppelganger" means.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.267
Congratulations, Ellen!

16:58.350 --> 16:59.643
- Let me give you a hug.
- Hi, Aunt Jeanie.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.562
Excuse me, Aunt Jeanie.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.021
We were talking here.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.064
Arnold.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.399
Ellen, I love you.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.734
Let's get out of here.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.485
Let me take you away forever.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.487
- Take my hand.
- Arnold, um--

17:10.571 --> 17:12.072
Um, why don't you
take my hand, buddy?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.866
He's kidding. Come
on, come on, bud.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.201
Polite hello. You
were doing good, too.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.453
Can I have some more melon?

17:17.536 --> 17:18.954
No. Melon's for good boys.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.251
Dude, I'm sorry for
freaking out out there.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.755
I'll be fine. I just need a
couple minutes just to breathe.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.882
I think we should get
out of here, man.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.675
Let's do something to
take your mind off this.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.885
What do you want to do?

17:34.052 --> 17:36.638
Go to that town, eat that
cheese you were talking about.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.599
That's a good idea.
I'll even drive.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.226
I got a better idea.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.905
Pecorino semi-fresco.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.990
Mmm, Arnie likes.

17:55.073 --> 17:56.784
Spritz?

17:56.867 --> 17:58.202
Cin!

17:58.285 --> 17:59.369
Pasta?

17:59.453 --> 18:00.537
Yes.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.916
Love you, pasta.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.919
Mmm!

18:15.469 --> 18:17.304
Thanks, man. I needed this.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.889
I hear you.

18:18.972 --> 18:22.226
Must be hard seeing someone you
loved for that long get married.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.645
Yeah, and the scary thing
is I'm getting older.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.397
I'm wondering if I'm ever gonna
find that connection again.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.775
Yeah, I think about
that stuff, too,

18:29.858 --> 18:32.611
but I don't think you
wanted to marry Ellen.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.029
Listen to the way you're
talking about it.

18:34.112 --> 18:37.282
You're coming from a place of
fear, not from a place of love.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.034
Yeah, you are right about that,

18:39.117 --> 18:42.246
but there's no denying that
Ellen really shaped me,

18:42.329 --> 18:43.872
who I am today.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.290
What do you mean?

18:45.374 --> 18:48.085
You know, when I was in high school,
I was this skinny, dorky kid.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.545
I was getting no girls.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.130
Then I went to college, and I
started playing in a band.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.423
You know I played bass, right?

18:53.507 --> 18:55.801
Yeah, I've seen those
Throwback Thursday pics.

18:55.884 --> 18:59.096
So one day I did this big show with
my band, Cheesesteak Armageddon.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.890
I met Ellen backstage, I
took her out on a date,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.976
and she totally
changed everything.

19:04.059 --> 19:07.563
She, like, introduced me to
art and food and wine and...

19:07.646 --> 19:09.523
S-she got me into artichokes.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.819
That was a long time ago.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.363
The Arnold I know is not
a relationship guy.

19:16.446 --> 19:19.032
Remember how much fun you were having
bopping out those "hi, cuties."

19:19.116 --> 19:21.159
Yeah, "hi, cuties" are
fun, but they're stupid.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.580
Yeah, but...

19:24.663 --> 19:27.916
you did seem to be genuinely
enjoying those adventures.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.377
Remember the tire swing?
Remember feeding that duck?

19:30.460 --> 19:33.380
That duck was cute.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.050
I don't think you're
ready to settle down.

19:37.134 --> 19:40.178
Have fun being single.
You'll meet someone...

19:40.262 --> 19:41.805
I hope.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.849
I hope I do, too.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.436
Damn, this is beautiful.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.150
- Hey, can you take a pic of me?
- Sure.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.032
I love this pose.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.491
There you go. Pretty good.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.286
Oh-oh-oh! That's a great one.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.289
What are you doing?

20:07.372 --> 20:11.084
I'm sending this pic to duck girl.
What do you think?

20:11.168 --> 20:13.086
"Guess who's
thinking about you."

20:14.296 --> 20:15.213
Ooh, ooh.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.090
She's writing back.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.384
"Miss you, big boy.
When you coming home?"

20:19.468 --> 20:21.637
I'm back, man.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.640
All right, should we go
back to this wedding?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.683
Yeah, that's probably
the right thing to do.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.143
Let's do it.

20:30.520 --> 20:35.233
I am simply overjoyed that
Ellen will have Bernard by her side

20:35.317 --> 20:37.819
- to share sunsets...
- Fuck.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.322
- You think we missed the food'?
- Yeah, and the ceremony.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.823
...for the rest of their years.

20:41.907 --> 20:46.870
And so to quote Albus Dumbledore from
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,

20:46.954 --> 20:49.748
"We are only as strong
as we are united,

20:49.831 --> 20:52.417
as weak as we are divided."

20:52.501 --> 20:55.629
Congratulations, Mr.
and Mrs. Bialik.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.464
- Bravo.
- I'm gonna go say something.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.883
- Wait. No.
- I know what I'm doing. I'll be fine.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.428
Excuse me, excuse me.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.264
Hi, I'd like to make a toast, please.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.558
Uh, my name is
Arnold Baumheiser.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.395
I'm a long-term
ex-boyfriend of the bride.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.774
I'm serious. Stop laughing.

21:17.859 --> 21:21.905
Ellen, I came here today
to object to this union.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.700
In fact, earlier today I
told you I loved you,

21:24.783 --> 21:27.703
and I'm pretty sure
you weren't into it.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.956
But after some
unpasteurized cheese

21:31.039 --> 21:34.209
and some sage advice from
my little bud over there,

21:34.292 --> 21:36.378
I know I was misguided.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.548
Ellen, I do love you,
but not in that way.

21:39.631 --> 21:43.260
We're just not going down that same
path of life together anymore.

21:43.343 --> 21:46.054
You're on your path,
and I'm on mine.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.932
And I hope your path is filled
with happiness and fulfillment.

21:50.308 --> 21:53.020
Bernard, you may be
a smaller Arnold

21:53.103 --> 21:55.772
and some might even
say a fake Arnold,

21:55.856 --> 21:58.650
but if Ellen loves you, you
must have a huge heart.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.862
So I love you both. Cheers
to the bride and groom.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.530
Bravo.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.407
Cheers.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.645
Dude, are you seeing this?

22:35.729 --> 22:39.441
I'm dancing with the most beautiful
girl, and she lives in New York, buddy.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.110

What about you?

You bopping off any of those
"hi, cutie" GIFs or what?

22:48.742 --> 22:51.244
I don't even have
anyone to send it to.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.872
That's a bummer, man.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.083
But you know the thing
about love is that it's--

22:56.166 --> 22:58.668
Hey everybody! It's raining!

22:58.752 --> 23:00.796
Let's jump in the pool!

23:00.879 --> 23:02.464
Cap, we got to jump in.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.882
Yeah!

23:05.801 --> 23:07.010
No, I'm not getting in the pool.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.428
It's Captain's orders.

23:08.512 --> 23:12.724
Take off that fancy jacket, pop those
loafers, and we're taking a dip.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.061
- All right.
- Yes.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.542
- I'm leaving you.
- I know.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.335
Did you ever think you'd spend
so much time making pasta

24:22.419 --> 24:23.628
with an Indian man?

24:23.712 --> 24:25.380
What will you do in New York?

24:25.463 --> 24:26.840
I don't know.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.300
It's been really
great working here.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.801
Very inspirational.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.179
Seeing you guys doing something
you're passionate about,

24:32.262 --> 24:33.305
working with your hands,

24:33.388 --> 24:36.183
putting your heart and
soul into the pasta.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.144
Maybe I'll keep practicing, open
up my own pasta shop in New York.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.395
Oh, yeah, maybe.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.938
Yeah, you can come
visit and work for me.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.356
Why should I work for you?

24:43.440 --> 24:44.774
I mean, I'm better than you.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.360
I can come and open my
own "competiting" shop.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.695
Your own "competiting" shop?

24:48.778 --> 24:49.654
Maybe people will come to mine

24:49.738 --> 24:51.489
when they want someone that
can speak proper English.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.657
It's "competing."

24:52.741 --> 24:55.410
Okay, whatever, competing.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.204
Give me a hug.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.914
Certo.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.498
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.626
Keep practicing your English.
It's very bad.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.710
Thank you.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.136
Shannon.

25:13.220 --> 25:17.140
It's your favorite and
only Indian client Dev.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.308
What's up?

25:18.391 --> 25:21.770
So you're back in New York, huh?
Mr. Chef Boyardee.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.356
I've gotten your emails.
Please stop calling me that.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.941
Okay, well, look,
you here to work,

25:26.024 --> 25:27.525
or are you still
making SpaghettiOs?

25:27.609 --> 25:30.362
Um, honestly, I-I
don't know what I'm doing.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.405
You know, I-I just
got back last week.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.909
Well, I got an audition for you,
and it's pretty interesting

25:35.992 --> 25:38.745
It's food-related, and I
know you like that shit.

25:38.828 --> 25:39.746
I do like food.

25:39.829 --> 25:42.123
The best part is
that it's easy, Dev,

25:42.207 --> 25:44.292
and it pays that good money!

25:44.376 --> 25:45.627
What is it?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.928
In just a few moments, two
of the country's top bakers

25:55.011 --> 25:57.138
will face off in the
ultimate batter battle.

25:57.222 --> 26:01.268
They'll be judged on taste,
originality, and presentation.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.186
What'll be our judges'
cupcake conclusion?

26:03.270 --> 26:05.188
I'm your host, Dev Shah.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.566
This is Clash of the Cupcakes.
