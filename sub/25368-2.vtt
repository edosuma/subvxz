00:00.040 --> 00:01.972
<i>- Previously
on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:01.998 --> 00:02.941
<i>- You're not gonna shoot me.</i>

00:04.610 --> 00:05.910
<i>- I shot an innocent man</i>

00:06.665 --> 00:08.566
<i>because I can't stop seeing Stahl.</i>

00:08.881 --> 00:11.424
- Five victims.
They're all dead.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.695
- Parker?
- You knew him?

00:13.720 --> 00:14.873
- He's my partner.

00:14.908 --> 00:16.579
NYPD Intelligence Unit.

00:16.613 --> 00:18.691
- I think you knew
your partner was in danger.

00:18.725 --> 00:20.226
Do you know who would want to kill him?

00:20.226 --> 00:22.360
<i>- Parker was meeting
a dock worker named Orlando,</i>

00:22.394 --> 00:24.329
<i>only Orlando was too scared to show.</i>

00:24.363 --> 00:25.763
<i>- What was Orlando
so afraid of?</i>

00:25.798 --> 00:27.899
- Hello, Matt.
I need a little favor.

00:27.933 --> 00:28.900
Happy to repay it.

00:28.934 --> 00:30.468
<i>- Ramsey has Quince.</i>

00:30.493 --> 00:31.604
<i>- How did Intel know
where to find Quince?</i>

00:31.628 --> 00:32.908
<i>- 'Cause they have reach,
Harlee.</i>

00:32.933 --> 00:34.331
- And you want to deliver
Orlando to them?

00:34.356 --> 00:36.174
- No, I want you to.

00:36.208 --> 00:37.775
<i>- They killed one
of their own men.</i>

00:37.810 --> 00:39.611
<i>I'm not gonna deliver a man to his death.</i>

00:39.645 --> 00:41.212
<i>- You have to do it.</i>

00:41.237 --> 00:43.372
<i>I'm not starting a war
with the secret police.</i>

00:44.550 --> 00:47.852
<i>I want things back to the way they were.</i>

00:47.887 --> 00:49.621
- And I don't.

00:49.655 --> 00:51.356
I'll stand alone.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.490
<i>- Seriously, I like it.</i>

00:52.525 --> 00:54.893
<i>It's nice to see you happy for a change.</i>

00:57.897 --> 00:58.897
- No!

00:58.931 --> 01:00.532
No, no!

01:00.566 --> 01:02.874
Ah, no...

01:22.588 --> 01:23.888
- Come on.

01:25.925 --> 01:26.891
- Come on.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.643
- Harlee.

01:45.678 --> 01:47.912
I know there isn't anything
that I could say

01:47.947 --> 01:49.414
that'll...
- So don't try.

01:51.684 --> 01:54.619
- I'm gonna find
whoever did this.

01:56.956 --> 01:59.311
- We already know
who did this.

02:00.492 --> 02:02.093
Me.

02:02.127 --> 02:03.428
Okay? I killed him.

02:03.462 --> 02:04.429
- Harlee, no...

02:04.463 --> 02:05.609
- Don't!

02:08.067 --> 02:11.031
- Just let me feel it!

02:11.737 --> 02:15.202
I want to remember
exactly how this feels.

02:15.554 --> 02:17.989
- Trust me, you don't forget.

02:18.014 --> 02:19.915
- Harlee, you don't
got to be strong.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.740
We got that part covered.

02:21.914 --> 02:23.481
- I should've been there.

02:23.515 --> 02:25.016
- Then it'd be you
under the sheet.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.951
- I mean... I mean,
I could've stopped it.

02:26.986 --> 02:28.882
- Harlee, this wasn't
your fault.

02:29.688 --> 02:31.456
- Harlee, you can't
take this on!

02:31.490 --> 02:32.857
- Intelligence already did.

02:32.891 --> 02:33.891
- Look at me.
Look at me.

02:33.926 --> 02:35.460
I'm gonna handle this.

02:35.494 --> 02:36.995
Whatever it takes,

02:37.029 --> 02:38.963
I'm gonna make this right.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.967
- Nothing will ever
make this right.

02:45.241 --> 02:48.076
Anything on the first sweep?
- Nothing that stands out.

02:48.111 --> 02:49.621
We're still processing
the vehicle for prints.

02:49.645 --> 02:51.623
- Hey, unless you want to be
cleaning carpet stains

02:51.647 --> 02:53.281
for the rest of your career,

02:53.316 --> 02:55.217
the results come to me first.

02:55.251 --> 02:56.618
You got it?
- Yeah.

02:56.652 --> 02:58.086
- Me.

03:02.692 --> 03:04.226
- What would you do, Woz?

03:07.530 --> 03:09.097
Would you stand down?

03:14.804 --> 03:17.139
- They took him from me.

03:17.807 --> 03:20.242
- And I can't let them
take you too.

03:20.276 --> 03:21.810
Go home.

03:21.844 --> 03:23.311
Cristina's gonna be worried.

03:23.346 --> 03:24.513
- I could take care of her.

03:24.547 --> 03:26.648
- No.
I need to tell her.

03:32.555 --> 03:34.156
And then I need to call Gail Baker.

03:34.190 --> 03:36.458
- What? Why do you want
to involve FBI?

03:36.492 --> 03:37.859
- Because I saw Stahl.

03:37.894 --> 03:39.327
- Harlee...

03:41.664 --> 03:43.665
We're not gonna let you stand alone.

03:43.699 --> 03:45.709
- Yeah, I'll drive you.

03:46.536 --> 03:47.702
- No, I think I want to walk.

05:02.378 --> 05:04.846
- It's about time.
Shouldn't it be the teenager

05:04.881 --> 05:07.849
stumbling in so late that it's early?

05:11.387 --> 05:12.621
- Cristina.

05:12.655 --> 05:13.622
- It's okay.
I'm cool with

05:13.656 --> 05:14.896
playing responsible for the day.

05:14.924 --> 05:16.224
Maybe tomorrow, we can return to

05:16.259 --> 05:18.226
regularly scheduled programming?

05:21.764 --> 05:22.908
It's my way of asking if I can go out

05:22.932 --> 05:23.965
with Michaela tonight,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.234
but at least I'm asking with juice.

05:29.605 --> 05:31.273
Mom, what is it?

05:35.578 --> 05:37.821
- Baby, something terrible's
happened.

05:39.282 --> 05:40.532
- What is it?

05:47.757 --> 05:49.458
Nava's dead.

05:50.593 --> 05:52.000
He's gone.

05:59.702 --> 06:01.770
- Looks like the party
waited for us.

06:01.804 --> 06:05.273
- I told them to.
This guy's ours.

06:06.342 --> 06:07.943
- So he traveled
all the way from here

06:07.977 --> 06:10.645
to Nava's place just to mug somebody?

06:10.680 --> 06:11.813
That feel right to you?

06:11.847 --> 06:13.515
- His fingerprints
were at the scene.

06:13.549 --> 06:14.916
That's the only story I need.

06:14.951 --> 06:17.452
NYPD! Show me your hands!

06:17.486 --> 06:19.421
- I get surprised,
you get shot!

06:21.524 --> 06:23.592
- Cesar, you here?

06:23.626 --> 06:25.226
- Clear.
- Clear.

06:33.002 --> 06:35.103
- Surprise.

06:35.137 --> 06:37.255
- Get me an ambulance
out here.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.675
- Forget the pretense.
Call the coroner.

06:40.710 --> 06:43.511
- This is Nava's killer?
I don't get it.

06:43.546 --> 06:44.790
- Hey, Lieutenant Wozniak
in here?

06:44.814 --> 06:45.780
- Five years for assault,

06:45.815 --> 06:47.782
the first thing this guy does
when he gets out

06:47.817 --> 06:50.352
is kill the ADA that put him
away, then hangs himself?

06:51.554 --> 06:52.954
- Bad morning all around.

06:52.989 --> 06:54.723
This guy killed Nava?

06:54.757 --> 06:57.125
- His prints were all over
Nava's car.

06:57.159 --> 07:00.616
Didn't exactly place himself
on the Mount Rushmore of crime.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.395
- Check this out.

07:02.429 --> 07:04.235
Looks like defensive wounds.

07:04.269 --> 07:06.001
And that bruising right there?

07:06.035 --> 07:08.803
Definitely didn't come from that belt.

07:08.838 --> 07:11.448
- Well, maybe he struggled
when he was hanging there.

07:11.449 --> 07:13.284
- Guess suicide
wasn't his forte either.

07:13.318 --> 07:15.886
- If it was suicide at all.

07:15.921 --> 07:17.087
- "Yes, Lieutenant.

07:17.122 --> 07:18.889
"I'll go round up the neighbors

07:18.924 --> 07:20.691
"and take some statements,
'cause I'm a cop,

07:20.725 --> 07:22.193
"and that's what I do for a living.

07:22.227 --> 07:23.360
That's how I get paid."

07:23.395 --> 07:24.929
Come on!

07:27.432 --> 07:30.433
This isn't gonna be a popular call,

07:31.393 --> 07:33.728
but we're not gonna ask any questions.

07:34.306 --> 07:37.608
- Boss.
This isn't some random case.

07:37.642 --> 07:38.943
If someone killed this guy...

07:38.977 --> 07:40.311
- For now,

07:40.345 --> 07:42.546
they get away with it.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.983
As far as anybody
on the outside is concerned,

07:46.017 --> 07:48.052
Stretch was a troubled ex-con

07:48.086 --> 07:49.086
who couldn't deal.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.955
- That's not gonna be
good enough for Harlee.

07:50.989 --> 07:53.390
- Harlee's not gonna know.

07:53.425 --> 07:56.293
If she thinks there's a thread
that leads to Intelligence,

07:56.328 --> 07:58.262
she's gonna go right after Ramsey.

07:58.296 --> 08:00.064
- She won't be going alone.

08:00.098 --> 08:02.466
- She can go
with God's own thunder.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.068
It's not gonna matter.

08:04.102 --> 08:06.070
- The Intelligence Unit
is untouchable. I get it.

08:06.104 --> 08:08.606
Cloaked in blue,
beyond the chain of command.

08:08.972 --> 08:11.308
But do we have to help them
cover up a murder?

08:12.143 --> 08:14.678
- To keep Harlee safe,

08:15.112 --> 08:16.345
yes.

08:18.603 --> 08:20.157
- Detective Santos,
Director Baker

08:20.182 --> 08:21.197
is clearing time for you.

08:21.222 --> 08:22.286
If you'll just have a seat...

08:22.311 --> 08:24.083
- Granting oversight
is not a license to mismanage,

08:24.108 --> 08:25.008
even for y...

08:25.042 --> 08:26.698
- I saw him.

08:27.511 --> 08:29.823
- You know the FBI doesn't have
an open-door policy, right?

08:29.847 --> 08:31.514
- Apparently,
you don't have a policy

08:31.548 --> 08:33.049
on catching rogue agents either.

08:33.082 --> 08:35.385
- You saw Stahl.
- On the J train to Manhattan.

08:35.419 --> 08:36.919
He's in New York.

08:36.953 --> 08:38.520
- Look, Harlee.

08:38.554 --> 08:39.989
If we had anything new on Stahl,

08:40.024 --> 08:41.524
anything to put him in the area,

08:41.558 --> 08:43.558
you would be the first to hear about it.

08:43.594 --> 08:46.205
- I know what I saw.

08:46.239 --> 08:47.530
He's back.

08:47.564 --> 08:49.637
- At this point, I doubt
he could afford a bus ticket.

08:50.601 --> 08:51.734
- That's not gonna stop him.

08:51.769 --> 08:53.208
- There's been no indication

08:53.243 --> 08:54.457
that Robert Stahl
has come back to New York.

08:54.481 --> 08:56.406
No contact with any known associates,

08:56.440 --> 08:57.740
no attempt to see his son.

08:57.775 --> 09:00.276
- He's not gonna telegraph
his intentions.

09:00.311 --> 09:01.744
- Even an obsessive
can move on

09:01.779 --> 09:03.680
when his primary fantasy has been broken.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.448
I believe his
was shattered beyond repair.

09:05.482 --> 09:06.716
- I'm sorry, who are you?

09:06.750 --> 09:08.618
- Special Agent Katie Myers,
Phoenix office.

09:08.652 --> 09:10.720
- Agent Myers has been
tracking Stahl

09:10.754 --> 09:12.055
for four months in Arizona.

09:12.089 --> 09:13.589
- Stahl's clever,
but so are we.

09:13.624 --> 09:16.326
Even former FBI agents
run out of resources.

09:18.062 --> 09:19.762
We burned three different aliases.

09:19.797 --> 09:21.597
Two in Phoenix, one outside of Yuma.

09:21.632 --> 09:23.032
Last contact was on State Route 19,

09:23.067 --> 09:24.600
just north of the Mexican border.

09:24.635 --> 09:26.703
- And that's where you think
he is, Mexico?

09:26.737 --> 09:28.871
- As far as we know, yes.

09:28.906 --> 09:32.542
- I saw him last night!
I'm not crazy!

09:32.576 --> 09:34.321
- I know what it's like
to be a victim, Detective.

09:34.345 --> 09:35.778
How it plays with your mind.

09:35.813 --> 09:37.894
It's not fair for anyone
to have that power.

09:38.615 --> 09:40.717
Believe me, I want to find Robert Stahl

09:40.751 --> 09:42.385
just as much as you do.

09:42.419 --> 09:44.275
- Then you have a lot to prove.

09:53.797 --> 09:56.599
- Ugh, is this guy
gonna show or what?

09:57.968 --> 10:00.470
What do you think? Five more minutes?

10:01.839 --> 10:03.973
Yo, Tufo.

10:04.007 --> 10:05.742
- What?

10:05.776 --> 10:08.275
- I know it's a rough day,
but I need you to be focused.

10:08.276 --> 10:09.353
- Just doesn't feel like
the time

10:09.377 --> 10:10.511
to be running protection,

10:10.545 --> 10:12.579
especially with Woz back to work.

10:12.614 --> 10:13.580
You talk to Harlee?

10:13.615 --> 10:14.781
- I stopped by her house.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.599
She wasn't home.

10:17.318 --> 10:18.585
She knows we have her back.

10:26.628 --> 10:28.629
Oh, damn. This just got more fun.

10:28.663 --> 10:29.630
- Not for him.

10:29.664 --> 10:31.565
- NYPD! Hands on your head!

10:31.599 --> 10:32.610
- Oh, no,
you guys got me.

10:32.634 --> 10:33.767
- Shut up.

10:33.801 --> 10:34.801
- Yo, what the...

10:34.836 --> 10:36.954
- Ooh.
- Ladies.

10:41.342 --> 10:42.576
Man, I should get a discount

10:42.610 --> 10:43.888
for this kind of abuse, you know?

10:43.912 --> 10:45.312
- Well, we had an audience.

10:45.346 --> 10:47.447
We had to sell it.

10:47.482 --> 10:48.715
- Ah-ah-ah.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.284
Keep it shut.

10:50.318 --> 10:52.386
I do not want to know
what you're transporting.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.887
- All right.

10:56.324 --> 10:57.835
You know, I never thought
that I'd feel so safe,

10:57.859 --> 10:59.693
riding with cops.

11:01.496 --> 11:03.597
Hey, listen, uh...

11:03.631 --> 11:05.465
I got some friends, right?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.467
And I know that they would pay top dollar

11:07.502 --> 11:08.835
to ride with New York's finest.

11:08.870 --> 11:11.572
- Oh, you got some friends?
Who?

11:11.606 --> 11:13.473
- Uh, it's this fence, right?

11:13.508 --> 11:15.242
And I mean, he moves,
like, a lot of cash.

11:15.276 --> 11:17.945
- Sorry.
Referrals not accepted.

11:17.979 --> 11:21.248
- Right.
We only work with scum we know.

11:21.282 --> 11:22.826
- I'm just trying to contribute
to y'all's retirement fund.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.484
- Oh, yeah?

11:24.519 --> 11:25.563
Because if we hear any talk
on the streets

11:25.587 --> 11:28.589
about this arrangement,
your next ride is free.

11:29.390 --> 11:31.258
And one-way.

11:33.528 --> 11:34.605
- You think he was strangled?

11:34.629 --> 11:37.664
- Windpipe looked crushed.
A belt doesn't do that.

11:37.699 --> 11:39.433
- And Harlee
doesn't know anything?

11:39.467 --> 11:40.467
- For her own good. Why?

11:40.501 --> 11:42.346
- She sure looks like
someone who knows something.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.671
I'm just gonna...
- Why wasn't I told?

11:44.706 --> 11:46.840
Espada, why wasn't I
brought into the scene?

11:46.874 --> 11:49.209
- There wasn't much
to be done there.

11:49.244 --> 11:50.644
- Really?

11:50.678 --> 11:52.512
- Look, I swear to God,
it wasn't my call.

11:52.547 --> 11:53.480
- Which part?

11:53.514 --> 11:55.649
The part where you
skipped me on the forensics

11:55.683 --> 11:56.794
or where you ID'd the killer,

11:56.818 --> 11:57.962
found the body, processed the scene,

11:57.986 --> 12:00.354
and neglected to tell me any of it?

12:00.388 --> 12:02.956
- Woz thought the case
was too close to home.

12:03.524 --> 12:04.832
He's not wrong.

12:05.393 --> 12:07.661
- You don't get to make
that call.

12:07.695 --> 12:09.830
And neither does Woz.

12:09.864 --> 12:10.931
- Harlee.

12:16.337 --> 12:17.671
Cesar Molina.

12:17.705 --> 12:19.339
His prints were all over Nava's car.

12:19.374 --> 12:21.308
Nava put him away
five years ago for assault.

12:21.342 --> 12:23.710
He was released two weeks ago.

12:23.745 --> 12:25.412
- Revenge killing?

12:25.446 --> 12:27.314
- We think so, yeah.

12:27.348 --> 12:29.516
- Then why off himself
right after?

12:29.550 --> 12:31.318
- Maybe he don't want
to go back in.

12:31.352 --> 12:33.553
- Just happened to put
his prints all over the car?

12:34.589 --> 12:35.989
I didn't say he was smart.

12:38.293 --> 12:39.426
- No sign of foul play?

12:39.460 --> 12:40.861
- No, nothing.

12:43.598 --> 12:45.899
- This is why you lose
at poker.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.078
- Harlee, you want to see him?
I'll take you to the morgue.

12:48.102 --> 12:49.580
They're gonna give you the same answers.

12:49.604 --> 12:51.538
- You're not giving me answers!

12:51.572 --> 12:53.006
Loman, let's go.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.741
- Uh, go where?

12:54.776 --> 12:55.853
- Like you didn't hear
everything?

12:55.877 --> 12:57.744
You got more tells than Espada.

12:59.554 --> 13:02.015
- You made a mistake
last night.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.685
- If I made it,
it wasn't a mistake.

13:04.719 --> 13:07.321
- I would have delivered
your witness myself.

13:09.390 --> 13:11.892
We were playing so nice,

13:11.926 --> 13:14.761
till your girl drove off
with my end of the deal.

13:14.796 --> 13:16.963
I only play nice once.

13:17.447 --> 13:19.824
- A good man got killed.

13:20.635 --> 13:23.770
- Then I sincerely hope
she learns from the experience.

13:23.805 --> 13:24.971
Cause and effect.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.707
- I got the guy that did it.

13:28.743 --> 13:30.043
He was hanging at his house,

13:30.078 --> 13:32.378
an apparent suicide.

13:33.414 --> 13:35.982
Unless you look closer.

13:36.017 --> 13:37.484
- And if you decide not to?

13:37.518 --> 13:41.088
- Then I'd expect a guarantee
of Harlee's safety.

13:41.122 --> 13:43.357
- She could've guaranteed that
herself.

13:45.927 --> 13:47.828
- One thing
I learned overseas...

13:47.862 --> 13:51.331
it's the loose ends
that can come back to bite you.

13:51.366 --> 13:54.935
You're moving so fast,
you can't catch all of yours.

13:56.437 --> 13:57.981
- I'd make sure
I could control my own crew

13:58.005 --> 13:59.940
before I made promises, Lieutenant.

14:01.843 --> 14:03.343
- I still want Quince.

14:03.378 --> 14:05.746
- I'm afraid that deal
has expired.

14:05.780 --> 14:08.515
- Oh, your witness is dead.
It costs you nothing.

14:08.549 --> 14:10.517
Quince had me shot.

14:10.551 --> 14:13.453
Consider it a gesture of good faith.

14:13.488 --> 14:15.956
- You want to know
what I learned overseas?

14:15.990 --> 14:18.091
You make your own advantage.

14:18.126 --> 14:21.495
If I have food, I make sure
everyone's starving.

14:21.529 --> 14:23.663
If I have the high ground,

14:23.698 --> 14:25.264
I wait.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.101
And if I have one bullet left
and the enemy is closing in...

14:28.136 --> 14:30.520
- I control my fate.

14:34.809 --> 14:37.235
- Your dealer stays
where he is.

14:38.479 --> 14:40.147
But I'm impressed that you found me.

14:53.895 --> 14:55.996
- Cesar Molina's
being prepped for autopsy.

14:56.030 --> 14:57.998
I'm afraid we can't show you the body.

14:58.032 --> 15:00.467
- Well, I need the report
as soon as you get it.

15:00.501 --> 15:01.545
- I'll have it sent
to the precinct.

15:01.569 --> 15:03.470
- Just call me directly.

15:03.504 --> 15:04.871
- Will do.

15:04.906 --> 15:06.673
- Wait.

15:08.743 --> 15:11.211
I need to see another case.

16:43.804 --> 16:44.948
- What does he keep
in his safe?

16:44.972 --> 16:46.973
- Case files, as far as I know.

16:47.008 --> 16:48.819
He must have been rushed,
or he would have said more.

16:48.843 --> 16:49.953
- Explains why the phone
was smashed.

16:49.977 --> 16:52.017
He was probably trying
to use it when they attacked.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.854
- Try again.
The text said 1-2-4...

17:00.888 --> 17:02.656
- I know the numbers.

17:13.034 --> 17:14.724
- Harlee...

17:16.483 --> 17:18.151
- I'm fine.

17:18.339 --> 17:19.806
- Yeah?

17:19.839 --> 17:20.874
- I'm fine.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.576
- It's okay.
We'll figure it out.

17:28.316 --> 17:30.183
- The safe was
a shot in the dark.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.814
Those numbers could mean anything.

17:31.848 --> 17:33.744
Can you just give me a minute?

17:34.188 --> 17:35.555
I'll meet you down in the car.

17:35.590 --> 17:37.123
- Sure.

17:58.079 --> 17:59.713
- You know what I was
thinking?

17:59.747 --> 18:01.158
This would be a great day
to be a criminal.

18:01.182 --> 18:03.183
All the supervision in one place.

18:03.217 --> 18:04.851
- Thinking of running
a stop sign?

18:04.885 --> 18:06.219
- Or robbing a bank.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.222
Moving somewhere sandy, just you, me,

18:09.256 --> 18:11.091
the ukulele I'd learn to play.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.126
All the time in the world.

18:45.399 --> 18:47.599
- Your friend didn't tell me
it would be two stops.

18:47.624 --> 18:48.933
- Pssh. What do you care?

18:48.968 --> 18:50.809
We're paying you twice your rate.

18:50.810 --> 18:51.976
- Keep with the attitude,

18:52.011 --> 18:53.321
you'll be walking to your next stop.

18:53.345 --> 18:55.847
- Aw. There goes
your five-star rating.

18:55.881 --> 18:57.348
Keep it running.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.034
Oh, man.

19:16.068 --> 19:17.302
Ugh!

19:22.742 --> 19:23.742
- Easy.

19:23.776 --> 19:24.986
We just want the other bag of cash.

19:25.010 --> 19:26.478
- I'm not a big sharer.

19:27.847 --> 19:29.848
- How long has this
been going on?

19:29.882 --> 19:32.050
- Since the demotion.

19:32.084 --> 19:33.718
I needed cash, Woz.

19:33.753 --> 19:35.320
New York is still New York.

19:35.354 --> 19:36.431
- You should've come to me.

19:36.455 --> 19:38.323
- What, after you got shot?

19:38.357 --> 19:39.446
I-I didn't think you needed

19:39.480 --> 19:41.659
another "woe is me" speech from me.

19:41.694 --> 19:42.771
- And what the hell
were you doing?

19:42.795 --> 19:44.183
- I recused myself.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.417
- Ah, noble.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.519
What were you carrying?

19:46.553 --> 19:48.153
- I don't even know.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.299
Uh, they must have been
fencing something high-dollar,

19:50.323 --> 19:51.824
'cause the runner had a lot of cash.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.359
- This is why
we don't provide cover

19:53.393 --> 19:55.261
or hold product for anyone.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.328
- It wasn't drugs.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.329
We said no to drugs.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.098
- The streets don't care.

19:59.132 --> 20:00.766
You had their cash and you lost it.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.434
Now we're all on the hook for it.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.537
- Yeah, but to who?
- I don't know.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.339
- Well, I bet you
they know who you are.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.441
- I might have a way
to find out.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.511
- Then find out.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.713
It's time we got back on offense.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.226
- Hard to believe.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.462
I was the first one
to even turn this thing on.

20:30.879 --> 20:32.665
- There's a protocol
with evidence.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.467
I-I'm guessing you skipped a few steps.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.170
- Yeah, I had to.
You gave up looking!

20:38.204 --> 20:40.205
- Because we found the guy
that did it!

20:40.240 --> 20:42.241
- Oh, that's right.
Convenient suicide.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.343
All wrapped up in a bow.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.579
Question is,
who are you gift-wrapping for?

20:46.613 --> 20:49.315
- Harlee,
this has got to stop.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.349
- No!

20:50.383 --> 20:52.384
Not when every instinct in me says

20:52.419 --> 20:53.586
that Ramsey's behind this.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.656
- These instincts haven't been
doing you any favors lately.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.358
- Well, thanks for the vote
of confidence.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.861
- Harlee,
sit down, please.

21:05.899 --> 21:07.666
I want to protect you.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.235
- What, you think
it was a coincidence

21:10.270 --> 21:13.272
that hours after Intelligence
loses Orlando,

21:13.306 --> 21:14.907
he winds up collateral damage

21:14.941 --> 21:16.909
in an unrelated attack on Nava?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.577
- Listen to me.

21:18.612 --> 21:21.614
You killed a man,
thinking that it was Stahl.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.450
You're seeing things
that aren't there, Harlee.

21:24.484 --> 21:28.354
Part of you is still trapped
in that cabin.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.755
It's clouding your judgment,

21:29.789 --> 21:32.257
and I need you to trust mine.

21:43.637 --> 21:45.137
- It was a mistake.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.038
He wasn't supposed to be part of it.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.452
- How would you know that
unless you were there?

21:49.476 --> 21:50.553
- I wasn't.
I wasn't, I swear!

21:50.577 --> 21:52.878
- Who killed Nava?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.446
- I can only tell you
who ordered it,

21:54.481 --> 21:55.581
and he tends to outsource.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.715
- But you knew.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.450
You knew and you didn't stop it.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.285
- I found out after.
I wasn't involved.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.286
Why would I be here if I was?

22:01.321 --> 22:02.506
- I don't know.

22:02.540 --> 22:03.889
Death wish?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.491
- I'm trying to help you.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.849
- Help me?

22:07.494 --> 22:09.628
A huge part of my life

22:09.663 --> 22:11.430
died on that sidewalk last night,

22:11.464 --> 22:12.965
and you let that happen!

22:12.999 --> 22:15.801
My whole crew thinks I'm crazy.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.604
I think I was better off
before you started helping me.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.650
- Before this is over,
my help might save your life.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.909
- Don't you dare play savior.
If it weren't for...

22:23.943 --> 22:25.310
- For what?

22:25.345 --> 22:27.680
Your own choice to turn that car around?

22:27.714 --> 22:29.458
The dumb luck that you
showed up at the Sunrise

22:29.482 --> 22:30.832
when you did?

22:32.552 --> 22:35.287
You're not crazy. It's all connected.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.340
This is what I know.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.827
Ramsey was working with two longshoremen,

22:41.861 --> 22:42.728
Orlando and Morris,

22:42.762 --> 22:44.663
to smuggle illegal cargo
through the docks.

22:44.698 --> 22:46.532
You took out Morris at the Sunrise,

22:46.566 --> 22:48.333
so Ramsey needed Orlando.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.234
- Why?

22:49.269 --> 22:50.546
- Because they were trying
to give evidence

22:50.570 --> 22:51.704
to Internal Affairs.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.018
A shipping container that arrived

22:53.043 --> 22:54.351
the day of the Sunrise...
I think my partner had them

22:54.376 --> 22:56.691
hide it at the yard
and change the ID number.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.621
- But if Orlando
had the number,

22:58.645 --> 23:00.445
then why did Ramsey have him killed?

23:02.248 --> 23:03.698
- 'Cause it went bad.

23:04.317 --> 23:05.908
Your friend...

23:06.653 --> 23:08.620
he got in the way.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.322
Tried to protect Orlando.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.032
- What was in the container?

23:20.066 --> 23:22.550
- I don't know.
Ramsey wasn't sharing.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.504
- Why risk trusting me?

23:25.538 --> 23:27.972
- 'Cause I couldn't save
my partner.

23:28.942 --> 23:29.908
Thought you might be able to help

23:29.943 --> 23:31.677
expose what he died for.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.747
<i>- You want something from me,</i>

23:34.781 --> 23:36.582
you and I need to come
to an understanding.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.751
- The understanding
is simple, Captain.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.386
I do my job, you take the credit.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.032
- Tempting, but I haven't
risen to this position

23:43.056 --> 23:44.823
by fronting vigilantism.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.658
- Hard work and competency,
no doubt.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.661
- Or tripping over the NYPD's
most powerful entity.

23:49.696 --> 23:52.898
- All our crew wants is
our little corner of Brooklyn.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.799
- That'd be a start.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.502
- Then I need
Detectives Tufo and Nazario

23:56.536 --> 23:59.602
off patrol and back
on my team immediately.

23:59.636 --> 24:01.573
- After their
disciplinary probation,

24:01.608 --> 24:02.708
I'll review their appeal.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.343
- Assurances were made.

24:04.377 --> 24:05.387
- You're not hearing me,
Lieutenant.

24:05.411 --> 24:08.380
Captain McManus
no longer leads this precinct.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.381
I do.

24:09.415 --> 24:10.549
You agree to run anti-crime

24:10.583 --> 24:12.518
with a modicum of accountability,

24:12.552 --> 24:14.419
I'll be your biggest champion,

24:14.454 --> 24:15.731
but your days of running roughshod

24:15.755 --> 24:17.471
through this community are over.

24:17.506 --> 24:20.425
- I built this unit
from the ground up

24:20.460 --> 24:21.693
20 years ago.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.962
You guys come and go so often,

24:23.997 --> 24:26.465
I confuse you with the furniture.

24:26.499 --> 24:29.034
But the unit always stands,
and you know why?

24:29.068 --> 24:30.402
- Your people skills?

24:30.436 --> 24:31.737
- Commitment.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.739
Commitment and results.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.774
- Results are a team effort,

24:35.809 --> 24:38.110
a team assigned by this desk.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.912
Anything else, Lieutenant?

24:48.421 --> 24:50.065
- Yo, you actually look like
you know what you doing.

24:50.089 --> 24:53.058
- Little brother, all growed up
in his patrol blues.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.495
There somewhere we can talk?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.932
How's the job treating you?

24:59.966 --> 25:02.134
- Monotonous as the one
I had in prison,

25:02.168 --> 25:03.435
but feels like an accomplishment

25:03.469 --> 25:04.369
at the end of the day.

25:04.404 --> 25:05.748
- Well, accomplishment
is a good feeling.

25:05.772 --> 25:06.839
- Yeah.

25:06.873 --> 25:07.973
So is the end of the day.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.975
Yeah.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.076
- Yo, I need a favor.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.477
- Arrest a hooker.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.856
- No, no, I'm above that,
currently.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.329
I was hoping you could
reach out to your old connects.

25:18.364 --> 25:20.819
We need to find a fence
operating off Fulton.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.154
- They're a dime a dozen.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.666
- Yeah, but this one's
gonna be aggravated.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.179
He lost a lot of cash today.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.804
- It must be important,
you want me

25:28.828 --> 25:30.429
to take a step toward that life.

25:32.426 --> 25:34.533
- Only because I trust you
to come back.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.364
- It's amazing
you're in school.

25:39.398 --> 25:41.424
I'd be, like, fetal under my couch.

25:41.459 --> 25:43.185
- I don't really want
to talk about it.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.643
- Oh, my God.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.446
- First the thing
with your dad

25:47.480 --> 25:48.858
and then your mom in the hospital...

25:48.882 --> 25:49.915
- Low-key, please.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.184
- And now the best thing
to come along in forever,

25:52.218 --> 25:53.452
a really great guy...

25:53.486 --> 25:56.521
It's okay not to be okay.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.023
- I'm sorry,
is something funny?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.454
- Oh, no.
I love telenovelas.

26:00.489 --> 26:01.549
- One more time?

26:01.584 --> 26:03.795
- Nothing, just
the daddy issues,

26:03.830 --> 26:05.025
the hospital,

26:05.060 --> 26:06.258
the single-mama drama...

26:06.292 --> 26:07.459
- You're such a bitch, Lily.

26:07.459 --> 26:09.193
- No, no.

26:09.227 --> 26:10.160
Let her continue,

26:10.195 --> 26:12.196
since my life is clearly
so interesting to her.

26:12.230 --> 26:13.530
Not really.

26:13.565 --> 26:15.866
Your mom's, though... damn.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.545
All these men
that keep dying around her...

26:17.569 --> 26:19.603
Scandalous.

26:19.638 --> 26:21.271
- You want scandalous?

26:22.574 --> 26:23.774
- Cristina, no!

26:27.679 --> 26:28.846
- Girls, break it up!

26:31.985 --> 26:33.918
- Where you at?
- Right here, right here!

26:34.351 --> 26:35.529
- You sure this is our guy?

26:35.554 --> 26:36.969
- His name is Handles,

26:36.994 --> 26:38.540
and he's been turning
the streets upside down

26:38.565 --> 26:39.829
for a payment lost in transit.

26:39.854 --> 26:41.455
- It was stolen.

26:41.489 --> 26:43.123
I got the facial trauma to prove it.

26:43.158 --> 26:44.858
- You wear it well,
like an accessory.

26:44.893 --> 26:47.227
- Shut your mouth,
or we'll see who wore it best.

26:47.262 --> 26:48.506
- Well, I'm not sure
I'm doing you a favor

26:48.530 --> 26:50.898
by making the intro. This guy's no joke.

26:50.932 --> 26:52.232
This is the part

26:52.267 --> 26:54.168
where you turn back into a civilian.

26:54.202 --> 26:55.169
- Yeah.

26:55.203 --> 26:56.537
- Woz, we got a problem.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.905
<i>- We're on quite a streak.</i>

26:57.939 --> 26:59.506
A scale from one to ten.

26:59.541 --> 27:00.607
<i>- Harlee had Loman</i>

27:00.642 --> 27:02.810
request a warrant to access
the Red Hook dockyard.

27:02.844 --> 27:05.212
- That's a number
from one to ten?

27:05.246 --> 27:06.413
How'd you find out?

27:06.448 --> 27:07.591
- I saw a copy on Loman's desk.

27:07.615 --> 27:08.749
It's got to be connected.

27:08.783 --> 27:10.651
The longshoreman who got killed with Nava

27:10.685 --> 27:11.752
worked at Red Hook.

27:11.786 --> 27:12.886
- What's the target?

27:12.921 --> 27:14.221
<i>- It's a shipping container.</i>

27:14.255 --> 27:15.923
The ID code is 1-2-4-5...

27:15.957 --> 27:18.592
- All right, all right.
Just text it to me.

27:19.794 --> 27:21.261
- Trouble at the farm?

27:21.296 --> 27:23.664
- Nothing that Espada
can't get me to fix.

27:23.698 --> 27:25.766
Which one of you guys is Handles?

27:25.800 --> 27:27.167
<i>- ¿Quien pregunta?</i>

27:27.202 --> 27:28.168
- The guy you're looking for,

27:28.203 --> 27:29.243
only you don't know it yet.

27:29.277 --> 27:30.270
- You got my money?

27:30.304 --> 27:32.606
- I was ambushed,
but this slid under the seat.

27:32.640 --> 27:33.774
It's all yours.

27:33.808 --> 27:35.342
- What about Hector?

27:35.376 --> 27:37.845
- Coroner doesn't think
he's gonna make it.

27:37.879 --> 27:40.190
- I'm gonna need a full refund,

27:40.224 --> 27:41.759
or we start talking
about your car service

27:41.783 --> 27:44.055
to anyone who wants to listen. $200,000.

27:44.089 --> 27:45.855
- Oh, that's $200,000
too much.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.381
- Plus 10% for Hector.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.515
- Woz!

27:48.550 --> 27:50.317
- Don't put my crew in danger

27:50.351 --> 27:51.485
and then try to negotiate.

27:51.519 --> 27:52.715
It makes me hostile.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.488
- If I had known
this was gonna get violent,

27:54.522 --> 27:56.356
I would've brought my nine-year-old.

27:56.391 --> 27:57.958
That's you, right?

27:57.992 --> 28:00.394
Cop who got shot by a third grader?

28:00.428 --> 28:01.528
Word is,

28:01.563 --> 28:02.963
Quince is still out there,

28:02.997 --> 28:04.364
laughing his ass off.

28:04.399 --> 28:07.501
- It's the last laugh
that counts.

28:07.535 --> 28:10.237
You'll know it when you hear it.

28:12.907 --> 28:14.675
- Hard to laugh
with a bad back.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.147
- Have you met Cristina?

28:20.181 --> 28:22.082
Dean's list every year, straight As,

28:22.117 --> 28:24.485
no truancy, no probation!

28:24.519 --> 28:26.397
- Her record is outstanding.
That's not the issue.

28:26.421 --> 28:29.231
- Then why are we even
talking about suspension?

28:30.391 --> 28:31.592
- I'm aware how difficult

28:31.626 --> 28:33.160
this year must have been for you,

28:33.194 --> 28:34.528
with the stress of your job,

28:34.562 --> 28:36.853
with everything that's going on.

28:36.888 --> 28:38.853
A little time off might be the best thing

28:38.877 --> 28:39.867
we can do for her.

28:39.901 --> 28:41.278
- Maybe I should argue
with my checkbook.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.036
- That isn't what I'm saying.

28:43.071 --> 28:45.272
- Look, no one
understands more than me

28:45.306 --> 28:47.875
that violence is never the answer,

28:47.909 --> 28:50.110
but neither is taking away
the opportunities

28:50.145 --> 28:51.288
from a girl who already has to work

28:51.312 --> 28:53.447
twice as hard for them.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.415
She stood up to someone today

28:55.450 --> 28:57.635
who tried to make her feel small.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.620
You want to blame somebody for that?

28:59.654 --> 29:00.888
Blame me.

29:00.922 --> 29:01.889
I've been teaching her how to do that

29:01.923 --> 29:03.357
ever since she could walk.

29:06.561 --> 29:08.529
Should've never let you
come to school today.

29:08.563 --> 29:10.397
- Look, I'm sorry
you had to come.

29:10.431 --> 29:12.099
- Me too.

29:12.133 --> 29:14.234
- Mom, it was Lily Mather.
She said that you...

29:14.269 --> 29:16.904
- I don't care
what she said.

29:16.938 --> 29:19.206
You go to the best school
in Brooklyn, you know that?

29:19.240 --> 29:21.041
You can open any door.

29:21.075 --> 29:22.876
But if you can't
restrain yourself long enough

29:22.911 --> 29:24.411
to walk away from some entitled bitch,

29:24.445 --> 29:26.980
then you throw that future away.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.325
- How can you even think
about my future

29:28.349 --> 29:30.317
after everything
that's happened this morning?

29:30.351 --> 29:33.387
- How can I think
of anything else?

29:33.421 --> 29:35.055
- Mom, he's gone.

29:37.592 --> 29:39.093
- I can't.

29:40.495 --> 29:43.564
- Okay, well, how about
you buy me lunch?

29:43.598 --> 29:46.567
Burned a lot of calories
kicking that girl's ass.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.239
- I see my warnings
about taking it easy

29:52.273 --> 29:53.574
have gone unnoticed.

29:53.608 --> 29:57.110
- No, my wife knows them
verbatim.

29:57.145 --> 29:58.322
- Maybe she'll have
better luck.

29:58.346 --> 30:00.138
- I don't get paid
to do yoga.

30:00.172 --> 30:01.949
- Last I checked,

30:01.983 --> 30:04.484
the abdominal muscles
are relatively useful

30:04.519 --> 30:05.686
and worth the rest,

30:05.720 --> 30:07.187
and that's if you just pull them.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.655
- Do you have a diploma
on the wall

30:08.690 --> 30:10.357
that says I should listen to all this?

30:10.391 --> 30:12.459
- All right, on your back.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.663
Uh, just... just give me a minute.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.701
- I...

30:20.735 --> 30:23.103
I think we have
a chain-of-command issue here.

30:23.137 --> 30:25.706
- Uh, I just need some time.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.474
- Oh.

30:29.010 --> 30:30.544
Uh, don't worry about it. It happens.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.179
- When you got Helen of Troy
over there

30:32.213 --> 30:34.982
doing her flexibility exercises,

30:35.016 --> 30:36.802
it kinda makes it...

30:36.836 --> 30:39.530
- Uh, why don't you take a few
minutes, and I'll come back?

30:44.726 --> 30:46.560
- Hey.

30:46.594 --> 30:47.745
- Hey.

30:48.696 --> 30:50.631
- How'd it go?
- Uh, it's good.

30:50.665 --> 30:52.065
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.710
- Did he tell you
to listen to your wife?

30:55.236 --> 30:56.236
Hmm?

30:56.271 --> 30:58.238
- Let's get out of here.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.382
- Guess he took my side, huh?

31:01.175 --> 31:03.644
There's a definite caveman vibe
going on here.

31:03.678 --> 31:05.045
- Just go with it.

31:05.079 --> 31:06.680
- Uh-huh.

31:06.714 --> 31:08.048
<i>Fire</i>

31:11.286 --> 31:13.163
- I guess there are exceptions
to taking it easy.

31:13.187 --> 31:15.255
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.280
<i>Fire</i>

31:17.707 --> 31:20.441
- I hope that didn't set back
your recovery schedule.

31:20.936 --> 31:24.005
- Ha!
If it did, it was worth it.

31:24.782 --> 31:26.578
- You know, if there is
a silver lining

31:26.608 --> 31:28.449
to... to what happened,

31:28.859 --> 31:30.726
it's that it kept you home.

31:30.761 --> 31:32.698
- Hey, you should've shot me
years ago.

31:38.101 --> 31:39.935
- It'll get easier.

31:39.970 --> 31:42.772
- More months of foam rollers
and painkillers.

31:42.806 --> 31:45.344
- You're not taking
the painkillers, Matt.

31:45.809 --> 31:47.109
I see you.

31:47.144 --> 31:49.045
I see the war going on in your head.

31:49.079 --> 31:50.913
I know that bullet broke things

31:50.947 --> 31:53.783
that can't be fixed with foam rollers.

31:53.817 --> 31:56.480
- Mm, maybe I broke myself.

31:57.821 --> 31:58.965
- Well, you have always
been able

31:58.989 --> 32:00.389
to put it back together again.

32:00.424 --> 32:02.224
- I don't know.

32:02.259 --> 32:04.927
I've been gone a long time.

32:04.961 --> 32:07.263
The crew had to go
and find their own things.

32:07.297 --> 32:08.864
- There's no crew without you.

32:11.301 --> 32:13.769
They may not appreciate it,

32:13.804 --> 32:16.041
but they need their leader.

32:16.740 --> 32:19.809
- What if he died
on the precinct floor that day?

32:22.079 --> 32:25.815
- Then you do what it takes
to revive him.

32:31.421 --> 32:32.788
- Still got that number?

32:32.823 --> 32:34.723
- Memorized.

32:34.758 --> 32:36.158
Head on a swivel, Loman.

32:36.193 --> 32:37.159
- They don't know
we're here.

32:37.194 --> 32:38.794
That warrant is classified.

32:38.829 --> 32:39.972
- It's Intelligence
we're talking about.

32:39.996 --> 32:41.397
Nothing's classified.

32:41.431 --> 32:42.898
- So maybe we should
radio it in.

32:42.933 --> 32:44.166
- No.

32:44.201 --> 32:46.405
I don't want to call
any unwanted attention.

32:47.322 --> 32:49.405
- You trust this guy?
Cole?

32:49.439 --> 32:50.473
- I didn't say that.

32:50.507 --> 32:52.408
- You're acting
on his intel.

32:52.442 --> 32:54.143
- Intel he didn't know
he was spilling.

32:54.177 --> 32:56.979
He doesn't know about Nava's last text.

32:57.013 --> 32:58.981
- You sure about that?

32:59.015 --> 33:00.416
Look, I looked this guy up.

33:00.450 --> 33:03.452
A lot of black-op stuff,
files I couldn't access.

33:03.487 --> 33:06.216
Doesn't seem the kind of guy
to ask for help.

33:07.057 --> 33:08.290
- Here it is.

33:08.325 --> 33:10.025
Nava sent those numbers for a reason,

33:10.060 --> 33:12.328
and I don't need to trust this guy

33:12.362 --> 33:14.308
to use what he knows.

33:15.298 --> 33:16.465
All right.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.933
Pull, Loman.

33:17.968 --> 33:19.345
Let's see what was worth killing for.

33:24.842 --> 33:27.237
Not exactly the lead I was hoping for.

33:27.811 --> 33:29.345
Come on, Harlee, let's go.

33:29.379 --> 33:30.779
There's nothing here.

33:36.486 --> 33:38.454
God, when does it stop?

33:41.057 --> 33:42.224
I can't.

33:42.259 --> 33:44.460
I can't. I can't do this anymore.

33:44.494 --> 33:47.363
I can't do it anymore. I can't...

33:47.397 --> 33:48.831
He was wrong.

33:48.865 --> 33:50.799
- No, don't say that.
- You can't save me.

33:50.834 --> 33:53.903
There's no forgiveness.
There's no going back.

33:53.937 --> 33:56.172
- Harlee, don't say that.

33:57.908 --> 33:59.041
- Harlee, stop.

33:59.075 --> 34:00.843
- Everything!
Everything that I touch!

34:00.877 --> 34:02.211
Everything!

34:02.245 --> 34:03.479
- Stop!

34:03.513 --> 34:05.214
Stop, stop, stop!

34:05.248 --> 34:06.382
Stop!

34:06.416 --> 34:08.317
Stop. Stop.

34:26.101 --> 34:27.870
How did you get my cell?

34:27.904 --> 34:29.114
- The container was empty,
wasn't it?

34:29.139 --> 34:31.072
- What, are you following me?

34:31.107 --> 34:33.909
- No, I was following
the person who got there first.

34:33.944 --> 34:36.178
- Ramsey didn't have
the number.

34:36.213 --> 34:38.214
- He got it.

34:38.248 --> 34:39.380
Wozniak made a deal.

34:40.884 --> 34:43.252
- No, Woz wouldn't do that.

34:43.286 --> 34:45.521
- You sure?

34:45.554 --> 34:47.065
There's no limit to what my boss would do

34:47.090 --> 34:48.123
to get what he wants.

34:52.562 --> 34:55.264
Okay.

34:55.297 --> 34:57.786
And what did he get for his services?

34:58.568 --> 35:00.035
- Closure.

35:02.839 --> 35:03.973
Say hello, Quince.

35:07.010 --> 35:08.110
Why bring him to me?

35:08.144 --> 35:10.279
- I convinced Ramsey
that it would divide your crew.

35:10.313 --> 35:12.134
Between you and me...

35:12.916 --> 35:14.049
I thought you should know.

35:17.153 --> 35:19.154
The game is rigged, Harlee.

35:19.189 --> 35:21.290
Two solo acts are not gonna cut it.

35:25.262 --> 35:26.940
- I'd have to trust you.

35:27.964 --> 35:29.565
- Well, we're halfway there.

35:29.599 --> 35:31.934
Now I know I can trust you.

35:31.968 --> 35:33.602
We're in the same position,

35:33.637 --> 35:35.271
and the sooner you realize that,

35:35.305 --> 35:36.992
the better.

35:38.041 --> 35:40.454
- You don't know anything
about my position.

35:41.044 --> 35:42.311
Right? Or me.

35:42.345 --> 35:45.014
- I know one thing:
we're both tied to men

35:45.048 --> 35:46.348
who make us do things like this.

35:48.018 --> 35:49.318
- What the hell are you doing?

35:49.352 --> 35:50.986
- What I'm told!

35:51.021 --> 35:52.841
I'm sure you know how that feels

35:53.623 --> 35:55.924
and why doing the right thing

35:55.959 --> 35:58.221
is a luxury better left for other people.

35:59.496 --> 36:01.597
Second leg of the delivery is yours.

36:13.137 --> 36:15.191
- Son of a bitch!

36:15.216 --> 36:17.109
- They're not the terms
you agreed on?

36:17.296 --> 36:19.207
- No, I didn't know
I had to specify "breathing."

36:19.231 --> 36:20.341
- Yeah, I'm running low
on sympathy.

36:21.745 --> 36:24.281
- Hey, how about some sympathy
for the nine-year-old kid

36:24.306 --> 36:27.341
whose life was ruined
because of this guy?

36:27.375 --> 36:29.143
I went to see Ramsey

36:29.177 --> 36:30.778
to make sure that you were safe.

36:30.812 --> 36:33.213
He had requests. I had requests.

36:33.248 --> 36:34.792
- That's right,
keep defending yourself.

36:34.816 --> 36:36.216
Double down on the betrayal.

36:36.251 --> 36:39.119
- You really wanna
go down that road, Harlee?

36:41.756 --> 36:44.059
- I needed you today.

36:44.759 --> 36:47.227
Everything that I know

36:47.262 --> 36:48.814
is broken.

36:50.332 --> 36:52.733
I'm broken.

36:52.767 --> 36:55.235
And you made me think that I was crazy!

36:55.270 --> 36:58.138
- Yeah, but at least
you get to go home tonight.

36:58.173 --> 37:00.174
Whether you want to admit it or not,

37:00.208 --> 37:02.543
trauma has its fallout,

37:02.577 --> 37:04.411
and until you're right again,

37:04.446 --> 37:06.747
I had to get the target off of your back.

37:06.781 --> 37:07.892
- Oh, so this had
nothing to do

37:07.916 --> 37:09.483
with you and your vengeance quest?

37:09.517 --> 37:11.552
- This is about you
getting to see

37:11.586 --> 37:13.454
Cristina grow up.

37:14.723 --> 37:17.424
Ramsey's more dangerous than you realize.

37:17.459 --> 37:19.426
- Than <i>I</i> realize?

37:19.461 --> 37:20.594
Nava's dead.

37:22.230 --> 37:24.724
And his killer probably wears a badge.

37:25.900 --> 37:28.335
- Until I take it from him.

37:28.370 --> 37:30.871
- You know what
the real tragedy is here?

37:30.905 --> 37:32.439
That the next time you're actually

37:32.474 --> 37:34.174
trying to protect me,

37:34.209 --> 37:35.876
I'm gonna wonder if I'm being played.

37:35.910 --> 37:38.178
- Won't stop me
from doing it again,

37:38.213 --> 37:40.280
so take your grief and your guilt

37:40.315 --> 37:42.349
and take it all out on me.

37:42.384 --> 37:44.218
At least it keeps you alive.

37:48.256 --> 37:49.223
- Give me your keys.

37:51.826 --> 37:53.293
I'm taking your car.

37:58.266 --> 38:00.267
I'm glad you got your revenge, Woz.

38:02.837 --> 38:05.739
I hope that it cures
everything that you need it to.

38:20.355 --> 38:22.523
- I have a speech prepared.
Do you want to hear it?

38:23.691 --> 38:26.560
- Uh, I think it's more
of a Cliff Notes night, baby.

38:26.594 --> 38:28.872
- At its core,
it's an apology, but...

38:29.364 --> 38:30.731
I still effectively maintain

38:30.765 --> 38:32.533
that family is worth defending.

38:33.001 --> 38:34.668
- I agree,

38:34.702 --> 38:36.503
but what some girl says at school

38:36.538 --> 38:38.757
is not something you have
to defend me against.

38:39.607 --> 38:41.218
I've gotten through worse.

38:42.844 --> 38:44.604
- Do you think
you're gonna get through this?

38:47.215 --> 38:48.849
- Well, I got a pretty
damn good reason

38:48.883 --> 38:50.417
to make sure that I do.

38:56.891 --> 38:59.861
Look, I know this hasn't been easy.

39:00.662 --> 39:02.739
You've had to deal with things that...

39:04.566 --> 39:06.733
most people would never even understand.

39:10.038 --> 39:11.672
You must feel...

39:11.706 --> 39:13.307
- Frustrated.

39:15.243 --> 39:16.477
A little.

39:18.413 --> 39:20.280
It's mostly just because I can tell

39:20.315 --> 39:22.683
that there's something
going on beneath the surface.

39:27.355 --> 39:29.432
You don't always
have to be strong for me.

39:30.492 --> 39:32.310
It can work both ways.

39:32.994 --> 39:34.479
We're a team.

39:34.896 --> 39:36.029
- A pretty damn good one.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.776
- Always will be.

39:40.602 --> 39:42.153
- I can handle the truth.

39:43.371 --> 39:45.073
I'm not a kid anymore.

39:46.674 --> 39:48.326
- Truth about what?

39:50.378 --> 39:51.820
- Why Nava was killed.

39:55.177 --> 39:56.375
Do you know?

40:04.592 --> 40:06.360
- It was a revenge killing.

40:08.963 --> 40:11.598
Ex-con who just got released.

40:11.633 --> 40:15.536
Nava was the prosecutor
who secured his conviction

40:15.570 --> 40:17.230
five years ago.

40:18.315 --> 40:20.040
- I'm so sorry, Mom.

40:22.110 --> 40:23.777
They get the guy?

40:27.549 --> 40:28.982
- Woz got him.

40:30.385 --> 40:31.618
- Where you at, man?

40:31.653 --> 40:33.063
- Right here,
right here, right here!

40:34.556 --> 40:36.790
- Not bad for a grandma,
my man.

40:36.824 --> 40:38.959
- There, get his side, now!

40:38.993 --> 40:40.127
- All right, all right.

40:40.161 --> 40:41.361
All right.
- Yo, you need to...

40:41.396 --> 40:42.863
- Yo, Hobo.

40:44.065 --> 40:45.732
Right on time.

40:45.767 --> 40:47.868
Beautiful night for a refund.

40:47.902 --> 40:49.703
You got my $200K, right?

40:49.737 --> 40:51.471
- I always deliver.

40:51.506 --> 40:53.140
Come on, let's take a walk.

40:53.174 --> 40:54.893
- Facing reality.

40:55.610 --> 40:57.020
Good on you.

40:58.188 --> 40:59.780
- I knew this kid

40:59.814 --> 41:02.416
from the projects of New Lots.

41:02.450 --> 41:04.885
Grew up with absolutely nothing.

41:04.919 --> 41:07.721
He didn't have a pot to piss in.

41:07.755 --> 41:09.656
But eventually, he crawled himself

41:09.691 --> 41:11.558
out of that poverty.

41:11.593 --> 41:13.660
He did whatever he had to do,

41:13.695 --> 41:16.039
built himself a kingdom,

41:16.598 --> 41:18.966
and then once he got on top,

41:19.167 --> 41:20.834
he got cocky.

41:20.868 --> 41:23.003
He got lazy.

41:23.037 --> 41:25.005
Foolish.

41:25.039 --> 41:26.773
He made a bad choice.

41:26.808 --> 41:28.475
- Hold up. Is that Quince?

41:28.509 --> 41:32.012
- Yeah, he went up against
the wrong adversary.

41:33.047 --> 41:34.114
- Oh!
- Oh!

41:34.148 --> 41:36.817
- I think our debt is paid.

41:36.851 --> 41:37.928
Unless you have any objections.

41:37.952 --> 41:39.820
- No, we're cool.
Forget the cash.

41:47.662 --> 41:48.862
- You want a turn?

41:48.896 --> 41:52.766
- Nah, twice dead
is good enough for me.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.601
- Thanks for the assist
today.

41:54.636 --> 41:56.746
You just bought me some sleep.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.807
- What?

42:00.842 --> 42:03.143
- It's good to be back.
