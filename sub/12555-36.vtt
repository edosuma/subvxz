05:41.925 --> 05:44.292
I COULDN'T
POSSIBLY GUESS.

05:44.386 --> 05:49.051
I THOUGHT I SAVV A
VVOMAN IN YOUR ARMS.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.887
DID YOU?

05:55.981 --> 05:58.689
YES. ISN'T THAT JUST
TOO RIDICULOUS?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.516
YES, YES, IT IS.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.476
OH, WELL, LISTEN--

06:02.571 --> 06:03.857
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE

06:03.947 --> 06:04.982
WELL...

06:05.073 --> 06:06.484
OH, LET ME, LET ME.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.236
SHE HAD MASSES
OF BLONDE HAIR

06:08.326 --> 06:10.283
AND SHE WORE ONE OF THOSE
FRUMPY LITTLE BLOUSES

06:10.370 --> 06:12.611
WITH A TACKY LITTLE
BROOCH AT THE BOSOM

06:12.664 --> 06:15.452

<i>DREADFUL</i> PEASANT SKIRTS.

QUITE REMARKABLE.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.837
YES. ISN'T IT?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.543
OF COURSE,
IF I'D THOUGHT ABOUT IT

06:27.637 --> 06:30.470
I WOULD HAVE REALIZED
HOW RIDICULOUS IT WAS.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.017
I WOULD HAVE REALIZED

06:32.100 --> 06:33.602
IF I HAD THOUGHT
ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE

06:33.685 --> 06:36.848
THAT A MAN OF YOUR
EXTRAORDINARY TASTE

06:45.822 --> 06:47.654
AHA.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.691
DIDN'T THINK I'D BE HOME
SO EARLY, DID YOU?

06:50.785 --> 06:53.527
DIDN'T THINK I'D BE HOME

06:53.622 --> 06:55.579
THOUGHT YOU HAD ME
FOOLED, DIDN'T YOU?

06:55.665 --> 06:57.372
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.496
I'VE HAD MY EYE ON YOU
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.668
DIDN'T THINK I SUSPECTED
THE REAL REASON

07:01.713 --> 07:04.330
FOR VVHY YOU VVERE ALVVAYS
SENDING ME OUT OF THE HOUSE,

07:04.382 --> 07:05.884
DID YOU?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.344
"I MUST BE ALONE TO

07:15.101 --> 07:16.808
I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.762
DO YOU REMEMBER MY PLAY,
FURY <i>IN</i> THE NIGHT?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.722

OH, YES.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.442
YOU REMEMBER THE CHARACTER
PHILIP VVAINVVRIGHT?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.611
GREGORY, JUST
TELL ME ONE THING.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.688
WHAT'S HER NAME?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.773
WHAT?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.073
WHAT'S HER NAME?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.275
MARY! BUT
THAT DOESN'T--

07:33.370 --> 07:34.781
"MARY!" HOW COMMON.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.453
PLEASE, VICTORIA--

07:36.539 --> 07:39.201
JUST SIT DOWN HERE
AND LET ME EXPLAIN.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.706
I'M LISTENING.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.580
YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES
I'VE TOLD YOU

07:42.671 --> 07:45.538
THAT FICTIONAL CHARACTERS
COME ALIVE SO VIVIDLY

07:45.632 --> 07:47.373
<i>THEY MAKE DECISIONS
OF THEIR OWN?</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:49.049
A PLAYWRIGHT MAY
HAVE WORKED OUT

07:49.135 --> 07:50.921
SOME KIND
OF MOVE FOR THEM

07:51.012 --> 07:52.878
BUT THEY
REFUSE TO DO IT.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.635
THEY VVILL NOT ACCEPT ANYBODY'S-
THEY BECOME SO STRONG

07:55.725 --> 07:58.433
THAT SOMETIMES THEY TAKE
OVER THE WHOLE STORY!

07:58.520 --> 08:00.727
I HARDLY SEE THAT
THIS HAS ANYTHING...

08:00.814 --> 08:02.646
PLEASE BEAR
WITH ME, VICTORIA.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.941
I'VE <i>BORNE</i> WITH
YOU FOR YEARS.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.985
PHILIP VVAINVVRIGHT VVAS THE
FIRST ONE OF MY PLAY CHARACTERS

08:09.072 --> 08:10.562
TO EVER BEHAVE LIKE THAT.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.568
NO MATTER WHAT I HAD
PLANNED FOR HIM,

08:12.617 --> 08:14.483
HE BALKED, HE REFUSED.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.490
HE WOULDN'T ACCEPT
ANY OF MY DECISIONS.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.163
HE BECAME ALIVE--
WITH A WILL OF HIS OWN!

08:20.250 --> 08:22.287
<i>DO YOU UNDERSTAND?</i>

08:22.377 --> 08:25.165
<i>I UNDERSTAND</i> THAT <i>YOU ARE

08:25.255 --> 08:26.586
<i>I'M NOT!</i>

08:26.673 --> 08:28.163
<i>THIS</i> IS <i>THE SUBJECT.</i>

08:28.258 --> 08:30.169
<i>PHILIP WAINWRIGHT

08:30.260 --> 08:33.342
ONE NIGHT, VVHILE I
VVAS VVORKING HERE-

08:33.429 --> 08:39.015
RIGHT UP HERE
IN MY OFFICE--

08:39.102 --> 08:41.594
PHILIP VVAINVVRIGHT VVALKED
IN THROUGH THAT DOOR.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.638
OH, GREG,
NOW, REALLY.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.771
VICTORIA, YOU'VE
GOT TO BELIEVE ME!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.693
HE WALKED IN RIGHT
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.521
<i>HE CAME IN HERE,
AND HE SAT DOWN</i>

08:52.615 --> 08:54.697
IN THAT CHAIR...

08:54.784 --> 08:56.946
ALIVE...

08:57.037 --> 08:59.825
<i>A REAL FLESH
AND BLOOD MAN!</i>

09:02.250 --> 09:03.706
AND I CREATED HIM.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.952
OH, MY.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.714
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:15.805 --> 09:18.388
I AM AFRAID THAT PSYCHIATRY
IS NEXT ON THE AGENDA.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.716
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE
ME, VICTORIA.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.801
CHARACTERS IN MY PLAYS
DO COME ALIVE.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.470
I'VE SEEN THEM,
TALKED TO THEM.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.305
I'VE EVEN SHAKEN
HANDS VVITH THEM.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.561
YOU EVEN MADE LOVE
TO THEM, REMEMBER?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.642
YES... I MEAN NO!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.980
LOOK, YOU KNOW HOW I WORK.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.739
I DICTATE DIALOG
AND STAGE BUSINESS

09:35.825 --> 09:37.202
INTO THE TAPE RECORDER.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.401
I DESCRIBE
ANY CHARACTER I WANT

09:39.496 --> 09:43.330
AND IF I DO IT WELL ENOUGH,
THEY COME TO LIFE--

09:43.374 --> 09:45.160
TO LIFE, VICTORIA.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.083
AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERS

09:47.170 --> 09:49.002
IN MY PLAYS ANYMORE.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.085
I CAN DESCRIBE
ANY CHARACTER I WANT!

09:52.175 --> 09:55.008
YOU SHOULD BE
PUT AWAY.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.181
NOW, YOU SAID THAT YOU
SAW MARY HERE, RIGHT?

10:01.267 --> 10:03.178
OH, I SAVV HER HERE, ALL RIGHT.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.390
THEN HOW DID
SHE GET OUT?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.687
THAT'S VVHAT I'M
TRYING TO FIND OUT.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.612
SHE COULD NOT HAVE GONE
OUT THROUGH THE VVINDOVV.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.782
YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO
SECRET DOORS IN HERE.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.610
BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW SHE GOT OUT OF HERE

10:21.704 --> 10:23.445
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.300
I TAKE MY SCISSORS,

10:36.386 --> 10:38.093
I SNIP OFF THE PART OF THE TAPE

10:38.179 --> 10:41.547
ON WHICH
SHE IS DESCRIBED,

10:41.599 --> 10:46.560
I ROLL THE TAPE
INTO A LITTLE BALL,

10:46.646 --> 10:49.809
I THROW IT
INTO THE FIREPLACE,

10:49.899 --> 10:52.732
SHE'S GONE!

10:52.777 --> 10:54.017
UNCREATED.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.526
I'M GOING TO
HAVE YOU COMMITTED.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.443
YOU'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE ME.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.073
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.575
NOW, JUST A MINUTE.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.159
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
OUR MARRIAGE.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.910
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.333
I COULD DESCRIBE A DOG OR A CAT
OR ANY CHARACTER YOU VVANT

11:17.427 --> 11:19.839
BUT I'M SURE YOU WOULD
PREFER TO SEE MARY

11:19.929 --> 11:21.670
AND I'VE CREATED MARY
SO MANY TIMES,

11:21.764 --> 11:23.175
THAT SHE'LL BE
MUCH MORE AVAILABLE.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.756
I'LL JUST BET SHE IS.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.675
GIVE ME THE KEY, GREGORY.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.763
HER NAM E--IS MARY.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.770
<i>SHE'S 30 YEARS OLD...</i>

11:33.860 --> 11:36.693
FIVE FEET
SIX INCHES TALL,

11:36.779 --> 11:38.861
NICELY BUILT,

11:38.948 --> 11:40.859
BLOND HAIR,

11:40.950 --> 11:43.157
FAIR COMPLEXION,

11:43.244 --> 11:45.281
A SIMPLE,
UNASSUMING FEMALE,

11:45.330 --> 11:48.038
BUT WITH THAT QUALITY
OF INNER LOVELINESS

11:48.124 --> 11:50.866
THAT BRINGS REAL
BEAUTY TO A WOMAN.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.667
A TENDER,
GENTLE WOMAN...

11:52.754 --> 11:55.872
AN UNDERSTANDING WOMAN.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.048

YOU LET HER OUT OF HERE
THROUGH A SECRET DOOR,

13:31.269 --> 13:33.226
THEN YOU TELL ME
THIS RIDICULOUS STORY

13:33.271 --> 13:34.853
ABOUT BRINGING
CHARACTERS TO LIFE.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.475
THEN YOU LOCK THE DOOR

13:36.566 --> 13:38.148
AND PRETEND TO BRING
HER BACK TO LIFE.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.645
THEN SHE COMES
IN THE FRONT DOOR

13:39.736 --> 13:41.397
AND TRIES TO MAKE
ME BELIEVE THAT--

13:41.487 --> 13:43.979
YOU'RE TRYING
TO DRIVE ME INSANE.

YOU WANT TO HAVE
ME COMMITTED.

HAVE ME COMMITTED.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.068
YOU WANT
TO HAVE ME COMMITTED

ALL OF OUR PROPERTY

13:58.963 --> 14:01.341
NOW, PLEASE TRY TO
UNDERSTAND, MARY.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.335
AFTER ALL, VICTORIA IS MY VVIFE.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.916

14:04.969 --> 14:06.926

DIABOLIC CONSPIRACY.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.427
CAN'T I DO
ANYTHING RIGHT?

14:08.514 --> 14:09.845
NO.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.673

14:13.269 --> 14:16.603
YES.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.773
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.017
YOU LET ME OUT OF HERE,
YOU MONSTER.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.773
GREGORY VVEST, YOU
LET ME OUT OF HERE

14:24.864 --> 14:26.320
OR I'M GOING

14:26.407 --> 14:27.863
I PROMISE YOU,
I'M GOING TO SCREAM.

14:27.950 --> 14:28.940

14:33.623 --> 14:35.330
VVHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME, GREG?

14:35.416 --> 14:38.033
OH, I'M SORRY,
MARY, BUT...

14:38.127 --> 14:40.289
<i>WHAT ELSE

14:44.967 --> 14:46.503
WHAT ELSE
CAN I DO?

14:46.594 --> 14:49.552
THAT'S ALL YOU EVER SAY.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.264
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME, HUH?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.638
<i>YOU JUST GOT TO MAKE
ME SHOW YOU, HUH'?</i>

14:55.686 --> 14:59.975
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE ME FORCE
POOR MARY TO LEAVE AGAIN.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.057
VICTORIA...

15:02.151 --> 15:03.983
SOMETIMES I WONDER.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.481
<i>DON'T BRING ME
BACK AGAIN.</i>

15:07.490 --> 15:08.571
NOW, MARY...

15:08.658 --> 15:10.490
JUST... DON'T.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.493
I CAN'T BEAR
IT ANY LONGER.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.996
OH...

15:19.210 --> 15:21.326
FORGIVE ME, MARY

15:21.421 --> 15:22.582
BUT SHE IS MY WIFE.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.090
WHERE IS SHE?

15:31.180 --> 15:35.174
I TOLD YOU.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.762
WH-WHERE IS SHE?

15:36.853 --> 15:40.266
YOU STILL DON'T
BELIEVE ME, HUH?

15:40.356 --> 15:43.894
GREGORY, WHERE DID SHE GO?

15:43.985 --> 15:45.771
<i>I TOLD YOU!</i>

15:45.862 --> 15:48.103

15:48.197 --> 15:49.278
UNCREATED HER.

OH, DEAR.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.447
<i>NOW, DON'T

WE WON'T LET IT
HAPPEN ANYMORE.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.202
I PROMISE YOU,
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.125
THE ONLY REASON I
DID IT THE FIRST TIME

16:02.211 --> 16:04.373
WAS THAT, WELL,
I WAS LONELY.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.875
DON'T YOU SEE,
VICTORIA?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.831
YOU'RE SO PERFECT

CREATED MARY.</i>

16:14.599 --> 16:16.385
I DIDN'T CREATE HER
TO INSULT YOU.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.932
I WAS LONELY,
THAT WAS ALL.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.555
I WANTED SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.470
OH...

16:21.564 --> 16:24.647
SOMEONE THAT I'D
FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.691

16:26.777 --> 16:28.484
WELL, YOU UNDERSTAND,
DON'T YOU?

16:28.571 --> 16:30.938
OH, YES, I UNDERSTAND.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.739
OH, FINE.

I FEEL SO INADEQUATE

16:36.996 --> 16:39.237
COMPARED WITH YOU.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.076

THAT'S REALLY MY FAULT.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.365
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE...

16:46.297 --> 16:48.254
NOW, DON'T TRY
TO STOP ME, GREGORY.
