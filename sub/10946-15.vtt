00:00.357 --> 00:01.644
<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:01.664 --> 00:03.413
Why am I the only one
who has to give up everything?!

00:03.433 --> 00:05.378
I have given up just as much
in this relationship

00:05.398 --> 00:07.340
and you know it!

00:07.374 --> 00:09.475
Peter: We can't go on like this.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.478
Lou: No, we can't.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.480
Peter and I have had
terrible fights,

00:14.515 --> 00:16.708
but never anything like this.

00:16.968 --> 00:18.383
I just wanna talk to him
about it.

00:18.403 --> 00:19.698
He says we'll talk
when he gets back,

00:19.718 --> 00:21.994
but I don't think
I can wait that long.

00:22.014 --> 00:23.455
I think this is the type
of conversation

00:23.489 --> 00:25.991
that you should have in person.

00:26.272 --> 00:28.518
I need to go to Vancouver.

00:28.538 --> 00:31.385
Tim: Shane writes, "you'll
never believe this.

00:31.405 --> 00:34.103
Mom's getting married,
dot, dot, dot...

00:34.123 --> 00:38.006
This Saturday - in capitals -
exclamation mark!

00:38.604 --> 00:40.935
Ty: I'm gonna visit my mom.

00:41.507 --> 00:43.675
I wanna help her
stay clean this time.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.277
Amy: I still wanna
come with you.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.435
Ty: I want you to come too,

00:47.455 --> 00:49.916
but I gotta think about
what's best for my mom.

00:52.398 --> 00:54.297
(Insects buzz, car rumbles)

01:02.061 --> 01:03.861
<i>Limo driver: Excuse me, miss?</i>

01:03.896 --> 01:05.930
I'm sorry. Pardon me?

01:05.964 --> 01:07.967
<i>Limo driver:
Where are we turning off?</i>

01:07.987 --> 01:10.690
Stay on the highway
till we get to foothills pass,

01:10.710 --> 01:12.135
<i>then head east.</i>

01:12.170 --> 01:13.804
(Car rumbles)

01:17.349 --> 01:18.909
'Kay, you ready?

01:18.943 --> 01:20.511
Caleb: Let's see what
this bad boy can do.

01:20.545 --> 01:22.813
(Gate clanks open,
horse whinnies)

01:25.016 --> 01:26.316
<i>Tim: That's it?!</i>

01:26.871 --> 01:28.885
C'mon. Seriously?

01:28.920 --> 01:31.755
<i>Bring him in, Bo.</i>

01:31.789 --> 01:33.957
<i>There's not enough buck
in that horse.</i>

01:33.991 --> 01:35.959
<i>Jack: Looks like you
got a live one there.</i>

01:35.993 --> 01:37.427
Tim: Pathetic.

01:37.461 --> 01:40.129
Now that's a bit harsh.

01:40.163 --> 01:41.764
<i>Tim: Be good for a trail horse.</i>

01:41.798 --> 01:43.399
I need a gentle horse
with a little buck.

01:43.434 --> 01:45.935
Well, that's tough to find.

01:45.969 --> 01:47.803
- Tim: You're telling me.
- Caleb: Look, I gotta get going.

01:47.838 --> 01:49.472
I was supposed to meet
Jesse an hour ago.

01:49.506 --> 01:51.507
Tim:
Yeah, we're done here anyway.

01:51.542 --> 01:53.976
Jack: So how's Shane?
You called him, right?

01:54.010 --> 01:55.945
Yeah, we had a chat.

01:55.979 --> 01:59.248
- Jack: And?
- Tim: And what?

01:59.282 --> 02:02.284
Well, is he okay
with Miranda's wedding or not?

02:02.318 --> 02:05.020
Tim: I... I... was just
reading into things.

02:05.055 --> 02:06.622
(Tim grunts) He's fine.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.449
Um, so I'm good.

02:10.469 --> 02:12.394
Jack: You're not planning on
doing something stupid are you?

02:12.428 --> 02:14.159
Tim: What do you mean?

02:14.179 --> 02:16.331
Jack: I don't know. Like
driving to moose jaw

02:16.366 --> 02:18.967
and making a fool of yourself.

02:19.001 --> 02:20.302
I said Shane's fine with it.

02:20.336 --> 02:22.646
Yeah... What about you?

02:25.587 --> 02:27.113
Amy: Okay...

02:28.378 --> 02:30.084
Georgie: don't put that there.

02:30.104 --> 02:31.803
What? Why?

02:31.823 --> 02:33.447
Georgie: Because I need to keep
the parts from the telescope

02:33.482 --> 02:35.054
separate from the parts
on the mount.

02:35.074 --> 02:35.791
Amy: Okay.

02:35.811 --> 02:37.392
Georgie: It's hard
enough setting this thing up.

02:37.412 --> 02:38.953
<i>(Door opens)</i>

02:38.988 --> 02:41.222
Georgie: They're here!

02:41.257 --> 02:43.391
Katie: Aw. It's just G.G.

02:43.425 --> 02:46.727
Jack: Oh, I'm so sorry
to disappoint you.

02:46.762 --> 02:48.721
Georgie: (Sighs) Lou and
Peter should be back by now.

02:48.741 --> 02:50.331
What's all this?

02:50.365 --> 02:52.333
There's a lunar eclipse
tomorrow night.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.568
Georgie: Yeah, I
borrowed a telescope from school.

02:54.603 --> 02:56.671
Jack: Well, it looks
pretty complicated.

02:56.705 --> 02:58.839
Georgie: Yeah. Peter
can help me set it up.

02:58.873 --> 03:00.974
We're gonna watch it
from the barn loft.

03:01.009 --> 03:03.143
<i>Amy: Hey, guys, a
car just pulled in.</i>

03:03.178 --> 03:05.228
Georgie: They're home!

03:05.713 --> 03:07.214
(Screen door opens, Amy giggles)

03:07.248 --> 03:08.849
(Car door opens and shuts)

03:08.883 --> 03:11.484
<i>Lou: Oh my God!</i>

03:11.519 --> 03:13.320
- I missed you guys!
- Georgie: Hi, mom!

03:13.354 --> 03:16.056
Come here! Look at you.

03:16.090 --> 03:17.791
(Gasps) And you!

03:17.826 --> 03:20.360
Have you been eating
growing beans again?

03:20.394 --> 03:22.662
Have you? Look at you.

03:22.697 --> 03:24.497
Georgie:
Uh, where-where's Peter?

03:24.532 --> 03:26.899
Lou: Oh, honey, he had
to stay in Vancouver.

03:26.934 --> 03:29.502
What? He said he would be here.
He promised.

03:29.537 --> 03:31.904
<i>Lou: I know. Something
came up at work, okay?</i>

03:31.939 --> 03:33.888
I'm really sorry, Georgie.

03:33.908 --> 03:36.135
(Sighs)

03:36.155 --> 03:39.578
Jack: Good to see you, Lou.
Glad you're back.

03:39.612 --> 03:42.481

Yeah...</i>

say he can't make it.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.766
Jack: Oh, Tim's turning
down a free meal?

04:35.786 --> 04:37.301
What's going on there?

04:37.335 --> 04:38.870
Amy: I don't know. Something
about having to plan something

04:38.904 --> 04:40.237
for the next couple days.

04:40.272 --> 04:42.739
Probably has to do
with his rodeo school.

Oh, Lou, no offense

but it's good to have you back.

04:48.813 --> 04:51.782
Lou:
Well, it is good to be back.

04:51.816 --> 04:54.718
Not that Vancouver wasn't fun.
It was... great.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.021
You know we had walks
on the seawall,

04:57.055 --> 04:58.955
picnics on the beach.

04:58.989 --> 05:01.291
We even drove up to Whistler.

05:01.325 --> 05:04.694
It was a nice vacation,
but... this is home.

05:04.729 --> 05:06.463
Georgie:
What came up at Peter's work?

05:06.497 --> 05:08.364
You know,
I'm not too sure, honey,

05:08.399 --> 05:11.635
but it sounded...
pretty important.

05:11.669 --> 05:14.137
Well, will he be back
for the eclipse tomorrow?

05:14.171 --> 05:16.406
I don't think so, sweetie.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.107
Well, then how am I supposed
to set up my telescope?

05:18.142 --> 05:19.475
Jack: I'll help you, Georgie.

05:19.509 --> 05:21.311
Lou: There you go!

05:21.345 --> 05:23.479
You know how to set up
an equatorial mount?

05:23.513 --> 05:27.450
Well, no,
but how hard can it be?

05:30.354 --> 05:32.777
Have you picked out
a wedding venue?

05:32.797 --> 05:33.656
Not yet.

05:33.690 --> 05:35.324
Oh, Amy...

05:35.358 --> 05:37.593
Ty and I have been
really busy, okay?

05:37.627 --> 05:41.129
Okay. Well,
how about a wedding dress?

05:41.164 --> 05:44.800
Amy: (Sighs) Lou: You do realize that
your wedding is about a month away.

05:44.835 --> 05:47.135
I know, I know. And Lisa has
been on my case since you left.

05:47.170 --> 05:49.671
Apparently not enough.

05:49.705 --> 05:51.606
But it's good thing
I am back to crack the whip.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.241
Um, by the way, where's Ty?

05:53.276 --> 05:55.210
Amy: He's visiting his mom.

05:55.244 --> 05:57.846
Lou: What? How could he just
leave at such an important time?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.647
Lily's back in rehab, Lou.

05:59.682 --> 06:02.784
Oh... I'm so sorry.

06:02.818 --> 06:05.753
Um... well, you know what?
I'm back now

06:05.788 --> 06:07.956
and I am gonna make
your wedding...

06:07.990 --> 06:11.559
my first priority.

06:11.594 --> 06:13.394
I'm gonna dig out my files so
we can go over possible venues

06:13.428 --> 06:15.296
first thing in the morning.

06:15.330 --> 06:16.798
I don't really wanna spend
my whole day

06:16.832 --> 06:18.265
looking at pictures
of other peoples' weddings.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.334
Well, don't worry, we won't.

06:20.369 --> 06:22.064
Because we're trying on
wedding dresses after lunch.

06:22.084 --> 06:24.116
Amy: (Laughs)

06:24.136 --> 06:26.240
Hey, Lou...

06:26.274 --> 06:28.575
Do you wanna tell me
what's really going on?

06:29.018 --> 06:31.712
With Peter - why he isn't here?

06:31.746 --> 06:34.615
I told you,
something came up at work.

06:34.649 --> 06:36.183
So is he gonna keep traveling
back and forth to Vancouver?

06:36.218 --> 06:39.352
That's where his job is.

06:39.387 --> 06:41.154
I know, but I thought that's
the whole reason you went,

06:41.188 --> 06:42.589
so that you could talk
about making changes.

06:42.624 --> 06:44.324
Lou: Yeah, we talked, Amy.

06:44.358 --> 06:46.803
We talked until we were
blue in the face.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.294
And?

06:48.329 --> 06:53.133
Lou: And I feel like we finally
have a plan moving forward.

06:53.167 --> 06:56.369
Amy: Well, that's great to hear.
What exactly does that mean?

06:56.404 --> 06:58.271
<i>Katie: Mommy! I can't
find my bunny.</i>

06:58.305 --> 07:00.340
I'll be right there, sweetie.

07:00.374 --> 07:02.626
I should probably go
get her in the bath.

07:07.123 --> 07:09.282
(Diners chatter)

07:09.316 --> 07:11.483
- Waitress: Hi!
- Tim: Hey! There's my girl.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.453
- Lou: Hey!
- Amy: Your girls, actually.

07:14.487 --> 07:16.522
Tim: Sorry, I just haven't
seen this one for a while.

07:16.557 --> 07:17.924
I was beginning to think
you weren't coming back.

07:17.958 --> 07:21.427
You were gonna trade your boots
for birkenstocks.

07:21.461 --> 07:23.729
Lou: Thank you for taking care of
the diner for me while I was gone.

07:23.764 --> 07:25.497
Tim: Well, I gotta be
honest with you, honey.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.865
It wasn't easy doing both,
you know,

07:26.899 --> 07:29.000
with my new rodeo school.

07:29.035 --> 07:31.002
Hey, I heard about that. That
sounds right up your alley.

07:31.037 --> 07:32.930
Tim: Yeah, I gotta tell
you all about it, but...

07:32.950 --> 07:34.506
I really have to run.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.696
Lou: Okay. So what do you
need to catch me up on here?

07:36.716 --> 07:37.943
Tim: Nothing!

07:37.977 --> 07:40.079
Oh, the sink, it's clogged.

07:40.113 --> 07:41.580
Did you call a plumber?

07:41.614 --> 07:43.615
Tim: That's a good idea.

07:43.649 --> 07:45.283
Oh, and the uh...
the walk-in freezer,

07:45.317 --> 07:47.154
it's on the fritz.
The fan or something like that.

07:47.174 --> 07:48.386
- Lou: Since when?
- Tim: A few days.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.455
- Lou: A few days?!
- Tim: Yeah.

07:50.489 --> 07:53.592
Uh... oh! And-and...
We uh... we lost a server.

07:53.626 --> 07:55.894
(Sighs) What did you do?

07:55.928 --> 07:57.996
Tim: Apparently some people can't
take constructive criticism.

07:58.030 --> 08:00.164
Gotta run. (Kisses girls)

08:00.199 --> 08:02.032
- Tim: Bye-bye.
- Lou: Nice to see you too, dad.

08:02.067 --> 08:06.337
(Door clunks)
This is... sticking.

08:06.371 --> 08:09.264
Amy: Well, looks like you've got a
few things to catch up on here.

08:09.284 --> 08:11.209
Later. First...

08:11.243 --> 08:13.877
we need to find a place
for you to get married.

08:13.912 --> 08:15.816
(Amy's phone rings) I... should
take this, Lou. It's Ty.

08:15.836 --> 08:16.746
Go ahead.

08:16.766 --> 08:19.240
(Phone beeps) Hey!

08:19.260 --> 08:20.317

08:20.351 --> 08:23.787
<i>Amy: Uh... no, I'm. I'm actually

Why didn't you tell me
you work for Bedford Oil?

08:47.245 --> 08:50.212
<i>Peter: We never talked about work.
And, by the way, um...</i>

08:50.247 --> 08:51.948
I don't actually, technically,
work for them.

08:51.982 --> 08:54.383
Um... I own Bedford.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.853
Lou: You own Bedford Oil.

08:56.887 --> 09:01.457
Yeah. I guess that makes me
the big bad wolf, right?

09:01.491 --> 09:04.434
Lou: Peter, you are a very
attractive man, okay?

09:04.454 --> 09:06.428
Very... very attractive,

09:06.463 --> 09:09.598
but you stand for things
that make my blood boil...

09:09.633 --> 09:12.053
Peter: I just thought it would
keep interesting, right? I mean...

09:12.073 --> 09:14.183
Lou: It could never work.

09:15.838 --> 09:17.540
(Kissing)

<i>Amy: All right, I'm back on it.</i>

09:30.386 --> 09:33.576

this wedding stuff seriously.

09:34.122 --> 09:35.611
You okay?

09:35.847 --> 09:38.626
Yeah. I'm fine. Um...

09:38.661 --> 09:41.305
You know, you still haven't
told me what decisions

09:41.325 --> 09:42.863
you and Peter made-

09:42.898 --> 09:45.466
Nice try. You are not
steering me off course here.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.735
We need to make a short list
of venues

09:47.769 --> 09:50.305
and start contacting them to ask
about availability, okay?

09:50.339 --> 09:52.574
I'm thinking
the higher end hotels,

09:52.608 --> 09:55.309
Westgate Mansion,
the polo club, obviously.

09:55.343 --> 09:58.727
But first, we need to talk about
the pros and cons of each one...

09:58.747 --> 10:00.181
Starting with seating capacity

10:00.215 --> 10:02.282
'cause I know you still don't
know how many people are coming,

10:02.317 --> 10:05.186
<i>which is okay, but we do need to
sort of narrow it down a little bit.</i>

10:05.220 --> 10:08.622
(Banging on trailer)
Tim: Get up! Hey!

10:08.656 --> 10:10.791
(Bangs on door,
door clicks open)

10:10.826 --> 10:12.859
<i>Sorry to wake you
at the crack of ten.</i>

10:12.893 --> 10:14.561
What do you want?

10:14.596 --> 10:17.358
I still need a horse
for my school.

10:17.378 --> 10:18.885
What does that
have to do with me?

10:18.905 --> 10:20.967
I want you to find it for me.

10:21.001 --> 10:22.936
Yeah, I have a full plate with
my so-called "silent" partner,

10:22.970 --> 10:24.605
so find your own horse.

10:24.639 --> 10:27.874
Tim: No, no, no. (Door
bangs open) I can't.

10:27.908 --> 10:29.675
See, I'm going outta town. I'm gonna
be gone for a couple of days.

10:29.710 --> 10:32.378
Then I got full classes
when I get back, so...

10:33.066 --> 10:35.007
Caleb: Well, it sounds to me...

10:35.027 --> 10:36.649
You're in a bit of a tight spot.

10:36.683 --> 10:39.288
Yeah. Yeah, I know, it's gonna cost me.
How much?

10:39.308 --> 10:42.882
Well, it depends on...

10:43.423 --> 10:45.858
How long it takes,
how many horses I have to see,

10:45.892 --> 10:47.493
how far I have to go...

10:47.527 --> 10:50.529
Tim: Okay, here's the deal.
Two grand.

10:50.564 --> 10:53.499
You can keep whatever
you don't spend.

10:54.129 --> 10:55.934
- Caleb: Three.
- Tim: Two.

10:55.969 --> 10:58.298
Caleb: Twenty-five.

10:58.931 --> 11:00.573
(Amused sigh) Two.

11:00.607 --> 11:03.142
This isn't really how
you're supposed to negotiate.

11:03.176 --> 11:05.443
That's 'cause we're not
negotiating, Caleb.

11:05.478 --> 11:08.046
This is a take it or leave it
sort of thing.

11:09.510 --> 11:11.496
(Sighs) Fine, I'll do it.

11:11.884 --> 11:13.208
Tim: Great.

11:14.563 --> 11:16.521
See, that's how you negotiate.

11:17.442 --> 11:19.491
(Laughs)

11:19.525 --> 11:22.527
Jack: Okay, I got that.
What's next?

11:22.561 --> 11:25.282
Georgie: Okay... now you need
to take the counterweight,

11:25.302 --> 11:26.665
- which is that.
- Jack: Yup.

11:26.699 --> 11:30.468
And you just slide it onto
the counterweight shaft.

11:30.503 --> 11:32.470
Okay. And you just need
to make sure...

11:32.505 --> 11:33.971
(weight thumps,
Jack groans in pain)

11:34.006 --> 11:37.641
That you tighten it!

11:37.676 --> 11:40.146
- Georgie: (Annoyed) Is it okay?
- Jack: Yeah, it landed on my baby toe,

11:40.166 --> 11:41.078
it's fine. (Screen door opens)

11:41.113 --> 11:42.914
Georgie: I meant the telescope.
(Screen door snaps shut)

11:42.948 --> 11:45.883
Yes, the telescope is fine.

11:45.918 --> 11:47.618
Lou: I just don't know how you
can completely rule it out.

11:47.652 --> 11:49.653
I mean, do you know
how lucky we are

11:49.688 --> 11:52.222
that the polo club is even
available at such short notice?

11:52.256 --> 11:54.312
Amy: Lou, come on. Do you really
think we wanna get married

11:54.332 --> 11:55.793
in some stuffy country club?

11:55.827 --> 11:59.567
Stuffy? Look, the polo club was
rated one of the top ten places

11:59.587 --> 12:01.181
to hold an event in alberta.

12:01.201 --> 12:02.670
Amy: Okay, says who?

12:02.690 --> 12:04.468
Lou: I don't remember.
Look, Amy,

12:04.502 --> 12:08.371
let's just put a hold on it
while we explore other options.

12:08.405 --> 12:11.025
Lou, can I just take a break from all
of this wedding stuff for a bit?

12:11.045 --> 12:13.251
Yes. Look,
I have some laundry to do,

12:13.271 --> 12:15.014
we'll get back at it over lunch.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.739
Hi, you two.

12:16.759 --> 12:18.723
Wow, looking good.

12:18.743 --> 12:21.784
(Chuckles dryly)

12:21.819 --> 12:24.186
It's going that well, is it?

12:24.220 --> 12:25.449
Amy: We've made just
about as much progress

12:25.469 --> 12:26.655
as it looks like you guys have.

12:26.689 --> 12:28.211
Jack: (Chuckles dryly)

12:29.525 --> 12:31.060
(Blanket rustles)

12:34.464 --> 12:36.198
(Pats blanket)

12:51.380 --> 12:54.415
(Birds chirp)

12:57.219 --> 12:58.820
(Nervous sigh)

12:58.840 --> 13:00.688
Peter...

13:00.722 --> 13:04.541
Lou Flemming, will you marry me?

13:04.561 --> 13:06.435
Peter!

13:07.130 --> 13:10.698
Not gonna answer? Literally, you know,
my legs are gonna go to sleep here.

13:10.732 --> 13:14.059
Yes! Yes, I will marry you.

13:15.537 --> 13:19.740
<i>(Birds chirp outside)</i>

13:24.779 --> 13:26.580
(Screen door creaks open)

13:26.615 --> 13:28.649
Amy: Caleb! Hello.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.683
Caleb:
I need you to do me a solid.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.185
- Amy: A solid?
- Caleb: A favour.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.021
Okay.

13:34.055 --> 13:36.663
Your dad asked me
to find him a horse.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.459
- Amy: What kind of horse?
- Caleb: It's for his rodeo school.

13:39.494 --> 13:42.262
It's gotta be gentle,
but a little bucky.

13:42.296 --> 13:44.097
I figure you've come across
a ton of those in your clinics.

13:44.132 --> 13:47.133
Yeah, except I usually
train them not to buck.

13:47.167 --> 13:49.569
Surely there must be one or two
that not even you could fix.

13:49.603 --> 13:51.579
Amy: Um...

13:51.599 --> 13:54.206
Actually, there was this one not
too long ago that came a long way,

13:54.241 --> 13:56.709
but he's still
a tough horse to ride.

13:56.744 --> 13:58.477
Caleb: That's great.
I mean, for us.

13:58.512 --> 14:00.046
Would your client sell him?

14:00.080 --> 14:01.313
I don't know.
She's got young kids

14:01.348 --> 14:03.590
so he's definitely ideal
for her.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.651
Call her. Tell her to meet us at
the rodeo grounds with the horse.

14:05.685 --> 14:07.253
Amy: What, like now?

14:07.287 --> 14:09.522
I don't have a lot
of spare time.

14:09.556 --> 14:11.395
Why are you finding this horse
in the first place?

14:11.415 --> 14:12.991
Shouldn't my dad be doing it?

14:13.026 --> 14:14.927
He's out of town
for a couple days.

14:14.961 --> 14:16.862
- Amy: Where is he?
- Caleb: I don't know.

14:16.896 --> 14:19.432
<i>Jack: I bet I do.</i>

14:19.466 --> 14:22.363
He's driving to Moose Jaw.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.874
Grandpa what is going on?

14:26.893 --> 14:28.894
Miranda's getting married.

14:28.928 --> 14:31.263
- Amy: What? When?
- Jack: Tonight.

14:31.297 --> 14:33.298
Looks like your dad's gone
to crash the wedding.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.855
Amy: Well, why would he do that?

14:34.875 --> 14:38.123
Jack: I don't know, but I'm gonna
stop him before he gets there.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.839
When did he leave?

14:39.873 --> 14:41.306
Caleb: Not sure, but it
couldn't have been that long.

14:41.341 --> 14:42.807
Amy: He already has
a good head start.

14:42.842 --> 14:44.409
Ah, Tim's a creature of habit.

14:44.443 --> 14:46.111
He always stops
at that greasy spoon

14:46.145 --> 14:47.846
just off the saskatchewan
border.

14:47.881 --> 14:51.116
The Plowman's Special,
that'll slow him down.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.485
Good luck. (Door closes)

14:53.519 --> 14:56.788
(Amy clucks her tongue,
people chatter)

14:56.822 --> 14:58.423
Caleb: You really think he'll buck?
He seems pretty calm.

14:58.457 --> 15:00.425
Amy: He gets pretty fired
up when you mount him

15:00.459 --> 15:03.060
and I'm curious to see how
he'll do with a flank strap.

15:03.095 --> 15:05.029
(Caleb's phone rings,
Caleb sighs heavily)

15:05.063 --> 15:07.198
I gotta take this.
(Phone beeps on)

15:07.232 --> 15:10.234
Hey, Jesse, what's up?
Now? No, no.

15:10.269 --> 15:13.318
I'm-I'm looking at a horse
for Tim Fleming.

15:15.899 --> 15:17.641
(Sighs) Okay. Yeah,
I'll be right there.

15:17.675 --> 15:20.311
- Amy: What?
- Caleb: I gotta go.

15:20.345 --> 15:22.914
Amy: Caleb, we just got here.
You can't take off.

15:22.948 --> 15:24.882
I asked my client to bring her
horse here at a moment's notice.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.525
Caleb: Can you get
started without me?

15:26.545 --> 15:28.386
Seriously?

15:28.420 --> 15:30.754
I'm sorry, Amy, Jesse needs my
opinions on some thoroughbreds.

15:30.789 --> 15:32.656
It shouldn't take long.

15:32.690 --> 15:35.084
I'm supposed to be planning
my wedding right now with Lou.

15:35.104 --> 15:38.128
Caleb: Then you owe me for getting
you out of it for an hour.

15:38.162 --> 15:40.685
- Amy: Just hurry up, okay.
- Caleb: Thanks, Amy.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.139
Lou: (Humming happily)

15:49.173 --> 15:52.242
(Kisses Georgie,
continues humming happily)

15:52.276 --> 15:53.896
Georgie: What is up with you?

15:53.916 --> 15:55.578
Believe it or not,

15:55.612 --> 15:58.481
I was able to put a hold
on the polo club.

15:58.515 --> 16:00.516
But I thought Amy said she didn't
wanna have her wedding there.

16:00.551 --> 16:02.585
Lou: Amy doesn't
know what she wants.

16:02.619 --> 16:04.253
Besides, at this late date,

16:04.287 --> 16:06.388
<i>it's amazing
it's even available.</i>

16:06.423 --> 16:09.191
Well, it just doesn't sound like
Ty and Amy's kind of place.

16:09.225 --> 16:11.060
Have you ever even been there?

16:11.094 --> 16:13.830
- Georgie: Well no, but...
- Lou: Okay, well...

16:13.864 --> 16:17.455
take a look... at this.

16:18.088 --> 16:20.102
<i>See how elegant it is?</i>

16:20.136 --> 16:23.585
<i>If I hadn't snapped up that date</i>
somebody else would have.

16:24.807 --> 16:27.151
Is planning a wedding
always this crazy?

16:27.171 --> 16:28.871
(Snorts softly)

16:30.313 --> 16:31.813
<i>Peter:
I want you to come with me.</i>

16:31.848 --> 16:33.615
- Lou: To Dubai?
- Peter: Yeah.

16:33.649 --> 16:35.584
Lou: But we're not
getting married until...

16:35.618 --> 16:37.819
Like it's months away.

16:37.854 --> 16:39.488
Well, I just think we have
to move that up a little bit.

16:39.522 --> 16:41.590
Uh... to when?

16:41.624 --> 16:44.559
Mm... I dunno, now?

16:44.594 --> 16:47.562
(Door slams shut) Lou?!

16:47.597 --> 16:49.263
Come on, honey!
I thought you understood!

16:49.298 --> 16:50.799
Of course
we have to move to Dubai.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.600
<i>Lou: don't talk to me!</i>

16:52.634 --> 16:54.521
(Sighs heavily)

16:56.494 --> 16:58.373
Dubai?

16:58.407 --> 17:01.421
I put a lot of work
into this place.

17:01.769 --> 17:04.345
I wonder what it'll be like
when I'm not here to run it.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.147
Look, honey,
you don't have to...

17:07.182 --> 17:10.584
Lou: No, I... I've
thought about it and...

17:10.895 --> 17:13.220
I can pull it together.

17:13.253 --> 17:16.490
I'm determined to make it work.

17:16.525 --> 17:21.238
You... are an amazing woman.

17:21.698 --> 17:23.275
I know.

17:24.365 --> 17:26.866
<i>Georgie: The polo
club's okay, I guess.</i>

17:27.580 --> 17:29.636
No, it's not.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.005
What?

17:32.040 --> 17:34.341
Lou: It doesn't feel
like Ty and Amy.

17:34.375 --> 17:35.775
- Georgie: Well, that's what I said.
- Lou: You were right.

17:35.809 --> 17:37.210
I'm not bringing
my 'a' game here.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.546
I can do better.

17:38.566 --> 17:40.648
Somewhere out there is the perfect
place to hold this wedding.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.448
It's classy, but not stuffy;

17:42.482 --> 17:45.552
contemporary,
but a hint of tradition.

17:45.586 --> 17:49.722
You know, laid back
but still has a pulse.

17:49.757 --> 17:51.424
Maybe you should
take a break, Lou.

17:51.458 --> 17:54.594
Oh no, no, no.
I am just getting started.

17:54.628 --> 17:56.480
(Keyboard keys clack)

17:56.500 --> 17:59.065
(Truck rumbles)

18:06.339 --> 18:08.312
What the hell?

18:10.434 --> 18:12.134
Oh...

18:14.081 --> 18:15.993
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

18:23.999 --> 18:26.959
(Door bangs shut)
Jack: How was lunch?

18:26.993 --> 18:29.127
What the hell are you doing?

18:29.161 --> 18:32.297
Jack: I came here to ask you
that very same question.

18:32.331 --> 18:35.001
I'm still worried about Shane,
all right?

18:37.336 --> 18:39.070
See, this is why
I didn't tell you I was going

18:39.105 --> 18:41.172
because I knew
you'd read into it.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.208
Jack: Read into it how?
Like maybe I'd think

18:43.242 --> 18:44.875
that the real reason
you're going to Moose Jaw

18:44.910 --> 18:47.011
is so you can screw up
Miranda's wedding?

18:47.045 --> 18:48.646
Tim: (Huffs) That's not true.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.315
Jack: Well, then what do you
plan on saying to her then?

18:51.349 --> 18:53.771
Tim: I don't-who-who says
I'm saying anything?

18:55.954 --> 18:58.222
Well, I have to say
congratulations.

18:58.256 --> 19:01.446
Well, that's a message you can
deliver through Western Union.

19:01.466 --> 19:03.794
Or I could send a text,

19:03.829 --> 19:05.395
like the rest of us
in the twenty-first century.

19:05.430 --> 19:07.164
But that's a little impersonal,
don't you think?

19:07.198 --> 19:10.934
You are not going
to wish her a good life,

19:10.968 --> 19:13.970
anymore than you're going
for Shane's sake.

19:14.005 --> 19:16.573
Now you tell me,
what's the real issue here?

19:16.608 --> 19:19.343
The real issue here, Jack,
is that I have a father-in-law

19:19.377 --> 19:23.179
who won't keep his nose
outta my business.

19:23.213 --> 19:26.529
Who I've had to deal with
for 30-years...

19:26.549 --> 19:29.478
<i>30-years of BS!</i>

19:29.887 --> 19:33.866
(Truck doors open,
Tim's door closes)

19:34.191 --> 19:37.378
(Engine knocks,
Jack blasts his horn)

19:38.545 --> 19:40.480
What?!

19:41.473 --> 19:43.819
It won't start.

19:46.176 --> 19:47.703
<i>(Truck door bangs shut)</i>

19:48.547 --> 19:50.358
(Tim's door bangs shut)

19:56.024 --> 19:57.228
(sighs)

19:57.317 --> 19:59.751
(Katie sighs)

20:00.355 --> 20:01.802
Lou: (Giggles) Mommy's
just trying to figure out

20:01.822 --> 20:05.124
what's the best plan for Amy
and Ty's wedding, sweetie.

20:05.158 --> 20:07.039
What's a plan, mommy?

20:09.462 --> 20:11.863
(Door snaps shut) Peter!

20:11.898 --> 20:14.265
Hey! There she is!

20:14.300 --> 20:18.718
Whoa! Oh! You okay?
Is the baby okay?

20:18.738 --> 20:19.592
Lou: Absolutely.

20:19.612 --> 20:22.340
Peter: I gotta make
sure that I am here when it does happen.

20:22.374 --> 20:25.411
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm not going back to Dubai.

20:25.431 --> 20:27.607
I'm gonna stay here,
make this home base.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.414
You're gonna work from here?

20:29.448 --> 20:31.382
Peter: Yeah.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.534
'Til the end
of the pregnancy anyway.

20:33.554 --> 20:35.353
Just until the pregnancy's over?

20:35.387 --> 20:37.058
Well, I...

20:37.078 --> 20:39.991
maybe I could stick around 'til we
send 'im to college or something.

20:40.025 --> 20:42.407
(Kissing and laughing)

20:42.866 --> 20:47.130
A plan is something that you're
supposed to see all the way through.

20:47.527 --> 20:50.901
When's daddy gonna come home?

20:54.315 --> 20:56.006
Lou: I don't know, sweetie...

20:57.975 --> 21:00.276
I don't know.

21:00.310 --> 21:02.237
(Birds chirp)

21:03.281 --> 21:05.181
Jack: One more time.
(Engine knocks)

21:05.216 --> 21:06.750
(Humming sound, ignition clicks)

21:06.784 --> 21:09.095
Tim: No, no, it's dead.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.622
Do you want me
to have a look at that?

21:11.656 --> 21:15.669
Jack: No. I know what it is.
(Hood clunks shut)

21:16.128 --> 21:18.027
It's the starter, it's been
giving me trouble lately.

21:18.062 --> 21:19.640
I guess it bit the dust.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.469
Tim: Okay, I'll-I'll
call you a tow truck.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.066
Just give me a lift back

21:23.100 --> 21:24.600
and I'll send someone out
to get it.

21:24.635 --> 21:26.870
Tim: I'm not going back
to Heartland, you are.

21:26.904 --> 21:29.239
Jack: Well, maybe I should
come with you to the wedding.

21:29.273 --> 21:31.040
Tim: (Laughs) The last
time you talked to Miranda

21:31.075 --> 21:33.309
you convinced her to leave me.

21:33.343 --> 21:37.861
Jack: Ah, see? See? I knew it!
This is about you.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.910
- You are not going to Moose Jaw.
- How're you gonna stop me, Jack?

21:40.930 --> 21:43.051
I don't know.

21:43.086 --> 21:44.654
(Struggling,
horn honks as they struggle)

21:44.688 --> 21:46.389
Tim: Hey! Hey! (Keys jingle)

21:46.423 --> 21:48.290
Hey! Hey!

21:48.324 --> 21:49.992
(Grunts) Hey! Give me! Hey!

21:53.997 --> 21:55.563
(Door slams shut)

21:55.598 --> 21:57.699
Are you...?

21:57.733 --> 22:00.735
Are you freaking kidding me?!

22:00.770 --> 22:04.082
Wha-? Why would you do that?!

22:04.873 --> 22:06.941
(Wind blows, birds chirp)

22:09.345 --> 22:11.680
- Caleb: How'd it go?
- Amy: Well, as far as I can tell,

22:11.714 --> 22:13.615
this horse seems pretty perfect
for what my dad needs.

22:13.649 --> 22:15.417
Caleb: You're a good boy.

22:15.451 --> 22:16.818
How much do you think
your client will sell him for?

22:16.852 --> 22:18.320
I don't know, maybe a thousand?

22:18.354 --> 22:19.954
Think they'll go
for seven fifty?

22:19.988 --> 22:21.289
The less I spend,
the more I make,

22:21.323 --> 22:23.829
and I could really use
the cash right now.

22:23.849 --> 22:25.259
Amy: Is everything going all
right with your business?

22:25.294 --> 22:27.261
Uh... yeah, yeah. Well, uh...

22:27.296 --> 22:28.963
Look, Jesse lives
by the old saying,

22:28.997 --> 22:30.331
you gotta spend money
to make money.

22:30.365 --> 22:32.360
Those thoroughbreds
we just looked at,

22:32.380 --> 22:34.135
fifty g's a head.

22:34.169 --> 22:36.304
Amy: Whoa! Why would you
need a horse like that?!

22:36.338 --> 22:38.806
Caleb: To cater to a
higher end customer.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.907
Amy: And you're sure you have the
cash to buy that kind of stock?

22:40.942 --> 22:44.044
Well, Jesse's willing
to lend it to me,

22:44.078 --> 22:45.679
but I'm already into him
for the initial loan,

22:45.714 --> 22:47.748
plus the cost of boarding
my horses.

22:47.782 --> 22:49.128
Amy: I thought you were
keeping them at Briar Ridge?

22:49.148 --> 22:50.684
I am. He charges me full rate.

22:50.704 --> 22:51.651
Amy: What?

22:51.671 --> 22:52.720
Caleb: Says his mother would kill him

22:52.754 --> 22:55.779
if he went around giving
the facilities out for free.

22:58.956 --> 23:00.961
Lou: Okay, I think I've got it.

23:00.995 --> 23:02.961
Found the perfect place?

23:02.981 --> 23:04.326
Lou: An arena.

23:04.346 --> 23:05.598
- Georgie: An arena?
- Lou: Yes!

23:05.632 --> 23:09.369
If we did it up... like this.

23:09.403 --> 23:12.638
Look at that. Isn't it gorgeous?

23:12.673 --> 23:14.607
What's going on here?
Why is this all packed up?

23:14.641 --> 23:16.542
I'm taking it back
to my teacher.

23:16.577 --> 23:18.745
But the eclipse is tonight.

23:18.779 --> 23:20.346
Well, it's too hard to set up.

23:20.381 --> 23:21.947
Lou: Well, you can't
just give up, Georgie.

23:21.982 --> 23:24.216
Look, I'll-I'll help you
do it, okay?

23:24.251 --> 23:26.018
Georgie: No, it's okay, Lou, I don't
feel like watching the eclipse anyways.

23:26.052 --> 23:28.120
Lou: That is crazy, Georgie.

23:28.154 --> 23:29.989
You have been talking about
this for weeks. We can do this.

23:30.023 --> 23:32.457
Georgie:
Can you stop doing that?

23:32.492 --> 23:34.426
- Lou: Doing what?
- Georgie: You're not listening to me.

23:34.460 --> 23:36.528
I don't wanna watch the eclipse
without Peter.

23:36.562 --> 23:39.431
Just like how Amy doesn't want
some big splashy arena wedding.

23:39.465 --> 23:41.233
Lou: Georgie!

23:41.268 --> 23:43.135
Georgie: 'Kay, well, I'm
sorry, but it's true.

23:43.169 --> 23:45.136
<i>Sometimes you make decisions
for people,</i>

23:45.170 --> 23:47.539
even when they already told you
it's not what they want.

23:47.573 --> 23:49.441
(Stomps upstairs)

23:52.845 --> 23:53.779
<i>Auctioneer: Five
twenty-five, now thirty!</i>

23:53.813 --> 23:55.714
I'm at the Hanley auction.

23:55.748 --> 23:57.716
Oh, Peter,
this house is so great!

23:57.750 --> 23:59.050
- Four thirty-five!
- Peter: W-what? Lou?

23:59.084 --> 24:00.385
What're you doing?
Are you bidding?

24:00.419 --> 24:01.852
Are you bidding right now?
Are you crazy?!

24:01.887 --> 24:04.022
Please, Peter,
I want this house.

24:04.056 --> 24:06.690
It's perfect. We can fix it up.

24:06.725 --> 24:09.060
Peter: Fix it up?! Fix it up?!
It's a tear-down!

24:09.094 --> 24:11.762
I just wish you would
at least talk to me

24:11.797 --> 24:14.558
before you made up your mind
about something so important.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.367
Oh... right.

24:16.402 --> 24:18.135
Like the way
you always talk to me

24:18.169 --> 24:19.824
before you make up your mind
about things.

24:19.844 --> 24:21.238
Don't do that. don't even...

24:21.272 --> 24:22.506
Don't mention, uh,
the house that you bought

24:22.541 --> 24:24.207
without talking to me first?

24:24.242 --> 24:25.943
Or the specialist
you sent Katie to

24:25.977 --> 24:27.678
just because some overrated
private school

24:27.712 --> 24:30.620
says that she needed it? A school
I didn't even think she needed

24:30.640 --> 24:31.415
Lou: No, no, no!

24:31.450 --> 24:32.450
- Peter: to go to in the first place.
- Lou: That is not fair, okay?

24:32.484 --> 24:34.384
I thought I was doing
what was best for Katie.

24:34.419 --> 24:36.086
Oh, and what about
what was best for Georgie,

24:36.120 --> 24:38.155
how you thought that
she should contact her aunt.

24:38.189 --> 24:39.756
- Lou: Stop it.
- Peter: You remember her aunt, right?

24:39.790 --> 24:41.624
- The one that called child services on us.
- Lou: Stop it!

24:41.659 --> 24:43.126
Peter: And said that we
were abusing our children?

24:43.161 --> 24:46.263
- Lou: Stop it! Just stop it!
- Peter: Do you remember that?

24:46.297 --> 24:49.132
(Sighs heavily,
snaps laptop lid shut)

24:52.798 --> 24:54.312
(Grass rustles)

24:59.117 --> 25:01.778
Tim: Help me look. You're the
idiot that threw them in here.

25:01.812 --> 25:06.015
Jack: I said I was sorry. I
don't know what came over me.

25:06.049 --> 25:07.283
But we're never gonna find them.

25:07.317 --> 25:09.452
I didn't even see
where they landed.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.854
Tim: Just help me look!

25:12.169 --> 25:14.090
I'm gonna be late
for the wedding.

25:14.124 --> 25:17.448
Come on, Tim, don't you think
this like an omen or something?

25:17.468 --> 25:19.095
- Tim: An omen?
- Jack: Yeah.

25:19.129 --> 25:21.330
Like maybe the universe
is saying

25:21.365 --> 25:24.265
that you shouldn't be going
to Miranda's wedding.

25:24.300 --> 25:27.189
The universe didn't throw
my keys in here.

25:27.209 --> 25:28.976
You did!

25:30.539 --> 25:32.541
Get over here and look.

25:33.133 --> 25:34.659
Jack: All right.

25:38.109 --> 25:40.115
(Truck rumbles)

25:46.122 --> 25:47.778
Caleb: Thanks, Amy. See
what your client says

25:47.798 --> 25:49.466
at seven-fifty, right?

25:49.486 --> 25:51.126
I'll give it a shot.

25:51.657 --> 25:55.504
Caleb, this partnership
with Jesse,

25:55.752 --> 25:57.953
you're getting in pretty deep.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.605
(Sighs) I'm a big boy, Amy.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.137
Amy: I know. It's just...

26:03.171 --> 26:06.440
There's no chance that you're
still seeing Cassandra, right?

26:07.338 --> 26:09.710
Caleb... Caleb!

26:10.342 --> 26:11.913
Oh my God, are you crazy?

26:11.947 --> 26:14.181
You're still hooking up with Jesse's
girlfriend behind his back?

26:14.215 --> 26:16.161
Well, we can't very well
be out in the open.

26:16.181 --> 26:17.451
Not now.

26:17.485 --> 26:19.462
This is all gonna blow up
in your face if he finds out.

26:19.482 --> 26:22.756
He won't, he won't find out.

26:22.790 --> 26:25.392
Look, I just want
what you and Ty have.

26:25.427 --> 26:26.927
Where the worst thing
in my love life

26:26.961 --> 26:29.095
is trying to sort out
wedding plans.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.997
You're not gonna have that
with Cassandra,

26:31.032 --> 26:33.746
especially not when
she's with Jesse.

26:33.932 --> 26:36.736
(Sighs) I know.
It's complicated though.

26:36.771 --> 26:38.672
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

26:38.706 --> 26:41.159
I'm not sure you're thinking
with your heart right now.

26:41.179 --> 26:43.610
Or your head for that matter.

26:44.338 --> 26:46.572
Just be careful, okay?

26:47.590 --> 26:49.605
(Door bangs shut, engine starts)

26:49.625 --> 26:52.051
(Door opens and closes)

26:52.988 --> 26:54.663
- Amy: Hey.
- Lou: Hey.

26:54.683 --> 26:55.929
I'm sorry I took off earlier.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.805
No. Uh... I'm the one
who should apologize.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.594
- Amy: For what?
- Lou: For pushing too hard

27:01.628 --> 27:04.162
and for trying to tell you
what's right for your wedding.

27:04.197 --> 27:06.331
No, Lou, you know
that's not true.

27:06.366 --> 27:09.234
It is true.
I mean, can you believe

27:09.268 --> 27:13.271
I was actually considering this for
your wedding venue? (Key clicks)

27:13.306 --> 27:15.540
- Amy: Hey, is that that...?
- Lou: Yeah, Hillsdale Valley Arena.

27:15.574 --> 27:17.909
I know, it's a stupid idea.

27:17.943 --> 27:20.250
Amy: No... it's not.

27:20.270 --> 27:22.079
I mean, I don't know that I
would do it up quite like this,

27:22.114 --> 27:24.849
<i>but this is pretty cool.</i>

27:24.884 --> 27:27.284
Maybe I could even ride Spartan
up to the altar.

27:27.319 --> 27:30.243
Lou:
So... you actually like this?

27:30.263 --> 27:32.924
Yeah. It's the best idea yet.

27:32.958 --> 27:34.810
You're not just saying this
to get me off your case?

27:34.830 --> 27:37.229
No, Lou.

27:38.030 --> 27:41.665
I admit, I'm not really into
this whole wedding prep stuff,

27:41.699 --> 27:45.370
but I love Ty,
and I can't wait to marry him.

27:45.390 --> 27:48.372
So I need you to keep doing your
whole... obsessive Lou thing

27:48.407 --> 27:50.241
so this wedding will happen.

27:50.275 --> 27:51.975
My whole obsessive Lou thing?

27:52.010 --> 27:53.829
I mean that in a good way.

27:53.849 --> 27:54.845
(Laughs)

27:54.879 --> 27:56.146
Come on, let's go look
at wedding dresses

27:56.180 --> 27:57.848
and get this over with, huh?

27:58.273 --> 28:00.083
That's the spirit.

28:01.066 --> 28:02.803
(Dress rustles)

28:04.321 --> 28:06.256
Amy: It's too... puffy.

28:06.290 --> 28:07.858
Lou: Amy, I picked this one out

28:07.892 --> 28:09.459
because you said the last one
was too fitted.

28:09.493 --> 28:10.660
- Amy: Well it was.
- Lou: Right.

28:10.694 --> 28:12.228
And the one before that
was too "busy,"

28:12.263 --> 28:14.564
and that one's too "Hollywood."

28:14.598 --> 28:17.700
Well, I don't know, Lou.
None of them look right.

28:17.734 --> 28:20.340
How can you tell? You haven't
tried anything on yet.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.082
You know, at this rate, you are
gonna be walking down the aisle

28:22.102 --> 28:23.323
in a pair of wranglers.

28:23.343 --> 28:25.374
That's not a bad idea.

28:25.408 --> 28:27.843
Okay, all right! Fine!
I'll try one on.

28:27.878 --> 28:30.112
Thank you.

28:30.146 --> 28:33.583
Amy: Ungh!
Lou: Care-honey, careful.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.688
(Sighs heavily,
thumps lightly on couch)

28:38.926 --> 28:40.823
(Sighs heavily, slaps thighs)

28:42.925 --> 28:46.595
(Dress rustles)

28:51.677 --> 28:53.327
(Sighs)

28:55.538 --> 28:58.773
<i>Lou:
I, Samantha Louise Flemming...</i>

28:58.808 --> 29:02.276
<i>Peter: I, Peter Walter
Morris, do take you...</i>

29:02.311 --> 29:06.912
To be my husband,
my constant friend and...

29:06.932 --> 29:08.750
my one true love.

29:09.303 --> 29:11.449
With this ring...

29:11.469 --> 29:14.322
I thee wed.

29:14.356 --> 29:17.766
<i>(Guests clap and cheer) Minister: Mr.
and Mrs. Peter Morris.</i>

29:19.528 --> 29:21.462
- Lou: Okay.
- Jack: Bye. (Light kiss)

29:23.999 --> 29:26.667
(Sleigh bells jingle)
Lou and Peter: Bye! Bye!

29:26.701 --> 29:27.935
(Guests cheer and shout)
Peter and Lou: Bye! Bye!

29:27.969 --> 29:29.786
(Sleigh bells jingle)

29:35.635 --> 29:37.720
(Exhales slowly)

29:41.108 --> 29:43.452
<i>(Dress skirt rustles)</i>

29:47.155 --> 29:49.624
Lou: (Gasps)
Amy: Oh, come on. It doesn't look that bad.

29:49.644 --> 29:51.890
Lou and Amy: (Laugh)

29:53.940 --> 29:56.163
You look beautiful.

29:56.197 --> 29:59.132
I still think
it's a little... puffy.

29:59.425 --> 30:02.235
Lou: Okay, we'll keep looking.

30:02.614 --> 30:04.162
But you have to help me here,
Amy.

30:04.182 --> 30:06.039
What... what is it
that you want?

30:06.639 --> 30:09.042
Amy: Honestly, Lou?

30:09.076 --> 30:11.086
I just wanna find a dress
that looks as good on me

30:11.106 --> 30:13.353
as yours did on you.

30:16.429 --> 30:18.918
Lou? What's wrong?

30:21.741 --> 30:23.242
(Sniffling) Um...

30:24.724 --> 30:27.307
It's me and Peter.
We um... (Crying)

30:29.441 --> 30:31.063
What's going on?

30:31.675 --> 30:33.965
It's over, Amy.

30:34.393 --> 30:36.635
What're you talking about?

30:37.348 --> 30:39.504
Peter and I, we've...

30:40.066 --> 30:42.708
We've decided to separate.

30:42.742 --> 30:44.076
(Crying)

30:44.980 --> 30:45.777
Hey...

30:47.814 --> 30:50.268
(Crying)

30:57.352 --> 30:59.292
(Lou sighs)

31:07.268 --> 31:10.401
<i>Lou: You weren't there!
You never are!</i>

31:10.421 --> 31:12.907
Because I have a job, Lou!
A real job!

31:12.927 --> 31:14.241
Lou: And I don't?!

31:14.275 --> 31:16.410
I'm just sitting around
eating chocolates all day?!

31:16.444 --> 31:18.022
- Peter: That is not what...
- Lou: Except - oh wait...

31:18.042 --> 31:19.513
I don't have time
to eat chocolates

31:19.547 --> 31:23.283
because I'm too busy raising
our daughter... and Georgie!

31:23.317 --> 31:25.118
And you're too busy going
to some stupid meeting

31:25.153 --> 31:28.214
about an oil well in Venezuela
or Trinidad

31:28.234 --> 31:30.969
to care about
what is going on here!

31:30.989 --> 31:32.912
Yeah, I'm too busy to care,
Lou. Right.

31:33.458 --> 31:34.791
So what the hell?
I'll just pack my bags

31:34.811 --> 31:36.930
and head back to Vancouver.
How's that?

31:36.964 --> 31:39.909
Lou: You may as well. You know,
it's your home away from home!

31:39.929 --> 31:41.668
You must be used to it by now!

31:41.702 --> 31:43.329
Peter: That's what this
is all about, right?!

31:43.349 --> 31:44.103
Lou: No!

31:44.123 --> 31:46.072
Peter: I screwed up over
there and you will never let it go.

31:46.106 --> 31:48.207
That's why you won't move
to Vancouver;

31:48.241 --> 31:50.576
that's why you're stuck here
clinging to your life at Heartland.

31:50.610 --> 31:53.152
Because you're terrified that Peter's
gonna screw everything up again!

31:53.172 --> 31:55.803
- Lou: That is not true!
- Peter: It is true!

32:00.732 --> 32:02.482
(Door opens and shuts)

32:04.020 --> 32:08.280
Sorry, I couldn't wait
for you... in there.

32:09.869 --> 32:12.064
What happened, Lou?

32:12.400 --> 32:15.011
I don't know, Amy.
Just more of the same.

32:15.031 --> 32:16.702
It's like...

32:16.967 --> 32:20.127
It's like our arguments
are on this constant loop.

32:20.351 --> 32:23.508
My life is here with the girls,

32:23.528 --> 32:27.479
his life... is wherever
his work takes him.

32:27.883 --> 32:31.483
How are we supposed to grow
as a couple?

32:32.281 --> 32:33.851
But you can... you can work out.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.182
I mean, it can't really be over.

32:36.202 --> 32:38.489
Lou: It is, Amy.

32:38.523 --> 32:42.269
It probably has been for...
some time now and...

32:43.361 --> 32:45.264
It's like we've been living
separate lives

32:45.284 --> 32:48.165
and chasing different dreams
and...

32:48.771 --> 32:51.701
It finally caught up to us.

32:52.159 --> 32:57.086
Peter and I, we...
we don't work anymore.

32:59.047 --> 33:01.178
We're broken, Amy.

33:01.801 --> 33:04.184
Amy: But you still love him.

33:06.256 --> 33:09.053
Lou: Of course I do.
Everywhere I look

33:09.073 --> 33:11.688
I'm reminded of our life
together.

33:12.396 --> 33:15.536
I... I don't know, Amy.

33:16.590 --> 33:19.780
I'm so mixed up. (Crying)

33:20.648 --> 33:24.034
Maybe we're making the biggest
mistake of our lives...

33:28.862 --> 33:30.472
Lou: (Sniffling)

33:30.506 --> 33:32.541
(Light kiss, sobs)

33:35.731 --> 33:38.250
(Grasses crunch underfoot)

33:41.365 --> 33:43.985
Tim: I just wanted to make
sure Miranda was happy.

33:44.019 --> 33:46.788
Jack: Well, you expect
me to believe that?

33:46.822 --> 33:49.375
Tim: I don't know
what you believe.

33:49.395 --> 33:53.332
Jack: I think you wanted
to measure up her new guy.

33:53.352 --> 33:56.998
No, it's not that. I already
know how great he is, so...

33:57.032 --> 33:59.268
Young, and good looking,
and successful...

33:59.288 --> 34:01.803
That's what's been eating
at you.

34:01.837 --> 34:05.699
No. No, it's not him. It's me.

34:10.154 --> 34:12.331
Why wasn't I good enough
for her?

34:12.351 --> 34:14.304
(Birds chirp, grasses rustle)

34:16.649 --> 34:18.652
I mean, I laid it on the line,

34:18.686 --> 34:21.083
said I was willing to give us
a chance, plain as day.

34:21.103 --> 34:23.123
She just walked away.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.071
Are you in love?

34:34.356 --> 34:36.469
No. No, I barely speak to her.

34:36.489 --> 34:38.772
I mean with Casey.

34:42.264 --> 34:45.317
I don't know... I could be.

34:47.793 --> 34:49.949
We laugh a lot,

34:50.512 --> 34:52.652
she's smart,

34:52.882 --> 34:54.820
and you've seen how she looks...

34:54.855 --> 34:57.890
Yeah, she's not bad
at keeping you in check either.

34:58.233 --> 35:00.493
Yeah, she's got a talent
for that.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.731
Okay. (Claps hands lightly)

35:05.766 --> 35:09.145
Now you know I don't like
to give advice...

35:12.657 --> 35:16.942
But I think you oughta focus on
where you and Casey are headed,

35:16.977 --> 35:22.182
instead of rehashing where you
and Miranda have already been.

35:22.715 --> 35:25.517
(Birds chirp, breeze blows)

35:29.750 --> 35:31.505
(Sucks on grass)

35:31.525 --> 35:33.820
(Door bursts open)

35:34.577 --> 35:36.394
Georgie: (Excitedly) He's back!
Peter's back!

35:36.428 --> 35:38.529
(Vehicle rumbles)

35:38.564 --> 35:41.672
- Georgie: Hi!
- Peter: Hey, hey, hey!

35:42.491 --> 35:45.036
Hey! (Groans dramatically)

35:45.071 --> 35:46.571
<i>Georgie:
I-I can't believe you're here!</i>

35:46.605 --> 35:48.227
<i>Lou said you were stuck
in Vancouver!</i>

35:48.247 --> 35:50.962
<i>Peter: How can I miss watching the
eclipse with my favourite girls?!</i>

35:50.982 --> 35:53.211
<i>(Baby cries)</i>

35:54.072 --> 35:56.113
<i>Lou: Hi, you.</i>

35:56.133 --> 36:00.551
Honey, look at our baby. (Kiss)

36:00.586 --> 36:02.789
Peter: There's only one charm on it,
but lots of room for expansion,

36:02.809 --> 36:04.142
just like our family.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.590
(Light kiss)

36:05.624 --> 36:07.425
<i>Lou: We don't want you to leave.</i>

36:07.459 --> 36:09.226
And, in fact,
we would really love it

36:09.260 --> 36:12.796
if you would consider staying
here with us and with Katie.

36:12.831 --> 36:14.331
Peter: Now only if
that's okay with you.

36:14.365 --> 36:15.866
<i>Lou: It has to be right for you.</i>

36:15.900 --> 36:17.868
- Georgie: Woo-hoo! Okay, okay!
- Peter: All right, hold it!

36:17.902 --> 36:19.236
- Georgie: I'll hold it, I'll hold it.
- Peter: Okay, I'll reel it in.

36:19.270 --> 36:21.638
- Georgie: Okay.
- Peter: Woo!

36:21.672 --> 36:23.982
- Georgie: Oh my God!
- Katie: Mama, they caught a fish!

36:24.002 --> 36:26.335
Lou: Yeah.
Georgie: (Laughing)

36:28.072 --> 36:30.313
<i>Georgie: Thanks for coming home, dad!
This is gonna be amazing!</i>

36:30.348 --> 36:32.582
<i>Peter:
Ah! I told you I'd be here.</i>

36:32.617 --> 36:34.044
I brought home a telescope
from school,

36:34.064 --> 36:35.585
but we couldn't set it up.

36:35.620 --> 36:36.986
Peter: What is it?
An equatorial mount?

36:37.020 --> 36:38.588
- Georgie: Yeah! Yeah.
- Peter: Ah, no problem.

36:38.623 --> 36:40.249
I've done tons of those.
Let's do it!

36:40.269 --> 36:42.324
Georgie: Okay!

36:42.359 --> 36:45.194
- Lou: Hi.
- Peter: Hey. Hi.

36:45.963 --> 36:48.047
(Light peck)

36:49.431 --> 36:52.100
Georgie: Ah! Now we get to watch
the eclipse, the whole family.

36:52.135 --> 36:54.358
Oh, I'm so excited you're back.
We're gonna have so much fun!

36:54.378 --> 36:57.195
C'mon, Katie, let's go!
Come on! (Laughing)

36:59.976 --> 37:01.309
Peter: Sorry for just
showing up like this.

37:01.343 --> 37:03.872
I... I probably should've
called here.

37:04.368 --> 37:06.247
It's okay.

37:06.282 --> 37:10.747
I've been... I've been thinking
a lot about you, about us.

37:12.013 --> 37:13.821
Yeah, me too.

37:13.855 --> 37:17.287
Honey, are...
Are we giving up too easy?

37:19.917 --> 37:21.862
I keep asking myself that.

37:22.610 --> 37:24.098
Lou: Maybe...

37:24.221 --> 37:27.398
Maybe we should be fighting
to make this work.

37:28.904 --> 37:33.407
Peter: We've been fighting
literally, you know, a lot,

37:34.325 --> 37:35.943
and it's...

37:35.977 --> 37:39.674
It's just, it's taken its toll,
Lou, you know.

37:40.977 --> 37:43.684
And as much as it hurts,
I think...

37:43.881 --> 37:46.386
I think we're making
the right decision.

37:46.748 --> 37:49.356
So why did you come back?

37:49.390 --> 37:51.320
Because I told Georgie I was gonna
watch the eclipse with her.

37:51.340 --> 37:53.305
I'm gonna be here
for the kids, Lou.

37:53.325 --> 37:55.082
That-that-that's not
gonna change.

37:55.102 --> 37:57.249
Everything is gonna change.

38:01.245 --> 38:03.292
How are we gonna tell them?

38:06.368 --> 38:08.725
Peter: I don't... I don't know.

38:13.193 --> 38:14.279
But let's...

38:14.545 --> 38:16.882
Let's not tell them tonight,
okay?

38:16.916 --> 38:20.055
Would that be all right?
Let's just have one more night.

38:36.516 --> 38:38.021
<i>Caleb: So what do you
wanna talk to me about?</i>

38:38.041 --> 38:39.200
Is this another lecture?

38:39.220 --> 38:42.091
No. I wanted to say I'm sorry.

38:43.307 --> 38:45.527
(Sighs heavily)
That horse deal fell through?

38:45.562 --> 38:49.699
No. I mean about Cassandra.
I should've never pried.

38:50.551 --> 38:51.968
It's just...

38:52.002 --> 38:54.403
I am lucky to have
what I have with Ty,

38:54.621 --> 38:58.107
and... I want you
to be happy as well.

38:58.141 --> 39:01.310
Then tell me your client's
gonna sell that horse to Tim.

39:01.344 --> 39:02.969
Well, I haven't heard back
from her yet,

39:02.989 --> 39:05.080
but I'm sure it'll all work out.

39:05.115 --> 39:08.049
Caleb: I hope so. I really
need the commission.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.685
Did you and Jesse buy one
of those expensive horses?

39:11.059 --> 39:13.788
(Sighs) Two. We bought two.

39:13.823 --> 39:15.857
(Diners chatter,
music plays quietly)

39:19.051 --> 39:21.229
(Grasses rustle underfoot)

39:25.868 --> 39:27.168
(Keys jingle and thunk)

39:31.373 --> 39:34.175
Jack:
Well, will you look at that!

39:34.209 --> 39:36.444
Oh... I found your keys
right here.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.946
(Keys clank)

39:42.751 --> 39:46.253
Tim: No, give me the keys.
I'm still ticked with you.

39:46.287 --> 39:47.721
Spent a whole afternoon
of my life...

39:47.756 --> 39:49.716
an afternoon
I will never get back...

39:49.736 --> 39:52.520
looking around in grass.

39:53.394 --> 39:58.327
Hey! You can still make
the wedding if you leave now.

40:00.268 --> 40:03.170
Nah. I think I'm gonna send
a congratulations text.

40:03.933 --> 40:06.005
That's a good call.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.021
Well, I have you to thank
for that decision.

40:10.411 --> 40:13.079
You got me to see
how Miranda sees it, you know?

40:13.113 --> 40:14.914
What it would be like to have...

40:14.948 --> 40:18.384
somebody always following
you around.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.721
Pathetic.

40:21.755 --> 40:24.564
(Keys clank)
Let's get you a tow.

40:24.584 --> 40:27.860
Jack: Ah, you know, that truck's
had a chance to cool down now,

40:27.895 --> 40:30.129
I think we oughta give it
another shot.

40:30.164 --> 40:32.598
Tim: I thought you said
your starter bit the dust.

40:32.632 --> 40:36.221
Jack: Oh yeah, but
it's a finicky thing.

40:36.357 --> 40:39.837
Tim: You and I both know that there's
nothing wrong with your truck, Jack.

40:39.857 --> 40:43.141
Jack: (Laughing)

40:43.585 --> 40:45.311
Tim: You're unbelievable.

40:45.345 --> 40:47.320
(Chuckling) Unbelievable.

40:50.583 --> 40:52.458
(Approaching footsteps)

40:54.222 --> 40:56.154
- Lou: Hey.
- Amy: Hey.

40:56.369 --> 40:58.256
They finally get that telescope
set up?

40:58.290 --> 41:01.482
Lou: Yup. Peter is really
good at that kind of thing.

41:03.380 --> 41:05.241
Are you okay?

41:06.382 --> 41:09.001
Lou: I'm pretty far from okay.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.387
Amy:
I told Ty what's going on...

41:14.973 --> 41:16.907
We both think that,
under the circumstances,

41:16.942 --> 41:18.723
it would be best
to postpone the wedding.

41:18.743 --> 41:20.311
Lou: No.

41:20.346 --> 41:22.447
Look, I appreciate
your concern, Amy,

41:22.481 --> 41:24.841
but I'm not gonna let you
put your future on hold

41:24.861 --> 41:27.705
because of this, okay?

41:27.725 --> 41:32.156
And besides, the whole family is gonna
need something to look forward to.

41:32.668 --> 41:35.525
Lou: (Sighs heavily)
Amy: You're sure?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.194
Lou: If you really wanna
help me get through this,

41:37.229 --> 41:41.917
then... help me
to believe in love again.

41:43.841 --> 41:45.466
Amy: Yeah.

41:46.599 --> 41:48.974
Guess we should probably
book that arena.

41:48.994 --> 41:51.207
Lou: Yes, we will.

41:51.774 --> 41:54.070
And it's gonna be perfect.

41:58.133 --> 41:59.582
<i>Peter: Yes, I think so...</i>

41:59.616 --> 42:02.911
<i>Okay, let me just adjust it
a bit more here.</i>

42:03.047 --> 42:05.609
- <i>Oh, there we go.</i>
- Georgie: Really?

42:05.629 --> 42:07.857
Peter: Yeah!
It's happening! It's happening!

42:07.892 --> 42:09.621
- Georgie: Oh my gosh!
- Peter: Come on up, honey. Take a look!

42:09.641 --> 42:11.011
- Georgie: Here. Here.
- Peter: Look.

42:11.031 --> 42:13.009
You can see the moon.
It looks like a big cookie

42:13.029 --> 42:15.267
being eaten by the sky.

42:15.287 --> 42:18.267
<i>Katie: Now I can't see anything.</i>

42:18.302 --> 42:20.704
Peter: Oh boy. Well, you're
closing the wrong eye.

42:20.724 --> 42:22.338
You gotta close the other eye.

42:22.372 --> 42:24.840
(Laughing) This eye.
There you go.

42:25.204 --> 42:27.176
