WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.681
The Sharrows have taken every last
negro from Massinger's farm.

00:02.789 --> 00:04.185
They claim them as their right

00:04.209 --> 00:06.015
in payment for Massinger's theft
of their tobacco.

00:06.039 --> 00:08.319
I want Master Massinger's land

00:08.399 --> 00:11.079
and you will be my secret partner in
the enterprise.

00:11.159 --> 00:12.594
The previous governor,

00:12.633 --> 00:14.328
sold the land to Master Massinger

00:14.375 --> 00:16.594
without the permission of the company.

00:16.759 --> 00:17.999
Yeardley knows that.

00:18.079 --> 00:23.719
I will not be owned, possessed,
confined or determined by wedlock.

00:23.799 --> 00:25.879
The more they seek to shame me...

00:26.919 --> 00:31.079
the more I refuse... to be tamed.

00:34.719 --> 00:39.159
I hope you will be kind to us,
Lady Yeardley.

00:56.199 --> 00:58.199
What are you doing, Jocelyn?

00:58.997 --> 01:01.999
I am imagining, that is all.

01:03.199 --> 01:05.040
It was most gracious of you, sir,

01:05.071 --> 01:07.416
to compensate the Sharrows
for their loss.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.342
And has it made you reflect upon
your own hardship, Jocelyn?

01:10.399 --> 01:14.985
I came all the way here to marry
a man of position, a man of promise.

01:15.999 --> 01:18.639
I've been robbed of my hopes
because my husband was killed

01:18.719 --> 01:21.735
by the giant louse who stole this
land from the company.

01:21.797 --> 01:23.319
Stole?

01:23.883 --> 01:27.389
You seem quite certain of that
accusation, Widow Castell?

01:27.494 --> 01:30.034
Well, Argyle sold this ground
to Massinger

01:30.058 --> 01:31.860
without the company's permission.

01:31.929 --> 01:33.689
That makes it illegal.

01:34.799 --> 01:36.296
Should the company be alerted to this,

01:36.320 --> 01:39.937
they will reclaim every acre
and none of it will come to you.

01:40.617 --> 01:42.666
Be careful, Jocelyn.

01:42.743 --> 01:45.916
Your politicking has, so far,
amused me, aided me.

01:45.986 --> 01:48.297
Do not make yourself giddy with
opportunity.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.398
I have written to my sister.

01:51.218 --> 01:53.223
A letter she will hold in safekeeping.

01:53.289 --> 01:56.000
Should anything happen to me, she
will pass it to the company.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.779
I ask you, sir, so that I do not
have to ask them,

02:00.834 --> 02:03.833
do you suppose it is all that I deserve,

02:04.060 --> 02:06.881
the widow to be granted a parcel of land

02:07.135 --> 02:09.583
in consideration for my sore loss?

02:09.667 --> 02:11.676
What kind of parcel of land?

02:15.441 --> 02:17.301
This kind.

03:02.691 --> 03:05.409
I was told by the Chickahominy...

03:06.267 --> 03:09.909
Silas Sharrow gives information
to the Pamunkey,

03:09.979 --> 03:11.526
secret information,

03:11.600 --> 03:15.360
- in return for their favours.
- Why would you say this to me?

03:15.733 --> 03:19.640
Because I suspect that you alone
will know if it is true.

03:19.710 --> 03:21.710
I dearly wish it not to be.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.146
You have your hawk's eye
fastened on the Sharrows.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.170
You are no defender of them.

03:27.872 --> 03:30.146
You will tell me how it is.

03:30.201 --> 03:32.739
It's gossip, sir.

03:32.763 --> 03:35.269
The Chickahominy know that the Sharrows
trade well with Opechancanough

03:35.293 --> 03:37.816
so they wish to cause conflict.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.760
Perhaps you misunderstood
what was said to you, sir.

03:43.478 --> 03:46.041
It's a dangerous occupation
to dabble in politics

03:46.080 --> 03:48.353
when mistakes might be made.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.548
It is a dangerous occupation

03:51.619 --> 03:55.603
to dabble in all manner of things
in Jamestown.

04:26.739 --> 04:29.926
It is the judgment and the pleasure

04:30.098 --> 04:33.145
of our governor to compensate the...

04:37.680 --> 04:40.068
to compensate the Widow Castell

04:40.130 --> 04:42.130
in recognition of her bereavement...

04:48.440 --> 04:51.797
by the granting of all lands that
belonged to Master Massinger.

04:52.464 --> 04:55.016
What?

04:59.880 --> 05:04.593
A woman give land and the birth of it
coming from the mouth...

05:04.694 --> 05:07.760
of the marshal hisself!

05:07.840 --> 05:10.829
You enjoy playing to the pack, Rutter.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.564
You shall play the violin.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.560
The neck violin.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.600
- No, Marshall, no not the shrew's fiddle.
- Assembly's concluded.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.640
Go back to work.

05:25.208 --> 05:28.492
How does the widow know about Argyle?

05:28.547 --> 05:29.547
Who could tell her?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.560
Who is it knows but we three?

05:33.360 --> 05:35.410
I might suspect you two,

05:35.981 --> 05:38.265
did you not cherish
your loathing of the widow

05:38.304 --> 05:40.217
as a miser adores a pearl.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.693
She has me... trapped in this matter.

05:45.786 --> 05:48.772
If I challenge her openly,
then the Virginia Company

05:48.796 --> 05:50.319
will be alerted to our land dealings.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.420
It burns my blood that every day,

05:52.693 --> 05:55.519
every week she grows
in strength and position.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.680
Then we must cut her down.

05:58.199 --> 06:00.777
You cut her down
with the skimmington, sir...

06:01.323 --> 06:03.323
but she struck back.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.916
You have made an enemy of the Governor.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.877
And he's made a foe of me.

06:20.916 --> 06:23.385
I know it was he who arranged
the people in the street

06:23.409 --> 06:25.016
to taunt and shame me.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.885
Please tread most carefully.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.042
I see how what
has been done to you by men

06:30.081 --> 06:32.456
makes this freedom
a kind of wonder to you.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.582
So... I will celebrate Widow
Castell's glittering self rule

06:40.224 --> 06:43.910
and I'll pursue you no longer,
dear Jocelyn.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.797
Alice, is Silas still giving favours
to the Pamunkey?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.760
No, that's ended. Why do you ask?

07:05.131 --> 07:08.000
As long as it's done with, that's
all that matters.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.840
I had such plans for Massinger's land.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.560
It's time we took more
territory from the naturals.

07:20.647 --> 07:22.253
You only have to wave your arm, sir,

07:22.277 --> 07:23.759
and I'll put together an attack force.

07:23.783 --> 07:25.987
Are you certain that the widow's gains

07:26.058 --> 07:28.737
give sufficient cause for us
to rile Opechancanough?

07:28.807 --> 07:31.320
Aggression will just bring
condemnation from the company.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.760
They insist on peace.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.374
You would prefer the Pamunkey
to be seen as the ones

07:36.398 --> 07:38.014
to violate the agreement, Governor?

07:38.072 --> 07:40.192
- So, we provoke 'em.
- Not quite.

07:40.592 --> 07:45.191
- What we mean to do is to...
- Falsify some assault upon us.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.200
But the result will be the same, sir.

07:49.441 --> 07:50.692
War.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.777
Caution does not become you, Farlow.

07:54.143 --> 07:57.387
Bring me a device that lays
all the blame on the Pamunkey.

08:05.880 --> 08:10.786
If I look this way
and then I look... that way...

08:11.262 --> 08:13.981
and then I look... another way...

08:16.280 --> 08:20.320
- that is all your land?
- It is.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.685
And them men?

08:23.262 --> 08:26.136
Tenured labourers, tied here to me
until their time is served.

08:26.247 --> 08:28.800
They ain't so very pleased
to see us, is they, ma'am?

08:30.325 --> 08:33.240
I will employ an overseer to serve
as master to them.

08:33.570 --> 08:35.200
I know just the man for it.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.567
Master Read?

08:58.906 --> 09:01.186
I would have you make me two swords.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.338
- I have some here.
- I want rapiers.

09:06.568 --> 09:10.528
What cause have you for two weapons
such as that... Doctor?

09:10.951 --> 09:14.791
There is... time enough for
explanations.

09:16.448 --> 09:18.448
Tell me what the cost will be.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.776
I'll make the rapiers, sir.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.160
Another jug of wine here!

09:38.520 --> 09:41.600
You've a fine thirst on you
tonight, Marshal.

09:43.820 --> 09:45.828
Since you women arrived,

09:45.985 --> 09:47.985
I have plentiful cause to drink.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.240
Ain't this the same man who took a
whip to James Read's back?

10:57.935 --> 11:01.919
Ain't this the same dog
nailed your ear to a post?

11:02.701 --> 11:04.520
This the same...

11:04.756 --> 11:06.732
dung beetle...

11:07.013 --> 11:10.474
locked me in the stocks
and poured pig shite over my head?

11:12.490 --> 11:16.040
- Now we have him.
- There's an old mariner's trick.

11:16.229 --> 11:18.189
Point my percy at him.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.599
When he wakes, he'll believe his own
bladder's shamed him.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.360
I don't suppose I will ever have
such an opportunity again.

12:02.510 --> 12:05.824
Do you need some aid, Marshal?
Shall I fetch the Governor?

12:05.878 --> 12:08.849
Whenever my husband is leaky, sir,

12:08.897 --> 12:12.302
I tell him he's not only
disgraced his breeches,

12:12.373 --> 12:14.932
he has disgraced his name.

12:17.151 --> 12:21.074
If you ever... whisper one word of this,

12:21.152 --> 12:25.086
the pair of you will hate
every miserable breath you take.

12:26.243 --> 12:29.585
The pissed breech walk
in't so very noble.

12:30.656 --> 12:32.656
I know such things.

12:58.438 --> 12:59.838
A fire.

13:00.583 --> 13:05.258
The whole of the widow's harvest
will be lost in flames.

13:05.348 --> 13:07.487
But would that not be a waste of profit?

13:07.565 --> 13:08.909
Her profit.

13:08.972 --> 13:10.892
No, Virginia's profit.

13:11.932 --> 13:15.532
- And can it be done?
- The business will be conducted at night

13:15.612 --> 13:16.981
so all that will be witnessed

13:17.035 --> 13:21.126
is dark figures carrying torches
as the Pamunkey do.

13:21.173 --> 13:23.892
Sir, the widow's new gains
will be ruined

13:23.939 --> 13:27.428
and you'll have good cause
to strike at the naturals

13:27.538 --> 13:31.179
and take land from them,
two enemies, one blow.

13:31.739 --> 13:33.359
A blaze.

13:33.711 --> 13:35.537
What a splendid spectacle

13:35.577 --> 13:38.349
to welcome the widow
into the world of being a landlord.

13:53.252 --> 13:56.124
You have negroes on your farm now?

13:57.688 --> 14:00.303
Yes, yes we do.

14:01.772 --> 14:03.772
Will they have a brand on them?

14:05.506 --> 14:08.272
They will serve their term
as tenured men do

14:08.404 --> 14:10.089
then they will be free men.

14:11.271 --> 14:16.121
Is that a promise or an English promise?

14:19.129 --> 14:21.329
I don't blame you for doubting us, Maria.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.666
Us settlers ain't always done God's work.

14:39.332 --> 14:40.972
The Governor marked me.

14:42.412 --> 14:46.531
Now every day that I am here,
I will try to mark him.

14:47.148 --> 14:49.953
I heard the Governor speaking.

14:50.344 --> 14:52.758
He wants some trouble.

14:53.437 --> 14:57.718
- To blame the naturals for it.
- Who was he talking to?

14:57.781 --> 15:00.372
Did he say what kind of trouble?
Did he mention when it would be?

15:00.414 --> 15:02.718
Night. He wants night.

15:02.773 --> 15:05.421
Maria, are we ready to go now?

15:06.257 --> 15:08.458
No, ma'am.

15:09.122 --> 15:11.466
We are not ready to go now.

15:12.852 --> 15:15.208
Maria has suffered enough, Alice.

15:15.701 --> 15:18.012
I do not wish her to be hurt any more.

15:25.899 --> 15:29.189
Our governor wants to seize
more ground from the naturals.

15:29.234 --> 15:30.623
What will we do?

15:30.649 --> 15:32.732
Do you think I can go back to
Chacrow with this news?

15:32.812 --> 15:36.927
Alice, in't that brought enough worry
to us with that spying business?

15:36.989 --> 15:40.292
The very piece of earth
you live on was once Pamunkey.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.332
What will you do?

15:42.412 --> 15:44.372
Give it back to them?

15:46.012 --> 15:50.612
In't it time you bent your righteousness
to the world we live in now?

15:51.852 --> 15:56.252
You have your own land.
I don't want you on our farm.

15:56.332 --> 15:58.292
Do you hear me?

16:07.812 --> 16:10.532
Will you work as my overseer,
Master Read?

16:11.612 --> 16:14.885
The Governor said that you must marry...

16:17.322 --> 16:20.492
but here you are unwed with
your own farm.

16:21.041 --> 16:25.753
You've proven yourself a gentlewoman
can master any man.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.163
Is that your answer?

16:28.234 --> 16:30.170
A bolder man would not be intimidated

16:30.224 --> 16:32.278
by the prospect of working for a woman.

16:34.652 --> 16:37.653
Now I've offended your delicate mettle.

16:37.972 --> 16:39.692
I wonder if you might weep.

16:40.052 --> 16:43.492
I cannot bear it when a man sobs and
whimpers.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.961
I promise you,

16:52.804 --> 16:55.406
you will never see me weep again.

16:55.461 --> 16:57.187
If that's what your cold heart prefers...

16:57.226 --> 16:59.271
I would prefer that you
take up the position

16:59.295 --> 17:01.295
so that you might prove me wrong.

17:01.934 --> 17:04.192
Suppose I've no need to prove you wrong?

17:06.732 --> 17:09.132
Suppose I already know that
you're wrong.

17:15.652 --> 17:18.498
Sometimes I will say anything to get
what I want.

17:20.053 --> 17:22.053
I need you.

17:24.349 --> 17:26.349
No, you don't.

17:30.495 --> 17:32.495
You don't need anyone.

17:34.769 --> 17:36.769
Perhaps that's your curse.

17:41.547 --> 17:43.727
It is what I was told.

17:43.782 --> 17:46.985
They want to make it seem like
Pamunkey have made an attack.

17:47.074 --> 17:49.034
Why is Silas not here?

17:50.289 --> 17:51.993
You were kind to me, Chacrow.

17:52.055 --> 17:55.914
To hear of such a wrong...
I wanted to tell you.

17:56.312 --> 17:59.125
Does Silas know of Yeardley's plans?

18:01.144 --> 18:03.144
He does not want to help us.

18:04.694 --> 18:07.008
Silas is a true friend.

18:07.064 --> 18:10.603
But he would be killed if the Governor
thought he was talking to you.

18:10.658 --> 18:14.220
Will you not be killed as a traitor?

18:15.092 --> 18:17.092
No one will ever know.

18:17.172 --> 18:21.932
Winganuske knows. Her first loyalty
is to her husband.

18:23.384 --> 18:27.476
Your first loyalty is also
to your husband.

19:38.372 --> 19:40.372
You're a Sharrow now.

19:42.972 --> 19:44.972
That's all that matters.

20:15.612 --> 20:17.292
The other one is yours.

20:18.772 --> 20:23.172
I'm a proven swordsman, Dr Priestly,
you're not.

20:23.252 --> 20:25.212
Ridgewater at dusk.

20:25.292 --> 20:30.076
You're a kind apothecary who has
helped me many a time.

20:31.873 --> 20:34.388
I issue this challenge between we two

20:34.435 --> 20:36.435
because you have made a mockery of me.

20:36.492 --> 20:37.662
If you do not accept it,

20:37.716 --> 20:39.686
then I must repeat it
before the whole assembly.

20:39.732 --> 20:42.852
Then you'll be marked out as a
coward for the rest of your life

20:42.932 --> 20:44.743
and the reason for my bid against you

20:44.797 --> 20:47.561
will be whispered
on every lip in Jamestown.

20:48.532 --> 20:51.092
- Sir, let me tell you...
- No, let me tell you.

20:52.676 --> 20:54.676
You are a blacksmith.

20:56.003 --> 20:59.012
You have stubbed your filthy fingers
onto my good name.

20:59.809 --> 21:01.661
Why?

21:01.966 --> 21:05.126
Because you saw fit not to give a
blink to my heart...

21:06.044 --> 21:10.572
my reputation,
my true and honourable intention.

21:14.012 --> 21:16.012
I will wait for you at Ridgewater.

21:16.669 --> 21:19.389
No more words will pass
between us till then.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.346
I spoke with the Chickahominy up river

21:32.409 --> 21:34.409
and they refused to do the burning for us

21:34.443 --> 21:36.573
but I traded muskets for arrows,

21:36.604 --> 21:37.752
bows and torches,

21:37.815 --> 21:40.322
enough for the blame
to land on the Pamunkey.

21:40.372 --> 21:43.412
We move by dark
and we get the deed done.

21:43.492 --> 21:46.384
It seems a great pity
to waste good crops.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.329
Is there no other way for us
to make trouble with the Pamunkey?

21:48.353 --> 21:50.250
No, no, it must be the widow.

21:50.579 --> 21:54.064
I wanna be there to see that witch's
face when her land burns.

21:54.127 --> 21:56.471
That picture will be moulded
into my memory.

21:56.510 --> 21:59.104
It helps to not gloat, sir,
you'll be heard.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.572
What is the matter with Rutter?

22:03.652 --> 22:05.972
I should have put his head on a
spike years ago.

22:06.052 --> 22:08.216
Gentle sirs,

22:08.442 --> 22:11.629
my wife tells me that
when I am asleep with the drink,

22:11.676 --> 22:15.311
I play a tune the night long with my
second mouth.

22:15.405 --> 22:20.052
- Cracked cheeks, words of wind.
- Away with you, you drayman stool.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.270
Marshal Redwick,
we have a question for you.

22:22.309 --> 22:25.619
Now, we Rutters are forbid
from trading with the mariners...

22:25.666 --> 22:29.940
Might you consider, Marshal,
out of the kindness of your kind heart...

22:29.995 --> 22:31.995
Did you not hear me? Get away.

22:32.052 --> 22:35.842
Ooh, forgive me hopping thither and
thither, sirs.

22:35.881 --> 22:38.612
There are times when my bladder
in't my friend.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.534
Did ever any man have such a...

22:41.635 --> 22:45.143
pissed breeches,
leaking tail as my lover...

22:45.168 --> 22:47.468
- You can trade, Rutter. You can trade.
- Thomas, what is the matter?

22:47.492 --> 22:49.256
Just do not look at me more.

22:49.311 --> 22:52.349
Do you hear me, Rutter?
Don't look at me!

23:14.378 --> 23:18.625
Here... why didn't you ask him to
take off the shrew's fiddle?

23:18.788 --> 23:21.234
Aw, I forgot!

23:26.264 --> 23:28.123
Alice?

23:36.991 --> 23:38.991
I spoke with Henry.

23:40.047 --> 23:42.864
It was wrong of me to ask you to
live so close by my brother.

23:45.246 --> 23:46.486
He raped you.

23:48.342 --> 23:52.022
Now, he might say that he had claim
on you as his wife but...

23:53.127 --> 23:55.361
he now knows that he must work
his own farm.

23:55.533 --> 23:57.493
He's to leave us be.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.486
Thank you.

24:11.566 --> 24:13.566
It's as you said...

24:16.529 --> 24:18.529
I do not trust our governor.

24:18.766 --> 24:21.783
But James Read warned me that the
doctor has heard rumours

24:21.808 --> 24:23.792
that I've been in confederation
with the Pamunkey.

24:23.886 --> 24:25.846
So we must tread carefully.

24:25.926 --> 24:31.206
Silas... I went to speak with
Chacrow to warn him.

24:33.526 --> 24:34.966
Why would you do such a thing?

24:35.046 --> 24:39.527
I... I felt so ashamed that we were
to do nothing.

24:39.574 --> 24:43.106
I felt as though I was
to blame for Maria's branding.

24:43.167 --> 24:46.027
I had to act or my soul would burst.

24:47.974 --> 24:51.107
That is something to love, I suppose.

24:51.162 --> 24:53.919
To have a woman fierce with honour.

24:53.966 --> 24:55.926
What will come of it?

24:57.566 --> 24:59.566
Well, we shall see.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.206
Stop that.

25:10.286 --> 25:13.200
All swine satches on herring shotten.

25:15.086 --> 25:17.086
I don't understand a word he said.

25:17.419 --> 25:20.926
Ma'am, he said he had minded
to do the bidding of a woman.

25:21.013 --> 25:23.493
- How do you know what he spoke?
- I can't say how I know.

25:23.566 --> 25:27.246
I just hear the jumble and then it
unjumbles in my head like pastry.

25:27.333 --> 25:31.499
A near leggest headstring... of a
sheep's leather.

25:31.545 --> 25:33.577
You will work, do you hear me?

25:33.632 --> 25:36.856
You will labour for me as hard
as you did for foul Massinger.

25:36.894 --> 25:42.247
Spepper spabens benorm with a bots.
Massinger half cheeked.

25:42.286 --> 25:44.919
Ma'am, he said he respects
Master Massinger's whip

25:44.966 --> 25:46.966
more than he do a skirt captain.

25:47.126 --> 25:48.865
Why does he speak that way?

25:48.951 --> 25:51.412
Some say it's so many beatings
that done it.

25:52.201 --> 25:54.734
Some say it's because
he eats river plants and...

25:55.312 --> 25:57.926
some say he was born
with the wrong words.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.886
Fight with me.

26:16.246 --> 26:18.246
Coward.

26:33.338 --> 26:34.956
Again.

26:42.915 --> 26:44.393
Again!

26:57.266 --> 26:59.192
Again!

27:17.886 --> 27:19.886
Again.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.166
Again, damn you!

27:29.677 --> 27:31.717
On my hand sig.

27:33.427 --> 27:36.507
Set to a leg! Set to a leg!

27:42.728 --> 27:44.455
I am no farmer,

27:44.706 --> 27:48.682
but this will be the
best plantation in all of Virginia.

27:48.726 --> 27:52.085
Any man who doubts that does not
know me well enough yet.

27:52.966 --> 27:55.780
You will labour not because
you are whipped.

27:55.904 --> 27:58.449
You will labour because
you will be rewarded.

28:01.846 --> 28:05.834
What man wants one year taken from
the time of his tenure here?

28:07.846 --> 28:10.717
- Then work like it's a joy.
- Aye, miss.

28:10.802 --> 28:12.761
We have a harvest must be brought in.

28:39.606 --> 28:42.088
I will never be set free...

28:43.325 --> 28:45.307
will I, Lady Yeardley?

28:46.566 --> 28:49.686
When the Governor bought me, he did
not intend to let me go...

28:50.266 --> 28:55.506
to... be a man with my own land,
like the English...

28:57.016 --> 28:58.723
did he, Lady Yeardley?

29:01.624 --> 29:03.819
Every time I spoke to him

29:03.921 --> 29:06.710
about my hopes,
he did not give me the answer

29:06.772 --> 29:09.861
because he wanted Pedro
to be a believing fool.

29:09.926 --> 29:13.042
My husband wished
to show you all of his kindness

29:13.073 --> 29:15.104
so that you might be glad to remain here.

29:15.166 --> 29:20.323
I have seen all of the Governor's
kindnesses now.

29:22.632 --> 29:27.032
I have seen all of England's kindnesses.

29:30.446 --> 29:32.206
I have seen your kindnesses.

29:32.286 --> 29:34.809
I plead with you, Pedro,

29:34.873 --> 29:37.833
do not attempt to defy my husband.

29:37.887 --> 29:40.885
He will tear your heart out with his
teeth.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.192
I have a toothache.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.324
Let me take a look.

30:14.206 --> 30:16.206
Yes. I see.

30:17.846 --> 30:19.446
Most worrisome.

30:27.606 --> 30:31.606
- Christopher, you do tease me so.
- You think I tease?

30:33.727 --> 30:35.867
Stop it.

30:35.953 --> 30:37.450
I was fooling.

30:37.497 --> 30:40.661
I only wanted to feel your fingers
upon me, just for a little while.

30:44.246 --> 30:48.280
In England, blacksmiths were
employed to extract teeth.

30:48.951 --> 30:51.170
They have the body strength that is
needed to pull them out.

30:51.194 --> 30:54.154
I would not let the blacksmith lay
his hands upon me.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.227
Do you mean that he might not lay
his hands upon you any more?

30:59.334 --> 31:02.866
Good. That is good.

31:02.907 --> 31:05.160
Christopher, what are you implying?

31:05.222 --> 31:06.921
It puzzled me

31:06.968 --> 31:11.014
why the Governor was
so insistent that I should marry you

31:11.443 --> 31:14.848
but I chose to hide my eyes
behind my fingers

31:14.910 --> 31:19.390
because I wanted to see only the
opportunity to take you to my bed.

31:19.627 --> 31:22.977
To wake beside you, to spend every day

31:23.023 --> 31:25.852
- in your glistening orbit...
- Stop it. Speak no more.

31:25.907 --> 31:27.507
But I will.

31:27.587 --> 31:30.471
Yeardley made sure the blacksmith heard

31:30.533 --> 31:32.385
when he pressed me to marry you.

31:33.547 --> 31:39.027
- And it made me see what I already...
- Speak no more, I say.

31:40.427 --> 31:43.867
It is a falsehood. A cruel calumny.

31:43.947 --> 31:46.294
In your own thinking,
Jocelyn, it might be

31:46.348 --> 31:48.162
whatever you choose it to be.

31:48.746 --> 31:51.147
But here...

31:51.981 --> 31:53.027
now...

31:53.724 --> 31:56.130
between you and I,

31:56.427 --> 31:58.841
you will hear me say how it is.

32:01.307 --> 32:03.938
I would marry you still.

32:09.912 --> 32:13.067
Let that be your memory
of how I love you.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.271
What are you going to do?

32:36.877 --> 32:38.877
Damn you.

32:39.841 --> 32:41.841
We will fight.

33:01.334 --> 33:03.334
Pick up the weapon.

33:07.307 --> 33:09.031
Fight.

33:10.728 --> 33:12.728
I will have my honour.

33:30.867 --> 33:32.504
You have your honour.

33:33.809 --> 33:37.590
You are the only man
in Jamestown who does.

34:15.069 --> 34:17.885
That is Master Massinger's farm.

34:18.661 --> 34:22.268
No, it's my farm.

34:38.867 --> 34:41.857
We must fetch water from the river.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.601
We have to stop it from spreading.
Come on. Come on.

35:09.995 --> 35:16.049
Mistress Castell, it seems the fire
was started deliberately.

35:16.715 --> 35:20.424
I found these amongst the trees.

35:26.355 --> 35:29.176
There's the tale of it. Pamunkey.

35:29.230 --> 35:31.235
Governor, I would speak with you.

35:31.315 --> 35:33.995
Silas Sharrow has been plotting
with the Pamunkey.

35:34.042 --> 35:35.450
What are they saying?

35:35.503 --> 35:38.875
And what's going on? Something's wrong.

35:38.955 --> 35:41.875
Silas Sharrow.

35:41.955 --> 35:43.196
They'll blame you for this.

35:43.242 --> 35:46.312
They know you aided the naturals. Go. Go.

35:46.359 --> 35:49.195
- Go.
- After them!

35:49.275 --> 35:51.561
- Come on! Hurry up!
- After them!

35:58.555 --> 36:01.056
Sharrow, give yourself up!

36:01.115 --> 36:03.853
We know you aided our enemy.

36:03.931 --> 36:07.818
They attacked us because you warned
them we would take land.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.125
It's me that they want.

36:09.195 --> 36:12.624
You give yourself up
and I'll shoot you in the back myself.

36:27.787 --> 36:31.402
We're all in one spot, if they move
around, they'll have us penned in.

36:31.465 --> 36:34.835
- We'll go into the field, then.
- Pepper!

36:41.275 --> 36:44.315
Henry, they know me as a traitor.

36:44.395 --> 36:48.475
Suppose we kill them all today,
what life do we have left?

36:52.365 --> 36:56.150
We fight 'em until there's no
fighting left.

37:12.835 --> 37:15.795
They have us surrounded.

37:15.955 --> 37:17.859
Retreat!

37:45.107 --> 37:48.075
Henry, I will tell them that you are
no part in this.

37:48.155 --> 37:50.351
What is the point in you losing

37:50.406 --> 37:52.780
all that you've worked for
because of my crime?

37:53.733 --> 37:55.730
You're my brother.

37:56.129 --> 37:59.145
Silas, I have the horses back here.

37:59.195 --> 38:02.250
Go on, brother, ride to the Pamunkey.

38:02.275 --> 38:04.031
Ask Opechancanough to give you shelter.

38:04.191 --> 38:05.906
Silas, please.

38:08.646 --> 38:11.030
I can't keep 'em away much longer.

38:30.235 --> 38:33.389
If I go, I can't come back.

38:43.355 --> 38:45.542
They'll be here soon. You must go.

38:53.027 --> 38:54.947
I'm sorry it's come to this, Alice.

39:28.846 --> 39:31.059
Don't go lifting up
your hopes yet, Alice.

39:31.686 --> 39:33.646
I still ain't ready to die.

41:39.562 --> 41:41.131
Any man here

41:41.280 --> 41:44.107
dare say that I aided the Pamunkey

41:44.255 --> 41:47.013
is a fool and a liar.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.555
Who will stand before me and claim it?

41:50.635 --> 41:52.875
The charge is against
your brother, Sharrow.

41:52.955 --> 41:55.424
Well, Silas isn't here
to answer these accusations.

41:55.479 --> 41:57.479
There lies the proof of his guilt.

41:57.675 --> 42:00.798
Will you denounce your brother before
us all as a turncoat,

42:00.846 --> 42:02.527
Judas, snake?

42:02.613 --> 42:06.433
Why should I debate it
when that is what he is?

42:06.472 --> 42:09.715
And will you, yourself return him to
Jamestown to face judgment?

42:11.905 --> 42:15.115
Will you go to the Pamunkey and tell
Opechancanough

42:15.195 --> 42:17.796
that he must give up the deserter

42:18.006 --> 42:21.350
in order to show
your loyalty to the Crown?

42:22.157 --> 42:25.653
- I will.
- Why would he ever return?

42:28.180 --> 42:30.780
The Sharrow name,
it don't amount to much...

42:32.395 --> 42:34.190
but it will...

42:34.643 --> 42:39.049
if I can make it a name
that can never be spit upon.

42:41.032 --> 42:43.152
Return your brother.

42:52.035 --> 42:53.816
Henry?

42:56.715 --> 42:58.915
Why would you do this to your brother?

42:59.141 --> 43:01.196
I will take you to Silas,

43:01.282 --> 43:03.613
then you can decide
whose life it is you wanna live.

43:03.638 --> 43:06.238
There with him or here.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.002
Pedro, here I find you.

43:25.213 --> 43:27.595
Labouring before your wound
has even healed.

43:27.675 --> 43:31.326
How else can I show my respect and
devotion to my master?

43:34.675 --> 43:38.057
I will serve you, sir,
until I lose all my teeth.

43:39.186 --> 43:41.186
I have great plans for you, Pedro.

45:20.715 --> 45:22.418
Silas.

45:24.401 --> 45:28.058
I've come here to be with you.
I will live here.

45:33.097 --> 45:34.605
You cannot.

45:36.816 --> 45:39.044
It will be no kind of
life for a woman like you.

45:40.215 --> 45:43.635
Winganuske has made a home with us
settlers. I can do the same.

45:44.705 --> 45:46.361
Silas?

45:46.838 --> 45:49.511
I will not let you bring
my son up in this world.

45:49.550 --> 45:51.520
That is not why I came to Virginia.

45:56.235 --> 45:59.051
Now, you must forget about me, Alice.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.668
Everything is broken.

46:03.915 --> 46:05.796
No.

46:05.898 --> 46:08.843
How did good deeds bring us to this?

46:10.632 --> 46:12.515
Henry, will you lead her
away now, please?

46:27.115 --> 46:29.555
Our lives are written in the stars.

46:34.030 --> 46:36.158
Then I will defy the stars.

47:02.715 --> 47:05.870
The widow's farm was attacked,

47:05.932 --> 47:10.111
burned by the Pamunkey,
that they might fright us.

47:10.838 --> 47:13.515
The naturals now have a traitor
living amongst them.

47:14.181 --> 47:19.556
To show them that Englishmen will
not be intimidated,

47:19.619 --> 47:23.115
we will occupy more land
in the King's name.

47:23.195 --> 47:25.299
A deed such as this

47:25.368 --> 47:29.771
will shine in English memory and history
for 100 years and more!

47:31.331 --> 47:33.331
This is the proudest day of my life.

47:34.546 --> 47:37.656
Every man must be noble to himself.

47:37.697 --> 47:39.009
Look at him.

47:39.075 --> 47:44.054
There's a man who knows he's no more
than a pissed breeches babe.

47:46.208 --> 47:48.833
That's why men need their wars.

48:06.040 --> 48:07.280
Glory!

48:10.475 --> 48:13.595
For Christ and Saint George!

48:23.396 --> 48:25.709
It is a sign, ma'am,

48:26.007 --> 48:28.880
that them flames can't take all of life.
