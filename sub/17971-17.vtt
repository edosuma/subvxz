04:11.552 --> 04:12.751
Everything checks
out, Cleveland.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.754
Your flatulence is a
perfectly normal side effect

04:15.756 --> 04:16.688
of a high-fiber diet.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.358
So you're saying
all this farting is okay?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.827
No, I'm saying it's
medically necessary.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.495
But what
about the social stigma?

04:23.497 --> 04:26.798
Won't people consider me
a gross, farting pig

04:26.800 --> 04:28.100
like Tommy Lasorda?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.034
I'll write you a note.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.470
You mean a free pass
to pass gas

04:31.472 --> 04:34.139
wherever and whenever
I want to?

04:34.141 --> 04:36.108

is a fart card,

Good-bye.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.797
I am so sorry,
Cleveland.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.966
Loretta had no next
of kin in Quahog,

10:00.968 --> 10:05.103
so one of my old friends is
driving the body down here.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.472
The funeral is... Friday.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.307
(farts)
There she is.

10:10.209 --> 10:10.909
Oh, what a drive.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.412
13 hours is a long way with
only one hand on the wheel.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.314
Oh!
Ha, sex.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.683
You want to see her?

10:20.119 --> 10:23.221
Why is she wearing
a French maid's costume?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.423
'Cause I wanted to nail
a dead French maid.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.358
Giggity, giggity!

10:26.360 --> 10:29.160
I've... missed you,
Glenn.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.195
Do you know
how she died?

10:30.197 --> 10:34.966
Yep, it all started when Brian
dug up a brontosaurus skull.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.503
All right,
little more, little more.

10:38.505 --> 10:41.806
I'll have this sucker
in the bedroom in no time.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.408
(creaking rumble)

10:43.410 --> 10:44.209
(alarm beeps)

10:44.211 --> 10:46.811
Oh, time
for <i>United States of Tara.</i>

10:46.813 --> 10:48.847
(rumbling)

10:50.049 --> 10:54.052
No, no, no, no, no, <i>no!</i>

10:54.054 --> 10:54.886
Oh, God!

10:54.888 --> 10:55.553
Wait, what's that?

10:55.555 --> 10:58.089
Oh, look
at her gross boobs.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.090
(laughter)

10:59.092 --> 11:01.326
Well, I'll run her over
to the funeral home.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.927
Then I'm heading up to Langley.

11:02.929 --> 11:03.828
Got a background gag

11:03.830 --> 11:05.964
in a bachelor party scene
on <i>American Dad.</i>

11:05.966 --> 11:07.532
Oh, that... that's good.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.933
Paying work.

11:08.935 --> 11:09.401
Save it.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.469
Have fun on your
spin-off, Joey.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.504
I will!

11:12.506 --> 11:14.039
And this ain't no <i>Joey,</i>

11:14.041 --> 11:15.807
you one-note (bleep)!

11:15.809 --> 11:17.175
We are so sorry,
Cleveland.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.078
Please accept our tuna
for this difficult time.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.814
It's a pity you two
will have to drop out

11:22.816 --> 11:24.716
of the karaoke finals.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.251
Such a disappointment.

11:26.253 --> 11:26.918
Excuse me?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.154
I don't think
we're dropping out.
Hell, no.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.589
We're going to win--
to spite Loretta.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.324
She was an awful person.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.460
How did Cleveland Jr.
take the news?

11:35.462 --> 11:39.864
Why would my son care
that my ex-wife is dead?

11:39.866 --> 11:40.265
Oh, boy.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.234

Good evening,
Cleveland Jr.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.349
Hello.
Son,

11:58.351 --> 12:01.753
I have some good news
and some bad news.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.655
Well, can I have
the good news first?

12:03.657 --> 12:06.091
The good news is
that I bought you

12:06.093 --> 12:08.526
a handsome new
funeral suit!

12:08.528 --> 12:09.427
Wow!

12:09.429 --> 12:13.264
("Pretty Woman"
instrumental playing)

12:23.142 --> 12:25.176
(music stops)
And now for the bad news.

12:25.178 --> 12:29.981
Junior, your mother,
Loretta, is dead.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.951
The funeral is Friday.
(farts)

12:32.953 --> 12:35.520
Watch out
for this boy, Lord.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.021
Oh. I see.

12:37.023 --> 12:41.059
Well, that...
that's very sad news.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.194
If you want to cry,
it's okay.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.329
Don't hold it
in, Junior.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.598
I've been reading up
on child grief and...

12:46.600 --> 12:48.199
Oh, Dr. Genstler's book?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.534
Uh, I'm not sure.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.469
It was in that free
parenting magazine

12:51.471 --> 12:52.937
they give away at
the supermarket.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.507
Oh, because Dr. Genstler
said that it's possible

12:55.509 --> 12:58.443
to grieve for a loss
before an actual death.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.011
I've already mourned the loss

13:00.013 --> 13:02.113
of my mother
and that broken family,

13:02.115 --> 13:03.782
and now I have
a new family

13:03.784 --> 13:05.416
that will love
and support me

13:05.418 --> 13:07.385
in a way that,
unfortunately,

13:07.387 --> 13:09.587
my biological mother
never could.

13:09.589 --> 13:13.424
I still don't know
if you're smart or stupid.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.392
So, you're okay?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.594
Well, I'm sad that Mom
was never able to find

13:16.596 --> 13:18.830
what she was looking for
in her life, Daddy,

13:18.832 --> 13:21.499
but yeah, I'm okay.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.400
Okay, Junior,

13:22.402 --> 13:25.303
but we're here
if you need us.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.908
That boy is a ticking bomb.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.377
Say, you up
for a nooner?
No.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.845
What time is it?
1:30.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.914
You up for
a one-thirtier?

13:35.916 --> 13:36.381
No!

13:36.383 --> 13:37.982
See you at 2:00.
(snaps fingers)

13:37.984 --> 13:40.084
(clicks tongue, farts)

13:40.086 --> 13:42.253
(bell tolls)

13:44.490 --> 13:46.424
Mmm. Poor Junior.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.992
Keeping it all in.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.761
You watch--
in 20 minutes,

13:49.763 --> 13:51.396
we'll be picking
up the pieces.

13:51.398 --> 13:55.667
And he's a big boy, so there's
gonna be a lot of pieces.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.634
(laughs)

13:56.636 --> 13:59.604
I'm sorry.
That's inappropriate.

14:01.273 --> 14:05.176
Loretta Brown
was a woman I did not know,

14:05.178 --> 14:09.180
but according to Wikipedia,
a woman by that name

14:09.182 --> 14:12.750
won a Grammy in 1989
for Best Spoken Word Album.

14:12.752 --> 14:16.654
Another woman by that name--
or possibly her, as well--

14:16.656 --> 14:18.656
served in the Australian
Parliament

14:18.658 --> 14:21.993
between 1958 and 1964.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.561
Citation needed.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.063
Praise the Lord!

14:25.065 --> 14:26.331
We now commit the body

14:26.333 --> 14:30.435
of Loretta Marie Callender Brown
to the Earth.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.469
(choked sob)

14:31.471 --> 14:33.271
Stay strong, Junior.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.173
(whirring)

14:35.175 --> 14:36.541
(choked sobbing)

14:36.543 --> 14:38.676
(clearing throat)

14:38.678 --> 14:41.946
(sobbing)

14:41.948 --> 14:45.049
No! No!

14:45.051 --> 14:46.751
No! (sobs)

14:46.753 --> 14:49.087
It's too soon!

14:49.089 --> 14:50.088
Why, God?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.723
Why?!
(farts)

14:51.725 --> 14:53.691
(sobs, farts)

14:53.693 --> 14:55.526
I'll miss you both.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.694
All right, close it up.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.130
Who's up for barbecue?

15:01.166 --> 15:03.434
(Cleveland sobbing)

15:03.436 --> 15:06.404
(moaning)

15:09.775 --> 15:11.442
(sobbing)

15:11.444 --> 15:14.312
Do you still love
her, Cleveland?

15:14.314 --> 15:15.413
No. No, baby.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.514
I love you.
(farts)

15:16.516 --> 15:19.684
Having an emotional breakdown
on your ex-wife's casket

15:19.686 --> 15:21.085
is a strange way to show it.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.187
I'm sure I'll have
the same reaction

15:23.189 --> 15:25.623
on your casket
in front of my third wife.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.125
Cleveland, that
was the woman

15:27.127 --> 15:28.526
you always
complained about.

15:28.528 --> 15:32.063
The woman who cheated on you,
who slept with your friends.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.131
Well, one friend.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.265
No, there were more.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.600
Peter Griffin told
me at our wedding.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.203
Mayor West, Ollie Williams,
Frank Sinatra Jr.,

15:39.205 --> 15:41.205
the greased-up
deaf man...
Guy.

15:41.207 --> 15:44.409
The point is, Cleveland,
she wasn't good to you.

15:44.411 --> 15:44.742
I know.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.578
I have no idea
what happened at the funeral.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.648
I don't know why
I lost control or... or...

15:50.650 --> 15:54.052
(sobbing): Or why I'm
still upset about it!

15:54.054 --> 15:56.054
Well, you'd better...

15:56.056 --> 15:57.422
(farting)

15:57.424 --> 15:59.357
You'd better figure
it out, Cleveland,

15:59.359 --> 16:01.492
before you lose
another wife.

16:01.494 --> 16:05.296
I would slam the door, but
the children are sleeping.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.298
I'll act as if you did.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.833
Thanks.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.602
You don't have to be
so damn dramatic!

16:11.604 --> 16:13.171
RALLO:
Don't worry, Cleveland.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.372
She ain't leaving.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.174
She broke.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.445
Hot tea-- how classy.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.313
Do you take it
with one dong or two?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.248
No, it's...
it's too hot for dongs.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.150
Just honey. It's good for the...

16:26.152 --> 16:27.418
the karaoke vocal chords.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.722
Hey, maybe you and Donna
should just give up now, eh?

16:30.724 --> 16:31.756
(chuckles)
Whatever, Tim.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.524
No, no, no. No,
I'm... I'm just...

16:33.526 --> 16:36.627
I'm giving you friendly
trash talk. (stammering)

16:36.629 --> 16:38.396
Now you say something
rude about me

16:38.398 --> 16:39.797
or-or how fat
my mama is.

16:39.799 --> 16:43.134
Look, Tim, Donna's
not even speaking to me,

16:43.136 --> 16:44.402
much less singing
with me,

16:44.404 --> 16:46.604
so you got nothing
to worry about.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.473
McFALL:
Wrong. Dead wrong.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.775
Mrs. Hot Brown's
singing with me.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.745
Say what?
Said she wanted to piss you off

16:53.747 --> 16:55.446
by showing she'd
be happier singing

16:55.448 --> 17:00.785
with the most pathetic piece
of human garbage she could find.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.787
Her words.

17:02.789 --> 17:03.454
(sighs)

17:03.456 --> 17:05.356
I've got one wife that's dead

17:05.358 --> 17:07.258
and one wife that hates me.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.161
Just like O.J. Simpson.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.463
He's hurting bad.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.531
Why else would
a black guy

17:13.533 --> 17:16.100
talk that way about
O.J. Simpson? (chuckles)

17:16.102 --> 17:18.436
Yes, and what kind
of friends would we be

17:18.438 --> 17:19.504
if we didn't help him?

17:19.506 --> 17:20.905
Normal American
male friends.

17:20.907 --> 17:24.475
Let's book while he's
still in the john.

17:28.781 --> 17:32.383
(mouth full):
I don't understand, Loretta.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.620
Why did I cry
at your funeral?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.722
You did me so wrong.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.190
I moved on.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.492
So, why am I upset?

17:42.094 --> 17:44.629
No, no, no, no, no, no!

17:44.631 --> 17:47.532
Wait. That's it.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.402
(high-pitched whooping)

17:51.404 --> 17:52.370
MAN:
Ow!

17:52.372 --> 17:54.739
Hey, I'm trying
to mourn over here.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.274
Oh, it's a cookie.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.309
Thank you.

18:04.384 --> 18:10.388

18:24.471 --> 18:27.271
I am not going
to go out there

18:27.273 --> 18:29.207
and sing "On Top
of Spaghetti."

18:29.209 --> 18:32.210
Well, how about
"Yes, We Have No Bananas"?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.644
(crashing)
Donna, wait.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.847
There's something
I got to tell you.

18:35.849 --> 18:36.547
What, Cleveland?

18:36.549 --> 18:40.184
I figured out why I cried
at Loretta's funeral.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.786
Survivor's guilt.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.087
Survivor's guilt?

18:43.089 --> 18:44.922
What does that
mean, Cleveland?

18:44.924 --> 18:47.358
It means I fell out
of that bathtub

18:47.360 --> 18:50.228
more times
than could possibly be funny--

18:50.230 --> 18:51.662
and never a scratch.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.830
She falls out once,

18:52.832 --> 18:55.333
breaks her neck
and gets Quagmired.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.734
It could have been me.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.903
You cried
at your ex-wife's funeral

18:58.905 --> 19:01.305
because of survivor's guilt?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.508
Donna, let me
ask you something.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.743
Would you cry
if Robert died?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.311
Hush your mouth! (gasps)

19:07.313 --> 19:10.248
You still want to sleep
with him, don't you?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.283
I'd like to be asked.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.918
So I can tell him no.

19:13.920 --> 19:14.785
It's not how it seemed

19:14.787 --> 19:18.055
when you first said
you'd like to be asked.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.491
Survivor's guilt.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.628
No looking back?

19:23.630 --> 19:26.330
No looking back.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.200
McFALL:
Oh, my God.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.736
We do have more olives.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.037
(pop intro)

19:33.039 --> 19:34.539
♪ Love

19:34.541 --> 19:37.441
♪ Love will keep
us together ♪

19:37.443 --> 19:40.444
♪ Think of me,
babe, whenever... ♪

19:40.446 --> 19:41.712
(crowd booing)

19:41.714 --> 19:43.381
Where's the farting?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.882
Any ass can sing.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.784
We want the singing ass.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.786
CROWD:
Cleveland!
Cleveland! Cleveland!

19:48.788 --> 19:51.889
Better give them
what they want, baby.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.359
You are my soul mate.

19:55.361 --> 19:59.830
CROWD: Cleveland! Cleveland!
Cleveland! Cleveland! Cleveland!

19:59.832 --> 20:02.400
(passing gas melodically)

20:02.402 --> 20:03.868
(whooshing)

20:03.870 --> 20:05.803
(cheering and applause)

20:05.805 --> 20:07.905
(sobbing)

20:07.907 --> 20:08.839
You see, Arianna?

20:08.841 --> 20:10.741
I told you you
should have let me

20:10.743 --> 20:12.343
take a poop
on the stage.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.980
Tim, that can't be
your answer to everything.

20:15.982 --> 20:19.283
(crowd cheering)

20:19.285 --> 20:21.719
I love you, Cleveland.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.822
I love you, too, Loretta.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.658
(farts)

20:33.398 --> 20:36.300
(quiet piano)
(no audible dialogue)

20:49.915 --> 20:52.583
CLEVELAND:
<i>Good-bye, Loretta.</i>
