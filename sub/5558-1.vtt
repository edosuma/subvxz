Um...we bought this
place together.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.000
-Right.

IRS troubles,
he can’t afford to leave.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.875
Well, I don’t know!
I can’t see where I’m going!

08:04.875 --> 08:05.792
You’re not looking?!

08:05.792 --> 08:07.291
No, I’m not looking!
I don’t want to look

08:07.291 --> 08:08.583
if the Predator’s down there.

08:08.583 --> 08:13.458
-Oh! Okay, north!
-Okay, okay. Yeah?

08:13.458 --> 08:16.500
Uh...

08:16.500 --> 08:18.083
Yeah.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.208
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,

08:19.208 --> 08:20.625
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.625
Mommy likes that.

08:22.625 --> 08:26.375
-Ahoy, captain.
-(chuckles)

08:26.375 --> 08:27.667
Mmm.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.667
What has happened
to our relationship?

08:29.667 --> 08:30.667
(sighs)

08:34.709 --> 08:37.750

08:47.625 --> 08:51.208
Your first college visit!
Isn’t this exciting?

08:51.208 --> 08:52.625
Uh-huh.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.208
Yeah!

08:54.208 --> 08:55.750
-College, buddy.
-Where you going?!

08:55.750 --> 08:57.959
This is where
it all happens.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.583
Anything you
want to ask me?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.875
No. I think I’m good, Dad.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.458
You sure? ’Cause your sister
tells me you’re a virgin.

09:05.458 --> 09:06.625
What? She doesn’t know.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.333
It’s okay.

09:08.333 --> 09:11.125
I didn’t lose my
virginity until college.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.542
I thought I lost
it in high school,

09:12.542 --> 09:15.542
but that was
disqualified.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.583
How does it
get disqualified?

09:17.583 --> 09:19.667
We were on this couch at
Uncle Dave’s beach house...

09:19.667 --> 09:21.583
Oh, I don’t think I want
to hear this story.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.667
It’s time I told someone, and
I want that someone to be you.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.083
-So...
-No, it doesn’t have to be me.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.166
We’re on this couch,
right, and it starts,

09:27.166 --> 09:30.333
and it is amazing.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.041
I mean, we were both
really into it, right?

09:32.041 --> 09:33.834
And she looks me right in
the eye, and you know what

09:33.834 --> 09:37.208
-she says to me?
-"Never tell this to your son"?

09:37.208 --> 09:39.458
What? No.
She says...

09:39.458 --> 09:41.583
"Okay, let’s do it."

09:41.583 --> 09:43.458
And I’m like, "What?
What are you talking about?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.417
We just did it."

09:44.417 --> 09:47.291
And then I realized...

09:47.291 --> 09:49.125
I was never with her.

09:49.125 --> 09:53.542
I was...with the...

09:53.542 --> 09:55.709
You were with the what?

09:55.709 --> 09:59.709
You know that space between
the two cushions of a couch?

10:01.291 --> 10:04.500
You lost your virginity
to a couch?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.792
It only occurred to me when I
looked down and saw a lint ball

10:06.792 --> 10:10.875
and a nickel stuck to
the end of my penis.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.667
I can’t believe
you’re a doctor.

10:12.667 --> 10:14.709
Yes, well,
speaking of which,

10:14.709 --> 10:16.458
you make sure you
wrap that rascal.

10:16.458 --> 10:20.291
The clap is back.

10:20.291 --> 10:21.208
Don’t worry.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.834
I’ll take good
care of Tyler.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.291
We’re gonna spend some
time in the library,

10:24.291 --> 10:26.208
grab a healthy meal followed
by a prayer meeting.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.458
Then straight
to sleepsville.

10:28.458 --> 10:30.125
All right, honey,
just promise me

10:30.125 --> 10:31.417
you’re gonna make good choices.

10:31.417 --> 10:32.458
-I will. Yeah.
-Okay.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.792
Oh, you know what,
you have a little...

10:33.792 --> 10:34.834
-Mom. Mom.
-Right here.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.625
It’s okay. I got it.
It’s gone now. Gone.

10:36.625 --> 10:39.083
Okay. Made you a
sandwich, so you have...

10:39.083 --> 10:40.583
-Mom, are you kidding?
-No, it’s for you.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.709
Just stick it in your pocket
so you have it for later.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.333
I don’t care if you eat it.
I just want you to take it--

10:44.333 --> 10:46.583
-I’m not going to.
-Just take the sandwich so we

10:46.583 --> 10:48.000
-can all get on with our lives.
-Mom...

10:48.000 --> 10:50.125
There are cranberries in it,
and I want you to have it

10:50.125 --> 10:51.417
in case you need a snack.

10:51.417 --> 10:55.000
Okay.
(chuckles)

10:55.000 --> 10:57.458
I love you!

10:57.458 --> 11:00.375
I wish your mom would shove
her sandwich in my pants.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.917
Let’s talk party options
for the night.

11:04.959 --> 11:06.291
So he didn’t want the sandwich.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.500
-I would’ve eaten it.
-No, it’s not the sandwich.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.417
It’s just...Tyler is
applying to colleges.

11:12.417 --> 11:14.959
I feel like it was just
yesterday he was in diapers.

11:14.959 --> 11:18.041
God, he was so
cute. Do you...

11:18.041 --> 11:20.667
You remember how he used
to call berries "babies"?

11:20.667 --> 11:23.583
Like, "Straw-babies
and rasp-babies."

11:23.583 --> 11:26.041
And black-babies. Screaming
for ’em at the restaurant.

11:26.041 --> 11:29.458
"Eat black-babies!
Eat black-babies!"

11:29.458 --> 11:32.875
Oh. Made that trip to Jamaica
one for the record books.

11:36.917 --> 11:40.291
I can’t believe you would
tell her he isn’t real.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.959
She did it on purpose.

11:41.959 --> 11:44.250
You asked.
What am I supposed to do, lie?

11:44.250 --> 11:46.792
Yes! Billions of people lie
about it every year!

11:46.792 --> 11:48.417
Well, you told me
never to lie.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.000
-Go to your room.
-I don’t have a room.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.625
We’re in a hotel.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.583
Go to the bathroom.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.250
But I don’t have to go.

11:55.250 --> 11:59.125
-Go into the bathroom now.
-Are you kidding me?

12:02.709 --> 12:05.125
(groans)

12:05.125 --> 12:10.333
So, it’s this giant conspiracy
that everyone is in on but me?

12:10.333 --> 12:12.083
The fact that you know
the word "conspiracy"

12:12.083 --> 12:15.417
makes me think maybe
you were ready for the truth.

12:15.417 --> 12:19.083
(sighs) What else has this
entire family been lying about?

12:19.083 --> 12:21.667
-Like, is the Easter...
-Made-up.

12:21.667 --> 12:23.291
-What about the Too...
-Made-up.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.291
-(scoffs)
-All made-up. Everything.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.834
Even God?

12:29.750 --> 12:31.166
That’s real.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.917
(sighs) Up is down
and down is up for me right now.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.625
I need some time alone.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.667
Okay. I-I think the closet
is still available.

12:38.667 --> 12:41.041
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

12:41.041 --> 12:44.834
And you have some serious
trust to rebuild here.

12:44.834 --> 12:46.875
How could she be so smart
and not have figured it out yet?

12:46.875 --> 12:50.709
Because, Tim, she is a
sweet, innocent child.

12:50.709 --> 12:53.417
Or she was. Our last baby.

12:53.417 --> 12:55.208
I mean, first Tyler
and now this.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.083
I just don’t know how
much more I can take.

12:58.083 --> 13:02.500
Mom, I think I
got my period.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.750
Oh, my God.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.542
Congratulations.

13:06.542 --> 13:08.750
What do you mean you don’t know
how to get ice? You just push

13:08.750 --> 13:10.709
the giant button that says
"Ice" and the ice...

13:10.709 --> 13:13.417
Whoa. What are you...
Mmm.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.792
-Oh.
-I want to have another baby.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.417
-What, here?
-Hurry up. Let’s do it now

13:18.417 --> 13:20.166
before the kids wake up and
then they wonder where we are.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.375
I don’t know if we should be
having another kid

13:21.375 --> 13:23.417
if we’re hiding
from the ones we already have.

13:23.417 --> 13:24.792
No, our fourth one
will be different.

13:24.792 --> 13:25.917
This’ll be our special baby.

13:25.917 --> 13:28.875
We will finally get
everything right.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.667
Mmm. Oh, God, you’re making
a lot of sense right now. Yeah.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.208
You know what, what are the odds
we mess up four in a row, right?

13:34.208 --> 13:35.542
-Right?
-Let’s do this.

13:35.542 --> 13:37.291
It can still work, right?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.625
I tell you
I want to have a baby with you,

13:42.625 --> 13:44.709
and then you call me old.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.250
No, that was
a practical question.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.291
I would never call you old.
I’m old.

13:48.291 --> 13:51.041
We’re the same age.
You have to know

13:51.041 --> 13:54.083
how I’m going to react if you
say something like that to me.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.625
No, you see, that’s just it.
I don’t know.

13:55.625 --> 13:56.750
Because I don’t
know what I’m saying.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.041
Nine times out of ten,
I don’t think. I just speak.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.750
So when I ask,
"Can it still work?"

14:00.750 --> 14:03.208
I just want to know if we’re
playing with live bullets.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.875
Well, you’re the bullets,
so you tell me.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.959
-Oh, my bullets are live.
-Yeah?

14:07.959 --> 14:14.125
Yeah. I just want to know
if the target is...fresh.

14:14.125 --> 14:18.875
So right there, were you...
thinking or just speaking again?

14:18.875 --> 14:22.041
I thought I was thinking,
but turns out I just spoke.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.625
Yeah.

14:23.625 --> 14:24.583
-Come on.
-No.

14:24.583 --> 14:26.959
I think I’m good.
I’m-I’m...

14:26.959 --> 14:29.125
Yeah, I’m good.
I’m good. I’m good.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.709
(sighs)
Heather.

14:31.709 --> 14:32.959
Do you still want the ice?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.792
(groans)
Geez.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.792
(knocking)

14:37.792 --> 14:40.083
Rise and shine,
High School.

14:40.083 --> 14:45.417
Your parental
units are here.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.417
BOY GEORGE:<i> ♪ Karma, karma,</i>
<i>karma, karma, karma</i>

14:47.417 --> 14:50.000
<i>chameleon... ♪</i>

14:50.000 --> 14:53.834
-So, how was it?
<i>-♪ You come and go... ♪</i>

14:53.834 --> 14:57.250
(retching, others groaning)

14:57.250 --> 15:00.542
<i>♪ If your colors</i>
<i>were like my dream... ♪</i>

15:00.542 --> 15:03.583
You ate your sandwich.

15:03.583 --> 15:04.875
That’s classic.

15:08.709 --> 15:11.125
(organ playing)

15:12.917 --> 15:15.834
Kids,
I just want you to know

15:15.834 --> 15:18.208
that it’s okay
that you’re not crying.

15:18.208 --> 15:22.083
’Cause we each grieve
over your father’s...death

15:22.083 --> 15:24.041
in different ways.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.041
Yeah. Putting on quite a show,
huh, Mom?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.500
Yeah, how are we supposed
to act?

15:27.500 --> 15:29.291
I’ve never been to
one of these before.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.000
It’s gonna be okay.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.166
That’s how you act.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.542
Thank you, sweetie.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.250
Your father would be
proud of you.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.250
Oh, here he is now.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.667
(fanfare)

15:40.667 --> 15:42.750
-Are we supposed to clap?
JOHN: Hello,

15:42.750 --> 15:45.709
and thank you all
for coming to my funeral.

15:45.709 --> 15:48.917
Is this a cool
70th birthday party or what?

15:48.917 --> 15:50.875
-(scattered chuckles)
-I actually thought of it

15:50.875 --> 15:54.208
after going to my dear friend
Chuck’s funeral,

15:54.208 --> 15:56.583
and I thought,
"Wouldn’t he be tickled

15:56.583 --> 16:00.000
to hear everybody’s kind words?"

16:00.000 --> 16:01.417
So I said to Joanie,

16:01.417 --> 16:03.625
"I don’t want to miss that.
Let’s just do this

16:03.625 --> 16:06.166
while I’m still here
to enjoy it." And, besides,

16:06.166 --> 16:11.291
this is a-a terrific opportunity
to bring my busy family together

16:11.291 --> 16:13.792
with everyone’s lives
moving so fast.

16:13.792 --> 16:15.375
My grandson, Tyler,

16:15.375 --> 16:17.375
he’s applying for college.

16:17.375 --> 16:21.125
His sister, Samantha,
she just had her first period.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.542
And my son, Greg,

16:22.542 --> 16:25.125
had our fourth grandchild

16:25.125 --> 16:28.208
with, uh...his wife.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.583
Your dad just forgot
my name again.

16:29.583 --> 16:32.542
-No, he didn’t.
-His...wonderful wife.

16:32.542 --> 16:35.500
It’s cool. I’ve only been a part
of this family for five years.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.375
There she is.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.667
So, enough of my yakking.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.834
Let’s get on with the eulogies,
huh? Cheers.

16:42.834 --> 16:43.875
(applause, slurping)

16:43.875 --> 16:46.834
GREG: "Pour away the ocean
and sweep up the woods,

16:46.834 --> 16:48.333
"For nothing now

16:48.333 --> 16:51.917
"can ever come
to any good."

16:51.917 --> 16:54.041
-Thank you.
-(scattered applause)

16:54.041 --> 16:56.834
Honey, did you write that?

16:56.834 --> 16:58.583
That should be published.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.417
Thanks, Mom.
(chuckles)

17:00.417 --> 17:01.875
Stole that from<i> Four Weddings</i>
<i>and a Funeral.</i>

17:01.875 --> 17:03.625
Who stole it from W.H. Auden.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.291
So technically I didn’t steal
it. I just performed it.

17:06.291 --> 17:09.792
Okay, Dad, um, I love you,

17:09.792 --> 17:11.625
and, um, yeah, I-I miss you.

17:11.625 --> 17:12.959
Stop talking to me.

17:12.959 --> 17:14.875
But I’m not talking to you.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.291
I’m-I’m talking to you

17:16.291 --> 17:18.417
like you were in heaven.
You stop talking to me.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.083
JOHN: Well,
whatever you’re doing,

17:20.083 --> 17:21.542
it’s-it’s not good.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.125
It takes everybody out of this.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.417
You don’t think
that you sitting there

17:25.417 --> 17:27.375
is taking people out of this?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.625
-May I continue?
JOHN: Well, it depends

17:30.625 --> 17:32.667
on what you’re gonna say.
I mean, obviously,

17:32.667 --> 17:35.083
you didn’t come here
very prepared.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.417
MATT: Okay. Okay. Great.

JOAN: What can
I say about this man

18:13.500 --> 18:16.333
that I have cherished

18:16.333 --> 18:18.458
for 49 years?

18:18.458 --> 18:20.208
I just love him.

18:22.542 --> 18:23.500
I’m sorry.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.500
Easy on the waterworks, Joanie.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.208
-No.
-They get it, honey.

18:27.208 --> 18:28.500
JOAN: This is real,

18:28.500 --> 18:30.417
you son of a bitch.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.875
I mean, not this,
not this. But that?

18:32.875 --> 18:36.000
That’s real. And someday
I’m gonna be standing up here,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.125
and you’re not
gonna be saying,

18:38.125 --> 18:41.709
"Easy on the waterworks,"
are you?

18:41.709 --> 18:43.750
Oh, I’m so sorry.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.208
It’s just so ridiculous,

18:45.208 --> 18:46.792
this whole thing!

18:48.625 --> 18:51.208
Jerky idea. Jerk!

18:54.667 --> 18:56.625
-(tooting)
-No!

18:56.625 --> 18:58.417
It’s clear we are
not doing that.

18:58.417 --> 18:59.542
Ow.

18:59.542 --> 19:02.583
HEATHER: Mom, are you okay?
You guys all right?

19:02.583 --> 19:06.291
Hey, uh, I’d like
to apologize.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.166
This was a terrible idea.

19:08.166 --> 19:12.417
You kept asking why don’t
more people do this.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.542
This is why.

19:14.542 --> 19:16.083
JOHN: I don’t want to die.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.458
Who said anything
about you dying?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.333
Everyone. Were you
not listening?

19:20.333 --> 19:22.250
Look, what you
kids don’t get

19:22.250 --> 19:24.083
is life is about these moments,

19:24.083 --> 19:26.458
<i>these pieces of time,</i>

19:26.458 --> 19:29.291
<i>these slices of life</i>
<i>that flash by,</i>

19:29.291 --> 19:32.333
<i>but they stay</i>
<i>in your heart forever.</i>

19:32.333 --> 19:35.250
But I’m running out of moments.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.667
How many more do I get?

19:36.667 --> 19:38.625
Oh, honey. No.

19:38.625 --> 19:41.667
We still have
plenty of time left.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.750
70 is the new 80.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.458
You mean the new 60.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.792
Whatever. The point is

19:46.792 --> 19:50.208
that we still have
many wonderful years left.

19:50.208 --> 19:53.625
-Oh.
-Mmm.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.250
(sniffles)
I just hope I die

19:55.250 --> 19:58.000
before you, so I don’t have
to go through this again.

20:00.709 --> 20:03.667
Psst! Psst!
Hey, Joanie.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.291
(gasps):
Oh!

20:05.291 --> 20:06.959
What are you
doing in there?!

20:06.959 --> 20:09.000
I just wanted to see
what it feels like.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.041
You’re sick! Get out of there.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.667
Oh, it feels really good
on my back.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.834
Hey, and there’s room in here
for you, too. (chuckles)

20:16.834 --> 20:20.250
-Is there?
-Yeah.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.125
Turn on your side.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.834
-Oh! Oh, honey.
-(knocking)

20:26.834 --> 20:28.208
JOHN: Hey!
-Oh.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.125
-Johnny?
JOHN: There’s no air in here!

20:30.125 --> 20:31.500
It’s just jammed!

20:31.500 --> 20:33.750
Oh, help! Help!

20:33.750 --> 20:35.291
JOHN: Joanie, what are you
waiting for?

20:35.291 --> 20:36.750
Lift the damn lid.

20:36.750 --> 20:37.709
JOAN: Go!
MATT: Dad, shut up

20:37.709 --> 20:40.000
or you’re gonna run out of air!

20:40.000 --> 20:42.041
What? What is going on?

20:42.041 --> 20:44.166
Their tools weren’t working,
so we got to roll him

20:44.166 --> 20:45.792
to the Jiffy Lube
across the street.

20:45.792 --> 20:49.291
JOHN: I don’t like this.
I don’t like it in here.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.959
JEN: Hey, watch the corner!

20:50.959 --> 20:53.959
JOAN: Hurry, before there’s
a dead body in this casket!

20:55.083 --> 21:01.166
