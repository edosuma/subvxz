WEBVTT

00:12.400 --> 00:14.467
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.500 --> 00:16.200
(Cristina) HE'S GONE.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.333
IT'S OVER... SO OVER.

00:18.367 --> 00:21.700
DR. BURKE HANDED IN HIS LETTER
OF RESIGNATION TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:21.733 --> 00:25.133
I WAS NAMED CHIEF RESIDENT.
I WOULD'VE MADE
AN EXCELLENT CHIEF RESIDENT.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.200
WE'RE BREAKING UP.
A BREAKUP KISS.

00:27.233 --> 00:29.467
A BREAKUP KISS.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.800
I'M LEXIE. LEXIE GREY.
I'M YOUR SISTER.

00:31.833 --> 00:34.700
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?
I'M ALL ALONE IN A FOREST--

00:34.733 --> 00:37.200
ALL ALONE IN THE FOREST,
GEORGE--AND WHERE ARE YOU?

00:37.233 --> 00:39.200
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.400
***

00:44.433 --> 00:48.067
(Meredith) IN THE HOSPITAL,
WE SEE ADDICTION EVERY DAY.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.433
I-I FEEL THIS, UH, THIS...

00:50.467 --> 00:51.500
THIS, UH, THIS EXHILARATION.

00:51.533 --> 00:54.300
IT'S LIKE I--IT'S LIKE
I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

00:54.333 --> 00:57.267
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE?
IT'S LIKE WHEN--

00:57.300 --> 00:59.200
IT'S LIKE I WAS SLEEPING,
AND I--IT'S LIKE I WOKE UP.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.100
AND IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST AMAZING.

01:01.133 --> 01:02.800
***

01:02.833 --> 01:05.767
IT'S SHOCKING HOW MANY KINDS
OF ADDICTION EXIST.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.733
THIS IS
THE BEST BREAKUP EVER.

01:07.767 --> 01:11.067
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DIDN'T
BREAK UP A LONG TIME AGO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:11.100 --> 01:13.400
SLEEPING.
NO. NO SLEEPOVERS.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.733
YES. COME ON. PLEASE.
IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.667
I GOTTA WORK TOMORROW.
WE AGREED. NO SLEEPOVERS.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.733
BROKEN UP PEOPLE
DON'T SLEEP OVER. SEX ONLY.

01:19.767 --> 01:23.367
IT'S THE ONLY PART OF
THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WORKS.
I KNOW. WHY SCREW IT UP
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, RIGHT?

01:23.400 --> 01:24.633
DINNER, CONVERSATIONS.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.567
YOU'RE MOCKING MY SEVERE
EMOTIONAL LIMITATIONS.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.500
YOU KNOW, I COULD LIVE
WITHOUT CONVERSATION.

01:28.533 --> 01:30.433
I COULD LIVE WITHOUT MEALS
OR SLEEPOVERS.

01:30.467 --> 01:32.667
WELL, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
SLEEPOVERS BECAUSE YOU SNORE.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.800
(both laugh)

01:33.833 --> 01:37.100
BUT MOCKERY? MOCKERY, UNH-UNH.
THAT'S A DEAL BREAKER.

01:37.133 --> 01:39.133
OKAY, SEX AND MOCKERY
IT IS.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.600
IT WOULD BE TOO EASY
IF IT WAS JUST DRUGS

01:41.633 --> 01:44.267
AND BOOZE AND CIGARETTES.
SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME,

01:44.300 --> 01:45.633
AND--AND, YOU KNOW, MY DAD,

01:45.667 --> 01:47.567
HE C--
OH, GOD, HE LOVED HER.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.267
AND--AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN HE DIED

01:50.300 --> 01:53.467
THEN HE... I...

01:53.500 --> 01:55.667
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.567
I THINK THE HARDEST PART
OF KICKING A HABIT

01:58.600 --> 02:00.500
IS WANTING TO KICK IT.

02:00.533 --> 02:02.700
***

02:02.733 --> 02:06.300
I MEAN, WE GET ADDICTED
FOR A REASON, RIGHT?

02:06.333 --> 02:09.267
***

02:15.367 --> 02:18.367
***

02:20.633 --> 02:23.500
I THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT,
BUT IT WASN'T. IT'S NOT.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.500
IT'S NOT.
NO.

02:25.533 --> 02:28.433
OFTEN--TOO OFTEN--
THINGS THAT START OUT

02:28.467 --> 02:31.300
AS JUST A NORMAL PART
OF YOUR LIFE

02:31.333 --> 02:33.633
AT SOME POINT
CROSS THE LINE TO OBSESSIVE...

02:33.667 --> 02:35.267
COMPULSIVE...

02:35.300 --> 02:37.100
OUT OF CONTROL.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.733
I... I GOTTA TELL HER.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.233
I HAVE TO TELL HER
THAT THE MARRIAGE IS OVER.

02:41.267 --> 02:42.700
IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

02:42.733 --> 02:46.067
***

02:46.100 --> 02:47.667
(door slams)

02:47.700 --> 02:50.700
***

02:50.733 --> 02:54.300
DID YOU SEE HOW I WALKED OUT
OF HERE ALL DETERMINED?

02:54.333 --> 02:56.367
IT MADE ME PROUD.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.400
***

02:58.433 --> 03:00.167
IT'S THE HIGH WE'RE CHASING,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.433
THE HIGH THAT MAKES
EVERYTHING ELSE FADE AWAY.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.600
HE LOVES ME, TOO.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.567
(Richard) WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE BOARD?

03:09.600 --> 03:11.500
GOOD. IT LOOKS GOOD.
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

03:11.533 --> 03:12.733
OH, I DIDN'T DO IT.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.367
I'M DELEGATING.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.733
I AM BEING A DELEGATOR.

03:15.767 --> 03:18.767
I'M DOING IT ALL DIFFERENT,
MAKING TIME FOR MY WIFE.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.500
OH, YEAH?
SHE TALKING TO YOU YET?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.433
SHE WILL WHEN SHE SEES
I'M A DELEGATOR.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.833
MM. I-I SHOULD MOVE
THAT SURGERY UP THERE.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.467
JUNKIE.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.200
YEAH. RIGHT, RIGHT.
IT'S GOOD. I MEAN, IT'S FINE.

03:29.233 --> 03:30.100
OKAY.

03:30.133 --> 03:33.267
I'M DELEGATING. SEE?
BEING A DELEGATOR.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.400
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE CHIEF?

03:36.433 --> 03:37.433
HE'S A JUNKIE.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.300
HIM? YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO LOOKS ALL STRUNG OUT.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.233
I'M JUST TIRED.
LET ME GUESS.

03:42.267 --> 03:43.867
YOU AND MEREDITH
ARE BACK TOGETHER,

03:43.900 --> 03:47.033
AND YOU'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
DOING THE HORIZONTAL SALSA.
MAMBO. HORIZONTAL MAMBO.

03:47.067 --> 03:49.367
AND MEREDITH AND I,
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.267
SEXY FRIENDS?
YOU'RE LIKE THE WORST,

03:51.300 --> 03:53.800
MOST JUVENILE HUMAN BEING
I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.567
YOU KNOW THE FIRST STEP
TO RECOVERY IS ADMITTING

03:55.600 --> 03:58.400
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?
HOW MANY NURSES HAVE YOU
SLEPT WITH THIS WEEK?

03:58.433 --> 04:01.433
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM, MAN.
THAT'S AN ADVENTURE.

04:01.467 --> 04:02.400
(laughs)

04:02.433 --> 04:04.600
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.533
I KNOW. IT'S A BELGIAN FLIP
ROUND PRO.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.467
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR IT?
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.400
NEXT TIME I GET
A PROJECTILE VOMITER,

04:10.433 --> 04:12.733
I COULD LOSE YOUR PAGER NUMBER.
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.733
SURGERIES, BABY.
PREFERABLY CARDIO.

04:14.767 --> 04:15.967
ARE THESE ALL WEDDING GIFTS?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.733
YES. SHE'S GIVING THEM AWAY.
I HAVE DIBS ON THE MIXMASTER.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.533
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
THE MIXMASTER.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.133
I THINK THE TRADITION IS
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO RETURN THEM.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.067
WELL, BURKE REGISTERED
FOR THIS CRAP.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.733
NOW I'M THE ONE STUCK
DEALING WITH IT.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.767
SO I'M USING IT
FOR PROFESSIONAL GAIN.
YOU SURE YOU'RE READY
TO PART WITH THIS?

04:29.800 --> 04:33.333
SHE'S NOT. I WANT IT.
I WANT IT.
I AM IF I CAN HELP
ON THE RHOMBOID FLAP

04:33.367 --> 04:35.367
IN YOUR NEXT
MOHS DEFECT REPAIR.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.200
COME TO DADDY.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.833
HA!
OOH!

04:39.867 --> 04:42.133
YOU STEAL THIS STUFF?
MAKE HER GIVE ME SOMETHING.

04:42.167 --> 04:44.067
GIVE HER SOMETHING.
GIVE ME THE MIXMASTER.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.133
FACE IT.
YOU HAVE NOTHING I WANT.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.600
WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THE RESIDENTS.

04:48.633 --> 04:51.167
BIG, SNAZZY RESIDENTS,
STANDING AROUND

04:51.200 --> 04:52.667
PLAYING WITH HOUSEWARES.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.300
TURN A BLIND EYE
AND THE SOUP TUREEN'S YOURS.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.800
FOUR!

05:00.833 --> 05:02.600
TAKE THIS MIX--HEY!

05:02.633 --> 05:04.333
TAKE THE MIXMASTER

05:04.367 --> 05:06.633
AND ALL THIS CRAP
AND PUT IT IN MY LOCKER.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.467
(pager beeps)

05:08.500 --> 05:11.633
CARNAGE IN THE PIT.
MY DAY'S IMPROVING.

05:14.233 --> 05:15.433
FOLLOW.

05:15.467 --> 05:16.700
OH.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.633
UH, WE'RE NOT GONNA ROUND?

05:18.667 --> 05:20.833
CARNAGE TRUMPS ROUNDS, THREE.
WRITE THAT DOWN.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.800
CARNAGE ALWAYS TRUMPS ROUNDS.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.300
CALLIE.
OH, HEY. I KNOW, I KNOW.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.233
I NEVER MADE IT HOME
LAST NIGHT.

05:27.267 --> 05:29.167
BUT I GOT SWAMPED
WITH PAPERWORK

05:29.200 --> 05:31.100
AND FELL ASLEEP
IN AN ON CALL ROOM.

05:31.133 --> 05:33.067
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
WHEN YOU HAVE TIME.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.700
(sighs) I HAVE NO TIME.
I'M OUT OF TIME.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.633
THIS CHIEF RESIDENT THING
IS KICKING MY ASS.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.733
LATER, THEN.
TONIGHT, WHEN WE'RE ALONE?
IS IT SERIOUS?

05:39.767 --> 05:41.633
(Richard) WHAT DO WE GOT?

05:41.667 --> 05:43.567
A GAS MAIN BLEW
IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.500
FIVE INJURED, SOME BADLY.
EXCELLENT.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.267
HORRIBLE.
IT'S HORRIBLE. SAD.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.633
MARLA KRISTLER,
34-YEAR-OLD FEMALE,

05:51.667 --> 05:53.600
ABDOMEN BLOWN OUT,
SKULL FRACTURE,

05:53.633 --> 05:56.033
THIRD-DEGREE BURNS OVER
AT LEAST 40% OF HER BODY.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.800
OKAY, I GOT THIS.
OPEN O.R. TWO.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.800
PAGE DR. SHEPHERD.
TORRES, TRIAGE THE REST.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.733
YES, SIR. YANG, YOU'RE WITH
THE CHIEF. GO.

06:01.767 --> 06:03.667
OH, THANK YOU.
UH, ONE, FOUR, COME WITH ME.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.067
(Lexie) WHAT ABOUT US?

06:05.100 --> 06:07.067
UH... GO HELP BAILEY
IN THE CLINIC.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.800
(child crying)

06:09.833 --> 06:11.733
MY WIFE--SHE CAME IN
IN ANOTHER AMBULANCE.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.233
IS SHE HERE? WHERE--
WHERE'D THEY TAKE HER?
YEAH, YEAH.

06:14.267 --> 06:17.233
SHE'LL BE GOING STRAIGHT TO
SURGERY. SIR, ARE YOU INJURED?
NO. MY SON!

06:17.267 --> 06:19.167
18 MONTHS OLD, CONTUSIONS,
POSSIBLE HEAD INJURY.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.533
B.P. AND PULSE ARE ELEVATED.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.767
(crying)
(speaking indistinctly)

06:22.800 --> 06:25.267
KAREV!
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
ON PLASTICS.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.467
I'LL TAKE IT.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.567
I CALLED KAREV.
YOU'RE WITH THE KRISTLERS.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.467
WH-WHAT ABOUT ME?
(crying continues)

06:30.500 --> 06:33.367
OH, YOU UP LATE LAST NIGHT?
YOU LOOK A LITTLE TIRED.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.267
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.800
I'M FINE. NOT UP LATE.
WENT TO BED EARLY.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.800
EARLY AND ALONE.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.500
(Mark) HELLO, MISTER...

06:41.533 --> 06:43.133
(strained voice)
ROCHE. ARCHIE ROCHE.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.467
AGE 60,
SECOND- AND THIRD-DEGREE BURNS

06:45.500 --> 06:48.267
OVER CHEST AND UPPER ABDOMEN,
FACIAL CONTUSIONS

06:48.300 --> 06:50.333
AND POSSIBLE SHOULDER FRACTURE.
ONE MINUTE I'M READING
THE SPORTS SECTION,

06:50.367 --> 06:52.333
THE NEXT I'M FLAT ON MY BACK
LOOKING UP AT A HOLE

06:52.367 --> 06:54.367
IN THE CEILING RIGHT INTO
DAVE AND MARLA'S APARTMENT.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.333
THESE BURNS SHOULD BE DEBRIDED
WHILE HE GETS WORKED UP.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.267
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL DO A TRAUMA
SERIES AND SHOULDER FILMS.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.733
STEVENS.
GOT IT.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.467
(Mark) WHERE'S YOUR PAIN?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.067
JUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL TAKE CARE
OF MARLA AND THE BABY, OKAY?
ARE THEY YOUR FAMILY, SIR?

07:04.100 --> 07:06.167
THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.100
(Derek) HOW CLOSE
TO THE EXPLOSION WAS HE?

07:08.133 --> 07:10.367
OH, WE WERE, UH, WE WERE
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

07:10.400 --> 07:12.300
HIS MOM WAS IN THE KITCHEN.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.133
THE GAS LINE BLEW?
I-I THINK IT WAS THE STOVE.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.400
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA RUN
SOME TESTS ON YOUR BABY.

07:17.433 --> 07:20.233
KAREV, I'M GOING INTO SURGERY
WITH THE CHIEF. KEEP ME POSTED.

07:20.267 --> 07:22.700
MARLA AND DAVID ARE FRIENDS.
I WAS JUST LEAVING

07:22.733 --> 07:24.600
WHEN THE--
WHEN THE KITCHEN BLEW UP.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.633
THE BLAST KNOCKED ME
INTO A WALL.

07:26.667 --> 07:29.400
OH. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

07:29.433 --> 07:30.433
OH.

07:30.467 --> 07:33.500
GRIM.
YOU GUYS LOOK GRIM.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.600
UH, CLARK,
WE NEED TO GET A C.T.

07:35.633 --> 07:38.100
JUST TO CHECK
FOR INTERNAL BLEEDING.

07:38.133 --> 07:41.233
INTERNAL BLEEDING?
I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK.

07:41.267 --> 07:42.767
(pager beeps)

07:42.800 --> 07:45.667
UM, HEY, I NEED A RESIDENT
TO HELP ME OUT IN THE CLINIC

07:45.700 --> 07:48.567
TO OVERSEE THE NEW INTERNS WHILE
I'M WORKING ON THIS PATIENT.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.733
NO, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP.

07:50.767 --> 07:53.633
YOU CAN'T HELP?
THE CLINIC IS VOLUNTARY,
BAILEY.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.333
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE
ANY RESIDENTS TO GO IN THERE

07:56.367 --> 07:58.267
WITH THIS MUCH GOING ON
IN THE PIT,

07:58.300 --> 08:02.067
BUT YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY INTERNS
AS YOU NEED, OKAY?

08:02.100 --> 08:05.100
AND TELL DR. KENT HE'S
GOTTA FIND HIMSELF ANOTHER O.R.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.700
THE CHIEF'S TAKING HIS.
I WANT THE WAFFLE MAKER.

08:06.733 --> 08:09.767
HAVEN'T WE
ALREADY COVERED THIS?
YEAH, BUT NOW I GOT
SOMETHING YOU WANT.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.300
OH, YEAH? WHAT?

08:15.067 --> 08:16.533
HELLO.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.467
I'M JANE BURKE.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
DR. BURKE'S MOTHER.
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.200
UH, I'M LOOKING FOR
DR. CRISTINA YANG.

08:23.233 --> 08:25.433
YANG, YANG? LET ME SEE.
DR. YANG...

08:25.467 --> 08:28.333
I'LL PAGE HER, BUT I THINK
SHE'S IN SURGERY.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.833
I'LL WAIT.

08:29.867 --> 08:32.733
OKAY.

08:32.767 --> 08:35.767
WAFFLE MAKER?
FINE.

08:45.267 --> 08:46.667
HEY. WHAT'S THE 9-1-1?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.167

09:42.767 --> 09:43.833
SCHEDULE AN M.R.I.

09:43.867 --> 09:47.067
AND HAVE THE LAB RUN
A TOX SCREEN ON BRIAN'S BLOOD.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.433
WHY?

09:48.467 --> 09:51.100
BECAUSE I SAID SO,
NANCY DREW. JUST DO IT.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.467
(Dave) IT'S OKAY, BRIAN.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.367
ROOMS ONE AND SEVEN ARE PRIVATE
AND SHOULD BE USED

09:55.400 --> 09:57.533
FOR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS
WITH PATIENTS,

09:57.567 --> 09:59.267
NOT FOR CLOSED-DOOR SOCIALIZING.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.200
ALL CARTS ARE SETUP
THE SAME.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.133
MEMORIZE
WHERE EVERYTHING IS.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.433
WILL WE BE ABLE
TO DO PROCEDURES ON OUR OWN?

10:06.467 --> 10:08.200
NO. YOU ARE INTERNS.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.167
YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF NOTHING.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.800
ALL PROCEDURES WILL BE DISCUSSED
AND OVERSEEN BY AN UPPER LEVEL.

10:13.833 --> 10:16.067
ALL CHARTS WILL BE SIGNED OUT
BY AN UPPER LEVEL.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.667
AND ALL PATIENTS

10:17.700 --> 10:19.767
WILL BE LOOKED AT
BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOU!

10:19.800 --> 10:21.567
AND WHAT IF--OOH!
I'M SORRY.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.300
UH, I, UH, SORRY.
WHAT IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYONE?

10:27.467 --> 10:29.700
MRS. BURKE.

10:29.733 --> 10:31.767
WHAT A SURPRISE
TO SEE YOU HERE.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.567
ARE YOU VISITING SOMEONE?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.767
YOU'RE THE MAID OF HONOR.
MISS GREY.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.800
THAT'S ME.

10:37.833 --> 10:39.500
WHEN YOU STOOD UP

10:39.533 --> 10:41.433
IN FRONT OF PRESTON'S FRIENDS
AND LOVED ONES

10:41.467 --> 10:46.300
AND YOU SAID, "IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER. IT'S SO OVER,"

10:46.333 --> 10:50.067
WERE YOU TRYING TO SMASH
THE HOPES OF THE BEST MAN,

10:50.100 --> 10:52.467
OR WERE YOU JUST TRYING
TO BE FUNNY?

10:53.800 --> 10:55.367
I--

10:55.400 --> 10:57.600
BECAUSE MAKING LIGHT
OF THAT SITUATION

10:57.633 --> 10:59.600
WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE.

10:59.633 --> 11:02.467
AND TO USE THAT MOMENT

11:02.500 --> 11:05.667
TO SEND A MESSAGE
TO YOUR BOYFRIEND...

11:05.700 --> 11:08.700
WELL, THAT'S... SELFISH.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.733
SO WERE YOU BEING
INAPPROPRIATE,

11:12.767 --> 11:16.067
OR WERE YOU BEING SELFISH?

11:16.100 --> 11:17.267
I, UH...

11:17.300 --> 11:19.533
AM, UH...

11:19.567 --> 11:23.067
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT,
MRS. MAMA, MA'AM.

11:25.067 --> 11:27.333
I'M JUST GONNA GO.

11:27.367 --> 11:28.633
OKAY.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.400
MISS GREY?

11:30.433 --> 11:32.067
YES, MA'AM.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.133
WHEN YOU REPORT BACK
TO CRISTINA,

11:34.167 --> 11:37.100
WOULD YOU TELL HER, PLEASE,
THAT I AM WAITING FOR HER

11:37.133 --> 11:40.800
AND THAT I WILL CONTINUE
TO WAIT FOR HER?

11:40.833 --> 11:42.633
YES, MA'AM.

11:45.567 --> 11:47.633
OH! SORRY.

11:47.667 --> 11:48.467
SORRY.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.467
ANY NEWS ON MARLA?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.767
MY NEIGHBOR.
I PROMISE,

11:52.800 --> 11:56.267
AS SOON AS I HEAR SOMETHING,
I'LL, UH, GIVE YOU AN UPDATE.

11:58.433 --> 12:00.500
CRAP.

12:00.533 --> 12:02.833
I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

12:02.867 --> 12:04.100
I'M REALLY SORRY.

12:04.133 --> 12:06.633
3-PART
PROXIMAL HUMERUS FRACTURE.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.567
HE'S GONNA NEED
A PERCUTANEOUS REDUCTION

12:08.600 --> 12:10.533
AND INTERNAL FIXATION.

12:10.567 --> 12:13.733
THAT BOY OF THEIRS--BRIAN--
GORGEOUS.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.467
SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT--
KIDS.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.300
SOMETIMES THEY'RE UGLY.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.300
YOU HAVE ANY KIDS, DOCTOR?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.200
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.133
MM. NOT MARRIED EITHER,
ARE YOU?

12:25.167 --> 12:27.067
I'M AFRAID
I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYBODY

12:27.100 --> 12:29.033
WHO WILL PUT UP WITH ME.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.667
WELL, GET ON THE STICK.
DON'T DO LIKE I DID.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.600
DON'T BE A BACHELOR
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

12:33.633 --> 12:36.533
YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THE FIELD
FOR SO LONG.

12:36.567 --> 12:39.433
THEN SUDDENLY ONE DAY,
YOUR WHOLE LIFE PASSES YOU BY,

12:39.467 --> 12:42.500
AND THOSE PARTS AREN'T WORKING
LIKE THEY USED TO.

12:42.533 --> 12:45.200
THEY HAVE MEDICINE
FOR THAT NOW.

12:45.233 --> 12:48.200
THEY DON'T HAVE MEDICINE
FOR THAT "ALL ALONE" PART,

12:48.233 --> 12:49.733
NOW DO THEY?

12:49.767 --> 12:51.400
NO, I SUPPOSE NOT.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.733
MM. YOU GOT SOME PRETTY ONES
RIGHT HERE.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.667
OH, I'M OFF THE MARKET,
MR. ROCHE.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.333
I--I'M VERY HAPPILY MARRIED.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.733
OH. I'M REALLY SORRY.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
SORRY.

13:05.233 --> 13:08.233
YOU CAN'T TELL HER.
WH--

13:10.533 --> 13:12.033
WE DECIDED.

13:12.067 --> 13:14.667
I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL HER.
I HAVE TO TELL HER TONIGHT.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.600
NO, I KNOW. YOU CAN'T.

13:16.633 --> 13:17.833
YOU JUST--YOU CAN'T, OKAY?

13:17.867 --> 13:19.767
I'M WORKING WITH HER.
SHE'S MY BOSS.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.100
DAMN IT!

13:22.133 --> 13:23.500
SHH.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.733
MAYBE IT'LL JUST
WORK ITSELF OUT IF WE WAIT.

13:25.767 --> 13:28.667
YOU'LL GROW APART.
IZZIE--

13:28.700 --> 13:31.167
SHE'S BEEN WORKING LONG HOURS.
MAYBE SHE'S AVOIDING YOU.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.367
MAYBE SHE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR.
IZZIE--

13:33.400 --> 13:36.233
DON'T TELL HER.
HOW LONG WOULD YOU
SUGGEST I WAIT

13:36.267 --> 13:38.167
UNTIL I TELL HER ABOUT US?

13:38.200 --> 13:41.067
I DON'T KNOW. AT LEAST UNTIL
SHE'S NOT IN SUCH A BAD MOOD.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.467
A WEEK? A MONTH?

13:43.500 --> 13:44.667

16:02.267 --> 16:05.367

WITH THAT CHILD.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.733
(crying continues)
IT'S OKAY.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.567
DR. YANG, WAS THAT

I DON'T THINK--
I WOULDN'T KNOW, SIR.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.167
OKAY. HOW ARE WE DOING
UP THERE, SHEPHERD?

16:18.200 --> 16:20.100

FOR ME.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.233
AND--AND IT'S--
AND IT'S GOOD

16:42.267 --> 16:44.167
BECAUSE YOU LEARN

SOMEBODY TO TAKE OVER

17:33.800 --> 17:35.700
SO YOU CAN GO HANDLE THAT?

17:35.733 --> 17:38.167
I'M TRYING TO GET BACK

17:38.200 --> 17:40.100
IN ORDER TO GET BACK
WITH MY WIFE,

17:40.133 --> 17:42.067
I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO--
DELEGATE.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.067
DR. TORRES CAN HANDLE THIS.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.367
THEY WERE SHOOTING HIM UP
WITH--
NO, THEY WEREN'T
SHOOTING HIM UP.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.700
WHEN YOU COOK METH, THE FUMES,
THEY COAT THE WALLS, THE FLOORS.

17:48.733 --> 17:50.667
THE BABY WALKS AROUND,
CRAWLS AROUND,

17:50.700 --> 17:53.533
PUTS ITS HANDS IN ITS MOUTH,
IT GETS IN HIS BLOODSTREAM.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.467
GOD. OKAY, UM, CALL THE POLICE
AND SOCIAL SERVICES.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.100
I'LL SPREAD THE WORD.
WAIT, WHAT ABOUT THE DAD?

17:57.133 --> 17:59.333
HE'S STILL IN THERE
WITH THE KID.
YOU CALL THE POLICE
AND SOCIAL SERVICES.

17:59.367 --> 18:01.333
YOU LET THEM TAKE CARE
OF THE DAD.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.233
YOU TAKE CARE OF THE BABY.
SLOAN.

18:03.267 --> 18:05.267
WE GOT A SITUATION.

18:06.467 --> 18:08.800
YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.833
YOU WERE ACTING
AWFULLY ODD BEFORE,

18:10.867 --> 18:13.033
HAD ME A LITTLE NERVOUS,
BUT--

18:14.733 --> 18:17.133
MR. ROCHE,
I'M GONNA ASK YOU A QUESTION.

18:17.167 --> 18:19.733
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE OFFENDED BY IT,

18:19.767 --> 18:22.333
BUT THE ANSWER COULD AFFECT
YOUR SURGERY.

18:22.367 --> 18:23.700
FINE. FIRE AWAY.

18:23.733 --> 18:25.567
ARE YOU A CRYSTAL METH USER?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.833
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
HE'S, LIKE, 60.

18:27.867 --> 18:30.100
NO JUDGMENT, SIR. ALL I NEED'S
A YES OR NO ANSWER.

18:30.133 --> 18:32.100
CRYSTAL WHAT?
IT'S A DRUG, SIR.

18:32.133 --> 18:34.667
UM, IT'S ADDICTIVE
AND VERY DANGEROUS.

18:34.700 --> 18:37.567
WELL, UNLESS YOU PUT IT
IN MY BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINE,

18:37.600 --> 18:39.400
I-I NEVER TOUCHED THE STUFF.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:41.367 --> 18:43.500
THE KRISTLERS HAD A METH LAB
IN THEIR APARTMENT.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.400
IT'S WHAT CAUSED
THE EXPLOSION.

18:45.433 --> 18:49.267
MARLA AND DAVE HAD
A DRUG LAB IN THEIR APARTMENT?

18:49.300 --> 18:51.033
NO.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.267
IMPOSSIBLE.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.833
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

18:53.867 --> 18:57.067
I'VE KNOWN THOSE TWO
FOR FIVE--FIVE YEARS.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.667
WE GO ON PICNICS,
TO BALL GAMES.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.033
I BABYSIT FOR THEM.

19:05.467 --> 19:08.400
I BABYSIT FOR DRUG DEALERS?

19:13.267 --> 19:14.600
(Bailey) O'MALLEY!

19:14.633 --> 19:16.133
(Callie) WHAT HAPPENED?

19:16.167 --> 19:17.500
HE CODED.
HE CODED?

19:17.533 --> 19:19.733
CODED, OUT OF NOWHERE.
HEART STOPPED. CODED.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.800
PROBABLY A DRUG ADDICT.
WHAT?

19:21.833 --> 19:23.733
THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE
TO TELL YOU.

19:23.767 --> 19:26.500
THAT FIRE THAT HE WAS IN,
IT WAS A METH LAB EXPLOSION.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.400
HE COULD HAVE CARDIOMYOPATHY
FROM METH USE.
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN IT.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.500
OH... IT'S A MIRACLE
I GOT HIM BACK.

19:31.533 --> 19:34.100
WAIT, YOU RAN THE CODE
YOURSELF? WHERE'S GREY?

19:34.133 --> 19:35.600
SHE'S COVERING IN THE CLINIC.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.100
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING
IN THE CLINIC?

19:38.133 --> 19:40.033
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO TAKE INTERNS.

19:40.067 --> 19:41.567
I DIDN'T WANT INTERNS.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.500
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.067
SOME THINGS, O'MALLEY,

19:51.100 --> 19:54.467
SOME THINGS
JUST DON'T NEED TO BE TOLD.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.267
HOW ABOUT HERE?
DOES IT HURT HERE?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.567
WEIRD.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.100
IT FEELS WEIRD?

20:03.133 --> 20:06.233
NO. THAT LADY IS STARING
AT ME... OR MY FAT.

20:06.267 --> 20:09.333
OH, DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S STARING AT ME.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.100
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

20:14.133 --> 20:15.733
(Cristina) WELL?

20:15.767 --> 20:17.733
HOW'D SURGERY GO
ON THE MOM?
YEAH, SHE'LL LIVE.
WHATEVER.

20:17.767 --> 20:19.400
THAT'S NOT THE MOM
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

20:19.433 --> 20:20.767
OH, I TRIED. I TRIED.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.467
MAMA IS NOT BUDGING,
AND SHE IS VERY SCARY.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.133
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.

20:25.167 --> 20:27.733
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?
DID BURKE SEND HER?

20:27.767 --> 20:30.267
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO GO.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.067
YOU HAVE TO
GO DEAL WITH MAMA.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.533
JUST GO GET IT OVER WITH
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

20:34.567 --> 20:36.467
COME BACK
AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT

20:36.500 --> 20:38.533
BECAUSE I COULD REALLY USE
A PICK-ME-UP.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.300
OKAY, MAMA SHOWDOWN
IS NOT FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.300
BESIDES, MY PATIENT IS STABLE
AND UNTIL I'M PAGED,

20:42.333 --> 20:43.600
I'M GONNA STAY RIGHT HERE.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.167
(lowers voice) SHE KEEPS
STARING AT US.
(lowers voice) I KNOW.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.233
MAKE HER STOP.
YOU MAKE HER STOP.

20:48.267 --> 20:51.233
YOU'RE HER SISTER.
I'M AN ONLY CHILD.
YOU'RE HER RESIDENT.

20:51.267 --> 20:52.700
FINE.

20:52.733 --> 20:55.767
(normal voice)
IF YOU HAVE TIME TO STARE,

20:55.800 --> 20:58.133
YOU HAVE TIME TO GET ME COFFEE,
SO MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.367
TWO, STAY.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.600
HMM. NOW SEE?

21:01.633 --> 21:04.233
IF YOU COULD JUST DO THAT
WITH MAMA...

21:04.267 --> 21:06.133
(groans)

21:06.167 --> 21:09.233
***

21:11.267 --> 21:13.467
MRS. BURKE!

21:13.500 --> 21:15.833
I DON'T THINK I KNOW YOU.

21:15.867 --> 21:18.600
I'M GEORGE O'MALLEY.
I'M A FRIEND OF BURKE'S.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.600
I WAS BURKE'S GUY.

21:20.633 --> 21:24.133
OH. HI, GEORGE O'MALLEY--
BURKE'S FRIEND, BURKE'S GUY.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.467
PLEASE SIT.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.467
I GUESS I HAVE A MINUTE.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.367
YOU KNOW ONE TIME HE LET ME
LIVE ON HIS SOFA

21:31.400 --> 21:33.333
WHEN I HAD
NO PLACE ELSE TO STAY?

21:33.367 --> 21:37.067
HOW IS HE? IS HE... OKAY?

21:37.100 --> 21:39.733
HE'S PRESTON.
HE'S A GENTLEMAN.

21:39.767 --> 21:43.600
AND SO... HE DOESN'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

21:43.633 --> 21:48.367
AND I JUST REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.533
***

21:50.567 --> 21:54.100
MAYBE, UH... I DON'T KNOW.

21:54.133 --> 21:56.833
MAYBE YOU CAN TELL HIM
THAT HE DODGED A BULLET.

21:56.867 --> 21:59.467
I MEAN, MARRIAGE IS...

21:59.500 --> 22:02.100
ONCE YOU'RE IN, YOU'RE IN.

22:02.133 --> 22:04.733
BURKE IS SMART, YOU KNOW?

22:04.767 --> 22:06.767
HE DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.133
'CAUSE IT'S A MISTAKE THAT,
YOU KNOW,

22:10.167 --> 22:12.067
IT'S HARD TO TAKE BACK.

22:12.100 --> 22:16.367
WHICH, EVEN IF YOU WANT
TO TAKE IT BACK, YOU CAN'T.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.300
SO YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.333
ONCE YOU'RE IN, YOU'RE IN.

22:21.367 --> 22:24.733
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THAT
ENGRAVED ON YOUR WEDDING RING

22:24.767 --> 22:26.100
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED.

22:26.133 --> 22:28.333
OH, I'M ALREADY MARRIED.

22:28.367 --> 22:30.667
YOU'RE ALREADY MARRIED?

22:30.700 --> 22:33.167
GEORGE O'MALLEY--
BURKE'S FRIEND,

22:33.200 --> 22:34.767
BURKE'S GUY--

22:34.800 --> 22:37.700
STAYING IN A MARRIAGE
OUT OF OBLIGATION?

22:37.733 --> 22:40.267
THAT'S NO WAY TO LIVE.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.267
THAT'S NO WAY TO LOVE.

22:43.300 --> 22:46.367
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.300
***

22:48.333 --> 22:51.333
I DO.

22:51.367 --> 22:53.600
SOMETIMES I DO.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.500
***

22:56.533 --> 22:59.467
OH, YOUR TIMING COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.367
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

23:02.400 --> 23:04.167
YOU PAGED ME, RIGHT?
I DID.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.400
GOOD. SO ON CALL ROOM?

23:05.433 --> 23:07.100
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING

23:07.133 --> 23:09.067
MAYBE WE COULD, UH,
GO TO THE CAFETERIA.

23:09.100 --> 23:12.067
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.267
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

23:14.300 --> 23:16.533
DEREK, WE AGREED--
"S" AND "M" ONLY.
"S" AND "M"?

23:16.567 --> 23:19.500
SEX AND MOCKERY.
RIGHT, "S" AND "M." HMM.

23:19.533 --> 23:20.700
SO YOU'RE EATING LUNCH?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.400
I AM.

23:22.433 --> 23:23.733
WANT TO COME?

23:23.767 --> 23:25.433
NO.

23:25.467 --> 23:27.367
MEET ME IN THE LOBBY
AT 8:00.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.567
AND EAT YOUR DINNER FIRST.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.367
YEAH, GREAT. PERFECT.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.833
(crying)
THAT'S
A REALLY BIG NEEDLE, MAN.

23:33.867 --> 23:36.667
DO YOU HAVE TO USE
SUCH A BIG NEEDLE?
HIS I.V. CAME OUT,

23:36.700 --> 23:38.833
AND HE NEEDS TO BE HYDRATED.
OKAY, OKAY. LOOK, I'M--

23:38.867 --> 23:42.033
SHH. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, I'M JUST--I'M FREAKING
OUT A LITTLE BIT HERE.

23:42.067 --> 23:44.467
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
GET ME AN UPDATE ON MY WIFE?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.400
YOUR WIFE HAS A CRATER
IN HER ABDOMEN,

23:46.433 --> 23:48.333
SO EVEN IF
SHE DOES SURVIVE SURGERY,

23:48.367 --> 23:50.400
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG, HARD,
PAINFUL RECOVERY.
(crying continues)

23:50.433 --> 23:53.133
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?
I MEAN, SHE'S GOTTA BE OKAY.

23:53.167 --> 23:54.567
WH--BRIAN, PLEASE,
SWEETHEART, LOOK AT ME.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.233
BRIAN, OKAY, STOP CRYING.
BRIAN, PLEASE.

23:57.267 --> 23:59.767
BRIAN, STOP CRYING!
HE CAN'T STOP CRYING!

23:59.800 --> 24:00.967
(crying continues)
OKAY?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.100
HE CAN'T STOP CRYING BECAUSE
HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SHOT.

24:04.133 --> 24:06.833
HE CAN'T STOP CRYING
BECAUSE HIS BRAIN AND HIS HEART

24:06.867 --> 24:08.767
AND HIS RENAL SYSTEM
ARE ALL COMPROMISED.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.733
HE CAN'T STOP CRYING
BECAUSE HE'S IN WITHDRAWAL

24:10.767 --> 24:13.600
FROM CRYSTAL METH,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

24:13.633 --> 24:15.167
(crying continues)

24:15.200 --> 24:17.500
NO, NO.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

24:17.533 --> 24:19.233
HE WASN'T IN THE ROOM
WHEN WE WERE MAKING IT.

24:19.267 --> 24:22.100
IT WAS ALL OVER
YOUR APARTMENT, OKAY?

24:22.133 --> 24:24.833
I TESTED HIM 'CAUSE I
SMELLED IT ON HIS SKIN.
I LOVE MY SON.

24:24.867 --> 24:27.600
OKAY, WE--WE WERE BROKE.
I LOST MY JOB.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.167
BUT I DON'T USE DRUGS.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.500
AND I'M A GOOD DAD,
AND I LOVE MY FAMILY.

24:31.533 --> 24:34.667
WELL, NOW YOU CAN LOVE
YOUR FAMILY FROM JAIL.

24:34.700 --> 24:39.200
(crying continues)

24:39.233 --> 24:42.367
IT'S OKAY. COME HERE.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.133
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

24:45.167 --> 24:47.400
(crying continues)

24:48.567 --> 24:50.033
(medical instrument whirring)

24:55.733 --> 24:57.533
DR. TORRES.

24:57.567 --> 24:59.167
YEAH, CHIEF.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.200
"YEAH, CHIEF"? IS IT THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

25:02.233 --> 25:05.100
IN MY HOSPITAL, DR. TORRES,
OR THAT YOU DON'T CARE?

25:05.133 --> 25:07.667
UM, I'M SORRY.
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW.

25:07.700 --> 25:10.500
I DELEGATED THE METH LAB
SITUATION TO YOU.

25:10.533 --> 25:12.533
AND NOW ONE OF YOUR RESIDENTS
HAS BEEN ATTACKED

25:12.567 --> 25:15.333
AND A BABY IS MISSING.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I TOLD KAREV TO TAKE--

25:15.367 --> 25:17.333
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY OF YOUR EXCUSES.

25:17.367 --> 25:21.033
FINISH UP HERE. YOU BETTER
HOPE THAT BABY SHOWS UP.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.033
(clears throat)

25:30.100 --> 25:31.300
(sighs)

25:33.167 --> 25:35.067
I THINK YOU'RE A GOOD
CHIEF RESIDENT.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.367
(scoffs) WHAT?

25:37.400 --> 25:40.267
I KNOW--I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING A HARD TIME WITH IT,

25:40.300 --> 25:42.467
AND--AND THIS THING
WITH THE BABY...

25:42.500 --> 25:44.700
CLEARLY IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB,
AND I THINK YOU'RE DOING

25:44.733 --> 25:47.533
A GOOD JOB AT IT.

25:58.633 --> 26:00.533
I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

26:00.567 --> 26:01.800
WHAT?

26:01.833 --> 26:04.433
GET OUT OF MY O.R., STEVENS.

26:04.467 --> 26:06.233
NOW!

26:06.267 --> 26:08.467
***

26:08.500 --> 26:10.400
SO THE HAPPY LITTLE FAMILY
MAKES METH.

26:10.433 --> 26:13.300
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A HAPPY FAMILY.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.767
***

26:15.800 --> 26:17.333
WHAT'S WITH HER?

26:17.367 --> 26:20.233
WELL, MAMA BURKE IS HERE,
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

26:20.267 --> 26:22.600
MY GUESS IS THAT SHE'S HERE
TO KILL CRISTINA.

26:22.633 --> 26:24.667
***

26:24.700 --> 26:26.367
SHE'S HOVERING AGAIN.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.667
IF YOU'RE DONE
WITH THE CHARTS,

26:27.700 --> 26:29.567
GO FOLD SOMETHING,

26:29.600 --> 26:32.133
LIKE, YOU KNOW, SHEETS.

26:32.167 --> 26:34.067
***

26:34.100 --> 26:36.400
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?
DON'T LOOK AT HER.

26:36.433 --> 26:39.233
YOUR SISTER. SHE'S HOT.
I'M AN ONLY CHILD.

26:39.267 --> 26:41.167
(pager beeps)
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT LEXIE.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.067
OH, THE POLICE
WANT TO TALK TO ME.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.467
YOU KNOW, ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHY SHE'S HERE.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.400
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

26:48.433 --> 26:49.667
(Derek) MM-HMM.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.633
HEY.

26:50.667 --> 26:51.733
AHA.

26:51.767 --> 26:54.233
(sighs)

26:54.267 --> 26:56.600
HE'S NOT RETURNING
MY PHONE CALLS ANYMORE.

26:56.633 --> 26:58.633
HE'S DOING HIS BEST.

26:58.667 --> 26:59.767
MM-HMM.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.400
DO YOU THINK...

27:02.433 --> 27:04.667
DO YOU THINK
SHE REALLY LOVED HIM--

27:04.700 --> 27:06.200
CRISTINA?

27:06.233 --> 27:10.600
I-I THINK SHE LOVED HIM
THE BEST THAT SHE KNEW HOW.

27:10.633 --> 27:13.667
AND THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH FOR YOU EITHER?

27:13.700 --> 27:15.767
NO. IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH FOR ME EITHER.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.600
SO YOU
WOULD'VE ENDED IT, TOO?

27:22.233 --> 27:24.267
WELL... BURKE AND I ARE--

27:24.300 --> 27:26.233
ARE BUILT DIFFERENTLY.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.167
HE'S STRONGER THAN I AM.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.633
HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO...

27:30.667 --> 27:33.033
AND, UM, WE'RE NOT BUILT
THE SAME.

27:33.067 --> 27:34.133
(chuckles)

27:34.167 --> 27:36.733
HONORABLE MEN
ARE ALL BUILT THE SAME.

27:36.767 --> 27:38.667
AND YOU THINK
I'M AN HONORABLE MAN?

27:38.700 --> 27:41.133
DO YOU KNOW
WHEN TO WALK AWAY?

27:41.167 --> 27:44.633
DO YOU KNOW WHEN NOT TO TAKE
LESS THAN YOU DESERVE?

27:44.667 --> 27:48.667
IF YOU DO,
THEN YOU'RE AN HONORABLE MAN.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.600
WHEN YOU GOT INJURED
IN THE FIRE,

27:53.633 --> 27:54.800
THE SHOCK TO YOUR BODY

27:54.833 --> 27:56.567
COMBINED WITH THE DRUGS
AND THE DAMAGE--

27:56.600 --> 27:59.633
YOUR HEART SEIZED UP, AND YOU
WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST.

27:59.667 --> 28:01.700
YOU'RE ALSO BLEEDING
INTERNALLY,

28:01.733 --> 28:03.633
SO YOU NEED TO STAY
FOR OBSERVATION,

28:03.667 --> 28:05.567
WHICH MEANS
THAT YOU ARE PROBABLY

28:05.600 --> 28:07.633
ABOUT TO GO INTO WITHDRAWAL.

28:07.667 --> 28:10.567
BUT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BECAUSE
IT IS STILL QUITE POSSIBLE

28:10.600 --> 28:12.233
THAT YOU'LL NEED SURGERY.

28:13.700 --> 28:16.400
YOU GOT ANY GOOD NEWS,
DR. O'MALLEY?

28:17.800 --> 28:19.800
I WISH I COULD SAY YES.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.300
COME ON. COME ON.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.400
COME ON. COME ON.
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:27.433 --> 28:29.333
DAMN IT!

28:29.367 --> 28:31.267
HOW'S THE SURGERY
ON THE OLD GUY?

28:31.300 --> 28:32.800
FINE.
CALLIE?

28:32.833 --> 28:34.733
DAMN IT.
I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

28:34.767 --> 28:36.667
I HAVE TO FIND A BABY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

28:36.700 --> 28:38.833
A BABY WAS LOST...
(laughs) ON MY WATCH.

28:38.867 --> 28:40.767
I AM CHIEF RESIDENT.
I AM RESPONSIBLE.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.533
AND THE CHIEF, HE GAVE THIS
TO ME, AND I BLEW IT.

28:43.567 --> 28:46.433
AND--AND NOW A BABY'S MISSING.
SO NO, I'M NOT OKAY.

28:46.467 --> 28:50.500
NO. NO, YOU ARE NOT OKAY.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.700
PLUS, I THINK...

28:57.467 --> 28:59.467
I THINK MY HUSBAND'S HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.367
(sighs)

29:01.400 --> 29:03.333
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,
HE'S AN IDIOT.

29:03.367 --> 29:04.833
(scoffs)

29:04.867 --> 29:07.200
AND IF THAT'S TRUE,

29:07.233 --> 29:09.433
YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

29:09.467 --> 29:14.033
YOU KNOW, AS AN ALTERNATIVE
TO DESTROYING YOUR CAREER.

29:19.133 --> 29:22.433
UM, DR. GREY... (chuckles)
I WAS WONDERING,

29:22.467 --> 29:25.033
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE THERMOMETERS ARE? 'CAUSE--

29:25.067 --> 29:27.300
DO YOU REALLY NOT KNOW WHERE
THE THERMOMETERS ARE, LEXIE?

29:27.333 --> 29:29.467
OR ARE YOU JUST LOOKING
FOR AN EXCUSE TO TALK TO ME?

29:29.500 --> 29:31.167
I--
SIMPLE QUESTION, LEXIE.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.233
ARE YOU AN IDIOT
OR A STALKER?

29:36.267 --> 29:37.633
OKAY.

29:37.667 --> 29:40.133
(sighs) THAT WAS
A MEAN THING TO SAY.

29:40.167 --> 29:41.467
I'M AWARE OF THAT

29:41.500 --> 29:43.400
BECAUSE I'M GENERALLY
NOT A MEAN PERSON.

29:43.433 --> 29:46.233
BUT I'M A PERSON WHO JUST
DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW YOU.

29:46.267 --> 29:49.167
AND YOU ARE A PERSON WHO'S
MAKING THAT VERY DIFFICULT.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.467
SO PLEASE, JUST STOP
MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT

29:51.500 --> 29:53.400
FOR ME TO NOT KNOW YOU.

29:53.433 --> 29:55.033
OKAY?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.100
(Dave) BRIAN, OH, MY GOD.

30:05.133 --> 30:08.233
PLEASE, WAKE UP, BABY.
PLEASE.

30:08.267 --> 30:09.767
PLEASE WAKE UP.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.233
PLEASE.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.567
MR. KRISTLER.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.600
HE WON'T WAKE UP.
HE WAS SHAKING,

30:14.633 --> 30:17.200
AND THEN HE JUST--HE JUST--
HE WON'T WAKE UP.

30:17.233 --> 30:20.067
LET ME TAKE HIM, MR. KRISTLER.
NO, I LOVE MY BABY.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MY BABY.

30:20.100 --> 30:23.167
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE HAD A SEIZURE.
OKAY, PLEASE LET ME--
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.367
YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO DIE,

30:24.400 --> 30:26.467
SO IF YOU LOVE HIM,
PLEASE LET ME TAKE HIM.
I'M SORRY!

30:26.500 --> 30:28.400
LET ME TAKE HIM. NURSE!
BABY, PLEASE.

30:33.367 --> 30:34.367
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:35.733 --> 30:37.633
HE HAD A STROKE.

30:37.667 --> 30:41.067
A 1 YEAR OLD
WITH A STROKE.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.433
YOU CAN YELL, YOU KNOW?

30:44.467 --> 30:45.800
NOT MY JOB ANYMORE.

30:45.833 --> 30:48.700
I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU CAN IF YOU WANT.

30:48.733 --> 30:50.500
I-I DESERVE IT.

30:50.533 --> 30:51.700
OH, YOU DO DESERVE IT.

30:51.733 --> 30:53.633
YOU DO DESERVE, DR. KAREV,
TO BE CHASTISED

30:53.667 --> 30:57.133
FOR YOUR STUNNINGLY POOR
DECISION MAKING.

30:57.167 --> 30:59.700
YOU--YOU'VE CERTAINLY EARNED
A-A REPRIMAND

30:59.733 --> 31:03.733
FOR YOUR UNBELIEVABLY
DESTRUCTIVE TACTICAL ERROR.

31:06.733 --> 31:09.633
YOU GOT IN THE FACE
OF A DRUG DEALER?

31:09.667 --> 31:11.567
YOU GOT IN THE FACE OF
A DRUG DEALER

31:11.600 --> 31:13.133
BEFORE THE POLICE HAD ARRI--

31:13.167 --> 31:15.100
YOU GOT IN THE FACE
OF A KNOWN FELON

31:15.133 --> 31:17.533
WHILE HIS 1-YEAR-OLD CHILD
WAS STILL IN THE ROOM?

31:17.567 --> 31:19.467
ARE YOU STUPID?
ARE YOU WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE?

31:19.500 --> 31:22.100
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WERE
TAUGHT BETTER THAN THAT.

31:22.133 --> 31:24.033
I TAUGHT YOU BETTER
THAN THAT, DR. KAREV.

31:24.067 --> 31:26.633
GETTIN' IN THE FACE
OF A DRUG DEALER. FOOL.

31:29.300 --> 31:30.467
THANK YOU.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.800
OH, NO. THANK YOU.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.800
I AM A NICE PERSON.

31:43.833 --> 31:45.700
OKAY, I-I AM.

31:45.733 --> 31:49.200
AND... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS THAT I DID TO YOU,

31:49.233 --> 31:52.233
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE THE SAME DAD.

31:52.267 --> 31:54.400
SO I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT A SIMPLE CONVERSATION--

31:54.433 --> 31:56.333
WE DON'T HAVE
THE SAME DAD, LEXIE.

31:56.367 --> 31:59.800
YOU AND I,
WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME DAD.

31:59.833 --> 32:02.833
MY DAD DISAPPEARED
WHEN I WAS 5 YEARS OLD,

32:02.867 --> 32:04.767
AND I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

32:04.800 --> 32:09.167
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE
THE DADDY YOU GREW UP WITH?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.033
I KICKED A MAN
OUT OF MY BED

32:11.067 --> 32:12.800
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT--

32:12.833 --> 32:15.533
THE WORLD'S MOST PERFECT MAN,
WHO LOVES ME,

32:15.567 --> 32:17.200
AND I CAN'T LET HIM.

32:17.233 --> 32:20.300
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A SHRINK
TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

32:20.333 --> 32:22.533
BECAUSE OUR DAD CHOSE YOU.

32:22.567 --> 32:25.767
SO I'M SURE YOU ARE
A VERY NICE GIRL, LEXIE.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.700
BUT I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND,

32:27.733 --> 32:31.500
YOU'RE NOT A GIRL I EVER WANTED
TO HAVE TO KNOW.

32:39.433 --> 32:42.600
(panting) I NEVER EVEN
TRIED DRUGS UNTIL I WAS 30.

32:42.633 --> 32:46.033
STUPID. I'M SO STUPID.

32:46.067 --> 32:48.200
I WENT TO A PARTY,
AND THERE WAS ALL THIS--

32:48.233 --> 32:49.733
THIS METH FLOATING AROUND AND...

32:49.767 --> 32:52.633
I JUST FIGURED, WHAT THE HECK?
ONCE WON'T KILL YOU.

32:52.667 --> 32:54.800
AND THEN--
AND THEN IT'S MORE THAN ONCE,

32:54.833 --> 32:57.133
THEN IT'S ALL
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT,

32:57.167 --> 32:59.267
AND THEN--THEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE
YOUR DEALER'S HOUSE

32:59.300 --> 33:00.800
AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.500
THIS ISN'T ME. IT--IT ISN'T.
I'M NOT THIS GUY.

33:02.533 --> 33:05.633
I'M--I'M NOT THIS GUY.
I'M NOT THIS GUY. (gasps)

33:05.667 --> 33:06.833
(monitor beeping erratically)

33:06.867 --> 33:08.767
CLARK?

33:14.400 --> 33:15.767
(clears throat)

33:15.800 --> 33:17.233
HELLO.

33:17.267 --> 33:19.133
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

33:19.167 --> 33:20.667
YES.

33:20.700 --> 33:23.033
WELL?

33:23.067 --> 33:24.433
I CAME FOR PRESTON'S KEY.

33:24.467 --> 33:26.367
I'D LIKE TO PICK UP
SOME OF HIS THINGS

33:26.400 --> 33:29.233
AND THE NECKLACE I GAVE YOU
FOR THE WEDDING.

33:29.267 --> 33:30.333
OH, YEAH. OF--OF COURSE.

33:30.367 --> 33:32.233
(keys jangle)

33:32.267 --> 33:35.133
JUST, UH, LEAVE IT
UNDER THE MAT WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

33:35.167 --> 33:37.100
OKAY.

33:37.133 --> 33:39.400
AND I WANTED TO SAY
I'M SORRY.

33:39.433 --> 33:42.400
I...

33:42.433 --> 33:44.333
I'VE COME TO KNOW YOU,
I THINK.

33:44.367 --> 33:47.367
AND WHAT YOU LOVE
EVEN MORE THAN PRESTON

33:47.400 --> 33:49.167
IS BEING A SURGEON.

33:49.200 --> 33:53.733
YOU ARE PLANNING TO CONTINUE
WITH CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

33:53.767 --> 33:55.767
LIKE MY SON,
AM I CORRECT?

33:55.800 --> 33:57.733
YES.

33:57.767 --> 34:00.733
SO I'M SORRY YOU LOST
THE MAN YOU LOVE.

34:00.767 --> 34:04.733
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
I'M SORRY YOU LOST YOUR TEACHER.

34:04.767 --> 34:07.533
WITH HIM BY YOUR SIDE...

34:07.567 --> 34:11.367
YOU COULD'VE BECOME
A BRILLIANT HEART SURGEON.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.367
***

34:14.400 --> 34:16.200
I SEE.

34:16.233 --> 34:18.133
YOU'RE A STRONG WOMAN,
CRISTINA.

34:18.167 --> 34:20.533
I RESPECT THAT.

34:20.567 --> 34:24.700
I WISH I COULD'VE BEEN BORN
AT ANOTHER TIME.

34:24.733 --> 34:27.767
I MIGHT BE MORE LIKE YOU.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.467
***

34:30.500 --> 34:35.133
SO I SHALL LEAVE THE KEY
UNDER THE MAT.

34:35.167 --> 34:38.367
UH, CAN YOU TAKE
THE GIFTS?

34:38.400 --> 34:40.300
THERE ARE
ALL THESE WEDDING GIFTS,

34:40.333 --> 34:41.633
AND I CAN'T...

34:41.667 --> 34:43.633
CAN YOU--CAN YOU PLEASE
TAKE THEM AWAY?

34:43.667 --> 34:45.800
OF COURSE I CAN.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.800
HE'S NEVER COMING BACK,
IS HE?

34:48.833 --> 34:52.667
NOT EVEN TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

34:52.700 --> 34:56.500
REMEMBER...
YOU'RE A STRONG WOMAN.

34:56.533 --> 35:00.033
***

35:14.133 --> 35:16.067
HIS HEART COULDN'T TAKE IT.

35:16.100 --> 35:18.200
THERE WAS JUST
TOO MUCH DAMAGE.

35:18.233 --> 35:21.000
HE COULDN'T TAKE IT.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.767
I'M NOT THIS GUY.

35:24.800 --> 35:28.133
I WON'T BE THIS GUY WHO...

35:28.167 --> 35:30.367
I'M GOING TO TELL HER.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.267
(Callie) OH, CHIEF.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.633
I, UH--

35:35.667 --> 35:37.167
I'VE GOT PAPERWORK,
DR. TORRES.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.500
KIDNAPPED BABIES MAKE FOR
A LOT OF PAPERWORK.

35:39.533 --> 35:42.400
I WAS PLANNING ON MAYBE
GOING TO SEE MY WIFE TONIGHT.

35:42.433 --> 35:44.367
BUT INSTEAD,
I GET TO DO THIS.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.733
I COULD HELP.

35:45.767 --> 35:47.667
I MEAN, I-I COULD--
I COULD HELP.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.700
NO, YOU'VE HELPED ENOUGH
FOR ONE DAY.

35:51.700 --> 35:53.600
OH, WHAT...

35:53.633 --> 35:54.767
MM.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.767
WHAT...

35:57.800 --> 36:00.033
H-HOW DID I GET...

36:00.067 --> 36:03.233
YOU WERE COOKING CRYSTAL METH
AND THE SUBSTANCES EXPLODED.

36:03.267 --> 36:05.100
OH.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.033
WHERE'S--WHERE'S MY--

36:09.067 --> 36:11.667
YOUR HUSBAND AND YOUR SON, UH,
SUSTAINED ONLY MINOR INJURIES.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.200
ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS, UM,

36:13.233 --> 36:16.500
YOUR SON HAD BEEN PASSIVELY
INGESTING METHAMPHETAMINE.

36:16.533 --> 36:18.833
HE SUFFERED A STROKE
EARLIER TODAY

36:18.867 --> 36:21.233
AND WENT INTO SURGERY
THIS AFTERNOON.

36:21.267 --> 36:23.167
I BELIEVE THE SURGERY
WENT SMOOTHLY.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.100
YOUR HUSBAND
WAS TAKEN BY THE POLICE,

36:25.133 --> 36:28.700
AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE WANTING
TO SPEAK TO YOU AS WELL.

36:28.733 --> 36:32.033
(crying)

36:32.067 --> 36:33.800
OH, OKAY.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:33.833 --> 36:35.500
JUST TRY--TRY TO BREATHE.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.200
SLOWLY.

36:37.233 --> 36:40.467
SLOWLY. BREATHE.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.100
I'M SURE IT MUST FEEL...

36:43.133 --> 36:45.333
AS THOUGH EVERYTHING
IS COMING APART.

36:45.367 --> 36:48.200
BUT YOU CAN GET THROUGH THIS.

36:48.233 --> 36:50.200
JUST... BREATHE.

36:50.233 --> 36:53.100
(crying continues)

36:53.133 --> 36:55.367
***

36:55.400 --> 36:57.300
BREATHE.

36:57.333 --> 37:00.467
THE THING ABOUT ADDICTION IS
IT NEVER ENDS WELL.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.267
***

37:02.300 --> 37:04.067
BECAUSE EVENTUALLY

37:04.100 --> 37:07.367
WHATEVER IT IS
THAT WAS GETTING US HIGH...

37:07.400 --> 37:10.267
***

37:10.300 --> 37:13.267
STOPS FEELING GOOD

37:13.300 --> 37:14.800
AND STARTS TO HURT.

37:14.833 --> 37:18.067
(Mark)
WANT TO GRAB A DRINK?

37:18.100 --> 37:19.500
(sighs)

37:19.533 --> 37:20.700
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

37:20.733 --> 37:23.400
WHAT'S UP?

37:23.433 --> 37:26.500
NO, I'M JUST...

37:26.533 --> 37:28.567
I'M ADMITTING I...

37:28.600 --> 37:31.100
***

37:31.133 --> 37:32.333
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

37:32.367 --> 37:36.267
***

37:40.733 --> 37:43.333
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM
AND THE BABY?

37:43.367 --> 37:45.400
UM...

37:45.433 --> 37:48.233
HIS GRANDMOTHER
IS COMING FOR HIM.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.567
I THINK SHE'S GONNA
TAKE CUSTODY.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.333
(chuckles) THEY WERE IT.

37:53.367 --> 37:56.333
THEY WERE MY FAMILY.

37:56.367 --> 37:58.767
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

37:58.800 --> 38:02.467
AFTER 60 YEARS ON THIS PLANET...

38:02.500 --> 38:04.400
MY FAMILY'S
A COUPLE OF DRUG DEALERS

38:04.433 --> 38:06.500
AND THEIR KID.

38:06.533 --> 38:09.533
***

38:14.533 --> 38:17.133
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE
PEOPLE DO HORRIBLE THINGS,

38:17.167 --> 38:20.167
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN
THEY'RE HORRIBLE PEOPLE.

38:20.200 --> 38:23.333
***

38:26.800 --> 38:29.667
STILL, THEY SAY
YOU DON'T KICK THE HABIT

38:29.700 --> 38:31.733
TILL YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM.

38:31.767 --> 38:35.100
***

38:35.133 --> 38:37.033
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE THERE?

38:37.067 --> 38:39.467
SO I TAKE IT
YOU STILL WANT TO TALK?

38:39.500 --> 38:41.233
YEAH, I DO. I--

38:41.267 --> 38:42.633
NO.

38:42.667 --> 38:44.833
NO, I--

38:44.867 --> 38:46.567
NO, YOU DON'T.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.300
GEORGE, PLEASE. JUST...

38:50.700 --> 38:52.767
PLEASE,
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.733
PLEASE. I AM ASKING YOU
AS YOUR WIFE.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.200
I AM ASKING YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.

38:57.233 --> 38:59.633
I AM ASKING YOU TO JUST NOT.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.500
NOT TONIGHT.

39:01.533 --> 39:05.300
I AM YOUR WIFE.

39:05.333 --> 39:09.633
DO THIS FOR ME?

39:09.667 --> 39:12.800
***

39:17.767 --> 39:19.667
OKAY.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.767
***

39:27.467 --> 39:29.400
DR. GREY.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.667
I'M HEADING OVER TO JOE'S.
YOU WANT TO GRAB A DRINK?

39:31.700 --> 39:33.767
OH, NO, THANKS.
I'M, UH, MEETING SOMEONE.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.733
YEAH. DEREK ASKED ME
TO TRACK YOU DOWN.

39:36.767 --> 39:39.633
HE'S, UH,
STUCK WITH A PATIENT.

39:39.667 --> 39:41.567
NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO MEET YOU.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.267
SENDS HIS APOLOGIES.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.633
(Meredith) OH, OKAY.

39:44.667 --> 39:47.567
SO... JOE'S?

39:47.600 --> 39:49.733
I THINK I'M GOING HOME.

39:49.767 --> 39:52.767
***

39:58.233 --> 39:59.400
MEREDITH.

39:59.433 --> 40:01.133
***

40:01.167 --> 40:05.033
BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW BADLY
A THING IS HURTING US...

40:05.067 --> 40:08.067
***

40:09.500 --> 40:13.367
SOMETIMES LETTING IT GO
HURTS EVEN WORSE.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.400
***

40:31.700 --> 40:34.700
***
