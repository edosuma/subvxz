00:13.472 --> 00:15.224
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:15.307 --> 00:18.227
<i>to announce</i>
<i>this year's Oscar nominees...</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:20.896
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter!</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:28.320
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter!</i>

00:30.322 --> 00:32.574
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter?</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:37.704
Hello! Here I am, Mr. Peanutbutter.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.623
That's my name and I am here.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.085
Okay, the nominees.
Nominees for Oscar.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.711
Who are the nominees?

00:44.795 --> 00:48.090
Well, as I used to say
on <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:51.218
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,</i>

00:51.301 --> 00:52.803
let's find out.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.555
For Best Actor, the nominees are:

00:54.638 --> 00:57.891
Jurj Clooners
for <i>The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.</i>

00:57.975 --> 01:00.060
Bread Poot for <i>City of AIDS.</i>

01:00.143 --> 01:01.979
Colin Firth for <i>First Things Firth:</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:03.272
<i>The Colin Firth Story.</i>

01:03.355 --> 01:06.400
Michael Fassbender for...
I want to say <i>Bill Gates?</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:09.444
And BoJack Horseman for <i>Secretariat.</i>

01:11.989 --> 01:13.240
Whoa.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.243
BoJack, you just got nominated
for an Oscar.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.662
You're an Oscar nominee.
How do you feel?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.122
I feel...

01:20.789 --> 01:22.457
I-I feel...

01:22.749 --> 01:24.042
I feel...

01:25.210 --> 01:26.253
the same.

01:28.672 --> 01:35.345
<i>♪♪</i>

02:20.932 --> 02:23.977
It happened again. Why do I keep
thinking things will make me happy?

02:24.061 --> 02:26.772
-What is wrong with me?
-BoJack, don't do this.

02:26.855 --> 02:31.318
-Don't fetishize your own sadness.
-Uh... Oh, God, I'm drowning.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.488
-I feel like I'm drowning.
-BoJack, listen.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.575
When I was 17,
I snuck out to a fraternity party.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.703
<i>The roads were icy</i>
<i>and I swerved into the lake.</i>

02:44.706 --> 02:46.625
<i>I came to underwater.</i>

02:46.708 --> 02:50.796
<i>It was dark and cold,</i>
<i>and I didn't even know which way was up.</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:54.341
<i>I thought for sure I was going to drown.</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:57.511
<i>And then... I noticed...</i>

02:58.053 --> 03:01.932
<i>when I opened my mouth,</i>
<i>the air bubbles floated up,</i>

03:02.015 --> 03:04.601
<i>and that's how I knew</i>
<i>which way to swim.</i>

03:06.228 --> 03:07.729
That is a terrifying story.

03:07.813 --> 03:11.566
BoJack, when you find yourself lost
and disoriented and underwater

03:11.650 --> 03:13.693
and you don't know which way is up,

03:13.777 --> 03:15.695
it's important to breathe.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.199
I don't deserve this.
I'm not a best actor.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.660
Awards aren't about who's best, BoJack.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.662
That's literally the only thing
they're about.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.665
No. All this means is that
you're one of the special people.

03:26.748 --> 03:30.836
I saw it the first time I met you.
You must have known it all your life.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.463
And all your life, people told you
that you were wrong,

03:33.547 --> 03:37.092
that you weren't special,
that you were just like everybody else.

03:37.175 --> 03:42.806
But now, the special people are saying,
"You were right, BoJack. You were right."

03:42.889 --> 03:46.017
I was right.
I am one of the special people.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.353
-Yes.
-What are we doing just sitting here?

03:48.437 --> 03:49.938
I just got nominated for an Oscar.

03:50.021 --> 03:55.485
We gotta party like it's 1982,
the year Prince released <i>1999.</i>

04:03.452 --> 04:04.953
Whoo-hoo!

04:05.036 --> 04:06.747
<i>♪ Go, go, go... ♪</i>

04:18.175 --> 04:21.011
BoJack, your complimentary Rolex is here.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.056
BoJack, giant chocolate Oscar's here.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.977
Famous DJ David Gu-etta is at the door.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.773
Free Tesla's here, Boj. They want to know
if they can park it in your driveway.

04:32.856 --> 04:33.774
No.

04:33.857 --> 04:37.736
Tell them I want my free Tesla parked
in my goddamn living room. I'm BoJack!

04:45.494 --> 04:49.122
Yeah, now we're doing it!
Look at us partying.

04:51.082 --> 04:55.170
BoJack, you got another delivery.
Someone sent a... nerd?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.588
Hi.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.510
You get a load
of this chili cheese fountain?

05:01.593 --> 05:05.263
-Grab a handful of beans and go to town.
-Hey, this is all really something.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.557
But I actually just came
because I heard about the nomination

05:07.641 --> 05:08.975
and I wanted to make sure you're okay.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.977
That's a funny way
of saying congratulations.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.980
But not funny "ha-ha",
more like funny <i>Doonesbury.</i>

05:14.064 --> 05:16.817
I know how this kind of thing
can sometimes send you spinning.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.903
"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me happy?
Will anything make me happy?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.822
I'm an empty husk." That kind of thing.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.990
Well, thank you for that,
but I'm actually doing great.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.369
I direct your attention to
the aforementioned chili cheese fountain!

05:29.996 --> 05:32.457
It's too bad I'm not managing
your social campaign anymore,

05:32.541 --> 05:34.626
because this party would make
a great Snapchat story.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.087
You are not gonna make me guilty
about leaving Princess Carolyn.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.297
I'm not here to make you feel guilty.
Like I said--

05:39.381 --> 05:41.091
Honestly, I don't even know
what you're doing over there.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.927
-Tweeting for celebrities?
-Well, actually, I don't--

05:44.010 --> 05:46.304
When I met you, you were
so cool and interesting--

05:46.388 --> 05:47.514
Uh, I was never cool.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.849
You used to actually care about shit.
What happened?

05:49.933 --> 05:52.894
I don't know, BoJack.
Maybe caring about shit got old.

05:52.978 --> 05:56.606
Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at me
and sending death threats to my house,

05:56.690 --> 05:59.734
and all my friends thinking I'm annoying,
and getting in fights with my husband,

05:59.818 --> 06:02.946
and seeing little refugee boys
die in hospital bombings.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.032
It's exhausting and I can't do it.
If that makes me a bad person,

06:06.116 --> 06:08.368
then I'm sorry that I'm not
the "cool, interesting girl."

06:08.451 --> 06:11.621
I never said you were a bad person.
I just said it's not you.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.998
And you know it's not you.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.625
Oh, and this party is you?
Who are all these people?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.419
-These are my friends.
-Name one of them.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.171
-Tes-ley.
-You're just looking at the Tesla.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.465
I don't know why it's so hard for you
to believe that I could be happy.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.883
I'm not like you, okay?

06:23.967 --> 06:28.888
-I don't fetishize my own sadness.
-I don't fetishize my own sadness.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.852
-Sure.
-You don't know anything about me.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.354
Hey!

06:36.438 --> 06:38.481
I know that you can tweet for a living

06:38.565 --> 06:40.609
in a house in Beverly Hills
that your husband bought,

06:40.692 --> 06:43.653
or you can think you're better
than everyone, but you can't do both.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.741
-I don't think I'm better than everyone.
-And again, I say, sure.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.825
You know what's gonna happen?

06:48.908 --> 06:51.828
You're gonna win that Oscar,
and you're gonna go up on that stage

06:51.911 --> 06:54.873
and give your little speech,
and then you're gonna go home.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.542
And you're gonna be so miserable,
you'll want to kill yourself.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.878
And you're gonna have nobody left
to stop you.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.590
Hey, it's BoJack!

07:03.673 --> 07:04.924
BoJack! BoJack!

07:05.008 --> 07:07.677
No one's gonna be there
when I kill myself?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.888
Listen to that chanting, Diane.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.681
The chanting don't lie.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.018
There's going to be plenty
of people around when I kill myself.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.186
BoJack!

07:16.269 --> 07:19.064
Tell your readers
that BoJack was sleeping.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.775
He didn't even know
they were announced today.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.194
Okay. Goodbye, Heather.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.113
-Hey, Ana, can I ask you something?
-Of course, darling.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.033
-So, if I win the Oscar--
-"When" you win the Oscar.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.911
Right. But after that,
what's gonna happen to us?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.621
-What do you mean?
-What we have.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.873
It's more than
just an Oscar campaign, right?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.041
-I need to go.
-What?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.209
There's work to be done.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.420
We got the nomination,
but now, the real battle begins.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.715
Enjoy your party.
Stop worrying about the future.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.450
Come on, buddy! Come on!

08:15.578 --> 08:17.580
-Mr. Peanutbutter!
-Thank God you're okay.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.124
Better than okay. I'm wonderful.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.543
Thanks to you, you wonderful man.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.295
When you said my name this morning,
you changed my life.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.256
-About that--
-Hey, did you see Erica here?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.341
She was looking for you earlier,
with her good eye.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.301
Her other eye was looking to the stars.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.430
-BoJack, I need to talk to you.
-Yeah? What's going on, buddy?

08:33.513 --> 08:36.850
Well, I've got good news
and I've got bad news.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.112
Raven on a wire.
A gloomy portent, precariously perched.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.491
And, as the sun sets,
so does it spread its deathly shadow

08:53.575 --> 08:57.912
across the just and unjust
of the outdoor seating area

08:57.996 --> 09:00.206
of the California Pizza Kitchen.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.251
Mm-hmm! And what better way
to view such disquieting omens

09:03.334 --> 09:05.962
than through these gorgeous
floor-to-ceiling windows?

09:06.046 --> 09:10.508
Yeah. Wow! They really make
regular windows look like shit.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.720
I can't look out the window
while lying on the floor?

09:13.803 --> 09:17.515
-No, thank you, regular window!
-Tell me a little about your company.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.060
Well, it started as a safe space
for women.

09:20.143 --> 09:20.977
Ooh!

09:21.061 --> 09:24.898
Then, it became a safe space
for women and men.

09:24.981 --> 09:25.857
Oh!

09:25.940 --> 09:28.860
Now, it's more
of a safe-ish space for women...

09:28.943 --> 09:29.778
Mm-hmm.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.781
...and a really safe space
for men to look at women...

09:32.864 --> 09:33.698
I hear you.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.658
...while also being driven around by them.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.162
-Wow! Something for everyone.
-Demand is skyrocketing.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.164
That's why we need a bigger office space.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.832
You come to work, clock in,

09:42.916 --> 09:44.292
you put sugar in your coffee,

09:44.375 --> 09:47.587
and watch it slowly disappear
into nothingness.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.673
But the sugar doesn't know why.
Sugar didn't ask to be born.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.591
Is he okay?

09:51.674 --> 09:53.885
He recently found out
that his brother's sick.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.513
Oh. I'm so sorry,
but you know what else is sick?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.681
-These hardwood floors.
-Ooh!

09:58.765 --> 10:00.975
Did you hear that, Mr. Peanutbutter?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.817
Losing BoJack was a blow.
There's no way to sugarcoat it,

10:08.900 --> 10:11.611
even if I were generally good
at sugarcoating things, which I'm not.

10:11.694 --> 10:15.073
You know, I wish
cats really did have nine lives.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.951
It would make me feel better
about how much I'm screwing up this one.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.285
You're not screwing up your life.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.330
Sometimes I feel like,
if I could start everything over,

10:22.413 --> 10:25.583
knowing what I know now,
I'd do it all right this time.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.502
But other times I think...

10:27.585 --> 10:28.962
No, I wouldn't.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.258
As you all know, things have been rough,

10:33.341 --> 10:35.927
and, unfortunately,
we have to scale back our staff.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.680
-Mainly, you.
-Are you firing me?

10:38.763 --> 10:40.557
In a sense, yes.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.976
But, in another sense,
I'm promoting you

10:43.059 --> 10:45.562
to a position of finding a job
somewhere else.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.941
Yeah. I don't think I ever thanked you
for giving me this job in the first place.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.985
It was an honor to work with you.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.738
You were the worst social media
coordinator this company ever had.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.828
Are you sure you need surgery?
Can't you get a second opinion?

11:01.911 --> 11:05.039
Second opinion? You know
there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.417
I could ask him twice
if it'd make you feel better.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.419
Nothing could make me
feel better right now.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.463
Not even an amazing career opportunity.
Hold on, I'm getting another call.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.758
I've got to take this. It could be
an amazing career opportunity. Hello?

11:15.842 --> 11:18.386
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is Shep Von Trapp,

11:18.469 --> 11:19.804
awards show producer,

11:19.888 --> 11:21.639
with a career opportunity

11:21.723 --> 11:25.226
that is... good.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.186
This isn't a great time, Shep.
Could you call back?

11:27.270 --> 11:28.688
Absolutely... not.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.817
The Oscar nomination announcement
is in seven days and we don't have a host.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.278
Sadly, Jimmy Fallon just broke his face.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.947
What? Halloween in January?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.074
What a crazy concept! I can't believe it!

11:40.158 --> 11:42.160
I mean, what is this?
Barry Gibb would be like...

11:42.243 --> 11:44.120
<i>♪ I'm going in! ♪</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:46.956
No. First, I gotta get a selfie
with this thing.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.459
I'm Jimmy Fallon--

11:50.960 --> 11:52.545
<i>Und</i> you are our first choice

11:52.629 --> 11:55.298
after our first "first choice"
got hit by a bus.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.176
You're our second "first choice."
What do you say?

11:58.259 --> 12:01.888
Ooh, a job like that? You want
a fully present presenter to present.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.681
And I don't know
if I've got the pep in my step

12:03.765 --> 12:05.892
to take that show
where it needs to go, you know?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.393
I've got a real pepless step, Shep.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.063
Okay, well, let me know,
because if you don't want to do it,

12:10.146 --> 12:12.899
we'll probably just post the list
of nominees online or something.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.192
It's really not that big of a deal.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.986
Hey, sorry about that.
Just got a call from the Oscars.

12:17.070 --> 12:21.157
-They want me to host--
-They want you to host the Oscars?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.575
Nomination announcement.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.202
But I don't think
I have it in me right now.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.412
Are you kidding?
You gotta take that gig.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.414
-Really?
-Mr. Peanutbutter...

12:28.498 --> 12:30.917
what did Nana Peanutbutter always say?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.294
"Always take every opportunity
that comes your way

12:33.378 --> 12:35.922
because opportunities
are like sneezes from God,

12:36.005 --> 12:38.508
and when God sneezes,
you can't say 'God bless you' to God,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.343
so instead you have
to take the opportunity.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.470
I'm cold. Will you pass me that blanket?"

12:42.553 --> 12:44.973
Boy, that old gal had something
for everything, didn't she?

12:45.056 --> 12:46.599
I know you're worried about me,

12:46.683 --> 12:49.686
but sitting around the house worrying
isn't going to help anyone.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.105
Okay, but you'll call me
when you get out of the surgery, right?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.940
I'm not gonna let my phone leave my sight.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.276
Of course. And now,
I've got something new to live for.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.698
My little brother, telling the whole world
who got an Oscar!

13:01.781 --> 13:03.157
Nomination.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.038
We are minutes away.
Shep, release the envelope.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.207
Copy that. Releasing the envelope.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.710
It's go time.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.130
It's go time.

13:17.213 --> 13:21.134
-Are you ready, Brother Pricewater?
-Of course, Brother Housecoopers.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.019
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we'd like to invite you to the stage.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.688
It's here! The golden envelope.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.566
-Hmm...
-<i>Herr</i> Peanutbutter?

13:36.649 --> 13:39.193
Okay. Oh, my phone.
What should I do with it, Todd?

13:39.277 --> 13:40.445
-Maybe you should hold it.
-Uh-huh.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.654
-No, I'll take it with me.
-All right.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.031
-No, you hold it.
-Sure thing, yeah.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.949
-No, put it in my jacket pocket.
-Right here. Okay.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.952
Oh, no, it's a fake pocket.
Tricked again!

13:48.036 --> 13:49.620
Todd, it's ringing. This is it.

13:49.704 --> 13:50.830
Oh, no, my phone!

13:50.913 --> 13:53.624
Oh, no, I kicked it, right through
that doorway into the hallway!

13:53.708 --> 13:56.586
Now, other people are kicking it
and it's sliding across the floor!

13:56.669 --> 13:59.005
-Okay, this is getting absurd.
-Let's get that phone!

13:59.088 --> 14:02.633
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you have been invited to the stage!

14:02.717 --> 14:05.011

-Mr. Peanutbutter.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.553
I just, um... I wanted to give you
a chance to say goodbye...

14:47.637 --> 14:49.972
-Oh, no.
-...to my twisted spleen.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.975
Because it was successfully removed
from my body!

14:53.059 --> 14:54.727
Oh, my God, that's incredible!

14:54.811 --> 14:58.064
Now, get out there
and announce those Oscars!

14:58.147 --> 15:00.149
Nominations. You got it, buddy.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.568
Okay. Now, where's the... the...

15:02.652 --> 15:05.405
Uh-oh. Could've sworn it was right here.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.697
Oh!

15:06.781 --> 15:09.909
Oh! There you are.
You need to get on stage.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.871
Yes, just as soon as you give me that
backup envelope, please and <i>por favor.</i>

15:13.955 --> 15:16.374
What back-up envelope?
There is no back-up envelope.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.252
That was a test and you passed.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.878
<i>Wunderbar.</i>
Now, let's get you out there.

15:20.962 --> 15:25.216
Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage,
to announce the nominations.

15:25.299 --> 15:28.052
Just as soon as I--
Oh, my God, is that Bradley Cooper?

15:28.136 --> 15:30.513
Bradley Cooper?
We love him for some reason.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.181
-Where?
-Let's go, Todd.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.184
-Oh, God, what do we do?
-It's okay.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.562
We just need to come up
with all the nominees ourselves.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.605
But I haven't even seen all the movies.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.358
Todd, nobody has.
That's not how they give out awards.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.734
-But--
-Time for talk is over.

15:43.818 --> 15:44.902
Now's the time for action.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.989
And by "action," I mean
talking about these 24 categories

15:48.072 --> 15:49.949
until we've settled on a list of nominees.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.076
You need to tell me right now,
are you in or out?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.619
Well, when you put it that way,

15:53.703 --> 15:56.914
I guess you can call me
high-waisted denim,

15:56.998 --> 15:59.834
because, right now, I am very in.

15:59.917 --> 16:00.835
Let's do this.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.296
What did you think of Frieda Pinto?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.756
Are you kidding me?
Anybody could do what she did.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.719
"Don't take my baby.
I'll give you all my Bitcoins!"

16:09.802 --> 16:11.387
Wow. That is good.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.348
Okay, for Best Picture,
what about <i>Avatar?</i>

16:14.432 --> 16:17.852
-That was a good movie.
-True, but did that come out this year?

16:17.935 --> 16:20.688
-I feel like I just saw it.
-Well, there's no way to know for sure.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.981
Let's just throw it on the list.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.485
Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis
down for anything? He's always there.

16:25.568 --> 16:26.903
Good catch! I'll add him.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.029
Daniel Day-Lewis.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.492
Okay. We need one more nominee
for Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?

16:32.575 --> 16:35.244
His performance in <i>Secretariat</i>
was as thoughtful and self-aware

16:35.328 --> 16:36.329
as we've ever seen him.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.414
-Besides, he's our friend.
-Is he?

16:38.498 --> 16:42.001
Whoa! I am surprised to hear
you say that, Todd Chavez.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.545
-Let's dig into that. We have time.
-I don't think we do.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.589
You're supposed to be
announcing these, like, now.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.091
There is always time
to talk about our feelings.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.177
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,

16:51.260 --> 16:53.054
"There's always time
to talk about feelings,

16:53.137 --> 16:55.556
because feelings
are the ceilings of our hearts,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.392
and a leaky feeling ceiling
leads to a flood of blood.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.520
And I'm cold.
Will you pass me that blanket?"

17:00.603 --> 17:04.899
Well, I guess I'm just tired
of BoJack walking all over everybody

17:04.982 --> 17:07.652
and still getting everything he wants.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.987
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think
the important thing to remember here

17:10.071 --> 17:12.573
is that BoJack is a damaged individual,

17:12.657 --> 17:16.911
struggling against a sea of demons,
many self-created, but still all too real.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.747
Getting this nomination
from the two friends he loves the most--

17:19.830 --> 17:22.500
you and also me--
would really mean a lot to him.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.085
Okay.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.337
But did you really think
he was that good in the movie?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.048
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.469
And the final nominee
for Best Picture is <i>Avatar.</i>

17:33.553 --> 17:36.681
Well, those are all the nominations.
I will not be taking any questions.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.182
Goodbye. I must go.

17:41.519 --> 17:44.814
I gotta say, we picked
some top-notch noms.

17:44.897 --> 17:45.731
You know it!

17:45.815 --> 17:47.900
Boy, was I glad when we got
out of that theater, though.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.902
I know. So many questions.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.613
"Oh, what the hell happened?

17:52.697 --> 17:57.785
Why were you reading off that napkin?
Why are you guys running?"

17:57.868 --> 18:00.079
They have their nominees.
What more could they want?

18:00.162 --> 18:02.999
You know what's crazy?
We saved the day today,

18:03.082 --> 18:05.751
and no one will ever even know.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.879
Hey, we'll know.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.925
Mr. Peanutbutter, we know what you did.

18:13.009 --> 18:13.926
Oh, boy.

18:14.677 --> 18:18.347
So, the good news is,
my brother's surgery was a success.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.725
And the bad news is,
you're not nominated for an Oscar.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.435
And the other good news is...

18:22.518 --> 18:24.145
...that each breath is a gift

18:24.228 --> 18:25.980
and it is a joy to live.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.816
-What?
-We are so lucky we get to be alive.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.943
-No, before that.
-Oh, I didn't tell you.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.904
-My brother's been sick.
-No, I don't care about your brother.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.072
First of all, manners.

18:35.156 --> 18:38.284
Second of all, I think if you met him,
you'd actually really hit it off.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.037
Imagine me but with less
"in your face" cool guy attitude.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.955
Did you say I'm not nominated
for an Oscar?

18:43.039 --> 18:44.040
Oh...

18:44.123 --> 18:45.791
A lot of people are mighty steamed,

18:45.875 --> 18:48.336
but I feel like what everyone's
overlooking here is,

18:48.419 --> 18:50.588
I got most of the categories dead-on.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.341
That's pretty amazing, and I am not
getting enough credit for that.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.843
Did you know
that <i>Avatar </i>came out in 2009?

18:55.926 --> 18:58.012
-I'm not nominated for an Oscar.
-No.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.848
But you know what they say.
"It's an honor just to be nominated."

19:00.931 --> 19:01.932
Oh, wait.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.310
So, I'm just like everybody else.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.313
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,
please don't get mad at Todd.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.733
-Why would I get mad at Todd?
-Exactly. This is totally my fault.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.610
-He didn't even want to nominate you.
-What?

19:12.693 --> 19:13.819
With the gift of hindsight,

19:13.903 --> 19:16.530
I see now how that might have
made you even more upset.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.450
But I realized something today,
when my brother called from the hospital,

19:19.533 --> 19:21.786
and I think it's gonna
make you feel a lot better.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.164
-What? What is it?
-None of this matters.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.124
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.715
As a partner in the company,

19:34.799 --> 19:37.176
I am prepared to forgo my salary
for the next three months,

19:37.259 --> 19:39.637
but even then, we're going
to need some sort of miracle.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.473
What are we doing?
What was the point of any of this?

19:42.556 --> 19:45.101
I wasted everyone's time for six months.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.062
Soon, I'll get some offer
from one of the big five agencies

19:48.145 --> 19:49.647
that I can't say no to,

19:49.730 --> 19:51.107
and I'll go back to being another cog

19:51.190 --> 19:54.819
in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker
that is this industry.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.321
-Is that the best I can hope for?
-Not necessarily.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.824
Although, there is one thing
I should probably mention.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.200
What is it, Judah?

20:02.493 --> 20:06.205
Maybe this is an opportunity
to live one of your other eight lives.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.375
Yeah, maybe.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.919
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Judah.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.213
I found it to be
an above average experience.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.799
Please forgive me for getting emotional.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.266
Rye, wheat, or sourdough?

20:25.349 --> 20:27.268
Can I get it on stale?

20:27.351 --> 20:30.730
And then, he said,
I fetishize my own sadness.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.482
What did you think was
gonna happen? Why did you go there?

20:33.566 --> 20:34.734
I don't know.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.652
-Did you ask for water?
-No.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.113
They're not supposed to give us water
unless we ask.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.241
-Don't they know there's a drought?
-You want to send the water back?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.160
No, I want the water. I just...

20:44.243 --> 20:46.704
I went to BoJack's house
to congratulate him.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.164
I'm not trying to pick fights.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.583
Well, you don't have to see him at all
if you don't want to.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.334
It's not like you work for him anymore.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.546
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?
-Who cares what he thinks?

20:55.629 --> 20:58.507
Why do you have
this weird fixation with him?

20:58.591 --> 21:02.261
I do not have a fixation, Roxy.
I worry about him.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.512
Okay. And last year?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.973
When you came back from Cordovia
and needed a place to crash?

21:06.056 --> 21:08.642
Oh, you could have stayed with me,
or any of your other friends,

21:08.726 --> 21:10.186
but you went right to his house.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.730
Did you ever ask yourself why?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.358
They're filling everyone's glasses.
This is insane.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.694
Oh, my God. What do you care?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.362
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?

21:20.446 --> 21:23.491
Do you know you're breaking the law
by giving everybody water?

21:23.574 --> 21:24.742
It's okay. I want the water.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.912
Yeah, we all want water.
That's not the point.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.956
In the state of California,
it is illegal for a restaurant

21:31.040 --> 21:33.793
to serve people water
before they ask for it.

21:35.586 --> 21:36.921
There is a drought.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.714
Sit down! We're thirsty!

21:38.798 --> 21:41.759
You know,
this is what's wrong with society.

21:41.842 --> 21:42.718
Diane...

21:42.802 --> 21:45.763
Nobody thinks about the world
outside themselves.

21:47.056 --> 21:50.518
So, how you doing?
You still working at that place?

21:53.562 --> 21:56.065
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Ralph. It's Princess Carolyn.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.235
<i>Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn,</i>
<i>I never thought I'd hear from you again.</i>

21:59.318 --> 22:00.986
I might have some free time coming up.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.155
I was wondering
if you might want to get a drink.

22:03.239 --> 22:07.409
<i>Okay. So, the night I met you after I said</i>
<i>goodbye, the craziest thing happened.</i>

22:07.493 --> 22:08.494
Okay?

22:08.577 --> 22:10.579
<i>I was walking back to my car,</i>
<i>when all of a sudden,</i>

22:10.663 --> 22:12.289
<i>- this woman...</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

22:12.373 --> 22:14.250
<i>...tripped on a cobblestone,</i>
<i>twisted her ankle,</i>

22:14.333 --> 22:16.168
<i>- and tumbled into my arms.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

22:16.252 --> 22:19.171
<i>Turns out, she was a ballerina,</i>
<i>and she didn't speak a word of English.</i>

22:19.255 --> 22:21.924
<i>So, I rushed her to the hospital,</i>
<i>and long story short, we eloped.</i>

22:22.007 --> 22:23.175
- <i>Oh.</i>
- I moved to Russia,

22:23.259 --> 22:24.385
and I'm totally messing with you.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.553
-None of that's true.
-<i>What?</i>

22:25.636 --> 22:27.763
I would love to see you again.
I think about you all the time.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.683
- Really?
<i>- Yeah. How about this Saturday?</i>

22:30.766 --> 22:31.809
It's a date.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.607
Ana?

22:38.691 --> 22:42.111
Uh, no, it's just me,
giant chocolate Oscar guy.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.363
I'm here to pick up
the giant chocolate Oscar.

22:44.446 --> 22:49.034
My boss really wants our product
to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.870
You know, to maintain the integrity
of the giant chocolate Oscar.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.706
I don't care. Take it.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.709
<i>You've reached Ana Spanakopita.</i>

22:56.792 --> 22:59.628
<i>How did you get this number?</i>
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

22:59.712 --> 23:01.964
Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.049
Please call me back. I need you.

23:04.133 --> 23:08.012
Ana, please.
This is BoJack, by the way. Horseman.

23:08.971 --> 23:11.390
Hey! Todd! Where you been?

23:11.473 --> 23:13.017
-Oh, hi.
-You were in Ojai?

23:13.100 --> 23:16.061
-No, I was just saying hi.
-Well, why not go to Ojai, huh?

23:16.145 --> 23:18.272
You and me?
I could use an escape, couldn't you?

23:18.355 --> 23:19.940
It's not really a good time.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.484
Todd, I need this.
You're my best friend and I need you.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.945
Don't leave me now.
Don't be like everybody else.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.614
I'm not leaving you. I just--

23:26.697 --> 23:30.367
Besides, I think you owe me, right?
After what you did?

23:30.451 --> 23:32.494
-What I did?
-Come on, Todd. I know.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.247
-Mr. Peanutbutter told me everything.
-Everything?

23:35.331 --> 23:38.834
Even told you, when I was a kid, I used
to bang on my butt like a bongo drum

23:38.917 --> 23:40.794
-when I got out of the bath?
-What?

23:40.878 --> 23:43.589
<i>♪ Todd-o, me and Todd-o ♪</i>

23:43.672 --> 23:47.051
<i>♪ Bath time come</i>
<i>Make Todd shiny and clean ♪</i>

23:47.134 --> 23:49.470
Mm, no, not-not about that.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.472
So, he didn't tell you everything.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.724
Did he tell you about the time
I counted to a million?

23:53.807 --> 23:58.312
One, two, three, four, five, six--

23:58.395 --> 24:01.023
-No, stop.
-But I was just getting to the good part!

24:01.106 --> 24:04.693
What? Seven? He told me you didn't want
to nominate me for an Oscar.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.445
-Oh, that.
-What the hell, man?

24:06.528 --> 24:08.656
-After everything I've done for you?
-What are you talking about?

24:08.739 --> 24:11.533
Oh, I don't know. Letting you live here
for free for six years?

24:11.617 --> 24:14.244
Giving you food, indulging you
in your little projects and adventures

24:14.328 --> 24:17.164
and stories about how you used to bang
on your butt like a bongo drum?

24:17.247 --> 24:18.332
I let you turn my house

24:18.415 --> 24:19.917
into your company's headquarters
for the last month.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.877
Yeah, but that's not
because you're my friend.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.089
-That's because you felt bad about Emily.
-You know about Emily?

24:25.673 --> 24:28.467
I think I know.
Why? What do you think I know?

24:28.550 --> 24:29.802
I mean, I know what I think,

24:29.885 --> 24:33.681
but I don't know if the thing that I think
is the thing that you think I know.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.141
-You know?
-So, you know I had sex with Emily.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.477
You had sex with Emily?!

24:38.560 --> 24:41.105
-Well, what did you think?
-I don't know! Not that!

24:41.188 --> 24:42.940
I just knew something sketchy happened.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.234
I thought maybe you gave her
one of your weird monologues

24:45.317 --> 24:46.527
about how sad you are,

24:46.610 --> 24:47.611
and it bummed her out!

24:47.695 --> 24:49.988
Todd, I'm sorry, all right?
I screwed up.

24:50.072 --> 24:54.159
-I know I screwed up. I don't know why--
-Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes!

24:54.243 --> 24:55.828
You can't keep doing this!

24:55.911 --> 24:59.581
You can't keep doing shitty things,
and then feel bad about yourself

24:59.665 --> 25:01.417
like that makes it okay!

25:01.500 --> 25:03.919
You need to be better!

25:04.002 --> 25:05.713
I know. And I'm sorry, okay?

25:05.796 --> 25:09.758
I was drunk, and there was all this
pressure with the Oscar campaign.

25:09.842 --> 25:15.139
-But now-- Now that it's over, I--
-No! No, BoJack, just stop.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.016
You are all the things
that are wrong with you.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.269
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs,

25:20.352 --> 25:23.272
or any of the shitty things
that happened to you in your career,

25:23.355 --> 25:24.523
or when you were a kid.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.066
It's you.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.903
All right? It's you.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.535
