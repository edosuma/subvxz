WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:13.133 --> 00:15.833
The Geordies are back.
Hello!

00:15.900 --> 00:18.400
'Doing the things we love.'
Woo!

00:18.467 --> 00:20.167
But this time...

00:20.233 --> 00:22.733
...man's gonna mix things right
up.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.400
(gasps)
With four newbies!

00:29.467 --> 00:31.300
Oh, my God!

00:31.367 --> 00:33.367
It's gonna be fucking mint.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.500
Anna's given the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.

00:37.567 --> 00:39.833
I love a bit of change, me.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.067
But some things never change.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.933
I love this family.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.367
Ding fucking ding, you dicks.

00:51.433 --> 00:52.667
(cheering)

00:52.733 --> 00:54.700
Take it all in, bitch.
Take it all in.

00:54.767 --> 00:56.833
Did you shag? Yeah!

00:56.900 --> 00:59.467
The second time you shag,
you get the feelings.

00:59.533 --> 01:03.267
Is he boyfriend material,
Bethan?
Shit, I'm falling, aren't I?

01:03.333 --> 01:07.167
I've got a wicked singles'
event.
Great, Abbie's here.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.000
It's a shame we're not necking
on
this time. Shame.

01:13.867 --> 01:15.967
Beau has got some explaining to
do.

01:16.033 --> 01:18.000
Tell the fucking truth!

01:18.067 --> 01:20.867
I'm not gonna get talked to
like that.

01:20.933 --> 01:23.133
I'm really, really
an insecure person.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.400
You think you can give us
more affection, more attention.

01:26.467 --> 01:28.600
I'm going to do whatever it
takes.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.067
"You make me so proud."

01:30.133 --> 01:32.133
I am literally in shock.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.800
I want to show Beau
what he's missing.

01:35.733 --> 01:38.300
I think Bethan's got a twinkle
in her eye for me.

01:38.367 --> 01:40.100
She's trying to piss me off.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.833
'I'm preened to perfection.'

01:45.900 --> 01:47.800
'I'm totally crackers, me like.'

01:47.867 --> 01:50.933
'I'm a lad who's got more cheek
that a girl with fillers.'

01:51.000 --> 01:54.367
'Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy.
I'm all over the place.'

01:54.433 --> 01:57.267
'I'm that good looking,
I'd even neck on with myself.'

01:57.333 --> 02:00.067
'I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.'

02:00.133 --> 02:02.967
'I might dance like a grandad,
but I'm proper radge.'

02:03.033 --> 02:05.667
'I'm fit, I'm flirty,
and I've got double F's.'

02:05.733 --> 02:08.900
'I don't go on the pull,
the girls just love the guns.'

02:08.967 --> 02:12.300
'I might look rough and ready,
but I'm a massive softly.'

02:12.367 --> 02:15.567
'I cannot believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot.'

02:15.633 --> 02:18.267
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:26.900 --> 02:28.400
Wakey, wakey.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.867
My mouth tastes like garlic and
ass.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.267
Morning.

02:34.067 --> 02:37.633
The only way I could describe
the way your body looked last
night

02:37.700 --> 02:39.467
was like a bottle of Fanta.
Why?

02:39.533 --> 02:43.633
Just the curves in all the right
places. I suppose that's lovely.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.533
I did have a good night with
Chloe,

02:45.600 --> 02:48.267
but I need to work
on this relationship malarkey

02:48.333 --> 02:50.400
to get me and Chloe
back to a good place.

02:50.467 --> 02:54.033
The only way I could describe
you
is a bit like a ruler, very
skinny.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.500
Is that a compliment?

02:55.567 --> 02:58.133
Yes, that's how I like my lads.
Tall and skinny.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.600
After everything
we went through in Belfast,

03:00.667 --> 03:03.633
I am so happy that Sam
is making an effort with us.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.367
Hi, you.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.833
I need to know what happened
with you and Beau.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.033
Oh, God. To be honest,
I don't even want to talk about
it.

03:15.100 --> 03:18.700
'Last night, I went through
all the emotions that I've got.'

03:18.767 --> 03:22.167
And now I've woke up
and I'm just so confused.

03:22.233 --> 03:25.000
He's not understanding
where I'm coming from.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.533
He's not being true to his
feelings,
I think.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.867
'Chloe's right. I didn't believe
Beau
when he ended things.'

03:30.933 --> 03:34.333
We can have something special.
I'm not ready to give up on him.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.300
Deep down he does like you,
he's trying to act the lad.

03:37.367 --> 03:41.233
And when you were flirting last
night, deep down he was
devastated.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.167
It's dawned on me that last
night,

03:43.233 --> 03:46.267
I may have stepped over the line
by flirting with Bethan.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.700
I need to talk to Beau and make
sure
he's not pissed off with me.

03:49.767 --> 03:53.433
I just want to lighten the mood.
Isn't it your turn now? (gasps)

03:53.500 --> 03:56.600
Sam has made me
a special pineapple full of
notes,

03:56.667 --> 03:58.567
saying how much that I mean to
him.

03:58.633 --> 04:01.300
No boy has ever done
anything like that for us.

04:01.367 --> 04:04.833
What more do you want on a
tampon
than, "Ur my world?"

04:04.900 --> 04:08.000
Honestly, that's the cutest
thing
I've ever seen.

04:10.267 --> 04:13.600
You didn't piss, did ya?
I didn't check. Schoolboy error.

04:13.667 --> 04:17.100
How do you feel after how last
night
went down with you and Bethan?

04:17.166 --> 04:19.500
Sound, mate. Aye. Absolutely
sound.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.466
I ended things with Bethan

04:21.533 --> 04:24.100
cos things were getting too
serious,
too fast.

04:24.167 --> 04:26.567
But she didn't have to flirt
with Alex.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.400
She's always said,
"Oh, Alex isn't my type".

04:29.467 --> 04:31.033
Did it piss you off?
Yeah.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.967
I am a bit gutted about Bethan
flirting with Alex,

04:34.033 --> 04:36.800
and I'm pissed off with Alex
for going along with it.

04:36.867 --> 04:39.833
Anybody fancy breakfast?
Yes. I thought you'd never ask.

04:39.900 --> 04:43.333
'I always thought it was Beau
that was fucking Bethan around.'

04:43.400 --> 04:45.633
But Bethan has been
playing games as well.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.600
My balls really stink.
(sniffs)

04:48.667 --> 04:50.133
Strong, isn't it?

04:54.333 --> 04:56.000
(Tahlia) Why won't this work?

04:58.133 --> 05:01.400
Have you put green tea in, or
tea?
I dunno, I forgot.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.833
Ah! Yes!
She is my favourite lesbian.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.833
I'm the only one you know.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.733
Listen. I've got an idea, right?

05:11.800 --> 05:14.400
Why don't I cook us all
a nice family meal?

05:14.467 --> 05:18.433
I'm gonna make probably Thai
curry.
No spice! No spice!

05:18.500 --> 05:22.200
We've never sat round the table
and had a proper family dinner.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.333
So tonight, I'm changing that.

05:25.267 --> 05:27.633
Come on, let's get ready.
Howay then.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.367
Before you get ready,
you take a seat down here.

05:30.433 --> 05:32.933
Ever since Chloe
opened up about her feelings,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.333
I feel like I need to make
more of an effort.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.200
I've got a little surprise for
her.

05:37.267 --> 05:41.933
Why don't I, to make you feel
more
better, I'm gonna take you
shopping.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.833
You being deadly serious?
Deadly serious, yes.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.933
Oh, my God. That is amazing.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.200
He has never took me clothes
shopping. I am so excited.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.233
Shop till you drop,
but I don't want to spend a
fortune.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.033
Aw!

05:55.100 --> 05:57.200
I'd best go upstairs,
get my clothes on,

05:57.267 --> 05:59.433
and get ready
to spend a fortune on Chloe.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.900
Come on, Chloe!

06:00.967 --> 06:03.833
Ooh! You look sexy as fuck!

06:03.900 --> 06:05.167
Bye!

06:13.267 --> 06:14.433
Agh!

06:14.500 --> 06:17.733
Fuck me,
I've jumped onto a fuckin' plug.

06:19.733 --> 06:20.867
Fuck!
You all right?

06:20.933 --> 06:23.700
Beau has come in hobbling.
What is wrong with him?

06:23.767 --> 06:25.167
What have you done?

06:25.233 --> 06:27.867
I was on the bike
and I landed on a plug.

06:27.933 --> 06:31.433
I need to get Beau to hospital
cos his foot doesn't look good.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.633
You are a good friend.

06:32.700 --> 06:37.133
'A couple of days ago, it
would've
been Bethan taking me to
hospital.'

06:37.200 --> 06:39.700
But I'm glad Nathan's here
to have my back.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.967
Ah, fuck. (grunts)

06:42.033 --> 06:44.100
(door slams)
'That's the door.'

06:44.167 --> 06:47.500
I can't believe Beau's left
and he hasn't even said bye.

06:47.567 --> 06:49.233
He needs to grow up.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.367
Ooh!

06:59.433 --> 07:01.833
I know that
this is gonna cost me a fortune,

07:01.900 --> 07:04.600
but it's gonna give me and Chloe
some one on one time,

07:04.667 --> 07:05.833
which we do need.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.867
I think I need some new
trainers.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.600
Yeah, I think you suit them.

07:11.900 --> 07:15.467
Oh, I love that. Do you have
this
in a large? What size is this?

07:15.533 --> 07:18.400
I feel like you're really
trying hard to make us happy.

07:18.467 --> 07:20.767
I am putting
an extra special effort in.

07:20.833 --> 07:23.033
I'm pulling out all the stops
for her,

07:23.100 --> 07:25.833
so I hope she realises
how important she is to me.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.667
With my past,
I'm scared of getting hurt by
men.

07:28.733 --> 07:30.900
I need to stop thinking that
about you.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.700
I wish I'd have told you sooner.

07:32.767 --> 07:34.433
Between this and my pineapple,

07:34.500 --> 07:36.900
Sam is taking steps
in the right direction.

07:36.967 --> 07:40.300
This is exactly what I want.
Now I feel so much more loved.

07:40.367 --> 07:43.833
Ooh, love it! This will be good
for one of our kids.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.233
We don't have kids.

07:46.933 --> 07:47.933
That's nice.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.567
I'm gonna try some on, Sam.

07:54.633 --> 07:57.400
Ooh!
Good one.

07:57.467 --> 08:00.967
Hello.
I think we've have a very good
day.

08:01.033 --> 08:04.467
Quality time with my boyfriend
and my boyfriend's wallet.

08:04.533 --> 08:07.300
A massive thank you
to the most amazing boyfriend

08:07.367 --> 08:08.833
in the entire universe.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.600
This is worse than going to the
gym.
(groans)

08:19.100 --> 08:21.133
That's so nice, I want to wear
that.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.800
Chloe and Sam are shopping
and Nat's cooking.

08:23.867 --> 08:26.400
I haven't got a clue
where Nathan and Beau are.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.967
So I think it's time for me and
Tahlia to have some girl time.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.567
Look what I've brought.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.033
Are you kidding?
Nope.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.133
Is it really that bad?
Aye.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.433
The boy is injured.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.799
As if you weren't already
a lazy fucker.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.799
The plug went in my foot.
I've got to keep a bandage on
it.

08:41.866 --> 08:45.133
Fancy helping us chop?
Not really, like, I'm in pain.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.333
Top man.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.300
Nat, if you want to cook
everyone
tea, you can crack on.

08:49.367 --> 08:50.633
But I'm an injured man.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.367
This one's you. Knives in there.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.533
Thank you very much.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.367
How the fuck have me and Beau
been roped into this?

08:58.433 --> 09:02.733
Beau's should be resting, and I
didn't want to cook for anyone.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.033
Can't just have the boys
helping.
Got to be the girls, too.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.000
I'm being forced to cook
against my own free will.

09:11.233 --> 09:13.100
Girlies.
Hi.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.800
I'm gonna start cooking.
Fancy doing us a favour?

09:15.867 --> 09:17.467
Get the plates and cutlery.

09:17.533 --> 09:20.233
We'll be down in a second.
Cheers, girls.

09:20.300 --> 09:24.233
I can't believe Natalie is
giving
me and Tahlia proper chores to
do.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.833
She's literally like a mam.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.733
Since Sophie's left, right,

09:27.800 --> 09:31.733
I feel like Natalie is trying to
be like, "I'm the mam. I'm the
mam."

09:31.800 --> 09:34.800
This is the first time
I've lived away from home.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.633
I thought it was gonna be
all partying and necking on.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.467
But I've gotta listen to Natalie
trying to mother us.

09:40.533 --> 09:42.633
You and Beau
are still rocky and stuff.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.000
Are you gonna drink tonight?
Yeah.

09:45.067 --> 09:48.867
I'm just not gonna drink too
much,
because I do still like him,

09:48.933 --> 09:50.733
but he's really mugged me off.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.900
'Somehow, Beau has just managed
to shut his feelings off.'

09:53.967 --> 09:56.100
But I'm not like that.
I can't do that.

09:56.167 --> 09:59.700
Especially with a lad that I
like,
that I live with and I work
with.

09:59.767 --> 10:03.933
Put the ball in your court. You
decide what's gonna happen
tonight.

10:08.067 --> 10:11.000
Girls? Are yous coming down?

10:11.067 --> 10:13.833
Two seconds!
(laughs)

10:13.900 --> 10:17.133
Right, Nate? Will you chop us
some cherry tomatoes up now?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.267
I thought you wanted the
chicken.
Yeah, I know.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.267
Come on. You're on a roll now.

10:22.333 --> 10:25.300
What's going on with you, Beau?
What do you mean?

10:25.367 --> 10:28.633
Cos last night,
Alex and Bethan were flirting a
bit.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.633
I'm not with Bethan,
we're giving each other space.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.900
The thing with Bethan,
when she loses it,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.933
it reminds me of past
relationships
which ended badly.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.367
And I just want to have fun.

10:38.433 --> 10:40.300
Girls? Come on!

10:40.367 --> 10:43.633
(groans)
Right, let's just go downstairs

10:43.700 --> 10:46.333
before Mother Nat
shouts us down again.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.200
What do you need our help with?

10:48.267 --> 10:50.633
Will yous get the plates
and the cutlery out?

10:50.700 --> 10:54.267
I know Nat is cooking us dinner,
but I don't need to be bossed
around.

10:54.333 --> 10:55.633
'I'm not a child.'

10:55.700 --> 10:59.500
Where do you want this? Pop them
on
the top so we know what we've
got.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.533
How're you going?
Good, how are you?

11:01.600 --> 11:04.467
That smells... oof.
(slams cutlery)

11:04.533 --> 11:05.867
Are you all right?

11:05.933 --> 11:09.900
What is Bethan's problem? All
I've
asked her to do is lay the
table.

11:09.967 --> 11:11.433
She's acting like a child.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.933
(Nathan) It's about time!
Hello, you.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.333
What's good?!
What the hell? (screams)

11:17.400 --> 11:19.267
I just about fit through the
door.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.733
I can't believe
how many bags there is.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.333
Never again.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.400
We have spent a fortune today.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.833
Why you shouldn't
get in a relationship.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.400
Oh, shit! Have you got a crutch?
What happened?

11:30.467 --> 11:32.433
A plug went straight through
my foot.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.400
'Nat has wound me up so much,

11:34.467 --> 11:37.433
I haven't even noticed
that Beau is on crutches.'

11:37.500 --> 11:40.833
Seeing him in pain makes us want
to
go over and give him a cuddle.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.667
But he's a fucking arsehole!

11:47.233 --> 11:49.233
You're niggling.
Having a go at her.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.800
That has really thrown me.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.400
Ugh!

11:53.467 --> 11:56.033
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:57.967 --> 11:58.167
.

12:00.700 --> 12:00.900
.

12:12.433 --> 12:15.100
Nat, this is absolutely
fantastic.

12:15.167 --> 12:18.300
It's nice to have us all round
one table and actually eating.

12:18.367 --> 12:21.900
This must be the first time in
ages
we're sat down as a family,

12:21.967 --> 12:25.133
around this table,
and we're having no kick-offs.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.233
'It is so nice.'

12:27.300 --> 12:28.633
I will say, Nat,

12:28.700 --> 12:31.833
you have taken this mother role
very seriously. I tried.

12:31.900 --> 12:36.600
I've known Nat for ages outside
this
house and we've never had a
problem.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.833
But living with her
is a different story

12:38.900 --> 12:40.667
and I need to tell her how I
feel.

12:40.733 --> 12:44.300
I do feel like sometimes when
you do
do the washing, I feel guilty.

12:44.367 --> 12:48.100
Does anyone else have an issue
with me doing washing or making
tea?

12:48.167 --> 12:49.733
I don't think it's an issue,

12:49.800 --> 12:52.833
but sometimes it comes across
just really, really nice,

12:52.900 --> 12:55.167
to the point where
it's almost annoying.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.967
If everyone is gonna lay their
cards
on the table,

12:58.033 --> 13:00.833
then I may as well
get something off my chest, too.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.467
For me, it was less about
the washing and dishes.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.800
It was when you called us
"Little'un."

13:05.867 --> 13:09.433
You're just niggling.
I'm not, it's how I feel.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.700
It's not shit.
So you're telling me how you
feel...

13:12.767 --> 13:15.467
Hang on a minute.
You're proper having a go at
her.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.033
'That has really thrown me.'

13:17.100 --> 13:19.333
Everyone was in bits
when Sophie left,

13:19.400 --> 13:22.267
so I was just trying
to bring everyone back together.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.033
Didn't realise
it was gonna turn into a witch
hunt.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.033
It's unfair how everyone's went
on

13:27.100 --> 13:29.233
when we're having
a nice family meal.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.333
It's better to address it now
so then it's all in the open,

13:32.400 --> 13:34.800
rather than being a bit awkward
on nights out.

13:34.867 --> 13:37.833
Cos we are all living together
and it gets frustrating.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.867
The newbies are starting to
learn
that living together 24/7 is
tough.

13:41.933 --> 13:43.300
So let's just get ready

13:43.367 --> 13:46.167
and concentrate on having
a mint night out.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.833
'The family dinner
did not go as planned.'

13:53.900 --> 13:57.000
But Tahlia seems to the one
who's taken the most offence.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.133
Hopefully that doesn't affect
everyone's mood tonight

14:00.200 --> 14:02.133
and nothing kicks off.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.967
I feel like we've had such a day
that I feel like we should stay
in.

14:06.033 --> 14:09.633
Tonight?
And have wine and ice cream.
(laughs)

14:09.700 --> 14:12.400
I know that Bethan is going
through
such a shit time,

14:12.467 --> 14:15.700
but me and Sam had such a lovely
day
and I want it to continue.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.833
After the day we've had today,
of course I want to stay in.

14:18.900 --> 14:22.767
You tell the girls, I'll tell
the
boys. They'll be fuming about
it.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.467
So, basically I have decided
tonight I'm gonna stay in.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.133
(Bethan) Yeah. Do it.

14:31.100 --> 14:35.000
Me and Chloe are staying in
tonight.
I think it'll be very good for
you.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.267
Ooh!
Woo!

14:41.333 --> 14:43.067
Yous girls look sexy.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.700
(Nathan) Cheers to a weird
night.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.100
(all cheer)

14:51.167 --> 14:52.867
Bye!

14:52.933 --> 14:55.367
See you later.
Have fun, Sam.

15:03.433 --> 15:06.633
Sam and Chloe aren't out,
Nat and Tahlia aren't speaking,

15:06.700 --> 15:08.433
and me and Beau aren't speaking.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.333
I can't feel tonight
is gonna be a disaster.

15:29.567 --> 15:32.100
I don't want Bethan and Beau
to kick off tonight,

15:32.167 --> 15:34.833
so I'm gonna do my best
to keep Bethan entertained.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.600
I've been putting this off all
day,

15:51.667 --> 15:55.033
but I need to talk to Beau about
flirting with Bethan last night.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.667
He's on crutches
so at least he can't chase me.

16:12.867 --> 16:15.333
Last night,
I thought I was done with
Bethan.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.867
But I'm not gonna lie, seeing
her
with Alex made me feel
something.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.300
I'm glad Alex has apologised,

16:26.367 --> 16:29.367
but he needs to learn
how we do things in Newcastle.

16:39.300 --> 16:43.367
'Tonight's dinner's got me
thinking
about what I'm like to live
with.'

16:43.433 --> 16:46.700
I need to sort things out
with Bethan and Tahlia.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.433
I feel so relieved
that Natalie's apologised.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.433
It's took a weight off my
shoulders.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.267
Now I feel like I can
open up to her.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.900
'I'm happy that I've cleared the
air
with Tahlia and Bethan.'

17:17.967 --> 17:20.833
Moving forward, we can spend
a bit more time together

17:20.900 --> 17:22.767
and they can see what I'm like.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.967
I really like having Tahlia
in the house.

17:59.033 --> 18:00.833
We're both in the same boat.

18:00.900 --> 18:04.067
We're both single
and we're both getting over our
exes.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.767
When I first came in this house,
I was really lost.

18:17.833 --> 18:21.400
But Nathan has helped me find
myself
as a confident, single woman.

18:29.867 --> 18:32.400
In all the time I have been here
in this house,

18:32.467 --> 18:34.433
I've never stayed in on a night
out.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.467
It's been really nice to spend
a bit of one on one time.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.667
It's a relief to me
that Chloe is noticing

18:39.733 --> 18:42.867
that I am putting so much effort
into making her feel better,

18:42.933 --> 18:44.267
and I think it's working.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.100
If there's anything, little or
big,
on your mind,

18:47.167 --> 18:49.900
you can just say it straight
away.
I know.

18:49.967 --> 18:52.067
I think we're very strong
as a couple.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.933
Even though the way I went on
in Belfast is terrible,

18:55.033 --> 18:58.400
I'm glad it happened,
cos me and Sam are closer than
ever.

18:58.467 --> 19:01.600
I think we should go to bed
before the others get back.

19:01.667 --> 19:05.533
I hope they don't wake us up
when
they get in. They wouldn't dare.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.967
It is doing my head in that Beau
hasn't even come over to speak
to us.

19:39.067 --> 19:43.133
I wish I could just turn my
feelings
off, I really do, but I can't.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.633
I like Beau a lot.
I just want us to be OK.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.600
As soon as I ended things
with Bethan,

19:55.667 --> 19:57.400
she started flirting with Alex.

19:57.467 --> 20:00.100
Seeing them two together
made me feel something.

20:00.167 --> 20:03.933
But I've been hurt in the past.
I'm
not sure if I want to go back
there.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.500
Ugh! I wish I'd never even spoke
to Alex last night.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.967
I don't know
if I've done the right thing.

20:23.033 --> 20:25.067
Why are relationships so
difficult,

20:25.133 --> 20:27.100
especially when you live
with a girl?

20:42.433 --> 20:44.367
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

20:44.433 --> 20:47.333
I wanna get home, I wanna eat
a kebab, I wanna go to bed.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.700
Get in! Pack your crutches.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.900
Oh!
Oh, Beau, ow!

20:53.967 --> 20:58.267
Thank God we are leaving this
club
because I have had a shit night.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.233
And that big mouth, Aussie Alex,
has went over to Beau

21:01.300 --> 21:04.500
and he must have told him
I was flirting with him. What a
dick.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.100
I'm gonna say one thing to you
now.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.700
You tried to crack on with me
last night.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.600
You turned around and said to
me,
"Let's have a kiss."

21:12.667 --> 21:14.433
And I pied you off last night.

21:14.500 --> 21:18.400
'Bethan is just chucking all
the blame on me. What the fuck?'

21:18.467 --> 21:20.233
We'll sort it out in the
morning.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.533
Alex, it's not funny!
I'm not laughing.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.433
Well, why are you laughing?!

21:30.467 --> 21:32.267
Tonight has been a bit of a
washout.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.800
Nothing's changed
between Bethan and Beau,

21:34.867 --> 21:37.267
but at least Nat
has made up with the girls.

21:37.333 --> 21:41.367
I's probably best if we get
this scran down us and hit the
sack.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.967
The longest night in a night out
I've ever had in my life.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.333
(Natalie) Love you, Alex.
Alex, do you love me yet?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.067
Hmm.
Ah!

21:56.133 --> 21:58.867
If you snore,
I'm still smacking your feet.

22:00.533 --> 22:03.233
I'm not even drunk!
You're not even drunk?

22:03.300 --> 22:07.500
I'm fucking sober, you prick!
If you're sober then I'm
straight.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.833
I just wish that I was honest
with him in the start.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.767
I've had enough.
I don't like you.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.300
Stay out my business!

22:15.367 --> 22:18.033
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:20.467 --> 22:20.667
.

22:23.200 --> 22:23.400
.

22:50.033 --> 22:52.200
It was nice
staying in with Sam last night,

22:52.267 --> 22:56.200
but I'm dying to know what went
on
with Bethan and Beau yesterday.

22:56.267 --> 22:59.367
How are yous feeling?
I'm just hungover,

22:59.433 --> 23:03.867
and I can't be fucking arsed
to go through this shit every
night.

23:03.933 --> 23:07.300
I can't believe that me and Beau
still haven't sorted it out.

23:07.367 --> 23:10.400
Me and him are going round
in circles, and I've had enough.

23:10.467 --> 23:12.067
I feel like I'm losing me head.

23:12.133 --> 23:15.833
You're saying one thing and
doing another, and not talking
to us.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.733
And I'm sick of being upset now.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.867
(sobs) I'm sick of being upset
now.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.167
I'm fucking sick.

23:23.233 --> 23:25.833
I promised myself
I wouldn't get upset over boys

23:25.900 --> 23:29.367
and I wouldn't get involved
with them. But look where we are
now.

23:29.433 --> 23:32.133
It's just so awful
cos you don't know what to do.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.000
Even though staying with Sam
last night was amazing,

23:35.067 --> 23:37.933
I do feel really bad
that I wasn't there for Bethan,

23:38.000 --> 23:39.633
so I need to talk to Beau.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.367
Get up, have a nice breakfast,

23:41.433 --> 23:44.900
come out tonight, we'll have a
good night. A girls' night,
right?

23:48.067 --> 23:50.267
How is everyone?
I feel lovely. Sound.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.267
I feel all right. I'm fresh.

23:52.333 --> 23:54.167
So, right, Bethan,

23:54.233 --> 23:58.233
I thought she was being fake,
like,
trying to put the blame on me.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.233
What do you mean by fake, like?

24:00.300 --> 24:03.700
It takes two to tango, and she
was
just being as flirty as I was.

24:03.767 --> 24:08.133
I can genuinely see she's
trying everything in the book
now.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.400
Alex thinks that Bethan's
playing games to get my
attention.

24:11.467 --> 24:14.233
To be fair, I did finish it
with her. I don't blame her.

24:14.300 --> 24:15.900
The girl is besotted by you.

24:15.967 --> 24:19.000
Do you feel awkward admitting
your feelings? Aye, 100%.

24:19.067 --> 24:22.033
I do like the girl,
but she was a prick to us.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.233
Sort it out,
just for everyone's sake.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.467
Beau, you need to be honest
about your feelings for Bethan,

24:27.533 --> 24:29.467
cos everyone's over the drama.

24:29.533 --> 24:32.100
I do want to resolve things,
but shit takes time.

24:32.167 --> 24:34.800
I can't just fuckin'
flip out of how I'm feeling.

24:34.867 --> 24:36.933
That's not how it works for me.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.267
The boys are telling us
to go talk to Bethan,

24:39.333 --> 24:42.767
but how am I meant to talk to
her
when I don't know what's going
on?

24:42.833 --> 24:45.667
Right now, I need a coffee.
No sugar for me, mate.

24:45.733 --> 24:48.433
(Nathan) Natalie...
No, I'm not doing that.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.200
After what I learned about
myself
last night,

24:51.267 --> 24:53.533
there's no way I'm making a
coffee.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.533
Natalie's having a day off.
Mams have a day off too.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.400
Wait there,
don't you do anything to that.

25:04.467 --> 25:06.400
You butter these breads.

25:06.467 --> 25:09.567
What's the difference between
a poached egg and a fried egg?

25:09.633 --> 25:12.933
I'm still annoyed at Bethan
and I'm not gonna pull any
punches.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.400
I'm just gonna let her know
exactly how I feel.

25:15.467 --> 25:18.000
Bethan, can I just say,
I don't like you...

25:18.067 --> 25:22.233
To be honest, Alex,
I couldn't give a flying fuck,
mate.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.733
You're looking for the easy way
out.
Don't speak to me.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.700
I don't care
that you don't fancy me.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.233
I want you to admit
that you were in the wrong.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.067
You tried to crack on with...
No.

25:32.133 --> 25:34.433
You tried...
It takes two to tango.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.800
No, it doesn't.
It does.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.700
I would've tangoed with you
then.

25:37.767 --> 25:40.000
I've come down to get some
brekkie,

25:40.067 --> 25:42.300
and Bethan is tearing Alex
a new arsehole.

25:42.367 --> 25:43.733
Everybody take cover!

25:43.800 --> 25:46.867
You're trying to make it out
as if I was flirting with you.

25:46.933 --> 25:49.033
I can't be arsed.
Stay out my business.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.467
Stay out my business!

25:50.533 --> 25:52.167
Oh, you're...
Stay out of it.

25:52.233 --> 25:54.167
Ooh, a little bit of a clap.

25:54.233 --> 25:58.700
Stay away from me. Stay away
from me.
It's only getting started, love.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.800
'Why can't Alex just let this
go?'

26:00.867 --> 26:03.667
Why does he even care
if I was fake-flirting with him?

26:03.733 --> 26:06.333
It's obvious that I only like
Beau.

26:10.433 --> 26:13.033
(phone rings)

26:17.167 --> 26:19.000
Hello?
(Anna) "Alex?"

26:19.067 --> 26:20.267
Hi, Anna.

26:20.333 --> 26:23.867
"Can you tell Tahlia and Bethan
they need to go to work?" Will
do.

26:23.933 --> 26:26.633
"You can go as well, Alex."
Thank you. Goodbye.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.600
As if last night wasn't bad
enough,

26:28.667 --> 26:31.300
now I've got to go to work
with Bethan. Great.

26:31.367 --> 26:34.867
Today, there's two people that
have to go with me on Geordie
Tours.

26:34.933 --> 26:36.467
Who? Better not be me.

26:36.533 --> 26:39.333
Tahlia and Bethan,
we're all going... Yes!

26:39.400 --> 26:43.300
Honest to God, like. What the
fuck?

26:43.367 --> 26:46.133
Fucking hell.
How have I ended up with these
two?

26:46.200 --> 26:49.900
Workers, get ready for work.
People staying home, tidy up.

26:49.967 --> 26:51.000
Howay!

26:59.067 --> 27:01.400
Right, girls, time to go to
work.

27:01.467 --> 27:04.433
I can't believe that Anna's
sent me to work with Alex.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.833
I'd rather not be around him.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.400
I want no arguments.
Bye, guys, have fun. Bye!

27:15.333 --> 27:18.233
Well, this isn't awkward at all.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.600
What's wrong?

27:27.667 --> 27:30.433
I'm absolutely dying. I feel
ill.

27:30.500 --> 27:34.767
I don't know whether it was
Nat's
cooking last night or Chloe's
eggs,

27:34.833 --> 27:36.200
but I feel like shit.

27:36.267 --> 27:40.467
My head's banging. I'm warm...
Oh, my God. You've got a
temperature.

27:40.533 --> 27:41.933
I feel freezing.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.067
I don't think I'm gonna be
going out again tonight.

27:45.133 --> 27:47.267
Go and lie in the shag pad.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.033
Oh, my God.

27:52.367 --> 27:54.700
It's so cold.
Watch you don't fall.

27:54.767 --> 27:58.000
Something's not right here.
These three are running to work.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.633
Fuck me sideways,
that must be a first.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.233
Oh, my God.
Over here.

28:02.300 --> 28:05.467
Hello. Today, you three fuckers
are going powerboating.

28:05.533 --> 28:06.700
Yeah!

28:08.567 --> 28:11.800
Howay! Ready to have a frisk
on here? Yeah.

28:11.867 --> 28:13.600
Nothing like the Gold Coast.

28:13.667 --> 28:18.467
It is fucking freezing. My dick
has literally lost five inches.

28:18.533 --> 28:20.567
I only had a few
to begin with anyway.

28:20.633 --> 28:23.567
One of yous swap with me.
I'm not sitting next to Alex.

28:23.633 --> 28:24.767
I'll swap.

28:24.833 --> 28:28.933
I thought something was up, cos
Bethan is refusing to sit near
Alex.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.567
We'll worry about that later,

28:30.633 --> 28:33.167
cos we've gotta test out
these pure powerboats.

28:33.233 --> 28:37.000
I can't believe this is what
you guys do for fun in
Newcastle.

28:38.933 --> 28:41.700
Yeah!
Oh, my God!

28:41.767 --> 28:43.867
'Right now,
it's awkward with Bethan.'

28:43.933 --> 28:46.267
Hopefully
this will take our minds off it.

28:46.333 --> 28:49.300
This is good for a hangover.
Sorts you right out.

28:49.367 --> 28:52.700
I'm having a good time.
Powerboating is actually
amazing.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.533
Oh, my God! Woo!

28:55.600 --> 28:57.100
Woo-hoo!

28:57.167 --> 28:59.433
Right,
my hangover is actually no more.

29:02.367 --> 29:05.667
Right, I hope you enjoyed
Geordie Tours. It was fuckin'
mint.

29:05.733 --> 29:07.167
One more time.
(laughter)

29:07.233 --> 29:10.967
Powerboating's been mint craic.
But Scotty T's work is not yet
done.

29:11.033 --> 29:13.367
Oh, get this off now.

29:13.433 --> 29:14.967
Did yous have fun?
Yeah.

29:15.033 --> 29:16.833
Well, the day's not over yet.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.067
Living in the house together
is amazing,

29:19.133 --> 29:21.900
but when there's a problem,
there's nowhere to hide.

29:21.967 --> 29:24.100
I don't know why
these divvies fell out,

29:24.167 --> 29:26.567
but they need to nip it
clean in the arse.

29:26.633 --> 29:28.900
You aren't leaving
until you sort it out.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.567
You can give your side first,
if you want.

29:31.633 --> 29:34.733
I feel like you were an easy
target.
I do apologise.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.533
I shouldn't blame you
for my relationship issues.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.733
It's not your fault.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.133
Me and Beau have been up and
down
so much,

29:41.200 --> 29:44.267
maybe I have took it out on Alex
and he doesn't deserve it.

29:44.333 --> 29:47.500
You coming in and sticking
your oar in, easy target for
her,

29:47.567 --> 29:50.667
because you went about it
not in a very cool way.

29:50.733 --> 29:53.400
When you first came in,
you were a laugh and stuff.

29:53.467 --> 29:56.533
Now it's a bit intense
and you're acting like a
dickhead.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.700
It wasn't my intention
to get in between Bethan and
Beau.

29:59.767 --> 30:02.800
But now I can see
how my actions have come across.

30:02.867 --> 30:08.000
I genuinely apologise and I'm
not
gonna get involved in this any
more.

30:08.067 --> 30:12.000
It's good to finally hear an
apology
off Alex, cos that's all I
wanted.

30:12.067 --> 30:13.767
Yous all friends?
Yeah. Yeah.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.733
Come on, give us a hug then.
(laughs)

30:15.800 --> 30:19.233
That's what boring bastards
would call a good day in the
office.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.833
Fucking what have I become?

30:20.900 --> 30:24.433
Be safe. No fuckin' arguments.
See ya later. Bye!

30:33.633 --> 30:35.633
Beau, do you want to have a
chat?
Aye.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.767
When me and Sam
were having a bad time,

30:37.833 --> 30:41.367
Bethan was there for us. That's
what best friends do for each
other.

30:41.433 --> 30:44.300
I need to speak to Beau today
and see what's going on.

30:44.367 --> 30:46.867
It's starting to hurt
and affect us now,

30:46.933 --> 30:49.233
seeing my best friend cry
because of you.

30:49.300 --> 30:52.400
Her being upset does upset me.
I know that I like the girl.

30:52.467 --> 30:55.167
But I can't just go
jumping back into it.

30:55.233 --> 30:58.633
That's not how it works.
Not for me anyways. Oh, my God,
man.

30:58.700 --> 30:59.900
I don't...
Be honest.

30:59.967 --> 31:02.067
I don't like looking vulnerable.

31:02.133 --> 31:03.800
Have you been hurt in the past?

31:03.867 --> 31:06.367
It's more that the only time
I ever doubt myself

31:06.433 --> 31:08.433
is when I'm going through a
breakup.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.700
The only time
I ever question myself.

31:10.767 --> 31:13.333
After my last relationship,
I was a broken man,

31:13.400 --> 31:16.167
and it took me ages
to put the pieces back together.

31:16.233 --> 31:19.433
So that's why I want to take it
slow
with Bethan.

31:19.500 --> 31:22.733
It's hard, man. I'm not used
to this sort of shit, like.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.300
Being in this sort of position
with a lass, like.

31:25.367 --> 31:29.667
I'll tell you this. I'm very,
very
insecure about myself. Right?

31:29.733 --> 31:33.467
Don't want to get upset.
(breathes deeply)

31:33.533 --> 31:37.533
I'm sorry. I didn't think
I'd be crying to you today.
(sobs)

31:37.600 --> 31:40.867
So, I understand where you come
from,
cos obviously,

31:40.933 --> 31:43.400
like, before I met Sam,

31:43.467 --> 31:47.967
I was really hurt.
And it really affected us.

31:48.033 --> 31:50.033
And obviously, I'm always, like,

31:50.100 --> 31:52.600
waiting for Sam
to fuck up the relationship

31:52.667 --> 31:55.800
cos I'm so used to getting hurt.

31:55.867 --> 32:00.067
And now that I've finally told
Sam
about, like, how I actually
feel,

32:00.133 --> 32:01.600
he's been so much better.

32:01.667 --> 32:05.100
Now I just wish that I was
more honest with him in the
start.

32:05.167 --> 32:08.833
'Beau is saying that he bottles
things up and I used to do
that.'

32:08.900 --> 32:12.367
But now I've got everything out
in the open, it is so much
better.

32:12.433 --> 32:14.167
So, maybe he should do the same.

32:14.233 --> 32:17.133
I just don't want to see her
hurt.
I'm not gonna hurt her.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.900
I just hope it hasn't gone too
far,
so I can't sort it out.

32:20.967 --> 32:24.100
But if it is, then I guess it
is,
do you know what I mean?

32:29.067 --> 32:31.200
This is like a different Beau.

32:31.267 --> 32:32.567
Great.

32:33.767 --> 32:35.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:37.933 --> 32:38.133
.

32:40.667 --> 32:40.867
.

32:50.867 --> 32:54.300
I've got you a pizza. It's
freezing
so I'll put it on your head.

32:54.367 --> 32:56.133
There, that's better.
Aw.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.000
Thank you, babe.
OK.

32:59.833 --> 33:03.000
Hello, bitches!
Oi, oi! (cheering)

33:03.067 --> 33:05.633
Ooh, is it raining?!

33:05.700 --> 33:08.367
It was so good.
Really? What did yous do?

33:08.433 --> 33:10.800
We went powerboating.
Oh, I'm so jealous!

33:10.867 --> 33:13.100
It didn't feel like work.
Yous made up then?

33:13.167 --> 33:14.433
Yeah. Yeah.
Good.

33:14.500 --> 33:17.533
Thank found Alex and Bethan
have sorted things out.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.333
Let's get ready
and let's just have a good
night.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.933
I need a good, stiff drink.

33:26.800 --> 33:30.967
Oh, my God. Agh!
Oh, my hair's wet.

33:32.800 --> 33:36.433
I've been single for four years
now,
and I just enjoy being single.

33:36.500 --> 33:39.467
When I've been in a
relationship,
it has got intense fast

33:39.533 --> 33:42.267
and shit's happened
but we still stayed together.

33:42.333 --> 33:45.633
After talking to Chloe, I feel
like
I've been unfair to Bethan,

33:45.700 --> 33:47.800
and I need to open up
about my feelings.

33:47.867 --> 33:50.733
I'm lucky I've got Nathan
to help me work through them.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.667
Are you gonna talk to Bethan?
Yeah.

33:52.733 --> 33:55.333
It'll probably bring yous
closer.

33:55.400 --> 33:59.033
I need to learn how to open up
more
to people that I care about.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.533
Nathan's helped me realise
what I need to do,

34:01.600 --> 34:03.500
tell Bethan how I feel about
her.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.433
But for me, it's not that easy.

34:05.500 --> 34:09.333
You're my new brother. I've got
a
new brother. A new bond has
formed.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.667
I really like Beau,
he's a canny lad.

34:11.733 --> 34:16.233
And I'm glad he spoke to me
whilst naked in the bathtub.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.000
You just sat on your dick.
I know.

34:18.067 --> 34:20.467
Get it then.
It's like a cushion it's that
big.

34:20.533 --> 34:24.067
It's not, I've just seen it.
It is pretty big, mate.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.467
I had a really good chat
with Beau today.

34:31.533 --> 34:33.500
I think he's scared of getting
hurt.

34:33.567 --> 34:35.967
'I understand Beau
a little bit better.'

34:36.033 --> 34:39.233
I just hope he can open up to
Bethan
like he opened up to me,

34:39.300 --> 34:42.632
cos I believe they've got
something
worth fighting for.

34:42.699 --> 34:45.400
I'm just gonna wait
until he's ready to speak to me.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.699
Yeah, I agree. Let him come to
you.

34:47.766 --> 34:51.266
I'm just gonna finish contouring
this so everyone shut up.

35:05.667 --> 35:08.133
Everyone!
I know Sam's not coming out
tonight

35:08.200 --> 35:09.767
and he's gonna be missed.

35:09.833 --> 35:12.867
But I think tonight
is going to be a very good
night.

35:12.933 --> 35:17.433
Let's just have such a good
night!
(all cheer, shout)

35:17.500 --> 35:20.400
Me and Sam had such a lovely
night
last night staying in,

35:20.467 --> 35:22.033
but he has got the shits now.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.833
I am going out.
Sorry, love, you're on your own.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.100
(Alex) Get in the car!

35:37.367 --> 35:40.767
Tonight, everyone's in a good
mood
and nothing can ruin it.

35:40.833 --> 35:43.467
It's just a shame that
Sam isn't here to see at all.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.100
(cheering)

36:04.067 --> 36:06.733
It's not like me
to talk about my feelings to a
girl,

36:06.800 --> 36:10.000
but I'm gonna talk to Bethan
tonight. I am shitting myself.

36:15.267 --> 36:18.733
The sooner Beau talks to Bethan,
the better it is for everyone

36:18.800 --> 36:21.800
cos then at least we know
there's gonna be no kick-offs.

36:33.467 --> 36:36.933
Right, here we go. It's time to
get
this chat with Bethan out the
way

36:37.000 --> 36:38.767
before I get too smashed.

37:08.300 --> 37:12.067
Just being close to Bethan
feels nice. I have missed the
girl.

37:19.833 --> 37:23.733
I cannot believe it.
This is like a different Beau.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.800
This is the most honest
he's ever been with me.

37:38.367 --> 37:42.067
Oh, my God.
Two nights ago, Beau dumped us,

37:42.133 --> 37:46.367
and now he's only got eyes for
me.
I am absolutely buzzing.

37:50.467 --> 37:53.400
I'm glad me and Bethan
finally understand each other

37:53.467 --> 37:55.100
and she accepted my apology.

37:55.167 --> 37:57.267
Now we can get things back on
track.

37:59.667 --> 38:01.633
Woo!

38:01.700 --> 38:05.167
I am buzzing that Beau and
Bethan
have finally sorted things out.

38:05.233 --> 38:07.900
Them two belong together,
they're pure radge.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.600
I love that Bethan
is finally smiling again.

38:29.667 --> 38:32.300
Seeing her upset
has really hurt us.

38:36.233 --> 38:39.033
(cheering)
Let's go get smashed!

38:55.400 --> 38:58.133
Nathan is right.
I'm fed up of us three being
dragged

38:58.200 --> 39:01.400
into the relationship problems
of the couples in the house.

39:10.067 --> 39:12.867
If it's not a threesome,
then what the fuck is trouple?

39:16.767 --> 39:20.500
Hey, I've got a good name.
Let's call ourselves...

39:21.733 --> 39:23.000
(laughs)

39:23.067 --> 39:25.033
'No, Alex, that's shit.'

39:25.100 --> 39:29.400
I know. I've got it.
The three of us can be a tripod.

39:31.400 --> 39:36.200
A tripod? The three of us
being single, having fun?

39:36.267 --> 39:37.833
That sounds like a bit of me.

39:54.067 --> 39:56.800
'Tonight has went
a lot better than I thought.'

39:56.867 --> 39:59.233
I have had a good night,
so hopefully now

39:59.300 --> 40:02.133
we can get back to the house
and have a cheeky cuddle.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.300
Woo!
(indistinct)

40:10.367 --> 40:11.900
(both shouting)

40:11.967 --> 40:15.833
Mans!
Howdy, howdy, let's get rowdy!

40:15.900 --> 40:18.233
Tonight has been amazing.
Cheers to that.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.967
Amazing! Amazing!

40:21.033 --> 40:24.700
I have had such an unreal night,
but I need to check on Sam

40:24.767 --> 40:27.733
and make sure that Natalie's
food
hasn't killed him.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.267
Great. Chloe has woken me up.

40:32.333 --> 40:34.200
She's definitely had a skinful.

40:36.233 --> 40:40.067
It looks like I'll be looking
after
her instead of her looking after
me.

40:45.067 --> 40:48.533
I'm gonna get naked, let it
happen.
Whatever happens happens.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.800
I can't be arsed
with these lot anymore.

40:50.867 --> 40:52.700
I'm taking Bethan to the
bedroom.

40:52.767 --> 40:55.067
I'm not doing anything with you.
What?

40:55.133 --> 40:58.733
I'm not doing anything. Just cos
you're in that sexy little
outfit.

40:59.733 --> 41:01.800
Can I eat my salad and go to
bed?

41:01.867 --> 41:05.433
Chloe's ditched us to go to bed
with
Sam, Bethan goes to bed with
Beau,

41:05.500 --> 41:09.033
and I'm taking a salad do bed.
Who's the real winner here?

41:11.333 --> 41:12.800
Tahlia got it.
That's you.

41:12.867 --> 41:15.767
Why is everyone going to bed?
They're boring as hell.

41:15.833 --> 41:18.967
'The tripod keeps the party
going.'
Take off something.

41:19.033 --> 41:21.733
Take your top off.
You're gonna end up naked, boy!

41:21.800 --> 41:25.600
It's amazing how I can get this
bottle to stop where I want it
to.

41:25.667 --> 41:28.400
'It's a good thing Alex
hasn't figured it out yet.'

41:28.467 --> 41:31.667
If this spins on you now,
then you're out the game.

41:31.733 --> 41:33.133
I know that.

41:34.467 --> 41:36.867
Oh!
Oh!

41:36.933 --> 41:38.933
You need to get in the hot tub
now,
mate.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.667
You can hold...
Oh, my God, I just seen your
hoop.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.500
How is his bumhole hair free?

41:43.567 --> 41:46.933
I'm starkers already.
This game must have been rigged,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.600
but hey, let's keep the fun
going
in the hot tub.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.833
I dare you to neck on with
Tahlia.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.767
Alex, that's not a dare at all.

42:04.433 --> 42:06.200
So passionate.
Oh, my God!

42:06.267 --> 42:09.700
Nathan is such a good kisser.
I kind of wish that he wasn't
gay.

42:09.767 --> 42:11.467
I dare you to snog Alex.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.967
Ooh!
Alex, you're actually a good
kisser.

42:18.033 --> 42:20.367
I'm a firm believer
that you only live once,

42:20.433 --> 42:23.700
but the thought of getting
with Nathan doesn't float my
boat.

42:26.700 --> 42:31.333
The only thing that's gonna
cement
the tripod is a three-way neck
on.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.467
So, come on, boys and girls,
get your tongues out.

42:36.067 --> 42:37.767
(all laugh)

42:37.833 --> 42:39.467
Someone was biting my lip!

42:39.533 --> 42:40.733
It's been a good night,

42:40.800 --> 42:43.933
but I'm gonna get the fuck to
bed
before I do something else.

42:45.067 --> 42:46.967
You've got a boner!

42:56.967 --> 42:59.867
Yes, get in. I am fuckin'
buzzing.

43:01.100 --> 43:04.133
(moaning)

43:09.833 --> 43:13.100
Pack up all your shit
cos you're going to fuckin'
Cardiff.

43:13.167 --> 43:15.833
I am buzzing.
My brother lives down there.

43:15.900 --> 43:18.300
Be still my beating vagina.

43:18.367 --> 43:19.700
(all) Cardiff! Cardiff!

43:20.800 --> 43:23.600
I ride dicks, not bulls.

43:23.667 --> 43:25.133
It's in my eye!

43:25.200 --> 43:27.400
I feel like I'm in
a bit of a relationship.

43:27.467 --> 43:30.433
I wouldn't say it's serious.
I wanna take it slow.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.567
What the fuck is that noise?

43:34.467 --> 43:37.933
Water rafting and rope climbing,
I am buzzing.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.233
It's good to have my brother
out finally.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.367
Harvey is huge.

44:09.433 --> 44:09.633
.
