as elaborate as usual.

- No!
- Ophelia! Ophelia!

19:35.354 --> 19:37.989
Why the fuck
did you chain me up

19:38.023 --> 19:39.390
next to this fucking worm?

19:39.425 --> 19:41.325
You know that I hate
his fucking guts.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.662
Oh, Marcy.
That's the spirit!

19:44.696 --> 19:45.963
You know what?

19:45.998 --> 19:47.665
I was gonna fuckin' chop off

19:47.699 --> 19:50.501
his pathetic, little
fuckin' excuse for a penis

19:50.536 --> 19:52.837
and feed it to my cats.

19:52.871 --> 19:54.472
But maybe you should do it.

19:54.506 --> 19:55.907
Yeah, maybe I should.

19:55.941 --> 19:57.508
I'll cut it off.
I'll eat it myself.

19:57.543 --> 19:58.910
- Oh!
- Okay?

19:58.944 --> 20:00.144
I got a better idea.

20:00.179 --> 20:01.979
Let's make soup out of it.

20:02.014 --> 20:04.849
- Fuck yeah, cock soup!
- Yeah.

20:04.883 --> 20:06.350
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, okay.

20:06.385 --> 20:09.654
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

20:09.688 --> 20:12.490
- There you go.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

20:12.524 --> 20:14.625
That's great.
That's really...

20:14.660 --> 20:16.694
- Good!
- [Grunts] Ow!

20:16.728 --> 20:18.296
I'm not gonna cut his dick off,

20:18.330 --> 20:19.630
you crazy bitch.

20:19.665 --> 20:21.365
And being a fucking feminist

20:21.400 --> 20:24.802
is not about castrating men,
you kooky cunt.

20:24.837 --> 20:27.371
It's about learning to coexist

20:27.406 --> 20:29.006
with these dumb fucks.

20:29.041 --> 20:32.677
And sucking a dick
every once in a while

20:32.711 --> 20:36.347
is not about surrendering
your fuckin' sheness--

20:36.381 --> 20:38.716
which isn't even a word.

20:40.419 --> 20:42.153
And your books are unreadable.

20:42.187 --> 20:44.555
That was
a very beautiful speech, Marcy.

20:44.590 --> 20:46.824
You're a very strong
and beautiful woman.

20:46.859 --> 20:49.994
And you should be fuckin' lucky

20:50.028 --> 20:53.331
you made any cash
off of them at all.

20:53.365 --> 20:54.565
[Taser buzzes]
Oh, fuck!

20:54.600 --> 20:57.068
That fuckin' hurts!

20:57.102 --> 20:58.836
Damn it!

21:00.272 --> 21:03.207

21:03.242 --> 21:06.043
[Panting]
Oh, my God.

21:06.078 --> 21:07.378
Can I try?

21:07.412 --> 21:09.714
- No!
- What?

21:09.748 --> 21:11.048
Okay, just once.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.284
We don't wanna kill her.

21:13.352 --> 21:15.086
Just do one more--
[Taser buzzes]

21:15.120 --> 21:16.521
- Okay!
- Whoo-hoo!

21:16.555 --> 21:18.189
- That is a lot of fun.
- It worked.

21:18.223 --> 21:19.357
That's why I'm gonna
do it one more time.

21:19.391 --> 21:20.992
On the toe.

you motherfucker.

22:17.616 --> 22:19.717
- I thought the tour was off.
- Not anymore.

22:19.751 --> 22:21.819
I'm back on drugs,
and I'm better than ever.

22:21.853 --> 22:23.387
Yeah, he is!

22:23.422 --> 22:25.823
I-I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

22:25.857 --> 22:28.893

to get remarried.

22:28.927 --> 22:31.062
No. I tell you
what I will do though,

22:31.096 --> 22:32.964
for both of you,

22:33.031 --> 22:34.966
I'll fuckin' marry you fuckers

22:35.000 --> 22:37.368
on the stage, at the Greek!

22:37.436 --> 22:38.836
I'm a licensed minister.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.538
Of course you are.

22:40.572 --> 22:42.506
What do you think?

22:42.541 --> 22:45.242
Fuck yeah.
Why not?

22:45.277 --> 22:46.944
And then you can bring
your spunky, little fuck bunny

22:46.979 --> 22:49.013
up on the road with us,
and I can finish eating

22:49.047 --> 22:51.749
that chocolate bar out of
her sweet, little, girly bits.

22:51.783 --> 22:52.984
- Okay.
- It's good to be the king!

22:53.051 --> 22:54.285
- Okay.
- Whoo-hoo!

22:54.319 --> 22:56.087
- You guys are coming, right?
- What?

22:56.121 --> 22:57.455
On tour.

22:57.489 --> 22:59.123
We gotta keep writing
this musical.

22:59.157 --> 23:01.158
I write incredibly well
on tour.

23:01.193 --> 23:02.860
I find it inspiring.

23:02.894 --> 23:04.695
Sounds like an adventure.

23:04.730 --> 23:06.964
Think about it,
and then say yes.

23:06.999 --> 23:09.967
I'm gonna go to bed and show
this dedicated fan girl

23:10.002 --> 23:13.537
what it's like to be penetrated
by a ginger God.

23:13.572 --> 23:14.805
No, you are gonna see
what it's like

23:14.840 --> 23:16.774
to get raped by a tweaker!

23:16.808 --> 23:19.010
- Watch that, shit's intense.
- Holy shit.

23:19.044 --> 23:20.324
One of us
is gonna bleed tonight,

23:20.345 --> 23:21.846
and I ain't gonna be me.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.482
I can hardly wait.

23:35.594 --> 23:38.529
I'm gonna miss you, squirt.
[Kisses]

23:38.563 --> 23:40.731
I'll miss you too, dad.

23:40.766 --> 23:43.167
- But it's time to go.
- Yeah.

23:43.201 --> 23:44.568
I need a change of scenery.

23:44.603 --> 23:45.836
I know that feeling.

23:45.871 --> 23:47.605
So hit the road.

23:47.639 --> 23:49.240
What's keeping you?

23:49.274 --> 23:51.308
The truth?

23:51.343 --> 23:53.044
I guess I'm always hoping
that your mom

23:53.111 --> 23:56.247
will take me back,
give me another chance.

23:56.281 --> 23:58.382
Maybe that's your problem, dad.

23:58.417 --> 24:01.085
You see it as winning her back.

24:01.119 --> 24:03.387
But there's no winning
in this game.

24:03.422 --> 24:06.557
You're not some white knight
on a steed.

24:06.591 --> 24:09.427
She's not
some fairy tale princess.

24:09.461 --> 24:13.164
She's just
as fucked up as you are...

24:13.198 --> 24:15.366
and just as incredible.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.767
You know what's funny?

24:16.802 --> 24:18.102
What?

24:18.136 --> 24:19.737
You talk a good game
about living,

24:19.771 --> 24:21.372
loving and fucking
and fighting,

24:21.406 --> 24:23.040
but this whole time,

24:23.075 --> 24:25.543
I've only seen you
with that guy--

24:25.577 --> 24:27.511
troll doll.

24:27.546 --> 24:30.948
Yeah, I can't seem
to scrape him off my shoe.

24:30.982 --> 24:33.150
Uh-oh, that's like the beginning

24:33.185 --> 24:36.120
to every great love story
I know.

24:36.154 --> 24:41.258
He's one of the good guys, dad.

24:41.293 --> 24:42.860
He told me he loved me
last night.

24:42.894 --> 24:44.428
Of course he did.

24:44.463 --> 24:47.465
What took him so long?

24:49.901 --> 24:51.781
Does she have any allergies
I should know about?

24:51.803 --> 24:55.773
Uh, penicillin and lameness.

24:55.807 --> 24:57.074
I know I've failed to make

24:57.109 --> 24:58.442
an excellent impression
on you, sir.

24:58.477 --> 24:59.844
Yeah.

24:59.878 --> 25:01.879
But I really do
enjoy your daughter.

25:01.913 --> 25:03.647
I'm sorry.
"Enjoy" sounds dirty.

25:03.682 --> 25:05.716
And I do enjoy her in that way,
you know, like, sexually.

25:05.784 --> 25:07.451
No.
No, no, no.

25:07.486 --> 25:09.086
But I'm really talking
about the other way, you know?

25:09.121 --> 25:10.654
Like, I love her brain.

25:10.689 --> 25:13.124
She's better than me
and smarter than me.

25:13.158 --> 25:15.226
And I'd like to support
and nurture that

25:15.260 --> 25:17.928
for as long as she'll let me.

25:17.963 --> 25:20.164
Sorry, I guess this is just
my long-winded way of saying

25:20.165 --> 25:23.567
I'll take very good care
of your daughter, sir.
