19:53.462 --> 19:55.254
Lubecky:
My house was foreclosed on.

19:55.337 --> 19:57.379
There were times
when I had no income,

19:57.462 --> 20:01.212
went into abandoned buildings,
pulled out copper so I
could buy ramen noodles.

20:01.296 --> 20:03.587
I'd never really thought
that I'd be doing anything

20:03.670 --> 20:06.045
other than
living in a van
down by the river.

20:06.129 --> 20:07.837
-And you thought
that was it for you?
-That's what I'm gonna do.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.587
That's the height of my
existence is getting high
every day,

20:10.670 --> 20:14.004
getting drunk every day,
and doing that until
my life expires.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.837
-Therapy hadn't worked.
-Not at all.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.920
-Prescription drugs
hadn't worked.
-I'd been through all of it.

20:18.004 --> 20:20.879
They threw every pill
imaginable at me.

20:20.962 --> 20:23.004
At one point I was on
42 pills a day

20:23.087 --> 20:24.545
between physical
and mental injuries.

20:24.628 --> 20:27.212
At that point,
I would try anything,

20:27.296 --> 20:29.421
even something
as crazy as Ecstasy.

20:29.503 --> 20:34.045
I'm here to say that
there is new hope
for the treatment of trauma.

20:34.129 --> 20:38.004
This hope is coming from a
psychedelic drug called MDMA.

20:38.628 --> 20:41.628
Anderson:
One of MDMA's
earliest proponents was
Dr. Rick Doblin.

20:41.712 --> 20:45.503
His work has been
hugely beneficial to veterans
and first responders,

20:45.587 --> 20:47.670
forcing even the Pentagon
to take note.

20:47.753 --> 20:52.171
I'm a draft resister. I was
prepared to go to jail instead
of going to Vietnam.

20:52.254 --> 20:55.212
But now all these years later,
we're being invited
into the Pentagon

20:55.296 --> 20:58.045
to talk to them about MDMA
therapy for veterans.

20:58.129 --> 21:00.129
Anderson:
Rick founded
the nonprofit MAPS,

21:00.212 --> 21:04.587
the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic
Studies, back in 1986,

21:04.670 --> 21:08.254
a year after
the Reagan Administration
made the drug illegal.

21:08.337 --> 21:11.254
We knew about
therapeutic use of MDMA
from the middle '70s,

21:11.337 --> 21:13.879
and just think about
how many suicides
would have been prevented,

21:13.962 --> 21:15.628
how much suffering
would have been prevented.

21:15.712 --> 21:18.087
It's a national crisis,
and in a crisis,
people are willing

21:18.171 --> 21:21.212
to look at things
that they weren't
otherwise willing to look at.

21:21.296 --> 21:24.587
Anderson:
After 42 years,
Rick has almost succeeded.

21:24.670 --> 21:26.296
In Phase Two
of the MAPS study,

21:26.379 --> 21:30.296
68 percent of participants
no longer qualified for PTSD.

21:30.379 --> 21:32.212
Doblin:
There's a major change
taking place now,

21:32.296 --> 21:34.670
in the attitudes,
and it's because
they're desperate.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.753
Because the VA
has tried everything else.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.837
And there's a shifting
around the whole concept
of prohibition.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.962
We have the legalization
of marijuana here in
Massachusetts,

21:43.045 --> 21:45.212
so that's why
I'm not hiding
my bong.

21:46.254 --> 21:49.296
Even under Trump and Sessions,
the FDA was not scared to say,

21:49.379 --> 21:50.795
"This is a breakthrough
therapy."

21:50.879 --> 21:52.795
Anderson:
Even Fox News is open
to the idea,

21:52.879 --> 21:55.212
because helping veterans
may be one of the few

21:55.296 --> 21:56.587
non-partisan issues left.

21:56.670 --> 21:58.628
But I think there is definitely
a genuine interest

21:58.712 --> 22:01.087
in trying to do the best
for our men and women
that served.

22:01.171 --> 22:03.171
Greg Gutfeld:
I think that there was a group
of psychotherapists

22:03.254 --> 22:05.296
who were really, really angry

22:05.379 --> 22:07.254
when a valuable tool
was taken from them.

22:07.337 --> 22:10.004
And I can't remember the guy
who's in charge-- Dubrin,
I think, or Dubul.

22:10.087 --> 22:12.920
I can't think of the guy's name,
but he's been pioneering
all of this.

22:13.004 --> 22:15.962
They didn't
once mention
MDMA and therapy.

22:16.045 --> 22:17.962
-No.
-They seem to have missed
the entire point.

22:18.045 --> 22:22.087
Did you ever think you'd be
doing a pro Ecstasy segment
on Fox News?

22:22.171 --> 22:24.837
-No, uh...

22:24.920 --> 22:26.421
Anderson:
We spoke to one vet

22:26.503 --> 22:28.296
who says he experienced
lasting impact

22:28.379 --> 22:31.670
and a whole new way of thinkig
after just one session.

22:31.753 --> 22:34.462
I just went from
feeling anxious to...

22:34.545 --> 22:36.753
feeling completely relaxed.

22:36.837 --> 22:40.004
Things happened,
and people are dead, and...

22:40.087 --> 22:44.503
my way of not accepting it
was role-playing in my mind,

22:44.587 --> 22:46.753
about other scenarios on how...

22:46.837 --> 22:49.545
Okay, if I would have
done this and been there,
then...

22:49.628 --> 22:51.837
maybe something
could have changed.

22:51.920 --> 22:55.670
One of the realizations
that I had was, I put myself
in their shoes.

22:55.753 --> 22:59.171
There's no way,
if I was to die over there,
I'd want someone

22:59.254 --> 23:01.545
suffering the rest
of their life.

23:01.628 --> 23:05.254
And, uh, I would want them
living their life,

23:05.337 --> 23:06.837
and being successful.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.587
So, enjoy family,
enjoy friends,

23:09.670 --> 23:11.670
because I'm still able to.

23:11.753 --> 23:14.337
Anderson:
Scientists at Yale are
beginning to understand

23:14.421 --> 23:17.421
what makes MDMA
potentially so effective.

23:17.503 --> 23:21.171
I got my brain scanned
by two doctors at Yale
who are working with the VA

23:21.254 --> 23:24.087
on advancing breakthrough
PTSD treatments.

23:24.171 --> 23:27.004
Dr. Chadi Abdallah:
If we look at all PTSD
symptoms together,

23:27.087 --> 23:30.712
numbness, arousal,
avoidance, flashback,

23:30.795 --> 23:34.254
we see that the main issue
on average is reduction
of connectivity

23:34.337 --> 23:36.753
in the interior
hippocampus,
this area,

23:36.837 --> 23:38.879
and the amygdala, as well,
which is in front of it.

23:38.962 --> 23:44.462
The more numbness they have,
the less overall connectivity
they have in these areas.

23:44.545 --> 23:47.337
Anderson:
Early studies suggest that MDA
and other psychedelics

23:47.421 --> 23:51.587
may enhance the brain's abiliy
to recover after traumatic
experiences.

23:51.670 --> 23:55.087
Maybe MDMA
opens the window
of plasticity,

23:55.171 --> 24:00.421
recreating or re-enhancing
the ability for
new emotional learning,

24:00.503 --> 24:02.503
new social learning.

24:02.587 --> 24:06.087
Think about it as
you have a kind of
psychological roadblock,

24:06.171 --> 24:09.837
and this is-- You get this
window to overcome
this roadblock,

24:09.920 --> 24:13.087
and have a different psychology
that gets you out of
this viscous cycle.

24:13.171 --> 24:16.545
What is the potential for this?
What is the potential for MDMA?

24:16.628 --> 24:20.462
There's a real potential
for it to become
part of the mainstream

24:20.545 --> 24:22.004
of PTSD treatment.

24:22.087 --> 24:25.296
It's almost like
the rules of the game
are changing right...

24:25.379 --> 24:27.171
right in front of us.

24:27.254 --> 24:31.503
Anderson:
For now, MDMA remains illegal
outside of the clinical trial.

24:31.587 --> 24:36.129
To undergo the therapy myself,
I had to travel abroad.

24:36.795 --> 24:38.920
When I'd started talking
to people about this,

24:39.004 --> 24:42.587

24:42.670 --> 24:46.337

you idiot."

24:50.212 --> 24:54.045
