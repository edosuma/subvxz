[Gossip Girl]
Gossip girl here,
your one and only source

00:03.960 --> 00:05.440
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.485
I fired Andrew Tyler,
that private investigator.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.661
Thank you, but I don't
think that that's enough.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.228
- 'Where's Bart?'
- I'm leaving him.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.187
I'm doing it for me.
I don't expect anything.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.363
Lily's at the ball
with Rufus Humphrey.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.929
'You should figure something out
and down get here now.'

00:17.017 --> 00:18.235
I wouldn't change us.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.758
Not if it meant
losing what we have.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.543
And what do we have, Chuck?
You tell me.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.110
[Dan]
It was meaningful with you.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.416
I-it was the greatest night
of my life.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.418
- Mine, too.
- Serena, where's Charles?

00:27.505 --> 00:29.768
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Bart's been in an accident.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.992
And who am I?

00:36.079 --> 00:39.387
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.128
You know you love me.

00:41.215 --> 00:44.087
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.178
More towers than trump

00:48.265 --> 00:50.746
more bucks than Bloomberg.

00:50.833 --> 00:54.793
Bart Bass definitely
made his mark on Manhattan.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.667
The passing of a public figure
can shake a whole town

00:58.754 --> 01:01.931
but the real story is always
the one happening in private.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.673
Away from the headlines..

01:05.935 --> 01:07.067
...at home.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.462
Ah. Come, eat.
You need your strength.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.421
- I'm not hungry.
- I'm saving room for later.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.684
In times of great uncertainty,
it's even more important

01:15.771 --> 01:17.555
that we continue
our daily rituals.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.731
You haven't eaten a Cheerio
since you've been here.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.951
And we-we know that's gin
in your coffee cup.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.953
'My point exactly.'

01:24.040 --> 01:26.521
Life must go on
as it always has.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.523
Come on.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.090
How's mom?

01:30.177 --> 01:32.048
I took her some coffee
and some toast.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.571
She didn't sleep
very much last night.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.356
Or any night since it happened.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.619
All she does is make lists
and yell at people.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.316
People mourn
in their own ways.

01:39.403 --> 01:40.622
What happens tonight
when it's all over

01:40.709 --> 01:42.406
and there's nothing left
for her to do?

01:42.493 --> 01:44.452
Maybe she'll move into the
palace and hole up with Chuck.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.976
Ah, yes, the bottomless minibar

01:47.063 --> 01:49.152
and the comfort of the twins
in room service.

01:49.239 --> 01:51.372
It's a scandal.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.374
People mourn in their own ways,
mother.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.897
I've been assured by the hotel

01:54.984 --> 01:57.595
that if Chuck isn't
alive and well..

01:57.682 --> 01:59.510
Well..

01:59.597 --> 02:01.947
..at least he's alive.

02:02.034 --> 02:05.125
Oh. That's a nice picture.

02:05.212 --> 02:08.650
Remind me to send a thank you
note to the photo editor.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.826
Is that tuna?

02:10.913 --> 02:12.523
Grandma, please talk to her.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.743
W-we're-we're
doing comfort food.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.832
Nobody's comforted
by a tuna tower.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.877
Fine.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.270
[sighs]

02:20.357 --> 02:21.924
- Darling, where are you going?
- Oh, out.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.405
- Uh, for a walk to the park.
- Well, is that wise?

02:24.492 --> 02:26.058
Well, it's really hot in here

02:26.146 --> 02:29.714
with the cooking
and the...cooking.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.673
I-I'll be-I'll be right back.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.813
[Mozart "Piano Concert No.21"]

02:48.820 --> 02:51.258
Oh, that's a good picture.

02:51.345 --> 02:54.522
Lily should send a thank you
note to the photo editor.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.567
How is, uh, Charles holding up?

02:56.654 --> 02:58.178
Who knows?

02:58.265 --> 03:00.223
He hasn't returned
any of my calls or texts.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.920
But the hotel says
they keep sending up food

03:02.007 --> 03:04.227
so there's something alive
in that room.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.186
Oh, you should try
some capers with that

03:06.273 --> 03:08.362
and just a tickle
of the sliced onion.

03:08.449 --> 03:11.016
Maybe I'm underestimating
his emotional bond

03:11.103 --> 03:12.627
with Kim and Kristi
from room service.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.194
But I just think
that at a time like this

03:14.281 --> 03:16.196
he should be with someone
who cares about him.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.806
Not enough. Not enough.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.722
That is exactly why
we are getting married

03:20.809 --> 03:22.985
so that we can always be around
to care for each other.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.509
- 'It's true.'
- It is.

03:25.596 --> 03:29.165
Just delivered, ma'am,
for your trip to Paris.

03:29.252 --> 03:32.037
[gasps]
Christmas in Paris.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.430
How can you even think
of your vacation

03:33.517 --> 03:36.520
the day that we're
putting Bart in the ground?

03:36.607 --> 03:38.305
Because, my dear

03:38.392 --> 03:40.916
in the midst of death,
we are in life.

03:43.658 --> 03:44.702
[whispers]
Genius.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.358
Maybe Nate's heard from Chuck.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.847
[knocking]

03:58.934 --> 04:00.196
- 'Hey.'
- Hey.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.806
- I wasn't expecting to see you.
- I know.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.156
I was just coming to check in
on you, see how you were.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.377
I'm fine. I'm just worried
about my mom and..

04:07.464 --> 04:09.118
...Eric...

04:09.205 --> 04:10.467
...and Chuck.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.513
[chuckles]
That's, uh, that's nice.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.210
I'm worried about you.

04:14.297 --> 04:19.259
Thank you so much for being such
a rock these past few days.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.217
It's meant
so much having you around.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.392
Yeah, well,
it's not a problem.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.003
I mean, it just..
It feels natural.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.005
It does, doesn't it?

04:30.139 --> 04:31.749
Hey, Serena.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.708
Aaron, hey.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.932
- Dan.
- Hey, Aaron.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.674
Uh, I-I just wanted to check in,
see how you were.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.502
Oh, yeah. I'm..
I was just telling Dan.

04:45.589 --> 04:49.506
I'm fine. But it-it's good
to see you a-and you.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.335
But, um, I'm actually
gonna go to the church

04:52.422 --> 04:55.991
with just my family,
so I'll see you both there?

04:56.078 --> 04:57.514
- Yeah, sure. Sounds good.
- Yeah. That's great.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.864
- See you there.
- Okay then.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.823
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.393
I'm sorry we haven't spoken
since the ball.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.569
I really appreciate
your messages.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.223
All I want to say
is that I'm here.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.530
If you want me to keep my
distance, I can do that, too.

05:13.617 --> 05:14.966
I, um..

05:15.053 --> 05:17.317
...can't imagine
what you're going through.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.667
Well, actually, you can
better than anyone else can.

05:19.754 --> 05:23.061
Everyone's so concerned
about the grieving widow

05:23.148 --> 05:25.368
but as much as I feel
shock and loss

05:25.455 --> 05:27.327
mostly I feelguilt.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.199
And I'm sure
you must be thinking

05:30.286 --> 05:31.635
a 100 thoughts right now.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.289
But, Lily,
you cannot blame yourself.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.378
Why not?
He was on his way to see me.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.424
I was..

05:37.511 --> 05:39.991
[sighs]
I was gonna end our marriage.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.211
Hey.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.560
It's okay.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.650
You hear me?

05:46.737 --> 05:50.045
Um, he left me a voice mail.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.177
Oh. What'd it say?

05:52.264 --> 05:53.657
I don't know.
I haven't listened to it.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.790
I've been too afraid,
you know, to hear his voice.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.531
Well, do you want to listen
to it right now?

05:57.618 --> 05:59.141
- I'll stay with you.
- Thank you.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.099
But I'll do it myself.
I have to get back.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.452
Lil..

06:05.539 --> 06:08.368
...I'm waiting
for you this time.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.935
Six months, six years,
I'll be here.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.811
[instrumental music]

06:23.861 --> 06:25.733
[music continues]

06:30.128 --> 06:32.043
[cell phone rings]

06:33.828 --> 06:35.699
[beeps]

06:36.657 --> 06:38.528
[instrumental music]

06:46.754 --> 06:49.321
- My condolences.
- Skip the sympathy.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.976
This is business.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.761
My father met with you
right before he died.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.589
I want to know
what you told him that night.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.766
I worked forMr.Bass.
Not you.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.202
And what I have

07:00.289 --> 07:02.900
you're not the only
party interested.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.599
I'm about to become very rich.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.470
Yeah, congrats.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.820
But there's someone else who's
about to come into some money

07:09.907 --> 07:12.127
and I think she might be
more motivated than you are.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.302
Lily?

07:14.999 --> 07:17.959
Bitch is the reason
my father is dead.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.177
I'll be in touch.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.354
You can buy me a drink.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.140
I'm sorry.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.142
I can't stay.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.233
If you'll excuse me..

07:33.322 --> 07:35.193
...I have to go
bury my father.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.331
They say that
when someone dies

07:42.418 --> 07:44.768
their secrets
are buried with them.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.857
But on the Upper East Side

07:46.944 --> 07:48.859
sometimes the dead still speak.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.475

'You have one unheard message.'

08:02.133 --> 08:04.005

'Lily, we need to talk.'

08:04.092 --> 08:05.572
'And not about how my wife
is making a fool of me'

08:05.659 --> 08:07.269
'with her old lover.'

08:07.356 --> 08:10.359
'I know the real reason you were
in that hospital in France.'

08:13.275 --> 08:15.146

[cell phone ringing]

08:32.599 --> 08:34.514
That was Serena.
She'll be here soon.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.428
[cell phone rings]

08:37.865 --> 08:39.475
- Yeah, I got that.
- Well, I got it first.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.348
Yeah, well,
it's probably my service.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.089
4-0-1 area code.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.918
Yeah, that's probably it.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.833
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.227
I just talked to Eric.
Uh, he said they're almost here.

08:52.314 --> 08:53.881
That's old news.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.543
[music continues]

09:07.764 --> 09:08.765
Hey.

09:08.852 --> 09:11.159
Hey.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.161
Hey, Eric.

09:15.729 --> 09:16.817
Come here.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.169
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.349
I'm gonna go
pay my respects to your mom.

09:27.436 --> 09:31.222
Thank you.
She'll really appreciate that.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.441
How you holding up?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.922
Holding.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.967
Have you seen Jonathan?

09:37.054 --> 09:39.666
No. Why? Are you guys
back together?

09:39.753 --> 09:41.972
No. No, I..

09:42.059 --> 09:43.626
...just thought
he might want to be here.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.323
Yeah, that'll be fine.
Thank you.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.068
I see Daniel
and his sister are here.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.984
Will their father be making
an appearance today as well?

09:54.071 --> 09:56.378
Ugh. Why on earth
would you ask that?

09:56.465 --> 09:58.815
I followed you
to the park today.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.556
Of course you did, mother.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.558
We'll talk later.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.259
Where is Charles?

10:08.346 --> 10:09.565
We should've just
driven him to the door

10:09.652 --> 10:10.610
and dropped him off
on the steps.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.133
No one should
see him like this.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.525
He needs to walk it off.
Okay, walk, Chuck.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.267
Bend knee, lift foot.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.139
Maybe we should have
just left him at the palace.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.444
It's his father's funeral.

10:19.531 --> 10:20.881
He needs to be here
and show his respect.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.622
Respect?

10:22.709 --> 10:25.929
Father wasn't showing much
of that in his final days.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.757
- What's he talking about?
- Who knows?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.716
When we found him, his shoes
were on the wrong feet.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.152
Chuck, remember how
in the eighth grade you used

10:31.239 --> 10:32.240
'to help yourself
to the decanter'

10:32.327 --> 10:33.458
'in the captain's library?'

10:33.545 --> 10:35.243
First got my taste
for single malt.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.506
That's right and you'd have to
go home to a four course dinner

10:37.593 --> 10:38.855
without passing
on your consomme.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.510
I didn't want my father
