01:23.150 --> 01:24.450
Hey, Ash. Where are we?

01:24.458 --> 01:26.850
Well, we just crossed
the Tennessee border.

01:33.050 --> 01:35.650
- Which would put us...
- Yeah?

01:41.860 --> 01:43.750
Which would put us...

01:47.832 --> 01:49.875
Right...

01:52.216 --> 01:52.826
...Here!

01:55.120 --> 01:56.223
Turn!

02:01.450 --> 02:03.650
What the hell was that?
Are you trying to kill us?

02:03.652 --> 02:08.449
Don't blame me! It's your steering wheel!
Damn thing jerked right out of my hands.

02:08.455 --> 02:11.950
I don't understand it.
I had this thing in for a tune-up yesterday
and they said they'd go over everything.

02:11.955 --> 02:17.050
Well you better take it back
because the damn thing don't work.
The one thing that does work is this lousy horn.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.550
Go to hell!
I'm not honking at you!

02:26.130 --> 02:27.960
Jesus Christ!

02:28.050 --> 02:30.450
Hey Scotty!
What's this place like anyway?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.250
Well, the guy that's renting it
says it's an old place.

02:33.391 --> 02:37.250
Little run down,
but it's right up in the mountains.

02:37.850 --> 02:39.850
Yeah, and the best part
is that we get it so cheap.

02:39.858 --> 02:41.550
Why are we getting it so cheap?

02:42.127 --> 02:44.901
Well, I don't know.
Might be in real bad shape.

02:45.350 --> 02:48.050
You mean, nobody's
seen this place yet?

02:48.058 --> 02:50.750
- Well, not yet.
- Well, it might not be that bad.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.750
- No.
- Actually, it might be kind of nice.

02:53.950 --> 02:57.350
- Yeah.
- It's probably a real pit!

02:58.350 --> 03:00.250
I think this is where we get off.

03:05.450 --> 03:10.550
- This is the bridge we're going to cross?
- Jesus Christ! The whole thing's falling apart on us!

03:11.550 --> 03:16.350
Don't let the noise fool you girls,
this thing's solid as a rock.

05:30.050 --> 05:32.450
It's supposed to be
one of these on here.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.450
<i>Join Us!</i>

08:05.480 --> 08:06.780
<i>Join Us!</i>

09:21.850 --> 09:26.040
Dead bodies in the cellar.
Dead bodies in the cellar.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.285
Will you stop it?

09:27.750 --> 09:32.950
I would very much like to make
a toast for all this evening.

09:36.150 --> 09:39.106
Ah, as a Greek friend of mine once said...

09:40.280 --> 09:41.403
He said...

09:43.460 --> 09:44.700
I...

09:46.685 --> 09:48.001
Ok, Ok, Ok...

09:48.093 --> 09:49.701
Nis, nis...

09:51.210 --> 09:54.360
...Tu, Tu, Tu...
Tu, Ta, Rim.

09:54.450 --> 09:55.950
Which means?

09:55.955 --> 09:57.750
Party down!
Yeah!

10:20.450 --> 10:21.350
What is this?

10:22.750 --> 10:24.850
Whatever it is,
it's still down there.

10:26.050 --> 10:29.150
I don't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.

10:30.050 --> 10:31.850
It's probably just some animal.

10:32.650 --> 10:35.712
An animal?
An animal?

10:37.150 --> 10:39.550
That is the stupidest thing I
ever heard of. Jesus Christ!

10:41.250 --> 10:43.250
There's something down there.

10:46.550 --> 10:48.450
Maybe it is just some animal.

10:49.150 --> 10:52.150
Yeah, you're probably right.
Probably just some animal.

10:52.550 --> 10:54.850
Cheryl, why don't you go down
and check, make sure?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.750
Scotty!
I'm not going down there!

10:57.355 --> 11:00.050
Ok, Ok you cowards.
I'll go.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.051
Be careful.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.520
Back in a minute.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.050
Hey Scotty!
You find anything?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.150
Scotty!

11:42.300 --> 11:43.250
Scotty?!

11:48.950 --> 11:49.850
Scott!

11:53.750 --> 11:55.350
He's just kidding around...

11:58.061 --> 12:00.840
- Isn't he?
- Scotty!!

12:02.560 --> 12:03.660
Scott!

12:04.172 --> 12:05.750
Linda, get me a flashlight.

12:05.755 --> 12:07.550
That's the only
one we brought up.

12:07.555 --> 12:08.450
Then get the lantern.

13:28.255 --> 13:29.255
Scotty?!

14:45.073 --> 14:46.247
Boo!!

14:49.350 --> 14:51.550
Hey! Come here,
I wanna show you something.

14:54.050 --> 14:55.250
Look at all this stuff.

15:06.350 --> 15:07.750
I bet this still shoots.

15:08.206 --> 15:09.250
Probably does.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.476
Oh!...God!

15:21.650 --> 15:22.550
Oh God!

15:23.650 --> 15:24.250
Look at this!

15:41.758 --> 15:42.850
Look at this!

15:54.400 --> 15:56.433
This kind of looks like
your old girlfriend.

15:59.928 --> 16:03.950
Come on. Let's take this stuff upstairs.
I'll grab the recorder...

16:03.955 --> 16:05.650
...and you get everything else now.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.450
This guy was a real turd...
everybody hated him...

16:22.860 --> 16:24.750
Like...Like you, kind of.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.962
Yeah, just like me.
I'm gonna break your face.

16:27.877 --> 16:31.150
...also invented this western stuff
He makes all this little models...

16:31.250 --> 16:38.850
Ok, shush! Listen to this...
This is the tape I found downstairs.

16:40.350 --> 16:47.250
<i>It has been a number of years since I began excavating
the ruins of Candar with a group of my colleges.</i>

16:47.255 --> 16:52.950
<i>Now, my wife and I have retreated to a small cabin
in the solitude of these mountains.</i>

16:52.955 --> 16:56.520
<i>Here I continued my research
undisturbed by the myriad</i>

16:56.550 --> 17:01.350
<i>...distractions of modern civilization
and far from the groves of academe.</i>

17:01.950 --> 17:07.250
<i>I believe I have made a significant find
in the Candarian Ruins.</i>

17:07.255 --> 17:12.750
<i>A Volume of Ancient Sumarian burial practices
and funerary incantations.</i>

17:12.954 --> 17:15.950
<i>It is entitled "Naturon Demonto"</i>

17:15.954 --> 17:19.050
<i>...roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead".</i>

17:19.055 --> 17:21.349
<i>The book is bound in human flesh...</i>

17:21.355 --> 17:23.710
<i>...and inked in human blood.</i>

17:25.550 --> 17:29.750
<i>It deals with demons and
demon resurrection and those forces</i>

17:29.850 --> 17:33.950
<i>...which roam the forest and
dark bowers of man's domain.</i>

17:34.150 --> 17:37.750
<i>The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures may lie...</i>

17:37.850 --> 17:43.520
<i>...dormant but are never truly dead.
They may be recalled to active life</i>

17:43.550 --> 17:46.219
<i>...through the incantations
presented in this book.</i>

17:46.225 --> 17:49.050
<i>It is through recitation
of these passages...</i>

17:49.055 --> 17:52.750
<i>...that the demons are given license
to possess the living.</i>

17:54.750 --> 17:56.950
What did you do that for?
It was just getting good!

17:57.000 --> 17:59.308
I just don't want to hear it
anymore, that's all.

18:03.555 --> 18:05.750
Scotty, c'mon.
Leave her alone, man.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.976
Hey, come on...
I just want to hear the rest of it.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.273
No big deal.

18:11.170 --> 18:15.115
Tatre-ah-mis-trobeen-ha-zar-ta

18:15.415 --> 18:21.750
Tantir-man-ov-mansiz-onn-hazann-sobar.

18:21.940 --> 18:27.050
Sum-unda-rop-sa
Dar-his-hyk-err-duns-de-rod-sa

18:27.400 --> 18:29.051
Kanda!

18:30.650 --> 18:32.350
Shut it off!

18:33.108 --> 18:34.978
Kanda!

18:35.950 --> 18:37.597
Shut it off!!

18:37.650 --> 18:38.950
Kanda!

18:39.230 --> 18:41.750
Shut it off!!!

18:42.258 --> 18:43.551
Oh my God!

18:48.050 --> 18:51.050
Cheryl! Where're you going?

18:51.055 --> 18:51.750
I can't believe this!

18:51.755 --> 18:56.250
Scott, you knew not to play that!
I mean c'mon, you knew it was upsetting her.

18:56.255 --> 18:58.550
You just don't know when you're
taking something too far.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.850
Don't give me that!
You were playing it too.
You could've shut it off.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.650
I mean... big deal!

19:03.964 --> 19:05.666
She's nuts!

19:06.373 --> 19:08.720
I mean it's just a joke,
c'mon!

19:09.050 --> 19:12.820
Jesus Christ. She acts like she's
three years old or something.

19:26.650 --> 19:31.050
Listen. Why don't we stay up
for a while and listen to the storm?

19:31.150 --> 19:35.250
All right, yeah.
Let me check on Cheryl first to see if she's Ok.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.142
Stealing from the blind, eh?

20:46.650 --> 20:48.650
It's for you.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.550
Ash, how sweet of you.

21:05.850 --> 21:07.617
- Would you put it on?
- Oh, Sure.

21:10.450 --> 21:13.050
I was going to give it to you
before we came up here, but...

21:13.550 --> 21:19.350
...things got so hectic, this is really
the first chance we've had to be alone.

21:22.550 --> 21:23.750
Take a look.

21:27.350 --> 21:34.350
Oh, Ash! It's beautiful!
I really love it. I'll never take it off.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.750
<i>Join Us!</i>

23:10.860 --> 23:12.050
Is anybody out there?

24:14.389 --> 24:16.481
I know someone's out there!

24:22.710 --> 24:26.750
I heard you.
I heard you in the cellar.

25:03.628 --> 25:07.037
<i>Join Us!</i>

28:32.300 --> 28:33.600
Ashley!

29:08.535 --> 29:09.597
Help!

29:34.450 --> 29:38.105
What the hell happened to you? Cheryl, what's the matter with you?
Did something in the woods do this to you?

29:38.114 --> 29:44.500
No! It was the woods themselves! They're alive Ashley!
The trees! They're alive!

29:44.550 --> 29:47.000
Ash. Why don't I take her in the
back room so she can lie down...

29:47.008 --> 29:50.300
I'm not lying down!
I want to get out of here.

29:50.305 --> 29:53.800
I want to leave this place right now.
Right now, Ashley!

29:53.805 --> 29:54.800
Wait a minute!

29:54.850 --> 29:57.000
I sure as hell am not
leaving any place tonight.

29:57.050 --> 29:57.821
- Cheryl.
- Cheryl.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.400
Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
Trees do not attack people.

30:00.405 --> 30:03.600
Ashley! Will you drive me into town or not?

30:03.608 --> 30:09.100
Right now?! Look, sure, sure, I'll take you
into town, but just listen to what you're saying.

30:09.108 --> 30:13.300
I don't care how it sounds.
I wanna get out of this place right now!

30:14.300 --> 30:16.900
Ok, maybe you could stay
somewhere in town tonight.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.600
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.

32:25.150 --> 32:26.850
Why are you stopping?

32:28.550 --> 32:29.950
Wait here a minute.

32:40.950 --> 32:42.450
Do you see something?

32:46.150 --> 32:47.450
Where're you going?

32:51.550 --> 32:52.750
Ashley!

33:05.250 --> 33:06.450
Ashley!

34:08.250 --> 34:11.889
It's not going to let us go!
It's not going to let us go!

34:11.900 --> 34:18.150
I told you! I told you! It's not going to let us go!
Why won't you listen to me?

34:32.949 --> 34:37.949
<i>I know now that my wife has become
host to a Candarian demon.</i>

34:38.050 --> 34:41.350
<i>I fear that the only way to stop
those possessed by the...</i>

34:41.449 --> 34:45.250
<i>...spirits of the book is through the act
of...bodily dismemberment.</i>

34:45.350 --> 34:50.650
<i>I believe now to avoid this horror,
but for myself, I have seen the dark
shadows moving...</i>

34:50.750 --> 34:59.450
<i>...in the woods and I have no doubt
that whatever I have resurrected through
this book is sure to come calling...for me.</i>

34:59.750 --> 35:01.450
Ok, ah, let me think.  Ummm...

35:02.550 --> 35:03.350
It's a seven?

35:03.750 --> 35:04.950
Oh! What suit?

35:05.150 --> 35:08.150
Ahh... diamonds. No wait! Ummm, hearts!

35:08.158 --> 35:13.350
- Oh My! It's seven of hearts! You're right!
- Hey Ash! I guessed the card right!

35:13.355 --> 35:14.950
Yeah... truly amazing, Linda.

35:15.250 --> 35:18.350
I don't know, but I think it's really some
sort of extra sense or something...

35:18.397 --> 35:20.950
- ...you know, like ESP.
- Ok, try this one...

35:21.550 --> 35:22.550
Ok... It's a seven.

35:22.558 --> 35:24.750
- I don't believe it!
- ...of Spades.

35:24.950 --> 35:28.150
Queen of Spades.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.950
Four of Hearts.

35:33.350 --> 35:36.050
Eight of Spades.

35:36.058 --> 35:41.250
Two of Spades. Jack of Diamonds.
Jack of Clubs!

35:43.050 --> 35:47.238
Why have you disturbed our sleep?
Awakened us...

35:47.240 --> 35:54.864
...from our ancient slumber?
You will die! Like the others before you.

35:55.145 --> 35:58.850
One by one we will take you.

36:11.550 --> 36:12.950
What happened to her?

36:23.350 --> 36:28.650
Did you see her eyes? Oh Ash, I'm scared.
What's wrong with her?

37:19.450 --> 37:20.850
Cheryl! Stop it!

37:43.521 --> 37:46.222
- Oh, Shit!
- Join Us! Join...

39:18.950 --> 39:21.900
Ash. I think we ought to get out of here.

39:22.594 --> 39:23.751
Yeah.

39:25.350 --> 39:27.250
We still have a few more hours before morning.

39:27.258 --> 39:30.250
I don't think I can wait that long.

39:30.650 --> 39:33.450
You have to.
We all have to!

39:33.650 --> 39:40.050
And then in the morning, we'll get in
the car...and we'll take the bridge. And...

39:42.650 --> 39:45.575
Why does she keep making
those horrible noises?!

39:45.579 --> 39:47.001
I don't know!

39:47.023 --> 39:50.050
And what about her eyes?

39:51.580 --> 39:53.896
What about her eyes?

39:55.050 --> 40:00.250
For God's Sake,
What happened to her eyes?!

40:14.350 --> 40:15.750
Everything's going to be all right.

40:35.550 --> 40:38.650
Scotty. I think there's
something out there.

40:47.450 --> 40:51.050
Go to bed, and get some sleep. Ok?

42:40.750 --> 42:41.850
Shelly?

43:53.050 --> 44:00.650
Thank you, I don't know what I would have done
if I had remained on those hot coals...

44:01.234 --> 44:07.129
...burning my pretty flesh. You have
pretty skin.

44:07.602 --> 44:09.350
Give it to us!

44:24.287 --> 44:25.650
Join Us!

44:36.573 --> 44:37.750
Join Us!

47:11.750 --> 47:12.750
Hit her!

47:14.650 --> 47:15.650
Hit her!

47:17.050 --> 47:18.050
Hit it!

48:11.550 --> 48:12.650
Scott?

48:15.100 --> 48:16.100
Yeah?

48:17.250 --> 48:20.950
What is...
What are we going to do?

48:24.350 --> 48:25.950
We're going to bury her.

48:27.097 --> 48:29.450
You...can't bury Shelly.

48:29.529 --> 48:32.050
- She's a... she's a friend of ours, isn't she?
- Ash, she's dead.

48:34.950 --> 48:36.150
Shelly's dead.

48:40.050 --> 48:41.650
We gotta bury her now.

49:40.650 --> 49:45.312
- Linda's still sleeping. I think once her leg...
- I'm getting out of here.

49:45.450 --> 49:48.450
Scott, we can't take Linda
anywhere with a leg like that.

49:48.500 --> 49:51.500
We don't even know if there is
any other way back besides the bridge.

49:51.650 --> 49:56.150
Well, maybe there's a hiking trail, or an old
road or some other way around the cliff.

49:56.750 --> 50:00.350
I mean there's gotta be another
way besides the bridge.

50:00.450 --> 50:05.450
Listen to me. Linda cannot walk with
a leg like that. She can't even stand up.

50:06.050 --> 50:09.452
Well, then we'll leave her here.
Until we can send somebody back.

50:09.465 --> 50:13.158
- What are you, crazy?
- Look! I'm getting out!

50:13.650 --> 50:18.650
I don't care what happens to her.
She's your girlfriend, you take care of her.

50:18.658 --> 50:20.750
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Right now!

50:41.857 --> 50:44.840
Soon all of you will be like me.

50:44.850 --> 50:47.850
And then who will lock you up in the cellar?

51:40.572 --> 51:43.150
Ash! Ash!

51:43.158 --> 51:45.850
- Oh my God!
- Help me!

51:48.932 --> 51:50.620
Help me, Ash.

51:57.850 --> 52:03.850
Scotty. You're going to be Ok.
You're going to be just fine. You'll see.

52:15.150 --> 52:17.950
Ash. It's not going to let us leave.

52:18.350 --> 52:21.950
Cheryl...Cheryl was right.

52:22.958 --> 52:24.350
We're all going to die here!

52:24.400 --> 52:25.950
No, we're not going to die.

52:25.970 --> 52:28.450
We're all going to die.
All of us!

52:29.550 --> 52:34.250
No, we're not going to die! We're not
going to die! We're gonna get out of here.

52:34.550 --> 52:38.550
Now listen to me, Scotty.
Is there a way around the bridge?

52:40.250 --> 52:44.850
Scotty! Listen to me, please. For God's sake!
Scott!

52:46.950 --> 52:54.300
Ash...Ash, I don't wanna die. You're not going
to leave me are you, Ash? Are you?

52:54.310 --> 53:00.450
I don't wanna die. You're not going
to leave me here are you? Are you, Ash?

53:03.350 --> 53:09.150
Scotty! Now c'mon listen to me for God's sake!
Is there a way around the bridge?

53:09.200 --> 53:17.841
There's a way. The trail.
But the trees, Ash. They know.

53:19.050 --> 53:21.750
Don't you see, Ash? They're alive!

53:33.630 --> 53:34.400
Shut up!

53:34.450 --> 53:35.250
Shut up, Linda.

53:41.250 --> 53:42.250
Shut up!

53:58.250 --> 53:59.250
Kill her!

54:00.560 --> 54:01.560
Kill her!

54:01.562 --> 54:05.950
Kill her if you can, loverboy.

54:12.530 --> 54:14.270
God! Forgive me, Linda.

54:39.650 --> 54:42.950
Oh, Ash. Help me, please!

54:47.350 --> 54:52.750
Ash. Help me, please...Ash.

54:52.850 --> 54:56.150
Oh, Ash. Please, don't let them
take me away again.

54:56.810 --> 55:00.609
- Please.
- No, I won't. I won't. I promise.

55:01.250 --> 55:04.550
Ashley. Ashley, help me.

55:04.650 --> 55:06.250
Let me out of here.

55:07.150 --> 55:10.950
Ashley? Ash, help me.

55:10.962 --> 55:13.879
Let me out of here.
I'm... I'm all right now.

55:14.650 --> 55:18.384
I'm all right now, Ashley...
I'm all right.

55:20.377 --> 55:23.050
Unlock this chain and let me out.

55:30.450 --> 55:31.450
Cheryl?

56:05.250 --> 56:06.650
Cheryl?

56:13.150 --> 56:18.750
I'm all right now, Ashley!
Come unlock the chain and let me out!

56:19.600 --> 56:23.850
I'm all right now.
It's your sister Cheryl.

56:31.250 --> 56:32.750
You bastards!

56:32.770 --> 56:35.950
Why are you torturing me like this? Why?!

56:46.820 --> 56:47.820
Shut up!

56:47.850 --> 56:53.450
We're going to get you.
We're going to get you.

56:53.500 --> 56:59.132
Not another peep.
Time to go to sleep.

56:59.539 --> 57:00.339
We're...

57:09.073 --> 57:10.250
It's Useless!

57:10.500 --> 57:11.750
Useless!

57:12.030 --> 57:16.650
In time, it will come for him and
then it will come for you!

57:41.500 --> 57:44.573
Here. Here.

57:45.538 --> 57:50.750
Now, the sun will be up in an hour or so
and we can all get out of here together.

57:51.150 --> 57:54.850
You, me, Linda, Shelly.

57:56.230 --> 58:00.650
Hmm...Well...Shelly...she...

58:02.650 --> 58:04.550
We'll all be going home together.

58:05.650 --> 58:07.798
Wouldn't you like to be going home?

58:08.590 --> 58:11.050
I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

58:15.850 --> 58:16.950
Scott?

59:21.970 --> 59:22.970
Join Us!

59:23.630 --> 59:24.630
Join Us!

01:01:51.027 --> 01:01:52.247
Oh, Linda.

01:06:03.999 --> 01:06:06.378
Come to me.

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:16.747
The door.

01:08:39.444 --> 01:08:41.149
The back door.

01:08:49.111 --> 01:08:52.550
Shells.
Where did I see that box of shells?

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:36.100
<i>We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get you!</i>

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:37.452
Shut up, Linda.

01:10:37.864 --> 01:10:40.153
- We're all gonna die.
- Shut up.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.154
- All of us.
- Shut up!

01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:48.570
<i>- How sweet of you....God! Forgive me, Linda.
- ...is through the act of...bodily dismemberment.</i>

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:53.450
Hit her. Hit her.
Hit it!

01:14:41.623 --> 01:14:45.750
Oh, Come on. Come on.
Why are you torturing me like this?

01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:34.158
Linda.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.680

01:15:54.386 --> 01:15:55.886
