At this point, we must focus on the son.

There's no sign of him either, sir.

I want him found and framed to rule.

of course.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.799
His "My way or the highway."

01:46.560 --> 01:49.859
But I gotta hand it to Him,
He had a couple of great seconds

01:49.960 --> 01:51.860

And despite H/s pissiness
and His massive lack of irony

02:09.440 --> 02:12.147
He did give Mankind a good turn at bat

Kid can cause a tsunami with a hiccup.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.264
I don't know.
Maybe he's covering his tracks.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.740
Or this apparent dearth of evidence is,
in fact, the evidence.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.020

04:39.480 --> 04:41.823
Of some horrific misadventure

by Asmodeus.

being hijacked to Heaven by angels.

That's what I'm gonna find out.

about meeting,

05:06.840 --> 05:09.024
