- Should we shoot them?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.392

I wanna clear my name.
I wanna know who did this to me.

Theywere corporate guys,
uh, but-- but really scary.

07:12.298 --> 07:15.096
And the ladyon the phone--
she told me to break into there, okay...

07:15.168 --> 07:18.001
and get a memory dump
off their hard drive and get it back to her.

07:18.070 --> 07:21.506

-I said she was freaking insane.
I'm a computer tech, man.

I'm not a break-in guy.

- And this led to you being hog-tied on an airstrip.

The ladyon the phone threatened
myfamily, so we decided to bail.

and then we went upstate...

07:40.460 --> 07:42.394
they took my wife and my kid.

I gotta say, I didn't expectyou back.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.056

to be back either.

I didn't wanna scare Veronica,you know...

want me for a job. For now, that's all I got.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.152
- Ajob? Does itpay?
- More of a...

- "We'll kill you ifyou don't do it" type ofthing.
- Ah.

on my case, and I--

we could do worse.

- Did she giveyou a name, anything?
