17:25.639 --> 17:30.519
And The conductor
was a fucking god.

17:30.603 --> 17:32.271
Remember it took them a year,

17:32.355 --> 17:33.773
a full year to invent
the Nullies

17:33.856 --> 17:38.194

The Conductor reigned.

The Conductor would go out

-That stuff actually happened?

20:33.577 --> 20:34.119
Shall we?

20:34.203 --> 20:34.745
Uh.

20:34.828 --> 20:37.248
So how'd they get you?

20:37.331 --> 20:38.457
Was the driver.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.667
Ah!

20:39.750 --> 20:41.794
Um, first time, and uh,
someone tripped the alarm,

20:41.877 --> 20:42.920
and we didn't make it
six blocks.

20:43.003 --> 20:44.213
It's always that way, innit?

20:44.296 --> 20:46.423
Just one slip up is all it takes
and then you wind up in here

20:46.507 --> 20:47.800
with the most powerful people
on the planet

20:47.883 --> 20:49.593
where their powers
don't mean anything anymore.

20:49.677 --> 20:50.803
No?

20:50.886 --> 20:54.682
No, because the Nullies
screw up the pecking order.

20:54.765 --> 20:58.310
See, without a Nullie on,
I'd be able to fry a city block

20:58.394 --> 20:59.520
with just my fingertips.

20:59.603 --> 21:01.564
With the Nullie on,
I'm just a handsome old man.

21:01.647 --> 21:03.482
Whereas some of these guys,
some of these dudes

21:03.566 --> 21:05.234
still have like
their natural size,

21:05.317 --> 21:06.443
their natural strength.

21:06.527 --> 21:08.028
Darius, for example.

21:08.112 --> 21:10.281
I mean he may not have
a supernatural strength,

21:10.364 --> 21:13.701
but you wouldn't wanna pick
a fight with him.

21:13.784 --> 21:15.786
Or Diamond Jim.

21:15.869 --> 21:16.996
Or Payback.

21:17.079 --> 21:19.331
Or pretty much anyone
from the looks of you.

Respect. No, I-- you know,
I shouldn't have pried.

21:26.547 --> 21:28.382
That's my bad. You know,
we've got plenty of time

21:28.465 --> 21:29.717
to get to know each other.

21:29.800 --> 21:34.179
Right, um, so uh, has anyone
ever made a break for it?

21:34.263 --> 21:35.431
From here?

21:35.514 --> 21:36.390
Are you joking?

21:36.473 --> 21:37.558
No, no, no.

21:37.641 --> 21:40.352
This place is locked up tighter than a nun's ass.

21:40.436 --> 21:43.731
I'm speaking figuratively,
not from personal experience.

21:43.814 --> 21:47.693
Yeah, yeah,
um, so-- so real talk.

21:47.776 --> 21:49.028
Yeah.

21:49.111 --> 21:51.363
Uh, is it-- is it true?
Is he-- is he really here?

Who's really here?

21:54.158 --> 21:57.661
The Lobe.

21:57.745 --> 22:02.207
Yes, The Lobe is here.

22:02.291 --> 22:06.962
And if there is a higher power,
he's never getting out.

22:07.046 --> 22:07.880
No, I've heard the stories.

22:07.963 --> 22:08.547
What stories?

22:08.631 --> 22:09.465
Uh, uh, this one time,

22:09.548 --> 22:11.008
he used mind control
on this woman

22:11.091 --> 22:12.551
to make her murder
her entire family,

22:12.635 --> 22:13.886
including the baby.

22:13.969 --> 22:16.639
And then there's another one where he-- he used telekinesis

22:16.722 --> 22:18.932
on this guy to pull his brain right out of the skull

22:19.016 --> 22:19.475
through his nose.

22:19.558 --> 22:21.268
Yes. Listen to me.

22:21.352 --> 22:24.229
The last person,
I mean the last person

22:24.313 --> 22:28.317
that you wanna mess
with in here is The Lobe,

22:28.400 --> 22:34.406
because without a Nullie,
he's unstoppable.

22:35.491 --> 22:36.784
Do you understand?

22:36.867 --> 22:38.410
I mean they've taken
extra security precautions

22:38.494 --> 22:42.956
but uh, um, I don't even like talking about him, so--

22:43.040 --> 22:44.041
-Uh.
-I'm gonna go.

22:44.124 --> 22:45.459
Thank you.

22:45.542 --> 22:48.796
You need anything kid,
just holler.

22:48.879 --> 22:49.546
Uh.

22:49.630 --> 22:51.924
See you around.

22:52.007 --> 22:52.716
O-- okay.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.884
I wouldn't stand there.

22:56.679 --> 22:57.763
Hey, Gordon.

22:57.846 --> 22:59.139
Hey, hey, Gordon!

23:00.516 --> 23:02.184
What? What's up?

23:02.267 --> 23:03.686
It's time.

23:06.021 --> 23:06.563
Time it is.

23:07.398 --> 23:16.407
[♪♪♪]

23:22.413 --> 23:31.422
[♪♪♪]

23:37.428 --> 23:46.437
[♪♪♪]

23:57.573 --> 24:00.075
BOARD LEADER:
Julius Loeb, aka The Lobe.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.080
Good morning.

24:05.164 --> 24:06.832
BOARD LEADER:
This is the fourth time
you've been summoned

24:06.915 --> 24:09.126
in front of this court
to discuss your parole.

24:09.209 --> 24:11.128
When I get to five,
do I get a toaster?

24:11.211 --> 24:14.757
BOARD LEADER:
Mr. Loeb, this parole hearing
is required to determine a--

24:14.840 --> 24:15.716
Oh, fuck off.

24:15.799 --> 24:16.842
BOARD LEADER:
What?

24:16.925 --> 24:19.762
No, Mr. Loeb, I will not have you make a mockery

24:19.845 --> 24:20.637
out of this hearing.

24:20.721 --> 24:25.768
You don't like me,
you kiss my ass.

24:25.851 --> 24:27.519
Problem solved.

24:28.645 --> 24:32.441
BOARD LEADER:
Julius Loeb, you are not ready
to re-enter society.

24:32.524 --> 24:34.026
I'll get over it.

24:34.109 --> 24:39.531
BOARD LEADER:
Schedule another psychological
evaluation. Parole denied.

24:43.202 --> 24:47.956
Surprise, surprise, surprise,
motherfucker.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.042
How you doin', warden?

24:50.125 --> 24:52.419
It's Overseer to you.

24:52.503 --> 24:54.421
And you can shove it
with your Looney Tunes act.

24:54.505 --> 24:55.964
We're alone now, okay?

24:56.048 --> 24:57.549
How romantic.

24:57.633 --> 25:00.344
Frost almost found out
about our cage fights.

25:00.427 --> 25:02.888
And without the betting,
my bank account is a bit

25:02.971 --> 25:04.890
behind the eight-ball,
if you know what I mean?

25:04.973 --> 25:06.350
What? No nest egg?

25:06.433 --> 25:08.310
No, no, no,
you're gonna get me rich

25:08.393 --> 25:10.187
before my retirement.

25:10.270 --> 25:12.815
You can mind control people
and move shit with your mind,

25:12.898 --> 25:15.818
but in here,
you're just another felon.

25:15.901 --> 25:18.779
You're in prison for life.

25:18.862 --> 25:22.366
Now you're gonna give me
your fortune, every single cent.

25:22.449 --> 25:23.450
Or?

25:23.534 --> 25:26.453
Or you fuck with me
and you see what happens.

25:26.537 --> 25:28.121
So this is a stick-up?

25:28.205 --> 25:31.875
Bingo. I will fuck up that mind
if yours so good.

25:31.959 --> 25:34.336
Psychedelics
or a fuckin' screwdriver,

25:34.419 --> 25:36.255
doesn't matter to me.

25:36.338 --> 25:37.589
It's your choice.

25:37.673 --> 25:38.841
Now, let me get this straight.

25:38.924 --> 25:41.969
I give you billions
or you give me a lobotomy.

25:42.052 --> 25:43.470
There ya go.

25:43.554 --> 25:45.514
[Chuckling]

25:45.597 --> 25:47.140
That's my genius.

25:47.224 --> 25:50.894
Fine, but I'm gonna need
a few things first.

25:50.978 --> 25:52.938
Oh, goddammit!

25:53.021 --> 25:56.316
I can't let that slippery fish get away.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.609
He is in prison.

25:57.693 --> 26:00.737
No, I'm talkin' metaphorically,
damn it!

26:00.821 --> 26:02.823
Come on, what do you want
from me anyway?

26:02.906 --> 26:04.992
It's not like I got forever.
I mean do I?

26:05.075 --> 26:06.702
What? I got like what uh...

26:06.785 --> 26:10.247
One month, two weeks, four days.

26:10.330 --> 26:14.543
Didn't know you were countin'.
You're gonna miss me, ain't you?

26:14.626 --> 26:17.045
[Chuckling]

26:20.132 --> 26:21.508
[Groaning]

26:21.592 --> 26:23.552
Good afternoon.

26:28.390 --> 26:29.808
You're still unconscious.

26:29.892 --> 26:30.517
Okay.

26:33.812 --> 26:35.522
[Chuckling]

26:35.606 --> 26:37.691
How's it goin', Officer Morales?

26:37.774 --> 26:39.985
No complaints, Doctor Josephs.

26:40.068 --> 26:41.528
[Sighs]

26:41.612 --> 26:46.158
It's funny. I was gonna say
the exact opposite.

26:47.659 --> 26:50.829
Hi. Uh, here for trash.

26:50.913 --> 26:54.249
Sure. Yeah, um, y-- you can just start right in there.

26:54.333 --> 26:55.334
Thank you.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.127
Is there a problem, convict?

26:57.210 --> 26:58.670
No, ma'am.

27:04.718 --> 27:06.970
What? He looked at me.

27:07.054 --> 27:08.138
I'm pretty sure
that's not a crime.

27:08.221 --> 27:09.514
CAPTAIN JASON:
Morales.

27:09.598 --> 27:10.974
Yes, Captain.

27:11.058 --> 27:12.392
CAPTAIN JASON:
Need eyes on B deck
for a shakedown tour.

27:12.476 --> 27:14.645
I think the Flu
is makin' Pruno again.

27:14.728 --> 27:16.021
[Sighs]

27:16.104 --> 27:18.190
On my way down.

27:19.650 --> 27:21.777
Watch yourself, fish.

27:21.860 --> 27:23.528
Don't even think about it.

27:24.279 --> 27:25.322
Yes, ma'am.

27:33.246 --> 27:35.207
Hey.

27:35.290 --> 27:36.792
Hey, newbie.

27:36.875 --> 27:38.502
I uh...

27:38.585 --> 27:40.212
[Chuckles]

27:40.295 --> 27:44.675
I get why she has to be like
that, but I am not like that.

27:45.717 --> 27:46.885
No?

27:46.969 --> 27:49.805
Believe it or not, not everybody here is out to get you.

27:51.181 --> 27:52.891
It's okay, you--
you can talk to me.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.059
You won't get in trouble.

27:54.142 --> 27:58.021
Well, I'm Isabelle
or Dr. Josephs

27:58.105 --> 27:59.815
if you need a doctor.

27:59.898 --> 28:01.066
Diego.

28:01.149 --> 28:02.150
It's nice to meet you.

28:02.234 --> 28:03.568
Don't let Morales get to you.

28:05.445 --> 28:06.863
She doesn't like anybody.

28:08.407 --> 28:09.825
So what about you?

28:09.908 --> 28:11.326
I-- I love bein' around people

28:11.410 --> 28:14.746
and uh, somehow can't get enough
of this place.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.374
So what happened to him?

28:17.457 --> 28:18.458
How'd he die there?

28:18.542 --> 28:21.128
Oh, uh, Bernie's actually
not dead.

28:21.211 --> 28:24.256
He is regeneratin'
and I'm studyin' him.

28:24.339 --> 28:25.757
He can survive without his head?

28:25.841 --> 28:26.842
Yeah.

28:26.925 --> 28:28.135
Well, without his power-nullifyin' equipment,

28:28.218 --> 28:31.179
I think that he'll be--
he'll have a head

28:31.263 --> 28:33.682
within about a week and a half.

28:33.765 --> 28:35.100
That's incredible.

28:35.183 --> 28:37.019
He's actually a real sweetie.

28:37.102 --> 28:39.730
I-- I should probably leave.

28:39.813 --> 28:40.439
Oh yeah.

28:40.522 --> 28:41.356
No, of course,
I don't--

28:41.440 --> 28:42.274
Keep playing.

28:42.357 --> 28:44.526
I don't wanna get you
in trouble.

28:47.612 --> 28:49.906
It's really nice
to meet you though, Diego.

28:49.990 --> 28:50.615
Yeah, you, too.

28:51.408 --> 28:52.367
He's here.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.578
Excuse me.

28:57.664 --> 28:59.082
OFFICER LIZ:
Dr. Josephs.

29:00.542 --> 29:01.877
Stay alert.

29:11.094 --> 29:12.179
All righty.

29:14.890 --> 29:17.017
It's been a full year
since your last checkup.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.268
Yes.

29:18.351 --> 29:21.396
Overseer finally easin' up
on you a bit?

29:21.480 --> 29:23.398
Yeah, somethin' like that.

29:23.482 --> 29:24.524
DR. ISABELLE:
Any headaches lately?

29:24.608 --> 29:25.776
THE LOBE:
Some.

29:25.859 --> 29:27.027
Not too bad.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.780
This is pretty normal
with all the power-suppressants

29:29.863 --> 29:31.698
they put in the food here.

29:31.782 --> 29:34.534
I assume you've heard that Overseer Devlin is retirin'?

29:35.077 --> 29:36.912
He might have mentioned it.

29:36.995 --> 29:38.288
Actually, maybe they'll promote
from within.

29:38.371 --> 29:40.916
That way the new warden
would have some idea of--

29:40.999 --> 29:42.292
[Chuckles]

29:42.375 --> 29:44.669
How the system works
and how to run a prison.

29:44.753 --> 29:47.255
San Tib will definitely
have a different feeling

29:47.339 --> 29:48.882
without him here,
don't you think?

29:48.965 --> 29:50.801
Yes.

29:50.884 --> 29:53.011
How'd your parole hearing go?

29:53.095 --> 29:54.638
Same as always.

29:54.721 --> 29:56.431
If you keep mouthin' off
at them,

29:56.515 --> 29:58.308
they're never gonna let you go.

29:58.391 --> 29:59.601
C'est la vie.

30:02.813 --> 30:03.688
PAYBACK:
Hey, doc.

30:03.772 --> 30:06.149
[Grunting]

30:09.069 --> 30:10.487
Enjoy your nap.

30:10.570 --> 30:13.115
[Taking deep breaths]

30:13.198 --> 30:15.200
Nice cross.

30:15.283 --> 30:16.618
I know who you are.

30:16.701 --> 30:18.870
Do you know
how to make holy water?

30:18.954 --> 30:20.831
You boil the hell out of it.

30:20.914 --> 30:24.000
The billions you stole,
the lives you destroyed...

30:24.084 --> 30:25.085
Very tasty.

30:25.168 --> 30:27.879
[Taking deep breaths]

30:31.550 --> 30:34.970
I am the alpha and the omega,

30:35.053 --> 30:41.309
who is, and who was,
and who is coming.

30:41.393 --> 30:42.769
Okay.

30:42.853 --> 30:45.105
Now let's see what's inside
that head of yours.

30:45.188 --> 30:46.189
Hey, leave him alone!

30:46.273 --> 30:47.149
You--

30:47.232 --> 30:49.025
[Grunting]

30:49.109 --> 30:50.110
PAYBACK:
Get off me!

30:50.193 --> 30:53.029
[Payback and Diego grunting]

30:53.113 --> 30:54.197
[Coughs]

30:54.281 --> 30:55.991
[Grunting]

30:56.074 --> 30:57.075
I'm gonna kill you!

30:57.159 --> 31:00.871
[Grunting]

31:00.954 --> 31:03.290
Get off me!

31:03.373 --> 31:10.130
GUARD 1:
Come on.

31:13.341 --> 31:17.053
Way to go, slugger!

31:17.137 --> 31:17.846
[Chuckles]

31:17.929 --> 31:19.389
Thanks, I didn't do anything.

31:19.472 --> 31:23.602
Oh! Others might beg to differ.

31:23.685 --> 31:24.895
How'd it feel?

31:27.189 --> 31:31.985
How'd it feel givin' Payback
a little payback?

31:32.068 --> 31:33.653
Everybody's talkin' about it.

31:33.737 --> 31:34.738
Thanks.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.656
Just sayin'.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.241
Well done.

31:38.325 --> 31:38.867
-It's--
-Well done.

31:38.950 --> 31:39.492
[Chuckling]

31:39.576 --> 31:40.952
Not like I planned it.

31:41.036 --> 31:42.037
Oh, no, no, no.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.288
Perish the thought,
perish the thought,

31:43.371 --> 31:49.878
but uh, The Lobe and his ilk

31:51.755 --> 31:54.549
are still very appreciative
of that around here.

31:55.926 --> 31:57.469
Around here appreciation
goes a long way.

31:57.552 --> 31:58.553
You gonna eat that?

31:58.637 --> 31:59.638
[Chuckles]

31:59.721 --> 32:02.140
No uh, call it thanks
for showing me around.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.351
I have space.

32:04.434 --> 32:06.478
Diego Diaz.

32:06.561 --> 32:07.646
My man.

32:07.729 --> 32:10.232
How long do you think
this is gonna go on for?

32:10.315 --> 32:13.860
Between uh, the Payback's
anti-fan club,

32:13.944 --> 32:18.031
which is um, everybody,
and uh, those of us

32:18.114 --> 32:19.449
who appreciate
the lovely Dr. Isabelle,

32:19.532 --> 32:24.663
which is um, everybody,
this could go on for some time.

32:25.455 --> 32:26.831
Good.

32:26.915 --> 32:28.291
Relax.

32:28.375 --> 32:30.335
Ooh, the good stuff, huh?

32:30.418 --> 32:31.670
Savor the flavor.

32:31.753 --> 32:33.004
Yeah, you say that.

32:33.088 --> 32:35.590
But then you-- then you also say that uh, mind my own business,

32:35.674 --> 32:38.343
-keep my--
-Kid...

32:40.887 --> 32:41.805
...listen to me.

32:44.015 --> 32:49.646
Nobody is ever gonna call you "fish" again.

32:49.729 --> 32:51.231
You understand me?

32:51.314 --> 32:56.069
As far as all these guys here
are concerned, you did good.

32:56.152 --> 32:57.362
You did good, kid.

32:57.445 --> 32:59.364
So, all I gotta do now
is heed my counsel.

32:59.447 --> 33:00.031
[Chuckles]

33:00.115 --> 33:00.865
Your counsel?

33:00.949 --> 33:01.825

the dampener power supply

1:01:58.727 --> 1:02:01.896
was retrofitted
with the wrong amperage.

1:02:01.980 --> 1:02:04.441
Okay. I'll call tech.
We'll get it handled.

1:02:04.524 --> 1:02:08.069
No, I can fix this.

It's a boys' club.

on his own merits?

1:02:44.939 --> 1:02:46.357
He's an idiot.
