00:23.952 --> 00:25.485
Hey, it's Marty.

00:25.487 --> 00:26.986
Gone surfing.

00:26.988 --> 00:28.071
Leave a message.

00:30.909 --> 00:32.075
Hello.

00:32.077 --> 00:34.077
Marty, it's Jenny.

00:34.079 --> 00:35.194
Jenny?

00:35.196 --> 00:37.296
Jenny Radler-- I need help.

00:37.298 --> 00:40.366
Jenny, it's 3:00 in the morning.

00:40.368 --> 00:42.001
I found something big.

00:42.003 --> 00:44.337
I'm guessing it's not sobriety.

00:44.339 --> 00:45.538
I'm in trouble.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.223
Okay, what's going on?

00:47.225 --> 00:49.759
They're stealing luxury SUVs,
shipping them to Asia.

00:49.761 --> 00:51.477
One blew up the police station
in Jakarta.

00:51.479 --> 00:53.146
There was a kidnapping
in Kuala Lumpur,

00:53.148 --> 00:55.214
a-a drive-by in Manila.

00:55.216 --> 00:57.266
The cars are from the Westside,
and then they go to Long Beach,

00:57.268 --> 00:59.435
<i>and get put on...</i>
<i>Oh, man, is that them?</i>

00:59.437 --> 01:00.603
<i>I thought I lost them.</i>

01:00.605 --> 01:02.438
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>You lost who?</i>

01:02.440 --> 01:04.941
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

01:06.326 --> 01:07.893
They're trying to kill me.
Oh, God, Marty.

01:07.895 --> 01:09.395
Oh, God.
Jenny, where are you?

01:09.397 --> 01:11.581
Jenny.
Oh, my God.

01:11.583 --> 01:13.366
Marty!

01:13.368 --> 01:15.201
Jenny, you got to talk to me.
Pick up your phone.

01:15.203 --> 01:17.253
<i>Marty, no, no!</i>

01:19.373 --> 01:22.008
Jenny.

01:46.116 --> 01:47.266
Good morning.

01:47.268 --> 01:48.367
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.736
Does anybody want coffee?

01:49.738 --> 01:50.737
I'm good.

01:50.739 --> 01:51.738
My New Year's resolution--

01:51.740 --> 01:53.156
I'm off caffeine.

01:53.158 --> 01:54.457
Never felt better.

01:54.459 --> 01:55.441
Awesome-- I've made it

01:55.443 --> 01:56.793
a week without refined sugar.

01:56.795 --> 01:58.795
- So pathetic.
- Wait a second.

01:58.797 --> 02:02.515
Did I just hear
Sam "My Body Is a Temple" Hanna

02:02.517 --> 02:03.599
give us
a hard time

02:03.601 --> 02:05.084
about being healthy?
Every year,

02:05.086 --> 02:07.637
people say the same thing--
"I'm gonna lose weight,

02:07.639 --> 02:09.889
"I'm gonna quit smoking,
I'm gonna spend more time

02:09.890 --> 02:13.092
with my family"-- and 92%
of them fail before February.

02:13.094 --> 02:14.777
Why even bother?
Wow.

02:14.779 --> 02:16.028
You know,
my second resolution

02:16.030 --> 02:18.430
was to not be
judgmental of others.

02:18.432 --> 02:20.149
I wasn't being judgmental; I was
quoting scientific studies.

02:20.151 --> 02:21.367
Well, scientifically,

02:21.369 --> 02:22.652
we could be part
of the eight percent

02:22.654 --> 02:24.270
who actually do succeed.

02:24.272 --> 02:25.238
The few, the proud.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.239
Hmm.

02:26.241 --> 02:27.907
Where's Deeks?
Oh, I know.

02:27.909 --> 02:29.459
His New Year's
resolution

02:29.461 --> 02:30.877
was to get to
work on time.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.212
Let's go.

02:33.214 --> 02:34.914
I've been here for hours.

02:34.916 --> 02:38.284
One blew up the police station
<i>in Jakarta.</i>

02:38.286 --> 02:40.419
There was a kidnapping
in Kuala Lumpur,

02:40.421 --> 02:42.288
a-a drive-by in Manila.

02:44.092 --> 02:46.175
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

02:48.263 --> 02:50.596
Jenny, where are you?

02:50.598 --> 02:52.265
Oh, my God.

02:52.267 --> 02:53.900
Marty!

02:53.902 --> 02:56.135
Jenny, you got to talk to me.
Pick up your phone.

02:56.137 --> 02:58.104
Marty, no, no!

02:58.106 --> 02:59.188
But there's more.

02:59.190 --> 03:00.439
Nell, play the tape.

03:02.142 --> 03:04.744
This is what we pulled
from a nearby traffic cam.

03:04.746 --> 03:05.978
And right after the crash,

03:05.980 --> 03:07.313
she was abducted
by these two guys.

03:07.315 --> 03:08.647
I take it the victim

03:08.649 --> 03:09.982
is a friend of yours?

03:09.984 --> 03:11.951
Jenny Radler.
Back in the day,

03:11.953 --> 03:14.437
I was her public defender
for a few misdemeanors--

03:14.439 --> 03:16.255
uh, shoplifting,
cocaine possession.

03:16.257 --> 03:18.424
You keep in touch
with all your former clients?

03:18.426 --> 03:20.426
No, she's not exactly
on my Christmas card list

03:20.428 --> 03:23.045
if that's what you're asking,
but when I made detective,

03:23.047 --> 03:25.181
she tried to be an informant,
and I emphasize "tried"

03:25.183 --> 03:26.265
because the most
she ever got

03:26.267 --> 03:28.301
was 20 bucks for ratting out
a tagger.

03:28.303 --> 03:29.602
Sounds like LAPD can handle it.

03:29.604 --> 03:31.137
Though her descriptions
of Southeast Asian

03:31.139 --> 03:32.939
acts of terrorism
were spot-on.

03:32.941 --> 03:34.173
Couldn't she have just

03:34.175 --> 03:35.892
found that out on the Internet?

03:35.894 --> 03:37.176
Not without the highest

03:37.178 --> 03:39.779
SCI clearance.

03:39.781 --> 03:42.031
Mr. Deeks and I enjoyed
the sunrise this morning.

03:42.033 --> 03:43.449
It was glorious.

03:43.451 --> 03:45.017
Mr. Beale.

03:45.019 --> 03:47.620
Stolen SUVs are making
their way across the Pacific

03:47.622 --> 03:49.822
for use as
paramilitary vehicles.

03:49.824 --> 03:52.241
They're behind
numerous civilian deaths.

03:52.243 --> 03:53.659
One day,

03:53.661 --> 03:55.861
it's a soccer mom's SUV
in Beverly Hills.

03:55.863 --> 03:57.380
Two weeks later,

03:57.382 --> 04:00.299
it blows up a government
building in the Philippines.

04:00.301 --> 04:03.535
This informant may hold
the key to dismantling

04:03.537 --> 04:05.721
an international terror ring.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.090
Could be the reason
she was kidnapped.

04:08.092 --> 04:10.092
Are you tracking
her cell phone?

04:10.094 --> 04:11.710
It's been off since the crash.

04:11.712 --> 04:13.679
Ooh, I just found
something.

04:13.681 --> 04:14.897
Her daughter Talia

04:14.899 --> 04:17.315
is a sophomore at
Whitley University.

04:17.317 --> 04:18.401
Are you kidding me?

04:18.403 --> 04:19.819
What?
Nothing.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.720
Just the last time
I saw her, she was just

04:21.721 --> 04:24.757
a little kid running
around a homeless shelter.

04:24.759 --> 04:26.659
Time flies.

04:26.661 --> 04:28.578
Why don't you two
check out the college?

04:28.580 --> 04:30.830
We'll look into
the minivan.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.245
Find anything?

04:46.247 --> 04:48.714
No drugs, no alcohol,
no weapons.

04:48.716 --> 04:50.582
- We're kind of done here.
- Except for the driver.

04:50.584 --> 04:52.935
Jenny Radler is a homeless
drug addict on parole.

04:52.937 --> 04:56.472
Looks like she crashed
and fled the scene.

04:56.474 --> 04:57.773
Where you looking for her?

04:57.775 --> 04:59.525
We have a warrant out.

04:59.527 --> 05:02.028
When she shows up,
she's going back to lockup.

05:02.030 --> 05:04.780
Mind if we take a look?
Knock yourself out.

05:14.825 --> 05:16.409
Definitely overdue
for maid service.

05:16.411 --> 05:17.460
Mm-hmm.

05:17.462 --> 05:19.412
Trip to the Laundromat.

05:19.414 --> 05:21.797
How do you live like this?

05:23.583 --> 05:25.584
Kung pao chicken.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.136
Judging from the lack of mold,

05:27.138 --> 05:29.505
I'd say
it's last night's dinner.

05:31.592 --> 05:32.892
Double-shot espresso, G.,

05:32.894 --> 05:34.760
sealed and untouched.

05:34.762 --> 05:37.263
You must be ready
for a little pick-me-up.

05:39.016 --> 05:43.802
2013 Range Rover HSE,
Lexus LX 570,

05:43.804 --> 05:45.321
Cadillac Escalade ESV.

05:45.323 --> 05:46.638
It's a little
beyond her means.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.940
Oh, interest rates
are low.

05:47.942 --> 05:50.026
There are some
attractive leases out there.

05:50.028 --> 05:52.278
Could be
a stolen car wish list.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.115
Something under the gas pedal.

05:56.117 --> 05:57.917
It's all over the floor mat.

06:02.039 --> 06:04.874
Looks like a USB thumb drive.

06:04.876 --> 06:06.792
A very dead USB thumb drive.

06:06.794 --> 06:08.461
Bag that for Eric.

06:08.463 --> 06:10.346
Let's hope the boy wonder
can bring it back to life.

06:10.348 --> 06:13.332
You mind if I take
the lead on this?

06:13.334 --> 06:15.384
Be my guest.
I helped Jenny retain custody

06:15.386 --> 06:17.803
when Child Protective Services
was trying to take Talia away,

06:17.805 --> 06:19.671
so we have a little bit
of a history together.

06:19.673 --> 06:20.839
She might feel
more comfortable

06:20.841 --> 06:22.558
with a sympathetic female.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.511
I don't know, I'm pretty
in touch with my feminine side.

06:25.513 --> 06:27.029
Yeah, see, that's the problem.

06:27.031 --> 06:29.014
If you did have
a feminine side,

06:29.016 --> 06:30.649
you'd be touching
it all the time.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.650
Wow.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.186
And yet, so true.

06:34.188 --> 06:35.454
Kens, there she is.

06:35.456 --> 06:37.473
Talia, hey.

06:37.475 --> 06:39.742
Hi.

06:39.744 --> 06:41.660
I'm, uh, Marty Deeks.
I'm sorry.

06:41.662 --> 06:44.029
I knew you when you were
just a... a little girl.

06:44.031 --> 06:46.698
I, um... I was
helping with, uh...

06:46.700 --> 06:48.300
I don't remember you.

06:48.302 --> 06:50.086
Uh, you and your mother
were living at the shelter.

06:50.088 --> 06:51.137
I was a... a lawyer...

06:51.139 --> 06:52.204
What's your name again?

06:52.206 --> 06:53.973
Marty Deeks.

06:53.975 --> 06:55.474
That's okay,
I'll just start

06:55.476 --> 06:57.226
from the top.

06:57.228 --> 06:58.477
Detective Marty Deeks, LAPD.

06:58.479 --> 06:59.711
This is
Special Agent Kensi Blye.

06:59.713 --> 07:01.480
Can we talk to
you for a sec?

07:01.482 --> 07:04.316
It's about your mother.

07:04.318 --> 07:06.218
Is my mom back in jail?

07:06.220 --> 07:08.671
No.
But we think she's in trouble.

07:08.673 --> 07:10.573
She's always in trouble.

07:10.575 --> 07:13.075
This is true, but we really
need your help on this.

07:13.077 --> 07:14.393
Yeah, and I could have
used her help

07:14.395 --> 07:15.911
for the first 18 years
of my life.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.831
You ever pee
in the back of a minivan,

07:18.833 --> 07:21.500
take a bath in the
sink at a diner?

07:21.502 --> 07:23.335
How about
fighting off

07:23.337 --> 07:25.070
perverts at a homeless shelter?

07:27.507 --> 07:29.458
That sounds horrible.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.878
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.515
When's the last time
you talked to your mom?

07:36.517 --> 07:40.269
Tuesday, December 21, 2010.

07:40.271 --> 07:42.021
It was my birthday.

07:42.023 --> 07:43.389
Look, I can't miss class.

07:43.391 --> 07:44.940
Okay, I get it, all right,

07:44.942 --> 07:46.925
but this is your mom
and she may have been kidnapped.

07:46.927 --> 07:50.813
Every day, I wake up
totally prepared

07:50.815 --> 07:52.865
to hear that she's dead.

07:52.867 --> 07:55.601
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

07:58.155 --> 08:01.040
Well done, counselor.

08:01.042 --> 08:03.459
I thought that went well.

08:13.207 --> 08:15.475
Nothing-- crystal
oscillator's shot.

08:15.477 --> 08:16.893
We're not giving up.

08:16.895 --> 08:17.927
300 millivolts?

08:17.929 --> 08:19.562
I guess.

08:27.422 --> 08:29.455
I'm calling it.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.674
Any luck with the recovery?

08:32.677 --> 08:34.010
Anything?

08:34.011 --> 08:36.395
The trauma
was extensive.

08:36.397 --> 08:40.099
The mass storage controller
was pulverized.

08:40.101 --> 08:41.851
We used all our
capabilities.

08:41.852 --> 08:45.187
But the damages
are beyond repair.

08:45.189 --> 08:48.391
Time of death: 10:45.

08:48.393 --> 08:51.694
Anything from Kensi and Deeks?

08:51.696 --> 08:53.596
Mother and daughter
are estranged.

08:53.598 --> 08:54.763
We're back to
square one.

08:54.765 --> 08:56.365
Not quite.

08:56.367 --> 08:58.117
Even though the getaway car
had no plates,

08:58.119 --> 09:00.236
there was
a torn-off bumper sticker.

09:00.238 --> 09:01.821
Based on the coloring
and a couple

09:01.823 --> 09:04.290
of partial letters,
we got a match.

09:04.292 --> 09:07.877
"My child is an honor student
at McCadden Elementary."

09:07.879 --> 09:09.962
We crossed school records
with recent

09:09.964 --> 09:11.614
motor vehicle thefts
and got you an address.

09:11.616 --> 09:13.749
Good. Kensi and Deeks
are in the neighborhood.

09:13.751 --> 09:16.619
What do we have
on stolen car rings?

09:16.621 --> 09:18.170
Over a hundred

09:18.172 --> 09:21.023
to choose from.

09:22.459 --> 09:26.145
Now, who do we know that can
tell us about stolen cars?

09:28.733 --> 09:30.132
I didn't do anything.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.400
We didn't say
you did anything.

09:31.402 --> 09:33.269
We just want to
talk to you, Jaime.

09:33.271 --> 09:35.438
I did six months at County, man.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.657
I'm on parole, homes,
staying straight.

09:37.659 --> 09:39.492
Yeah, then, why are
you running away?

09:39.494 --> 09:41.143
'Cause you guys are the cops.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.496
We're not cops; we're
federal agents, Jaime.

09:43.498 --> 09:44.797
Same difference.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.832
Thought you said
we were cool.

09:46.834 --> 09:48.134
You weren't chasing me then.

09:48.136 --> 09:49.535
We're not
chasing you now.

09:49.537 --> 09:51.704
We just want
to talk.

09:55.042 --> 09:57.043
Jaime, Jaime, Jaime.

09:57.045 --> 09:59.211
Want some water?

10:03.767 --> 10:06.085
Boy, oh, boy, this year
is just flying by, huh?

10:06.087 --> 10:07.470
It's January 8.

10:07.472 --> 10:10.690
Special day-- <i>ocho de enero,</i>
January 8.

10:10.692 --> 10:12.975
Just like you blink and...
eight days are gone.

10:12.977 --> 10:14.110
Wow,

10:14.112 --> 10:15.344
what are these,
two-acre lots?

10:15.346 --> 10:16.696
Yeah, the next time
we go undercover

10:16.698 --> 10:18.147
as a married couple, this

10:18.149 --> 10:20.182
is going to be our neighborhood.
I would get lost

10:20.184 --> 10:21.850
in such a big house.
Well, you need room

10:21.852 --> 10:22.851
for five kids,

10:22.853 --> 10:23.953
couple of dogs,
cat, hamster.

10:23.955 --> 10:25.154
Ha, five kids.

10:25.156 --> 10:26.288
You want to drive
your wife crazy?

10:26.290 --> 10:27.406
It won't be so bad.

10:27.408 --> 10:29.291
Have a Swedish au pair,
French maid.

10:29.293 --> 10:31.544
Huge alimony.

10:31.546 --> 10:34.747
<i>Buenos días.</i>
<i>Buenos días.</i>

10:34.749 --> 10:37.366
Mrs. Hall?
Hello.

10:37.368 --> 10:40.419
Special Agent Blye.
This is Detective Deeks.

10:40.421 --> 10:42.037
The police were here last week.

10:42.039 --> 10:44.056
I already did a report,
so I'm not quite sure

10:44.058 --> 10:45.374
why you're here.
Well, we're actually

10:45.376 --> 10:47.176
part of a special task force.

10:47.178 --> 10:49.311
Your car was used
in a major crime last night.

10:49.313 --> 10:51.764
Do you know exactly
when it was stolen?

10:51.766 --> 10:54.233
Friday, at 2:00 in the morning.

10:55.435 --> 10:56.519
Did your security cameras

10:56.521 --> 10:58.437
pick up anything?

10:58.439 --> 11:00.489
A guy opened the door
and drove away.

11:00.491 --> 11:01.524
Couldn't see his face.

11:01.526 --> 11:02.891
So, the

11:02.893 --> 11:04.410
keys were inside the car?

11:04.412 --> 11:06.495
No. We had
a break-in

11:06.497 --> 11:07.997
a coup weelego.

11:07.999 --> 11:09.832
All they got was some jewelry
from the bedroom.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.668
We didn't realize they
stole a spare car key

11:12.670 --> 11:14.453
from the kitchen.
Well, we'd still like to review

11:14.455 --> 11:16.222
your security video,
if that's okay.

11:16.224 --> 11:17.673
The detectives went over it
frame by frame.

11:17.675 --> 11:18.624
You can't see anything.

11:18.626 --> 11:20.259
It would really
help us out a lot.

11:20.261 --> 11:22.795
- Uh, does it have to be right now?
- Yes.

11:22.797 --> 11:24.513
A woman was kidnapped
last night.

11:24.515 --> 11:26.298
They used your car.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.017
Oh, okay.

11:28.019 --> 11:30.219
Well, make it quick.

11:30.221 --> 11:33.022
I have a doctor's appointment.

11:33.024 --> 11:35.107
Seem nervous to you?
Hmm.

11:35.109 --> 11:37.393
She just doesn't want to be
late for her Botox shot.

11:37.395 --> 11:38.477
Wow.

11:38.479 --> 11:39.945
The surveillance footage

11:39.947 --> 11:42.064
on Allison Hall's house
is squeaky clean.

11:42.066 --> 11:43.616
And no way to
I.D. the guy

11:43.618 --> 11:44.818
who stole her
Mercedes, either.

11:44.819 --> 11:46.585
Cell phone and texts
seem to show

11:46.587 --> 11:48.370
nothing out of the ordinary.

11:48.372 --> 11:51.540
The only thing that's suspicious
is her credit card statement.

11:51.542 --> 11:53.876
$10,000 a month
at Barney's,

11:53.878 --> 11:56.545
Neiman Marcus, Saks?

11:56.547 --> 11:58.380
Poster child for S.A.

11:58.382 --> 12:00.115
It's Shopaholics
Anonymous.

12:00.117 --> 12:02.718
Mmm, trying
to cut back myself.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.136
You're a compulsive shopper?

12:04.138 --> 12:06.122
No, no, no--
collector.

12:06.124 --> 12:09.391
I can easily drop
two grand a month.

12:09.393 --> 12:11.293
On fantasy action figures?

12:11.295 --> 12:12.962
Yeah.

12:12.964 --> 12:14.346
That's an expensive hobby.

12:14.348 --> 12:16.265
Mmm, not a hobby;
it's an investment.

12:16.267 --> 12:18.400
The alien infantryman
I got last year

12:18.402 --> 12:22.438
for 1,000 bucks
now is worth $1,500.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.156
Impressive.

12:24.158 --> 12:25.474
Try getting that kind of return

12:25.476 --> 12:26.859
in the stock market.
Mmm...

12:26.861 --> 12:27.993
How about you?

12:27.995 --> 12:30.446
Any, uh, New Year's
resolutions?

12:30.448 --> 12:33.082
Well, mine are kind of
weird and personal, so...

12:33.084 --> 12:34.834
All right,
you don't have to tell me

12:34.836 --> 12:36.702
if you don't want to.

12:36.704 --> 12:38.337
No, it's okay.

12:38.339 --> 12:40.256
Okay, um...

12:40.258 --> 12:42.324
Do you know
when we're at work together...

12:42.326 --> 12:44.510
Yeah?

12:44.512 --> 12:46.462
Well, we are surrounded

12:46.464 --> 12:49.815
by these supercomputers and
satellites and databases.

12:49.817 --> 12:52.101
So, on the weekends,

12:52.103 --> 12:54.019
I've decided to
go unplugged.

12:54.021 --> 12:55.721
Meaning?

12:55.723 --> 12:58.390
No cell phone, e-mail, tex

12:58.392 --> 13:00.342
What if I have to call you?

13:00.344 --> 13:03.362
Why would you have to call me
on the weekend?

13:03.364 --> 13:05.931
If there was
an emergency at work.

13:05.933 --> 13:08.067
I'll have a pager.

13:08.069 --> 13:10.786
How very 1980s of you.

13:10.788 --> 13:12.738
So, uh...

13:12.740 --> 13:13.956
what's that number?

13:13.958 --> 13:15.457
Hetty has it.

13:16.493 --> 13:17.860
Kensi's going to need

13:17.862 --> 13:20.062
that smartphone app
really soon, so...

13:20.064 --> 13:21.580
how's it looking?

13:21.582 --> 13:24.116
I'm, uh... I'm all over it.

13:24.118 --> 13:25.384
Great.

13:25.386 --> 13:27.303
Great.
Great.

13:30.724 --> 13:32.541
No, no, no, those
are worth nothing.

13:32.543 --> 13:34.260
You jack an old
Honda, Toyota,

13:34.262 --> 13:35.511
chop them up in an hour,

13:35.513 --> 13:37.429
the parts
will get you three large.

13:37.431 --> 13:40.549
We're looking for someone
that specializes in SUVs.

13:40.551 --> 13:42.234
Luxury SUVs.

13:42.236 --> 13:45.604
Three rows, all the
bells and whistles.

13:45.606 --> 13:47.239
Jaime...

13:47.241 --> 13:49.224
What do you know?

13:49.226 --> 13:50.442
Nothing.

13:52.262 --> 13:54.113
Now, why don't we believe you?

13:55.498 --> 13:58.400
I know a guy that likes SUVs.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.819
A lot of guys like SUVs.

14:00.821 --> 14:04.406
I mean the ones
that you're looking for.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.457
He used to boost a few.

14:05.459 --> 14:07.960
Now it's more like 20 a month.

14:07.962 --> 14:09.979
What's his name?

14:09.981 --> 14:11.847
No.

14:11.849 --> 14:13.883
No, I can't.

14:13.885 --> 14:16.302
No, these are some badass dudes.

14:16.304 --> 14:18.637
They find out you're a snitch,
you're <i>muerto.</i>

14:18.639 --> 14:20.389
Jaime.

14:20.391 --> 14:22.024
We got your back.
Yeah, right.

14:22.026 --> 14:23.392
Someone to stay with you.

14:23.394 --> 14:25.060
Someone to keep you safe.

14:25.062 --> 14:27.563
Never gonna happen.

14:27.565 --> 14:29.097
I think that's your
new partner now.

14:31.401 --> 14:33.152
Hi.

14:34.170 --> 14:35.654
I'm Kensi Blye.

14:35.656 --> 14:37.406
Nice to meet you.

14:39.275 --> 14:41.160
For reals?

14:42.379 --> 14:44.446
And you're gonna pay me, too?

14:44.448 --> 14:46.615
Mm-hmm.
Top dollar.

14:51.137 --> 14:53.172
Well, I guess this
is starting to sound okay.

14:53.174 --> 14:54.306
Great.

14:54.308 --> 14:55.841
Now we just

14:55.843 --> 14:57.676
need you to get
Kensi into the crew

14:57.678 --> 14:58.811
as an undercover
car thief.

14:58.813 --> 15:01.013
<i>Estás loco.</i>

15:01.015 --> 15:02.765
What you been smoking, cuz?

15:02.767 --> 15:05.234
It'll never work.
These are OGs.

15:05.236 --> 15:08.737
They'll chop her up
and-and feed her to the dogs.

15:14.027 --> 15:15.611
<i>Oye,</i> you little bitch.

15:15.613 --> 15:18.664
You come at me again,
I will kick your sorry ass

15:18.666 --> 15:20.582
all the way to Chula Vista.

15:20.584 --> 15:22.451
You feel me?

15:26.490 --> 15:27.840
Damn.

15:27.842 --> 15:30.042
Where'd you find her?

15:30.910 --> 15:34.613
Cell phones, $14.99!

15:34.615 --> 15:36.382
Get 'em while they're hot!

15:36.384 --> 15:38.517
Get 'em while they're... phones.

15:38.519 --> 15:41.136
<i>Teléfonocellular-o.</i>

15:41.138 --> 15:42.388
<i>Muy barato!</i>

15:42.390 --> 15:45.858
<i>Llaman México,</i>
<i>gratis.</i>

15:45.860 --> 15:47.693
It's <i>"llamar a México."</i>
You don't have to

15:47.695 --> 15:48.894
conjugate the verb.

15:50.064 --> 15:52.197
Well, excuse me,
Dora the Explorer,

15:52.199 --> 15:54.233
but my undercover dude
failed high school

15:54.235 --> 15:55.401
Spanish.

15:55.403 --> 15:56.852
Probably not
the only thing he failed.

15:56.854 --> 15:57.936
Easy, tiger.

15:57.938 --> 16:00.289
I'm the one that's
got your back.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.474
And, seriously...

16:02.476 --> 16:06.145
keep an eye out
for Jenny in there.

16:06.147 --> 16:09.081
Bumper looks good,
but the finish is uneven.

16:09.083 --> 16:12.501
Next time, not so thick
on the paint, <i>vato.</i>

16:12.503 --> 16:13.986
What do have we here?

16:13.988 --> 16:15.671
Buenas tardes,
<i>Señor Esposito.</i>

16:17.707 --> 16:19.341
Jaime...

16:20.376 --> 16:22.011
...you big fat fool. Come here.

16:25.598 --> 16:27.215
Who's this flower?

16:27.217 --> 16:28.817
Oh, that's
my cousin, Carlotta.

16:28.819 --> 16:30.519
<i>Con mucho gusto.</i>

16:30.521 --> 16:32.071
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

16:34.057 --> 16:35.441
Oh, you brought me a gangster.

16:35.443 --> 16:37.526
How come they call
you Krafty?

16:37.528 --> 16:39.161
Something's wrong...

16:39.163 --> 16:40.362
I fix it.

16:40.364 --> 16:42.230
I bet you can.

16:42.232 --> 16:44.366
How come I never
seen you before?

16:44.368 --> 16:46.752
She's visiting.

16:47.737 --> 16:49.571
From Tucson.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.507
I guess you like it hot.

16:53.293 --> 16:56.178
If you came looking
for work, Jaime,

16:56.180 --> 16:58.180
you picked a bad day.

16:58.182 --> 17:00.549
Oh, not me, <i>mano.</i>

17:00.551 --> 17:02.768
My cousin Carlotta
needs a job.

17:02.770 --> 17:03.969
She's got mad skills.

17:03.971 --> 17:05.220
She can get you
any car you want

17:05.222 --> 17:06.555
just like this.
<i>Cállate!</i>

17:06.557 --> 17:08.190
<i>Estúpido.</i>

17:08.192 --> 17:09.608
You...

17:09.609 --> 17:12.778
you bring a stranger
into my place of business,

17:12.780 --> 17:13.979
and in front of her,

17:13.981 --> 17:15.564
you accuse me
of being a criminal?

17:15.566 --> 17:17.598
I know what you need-- I'm just
trying to help, you know?

17:17.601 --> 17:20.268
I can't even trust you not
to talk about what I do.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.319
Marco!

17:21.321 --> 17:23.071
Paco!

17:23.074 --> 17:25.574
Teach this <i>payaso</i> to
keep his mouth shut.

17:25.576 --> 17:27.576
Hey, we don't want no trouble.

17:27.578 --> 17:28.660
You let us walk out of here,

17:28.662 --> 17:30.062
I'll pretend I never
saw this place.

17:31.498 --> 17:33.248
Hey, hey! Yo,
that's my cousin!

17:41.792 --> 17:42.791
Come on, man!

17:42.793 --> 17:44.459
<i>Véngate!</i>

17:46.063 --> 17:48.130
<i>Alto!</i> S-S-Stop!
Stop. Stand back.

17:48.132 --> 17:50.649
That's one
tough <i>chica.</i>

17:52.352 --> 17:54.653
See what else you can do.

18:07.106 --> 18:09.474
When I was 12, I could
plug the windows,

18:09.476 --> 18:11.143
hot-wire the ignition.

18:11.145 --> 18:14.112
Yeah, well, these new keys
have a transponder chip.

18:14.114 --> 18:16.148
Without it, the fuel
and starter systems

18:16.150 --> 18:18.283
are totally dead.

18:18.285 --> 18:20.068
If you don't know that,
why are we here?

18:21.621 --> 18:24.072
'Cause I'm with the functions.

18:24.074 --> 18:26.324
Memorized the VIN.

18:28.244 --> 18:30.278
What are you doing?
Remember that commercial

18:30.280 --> 18:31.630
where the lady
can't find her key

18:31.632 --> 18:32.998
and the baby's all, like,
crying inside the car

18:33.000 --> 18:34.983
and the operator
has to save her ass?

18:34.985 --> 18:36.835
Yeah.

18:36.837 --> 18:38.720
I got friends
who know computers.

18:38.722 --> 18:40.255
Here we go.

18:40.257 --> 18:42.808
Alarm off.

18:44.228 --> 18:46.294
You're kidding me, right?

18:46.296 --> 18:47.345
No.

18:47.347 --> 18:49.797
Let's unlock the doors.

18:49.799 --> 18:51.683
Let's start the engine.

18:54.605 --> 18:56.404
I don't believe it.

18:56.406 --> 18:57.939
Reel him in, Krafty.

18:57.941 --> 18:59.841
What are we waiting for?

18:59.843 --> 19:02.761
You could do
this to any car?

19:02.763 --> 19:05.480
Pretty much.

19:07.316 --> 19:09.334
May we be of further assistance?

19:09.336 --> 19:11.620
You hungry?

19:11.622 --> 19:13.004
Well, I show a Krispy Kreme

19:13.006 --> 19:15.090
a mile on the right--
I think you need it.

19:15.092 --> 19:16.124
Ah, I'm good.

19:16.126 --> 19:17.175
Drive safely, ma'am,

19:17.177 --> 19:18.844
'cause we are always
here for you.

19:18.846 --> 19:20.595
This could work out, <i>chica.</i>

19:20.597 --> 19:22.681
This could
seriously work out.

19:33.392 --> 19:34.976
Ah, what the hell, man?

19:36.562 --> 19:38.730
You didn't come to a complete stop.
Yeah, I did!

19:38.732 --> 19:40.532
This is why
I never take girls in my crew.

19:40.534 --> 19:41.816
Are you crazy?

19:41.818 --> 19:43.184
From head to toe.

19:43.186 --> 19:44.678
<i>You can't run from the cops.</i>

19:44.679 --> 19:45.722
I did in Tucson.

19:45.747 --> 19:47.623
This is L.A., girl--
they got helicopters.

19:47.624 --> 19:49.624
In about two minutes,
we're gonna be up on CNN.

19:49.626 --> 19:50.909
In two minutes, I'll be losing

19:50.911 --> 19:51.993
their sorry ass.

19:55.698 --> 19:57.382
Whoo!

20:07.760 --> 20:09.678
Oh, no, no, you can't,
you can't go... No!

20:09.680 --> 20:11.062
Close your eyes, <i>niña.</i>

20:21.056 --> 20:23.224
Kensi, you drive
like an old lady.

20:23.226 --> 20:24.892
Could have totally
nailed your ass.

20:28.832 --> 20:31.783
Put it over there on the left.

20:31.785 --> 20:33.702
<i>Damn, that was some driving,</i>
<i>girl.</i>

20:33.704 --> 20:35.787
<i>Whew.</i>

20:40.743 --> 20:42.210
What do we do now, man?

20:42.212 --> 20:44.462
Nothing. It cools
off for a day,

20:44.464 --> 20:45.680
make sure there's
no LoJack,

20:45.682 --> 20:47.382
and then someone
else takes over.

20:47.384 --> 20:49.434
Wait, you sell the car
to somebody else?

20:49.436 --> 20:51.436
Something like that.

20:51.438 --> 20:52.771
And then...

20:52.773 --> 20:54.272
where do they take them?

20:54.274 --> 20:57.091
Far away, across
the deep blue sea.

20:57.093 --> 20:59.594
Forget about it.
You just made 1,500 bucks.

20:59.596 --> 21:01.062
That's cool.

21:01.064 --> 21:03.865
And it can go
up from there.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.401
You like tequila?

21:06.403 --> 21:08.370
Who doesn't?

21:08.372 --> 21:11.323
We should celebrate. You
want to get a drink tonight?

21:11.325 --> 21:13.274
I can't, man.
I'm busy.

21:13.276 --> 21:14.909
Doing what?

21:14.911 --> 21:16.277
I got plans.

21:16.279 --> 21:17.963
So break 'em.

21:17.965 --> 21:20.999
You just got a new job
that's gonna make you rich.

21:21.001 --> 21:23.251
I think it's
time to party.

21:24.286 --> 21:26.504
It's my mother.

21:26.506 --> 21:29.957
We're making tamales
for <i>laCandelaria,</i> you know?

21:29.959 --> 21:32.894
Oh. Why didn't you say so?

21:32.896 --> 21:35.963
Another time, then.

21:35.965 --> 21:39.934
What's more important
than <i>la familia?</i>

21:48.828 --> 21:50.412
According
to the registrar's office,

21:50.414 --> 21:53.865
Talia has a 2:00 p.m.
psychology lecture.

21:53.867 --> 21:56.785
Send Mr. Callen
and Mr. Hanna to the scene.

21:56.787 --> 21:58.536
Crockett, Tubbs,

21:58.538 --> 21:59.987
you still with me?

22:01.824 --> 22:04.793
It's, uh... their code names
for the operation.

22:04.795 --> 22:06.845
Roger that, dispatch.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.496
How close to downtown?

22:08.498 --> 22:09.764
Five minutes.

22:09.766 --> 22:10.932
We've been running

22:10.934 --> 22:13.268
Talia's electronic
footprint.

22:13.270 --> 22:15.854
She claims to have lost touch
with her mother.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.506
Not according to her e-mails
or her phone records.

22:18.508 --> 22:20.642
She's got something to hide.

22:20.644 --> 22:22.110
Where is she?

22:22.112 --> 22:23.862
We've been keeping tabs
on Talia's cell phone.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.648
At the moment,
she's stopping every two blocks.

22:26.650 --> 22:28.182
Even the
green lights.

22:28.184 --> 22:30.518
You think she's on a bus?

22:30.520 --> 22:33.788
Either that or she's selling
Girl Scout cookies.

22:44.183 --> 22:47.218
Red hair. That's her.

22:47.220 --> 22:50.055
I got a bad feeling about this.
Not necessarily.

22:50.057 --> 22:52.507
She could be volunteering
at a soup kitchen.

22:57.847 --> 22:59.013
Hey!

22:59.015 --> 23:00.432
Told you.

23:02.569 --> 23:04.502
Give it to me! Let go! Let go!
Stop!

23:06.222 --> 23:07.388
I'll check the girl.
You got him?

23:07.390 --> 23:08.907
I got him.

23:10.359 --> 23:12.727
Are you okay?
I think so.

23:25.074 --> 23:28.093
Hey! Hey!

23:29.411 --> 23:31.763
Eric! We got a fleeing suspect

23:31.765 --> 23:34.265
on a motorcycle--
Latino male in his 20s,

23:34.267 --> 23:36.017
black hoodie.

23:36.019 --> 23:38.269
Roger that.

23:38.271 --> 23:39.971
I'm Special
Agent San Hanna.

23:39.973 --> 23:41.523
We know about your mom.

23:41.525 --> 23:43.558
You got something
you want to tell us?

23:43.560 --> 23:44.893
Yeah.

23:44.895 --> 23:47.479
Now they're going to kill her.

23:59.697 --> 24:01.580
When did they call?

24:01.582 --> 24:04.950
It woke me up.
6:00 in the morning.

24:04.952 --> 24:06.535
Caller I.D.?

24:06.537 --> 24:08.120
Blocked.

24:08.122 --> 24:10.239
They told me to bring my laptop
to Hollenbeck Park

24:10.241 --> 24:11.374
or they'd kill my mom.

24:11.376 --> 24:12.908
And don't even
think about

24:12.910 --> 24:14.210
going to the police.

24:14.212 --> 24:17.930
Which is why you lied
to Kensi and Deeks.

24:17.932 --> 24:19.765
We're going to help you.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.550
You showed up dressed like cops.

24:21.552 --> 24:23.135
I don't want her to die.

24:23.137 --> 24:25.221
They need something
off your computer.

24:25.223 --> 24:26.722
They don't have it.

24:26.724 --> 24:29.258
Which means she could
still be safe.

24:32.646 --> 24:36.148
People must think I hate her
for being homeless.

24:36.150 --> 24:39.034
But that's just
how it was.

24:39.036 --> 24:42.071
I mean, she did her best,
always had me under her wing.

24:42.073 --> 24:44.790
I mean, she used to help me
with my homework by streetlight

24:44.792 --> 24:45.825
if she had to.

24:45.827 --> 24:47.877
I wouldn't have

24:47.879 --> 24:49.295
made it without her.

24:49.297 --> 24:51.613
She sounds like a great mother.

24:54.334 --> 24:56.618
Last time you two talked?

24:56.620 --> 24:59.054
Day before yesterday.

24:59.056 --> 25:01.056
Did she mention
anybody that would

25:01.058 --> 25:03.476
want to hurt her?
No.

25:06.229 --> 25:07.963
I hate to bring this up,

25:07.965 --> 25:10.683
but we know she
had a drug problem.

25:10.685 --> 25:12.968
Clean and sober for three years.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.855
She was getting it together,
learning accounting.

25:15.857 --> 25:17.823
She was good with numbers.

25:17.825 --> 25:21.076
Even got a few part-time jobs
as a bookkeeper to help save up

25:21.078 --> 25:22.027
for an apartment.

25:22.029 --> 25:25.331
Sorry. Are we interrupting?

25:25.333 --> 25:26.582
What do you have?

25:26.584 --> 25:27.816
No luck
on the park attacker.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.168
He ditched the
bike and ran.

25:29.170 --> 25:30.786
And there are about
a thousand guys

25:30.788 --> 25:32.505
with hoodies in
that neighborhood.

25:32.507 --> 25:34.957
Check a blocked call
to Talia's cell around 6:00 a.m.

25:34.959 --> 25:36.375
- On it.
- How about the laptop?

25:36.377 --> 25:38.427
Well, three days ago,
her mom

25:38.429 --> 25:41.663
sent an e-mail, subject,
uh, "Save this for me."

25:41.665 --> 25:44.311
There was an attachment.
Some file I couldn't open.

25:44.315 --> 25:46.064
Neither can we.
It's password-protected.

25:46.089 --> 25:47.137
Since when has

25:47.138 --> 25:49.004
- that ever been a problem?
- It's not an alphanumeric

25:49.006 --> 25:51.807
password-- it requires
an audio file.

25:52.859 --> 25:54.360
A voice match?

25:54.362 --> 25:56.011
That's usually
the case.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.731
Probably Talia's voice
or Jenny's voice.

25:58.733 --> 26:01.033
Uh, we fed samples of their
voice mails to each other

26:01.035 --> 26:04.069
into a deciphering program,
but... that could take hours.

26:04.071 --> 26:06.372
If the protected files
contain damaging evidence,

26:06.374 --> 26:08.874
whoever's after Jenny
would want it destroyed.

26:08.876 --> 26:11.410
That's why they need
Talia's laptop and password.

26:11.412 --> 26:12.862
We also found

26:12.864 --> 26:14.079
a second e-mail that said,

26:14.081 --> 26:17.032
"The key is in the stack."
Key?

26:17.034 --> 26:19.001
I was going to borrow her car.

26:19.003 --> 26:20.803
What's the stack?

26:20.805 --> 26:22.755
I don't know.
The library?

26:22.757 --> 26:24.423
She ever leave her key
for you at the library?

26:24.425 --> 26:27.476
"The key is
in the stack""

26:27.478 --> 26:29.094
It's got to be a message
about how to access

26:29.096 --> 26:30.396
the protected file.

26:30.398 --> 26:32.648
"Stack" is a computer term,
right?

26:32.650 --> 26:36.435
Uh, abstract-type linear data
structure. Nothing like it

26:36.437 --> 26:37.937
on Talia's laptop.
Ooh.

26:37.939 --> 26:39.772
We got a hit
on the 6:00 a.m. call.

26:39.774 --> 26:42.892
It was made from a pay phone
at a bus station.

26:42.894 --> 26:45.211
We've got some old-school
bad guys.

26:45.213 --> 26:46.779
Check security cameras.

26:46.781 --> 26:48.781
We'll try and find the stack.

26:48.783 --> 26:50.049
Whatever that is.

26:59.259 --> 27:01.260
Anything in the magazines?

27:01.262 --> 27:02.962
Nothing.

27:02.964 --> 27:04.463
It's Talia.

27:04.465 --> 27:06.649
Call me when you can.

27:06.651 --> 27:08.784
I love you, Mom.

27:08.786 --> 27:10.052
We're running
out of time here.

27:10.054 --> 27:11.437
You really think
the secret message

27:11.439 --> 27:14.256
is on a T-shirt?
Try reading this.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.058
"If you judge people,

27:16.060 --> 27:18.594
you have no time
to love them""

27:18.596 --> 27:19.761
Mother Teresa.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.564
Nice.

27:21.566 --> 27:23.449
But it's not "open sesame."

27:23.451 --> 27:25.401
Stack of books over there.

27:25.403 --> 27:28.437
I don't know, G. Eric said
the password was an audio file--

27:28.439 --> 27:30.105
it doesn't have to be words.

27:30.107 --> 27:32.374
All right, so we could also
be looking for a thumb drive

27:32.376 --> 27:34.376
or a voice recorder
or a... CD-ROM.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.830
Music CDs?

27:37.832 --> 27:39.448
Give it a try.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.799
Anything in here?

27:40.801 --> 27:42.117
Index cards. All blank.

27:42.119 --> 27:44.303
What's this?
Birthday cards,

27:44.305 --> 27:46.922
Valentine's Day, graduation--
I save them all.

27:46.924 --> 27:49.308
It's a stack.
Mom couldn't afford presents,

27:49.310 --> 27:50.726
but she always got me a card.

27:50.728 --> 27:53.062
Do you mind?
Go ahead.

27:54.814 --> 27:55.898
<i>Sketches of Spain.</i>

27:55.900 --> 27:57.433
Vintage Miles.

27:57.435 --> 27:58.984
With Gil Evans.

27:58.986 --> 28:00.269
My mom's.

28:00.271 --> 28:02.271
She has good taste.

28:08.362 --> 28:09.862
I know that song.

28:09.864 --> 28:14.650
♪ I can't give you anything
but love ♪

28:14.652 --> 28:16.702
♪ Baby

28:16.704 --> 28:19.655
She used to sing it to me
when I was little for a lully.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.457
So it was a pretty cool
birthday card.

28:21.459 --> 28:23.459
Think the song is a key?

28:23.461 --> 28:25.628
We found it in a stack.

28:32.436 --> 28:33.769
Bingo.

28:35.972 --> 28:36.939
Looks like we hit the jackpot.

28:36.941 --> 28:39.358
"Old VIN," "new VIN."

28:39.360 --> 28:41.477
They're changing 'em over
so they can't be traced.

28:41.479 --> 28:42.945
Esposito's just the middleman.

28:42.947 --> 28:45.481
We need to find the big fish
that's shipping them overseas.

28:46.282 --> 28:48.367
"Gonzalo Vargas,

28:48.369 --> 28:50.519
Primoroso Landscaping."

28:50.521 --> 28:52.371
I'm sending
a screenshot to Ops.

28:52.373 --> 28:55.074
How did my mom get
all of this stuff?

28:55.076 --> 28:57.376
She is a very thorough
bookkeeper.

28:57.378 --> 28:58.877
I guess so.

28:58.879 --> 29:00.045
How we doing, Eric?

29:00.047 --> 29:02.364
Okay, I found Vargas.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.583
Sending you the info now.

29:05.468 --> 29:06.669
There's our man.

29:06.671 --> 29:08.637
Eric, get me a 20 on this guy.

29:08.639 --> 29:10.673
Already working on
tracing his cell phone.

29:10.675 --> 29:12.975
Landscaping company in Bel Air,
Brentwood and Beverly Hills.

29:12.977 --> 29:14.476
That's the perfect cover.

29:14.478 --> 29:17.229
He's casing luxury SUVs
from behind the bushes.

29:20.183 --> 29:24.436
13, 14, 15.

29:26.072 --> 29:28.057
One for my cuz
'cause you hooked me up.

29:28.059 --> 29:29.074
Sweet!

29:29.076 --> 29:30.642
Hey. You hear they

29:30.644 --> 29:31.944
opened Jenny's file?

29:31.946 --> 29:34.263
Yeah. Password was
in a birthday card.

29:34.265 --> 29:35.748
Isn't that amazing?

29:35.750 --> 29:37.249
A birthday card.

29:37.251 --> 29:39.785
Mad props for bringing her in, J-dog.
Thanks.

29:39.787 --> 29:41.954
That's cool.

29:41.956 --> 29:44.239
Hey, what's with the fireworks?

29:46.126 --> 29:47.593
He must be welding under there.

29:47.595 --> 29:49.428
No, man, that's an engraver.

29:49.430 --> 29:52.531
Dawg, you changing
the VIN numbers.

29:52.533 --> 29:54.933
Wow, you get some
fake DMV papers,

29:54.935 --> 29:57.386
you get those things through
customs, you ship 'em

29:57.388 --> 29:59.304
anywhere!
So how many tamales

29:59.306 --> 30:00.439
you gonna make?

30:02.059 --> 30:03.392
Double batch.

30:03.394 --> 30:05.444
About 40.
Now, with two of you,

30:05.446 --> 30:07.112
it should be quick, so...

30:07.114 --> 30:08.614
tomorrow night?

30:08.616 --> 30:09.648
You and me?

30:09.650 --> 30:10.766
We should
hang out, right?

30:10.768 --> 30:11.917
You kidding me?

30:11.919 --> 30:13.935
Can he be any more
of a sleazeball?

30:14.771 --> 30:16.572
Maybe not.

30:16.574 --> 30:17.939
Why not?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.274
She doesn't want to, man.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.293
No, this don't
involve you, <i>tonto.</i>

30:21.295 --> 30:23.362
Got him.

30:23.364 --> 30:25.931
Your suspect is traveling
north on Tujunga,

30:25.933 --> 30:27.833
turning west on Penrose.

30:27.835 --> 30:30.118
He's headed for
the auto body shop.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.205
Deeks, you're getting a visitor.

30:33.207 --> 30:35.057
Oh, crap.

30:35.059 --> 30:36.792
Kensi, you're about to get made.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.144
Get her out of there.
Stay with us.

30:39.146 --> 30:42.014
You shouldn't go out with her.
I'm talking about a drink!

30:42.016 --> 30:43.649
Kensi, leave the building now.

30:43.651 --> 30:44.850
Right now!

30:48.104 --> 30:50.355
Hey, you tell 'em I'm
going to the bathroom.

30:50.357 --> 30:51.907
We'll come back for you.

30:51.909 --> 30:54.326
<i>Jefe, ¿cómo estás?</i>
Hey.

30:54.328 --> 30:55.861
Escalade ready?

30:55.863 --> 30:57.613
About to take it
to Long Beach.

30:57.615 --> 30:58.831
The bathroom window is open.

30:58.833 --> 31:00.199
Kensi, get the hell out
of there.

31:00.201 --> 31:01.700
Krafty.

31:01.702 --> 31:02.868
Yo, Krafty!

31:02.870 --> 31:04.036
Yeah, she's going
to the bathroom.

31:04.038 --> 31:05.337
Keep moving, Kens!

31:05.339 --> 31:06.455
Just a minute!

31:06.457 --> 31:07.923
I want you to
meet our boss.

31:07.925 --> 31:09.608
Stop.

31:09.610 --> 31:11.376
Turn around.
Show him some respect.

31:11.378 --> 31:14.763
Heard some good
things about you.

31:14.765 --> 31:16.181
Hey.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.935
Mamacita...

31:19.937 --> 31:22.170
I met you before?

31:22.172 --> 31:23.722
You ever been to Arizona?

31:23.724 --> 31:25.307
Turn around.

31:25.309 --> 31:27.025
All the way.

31:28.728 --> 31:31.480
Okay, I need backup, Eric--
LAPD, anybody, A.S.A.P.

31:31.482 --> 31:33.065
On it.

31:37.537 --> 31:40.372
I know her.
She's a damn cop.

31:40.374 --> 31:41.707
What are you trippin' about?

31:41.709 --> 31:43.542
No, she's hard-core, dawg.
She outran the LAPD.

31:43.544 --> 31:45.527
No, nothing
but show, man.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.362
She was up at the house
where we boosted the Benz.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.214
She was talking to the lady like
she's a detective or something.

31:49.216 --> 31:50.332
No. Man.

31:50.334 --> 31:51.884
You're thinking
of somebody else.

31:51.886 --> 31:54.169
Hey, this is
my cuz, I swear.

31:54.171 --> 31:58.206
No. Those eyes.

32:00.042 --> 32:03.011
The figure.

32:08.050 --> 32:11.770
The Sig.

32:11.772 --> 32:13.405
It was you, <i>puta.</i>

32:14.657 --> 32:15.724
You taking up
with the cops, homes?

32:15.726 --> 32:17.943
On your knees.

32:17.945 --> 32:19.161
Both of you.

32:21.497 --> 32:23.231
This is messed up, E.
No, I'll take care of it.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.499
You're wrong.
She's not a cop.

32:24.501 --> 32:25.901
You're right.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.870
She's not a cop.

32:29.122 --> 32:30.839
She's a dead cop.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.968
I thought she was real.
I thought she was down.

32:49.971 --> 32:50.708
Shut up, fool.

32:50.710 --> 32:52.010
Hey, you don't
want to do this.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.512
We got files
from your bookkeeper.

32:54.514 --> 32:57.215
Details of every SUV and
where they went in Asia.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.602
Now's the time
to be smart, man.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.237
Put your guns down.

33:02.239 --> 33:03.571
Turn yourselves in.

33:03.573 --> 33:06.057
You got balls, <i>mija.</i>

33:06.059 --> 33:07.492
Eric, I need an ETA
on Callen and Sam.

33:07.494 --> 33:08.743
Three minutes.

33:08.745 --> 33:10.445
We don't have three minutes.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.914
So if you know everything,
how come nobody's come for me?

33:14.166 --> 33:16.201
They're on their way.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.902
They are?

33:17.904 --> 33:19.737
She's bluffing.

33:19.739 --> 33:21.572
You kill me,

33:21.574 --> 33:23.625
you get the death
penalty, get it?

33:23.627 --> 33:25.260
They've got to catch me first.

33:25.262 --> 33:26.861
Oh!

33:26.863 --> 33:29.097
I'm so sorry.

33:29.099 --> 33:32.133
I'm so sorry. I didn't think
this thing was gonna be so wide.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.227
What are you doing?

33:33.252 --> 33:35.554
I am going door-to-door to offer
you an incredible opportunity.

33:35.555 --> 33:39.174
This, my friend, is two
free days of promotion

33:39.176 --> 33:42.644
and marketing
on this spectacular sign. Now,

33:42.646 --> 33:44.362
just last week, I was
across the street.

33:44.364 --> 33:45.730
Doubled their
walk-in customers.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.565
And obviously, I can't
guarantee that that's

33:47.567 --> 33:49.600
gonna happen for you guys,
but this is an offer

33:49.602 --> 33:51.953
that you can't refuse.
We're not interested.

33:51.955 --> 33:53.388
You don't understand.
There's no money up front.

33:53.390 --> 33:56.825
There's no risk.
Take off, gringo!

33:56.827 --> 33:58.776
Whoa. Whoa. Gringo?
All right, there's...

33:58.778 --> 34:01.046
there's no reason
to start calling people names.

34:01.048 --> 34:03.715
Don't move!
Drop it.

34:03.717 --> 34:05.750
Put it down.

34:10.791 --> 34:13.257
That wasn't so smart,
now, was it?

34:13.260 --> 34:15.844
Now, toss it
to the ground.

34:15.846 --> 34:17.562
Toss it to the ground!

34:30.860 --> 34:32.777
Careful, amigo.
Those are designer frames.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.812
It's her partner.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.284
This is your cavalry?

34:39.286 --> 34:41.119
Huh?!
On your knees with your friends.

34:41.121 --> 34:44.371
Tie their hands.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.801
Stay in the car.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.720
Keep down.
Is my mom in there?

34:58.722 --> 35:00.805
Let's hope so.

35:06.228 --> 35:08.346
You ever drive
a tow truck, G.?

35:08.348 --> 35:09.948
We'll take 'em
to the yard.

35:09.950 --> 35:11.866
Now we got four bodies
to get rid of.

35:11.868 --> 35:13.118
Grab some duct tape,

35:13.120 --> 35:14.836
tarps and shovels.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.872
Federal agents.
Drop your weapons!

35:30.252 --> 35:32.337
Deeks, on your 6:00!

35:38.344 --> 35:40.528
Callen, on your 6:00!

35:43.933 --> 35:46.884
Deeks?
I'm good.

35:47.886 --> 35:50.939
Kensi?
Kensi?!

35:52.057 --> 35:54.325
I don't know anyone
named Kensi.

35:55.861 --> 35:58.229
Let her go.
Step away from the truck!

35:59.915 --> 36:01.749
Drop the weapon,
and no one gets hurt.

36:01.751 --> 36:03.668
- Keep walking. Back off.
- Look at me.

36:03.670 --> 36:05.954
You can't get away.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.455
If I die, she dies!

36:07.457 --> 36:10.508
Guys... lower
your weapons, please.

36:11.844 --> 36:13.428
Be smart.
Listen to your girl.

36:13.430 --> 36:15.580
Drop your weapon!

36:15.582 --> 36:19.017
Kensi, you good?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

36:25.424 --> 36:26.474
Excuse me?

36:26.476 --> 36:28.443
Little help here.

36:29.762 --> 36:31.146
I get it, Kens.
Hold up your wrist.

36:33.033 --> 36:34.282
Guys?

36:34.284 --> 36:35.783
Where did they
put Jenny?

36:35.785 --> 36:37.035
Check all the closets
and storerooms.

36:37.037 --> 36:38.119
Jenny?!
Jenny?!

36:38.121 --> 36:39.937
Got to check the yard.

36:39.939 --> 36:41.289
So where do we start?

36:41.291 --> 36:43.074
According to the manifest,

36:43.076 --> 36:44.909
he's shipping out three SUVs
tomorrow to Singapore.

36:44.911 --> 36:48.329
Okay, we start with the
shipping containers.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.331
A lot of containers.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.050
She could be anywhere.

36:52.052 --> 36:54.002
Hey, Eric, pan over
with the infrared.

36:54.004 --> 36:56.588
Doing it as we speak.

36:56.590 --> 36:59.257
We got something,
but it's not moving.

36:59.259 --> 37:02.227
A dead body can radiate heat
for eight hours.

37:02.229 --> 37:03.895
Sending you GPS coordinates.

37:14.491 --> 37:16.274
There's no ventilation
in there.

37:16.276 --> 37:18.809
Feels like 120 degrees.
She could be baked by now.

37:20.162 --> 37:22.947
Jenny? Jenny,
can you hear me?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.332
Jenny, open your eyes.

37:24.334 --> 37:25.667
We need to cool her down.

37:25.669 --> 37:27.869
Come on. Get her out.

37:29.139 --> 37:30.821
Mom!
Give them room to work.

37:30.823 --> 37:32.823
Is she okay?
I think so.

37:32.825 --> 37:33.841
I'll call an ambulance.

37:33.843 --> 37:35.293
Oh, my God.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.461
Get her some water.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.329
Marty.
Mom!

37:38.331 --> 37:39.681
Marty.

37:39.683 --> 37:41.132
It's okay. It's okay.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.517
Mom.
Baby.

37:42.519 --> 37:44.953
You're okay.

37:44.955 --> 37:46.421
I thought I lost you.

37:46.423 --> 37:48.339
You are never gonna lose me.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.146
Here.
Oh, thank you.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.565
So, Jenny, I take it
you did some, uh,

37:57.567 --> 38:00.017
bookkeeping for Vargas?

38:00.019 --> 38:02.820
For, like, five bucks an hour.
Cheap bastard.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.022
Yeah, well, you didn't get mad;
you got even.

38:05.024 --> 38:07.158
Why'd you wait so long if
you had the information?

38:07.160 --> 38:10.762
I wanted to tie everything up
in a bow.

38:10.764 --> 38:12.080
Marty always told me,

38:12.082 --> 38:14.865
"Don't come to me
with half a story."

38:14.867 --> 38:16.751
You did great.

38:27.012 --> 38:29.480
Yes, 8:00 is perfect.

38:29.482 --> 38:32.650
Table for two under
the name Blye.

38:32.652 --> 38:35.069
Great. Thank you
very much. Bye.

38:35.071 --> 38:38.273
You remember that orange soda
you had for lunch?

38:38.275 --> 38:39.774
Yeah.

38:39.776 --> 38:41.326
Well, 41 milligrams of caffeine.

38:42.778 --> 38:44.946
Oranges do not have caffeine.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.448
Well, there aren't any oranges
in what you were drinking.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.617
Just corn syrup,
red dye 40,

38:49.619 --> 38:52.120
yellow dye six, caffeine.

38:52.122 --> 38:54.422
Mm-hmm. Why didn't you tell me?

38:54.424 --> 38:57.041
You were irritable.
It was driving me crazy.

38:57.043 --> 38:57.797
Uh-huh.

38:57.822 --> 38:59.795
And how are you,
Miss No Refined Sugar?

38:59.796 --> 39:03.097
Good, actually.

39:03.099 --> 39:05.600
What is that on your chin?

39:05.602 --> 39:07.101
What?

39:07.103 --> 39:09.604
Looks like chocolate.

39:09.606 --> 39:11.222
It is not.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.607
Let me see.

39:12.609 --> 39:14.776
It's chocolate.

39:14.778 --> 39:16.594
Oh, you know what?

39:16.596 --> 39:18.363
That's organic carob
from a protein bar.

39:18.365 --> 39:20.231
Yeah.
Where's the wrapper?

39:20.233 --> 39:21.816
I don't know.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.736
No, no, no. Sam...

39:24.738 --> 39:27.271
32 grams of sugar.

39:27.273 --> 39:29.273
That's like eating
a big chunk of fudge.

39:29.275 --> 39:30.775
- Fail.
- Excuse me.

39:30.777 --> 39:32.610
I had a gun pointed
at me today.

39:32.612 --> 39:34.045
Okay?

39:34.047 --> 39:35.580
Why are you all dressed up?

39:35.582 --> 39:38.099
What, this old thing?

39:38.101 --> 39:39.417
Just got a little dusty
out the.

39:39.419 --> 39:41.085
So, Esposito's gang

39:41.087 --> 39:43.621
was netting
$100,000 per SUV.

39:43.623 --> 39:45.590
Clearing $2 million a month.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.141
They're returning the cars
to all the owners?

39:47.143 --> 39:49.126
No, we're reimbursing them.

39:49.128 --> 39:50.311
They're going to ship

39:50.313 --> 39:51.646
the cars overseas

39:51.648 --> 39:52.797
as originally planned.

39:52.799 --> 39:54.599
Really?

39:54.601 --> 39:58.319
With some significant
after-market modifications.

39:58.321 --> 40:00.038
Nice.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.189
We'll be able to track

40:01.191 --> 40:02.640
every vehicle.

40:02.642 --> 40:03.908
Listen in on every conversation.

40:03.910 --> 40:06.194
A treasure trove
of intelligence.

40:06.196 --> 40:08.946
I believe a toast
is in order.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.148
Look at this.

40:11.150 --> 40:14.502
A rare 2002 from Reims.

40:14.504 --> 40:16.587
For the New Year?
No.

40:16.589 --> 40:18.122
For Mr. Deeks' birthday.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.157
No way.

40:20.159 --> 40:21.492
Seriously?

40:21.494 --> 40:22.927
I thought
it was on the 18th.

40:22.929 --> 40:24.545
Uh, yeah, nice try.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.331
Actually, I heard you making
dinner reservations, so...

40:29.101 --> 40:31.085
That was with somebody else.

40:31.087 --> 40:32.670
Yeah, right.

40:32.672 --> 40:34.889
What, are you serious?

40:34.891 --> 40:37.608
Sorry, Hetty.
I don't mean to be messy.

40:37.610 --> 40:38.676
It's my birthday.

40:38.678 --> 40:40.111
Here you go,
birthday boy.

40:40.113 --> 40:42.513
Thanks.
Thank you.

40:42.515 --> 40:44.014
To Mr. Deeks.

40:44.016 --> 40:45.616
Long may he run.

40:45.618 --> 40:47.985
Cheers!
Happy birthday!

40:47.987 --> 40:50.121
Happy birthday, Deeks.
Happy birthday!

40:50.123 --> 40:51.122
Happy birthday, boy.

40:51.124 --> 40:52.240
Cheers, cheers.
Happy birthday.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.041
Eye contact.

40:54.043 --> 40:56.294
Happy birthday.

40:56.296 --> 40:59.630
Hey, uh,

40:59.632 --> 41:02.500
I'm the one that's going
to dinner, right?

41:03.836 --> 41:06.537
♪

41:09.725 --> 41:11.843
Hi.

41:13.395 --> 41:14.979
Hey, you look nice.

41:14.981 --> 41:17.548
Really nice.
Thank you for doing this.

41:17.550 --> 41:19.150
Thank you for saving my life.

41:19.152 --> 41:20.768
It's the least I could do.

41:20.770 --> 41:23.554
Oh, this is my
mother, Guadalupe.

41:23.556 --> 41:25.222
Mama...

41:44.042 --> 41:47.345
So... what are we drinking?

41:47.347 --> 41:49.046
Margaritas.
You want one?

41:49.048 --> 41:50.515
Yes, please.

41:50.517 --> 41:52.683
Make that a double.

42:01.226 --> 42:06.226

42:10.069 --> 42:13.988
Ay, caramba.
