All I ever wanted since
I first saw the stars

00:30.900 --> 00:32.597
was to join Starfleet.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.034
I'm an Illyrian. I've committed
a Federation offense.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.949
If you shelter me
they could come after you, too.

She won't take my calls either.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.484
This is not a plum case.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.094
I'm gonna talk to her myself,
face-to-face.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.791
Just hang in there,

If we go into the hospital,
they might see her

01:10.026 --> 01:12.985

They'll run tests to find out.

-I know, baby.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.902
I know it hurts.

You're gonna be okay.

I promise.

Her system can't handle it.

She is a child.
She needs a doctor.

Look, if we go to
the hospital now, they'll see,

01:31.917 --> 01:33.658
and we'll lose everything.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.443
Her life will be ruined,

Una, you don't
want to drag this out.

It's a good deal,

02:17.398 --> 02:20.444
She's right.
We won't get better.

This charge can carry
two years imprisonment

Yes, I told him.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.312
Starfleet Command
found out that she's Illyrian.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.619
It was only a matter of time
before she was outed.

04:31.662 --> 04:34.709
Starfleet will never let
an Illyrian serve. Not openly.

04:34.752 --> 04:38.103
But that is not
my problem, Mr. Pike.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.454

have a busy day.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.325

I don't know what happened

04:45.981 --> 04:49.158
Una Chin-Riley is not my friend,
and neither are you.

04:49.201 --> 04:52.335
-Please leave.
-I know why you feel the way
you do about Starfleet,

04:52.379 --> 04:54.206
the Federation, all of us.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.860
I saw some things.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.993
On a research mission
to an abandoned Illyrian colony,

04:58.036 --> 05:01.910
we found out that
it wasn't so... abandoned.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.781
I saw what can happen
to Illyrians

05:03.825 --> 05:05.609
who reverse
their genetic modification

05:05.653 --> 05:09.526
just so the Federation
will accept them.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.833
Old fears can be hard
to let go of,

05:11.876 --> 05:15.445
but we were wrong
about Illyrians. All of us.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.362
I was wrong.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.496
Congratulations.
You discovered empathy.

05:22.539 --> 05:25.586
Let me know when the rest
of your Federation catches up.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.330
They're going to dismiss her.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.637
Everything she's strived for,
her life's work,

05:33.681 --> 05:35.291
her entire career.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.511
Everything that
she's contributed.

05:37.554 --> 05:40.949
Dishonorable dismissal
is getting off easy.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.430
Starfleet race laws
are draconian.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.606
She's lucky she isn't getting
charged with sedition.

05:47.521 --> 05:51.263
Yes, Mr. Pike,
I am familiar with her case.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.701
The proceedings are sealed.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.442
I make it my business
to know what happens

05:55.485 --> 05:56.921
behind closed doors.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.707
Many of my clients' lives
depend on it.

05:59.750 --> 06:03.188
Now, if that will be all.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.238
How's that working out for you?

06:09.281 --> 06:11.762
-The cases against
the Federation.
-Excuse me?

06:11.806 --> 06:13.590
See, I do my homework, too.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.766
Ten cases thrown out
or overturned

06:15.810 --> 06:17.768
in two years
for insufficient evidence?

06:17.812 --> 06:20.162
Good cases, too,
as far as I can tell.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.207
Take this case.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.776
If you win,
half the quadrant will know it.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.952
And it'll bring your
other cases more attention.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.693
Maybe the attention
that they deserve.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.869
Are you attempting
to bribe me, Mr. Pike?

06:31.913 --> 06:33.957
I'm trying to convince you.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.527
I'm trying to save
an old friend.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.528
And maybe do some good here.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.356
Are you?
Or are you gonna

06:40.400 --> 06:41.662
let whatever happened
between you and Una

06:41.705 --> 06:43.707
get in the way
of your life's work?

06:44.926 --> 06:47.450
Just take a look
at the case file.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.496
You?
[scoffs]

06:49.539 --> 06:51.541
I doubt you'd even
break a sweat.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.501
You're a piece of work, Pike.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.677
Yeah.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.374
But you still haven't said no.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.646
UNA:
Neera!

07:09.690 --> 07:12.040
I had to see it for myself.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.608
I said this would happen.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.740
After 25 years,
the first thing you say to me

07:16.784 --> 07:17.828
is "I told you so"?

07:17.872 --> 07:20.352
I didn't think you'd...

07:20.396 --> 07:22.877
I'm not here for a reunion.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.661
Tell me the story of the story.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.358
Short version, your words.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.191
Until two months ago,
my record with Starfleet

07:33.235 --> 07:34.541
was spotless.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.716
When they didn't know,
they didn't care.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.152
The only thing that's changed

07:37.195 --> 07:39.110
is that they know the truth.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.112
And that you lied about it.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.289
Must be nice.

07:44.332 --> 07:45.769
What's that?

07:45.813 --> 07:48.511
It's just, some Illyrians
have modifications

07:48.555 --> 07:51.906
they can't hide,
and some of us refuse to.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.298
Neera, I should have...

07:53.342 --> 07:55.431
Please proceed, Commander.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.478
So then somebody turned me in,

07:58.521 --> 08:00.523
and now Starfleet
is asking me to hide again,

08:00.567 --> 08:02.351
so that no one has to know

08:02.394 --> 08:05.180
an Illyrian climbed the ranks
of Starfleet.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.922
It'll be like it never happened.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.533
-Like I never happened.
-So?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.579
You had your playtime,
acting like one of them.

08:12.622 --> 08:16.626
Accept your dismissal,
take your licks and go home.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.845
No.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.368
Why not?

08:19.411 --> 08:22.371
Because I shouldn't
have to hide anymore.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.807
None of us should.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.070
I know I should have
done better.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.332
I didn't stand up
when I should have.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.422
I'm standing up now.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.470
I'll tell opposing counsel
their deal is rejected.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.124
Thank you.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.561
Don't.
I'm not doing this for you,

08:38.605 --> 08:40.389
I'm doing this for me.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.434
And for all the Illyrians
who can't or just won't

08:43.479 --> 08:46.874
pretend to not be
who they really are...

08:46.917 --> 08:48.571
so they can run away
to Starfleet.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.319
Una rejected my deal.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.581
Good.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.759
Do you know how hard it was
to get that deal approved?

09:02.803 --> 09:03.891
I called in every favor.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.240
And do you think that was easy?

09:05.283 --> 09:06.676
Because I can tell you
it was not.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.634
Maybe you should have
thought about that

09:07.677 --> 09:08.809
before arresting her.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.419
[scoffs]
Don't be a child, Chris.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.073
I know you think I betrayed you.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.857
Una should be on my bridge
right now doing her job,

and my job-- ourjob...

09:19.036 --> 09:20.124
Oh, ourjob.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.604
...is to uphold it, regardless.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.563
Una broke the law.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.739
And what if the law is wrong?

09:30.657 --> 09:33.181
Chris, I didn't ask
to be put on this case.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.705
If you stop and look
for one second,

09:35.749 --> 09:37.446
you'll see I've done
everything in my power

09:37.489 --> 09:39.013
to help Una.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.232
That plea deal
was her best shot.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.930
And now that
she's turned it down,

09:42.973 --> 09:44.584
my boss,
the judge advocate general,

09:44.627 --> 09:45.889
is looking into the case.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.326
I don't know why,
but whatever the reason,

09:48.370 --> 09:50.024
it won't be good for Una.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.287
She should have taken the deal.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.641

10:26.843 --> 10:29.237
We would like to petition
the court to amend the charges

10:29.280 --> 10:31.282
against
Lieutenant Commander Chin-Riley.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.415
You may proceed, Captain Batel.

10:34.459 --> 10:37.114
BATEL:
For failure to disclose her
genetic modification status,

10:37.158 --> 10:39.726
we are charging Una Chin-Riley
with knowingly submitting

10:39.769 --> 10:41.815
false information to Starfleet

10:41.858 --> 10:45.514
as well as violating
Starfleet code 614 to 617

10:45.557 --> 10:47.690
prohibiting Starfleet officers
from engaging in

10:47.734 --> 10:49.126
permanent bioengineering,

10:49.170 --> 10:51.563
and two counts of sedition.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.743
We're seeking dishonorable
dismissal and 20 years

10:56.786 --> 10:58.483
in a Federation penal colony.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.755
PIKE:
Space.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.323
The final frontier.

11:14.151 --> 11:17.677
These are the voyages
of the starshipEnterprise.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.724
Its five-year mission:

11:21.768 --> 11:24.771
to explore strange new worlds..

11:26.947 --> 11:29.471
...to seek out new life

11:29.514 --> 11:33.083
and new civilizations,

11:33.127 --> 11:37.218
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.396
♪

12:11.731 --> 12:13.994
♪

12:43.763 --> 12:45.765
♪

12:54.730 --> 12:56.993
Twenty years for lying
on an application?

12:57.037 --> 12:59.430
You decided to fight back and
not make this easy for them.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.476
-[sighs]
-They want to make
an example out of you.

13:01.519 --> 13:04.305
-What do we do?
-We fight.

13:05.828 --> 13:06.960
Who's first
on their witness list?

13:07.003 --> 13:09.658
Admiral Robert April.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.355
April sponsored my application
to the Academy.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.140
I served under him for years
and he promoted me.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.706
-This is good for us, no?
-No.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.317
Pasalk wouldn't bring
a friendly witness

13:16.360 --> 13:17.622
without a strategy.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.624
Put me on the stand.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.322
Let them see that
being an Illyrian

13:21.365 --> 13:23.498
doesn't change
who I am as an officer.

13:23.541 --> 13:26.980
Are you being funny?
You were never funny.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.851
I know it's normally
not a good idea,

13:28.895 --> 13:31.071
but shouldn't they see me,
a successful Starfleet officer?

13:31.114 --> 13:32.463
It's a good story.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.423
Your story doesn't matter
to their case.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.425
You broke the law.
I put you up there,

13:37.468 --> 13:39.470
they'll just use you
to corroborate their facts.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.472
Or worse, to tear you down,
or likely bring down

13:41.516 --> 13:43.257
a bunch of your
so-called friends with you.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.870
Do you care about my story?

13:47.914 --> 13:51.047
I care that my client

13:51.091 --> 13:53.702
not hand the prosecution
the case.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.706
My way this time, Una.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.972
Your way.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.544
The captain suggested
you could set up shop here.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.549
I bet he did.

14:14.592 --> 14:17.030
Well, she's not using it.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.906
I'll need access
to the Starfleet

14:23.950 --> 14:25.995
Uniform Code of Justice.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.606
I assume
it's in your database.

14:28.650 --> 14:31.348
Also, Una's service records.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.179
Thank you,
Lieutenant Noonien-Singh.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.882
Is there something else?

14:42.925 --> 14:44.971
I think I might be of some
assistance to the case.

14:45.014 --> 14:48.713
Counselor, are you familiar
with Starfleet v. Wyck?

14:48.757 --> 14:51.412
I am a civil rights lawyer.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.544
Yes, of course.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.808
If I understand the principle
behind the ruling, then...

14:56.852 --> 14:59.986
Starfleet v. Wyck
is used as an example of

15:00.029 --> 15:02.075
"fruit of the poisonous tree."

15:02.118 --> 15:04.947
If evidence is procured
through illegal means,

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
it's inadmissible in court.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.951
You think some of the evidence
against Una

15:08.995 --> 15:10.387
was illegally obtained?

15:10.431 --> 15:11.867
If it was, could you get
her case thrown out

15:11.911 --> 15:13.129
on a technicality?

15:13.173 --> 15:15.436
If the evidence was rotten,

15:15.479 --> 15:18.265
I might be able
to get her case dismissed.

15:18.308 --> 15:21.050
Lieutenant, is there something
you know that I should know?

15:21.094 --> 15:23.835
Just let me cover
all the bases first.

15:23.879 --> 15:27.230
Well, you know where I'll be.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.583
[door whooshes open]

15:38.894 --> 15:40.374
May I?

15:41.897 --> 15:43.420
Fraternizing with the enemy?

15:43.464 --> 15:45.814
I'll take my chances.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.164
You look awful.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.165
Thanks for that.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.951
Does this have something to do
with the fact that

15:51.994 --> 15:53.517
your name wasn't on the witness
list for the defense?

15:53.561 --> 15:55.215
I know what you're gonna say.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.607
Putting me on the witness stand
is a terrible idea.

15:56.651 --> 15:59.001
But you want to fight
for your friend.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.785
And I can handle it.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.310
I've served with Una longer than
anyone else on this crew.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.703
I'm in the best position
to speak to her character.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.140
When did you two meet?

16:07.183 --> 16:10.491
Uh, I gave a speech
to her Academy class

16:10.534 --> 16:12.014
forever ago.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.364
[chuckles] That must have
been awful for you.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.627
I know how you hate to give
long, inspiring speeches.

16:18.194 --> 16:21.371
I was speaking about
a test mission I'd flown.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.245
Una came up to me afterward
and, uh, pointed out

16:25.288 --> 16:27.943
-a mistake I'd made
during reentry.
-Bold.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.989
And annoying.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.034
But she was right.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.906
She had the guts to tell me.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.039
April once told me that
every good captain needs

16:37.083 --> 16:39.128
a first officer who will
tell him when he's wrong.

16:39.172 --> 16:42.523
Yeah, he said that
to me once, too.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.570
And when did you first learn
that she was Illyrian,

16:46.614 --> 16:49.965
Captain Pike?

16:50.009 --> 16:54.317
I ask again.
How long were you aware

16:54.361 --> 16:56.537
that you were harboring
an Illyrian on your ship,

16:56.580 --> 16:58.104
Captain?

16:58.147 --> 17:00.323
I will remind you
you are on the stand,

17:00.367 --> 17:02.630
and under oath you do not have
the option of not answering.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.806
All right,
you've made your point.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.547
I know you want
to help Una, Chris,

17:06.589 --> 17:08.330
but if you take that stand,
this whole case

17:08.375 --> 17:09.680
becomes about you.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.551
You are the captain
of this ship.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.423
You knew Una was an Illyrian,
and you didn't tell Starfleet.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.077
You could be charged
with conspiracy,

17:15.121 --> 17:17.645
and your whole crew
could be at risk.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.560
No inspiring speeches today.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.606
Today, if you
want to help Una,

17:22.650 --> 17:25.087
the best thing you can do
is leave the talking to others.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.221
ORTEGAS:
"Mr. Spock,

17:28.263 --> 17:30.919
"I do hope you understand
why I have to

17:30.962 --> 17:32.660
"throw your friend in jail

17:32.703 --> 17:34.923
simply for being who she is."

17:34.966 --> 17:37.491
"Of course, Mr. Pasalk.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.102
"It is only logical.

17:40.146 --> 17:43.236
Shall we play a round
of Kal-toh this weekend?"

17:43.279 --> 17:46.761
"Yes. That would be enjoyable."

17:46.804 --> 17:48.241
[snores]

17:49.285 --> 17:50.634
You don't see the tension there?

17:51.635 --> 17:53.289
What tension?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.552
They're all, like, buddy-buddy.

17:55.596 --> 17:58.164
Vulcan bros.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.904
M'BENGA:
Vulcans may not give much,

17:59.948 --> 18:01.689
but you can
read their body language.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.039
And those two...

18:05.432 --> 18:06.824
...hate each other.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.831
Are you messing with me
right now?

18:16.573 --> 18:18.662
[clears throat]

18:24.059 --> 18:27.541
I regret that you had to
witness that outburst.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.066
We won't say a word.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.546
-Mm-mmm.
-Thank you, Doctor.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.635
Of all of my father's
former colleagues,

18:34.678 --> 18:38.247
Pasalk truly brings out
the worst in me.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.907
[both chuckling]

18:45.950 --> 18:47.909
Ensign Uhura.

18:47.952 --> 18:51.217
I need any communications
referencing Commander Chin-Riley

18:51.260 --> 18:52.870
for the last six months.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.177
Okay. I'll collate.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.746
Including all personal logs,
ship-wide.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.926
Sir, with respect,

19:04.969 --> 19:08.582
per Regulation 25, Section B,
all personal logs remain sealed

19:08.625 --> 19:10.758
unless by order
of Starfleet Command.

19:10.801 --> 19:13.064
-Sufficient evidence...
-I know the rules, Ensign.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.544
I'm giving you an order.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.981
You're doing this to help Una.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.201
Right?
She's your friend,

19:19.245 --> 19:21.551
your mentor.
I understand.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.684
But you are mine.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.556
And giving me
an illegal order will just

19:26.600 --> 19:28.254
get you in trouble
if I follow it.

19:28.297 --> 19:31.605
I don't think the commander
would want that for you.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.302
Neither do I.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.392
We need to find out
who turned her in.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.568
It might well be
the only way to save her.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.570
Then, respectfully,

19:40.614 --> 19:43.094
we're going to have to
find out another way.

19:43.138 --> 19:46.794
-Nyota...
-I'm sorry. No.

19:59.110 --> 20:02.026
[ringing]

20:03.376 --> 20:05.073
JAVAS:
This court is now in session.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.336
Joining me as judges
in this tribunal

20:07.380 --> 20:10.687
are Space Command
Representative Zus Tlaggul and

20:10.731 --> 20:12.907
Starfleet Commander Chiv.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.562
Commander Chin-Riley,
do you consent

20:15.605 --> 20:17.085
to Captain Batel

20:17.128 --> 20:18.869
as the prosecuting officer?

20:18.913 --> 20:20.262
I do.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.786
Let the charges be read.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.226
COMPUTER:
Lieutenant commander
Una Chin-Riley

20:27.269 --> 20:29.184
has been formally charged
with violating

20:29.228 --> 20:33.057
Starfleet regulation 614-617,

20:33.101 --> 20:35.451
prohibiting permanent
DNA modification,

20:35.495 --> 20:38.411
as well as submitting false
information to Starfleet,

20:38.454 --> 20:40.935
and two counts of sedition.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.374
How do you plead, Commander?

20:46.636 --> 20:49.509
-Not guilty.
-[bell ringing]

20:55.123 --> 20:58.387
BATEL: The Federation's stance
on genetic engineering is clear.

20:58.431 --> 21:01.564
The practice is dangerous
and illegal.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.262
The reasons for this are many,

21:03.305 --> 21:05.699
but the outcome
of the Eugenics Wars on Earth

21:05.742 --> 21:07.788
speaks for itself.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.181
Tens of millions dead.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.054
Pushed to its limits,

21:13.097 --> 21:16.362
genetic engineering
is nothing short of playing God.

21:16.405 --> 21:20.322
By interfering with DNA
and removing genetic outliers,

21:20.366 --> 21:23.891
we endanger the very essence
of natural evolution.

21:36.077 --> 21:37.165
NEERA:
Captain Batel is right.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.080
Permanent genetic modification

21:39.123 --> 21:41.082
is illegal under Federation law.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.389
Slavery was once legal.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.087
Apartheid was legal.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.872
Discrimination against people
for how they worshipped,

21:48.916 --> 21:52.354
how they loved, their gender,
color of their skin--

21:52.398 --> 21:54.400
all legal at one time
or another.

21:54.443 --> 21:57.881
A law does not
make something just.

21:57.925 --> 22:01.668
I'm not saying the Federation
means to do harm.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.540
Their experience
with genetic modification--

22:04.584 --> 22:06.237
the Eugenics Wars--

22:06.281 --> 22:08.501
was horrific.

22:08.544 --> 22:12.983
The pain that Earth felt,
unimaginable.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.769
The Federation built
a utopia in its wake,

22:15.812 --> 22:18.075
and in an effort
to protect that utopia,

22:18.119 --> 22:20.948
they became blinded
by a centuries-old fear,

22:20.991 --> 22:24.081
so much so that they have,
perhaps unknowingly,

22:24.125 --> 22:26.562
become persecutors.

22:26.606 --> 22:29.130
My client is only here
because of who she is

22:29.173 --> 22:30.566
and because she felt she had

22:30.610 --> 22:32.568
no other choice
than to hide that fact.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.396
Just like the millions
before her

22:34.440 --> 22:36.355
who were forced to hide
how they worshipped,

22:36.398 --> 22:38.618
how they loved,
what they truly looked like,

22:38.661 --> 22:40.359
because it made others

22:40.402 --> 22:42.099
uncomfortable.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.493
Because it made others afraid.

22:44.537 --> 22:47.931
If a law is not just,
then I ask

22:47.975 --> 22:51.413
how are we to trust those
who created that law

22:51.457 --> 22:53.763
to serve justice?

22:53.807 --> 22:57.419
BATEL:
The prosecution calls Admiral
Robert April to the stand.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.813
Admiral April, Una Chin-Riley
served under your command

22:59.856 --> 23:01.684
when you were captain of
the USSEnterprise, correct?

23:01.728 --> 23:03.207
Yes.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.035
But before that,
you sponsored her application

23:05.079 --> 23:06.559
-to Starfleet Academy.
-I did.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.908
So would it be fair to say

23:07.951 --> 23:11.781
you have an investment
in Una's career?

23:11.825 --> 23:14.131
It would.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.916
Admiral, I have to ask,

23:15.959 --> 23:18.527
at any point, did
Lieutenant Commander Chin-Riley

23:18.571 --> 23:21.530
disclose to you that
she was genetically modified?

23:21.574 --> 23:23.532
-No.
-If you had known she was
genetically modified,

23:23.576 --> 23:25.578
would you have sponsored
her application

23:25.621 --> 23:27.449
to Starfleet Academy?

23:27.493 --> 23:29.451
Una is an extremely
talented officer,

23:29.495 --> 23:32.585
and one of the most gifted
applicants I'd ever met.

23:32.628 --> 23:33.716
That is not the question, sir.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.722
If you had known Una Chin-Riley
was genetically modified,

23:39.766 --> 23:41.245
would you have sponsored
her application

23:41.289 --> 23:43.160
to Starfleet Academy?

23:43.204 --> 23:45.336
You're under oath, sir.

23:46.990 --> 23:49.297
No, I would not.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.520
BATEL:
Thank you, Admiral.

23:54.563 --> 23:58.828
It takes a big man
to admit his mistakes.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.830
I admire that, Admiral.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.964
Just for the record,
could you tell the court why

24:04.007 --> 24:06.270
you would not have sponsored
Commander Chin-Riley's

24:06.314 --> 24:08.447
Starfleet application,
specifically?

24:08.490 --> 24:11.537
Starfleet Regulation 17,
Article 12

24:11.580 --> 24:14.844
explicitly prohibits
genetically modified people,

24:14.888 --> 24:17.368
-such as Illyrians,
from serving.
-NEERA: Of course.

24:17.412 --> 24:21.198
You are an honorable,
decorated admiral.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.636
You wouldn't want
to break protocol

24:23.679 --> 24:25.507
for any one
individual applicant.

24:25.551 --> 24:28.554
-Let me stress
this is not personal.
-Right.

24:28.597 --> 24:29.946
It's the law.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.470
Admiral April,

24:31.513 --> 24:35.474
can you tell me what
General Order One is?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.476
Objection. Relevance?

24:37.519 --> 24:40.870
I'm curious myself.
Tread carefully, Counselor.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.090
I will, Your Honor.
Admiral,

24:43.133 --> 24:45.571
what is General Order One?

24:45.614 --> 24:48.748
No starship may interfere
with the normal development of

24:48.791 --> 24:51.838
-any alien life or society.
-NEERA: Yes.

24:51.881 --> 24:53.448
A very important law.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.711
So much so that you now
refer to it as

24:55.755 --> 24:57.234
the Prime Directive,

24:57.278 --> 24:59.759
-do you not?
-Yes, that is correct.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.370
NEERA:
In 2246, while in command
of theEnterprise,

25:02.413 --> 25:05.504
you chose to warn the Perricans,
a pre-warp civilization,

25:05.547 --> 25:07.636
about a possibly apocalyptic
meteor shower

25:07.680 --> 25:09.203
about to hit their planet.

25:09.246 --> 25:12.336
Were you then following
General Order One?

25:12.380 --> 25:14.817
-That was different.
-2248.

25:14.861 --> 25:17.951
You sent your science officer
to the industrial-age planet

25:17.994 --> 25:20.040
Na'rel to solve
the imminent threat

25:20.083 --> 25:21.650
of an extinction-level drought

25:21.694 --> 25:23.957
by sharing Federation
technology.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.308
-Were you in compliance then?
-BATEL: Objection.
Relevance again.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.179
An entire planet
would have died.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.834
And when you landed
on the hostile planet Man-us 2

25:31.878 --> 25:33.880
without your security officer,

25:33.923 --> 25:36.099
you chose to reveal
your starship

25:36.143 --> 25:38.188
to the pre-warp
civilization Ohawk.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.626
-Objection!
-Did you comply then, Admiral?

25:40.669 --> 25:42.366
JAVAS:
Counselor, I will remind you

25:42.410 --> 25:44.586
the witness
is not on trial here.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.894
Admiral, it would seem that
the rules of Starfleet

25:47.937 --> 25:50.984
only apply when a captain
deems that they do.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.206
Is there a question, Counselor?

25:56.250 --> 25:58.774
Yes.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.950
You have shown
that you have been

26:00.994 --> 26:03.039
repeatedly willing to break

26:03.083 --> 26:05.607
the very first order
of Starfleet

26:05.651 --> 26:07.566
and you are hailed as a hero.

26:07.609 --> 26:11.570
You can break the law
if you so choose. So, hiding

26:11.613 --> 26:13.833
behind order and protocol
to explain why you would

26:13.876 --> 26:16.183
not have admitted
Una Chin-Riley to Starfleet

26:16.226 --> 26:17.837
is a sanctimonious falsehood,
is it not?

26:17.880 --> 26:20.404
-Objection!
-JAVAS: Counselor!

26:20.448 --> 26:23.451
You will cease this line
of questioning at once.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.323
My client did not ask
to be genetically modified.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.761
It is an Illyrian
cultural practice

26:28.804 --> 26:31.067
done to children
before they are even born.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.373
It is done for survival,

26:32.416 --> 26:34.505
and yet she has been arrested

26:34.549 --> 26:36.377
because of a violation of a law.

26:36.420 --> 26:39.554
But the admiral has just shown
us that Starfleet regulations

26:39.598 --> 26:42.165
are flimsy
and subjective at best.

26:42.209 --> 26:45.821
Starfleet captains make
judgement calls every day.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.431
Calls that save lives.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.433
Una Chin-Riley's services
to Starfleet

26:49.477 --> 26:51.044
have been commendable, yes.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.481
But the law that she broke
is there to save lives

26:53.524 --> 26:55.483
and prevent genocide.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.790
So, if you ask me, Counselor,

26:57.833 --> 26:59.705
if I would have denied
Commander Chin-Riley's

26:59.748 --> 27:01.707
access to Starfleet Academy
had I known

27:01.750 --> 27:03.143
she was genetically modified,

27:03.186 --> 27:06.189
my answer is still yes,
I would have.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.716
So you admit that the reason
for your decision

27:10.759 --> 27:12.718
is not law, but fear
and racial prejudice.

27:12.761 --> 27:16.112
-BATEL: Objection!
-Sustained.
-Counselor Ketoul,

27:16.156 --> 27:18.462
this is a court martial
for Una Chin-Riley,

27:18.506 --> 27:19.942
not Admiral April.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.510
That you are unable
to defend your client

27:22.553 --> 27:23.990
does not permit you
to attack the Federation

27:24.033 --> 27:26.427
or our officers.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.299
All of the admiral's testimony
will be stricken

27:29.343 --> 27:31.127
from the court record.

27:33.956 --> 27:36.306
Did Una's lawyer just
try and indict Admiral April?

27:36.350 --> 27:37.786
It would appear so.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.309
I guess that's one strategy.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.355
That didn't exactly
make April look good.

27:41.398 --> 27:44.271
But how does
any of this help Una?

27:45.881 --> 27:47.883
Oh, boy.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.364
So, the lawyer was your idea.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.670
She was.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.803
She's one of the best
civil rights litigators

27:54.847 --> 27:57.240
in the galaxy, and Una's friend.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.201
You know,
I think highly of Una.

28:01.244 --> 28:04.900
Promoted her faster than
any other officer on my ship.

28:04.944 --> 28:07.163
Recommended her
for the Medal of Gallantry

28:07.207 --> 28:10.253
after the Marcel disaster
in 2248.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.255
Yeah, I know.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.388
It's a shame the rest
of the court didn't get a chance

28:14.431 --> 28:16.129
to hear that today.

28:20.176 --> 28:22.222
[door whooshes open]

28:24.311 --> 28:26.356
[door whooshes closed]

28:27.314 --> 28:29.490
[indistinct chatter in distance]

28:29.533 --> 28:32.319
What the hell was that?

28:32.362 --> 28:33.624
You're supposed to defend me,

28:33.668 --> 28:34.974
not attack Admiral April,

28:35.017 --> 28:37.977
-not indict the Federation.
-Why not?

28:38.020 --> 28:40.283
Why are you still
trying to protect them?

28:40.327 --> 28:42.546
I thought you said
you were ready for this fight.

28:42.590 --> 28:45.506
Do you know how rare it is
to get a platform like this?

28:45.549 --> 28:46.942
Platform?

28:46.986 --> 28:49.945
Most Illyrians
don't have your privilege.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.773
Has it occurred to you
that your case might bring us

28:51.817 --> 28:54.167
one step closer
in dismantling the law?

28:54.210 --> 28:57.910
Maybe in the future there can be
justice for Illyrians.

28:57.953 --> 28:59.520
I thought you knew that.

28:59.563 --> 29:02.392
All you ever wanted here
was a soapbox.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.003
This isn't about defending me.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.700
This is just a way for you
to broadcast your hatred

29:05.744 --> 29:07.397
of the Federation.

29:07.441 --> 29:10.836
I thought you were here
to help me, but you're not.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.751
As long as you can
make the Federation look bad,

29:12.794 --> 29:14.840
then who the hell cares if I get
left behind in the process?

29:14.883 --> 29:19.583
I think we both know you're not
the one who gets left behind.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.761
Neera...

29:22.804 --> 29:24.719
That's all in the past.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.199
We should talk about it.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.722
Please.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.159
I told you that I would try.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.901
And that's exactly
what I'm doing.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.903
Because at least with me,

29:34.947 --> 29:36.992
what you see is what you get.

29:39.429 --> 29:42.171
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.794
The defense calls to the stand

29:55.837 --> 29:58.535
three expert
character witnesses.

29:58.579 --> 29:59.972
La'An Noonien-Singh,

30:00.015 --> 30:02.191
security officer
for the USS Enterprise.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.193
I am the chief science officer.

30:04.237 --> 30:07.893
Chief medical officer
of the USS Enterprise.

30:07.936 --> 30:10.809
I graduated top of my class
and have been promoted

30:10.852 --> 30:12.549
each year during
my tenure in Starfleet.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.247
You were also in consideration

30:14.290 --> 30:16.466
-for the Starfleet
Medal of Gallantry.
-Yes.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.555
-So you've saved lives?
-Yes.

30:18.599 --> 30:21.167
When did you first meet
Una Chin-Riley?

30:21.210 --> 30:24.257
On my first day as an ensign
on the Enterprise.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.215
She was part of
the rescue mission

30:26.259 --> 30:29.610
that found me after I escaped
from a Gorn breeding planet.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.655
You have a very unique
last name.

30:31.699 --> 30:35.268
-Do you have any relation
to Khan Noonien Singh?
-Yes.

30:35.311 --> 30:37.400
Did you ever suspect Una
to be an Illyrian?

30:37.444 --> 30:39.489
No, I did not.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.974
Did you ever get the sense
that Commander Chin-Riley

30:46.018 --> 30:48.890
was hiding something?

30:48.934 --> 30:50.587
Never.

30:54.548 --> 30:57.507
Just that she was discreet
and empathetic

30:57.551 --> 31:00.946
and handled personal matters
with great care.

31:00.989 --> 31:05.211
Yes, I did get the sense
that she was hiding something.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.300
NEERA:
What was she hiding?

31:11.957 --> 31:16.135
An affinity for
Gilbert and Sullivan musicals.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.707
After the defendant rescued you,
did you remain close?

31:24.839 --> 31:27.146
I had no family left.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.365
Una made sure
I was taken care of.

31:29.409 --> 31:32.716
She sponsored my application
to Starfleet.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.805
Would it be fair to say that

31:34.849 --> 31:36.851
you would not have
joined Starfleet

31:36.895 --> 31:40.159
if not for Commander Chin-Riley?

31:40.202 --> 31:43.727
Counselor, I wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for Una.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.991
NEERA:
And the people you saved
during your career,

31:46.034 --> 31:47.906
would they be alive?

31:48.950 --> 31:51.735
No, they would not.

31:53.824 --> 31:56.088
BATEL:
Mr. Spock, if the defendant
broke the law,

31:56.131 --> 31:58.090
would it follow that the
only logical course of action

31:58.133 --> 32:00.179
is for her to be
punished accordingly?

32:00.222 --> 32:03.138
Perhaps. Although
I think it is illogical

32:03.182 --> 32:04.792
for Starfleet to punish itself.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.576
I'm afraid I don't understand.

32:08.578 --> 32:09.797
The loss of Una
would be destructive

32:09.840 --> 32:11.190
to Starfleet as an organization.

32:12.843 --> 32:15.194
She is an extraordinary officer.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.242
Please describe the nature
of your relationship

32:20.286 --> 32:21.635
with the defendant.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.071
She is a mentor.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.681
I have learned a great deal
about leadership

32:24.725 --> 32:26.379
by serving under her.

32:26.422 --> 32:30.644
She puts the lives of her crew
above her own. Always.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.254
She is a friend.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.127
Family. Una is

32:35.170 --> 32:36.737
family.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.875
[door whooshes open]

32:48.270 --> 32:50.490
Thank you, Lieutenant.

32:50.533 --> 32:53.536
Volume 12.9
of the Starfleet Uniform

32:53.580 --> 32:55.234
Code of Justice.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.453
If you need anything else,
I will...

32:57.497 --> 32:59.194
Lieutenant, there is one more
thing. I was wondering,

32:59.238 --> 33:00.891
did you have any luck
finding out

33:00.935 --> 33:04.112
how the prosecution learned
that Una was Illyrian?

33:04.156 --> 33:06.680
No, not-not so far.

33:06.723 --> 33:09.857
But you have an idea
about it, don't you?

33:11.641 --> 33:13.643
You think it was you.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.082
Yes.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.084
Why is that?

33:19.127 --> 33:20.128
The night I found out

33:20.172 --> 33:22.826
Una was Illyrian, I was...

33:24.828 --> 33:26.439
...I was angry.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.397
I recorded a personal log.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.747
And you think that
somebody got ahold

33:30.791 --> 33:32.401
of that personal log,

33:32.445 --> 33:34.708
and that's how Una was exposed.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.492
-Yes.
-Interesting.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.712
May I ask why you were angry?

33:38.755 --> 33:42.629
It can't be because
Una was genetically augmented.

33:42.672 --> 33:45.153
Considering your last name,
I would think

33:45.197 --> 33:46.763
you would understand the nuances

33:46.807 --> 33:48.548
of genetic manipulation
better than most.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.464
Una was my friend.
She lied to me.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.596
It's not that simple, is it?

33:54.597 --> 33:56.686
-No.
-Could it be

33:56.730 --> 34:00.255
that you carry
your family's augmentations,

34:00.299 --> 34:03.171
and you believe that
because of them

34:03.215 --> 34:05.304
you may become dangerous?

34:06.696 --> 34:08.655
Yes, I do.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.443
There is nothing
wrong with you, Lieutenant.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.318
No hidden monster inside.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.667
-You don't know that.
-But I do.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.060
It's how they make us feel.

34:23.277 --> 34:25.324
They look down at us
for so long that

34:25.367 --> 34:27.369
we begin to look down
at ourselves.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.632
Genetics is not destiny,

34:30.677 --> 34:33.592
despite what you
may have been taught.

34:33.636 --> 34:36.465
The fear you have of yourself,
it's not your own.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.511
It was drilled into you.

34:38.554 --> 34:41.514
You're not born a monster.

34:41.556 --> 34:44.386
You were just born with
a capacity for actions,

34:44.429 --> 34:46.909
good or ill.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.695
Just like the rest of us.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.351
In any case...

34:54.396 --> 34:57.356
...it takes six months
at a minimum

34:57.399 --> 34:58.792
after a request

34:58.835 --> 35:01.273
from a boatload of admirals

35:01.316 --> 35:03.840
to subpoena a personal log.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.495
They haven't had
nearly that long.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.410
I guarantee,
you are not the person

35:08.454 --> 35:11.152
who leaked Una's true identity
to Starfleet.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.379
But if it wasn't my log
that caused this, then

35:20.422 --> 35:22.511
who turned in Una?

35:22.555 --> 35:24.905
You're head of security here.

35:24.948 --> 35:27.342
Una speaks highly of you,

35:27.386 --> 35:30.476
which is not something
she does of many people.

35:30.519 --> 35:32.956
Who do you think did it?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.350
I-I d...
I don't know.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.659
Someone who could gain
from exposing the truth.

35:39.702 --> 35:41.748
My thoughts exactly.

35:43.402 --> 35:47.057
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

35:48.624 --> 35:51.236
Why do I feel like I've just
been hit by a shuttle?

35:51.279 --> 35:53.325
I'll take that as a compliment.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.945
I would like to call
the defendant

36:04.988 --> 36:07.165
Una Chin-Riley to the stand.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.131
How long have you
been in Starfleet?

36:17.175 --> 36:18.959
Twenty-five years.

36:19.002 --> 36:22.876
Would you call this career
your life's goal?

36:22.919 --> 36:24.704
It's all I've ever wanted.

36:24.747 --> 36:28.186
You knew you were Illyrian,
thus genetically modified.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.144
Didn't you think
you might find yourself

36:30.188 --> 36:32.233
in this position one day?

36:32.277 --> 36:34.583
I had been warned, yes.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.237
So why join Starfleet?

36:38.108 --> 36:41.199
Ad astra per aspera.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.026
Could you translate
for the court?

36:45.899 --> 36:49.250
"To the stars through hardship."

36:49.294 --> 36:52.601
It was the Starfleet motto
before the Federation.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.690
I learned it studying
history in school.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.563
Why were you drawn
to that motto?

36:57.606 --> 37:00.609
I knew it meant
we must endure hardship

37:00.653 --> 37:02.263
to get to the stars.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.265
But I like to think
that it also means

37:04.309 --> 37:06.398
that the stars could deliver us

37:06.441 --> 37:08.835
from anything.
That

37:08.878 --> 37:11.925
in the mystery
an vastness of space,

37:11.968 --> 37:14.580
we might not just
satisfy our curiosity,

37:14.623 --> 37:17.147
our need for exploration,

37:17.191 --> 37:21.500
but that in it,
we might each also find...

37:21.543 --> 37:23.589
salvation.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.635
Why would you need salvation?

37:28.594 --> 37:30.683
Was your childhood difficult?

37:32.075 --> 37:34.295
Objection. The defendant's
childhood isn't relevant here.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.211
NEERA:
I'm simply establishing context.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.475
If Una Chin-Riley is to be tried
for being an Illyrian,

37:40.519 --> 37:44.392
then the court must understand
what it means to be an Illyrian.

37:44.436 --> 37:47.177
We'll allow it
to continue, Counselor.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.527
NEERA:
Thank you.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.659
You grew up
in a Federation colony

37:50.703 --> 37:53.053
in the Vaultera Nebula,
correct?

37:53.096 --> 37:55.577
Yes. We were given
provisional membership

37:55.621 --> 37:58.319
in the Federation
the year before I was born.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.669
On the condition that
all genetic modification

38:00.713 --> 38:02.671
was to cease.
Is that correct?

38:02.715 --> 38:05.892
-Yes.
-But that didn't happen,
did it?

38:08.068 --> 38:10.723
It did for some.

38:10.766 --> 38:14.117
But for other families,
like mine,

38:14.161 --> 38:17.120
it was our tradition.

38:17.164 --> 38:19.166
Our heritage.

38:19.209 --> 38:21.908
What was life like
for your family

38:21.951 --> 38:23.953
under the Federation?

38:23.997 --> 38:26.086
♪

38:26.129 --> 38:28.175
UNA:
We no longer
discussed our customs.

38:28.218 --> 38:31.352
We performed our rituals
only in secret.

38:31.396 --> 38:34.268
Those who could
hid their modifications.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.358
When new children
were born, parents

38:37.402 --> 38:40.056
sought out friendly doctors
to deliver them.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.364
We knew if we were
ever found to be

38:43.408 --> 38:45.714
genetically augmented
we would be arrested.

38:45.758 --> 38:48.456
Did that ever happen
to anyone you knew?

38:48.500 --> 38:51.198
A boy I went to school with.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.069
Ivan Ketoul.

38:53.113 --> 38:55.594
He was my best friend's cousin.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.639
What happened to him?

38:57.683 --> 39:00.033
UNA:
Some of us have immune systems
that can glow.

39:00.076 --> 39:04.472
Someone must have seen him.
He came home one day

39:04.516 --> 39:07.388
to find the word "augment"
on their door. We had just

39:07.432 --> 39:09.390
learned about
augments in school.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.350
Opinions on them were clear.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.484
Someone must have found out.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.312
Maybe it was just a prank.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.314
Did anyone defend him,

39:20.358 --> 39:21.663
his family?

39:22.664 --> 39:24.492
Some.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.364
But there weren't enough voices.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.759
Ivan and his parents
were arrested in their home.

39:30.803 --> 39:32.370
He was ten years old.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.375
How did this affect
your community?

39:37.418 --> 39:39.420
Some families
moved to other planets

39:39.464 --> 39:41.422
that weren't Federation.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.685
And those of us who stayed,

39:43.729 --> 39:46.471
we were persecuted.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.692
Circumstances became extreme.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.262
The anti-augmentation laws
seemed to give people

39:55.305 --> 39:58.657
freedom to act on
their worst impulses.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.138
First were the insults.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.097
"Augment."

40:04.140 --> 40:06.229
"Moddie."

40:06.273 --> 40:08.231
"Freak."

40:08.275 --> 40:10.451
There were stores
that wouldn't serve you

40:10.495 --> 40:12.235
if they'd heard
you'd been modified.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.152
Even the rumors
could be dangerous.

40:16.196 --> 40:19.242
I remember when
the attacks began.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.506
We feared for our lives.

40:23.029 --> 40:24.465
Go on.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.554
There was a fight
at school one day.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.732
One boy accused another boy
of being an Illyrian.

40:32.342 --> 40:33.779
I tried to stop it.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.955
My leg got broken.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.000
It was such a simple fix.

40:39.262 --> 40:41.308
So easy to treat
with modern medicine.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.529
But my parents wouldn't
take me to a hospital.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.922
They were afraid.

40:46.966 --> 40:50.883
Despite my modifications,
my leg became infected.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.147
If we hadn't found
and Illyrian doctor

40:54.190 --> 40:55.670
willing to see me
in the middle of the night,

40:55.714 --> 40:57.237
I would have died.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.898
I'm so sorry.

41:05.941 --> 41:08.509
Was this normal for

41:08.553 --> 41:11.860
such a common thing
to become life-threatening?

41:11.904 --> 41:13.862
It was for kids like me, yes.

41:13.906 --> 41:16.343
Civil unrest became so great

41:16.386 --> 41:19.781
the local government decided
to divide us into two cities:

41:19.825 --> 41:22.262
Illyrian and non-Illyrian.

41:23.263 --> 41:24.656
Thank you.

41:26.614 --> 41:29.574
My family, we went
to the non-Illyrian city.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.491
You see, some of us could pass.

41:35.884 --> 41:37.843
We could blend in,

41:37.886 --> 41:39.671
so we did.

41:40.715 --> 41:44.327
We left everyone else behind.
Our families.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.331
Our friends.

41:48.375 --> 41:50.420
We left them all.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.423
I regret it to this day.

41:55.121 --> 41:57.079
I'm so sorry.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.342
And yet,

41:59.386 --> 42:02.650
after all of this strife,

42:02.694 --> 42:05.523
you still wanted
to be a Starfleet officer.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.568
Yes.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.962
One last question, Commander.

42:11.703 --> 42:14.532
How did Starfleet find out
that you were Illyrian?

42:15.576 --> 42:18.448
You managed to keep your status
a secret for so many years,

42:18.492 --> 42:20.363
it's surprising
they found out now.

42:20.407 --> 42:23.845
-I don't...
-Who turned you in to Starfleet?

42:23.889 --> 42:25.586
I remind you,
you are under oath.

42:25.630 --> 42:28.154
I caution you against
badgering your own witness.

42:28.197 --> 42:30.025
-Who turned you in?
-JAVAS: Counselor!

42:30.069 --> 42:31.113
I did.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.901
I turned myself in.

42:42.081 --> 42:43.169
NEERA:
Why?

42:44.213 --> 42:46.433
Why would you risk your career,

42:46.476 --> 42:49.044
the life you built?

42:49.088 --> 42:52.526
I was so sick of living a lie,

42:52.570 --> 42:55.311
of pretending
to be someone I wasn't.

42:56.486 --> 42:58.010
I wanted my crew...

42:59.446 --> 43:02.971
I wanted my crew to know me
for who I really was.

43:03.015 --> 43:06.801
I thought maybe if they did,
I would finally be safe.

43:09.238 --> 43:13.199
And Starfleet would finally
understand Illyrian's better.

43:13.242 --> 43:15.593
So, after all of it...

43:17.159 --> 43:19.771
...you still wanted Starfleet
to accept you.

43:19.814 --> 43:21.250
Why?

43:21.294 --> 43:23.078
When I was five or six,

43:23.122 --> 43:25.864
I remember
a Starfleet crew visited.

43:27.779 --> 43:30.651
They were all so...

43:30.695 --> 43:33.088
different from one another.

43:33.132 --> 43:36.135
So many crew members
from so many planets.

43:36.178 --> 43:39.704
It was beautiful.
I thought

43:39.747 --> 43:43.490
if all those people
from all those worlds

43:43.533 --> 43:47.015
can work together, side by side,

43:47.059 --> 43:49.583
maybe I could, too.

43:49.627 --> 43:53.631
Maybe I could be a part
of something bigger than myself.

43:53.674 --> 43:57.112
Starfleet is not
a perfect organization,

43:57.156 --> 43:59.288
but it strives to be.

43:59.332 --> 44:02.378
And I believe it could be.

44:03.379 --> 44:06.687
You're saying that...

44:06.731 --> 44:09.908
is why you turned yourself in?

44:09.951 --> 44:11.431
Yes.

44:11.474 --> 44:14.956
Because you believe
in Starfleet.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.045
Yes.

44:18.743 --> 44:21.615
Ad astra per aspera.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.969
Thank you, Commander.

44:28.013 --> 44:30.972
No further questions.

44:42.854 --> 44:45.421
That was a very emotional story.

44:46.858 --> 44:49.774
However, emotions
are irrelevant.

44:49.817 --> 44:51.950
Facts are not.

44:51.993 --> 44:55.040
On what date
did Captain Christopher Pike

44:55.083 --> 44:56.911
learn the truth about your

44:56.955 --> 44:58.870
genetically modified status?

44:58.913 --> 45:00.785
NEERA:
Objection.

45:00.828 --> 45:03.222
This trial is about
Una Chin-Riley,

45:03.265 --> 45:04.658
not her captain.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.660
What we have here
is not just one officer's

45:06.704 --> 45:08.662
violation of the law.

45:08.706 --> 45:11.056
This incident is evidence of
breakdown of chain of command

45:11.099 --> 45:12.753
on board the starship
Enterprise,

45:12.797 --> 45:15.756
starting with its captain.

45:15.800 --> 45:18.672
If Captain Pike was aware
of Una Chin-Riley's fraud

45:18.716 --> 45:22.545
prior to her arrest,
and did not notify Starfleet,

45:22.589 --> 45:24.809
then what we have here
is not fraud,

45:24.852 --> 45:26.680
but conspiracy.

45:27.812 --> 45:30.989
Since my co-counsel
neglected to elicit testimony

45:31.032 --> 45:32.642
from the parties involved,

45:32.686 --> 45:34.906
I will ask the commander
directly.

45:36.690 --> 45:40.650
When did Captain Pike
become aware of your status?

45:48.180 --> 45:50.138
I will also remind the commander

45:50.182 --> 45:52.358
that she is under oath.

45:52.401 --> 45:54.490
And I reminder her that

45:54.534 --> 45:56.884
she does not want
to perjure herself

45:56.928 --> 45:59.191
as I ask one more time,

45:59.234 --> 46:02.020
when did Christopher Pike
first learn

46:02.063 --> 46:04.239
that you were an Illyrian?

46:11.551 --> 46:13.901
Stardate 1224.3

46:17.426 --> 46:18.863
PASALK:
Four months.

46:18.906 --> 46:22.214
Well before your arrest.

46:22.257 --> 46:24.433
For four months,

46:24.477 --> 46:26.348
the captain of the Enterprise

46:26.392 --> 46:28.524
engaged in a conspiracy

46:28.568 --> 46:31.266
to conceal the Illyrian
Una Chin-Riley.

46:33.399 --> 46:35.314
I have no further questions.

46:49.067 --> 46:50.546
PASALK:
The defense wants you
to ignore the facts

46:50.590 --> 46:52.200
in favor of emotion.

46:52.244 --> 46:55.769
But the only matter
of import today is the law.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.771
Una Chin-Riley

46:57.815 --> 46:59.904
broke the law and lied about it,

46:59.947 --> 47:03.124
as her own testimony has proven.
Further,

47:03.168 --> 47:05.779
her actions will likely
lead to a court martial of

47:05.823 --> 47:08.434
one of Starfleet's
most decorated officers.

47:08.477 --> 47:11.045
She is clearly toxic
to Starfleet

47:11.089 --> 47:14.179
in both action an inaction.

47:14.222 --> 47:16.268
Therefore, the only
logical response

47:16.311 --> 47:20.315
is to find the defendant
guilty of all charges.

47:27.845 --> 47:31.239
Captain Batel,
are you familiar with

47:31.283 --> 47:35.765
the Starfleet Code 8514?

47:35.809 --> 47:37.332
I am.

47:37.376 --> 47:39.595
Would you mind reading that code
for the court?

47:44.035 --> 47:46.254
BATEL:
"In extraordinary
and extreme circumstances,

47:46.298 --> 47:48.430
"if the following
conditions are met:

47:48.474 --> 47:52.304
"1.] any person
fleeing persecution...

47:52.347 --> 47:54.132
We were persecuted.

47:54.175 --> 47:56.090
I remember when
the attacks began.

47:56.134 --> 47:59.528
"...or fearing for their life
due to political

47:59.572 --> 48:00.834
"or religious beliefs,

48:00.878 --> 48:02.444
"cultural engagements or

48:02.488 --> 48:04.403
"biological truths may,

48:04.446 --> 48:08.189
"2.] seek safety
within Starfleet...

48:08.233 --> 48:10.931
I thought maybe if they did,
I would finally be safe.

48:10.975 --> 48:12.237
We feared for our lives.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.891
"and 3.]

48:13.934 --> 48:16.284
"upon revealing themselves
to authorities

48:16.328 --> 48:17.633
"and making a request,

48:17.677 --> 48:19.113
"may be granted asylum.

48:20.201 --> 48:21.855
I turned myself in.

48:21.899 --> 48:24.597
I wanted my crew to know me
for who I really was.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.165
BATEL:
"Starfleet captains
must exercise discretion

48:27.208 --> 48:30.081
"in judgement
when offering asylum.

48:30.124 --> 48:32.300
"Status is confirmed
by a Starfleet tribunal

48:32.344 --> 48:34.389
or designated authority."

48:37.740 --> 48:41.396
Fearing for their life.

48:41.440 --> 48:44.965
One may seek safety
within Starfleet

48:45.009 --> 48:48.142
and request asylum.

48:49.752 --> 48:52.320
Starfleet has a long tradition

48:52.364 --> 48:55.019
of performing rescue missions.

48:55.062 --> 48:57.108
How many distressed peoples

48:57.151 --> 48:59.327
has Starfleet aided?

48:59.371 --> 49:01.721
How many lives saved?

49:03.070 --> 49:04.942
Una Chin-Riley knew this.

49:04.985 --> 49:07.901
She believed in the best
of Starfleet,

49:07.945 --> 49:10.208
and that through it
she could find salvation

49:10.251 --> 49:14.908
from the hardships and danger
of her everyday life.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.954
Danger she faced

49:16.997 --> 49:20.044
just for being born an Illyrian.

49:20.087 --> 49:23.699
Dangers born of prejudice,

49:23.743 --> 49:27.442
spurred on by laws
against people like her.

49:28.748 --> 49:31.011
But through her hardships,

49:31.055 --> 49:33.622
Una saw the stars.

49:33.666 --> 49:36.190
She joined Starfleet
because she believed

49:36.234 --> 49:38.453
it was the only thing

49:38.497 --> 49:40.673
that could save her life.

49:40.716 --> 49:44.372
She fled persecution,
and within Starfleet

49:44.416 --> 49:46.548
she sought safety.

49:46.592 --> 49:48.986
And then, by turning herself in,

49:49.029 --> 49:51.162
Una fulfilled the third

49:51.205 --> 49:53.642
and final requirement
for asylum.

49:58.038 --> 50:00.823
She asked for it

50:00.867 --> 50:04.305
and Captain Pike granted it.

50:04.349 --> 50:07.308
Like all good
Starfleet captains,

50:07.352 --> 50:10.442
including Admiral April
on Perrican,

50:10.485 --> 50:13.053
Na'rel and Man-us 2,

50:13.097 --> 50:15.882
he exercised his judgement

50:15.925 --> 50:18.493
and gave her asylum.

50:20.452 --> 50:23.455
All this tribunal
needs to do now...

50:25.283 --> 50:29.287
...is confirm that status
to absolve them both.

50:35.684 --> 50:38.339
Do you know why I love the law?

50:38.383 --> 50:42.039
Because a law is not

50:42.082 --> 50:44.737
a mirror to society.

50:44.780 --> 50:48.001
A law is an ideal.

50:48.045 --> 50:51.222
A beacon to remind us

50:51.265 --> 50:53.920
how to be our better selves.

50:53.963 --> 50:57.184
And you have
the opportunity today

50:57.228 --> 51:00.361
to do just that.

51:01.580 --> 51:04.583
Mr. Pasalk has made this case
about the law,

51:04.626 --> 51:06.106
and I agree, it is.

51:06.150 --> 51:09.849
By his own argument,
we cannot ignore that

51:09.892 --> 51:13.374
Code 8514 is also law.

51:13.418 --> 51:16.638
All I am asking you

51:16.682 --> 51:19.728
to do today

51:19.772 --> 51:22.296
is to be your better selves

51:22.340 --> 51:24.777
and enforce the law

51:24.820 --> 51:26.431
that favors my client

51:26.474 --> 51:28.346
with the same dispassion

51:28.389 --> 51:31.218
as the laws
that would exclude her.

51:31.262 --> 51:33.307
Years ago...

51:36.441 --> 51:38.878
...the ideals of Starfleet

51:38.921 --> 51:41.141
called a young girl

51:41.185 --> 51:43.752
from the far side
of the galaxy to service.

51:46.320 --> 51:49.193
Find those ideals
inside yourself.

51:50.411 --> 51:52.326
Grant Una Chin-Riley

51:52.370 --> 51:55.938
the asylum she was
so clearly seeking.

52:05.687 --> 52:07.646
JAVAS:
I think we could all agree

52:07.689 --> 52:09.387
that the issue
of genetic engineering

52:09.430 --> 52:11.998
is a nuanced one.

52:12.041 --> 52:16.176
The laws prohibiting it
exist for very good reasons.

52:16.220 --> 52:18.526
And regulations must persist

52:18.570 --> 52:21.050
so we may not one day
face another crisis

52:21.094 --> 52:23.227
like the Eugenics Wars.

52:23.270 --> 52:25.794
But this court also believes

52:25.838 --> 52:29.537
that these reasons cannot
and do not allow us to treat

52:29.581 --> 52:34.281
every individual
augment, Illyrian,

52:34.325 --> 52:38.242
or other persons
with modified DNA the same.

52:38.285 --> 52:40.200
Lines must be drawn,

52:40.244 --> 52:43.334
but they must also shift
when necessary.

52:43.377 --> 52:45.640
Perhaps someday Starfleet
and the Federation

52:45.684 --> 52:48.687
may change its views, but today

52:48.730 --> 52:50.515
I'm afraid all we can do
is consider

52:50.558 --> 52:51.994
what the defense has asked.

52:52.038 --> 52:54.214
That we judge the defendant's

52:54.258 --> 52:56.999
specific case

52:57.043 --> 53:00.960
and unique circumstances
independently.

53:01.003 --> 53:02.657
And in that,

53:02.701 --> 53:04.920
we grant the defendant's
request for asylum

53:04.964 --> 53:07.401
and find Una Chin-Riley

53:07.445 --> 53:11.013
not guilty of all charges.

53:21.546 --> 53:23.330
[boatswain's whistle blows]

53:23.374 --> 53:25.593
PIKE:
First officer on deck.

53:36.125 --> 53:38.519
-You set me up.
-How so?

53:38.563 --> 53:40.913
You figured it all out.
My admission.

53:40.956 --> 53:42.828
What would happen
when you put me on the stand.

53:42.871 --> 53:44.873
-You knew all of it.
-No.

53:44.917 --> 53:46.571
Not all of it.

53:46.614 --> 53:49.138
Thank you for saving my life.

53:49.182 --> 53:51.880
Hey, what are friends for?

53:51.924 --> 53:54.840
Yeah.

53:54.883 --> 53:58.104
I'm sorry we didn't
do more for Illyrians.

53:58.147 --> 54:00.628
This was a technicality.

54:00.672 --> 54:02.630
It's a start.

54:13.859 --> 54:15.904
[whooping]

54:23.564 --> 54:26.306
As you all know, I am not

54:26.350 --> 54:28.003
the biggest fan of Starfleet.

54:30.354 --> 54:34.053
But I am looking
at a starship crew

54:34.096 --> 54:37.709
that proudly serves under
an Illyrian commander.

54:40.059 --> 54:43.541
So, like I said...

54:43.584 --> 54:46.326
it's a start.

54:50.112 --> 54:52.201
Energize.

54:56.380 --> 54:58.164
Hey.

54:58.207 --> 55:01.036
-La'An.
-Welcome home, Chief.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.082
Place wasn't the same
without you.

55:05.519 --> 55:08.696
If you're all here,
who's flying the ship?

55:08.740 --> 55:12.178
Oh, the thing
practically flies itself.

55:12.221 --> 55:14.049
Back to your stations,
all of you.

55:18.402 --> 55:19.881
[door whooshes open]

55:23.842 --> 55:25.887
[door whooshes closed]

55:37.246 --> 55:38.683
Good to have you back,
Number One.

55:38.726 --> 55:40.772
Good to be back, Captain.

55:44.036 --> 55:46.647
[door whooshes open]
