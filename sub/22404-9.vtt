{\an8}what'd you wanna
talk to us about?

01:44.562 --> 01:47.941

is low on money.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.282
- What?

01:56.366 --> 01:57.700
Why would Swellview
be low on money?

- Two words: Our New
High Speed Railroad.

high speed rail project

02:08.961 --> 02:10.588
is costing the tax payers
10 billion dollars.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.759
- I know.
Pretty stupid, right?

02:14.843 --> 02:15.885
- Yeah.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.178
- Anyway, we're building it.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.225
So that means
we won't have money

02:22.308 --> 02:24.727
for other things,
such as crime fighting.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.523
which is why we're cutting
your budget by 90%.

- 90?!
- Per what?!?

02:31.776 --> 02:33.403

gonna take away

02:34.863 --> 02:36.823

we get from the city,

02:36.906 --> 02:39.367

on a railroad!

03:34.464 --> 03:36.466
- And to buy fuel
for the Man Copter.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.093
to fight crime
and keep this city safe

03:39.177 --> 03:40.720

all of our money?

03:40.803 --> 03:41.512
- Good questions--

03:41.596 --> 03:43.306
for which I have no answer.
