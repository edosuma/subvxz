CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
COLUMBIA TRISTAR
DOMESTIC TELEVISION

00:05.761 --> 00:07.962
NEVER LIKED THE CHECK AT
THE END OF THE MEAL SYSTEM.

00:07.996 --> 00:10.298
MONEY'S DIFFERENT
BEFORE AND AFTER YOU EAT.

00:10.332 --> 00:12.967
BEFORE YOU EAT,
MONEY HAS NO VALUE.

00:13.001 --> 00:15.803
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY
WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY.

00:15.838 --> 00:18.773
YOU'RE LIKE THE RULER
OF AN EMPIRE--MORE DRINKS!

00:18.807 --> 00:19.941
APPETIZERS!

00:19.975 --> 00:21.976
QUICKLY, QUICKLY.

00:22.010 --> 00:25.980
IT WILL BE THE GREATEST
MEAL OF OUR LIVES.

00:26.014 --> 00:30.818
THEN AFTER THE MEAL, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT THE PANTS OPEN,

00:30.853 --> 00:32.653
YOU GOT
THE NAPKINS DESTROYED,

00:32.688 --> 00:35.156
CIGARETTE BUTT
IN THE MASHED POTATOES.

00:35.190 --> 00:37.825
THEN THE CHECK COMES
AT THAT MOMENT.

00:37.860 --> 00:40.228
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS UPSET,
YOU KNOW.

00:40.262 --> 00:43.464
THEY'RE MYSTIFIED
BY THE CHECK.

00:43.499 --> 00:46.467
WHAT IS THIS?

00:46.502 --> 00:48.336
HOW COULD THIS BE?

00:48.370 --> 00:50.671
THEY START PASSING IT
AROUND THE TABLE.

00:50.706 --> 00:53.975
DOES THIS LOOK
RIGHT TO YOU?

00:54.009 --> 00:55.510
WE'RE NOT HUNGRY NOW.

00:55.544 --> 01:00.348
WHY ARE WE BUYING
ALL THIS FOOD?

01:00.382 --> 01:04.584
I THINK SUPERMAN
PROBABLY HAS A VERY
GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.821
I NEVER HEARD HIM
SAY ANYTHING FUNNY.

01:06.855 --> 01:08.356
IT'S COMMON SENSE.

01:08.390 --> 01:10.725
HE'S GOT SUPER STRENGTH,
SUPER SPEED.

01:10.759 --> 01:13.060
I'M SURE HE'S GOT
SUPER HUMOR.

01:13.095 --> 01:16.197
YOU'D THINK THAT,
BUT EITHER YOU'RE
BORN WITH HUMOR

01:16.231 --> 01:18.332
OR YOU'RE NOT.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE.

01:18.367 --> 01:21.536
EVEN AFTER GOING
FROM THE RED SUN
OF KRYPTON

01:21.570 --> 01:23.871
TO THE YELLOW SUN
OF EARTH.

01:23.906 --> 01:26.874
WHY? WHY WOULD THAT
ONE AREA OF HIS MIND

01:26.909 --> 01:30.344
NOT BE AFFECTED BY
THE YELLOW SUN OF EARTH?

01:30.379 --> 01:33.648
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT HE AIN'T FUNNY.

01:33.682 --> 01:37.118
HI. I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

01:37.152 --> 01:38.419
NO PROBLEM.

01:40.222 --> 01:41.689
I DROPPED A GRAPE.

01:41.723 --> 01:42.823
WHAT?

01:42.858 --> 01:44.592
I DROPPED A GRAPE
IN THE KITCHEN,

01:44.626 --> 01:46.294
AND IT DISAPPEARED.

01:46.328 --> 01:47.662
I COULDN'T FIND IT.

01:47.696 --> 01:50.498
I WAS ON MY KNEES
FOR 10 MINUTES

01:50.532 --> 01:53.000
LOOKING FOR
THIS STUPID GRAPE.

01:53.035 --> 01:57.538
I HAVE NO IDEA
WH-WHERE IT WENT.

01:57.573 --> 02:00.741
WERE YOU CRYING?
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
A GRAPE.

02:00.776 --> 02:02.276
YOU'LL FIND IT.

02:02.311 --> 02:04.946
NO. I'M JUST GETTING OVER
AN ALLERGY ATTACK.

02:04.980 --> 02:06.247
THIS GUY I'M
GOING OUT WITH--

02:06.281 --> 02:07.415
ROBERT.

02:07.449 --> 02:08.416
ROBERT.

02:08.449 --> 02:10.651
YES. THANK YOU.

02:11.954 --> 02:15.389
HE HAS TWO CATS,
AND I'M ALLERGIC TO THEM.

02:15.424 --> 02:19.560
YOU KNOW, I FINALLY
MEET A NORMAL MAN,

02:19.595 --> 02:22.563
AND I CAN'T EVEN GO
INTO HIS APARTMENT.

02:22.598 --> 02:25.199
OF COURSE MY APARTMENT
IS THE ACTORS' STUDIO,

02:25.233 --> 02:27.068
SO WE CAN'T GO THERE.

02:27.102 --> 02:29.070
IT'S CAUSING A LOT OF
PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW?

02:29.104 --> 02:32.139
HE WON'T EVEN LEAVE
HIS CATS FOR THE WEEKEND.

02:32.174 --> 02:35.543
GUYS WITH CATS--
I DON'T KNOW.

02:35.577 --> 02:38.312
I'M CONSIDERING
ASKING THIS GIRL
I'M SEEING--

02:38.347 --> 02:39.280
VANESSA?

02:40.515 --> 02:42.049
VANESSA. THANK YOU.

02:42.084 --> 02:45.419
I'M CONSIDERING
ASKING HER TO GO
AWAY A COUPLE DAYS.

02:45.454 --> 02:46.520
OH, NO.

02:46.555 --> 02:49.056
I'D HAVE TO
ADVISE
AGAINST THAT.

02:49.091 --> 02:51.392
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW THIS WOMAN,
A MONTH?

02:51.426 --> 02:53.060
YOU'LL BE
TOGETHER
72 HOURS.

02:53.095 --> 02:54.829
THAT'S
A DATING
DECATHLON.

02:54.863 --> 02:58.833
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HER TO THAT
PLACE IN VERMONT?

02:58.867 --> 03:03.437
IT'S REALLY CHARMING--
WITH SEPARATE FAUCETS
FOR THE HOT AND COLD.

03:03.472 --> 03:05.139
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

03:06.608 --> 03:09.510
THAT'S EXQUISITE.
LISTEN, IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

03:09.544 --> 03:12.313
COULD YOU PASS ME
THAT PAPER
OVER THERE?

03:12.347 --> 03:14.315
JUST THE BUSINESS
SECTION.

03:14.349 --> 03:16.017
YOU BETTER
FIND THAT GRAPE

03:16.051 --> 03:18.853
BEFORE IT MUTATES
INTO ANOTHER LIFE FORM.

03:18.887 --> 03:21.188
THERE WAS ONCE
A MUTANT GRAPE

03:21.223 --> 03:22.990
THAT TERRORIZED
AN ENTIRE TOWN

03:23.025 --> 03:24.325
IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE.

03:24.359 --> 03:26.127
THEY BROUGHT IN
THE ARMY.

03:26.161 --> 03:27.662
NOBODY COULD STOP IT.

03:27.696 --> 03:30.398
APPARENTLY, IT HAD
A PIT OF STEEL.

03:32.501 --> 03:33.768
UP AGAIN.

03:33.802 --> 03:35.169
THIS IS
INCREDIBLE.

03:35.203 --> 03:36.370
I'M--I'M
GETTING IT.

03:36.405 --> 03:37.438
GETTING WHAT?

03:37.472 --> 03:38.673
A STOCK.

03:38.707 --> 03:39.707
WHAT STOCK?

03:39.741 --> 03:41.042
YOU EVER MEET
SIMONS?

03:41.076 --> 03:42.076
MAYBE.

03:42.110 --> 03:43.411
HIS FRIEND
WILKENSON

03:43.445 --> 03:45.579
MADE A FORTUNE
IN THE MARKET.

03:45.614 --> 03:48.516
HE'S GOT
SOME NEW THING--
A BIG MERGER.

03:48.550 --> 03:50.985
I WASN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO
SAY ANYTHING.

03:51.019 --> 03:52.453
YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER THIS.

03:52.487 --> 03:54.355
HOW HIGH'S IT
SUPPOSED TO GO?

03:54.389 --> 03:56.857
SIMONS SAID
WILKENSON
WOULD TELL ME

03:56.892 --> 03:58.959
THE EXACT
MINUTE TO SELL.

3 POINTS

04:27.756 --> 04:28.923

WATCHED IT.

CONCEPT OF LUNCH

04:56.518 --> 04:57.852

INCORPORATE

04:59.154 --> 05:02.123

IN YOUR DAILY ROUTINE?

05:02.157 --> 05:05.626
WHEN I'M DRIVING, I LET
PEOPLE IN ALL THE TIME.

05:05.660 --> 05:07.461

EVERYBODY IN.

RUINED THAT MOVIE FOR ME.

DO SOMETHING?

THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT THAT TRIP?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.581
YEAH. I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.

ABOUT IT.

06:05.921 --> 06:07.388
IT'S LOTS
OF PRESSURE.

06:07.422 --> 06:09.423
IT'S GREAT. IT SPEEDS UP
THE INTIMACY LEVEL.

06:09.457 --> 06:12.393
IT'S LIKE PUTTING
THE RELATIONSHIP
IN A TIME COMPRESSOR.

YOU SHOULD
GET THE RECEIPT.

11:13.278 --> 11:14.678

THE RECEIPT.

11:14.712 --> 11:16.613

THE RECEIPT,
LOOK AT IT.

EVEN WANT THE MONEY.

I CAN'T THINK
OF ANY SOLUTION.

THEY SHOULD MEET

UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT.
