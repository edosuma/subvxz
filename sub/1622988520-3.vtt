WEBVTT

00:06.789 --> 00:09.574
Oh, simple Allison.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.534
<i>Previously on
"Kevin Can Himself"...</i>

00:12.577 --> 00:15.363
I just don't know when
I got so isolated from everyone.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.147
You blew up my life.
Was that just for fun?

00:17.191 --> 00:18.801
I felt sorry for you.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.368
I was hoping to do
some computer research.

00:20.411 --> 00:23.153
About a woman who
decides to kill her husband.

00:23.197 --> 00:26.461
I killed with oxycodone
and made it look like an O.D.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.724
These types of pills
get abused.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.726
Yeah, I've heard.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.162
I swear I know someone.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.337
Thank you.

00:33.381 --> 00:36.036
Oh, it's drugs.
Shit.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.130
Dad!

00:43.173 --> 00:45.132
I hope you still have
some contacts

00:45.175 --> 00:46.394
in the Miracles Department
of the church,

00:46.437 --> 00:47.569
because this... Oh.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.092
...qualifies.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.921
That is
a great bag.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.705
Very roomy.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.838
I think he's talking about
what's inside.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.970
Please don't be alive.
Please don't be alive.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.624
Also,
please don't be dead.

01:01.104 --> 01:02.410
So, there I was,
walking down the street.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.107
No one else was around
when -- boom!

01:04.151 --> 01:07.806
This just appeared
in front of me.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.984
Kevin!

01:12.028 --> 01:14.639
"Hart Live
at the Worcester Centrum."

01:14.683 --> 01:16.467
W-- You took that?!

01:16.511 --> 01:19.557
The wind took it off the side
of the Worcester Centrum.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.429
And it's got
your name on it,

01:21.472 --> 01:23.561
so legally,
it belongs to you.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.521
Wow, your grasp of the legal
system is so interesting.

01:26.564 --> 01:29.045
My public defender
said the same thing.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.135
Let's hang my banner off
the side of the house, yeah?

01:32.179 --> 01:34.181
After we staple
the good sheets over

01:34.224 --> 01:36.052
anything that doesn't say
"Kevin."

01:36.096 --> 01:37.836
Why would you specify
the good--

01:37.880 --> 01:39.360
Never mind.

01:39.403 --> 01:42.058
Alright, ideas on
how we can do this?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.973
I got
my dad's towing winches.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.366
You're a winch.

01:46.845 --> 01:49.848
No, guys,
we use the towing winches

01:49.892 --> 01:51.415
to do
a pulley system.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.765
A "system?"
Patty, we're climbing one roof.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.071
We're not
gonna take Vegas.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.420
I know.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.205
Neil, you shimmy up
the drain pipe

01:58.248 --> 02:00.120
and hang it off
the old lightning rod.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.904
I'm sure it doesn't
do anything important.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.079
Please be careful.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.472
On it.
Fine!
Do it your way!

02:04.515 --> 02:06.474
Oh.
I'd say
break a leg...

02:06.517 --> 02:07.649
Wait, I'm stuck!...but Neil
most definitely will.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.501
My brother
broke his leg.

02:33.544 --> 02:36.199
40 megs of OxyContin,
comin' up.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.203
Remember you missed prom
'cause Neil got a concussion?

02:41.813 --> 02:43.250
Yeah, Terrance.

02:43.293 --> 02:46.078
That's why
I didn't go to the prom.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.820
I called ahead, you know.
They should be ready.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.082
Gotta wait all day?

02:51.562 --> 02:53.521
You know,
these pills are pricey.

02:53.564 --> 02:56.045
I could get my hands
on some generics for you.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.438
In the future.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.875
It's alright.
Medicaid covers it.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.268
I mean, like...

03:01.311 --> 03:03.487
they only give you
10 of these.

03:03.531 --> 03:06.273
So if your brother
ever needs a refill,

03:06.316 --> 03:09.580
come back and see me
for the generic.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.367
Oh, I --

03:14.890 --> 03:17.936
No.

03:19.895 --> 03:20.939
You got a degree.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.550
A good job.

03:22.593 --> 03:25.117
Don't be an idiot
with this stuff, Terrance.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.858
With what?

03:31.907 --> 03:34.257
Okay, lady,
let's get you out of this chair.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.911
Ooh.
You got it?

03:35.954 --> 03:37.869
I'm not
an invalid yet.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.437
Okay. Okay.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.443
Oh, before I forget,
hand me my pocket book.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.142
I think
you'll like it.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.928
Nobody has taken it out
in ages,

03:52.971 --> 03:55.104
so, eh,
just keep it.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.501
Thanks.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.459
Oh, Jesus.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.679
Oh...

04:04.722 --> 04:07.682
Hey.
You okay?

04:07.725 --> 04:09.336
It's just
this damn sciatica.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.339
My do-gooder
sister-in-law's

04:12.382 --> 04:14.602
taken to picking up
my groceries for me.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.299
I-I-It's just hard.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.692
Friggin' doctor visits

04:17.735 --> 04:19.215
are too expensive
without insurance,

04:19.259 --> 04:20.564
and the pain
is just --

04:20.608 --> 04:24.133
You know, some days,
it's just bad.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.135
Judi.

04:26.178 --> 04:29.007
I'm fine.

04:41.411 --> 04:44.806
I'm gonna be needing
some generics.

05:00.430 --> 05:03.215
What the hell
are you doing here?

05:03.259 --> 05:04.391
I --
You've never
been in here before.

05:04.434 --> 05:07.568
I know.
But I want a wash.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.876
Like Barb gets.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.400
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.532
I need them.
I need it.

05:15.576 --> 05:16.881
Why?

05:16.925 --> 05:19.580
Back pain.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.672
Bullshit.
Okay, well,
how the hell would you know?

05:24.715 --> 05:26.891
Because you're a terrible
liar. Even you don't believe
what you're saying.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.416
Oh, Jesus, why does this
have to be so hard?

05:31.896 --> 05:33.158
I don't have anything
for you.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.378
Of course you don't.

05:35.422 --> 05:39.687
You'll have to wait
till I re-up Monday afternoon.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.471
W-- Monday?

05:41.515 --> 05:44.256
Like, this Monday?
Like, three da-- Like, 72 hours?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.302
We all know
you can do math.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.218
Okay, that --
Monday is great.

05:49.261 --> 05:50.872
That is amazing.

05:50.915 --> 05:54.441
I will be here
for the wash on Monday.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.225
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.487
Okay.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.228
But for now,
get out of here.

05:59.271 --> 06:02.013
Is it, like,
dangerous or something?

06:02.057 --> 06:03.319
No.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.670
I'm just done
being around you.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.240
Thank you.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.638
Here for
another free coffee?

06:17.681 --> 06:19.727
Wait, you serve
free coffee here?

06:19.770 --> 06:22.338
Uh, you keep leaving
before you actually pay.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.732
Oh, my gosh.
You're right.

06:24.775 --> 06:27.256
I -- Well, I promise
to pay for this one --

06:27.299 --> 06:29.040
and the other two.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.738
It's been sitting for a while.
Make a fresh pot.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.566
No, no,
I'm not picky.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.744
Um...

06:36.787 --> 06:40.269
I am sorry
for the other night.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.184
Just had
a really bad day,

06:42.227 --> 06:45.274
and you were saying some stuff
that I didn't, uh --

06:45.317 --> 06:46.536
It's not
a big deal.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.452
Wha--
No, I was rude.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.846
When I'm around you,
I feel --

06:51.889 --> 06:55.023
I don't know -- 15,
and I was a brat at 15.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.504
So I am sorry.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.727
It's cold.
I told you
I'd make a new pot.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.337
I c-- it's not --No, no.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.775
No, it's okay.
I deserve this.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.779
Mmm.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.085
Mm. Mm.
So stoic.

07:18.133 --> 07:21.745
I'm sorry, too.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.748
I think I was kinda harsh
to cover the fact

07:24.792 --> 07:27.795
that seeing you again
makes me feel a little...

07:27.838 --> 07:28.883
guilty.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.102
Oh, yeah?

07:31.146 --> 07:33.409
When I was working the steps
with my sponsor,

07:33.453 --> 07:36.368
I listed out people
to make amends to,

07:36.412 --> 07:38.545
and you
were on there.

07:38.588 --> 07:41.373
Maybe towards the top.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.159
If anyone
deserved a call...

07:44.202 --> 07:45.900
I just
didn't do it.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.380
What,
did you lose my number?

07:48.424 --> 07:50.339
Nope,
just a coward.

07:55.039 --> 07:58.695
You know, I'm getting my chip
in AA tomorrow night.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.218
Eight years sober.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.393
Eight years?
Yeah.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.004
Wow!

08:03.047 --> 08:05.702
Feel like I don't even know
this version of you.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.837
You look the same,
though.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.491
♪ <i>Please give me a chance</i>♪

08:11.534 --> 08:14.189
I like that
you think I'm the same.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.627
You are.

08:17.671 --> 08:22.458
They say to invite people
to these things.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.462
Would you come?

08:26.506 --> 08:29.378
Consider it
me making my amends.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.603
So, you got a special occasion
you wanna look nice for?

08:36.646 --> 08:39.170
Sure, my husband's
taking me to Paris.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.784
No,
this is self-care.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.873
Last time,
we did those swoopy layers.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.744
Cathy in accountin' says,
"Nice haircut."

08:47.788 --> 08:49.529
And I knew
what she meant.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.444
Woman #And she's insisting
on a band. Can you imagine?

08:52.488 --> 08:53.794
No.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.186
Hey.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.840
Hey, Cindy.

08:56.884 --> 09:00.061
Hoping you can squeeze me in
for a wash?

09:00.104 --> 09:02.063
Okay, great.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.456
One sec, hon.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.676
Let's have a look
at the book.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.115
So, thing is,
I'm cleaned out at the moment.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.901
Oh.
We had a couple people
in rough shape this week,

09:13.944 --> 09:15.380
needed a bit more,
but I'm re-upping Monday.

09:15.424 --> 09:18.209
I sorta
need 'em now.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.342
Listen, Cindy,
I know your knee's blown,

09:20.385 --> 09:22.649
but for a day or two,
toss back a few ibuprofen.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.085
It'll be fine.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.043
Patty. Ibuprofen?
Are you serious?!

09:29.307 --> 09:31.527
I really need them.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.921
Okay.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.792
Let me see
what I can do, okay?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.664
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.144
Thank you.
Oh.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.929
For last time.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.845
Thanks f-for frontin'
for me.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.934
It won't happen again.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.196
No big thing.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.516
Hey, babe, you might want
to keep your coat on,

10:04.560 --> 10:07.476
'cause it's about
to get "chili" in here.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.870
Chili, the food.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.698
Thank you
for clearing that up, Neil.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.353
Can't you just buy the chili
this year?

10:15.397 --> 10:17.399
Sweet Allison.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.706
The Renzulli Brothers
don't plow our street

10:19.749 --> 10:21.621
in exchange
for store-bought chili.

10:21.664 --> 10:22.970
No, they do it
'cause we pay taxes.

10:23.013 --> 10:26.190
The Renzulli Brothers
plow our street

10:26.234 --> 10:28.628
early and often
because we bribe them in,

10:28.671 --> 10:31.326
and I quote, "Yummy-nummy chili
in their tummies."

10:32.544 --> 10:34.285
That's right,
and this year,

10:34.329 --> 10:35.722
we're making
an extra-special batch

10:35.765 --> 10:37.549
with deep-fried
turkey meat --

10:37.593 --> 10:39.726
prepared, of course,
using my brand-new

10:39.769 --> 10:43.381
55,000 BTU All-Pro Stainless
Steel Turkey Deep Fryer.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.687
Ooh!

10:44.731 --> 10:46.646
She is
a sexy little contraption.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.691
I call her
the "Dirty Birdie."

10:48.735 --> 10:50.214
Is that the, uh --

10:50.258 --> 10:51.999
the thing that's set up
in our driveway?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.783
Bingo!
Best to do it outdoors.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.003
Frying a turkey
can be very dangerous.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.744
Yeah,
sometimes they explode,

10:57.787 --> 11:00.311
and no one knows why.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.704
Sounds violent.

11:01.748 --> 11:05.621
Don't worry, Mom,
I'll be careful.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.623
Oh.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.321
Neil's cooking
the exploding turkey.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.106
Yeah. Why?

11:12.149 --> 11:13.411
I guess
I was just confused

11:13.455 --> 11:14.761
'cause you usually
cook the meat,

11:14.804 --> 11:16.153
so I thought
it was your chili.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.286
It is, since I'm the magician
behind it.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.985
Uh, well, you know,
we both work on it, so...

11:22.029 --> 11:24.596
Yeah,
but I'm the main magician.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.947
You're the random
audience member

11:26.990 --> 11:29.166
we can all agree
I've never met before.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.996
Um,
you're wrong.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.303
What?

11:35.346 --> 11:37.000
I said "no offense."

11:37.044 --> 11:38.393
No,
you didn't.

11:38.436 --> 11:39.786
I'm wrong?

11:39.829 --> 11:42.310
Uh,
if I'm so wrong,

11:42.353 --> 11:44.355
how come my plans, ideas,
and goof-arounds work out

11:44.399 --> 11:46.053
99% of the time?

11:46.096 --> 11:48.795
Uh, 'cause you got me jukin'
stats and crackin' skulls.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.231
You need me.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.363
Pssh,
I don't need anybody.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.974
Fine,
then I'll take my

11:54.017 --> 11:55.627
55,000 BTU All-Pro Stainless
Steel Turkey Deep Fryer

11:55.671 --> 11:57.064
and make my own chili,

11:57.107 --> 11:59.936
and it's gonna blow yours
into the water.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.854
A chili cook-off?

12:04.898 --> 12:06.682
Good luck making anything
the Renzulli Bros respect

12:06.726 --> 12:07.988
without my help.

12:08.031 --> 12:11.208
Pfff.
I don't need your help!

12:12.688 --> 12:14.298
-'Cause I've got Allison!
-Oh!

12:14.342 --> 12:16.387
She's gonna help me
cook the chili,

12:16.431 --> 12:18.259
and she is
way better than you.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.523
I can't believe
you'd stoop that low.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.830
Oh, we're playing limbo now,
baby.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.049
You don't even <i>know
how low I can go!</i>

12:26.093 --> 12:27.572
Welcome to
the Dream Team, baby.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.969
Yeah, you get out of here
with that turkey.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.275
Leave my carrot!

13:06.916 --> 13:08.918
Neil's not in there.
Geez.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.703
Starting to think
I should tie a little bell

13:11.747 --> 13:12.835
to all
your cardigans.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.924
This is
a new look for you.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.361
No, it's actually
an old look.

13:17.405 --> 13:21.061
I used to have a burger
every day after swim practice.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.453
I had to earn it.

13:22.497 --> 13:23.890
You go swimming today?

13:23.933 --> 13:26.240
Nope,
but I earned it.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.459
And...

13:28.503 --> 13:30.548
the second one
was only 50¢,

13:30.592 --> 13:32.768
and I can't pass up
a deal, so...

13:32.812 --> 13:35.162
You want it?

13:44.127 --> 13:46.173
Mm.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.784
Of course you're the kind of
girl who's always cold.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.787
Why are you
eating outside?

13:52.832 --> 13:56.183
Um,
I'm just stalling.

13:56.226 --> 13:59.012
Kevin's inside.
He and Neil got into a fight.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.970
-They don't do that.
-They do now,
I guess.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.972
It was nice
for the first 30 seconds

14:03.016 --> 14:04.191
until Kevin started
looking to me

14:04.234 --> 14:05.932
to fill
the Neil-sized hole.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.324
As soon
as I go in there,

14:07.368 --> 14:08.499
he's gonna
put me to work.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.023
So,
don't do it.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.026
Like that's an option.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.985
He's just gonna whine
until I, like,

14:16.029 --> 14:18.770
drive 90 miles
to get pork belly,

14:18.814 --> 14:20.729
or something stupid
like that.

14:20.772 --> 14:23.558
This fight between 'em's
gonna be the end of me.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.429
Allison,
I'm always impressed

14:25.473 --> 14:27.388
with how you can make
nothing to do with you

14:27.431 --> 14:29.172
all about you.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.782
Okay.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.219
Well,
if I'm so obnoxious,

14:32.262 --> 14:33.742
why don't you
go in there

14:33.785 --> 14:35.962
and deal with
Kevin's chili hysteria?

14:36.005 --> 14:37.964
Or go home
and deal with Neil's.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.922
Go on, Patty.
Go be one of the boys.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.798
I knew it.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.670
You hate them
as much as I do.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.326
-I don't hate them.
-Yes, you do.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.241
I knew it.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.199
I knew there was
something else going on.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.635
I just didn't know
it was selling drugs.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.682
Can you just
be cool?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.424
I'm right.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.817
That's way better.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.952
I'm so glad
you're eating healthy with me.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.347
I can't
do anything alone.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.089
Glad my company
is good for something.

15:16.132 --> 15:19.135
You're good
for more than that.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.661
Got "Ray Donovan"
all ready to go.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.402
I'm hooked.
Ugh.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.578
His accent's for shit,
though.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.971
Yeah.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.582
It's true.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.413
Mmm.

15:38.633 --> 15:42.289
Guess how much
this salad cost us?

15:42.332 --> 15:43.768
60¢.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.815
Well, no.

15:46.858 --> 15:51.080
I mean,
$2.49, though?

15:51.124 --> 15:53.300
Plus the dressing,
which we already had,

15:53.343 --> 15:56.607
but at a salad bar,
we'd be paying 7 bucks each --

15:56.651 --> 15:58.435
plus tip and tax.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.395
Maybe by summer,
we'll save up enough

16:01.438 --> 16:02.831
for our own place
on the Cape --

16:02.874 --> 16:04.833
show off our skinny arms
on the beach.

16:04.876 --> 16:07.444
Yeah, maybe.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.074
Hey, maybe tonight,
we could --

16:28.117 --> 16:31.120
Do you mind
if we don't tonight?

16:31.164 --> 16:33.949
Oh, yeah.
Of course.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.343
I'm just
really tired.

16:36.386 --> 16:39.041
Yeah, you don't
have to explain.

16:39.085 --> 16:42.479
It's -- I'm always happy
just sitting here with you.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.440
Yeah.
Me, too.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.364
Hey, babe.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.322
It's Sunday,
Sunday, Sunday!

16:59.366 --> 17:02.456
Ugh,
it's the day of rest.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.720
Only for lazy people like Neil
who lose chili cook-offs

17:05.763 --> 17:07.896
'cause they rest
on their Lauras.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.593
Rest on their what?

17:09.637 --> 17:11.334
Like, when you're sleeping
with some chick named Laura

17:11.378 --> 17:12.683
and you don't want to get
out of the bed,

17:12.727 --> 17:14.076
you're lazy.

17:15.556 --> 17:18.037
I learn so much
being married to you.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.342
I love you,
too, babe.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.996
I have to go
run an errand,

17:21.040 --> 17:23.346
but it's for a huge surprise
I have planned for ya.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.783
Planned for me?
Of course.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.698
Well, last time you said you
had something planned for me,

17:27.742 --> 17:29.613
you and Neil went
to Rock 'N' Roll Camp.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.008
Who doesn't like
a weekend alone?

17:34.879 --> 17:37.969
Now, I expect you back here this
afternoon for your surprise.

17:38.013 --> 17:41.364
Kevin and Allison,
together forevah!

18:09.479 --> 18:13.004
And I never called before,
Terrance.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.006
Isn't it good that I'm out?

18:15.050 --> 18:19.228
I mean,
I'm -- I'm selling, right?

18:19.272 --> 18:22.492
And this is important, so --

18:22.536 --> 18:24.581
Hell--

18:24.625 --> 18:26.192
Geez.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.719
Oh, hell.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.377
Yes?

18:37.420 --> 18:40.031
Um, I was hoping
you did walk-ins?

18:40.075 --> 18:41.468
Look,
I said Monday, okay?

18:41.511 --> 18:42.860
Why is everybody up my ass
this week?

18:42.904 --> 18:44.253
I mean it.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.603
I was hoping you could
give me, like,

18:46.647 --> 18:48.127
a beachy wave
or somethin'.

18:49.432 --> 18:50.912
You say "hoping"
a lot.

18:50.955 --> 18:54.350
Well, it's nicer
than saying "I want."

18:56.222 --> 18:58.485
Just a curl,
not a whole wash.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.792
I'll take it.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.620
Whee!

19:03.664 --> 19:06.232
You got a special occasion
you wanna look nice for?

19:06.275 --> 19:07.972
Uh, I was hop--

19:08.016 --> 19:10.236
I want
to look nice,

19:10.279 --> 19:13.456
but, uh, I'm not sure
it's a special occasion.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.024
I -- Well, promise you won't
tell Kevin?

19:16.067 --> 19:17.504
We're in that

19:17.547 --> 19:19.245
mutually-assured-destruction
territory now, yeah?

19:19.288 --> 19:20.855
Right.

19:20.898 --> 19:24.250
Well, uh,
I am seeing an ex.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.252
Well,
not really an ex.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.515
He, um -- We used to
bus tables together

19:28.558 --> 19:30.517
at this really terrible
Mexican restaurant --

19:30.560 --> 19:31.866
Aunt Chiladas?

19:31.909 --> 19:33.259
No,
Sloppy José's.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.043
Yeah.

19:35.086 --> 19:38.220
I guess we never actually,
like, "dated."

19:38.264 --> 19:41.267
He was always with this girl
from Amherst.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.138
Jenn,
with two "N's."

19:43.182 --> 19:44.966
Mm,
I hate her.

19:45.009 --> 19:48.535
Um, I would lock up
and he would turn the sign off,

19:48.578 --> 19:50.841
and then we would go in back
in the kitchen

19:50.885 --> 19:52.713
and fool around.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.106
And I didn't know Jenn
that well,

19:55.150 --> 19:57.935
so it didn't seem
quite as terrible.

19:57.979 --> 20:01.069
It just felt like
I wanted to beat her.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.289
And it was fun
and dangerous.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.900
Having sex
in front of the tortilla chips

20:05.943 --> 20:07.641
is your idea
of dangerous?

20:07.684 --> 20:10.383
Well, it's the worst thing
I've ever done.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.167
So, you're gonna
go fool around.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.560
No.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.301
Kinda sounds like
you want to.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.694
-He's married.
-You're married.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.261
E-- Of co--
Yes, of course.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.871
We're both married,
yes.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.438
It's not gonna happen.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.572
And this
is what you're wearing?

20:25.615 --> 20:26.964
Hey.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.576
I'm just saying.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.882
You have that wrap dress
from the Gap.

20:31.926 --> 20:35.321
Well, I'm going to go home
and change, okay?

20:36.626 --> 20:38.149
So,
what about you?

20:38.193 --> 20:40.195
You have fun
hanging out with Kurt?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.892
Huh?

20:41.936 --> 20:44.591
Did you have fun?

20:44.634 --> 20:47.333
Uh, yeah.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.812
It was fine.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.162
Okay,
did you go out, or...?

20:52.816 --> 20:55.558
No.
Oh, okay.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.908
Well, that's nice.
A man who can cook.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.259
Unless he's bad at it.
Is he bad at it?

21:00.302 --> 21:02.173
I don't know.
He -- He's Kurt.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.175
He opened a bag of salad,
put it on a plate,

21:04.219 --> 21:05.612
and then
watched me eat it.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.181
Okay, well, I'd take that
over being chained to Kevin

21:10.225 --> 21:12.923
while he makes the world's
most disgusting chili.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.755
Kurt thinks
we're eating healthy together.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.628
That cheeseburger
I had last night

21:21.671 --> 21:23.020
was my third
this week.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.590
Shut up.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.639
Oh, you got all done up for me,
huh, sweetie?

21:32.682 --> 21:34.989
Really putting yourself
out there, aren't ya?

21:35.032 --> 21:37.513
Yeah, settling in
to your new profession.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.385
Hey, let me know
if you want me to set up

21:39.428 --> 21:41.952
any more appointments
under the bridge.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.483
Yes, hello.

21:50.526 --> 21:53.224
Um, I was just walking by
Clark Street Elementary,

21:53.268 --> 21:54.878
and I saw a man
selling drugs.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.664
And I followed him to
the auto body on Buckingham Ave.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.970
He works there.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.407
Please help, because I don't
want this monster

22:01.450 --> 22:04.323
getting children
hooked on drugs.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.150
Okay, well, you're welcome.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.978
Thank you for your time.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.415
Okay, bye-bye.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.076
Kev, you back yet?

22:29.043 --> 22:31.524
Jesus Christ, Kev, come on.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.450
Oh, hey!

22:44.493 --> 22:46.016
Perfect timing!

22:46.060 --> 22:47.931
Guess what I got?

22:47.975 --> 22:50.020
A pig.

22:50.064 --> 22:51.457
Dinga-ding-ding!

22:51.500 --> 22:53.372
This is
our trump card, baby!

22:53.415 --> 22:55.243
It's, um,
staring at me.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.853
Can you --

22:56.897 --> 22:59.029
Oh, there you go.
Much better.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.335
Peek-a-boo!
Oh!

23:00.379 --> 23:01.728
Just kidding.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.294
Ah!

23:03.338 --> 23:04.731
I'm just kidding.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.560
Stupid Neil
thinks he's gonna win

23:07.603 --> 23:09.475
with bird meat
when I got a pig on my side!

23:11.085 --> 23:14.436
This is game over,
right here.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.525
Certainly is
for the pig.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.527
I'm gonna cook him
as God intended --

23:18.571 --> 23:21.051
all night long
over a roaring open flame

23:21.095 --> 23:22.444
10 feet
from our house.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.446
It's gonna be
a great time, babe!

23:24.490 --> 23:25.621
You're gonna love it.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.190
I'm gonna love it?

23:29.233 --> 23:31.322
Oh, yes.
That's my surprise.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.803
You and me --
Kevin and Allison --

23:33.847 --> 23:36.458
the greatest duo that
this backyard has ever seen.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.286
We got
eight hours of togetherness

23:38.329 --> 23:40.288
over a roasting pig.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.551
You want me
to be here?

23:42.595 --> 23:44.379
I can't do this
on my own!

23:44.423 --> 23:45.859
Not that
I need anyone!

23:45.902 --> 23:47.774
Okay, well,
all you have to do

23:47.817 --> 23:50.080
is just watch an open flame
and try not to fall asleep,

23:50.124 --> 23:51.734
so w-why do you
need me here?

23:51.778 --> 23:54.433
It's so much more than just
not falling asleep.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.652
Neil and I...

23:58.393 --> 24:00.787
That neighbor guy
and I

24:00.830 --> 24:03.442
used to do this
sort of stuff all the time.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.618
Come on,
it's gonna be the best time.

24:05.661 --> 24:08.185
We got an excuse to pound beers
all night long.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.796
And then,
around 3:00 A.M.,

24:09.839 --> 24:11.188
I'll do
my line-for-line reenactment

24:11.232 --> 24:12.929
of "Good Will Hunting."

24:12.973 --> 24:15.715
Oh, as great
as that sounds, I --Allison.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.107
It's not your fault.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.805
Yeah, I-I know.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.197
It's not your fault,
Allison.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.547
Yes.
No, I understand.

24:21.590 --> 24:22.722
Allison.
It's from the film.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.114
It's not your fault.
Uh-huh.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.203
I mean, see?
How great is that?!

24:26.247 --> 24:28.031
Where else
are you gonna be?

24:28.075 --> 24:29.511
Well,
I have a work --

24:29.555 --> 24:31.905
I have a work
at the package store.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.821
I'll be here.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.518
Waitin' for you.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.303
Oh!
"So will I!"

24:42.219 --> 24:43.699
Oh!

24:45.266 --> 24:46.354
It was his fault!

24:53.230 --> 24:55.929
Hey.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.583
Would you just hold on
one second?

24:57.626 --> 24:58.932
Yeah, sure.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.368
Hey.

25:00.411 --> 25:01.587
Hi.
Oh, my God.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.372
Uh --
S-Sorry. Hi.

25:04.415 --> 25:05.939
So glad
you made it.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.375
Ugh.
Uh,
you look great.

25:07.418 --> 25:10.857
Oh, thank you.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.859
Uh, I-I don't really
know what to do.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.600
I've never been
to one of these before.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.602
Oh, yeah, don't worry.
It's not a big deal.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.734
Um, you've never been
to a meeting?

25:18.778 --> 25:20.170
No.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.868
Do you think
I should have?

25:21.911 --> 25:24.261
No. No, please.
That's not what I meant.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.176
Um, you're the most
self-controlled person

25:26.220 --> 25:27.351
I ever met.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.571
Well,
it's been a while.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.399
Maybe I've changed.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.532
Totally lost it.

25:34.837 --> 25:38.275
Eh,
I'm not buying it.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.018
Okay.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.020
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

25:48.068 --> 25:50.461
<i>The road to Big Trout Lake
is a narrow corridor</i>

25:50.505 --> 25:53.029
<i>filled with twists,
turns, and steep hills...</i>

25:53.073 --> 25:55.466
Mmm. <i>...that make
ordinary runs challenging</i>

25:55.510 --> 25:58.905
<i>and mega-hauls like Todd's
an outright gamble.</i>

25:58.948 --> 26:01.429
Hey, you need the Honda
this week?

26:01.472 --> 26:02.778
Maybe.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.739
I'll let you know.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.916
Oh.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.788
<i>"Bon appétit"</i> means
you can start eating.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.923
Uh...

26:16.966 --> 26:20.448
Can we please just have
some real food?

26:20.491 --> 26:23.494
W-Wha--
Thi-- But this is.

26:23.538 --> 26:26.236
This -- This is --
-This is protein and vegetables.
-No, Kurt.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.458
I would like some real-ass food,
you know?

26:30.501 --> 26:32.242
With carbs
and animal fat

26:32.286 --> 26:33.679
so I don't have to
keep speed-eating

26:33.722 --> 26:35.942
alone in my car
on the way over here.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.684
It's lonely
and I'm getting heartburn.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.382
Yeah, o-okay.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.079
I'll order something.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.951
Thank you!

26:44.994 --> 26:46.953
Yes, God!
Thank you!

26:51.522 --> 26:54.569
Ooh,
maybe chimichangas!

26:56.310 --> 26:58.704
Once again,
welcome to the Sunday Trinity

26:58.747 --> 27:03.622
Big Book Discussion Meeting
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.755
I've stated
that I'm an alcoholic.

27:06.799 --> 27:10.280
Are there any other alcoholics
present tonight?

27:10.324 --> 27:14.284
We also celebrate the
anniversaries at this meeting.

27:14.328 --> 27:18.549
An anniversary is defined
as 365 days free of alcohol

27:18.593 --> 27:21.770
or anything else that
affects you from the neck up.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.903
We have one anniversary tonight,

27:23.946 --> 27:26.688
and that is Sam,
celebrating eight years.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.994
Get up here, Sam.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.702
Hey, I'm Sam.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.182
Alcoholic.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.750
--Hi, Sam.Hi, Sam.
-Hi, Sam.
-Hi, Sam.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.752
Uh, I dragged myself
into the Program

27:46.795 --> 27:49.189
when I finally hit rock bottom.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.582
One night, I got so loaded

27:51.626 --> 27:55.804
that I stole a bundle of heroin
from some guy I met at a bar --

27:55.848 --> 27:58.198
too drunk to even remember
his name.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.852
Jason, maybe?

27:59.895 --> 28:04.378
If he'd caught me,
I bet he would've killed me.

28:04.421 --> 28:07.598
I can still feel that fear
and that shame, and that's good.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.818
It keeps the cycle
from starting again.

28:09.862 --> 28:14.562
I've been done with destructive
patterns for eight years.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.217
I'm not going back.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.796
Oh.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.059
Um, thank you so much
for having me.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.843
Really?
This -- Yeah.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.759
Uh, I know these things
can be painful.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.066
Oddly, I'm, uh --
I'm proud.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.415
I --
Sam.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.330
Oh, hey!
Hey.

28:43.373 --> 28:44.635
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, I wanted
to surprise you.

28:44.679 --> 28:45.985
Did I miss it?

28:46.028 --> 28:48.074
Yeah, but that's okay.
There's plenty more.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.772
My dad was at the house
looking at tile samples,

28:50.816 --> 28:52.513
and I lost track
of time.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.167
-Sorry.
-Eh,
that's okay.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.646
House looks great though.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.519
Good.
Uh, Jenn, this is Allison.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.825
Allison,
my wife, Jenn.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.740
-Hi.
-Hi. Oh.
Hi.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.785
Uh, we've actually
met before.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.048
I, uh, worked with Sam
in high school.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.397
Oh, how sweet of you
to come.

29:07.441 --> 29:08.703
Of course.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.879
It's a big deal.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.665
Sorry, you got, um --
You have something.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.233
Oh.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.629
Is that a bean?

29:21.672 --> 29:23.109
A pinto bean.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.111
It's, uh --
It's from a chili.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.460
Oh.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.903
Um, anyway...

30:09.459 --> 30:11.461
Hello.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.864
I can't do it!
What?

30:22.908 --> 30:24.910
I can't hurt him!

30:24.953 --> 30:28.087
You cooked him over a fire
all night long.

30:28.130 --> 30:30.263
That was different.
This is murder!

30:32.221 --> 30:35.921
We had a totally
life-changing night together.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.140
You and
the already-dead pig?

30:38.184 --> 30:39.750
Don't say it
like that.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.491
You don't know.
You weren't here.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.799
I slept here.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.148
But you were late.

30:46.192 --> 30:47.933
You totally missed
the connection I had

30:47.976 --> 30:50.544
with this
beautiful creature.

30:50.587 --> 30:53.547
We talked about real
big-picture stuff, you know?

30:53.590 --> 30:55.636
Life. Love.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.768
How dudes who say
they don't pee in the shower

30:57.812 --> 30:59.553
are definitely lying.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.686
Do you pee
in the shower?

31:02.730 --> 31:04.210
No.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.561
Look,
the point is,

31:07.604 --> 31:09.519
there's no way that
I can cut up my best friend!

31:09.563 --> 31:12.522
Ok-- Do you think that this
might possibly be about Neil?

31:12.566 --> 31:14.263
Of course not.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.223
This is about my new friend,
Piggy Stardust.

31:19.051 --> 31:22.968
And worse -- about how,
now I'm completely screwed

31:23.011 --> 31:24.795
because I got no meat
for the chili!

31:24.839 --> 31:27.233
Just give them
vegetarian chili.

31:27.276 --> 31:30.540
Vegetarian chili is worse
than no chili at all.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.238
Nobody wants salad soup!

31:32.281 --> 31:34.240
Well, then,
you'll just be

31:34.283 --> 31:36.024
the laughing stock
of the whole neighborhood.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.200
You're right.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.636
Oh.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.116
I won't be able
to leave the house.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.813
That's it.

31:42.857 --> 31:46.426
I'm gonna become
a Kermit.
A "Kermit"?

31:46.469 --> 31:49.168
Yeah -- someone who's alone
and inside all the time.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.561
Like Kermit always hiding
from Miss Piggy.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.609
This is when
you feel humiliation?

31:55.652 --> 31:57.959
You definitely pee
in our shower.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.266
I'm never
leaving this house again,

32:00.309 --> 32:03.312
and you're gonna be here
right by my side the whole time.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.272
In it
till we kick it, baby!

32:06.315 --> 32:07.664
Lucky you.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.363
So lucky.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.843
Alright,
I'm gonna go upstairs

32:12.887 --> 32:15.585
and stew this out
over a bath.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.025
You're gonna have to come up
in 45

32:20.068 --> 32:22.201
with a beer
-and a sandwich.
-Oh--

32:22.244 --> 32:24.420
Not that
I need anyone!

32:40.871 --> 32:44.049
It's a dangerous thing,
falsely accusing someone --

32:44.092 --> 32:46.312
especially a guy high up
in the community.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.053
Good job,
family.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.707
Might as well accuse
Father O'Donnell

32:50.751 --> 32:51.795
of peddling pills.

32:51.839 --> 32:53.884
So, please,
keep in mind,

32:53.928 --> 32:55.408
if you're
full of crap,

32:55.451 --> 32:57.801
no one would think twice
about sending you to Walpole.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.673
And I'll tell my
friends over there that
you touch little kids.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.895
I swear
on my mother's life,

33:04.939 --> 33:06.810
this is the guy
you're looking for, okay?

33:06.854 --> 33:08.073
Who am I?
I'm nobody.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.726
Whoever ratted me out,
like --

33:09.770 --> 33:11.902
Listen, pal, the amount of stuff
you got caught with,

33:11.946 --> 33:13.730
that's an intent
to distribute.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.341
Forget intent
to distribute.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.430
It's like Black Friday
in there.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.955
Yeah,
we'll see.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.138
If you have
any questions, give me a call.

33:31.574 --> 33:33.794
Hey, buddy.

33:34.882 --> 33:36.362
How can I help you?

33:36.405 --> 33:38.364
Uh, it's Monday.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.540
I'm here
for the generics.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.672
You're not
supposed to call.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.674
I know.
I know, I'm sorry.

33:44.718 --> 33:47.199
It was a huge mistake.
It won't happen again.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.552
Terrance.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.075
Please.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.254
Thank you,
Terrance.

33:59.298 --> 34:02.301
I love you,
Terrance.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.436
Oh. Hey.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.003
Hey.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.831
Back for
more Lipitor, huh?

34:12.137 --> 34:14.791
Maybe it's all those,
uh, carbs and animal fat.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.274
S--
Listen, last night,

34:19.318 --> 34:21.972
I think
I just got confused, right?

34:22.016 --> 34:23.148
Because we had -

34:23.191 --> 34:24.975
Worcester PD!

34:25.019 --> 34:28.153
Everybody stay
where you are.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.155
Sir, put your hands
behind your back.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.765
Don't move.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.419
You're under arrest.

34:33.462 --> 34:35.377
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:35.421 --> 34:36.987
Anything you say can and will
be used --

34:43.037 --> 34:45.431
Well, they say witnesses
can't leave

34:45.474 --> 34:48.173
for another 45,
at least, so...

34:48.216 --> 34:51.219
Great.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.742
Oh, here.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.310
I'm not cold.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.877
Okay.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.885
That was insane.

35:04.928 --> 35:07.148
It was terrifying.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.847
Yeah.

35:10.891 --> 35:14.242
It reminded me of this one
4th of July when I was a kid.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.636
I couldn't have been
more than 3,

35:16.679 --> 35:20.466
and my parents took me into town
to see the fireworks.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.642
Dad put me up
on his shoulders.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.252
They started up --

35:24.296 --> 35:27.777
these huge explosions
right above us.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.215
I remember thinking,
like,

35:30.258 --> 35:33.043
"The world
is on fire."

35:33.087 --> 35:36.046
Sound hit me in my chest.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.787
Smoke was
in my eyes.

35:37.831 --> 35:40.225
Everybody just laughing
and smiling.

35:40.268 --> 35:43.793
Like,
they didn't understand.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.362
This was the end.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.931
Kurt, what the hell
are you doing?

35:50.974 --> 35:52.628
Being that close
to death

35:52.672 --> 35:55.501
makes you think --
really --

35:55.544 --> 35:57.677
about what's important

35:57.720 --> 36:00.767
and what
you can't live without.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.334
And, Patty...

36:03.683 --> 36:05.163
Oh.

36:05.206 --> 36:08.601
I can't live without you
a-and your chimichangas.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.830
Okay,
it's Monday.

36:20.874 --> 36:22.832
Time...

36:22.876 --> 36:25.835
Whoa.
You okay?

36:25.879 --> 36:27.272
Rough morning.

36:27.315 --> 36:29.839
Ye-- Well, I guess that,
but, how?

36:29.883 --> 36:31.232
What happened?
You okay?

36:32.625 --> 36:35.628
Okay, what's with
all the questions all the time?

36:35.671 --> 36:39.153
I-- W-- I don't ask you stuff
to piss you off.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.547
I just want
to know the answers.

36:44.593 --> 36:45.899
Why?

36:46.943 --> 36:48.554
Because...

36:48.597 --> 36:51.252
uh, I thought I knew
your whole thing.

36:52.688 --> 36:55.430
We practically spent
the last 10 years

36:55.474 --> 36:56.910
in the same room,

36:56.953 --> 36:58.303
but no one knows
that I'm buying drugs,

36:58.346 --> 36:59.869
and I'm guessing
that no one knows

36:59.913 --> 37:02.089
that you're
selling them.

37:02.132 --> 37:05.310
Unless Kurt's some kind of
secret drug mule.

37:06.746 --> 37:08.574
No.

37:08.617 --> 37:11.881
He has no idea.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.324
If he did,

37:19.367 --> 37:25.330
he probably wouldn't have,
like, proposed.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.854
Wha-- Ser--

37:31.901 --> 37:33.729
Seriously?

37:35.165 --> 37:36.732
Yeah.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.343
Ooh.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.824
Um, what does
the ring look like?

37:41.868 --> 37:43.304
There was no ring.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.915
It was in the parking lot
of the pharmacy.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.613
That --

37:47.656 --> 37:48.962
Hmm.

37:49.005 --> 37:50.703
Yeah, m-minutes after
we were caught

37:50.746 --> 37:52.922
in the middle
of a drug raid.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.794
At the pharmacy?

37:54.837 --> 37:56.622
Was that your --

37:56.665 --> 38:00.190
Yep, my friend was hauled off
in a pair of handcuffs

38:00.234 --> 38:03.368
and my stash is
in an evidence bag somewhere.

38:03.411 --> 38:06.284
And that's when
Kurt decided to propose.

38:07.981 --> 38:11.593
Okay, uh, so, does that mean
that y-you're --

38:11.637 --> 38:14.161
I'm out.
Dry. No pills.

38:14.204 --> 38:16.294
Nothing.
God damn it.

38:16.337 --> 38:18.687
Well, hey,
it's not my fault.

38:20.472 --> 38:21.951
Blame the corner-kid-asshole
at the auto body

38:21.995 --> 38:23.344
who got arrested

38:23.388 --> 38:26.042
and gave up
the area's only supplier.

38:27.435 --> 38:28.828
Maybe this is good.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.656
This whole s--
like, selling this shit --

38:30.699 --> 38:31.744
it's too much trouble.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.311
Bu-- No.

38:33.354 --> 38:34.616
I was close
to going off the rails.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.271
My hair's startin' to break
from the stress.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.403
Hey, we can't
give up on this.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.013
Okay?

38:40.056 --> 38:42.972
I-I can't deal with
going home right now,

38:43.016 --> 38:46.585
so, um, why don't we
grab a bite and --

38:46.628 --> 38:50.066
real food --
and just talk about it?

38:51.503 --> 38:53.461
I have to get home to Neil.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.420
When he deep-fried
the turkey,

38:55.463 --> 38:58.379
it exploded
and burnt up his arms.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.425
This goddamn chili.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.557
He didn't even
make the chili.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.429
Just a pile
of deep-fried turkey

39:04.472 --> 39:06.431
sittin' on
the kitchen counter.

39:06.474 --> 39:09.303
I can smell it
from downstairs.

39:12.741 --> 39:16.528
I think I know how to make
both our lives easier.

39:18.878 --> 39:21.359
We just have to make them think
that it's their --

39:21.402 --> 39:23.012
...brilliant idea
to merge ingredients.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.625
My lame-ass batch
of vegetarian stew...

39:26.668 --> 39:29.323
And my gorgeous pile
of manly meat.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.238
Into the greatest
friendship chili

39:31.281 --> 39:32.718
this world
has ever tasted.

39:32.761 --> 39:34.372
Well, I gotta give this
a little test.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.721
W-- No, no, no, no.
Pete, I love you,

39:35.764 --> 39:37.462
but you smell like the pellets
at a petting zoo,

39:37.505 --> 39:39.812
and I need you to stay
five feet away from the chili.

39:41.335 --> 39:42.423
Well,
how is that okay?

39:42.467 --> 39:44.120
Because it's my chili.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.471
I'm sorry.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.037
<i>Our</i> chili.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.430
I'm so glad
we were both man enough to admit

39:49.474 --> 39:50.953
we need each other.

39:50.997 --> 39:54.043
-In a totally normal way.
-In a totally normal way.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.045
You ask me, you could both
do with some more time apart.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.482
-No.
-No, no, no.

39:57.525 --> 40:00.354
No, he --
Kevin needs a Neil.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.486
We've already
begun planning

40:01.529 --> 40:03.183
to make up
for the lost goofin' time.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.490
Yeah, water balloon fight.
Then, "Ace Ventura" marathon

40:05.533 --> 40:07.970
followed by one of our
epic games of hide and seek.

40:08.014 --> 40:10.538
Allison, you might not see me
for the next 24 hours.

40:10.582 --> 40:12.540
Oh, no!

40:12.584 --> 40:15.282
But first, let's get this chili
to the Renzulli Brothers.

40:15.325 --> 40:16.675
To the Kev-mobile!

40:16.718 --> 40:18.503
Let's go.

40:18.546 --> 40:19.765
Come on.
Left.
Ow. Ow.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.070
Left.
Ow.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.290
Left.
Keep going.
Ow!

40:26.206 --> 40:28.121
It's looking at me.

40:28.164 --> 40:30.558
Yeah,
it does that.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.997
So, I guess they just assume
you'll clean it up.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.173
Okay, what are we gonna do
about this?

40:38.566 --> 40:41.787
Chainsaw?
N--
I mean the pills.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.093
Listen, Allison, I already
told you at the salon.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.487
I'm out, okay?
Patty,
you don't understand.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.315
I need this,
and you're m--

40:48.358 --> 40:49.795
the only one
that can help.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.361
Okay,
you know what?

40:51.405 --> 40:53.407
We're sharing so much now?
You like answers?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.104
So do I.

40:55.148 --> 40:57.367
Why do you
actually need these?

40:57.411 --> 40:59.021
What the hell's been
going on with you?

40:59.065 --> 41:02.111
I just...

41:02.155 --> 41:05.767
I'm in
a really bad place.

41:05.811 --> 41:08.814
The night that you told me
that Kevin drained the account,

41:08.857 --> 41:11.120
I lost it.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.819
I went on a bender.

41:13.862 --> 41:16.125
That powder
that you wiped off my face,

41:16.169 --> 41:18.127
that was coke.

41:18.171 --> 41:19.564
"Cain."

41:19.607 --> 41:21.740
Ye--
I know what you meant.

41:21.783 --> 41:24.003
Somethin' in me
just snapped,

41:24.046 --> 41:27.572
and I made
this decision.

41:27.615 --> 41:30.226
I don't know
if I should tell you.

41:35.449 --> 41:40.149
Um,
I got blackout drunk,

41:40.193 --> 41:41.847
and apparently,

41:41.890 --> 41:44.414
I stole a bunch of oxys
from this guy at a bar.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.591
I was so drunk,
I don't even remember his name.

41:46.634 --> 41:49.419
It was, um,
Jason, maybe.

41:49.463 --> 41:51.596
And they must be
hard to get,

41:51.639 --> 41:52.858
because he won't take money
for them,

41:52.901 --> 41:57.602
and he said that I g--
I'd better get more.

41:57.645 --> 42:01.388
Patty, I screwed up,
and I'm scared.

42:01.431 --> 42:03.259
Please.

42:06.436 --> 42:09.178
Okay. I--

42:09.222 --> 42:11.441
I got no guarantee.

42:11.485 --> 42:15.271
But I may have a connection
in Vermont.

42:15.315 --> 42:16.882
I'll make
-a few phone calls.
-Oh, thank you.

42:16.925 --> 42:18.318
Well,
don't thank me yet.

42:18.361 --> 42:20.886
I mean, if this works,
I'll go up there soon.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.627
But even if
I get anything,

42:22.670 --> 42:24.367
I'm using
this pipeline once, okay?

42:24.411 --> 42:26.065
Of course,
of course.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.457
I'll get your stuff

42:27.501 --> 42:28.633
and enough
to wean my clients off,

42:28.676 --> 42:30.199
and then,
I'm done.

42:30.243 --> 42:31.723
Yes, sure.

42:31.766 --> 42:34.290
And I think
you should come with me.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.207
Really?

42:39.861 --> 42:41.210
I need a car.

42:41.254 --> 42:42.777
You can
borrow Kevin's.

42:44.083 --> 42:45.824
Oh. Okay.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.652
Yeah, okay.

42:47.695 --> 42:50.045
We'll --
We'll go together.
