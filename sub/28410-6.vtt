09:12.093 --> 09:13.594

09:13.678 --> 09:15.680
{\an8}(voice breaking):
went wrong.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.516
{\an8}We just never envisioned we'd be
the ones wondering about them.

09:18.599 --> 09:22.937
{\an8}TINA: TMI burn shutoff

09:23.020 --> 09:24.855
{\an8}Our options--

09:24.939 --> 09:26.857
{\an8}we orbit Earth
the rest of our lives,

09:26.941 --> 09:29.360
{\an8}burn up in the atmosphere
when our fuel runs out.

09:29.443 --> 09:30.987
{\an8}Food will run out
before the fuel.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.822

through the command module.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.574

for a water landing.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.994

09:38.077 --> 09:40.079
{\an9}BRANDT:
So we go.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.332
{\an9}We travel the 218 days

We'd die there.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.673
{\an8}Yeah, we'd die of cancer and
prolonged radiation exposure

09:50.756 --> 09:53.342
{\an9}before we could have the
chance to refine enough fuel.

09:53.426 --> 09:58.097
{\an8}There's a test to the universe.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.852
A scientific theory,
made by an economist,

10:02.935 --> 10:05.021
known as "The Great Filter."

10:06.772 --> 10:08.357
The Great Filter posits

10:08.441 --> 10:12.695
that life in the universe
is very, very rare.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.698
It's hard to start,
harder to continue.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.950
The test of life

10:18.034 --> 10:21.370
is, "Can an advanced
life-form make it

10:21.454 --> 10:23.831
to another planet
before it destroys itself?"

10:25.958 --> 10:28.753
Most advanced life fails.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.965
{\an3}That's why we never encounter
any other civilizations.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.679
They destroy themselves
before we can reach 'em.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.394
Humans... Earth...

10:45.478 --> 10:47.605
we're on the brink.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.733
This mission was designed

10:50.816 --> 10:54.612
because we had no choice
but to find a way out.

10:54.695 --> 10:59.909
{\an5}TINA: TMI burn shutoff
in E-minus five minutes.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.953
We go, and we go together.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.164
If we remain who we are,

11:05.247 --> 11:07.708
hold on
to the group's original goal,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.127
to the world's goal for us,

11:10.211 --> 11:12.588
{\an3}if we stick to what we
believed would get us there

11:12.671 --> 11:14.757
over the last four years--

11:14.840 --> 11:18.427
the stuff that makes us
a family-- I know we'll be okay.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.929
(sniffles)

11:20.012 --> 11:21.889
And if anyone is alive at home,

11:21.972 --> 11:24.642
maybe word will get out
that we made it.

11:24.725 --> 11:29.563
They can look up and see Mars,
and have hope for themselves.

26:30.547 --> 26:34.301
<i>All my family's there.</i>

26:34.384 --> 26:36.303
And then I realize,

26:36.386 --> 26:38.638
in the dream,

26:38.722 --> 26:40.640
that I'm just dreaming,

26:40.724 --> 26:43.310
{\an1}that I'm
not really there.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.979
I don't want
to wake up.

26:46.062 --> 26:48.398
But I do.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.028
This...

26:53.111 --> 26:55.363
is the nightmare.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.366
You're not alone.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.368
We're in this.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.415
You're our commander.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.253
We're a family,
and we need our mum.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.718
You're the mom.

27:16.801 --> 27:21.598
I'm commander of nothing
but a slow suicide.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.808
Hmm?

(gasping)

35:58.823 --> 36:00.575
(alarm blaring)

36:00.658 --> 36:02.785
My hypothesis is such
that the events on this ship

36:02.869 --> 36:06.747
are the result of an endurance
simulation experiment

36:06.831 --> 36:08.791
meant to test crew morale

36:08.875 --> 36:10.710
and mental durability
during a trip to Mars.

36:10.793 --> 36:14.046
Unlike other such experiments,
we were not informed

36:14.130 --> 36:16.173
in order to get
a truer result.

36:16.257 --> 36:19.844
Okay, to test my hypothesis,
first, I made a calculation.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.096
{\an1}The probability
of a North Korean missile launch

36:22.179 --> 36:23.598
{\an1}just 20 minutes prior
to the launch

36:23.681 --> 36:24.932
{\an5}of the <i> Bradbury...</i>

36:23.681 --> 36:24.932
Jerry...

36:25.016 --> 36:28.936
The result was 735.6

36:29.020 --> 36:32.064
{\an5}<i>billion,</i> with a "B."

36:29.020 --> 36:32.064
TINA: Exposure levels fatal.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.608
{\an5}BRANDT: Pierson! Langford!

36:32.148 --> 36:33.608
{\an1}PIERSON: So, essentially,
an impossibility.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.276
Tanaka! Secure yourselves

36:35.359 --> 36:37.153
{\an5}in the flight deck!

36:35.359 --> 36:37.153
So the most likely
explanation is

36:37.236 --> 36:40.239
that we never launched.
(chuckles)

36:40.323 --> 36:41.741
{\an3}While we were
boarding the ship,

36:41.824 --> 36:43.743
we were redirected
in the launch tower tunnel

36:43.826 --> 36:44.911
to a <i> replica</i>

36:44.994 --> 36:45.912
<i>Bradbury</i> housed

36:45.995 --> 36:47.997
{\an3}in a facility on the
Whipple Spaceport campus.

36:48.080 --> 36:48.873
Jerry, we have to get
to the cockpit.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.917
Growing suspicious
just after launch,

36:51.000 --> 36:52.752
I was prescient enough
to conduct an experiment

36:52.835 --> 36:55.087
{\an5}just prior to TMI.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.087
Pierson, sit the fuck down, man!

36:55.171 --> 36:56.756
Jerry, I understand, and
you are making complete sense.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.633
{\an1}But can you tell me
from your flight seat?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.801
{\an5}TINA:
O2 fans disabled.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.639
I held a tablet stylus
in the air and released it.

37:04.722 --> 37:05.306
See? Rei.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.682
{\an3}(chuckles)
If it floated,

37:06.766 --> 37:07.934
then we <i> were</i> in orbit

37:08.017 --> 37:09.644
{\an5}and not in a simulation.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.644
{\an1}Jerry,

37:09.727 --> 37:10.853
you are endangering everyone.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.396
You have to get
to your flight seat.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.065
{\an1}Standing by
for a 90-degree

37:14.148 --> 37:15.650
{\an5}roll maneuver!

37:14.148 --> 37:15.650
BRANDT: Shit.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.652
Pierson,
get in your fucking chair now!

37:17.735 --> 37:19.987
Against my expectations,

37:20.071 --> 37:22.323
the stylus demonstrated the
properties of weightlessness.

{\an5}TINA: Solar flare impact
in E-minus 273 seconds.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.660
So,

37:25.743 --> 37:26.827
{\an3}obviously,

37:26.911 --> 37:28.287
we are housed in

37:28.371 --> 37:30.957
a six degrees
of freedom simulator.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.627
We're capable of performing
the six types of motion possible

37:34.710 --> 37:36.170
by a rigid body
in three-dimensional space.

37:36.253 --> 37:38.130
Surge. Heave. Sway.
Yaw. Pitch. Roll.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.341
{\an5}Initiating heat shield.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.341
{\an3}All of this
against our wills

37:40.424 --> 37:43.177
or even our knowledge.
Now, I remain uncertain

37:43.260 --> 37:45.721
{\an1}at which point they redirected
us into the replica.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.306
{\an1}In the tunnel to the launch pad
is most likely.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.308
{\an1}But with a simulation
this sophisticated,

37:49.392 --> 37:51.268
who knows how long
we've been unaware?

37:51.352 --> 37:52.853
Jerry, I understand.
And I believe you, okay?

37:52.937 --> 37:53.854
I believe you...

37:53.938 --> 37:54.814
No, fuck you!

37:54.897 --> 37:56.691

37:56.774 --> 37:58.025
You don't believe me!

37:58.109 --> 37:59.986
{\an3}You want me to do
what they want.

38:00.069 --> 38:05.157
{\an1}They made us think
that our families are dead!

38:05.241 --> 38:07.868
They made us think
that the Earth was destroyed.

38:07.952 --> 38:11.414
They fucked with eight months
of our lives,

38:11.497 --> 38:13.416

Unable to stop ET liquid leak.

38:44.613 --> 38:46.449

38:44.613 --> 38:46.449
This toilet has

38:46.532 --> 38:49.035
a disposal device comprised
of plastic collection bags,

38:49.118 --> 38:50.870
which, although tied up
and stored for ejection

38:50.953 --> 38:52.204
into the vacuum of space,

38:52.288 --> 38:53.914
{\an5}consistently released

38:52.288 --> 38:53.914
Jerry, please!

38:53.998 --> 38:55.041

which, over a 12-week period
of approximately

39:01.005 --> 39:02.548
{\an1}five to ten fecal collections
a day, thus five to ten

39:02.631 --> 39:03.382

There's nothing.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.948
Heat shield repositioned.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.241
There is nothing!

39:29.325 --> 39:32.411
I took samples for 105 days

39:32.495 --> 39:35.289
with my bare fucking hands,

39:35.373 --> 39:38.167
and there has never been a ring!

39:38.250 --> 39:39.126
All right, there has

39:39.210 --> 39:40.294
never been condensation!

39:40.377 --> 39:41.962
