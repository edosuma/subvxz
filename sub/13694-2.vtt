will you just shut up

00:16.508 --> 00:18.760
There's a bomb

00:43.702 --> 00:46.163
Well, what's the verdict?

00:46.246 --> 00:48.707
A blast like that would have
demolished most houses.

00:48.790 --> 00:51.418
Well, but Glenbogle
isn't most houses, is it?

00:51.501 --> 00:52.961
That's the problem.

00:53.045 --> 00:55.297
I don't get
to deal with places
this size that often.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.257
It's gonna take time
to assess the damage.

00:57.341 --> 00:58.967
Yeah, but we can
still stay here?

00:59.051 --> 01:01.637
No. I can't guarantee
your safety.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.013
You'll have to move out.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.806
For how long?

01:04.890 --> 01:06.308
Depends on what we find.

01:06.391 --> 01:08.518
How are we going to run

it's that serious as all that.

Well, he's letting us
stay here for free. (SNIFFS)

give him some time off.

he's gonna make
a career out of it,

have agreed to it.

supported you.

he's done for Glenbogle.

-That wasn't his fault.

of publicity, eh?

really have a look at it.

Um, but if it's closed,
well, never mind.

08:37.259 --> 08:39.094
Well,

08:39.177 --> 08:42.222
seeing as you're
my guests,

08:42.306 --> 08:44.265
I might be able
to get you into it.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.268
I mean, I can't
promise anything.

08:46.351 --> 08:49.646
Well, if we don't see it,
it won't go in the book.

would suit us.

We could do
with some more pancakes.

I'm sorry this all has to be
so cloak-and-dagger.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.412
Don't you think
it would be better
if you told Archie?

09:05.495 --> 09:07.831
No, he'd be mortified.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.666
It's not as if we're doing
anything wrong.

want him to teach me.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.832
Oh, we will certainly
want to see
the rest of the house.

09:50.916 --> 09:52.417
Uh, you said just the kitchen.

09:52.501 --> 09:54.711
Oh, no, no, we will want
to take photographs.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.672
Of the whole house.

09:56.755 --> 10:00.175
We might even
want to film here for
our television programme.

10:00.258 --> 10:01.927
You mean it might be
on the TV?

10:02.010 --> 10:03.804
Of course.

10:03.887 --> 10:08.100
Now, why don't you go
and find the chef
for us to talk to

10:08.183 --> 10:10.811
while we take a look around?

10:10.894 --> 10:12.354
You want a chef?

10:12.437 --> 10:15.482
The food doesn't cook itself,
does it?

10:15.565 --> 10:16.650
No.

10:19.945 --> 10:21.446
I'm the chef.

10:21.530 --> 10:23.490
Oh! How on earth
do you manage
to run this kitchen

10:23.573 --> 10:24.992
and your bed and breakfast?

10:25.075 --> 10:26.868
Um, Boutique Hotel.

10:26.952 --> 10:30.122
There is a lot
of running around,
to and fro.

10:30.205 --> 10:31.290
I see.

10:31.373 --> 10:33.959
And what's
your favourite dish?

10:34.042 --> 10:36.086
Uh, good question.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.462
I, uh...

10:39.673 --> 10:43.719
This one,
with the wee flowers on.

10:43.802 --> 10:48.557
If you are the chef,
maybe you could
cook us some lunch.

10:48.640 --> 10:52.561
-Uh, you're probably
not that hungry yet, eh?
-Oh, we are.

10:52.644 --> 10:54.938
Why don't you, um,

10:55.022 --> 10:57.816
cook us up
a little amuse-gueule

10:57.899 --> 10:59.943
while we take a look around?

11:00.027 --> 11:02.237
Margot, camera.

11:02.321 --> 11:04.823
Now, there is absolutely
no need to rush.

11:04.906 --> 11:07.784
We'll be taking
lots of snaps for research.

11:08.577 --> 11:09.620
Good idea.

-Bye.
-Bye.

11:18.295 --> 11:19.463
Are you feeling any better?

11:19.546 --> 11:22.549
Yes. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to shout.

11:22.633 --> 11:25.052
Seventy is quite fast
for this kind of road.

11:25.135 --> 11:26.720
Well, there's something
about being with you

11:26.803 --> 11:29.514
just makes me
want to drive fast,
you know.

11:29.598 --> 11:33.143

Does that sound stupid?

11:33.226 --> 11:35.896
Not at all. I'm flattered.

11:35.979 --> 11:39.858
You've done so much for me.
Not just the driving.
Everything.

11:44.655 --> 11:48.033
Better get going. I promise
I won't drive too fast.

11:51.203 --> 11:52.245
How's Andrew?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.417
Andrew?

11:57.501 --> 11:59.169
Yeah, you were on the back
of his motorbike.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.296
Oh! Oh, Andrew!

12:02.422 --> 12:06.843
He's, um... He's very well,
thank you.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.805
Um, I don't really know
how to say this.

12:09.888 --> 12:11.723
Uh, but I...
I do realise that,

12:11.807 --> 12:14.851
in time, you might want
to see other people.

12:15.644 --> 12:17.604
Men, I mean.

12:17.688 --> 12:21.358
As friends, or whatever.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.443
And... And Lexie and I,
we understand that.

12:23.527 --> 12:25.821
I mean, we can't expect you
to be a sort
of Greyfriars Bobby

good job at that already.

This is very kind
of you, Archie,

12:33.370 --> 12:34.955
but I hadn't really thought
I needed your permission.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.419
That went well.

12:51.596 --> 12:54.433
I heard the news
about Glenbogle.

12:54.516 --> 12:57.519
Still, every cloud
has a silver lining!

12:57.602 --> 12:59.938
I've been de-cluttering
Lord Kilwillie's wardrobes,

13:00.022 --> 13:02.107
and Archie
probably needs clothes.

13:02.190 --> 13:03.233
If you could see
that he gets them.

13:04.318 --> 13:06.153
Um, thanks very much.

13:06.236 --> 13:08.363
Things must be grim
at Glenbogle.

I'm Lady Dorothy

of Kilwillie Castle.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.107
You must visit.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.484
We'd be delighted.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.612
Uh, no. You've got
your house for the region.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.490
Come for coffee tomorrow.

13:51.573 --> 13:54.785
Glenbogle may have
a certain quirky charm,

13:54.868 --> 13:58.664
but Kilwillie Castle
has undisputed class.

13:58.747 --> 14:01.041
-No, they can't...
-We'd be delighted!

14:03.752 --> 14:04.878
(SIGHS)

14:35.033 --> 14:36.201
Hello?

14:38.620 --> 14:39.871
Hello...

14:41.748 --> 14:43.041
(CLATTER)

14:50.882 --> 14:52.384
Uh, excuse me?

14:55.721 --> 14:57.306
(SIGHS) Paul!

15:01.768 --> 15:03.729
(VACUUM CLEANER DRONES)

15:05.897 --> 15:07.566
Duncan, go away!

15:11.069 --> 15:12.321
Sorry.

15:12.404 --> 15:14.531
He's been driving me mad
all day.

15:14.615 --> 15:16.533
There's not a square inch
of carpet out there

15:16.617 --> 15:19.161
that he hasn't hoovered
at least twice already
this afternoon.

15:19.244 --> 15:21.747
No chance
of getting him back
to do his real job, then?

15:21.830 --> 15:23.624
I'll be up and about
in a couple of days.

15:23.707 --> 15:26.501
But if you are not,
there is no plan B, is there?

15:26.585 --> 15:29.254
Well, there's not much
of a plan A.

15:29.338 --> 15:30.797
The kind of bad luck
we've been having,

15:30.881 --> 15:32.424
it's pretty difficult
to plan anything.

15:32.507 --> 15:36.178
Well, I would've said
we had a streak
of good luck lately.

15:36.261 --> 15:39.723
What would have happened
if you'd been killed
in that explosion?

15:39.806 --> 15:42.225
Wild celebrations
in the streets
of Glenbogle?

15:42.309 --> 15:44.436
I'm being serious, Archie.

15:46.438 --> 15:47.981
Okay, I get the message.

15:48.940 --> 15:50.776
Right.

15:50.859 --> 15:52.361
Anyway, that's not
why I'm here.

15:52.444 --> 15:55.739
Lexie says you needed
a lift to the pub.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.658
-Do I?
-She wants us all there.

15:57.741 --> 15:59.993
She's got a surprise for us.

16:07.459 --> 16:09.711
I don't understand this.
All day long, you tell me
I have to rest.

16:09.795 --> 16:11.296
All of a sudden,
I have to come here.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.632
I've got a surprise for you.

16:15.676 --> 16:17.010
This is a very bad idea.

16:17.094 --> 16:18.261
-I'd like to go home,
now, please.
-(SIGHS)

16:18.345 --> 16:21.431
The karaoke is not
the surprise. Come on.

16:28.522 --> 16:29.523
ARCHIE: What's going on?

16:30.649 --> 16:32.067
Behind you.

16:35.821 --> 16:36.947
Paul.

16:37.406 --> 16:38.657
Archie.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.617
Well! We'll have to kill
the fatted calf

16:40.701 --> 16:43.245
and give you a proper
Glenbogle welcome.

16:43.328 --> 16:45.539
You'll find that some
of our old Highland customs

16:45.622 --> 16:48.959
involve violence
and livestock.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.961
Well, where have you been?
You should have phoned.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.547
Yeah. I'm sorry.

16:53.630 --> 16:56.008
Look, uh, I know
it's a bit of a cheek,

16:56.091 --> 16:57.968
but, um...

16:58.051 --> 17:01.471
Well, I was hoping to
come and stay up here.

17:01.555 --> 17:02.848
Well, how long
are you on leave for?

17:02.931 --> 17:04.391
I'm not.

17:04.473 --> 17:06.435
I... I've left the Army.

17:06.518 --> 17:09.104
-You've left?
-Yeah, about a week ago.

17:09.186 --> 17:10.439
I, uh...

17:12.566 --> 17:13.775
Okay, here we go.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.611
Uh, I'd like to come
and live up here.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.574
Hold on a minute.
What, come and live with us?

17:21.532 --> 17:23.242
If you'll have me.

17:28.373 --> 17:31.001
-Are you all right?
-Of course.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.586
That was my whisky.

17:32.669 --> 17:36.840
I'll stay in the camper van
just until I get
myself sorted out.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.383
And what are you
gonna do about work?

17:38.467 --> 17:40.052
Well, I... I did have
one or two ideas, actually.

17:40.135 --> 17:42.137
Which we can discuss tomorrow.

17:42.220 --> 17:46.475
We're supposed
to be celebrating tonight.
So, who's up for a duet?

17:46.558 --> 17:49.144
-Archie?
-Archie doesn't do karaoke.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.606
-That leaves me, then.
-Come on.

18:00.237 --> 18:02.031
-Thank you.
-Plan B?

18:02.658 --> 18:03.866
Paul?

18:03.951 --> 18:06.620
Well, he can give me a hand
while you're laid up.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.211
(WHISPERS) Did you know
Paul was coming to visit?

18:14.294 --> 18:16.380
Um, it's not a visit. I think
we wants to live with us.

(FEEDBACK WHINING)

18:41.196 --> 18:43.448
Paul showing up like this.

18:43.532 --> 18:45.534
I don't want to talk about it.

18:45.617 --> 18:47.369
Yes, you do.

18:47.452 --> 18:50.080
I've never seen you
this upset.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.582
I don't want him
to live with us.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.668
(SIGHS) I know
Hector was unfaithful,

18:54.751 --> 18:59.506
but I don't want to be
reminded of it over
the cornflakes every morning.

18:59.589 --> 19:01.800
It's not fair on you at all.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.387
Puts Archie
in a difficult position, too.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.098
But... I thought
you'd be on my side.

19:09.433 --> 19:10.559
I am.

Your new home.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.528

your breakfast.

19:41.173 --> 19:43.091
I'll leave you to it.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.100
I need to know
before I defrost the smokies.

I was just thinking
about Paul, that's all.

20:18.293 --> 20:20.087
You are pleased
to see him, aren't you?

20:20.170 --> 20:21.922
Yeah.

20:22.005 --> 20:25.175
It's just a bit sudden,
him turning up like this.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.010
We are his family.

20:27.094 --> 20:30.430
Mmm. But he hardly knows us.

To be perfectly honest,
we're almost
complete strangers.

20:33.350 --> 20:37.688
I just hope he's not
expecting too much.

20:37.771 --> 20:40.065
Well, he's expecting
to live with us.

likes the idea of that
very much.

in the world, or what?

I don't know a better one.

21:20.272 --> 21:22.941
Does the campsite
get used much?

21:23.025 --> 21:25.485
(SIGHS) No, we get
a few people up here
in the summer,

21:25.569 --> 21:30.407
but you don't need to worry
about your privacy just yet.

Have you got
a couple of minutes?
I could do with some advice.

21:33.910 --> 21:36.538
Sure. I could do
with some breakfast.

a good evening?

Oh, we went to visit friends.

22:05.442 --> 22:08.195
We were in rather late.
I hope we didn't disturb you.

22:08.278 --> 22:10.238
Oh, oh, no, not at all.

22:10.322 --> 22:13.283
I had my headphones on,
listening to my music...
My Nigella tapes.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.826
Mmm. Ah.

22:19.581 --> 22:20.832
How did I do?

22:20.916 --> 22:23.627
Uh, walk to the kerb
from here, I think.

22:23.710 --> 22:27.172
Be honest.
Have I any chance
of passing my test?

22:27.255 --> 22:30.384
Well, I think I know you
well enough to say

22:30.467 --> 22:32.511
you usually get
what you want.

22:32.594 --> 22:35.722
I wish that was true.
Anyway, thank you
for my lesson.

22:35.806 --> 22:38.392
-You can keep the keys.
-Why?

22:38.475 --> 22:41.228
I want you to have the car.
A good-luck present
for the test.

22:41.311 --> 22:44.564
-I couldn't possibly!
-Of course you can.

22:44.648 --> 22:46.400
I can't! I...

22:46.483 --> 22:49.319
Andrew, you've already been
such a kind friend.

22:49.403 --> 22:54.324
Molly, we're more
than just friends.
You know that as well as I do.

22:54.408 --> 22:58.495
And what I said last night
about the spare room,
I mean it.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.747
If living in the same house
as Paul is going
to be a problem,

23:00.831 --> 23:02.916
you don't have to.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.377
Come and share
my house with me.

23:08.422 --> 23:10.716
-I couldn't possibly.
-Why not?

23:11.675 --> 23:13.552
Because...

23:13.635 --> 23:15.721
Because I don't want to.

23:15.804 --> 23:17.931
Uh, it's probably my fault.

23:18.015 --> 23:21.768
I've given
the wrong impression.
I mean, I obviously have.

23:22.936 --> 23:25.105
No, it's me.

23:25.188 --> 23:29.026
Well, I thought
you wanted a change,
a new direction.

23:29.109 --> 23:30.610
-Perhaps not.
-I do.

23:32.029 --> 23:34.865
You hate the idea of Paul
moving into Glenbogle.

23:34.948 --> 23:35.991
And you've turned
down my offer.

23:38.327 --> 23:40.787
For the same reason. I...

23:40.871 --> 23:44.249
I don't like being bullied
or taken for granted.

23:46.293 --> 23:47.377
I...

23:49.755 --> 23:52.382
I think it would be best
if we didn't see
each other any more.

23:52.466 --> 23:53.467
-Molly!
-I'm sorry.

24:15.322 --> 24:18.825
So what is it
I'm supposed
to be checking?

24:18.909 --> 24:21.119
Well, you know the pipes
that run down
by the back stairs?

24:21.203 --> 24:23.080
Golly thought
there may be a leak.
I'll go if you like.

24:23.163 --> 24:25.290
No, no, no.
You just stay there.

24:27.876 --> 24:29.378
Morning.

24:29.461 --> 24:31.213
Well, hi,
how was your night?

24:31.296 --> 24:32.839
That campsite
is unbelievable.

24:32.923 --> 24:34.424
Yeah, I know,
I've heard it all before.

24:34.508 --> 24:36.051
It's boggy,
it's full of midges.

24:36.134 --> 24:37.511
I'll probably close it down
at the end of the summer.

24:37.594 --> 24:39.721
No, it's unbelievably good.

24:41.181 --> 24:44.142
Look, uh, I've got
something for you.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.897
That's how I'm going
to pay my way.

24:48.981 --> 24:50.983
I did the full
mountain training course
when I was in the Army

24:51.066 --> 24:53.568
and I've worked
as an instructor, too.

24:53.652 --> 24:56.446
You've got the mountains,
I've got the qualifications.

24:56.530 --> 24:59.533
Together, we've got
a climbing school.

25:01.034 --> 25:02.327
Look, I don't want
to be negative about this,

25:02.411 --> 25:05.539
but we...
We did some research
into climbing courses.

25:05.622 --> 25:08.750
-We weren't that convinced.
-Listen, I've...
I've roughed out a plan.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.210
If you'd have a look.

25:11.503 --> 25:12.713
Well, the campsite's perfect.

25:12.796 --> 25:14.381
I've talked it all
through with Golly.

25:14.464 --> 25:16.341
We could use that
as the base camp

25:16.425 --> 25:20.095
and shuttle the climbers
up to the rock face
in four-by-fours.

25:39.114 --> 25:41.283
Oh!

25:41.366 --> 25:43.869
As soon as you talk
about any sort of
adventure activity,

25:43.952 --> 25:45.412
you open a whole can
of worms

25:45.495 --> 25:47.497
with health and safety,
not to mention insurance.

25:47.581 --> 25:48.874
Well, the Army
are very hot on safety,

25:48.957 --> 25:51.168
but obviously
I'll do a relevant course.

25:51.251 --> 25:53.754
Well, it's not just that,
it's the money to set it up.

25:53.837 --> 25:55.213
It's not exactly
good timing.

25:55.297 --> 25:56.923
LEXIE: Archie!

25:57.007 --> 25:58.675
-There's been a break-in.
-ARCHIE: What?

25:58.759 --> 26:01.511
They've taken all the silver,
all of Molly's ornaments.

26:01.595 --> 26:03.722
-I don't believe it.
-Shall I call the police?

26:03.805 --> 26:05.891
-LEXIE: I just did.
-Anything else I can do?

26:05.974 --> 26:07.851
ARCHIE: That's okay.
We can manage.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.519
Let's talk about it
later, all right?

26:09.603 --> 26:11.897
Yeah, sure.
I... I'll be with Golly.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.231
They must have
got in in the night.

26:13.315 --> 26:15.108
That means they had
the whole house
to themselves.

26:15.192 --> 26:16.860
Let's see what else
is missing.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.904
-It's not fair.
-I know.

26:26.370 --> 26:31.541
I'll wait with you.
You probably won't want
to stay that long.

26:31.625 --> 26:35.128
I mean, after all,
it's not exactly what
you'd call a great house.

26:35.212 --> 26:37.339
More of a big bungalow,

26:37.422 --> 26:39.925
albeit with a few turrets.

26:40.008 --> 26:43.387
Welcome to Kilwillie Castle.
Bollinger or Moet?

26:44.137 --> 26:46.682
Thank you so much.

26:46.765 --> 26:49.643
-It really doesn't matter,
but thank you.
-Thank you.

26:49.726 --> 26:51.436
Excuse me.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.562
Goodbye, Duncan.

27:03.365 --> 27:07.786
Burglary, (SIGHS)
it's a terrible crime,
Mr MacDonald.

27:07.869 --> 27:12.124
Oh, you wouldn't believe
the amount of paperwork
involved, you know.

27:13.458 --> 27:16.670
You don't know
who might have done it?
Hmm?

27:17.963 --> 27:20.424
Um, well, judging by
what they've taken,

27:20.507 --> 27:23.135
somebody with a taste
for antique silver.

27:23.218 --> 27:25.846
Well, that narrows it down
a wee bit.

27:26.805 --> 27:29.349
Uh, next question.

27:29.433 --> 27:32.477
Has anyone,
apart from the family,

27:33.437 --> 27:34.521
been inside the house?

27:35.272 --> 27:37.107
Uh, well, there's Paul.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.526
Well, he's family.

27:39.609 --> 27:43.947
Oh? I thought
there was just you
and Mrs MacDonald,

27:44.031 --> 27:47.117
and the other
Mrs MacDonald.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.994
And the dogs, of course.

27:49.077 --> 27:52.289
Although, obviously,
we don't treat them
as suspects.

27:54.791 --> 27:58.420
Uh, my half-brother,
Paul Bowman,
he's visiting us.

27:58.503 --> 28:01.965
And, uh,
does he have an interest
in antique silver?

28:03.675 --> 28:05.469
Well, he wants to come
and live in the house.

28:05.552 --> 28:07.971
I very much doubt
he'd steal from it,
but why don't you ask him?

28:10.807 --> 28:12.100
I'll do that.

28:22.486 --> 28:25.322
I've made a list
of all the things that I think
have been stolen,

28:25.405 --> 28:28.033
but maybe you should
check it.

28:28.116 --> 28:29.493
If it's gone, it's gone.

28:31.828 --> 28:33.830
It's just been one thing
after another, hasn't it?

28:35.040 --> 28:38.251
We will get through this.

28:38.335 --> 28:41.046
At least we don't have
to clean the silver
any more.

28:41.129 --> 28:42.172
It's not the silver.

28:44.341 --> 28:48.011
It's Andrew.
I told him I didn't want
to see him any more.

28:48.095 --> 28:49.179
Why?

28:51.431 --> 28:54.267
For the first time in years,
I've had someone to talk to.

28:54.351 --> 28:58.313
Hector was lovely,
but he didn't know a Titian
from a tea urn.

29:01.358 --> 29:04.861
Andrew does.
He knows all about Titians
and tea urns.

29:06.863 --> 29:08.282
Oh, what am I gonna do?

29:09.783 --> 29:11.702
Why have you told him
you can't see him any more?

29:11.785 --> 29:13.370
(SIGHS) He's been
giving me presents,

29:13.453 --> 29:14.955
he's asked me
to live with him,

29:15.038 --> 29:17.666
he's kissed me...

29:17.749 --> 29:20.961
Well, I suppose
I kissed him, too.

29:21.044 --> 29:23.630
-Oh, it's all so complicated.
-It's not.

29:25.132 --> 29:26.717
And Andrew...

29:26.800 --> 29:30.304
Come on,
you could do a lot worse.

29:30.387 --> 29:32.973
I'd grab him
while you have the chance.

29:33.056 --> 29:35.726
You mean my last chance.

29:35.809 --> 29:37.519
I didn't say that.

29:39.688 --> 29:41.481
I suppose
Paul coming back
hasn't helped.

29:44.276 --> 29:47.404
No matter what I do,
seeing him upsets me.

29:47.487 --> 29:49.865
I know it doesn't make
any sense,

29:49.948 --> 29:53.160
and I'm probably being
very selfish, but...

29:53.243 --> 29:55.162
(SIGHS)

29:55.245 --> 30:00.167
For the best part of 40 years,
I've put other people first.

30:03.128 --> 30:04.838
Isn't it my turn now?

30:13.555 --> 30:14.723
Golly?

30:15.557 --> 30:17.726
Golly!

30:17.809 --> 30:21.980
He's gone
to feed the wolves.
Be back soon.

30:22.064 --> 30:26.818
I, uh, didn't get a chance
to say hello properly,
the other night.

30:26.902 --> 30:28.695
MOLLY: No...

30:30.280 --> 30:31.865
Well, I'd better go
and look for him.

30:31.949 --> 30:33.742
I'll come with you.
I haven't been up
to the wolf pens yet.

30:33.825 --> 30:36.203
No, no.
I'd rather go on my own.

30:37.788 --> 30:40.958
I thought
we'd got past who I am,
and all that.

30:42.167 --> 30:44.044
Yes, yes, yes, we did.

30:45.420 --> 30:46.463
So?

30:50.425 --> 30:52.427
Why have you come back?

30:53.720 --> 30:57.057
I had to go somewhere, and...

30:57.140 --> 30:59.893
Well, I suppose
I've sort of fallen in love
with the place.

31:01.436 --> 31:03.730
Your being here
is very difficult for me.

31:03.814 --> 31:06.900
I know it shouldn't be,
but it is.

31:06.984 --> 31:09.111
I can't explain why,
it's just how I feel.

31:09.194 --> 31:12.614
(INHALES DEEPLY)
It's nothing to do
with you personally.

31:12.698 --> 31:14.074
I'm sorry.

31:15.909 --> 31:17.953
There we are.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.460
Molly, what can I do for you?

31:25.544 --> 31:27.671
I wonder if I could have
a driving lesson.

31:27.754 --> 31:29.047
You've been
driving for years.

31:29.131 --> 31:31.049
But I've never had a licence.

31:31.133 --> 31:33.260
Andrew was teaching me
but it didn't work out.

31:33.343 --> 31:35.595
If you could
possibly spare me
half an hour?

31:35.679 --> 31:38.265
Of course, lass.
It'll be a pleasure.

31:38.348 --> 31:40.225
Paul's got everything
under control here.

31:52.446 --> 31:55.407
Oh, no,
you're in her bed! Here!

31:55.490 --> 31:57.159
Come on, get out!

31:58.619 --> 31:59.703
Out!

32:00.871 --> 32:02.122
Get out!

32:03.749 --> 32:05.292
This is not your room!

32:06.126 --> 32:08.170
Dogs! (EXHALES)

32:14.009 --> 32:16.637
I couldn't find your brother,
Mr MacDonald.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.181
Well, he must be out
on the estate somewhere.

32:19.264 --> 32:21.141
I dare say.

32:21.224 --> 32:22.643
I tell you what.

32:22.726 --> 32:26.063
How about I ask you
the questions I had for him?

32:26.146 --> 32:29.983
(CHUCKLES) This is
from DS Worrall at HQ.

32:30.067 --> 32:31.777
Yeah...

32:31.860 --> 32:36.281
"Was Paul Bowman
in your house
on his own at any time?"

32:36.365 --> 32:39.159
Yes, I found him
there yesterday.

32:40.243 --> 32:41.620
But he's not a thief.

32:41.703 --> 32:44.414
Well, I said that to the DS,
but the thing is,

32:44.498 --> 32:48.001
he found out that
your brother spent some time
in a military prison.

32:49.336 --> 32:50.379
Well, we didn't know that.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.590
I... I don't believe that
he would steal from us.

32:53.674 --> 32:55.384
Oh, I'm not accusing anyone,

32:55.467 --> 32:58.929
but the DS, he likes
his clear-up rate, you know.

33:00.389 --> 33:01.682
There is one other thing.

33:02.099 --> 33:03.767
Um...

33:03.850 --> 33:07.688
What has Mr Bowman
been doing since
he left the Army?

33:07.771 --> 33:09.523
Uh, we thought
he came straight here.

33:09.606 --> 33:12.401
Mmm, no. He's been out
for three months.

33:13.485 --> 33:14.861
ARCHIE: Well, then
I have no idea.

33:16.613 --> 33:18.573
If you don't mind me saying,

33:18.657 --> 33:23.412
there seems to be
quite a lot about this brother
of yours that you don't know.

33:23.495 --> 33:26.581
He's a real man
of mystery, eh?

33:36.717 --> 33:40.304
GOLLY: Okay,
you're at a crossroads.
What do you do now?

33:43.015 --> 33:46.018
You're right.
I am at a crossroads.

33:46.101 --> 33:48.770
I need to look
for some sort of sign.

33:51.356 --> 33:52.733
(HORN BLARES)

33:55.360 --> 33:56.653
Um... (SIGHS)

33:56.737 --> 33:59.364
Well, that was
some sort of sign.

34:01.742 --> 34:04.202
-It means "give way".
-(SIGHS)

34:04.286 --> 34:05.704
How long have we got
till your test?

34:05.787 --> 34:08.081
Eighteen hours.
It's tomorrow morning.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.168
Right.

34:14.338 --> 34:16.465
I took another look
at the campsite
this lunchtime.

34:16.547 --> 34:19.009
There's a great place
to build an equipment store
and shower block.

34:19.092 --> 34:20.677
And how are we
going to pay for all this?

34:20.761 --> 34:22.179
I can make it pay for itself.

34:22.262 --> 34:24.764
I just need
some investment up front.

34:24.848 --> 34:26.391
I don't expect
to start building tomorrow.

34:26.475 --> 34:27.684
Just as long
as I can start planning.

34:29.061 --> 34:30.812
Oh, come on, Archie.

34:30.896 --> 34:32.813
You have to admit,
the climbing school
fits in perfectly

34:32.898 --> 34:34.440
with the other schemes
you've got going.

34:34.524 --> 34:36.150
And, like our other ventures,

34:36.234 --> 34:38.945
it depends on the weather
and attracting
enough visitors.

34:39.029 --> 34:40.489
What happens if we have
a bad summer?

34:40.572 --> 34:43.199
I'll work harder through
the autumn and winter.

34:43.283 --> 34:44.826
It'll balance out.

34:44.909 --> 34:46.286
It's not as easy
as that, Paul.

34:49.081 --> 34:52.376
I'm sorry, I'm not going
to put my money into this.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.627
There's nothing wrong
with the business plan.

34:57.839 --> 35:01.301
-This is about
something else, isn't it?
-Like what?

35:01.385 --> 35:03.512
You don't want me
to live here.

35:03.595 --> 35:05.347
All that stuff about me
being a member
of the family,

35:05.430 --> 35:07.432
welcome back here
at any time.

35:07.516 --> 35:09.935
-That were just good manners.
-You are welcome here.

35:10.018 --> 35:11.520
I don't think so.

35:11.603 --> 35:13.105
Molly's made that
perfectly clear.

35:13.188 --> 35:16.441
You could at least
be honest about it.

35:16.525 --> 35:18.819
All right, let's start
being honest, then,
shall we?

35:20.904 --> 35:23.490
You didn't stay in touch
when you were away
because you couldn't.

35:24.533 --> 35:26.243
You were in prison.

35:26.326 --> 35:29.037
For being absent
without leave.

35:29.121 --> 35:31.248
I did my time,
and that's all
there is to it.

35:31.331 --> 35:32.915
And it just slipped
your mind.

35:32.999 --> 35:34.458
It's none of your business.

35:34.542 --> 35:36.295
Oh, it is if you're living
in my house.

35:36.378 --> 35:38.170
Yeah, your house,

35:38.255 --> 35:40.173
where you don't really
want people like me.

35:40.256 --> 35:41.883
Not really
MacDonald class.

35:41.967 --> 35:45.679
-You just being stupid now.
-Not so stupid
I don't know my rights.

35:45.762 --> 35:47.848
If you're threatening me
with lawyers, forget it.

35:48.974 --> 35:50.641
Oh, what's going on here?

35:50.725 --> 35:53.269
Paul is threatening
to take us to court.

35:53.353 --> 35:55.063
I didn't say that.

36:02.153 --> 36:03.447
Oh, fine.

36:04.697 --> 36:05.781
See you.

36:08.451 --> 36:10.203
Uh, sorry about the...

36:11.246 --> 36:12.664
...dog-related damage.

36:12.748 --> 36:15.000
I'll get it cleared up.

36:15.083 --> 36:19.212
I'm polishing up
this old silver for you.
Free of charge.

36:19.295 --> 36:21.173
Oh, there's no need
to go to such trouble.

36:21.256 --> 36:24.259
Uh, they're just
one or two things we got
in a car-boot sale.

36:24.343 --> 36:25.469
Nothing special.

36:25.552 --> 36:27.262
Yeah, no...

36:27.346 --> 36:29.890
Oh, we've loads of stuff
like this up
at the Big House.

36:29.973 --> 36:34.394
Um, we've been thinking
about our book, Duncan,

36:34.478 --> 36:38.023
and Kilwillie Castle
is certainly very impressive,

36:38.106 --> 36:41.318
but it has none
of the charm of Glenbogle.

36:42.944 --> 36:44.696
You mean...

36:44.780 --> 36:48.659
You're going to put
Glenbogle in your book?

36:48.742 --> 36:51.286
(WHISPERS)
Shh, it'll be our secret.

37:02.214 --> 37:04.716
Aye, aye,
are you going somewhere?

37:05.634 --> 37:06.677
Home.

37:07.886 --> 37:09.221
Where's that?

37:09.304 --> 37:11.056
Obviously not here.

37:14.518 --> 37:15.686
It was good
seeing you again.

37:16.645 --> 37:17.938
You, too.

37:20.065 --> 37:26.238
Um, actually,
I was going to be asking you
for a wee favour.

37:26.321 --> 37:31.702
I'm planning to put a guard
on the house tonight
in case the thieves come back.

37:31.785 --> 37:35.414
So, I was looking
for a wee bit of company.

37:35.497 --> 37:39.293
Uh, listen, I'll understand
if you, you know, if you want
to just get on your way.

37:40.294 --> 37:42.963
No. No, I'd like to stay.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.300
Good.

37:51.346 --> 37:53.974
So, what are you
going to do about Paul?

37:54.057 --> 37:56.226
I don't know.

37:56.310 --> 37:57.853
But if he really wants
to take us to court,

37:57.936 --> 38:00.022
he'll soon find out
how much money
we've got.

38:00.105 --> 38:03.191
We haven't even got
the family silver left.

38:03.275 --> 38:06.028
It's not your fault that
we were burgled,

38:06.111 --> 38:08.030
or that the bomb went off.

38:08.113 --> 38:11.533
No. But it doesn't help me
being stuck here though,
does it?

38:11.617 --> 38:13.994
You should go
and talk to him
before he goes.

38:14.077 --> 38:16.079
No, it's better like this.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.957
At least it solves
the problem with my mother.

38:19.041 --> 38:21.209
Yeah. That's the easy way out.

38:21.293 --> 38:23.128
She was right.

38:23.211 --> 38:24.755
Paul wasn't being
straight with us.

38:24.838 --> 38:28.091
He can't just turn up
and expect us
to embrace his plans.

38:30.010 --> 38:32.512
Remember when you
first came back here?

38:32.596 --> 38:35.974
And you were
full of enthusiasm
and new ideas.

38:36.058 --> 38:38.352
Hector wouldn't let you
change a thing?

38:38.435 --> 38:39.645
Yeah, so?

38:39.728 --> 38:43.732
Well, eventually, he...
He gave you a chance.

38:43.815 --> 38:46.526
And from what he says,
he's come back to put
something into the estate,

38:46.610 --> 38:48.487
not take from it.

38:48.570 --> 38:51.281
I mean, if he wants
to come back
and talk reasonably...

38:51.365 --> 38:53.158
Well, he's not
going to do that.

38:53.241 --> 38:54.701
Well, that's
his problem. (SIGHS)

38:54.785 --> 38:56.495
And it's our loss.

38:58.038 --> 39:00.332
You'll just have to go to him.

39:02.626 --> 39:04.878
He'll be gone in the morning.

39:08.465 --> 39:10.842
Do you know
where he is tonight?

39:11.635 --> 39:13.053
How could I?

39:14.179 --> 39:16.181
He's guarding our house.

39:24.481 --> 39:27.567
GOLLY: Do you know
what the MacDonald family
motto is?

39:27.651 --> 39:29.236
PAUL: What?

39:29.319 --> 39:33.365
"I'm gonna do it my way,
never mind what
anyone else thinks."

39:33.448 --> 39:36.743
PAUL: You think
that's what I've been doing?
GOLLY: You and Archie.

39:36.827 --> 39:39.913
Hector was just as bad,
if not worse.

39:39.997 --> 39:42.124
That's the MacDonalds
for you,

39:42.207 --> 39:45.252
brave, fearless
and quite frequently shot at
from all sides,

39:45.335 --> 39:48.588
mainly by their nearest
and dearest.

39:48.672 --> 39:51.091
Yeah. I suppose
I could've handled
things a bit better.

39:51.174 --> 39:55.220
(SIGHS) Well, coming up here,
knowing all the answers,

39:55.304 --> 39:56.430
determined to get
your own way,

39:56.513 --> 39:59.975
it's just not the way
to deal with Archie.

40:00.058 --> 40:03.312
Well, I'll be out of here
tomorrow morning anyway.

40:03.395 --> 40:06.481
Ah, well.
I'll miss your company.

40:07.024 --> 40:08.650
(LAUGHS)

40:08.734 --> 40:10.736
You'll be the only one.

42:00.554 --> 42:02.681
Golly, I can't do this.

42:02.764 --> 42:05.100
Of course you can,
you've been driving
for years.

42:05.183 --> 42:08.437
But my driving
doesn't fit in at all
with driving-test driving.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.689
And I'm...
I'm in such a state.

42:10.772 --> 42:12.983
I mean, I nearly hit
that wall by the shops.

42:13.066 --> 42:16.611
Well, you did hit it.
But not that hard.

42:16.695 --> 42:18.822
(SIGHS) I'm useless
at driving!

42:18.905 --> 42:22.743
So are half the folk
on the roads.
It's just a driving test.

42:22.826 --> 42:25.954
-It's hardly going
to change your life.
-That's just the point. It is.

42:26.038 --> 42:27.789
This is my crossroads,

42:27.873 --> 42:31.918
where I find out
whether I stay as the old
stick-in-the-mud Molly

42:32.002 --> 42:34.838
who never wants
anything to change, ever,

42:36.006 --> 42:37.966
or I find another road.

42:38.050 --> 42:39.718
A completely new direction.

42:39.801 --> 42:41.553
Then in that case
you have to be true
to yourself, Molly.

42:41.637 --> 42:43.680
You have to believe
in yourself.

42:43.764 --> 42:45.849
(SIGHS) I wish I could.

42:46.433 --> 42:48.810
Look at me.

42:48.894 --> 42:51.229
Yeah, look me
right in the eyes.

42:52.606 --> 42:54.358
You are going to pass
that test, Molly.

42:56.401 --> 42:57.527
Okay?

43:00.864 --> 43:02.157
(INHALES DEEPLY)

43:07.537 --> 43:09.873
You know the service
in this place
has really gone downhill.

43:09.957 --> 43:11.041
And where's my coffee?

43:12.960 --> 43:14.711
(SIGHS) Tell Lexie.

43:15.879 --> 43:17.839
Henrietta and Margot.

43:19.216 --> 43:20.717
Run off.

43:20.801 --> 43:22.886
Aw, they haven't
paid their bill?

43:23.804 --> 43:24.888
Worse than that.

43:30.352 --> 43:34.314
-This is one of our spoons.
-It was in their room.

43:34.398 --> 43:37.526
There was a whole load
of silver in their room.

43:37.609 --> 43:38.902
I cleaned it all for them.

43:38.986 --> 43:41.238
Why didn't you try
and stop them?

43:41.321 --> 43:44.950
-I've called the police.
-They could be
anywhere by now.

43:46.868 --> 43:48.120
(SIGHS)

43:48.996 --> 43:50.080
No.

43:50.664 --> 43:52.082
No, hang on.

43:53.083 --> 43:54.418
I know where they'll be.

43:54.501 --> 43:57.129
They are not cookery writers!
They are thieves!

43:57.212 --> 43:59.923
I can understand
you are upset that
the best house has won.

44:00.007 --> 44:02.342
They've taken
all of our silver
from the dining room!

44:02.426 --> 44:04.303
Well, there's no accounting
for taste.

44:04.386 --> 44:07.597
But I can assure you,
we take much better care
of our property.

44:07.681 --> 44:10.350
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-What is it, Badger?

44:10.434 --> 44:13.437
Lord Kilwillie,
his military memorabilia...

44:13.520 --> 44:15.605
Gone.

44:15.689 --> 44:18.066
Excellent! It saves me
having to get rid of it.

44:18.150 --> 44:23.405
Your Ladyship's wardrobe
would also appear
to have been tampered with.

44:23.488 --> 44:24.573
Not my Versace!

44:29.411 --> 44:31.204
Look, that...
That's them there!

44:31.288 --> 44:33.332
They needed a bigger car
for all your stuff!

44:33.415 --> 44:35.167
-LEXIE:
Someone, call the police!
-Do something!

44:35.250 --> 44:36.627
Look, it's okay!

44:37.628 --> 44:39.463
We could still catch them!

44:43.800 --> 44:45.719
Badger, the car.

44:53.852 --> 44:55.312
ARCHIE: Dunc?

44:57.189 --> 45:00.609
Oh, hello, Mother.
Somebody left this for you.

45:00.692 --> 45:02.277
Oh, thank you.

45:02.361 --> 45:03.612
You haven't seen Paul,
have you?

45:03.695 --> 45:06.907
No. I'm looking for him, too.

45:06.990 --> 45:08.283
Oh, really? Why?

45:08.367 --> 45:11.119
Uh, I think he should stay.

45:11.203 --> 45:14.373
-Well, what's changed?
-My life.

45:14.456 --> 45:16.249
I took my driving test
this morning

45:16.333 --> 45:18.585
and I realised
that I had to make
an agreement with myself.

45:18.669 --> 45:20.212
If I fail,
I'll go with what I've got.

45:20.295 --> 45:22.422
If I pass,
I'll try something new.

45:22.506 --> 45:24.758
Ha! And I passed!

45:24.841 --> 45:27.094
Congratulations.

45:27.177 --> 45:29.680
So you bet your future
on your driving test?

45:29.763 --> 45:32.099
I wish I'd put money
on it now.

45:32.182 --> 45:34.643
I don't dislike Paul.
In fact I quite like him.

45:34.726 --> 45:37.646
But I don't much like change.
I'm like you.

45:37.729 --> 45:40.440
We don't like having
change thrust upon us.

45:40.524 --> 45:42.818
-No, we like it
on our own terms.
-(CHUCKLES)

45:42.901 --> 45:44.778
Or we sulk, behave badly.

45:46.196 --> 45:48.532
Why do you want
to talk to Paul?

45:48.615 --> 45:50.367
Uh, because I have to.

45:50.450 --> 45:51.660
Then we'd better get going.

45:51.743 --> 45:53.954
Yeah, but how are we
going to do that?

45:54.037 --> 45:56.123
In my new car, of course.

45:58.792 --> 46:01.086
ARCHIE: That was him, Mother!

46:21.398 --> 46:22.691
(HORN HONKING)

46:28.780 --> 46:30.365
Paul!

46:32.034 --> 46:33.452
Pull over!

46:33.535 --> 46:34.578
Pull over!

46:36.079 --> 46:37.456
Pull over!

46:44.296 --> 46:46.214
Listen, I need to talk to you.

46:46.298 --> 46:48.175
Talk? You nearly
bloody killed me.

46:48.258 --> 46:50.719
Oh, that was me.
I've just passed my test.

46:50.802 --> 46:54.640
Listen, if you're leaving,
I don't want it
to be like this.

46:55.849 --> 46:58.518
No, you're right.

46:58.602 --> 47:01.188
I'm sorry, I should have
told you about what
happened with the Army.

47:02.481 --> 47:04.358
Archie, it's not
how it looks.

47:04.441 --> 47:06.109
I've never been
in trouble before.

47:06.193 --> 47:07.778
It was only
because I came up here
looking for my...

47:09.196 --> 47:10.280
My father.

47:11.740 --> 47:13.450
They imprisoned me
for being AWOL.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.828
I sat in this cell
in Colchester Barracks

47:16.912 --> 47:18.330
wondering what happened
to my life.

47:19.748 --> 47:21.708
How I'd ended up in jail?

47:21.792 --> 47:24.920
That was where
I had the idea
for the climbing school.

47:25.003 --> 47:26.546
You're right,
you should have told me.

47:26.630 --> 47:28.465
I didn't want you
to think badly of me.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.219
Maybe I'm just
kidding myself.

47:32.302 --> 47:36.181
Everything I own
is in the back of a camper van
that won't see its next MOT.

47:37.766 --> 47:39.393
Great addition
to the family, me.

47:40.978 --> 47:42.813
I'd like you to stay.

47:44.606 --> 47:48.360
Well, what would I do?
If the climbing school
won't pay.

47:48.443 --> 47:50.946
Well, maybe
you can think about running
some other things as well.

47:51.029 --> 47:53.573
I could do that.
I... I'd like to do that.

47:53.657 --> 47:56.076
I want you to be
part of Glenbogle.

47:58.245 --> 47:59.913
-Really?
-Yeah.

48:01.832 --> 48:04.584
You spent last night
guarding my house,

48:04.668 --> 48:08.088
I realised that this place
must mean as much to you
as it does to me.

48:09.756 --> 48:11.258
So what do you say?

48:13.051 --> 48:14.469
When do I start?

48:14.553 --> 48:15.846
-(CAR HORN HONKING)
-MOLLY: Archie.

48:19.391 --> 48:23.478
It looks as if it's going
to turn into one of those
road-rage thingummyjigs!

48:31.653 --> 48:33.488
Can't you go any faster?

48:33.572 --> 48:35.532
DOROTHY: Och, there's no need.

48:35.616 --> 48:37.159
Look, we're
in a fearful hurry.

48:37.242 --> 48:39.036
Do get out of the way.

48:39.119 --> 48:41.955
-(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
-Oh. Sorry.

48:42.039 --> 48:44.958
-(SIREN WAILING)
-BADGER: Ah, the long
arm of the law.

48:49.212 --> 48:51.006
If I'd known there's going
to be two of them,

48:51.089 --> 48:53.884
I'd have brought
the other pair of handcuffs,
you know.

48:59.056 --> 49:01.767
This frock requires
specialist dry cleaning,

49:01.850 --> 49:04.269
and you will be paying for it.
This is all your fault.

49:04.353 --> 49:07.439
Uh, no. I think you'll find
it's mainly your fault.

49:07.522 --> 49:11.777
The interview you did
for Scotland in Vogue
about Kilwillie Castle...

49:11.860 --> 49:14.821
That is why
these two women
came up here.

49:14.905 --> 49:18.408
Now, obviously,
Glenbogle wouldn't
have been worth the trip.

49:22.037 --> 49:24.122
Lex.

49:24.206 --> 49:26.750
I only did it
for you and Arch,

49:26.833 --> 49:28.543
to try and say sorry.

49:28.627 --> 49:30.379
Well, you did your best.

49:30.462 --> 49:33.548
Yeah, and my best
was rubbish, as usual.

49:33.632 --> 49:37.094
Auntie Liz said
not to take in guests
'cause I'd be no good at it.

49:37.177 --> 49:39.680
I thought I'd prove
her wrong, too.
It turns out she was right.

49:39.763 --> 49:44.393
No, look. We wouldn't
have caught them
if it wasn't for you.

49:44.476 --> 49:47.771
Anyway, I think
you're pretty much
the best head ranger

49:47.854 --> 49:50.107
that Glenbogle
has ever had.

49:50.983 --> 49:53.193
Thanks, Lex.

49:53.276 --> 49:56.738
Hey, I'm the only
head ranger
Glenbogle has ever had!

49:59.116 --> 50:00.784
I'll send the bill
on to you.

50:00.867 --> 50:04.329
We may not be in a position
to pay immediately.

50:04.413 --> 50:06.331
The food was lovely.

50:13.338 --> 50:15.257
Congratulations.

50:15.340 --> 50:17.467
-You didn't think
I could do it.
-Nonsense!

50:17.551 --> 50:19.469
I've got some
champagne on ice.

50:19.553 --> 50:23.307
-You see,
all those lessons paid off.
-Yes, I suppose they did.

50:23.390 --> 50:25.392
And the test itself,
it wasn't a problem?

50:25.475 --> 50:28.186
No, no.
The examiner was so kind.

50:28.270 --> 50:29.688
I didn't recognise him
at first.

50:29.771 --> 50:32.316
Turns out he's a member
of Hector's old golf club.

50:33.025 --> 50:34.609
I see.

50:34.693 --> 50:36.278
The car keys?

50:36.361 --> 50:38.697
I dropped them off.
I was hoping you might have
changed your mind.

50:38.780 --> 50:41.742
-I'm afraid I've started
using it already.
-Good.

50:44.745 --> 50:46.496
I've taken a look
at the engineer's report.

50:46.580 --> 50:48.290
You'll need to underpin
the area that was damaged,

50:48.373 --> 50:50.459
but there's no reason
why you shouldn't
move back in.

50:51.501 --> 50:53.128
-When?
-As soon as you like.

50:53.211 --> 50:54.713
Well, that's great news.
Thank you.

50:54.796 --> 50:56.840
-No problem.
-Thanks. Bye.

51:00.761 --> 51:03.639
See? Everything's going
to be all right.

51:03.722 --> 51:05.307
Of course it is.

51:05.390 --> 51:07.351
Then will you stop worrying?

51:07.434 --> 51:08.977
Is that likely?

51:14.358 --> 51:16.443
If I had been killed,

51:16.526 --> 51:21.573
what would have
happened to you,
to the others, to this place?

51:21.657 --> 51:24.284
I wouldn't want
to leave you on your own
to deal with all this.

51:26.328 --> 51:28.538
Talking of being left alone.

51:28.622 --> 51:30.248
Do you know what?

51:30.332 --> 51:33.043
We've got this house
completely to ourselves.

51:33.877 --> 51:35.879
(GRUNTS) Hi.

51:35.963 --> 51:37.881
Uh, just checking the gear.

51:37.965 --> 51:39.257
(LAUGHS)

51:39.341 --> 51:40.884
I hope you brought
a box of chocolates!
