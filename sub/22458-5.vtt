00:01.567 --> 00:05.845
<i>I'm not sick, but I'm not well</i>

00:05.887 --> 00:09.323
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.367 --> 00:13.883
<i>Cos I'm in hell</i>

00:18.647 --> 00:23.004
Oh, man, record company meeting.
Finally!

00:23.047 --> 00:25.561
Yeah, but we got to watch it.
A lot of these bastards

00:25.607 --> 00:28.360
just want to give you an advance,
promote your stuff,

00:28.407 --> 00:30.318
then make a profit for them and you.

00:30.367 --> 00:34.121
Yeah, but we've got an in. Pej's
sister's mate in the legal department.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.045
Once you're inside legal, that's it.
Game over.

00:37.087 --> 00:39.521
Jeremy. Super Hans. I'm Cally.

00:39.567 --> 00:42.365
Sorry I'm late, mental in the office.

00:42.407 --> 00:44.796
I'm finishing the
Chemical Brothers' contract.

00:44.847 --> 00:46.599
Chemical Brothers? Wow.

00:46.647 --> 00:51.767
So, I checked out your stuff on MySpace
and I literally freaked. Big time.

00:51.807 --> 00:54.241
See? I was so right to get us
on the internet.

00:54.287 --> 00:57.643
- The internet's gonna be massive.
- Yeah, we'll see.

00:57.687 --> 00:59.166
Plus, I love your name.

00:59.207 --> 01:02.961
We've changed the name.
We're now Kersey's Metal Hands.

01:03.007 --> 01:07.159
I like it. So, the good news is,
Universal aren't interested.

01:07.207 --> 01:08.356
Oh.

01:08.407 --> 01:11.877
But I'm looking to source my own acts,
branch out,

01:11.927 --> 01:13.406
and I'd love to sign you up.

01:13.447 --> 01:17.281
The timing's perfect because
we're about to start a new financial year.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.316
Any questions?

01:18.367 --> 01:22.679
There are countries within the European
Union that I'm barred from entering.

01:22.727 --> 01:24.638
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

01:24.687 --> 01:30.045
I'm a very sexual performer. Are you
gonna be able to handle that?

01:30.087 --> 01:33.284
Yes! So, I want a yes or no right now.
Take your time,

01:33.327 --> 01:36.763
but if there's a lot of fucking about,
that for me is a bad sign.

01:36.807 --> 01:38.559
Right, OK.

01:38.607 --> 01:42.395
'Wow! We've finally met the man.
And the man is a woman, and he's hot! '

01:42.447 --> 01:44.199
What do you think? Is she for real?

01:44.247 --> 01:46.807
I don't know. It's hard to tell.

01:46.847 --> 01:50.157
She looks like how you might think
one of them might look like.

01:50.207 --> 01:52.846
- We don't know anything about her.
- She scares me.

01:52.887 --> 01:54.115
I don't trust her.

01:54.167 --> 01:55.885
Let's fucking go for it!

01:59.447 --> 02:02.359
Great night out.
You guys know how to celebrate.

02:02.407 --> 02:04.363
'God, we're so horny.

02:04.407 --> 02:08.446
'We're like a pair of porn stars who
aren't on antidepressants, or anything. '

02:08.487 --> 02:11.365
- So, this is where the magic happens.
- That's right.

02:15.807 --> 02:18.640
- And you're the magician.
- I guess so.

02:18.687 --> 02:19.881
I'm a bit magic.

02:19.927 --> 02:22.805
Would you be able to show me
some magic?

02:22.847 --> 02:25.998
'OK, here we go.
God, we are so hot after the cab.

02:26.047 --> 02:29.676
'I wonder if I'll be able to do all
the stuff she was whispering in my ear.

02:29.727 --> 02:34.243
'Might need a good foothold somewhere
or a harness. Is this a good idea?

02:34.287 --> 02:38.644
'Drunk sex with my new manager?
Yeah! Yeah, it's probably a good idea.

02:38.687 --> 02:41.724
'There'd only be a problem
if there were complications.

02:41.767 --> 02:44.486
'There aren't going to be complications.
Relax!

02:44.527 --> 02:48.122
'Wow! This is definitely happening.
OK, got to focus.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.045
'It's very important
for my future career development

02:51.087 --> 02:53.396
'that I give my manager an orgasm. '

02:53.447 --> 02:55.915
Stop dicking around, Jeremy,
let's get going!

02:55.967 --> 02:59.596
'OK, I'd like more foreplay, but
apparently I have to perform on demand.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.207
'Don't be bitter.
This has got to be great.

03:02.247 --> 03:06.001
'Brilliant sex then novelty bong
then watch a film together.

03:06.047 --> 03:09.005
'If Mark's got around
to buying a new Scart lead, that is.

03:09.047 --> 03:11.117
'Maybe if we got another Scart lead,

03:11.167 --> 03:14.364
'I could use it to plug the Digibox
into the VHS player,

03:14.407 --> 03:16.477
'record straight onto that.

03:16.527 --> 03:19.837
'Or I could use the analogue aerial
into the video and off that... '

03:19.887 --> 03:22.117
- Jeremy.
- Yeah?

03:22.167 --> 03:26.046
- Do you think this is going well?
- Ye... um... Yes?

03:26.087 --> 03:27.998
Nope, it's not really working.

03:28.047 --> 03:30.925
Oh, I... thought it... was.

03:30.967 --> 03:33.117
What's working about it?

03:33.167 --> 03:35.761
Well, now we're talking about it,

03:35.807 --> 03:38.719
it is maybe withering under the lights
a little bit.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.839
Let's not kid ourselves.
There's nothing going on here.

03:41.887 --> 03:45.118
We're just two planks of wood
rubbing against each other.

03:45.167 --> 03:47.806
Do you think?
If you want, I could put a finger...

03:47.847 --> 03:50.805
Let's forget this happened
and get some shuteye, yeah?

03:50.847 --> 03:53.202
Oh... OK.

03:53.247 --> 03:58.241
'Ohh! This is like the time I made Mark
turn that boring DVD off in the middle.

03:58.287 --> 03:59.845
'The Killing Fields.

03:59.887 --> 04:03.960
'This is probably how he felt -
frustrated and horny. '

04:05.967 --> 04:09.039
'Jeremy's getting a manager,
I'm getting divorced.

04:09.087 --> 04:11.885
'Maybe he'll end up happy
and successful and I won't.

04:11.927 --> 04:15.840
'That would be typical. I do everything
society demands and die in a ditch.

04:15.887 --> 04:18.845
'He sits on his arse
and accidentally shits a golden egg! '

04:18.887 --> 04:21.321
You must be Mark.
I'm Cally, got any OJ?

04:21.367 --> 04:24.598
Oh, hi. Yeah,
I think there's some in the fridge.

04:24.647 --> 04:28.686
'Oh, Jesus, hope I'm not wearing
the boxers with the button missing.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.764
'Don't think so -
think I have coverage. '

04:31.807 --> 04:34.560
Tropicana - nice.
Screw the rest, get the best.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.997
I like Original. Jeremy prefers Smooth,
but I'm the one buying.

04:38.047 --> 04:40.322
Don't tell me
he's a smooth peanut butter man, too?

04:40.367 --> 04:42.437
That's right. It isn't as good, is it?

04:42.487 --> 04:48.323
<i>'Is there a button there? Sitting's
gonna pull the thing wide open if not.</i>

04:48.367 --> 04:51.439
'Maybe it's sexy.
Little glimpse of ball sack. '

04:51.487 --> 04:53.955
My date tomorrow night's
cancelled on me.

04:54.007 --> 04:55.565
He's back with his ex.

04:55.607 --> 04:57.802
But I thought...
Aren't you and Jeremy...

04:57.847 --> 05:01.522
Jeremy and I aren't dating. We're
strictly business. Aren't we, Jeremy?

05:01.567 --> 05:03.717
Um... yeah.

05:03.767 --> 05:06.406
He's great,
but he's really not my type.

05:06.447 --> 05:09.837
Jeremy's the kind of guy
who talks the talk,

05:09.887 --> 05:14.244
but he's just never gonna
deliver the goods... Isn't that right?

05:14.287 --> 05:16.517
It's so frustrating.

05:16.567 --> 05:21.038
There must be thousands of cash-rich
and time-poor singles out there.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.078
I just don't have
the time to meet them.

05:23.127 --> 05:26.403
I'm a gap in the market.
Somebody fill me!

05:26.447 --> 05:30.156
'I'll fill you!
I love you, Cally, you are The One!

05:30.207 --> 05:34.359
'Let's get married by Sir Alan Sugar
and live off croissants in Canary Wharf! '

05:34.407 --> 05:37.638
Better make a move.
So, Jez, good news. I'm sending them a CD,

05:37.687 --> 05:41.282
but looks like you're playing
the New Axe Tent at Festivus.

05:41.327 --> 05:43.158
Really?! Festivus!

05:43.207 --> 05:46.563
I'm playing the
Wolverhampton Festivus.

05:46.607 --> 05:49.280
Oh, my God, Mark, I'm in the money!

05:49.327 --> 05:52.637
<i>Everything's gonna be all right!
I am going to be a legend.</i>

05:52.687 --> 05:54.917
And you and all of this
depressing shit

05:54.967 --> 05:57.879
will just be a little footnote
in the massive biog

05:57.927 --> 06:01.442
of how rich and fucked up
I eventually became!

06:03.207 --> 06:05.596
Oh, man,
we're actually going on tour.

06:05.647 --> 06:09.526
It'll be brutal. On the way here I was
almost wishing I'd get hit by a bus...

06:09.567 --> 06:14.402
for my body's sake - so it didn't have to
suffer the hell I'm gonna put it through.

06:14.447 --> 06:17.723
- What sort of stash have you brought?
- What, you kidding?

06:17.767 --> 06:22.124
A band does not take a stash to a fest.
You are a VI-motherhumping-P.

06:22.167 --> 06:26.001
Just open your gob and someone
will slip in something tasty.

06:26.047 --> 06:29.676
A pill, a nipple,
bit of fried halloumi. Lovely!

06:29.727 --> 06:33.276
Cool. What's those?
Something a bit red-hot for down time?

06:33.327 --> 06:36.683
Don't pigeonhole me, dude.
Barchester Chronicles.

06:36.727 --> 06:39.195
Ecclesiastical politics
when you're high.

06:39.247 --> 06:42.444
These guys really knew how to do
a fucking number on each other.

06:42.487 --> 06:45.240
Hello, hello.
Room for one more?

06:45.287 --> 06:47.437
No. What?!

06:47.487 --> 06:51.196
Got a couple of days off round the
weekend, so thought I'd tag along.

06:51.247 --> 06:53.761
But... No, Mark. We're going on tour.

06:53.807 --> 06:56.162
We're going to get fucked up
and monged out

06:56.207 --> 06:57.720
and messed up and dipped over.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.758
We wanna wallow in our own filth, Mark.

06:59.807 --> 07:01.399
Have a good old fucking wallow.

07:01.447 --> 07:03.915
But I've bought a tour jacket especially.

07:03.967 --> 07:07.198
It's leather, and it has lapels,
so I can wear it to work.

07:07.247 --> 07:10.205
If you start working for the Gestapo.
Look, man,

07:10.247 --> 07:12.203
we're a rock band, yeah?

07:12.247 --> 07:15.319
If people see us hanging out
with a donk like you - not being rude...

07:15.367 --> 07:16.402
<i>You are being rude.</i>

07:16.447 --> 07:21.202
Then that takes away our credibility.
- You got a bloody suitcase on wheels.

07:21.247 --> 07:25.399
Real men don't get the Earth to help carry
their luggage. They carry it themselves.

07:25.447 --> 07:27.165
This is because of Cally, isn't it?

07:27.207 --> 07:30.517
That's why you want to come.
Have a pop at the champ.

07:30.567 --> 07:34.401
No, not at all. I've always been
a big supporter of you and your music.

07:34.447 --> 07:39.919
Please, Jez. I'm getting divorced,
I need something to pep me up.

07:39.967 --> 07:43.960
I could do with a roadie. Someone
to pick the lovelies after the gig.

07:44.007 --> 07:46.726
Hump the gear.
Sniff out the street chat.

07:46.767 --> 07:50.999
Exactly. Drugs, birds and physical
labour. Them's me specialties.

07:51.047 --> 07:55.757
All right, you can come,
but all the time while we're on tour,

07:55.807 --> 07:58.685
<i>you will need to shut up. All right?</i>

08:03.407 --> 08:07.480
'Look at her go. Two phones,
spare battery for her BlackBerry.

08:07.527 --> 08:12.476
'No I'm-out-of-juice bullshit
from her! She is so The One. '

08:12.527 --> 08:16.998
So, guys, good news about Festivus.
They listened to your CD and they loved it

08:17.047 --> 08:20.005
and they don't want you to play the fest.
- What?

08:20.047 --> 08:24.438
I've pulled in a massive favour
and I've got you on the bill

08:24.487 --> 08:28.321
at Life '08- one of the fastest-growing
Christian rock festivals out.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.925
Christian?

08:29.967 --> 08:33.277
- You've booked us to play a Jesus fest?
- It's a great circuit to get on.

08:33.327 --> 08:36.159
What do you think, Jez?
It is still a fest.

08:36.207 --> 08:39.085
Yeah, but we're cool.
We've got credibility.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.765
If we play a Jesus gig,
we'll be selling our souls.

08:41.807 --> 08:45.277
Yeah, but Jesus is the best person
to sell your soul to.

08:45.327 --> 08:47.238
That's his whole set-up.

08:47.287 --> 08:50.279
- I vote you go for it.
- Well, I vote no. Let's call it off.

08:50.327 --> 08:53.478
- OK, one V one. Mark?
- From a business point of view...

08:53.527 --> 08:57.076
"From a business point of view!" Since
when did the roadie have voting rights?

08:57.127 --> 09:01.564
I don't tell you how to run your
sweat shops in Burma. Keep your beak out.

09:01.607 --> 09:05.316
Super Hans,
looks like you've got the casting vote.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.483
Executioner's Bong did a bit of Christo.

09:07.527 --> 09:10.564
Now they all live in a fuck-off bungalow
in Fort Lauderdale

09:10.607 --> 09:13.360
eating cherry pie
and banging cheerleaders. I'm in.

09:13.407 --> 09:15.238
I think you made the right decision.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.801
"I think you made
the right decision!"

09:17.847 --> 09:21.283
<i>Jeremy, we agreed not to do
the funny voices after that week.</i>

09:25.047 --> 09:27.163
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

09:27.207 --> 09:30.802
'Two litres of supermarket cola.
I'd like to see Sting do this. '

09:30.847 --> 09:33.281
Drink, drink, drink!

09:33.327 --> 09:38.117
- That is one serious caffeine injection.
- Yeah, man.

09:38.167 --> 09:41.682
It's not such drag, the fest being
drink and drugs free after all!

09:41.727 --> 09:43.922
Word up. But we still get monged.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.878
Just have to use our imagination.

09:45.927 --> 09:48.441
What are you... Hans, are you?

09:48.487 --> 09:49.715
Head rush.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.439
Safe!

09:51.487 --> 09:54.240
Hi, could you give my mate's CD
to your record company?

09:54.287 --> 09:56.084
'Hm, sexy Christian disciples. '

09:56.127 --> 09:57.276
Groupies.

09:57.327 --> 10:00.125
- What are you gonna do?
- She's not really a groupie.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.364
She spoke to the group, she's a groupie.
Hey, hold on, girls,

10:03.407 --> 10:06.797
we're gonna make a spliff
out of nutmeg and banana peel.

10:06.847 --> 10:09.998
The shit under my fingernails
has probably got loads of gear in it.

10:10.047 --> 10:13.676
It's great they're doing this.
You know the download market alone

10:13.727 --> 10:17.606
for Christian rock
is estimated at 40 million plus.

10:17.647 --> 10:20.684
- I put together a bit of research on...
- Wow!

10:20.727 --> 10:23.560
Laminated cover, copyright symbol,
I'm impressed.

10:23.607 --> 10:24.642
Thank you.

10:24.687 --> 10:28.202
This is interesting. What did you
think of the rehearsal? Honestly.

10:28.247 --> 10:33.765
Actually, one thing did occur.
Not wanting to be horrible to Jeremy,

10:33.807 --> 10:37.686
but Super Hans did seem more like
the kind of person

10:37.727 --> 10:39.843
you'd expect to see in a band like this.

10:39.887 --> 10:42.321
- He's fuckable.
- I'm sorry?

10:42.367 --> 10:45.643
It's an industry term. It means someone
might want to fuck him.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.599
Forefront Super Hans, sideline Jeremy.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.922
No, I didn't mean... I just meant...

10:50.967 --> 10:54.755
I thought you were a business brain,
Mark, but you're better than that.

10:54.807 --> 10:57.605
You're what my grandma would call
a real piece of shit.

10:57.647 --> 10:59.524
- Yeah?
- It's a great plan.

10:59.567 --> 11:03.116
Hans is the star, Jeremy's
a second stringer. Let's fuck him.

11:03.167 --> 11:06.557
That's our dick, that's Jeremy's arsehole,
we're fucking him.

11:06.607 --> 11:09.644
Look, Cally,
we don't have a shared dick.

11:09.687 --> 11:11.006
Not yet, anyway.

11:11.047 --> 11:12.719
How do you mean?

11:12.767 --> 11:16.077
Do you want to date?
Are you a dater?

11:16.127 --> 11:19.119
I have been out with women, so I guess...

11:19.167 --> 11:22.239
Friend of mine's doing a talk
over at a hippie shop in Ludlow,

11:22.287 --> 11:24.118
said I might pop in. Wanna come?

11:24.167 --> 11:26.362
OK. Sure.

11:26.407 --> 11:28.159
'Wow, I've got a date.

11:28.207 --> 11:30.482
'I'm a real piece of shit.

11:30.527 --> 11:33.041
'I bet those two things go
hand in hand.

11:33.087 --> 11:37.239
'Bet if I got it defrauding pensioners,
the pussy would really start rolling in. '

11:39.007 --> 11:42.636
Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed
I brought you to this.

11:42.687 --> 11:45.565
Past-life regression -
what a load of bullshit!

11:45.607 --> 11:47.598
It's fine, it was fun.

11:47.647 --> 11:51.526
People always say they were, like,
Napoleon or an Aztec princess.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.876
Come on.
Where are all the Chinese peasants?

11:53.927 --> 11:56.521
Where are the German toilet cleaners?

11:56.567 --> 12:00.526
'God, I can't believe
I'm dating someone I really like.

12:00.567 --> 12:03.286
'I've done it right!
I've done it right for once! '

12:03.327 --> 12:07.320
Hey, check out the crystal skulls.

12:07.367 --> 12:10.200
- Oh, God!
- I've read loads of books about them.

12:10.247 --> 12:11.316
'She's funny. '

12:11.367 --> 12:14.882
They were probably crafted by
the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis.

12:14.927 --> 12:16.963
They're powerful centres of healing.

12:17.007 --> 12:19.043
'Ls she still joking? '

12:19.087 --> 12:22.363
Oh, right, fascinating theory.

12:22.407 --> 12:25.558
Oh, come on, Mark!
The other stuff, no, but the skulls?

12:25.607 --> 12:30.556
How could you possibly make one of these
except by some kind of magic?

12:30.607 --> 12:33.883
In a factory? From glass?

12:33.927 --> 12:37.966
<i>- Oh, sure. Come on! Could you make that?
- No.</i>

12:38.007 --> 12:39.918
- Could anyone?
- Yes.

12:39.967 --> 12:43.118
Look, Mark, this is important to me.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.283
If we're going anywhere,

12:45.327 --> 12:48.763
I need you to tell me
you believe in crystal skulls.

12:48.807 --> 12:51.879
'Please don't make me believe in them! '
- Do you believe?

12:51.927 --> 12:55.317
I do believe in crystal skulls.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.358
And what do you believe about them?

12:57.407 --> 13:03.039
I believe that they were crafted by
the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis

13:03.087 --> 13:06.762
and that they're
powerful centres of healing.

13:06.807 --> 13:09.605
Yeah! That wasn't so hard, was it? Mwah!

13:09.647 --> 13:14.243
'Sorry, science. Sorry, Enlightenment.
Sorry, logic. '

13:16.487 --> 13:18.125
'Well, that was great...

13:18.167 --> 13:22.046
'apart from the crystal skull sending
out its invisible rays of bullshit.

13:22.087 --> 13:25.045
'I think that might be
my best ever sexual experience! '

13:25.087 --> 13:28.477
OK, I think we have to have a talk.
About the whole thing.

13:28.527 --> 13:30.165
I'm sorry, the whole?

13:30.207 --> 13:31.799
The whole sexual experience.

13:31.847 --> 13:35.681
I have to say
that was very disappointing.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.922
Oh, right.

13:37.967 --> 13:41.482
I don't mean to be rude, but is that
the kind of thing you usually do?

13:41.527 --> 13:43.643
Well, I suppose...

13:43.687 --> 13:44.802
in general...

13:44.847 --> 13:48.681
What exactly did I do... wrong?

13:48.727 --> 13:52.276
It was better than with Jeremy, though.
I had to stop him in the middle.

13:52.327 --> 13:54.477
You stopped Jeremy in the middle?

13:54.527 --> 13:56.961
Sorry, is this weird for you?
Do you want to know?

13:58.527 --> 14:00.563
I do... a bit.

14:00.607 --> 14:04.156
He's like a red setter
bounding after a tennis ball.

14:04.207 --> 14:09.076
You're like a captain
solemnly going down with his ship.

14:09.127 --> 14:11.846
Well... well, that's good to know.

14:11.887 --> 14:15.960
But we can try again if you're prepared
for me to tell you exactly what to do.

14:16.007 --> 14:18.726
That could be a good system.

14:18.767 --> 14:23.761
OK, now I'm gonna take your hand
and put it... there. Are you OK with that?

14:23.807 --> 14:25.559
Yeah.

14:25.607 --> 14:29.236
Now, I want you to move
your hand around like this.

14:29.287 --> 14:31.118
You can do that, right? It's easy.

14:31.167 --> 14:32.680
Not a problem.

14:32.727 --> 14:35.366
'Ls this humiliating?

14:35.407 --> 14:37.318
<i>' is a bit humiliating.</i>

14:37.367 --> 14:40.200
'I guess the upside is that what
I was doing before

14:40.247 --> 14:43.045
'was humiliating in a way
I wasn't even aware of. '

14:43.087 --> 14:46.477
OK, good! Let's begin the sex!

14:46.527 --> 14:48.279
I'll drive.

14:48.327 --> 14:50.841
'Oh, my God, this is brilliant!

14:50.887 --> 14:55.517
'I'm a sex robot servicing The One.
I always wondered what my fetish was

14:55.567 --> 14:57.398
'and it seems what truly turns me on

14:57.447 --> 15:00.280
'is being basically
absent for most of the sex act. '

15:00.327 --> 15:03.285
'Look at them all, the Christians.

15:03.327 --> 15:06.763
'It's not fair. I could be that happy
if I believed a lot of rubbish. '

15:06.807 --> 15:10.925
So, listen, Hans and I have had a big chat
and we're really into your idea.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.446
What idea?

15:12.487 --> 15:13.886
Getting rid of Jeremy.

15:13.927 --> 15:18.159
That wasn't... My idea was more
throw a bit more light on Hans

15:18.207 --> 15:20.721
and maybe give Jez a tambourine.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.564
Imagine you have a chocolate bar

15:22.607 --> 15:25.565
and half of it was
made of delicious milk chocolate

15:25.607 --> 15:28.075
and the other half was made of human shit,

15:28.127 --> 15:30.641
wouldn't you
break off the half made of shit?

15:30.687 --> 15:33.121
I really don't think that's
a fair analogy.

15:35.247 --> 15:36.885
'Is that Jeremy?

15:36.927 --> 15:39.395
'Ls he getting baptised?

15:39.447 --> 15:41.756
'I can't let him out of my sight
for a minute!

15:41.807 --> 15:45.356
Damn! The contract - the Chemicals
have read the appendix.

15:45.407 --> 15:47.967
I need to get on this.
I've got to get back.

15:48.007 --> 15:51.443
Would you do me a huge one
and tell Jeremy he's not playing tonight?

15:51.487 --> 15:53.205
What?

15:53.247 --> 15:57.286
No, no! It's not my job,
you're the manager. I'm just the roadie.

15:57.327 --> 16:01.684
It'll be better from you. You'll say
better lies about him not being terrible.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.878
Plus, real world, I might not
make the gig. Pick you up at five.

16:04.927 --> 16:07.646
'God, I'm the messenger.
Somebody shoot the messenger! '

16:07.687 --> 16:10.360
Hey, Mark! I just got baptised.

16:10.407 --> 16:13.205
This is Ronnie, he was my baptiser.
... Thanks, Ronnie.

16:13.247 --> 16:16.319
- Peace be with you, Jeremy.
- Peace be with you too, Ronnie.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.518
The organisers were keen for me
to get it done before the show.

16:19.567 --> 16:21.046
Initially, I was a bit iffy,

16:21.087 --> 16:24.762
but then I thought, "Gig in front of
hundreds of people? Fuck it!"

16:24.807 --> 16:26.843
Plus, there's like maybe a 1% chance

16:26.887 --> 16:29.355
that the whole Jesus thing
could be true - sorry...

16:29.407 --> 16:32.479
in which case I've got something
to pull out the bag on Judgment Day.

16:32.527 --> 16:34.438
Yes... Right.

16:34.487 --> 16:38.400
'Just walk him into the car park
and shoot him in the back of the head.

16:38.447 --> 16:42.235
'I'm Tony Soprano,
he's an FBI stripper. '

16:42.287 --> 16:45.199
I'm really looking forward
to the gig tonight after all.

16:45.247 --> 16:48.239
If Super Hans is into it, then I'm
into it. Everything's coming together,

16:48.287 --> 16:51.518
everything's finally, definitely
gonna be OK!

16:51.567 --> 16:54.479
'Oh God, he's on a raft,
floating towards Niagara Falls,

16:54.527 --> 16:57.883
'flicking through Heat magazine
with one hand down his trousers.

16:57.927 --> 17:00.077
'I've got to tell him. '

17:00.127 --> 17:02.595
Look, Jez.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.161
There's something I need to tell you.

17:05.207 --> 17:06.845
It's not good news.

17:06.887 --> 17:13.359
Um... Cally told me...
She and Super Hans, they want...

17:13.406 --> 17:16.240
You're out of the band.

17:16.287 --> 17:19.882
Me, out the band? What the fuck?

17:19.926 --> 17:23.203
'Might slip this one under the rug
while he's still reeling. '

17:23.247 --> 17:27.035
Yeah, cos we're going out,
and she told me she'd had this idea,

17:27.087 --> 17:29.726
and I said, "No, don't."
That's what I said...

17:29.767 --> 17:32.361
You're screwing Cally?
I'm out of the band?

17:32.407 --> 17:35.046
They can't just do this to me,
can they?

17:35.087 --> 17:37.476
'Hm. Seemed to get away
with the Cally thing. '

17:37.527 --> 17:41.122
- You'll have to break up with her.
- What? Oh... No, Jez!

17:41.167 --> 17:44.842
She's trying to shaft me, Mark.
You've got to dump her, it's a no-brainer.

17:44.887 --> 17:48.197
It is not a no-brainer.
I'll have to think about it.

17:48.247 --> 17:51.956
It's a brainer, it's a real brainer.
See, the thing is...

17:52.007 --> 17:55.636
I don't think I've ever
done sex right before.

17:55.687 --> 17:58.963
You're fine, mate.
Just stick with missionary.

17:59.007 --> 18:02.158
You're a sexual civilian.
Leave the disgusting stuff to me.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.004
Cally's teaching me.

18:04.047 --> 18:08.279
She... She gives me
second-by-second detailed instructions

18:08.327 --> 18:10.522
of what to put where for how long.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.683
That's cheating.

18:12.727 --> 18:15.400
Anyone can please a woman
if she tells you what to do.

18:15.447 --> 18:17.756
You're not allowed to ask,
that's the point!

18:17.807 --> 18:21.004
If I break up with her, I don't
see myself having good sex again.

18:21.047 --> 18:24.562
Unless I'm, like,
going on holiday to Hawaii

18:24.607 --> 18:27.201
and the plane crashes
and all my fellow survivors

18:27.247 --> 18:30.239
are women sex therapists
on their way to a conference.

18:30.287 --> 18:33.120
There'll probably be
male sex therapists there, too,

18:33.167 --> 18:35.476
and they'd love that!
All fucking each other

18:35.527 --> 18:39.918
and give each other tips
while I sit on a rock, wanking and crying.

18:39.967 --> 18:43.198
Yeah, whatever. Let's talk to Hans.
If we can get him onside,

18:43.247 --> 18:47.877
then maybe you can keep
your pathetic nookie lessons going. So...

18:47.927 --> 18:50.725
did Cally tell you
about her and me much?

18:50.767 --> 18:54.965
No. God, no. Don't worry.
Nothing like that.

18:55.007 --> 18:58.124
'She stopped him in the middle!
I'll save that for a rainy day.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.635
'That's money in the bank. '

19:02.407 --> 19:05.399
Right, what the fuck's going on?
Where's Cally?

19:05.447 --> 19:08.803
Why have you got drugs?

19:08.847 --> 19:13.637
Cally came through with a bit of herb
the Christos keep on the down-low.

19:13.687 --> 19:14.961
Bishopweed.

19:15.007 --> 19:19.285
Cally told Mark I'm out of the band.
What the hell's going on?

19:19.327 --> 19:21.716
It's a disgrace. I'm cut up about it.

19:21.767 --> 19:26.079
I told Cally. I said, "For me,
this is almost a resigning matter."

19:26.127 --> 19:29.119
- Right. So, are you going to walk?
- Almost did, mate.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.681
Almost fucking did. I kicked off big time.

19:31.727 --> 19:34.400
Then I thought,
"Maybe I can work from the inside."

19:34.447 --> 19:36.961
No point in both of us getting kicked out
the band.

19:37.007 --> 19:38.520
But we are the band.

19:38.567 --> 19:41.127
Look, all I'm hearing
is that you're out the band.

19:41.167 --> 19:44.921
That's what everyone's saying,
all I'm hearing. "Jez is out the band."

19:44.967 --> 19:47.037
- Now you're saying it.
- I'm quoting.

19:47.087 --> 19:49.647
Look, man. I'm really gutted,

19:49.687 --> 19:53.282
but me and Tara want to kick back
with a bit of Barchester.

19:53.327 --> 19:54.840
So maybe you should fuck off.

19:54.887 --> 19:57.765
Right. If that's the way it is, fine.

19:59.327 --> 20:01.522
Can I take a bit of drugs?

20:01.567 --> 20:07.119
Love to, mate. Love to, but
this is all mine and I want it all, so...

20:07.167 --> 20:08.566
got to be a no.

20:10.807 --> 20:12.240
Fucking hell.

20:13.807 --> 20:15.798
Maybe it's for the best, though, Jez.

20:15.847 --> 20:19.203
Maybe, solo, you can do
all the things you've always wanted.

20:19.247 --> 20:21.203
That rap thing with Howard Marks.

20:21.247 --> 20:24.045
I've got to talk Cally round.
You can be my spin doctor,

20:24.087 --> 20:27.318
tell her why I'm brilliant,
why I'm so essential to the band.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.244
OK, sure.

20:29.287 --> 20:32.279
Just remind me again,
why you are so brilliant?

20:32.327 --> 20:36.366
I mean, I know why,
but it's good to have sound bites.

20:37.847 --> 20:40.600
Cally! Cally!

20:43.367 --> 20:45.164
No, Jeremy, you can't just...

20:45.207 --> 20:47.038
'Shit. He's entering the chamber,

20:47.087 --> 20:50.124
'the sacred chamber of satisfactory sex. '

20:50.167 --> 20:54.240
Jeremy, let's just go.
Or you could leave her a very frank note.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.279
Or... we could piss on something.

20:57.327 --> 20:58.760
No, Jez.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.957
Yes, Mark. Come on, it's all fucked.

21:01.007 --> 21:04.363
This is rock'n'roll. She screwed me over,
now it's her turn.

21:04.407 --> 21:07.046
Let's fuck this place up.
We're the hammer of the gods!

21:07.087 --> 21:09.078
'Oh yeah, take that, teabag tin. '

21:09.127 --> 21:10.719
Jez, no!

21:10.767 --> 21:13.839
She smashed my dreams,
let's smash her caravan!

21:15.447 --> 21:16.880
Come on!

21:16.927 --> 21:20.761
'I could make the best of it,
go for a freebie on the skull.

21:20.807 --> 21:24.322
'He'll get the blame,
I'll bank mate points. I'm golden.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.927
'Ha-ha! Unlucky, pal. I win! '

21:26.967 --> 21:28.844
Oh, fuck!

21:28.887 --> 21:30.559
'The revenge of Atlantis. '

21:30.607 --> 21:32.120
Oh, this feels good.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.761
This just feels so right, you know?

21:34.807 --> 21:38.800
Jez, how long are you gonna keep
going with the orgy of destruction?

21:38.847 --> 21:40.724
I'd rather not be here when she turns up.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.122
Oh, yeah, man. No, you go.
I'm gonna stay.

21:44.407 --> 21:46.602
I'm gonna see the look on her face.

21:46.647 --> 21:49.525
No-one screws with the Jez man.

21:50.887 --> 21:53.560
'Hope she's not too upset. Fuck it!

21:53.607 --> 21:56.838
'If it's healing powers are so legendary,
it can fix itself. '

22:01.127 --> 22:04.802
'Christian security? What's he gonna do?
Excommunicate me?

22:04.847 --> 22:09.204
'This is gonna be good.
Rub her double-crossing face in it. '

22:09.247 --> 22:11.636
- Jez, I've been looking for you.
- I'm sure you have.

22:11.687 --> 22:14.724
I got a call from Super Hans.
He's having an ego attack.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.760
He's driving to Festivus with all the
windows down, shouting his own name.

22:18.807 --> 22:21.480
Reckons he'll make a supergroup
out of Hard-Fi and Kaiser Chiefs.

22:21.527 --> 22:23.483
He's talked about that before.

22:23.527 --> 22:26.166
So, the thing is,
do you want to play the gig, solo?

22:26.207 --> 22:28.402
Well, yes!

22:28.447 --> 22:31.007
Brilliant. So, let's talk set lists.

22:31.047 --> 22:34.005
There's something you should know.
'Am I gonna do this? '

22:34.047 --> 22:36.163
Mark. He went mental.

22:38.847 --> 22:41.202
Oh, my God!

22:41.247 --> 22:42.521
'It's a mess. '

22:42.567 --> 22:44.444
What the hell happened?

22:44.487 --> 22:46.398
This is classic Mark, I'm afraid.

22:46.447 --> 22:48.642
He does this sort of thing
the whole time.

22:48.687 --> 22:53.317
He's passive-aggressive.
He won't say anything, he just smashes.

22:53.367 --> 22:56.723
But my skull, my crystal skull!

22:56.767 --> 22:58.405
Yeah. He hates the skulls.

22:58.447 --> 23:02.122
He smashed it and then cut his hand
in a kind of mad fury.

23:02.167 --> 23:03.759
God! How could he?

23:03.807 --> 23:07.356
Well, he hates being told
what to do in bed.

23:07.407 --> 23:10.524
He hates you
for pushing me out of the band.

23:10.567 --> 23:14.924
I was, like, "Dude, these things happen."
But he was like, "No-o-o!"

23:14.967 --> 23:17.640
- That's when he did the eggs.
- Really?

23:17.687 --> 23:22.556
Yeah. He's weird, twisted, vindictive.
He draws horrible cartoons of you

23:22.607 --> 23:28.364
and then wraps them up in sausage meat
and calls you a sausage-muncher.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.886
Jesus!

23:29.927 --> 23:34.239
On the bright side, he wanted to shit
on the sofa but I managed to stop him.

23:39.047 --> 23:42.801
'First proper gig.
Dicked over Mark, but that's fine.

23:42.847 --> 23:46.476
'This is worth it.
He's what it's all about.

23:46.527 --> 23:48.563
'He's having a great time. '

23:52.527 --> 23:54.245
'Ah, there she is.

23:54.287 --> 23:55.800
'Leaving with The One.

23:55.847 --> 23:57.678
'Not a bad weekend, all told.

23:57.727 --> 24:01.356
'Got myself a girlfriend,
had the best sex of my life,

24:01.407 --> 24:04.365
'did my bit to delay
the dawning of the Age of Aquarius

24:04.407 --> 24:06.921
'with my trusty friend, the house brick.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.798
'She's giving me the finger.

24:08.847 --> 24:12.123
'The One is giving me the finger.

24:12.167 --> 24:15.603
'Ah, yes, that's more like it.
The One is gone.

24:15.647 --> 24:19.560
'The familiar gut-punch
of pain and confusion is back.

24:19.607 --> 24:21.086
'Hello, old friend. '

24:29.087 --> 24:30.964
<i>Paranoia, paranoia</i>

24:31.007 --> 24:33.999
<i>Everybody's comin' to get me</i>

24:34.047 --> 24:36.925
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

24:36.967 --> 24:42.121
<i>I'm runnin' underground
with the moles, diggin' holes</i>
