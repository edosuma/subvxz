WEBVTT

00:03.933 --> 00:05.400
- HEY, POWDER PUFF.

00:09.833 --> 00:13.767
THAT'S RIGHT;
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:15.133 --> 00:17.300
- I GOT A RASH ON MY LEG.

00:17.300 --> 00:21.567
- OH, WELL, THEN BY ALL MEANS,
TOUCH ALL OUR FOOD.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.833
- HERE'S THE OINTMENT,
FRANK.

00:25.833 --> 00:26.867
- OH, THANKS.

00:26.867 --> 00:28.000
- HI.
- HI.

00:29.100 --> 00:32.133
YEAH, DAD, THAT'S TO GO.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.267
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

00:36.967 --> 00:40.300
- EWW, YOU'RE ALL WET.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

00:40.300 --> 00:41.767
- YEAH, I WAS IN
THE GIANTS' LOCKER ROOM.

00:41.767 --> 00:44.267
I ENDED UP IN THE SHOWER
WITH JOE TAGGART.

00:49.333 --> 00:50.933
DOING INTERVIEWS.

00:50.933 --> 00:53.667
BUT LISTEN TO THIS--
IT'S AFTER PRACTICE, RIGHT?

00:53.667 --> 00:55.700
AND--AND EVERYONE'S
PRETTY MUCH CLEARED OUT.

00:55.700 --> 00:59.067
AND I HEAR THE SHOWER
STILL GOING, SO I LOOK IN.

00:59.067 --> 01:02.000
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING IN FOR?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.567
- NOTHING.

01:03.567 --> 01:05.233
SHOWER'S STILL GOING.
IT'S A WASTE OF WATER.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.433
ANYWAY, IT'S JOE TAGGART,

01:07.433 --> 01:10.433
AND HE'S SITTING ON THE FLOOR
WITH HIS HEAD DOWN,

01:10.433 --> 01:11.933
AND THE WATER'S GOING ON HIM,

01:11.933 --> 01:14.500
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT HE SAYS TO ME?

01:14.500 --> 01:16.367
- DO MY BACK?

01:19.567 --> 01:21.467
- HE TELLS ME
HE JUST FOUND OUT THAT

01:21.467 --> 01:24.200
HIS FAVORITE RECEIVER,
RICKY FREEMAN,

01:24.200 --> 01:26.233
WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
HIS BEST FRIEND,

01:26.233 --> 01:29.067
HAS BEEN WITH HIS WIFE.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.500
- NO.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.167
- WOMEN.

01:32.167 --> 01:34.200
- OH, SO YOU AUTOMATICALLY
BLAME THE WOMAN?

01:34.200 --> 01:35.900
- SHE'S CHEATING
ON HER HUSBAND.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.133
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE FRIEND?

01:37.133 --> 01:39.667
HE HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.833
- WELL, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.900
GOD PROGRAMMED MAN
TO SOW HIS SEED WHERE HE MAY.

01:44.900 --> 01:51.700
HE PROGRAMMED WOMEN
TO LIMIT THE CROP TO ONE FARMER.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.567
THIS BROAD DIDN'T
GET WITH THE PROGRAM.

01:55.567 --> 01:57.733
- WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS UNHAPPY.
DID YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

01:57.733 --> 01:59.633
- HE TOLD ME THAT
EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.633
- WELL, MAYBE HE WAS OUT
OF TOUCH WITH HER FEELINGS.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.300
- WELL, MAYBE HE HAD
A LOT ON HIS MIND.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.400
- WELL, MAYBE SHE NEEDED
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.367
- MAYBE ALL HER TALKING
WAS COMPLAINING.

02:08.367 --> 02:09.700
- WELL, MAYBE HE WAS
ON THE ROAD A LOT.

02:09.700 --> 02:12.667
- MAYBE HE HAD
TO MAKE A LIVING.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.100
- MAYBE ALL HE DID
WHEN HE WAS HOME

02:14.100 --> 02:16.433
IS SIT ON THE COUCH
AND WATCH TV.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.367
- WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO LEARN, RAY?

02:22.367 --> 02:25.267
YOU CAN'T TALK SPORTS
WITH THE WIFE.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.500
- DID YOU DO THAT YOURSELF?

02:35.933 --> 02:37.167
- THEY'RE COMING.

02:37.167 --> 02:40.767
[chorale music]

03:00.133 --> 03:02.600
[music skips and stops]

03:04.967 --> 03:07.433
[heart beats]

03:09.800 --> 03:12.267
[chorale music resumes]

03:34.467 --> 03:35.467
- HEY.

03:35.467 --> 03:36.867
- HEY.

03:36.867 --> 03:38.600
FAKE SKIN.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.000
WHAT'S TODAY, THURSDAY?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.267
- YEAH.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.067
- YOU WANT SOMETHING?

03:51.067 --> 03:52.733
- NO, NO, I JUST WANTED
TO RETURN THIS OINTMENT.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.667
- OH, YEAH.
HOW'D THAT WORK OUT FOR YOU?

03:54.667 --> 03:56.900
- GOOD. GOOD.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.967
YOU DIDN'T COME DOWN HERE
TO SHOW ME, DID YOU?

03:58.967 --> 04:00.733
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:00.733 --> 04:03.200
YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING
TO GARVIN AND STAN,

04:03.200 --> 04:04.833
AND THEY READ YOUR COLUMN,

04:04.833 --> 04:07.567
AND THEY WERE GOING ON
ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY LIKED IT.

04:07.567 --> 04:11.933
- OH, YEAH? OH.
WELL, TELL THEM I SAID THANKS.

04:11.933 --> 04:13.100
- WELL, ME TOO.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.467
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
IT WAS GOOD TOO.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.033
YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER.

04:17.033 --> 04:20.133
I EVER TELL YOU THAT?

04:20.133 --> 04:22.067
- NO.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.800
- YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.667
- WELL, THANKS.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.933
- SO WHAT YOU WORKING ON
THERE TODAY?

04:28.933 --> 04:30.300
- UH, NOTHING.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.933
JUST SOMETHING
ON KEN GRIFFEY JR.

04:31.933 --> 04:33.100
- OH, YEAH?

04:33.100 --> 04:35.800
- YEAH.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.267
YEAH, HE'S BEEN IN A SLUMP,

04:37.267 --> 04:39.933
SO HE CALLED HIS FATHER
TO HELP HIM WITH HIS SWING.

04:39.933 --> 04:41.833
DID YOU KNOW
THAT HE DOES THAT?

04:41.833 --> 04:42.967
- OH, YEAH?

04:42.967 --> 04:45.167
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD FATHER.

04:45.167 --> 04:46.800
HEY, HEY, YOU REMEMBER
HOW I TOOK YOU

04:46.800 --> 04:48.367
TO THE PLAYGROUND
THERE AT THE SCHOOL

04:48.367 --> 04:51.067
AND I HIT FLY BALLS
TO YOU?

04:51.067 --> 04:52.667
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.933
I REMEMBER THAT DAY.

04:55.933 --> 04:57.467
- YEAH, I LIKED THAT.

04:57.467 --> 05:00.667
ME AND YOU SHOULD
DO THAT AGAIN SOMETIME.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.967
- THAT IS WEIRD.

05:06.967 --> 05:08.300
- IT WAS.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.967
IT'S LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO BE...

05:09.967 --> 05:11.967
A FATHER OR SOMETHING.

05:11.967 --> 05:13.267
I DON'T KNOW.

05:13.267 --> 05:15.067
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS,
HE'S BEEN ALL...

05:15.067 --> 05:17.200
PLEASANT.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.633
- PLEASANT.

05:18.633 --> 05:22.133
WAS HE FEVERISH?

05:22.133 --> 05:23.533
- REMEMBER
THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKER

05:23.533 --> 05:25.367
IN "RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT,"

05:25.367 --> 05:28.667
THE--THE GUY WHO GOT THE METAL
ROD STUCK IN HIS BRAIN?

05:28.667 --> 05:32.500
YOU KNOW, HE LIVED,
BUT HIS PERSONALITY CHANGED.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.733
- LET ME GUESS.
HE WAS SUDDENLY MORE IRRITABLE.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.433
- YES.

05:36.433 --> 05:39.300
YES, BUT WITH MY FATHER,
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.867
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S NICE.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.600
IT'S...WEIRD.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.100
AT FIRST, IT SEEMED FAKE,
YOU KNOW, BUT THEN...

05:46.100 --> 05:48.033
I DON'T KNOW,
WE WERE TALKING,

05:48.033 --> 05:50.733
AND HE WAS LISTENING.

05:50.733 --> 05:52.767
YEAH.

05:52.767 --> 05:55.267
IT WAS...NICE.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.700
I DON'T KNOW.
KIND OF LIKED IT.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.867
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
IT MIGHT BE?

05:58.867 --> 06:00.433
YOUR FATHER'S GETTING OLDER,

06:00.433 --> 06:02.400
AND THIS IS HOW
HE'S TRYING TO CONNECT.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.767
I MEAN, FRANK'S
NOT THE KIND OF GUY

06:03.767 --> 06:05.600
THAT WOULD CHANGE
IF YOU TOLD HIM TO,

06:05.600 --> 06:09.367
BUT MAYBE HE'S COME AROUND
TO IT BY HIMSELF.

06:09.367 --> 06:12.100
- OR THERE'S A ROD
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

06:19.133 --> 06:20.900
- MA, I DO MY OWN
SHOPPING NOW.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.300
I DON'T NEED ALL THIS.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.933
- I SAW YOUR REFRIGERATOR
IN THAT APARTMENT.

06:24.933 --> 06:27.100
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
THIS IS BEEF STROGANOFF,

06:27.100 --> 06:28.800
AND YOU EAT IT
WITH THE NOODLES.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.500
OOH, AND I GOT YOUR FAVORITE,

06:31.500 --> 06:34.733
STEAK AND MACARONI
AND HAM AND CHEESE ALFREDO.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.000
- ALL RIGHT, MA.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.167
WELL, I APPRECIATE IT.

06:37.167 --> 06:38.933
YOU KNOW,
WITH MY SCHEDULE,

06:38.933 --> 06:40.700
IT'S HARD TO EAT HEALTHY.

06:42.667 --> 06:44.333
OH, BABY.

06:44.333 --> 06:45.733
- NO. N-NO, NO, ROBBIE. NO.

06:45.733 --> 06:50.733
THAT'S NOT FOR YOU.
CHICKEN IS FOR RAYMOND.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.133
- OF COURSE.

06:52.133 --> 06:54.733
RAYMOND GETS THE CHICKEN.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.167
- HEY.
- HEY.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.800
- IS DAD AROUND?

06:59.800 --> 07:01.067
- NO. YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.600
HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO THE BARBER SHOP.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.933
- BARBER?

07:03.933 --> 07:06.033
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST GO DOWN
TO THE BOWLING ALLEY

07:06.033 --> 07:07.767
AND STICK HIS HEAD
IN THE BALL BUFFER?

07:07.767 --> 07:10.067
[laughter]

07:13.567 --> 07:14.867
- COME ON, MAN.

07:14.867 --> 07:18.033
THAT'S A LITTLE ROUGH.

07:18.033 --> 07:19.333
- WHAT?

07:19.333 --> 07:20.733
- LISTEN, LISTEN,

07:20.733 --> 07:23.767
HAS--HAS DAD BEEN
ACTING DIFFERENT LATELY?

07:25.633 --> 07:27.200
- YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

07:27.200 --> 07:29.067
HE HAS BEEN
IN A VERY GOOD MOOD.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.500
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.900
AND I NOTICED HE
HASN'T BEEN QUITE SO CHEAP.

07:33.900 --> 07:37.267
LIKE TODAY, HE'S NOT ONLY
GETTING A HAIRCUT,

07:37.267 --> 07:39.033
HE'S ALSO GETTING A SHAVE.

07:39.033 --> 07:42.233
- AH, I THINK IF YOU'RE
CHARGING DAD FOR A HAIRCUT,

07:42.233 --> 07:44.133
YOU'D THROW IN THE SHAVE.

07:49.967 --> 07:53.033
- I DON'T KNOW, LATELY DAD'S
BEEN ACTING DIFFERENT TO ME,

07:53.033 --> 07:55.867
YOU KNOW, LIKE...NICER.

07:55.867 --> 08:00.233
- YEAH? TYPICAL.

08:00.233 --> 08:02.600
- SO--SO HE HASN'T
BEEN ACTING NICER TO YOU?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.733
- SURPRISING,
ISN'T IT, RAY? HUH?

08:11.233 --> 08:12.933
- ROBBIE...

08:12.933 --> 08:14.367
CHICKEN DOESN'T GO THERE.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.733
COME ON, GIVE ME THAT.

08:15.733 --> 08:17.900
COME ON.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.633
AND IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

08:20.633 --> 08:24.067
IT'S FOR RAYMOND.

08:24.067 --> 08:26.633
- I'M GOOD.

08:26.633 --> 08:28.100
[doorbell rings]

08:28.100 --> 08:30.567
- OOH. RAYMOND, WOULD YOU GET
THAT FOR ME, PLEASE, HON?

08:30.567 --> 08:32.067
- YEAH.

08:32.067 --> 08:34.000
- GIVE ME THAT.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.167
- RAYMOND SAID
I COULD HAVE IT.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.800
YOU'D RATHER THROW IT IN
THE GARBAGE THAN GIVE IT TO ME?

08:47.800 --> 08:50.267
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU'LL LEARN.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.100
- HEY.
- HEY.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.700
- HEY, STAN.
HEY, GARVIN.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.500
- HEY, RAY'S HERE!

09:02.500 --> 09:05.100
[cackles]

09:05.100 --> 09:08.600
- [mimicking]
HA HA HA!

09:08.600 --> 09:09.600
- HI, RAY.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.800
WE GOT THE MONEY
WE OWE YOUR OLD MAN.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.100
- FRANK!

09:12.100 --> 09:13.100
- HE'S NOT HERE.
HE'S NOT HERE.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.433
HE WENT TO THE BARBER SHOP.

09:14.433 --> 09:15.600
HE'S GETTING A HAIRCUT
AND A SHAVE.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.233
- WELL, HOW DO YOU
LIKE THAT?

09:17.233 --> 09:19.267
DIAMOND JIM BRADY'S
GETTING A SHAVE TOO.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.300
I GUESS WE'RE PAYING
FOR THAT SHAVE.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.667
- HEY, AIN'T TONIGHT
YOUR POKER NIGHT?

09:22.667 --> 09:24.200
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE IT TO HIM THEN?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.167
- I'M NOT GAMBLING
WITH HIM ANYMORE.

09:26.167 --> 09:27.633
- ME NEITHER.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.300
I NEVER SEEN A GUY
ON SUCH A HOT STREAK.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.333
- IT'S NOT NATURAL.

09:31.333 --> 09:32.700
IT'S SUPERNATURAL.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.200
- YOU KNOW WHY?

09:34.200 --> 09:36.767
'CAUSE HE'S A WITCH.
THAT'S WHAT HE IS, A WITCH.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.400
- NOT A WITCH, A WARLOCK.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.700
- NOBODY SAYS WARLOCK ANYMORE.
THEY'RE ALL WITCHES.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.200
- OKAY, GUYS.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.967
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
HE'S A MALE WITCH?

09:43.967 --> 09:45.700
- YOU DON'T SAY MALE WITCH.
IT'S LIKE MALE NURSE.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.067
NOWADAYS,
THEY'RE ALL JUST NURSES.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.367
- I'LL SEE THAT
HE GETS THAT.

09:48.367 --> 09:49.900
- THEN I SAY
HE'S A WITCH DOCTOR.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.467
I SWEAR, RAY, HE PUT
SOME KIND OF VOODOO CURSE

09:52.467 --> 09:53.867
ON JOE TAGGART LAST WEEK.

09:53.867 --> 09:55.567
- YEAH, HE KEPT SAYING
HE HAD THIS FEELING

09:55.567 --> 09:57.967
THAT JOE TAGGART
WAS OFF HIS GAME.

09:57.967 --> 10:00.733
- WAIT A MINUTE; I THOUGHT YOU
WERE TALKING ABOUT POKER.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.633
- NO, NO.
WE'VE BEEN BETTING SPORTS.

10:02.633 --> 10:05.067
- YEAH, YESTERDAY YOUR FATHER
TAKES SEATTLE OVER THE YANKS,

10:05.067 --> 10:06.233
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE,

10:06.233 --> 10:07.467
GRIFFEY BREAKS OUT
OF HIS SLUMP

10:07.467 --> 10:09.367
AND KNOCKS IN
A COUPLE OF HOMERS.

10:09.367 --> 10:11.067
- HOW COULD HE KNOW
ABOUT GRIFFEY?

10:11.067 --> 10:12.500
COME ON, GARVIN,

10:12.500 --> 10:14.200
LET'S CATCH UP TO HIM
AT THE BARBER SHOP.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.867
- UH, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

10:15.867 --> 10:18.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL SEE THAT HE GETS THAT.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.367
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL DO IT.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.233
- NO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

10:21.233 --> 10:24.133
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

10:24.133 --> 10:25.800
- FINE WITH ME.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.167
- HE'S NOT A GRACIOUS WINNER,
YOUR FATHER.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.600
YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS?

10:30.600 --> 10:33.367
HE'S A WITCH WHO MADE A PACT
WITH THE DEVIL.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.100
- HE DIDN'T MAKE A PACT
WITH THE DEVIL.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.700
HE IS THE DEVIL.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.300
SATAN!
BEELZEBUB!

10:40.300 --> 10:43.233
THIS HOUSE
SHOULD HAVE 666!

10:43.233 --> 10:45.167
HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU, RAY.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.567
SAY HI TO YOUR MOM.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.433
- AH, I FEEL LIKE
I'M BACK IN THE WOMB.

11:01.667 --> 11:04.233

11:04.233 --> 11:07.033
HOW COME YOU FINALLY

11:14.167 --> 11:16.433
SAL, THIS IS MY SON RAY.

11:16.433 --> 11:17.633
- A SON?

11:17.633 --> 11:22.767
15 YEARS, YOU NEVER TOLD ME
YOU HAD A SON.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.600
- I GOT TWO.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.733
THIS ONE'S A SPORTSWRITER,
A GREAT SPORTSWRITER.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.000
- AW, COME ON, DAD.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.133
- AH, DON'T BE MODEST.

11:30.133 --> 11:31.767
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.200
YOU EVER HEAR OF RAY BARONE?

11:34.200 --> 11:35.567
- RAY BARONE?

11:35.567 --> 11:37.333
YOU'RE RAY BARONE'S FATHER?

11:37.333 --> 11:41.067
15 YEARS, YOU NEVER TOLD ME
YOUR LAST NAME.

11:41.067 --> 11:45.067
- I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.367
- HEY, STAN AND GARVIN
CAME BY,

11:46.367 --> 11:47.833
AND THEY, UH, WANTED ME

11:47.833 --> 11:49.367
- AH. THANK YOU.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.933
- YEAH. WHAT'D YOU,

11:51.933 --> 11:53.800

11:53.800 --> 11:55.467
HEY, RAY, HOW ABOUT A SHAVE?

11:55.467 --> 11:57.467
- NO, UH, I DON'T THINK SO.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.967
- HEY, I KNOW THIS IS NOT
THE KIND OF HIGHFALUTIN SALON

11:59.967 --> 12:02.467
YOU USUALLY GO TO.

12:02.467 --> 12:06.167
- THE HAIR BARN?

12:06.167 --> 12:08.167
- COME ON.
WE'LL TALK.

12:08.167 --> 12:09.833
- OH, YOU--
YOU WANNA TALK.

12:09.833 --> 12:12.633
ALL RIGHT, GREAT, YEAH,
LET'S TALK, YEAH.

12:12.633 --> 12:13.700
- YEAH, MY TREAT.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.900

12:14.900 --> 12:18.200
IN THAT CASE,
GIVE ME A PERM.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.667

12:31.467 --> 12:36.500
FATHER AND SON
GETTING A SHAVE TOGETHER.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.633
AH...

12:37.633 --> 12:39.700
MY SON WON'T EVEN
TALK TO ME.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.100
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S THAT METAL BOLT

12:42.100 --> 12:43.967
HE'S GOT STUCK
THROUGH HIS TONGUE.

12:43.967 --> 12:46.867
I MEAN...

12:46.867 --> 12:48.267
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.800
A FATHER SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TALK TO HIS SON.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.267
RIGHT, SON?

12:52.267 --> 12:53.767
- RIGHT.
RIGHT, DAD.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.867
WE'VE BEEN HAVING
SOME REAL GOOD CONVERSATIONS

12:55.867 --> 12:56.900
LATELY, HAVEN'T WE?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.833
- WE SURE HAVE.
- YEAH.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.733
YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN ENRICHING.

13:01.733 --> 13:04.633
HAVE THEY BEEN ENRICHING
FOR YOU, DAD?

13:04.633 --> 13:07.800
AAH! OH, MY GOD!

13:07.800 --> 13:09.700
THAT'S HOT!

13:09.700 --> 13:15.033

13:15.033 --> 13:17.000

SENSITIVE SKIN?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.867
- YEAH, IT'S SENSITIVE
TO FIRE.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.300
[whirring]

13:23.300 --> 13:27.067
- SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON THERE TODAY, RAY?

13:27.067 --> 13:29.233
- HOCKEY. HOCKEY.
THE AVALANCHE.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.900
THEY'RE IN TOWN
TO PLAY THE RANGERS.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.867
- OH, YEAH?
THE RANGERS DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

13:33.867 --> 13:36.800
- UH, I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.900
- OH, YEAH? WHY?

13:38.900 --> 13:40.533
- WELL, NOBODY KNOW--

14:00.033 --> 14:02.700
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT, UH...

14:02.700 --> 14:05.767
PATRICK ROY.

14:05.767 --> 14:08.033
- THE AVALANCHE GOALIE?

14:08.033 --> 14:09.033
- YEAH, HE'S OUT.

14:09.033 --> 14:10.400
KNEE PROBLEMS.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.067
I THINK THE RANGERS
GOT A PRETTY GOOD SHOT.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.600
- YEAH, NO KIDDING?

14:15.600 --> 14:16.967
UH, THANKS, SAL.

14:16.967 --> 14:18.167

14:18.167 --> 14:21.300
AHH, FEEL LIKE A BABY'S BUTT.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.633

14:22.633 --> 14:24.133
- I GOTTA SEE A GUY

14:24.133 --> 14:25.700
- I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA TALK.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.033
- HERE YOU GO, BUDDY,
AND HERE...

14:28.033 --> 14:29.733
THIS IS FOR
MY FAVORITE SON.

14:29.733 --> 14:32.667
[honking noise]

14:32.667 --> 14:34.833
- [chuckles]

14:34.833 --> 14:38.167
- FATHER AND SON,
IT'S A SACRED THING.

14:38.167 --> 14:42.533
WHAT YOU TWO GOT:
BEAUTIFUL.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.300
NOW, DON'T MOVE YOUR HEAD.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.433
THIS IS VERY SHARP, HONEY.

14:52.633 --> 14:54.333
- SO YOUR FATHER'S
JUST BEEN USING YOU?

14:54.333 --> 14:57.333
- YEP.
I'M JUST A TIP SHEET TO HIM.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.967
- YEAH.
[chuckles]

14:58.967 --> 15:00.833
- WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

15:00.833 --> 15:04.767
- I THOUGHT DAD
LIKED YOU MORE.

15:04.767 --> 15:09.333
WELCOME HOME.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.600
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, ALLY,
BEDTIME.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.200
- DADDY, WILL YOU
TELL ME A STORY?

15:12.200 --> 15:15.000
- YEAH. YEAH, HERE.
JUMP ON.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.433
OHH!

15:16.433 --> 15:18.833
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY

15:18.833 --> 15:22.100
WHO HAD
A VERY MEAN FATHER.

15:23.967 --> 15:26.800
- ROBERT, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.767
I THINK I FIGURED OUT

15:28.767 --> 15:31.667
WHY YOUR FATHER'S BEEN
ACTING SO DIFFERENTLY.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.033
IT ALL ADDS UP.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.967
I MEAN, THE PLEASANTNESS
AND THE SPENDING

15:35.967 --> 15:37.900
AND THE HAIRCUT.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.200
HE'S FOOLING AROUND.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.400
- FOOLING AROUND?
COME ON.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.767
- I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

15:43.767 --> 15:45.333
IF THAT WEASEL THINKS
HE CAN STAY WITH ME

15:45.333 --> 15:47.300
AND KEEP SOME CHIPPY
ON THE SIDE, BOY--

15:47.300 --> 15:48.300
- WHERE'S RAY?

15:48.300 --> 15:49.667
- WHO IS IT, FRANK,

15:49.667 --> 15:50.667
HARRIET LICHTMAN?

15:50.667 --> 15:51.667
- RAY!

15:51.667 --> 15:52.767
- OH, SURE, SURE,

15:52.767 --> 15:54.700
YOU'RE JUST HER BRIDGE PARTNER,
HUH?

15:54.700 --> 15:57.000
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A WIG SHE WEARS.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.433
- RAY!

15:58.433 --> 16:00.300
- HEY, KEEP IT DOWN.
THE KIDS ARE IN BED.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.767
- RAY!
- WHAT?

16:01.767 --> 16:03.633
- MOMMY!

16:03.633 --> 16:06.700
- YOU'RE KILLING ME,
FRANK.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.200
- HEY, DAD.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.833
WHAT, DID YOU COME BY TO HAVE
ANOTHER CHAT?

16:10.833 --> 16:13.367
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU CAN COME
CRAWLING BACK, FRANK,

16:13.367 --> 16:15.367
'CAUSE LIPS THAT TOUCH
HARRIET LICHTMAN

16:15.367 --> 16:18.833
WILL NEVER TOUCH MINE.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.933
- QUIET, MARIE.

16:21.933 --> 16:23.200
I GO TO THE LODGE TONIGHT,

16:23.200 --> 16:24.800
I TURN ON
THE RANGER-AVALANCHE GAME.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.533
IT'S IN OVERTIME.

16:26.533 --> 16:30.300
GUESS WHO'S PLAYING
GOALIE FOR THE AVALANCHE!

16:30.300 --> 16:32.567
- WHY, I BELIEVE
THAT'S PATRICK ROY.

16:35.233 --> 16:39.300
- DOES ANYBODY CARE
ABOUT ME?

16:39.300 --> 16:41.133
- MA, DAD'S NOT CHEATING ON YOU.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.667
HE'S CHEATING ON RAY.

16:42.667 --> 16:43.867
- WHAT?

16:43.867 --> 16:46.733
- YOU TOLD ME HE WASN'T
GONNA PLAY TONIGHT!

16:46.733 --> 16:48.500
- MUST HAVE GOT IT WRONG.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.033
WHOOPS.

16:51.033 --> 16:53.767
- I GOT A LOT OF MONEY
ON THIS GAME.

16:53.767 --> 16:54.900
- MONEY?

16:54.900 --> 16:56.333
DAD, YOU WOULDN'T BE BETTING

16:56.333 --> 16:59.233
WITH INFORMATION
I GAVE YOU, WOULD YOU?

17:00.567 --> 17:04.567
- YOU SET ME UP.

17:04.567 --> 17:05.733
- YES, SIR.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.967
- I'M FAMILY.

17:06.967 --> 17:08.967
YOU NEVER GO
AGAINST THE FAMILY.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.300
- WHAT FAMILY?
YOU USED ME.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.700
COMING AROUND HERE
BEING ALL WARM AND CUDDLY,

17:13.700 --> 17:15.267
COMPLIMENTS OUT THE WAZOO.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.600
YOU JUST WANTED
INSIDE INFORMATION

17:16.600 --> 17:20.033
SO YOU COULD BET
GUYS AT THE LODGE.

17:20.033 --> 17:23.033
- SO YOU'RE NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH HARRIET LICHTMAN?

17:25.100 --> 17:28.000
- WAS THERE AN OFFER?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.333
- SEE, MA...

17:30.333 --> 17:33.800
I TOLD YOU IT WAS NOTHING.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.300
- OH.

17:35.300 --> 17:39.500
YOU WOULD THINK
I'D BE HAPPIER.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.867
COME ON, ROBBIE.

17:40.867 --> 17:44.100
- HEY, DAD IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN USE ME FOR STUFF,

17:44.100 --> 17:47.167
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T MIND
THE OCCASIONAL COMPLIMENT,

17:47.167 --> 17:49.767
EVEN IF IT IS FROM YOUR WAZOO.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.167
- OH, A POWER PLAY, DAD.

17:54.167 --> 17:55.333
YOUR RANGERS ARE IN TROUBLE.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.567
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

17:56.567 --> 17:58.333
- DAMN YOU!

17:58.333 --> 18:01.467
COME ON!
CENTER IT! CENTER IT!

18:01.467 --> 18:04.033
- HIT HIM OFF THE PUCK!
- THERE IT IS!

18:04.033 --> 18:05.567
GO!

18:05.567 --> 18:06.867
- SHOOTS, SCORES!

18:06.867 --> 18:09.567
- YES!
- RANGERS WIN!

18:09.567 --> 18:12.633
- YES! YEEES!

18:19.233 --> 18:20.900
YOU SEE THIS?

18:20.900 --> 18:25.933
THIS IS PROOF OF GOD HERE.

18:25.933 --> 18:27.767
YOU GO AGAINST
YOUR FATHER,

18:27.767 --> 18:30.000
THOU ART SMITED.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.067
I TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

18:37.067 --> 18:38.600
I-I'LL...

18:38.600 --> 18:41.700
I'LL SPLIT THE MONEY
WITH YOU.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.933
COME ON, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SAY NO TO 15 GRAND.

18:44.933 --> 18:48.267
- 15 GRAND?

18:48.267 --> 18:50.100
- OKAY, 80 BUCKS.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.367
- DON'T TALK TO ME ANYMORE.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.100
- WHAT DO YOU
GET SO MAD ABOUT?

18:58.100 --> 18:59.700
YOU KNOW, WE HAD FUN,
DIDN'T WE?

18:59.700 --> 19:01.900
WE WERE HANGING OUT,
PALLING AROUND,

19:01.900 --> 19:04.167
HAVING CONVERSATIONS.

19:04.167 --> 19:06.467
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?
I DID HAVE FUN.

19:06.467 --> 19:09.833
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING
TO ME LIKE A REAL FATHER.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.833
- THERE YOU GO.

19:12.833 --> 19:15.200
- GOOD. GOOD, GOOD. GO.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.567
- HEY, YOU THINK I LIKE
HAVING TO DO

19:17.567 --> 19:20.700
THE HOKEY-POKEY AROUND YOU
JUST TO GET SOME INFORMATION?

19:20.700 --> 19:22.767
I MEAN, IF--IF YOU
WEREN'T SUCH A BOY SCOUT,

19:22.767 --> 19:24.400
I COULD JUST COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY,

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
"RAY, WHO DO YOU LIKE
IN THE GAME TONIGHT?"

19:26.400 --> 19:31.567
AND THEN WE'D BET TOGETHER,
AND WE'D WIN TOGETHER.

19:31.567 --> 19:34.367
AND THEN WE'D GO
TO ONE OF THOSE RESTAURANTS

19:34.367 --> 19:36.200
WHERE THE GIRLS HAVE
THE TIGHT TOPS

19:36.200 --> 19:40.800
AND BRING YOU THE BIG BURGERS.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.467
THAT'S THE REAL
FATHER-AND-SON STUFF.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.367
- THAT'S REAL NICE, DAD,

19:48.367 --> 19:50.667
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I DO
FOR A LIVING.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.633
YOU KNOW I COULD NEVER
BET WITH YOU.

19:53.633 --> 19:55.567
- HENCE THE RUSE.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.300
AHH...

20:10.433 --> 20:12.467
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE OUT OF LINE

20:12.467 --> 20:15.600
IF YOU THINK
THAT I WAS FAKING

20:15.600 --> 20:19.567
TH-THE PART
ABOUT ENJOYING...

20:19.567 --> 20:23.000
WHATEVER, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND ME...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.267
A-AND, UH...

20:25.267 --> 20:28.267
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE BETTING STUFF,

20:28.267 --> 20:29.600
I WON'T DO IT ANYMORE.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.033
OKAY?

20:43.233 --> 20:45.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
