02:16.133 --> 02:22.758
ZERO FUCKS GIVEN

08:06.633 --> 08:09.842
- You've got the mollies on you?
- I called the guy.

08:14.342 --> 08:15.758
Call him!

08:15.925 --> 08:17.300
Call him.

08:19.300 --> 08:24.092
I sent him a message.
He said he'd be here in an hour.

08:24.842 --> 08:26.217
An hour?

08:28.883 --> 08:30.300
It's Spain!

08:39.092 --> 08:40.717
Can you buy me a drink?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.883
But I'm full of love, you see!

09:20.092 --> 09:22.550
I want to cry, I want to be happy
and at the same time, I...

09:22.717 --> 09:24.217
Come on, it's the drug.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.592
I want a bit of everything...

09:31.508 --> 09:33.883
I wanted to tell you earlier...
when I told you...

09:34.050 --> 09:36.883
You and me... We can... Sorry.

09:37.050 --> 09:41.300
- I said it like that...
- I'd prefer a "Let's go home together"

09:41.467 --> 09:43.258
than a "I'm looking for love".

09:45.717 --> 09:47.342
But I am really looking for it!

09:47.508 --> 09:48.508
- No!
- Yes!

09:48.675 --> 09:51.467
You're looking for it...
like looking for your phone...

09:52.467 --> 09:55.050
- It stresses me out!
- I just want to... you know...

09:55.217 --> 09:58.092
It's the drug, Arthur! The drug!

10:11.842 --> 10:14.925
Move your... your big sticky feet!

10:31.675 --> 10:33.717
If I throw up,
it'll be like a stream.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.925
Get your hand off.

10:36.633 --> 10:37.633
It's fine!

10:38.258 --> 10:39.675
Make me some noodles.

10:40.383 --> 10:43.008
- Make you some "poodles"?
- Noodles with ketchup and cheese.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.758
- I'm begging you...
- Ah, I thought you said "poodles".

10:45.925 --> 10:47.925
- Yeah, sure...
- No, it's OK.

10:48.092 --> 10:50.050
I'll make some...
noodles with ketchup?

10:50.217 --> 10:52.383
All right, let's go!

10:52.550 --> 10:56.300
You prefer to live with a Smarties...

10:56.800 --> 10:59.300
like, you're married for life...

10:59.467 --> 11:01.592
like, forever...

11:01.758 --> 11:03.883
and every time you say
"I'm in a relationship",

11:04.050 --> 11:05.217
he pops up.

11:06.258 --> 11:08.133
Or, or...

11:08.508 --> 11:10.300
Or, instead...

11:11.800 --> 11:13.508
When you...

11:14.050 --> 11:17.758
You put your keys in the keyhole

11:17.925 --> 11:20.842
to lock and open your door at home...

11:22.383 --> 11:24.050
there is...

11:24.883 --> 11:25.925
acid...

11:26.758 --> 11:28.633
rain that falls...

11:29.342 --> 11:30.842
like 2 km from your home.

11:31.008 --> 11:33.383
- So it can fall on anyone.
- Acid rain.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.008
- Would you rather kill people?
- No!

11:37.175 --> 11:39.008
Maybe... well.

11:39.508 --> 11:40.550
I dunno.

11:41.383 --> 11:43.217
I'd go out with the Smarties.

11:43.383 --> 11:44.925
- Would you rather...
- Not bad.

11:45.092 --> 11:48.675
have rubber arms so you can't hug anyone
and everything is soft,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.883
like marshmallow arms.

11:51.050 --> 11:53.675
Or, would you rather have 19 nipples?

11:57.883 --> 12:00.467
I would rather have...

12:02.008 --> 12:04.467
- Nineteen nipples.
- Nineteen?

12:04.633 --> 12:07.633
But that means the first time
you're shirtless in front of a woman...

12:08.175 --> 12:09.800
- Shit...
- So do you announce it?

12:09.967 --> 12:10.967
Shit...

12:11.883 --> 12:13.633
It'll come out.

12:14.175 --> 12:17.008
- That'll come out? How?
- Well it's... It's vodka.

12:17.175 --> 12:19.175
I'd rather have 19 nipples

12:19.342 --> 12:21.217
because I can hide them.

12:21.383 --> 12:24.342
Like, I can put hair on them
or something.

12:24.508 --> 12:27.300
- It'd be nice to get a little...
- A little what?

12:27.467 --> 12:30.717
- To get 19 nipples fondled like...
- I'm going to throw up!

12:30.883 --> 12:32.175
like a guitar.

12:35.175 --> 12:37.967
My mother had to see a client
that my father had to see.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.758
So she took his car.

12:40.925 --> 12:42.633
- Yeah.
- And...

12:44.217 --> 12:47.883
So she took his car
to go to this meeting.

12:48.050 --> 12:51.508
But to get to this meeting,
she had to go through a roundabout.

12:51.675 --> 12:55.300
It's a roundabout
that's a bit out of our town,

12:56.508 --> 12:58.592
but she was used to going through it.

12:59.342 --> 13:00.508
And...

13:00.925 --> 13:03.800
on this roundabout,
there are some decorations.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.383
You see... little walls, propellers...

13:07.550 --> 13:09.467
which where a bit all over the place.

13:09.633 --> 13:10.717
And...

13:12.008 --> 13:15.592
when she drove in,
she crashed into the roundabout.

13:15.758 --> 13:19.133
So... she died on impact?
Just like that, instantly?

13:22.050 --> 13:25.342
When someone called me...
she was dead, so...

13:27.758 --> 13:28.883
I think so.

13:29.592 --> 13:31.633
For example, my mum...

13:32.758 --> 13:35.258
It's unbearable right now.

13:36.008 --> 13:41.883
To see her age, to know that...
there's a process that's started that...

13:43.300 --> 13:46.092
I'm going to have to witness
her decline.

13:46.258 --> 13:50.467
It's really the end of a...
It's human decadence.

13:50.633 --> 13:55.217
She is just very... hardcore with us.

13:56.342 --> 13:57.883
In...

13:58.883 --> 14:01.300
In simple phases...

14:02.050 --> 14:07.175
When she's just at the table,
she'd rub her hands together like this

14:07.342 --> 14:10.550
before eating,
looking at all of us like...

14:12.300 --> 14:14.092
It's frightening!

14:14.258 --> 14:19.383
I don't know... She's taking us
into her long-term depression.

14:19.550 --> 14:22.967
And... I love her very, very much.

14:23.758 --> 14:26.842
I mean, to see...

14:27.592 --> 14:30.758
let people live to be old...

14:30.925 --> 14:34.008
that you have to be there for that.

14:34.175 --> 14:38.342
I mean... There's no going back.
And instead of

14:39.050 --> 14:42.508
having to witness...
this downward spiral.

14:42.675 --> 14:45.758
Maybe it's better to just hit a wall.

16:35.508 --> 16:36.717
Suzanna?

16:37.883 --> 16:38.967
Sylvia?

19:46.425 --> 19:50.133
DEREK -
SEE PROFILE OR RESPOND

20:39.050 --> 20:41.133
And you think these are good conditions?

20:41.300 --> 20:43.175
I don't know.
I need to work so I work.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.425
You need to work, and it's a great job
but not in such conditions.

20:46.592 --> 20:50.383
- Look at how other companies are!
- Conditions... It's always the same.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.592
There are always imperfections.

20:52.758 --> 20:55.800
Do you know the working conditions
in other companies?

20:55.967 --> 20:59.550
If for example, if you're sick,
do you get paid?

20:59.717 --> 21:02.967
I don't know, I try not to be sick.
I watch out for myself.

21:03.425 --> 21:06.217
- I drink vodka.
- I think it's really time to act!

21:06.383 --> 21:09.467
And it's phenomenal that
this strike is going on all over Europe.

21:09.633 --> 21:12.008
- Where are you based?
- I don't know. In Lanzarote,

21:12.175 --> 21:14.800
but I don't really have time
to make the revolution.

21:18.008 --> 21:20.758
We're going to be late.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.592
Go and talk to your colleagues!

21:40.758 --> 21:43.342
Some of your colleagues in Lanzarote
are on strike too.

21:43.508 --> 21:46.633
Go and see them.
They'll explain it to you.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.675
I'm sure that if we don't do anything

21:49.842 --> 21:51.508
things will get worse.

21:51.675 --> 21:54.925
Yeah,
but I don't really believe in change...

21:55.592 --> 21:59.550
We're not the same age
so what we can sacrifice isn't the same.

21:59.717 --> 22:01.383
Don't believe in change? Meaning?

22:01.550 --> 22:04.008
It means I have a flight
and I'd like to take it.

22:04.175 --> 22:05.425
What about the future?

22:05.592 --> 22:07.675
I don't even know
if I'll be alive tomorrow,

22:07.842 --> 22:09.883
so I just want to get on my flight.

22:58.467 --> 22:59.550
Are you OK?

23:02.592 --> 23:05.300
Are you OK or not?
Why don't you respond?

23:06.758 --> 23:07.842
About what?

23:08.425 --> 23:11.133
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine and you?

24:52.717 --> 24:53.758
Shit...

28:48.717 --> 28:51.008
Hey, Dad asks
if you'll be back for Christmas.

28:51.175 --> 28:53.008
I don't know if you have plans or not.

28:53.175 --> 28:54.258
See you.

29:00.342 --> 29:03.508
No, I won't be here for Christmas
or New Year's.

29:04.717 --> 29:06.883
I'm working at the time.

29:07.383 --> 29:10.300
I couldn't postpone.
I tried everything but they said no.

29:30.425 --> 29:32.675
Couldn't you have at least tried
to get off?

29:32.842 --> 29:34.508
Well... It's fine.

29:40.133 --> 29:43.175
I just told you
I tried but it didn't work.

39:58.508 --> 39:59.758
Hello?

39:59.925 --> 40:03.092
Hello Mrs Wessels,
this is Sabrina from Orange.

40:03.550 --> 40:07.675
Could you spare me a moment
to talk about your phone consumption?

40:08.342 --> 40:10.758
I saw that
you were on a hummingbird plan

40:10.925 --> 40:15.175
and I see that your data consumption
was mainly abroad.

40:15.342 --> 40:18.258
So I wanted to suggest the cheetah plan

40:18.425 --> 40:22.467
which would allow you
to have unlimited downloads abroad.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.425
Would you be interested in that?

40:24.592 --> 40:29.217
What's the difference in cost
to the one I have now?

40:29.383 --> 40:32.050
That's a difference of
fourteen euros and ninety cents.

40:32.217 --> 40:34.133
And then you'll have unlimited data.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.758
Then you won't get blocked
when you use up your data.

40:36.925 --> 40:39.883
All right, I'll take it.
I'd like to change my plan.

40:40.050 --> 40:43.758
However, it has to be the account holder
who does the modification

40:43.925 --> 40:46.175
so I will ask you for some information.

40:46.342 --> 40:48.425
You are Sabine Wessels...

40:49.675 --> 40:51.258
No, it's my mother.

40:53.217 --> 40:57.883
OK, then your mother needs to go online
and make the necessary changes.

40:58.050 --> 41:02.717
She can either do so
from her mobile application or online.

41:02.883 --> 41:08.050
The procedure is simple, she clicks on
"Document" on the "Add New Document" tab

41:08.217 --> 41:13.300
and then she will be able to allow you
to make the change on her behalf.

41:13.467 --> 41:18.008
Then you can change the phone plan.
Would that be OK?

41:19.967 --> 41:21.508
No, that's complicated.

41:24.217 --> 41:27.550
Well, another solution
would be for your mother

41:27.717 --> 41:30.342
to call the customer service directly
herself.

41:30.508 --> 41:33.550
It's going to be really complicated
because she's dead.

41:35.467 --> 41:37.217
I... I understand.

41:38.592 --> 41:43.383
What we can do is resend you the code
so that you have access...

41:43.550 --> 41:48.008
Well, maybe the best thing would be...
to cancel the line.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.467
- All right. - And your name?

41:52.717 --> 41:54.342
Cassandre Wessels.

41:54.508 --> 41:58.758
What I can suggest at this point
is to cancel the subscription

41:58.925 --> 42:02.550
- so you can create a new one.
- All right.

42:05.217 --> 42:06.800
Very well.

42:06.967 --> 42:10.717
However,
the cancellation fee will cost 43 euros

42:10.883 --> 42:13.883
which you'll have to pay
in order to reopen a line in your name.

42:14.050 --> 42:16.925
- Will that be fine?
- All right.

42:17.092 --> 42:20.383
- Great. I'll let you do the modification.
- Thank you.

42:20.550 --> 42:23.550
- Thank you for being a valued customer.
- Goodbye.

49:32.383 --> 49:36.258
In fact, the plan is simple.
I've just finished a year at Wing.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.508
I'll be a cabin manager.

49:38.675 --> 49:41.425
After that, I'll try out for Emirates.

49:41.592 --> 49:43.967
- I get into Emirates...
- Emirates is tough.

49:44.133 --> 49:45.550
I get into Emirates,

49:45.717 --> 49:47.800
- spend 3-4 years in Dubai...
- OK, but...

49:47.967 --> 49:50.675
Yes, it's the perfect plan but...

49:51.508 --> 49:54.133
- How many languages can you speak?
- Four.

49:54.300 --> 49:57.633
That's why. It's impossible for me.
They'll never take me.

49:57.800 --> 50:00.883
- It's not as easy as that!
- So, you've already given up!

50:01.050 --> 50:04.550
- Well, no, but...
- You don't even apply. That's that.

50:05.175 --> 50:07.717
It's not that...

50:07.883 --> 50:09.633
- Do you want to or not?
- Of course I do!

50:09.800 --> 50:13.008
You don't think it's my dream
to be walking around Dubai with a tiger?

50:13.175 --> 50:16.175
- Well, if you want to...
- Or to have a dolphin in my jacuzzi?

50:16.342 --> 50:19.050
If you want to have a dolphin
and a tiger, then go for it!

50:19.217 --> 50:21.300
But you have to be more of everything!

50:21.467 --> 50:25.675
You have to be more beautiful,
more smiley, more chic, and classier.

50:26.175 --> 50:29.467
Everything is more complicated.
It's not Wing, you know!

50:29.633 --> 50:31.175
Compared to them, we're...

50:32.300 --> 50:34.883
- Great! You got your life on lock.
- We're yokels.

50:35.050 --> 50:38.633
That's nice! It's great being young!

50:38.800 --> 50:40.258
No, but I'll try...

50:40.925 --> 50:42.842
but I'm sure it won't work out.

50:43.717 --> 50:45.675
They're too...

50:45.842 --> 50:48.467
they're too strict on language skills,
I'm telling you!

50:48.633 --> 50:52.383
They have thousands of applications
of people speaking seven languages.

50:52.550 --> 50:56.717
I'll walk in and speak a little English
and... I will never pass.

50:56.883 --> 51:00.175
You want me to tell you what I think
it's all about?

51:00.342 --> 51:03.675
- It's not the language or whatever.
- It's hope.

51:03.842 --> 51:06.675
No, it's not hope!
Stop talking like a grandma!

51:06.842 --> 51:08.217
It's gallantry!

51:09.508 --> 51:11.050
That's worse!

51:11.217 --> 51:14.258
You talk like a grandma's grandma!

51:14.883 --> 51:16.550
So gallantry means energetic?

51:16.717 --> 51:21.383
Just fake it! Fake having confidence
and everyone thinks you're hot shit.

1:01:55.258 --> 1:01:57.008
Take off your jacket, please.

1:02:06.883 --> 1:02:08.508
Thank you. Goodbye.

1:02:33.133 --> 1:02:34.342
Thank you.

1:02:51.842 --> 1:02:55.758
Forget Emirates. In Dubai for a month now,
working for a private jet company.

1:02:55.925 --> 1:02:58.050
Send in your CV,
they're hiring like crazy!

1:08:56.508 --> 1:08:59.175
It's the same job
with more responsibilities...

1:08:59.342 --> 1:09:01.925
It's not the same thing.
I manage the people I work with.

1:09:02.092 --> 1:09:04.592
And before I was under people's orders.

1:09:04.758 --> 1:09:08.425
The job is what you do.
You bring coffees and whatnot.

1:09:09.383 --> 1:09:10.383
- OK?
- Fine.

1:09:10.425 --> 1:09:12.425
She's managing and making the decisions.

1:09:12.592 --> 1:09:15.175
And we're not just serving coffee.

1:09:18.467 --> 1:09:21.133
If it's only serving coffee,
I'd work at Starbucks, you see?

1:09:21.300 --> 1:09:24.717
That's not what I meant... For example,
how many cabin managers are there?

1:09:24.883 --> 1:09:27.883
We are in the air.
There's maybe 30,000 in the company.

1:09:28.050 --> 1:09:31.508
- And how many planes, for example?
- Damn it, I don't know!

1:09:31.675 --> 1:09:33.675
- Dad, you're pretending not to get it!
- No!

1:09:33.842 --> 1:09:35.217
- Yes, you are!
- It's...

1:09:36.175 --> 1:09:38.633
Dad, you're my boss
but we do the same job.

1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:41.675
- Well... No.
- He does it on purpose.

1:09:42.550 --> 1:09:44.967
It's not that...
Yes, I manage a bit more

1:09:45.133 --> 1:09:47.550
- but I have more experience.
- I'm cleaning up.

1:09:49.217 --> 1:09:50.508
Well, that's good!

1:09:55.925 --> 1:09:57.758
But you agree with me

1:09:57.925 --> 1:10:00.842
in the end you still do things
with more responsibilities, but...

1:10:01.008 --> 1:10:04.217
- the job is the same, no?
- No.

1:10:06.092 --> 1:10:08.217
- It's not that I don't get it.
- Yes, you do.

1:10:08.383 --> 1:10:12.133
Anyway, when you did...
You got in there,

1:10:12.300 --> 1:10:15.675
because you wanted to travel,
and that's good.

1:10:15.842 --> 1:10:17.633
So you should continue with it.

1:10:19.675 --> 1:10:21.675
No, I think it's good but...

1:10:21.842 --> 1:10:25.425
- Because you said it was a promotion.
- In reality it's a very simple...

1:10:25.592 --> 1:10:28.175
It's not a promotion
because it's based on a competition!

1:10:28.342 --> 1:10:31.967
For example, if there's a...
a passenger who gets furious

1:10:32.133 --> 1:10:34.217
it's you who has to decide
how to handle it.

1:10:34.383 --> 1:10:36.883
Yes, so do I call the police,
do I get him out,

1:10:37.050 --> 1:10:39.383
- if someone has a stroke...
- A stewardess can't.

1:10:39.550 --> 1:10:41.550
But the captain
has to take care of that.

1:10:41.717 --> 1:10:45.550
Yes, but I don't want to be the pilot
of the plane. I'm the boss of...

1:10:45.717 --> 1:10:47.133
the flight attendants.

1:10:47.300 --> 1:10:49.925
You are a stewardess.
A stewardess plus more.

1:10:50.092 --> 1:10:52.800
It's not "plus more",
it's chief attendant. Line manager?

1:10:52.967 --> 1:10:54.883
- Cabin manager!
- Cabin manager.

1:10:59.967 --> 1:11:02.675
I don't need that, Dad.

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:05.175
It's not just for you,
it's for the pillows too.

1:11:09.967 --> 1:11:13.050
If you gave me another day
I could have sorted it out

1:11:13.217 --> 1:11:14.842
but you didn't warn me...

1:11:20.008 --> 1:11:21.592
It's not that, it's that...

1:11:22.133 --> 1:11:26.675
Because I had to store away
all the agency's archives,

1:11:27.633 --> 1:11:31.633
they were in the garage,
and there's no room now with the pickup.

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:33.717
So I put them in your room.

1:11:34.758 --> 1:11:35.800
Pardon.

1:14:01.842 --> 1:14:03.092
What's up?

1:14:04.758 --> 1:14:05.800
Very well.

1:14:05.967 --> 1:14:09.383
... so it's 279,500 euros...

1:14:12.967 --> 1:14:15.425
Yes, it is 79,500, exactly.

1:14:16.342 --> 1:14:19.133
For the land registry,
I could give it to you at the visit

1:14:19.300 --> 1:14:21.883
but as it's a second visit
there won't be too many issues.

1:14:22.675 --> 1:14:24.008
Exactly.

1:14:24.175 --> 1:14:26.258
And this time,
you'll be with your husband.

1:14:27.550 --> 1:14:28.550
OK.

1:14:29.133 --> 1:14:30.967
So we'll say Wednesday

1:14:31.633 --> 1:14:33.050
at 2PM, and it'll be with me.

1:14:34.550 --> 1:14:36.758
I bought it second hand

1:14:36.925 --> 1:14:40.300
from a friend of mine
who wanted to get a new car.

1:14:41.383 --> 1:14:43.508
It's a Mercedes, so it's solid.

1:14:43.675 --> 1:14:45.508
And parking isn't a problem?

1:14:47.342 --> 1:14:49.175
That's not why I got it.

1:14:49.342 --> 1:14:52.008
I got it because it's indestructible.

1:14:52.175 --> 1:14:54.550
If you drive into a tree,
the tree falls over.

1:14:56.758 --> 1:14:59.508
And...
it's a question of social standing.

1:14:59.675 --> 1:15:02.883
When the customers see you arrive,
you stand out differently.

1:15:04.467 --> 1:15:06.675
- Well, it's true.
- That's funny.

1:15:06.842 --> 1:15:09.592
Well, we are in a business of image.

1:15:09.758 --> 1:15:12.258
And you dress like that
when you see clients?

1:15:12.425 --> 1:15:14.175
I'm a bit more relaxed now.

1:15:15.717 --> 1:15:18.508
Some clients in the countryside like it
when I dress like this.

1:15:18.675 --> 1:15:20.550
I know I have to adapt to the client.

1:15:21.092 --> 1:15:22.258
And...

1:15:24.342 --> 1:15:27.467
When farmers see me in my leather jacket
they trust me straight away.

1:15:27.633 --> 1:15:31.758
If I show up with my suit,
they don't trust me.

1:15:31.925 --> 1:15:35.925
But when we have to deal with
real estate operations, it's a suit.

1:15:36.717 --> 1:15:38.050
That's what sales is,

1:15:38.217 --> 1:15:40.842
knowing who you're dealing with
to reassure them.

1:15:42.300 --> 1:15:44.300
And the pickup plays a part in this.

1:15:44.842 --> 1:15:47.508
When I arrive, they say,
"Wow, it works!" It reassures them.

1:15:47.675 --> 1:15:50.508
The pickup is reassuring.
It's impressive!

1:15:51.133 --> 1:15:53.717
It may not be easy to park

1:15:53.883 --> 1:15:55.092
but...

1:16:02.842 --> 1:16:06.883
I like being higher. You can see
the road better and you're above others.

1:16:26.592 --> 1:16:28.092
What are you doing?

1:16:28.633 --> 1:16:29.758
Why are you here?

1:16:31.925 --> 1:16:33.008
Are you OK?

1:16:33.175 --> 1:16:34.967
- Weren't you sleeping?
- No.

1:16:36.758 --> 1:16:38.842
Do you want some herbal tea?

1:16:57.717 --> 1:16:59.342
What are you checking?

1:17:01.342 --> 1:17:05.008
When I get up,
I check that the door is closed.

1:17:18.550 --> 1:17:21.258
- Do you often get up at night?
- No, it's just that...

1:17:22.967 --> 1:17:25.175
I'm used to getting up early for work.

1:17:30.008 --> 1:17:32.383
I'm ready by 4 AM in the morning.

1:17:34.592 --> 1:17:36.342
That's what I usually do.

1:17:48.133 --> 1:17:49.342
What time is it?

1:17:50.675 --> 1:17:51.925
It's 4:20.

1:17:58.550 --> 1:18:00.717
So where are we going afterwards?

1:18:00.883 --> 1:18:02.550
We're going to Moulin de Solières!

1:18:02.717 --> 1:18:05.758
- Moulin de Solières still exists?
- Of course!

1:18:05.925 --> 1:18:09.217
- Wow!
- The old bearded bouncer's still there.

1:18:09.967 --> 1:18:11.842
- Gandalf!
- Gandalf!

1:18:12.008 --> 1:18:14.842
You put your feet in and it gets hot.

1:18:15.008 --> 1:18:16.550
- I swear!
- Seriously?

1:18:16.717 --> 1:18:19.842
I brought these for you girls,
but I'll let you choose the smells.

1:18:20.008 --> 1:18:23.133
I saw some real French shops
so I thought of you girls.

1:18:23.300 --> 1:18:27.383
- What's this?
- Many different body creams and stuff.

1:18:28.717 --> 1:18:30.508
- That's so nice!
- No worries!

1:18:30.675 --> 1:18:33.300
- These are samples?
- No, they're mini bottles,

1:18:33.467 --> 1:18:35.592
but they do look like a spray for a day.

1:18:35.758 --> 1:18:37.217
- So yeah...
- So nice!

1:18:37.383 --> 1:18:41.050
It's never really too hot
like in Marrakech.

1:18:41.217 --> 1:18:44.092
Yeah, it's true it's windier
than in Marrakech.

1:18:45.342 --> 1:18:48.842
That's so cool! You must have seen
some beautiful places!

1:18:49.008 --> 1:18:51.133
Yeah, I'm lucky.
I've been all over Europe.

1:18:51.300 --> 1:18:54.258
And a bit of Africa too!

1:18:55.883 --> 1:18:57.717
Were you able to get around?

1:18:57.883 --> 1:19:01.550
- And have you seen all the countries?
- I didn't always have time to visit.

1:19:01.717 --> 1:19:06.967
A fortnight ago, in the same week,
I went to Milan, Mykonos, Essaouira...

1:19:07.925 --> 1:19:10.717
- and then we went back to Lanzarote.
- Not bad.

1:19:10.883 --> 1:19:14.092
- What? You don't want to do that?
- Yeah, tomorrow...

1:19:14.258 --> 1:19:16.800
- And we do it well...
- Yes, but my sister is right there!

1:19:17.300 --> 1:19:19.925
- It's fine.
- What do you mean?

1:19:20.508 --> 1:19:23.217
Cassandre!
I already had sex with your sister.

1:19:26.050 --> 1:19:27.383
You annoy me!

1:19:27.550 --> 1:19:29.717
You talking like this
stresses out my dad.

1:19:29.883 --> 1:19:31.217
Come on, your dad loves me!

1:19:31.383 --> 1:19:34.758
He's my friend and she even knows it!

1:19:34.925 --> 1:19:38.842
- It's only right now.
- Stop putting on your show!

1:19:39.008 --> 1:19:41.383
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1:19:41.967 --> 1:19:43.508
Don't worry about it...

1:19:44.508 --> 1:19:47.217
You're better behaved
when you're in front of Jean.

1:19:47.383 --> 1:19:48.800
- He scares me!
- Really?

1:19:48.967 --> 1:19:51.050
- Yeah, he's so...
- But our dad is a softy!

1:19:51.217 --> 1:19:52.717
Really?

1:19:52.883 --> 1:19:54.967
- I don't know, he seems a bit strict!
- No!

1:19:55.467 --> 1:19:59.217
No, he can come off a bit...
He's actually quite shy.

1:19:59.383 --> 1:20:02.717
- We were never spanked!
- Yes, you were! You don't remember...

1:20:02.883 --> 1:20:04.758
I remember...

1:20:04.925 --> 1:20:08.800
Even I've been spanked
by your father too!

1:20:08.967 --> 1:20:11.967
It should be called a dish:
"Jean's spankings".

1:20:12.842 --> 1:20:16.258
- Don't you want to settle down sometimes?
- Yeah, but every day is different,

1:20:16.425 --> 1:20:19.175
I never get bored and I meet
different people all the time.

1:20:19.342 --> 1:20:22.175
In the same day, I can see snow and sun.
I'm rather lucky!

1:20:22.342 --> 1:20:24.258
So you're not attached to anyone?

1:20:25.675 --> 1:20:26.883
No, nobody.

1:20:27.050 --> 1:20:29.175
- Really not?
- Nope.

1:20:29.342 --> 1:20:32.050
Why are you travelling
if you don't meet anyone?

1:20:32.217 --> 1:20:34.925
I meet people and I have flatmates
but I have to accept

1:20:35.092 --> 1:20:37.717
that I like them for two hours
and then it's goodbye.

1:20:37.883 --> 1:20:40.383
What's wrong with you?
You look like you have...

1:20:41.092 --> 1:20:44.258
- You can't talk about attachment!
- Ah, we're still on this!

1:20:44.425 --> 1:20:46.717
- Yes, we are!
- Yes, Cassandre!

1:20:47.092 --> 1:20:48.425
Oh my God!

1:20:51.425 --> 1:20:55.217
I don't understand.
What is the definition of attachment?

1:20:56.008 --> 1:21:00.425
It's the moment when you're entitled
to make mistakes, come back, and argue.

1:21:00.592 --> 1:21:02.717
- If you meet someone for two hours...
- Yeah!

1:21:02.883 --> 1:21:05.967
I'm entitled to it all!
We don't even know who we are!

1:21:06.592 --> 1:21:07.800
Melissa?

1:21:07.967 --> 1:21:09.883
Melissa, do you have a cigarette?

1:21:10.050 --> 1:21:11.675
I only have rolled cigarettes.

1:21:12.342 --> 1:21:16.217
- We only smoke rolled cigarettes here!
- Do you guys have a cigarette?

1:21:17.133 --> 1:21:20.925
- Vincent? Vincent?
- Does anyone have a cigarette?

1:21:22.092 --> 1:21:24.967
Don't you have a real cigarette?
An industrial one?

1:21:26.633 --> 1:21:28.842
I'll roll one up for you.

1:21:33.842 --> 1:21:36.050
Are you OK, sir?
Would you like some change?

1:21:38.342 --> 1:21:39.675
Sir!

1:21:43.425 --> 1:21:44.717
He's scared of you!

1:21:44.883 --> 1:21:46.925
Would you like some change, sir?

1:21:47.092 --> 1:21:49.092
- You are very scary.
- You're very scary!

1:21:49.258 --> 1:21:51.258
- We saw a shadow!
- Don't stand in the dark!

1:21:51.425 --> 1:21:53.925
- You said Alessandro and now it's Aless.
- But you...

1:21:54.092 --> 1:21:56.508
No, it's OK, it's OK!

1:21:56.925 --> 1:21:59.508
- Do you like him?
- Yeah. Do you like him too?

1:21:59.675 --> 1:22:01.550
- I do!
- Well that's that.

1:22:02.842 --> 1:22:04.883
He'll take us back.

1:22:18.925 --> 1:22:20.133
Slow down!

1:22:48.633 --> 1:22:51.050
What the hell!
She puked all over the seat!

1:22:52.925 --> 1:22:54.425
Give me her bag!

1:22:54.592 --> 1:22:56.383
Damn it, Melissa! You piss me off!

1:22:57.633 --> 1:22:59.592
Every weekend
it's the same damn thing!

1:23:04.592 --> 1:23:06.383
Here's her bag!

1:23:06.550 --> 1:23:08.300
You fucking asshole!

1:23:08.467 --> 1:23:09.800
Shut the fuck up!

1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:41.300
Are you OK?

1:25:04.758 --> 1:25:06.300
Is this for trash?

1:25:06.467 --> 1:25:08.300
- That's for trash.
- Hold on.

1:25:09.592 --> 1:25:11.758
You can throw that away... 2010.

1:25:13.675 --> 1:25:15.883
That's disgusting stuff!

1:25:17.217 --> 1:25:20.758
They were at your grandmother's
and we've been carrying them for years.

1:25:23.342 --> 1:25:25.383
- It was fashionable back then!
- But why?

1:25:25.550 --> 1:25:28.425
- It was for decoration.
- Are we throwing it away?

1:25:29.383 --> 1:25:31.342
- No, I've always had it.
- You use it

1:25:31.508 --> 1:25:33.883
if you don't want to be seen
when you go next door.

1:25:37.383 --> 1:25:40.383
That... that's not possible...

1:25:42.550 --> 1:25:45.217
Another box of 2004 documents.

1:25:45.383 --> 1:25:48.592
2004 is to be thrown out.
We don't need anything before 2010.

1:25:48.758 --> 1:25:50.717
We have to keep these for ten years.

1:25:50.883 --> 1:25:53.092
- Why?
- It's the law.

1:25:54.008 --> 1:25:57.633
- We can throw that out too. It's 2002.
- OK, wow... Hold on.

1:26:04.092 --> 1:26:06.467
I'll take it out later.
We're almost done.

1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:10.425
- Account 2016, so it's thrown out.
- No, we're keeping it.

1:26:10.592 --> 1:26:12.008
Just kidding!

1:26:12.175 --> 1:26:14.467
OK, you're listening.
We forgot that!

1:26:15.217 --> 1:26:16.967
What do we do with this?

1:26:20.675 --> 1:26:22.342
We'll put them in the cellar...

1:26:24.300 --> 1:26:25.383
The basement.

1:26:26.550 --> 1:26:28.258
Don't you want to throw them out?

1:26:29.467 --> 1:26:30.300
No.

1:26:30.467 --> 1:26:32.092
We'll put them in the basement.

1:27:13.050 --> 1:27:14.675
- Hey.
- How are you?

1:27:14.842 --> 1:27:16.175
Yes...

1:27:18.550 --> 1:27:22.133
- Isn't Dad with you?
- No, he's eating with his lawyer.

1:27:22.300 --> 1:27:23.592
What for?

1:27:27.092 --> 1:27:29.300
For yet another appeal.

1:27:33.717 --> 1:27:35.467
It will never fucking end!

1:27:35.633 --> 1:27:37.217
Is there anything new?

1:27:37.383 --> 1:27:40.925
Well... no. He's apparently still at it.

1:27:41.092 --> 1:27:42.758
I don't get why he does this.

1:27:52.050 --> 1:27:53.592
Three appeals didn't work.

1:27:54.175 --> 1:27:56.133
His lawyer doesn't charge him anymore.

1:27:56.300 --> 1:27:58.133
He invites him to the restaurant!

1:28:03.467 --> 1:28:05.800
Why doesn't he get a second appraisal?

1:28:07.258 --> 1:28:11.133
Because she was the one speeding,
even if it wasn't much. So...

1:28:11.717 --> 1:28:14.550
The speed limit is fifty
and she was doing fifty-seven.

1:28:16.883 --> 1:28:18.258
What were you thinking?

1:28:19.675 --> 1:28:22.008
That she was doing
between seventy to eighty.

1:34:01.300 --> 1:34:03.508
Is it the same area all the way through
or is it...

1:34:03.675 --> 1:34:06.008
- Is it wider here?
- Yes, it's wider here.

1:34:11.550 --> 1:34:13.925
We're thinking
of placing the kitchen here...

1:34:14.092 --> 1:34:17.717
What's very fashionable at the moment
are island kitchens...

1:34:17.883 --> 1:34:21.883
It's very welcoming, for drinks
and doing homework with the children...

1:34:25.008 --> 1:34:28.675
... a play area there
and the more parental area here...

1:34:30.175 --> 1:34:32.258
- I'll let you look around?
- OK.

1:35:01.008 --> 1:35:02.675
Can I have a sip of your beer?

1:35:10.925 --> 1:35:12.467
Who bought that gnome?

1:35:13.842 --> 1:35:15.092
You know who.

1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:20.008
I forgot.

1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:28.425
Your mother liked tall men
but she also liked garden gnomes.

1:35:32.008 --> 1:35:33.925
She was full of contradictions.

1:35:37.425 --> 1:35:39.925
Before you,
was she with someone tall or short?

1:35:40.633 --> 1:35:42.800
Before me, she wasn't with anyone.

1:35:42.967 --> 1:35:44.550
That's what you think!

1:35:45.675 --> 1:35:47.217
She had no one before you?

1:35:47.383 --> 1:35:49.425
I didn't say she didn't have anyone.

1:35:49.592 --> 1:35:51.175
I said she wasn't with anyone.

1:35:51.925 --> 1:35:53.217
But do you really know?

1:35:53.383 --> 1:35:55.258
- That she wasn't with anyone?
- Yeah.

1:35:55.967 --> 1:35:58.967
Getting the light on
used to be my favourite game.

1:36:00.217 --> 1:36:01.675
Sure, cheerleaders...

1:36:07.925 --> 1:36:09.383
Papa Beaver.

1:36:10.175 --> 1:36:12.758
Tell us a story, Papa Beaver.

1:36:16.217 --> 1:36:17.758
No really, don't you know?

1:36:19.342 --> 1:36:21.092
No. When I appeared...

1:36:21.925 --> 1:36:24.258
she was very young and so was I, and...

1:36:25.050 --> 1:36:26.758
we met over there.

1:36:27.508 --> 1:36:30.008
- Not far from here.
- How did you pick her up?

1:36:31.883 --> 1:36:34.467
- Tell us all the details.
- No...

1:36:34.633 --> 1:36:37.217
- Please!
- No, that's our story.

1:36:37.383 --> 1:36:38.967
But it's ours too!

1:36:41.758 --> 1:36:43.550
What did you tell her? And how?

1:36:44.425 --> 1:36:47.383
To know the whole story, I think it's...

1:36:47.550 --> 1:36:50.717
I think she was hitting on me
but she always said the opposite.

1:36:51.175 --> 1:36:53.050
But I think she was pushing it a bit.

1:36:53.633 --> 1:36:54.883
Did she dance well?

1:36:55.842 --> 1:36:57.133
She danced very well.

1:36:58.342 --> 1:37:00.342
I liked that best,
among other things.

1:37:01.508 --> 1:37:03.592
- Can you imitate her?
- And she was always...

1:37:04.092 --> 1:37:05.467
No, I couldn't do that!

1:37:06.342 --> 1:37:07.800
So, how did you dance?

1:37:09.217 --> 1:37:11.800
Back in those days, it was minimal.

1:37:17.258 --> 1:37:18.842
Did you ask her to dance?

1:37:20.258 --> 1:37:23.467
We weren't at the ball, you know!

1:37:24.008 --> 1:37:26.758
There were rock stages and concerts.

1:37:26.925 --> 1:37:29.883
We weren't inviting each other.
We weren't at the ball.

1:37:30.508 --> 1:37:32.008
When was the first kiss?

1:37:33.508 --> 1:37:35.092
The first time we kissed?

1:37:36.300 --> 1:37:38.633
Well, it was after a concert

1:37:39.383 --> 1:37:41.800
and we were pretty drunk...

1:37:44.717 --> 1:37:45.925
and...

1:37:46.717 --> 1:37:50.800
I think it helped me
overcome my shyness

1:37:51.300 --> 1:37:52.842
and not to overthink it.

1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:56.258
She seemed to agree.

1:37:56.425 --> 1:37:58.633
The proof is that
you arrived not long after.

1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:00.383
So there was something.

1:38:00.550 --> 1:38:01.967
For once I figured it out.

1:38:05.133 --> 1:38:07.550
- Were you there for both births?
- Of course.

1:38:11.592 --> 1:38:13.258
The first one was "whoa".

1:38:14.717 --> 1:38:16.550
- Why?
- Because it was...

1:38:17.383 --> 1:38:19.300
I was very young and so was she.

1:38:20.008 --> 1:38:21.300
We didn't know

1:38:21.467 --> 1:38:24.092
and then suddenly it was real.

1:38:25.092 --> 1:38:26.800
You were very small...

1:38:27.633 --> 1:38:30.342
like a real, small animal.

1:38:32.842 --> 1:38:34.383
Thirty centimetres long...

1:38:36.925 --> 1:38:38.967
I can't remember...

1:38:39.133 --> 1:38:41.050
I remember the weight
but not the size.

1:38:42.467 --> 1:38:43.717
It was 3.5 kg.

1:38:44.425 --> 1:38:46.425
I don't know the size.
I can't remember.

1:38:47.217 --> 1:38:50.383
But then it was real,
and we looked at each other like,

1:38:51.008 --> 1:38:52.008
"That's it!"

1:38:53.342 --> 1:38:55.467
- What do you mean?
- That you were there.

1:38:55.633 --> 1:38:57.633
We switched to something else.

1:38:59.258 --> 1:39:01.675
Then everything went very quickly...

1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:04.092
Everything changed.

1:39:04.967 --> 1:39:06.925
Your delivery too, it was...

1:39:07.425 --> 1:39:09.508
for other reasons, it was very strong.

1:39:13.092 --> 1:39:16.258
Your mother had a problem
at the last moment

1:39:16.425 --> 1:39:18.050
and you couldn't come out.

1:39:18.550 --> 1:39:22.842
The epidural wasn't working.
So they decided to open...

1:39:23.342 --> 1:39:24.800
to do a caesarean...

1:39:27.967 --> 1:39:29.342
And so...

1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:33.383
I had to take you and have skin contact,
you know?

1:39:35.008 --> 1:39:39.717
When the baby arrives,
they put it on the mother's breast...

1:39:41.175 --> 1:39:43.550
to warm the baby up...
but as she had a caesarean.

1:39:43.717 --> 1:39:45.925
I took you on me

1:39:46.092 --> 1:39:48.050
to warm you up, to calm you down,

1:39:48.217 --> 1:39:51.592
to comfort you, and you were
a little animal looking for the breast.

1:39:52.842 --> 1:39:54.342
Sorry, I didn't have any.

1:39:56.342 --> 1:39:58.550
It's a reflex the baby has
when it comes out.

1:39:58.717 --> 1:40:01.550
It's a survival thing.
It climbs up to reach the breast.

1:40:02.883 --> 1:40:04.133
A little animal.

1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:11.008
So...

1:40:11.883 --> 1:40:14.217
When reported,
the vehicle was found embedded

1:40:14.383 --> 1:40:16.550
on the pile of rocks in the roundabout.

1:40:16.717 --> 1:40:19.300
The vehicle is on its side
at a 45 degree angle,

1:40:19.467 --> 1:40:22.050
approximately 7.5 metres from the road.

1:40:22.217 --> 1:40:26.300
The driver, Mrs Sabine Wessels,
fifty-three years old, is deceased.

1:40:30.508 --> 1:40:33.258
I'm sorry.
We can take a little break if you want.

1:40:34.133 --> 1:40:37.842
I'm obliged to read it.
It's the law in fact. I have no choice.

1:40:38.008 --> 1:40:40.092
- It's not pleasant for me either.
- Let's go on.

1:40:40.467 --> 1:40:44.508
The front end, passenger compartment
and the engine crashed into the rocks

1:40:44.675 --> 1:40:46.717
in the landscaping.

1:40:46.883 --> 1:40:48.717
The left fender was crushed,

1:40:48.883 --> 1:40:52.925
part of the vehicle was on fire,
and the right rear tyre was burst.

1:40:53.092 --> 1:40:55.967
A large amount of rubber residue
was found on the road surface

1:40:56.133 --> 1:40:58.633
at an angle
of approximately 125 degrees,

1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:03.050
suggesting that the vehicle had veered
violently onto the far-right lane.

1:41:03.508 --> 1:41:07.925
When reported, the roundabout
was partially covered with gravel.

1:41:08.092 --> 1:41:12.800
This may be due to a construction site
on the road leading to Floreffe.

1:41:12.967 --> 1:41:16.592
Yet, we cannot certify that this was
the direct cause of the tyre blow-out

1:41:16.758 --> 1:41:19.550
that caused the vehicle
to deviate from its course.

1:41:20.550 --> 1:41:23.383
After that, there are still
two or three Volkswagen

1:41:23.550 --> 1:41:24.967
and then it's Peugeots.

1:41:26.925 --> 1:41:29.383
Because those are all Fiats.

1:41:30.508 --> 1:41:33.217
But it's not possible...

1:42:34.092 --> 1:42:35.258
Here it is.

1:42:35.842 --> 1:42:39.592
This is the document for the court
to say that the vehicle was not present.

1:42:40.425 --> 1:42:42.633
So the assessment could not take place.

1:42:43.383 --> 1:42:45.508
This will be the other copy for me...

1:42:48.300 --> 1:42:49.300
Forward...

1:42:49.425 --> 1:42:53.217
How long will it take for the court
to process a...

1:42:53.383 --> 1:42:55.633
to set a new date
for a new expert opinion?

1:42:56.800 --> 1:42:58.550
Well...

1:42:59.008 --> 1:43:02.717
If there's no vehicle, I won't be able
to carry out the assessment.

1:43:02.883 --> 1:43:05.383
- Well, that's...
- Not you, but...

1:43:06.342 --> 1:43:10.258
I don't know... that there is a new file
and a new assessment?

1:43:10.425 --> 1:43:14.133
Then we'll have to close the case
and slowly move on to compensation...

1:43:14.300 --> 1:43:16.467
especially if there is no more vehicle.

1:43:43.842 --> 1:43:46.508
I don't even know how to drink that.
I forgot.

1:43:46.675 --> 1:43:49.133
- What is it, a shot?
- No.

1:43:49.550 --> 1:43:52.758
Not everything is a shot, Cassandre.

1:43:54.300 --> 1:43:55.842
It smells like solvent.

1:43:57.717 --> 1:44:00.342
I'm sure when you drink shots,
you get a little tear.

1:44:00.925 --> 1:44:03.508
Isn't that true?
You have the little...

1:44:07.175 --> 1:44:09.175
I'm drinking it for you, Dad.

1:44:17.883 --> 1:44:19.217
You've got fags?

1:44:19.383 --> 1:44:20.883
- Do you want a fag?
- Yes.

1:44:21.050 --> 1:44:22.758
- A fag.
- I haven't got one on me.

1:44:22.925 --> 1:44:24.842
- Do you have any?
- For you?

1:44:25.508 --> 1:44:26.508
Well, what?

1:44:27.508 --> 1:44:29.008
In my bag in the hall.

1:45:33.175 --> 1:45:34.925
You shouldn't blame yourself.

1:45:38.717 --> 1:45:41.383
- Not even a little?
- No.

1:45:44.592 --> 1:45:47.758
I was angry with you when you left
and didn't warn us in advance.

1:45:49.258 --> 1:45:51.050
Actually, I didn't know what to say.

1:45:52.508 --> 1:45:55.383
I didn't know
if I was going to come home or not.

1:45:55.550 --> 1:45:57.050
I didn't know what to say.

1:46:11.008 --> 1:46:12.175
I'm sorry.

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.000
