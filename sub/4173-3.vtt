10:18.409 --> 10:19.661
I mean,
you are so busted!

10:19.661 --> 10:21.788
But thank you!

10:21.788 --> 10:24.374
Took a few tries there.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.792
If I were thinking, I would've
just pushed this "fly" button!

10:28.545 --> 10:30.421
Oh, it's that kind of fly.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.427
Whoa! That is so weird!

10:36.427 --> 10:38.638
We're in a space shuttle and the
shuttle program ended years ago!

10:39.889 --> 10:41.766
I guess that's it.
Fun's over.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.309
<i>Au contra ire.</i>

10:46.646 --> 10:48.898
Sorbet?

10:48.898 --> 10:52.652
This is great! It's the
best inator I've ever made!

10:52.652 --> 10:54.529
And you know what,
Perry the Platypus?

10:54.529 --> 10:57.323
There's no self-destruct
button on this,

10:57.323 --> 10:58.825
so there's no way
you can stop me from

10:58.825 --> 11:01.452
taking over the entire Tri-State.
. . (OBJECT FALLING)

11:03.830 --> 11:05.415
Ha.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.834
Well, like my
Uncle Boris used to say,

11:07.834 --> 11:12.839
when life's going well, a giant tire
comes along and smashes your inator.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.591
We all thought
he was crazy at the time,

11:14.591 --> 11:16.801
but now he seems
rather prophetic.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.845
I don't get why this
stuff is called sorbet.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.847
Ain't it just the fancy
people word for ice cream?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.849
Where ice cream is
made from dairy products

11:22.849 --> 11:24.559
and turned
vigorously with air,

11:24.559 --> 11:26.728
sorbet is made entirely
out of fancy people.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.479
Really?
No, not really.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.440
Hey, guys.
ls Candace around?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.358
(IMITATI NG SOUTH ERN ACCENT) Hey
there, Jeremy. A little bird told me

11:32.358 --> 11:34.694
we were going to the rodeo.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.614
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Actually,
sir, it is pronounced Ro-day-o.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.365
Oh, yeah.
My mistake.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.869
May I take your
order, partner?

11:42.869 --> 11:46.497
(SIGHS) I don't suppose it's "dress like a
cowboy and get your dinner free" night?

11:46.497 --> 11:50.210
No, madam.
That is Tuesdays.
