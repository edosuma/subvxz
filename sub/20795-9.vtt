- Nada.

29:33.417 --> 29:35.166
You're as straight
as the Tin Man's dick,

29:35.166 --> 29:36.083
as far as anyone's concerned.

29:38.291 --> 29:39.583
Can you do me a favor?

29:39.583 --> 29:41.792
God knows I owe you one.

29:41.792 --> 29:43.792
I know you're going
through a lot of shit,

29:43.792 --> 29:45.417
getting cleaned up, girlfriend,

29:45.417 --> 29:48.542

a little bit more

29:48.542 --> 29:51.625

in front of me.

29:51.625 --> 29:54.041
Can you manage that?

29:57.166 --> 29:59.250
You got it, Chief.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.417
It's bad enough
we have to touch asses,

30:26.417 --> 30:29.041

it's too much.

30:30.917 --> 30:31.542

30:36.291 --> 30:39.125
They're probably dealing with
more important things

30:39.125 --> 30:39.959
than your two-line part.

30:39.959 --> 30:41.875
They'll probably call you
tomorrow.

30:41.875 --> 30:44.500
Yeah, most likely
to say "no, thanks"

30:44.500 --> 30:46.291

30:46.291 --> 30:47.166

- You.

30:47.166 --> 30:50.000

to your goo-goo universe talk.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.542
Yeah, right, like there's not
part of you that'll be happy

31:02.542 --> 31:05.417

31:08.000 --> 31:09.667

aren't even touching.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.875
It's just

it's like a magnet
sucking all the positive energy

31:14.333 --> 31:15.458

31:15.458 --> 31:18.667

31:18.667 --> 31:20.917
did you ever think
that if you don't get the job,

31:20.917 --> 31:24.375
it's because you didn't do
anything to earn it?

31:24.375 --> 31:27.917
You didn't manifest anything
with your positive bullshit.

31:27.917 --> 31:31.041
You got lucky.
You got an audition.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.542
And now if it doesn't go
your way,

31:32.542 --> 31:33.709

you not getting the part?

31:35.959 --> 31:37.875
If you don't get the part,
