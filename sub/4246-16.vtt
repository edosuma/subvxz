- "Mr. President." I'll never get
over saying that. - Jake.

00:04.113 --> 00:05.313
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:05.380 --> 00:06.080
How is she?

00:06.181 --> 00:08.147
She's good. Quiet.
Makes my job easy.

00:08.215 --> 00:09.749
She seems harmless.

00:09.817 --> 00:11.951
Olivia Pope
is not what she seems.

00:12.018 --> 00:13.720
Stay on her.

00:13.787 --> 00:15.287
- Yes.
- Yes?

00:15.356 --> 00:17.490
Yes, I will go out with you.

00:17.558 --> 00:19.091
(Fitz) They're running
a damn dally

00:19.159 --> 00:21.293
of the most glaring failure
of my presidency,

00:21.362 --> 00:23.295
while we for all apparent
purposes do nothing.

00:23.364 --> 00:25.297
You are doing everything
to get those hostages back safe.

00:25.365 --> 00:26.631
It's not your fault

00:26.699 --> 00:27.967
the intelligence
simply isn't there.

00:28.034 --> 00:29.701
These are the hostages.

00:29.769 --> 00:31.536
Their C.I.A. files were on
Wendy's flash drive.

00:31.604 --> 00:33.939
So Albatross, the mole,
the man who killed Wendy...

00:34.007 --> 00:36.141
He's the one who leaked
their names to the terrorists.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.477
That's him. That's the guy
who wanted what Wendy stole!

00:38.544 --> 00:40.411
That's the guy who killed her!
That's him on the tv!

00:40.479 --> 00:42.413
That is him!

00:42.481 --> 00:44.515
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

00:44.583 --> 00:46.885
- Mom, I'm starving.
- I think daddy ordered some pizza.

00:46.952 --> 00:48.920
- Ham and pineapple?
- Phil, the wireless is down again.

00:48.988 --> 00:51.022
Yeah, it's been acting funny
all night.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.091
- Emmett, set the table, would you?
- Dad, ham and pineapple?

00:53.158 --> 00:55.326
I have to look at this proposal
before the west coast goes down.

00:55.394 --> 00:57.327
-Try turning it off and turning it on.
- Dad?

00:57.395 --> 00:58.728
- What?
- What'd you get on the pizza?

00:58.796 --> 01:00.297
Ham and pineapple's gross.

01:00.365 --> 01:02.065
It's Hawaiian. Insult
their culture, why don't you?

01:02.133 --> 01:03.767
Hey. I got pepperoni.
Everybody's happy.

01:03.834 --> 01:04.968
- Ew.
- Gross.

01:05.036 --> 01:06.770
See what I deal with?
Come here.

01:06.837 --> 01:08.505
Mm. Thank you.
(Doorbell rings)

01:08.572 --> 01:09.739
(Emmett) Pizza's here.

01:09.807 --> 01:12.775
- Here's a $20.
- Give 'em a tip.

01:17.547 --> 01:19.649
(Shouting questions at once)

01:19.716 --> 01:20.116
(Man) Are you aware
of your mother's past?

01:21.217 --> 01:22.851
- Dad!
- (Projector and camera shutter clicking)

01:22.853 --> 01:24.253
(Man) Did your mother tell you
about the affair she had?

01:24.254 --> 01:27.689
We are at the home of Ryocorp
C.E.O. Sarah Stanner...

01:27.757 --> 01:29.524
The married woman accused
of having an affair

01:29.591 --> 01:32.392
with Murray Randall, President
Grant's recently announced

01:32.460 --> 01:33.494
-  supreme court nominee. 
- The alleged extramarital affair

01:33.562 --> 01:36.131
happened 15 years ago
when Randall was

01:36.198 --> 01:38.033
Stanner's Professor
at Harvard law...

01:38.100 --> 01:39.267
Confirmation hearings
have become a battleground

01:39.335 --> 01:40.735
for partisan wrangling,

01:40.803 --> 01:42.304
<i>and if this is what</i>
<i>the democrats meant</i>

01:42.371 --> 01:43.871
<i>by, quote, "vetting thoroughly,"</i>

01:43.939 --> 01:45.439
<i>I'd say they've made good</i>
<i>on their threat.</i>

01:45.506 --> 01:48.108
Is it true? What they're
saying about mom?

01:48.176 --> 01:49.810
No, sweetie, of course not.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.878
When you have an important
job like your mom's,

01:51.947 --> 01:54.048
sometimes people...
Try to tear you down.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.916
Tell your brother to brush
his teeth and wash up for bed.

01:55.984 --> 01:58.218
No tv, no computer...
Not tonight, okay?

01:58.286 --> 02:00.186
Um... yes, right.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.921
Um, let me just grab a...

02:01.989 --> 02:03.456
<i>But it certainly</i>
<i>has provided...</i>

02:03.523 --> 02:06.259
O-okay, thank you.
I will. Bye.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.927
What'd the lawyer say?

02:07.995 --> 02:11.264
She's sending someone in
named Olivia Pope.

(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

02:26.312 --> 02:27.546
(Door opens) Sorry I'm late.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.981
I would have called,
but I was in a meeting.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.584
Don't worry. I've been keeping
myself entertained.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.885
Oh.
This one is truly special.

02:33.953 --> 02:36.588
Well, Yasmin was
a one-in-a-million kind of girl.

02:36.655 --> 02:39.090
She loved long walks,
dry climates, spitting.

02:39.157 --> 02:42.460
(Cell phone chimes)

02:42.528 --> 02:45.329
(Sighs) Let me guess.

02:45.397 --> 02:47.765
That means that we are not
having dinner, doesn't it?

02:47.833 --> 02:49.332
It's work.
I have to go.

02:51.035 --> 02:52.536
I was going to bring
this up over dinner,

02:52.604 --> 02:55.438
but I guess now I won't
have a chance, so...

02:55.507 --> 02:57.007
What do you know about

02:57.074 --> 02:58.909
the Kashfari hostage situation?

02:58.977 --> 03:01.545
I work in military
intelligence.

03:01.613 --> 03:03.446
We're all pretty familiar
with it. Why?

03:03.515 --> 03:05.347
I came across some information
that might help.

03:05.415 --> 03:07.517
- You came across it?
- You can't tell anyone it came from me,

03:07.584 --> 03:09.284
and you can't bring it
to the C.I.A.

03:11.788 --> 03:13.155
I don't have the authority
to just show up

03:13.223 --> 03:14.524
with something like that.

03:14.591 --> 03:16.258
And aren't you hooked up

03:16.326 --> 03:17.326
pretty good
with the White House?

03:17.394 --> 03:18.794
I can't go that route.

03:18.862 --> 03:20.896
- And you can't tell me why.
- It could help.

03:20.963 --> 03:23.331
I wouldn't bring it to you
otherwise.

03:24.534 --> 03:25.834
I'll see what I can do.

03:27.336 --> 03:29.404
Are you sure you've got
to go back to work?

03:29.471 --> 03:31.907
I could come over, flip through
some of your photo albums.

03:31.974 --> 03:33.341
Yearbooks, maybe...
It's only fair.

03:33.409 --> 03:34.776
Maybe next time?

03:34.844 --> 03:36.444
- So there's gonna be a next time?
- (Laughs)

03:36.512 --> 03:38.345
I like the sound of that.

03:55.162 --> 03:56.262
- 12 outlets?
- 15.

03:56.329 --> 03:58.031
- That's a big story.
- The biggest.

03:58.098 --> 03:59.599
- No way we're getting past that.
- Not unseen, we're not.

03:59.667 --> 04:00.700
We wait.
Top of the hour.

04:00.768 --> 04:01.801
There a back door?

04:01.869 --> 04:03.636
Still have to go through
the side door. (Phone chimes)

04:03.704 --> 04:05.303
Top of the hour, people.
What? (Beep)

04:05.304 --> 04:06.138
You on this?

04:06.206 --> 04:08.074
- I'm on this.
- Good. Because it's not true.

04:08.141 --> 04:09.940
Then why can I hear you pacing?

04:10.008 --> 04:13.178
We stand behind him,
we stand behind his character.

04:13.245 --> 04:14.679
Randall's a judicial genius,
Liv,

04:14.746 --> 04:15.880
one of the finest
of our generation.

04:15.947 --> 04:17.348
He deserves to sit on the bench

04:17.416 --> 04:18.550
of the highest court
in the world.

04:18.617 --> 04:19.752
I am telling you,
it's not true.

04:19.819 --> 04:22.154
- He's not my client, Cy. She is.
- (Sighs)

04:22.155 --> 04:23.522
We're sitting ducks, Liv.
The press can practically

04:23.590 --> 04:25.422
- smell us from here.
- We should move now.

04:25.490 --> 04:27.723
I am asking you to
shut this down.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.627
Have Stanner deny it...
cleanly.

04:29.695 --> 04:31.628
And I will do whatever is in the best
interest of my client.

04:31.697 --> 04:34.165
(Harrison and Abby) - Liv.
- At the top of the hour. Time.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.366
8:59.

04:36.334 --> 04:38.134
(Reporters speaking
indistinctly)

04:41.138 --> 04:42.305
- Now?
- 9:00.

04:42.372 --> 04:44.373
Now.
(Doors open)

04:44.441 --> 04:46.642
And we are back live
at the home of Sarah Stanner.

04:46.710 --> 04:49.011
Live at the home of Ryocorp
C.E.O. Sarah Stanner.

04:49.079 --> 04:50.479
Coming to you live
from the Stanner home...

04:50.547 --> 04:54.617
(Reporters continue
indistinctly)

04:54.685 --> 04:58.453
- Top of the hour.
- Top of the hour.

04:58.521 --> 05:00.588
<i>But there are other questions</i>
<i>that need to be answered.</i>

05:00.656 --> 05:02.557
Hi. You must be
Olivia Pope.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.826
I'm Olivia Pope.

05:04.894 --> 05:06.395
Your lawyer said you had kids.

05:06.462 --> 05:08.463
Yeah. Two. Why?

05:08.531 --> 05:10.332
You need to lock all your
windows, close your blinds.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.733
First thing in the morning,
we're gonna send your kids

05:11.801 --> 05:13.867
to stay with a close relative,
someone you trust.

05:13.936 --> 05:16.070
Well, my sister Nancy lives
20 minutes away.

05:16.138 --> 05:18.539
- Good. They'll go there.
- You put out the trash today?

05:18.606 --> 05:20.308
- Yeah. Why?
- Needs to come in.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.910
Wh... (Chuckles) Why would
they go through our garbage?

05:22.978 --> 05:25.813
I-I don't know what you're
used to dealing with, Ms. Pope,

05:25.880 --> 05:28.015
- but we're just normal people.
- Phil.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.849
The press is accusing your wife
of having an affair

05:29.917 --> 05:31.584
with one of the most polarizing
political figures

05:31.652 --> 05:34.020
in the news right now,
so normal is over.

05:34.088 --> 05:36.189
Normal ended hours ago.
And, yes, Sarah,

05:36.257 --> 05:37.790
they're going to dig up anything
and everything about you

05:37.858 --> 05:40.593
they can get their hands on...
Your trash, your voicemail,

05:40.661 --> 05:42.429
your bank statements,
your prescription history...

05:42.496 --> 05:45.332
It's all fair game.
Now, I will do everything I can

05:45.399 --> 05:46.766
to protect you,
to get you through this,

05:46.834 --> 05:48.935
but in order to do that,
in order to do my job,

05:49.002 --> 05:50.636
I need to know how much
trouble we're in,

05:50.704 --> 05:52.772
how much damage control
we're going to need to do.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.508
So, I want to hear
everything that happened,

05:55.576 --> 05:59.311
all of it... every detail,
and it needs to be the truth.

05:59.379 --> 06:01.447
Was Murray Randall
your law Professor at Harvard?

06:01.514 --> 06:03.047
Did you have an affair
with him?

06:03.115 --> 06:04.483
Was he married?
Were you married?

06:04.550 --> 06:06.150
How much of what the press
is reporting is true?

06:10.022 --> 06:11.322
It's all true.

06:13.559 --> 06:14.993
All of it.

06:31.365 --> 06:32.565
What do you see?

06:32.633 --> 06:34.700
(Quinn) Osborne.

06:34.768 --> 06:36.736
And big guys in black suits.

06:36.803 --> 06:38.002
They look armed.

06:38.070 --> 06:39.771
- That's the shadow.
- The what?

06:39.838 --> 06:41.273
C.I.A. Director always
has a shadow.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.741
They live in his basement.

06:42.808 --> 06:44.208
They tail him all day,
every day.

06:44.277 --> 06:46.043
When he eats, they follow.
When he sleeps, they follow.

06:46.111 --> 06:48.280
When he goes to the bathroom,
they follow.

06:48.347 --> 06:50.047
So how are we ever supposed
to get to him?

06:50.115 --> 06:52.284
We don't need to get to him.
He needs to get away from <i>them.</i>

06:52.351 --> 06:54.551
A mole trades in information.

06:54.619 --> 06:56.687
So how can he ever get away
from them to make a drop?

06:56.755 --> 06:58.155
He can't, so he won't.

06:58.222 --> 06:59.390
He'll make the drop
in plain sight,

06:59.457 --> 07:01.358
somewhere public.

07:01.426 --> 07:02.793
We wait for that.

07:04.862 --> 07:07.798
You're good at this...
Stalking people.

07:07.865 --> 07:09.166
You'll get there.

07:10.567 --> 07:11.834
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

07:11.902 --> 07:14.003
If you think that man's
going to prioritize

07:14.070 --> 07:15.405
a little late-night
chitchat...

07:15.472 --> 07:18.240
(Playful voice) Over feeding
his own child,

07:18.309 --> 07:20.576
you just don't know him.
Isn't that right?

07:20.644 --> 07:21.877
I need to see the President
right now.

07:21.945 --> 07:23.078
I'm sorry, he's not a...

07:23.146 --> 07:24.781
He... he doesn't
want to be disturbed.

07:24.848 --> 07:26.648
Who's he in there with?
(Whispers) I can't say.

07:26.716 --> 07:28.750
Lauren, I hired you,
hand-picked you to be

07:28.818 --> 07:30.919
the person who sits at this desk
and answers this phone.

07:30.986 --> 07:32.654
I did that, Lauren,
and I chose you.

07:32.722 --> 07:34.189
You owe me, and you're going
to let me in there.

07:34.256 --> 07:36.191
Mr. Beene, I can't,
not until he gives me...

07:36.258 --> 07:37.693
Not until his wife comes in

07:37.760 --> 07:40.061
with his beautiful baby boy.

07:40.129 --> 07:41.329
Right?
I need to see him <i>now.</i>

07:44.966 --> 07:46.099
(Knock on door)

07:48.804 --> 07:51.439
Mr. Beene and the First Lady both
here to see you, sir. (Door closes)

07:51.506 --> 07:53.774
Cyrus! What is it?

07:55.811 --> 07:58.678
(Sighs)

07:58.746 --> 08:00.714
There's a story
on Murray Randall.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.281
It's a problem.
What do you mean,
there's a story?

08:02.350 --> 08:04.183
We vetted him extensively.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.785
It's just an old affair.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.454
It'll blow over
a single news cycle,

08:07.521 --> 08:08.888
then he'll be confirmed
as planned.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.857
I have American citizens
who are about to get

08:10.924 --> 08:13.459
their heads chopped off
by terrorists, Cyrus.

08:13.526 --> 08:14.827
You told me this guy was clean,

08:14.894 --> 08:16.094
and I do not need this now.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.730
- Sir...
- Just fix it.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.533
One news cycle.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.402
That's all we can spare.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.538
The First Lady, sir.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.106
- Where's that boy?
- Right here!

08:28.174 --> 08:30.074
Where's my buddy?
(Speaks indistinctly)

08:30.141 --> 08:31.809
- Yes! Are you hungry?
(Kisses) - Oh, boy.

08:31.877 --> 08:33.745
- Did I keep you waiting?
- He's hungry.

08:33.812 --> 08:36.179
- Want to have a snack? I know
you're hungry. - Oh, he is.

08:36.248 --> 08:38.716
- Let's have a little...
- (Exhales)

08:38.784 --> 08:40.852
(Indistinct conversations,
camera shutters clicking)

08:40.919 --> 08:44.288
What proof is out there?
What did they find?

08:44.356 --> 08:46.390
There's some e-mails.

08:46.457 --> 08:48.558
Then you'll need to make
a public statement.

08:48.626 --> 08:51.495
Tomorrow morning we'll set up
a microphone outside.

08:51.562 --> 08:53.129
You want me to get up there
in front of the world

08:53.197 --> 08:54.398
and say I cheated?

08:54.465 --> 08:56.032
We want to make this story

08:56.100 --> 08:57.868
about a philandering
supreme court nominee,

08:57.935 --> 09:00.270
not a philandering C.E.O.
and mother of two.

09:00.337 --> 09:03.273
Now, hopefully there are
other women he slept with

09:03.340 --> 09:04.540
who will come out
of the woodwork

09:04.608 --> 09:06.042
and take the spotlight
off your family.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.544
But in the meantime,
if you want this to go away

09:08.612 --> 09:10.880
as soon as possible,
you need to come clean...

09:10.948 --> 09:12.181
Publicly.

09:14.818 --> 09:16.119
Do it.

09:18.922 --> 09:20.122
Are you sure?

09:20.189 --> 09:22.690
It's been 15 years.

09:24.693 --> 09:26.461
I think you should do it,
Sarah.

09:29.432 --> 09:31.633
(Camera shutters clicking)

09:31.700 --> 09:35.602
And now I'd like
to set the record straight.

09:35.670 --> 09:38.139
I had a sexual relationship
with Murray Randall

09:38.206 --> 09:40.174
15 years ago when I was
his law student.

09:40.242 --> 09:42.543
He was married at the time,
as was I.

09:42.610 --> 09:45.579
The affair was brief.

09:45.647 --> 09:48.682
I got no preferential
treatment in his class...
(Cell phone chiming)

09:48.750 --> 09:50.583
Nor was my career

09:50.651 --> 09:52.252
as a successful
businesswoman impacted by...

09:52.320 --> 09:54.321
- Take a breath.
- Don't you dare

09:54.388 --> 09:56.589
- tell me to...
- I will not be responsible

09:56.657 --> 09:58.458
for an untimely heart attack.
Take a breath.

09:58.525 --> 10:00.726
Do you have any idea
what we're up against?

10:00.794 --> 10:03.029
Between the nomination
and the hostage crisis,

10:03.097 --> 10:06.465
the American public is willing
to forgive one snafu a term.

10:06.532 --> 10:08.767
- They don't forgive two.
- That is not what this is about.

10:08.835 --> 10:10.502
I just got back
in the inner circle, Liv.

10:10.570 --> 10:11.903
He's listening again.

10:11.972 --> 10:13.772
And all I asked you for
was a simple denial.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.276
Murray Randall is not my client.
The President is not my client.

10:17.344 --> 10:18.910
You're doing this
because he's anti-choice?

10:18.979 --> 10:20.545
I'm apolitical.
You know that.

10:20.613 --> 10:22.213
Is your vagina apolitical?

10:22.281 --> 10:24.782
- Good-bye, Cy.
- We're gonna hit you back, Liv.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.517
We've got to. We're gonna
hit you back hard.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.019
- Cyrus?
- Yes?

10:28.087 --> 10:29.587
Do your best.

10:29.654 --> 10:31.155
(Clicks phone)

10:31.223 --> 10:33.057
(Sam & Dave's "soul man"
playing)

10:33.125 --> 10:35.493
You are no longer just pundits,
talking heads.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.962
You are assassins...
Character assassins.

10:38.029 --> 10:40.063
And your target
is Sarah Stanner.

10:40.131 --> 10:42.599
When we nominate a justice
to the supreme court,

10:42.666 --> 10:44.868
we need to know that there are
no skeletons in their closet

10:44.935 --> 10:46.736
that the democrats
can use against us.

10:46.804 --> 10:49.072
It was an oversight,
and I apologize, sir.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.374
So it was an affair then?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.109
It was an affair, yes.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.443
Mrs. Stanner, who up until
this morning

10:53.511 --> 10:56.112
was a successful C.E.O.
and mother of two,

10:56.179 --> 10:58.080
but who is, as of now...
(Bangs wall)

10:58.148 --> 11:01.317
A dangerously unhinged stalker

11:01.385 --> 11:03.685
hell-bent on
Murray Randall's destruction.

11:03.753 --> 11:05.587
She's a good person,
Mr. President.

11:05.655 --> 11:07.689
I always admired
her work ethic,

11:07.757 --> 11:09.925
and I've been pleased
to follow her career

11:09.993 --> 11:11.326
over the years.

11:11.394 --> 11:12.793
The less damage we can do
to her character...

11:12.861 --> 11:14.662
Murray, do you think
you have any say

11:14.730 --> 11:16.697
over how we treat
this woman's character

11:16.765 --> 11:18.166
after what you've done?

11:18.234 --> 11:20.135
You lost your say
the moment we asked

11:20.202 --> 11:22.037
if you would like to be
on the supreme court

11:22.104 --> 11:24.972
of the United States of America,
and you said yes.

11:25.041 --> 11:27.707
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
Mrs. Stanner, then a law student

11:27.775 --> 11:30.110
in judge Randall's
constitutional law class,

11:30.178 --> 11:32.546
was stalking the judge,
according to sources.

11:32.613 --> 11:34.614
Exhibit "a"...
Her e-mails to the judge,

11:34.682 --> 11:36.850
who never wrote back,
as far as we can tell.

11:36.918 --> 11:38.685
We can't say this stuff
on tv, Cy.

11:38.753 --> 11:40.320
Which is why we leak it online.

11:40.388 --> 11:42.355
Then, when you're asked
about it, you say...

11:42.423 --> 11:44.190
This woman
was a sexual predator

11:44.258 --> 11:47.260
who zeroed in on judge Randall
with unwanted attention

11:47.327 --> 11:50.561
from the very start of the
torts class she took from him.

11:50.564 --> 11:52.498
And I don't know if you've
had a chance to look

11:52.566 --> 11:54.200
at some of the e-mails
she wrote,

11:54.268 --> 11:57.670
but she was definitely
hot for teacher.

11:57.737 --> 11:59.337
To say that she went after him
is an understatement.

11:59.405 --> 12:00.672
I mean, we're on cable tv
right now.

12:00.739 --> 12:02.040
We can't read a sentence
of this stuff out loud

12:02.108 --> 12:03.275
without the F.C.C.
shutting you down.

12:03.342 --> 12:04.642
And he tried to take
the high road

12:04.710 --> 12:06.144
throughout this
whole sordid ordeal.

12:06.212 --> 12:07.912
He never replied
to any of it... not once.

12:07.980 --> 12:09.781
Back off, or I'll release
the other side

12:09.848 --> 12:11.383
of that e-mail correspondence.

12:11.451 --> 12:13.685
There isn't one,
as I'm sure you know.

12:13.752 --> 12:15.486
She wrote to him.
He didn't write back.

12:15.554 --> 12:17.421
Classic sexual harassment.

12:17.489 --> 12:19.256
Or does that only matter when
it's boy on girl? (Phone beeps)

12:19.324 --> 12:21.024
Sir, I found a classmate.

12:21.093 --> 12:23.594
- A successful attractive
female partisan one? - Oh, yes.

12:23.661 --> 12:25.529
(Pounds table)
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:25.597 --> 12:27.164
Honestly, none of this
comes as a surprise.

12:27.232 --> 12:28.765
She was always telling
anyone who'd listen

12:28.833 --> 12:30.500
how hot she thought
Professor Randall was.

12:30.568 --> 12:32.935
<i>I mean, I guess her husband</i>
<i>believed whatever she told him,</i>

12:33.003 --> 12:34.704
<i>but how could he be</i>
<i>so stupid?</i>

12:34.771 --> 12:37.807
Those pictures aren't
even from law school.

12:37.874 --> 12:41.377
That is undergrad. Spring break.
This is absurd. (Clicks button)

12:41.445 --> 12:44.714
This is... we... we have kids,
Ms. Pope. We have a daughter.

12:44.781 --> 12:46.115
It's just gonna get uglier.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.350
There's a supreme court
nomination at stake.

12:48.418 --> 12:50.452
They're gonna do everything
they can to paint judge Randall

12:50.520 --> 12:52.387
as the innocent victim here.

12:52.455 --> 12:54.523
(Cell phone chiming) We've got to
push back, change the narrative.

12:54.591 --> 12:56.125
Harrison.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.659
Ryocorp's saying the affair

12:57.727 --> 12:59.060
violates the company's
morality clause,

12:59.129 --> 13:00.362
- which means...
- I know what it means.

13:00.430 --> 13:02.063
(Phone beeps)

13:03.965 --> 13:06.033
- We've got another problem.
- What?

13:06.101 --> 13:07.368
Ryocorp thinks
you're in violation

13:07.436 --> 13:08.802
of their morality clause.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.738
They're gonna sue me
for breach of contract,

13:10.805 --> 13:13.274
- take away my shares?
- I don't understand.

13:13.342 --> 13:14.942
They want Sarah to resign
as C.E.O. effective immediately.

13:15.010 --> 13:17.011
They're firing her.

13:27.911 --> 13:29.611
- Lauren.
- Hello, ma'am.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.279
I was wondering
if I could get a look

13:31.347 --> 13:32.281
- at the President's schedule.

13:32.348 --> 13:34.048
Your chief of staff
should have a copy, ma'am.

13:34.049 --> 13:36.217
She does, but I wanted
to see your copy.

13:36.684 --> 13:38.284
Ma'am?
Lauren.

13:40.955 --> 13:42.490
(Exhales) (Mouse clicks)

13:42.557 --> 13:44.158
See? Right there.

13:44.226 --> 13:46.393
That meeting isn't on
my chief of staff's version

13:46.461 --> 13:47.661
of the schedule.
It's so late at night,

13:47.729 --> 13:50.063
and three times a week.
Who is it?

13:50.131 --> 13:51.132
I'm afraid I can't say, ma'am.

13:51.199 --> 13:52.665
Lauren...

13:52.733 --> 13:54.100
Uh, I can't say
because I don't know.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.836
Honestly. It must be
a phone meeting.

13:56.903 --> 14:00.406
I just... I-I don't know.

14:00.474 --> 14:02.509
He places the calls himself?

14:02.576 --> 14:05.378
There's no... phone log?

14:08.214 --> 14:12.217
Of course
the President agreed, sir.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.154
So we can count on
your support, senator?

14:15.221 --> 14:16.821
(Exhaling)

14:16.889 --> 14:18.957
You won't regret it.
(Hangs up phone) Ahh...

14:19.025 --> 14:21.593
(Applause)

14:21.661 --> 14:22.961
Andy, get some champagne
in here.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.062
We just pushed this
nomination through.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.198
(Cheers and applause) Yes!

14:27.266 --> 14:28.466
(Cheering continues)

14:28.534 --> 14:30.501
What are we celebrating?

14:30.569 --> 14:31.835
(Cheering stops)

14:33.104 --> 14:35.306
May we have a moment, please?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.175
(Murmuring)

14:45.550 --> 14:46.917
Why didn't you tell me?

14:46.985 --> 14:48.318
Tell you what?

14:48.386 --> 14:50.220
That he is calling her again,

14:50.788 --> 14:53.156
that he is <i>sleeping</i>
with <i>her</i> again.

14:53.224 --> 14:54.757
I've seen his real schedule.

14:54.825 --> 14:57.060
I know he's blocking off time
late at night,

14:57.127 --> 14:58.694
and I know that can only
mean one thing.

14:58.761 --> 15:00.462
I don't have time
to listen to this,

15:00.530 --> 15:02.431
because I'm back
in his good graces, Mellie.

15:02.499 --> 15:05.000
So where your husband is dipping
his signing pen these days

15:05.068 --> 15:06.068
isn't my primary concern.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.769
You know as well as I do

15:07.837 --> 15:09.305
that once Olivia gets
her claws in him again,

15:09.372 --> 15:11.973
it will be back to divorce
and taking us all down.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.841
Here's what I know.
I know that he hasn't

15:13.909 --> 15:15.376
mentioned the word "divorce"
in almost a year.

15:15.444 --> 15:17.011
I know that getting involved in

15:17.079 --> 15:19.280
your messy little love triangle
has never gotten me anywhere.

15:19.348 --> 15:21.816
And I also know
that I just saved him

15:21.883 --> 15:23.784
a major public embarrassment...

15:23.852 --> 15:25.920
Which, after the hostage crisis

15:25.987 --> 15:29.123
and your unfortunate
conference call fiasco

15:29.191 --> 15:30.657
means that while you may be
wandering out

15:30.725 --> 15:33.126
in the White House version
of a siberian work camp,

15:33.194 --> 15:37.431
I'm curled up
by the fire inside.

15:37.498 --> 15:40.133
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the President is waiting...

15:40.201 --> 15:42.369
(Exhales)

15:42.437 --> 15:43.704
For me.

15:48.074 --> 15:49.775
(Cell phone chimes)

15:49.843 --> 15:50.843
(Clicks phone)

15:53.647 --> 15:54.747
(Door closes)

15:57.484 --> 15:59.619
How did you find me?

15:59.686 --> 16:01.586
I'm a professional.
And it's not like

16:01.654 --> 16:03.355
you're holed up
in some cave in Tora Bora.

16:03.422 --> 16:06.491
Do you know what these are?
These are fax transmissions

16:06.559 --> 16:08.427
sent to a number in Kashfar
two weeks ago.

16:08.494 --> 16:09.962
They're dossiers
on the aide workers.

16:10.029 --> 16:10.829
They're not aide workers.

16:10.830 --> 16:13.197
On the operatives
that were taken hostage.

16:13.266 --> 16:14.766
Did you get this from
the woman who called me,

16:14.833 --> 16:17.301
the one who died... Wendy?

16:17.369 --> 16:19.169
If I'm gonna do something
with this,

16:19.237 --> 16:20.671
I need to know that it's legit.

16:20.739 --> 16:22.339
I need to know
where you got it,

16:22.407 --> 16:24.308
because if I push my way
through certain rooms

16:24.376 --> 16:25.842
and this intel is bogus,

16:25.910 --> 16:27.411
it's my ass on the line.
I'm through.

16:27.479 --> 16:28.746
I can't tell you how I got it,

16:28.813 --> 16:30.981
but I can promise you
it's legit.

16:31.048 --> 16:32.949
And I just have to trust you?

16:33.017 --> 16:35.518
That's how this works, right?

16:35.586 --> 16:38.120
- Mm.
- Miss Pope?

16:38.188 --> 16:40.323
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
(Olivia clears throat)

16:40.391 --> 16:42.158
Thank you.
You're welcome.

16:42.225 --> 16:44.794
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

16:44.861 --> 16:46.862
Comes with the territory.

16:48.932 --> 16:50.932
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

16:51.000 --> 16:52.935
Come on, Samantha.
We're not talking about

16:52.936 --> 16:54.670
naked photos or slander
against the company.

16:54.737 --> 16:56.305
Who hasn't sent
a dirty e-mail or two?

16:56.372 --> 16:58.507
- Oh... try 200.
- It's a rite of passage.

16:58.574 --> 16:59.774
- Not for C.E.O.S.
- Ohh...

16:59.785 --> 17:01.510
She's a public figure,
the face of our company.

17:01.578 --> 17:02.978
She wasn't a public figure
at the time of the alleged

17:03.045 --> 17:04.313
compromise
of the morality clause.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.513
She was a kid. She was 24.
She was in school.

17:06.582 --> 17:08.116
She was married.
In any case,

17:08.183 --> 17:09.517
the legal language
is clear as day.

17:09.585 --> 17:11.452
I know you're under
pressure from the board.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.721
Stock prices are taking
a hit over this scandal.

17:13.788 --> 17:16.223
But if you continue this sexist
campaign against my client,

17:16.290 --> 17:18.259
it's gonna get ugly.

17:18.327 --> 17:19.893
You're pretty.

17:19.961 --> 17:22.194
(Laughs)
And you talk real fast,

17:22.262 --> 17:23.497
but I think I can take you.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.232
And just in case I can't,

17:25.299 --> 17:27.334
I've got an army of lawyers
and unlimited funds

17:27.401 --> 17:28.869
in my war chest.

17:28.937 --> 17:30.671
You're outgunned.

17:30.739 --> 17:33.007
Mnh. I'm armed.
With one single fact.

17:33.074 --> 17:34.441
We wouldn't be having
this discussion

17:34.509 --> 17:36.243
if Sarah were a Saul
or a Steve,

17:36.310 --> 17:38.178
and <i>that</i> double standard
will become front and center

17:38.246 --> 17:40.313
in the coverage of this scandal
until the name Ryocorp

17:40.381 --> 17:41.848
is synonymous
with discrimination,

17:41.915 --> 17:43.983
until you have to change
the name on every door

17:44.051 --> 17:45.685
and web site and business card.

17:45.753 --> 17:47.487
Until you have to use
a good portion

17:47.555 --> 17:50.290
of those unlimited funds
rebranding your company.

17:50.358 --> 17:52.659
Like I said...

17:52.726 --> 17:54.160
Ugly.

17:58.731 --> 18:00.299
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
(Indistinct conversations)

18:00.367 --> 18:02.100
Good news.

18:02.169 --> 18:03.969
The morality clause
is off the table... for now.
(Door closes)

18:04.037 --> 18:05.771
- So I can keep my job?
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.838 --> 18:07.473
That's amazing.
That is the...

18:07.541 --> 18:09.241
First good news we've had
all week.

18:09.309 --> 18:10.875
(Cell phone chimes)

18:10.942 --> 18:12.810
- Abby.
- The good news is

18:12.878 --> 18:14.312
the affair
was a 2-way street.

18:14.380 --> 18:16.214
A retired security guard
came forward with footage

18:16.282 --> 18:18.916
from a weekend getaway
at a 4-star resort in Cabo.

18:18.984 --> 18:20.418
They were making out
all over the lobby.

18:20.486 --> 18:22.953
- Did you get a hard copy?
- I did, but, Liv,

18:23.021 --> 18:24.855
the date stamp...
It doesn't match the e-mail.

18:24.923 --> 18:27.757
It's from about a year later.

18:27.825 --> 18:29.660
<i>(News program</i>
<i>instrumental theme playing)</i>

18:29.727 --> 18:31.828
Turn that up.

How many lies have you told me?

I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

18:56.853 --> 18:59.187
What the hell has
our marriage even been?

18:59.255 --> 19:00.822
Did you...

19:00.889 --> 19:02.591
<i>Do you</i> love him?
Are you still screwing him?

19:02.658 --> 19:05.059
- No, of course not. No.
- I don't believe you.

19:05.127 --> 19:07.161
I don't believe anything
you say to me.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.496
I don't believe you!

19:08.564 --> 19:10.865
Wait. Two years.

19:10.933 --> 19:13.468
That's 2000!

19:13.536 --> 19:16.237
Annie was born in 2001.

19:16.304 --> 19:18.105
Phil, please.
Is she my daughter?

19:18.172 --> 19:20.441
Of course she is.
Of course she's yours.

19:20.508 --> 19:22.343
I don't believe this!
I... I don't...

19:22.410 --> 19:24.645
You know what? I don't care!
I don't give a damn!

19:24.713 --> 19:26.247
- I'm leaving.
- No.

19:26.314 --> 19:27.814
- Just get out of my way.
I'm leaving. - Phil...

19:27.882 --> 19:29.883
Just... just get the hell
away from me!

19:29.951 --> 19:31.351
You can't leave,
not with the press outside!

19:31.418 --> 19:32.719
- Phil!
- Go!

19:34.655 --> 19:37.957
(Reporters clamoring
and shouting questions)

19:38.024 --> 19:39.492
Hey!

19:39.560 --> 19:41.594
- Get the hell off my lawn!
- Phil, come on.

19:41.662 --> 19:44.530
I want you all off my property!
Now!

19:44.598 --> 19:47.065
Come on!

19:47.133 --> 19:49.568
Mr. Stanner, were you aware
that the affair continued?

19:49.636 --> 19:51.069
(Clamoring continues)

19:51.137 --> 19:54.139
Phil. Listen. Come on.

19:54.206 --> 19:56.341
Let's not do this out here.
Not in front of the cameras.

19:56.409 --> 19:58.343
They're just gonna follow
you down the street.

19:58.411 --> 20:00.078
(Reporters shouting questions)
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

20:07.489 --> 20:10.758
(Exhales)
He just left the bank.

20:10.825 --> 20:12.260
He waited in line
to make a deposit.

20:12.327 --> 20:14.362
You think that's the drop?
I think it could be the drop.

20:14.429 --> 20:16.063
(Huck) Why?

20:16.131 --> 20:17.931
'Cause who makes a deposit
at a bank these days?

20:17.999 --> 20:20.134
You do it online or use an ATM.

20:20.201 --> 20:22.034
- It's not the drop.
- Why not?

20:22.102 --> 20:23.303
Why not?

20:23.371 --> 20:25.739
Because tellers
are searched nightly

20:25.806 --> 20:27.407
and there are security
cameras everywhere.

20:27.475 --> 20:30.009
Yep.

20:30.077 --> 20:31.911
I'm gonna follow him.

20:31.979 --> 20:33.480
You sure you want to do that?

20:33.547 --> 20:35.114
Yeah. We can't see in.
It could be the drop.

20:35.182 --> 20:36.615
Why? You don't think
I should?

20:36.683 --> 20:39.117
I think you should do
what you think you should do.

20:39.185 --> 20:40.352
(Phone beeps)

20:42.589 --> 20:45.291
Thanks a lot. Have a nice day.
(Door bell dings)

20:45.358 --> 20:47.660
- Hi. Picking up or dropping off?
- Picking up.

20:47.727 --> 20:50.396
Number is 555-0199.
(Door bell dings)

20:50.463 --> 20:54.031
(Whirring)

20:54.099 --> 20:56.567
Picking up or dropping off?

21:08.346 --> 21:09.912
(Sighs)

21:11.848 --> 21:13.649
I know. I know.

21:13.717 --> 21:16.252
That's why you don't do
cover without the right props.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.121
One of those guys could have
made you, and for what?

21:18.188 --> 21:20.289
Nothing.
I got his phone number.

21:20.357 --> 21:21.724
You think the director
of the C.I.A.

21:21.791 --> 21:23.926
uses his real phone number
to pick up his dry cleaning?

21:23.994 --> 21:25.094
No.

21:25.161 --> 21:26.928
- Need a shirt?
- Yes, please.

21:30.133 --> 21:32.334
(Telephone rings)
Harrison Wright.

21:32.401 --> 21:35.203
- You know what's ugly, Harrison?
- Samantha! (Laughs)

21:35.271 --> 21:36.605
So good to hear from you again.

21:36.672 --> 21:38.072
Ugly is when you tell
your husband

21:38.141 --> 21:39.907
you're at a work conference
one weekend a month

21:39.975 --> 21:43.277
so you can go screw
your married lover in Mexico.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.946
I don't know
what you've heard, but...

21:46.014 --> 21:47.814
For two years straight.

21:47.882 --> 21:49.617
And it's just that kind
of ugliness

21:49.684 --> 21:51.084
that the ryocorp
mortality clause

21:51.153 --> 21:52.586
is designed to protect against.

21:54.489 --> 21:56.089
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

21:56.158 --> 21:57.590
Where are we at with Randall?

21:57.658 --> 21:58.991
After the hotel romp in Mexico,

21:59.059 --> 22:00.960
he has almost no support.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.029
There's no sense in trying
to ram it through.

22:03.096 --> 22:04.531
He's declining
first thing in the morning.

22:04.598 --> 22:06.199
I'm having Scotty
draft a statement.

22:06.267 --> 22:07.667
And who else do we have
on deck?

22:07.734 --> 22:09.735
Soteras. Habinek
over on the 9th circuit.

22:09.803 --> 22:12.539
Murphy, but she's got
the housekeeper thing from '96.

22:12.606 --> 22:14.139
So no one anywhere near
as good as Randall?

22:14.207 --> 22:15.541
We had the votes
to push it through.

22:15.608 --> 22:17.242
Sir, if...

22:17.310 --> 22:20.345
If Liv had gotten her client
to issue a denial

22:20.413 --> 22:22.881
from the start, all this
could have been avoided.

22:22.948 --> 22:24.816
Olivia was behind
tanking Randall?

22:24.884 --> 22:27.286
She's representing
S-Sarah Stanner, sir.

22:27.353 --> 22:29.120
I thought you knew.

22:29.188 --> 22:30.888
I need a minute, Cyrus.

22:30.955 --> 22:32.323
- Sir...
- I need a minute.

22:53.977 --> 22:55.412
(Door closes) (Sighs)

22:55.479 --> 22:56.946
You're staying the night again?

22:57.014 --> 22:58.381
We're nearing
arctic temperatures in there.

22:58.449 --> 22:59.882
They shouldn't be alone.

22:59.950 --> 23:01.783
I want the two of you to focus
on her legal case.

23:01.851 --> 23:03.285
The board's voting
tomorrow afternoon

23:03.353 --> 23:05.020
on whether to fire her
over the morality clause.

23:05.088 --> 23:06.255
Her personal life's
falling apart.

23:06.323 --> 23:09.325
The least we can do is try
to save her job.

23:09.392 --> 23:11.293
(Cell phone chimes)

23:11.361 --> 23:12.761
(Beep)

23:12.829 --> 23:14.363
Cyrus, I already told you...

23:14.431 --> 23:16.232
(Fitz) It's not Cyrus.

23:19.268 --> 23:21.636
I wish you'd just
been honest with me.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.071
I already told you,
I made a mistake.

23:24.139 --> 23:25.406
I don't mean about defiance.

23:27.343 --> 23:29.877
What do you mean...

23:29.945 --> 23:31.246
Fitz?

23:33.448 --> 23:36.049
What do you mean?

23:39.120 --> 23:41.121
Fitz...

23:41.188 --> 23:42.989
All those meetings!

23:43.057 --> 23:45.792
You... you're in Mexico,
screwing that guy!

23:45.860 --> 23:47.394
I-I trusted you!

23:47.462 --> 23:49.829
I-I'm sitting at home
like some kind of idiot.

23:49.897 --> 23:51.264
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

23:51.331 --> 23:52.632
We weren't getting along.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.533
I didn't know if we would last.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.402
You made damn sure we wouldn't.

23:56.470 --> 23:59.205
If you didn't think I was
good enough to be President...

23:59.273 --> 24:00.506
I did think you were.

24:00.574 --> 24:01.841
You didn't.

24:01.909 --> 24:04.177
You didn't.

24:04.245 --> 24:06.044
If you had...

24:06.112 --> 24:08.713
(Sarah) I love you.
I am sorry.

24:08.782 --> 24:11.183
I love you.
I was stupid.

24:11.251 --> 24:13.451
- I wish I could take it back.
- You can't!

24:13.519 --> 24:15.553
(Breathes deeply)
You know what?

24:15.621 --> 24:16.822
It doesn't matter.
I don't even know why...

24:16.890 --> 24:19.024
(Sighs)

24:19.092 --> 24:20.358
That's not why I called.

24:20.426 --> 24:23.194
Why did you call?

24:23.262 --> 24:27.432
I told myself I was calling...

24:27.500 --> 24:29.200
to tell you to back off

24:29.268 --> 24:31.102
from my supreme court
justice nominee.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.205
But really...

24:34.273 --> 24:35.440
I was calling because
apparently

24:35.508 --> 24:37.175
I haven't kicked myself
enough today,

24:37.242 --> 24:38.409
and I needed
a little more misery.

24:39.678 --> 24:42.279
(Breath quavers, sighs)

24:42.347 --> 24:44.114
I trusted you, you know?

24:44.182 --> 24:45.516
(Sighs)

24:45.583 --> 24:47.250
You were all I had.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.621
You ruined me.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.255
I'm ruined.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.357
(Gasps) <i>I'm</i> ruined!

24:54.425 --> 24:55.825
I don't care.

24:55.892 --> 24:57.893
(Phil) I will never
forgive you!

24:57.961 --> 25:00.430
- Phil...
- I want a paternity test.

25:03.099 --> 25:05.435
(Sighs)

25:05.502 --> 25:06.936
I'm going to hang up now.

25:07.003 --> 25:08.604
Okay, you do that.
(Line clicks)

25:08.672 --> 25:10.172
That's a good idea.

25:11.974 --> 25:12.841
(Clicks phone)

25:14.944 --> 25:16.778
(Sighs)

25:30.332 --> 25:31.732
Captain Ballard, sir.

25:31.801 --> 25:34.302
Send him in.

25:34.369 --> 25:35.636
Mr. President...

25:35.704 --> 25:37.404
I don't need an update
on her right now.

25:37.471 --> 25:38.538
(Door closes)
I'm well aware of what
she's been up to.

25:38.606 --> 25:40.373
This isn't about her.

25:43.077 --> 25:45.212
(Paper rustles)

25:51.352 --> 25:52.752
(Flips page)
Where'd you get these?

25:52.820 --> 25:55.321
An anonymous source sent them
to my office this morning.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.190
You see that fax number
at the top there?

25:57.257 --> 25:59.558
It's registered to a Kashfari
intelligence officer.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.093
One of our drones
just picked him up

26:01.161 --> 26:03.662
driving towards an armed
compound in Tenwar province.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.898
Place is a pretty well-known
safe haven for terrorists.

26:05.966 --> 26:08.067
- Who else knows about this?
- Just me and my immediate superiors.

26:08.135 --> 26:09.468
I felt it was best
to keep a leash on it

26:09.536 --> 26:11.769
- until I spoke to you.
- Is there a team in place?

26:11.838 --> 26:13.071
Just waiting
for your go-ahead, sir.

26:15.842 --> 26:18.877
- Good night, Lauren.
- Good night, captain Ballard.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.384
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
(Indistinct conversations)

26:30.989 --> 26:32.421
Don't judge me.

26:32.489 --> 26:33.923
(Closes door)

26:33.991 --> 26:35.925
No judgments.

26:35.993 --> 26:38.461
He wants a paternity test.

26:38.528 --> 26:41.630
But... you heard that.
I'm betting you heard that.

26:41.698 --> 26:43.166
I'm sorry.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.268
I know it must not be fun
having us in your house.

26:45.336 --> 26:46.870
No, it's, uh...
It's like a party.

26:46.937 --> 26:48.770
I love it. It's great.

26:48.838 --> 26:50.438
You have front-row seats
to the end of my marriage.

26:52.475 --> 26:55.377
(Exhales) Crap.
(Chuckles)

26:57.347 --> 26:59.081
I am a terrible host.

27:01.417 --> 27:03.118
You want a drink?
(Clattering)

27:03.186 --> 27:05.186
- No. I...
- You have to have a drink.

27:05.254 --> 27:06.854
Otherwise, I'm just
drinking alone.

27:06.922 --> 27:08.956
Sarah, it would be
unprofessional for me...

27:09.024 --> 27:10.892
I'm paying
for your time, right?

27:10.959 --> 27:14.595
This is my dime.
My many, many dimes.

27:14.662 --> 27:16.230
Have a drink with me.

27:16.298 --> 27:18.399
Drink the damn wine.

27:24.638 --> 27:26.506
(Sighs)

27:32.646 --> 27:34.948
Mmm. This is...

27:35.016 --> 27:36.481
A $300 bottle of wine.

27:36.549 --> 27:38.517
I was saving it
for an occasion.

27:38.584 --> 27:40.986
My husband calling me a whore
feels like an occasion.

27:43.957 --> 27:45.557
You made a mistake.

27:45.625 --> 27:47.626
No. I mean, yes, I did.

27:47.693 --> 27:49.795
Uh, cheating on him...
that was a mistake.

27:49.862 --> 27:53.932
Our marriage was...

27:53.999 --> 27:56.234
We weren't getting along.
I was young.

27:56.302 --> 27:57.902
I was dumb enough to think
it was okay

27:57.970 --> 28:01.005
if someone else turned me on,
and I made a mistake.

28:01.073 --> 28:02.773
The affair was a mistake.

28:02.841 --> 28:04.642
But that's not the thing.

28:04.709 --> 28:07.745
That's not what's
going to kill us.

28:07.813 --> 28:10.080
The mistake is nothing.

28:10.148 --> 28:11.648
It's that...

28:11.715 --> 28:13.850
It's that you never
told him the truth.

28:13.918 --> 28:17.120
It's that you let him
believe a lie.

28:18.522 --> 28:21.191
I didn't know.

28:21.259 --> 28:25.027
I don't know if Annie is his.

28:25.095 --> 28:28.130
But it would have...
hurt him if she wasn't,

28:28.198 --> 28:29.665
so I made a choice.

28:29.732 --> 28:31.834
You let him be her dad.

28:31.901 --> 28:34.003
I let him be her dad.

28:34.071 --> 28:38.441
Y-you think the only one
that's gonna suffer is you.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.575
You get a twinge
on father's day,

28:40.642 --> 28:43.711
you suck it up, you...
tell yourself,

28:43.779 --> 28:45.313
okay, this is the price
I'm paying.

28:45.381 --> 28:46.714
This is the cost.

28:46.782 --> 28:50.318
But it's not.
There's a much larger bill,

28:50.386 --> 28:53.888
and it comes due.

28:53.956 --> 28:56.891
And suddenly Olivia Pope
is in your living room.

29:01.229 --> 29:02.229
Damn.

29:05.567 --> 29:08.903
We really have to do the...
paternity test?

29:08.971 --> 29:11.438
You do. You should.

29:11.507 --> 29:12.873
If that's what he wants.

29:17.211 --> 29:19.379
(Inhales) There's a hairbrush
on her dresser.

29:19.446 --> 29:21.280
You can use that.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.754
You have some job.

29:27.822 --> 29:29.688
Fixer.

29:29.756 --> 29:31.424
How do you fix betrayal?

29:31.492 --> 29:34.193
Sarah, you betrayed him.

29:34.261 --> 29:35.694
You did.

29:35.762 --> 29:37.663
You messed up,
and there's a price.

29:37.731 --> 29:40.500
Betrayal always has a price.

29:42.769 --> 29:46.104
But let me ask you something.

29:46.172 --> 29:47.805
Is he a good dad?

29:47.873 --> 29:50.142
(Inhales sharply)

29:50.209 --> 29:51.843
(Exhales)

29:53.846 --> 29:56.348
He is a great dad.

29:59.052 --> 30:02.886
You did what you thought
was best at the time.

30:02.954 --> 30:05.923
Even if it was wrong,
you thought it was best.

30:05.990 --> 30:08.025
You can't change
the choice you made.

30:08.093 --> 30:13.164
All you can do is not
let it ruin you.

30:13.231 --> 30:15.599
And what if he never
forgives me?

30:17.268 --> 30:19.902
Then you're going to have to
learn to forgive yourself.

30:19.970 --> 30:21.371
(Sniffles)

30:23.707 --> 30:24.974
That sounds lonely.

30:25.042 --> 30:26.943
It is.

30:37.220 --> 30:40.089
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

30:40.156 --> 30:43.258
Okay, I've been thinking
about this dry cleaner thing.

30:43.326 --> 30:46.061
- What are you thinking?
- Director of the C.I.A.

30:46.129 --> 30:48.097
That's gotta be a job
where you have no free time.

30:48.164 --> 30:49.797
You're too busy
saving the world.

30:49.864 --> 30:52.200
So why does Osborne
go to the cleaners himself?

30:52.267 --> 30:55.136
- Any assistant could do that.
- Why do you think he goes?

30:55.204 --> 30:57.071
Because the best drops
happen in plain sight.

30:57.139 --> 31:00.208
Yes. They do.

31:06.814 --> 31:09.516
(Sighs)

31:09.584 --> 31:11.351
Got him. So easy.

31:11.419 --> 31:13.120
Just gave the number.
Check it.

31:13.187 --> 31:15.489
(Exhales)

31:15.556 --> 31:16.556
Inside pockets, too.

31:19.727 --> 31:20.827
(Rustling)

31:30.403 --> 31:32.138
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

31:32.205 --> 31:33.805
Oh, my God.
This has to be...

31:33.873 --> 31:35.441
20 grand at least.

31:35.509 --> 31:36.842
- Holy...
- Stay focused.

31:36.909 --> 31:39.277
What's next?

31:39.345 --> 31:40.545
He can't know we're onto him.

31:41.747 --> 31:44.249
(Rustles)

31:44.316 --> 31:46.284
Tell me this happens
all the time,

31:46.352 --> 31:48.953
because otherwise, I am gonna
feel like a total idiot.

31:49.021 --> 31:50.455
I must have given you
the wrong number,

31:50.523 --> 31:52.223
because these suits... they're
definitely not my husband's.

31:52.291 --> 31:54.491
Wrong size, wrong color,
just wrong, wrong, wrong.

31:54.559 --> 31:56.560
What's the phone number?

31:56.628 --> 31:58.428
(Exhales)

31:58.496 --> 31:59.896
You ever have one of those days

31:59.964 --> 32:01.665
where you just try
and do too much?

32:01.732 --> 32:03.634
He told me his suits weren't
going to be ready today,

32:03.701 --> 32:05.869
and I try to be superwoman,
do it all,

32:05.936 --> 32:07.638
make him dinner,
get his cleaning.

32:07.705 --> 32:09.905
He can get his own cleaning...
On Saturday,

32:09.973 --> 32:11.707
when it's ready.
(Breathes sharply)

32:11.775 --> 32:14.577
You have a better day
than I'm having.

32:14.645 --> 32:18.147
(Door bell dings)

32:18.215 --> 32:19.748
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
(Crow caws)

32:24.020 --> 32:25.753
Annie.

32:25.821 --> 32:27.389
What are you doing here?

32:27.456 --> 32:29.324
You're supposed to be
at school.

32:29.392 --> 32:31.526
Mackenzie Myers says
my dad isn't my real dad.

32:31.594 --> 32:33.528
Is that true?

32:33.596 --> 32:35.230
(Gasps softly)

32:35.298 --> 32:37.199
That's why you had
my hairbrush, right?

32:38.967 --> 32:41.202
So you can find out.

32:44.506 --> 32:46.773
(Sighs)

32:48.210 --> 32:50.511
(Gasps) I've seen the news.

32:50.579 --> 32:53.414
Aunt Nancy didn't know
I was watching,

32:53.481 --> 32:56.283
but I was.

32:58.719 --> 33:00.720
Your dad...

33:00.787 --> 33:03.523
will always be your dad,

33:03.591 --> 33:04.990
no matter what.

33:12.466 --> 33:13.298
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

33:13.366 --> 33:14.934
Here's Scotty's statement.
You should take a look.

33:15.002 --> 33:17.769
I've got Randall's office ready
to release it on your word.

33:17.837 --> 33:20.205
- Don't pull it yet.
- Sir?

33:20.273 --> 33:21.773
There's an operation under way

33:21.841 --> 33:23.375
to free the hostages
in Western Kashfar.

33:23.443 --> 33:25.577
Under way? Now?
Choppers are in the air.

33:25.645 --> 33:27.579
They'll be on the ground
in 25 minutes.

33:27.647 --> 33:30.114
I don't under...
Why didn't I know about this?

33:30.181 --> 33:32.149
I figured you had
your hands full.

33:32.217 --> 33:35.886
Just keep a lid on it until
I update you on the status.

33:35.954 --> 33:37.555
If this operation
is successful,

33:37.623 --> 33:39.857
we'll bury this whole
Murray Randall fiasco

33:39.924 --> 33:41.892
in a tidal wave of good news.

33:44.896 --> 33:46.263
Cyrus?

33:46.330 --> 33:48.064
Yes, sir?

33:48.132 --> 33:49.399
I believe the words
you're looking for

33:49.467 --> 33:50.433
are "thank you."

33:53.638 --> 33:55.305
(Door opens)

33:55.373 --> 33:57.707
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

34:03.112 --> 34:05.180
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

34:16.458 --> 34:18.393
(Fitz) My fellow Americans,

34:18.460 --> 34:20.995
at 5:37 P.M.
Greenwich Mean time,

34:21.062 --> 34:23.130
a Navy S.E.A.L. team
was dispatched

34:23.197 --> 34:25.232
to the Kashfari province
of Tenwar.

34:25.301 --> 34:28.436
<i>Their mission... to find</i>
<i>the three American aide workers</i>

34:28.504 --> 34:31.205
<i>taken hostage</i>
<i>and bring them back alive.</i>

34:35.042 --> 34:36.876
(Clicking)

34:36.944 --> 34:38.978
(Clatters)

34:39.045 --> 34:40.179
(Clicking)

34:41.449 --> 34:43.684
(Door opens, switch clicks)

34:43.751 --> 34:44.685
(Keys rattle)

34:48.088 --> 34:50.389
(Gunfire)

34:50.456 --> 34:54.092
(Both grunting)

34:56.262 --> 35:00.032
<i>(Gunfire continues on monitor)</i>

35:02.101 --> 35:04.470
(Grunting)

35:06.939 --> 35:08.973
(Fitz) The S.E.A.L. team
executed their mission

35:09.041 --> 35:10.542
without a single
American casualty.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.180
<i>Room's empty. No hostages.</i>

35:18.517 --> 35:20.385
Just take it! Take it!

35:20.453 --> 35:21.719
(Blow lands) (Grunts)

35:25.623 --> 35:27.023
(Man) Over here!

35:36.501 --> 35:39.369
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

35:39.436 --> 35:41.170
And as for the hostages...

35:41.238 --> 35:43.906
(Kicks, grunts)

35:46.343 --> 35:47.410
- Yes!
- Yes!

35:47.478 --> 35:49.044
(All exclaiming) (Claps)

35:49.112 --> 35:51.213
I'm proud to say
they're alive and well.

35:51.281 --> 35:53.815
(Exclaiming continues)

36:00.356 --> 36:02.924
God bless our servicemen
and women,

36:02.992 --> 36:04.593
and God bless America.

36:04.660 --> 36:09.097
(Cell phone rings)

36:09.164 --> 36:10.464
Mr. President.

36:10.532 --> 36:12.400
You did
a hell of a thing today.

36:12.467 --> 36:14.468
Just doing my job.

36:14.536 --> 36:15.536
(Clatters)

36:25.457 --> 36:27.759
(Harrison sighs)

36:27.827 --> 36:29.460
You get anything?

36:29.529 --> 36:31.329
(Scoffs) This contract
is so airtight.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.964
Board meeting's at 5:00.

36:33.032 --> 36:34.165
Too bad you don't sign
a morality clause

36:34.234 --> 36:35.167
before you get married...

36:35.235 --> 36:37.468
not that it would have
saved those two anyway.

36:37.537 --> 36:38.537
Why do you assume
their marriage is over?

36:38.605 --> 36:41.204
The way I see it, marriage is a
partnership. You add kids, it's a job.

36:41.272 --> 36:42.740
You think he's gonna be
able to work with her,

36:42.807 --> 36:44.341
be a team with her
after what she did to him?

36:44.409 --> 36:45.910
I work with you
after what you did to me.

36:45.977 --> 36:48.746
You basically tanked
me and David.

36:50.281 --> 36:54.718
Abby, I'm sorry about that.

36:54.786 --> 36:56.520
You know how sorry I am
about that.

36:56.587 --> 36:58.154
It's fine.
That's my point.

36:58.221 --> 37:00.189
People get betrayed,
people betray.

37:00.257 --> 37:02.058
You deal with it
and you move on.

37:02.125 --> 37:03.927
If it's a partnership,
if it's a job, you move on.

37:03.994 --> 37:07.764
Abby, I will apologize
every single day

37:07.831 --> 37:09.198
if that'll make things better.

37:09.266 --> 37:11.868
I'm not mad, Harrison.
I'm not.

37:11.936 --> 37:13.769
But you're different.

37:13.836 --> 37:18.106
With me. I mean,
you're the exact same...

37:18.174 --> 37:19.575
But you're completely
different.

37:19.642 --> 37:21.677
I'm still me.
We're still us.

37:21.744 --> 37:23.645
I'm just...

37:23.713 --> 37:25.180
I now live in a world
where I know

37:25.247 --> 37:27.816
that you're a gladiator first
and a person second.

37:27.884 --> 37:30.585
That's okay.
Because I can do that, too.

37:30.652 --> 37:32.252
I can be a person second.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.922
I just... (Chuckles)

37:34.990 --> 37:36.624
Before, I just didn't know

37:36.692 --> 37:39.026
that's what we were doing
with each other, is all.

37:39.094 --> 37:41.428
We're good.

37:41.496 --> 37:43.030
Abby.

37:44.799 --> 37:46.666
You know what?
I have an idea.

37:46.734 --> 37:48.401
Maybe we're going about this
whole morality thing

37:48.469 --> 37:49.703
the wrong way.

37:49.770 --> 37:52.238
Hmm.

37:52.306 --> 37:53.873
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

37:53.941 --> 37:56.242
(Sighs) - We have nothing on these guys.
- Doesn't matter.

37:56.310 --> 37:57.711
- What if they call our bluff?
- They won't.

37:57.778 --> 37:59.212
- What if they do?
- They won't.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.979
(Man) Gentlemen, let's take
a look at our stock prices...

38:01.047 --> 38:02.482
Don't worry, gentlemen.
We're not here to occupy you.

38:02.549 --> 38:03.583
- Who the hell...
- Relax.

38:03.650 --> 38:05.450
We just need a couple
minutes of your time.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.552
We know you're about to fire
Sarah Stanner

38:07.621 --> 38:10.055
for violating the morality
clause of her contract.

38:10.123 --> 38:11.423
- That's a big decision.
- Huge!

38:11.491 --> 38:13.425
- I'll get security.
- Go ahead, Larry.

38:13.493 --> 38:15.027
It's Larry, right?

38:15.095 --> 38:16.794
Before you have security
set their tasers to stun,

38:16.862 --> 38:19.731
let me just say that in this box
my colleague is holding is dirt.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.365
All the dirt we spent
the past week digging up

38:21.433 --> 38:22.867
on every single one of you.

38:22.935 --> 38:24.836
Dirty dirt. Filthy dirt.
Some of it is illegal,

38:24.903 --> 38:26.470
and some of it's just
downright disgusting.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.840
I'm talking "no amount
of Lysol's gonna clean

38:28.907 --> 38:30.908
that corporate jet" disgusting.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.876
You know what
he's talking about, right?

38:32.944 --> 38:34.545
- Actually, I don't.
- Oh, soon you will.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.547
And so will your families.
So will America.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.715
We wouldn't put a morality
clause in our contracts

38:38.783 --> 38:40.316
if any of us had anything
to worry about.

38:40.384 --> 38:41.818
Well, in that case,
you won't mind

38:41.886 --> 38:43.687
if Abby just opens the box
and starts reading.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.155
Fine by me.

38:45.222 --> 38:46.823
Okay. Let's do this.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.526
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

38:50.593 --> 38:54.030
So, on the count of three,
we'll all get naked together.

38:54.097 --> 38:56.198
Ready? (Projector and
camera shutter clicking)

38:56.266 --> 38:58.500
One...

38:58.568 --> 39:00.202
Two...

39:00.270 --> 39:02.504
Wait.

39:06.509 --> 39:10.145
Ryocorp won't be enforcing
the morality clause.

39:10.213 --> 39:12.181
Turns out the board has
a few secrets of their own.

39:12.248 --> 39:13.748
Your job is safe, Sarah.

39:13.816 --> 39:15.417
That's...
That's good, thanks.

39:24.660 --> 39:28.829
I have the results
of the paternity test.

39:28.897 --> 39:31.666
Go ahead.
Open it.

39:36.004 --> 39:39.439
But whatever's in there
won't make a difference.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.441
It's not going to erase
the 13 years

39:41.509 --> 39:43.109
you've spent as Annie's dad.

39:43.177 --> 39:44.711
It's not going to
make you stay.

39:44.778 --> 39:47.013
It's not going to let you
walk away.

39:47.081 --> 39:48.615
It's not going to change
how you feel about your family

39:48.683 --> 39:50.217
or even about your wife.

39:50.284 --> 39:52.619
It's not going to bring
you peace, Phil.

39:56.889 --> 39:58.390
You've been through more
in the last week

39:58.458 --> 40:01.227
than most families go through
in 20 years.

40:01.294 --> 40:03.195
The two of you have been
through a war.

40:03.263 --> 40:05.030
You have wounds.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.833
And the only thing
that will let that heal

40:07.900 --> 40:09.267
is time.

40:23.949 --> 40:26.016
(Tearing)

40:53.477 --> 40:55.411
Listen.

40:55.479 --> 40:57.247
The sweet sound of silence.

40:57.314 --> 40:58.713
They're on to the next story.

40:58.782 --> 41:00.949
(Man) We're reporting live
from the White House.

41:01.017 --> 41:03.318
In a daring pre-dawn raid,
U.S. special forces

41:03.386 --> 41:05.220
have freed American hostages
held in Kashfar...

41:05.288 --> 41:06.889
The operation a model
of precision,

41:06.956 --> 41:09.091
with no casualties
among the hostages

41:09.159 --> 41:10.725
and all four of their captors
dead...

41:10.794 --> 41:12.060
In contrast
to the previous attempt,

41:12.128 --> 41:13.495
this mission is being termed

41:13.562 --> 41:14.962
a complete and resounding
success,

41:15.030 --> 41:17.399
<i>and has provided</i>
<i>a much-needed confidence boost</i>

41:17.466 --> 41:18.933
<i>to the Grant administration</i>
<i>tonight</i>

41:19.001 --> 41:21.336
<i>after several weeks</i>
<i>of political embarrassments.</i>

41:21.404 --> 41:24.005
<i>Until this evening, the hostage</i>
<i>situation in Kashfar...</i> (Turns tv off)

41:24.072 --> 41:25.973
Did you come here to gloat?

41:26.041 --> 41:28.410
Why would I? Looks like
the mission went perfectly.

41:28.477 --> 41:30.011
It did.

41:30.078 --> 41:31.712
But I had nothing
to do with it.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.648
Didn't even hear about it
until it was already under way.

41:34.716 --> 41:36.883
I thought I was back,
but I was wrong.

41:36.951 --> 41:38.285
Welcome to Siberia.

41:38.353 --> 41:40.086
(Sighs)

41:40.154 --> 41:42.356
(Inhales sharply)
Turns out I was wrong, too.

41:42.424 --> 41:44.391
Oh, yeah? How so?

41:44.459 --> 41:46.694
He's not cheating on me, Cy.

41:46.761 --> 41:48.761
He's cheating on <i>you.</i>

41:52.066 --> 41:55.068
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

41:55.136 --> 41:56.903
Oh, my God.

41:56.971 --> 41:59.272
The hostages are free.
What happened to you?

41:59.340 --> 42:01.674
I got mugged.
Did you hear me? They're free.

42:04.945 --> 42:06.778
I'll get you some ice.

42:26.465 --> 42:29.667
(Cell phone rings)

42:29.735 --> 42:31.402
(Beep) Did you send it?

42:31.470 --> 42:33.838
Just now.
I'll take a look.

42:33.906 --> 42:35.573
Thanks.
(Beep)
