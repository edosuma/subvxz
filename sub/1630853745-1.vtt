WEBVTT

00:10.093 --> 00:11.094
[cannon fires]

00:11.136 --> 00:12.846
[bleep]

00:12.887 --> 00:14.347
That goes off every day.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.307
It gives me a heart attack.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.520
This is my first time
ever in Malta.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.647
This season for me,
it’s a new place,

00:22.689 --> 00:25.984
a new boat,
with new department heads.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.902
-Oh!
-Oh, no!

00:27.944 --> 00:29.529
You gotta manage
this deck, okay?

00:29.571 --> 00:30.864
I don’t wanna be the bosun.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.198
Challenge accepted.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.867
-Welcome.
-Hello, guys! Hi.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.870
Our goal is to make this
your home away from home.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.998
Woo!

00:40.040 --> 00:42.000
Déjà vu.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.209
Oh, my God.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.419
I want this uniform
to work, please.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.712
Should we get naked first?

00:45.754 --> 00:47.714
I was this ----ing
close to her vagina.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.382
I was just, like, okay.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.551
As a chief stew,
when sh-- hits the fan,

00:51.593 --> 00:55.221
the best thing to do
is feed them alcohol.

00:55.263 --> 00:58.558
Happy birthday!
Woohoo!

00:58.600 --> 01:01.061
Is this my sister?
Is this my twin?

01:01.102 --> 01:02.645
We’re like twins, almost.

01:02.687 --> 01:06.024
Bring me a naked man,
and bring him to me now.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.400
-Oh, my God.
-Wow.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.861
I love pressure,
thrive under pressure.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.945
Absolutely love it.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.489
Look what our deckhand brought.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.907
Woo!

01:13.948 --> 01:16.076
We’re gonna drink!

01:16.117 --> 01:17.160
Where’s Raygan?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.454
She’s dancing her butt off.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.500
I am not openly looking
for a boat romance,

01:23.541 --> 01:27.253
but Storm is looking
nice at this point.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.256
I’ve never had flings
with guests before.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.134
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

01:35.053 --> 01:36.638
We’re not!

01:36.680 --> 01:38.348
Bullsh--, babe.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.349
No, we’re not dating.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.934
What’s going on here?

01:40.975 --> 01:44.312
The chief stew and the chef
have to work well together.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.730
It permeates through the boat.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.357
-One second.
-No, don’t touch me.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.858
You’re second stew,
I’m a second stew.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.318
You are also responsible.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.945
Three meters, getting close.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.446
That is not three meters.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.948
One meter... she’s gonna hit it,
man.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.199
We’re gonna hit, we’re gonna
hit.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.283
Oh sh--.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.786
Hit ahead, hit ahead.

01:59.828 --> 02:04.124
I’ve never hit anything
in my career, ever.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.542
[bleep]

02:05.583 --> 02:06.918
I’m not driving with
you guys as a team.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.378
It sounds like you
don’t wanna be here.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.629
That’s literally
what I’m saying.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.006
Look, I think you should go now.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.465
She can deal with you.
Look at your attitude.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.967
You’ve been abusing
me for so long,

02:14.009 --> 02:15.135
and I’ve held it.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.219
Okay. Well, I’m off.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.846
Oh sh--.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.306
-All crew, all crew, hang on.
-[alarm blares]

02:20.348 --> 02:24.102
Hold everything, hold... oh!

02:24.144 --> 02:27.230
Are we crashing?
What’s happening?

02:27.272 --> 02:28.648
Oh! I twisted my ankle.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.734
Oh sh--.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.862
Oh, my God,
we are so ----ed.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.864
----ing hell!

03:08.229 --> 03:09.522
Beautiful.

03:09.564 --> 03:13.610
Malta is a small country
off the coast of Sicily.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.236
It has so many
different influences...

03:15.278 --> 03:17.447
Arabic, Italian, Spanish.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.240
It’s a little piece
of paradise

03:19.282 --> 03:22.744
that hasn’t been discovered
by the superyacht industry.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.584
Oh, my gosh, this boat.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.044
Ooh!

03:31.086 --> 03:33.588
Futuristic.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.801
The galley, the wheelhouse.

03:37.842 --> 03:38.802
Hi, welcome.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.595
Oh, my gosh, hello,
how are you?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.263
I’m okay, good, how are you?

03:42.305 --> 03:44.391
-I’m Natasha, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, welcome.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.725
Oh, thank you.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.103
I love that you have
a lot of experience.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.480
Ah, oh, you’ve seen my CV.

03:50.522 --> 03:51.898
Yeah, so you’re good, like,

03:51.940 --> 03:54.234
managing the personalities
and the meltdowns?

03:54.275 --> 03:55.652
Yeah.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.946
I’ve been in yachting
for almost 10 years now.

03:57.987 --> 04:02.075
I’m definitely a lead
by example kinda girl.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.410
That sounds super cringe.

04:03.451 --> 04:06.287
So, these are your stews, okay?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.956
You pick who’s your second.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.250
Since we have five men
and three women on the crew,

04:10.291 --> 04:12.252
there will need to
be one coed bunk.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.588
It’s okay with management,
so we’re good there.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.008
So, we have female bosun.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.098
Yeah, that’s good.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.850
-Well, thank you.
-Welcome.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.354
Big boat. It’s amazing.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.647
I really should change.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.649
So new.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.817
I’ll take this cabin.

04:37.736 --> 04:38.945
Hello?

04:38.987 --> 04:41.740
-Hi!
-Hi, I’m Raygan.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.324
Welcome aboard.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.036
You know, honestly, it’s always
nice to have women on deck.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.495
-I think it’s...
-I know.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.666
Yeah. These are your deck crew.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.752
It would have been great
to have Malia back,

04:53.793 --> 04:55.920
but right now she’s chief
officer on another vessel.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.298
To be able to give
this opportunity to

04:58.340 --> 05:00.342
the female on deck
is incredible,

05:00.383 --> 05:01.968
because someone gave
me the opportunity.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.137
So, I wanna be able
to extend that forward.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.389
-Welcome aboard. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.599
Okay.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.643
Ah, it’s Dave.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.814
Oh.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.112
Hello?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.822
Home sweet home.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.117
-Ah!
-Oh, what the [bleep]!

05:26.159 --> 05:27.494
All right!

05:27.535 --> 05:28.828
-Are you all right?
-How you doing?

05:28.870 --> 05:31.373
-Nice to see you.
-What’s going on?

05:33.249 --> 05:34.626
Did I scare you?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.670
Yeah, I was so scared.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.672
Just did a month charter
with Natasha.

05:38.713 --> 05:42.133
We’re good friends.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.176
Pretty busy.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.636
Buzzing.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.013
She’s good at her job,
she’s super cool.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.561
Yeah.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.771
How many bags did you have?

05:54.813 --> 05:56.398
Just two.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.154
Well, welcome.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.823
See what there is around.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.076
-Lovely.
-Hello?

06:09.744 --> 06:10.704
It’s so light!

06:10.745 --> 06:13.289
I wanna stay here.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.457
-Hi.
-Dave.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.709
-Dave, nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.377
-Welcome.
-Just bumped into Tash.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.628
So, you guys worked together?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.380
We just recently
worked together, yeah.

06:20.422 --> 06:24.759
-Yeah, she sang your praise.
-Well, she’s pretty good, too.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.886
I’ve worked on yachts
for eight years.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.555
I was a yacht chef
before I had

06:28.596 --> 06:30.807
my own restaurant in
the southwest of France.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.976
Super proud of it,
but it’s super difficult

06:33.018 --> 06:34.769
to make a success of it.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.271
Hey, you’re impressive,
with your gold medal.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.522
I don’t have it anymore.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.732
I should have brought
it with me.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.275
Yeah.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.403
I won British ski championships
in freestyle skiing in 2014.

06:43.445 --> 06:46.239
A little skydiving,
climbed Everest.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.617
I’ve cheated death so
many times, it’s a joke.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.163
-Thank you so much.
-All right, welcome aboard.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.790
-I’m looking for the bosun.
-Hi, I’m here.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.208
-You’re the bosun?
-Yeah, I am, yeah.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.085
-Hi, Bosun.
-Hi there. What’s your name?

06:59.127 --> 07:00.670
-Jason
-Jason, Jason. Hi, how are you?

07:00.712 --> 07:02.297
I’m one of your deckhands.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.049
Oh, great, you’re nice
and tall, so that’s good.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.801
Yeah. So, I will go change
into this, I’m assuming?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.011
Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.847
So, just one of these two.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.140
All right, I’ll just go
with this one, then.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.600
-Go for it.
-Quite spacious.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.934
Oh, my God, I love your toes.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.853
-Thanks, man.
-That’s epic.

07:16.895 --> 07:21.649
[bleep]

07:21.691 --> 07:23.568
-Hi, how are you?
-Hi, I’m Tasha.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.320
Natalya, nice to meet you.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.780
I’m so excited.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.908
Is this, like, my sister?
Is this my twin, like...

07:29.949 --> 07:32.494
We’re like twins,
almost, yeah.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.289
-You ready?
-I’m ready. New season.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.792
Oh sh--.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.339
-Welcome back to the Med.
-Thank you!

07:44.381 --> 07:45.507
Ugh!

07:45.548 --> 07:48.343
Holy sh--,
this thing is heavy.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.552
Oh, the crew mess.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.221
It’s nice, hey?

07:51.262 --> 07:54.474
I can’t be looking this Goddamn
good and carry this big-ass bag.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.850
How long you been doing this?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.478
I’ve been yachting for,
like, over 12 years now.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.563
Is that a Canadian accent?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.693
Yeah, oh.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.697
I was born in Essex, and
I moved from England

08:08.738 --> 08:11.282
to Turkey when I was 12
because my parents

08:13.284 --> 08:14.536
How long you been in Turkey?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.079
I’ve been in Turkey
for 17 years.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.747
Being in Turkey, I’ve calmed
down a little bit,

08:17.789 --> 08:21.042
because, obviously,
it’s a Muslim country.

08:25.714 --> 08:28.550
-So, where are you from?
-Indiana.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.136
Yeah, okay.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.389
Two more left.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.682
Damn, this is classy.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.519
-Hello?
-What?

08:39.561 --> 08:43.606
This is happening.
Hi... hey!

08:43.648 --> 08:45.025
Hi, I’m Tasha, nice to meet you.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.526
Damn, girl, like, one more look.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.361
You look hella...

08:48.403 --> 08:49.946
-I’m so excited to be a stew.
-You look so good, yeah.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.573
-Hi, Natalya.
-Hi, Natalya.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.660
-Oh, fantastic.
-So, we’re a team... dream team.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.663
-Already happening.
-Yes.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.206
Port aft.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.084
-They’re quite spacious.
-No, they’re not bad, eh?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.961
[phone ringing]

09:05.003 --> 09:05.879
Hi, Mzi!

09:05.920 --> 09:07.130
Hey, Captain Sandy, how are you?

09:07.172 --> 09:08.965
It’s so good to see your face.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.596
You know, I saw a lot of
potential and growth in Mzi.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.764
You got it, Mzi.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.099
Nice work.
Anchor down.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.604
To bring him back and
to watch him flourish

09:22.645 --> 09:25.231
will be an
incredible feeling.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.193
Thanks for referring
your friend Storm, too.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.528
Okay, yeah.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.113
So, talk to me,
what’s going on?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.751
Do you know what time tomorrow
you’ll be released?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.339
[bleep]

09:49.381 --> 09:50.924
All right, you’ll come
join us by tender.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.635
-Yeah.
-Okay. Awesome. All right.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.597
Well, that’s a bummer.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.265
-So, the cabin situation...
-Sure.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.893
...there’s an uneven amount
of guys and girls.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.854
The chef, Dave, or
one of the deckhands,

10:04.896 --> 10:07.899
would share a cabin
with one of us.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.323
Yeah, why not?

10:18.743 --> 10:22.414
I don’t care who I share with.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.456
Forward?

10:23.498 --> 10:24.916
Yeah.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.711
-We’re roomies?
-We’re roomies.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.716
I already know Dave,
we’re really good mates.

10:32.757 --> 10:36.302
So, rather that than share
with someone I don’t know,

10:36.344 --> 10:39.389
and then potentially not
get along with them.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.350
And I feel like
it’s easier now, hopefully.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.648
It’s cool.

10:48.690 --> 10:52.235
[bleep] I don’t know
what to say.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.571
Oh, so you’re sharing a cabin?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.197
Hey?

10:59.034 --> 11:01.244
Or shared cabin experiences.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.079
Oh, Kyle.

11:03.121 --> 11:07.876
All crew, all crew, meet me in
the main salon for our welcome.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.174
The cool thing about
motor yacht Home, it’s a hybrid.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.012
It’s really futuristic looking.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.890
Everything’s white,
stainless, ultra-modern.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.100
First boat like this
I’ve ever run.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.520
Okay. Welcome, everyone.

11:27.562 --> 11:30.940
We have two crewmembers that
are still in quarantine

11:30.982 --> 11:33.193
until tomorrow,
probably around 9:00,

11:33.234 --> 11:36.529
and it’s gonna be challenging,

11:36.571 --> 11:38.990
because the reality is we
pick up charter tomorrow.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.826
And the turnaround time,
the provisioning,

11:41.868 --> 11:45.455
the cleaning the vessel,

11:45.497 --> 11:47.123
it’s a disaster.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.878
Coming up...

11:51.920 --> 11:55.048
----ing hell! Oh, my God.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.050
Are we crashing?
What’s happening?

12:08.436 --> 12:09.688
We have two crewmembers
that are still in quarantine

12:11.189 --> 12:13.608
until tomorrow,
probably around 9:00.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.568
It’s gonna be challenging,

12:15.610 --> 12:18.238
because the reality is we pick
up charter tomorrow.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.574
And provisioning,
the cleaning the vessel...

12:21.616 --> 12:23.368
it’s a disaster.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.452
We have 24 hours.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.954
There’s teaks
that need cleaning,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.581
there’s chrome
that needs shining.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.375
Not having two deckhands,

12:30.417 --> 12:33.378
just being me and
Jason, this is bad.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.465
I like to run a
boat where we help each other,

12:37.507 --> 12:39.467
so I’m there for you.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.970
I got a floor thing...
I don’t wanna see dirty floors.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.222
The deck is responsible
for the crew mess.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.016
And, you know, we’re adults.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.517
I expect you to act like that.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.603
So, hate comments...
I won’t tolerate it.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.398
Sexual harassment,
I will not tolerate it.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.278
If you fall in love, that’s
not sexual harassment, right?

12:58.319 --> 13:02.073
So, now I wanted to introduce
our chief officer, Ray.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.784
-Hi, Ray.
-And Carlos, the chief engineer.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.661
-Hello, Carlos.
-Thank you so much.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.455
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.166
It’s been a while since I’ve
had all new department heads.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.043
The chain that
is wrapped around the anchor,

13:13.084 --> 13:14.836
I would have dropped that first.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.504
I didn’t like the way you’re
speaking to everyone, you know?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.173
I just give the guests
what they ask for

13:18.214 --> 13:19.507
on their preference sheets.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.343
What’s that,
a resting bitch face?

13:21.384 --> 13:22.469
Ooh, Adam.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.137
How are they gonna
handle the pressure?

13:24.179 --> 13:25.972
Can they lead?
It’s critical.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.850
You’re in charge of lives,
you’re in charge of hospitality.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.770
There’s no room for error.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.564
Let’s just get started,
then, shall we?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.399
Can we have an interior meeting?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.568
Sounds great.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.153
So, just maybe a wipe-down?

13:40.195 --> 13:42.530
Yeah. Be right back.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.408
Yeah.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.037
[lighter clicks]

13:59.798 --> 14:04.302
I’ve worked on boats
right up until 107 meters.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.054
I had 10 stews under me.

14:06.096 --> 14:10.433
Me, in the past, I’ve worked
for people who’d be screaming,

14:10.475 --> 14:11.810
swearing at me,

14:11.851 --> 14:14.646
and I don’t like to
be surrounded by negativity.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.232
When my mum and dad got
divorced when I was six,

14:17.273 --> 14:19.567
I felt like I was
a bit of a peacemaker.

14:19.609 --> 14:23.238
So, it’s important that I keep
feeling the happiness around.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.990
I’d like to think I’m
an approachable person.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.159
Jason, how you doing?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.705
Obviously, I’ve seen your CVs.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.164
To me, at the moment,
I don’t think

14:33.206 --> 14:34.541
there’s any need for a rank,

14:34.582 --> 14:37.252
because you’re both
very experienced.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.588
Yeah, honestly, I feel like
I do deserve my rank.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.382
Um...

14:42.424 --> 14:45.760
Going on four years
now of chief stew, so...

14:45.802 --> 14:49.097
-So, what are your thoughts?
-...we can be joint second.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.390
So, that’s where it is.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.641
Ain’t nobody winging
one bar here.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.268
I’m a service queen
from the get-go.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.688
So, extreme personality,
extreme service.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.608
I have exactly 18 cousins that
I grew up with, you know?

15:00.650 --> 15:03.111
I had to stand out, like,
hello, can you hear me?

15:03.153 --> 15:05.780
And I think we
just rotate duties.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.657
So maybe for this trip, Kyle,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.075
do you wanna be on service
for this one, and do,

15:09.117 --> 15:11.453
like, the late
shift, and then...

15:11.494 --> 15:13.204
-Fantastic.
-Housekeeping, laundry?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.081
You wanna be in housekeeping,
laundry, and then just

15:15.123 --> 15:16.124
-chip in where you need?
-Yeah.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.835
All crew, all crew.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.712
-There it is.
-Sh--.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.466
You guys, you wanna
do, like, a train?

15:27.177 --> 15:28.345
Oh, my God!

15:28.386 --> 15:29.596
Really?

15:29.637 --> 15:31.514
This is the most meat
I’ve ever handled.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.724
Oh, boy.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.228
Galley Tetris.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.360
Ugh! Ah! Oh!

15:43.401 --> 15:45.111
These are Sandy’s.

15:47.906 --> 15:52.660
Mega-yachts are a little
different than what I’m used to.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.371
Yeah, like, up to 35 feet.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.082
Most people’s perception of me
without knowing me is incorrect.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.251
Growing up in Indiana, I went to
Purdue in the middle of nowhere.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.879
After college,
I got into commodity trading

16:02.921 --> 16:04.506
for about 11 years.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.132
After that company
got bought out,

16:06.174 --> 16:09.010
I felt like a divorcee
and a new lease on life.

16:09.052 --> 16:12.055
I sold all my stuff
and flew overseas.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.432
I started painting my nails
probably a couple of years ago.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.184
I grew my hair out on a bet.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.854
It’s ridiculous,
as you can see it.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.357
But I’m one of the wild cards,
for sure.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.984
Okay, so, I’m gonna
blade it all down.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.611
Please fit.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.946
[bleep]

16:27.987 --> 16:30.699
Dave, Natasha, and Raygan,

16:30.740 --> 16:34.536
meet me in the crew mess for our
first preference sheet meeting.

16:34.577 --> 16:35.704
Copy.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.288
-Copy.
-Copy.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.668
This is our first charter,
which is very exciting.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.837
Billy Rodriguez is a
prestigious president

16:43.878 --> 16:47.215
and cofounder of a Los Angeles
based advertising agency.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.926
He and his fiancé and
co-primary, Chris Figueroa,

16:49.968 --> 16:51.594
met in Japan and
will be celebrating

16:51.636 --> 16:53.346
their anniversary
during their stay.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.681
Aw.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.850
In addition to enjoying
a Japanese-themed evening,

16:56.891 --> 17:00.603
these guests would also like to
invite a local drag performer...

17:00.645 --> 17:02.647
-Oh, yes!
-Oh, that’s pretty fun.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.816
...for an all-out drag
night while on charter.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.736
They expect to use all
available water toys.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.572
Here’s the bummer...
the slide’s held up in customs,

17:10.613 --> 17:14.284
so you will need to pull
out all stops on deck,

17:14.325 --> 17:16.244
every available opportunity.

17:16.286 --> 17:19.539
Lots of seafood,
lots of lobster.

17:19.581 --> 17:21.875
Beets... "they taste like dirt."

17:21.916 --> 17:23.335
Can’t beet a root.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.420
That’s funny.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.005
Our first charter
together, and...

17:27.047 --> 17:28.465
-Yeah.
-...hopefully, we kill it.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.176
Since our crewmembers
are still in quarantine,

17:31.217 --> 17:33.094
so I’m gonna have
Ray back there with you.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.846
And then Carlos is gonna
be on the bow

17:34.888 --> 17:36.222
to help us get off the dock.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.682
Yeah, yeah, of course.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.268
Getting off the dock,
being down two deckhands,

17:40.310 --> 17:41.603
it’s a safety issue.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.480
These dolphins are
really close together.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.440
They’re steel, you wanna make
sure you don’t hit them.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.317
So, I have the chief officer

17:47.359 --> 17:50.362
calling the distances because
deck needs that support.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.654
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.578
Seeing as you guys
got the cabins,

17:58.620 --> 18:00.914
you want me to go start on
all the foodie stuff?

18:00.955 --> 18:01.915
Yeah.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.041
Can I show you something?

18:03.083 --> 18:05.293
Just go really fast.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.132
Great.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.176
Next cabin, here we go.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.391
This actually is a workout,
like, spraying these bottles.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.935
You are so disgusting,
but I like it.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.520
I was recently just working in

18:23.561 --> 18:27.399
the Kimberlys in Australia
as a sole stew.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.192
It’s very lonely.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.152
You take on every single
department...

18:31.194 --> 18:34.030
service, laundry, nannying.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.657
I was in the kitchen.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.659
So, coming onto a
boat where there’s,

18:37.701 --> 18:42.455
like, eight crew, I’m, like,
super excited about it.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.957
I’m going to bed.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.544
Is that us finished another one?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.629
The cabins are completely done.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.007
We need to get to bed.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.049
I’m losing my mind for real.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.968
-Okay, bye.
-Love you guys.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.553
You, too.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.056
Shifting stuff around.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.599
You’ll be all right.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.518
-Oh, my God.
-No, you’re fine.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.021
It’s always gonna be that...
it’s the first couple of days.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.356
Tomorrow’s another day, and
you get to some sleep today.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.317
-We’ll smash it out tomorrow.
-So hard.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.902
You’ll be all right.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.320
[snoring]

19:18.241 --> 19:20.035
Mm?

19:20.076 --> 19:21.286
Good night.

19:22.746 --> 19:23.997
Ah.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.258
[alarm sounds]

19:41.848 --> 19:43.016
[alarm sounds]

19:44.100 --> 19:45.769
Ow!

19:50.774 --> 19:53.610
-Oh, Lord.
-Here you go.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.028
Thanks.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.322
Holy sh--, look at this galley.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.532
He’s incredible.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.368
-Should we get started?
-I’m ready to go.

20:07.665 --> 20:08.416
Oh my God!

20:08.458 --> 20:09.751
Is this love?

20:09.793 --> 20:11.961
Is this the start
of an early romance?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.924
How long did
you work together for?

20:15.965 --> 20:16.925
Just a month.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.344
We were just, like...

20:20.387 --> 20:22.430
We were like the
little Musketeers.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.724
I’ve just been
through a break-up

20:24.766 --> 20:26.643
right before
coming on this boat.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.311
So, I’m focusing on me.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.438
I’m not worrying
about someone else.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.318
Let’s just start carrying this
stuff out of the main salon.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.993
Thanks for working so hard.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.704
Oh, of course,
that’s what we’re here for.

20:46.788 --> 20:47.997
[yawns]

20:49.332 --> 20:50.709
Another delivery for you.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.002
It looks light.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.715
-What is it?
-I don’t know.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.966
It’s a floating dock.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.467
That goes under your
bosun’s...

21:06.307 --> 21:07.976
[bleep]

21:10.437 --> 21:12.480
Okay, well [bleep].

21:12.522 --> 21:13.898
I’ll be back in two minutes.

21:15.859 --> 21:20.196
I think all the door handles
are gonna need work as well.

21:20.238 --> 21:23.742
Ah... oh.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.994
Look at this kid,
all by himself.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.996
Where’s the bosun?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.459
All right, I’m helping you.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.918
You carried this by yourself?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.546
-Yeah.
-Man, you’re strong.

21:39.549 --> 21:42.594
-Did you tuck?
-So, yeah.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.095
What do you mean? It’s all out.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.723
-All jokes aside...
-Yeah.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.350
...I came out last year, March.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.517
No, you didn’t!

21:49.559 --> 21:51.019
Bible. I’m being serious.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.896
In South Africa, it’s not
really a popular thing,

21:52.937 --> 21:56.608
to be homosexual, and especially
going to an all-boys’ school.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.652
I always had to hide away
who I was, being gay.

21:59.694 --> 22:03.823
The longest relationship
I’ve had was 12 years.

22:03.865 --> 22:05.658
It was always kept a secret,

22:05.700 --> 22:08.661
and keeping that all
inside damaged me a lot.

22:08.703 --> 22:11.915
But I’d like to make humor
out of a situation

22:11.956 --> 22:14.876
that’s uncomfortable,
and through that humor,

22:14.918 --> 22:17.379
I attract people more
to my personality

22:17.420 --> 22:19.214
and make them forget,
you know what,

22:19.255 --> 22:22.258
don’t look at him as the
gay guy in front of me.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.177
I see a funny guy
in front of me.

22:24.219 --> 22:28.056
So, I’m nearly 30, and
I really wanna have kids.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.599
I really wanna get
married one day.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.518
-Yeah.
-Obviously, no rush on that.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.144
Do you want me to put
the condoms on your bed?

22:33.186 --> 22:34.521
Safety first.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.107
Is it an arrival cocktail?

22:37.148 --> 22:40.860
It’s a blue raspberry shot,
with a Jolly Rancher in it.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.279
I’ve always been massive
into doing courses.

22:43.321 --> 22:48.576
I’ve done language courses,
floristry, beauty, bartending.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.120
Learning how to flair.

22:50.161 --> 22:53.081
I tried to do flair in a boat
and I dropped the bottle

22:53.123 --> 22:55.375
on the floor and
it smashed everywhere.

22:55.417 --> 22:59.170
So, ever since then,
I never attempt it on a boat.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.632
Yeah, I’ve got
my blue vibe going on.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.303
Quick, what are we doing?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.848
We’re gonna move the upstairs
provisions to a hallway.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.976
We need to get these boxes
out of sight of the guests.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.854
Guys, this is ----ing insane,
and I’m overwhelmed.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.480
So it’s a matter of the case
is where you find a hole,

23:17.522 --> 23:20.483
fill it with something,
you know?

23:25.321 --> 23:27.032
All crew, all crew,
in your whites.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.159
Guest arrival at 12:00.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.160
Time to get dressed.

23:33.329 --> 23:37.000
Lord, have mercy on my soul.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.085
So, if I walk through the boat
it’s gonna be fine, right?

23:39.127 --> 23:40.670
I’m hoping to God.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.630
Okay, ready for the charter.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.007
Good job.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.511
All crew, all crew,
the guests are arriving.

23:48.553 --> 23:49.596
Meet on the dock.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.014
Lord, have mercy.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.641
And then we need, like,
a little plate.

24:11.284 --> 24:11.493
Ah!

24:13.453 --> 24:16.039
Shots, shots, shots.

24:16.081 --> 24:18.792
-Hi, everyone.
-Welcome! Hi!

24:18.833 --> 24:20.377
How are you, I’m your captain.

24:20.418 --> 24:22.128
-Nice to meet you.
-Chris.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.171
Welcome aboard.

24:23.213 --> 24:25.965
Hi, I’m Raygan,
nice to meet you.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.760
-That dress, I love it!
-Thank you!

24:28.802 --> 24:30.553
Thank you, I’m Kyle,
nice to meet you.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.263
Welcome to Motor Yacht Home.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.890
Thank you.

24:33.932 --> 24:36.059
So, our goal is to make it your
home and the best holiday ever.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.018
Perfect.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.895
We’re gonna get off the dock and

24:38.937 --> 24:40.230
we’re gonna head out as soon
as we get your luggage on board.

24:40.271 --> 24:42.941
Natasha is gonna
show you around the boat.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.567
-Hello!
-Wonderful, thank you.

24:44.609 --> 24:48.154
So, if we can invite you to
place your shoes in this basket.

24:48.196 --> 24:48.947
Oh, sure.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.365
Let’s get the luggage.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.617
We have some blue
Jolly Rancher shots here.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.203
Yeah!

24:55.245 --> 24:56.663
It’s quite heavy.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.331
Oh, mother----er.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.374
Just to let you know.

24:59.416 --> 25:02.711
-Cheers.
-Yes!

25:02.752 --> 25:04.087
That was good.

25:06.464 --> 25:07.757
Champagne?

25:07.799 --> 25:09.134
I’m definitely
starting with that.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.302
So, would you like
to commence the tour?

25:11.344 --> 25:12.721
Yes!

25:14.347 --> 25:16.016
So, this is bridge deck aft,

25:16.057 --> 25:17.851
where you’ll probably
have most of your meals.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.352
Can you grab this one?

25:19.394 --> 25:22.439
Oh, my God.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.357
We have the sundeck,

25:24.399 --> 25:26.151
and the Jacuzzi.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.944
This is what
I’m super excited about.

25:27.986 --> 25:30.780
Lots of alcohol as well.

25:30.822 --> 25:32.991
What are you trying to suggest?

25:37.537 --> 25:38.747
Here, we have
the main salon.

25:38.788 --> 25:39.998
Nice.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.332
There’s one suitcase left.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.209
I can’t carry that,
it’s too heavy.

25:44.753 --> 25:46.463
----ing hell.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.464
This is your team.

25:47.505 --> 25:52.719
Like, you... like, help.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.179
Oh, my ----ing God.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.972
So, now we can go
and see the cabins.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.141
Don’t we need to jump on
the beds in your room, Billy?

25:58.183 --> 25:59.392
Yeah.

25:59.434 --> 26:01.061
Oh, those are gonna get
enough action already.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.103
[laughing]

26:02.145 --> 26:03.480
-Wait, is this the master?
-Yeah.

26:03.521 --> 26:04.647
See, it’s very luminous.

26:04.689 --> 26:07.817
-Yes.
-I guess it’ll do.

26:07.859 --> 26:09.486
So, this is the VIP suite.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.987
-Ooh!
-Oh.

26:11.029 --> 26:12.822
And then the other cabins
are kind of very similar.

26:12.864 --> 26:15.825
Captain, Captain, Raygan,
all luggage on board.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.494
I’m getting the passerelle in.

26:17.535 --> 26:18.787
Thank you. Nice work.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.413
It’s 1:15 at the moment.

26:20.455 --> 26:22.832
Is there any particular time
you’d like to have lunch?

26:22.874 --> 26:24.417
Three... 3:00.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.461
You’re gonna have a
fabulous Italian lunch.

26:26.503 --> 26:27.504
-Yay!
-Thank you.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.505
So, yeah.

26:28.546 --> 26:29.673
Where’s it going?

26:29.714 --> 26:31.716
[chattering]

26:31.758 --> 26:32.842
Ah, that wind.

26:32.884 --> 26:34.678
We need to change into our polo.

26:34.719 --> 26:36.638
We’re ready to depart.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.473
Destination is Amir bay.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.520
You could let
go of the bowlines,

26:43.561 --> 26:45.522
start freeing up
the stern lines.

26:45.563 --> 26:46.940
-Natalya.
-Yes?

26:46.981 --> 26:47.941
-Natasha.
-It’s so confusing.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.442
And you guys look alike.

26:49.484 --> 26:51.403
You’re gorgeous brunettes,
and Natalya and Natasha.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.779
-We’re like the twins.
-And, like...

26:52.821 --> 26:54.364
-Yay!
-...it’s not fair.

26:54.406 --> 26:58.201
All crew, all crew,
we have permission to depart.

26:58.243 --> 26:59.703
Quick, quick, quick,
because we...

26:59.744 --> 27:00.912
Oh, quick.

27:00.954 --> 27:02.539
The stern lines are
ready to let go.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.374
Okay, hold it there.

27:04.416 --> 27:06.543
In this marina,
the current really

27:06.584 --> 27:08.044
pushes the vessel to starboard.

27:08.086 --> 27:10.046
Very good, very good.

27:10.088 --> 27:11.506
Guys, we’re off the dock.

27:14.092 --> 27:15.844
And these dolphins,
unlike last season,

27:15.885 --> 27:17.554
they don’t pull them
apart for me.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.014
They’re really close together.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.390
I mean, they’re really
close together.

27:20.432 --> 27:23.059
Raygan, just watch that
buoy on the port side.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.770
It’s coming down now,
eight meters and holding.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.106
We can steer to port.

27:28.148 --> 27:30.358
Eight meters and holding,
very good.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.784
Amazing, thank you.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.536
-Slow and easy wins the race.
-Yeah.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.043
It’s pretty cool,
coming though that.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.211
Awesome, actually.

27:50.253 --> 27:51.796
[chattering]

27:51.838 --> 27:54.883
Why am I waiting in a line to
take a picture with my fiancé?

27:54.924 --> 27:57.510
So, we’re doing this
super starter,

27:57.552 --> 27:59.262
bread, a few
different types.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.598
I will follow
a preference sheet,

28:01.639 --> 28:03.933
but I don’t follow recipes.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.935
If I’m creating, I know
that I need sour,

28:05.977 --> 28:09.105
bitter, sweet,
texture, and earth.

28:09.147 --> 28:10.774
I’m always
bouncing ideas myself,

28:10.815 --> 28:13.943
and it’s almost like just
throwing a ball against a wall.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.028
It’s like, right, can
I do this?

28:15.070 --> 28:16.654
Catch it... yes, I can do that.

28:16.696 --> 28:17.947
Can I do that?

28:17.989 --> 28:19.449
No, I can’t do it,
I’ve dropped it.

28:19.491 --> 28:21.242
Just shut my eyes, and
I can envision the plate.

28:23.995 --> 28:26.289
This one’s empty, completely.

28:26.331 --> 28:29.876
I guess I’ll just wait for
everyone else to get theirs.

28:29.918 --> 28:31.044
-I’m totally kidding.
-Sorry.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.879
I mean, kinda serious.

28:38.468 --> 28:39.678
No?

28:39.719 --> 28:41.096
Yeah, I would do it,
but I’ve been lifting

28:41.137 --> 28:43.181
a little more
than everyone else.

28:46.518 --> 28:47.644
I’ll act like
you didn’t say that.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.354
They’re amazing.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.856
I’ve tried to bite my tongue
while I’m busting my butt.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.566
I stand by my work ethic,

28:53.608 --> 28:57.112
and it’s just easier to just
take it on the chin, say "Copy."

28:57.153 --> 28:59.489
Okay, so I’ll meet you
in the crew mess.

28:59.531 --> 29:02.325
All crew, all crew,
our ETA is 30 minutes.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.121
Oh, hey, how cute.

29:06.162 --> 29:08.373
Can we just look at the
birds’ nests for a second?

29:10.625 --> 29:12.210
Thank God we have Natasha.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.256
Oh, I passed the hunger phase.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.514
I like how you have
all the energy,

29:24.556 --> 29:26.182
now that you’re not
lifting the heavy stuff.

29:26.224 --> 29:28.226
"I can’t lift this bag,
it’s too heavy."

29:28.268 --> 29:30.729
Well, tough sh-- lift it...
well, lift it.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.564
Tough sh--.
Tough sh--, lift it.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.899
You’ll figure it out.

29:43.158 --> 29:44.409
There’s only one of me.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.170
Coming up...

29:55.211 --> 29:56.212
There’s cinnamon.

29:56.254 --> 29:57.964
I’m, like, certain...

29:59.382 --> 30:01.217
The primary would like to
see his preference sheet.

30:01.259 --> 30:02.177
Sure.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.846
He’s had one drink too many.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.354
All crew, our ETA to our
destination is 20 minutes.

30:14.356 --> 30:16.024
Oh!

30:16.066 --> 30:17.525
How are you looking on time?

30:17.567 --> 30:18.777
Yeah, I’m ready.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.779
RPMs, 1600.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.990
So, we have the family-style
buffet of Italian food.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.325
Yay! Ooh.

30:25.367 --> 30:28.703
Could I offer
the wine list for anyone?

30:28.745 --> 30:32.290
-I’m okay.
-Okay.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.459
Set the anchor at the waterline.

30:34.501 --> 30:35.627
Copy.

30:41.216 --> 30:42.759
Anchor is on waterline.

30:42.801 --> 30:46.054
Go to three shackles.

30:46.096 --> 30:48.139
Oh [bleep].

30:53.353 --> 30:55.647
<i>Okay, great.</i>
<i>Do your thing, girl.</i>

30:55.689 --> 30:57.023
Should I go with two?

30:57.065 --> 30:58.108
Yeah, you can take these two.

30:58.149 --> 31:00.527
Yeah?
Looks beautiful.

31:00.568 --> 31:02.070
You look beautiful.

31:02.112 --> 31:03.321
Aw!

31:03.363 --> 31:04.823
I knew there was
a romance going on.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.908
Love is in the air.

31:06.950 --> 31:07.992
No, you look beautiful, too.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.828
Hot soup, coming through.

31:09.869 --> 31:10.995
You look super.

31:11.037 --> 31:14.207
-Ladies first.
-Yum!

31:14.249 --> 31:15.417
Minestrone.
Enjoy.

31:15.458 --> 31:16.876
Thank you.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.170
<i>Natalya, start working around</i>
<i>the cabins, unpacking.</i>

31:19.212 --> 31:20.672
Copy that.

31:20.714 --> 31:22.215
Oh, this is really good.

31:22.257 --> 31:23.425
Is it delicious, babe?

31:23.466 --> 31:26.011
-It’s delicious.
-It’s very good.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.053
[sneezes]

31:27.095 --> 31:28.346
Zoonie!

31:28.388 --> 31:29.764
-It’s very peppery.
-Bless you.

31:32.851 --> 31:34.352
-Beautiful.
-Hey.

31:34.394 --> 31:35.854
The cheese is good.

31:35.895 --> 31:36.938
Bleh.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.231
We have the grilled octopus.

31:38.273 --> 31:41.026
Oh, my goodness, look at that.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.402
Raygan, Raygan,
you’re gonna need

31:42.444 --> 31:43.820
to put the toys in the water.

31:43.862 --> 31:45.488
Get the toys ready, she said.

31:45.530 --> 31:46.948
Okay.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.742
One of the things I think
the crew will find difficult

31:48.783 --> 31:51.202
is all the water toys being
in the hull of the boat.

31:51.244 --> 31:52.620
Everything’s done on the bow.

31:52.662 --> 31:54.539
Just grab all what you can
and bring it to the aft.

31:54.581 --> 31:57.208
The guests don’t have to see
the behind-the-scenes work.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.710
Just like at a resort,

31:58.752 --> 32:01.338
they step outside,
there’s all the water toys.

32:01.379 --> 32:03.923
It’s magic.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.133
[bleep]

32:05.175 --> 32:07.218
I really like
the mozzarella.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.763
How do you eat seafood
without, like, lemon?

32:09.804 --> 32:12.223
That looks absolutely beautiful.

32:12.265 --> 32:14.392
And then I’ve got
some sea bass...

32:14.434 --> 32:15.894
Holy sh--, all right.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.729
...as well, and some linguini.

32:17.771 --> 32:19.606
Dude.

32:21.191 --> 32:24.444
Okay, we have 12-hour-braised
beef cheeks.

32:24.486 --> 32:25.653
Yum.

32:25.695 --> 32:27.989
All right [bleep]
I’m running out of room.

32:28.031 --> 32:29.324
This is so good.

32:29.366 --> 32:32.243
-Mm.
-It is so good.

32:33.912 --> 32:34.954
There’s cinnamon.

32:34.996 --> 32:38.750
I’m, like, 137 percent certain

32:38.792 --> 32:40.460
I put no cinnamon on
my preference sheet.

32:40.502 --> 32:42.462
Are there any of this
without cinnamon?

32:42.504 --> 32:43.838
Well, I can go enquire for you.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.590
Okay. It’s like my
kryptonite, yeah.

32:45.632 --> 32:46.883
Good to know. There’s some
things I need to know.

32:46.925 --> 32:48.510
Well, it was on
the preference sheet, so.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.095
These are things I need to know

32:50.136 --> 32:52.931
next time I read
the preference sheet.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.933
I’m sorry, I’m the bearer
of bad news.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.601
Oh, God.

32:56.643 --> 32:59.771
He’s just asking do we have any
of the beef without cinnamon in.

32:59.813 --> 33:01.398
-Yes.
-Okay.

33:01.439 --> 33:02.857
When have you ever cooked
beef with cinnamon?

33:02.899 --> 33:04.776
Since when do people
don’t like cinnamon?

33:04.818 --> 33:08.697
That’s all guests’ luggage
packed into their cabins.

33:08.738 --> 33:11.366
Can you please pass me
primary’s preference sheet?

33:11.408 --> 33:12.826
So, here we have the arrabbiata.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.161
This is a lot of food
for eight people.

33:15.203 --> 33:16.621
Yeah.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.039
Primary would like to
see his preference sheet.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.374
Sure.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.753
I just wanna make sure
I didn’t say no cinnamon.

33:23.795 --> 33:25.338
On dietary restrictions,
you’ve got none here,

33:25.380 --> 33:26.840
but is that no cinnamon?

33:26.881 --> 33:28.675
Oh, I can’t believe
I did not put that there.

33:28.717 --> 33:31.970
Cinnamon... I can never spell
that... cinnaminaminaminum.

33:32.012 --> 33:34.180
Synonym... cinna-synonym...

33:34.222 --> 33:37.017
I... I cannot pronounce
the word "cinnanym."

33:37.058 --> 33:38.810
I also can’t say "ambulance."

33:38.852 --> 33:41.980
Ambulance, ambulance,
abliance. Ambliance.

33:42.022 --> 33:43.398
I’ve always said "ambliance."

33:43.440 --> 33:46.693
Cinnanynom... see,
I can’t. I can’t.

33:46.735 --> 33:49.320
Okay. Cinnamon-free.

33:49.362 --> 33:51.656
They are very picky, yes.

33:51.698 --> 33:53.742
The first lunch is
super important.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.662
-The cinnamon-free?
-Yes, yes, yes.

33:57.704 --> 33:59.414
-Yeah?
-Here, right here.

33:59.456 --> 34:02.125
There’s no bloody ground
cinnamon on the beef cheek,

34:02.167 --> 34:03.710
it’s just cinnamon sticks.

34:03.752 --> 34:05.378
It’s like an aromatic flavor.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.005
You can’t please everyone,

34:07.047 --> 34:08.965
but I don’t wanna fail, so...

34:09.007 --> 34:10.675
If you don’t like it,
I’m gonna keep going

34:10.717 --> 34:12.677
until you do like it,
basically.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.764
I think it was cooked in the
same thing with the cinnamon.

34:15.805 --> 34:17.515
Sure.

34:17.557 --> 34:19.601
God, everything’s
just crazy, I swear.

34:19.642 --> 34:22.645
I feel like we should be
in the water.

34:22.687 --> 34:24.647
We should all switch
into our swimwear.

34:24.689 --> 34:25.899
-Is it soft?
-Oh, it’s beautiful.

34:25.940 --> 34:26.900
-Yeah?
-Uh-huh.

34:26.941 --> 34:28.193
Holy sh--.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.070
Don’t forget to try
the [bleep] bro.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.071
[laughing]

34:31.112 --> 34:35.283
Ah!

34:35.325 --> 34:36.701
My foot is stuck.

34:36.743 --> 34:38.787
You know what,
why don’t you go

34:38.828 --> 34:41.164
talk to the guests and
see what they wanna do.

34:41.206 --> 34:43.291
Can we play in the water today,
or is that not a thing?

34:43.333 --> 34:44.876
What do they want to do?

34:44.918 --> 34:48.213
Do you have the things that you
can, like, hold onto, and

34:48.254 --> 34:50.006
-Seabob?
-Yeah, that.

34:52.384 --> 34:55.011
No, that sounds like
way too much exercise.

34:55.053 --> 34:56.388
Dude ----ing hell.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.306
I want, like,
Sea-Doos or something.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.391
Pardon?

34:59.432 --> 35:01.184
Like, the little jet-ski things.

35:01.226 --> 35:02.394
It’s a big, massive jet-ski.

35:02.435 --> 35:03.478
Do you think so?

35:03.520 --> 35:05.480
Yeah, yeah, so, I’ll just...

35:07.565 --> 35:09.150
Okay, no problem.

35:09.192 --> 35:11.069
She looked a
little apprehensive.

35:11.111 --> 35:12.696
Who, her?

35:12.737 --> 35:13.738
Yeah, a little.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.281
No, she’s always,
like, make sure.

35:15.323 --> 35:18.702
I don’t know,
I’m not sure she’s my favorite.

35:18.743 --> 35:20.120
[laughing]

35:20.161 --> 35:22.831
We have to ride on the jet-ski
to go to the aft, yeah?

35:26.042 --> 35:27.168
Swimming?

35:27.210 --> 35:28.461
-Yeah.
-Really?

35:28.503 --> 35:30.422
All right, I’ll go change.

35:30.463 --> 35:34.092
-Are you okay?
-Raygan is my enemy now.

35:34.134 --> 35:35.343
I asked a simple question...

35:35.385 --> 35:36.720
Yeah.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.304
...and she’s kinda,
like, stink-face.

35:38.346 --> 35:39.431
Like, I don’t need
stink-face, I just...

35:39.472 --> 35:42.934
The charter guest has had,

35:42.976 --> 35:47.105
one two drink,
five too many at this point.

35:47.147 --> 35:49.607
He’s gonna be
overdramatic about things,

35:49.649 --> 35:51.651
but at the end of the day,
he’s the charter guest.

35:51.693 --> 35:53.236
I’m irritated with her.

35:53.278 --> 35:55.113
Like, don’t be unreasonable.

35:55.155 --> 35:57.824
It must be very hard to get out.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.581
Oh, it’s too much,
nyah, nyah, nyah.

36:04.622 --> 36:05.915
Rightfully so, right?

36:05.957 --> 36:06.791
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.501
-Who’s the bosun?
-Raygan.

36:08.543 --> 36:10.295
That’s it, yeah.

36:10.337 --> 36:14.507
You’re gonna be a stupid bitch
about it, I’m gonna show you.

36:14.549 --> 36:15.967
Treat me like
I’m ----ing stupid.

36:18.094 --> 36:19.304
Coming up...

36:19.346 --> 36:21.514
I believe our deckhands
are arriving.

36:21.556 --> 36:23.391
-Woohoo!
-Captain Sandy.

36:23.433 --> 36:25.352
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

36:25.393 --> 36:26.936
And later...

36:26.978 --> 36:28.980
So, how long have you and
Chef been seeing each other?

36:29.022 --> 36:30.648
I’m not seeing the chef.

36:41.117 --> 36:41.910
There’s nothing in the water.

36:43.578 --> 36:45.038
Like, you’re gonna
be a stupid bitch about it,

36:45.080 --> 36:45.914
I’m gonna show you.

36:45.955 --> 36:48.625
The guest is a bit impatient.

36:48.667 --> 36:51.294
Whatever.
Mad!

36:51.336 --> 36:52.796
I’ll go see him.

36:52.837 --> 36:54.798
-Yeah. Yeah, of course.
-Yeah.

36:54.839 --> 36:57.467
Treat me like
I’m ----ing stupid.

36:57.509 --> 36:58.927
That’s not fun.

36:58.968 --> 37:01.221
So, you push the red
button to get on.

37:01.262 --> 37:04.015
Hi, what’s happening back here?

37:04.057 --> 37:06.851
I... I’m a little
irritated with Raygan.

37:06.893 --> 37:08.228
I know that I’m sounding
like a drama queen.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.521
No, you’re not.

37:09.562 --> 37:10.563
I’m not trying to be
a drama queen.

37:10.605 --> 37:12.023
You’re not. You...

37:12.065 --> 37:13.233
I have... I... on
our preference sheet it says,

37:13.274 --> 37:14.442
"slide out at all times."

37:14.484 --> 37:15.777
Can you show me
where the slide is?

37:15.819 --> 37:17.445
I know. We don’t have one.

37:17.487 --> 37:19.572
Our slide is held in customs.

37:19.614 --> 37:21.908
Oh. Well, there’s that.
So, fine.

37:21.950 --> 37:23.576
So, then, like, make up for it.

37:23.618 --> 37:25.412
Listen, I would be
complaining, too.

37:25.453 --> 37:26.621
I would be pissed.

37:26.663 --> 37:28.581
We left the dock
without two crewmembers,

37:28.623 --> 37:31.084
so the deck team is
really struggling.

37:33.753 --> 37:35.463
I’m, like,
a customer service guy.

37:35.505 --> 37:38.091
It’s not that she’s rude;
she’s not warm and fuzzy.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.092
I’m just, like...

37:39.134 --> 37:40.593
Yeah, I am really sorry,

37:40.635 --> 37:43.263
and you have every right
to sit here and tell me that.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.556
I’ll take care of it.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.975
We’re launching
the WaveRunners now.

37:47.017 --> 37:50.103
But drinking and
WaveRunnering can’t happen.

37:50.145 --> 37:51.479
My crew can take you.

37:51.521 --> 37:53.606
I’m ready with this.

37:53.648 --> 37:56.359
You know, when I have a
client complaint, I shoulder it.

37:56.401 --> 37:58.695
But my biggest concern
right now with Raygan is just

37:58.737 --> 38:00.030
keep them occupied,
get the toys out.

38:00.071 --> 38:01.614
So, you’re gonna
take the guests,

38:01.656 --> 38:02.824
because they can’t ride
them on their own,

38:02.866 --> 38:04.117
they’ve been drinking.

38:04.159 --> 38:05.535
Knowing that they’re
down two people,

38:05.577 --> 38:07.454
we have to work
with what we have.

38:07.495 --> 38:12.125
But that has to be communicated
and not blindside the client.

38:12.167 --> 38:14.252
I’m gonna get changed.

38:14.294 --> 38:19.632
Oh. No.

38:19.674 --> 38:20.925
Oh, yeah? Why?

38:26.389 --> 38:28.183
Sandy, you are a hands-on...

38:28.224 --> 38:29.976
You know, and this
is how I started.

38:30.018 --> 38:31.269
Really?

38:31.311 --> 38:33.313
Oh, yeah, I just didn’t
start driving a boat.

38:33.355 --> 38:36.191
Kyle, I’m gonna have to love
and leave you,

38:36.232 --> 38:38.151
because they want me to take
all of their, like,

38:38.193 --> 38:40.028
two bags of laundry, then they
want me to press their outfits

38:40.070 --> 38:45.492
for tonight, and then I’ve gotta
go do and unpack the master.

38:45.533 --> 38:46.493
Goodbye!

38:46.534 --> 38:47.911
How you feeling, Dave?

38:47.952 --> 38:49.996
The thought knowing that
I’m not gonna catch up

38:50.038 --> 38:52.457
this whole trip is annoying
me a little bit.

38:52.499 --> 38:54.000
Yeah, same.

38:54.042 --> 38:56.294
It’s a tough adjustment,
going from a bigger boat

38:56.336 --> 38:59.881
to a smaller boat, just
because my job is to delegate.

38:59.923 --> 39:02.676
So, to just go down
to two stews,

39:02.717 --> 39:04.844
your job role slightly changes.

39:04.886 --> 39:08.181
People say if you don’t
laugh, you cry, right? But...

39:10.433 --> 39:13.186
Start trying to help each other.

39:13.228 --> 39:14.562
Ooh.

39:14.604 --> 39:17.607
-We good to go?
-Yeah. You’ll go with me?

39:17.649 --> 39:20.527
-I suppose.
-Yeah.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.237
[laughing]

39:24.906 --> 39:27.242
So much clothing,
so little time.

39:32.706 --> 39:34.582
That looks like so much fun!

39:34.624 --> 39:36.292
Chris is with Raygan.

39:36.334 --> 39:37.711
Billy hates Raygan, so it’s
good they’re not together.

39:37.752 --> 39:40.255
Yeah. Exactly.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.340
Do you want me to go and
start your menu again?

39:42.382 --> 39:43.758
No, let’s do French.

39:44.884 --> 39:46.302
I’m like a dolphin.

39:46.344 --> 39:47.762
A majestic one, too.

39:49.097 --> 39:51.182
What time are we doing dinner?

39:52.892 --> 39:54.227
You’re a very good French chef.

39:54.269 --> 39:55.687
Ah, merci.

39:55.729 --> 39:57.022
The primary didn’t really care
for lunch.

39:57.063 --> 39:59.566
They were very particular
on the exact...

39:59.607 --> 40:00.692
on everything they wanted.

40:00.734 --> 40:03.194
Dinner is 9:00, 9:30.

40:03.236 --> 40:04.320
Perfect.

40:04.362 --> 40:06.406
It’s not like I have
all day to prep,

40:06.448 --> 40:09.909
and then on top of that I put
so much pressure on myself.

40:09.951 --> 40:11.244
I mean, my mom and dad
didn’t have any money,

40:11.286 --> 40:14.080
so at the age of 13,
I just worked as much

40:14.122 --> 40:15.874
as I could, washing pots
at a busy restaurant,

40:15.915 --> 40:18.084
sweeping the floors,
all the sh-- jobs.

40:18.126 --> 40:20.503
The pressure is
high on this dinner.

40:20.545 --> 40:21.921
I am afraid to fail.

40:21.963 --> 40:23.715
Buffet for main or
just do all plated?

40:23.757 --> 40:25.842
Well, let’s do plated
and see what happens.

40:25.884 --> 40:28.345
-Jason, you’re the best.
-Ooh!

40:30.221 --> 40:32.140
We’ve gotta set for
dinner and everything.

40:33.308 --> 40:34.893
We need, like,
a few smaller ones.

40:34.934 --> 40:36.603
The centerpiece was
not very grand today.

40:36.644 --> 40:38.063
Two hours till dinner.

40:44.027 --> 40:45.612
Ah!

40:45.653 --> 40:46.821
Ooh.

40:46.863 --> 40:48.615
Okay, I’m here to help.

40:48.656 --> 40:49.908
We get our deckhands tonight.

40:49.949 --> 40:52.243
You gotta hold it
tight with two hands...

40:52.285 --> 40:53.244
Yeah, yeah.

40:53.286 --> 40:56.456
...so it stops swinging.
Good job.

40:56.498 --> 40:58.375
So, is all your stuff ready
for me to grab for pressing?

40:58.416 --> 40:59.584
Yeah, it’s just on one bed.

40:59.626 --> 41:01.002
-Thank you.
-No problem, thank you.

41:05.507 --> 41:06.675
Ah...

41:06.716 --> 41:08.093
Jesus Christ.

41:12.555 --> 41:15.684
Think of the tip, just the tip.

41:16.685 --> 41:17.686
Here’s a delivery.

41:17.727 --> 41:19.312
You wanna go rest until 12:00?

41:19.354 --> 41:21.898
I can go help them, depending on
what time my anchor watch is.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.983
I can do your 2:00,
so you’ll get sleep,

41:24.025 --> 41:25.360
which you do need, yeah?

41:25.402 --> 41:26.820
-I’ll just do the first one.
-Yeah.

41:26.861 --> 41:29.823
Hi, friend.

41:29.864 --> 41:31.032
Am I the only person
wearing a suit tonight?

41:31.074 --> 41:34.411
-You are.
-You guys are trash.

41:34.452 --> 41:35.370
How’s it going?

41:36.663 --> 41:37.997
They’re coming.

41:38.039 --> 41:38.957
Yeah.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.211
That’s mainly what
I’m concerned about, too.

41:45.505 --> 41:46.798
Are we ready?

41:46.840 --> 41:48.008
You’re more than welcome
to move up.

41:48.049 --> 41:49.467
Yeah.

41:49.509 --> 41:52.721
<i>Tash, Tash, we have the</i>
<i>guests sitting at the table.</i>

41:52.762 --> 41:54.180
Oh, it smells so good.

41:54.222 --> 41:56.850
What’s going on
with the provisioning.

41:56.891 --> 41:59.060
It’s just so disorganized.

41:59.102 --> 42:02.313
Hey, Siri, change the
lights to not this.

42:06.192 --> 42:07.527
-Thank you so much.
-You’re welcome.

42:07.569 --> 42:09.154
----ing good.

42:09.195 --> 42:10.780
<i>Tash, Tash, Dave,</i>
<i>make your way to the galley.</i>

42:10.822 --> 42:12.115
We need to run the food out.

42:12.157 --> 42:13.825
-Yeah, of course.
-Let’s go.

42:16.911 --> 42:18.747
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

42:18.788 --> 42:20.206
Hey, guys, we’re ready to go.

42:20.248 --> 42:22.417
Oh, my God, I just wanna
jump in this bed.

42:23.585 --> 42:25.128
Yes!

42:29.924 --> 42:31.217
Thank you.

42:31.259 --> 42:33.595
So, here we have your
Wagyu beef steak,

42:33.636 --> 42:38.475
served with wild mushrooms and
mashed potatoes... enjoy.

42:38.516 --> 42:40.268
-Thank you, love.
-This is delicious.

42:42.103 --> 42:43.813
Mm...

42:43.855 --> 42:46.232
It’s cooked perfectly,
it’s good.

42:46.274 --> 42:47.150
Kyle.

42:47.192 --> 42:51.446
So, it’s a little more rare.

42:51.488 --> 42:54.449
If we can just cook it just
a little bit more, thank you.

42:54.491 --> 42:56.910
All right, yeah, gotcha.

42:56.951 --> 42:58.286
I can’t believe
I had to send that back.

42:58.328 --> 43:00.955
Everything’s perfect,
it’s just Billy.

43:00.997 --> 43:02.415
He’s just asking if we can
go a tiny bit more

43:02.457 --> 43:03.583
on the medium side.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.001
Sorry, bud.

43:05.877 --> 43:07.754
This is perfectly cooked.

43:07.796 --> 43:08.838
It’s Wagyu beef.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.674
You could eat it raw.

43:10.715 --> 43:12.926
Yeah, this is just ridiculous.

43:15.970 --> 43:16.930
Oh [bleep].

43:16.971 --> 43:18.139
Coming up...

43:18.181 --> 43:19.015
[bleep]

43:19.057 --> 43:20.266
All crew, all crew, hang on.

43:20.308 --> 43:22.894
Are we crashing?
What’s happening?

43:33.446 --> 43:34.197
I think those are our deckhands.

43:37.033 --> 43:39.953
I believe our deckhands
are arriving.

43:39.994 --> 43:41.329
I cannot believe it.

43:41.371 --> 43:42.622
Billy, did you already
finish yours?

43:42.664 --> 43:43.873
Why don’t you have a plate?

43:43.915 --> 43:46.251
I had a plate,
and it was not medium.

43:49.045 --> 43:51.047
Couldn’t have been
better timing.

43:51.089 --> 43:52.382
I take that back...

43:52.424 --> 43:55.343
better timing would
have been yesterday.

43:55.385 --> 43:57.053
Thank you.

43:57.971 --> 44:00.515
-Yay!
-Hey, I know.

44:00.557 --> 44:03.435
I’m so happy.

44:03.476 --> 44:04.936
Thank you so much.

44:04.978 --> 44:06.938
You are most welcome.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.314
You wanna throw me the line?

44:12.402 --> 44:14.863
-Mm. It is good, though.
-Whew.

44:14.904 --> 44:16.406
Hello, it’s so good to meet you.

44:16.448 --> 44:17.282
Storm, welcome.

44:17.323 --> 44:18.658
So stoked to finally be here.

44:18.700 --> 44:20.785
Yeah, we’re...
I’m really happy.

44:20.827 --> 44:22.120
Hello, Captain Sandy.

44:22.162 --> 44:23.705
-Hey, so good to see you.
-How are you?

44:23.747 --> 44:26.374
-I’m so happy to have you back.
-Yeah, sorry we’re late.

44:26.416 --> 44:28.293
Literally feels like
breaking out of prison,

44:28.335 --> 44:29.627
getting out of quarantine.

44:29.669 --> 44:31.838
Since I worked on
Lady Michelle last year,

44:31.880 --> 44:33.798
because of the pandemic,
it’s just been such a struggle,

44:33.840 --> 44:35.175
because South Africa’s been

44:35.216 --> 44:36.718
literally on every
country’s red list.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.470
So, I think I’m gonna have
to step it up

44:38.511 --> 44:40.347
and hit it hard from
the ground, running,

44:40.388 --> 44:42.265
just because it would seem
like we’ve just been chilling

44:42.307 --> 44:44.517
in quarantine, but
quarantine ain’t easy, either,

44:44.559 --> 44:46.811
I can tell you
that much for free.

44:46.853 --> 44:48.772
-This is Storm.
-Hey, dude.

44:48.813 --> 44:50.023
-Storm.
-Pleasure to meet you.

44:50.065 --> 44:51.399
-Mzi.
-Hi.

44:51.441 --> 44:52.650
-Hi, I’m Raygan.
-Nice to meet you.

44:52.692 --> 44:53.735
You like some more wine?

44:53.777 --> 44:54.736
I’m good right now, thank you.

44:54.778 --> 44:56.196
Fantastic.

44:56.237 --> 44:57.697
I’m gonna show you
what you’re doing.

44:57.739 --> 44:58.907
-Oh, yes, ma’am.
-Because he’s on till midnight.

44:58.948 --> 45:00.325
Oh, yes, of course.

45:00.367 --> 45:01.951
So, I can tell Mzi, and
Mzi can relate it to you.

45:01.993 --> 45:02.994
-Yeah.
-You wanna come with me?

45:03.036 --> 45:04.662
Yeah, I’ll do that. Okay.

45:07.165 --> 45:08.792
This is your job tonight.

45:08.833 --> 45:12.087
I really need this sorted,
because it’s a safety issue.

45:15.173 --> 45:16.925
Got it, thank you.

45:16.966 --> 45:19.928
Okay.

45:19.969 --> 45:21.221
What?

45:21.262 --> 45:23.306
I can’t hear you
through my placemat.

45:26.768 --> 45:28.436
I’ve been sailing for
the past four years.

45:28.478 --> 45:30.605
I’m a dirtbag pirate, basically.

45:30.647 --> 45:33.149
Some people don’t enjoy me,
but that’s okay.

45:33.191 --> 45:36.236
I think if everyone likes you,
you’re doing something wrong.

45:36.277 --> 45:37.404
Okay, well, I’ll go
ahead and get changed.

45:37.445 --> 45:39.781
I don’t wear underpants, though.

45:39.823 --> 45:42.117
I can’t do with the door open.

45:42.158 --> 45:43.618
-Oh, look, dessert.
-Ooh!

45:43.660 --> 45:44.994
Yay!

45:45.036 --> 45:46.287
Thank you.

45:46.329 --> 45:48.707
We’ve got a medley of
wild fruits,

45:48.748 --> 45:51.251
hot chocolate fondue,
with vegan banana parfait.

45:51.292 --> 45:54.212
-Thank you so much.
-Enjoy.

45:54.254 --> 45:56.297
Now I’m done.

45:56.339 --> 45:58.341
-It’s very good.
-It’s delicious.

45:58.383 --> 45:59.676
It’s really good.

45:59.718 --> 46:01.344
Hi. I’m Natalya.

46:01.386 --> 46:02.679
Sorry, I’m, like, a sweaty mess,

46:02.721 --> 46:04.848
trying to get used
to everyone... Storm.

46:04.889 --> 46:07.600
-Storm, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, yeah.

46:07.642 --> 46:10.145
Oh, Storm is pretty fit.

46:10.186 --> 46:14.607
So many new faces.
Mm.

46:14.649 --> 46:16.026
Okay, okay.

46:16.067 --> 46:19.487
Kyle, drag queen I think’s
about five minutes out.

46:19.529 --> 46:22.866
So, we need to make it
a bit more of a vibe.

46:22.907 --> 46:23.908
She’s gonna do my face for fun.

46:23.950 --> 46:25.118
-Quickly?
-Yeah.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.411
Shall I come out dressed
as a man, then?

46:26.453 --> 46:27.746
-One hundred percent.
-Okay.

46:27.787 --> 46:29.330
Yeah.

46:29.372 --> 46:31.166
Dave, am I all right to get
into some of your clothes?

46:31.207 --> 46:32.917
Take what you want,
just take anything.

46:32.959 --> 46:34.544
Perfect.

46:34.586 --> 46:36.463
I’m just gonna make space
in the forepeak,

46:36.504 --> 46:39.007
so we’ve got rubbish on one side
and provisions on another.

46:39.049 --> 46:42.344
-It’s only 11:00.
-Party, partying.

46:42.385 --> 46:45.555
Make it filthy, bitch.

46:45.597 --> 46:48.725
Today, we’re using the
412 blend brush 77.

46:52.979 --> 46:54.022
[bleep] me, brü.

46:54.064 --> 46:55.648
Such a mess down there.

46:55.690 --> 46:57.859
So, myself and Storm,
we’ve been childhood friends.

46:57.901 --> 46:59.778
We used to play water polo
against each other.

46:59.819 --> 47:01.237
Mzi is my ----ing homie.

47:01.279 --> 47:05.033
When I was 13, Storm looked
like an 18-year-old man,

47:05.075 --> 47:06.785
and we were petrified of him,

47:06.826 --> 47:09.079
he just had hair everywhere.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.748
Obviously, our team
----ed his team up.

47:11.790 --> 47:16.878
That same moustache he has
today, he’s had since he was 13.

47:16.920 --> 47:18.046
Got you.

47:18.088 --> 47:20.590
-Damn!
-Boom, boom.

47:22.217 --> 47:23.760
The drag queen is here.

47:25.553 --> 47:27.222
I’m not gonna lie, I would
actually sit on your face.

47:27.263 --> 47:29.265
[laughing]

47:29.307 --> 47:31.142
My strong point
is theme parties.

47:33.978 --> 47:38.108
My grandma would treat me and my
sister to trips to the theater,

47:38.149 --> 47:40.735
and it just felt, like,
electric for me.

47:40.777 --> 47:43.947
And to be able
to entertain guests

47:43.988 --> 47:48.785
and make other people feel that
way is how I felt as a child

47:48.827 --> 47:50.453
it’s just magic.

47:50.495 --> 47:55.583
Yay! Woo! Yes! Oh, my God!

47:55.625 --> 47:57.252
Do you guys wanna
meet my best friend?

47:57.293 --> 47:59.671
-Holy sh--.
-Follow me!

47:59.713 --> 48:01.089
-What is happening?
-I love this!

48:01.131 --> 48:06.011
Hey!

48:06.052 --> 48:08.138
Ah!

48:08.179 --> 48:09.764
Work it, girl, work it!

48:09.806 --> 48:10.890
Oh, my God!

48:10.932 --> 48:16.521
Ah, ah, ah... oh, my God.

48:16.563 --> 48:17.689
Hey!

48:17.731 --> 48:19.065
Woo! Jesus!

48:19.107 --> 48:20.483
All right, bitch.

48:20.525 --> 48:22.902
-Woohoo!
-Work it! Work!

48:22.944 --> 48:25.238
[cheering]

48:26.698 --> 48:29.492
That’s amazing.
You’re incredible.

48:33.496 --> 48:36.124
Thank the Lord we could pull
tonight together.

48:36.166 --> 48:40.337
Yeah! I love this!

48:40.378 --> 48:42.130
I’m happy, like,
if they’re happy.

48:42.172 --> 48:44.674
Everyone say, "Drag queen!"

48:44.716 --> 48:46.092
Drag queen!

48:46.134 --> 48:48.762
Woohoo!

48:48.803 --> 48:49.846
This should be good.

48:53.433 --> 48:54.434
-Mwah.
-Thank you.

48:54.476 --> 48:55.727
Goodbye, thank you.

48:55.769 --> 48:57.937
Oh!

48:57.979 --> 48:59.439
Holy sh--!

48:59.481 --> 49:00.982
Do you want me to work 12:00
to 4:00 anchor watch?

49:01.024 --> 49:03.193
Yeah.

49:03.234 --> 49:05.570
You’re gonna get
on deck for 7:00.

49:05.612 --> 49:06.654
Gotcha.

49:06.696 --> 49:09.991
-See you tomorrow.
-Hasta la mañana.

49:10.033 --> 49:11.868
-Night, guys.
-Good night.

49:11.910 --> 49:13.244
All right, good night.

49:13.286 --> 49:14.704
Good night, hon.

49:14.746 --> 49:16.664
-Good night, Ryan.
-Good night.

49:20.126 --> 49:22.379
So, how long have you and
Chef been seeing each other?

49:22.420 --> 49:25.256
-I’m not seeing the chef.
-Bullsh--, babes.

49:25.298 --> 49:27.342
You guys have this
beautiful connection.

49:27.384 --> 49:29.386
We’re not!

49:30.553 --> 49:32.430
You’re literally
smiling ear-to-ear.

49:33.932 --> 49:36.518
Well, I don’t... no, we’re
not seeing each other.

49:36.559 --> 49:38.103
Really?

49:38.144 --> 49:43.024
I’ve had two very long-term
relationships on previous boats.

49:43.066 --> 49:48.238
It was nice, because to share
your cabin with your partner,

49:48.279 --> 49:51.533
you can really
blow off some steam,

49:51.574 --> 49:54.536
and you can trust them not
to say anything to anyone.

49:54.577 --> 49:58.331
If I saw him in a pub, I would
literally eat any meal he makes.

49:58.373 --> 50:00.500
You know what I mean?

50:00.542 --> 50:01.710
Oh! Including him.

50:01.751 --> 50:02.961
He is the meal.

50:03.003 --> 50:04.963
I don’t like being single.

50:05.005 --> 50:07.632
I get really lonely easily.

50:07.674 --> 50:10.885
I know, I shouldn’t
think like that.

50:10.927 --> 50:11.970
Ah.

50:12.012 --> 50:12.971
Okay, I’m going.

50:13.013 --> 50:14.139
Thanks so much for a great day.

50:45.045 --> 50:46.504
Okay, cool.

50:53.762 --> 50:55.513
Mm-hmm.

50:57.182 --> 50:58.975
Let’s do this.

51:04.731 --> 51:06.775
Wow, we will have a swell.

51:09.361 --> 51:10.737
Good morning.

51:10.779 --> 51:12.072
Okay, we’re just finishing
the main deck,

51:12.113 --> 51:15.241
just wiping the sides
and the deck.

51:15.283 --> 51:16.242
Okay.

51:16.284 --> 51:18.161
Morning.
Hi.

51:18.203 --> 51:20.288
-Morning.
-Want a coffee?

51:20.330 --> 51:22.874
-I’ve got one over there.
-Oh.

51:25.293 --> 51:28.421
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

51:28.463 --> 51:32.676
Where’s my anchor
watch schedule?

51:32.717 --> 51:34.469
Every bosun has
a watch schedule.

51:34.511 --> 51:36.846
This should have been
done on day one.

51:36.888 --> 51:38.973
Raygan, Raygan, to the bridge.

51:39.015 --> 51:40.183
Copy.

51:40.225 --> 51:43.228
I’m expected to see
your watch schedule

51:43.269 --> 51:45.271
so I can approve
it to make sure

51:45.313 --> 51:47.148
that I’m comfortable with
who you have on bridge watch.

51:47.190 --> 51:49.275
So, where’s your schedule?

51:49.317 --> 51:50.985
Hm?

51:51.027 --> 51:53.405
For people’s, like, where...
I need that, they need that.

51:53.446 --> 51:54.989
Yeah, yeah, I’m gonna write it.

51:55.031 --> 51:59.077
Getting up this morning,
and Mzi’s getting up at 10:00.

51:59.119 --> 52:00.620
We’re gonna have break,

52:00.662 --> 52:02.038
and have a talk then, so
I’ll write it all down on break.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.832
No, you need to do
that this morning.

52:03.873 --> 52:06.084
Also, the tender should have
been in the water already.

52:06.126 --> 52:07.168
Okay.

52:07.210 --> 52:08.670
The tender we’re gonna drive...

52:08.712 --> 52:10.005
I was just clean up just
quickly, doing the main deck.

52:10.046 --> 52:11.464
We’re just finishing
that quickly.

52:11.506 --> 52:12.382
No, no, no,
you have two deckhands.

52:12.424 --> 52:13.550
Toys, toys, toys.

52:13.591 --> 52:14.718
-Yeah.
-It’s a priority.

52:14.759 --> 52:15.760
Mm-hmm.

52:15.802 --> 52:16.970
Tender, WaveRunners,
in the water.

52:17.012 --> 52:18.471
Okay.

52:18.513 --> 52:20.932
My last boat that was in Italy,
it was a private as well,

52:20.974 --> 52:22.475
so they’re not
being so demanding,

52:22.517 --> 52:23.935
so they’ve been quite relaxed.

52:23.977 --> 52:27.063
So, this is the most
demanding charter experience

52:27.105 --> 52:28.273
I’ve had in a long time.

52:28.314 --> 52:29.941
-Tender in the water.
-Okay.

52:29.983 --> 52:32.027
Before we leave.
And then your schedule.

52:32.068 --> 52:33.945
Yeah, no problem.

52:35.989 --> 52:37.407
I think they’ll like that.

52:37.449 --> 52:38.783
It looks nice.

52:38.825 --> 52:40.201
We’re gonna put
the tender in the water.

52:40.243 --> 52:41.244
All right.

52:41.286 --> 52:42.829
Carlos, Carlos, Raygan.

52:42.871 --> 52:44.706
Yeah, go ahead for Carlos.

52:44.748 --> 52:48.084
Yeah, I’m gonna need your help
for the tender, please.

52:48.126 --> 52:49.419
Special with sausage.

52:49.461 --> 52:52.255
-Yes, please. Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

52:52.297 --> 52:55.258
Do you like what you see?
You like these jugs?

52:55.300 --> 52:56.718
Oh!

52:56.760 --> 52:59.596
Okay, so the bow’s gonna
go towards the aft.

52:59.637 --> 53:01.348
Jason, do you hear me?

53:01.389 --> 53:04.351
Uh-huh.

53:04.392 --> 53:05.602
Keep it tight.

53:05.643 --> 53:07.020
-No, it’s going...
-Not too tight.

53:07.062 --> 53:08.480
You said it’s going
to the ----ing aft.

53:08.521 --> 53:09.689
I got it, just let it
swing around.

53:09.731 --> 53:10.940
-Right, it’s like...
-Huh?

53:10.982 --> 53:12.275
...quit telling me to...
you can’t...

53:12.317 --> 53:13.276
Can you hold it tightly, Jason?

53:13.318 --> 53:14.736
Huh?

53:14.778 --> 53:16.905
Hold it tight towards the boat.
Storm?

53:16.946 --> 53:22.619
-Okay, can I go?
-Okay, go now.

53:22.660 --> 53:24.120
Yeah, have a little drive around

53:24.162 --> 53:26.289
and see what the steering and
everything is like.

53:26.331 --> 53:27.499
Yep.

53:27.540 --> 53:28.792
I’m gonna change.

53:28.833 --> 53:29.959
Are they ready for us
in the water?

53:30.001 --> 53:31.670
We’re ready for the water.

53:40.845 --> 53:42.931
Good morning, sweetheart.

53:45.183 --> 53:47.310
[laughing]

53:47.352 --> 53:48.645
Just let you know...

53:57.195 --> 53:58.697
[creaking]

54:03.159 --> 54:04.160
Oh!

54:04.202 --> 54:05.870
-Kyle?
-Hello, there.

54:05.912 --> 54:07.622
Are you able to nip up
to bridge deck aft

54:07.664 --> 54:09.207
and just get the table clear?

54:09.249 --> 54:10.667
-Yeah.
-Thanks, hon.

54:10.709 --> 54:12.627
I need every toy in the water.

54:12.669 --> 54:14.546
They’re burning up, they’re
ready to get in the water.

54:14.587 --> 54:15.588
Cool, cool, cool.

54:15.630 --> 54:19.092
We just lost our stabilizers.

54:25.265 --> 54:26.683
All crew, all crew,

54:26.725 --> 54:29.936
we have some malfunctioning
of our stabilizers.

54:29.978 --> 54:31.438
Oh sh--.

54:31.479 --> 54:34.315
Ah... I’m gonna fall.

54:37.986 --> 54:40.655
-The boat’s rocking!
-Are we crashing?

54:40.697 --> 54:44.034
-What’s happening?
-----ing hell!

54:45.994 --> 54:47.704
Oh, my God.

54:51.416 --> 54:52.542
All crew, all crew, hang on.

54:52.584 --> 54:53.543
Hold everything!

54:53.585 --> 54:55.170
All crew, all crew, hang on.

54:55.211 --> 54:56.212
Ah!

54:57.922 --> 55:00.008
Ah!

55:00.050 --> 55:01.926
[shouting]

55:01.968 --> 55:03.803
Where are the lifejackets?

55:05.472 --> 55:08.141
-Oh, my God, oh, my God.
-Oh my God.

55:08.183 --> 55:09.351
[bleep]
