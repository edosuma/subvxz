03:19.140 --> 03:19.973
Oh, God.

03:21.736 --> 03:22.569
Uh.

03:23.792 --> 03:24.875
What is that?

03:29.466 --> 03:34.466
Oh, God.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.158
Otis, Otis?

04:04.160 --> 04:05.558
Do you read? It's Click.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.391
Come in.

04:06.393 --> 04:08.358
Hey, hey, hey, Click. Right here.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.193
What's going on?

04:10.650 --> 04:12.411
Otis, I think this is it.

04:12.413 --> 04:14.938
I think we found what we're looking for.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.197
That's fantastic.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.392
Just keep me updated.

04:18.742 --> 04:21.028
I think it's some sort
of video archive system.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.180
I'm going to try and
get it up and running.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.358
You sound anxious.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.800
Did you run into any trouble down there?

04:33.033 --> 04:35.116
Ooh, now we're talking.

05:00.365 --> 05:02.092
What is this?

05:09.394 --> 05:10.227
Oh.

06:01.924 --> 06:02.757
Hmm.

06:07.389 --> 06:08.222
Hmm.

06:10.956 --> 06:14.274
Yeah, possible hostile
contact in sector 3. Standby.

06:50.448 --> 06:52.476
Charles, contact confirmed.

06:55.796 --> 06:56.653
Shit.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.326
Hey.

07:45.336 --> 07:46.586
Really?

07:51.973 --> 07:53.803
Yeah, we got the bodies out.

12:20.730 --> 12:21.658
Otis, come in.

12:21.660 --> 12:22.868
I got it up and running.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.770
You're not gonna believe what I found.

12:25.854 --> 12:28.974
This is the
discovery of the year.

12:52.384 --> 12:54.244
Madam Chell's Red-Light
District Cathouse.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.238
It's spring across the Southern Sector,

13:03.240 --> 13:04.627
which means two things:

13:04.629 --> 13:05.888
Transfer students

13:05.890 --> 13:07.088
are boarding drop ships

13:07.090 --> 13:09.378
for the lunar colony education cycle,

13:09.380 --> 13:13.148
and it's time to watch
out for those egg sacs

13:13.150 --> 13:17.208
because the Trioxin 245
spiders are hatching.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.817
Let's send it out to
Aurora Hakiki who has more.

13:20.950 --> 13:22.028
They look like regular

13:22.030 --> 13:23.068
- mark 5 arachnids,
- Mm.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.748
but Trioxin 245 enhanced
spiders are not garden pests.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.548
They're rad, they're
deadly, and they are growing

13:28.550 --> 13:30.258
in record numbers this cycle.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.988
Old Town and Red District
are taking the highest hit,

13:32.990 --> 13:34.538
travel advisories are in effect.

13:34.540 --> 13:35.886
Kay, back to you.

14:06.675 --> 14:08.634
Fucking trash!

14:47.624 --> 14:50.683
389 credits.

14:56.970 --> 14:57.948
Hi.

14:57.950 --> 15:00.118
If you're with the National
Protection Services,

15:00.120 --> 15:02.919
you have to tell me or it's entrapment.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.768
Great! Then you need to fuck a hooker!

15:16.770 --> 15:17.603
Yay!

15:19.450 --> 15:21.408
Wow. That's direct.

15:21.410 --> 15:22.278
Then come on down

15:22.280 --> 15:24.898
to Madam Chell's Red-Light
District Cathouse.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.100
So go ahead and set up
an appointment today.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.903
Madam Chell's Red-light
District Cathouse.

15:40.770 --> 15:41.968
Hi.

15:41.970 --> 15:45.818
I would like to set up polite
intercourse with a girl.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.028
That'll be 500 credits for one hour.

15:48.030 --> 15:53.030
Ooh! What can I get for 389 credits?

15:55.780 --> 15:57.128
We just happen to have

15:57.130 --> 16:00.158
a super saver package discount today

16:00.160 --> 16:03.448
for our less discerning customers.

16:03.450 --> 16:07.728
Ooh, what do I get for that?

16:07.730 --> 16:10.378
Agnosexual encounter, a half and half.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.178
And a pat on the head.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.458
Great.

16:13.460 --> 16:17.478
Come on down to the
Raspy Beef Hotel, room 89.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.280
Don't knock. One hour.

16:56.752 --> 17:00.085
Put your thumb on the scanner.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.626
Not enough credits.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.667
I cost 389.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.708
I had 389,

17:19.710 --> 17:23.377
but I had to take the
people mover to get here,

17:23.380 --> 17:25.987
and I bought us both hot dogs.

17:29.731 --> 17:33.248
You agreed to 389.

17:33.250 --> 17:36.022
Well I'm sorry I wasted your time.

17:36.024 --> 17:38.996
Did you want your hotdog?

17:41.710 --> 17:43.878
How much do you have?

17:43.880 --> 17:45.364
- 250.
- All right.

17:45.366 --> 17:46.197
Give me that.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.737
What do I get for 250?

18:01.058 --> 18:01.891
Um, sex.

18:11.479 --> 18:15.061
Oh, yeah. Big daddy.

18:15.063 --> 18:16.457
You feel so good.

18:22.370 --> 18:23.616
You wanna get on top?

18:23.618 --> 18:24.599
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

18:24.601 --> 18:25.864
Fuck me!

19:38.167 --> 19:39.197
Music off.

19:45.705 --> 19:46.538
Eh.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.913
Ooh, it's hot in there.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.098
Was that okay?

19:52.100 --> 19:53.680
You're doing great.

19:55.820 --> 20:00.820
Thank you for feeding
all 23,000 of my babies.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.628
Can I go home now?

20:05.630 --> 20:07.182
I haven't seen my family in six months.

20:07.184 --> 20:08.382
So help me, please.

20:08.384 --> 20:09.793
Maybe tomorrow.

20:11.090 --> 20:13.533
I have four more
appointments for me today.

20:17.910 --> 20:20.163
Hey, you're doing a great job.

20:21.370 --> 20:22.770
Who's my little black widow?

20:25.472 --> 20:26.878
Who's my little black widow?

20:26.880 --> 20:27.713
I am.

20:28.910 --> 20:29.743
I am.

20:31.250 --> 20:32.504
That's right.

20:36.204 --> 20:37.070
Hey, hey, hey.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.530
It's not like you're gonna die today.

20:41.642 --> 20:46.642
Huh?

20:57.120 --> 20:59.438
Hey, sexy.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.468
I've got some cocaine.

21:00.470 --> 21:03.648
Both edible and old school powder.

21:03.650 --> 21:06.278
Huh, yeah. Some amyl nitrate.

21:06.280 --> 21:11.280
And 500 credits with
your name all over it.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.128
See the ladies, they call me Chad,

21:15.130 --> 21:20.063
but you can call me Rad.

21:21.763 --> 21:23.596
Oh, yeah. Feel me now.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.728
I can't tell if these are historical

21:32.730 --> 21:35.105
or fictional narratives.

21:35.107 --> 21:38.318
It's hard to say.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.619
Things were a lot different back then.

21:50.384 --> 21:52.906
Do you think it's safe?

21:52.908 --> 21:55.787
To forage here, I mean?
It could be territory.

21:55.789 --> 21:58.727
No, the riders never come up here.

21:58.729 --> 22:01.134
They're way too superstitious.

22:01.136 --> 22:03.136
But keep your eyes open.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.414
Do you think it's true?

22:06.416 --> 22:07.984
What they say about the Northlands?

22:07.986 --> 22:12.240
What that
people never return?

22:12.242 --> 22:14.029
Think you can chock that
up more to feral tribes

22:14.031 --> 22:16.813
than any kind of war ghost.

22:41.892 --> 22:44.541
It's a graveyard up here.

22:44.543 --> 22:48.244
I can see why Sliv and the
others didn't wanna come.

22:48.246 --> 22:49.163
You came.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.667
I won't forget that.

22:52.803 --> 22:55.037
I couldn't let you go by yourself.

22:55.039 --> 22:58.803
Besides, if there is any
water stored up here,

22:58.805 --> 23:03.102
I couldn't let you get
all the praise for it.

24:16.754 --> 24:17.587
Tig!

24:19.446 --> 24:24.446
Come see this.

24:38.034 --> 24:39.201
A sea glass.

24:40.691 --> 24:43.475
Can't do much with those.

24:43.477 --> 24:45.246
It took the ancients long enough

24:45.248 --> 24:47.915
to figure that out on their own.

24:49.095 --> 24:51.602
I haven't seen one since I was little.

24:51.604 --> 24:52.437
Hmm.

24:54.482 --> 24:57.123
Don't stare into it too long.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.875
We've got work to do.

25:00.712 --> 25:03.200
See if you can find something useful.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.535
Dried food, water, supplies.

25:07.310 --> 25:08.143
Yeah.

25:10.211 --> 25:11.628
I know the drill.

26:35.501 --> 26:36.334
Tig?

26:48.171 --> 26:49.060
Tig?

27:06.227 --> 27:07.060
Tig!

27:19.852 --> 27:20.685
Tig?

27:21.541 --> 27:22.982
Stop messing around.

30:02.924 --> 30:04.007
What are you?

30:18.908 --> 30:20.241
What happened?

30:21.607 --> 30:22.440
What...

30:24.664 --> 30:25.747
What's wrong?

30:28.430 --> 30:29.920
What's wrong?

30:29.922 --> 30:31.653
What was that?

30:31.655 --> 30:33.052
What was what?

30:33.054 --> 30:34.630
Who are you?

30:34.632 --> 30:35.873
It's me, Tig.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.050
I don't understand why you're upset.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.477
- Everything's okay.
- What is...

30:38.479 --> 30:40.406
It's okay. It's okay.

30:40.408 --> 30:43.068
Shh, calm down. Calm down.

30:43.070 --> 30:44.820
Calm down. It's okay.

30:45.981 --> 30:48.725
It's okay.

30:48.727 --> 30:51.330
Everything's gonna be okay.

30:51.332 --> 30:53.749
Everything will be just fine.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.845
I have no idea what
I'm watching right now.

31:07.370 --> 31:08.833
It's really bizarre.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.988
Back then people used
to subject themselves

31:12.990 --> 31:15.406
to horror for entertainment.

31:15.408 --> 31:16.285
Insane.

32:12.016 --> 32:14.770
Help me!

35:15.240 --> 35:17.337
Not all are up yet, I see.

35:18.370 --> 35:20.348
What do you think?

35:20.350 --> 35:21.783
Let's get started.

36:07.013 --> 36:08.996
Nile!

36:08.998 --> 36:11.360
Get up and get in here!

36:27.590 --> 36:28.841
Robin?

36:30.650 --> 36:31.493
Robin!

36:31.495 --> 36:32.616
It's not quite the same.

36:32.618 --> 36:33.535
- Is it?
- No.

36:35.602 --> 36:36.692
Robin!

36:40.950 --> 36:43.783
Where are you going? We need to talk.

36:59.631 --> 37:01.438
We need to commence human trials.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.463
What? Are you serious?

37:05.360 --> 37:07.215
- No.
- We have to.

37:07.217 --> 37:09.403
How? How do you
suppose we do that, Nile?

37:11.740 --> 37:13.318
What? Are you insane?

37:13.320 --> 37:15.264
It's the only way we
can ever know for certain.

37:15.266 --> 37:17.803
No, I won't allow it.

37:24.730 --> 37:27.548
You think I don't know
what's been bothering you.

37:27.550 --> 37:30.508
You've been watching the same
damn video for weeks now.

37:30.510 --> 37:31.618
If you want to know
what's happened to Ben-

37:31.620 --> 37:33.883
- Do not talk about my son. Ever!

37:38.560 --> 37:41.698
If you ever wanna see him
again, we have to do this.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.425
I could never risk it, Nile.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.760
You know that.

41:01.230 --> 41:02.063
Nile?

41:02.980 --> 41:04.817
Can I have the next sample please?

41:07.490 --> 41:08.323
Nile?

41:21.983 --> 41:23.983
- He's infected.
- What?

41:24.990 --> 41:25.823
He's infected! Move!

41:40.523 --> 41:42.523
It's over.

41:44.470 --> 41:48.063
There was a message

41:48.065 --> 41:53.065
from ATCORE.

42:08.367 --> 42:11.378
Extinction is eminent.

42:11.380 --> 42:13.033
We are running out of time.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.268
Infection levels have reached far greater

42:18.270 --> 42:20.698
than we could ever have prepared for.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.653
The human race will not last.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.518
Your efforts are now
solely for the continuation

42:26.520 --> 42:28.953
of the few populations
zones left standing.

42:31.530 --> 42:33.628
We regret to inform you
that your loved ones

42:33.630 --> 42:36.193
have not been accounted
for in the remaining zones.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.983
We hope this does not deter your resolve.

42:41.670 --> 42:43.658
Find the solution.

42:43.660 --> 42:44.663
Save us.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.348
The fate of our world and we as a species

42:48.350 --> 42:49.723
is in your hands.

42:51.300 --> 42:52.943
Extinction is eminent.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.863
We are running out of time.

43:05.970 --> 43:06.827
Ben.

43:12.961 --> 43:15.878
We can't give up.

43:16.740 --> 43:19.347
There must be something we can do.

43:20.870 --> 43:25.870
Nile, maybe he was working on something.

43:26.470 --> 43:31.470
Maybe, maybe he found something.

43:34.710 --> 43:35.973
Human trials.

43:38.870 --> 43:40.718
Look, this infection
will only get stronger.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.983
I'm not asking
you to come in with me.

43:43.880 --> 43:44.713
Robin.

43:49.865 --> 43:51.448
The sampling lab.

44:05.045 --> 44:06.598
Nile?

44:54.901 --> 44:55.732
Max!

46:00.950 --> 46:03.709
Facility
lockdown override, activating.

46:41.212 --> 46:44.629
Facility lockdown override in 10 seconds.

46:48.708 --> 46:50.920
Oxygen infection levels
will reach critical

46:50.922 --> 46:51.755
in five,

46:53.672 --> 46:54.505
four,

46:55.567 --> 46:56.398
three,

46:57.562 --> 46:58.395
two,

46:59.506 --> 47:00.704
one.

47:04.137 --> 47:06.047
Air support compromised.

47:06.049 --> 47:07.966
Evacuate the facility.

47:12.680 --> 47:14.063
It wasn't the infection.

47:14.950 --> 47:15.850
It was...

47:19.649 --> 47:20.482
The vaccine.

48:02.966 --> 48:07.578
I don't know whether
that's cool or disgusting.

48:07.580 --> 48:09.108
We could go through that for years

48:09.110 --> 48:10.168
and never figure it out.

48:10.170 --> 48:13.038
The past is riddled with lies.

48:47.342 --> 48:48.509
There he is!

48:56.900 --> 48:58.774
Let's go in there and get him!

48:58.776 --> 48:59.871
No!

49:01.858 --> 49:02.691
What?

49:05.050 --> 49:07.328
Nothing but death in those woods.

49:07.330 --> 49:08.828
But, no!

49:08.830 --> 49:10.077
We go back to the car.

49:35.346 --> 49:36.429
Looks okay.

49:38.035 --> 49:38.868
It's okay.

50:22.807 --> 50:24.653
Sorry. You startled with me there.

50:27.350 --> 50:28.898
My name is Clint.

50:28.900 --> 50:31.098
You are not supposed to be here.

50:31.100 --> 50:33.460
I'm sorry. I was just passing through.

51:00.060 --> 51:00.893
Excuse me?

51:01.870 --> 51:04.123
I think I saw your,
your brother back there.

51:06.670 --> 51:08.120
Is your mom or dad

51:10.140 --> 51:10.973
here?

51:21.590 --> 51:23.490
You are not supposed to be here.

51:33.480 --> 51:34.335
Oh shit!

51:47.240 --> 51:49.743
You are not supposed to be here.

51:53.990 --> 51:56.158
I've had enough of you sons of bitches.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.460
Two can play at this game.

52:31.549 --> 52:32.382
Help!

52:44.664 --> 52:47.548
Have you seen the children?

52:47.550 --> 52:49.058
What?

52:49.060 --> 52:50.820
I'm so proud of them.

52:50.822 --> 52:52.526
I made them myself.

52:59.347 --> 53:01.264
There now, look at you.

53:02.859 --> 53:05.509
I have to protect your eyes.
They're still sensitive.

53:10.550 --> 53:12.799
Yeah, that's right. Mama.

53:12.801 --> 53:13.718
Mama, Mama.

53:15.511 --> 53:16.893
Ma..

53:16.895 --> 53:18.145
- Mama.
- Mama.

53:25.864 --> 53:26.947
You know...

53:28.630 --> 53:31.091
You really are not supposed to be here.

53:33.340 --> 53:34.715
No!

53:36.440 --> 53:37.773
They're so precious.

54:01.940 --> 54:03.498
Such good kids.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.578
You're not
supposed to be here.

54:05.580 --> 54:07.944
I should really make
you a father sometime.

54:07.946 --> 54:10.146
You're not
supposed to be here.

54:12.502 --> 54:13.752
This isn't...

54:16.076 --> 54:18.673
This has to be fiction.

54:20.620 --> 54:22.048
The old ones were crazy.

54:22.050 --> 54:24.158
They blurred the line between reality

54:24.160 --> 54:25.967
and fantasy constantly.

54:39.599 --> 54:42.599
System reboot.

54:47.266 --> 54:48.099
Wait.

54:53.313 --> 54:54.146
Wait.

54:59.170 --> 55:00.003
Wait.

55:05.161 --> 55:05.994
Wait.

55:18.680 --> 55:19.573
Online.

55:25.700 --> 55:30.188
Mainline power will be
restored momentarily.

55:30.190 --> 55:33.618
Welcome to the Semrams Advertising Company

55:33.620 --> 55:37.863
founded in 1888 by William King Greedman.

55:37.865 --> 55:40.328
Semrams has seen itself at the forefront

55:40.330 --> 55:43.608
of ad agencies for generations.

55:43.610 --> 55:46.868

55:46.870 --> 55:50.278

55:53.560 --> 55:56.388

55:56.390 --> 55:59.228
modeling and acting
talents to the battlefront

55:59.230 --> 56:02.488
of the contemporary advertisement wars.

56:02.490 --> 56:06.548
There's a storm coming and you
must fight to stay relevant.

56:06.550 --> 56:08.470
We are glad to back you up.

56:23.905 --> 56:26.874
Incoming call.

56:26.876 --> 56:28.043
Incoming call.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.693
Where did you go?

56:32.670 --> 56:35.598
Mom, don't
worry about me so much.

56:35.600 --> 56:37.743
You never tell me when you're going out.

56:38.660 --> 56:40.738
Breakfast is getting cold.

56:40.740 --> 56:42.448
What a waste of perfectly good food.

56:42.450 --> 56:44.963
Then stop making it for me every day.

56:47.413 --> 56:50.808
You said the animal
shelter starts at nine?

56:50.810 --> 56:52.963
I haven't started that job yet.

56:54.340 --> 56:55.698
But you go it, right?

56:55.700 --> 56:59.403
Yes, but I'm
still exploring my options.

57:00.856 --> 57:03.058
Oh, don't explore that much

57:03.060 --> 57:06.773
or you'll end up with
taxpayers expense like me.

57:06.775 --> 57:08.872
They are not interested in
young women with no jobs.

57:08.874 --> 57:10.638
I gotta go.

57:10.640 --> 57:12.513
Stop worrying. Okay?

57:15.140 --> 57:16.752
You're all I have to worry about.

57:16.754 --> 57:17.970
Goodbye, Mom.

57:20.175 --> 57:21.848
Call ended.

58:15.128 --> 58:18.565
System experiencing
technical difficulties.

58:18.567 --> 58:20.978
Due to severe weather conditions,

58:20.980 --> 58:24.048
our main system is currently down.

58:24.050 --> 58:26.358
Backup System Operational.

58:26.360 --> 58:29.008
We apologize for the inconvenience

58:29.010 --> 58:31.817
and guarantee full
system recovery shortly.

58:31.819 --> 58:33.468
Is someone out there?

58:36.030 --> 58:36.863
Yes.

58:39.970 --> 58:41.998
Sorry if I'm intruding.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.748
What are you doing?

58:44.750 --> 58:49.750
Um, well, I had a modeling
audition here today,

58:50.430 --> 58:53.243
so, I do this a lot.

58:55.090 --> 58:57.263
I've learned it's best to get out early,

58:59.160 --> 59:00.893
and get ready after.

59:02.760 --> 59:05.513
Especially on days like today
with the weather being bad.

59:06.910 --> 59:08.231
There's a storm coming.

59:10.626 --> 59:12.526
It's already hit. Can't you hear it?

59:14.731 --> 59:16.246
System experiencing

59:16.248 --> 59:18.155
technical difficulties.

59:18.157 --> 59:20.578
Due to severe weather conditions,

59:20.580 --> 59:23.648
our main system is currently down.

59:23.650 --> 59:25.958
Backup system, operational.

59:25.960 --> 59:28.588
We apologize for the inconvenience

59:28.590 --> 59:31.866
and guarantee full
system recovery shortly.

01:00:02.873 --> 01:00:05.988
Do you like what you do?

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.438
I love my job.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.088
It becomes me.

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:11.608
You like for
people to stare at you?

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:13.518
I like being admired.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.288
I mean, that is the job right?

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:17.893
Catching people's attention.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.003
My goal is to actually make
it on a billboard someday.

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:29.508
Sounds kind of selfish, I know,

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:34.468
but it excites me to
think that I can inspire,

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.383
that people wanna be like me.

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:39.543
Or not.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.618
That's interesting too.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.713
Having haters.

01:00:44.695 --> 01:00:47.195
At least you know
you're still a somebody.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.678
What sort of message do you wanna

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.553
get across to these people?

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.040
You mean when I wanna advertise?

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:57.513
Well anything really.

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:02.003
What to wear or to eat.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.783
Who to date.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.723
When to make love. How to pray.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:09.433
Done it all, sort of.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:14.013
I like being positive about
every job that comes my way.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.068
It's just fun to be able to
invoke some sort of emotion.

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:20.567
Even if there's no message, really.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.948
Everything's an experience, right?

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.168
I don't turn down experiences.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:31.102
I'm always learning and evolving.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.088
I'm just waiting for my big break.

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:39.340
And when it comes, it
has to be my best work.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.799
What if you're not at your best?

01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:49.325
What if you don't like what you see?

01:01:49.327 --> 01:01:50.973
The audition started already.

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:56.773
So long as they like
it, the people that is.

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.618
But you're right, I have
to learn to love myself

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.433
before I can let others love me.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:09.159
And I'm learning to do that
more and more every day.

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:18.063
That's a good sign.

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:21.718
I've been having my picture taken

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.198
and put on display in some way or another.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.633
since I was a baby.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:29.508
My mom was a photographer.

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:31.113
I've been modeling since birth.

01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:36.043
It's my passion, my journey in life.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:44.170
I just want every moment documented.

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:48.073
And if you die?

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.608
If that image people have of you

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:53.543
isn't those moments after your death?

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.036
Have you seen pictures of dead people?

01:03:07.004 --> 01:03:08.837
I have to get going.

01:03:16.154 --> 01:03:17.558
System experiencing

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.718
technical difficulties.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.958
Due to sever weather conditions,

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.018
our main system is currently down.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.338
Backup system, operational.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.968
We apologize for the inconvenience

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.935
and guarantee full
system recovery shortly.

01:03:40.537 --> 01:03:42.537
Beautiful death.

01:03:45.427 --> 01:03:46.927
A beautiful death.

01:05:38.218 --> 01:05:42.732
The unseen and its
promise of the unknown,

01:05:42.734 --> 01:05:45.578
has forever fathered the impulse

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.663
to seek for new things in new guises.

01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:54.385
This world demands a world of beauty.

01:05:55.598 --> 01:05:58.598
These internal things wrought by God

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.223
are lovely and unchanging.

01:06:03.532 --> 01:06:07.115
A new world is constantly
opening before us.

01:06:07.117 --> 01:06:10.443
An ever-accelerating greater progress.

01:06:10.445 --> 01:06:13.195
A greater growth, a better world,

01:06:14.265 --> 01:06:17.682
a world which always been pulled forward.

01:06:19.145 --> 01:06:22.407
Made possible by constant striving

01:06:22.409 --> 01:06:24.992
toward new and better horizons.

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:35.284
And then we'll come to an ample eye.

01:06:35.286 --> 01:06:38.387
Seeing everything and
recording everything.

01:06:48.603 --> 01:06:51.043
To provide everything human...

01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:18.003
Have either of you
heard anything strange?

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.193
Strange? How do you mean?

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.743
Voices that come from nowhere?

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.858
You're a funny little girl.

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.448
What is your name?

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:35.058
Aria.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.178
Hello, Aria. I'm Selena.

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.838
Yes. I feel like I've
known you for so long.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.158
I see you everywhere.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.353
I've worked here hundreds of times.

01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:46.078
Since I was 17.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.908
- I've heard somebody-
- And I haven't seen

01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:50.218
anything that would lead me to believe

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.083
that this place is haunted, Aria.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.088
I didn't say haunted.

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.068
I don't believe in that.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:57.943
Who does?

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:00.794
Nevermind.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.070
You know what they used to do here?

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.318
Postmortem portraits.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.698
Posed photographs of the dead.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.208
Back then, photography
wasn't widely available.

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.313
So people had their loved ones
photo taken when they died.

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.858
Probably because they didn't have

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:23.548
any done while they were still alive.

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:25.188
Scary, huh?

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:27.758
But that's how the studio started.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.147
It sends shivers down my spine, Aria.

01:10:09.446 --> 01:10:12.853
Photographs bring
news reports to life.

01:10:12.855 --> 01:10:15.944
They strengthen the appeal of advertising.

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:18.728
They provide entertainment for millions.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.930
We are done, if
you want use the mirror, Aria.

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:36.608
I hope you get this job.

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.447
I'd like to see you around.

01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:43.808
We'll see. If not, I'll keep trying.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:44.863
I don't quit.

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.984
Maybe you
did encounter a ghost.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.258
Maybe it's envious of you, Aria.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.586
You are still alive.

01:11:52.884 --> 01:11:54.559
A beautiful death.

01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:34.605
Relax, Aria.

01:12:43.786 --> 01:12:46.953
'Cause they don't remember us.

01:13:02.723 --> 01:13:04.023
Where'd you go?

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.928
Young model found dead

01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:09.253
in popular commercial building restroom.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.180
The body of one Aria Christiansen

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:15.798
had been found discovered Sunday evening.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.093
Post in fashion model forum.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:24.951
We have no frame of reference

01:13:24.953 --> 01:13:27.583
to be able to tell what this is.

01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:33.003
Ancient peoples had strange customs.

01:13:43.675 --> 01:13:46.408
No, he's not, he's not the problem.

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:47.698
There just isn't a lot of, you know,

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.650
acting jobs going around at the moment.

01:13:51.354 --> 01:13:54.758
Uh, no, I, okay. Listen.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.228
I'm not, I'm not gonna
ask my engineer brother

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:58.733
for acting advice, okay?

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.158
Oh, oh you, oh, no.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.588
God, listen. It's getting really late.

01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:06.990
So I'm just gonna go to bed.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:12.203
Yeah, I love you too.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.273
Hmm.

01:15:38.989 --> 01:15:40.783
Help! Somebody!

01:15:40.785 --> 01:15:41.785
Help! Hello!

01:15:42.727 --> 01:15:45.206
Please help me! Get me out of here!

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:46.041
Hello!

01:16:20.567 --> 01:16:22.317
No! No, wait, come...

01:16:23.307 --> 01:16:24.140
Come back.

01:16:40.908 --> 01:16:41.741
Ow!

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.740
Who's there?

01:17:14.013 --> 01:17:16.183
What the fuck do you want?

01:17:16.185 --> 01:17:17.605
Huh?

01:17:28.993 --> 01:17:30.576
You're a sick fuck.

01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:11.691
No.

01:18:13.361 --> 01:18:14.693
Stop!

01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:16.362
Get off me. Get off!

01:18:18.483 --> 01:18:20.180
What do you want from...

01:18:20.182 --> 01:18:21.015
Get off!

01:18:27.344 --> 01:18:28.948
Get away from me!

01:18:32.823 --> 01:18:33.740
Please! No!

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:36.180
No, no, no, no!

01:18:37.655 --> 01:18:39.405
Let go of me! No, no!

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.533
No, let me go!

01:18:41.535 --> 01:18:42.368
Let me go!

01:18:45.537 --> 01:18:46.787
No, no, no, no!

01:19:00.077 --> 01:19:01.660
No, no, no, no, no!

01:19:02.979 --> 01:19:03.812
No!

01:20:02.803 --> 01:20:03.636
Why?

01:20:09.132 --> 01:20:11.215
What do you want from me?

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.280
I can hear the camera, you know.

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:30.773
I know you can hear me.

01:20:34.047 --> 01:20:35.147
I know you can see me.

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.190
So what do you want from me, huh?

01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:50.095
What the fuck do you
want, you fucking perv?

01:20:58.534 --> 01:20:59.705
Huh?

01:21:01.337 --> 01:21:03.582
You cannot keep me here forever!

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.583
You keep me here forever!

01:22:27.601 --> 01:22:28.914
I can do it myself.

01:24:07.215 --> 01:24:08.548
One, two, three.

01:24:11.191 --> 01:24:12.620
What do I do? Four.

01:24:12.622 --> 01:24:14.278
What do I do? Five.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.950
What do you want from me? Six.

01:24:15.952 --> 01:24:17.064
What do you want from me? Seven.

01:24:17.066 --> 01:24:18.132
What do you want from me?

01:24:20.815 --> 01:24:21.648
Nine, 10.

01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:25.476
What happened? 12.

01:24:27.484 --> 01:24:30.384
13, 14.

01:24:30.386 --> 01:24:31.999
Get out of here. 15.

01:24:32.001 --> 01:24:34.334
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:24:36.535 --> 01:24:38.034
18.

01:24:38.036 --> 01:24:38.867
19.

01:24:38.869 --> 01:24:40.711
I can't get out! 20.

01:24:40.713 --> 01:24:42.843
21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:15.242
It is over!

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:22.173
Lillian Rouge has endured three months

01:25:22.175 --> 01:25:23.899
in the viewing room.

01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:32.615
How do you feel, Lillian?

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.428
You have made it through.

01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:40.458
You are only minutes away

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:43.703
from finding out whether
you've won $200,000!

01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:49.893
How does that make you feel?

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:57.593
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, well.

01:25:58.630 --> 01:25:59.928
It looks like Lillian's a bit

01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:02.116
caught up for words right now.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.713
Let's take a look back
at how this all started.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.098
This week on "Snare",

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:14.828
aspiring actress and Bakehouse
Employee, Lillian Rouge,

01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:16.298
is thrown in the viewing room

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.243
for her shot at $200,000.

01:26:21.694 --> 01:26:23.378
I nominated Lillian for "Snare"

01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.158
because she has a great personality.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.008
And now the world will
get to know her as I do.

01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:30.768
Plus that extra $200,000 couldn't hurt.

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.618
Lillian won our hearts
from the very beginning

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:37.534
with #bitethatfinger trending worldwide.

01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:39.710
She made us laugh,

01:26:41.011 --> 01:26:44.827
and she made us cry.

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.143
Voting is closed.

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:58.350
I have the results here
on this piece of paper.

01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:01.833
You have voted.

01:27:04.650 --> 01:27:06.943
Is Lillian worth it?

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:15.403
Does she win $200,000?

01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:29.650
The answer is...

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.126
Ladies and gentlemen, yes!

01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:39.608
Lillian wins!

01:27:39.610 --> 01:27:42.558
With an approval rating of 87%,

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.958
Lillian has won all our hearts.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.753
She has now been given
a check for $200,000!

01:27:49.251 --> 01:27:50.790
Congratulations, Lillian.

01:27:50.792 --> 01:27:52.969
May all your dreams come true.

01:27:52.971 --> 01:27:56.669
Thank you once again
for watching, "Snared."

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.778
Okay, Otis. I think I've seen enough.

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.428
I'm gonna gather everything I can

01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:04.678
and head back to the rendezvous point.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.933
There's no way the university
is gonna believe this.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:09.991
Copy.

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:12.663
Be sure and wait for me
at the rendezvous point.

01:28:17.039 --> 01:28:20.162
Executor Corvid, this
is Agent 23 reporting.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.713
Agent 23, deliver your report.

01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:26.568
Click has evaded the century

01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:29.368
and has activated the Sacred Archive.

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.543
Than the original
plan must be activated.

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.078
Leave the planet immediately

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.408
and return to the cabal.

01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:38.453
Additional guardians will be activated.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.078
Are you sure we can't exfiltrate Click?

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.943
That seems like a tremendous
waste of resources.

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:50.388
Consider this a test of faith, 23.

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:51.868
You have your orders.

01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:52.733
Courted out.

01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:55.133
Orders confirmed.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.720
Agent 23, out.

01:29:10.264 --> 01:29:11.796
You know nothing.

01:29:11.798 --> 01:29:14.155
Hell is only a word.

01:29:14.157 --> 01:29:16.490
Reality is much, much worse.

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:50.059
Where we're going, you
won't need eyes to see.
