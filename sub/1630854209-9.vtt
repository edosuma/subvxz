00:01.653 --> 00:02.959
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...

00:02.959 --> 00:04.830
<i>Sandeford. He knows.</i>

00:04.830 --> 00:06.615
<i>So, we gonna get in trouble now?</i>

00:06.615 --> 00:08.051
I just think
we need to cool it.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.053
As long as we ride together,
I got your back.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.316
<i>I've got an Undercover,
Sean Dryden.</i>

00:12.316 --> 00:15.798
<i>Your cops arrested him
on a traffic stop.</i>

00:15.798 --> 00:17.147
I want to get the hell out
of undercover work.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.540
How long's it been?

00:18.540 --> 00:20.629
- Two and a half years.
- That's a long time

00:20.629 --> 00:21.978
to be somebody
other than yourself.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.153
We can team up.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.285
You did good today.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.503
Meantime, what'll you be doing?

00:25.503 --> 00:26.939
Think I'll take my dog

00:26.939 --> 00:28.419
for a walk at the dog park.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.030
I'd like to go up there
with you sometime.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.640
- What kind of dog do you have?
- I don't have a dog,

00:31.640 --> 00:32.902
but I'll get one.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.094
♪ Something told me...

00:51.094 --> 00:53.314
You know, the thing about
<i>Columbo</i> was you saw the murder

00:53.314 --> 00:55.707
in the first five minutes,
so you know who did it.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.231
Then what
was the point?

00:57.231 --> 00:59.581
The point was watching Columbo
figure it out,

00:59.581 --> 01:00.625
and he always did.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.627
Was he like your-your hero?

01:02.627 --> 01:05.239
No, not really. I never
was a fan of the raincoat.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.634
Check engine again?

01:09.634 --> 01:10.896
Yeah, it happens.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.115
Why don't we have
one of the new cars?

01:12.115 --> 01:13.856
What do you care?

01:13.856 --> 01:16.119
The new cars got all kinds
of features on them.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.599
This car has features.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.863
We need to get rid of it.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.692
Get rid of the old cars, soon
they get rid of the old cops.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.259
DISPATCHER [over radio]:
Sector David, we've got

01:25.259 --> 01:27.174
a 10-10, non-responsive male

01:27.174 --> 01:28.610
at 962 Ashford Street,
second floor.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.220
Possible gunshot wound
to the head.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.266
Sector David,
10-4, 'kay.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.226
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.018
You still thinking
about getting a dog?

01:46.018 --> 01:48.151
Definitely.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.110
Any idea what kind
of dog you'd get?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.329
I was thinking maybe one
that doesn't pee on the rug.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.939
Ha.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.508
I'm not sure you should
be seen with me.

01:57.508 --> 02:00.772
Seen by who?
Nobody's here.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.124
Sometimes, people can
come out of nowhere.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.952
Ah, one of the reasons
I want out of, uh,

02:06.952 --> 02:08.563
undercover assignments.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.130
I'm sick of worrying
about things like that.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.089
Any idea whether
they'll let you out?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.743
Not anytime soon.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.703
My boss at the DEA
hates me right now,

02:18.703 --> 02:20.618
thanks to you.
Mm-hmm.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.925
I was under the impression
you went into the operation

02:22.925 --> 02:25.232
because you wanted to.
Am I mistaken, or...?

02:25.232 --> 02:27.016
- No, no, I'm glad I did.
- Right.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.278
Shut down some drug dealers,

02:28.278 --> 02:30.193
got a lot of fentanyl
off the street,

02:30.193 --> 02:31.586
possibly impressed you

02:31.586 --> 02:34.154
with how skillfully
I infiltrated Oh.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.459
a criminal organization.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.287
You impressed me
a little.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.984
A little.
All right.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.727
Who's that?
Oh, my goodness.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.033
Haywood.
Hey.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.427
Yeah.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.732
Who's a good girl?

02:47.732 --> 02:49.604
What's the address?

03:02.878 --> 03:05.054
And, uh,
what's Remy's last name.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.622
Taylor. Remy Taylor.

03:07.622 --> 03:10.233
And, um, when did you last
talk to him?

03:10.233 --> 03:12.322
About 7:30 this morning.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.455
I was visiting my mother
up in Kingston.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.284
I told Remy
I was on my way back.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.156
- How did he sound?
- Fine.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.245
Normal, like he always sounded.

03:22.245 --> 03:25.161
So, he didn't say anything about
hurting himself, in other words?

03:26.162 --> 03:27.337
No.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.209
I mean,

03:29.209 --> 03:32.342
he complained I hadn't been here
to make him dinner last night,

03:32.342 --> 03:34.562
but he always complained
about that.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.260
Well, we're very sorry

03:37.260 --> 03:39.436
for your loss, Annika.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.872
Can I say goodbye?

03:40.872 --> 03:43.092
Now wouldn't be a good time.

03:43.092 --> 03:46.748
Why don't you
follow these gentlemen.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.233
My Remy.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.017
Ma'am.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.108
What do we know?

04:00.457 --> 04:02.024
Name's Remy Taylor.

04:02.024 --> 04:05.375
Was a detective, retired
from homicide at the 7-4.

04:05.375 --> 04:09.292
Yeah, it looks like a single
gunshot wound to the head.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.685
So many cop suicides,

04:10.685 --> 04:12.948
almost feels like
an occupational hazard.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.993
Well, when you're
thinking about it,

04:14.993 --> 04:16.473
the means are always
within reach.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.693
Well, no suicide note,

04:18.693 --> 04:21.173
there's no stippling
near the entry wound.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.697
Make sure
you bag his hands.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.874
Oh, he had tickets to the
Nets game tomorrow night.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.356
You check his phone?

04:37.929 --> 04:40.715
No, uh, search warrant
necessary, huh, Inspector?

04:40.715 --> 04:42.934
No, Detective,
not when they're dead.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.028
Got it.

05:00.212 --> 05:02.432
We're gonna get this car
situation straightened out.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.391
All the money in this city,
I don't want to be riding around

05:04.391 --> 05:06.088
looking at
a "check oil" light.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.437
Car died on us.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.352
We need a different car.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.355
So, why do you think it is that
so many cops kill themselves?

05:13.748 --> 05:15.793
Probably, uh...

05:15.793 --> 05:18.492
financial problems enter into it
with a lot of them.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.276
Lots of people have
financial problems

05:20.276 --> 05:21.408
and don't kill themselves.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.713
The guy we just saw?

05:22.713 --> 05:24.280
Mm-hmm.
He was a detective

05:24.280 --> 05:25.890
when detectives
had it good.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.501
Wore a suit and tie,

05:27.501 --> 05:28.937
got dry-cleaned
for free.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.417
Went to nice restaurants,

05:30.417 --> 05:31.809
never had to put his hand
in his pocket.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.158
So, then, he retires,
and he has to pay

05:33.158 --> 05:34.464
for his dry cleaning--
that enough

05:34.464 --> 05:35.770
to make him blow
his brains out?

05:35.770 --> 05:36.814
No, these guys
don't think of themselves

05:36.814 --> 05:37.902
like everybody else.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.339
As long as they
were out there

05:39.339 --> 05:40.688
hunting criminals,

05:40.688 --> 05:42.429
they thought of themselves
as heroes.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.127
But, once they stop
hunting criminals,

05:45.127 --> 05:47.608
stop thinking
of themselves as heroes,

05:47.608 --> 05:49.610
then the world
start looking at them

05:49.610 --> 05:51.089
exactly like
everybody else.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.570
And they can't stand it.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.139
I'm-a find Yenko.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.359
We gonna straighten
this car thing out.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.154
- Here's that file, Mr. Walsh.
- Thanks, Kathy.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.504
Um, you know,
why don't you and Jerry

06:14.504 --> 06:16.158
take the rest of the day off.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.247
Okay. Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry.

06:18.247 --> 06:21.032
19 years.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.208
He sat right there.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.775
You and Remy
were on the job together?

06:24.775 --> 06:27.125
On the job together,
off the job together.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.389
I just can't get my head around
that he would do this.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.870
So, there was no warning signs,

06:32.870 --> 06:34.568
- no pleas for help?
- Let me tell you something.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.397
Forget about what
the job is now.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.702
When we were
on the job,

06:38.702 --> 06:40.356
we were on top
of the world.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.792
Remy just couldn't
accept that

06:41.792 --> 06:43.359
that part of his
life was over.

06:43.359 --> 06:44.708
That we're dinosaurs.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.841
Having been
a detective yourself,

06:46.841 --> 06:49.583
I'm sure you know that people
that kill themselves often

06:49.583 --> 06:51.628
tell others that's what
they're planning on doing.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.022
Mm, in retrospect,
Remy probably did, too.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.458
At which point,

06:55.458 --> 06:57.155
I would've told him
what I tell myself,

06:57.155 --> 06:58.418
have a nice meal,

06:58.418 --> 07:00.420
find some female companionship,

07:00.420 --> 07:01.551
turn on the TV,

07:01.551 --> 07:02.987
go to sleep.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.380
Well, looks like you two

07:04.380 --> 07:06.382
built a pretty successful
business, though.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.731
We struggled at first,

07:07.731 --> 07:09.690
but then we got it
off the ground.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.735
And you work primarily for who?

07:11.735 --> 07:14.825
Starting out, we ran, uh,
employee profiles,

07:14.825 --> 07:16.784
uh, coordinated security
for store openings.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.308
Then we got to working
for building management.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.963
Handling evictions,
situations with problem tenants,

07:21.963 --> 07:23.747
uh, that kind of thing.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.314
Vince Carter?

07:25.314 --> 07:27.621
Yeah. We supplied him

07:27.621 --> 07:29.449
with body men
back in the day.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.886
On the slim chance that Remy
didn't kill himself,

07:31.886 --> 07:34.410
I mean, can you think of anyone
that might've had a motive

07:34.410 --> 07:36.325
- for killing him.
- Not really.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.718
I mean, he didn't have
any enemies

07:37.718 --> 07:39.197
that I knew of,
uh, didn't put himself

07:39.197 --> 07:41.286
in risky situations.

07:42.331 --> 07:45.247
I think he just checked out
'cause he wanted to check out.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.908
<i>So, what's the problem
with your car again?</i>

07:53.908 --> 07:56.432
I don't know, Captain.
Something about the exhaust.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.520
I dropped it off at the shop.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.956
I'll see what I have available.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.828
How about one
of the new ones?

08:00.828 --> 08:02.003
He's fixated on this
for some reason.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.308
It doesn't have to be

08:03.308 --> 08:04.919
- one of the new ones.
- No, no, no, no, no.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.051
As one who was fixated
on a Chrysler Cordoba,

08:07.051 --> 08:08.879
and I had my eye

08:08.879 --> 08:10.968
on a mid-'60s Tri-Power Pontiac

08:10.968 --> 08:13.536
with eight-lug wheels,
I understand.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.060
Besides, you don't want some
beater from the motor pool.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.279
You want a new car, right?

08:17.279 --> 08:18.933
- He doesn't.
- Ooh, look what

08:18.933 --> 08:21.196
just became available.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.806
Space 14.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.460
- Seriously?
- Midnight Tour

08:24.460 --> 08:26.244
had it last night,
other than that,

08:26.244 --> 08:27.811
right off the showroom floor.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.552
Just keep it nice and tidy,

08:29.552 --> 08:31.380
you understand?
Who you think
you're talking to?

08:31.380 --> 08:32.903
I forgot,

08:32.903 --> 08:34.514
you're the last person
I got to worry about.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.167
Thank you, Captain.
This is fantastic.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.473
I'm gonna go check out
the features

08:37.473 --> 08:39.649
before we head out.

08:39.649 --> 08:40.737
Hey.

08:40.737 --> 08:43.566
We young guys, we like cars.

08:47.701 --> 08:49.050
You know what
I was excited about

08:49.050 --> 08:50.486
- the last time I changed cars?
- Huh?

08:50.486 --> 08:51.748
Power windows.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.576
Not having to crank
the handle.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.317
- Are you trying to sound old?
- Let me tell you something else.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.145
I'm not taking a course
in computer programing

08:57.145 --> 08:58.363
just so I could operate
the windshield wipers.

08:58.363 --> 09:00.322
What's wrong with this?

09:02.063 --> 09:03.847
It's nice. Yup.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.853
Why does it smell
like that, though?

09:13.248 --> 09:15.380
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.558
Oh.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.343
Oh...

09:23.824 --> 09:25.347
Where you going?

09:25.347 --> 09:28.089
Gonna see which slobs it was
who were in this car.

09:32.441 --> 09:35.313
I can't believe you had
your confidential informant

09:35.313 --> 09:36.924
go all the way
to Red Hook

09:36.924 --> 09:38.403
to bring us these.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.624
Hey, when you have
a hero from Defonte's,

09:41.624 --> 09:43.844
you won't care what
it took to get here.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.498
I was looking over the crime
scene photographs of the gun.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.804
The cylinder swung

09:47.804 --> 09:49.458
to the right,
meaning it was for a lefty.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.547
His girlfriend
said he was a lefty.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.071
And the entry wound
was on the left side, so

09:54.071 --> 09:55.856
all that points
to suicide.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.206
Well, what's Remy Taylor been up
to since he retired off the job?

09:58.206 --> 10:00.730
Well, he started a security
and property management

10:00.730 --> 10:02.166
business with his
ex-partner.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.777
We spoke with him this morning.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.430
Okay, let's talk to
the girlfriend again

10:05.430 --> 10:07.215
from the angle
of a homicide.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.738
What... what, you thinking
nobody ever killed themselves

10:08.738 --> 10:10.392
if they had tickets
to the Barclays Center?

10:10.392 --> 10:11.654
Tickets to
the Barclays Center,

10:11.654 --> 10:12.960
no suicide note,

10:12.960 --> 10:15.440
no stifling near
the entry wound.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.225
Unless we hear otherwise,

10:17.225 --> 10:20.184
treat this like a murder.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.317
What smells so good?
What is that?

10:22.317 --> 10:24.406
Oh.

10:24.406 --> 10:27.583
Uh, this one is eggplant,
and that one is,

10:27.583 --> 10:29.846
uh, shrimp parm. Here,
go ahead, have-have half.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.674
No, that's all right.
Where'd you get them from?

10:31.674 --> 10:33.894
Just, um, a local place.

10:33.894 --> 10:34.982
Some other time.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.853
All right.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.640
I don't think she'd have
a problem with your CI

10:40.640 --> 10:42.903
going all the way to Red Hook
to bring us lunch.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.819
- Like, not at all.
- None for you.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.386
Whatever, man-child.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.568
Ah, look at that.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.048
One of them was smoking.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.049
They're not allowed
to do that, are they?

10:59.049 --> 11:00.224
I'll kill them.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.312
Men.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.879
How's it going, Chief?

11:02.879 --> 11:05.926
Great. Bentley.
Yes, sir.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.974
Chief Suarez, Sergeant said
you were out here.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.020
Oh, yeah. Making my rounds,

11:13.020 --> 11:15.196
- getting some gas.
- You heard about the
get-together for Remy Taylor?

11:15.196 --> 11:18.416
- Yeah. Y-You gonna be there?
- Out of respect.

11:18.416 --> 11:21.811
Retired cop dies in my precinct,
seems only right.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.379
All right, maybe
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.514
These are beautiful photos
of you and Remy.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.125
We met at an AA meeting.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.257
Remy had 17 years.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.824
I was working
on 30 days.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.522
Is there any chance
he started drinking again?

11:37.522 --> 11:40.134
There's always a chance.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.396
That's why they
tell you at meetings

11:41.396 --> 11:43.006
to keep coming back.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.139
- But I would've known.
- Do you know if he was

11:45.139 --> 11:46.706
mixed up in anything

11:46.706 --> 11:47.968
that might've gone bad?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.099
Like what?

11:49.099 --> 11:50.622
Business dealings.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.059
You know, was there someone

11:52.059 --> 11:53.974
who might've held
a grudge against him?

11:53.974 --> 11:56.019
Wait a minute, you think
he maybe didn't kill himself?

11:56.019 --> 11:57.934
Mm, we have to allow
for that possibility.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.284
Oh, my God.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.940
Well, I have to
tell you,

12:03.940 --> 12:05.812
even though he's gone
from me either way,

12:05.812 --> 12:07.204
it makes a world
of difference.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.163
It was Remy
who got me

12:09.163 --> 12:11.643
to stop drinking and using
and slowly killing myself,

12:11.643 --> 12:15.125
and the thought
that he would kill himself

12:15.125 --> 12:17.519
is unbearable.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.435
Were there problems
with anyone at work

12:20.435 --> 12:23.220
that might've led
to someone getting violent?

12:23.220 --> 12:24.874
I mean...

12:24.874 --> 12:27.790
you don't win any popularity
contests evicting people.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.750
I mean,
getting violent, though?

12:32.708 --> 12:35.276
About a week ago,

12:35.276 --> 12:37.757
this guy, uh...

12:37.757 --> 12:40.803
Ricky Velasquez
came to the house

12:40.803 --> 12:42.805
'cause Remy had evicted
him and his family.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.155
I-I wouldn't say
he got violent, though.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.201
Did he make any threats
when he was here?

12:47.201 --> 12:49.029
I mean, what I've
been through in my life,

12:49.029 --> 12:50.291
I don't get threatened
that easy.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.727
Did he make
what most people

12:51.727 --> 12:54.251
would consider a threat?

12:54.251 --> 12:55.557
Yeah.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.819
You know where
we might find him?

12:56.819 --> 12:58.299
I-I think he worked

12:58.299 --> 12:59.996
as a mechanic someplace
in East New York.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.345
I remember Remy

13:01.345 --> 13:02.999
went over there,
and when he came home,

13:02.999 --> 13:05.523
he said he wished he was
repossessing the guy's Harley

13:05.523 --> 13:07.699
so we could both
go for a ride on it.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.095
We never got to do that.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.606
Detective Killian,
7-4 squad.

13:44.606 --> 13:47.391
Does the name "Remy Taylor"
ring a bell?

13:47.391 --> 13:48.784
Nope.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.960
This guy.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.876
One of the scumbags
who evicted us.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.618
If you paid your rent on time,
maybe that

13:56.618 --> 13:58.881
- wouldn't have happened.
- You come here
to aggravate me or what?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.883
I came here because Remy Taylor
might've been murdered.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.363
Are you thinking I had
something to do with it?

14:02.363 --> 14:03.712
I'm asking questions.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.670
I wouldn't have minded
killing him.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.933
Not sorry he's dead,

14:06.933 --> 14:08.935
but I didn't do it. Ah.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.414
You did go to his house, though.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.286
He threw my wife's clothes
on the street.

14:12.286 --> 14:13.591
He put my kid's bed on the curb.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.332
Are you telling me
that there was

14:15.332 --> 14:17.508
no other way to do it?
That that was necessary?

14:17.508 --> 14:18.901
I can absolutely understand

14:18.901 --> 14:20.033
why you'd be mad enough
to kill the guy.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.251
I'd be mad enough, too.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.818
I fell behindon rent,

14:22.818 --> 14:23.906
had to pay off
some gambling debts.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.690
I don't make excuses about it,

14:25.690 --> 14:27.823
but he could've came to me like
a gentleman, and we would've

14:27.823 --> 14:29.303
- worked it out.
- Where were you today, Ricky?

14:29.303 --> 14:30.826
I was at my sister-in-law's
in the Bronx,

14:30.826 --> 14:32.306
sleeping on an air mattress
on the floor.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.394
Oh, so sad.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.656
I was telling you where I was.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.265
That's what
you asked, right?

14:35.265 --> 14:36.701
Keep going.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.573
I took the 5 Train
down to 14th Street,

14:38.573 --> 14:40.401
changed to the L,
got off on Sutter,

14:40.401 --> 14:42.403
then walked here and went to
work. I've been at work all day.

14:42.403 --> 14:45.014
You got somebody
- who can vouch for that?
- Yeah.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.755
My boss, who's bike this is.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.540
Well, I'm gonna need all
their names and phone numbers.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.891
- You got it, Chief.
- Okay.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.939
Navigation, directions

14:56.939 --> 14:59.115
to Stanley
and Fountain.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.726
Determining route. Turn left

15:01.726 --> 15:03.946
- at second light.
- This is like <i>Knight Rider.</i>

15:03.946 --> 15:05.643
What's that?

15:05.643 --> 15:07.297
Another television show you
haven't seen, apparently.

15:07.297 --> 15:08.908
You've never used
voice-assisted GPS before?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.432
No, believe it or not,
I never did.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.434
- It's a real game-changer.
- From what to what?

15:13.434 --> 15:15.610
Try it. G-Give it a command.

15:15.610 --> 15:18.569
Doesn't even have to be
an address. Anything.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.223
Miss Navigation, please.

15:20.223 --> 15:21.529
Just-just-just

15:21.529 --> 15:23.096
Navigation.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.053
Where would you like to go?

15:24.053 --> 15:26.403
The post office.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.623
Be-be a little more specific.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.277
Well, the East New York
post office.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.453
In 500 feet, prepare

15:32.453 --> 15:33.976
to turn left on Pitkin Avenue.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.804
No, that's wrong.
I-I wouldn't go that way, see.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.501
No, no, straight up Livonia,
just five minutes.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.727
Remy liked talking on the phone.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.468
He called the woman
he lived with,

15:47.468 --> 15:48.991
he called his office,

15:48.991 --> 15:50.558
he called Kurt Walsh's
cell phone,

15:50.558 --> 15:51.994
and he called this guy.

15:51.994 --> 15:52.995
What guy?

15:52.995 --> 15:54.562
Antoine Jordan.

15:54.562 --> 15:57.173
There's an Antoine Jordan
who has a podcast.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.305
Yeah, he's out
of East New York.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.871
According to
Remy's planner,

15:59.871 --> 16:02.004
he met with an Antoine Jordan
two weeks ago

16:02.004 --> 16:04.006
and was scheduled
to meet with him again.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.921
Opinionated, radical,

16:05.921 --> 16:07.662
commentary we would all
take issue with.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.577
Why was Remy Taylor
meeting with him again?

16:09.577 --> 16:12.623
Maybe he was gonna do another
interview for the podcast.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.669
Maybe someone wanted
to make sure that didn't happen.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.775
I help you?

16:33.775 --> 16:35.690
- Antoine Jordan?
- Yeah.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.519
Detective Killian, 7-4 squad.
I'd like to talk to you.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.478
About what?

16:41.478 --> 16:43.828
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like to do it

16:43.828 --> 16:45.743
- back at the precinct.
- Am I under arrest?

16:45.743 --> 16:47.310
- No.
- So, I don't have to

16:47.310 --> 16:48.529
go back to the precinct.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.052
Uh, no, I guess you don't.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.402
You just like the idea
that it'd be on your turf

16:52.402 --> 16:54.752
because that's the kind
of power trip you're on.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.755
No, actually,
I'd be asking you things

16:57.755 --> 16:59.322
of a confidential nature,

16:59.322 --> 17:01.020
and I'd like
to not be overheard.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.109
You want to talk to me
about Remy Taylor.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.501
You're right.

17:04.501 --> 17:05.502
He had a lot to say about
the way it was

17:05.502 --> 17:07.026
back in the '80s and '90s.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.202
Talked about how they'd
"tune up a perp."

17:09.202 --> 17:12.031
Said when they were
working out the 7-4,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.684
sometimes they'd throw
the mouthy ones

17:13.684 --> 17:15.034
down a flight of stairs.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.165
Remy promised
to give me

17:16.165 --> 17:17.210
a tour of the precinct

17:17.210 --> 17:18.689
and show me those stairs.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.475
Well, come back there with me,

17:21.475 --> 17:22.780
I'll give you the tour.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.763
Hey.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.244
I, uh, just heard
from crime scene.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.289
Based on the trajectory
of the bullet,

17:53.289 --> 17:55.726
Remy Taylor
did not kill himself.

17:55.726 --> 17:59.817
Crime scene's calling you
directly with that information?

17:59.817 --> 18:02.081
At my request.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.171
This guy was in narcotics
in the '80s and '90s.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.434
Whether he killed himself
or not,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.131
there are a lot of cops
from back then

18:09.131 --> 18:10.437
who are nervous about why.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.613
I'm-I'm sorry, excuse me?

18:12.613 --> 18:14.571
Are you Regina Haywood?

18:15.572 --> 18:17.183
I am.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.185
I'm sure you don't remember me.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.448
Um, I'm Denise Walsh.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.145
You're Mo Haywood's daughter.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.104
- Right.
- Right, so he worked
with my father.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.671
My father's Kurt Walsh.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.586
Oh, yes, of course.
I remember your father.

18:29.586 --> 18:34.025
How well did you know
Remy Taylor?

18:34.025 --> 18:36.158
Very well.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.074
- He was like my uncle.
- Oh.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.728
I mean, he and my father
were like brothers.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.469
So...

18:42.469 --> 18:44.427
Sorry, how-how well
did you know him?

18:44.427 --> 18:45.950
Oh, I didn't know him.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.431
Unfortunately, he died
in the 7-4 precinct

18:48.431 --> 18:49.911
where I'm
the commanding officer.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.741
These old-school guys--
you know, like,

18:53.741 --> 18:56.439
like my father,
like your father, like Remy--

18:56.439 --> 18:59.703
they just keep
everything... inside

18:59.703 --> 19:01.923
until the pressure just
gets to be too much.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.751
You won't believe this,

19:03.751 --> 19:05.927
but I actually convinced my
father to go and see somebody.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.321
- Like a shrink?
- No, like a, just a counselor.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.932
More like a life coach.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.195
My dad agreed and I set up
an appointment.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.371
And then of course when
it is actually time to go,

19:15.371 --> 19:17.330
to the appointment
this morning he says,

19:17.330 --> 19:18.679
"No, I'm too busy,"
and I ended up

19:18.679 --> 19:19.984
having to reschedule
the whole thing.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.116
Well, I'm surprised
you got him to go

19:21.116 --> 19:22.204
in the first place.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.206
Yeah.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.816
He just never complains.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.210
Never says nothing
to nobody.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.821
Just carries the whole
world on his back.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.911
Uh, thank you all
for being here.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.391
Detective.
Oh!

19:35.391 --> 19:37.001
How you doing, Chief?

19:37.001 --> 19:38.046
Sorry for your trouble.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.613
Thank you.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.745
Remy was one of the good ones.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.444
That he was. Share a memory.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.315
Mm.
How recently had you
talked to him?

19:46.315 --> 19:48.317
I talked to him every day.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.014
Stopped coming
to the office, but

19:50.014 --> 19:51.755
I called him
every morning,

19:51.755 --> 19:54.236
if there was an Islanders game
or the Jets or... Yeah.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.631
I heard something that
I thought would make him laugh.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.024
Then he started
going downhill.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.504
What, physically?

20:01.504 --> 20:04.377
I don't know if it was
Alzheimer's or what it was,

20:04.377 --> 20:07.467
but Remy,
he just wasn't the same.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.208
Hmm.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.558
♪ The good times,
the bad times forever ♪

20:11.558 --> 20:14.343
♪ The good times.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.351
Hi.
You smell good.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.961
So do you.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.267
I talked to our union delegate
about what would happen

20:25.267 --> 20:26.529
if someone found out
about us.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.618
Found out about what, Andre?

20:28.618 --> 20:30.098
He said we wouldn't
necessarily get in trouble,

20:30.098 --> 20:31.360
but one of us
might be transferred.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.666
You're not worried
that the delegate

20:32.666 --> 20:34.145
might be the one
to spread it around?

20:34.145 --> 20:35.451
Well, obviously I didn't
give him our real names.

20:35.451 --> 20:36.583
Well, obviously.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.326
- Wow.
- Bentley how's the new ride?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.762
Good, excellent, great.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.329
Brandy.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.766
Sarge.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.812
- That was a close call.
- Yeah.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.858
- Not the first time.
- Right, 'cause you think
Sandeford caught us.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.512
You can never be sure
with Sandeford.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.078
Would you rather
declare a moratorium?

20:54.078 --> 20:55.689
Moratorium on what?

20:56.777 --> 20:58.257
Touching.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.475
No, we can touch.

20:59.475 --> 21:01.172
I think we better not.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.392
Ooh.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.269
You know, the only thing
that doesn't make sense

21:10.269 --> 21:11.661
is that Remy was a cop.

21:11.661 --> 21:12.880
For the life of me,
I can't understand

21:12.880 --> 21:14.316
why he'd be talking
to a cop hater.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.796
I don't hate all cops.

21:15.796 --> 21:16.971
You sure do hate
a lot of them.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.364
You want to talk about why?

21:18.364 --> 21:20.627
'Cause we're racist, homophobic,

21:20.627 --> 21:22.672
only interested in protecting

21:22.672 --> 21:24.283
rich white privilege--
am I close?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.806
You think by saying
it like a joke

21:25.806 --> 21:27.373
you make it less true?

21:27.373 --> 21:28.765
Yeah, I'd like to hear the
interview you did with him.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.158
Check the website.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.508
I post a schedule
of upcoming episodes.

21:32.508 --> 21:33.596
Could always get
a search warrant.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.468
So get one.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.252
I get a search warrant,

21:37.252 --> 21:39.733
I'll turn
that studio upside down.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.692
You're all about
the threat, right?

21:42.692 --> 21:44.999
If it's not a flight of stairs,
it's a search warrant.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.261
What I'm all about,

21:46.261 --> 21:47.915
is investigating
a dead police officer.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.743
Now is that something
that you think the police

21:49.743 --> 21:51.658
should not be doing?

21:53.094 --> 21:56.097
I'm not getting into
a philosophical discussion

21:56.097 --> 21:59.318
in a police precinct,
especially, given its history.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.145
Not this precinct.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.068
All right, we might be wasting
our time with this one.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.331
Maybe not.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.729
How you doing, Antoine?

22:19.729 --> 22:21.340
I'm Regina Haywood.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.387
Deputy Inspector, right?

22:25.387 --> 22:27.171
Very good,
very good.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.782
Most people, they can't identify

22:28.782 --> 22:30.349
rank by uniform.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.699
I spend a lot of time
checking you people out.

22:32.699 --> 22:35.005
I've listened to your podcast.
It shows.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.659
You listen to my podcast?

22:36.659 --> 22:38.400
I want to know what people
in the community think about us.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.794
I don't agree
with a lot of the things

22:40.794 --> 22:43.405
you and your guests say,
but I think

22:43.405 --> 22:45.581
- it's important that I hear them.
- Why is that?

22:45.581 --> 22:47.017
Because you might know
something I don't,

22:47.017 --> 22:48.410
and if you do and it's relevant

22:48.410 --> 22:50.107
to the way I do my job,

22:50.107 --> 22:51.805
then I want
to know them, too.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.415
Mm-hmm.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.722
I take you seriously
as a journalist, Mr. Jordan,

22:55.722 --> 22:59.116
and I don't believe
that the only news gathering

22:59.116 --> 23:02.511
can be done
by mainstream media, so...

23:02.511 --> 23:04.513
and I'm serious about this,

23:04.513 --> 23:06.036
if ever,
in the course of your work,

23:06.036 --> 23:08.648
you want access to me
or my officers,

23:08.648 --> 23:10.867
I would encourage you
to ask for it.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.086
What do you want from me?

23:12.086 --> 23:13.609
Your interview with Remy Taylor.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.918
<i>People have told me</i>

23:17.918 --> 23:20.311
that narcotics detectives
from the 7-4

23:20.311 --> 23:23.358
were regularly shaking down
drug dealers back then.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.751
People told you that?

23:24.751 --> 23:26.230
Urban myth? It didn't happen?

23:26.230 --> 23:28.755
If I told you some
of the things we did.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.017
- Like what?
- It wouldn't shock you to learn

23:30.017 --> 23:31.453
that some of us had girlfriends

23:31.453 --> 23:33.368
- on the side, would it?
- Not really, no.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.283
Or that a certain individual--

23:35.283 --> 23:36.676
whose name I won't mention--

23:36.676 --> 23:38.460
put a gun
in a drug dealer's ear.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.201
Took him for over $100,000 cash

23:40.201 --> 23:42.464
and a white Coupe de Ville which...

23:42.464 --> 23:45.641
he gave to his girlfriend
for Valentine's Day.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.556
Who was the drug dealer?
Do you remember?

23:47.556 --> 23:50.037
Some lowlife getting
rich selling dope's who he was.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.387
And we made them fear us,
you understand?

23:52.387 --> 23:55.042
We'd get out of the car
and they'd scurry like rats.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.522
And because they were

23:56.522 --> 23:58.306
drug dealers,
no one ever pressed charges.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.657
What's that?

24:01.657 --> 24:03.267
No one ever pressed charges

24:03.267 --> 24:04.878
because there were drug dealers.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.445
Oh, Yolo tried.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.968
Threatened to go to the Feds.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.883
Which is why
they fished his body

24:09.883 --> 24:11.841
out of Newtown Creek.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.801
There was a drug dealer in
East New York named Yolo Linden,

24:14.801 --> 24:16.585
who was murderedin 1997.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.195
Body was fished
out of Newtown Creek.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.023
Murder never solved.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.112
Why would Remy Taylor
be talking about it?

24:22.112 --> 24:24.245
Antoine pressed him
to say which cops

24:24.245 --> 24:27.335
Yolo threatened
- to go to the Feds about.
- To single them out by name?

24:27.335 --> 24:30.164
- Remy agreed to do it.
- He made it like it was
a coming attraction.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.209
He said he'd do it next time
he was interviewed.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.734
So if there was no next time?

24:53.056 --> 24:55.581
These were the meds
Remy had prescriptions for?

24:55.581 --> 24:57.408
Yeah. Also that one.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.454
It didn't have a label.

24:59.454 --> 25:02.283
You know, ever since those two
from Manhattan South Homicide

25:02.283 --> 25:04.677
took over our desks,
my chair just hasn't been right.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.679
Walsh told Chief Suarez

25:06.679 --> 25:09.333
that Remy Taylor started
showing signs of dementia.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.554
Antoine Jordan interviewed Remy.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.990
He didn't say anything
like that.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.775
On the other hand,

25:15.775 --> 25:17.559
he wanted to believe
what Remy was telling him

25:17.559 --> 25:18.691
and put it on his podcast.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.910
What do you think, Detective?

25:21.998 --> 25:24.218
I think I'm gonna need
a new chair.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.102
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

25:39.102 --> 25:41.583
If someone was taking
unapproved or bootleg meds

25:41.583 --> 25:44.760
for dementia, would anyone
at the DEA be looking at that?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.327
I doubt it.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.764
But even if they were,
that's not

25:48.764 --> 25:50.461
the kind of thing
I would know anything about.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.422
Okay.
Mm.

25:55.423 --> 25:56.946
Oh, what'd you get?

25:56.946 --> 25:59.688
One sticky bun, one bear claw.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.562
- Which one do you want?
- I don't care.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.563
Have both.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.042
I don't eat sweets.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.175
And you're a vegetarian.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.829
For years.

26:09.829 --> 26:12.266
That's not some undercover
persona you put on? That's real?

26:12.266 --> 26:14.224
That's real.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.879
So what about when you're
hanging out with Authentic

26:16.879 --> 26:19.752
and the Santiagos and them,
and they going out for steak

26:19.752 --> 26:22.537
or ribs or hamburgers.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.191
You tell them
you don't eat meat?

26:24.191 --> 26:25.714
Right.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.847
What about when they
doing drugs?

26:27.847 --> 26:29.370
I tell 'em I don't do drugs.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.198
Which doesn't make
them suspicious.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.330
No, what makes
them suspicious is

26:33.330 --> 26:35.376
when you don't seem genuine.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.204
When I'm with them,

26:37.204 --> 26:38.945
I don't front
like I'm anything I'm not.

26:38.945 --> 26:40.163
Except being a cop.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.733
Except being a cop.

26:48.084 --> 26:50.652
So what about
when you're not with them?

26:50.652 --> 26:53.263
You suspect I'm less
than genuine when I'm with you?

26:53.263 --> 26:55.657
You've lived a double life
long enough for me to wonder.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.704
One thing I can tell you
with absolute sincerity...

26:59.966 --> 27:03.012
...you don't have
to wonder.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.101
Ever.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.644
Okay.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.082
Remy Taylor sat for an interview

27:29.082 --> 27:31.824
with a podcaster
named Antoine Jordan.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.913
He started talking
out of school.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.392
Mm-hmm, saying what?

27:35.392 --> 27:38.874
That a cop killed a CI
named Yolo Linden.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.747
Get you something here?

27:41.747 --> 27:43.574
No, thank you.

27:43.574 --> 27:46.012
I know from the file
Yolo Linden was your CI.

27:46.012 --> 27:48.101
First one.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.060
Yolo.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.584
He was always talking
about that one big score.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.021
That it would be
his last.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.718
He got it in his head

27:56.718 --> 27:59.068
that he was gonna buy a ranch

27:59.068 --> 28:00.591
in Montana,
but this kid, he...

28:00.591 --> 28:02.985
he clearly had never
been west of Jersey City.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.508
His murder never cleared.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.467
Nah, it never did.

28:07.773 --> 28:10.036
So how much was it
out there that Remy Taylor

28:10.036 --> 28:12.038
was talking out of school?

28:12.038 --> 28:13.735
I don't think Remy hid
the fact...

28:13.735 --> 28:15.476
The podcaster listed
the interview

28:15.476 --> 28:17.696
on his website
as a coming attraction.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.176
I'm asking, because if...

28:20.176 --> 28:23.571
part of Remy's dementia was
that he didn't keep it a secret,

28:23.571 --> 28:25.225
the cops that
he was talking about

28:25.225 --> 28:26.835
might've known
that it was gonna air.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.402
I agree. Is there any way

28:28.402 --> 28:31.710
that we can get our hands
on the case file quickly?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.190
See what I can do.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.497
I appreciate it.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.852
Ooh, I'm beat.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.636
What a day.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.203
I don't understand what
we're stopping back here for.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.771
We're stopping back here
so I could illustrate a point.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.034
Those are the guys
that trashed our new car.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.557
How do you know?

28:53.557 --> 28:55.646
Because I know.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.956
Oh! How come you guys

29:00.956 --> 29:02.653
keep trash in your locker?

29:02.653 --> 29:03.916
Somebody put it in there, Sandeford.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.352
Who would do something
like that?

29:05.352 --> 29:07.223
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.182
They didn't even
separate the recycling.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.314
What are you a wise guy?

29:11.314 --> 29:12.751
I'm just trying
to lighten up the mood, man.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.798
Get it?

29:16.798 --> 29:18.191
Got it.

29:18.191 --> 29:19.758
Good.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.458
As per your request.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.069
I decided to bring it over
myself 'cause I want a minimum

29:27.069 --> 29:28.505
amount of people involved.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.246
Hey, Chief.
Oh, what have we got here?

29:30.246 --> 29:32.379
- How you doing, Stan?
- Oh, the Linden case.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.816
You know, I was looking
at that interview

29:34.816 --> 29:37.471
with Remy Taylor, and I couldn't
help but think that

29:37.471 --> 29:40.648
much of it was just the product
of a fevered imagination.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.302
Well, the chief pulled the file

29:42.302 --> 29:45.000
on Yolo Linden's murder
for us to sift through.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.263
It's a lot to go through and
ordinarily I would suggest that

29:47.263 --> 29:49.570
we get a team
of researchers together,

29:49.570 --> 29:51.050
but that would mean more
people. What-what's he doing?

29:51.050 --> 29:53.008
Stan, he's a speed-reader.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.489
He's actually
- reading that?
- No, I'm not reading in the sense

29:55.489 --> 29:57.143
that you curl up with a good
book and savor the writing, but

29:57.143 --> 29:59.623
I have a fairly good retention
rate for names and places,

29:59.623 --> 30:01.147
and that's what
we're looking for, right?

30:01.147 --> 30:02.757
Are any of those names
jumping out at you, Stan?

30:02.757 --> 30:05.151
Remy Taylor, of course,
then there's his partner,

30:05.151 --> 30:07.283
- Kurt Walsh.
- Wh-what's in there
about Walsh?

30:08.241 --> 30:10.896
Yolo was known to drive
a white Coupe de Ville.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.985
And when he was found murdered,
the registration on the car

30:12.985 --> 30:15.814
had been transferred
to a Danielle Luria.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.817
Danielle Luria...
was Kurt Walsh's girlfriend.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.175
I appreciate you
taking the time

30:29.175 --> 30:30.524
to meet with me, Kurt.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.482
You are Mo Haywood's
daughter.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.223
How could I not?

30:34.223 --> 30:36.095
It's so funny to run into you
yesterday after all those years.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.879
I know.

30:37.879 --> 30:40.316
We share a history
together, don't we?

30:40.316 --> 30:42.318
Uh, we got hold of an interview

30:42.318 --> 30:45.974
Remy did with a guy
named Antoine Jordan,

30:45.974 --> 30:48.803
and in the course
of the interview Remy referred

30:48.803 --> 30:51.937
to the murder of a confidential
informant named Yolo Linden.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.940
He said that Yolo
was killed by a cop.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.159
- Huh. I have no idea.
- Are you thinking

30:57.159 --> 30:58.552
that Remy maybe is the cop
that killed him?

30:58.552 --> 31:01.381
Honey... what are you
speculating for?

31:01.381 --> 31:03.687
- We have no idea.
- Well, you were

31:03.687 --> 31:07.691
Remy's partner, I thought
you might have an idea.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.302
Hmm, sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.869
Can I ask where you were

31:10.869 --> 31:12.653
yesterday morning
between the hours

31:12.653 --> 31:14.568
of say, 8:00 a.m. and noon?

31:15.612 --> 31:17.223
What, are you suspecting me
of something?

31:17.223 --> 31:18.615
I'm being thorough.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.837
I was with my daughter, okay?

31:22.837 --> 31:25.753
She's got me going
to some psychologist...

31:25.753 --> 31:29.061
uh, life coach
or whatever they call it.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.890
We were on our way
to his office,

31:31.890 --> 31:33.630
uh, in Wantaugh, right?

31:33.630 --> 31:35.806
Yeah, right, in Wantaugh.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.245
Well, we're in the car,
I get this call

31:39.245 --> 31:41.116
from Annika that...

31:41.116 --> 31:42.639
Remy has died.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.163
Um, needless to say,

31:44.163 --> 31:46.295
I, I canceled the appointment.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.171
Sorry to put you through
all this.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.129
Don't worry.

31:54.129 --> 31:57.654
Uh, it's not like I haven't sat
where you're sitting now.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.569
You got to do

31:59.569 --> 32:02.094
what you got to do,
right, that's all.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.270
Honey, I got to get over
to Starrett City.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.619
Yeah, okay, Daddy.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.795
Hard to believe

32:07.795 --> 32:09.971
Mo Haywood's daughter,
an inspector.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.538
Deputy Inspector.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.975
Ah. Stay safe.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.064
Okay.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.990
I worry about him.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.949
Denise, I'm trying
to square two things

32:30.949 --> 32:33.255
that seem to contradict
each other.

32:33.255 --> 32:34.865
- Yeah, what's that, hon?
- At the bar,

32:34.865 --> 32:37.564
you said your father
canceled the appointment

32:37.564 --> 32:39.914
you made for him
because he was too busy.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.176
God, did I say that?

32:41.176 --> 32:43.048
You know,
I really don't remember.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.964
Just now, he said that
he canceled the appointment

32:45.964 --> 32:47.400
when he got word
Remy was dead.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.749
Right, so what are you saying?

32:48.749 --> 32:51.230
Both those things can't be true.

32:51.230 --> 32:54.015
What is this, is this a whole
interrogation all of a sudden?

32:54.015 --> 32:57.801
No, it's a homicide
investigation, Denise,

32:57.801 --> 32:59.847
and if there are inconsistencies,

32:59.847 --> 33:01.283
they need to be explained.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.981
You know,
I just think it's funny

33:02.981 --> 33:04.895
that both of our fathers
were cops,

33:04.895 --> 33:06.636
and you wanted to follow
in your father's footsteps.

33:06.636 --> 33:09.552
You know, that thought
never even occurred to me.

33:09.552 --> 33:13.165
Are you lying to protect
your father, Denise?

33:13.165 --> 33:15.210
I'm not saying one way
or the other, Regina.

33:15.210 --> 33:18.300
But if I am,
I'm gonna go right on lying.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.389
If you'll excuse me.

33:29.659 --> 33:31.009
Who is it?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.053
Police. Open up.

33:37.493 --> 33:39.800
You called 911?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.149
This guy says
he's coming to kill me.

33:41.149 --> 33:42.368
He knows where I work.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.630
He knows where I live.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.066
He knows
where my girlfriend lives.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.894
Did he say why he
wanted to kill you?

33:46.894 --> 33:49.244
Here.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.072
Listen.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.596
You're gonna broadcast
on your stupid little podcast

33:53.596 --> 33:55.685
what some senile old man
says he remembers

33:55.685 --> 33:58.166
from 25 years ago?
Not gonna happen, babe.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.821
Not if you value your life.

34:00.821 --> 34:04.129
The interview was with a retired
detective named Remy Taylor.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.478
Who we found dead.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.088
You got someplace to go--
relative's,

34:07.088 --> 34:09.090
friend's--
until this gets sorted out?

34:09.090 --> 34:10.874
I guess so.

34:10.874 --> 34:12.702
That's what I'd do, man.

34:12.702 --> 34:14.487
Can y'all stay
until I finish packing?

34:28.022 --> 34:30.198
Do I know you?

34:31.199 --> 34:32.548
I don't know.

34:32.548 --> 34:35.203
You're-you're retired
off the job,

34:35.203 --> 34:36.639
aren't you?
Right.

34:37.858 --> 34:39.294
See, cops have
a certain way of walking.

34:39.294 --> 34:40.730
You can always tell.

34:40.730 --> 34:43.385
Yeah, probably so.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.865
Yeah.

34:46.171 --> 34:48.608
I remember
where I know you from.

34:48.608 --> 34:50.479
You were at the 1-14.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.525
No, man, I was never
- at the 1-14.
- When did you retire?

34:52.525 --> 34:54.092
- 2003.
- And you never

34:54.092 --> 34:55.876
- were never at the 1-14?
- I just told ya.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.226
I was never at the 1-14.
Thank you.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.401
- Hands up against the wall.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:59.401 --> 35:00.794
Hands up.
What are you doing?

35:00.794 --> 35:01.795
I'm a retired detective.

35:01.795 --> 35:04.450
I am licensed to carry.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.365
What the hell
are you doing?

35:06.365 --> 35:08.584
You're not licensed to threaten
to kill people over the phone.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.847
- What are you talking about?
- You have a very
distinctive voice, man.

35:10.847 --> 35:13.720
Let's go.
License to carry.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.681
Okay, let's go.

35:19.900 --> 35:22.163
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
- Good.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.383
I'm gonna take him up
to the squad.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.735
- So how's the new car?
- Good.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.824
So good. Sandeford doesn't know
how to work anything,

35:30.824 --> 35:32.956
but even he seems
happy with it. Yeah. Good.

35:32.956 --> 35:35.916
So Sergeant Kee told me
that they're gonna put me

35:35.916 --> 35:38.005
with a new partner, but
they haven't said who yet.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.181
You tell him
what personality types to avoid?

35:40.181 --> 35:41.922
To avoid?
Yeah.

35:41.922 --> 35:43.880
How about anyone
that's not you?

35:43.880 --> 35:45.665
Look, I don't want
to keep this a secret

35:45.665 --> 35:47.754
any longer
than we need to.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.371
<i>So now I'm a suspect?</i>

35:56.371 --> 35:59.418
You and your daughter's stories
don't line up, Kurt.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.333
It's been a stressful
couple of days.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.813
I-I, I may have missed
a few details...

36:03.813 --> 36:05.554
Yeah, Remy said
the two of you were

36:05.554 --> 36:07.904
shaking down drug dealers,
one of them got sick of it,

36:07.904 --> 36:09.645
threatened to go
to the Feds.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.647
You weren't gonna let
that happen, so you killed him.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.214
Did you rehearse that in front

36:13.214 --> 36:14.911
of your bathroom mirror,
Detective?

36:14.911 --> 36:16.348
Hmm?

36:16.348 --> 36:18.088
I go where the evidence
leads me.

36:18.088 --> 36:19.264
What evidence?

36:19.264 --> 36:20.439
Was your partner making

36:20.439 --> 36:22.136
- all that up?
- First of all,

36:22.136 --> 36:24.530
he offered it up
on some Mickey Mouse

36:24.530 --> 36:26.488
radio show or podcast

36:26.488 --> 36:28.229
or whatever it is, and second

36:28.229 --> 36:30.405
of all, Remy didn't know
whether he was coming or going.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.538
He very well
might've made it up.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.757
So now you're gonna take
what he says as gospel

36:34.757 --> 36:37.151
and use it against me?

36:38.500 --> 36:41.199
Let's see, why don't you, um...

36:41.199 --> 36:43.375
take a look at that.

36:43.375 --> 36:47.205
No one ever pressed charges
because they were drug dealers.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.423
Oh, Yolo tried.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.903
Threatened to go to the Feds.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.340
Which is why
they fished his body

36:52.340 --> 36:54.995
out of Newtown Creek.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.258
Now you might be able
to get away with killing

36:57.258 --> 36:59.478
Yolo Linden. 25-year-old case.

36:59.478 --> 37:02.220
Most of the witnesses are
either dead or in the wind.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.613
But your partner's death,
that's...

37:04.613 --> 37:06.267
that's gonna be
a little tougher.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.834
How long do you think
your daughter's

37:07.834 --> 37:09.618
gonna hold up under
cross-examination?

37:09.618 --> 37:12.012
She's a sweet girl, that Denise.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.492
I don't think
she's gonna last very long

37:13.492 --> 37:14.928
defending Daddy.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.495
She's all you got in the way

37:16.495 --> 37:18.148
- of an alibi, Kurt.
- They'll nail her

37:18.148 --> 37:20.716
for perjury and then you both
end up going away.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.849
Look, I'm sure you have
information on other dirty cops.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.068
Look, work with the D.A.,
the U.S. Attorney.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.896
Maybe they'll go easy on you
when it comes to sentencing.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.508
Yeah, 'cause Remy Taylor,

37:29.508 --> 37:31.814
he couldn't stop going on
about your adventures

37:31.814 --> 37:34.643
back in the day and he
couldn't be trusted to stop.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.515
That was Alzheimer's doing this!

37:36.515 --> 37:38.038
It doesn't matter.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.692
Eventually somebody
would've picked up on it.

37:39.692 --> 37:42.390
The case would've been opened
and then where would you be?

37:42.390 --> 37:44.131
If it was me
that went off my nut,

37:44.131 --> 37:46.916
Remy would've clipped me
without hesitation.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.701
Instead you did it to him!

37:57.187 --> 37:58.754
Yeah.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.410
I did it to him.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.935
You also have to answer
for killing Yolo Linden.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.068
Why, because he was your CI?

38:08.068 --> 38:10.418
Because he was
a human being, Kurt.

38:12.246 --> 38:13.595
All right,
turn around, come on.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.162
Hands behind your back.
Come on, turn around.

38:17.686 --> 38:19.122
All right, yeah?

38:19.122 --> 38:21.037
Let's go.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.567
Guys like that never stop

38:28.567 --> 38:31.004
missing the way it used to be,
do they?

38:32.614 --> 38:35.095
Well, they'd say
they had it good back then.

38:35.095 --> 38:36.357
And what about the rest of us?

38:36.357 --> 38:38.446
Different story.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.323
Yeah, I bet it was.

38:53.374 --> 38:56.072
Must be tough on you buying
your coffee from a bodega.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.726
Why would it be tough
on me?

38:57.726 --> 38:59.380
'Cause you can't
specify what kind

38:59.380 --> 39:01.121
of nut milk you want
to put in it. Why...

39:01.121 --> 39:02.905
Why is what I eat or drink

39:02.905 --> 39:04.254
an issue of such importance
to you, huh?

39:04.254 --> 39:05.473
'Cause I'm your
training officer.

39:05.473 --> 39:06.779
Yeah. what's
that got to do with it?

39:06.779 --> 39:08.128
You're training me
to be a cop.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.521
No, I'm training you
to be like me.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.000
If you're training me
to be like you,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.654
why don't you let me drive
every once in a while?

39:12.654 --> 39:14.656
Think fast.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.745
Ooh! Want to drive?

39:16.745 --> 39:18.181
Let's go. You sitting on
over there all excited.

39:18.181 --> 39:19.357
All right.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.664
♪ Look at me now...

39:22.664 --> 39:25.537
- Who's got it better than us?
- Nobody.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.801
What's up, man?

39:32.892 --> 39:35.590
Bentley! Oh, no.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.200
Oh, no.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.817
10-13, 10-13, my partner's down!

39:44.817 --> 39:46.819
Cop shot,
New Lots and Van Siclen.

39:46.819 --> 39:49.430
Get a bus down here now!

39:49.430 --> 39:51.606
Where you hit?

39:52.651 --> 39:54.174
I'm right here with you.

39:54.174 --> 39:56.350
Stay with me.
I got you.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.004
I'm right here
with you.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.790
I'm right here with you.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.792
Stay with me.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.315
I got you.
