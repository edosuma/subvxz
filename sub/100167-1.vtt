WEBVTT

01:04.711 --> 01:10.282
Leaving this to come see you.

01:10.416 --> 01:12.886
And I can't wait.

01:32.773 --> 01:33.907
Whew.

01:43.582 --> 01:45.085
Taxi! Over here.

01:52.926 --> 01:53.894
Taxi!

01:54.027 --> 01:56.963
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:57.097 --> 02:00.299
Excuse me. Excuse me.

02:20.419 --> 02:21.822
- Gilpin!
- Ahh!

02:21.955 --> 02:24.724
You still on the toothpaste?
Are you on your phone?

02:24.858 --> 02:27.593
I'm just... I'm going home
for the holidays tonight, so...

02:27.727 --> 02:29.196
Does it look like
tonight to you?

02:29.328 --> 02:31.298
Because to me,
it looks like today.

02:31.430 --> 02:34.433
- Finish the toothpaste.
- Okay. Sorry.

03:44.738 --> 03:46.940
Dad, we're home!

03:47.073 --> 03:49.242
I'm in the kitchen!

03:49.376 --> 03:51.410
Jan, Spencer!

03:51.543 --> 03:53.113
In the kitchen!

03:55.382 --> 03:57.717
Dad, are you on a ladder?

03:57.851 --> 03:59.085
- What are you doing?
- Grandpa.

03:59.219 --> 04:00.552
- What's it look like?
- Get down.

04:00.687 --> 04:02.055
I'm changing your light bulb.

04:02.188 --> 04:04.257
I leave for 10 minutes,
you're climbing ladders?

04:04.391 --> 04:06.092
Don't think
you should be doing that.

04:06.226 --> 04:07.961
You think I can't
change a light bulb?

04:08.094 --> 04:10.562
- Okay.
- There.

04:10.697 --> 04:12.699
Ugh! No, no, no.

04:12.832 --> 04:14.533
- I got it. I'm fine.
- Okay.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.567
Hey, kiddo!

04:16.702 --> 04:19.738
Hey, how's New York City?

04:19.873 --> 04:22.608
- It's great.
- How's school?

04:22.742 --> 04:24.778
It's okay. How you doing?

04:24.911 --> 04:27.414
I'm terrific. I don't
even know what I'm doing here.

04:27.546 --> 04:29.115
You're recovering
from hip surgery.

04:29.249 --> 04:31.617
Meh! I'll be out
of here in no time.

04:31.751 --> 04:32.786
It's not a prison.

04:32.919 --> 04:34.553
I wanna get back
to my apartment.

04:34.688 --> 04:37.724
- Is that so terrible?
- Your apartment? It's terrible.

04:37.857 --> 04:39.326
Is it really cold in here?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.294
The downstairs heater
isn't working.

04:41.428 --> 04:44.731
- The guy's coming in the morning.
- It's like a goddamn icebox.

04:45.899 --> 04:47.133
Did you ever call Milo?

04:47.267 --> 04:48.567
What? No.

04:48.702 --> 04:51.137
Dad. He's called five times.
Just call him back.

04:51.271 --> 04:53.807
I'm not calling him back.
I don't wanna talk to him.

04:55.241 --> 04:57.944
Come on, I'll help you
with your bags.

04:59.746 --> 05:01.681
Oh, you're staying in here.

05:01.815 --> 05:03.683
We're roommates.

05:03.817 --> 05:06.652
Yeah. I could just stay
downstairs on the couch.

05:06.786 --> 05:08.855
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- If you want, yeah.

05:08.989 --> 05:10.957
It's a couple weeks.
It's gonna be fine.

05:11.091 --> 05:13.193
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.

05:13.326 --> 05:16.196
- Oh! You're gonna...
- Whoa!

05:18.298 --> 05:20.800
- You okay?
- Don't tell your mother!

05:22.002 --> 05:25.405
This goes there. There.

05:25.537 --> 05:28.074
That's in there.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.210
- All right, let's try it.
- Okay, let's see.

05:30.343 --> 05:32.479
All right, so there's that.

05:32.611 --> 05:34.347
There's this. There's this.

05:34.481 --> 05:37.784
The blue light, the red,
the green light.

05:39.686 --> 05:42.654
Oh, look at you two.
How sweet is this?

05:42.789 --> 05:46.026
Okay, I have to leave for work
before either of you gets up.

05:46.159 --> 05:47.994
The heater guy's
coming in the morning.

05:48.128 --> 05:50.330
I'm gonna meet
my friends for brunch at 10.

05:50.463 --> 05:52.165
That'll be nice.
Where are you going?

05:52.298 --> 05:56.002
- Um... Nora's.
- What are you going there for?

05:56.136 --> 05:57.603
All the restaurants
in Brantford,

05:57.737 --> 05:59.706
- you gotta go to that one?
- I didn't pick.

05:59.839 --> 06:02.175
What difference does it make?
It's been years.

06:02.308 --> 06:04.277
I love you, honey.
I'm so glad you're home.

06:04.411 --> 06:05.678
Love you too, Mom.

06:12.185 --> 06:16.222
Getting old sucks. Don't let
anybody tell you any different.

06:16.356 --> 06:18.858
You still got
that little girlfriend?

06:18.992 --> 06:21.027
No.

06:21.161 --> 06:22.829
We're not together anymore.

06:22.962 --> 06:24.898
I don't think.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.900
Was it her or you?

06:27.033 --> 06:28.802
- It's complicated.
- Try me.

06:28.935 --> 06:31.805
We'll see
if I can understand.

06:31.938 --> 06:36.276
Well, when we
first got together,

06:36.409 --> 06:37.643
we were...

06:39.212 --> 06:42.949
sort of different people
than we are now.

06:44.317 --> 06:46.853
I mean, last year was...

06:46.986 --> 06:48.721
amazing.

06:48.855 --> 06:50.723
I was a senior in high school.

06:50.857 --> 06:52.926
I had a girlfriend.

06:53.059 --> 06:56.930
Like, I finally figured out
who I was or something.

06:57.063 --> 06:59.165
Mm.

06:59.299 --> 07:02.068
I wish I could just feel
like that again, I guess.

07:05.371 --> 07:06.506
I don't know.

07:06.638 --> 07:08.640
Long-distance
relationships are hard.

07:08.775 --> 07:12.745
I mean, I know everybody says
that, but turns out it's true.

07:14.414 --> 07:17.050
Can I give you a little advice?
Listen to me.

07:17.183 --> 07:20.253
Every single day
on every single subway car,

07:20.386 --> 07:22.956
there's lots of ladies
in New York City.

07:23.089 --> 07:27.727
And one in five of them, I would
marry, no questions asked.

07:27.861 --> 07:30.662
This is the best time
of your life.

07:30.797 --> 07:32.966
- It is?
- Yes, it is.

07:33.099 --> 07:36.035
So pull it together! It doesn't
get any better than this.

07:36.169 --> 07:38.972
It's all downhill from here.

08:28.888 --> 08:31.191
Bravestone.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.381
Hi!

09:28.514 --> 09:29.749
Yay, yay, yay!

09:29.882 --> 09:31.317
- Ooh!
- Oh, gosh, how are you?

09:31.451 --> 09:34.220
- Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

09:34.354 --> 09:35.755
Ho, ho, ho!

09:35.888 --> 09:37.557
- Fridge.
- Fridge!

09:37.691 --> 09:39.058
- Come here.
- Ooh!

09:39.192 --> 09:41.661
So we were building houses
for two months,

09:41.794 --> 09:44.230
and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica,

09:44.364 --> 09:46.666
which was also amazing.

09:46.799 --> 09:49.068
That is so awesome.
I am so happy for you.

09:49.202 --> 09:50.770
That is so cool.

09:50.903 --> 09:53.906
So, "M," that's what
we're supposed to call you now?

09:54.040 --> 09:56.309
You don't have to.
It's just a nickname.

09:56.442 --> 09:58.478
One of my college friends
gave me that.

09:58.611 --> 10:00.413
You don't have to call me that.

10:00.546 --> 10:02.582
M. I love it. It's so hot.

10:02.716 --> 10:05.084
- Okay.
- But you and Spencer,

10:05.218 --> 10:08.921
- you're still not...?
- Yeah. No. Um, we're...

10:09.055 --> 10:11.057
We're still,
like, taking a break.

10:12.358 --> 10:14.427
Where is he, by the way?

10:33.413 --> 10:35.315
Eh, Christ.

10:35.448 --> 10:37.718
What do you want, Milo?

10:37.850 --> 10:39.552
Nice to see you too.

10:41.689 --> 10:45.325
Yes, I'd love to come in
for a cup of coffee.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.893
Thanks for asking.

10:52.465 --> 10:54.167
You mind if I make some eggs?

10:54.300 --> 10:55.868
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.

10:56.002 --> 10:58.004
Just hurry up.
I don't have all day.

10:58.137 --> 10:59.539
You going somewhere?

11:02.875 --> 11:04.712
Have, um...?

11:04.844 --> 11:08.614
Have you been in touch
with Spencer much?

11:08.749 --> 11:09.982
Yeah...

11:11.752 --> 11:13.519
You know what?

11:13.653 --> 11:15.154
Not really, actually.

11:15.288 --> 11:18.558
I text him a lot, but
he doesn't always text me back.

11:18.692 --> 11:19.959
- I know.
- It's just...

11:20.093 --> 11:21.627
I've been crazed lately

11:21.762 --> 11:23.963
with, you know,
classes and practices,

11:24.097 --> 11:25.665
and I got games
on the weekends.

11:25.799 --> 11:28.836
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

11:28.968 --> 11:32.740
I've just... I've been... I've
been a little worried about him.

11:35.809 --> 11:39.345
Okay, look, where...?
Where is this guy? For real.

11:43.349 --> 11:44.785
Good?

11:44.917 --> 11:47.788
- Meh.
- What do you mean, "Meh"?

11:47.920 --> 11:50.356
Meh! What do you want already?

11:50.490 --> 11:51.958
You've been calling
and calling.

11:52.091 --> 11:54.527
You show up out of the blue
after 15 years.

11:54.660 --> 11:57.296
Why? 'Cause you wanna
make some eggs?

12:01.901 --> 12:04.303
You remember
when we first opened,

12:04.437 --> 12:08.107
we had that
little dishwasher, Morris?

12:08.241 --> 12:10.009
Yeah, of course
I remember Morris.

12:10.143 --> 12:12.044
Worked the dinner shift.

12:12.178 --> 12:15.783
Six days a week,
2 in the morning most nights.

12:15.915 --> 12:19.952
- The dishwasher.
- Little Morris. Mm.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.890
He wouldn't even touch those
saucepans until he was done

12:23.022 --> 12:26.526
with every single utensil
in the bin.

12:28.194 --> 12:30.596
Yeah, the man knew his craft.

12:31.765 --> 12:33.232
Little Morris.

12:36.737 --> 12:38.337
Well, get... Wha...

12:38.471 --> 12:40.273
Just get to it, would you?

12:40.406 --> 12:42.910
I mean, it's always
the scenic route with you.

12:43.042 --> 12:45.746
I know what you want,
you want to apologize.

12:45.879 --> 12:47.848
And I hate to tell you,
I'm not interested.

12:49.716 --> 12:51.451
You think I'm supposed
to apologize?

12:53.052 --> 12:54.020
Oh, heater guy.

12:56.956 --> 12:59.091
- Grandpa Eddie?
- Anthony?

12:59.225 --> 13:00.293
Yes, sir, it's me.

13:00.426 --> 13:02.161
Anthony!

13:02.295 --> 13:03.429
How are you?

13:03.563 --> 13:05.298
Come on in. Come on in.

13:08.301 --> 13:10.938
- How you doing?
- Oh, getting old sucks.

13:11.070 --> 13:12.940
Don't let anybody
tell you any different.

13:13.072 --> 13:15.909
Heh, heh. Oh, uh, this is
uh, Martha and-and Bethany.

13:16.042 --> 13:17.744
This is Spencer's
grandfather, Eddie.

13:17.878 --> 13:20.413
Martha?
You're the little girlfriend.

13:20.546 --> 13:22.248
- Uh...
- Morning!

13:22.381 --> 13:24.617
Morning, sir.
Sorry to barge in on you.

13:24.751 --> 13:26.986
You're not barging.
He's barging.

13:27.119 --> 13:28.956
Milo Walker.

13:29.088 --> 13:32.291
Wait, Milo? Like...
Like Milo and Eddie's.

13:32.425 --> 13:34.126
- Pleased to meet you.
- Man, my dad said

13:34.260 --> 13:35.796
you guys had
the best restaurant.

13:35.929 --> 13:38.531
We were just there.
Well, it's called Nora's now.

13:38.664 --> 13:42.068
Pfft, Nora's.
It's barely even a restaurant.

13:42.201 --> 13:43.971
It's more like
a breakfast place now.

13:45.973 --> 13:47.540
Were you with Spencer?

13:47.673 --> 13:50.309
No, we came here
looking for him, actually.

13:50.443 --> 13:52.545
You all hungry?
Eggs on the griddle.

13:52.679 --> 13:54.480
- Might have to take a look.
- Hey, man,

13:54.614 --> 13:56.382
you can do more
than take a look at it.

13:56.516 --> 13:58.317
All right, all right. My man.

14:00.653 --> 14:05.558
- Whoa. Do you need a hand?
- Do I look like I need a hand?

14:11.097 --> 14:12.498
Martha?

14:16.269 --> 14:17.303
Hey.

14:19.171 --> 14:21.040
Where is he?

14:30.817 --> 14:33.085
- Do you hear that?
- Yes.

14:38.457 --> 14:40.393
You hear something?

14:40.526 --> 14:42.461
It's probably the heater.
It's broken.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.101
How did it
even get here?

14:49.235 --> 14:50.938
I don't know.

14:51.070 --> 14:52.973
Maybe he...
I don't know,

14:53.105 --> 14:55.374
maybe he went back for it
or something?

14:56.777 --> 14:59.211
Is he trying
to fix it?

14:59.345 --> 15:01.882
Why would anyone
try to fix that thing?

15:02.015 --> 15:03.616
I don't know.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.787
I don't know. Maybe he went
to buy parts or something?

15:06.920 --> 15:08.789
Okay, look,
I'm calling him again.

15:08.922 --> 15:11.959
I'm sure everything's... fine.

15:31.444 --> 15:33.312
Fourteen texts
and four missed calls.

15:36.950 --> 15:38.451
I don't think he went out.

15:40.219 --> 15:41.253
I think...

15:43.122 --> 15:44.691
I think he went back in.

15:44.825 --> 15:47.995
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no...

15:48.160 --> 15:49.195
- What? No. Why...?
- Come on, man!

15:49.328 --> 15:50.496
Why would he do that?

15:50.630 --> 15:52.264
Remember what it was like?

15:52.398 --> 15:54.935
- I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
- I got killed by a piece of cake!

15:55.068 --> 15:56.837
Guys, guys.

15:56.970 --> 15:59.639
How is he gonna get out?

15:59.773 --> 16:03.309
Uh, he's gotta take the...
The green jewel.

16:03.442 --> 16:05.812
And stick it back
in the statue thing.

16:05.946 --> 16:07.047
By himself?

16:22.628 --> 16:23.764
We gotta go get him.

16:23.897 --> 16:25.297
Are you crazy?

16:25.431 --> 16:27.633
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you out of your minds?

16:27.768 --> 16:30.469
We can do this. We've been
there. We know what to expect.

16:30.603 --> 16:32.605
I gotta stop hanging out
with white people.

16:32.739 --> 16:33.940
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

16:34.074 --> 16:36.609
She's right. We played
before and we won.

16:36.743 --> 16:38.177
We barely survived!

16:38.310 --> 16:41.048
You know
he would do it for you.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.149
For any of us.

16:49.522 --> 16:52.159
Be careful.
It looks pretty busted.

16:57.530 --> 16:59.265
<i>Welcome to Jumanji.</i>

16:59.398 --> 17:03.569
What...? We haven't even
picked our guys yet!

17:03.704 --> 17:05.503
What?

17:05.637 --> 17:09.910
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I
hate this part. All right. Okay.

17:12.211 --> 17:14.547
This is not happening!

17:22.055 --> 17:23.824
You guys?

17:27.694 --> 17:28.895
No!

17:47.681 --> 17:49.116
Am I...?

17:49.248 --> 17:51.250
Is it...? I can't believe...

17:52.384 --> 17:54.054
Oh!

17:57.057 --> 17:58.557
Oh, it's her.

17:58.692 --> 17:59.592
I'm her.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.267
Spencer.

18:09.368 --> 18:10.603
Spencer?

18:14.975 --> 18:17.744
What in tarnation?

18:17.878 --> 18:19.813
Where am I?

18:19.946 --> 18:22.448
What the hell is this?

18:22.581 --> 18:25.451
Oh, my God.

18:25.584 --> 18:26.619
Eddie?

18:28.554 --> 18:32.125
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

18:32.259 --> 18:34.261
Milo?

18:34.393 --> 18:35.762
What on earth? What...?

18:36.897 --> 18:37.931
- What the...?
- Oh, my.

18:38.064 --> 18:39.132
Wait a minute.

18:39.266 --> 18:40.734
Oh, Lord.

18:40.867 --> 18:43.136
- This isn't happening.
- Pardon me?

18:43.270 --> 18:46.338
- Who are you?
- You're Spencer's grandfather.

18:46.472 --> 18:49.608
- Yeah, no kidding.
- And you are Milo.

18:49.743 --> 18:51.111
I certainly am.

18:51.244 --> 18:53.379
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

18:53.512 --> 18:55.514
You're the little girlfriend?

18:55.648 --> 18:57.150
- Look out!
- What?

18:58.651 --> 19:01.520
- Ah! Oh, oh!
- Oh, Lord.

19:01.654 --> 19:04.523
That hurt like a goddamn...

19:04.657 --> 19:08.327
- Bethany?
- What? I'm not...

19:08.460 --> 19:10.329
No.

19:10.462 --> 19:14.000
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

19:14.134 --> 19:15.235
Yo!

19:15.367 --> 19:20.207
Oh, no, no, no.
This can't be happening!

19:20.339 --> 19:21.241
Fridge?

19:21.373 --> 19:23.375
Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it!

19:23.509 --> 19:25.477
The hell, man?

19:25.611 --> 19:28.849
Okay.
Okay, something went wrong.

19:28.982 --> 19:29.950
You think?

19:33.186 --> 19:35.288
Holy...

19:35.421 --> 19:37.456
Wait. If I'm...

19:37.590 --> 19:39.658
Then you...? Spencer?

19:39.793 --> 19:42.028
Why does everybody
keep calling me Spencer?

19:42.162 --> 19:46.700
No, that is Grandpa Eddie.
And that, heh... is Milo.

19:46.833 --> 19:48.235
Pleased to meet you.

19:48.367 --> 19:49.870
What?

19:50.003 --> 19:51.972
Then where's Bethany?
And where's Spencer?

19:52.105 --> 19:53.672
I don't know! Okay?

19:53.807 --> 19:56.076
The game, it didn't
let us pick our avatars, so...

19:56.209 --> 19:58.044
- Because it's busted!
- Yeah, okay.

19:58.178 --> 19:59.511
Are we dead?

19:59.645 --> 20:02.282
You know, I was just
wondering the same thing.

20:02.414 --> 20:04.251
Did I die and turn into

20:04.383 --> 20:07.721
some kind of a small,
muscular Boy Scout?

20:07.854 --> 20:10.857
- We're not dead.
- So then what's going on here?

20:10.991 --> 20:13.126
Okay, this is gonna sound
very, uh, strange,

20:13.260 --> 20:16.229
<i>but we are in
a video game called Jumanji,</i>

20:16.363 --> 20:20.867
and we are in the bodies
of video game characters, heh.

20:21.001 --> 20:22.869
And we've been here before,
Fridge and I.

20:23.003 --> 20:24.704
- Last time, I was you.
- Mm.

20:24.838 --> 20:27.439
- Huh?
- We're in a game!

20:27.573 --> 20:29.709
We gotta find Spencer
'cause he's in here too.

20:29.843 --> 20:31.912
- Spencer?
- Yes.

20:32.045 --> 20:33.780
- He's here?
- Yes.

20:33.914 --> 20:35.514
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

20:35.648 --> 20:37.416
Yes. Spencer.

20:37.549 --> 20:39.786
- He's here too?
- Yes!

20:39.920 --> 20:41.420
He's here,
and we gotta find him.

20:41.553 --> 20:43.924
So it's like
a hide-and-go-seek situation.

20:44.991 --> 20:46.525
I'm not "it."

20:46.659 --> 20:47.894
Hm...

20:51.197 --> 20:52.966
My hip feels
pretty good now.

20:55.969 --> 20:58.271
Oh, my joints
feel like butter.

20:59.438 --> 21:01.975
- Oh, yeah, look at those.
- Wow.

21:02.108 --> 21:05.245
Look at these.
Look at what I got.

21:05.378 --> 21:08.748
- Uh, we have some issues here.
- You're telling me this?

21:08.882 --> 21:10.516
I'm the old fat dude.

21:10.649 --> 21:12.786
I came back, and things
actually got worse.

21:12.919 --> 21:14.754
At least last time
I was still black.

21:17.791 --> 21:20.860
Well, look at
this little fella.

21:20.994 --> 21:22.528
Hello there. Heh.

21:22.661 --> 21:24.831
Mr. Walker, don't get
too close to the water!

21:24.965 --> 21:27.834
- Get away from there!
- I'm sorry, what'd you say now?

21:32.272 --> 21:33.974
Hey! Ahh!

21:36.042 --> 21:37.310
Get on out of here!

21:38.979 --> 21:40.180
What just happened?

21:40.313 --> 21:41.681
What the hell
was that thing?

21:44.918 --> 21:51.490
Well, that there
was a hippopotamus. Mm-hm.

21:51.623 --> 21:53.426
And they are awfully fast.

21:53.559 --> 21:56.296
Faster than a horse,
if you can believe that.

21:56.429 --> 21:59.866
And they've got
an awful ferocious bite.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.634
How about that?
You know, the funny thing is,

22:02.769 --> 22:04.904
I don't remember...

22:05.038 --> 22:08.507
knowing much about hippos
until right now.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.043
You're a zoologist.

22:10.176 --> 22:13.847
- I'm sorry, what now?
- Are we in Florida?

22:13.980 --> 22:17.717
Just listen.
This is a dangerous place.

22:17.851 --> 22:19.085
Crazy dangerous.

22:19.219 --> 22:21.187
But Martha and I,
we've been here before.

22:21.321 --> 22:25.557
We know what we're doing. You
gotta stay alert all the time.

22:25.692 --> 22:29.696
If I'm near water, I got one eye
on the water, you hear me?

22:29.829 --> 22:32.232
You got to have eyes
in the back of your...

22:36.836 --> 22:38.670
Oh, God.

22:38.805 --> 22:42.375
What in the Sam Hill
just happened to him?

22:48.148 --> 22:50.350
Shut the front door.

22:50.483 --> 22:51.851
What the hell
happened to you?

22:54.020 --> 22:55.088
Damn!

22:58.191 --> 22:59.192
A plane?

23:00.226 --> 23:03.396
What? Come on! Follow me!

23:03.530 --> 23:05.432
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Follow us.

23:13.773 --> 23:15.574
Welcome to Jumanji.

23:15.708 --> 23:17.811
- Why is he in a plane?
- I don't know.

23:17.944 --> 23:19.979
Well, don't just stand there.
Hop in!

23:24.616 --> 23:26.986
Strap in.
There's no time to spare.

23:30.924 --> 23:33.359
Dr. Bravestone,
famed archeologist

23:33.493 --> 23:35.261
and international explorer,

23:35.395 --> 23:37.063
I'm so glad you've returned.

23:37.197 --> 23:39.866
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

23:39.999 --> 23:41.367
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

23:41.501 --> 23:43.635
Once again, Jumanji
is in great peril,

23:43.770 --> 23:44.971
and only you can help.

23:45.105 --> 23:46.773
Nigel, we're looking
for our friend.

23:46.906 --> 23:49.976
- Have you seen, like, anyone...?
- Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men,

23:50.110 --> 23:51.911
welcome to Jumanji.

23:52.045 --> 23:55.647
- "Killer of men"?
- Yeah, I, uh... I kill guys.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.417
I'm so glad you've returned.

23:57.550 --> 23:59.651
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

23:59.786 --> 24:02.255
- What's with this fella?
- My dearest Mouse,

24:02.388 --> 24:03.690
surely you remember me.

24:03.823 --> 24:05.492
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

24:05.624 --> 24:08.595
Hey. Nigel,
I thought that was you.

24:08.728 --> 24:10.797
He's a... Uh, what is it called?

24:10.930 --> 24:14.134
- NPC, a non-player character.
- He's not a real person.

24:14.267 --> 24:16.870
He only has a limited
number of things he can say.

24:17.003 --> 24:19.506
Mm, my friend Carl
is just like that.

24:19.638 --> 24:21.141
Nigel, we're looking
for someone.

24:21.274 --> 24:22.709
Has anyone arrived
in Jumanji...?

24:22.842 --> 24:24.477
Jumanji is in great peril.

24:24.611 --> 24:27.380
It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.

24:27.514 --> 24:29.782
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.384
Grandpa Eddie.

24:31.518 --> 24:33.786
- Do you have a letter?
- Do I have a letter?

24:33.920 --> 24:36.289
- Check your pockets.
- Why would I have a letter?

24:36.422 --> 24:37.857
Nigel here
wrote you a letter.

24:37.991 --> 24:39.626
I didn't get a letter
from this guy.

24:39.759 --> 24:41.528
But we are
in a video game, and...

24:41.660 --> 24:43.530
We're in a video game?

24:43.662 --> 24:44.697
We're gonna die.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.766
- We did die.
- Are we in hell?

24:46.900 --> 24:48.268
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

24:48.401 --> 24:50.170
It's detailed
in the letter I sent you,

24:50.303 --> 24:52.205
Dr. Bravestone.
You should read it aloud.

24:52.338 --> 24:55.208
I don't have a letter! How many
times I gotta tell you that?

24:55.341 --> 24:57.777
Oh, no, Eddie.
It's in your hand.

24:59.412 --> 25:00.880
Where did this come from?

25:01.014 --> 25:04.117
You got to pay attention
to what's in your hand.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.586
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

25:09.189 --> 25:12.025
"Dr. Bravestone,
it is my solemn hope

25:12.158 --> 25:15.228
that this letter finds you,
for again..."

25:15.361 --> 25:18.998
<i>Jumanji is in grave danger.
We need your help at once.</i>

25:19.132 --> 25:20.934
<i>Whoa, what's going on here?</i>

25:21.067 --> 25:23.236
<i>It's a cutscene.
It's how we find...</i>

25:23.369 --> 25:24.604
<i>I'll explain afterwards.</i>

25:24.737 --> 25:26.439
<i>You see, our worst nightmare</i>

25:26.573 --> 25:27.941
<i>has come to pass,</i>

25:28.074 --> 25:31.077
<i>for Jurgen the Brutal
has returned.</i>

25:31.211 --> 25:34.414
<i>Indeed, that most vicious
Jumanjian conqueror is back.</i>

25:35.582 --> 25:36.749
<i>And he's brought with him</i>

25:36.883 --> 25:38.686
<i>his savage horde.</i>

25:38.818 --> 25:42.555
<i>They descended from their
fortress atop Mount Zhatmire</i>

25:42.690 --> 25:46.694
<i>and made their way south
to the Avian Province,</i>

25:46.826 --> 25:49.429
<i>home of the sacred
Falcon Jewel,</i>

25:49.562 --> 25:51.831
<i>worn around the neck
of the village elder.</i>

25:51.965 --> 25:54.234
<i>The Falcon is
the fertility jewel of Jumanji,</i>

25:54.367 --> 25:56.102
<i>and it has been guarded
by the people</i>

25:56.236 --> 25:59.038
<i>of the Avian Province
for hundreds of years.</i>

25:59.172 --> 26:01.341
<i>So long as the jewel
can see the sun,</i>

26:01.474 --> 26:05.044
<i>the waters will flow
and the land will flourish.</i>

26:11.751 --> 26:13.086
Yeah!

26:21.729 --> 26:24.564
<i>Many brave souls died that day,</i>

26:24.698 --> 26:27.166
<i>but Jurgen got
what he came for.</i>

26:27.300 --> 26:29.602
<i>He stowed the jewel
in darkness,</i>

26:29.737 --> 26:31.404
<i>hidden from the sun.</i>

26:43.349 --> 26:44.951
<i>A drought befell the land.</i>

26:45.084 --> 26:47.153
<i>The crops dried out and died.</i>

26:47.287 --> 26:49.422
<i>And if the jewel
is not returned soon,</i>

26:49.555 --> 26:51.291
<i>it may be too late.</i>

26:51.424 --> 26:52.892
<i>Which is why we called for you</i>

26:53.026 --> 26:54.894
<i>and your brilliant associates.</i>

26:55.028 --> 26:56.629
<i>I understand
the enormous weight</i>

26:56.764 --> 26:58.998
<i>that this must carry for you,
Dr. Bravestone,</i>

26:59.132 --> 27:01.801
<i>how this adventure
is like no other,</i>

27:01.934 --> 27:04.404
<i>since it was Jurgen the Brutal</i>

27:04.537 --> 27:06.740
<i>who killed your parents.</i>

27:09.876 --> 27:11.377
No, no, no, no!

27:13.980 --> 27:15.448
- Huh?
- He killed

27:15.581 --> 27:17.483
- Dr. Bravestone's parents?
- Indeed, he did.

27:17.617 --> 27:20.953
- When the doctor was just a boy.
- Oh, well, that's terrible.

27:21.087 --> 27:23.990
I can't say this enough:
We're in a video game.

27:24.123 --> 27:26.694
You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutal

27:26.826 --> 27:28.294
and show it to the sun.

27:28.428 --> 27:31.164
He's making his way north
across the desert now.

27:31.297 --> 27:34.133
Jurgen the Brutal.
Is that Barbara's boy?

27:34.267 --> 27:36.502
And remember, the goal
is to recover the loot.

27:36.636 --> 27:38.504
To wrest it from
the hands of the brute.

27:38.638 --> 27:40.173
And if you wish
to leave the game,

27:40.306 --> 27:42.608
you must save Jumanji
and call out its name.

27:42.743 --> 27:46.112
Excuse me. Who is Jumanji?

27:46.245 --> 27:49.649
Well, if I was listening
correctly, that is her sister.

27:49.783 --> 27:51.184
Here's your map.

27:52.919 --> 27:55.655
Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit.

27:55.789 --> 27:57.623
- Huh?
- I can't land here,

27:57.758 --> 27:59.325
so you're going
to have to drop in.

27:59.459 --> 28:00.860
- What?
- No, no. Nigel...

28:00.993 --> 28:02.562
- I'll get as low as I can.
- Hold on.

28:02.696 --> 28:04.030
- Get ready.
- What do you mean?

28:04.163 --> 28:05.031
We don't have parachutes.

28:05.164 --> 28:06.466
Shouldn't we have...? Ahh!

28:06.599 --> 28:08.368
- What the hell?
- Good luck.

28:08.501 --> 28:10.336
The future of Jumanji
is in your hands.

28:10.470 --> 28:12.338
Why did we take a plane
if there's nowhere to land?

28:12.472 --> 28:13.539
And go!

28:41.334 --> 28:43.436
The hell, man?

28:54.681 --> 28:55.749
Where are we?

28:55.883 --> 28:57.517
Where's the jungle?

28:57.650 --> 28:59.419
What are we doing here?

28:59.552 --> 29:01.421
We've got to keep it
together, okay?

29:01.554 --> 29:02.890
- "Keep it together"?
- Yes.

29:03.022 --> 29:04.424
This is
a whole new thing.

29:04.557 --> 29:06.693
Nobody said we'd have to do
a whole new thing.

29:06.827 --> 29:09.595
And by the way, what the hell
happened to Bethany?

29:30.082 --> 29:32.618
So, what part of New
Hampshire is this exactly?

29:32.753 --> 29:34.788
We're not
in New Hampshire, Milo.

29:34.922 --> 29:36.824
That's right. Exactly.
Not New Hampshire.

29:36.956 --> 29:38.826
- You're starting to get it now?
- Nope.

29:38.958 --> 29:41.427
I don't have the foggiest clue
what's going on here.

29:41.561 --> 29:43.596
That guy kept calling me
Dr. Braverman,

29:43.730 --> 29:45.364
which is the name
of my orthopedist.

29:45.498 --> 29:47.768
I'm thinking I just had
another hip surgery

29:47.901 --> 29:49.435
and now I'm coming out of it.

29:49.569 --> 29:52.505
Hey! Check this out!

29:57.977 --> 30:00.681
Okay.
We have to find Spencer.

30:00.814 --> 30:03.483
To do that, I think we have
to start playing the game.

30:03.616 --> 30:06.252
I'm sure that's what he did.
We find him,

30:06.385 --> 30:09.088
finish the game,
and we go home.

30:09.222 --> 30:11.624
Ed, you okay?

30:11.758 --> 30:14.527
Would you look at me?

30:14.660 --> 30:16.529
I'm back.

30:16.662 --> 30:18.531
I haven't looked
like this since...

30:18.664 --> 30:19.967
Never.

30:20.099 --> 30:22.168
You looked like this never.

30:22.301 --> 30:24.537
What? When I was younger,
I was in great shape.

30:24.670 --> 30:26.506
I remember you
when you were younger,

30:26.639 --> 30:29.843
and... this is not
what you looked like.

30:29.977 --> 30:32.011
I think my eyes
are a different color.

30:32.144 --> 30:34.380
All of you
is a different color.

30:34.514 --> 30:38.317
It's a good look on me,
huh? Huh?

30:38.451 --> 30:40.721
Okay.
They're headed north.

30:40.854 --> 30:43.089
- Which way is north?
- I have no idea.

30:43.222 --> 30:46.860
- Well, you wanna check the map?
- Right. I'm the map guy now.

30:46.994 --> 30:50.964
"Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit."

30:51.097 --> 30:53.834
Follow the flame
to the desert fruit.

30:53.967 --> 30:55.468
You know there's
nothing on that?

30:55.601 --> 30:56.803
He can see it,
you can't.

30:56.937 --> 30:58.906
Each place on the map
is a different level,

30:59.038 --> 31:01.374
and the levels
get harder as we go.

31:01.507 --> 31:03.409
This one is called...

31:03.543 --> 31:05.578
"Dunes."

31:05.712 --> 31:07.346
No shit.

31:09.716 --> 31:11.885
Who the hell is that?

31:16.622 --> 31:18.992
Oh, that's an ostrich.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.930
- Oh, no.
- Yes, indeed.

31:23.062 --> 31:26.700
That is an ostrich.

31:26.833 --> 31:29.770
The ostrich
is a flightless bird,

31:29.903 --> 31:32.138
one of 60 species.

31:32.271 --> 31:36.208
You got the penguin, you got
the emu, and you got the kiwi.

31:36.342 --> 31:39.245
Heh, heh, funny thing is,
I don't remember knowing...

31:39.378 --> 31:40.914
You're a zoologist.

31:41.048 --> 31:43.082
I was a zoologist last time.
It's important.

31:43.215 --> 31:45.384
Maybe if we could get through
this quicker.

31:45.518 --> 31:50.423
Well, another thing is, they can
run up to 45 miles per hour,

31:50.556 --> 31:54.193
which makes them the world's
fastest two-legged animal.

31:54.327 --> 31:56.930
Did you know that?
Fascinating.

31:58.765 --> 32:02.301
- What a magnificent creature.
- We should get out of here.

32:03.669 --> 32:05.571
What else do you know?

32:05.706 --> 32:07.273
Here's another
interesting fact.

32:08.775 --> 32:11.277
They have three stomachs.
How about that?

32:12.578 --> 32:15.816
Ah! Come on.
Beat it!

32:15.949 --> 32:17.583
Don't get so close.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.988
Just a bird, okay? Come on,
get moving. Get out of here.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.422
- Anything else we need to know?
- Beat it, bird.

32:23.556 --> 32:25.826
Another interesting thing
about the ostrich...

32:25.959 --> 32:27.928
I said scram,
you stupid bird!

32:28.061 --> 32:30.097
- ...is when threatened...
- Get out of here!

32:30.262 --> 32:31.698
...they attack.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.103
Oh, my!

32:38.105 --> 32:39.806
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Oh!

32:39.940 --> 32:42.441
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

32:42.575 --> 32:44.111
- Yes.
- No. Yes, he died,

32:44.243 --> 32:45.979
but he's fine.

32:46.113 --> 32:49.016
Did I just kill Eddie...

32:49.148 --> 32:51.018
by talking too slow...

32:52.585 --> 32:54.087
like he always said
I would?

33:05.331 --> 33:09.201
Why does everybody keep
dropping from the sky?

33:09.335 --> 33:13.639
Nurse, I'm gonna need to see
Dr. Braverman right now, please.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.109
I'm not your nurse.
Okay, listen.

33:16.242 --> 33:20.446
These tattoos on our arms,
that is your life count.

33:20.579 --> 33:21.882
We each have three lives.

33:22.015 --> 33:24.483
You and Fridge
each have two left.

33:24.617 --> 33:26.153
If you lose all three,

33:26.285 --> 33:28.922
listen to me,
it is game over.

33:29.056 --> 33:33.160
- That's it. You're dead.
- Dead like... "kaputski"?

33:33.292 --> 33:34.593
Yes.

33:34.728 --> 33:35.896
Kaputski.

33:41.168 --> 33:42.268
What the hell is that?

33:42.401 --> 33:44.104
- That's not good.
- Look.

33:52.846 --> 33:56.149
Oh, there's one more thing
about ostriches.

33:56.282 --> 33:57.216
Oh, no.

33:57.349 --> 33:58.417
Say it!

33:58.551 --> 34:00.854
They travel in herds.

34:05.892 --> 34:07.493
We gotta get out of here!

34:07.626 --> 34:10.163
- Dune buggies, let's go!
- Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

34:10.295 --> 34:11.797
- Hey, wait.
- Why am I so slow?

34:11.931 --> 34:13.399
Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

34:13.532 --> 34:15.168
- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming, Eddie.

34:15.301 --> 34:17.003
- Go.
- Do you see the key anywhere?

34:17.137 --> 34:19.773
- Okay, how do I do this?
- I've never driven one of these!

34:23.976 --> 34:25.543
Maybe under the dash.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.882
- Green button!
- Green button. Go.

34:29.014 --> 34:29.882
Go, go, go!

34:32.719 --> 34:33.652
Go, go.

34:43.096 --> 34:44.164
Oh, my God!

34:56.943 --> 34:58.044
Go.

34:58.178 --> 35:01.081
You are
a terrible driver.

35:01.214 --> 35:02.983
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

35:03.116 --> 35:05.317
Nobody fine. You... Oh! Oh, oh!

35:06.619 --> 35:08.722
Oh, no! Ahh, ahh!

35:08.855 --> 35:11.091
Oh, help! Oh, oh!

35:11.224 --> 35:13.126
Hold on, Eddie.
Please don't let go.

35:13.260 --> 35:16.129
Ahh! Oh! Oh, wow!

35:16.263 --> 35:17.764
Oh, help. Ahh!

35:24.104 --> 35:26.940
Help. Eddie. Oh!

35:30.309 --> 35:32.279
Beat it!

35:32.411 --> 35:33.546
Get out of here!

35:37.951 --> 35:38.885
I think we lost them.

35:39.019 --> 35:40.020
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:56.203 --> 35:58.071
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:00.807 --> 36:02.042
Oh, no.

36:07.446 --> 36:08.347
- Ahh!
- What do we do?

36:08.480 --> 36:10.183
I don't know!

36:13.920 --> 36:15.689
Get in! Hurry!

36:26.665 --> 36:28.201
Ha! Suckers!

36:35.541 --> 36:36.943
- Eddie...
- Uh-oh.

36:38.912 --> 36:42.349
- Oh, my...
- Whoa, whoa!

36:42.481 --> 36:45.352
- Oh, dude!
- Oh, dear.

36:47.721 --> 36:49.923
What do we do?

36:50.056 --> 36:51.057
What do we do?

36:55.494 --> 36:56.629
What are you doing?

36:56.763 --> 37:00.033
- Birds, birds, birds!
- Birds!

37:07.506 --> 37:10.576
- What the hell, man?
- They're flightless birds.

37:10.710 --> 37:14.080
This is a flightless
dune buggy!

37:14.214 --> 37:16.917
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

37:19.085 --> 37:20.687
No, no, no!

37:20.820 --> 37:23.056
- We're not going to make it.
- We're gonna make it.

37:23.189 --> 37:25.258
- No, we're not!
- We're not gonna make it.

37:25.392 --> 37:26.558
We're gonna make it.

37:32.832 --> 37:34.466
We're not gonna make it.

37:45.111 --> 37:48.748
That was fantastic. Heh.

37:48.882 --> 37:50.449
- Oh, horrible driver.
- Whoo...

37:52.484 --> 37:55.755
Yeah, you see that, birds?
You don't mess with the kid.

37:55.889 --> 37:57.157
Right there!

38:01.460 --> 38:03.029
Did you see me?

38:03.163 --> 38:04.798
I was incredible.

38:04.931 --> 38:07.167
I mean, I saved you,
I saved you,

38:07.300 --> 38:11.738
I saved this guy from a bird
while I was driving a car.

38:11.871 --> 38:14.841
I was a machine.
I was relentless.

38:14.975 --> 38:18.078
- I was fearless.
- Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

38:18.211 --> 38:21.314
That's Bravestone.
Okay, check this out.

38:23.450 --> 38:24.818
Oh, goodness.

38:26.485 --> 38:27.619
What the hell?

38:27.754 --> 38:29.322
It's your strengths
and weaknesses.

38:29.456 --> 38:30.757
I... I mean your avatar,

38:30.890 --> 38:33.793
Dr. Bravestone's,
strengths and weaknesses.

38:33.927 --> 38:35.661
"Fearless," check.

38:35.795 --> 38:38.198
"Speed. Climbing."
"Boomerang"?

38:39.466 --> 38:41.167
"Smoldering intensity"?

38:41.301 --> 38:44.037
- It's this stupid face you make.
- Huh?

38:47.639 --> 38:48.742
There it is.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.912
Ew! Ew! Old man.
Get it together.

38:53.046 --> 38:56.016
Eddie, you okay?
You having a heart attack?

38:56.149 --> 38:58.918
His whole left side is shutting
down. Eddie, look at me!

38:59.052 --> 39:01.653
- Yeah?
- There you go. Now you're back.

39:03.156 --> 39:05.191
"Weakness: switchblade."

39:05.325 --> 39:07.694
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

39:07.827 --> 39:09.863
Bravestone didn't
have weaknesses last time.

39:09.996 --> 39:11.731
Yeah,
bugged the hell out of me.

39:11.865 --> 39:13.400
I wonder if...

39:18.204 --> 39:21.808
- "Nunchucks"? That's new.
- Damn, that's a good list.

39:21.941 --> 39:24.878
Milo, push on your left,
like, chest area.

39:25.011 --> 39:27.747
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come on, man.

39:27.881 --> 39:29.315
Hey!

39:29.449 --> 39:31.518
Oh, I got one too. What...?

39:31.650 --> 39:36.056
My. "Zoology." That's what
you were talking about earlier.

39:36.189 --> 39:37.357
- Yes. Exactly.
- Yes.

39:37.490 --> 39:39.092
Your avatar is a zoologist.

39:39.225 --> 39:43.029
You know, my nephew Maxwell
is a veterinarian.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.298
- What a fascinating...
- "Linguistics"?

39:45.432 --> 39:48.101
- I didn't have that last time.
- The study of languages.

39:48.234 --> 39:50.703
Makes sense.
He studies the entire language

39:50.837 --> 39:52.305
on his way to the point.

39:52.439 --> 39:55.574
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

39:55.708 --> 39:56.876
Time does fly.

39:57.010 --> 39:58.577
Okay, let's get it over with.

40:03.049 --> 40:04.583
You gotta be kidding me.

40:04.717 --> 40:07.053
Well, geometry is...

40:07.187 --> 40:08.587
- Is new.
- Yeah.

40:08.721 --> 40:10.790
Who wouldn't wanna
be better at geometry?

40:10.924 --> 40:13.193
And for weaknesses,
"Endurance."

40:13.326 --> 40:17.130
And what else? Let's see,
"Heat, sun and sand."

40:19.999 --> 40:21.801
Shouldn't be a problem.
It's not like

40:21.935 --> 40:25.071
we're in the middle of
a goddamn desert or anything.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.774
What's the point of this guy?
Who even needs this guy?

40:27.907 --> 40:29.109
He can read the map.

40:29.242 --> 40:31.144
Easy for you to say,
you got nunchucks!

40:31.277 --> 40:34.481
I've been training four hours
a day for six months.

40:34.613 --> 40:36.382
Now look at me!

40:36.516 --> 40:38.985
Man, it is hot out here!

40:39.119 --> 40:43.857
How is this guy a character
in an adventure game?

40:43.990 --> 40:45.592
Okay, okay, okay.

40:45.725 --> 40:48.627
I gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

40:48.761 --> 40:49.863
I know how to do that.

40:49.996 --> 40:51.598
Burpees.
Five burpees, right now.

40:51.764 --> 40:52.999
Get it going!

40:56.002 --> 40:57.837
- That's one.
- One!

41:03.676 --> 41:05.945
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah, come on!

41:08.248 --> 41:10.617
North is that way!

41:23.630 --> 41:24.964
You know, it's, uh...

41:25.098 --> 41:27.100
It's really good
to see you, Ed.

41:27.233 --> 41:28.635
I don't wanna hear it.

41:28.768 --> 41:30.970
You don't wanna hear
that it's good to see you?

41:31.104 --> 41:34.673
- You sold me out, Milo.
- I did not sell you out.

41:34.807 --> 41:36.876
We sold our business.
It was time.

41:37.010 --> 41:39.879
- Yeah, time for who?
- Well, it was time for me.

41:40.013 --> 41:41.814
Okay? Standing on my feet,

41:41.948 --> 41:44.317
serving a hundred plates
a night for 35 years?

41:44.450 --> 41:46.252
I was done.

41:46.386 --> 41:48.221
I was ready, man.

41:48.354 --> 41:50.056
I was ready to retire.

41:50.190 --> 41:51.424
I'm done talking!

42:06.539 --> 42:08.007
"The Oasis."

42:10.577 --> 42:12.412
I guess
that's the next level.

42:14.647 --> 42:15.848
Huh?

42:17.050 --> 42:19.152
The next level
of the game.

42:19.285 --> 42:20.520
We're in
a game?

42:20.653 --> 42:22.755
Oh. Yes, Grandpa Eddie,
we are in a game.

42:22.889 --> 42:24.157
You can't be
serious.

42:24.290 --> 42:25.658
Did you know
about this?

42:25.792 --> 42:27.727
I thought
you were done talking.

42:39.872 --> 42:41.774
- Bethany?
- Yep.

42:43.076 --> 42:45.411
- My name's Bethany too.
- Really?

42:45.545 --> 42:47.647
Daddy, her name's Bethany too.

42:52.619 --> 42:54.587
Sure is, sweetie.

42:54.722 --> 42:56.823
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

43:00.126 --> 43:01.729
Sure, yeah. Uh, come in.

43:02.962 --> 43:03.997
I'm sorry, I just...

43:04.130 --> 43:05.565
I didn't know
where else to go.

43:05.699 --> 43:07.400
No, no, no, it's okay.

43:07.533 --> 43:09.102
I'm glad you came.

43:09.235 --> 43:12.438
Do you think you can help me
get the machine to start?

43:15.975 --> 43:17.410
That is so dangerous.

43:17.543 --> 43:18.645
I know.

43:20.613 --> 43:22.148
But I have to try.

43:24.450 --> 43:25.753
They're my team.

43:39.132 --> 43:41.401
So, what exactly
are we looking for again?

43:41.534 --> 43:43.403
We're looking
for my grandson, genius.

43:43.536 --> 43:46.806
Okay, "Follow the flame
to the desert fruit."

43:49.743 --> 43:50.843
Look.

43:52.645 --> 43:53.813
They're here.

43:53.946 --> 43:55.515
Hyenas.

43:55.648 --> 43:58.318
Unusual for
their bone-crushing teeth.

44:02.255 --> 44:04.123
Smoke Stack.

44:04.257 --> 44:05.892
Where's there's smoke...

44:06.025 --> 44:08.127
There's fire.

44:08.261 --> 44:09.996
- Come on.
- Mm.

44:10.129 --> 44:12.665
- Boom!
- You call that a roll?

44:12.800 --> 44:14.067
Not bad at all.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.535
I'll bet you two more!

44:15.668 --> 44:18.304
Drinks! Drinks over here!

44:18.438 --> 44:19.472
Another round here!

44:19.605 --> 44:21.174
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

44:41.527 --> 44:43.229
I thought
you'd never come back.

44:46.032 --> 44:47.667
I need to talk to you.

44:50.069 --> 44:51.404
Absolutely.

44:52.538 --> 44:55.041
Not here, not now.

44:55.174 --> 44:56.777
Not around them.

45:02.882 --> 45:04.217
Leave me alone!

45:09.055 --> 45:10.089
Wow.

45:11.725 --> 45:12.925
Fiery.

45:13.059 --> 45:15.027
Not a real person.

45:15.161 --> 45:17.230
- What'd she say?
- Well, she said she thought

45:17.363 --> 45:20.233
I was never gonna come back,
she wants to get together later,

45:20.366 --> 45:22.935
- and we all know what that means.
- Hiyo!

45:23.069 --> 45:25.037
It means that she's got
a clue for you.

45:25.171 --> 45:27.507
Oh, that's a coincidence.
I got a clue for her.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.242
- You got a clue for her.
- Wait.

45:29.375 --> 45:32.278
She's your ex-girlfriend.
She's the flame.

45:32.412 --> 45:34.180
- "Follow the flame."
- What?

45:45.591 --> 45:47.460
The jewel, it's here.

46:03.576 --> 46:05.511
Is that the guy
that killed my parents?

46:05.645 --> 46:08.080
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

46:10.650 --> 46:12.920
We lost a good man today.

46:14.420 --> 46:15.756
The very best of us.

46:17.657 --> 46:19.625
For Dagfinn...

46:19.760 --> 46:21.961
wasn't just my hyena master.

46:23.296 --> 46:24.898
He was my friend.

46:25.031 --> 46:27.400
I loved him like a brother.

46:28.601 --> 46:31.637
And now he's gone.

46:31.772 --> 46:34.440
And his beloved hyenas
are left...

46:34.574 --> 46:36.108
without their master.

46:40.379 --> 46:41.748
Long live Dagfinn.

46:41.882 --> 46:44.751
Long live Dagfinn!

46:44.885 --> 46:47.153
Why did he have to die?

46:49.655 --> 46:51.859
He died because...

46:51.991 --> 46:54.093
he made a mistake.

46:54.227 --> 46:57.630
He tried to steal something
quite precious from me.

46:59.198 --> 47:01.467
He left me no choice.

47:01.601 --> 47:03.503
And now...

47:03.636 --> 47:07.673
I feed him
to his beloved hyenas.

47:11.644 --> 47:13.379
- That's messed up.
- Oh!

47:13.513 --> 47:15.581
I loved Dagfinn!

47:17.383 --> 47:19.720
There's none among you
I love as much.

47:20.988 --> 47:22.421
And so...

47:27.493 --> 47:29.061
The key!

47:30.129 --> 47:31.899
It's gone.

47:32.966 --> 47:35.134
Thief!

47:35.268 --> 47:37.804
I got her. I got the thief.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.572
Wait.

47:39.706 --> 47:42.041
- Are you guys...? Wha...?
- Come here.

47:42.174 --> 47:44.678
- Catch her!
- Don't let her get away.

47:48.015 --> 47:50.483
Trying to steal
the key to my chest?

47:51.785 --> 47:53.553
Nope.

47:53.687 --> 47:54.721
Shake her down.

47:57.724 --> 47:59.425
I'm sorry, I did it.
It was my fault.

47:59.559 --> 48:01.093
I, uh...

48:02.528 --> 48:05.097
I just... I don't...

48:05.231 --> 48:08.267
I don't know what I was...
Oy vey.

48:08.401 --> 48:12.806
Uh, it's like, um...
It's like I'm hyperventilating.

48:12.940 --> 48:15.141
Does anyone have,
like, a eucalyptus inhaler?

48:15.274 --> 48:16.977
Or a brown paper bag?

48:17.109 --> 48:18.045
Spencer?

48:18.177 --> 48:19.545
Is it really hot in here?

48:19.680 --> 48:21.113
You mean...?

48:21.247 --> 48:23.616
- That's him. Right there.
- What?

48:23.750 --> 48:26.787
That ain't Spencer.
Look, I know my grandson.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.021
My grandson's a guy.

48:29.555 --> 48:31.058
Did he change his hair?

48:32.224 --> 48:34.193
- Cut off her head.
- Yeah!

48:34.327 --> 48:36.262
- Cut off her head!
- Wait, wait, wait.

48:36.395 --> 48:39.632
I just think, uh, maybe
don't cut off my head?

48:39.766 --> 48:40.633
- Oh!
- Spencer!

48:40.767 --> 48:42.069
- Oh, my.
- Did he just...?

48:42.201 --> 48:43.135
Oh, Lord.

48:45.204 --> 48:46.439
That's my Life Alert.

48:46.572 --> 48:48.041
I gotta take my pill.

48:54.848 --> 48:56.148
Come on!

48:58.018 --> 48:58.986
Spencer!

48:59.118 --> 49:00.854
Oh, my God, you're alive.

49:00.988 --> 49:02.856
What are you guys doing here?

49:02.990 --> 49:05.692
What are we doing here?
We came to get you, fool!

49:05.826 --> 49:08.829
- Bethany?
- Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

49:08.962 --> 49:10.529
What? So, um...

49:10.663 --> 49:13.000
Milo Walker, darling.

49:15.068 --> 49:16.502
Milo?

49:18.739 --> 49:21.307
- Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
- Grandpa?

49:21.440 --> 49:23.710
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer right here.

49:23.844 --> 49:26.178
What are you stealing for?

49:26.312 --> 49:28.949
- I'm still me.
- Oh.

49:29.082 --> 49:30.017
Hey.

49:30.149 --> 49:32.853
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:37.390 --> 49:38.357
Come on.

49:42.662 --> 49:44.330
Let's go.

49:54.074 --> 49:56.843
Damn it, I was so close.
I had the key in my hand.

49:56.977 --> 49:59.178
- Why'd you stop me?
- Huh? Someone yelled "thief,"

49:59.311 --> 50:00.947
so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

50:01.081 --> 50:03.416
You shouldn't have come.
I had it under control.

50:03.549 --> 50:05.986
Did you? It looked like
you just got murdered.

50:06.119 --> 50:08.755
I mean, what the hell, Spencer?
Why are you even here?

50:08.889 --> 50:10.356
Why did you have the game?

50:10.489 --> 50:13.827
We destroyed it
so that this would never happen!

50:13.960 --> 50:15.696
I went back and got it, okay?

50:15.829 --> 50:19.032
I don't know
why I did it, but I did.

50:19.166 --> 50:21.835
And then last night...

50:21.968 --> 50:23.536
I've been in kind
of a weird place,

50:23.669 --> 50:25.504
and something
came over me, okay?

50:25.638 --> 50:27.841
And now we're all
stuck here again!

50:27.974 --> 50:32.645
I thought that I would be him.
Bravestone!

50:32.779 --> 50:34.881
I wanted to feel
like that again.

50:36.950 --> 50:39.853
Like... I could do anything.

50:42.321 --> 50:44.758
But instead, I'm, um...

50:44.891 --> 50:46.727
Ming Fleetfoot.

50:48.695 --> 50:51.263
"Cat burglar,
pickpocket, safecracker."

50:51.397 --> 50:53.066
Another better character.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.434
- "Weakness: pollen."
- Yeah.

50:55.568 --> 50:57.771
She's small and crafty
and has allergies.

50:57.904 --> 50:59.005
She's basically me.

51:00.207 --> 51:02.175
I swear, man, if we survive,

51:02.308 --> 51:04.477
I am gonna kill you.

51:04.610 --> 51:07.313
I just can't believe
you came back here on purpose.

51:07.446 --> 51:09.381
I'm sorry. Okay?

51:11.617 --> 51:13.153
I'm sorry.

51:14.453 --> 51:15.654
Wait!

51:15.789 --> 51:17.224
Oh, there she is.

51:17.356 --> 51:19.726
- Who?
- My ex.

51:19.860 --> 51:21.327
Okay.

51:21.460 --> 51:22.729
Hi.

51:24.131 --> 51:26.967
If my husband knew
I was talking to you,

51:27.100 --> 51:29.236
you'd be dead by morning.

51:29.368 --> 51:31.938
Uh, don't tell him?

51:32.072 --> 51:34.406
Listen to me,
Jurgen and his army

51:34.540 --> 51:36.408
are returning to his fortress.

51:36.542 --> 51:39.746
There, they will meet
the Brothers Kababik.

51:39.880 --> 51:43.315
He will trade the Falcon Jewel,
and an alliance will be formed.

51:43.449 --> 51:46.953
You must get the jewel
before that happens.

51:47.087 --> 51:48.554
You're our only hope,

51:48.688 --> 51:50.724
so you must hurry.

51:52.793 --> 51:53.960
Oh, my.

51:56.797 --> 51:58.397
- Now you must go.
- Gotta go.

51:58.531 --> 51:59.933
They're gonna meet
the Brothers who?

52:00.066 --> 52:01.433
The Brothers Kababik.

52:01.567 --> 52:03.502
- The Brothers Bababik.
- Shh!

52:03.636 --> 52:05.939
- Kababik?
- You must get the jewel

52:06.072 --> 52:07.339
before that happens.

52:07.473 --> 52:10.877
You are our only hope,
so you must hurry.

52:18.752 --> 52:21.221
I think you should explain it
to us one more time.

52:21.353 --> 52:22.889
- Wait a second.
- Oh!

52:23.023 --> 52:24.356
What about the desert fruit?

52:24.490 --> 52:25.692
Aren't you gonna
lead us to that?

52:25.826 --> 52:27.694
Now I must go...

52:27.828 --> 52:29.996
before Switchblade
realizes I'm gone.

52:31.698 --> 52:33.767
What? Switchblade?

52:33.900 --> 52:34.868
That's his weakness.

52:36.368 --> 52:38.839
I love you, Dr. Bravestone.

52:40.106 --> 52:42.209
And I always will.

52:42.341 --> 52:44.144
That...

52:44.277 --> 52:46.345
is my curse.

52:49.916 --> 52:51.284
I love you too!

52:53.019 --> 52:55.155
Well, she seems
like a nice girl.

52:59.826 --> 53:01.862
We need camels.

53:01.995 --> 53:05.397
Okay, if we're gonna catch up
with Jurgen, we need camels.

53:05.531 --> 53:08.735
And we need to find the desert
fruit, whatever that is.

53:08.869 --> 53:11.338
"Follow the flame."
I guess we have to follow her.

53:11.470 --> 53:14.007
You guys follow her,
we'll go steal some camels.

53:33.827 --> 53:35.061
Whoa.

54:01.688 --> 54:03.455
"Jumanji Berry Tree."

54:03.589 --> 54:05.457
Jumanji berry?

54:05.591 --> 54:08.028
That's a desert fruit?

54:08.161 --> 54:10.230
I guess.

54:10.363 --> 54:14.334
"In the moment of need,
remember the seed."

54:14.466 --> 54:16.403
A little bit
of Jumanji wisdom there.

54:22.042 --> 54:23.176
There it is.

54:28.048 --> 54:30.250
Milo and I will break in
and get the camels.

54:30.383 --> 54:33.086
Grandpa, you stay here on
lookout. Keep a low profile.

54:33.219 --> 54:35.487
Got it? Low profile.

54:35.621 --> 54:37.456
If anyone tries
to enter the livery,

54:37.589 --> 54:40.126
just, I don't know,
whistle or something.

54:40.260 --> 54:41.627
Sure thing.

54:45.932 --> 54:47.367
That's not when you smolder.

54:47.499 --> 54:49.936
It's not the moment for it.
Forget it.

54:50.070 --> 54:51.637
I did it.
I don't know what it was.

54:51.771 --> 54:53.907
Look like your stomach
is upset.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.674
Like you ate something bad.

54:58.278 --> 54:59.645
Oh, man.

54:59.779 --> 55:02.282
I'm sweating. I'm sweating.

55:02.415 --> 55:04.117
Stealing makes me
very uncomfortable,

55:04.250 --> 55:07.454
which is not ideal
for a burglar.

55:29.508 --> 55:31.878
So the fruit
is in the tree.

55:32.012 --> 55:33.213
But you can't get to it

55:33.346 --> 55:34.814
without going through
the water

55:34.948 --> 55:36.416
or whatever that is.

55:36.548 --> 55:39.386
Get boiled or eaten by piranhas
or something.

55:43.223 --> 55:44.656
"Follow the flame."

55:46.159 --> 55:48.395
I think that's how we get there.

55:48.527 --> 55:51.663
But I don't know how
I'm supposed to make that jump.

55:51.798 --> 55:54.234
I mean, it's doable...

55:54.367 --> 55:56.736
but I don't have
my usual explosiveness.

55:57.804 --> 56:00.639
- Ugh!
- Wh... Ho! Yo!

56:00.774 --> 56:02.976
Ho, ho, ho! Wow!

56:11.951 --> 56:12.852
Yes!

56:16.322 --> 56:18.590
Martha! Ho!

56:21.660 --> 56:23.530
Martha!

56:23.662 --> 56:24.864
Oh...

56:28.667 --> 56:31.204
- Martha!
- Oh, it's really heavy.

56:32.539 --> 56:35.275
Ugh! You okay?
Give me your hand.

56:35.408 --> 56:36.575
There you go.

56:44.684 --> 56:46.618
Ow. Oh...

56:49.689 --> 56:51.291
Wait a second.

56:51.424 --> 56:53.460
- What...?
- The hell, man?

56:53.592 --> 56:55.428
Oh, my God!

56:55.562 --> 56:57.564
- The hell, man?
- Oh, my God.

57:00.266 --> 57:02.302
- Fridge?
- Yeah.

57:02.435 --> 57:04.204
Martha?

57:04.337 --> 57:05.637
Yeah.

57:11.744 --> 57:14.781
Hey, move along.
Nothing to see here.

57:14.914 --> 57:15.982
What'd you say?

57:16.116 --> 57:17.616
I said, keep walking, pal.

57:17.750 --> 57:20.320
Nothing to see here. Beat it.

57:20.453 --> 57:24.591
- What'd you say?
- Beat it, get out of here.

57:24.724 --> 57:25.992
What'd you say?

57:36.970 --> 57:38.104
I said, scram!

57:46.079 --> 57:50.150
You want a piece of me?
Yeah, come on, come on.

57:50.283 --> 57:52.585
What do you got?
What do you got? Come on!

57:53.820 --> 57:55.955
Come and get it. Yeah!

57:59.459 --> 58:01.427
Come on, you bastards!

58:02.495 --> 58:05.265
Ha, wow! Ha, ha!

58:05.398 --> 58:07.200
Here, camel, camel.

58:08.334 --> 58:09.702
Come on, let's go.

58:11.437 --> 58:14.474
They are proud and majestic
animals, aren't they?

58:18.578 --> 58:20.880
Oh, you're welcome. Heh.

58:22.982 --> 58:26.986
Did you...? Were you
just talking to them?

58:27.120 --> 58:29.756
Um, press your menu.
Uh, it's right here.

58:32.458 --> 58:33.826
"Linguistics."

58:33.960 --> 58:35.595
You can talk to animals.

58:35.728 --> 58:36.729
Yes.

58:36.863 --> 58:39.265
It appears that I speak camel.

58:39.399 --> 58:41.034
Can you ask them to
come with us and...?

58:42.468 --> 58:43.770
Excuse me.

58:45.505 --> 58:47.006
They're willing to talk.

58:47.140 --> 58:49.042
Uh, they wanna know
what's in it for them

58:49.175 --> 58:51.511
and how much luggage we have.

58:51.644 --> 58:55.048
Will you look at me? Oh!

58:55.181 --> 58:57.685
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with this?

58:57.817 --> 58:59.252
You read the map.

58:59.385 --> 59:01.754
I don't wanna read the map.
I'm supposed to be her.

59:01.888 --> 59:04.824
Instead, there's actual hair
growing out of my face!

59:04.958 --> 59:09.262
Sorry. All bodies are beautiful,
even this one.

59:09.395 --> 59:10.997
Wait a second.

59:16.302 --> 59:20.273
- Oh, this is amazing!
- Careful.

59:20.406 --> 59:21.574
Fridge...

59:24.377 --> 59:27.313
Yo, this thing is insane!

59:27.447 --> 59:29.148
Be careful.
That body is not a toy.

59:29.282 --> 59:30.883
No, it's a machine.

59:31.017 --> 59:33.419
And on top of that...

59:33.553 --> 59:35.088
boobs.

59:35.221 --> 59:37.090
Touch my boobs,
and I will murder you.

59:37.223 --> 59:39.559
Too late. It was literally
the first thing I did.

59:39.693 --> 59:40.960
Ew!

59:42.795 --> 59:45.398
Hey, hey, don't do that.

59:45.531 --> 59:47.300
Let's take this berry
and go meet them.

59:47.433 --> 59:48.968
Relax, girl.

59:49.102 --> 59:51.237
I'm trying that flying
acrobat thing you did.

59:51.371 --> 59:52.939
- Don't. We have the berry.
- Check this out.

59:53.072 --> 59:54.607
- It's not necessary.
- Omaha, Omaha!

59:54.742 --> 59:56.309
- Hut, hut, hike!
- Wait.

59:58.945 --> 01:00:01.814
Fridge, be careful! I am telling
you, that body's a weapon.

01:00:01.948 --> 01:00:03.316
You don't know
what it's capable of.

01:00:03.449 --> 01:00:04.484
This is amazing!

01:00:04.617 --> 01:00:06.319
That body's a loaded gun!

01:00:06.452 --> 01:00:09.455
Yeah! And this gun's
about to go off!

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:11.324
Whoo... Oh!

01:00:11.457 --> 01:00:13.226
Oh, my God!

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.994
Fridge!

01:00:15.128 --> 01:00:16.496
- Come here.
- Ugh!

01:00:16.629 --> 01:00:19.332
Oh, my God.
Goddamn it!

01:00:19.465 --> 01:00:21.735
- Here, I got you. I got ya.
- Ugh!

01:00:33.346 --> 01:00:36.182
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:00:36.316 --> 01:00:38.384
Oh, my God, that was awful.

01:00:38.518 --> 01:00:40.453
I hate being the map guy!

01:00:43.656 --> 01:00:45.124
Let's get out of here.

01:00:50.997 --> 01:00:53.132
Switchblade! There he is.

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:55.868
Bravestone!

01:00:56.002 --> 01:00:58.371
I told you to stay
the hell away from my wife!

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:05.679
- We got company.
- What did you do?

01:01:05.813 --> 01:01:08.348
All right, guys, this is
the moment. We need you now.

01:01:11.851 --> 01:01:16.022
Uh, they said that we can
get away out the back door.

01:01:16.155 --> 01:01:18.958
- Are you talking to that camel?
- Yes.

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:20.828
That's Lucille and Hank.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.628
And Jeffrey's in the back.

01:01:30.336 --> 01:01:31.938
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:01:34.507 --> 01:01:36.275
- We should get going.
- What happened?

01:01:36.409 --> 01:01:38.077
My grandpa beat up
45 strangers.

01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:40.213
That woman's husband
is trying to kill him.

01:01:40.346 --> 01:01:41.682
Mm.

01:01:41.815 --> 01:01:43.216
Is that the desert fruit?

01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:44.852
Yeah. It's a Jumanji berry,

01:01:44.984 --> 01:01:47.186
and it weighs like 100 pounds.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.421
My grandpa will carry it.

01:01:51.759 --> 01:01:52.959
We should get out of here.

01:01:53.092 --> 01:01:54.927
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.

01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:56.764
- I could take them.
- What?

01:01:56.896 --> 01:01:58.097
What? We escaped.

01:01:58.231 --> 01:02:00.533
- I said, I could take them.
- Oh, Eddie.

01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:02.668
No, Grandpa Eddie,
that's Switchblade!

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.872
I'm telling you,
there's a time when you run.

01:02:05.004 --> 01:02:07.273
Then there's a time in life,
like now, where you stay...

01:02:13.079 --> 01:02:15.716
Yeah! Yeah!

01:02:15.849 --> 01:02:17.116
<i>Switchblade! Switchblade!</i>

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.918
Nice shot, Switchblade!

01:02:27.193 --> 01:02:28.261
- Oh!
- Phew.

01:02:36.035 --> 01:02:36.969
What?

01:02:50.149 --> 01:02:52.686
We should see
Mount Zhatmire pretty soon.

01:02:55.121 --> 01:02:58.958
You know, Gladys and I took
a road trip before she passed.

01:02:59.091 --> 01:03:01.427
We went on a ceramics tour

01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:03.062
through the Southwest.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.665
I lost my restaurant
so you could drive around

01:03:05.799 --> 01:03:07.901
- and look at ashtrays?
- Yes, Ed.

01:03:08.067 --> 01:03:10.436
That's what you do
when you retire.

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:12.806
You explore your interests.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.574
I don't have interests.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.343
Guys like me, we don't retire!

01:03:17.477 --> 01:03:19.479
We work,
and then we keep working,

01:03:19.612 --> 01:03:21.314
and then, eventually, we die.

01:03:21.447 --> 01:03:24.317
But you retired me.
You retired me.

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:26.854
It's a wonder I lasted
as long as I did.

01:03:26.986 --> 01:03:29.088
- What?
- You're a difficult man, Ed.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.324
You don't abandon
your best friend, Milo.

01:03:31.457 --> 01:03:34.895
When I lost the restaurant,
I lost everything!

01:03:35.027 --> 01:03:36.062
You...?

01:03:37.263 --> 01:03:39.131
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

01:03:39.265 --> 01:03:42.368
- Are you talking to my camel?
- Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

01:03:42.502 --> 01:03:45.973
And he can tell
that you're a pain in the ass.

01:03:46.105 --> 01:03:48.407
My camel's taking your side?

01:03:49.943 --> 01:03:51.979
And he's not your camel.

01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:54.046
He's just giving you a ride.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.150
Oh! Well, how about the both
of you go screw yourselves?

01:03:58.284 --> 01:04:00.353
- What did you just say?
- Guys!

01:04:00.486 --> 01:04:03.790
You and me, we gonna settle
this right here, right now!

01:04:05.358 --> 01:04:07.026
- I'll show you.
- What are you doing?

01:04:07.159 --> 01:04:10.062
- Don't worry about it.
- Milo, what are you doing?

01:04:10.196 --> 01:04:12.799
Hold on. Wait, wait.
Here we go.

01:04:17.004 --> 01:04:20.473
You want a piece of me, huh?
That's what you want?

01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:23.142
You do not want a piece of him,
Milo, I'm telling you.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.645
Oh, that's where
you're wrong, young man.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.814
'Cause I do want a piece.

01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:30.017
I want a big piece.

01:04:30.149 --> 01:04:35.187
See, Eddie, what you don't know
is that for the last 15 years,

01:04:35.321 --> 01:04:37.623
I've been studying tai chi.

01:04:37.758 --> 01:04:39.125
And right now,

01:04:39.258 --> 01:04:41.527
I am harnessing my chi.

01:04:41.661 --> 01:04:44.731
And when I'm done,
I'm gonna whup your ass.

01:04:44.865 --> 01:04:47.868
Milo, I am telling you,
this is not a good idea.

01:04:52.171 --> 01:04:53.606
No!

01:04:59.579 --> 01:05:02.114
Oh, dude!

01:05:02.248 --> 01:05:04.417
You gotta stop
killing everybody.

01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:14.061
All right, then.

01:05:14.193 --> 01:05:16.930
Well, I guess that's settled.

01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:31.377
The camels just stopped.

01:05:35.214 --> 01:05:37.249
This is as far as they go.

01:05:37.383 --> 01:05:39.686
To get to Jurgen's fortress,
they said that we can

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.288
head down this path here
and make a right.

01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:43.924
Then we're in his territory.

01:05:44.057 --> 01:05:45.424
And they don't wanna
go there

01:05:45.558 --> 01:05:48.494
because they
don't want to die.

01:05:48.628 --> 01:05:50.697
We don't wanna die either.

01:05:55.568 --> 01:05:58.038
He's the worst Bravestone
of all time.

01:06:32.806 --> 01:06:35.474
So we have to get
across... this.

01:06:39.046 --> 01:06:41.748
Okay, we can do this.
We can do this.

01:06:41.882 --> 01:06:44.216
We have to take our time,
make careful decisions.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.218
What are you talking about?
It's obvious.

01:06:46.352 --> 01:06:47.721
We start on that bridge there,

01:06:47.854 --> 01:06:50.057
then jump to that one
that heads to the right,

01:06:50.189 --> 01:06:52.693
and then those look
like two sides of a trapezoid...

01:06:54.061 --> 01:06:57.496
Geometry.
That's what it's for!

01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:59.833
Maybe this character's
not totally worthless.

01:07:01.168 --> 01:07:02.936
- I'll go first.
- Really?

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:09.810
You see? It's no big deal.

01:07:11.845 --> 01:07:13.013
Oh.
What's going on?

01:07:13.146 --> 01:07:15.048
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, no.

01:07:17.684 --> 01:07:18.885
- No.
- Grandpa!

01:07:22.555 --> 01:07:23.990
Ah, crap.

01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:26.525
Ah, geez.

01:07:28.161 --> 01:07:29.662
What the hell?

01:07:33.066 --> 01:07:35.102
- It's okay. We can do this.
- Yeah?

01:07:35.267 --> 01:07:36.937
It's about finding
the right timing.

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:38.839
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Follow me.

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:45.746
Come on!

01:07:45.879 --> 01:07:47.580
Come on, Milo, come on!

01:07:49.716 --> 01:07:52.819
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

01:07:52.953 --> 01:07:54.988
- Oh! Oh, Lord.
- Here.

01:07:55.122 --> 01:07:56.622
Oh, okay.

01:08:02.394 --> 01:08:03.629
Hey, you guys.

01:08:03.764 --> 01:08:05.799
Is that rock... moving?

01:08:11.204 --> 01:08:13.372
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.709
Well, now, this is a problem.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.978
- Come on, what is it?
- Oh, my.

01:08:18.111 --> 01:08:20.147
- Spit it out!
- What is it?

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:23.282
- Tell us!
- Tell us! Milo!

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.388
Those are mandrills.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.657
- We should go. Go, go!
- Go!

01:08:35.761 --> 01:08:37.798
That one! Obtuse angle!

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:41.968
Note the distinctive
and colorful pigment

01:08:42.102 --> 01:08:44.104
around their face and buttocks.

01:08:47.841 --> 01:08:50.509
Mandrills are the heaviest
of all monkeys.

01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:55.015
Even heavier than baboons, with
which they are often confused.

01:08:57.684 --> 01:08:59.484
And now head for the rhombus!

01:08:59.618 --> 01:09:01.554
Come on. Hurry up.

01:09:01.688 --> 01:09:02.956
- Rhombus! Rhombus!
- Come on.

01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:13.800
No, Martha!

01:09:13.934 --> 01:09:15.935
- You're on the wrong bridge!
- What?

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.502
The perpendicular one!

01:09:24.778 --> 01:09:25.946
Martha!

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.286
Martha!

01:09:36.488 --> 01:09:38.225
No!

01:09:38.357 --> 01:09:41.328
No!

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.830
Spencer, behind you!

01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:47.834
Jump!

01:09:47.968 --> 01:09:50.270
Come on, I got you!

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:53.907
Spencer!

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:02.916
Oh, no! Ow! Ow!

01:10:13.159 --> 01:10:15.461
Oh, no! No! Ow! Ow!

01:10:15.594 --> 01:10:16.629
Get off!

01:10:23.402 --> 01:10:25.171
Come on.

01:10:30.176 --> 01:10:31.912
All right, bring it on.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.017
Come on, come here. Ha, ha!

01:10:39.052 --> 01:10:40.519
- Grandpa!
- Ow!

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.689
Grandpa! Enough!

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:44.224
- Grandpa, stop!
- Yeah!

01:10:44.357 --> 01:10:45.225
They're gone!

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.229
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

01:10:56.803 --> 01:10:58.171
Come on!

01:11:04.077 --> 01:11:05.245
Give me your hand!

01:11:05.378 --> 01:11:06.780
- What?
- Trust me!

01:11:27.934 --> 01:11:29.336
Oh! Go.

01:11:30.971 --> 01:11:33.807
Last one. Aim for
the center of the parabola!

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:40.080
Oh, damn. Ugh! Son of a...

01:11:41.815 --> 01:11:43.450
Ow!

01:11:45.785 --> 01:11:48.421
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.690
- Eddie?
- Milo!

01:11:50.824 --> 01:11:53.393
Eddie!
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

01:11:54.526 --> 01:11:56.029
I need your help, Eddie.

01:11:58.465 --> 01:11:59.631
Eddie!

01:12:01.835 --> 01:12:02.802
Oh!

01:12:05.438 --> 01:12:09.843
- Oh!
- Ugh.

01:12:12.379 --> 01:12:14.414
Eddie! Milo!

01:12:21.788 --> 01:12:23.156
Oh!

01:12:35.835 --> 01:12:37.871
- Seriously?
- Later.

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:40.639
- Run!
- Run!

01:12:58.657 --> 01:12:59.893
Hyah!

01:13:14.741 --> 01:13:16.409
Hey, guys.

01:13:16.543 --> 01:13:17.777
Who the hell's this?

01:13:17.911 --> 01:13:20.213
Alex, what are you doing here?

01:13:20.346 --> 01:13:22.415
Bethany thought
you might need some help.

01:13:22.549 --> 01:13:25.018
- Where is Bethany?
- She's right here.

01:13:26.052 --> 01:13:27.187
You mean...?

01:13:33.426 --> 01:13:35.627
"Oh, my God, right?

01:13:35.762 --> 01:13:38.098
Like, I'm a total horse.

01:13:38.231 --> 01:13:41.067
I can't believe
that we found you guys.

01:13:41.201 --> 01:13:42.902
Hi."

01:13:43.036 --> 01:13:45.872
Yep, that's Bethany.
Ha-ha-ha. What's up, girl?

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:47.073
Hey.

01:13:47.207 --> 01:13:49.042
Oh, we brought you
some clothes.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.443
You must be freezing.

01:13:55.815 --> 01:13:59.319
So, uh, this horse
is a character in the game?

01:13:59.452 --> 01:14:01.354
Yeah. Cyclone's his name.

01:14:03.923 --> 01:14:05.458
- How's that feel?
- I don't know.

01:14:05.592 --> 01:14:07.460
I sprained it pretty good.

01:14:07.594 --> 01:14:08.995
Where'd you get these clothes?

01:14:09.129 --> 01:14:11.197
When I realized how far
north we were going,

01:14:11.331 --> 01:14:12.966
- we stopped to go shopping.
- Ah.

01:14:13.099 --> 01:14:15.135
You can shop here?
How did you know that?

01:14:15.268 --> 01:14:17.470
I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

01:14:17.604 --> 01:14:19.539
At least I got rid
of that stupid hat.

01:14:19.671 --> 01:14:21.441
Now I got this stupid hat.

01:14:37.724 --> 01:14:39.325
It's something,
isn't it?

01:14:40.793 --> 01:14:42.428
Yeah,
it's something.

01:14:45.265 --> 01:14:47.500
You know, Eddie...

01:14:47.634 --> 01:14:52.338
you didn't lose everything
when you lost the restaurant.

01:14:52.472 --> 01:14:54.274
You still got a lot, man.

01:14:58.978 --> 01:15:00.246
I lost my friend.

01:15:03.349 --> 01:15:04.584
So did I.

01:15:18.665 --> 01:15:20.033
I'm sorry, Milo.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.076
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:32.680
I should have tracked you down
a long time ago.

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:37.483
I'm glad you came over
for coffee.

01:15:40.853 --> 01:15:42.722
What made you do it, huh?

01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:46.059
I mean, why now?

01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:50.530
Milo, what's going on?

01:15:56.569 --> 01:15:57.705
You're sick.

01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:03.042
How bad?

01:16:04.944 --> 01:16:06.879
I don't have much time left.

01:16:10.049 --> 01:16:12.252
Son of a bitch.

01:16:12.385 --> 01:16:14.954
But I count myself lucky,
Eddie.

01:16:15.088 --> 01:16:18.057
I was married
to a wonderful woman.

01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:20.893
I got to live a wonderful life.

01:16:21.027 --> 01:16:23.563
And not everybody
can say that.

01:16:23.697 --> 01:16:26.933
That's why I wanted
to make things better with you.

01:16:27.066 --> 01:16:29.402
And now that they are...

01:16:29.535 --> 01:16:31.571
well, I'm...

01:16:31.705 --> 01:16:33.373
I'm happy about that too.

01:16:47.387 --> 01:16:50.923
Grandpa, Milo.
Come on, we gotta go.

01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:59.399
"The Fortress."

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:01.634
Looks like
the last level.

01:17:01.769 --> 01:17:04.103
Okay, so we, uh,
climb that mountain

01:17:04.237 --> 01:17:05.538
and then we sneak in somehow.

01:17:05.672 --> 01:17:07.173
Yeah,
and then we steal the jewel

01:17:07.307 --> 01:17:09.042
before the Brothers Kababik
get there.

01:17:09.175 --> 01:17:11.878
- And then show it to the sun?
- Sounds like a plan.

01:17:12.011 --> 01:17:13.613
What?

01:17:13.747 --> 01:17:17.050
I'm sorry, I think I missed
the "plan" part of the plan.

01:17:17.183 --> 01:17:20.386
That last level almost killed
us all. I can barely walk.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.790
Your grandpa beats the hell
out of the wrong guy

01:17:22.922 --> 01:17:25.793
or we get attacked by a bear,
what am I supposed to do?

01:17:25.925 --> 01:17:27.393
I'm not gonna beat up
the wrong guy.

01:17:27.527 --> 01:17:29.195
You are gonna beat up
the wrong guy!

01:17:29.329 --> 01:17:30.997
You're not a good Bravestone!

01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:32.700
You're too stubborn
and pissed off.

01:17:32.832 --> 01:17:34.200
You keep getting us killed.

01:17:34.334 --> 01:17:35.902
What the hell
you talking about?

01:17:36.035 --> 01:17:37.537
And Milo...

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:39.639
And I say this
with all due respect, sir.

01:17:39.773 --> 01:17:42.041
...is not a good person
to be the zoologist.

01:17:42.175 --> 01:17:44.243
He talks too slow,
and by the time

01:17:44.377 --> 01:17:46.012
he gets to the point,
you're dead!

01:17:46.145 --> 01:17:47.480
Once again, no offense.

01:17:47.613 --> 01:17:48.481
None taken.

01:17:48.614 --> 01:17:50.183
And let me tell you why.

01:17:50.316 --> 01:17:53.052
- Because my friend Bernard...
- You see?

01:17:53.186 --> 01:17:55.254
You're a thief who's
too neurotic to steal,

01:17:55.388 --> 01:17:57.056
Bethany's a horse...

01:17:58.792 --> 01:18:01.060
All I know is,
we are stuck here again,

01:18:01.194 --> 01:18:05.298
we are running out of lives,
and my ankle is killing me! Ahh!

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:07.300
- Oh, my God!
- Fridge!

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:09.669
Fridge! Are you okay?

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.339
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

01:18:26.552 --> 01:18:29.489
That's what the water
looked like at the tree.

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:30.890
When we...

01:18:31.023 --> 01:18:32.992
Switched bodies.

01:19:14.634 --> 01:19:16.837
- Goddamn, that is cold!
- Oh!

01:19:16.969 --> 01:19:20.908
Oh! Oh, man! It's freezing!

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.175
What the hell, man?

01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:25.478
Yes!

01:19:25.611 --> 01:19:26.847
I missed you so much.

01:19:26.979 --> 01:19:28.849
Oh, my God, you guys, hi.

01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:31.685
Ahem, Spencer?

01:19:32.985 --> 01:19:35.121
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:41.294
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, what?

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:44.597
Milo?

01:19:47.567 --> 01:19:49.035
You should see
the size of your...

01:19:49.168 --> 01:19:52.305
Phew. Damn.

01:19:52.438 --> 01:19:54.474
I never thought I'd be
this happy to shrink.

01:19:55.641 --> 01:19:56.844
I have never seen anything

01:19:56.976 --> 01:19:58.044
quite like that before.

01:19:58.177 --> 01:19:59.512
Oh, my God, it's so good

01:19:59.645 --> 01:20:01.849
to be able to talk again
with words.

01:20:01.981 --> 01:20:04.650
- Spencer, hi!
- Hey, Bethany.

01:20:04.785 --> 01:20:06.319
We have so much
catching up to do.

01:20:06.452 --> 01:20:07.821
I wanna hear about New York.

01:20:07.955 --> 01:20:10.924
But it feels like this
isn't the perfect moment.

01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:13.092
Right. Like, later.

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:14.360
Later.

01:20:15.995 --> 01:20:18.799
- Better?
- Yeah.

01:20:18.932 --> 01:20:20.466
Much.

01:20:24.604 --> 01:20:26.773
I got hair! Heh, heh!

01:20:26.907 --> 01:20:29.676
For the first time in 40 years.
I gotta go tell Milo.

01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:31.845
- Be careful out there, Grandpa.
- Yeah.

01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:33.346
- How's your ankle?
- Hm?

01:20:33.479 --> 01:20:35.381
- Your ankle.
- It's a little sore.

01:20:35.515 --> 01:20:37.450
Not as bad
as you were making it seem.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:39.318
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

01:20:39.452 --> 01:20:42.188
You were making a big deal
of it. It's not that bad.

01:20:48.127 --> 01:20:50.029
Hey! Get the hell away
from that horse!

01:20:50.162 --> 01:20:51.664
Freeze!

01:20:51.798 --> 01:20:53.332
Milo! Hey!

01:20:53.466 --> 01:20:54.968
Wait, which ankle was it?

01:20:55.101 --> 01:20:56.269
- Hold it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:56.402 --> 01:20:57.871
Get your hands off of me!

01:20:58.005 --> 01:21:00.172
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

01:21:00.306 --> 01:21:01.507
I'm right here.

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:06.914
Guys, guys.

01:21:07.981 --> 01:21:09.482
Eddie and Milo.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:10.550
They got them.

01:21:17.991 --> 01:21:19.559
There's ice everywhere,

01:21:19.693 --> 01:21:21.929
and there's only one road in.

01:21:22.061 --> 01:21:25.531
It's covered with guards.
I don't know how we'll get in.

01:21:25.665 --> 01:21:27.533
Hm. Whoa!

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:30.303
Oh, okay. I see a dungeon

01:21:30.436 --> 01:21:31.772
at the top of this ice wall.

01:21:31.905 --> 01:21:34.140
That must be where
they're keeping your grandpa.

01:21:34.273 --> 01:21:36.743
And Milo is probably
in this, like, barn thing

01:21:36.877 --> 01:21:38.879
all the way
on the other side of the place.

01:21:39.012 --> 01:21:41.113
Okay. We gotta split up.

01:21:41.247 --> 01:21:43.817
One team goes to get Milo,
the other busts out Grandpa.

01:21:43.951 --> 01:21:45.886
But how do we get in?

01:21:46.019 --> 01:21:47.386
Fridge, do you have

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.057
any ice-climbing equipment
in your backpack?

01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:54.093
You mean something like this?

01:21:54.226 --> 01:21:56.763
- Just like that.
- See?

01:21:56.897 --> 01:21:58.966
That's why
I'm the backpack guy.

01:21:59.098 --> 01:22:00.934
- That's why.
- Yeah. You're great at that.

01:22:01.068 --> 01:22:02.602
Yeah, I know.

01:22:02.736 --> 01:22:05.438
Martha,
will you come with me?

01:22:05.571 --> 01:22:07.273
Of course.

01:22:17.416 --> 01:22:20.319
I forgot
what this part feels like.

01:22:20.453 --> 01:22:22.154
It's scary.

01:22:23.356 --> 01:22:25.591
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:22:25.726 --> 01:22:28.561
We can do it.
This team can do anything.

01:22:30.129 --> 01:22:31.631
Nobody knows that
better than me.

01:22:31.765 --> 01:22:35.401
- Yeah.
- Come on, you guys.

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:36.737
Bring it in.

01:22:40.606 --> 01:22:42.141
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

01:22:42.274 --> 01:22:43.677
<i>Be, be aggressive.</i>

01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:45.112
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

01:22:45.244 --> 01:22:47.613
<i>Be, be aggressive.
Come on, guys.</i>

01:22:47.748 --> 01:22:49.582
That's not what
I thought this was. No.

01:22:49.716 --> 01:22:50.650
We should just go.

01:22:50.784 --> 01:22:53.185
Okay, just... Go, team.

01:23:08.969 --> 01:23:10.003
Okay.

01:23:10.137 --> 01:23:11.872
I'm gonna try
to sneak in with them.

01:23:12.005 --> 01:23:14.941
In this outfit, I might be able
to pass. You guys stay here...

01:23:15.075 --> 01:23:16.743
What? No way.

01:23:16.877 --> 01:23:18.244
Now's the moment. Stay here.

01:23:18.377 --> 01:23:20.714
- Alex, no!
- Go. Good luck, Alex.

01:23:23.884 --> 01:23:25.184
Come on.

01:23:25.317 --> 01:23:27.520
What are you talking about,
"Come on"? Bethany.

01:23:27.653 --> 01:23:28.822
Bethany!

01:23:32.291 --> 01:23:34.161
Turn right.

01:23:50.711 --> 01:23:53.212
You there. Stay where you are.

01:23:53.345 --> 01:23:54.681
Who, us?

01:23:54.815 --> 01:23:57.718
Are you the Brothers Kababik?

01:23:57.851 --> 01:24:01.520
- Are we the who?
- Are you the Brothers Kababik?

01:24:01.654 --> 01:24:03.255
Yes.

01:24:03.389 --> 01:24:05.591
We are them. It is we. Us.

01:24:05.726 --> 01:24:09.628
We are the Brothers Cadabra...
Kadabrik.

01:24:09.763 --> 01:24:11.597
He is one brother,

01:24:11.732 --> 01:24:15.401
and I am the other brother.

01:24:15.534 --> 01:24:18.471
We... We got different mothers.

01:24:18.604 --> 01:24:22.909
But we, uh... We came to get
the thing that we came to get.

01:24:25.377 --> 01:24:26.680
Brothers Kababik,

01:24:26.813 --> 01:24:28.581
on behalf of Jurgen the Brutal,

01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:31.017
welcome to Zhatmire Stronghold.

01:24:31.151 --> 01:24:33.053
Ah, thank you.

01:24:51.905 --> 01:24:54.908
There's something
I have to ask you.

01:24:55.041 --> 01:24:56.408
Okay.

01:24:56.542 --> 01:24:59.378
Why didn't you come visit
when you were supposed to?

01:24:59.512 --> 01:25:01.214
You canceled the first time,

01:25:01.347 --> 01:25:04.050
then you were gonna come
for Halloween. You cancel again.

01:25:04.184 --> 01:25:05.752
Then the next time
I hear from you,

01:25:05.886 --> 01:25:07.754
you tell me
we should take a break?

01:25:11.091 --> 01:25:14.261
It's just... I saw all
your pictures on Instagram,

01:25:14.393 --> 01:25:17.296
and you looked like you
were having so much fun, and...

01:25:17.429 --> 01:25:20.867
I just got really insecure
or something.

01:25:21.001 --> 01:25:24.237
Like I wasn't the guy
I thought I was.

01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:27.007
Or I wasn't the guy
you thought I was.

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.441
Which would be even worse.

01:25:29.575 --> 01:25:32.779
Spencer,
do you think I'm not...

01:25:32.913 --> 01:25:35.816
totally terrified
all the time?

01:25:35.949 --> 01:25:37.818
I got to school,
and suddenly,

01:25:37.951 --> 01:25:41.888
for the first time ever,
people really liked me.

01:25:42.022 --> 01:25:43.990
But I'm always thinking that...

01:25:44.124 --> 01:25:46.325
I don't know, like it's...

01:25:46.458 --> 01:25:47.961
Like it's just a matter of time

01:25:48.094 --> 01:25:51.164
before somebody figures out
who I really am.

01:25:51.298 --> 01:25:52.531
But then I see you.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.403
And you're the person
who makes me feel good...

01:25:57.536 --> 01:25:59.005
about who I really am.

01:26:00.372 --> 01:26:03.576
When you're, like,
scared and insecure,

01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:06.545
that's when you need
your people the most.

01:26:17.623 --> 01:26:18.524
Hey, Mr. Walker.

01:26:20.359 --> 01:26:21.895
Why the long face?

01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:26.632
Dad joke. Sorry.
Can't help it.

01:26:28.268 --> 01:26:31.071
Let's get you out of here.

01:26:59.398 --> 01:27:00.599
Okay.

01:27:00.734 --> 01:27:03.069
It's just an obstacle course.

01:27:03.203 --> 01:27:04.771
You were good at those.

01:27:20.519 --> 01:27:23.023
All right,
all right, get a room.

01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.595
Grandpa...
let's get you out of there.

01:27:29.729 --> 01:27:31.765
Here.

01:27:31.898 --> 01:27:34.734
- Unh!
- Whoa.

01:27:34.868 --> 01:27:36.736
Let's blow this joint, huh?

01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:38.637
We still have
to find the jewel.

01:27:38.772 --> 01:27:41.241
It must be in a vault
or treasure room or something.

01:27:41.374 --> 01:27:43.343
Yeah, that's how
it works in these games.

01:27:43.475 --> 01:27:45.511
I passed a vault
on the way up to this dump.

01:27:45.644 --> 01:27:47.948
Single access,
3-foot-thick steel door.

01:27:48.081 --> 01:27:50.616
Only way in is through
a grate in the ceiling.

01:27:58.992 --> 01:28:02.461
Hoo... Oh. Huh.

01:28:02.594 --> 01:28:04.297
I think I got it now.

01:28:06.632 --> 01:28:09.468
Just stay on...

01:28:09.601 --> 01:28:10.804
the raised ones.

01:28:33.927 --> 01:28:36.363
Jurgen the Brutal awaits.

01:28:38.630 --> 01:28:42.668
So, tell me,
which brother is which?

01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:47.140
Um, how do you mean?

01:28:47.273 --> 01:28:50.143
Which brother is which?

01:28:50.276 --> 01:28:53.512
Which of you is Augustus
and which is Tomatoli?

01:28:55.015 --> 01:28:58.785
Um... I am Augustus.

01:29:00.086 --> 01:29:02.055
And I'm Tomatolik.

01:29:03.423 --> 01:29:06.192
Augustus Kababik.

01:29:06.326 --> 01:29:08.527
The cleverest man
in all of Jumanji.

01:29:10.096 --> 01:29:11.998
Yes, I'm totally that man.

01:29:12.132 --> 01:29:14.868
- And Tomatoli Kababik.
- That's me.

01:29:15.001 --> 01:29:17.470
The bravest eunuch.

01:29:17.636 --> 01:29:20.707
- Wait a minute, what?
- Did you say, "Eunuch"?

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.510
Tomatoli Kababik,
everyone knows the tale

01:29:23.642 --> 01:29:26.146
of your great
and generous sacrifice.

01:29:26.279 --> 01:29:28.381
How you gave your testicles

01:29:28.515 --> 01:29:31.351
in order to save the region
from the floods.

01:29:31.484 --> 01:29:32.886
There might be
a little confusion.

01:29:33.019 --> 01:29:34.620
Of course.
Everybody knows the story

01:29:34.754 --> 01:29:38.191
about my little brother
and his famous testicles.

01:29:38.324 --> 01:29:41.593
- Wherever they may be.
- Wherever they may be.

01:29:41.728 --> 01:29:44.297
All right, let's back up.
Let's go back a little bit.

01:29:44.431 --> 01:29:46.565
- Let's clear some stuff up.
- He's super brave.

01:29:46.699 --> 01:29:48.735
I've always been
the super clever one,

01:29:48.868 --> 01:29:50.970
and he's always been
super brave.

01:29:51.104 --> 01:29:53.239
- And super ball-less.
- Stop saying that!

01:29:53.373 --> 01:29:55.742
- Both of my balls are right here!
- In spirit.

01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:58.745
- Hey...
- They're here in spirit.

01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:01.114
Always.

01:30:02.182 --> 01:30:03.116
Of course.

01:30:04.184 --> 01:30:05.151
Right, bro?

01:30:10.423 --> 01:30:12.425
Right.

01:30:12.559 --> 01:30:15.328
I got no balls.

01:30:21.034 --> 01:30:23.136
There's the chest.

01:30:23.269 --> 01:30:25.205
Okay. You're up, Grandpa.

01:30:25.338 --> 01:30:27.974
- Who, me?
- Yes. You're the cat burglar.

01:30:28.108 --> 01:30:30.343
- Huh?
- Your character, Ming.

01:30:30.477 --> 01:30:32.178
- Ming?
- Yes, Ming.

01:30:32.312 --> 01:30:33.713
Your avatar.
That's her name.

01:30:33.847 --> 01:30:35.482
In your satchel,
you have lockpicks.

01:30:35.614 --> 01:30:38.251
Lockpicks?
Why would I have lockpicks?

01:30:38.384 --> 01:30:40.652
Because Ming's the cat burglar.

01:30:40.787 --> 01:30:42.755
Don't you think one
of you should do this?

01:30:42.889 --> 01:30:45.125
- You have the skills.
- I have the skills?

01:30:45.258 --> 01:30:47.827
Not you. Ming.

01:30:47.961 --> 01:30:49.896
Right. Ming.

01:30:51.564 --> 01:30:53.632
Please don't ask who Ming is.

01:31:03.977 --> 01:31:05.478
Not bad, huh?

01:31:07.313 --> 01:31:10.316
Now we just gotta figure out
how to get you out of here.

01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:22.362
Shall we?

01:31:24.964 --> 01:31:26.499
Huh.

01:31:26.633 --> 01:31:28.001
Now, that's cool.

01:31:31.971 --> 01:31:35.642
Welcome. May I offer you
a piece of cake?

01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:38.011
No! No!

01:31:38.144 --> 01:31:39.646
No!

01:31:43.449 --> 01:31:44.817
No, thank you.

01:31:55.461 --> 01:31:56.763
Steady.

01:32:10.143 --> 01:32:13.947
Ha! I'd like to see
your friend Ming do that!

01:32:19.252 --> 01:32:21.054
We got an issue here.

01:32:23.489 --> 01:32:25.258
Oh, thank you.

01:32:28.027 --> 01:32:29.629
Thank you.

01:32:37.770 --> 01:32:41.341
Brothers Kababik,
I present Jurgen the Brutal.

01:32:51.251 --> 01:32:52.619
At last,

01:32:52.752 --> 01:32:56.222
we meet on this historic day.

01:32:56.356 --> 01:33:00.526
Yes, it is so great
to meet you.

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:04.063
Your Honor, if that be
the Falcon Jewel

01:33:04.197 --> 01:33:08.234
upon your thick and meaty neck,

01:33:08.368 --> 01:33:10.536
perhaps we should...

01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:12.205
take it.

01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:16.609
Today we forge
an unbreakable alliance.

01:33:16.744 --> 01:33:19.212
Your family will join me,

01:33:19.345 --> 01:33:23.983
and land by land,
we'll take the world.

01:33:24.117 --> 01:33:27.487
So I ask, on this historic day,

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.155
where is she?

01:33:30.724 --> 01:33:33.159
- Uh, where's who?
- Who you talking about?

01:33:33.293 --> 01:33:35.094
Your sister.

01:33:35.228 --> 01:33:36.896
Soon to be my bride.

01:33:40.333 --> 01:33:45.204
You know what? I think that
there's been a misunderstanding.

01:33:45.338 --> 01:33:47.140
Where is your sister?

01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:52.545
Which sister were
we talking about?

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.449
Debbie or... Brooke?

01:33:56.582 --> 01:33:58.518
Or Sierra?

01:33:58.651 --> 01:34:02.322
Where is your sister?

01:34:04.424 --> 01:34:06.826
She's getting ready,
back at the hotel.

01:34:06.959 --> 01:34:09.329
She's doing what brides do
on their wedding day.

01:34:09.462 --> 01:34:13.366
Hanging with the girls, getting
her hair done, mani-pedi.

01:34:15.935 --> 01:34:18.739
If you come here
without your sister...

01:34:21.507 --> 01:34:23.576
I just might have
to cut off your heads.

01:34:23.711 --> 01:34:25.878
- Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

01:34:26.012 --> 01:34:27.513
- God, no.
- Hey, get off!

01:34:27.647 --> 01:34:31.184
- No. No.
- So I'll ask one last time:

01:34:31.317 --> 01:34:34.520
- Getting a mani-pedi!
- Where is your sister?

01:34:34.654 --> 01:34:36.422
I'm right here.

01:34:44.497 --> 01:34:47.667
Gwendolyn Hortencia
Lewelda Kababik?

01:34:47.801 --> 01:34:48.802
Is that you?

01:34:48.935 --> 01:34:51.404
Um, yes.

01:34:51.537 --> 01:34:52.672
That is me.

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:55.308
Now, please,

01:34:55.441 --> 01:34:59.078
O Brutal One,
release my brothers.

01:35:02.315 --> 01:35:04.584
And is it your
intention, on this day,

01:35:04.718 --> 01:35:08.654
at this hour, to wed
Jurgen the Brutal of Zhatmire?

01:35:10.323 --> 01:35:12.492
Yep. That's my plan.

01:35:12.625 --> 01:35:15.361
And is it your intention
to mother his children

01:35:15.495 --> 01:35:18.498
and forge in blood
this union with your family?

01:35:20.566 --> 01:35:21.601
Yes.

01:35:21.735 --> 01:35:23.737
Gwendolyn Kababik...

01:35:23.871 --> 01:35:25.739
known throughout the world

01:35:25.873 --> 01:35:28.574
for your beauty and cunning.

01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:32.211
And now you're mine.

01:35:35.381 --> 01:35:39.787
Um... May I hold
the Falcon Jewel?

01:35:41.254 --> 01:35:43.956
Of course, my bride.

01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:45.759
Thank you.

01:35:47.226 --> 01:35:48.161
Get it.

01:35:51.297 --> 01:35:53.065
Jurgen the Brutal!

01:35:53.199 --> 01:35:57.738
The Brothers Kababik
have been delayed in Gorek.

01:35:57.871 --> 01:36:00.072
These are impostors!

01:36:00.206 --> 01:36:01.909
- Impostors?
- Seize them!

01:36:02.041 --> 01:36:03.844
No, no, no.
Oh, no. We can explain.

01:36:03.976 --> 01:36:05.011
Oh, no, no, no.

01:36:05.144 --> 01:36:07.113
I forgot to tell you one thing.

01:36:09.282 --> 01:36:10.684
I have a boyfriend.

01:36:22.962 --> 01:36:24.430
Get back.
Stay back.

01:36:24.564 --> 01:36:26.365
- Stay away.
- Get back!

01:36:26.499 --> 01:36:28.468
Get back!

01:36:47.153 --> 01:36:50.990
- Get out of here!
- I will torch you, bitches.

01:36:51.123 --> 01:36:53.192
I will literally
burn your face.

01:37:15.314 --> 01:37:17.517
I'll meet the brothers
in Gorek.

01:37:17.650 --> 01:37:18.685
Kill them all!

01:37:21.187 --> 01:37:22.622
Go get him!

01:37:22.756 --> 01:37:23.790
Go get the jewel!

01:37:23.924 --> 01:37:25.993
Don't worry about us. Just go!

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.328
Backpack.

01:37:32.131 --> 01:37:35.002
Get away! I know geometry.

01:37:35.134 --> 01:37:38.237
I'm not messing around,
you guys. Get away!

01:37:38.371 --> 01:37:40.406
Fridge, we're gonna die!

01:37:51.551 --> 01:37:53.519
Anybody wanna dance
with the bride?

01:38:59.853 --> 01:39:02.923
You want a piece?
Come on!

01:39:08.895 --> 01:39:10.229
Nunchucks.

01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:24.243
Awesome

01:39:29.816 --> 01:39:31.183
We did it.

01:39:31.317 --> 01:39:32.753
Let's go!

01:39:42.095 --> 01:39:43.830
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

01:39:57.010 --> 01:39:59.545
Whoa! Unh! Whoa!

01:40:05.518 --> 01:40:07.054
Look!

01:40:08.387 --> 01:40:10.057
- Is that Spencer?
- Oh, my God.

01:41:00.741 --> 01:41:02.241
No!

01:41:07.981 --> 01:41:08.882
Spencer!

01:41:09.015 --> 01:41:10.349
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:41:17.758 --> 01:41:20.060
Who are you?

01:41:25.766 --> 01:41:27.868
I'm Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

01:41:53.226 --> 01:41:55.561
Spencer!

01:41:57.596 --> 01:41:59.966
- He says to get on his back.
- Who, me?

01:42:32.699 --> 01:42:34.667
Oh, no. Milo!

01:42:34.801 --> 01:42:36.069
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing?

01:42:36.203 --> 01:42:37.237
Wait.

01:42:38.504 --> 01:42:40.040
Milo!

01:42:48.882 --> 01:42:50.317
Yeah, Milo!

01:42:51.952 --> 01:42:53.186
Go!

01:42:55.856 --> 01:42:57.590
We're coming, Spencer!

01:43:01.527 --> 01:43:03.362
"Show it to the sun."

01:43:03.495 --> 01:43:04.798
Grandpa, the jewel!

01:43:04.931 --> 01:43:07.968
You gotta show it
to the sun! Get ready!

01:43:14.506 --> 01:43:16.743
Come on, Milo!

01:43:16.877 --> 01:43:19.012
- Go!
- Come on, come on!

01:43:33.326 --> 01:43:34.928
Yeah!

01:43:45.338 --> 01:43:47.340
- Call out its name.
- Call out its name.

01:43:47.473 --> 01:43:49.009
Call out its name!

01:43:49.142 --> 01:43:51.845
Jumanji!

01:43:51.978 --> 01:43:55.081
Jumanji!

01:43:55.215 --> 01:43:56.182
What'd they say?

01:43:58.484 --> 01:43:59.618
Jumanji?

01:44:04.758 --> 01:44:05.959
Oh!

01:44:28.547 --> 01:44:31.583
- Oh!
- Yes!

01:44:31.718 --> 01:44:33.519
Ha, ha, we won!

01:44:33.652 --> 01:44:35.322
- We did it!
- Hey.

01:44:36.622 --> 01:44:38.692
Put me down.

01:44:38.825 --> 01:44:40.492
- Put me down, goddamn it. Stop!
- Okay.

01:44:40.626 --> 01:44:43.296
Is this what you were
looking for? This little thing?

01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:45.031
Grandpa, you guys
were incredible.

01:44:45.165 --> 01:44:48.768
Yeah, that's the thing about
Milo. He's got a lot of skills.

01:44:48.902 --> 01:44:50.170
Milo and Eddie.

01:44:51.805 --> 01:44:53.139
Milo and Eddie.

01:44:59.779 --> 01:45:02.215
Uh, what are we doing
here now?

01:45:09.255 --> 01:45:10.757
Whoa!

01:45:12.826 --> 01:45:14.694
Well done,
intrepid adventurers.

01:45:14.828 --> 01:45:17.464
You have saved Jumanji.
Again.

01:45:18.798 --> 01:45:20.266
And now,
with your permission,

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.303
Dr. Bravestone,
I will take the jewel from here.

01:45:23.436 --> 01:45:26.172
I will protect it with my life
and return it to the care

01:45:26.306 --> 01:45:28.640
of the elder
at the Avian Province.

01:45:28.775 --> 01:45:30.944
And so your work here is done.

01:45:31.077 --> 01:45:34.881
All of Jumanji thanks you. And,
sadly, this is where we part.

01:45:35.015 --> 01:45:36.515
I don't know
what's sad about it.

01:45:36.648 --> 01:45:38.550
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

01:45:42.922 --> 01:45:43.957
What?

01:45:45.792 --> 01:45:47.460
Really?

01:45:49.661 --> 01:45:51.663
Hey, guys, you're not gonna
believe this.

01:45:51.798 --> 01:45:54.300
What'd he say?

01:45:54.434 --> 01:45:56.668
- He says that he...
- He wants to stay.

01:45:58.604 --> 01:46:02.641
He says somebody's gotta stay
and look after this place.

01:46:02.776 --> 01:46:05.745
And that he's 75 years old
and he just learned how to fly.

01:46:09.049 --> 01:46:11.451
But he won't be able
to get out.

01:46:12.819 --> 01:46:14.020
He knows.

01:46:17.857 --> 01:46:19.692
Oh, Milo.

01:46:23.096 --> 01:46:26.066
I feel like I, uh,
just got you back.

01:46:26.199 --> 01:46:27.901
Now I'm losing you for good.

01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:33.773
"You're not losing me, buddy.
I'll always be with you."

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.415
Being your partner...

01:46:42.549 --> 01:46:46.152
is one of the best things
I ever got to be.

01:46:48.721 --> 01:46:50.290
He says, "Thank you."

01:46:50.423 --> 01:46:52.225
No, no.

01:46:52.358 --> 01:46:54.260
Thank you, Milo.

01:47:22.621 --> 01:47:24.324
Yes!

01:47:24.457 --> 01:47:26.259
- Take care, Milo!
- Bye!

01:47:26.392 --> 01:47:27.626
- Go, Milo!
- So long, Milo!

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.429
Bye-bye, Mr. Walker!

01:47:32.765 --> 01:47:34.901
That's my partner right there.

01:47:40.807 --> 01:47:44.110
Everybody should be so lucky
to have a friend like Milo.

01:47:59.993 --> 01:48:02.795
Come on, Grandpa. Let's go home.

01:48:07.333 --> 01:48:08.601
Hey, guys.

01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:13.139
Thanks for coming to get me.

01:48:18.111 --> 01:48:20.880
You do it again, your ass
is gonna be stuck here, Spencer!

01:48:21.014 --> 01:48:22.348
'Cause I'm not coming back!

01:48:45.405 --> 01:48:46.773
Everybody okay?

01:48:48.374 --> 01:48:49.943
Yeah.

01:48:50.076 --> 01:48:51.578
Grandpa,
you okay?

01:48:53.213 --> 01:48:54.948
Yeah, I'm good.

01:48:56.883 --> 01:48:58.952
Holy shit.

01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:14.667
Strike. Square one.
Counterstrike.

01:49:14.801 --> 01:49:16.269
The fat one on the bottom?

01:49:16.402 --> 01:49:18.671
The fat...
No, the fat one above the R.

01:49:18.805 --> 01:49:19.973
- Okay.
- Atop number two.

01:49:20.106 --> 01:49:22.542
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So strike, strike.

01:49:22.676 --> 01:49:24.744
- Yeah.
- Counterstrike.

01:49:24.877 --> 01:49:27.547
Then kick me. O.

01:49:31.751 --> 01:49:33.086
Let me tell you something.

01:49:33.219 --> 01:49:36.422
- Getting old...
- I know. Getting old sucks.

01:49:38.358 --> 01:49:39.759
Getting old...

01:49:42.895 --> 01:49:44.297
...is a gift.

01:49:46.734 --> 01:49:49.068
I forget that
sometimes.

01:49:50.169 --> 01:49:51.604
But it is.

01:49:55.908 --> 01:49:58.311
What more
could a guy possibly want?

01:50:04.417 --> 01:50:06.319
Hey, guys.

01:50:06.452 --> 01:50:08.321
How was your day?

01:50:08.454 --> 01:50:10.823
It was really great.

01:50:10.957 --> 01:50:12.625
Yeah.

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.729
Spencer taught me
how to play a video game.

01:50:30.243 --> 01:50:31.611
Oh, hell, no.

01:50:43.323 --> 01:50:44.891
You okay, Grandpa?

01:50:47.695 --> 01:50:48.961
Yeah.

01:50:49.095 --> 01:50:51.197
A lot of good memories here.

01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:03.876
Eddie.

01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:05.713
Eddie, is that you?

01:51:05.845 --> 01:51:07.246
Nora.

01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:09.148
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

01:51:09.282 --> 01:51:10.149
Hey, guys.

01:51:10.283 --> 01:51:11.484
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:51:12.985 --> 01:51:14.387
What's up, bro?

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:17.090
So how's business?

01:51:17.223 --> 01:51:18.692
Oh, you know how it is.

01:51:18.826 --> 01:51:21.961
My manager quit six months
ago, moved to Philly.

01:51:22.095 --> 01:51:24.664
Place has been kind of
a mess ever since.

01:51:24.798 --> 01:51:28.334
It's hard to find people
who really know how to do this.

01:51:28.468 --> 01:51:30.636
Oh, well...

01:51:30.771 --> 01:51:32.706
I don't have to tell you this.

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.708
Mm.

01:51:36.209 --> 01:51:37.977
So you need some help
around here?

01:51:39.545 --> 01:51:40.913
You mean it?

01:51:41.047 --> 01:51:43.082
I mean, I...

01:51:43.216 --> 01:51:44.650
I'd be honored.

01:51:44.785 --> 01:51:46.185
Well...

01:51:48.354 --> 01:51:50.189
It's really good
to see you, Eddie.

01:51:51.457 --> 01:51:52.726
Likewise.

01:51:57.397 --> 01:51:58.766
Um...

01:52:03.002 --> 01:52:06.105
Um, I'm... I'm gonna take this

01:52:06.239 --> 01:52:09.108
where I was going and...

01:52:09.242 --> 01:52:11.377
I'll be right back.

01:52:11.511 --> 01:52:13.946
You guys gotta come
to New York too.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.516
Yeah, I can't wait.

01:52:16.649 --> 01:52:19.185
This team, forever.

01:52:19.318 --> 01:52:20.586
Forever.

01:52:20.721 --> 01:52:22.488
Always.

01:52:22.622 --> 01:52:25.124
Uh, always and forever?

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:29.629
- Yeah, let's keep close though.
- Of course, yeah.

01:52:29.763 --> 01:52:31.264
One thing.

01:52:31.397 --> 01:52:32.932
Can we all agree?

01:52:33.065 --> 01:52:34.835
Let's never go back there.

01:52:34.967 --> 01:52:36.936
- We already agreed on that.
- That's fine.

01:53:17.643 --> 01:53:19.045
Sorry it's so late.

01:53:19.178 --> 01:53:20.613
Yeah, it's that time of year.

01:53:20.747 --> 01:53:23.115
- Everyone's heaters are broken.
- Oh, it's no problem.

01:53:23.249 --> 01:53:24.785
I'm just glad you made it.

01:53:24.918 --> 01:53:26.687
The furnace
is right over here.

01:53:31.792 --> 01:53:34.193
Is that
an old video game console?

01:53:34.327 --> 01:53:36.095
Hm?

01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:38.164
Oh, yeah, probably.

01:53:38.297 --> 01:53:40.500
It belongs to my son.

01:53:40.633 --> 01:53:42.101
Hm.

01:53:42.235 --> 01:53:44.705
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

01:53:44.838 --> 01:53:46.672
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:53:51.845 --> 01:53:53.680
Well, it looks like
it's broken.

01:53:55.081 --> 01:53:57.784
Maybe you shouldn't
touch it.
