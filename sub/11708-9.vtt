{\an8}ARE YOU READY?
- YEAH.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.122
{\an8}- OH, I HAVE TO GET
MY STUFF.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.708
{\an8}- FOR MY ONE YEAR,
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.209
{\an8}I JUST FIGURE
I'M GONNA GO FUN.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.252

10:29.295 --> 10:31.547
{\an8}LAID OUT ON THE BED.

{\an8}- ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT HE WAS
A LITTLE SKETCHY AT FIRST.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.232
{\an8}- FOR WHATEVER REASON,
I JUST LOOK AT JOEY

11:31.315 --> 11:33.567

YOU DON'T GET IT.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.745
{\an8}LIKE, DON'T, LIKE,
TRY AND RAIN ON MY PARADE.

11:44.829 --> 11:45.788
{\an8}I DON'T THINK
HE'S LIKE THAT.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.790
{\an8}- IT'S YOUR LIFE,
THAT'S IT.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.208
{\an8}- YEAH, I DON'T REALLY CARE.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.292
{\an8}- I WANNA MAKE SURE
MY FRIEND KNOWS

12:09.353 --> 12:10.813
{\an8}DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
HE LIKES HER?

12:10.896 --> 12:12.148

I SAID TO MYSELF,

13:11.081 --> 13:14.793
{\an8}"UH, TODAY'S GONNA BE

{\an8}MYTHICAL PROPORTIONS TODAY.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.479
{\an8}UH, I NEED AN N-25, N-25.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.023
{\an8}10 BACK, 15 BACK.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.983
{\an8}- MIKE, WHY DON'T
YOU HAVE A SHIRT ON, MAN?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.778
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN BUSY WORKING HARD.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.488
{\an8}I'M JUST MAKING
SALE AFTER SALE.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.574
{\an8}BLACK SWEATSHIRT RIGHT HERE.
IS THIS ALL YOU GOT?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.409
{\an8}- CAN'T YOU JUST GO ON
THE FLOOR AND MAKE SOME SALES?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.787
{\an8}- NO, I DO THE PRESS.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.915
{\an8}- AND THIS IS, UH, 25.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.750
{\an8}- HOLY SHIT.

13:54.833 --> 13:55.334
{\an8}MIKE IS ACTUALLY
WORKING TODAY.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.586
{\an8}I'M SURPRISED.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.837
{\an8}- THANKS, MIKE.

14:02.007 --> 14:02.758
{\an8}- YO, PAULY D,
WHAT'S GOOD?

14:02.841 --> 14:05.553
{\an8}- IS IT POSSIBLE
TO BE TOO FRESH?

14:05.636 --> 14:07.555
{\an8}BECAUSE IF IT IS, I AM,

14:07.638 --> 14:08.264
{\an8}AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
DROWNED OUT BY MY FRESHNESS.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.265
{\an8}- LET'S GO.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.934
{\an8}SHOTS ON ME.

14:12.017 --> 14:12.935
{\an8}- EJ'S?

14:13.018 --> 14:16.397
{\an8}- JUST GONNA GO PLAY POOL
AT EJ'S.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.859
{\an8}I WAS KILLING IT
IN POOL YESTERDAY.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.152
{\an8}- YEAH?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.445
{\an8}YOU WERE PLAYING SNOOKI.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.908
{\an8}YOU GOT QUARTERS?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.743
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT VINNY,

14:29.827 --> 14:31.078
{\an8}'CAUSE RIGHT NOW
THERE'S NO SINGLE PEOPLE

14:31.161 --> 14:32.121
{\an8}IN THIS HOUSE BASICALLY.

14:32.204 --> 14:32.705
{\an8}- I JUST THINK
IF EVERYONE WAS SINGLE,

14:32.788 --> 14:34.623
{\an8}IT WOULD BE LIKE--

14:34.707 --> 14:35.624
{\an8}IT WOULD BE FUN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:35.708 --> 14:36.792
{\an8}- 'CAUSE EVERYBODY
WILL BE SINGLE,

14:36.875 --> 14:38.252
{\an8}BRING THEIR SINGLE FRIENDS.
- EXACTLY.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.295
{\an8}- THERE WILL BE ALL SINGLE
GIRLS ALL OVER THE PLACE,

14:39.378 --> 14:41.714
{\an8}AND THEN WE JUST GO OUT,
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.008
{\an8}YEAH, BUDDY.

{\an8}- WHAT?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.095
{\an8}- IT'S HER AND ROGER'S
ANNIVERSARY.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.557
{\an8}SO THEY'RE--SHE DECORATED
THE SMUSH ROOM

14:51.640 --> 14:53.892
{\an8}AS, LIKE, ALL DECORATED
FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.311
{\an8}- OH, NICE AND CLASSY.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.478
{\an8}- GET THEIR OWN SHORE HOUSE.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.230
{\an8}IT'S LIKE COUPLES' RETREAT.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.108
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP IN THE HOUSE.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.359
{\an8}YOU KNOW?

15:02.443 --> 15:04.028
{\an8}- THAT'S WHY WE'RE
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.822
{\an8}- YO, GAME.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.991
{\an8}DOUBLE GAME.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.452
{\an8}- YEAH, SOMEONE GOT
BOOTY SHORTS.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.579
{\an8}YOU CAN GET STUFF
ON THE FRONT OR THE BACK.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.999
{\an8}- EXCUSE ME, JERK.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.792
{\an8}- WHO GOT BOOTY SHORTS?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.586
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD, I'M HAVING SEX
TONIGHT AFTER KARMA.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.671
{\an8}THANK GOD. SHIT.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.674
{\an8}- I HAVE, LIKE, NIGHTMARES.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.844
{\an8}- NICOLE, MIKE, RONNIE,

15:31.430 --> 15:34.016
{\an8}- DON'T PEE ON THE FLOOR!

15:34.099 --> 15:35.643
{\an8}- DURING BREAK, I'M JUST GONNA
CHILL BACK AND RELAX.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.853
{\an8}- YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO ANYWHERE?

15:37.936 --> 15:39.104
{\an8}- I'M CHILLING BACK.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.064
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS GO.
I'M GONNA CHILL BACK.

15:40.147 --> 15:45.110
{\an8}I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
IN A LITTLE BIT.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.695
{\an8}- YOU WANNA GO ON A RIDE?

15:46.779 --> 15:47.738
{\an8}- YEAH, I'LL DO THAT.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.948
{\an8}[dialing, line rings]

15:50.032 --> 15:51.450
{\an8}- YO.
- YO!

15:51.533 --> 15:53.160
{\an8}- WHAT UP, DUDE?
- WHAT UP, MY DUDE?

15:53.243 --> 15:56.538
{\an8}TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
- YEAH, HE'S AROUND?

15:56.622 --> 15:59.875
{\an8}- YEAH, I GOTTA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE THERE,

15:59.958 --> 16:01.835
{\an8}'CAUSE I KNOW
HE'S GONNA BE THERE.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.380
{\an8}AND WE GOTTA MAKE IT HAPPEN
TONIGHT, MAN, YOU KNOW?

16:04.463 --> 16:05.839
{\an8}- LET'S DO IT.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.966
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO PLAN THIS MASTER PLAN

16:08.050 --> 16:10.552
{\an8}FOR A NUMBER OF WEEKS NOW.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.805
{\an8}AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
THE SUMMER IS ALMOST OVER.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.098
{\an8}IT'S GOT TO GO DOWN.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.809
{\an8}SHE TRIED TO PLAY ME
LIKE A CHESS PIECE RECENTLY,

16:16.892 --> 16:17.893
{\an8}SO THE GIRL'S
GOTTA GET HER MEDICINE,

16:17.976 --> 16:19.603
{\an8}SHE'S GOTTA GET
HER MEDICINE, THAT'S IT.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.814
{\an8}I DON'T LIE ABOUT THINGS.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.482
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY
NOT LEAVING THIS HOUSE

16:23.565 --> 16:25.859
{\an8}WITHOUT SHOWING PEOPLE
THAT I'M NOT A LIAR.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.779
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, BROTHER, PEACE.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.867
{\an8}- OH, THERE WE GO.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.745
{\an8}- HOW THE FUCK
ARE WE GONNA CARRY ALL THIS?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.248
{\an8}- WE GOT BACK TO THE HOUSE,
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.417
{\an8}I'M GONNA SHOWER,
THEN DECORATE THE SMUSH ROOM

16:41.500 --> 16:43.502
{\an8}WITH ROSE PETALS
AND BONDAGE EQUIPMENT.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.421
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
- JUST SAYING.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.672
{\an8}I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR
MY DATE WITH ROGER TONIGHT.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.966
{\an8}IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

16:49.049 --> 16:51.301
{\an8}BUT I'M JUST TRYING
TO KEEP IT FUN,

16:51.385 --> 16:53.595
{\an8}BECAUSE ME AND ROGER
AREN'T VERY ROMANTIC.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.265
{\an8}I'M SO GROSS,
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOWER.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.599
{\an8}- LATER, MY MAN.
- LATER, MAN.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.475
{\an8}- TAKE CARE, THANK YOU.
- ICE CREAM!

16:58.559 --> 17:00.561
{\an8}- [laughs]

17:00.644 --> 17:01.812
{\an8}WHAT'S OUR NEXT ORDER
OF BUSINESS?

17:01.895 --> 17:03.355
{\an8}DO YOU WANNA RETAKE,
RECLAIM THE SMUSH ROOM?

17:03.439 --> 17:06.233
{\an8}THE SMUSH ROOM IS SUPPOSED
TO BE FOR SINGLE PEOPLE,

17:06.316 --> 17:08.527
{\an8}NOT FOR EVERYBODY TO BRING IN
THEIR BOYFRIENDS EVERY NIGHT.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.029
{\an8}SO WE FOUND OUT A SOLUTION.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.239
{\an8}- IF WE TAKE THE BED OUT,

17:12.321 --> 17:13.781
{\an8}THE COUPLES WILL STOP USING
THE SMUSH ROOM.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.742
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

17:17.493 --> 17:19.788
{\an8}THIS IS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.749
{\an8}- SINGLE GANG OR DIE.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.958
{\an8}- YEAH, BUDDY.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.919
{\an8}- ME AND PAULY DO A LITTLE FIX
TO THE SMUSH ROOM.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.378
{\an8}IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT IT'S SOME KINDA MESSAGE
