00:12.539 --> 00:15.407
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:15.409 --> 00:17.509
- No!
- ... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:17.511 --> 00:20.245
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:20.247 --> 00:21.746

00:21.748 --> 00:24.249

is by working for the enemy.

- Yet.

00:31.036 --> 00:34.104
But you are one mutation away
from acquiring that ability.

00:34.106 --> 00:38.542
Jedikiah used brutal drug therapies
to fry out the part of the brain

00:38.544 --> 00:40.043
that blocks us from killing.

Ok.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.781
I'm pretty sure that guy was on to you.

Oh, relax. Here, for your
brother's steroid fund.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.553
- Football camp.
- Same difference.

03:26.555 --> 03:29.089
You said you needed
dough. This is how we do.

03:29.091 --> 03:30.891
Yeah, I just want to help out my mom,

03:30.893 --> 03:33.092
but if she knew I was hustling
pool, she would kill me.

03:33.094 --> 03:35.562
Hey, you guys wanna play a round?

03:35.564 --> 03:37.830
- I'm looking to break in my new rod.
- Uh, we were just leaving.

03:37.832 --> 03:42.101
It's called a cue, actually.
A Vinotchka, to be precise.

03:42.103 --> 03:45.472
That is a $10,000 rod.

- Piper.
- Charmed, Piper. Russell, Stephen.

03:49.077 --> 03:52.478
My dad's. He's got, like, a dozen of 'em.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.949
- Rich girls. Love 'em.
- Excuse us for just a second.

04:07.195 --> 04:09.995
Money? It'll make you a sharper player.

- It's cheaper than lessons.
- Go easy on me?

04:12.733 --> 04:13.699

- Now get the hell away from me.
- Okay, okay. Easy, Piper.

What were you two doing in a pool hall?

05:37.448 --> 05:40.616
Last time we went topside, three
of our own didn't come back.

05:40.618 --> 05:43.452
We were tracking new breakouts and stuff.

05:43.454 --> 05:45.854
- Did you explain to her who we were?
- We tried.

05:45.856 --> 05:47.508
Didn't have time to make our case.

05:47.509 --> 05:49.933
She was quick. Like a she-ninja.

05:49.964 --> 05:51.617
<i>TIM: I'm sorry to interrupt,</i>

05:51.618 --> 05:54.114
but I have some information for Russell.

05:54.161 --> 05:56.094
Lay it on me, Tim.

05:56.096 --> 05:59.197
In scanning the newsfeeds, I flagged
an item from the Portland Herald.

05:59.199 --> 06:02.034
Last night, a local resident
suffered a heart attack.

06:02.136 --> 06:06.138
His name was listed in the
obituary as Chan-Woo Kwon.

06:07.740 --> 06:09.941
He passed away this morning.

06:09.943 --> 06:11.075
That's my dad.

06:13.078 --> 06:16.047
- My God, Russell.
- No, uh... no, we...

06:17.449 --> 06:18.850
weren't that close.

06:24.890 --> 06:25.923
Excuse me.

06:33.165 --> 06:34.365
Think he's all right?

06:35.933 --> 06:37.468
He says he is, but...

06:38.770 --> 06:41.104
I think he just wants to be alone.

06:41.106 --> 06:44.208
Oh, man, of all the days for me
to roll him into going up top.

06:44.210 --> 06:46.943
Is there a good day to find
out your father passed away?

06:46.945 --> 06:48.812
Besides, if you two hadn't gone topside,

06:48.814 --> 06:51.048
we never would have found
out about the new breakout.

06:51.050 --> 06:53.884
Yes, thank you for reminding
me. I should have brought her in.

06:53.886 --> 06:55.418
I should have gotten a read on her.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.487
Look, we've all been a bit off lately.

06:57.489 --> 06:59.357
It's hard not to be when

06:59.358 --> 07:01.840
you watch your friends get
gunned down right in front of you.

07:03.127 --> 07:04.761
Irene.

07:04.763 --> 07:06.962
Oh, I went by the hospital to see my mom.

07:06.964 --> 07:08.484
Irene is out of the ICU,

07:08.485 --> 07:10.875
but they're keeping her sedated
until the swelling reduces.

07:11.002 --> 07:12.101
That's great.

07:13.437 --> 07:15.071
If they ID her,

07:15.073 --> 07:16.706
and they put her in the system...

07:16.708 --> 07:18.841
I will make sure she's
not on Ultra's radar.

07:21.478 --> 07:22.845
JOHN: Cara.

07:24.447 --> 07:25.480
Cara!

07:28.985 --> 07:31.020
Are we ever gonna talk about this?

07:31.022 --> 07:32.421
About what?

07:32.423 --> 07:36.992
Ever since you saw me take out that agent,

07:36.994 --> 07:38.360
you can barely look me in the eye.

07:38.362 --> 07:40.795
You think I'm upset because you can kill?

07:40.797 --> 07:42.455
You saved my life.

07:42.456 --> 07:44.740
That's not what's come between
us, John, I think you know that.

07:44.744 --> 07:46.535
- Then what?
- What else have you been protecting me from

07:46.537 --> 07:48.437
all this time?

07:48.439 --> 07:50.739
I can feel you blocking me out.

07:52.275 --> 07:53.942
What are you so afraid of?

07:55.311 --> 07:58.079
If everyone finds out that I can kill,

07:58.081 --> 07:59.948
that Jedikiah warped me,

07:59.950 --> 08:01.850
you think they'd still look up to me?

08:01.852 --> 08:04.152
Or would this whole place fall apart?

08:04.154 --> 08:05.787
That's what I'm afraid of, Cara.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.089
I don't believe you. There's more.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.360
Sorry.

08:12.362 --> 08:15.062
Didn't mean to interrupt. Going somewhere?

08:15.064 --> 08:17.064
Dad's funeral.

08:17.066 --> 08:18.832
Thought you said you weren't close.

08:18.834 --> 08:22.035
It just felt like I should be there.

08:22.037 --> 08:23.671
Closure and all.

08:23.673 --> 08:27.508
Russell, you know the rules.
No contact with our human lives.

08:27.510 --> 08:30.010
I gotta go home.

08:30.012 --> 08:33.113
- If it means that I'm not allowed back...
- It's okay.

08:33.115 --> 08:34.815
- You can go.
- Yeah?

08:34.817 --> 08:37.851
Yeah. But I'm going with you.

08:37.852 --> 08:40.453
You think I'm letting
you go cross-country solo?

08:40.455 --> 08:42.789
It takes multiple, long-range jumps.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.858
I've mapped out a network
of zones over the years

08:44.860 --> 08:47.093
where you can land safely,
lay low, and rest up.

08:47.095 --> 08:49.763
- Memorial's Saturday afternoon.
- We better get moving.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.435
You know, you can't run away
from this conversation, John.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.839
We'll talk when I get back.

08:59.841 --> 09:02.041
No one in or out of the lair until then.

09:36.389 --> 09:37.623
Who's this?

09:39.459 --> 09:42.761
I know she's a friend
of yours. Astrid Finch?

09:42.763 --> 09:45.564
(STAMMERING) Yeah. I've seen her around.

09:45.566 --> 09:47.866
She was at our last kill-squad op.

09:47.868 --> 09:49.700
She followed you, Stephen.

09:49.702 --> 09:53.171
If your uncle decides
that she's a liability...

09:53.173 --> 09:54.639
Okay, what do you want from me?

09:56.508 --> 09:58.243
Nothing.

09:58.245 --> 10:01.446
I'm gonna turn a blind eye this one time.

10:01.448 --> 10:03.315
But let's be perfectly clear.

10:03.317 --> 10:06.283
You cannot mix your old
life with your new life.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.555
- Do you understand?
- Yeah. Completely.

10:10.557 --> 10:13.558
Thank you for giving me a heads up.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.660
So, what's on tap for the night shift?

10:15.662 --> 10:16.459
It's pretty dead.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.556
We have a possible
breakout in Hell's Kitchen.

10:18.965 --> 10:21.198

10:30.442 --> 10:31.675
CARA: Stephen.

10:32.810 --> 10:34.711
- Something happen with Irene?
- No.

10:34.713 --> 10:37.281
She's safe for now, but our pool
hustler got herself on Ultra's radar.

10:37.283 --> 10:37.998
We gotta get a jump.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.997
No. No, Stephen, now is not the time.

10:40.686 --> 10:42.853
After everything that happened
the last time we went above ground,

10:42.855 --> 10:45.755
we have to choose our battles.

10:45.757 --> 10:48.312
Wow. That is amazing.

10:48.313 --> 10:50.322
John's halfway to Oregon.
Like he never left.

10:50.796 --> 10:52.896
- I will hurt you.
- Bring it.

10:52.898 --> 10:55.542
You wanna stick around minding
the store for your boyfriend?

10:55.543 --> 10:56.543
 That's cool.

10:56.734 --> 11:00.536
- Guess I'll have to find Piper myself.
- I am not "minding the store."

11:00.538 --> 11:02.938
Look, Cara, I know you
want to help this girl.

11:02.940 --> 11:05.371
Okay? And John is one guy and one opinion.

11:05.372 --> 11:07.287
You're a leader here, too.

11:07.879 --> 11:09.545
Why don't you do what you think is right?

11:16.620 --> 11:17.920
(CLATTERING)

11:20.557 --> 11:21.624

11:31.967 --> 11:33.435
Where the hell are we?

11:33.437 --> 11:37.239
An abandoned industrial
park outside of Akron, Ohio.

11:37.241 --> 11:40.542
I was more talking about
the metal box we're inside.

11:40.544 --> 11:43.678
I hid out here once when
I was chasing a breakout.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.814
We'll be safe for tonight.

11:46.816 --> 11:48.919
So, when was the last
time you saw your dad?

11:48.920 --> 11:50.330
Couple years ago, maybe?

11:50.687 --> 11:53.220
Like I said, we weren't close.

11:55.357 --> 11:58.492
When I was a kid, five,

11:58.494 --> 12:01.929
I sat down at a piano
and I could just play.

12:01.931 --> 12:07.701
And my dad got it into his head that
I was destined to be a famous pianist.

12:07.703 --> 12:11.505
- Are you any good?- Hells yeah.

12:11.507 --> 12:13.790
It's hard not to be with
what he put me through.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.318
Six hours a day of practice.

12:15.478 --> 12:18.378
- Eight on weekends.
- Sounds intense.

12:18.380 --> 12:19.913
That's my old man.

12:21.716 --> 12:22.716
Was.

12:24.886 --> 12:27.788
If your dad was such a
tyrant, why are we doing this?

12:31.693 --> 12:32.926
Sorry.

12:38.432 --> 12:42.335
Uh-uh, pal. Boss don't like you.

12:42.337 --> 12:44.437
(STAMMERING) What did I do?

12:44.439 --> 12:47.540
You walked out with 30 grand
last week. That's what you did.

12:59.019 --> 13:00.853
MAN 1: (THINKING) Pair of sevens. Garbage.

13:06.192 --> 13:07.426
<i>MAN 2: (THINKING) No way I'm bluffing.</i>

13:15.401 --> 13:17.269
<i>MAN 3: (THINKING) Luckiest
kid I've ever seen.</i>

13:19.872 --> 13:20.872
Call.

13:25.878 --> 13:28.680
- Again? No, no.
- It's my lucky day.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.248
- No way.
- I should go.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.449
There's nothing lucky about cheating.

13:41.293 --> 13:42.860
Where's the rest of it?

13:42.862 --> 13:46.531
The 30 grand you walked out
with last time. Where is it?

13:46.533 --> 13:48.932
(STAMMERING) At home. I'll get it. I swear!

13:48.934 --> 13:51.769
I want an address. Now!

13:51.771 --> 13:55.606
You don't understand. My dad,
if he finds out, he'll kill me.

13:55.608 --> 13:57.207
What do you think I'm gonna do to you?

14:03.414 --> 14:04.514
What the hell?

14:11.289 --> 14:13.673
Honestly, I don't see her coming
back to the same pool hall.

14:13.674 --> 14:14.674
It's a big city.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.726
You wanna bet?

14:16.728 --> 14:19.262
It is a big city. It's intimidating.

14:19.264 --> 14:22.499
When I first got to town, I hardly
left the corner of 63rd and Lex.

14:22.501 --> 14:26.536
For three months I ate the same
pizza, drank the same cup of coffee.

14:26.538 --> 14:28.171
(LAUGHING) What?

14:28.173 --> 14:30.840
Nothing. Just tough to imagine
you being scared of anything.

14:41.418 --> 14:42.651
Buy me a beer?

14:43.821 --> 14:45.688
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

14:45.690 --> 14:48.790
Uh, two, um, drafts, please.

14:48.792 --> 14:50.426
Got ID, kid?

14:50.428 --> 14:52.461
Uh... how 'bout two drafts for me?

14:55.532 --> 14:57.899
I'm guessing you didn't have too
hard a time fending for yourself.

14:59.769 --> 15:01.237
To the kindness of strangers.

15:05.474 --> 15:06.608
Is that our girl?

15:08.878 --> 15:10.245
I'm glad we didn't bet.

15:13.415 --> 15:16.584
Hi! I'm Cara, I just wanna talk.

15:16.586 --> 15:19.487
- Who the hell are you?
- I just wanna help.

15:19.489 --> 15:21.088
What makes you think I need your help?

15:21.090 --> 15:23.824
Because there are others like
you. Like us. From all over.

15:23.826 --> 15:26.227
Listen to me, Piper, you're
in danger unless you trust us.

15:29.665 --> 15:31.599
Damn it, it's too late. They're here.

15:33.536 --> 15:35.570
- Piper, you need to do exactly as we...
- (WHOOSHING)

15:36.638 --> 15:38.305
Twice? Seriously?

15:38.307 --> 15:41.776
- Come on, we gotta jump.
- No. No, we can't. Too crowded.

15:41.778 --> 15:42.910
Just keep walking.

16:04.165 --> 16:05.666
That was, um...

16:06.734 --> 16:07.867

16:08.869 --> 16:10.270

- Johnny, what's up?

you're satisfied by Kyle

You just assaulted a peace officer.

Just so you know, I'm not
gonna make a habit of, uh,

19:07.700 --> 19:10.834
kissing you every time Ultra shows up.

19:10.836 --> 19:12.836
That's good to know.

19:12.838 --> 19:15.006
So, you getting any hits on your radar?

19:15.008 --> 19:17.875
No. Piper's not underground,
we gotta hit the streets.

19:17.877 --> 19:19.743
That could take all night.

You got something else to do?

19:24.749 --> 19:29.052
Wait, so, I'm sorry, I'm losing
track, which one was Crystal?

19:29.054 --> 19:33.757
- The one with the big hands?
- No, no, that was Cheyenne.

19:33.759 --> 19:36.126
Seventh grade and actually a total babe.

19:36.128 --> 19:39.896
Until she tried to steal my
guinea pig and I had to dump her.

19:39.898 --> 19:41.964
Crystal was ninth grade band camp.

19:41.966 --> 19:43.872
First time I tried to
kiss her, she was, uh,

19:43.873 --> 19:45.741
soaking a reed in her mouth

19:45.837 --> 19:47.270
and I almost choked on it.

19:48.672 --> 19:51.141
So, what you're saying is
that you only date girls

19:51.143 --> 19:53.108
with stripper names and who start with "C?"

19:53.110 --> 19:54.877
Well, then I guess you're in luck.

19:54.879 --> 19:56.779
Cara.

19:56.781 --> 19:59.549
- Cara's not a stripper name.
- Okay.

19:59.551 --> 20:02.752
- Is it?
- No. No.

20:02.754 --> 20:03.753
It's pretty...

20:05.255 --> 20:06.255
stripper-y.

20:13.763 --> 20:16.371
You've only been with one
guy, really? Just John?

20:16.372 --> 20:18.005
What did you expect?

20:18.335 --> 20:21.937
I don't know, I mean, at least
one or two other conquests.

20:21.939 --> 20:25.040
I was 17 and I just wanted
to lose it when I left home.

20:25.042 --> 20:28.276
- And he just swooped in and scooped you up...
- Okay. All right, Romeo.

20:28.278 --> 20:30.979
- What about you?
- More than one.

20:30.981 --> 20:34.049
- But no Tomorrow People.
- So?

20:34.051 --> 20:36.350
So, you're a televirgin?

20:36.352 --> 20:39.287
Um... (CHUCKLING) okay,
what does that mean?

20:39.289 --> 20:41.723
Is there, like, a separate category?

20:41.725 --> 20:43.191
Think about it.

20:43.193 --> 20:46.260
Being able to read someone's
mind, feel what they're feeling?

20:46.262 --> 20:48.629
Emotionally. Physically.

20:49.764 --> 20:52.166
It leads to a deeper...

I don't know how else to put it...

20:57.207 --> 20:58.306
intimacy.

I'm getting something.

22:19.852 --> 22:21.153
What now?

22:21.155 --> 22:22.753
Ready to trust us?

22:22.755 --> 22:23.954
Good, let's go.

22:40.966 --> 22:44.436
Every kid *** was completely uber-normal.

22:44.438 --> 22:47.571
You were either a cheerleader
or in the school play,

22:47.573 --> 22:49.373
or in the debate club.

22:49.375 --> 22:50.808
Except me.

22:50.810 --> 22:54.078
I was always in that zero
percentile of success.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.181
We know what it's like
to feel alone, Piper.

22:57.183 --> 22:58.449
Treated like freaks.

22:58.451 --> 22:59.516
What brought you to New York?

22:59.518 --> 23:01.185
I don't know, it's weird.

23:02.387 --> 23:05.021
It was like I was just drawn here.

23:05.023 --> 23:06.990
It's not weird at all.

23:06.992 --> 23:07.796
There's something about our powers

23:10.062 --> 23:11.595
But why here?

23:11.597 --> 23:13.631
That's what we're trying to figure out.

23:13.633 --> 23:15.132
In the meantime, you'll be safe here.

23:15.134 --> 23:17.200
Tim says there's something that can't wait.

23:17.202 --> 23:19.136
Who's Tim? Is he your leader?

23:19.138 --> 23:20.436
He thinks he is.

23:23.340 --> 23:26.109
I just feel bad for my parents.

23:26.111 --> 23:27.310
I'm sure they miss you.

23:27.312 --> 23:29.146
It's not just me.

23:29.148 --> 23:30.613
My sister.

23:30.615 --> 23:32.682
Bolted when she was 17.

23:32.684 --> 23:34.517
Part of what brought me here was...

23:34.519 --> 23:36.319
I felt she was here too.

23:36.321 --> 23:38.621
That if I just wandered
around, I'd bump into her.

23:38.623 --> 23:42.024
Gotta admit... it does sound kinda crazy.

23:42.026 --> 23:42.992
- No.
- CARA: Stephen.

23:44.094 --> 23:46.195
Can I borrow you for a moment?

23:46.197 --> 23:47.297
Yeah.

23:48.332 --> 23:50.032
We have a problem.

23:50.034 --> 23:52.134
Do you have any idea who Piper is?

23:54.271 --> 23:55.971
JOHN: Excuse me.

23:55.973 --> 23:57.639
Sir.

23:57.641 --> 24:00.676
- A little help?
- Can we just teleport our asses out of her, already?

24:00.678 --> 24:02.912
You know we can't just
disappear in front of these cops.

24:02.914 --> 24:04.246
They have

24:04.248 --> 24:07.116
alien abductions around
these parts all the time.

24:07.118 --> 24:09.118
Sir, please.

24:10.553 --> 24:12.387
Just keep your mouth shut.

24:13.790 --> 24:14.823
What?

24:16.192 --> 24:19.227
I know we made some bad choices last night,

24:19.229 --> 24:21.863
but my buddy here, his
dad just passed away.

24:21.865 --> 24:23.865
We're not troublemakers.

24:23.867 --> 24:26.367
We're just two guys
trying to get to a funeral.

24:26.369 --> 24:28.669
Who conveniently don't
have a single piece of ID.

24:31.207 --> 24:32.773
His name was Chan-Woo Kwon,

24:33.876 --> 24:35.276
of Portland, Oregon.

24:39.215 --> 24:41.615
That was a beautiful story.

24:41.617 --> 24:42.783
You can forget about the funeral.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.084
Screw you, man.

24:44.086 --> 24:45.252
What is your problem?

24:45.254 --> 24:46.286
You.

24:47.422 --> 24:49.523
Did I wanna risk crossing the damn country

24:49.525 --> 24:51.158
when Ultra's been all over us?

24:51.160 --> 24:54.628
Last time I checked, I don't
even have a family to go home to.

24:54.630 --> 24:56.296
I'm here for you, man.

24:57.866 --> 24:59.766
You wanna know what I think?

24:59.768 --> 25:01.501
I'm too hungover to mind-read.

25:01.503 --> 25:03.770
I think we're stuck in here
'cause you want to be in here.

25:03.772 --> 25:05.172

your good job.

25:35.136 --> 25:37.336

And I'm supposed to thank you?

For spending my life in
this house, practicing,

praying you'll finally
tell me I'm good enough.

27:33.312 --> 27:35.646
They're sisters.

27:35.648 --> 27:37.782
This is a mistake. We never
should have brought Piper in.

27:37.784 --> 27:39.217
She needs to be protected.

27:39.219 --> 27:40.785
Being Darcy's sister doesn't change that.

27:40.787 --> 27:42.620
We don't know a thing about this girl.

27:42.622 --> 27:44.088
For all we know, she's working for Darcy.

27:44.090 --> 27:45.556
No, you would have picked up on it.

27:45.558 --> 27:47.725
Okay, Piper is just a scared runaway.

27:47.727 --> 27:48.926
What do you recommend?

27:50.829 --> 27:52.830
Oh, no. No.

27:52.832 --> 27:54.265
You've lost your mind.

27:54.267 --> 27:55.933
They deserve a chance to be reunited.

27:55.935 --> 27:58.269
Okay? Just at least think it through.

27:58.271 --> 27:58.776
I just did.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.598
And I came up with about 100
reasons why it's a terrible idea.

28:01.607 --> 28:04.742
Darcy may be Ultra, but
she also left family behind.

28:04.744 --> 28:06.777
If it were my brother,

28:06.779 --> 28:09.880
or your sister, wouldn't
you want to see her?

28:09.882 --> 28:11.215
Wait...

28:11.217 --> 28:12.916
she's here?

28:12.918 --> 28:14.251
My sister?

28:18.422 --> 28:19.989
Do you know where to find her?

28:19.991 --> 28:24.761
Piper, your sister works for
a secret government program.

28:24.763 --> 28:26.696
The people that were after you.

28:26.698 --> 28:28.298
STEPHEN: She was captured

28:28.300 --> 28:31.401
and put into service along
with countless others like us.

28:31.403 --> 28:34.436
- Why?
- Because her boss is a demented eugenicist

28:34.438 --> 28:36.873
who's goal is to wipe us
off the face of the Earth.

28:36.875 --> 28:38.907
Understand the risks, Piper.

28:38.909 --> 28:40.708
This could end very badly.

28:46.315 --> 28:47.515
I need to see her.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.788
I hope you know Darcy as
well as you think you do.

29:05.529 --> 29:07.632
- DARCY: Where is she?
- She's safe.

29:11.202 --> 29:12.303
Does she want to see me?

29:14.339 --> 29:17.441
Yes. And you can.

29:17.443 --> 29:18.676
Under one condition.

29:19.844 --> 29:22.179
Our employer cannot know about it.

29:23.648 --> 29:25.548
I am a senior field agent.

29:27.185 --> 29:29.119
Think about what you are asking me to do.

29:29.121 --> 29:31.121
She is all alone.

29:31.123 --> 29:33.657
And I know you remember what that was like.

29:33.659 --> 29:36.160
I could report you right now.

29:36.162 --> 29:39.196
For not turning in a breakout
through the proper channels.

29:39.198 --> 29:42.231
But you're not going to, are you, Darcy?

29:45.336 --> 29:47.069
When can I see her?

29:51.676 --> 29:54.377
Next time you two want to raise hell,

29:54.379 --> 29:55.779
bring driver's licenses.

29:58.648 --> 29:59.715
Story checked out.

30:02.152 --> 30:03.319
You're free to go.

30:05.856 --> 30:07.290
Sorry for your loss.

30:17.534 --> 30:19.768
So, keep going...

30:21.137 --> 30:22.170
or go home?

30:23.840 --> 30:25.874
You were right.

30:25.876 --> 30:27.409
I am scared.

30:28.578 --> 30:30.111
I'm scared so...

30:33.850 --> 30:35.250
Your dad's gone.

30:35.252 --> 30:36.384
Your debt's paid.

30:37.386 --> 30:39.721
Nothing to be scared of anymore.

30:39.723 --> 30:41.456
I'm scared to see my Mom.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.528
I was a coward, I left in shame.

30:48.831 --> 30:50.531
How am I going to look her in the eye?

30:53.235 --> 30:54.769
Let her see the man you've become.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.447
What if she doesn't show?

31:08.583 --> 31:10.550
She'll show.

31:10.552 --> 31:12.519
Probably doesn't even remember me.

31:15.590 --> 31:17.424
How could I forget my baby sister?

31:21.696 --> 31:23.430
Ah, look at you.

31:25.099 --> 31:26.332
You look beautiful.

31:34.174 --> 31:37.576
So, what, you're like
a secret agent lady now?

31:37.578 --> 31:38.778
And you're a pool hustler?

31:38.780 --> 31:40.513
Hey. It pays the bills.

31:42.482 --> 31:43.849
How are Mom and Dad?

31:45.619 --> 31:47.686
Alive.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.188
But they never got over you.

31:50.757 --> 31:53.459
Piper, I am so sorry.

31:55.629 --> 31:57.496
I never stopped thinking about you.

32:03.437 --> 32:05.137
<i>(THINKING) Stephen, it's me.</i>

32:05.139 --> 32:07.640
<i>(THINKING) What's going on?
I'm with Piper and Darcy.</i>

32:07.642 --> 32:10.242
<i>CARA: Yeah, so is Ultra.</i>

32:10.244 --> 32:11.376
What?

32:11.378 --> 32:13.211
What have you done?

32:13.213 --> 32:15.047
It's the right thing.

32:15.049 --> 32:16.581
How could you do this to her?

32:16.583 --> 32:18.883
It's okay, Piper, I'm gonna to
be with you every step of the way.

32:18.885 --> 32:20.552
For what? What are you talking about?

32:20.554 --> 32:21.686
She's going to take your powers.

32:21.688 --> 32:23.388
It's the only way to keep you safe.

32:23.390 --> 32:24.622
It's not the only way.

32:25.758 --> 32:27.158
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

32:27.160 --> 32:28.693
<i>Get out through the alley.</i>

32:28.695 --> 32:30.328
You know what taking away
someone's powers does to them.

32:30.330 --> 32:32.396
You have seen it in their eyes.

32:32.398 --> 32:33.832
They are shells of who they were.

32:33.834 --> 32:36.133
She is your family,

32:36.135 --> 32:37.702
your species.

32:39.572 --> 32:41.172
Don't do this, Darcy.

32:42.540 --> 32:43.807
CARA: Ten seconds, move.

32:45.477 --> 32:46.777
We gotta go.

32:46.779 --> 32:48.245
I'm not leaving.

32:49.581 --> 32:50.581
Darcy.

32:54.219 --> 32:55.652
He's right.

32:55.654 --> 32:57.254
Let's get out of here.

33:17.741 --> 33:19.409
All clear inside?

33:21.345 --> 33:22.479
Where's the breakout?

33:22.481 --> 33:23.846
I lost her.

33:23.848 --> 33:26.249
Probably wouldn't have if
you had gotten here in time.

33:26.251 --> 33:29.419
One of our telepaths detected a
signature here not one minute ago.

33:29.421 --> 33:31.554
A few signatures actually.

33:31.556 --> 33:32.822
Are you calling me a liar?

33:32.824 --> 33:34.690
It doesn't matter what I think.

33:34.692 --> 33:36.392
You know protocol.

33:36.394 --> 33:37.827
They'll scan your brain back at HQ,

33:37.829 --> 33:39.395
find out everything you know.

33:43.099 --> 33:44.667
- (CLANGING)
- What was that?

33:44.669 --> 33:46.135
We gotta go.

33:47.737 --> 33:49.071
Piper, run!

33:50.573 --> 33:52.774
Tell your men to stand down.

33:52.776 --> 33:55.135
Or what? Your kind can't kill.

33:55.136 --> 33:57.345
I don't need to kill in order to stop you.

33:57.832 --> 33:59.266
Put down the gun.

34:01.336 --> 34:02.769
I said put down the damn gun.

34:07.174 --> 34:08.507
Take her out.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.309
(GUNFIRE)

34:20.820 --> 34:22.721
We have to go.

34:22.723 --> 34:23.722
Now.

34:36.411 --> 34:39.179
Piper, I am so sorry.

34:39.181 --> 34:40.849
She was all I had left.

34:42.217 --> 34:43.818
I can't go home again.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.221
I have no one.

34:46.223 --> 34:47.321
You have us.

34:48.889 --> 34:51.259
Before you know it, this
place will feel like home.

34:53.061 --> 34:54.228
Irene!

34:58.800 --> 34:59.800
Oh.

35:02.203 --> 35:05.038
(GROANS) I'm going to give
you a legit one of these,

35:05.040 --> 35:06.439
when I'm healed.

35:06.441 --> 35:07.841
Thank you.

35:07.843 --> 35:09.810
All I did was take you to the hospital.

35:09.812 --> 35:11.912
We don't go to hospitals.

35:11.914 --> 35:14.248
You took a chance and saved my life.

35:14.250 --> 35:16.316
Anyways, gonna go pass out.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.800
You ready for this?

35:33.802 --> 35:34.934
Not really.

35:37.204 --> 35:38.938
What am I even supposed to say?

35:43.076 --> 35:44.944
Maybe just being here is enough.

35:48.982 --> 35:50.183
C'mon.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.671

36:22.072 --> 36:23.565

37:10.127 --> 37:12.028
(APPLAUSE)

37:46.830 --> 37:49.097
Someone has been a very, very bad girl.

37:51.767 --> 37:53.368
I just ran out to the bakery.

37:53.370 --> 37:56.038
Don't lie, it's unbecoming.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.807
You used your powers again.

38:01.377 --> 38:03.812
Okay, so I teleported.

38:05.047 --> 38:07.916
The bakery I like is
three train steps away.

38:08.951 --> 38:10.785
I thought we had an arrangement?

38:10.787 --> 38:12.386
So this little thing of ours can work.

38:13.722 --> 38:17.224
You know, I could strip
you of your powers, Morgan.

38:17.226 --> 38:19.293
Throw you into a windowless cell.

38:19.295 --> 38:22.029
I'd put a bullet through you
and no one would blink an eye.

38:24.166 --> 38:25.732
Well, what's stopping you.

38:27.302 --> 38:29.736
Keep flouting the rules and
you'll see how serious I am.

38:32.107 --> 38:33.674
Maybe I like to flout the rules.

38:36.744 --> 38:38.445
Morgan.

38:38.447 --> 38:40.280
Maybe you like it too.

(BUTTONS CLATTERING)

38:54.395 --> 38:55.862
There you are.

38:55.864 --> 38:58.198
Yep, just been hiding.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.266
Sorry, I wasn't ready to go home.

39:01.835 --> 39:03.236
I know.

39:03.238 --> 39:04.937
I know you can hear my thoughts.

39:07.841 --> 39:09.409
You can't blame yourself.

39:09.411 --> 39:11.410
Who else is there to blame?

39:11.412 --> 39:13.178
In the end, you were right about Darcy.

39:14.214 --> 39:15.748
I misjudged her.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.082
Doesn't matter.

39:17.084 --> 39:19.385
She's still gone.

39:19.387 --> 39:22.321
I never should have forced you to
go after Piper in the first place.

39:22.323 --> 39:24.924
You told me to think for myself.

39:24.926 --> 39:27.192
I did and I'm glad.

39:27.194 --> 39:30.729
You tried to reunite two
lost, lonely siblings.

39:30.787 --> 39:33.388
And you risked getting
caught to stay with Piper.

39:33.390 --> 39:36.424
It reminded of what I've known all along.

39:36.426 --> 39:38.460
You're the best person I've ever met.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.334
I don't know if I belong here, Cara.

39:47.336 --> 39:49.103
Why would you say that?

39:49.105 --> 39:50.905
It's like John always says,

39:51.974 --> 39:53.207
we're at war.

39:53.209 --> 39:55.509
And in war there's no room for...

39:55.511 --> 39:57.778
for whatever, sentimentality.

39:57.780 --> 39:59.947
You mean humanity?

39:59.949 --> 40:01.482
John keeps people alive.

40:01.484 --> 40:03.317
You kept Irene alive.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.920
Before we brought you in,

40:06.922 --> 40:09.490
we'd lost sight of what it is to be alive.

40:11.092 --> 40:12.226
At least I know I had.

40:14.095 --> 40:15.429
You've given us a gift.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.235
So are we going to talk
about... about last night?

40:24.271 --> 40:25.972
What about it?

40:27.842 --> 40:30.110
We, um...

40:30.112 --> 40:32.112
(CLEARS THROAT) made out.

40:32.114 --> 40:34.514
Right, I'm sorry.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.782
I forgot.

40:36.784 --> 40:38.050
No, you didn't.

40:38.052 --> 40:39.485
Well I'm glad it was memorable.

40:39.487 --> 40:41.554
I worried I didn't stack up against

40:41.556 --> 40:43.889
Crystal and Cheyenne.

40:45.091 --> 40:47.260
Well, you were...

40:49.429 --> 40:51.130
um...

40:51.132 --> 40:53.298
you were pretty

40:53.300 --> 40:54.366
amazing.

40:58.204 --> 41:01.040
I think about you, Cara.

41:05.311 --> 41:06.911
I think about you too.

41:19.325 --> 41:20.758
I'm sorry.

41:24.096 --> 41:27.498
I just thought we should
go someplace more private.
