02:00.497 --> 02:02.574
What do you mean, you think?

02:02.891 --> 02:04.406
I mean I’m late.

02:05.518 --> 02:07.718
Like, late.

02:08.945 --> 02:10.428
Did you take a test?

02:12.318 --> 02:13.197
Okay.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.573
Okay, um.

02:16.957 --> 02:21.299
Look, we have to know, okay?

02:21.360 --> 02:25.006
Maybe it’s a false alarm, you know?

02:25.695 --> 02:28.651
Come on. Drug Store’s still open.

02:30.152 --> 02:32.351
We’ll do it together. Okay?

02:39.490 --> 02:40.452
Marry me.

02:47.313 --> 02:48.799
I don’t know what to say.

02:49.105 --> 02:50.621
Well, yes would be a good start.

02:53.587 --> 02:55.725
It just seems so out of the blue.

02:55.802 --> 02:57.124
After 15 years?

02:57.593 --> 03:00.093
Look, Karen, when you left for Italy we had a future.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.947
We’re still the same two people who stood at that airport.

03:05.674 --> 03:07.885
I was the man who was in love with you.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.164
And I still am.

03:11.051 --> 03:12.447
I love you too, Keith.

03:13.358 --> 03:14.777
You’re my best friend.

03:15.489 --> 03:18.029
You’ve been a wonderful father figure for Lucas.

03:20.117 --> 03:25.221
But the time away, the distance, it gave me a new perspective.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.778
- On us?
- On everything.

03:28.330 --> 03:30.971
Tree Hill is such a small part of the world.

03:31.530 --> 03:35.405
And maybe it’s where I belong, but there’s so much more out there.

03:35.846 --> 03:40.597
Italy was the first time since Lucas was born that I’ve spent any time alone.

03:41.586 --> 03:44.704
I realized I only know my self as Lucas’ mother.

03:45.679 --> 03:47.898
I’ve got to find the rest of me.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.502
You mean the world to me, Keith.

03:56.378 --> 03:57.677
But I’m sorry.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.160
I can’t marry you.

04:15.779 --> 04:16.873
It’s positive.

04:19.868 --> 04:20.902
Oh my God.

04:28.429 --> 04:29.760
I’m pregnant.

04:38.199 --> 04:39.063
Come on.

04:42.525 --> 04:46.390
I know you’re still mad at me. Okay? But I’m here for you.

04:47.086 --> 04:50.297
Alright, we’ll go to the doctor tomorrow. In the city. I’ll take you.

04:50.392 --> 04:52.457
- I’ll take myself.
- Brooke.

04:53.211 --> 04:57.245
I’m just as scared as you are. But I want to help.

04:58.852 --> 05:02.831
Please. Just, trust me.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.691
Yeah cause that worked out so well for me the last time.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.347
Hey you, wake up.

05:31.726 --> 05:33.291
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:33.818 --> 05:35.543
I didn’t even hear you come in.

05:35.925 --> 05:37.831
Well you didn’t hear your alarm clock either.

05:38.184 --> 05:43.094
That’s cause it didn’t go off. Everybody gets up at six. Geez.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.774
Well, time to get up.

05:46.146 --> 05:46.920
I am up.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.684
- Come here.
- Oh yeah?

05:57.615 --> 05:58.731
Oh, I’ll get that.

06:04.065 --> 06:06.995
You want me to start your shower?

06:07.236 --> 06:12.423
- Uh, yeah. Thanks.
- Okay.

06:18.227 --> 06:19.113
So, what happened?

06:19.978 --> 06:22.805
The nurse said they’d call me in a few hours with the results,

06:22.892 --> 06:25.017
and then she asked me about the father.

06:25.910 --> 06:26.943
What did you say?

06:27.223 --> 06:30.158
I told her the sorry bro hoe kicked my ass to the curb.

06:33.380 --> 06:34.069
God.

06:51.048 --> 06:54.442
So this whole thing with Haley really was just your way of messing with me, huh?

06:55.271 --> 06:56.700
What’s your problem now?

06:57.666 --> 06:59.925
I saw you making out with Peyton last night.

07:02.178 --> 07:06.408
Look, maybe you’re a little slow, but we kissed because it was the auction rules.

07:06.464 --> 07:07.447
I know what I saw.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.588
I’m about to beat your ass, man.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.726
I promised Haley I’d give you a break, that’s about the only thing that’s saving you right now.

07:15.901 --> 07:18.736
Look, I kissed Peyton like you kissed Haley. That’s it.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.694
What are you so tweaked about?

07:25.711 --> 07:28.082
Never mind. Sorry.

07:38.203 --> 07:39.217
What do you want, Nikki?

07:39.411 --> 07:40.737
I think we covered that.

07:43.937 --> 07:44.773
Let me hold her.

07:44.916 --> 07:50.406
No, no she’s tired. Peyton, could you take Jenny to her room for me, please?

07:50.503 --> 07:51.388
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

07:52.760 --> 07:53.768
Is that your girlfriend?

07:54.510 --> 07:57.670
She’s just a friend, okay? She sits for Jenny sometimes.

07:57.741 --> 07:59.780
- Relax, I’m just asking.
- Nikki...

07:59.994 --> 08:04.096
Listen, our little romantic outing to the grocery store got me thinking.

08:04.653 --> 08:08.744
You shouldn’t have to be using food stamps and paying for everything. I can help you.

08:09.246 --> 08:11.668
- I have some tuition money left over...
- I don’t want your money.

08:12.681 --> 08:14.218
Jake, this isn’t fair.

08:14.669 --> 08:17.904
Now you won’t let me be a part of my daughter’s life but you’ll hand her off to some babysitter?

08:17.970 --> 08:21.473
Hey, Jenny loves Peyton. She’s got a lot of other people that care about her too.

08:21.524 --> 08:23.055
And none of those people are her mother.

08:27.811 --> 08:28.755
What are you looking at?

08:29.521 --> 08:30.525
You’re life.

08:31.667 --> 08:35.173
Yeah, that’s my life. You notice who’s not in it?

08:40.932 --> 08:43.408
Brooke, hold on. Still no news?

08:43.509 --> 08:44.605
Did I come find you?

08:45.317 --> 08:46.198
Well where are you going?

08:46.946 --> 08:48.405
Away from you.

08:48.497 --> 08:51.256
Hey, come on, you can’t cut me out of this. I’m just as worried as you are.

08:51.339 --> 08:54.554
Oh really? Or are you just worried that having a kid might deflate your market value?

08:54.989 --> 08:56.131
That’s not it.

08:56.295 --> 08:59.158
Oh that’s right, you’re not on the market anymore. You’re a one woman kind of guy.

08:59.275 --> 09:01.374
Speaking of which, how is my former best friend?

09:01.439 --> 09:02.823
Peyton has nothing to do with this, okay?

09:02.900 --> 09:06.344
Not yet. Maybe you can pull a Dan Scott and knock her up too.

09:06.396 --> 09:07.087
Brooke!

09:08.000 --> 09:11.322
Or maybe then you can move on to random bar-sluts. Oh wait you’ve already done that.

09:11.383 --> 09:14.456
Better be careful, Danny Jr., never know how many kids you’re going to end up with.

09:14.527 --> 09:15.679
Oh yeah, that’s real nice, Brooke.

09:15.771 --> 09:18.403
And by the way, it’s not like I’m the only guy you’ve ever slept with.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.417
What’s your point?

09:19.530 --> 09:20.918
How do I even know it’s mine?

09:24.997 --> 09:27.429
It’s the doctor. Hello?

09:27.916 --> 09:29.165
Yeah, this is Brooke.

09:34.131 --> 09:37.075
Okay. Thank you.

09:39.051 --> 09:41.816
Trust me, it’s yours.

09:58.288 --> 10:01.262
Oh, that reminds me.

10:03.639 --> 10:04.612
How did you get in here?

10:05.179 --> 10:06.152
Door was open.

10:06.818 --> 10:09.936
Why? Who were you expecting? Another high school boy with his pants around his ankles?

10:12.855 --> 10:13.787
What do you want, Dan?

10:13.853 --> 10:16.670
I want my son to come to his senses. Have you seen his apartment?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.348
Yeah, I dropped off some food.

10:18.609 --> 10:19.736
Did he ask you for any money?

10:19.839 --> 10:22.189
No, but I gave him some.

10:22.264 --> 10:25.761
Oh, that’s great. That’s great. Don’t you ever want him to come home?

10:25.829 --> 10:27.796
I want him home as much as you do.

10:27.873 --> 10:30.595
But for once in his life you need to let him make his own mistakes.

10:30.662 --> 10:33.559
Right, you bring him food and cash and I’m the one who needs to let him make his own mistakes.

10:33.617 --> 10:37.692
Oh and by the way, you can tell your friend Karen, her son was coming out of a family planning clinic.

10:37.744 --> 10:40.989
With a date. Is that the kind of mistake you had in mind for Nathan

10:49.109 --> 10:49.780
You hungry?

10:49.914 --> 10:51.357
Oh, I’m hungry for you.

10:51.634 --> 10:56.307
No I’m serious. We can heat something up, or go out and eat if you want to.

10:56.954 --> 10:57.773
What’s wrong?

10:58.480 --> 10:59.626
Nothing, I’m just hungry.

11:00.813 --> 11:02.258
I don’t buy it. Talk to me.

11:02.473 --> 11:04.772
I just don’t feel like making out, that’s all.

11:04.844 --> 11:07.507
You realize you just said that, right? Since when?

11:09.165 --> 11:11.510
Since you got my jersey number tattooed on your ass.

11:12.611 --> 11:16.844
Oh. Above my ass, actually.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.933
When did you see that?

11:19.230 --> 11:20.045
This morning.

11:22.959 --> 11:24.125
Does that bother you?

11:24.428 --> 11:25.856
I’m just confused as hell.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.780
I mean you’ll do something that permanent, but you won’t have sex with me?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.796
You can get a tattoo removed, Nathan.

11:32.349 --> 11:35.615
- Sex is a really big deal for me.
- I get that.

11:35.733 --> 11:38.845
- That’s why I haven’t been pressuring you into it.
- The way you’re not pressuring me right now.

11:43.074 --> 11:44.324
I’m going to heat up some food.

11:51.881 --> 11:53.264
- Brooke.
- I’m busy.

11:53.684 --> 11:56.838
Look, don’t shut me out on this, okay? We can deal with it together.

11:56.903 --> 12:00.400
We’re not together, remember? You dodged the bullet just in time.

12:06.426 --> 12:10.599
Hey. Nathan told me about the fantasy kiss scenario you thought you saw.

12:10.676 --> 12:11.476
Were you high?

12:12.508 --> 12:15.136
The kiss didn’t mean anything, I wouldn’t do that to Haley.

12:15.429 --> 12:18.587
Yeah, I guess I overreacted.

12:21.839 --> 12:23.620
- She’s gone, you know.
- Huh?

12:23.764 --> 12:25.049
- Brooke.
- What?

12:25.141 --> 12:26.553
Why do you assume I’m looking for Brooke?

12:26.743 --> 12:30.154
Because you are. She still freezing you out?

12:30.317 --> 12:32.259
- Yeah, sort of.
- Me too.

12:32.929 --> 12:34.101
Do you want to talk about it?

12:34.663 --> 12:37.132
I think I’ve screwed things up enough as it is.

12:37.199 --> 12:39.939
- Yeah, me too.
- And worse than that.

12:40.475 --> 12:43.845
What? Worse than the death wish best friend love triangle?

12:44.060 --> 12:45.826
What’d you do? Tell her she was fat?

12:47.275 --> 12:49.922
Okay look she’s pissed at me too but she’s still my friend.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.151
What’s going on?

12:52.441 --> 12:54.121
What were we thinking, Peyton?

12:54.551 --> 12:57.127
You and me, or you and Brooke?

12:57.536 --> 12:58.411
All of us.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.449
I guess we weren’t.

13:19.009 --> 13:21.421
I like that. What color is it?

13:21.655 --> 13:22.384
Shag.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.524
Did Nathan ever cheat on you?

13:28.973 --> 13:30.294
Where’d that come from?

13:31.680 --> 13:37.189
I just wonder if, maybe he’s going to start looking somewhere else for what he’s not getting from me.

13:37.299 --> 13:39.791
Hm, the big bad sex issue.

13:41.661 --> 13:42.250
Yeah.

13:43.734 --> 13:47.885
I mean, we start making out, and it’s great,

13:47.964 --> 13:52.986
and I totally get into him, and then I just hit this point.

13:53.062 --> 13:54.179
I bet he loves that.

13:54.952 --> 14:00.067
Yeah. I guess I just always thought I would wait until I fell in love,

14:00.133 --> 14:05.781
and got married, and then I met Nathan and everything got really confusing.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.364
It was never something I had to deal with right away, it was always a few years off.

14:09.441 --> 14:11.229
- And then all of a sudden…
- It wasn’t?

14:12.513 --> 14:13.834
I’ve been down that road.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.262
I don’t know if I’m ready, Peyton.

14:16.462 --> 14:18.962
Or maybe you’re just not sure if Nathan’s the right guy.

14:19.262 --> 14:22.646
No, I’m... I can safely rule that out. He...

14:23.707 --> 14:27.484
I can’t breath when I’m around him and when I’m not around him I want to be.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.601
I’m just, I’m totally in love with him.

14:30.448 --> 14:33.772
Well then you’ve gone further with him than I ever did.

14:48.830 --> 14:49.911
Be careful with those knees.

14:50.858 --> 14:51.985
Trust me, I know.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.463
I also know what it’s like to be sidelined with an injury.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.862
I wouldn’t wish it on anyone who’s serious about their game.

15:02.598 --> 15:03.530
How’s the shoulder?

15:05.466 --> 15:06.412
Fine.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.005
Good.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.787
You know, I saw you at the clinic the other day with that girl.

15:15.183 --> 15:18.900
I don’t have to tell you, you’re turning into my area of expertise.

15:20.031 --> 15:24.036
You know, Lucas, one day I woke up and I was looking down the barrel of a life I couldn’t control.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.085
Maybe you find yourself in the same situation.

15:29.657 --> 15:31.387
I just thought you could use some advice.

15:34.070 --> 15:35.800
I can see that you’re scared.

15:37.118 --> 15:39.033
But don’t let that fear cloud your vision.

15:39.932 --> 15:41.587
You know I asked your mom to get an abortion.

15:42.124 --> 15:44.158
She said no. She was too emotional.

15:45.011 --> 15:48.771
If she was thinking clearly, she would have done what I said.

15:50.537 --> 15:52.713
So your advice is to have an abortion.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.716
The way you would have aborted me.

15:59.197 --> 16:02.201
You’ve got a lot of life yet to live, Lucas.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.892
Don’t let this girl make the same mistake your mother made.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.524
Cause if you do, you’ll be paying for it until the day you die.

16:19.719 --> 16:21.231
I’m glad you came by, Keith.

16:21.308 --> 16:24.871
I’ve been so caught up in my own problems, we haven’t had a chance to catch up.

16:28.077 --> 16:29.904
Well you might as well hear it here.

16:30.959 --> 16:32.316
I asked Karen to marry me.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.297
What?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.315
She said no.

16:39.434 --> 16:43.703
Oh, Keith I’m so sorry.

16:44.058 --> 16:46.576
You know, you never picture it.

16:47.323 --> 16:51.112
You run it through your mind a thousand times over fifteen years.

16:52.367 --> 16:55.802
You know how the moment will feel when your love agrees to be your wife.

16:56.810 --> 16:58.675
But you never see her saying no.

17:00.992 --> 17:03.928
Well, you’re still an important part of her life.

17:04.354 --> 17:06.847
That won’t change. She needs you.

17:07.204 --> 17:08.459
Well maybe she needs me.

17:09.479 --> 17:10.794
But she doesn’t want me.

17:12.228 --> 17:13.266
I’m sorry.

17:15.028 --> 17:16.205
What did Lucas say?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.478
I don’t even know if she’s told him yet.

17:33.508 --> 17:34.817
Dad.

17:35.748 --> 17:38.181
Ohh. Looks like I missed the party.

17:38.677 --> 17:41.596
You weren’t invited. You should have called.

17:41.684 --> 17:43.485
Why? You don’t call back.

17:43.991 --> 17:47.529
I had to run a credit check to get your address. Your mother wouldn’t give it to me.

17:48.159 --> 17:50.598
Hey. You think you’re ready for this?

17:51.048 --> 17:54.602
I’ve got news for you, son. Playing house costs a lot of money.

17:54.938 --> 17:56.221
Okay, so I‘ll get a job.

17:56.317 --> 17:58.334
Oh great, what’s that going to do to your game?

17:59.389 --> 18:03.004
It’s okay to be irrational every once and a while. But have you thought this thing through?

18:03.300 --> 18:05.062
I give you a week out in the real world.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.925
You know what the best part about having my own place is, dad?

18:08.815 --> 18:11.011
- I can ask you to leave.
- Fine.

18:11.980 --> 18:14.612
But the beach house will be there for you when you hit rock bottom.

18:15.957 --> 18:17.054
And you will.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.645
Who are you calling?

18:26.797 --> 18:27.703
Jake, maybe?

18:29.229 --> 18:34.912
Look, I know you baby-sit Jenny but, I’m back now, so Jake and I won’t be needing you anymore.

18:35.209 --> 18:37.651
Oh, and if there’s anything going on between you and Jake,

18:38.045 --> 18:40.072
well you’re not going to be a permanent part of my daughter’s life,

18:40.154 --> 18:42.879
so if I were you I wouldn’t get too attached.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.694
If I were you, I would walk away.

18:46.628 --> 18:48.726
You have to know you’re temporary, right?

18:49.105 --> 18:51.863
I mean, all the babysitting in the world isn’t going to make you Jenny’s mother.

18:52.771 --> 18:56.555
All the eyeliner in the world wont make you anything other than a psycho stalker bitch.

19:09.247 --> 19:10.139
Friend of yours?

19:11.060 --> 19:12.248
It’s Jake’s ex.

19:12.781 --> 19:16.533
All of a sudden she’s trying to deal with her issues and I think I’m one of them.

19:16.834 --> 19:17.757
Scary.

19:19.522 --> 19:20.863
So you’re talking to me?

19:21.709 --> 19:22.609
Yeah.

19:24.059 --> 19:27.413
There’s some stuff going on and I don’t know what to do.

19:28.426 --> 19:30.858
I screwed up, I can’t even say it.

19:30.930 --> 19:35.298
Is it about Lucas? Cause he was really upset yesterday.

19:35.456 --> 19:37.166
I thought you and Lucas weren’t together.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.512
No, we’re not. We were just, um...

19:39.573 --> 19:43.167
You know what, for get it, Peyton. You are the last person I should be talking to.

19:47.022 --> 19:47.861
Damn.

19:48.426 --> 19:49.972
Yeah, I didn’t want to tell anybody but...

19:50.038 --> 19:53.454
Hey, I didn’t want to tell anybody either but I felt a lot better after I did.

19:54.001 --> 19:55.113
What does Brooke want to do?

19:57.646 --> 20:00.037
I don’t know. She won’t talk to me.

20:00.176 --> 20:01.271
What do you want her to do?

20:01.702 --> 20:02.797
How do I answer that?

20:04.502 --> 20:06.626
I’m just walking around like a zombie right now.

20:08.788 --> 20:10.682
I guess I want whatever’s best for her.

20:10.882 --> 20:12.387
Does she think she’s going to have it?

20:13.514 --> 20:16.755
You know, Nikki and I, we talked about not keeping the baby.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.424
Yeah, so did Dan and my mom.

20:19.663 --> 20:21.455
But how screwed up is that, huh?

20:22.571 --> 20:25.146
If she had listened to him I wouldn’t be standing here right now.

20:28.213 --> 20:34.613
Well, Luke, I don’t want to lie to you. If Brooke has this kid, your life, it’s going to change.

20:35.330 --> 20:36.404
Where’s your head at?

20:36.574 --> 20:39.211
My head says we’re not ready to be parents yet.

20:40.271 --> 20:43.650
I can’t even take care of myself. Plus there’s college.

20:43.728 --> 20:45.811
Not just for me but for Brooke, too.

20:47.332 --> 20:49.451
God, my mom is going to freak out.

20:55.123 --> 20:55.851
Hey.

20:56.051 --> 20:56.753
Hey.

21:00.197 --> 21:01.089
Are you kidding?

21:01.724 --> 21:04.182
I’ve got to sell the car to pay for the apartment.

21:04.243 --> 21:05.538
What is your dad going to say?

21:06.101 --> 21:08.513
He can say whatever he wants, it’s still my car.

21:08.661 --> 21:13.032
You know, if you need some extra money I could always be your sugar mama.

21:19.173 --> 21:20.079
What’s wrong?

21:22.406 --> 21:23.960
Nothing, it’s just I’m...

21:25.101 --> 21:27.371
You said you weren’t ready so I’m trying to respect that.

21:27.437 --> 21:28.741
So we can’t even kiss now?

21:29.044 --> 21:31.579
No, I’m just trying to make you comfortable.

21:35.822 --> 21:39.020
I’m sorry, Nathan, I know this is so not fair to you.

21:39.155 --> 21:42.353
No. Actually it’s not fair to you.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.021
- I just...
- Just, don’t apologize, okay?

22:16.508 --> 22:17.472
Mom?

22:18.321 --> 22:20.625
Hey. Did I wake you?

22:21.094 --> 22:21.936
No.

22:22.171 --> 22:26.068
Sometimes I can’t sleep. I just lie awake and worry.

22:26.801 --> 22:27.922
What are you worried about?

22:28.603 --> 22:31.489
I’m a mother, Lucas. I worry about everything.

22:32.704 --> 22:33.958
What are you doing up?

22:34.695 --> 22:36.475
There’s something I have to tell you.

22:39.677 --> 22:40.794
You should sit.

22:41.782 --> 22:42.554
Okay.

22:47.517 --> 22:49.271
I think I’ll stand.

22:49.820 --> 22:54.137
This is going to hurt you, mom. And I’m sorry.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.381
What happened?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.170
Brooke’s pregnant.

23:02.278 --> 23:03.644
Oh my God, Lucas, I’m sorry.

23:04.023 --> 23:05.267
I guess I deserved that.

23:05.830 --> 23:06.712
Lucas.

23:08.416 --> 23:11.411
Look, I didn’t mean it Lucas.

23:12.030 --> 23:14.728
- I’m pretty sure you did.
- No, I didn’t! It’s just that...

23:15.905 --> 23:20.433
Do you understand? This is exactly what I didn’t want for you.

23:21.042 --> 23:27.053
Have I been talking to my self the last few years? You have so much left to do in life.

23:27.601 --> 23:28.840
So does Brooke.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.971
Oh God, you’re both just too young for this.

23:33.290 --> 23:34.415
Don’t cry, mom.

23:35.532 --> 23:37.814
It’s just that I’m scared for you.

23:40.002 --> 23:42.735
I cannot believe that this is happening.

23:49.530 --> 23:52.720
How close was I to not existing?

23:55.994 --> 23:58.434
Dan wanted to have an abortion, mom.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.685
Why didn’t you listen to him?

24:04.886 --> 24:10.813
Because I realized that I wanted you in my future.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.064
What does Brooke want?

24:19.006 --> 24:20.179
I don’t know.

24:21.812 --> 24:23.485
Oh she must be so scared.

24:26.610 --> 24:27.583
Lucas.

24:30.158 --> 24:31.495
What are we going to do?

24:36.172 --> 24:40.329
Alright, hot off the grill, my friend. I super sized it.

24:40.540 --> 24:41.507
Not hungry.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.635
Alright, more for me.

24:47.493 --> 24:51.420
So, uh, I’ve got to ask you kind of a personal question.

24:52.485 --> 24:53.621
Just out of curiosity.

24:54.455 --> 24:57.579
How many times per minute do guys think about sex?

25:01.400 --> 25:02.648
- Per minute?
- Yeah.

25:02.705 --> 25:06.836
Elle magazine said that guys think about sex like every, 30 seconds.

25:08.812 --> 25:10.240
You’re thinking about having sex with him.

25:10.328 --> 25:11.004
Shh.

25:11.629 --> 25:12.391
Sorry.

25:12.785 --> 25:16.773
Look, it just keeps coming up. And...

25:19.032 --> 25:20.645
Sorry. Wrong words.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.018
Look,

25:24.199 --> 25:26.717
it’s not my place to tell you how to live your life, Hales.

25:27.675 --> 25:29.067
But for what it’s worth,

25:30.414 --> 25:31.996
I wish I would have waited.

25:32.288 --> 25:33.020
Really?

25:33.168 --> 25:37.137
All I’m saying, is just look past the moment.

25:39.456 --> 25:42.672
If you’re not ready, then just wait.

25:44.238 --> 25:45.037
Okay?

25:56.858 --> 25:58.523
I didn’t hear you come in.

25:59.752 --> 26:00.991
I didn’t make any noise.

26:01.766 --> 26:06.910
Your father stopped by, he wanted you address but I wouldn’t give it to him.

26:07.396 --> 26:09.075
- He found me anyway.
- Sorry.

26:11.928 --> 26:17.269
Nathan, you can come home anytime, you know that right?

26:18.293 --> 26:19.694
I’m still here.

26:20.048 --> 26:21.257
I don’t want to come home.

26:24.830 --> 26:30.574
You know, I walk around this empty house and it doesn’t seem real.

26:30.944 --> 26:33.182
I wish I could go back and do things differently.

26:34.031 --> 26:35.608
I need to ask you a question.

26:36.191 --> 26:36.991
Okay.

26:40.067 --> 26:41.328
Why’d you do it?

26:41.864 --> 26:44.006
- What?
- Cheat on dad.

26:46.274 --> 26:48.694
I was confused.

26:49.911 --> 26:54.578
We were married so young and suddenly I was a wife

26:54.645 --> 26:57.163
and a mother before I was my own person.

26:57.255 --> 27:00.235
But when we grew up, we grew apart.

27:00.297 --> 27:03.164
Why, mom? Why did you guys grow apart?

27:03.303 --> 27:04.946
I wish I knew, Nathan.

27:06.218 --> 27:09.503
But none of that makes what I did right.

27:09.570 --> 27:10.649
Cause you were married?

27:10.910 --> 27:17.142
Because I had a commitment to him. And to you.

27:17.444 --> 27:24.407
Those moments of what I mistook for happiness weren’t worth the cost of hurting someone I loved.

27:26.220 --> 27:28.728
And losing you over it now.

27:38.861 --> 27:39.537
Nikki?

27:39.865 --> 27:40.693
Hey, stranger.

27:43.740 --> 27:44.703
How’d you find me?

27:45.006 --> 27:49.086
I found out you were on Jake’s basketball team, after that it didn’t take a private eye.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.242
Oh, you know Jake?

27:50.370 --> 27:51.451
Pretty well, actually.

27:53.336 --> 27:54.712
Jenny’s my daughter.

27:57.441 --> 27:58.675
Small world, huh?

27:59.511 --> 28:03.995
Oh, look, Jake’s a good friend, okay? I had no idea.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.786
And neither did I and that’s why I don’t want you to say anything.

28:06.838 --> 28:08.185
I didn’t know who you were.

28:09.203 --> 28:14.670
Lucas, I’m trying to get my family back together, and it’s not going so well.

28:16.433 --> 28:21.808
Remember that night? What you told me about your dad? How you feel about him?

28:23.519 --> 28:26.518
I don’t want Jenny to ever say the same thing about me.

28:27.825 --> 28:30.743
I still have a chance to correct my mistake, Lucas.

28:32.386 --> 28:34.684
Please, don’t say anything.

28:44.542 --> 28:45.365
Keith?

28:47.947 --> 28:49.087
Hey, Luke.

28:49.538 --> 28:50.178
Hey.

28:50.711 --> 28:53.905
I called you a couple of times. How’ve you been?

28:53.967 --> 28:56.880
Nah, I’m good, it’s just, I’ve been dealing with some stuff.

28:56.932 --> 28:57.735
Yeah, me too.

28:59.494 --> 29:02.612
It’s really good to see you. How’s the rehab going?

29:02.768 --> 29:07.074
Oh, it’s good. It’s good. It should be ready for the playoffs.

29:07.182 --> 29:08.263
Yeah, you look a lot better.

29:09.634 --> 29:10.479
Sit down.

29:12.004 --> 29:13.091
How’s everything else?

29:15.788 --> 29:17.468
Like what?

29:17.564 --> 29:20.560
Like the rest of your life. What’s going on?

29:21.806 --> 29:23.443
There’s something I wanted to ask you.

29:23.653 --> 29:24.432
Sure.

29:25.010 --> 29:28.875
When my mom got pregnant, and Dan left,

29:30.264 --> 29:33.996
why didn’t you? Why’d you stand by her?

29:34.733 --> 29:37.928
Well, it was the right thing to do.

29:38.890 --> 29:43.672
And I loved her, and I wanted to protect her.

29:44.088 --> 29:46.929
But, she really didn’t need it.

29:47.650 --> 29:49.074
She’s pretty tough, huh?

29:49.365 --> 29:51.439
Your mom could have been anything in this life.

29:51.516 --> 29:52.939
Yeah, if it wasn’t for me.

29:53.969 --> 29:59.943
Luke, you’re the best thing that ever happened to your mom. Trust me.

30:00.508 --> 30:04.940
Look, Keith, I just wanted to apologize.

30:05.555 --> 30:09.727
For the way I acted when my mom was in Italy. Brooke and all.

30:10.680 --> 30:14.781
That’s water under the bridge. No damage done, right?

30:17.081 --> 30:17.776
Right.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.392
I should take off.

30:25.610 --> 30:26.329
Yeah.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.139
Uh, Luke.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.671
You know I’m proud of you, right?

30:33.746 --> 30:34.494
Sure.

30:35.057 --> 30:36.640
And I’ll always be there for you.

30:37.227 --> 30:40.469
You know, even if I’m not around as much.

30:41.575 --> 30:42.631
Yeah, I know.

30:44.815 --> 30:48.900
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything’s good.

30:50.206 --> 30:52.044
- Okay.
- Alright, I’ll see you.

30:52.889 --> 30:53.595
See ya.

31:03.346 --> 31:05.745
- Nathan, I know I’m driving you crazy.
- No you’re not.

31:05.802 --> 31:07.373
- Do you think that I’m a tease?
- Stop it.

31:07.444 --> 31:08.423
Well what do you think?

31:09.252 --> 31:12.360
I think that you’re my girlfriend, and I like to spend time with you.

31:15.110 --> 31:16.610
Look I just don’t want to push you.

31:17.506 --> 31:19.548
- You’re not.
- But I am.

31:20.793 --> 31:23.383
Haley, you got a tattoo for god sakes.

31:24.388 --> 31:27.188
It just freaks me out a little bit,

31:27.264 --> 31:30.966
because obviously this whole thing with us means a lot to you.

31:33.433 --> 31:36.849
I just don’t want to do anything to pressure you.

31:37.377 --> 31:38.596
Or drive you away.

31:39.906 --> 31:41.810
Even though sometimes I can’t help it.

31:43.843 --> 31:46.286
Just like I can’t help that I fell in love with you.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.283
Cause I did.

31:53.438 --> 31:54.931
I love you, Haley.

31:57.386 --> 31:58.799
And it scares me, a little bit,

31:58.855 --> 32:02.362
but, there it is.

32:04.487 --> 32:08.542
Wow. There it is.

32:18.460 --> 32:19.944
I love you too.

32:43.351 --> 32:45.936
- Something I can help you with?
- Not really.

32:47.328 --> 32:50.622
I just wanted to thank you for filling in some of the blanks for me about how you felt

32:50.699 --> 32:53.057
- when my mom got pregnant.
- Glad to be of help.

32:57.328 --> 32:58.844
How’s that situation with Brooke?

32:59.351 --> 33:00.524
None of your business.

33:01.874 --> 33:02.679
No?

33:04.737 --> 33:06.191
Isn’t that why you really came here?

33:06.775 --> 33:08.243
You know, before this happened to me,

33:09.106 --> 33:14.116
I never quite understood how you could be so selfish.

33:15.283 --> 33:17.521
Everyday of my life I wondered.

33:18.653 --> 33:19.912
Until now.

33:23.891 --> 33:25.380
Now you see the other side.

33:26.302 --> 33:27.439
Yeah, I guess I do.

33:29.871 --> 33:31.736
Don’t be so quick to judge me, Lucas.

33:32.774 --> 33:35.051
It’s easy to have all the answers from a distance.

33:35.262 --> 33:37.448
But everybody makes decisions they regret.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.188
Me. Your mother. Keith.

33:40.861 --> 33:43.767
But we learn to live with it. It’s part of life.

33:44.514 --> 33:45.691
Not my life.

33:47.130 --> 33:48.211
Not yet.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.375
Yeah. Yeah, I felt that once.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.876
Then I grew up.

34:03.113 --> 34:07.657
I was hoping you’d come by soon. We obviously need to talk.

34:09.061 --> 34:10.897
I’m going to make a change, Karen.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.378
What do you mean?

34:15.803 --> 34:22.992
Well, I woke up this morning and everything just felt far away.

34:23.938 --> 34:29.442
And then I went outside and for the first time, Tree Hill didn’t feel like home.

34:30.559 --> 34:35.534
And I just thought, why am I still here? You know?

34:36.702 --> 34:39.770
I never planned on spending my whole life here, and...

34:42.926 --> 34:45.033
I just needed someone to remind me.

34:45.786 --> 34:46.953
And you did that.

34:48.116 --> 34:49.369
And it’s okay.

34:50.216 --> 34:51.148
Are you leaving?

34:53.491 --> 34:55.447
There’s not time like the present, right?

34:56.783 --> 34:58.796
Keith, this isn’t because of me.

34:58.981 --> 35:02.749
No, it’s because of me.

35:03.399 --> 35:10.019
You did me a favor, Karen. By going to Italy, and by saying no to me.

35:10.106 --> 35:13.506
You woke me up. And I appreciate that.

35:15.723 --> 35:16.989
Where are you going to go?

35:17.530 --> 35:18.539
I don’t know.

35:21.124 --> 35:22.922
But I got to say.

35:25.747 --> 35:28.155
It feels really good to have options.

36:03.423 --> 36:06.136
What part of stay away from me do you not understand?

36:06.197 --> 36:07.882
Just give me 60 seconds, okay?

36:07.988 --> 36:10.324
I’m sorry but argument cutoff was 9 o’clock.

36:10.620 --> 36:16.033
Well, I don’t want to argue. You don’t even have to say anything. Just listen.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.073
My dad didn’t want me, okay?

36:26.790 --> 36:31.996
Not just that he didn’t want to claim me, he didn’t want me to be born,

36:33.574 --> 36:39.537
I always thought that when I started a family I’d be, older,

36:40.465 --> 36:42.760
and settled, and I’d be...

36:42.897 --> 36:43.748
In love?

36:44.904 --> 36:45.606
Yeah.

36:48.908 --> 36:51.796
- But so did my mom.
- Lucas...

36:51.853 --> 36:56.076
No, this whole thing scares the hell out of me, okay?

36:57.848 --> 37:01.914
But whatever you decide to do, I’ll be there.

37:03.460 --> 37:07.530
And if you’re not ready, then you’re not ready, but if you want to have this baby,

37:09.799 --> 37:11.155
then so do I.

37:13.502 --> 37:20.085
And whatever it takes for me to be a good father, I‘ll be there.

37:20.592 --> 37:23.592
Always. I promise you.

37:24.251 --> 37:26.704
I won‘t let you down.

37:32.430 --> 37:33.177
Hey.

37:37.201 --> 37:38.333
I lied.

37:41.915 --> 37:42.977
What?

37:43.663 --> 37:45.152
I’m not pregnant.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.203
- But I saw the test.
- I know.

37:50.274 --> 37:55.168
Then when the doctor called he said I wasn’t pregnant, he said that can happen.

37:55.890 --> 37:59.611
Okay, no, no, no. I was standing right there when he called.

37:59.688 --> 38:02.452
And you had just called me a slut.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.543
So you lied to me to punish me?!

38:06.401 --> 38:07.455
How could you do that?

38:07.506 --> 38:11.582
How could you cheat on me with my best friend?!

38:14.503 --> 38:19.022
Brooke. I never meant to hurt you.

38:19.994 --> 38:22.330
That doesn’t really matter, Lucas.

38:22.857 --> 38:25.457
Cause in the end it all hurts just the same.

40:03.253 --> 40:04.806
Brooke’s not pregnant.

40:07.721 --> 40:09.022
It was just a scare.

40:13.763 --> 40:14.985
Are you okay?

40:18.064 --> 40:19.195
Not really.

40:30.105 --> 40:31.898
Mom, thanks.

40:32.942 --> 40:33.972
For what?

40:34.856 --> 40:36.249
Everything.
