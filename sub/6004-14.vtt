11:13.139 --> 11:14.339
I am Groot.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.107
(CHUCKLES) Nice going.
For a minute there,

11:16.109 --> 11:19.110
I believed we was
all gonna be paste.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.679
(DRIPPING)
Oh, what now?

11:22.281 --> 11:23.882
We've had fire, air, earth.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.450
(RUMBLING)
What's next?

11:25.452 --> 11:27.686
Whoa! Ow!

11:29.655 --> 11:31.389
The glyph
is in the next chamber,

11:31.391 --> 11:32.757
but I cannot access it.

11:34.326 --> 11:36.561
We have to shut off
the water supply.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.229
I cannot swim!

11:38.231 --> 11:40.465
Can't believe
I'm doing this.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.370
(GRUNTING)

12:06.659 --> 12:09.227
(ALL BREATHING HEAVILY)

12:11.430 --> 12:14.332
You must be true friends
of the Star-Lord.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.469
By virtue of belief,
you have survived the tests.

12:19.605 --> 12:23.108
DRAX: We survived
thanks to our skills
and teamwork.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.744
If she wants to believe
that malarkey, let her.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.113
We gotta find Quill
and get outta here.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.516
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

12:31.518 --> 12:34.185
Who are you?
How did you get down here?

12:34.187 --> 12:37.021
We are here to free
the Star-Lord.

12:37.023 --> 12:40.358
I believe you will
give me the key,

12:40.360 --> 12:41.459
and leave us.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.101
How did you do that?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.137
Still you doubt
the power of belief.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.708
Steady. Almost there.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.310
And... Gotcha!

12:59.312 --> 13:00.545
Oh, hi, guys.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.313
Uh, this isn't
what it looks like.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.716
I'm escaping. Whoa!

13:04.718 --> 13:06.484
(GROANING)
You are correct, Quill.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.219
This does not
look like escaping.

13:08.221 --> 13:11.422
Did we really need to see ya
in your boxers twice?

13:11.424 --> 13:15.460
We believed,
and so you are free,
great Star-Lord.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.329
Oh, hey,
it's the True Believer lady.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.833
I believe you should
put on your pants
so we can get out of here.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.437
Eh, hold up.
My stuff's in this vault.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.406
I'll get it open.
Stand back.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.341
You want to alert
the whole palace?

13:30.343 --> 13:34.779
The vault will open
for the Star-Lord
if he believes.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.815
Okay.

13:36.817 --> 13:41.119
I believe I can
open this vault.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.254
(WHIRRING)

13:44.356 --> 13:47.458
(CHUCKLING)
No way! It worked!

13:47.460 --> 13:51.563
I believe you are
the one true Star-Lord
the prophecy has foretold.

13:52.598 --> 13:55.200
Ugh! I believe
I'm gonna hurl.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.534
Let us leave this place.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.869
PETER: Not so fast.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.471
That Cosmic Seed energy
my Boom Box picked up,

14:00.473 --> 14:03.174
it's coming
from inside the palace.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.542
We gotta check it out.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.714
Reading's coming
from behind those doors.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.149
Only two guards.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.284
I wish to try
this power of belief.

14:20.359 --> 14:24.829
Halt! The king is not
receiving visitors.

14:24.831 --> 14:28.366
I believe
you will let me pass!

14:33.305 --> 14:34.839
I am Groot?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.941
Nobody's home.
Let's go.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.611
Uh...

14:43.883 --> 14:45.049
I didn't do it!

14:47.219 --> 14:49.554
They don't look
like they believe you.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.897
You do not need
your weapons.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.999
The power of belief
will protect you.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.401
You are the mighty Star-Lord
of prophecy,

15:03.403 --> 15:05.703
destined to rescue us
from tyranny.

15:05.705 --> 15:09.440
I believe in you.
Now you must believe
in yourself.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.444
I believe
you will not harm me.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.513
Quill,
what are you doing?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.351
I am Groot?

15:20.353 --> 15:22.253
Hey, guys,
it totally worked!

15:25.090 --> 15:28.059
I am Groot!

15:28.061 --> 15:30.595
Yeah. Totally worked.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.631
I believe the best defense
is a good offense.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.133
(GRUNTING)

15:35.135 --> 15:37.468
Finally,
someone's talking sense.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.608
(GRUNTS)

15:43.610 --> 15:46.711
Let's try a little something
I call "blam in a can."

15:46.713 --> 15:48.413
Open wide!

15:48.415 --> 15:49.480
(YELLS) What!

15:49.482 --> 15:51.382
(BEEPING)

15:53.652 --> 15:54.519
(YELLS)

15:57.756 --> 16:00.325
Check it out.
They're leaving me alone.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.994
Oh, you guys should really
try this believing thing.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.936
I am Groot!

16:11.938 --> 16:14.305
(COUGHING)

16:14.307 --> 16:16.307
Thanks for the save, pal.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.846
(GRUNTS)

16:21.848 --> 16:23.081
A little help?

16:23.083 --> 16:24.315
I believe I can do that.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.018
GAMORA: Keep doing
what you're doing.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.486
What, nothing?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.154
It's finally become
an advantage.

16:39.431 --> 16:42.600
I am Groot!

16:44.169 --> 16:45.937
(STRAINING)

16:53.512 --> 16:54.579
(GRUNTS)

16:56.515 --> 16:57.582
(GRUNTS)

17:00.519 --> 17:01.986
Ha!

17:01.988 --> 17:04.489
And that's the end of... Huh?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.891
Oh! Whoa!

17:09.028 --> 17:11.029
Let go!
Drop him, big guy!

17:12.231 --> 17:14.065
Ah! (GRUNTS)

17:14.067 --> 17:16.233
Hey, I think
I can control it!

17:16.236 --> 17:18.002
Do you believe it?

17:18.003 --> 17:19.704
Hey, metal man,

17:19.705 --> 17:22.440
I believe you will smash
that other robot.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.550
Oh, yes!
My own giant robot!

17:32.552 --> 17:33.584
This is turning into
the best day ever!

17:33.586 --> 17:34.652
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

17:36.889 --> 17:38.923
Who dares enter my palace?

17:38.925 --> 17:42.393
Hey! It's that dude
from all the statues.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.663
Your days as King of Spartax
are numbered, J'Son.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.866
Behold, I have brought
the Star-Lord.

17:48.868 --> 17:52.136
There is no Star-Lord.
Destroy the intruders.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.606
I believe
you can't harm me.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.075
Take your best shot.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.309
(BEEPING)

17:59.611 --> 18:03.347
See? Okay, metal man,
blast King Jerkface.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.618
Enough.
I'll deal with you myself.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.254
(GUNS POWERING UP)

18:15.227 --> 18:16.360
Peter?

18:17.362 --> 18:18.429
What did you call me?

18:18.797 --> 18:20.264
Peter.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.201
But they told me
you perished.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.303
How do you know my name?

18:25.305 --> 18:27.572
I helped Meredith
pick it out.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.774
How do you know
my mother's name?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.643
Oh, really?
He's your father, dummy!

18:36.482 --> 18:38.983
My ship crash-landed
on Earth.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.786
Meredith Quill found me
and nursed me back to health.

18:43.055 --> 18:46.057
We fell in love.
One thing led to another...

18:46.059 --> 18:47.959
Okay. Enough.
Oh, ew, ew!

18:47.961 --> 18:50.061
That's my mom
you're talking about.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.796
And that's
my Element Blaster.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.432
I left it for you.

18:54.434 --> 18:58.102
So, if you're my dad,
and you're a king,

18:58.104 --> 19:00.571
does that make me
a prince?

19:00.573 --> 19:03.407
The official title
is "Star-Lord."

19:03.409 --> 19:06.144
What a coincidence!
My mom used to call me Star...

19:06.146 --> 19:07.979
That's not a coincidence
at all, is it?

19:07.981 --> 19:10.448
That's why you can control
everything in the palace.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.151
It's all keyed
to the family DNA.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.986
Oh. You know, then,
I should've known

19:14.988 --> 19:17.688
the whole
"power of belief" thing
was too good to be true.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.358
It is true.
The false king will perish,

19:20.360 --> 19:22.093
and the Believers
will rule the galaxy.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.698
Nobody tries
to assassinate my dad.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.301
Take this traitor
to the dungeon!

19:30.303 --> 19:34.672
So, Mantis was manipulating us
just to get close enough
to attack the king.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.607
Most dishonorable.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.643
Aw!

19:38.645 --> 19:40.711
Does this mean
there's no such thing
as the Star-Lord prophecy?

19:40.713 --> 19:43.681
There is
if you believe there is.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.850
Your days are numbered,
false king!

19:45.852 --> 19:48.319
You cannot stop
the Believers!

19:48.321 --> 19:50.021
(DOOR CLOSES)

19:52.658 --> 19:54.825
What do you have there?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.761
How did you come to possess
my CryptoCube?

19:57.296 --> 19:58.796
Long story.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.300
How come you're giving off
Cosmic Seed energy?

20:02.302 --> 20:04.569
Long story,
which we can share later,

20:04.571 --> 20:07.471
after I attend to some
important matters of state.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.141
I'm also curious to know
how you came to associate

20:10.143 --> 20:11.609
with known criminals.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.146
We had a little
misunderstanding

20:15.148 --> 20:16.747
down at the spaceport.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.250
Why am I not surprised?

20:19.252 --> 20:21.219
You let me handle it.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.755
I can do that, right?
Seeing as I am
the Star-Lord and all?

20:24.757 --> 20:26.557
My subjects
are yours to command.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.827
Yes! I am the one
true Star-Lord!

20:29.829 --> 20:31.162
Whoo!

20:31.164 --> 20:33.931
And you thought he was
hard to live with before.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.604
(BEEPING)

20:40.872 --> 20:43.908
<i>You have been lying to me,</i>
<i>J'Son of Spartax.</i>

20:43.910 --> 20:46.377
<i>Your son is alive.</i>

20:46.379 --> 20:49.247
I only just found out myself,
Lord Thanos.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.883
<i>This Star-Lord</i>
<i>dares to defy me.</i>

20:52.885 --> 20:54.885
<i>I would have his head.</i>

20:54.887 --> 20:58.256
He has the CryptoCube
and is the only one
who can use it.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.925
We need him
to find the Cosmic Seed.

21:00.927 --> 21:05.696
<i>Then he will remain alive</i>
<i>only so long as he is useful.</i>

21:05.698 --> 21:08.733
<i>Once Star-Lord</i>
<i>finds the Cosmic Seed,</i>

21:08.735 --> 21:11.135
<i>you will deliver</i>
<i>them both to me.</i>

21:15.874 --> 21:17.642
Hey, you missed a spot.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.645
(MUTTERING)

21:20.647 --> 21:25.082
You heard the Star-Lord.
Put your backs into it!

21:25.084 --> 21:27.084
You maggots act like
ya never seen soap and water

21:27.086 --> 21:29.053
in your pathetic,
worthless lives!

21:30.956 --> 21:34.058
But that's just my opinion.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.227
Got a problem with that?
Talk to the prince!
