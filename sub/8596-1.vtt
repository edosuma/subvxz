WEBVTT

00:01.711 --> 00:03.713
We were born in space.

00:03.922 --> 00:06.299
They told us the ground
was uninhabited,

00:06.508 --> 00:08.301
but they were wrong,
and we've been fighting

00:08.510 --> 00:11.846
for our lives since
the moment we landed.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.516
Some of us have been
broken by it,

00:14.724 --> 00:16.476
but most of us are still here,

00:16.685 --> 00:18.895
searching for other survivors
from the ark,

00:19.104 --> 00:21.189
trying to build something
real and lasting

00:21.398 --> 00:23.608
out of the wilderness--a home.

00:23.817 --> 00:25.318
Our leaders believe
that to survive,

00:25.527 --> 00:28.113
we need to make peace
with the grounders,

00:28.321 --> 00:32.409
but peace
is a foreign concept here.

00:32.617 --> 00:34.828
I'm not going in.

00:35.036 --> 00:35.954
Clarke--

00:36.162 --> 00:37.747
seeing their faces
every day

00:37.956 --> 00:39.207
is just gonna remind me
of what I did

00:39.416 --> 00:41.084
to get them here.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.169
May we meet again.

00:43.378 --> 00:45.046
We're going to
the city of light.

00:45.255 --> 00:47.340
Take this leap of faith
with me, John Murphy.

00:47.549 --> 00:51.261
Welcome, Thelonious.
I've been waiting for ages.

00:51.469 --> 00:52.887
My name is Alie

00:55.390 --> 00:59.185
I tried to stop her.
I'm so, so sorry.

01:12.574 --> 01:15.493
Containment door sealed.

01:15.702 --> 01:18.329
Come on. Come on.

01:18.538 --> 01:20.415
Come on!

01:20.623 --> 01:23.126
Chris,
where are you, man?

01:24.461 --> 01:27.630
Chris? Chris?

01:29.799 --> 01:31.051
Chris!

01:33.261 --> 01:34.846
I knew it.
The news was wrong.

01:35.055 --> 01:36.723
It wasn't China.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.475
The stupid son of a bitch
let Alie out.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.727
Help me.
The radiation's coming.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.479
Unless we want to share
this place with a corpse,

01:42.687 --> 01:44.647
we need to get him
outside.

01:44.856 --> 01:48.318
Come on. Ugh!

01:54.449 --> 01:55.950
Arrgh!

02:04.084 --> 02:09.255
I tried to stop her,
but I lost control.

02:11.007 --> 02:13.176
I'm so, so sorry.

02:14.761 --> 02:16.554
2051. Becca,
meet Alie

02:16.763 --> 02:18.181
Chris, I got to get
back to work.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.767
We are working.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.812
Alie wanted it
to be a surprise.

02:26.773 --> 02:29.275
Hello, Becca.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.195
Who did this?

02:32.403 --> 02:36.199
I did.
You don't approve?

02:36.407 --> 02:38.076
As you know,
I didn't think

02:38.284 --> 02:39.744
I needed an avatar.

02:39.953 --> 02:42.580
You did.

02:42.789 --> 02:44.707
Why not my creator?

02:44.916 --> 02:45.959
Why not
my creator?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.293
Why not my creator?

02:47.502 --> 02:49.087
Please state
your core command.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.798
My core command is
to make life better...

02:52.006 --> 02:53.007
To make
life better...

02:53.216 --> 02:54.384
To make life better.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.511
How would
you do that?

02:56.719 --> 02:58.096
By fixing
the root problem.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.597
Waah!

02:59.806 --> 03:01.182
By fixing
the root problem.

03:01.391 --> 03:03.852
By fixing the
root problem.

03:04.060 --> 03:07.313
What is the
root problem, Alie?

03:07.522 --> 03:10.400
Too many people.

03:10.608 --> 03:12.610
Um, too many people?

03:12.819 --> 03:14.195
Too many people.

03:14.404 --> 03:18.158
Ah, well, you certainly
took care of that, didn't you?

03:18.366 --> 03:20.076
Yaah!

03:21.828 --> 03:24.497
86 days,

03:24.706 --> 03:27.667
on my, um, last box
of food, so--

03:31.963 --> 03:35.425
really never thought
I'd miss the ark this much,

03:35.633 --> 03:38.803
but anyway, Jaha,
if you're seeing this,

03:39.012 --> 03:41.472
that would indeed mean
you're not dead,

03:41.681 --> 03:45.727
so screw you!

03:55.111 --> 03:56.946
Oh, come on.

04:03.494 --> 04:04.537
I--

04:05.663 --> 04:08.374
mm...

04:10.877 --> 04:12.879
Containment door released.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.279
Wait! Get back here.

04:40.406 --> 04:41.950
Uh!

04:53.544 --> 04:55.046
Uh!

04:55.255 --> 04:56.673
John.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.803
There you are.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.097
- Jaha.
- Welcome.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.352
We have so much
to talk about

05:09.560 --> 05:12.647
and so little time.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.732
I found it, John.

05:14.941 --> 05:16.985
The city of light
is real.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.990
You let me live!

05:22.198 --> 05:23.324
OK.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.129
Uh!

06:19.422 --> 06:20.465
Oh!

06:20.673 --> 06:23.676
Ah! Uhh...

06:24.844 --> 06:26.679
Ohh!

06:26.888 --> 06:28.473
Yah! Hah!

06:34.604 --> 06:36.147
Huh!

06:41.444 --> 06:44.906
He had me,
but he was too aggressive.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.324
Whatever you say.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.911
Quitting so soon?

06:50.119 --> 06:52.705
Mapping run,
sector 7.

06:52.914 --> 06:55.500
Harper, let's get
this over with.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.880
Council wants you
to have that.

07:01.089 --> 07:02.965
I'm Trikru.

07:03.174 --> 07:05.301
Uniform doesn't
change that.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.678
This is our home
now, Lincoln.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.847
We fought for it.

07:10.056 --> 07:12.141
Too many of our friends
died for it.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.894
In the ark, the uniform
meant something different.

07:15.103 --> 07:18.147
Down here, it means
what we make it mean

07:18.356 --> 07:19.774
together.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.860
My sister will understand
that eventually.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.948
Pair up
and fight now.

07:29.534 --> 07:32.537
Hey, sector 7,
that puts you

07:32.745 --> 07:34.163
right at the
ice nation border.

07:34.372 --> 07:35.373
Yeah. I know.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.707
Just because Azgeda
was part

07:36.916 --> 07:38.084
of the commander's
coalition, doesn't mean

07:38.292 --> 07:40.044
they respect
the cease-fire.

07:40.253 --> 07:41.963
- I should be on that scout.
- I wish.

07:42.130 --> 07:43.881
We all do, but until
the commander agrees

07:44.090 --> 07:46.008
to lift the kill
order on you,

07:46.217 --> 07:48.803
you're more trouble
than you're worth.

08:02.567 --> 08:05.027
This is the first sleep the
chancellor's had in two days.

08:05.236 --> 08:06.737
I'll be quick, then.

08:06.946 --> 08:08.698
We're going
into sector 7.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.159
I think we should arm
the entire unit.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.953
Permission granted,
but the rules

08:14.162 --> 08:16.038
of engagement
still apply--

08:16.247 --> 08:17.457
nonlethal response.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.375
Copy that.

08:19.584 --> 08:22.670
Bellamy, there
hasn't been an attack

08:22.879 --> 08:25.131
since mount weather.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.049
It's 3 months.

08:27.258 --> 08:30.303
Our people believe
that this is real peace.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.430
Try not to screw
that up.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.058
Yes, sir.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.021
He's come
a long way.

08:41.397 --> 08:44.984
It's a work
in progress.

08:45.193 --> 08:48.112
I was dreaming
we were in the ark

08:48.321 --> 08:50.948
before we sent
the kids down.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.253
Maybe she's
in sector 7.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.839
We could send out
another search party.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.511
They wouldn't
find her,

09:11.719 --> 09:14.263
not unless she's
ready to be found.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.974
Sir. Ma'am.

09:17.183 --> 09:19.101
I have patients
to see.

09:21.312 --> 09:23.314
Sir, we just got
a signal

09:23.523 --> 09:25.233
on a secure channel,
3 clicks.

09:25.441 --> 09:27.485
3 clicks.

09:27.693 --> 09:31.155
She wants to meet.

09:36.786 --> 09:39.830
Monty, why aren't
you ready?

09:40.039 --> 09:43.918
I am. He's not.

09:54.971 --> 09:58.057
What should
we do?

09:58.266 --> 10:00.601
We should leave him
this time.

10:00.810 --> 10:02.687
He's not
getting better.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.940
Maya's death broke him.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.109
He needs this.

10:12.405 --> 10:13.948
Take an arm.

10:15.491 --> 10:18.744
- Come on. Uh!
- Ohh!

10:18.953 --> 10:21.581
Uhh...

10:28.504 --> 10:30.172
Zeke, I said
produce first.

10:30.381 --> 10:31.549
Art doesn't
go bad.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.218
Monty, he's all yours.

10:35.469 --> 10:39.432
Hey, easy run?

10:39.640 --> 10:42.059
I hate that place.

10:42.268 --> 10:44.770
I know.

10:46.314 --> 10:49.191
Got you something,
though.

10:53.446 --> 10:57.658
You said your mom
used to read this to you.

10:57.867 --> 11:01.746
Thought
you'd like it.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.790
I do. Thanks.

11:11.339 --> 11:13.966
Hey!
Take it easy.

11:14.175 --> 11:16.052
Good morning
to you, too.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.553
Ah! Uh...

11:19.347 --> 11:20.848
What's the point if
we can't shoot them?

11:21.057 --> 11:23.267
We can, just not to kill.
That goes for everyone.

11:23.476 --> 11:24.435
Where's Octavia?

11:24.644 --> 11:25.686
We're going
outside the wall.

11:25.895 --> 11:27.938
You honestly think
she'd miss that?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.359
Ah!

11:31.567 --> 11:34.028
Sorry.
Was that too cold?

11:34.236 --> 11:36.113
Aah!

11:40.618 --> 11:44.163
No gun for you, not
till you're sober.

11:44.372 --> 11:45.831
Don't want one.

11:50.086 --> 11:52.380
Let's do this.

11:52.588 --> 11:53.964
Mm!

11:54.173 --> 11:56.717
Uh... Mm.

11:56.926 --> 11:58.719
Be safe.

12:07.812 --> 12:09.647
- She's too good for you.
- Shut up.

12:09.855 --> 12:12.566
Careful.
Monty might melt her.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.402
Enough!

12:14.610 --> 12:18.197
Raven, take us out.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.420
Guess we found her.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.880
Try to keep up.

Tracking beacon
from the ark.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.439
Hey, that was
the best part.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.275
Who is it?

15:01.902 --> 15:04.238
Farm station.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.490
What?
After--after 4 months? How?

15:06.699 --> 15:08.325
We'll find out.
Where are they?

15:10.119 --> 15:12.204
Don't tell me
I missed the party.

15:12.413 --> 15:13.747
Sector 8.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.124
That's
ice nation.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.417
What about it?

15:16.625 --> 15:17.751
Protocol says
we go home,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.545
let the chancellor
decide what to do next.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.171
Screw protocol.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.882
The chancellor's
not from farm station.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.093
Monty is. So is
Miller's boyfriend.

15:26.302 --> 15:28.929
It's your call.

15:29.138 --> 15:30.931
Let's do this.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.058
You have
to ask?

15:33.267 --> 15:34.977
Try to keep up.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.899
Yah!

16:16.852 --> 16:18.604
Jaha.

16:19.939 --> 16:22.733
Hey, wake up.

16:22.942 --> 16:26.111
Thelonious
isn't here, John.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.781
He's in the
city of light.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.866
I know what you are.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.082
It's refreshing
to be around people

16:38.290 --> 16:41.251
who understand
technology again.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.046
Let us explain.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.090
That's a good idea.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.591
Why don't you start
with why you kept me

16:47.800 --> 16:48.801
locked in a bunker
while you were here

16:49.009 --> 16:50.427
living like a king?

16:50.636 --> 16:53.180
The outside world
means nothing.

16:53.389 --> 16:55.265
In the city of light,
we're all kings.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.351
Here I thought I was
the one losing my mind.

16:57.559 --> 17:01.146
It's the truth.
I can show you.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.648
OK. You do know she's
the one who launched

17:02.856 --> 17:05.776
the bombs that ended
the world, right?

17:05.985 --> 17:07.903
Wrong.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.533
She didn't
end the world.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.618
She saved it.

17:18.956 --> 17:20.749
I'm so out of here.

17:22.209 --> 17:26.463
Let him go.
He'll come around.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.437
These woods
must be the border.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.522
So where's
all the ice?

17:43.731 --> 17:44.857
Much further
north.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.775
Azgeda stretches
for a thousand Miles.

17:46.984 --> 17:49.111
Good thing we only
have to go 200 meters.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.320
Slow down.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.697
Remember, rules
of engagement

17:51.905 --> 17:53.490
are nonlethal
force.

17:53.699 --> 17:54.908
Tight formation
on my command.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.994
- Raven, you stay in the rover.
- Yeah, right.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.495
We need every
gun we've got.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.289
They're coming.

18:00.497 --> 18:03.709
120 meters...
110.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.003
They're our people.
What are you doing?

18:06.211 --> 18:09.048
We hope they're
our people.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.549
On my command.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.561
Ice nation?

18:22.770 --> 18:25.647
Yes.
White war paint.

18:25.856 --> 18:26.940
Whoa!

18:30.069 --> 18:32.613
Stay calm.

18:35.074 --> 18:36.200
Skaikru.

18:43.082 --> 18:44.833
They think we're
looking for Wanheda.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.169
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.713
The light.
That's the beacon.

18:53.425 --> 18:54.259
Hey, get
back here.

18:54.468 --> 18:55.260
Jasper,
what are you--

18:55.469 --> 18:56.386
what are you doing?

18:56.595 --> 18:57.763
- Jasper--
- it's OK. I got this.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.139
Tell them we observe
the commander's truce.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.182
Do it now.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.480
This belongs to us.

19:25.749 --> 19:26.792
Hold your fire!

19:27.000 --> 19:29.419
Jasper, get down. Hah!

19:39.638 --> 19:41.265
Kane, on radio:
Rover one, come in.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.808
Repeat, rover one, come in now.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.643
- What now?
- Bellamy, where are you?

19:44.852 --> 19:45.853
I had him.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.020
What the hell
were you thinking?

19:47.229 --> 19:49.022
We got the beacon,
didn't we? Uh!

19:49.231 --> 19:50.315
Yeah, but where
did they get it?

19:50.524 --> 19:52.025
Oh, he needs to
get to medical.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.069
We had to shoot
3 ice nation scouts.

19:54.278 --> 19:55.737
Covert, sector 4. Copy.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.156
Can you tell me
what's going on?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.991
When you get here.
Over and out.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.911
Sector 4? Why is Kane
so far outside the wall?

20:03.120 --> 20:04.413
Take him home!

20:04.621 --> 20:05.789
I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

20:05.998 --> 20:06.915
- Miller...
- Yeah?

20:07.124 --> 20:07.916
Get one
of their horses.

20:08.125 --> 20:08.917
Raven, since
you can't ride,

20:09.126 --> 20:09.918
you're on the back.

20:10.127 --> 20:10.919
Monty, you're
with me.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.379
- Let's go.
- OK.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.487
You were right
about Jasper, OK?

20:37.696 --> 20:38.947
Is that what you
want me to say?

20:39.156 --> 20:40.908
Quiet. Keep
your eyes peeled.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.368
I could've said no.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.454
He's getting worse,
isn't he?

20:45.662 --> 20:46.914
I mean, getting
drunk every night

20:47.122 --> 20:48.290
is one thing,
but smiling

20:48.498 --> 20:49.791
with a knife
to your throat,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.793
that's next-level
damaged.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.715
Who's he with?

20:56.924 --> 20:59.009
- Indra.
- That's Indra?

20:59.218 --> 21:00.886
He must've told her
we broke the truce.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.804
Sir, before you say anything,
there was a good reason--

21:03.013 --> 21:04.431
we'll deal
with that later.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.308
This is
about Clarke.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.019
- What about her?
- She's being hunted.

21:09.228 --> 21:12.981
- By who?
- By everyone.

21:38.131 --> 21:38.966
Aah!

21:40.175 --> 21:41.843
Uh! Ah!

21:53.355 --> 21:55.274
Uh! Uh!

21:57.609 --> 21:58.902
Ow...

23:22.819 --> 23:24.112
Open the gate!

23:24.321 --> 23:27.491
Jasper's hurt.
What took you so long?

23:31.328 --> 23:32.913
Oh, what happened?

23:33.080 --> 23:34.039
Ice nation.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.374
Nngh!

23:37.626 --> 23:39.002
Get him to medical.

23:39.211 --> 23:41.338
I got you.
Keep pressure on it.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.425
Clarke?

23:53.809 --> 23:54.976
You want me
to take them?

23:55.185 --> 23:56.978
It's OK. I'll--
I'll bring her in.

24:02.109 --> 24:04.111
You can't get down,
can you?

24:07.322 --> 24:09.408
OK. Come here.

24:09.616 --> 24:10.409
Ah ah!

24:10.617 --> 24:11.785
OK.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.830
Uh... Ah. Uh!

24:15.038 --> 24:16.665
Thanks.

24:16.873 --> 24:19.918
- Raven--
- I'm good.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.564
I'm still getting
used to it myself.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.774
Sir, we're
almost out of range.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.901
Are you sure you don't want
to tell the chancellor?

24:45.110 --> 24:48.447
I'm sure. I don't want to worry
Abby until we know something.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.490
We know there's
a kill order.

24:50.699 --> 24:51.908
You people
are big on those.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.369
It's not a kill order.
It's a bounty.

24:54.578 --> 24:55.996
Clarke's a symbol.

24:56.204 --> 24:59.833
She's known as Wanheda--
the commander of death.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.460
The ice nation guys
we killed

25:01.668 --> 25:03.545
asked about Wanheda.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.964
They're looking
for Clarke. Why?

25:06.173 --> 25:08.592
My people believe that
when you kill someone,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.594
you get their power.

25:10.802 --> 25:13.346
Kill Wanheda,
and you command death.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.890
She's just
one girl.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.641
So was the commander.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.935
What Clarke did
at mount weather weakened her.

25:19.144 --> 25:20.979
The ice nation
is emboldened.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.690
Their queen
wants Clarke's power.

25:23.899 --> 25:25.942
If her people
believe she has it,

25:26.151 --> 25:29.154
she'll break the coalition
and start a war.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.323
I can't let that happen.

25:32.866 --> 25:35.076
Welcome to sector 7.
Where to now?

25:35.285 --> 25:37.537
If she's here,
she'll need supplies.

25:37.746 --> 25:41.291
We'll start
at the trading posts.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.781
I would wait,

27:36.990 --> 27:39.200
give them the chance
to clear out.

27:40.869 --> 27:43.288
Have that drink.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.749
Why are you
helping me?

27:45.957 --> 27:49.252
My mother was taken
by the Mountain.

27:49.461 --> 27:51.421
You ended the reaping.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.395
You wanted
to see me?

28:07.604 --> 28:10.940
Yes. I'm
considering making

28:11.149 --> 28:12.692
another run
to mount weather

28:12.901 --> 28:14.653
for medical
supplies.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.029
You want my advice?

28:16.237 --> 28:18.198
That's
why you're here.

28:18.365 --> 28:22.243
The last one
just got back.

28:22.452 --> 28:26.748
If it looks like Skaikru
is colonizing the Mountain,

28:26.956 --> 28:29.959
the truce will break,
and we'll be at war.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.672
Jasper, wait.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.798
Whoa!

28:35.006 --> 28:35.924
He hasn't been
discharged.

28:36.132 --> 28:37.258
- I'm fine.
- He's not fine.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.095
Shut up, raven.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.305
OK, OK. Enough.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.265
If you promise to come
back in the morning,

28:44.474 --> 28:47.143
I will examine you
then, OK?

28:48.937 --> 28:51.981
You're just gonna
let him go?

28:52.190 --> 28:55.110
That'll be all, Lincoln.
Thank you.

28:56.945 --> 28:58.571
I'll be in there
in a minute.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.240
Abby, we have
12 patients waiting,

29:00.448 --> 29:04.285
including 4 contraceptive
implant removals.

29:04.494 --> 29:07.622
You'll be right in.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.625
Abby, he had a knife
to his throat,

29:10.834 --> 29:12.293
and he smiled.

29:12.502 --> 29:15.922
I want to talk
about you, raven.

29:16.131 --> 29:19.968
How's your hip?

29:20.176 --> 29:23.054
You don't have a broken
compressor, do you?

29:23.263 --> 29:25.682
When did
the pain start?

29:27.851 --> 29:30.270
After the explosion
at the dam.

29:30.478 --> 29:31.646
3 months.

29:31.855 --> 29:33.106
It's nothing
I can't handle.

29:33.314 --> 29:34.983
You're not handling it.

29:35.191 --> 29:36.651
You're lying
to your friends.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.446
You're lying to your doctor.

29:39.654 --> 29:41.614
You pushed wick away
because he was trying to help.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.158
- Don't.
- Raven, you don't--

29:43.366 --> 29:45.785
fix yourself, Abby.

29:45.994 --> 29:48.246
Maybe if you weren't
so busy being chancellor

29:48.455 --> 29:50.707
and doctor to avoid
your own pain,

29:50.915 --> 29:55.003
you'd realize you
suck at both jobs.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.505
Good talk.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.436
The cat got
the worst of it.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.117
No kill marks.

30:27.577 --> 30:30.830
My back's
not big enough.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.711
Tell me about
the Mountain.

30:41.883 --> 30:45.428
There's nothing to tell.

30:45.637 --> 30:47.180
I did what I had to do.
That's all.

30:47.388 --> 30:50.266
That's all? You killed
our greatest enemy.

30:50.475 --> 30:52.018
You wiped them out
by yourself.

30:52.227 --> 30:56.231
Niylah, would you mind
not talking?

30:59.984 --> 31:01.903
No.

31:14.457 --> 31:16.334
Mm...

31:16.543 --> 31:17.502
Mm...

31:45.989 --> 31:48.783
Oh, yes...

32:14.517 --> 32:16.477
Hey.

32:21.566 --> 32:24.485
There can't be an us or them
if we want to survive.

32:24.694 --> 32:25.945
You're being naive.

32:26.154 --> 32:28.907
Those people aren't
like you, Lincoln.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.367
Kane and Abby aren't
like most people.

32:31.576 --> 32:33.536
They're trying to forge
a lasting peace, and so am I.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.038
They're using you.

32:35.246 --> 32:37.832
"Look at that nice grounder
in his uniform."

32:38.041 --> 32:39.417
They think it proves
we can live together.

32:39.626 --> 32:41.669
It does.

32:41.878 --> 32:44.380
What if I don't want
to live together?

32:44.589 --> 32:46.049
And don't tell me
about the kill order.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.383
We can go far away.

32:47.592 --> 32:48.635
Luna's clan
will take us in.

32:48.843 --> 32:51.137
No. They won't.

32:51.346 --> 32:54.057
Luna's hiding
for a reason.

32:54.265 --> 32:57.185
She won't risk
the attention.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.106
Hey, hey...

33:03.483 --> 33:04.484
Hey...

33:14.160 --> 33:17.789
And nothing can take
that away from us.

33:20.875 --> 33:24.253
That uniform does.

33:52.240 --> 33:55.660
You're leaving, huh?

33:55.868 --> 33:56.995
So are you.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.913
Not with you,
I'm not.

33:59.122 --> 34:00.999
I'll be right there,
Gideon.

34:01.207 --> 34:04.669
I see you've
made a new friend.

34:08.131 --> 34:12.301
I'm sorry we kept you
in the bunker, John.

34:12.510 --> 34:15.096
Is that what
you want to hear?

34:15.304 --> 34:17.056
Well, the truth is,
I knew you were safe,

34:17.265 --> 34:19.267
and with all the things
that we had to do,

34:19.475 --> 34:21.102
I needed the time.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.312
Yeah. I could tell you
were pretty busy back there.

34:23.521 --> 34:25.440
We converted
a nuclear warhead

34:25.648 --> 34:27.191
into a power source.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.360
With the added power,
Alie was able

34:29.569 --> 34:31.029
to complete
the work she began

34:31.237 --> 34:32.947
with her creator
a hundred years ago.

34:33.156 --> 34:36.534
Whatever. Look. I'm still
leaving this place in a rowboat.

34:36.743 --> 34:38.745
I need you.

34:38.953 --> 34:41.205
Of course you do,

34:41.414 --> 34:44.125
more food for
the sea monster, right?

34:44.333 --> 34:46.085
Let me prove to you
what we can do.

34:46.294 --> 34:48.296
Listen to me.
I've seen what she can do.

34:48.504 --> 34:51.007
No. You haven't,

34:51.215 --> 34:53.468
not even close, son.

34:53.676 --> 34:56.429
Now, how is it possible you
sound even crazier than before?

34:56.637 --> 35:00.224
I can tell you about
the city of light,

35:00.433 --> 35:02.727
but you won't
understand

35:02.935 --> 35:05.354
until you experience
it yourself.

35:07.857 --> 35:10.485
And that's supposed to take me
to the city of light?

35:10.693 --> 35:12.153
No pain, no hate,
no envy.

35:12.361 --> 35:13.362
No, thanks.

35:13.571 --> 35:14.864
- John--
- no.

35:15.073 --> 35:19.368
Pain, hate, envy--

35:19.577 --> 35:22.663
those are
the ABC's of me.

35:22.872 --> 35:24.248
Hey, get rid of them,
and there's nothing left,

35:24.457 --> 35:28.336
so why don't you get
that thing out of my face?

35:28.544 --> 35:31.839
Take care
of yourself, John,

35:32.048 --> 35:33.883
and decide later.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.103
John?

35:45.311 --> 35:48.147
I don't
believe it.

35:48.356 --> 35:50.358
Emori?

35:52.193 --> 35:55.404
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

36:04.831 --> 36:07.667
- Change your mind?
- Bite me.

36:12.255 --> 36:15.424
Emori, who'd you
steal the boat from?

36:18.427 --> 36:20.847
Told you
he'd come around.

36:37.530 --> 36:41.534
Not so fast.

36:41.742 --> 36:43.202
I say we float him.

36:43.411 --> 36:47.165
Come on. What do you
guys want for it?

36:47.373 --> 36:50.376
One song.
