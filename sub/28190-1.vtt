00:55.222 --> 00:57.265
Aw, hell.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.308
Jake!

01:40.309 --> 01:41.549
What the hell took you so long?

01:43.645 --> 01:45.556
I lost track of time!

02:15.469 --> 02:17.084
Pinche Gringo.

02:19.806 --> 02:23.225
- Who's that?
- General Morales!

02:23.226 --> 02:25.645
- Great.
- We should be getting out of here!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.480
Ah, shit.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.484
- Run to my horse!
- What? Hell, no!

02:31.485 --> 02:32.568
You come and get it!

02:32.569 --> 02:34.362
You selfish son of a bitch!

02:34.363 --> 02:36.822
My horse is right up
at that gate!

02:36.823 --> 02:39.360
I don't know what you're
doing behind that well!

02:43.413 --> 02:47.122
Fine! Cover me!

02:51.672 --> 02:53.673
Whoa, wait, wait.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.674
Don't shoot me.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.893
Andale!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.683
Hyah!

03:53.358 --> 03:55.314
Why won't he quit?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.525
Come on! Hyah! Hyah!

05:09.976 --> 05:11.811
That's it. That's the border.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.770
- That's Texas?
- Yeah.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.599
Come on. Hyah!

05:24.991 --> 05:26.276
Okay.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.997
- We made it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:31.998 --> 05:32.998
Whoa.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.340
He can't do that.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.730
He can't do that!

05:56.731 --> 06:00.401
Come on. Hey! Hyah!

06:00.402 --> 06:01.517
Hyah!

06:12.497 --> 06:13.497
What do you think?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.541
They sure as hell
won't follow us in there.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.582
Yeah, come on.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.721
Whoa.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.854
Here, come here.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.392
Take these.
Tend to these horses.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.755
That man must really hate you.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.883
Me? I just stole his money.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.593
You're the one
that screwed his daughter.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.429
We made love, Jake,
and it was a beautiful thing.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.765
- Try telling him that.
- I will.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.851
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You here for trade?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.603
You'd better get
your men together.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.313
What for?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.234
'Cause the Mexican army
is heading right for you.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.445
To your posts!
To your posts, men!

07:26.446 --> 07:28.572
This is the same shit that got
us run out of fort worth.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.116
That was as much
your fault as it was mine.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.160
Liar! Why can't you once
just find a woman

07:33.161 --> 07:34.161
that doesn't get me shot at?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.902
They're not much fun.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.841
Your move, general.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.464
What the hell is going on here?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.934
These men are fugitives
from Mexico.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.477
I'm here to take them back.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.981
These men are thieves
and cattle rustlers

08:01.982 --> 08:02.982
and should be hung.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.608
That's not true, sir.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.985
All I did was screw
his daughter.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.654
Made love.

08:08.655 --> 08:12.157
Now, hold on one moment.
Who are you?

08:12.158 --> 08:16.787
I am general Morales
of the Mexican army.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.835
Well, general,

08:22.836 --> 08:26.171
I'm colonel Granger of
the United States cavalry,

08:26.172 --> 08:27.673
and I really don't care

08:27.674 --> 08:29.508
if one of these men
screwed your horse.

08:29.509 --> 08:33.011
- But Senior...
- Don't "but Senior” me, general.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.847
You led Mexican soldiers
across the border

08:35.849 --> 08:37.890
into the United States.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.684
That is an act of war.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.062
Now, you turn around immediately

08:42.063 --> 08:44.188
and take your men back to Mexico

08:44.190 --> 08:46.977
or I'll have my men open fire.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.074
I will take the gringos
back with me.

08:54.075 --> 08:58.193
Now, general. Leave now.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.586
If you men ever
come back into Mexico,

09:05.587 --> 09:07.755
you will get dead.

09:21.561 --> 09:26.899
Davy, take four men and make sure
the general crosses the border.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.515
Yes, sir.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.989
Now, for you two.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.034
We didn't mean to start a war.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.704
We'll see about that.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.082
Now, I can't imagine
what you must've done

09:43.083 --> 09:46.043
to make the Mexican army
chase you across the border,

09:46.044 --> 09:48.921
but I'll guess
it was real stupid.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.757
It wasn't the entire army, sir.

09:51.758 --> 09:56.261
Gentlemen, there's only two
kind of men that go to Mexico.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.348
That's cattle rustlers
or fugitives.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.267
We were just there for
an honest card game, sir.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.229
- In Mexico?
- Yes, sir.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.766
To play cards?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.775
Well, I think you two

10:09.776 --> 10:11.276
should stay around here
for a while,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.028
until we sort things out.

10:13.029 --> 10:16.240
Is there a saloon here?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.951
It isn't necessarily
what I would call a saloon,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.369
but there's a place
you can find whiskey.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.870
That'll do.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.791
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

10:25.792 --> 10:28.158
I have things to take care of.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.191
Whoa, hup.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.050
Hup.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.076
Ah, here you are.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.412
Thank you.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.321
Um, excuse me?
Does this town have a name?

13:42.322 --> 13:46.325
I don't think it has a name.
It's a cavalry outpost.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.526
Is there a place I can get
something to eat around here?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.496
See that little shack
over there?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.999
You can get something
resembling a meal.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.334
Why don't you join me?

13:55.335 --> 13:58.086
I'll let you buy me a drink.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.505
- Travis Parker.
- James Andrews.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.091
It's nice to meet you, Jim.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.344
Say, this is a...

14:05.345 --> 14:07.596
Kind of an out of the way place.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.097
What are you doing here?

14:09.098 --> 14:11.391
I'm just passing through
on my way to Arizona.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.394
- Tombstone?
- No, big kill.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.521
Big kill?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.565
- Never heard of it.
- It's a mining town.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.359
They found a mountain
of silver there.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.319
It's been booming ever since.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.436
- Really?
- My brother owns a saloon there.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.901
Really?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.985
Come on. I'll drink to that.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.250
I raise ya.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.887
I call.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.451
Full house.

15:21.045 --> 15:25.590
Three kings? Ha! I win again!

15:25.591 --> 15:27.271
You ain't gonna try
to win your money back?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.273
Jim, this is Jake.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.275
It's a pleasure to meet you.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.109
Likewise.

15:51.367 --> 15:56.288
Jim is on his way
to big kill, Arizona.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.622
Never heard of it.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.958
That's, uh, a mining town.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.574
His brother owns a saloon there.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.464
That so?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.673
I don't know much about it,

16:06.674 --> 16:08.008
except what he told me
in a letter.

16:08.009 --> 16:12.262
It's booming.
Lots of people, saloons...

16:12.263 --> 16:14.055
Even brothels.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.138
That sounds
like my kind of town.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.480
We were... we were planning
on heading that direction.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.231
Perhaps we can ride with you.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.443
Oh, I certainly
wouldn't mind the company.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.652
If you don't mind
me saying, Jim,

16:27.653 --> 16:30.155
I notice you ain't heeled.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.991
I'm sorry?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.577
Means you don't carry a gun.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.409
I don't have any use for one.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.323
Why don't you pick up
a good Colt before we leave?

16:45.379 --> 16:48.465
My talents are
in business, Travis,

16:48.466 --> 16:50.675
not killing.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.011
He doesn't mean
any disrespect, Jim,

16:53.012 --> 16:56.181
but if we're traveling
through this rough territory,

16:56.182 --> 16:59.017
and if big kill
is what you say it is,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.728
it might be a good idea
to have some protection along.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.190
Doesn't mean
you're gonna use it.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.307
Isn't that what
you two gentlemen are for?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.695
Yeah, well, sometimes people

17:11.696 --> 17:13.403
aren't always around
when you need 'em.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.720
- You ready?
- Where's Travis?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.177
Tying up some loose ends.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.560
Amazing. In a place like this,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.728
he's able to find
the only attractive woman.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.480
That guy could fall
into a barrel of dicks

17:45.481 --> 17:47.437
and come up with a tit
in his mouth. Come on!

18:05.835 --> 18:09.421
Mr. Logan, where the hell
do you think you're going?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.256
Arizona.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.465
What's in Arizona?

18:12.466 --> 18:14.342
We're starting a new life.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.428
Is that so?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.636
I thought I told you
I wanted you to stay around.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.310
These men are my guides, sir.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.603
We're going to big kill.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.605
I never heard of it,

18:26.606 --> 18:28.523
but if you're going to
Arizona alone,

18:28.524 --> 18:31.776
I'd be very careful
how I choose my guides.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.614
If we meant you any harm, Jim, we
wouldn't have told you to heel yourself.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.782
Oh, I don't think
they mean you any harm.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.868
Harm just seems
to follow these men.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.661
They've only been here two days

18:41.662 --> 18:44.289
and some of my men
want to kill 'em already.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.126
I don't imagine going to Arizona
is going to change that.

18:48.127 --> 18:52.211
I appreciate your concern, sir,
but I think we'll be okay.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.301
Good luck.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.899
Whoa.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.652
Having trouble
with your horse, Jim?

19:13.653 --> 19:17.612
Can't say I ride too many
horses in Philadelphia.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.340
You'll get used to it. Come on.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.175
Hyah!

19:37.176 --> 19:38.791
Hyah! Ha!

20:49.540 --> 20:51.708
Ha. Ha.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.753
- Up on the Ridge.
- I see 'em.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.590
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.377
We could make
a run for it, but...

21:03.262 --> 21:05.597
Well, we could try west,
but they'd cut us off.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.432
We'd have to go east.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.769
Why do we need to run at all?

21:10.770 --> 21:13.313
It seems like the thing to do.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.646
We don't have to run.
Odds aren't that bad.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.737
You still got that Colt
we told you to buy?

21:20.738 --> 21:23.615
It's in my saddle bag.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.326
It ain't gonna do you
much good in there.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.453
At least look mean.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.945
I don't understand.
We haven't done anything wrong.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.918
Is there something
you're not telling me?

21:34.919 --> 21:36.750
We ain't real liked
in new Mexico.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.805
Well, if it ain't
Jake and Travis.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.807
Howdy, Bob.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.475
I didn't think
you'd be stupid enough

21:50.476 --> 21:52.727
to show your faces
around here again.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.687
You're looking real good, Sam.

21:54.688 --> 21:55.980
Screw you, Travis.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.818
- Reina.
- Jake.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.310
Chisholm's got a bounty
out on you two.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.988
Careful, Bob. Look at the odds.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.499
Gentlemen, ma'am.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.960
We don't want any trouble.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.546
- And who are you?
- Jim Andrews.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.005
I'm an accountant
from Philadelphia

22:21.006 --> 22:22.462
on my way to big kill, Arizona.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.677
Never heard of it.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.512
Well, these men are my guides.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.378
We're just passing through.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.516
Your move, Bob.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.070
Head straight to Arizona.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.739
No side trips.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.659
Especially you.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.870
Don't worry. You have my word.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.540
Mister, I don't know you,

22:55.541 --> 22:56.708
so I don't know your word.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.710
I'm gonna have a man go out

22:58.711 --> 23:01.671
and round up
the rest of this outfit,

23:01.672 --> 23:03.464
just to make sure
your word is good.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.967
Thank you, sir.

23:05.968 --> 23:10.555
Why don't you take your men
from up on top of that Ridge?

23:10.556 --> 23:13.558
I'm not gonna shoot you
in the back, Jake.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.969
Just the same.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.722
Don't ever come back
to new Mexico.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.019
Come on, hup.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.079
An accountant?

23:35.080 --> 23:36.536
Well, I am.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.867
Hup.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.735
There it is.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.612
If this town is
what Jim says it is,

24:49.613 --> 24:51.239
maybe we stay here awhile.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.658
I'm tired of running.

24:53.659 --> 24:57.870
It's time I settled down,
laid down some roots,

24:57.871 --> 25:00.540
become an honorable citizen.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.001
Let's not go that far.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.961
What do you think, Jim?

25:04.962 --> 25:08.047
It'll be good to see my brother.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.879
To big kill.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.702
All right, Jim.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.328
Let's see about
this town of yours.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.661
Come on! Ha!

26:04.063 --> 26:06.054
Ain't much of a Boomtown.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.098
Howdy.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.926
That was rude.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.983
That's it.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.194
The easy lady.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.280
I like the name.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.567
Come on.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.305
This is a nice place.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.975
Is Grant here?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.686
- Who?
- Grant Andrews.

27:26.687 --> 27:30.148
No, I don't know any Grant.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.774
I thought he was the owner.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.986
No, the mayor owns this place.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.727
Told you I don't know any Grant.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.118
Is the mayor around?

27:42.119 --> 27:44.662
Went outta town on business.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.369
Should be back in a few days.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.324
How about whiskey?
You ever heard of that?

27:54.882 --> 27:56.841
You don't look like
the whiskey type.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.676
Says the beer drinker.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.917
Especially this one.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.380
I most definitely
am the whiskey type.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.312
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.144
Guess we're gonna have
to pay for these.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.641
Cover it?

28:19.239 --> 28:21.400
Nope.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.285
Kind of expensive

28:24.286 --> 28:28.831
for such a dead town, isn't it?

28:28.832 --> 28:30.868
Maybe so.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.962
Is there a place to stay
around here?

28:34.963 --> 28:38.883
Yeah, you got a hotel
right down the street.

28:38.884 --> 28:42.220
Should be plenty of rooms...

28:42.221 --> 28:43.836
For all two of you.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.227
How about our horses?
Is there a stable around here?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.764
Round back.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.742
You know, you boys
looking for some work,

29:04.743 --> 29:07.325
you might need to talk
to the preacher.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.868
Must be a religious town.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.933
Come back, now, you hear?

29:38.402 --> 29:42.488
You boys must be new in town.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.116
- We are.
- I'm digger.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.994
I make pine boxes.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.370
I am the last person

29:49.371 --> 29:51.831
who will see
your earthly remains.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.499
How's business?

29:53.500 --> 29:57.413
Been a little too slow
for my liking.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.250
You've been accused
of stealing a horse, Andy.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.593
Now's your opportunity
to repent.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.970
I didn't steal any horse.

30:47.971 --> 30:51.307
The horse was found
on your homestead, son.

30:51.308 --> 30:52.889
I didn't do it.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.538
You'll have a chance
to prove your innocence.

32:26.987 --> 32:31.230
Gentlemen, you must be the
travelers that I heard about.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.119
I'm the preacher.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.906
No shit.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.959
What's your business here?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.075
Just passing through.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.133
Well, you're welcome
to rest up then,

32:49.134 --> 32:50.419
resupply if you need.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.608
Let's go see about that hotel.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.387
Feeling better?

33:35.388 --> 33:38.307
A hot bath does wonders
for the soul.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.718
You boys gonna clean up?

33:41.561 --> 33:43.267
We did.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.149
What's the plan, Jim?

33:47.150 --> 33:49.026
I need to find out
what happened to my brother.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.111
Probably just up and left.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.571
Maybe.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.573
I figure I'll ask
around a little bit.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.700
Shouldn't take too long
to find out where he went.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.370
I don't want to stay here
longer than we have to.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.497
We don't seem very welcome.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.159
We're used to that.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.158
All right.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.545
Let's go.

34:25.563 --> 34:29.567
You boys are back.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.650
Three whiskeys?

34:30.652 --> 34:32.391
And a bottle.

34:36.408 --> 34:40.077
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.496
Yes, I am.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.416
Doesn't it seem odd to you?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.578
All the money being played
in such a dead town?

34:49.337 --> 34:50.543
Looks good to me.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.261
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

34:57.262 --> 34:58.679
I was wondering
if you could help me.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.764
Oh, honey, I'm retired.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.766
But I would love to set you
up with one of my ladies.

35:02.767 --> 35:06.562
No, thank you.
I'm looking for someone.

35:06.563 --> 35:10.274
Maybe you've heard of him.
Grant Andrews?

35:10.275 --> 35:12.484
I don't know anyone named Grant.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.612
He said if
I was ever in big kill,

35:14.613 --> 35:18.115
to come to the easy lady
and ask for him.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.867
Listen, I'd love
to help you, but I...

35:36.843 --> 35:38.458
What the hell was that?

35:54.319 --> 35:56.904
She's perfect for you.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.770
Fred, take care of that.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.915
Is that normal for around here?

36:07.916 --> 36:10.501
Just a situation.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.288
Sometimes these things happen.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.388
I don't think
I caught your name.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.380
Jim.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.686
Jim, you need to talk
to the mayor.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.480
I've heard that.

36:31.481 --> 36:32.981
The mayor will be back
in a couple of days.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.847
He can help you find
what you're looking for.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.543
You boys have been
a little remiss

36:52.544 --> 36:54.378
with your devotions.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.463
See you Sunday?

36:56.464 --> 36:57.631
You, too?

36:57.632 --> 36:59.372
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.345
Yeah, I recognize 'em.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.391
I know you.

37:19.446 --> 37:20.731
That so?

37:22.407 --> 37:24.443
You're Jake and Travis.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.571
Who are you?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.540
Johnny Kane.

37:36.796 --> 37:37.796
Never heard of ya.

37:45.555 --> 37:48.432
Well...

37:48.433 --> 37:51.268
You two have got
quite the reputation.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.384
Thanks.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.731
I hear you're real fast.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.941
I'm just a sporting man.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.728
Yeah?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.781
I was in white oaks.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.908
Two bullets in him before
he ever cleared leather.

38:05.909 --> 38:08.994
I was just lucky.

38:08.995 --> 38:12.289
Personally...

38:12.290 --> 38:14.333
I don't think that man
ever went for his gun.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.416
Well, I guess he should have.

38:20.673 --> 38:21.913
I call.

38:26.012 --> 38:29.807
You two should get
out of town...

38:29.808 --> 38:31.969
Before you draw down
on somebody who shoots back.

38:36.606 --> 38:39.598
- Was that a threat?
- Yeah.

38:40.860 --> 38:44.398
I was just checking.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.701
We're just passing through.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.988
See to it you
pass through quickly.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.841
I'm tired of people
running us out of town.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.958
Yeah. Miss Olivia?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.882
I'm gonna need another drink.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.600
You keep some
interesting company.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.316
I could say the same about you.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.322
Man, you really
sound like our mayor.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.838
I heard there was an incident.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.715
He interrupted my bath.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.753
Oh, no. Can't have that.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.929
Jim?

39:50.930 --> 39:52.598
Allow me the pleasure
to introduce

39:52.599 --> 39:55.934
miss Felicia stiletto.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.675
It's a pleasure.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.520
You have no idea.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.746
Johnny.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.033
Felicia. Beautiful as always.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.878
- Wow. Ahem.
- Praise the lord.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.551
You'll just be passing through.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.014
Good morning.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.471
Morning.

41:21.604 --> 41:24.648
You look nice.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.731
Yeah, I know that outfit.

41:29.153 --> 41:33.657
That man that came up to you
last night, Johnny Kane.

41:33.658 --> 41:34.908
You've never heard of him?

41:34.909 --> 41:37.025
We heard of him.

41:40.039 --> 41:42.541
Is he all talk?

41:42.542 --> 41:45.079
No, he's a killer.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.624
A good one.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.510
Isn't there something
strange about this town?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.968
We just got here and they're
already trying to run us out.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.559
Sounds pretty normal to me.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.687
Jim, we know people like this.

42:03.688 --> 42:07.024
They're bad news.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.234
I'd like to meet this mayor
I've heard about.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.476
He seems to run things.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.700
Looks like the preacher's
running things.

42:16.701 --> 42:19.870
I need answers about my brother.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.827
I don't think the preacher's
the person to ask.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.208
You're right about that.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.258
Come on!

43:17.678 --> 43:20.715
Jake, weren't those
O'Reilly's boys?

43:22.141 --> 43:23.892
Yep.

43:23.893 --> 43:26.269
You know them?

43:26.270 --> 43:27.979
We had a run in
with them up in deadwood.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.275
Shall we have a look around?

43:32.276 --> 43:33.766
Fine idea.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.852
Howdy.

44:06.853 --> 44:08.311
Hi.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.272
Can I help ya?

44:10.273 --> 44:13.316
- Nice store.
- Thank you.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.193
You looking for anything
in particular?

44:15.194 --> 44:18.196
Not sure. I'm new in town.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.531
New to town?

44:19.532 --> 44:21.283
Heh, we don't get that
too often anymore.

44:21.284 --> 44:23.785
Except for the cowboys
who come through here,

44:23.786 --> 44:26.121
but you don't look
like one of them.

44:26.122 --> 44:28.790
No, I'm an accountant.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.917
We definitely don't
get any of them.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.377
Name's Henry strong.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.837
Henry, I'm Jim Andrews,

44:33.838 --> 44:36.006
and these are my friends
Jake and Travis.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.758
Nice to met you, gentlemen.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.624
That's my daughter Josie.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.797
- Ma'am.
- Nice to meet you.

44:48.269 --> 44:50.353
If you don't mind me asking,
Henry, what's...

44:50.354 --> 44:51.813
What's happened
to your town here?

44:51.814 --> 44:54.441
Well, the mines flooded.

44:54.442 --> 44:56.234
No railroad.

44:56.235 --> 44:58.778
Folks pulled up stakes and left.

44:58.779 --> 45:00.155
But you stayed.

45:00.156 --> 45:03.366
Well, I can't leave my store.

45:03.367 --> 45:06.036
My life savings
are tied up in it.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.205
We still have some business
from the ranches in the area,

45:08.206 --> 45:10.999
and those cowboys come through
here a few times a week.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.835
Cowboys, huh?

45:13.836 --> 45:16.963
They don't tell, I don't ask.

45:16.964 --> 45:19.007
They take their cattle
to the slaughterhouse,

45:19.008 --> 45:21.426
come in town,
and spend the money.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.011
What do you do
with all the meat?

45:23.012 --> 45:25.388
It seems like more
than this town needs.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.724
Don't know.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.393
Covered wagons leave there
in the middle of the night.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.937
Ain't my business.

45:31.938 --> 45:33.438
We know what they're doing.

45:33.439 --> 45:37.400
Like I said,
ain't none of our business.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.403
Ours either.
Shall we grace the easy lady?

45:40.404 --> 45:42.239
- Please.
- We met your preacher.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.199
- He's not our preacher.
- Josie.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.409
Our preacher disappeared
the same day he arrived.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.196
That's enough.

45:51.916 --> 45:54.157
Can I interest you
in some of our supplies?

45:55.378 --> 45:58.040
No. Thank you.

46:06.264 --> 46:09.266
- I saw that.
- What?

46:09.267 --> 46:11.935
That look of love
from across the room.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.937
It's a beautiful thing.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.272
I don't think so.

46:15.273 --> 46:20.277
She seems out of place,
that's all.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.779
Join us at the easy lady?

46:22.780 --> 46:25.824
No, I think I'm gonna
walk around a little more.

46:25.825 --> 46:27.406
Well, you know where we'll be.

46:44.176 --> 46:47.009
I'll find a game,
you find some whiskey.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.497
Hey, kid!

47:14.498 --> 47:17.000
What are you doing
way over there? Come on!

47:17.001 --> 47:19.868
We're gonna find you a woman,
teach you some respect!

47:21.380 --> 47:26.509
Come on! Whoo!

47:26.510 --> 47:30.388
We need whiskey and women!

47:30.389 --> 47:34.517
Gimme a bottle. Come on!

47:34.518 --> 47:37.020
Hey, where your whores at?

47:37.021 --> 47:40.357
I need one for the kid
and two for me.

47:40.358 --> 47:45.236
And give the kid
the biggest woman you got.

47:45.237 --> 47:47.197
I want his first experience

47:47.198 --> 47:50.315
to be... special.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.870
Go on, boy, take it down.

47:53.871 --> 47:56.157
Today you become a man.

47:58.376 --> 48:01.493
Whoo! It's good, ain't it?

48:08.594 --> 48:12.180
For Christ's sake.

48:12.181 --> 48:14.933
You give the best table
in the house

48:14.934 --> 48:16.935
to that big buck.

48:16.936 --> 48:20.178
Hey! Boy!

48:21.232 --> 48:22.517
Get outta my seat.

48:26.987 --> 48:29.906
I said...

48:29.907 --> 48:31.574
Get up from that table.

48:43.295 --> 48:44.535
I'm sorry, sir.

48:46.966 --> 48:48.007
Well, that's more like it.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.221
Whoa!

48:58.269 --> 49:00.603
Oh, no, no, no, no!

49:00.604 --> 49:02.272
Who's the boy now, huh?

49:02.273 --> 49:04.264
Who's the boy now?

49:49.361 --> 49:52.071
Son of a bitch!

49:52.072 --> 49:53.687
Where is he?

50:03.667 --> 50:06.374
I hear there's gonna be a fight.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.334
Johnny Kane.

50:13.177 --> 50:14.337
At your service.

50:20.559 --> 50:24.051
This son of a bitch
murdered my friend.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.663
You wanna die along with him?

50:41.664 --> 50:44.040
I don't got a beef
with you, Johnny.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.376
No?

50:46.377 --> 50:49.084
Then drag that stinking
corpse out of this town.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.752
Unless you have
other intentions.

51:00.224 --> 51:02.556
I don't want to fight you.

51:07.398 --> 51:10.515
Nobody ever wants to fight me.

51:33.173 --> 51:35.505
I thought I was gonna get
to kill someone today.

52:31.273 --> 52:32.558
Unh! God!

53:28.205 --> 53:30.912
You have to cock
the hammer, son.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.660
Don't worry, kid.
You won't feel a thing.

54:06.869 --> 54:07.869
Boom.

54:18.005 --> 54:19.839
I don't like him very much.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.502
He seems to be
quite fond of you.

54:34.730 --> 54:35.810
What happened?

54:37.608 --> 54:38.858
Seems the paying customers

54:38.859 --> 54:41.819
decided this isn't
the safest town.

54:41.820 --> 54:43.738
So that leaves Travis and myself

54:43.739 --> 54:47.366
to play cards with each other.

54:47.367 --> 54:48.777
Seven.

54:51.997 --> 54:54.499
Go fish.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.240
No, what happened
with the fight?

54:59.379 --> 55:03.382
One of O'Reilly's boys upset
that very large black man

55:03.383 --> 55:05.802
and it went from there.

55:05.803 --> 55:08.471
You find anything out?

55:08.472 --> 55:11.641
No.

55:11.642 --> 55:14.475
Sit down, Jim. Have a drink.

55:24.488 --> 55:26.989
We've been thinking.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.741
It might be about time
we leave this town.

55:28.742 --> 55:30.451
They kill people
they don't like.

55:30.452 --> 55:31.862
And they don't like us, Jim.

55:33.831 --> 55:35.623
You expect me to leave?

55:35.624 --> 55:37.834
Just forget about my brother?

55:37.835 --> 55:40.586
No, but you can't
do him much good dead.

55:40.587 --> 55:43.840
Just get out of town
for a little while.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.508
Let 'em forget about us.

55:45.509 --> 55:48.845
Maybe find your brother
in the next town.

55:48.846 --> 55:49.846
Maybe you're right.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.082
The mayor's back.

56:47.070 --> 56:49.655
Just trouble with some cowboys.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.115
Trouble?

56:51.116 --> 56:53.075
Tommy and the boys
took care of it. It's okay.

56:53.076 --> 56:55.453
Oh, I can see
how they took care of it.

56:55.454 --> 56:56.787
Where is the preacher?

56:56.788 --> 56:57.788
Thirsty?

57:08.759 --> 57:09.794
Grant?

57:13.972 --> 57:15.837
Jimmy!

57:20.562 --> 57:23.439
- What are you doing here?
- 1 got your letter.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.607
That was two years ago.

57:24.608 --> 57:26.769
I know. Things have been tough.

57:28.612 --> 57:31.447
I heard. I'm sorry.

57:31.448 --> 57:32.733
She was a good woman.

57:33.992 --> 57:36.911
I'm glad you're here.

57:36.912 --> 57:38.868
Grant, what's going on
around here?

57:42.459 --> 57:43.918
These your friends?

57:43.919 --> 57:46.410
Yes, this is Jake and Travis.

57:48.966 --> 57:49.966
Gentlemen.

57:52.928 --> 57:54.043
Y'all hungry?

57:57.891 --> 58:00.643
You're now with me, so anything
you want in this town is yours.

58:00.644 --> 58:04.105
Does that include the saloon?

58:04.106 --> 58:06.518
I did say anything.

58:08.151 --> 58:09.607
Thank you.

58:11.822 --> 58:14.782
I guess they're not hungry.

58:14.783 --> 58:16.444
Shall we take a walk?

58:20.122 --> 58:24.000
I can't believe you're here.
I never heard from you.

58:24.001 --> 58:26.043
I know.

58:26.044 --> 58:27.044
When Kate died, it was...

58:29.798 --> 58:31.998
I decided there was nothing
left for me in Philadelphia.

58:33.844 --> 58:35.960
- So I came out here.
- And here you are.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.720
Here I am.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.853
What you saw today was,
unfortunately,

58:43.854 --> 58:45.640
something that happens
when I'm not around.

58:47.858 --> 58:51.527
You said this place was booming.

58:51.528 --> 58:54.030
You brought me out here to this?

58:54.031 --> 58:56.532
That was two years ago.

58:56.533 --> 58:57.867
Things have changed.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.201
I can see that.

58:59.202 --> 59:02.038
Business was booming.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.826
And then the mines flooded
and people lost everything.

59:06.710 --> 59:09.712
Myself included.

59:09.713 --> 59:12.882
And then someone
walked into my place

59:12.883 --> 59:14.884
and made me an offer
that would save me.

59:14.885 --> 59:17.720
Save you?

59:17.721 --> 59:19.722
- What kind of offer?
- Cattle.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.098
Cattle.

59:21.099 --> 59:24.060
Big kill gets
a steady stream of cattle

59:24.061 --> 59:26.729
that needs to be
disposed of quietly.

59:26.730 --> 59:27.890
Hey.

59:31.151 --> 59:32.687
You're a cattle rustler.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.653
I do not rustle cattle.

59:38.200 --> 59:40.576
We provide a service,

59:40.577 --> 59:43.245
and we make a profit
in that process.

59:43.246 --> 59:46.082
I can't believe
you're involved in this.

59:46.083 --> 59:48.584
They're going to do it anyways.

59:48.585 --> 59:50.586
Jimmy, I know what it is
you're thinking.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.047
I came all the way out here
from Philadelphia.

59:53.048 --> 59:58.928
When I get here, I see people
being gunned down in the streets.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:03.099
And then I come to find out that it's
my own brother who's behind it all.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.975
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.311
Don't you dare
speak to me that way.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:08.979
You were not here
when the town went bust.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.107
You did not have to look
families in their faces

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.525
when they lost everything.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:13.609
You don't know
what that feels like.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.944
It doesn't make it right.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.237
I'm not saying that it's right.

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:17.863
I'm not saying that I like it.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:20.366
I'm saying that I did whatever
I had to do to survive,

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:25.037
to help other families
in this town survive.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.246
Bad things happen, like today.
I don't like it.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.908
But there are good people here.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:38.924
And I have a plan
to turn it all around.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.762
To make us respectable again.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.093
Respectable?

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.942
No, you crossed that line.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:57.987
And you took our good
family name with it.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.188
I am still your older brother.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.790
Forgive me.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.836
I am tired.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.672
And hungry.
And could use a drink.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.715
Please won't you join me?

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:20.676
I'll catch up with you later.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.679
I haven't seen you in years.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.887
The hotel makes
a wonderful lamb.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:28.969
I'm not hungry.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.262
I'm gonna take a walk.

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:36.022
I'll see you there later.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.314
It is good to see you.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.236
I am glad you're here.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.712
Jim.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.423
- Hi.
- Josie.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:01.665
What can I do for you?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.305
I don't know.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.026
This seems like the only
sane place in town.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.576
I've never experienced
violence like this.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.895
How do you get used to it?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.364
I don't.

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.071
I hope I never do.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.247
Can I get you something?
Some water?

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:34.365
No. No, thank you.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.419
Okay.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.876
You don't fit in this town.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.259
Oh, I disagree.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.261
I fit perfectly.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.923
It's the others who don't fit.

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.307
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to insult you.

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:53.769
Oh, you didn't insult me.
No, I know what you meant.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.938
I don't want to bother you.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.898
You're no bother.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.981
You're welcome here
any time, Jim.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:05.232
Have a good afternoon, Josie.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.069
Thank you.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.260
Jackson.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.231
Don't anger him.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.323
Preacher wants to see you.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:50.159
We're busy.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.492
He's expecting you
in the church.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.411
We could use some hail Marys.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.397
Please, come in.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.237
You're all coiled up.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:43.629
Gotta to be calm, boys.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.246
I wouldn't defile
a house of the lord.

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:51.293
Now, you mind removing
your hats in my church?

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.568
There we go.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:09.029
Thank you, gentlemen,
for coming to see me.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:12.074
You're welcome.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.910
This how you live your life?

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:19.325
Just gambling from town to town
until they run you off?

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:24.169
Yeah.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:31.051
Well, I want you two men
in my flock.

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:34.263
And I guarantee your lives

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.266
will be more enriched

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.935
than playing cards.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.479
We like playing cards.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.108
Allow me a retort.

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.444
In your current situation,

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:52.188
I wouldn't be so quick to
decline such a generous offer.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.944
We'll think about it.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.493
Think carefully.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:02.993
Peace be with you.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.927
Preacher.

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.282
I'll take two.

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:37.701
Bet you think you're
such a smart and fancy lad,

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:40.370
and I'll bow to you like milord.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:42.706
But if'n you do,

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:45.000
your head's full of them
sweet tea mice.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.209
I don't know what you said,
but thank you.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.625
I'll take one.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.228
Pick it up.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:06.641
Pick it up!

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:37.129
I call.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.679
You're betting on a blind.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.064
All right, then.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.519
Full house.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.046
Pick it up.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:31.857
A two!

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.740
A two.

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.450
Two?

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.786
You're such a shite card player.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:49.291
Look it, your man can't even
beat a white goat.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.835
You should probably
sit down now.

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:55.380
I don't think so.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.299
I think I'll keep playing.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.301
I need a new horse.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.589
Hey, look at me
while I'm fuckin' ya.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.767
What'd you do that for?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:17.319
Perhaps we should play marbles.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.322
We could play go fish.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.109
Maybe I can win at go fish.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:25.533
Aren't you gonna
do something about it?

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.366
You did laugh at the man.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.169
You two are making fast friends.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.785
You saying you're
our friend, preacher?

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.152
How'd it go?

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:12.659
Successful.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.545
I'm assuming you spoke
into the other ear?

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.832
You won't have any more
trouble in Springville.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.718
You left him alive?

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:25.220
Unfortunately, yes.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.847
I did play with him a little.

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.473
Good.

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:31.181
Better to instill fear
than create a martyr.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:40.527
I need a bath.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:42.359
By all means.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.865
- She does good work.
- Mm.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.706
There's something I got to do.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:36.958
Whoa.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.965
What are you doing here?

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.967
Trying to be graceful.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.345
You're interrupting my bath.

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:51.588
Oh, I can see that.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:27.676
Jimmy.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.091
Have you met our town preacher?

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.028
I have.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:49.364
Quite the man of the cloth.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:53.654
One should administer justice
and offer salvation as well.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:57.497
Justice.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:00.375
Murder.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.544
Depends on how
you see the world.

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:05.630
Well, I see the world
for what it is,

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.299
not what I wish it could be.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.553
Well, I'm glad you two
are becoming fast friends.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:16.057
Not for long. Jim's just passing
through, isn't that right?

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:19.060
Well, I'm hoping that I can get
him to stay a little longer.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:22.147
You know, I have
some friends back east

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.901
that might be very interested
in what's going on around here.

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:28.904
I would tread lightly, son.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:29.905
This ain't the east.

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:39.706
Johnny Kane. Slow movements.

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:41.791
Well, look who grew a sack.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:42.998
Enough.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:56.136
He isn't to be touched.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.095
You're the man, huh?

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:31.132
Let's go again.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.051
I don't think I can.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:34.970
Ooh! Whoa, there.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.589
I said, let's go again.

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:06.203
You can go out
the same way you came in.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:14.965
What in the hell?

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.155
Isn't that the man
from new Mexico?

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:01.741
Yup.

01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:03.159
What's he doing here?

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.570
I do not know.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.628
I will see you later.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.046
Yes, you will.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:16.840
Gentlemen.

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:17.921
Miss Olivia.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:26.808
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.810
How you feeling?

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:32.147
My head hurts.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:33.398
You should eat some eggs.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.651
That will help.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:37.767
Thanks.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.608
You recognize that horse?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.207
No.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.744
Bob Pearson.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.008
If you gentlemen will excuse me,

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:02.677
I have some place to be.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.053
Where you got to be?

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:05.680
Jim's got a girl.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.391
Oh. The saloon.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.351
No.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.687
Josie from the dry goods store.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.314
Oh, hell.

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:16.681
What's that supposed to mean?

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:21.196
That's how it always starts
with this one,

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.906
and then I end up
getting shot at.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:25.116
I don't plan on getting shot at.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.701
Never do.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.158
Almost never.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.820
I'll see you gentlemen later.

01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:39.464
We're gonna get shot at.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.296
Yep.

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:44.292
Can you do this?

01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:49.258
No.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.990
I understand I've been summoned
to the honorable presence

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.784
of our mayor.

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:08.945
Have a seat.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.781
Can I get you a drink? A cigar?

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:23.049
I wanted to make sure
that we were on the same page.

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:24.217
Does that matter?

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:29.764
Well, yes, I think it does.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:32.100
You take care of the order.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.269
I handle the business
side of things.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.062
Thank you for the clarification.

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:38.439
The way you're
taking care of order

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.024
is interfering
with the business.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.527
This is how we do business.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:45.196
Better not be wasting my time
with any more with this.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:48.992
I want to make some changes.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:52.954
- Turn this town around.
- We turned it around.

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.411
I want to make it respectable.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.917
- Respectable?
- Mm.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.800
The meeting with the railroad
people went exceptionally well.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.844
I believe they're gonna
choose us as their town.

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:09.304
Why, you don't say.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.806
Well, we've still got to...

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.808
Deal with Springville.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.184
They keep making
the hard sell, too.

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:16.477
But if we can
get the railroad...

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.309
I wouldn't worry
about Springville.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:22.518
What did you do?

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:25.862
I sent Felicia
to pay a little visit

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:27.196
to their mayor.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:29.438
- Christ.
- Watch your tongue.

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:32.493
This is not
how we get things done.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.995
Oh, to the contrary,

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.956
this is exactly
how we get things done.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:39.500
He's alive, mayor.
Don't worry about that.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.537
You can keep this one
off your little conscience.

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.431
What will it take
for you to stand down?

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.013
I won't.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:58.809
I kneel to only one.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.197
How much?

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:15.534
Wealth is worthless
on the day of the wrath.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.825
Your services
are no longer needed.

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:41.185
Cain Rose up against Abel.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.022
Well, excuse me, mayor.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.364
I have some souls to save.

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:14.595
So what I was saying
is that up in San Francisco,

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.264
we ever make it that far west,

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.474
they got these places
called department stores.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.435
They sell clothes...
Get you new duds,

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.267
you've been in
those clothes for, like...

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.943
Should I be looking
for a fight, Bob?

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.059
I'm not here for you, Jake.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.282
I thought you never
heard about this town.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:38.327
I was just checking
on your... intentions.

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:40.121
And what are yours?

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.539
Business.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.576
There's already enough
to watch out for here.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:47.622
Reckon so.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.508
All right, then.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:53.589
All right.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:06.603
See, Bob could use
himself a new coat.

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:09.272
I always liked Reina.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:13.529
See, what I'm saying is,

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.111
you know, in those
department stores...

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.168
Mr. strong.

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:29.545
Nice flowers.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:30.546
Those for me?

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:33.466
No, they are for Josie.

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:37.178
I thought
you might be coming by.

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.514
We have a house next door.
You can find her there.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:43.017
- Thank you.
- I should probably let you know

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:46.187
that you I keep a shotgun
behind the counter.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:48.144
I'll be keeping
my eye on you, too.

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:51.978
- I would expect so.
- Go on.

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:56.236
And, Jim, call me Henry.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:23:59.033
Okay, Henry.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:23.140
- Oh, hi, Jim.
- Hi.

01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:25.059
I'm sorry to barge in
on you like this.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.395
No, it's okay.
I was just cleaning up.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.063
I don't mean to bother you.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:31.566
I... I just wanted to
give you these.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:34.735
Oh, that is so sweet. Thank you.

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:39.407
I can't tell you the last time
someone brought me flowers.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:43.411
Well, I don't know how often
you get to smile in this town.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:47.331
I thought they might
make you smile.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:49.197
They are lovely. Thank you.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:52.587
I'll leave you.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:56.757
Um, Josie...

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:59.176
I have to ask,

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:00.713
why are you here?

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.049
Where else would I go?

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:07.633
Anywhere.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:14.108
When my mother died,
my father refused to give up.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:15.776
I came back here to help.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:19.780
I couldn't leave him here alone.

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:22.199
No, of course not.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.286
He has everything in this place,

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:26.287
including her.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.460
The town isn't bad,

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.746
just some of the people.

01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:41.802
Well, enjoy the flowers.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.259
I will. Thank you.

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:46.557
Jim...

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:49.675
Can I take you some place later?

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:54.480
Yes. I'd like that.

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:57.106
Okay.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.272
Crap!

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.177
Gentlemen.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.846
May I ask what happened to you?

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.805
I do believe that I have
found the woman of my dreams.

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:34.188
I've heard this before.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.773
Jim, how's the new girlfriend?

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:39.193
- What new girlfriend?
- Jim is sweet on that

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.362
cute little redhead down
at the dry goods store.

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:43.364
Josie.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.366
Bought her flowers
and everything.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:46.867
Yeah, she is a great girl.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.411
You two would make
a fine couple.

01:26:48.412 --> 01:26:50.494
I never said anything
about being a couple.

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:52.832
I like talking to her.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:54.875
See there?

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.377
All the more reason
for you to stay.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:58.838
What you said the other day,

01:26:58.839 --> 01:27:00.464
do you really think
you can fix this town?

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:03.300
I know I can.

01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:06.470
I've been talking to people
from the railroad.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:08.055
Railroad?

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.682
They don't have a line
that runs through this region.

01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:11.726
Now we've made a lot of money,
and I plan on offsetting

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:12.977
the cost of their track.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:15.312
I think they're gonna say yes.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:17.523
And now that you're here,

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:18.855
we can do it together.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.946
And you boys, well,
you're welcome to stay

01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:27.241
and see the rebirth
of this town, hmm?

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.527
Much obliged. «- mm-hmm.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:30.911
What about the preacher?

01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:36.703
Well, I am sure that we can
work something out.

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:42.548
The future.

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:43.789
The future.

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:49.211
- Ah, man.
- Howdy, Jake.

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.393
You care to join me?

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:57.438
Gentlemen, uh,

01:27:57.439 --> 01:28:00.357
miss Olivia needs my...
Needs my attention.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:01.567
Hmm.

01:28:01.568 --> 01:28:03.559
- We should go now, sir.
- Hmm.

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.621
You boys enjoy
the rest of the day.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:16.238
- I know that Jake will.
- Cowboy.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.934
Nobody runs me out of my town.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.413
It's beautiful.

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:58.450
Yes, it is.

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:05.756
What brings you
all the way out to big kill?

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:08.965
- My brother.
- Besides that.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:13.931
I had nowhere else to go.

01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:15.468
I lost my wife in childbirth.

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:22.805
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.688
To my surprise,
the sun still rises and sets.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:36.871
I came out of a fog

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:39.915
and I realized I was

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:41.656
already on my way here.

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.504
So this is it?

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:48.799
This is your final destination?

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.093
I find that hard to believe.

01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:53.053
Why is that?

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:55.556
You're a big city person.

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:57.013
This is not a big city.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:03.606
You may not know me
as well as you think.

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:05.733
There could be things
that keep me around.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:07.520
What kind of things?

01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:11.694
The sunset's pretty nice.

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:14.690
Just the sunset, huh?

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:19.862
No.

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:57.858
This is not what I wanted.

01:31:00.038 --> 01:31:02.039
But betrayal...

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.701
Is a sin.

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.799
Look at me.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:15.594
This is gonna hurt, mayor.

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:16.926
This is gonna hurt bad now.

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.485
Hold on.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:33.654
Please. Please don't do this.

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:35.781
Show the mayor around town.

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:39.824
Yah!

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:27.993
Why? Why did you challenge me?

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:31.045
You're not a bad man.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:34.214
You're not a bad man.
You're just weak.

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:37.673
And the meek shall not
inherit the earth in my town.

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:41.924
String him up.

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:57.227
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:35.943
The view was amazing. Thank you.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.229
Yes, it was.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:49.957
Even in a town like this,
there's beauty somewhere.

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:52.040
I knew that
the first time I saw you.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.967
Well, I better be getting back.

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:02.010
Have a good night, Josie.

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:03.126
Good night, Jim.

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:34.918
Grant!

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.712
Grant, no!

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:37.963
Help!

01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:42.176
- Help!
- Shit.

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:44.761
- Help!
- Oh!

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.813
Hey, give him to me.

01:34:54.814 --> 01:34:58.807
Cut him down!
Get her out of here.

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:04.740
No! No!

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:10.454
Get her out of here, come on!

01:35:10.455 --> 01:35:13.207
Get up!

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.293
- Get up! Get up!
- Get out of here!

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.714
- Come on, we're sitting ducks!
- Come on, Jim! Come on.

01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:22.132
- Come on, Jim!
- Jim, come on, we got to go.

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:23.717
Come on, Jim! Come on, come on!

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:26.220
- I got him.
- Come on!

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:27.961
Go! Jim!

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:31.433
- Come on.
- Henry! Let's go!

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:33.265
I will take care of him.

01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:37.981
It's okay.

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:39.188
It's my job.

01:35:57.794 --> 01:36:00.295
You pacing around
is making me nervous.

01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:02.787
Good. You know how I feel.

01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:06.343
I don't like being in here.

01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:08.175
It's like... like a duck trap.

01:36:14.018 --> 01:36:16.937
We'll bury your brother
at daybreak.

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:19.398
Then we'll ride
out of here like hell.

01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:21.775
Make sure you get
something to eat, Jim.

01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:24.278
There's not gonna be any time
after the burial.

01:36:24.279 --> 01:36:25.799
We're gonna ride hard
to the next town.

01:36:28.324 --> 01:36:30.189
You sure you need more?

01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:37.910
It's cold.

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:41.461
If it's clear, I'm gonna...

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:42.793
I'm gonna check on digger.

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:54.965
How the hell
did you get in here?

01:36:56.978 --> 01:36:59.187
I ain't here to fight.

01:36:59.188 --> 01:37:01.023
Then why'd you come?

01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:02.983
To tell you I don't agree

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:04.985
with that was done
to your brother.

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:06.101
It wasn't right.

01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:10.115
Thank you.

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:12.159
I can help you get out of town,

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.776
but we must leave now.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:21.460
You work for the preacher.

01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:24.004
Why don't I kill you right now?

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:28.216
I work for him,
but I ain't no butcher.

01:37:28.217 --> 01:37:29.798
I still have honor.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.091
All right.

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:41.188
What the hell's he doing here?

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:43.357
I'm not here as your enemy.

01:37:43.358 --> 01:37:45.895
Well, you as sure hell
ain't a friend.

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:50.030
Please hurry.

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:51.365
They'll be coming for you soon.

01:37:53.159 --> 01:37:55.070
And I'm sorry.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:03.958
What'd you find out?

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:08.548
Digger will be by at daybreak.

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:09.669
We'll take him to boot hill.

01:38:11.928 --> 01:38:12.928
You trust him?

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:18.183
No. No, I don't.

01:38:18.184 --> 01:38:19.393
I told him
if I smell a crawfish,

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:20.509
I'd shoot him on sight.

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:25.434
So we wait.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:30.904
We'll stay with you...

01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:32.270

Jake, we're riding out of here.

I suggest you do the same.

01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:40.742
With the mayor gone,

01:40:40.743 --> 01:40:44.037
this place is gonna
get dangerous real fast.

01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:45.497
You can pass through new Mexico.

01:40:45.498 --> 01:40:48.581
- I won't stop you.
- Thanks, Bob.

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.043
Just in case you need it.

01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:59.177
Thanks.

01:40:59.178 --> 01:41:01.138
Get it back to me when you
get back to new Mexico.

01:41:03.391 --> 01:41:05.517
You boys watch your backs.

01:41:05.518 --> 01:41:08.510
Let's go. Hyah!

01:41:22.285 --> 01:41:23.410
What do you think?

01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:25.527
I think they're coming for us.

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:31.334
Me, too.

01:41:37.258 --> 01:41:39.259
I'll check the horses.
Get him ready to ride.

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.260
1 will.

01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:11.124
Jesus, Jim, couldn't
you get a bigger gun?

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:14.461
If I'm lucky enough
to hit someone,

01:42:14.462 --> 01:42:16.168
I want it to count.

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:20.800
They're coming for us.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.133
We got to get out of here.

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:31.517
You're not going
anywhere, are you?

01:42:37.568 --> 01:42:39.684
They're gonna kill you, Jim.

01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:44.773
I know.

01:42:57.338 --> 01:42:58.578
Horses are ready.

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:03.416
Jim, that can't be all we have.

01:43:05.388 --> 01:43:07.222
You said we might
run into trouble.

01:43:07.223 --> 01:43:09.339
I was right.

01:43:10.476 --> 01:43:11.726
There's no sign of 'em.

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:15.188
We can get away clean
if we go now.

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:17.180
I'm not going.

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:19.859
What?

01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:25.907
Jim...

01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:28.868
You stay here, they'll kill you.

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:30.575
I know.

01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:38.247
I can't talk you
out of this, can I?

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.495
No.

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:54.561
Let me guess.

01:43:54.562 --> 01:43:57.349
I'm staying here with Jim.

01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:12.620
Well, good luck.

01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:15.248
- Fine.
- Fine!

01:44:15.249 --> 01:44:18.752
I'm tired of getting run out
of every town we go to.

01:44:18.753 --> 01:44:21.421
People running us off like dogs.

01:44:21.422 --> 01:44:23.923
So you wanna pick this shithole
to make your stand?

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:25.842
- That's right.
- That's just great.

01:44:25.843 --> 01:44:27.427
We're always running away.

01:44:27.428 --> 01:44:29.304
And notice we're still alive.

01:44:29.305 --> 01:44:31.306
It's time to make
a stand for something,

01:44:31.307 --> 01:44:33.433
and I'm making that stand
here with Jim.

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:35.345
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:38.271
He's gonna get killed
without us.

01:44:38.272 --> 01:44:40.315
He's gonna get killed with us!

01:44:40.316 --> 01:44:41.691
Why do we have to
go down with him?

01:44:41.692 --> 01:44:43.151
Because it's
the right thing to do!

01:44:43.152 --> 01:44:44.402
Oh, to hell with
the right thing to do.

01:44:44.403 --> 01:44:45.803
The right thing
to do is stay alive!

01:44:47.865 --> 01:44:48.900
He's our friend.

01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:03.251
You're gonna die with him.

01:46:15.703 --> 01:46:16.703
What now?

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:22.326
We wait.

01:46:57.578 --> 01:46:58.863
What took you so long?

01:47:01.624 --> 01:47:02.864
I lost track of time.

01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:10.087
Why the hell do you care about
what happens to this town?

01:47:14.136 --> 01:47:16.047
I want to finish
what my brother started.

01:47:18.933 --> 01:47:20.389
He's all I had left.

01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:29.609
Then let's take
the fight to them.

01:47:38.661 --> 01:47:40.620
Here.

01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:42.077
It's hard to miss with this.

01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:49.629
I'd like to pay a visit
to the slaughterhouse.

01:48:10.859 --> 01:48:12.599
Everybody get out!

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:24.580
What the hell is going on?

01:48:24.581 --> 01:48:26.947
You better have a damn
good reason for being here.

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:32.958
I said get out.

01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:43.182
If you're gonna point that
at someone,

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:44.969
make sure you can
pull the trigger.

01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:48.515
Burn it.

01:49:23.057 --> 01:49:24.057
Finish this, Johnny.

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:23.783
When the shooting starts,

01:50:23.784 --> 01:50:26.285
empty both barrels
into the nearest man

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:28.117
and get the hell away.

01:51:02.406 --> 01:51:06.240
I thought you would be
halfway to Mexico by now.

01:51:07.744 --> 01:51:10.156
We didn't have
much luck in Mexico.

01:51:16.003 --> 01:51:17.203
You don't have much luck here.

01:51:31.894 --> 01:51:33.976
Suppose not.

01:51:36.315 --> 01:51:40.026
It's your move, Johnny Kane.

01:54:31.865 --> 01:54:33.491
What'd you do that for?

01:54:33.492 --> 01:54:35.534
I can't help it. It's who I am.

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:37.370
What?

01:54:37.371 --> 01:54:39.205
Oh, baby.

01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:41.993
It's just a little rough love.

01:55:30.006 --> 01:55:31.496
You got grit, Jim.

01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:38.879
I'll give you that.

01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.891
Your services
are no longer needed.

01:55:46.481 --> 01:55:48.221
I heard that before.

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:53.522
Any last confessions?

01:55:57.993 --> 01:55:59.073
No.

01:56:01.288 --> 01:56:02.528
My soul's at peace.

01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:05.906
Is yours?

01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:12.480
Shoot him!

01:57:14.236 --> 01:57:16.237
Shoot him with...

01:57:16.238 --> 01:57:18.113
The gun under your skirt
I gave you.

01:57:18.114 --> 01:57:19.229
Shoot him.

01:57:26.623 --> 01:57:27.988
Lin-wah.

01:57:30.585 --> 01:57:31.745
Lin-wah?

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:45.319
The hell happened to you?

01:58:48.622 --> 01:58:51.123
She stabbed me, Jake.

01:58:51.124 --> 01:58:53.626
I think you'd be
used to that by now.

01:58:53.627 --> 01:58:56.295
- Just get it out.
- All right.

01:58:56.296 --> 01:58:57.463
That hurt?

01:58:57.464 --> 01:59:01.133
Shut up and do it.

01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:02.384
On three.

01:59:02.385 --> 01:59:05.471
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:59:05.472 --> 01:59:08.807
One...

01:59:08.808 --> 01:59:10.517
Ow.

01:59:10.518 --> 01:59:11.598
Keepsake.

01:59:14.648 --> 01:59:16.434
He killed the preacher.

01:59:17.692 --> 01:59:20.274
How the hell did he do that?

01:59:21.404 --> 01:59:23.322
I don't know.

01:59:23.323 --> 01:59:26.325
Probably the same way we've
been alive all these years.

01:59:26.326 --> 01:59:31.705
- Just lucky, I guess.
- Let's get a drink.

01:59:31.706 --> 01:59:33.332
I guess it's on
the house, right?

01:59:33.333 --> 01:59:34.448
Yeah.

02:00:02.612 --> 02:00:05.280
Where's Jake?

02:00:05.281 --> 02:00:07.613
Tying up some loose ends.

02:00:12.205 --> 02:00:14.491
I'm gonna miss you.

02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:18.829
Thanks.

02:00:25.552 --> 02:00:27.292
Saying good-bye?

02:00:28.555 --> 02:00:30.222
Gonna be a long ride.

02:00:30.223 --> 02:00:32.259
- Sure was.
- Three whiskeys.

02:00:34.227 --> 02:00:36.603
I thought you two wanted
to settle down some place.

02:00:36.604 --> 02:00:38.814
All this got me thinking
about my own brother.

02:00:38.815 --> 02:00:40.357
Thought I better check in.

02:00:40.358 --> 02:00:42.901
Besides,
we better get out of here

02:00:42.902 --> 02:00:44.642
before you get yourself
a real preacher.

02:00:46.239 --> 02:00:48.365
Turn this into
a respectable town, right?

02:00:48.366 --> 02:00:50.242
Well, that's the plan.

02:00:50.243 --> 02:00:51.910
There may be others out there.

02:00:51.911 --> 02:00:54.246
I'll take care of them. Legally.

02:00:54.247 --> 02:00:56.373
I still have friends back east.

02:00:56.374 --> 02:00:58.706
You have friends out here, too.

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.331
Thank you.

02:01:05.425 --> 02:01:06.967
You're always welcome here.

02:01:06.968 --> 02:01:09.209
Friends.

02:01:15.727 --> 02:01:20.439
You really think
this town is gonna survive?

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.940
I got in touch
with the railroad.

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:23.781
They're gonna come here
and take a look around.

02:01:24.903 --> 02:01:26.643
I think we'll be all right.

02:01:35.789 --> 02:01:38.246
Yeah, I think
you'll be just fine.

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:43.292
Thank you for everything.

02:01:44.798 --> 02:01:46.423
Miss Josie.

02:01:46.424 --> 02:01:47.755
Came to say good-bye.

02:01:50.970 --> 02:01:53.430
You take care of Jim now.

02:01:53.431 --> 02:01:55.763
- I will.
- He's a wild one.

02:02:02.982 --> 02:02:04.858
You two try
to stay out of trouble.

02:02:04.859 --> 02:02:08.487
- We always try to.
- Jim?

02:02:08.488 --> 02:02:10.405
You gonna run the saloon now?

02:02:10.406 --> 02:02:12.658
No.

02:02:12.659 --> 02:02:14.910
The madam's gonna run it.

02:02:14.911 --> 02:02:16.526
I'm thinking
about running for mayor.

02:02:18.498 --> 02:02:20.332
You know there's
gonna be more trouble.

02:02:20.333 --> 02:02:22.668
I suspect.

02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:24.586
You're gonna need
some help with that.

02:02:24.587 --> 02:02:26.543
I suspect.

02:02:28.842 --> 02:02:30.050
Hopefully you can find some.

02:02:30.051 --> 02:02:32.052
Yes.

02:02:32.053 --> 02:02:33.668
We'll be around.

02:02:35.849 --> 02:02:38.433
Miss Olivia. Henry.

02:02:38.434 --> 02:02:40.435
You boys take care.

02:02:40.436 --> 02:02:42.604
Hup!

02:02:42.605 --> 02:02:44.812
Hyah! Hyah!
