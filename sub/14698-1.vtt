WEBVTT

01:34.028 --> 01:36.396
<i>We live in the new time.</i>

01:36.397 --> 01:41.359
<i>The year is 41, and the Protectorate
controls all the water on Earth,</i>

01:41.836 --> 01:45.137
<i>and therefore, all life.</i>

01:45.306 --> 01:48.475
<i>I am the Warden of Orphanage 43,</i>

01:48.476 --> 01:51.401
<i>one of the many orphanages
that border the wasteland.</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:57.909
<i>Children are brought here at an early age
to be indoctrinated to serve The System.</i>

01:58.452 --> 02:00.887
<i>It hurts me to do what I do.</i>

02:00.888 --> 02:03.756
<i>I, too, must serve The System.</i>

02:04.992 --> 02:09.628
<i>Sometimes in my dreams,
I see the Earth as it was before,</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:13.900
<i>green, with flowing
rivers and mighty oceans.</i>

02:13.901 --> 02:16.132
<i>Can it ever be like that again?</i>

02:17.238 --> 02:21.574
<i>There is a legend,
a tale told by the Tchiganis,</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:24.500
<i>that speaks of a visitor
that came from the heavens.</i>

02:25.446 --> 02:28.448
<i>The people called it Bodhi.</i>

02:28.449 --> 02:33.786
<i>The legend says that it has come to
Earth to free the waters once again.</i>

02:34.221 --> 02:38.387
<i>Is this legend true? Who knows?</i>

04:55.095 --> 04:57.664
- We challenge.
- And we accept.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.966
- By the rules.
- Sure.

05:01.101 --> 05:05.405
You want it by the rules?
Then let it be squared fair.

05:44.078 --> 05:47.208
- All right, let's go!
- Lead off!

05:48.082 --> 05:49.482
Okay, go! Go! Go!

05:49.483 --> 05:50.583
Pick it up! Pick it up!

05:50.584 --> 05:51.651
Go, Charles!

05:51.652 --> 05:53.280
Right now! Hit it up!

05:54.355 --> 05:58.316
- Watch out! It's clear!
- Pound him, Jason!

05:59.026 --> 06:02.028
- Hey, Jason, look out! He's behind you!
- Watch your back!

06:04.098 --> 06:07.990
- Violation!
- Who saw it? I didn't.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.772
Okay, then. No rules!

06:19.313 --> 06:22.148
He's open! He's open!
Crunch him! Crunch him!

06:22.149 --> 06:25.017
Stop Gavial! Get him!

06:27.287 --> 06:29.018
Damn!

06:30.357 --> 06:32.458
Free ball! Free ball!

06:32.459 --> 06:34.520
Jason! Jason!

06:35.996 --> 06:37.797
- Skate, Petey!
- Jason!

06:37.798 --> 06:40.900
- Jason! Over here!
- Get the ball!

06:40.901 --> 06:42.568
- Watch his legs!
- Move it!

06:42.569 --> 06:44.404
Come on, Metron, you're in the clear!

06:44.405 --> 06:46.472
Go for it! All right!

06:47.775 --> 06:49.776
You got it!

06:49.777 --> 06:53.379
- Break left, Jason!
- Come on, defense!

06:53.380 --> 06:56.681
Gavial! Come on, Gavial!

06:58.352 --> 07:01.380
- Come on, Terra!
- Jason!

07:02.222 --> 07:04.991
- Nice speed! Nice speed!
- Come on, Jason!

07:07.361 --> 07:09.023
Damn!

07:10.764 --> 07:14.361
Go! Go, get them! Skate!

07:17.438 --> 07:19.999
- Come on, keep it tight.
- Quick, over here!

07:27.548 --> 07:31.145
Scramble! E-Cops!

07:31.718 --> 07:33.219
<i>This is E-Police.</i>

07:33.220 --> 07:34.520
- Come on!
- Let's go!

07:34.521 --> 07:36.689
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Move it!

07:36.690 --> 07:37.957
Let's accelerate!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.849
<i>You are in orphanage
perimeter violation.</i>

07:42.262 --> 07:47.292
<i>You are surrounded. Hold for
immediate restraining action.</i>

07:47.501 --> 07:49.702
<i>You are warned, perimeter violators.</i>

07:49.703 --> 07:51.370
Scatter! Use the cave!

07:51.371 --> 07:54.106
<i>Stun weapons have been authorized.</i>

07:55.876 --> 07:58.744
<i>You are warned and
reordered to hold positions.</i>

07:58.745 --> 08:01.180
Tug, watch out!

08:01.181 --> 08:03.516
Skate! Come on!

08:13.927 --> 08:15.127
Gavial!

08:15.128 --> 08:19.328
<i>You are warned and
reordered to hold position.</i>

08:20.734 --> 08:23.261
<i>You are surrounded.</i>

08:29.743 --> 08:31.906
Scorpions.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.811
You have had special
treatment, favors,

08:38.118 --> 08:41.254
training by experts
from my maiming squads.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.856
- Do you deny that?
- No, Strictor Grock.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.893
And yet you allow
yourselves to be trashed

08:46.894 --> 08:50.563
by left-brain rollers
using homemade gear?

08:50.564 --> 08:51.898
Strictor, if we just had...

08:51.899 --> 08:55.894
Cut your breath before you
betray your putrid thinking!

08:56.703 --> 08:58.730
Scorpions.

09:00.841 --> 09:04.972
Without me, you're nothing,
you don't exist.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.215
You're an extension of me.

09:09.216 --> 09:13.814
If you are defeated then I am
defeated, and that cannot be.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.723
<i>- Where'd he go?
- Down one of the mine shafts.</i>

09:17.724 --> 09:19.125
<i>Forget about him.</i>

11:30.090 --> 11:32.185
I can hear.

11:34.428 --> 11:38.286
You did it. You fixed my ears.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.029
Thank you.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.496
What's your name?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.300
Bo...

11:49.476 --> 11:52.902
Bo... d... hi?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.045
Bodhi!

11:58.952 --> 12:00.876
Bodhi!

12:03.256 --> 12:05.681
I can hear!

12:06.927 --> 12:10.524
I can really hear!

12:20.841 --> 12:24.043
Where's Daniel?
He always beats us back.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.012
- Well, what if they caught him?
- Not a chance!

12:27.013 --> 12:29.506
Let's move or we'll miss roll check.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.987
- Come on!
<i>- First call. First call.</i>

12:34.988 --> 12:38.724
<i>Water privileges will be announced
at free schedule assembly.</i>

12:40.293 --> 12:44.094
- Come on!
<i>- Fall in. Fall in!</i>

12:46.366 --> 12:49.068
<i>Dorm unit commanders,
start your head count.</i>

12:49.069 --> 12:51.103
<i>Staffers, ready your group.</i>

12:51.104 --> 12:52.538
Where's Daniel?

12:52.539 --> 12:54.702
<i>- Unit 12.</i>
- I don't know!

12:55.942 --> 12:58.310
<i>Hurry it up, unit 12!</i>

12:59.279 --> 13:01.146
<i>Unit seven!</i>

13:03.717 --> 13:05.516
<i>Unit four.</i>

13:08.722 --> 13:10.612
<i>Unit eight.</i>

13:14.161 --> 13:16.119
<i>Unit nine.</i>

13:20.433 --> 13:25.065
You better be quiet now.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

13:32.746 --> 13:37.048
Do you like air?
I mean, do you breathe?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.386
Uh-oh.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.620
Well, better not take a chance.

13:44.024 --> 13:48.724
<i>The following units are scheduled
for water privileges. Unit three.</i>

13:49.763 --> 13:51.497
<i>Unit six.</i>

13:51.498 --> 13:53.098
- Hey! Hey!
<i>- Unit 12.</i>

13:53.099 --> 13:56.024
<i>Water privileges denied.</i>

13:57.137 --> 13:59.772
<i>Remember, behavior
determines existence...</i>

13:59.773 --> 14:01.902
Get back, get back!

14:05.812 --> 14:08.547
<i>Programming assembly has been called.</i>

14:08.548 --> 14:12.714
<i>Appear with enthusiasm for
programming assembly.</i>

14:32.772 --> 14:35.106
It's my drinking ration.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.271
You like it here.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.583
It's quiet.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.453
That's the difference between us.
I don't like quiet.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.947
Yes, I know.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.859
Why do you let them
go beyond the walls?

14:53.860 --> 14:55.594
It's good for morale.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.864
It lets them feel they're
getting away with something.

14:58.865 --> 15:02.860
And after all, there is
no chance of escape.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.337
The nearest uncontrolled
water is 100 miles away.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.607
- I want them punished for it.
- All of them?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.374
I saw only Solarbabies.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.242
Were they winning?

15:18.952 --> 15:22.221
Odd name for a skateball
team, don't you think?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.214
"Solarbabies."

15:24.624 --> 15:27.857
Soft. No menace.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.395
Why do you suppose they chose it?

15:29.396 --> 15:33.459
They don't seem to need anything
more menacing, do they?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.161
They always seem to win.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.808
But you needn't worry.
They'll be properly punished.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.493
They called themselves
"Eco-warriors."

16:01.494 --> 16:03.555
"Eco," taken from what?

16:05.031 --> 16:06.598
Rabbit?

16:06.599 --> 16:09.735
Hey, if they took it,
they should give it back.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.138
<i>Tutor Nover,</i>

16:13.139 --> 16:17.276
<i>I would like to see Jason,
Metron, Rabbit, Terra and Tug</i>

16:17.277 --> 16:18.477
<i>on the dog block immediately.</i>

16:18.478 --> 16:21.278
- Looks like trouble.
- Busted.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.584
Sundown for the Solarbabies!

16:32.359 --> 16:34.660
This orphanage is dedicated

16:34.661 --> 16:38.497
to producing useful members
of the E-Protectorate.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.362
I will not run it as a prison.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.705
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.975
Yes. Then why did I have a Strictor

16:49.976 --> 16:52.544
from the E-Police Maiming Squad
in my office this morning?

16:52.545 --> 16:56.348
- We were challenged by the Scorpions.
- I'm sure you were.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.411
But you could have taken the
challenge here in organized play.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.554
- They wanted the outside arena.
- Of course they did.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.752
There are no rules at the arena.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.019
Now understand something.

17:08.595 --> 17:13.954
My power ends at the walls.
Outside, it's the Strictors' world.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.826
There is nothing out there. Nothing.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.406
Stick with us.

17:21.407 --> 17:26.369
Learn to serve order and
you'll achieve a decent lifegrid.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.051
- Let them do 10 cubic meters.
- What?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.612
Ten?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.749
Let them do 20 cubic meters.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.032
Hurry up! Come on, let's go!

17:48.401 --> 17:50.436
All right, it's a good game!

17:51.504 --> 17:53.439
All right. Come on! It's my roll.

17:57.410 --> 18:02.147
Twenty cubic meters by sundown
or double that tomorrow.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.072
Start digging!

18:14.194 --> 18:17.722
- What is that?
- What's that supposed to be?

18:39.486 --> 18:43.754
Hey, crowbrains! No birds allowed.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.329
You got a problem, Darstar?

18:57.070 --> 18:59.165
Bye-bye, Mr. Magic.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.473
The guy's a total moon.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.294
Terra!

19:25.532 --> 19:29.735
- I like the sweat.
- Get out, you creature of filth!

19:29.736 --> 19:32.771
Hey, I just wanna talk.

19:32.772 --> 19:37.404
Maybe just a little hands-on parley?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.814
Now I'm listening.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.740
Gavial! Get out of there!

19:50.323 --> 19:52.190
Next time.

20:02.702 --> 20:07.439
Well, little Stakker, they
gave us 20 cubes in the ditch.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.901
Yes, there's times when it
pays to be just a mascot.

20:11.978 --> 20:15.681
- Forget it. He's not wearing his ears.
- When's the next water privilege?

20:15.682 --> 20:17.749
How long do I gotta wear this scuzz?

20:17.750 --> 20:21.153
You're gonna have us holding our
noses for the next two days.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.489
Unless we had a rainstorm.

20:24.490 --> 20:28.093
Sure, well, how about a hurricane
or a flood while you're at it?

20:28.094 --> 20:30.662
You believe all that dog
squeeze they feed us in class?

20:30.663 --> 20:33.224
That's not the way it was.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.924
Here's how it used to be.

20:38.471 --> 20:41.907
"Thunder rolls distant
across the sky,

20:41.908 --> 20:44.943
"in echo to pale
flashes of lightning.

20:44.944 --> 20:48.013
"The vast cloudscape thickens.

20:48.014 --> 20:52.284
"The scent of purest water
hangs in the air to be savored,

20:52.285 --> 20:55.988
"before the first large
warm drops fall.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.790
"Then, within seconds,
the air is no more,

20:58.791 --> 21:02.957
"replaced by a vertical
curtain of falling rain.

21:03.630 --> 21:07.056
"The land drinks and the
earth is refreshed."

21:07.533 --> 21:12.271
Could you imagine to see clouds
and feel rain falling from the sky?

21:12.272 --> 21:16.575
One of the few good things the
Protectorate ever did was outlaw fiction.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.511
- Where'd you get this?
- Never mind! Just give it back!

21:19.512 --> 21:23.749
Well, before you get so over-amped
over these pseudo-factoids, I'd...

21:30.323 --> 21:33.258
- I didn't just hear that, I felt it.
- What was it?

21:33.259 --> 21:35.494
Well, let's hope it's not
another earth shift.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.231
It's water!

21:48.941 --> 21:50.706
Yeah.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.045
Hey! Here!

21:53.046 --> 21:54.606
Hey, it's water!

21:55.948 --> 21:57.872
It's water!

22:00.486 --> 22:02.183
I don't believe this.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.461
- Terra!
- Hey, Terra! Come on, come on!

22:11.364 --> 22:14.028
- Come here, get over here!
- It's wet!

22:14.133 --> 22:15.367
Enjoy it!

22:15.368 --> 22:18.532
- Come on, Dan!
- Daniel, come on! Come on!

22:18.771 --> 22:21.366
Let's go, little man!

22:22.742 --> 22:26.634
Take that! Hey, go, little man! Go!

22:30.216 --> 22:32.951
Yeah! All right!

22:44.263 --> 22:46.130
Meds.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.734
They must be slipping us
some kind of new medication.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.901
We're all hallucinating.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.937
Well, they can slip me
more of that anytime.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.572
I'm clean!

22:54.874 --> 22:59.478
- It wasn't meds. It was real.
- No, it couldn't have been real.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.540
No, it was.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.983
- He can hear you!
- What?

23:04.984 --> 23:07.786
Of course he heard me.
He hears everything.

23:07.787 --> 23:11.423
- No, you heard me. You can hear.
- Yeah, I can hear.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.625
Daniel, you can hear
without your electric ears!

23:13.626 --> 23:17.129
My electric ears don't even work.
I hear everything.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.931
- That's impossible.
- Hey, man, how can you say that?

23:19.932 --> 23:24.469
It's been thundering and lightning,
and we're all soaking wet!

23:24.470 --> 23:26.471
I gotta believe anything's possible!

23:26.472 --> 23:28.940
When did this happen?
Was it during the storm?

23:28.941 --> 23:33.368
No. Bodhi did it when
I found him. Look.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.847
He did it.

23:48.161 --> 23:52.463
- Daniel, what is that?
- His name's Bodhi.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.701
- I think he heard you.
- Of course he heard me.

23:56.702 --> 24:01.198
He hears everything. Even when
I'm not talking, he hears me.

24:01.507 --> 24:06.367
- Here. He likes to be held.
- It does.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.448
I can feel it likes to be held.

24:09.449 --> 24:12.682
- Hey, Bodie!
- His name is Bodhi.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.321
Jason, can we keep him?

24:16.322 --> 24:19.953
I mean, look, I fixed a bed
and everything. It'll be fine.

24:20.259 --> 24:24.129
It doesn't need a bed.
I mean, it's not alive.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.499
- We don't know that.
- Come on.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.666
Bodhi feels just like we do.
And he's smart, too.

24:33.206 --> 24:36.166
That was the second
call for skate rec.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.776
All right.

24:37.777 --> 24:43.137
Before we go, we all oath that no one
even breathes a whisper about this.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.684
Daniel, I want you to pretend
that you're still deaf.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.786
- Why?
- Because people will start probing,

24:47.787 --> 24:50.712
and we gotta keep this thing
absolutely secret, okay?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.760
- Okay, let's go. Let's move.
- Yeah, we're gonna be late.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.026
Come on, let's move!

24:59.265 --> 25:02.225
Stay here. I'll be right back.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.801
Hi.

27:25.511 --> 27:28.709
Do you get bored just
sitting in here?

27:33.419 --> 27:36.354
I can't believe that I'm sitting
here talking to a ball.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.151
Okay. All right.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.022
I'm sorry.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.821
I'm sorry.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.803
I know that you understand things.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.075
Maybe everything.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.281
But who are you?

28:08.621 --> 28:11.683
Where do you come from?

28:12.692 --> 28:16.584
I know. It's a tough one.

28:19.331 --> 28:22.894
See, I don't know where I come from.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.298
And I don't know who I am, either.

28:29.108 --> 28:34.138
But what's worse is,
I don't know where I'm going.

28:35.648 --> 28:37.640
I don't know who I'm gonna be.

28:42.455 --> 28:46.691
I just know that I can't accept
things the way they are.

28:46.692 --> 28:49.959
I don't want to be part
of what I've seen.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.561
But I guess I'll have to.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.074
- No, it is not a waste of time.
- Yes, it is...

29:36.075 --> 29:38.309
- And I'll tell you why it's not.
- We have a lot of work to do...

29:38.310 --> 29:40.912
- What's going on?
- Is Bodhi okay?

29:40.913 --> 29:45.613
Yeah. Yeah, he's fine.
I was just... holding him.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.285
What's that?

29:47.286 --> 29:51.689
- I just want to see if it's radioactive.
- Can't you just leave it alone?

29:51.690 --> 29:54.993
Look, if we're around something
that's giving off radioactivity,

29:54.994 --> 29:56.795
- we could all end up dead.
- Oh, please.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.221
Just let him do it.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.105
Nothing.

30:17.183 --> 30:20.819
- Hi, Bodhi.
- Hey, Bodie, so you're not dangerous.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.454
It's Bodhi.

30:23.455 --> 30:27.025
Hey, look, he's speaking to you in your
language and me in mine, all right?

30:27.026 --> 30:30.295
- Yeah, but what is it?
- He's a who, not an it.

30:30.296 --> 30:35.030
- Well, then who is it?
- I don't know. I can't figure it out.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.235
- You're kidding.
- What?

30:37.236 --> 30:40.264
Well, I just heard you admit there's
something you can't figure out.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.874
Metron admits to mystery.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.221
Flip it over.

30:58.591 --> 31:01.118
- Don't hurt him.
- We're not gonna hurt him.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.461
I think that he wants to play.

31:25.150 --> 31:28.052
Hey, Metron, pass it over here!

31:28.053 --> 31:30.921
- Flick it to me, Terra!
- Hey, Jas!

31:41.834 --> 31:44.828
Metron, why don't you
try to hit the ball?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.274
Hey! Yeah!

32:02.254 --> 32:04.679
Rabbit, pass it over.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.027
- Can you explain this, Metron?
- I...

32:16.502 --> 32:17.936
Hey, Daniel, here's your chance!

32:17.937 --> 32:20.104
- Put it in the goal! Come on!
- Come on, you can do it!

32:20.105 --> 32:22.273
- Come on, little man!
- Put it up! He wants you to shoot!

32:22.274 --> 32:24.369
Daniel, go!

32:27.813 --> 32:30.315
Daniel's the skateball
champion of the world!

32:30.316 --> 32:31.944
Daniel!

32:43.262 --> 32:45.027
Jason?

32:45.297 --> 32:49.734
Can't we just play one more game?
I mean, Bodhi wants to play, I bet.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.000
And I want to play.

32:52.571 --> 32:56.065
It's late. I think we
ought to head back.

34:29.935 --> 34:34.168
Somebody's free! Oh, I envy him.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.572
- They'll catch him.
- Yeah.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.606
But until they do, he's free.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.248
Toss every crib in here!

34:45.250 --> 34:48.252
- What about the personal areas?
- Toss the personal areas.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.416
Toss everything!

34:57.096 --> 34:58.827
I got the bird boy.

34:59.631 --> 35:03.101
- Anything?
- Nothing! Darstar took it all.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.730
Let's go!

35:30.229 --> 35:34.292
- You can't be in here. It's...
- Daniel's gone.

35:34.867 --> 35:37.701
- What?
- He went after Bodhi.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.439
I think Bodhi called him
or something. I don't know.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.609
- Did you encourage him?
- No, I didn't.

35:44.610 --> 35:48.275
- I wouldn't do that! You know I wouldn't.
- All right.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.782
Get out of here. And we'll
meet in the clubroom.

35:51.783 --> 35:55.846
- So we're gonna go after him?
- Be quiet.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.862
He's a little boy all alone.
I say that we go.

36:04.863 --> 36:08.399
Listen to me carefully. This is
not like sneaking off to the pits.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.635
It's not gonna be 20 meters
in a ditch for this one.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.870
If we do get caught, it's gonna
mean mainstream labor site.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.506
- Or maybe worse.
- Yeah, well, what could be worse?

36:15.507 --> 36:18.068
Like surgical alteration.

36:19.144 --> 36:21.637
Didn't think of that, did we?

36:21.647 --> 36:24.916
They've conditioned us
here to be so afraid.

36:24.917 --> 36:29.587
There has got to be a place to go.
We were not born here.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.156
We had parents on
the outside, families.

36:32.157 --> 36:35.760
People who might still be alive.
Maybe we could find them.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.396
I'm very worried about him.
Please, let's just go.

36:38.397 --> 36:40.965
It sounds like if we go,
we're not coming back.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.066
That's exactly right,

36:42.067 --> 36:44.435
so it's gotta be something that we
all agree on or we just don't go.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.170
- Then we should vote.
- Okay.

36:46.171 --> 36:48.873
- All those in favor...
- No, this should be a secret ballot.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.300
There shouldn't be any peer pressure.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.386
Wait.

37:18.470 --> 37:22.203
- It's unanimous. We go.
- All right!

37:43.528 --> 37:45.623
Rabbit!

37:47.165 --> 37:48.499
- I did it!
- Let's move!

37:48.500 --> 37:50.891
- Yeah!
- All right!

37:54.106 --> 37:56.804
<i>Alerts imposed on all quarters.</i>

37:57.776 --> 38:01.168
But why would they even try
to escape? There's no point in it.

38:01.813 --> 38:05.182
Maybe they were challenged
by the ineptitude of your system.

38:05.183 --> 38:08.108
Maybe they couldn't resist.

38:09.321 --> 38:12.023
- A Tchigani.
- He doesn't know that.

38:12.024 --> 38:14.959
No child here knows
his origin. It's the law.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.662
- He was taken at the age of two months.
- It's in his blood.

38:17.663 --> 38:21.191
There are still some Tchigani camped
in the wastes. He'll find them.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.358
Seven little douchkies all in a row.

38:25.470 --> 38:30.170
How are you going to explain all this to
the inquisitor from mainstream control?

38:34.046 --> 38:35.980
Maybe when you find them
you can bring them back here.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.643
It might pass unnoticed.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.985
But that's not the law.

38:40.986 --> 38:45.379
The law requires that I take them to my
headquarters to be surgically altered.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.490
You're not suggesting that
I break the law, are you?

38:51.730 --> 38:54.465
Of course, you know, I could tell
them what you're always telling me.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.663
That you don't run a prison here.

38:59.104 --> 39:02.029
Grock, I don't want them hurt!

39:02.941 --> 39:04.968
Maybe you should have
thought of that before.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.546
<i>Alerts imposed on all quarters.</i>

39:08.547 --> 39:10.972
<i>Advise perimeter control.</i>

39:16.888 --> 39:19.223
- Jason, we're free.
- Yes.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.025
- I told you, we're free!
- It's nice.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.562
We're free! We're free!

39:25.731 --> 39:29.100
- We're free! All right!
- Yeah!

39:29.234 --> 39:32.467
- We made it!
- I can't believe it! We can breathe!

41:04.529 --> 41:06.260
Wait, wait!

41:10.135 --> 41:12.594
- E-Pigs! They're on our trail!
- Go!

41:49.140 --> 41:51.531
Wait. Wait a minute.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.709
Disassemble the bi-chopper!

42:20.272 --> 42:21.805
Let's go!

42:27.579 --> 42:29.613
- Come on, Jason, run!
- Come on! Come on!

42:29.614 --> 42:32.249
- Come on, jump over!
- Jason, you can make it!

42:32.250 --> 42:35.519
- Jason, watch out! Hurry!
- Come on, Jason!

42:35.520 --> 42:38.115
- Come on, Jas!
- Come on!

42:46.264 --> 42:47.756
Whoa!

42:49.267 --> 42:50.929
Watch out!

42:54.439 --> 42:55.940
- All right!
- Yeah.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.875
- Hooray!
- Yeah!

42:57.876 --> 43:00.836
- We did it!
- All right, we made it!

43:17.996 --> 43:19.954
Yeah, I know.

43:21.466 --> 43:23.595
But where?

43:39.517 --> 43:41.145
Ivor!

43:53.298 --> 43:55.256
What is it?

44:04.275 --> 44:06.477
Who are you?

44:06.478 --> 44:10.143
- I've never been sure.
- Don't be cryptic with me, boy.

44:10.215 --> 44:13.050
I was raised in a
Protectorate orphanage.

44:13.051 --> 44:14.475
That's all I know.

44:14.552 --> 44:16.044
What do they call you?

44:17.055 --> 44:19.189
I call myself Darstar.

44:21.393 --> 44:24.228
The owl. It's yours?

44:24.229 --> 44:26.256
As much as an owl is anyone's.

44:32.303 --> 44:34.398
You are Tchigani.

44:36.508 --> 44:38.375
- Tchigani!
- Tchigani!

45:23.421 --> 45:25.516
What is this place?

45:25.857 --> 45:28.350
It used to amuse people.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.225
Hey, boy!

45:38.703 --> 45:40.437
He's old.

45:40.438 --> 45:43.068
He lives only to keep the past.

45:50.548 --> 45:53.109
You are sooner than expected.

45:53.551 --> 45:56.681
Now show it to me. Show it to me.

46:07.165 --> 46:09.933
- Where did you get it?
- What does it matter?

46:09.934 --> 46:11.401
He brought it to us.

46:12.670 --> 46:16.273
He brought it? He brought it?

46:16.274 --> 46:17.708
I think it brought him.

46:18.810 --> 46:22.045
- I know it has powers, but...
- It has will.

46:22.046 --> 46:24.114
There is the difference.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.483
Stop trying to shuffle our brains.

46:27.685 --> 46:29.987
How can we use it?

46:31.156 --> 46:33.757
The force of will...

46:33.758 --> 46:36.490
Be quiet! I am speaking!

46:37.996 --> 46:43.834
This force of will is not one of your
blind energies which can light a lamp

46:43.835 --> 46:46.328
or make an engine hum.

46:46.805 --> 46:49.366
It chooses its own path.

46:50.575 --> 46:54.706
So that if anybody
is going to be used

46:55.113 --> 46:56.680
it will be you.

46:58.449 --> 47:00.282
Where did it come from?

47:00.685 --> 47:03.246
Some say from the stars.

47:03.888 --> 47:08.325
Some from the genius of Longiness.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.698
You see? It knows his name.

47:14.699 --> 47:17.124
He hid it. He protected it.

47:17.802 --> 47:21.004
Listen, old mutt! I know
this is worth some coin.

47:23.341 --> 47:27.074
The Protectorate fears
the will of the sphere.

47:27.278 --> 47:30.147
Once they know that you
have it, they will spare nothing,

47:30.148 --> 47:33.050
absolutely nothing,
to gain possession of it.

47:33.051 --> 47:34.751
And they'll pay for it?

47:41.025 --> 47:42.687
Get it.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.352
Come on, torch it all!

49:15.353 --> 49:17.846
<i>Prepare to evacuate camp.</i>

49:17.956 --> 49:21.024
<i>Deposit all captives in E-Van 7.</i>

49:33.538 --> 49:36.306
I got him! I whomped his owl!

50:10.575 --> 50:11.908
Danny!

50:13.011 --> 50:17.040
- Stakker!
- Next time, you leave a better trail.

50:18.182 --> 50:21.745
Daniel, we were so worried
about you. Where were you?

50:21.953 --> 50:26.056
Bodhi called me. I had to follow,
but I didn't think you'd come.

50:26.057 --> 50:28.458
What? And miss a trudge
through the desert?

50:28.459 --> 50:29.993
Oh.

50:29.994 --> 50:33.454
Hey, what happened here?
Who trashed this place?

50:34.532 --> 50:36.331
Must have been the E-Cops.

50:37.802 --> 50:39.260
Hey, look!

50:40.571 --> 50:42.165
Darstar.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.771
We should bury it.

50:48.746 --> 50:52.172
- Why?
- Never mind why. We should just bury it.

50:54.218 --> 50:55.585
"Why?"

51:41.933 --> 51:43.867
<i>Bounty hunters, clear the gates.</i>

51:44.969 --> 51:46.670
<i>Allow the E-Vans to enter.</i>

51:46.671 --> 51:49.406
- Hire us? Hire us?
- Won't cost anything. Won't cost anything.

51:49.407 --> 51:51.341
Hire us. I'll go anywhere.

51:51.342 --> 51:53.844
- Private... We are.
- Buy the best, sir. Buy the best.

51:53.845 --> 51:56.839
Come on, we'll go anywhere.
We'll go anywhere.

51:57.315 --> 51:59.282
Two good killers.
Two good men for hire.

51:59.283 --> 52:02.385
Dedicated killers, sir.
Dedicated to your service.

52:02.386 --> 52:05.152
Right. Hey, sir. Wait, wait.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.160
Sir, sir.

52:17.034 --> 52:19.803
Sir, sir. I beg of you, hire us, sir.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.405
We are good men.
Good men, but vicious, sir.

52:22.406 --> 52:24.541
- Please! What have I done?
- Vicious men.

52:24.542 --> 52:27.110
- We spare no expense, sir.
- Please, stop it.

52:28.212 --> 52:31.240
I just want a summer job, Daddy.
Just a summer job.

52:31.883 --> 52:35.685
Show some respect.
Sir. Your Lordship.

52:35.686 --> 52:40.546
Your Lordship. Bounty hunters.
Looking for work, sir. Looking for work.

52:41.159 --> 52:46.062
Whenever and whatever I could
do for you, sir. Anytime at all.

52:46.063 --> 52:47.797
We'll be in touch.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.914
<i>Do you wish to change your story?</i>

53:10.054 --> 53:13.184
It is true. Please.

53:14.025 --> 53:17.427
Please, please, please...

53:20.431 --> 53:22.355
Relieve him.

53:33.411 --> 53:37.514
And you actually saw the
sphere of Longiness?

53:37.515 --> 53:40.584
- I touched it.
- And the boy has it?

53:40.585 --> 53:41.952
Yes.

53:43.321 --> 53:45.211
And the others?

53:47.658 --> 53:52.017
- The boy was not alone.
- No, no, I saw no others. I swear it!

53:56.167 --> 53:59.627
I believe this man has
soiled himself. Wash him.

54:03.641 --> 54:06.676
Please, Strictor,
I told you everything.

54:06.677 --> 54:10.274
I should be rewarded for
what I've done. My reward!

54:12.583 --> 54:16.214
There are a couple of ward-hunters at
the gates. Bring me their leader, Malice.

54:16.988 --> 54:18.878
Clean the room.

54:23.561 --> 54:25.656
You never told me about the sphere.

54:26.697 --> 54:28.064
I didn't know about it.

54:30.067 --> 54:33.536
- Did you enjoy what you just saw?
- No. I mean, yes.

54:35.539 --> 54:37.941
It's a remarkable machine,
don't you think?

54:37.942 --> 54:41.368
You can have whatever you want,
whatever they fear most.

54:43.080 --> 54:46.278
Disease. Rats. Snakes.

54:46.784 --> 54:52.088
How would you like to see the
flesh fall away from your body?

54:52.089 --> 54:56.448
- I oath my life. I never saw a sphere.
- Never?

54:56.627 --> 54:58.828
No! No!

54:58.829 --> 55:00.355
No!

55:00.831 --> 55:02.630
No!

55:02.667 --> 55:03.767
No!

55:08.806 --> 55:12.075
- This is all there is, so make it last.
- Thank you.

55:12.076 --> 55:14.544
Hey, Terra, how do you know
these things aren't poison?

55:14.545 --> 55:16.713
Oh, I saw the birds eating them.

55:16.714 --> 55:19.549
What she didn't see were
the birds dying afterwards.

55:19.550 --> 55:23.977
Hey, listen, sandbrain. She fed us and
that's more than you could do, all right?

55:26.157 --> 55:28.650
- Yeah, she fed us.
- All right.

55:29.460 --> 55:31.361
- And they're good, too.
- All right, Daniel.

55:31.362 --> 55:34.064
- Hey, this one's full.
- What is it?

55:34.065 --> 55:37.767
"The man's brew." I guess that
means you go thirsty, Terra.

55:37.768 --> 55:39.726
Thanks, Tug.

55:40.571 --> 55:41.960
Tug!

55:42.573 --> 55:43.907
Don't drink that! What are you doing?

55:43.908 --> 55:45.175
- Tug! What are you doing?
- It's probably spoiled.

55:45.176 --> 55:46.776
- Oh, no.
- He's crazy.

55:46.777 --> 55:46.876
- You don't know what's in that.
- You're an animal.

55:46.877 --> 55:48.845
- You don't know what's in that.
- You're an animal.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.280
You don't know what
kind of stuff that is.

55:50.281 --> 55:51.414
It could be poison.

55:52.717 --> 55:54.243
Rabbit!

55:55.152 --> 55:56.419
Rabbit?

55:56.420 --> 55:58.521
You guys, come here,
come here, come here.

55:58.522 --> 56:00.150
This is awesome.

56:01.492 --> 56:02.592
What is it?

56:02.593 --> 56:04.756
Look at these guys
in the weird get-up.

56:06.697 --> 56:10.300
These guys are Eco-warriors,
fighting the Protectorate.

56:10.301 --> 56:13.737
- Terra, look.
- What?

56:13.738 --> 56:15.730
Look at this man.

56:28.386 --> 56:32.347
Look, he's wearing the same
symbol you have on your hand.

56:33.357 --> 56:35.315
Hey, Jason, come here.

57:45.429 --> 57:50.596
This magnetron creates a force field
nearly equal to Earth's magnetic pull.

57:51.735 --> 57:56.902
- Sounds impressive.
- It is impressive. It could hold a comet.

57:58.742 --> 58:02.543
But it doesn't explain why it should
interest a Strictor of the E-Police.

58:04.081 --> 58:07.382
Could it hold the
sphere of Longiness?

58:09.053 --> 58:14.390
Or to be more specific, could it
destroy the sphere of Longiness?

58:15.759 --> 58:19.026
Are you suggesting
the sphere still exists?

58:19.663 --> 58:24.124
I'm not the kind of man to take your
valuable time without a reason.

58:25.169 --> 58:26.661
So...

58:27.771 --> 58:32.733
You've actually found
this malignant thing.

58:38.349 --> 58:41.851
- Could you destroy it?
- Shouldn't it go to mainstream control?

58:41.852 --> 58:45.915
And let someone else take credit
for the destruction of it?

58:46.524 --> 58:47.891
Well.

58:49.693 --> 58:54.587
My facility stands ready
to serve, Strictor Grock.

59:10.180 --> 59:14.448
Look at this. And they said
there was nothing out here.

59:15.719 --> 59:17.120
What is this place?

59:17.121 --> 59:19.853
Well, it's definitely not mainstream.

59:19.924 --> 59:21.484
Tiretown.

59:26.030 --> 59:28.489
Sure, I'll tie you up,
if you can afford it.

59:34.538 --> 59:36.406
Looking good, looking good.

59:38.108 --> 59:39.998
Hey, big chunk.

59:40.210 --> 59:42.373
Two quarts and you can
spend a few hours.

59:44.281 --> 59:47.283
- Spend a couple of hours doing what?
- Hey, come on, man. Let's go.

59:47.284 --> 59:48.985
Spend a couple of hours doing what?

59:50.321 --> 59:51.821
Come on, darling.

59:51.822 --> 59:56.124
Grab a poncho, marima skirts.
They're lovely, don't you think?

59:58.629 --> 01:00:01.930
Water! Fresh water!

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.969
Step right up and see the wonders...

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:23.177
Come one, come all.
Watch the human fire-dragon.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.954
Get him!

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:34.197
<i>Extra water privileges awarded</i>

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:37.499
<i>for capture of these
Protectorate fugitives.</i>

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:43.962
<i>Extra water privileges awarded for
capture of these Protectorate fugitives.</i>

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:46.342
<i>Extra water...</i>

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:48.311
I know he came this way, Malice.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:51.613
I seen him. I did.
He just went round that...

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:56.379
We've got him.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.117
He's mine.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:01.988
No, we wait.

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:06.294
We follow. We've got them all.

01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:28.780
Keep moving, vermin.

01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:32.785
Move, you swine!

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:39.662
<i>Dayshift, note.</i>

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:44.267
<i>Partial shutdown on sectional
boilers means reduced distillation.</i>

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:48.938
<i>The water content and
pollution ratios are down.</i>

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:51.569
<i>Fluoride levels are acceptable.</i>

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:59.882
<i>Only those willing to combine shifts
will have a water ration increase.</i>

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:06.119
<i>All others will have a water standard
reduction by 0.25 liters per day.</i>

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.228
This way.

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:25.471
He's here.

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:31.681
We can't wait, come on. Standing out
here is like begging for a bull's-eye.

01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:33.182
- Quiet.
- You sure you can do this?

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:37.542
Sure. It's just like the old
gym lockers. Well, almost.

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:50.592
Try 66.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:56.472
The sphere better be in there,
or you're maimed.

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.670
Just turn the dial to 66,
and you'll have it.

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:03.007
- Sixty-six.
- Hey!

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.254
Hi, Bodhi. See,
I told you he was here.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:27.837
- No. I said forget going back.
- So what are we gonna do, stay here?

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:30.206
- I'd rather go back to the desert.
- And die of thirst?

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:30.540
- I'd rather go back to the desert.
- And die of thirst?

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:32.909
There has got to be a place to go.

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.444
Well, until you're ready to
show us, O earth mother...

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:39.042
- I think we should make it.
- Make what?

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:43.386
- Make our own place to live.
- Make it out of what, Daniel?

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.721
Blink your eyes and take a look
at the real world out there,

01:03:45.722 --> 01:03:48.324
'cause it's a very ugly place.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:51.794
- Bodhi will help us.
- Bodhi got us here.

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:55.064
Metron, you should have
stayed at the orphanage.

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:57.695
- Hey, Terra.
- No, I'm serious!

01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:00.595
You had a future with the Protectorate.
You should've stayed.

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:27.461
We found your owl.
I'm sorry it got killed.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:31.932
- We buried it.
- I know.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:34.903
Why did you take the sphere?

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:38.430
'Cause I thought it would do
magic for me, like it did for you.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.872
It's not simple magic.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:45.509
It's something else.

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:55.391
So, what are you gonna do now?
You gonna stay here?

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.350
For now, anyway.

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:01.589
- What about you?
- I don't know. We can't decide.

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.391
Maybe it's been decided for you.

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:11.133
Come on.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.827
Spread out! Come on, move it!

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:38.766
Come on, up the ramp! I'll hold them!

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:43.366
- Wait, I dropped Bodhi!
- Daniel, no!

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:46.235
- Wait. I have to get Bodhi!
- No!

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:49.862
Bodhi! Bodhi!

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.168
Head for the tires.

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:56.073
- Hop in. Come on, Daniel.
- Get in.

01:07:02.486 --> 01:07:04.453
- That's it. Climb all the way to the back.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:07.049
- All the way to the back. Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.629
- This better work!
- Bye, Daniel!

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.501
Don't let go, Daniel!

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:37.844
Darstar!

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.360
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:55.071
- Rabbit, man.
- You okay?

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:56.439
Yeah.

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:06.615
- Where's Terra?
- I don't know.

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:08.417
- Terra.
- I thought she was behind you.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.785
- No, she wasn't with...
- No, she...

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:15.291
- Terra!
- Jas, wait! Jason!

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:17.488
Terra! Terra!

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:21.322
Terra!

01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:33.402
The place just exploded.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:38.309
Maybe she got out another way.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.618
Yeah. She was slick on her wheels.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.179
Real quick.

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:26.752
Congratulations, Strictor.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:33.163
- Now let's see what you can do.
- Our analysis will take a little time.

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:38.330
But I'll do everything I can
to see you're not bored.

01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:11.234
Not to worry. It's only a
live boy-o they pay for.

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:13.466
Ain't that right, old dog?

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:16.709
That's what the E-Piggies want.
Live young lads.

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:19.813
Make a man's day.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:44.206
Only one. Only a lonely one.

01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:47.176
Not to worry.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:58.287
Water. Water!

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:02.614
- Who flashes water like that?
- Wait!

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:05.726
Wait. We'll barter some.

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:10.389
Did you hear? We'll barter
for what you've got.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:12.634
Bring it here.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.233
- Let's go!
- No.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:20.540
We've got value here.
We don't want to lose it.

01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:25.345
It's only a lithe and little one.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.912
Let's go!

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.834
- Nothing here.
- Are you sure about that?

01:11:56.212 --> 01:11:58.807
- Take a better look.
- Terra.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:04.987
- Terra!
- Terra.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:08.390
- Jason.
- All right, Terra!

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:14.029
- Daniel, I missed you.
- Terra, I can't believe this.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:16.364
You're okay. How'd you get out?

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:20.002
After all your hard work, we couldn't
let you go off empty-handed, boys.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.370
No.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:29.242
Hey, you forgot your boot.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.317
- Hey, take it easy, fellas.
- Bye.

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:38.454
Yeah, take it easy.
Just get a suntan.

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:47.627
- Wait till you see this.
- Hey, where are you taking us?

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:54.470
- What is this place?
- This is where I live.

01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:55.738
Water!

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:58.965
- It's water!
- Water!

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:02.169
Tug, come on, there's more. Come on.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.149
Hey, look. Water comes
right out of the rock.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:10.417
No, it comes from here.
This is called ice.

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:15.686
Thousands of years ago, a giant glacier
was trapped under a lava flow.

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:19.660
As it melts, it feeds the
springs that make our oasis.

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:23.665
This is Greentree. He's my father.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.102
- Your father? This is...
- From the picture.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:30.199
These are my friends. This is Jason.

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:31.607
- Jason.
- Hello.

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.675
- And Rabbit.
- Rabbit.

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:35.411
- This is Metron.
- Metron.

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:38.514
Tug. And the little one
over there, that's Daniel.

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.485
I'm glad to meet Terra's family.
Now you're my family, too.

01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:45.945
This is your home. Come on.

01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:47.921
- Her father?
- Her father?

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:49.725
I don't understand.

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:52.560
Why doesn't the Protectorate take
over here like everyplace else?

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:57.163
This place is our secret
and must be kept.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.961
So have you stopped fighting?

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.131
The Eco-wars took a great toll.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.737
Terra's mother was taken
prisoner and killed.

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:13.206
Our numbers were cut. By now,
the Eco-warriors are only a rumor.

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.207
But there are new generations.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:19.618
Our survival is our victory.

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:24.927
By some extraordinary luck,
our people found Terra and she's here.

01:14:24.928 --> 01:14:27.592
We're all here to stay.

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:44.378
Bodhi doesn't call anymore.

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:48.082
Maybe the E-Police have...

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:57.156
Are we just gonna give up, Jason?

01:14:58.294 --> 01:14:59.661
No.

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:04.095
What are we gonna do?

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:10.900
I never told you this, but Bodhi...

01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:13.741
He showed me something.

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:18.772
We were headed for this place
that we still haven't found.

01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:24.353
So it's not over, Daniel.

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:30.990
So you keep listening.
Listen real hard,

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:35.395
so Bodhi will know you're
trying to hear him.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:58.487
We've reached an apparent null.
I'll reduce the power.

01:15:58.488 --> 01:16:00.651
Just keep cooking it.

01:16:10.767 --> 01:16:15.035
I'm so happy here. We're all
gonna be very happy here.

01:16:16.406 --> 01:16:20.742
Terra, I know what
you've found here. I do.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:24.206
- But the rest of us, we gotta move on.
- No.

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:26.748
We left the orphanage with a purpose.

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:30.585
To find Daniel.
And now Daniel's safe.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.446
We're all safe. This is our home.

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:38.823
Bodhi's gone. It's gone.

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:41.219
I can't believe you're saying that.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:44.162
It's just better forgotten.

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:47.869
What do you mean, forgotten?
What do you know?

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.794
Come on, Terra.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:56.211
Come on, Terra. We've all oathed each
other that there'd never be secrets.

01:16:56.212 --> 01:16:58.876
But I oathed to my father, too.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.478
And that means more?

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.481
Where's the sphere?

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:10.525
His men said that they took it
to the Protectorate aqua bunker.

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:12.761
- The what?
- The aqua bunker.

01:17:12.762 --> 01:17:15.528
It's where they control the water.

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:18.229
Jason, they're gonna destroy it.

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:26.639
- Well, it won't happen.
- What?

01:17:26.943 --> 01:17:30.210
You heard me. I said
it won't be destroyed.

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:50.499
Hey, hey, wait a minute. Wait.
It's stupid to go like this.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.132
Terra, this is our choice. We made
the decision and we're going.

01:17:55.405 --> 01:17:57.864
Well, then maybe this will help.

01:18:04.547 --> 01:18:06.748
- Plans to the aqua bunker.
- Let's go. Come on.

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:08.446
All right!

01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:52.694
Awesome.

01:18:52.695 --> 01:18:55.029
Are you sure we've
got the right place?

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.499
Bodhi.

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:12.012
Enough. It's ready.

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:21.754
The fusion lasers have greatly
weakened the surface shield.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:24.051
Now it gets interesting.

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:27.423
We lock it down and disembowel it.

01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:43.104
It's all yours.

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:49.479
Gentlemen, this is Terminack.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:52.545
He's a multi-capable masterpiece.

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:54.890
He can squeeze the color from a ruby,

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:58.556
or deftly pluck the eye
from a living bird.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:02.793
And he's been programmed
to enjoy what he does.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:11.873
Terminack can actually see
the molecular structure.

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:15.209
He'll find the flaw and punch home.

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:35.356
Ah!

01:20:36.766 --> 01:20:38.394
He's in.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.638
Gates. Main gates.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.934
Ow.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:53.448
- He's got the gates. Let's go.
- Yeah!

01:20:53.449 --> 01:20:55.180
All right.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:00.252
Dogs, huh?

01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:09.925
<i>Hey, what are you doing down there?
Come on, let's get him.</i>

01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:12.395
Say hello to Sparky.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:22.038
- Where's Daniel?
- He's coming.

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:23.739
Come on!

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:27.182
- Daniel, hurry!
- Daniel!

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:30.374
Okay, let's go.

01:21:48.938 --> 01:21:53.604
Terminack's obviously impressed.
A carbon cobalt bit.

01:21:53.776 --> 01:21:56.770
Now he'll drive it
right to the heart.

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:19.067
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, hurry up. Come on.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.869
Be careful, Daniel.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:24.572
- Come on!
- Move it!

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:26.908
- Come on, let's go. Hurry up!
- The dogs. Hurry up!

01:22:26.909 --> 01:22:29.344
- Dogs!
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:22:29.345 --> 01:22:31.212
- Jason!
- Come on, Jason. Come on.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:32.514
Jason.

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:34.683
Jason, be careful. Come on.

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:41.285
<i>- All right, hold it right there.</i>
- You okay?

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.792
<i>Get your hands up. Who are you?</i>

01:22:43.793 --> 01:22:46.127
<i>How'd you get in here?
Come on, who are you, huh?</i>

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.654
Hello.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:55.167
Let's move.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:06.444
Hey, Jason! Over here!

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.651
Stand back.

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:34.973
Impossible.

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:42.908
Sound the alarm.

01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:44.619
- E-Police!
- Grock, do something.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.855
E-Police! E-Police!

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:49.891
Stop them!

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:56.064
Crowbar, Jason.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.532
Crowbar!

01:24:04.974 --> 01:24:07.342
The whip, Jason, the whip!

01:24:07.343 --> 01:24:09.142
Get the eye!

01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:14.816
Cover your back, Rabbit!

01:24:16.085 --> 01:24:18.919
<i>Yellow alert. Yellow alert.</i>

01:24:19.422 --> 01:24:21.723
<i>Activate all manual overrides.</i>

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:25.126
<i>We have a total malfunction
on all circuit controls.</i>

01:24:25.127 --> 01:24:26.428
<i>Repeat.</i>

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:30.230
<i>We have a total malfunction
on all circuit controls.</i>

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.567
Say bye-bye...

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:40.408
Hey, Terra, behind you! Behind you!

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.477
Here comes another one.

01:24:42.478 --> 01:24:45.213
- Yeah! Look out!
- I got this one!

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:46.581
Yeah!

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:12.237
Oh, my. Hello.

01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:15.310
Is this your ball?

01:25:16.479 --> 01:25:18.779
Open it up!

01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:47.942
Grock!

01:25:56.852 --> 01:26:00.312
<i>Red alert. Red alert. Evacuate.</i>

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:04.420
<i>Red alert. Red alert. Evacuate.</i>

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:08.563
Come on, you guys!

01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:12.066
<i>Close auto-locks.
Close all auto-locks.</i>

01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:13.668
Daniel! Follow Daniel!

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:15.770
<i>Bunkers 9 through 11 now closing.</i>

01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:16.871
This place is gonna blow!

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:20.708
<i>Sealed off. Malfunction
on hermetics 14 and 21.</i>

01:26:22.545 --> 01:26:24.708
Get out! Get out!

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:27.982
Quick! Evacuate!

01:27:07.156 --> 01:27:09.353
Look!

01:27:37.052 --> 01:27:39.283
What the hell is that?

01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:43.858
It's a thundercloud.
It's a real thundercloud.

01:27:49.164 --> 01:27:51.165
Wow. It's inspirational.

01:27:51.166 --> 01:27:54.626
Holy-oskie, so that's a thunderstorm.

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:56.632
It's more than just a thunderstorm.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.574
Water's free again.

01:27:59.575 --> 01:28:01.067
Oh!

01:28:03.078 --> 01:28:04.809
It's free.

01:28:13.188 --> 01:28:17.820
Look, Bodhi is better. He's glowing.

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:27.163
Where's Bodhi? He's gone.

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:30.070
He's left us.

01:28:30.773 --> 01:28:33.198
No, look.

01:28:37.079 --> 01:28:40.573
- Hey.
- He's all around us.

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:47.385
Wow.

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:05.707
Look!

01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:46.107
He hasn't left us.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.883
He'll always be with us.
