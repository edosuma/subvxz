00:18.323 --> 00:19.422
This week on Vice:

00:19.457 --> 00:22.592
journalism under attack
on the streets of Manila.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.371
We haven't been at this
crime scene for five minutes,

00:35.407 --> 00:38.574
and already we're getting a call that
there's been another killing in Manila.

00:38.610 --> 00:40.443
And then, turning the tide

00:40.478 --> 00:42.612
against extinction in the Congo.

01:02.433 --> 01:03.632
Go, go, go!

01:06.603 --> 01:08.236
We are not animals!

01:19.850 --> 01:22.883
Freedom of the press
is under fire in America

01:22.919 --> 01:25.286
with the new president
and his administration

01:25.322 --> 01:27.755
openly undermining both the legitimacy

01:27.790 --> 01:29.057
and the value of media.

01:29.092 --> 01:31.492
They so poison the minds of people

01:31.527 --> 01:33.294
by writing false stories.

01:33.330 --> 01:35.063
They are the enemy of the people.

01:36.799 --> 01:39.333
Now, an independent
and unrestricted press

01:39.368 --> 01:43.303
is the very bedrock of a
free and democratic society.

01:43.339 --> 01:45.873
To learn more about
where press freedom stands

01:45.908 --> 01:47.240
here and around the world,

01:47.276 --> 01:49.810
we spoke with legendary
journalist Carl Bernstein,

01:49.846 --> 01:53.046
whose Pulitzer Prize-winning
reporting on the Watergate scandal

01:53.082 --> 01:55.148
toppled a corrupt administration,

01:55.184 --> 01:58.085
leading to President
Nixon's resignation.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.120
You broke one of the biggest stories

02:16.121 --> 02:17.421
in our country's history.

02:17.706 --> 02:19.772
How has the climate
to practice journalism

02:19.808 --> 02:21.440
changed since that time?

02:21.476 --> 02:24.744
It is toxic today.

02:24.779 --> 02:26.913
We're in a state of a kind

02:26.948 --> 02:30.016
of cultural civic war in this country.

02:30.051 --> 02:33.085
So much of the media
is opposition party.

02:33.121 --> 02:35.787
Absolute dishonest, absolute scum.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.157
Remember that. Scum. Scum.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.226
What is similar, incidentally,

02:40.261 --> 02:43.862
between Watergate and what we see now,

02:43.898 --> 02:46.364
is that President Nixon tried to make

02:46.400 --> 02:49.067
the conduct of the press
the issue in Watergate

02:49.102 --> 02:52.237
instead of the conduct of
the president and his men.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.240
Trump is doing exactly the same,

02:55.275 --> 03:00.412
but in a much more
aggressive, inhibiting way

03:00.447 --> 03:02.847
than Nixon ever did.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.058
What is the state of
press freedom globally?

03:13.093 --> 03:16.994
Under attack. Press
freedom is under attack,

03:17.030 --> 03:20.531
partly because those who hold power,

03:20.567 --> 03:24.501
increasingly, uh, are authoritarian.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.837
President Trump's attacks on the press

03:26.873 --> 03:29.840
pale in comparison to a
global war on journalism

03:29.876 --> 03:31.709
where authoritarian regimes threaten

03:31.744 --> 03:33.610
and imprison reporters.

03:33.645 --> 03:37.981
If you cut off the
flow of free information

03:38.016 --> 03:40.484
and the best obtainable
version of the truth,

03:40.519 --> 03:42.553
these people are gonna stay in power.

03:42.588 --> 03:47.224
It's not an accident that
in the Philippines, uh,

03:47.259 --> 03:48.658
you see what is happening.

03:48.794 --> 03:51.160
To understand what happens when freedom

03:51.196 --> 03:53.362
of the press is under
attack by a government,

03:53.398 --> 03:54.831
we look to the Philippines,

03:54.866 --> 03:57.233
which is the single deadliest
place to be a journalist

03:57.268 --> 03:59.936
outside of war zones Iraq and Syria.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.914
The country's president,
Rodrigo Duterte,

04:11.949 --> 04:14.650
is waging a war on the
media, while simultaneously

04:14.685 --> 04:17.120
executing a ruthless war on drugs

04:17.154 --> 04:19.822
that's left thousands
dead in the streets.

04:19.857 --> 04:23.726
We followed one reporter in
Manila covering the drug war.

04:27.632 --> 04:29.131
We're at the Manila police headquarters

04:29.166 --> 04:32.400
to meet up with a journalist
named Aie Balagtas See.

04:32.436 --> 04:33.736
She works the night beat here,

04:33.771 --> 04:35.971
so we're going to join her tonight.

04:36.007 --> 04:38.841
Anyone who wants to do night-crawling,

04:38.876 --> 04:40.742
they hang out here.

04:40.777 --> 04:42.977
In the mornings, it's
just, like, full of laptops,

04:43.013 --> 04:46.248
full of reporters doing
their daily grind stuff.

04:47.518 --> 04:49.217
And so what's the plan tonight?

04:49.253 --> 04:52.487
Every night, someone dies.
You just have to wait.

04:58.394 --> 05:01.729
They just got a call that there's
at least one person who was killed.

05:01.765 --> 05:04.098
It's an hour away, and they
say if you wait that long,

05:04.134 --> 05:07.035
it's very possible that the
body's gonna be taken away by then.

05:07.070 --> 05:11.172
It's widely believed that President
Duterte orders the police to kill

05:11.207 --> 05:13.940
suspected drug dealers
and users indiscriminately,

05:13.976 --> 05:16.644
so journalists race to
investigate the crime scenes

05:16.679 --> 05:18.612
before all evidence is removed.

05:36.331 --> 05:38.431
- They got it already?
- Yeah.

05:58.386 --> 05:59.485
Okay.

06:05.593 --> 06:07.159
This killing fit the profile

06:07.195 --> 06:08.728
of most extrajudicial killings

06:08.763 --> 06:10.830
being executed in the Philippines.

06:10.865 --> 06:12.431
Was he on any kind of official list

06:12.466 --> 06:14.033
as a drug user or a drug dealer?

06:25.346 --> 06:26.545
You know?

06:26.580 --> 06:29.814
Heart's murder fit the
template of countless others.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.150
First, the government puts
the victim on a watch list,

06:32.185 --> 06:34.819
and soon after, they're gunned down.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.833
Since Duterte took office in 2016,

06:48.869 --> 06:51.169
around 9,000 people have
been brutally murdered

06:51.204 --> 06:53.237
in the streets without trial.

06:53.273 --> 06:56.607
Many of them are executed by
assassins working with the police

06:56.643 --> 06:58.208
as part of their crackdown on drugs.

06:59.941 --> 07:02.080
This means that it's often
the journalists themselves

07:02.081 --> 07:04.214
who are left trying to
investigate the cases.

07:04.250 --> 07:07.752
We followed Aie as she
continued her reporting.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.328
- Okay.
- And...

07:33.612 --> 07:35.779
Heart's sister insisted
it was the police

07:35.814 --> 07:37.880
who pulled her from
their home and shot her

07:37.916 --> 07:39.649
as part of their war on drugs,

07:39.685 --> 07:42.018
a common claim among witnesses.

07:52.897 --> 07:54.430
Each night that we followed Aie,

07:54.465 --> 07:56.532
calls poured in from across the city.

08:06.410 --> 08:08.009
We haven't been at this
crime scene for five minutes,

08:08.045 --> 08:09.551
and already we're getting a call

08:09.552 --> 08:11.046
that there's been
another killing in Manila,

08:11.081 --> 08:12.648
so we're gonna head
back there right now.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.313
It quickly became clear

08:46.349 --> 08:47.814
that the story the police told Aie

08:47.850 --> 08:49.783
didn't match what witnesses around us

08:49.818 --> 08:51.318
were reporting at the crime scene.

08:51.354 --> 08:54.521
So, apparently the computer
store around the corner

08:54.556 --> 08:57.457
took a photo of the victim, of the body,

08:57.493 --> 08:59.526
and there wasn't a gun there.

08:59.561 --> 09:01.528
And now, of course, there's a gun there.

09:01.563 --> 09:04.831
So, Aie is going with
him to see if it's true.

09:15.577 --> 09:20.013
One photo is of before
the cops swarmed the body,

09:20.048 --> 09:23.149
and there was no gun,
apparently, in the victim's hand.

09:23.184 --> 09:26.319
And then after the cops
were... had all gathered there,

09:26.354 --> 09:28.788
and there was a gun.

09:28.823 --> 09:30.823
Despite the photos, Aie said they were

09:30.858 --> 09:32.858
too low-quality to publish as evidence.

09:32.894 --> 09:35.895
In fact, she didn't
publish this story at all,

09:35.931 --> 09:38.263
likely due to a culture
of fear among reporters

09:38.299 --> 09:40.900
which often leads to self-censorship.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.637
Investigative journalists have endured

09:44.672 --> 09:46.772
a long history of violence
in the Philippines.

09:46.808 --> 09:49.174
Not only have there been more
deaths of journalists here

09:49.209 --> 09:51.043
than anywhere outside of war zones,

09:51.078 --> 09:54.246
in 2009, the largest
massacre of reporters

09:54.281 --> 09:56.581
in world history was committed here.

09:56.616 --> 09:58.183
Thirty-two were killed,

09:58.218 --> 10:00.718
and to date, there have
been no convictions.

10:02.456 --> 10:04.489
Melinda Quintos De Jesus
has been a journalist

10:04.524 --> 10:06.658
in the Philippines
for more than 30 years.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.694
She explained why journalists
here often self-censor.

10:09.729 --> 10:11.963
What are some of the statistics

10:11.998 --> 10:16.067
that convey how dangerous it is to
be a journalist in the Philippines?

10:16.102 --> 10:19.771
A total of 154 journalists,

10:19.806 --> 10:22.139
counted since 1986,

10:22.175 --> 10:25.343
have been killed because
of the work that they do.

10:25.378 --> 10:27.778
In general, are these
murders of journalists

10:27.813 --> 10:30.247
ever investigated? Is
anyone ever convicted?

10:30.283 --> 10:32.216
So, we've had two convictions.

10:32.251 --> 10:35.419
- Only two?
- Only two clear convictions.

10:35.455 --> 10:39.390
What happens when a journalist
attacks Duterte, or calls him out?

10:39.425 --> 10:43.627
They can expect to have
a barrage of threats...

10:43.662 --> 10:47.197
questioning the legitimacy
of all mainstream media.

10:47.232 --> 10:52.002
But worse, they have gone
as far as basically saying,

10:52.037 --> 10:55.806
"We know where you live. We
know where your family is."

10:56.241 --> 10:58.441
In our short time in the Philippines,

10:58.477 --> 11:00.276
we saw killings happen each night,

11:00.312 --> 11:02.445
but reporters continued
to cover the crimes,

11:02.481 --> 11:04.847
despite working under
threat of execution

11:04.883 --> 11:06.249
by their own president.

11:06.284 --> 11:09.152
I... Jesus Christ.
The body's still here.

11:09.187 --> 11:10.586
Oh my God. Wow.

11:10.622 --> 11:13.556
Have other people been
killed like this around here?

11:18.863 --> 11:20.663
And now they're searching the body

11:20.698 --> 11:23.733
to see if he has any
drugs or anything on him.

11:23.768 --> 11:26.468
So far, they haven't found any drugs.

11:26.504 --> 11:27.603
We met with Peter Bouckaert,

11:27.639 --> 11:29.906
who believes that threats
against journalists here

11:29.941 --> 11:32.807
are as real as the
threats against drug users.

11:32.843 --> 11:35.944
He was just sitting here, and
another motorcycle came by,

11:35.979 --> 11:38.613
and shot him twice in the face.

11:48.526 --> 11:50.559
What is your sense of
who the assailants were

11:50.594 --> 11:52.393
and why this guy was killed?

11:52.429 --> 11:55.463
My first suspects would be the police.

11:55.498 --> 11:57.666
Why do journalists here self-censor?

11:57.701 --> 12:00.101
I mean, what's the danger in
reporting more than what they do?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.336
When the president says just
because they're journalists,

12:02.372 --> 12:06.207
doesn't protect you from being
assassinated, he means it.

12:06.242 --> 12:07.971
You know, if you go after

12:07.972 --> 12:12.280
one of the most prominent
congresswomen in this country,

12:12.315 --> 12:15.249
and tell her that
she's gonna rot in jail

12:15.285 --> 12:18.119
for investigating these killings,

12:18.154 --> 12:21.922
ordinary journalists are
going to be very afraid.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.291
Peter was referring to
Senator Leila De Lima,

12:24.326 --> 12:27.194
who launched an investigation
into extrajudicial killings

12:27.229 --> 12:29.730
when Duterte was the
mayor of Davao City.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.540
The criticism did not
go unnoticed by Duterte,

12:40.576 --> 12:42.976
who lashed out against De Lima publicly.

12:53.922 --> 12:56.022
We've been to a few
crime scenes this week,

12:56.057 --> 12:59.092
and we've seen, you
know, what they look like,

12:59.127 --> 13:00.760
and these cases mirror one another,

13:00.795 --> 13:02.361
at least in our experience.

13:02.396 --> 13:03.930
Who are these assailants?

13:03.965 --> 13:06.365
This could only be
members of death squads.

13:06.400 --> 13:10.837
The president keeps on saying that
up to the last day of his term,

13:10.872 --> 13:13.205
killings... would continue.

13:13.241 --> 13:16.074
It's plain and simple murder,

13:16.110 --> 13:18.177
which is against our law.

13:18.212 --> 13:21.747
How much more can the
public willing to take?

13:22.617 --> 13:26.152
Can we take 100,000?
Can we take a million?

13:26.187 --> 13:30.722
The general populace seems
now to accept the killings,

13:30.758 --> 13:34.492
because of the persistent
and continued...

13:34.528 --> 13:37.829
... propaganda.

13:37.865 --> 13:40.565
With his propaganda machine
running so successfully,

13:40.600 --> 13:43.769
Duterte has an approval
rating of nearly 80 percent.

13:43.804 --> 13:46.671
One of his strategies is to
turn government officials,

13:46.706 --> 13:48.139
like the chief of police,

13:48.175 --> 13:49.440
into celebrities.

13:49.476 --> 13:51.108
PNP chief,

13:51.144 --> 13:55.446
Ronald "Bato" Dela Rosa!

14:49.701 --> 14:51.166
While the public continues to celebrate

14:51.202 --> 14:54.704
Duterte's war on drugs, just weeks
after we left the Philippines,

14:54.739 --> 14:58.006
his police force arrested
his number-one critic.

15:00.278 --> 15:03.212
Senator De Lima was
arrested in February of 2017

15:03.248 --> 15:06.081
on drug charges, accusations she says

15:06.117 --> 15:08.016
are completely baseless.

15:30.540 --> 15:33.475
With Duterte's strongest
opposition now behind bars,

15:33.510 --> 15:37.712
the importance of local journalism
is more pressing than ever.

15:37.748 --> 15:41.415
What's at stake if a
government threatens reporters,

15:41.450 --> 15:45.486
silences them, intimidates them
to the point of self-censorship?

15:45.521 --> 15:48.790
I think there always have been threats

15:48.825 --> 15:51.458
to the press to varying degrees.

15:51.494 --> 15:53.527
Often, those threats

15:53.562 --> 15:55.797
- can threaten journalists' lives.
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.832 --> 15:58.399
Once you start to close down

15:58.434 --> 16:02.569
that ability to present information

16:02.605 --> 16:08.309
that the government or others
might find, uh, unpalatable,

16:08.344 --> 16:10.444
that is the slippery slope.

16:10.479 --> 16:16.783
For people to make informed
decisions about their own lives,

16:16.819 --> 16:20.720
we need truthful,
fact-based information,

16:20.755 --> 16:23.756
and only a free press can do that.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.992
Obstructing a free press

16:26.028 --> 16:28.962
is the first step toward tyranny.

16:30.832 --> 16:33.566
Over the last two decades,
the gorilla population

16:33.601 --> 16:35.735
in the Democratic Republic of Congo

16:35.770 --> 16:37.136
was in danger of disappearing.

16:37.171 --> 16:41.140
Today, however, they're on the
verge of a remarkable comeback.

16:41.175 --> 16:43.643
Ben Anderson has been
covering the story for years,

16:43.678 --> 16:46.645
and he returned to the DRC
to see what's being done

16:46.680 --> 16:49.315
to stop this slide towards extinction.

17:11.704 --> 17:13.372
They look when you say their name.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.458
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:27.954 --> 17:30.421
At the rangers' headquarters
in Eastern Congo,

17:30.456 --> 17:31.890
there is a gorilla orphanage.

17:31.925 --> 17:36.193
Andre Bauma has been protecting
the gorillas for almost 20 years.

17:49.241 --> 17:51.509
The biggest one?</I>  Yeah.

18:05.557 --> 18:08.325
Baby gorillas fetch a huge
price on the black market,

18:08.360 --> 18:11.994
and poachers have killed entire
families to capture just one of them.

18:12.030 --> 18:14.731
Poaching had contributed
to a dwindling population,

18:14.766 --> 18:17.066
which many feared could
lead to extinction.

18:17.101 --> 18:20.437
How do you feel, seeing them
inside an enclosure like this?

18:46.464 --> 18:50.065
Virunga is one of Africa's
bio-diverse national parks,

18:50.100 --> 18:54.402
home to a quarter of the critically
endangered mountain gorillas.

18:54.438 --> 18:57.339
The rangers here risk
their lives to protect them.

19:00.310 --> 19:04.779
So, I stumbled across a graveyard
just like this 13 or 14 years ago,

19:04.814 --> 19:06.881
This is for rangers
who have been killed,

19:06.916 --> 19:11.319
and back then, one in seven rangers
had been killed doing their job.

19:12.356 --> 19:13.955
Came back 10 years ago,

19:13.991 --> 19:15.990
and they actually put me through
their whole training program

19:16.025 --> 19:19.994
and made me become a kind of
honorary Avanced Force Ranger.

19:20.029 --> 19:23.097
I got a green beret and jacket,
went out on patrol with them.

19:23.132 --> 19:25.299
And back then it looked... bleak.

19:25.334 --> 19:27.201
It looked like they were
fighting a losing battle,

19:27.236 --> 19:29.837
and that the hippos and
gorillas we were seeing

19:29.873 --> 19:32.139
could be the last ones here,

19:32.174 --> 19:34.841
because there were so many
rebels and so few rangers.

19:34.877 --> 19:37.711
And the world just
wasn't paying attention.

19:37.746 --> 19:42.049
So I always wanted to come back to
show what heroes these rangers are.

19:42.084 --> 19:44.818
And they still face
serious physical danger,

19:44.853 --> 19:47.554
because there are still loads
of armed groups within the park.

19:49.057 --> 19:52.492
Over 150 rangers have
died protecting the park.

19:52.528 --> 19:55.128
Five more were killed by
rebels just two weeks ago.

19:55.163 --> 19:57.764
But now the park itself is under threat.

19:57.799 --> 19:59.699
Illegal charcoal production,

19:59.735 --> 20:01.968
one of the rebels'
main sources of income,

20:02.004 --> 20:03.737
has caused mass deforestation

20:03.772 --> 20:06.772
and presents a new threat
to the wildlife here.

20:06.807 --> 20:08.508
Innocent Mburanumwe leads

20:08.543 --> 20:11.810
armed patrols looking for
illegal charcoal producers.

20:25.159 --> 20:26.959
Within a few kilometers of their base,

20:26.994 --> 20:29.227
the rangers hear the sound
of trees being chopped.

20:31.031 --> 20:32.334
Yeah.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.627
The poachers escaped.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.437
Right.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.898
Charcoal is made by chopping down trees

21:41.934 --> 21:44.800
and slowly burning them in
an easily assembled kiln.

21:45.937 --> 21:48.404
It's then transported
out of the forest and sold

21:48.440 --> 21:51.674
to the nearly four million
people who live around the park.

21:51.709 --> 21:54.611
For the rebels, it's a
hugely lucrative business.

21:58.716 --> 22:01.751
Another kiln. You can still
smell the burning wood,

22:01.786 --> 22:03.686
so I think this is very recently used.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.121
And this just shows
how widespread it is.

22:05.156 --> 22:07.089
And this is right under
the noses of the rangers.

22:09.460 --> 22:12.962
Big area's been cleared.

22:15.099 --> 22:18.267
So, another kiln. This
may not look like much,

22:18.302 --> 22:22.070
but thousands of people are
doing this across the park.

22:22.105 --> 22:26.375
Some people think the value of
this trade is $35 million a year.

22:26.410 --> 22:30.945
So, that gives you a sense of
how much damage is being done.

22:30.981 --> 22:33.181
Charcoal production has destroyed

22:33.216 --> 22:36.751
at least 30,000 square
kilometers of forest in Africa.

22:36.787 --> 22:39.087
To see the scope of this deforestation,

22:39.122 --> 22:40.488
we flew with the head of Virunga,

22:40.523 --> 22:42.957
a Belgian prince named
Emmanuel De Merode...

22:42.993 --> 22:44.092
Seat belts.

22:44.127 --> 22:45.660
... who took over in 2008.

23:50.258 --> 23:52.570
Emmanuel's solution is
to completely reinvent

23:52.571 --> 23:54.130
the local economy.

23:54.162 --> 23:57.563
Central to this is the construction
of eight hydroelectric plants

23:57.598 --> 24:01.199
that will provide cheap power
to the entire population here,

24:01.235 --> 24:03.502
using Virunga's own natural resources

24:03.537 --> 24:08.440
to end the deforestation that
is causing such devastation.

24:08.476 --> 24:10.609
Virunga National Park can create

24:10.645 --> 24:13.145
between a hundred and 120 megawatts.

24:13.180 --> 24:15.914
That's... 20 times

24:15.949 --> 24:18.583
what the whole city of Goma,

24:18.618 --> 24:21.853
a city of a million people,
is getting at the moment.

24:21.889 --> 24:25.390
You know, with the electricity
that can be generated from Virunga,

24:25.425 --> 24:29.994
we can create between
80 and 120,000 jobs

24:30.029 --> 24:31.663
in the province.

24:31.698 --> 24:35.366
The Congolese Military,
the UN Peacekeeping Forces,

24:35.402 --> 24:36.440
the biggest in the world,

24:36.441 --> 24:40.171
haven't been able to defeat
the rebel groups militarily.

24:40.206 --> 24:43.341
But you think you could
just make them choose to...

24:43.376 --> 24:46.911
to stop fighting because there's
a better alternative for them.

24:46.946 --> 24:49.446
Yeah, they're here to make money.

24:49.481 --> 24:52.016
Until you provide an alternative,

24:52.051 --> 24:53.951
you're not gonna resolve the conflict.

24:53.986 --> 24:56.553
But in the short term, you're removing

24:56.588 --> 25:00.257
a large source of income
for those armed groups,

25:00.293 --> 25:02.926
so you're... you're making
some serious enemies.

25:02.961 --> 25:07.597
Well, you know, it's not a popularity
contest. That... that's true.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.701
That's an understatement.

25:10.736 --> 25:14.371
Emmanuel was shot four times
immediately after filing a complaint

25:14.406 --> 25:16.673
against an oil company
exploring the park.

25:16.709 --> 25:18.474
He was lucky to survive.

25:19.845 --> 25:23.880
So, each one of these turbines
will produce more electricity

25:23.915 --> 25:26.682
than the whole city of
Goma's getting at the moment.

25:26.718 --> 25:30.486
So, really, it's a huge
transformation for the area.

25:30.521 --> 25:33.789
Congo remains one of the
most violent places on Earth,

25:33.825 --> 25:36.058
but there are real
signs of progress here.

25:37.127 --> 25:38.594
Thanks to the efforts of the rangers,

25:38.629 --> 25:42.665
the long-endangered species that
live here could actually survive.

25:44.935 --> 25:47.436
At another park ranger
headquarters at Kahuzi-Biega,

25:47.472 --> 25:51.606
I found the man who trained
me 11 years ago, Elie Mundima.

25:51.641 --> 25:54.576
Ah! How are you?

25:54.611 --> 25:57.045
- Good to see you again.
- How are you?

25:57.081 --> 25:58.546
How are you? Good to see you.

26:02.239 --> 26:03.252
He took me out on patrol to see

26:03.287 --> 26:06.488
how the gorilla population has
fared since I was last here.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.633
You promised last time,
and you kept your promise.

26:20.637 --> 26:23.638
Eleven years ago, we found
a lone silverback gorilla.

26:23.673 --> 26:25.739
This time, Elie showed me something

26:25.775 --> 26:28.209
that would've been
unimaginable back then.

27:58.632 --> 28:00.131
I see 12.

28:02.269 --> 28:03.734
Twelve?

28:03.769 --> 28:05.936
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

28:15.815 --> 28:17.882
There were less than
700 mountain gorillas

28:17.917 --> 28:20.718
left in the world when
I was here in 2006.

28:20.753 --> 28:23.387
Now there are approximately a thousand.

28:23.422 --> 28:26.189
This progress is remarkable.

28:26.225 --> 28:28.058
And although the gorillas
are still endangered,

28:28.093 --> 28:30.360
it looks, for the first
time in a long time,

28:30.396 --> 28:32.930
as if there is a good
chance it will continue.

28:35.167 --> 28:36.699
- He can't hear me.
- Yeah.

28:36.735 --> 28:39.169
You make to do... you make a wave.

28:39.204 --> 28:40.837
- Good.
- Very good.
