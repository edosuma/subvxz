00:01.736 --> 00:03.238
I'm mad for you, Diane.

00:03.304 --> 00:06.979
Roger's dating already?
O. M.G., I wonder if she's younger than him.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.453
Can you hold on a second?

00:09.510 --> 00:11.922
Lorraine, how's my favorite client?

00:11.979 --> 00:13.890
I've been on something
of a hot streak at work.

00:13.948 --> 00:18.055
I've tapped into a rich vein of new clients-
recently divorced moms.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.293
You might say I hit
the single mother lode.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.357
How about that master suite, huh?

00:23.424 --> 00:25.233
Maybe if I had someone to share it with.

00:25.292 --> 00:30.332
Lorraine, you are a beautiful woman
with a lot to offer.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.810
Should we make an offer?

00:32.867 --> 00:36.041
It's a great house,
but I'm just gonna be alone.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.175
Diane, you're not gonna be alone.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.481
You're gonna get a loan.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.317
Sodas, snacks.
Poker game's in the basement.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.152
Look, I need more sleep than you...

00:45.212 --> 00:47.658
and ever since they cut down
that stupid prune tree...

00:47.715 --> 00:49.786
the sun has been right in my eyes
every morning.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.796
It's not a prune tree.
They pruned the tree.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.456
And I'm not switching places with you...

00:53.521 --> 00:55.899
so you should just put your head
at the other end of the bed.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.994
Why? So my feet get the pillow?
And I'm the dumb one.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.802
Diane, you have got to forget about him.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.172
- Roger's Cheyenne's problem now.
- Honey-

01:04.230 --> 01:09.510
You know what? You need to talk.
Starbucks for a little go juice?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.379
- What is up?
- I need to go into the office.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.282
My dad wants me to close out the monthly.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.877
- What?
- Monthly. Never mind. Go on.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.549
I'm stretched a little thin today,
so I need you to do the grocery shopping...

01:18.612 --> 01:21.286
check in on the kids and maybe
clean up those branches in the front yard.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.692
- Done and done.
- Is that an expression...

01:23.751 --> 01:25.788
or did you really only remember
two of the things I said?

01:25.853 --> 01:27.799
- The second.
- I'll leave you a message.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.061
Okay.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.059
Hello?

01:32.126 --> 01:34.072
- Phil.
- Sorry. Call back.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.006
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:37.064 --> 01:39.101
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:39.166 --> 01:41.271
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:41.335 --> 01:43.110
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:43.170 --> 01:44.240
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:48.576 --> 01:50.522
I have bad news, Jay.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.218
Joe was thrown out of the Gymboree.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.759
Again? What happened?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.488
He pushed Mason. He made him cry.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.053
The teacher said that we cannot go back.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.895
That's ridiculous. Mason's a big baby.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.935
Everybody there is a big baby.

02:02.990 --> 02:06.335
But Joe plays very rough, and we know why.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.066
it's the curse.

02:08.128 --> 02:12.339
Not that I'd ever want to discourage you
from whispering- That's not a thing.

02:12.399 --> 02:15.175
There is a mark of the devil in my family.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.445
My great-great grandfather
was given the location...

02:18.506 --> 02:20.543
of an emerald mine...

02:20.608 --> 02:21.882
in exchange for his soul.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.388
There's, like, paperwork
or something that proves this?

02:24.445 --> 02:27.722
They say that the day of
his daughter's wedding...

02:27.781 --> 02:32.855
a great bird came from the sky and snatched him
with his claws and took him far, far away.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.457
You're aware that a remarkable number
of your stories end...

02:35.523 --> 02:37.935
with a family member
being carried off by a giant bird.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.471
I only know what I was told, Jay.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.200
I'm just saying, after the third time...

02:41.262 --> 02:43.970
we might think about
moving the party inside.

02:44.031 --> 02:48.036
Okay, maybe it's not the curse, but you know
that my family has a very dark side.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.548
My cousin Aurelio is a horse thief.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.811
My Uncle Carlos fixed soccer games.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.479
Did he teach them to pick the ball up
and throw it down the field?

02:55.543 --> 02:56.988
'Cause that's the only way you fix soccer.

02:57.044 --> 03:00.082
Manny escaped it,
but I am not sure about Joe.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.821
Gloria, this is about an uptight teacher.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.829
And so what if Joe's a little boisterous?

03:04.885 --> 03:07.729
Whatever happened to letting
kids be themselves?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.461
- Ready.
- Lose the hat.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.833
I guess I'm supposed to see
Sound of Music in a regular hat.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.303
Nothing against Sound of Music..

03:13.360 --> 03:15.397
But there's a lot of other things
we could do this afternoon.

03:15.462 --> 03:18.102
- You ever hear of Death Wish?
- Oh, I love Death Wish.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.509
Manny, that's the charity
where the sick kids...

03:20.568 --> 03:22.605
go to, like, a concert with Madonna...

03:22.670 --> 03:25.446
or to the Super Bowl
with Justin Bieber or they-

03:25.506 --> 03:27.486
No, no, no.
It's a movie. New York, '70s.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.181
Charles Bronson's a firm family man-

03:30.244 --> 03:33.157
Who's pushed to the limit
until one day he decides to fight back.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.887
- You've seen it?
- It's called Death Wish.

03:34.949 --> 03:38.362
I doubt it ends with him trading banter
in an apartment with Marsha Mason.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.661
- Hey, fiancé.
- Hello, my intended.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.034
- That one sounds a little murder-y.
- You are my intended.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.663
Stop it. Stop it!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.799
So, while you're out,
I'm gonna review our flower options.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.070
And I have to say,
so far I'm partial to Floral and Hardy...

03:52.132 --> 03:55.079
but I'm gonna give one last look
at Florist Gump.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.842
You love a business with a clever name.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.542
I do. Guilty.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.984
Can I just say I love how this is going?

04:01.041 --> 04:04.648
Mitchell and I agreed that I would be
in charge of the wedding...

04:04.712 --> 04:07.192
after the tragic news
last week from the Andys.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.660
Uh, not the mountain range. No.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.788
Our friends Andrew and Andrew-
they broke up.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.662
The stress of planning a wedding
was too much. They were quibbling about-

04:14.722 --> 04:16.360
Everything.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.994
I mean- Which is why I'm just happy
to stay out of his way.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.403
Yeah. I dream big, then I winnow down.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.839
Dream big. Winnow down.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.341
- Dream big.
- Okay, winnow down.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.674
Yep. Stay out of my way. Sorry.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.078
Daddy, where's Larry?

04:29.136 --> 04:31.275
Oh, well, you know how cats are, sweetie.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.181
They're- They're wanderers.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.186
But I haven't seen him in days.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.483
Well, he'll be back, okay?
Trust Daddy on this.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.683
Okay.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.660
You know, I'm starting to get worried
that Larry might not come back.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.389
- Oh, he's definitely dead.
- What?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.953
Yeah, street meat or coyote chow.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.227
We'll wait a couple weeks
and then we'll get a new Larry.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.896
Uh, you're pretty nonchalant
about our family pet dying.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.371
And shouldn't we help our daughter
process this loss?

04:54.428 --> 04:56.430
Yes, we will, and she'll be fine.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.534
And it's not nonchalant.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.875
It's farm life. Death is everywhere.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.175
You just learn to not get
too attached to anything.

05:03.237 --> 05:06.912
So, what, if I were to die, you would just
wait a few weeks and then replace me?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.181
Of course not.

05:09.243 --> 05:12.656
Where would I find another gay Mitchell
with your exact markings?

05:18.052 --> 05:19.929
What's happening, Big Al?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.796
Yeah, let's go ahead
and veto that nickname.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.495
Hey, Reuben taught me this cool trick.
Close your eyes.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.299
Oh, my God! What is wrong with you?

05:29.363 --> 05:32.207
You kissed a girl. Now we're even.
Just paying off a poker debt.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.303
Luke's creepy friend just kissed me.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.279
Ew, Reuben? That little weirdo?

05:36.337 --> 05:38.943
- I'm still here.
- I'm gonna go boil my mouth.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.816
Oh, hey, guys. Game is downstairs.

05:41.875 --> 05:46.221
Hey. This little game you dorks play,
we talking milk money or heavy cream?

05:46.280 --> 05:48.089
A lot of fresh bar mitzvah money
down there.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.220
- Mind if I sit in?
- We kind of got a no-girls policy.

05:51.285 --> 05:54.232
Is it a policy or just something
that keeps happening?

05:54.288 --> 05:56.928
The second.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.099
- Hey, honey.
- I am so excited, I can't stand it!

06:02.162 --> 06:04.836
If you're gonna move your hands around
like that, you need to put the phone down.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.903
Okay, okay, okay. For cocktail hour,
they're creating a running waterfall...

06:08.969 --> 06:13.076
onto which they're going to project
a hologram of us embracing.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.814
- But we're still winnowing, right?
- Already winnowed.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.550
I cut the angel costumes.
Hard choices, Mitchell.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.614
Okay, I got to go. I'm so excited!

06:20.681 --> 06:22.558
Yeah, me too.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.445
Best thing about my relationship with Cam?

06:40.501 --> 06:41.707
Trust.

06:41.769 --> 06:45.615
Newsflash- I can be an obsessive person.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.982
In the past, I've had trouble
letting someone else call the shots.

06:52.045 --> 06:55.356
Giving up control made me crazy.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.529
That's what makes
my life with Cam so freeing

06:59.586 --> 07:04.035
I can turn over big things to him
and never give them a second thought.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.401
Out of sight, out of mind

07:06.460 --> 07:08.098
Bye-bye.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.342
Phil! Oh. This is-

07:20.407 --> 07:22.387
Oh! Oh, my God!

07:22.443 --> 07:24.980
Phil? Phil!

07:25.045 --> 07:27.321
Yeah, I was just sitting there,
and he basically molested me.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.655
Excuse me?

07:28.715 --> 07:30.820
- She's talking about Reuben.
- Who are you?

07:30.884 --> 07:33.524
You boys better have money.
I am not doing this for free.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.157
Wh-Wh-What's- What's happening?

07:35.222 --> 07:38.601
Oh, I hear you, Joyce.
His time's important, your time isn't, right?

07:38.659 --> 07:42.106
Let me buzz you back, superstar. Okay.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.369
- Hey, honey.
- Branches are still in the front yard...

07:44.431 --> 07:47.469
I just took a rake to the face,
Reuben is getting really weird on Alex...

07:47.534 --> 07:50.606
and Haley's doing something for money
in the basement.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.174
It's all gonna be fine.
Daddy's home, superstar.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.449
No. Don't call me that.
I'm not one of your needy little divorcées.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.615
Um, that is work.

07:58.679 --> 08:02.957
Is it? 'Cause I kind of feel like part of you
loves being a hero to those women.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.622
- I'm a helper of people.
- Mmm.

08:05.686 --> 08:09.964
Hey, you knew what you signed up for
when you hitched your wagon to a Realtor man.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.936
Honey, when I met you,
you were a wedding deejay.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.803
By the way, Spinderfella, looks like
you still need to hit the grocery store.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.399
I think someone's feeling neglected.

08:17.464 --> 08:20.707
Yes, I deal with a lot of lonely women.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.475
But there's only one I'm married to.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.039
You're getting too involved, Phil.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.086
You are juggling these women,
and you're not that good a juggler.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.213
Now you're just lashing out!

08:32.546 --> 08:35.152
Hey, come here.

08:35.215 --> 08:39.789
I didn't tell Jay,
but sometimes Joe even scares me.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.265
Lucky for me, there are professionals...

08:42.322 --> 08:45.428
that are trained
to deal with such problems.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.438
Ay. thank you for coming, padre.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.805
Oh, of course, Gloria.
And this must be Fulgencio.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.969
- Mm-hmm.
- What a beautiful little boy.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.104
He's such a sweet nature.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.977
- I can tell he's a gentle soul.
- Sí.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.278
¡Ay.!

08:59.339 --> 09:01.114
Fulgencio, no, no. Ay. Ay.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.678
¡Ay.! Sorry, padre.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.817
Ay. that's why I called you, Father.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.090
I think he's bad.
There is evil in my family.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.188
Ah, Gloria, he's just a little baby.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.996
Last week, his eyes got red,
and the dog backed away.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.368
He probably just had a cold.
All mothers worry.

09:20.427 --> 09:24.500
Look at him- rosy cheeks,
he's playing with his blocks.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.944
The six again.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.073
So Joe knocks one kid down, he's out.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.984
All kids do that. Why do you think
your whole building is made out of Nerf?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.817
Yeah, you see where he gets it from.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.652
Hey, listen, I'm not afraid of you,
Miss Debbie.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.555
You're not the- Damn it.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.151
Sounds like someone needs
a relaxing trip to Nazi-occupied Austria.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.661
Can't believe she hung up on me.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.026
Well, you were yelling at her.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.498
Standing up for yourself
is not the same thing as-

09:48.555 --> 09:50.501
- Excuse me.
- Come on, Jay.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.230
So no one ever taught you manners, huh?

09:52.292 --> 09:55.762
- Whatever, dude.
- No, you bump into somebody, you apologize.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.240
And since I'm teaching you
something here...

09:57.297 --> 10:00.141
- here's a little class called "Intro to Pants."
- Jay, stop!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.838
Get off me!

10:01.902 --> 10:04.815
I go to school with those kids.
You know how embarrassing that was?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.818
- Manny!
- No. Why do you always got to be like this-

10:07.874 --> 10:09.945
judgmental, hot tempered, loud?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.853
These are a few
of my least-favorite things.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.554
Well, I can see that the house
speaks to you, Diane.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.064
"Buy me." Not now, house.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.590
- The open floor plan, the spacious kitchen.
- I do love it.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.295
Yeah. Oh.

10:25.359 --> 10:28.363
That's- That's the office. Why don't you
take one last look at the backyard?

10:28.428 --> 10:30.203
Did someone say barbecue? "I did."

10:32.733 --> 10:36.875
Lorraine, what is up?

10:36.937 --> 10:40.350
Nothing. Just... kicking it at the office.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.081
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down now.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.622
Tell Phil what happened.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.885
Phil, can I go in the garage?

10:46.947 --> 10:48.722
Make yourself at home, sister.

10:51.218 --> 10:55.325
Hey. That was my sister
who is visiting town...

10:55.389 --> 10:57.801
and my office, which is where
I am calling you from.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.361
You called me.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.534
I'm worried about Larry.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.771
Oh, honey, I know.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.312
Where is he?

11:08.368 --> 11:11.042
Um, Lily, there's probably
something I should tell you.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.042
Larry's not coming back home.

11:15.108 --> 11:19.079
- Why? Is he dead?
- Nope. Um, not dead.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.923
Larry, uh, met someone,
fell in love and he got married.

11:22.983 --> 11:28.194
- Are they ever going to visit?
- I'm afraid not, because when cats get married...

11:28.255 --> 11:30.997
they have to move to, um, the forest...

11:31.058 --> 11:34.631
and so then they're not tempted
by other cats in the city.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.504
- It's Larry.
- I know.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.873
Even people that you would never expect
have moments of weakness.

11:38.932 --> 11:42.072
No, over there. But where's his wife?

11:42.135 --> 11:44.172
Hello, Larry. Larry's back.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.683
Yeah. Uh, well, you know what?

11:46.740 --> 11:49.687
I think they probably, uh,
didn't work out and they broke up.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.484
People get married and then break up?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.491
What if that happens to you and Daddy?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.652
Oh, you know what? Daddy made a mistake.

11:55.716 --> 12:00.426
Uh, Larry and his wife didn't break up.
Larry's wife... died.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.694
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.464
That's why we're gonna give him
the closure he needs...

12:05.525 --> 12:07.971
by throwing, um, a funeral...

12:08.028 --> 12:11.566
to celebrate the remarkable life
of Larry's wife.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.235
it's gonna be great. You know what?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.507
We're gonna have music. We're gonna get a shoe box.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.775
We're gonna have candles.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.976
Yes, hi, Florist Gump. it's me again.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.350
It felt good
to handle that crisis on my own.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.389
In the past, I would have had
to run to Mitchell...

12:24.444 --> 12:27.687
but he's been trusting me more and more.

12:27.748 --> 12:31.560
I'm so proud of him.
He's really learned to let things go.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.288
Oh, no! God, no, no, no!

12:35.355 --> 12:36.993
Oh!

12:48.034 --> 12:50.105
- What?
- It's a bloodbath down there.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.241
- We lost everything.
- I thought you were good.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.842
I always beat Dylan.
Come on, we need your help.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.478
You're the best card player
in this family.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.217
- What's in it for me?
- A chance to be a good sister.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.852
- Pass. - Reuben's been telling
everyone you slipped him the tongue.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.191
Move.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.958
I thought cats had nine lives.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.435
Yeah, and they do,
but Larry's wife was older than he was...

13:12.492 --> 13:14.768
and she'd been married eight times before.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.273
Like Elizabeth Taylor?

13:16.329 --> 13:19.469
Oh, you remember our bedtime stories.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.705
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, Dylan.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.542
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.604
I need you to dig a hole right over here.
Thank you.

13:24.671 --> 13:28.016
Oh, no problem.
So, Lily, I'm really sorry.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.554
- How's Larry doing?
- Fine. He's a happy cat.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.590
Oh, they're cats.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.717
That's gonna make my job a lot easier.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.558
Okay, everyone, thank you for coming.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.292
It means a lot to Lily,
and it means a lot to me.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.356
Angus?

13:43.423 --> 13:46.199
So, Larry's wife. What can I say?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.762
She loved Larry. And, um, you know...

13:48.829 --> 13:51.673
like all cat marriages,
they had their ups and their downs...

13:51.731 --> 13:53.938
but they always landed on their feet.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.276
Oh, hit a rock.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.974
Oh, not a rock!

13:58.038 --> 13:59.745
Okay, everybody! Please stay calm!

13:59.806 --> 14:03.777
Please stay calm! No running! it's slip-
Angus, keep playing!

14:03.844 --> 14:05.346
Okay.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.053
- Randall!
- Yeah?

14:10.116 --> 14:11.720
I'm up here.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.594
Mr. Pritchett!

14:13.653 --> 14:15.963
This is all intern work.
It isn't for my band.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.660
Need me to do a coffee run?

14:17.724 --> 14:20.432
No. No, uh, listen.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.100
I was- I was cleaning,
and I got stuck up here.

14:24.164 --> 14:28.704
And I need you to go into my office
and stand up the ladder that fell.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.803
Got it.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.407
And I'm sorry about lying before.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.419
Those are flyers for my band, The interns.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.455
Uh-oh.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.047
- Your door's locked.
- Oh, no.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.650
But hey, I-I think,
if you keep going forward...

14:42.716 --> 14:44.320
then back your legs out
through the vent...

14:44.384 --> 14:46.295
I can grab them to help you down.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.492
Oh, I don't know.
That makes me a little nervous.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.002
Just think about something else. I heard
you're getting married. How's that going?

14:52.058 --> 14:55.699
Oh, yeah, yeah. it's- it's good.

14:55.762 --> 14:56.763
It's good.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.673
You know, we're planning it right now.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.110
Actually, it's being planned for me.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.874
That's nice. No stress.

15:02.936 --> 15:06.440
Oh, you'd think, huh?
But it's getting a little bit out of hand.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.179
Oh, that happens with weddings.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.812
Does it? I mean, how many weddings
have you been to...

15:10.877 --> 15:13.084
that have something called a dove cannon?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.558
You know, I think I should have a say
in something like that.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.117
You need to let go, Mr. Pritchett.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.596
I-i can't. I-I wish I could, but I can't.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.190
I just- it's freaking me out.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.859
No. I've- I've got you already.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.926
Oh. Okay.

15:25.992 --> 15:29.599
Oh. Thank you.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.337
You know, I'm pretty good
at reading people...

15:32.399 --> 15:35.209
and it sounds like you and your lady
really need to talk this out.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.044
Yeah, maybe you're right.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.176
So I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.482
- I'm gay.
- Oh, my God.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.489
Does she know?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.889
Gotta save something
for the wedding night, huh?

15:47.948 --> 15:49.052
Okay.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.556
Riley, no! Buster, please sit!

15:52.619 --> 15:54.121
Dylan, help!

15:54.187 --> 15:57.532
I can't.
These cats and dogs are fighting like-

15:57.590 --> 16:00.036
- Oh!
- Okay, everybody, I'm sorry.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.563
This was supposed to be a small service,
but I don't winnow down.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.476
I overdo. And if I let a simple
fake cat funeral get out of hand...

16:07.534 --> 16:10.947
how am I supposed to plan
an entire wedding?

16:11.004 --> 16:13.280
You're late. Okay-

16:13.340 --> 16:16.082
- I need Mitchell.
- Good news. He just pulled up.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.884
Damn it. Okay, in, in, in.

16:18.945 --> 16:22.916
Yes. Okay. And, please,
can somebody catch that thing?

16:22.983 --> 16:25.224
Okay, all right, stay. Everyone just-

16:26.686 --> 16:28.688
Hey! How was the gym?

16:28.755 --> 16:32.134
I never made it.
Listen, Cam, I gotta talk about something.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.969
I do too. What would you think about
being more involved with the wedding?

16:36.029 --> 16:38.202
That's what I wanted to talk about.
I would love to.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.905
Thank God. You know, I just think we're-
we're better together.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.539
"Better together." Mmm, I like that.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.418
I cannot be in a house with snakes.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.819
- How bad is it?
- Gonna need about an hour.

16:51.878 --> 16:52.982
Wow. Okay.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.582
There you go.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.320
I got you Sno-Caps...

16:56.383 --> 16:58.488
'cause, you know, at the end,
they escape across the Alps.

16:58.551 --> 17:02.556
- Thanks for ruining it.
- Calm down. The movie's 50 years old.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.296
Making friends everywhere, aren't you?

17:06.659 --> 17:08.969
Listen, you always say
express your feelings.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.009
When I get mad, that's what I do.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.511
Hello? Yeah, I can talk. My parents
dragged me into this stupid movie.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.773
♪♪Go ahead, Jay. Feed him his phone.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.440
You're telling me that doesn't bother you?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.246
I can't hear you. Talk louder.

17:20.306 --> 17:24.015
I'm just saying if we give in to every impulse,
we're no better than wild animals.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.579
But if we push it down, it eats you alive.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.090
Not if you just let it go.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.821
The chick from that crapfest Mary Poppins.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.624
That's it.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.363
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:35.422 --> 17:39.461
A lot of cold, lonely nights in that apartment
by myself while my mom was driving a taxi...

17:39.526 --> 17:41.369
and only one thing kept me company.

17:41.428 --> 17:45.035
So you got a problem with Poppins,
you got a problem with me.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.773
Ay. Father, I am so sorry.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.906
I didn't even know
that he could hold a fork.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.677
No, no, no. I blame myself.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.616
I probably shouldn't have taken his nose.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.585
No, it's my family.

17:56.643 --> 18:00.557
The girls are very chesty, but the men-
they're kissed by the devil.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.025
Gloria, the fact
that you are so concerned...

18:03.083 --> 18:06.087
is only proof that you are
a loving and caring mother.

18:06.152 --> 18:09.031
It's the parents who shape the child.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.660
And your son is growing up in a wonderful home.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.897
- Die, scum!
- No, no, no!

18:13.960 --> 18:15.633
Louder, like you did at the drive-through.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.232
Mom, Jay and I saw Death Wish. Amazing.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.279
Manny got in a fight
at The Sound of Music, got kicked out.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.644
I've never been so proud.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.150
Well, I guess every household
could use a little fine-tuning, huh?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.744
- Let me give you my card with my cell number on it.
- Please.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.652
And what did I do with my wallet?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.987
I-

18:41.821 --> 18:44.700
I had yelled at Phil for not helping out,
and there he was...

18:44.757 --> 18:47.203
doing exactly what I had asked him to do.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.935
There's our zucchini. Up top, buddy.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.908
For some other family.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.139
You are so sweet for helping me with this.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.976
How hurt you've been, Lorraine.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.846
This is sweet. This is... normal.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.382
- Phil?
- Diane?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.980
- Hey, superstar.
- I thought I was superstar.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.082
Oh, your husband
has been so wonderful to me.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.650
He's not my husband. He's my Realtor.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.923
- Oh, he's my Realtor.
- I'm both your Realtors.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.057
- I'm just lucky to have such a-
- We're on our way to an open house.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.465
Oh, is that why you couldn't show me
the colonial later?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.094
I made that corn bread that you like.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.639
We're gonna make it to that.
I just have to finish up with Lorraine.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.106
- Oh, you mean, like, "get it over with"?
- No, I don't mean that.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.373
And I thought zucchini bread was your favorite,
or why- why am I buying zucchini?

19:27.433 --> 19:30.175
Hey, can't a guy like zucchini bread
and corn bread?

19:30.236 --> 19:32.113
- Phil?
- Damn it.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.743
- Ronnie!
- I thought you had a doctor's appointment.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.946
That's why you had to miss
Darrell's swim meet.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.956
- Who's she?
- Just another client.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.788
- "Just another client"?
- No, that's- What is this?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.987
Uh-oh. it is. it's my office.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.791
Got to take it. Hello?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.230
- Phil?
- Claire?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.461
World's greatest Realtor!

19:50.523 --> 19:51.934
What are you doing here?

19:51.991 --> 19:53.595
Your hair is sweating.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.662
That's 'cause I'm excited
to see my friends.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.571
Let's go, buddy.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.837
Are you all clients of Phil's?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.435
- Apparently.
- Uh-oh.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.606
You could not be in better hands.

20:03.670 --> 20:07.083
I met Phil when I was
at such a rocky place in my life.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.916
He was available to me
morning, noon and night.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.287
Of course he found me my dream house,
but that wasn't the best part.

20:13.346 --> 20:17.021
Phil taught me how to trust a man again...

20:17.083 --> 20:19.085
and I think that was always his plan.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.325
- That was always my plan.
- Mmm.

20:21.387 --> 20:25.130
And it was not easy for me to trust a man
after the husband that I'd had.

20:25.191 --> 20:29.003
This guys left tools in the yard,
let the kids run wild.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.508
- Well, great to see you, Claire.
- He was always interrupting me.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.773
And he wore the most ridiculous
sleep mask thing.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.041
Oh, God! Sounds like such a diva.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.243
- Yeah.
- Or he's photosensitive, which is a real condition.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.809
He never took my advice.
You know, that's the worst part.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.685
He never- He never said he was
sorry just one time.

20:45.745 --> 20:50.387
I would kill to have heard,
"Claire, you were right."

20:51.918 --> 20:53.898
She was right.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.660
Louder!

20:55.722 --> 20:58.032
I do not love this side of you.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.031
Thanks for winning my computer back.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.373
And getting me all my money.
That was awesome.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.709
Yeah, if only I had stopped there,
but I had to go back down.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.680
I got greedy, and I was careless.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.344
There's a story about that
I remember from school.

21:14.407 --> 21:17.854
Icarus flew too close to his son.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.083
I think their wings bumped.
One of them fell.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.251
They might have been ducks.
Anyway, the lesson is...

21:22.315 --> 21:23.988
is that you have to pay attention.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.859
Or pay the ultimate price.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.664
Shall we, my dear?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.997
- Don't wait up.
- Wait up.
