WEBVTT

00:01.751 --> 00:02.752
I will be happy to e-mail you

00:02.836 --> 00:04.462
the itinerary
for the European tour.

00:04.546 --> 00:05.922
No, it's not a problem
at all.

00:06.005 --> 00:08.048
Okay, thank you, bye-bye.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.885
Who ate my yogurt?

00:10.969 --> 00:15.140
Which one of you
greedy, selfish, little..

00:15.223 --> 00:17.058
Oh, there it is.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.603
Sorry, guys. Love ya!

00:22.188 --> 00:24.357
Oh, there she is.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.817
- Holly Tyler?
- Yeah?

00:25.900 --> 00:27.902
Jim DeMarco, Federal
Communications Commission.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.363
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.573
We're investigating
some illegal music downloading

00:32.656 --> 00:34.200
that we've traced
to your computer.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.370
What? I mean,
Holly Tyler's not in today.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.873
You are aware
that downloading music

00:39.956 --> 00:42.125
without paying for it
is a felony.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.712
What? I mean,
everybody does it.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.297
You don't think that
every single person

00:47.380 --> 00:48.923
in this room hasn't
downloaded a song..

00:49.007 --> 00:51.134
[all murmuring]

00:52.761 --> 00:55.346
Miss Tyler, we're gonna have to
take you down to the station.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.348
The station?
The police station?

00:57.432 --> 00:58.933
Okay, it was one
Ricky Martin song.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.352
He should be happy
that I'm interested.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.230
- Gotcha!
- Gotcha!

01:05.315 --> 01:06.816
[laughing]

01:06.900 --> 01:08.526
- Dude, you were great.
- What?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.986
What was great?
Who-who was great?

01:10.069 --> 01:12.155
He was great.
This was all a joke.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.782
Jim's a bike messenger
with me.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.159
And an actor.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.787
A joke? Okay,
what a sick joke.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.122
Why would you do
something like that?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.833
Um, because Vince thought
that it would be funny?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.293
Stupid Vince.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.380
Yeah, I tried to tell him.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.050
Not cool, Vinnie. Not cool.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.385
Hey, five minutes ago,
you two were all into this.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.262
[both muttering]

01:37.972 --> 01:40.016
How could you do this to me?

01:40.099 --> 01:41.518
What? We used to do stuff
like this to each other

01:41.601 --> 01:43.895
all the time.
I get you, you get me.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.189
Six months ago, you would've
found this hi-larious.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.691
Okay, well, you know what?
I've responsibilities now.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.860
I mean, this is my office.
I'm working.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.155
You're always working.
That's all you ever do now.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.657
Don't you think
it's interesting

01:55.740 --> 01:57.951
that ever since
you broke up with Ben

01:58.034 --> 02:00.328
you're working
all the time now, Holly?

02:00.411 --> 02:02.372
Are you trying to avoid
something or someone?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.165
- Oh, you know what, Vince.
- Exactly.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.543
You're trying to avoid Vince.
What's the problem, Holly?

02:06.626 --> 02:08.127
I thought we were gonna go back
to being friends.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.839
- We are friends.
- How? I never see you.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.715
Every time I call you,
you're busy.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.051
Every time we're supposed
to do something, you gotta work.

02:15.134 --> 02:17.178
I mean, before this whole
you broke up with Ben

02:17.262 --> 02:18.888
'cause you liked me,
but you couldn't trust me

02:18.972 --> 02:21.266
because Tina threw herself
at me, blah blah, blah

02:21.349 --> 02:22.725
we used to have so much fun.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.019
Oh, my God,
you are so wrong.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.730
My working a lot has nothing
to do with you.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.233
Blah, blah, blah. God.
You have such a big ego.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.527
"And Tina threw herself at you?"

02:32.610 --> 02:35.363
I said so many other

Hey, Vince,
what's going on, dude?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.536
- Can't talk.
- Oh, well.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.788
Looks who's avoiding who now.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.540
We got a big problem, dude.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.459
I came home, there's
a padlock on our door

03:29.542 --> 03:30.627
with an eviction notice.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.961
What?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.254
Wexler's kicking us
out the apartment.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.006
- Wait, what?
- Oh, my God.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.966
The notice said the neighbors
have been complaining

03:37.050 --> 03:38.384
about excessive noise.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.595
Man, you gotta stop
dancing to "Soul Train."

03:42.472 --> 03:45.099
You know, very often,
if you sleep with the landlord

03:45.183 --> 03:47.352
he will rip up
the eviction notice.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.648
And also,
you get to have sex.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.318
Look, man,
Wexler is crazy, man.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.819
We didn't do anything wrong.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.780
We gotta get ourselves
a good lawyer, man.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.615
Oh, you guys, I have
a really good lawyer

04:00.698 --> 04:04.535
that we use down in our office.
I don't know if it'll help.

04:04.619 --> 04:08.581
"The Law Offices of Suck It,
Eat It and In Your Face?"

04:08.665 --> 04:10.208
Gotcha.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.584
[laughs]

04:11.668 --> 04:14.253
- Here's the key to the padlock.
- What?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.755
I did it. I put
the eviction notice up.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.926
- You? You did that?
- Yeah. I did it.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.679
- This was a joke?
- Yes. Oh, my God, dude.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.555
You should've seen
the look on your faces.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.684
You were all, "Dude,
we're being evicted."

04:27.767 --> 04:30.520
Well, look who's doing
the fun dance now?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.480
Whoo! Yeah!

04:34.148 --> 04:37.026
Holly, that is a horrible
thing to do.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.861
Are you kidding me?

04:38.945 --> 04:41.072
That was hi-larious!

04:41.155 --> 04:42.699
- Up top!
- I'm back!

04:42.782 --> 04:44.367
You're welcome back.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.036
Val, this is what
friends do.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.746
Cupcakes on me, suckers.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.166
Okay, explain to me
what was fun

04:52.250 --> 04:54.210
about convincing them
that they were evicted?

04:54.293 --> 04:56.087
Well, Val, it was a joke.

04:56.170 --> 04:59.465
You know, from the Latin
hardy-har?

05:01.342 --> 05:03.386
Well, I just don't think
that's funny at all.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.054
Oh, well,
of course, you don't.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.640
'Cause you're a big bore,
yes, you are.

05:08.307 --> 05:09.392
What?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.477
Honey, don't go getting
all offended.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.229
I meant it in a good way.

05:13.312 --> 05:17.025
Wh-where is the good
in you're a big bore?

05:17.108 --> 05:18.651
I said it all cute.

05:20.361 --> 05:23.906
But, hey, I wish that I was
as sensible and reliable

05:23.990 --> 05:26.951
and dependable
and trustworthy and..

05:27.035 --> 05:28.995
[snores]

05:29.078 --> 05:34.584
Oh, I'm sorry. But, hey, those
are some damn solid qualities.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.128
Are you saying
that I'm a bore?

05:37.211 --> 05:38.504
Honey, don't make me
say it again

05:38.588 --> 05:40.798
or else I'm gonna put
myself back to sleep.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.595
You know what? I don't
wanna be a bore.

05:45.678 --> 05:50.516
I wanna be fun and wild and
spontaneous and wicked crazy.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.436
Really? Okay.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.189
Oh, God. No. We're not
opening a whorehouse.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.944
Hey, guys, there was
an eviction notice on our door.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.446
- We know. Holly.
- Yeah, we know.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.989
I needed my guitar
and I couldn't get

06:05.073 --> 06:06.824
into the apartment,
so I went down to Wexler

06:06.908 --> 06:08.618
and he denied that he did it
and we ended up

06:08.701 --> 06:11.079
getting into this huge fight,
and he called immigration on me.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.372
- What?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be deported.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.250
Oh, my God, Ben,
I-I'm so sorry.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.461
- But I did it.
- What?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.797
I-I put the eviction notice up.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.882
You know, for funny?

06:22.965 --> 06:26.469
Oh, no, this isn't happening.
Holly, you think this is funny?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.679
They're gonna send me back
to England.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.224
God. I can't even
look at you right now.

06:31.307 --> 06:33.559
Oh, Ben, man, hold up, man.
What..

06:37.271 --> 06:38.648
Oh, my God,
what did I do?

06:38.731 --> 06:40.108
O-okay, I gotta go
talk to him.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.486
No, no, no, Holly, Holly,
let him cool off.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.446
We'll call you later.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.032
What am I gonna do?

06:48.116 --> 06:50.326
Sweetie, I am sure there is
someone at immigration

06:50.409 --> 06:52.703
that Ben can sleep with.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.293
[all laughing]

07:01.712 --> 07:04.132
- Did you see her face?
- You were brilliant.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.842
Really? I thought I went
a little over the top

07:05.925 --> 07:08.886
with the "God, I can't even
look at you right now!"

07:08.970 --> 07:11.973
No, no, no, man, you were
totally Judi Dench in there.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.811
What? Can't a brother enjoy
the "Masterpiece Theatre?"

07:18.104 --> 07:19.522
So I still don't get
how you were so sure

07:19.605 --> 07:21.190
that it was Holly who put up
the eviction notice.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.693
When I saw Will Wexler's
name signed

07:23.776 --> 07:26.571
with Holly's famous
little circles over the I

07:26.654 --> 07:27.864
I knew it was her.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.449
She tried to pull one
over on us.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.368
- We are the masters.
- Yes, we are.

07:33.953 --> 07:37.373
You know, guys, I actually feel
a little bit bad about this.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.500
- Are you serious?
- No, I was acting.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.378
[all laughing]

07:57.476 --> 07:58.728
If they think
they can get us

07:58.811 --> 08:02.064
with that fake deportation
thing, I don't think so.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.691
Wow, you're really into this.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.652
I know, I forgot how much fun
Vince and I used to have

08:06.736 --> 08:08.404
doing mean things
to each other.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.072
Do you remember when I got him
those big pants

08:10.156 --> 08:12.617
and convinced him
he was shrinking?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.744
Three doctors.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.078
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.580
Sorry I took
a long lunch hour

08:17.663 --> 08:19.081
but I thought I'd do
something a little wild

08:19.165 --> 08:21.459
a little wacky,
totally off the charts.

08:21.542 --> 08:25.129
- Like my new purse?
- Ooh, you crazy mofo.

08:25.213 --> 08:29.258
Yeah, I thought maybe I needed
something to go with that.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.927
Come see, come see!

08:31.010 --> 08:33.763
Goodbye, hatchback.
Hello, Porsche.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.807
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

08:36.890 --> 08:38.976
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, I know!

08:39.059 --> 08:40.727
Oh, my..
Oh, we're done.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.440
Who's not fun now?
I am wild.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.776
I'm crazy.
I've got torque, baby.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.403
Val, I can't believe
you did this.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.781
I know. I mean, here,
I always thought

08:51.864 --> 08:54.033
that you were a stuffy
and responsible lady

08:54.116 --> 08:59.163
but inside you are just a fat,
middle-aged man with a ponytail.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.959
Hey, what's up?
Why'd you want to see us?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.795
Oh, guys, oh, I've got
some big news to tell you.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.339
So why don't you go in
and sit down?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.719
Watch and learn
from the genius.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.601
Ben, oh, my God,
I feel so horrible

09:20.685 --> 09:22.311
about this whole
deportation thing.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.231
It-It's okay. We're gonna
hide Ben underground.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.649
We're gonna change
his name to Rajeeb

09:26.732 --> 09:28.442
and get him a job
as a taxi driver.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.321
Quick. How much from Kennedy
Airport to Midtown?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.365
[Indian accent]
$45. Should I take
Midtown Tunnel?

09:35.574 --> 09:37.285
Ben, you don't have
to do that

09:37.368 --> 09:39.203
because Tina and I have been
on the internet all afternoon

09:39.287 --> 09:40.454
and we found a solution.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.831
Yeah, it turns out
all Ben has to do

09:41.914 --> 09:43.165
is marry an American citizen.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.917
That way he can stay
in the country.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.796
And since this whole thing
was kinda my fault

09:48.879 --> 09:50.131
Ben..

09:53.342 --> 09:55.303
...will you marry me?

09:57.013 --> 09:59.140
[both laughing]

09:59.223 --> 10:00.182
Why are you laughing?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.518
Oh, because that's, really sweet

10:02.601 --> 10:04.645
but I could never ask you
to do something like that.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.147
Well, Ben, I have to.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.857
I mean, I feel so horrible
about this whole thing.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.483
Besides, when I called
immigration--

10:09.567 --> 10:12.528
What, you called immigration?
She called immigration for real.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.031
But when I gave them
your name

10:15.114 --> 10:16.365
and all your information,
they had no record--

10:16.449 --> 10:18.409
Why would you do that?

10:18.492 --> 10:20.119
My tourist visa
is about to expire.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.496
This is gonna red flag me.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.415
Do you know how hard it is
to get back in this country

10:24.498 --> 10:25.708
once they kick you out?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.043
It could be years.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.754
I don't wanna go back.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.673
So, uh, what I'm thinking
is that we go to city hall

10:32.757 --> 10:34.508
first thing in the morning
and just get married.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.093
Yeah.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.804
You guys wouldn't
go on a honeymoon

10:38.888 --> 10:40.014
or anything, would you?

10:40.097 --> 10:41.349
Oh, they have to,
they have to be

10:41.432 --> 10:43.434
convincing
to the immigration people.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.728
That's really sweet
of you, Holly.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.230
Ow! What's that for?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.775
I don't like
where this is going.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.612
[both laughing]

10:54.695 --> 10:57.156
You were so great! Oh, my God,
did you see Ben freak out?

10:57.239 --> 11:00.201
Yeah, I've never actually seen
somebody's hair get scared.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.378
Gary, why are you smiling?

11:10.461 --> 11:12.922
Oh, 'cause this day just got
a whole lot better.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.801
[laughs]

11:23.808 --> 11:26.769
Oh, great, some old lady
is trying to parallel park

11:26.852 --> 11:28.687
in front of my car.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.357
Nice driving, Miss Daisy.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.567
Cut your wheel,
cut your wheel!

11:35.027 --> 11:36.320
That's it.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.952
I knew these babies
would come in handy.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.245
What are you doing?

11:44.328 --> 11:46.455
Protecting my investment.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.499
See, these cones will act
as a perimeter.

11:48.582 --> 11:51.293
One ding
and my fun vehicle depreciates.

11:52.670 --> 11:56.465
Okay, um, sweetie,
why did you buy this car?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.676
For fun. For torque.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.011
For good times.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.305
Oh, God. My knees
are starting to hurt.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.766
You know what that means?
It's gonna rain.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.812
Help me put up the lid.
Come on, hurry, hurry.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.814
It smells like a nor'easter.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.111
Oh, God, little-little girl

12:17.194 --> 12:19.196
you're getting awfully close
with that ice cream to the car.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.532
Do you not see the perimeter
of my fun vehicle?

12:23.617 --> 12:25.744
Well, oh!

12:29.248 --> 12:31.167
Are you okay?

12:36.589 --> 12:37.798
Can you believe her?

12:37.882 --> 12:39.175
She actually thought
she could trick us

12:39.258 --> 12:41.093
after we tricked her
after she tricked us

12:41.177 --> 12:43.095
after we tricked her.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.513
So, wait, I'm confused.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.099
Are we tricking her now
or is she tricking us?

12:47.183 --> 12:49.310
We're tricking her,
my little Englishman.

12:50.811 --> 12:51.854
[knock on door]

12:51.937 --> 12:54.148
Okay, game faces on.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.031
Hey, I got your message.
What's so important?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.449
I was picking out
my wedding dress.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.367
Shh, shh, shh.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.244
Okay, well, uh, thank you
for e-mailing

13:07.328 --> 13:08.871
the immigration forms,
Mr. Ramirez.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.206
Who is Mr. Ramirez?

13:10.289 --> 13:11.749
Oh, that's the immigration guy

13:11.832 --> 13:14.001
who's been assigned
to Ben's and your case.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.169
What?

13:15.252 --> 13:16.420
Yeah, Ben wanted
to make sure he had

13:16.504 --> 13:18.088
all the proper paperwork
for the wedding.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.257
What? What?
Ben, Ben, get off the phone.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.218
Okay, well, my, my bride
just got here

13:22.301 --> 13:24.762
so I'll fill her in,
and Mr. and Mrs. Ben Sheffield

13:24.845 --> 13:26.514
will be in your office
on Monday.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.016
Okay, why did you call
immigration?

13:29.099 --> 13:30.809
Now they know about you.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.561
They already knew.
You told them, didn't you?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.980
Right, yes, yeah, I-I did that.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.069
Oh!

13:43.072 --> 13:46.158
Hey, hey, Tina,
where are you going?

13:46.242 --> 13:47.952
I'm scared.
This isn't fun anymore.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.996
What? You're scared?
Do you realize what's happening?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.706
All I wanted to do
was be friends with Vince

13:52.790 --> 13:54.875
and now I have to marry Ben.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.252
I mean, why did you tell me

13:56.335 --> 13:57.753
that they were faking
in the first place?

13:57.836 --> 13:59.755
- It's all your fault.
- It's my fault?

13:59.838 --> 14:02.967
Okay, fine, I forgive you.
Just tell me what to do.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.095
Just, just calm down, okay?
Look, you'll marry him

14:06.178 --> 14:07.555
and then, you'll stick it out
for a couple of weeks

14:07.638 --> 14:08.889
and then you'll have it
annulled.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.933
So I only have to do it
for a couple weeks?

14:11.016 --> 14:13.435
- A month, tops.
- Oh, okay.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.812
Well, I can do this, right?

14:14.895 --> 14:16.188
I mean, it'll help Ben

14:16.272 --> 14:18.065
and what's a few weeks
out of my life, right?

14:18.148 --> 14:19.441
Yeah, and you get
to have sex.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.735
Tina, I am not having sex
with my husband.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.614
It's like
you're already married.

14:32.329 --> 14:35.791
Oh, you were right.
This is so much fun.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.960
We didn't go anywhere.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.462
Yeah, but you could feel
the torque, right?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.715
Come on, Val,
just around the block.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.466
No, but, but the potholes.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.093
The potential nor'easter.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.096
Alright, you know what?

14:49.179 --> 14:50.848
Give me the keys, 'cause you
cannot have this car.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.891
No! What? What do you mean
I can't have this car?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.518
I'm having so much fun in it.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.061
This is not fun.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.316
It's not?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.192
No, it's horrendous.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.779
I am having
a horrible, horrible time.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.659
Listen, Val, some people
are cut out for torque

15:10.743 --> 15:14.121
and some people
are cut out for...dork.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.333
Okay? You just have
to embrace who you are.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.461
- A dork?
- A big dork.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.048
So I'm never gonna be fun?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.968
Well, that sucks.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.347
I thought maybe this
one time I could just..

15:31.430 --> 15:32.598
...whoop it up!

15:34.016 --> 15:35.976
You can't, Val.
You just can't.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.395
But I hereby give you
permission to go back

15:38.479 --> 15:41.482
to being the sensible,
wise, reliable

15:41.565 --> 15:43.942
obsessive neurotic
we all love and adore.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.238
But, Lauren, I bought this cool
convertible and I thought--

15:48.322 --> 15:50.366
Go back, Val.
Just go the hell back.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.829
<i>[instrumental</i>
<i>"Here Comes The Bride"]</i>

15:58.499 --> 16:00.709
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

16:00.793 --> 16:05.047
'to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.'

16:05.130 --> 16:08.217
She makes such
a beautiful fake bride.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.551
Dude, you've got to love it.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.720
She looks like she's totally
freaking out.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.516
Ben, do you take Holly
to be your lawful--

16:15.599 --> 16:18.519
Hold it! Oh, thank God,
I made it in time.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.730
Val, I can't believe you came.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.482
You said that this wedding
was an abomination

16:23.565 --> 16:25.150
in the eyes of God.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.070
Dude, we gotta speed this up.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.697
My shift at Kinko's
starts in an hour.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.242
Look, I've been thinking
about what you're doing

16:33.325 --> 16:36.078
and even though
I may not agree with it

16:36.161 --> 16:37.996
I have to say
I am very proud of you

16:38.080 --> 16:39.164
for doing the right thing.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.083
Oh, thanks, Val.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.043
You brought a guest?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.922
I'll go defrost
some more burritos.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.259
Everyone,
this is Reverend Marshall

16:50.342 --> 16:52.970
'from the little brown church
on 34th Street.'

16:53.053 --> 16:54.596
Amen, Reverend, amen, amen.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.266
Yes, so, I was thinking

16:57.349 --> 16:59.268
since you guys are going
to go through with this

16:59.351 --> 17:01.395
we should at least make it
a nice memory, you know?

17:01.478 --> 17:03.939
Not just have some justice
of the peace marry you.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.398
No offense.

17:05.482 --> 17:09.069
But, um, the kind reverend
has agreed to do the honors.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.945
[laughs]

17:11.029 --> 17:12.448
Do you want to tell them
or should I?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.157
Knock yourself out.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.161
Val, listen, there's something
we got to tell you and Holly.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.579
This whole
immigration thing--

17:18.662 --> 17:20.455
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.625
I know my sister, and she's not
great with details.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.919
Since I am, I wanted
everything to be legal

17:26.002 --> 17:29.298
so I stopped by immigration,
I got all the proper forms

17:29.381 --> 17:31.300
and gave them all
the necessary information.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.470
Oh, my God, you gave them
my information?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.805
Yes, of course. Ben, my sister's
about to do something

17:36.889 --> 17:38.307
that is not exactly kosher

17:38.390 --> 17:39.933
and I really wanted
just to make sure--

17:40.017 --> 17:42.186
- I-I have to marry her?
- He really has to marry her.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.687
You really have
to marry him?

17:43.771 --> 17:46.440
Yeah, I mean, guys, what did
you think we were doing here?

17:46.523 --> 17:48.567
But, relax,
it's only for a few weeks.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.236
No, no, no, honey, legally,
you have to live together

17:51.320 --> 17:52.696
as a married couple
for a year.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.114
(all)
What?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.449
Yeah, they check up on you.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.034
Guys, this isn't a game.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.660
I knew you wouldn't
read the forms.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.746
- 'Um, shall we begin?'
- Yes, yes come.

18:00.829 --> 18:05.709
Um, we, Ben, um, I'm sorry,
but I can't do this for a year.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.462
Yeah, Holly, I know, but they're
gonna kick me out. I..

18:08.545 --> 18:10.672
Leave her out of it!
Gary will marry you!

18:10.756 --> 18:12.549
I'll drive you up to Vermont.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.512
No, okay, listen, Ben,
I'm sorry.

18:16.595 --> 18:20.349
I mean, I really wanna help you,
but I just, I can't do this.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.810
But we'll find
another way, I swear.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.938
Gotcha.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.690
- What?
- Gotcha.

18:31.235 --> 18:35.197
It was all a joke! Fake papers,
fake minister, it was all me!

18:35.280 --> 18:37.282
Ha, I gotcha!

18:44.081 --> 18:48.877
[screams]
I made a joke.
A big gotcha joke.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.547
Okay, so no one at immigration
knows anything about me?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.382
No, I didn't tell them.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.550
Then who's that guy?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.844
I sell cologne at Barney's.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.014
[laughs]
See, who's the funny one now?

19:01.098 --> 19:03.809
Me. Val. Why?
'Cause I gotcha. How?

19:03.892 --> 19:05.144
Because of Gary's big mouth

19:05.227 --> 19:07.354
all on the phone
with Vince at the bakery.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.773
Yeah. See, I don't need
a Porsche to be fun.

19:09.857 --> 19:14.278
I gotcha.
I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.989
Oh, it's exhausting
being funny.

19:19.199 --> 19:22.744
Yeah, um, Val,
that was, uh, real funny.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.163
Yeah, you got us good, Val.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.498
Woo-hoo.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.672
But, guys.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.215
I-I gotcha.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.759
Whew! I almost had
to marry Ben, girl.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.762
Imagine, telling my mama
I was gonna marry a white man.

19:43.223 --> 19:46.351
Wait, no, I-I was just
being funny, you guys.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.478
It's okay when you do it,
but when I try--

19:48.562 --> 19:50.439
(all)
Gotcha!

19:51.189 --> 19:52.274
Oh, no.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.283
You gotta admit,
I almost got you.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.952
Yeah, well,
Val got us all.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.413
It's always
the pretty unfunny ones.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.789
Yeah.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.751
Yeah, but, you know,
some good did come from this.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.795
I got to have fun
with my friend again.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.007
- I missed you, Vince.
- I missed you too.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.387
Holly, will you marry me?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.017
What?

20:29.561 --> 20:31.605
Got ya! Oh!

20:31.688 --> 20:32.814
Face.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.858
[laughs]
You so thought I meant it.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.234
No, I so did not.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.361
You so did and you were
gonna say yes too--

20:37.444 --> 20:39.446
No, I wasn't. You're so stupid.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.822
- Oh, I'm stupid?
- Yeah, you're stupid.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.408
Look at your stupid pants.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.576
They are pretty loose.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.913
Yeah, wander
if they're shrinking.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.414
You, I went to three doctors--

20:49.498 --> 20:52.000
I know! I got you the most!
I'm the best!
