04:06.747 --> 04:08.664
Your Majesty.

04:11.543 --> 04:15.004
-Gentlemen.
-Your Majesty.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.797
What's this?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.008
The Valor Ecclesiasticus.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.637
The results of the investigations
into the wealth and practises...

04:22.804 --> 04:25.640
...of all the religious houses
in Your Majesty's kingdom.

04:25.807 --> 04:30.686
It lists the treasures, the wealth,
the vast private lands...

04:30.854 --> 04:34.482
...of the monasteries, priories
and other religious establishments.

04:34.650 --> 04:38.861
It as well lists
the innumerable cases of laxity...

04:39.071 --> 04:43.991
...corruption, evil practise and fraud
which have flourished unchecked...

04:44.159 --> 04:46.452
...and in some cases
for hundreds of years...

04:46.620 --> 04:49.330
...in these same institutions.

04:55.963 --> 05:00.049
Meanwhile, Majesty,
your own treasury is much depleted.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.676
Is it not a thing to marvel at?

05:01.843 --> 05:04.845
The richness of those who ought,
by right, to be your subjects?

05:05.013 --> 05:09.392
And the poverty and debt
of the English Crown?

05:12.479 --> 05:14.105
It is indeed.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.586
George?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.757
-Sir Henry.
-Your Majesty.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.260
I came again to pay court
to Lady Sheldon...

05:44.428 --> 05:46.095
...with the king's permission.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.264
-Yes. Yes, of course.
-l--

05:48.432 --> 05:50.766
I also wanted an opportunity
to express...

05:50.934 --> 05:53.561
...my love and devotion
to Your Majesty.

05:53.729 --> 05:56.772
As a reformer myself,
I know all the good works you do...

05:56.940 --> 06:00.526
...without ever seeking any praise
but always deserving it.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.614
When I visit religious houses,
I do so to urge those inside...

06:05.782 --> 06:09.910
...to cleanse and purify
their corrupt lives and doctrine.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.455
Or else they will surely
be destroyed.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.791
Yes. Yes, it's true.

06:15.959 --> 06:20.171
We Evangelicals must
breathe new life into dead bones...

06:21.298 --> 06:24.800
...and encourage the ignorant
to believe in the priority of faith...

06:24.968 --> 06:26.385
...and the word of God.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.307
I see we understand each other,
Sir Henry.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.144
Lady Sheldon...

06:36.646 --> 06:39.940
...Sir Henry Norris
has come courting.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.489
My lord.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.742
Madam.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.416
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.175
I had the dream again.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.302
-Anne.
-l told you...

07:08.678 --> 07:11.263
...l am her death and she is mine.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.808
-For God's sake.
-So long as they are both alive...

07:13.975 --> 07:15.142
...l can't be safe.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.189
Why doesn't Catherine just die?
Everyone tells me how ill she is.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.857
-Why doesn't she die?
-Stop it.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.360
I had a thought.
The next time Henry goes abroad...

07:24.528 --> 07:27.279
...l shall be left as regent.
I can order their deaths.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.448
You're crazy. Stop it.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.117
Stop it!

07:34.871 --> 07:36.038
Listen to me.

07:36.206 --> 07:40.376
You're the Queen of England.
For the love of God, act like it.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.882
After all, you were a lady
to Queen Catherine.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.801
You saw and heard
how she behaved.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.804
It seemed to me she never betrayed
her real feelings.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.557
Can you not be more like her?

07:57.144 --> 07:59.645
-More like Catherine?
-Yes.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.564
You heard me.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.233
At least seem happy.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.569
Not a heap of misery.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.432
Father Abbot.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.434
What is it, Brother John?

08:38.602 --> 08:40.769
A letter from the king.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.773
We are to be suppressed.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.902
By the orders of Mr. Cromwell.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.404
I don't understand.
Give me the letter.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.454
What have we done, Father?

08:58.622 --> 09:00.539
I don't know.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.209
What is to become of us?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.901
Will you ask
the French ambassador again...

09:29.069 --> 09:31.820
...if Francis will not relent
and agree...

09:34.407 --> 09:36.492
...to the marriage of Elizabeth
to his son?

09:37.285 --> 09:40.162
-l might.
-Well, don't you think it's important?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.831
And don't you think
your daughter is important?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.917
-Of course l do.
-Well, then I--

09:45.085 --> 09:47.002
Surely you understand
Francis' refusal...

09:47.170 --> 09:50.506
...to agree to the marriage
in the first place was insulting.

09:51.967 --> 09:55.928
-Do you want me to go back and beg?
-No, of course not.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.310
Sweetheart...

10:03.478 --> 10:05.479
...it's been tasted.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.773
It's not poisonous.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.446
Fact of the matter is...

10:15.115 --> 10:17.950
...it might be better to pursue
an alliance with the emperor.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.620
-And that would suit Catherine.
-lt has nothing to do with Catherine.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.125
It has to do with England.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.044
And England's interests.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.797
After all...

10:31.965 --> 10:34.800
...l am supposed to be
concerned with that.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.566
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.653
You have no reason to be.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.491
You care for our daughter,
as you should.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.001
But leave the greater things
to my care.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.963
Do you understand?

11:25.935 --> 11:29.188
What a pleasure to have you and
your lovely wife to sup, Your Grace.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.274
So tell me, you are suppressing
some religious houses?

11:32.442 --> 11:35.152
I am starting to, yes.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.488
And what else? No.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.824
I am intending to abolish
almost all the holy days...

11:40.992 --> 11:43.452
...that fall during the law terms
and the harvest.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.955
This enforced holidays,
they damage the country's economy...

11:47.123 --> 11:51.168
...stop vital works, and in fact
they also impoverish workers.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.003
And the priests?

11:53.171 --> 11:56.840
As far as the clergy are concerned,
we mean to issue a set of injunctions...

11:57.008 --> 11:59.051
...requiring them to preach
the Supremacy.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.513
There will be an injunction requiring
parents and employers to teach...

12:02.680 --> 12:04.348
...their children and servants...

12:04.516 --> 12:07.309
...the Lord's Prayer, Creed
and the Ten Commandments...

12:07.477 --> 12:09.311
...in English rather than Latin.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.313
All clerics will be put on notice...

12:11.481 --> 12:14.983
...to attack the superstitious cults
surrounding images and relics.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.821
They'll be told it profits their souls
to bestow upon the poor and needy...

12:18.988 --> 12:21.490
...what they would currently
waste on relics.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.410
That's very good, gentlemen.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.329
But allow me to chide you.

12:27.705 --> 12:31.375
I don't think that you are going
far enough or fast enough.

12:33.336 --> 12:39.133
-Your wife is a great radical, Thomas.
-She is. And illegal.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.220
Two reasons to hide her.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.181
Being carried around in a box
does not make you laugh.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.019
My dear, I am sorry about that.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.022
I'm not your dear.
I'm nobody's dear.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.234
I'm a woman and l demand
equal respect for my ideas.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.737
For me, the practises
of the Catholic Church are evil.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.616
The way people are kept in total
ignorance and made to feel guilty...

13:04.784 --> 13:07.202
...about their own bodies
and their own thoughts.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.581
And, even worse,
the idea that the rich can buy...

13:10.748 --> 13:13.083
...a plot in heaven for their souls.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.545
I agree with you. The Catholic Church
is corrupted, it's irredeemable.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.547
Then you should
smash and destroy it...

13:18.715 --> 13:21.550
...utterly and totally and without pity.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.761
That is my advice to you,
Mr. Cromwell.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.895
Now you can put me back in my box.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.232
Good evening, Your Grace.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.401
Good evening, Mr. Secretary.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.209
We're ready.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.230
Why are you here, Thomas?

14:16.773 --> 14:19.816
To see the degradation
that we have been forced to?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.652
No.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.115
I don't like to see it.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.785
I wonder why you stay here.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.496
Why don't you come back to court?

14:33.831 --> 14:35.958
I love the queen.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.878
Nothing in this world
would make me leave her.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.798
I am a Catholic.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.300
I believe in my faith.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.637
Perhaps you poets
don't believe in anything.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.640
In love, perhaps.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.894
You may kiss me.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.356
Then you will leave me alone.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.149
Forever.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.048
Elizabeth.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.370
Sir?

15:55.913 --> 16:01.126
Oh, forgive me. l should have
warned you of my impending visit.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.296
-Who are you?
-My name is John Leland.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.089
I am His Majesty's librarian.

16:07.884 --> 16:11.470
You keep a library in the priory,
I believe.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.765
We do indeed, Mr. Leland.

16:14.932 --> 16:19.561
It contains many fine and old
manuscripts and texts.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.897
We're very proud of it.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.110
The king has commissioned me
to peruse and diligently search...

16:27.278 --> 16:29.571
...all libraries belonging
to religious houses...

16:29.739 --> 16:31.907
...about to be suppressed.

16:33.451 --> 16:37.788
He is anxious to preserve
all their literary treasures.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.958
You mean you intend
to remove them from here?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.168
Naturally.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.421
They will be housed
in the royal libraries.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.425
-But--
-His Majesty has also ordered me...

16:50.593 --> 16:53.679
...to find texts that would emphasise
the Royal Supremacy...

16:53.888 --> 16:55.889
...and the new monarchy.

16:56.307 --> 17:01.436
I do not think, Mr. Leland, that you
will find many such texts here.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.410
Your Majesty?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.664
Elizabeth.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.917
Oh, my own heart.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.503
Ma. Mama.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.047
Hello.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.136
You may leave us now, Lady Bryan.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.474
My dear girl, my sweetheart.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.728
-Have you missed me?
-Yeah.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.479
You missed me?

17:44.647 --> 17:45.856
I missed you.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.191
So much.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.737
Oh, let me go with you.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.365
Where? Show me. Show me where.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.326
-Here.
-Here? They stopped here?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.996
Mama will watch you
feed the fishies.

18:01.164 --> 18:05.208
-Where?
-There and here.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.336
I see them.

18:08.504 --> 18:12.507
I see them. l see the fishies.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.968
Where do you see fishies,
my darling?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.682
My lord.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.688
Have you talked
to the queen recently?

18:26.856 --> 18:30.025
-Yes.
-She's giving me cause for concern.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.903
The king is not so much
in love with her as he used to be.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.030
-What's wrong with her?
-l don't know.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.199
Perhaps she's afraid.

18:37.742 --> 18:41.745
Poor George.
Have you gone soft-headed?

18:41.913 --> 18:44.790
-Me? No.
-l hope not.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.751
You see, George,
the stakes are too high.

18:47.919 --> 18:52.047
Whoever is a coward now will soon
rue the day and regret his misfortune.

18:52.215 --> 18:56.551
Successful people
only recognise fear in others.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.721
Go and talk to your sister again.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.436
-Feeling better?
-Much, thank you.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.771
-Ladies.
-My lord.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.898
My Lord Boleyn.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.123
Is this not better, George?

19:27.291 --> 19:29.084
Much better.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.588
-Yes.
-Will you dance, my lord?

19:33.756 --> 19:35.590
No, not now.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.180
Wine, my lord.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.769
All this time
and you're still in love with her.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.439
You're wrong, my lord.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.985
My love is sprung
and spent a long time ago.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.663
Anne!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.334
Go!

20:14.839 --> 20:17.132
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

20:17.300 --> 20:21.678
Your Majesty.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.607
Mark.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.614
Play a volta.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.777
I want to conceive again.

23:25.029 --> 23:28.406
I want to conceive a son.

23:33.871 --> 23:37.665
A son to be the living image
of his father.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.005
But l can't.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.717
Why?

23:48.094 --> 23:51.721
As long as they're alive,
I can't conceive a son.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.351
What are you saying?

24:00.689 --> 24:03.399
Catherine and her daughter.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.448
Are you saying
you want me to kill them?

24:47.111 --> 24:48.903
Mary?

24:49.238 --> 24:50.905
Is it you?

24:55.411 --> 24:58.413
-Elizabeth.
-Madam.

24:59.915 --> 25:05.587
I have not seen my daughter
for more than four years.

25:05.963 --> 25:09.132
Is it not cruel of them
to keep her from me?

25:09.300 --> 25:11.676
Gentle madam, yes.

25:11.927 --> 25:15.013
It burns my heart.

25:19.602 --> 25:24.272
Read the curia's judgement
to me again. Please.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.333
"We pronounce that the marriage...

25:43.500 --> 25:46.669
...between Henry VlII
and Catherine of Aragon...

25:46.837 --> 25:49.797
...stands firm and canonical...

25:49.965 --> 25:55.511
...and their issue still stands
lawful and legitimate."

26:08.692 --> 26:10.652
You see...

26:11.528 --> 26:14.656
...this is the eternal truth...

26:14.865 --> 26:18.868
...which no man can ever deny.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.670
Holy Father, Eminencies.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.506
The next item for our deliberation--

26:32.007 --> 26:34.008
Alessandro.

26:34.677 --> 26:36.678
Let me look at you.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.847
Well, well, well, how you've grown.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.850
You're almost a man.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.437
Are you honest and clean?

26:46.605 --> 26:47.855
Sì, Grandfather.

26:48.023 --> 26:51.025
When you pray to God,
are you truly humble?

26:51.193 --> 26:52.694
Sure.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.698
Good boy.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.577
Off you go.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.914
He'll make a fine cardinal.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.417
Don't you think?

27:13.382 --> 27:15.717
Monsignors, we have
other business to discuss.

27:15.884 --> 27:19.304
First, I have invited the sculptor
Michelangelo...

27:19.513 --> 27:22.557
...to paint a Last Judgment
in the Sistine Chapel.

27:22.725 --> 27:23.933
Holy Father...

27:24.435 --> 27:27.395
...there are still people
who object to his work on the ceiling.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.731
I know. I did myself.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.232
But now l like it.

27:31.525 --> 27:35.570
-Won't the Judgment be expensive?
-No. We won't pay him very much.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.739
He's only an artist, after all.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.827
What of the King of England's
great matter?

27:44.955 --> 27:47.749
I will tell you a story.

27:48.125 --> 27:52.086
Once, when l was a boy,
I went swimming.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.922
And the tide carried me away...

27:55.090 --> 27:58.968
...far from the shore,
into the deepest water.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.971
It was then I prayed aloud to God...

28:02.139 --> 28:06.559
...and a friendly wave came
and pushed me back to the shore.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.520
So it is with the King of England.

28:09.688 --> 28:14.484
He has been carried far from
the shore, but he does not know it.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.820
He does not ask for God's help.

28:17.988 --> 28:21.032
He does not ask for our help.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.118
He thinks he can swim alone.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.454
But very soon he will realise...

28:26.622 --> 28:30.625
...he is not swimming but drowning.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.842
Why are you crying like a baby?

28:40.010 --> 28:43.137
These are nothing but idols.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.533
Father, who are these men?

29:03.700 --> 29:07.537
Bretons, from France. Huguenots.

29:07.704 --> 29:08.746
-Protestants?
-Yes.

29:09.373 --> 29:13.042
Perhaps Mr. Secretary Cromwell
felt that he couldn't trust Englishmen...

29:13.210 --> 29:16.712
...to destroy their own heritage
and besmirch their own faith.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.345
The queen.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.180
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

29:26.348 --> 29:27.682
Your Majesty.

29:27.850 --> 29:33.688
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.858
-Excuse me, Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.901
I came to see the king.

29:39.736 --> 29:44.198
Madam, His Majesty left this morning
to go hunting with the Duke of Suffolk.

29:44.366 --> 29:47.702
And other nobles.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.162
Suffolk?

29:49.538 --> 29:50.913
Yes, madam.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.963
I remember now, he told me.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.771
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.732
Your Majesty.

30:17.900 --> 30:21.402
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.071
Your Majesty.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.294
A good kill.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.755
Do you want to go back
to the palace?

30:40.964 --> 30:44.634
No. Is there somewhere
around here we can stay?

30:45.260 --> 30:47.261
There's Wulfhall.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.347
Wulfhall.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.681
Who owns that house?

30:50.849 --> 30:53.476
Sir John Seymour and his family.

30:54.228 --> 30:57.271
I remember Sir John.
He was in France with us.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.446
Let's go surprise him.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.839
Sir John!

32:05.007 --> 32:06.507
Hey!

32:06.675 --> 32:08.676
Sir John!

32:09.553 --> 32:12.555
-Sir John!
-Who is this shouting?

32:12.723 --> 32:15.182
Sir John,
you have an unexpected guest.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.732
-Your Majesty.
-Sir John.

32:22.899 --> 32:26.235
You are most welcome.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.919
Amen.

33:46.817 --> 33:49.443
Your Majesty must forgive
the tardiness of my kitchen.

33:49.611 --> 33:52.446
I think I'm very well looked after,
Sir John.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.658
The duke and l were reminiscing
about the French campaign.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.368
Yes.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.037
It was a shame we only fought
one battle against them.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.872
But what a battle.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.666
I remember how we charged
at them...

34:03.834 --> 34:08.003
...with His Grace leading the vanguard
with tremendous bravery.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.965
And how the French were broken
and routed in the charge...

34:11.133 --> 34:12.717
...and fled the field before us.

34:12.926 --> 34:15.302
And all we saw were their spurs.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.639
I must tell Your Majesty, the Milanese
ambassador was amazed by you.

34:19.182 --> 34:22.560
He said to me, "The king was fresher
after his exertion than before.

34:22.853 --> 34:25.855
I do not know how he can stand it."

34:31.945 --> 34:34.238
To past victories.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.033
Sir John.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.344
Mary?

34:58.180 --> 34:59.221
Oh, Mary.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.475
My daughter.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.937
Oh, sweetheart. Sweetheart.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.481
Is it you?

35:09.065 --> 35:12.777
Don't weep. Don't weep.
Let me look at you.

35:12.986 --> 35:14.528
There you are.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.531
I have not seen you for so long.

35:18.033 --> 35:21.869
An eternity. And here you are.

35:23.038 --> 35:26.582
Oh, my sweet child.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.585
My beloved child.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.796
My angel.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.507
My world.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.717
Mary.

35:46.019 --> 35:48.312
She was here.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.397
She came to me.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.150
Yes, madam.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.402
I know.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.951
Let me summon a doctor for you.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.621
No. I don't want a doctor.

36:05.789 --> 36:09.959
I have wholly committed myself
to the pleasure of God.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.925
May the omnipotent God...

36:18.093 --> 36:20.469
...have mercy upon you...

36:21.054 --> 36:22.763
...and forgive you your sins.

36:22.931 --> 36:27.768
And may Jesus Christ
lead you to eternal life.

36:42.951 --> 36:45.661
Oh, Mark, l'm so sad.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.497
Why sad?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.958
If l had a son....

36:52.878 --> 36:57.965
If l had a son,
it would bring about a golden world.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.819
None of us had seen
a sea of mud like that before.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.321
I didn't know what to think.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.824
When your horse sank up
to his hindquarters in it...

37:23.992 --> 37:26.076
...l shall never forget your face.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.038
What was I supposed to do?
I was in full armour.

37:29.205 --> 37:33.208
Yeah? Well, you hadn't
had that before.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.005
Your Majesty,
may I present my daughter...

37:38.173 --> 37:40.507
...Lady Jane Seymour.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.251
Jane.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.432
Your Majesty?

38:32.227 --> 38:34.103
Mr. Secretary Cromwell is here.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.442
Madam.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.611
You wished to see me?

38:43.822 --> 38:45.656
My father tells me
you are determined...

38:45.824 --> 38:49.743
...to close every religious house
in England. Is it true?

38:50.328 --> 38:51.578
Yes.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.999
As Your Majesty knows,
the Church commissioners found...

38:55.208 --> 38:58.752
...that fraud, laxity and abuse
were commonplace.

38:58.920 --> 39:03.632
Yet some religious houses received
good report. ls that not also true?

39:06.594 --> 39:09.638
I also hear that all the wealth
and assets of the monasteries...

39:09.806 --> 39:13.142
...are to be transferred
to the king's treasury.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.270
Indeed. l intend to make the king
the most powerful...

39:16.438 --> 39:18.480
...and the richest king in Europe.

39:18.648 --> 39:23.527
But surely some of that wealth
could be put to better uses.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.612
Better uses, madam?

39:25.780 --> 39:30.159
Yes. For endowments to charitable
and educational causes...

39:30.618 --> 39:32.995
...which even Wolsey did.

39:34.998 --> 39:38.959
Madam, I am surprised to hear you
question the king's policy...

39:39.127 --> 39:41.837
...which your father and brother
wholeheartedly support.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.507
I question the policy, Mr. Secretary,
because l am not convinced...

39:45.675 --> 39:47.634
-...that it is the king's.
-Madam, l--

39:47.802 --> 39:51.388
You are far too highhanded,
Mr. Cromwell.

39:52.307 --> 39:56.143
You ought to be careful
or l will have you cropped at the neck.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.805
I know that I must die.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.017
I ask that my debts be cleared...

40:37.185 --> 40:39.436
...and my servants be
recompensed...

40:39.604 --> 40:44.191
...for the good service
they have done for me.

40:46.069 --> 40:50.948
I wish to be buried
in the convent of the Observant Friars.

40:51.199 --> 40:56.578
And l would wish that 500 Masses
be said for my soul.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.915
And that someone would visit...

41:00.083 --> 41:03.043
...Shrine of our Lady
of Walsingham...

41:03.211 --> 41:06.130
...to pray on my behalf.

41:08.550 --> 41:11.593
For my daughter, Mary...

41:12.345 --> 41:15.973
...l leave my collar of gold...

41:16.141 --> 41:18.767
...l brought from Spain.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.563
And my furs.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.900
Madam, let me help you.

41:28.111 --> 41:31.655
Thank you,
my loyal and loving Elizabeth.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.159
I must write to the king.

41:39.080 --> 41:44.793
My lord and dear husband...

41:45.503 --> 41:48.255
...l commend me unto you.

41:49.591 --> 41:53.677
The hour of my death
draws fast on...

41:53.887 --> 41:56.305
...and my case being such...

41:57.473 --> 42:00.309
...the tender love I owe you...

42:00.476 --> 42:05.772
...forces me to put you
in remembrance of the health...

42:06.149 --> 42:09.276
...and safeguard of your soul...

42:11.613 --> 42:14.156
...which you ought to prefer...

42:14.324 --> 42:18.785
...above all considerations
of the world of flesh whatsoever...

42:18.953 --> 42:23.207
...for which you have cast me
into many miseries...

42:23.416 --> 42:26.126
...and yourself into many cares.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.545
For my part...

42:29.297 --> 42:33.008
...l do pardon you all.

42:33.176 --> 42:39.681
Yea, and l do wish
and pray dearly, God...

42:39.849 --> 42:42.684
...he will pardon you also.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.522
For the rest...

42:48.191 --> 42:52.861
...l commend unto you
our daughter, Mary...

42:53.696 --> 42:58.075
...beseeching you to be
a good father unto her...

42:58.368 --> 43:02.329
...as l have always desired.

43:04.832 --> 43:07.000
And lastly...

43:08.711 --> 43:10.879
...l vow...

43:12.048 --> 43:16.218
...that mine eyes desire you...

43:16.886 --> 43:19.846
...above all things.

43:50.712 --> 43:53.422
Elizabeth, help me.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.297
Madam.

45:17.465 --> 45:19.466
What is it, Nan?

45:30.186 --> 45:32.854
Now I am indeed queen.

45:51.165 --> 46:07.722
Elizabeth?

46:14.355 --> 46:16.064
Oh, Jesus.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.746
Elizabeth.

48:00.503 --> 48:02.379
Happy May Day, dear cousin.

48:02.547 --> 48:05.799
And to you, happy May Day.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.843
Sir John, this is my wife, Catherine.

48:09.011 --> 48:10.887
-Sir John, how do you do?
-Catherine.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.640
-Right.
-That's the winner.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.691
Here comes His Majesty now.

48:27.655 --> 48:28.863
My lady.

48:29.031 --> 48:31.199
-Your Majesties.
-Your Majesties.

48:32.994 --> 48:34.536
Your Majesties.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.581
Go watch the cockfight, sweetheart.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.001
-My lady.
-My lady.

48:41.836 --> 48:44.212
Not performing today, Mark?

48:45.881 --> 48:47.716
No, not today, my lord.

48:48.426 --> 48:49.926
But perhaps later tonight.

48:51.679 --> 48:53.388
I'm not sure.

48:57.685 --> 48:59.853
Have you told her about me?

49:00.563 --> 49:02.188
About us?

49:02.356 --> 49:03.398
-No.
-Why the hell not?

49:03.566 --> 49:05.734
You're George Boleyn.
You're a god around here.

49:05.901 --> 49:08.403
If you could read Greek,
Master Smeaton...

49:08.571 --> 49:12.073
...you would know that even the gods
had problems with their wives.

49:14.744 --> 49:16.870
Take the ribbon.

49:30.051 --> 49:31.593
Sir John.

49:31.761 --> 49:32.969
Your Majesty.

49:33.137 --> 49:36.389
We wanted to thank you once more
for your generous hospitality.

49:36.557 --> 49:38.975
All the more so because our visit
was so unexpected.

49:39.143 --> 49:41.978
Sire, it was the greatest possible
privilege and pleasure.

49:42.146 --> 49:47.233
And the room Your Majesty slept in
shall be known as the king's bedroom.

49:47.735 --> 49:51.571
Your daughter, Jane, should come
to court as a lady to Her Majesty.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.365
Thank you, Your Majesty.

49:53.908 --> 49:55.659
You do our family great honour.

49:58.454 --> 50:01.623
Sweetheart. Come here.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.798
My Elizabeth.

50:11.092 --> 50:12.926
Oh, guards, guards, protect me.

50:14.887 --> 50:17.639
Yeomen! En garde.
You're going to the Tower.

50:17.807 --> 50:20.183
Protect me. Protect your king.

50:20.393 --> 50:22.477
-Mama.
-Elizabeth.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.444
My papa.

50:32.113 --> 50:34.447
My Elizabeth.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.330
Thanks.

50:43.499 --> 50:44.999
Anne.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.170
Yes, Father.

50:49.338 --> 50:52.006
I have heard some reports
which alarm me.

50:52.174 --> 50:54.300
What reports?

50:54.468 --> 50:57.804
It seems you have quarrelled
with Mr. Cromwell.

50:57.972 --> 51:01.683
We disagreed on an important
and public issue.

51:01.851 --> 51:03.351
Anne...

51:03.519 --> 51:06.813
...l did not bring you up
to have opinions or to express them...

51:06.981 --> 51:09.315
...or to quarrel with those closest
to the crown.

51:09.483 --> 51:12.652
But l am closest to the crown.
I am the king's wife.

51:12.820 --> 51:15.488
And you should remember
how you got there.

51:17.992 --> 51:20.493
I know how l got there.

51:20.661 --> 51:23.079
And it was not all you.

51:23.330 --> 51:26.166
It was not all you or Norfolk
or George...

51:26.333 --> 51:29.335
...or any other man
you want to name.

51:30.212 --> 51:33.089
It was also me.

51:33.758 --> 51:37.552
He fell in love with me.
He respected me.

51:40.347 --> 51:42.682
And my opinions.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.442
What is it?

51:52.610 --> 51:54.694
You have no need to worry.

51:54.862 --> 51:56.863
There is good news all round.

51:57.031 --> 51:59.866
Catherine is dead.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.702
And l....

52:04.914 --> 52:07.874
I am pregnant.

52:08.501 --> 52:10.752
Do you understand?

52:11.879 --> 52:16.758
I am carrying the king's son.

52:24.308 --> 52:28.603
We are on the edge
of a golden world.

52:32.399 --> 52:35.068
Happy May Day, Your Majesty.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.779
Your Majesty.
