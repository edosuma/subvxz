00:00.033 --> 00:01.333
She came into the house?

00:01.400 --> 00:04.867
Yeah. She started, like,
walking up the stairs.

00:04.934 --> 00:07.533
and I was, like, "Hello?"
Like, "How can I help you?"

00:07.600 --> 00:10.433
And she was, like... She, like,
followed us around the house.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.333
Try telling me without
using the word "like."

00:14.400 --> 00:15.900
Okay. [laughs]

All rise! Court come to order!

00:50.767 --> 00:52.100
Have a seat, please.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.700
Hello, Judge. We have case #1020,
McDermott versus Gallimore.

00:56.767 --> 00:58.400
[Judy]
Thank you.

00:58.467 --> 01:01.200
This case is a relatively simple one.

01:01.266 --> 01:04.700
Miss McDermott, you want
your money back that you paid

01:04.767 --> 01:09.734
for the use of an Airbnb
that the Defendant owns, it's a home.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.867
You're gonna tell me why
you want your money back.

01:11.934 --> 01:16.133
You didn't use it and spend the night.
I gather that what you were doing

01:16.200 --> 01:19.767
was feting your daughter
for her 17th birthday. Is that right?

01:19.834 --> 01:21.467
[Melissa]
Yes, Your Honor.

01:21.533 --> 01:24.800
How did you find Mr. Gallimore's
house to rent?

01:24.867 --> 01:28.700
Through the website Vrbo. It's ki--
It's similar to an Airbnb website,

01:28.767 --> 01:31.934
where they list their properties
and you can filter through them

01:32.000 --> 01:33.333
to figure out what you want.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.400
[Judy] Did you get a contract
from the Defendant?

01:36.467 --> 01:38.166
-I did.
-May I see it, please?

01:38.233 --> 01:39.533
[Melissa]
Of course.

01:42.266 --> 01:43.300
Mm-hmm.

01:50.533 --> 01:53.233
[Judy] Is this the only contract
that you signed?

01:53.300 --> 01:54.433
Yes, Your Honor.

01:54.500 --> 01:58.266
Okay. So, this is what happened.
You were planning just an evening stay.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.967
How many friends were you having?

02:00.100 --> 02:01.533
Four, I wanna say.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.266
[Judy]
And you arrived after the girls arrived?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.266
That is correct.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.967
[Judy] And that was from Saturday to
Sunday or Friday to Saturday?

02:08.033 --> 02:10.700
It was going to be Friday through Sunday,
was the booking.

02:10.767 --> 02:14.934
And earlier in the booking process,
when I requested to book his property,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.467
you have to kind of describe what you
wanna do there, and I wouldn't have--

02:17.533 --> 02:20.433
[Judy]
I-I don't care about anything other than

02:20.500 --> 02:23.467
what is in this contract.

02:23.533 --> 02:28.667
This contract now encompasses everything
because it's written,

02:28.734 --> 02:32.367
it has every element that exists
between the two of you...

02:32.433 --> 02:33.433
[Melissa]
Yes, ma'am.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.233
...and cannot be changed in any way,
other than in writing

02:37.300 --> 02:38.834
and signed by both parties.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.133
'Cause that's what it is
when you have a contract.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.166
Now, I assume, Mr. Gallimore,
that you're going to tell me

02:44.233 --> 02:46.500
-that this lady, who is your neighbor...
-[Terry] Yes.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.600
-is going to tell me what happened...
-Yes.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.667
on that Friday, which is the 30th.

02:50.734 --> 02:52.033
Would you step up, please?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.934
-Tell me your name.
-Rochelle Webber.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.266
Miss Webber, you're
a next-door neighbor to Mr. Gallimore.

03:00.333 --> 03:03.967
-Yes.
-You recall October the 30th of last year?

03:04.033 --> 03:05.300
-Yes.
-[Judy] Tell me

03:05.367 --> 03:09.800
about what time in the day you noticed
that there were people

03:09.867 --> 03:12.200
entering Mr. Gallimore's house.
He wasn't at home.

03:12.266 --> 03:13.900
Around 5:30.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.100
Tell me what you observed.

03:15.166 --> 03:18.500
There was, it looked like
a bunch of young girls

03:18.567 --> 03:21.166
that were going into
the front door of his house.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.700
Other than the fact that
they were five young girls,

03:23.767 --> 03:26.166
there wasn't anything untoward
about their conduct?

03:26.233 --> 03:28.734
-Uh, no. They were just giggling...
-[Judy] They were just five young girls.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.633
...and doing what girls do, on their
phones and that type of thing.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.233
Right. So, what did you do?

03:33.300 --> 03:37.667
-So, about the same time that I--
-I don't want you to editorialize at all,

03:37.734 --> 03:40.333
-[Rochelle] Okay.
-I just want you to tell me what you did.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.934
Well, I looked out my window and I sh--
I usually leave my windows open,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.800
'cause they-- But I shut my window
because there was gonna be people

03:46.867 --> 03:48.200
that were staying there and I didn't wanna

03:48.266 --> 03:50.800
-have to deal with the noise. So...
-Whatever.

03:50.867 --> 03:53.233
Whatever. So far, they weren't
making any noise,

03:53.300 --> 03:56.700
they were five young girls going
into the house at 5:30 in the afternoon.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.266
-Yes.
-[Judy] So, what did you do?

03:58.333 --> 04:01.734
So, I just, I-- Like I said,
I shut my window and everything.

04:01.800 --> 04:06.367
At that same time, when I saw them,
Mr. Gallimore sent me a text

04:06.433 --> 04:09.767
saying that somebody entered his house
without an adult,

04:09.834 --> 04:13.400
did I see adults, by chance,
did I see anybody coming into the house?

04:13.467 --> 04:17.900
Okay. So, what he did was text you first.
You didn't call him?

04:17.967 --> 04:20.333
-No.
-Okay. Go ahead.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.867
So, he sent me a text and said,

04:22.934 --> 04:25.467
"I have people that are gonna be
staying in the house,

04:25.533 --> 04:29.500
and it's just young girls,
there's no adults there."

04:29.567 --> 04:31.467
-Okay.
-"Would you please go over there

04:31.533 --> 04:36.567
because I can't have underage kids
staying in my property, you know, it's--"

04:36.633 --> 04:39.033
-Whatever. Is that what he said to you?
-[Rochelle] Yes.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.567
Don't make things up.
Is that what he said,

04:41.633 --> 04:44.400
"Would you please go over there,
I can't have underage people..."

04:44.467 --> 04:47.767
Yes. "I don't want to have underage
people staying in my property,"

04:47.834 --> 04:49.400
and see if there's an adult there.

04:49.467 --> 04:52.900
That's what he wanted to know, if there
was an adult that had actually shown up,

04:52.967 --> 04:55.066
-So... Okay.
-Go ahead. So you went over there...

04:55.133 --> 04:57.700
So I went over there and,
um, I knocked on the door

04:57.767 --> 05:01.734
and I knocked again. And I knew
people had entered into the house,

05:01.800 --> 05:04.166
so, I didn't know if they were
ignoring me, or whatever.

05:04.233 --> 05:07.834
And then, the door was unlocked,
and I opened up the door,

05:07.900 --> 05:11.567
and I said, "Hello?" And then,
all these girls came down from upstairs,

05:11.633 --> 05:13.700
-'cause it's a two-story house.
-[Judy] Mm-hmm.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.200
They all came down from upstairs.

05:15.266 --> 05:17.066
-And?
-And that's when I said,

05:17.133 --> 05:18.266
"Is your mom here,

05:18.333 --> 05:21.900
or the person who's supposed to be
on the contract staying here?"

05:21.967 --> 05:25.200
and one of the young girls said,
"No, she's not."

05:25.266 --> 05:28.500
And I said, "Well, then you
can't be in the house right now,

05:28.567 --> 05:30.500
because you're supposed to be
with the person

05:30.567 --> 05:32.300
who had signed the contract and
everything

05:32.367 --> 05:33.934
to be in the house with them and stuff."

05:34.000 --> 05:35.533
-Is that what you told them?
-Yes.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.433
-[Judy] Is that what he told you to do?
-Yes.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.166
-Is that what you told her to do?
-Yes.

05:39.233 --> 05:40.467
Okay. And they left?

05:40.533 --> 05:45.000
Well, they had some things that they had
put into the garage, and everything,

05:45.066 --> 05:47.734
So, they gathered up their things,
and everything.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.200
-So the girls drove? Did they drive in--
-They drove.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.233
-Yes.
-In two cars?

05:51.300 --> 05:53.633
There was just one car
I saw behind the house.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.166
-Okay.
-And they put their stuff in the car,

05:56.233 --> 06:00.333
and stuff like that, and I just said, "Oh,
you guys might wanna move your car,"

06:00.400 --> 06:02.900
because their car was kinda
parked over a line

06:02.967 --> 06:06.667
that you're not supposed to park over.
You can get a parking ticket or get towed

06:06.734 --> 06:10.734
in the area, 'cause our area's pretty
picky about how you park, and everything.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.400
And so, I was just mentioning to that and,

06:13.467 --> 06:15.367
'cause I didn't think they
were gonna leave.

06:15.433 --> 06:18.934
'Cause they could've hung out until their
person came, and stuff like that.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.667
-[Judy] Hung out where?
-They coulda just sat in their car.

06:21.734 --> 06:24.500
They coulda hung out on the patio
in front of the house, or whatever,

06:24.567 --> 06:26.700
I didn't tell them they had to
leave the property, I just said

06:26.767 --> 06:29.600
they couldn't be in the house,
because that's what Mr. Gallimore said.

06:29.667 --> 06:32.900
They couldn't be in the house.
And so, I had just made comment about,

06:32.967 --> 06:36.400
oh, you guys might wanna move your car,
and at that point, one of the girls says,

06:36.467 --> 06:38.900
"Oh, well, we're probably gonna
go to Walmart, anyways."

06:38.967 --> 06:41.900
So, I assumed that they were leaving.

06:41.967 --> 06:43.633
-I don't care what you assumed.
-Well.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.500
-[Judy] And is that all that you know?
-Yes.

06:45.567 --> 06:48.033
-Okay. And they left?
-I didn't hang out there

06:48.100 --> 06:50.333
to watch their car drive away,
I went back to my house.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.100
-[Judy] They left.
-Because I did what I was asked to do,

06:53.166 --> 06:57.800
and I was done. I wasn't gonna sit there
and babysit them, or anything. So, yeah.

06:57.867 --> 07:00.834
-You left. Okay.
-Yeah, I did. Yeah.

07:02.734 --> 07:03.867
Tell me what happened.

07:03.934 --> 07:07.667
I turned around the corner, and
she started, like, walking up the stairs,

07:07.734 --> 07:10.433
and I was, like, "Hello?"
Like, "How can I help you?"

07:10.500 --> 07:12.834
And she was, like,
"You guys can't be here--"

07:12.900 --> 07:16.200
Try-Try-- Try telling me
what you're gonna tell me

07:16.266 --> 07:17.800
without using the word "like."

07:38.667 --> 07:42.266
Mr. Gallimore, I want you to
take a look at this contract.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.667
Here you go, sir.

07:50.033 --> 07:53.734
And I want you to show me,
because I may be missing it,

07:53.800 --> 07:58.033
where in that contract it gives you
the authority, once you receive the money,

07:58.100 --> 08:00.867
and they've leased the property--
I may have missed it--

08:00.934 --> 08:04.367
To force anybody to eject them
from the property?

08:04.433 --> 08:05.867
It's not in the contract.

08:05.934 --> 08:08.667
If it's not in the contract,
unless you have another contract...

08:08.734 --> 08:10.767
Well, there's something that
she has to sign,

08:10.834 --> 08:13.333
before she can even get the contract,
stating that--

08:13.400 --> 08:15.500
-Okay, I'm gonna take a look at it.
-[Terry] Okay.

08:15.567 --> 08:19.867
Before you got the contract, was there
another document that you had to sign?

08:19.934 --> 08:22.867
No. There's a-- On the website,
you request the property

08:22.934 --> 08:26.166
and it gives details of the property,
and there's nothing that you s--

08:26.233 --> 08:28.166
I don't recall signing anything for that.

08:28.233 --> 08:30.367
Well, he says he has something
that's signed from you.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.600
-Well, it's not signed. They have to--
-Just a-- No, no, no, no. Sir--

08:33.667 --> 08:37.433
They have to check-off on this before
they can even get a lease agreement

08:37.500 --> 08:39.700
saying that they agree to these terms.

08:39.767 --> 08:42.033
If they don't read this and
agree to the terms,

08:42.100 --> 08:45.033
-they don't get a contract.
-[Judy] I don't know-- Just a second.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.166
-I don't know that.
-Okay.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.033
That may be true, but I don't know that.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.266
So, if you want to lease to somebody,

08:50.333 --> 08:52.433
and I assume you've been
doing this for awhile,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.734
-Yes.
-[Judy] and you have a contract,

08:54.800 --> 09:00.300
and you specifically want to incorporate
something specifically in that contract,

09:00.367 --> 09:05.033
that requires somebody over the age
of 25, over the age of 40,

09:05.100 --> 09:09.600
over the age of 26, to be there,
it has to be in your contract.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.967
And the only way to modify your contract
is something in writing.

09:13.033 --> 09:14.867
And what you're trying to tell me is,

09:14.934 --> 09:18.066
in order for her
to even look at your property,

09:18.133 --> 09:21.700
she has to agree to terms,
I-I'm assuming this,

09:21.767 --> 09:24.467
and one of the terms is that there
has to be an adult there

09:24.533 --> 09:27.133
-who's over the age of 25, or 26,
-Yes.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.667
and then, if she presses a button
that says agreed...

09:30.734 --> 09:33.033
-Yes.
-[Judy] ...and then you send her a lease.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.233
-Right?
-Yep.

09:34.300 --> 09:37.433
Now, is everything that is contained

09:37.500 --> 09:41.900
in that overall application for a lease

09:41.967 --> 09:44.033
-contained in your lease?
-No.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.333
-[Judy] Does it contain an amount?
-Uh, no.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.200
So, you put in the amount.
Does it contain a date?

09:49.266 --> 09:51.834
-Yes.
-So, that application contains a date.

09:51.900 --> 09:55.066
-The date that they agreed to it.
-[Judy] Right, and that's incorporated

09:55.133 --> 09:56.433
-in your lease.
-[Terry] Yes.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.667
[Judy]
Does it contain who will be present?

09:58.734 --> 10:01.233
-No. It just--
-[Judy] No. You have to adopt it

10:01.300 --> 10:03.300
and put it in your lease.

10:03.367 --> 10:07.600
Does it contain terms that
you will not create noise,

10:07.667 --> 10:11.000
and any noise after 10:00 p.m.,
you will be ejected

10:11.066 --> 10:13.567
and forfeit your deposit.
Did it contain that?

10:13.633 --> 10:15.467
-No.
-And you put that in your lease.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.367
-Yes.
-So, there are some things that you

10:17.433 --> 10:20.367
put in your lease and some things
that you didn't put in your lease.

10:20.433 --> 10:22.667
-Correct.
-But in the only signed agreement

10:22.734 --> 10:26.567
that you have, Mr. Gallimore,
you did not indicate

10:26.633 --> 10:32.300
that someone had to be over 25,
or over 26, or over 24,

10:32.367 --> 10:34.700
in order to ask for an application.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.133
I'm just telling you that
for future reference.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.266
Now, nothing that you heard
suggested any untoward behavior

10:42.333 --> 10:44.433
-when you went to the house.
-No.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.834
You didn't hear screaming, loud music,
the girls were quiet, they were upstairs.

10:48.900 --> 10:52.500
You came in, you actually
opened the door to a premises

10:52.567 --> 10:56.233
that you had no right to go into
because it had been leased premises.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.367
I mean, whether the door was open--
You didn't mean the door was open,

10:59.433 --> 11:01.467
-you meant the door was unlocked.
-Yes.

11:01.533 --> 11:04.200
Okay. Well, you had to open the door
in order to go in.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.200
-[Rochelle] Yeah.
-And when you opened the door,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.867
-you had to say, "Hello?"
-Yes.

11:08.934 --> 11:12.934
You didn't have to scream hello
because there was loud music blaring.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.934
-No.
-Nothing. The girls were upstairs...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.500
-Yes.
-...putting their things away.

11:16.567 --> 11:20.533
And when you said, "You can't be
in the house," were those your words?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.300
-Um, yes.
-Okay.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.934
-Tell me your first name.
-Samantha.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.500
-Samantha, do you remember Miss Webber?
-I do.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.700
Do you remember what happened
when she came into the house?

11:32.767 --> 11:34.100
-I do.
-Tell me what happened.

11:34.166 --> 11:38.533
We all unpacked our stuff from our car
and put it in the garage,

11:38.600 --> 11:41.467
and then we went upstairs and
were just checking out the rooms,

11:41.533 --> 11:44.567
and deciding where we wanted
to go eat for dinner.

11:44.633 --> 11:47.800
And none of us heard the door open.
All we just heard was

11:47.867 --> 11:52.066
someone say hello, like she said,
and I turned around the corner,

11:52.133 --> 11:54.500
and she started, like,
walking up the stairs

11:54.567 --> 11:56.066
and I was, like, "Hello?" like,

11:56.133 --> 11:57.567
-"How can I help you?"
-No.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.767
And she was like,
"You guys can't be here--"

11:59.834 --> 12:02.633
Try-Try-- Try telling me
what you're gonna tell me

12:02.700 --> 12:04.633
without using the word "like."

12:04.700 --> 12:07.100
Okay. [laughs] Um,

12:07.166 --> 12:11.600
she said, "You guys can't be here."
She said we were disrupting her dinner,

12:11.667 --> 12:14.133
that we were disrespectful
for being there.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.266
-No, I was not having dinner.
-[Judy] Shh-shh, just a second.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.567
-Don't interrupt her.
-Okay.

12:19.633 --> 12:23.367
I asked her if I would be able
to call my mom and sort it out.

12:23.433 --> 12:26.767
She said there was no point,
there was no one over the age of 25 there.

12:26.834 --> 12:28.667
There was no reason--
We could not be there,

12:28.734 --> 12:30.767
that he had a very strict policy
about that.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.567
She, like, followed us around the house,
asked us where the keys were.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.834
Told us that we, like, needed to leave,

12:37.900 --> 12:41.033
that I couldn't park my car there,
that it needed to be moved.

12:41.100 --> 12:44.734
And then, I said, "Okay, we're leaving,"
and she was like, "I'll wait,"

12:44.800 --> 12:48.300
and, like, watched us as we grabbed all of
our stuff and put it back in my car,

12:48.367 --> 12:51.533
and before I could say another word,
she just closed the garage on us.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.400
And then, when I realized that I had
left some stuff in there,

12:54.467 --> 12:57.567
like a birthday sash that I had left,
I went around and tried to go back,

12:57.633 --> 13:00.233
'cause the door was unlocked,
and at that point, it was locked

13:00.300 --> 13:03.066
-and we could not get back in.
-And where did you go, Samantha?

13:03.133 --> 13:07.166
To a parking lot, like, really about,
probably 100, 200 feet away from

13:07.233 --> 13:10.333
the Airbnb, just the nearest parking lot
we could find, to figure out--

13:10.400 --> 13:12.200
-[Judy] What to do.
-What to do, yeah.

13:12.266 --> 13:13.767
Okay, and this was about 5:30?

13:13.834 --> 13:15.700
I would say around that point, yeah.

13:15.767 --> 13:18.066
And that's what you indicated, about 5:30?

13:18.133 --> 13:20.200
Yes. I did not tell them to leave, though.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.166
-I didn't ask you anything else.
-Okay.

13:22.233 --> 13:24.800
-I just said it was about 5:30.
-Yes.

13:24.867 --> 13:29.400
And that was about the same time that you
received a phone call from Mr. Gallimore.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.500
-It was a text message.
-Or a text message.

13:31.567 --> 13:33.033
-Yes. Yes.
-About 5:30.

13:33.100 --> 13:37.867
Okay, now, how far, Miss McDermott,
is where you are

13:37.934 --> 13:39.266
to where the house was?

13:39.333 --> 13:42.233
I'd say probably 50 miles,
45 to 50 miles.

13:42.300 --> 13:46.367
So, at that hour, at that time,
it probably took you

13:46.433 --> 13:48.934
an hour, an hour and 15 minutes
to get there?

13:49.000 --> 13:52.600
But when I got the call from her, frantic,
when they were told to leave,

13:52.667 --> 13:56.133
-Yeah. It was a quarter to six.
-I had to take care of a few things,

13:56.200 --> 13:59.633
and then I got in the car and was probably
there in about an hour and 15 minutes.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.600
-[Judy] And she called you at work?
-I had just gotten home from work.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.967
When you say you had
just gotten home from work,

14:05.033 --> 14:08.600
-so, from your house to where it was.
-That's correct.

14:08.667 --> 14:12.300
-It was about an hour and a half.
-And work and my house are same area.

14:12.367 --> 14:16.133
Okay. Just, for my own information,
what did you go home for?

14:16.200 --> 14:19.266
I still had to get some stuff together,
pack, and then,

14:19.333 --> 14:22.567
I was going to possibly have my fiancée
drive me down there

14:22.633 --> 14:24.700
and drop me off,
so we only had the one car,

14:24.767 --> 14:27.100
but at the time I got her call,
he couldn't leave then,

14:27.166 --> 14:30.500
-so I just took off down there.
-[Judy] At the time you got the call,

14:30.567 --> 14:33.400
-he couldn't leave where?
-Originally, he was going to

14:33.467 --> 14:36.266
drive me down there. We were considering
him driving me down there

14:36.333 --> 14:39.166
and dropping me off,
but when I got the call from her--

14:39.233 --> 14:42.667
[Judy] Oh, so that you were going
to wait for him to drop you off.

14:42.734 --> 14:46.667
-Correct, correct.
-Okay, and he was delayed at work.

14:46.734 --> 14:48.900
-Correct.
-[Judy] What time did your fiancée

14:48.967 --> 14:51.200
-get home from work?
-I don't know exactly what time,

14:51.266 --> 14:54.166
but he was arriving about the time
that I just decided to leave

14:54.233 --> 14:56.600
and head down once I found out
they were in the parking lot.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.533
No, then he would have driven you
because you would've been very upset.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.233
So, he wasn't home when you left?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.900
As I recall, he was just getting home
and I was leaving.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.834
That doesn't sound right to me. [chuckles]

15:05.900 --> 15:09.467
'Cause I do, now that I recall,
I was on the phone with Terry

15:09.533 --> 15:12.533
after I got her call, when my fiancée
walked in the front door.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.567
Any reason why he didn't accompany you?

15:14.633 --> 15:16.633
I just went. I was ready to go
at that point.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.567
[Judy]
Hm, not so sure. In any event,

15:18.633 --> 15:22.667
you had called the Defendant
to let the Defendant know

15:22.734 --> 15:24.734
that the girls were coming that day.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.333
That is correct. I left him
a text message and I said that,

15:27.400 --> 15:30.033
if traffic went well, they should
arrive in about an hour.

15:30.100 --> 15:33.066
He said he would unlock the door.
And then, once they got there,

15:33.133 --> 15:35.800
my specific text message is,
"The girls arrived.

15:35.867 --> 15:38.133
I'm still at work and will be
heading down after."

15:38.200 --> 15:40.667
-Um, I have a copy of that.
-I'd like to see it.

15:40.734 --> 15:42.700
There's multiple here.

15:42.767 --> 15:46.367
And then, that's when I did not hear from
him again, he stopped responding.

15:46.433 --> 15:49.200
And about ten minutes later,
I got the call from Samantha

15:49.266 --> 15:50.834
saying the neighbor had came in.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.266
Samantha, did there come a time
that you went back

15:57.333 --> 15:59.834
-to sit on the patio of the house?
-Yes, we did.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.433
Okay. And these were texts back and forth?

16:02.500 --> 16:05.934
Yes. She texts and says, "We will be
arriving in about an hour,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
-if traffic goes well."
-No. No, no, no, no.

16:08.066 --> 16:09.734
[theme music playing]

16:11.166 --> 16:13.633
-You want your deposit back.
-Yes.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.533
-Which was how much?
-It was the actual cost of the rental,

16:16.600 --> 16:19.066
-which was $1180.
-Which she already got back,

16:19.133 --> 16:21.133
-by the way.
-Did you get your money back?

16:21.200 --> 16:25.166
-So, at the--
-Ju-Just-- That's an either yes or a no.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.467
[theme music playing]

16:36.567 --> 16:39.600
[narrator] <i>Melissa McDermott</i>
<i>is accusing Terry Gallimore</i>

16:39.667 --> 16:42.500
<i>of ruining her daughter's</i>
<i>17th birthday party</i>

16:42.567 --> 16:46.000
<i>by having Melissa's daughter</i>
<i>removed from his property.</i>

16:46.066 --> 16:49.633
You wrote to her and said--
This was after your neighbor

16:49.700 --> 16:52.033
had already told them
to get out of the house,

16:52.100 --> 16:53.433
-and locked the house.
-Right.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.300
The girls went to a parking lot but they
were frightened to be there,

16:57.367 --> 17:00.300
it was getting late, and you texted her
and you said,

17:00.367 --> 17:04.433
"My neighbor let me know that the girls
are sitting on the private patio

17:04.500 --> 17:09.367
and that's okay. Please let me know
when you arrive at the property. Thanks."

17:09.433 --> 17:12.633
Now, you're responding to him
and you're not there yet.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.400
-Correct.
-[Judy] So I would like to know

17:14.467 --> 17:17.767
how you're texting him
when you're driving in the car.

17:17.834 --> 17:21.000
-I-I just did.
-[Judy] You texted him,

17:21.066 --> 17:22.700
you want me to know,

17:22.767 --> 17:26.033
"I didn't like the fact that they were
forced to sit in a parking lot alone

17:26.100 --> 17:29.200
in an unfamiliar territory,
so I told 'em to go and sit there."

17:29.266 --> 17:33.667
And then you wrote, "I'm ten minutes out,
the girls are now on their cars,"

17:33.734 --> 17:35.266
I assume you meant in their cars,

17:35.333 --> 17:36.767
-because they were freezing.
-Right.

17:36.834 --> 17:41.900
And then you write back, "You are more
than welcome to stay at the house.

17:41.967 --> 17:44.600
The neighbor does not have
keys to the house."

17:44.667 --> 17:47.100
-That was hours later, after we had--
-[Judy] Just a second.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.934
"I'm sorry, Terry, I will be having
to find a hotel.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.367
I don't want to have to worry about having
to lock the door at all times

17:54.433 --> 17:57.834
to prevent a stranger from entering.
The keys are on the counter

17:57.900 --> 18:01.867
and the door is locked. Again, if you
do not understand why we have chosen

18:01.934 --> 18:05.433
not to stay, and do not want to
refund of my money,

18:05.500 --> 18:08.667
I won't have a choice but to
seek reimbursement in court.

18:08.734 --> 18:11.734
Again, I'm sorry about your mother
and wish her the best."

18:11.800 --> 18:13.133
What happened with your mother?

18:13.200 --> 18:14.867
-She was in the hospital.
-[Judy] Okay.

18:14.934 --> 18:16.734
So, you must have had a conversation

18:16.800 --> 18:19.567
intervening here, because you were
annoyed at him...

18:19.633 --> 18:21.800
-Very.
-...but yet, you must have said something

18:21.867 --> 18:23.367
about your mother and it was--

18:23.433 --> 18:25.734
We ke-- We had several conversations
on the phone.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.467
I told her, I go,
"You're more than welcome

18:27.533 --> 18:29.133
to stay at the house
when you get there.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.533
I'll get you in the house,
but you need to be there.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.166
I can't let five girls
stay at the house by themselves."

18:34.233 --> 18:36.533
By the way, when you were
speaking to her on the phone...

18:36.600 --> 18:39.100
-[Terry] She was at home.
-[Judy] ...she had gotten home already.

18:39.166 --> 18:40.500
-Yes.
-[Judy] With the girls.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.133
No, she was at her house,
the girls were still in Newport.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.967
-Oh, is that right?
-That was the first conversation we had

18:46.033 --> 18:48.233
right after I got the frantic call
from my daughter

18:48.300 --> 18:50.166
saying she was told to leave
by the neighbor.

18:50.233 --> 18:51.834
I got on the phone with Terry and said,

18:51.900 --> 18:53.867
"What just happened?
Why didn't you just call me?"

18:53.934 --> 18:56.333
Just a second.
What time was it that you called her?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.433
We had several-- Any time
between 6:30 and almost 8:00.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.333
[Melissa]
I can tell you the exact time.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.934
Yeah, give me the exact time that you were
still talking to him from your house.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.533
I got the call from Samantha at 5:48.
I tried calling him at 5:55,

19:08.600 --> 19:11.033
5:59, 6:01 is when I actually
got on the phone with him.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.600
Okay. When were you still at home
when your fiancée--

19:13.667 --> 19:15.867
-At 6:01 p.m.
-[Judy] When your fiancée was home.

19:15.934 --> 19:18.133
-Correct. That's when I told--
-That was six o'clock?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.166
-Yes, correct.
-That was six o'clock. And what time

19:20.233 --> 19:22.567
-did you arrive at the house?
-I told him at seven--

19:22.633 --> 19:24.867
No, no. What time did you arrive?

19:24.934 --> 19:28.333
I was ten minutes out at 7:38, so... 7:48?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.133
And you decided not to stay.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.867
We decided not to stay at his property.
Correct.

19:31.934 --> 19:35.266
Absolutely right. And you want your
deposit back, which was how much?

19:35.333 --> 19:37.867
It wasn't-- The deposit,
he never cashed that check.

19:37.934 --> 19:41.066
It was the actual cost of the rental,
which was $1180.

19:41.133 --> 19:45.066
Which she already got back, by the way.
Vrbo gave her her money back,

19:45.133 --> 19:47.834
back in January, so I'm not even sure
why we're here.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.834
-Did you get your money back?
-So, the--

19:49.900 --> 19:53.667
Just-- That's an either yes or a no!
Did you get your money back?

19:53.734 --> 19:56.533
It was reversed through the bank dispute,
but it was,

19:56.600 --> 19:59.467
they said that Terry
did not reimburse it. So,

19:59.533 --> 20:03.500
once we were to get him to reimburse it,
we were gonna give that back to Vrbo.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.000
Did you get your money back?

20:05.066 --> 20:07.333
-Yes.
-[Judy] So then, what are you doing here?

20:07.400 --> 20:09.266
Well, we had filed this
before we found that out.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.567
-[audience groans]
-Just a second.

20:11.633 --> 20:14.633
And when I called Vrbo to find out
why the money was reversed,

20:14.700 --> 20:17.400
it said because we had originally
disputed it with the bank

20:17.467 --> 20:18.867
and they did a long investigation.

20:18.934 --> 20:20.667
Don't tell me what they said.

20:20.734 --> 20:23.600
The refund on booking,
which I would've given you, actually,

20:23.667 --> 20:26.567
I actually think that you
stepped way over the line

20:26.633 --> 20:29.300
in going into the property and
telling the girls to leave.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.433
That's his responsibility, not yours.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.867
I knew he was dealing with his mom
so I said I would help him out, so.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.567
-[Judy] I'm just telling you,
-Okay.

20:36.633 --> 20:40.734
[Judy] it was nervy and bossy,
and you see five 17-year-old girls,

20:40.800 --> 20:42.233
they're very quiet-spoken,

20:42.300 --> 20:45.467
they weren't doing anything wrong,
they weren't disruptive,

20:45.533 --> 20:48.800
they weren't making noise.
And at 5:30 or six o'clock at night,

20:48.867 --> 20:52.133
you don't tell them to go outside,
you can't be here, and lock the door.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.633
That's ridiculous, sit down.

20:55.834 --> 21:01.066
$1180 is what you got back.
You're suing this man for $4,352.

21:01.133 --> 21:03.033
-[Melissa] That is correct.
-[Judy] For what?

21:03.100 --> 21:05.433
We also included the cost of the hotel
we had to find.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.500
[Judy]
That's your problem.

21:06.567 --> 21:09.433
He told you that you could stay there.
You decided not to stay there.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.900
I don't know why you're here.
I don't know why you're wasting my time.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.967
So, lesson is, anything that you want,

21:16.033 --> 21:21.300
the person that rents this house,
to do, to have, to spend, to occupy,

21:21.367 --> 21:26.066
anything that you consider
an integral part of the lease

21:26.133 --> 21:28.233
has to be in that document.

21:28.300 --> 21:32.734
Yeah. That's my, my bad. I thought it
was good 'cause they had to check it off

21:32.800 --> 21:34.266
before they even got that far.

21:34.333 --> 21:37.200
What I'm telling you is,
anything that's important to you,

21:37.266 --> 21:41.834
that number of people, how old they are,
anything, has to be in there.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.600
In any event, you got your money back.
You want the cost of your hotel.

21:45.667 --> 21:48.400
According to you,
you were going to eat in,

21:48.467 --> 21:51.300
and you were forced to go out for meals,
you're charging him for meals.

21:51.367 --> 21:53.367
Miss McDermott, Miss McDermott,
you're smarter than that.

21:53.433 --> 21:55.633
The case is dismissed, we're done.
Thank you.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.033
[Kevin]
Court's adjourned.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.200
[theme music playing]

21:59.266 --> 22:02.567
Well, I was furious. I was furious because
there was nothing that, you know,

22:02.633 --> 22:08.166
he had never said that no one could be
on the property unless they were 25.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.400
I had talked to Melissa before,
saying that

22:10.467 --> 22:12.400
she has to be there when they come in.

22:12.467 --> 22:15.600
I don't allow people to check in
unless the primary renter is there.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.300
I let him know that they were there.
Um, he could've called me like an adult

22:19.367 --> 22:21.367
and worked it out with me.

22:21.433 --> 22:24.200
Younger kids coming in, parents saying
that they're gonna be there,

22:24.266 --> 22:26.700
parents never show up and then
the kids are there for the weekend

22:26.767 --> 22:28.934
or for the four or five days
and they trash the house.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.100
I think, you know, it kinda sucks.
I feel like, you know,

22:32.166 --> 22:35.133
that's what we had planned for the weekend
and it kinda got ruined

22:35.200 --> 22:38.033
and I think the money should've
come out of his pocket, honestly.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.667
I think it's right. I mean,
she got her money back in January,

22:40.734 --> 22:42.834
she filed the case in June,
so how does she not know?

22:42.900 --> 22:45.100
And it is my money, they took it
out of my bank account.

22:45.166 --> 22:48.367
Like, the first shock of it
was pretty scary, but just, after that,

22:48.433 --> 22:50.333
you know, it was kind
of just annoying. [laughs]

22:50.400 --> 22:52.633
I'm gonna definitely alter the contract
to put that in there.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.934
I'll just know better from
this point forward when booking,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.367
to make sure that we get it all together
before we go.

23:00.300 --> 23:04.533
Okay. So, I've never rented an Airbnb.
Have you?

23:04.600 --> 23:08.100
I've tried, but I know that
that age requirement of 25

23:08.166 --> 23:11.533
is listed on a lot of properties
for owners to ensure

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
that an adult is present at all times.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.533
So each homeowner
can list house rules

23:16.600 --> 23:18.700
-that before you can lease the property...
-Okay.

23:18.767 --> 23:19.934
Get a lease. Got it.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
-...you have to agree to those terms.
-Got it.

23:22.066 --> 23:27.000
But to me, it sounded odd that he did not
include those terms in the actual lease,

23:27.066 --> 23:30.400
because as far as I know,
you don't sign off on the house rules,

23:30.467 --> 23:33.133
you just agree to them.
There's no signed--

23:33.200 --> 23:35.567
There's agree, don't agree,
like you get when you--

23:35.633 --> 23:37.500
It's either agree or
you pick a new property.

23:37.567 --> 23:39.834
The homeowner is assuming
that you've read those rules,

23:39.900 --> 23:42.467
and before you proceed to the next step
to receive a lease,

23:42.533 --> 23:45.867
they assume that you've read those rules
and are going to abide by them.

23:45.934 --> 23:50.567
Yeah, but it makes sense to have
those rules, either all of them,

23:50.633 --> 23:54.533
or some of them,
incorporated into a written lease...

23:54.600 --> 23:56.967
-Absolutely.
-...since you don't really sign off

23:57.033 --> 23:58.567
-on those house rules.
-Exactly.

23:58.633 --> 24:01.533
Okay, I got it. Anyway,
she got her money back.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.967
Her daughter is adorable,
she celebrated her 17th birthday.

24:05.033 --> 24:09.100
[chuckles] And the Defendant learned
that he has to modify his lease.

24:09.166 --> 24:13.133
And the nosy neighbor,
she went back to having dinner.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.567
Everybody's happy.
