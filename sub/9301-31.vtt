WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:35.901 --> 01:38.267
Eh, I don't like it when the
jungle gets quiet like this.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.672
Hey, it's okay, Cringe.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.774
Whatever it is, it's coming this way.

01:58.557 --> 02:00.889
I think the young lady
needs help ol' buddy.

02:01.126 --> 02:02.286
Oh no.

02:03.328 --> 02:05.660
By the power of Grayskull!

02:12.004 --> 02:16.100
I have the power!

02:16.642 --> 02:18.075
Here we go again.

02:31.256 --> 02:33.520
Help!  Oh, Help!

02:33.692 --> 02:34.886
Hello, gentlemen?

02:35.093 --> 02:36.424
Bah, who are you?

02:36.662 --> 02:38.220
Help!

02:38.430 --> 02:40.762
Let me go, you stinky creep!

02:40.766 --> 02:42.695
I think the young lady
would rather be with us.

02:45.304 --> 02:46.498
Freeze them!

02:52.477 --> 02:54.104
Them, you fool.

02:58.150 --> 03:00.277
How about a nice mudbath.

03:10.228 --> 03:11.559
Let me go!

03:12.364 --> 03:13.956
You heard the young lady.

03:28.914 --> 03:32.406
Ah, you were wonderful.
Thank you and you're...

03:32.618 --> 03:34.552
Oh this is, Battle Cat,

03:35.988 --> 03:37.250
and I am He-Man.

03:37.556 --> 03:38.887
Oh I've heard of you.

03:39.157 --> 03:40.681
We thought you were only a legend.

03:40.759 --> 03:41.783
We?

03:41.860 --> 03:45.091
I'm Princess Rhea.
My father is King Thales of Operon.

03:45.297 --> 03:47.128
See, this is my father's crest.

03:47.332 --> 03:49.300
Well, Princess...
- Oh please call me Rhea.

03:49.501 --> 03:52.732
All right, Rhea, Battle Cat
and I will escort you safely home.

03:52.938 --> 03:54.701
You can tell us more as we go.

03:56.441 --> 03:58.966
I thought I knew the
forest, but I got lost,

03:59.277 --> 04:01.177
and that's when the Gargons captured me.

04:01.346 --> 04:02.677
Where were they taking you?

04:02.881 --> 04:04.246
To the city of Targa.

04:04.449 --> 04:07.612
Queen Balina pays the Gargons for
all captives brought to her...

04:07.819 --> 04:09.116
especially captives from Operon.

04:09.287 --> 04:12.120
I'm sure she would pay a
very big price for a princess from Operon.

04:12.924 --> 04:13.924
Oh yes...

04:14.226 --> 04:16.421
and soon more Gargons,
will be looking for us.

04:16.595 --> 04:18.290
You're right.  How much further?

04:18.363 --> 04:19.892
We're almost to the top of the ridge.

04:19.918 --> 04:21.285
We can see the valley from there.

04:23.435 --> 04:24.595
The Valley of Operon.

04:25.037 --> 04:26.698
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

04:26.905 --> 04:27.997
It certainly is.

04:28.173 --> 04:29.868
And over there is my home.

04:30.042 --> 04:32.636
What is that city with
a huge light above it?

04:32.811 --> 04:36.042
That's Targa. The further we
stay from there, the better.

04:36.348 --> 04:37.898
Well, we'd better get across the river

04:37.923 --> 04:39.432
and find shelter.
It's going to storm.

04:46.692 --> 04:48.091
How will we get across now?

04:48.293 --> 04:49.487
I'll make a bridge.

04:51.263 --> 04:52.195
A bridge?

04:56.868 --> 04:58.597
There, this should do the trick.

05:04.009 --> 05:06.876
Okay, ol' buddy.
You take Rhea across and I'll follow.

05:31.369 --> 05:32.393
Oh no!

05:35.507 --> 05:37.065
Hurry, Battle Cat!

06:04.870 --> 06:05.837
There he is.

06:08.140 --> 06:09.266
Someone's coming.

06:12.277 --> 06:13.403
Targons.

06:19.551 --> 06:21.815
They're taking him to Targa.
Oh, we must follow.

06:42.307 --> 06:45.538
I'm Garn.
The strongest man in the kingdom...

06:45.777 --> 06:47.711
and soon to be master of the arena.

06:48.513 --> 06:49.741
Who are you?

06:49.948 --> 06:52.280
I... I don't know.

06:52.851 --> 06:56.184
I can't remember. Where am I?

06:56.354 --> 06:57.685
Why have I been brought here?

06:57.923 --> 07:02.724
The dungeon of Targa. You are a stranger.
You must be a spy.

07:02.961 --> 07:04.690
I... I'm no spy.

07:05.297 --> 07:07.288
At least, I don't think I'm a spy.

07:07.499 --> 07:09.865
All strangers are spies.

07:10.035 --> 07:12.401
Why are you here? Why the chains?

07:12.604 --> 07:14.868
I am the strongest man in all the kingdom.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.167
Yes, and perhaps, in all the universe.

07:17.309 --> 07:20.540
I make sport for Queen Balina in the Arena.

07:20.612 --> 07:23.308
She promised to release me
soon, a free man.

07:23.381 --> 07:24.746
A master of the arena.

07:24.816 --> 07:27.512
She thinks these chains are
a guarantee of our escape.

07:28.753 --> 07:29.777
Watch.. this.

07:38.296 --> 07:41.060
You are indeed strong,
with such strength...

07:41.233 --> 07:42.257
why don't you escape?

07:42.434 --> 07:46.837
There is no escape. The queen would
send soldiers to hunt for me down.

07:47.806 --> 07:50.104
Come with us, the queen wants to see you.

07:50.275 --> 07:51.469
Good luck, haha.

07:52.544 --> 07:53.943
Sounds as if I might need it.

07:56.314 --> 07:57.645
The prisoner, Sire.

07:57.816 --> 07:58.908
What is your name?

07:59.184 --> 08:01.243
I don't know. I can't remember.

08:01.453 --> 08:03.216
You expect me to believe that?

08:03.421 --> 08:05.446
-It is true.
You are lying.

08:05.690 --> 08:09.626
What other reason for a stranger
to be in Targa than to spy?

08:09.961 --> 08:12.691
You are a spy from Operon, aren't you?

08:12.898 --> 08:14.331
I... I know of no Operon.

08:14.633 --> 08:16.965
You're lying and you will pay...

08:24.676 --> 08:27.008
So, this is the stranger.

08:37.355 --> 08:41.883
Enough, release the guard.
I will handle this.

08:46.831 --> 08:50.358
You are either a very
brave warrior or a fool?

08:50.568 --> 08:53.503
Draca is the greatest
wizard in all the kingdom.

08:53.705 --> 08:56.640
Are you from Operon?
I don't know of Operon.

08:56.808 --> 09:00.835
You take me a fool? You stole Rhea,
the princess of Operon, from the...

09:01.046 --> 09:03.571
Gargons. I want to know
where you have hidden her.

09:03.782 --> 09:06.512
I tell you.
I don't know Rhea or Operon.

09:06.718 --> 09:08.515
I... I can't remember anything.

09:08.687 --> 09:13.147
Ah, you mean you won't.
Perhaps Garn can refresh your memory,

09:13.591 --> 09:14.717
in the arena!

09:14.960 --> 09:18.760
Guards, prepare our guest for the arena!

09:24.803 --> 09:27.067
I wonder what evil deed
they celebrate today?

09:32.010 --> 09:33.443
What is it, Battle Cat?

09:34.980 --> 09:36.379
He-Man!

09:37.315 --> 09:38.873
Battle Cat, wait!

10:05.243 --> 10:06.574
Oh, Battle Cat.

10:26.531 --> 10:30.058
Garn will soon have the
fool begging for mercy.

10:31.636 --> 10:33.627
Don't be too sure, Draca.

10:33.805 --> 10:35.534
To gain my freedom I must conquer...

10:35.774 --> 10:37.605
you and I will do it gladly.

10:37.776 --> 10:39.334
You forget one thing, Garn.

10:39.577 --> 10:40.577
What?

10:40.712 --> 10:42.304
There is a chance I may win.

10:42.514 --> 10:44.141
You?  Beat me?

10:44.315 --> 10:45.873
Let the contest begin!

10:51.523 --> 10:55.516
Now, my queen, we shall see
this spy gets what he deserves.

10:57.362 --> 10:59.853
This is, goodbye, stranger.

11:07.105 --> 11:09.767
Sorry, Garn, but I think I'll stick around.

11:10.642 --> 11:13.167
The stranger seems to be as
clever with the gladiators......

11:13.344 --> 11:15.312
as he is with the sorcerers

11:15.513 --> 11:17.879
A lucky accident, nothing more.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.779
Lucky move, stranger, but not this time.

11:26.691 --> 11:29.057
Come wizard's power, wizard's might...

11:29.260 --> 11:32.923
give Garn strength to win the fight.

11:47.112 --> 11:49.945
Ah, the tide has turned.

11:50.348 --> 11:53.681
I... I can remember. I know who I am.

12:07.065 --> 12:08.726
Take him to the lower dungeon.

12:13.238 --> 12:16.941
I have won and I am the
one to decide Garn's fate.

12:16.941 --> 12:20.968
You fool! Do you not
understand the queen's command?

12:21.246 --> 12:23.146
She is your queen, not mine.

12:23.348 --> 12:25.976
I have won and I say: Let him go!

12:26.151 --> 12:29.484
Set him free and bring the
stranger to me in the palace.

12:32.257 --> 12:33.349
Coming, Draca?

12:36.494 --> 12:39.202
But,
I would not have spared you.

12:39.227 --> 12:40.978
Why did you spare me?

12:41.799 --> 12:43.849
He-Man cannot decide your fate.

12:43.874 --> 12:45.725
That is for you to decide.

12:46.104 --> 12:47.435
You alone.

12:49.140 --> 12:51.836
You... you are He-Man?

12:52.277 --> 12:55.872
I thought you were only... a legend.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.452
You sent for me?
-Yes.

13:03.254 --> 13:06.223
How would you like to be
my, Captain of the Guard?

13:06.391 --> 13:09.451
It is a generous offer
but, I cannot accept.

13:09.661 --> 13:10.389
Why not?

13:10.595 --> 13:12.688
I have seen that you are a cruel woman...

13:12.897 --> 13:14.694
and I cannot be a part of cruelty.

13:14.899 --> 13:16.833
Besides,
I have not completed my mission.

13:17.001 --> 13:18.901
And what is your mission?

13:19.103 --> 13:20.468
To find my comrades.

13:20.638 --> 13:22.833
Don't you mean Rhea?

13:23.041 --> 13:24.889
My queen, good news.

13:24.914 --> 13:27.263
The princess Rhea has been captured.

13:27.612 --> 13:29.375
Her father, King Thales of Operon...

13:29.547 --> 13:32.607
will be glad to pay for her safe return.

13:35.286 --> 13:38.483
A matter of urgency has just
been brought to my attention.

13:39.123 --> 13:42.115
Oh, you and Garn are free
to go in the morning.

13:50.001 --> 13:51.777
Hmm.. something is wrong.

13:51.802 --> 13:53.791
I wonder what she's up to.

14:01.579 --> 14:05.310
You made a wise choice in
letting the stranger go.

14:05.516 --> 14:08.212
He will never know we have the girl.

14:09.721 --> 14:12.884
Yes, I, guess it is better this way.

14:13.691 --> 14:15.625
Well, here's where we part, my friend.

14:15.827 --> 14:17.692
I am in your debt, He-Man.

14:17.929 --> 14:19.988
Let me help you find the princess.

14:20.164 --> 14:23.156
Then come along,
I just might need your help.

14:25.069 --> 14:26.297
It's Battle Cat.

14:26.504 --> 14:27.493
Battle Cat!

14:31.976 --> 14:32.943
This way.

14:44.822 --> 14:48.019
Cat, am I glad to see you, ol' buddy.

14:48.259 --> 14:49.817
Now, to get you out of there.

15:07.912 --> 15:10.346
Garn, this is Battle Cat.

15:11.115 --> 15:13.208
What a magnificent animal.

15:13.951 --> 15:16.181
Thanks for helping me out.

15:19.524 --> 15:20.616
Where is Rhea?

15:21.893 --> 15:23.861
Creatures took her.

15:24.495 --> 15:25.792
Gargons!

15:26.064 --> 15:28.532
And I know just where to look for her.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.595
C'mon fellas.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.796
You may go.

15:34.005 --> 15:36.013
They will be rewarded handsomely,

15:36.238 --> 15:39.328
for such a special prize.

15:39.477 --> 15:40.876
Is her father coming?

15:41.379 --> 15:42.676
Yes, my queen.

15:42.847 --> 15:45.975
King Thales should be here
soon with the payment.

15:58.906 --> 15:59.906
So, thats it.

16:00.534 --> 16:01.967
It must be King Thales.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.898
Yes, he's been captured
by the Queen's guards.

16:07.105 --> 16:08.697
C'mon, I've got an idea.

16:15.913 --> 16:17.676
Just what is going on here?

16:18.049 --> 16:19.380
There's no time to explain.

16:19.617 --> 16:21.141
I have a plan to free your daughter...

16:21.352 --> 16:22.649
But I'll need your help.

16:22.854 --> 16:24.151
I'll do whatever you say.

16:32.263 --> 16:33.355
Father.

16:37.068 --> 16:38.255
Now, my dear king.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.323
Have you brought the payment?

16:40.538 --> 16:42.529
I am your payment, Draca.

16:44.342 --> 16:45.366
That is...

16:45.576 --> 16:47.066
if you can collect.

16:47.311 --> 16:49.905
He-Man! Oh, you're alive.

16:50.314 --> 16:51.542
This stranger is...

16:51.816 --> 16:52.874
He-Man?

16:53.050 --> 16:56.110
I didn't believe you really existed.

16:56.354 --> 16:58.185
I guess you were wrong again.

16:58.389 --> 16:59.549
C'mon in, guys.

17:01.793 --> 17:05.523
You forgot to tell the guards
we were invited, Balina.

17:05.730 --> 17:06.730
Garn.

17:06.731 --> 17:07.823
And Battle Cat, who...

17:07.826 --> 17:10.124
enjoyed his visit in your pit trap.

17:11.536 --> 17:13.935
Do something to distract
them, we must flee.

17:14.172 --> 17:18.131
The mountain shall rumble.
My wizard's power make..

17:18.342 --> 17:21.641
All of Targa, tremble and shake.

17:27.050 --> 17:28.483
You fool!

17:28.686 --> 17:31.314
You forgot about the lake on the mountain.

17:34.492 --> 17:35.720
We are doomed.

17:35.893 --> 17:37.121
Not, if I can help it.

17:37.295 --> 17:39.195
Battle Cat,
you and Rhea go through the city...

17:39.230 --> 17:40.627
and take the people to the arena.

17:42.433 --> 17:43.480
Come on, Garn.

17:43.505 --> 17:45.483
I'll need your help one more time.

17:45.670 --> 17:47.160
What are you going to do?

17:47.371 --> 17:48.534
Save the city.

17:48.559 --> 17:49.629
If we can.

17:50.174 --> 17:51.733
Why should we help our enemies?

17:51.758 --> 17:53.065
They should be punished.

17:53.311 --> 17:55.438
It's not our job to
punish those who are evil.

17:55.613 --> 17:58.480
That's what the law and the
courts of Eternia are for.

17:58.683 --> 18:00.412
I believe all life is precious.

18:00.585 --> 18:02.450
Just as I spared your life...

18:02.620 --> 18:04.747
help me spare theirs.

18:06.524 --> 18:08.822
You're right, He-Man. I'll help you.

18:08.993 --> 18:10.654
We haven't have much time, let's go.

19:18.296 --> 19:19.991
We did it, Garn.

19:29.574 --> 19:30.563
Thank you, He-Man.

19:30.775 --> 19:32.675
You've shown me that along with a great...

19:32.910 --> 19:35.310
strength goes great responsibility.

19:35.513 --> 19:38.073
Well it's something that's easy
to forget in the heat of anger.

19:38.282 --> 19:39.909
I'll try my best to remember.

19:40.084 --> 19:43.576
And use my power to help
others, not to hurt them.

19:43.788 --> 19:44.914
I'll bet you will.

19:46.457 --> 19:48.220
Can't you stay a while longer?

19:48.392 --> 19:49.882
No, I'm afraid not.

19:50.127 --> 19:52.652
but Battle Cat and I will be back some day.

19:52.897 --> 19:55.422
Thank you, young man,
for helping my daughter.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.397
You're always welcome in our kingdom.

19:57.702 --> 19:59.260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

19:59.870 --> 20:02.100
I'll miss you too, Battle Cat.

20:02.907 --> 20:04.932
Come on, you big pussycat.

20:10.514 --> 20:11.708
We'll be back.

20:12.617 --> 20:13.675
Bye.

20:13.985 --> 20:15.282
-Goodbye.

20:15.486 --> 20:16.453
Bye.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.334
I hope you enjoyed today's adventure.

20:31.602 --> 20:34.162
You know, television is not the
only way to be entertained by an

20:34.372 --> 20:35.361
exciting story.

20:35.573 --> 20:37.598
There is another way.
It's called 'reading'.

20:37.808 --> 20:40.777
And one of the wonderful things
about books is that they allow you to

20:40.978 --> 20:42.912
choose whatever kind of adventure you like.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.411
A trip with an astronaut,

20:44.548 --> 20:46.539
an adventure with the great
detective Sherlock Holmes,

20:46.717 --> 20:48.480
a comedy, anything.

20:48.619 --> 20:50.314
You can find it in a book at your school

20:50.521 --> 20:51.988
or neighborhood library.

20:52.189 --> 20:54.084
Why, I'll bet there are
even some good books

20:54.109 --> 20:56.172
right in your own home,
just waiting to be read.
