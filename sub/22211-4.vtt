WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:03.465
How will we be remembered?

00:03.468 --> 00:05.843
Will it be for saving the world twice?

00:05.846 --> 00:09.014
No, we're the team who broke time.

00:09.016 --> 00:12.184
That's right, history
has been torn to shreds,

00:12.186 --> 00:13.593
which means it's up to us

00:13.596 --> 00:16.221
to put it back together
again piece by piece,

00:16.222 --> 00:18.390
fixing these so-called anachronisms

00:18.392 --> 00:20.859
before we get torn to shreds.

00:20.861 --> 00:23.662
So please, don't call us heroes.

00:23.665 --> 00:25.312
We're legends.

00:25.920 --> 00:26.902
Zari Tomaz?

00:26.905 --> 00:28.612
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:28.615 --> 00:29.947
Come with us if you want to live.

00:29.950 --> 00:31.657
That's enough, Zari.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.405
You're not going anywhere without us.

00:36.243 --> 00:38.744
My brother had powers
because he wielded this.

00:38.746 --> 00:42.280
He fought against A.R.G.U.S.'
injustices, so he was hunted.

00:42.282 --> 00:44.082
- We all were.
- Come with us.

00:44.084 --> 00:45.179
What would you rather do,

00:45.182 --> 00:46.552
hide from A.R.G.U.S. your whole life

00:46.554 --> 00:47.819
or time travel?

00:47.821 --> 00:49.554
- Whoa, Lily.
- I'm pregnant.

00:49.556 --> 00:51.226
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:51.229 --> 00:53.109
Hello?

00:53.112 --> 00:54.478
What's your name?

00:54.481 --> 00:57.415
Mine's Ray Palmer.

01:00.367 --> 01:03.068
52-19. I repeat, we have a 52-19.

01:03.070 --> 01:05.604
Subject on the move.
Lock down all exits.

01:05.606 --> 01:08.406
Code Red. Engaging lockdown protocols.

01:08.409 --> 01:10.475
He went this way.

01:15.215 --> 01:17.115
Got him.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.430 --> 01:29.230
He's headed for the lab.

01:32.866 --> 01:34.281
Can't let you go in there, Raymond.

01:35.602 --> 01:37.102
You're not gonna hurt me.

01:37.104 --> 01:39.337
I'm... I'm just a kid.

01:41.942 --> 01:43.942
And if you want to make it to adulthood,

01:43.944 --> 01:46.078
you'll start seeing the
reality of the situation.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.813
So...

01:47.815 --> 01:49.614
why don't you calm down

01:49.616 --> 01:51.983
and we'll have ourselves a nice chat?

01:56.325 --> 01:57.743
There you go.

01:59.544 --> 02:00.877
Now come with us.

02:04.898 --> 02:07.253
What makes a hero?

02:07.256 --> 02:08.521
Is it powers?

02:08.525 --> 02:10.435
Strength? Bravery?

02:10.437 --> 02:11.557
No.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.406
A hero is forged by his
or her relationships.

02:14.408 --> 02:17.370
Our bonds of brotherhood or sisterhood.

02:17.373 --> 02:18.973
That is why I'm taking you all

02:18.976 --> 02:21.179
through the ten-step
team-building process

02:21.181 --> 02:22.948
I perfected at Palmer Tech.

02:22.950 --> 02:25.517
Step one, part one: icebreakers.

02:25.519 --> 02:28.186
Dude, we've been stuck on a
ship that has one bathroom.

02:28.188 --> 02:29.804
I think we know each other well enough.

02:29.807 --> 02:31.221
And your timing couldn't be worse,

02:31.224 --> 02:33.724
given that we're being chased
by a water-wielding assassin

02:33.727 --> 02:35.034
and the Time Bureau.

02:35.037 --> 02:36.528
We need to grow as a team.

02:36.530 --> 02:38.497
First step is two truths and a lie.

02:38.499 --> 02:39.965
It's gonna be fun.

02:39.967 --> 02:41.500
Lie.

02:41.502 --> 02:43.721
I haven't started yet. Look...

02:43.724 --> 02:44.970
I know you guys probably think

02:44.972 --> 02:46.471
- this is lame...
- Truth.

02:46.473 --> 02:47.831
But we have a new crew member,

02:47.834 --> 02:50.175
and it is important for
Zari to bond with us,

02:50.177 --> 02:52.944
not only as team members
but as individuals.

02:52.946 --> 02:55.514
Yeah, well, I'm no hero,

02:55.516 --> 02:57.449
and I'm not a member of any team.

02:57.451 --> 02:59.951
Besides, I've already
have you all figured out.

02:59.953 --> 03:03.522
The old guy wants to be
anywhere but on this ship.

03:03.524 --> 03:05.034
These two have some

03:05.037 --> 03:07.241
will-they-won't-they thing going on.

03:07.244 --> 03:08.729
Rory's been drunk since breakfast.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.106
Jax is wondering if I'm single.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.329
And your ship's still mad at me

03:11.331 --> 03:13.432
for doing a teeny
hack on her subsystems.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.968
Now, what's this about one bathroom?

03:22.289 --> 03:23.254
Oy vey.

03:23.256 --> 03:24.203
Guys, guys.

03:24.206 --> 03:26.723
You're right, Haircut,
this is gonna be fun.

03:26.726 --> 03:28.993
Let's just skip to step two:

03:28.995 --> 03:30.195
trust falls.

03:30.197 --> 03:31.663
Now, to demonstrate,

03:31.665 --> 03:33.698
Mick, who hated me when we first met,

03:33.700 --> 03:35.921
will fall trustingly into my arms.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.749
All right, you promised me
good coin for doing this.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.672
And you said you weren't
gonna say that out loud.

03:41.841 --> 03:43.608
Well, just lean back and let go

03:43.610 --> 03:45.777
'cause I'm not going anywhere, buddy.

03:48.014 --> 03:49.247
What the hell?

03:49.249 --> 03:51.149
Gideon, what happened to Ray?

03:51.151 --> 03:56.087
According to public record,
Mr. Palmer died in 1988.

03:56.089 --> 03:57.689
Wait, Ray's dead?

03:57.691 --> 03:59.824
He better be.

03:59.826 --> 04:04.963
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:04.965 --> 04:07.765
How could Ray be dead?
He was just right here.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.568
Yeah, well, he owes me money.

04:10.570 --> 04:13.804
Gideon, you said Ray died in 1988.

04:13.807 --> 04:17.075
Mr. Palmer went missing
on October 31, 1988.

04:17.077 --> 04:19.358
They recovered the body two days later.

04:19.362 --> 04:22.646
He was found in the woods,
dead, only eight years old.

04:22.649 --> 04:24.682
If Ray disappeared on
Halloween, then we'll just

04:24.684 --> 04:27.018
go back to before
whatever happens happens.

04:27.020 --> 04:31.515
Gideon, get us to October 30, 1988.

04:31.518 --> 04:33.765
Wait. Are we time traveling?

04:33.768 --> 04:35.288
You better buckle up.

04:43.803 --> 04:45.737
Arriving in 1988.

04:45.739 --> 04:47.804
_

04:47.890 --> 04:49.331
_

04:49.334 --> 04:50.476
I should have said

04:50.479 --> 04:52.234
there are some really
strange side effects.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.418
_

04:54.848 --> 04:58.468
Buddy! Hey, you're alive. Aw, man.

04:58.471 --> 05:00.451
Oh, wow. I love you, man.

05:00.453 --> 05:01.719
Me too.

05:01.721 --> 05:04.989
And always ready for a bro-hug.

05:04.991 --> 05:06.524
I'm in the paper.

05:06.526 --> 05:08.660
And I'm dead?

05:08.662 --> 05:09.976
Not yet.

05:09.979 --> 05:11.963
We're in 1988, the day
before you disappeared.

05:11.965 --> 05:13.171
Okay.

05:13.174 --> 05:15.166
Well, I guess the fact
that I'm still here

05:15.168 --> 05:17.035
means temporal permanence hasn't set in.

05:17.037 --> 05:19.704
Which means we can still save my life...

05:19.706 --> 05:21.806
And enjoy 1988 while we're at it.

05:21.808 --> 05:24.909
Trust Ray to find the
bright side of dying.

05:27.314 --> 05:29.514
Uh, are you sure this is right?

05:29.516 --> 05:31.015
That sweater's totally awesome.

05:31.017 --> 05:32.250
How do I look?

05:32.252 --> 05:33.624
Honestly?

05:33.627 --> 05:35.453
Like you're being strangled by a Muppet.

05:35.455 --> 05:37.588
Can't believe people
used to wear this stuff.

05:37.590 --> 05:41.326
Hey, speak for yourself.
I look good in any era.

05:41.328 --> 05:43.594
I can't wait to show you guys my home.

05:43.596 --> 05:45.903
First we have to go to Pizza Master,

05:45.906 --> 05:47.031
best slice in town.

05:47.034 --> 05:48.546
Then we have to go to Video Village.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.365
I can't tell you how much of
my allowance I spent there.

05:50.367 --> 05:53.037
So you're always this positive,

05:53.039 --> 05:54.672
even when you're dead?

05:54.674 --> 05:57.075
How can you pretend
like everything's okay?

05:57.077 --> 05:58.910
I'm not pretending. I believe it.

05:58.912 --> 06:00.611
I found that if I can trust in myself,

06:00.613 --> 06:02.146
I can believe everything's okay,

06:02.148 --> 06:03.381
and it usually is.

06:03.383 --> 06:05.156
It's called positive thinking.

06:05.159 --> 06:06.792
Give it a shot.

06:06.795 --> 06:08.920
Is he for real?

06:08.922 --> 06:11.155
School's almost out. You ready, kids?

06:11.157 --> 06:12.457
Yeah, let's motor.

06:15.028 --> 06:17.395
Mm, this is amazing!

06:17.397 --> 06:22.066
Blue skies, smiling kids,
an actual white picket fence.

06:22.068 --> 06:24.068
Well, I think it's
actually a trellis, but...

06:24.070 --> 06:26.504
yeah, same thing.

06:26.506 --> 06:27.972
Oh.

06:27.974 --> 06:29.507
Wow, there I am.

06:29.509 --> 06:31.409
Thanks for the pop quiz, Mrs. Garvin.

06:31.411 --> 06:33.845
It really reinforced some fundamentals.

06:33.847 --> 06:37.214
Yeah, that's definitely you.

06:37.217 --> 06:40.070
Okay, now, whoever's
targeting me could be anywhere,

06:40.073 --> 06:41.906
so keep a lookout for anything unusual.

06:43.189 --> 06:45.156
Guys, here I come.

06:45.158 --> 06:47.291
I mean little me... He's coming at you.

06:47.293 --> 06:50.628
Catch up with me on
Main Street, and, um...

06:50.630 --> 06:51.796
keep me alive.

06:52.866 --> 06:56.000
Got eyes on Ray to make a move.

06:56.002 --> 06:58.202
Well, it looks like
you're taking a detour.

06:58.204 --> 07:01.472
Did you frequent the Ivy
Town Newsstand as a boy?

07:01.474 --> 07:02.570
Yeah, I must be picking up

07:02.573 --> 07:04.102
the new issue of "Scientific American."

07:04.104 --> 07:07.062
I was more of a "National
Geographic" boy myself.

07:07.065 --> 07:09.246
Once a geek, always a geek.

07:09.249 --> 07:12.083
Well, whoever's after
me could be there, so...

07:13.386 --> 07:15.186
Yeah, we'll stick on him.

07:17.643 --> 07:19.856
Okay, I got somebody
checking out magazines

07:19.859 --> 07:21.132
and one shopkeeper.

07:21.135 --> 07:23.369
I could knock this place
off with a water pistol.

07:23.372 --> 07:25.328
Okay, new mission:
keep me away from Mick.

07:25.331 --> 07:26.664
I don't want today to be the day

07:26.666 --> 07:28.199
I descend into a life of crime.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.374
Well, Haircut...

07:36.377 --> 07:38.079
looks like it's too late.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.677
Wait, what does that mean?

07:39.679 --> 07:41.124
You're by the candy bars.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.447
Well, get me away from
there. That stuff's poison.

07:43.450 --> 07:45.983
- Yeah, that's not all.
- Wait, what does that mean?

07:45.985 --> 07:48.553
- You're shoplifting.
- Wait.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.421
- What?
- Damn, Haircut.

07:50.423 --> 07:51.515
You had balls.

07:51.518 --> 07:52.924
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

07:52.926 --> 07:55.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:58.398 --> 08:00.624
Well, you have now.

08:00.627 --> 08:02.021
I'm proud of you.

08:03.636 --> 08:05.703
- Little you's on the move.
- Well, stop him.

08:05.705 --> 08:07.905
Me. Stop both of us.

08:07.907 --> 08:09.546
I'm no rat.

08:12.712 --> 08:14.512
Ready at the home front.

08:15.372 --> 08:18.173
See, now this? This is a time machine.

08:19.552 --> 08:21.419
I got eyes on little Ray.

08:22.255 --> 08:24.489
- We got hostile incoming.
- What is it?

08:24.491 --> 08:27.093
Assassin? Time Bureau?

08:27.096 --> 08:29.460
Almost as bad.

08:29.462 --> 08:30.728
Bullies.

08:30.730 --> 08:32.697
Hey, Palmer, let's play.

08:32.698 --> 08:35.533
No, it's just Gus and
Ty. We were friends.

08:35.534 --> 08:36.866
Very funny, guys.

08:36.870 --> 08:38.187
Do you want me to rough them up?

08:38.190 --> 08:40.071
Nah, nah, nah, it's, uh...

08:40.073 --> 08:41.414
They were just kidding.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.616
Give that back. Come on.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.386
- Give that back!
- Here.

08:45.389 --> 08:47.511
Beginning to think maybe
they weren't kidding.

08:47.514 --> 08:49.280
This is boring. Let's go, Ty.

08:49.282 --> 08:51.335
I can't believe he actually
thinks we're friends.

08:51.338 --> 08:52.871
Bye, guys!

08:52.874 --> 08:55.485
I guess kids are mean
in any time period.

09:01.327 --> 09:02.827
We circled the neighborhood,

09:02.829 --> 09:04.795
checked the yard. It seems normal.

09:04.797 --> 09:06.130
Scary normal.

09:06.132 --> 09:07.865
Maybe young Ray died of boredom.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.000
No, something's up. Something's wrong.

09:10.003 --> 09:11.562
Look, maybe it was the candy.

09:11.565 --> 09:13.310
Maybe I overdosed on
high-fructose corn syrup

09:13.312 --> 09:14.492
and food coloring.

09:14.495 --> 09:17.407
Or maybe your killer
aborted when we showed up.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.777
Let's get back to the ship and
check the historical record.

09:19.779 --> 09:22.380
Give me a minute.

09:27.460 --> 09:28.817
Dinnertime.

09:28.820 --> 09:30.253
Got you gummy bears,

09:30.256 --> 09:32.689
licorice, Nougat Nummies.

09:37.931 --> 09:40.231
Wait till we go trick-or-treating tomorrow.

09:40.233 --> 09:42.466
There's a whole lot more
where that came from.

09:42.468 --> 09:43.731
Huh.

09:43.734 --> 09:45.970
I'm talking to someone in my room.

09:52.807 --> 09:54.506
Knew you were hungry.

09:54.509 --> 09:56.142
Coast is clear, Gumball.

09:56.145 --> 09:58.746
You can come on out.

10:11.992 --> 10:13.459
Guys.

10:13.462 --> 10:16.429
I think I know what kills me.

10:16.432 --> 10:17.950
It's a Dominator.

10:24.403 --> 10:26.736
So... aliens are real.

10:26.739 --> 10:28.799
Yep, and those ones
are called Dominators.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.068
They're nasty too.

10:30.071 --> 10:32.303
Capable of telepathy,
advanced technology,

10:32.306 --> 10:34.205
and, the fun one, tearing
people limb from limb.

10:34.207 --> 10:35.907
- Great.
- The last time we faced them,

10:35.909 --> 10:37.709
they almost wiped out meta-humans

10:37.711 --> 10:39.287
and made us fight each other.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.111
And worse, fight together.

10:41.114 --> 10:42.814
And now little me kidnapped one

10:42.816 --> 10:44.349
and is treating it like a house pet,

10:44.352 --> 10:45.784
which would be cool if it wasn't deadly.

10:45.786 --> 10:46.896
Maybe the baby Dominator

10:46.899 --> 10:48.819
hasn't developed all
of its abilities yet.

10:48.822 --> 10:49.836
The infant of the species

10:49.839 --> 10:51.105
has the strength of the adult

10:51.108 --> 10:52.555
with none of its discretion.

10:52.558 --> 10:55.192
It can also mind-control
subjects at will.

10:55.195 --> 10:57.726
How can you not remember
befriending an alien?

10:57.729 --> 10:59.414
Because I didn't.

10:59.417 --> 11:00.742
It never happened to me.

11:00.745 --> 11:03.267
The Dominator is an anachronism.

11:03.270 --> 11:04.769
- It's time-displaced.
- Right.

11:04.771 --> 11:06.538
So we have to get the baby Dominator

11:06.540 --> 11:08.940
out of Ray's bedroom and
back to where it belongs.

11:08.942 --> 11:10.575
And how are we supposed to do that?

11:10.577 --> 11:12.344
Uh, well, it should be easy.

11:12.346 --> 11:13.649
All we have to do is sneak into my house

11:13.651 --> 11:15.961
tomorrow when my mom's
at work and I'm at school

11:15.964 --> 11:17.682
and kidnap the Dominator.

11:17.684 --> 11:19.117
I even know where the spare key is.

11:19.119 --> 11:20.986
Like stealing candy from a baby.

11:20.988 --> 11:23.455
But not as fun.

11:23.457 --> 11:25.505
Yo. Where were you, man?

11:25.508 --> 11:27.774
- You missed the team meeting.
- Oh, you finished already?

11:27.776 --> 11:30.661
I was just on my way, but I
can ask Gideon to debrief me.

11:30.664 --> 11:34.399
Uh, psychic connection, so I
know you're hiding something.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.602
I have no idea what you're referring to.

11:37.604 --> 11:38.875
Zari was right.

11:38.878 --> 11:41.072
You don't actually want to
be on the Waverider, do you?

11:41.074 --> 11:43.108
Don't be ridiculous. I am as committed

11:43.110 --> 11:45.176
to this mission as I've ever been.

11:53.820 --> 11:55.487
What's going on?

11:55.489 --> 11:57.455
Grey's keeping some sort of secret.

11:57.457 --> 11:59.055
You want to know what's going on?

11:59.058 --> 12:00.592
Well, do you know
what's going on with him?

12:00.594 --> 12:02.260
I have my suspicions, yeah,

12:02.262 --> 12:06.097
and I have my ways of
extracting information.

12:10.937 --> 12:13.238
Home, sweet home.

12:15.042 --> 12:16.984
- Wait.
- What? What is it?

12:16.987 --> 12:19.020
No shoes on the carpet.

12:19.023 --> 12:21.848
I guess I can probably
let go of that now.

12:21.851 --> 12:24.883
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:24.885 --> 12:28.119
Oh, man, never thought
I'd be here again.

12:28.121 --> 12:30.321
My brother Sydney and I

12:30.323 --> 12:31.790
used to fight over this thing.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.406
He always wanted to play "Tecmo Bowl,"

12:33.409 --> 12:35.627
and all I wanted to do
was play "Legend of Zelda."

12:35.629 --> 12:37.028
Yeah, the only video games we had

12:37.030 --> 12:39.431
were military training simulations,

12:39.433 --> 12:40.899
but yeah, that sounds hard for you.

12:40.901 --> 12:42.901
Our record player.

12:42.903 --> 12:45.203
- Hey, who's Billy "Jo-el"?
- What?

12:45.205 --> 12:47.372
"Piano Man"? "River of Dreams"?

12:47.374 --> 12:48.773
Really? Wow.

12:48.775 --> 12:50.508
You really did live in a dystopia.

12:50.510 --> 12:52.444
No time to waltz down memory lane, Ray.

12:52.446 --> 12:53.978
Find the Dominator and get out of there

12:53.980 --> 12:55.641
before anyone sees you all grown up.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.715
Dude, I didn't know you
were a Billy Joel fan.

12:57.717 --> 13:00.185
What's your favorite album?
Everyone says "The Stranger,"

13:00.187 --> 13:02.020
but for my money, "Nylon Curtain,"

13:02.022 --> 13:04.969
his Beatles tribute
album, is super ambitious.

13:04.972 --> 13:06.772
Let us know when you're heading out.

13:06.775 --> 13:08.660
We're ready for retrieval.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.596
Whoa. I never thought
I'd be back in my room.

13:11.598 --> 13:13.598
Guys, we're in my room.

13:16.002 --> 13:17.602
It's in the closet.

13:17.604 --> 13:20.171
Okay, no sudden movements.

13:27.714 --> 13:29.747
Ew, leave it to young you

13:29.749 --> 13:31.483
to see the best in that thing.

13:31.485 --> 13:33.218
Though you were pretty lonely.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.853
What? I wasn't lonely.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.969
I was just choosing
to focus on my studies.

13:37.972 --> 13:40.023
This is probably just
my scientific curiosity

13:40.026 --> 13:41.226
getting the better of me...

13:41.228 --> 13:42.694
- Great.
- Again.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.329
Popcorn's ready.

13:44.331 --> 13:46.197
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

13:46.199 --> 13:48.066
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, this is a problem.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.734
No. Yesterday I'm shoplifting.

13:49.737 --> 13:52.271
Today I'm truant. This thing
is turning me into Rory.

13:52.274 --> 13:53.404
Young you is on the way.

14:01.081 --> 14:03.815
Hey, no, get off me!

14:03.817 --> 14:06.618
No, no, no, no, no, I am not a toy!

14:06.620 --> 14:07.952
Stop that.

14:07.954 --> 14:09.487
Toys are our friends.

14:12.092 --> 14:14.425
I don't remember you.

14:14.427 --> 14:16.261
Hmm.

14:19.666 --> 14:22.267
Come on, this is my favorite.

14:22.269 --> 14:24.269
It's 1:30 already. It's morning.

14:24.271 --> 14:25.465

You have to hide.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.967
Where are you, Raymond?

15:32.921 --> 15:34.223
Why did I get a call saying

15:34.226 --> 15:35.690
that you didn't show up to school today?

15:35.692 --> 15:37.208
- Mom.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.317
I was sick.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.920
Si... sick.

15:39.923 --> 15:42.012
No kidding, of course you were sick.

15:42.015 --> 15:44.349
Sick from eating all this candy.

15:44.351 --> 15:47.118
You can forget about
trick-or-treating tonight.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.487
Guys, the Dominator's getting angry.

15:49.489 --> 15:51.889
Somebody needs to distract my mom.

15:51.891 --> 15:54.457
Fine, I'll take one for the team.

15:56.684 --> 15:58.763
Raymond, this is the
second time this month

15:58.765 --> 16:00.465
that I've had to leave work for you.

16:00.467 --> 16:03.101
First you're starting a
fire in the science lab,

16:03.103 --> 16:06.051
and then, what, now
you're sitting at home

16:06.054 --> 16:08.505
- skipping school?
- School is boring.

16:08.508 --> 16:09.926
I already know all the answers.

16:09.929 --> 16:12.180
Too bad, you're going
back, so grab your stuff.

16:12.183 --> 16:13.215
Let's go. Come on.

16:16.616 --> 16:17.982
What was that?

16:17.984 --> 16:19.951
Yeah, now would be great, guys.

16:25.525 --> 16:28.826
What now?

16:33.737 --> 16:36.613
Is there a cougar on the premises?

16:36.624 --> 16:38.169
Excuse me?

16:38.171 --> 16:39.704
Animal control.

16:39.706 --> 16:41.004
One of the neighbors said

16:41.007 --> 16:43.473
that they heard some strange
noises coming from your home.

16:43.476 --> 16:44.770
So that's what he's been up to.

16:44.773 --> 16:47.778
Yeah, we just got done wrestling a bear

16:47.781 --> 16:49.606
and saving, like, a busload of kids.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.343
- They were super cute.
- We just need to come in

16:51.345 --> 16:52.645
and take a look around.

16:52.648 --> 16:54.686
Uh, sure, come on in.

16:54.688 --> 16:56.020
- Whatever you need.
- Thanks.

16:56.022 --> 16:58.067
Whatever.

16:58.070 --> 16:59.703
It's my son.

16:59.706 --> 17:01.292
He's always sneaking off into the woods

17:01.294 --> 17:02.894
and bringing back strays.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.362
Don't worry, we have seen it all.

17:04.364 --> 17:05.614
Yeah.

17:05.617 --> 17:08.565
I just Ray would make
normal friends, you know?

17:08.568 --> 17:12.036
I mean, he would rather spend
his time with his animals

17:12.038 --> 17:15.675
and movies or his weird inventions.

17:15.679 --> 17:18.409
Sometimes I worry that he just gets...

17:18.411 --> 17:20.611
lost in his own head.

17:23.415 --> 17:26.017
Hey, I hope kid you
didn't hear all that.

17:26.019 --> 17:28.319
She always said she liked my inventions.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.840
- Captain Lance.
- What's up?

17:29.843 --> 17:32.322
I am detecting the approach
of another timeship.

17:32.325 --> 17:33.991
What if the assassin followed us here?

17:33.993 --> 17:35.313
We need to plead for clemency

17:35.316 --> 17:36.882
with the Time Bureau and ask for help.

17:36.885 --> 17:38.383
Whosever here could be tracking us.

17:38.386 --> 17:40.054
Stay off the comms.
I'm gonna check it out.

17:40.056 --> 17:41.588
You keep watch here.

17:41.591 --> 17:45.502
I'll be watching very, very closely.

17:51.811 --> 17:53.411
They know about you.

17:53.413 --> 17:54.879
We need to go.

17:54.881 --> 17:56.881
No one cares about me anyway.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.684
Oh, you need a friend.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.197
Uh-oh.

18:07.293 --> 18:09.327
Whoa, oh, no.

18:11.631 --> 18:13.008
Come on.

18:13.011 --> 18:15.600
Oh, no, I've got a playdate.

18:19.041 --> 18:21.374
Zari, stay with me.

18:21.377 --> 18:22.843
I don't want to spook the Dominator

18:22.846 --> 18:24.708
or traumatize my younger self.

18:30.884 --> 18:33.151
I should have stayed in 2042.

18:34.521 --> 18:35.920
Ray, hold on.

18:35.922 --> 18:37.281
How do you know my name?

18:37.284 --> 18:40.524
It's a long, mostly irritating story.

18:40.527 --> 18:43.194
The only thing that matters
is, I'm here to save your life.

18:43.196 --> 18:45.524
No, you want Gumball.

18:45.527 --> 18:47.498
Well, you can't have him.

18:49.102 --> 18:52.370
And I thought grown-up
Ray was annoying.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.710
Listen to me, kid.

18:59.712 --> 19:01.179
You don't want to be
alone with that thing.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.347
You don't know him. We're friends.

19:05.738 --> 19:08.085
Your friend is gonna kill you.

19:14.394 --> 19:16.125
If I don't do it first.

19:20.431 --> 19:22.478
What's going on? This about Grey?

19:22.481 --> 19:25.043
You said the professor's
been acting all squirrelly

19:25.046 --> 19:26.179
about where he's been.

19:26.181 --> 19:27.643
- Squirrelly?
- Yeah.

19:27.646 --> 19:29.681
When you're on the run,
someone usually cracks.

19:29.684 --> 19:31.651
Burns to crew to save themselves.

19:31.653 --> 19:33.052
Burns the crew how?

19:33.054 --> 19:34.807
Cutting a deal with the Time Bureau.

19:34.810 --> 19:37.290
You think Grey is ratting
us out to the Time Bureau?

19:37.292 --> 19:38.725
The old man wants off the boat,

19:38.727 --> 19:40.093
thinks we're in too de.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.594
Yeah, but he wouldn't do that.

19:41.596 --> 19:42.962
Really? Then...

19:42.964 --> 19:44.531
who's been boosting the jumpship

19:44.533 --> 19:45.865
while we sleep?

19:45.867 --> 19:47.534
- Gideon.
- I believe Mr. Rory

19:47.536 --> 19:49.269
is alluding to the fact that someone

19:49.271 --> 19:51.171
has erased the jumpship's travel log.

19:51.173 --> 19:52.772
Someone's been sneaking off the ship

19:52.774 --> 19:54.574
and snitching to the Time Bureau.

19:54.576 --> 19:57.377
And if there's one thing
I hate more than pigs...

19:57.379 --> 19:59.143
it's a rat.

19:59.146 --> 20:01.213
How far could he have gone?
He's just a little kid.

20:01.216 --> 20:02.449
Well, maybe if you hadn't stayed

20:02.451 --> 20:03.963
to flirt with Ray's mother.

20:03.966 --> 20:06.057
First of all, I didn't
flirt with Ray's mother.

20:06.060 --> 20:07.787
I merely charmed her.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.123
I can't help that I'm charming.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.792
Wait, wait, wait, are you jealous?

20:12.794 --> 20:14.494
Nathaniel,

20:14.496 --> 20:16.429
I just think we should keep it simple.

20:16.431 --> 20:17.997
Friends.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.667
Like we were before
all of this happened.

20:20.669 --> 20:22.275
I mean, that was still fun, right?

20:22.278 --> 20:25.103
Right, right, if we just had a timeship,

20:25.106 --> 20:27.674
we could go back to where
we never even lived together.

20:27.676 --> 20:29.342
- Nate, don't.
- With a Swedish bed

20:29.344 --> 20:30.518
we never quite assembled.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.377
I believe it was called a Double Dorff.

20:32.380 --> 20:34.981
- Just erased it and...
- Shh, Nate.

20:37.719 --> 20:39.886
I'm getting something this way.

20:39.888 --> 20:42.355
The mobile team is setting up a lab now.

20:42.357 --> 20:44.857
We need to find the
Dominator before it finds us.

20:44.859 --> 20:45.959
What about the kid?

20:45.961 --> 20:47.018
He comes with us.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.361
We can't have this getting out.

20:54.603 --> 20:56.803
Looks like a false alarm.

20:56.805 --> 20:58.838
No sign of the Time Bureau here.

21:08.087 --> 21:09.471
Gideon says the professor's

21:09.474 --> 21:11.608
been spending a lot of time down here.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.775
Whoa.

21:17.778 --> 21:19.150
The last time I was down here,

21:19.153 --> 21:21.793
this place was just a storage room.

21:21.796 --> 21:24.864
Looks like the professor's
been busy behind our backs.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.733
So what? He's a professor, man.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.001
That's what professors do.

21:28.003 --> 21:29.269
They invent stuff.

21:29.271 --> 21:32.305
- Stuff like...
- Like what?

21:32.307 --> 21:34.641
Like this.

21:34.643 --> 21:36.175
Best bet is,

21:36.177 --> 21:39.045
this is some sort of radio transmitter

21:39.047 --> 21:40.980
that communicates through time.

21:40.982 --> 21:42.849
With the Time Bureau?

21:42.851 --> 21:44.851
I can't believe it.

21:44.854 --> 21:46.787
Grey really is a traitor.

21:50.325 --> 21:52.229
Kid, I know you're in there.

21:52.232 --> 21:54.160
Oh, good, you found us.

21:54.162 --> 21:56.393
You shall not pass.

21:57.832 --> 21:59.298
There's no time for make-believe.

21:59.301 --> 22:01.354
You are in actual danger.

22:01.357 --> 22:03.658
Step down, you knave.

22:03.661 --> 22:05.705
Zari, think like a kid.

22:05.707 --> 22:09.108
You just have to play along.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.044
I'm...

22:11.046 --> 22:15.281
I'm here from a neighboring kingdom

22:15.283 --> 22:18.117
to speak to Sir Galahad.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.585
And?

22:19.587 --> 22:22.055
- Sir Gumball.
- And...

22:22.057 --> 22:23.493
Sir Gumball.

22:23.496 --> 22:25.763
Yeah, good, that's good. Keep going.

22:27.696 --> 22:30.063
It's an honor, my lieges.

22:31.700 --> 22:32.908
Got it. I repeat,

22:32.911 --> 22:35.701
- subject has been located.
- You lied to me.

22:35.704 --> 22:37.670
- No, I didn't.
- There he is! Get him!

22:37.672 --> 22:39.205
- Hey, let him go.
- You're coming with us.

22:39.207 --> 22:42.204
Leave me alone! Leave us alone.

22:42.207 --> 22:43.810
No!

22:52.841 --> 22:56.209
Careful. The Dominator's
sedation is wearing off.

22:56.211 --> 22:58.444
Don't worry, this little
fella's not going anywhere.

22:58.446 --> 23:00.213
Doesn't need to go anywhere.

23:00.215 --> 23:01.881
Using its telepathic powers,

23:01.883 --> 23:03.950
even a juvenile could
control us at its will,

23:03.952 --> 23:07.453
force us to set it free
or do each other in.

23:07.455 --> 23:09.589
I've seen it before.

23:09.591 --> 23:11.591
This will suppress its neural impulses,

23:11.593 --> 23:12.926
neutralizing its powers.

23:14.717 --> 23:17.266
As well as preventing it from
communicating with its mother,

23:17.269 --> 23:18.564
the queen.

23:18.566 --> 23:20.099
We have the girl in a storage room,

23:20.101 --> 23:21.801
and the boy's in questioning now.

23:21.803 --> 23:23.670
Get him to tell us everything he knows:

23:23.672 --> 23:25.812
where he found the creature
and how long he's had it.

23:25.815 --> 23:27.974
- Then what do we do with him?
- Make it so he can't tell

23:27.976 --> 23:29.342
anybody else.

23:29.344 --> 23:31.477
- You mean...
- Mm-hmm.

23:35.150 --> 23:37.951
This queen, if the baby
can control our minds,

23:37.953 --> 23:39.686
what is she capable of doing?

23:39.688 --> 23:41.087
Mental projection,

23:41.089 --> 23:42.722
supplanting thoughts and sensations

23:42.724 --> 23:44.791
into its victim's mind.

23:44.793 --> 23:48.127
Also known to protect
their young at any cost.

23:59.004 --> 24:02.000
You know what I'm looking for.

24:02.003 --> 24:05.911
A breath mint?
Dermatologist recommendation?

24:05.914 --> 24:07.447
Reese's Pieces?

24:07.449 --> 24:09.382
Oh, right, your kid.

24:09.384 --> 24:11.284
You're looking for your kid.

24:11.286 --> 24:13.286
And if you let me go, I'll help you.

24:13.288 --> 24:17.090
Your species cannot be trusted.

24:17.092 --> 24:18.691
Look, I want to help you.

24:18.693 --> 24:21.461
I do. You can't find him without me.

24:21.463 --> 24:23.062
Agreed.

24:36.378 --> 24:38.211
Going somewhere, Professor?

24:38.213 --> 24:39.464
I don't have time to explain.

24:39.467 --> 24:42.597
I'm taking the jumpship
whether you like it or not.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.718
Yo, aw, Mick, come on, man.
I just souped this baby up.

24:46.721 --> 24:49.555
Jefferson, please, I need you
to help me get out of 1988.

24:49.557 --> 24:50.757
Help you?

24:50.759 --> 24:52.492
After you've been lying to me?

24:52.494 --> 24:54.027
You've been sneaking out on us.

24:54.029 --> 24:55.361
You erased the jump logs.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.929
You're working with the Time Bureau.

24:56.931 --> 24:58.631
What? Never.

24:58.633 --> 25:00.867
What's in your back pocket, Professor?

25:03.204 --> 25:06.606
It's a trans-temporal communicator.

25:06.608 --> 25:08.898
Mm, so you can talk to your
little Time Bureau friends.

25:08.901 --> 25:11.444
No. So I can talk to my...

25:11.446 --> 25:12.979
Hey, Dad.

25:12.981 --> 25:14.292
My daughter.

25:14.295 --> 25:17.316
Oh, and all of you guys.

25:17.318 --> 25:20.062
- Hey, Lily.
- Dad?

25:20.065 --> 25:21.354
I think it's time.

25:21.356 --> 25:23.089
We're heading to the hospital now,

25:23.091 --> 25:24.924
and you're gonna be here, right?

25:24.926 --> 25:26.926
How could I miss the birth
of my first grandchild?

25:26.928 --> 25:29.362
Good 'cause... This baby's coming.

25:29.364 --> 25:32.565
Okay, I will see you there. Bye, Dad.

25:34.702 --> 25:37.336
I took the jumpship back to 2017

25:37.338 --> 25:40.039
so I could give Lily
the other communicator.

25:40.041 --> 25:42.041
And you wiped the jump logs why?

25:42.043 --> 25:44.811
Because I wanted you to know
that I was committed to you

25:44.813 --> 25:45.978
and to the team.

25:45.980 --> 25:47.580
I made the decision to stay

25:47.582 --> 25:50.450
and I needed you to
know that I meant it.

25:50.452 --> 25:53.186
Clearly, my subterfuge has...

25:53.188 --> 25:56.956
robbed me of the chance to be
at the birth of my grandchild.

25:56.958 --> 25:58.604
No.

25:58.607 --> 26:00.259
We can take the Waverider.

26:00.261 --> 26:01.994
What about the rest of the team?

26:01.996 --> 26:03.830
I'm sure they'll manage.

26:03.832 --> 26:05.398
You're serious?

26:05.400 --> 26:08.201
Grey, it's your first grandkid.

26:08.203 --> 26:11.471
Why would you think I'd
want you to miss that?

26:11.473 --> 26:13.139
Come on, man, let's go.

26:17.512 --> 26:18.911
What's going on? Where's kid Ray?

26:18.913 --> 26:20.646
They're interrogating me. Him.

26:20.648 --> 26:22.748
Code Red. Engaging lockdown protocols.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.717
Let's go.

26:24.719 --> 26:27.220
So why don't you calm down

26:27.222 --> 26:30.356
and we'll have ourselves
a nice little chat?

26:32.093 --> 26:34.060
There you go.

26:34.062 --> 26:36.162
Come with us.

26:40.201 --> 26:42.201
You're real.

26:44.072 --> 26:47.206
Go, go, go!

26:55.750 --> 26:58.351
We got to move. They
won't stay down long.

26:58.353 --> 27:00.052
We can't leave without Gumball.

27:00.054 --> 27:01.554
Look, that thing is not your friend.

27:01.556 --> 27:03.189
It may be cute and cuddly now,

27:03.191 --> 27:04.696
but sooner or later,
it's gonna turn on you.

27:04.698 --> 27:06.092
Gumball wouldn't do that.

27:06.094 --> 27:08.494
We can save him, I know it.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.196
Look, Raymond.

27:10.198 --> 27:11.711
I get that you're lonely

27:11.714 --> 27:13.599
and that you're just trying to cope.

27:13.601 --> 27:17.003
But, buddy, you can't live
in a fantasy world forever.

27:17.005 --> 27:18.771
- Ray.
- Look, trust me.

27:18.773 --> 27:21.140
I understand that it hurts to learn

27:21.142 --> 27:24.010
that the world isn't as
perfect as you want it to be.

27:24.012 --> 27:26.012
But sooner or later...

27:26.014 --> 27:28.181
you have to start facing reality.

27:28.183 --> 27:31.918
Otherwise you're gonna end
up getting yourself killed.

27:31.920 --> 27:35.188
Hey.

27:35.190 --> 27:36.789
Listen to us.

27:36.791 --> 27:38.758
We're gonna save your friend

27:38.760 --> 27:42.061
and make it out of here together.

27:42.063 --> 27:43.863
All right?

27:43.865 --> 27:46.232
Because that's what brave knights do.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.867
Right, Sir Galahad?

27:53.408 --> 27:54.540
Let's do it.

28:15.096 --> 28:17.648
- Where are you guys?
- Not sure exactly.

28:17.651 --> 28:18.949
Looks like they turned the rec center

28:18.951 --> 28:20.698
into some kind of
government research facility.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.453
We're on our way to
save the baby Dominator.

28:22.456 --> 28:24.402
- What?
- It's a long story.

28:24.405 --> 28:26.906
Well, that story's about to
get a lot more interesting

28:26.908 --> 28:29.740
because his mom just landed
and she's looking for him.

28:29.743 --> 28:31.543
Wait, the Dominator has a Mominator?

28:31.546 --> 28:33.512
And it gets worse.

28:33.514 --> 28:35.281
I think she might have read my mind.

28:35.283 --> 28:37.783
- Wait, what did she see?
- Well, she's looking

28:37.785 --> 28:39.018
for her baby.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.720
The last time I saw him was...

28:40.722 --> 28:42.455
At my house.

28:42.457 --> 28:44.090
My mom's home. If the queen finds her...

28:44.092 --> 28:46.025
Don't worry, we won't let that happen.

28:46.027 --> 28:47.273
I'll keep watch for the queen.

28:47.276 --> 28:48.661
- You check on Ray's mom.
- Okay.

28:48.663 --> 28:49.962
How do I look?

28:49.964 --> 28:51.464
I'm kidding.

28:56.137 --> 28:59.038
Animal control. Again.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.140
Back to check out my crawl space?

29:01.142 --> 29:02.775
Your who?

29:04.445 --> 29:07.246
So what's your excuse this time?

29:07.248 --> 29:09.515
Family of possums?

29:09.517 --> 29:11.817
Come to wrestle a bear?

29:11.819 --> 29:14.987
How did you make a family
of possums sound so sexy?

29:14.989 --> 29:17.490
Well, you found your animal right here.

29:17.492 --> 29:19.890
But good luck controlling her.

29:23.331 --> 29:25.097
Who's there?

29:38.946 --> 29:40.346
Mrs. Palmer?

29:40.348 --> 29:43.215
Please help me! Help!

29:43.217 --> 29:45.251
But if you're here, then...

29:46.854 --> 29:48.287
It's a...

29:48.289 --> 29:50.856
Wow, you are very powerful.

29:53.761 --> 29:56.262
You have no idea.

30:05.827 --> 30:07.594
Trickor-treat!

30:10.330 --> 30:12.997
Ray's mom, it's an honor
just to be nominated...

30:12.999 --> 30:14.866
We both know it's too late to stop this.

30:14.868 --> 30:16.748
Well, maybe if we just
get to know each other...

30:17.804 --> 30:19.904
Get away from him, you bitch.

30:19.906 --> 30:21.473
I knew it, you're jealous.

30:21.475 --> 30:24.008
No, she's messing with your mind.

30:24.010 --> 30:26.177
She's making you see things. That...

30:26.179 --> 30:28.012
Nate, that is not Ray's mother.

30:28.014 --> 30:29.887
Don't be ridiculous. Of
course it's Ray's mom.

30:29.890 --> 30:32.116
Who else would it be? Oh, my God.

30:32.118 --> 30:33.551
I kissed a Dominator.

30:35.055 --> 30:36.754
And I liked it.

30:36.756 --> 30:38.723
What's the matter?

30:38.725 --> 30:40.458
Don't you think I'm pretty?

30:47.801 --> 30:49.701
Hey, over here.

30:52.906 --> 30:54.272
Super ambitious album.

30:58.044 --> 30:59.878
Sara, we found the queen.

31:05.785 --> 31:07.986
Whoa.

31:07.988 --> 31:10.388
Awesome costume.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.723
I'm almost back to the ship.

31:11.725 --> 31:12.523
I'll fly to you,

31:12.526 --> 31:15.058
and we'll try to lure her onto the brig.

31:15.061 --> 31:17.762
Oh, crap.

31:17.764 --> 31:19.163
"Oh, crap" what?

31:21.868 --> 31:23.501
All right, on to plan B.

31:23.503 --> 31:26.037
Let's say somebody stole the Waverider.

31:26.039 --> 31:27.772
What if we give the queen what she wants

31:27.774 --> 31:29.707
and just hope she goes in peace?

31:29.709 --> 31:32.377
You mean the baby? I'm already on it.

31:32.379 --> 31:33.952
Gumball.

31:35.924 --> 31:37.615
Don't move.

31:37.617 --> 31:39.317
Step away.

31:39.319 --> 31:41.371
You have no idea what
that thing is capable of.

31:41.374 --> 31:43.788
We're taking it with us.
No one needs to get hurt.

31:46.159 --> 31:47.759
Can't let you do that.

31:47.761 --> 31:50.161
Uh, I don't think you want to do that.

31:50.163 --> 31:52.397
You should really lower your weapons.

31:55.435 --> 31:58.736
I-I can't.

32:00.540 --> 32:03.141
He's controlling them.

32:03.143 --> 32:04.542
Ray, turn it back on.

32:04.544 --> 32:05.677
- No.
- No? What?

32:05.679 --> 32:06.744
What do you mean no?

32:06.746 --> 32:07.845
It'll hurt him.

32:07.847 --> 32:09.080
He'll hurt all of us.

32:09.082 --> 32:10.515
He wouldn't do that.

32:10.517 --> 32:12.202
I can't believe I was this stubborn.

32:12.205 --> 32:14.519

me, we're all going to die.

33:23.390 --> 33:25.156
- Hey, we can use those.
- Those aren't ours.

33:25.158 --> 33:26.452
We can't steal.

33:26.455 --> 33:28.234
I knew you were a good kid.

33:28.237 --> 33:30.094
But let's just make an
exception, just this once.

33:30.096 --> 33:31.396
Guys, we've got the baby.

33:31.398 --> 33:32.648
And we got the queen.

33:32.651 --> 33:34.069
And she's trying to kill us.

33:34.072 --> 33:36.400
Let's hope everyone gets
here at the same time,

33:36.403 --> 33:39.093
or else we're gonna have
one angry alien mama.

33:39.096 --> 33:40.539
- We're gonna make it.
- Are you sure it's okay

33:40.541 --> 33:43.173
- we borrowed the Waverider?
- I'm sure they'll be fine.

33:43.176 --> 33:45.877
We're never gonna make it.

33:45.879 --> 33:48.112
They went this way!

33:48.114 --> 33:51.082
God, I hope this works.

34:04.964 --> 34:06.297
Hey, Gumball.

34:18.878 --> 34:21.545
Whoa. Mominator incoming!

34:21.547 --> 34:24.282
I'll take her. This one's personal.

34:24.284 --> 34:26.184
She put me in a cocoon.

34:31.458 --> 34:33.458
Whoa, it's like "E.T."

34:33.460 --> 34:36.260
- What's "E.T."?
- "What's 'E.T.'?"

34:52.011 --> 34:54.579
Go ahead.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.433
You have to go now.

35:15.435 --> 35:17.335
You need your mom.

35:17.337 --> 35:19.637
But we'll still be friends.

35:22.142 --> 35:24.242
I'll be all right.

35:24.244 --> 35:26.883
I have people here to take care of me.

35:32.585 --> 35:35.219
And I wouldn't have
found them without you.

35:37.690 --> 35:40.324
Go on. Go on, little buddy.

35:40.326 --> 35:43.027
Go to your mama.

36:10.790 --> 36:13.057
See you later, Gumball.

36:26.406 --> 36:28.706
I'm not crying. I just have, uh,

36:28.708 --> 36:30.775
alien goo in my eye.

36:30.777 --> 36:32.250
Yeah, me too.

36:32.253 --> 36:35.713
Now I'm gonna go brush my teeth forever.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.430
Wait. Why?

36:41.987 --> 36:43.753
I'm so glad

36:43.755 --> 36:47.724
I could be here to
welcome you to this world.

36:47.726 --> 36:50.593
I'm sure it's overwhelming,
and I'm sorry to say...

36:50.595 --> 36:53.129
it doesn't really ever go away.

36:53.131 --> 36:55.631
But this place...

36:55.633 --> 36:58.134
it's also full...

36:58.136 --> 37:00.770
of wonders.

37:00.772 --> 37:04.240
Wonders that I'm discovering even now.

37:07.112 --> 37:09.145
Hey.

37:09.147 --> 37:12.281
I'm sorry, man. I...

37:12.283 --> 37:13.983
You almost missed this because of me,

37:13.985 --> 37:15.268
because I didn't trust you, and...

37:15.270 --> 37:16.934
No, I should have been...

37:16.937 --> 37:18.353
I should have been honest with you

37:18.356 --> 37:19.822
from the beginning.

37:19.824 --> 37:21.457
You're as much a part of this family

37:21.459 --> 37:23.793
as Lily and Clarissa and now

37:23.795 --> 37:25.795
this little guy, Ronnie.

37:25.797 --> 37:30.233
It's perfect that you're
here with us right now.

37:30.235 --> 37:32.402
Mr. Rory, on the other
hand, is inexplicable.

37:33.972 --> 37:35.471
I thought we should celebrate.

37:35.473 --> 37:38.641
- Oh.
- One for you.

37:38.643 --> 37:40.309
- One for you.
- Thank you.

37:40.311 --> 37:42.149
- And one for you.
- Man, dude, come on, man.

37:42.152 --> 37:43.446
Not the baby.

37:45.050 --> 37:46.184
Cute.

37:50.522 --> 37:52.755
- What happened?
- Possums.

37:52.757 --> 37:54.791
It's mating season.

37:54.793 --> 37:56.125
They got all in your vents.

37:56.127 --> 37:57.560
So, um...

37:57.562 --> 37:59.223
we got rid of them.

37:59.226 --> 38:03.132
So you're saying one of
Ray's strays didn't do this?

38:03.134 --> 38:04.867
Your son?

38:04.869 --> 38:05.868
No, no, no.

38:05.870 --> 38:07.527
And, uh...

38:07.530 --> 38:09.839
don't worry, I'm sure he'll
grow out of that eventually.

38:09.841 --> 38:12.041
You know, and, uh,

38:12.043 --> 38:14.177
I think you're doing a
really good job with him.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.649
Yeah, so could we go now, please?

38:17.652 --> 38:20.116
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

38:20.118 --> 38:21.884
I can't believe you
made out with my mom.

38:21.886 --> 38:24.020
Look, man, it was the '80s.

38:33.031 --> 38:34.964
Did the right thing, you know.

38:34.966 --> 38:37.100
Letting him go.

38:37.102 --> 38:39.068
He was my only real friend.

38:39.070 --> 38:41.737
We were supposed to
watch the movie together.

38:43.608 --> 38:47.310
You know, I felt alone for a long time.

38:49.781 --> 38:51.547
So long that I just figured

38:51.549 --> 38:54.417
that's how things were gonna be.

38:54.419 --> 38:57.820
It turns out there were
people out there for me that

38:57.822 --> 39:01.023
I didn't even know I wanted.

39:01.025 --> 39:03.559
You'll find your people too.

39:03.561 --> 39:05.628
I promise.

39:05.630 --> 39:08.798
You just have to keep believing
that things will be okay

39:08.800 --> 39:10.600
even when it's hard.

39:10.602 --> 39:14.804
Will you watch the movie with me?

39:14.806 --> 39:18.608
Yeah, my ride's here,
but maybe next time.

39:21.012 --> 39:23.246
Besides, shouldn't you
be out trick-or-treating?

39:23.248 --> 39:25.248
Me and Gumball were gonna go together.

39:25.250 --> 39:28.270
Besides, I can't eat
all that candy anyway.

39:31.656 --> 39:34.157
Trick-or-treat!

39:34.159 --> 39:36.626
Hey, look at Palmer.

39:36.628 --> 39:38.027
What are you supposed to be?

39:38.029 --> 39:39.195
I'm the Atom.

39:39.198 --> 39:41.429
That's, like, the
coolest superhero ever.

39:41.432 --> 39:43.699
The Atom? That's a stupid name.

39:43.701 --> 39:46.135
Actually, I think it's pretty clever.

39:52.911 --> 39:54.243
Cool costume.

39:54.245 --> 39:55.645
I can't believe you guys

39:55.647 --> 39:56.979
talked me into wearing this.

39:56.981 --> 39:58.414
How do you fight in these things?

39:58.416 --> 40:00.483
Who are you guys?

40:00.485 --> 40:03.286
We're his friends.

40:03.288 --> 40:06.255
These guys are your friends?

40:06.257 --> 40:08.591
Cool.

40:08.593 --> 40:11.460
Hand the candy over.

40:11.462 --> 40:14.130
And your allowance.

40:22.740 --> 40:26.275
You know, in my time,
the FDA outlawed all this.

40:26.277 --> 40:28.744
Guess they got my letters.

40:30.615 --> 40:33.516
Hey, do your missions
always go this poorly?

40:33.518 --> 40:35.518
No, no.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.654
There was this one time where we...

40:38.656 --> 40:41.290
No, actually, yes, they do.

40:41.292 --> 40:45.127
Yeah, can't wait for the next one.

40:45.129 --> 40:49.065
Which means we should probably
get to know each other.

40:49.067 --> 40:50.900
So...

40:50.902 --> 40:53.035
two truths and a lie.

40:53.037 --> 40:54.312
Seriously?

40:54.315 --> 40:55.671
Are we team-building right now?

40:55.673 --> 40:56.874
Number one.

40:56.877 --> 41:00.208
Back home, my friends used to call me Z.

41:00.211 --> 41:04.313
Number two, I got a copy of
"Zelda" on the black market

41:04.315 --> 41:06.582
and never beat that final boss.

41:06.584 --> 41:08.017
Ganon.

41:08.019 --> 41:10.720
And number three,

41:10.722 --> 41:13.389
I love musicals.

41:13.391 --> 41:15.024
Hmm.

41:16.594 --> 41:17.994
Z...

41:17.996 --> 41:20.096
we're watching "Singin' in the Rain."

41:20.098 --> 41:21.697
I'll go get the popcorn.

41:23.735 --> 41:26.702
Hey, movie night. Want to join us?

41:26.704 --> 41:30.373
Man, I got some work to do, and...

41:30.375 --> 41:33.309
Actually, I want to ask you something.

41:33.311 --> 41:34.443
Yeah, shoot.

41:34.445 --> 41:35.968
It's just...

41:35.971 --> 41:39.081
Seeing Stein with his
grandkid earlier, I...

41:39.083 --> 41:42.184
I mean, we're his family,
but this isn't his home.

41:42.186 --> 41:45.921
- Not anymore.
- Yeah. But...

41:45.923 --> 41:47.590
you two are inseparable.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.725
Like, literally.

41:49.727 --> 41:51.294
That's what I need your help with.

41:52.830 --> 41:54.942
I want to break up Firestorm.
