Would you like some water?

02:11.431 --> 02:12.967
No. I...

02:15.569 --> 02:17.571
Would you like some water?

02:28.949 --> 02:30.758
What is that?

02:32.452 --> 02:34.523
Progress.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.518
Presentation starts in five minutes.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.715
I can't find it.

03:00.881 --> 03:04.158
Did you look under the desk?
Why would it be under the desk?

03:04.317 --> 03:06.354
That's where I found
your Seaborg Medal.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.399
How hard can it be to find
a 160-year-old pump handle?

03:11.224 --> 03:12.294
Depends.

03:12.459 --> 03:15.372
On what?
On who's doing the finding.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.034
Where did you...?
Where you left it.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.844
You're a lifesaver.
So I've been told.

03:26.239 --> 03:30.654
In 1854, London experienced
a terrible cholera outbreak.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.189
Local doctors
attributed the epidemic

03:34.548 --> 03:37.757
to "miasma" or bad air

03:37.984 --> 03:40.692
and they responded to it
by burning incense

03:40.887 --> 03:43.333
and promoting
the sale of fragrant flowers.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.168
Not, as you might imagine,

03:46.326 --> 03:50.331
terribly helpful to the 600 or so
who died of the disease.

03:50.497 --> 03:54.240
But a doctor and a clergyman

03:54.401 --> 03:57.007
mapped out the victims

03:57.170 --> 04:00.014
and this was the very first
epidemiological study.

04:00.407 --> 04:05.049
What they found was a cluster of <i>cases</i>
around Broad Street,

04:05.245 --> 04:07.555
where there was a city water pump.

04:09.116 --> 04:12.586
Defying the local authorities,
they did the unthinkable.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.424
They took off the handle.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.101
And the outbreak came to an end,

04:20.392 --> 04:23.135
but the lesson lives on.

04:23.296 --> 04:27.267
And so, unfortunately, does cholera.

04:33.406 --> 04:36.751
When a surgeon fumbles,
a patient dies.

04:37.410 --> 04:41.290
When we drop the ball, thousands die.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.319
As new CDC field officers,

04:44.551 --> 04:50.058
you are about to embark on a mission
to the far corners of the earth.

04:50.257 --> 04:54.262
And you will witness horrors
others cannot imagine.

04:54.461 --> 04:59.240
Horrors that make cholera seem tame.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.840
You will make sacrifices
that others find unthinkable.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.777
And your family and your friends

05:07.307 --> 05:09.913
will sacrifice right along with you.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.750
And you will do all of this

05:13.647 --> 05:16.992
because you cannot fathom
living any other life.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.799
This is no game.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.668
The stakes are very real.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.531
That's just Scotch in there,
by the way, single malt.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.539
In fact, toss it back.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.819
- Good luck to you all.
- Thank you, sir.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.030
Last night, a military
listening post received a distress call

06:01.228 --> 06:03.708
from a private research base
owned by Arctic Biosystems.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.901
Tsk. Big Pharma.
Just read about them.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.980
The call denoted
a possible retroviral outbreak.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.310
Two people dead that we know of
and a third person already infected.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.076
I'm sorry, who are you again?

06:15.308 --> 06:18.482
Major Balleseros, USAMRIID
by way of the Army Corps of Engineers.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.053
I'm to escort you
and your rapid response team,

06:21.248 --> 06:22.488
including Dr. Walker,

06:22.682 --> 06:25.526
up to the base to determine
whether it is a retrovirus.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.332
Now, given that the Army
fielded the distress call,

06:28.488 --> 06:30.365
we'll share jurisdiction
with the CDC.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.560
Looks like there's no jurisdiction at all.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.535
If the base is above the 83rd parallel,
it's international territory.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.809
We have no authority there.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.841
Arctic Biosystems
is granting us access, for now.

06:40.033 --> 06:44.539
How kind of them.
This is all fine, but why me?

06:44.738 --> 06:48.413
There are six other senior scientists
at the CDC who can run point on this,

06:48.608 --> 06:49.780
including Dr. Walker.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.684
The distress call
specifically asked for Dr. Walker.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.790
She thought it best that we include you.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.189
Uh, I'm, I'm still not following.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.691
The third infected patient is Peter.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.036
Who's Peter?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.266
My brother.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.806
Our primary goal
is to identify this pathogen.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.782
Sarah, you'll be with me and Peter
on the deceased

07:55.976 --> 07:58.115
to establish the extent of the illness.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.121
Julia will determine the cause.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.453
Doreen, swab every inch
of Peter's lab

08:02.615 --> 08:05.528
test every animal
for the source of the illness.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.595
How about you, G.l. Joe?

08:07.754 --> 08:10.667
What is it that you do exactly?
I'm a systems engineer.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.668
I'll analyze the infrastructure.
Air, water, waste treatment.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.036
Looking for ways the virus might have
spread through pipes or vents.

08:17.263 --> 08:21.177
So you're a glorified plumber.
Only if you're a glorified veterinarian.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.370
Look, we have no idea
what this thing is,

08:23.603 --> 08:25.276
so we treat it like a hot agent.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.646
BSL-4 protocol, full suits
and decontamination showers

08:28.842 --> 08:30.378
for every potential exposure.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.818
- That could eat up time.
- Better safe than sorry.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.823
Says the man who spent the night
in a hut full of Ebola victims.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.222
That's his ex-wife?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.496
Yep.

08:39.652 --> 08:41.325
Not what I expected.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.399
She's smarter than you.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.192
Doubtful.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.031
Better in the lab too.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.837
Highly doubtful.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.007
He never talks about her
or his brother.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.706
That's probably because he caught
her and his brother in bed together.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.048
Don't worry, they're professionals.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.220
They'll make it work.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.084
Why would I be worried?

09:09.482 --> 09:11.928
Because I see the way
you look at him.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.366
This is gonna be the most
frakked-up family reunion ever.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.762
Raptor 47 to
Arctic Biosystems, come in.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.740
<i>Raptor 47, loud and clear.</i>

09:26.900 --> 09:29.676
<i>We're making our fine! approach.
Clear for landing?</i>

09:51.191 --> 09:54.400
Daniel Aerov, head of security.
Sorry we don't have the red carpet.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.098
- We're not used to visitors.
- We're not used to red carpets.

09:57.564 --> 10:00.272
This is Dr. Hiroshi
Hatake, director of research.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.937
Alan Farragut, CDC.
Peter's brother, of course.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.387
We've come a long way for Peter.
When can we see him?

10:10.577 --> 10:13.148
He's been transferred
to our isolation facility.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.256
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.327
He's been in and out of consciousness
for the last eight hours.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.964
And the rest of your people? Are you
implementing hard or soft quarantine?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.225
Neither.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.334
You haven't locked down the base?
Allow me to explain...

10:25.558 --> 10:27.333
You have three victims
of an unknown pathogen.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.838
And only three,
who all worked in the <i>same</i> lab.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.908
There have been no other infections.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.577
Since we are not seeing
a base-wide outbreak,

10:36.769 --> 10:38.009
we are fairly certain

10:38.304 --> 10:39.408
it's not airborne.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.143
Well, at least you're fairly certain.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.821
- Hey, that's our ride.
- They can't stay here.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.789
The temperature can drop to minus 70.
Turns jet fuel to jelly.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.088
We can't risk leaving before we have
full containment. CDC protocol.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.095
Just made me feel better,
knowing they're out there.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.701
Camp Eisenhower's only 200 miles away.
They can be back here in no time.

10:58.858 --> 11:02.032
Please stick out your left hand.
RFID marker injected under the skin.

11:02.195 --> 11:06.166
We all have them. Yours will give you
unrestricted access to the base.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.546
<i>Main elevator security access granted.</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:24.055
<i>Level</i> B.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.397
Sweet Mother Mary Matthew.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.161
How many people work here?

11:34.360 --> 11:37.967
A hundred six scientists
from 35 countries,

11:38.131 --> 11:40.372
15 support staff.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.571
That's a lot of potential patients.
Let's focus on what we know.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.239
I'll need to see the records
of the infected,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.010
their professional
and medical histories,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.654
their living quarters
and any areas they frequented.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.687
And I want access to their lab animals
and research materials.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.656
I'll need to start tracking down
anyone they've been in contact with,

11:56.849 --> 11:59.193
for the past 48 hours.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.327
Understood.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.562
<i>Level</i> E.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.735
Now I wanna see my brother.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.709
<i>Level F.</i>

12:20.506 --> 12:23.385
I haven't talked to Peter
in a long time.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.418
How long?

12:34.787 --> 12:36.562
That night?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.537
I went home and packed a bag,
caught the next flight to La Paz.

12:40.727 --> 12:44.971
You always did have issues
with impulse control.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.741
I'm worried.
It's all right.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.713
We're here,
we'll do what we can for him.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.316
He's not the one I'm worried about.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.748
His vitals are all over the place.

13:26.673 --> 13:30.177
He probably won't make it
through the night.

13:44.590 --> 13:49.039
Peter, I'm going to ask you
some questions.

13:50.763 --> 13:54.973
If you can't speak,
try to nod yes or no.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.674
- Do you have a T1 link here?
- No.

13:59.872 --> 14:03.684
That's too bad. It's gonna take forever
to upload this data back to Atlanta.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.356
We don't have a T1
because it's obsolete.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.522
It's a synchronous optical network,
10 gigs a second.

14:10.717 --> 14:14.164
It has to be fast because we only get
the satellite an hour each day.

14:21.327 --> 14:25.969
You seem to know a lot about medicine
and technology for a head of security.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.372
Dr. Hatake taught me
everything I know.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.007
Where did you two meet?

14:34.907 --> 14:37.820
An orphanage in Barrow.

14:39.178 --> 14:43.558
He adopted me. I've been with him
as long as I can remember.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.422
Peter, it's me, Alan.

14:51.924 --> 14:55.497
Dr. Farragut, do you know
where you are?

14:56.162 --> 14:59.871
Do you know what happened to you?

15:03.536 --> 15:04.606
Yes.

15:07.039 --> 15:08.780
The white room.

15:12.211 --> 15:13.246
Peter.

15:13.446 --> 15:17.189
Peter, look into my eyes.
Look into my eyes. Can you do that?

15:17.383 --> 15:19.795
Look into my... That's it.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.864
Peter, it's me. It's Alan.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.245
Alan, the blood. It's black.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.619
I need a security team
to quarantine now.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.386
You lie. You all lie.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.584
Everyone lies!

15:54.153 --> 15:55.655
Everyone!

15:58.891 --> 16:00.268
Everyone lies!

17:03.122 --> 17:05.965
How long had Peter
been assigned to this lab?

17:06.791 --> 17:08.567
The last six months.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.204
Working on...?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.038
I'm afraid that's over my pay grade.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.712
You'd have to ask Dr. Hatake.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.472
You expect us to help you,

17:17.670 --> 17:19.547
but you won't tell us
what you're working on?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.414
We check that weekly.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.212
Good for you.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.056
Aren't you a big girl...

17:37.523 --> 17:39.833
or boy?

17:42.194 --> 17:43.537
They have no sex organs.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.903
We've designed a way to inhibit
the signaling pathway

17:46.065 --> 17:47.738
responsible for genitalia.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.607
Makes control easier.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.746
Got an ex-husband
I wouldn't mind trying that on.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.050
Where are the monkeys?
We don't have any monkeys.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.691
You're kidding, right?
With the kind of work you're doing here?

18:02.515 --> 18:04.927
No monkeys means no monkeys.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.903
These are the other two victims
that were found with Peter.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.374
You ready?
Yeah.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.545
Open the bag.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.051
What the hell?

19:09.181 --> 19:11.127
That won't happen again.
You have my word.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.853
No, Sarah, it's okay.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.659
I've been around some nasty hot agents,
but never seen anything like that.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.767
No one has seen anything like this.

19:17.957 --> 19:21.837
You still thinking retrovirus? Looks more
like some kind of hemorrhagic fever.

19:22.028 --> 19:25.373
Blood loss is consistent
with Ebola or Marburg,

19:25.598 --> 19:27.544
but this kind of tissue degradation...

19:27.767 --> 19:30.475
This thing doesn't kill, it annihilates.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.980
So how is Peter still alive?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.878
First things first. Where's Doreen?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.657
With Balleseros,
swabbing down Peter's lab.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.951
Good.
Get started on the assays, Sarah.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.458
- I need to see this thing to beat it.
- I'm on it.

19:44.650 --> 19:48.188
Jules, talk to Hatake. Find out
what our victims were working on.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.833
We need to find the causation of this.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.502
You should be in there with Peter.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.472
Whatever time he's got left...

19:59.665 --> 20:02.202
He wouldn't want me sitting around
watching him die.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.511
What are you gonna do?

20:21.153 --> 20:23.360
Yep, just as I thought.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.436
Hey, what are you doing?

20:30.696 --> 20:36.544
These live rats in the PRC test
confirm conclusively that Hatake's right.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.010
It isn't airborne.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.111
That's good news.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.689
Yep, except
I'm no closer to the source

20:49.882 --> 20:53.386
and I still have no idea
on the mode of transmission.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.624
I hate rats.
I don't.

20:57.690 --> 21:01.763
My dad was a master sergeant.
Moved us around a lot.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.066
Rats are easy to travel.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.268
You do this a lot in the service?

21:08.567 --> 21:11.275
Take apart drains and toilets
looking for viruses?

21:11.470 --> 21:15.384
I spent my first tour in Iraq,
searching for WMDs.

21:15.574 --> 21:18.316
See any action?
Rarely left the base.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.114
Sounds dangerous.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.724
Bet you got some
pretty nasty paper cuts.

21:24.550 --> 21:29.397
The last few years I spent harassing
the cartels in South America.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.125
Must have been shaking in their boots.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.729
Ever actually fire a gun?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.170
Not since boot camp.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.783
Hey, let me see that.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.328
What is it?
<i>M. mulatta.</i>

22:03.989 --> 22:05.662
Unless I miss my guess,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.832
this is from a rhesus macaque.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.669
So they have monkeys.
What's the big deal?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.438
That they lied about it.

22:13.699 --> 22:16.373
Monkeys are one of the main agents
of zoonotic transfer.

22:16.602 --> 22:19.674
That's passing a virus
from animal to human or vice versa.

22:21.607 --> 22:24.110
So, what didn't they
want us to find out?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.224
Dr. Hatake?

22:40.059 --> 22:42.039
Dr. Hatake?

22:57.142 --> 22:58.712
Unbelievable.

22:58.911 --> 23:02.358
The Arctic has a timeless quality.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.386
Don't you agree?

23:05.584 --> 23:08.326
Makes it a little tough
on the commute, though.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.658
We get more accomplished

23:10.823 --> 23:14.066
without the distraction
of the outside world.

23:14.593 --> 23:17.870
Like interference
from regulatory agencies?

23:22.835 --> 23:25.338
I need to know everything
about Peter's last few days.

23:25.504 --> 23:28.610
What he was working on...
I thought you might.

23:33.612 --> 23:36.388
What's all this?
Peter's research.

23:36.882 --> 23:40.557
There are 20 more boxes in his lab.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.699
That's gonna take me days
to sort through.

23:42.888 --> 23:44.697
Can you tell me
what he was working on?

23:44.857 --> 23:47.599
Mutagens, mostly.

23:48.060 --> 23:52.406
For speeding up mutations.
Those are dangerous.

23:52.598 --> 23:56.444
You wouldn't want to let
your children play with them.

24:00.572 --> 24:04.987
Do you have children?
No, I don't.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.923
Can you think of a correlation between
his research and the infectious agent?

24:10.082 --> 24:11.288
No.

24:12.318 --> 24:14.264
I'm sorry.

24:39.778 --> 24:41.815
<i>Shift one, report.</i>

24:42.014 --> 24:44.016
<i>Shift one, report.</i>

24:44.249 --> 24:46.422
<i>Shift one, report.</i>

24:53.859 --> 24:56.169
Alan, tissues samples are...

24:56.328 --> 24:58.604
Um, I didn't mean to interrupt.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.278
No, it's okay.

25:29.661 --> 25:32.164
<i>Entry 224.</i>

25:32.364 --> 25:34.344
<i>Got in some UV therapy this morning.</i>

25:34.833 --> 25:37.473
<i>Ran three miles on the treadmill.</i>

25:37.636 --> 25:42.415
<i>Ifs getting harder to tell day from night,
but I guess that doesn't matter.</i>

25:43.142 --> 25:44.917
<i>I'm still seeing T.</i>

25:45.144 --> 25:47.681
<i>She is terrific.</i>

25:48.647 --> 25:53.426
<i>But Fm starting to wonder whether
I'm truly meant for relationships.</i>

25:53.652 --> 25:56.258
<i>Ifs not that I'm bad at them.
It's more like,</i>

25:56.422 --> 25:58.698
<i>well, they're bad for me. Heh.</i>

26:00.859 --> 26:04.068
<i>More than anything, I am excited
about being up here.</i> I...

26:04.530 --> 26:07.170
<i>I understand certain things now.</i>

26:10.669 --> 26:12.671
<i>...up here. I...</i>

26:13.405 --> 26:15.908
<i>I understand certain things now.</i>

26:18.710 --> 26:20.348
What is it?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.115
Look at his hand.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.418
We used to do that,

26:24.583 --> 26:27.063
nights when our father
came home drunk or angry,

26:27.219 --> 26:29.256
which was most nights.

26:30.889 --> 26:32.698
What does it mean?

26:33.692 --> 26:34.932
Run like hell.

26:39.064 --> 26:42.739
You need to come to isolation now.
It's Peter.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.608
Contamination.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.080
<i>Contamination.</i>

26:48.440 --> 26:49.817
<i>Contamination.</i>

26:51.076 --> 26:53.556
<i>Contamination.</i>

26:53.745 --> 26:56.157
<i>Contamination.</i>

26:56.381 --> 26:58.327
<i>Contamination.</i>

26:59.151 --> 27:01.097
<i>Contamination.</i>

27:01.286 --> 27:02.822
<i>Contamina...</i>

27:03.055 --> 27:04.855
How could you leave him in there
with the saw?

27:05.057 --> 27:06.331
I was a little busy trying...

27:06.558 --> 27:08.401
Too busy to follow
BSL-4 safety protocol?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.440
You're both missing the point.
How'd he get out?

27:10.496 --> 27:13.238
He was terminally ill.
Now he's ripping out of restraints?

27:13.432 --> 27:16.276
We sealed off the entire floor.
Deactivated Peter's RFID chip.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.846
He's trapped.
But we need to get him out of there.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.675
We'll flood the
ducts with halothane gas.

27:20.906 --> 27:23.906
It'll knock him out for hours. Once
the gas clears, we'll retrieve his body.

27:23.942 --> 27:28.118
Look, Peter is our best chance
to understand how this pathogen works.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.284
He may have antibodies which have
allowed him to fend off the infection.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.520
We need him alive.

27:32.751 --> 27:36.358
I'm sorry, but I have the lives
of 120 others to consider.

27:36.922 --> 27:39.766
No one is safe from the virus
until we have contained him.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.839
<i>Security
teams, confirm level lockdown.</i>

27:45.998 --> 27:48.604
Once the gas clears,
I'll take a security team

27:48.800 --> 27:51.337
and we'll bring him back to isolation.

28:09.688 --> 28:13.500
If you're going up there, I'm going too.
I can't allow that. It's too dangerous.

28:13.659 --> 28:17.471
If there's any chance Peter's alive,
I need to be up there.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.209
As you wish.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.321
We've been at this for over
an hour and still no monkeys.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.228
If Hatake is granting us
unrestricted access to the base,

28:44.423 --> 28:46.369
why don't we just confront him?

28:46.525 --> 28:48.937
Yeah, right.
I doubt we'd get a straight answer.

28:49.161 --> 28:52.165
Besides, this is way more fun.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.776
<i>Access denied.</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:57.241
<i>Access denied.</i>

28:57.436 --> 28:58.676
<i>Access denied.</i>

28:59.571 --> 29:04.020
So much for unrestricted access.
You got any bright ideas?

29:17.089 --> 29:18.966
Liquid nitrogen.

29:19.191 --> 29:22.104
Freezing rearranges
the tensile strength.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.120
Huh.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.225
Northwest A, clear.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.561
<i>Section Northwest B, clear.</i>

29:52.758 --> 29:55.329
<i>Southwest B, we 're clear.</i>

29:56.261 --> 29:58.639
<i>Dr. Farragut, we need you to check in.</i>

29:58.797 --> 29:59.969
<i>Dr. Farragut...</i>

30:00.132 --> 30:01.736
Are you sure my
brother's up here?

30:01.933 --> 30:04.277
<i>We sealed the vents in this sector,</i>

30:04.436 --> 30:07.076
<i>and that concentration of gas
should have knocked him out.</i>

30:19.451 --> 30:20.657
Jeez.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.966
What the hell happened here?

31:06.465 --> 31:07.910
What's that smell?

31:08.133 --> 31:12.809
That is monkey. The only
creatures that smell worse are humans.

31:13.004 --> 31:14.984
There must've
been a hundred of them.

31:15.173 --> 31:16.208
Where did they all go?

31:16.375 --> 31:20.221
I don't know, but someone
busted off this cage door.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.993
From the inside.

31:33.692 --> 31:40.610
I've got something here.
Uh, black mucus. Southwest, uh...

31:42.401 --> 31:46.247
Yeah, Southwest C.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.610
He was definitely here.

31:54.279 --> 31:55.451
What was that?

32:06.124 --> 32:07.626
Peter.

32:08.393 --> 32:09.633
Peter.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.248
He's smart.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.916
Way too smart.

33:08.687 --> 33:12.464
There you are, handsome boy.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.702
Come on out.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.168
Peter.

33:22.367 --> 33:23.869
Come on.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.108
He's here. Peter's here.

33:29.307 --> 33:30.342
Wait for backup.

33:39.050 --> 33:41.030
Are you okay?
Am I cut?

33:41.219 --> 33:44.132
Do you see any breaks on the skin?
I don't think so.

33:44.322 --> 33:46.996
Be sure. It's important.

33:48.793 --> 33:49.863
You're okay.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.558
He's here. Peter's here.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.761
It's not him. It's...

34:18.989 --> 34:20.594
It's not Peter.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.070
Oh, my God.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.853
<i>He was on one of my security teams.</i>

34:43.047 --> 34:46.085
<i>Joseph Kneizeh, 31 years old,
Talkeeina, Alaska.</i>

34:46.284 --> 34:49.356
<i>- He was attacked and dismembered.
- This doesn't make sense.</i>

34:49.521 --> 34:51.091
The question is why?

34:51.255 --> 34:54.032
Why did Peter attack this man?
Why cut off his hand?

34:54.225 --> 34:57.365
And why is the pathogen
making him stronger?

34:57.562 --> 34:59.940
I wanna seal off this part of the base.

35:00.131 --> 35:02.975
All nonessential personnel,
keep them in dedicated safe rooms.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.545
Nobody travels unless
they travel with a partner,

35:05.737 --> 35:08.411
at least until we can recapture Peter.

35:09.474 --> 35:13.115
<i>Attention,
Code 830, Level G, Oncology.</i>

35:13.311 --> 35:15.450
Anything from the first set of cultures?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.992
Cells are heavily damaged,
or else totally deformed.

35:18.149 --> 35:21.323
It's like Armageddon down there.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.794
But no sign of a virus?

35:23.989 --> 35:26.094
I screened
for all current viral structures.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.771
Filaments, polygons,
cylinders, spheres.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.505
Even icosahedrons.

35:34.332 --> 35:35.675
What if it's not current?

35:37.836 --> 35:39.179
A couple of MIT scientists

35:39.337 --> 35:41.937
discovered evidence of ancient viruses
in the Greenland ice cores.

35:41.973 --> 35:45.580
They found these obsolete structures
dating back 140,000 years.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.961
Gotta hand it to Alan.
He's got an eye for the smart ones.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.197
It's not like that.
Not like what?

35:57.422 --> 36:00.596
Alan is a great mentor,
but there's nothing going on.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.170
I would have said the exact same thing.

36:04.763 --> 36:07.107
Only that was eight years ago.

36:12.537 --> 36:13.982
Look at that.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.345
What? What is it?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.018
Right there.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.880
That's only 15 nanometers.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.888
There's no virus that small.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.960
No current virus.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.062
I need you to finish this.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.733
Where are you going?
To find Alan. He needs to see this now.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.084
<i>We weren't even sure</i>

38:35.246 --> 38:36.806
<i>what we were looking for until Julia...</i>

38:36.948 --> 38:40.088
<i>Dr. Walker started checking
for paleoneurological structures.</i>

38:40.285 --> 38:41.992
<i>It's some form of spherical capsid,</i>

38:42.187 --> 38:45.862
<i>but unlike anything
we've ever seen before.</i>

38:46.090 --> 38:49.435
<i>It's not naturally occurring.
At least not in this century.</i>

38:50.428 --> 38:53.272
<i>Here it is blown up to 100,000 XP.</i>

38:54.199 --> 38:55.337
<i>Here's 500,000.</i>

38:55.533 --> 39:00.004
How was your walk in the snow?
Fine, thanks.

39:01.105 --> 39:05.986
A bit colder here than you're used to.
Doesn't bother me. I'm adaptable.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.317
You know what they say
about those who fail to adapt.

39:10.548 --> 39:13.222
The delivery will be on schedule.

39:13.451 --> 39:16.125
The schedule changed
when the CDC showed up.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.733
I had nothing to do with that.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.467
Either way, the people
you and I work for aren't happy,

39:22.660 --> 39:25.004
and now I have to clean up
your mess.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.370
<i>Hello, what the hell is that?</i>

39:29.200 --> 39:30.838
<i>Wait, there's more.</i>

39:38.543 --> 39:39.647
My God.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.291
