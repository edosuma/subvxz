(male narrator)
 Previously on
 Childrens Hospital..

00:04.072 --> 00:06.140
Detective Chance Briggs,
you dirty S.O.B.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.575
What's my old partner
doing here?

00:07.608 --> 00:09.143
- You're not cops?
- You loco?

00:09.177 --> 00:10.544
We're Puerto Rican
gang members.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.580
Amigo, you wanna go
to Chipotle after this?

00:12.613 --> 00:13.714
How's my son?

00:13.747 --> 00:15.549
Know the joke
where the patient says

00:15.583 --> 00:17.785
"Will I be able
to play the violin again?"

00:17.818 --> 00:19.753
The doctor says "yes",
the patient says

00:19.787 --> 00:21.455
"Great, because I've
never played before"?

00:21.489 --> 00:23.357
Well, your son's heart
is failing.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.327
[theme music]

00:30.164 --> 00:32.400
[car revving]

00:32.433 --> 00:34.502
* Ask myself why

00:34.535 --> 00:39.607
* Why can't I find
what I'm looking for *

00:39.640 --> 00:42.410
Let's blast the crap
out of this day, Dr. Richie.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.178
[screaming]

00:44.212 --> 00:46.314
Zoom!

00:46.347 --> 00:47.481
'Oh.'

00:47.515 --> 00:50.618
Come on! Laugh!
Damn it! Laugh!

00:50.651 --> 00:52.153
Stop it, Blake.
It's over.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.854
[ECG beeping]

00:53.887 --> 00:55.823
Time of death..

00:58.559 --> 01:00.694
Your life is going to be
very different now.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.496
You are officially handicapped.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.165
You're a broken American.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.833
[chuckles]

01:05.866 --> 01:09.703
I don't think so. I just got
a couple of broken fingers.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.272
I'm gonna be totally fine.

01:14.142 --> 01:17.077
[melancholic music]

01:25.319 --> 01:26.754
Knock knock.
Who's there?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.589
Not Billy Johnson
because I killed him.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.491
What happened today
wasn't your fault.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.693
Sometimes I wonder why
the American medical association

01:32.726 --> 01:34.562
even recognizes the healing
power of laughter.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.331
- They don't.
- It sometimes feels that way.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.867
Chief, I'm officially resigning
as a member of this hospital.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.202
Effective immediately.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.775
[soft music]

01:50.911 --> 01:52.546
I keep that lubed.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.283
'Blake?'

01:57.951 --> 01:59.287
Britches.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.426
- So I guess this is it.
- Why, Blake?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.495
Britches, we've been over this
a million times.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.229
I gotta travel the earth

02:09.263 --> 02:12.733
and bring the healing power
of laughter to children.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.868
Plus, I really wanna
bang an Asian chick.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.904
What are you doing here?

02:16.937 --> 02:19.373
It's my son. He's sick.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.876
They say he's gonna die.
I need a doctor I can trust.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.413
Well, that's rough timing,
Britches, because I just quit.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.780
Rather dramatically, too.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.816
I slammed a paper down,
that whole deal--

02:28.849 --> 02:32.353
Blake...I need you.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.887
Please.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.723
I'll think about it.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.425
I said,
I'll think about it.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.962
Excuse me,
I have an order

02:41.995 --> 02:45.399
of sweet and sour cop
with extra moustache.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.934
'Well, well, well..'

02:46.967 --> 02:51.239
...Detective Chance Briggs,
you big woman's blouse.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.275
- They told me you're in Iraq.
- Not anymore. Freakin' Obama.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.810
- I need a favor.
- Anything.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.547
I need you to get me
into Ward 8.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.916
Shh. Shh. Ssshhh..

03:03.717 --> 03:04.752
Wait, what?

03:07.288 --> 03:09.590
His white blood
cell count is low.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.625
I'm gonna start him on
broad-spectrum A.B's

03:11.659 --> 03:13.794
but...other than that,
I'm out of options.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.896
Out of options?

03:15.929 --> 03:18.732
What happened to the clown
who said we couldn't be together

03:18.766 --> 03:21.335
because you had to make
dying people laugh?

03:21.369 --> 03:22.870
And-And bang an Asian chick.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.805
Which I did,
by the way.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.908
It's urban myth that
they've sideways baginas.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.010
Did you say "baginas"?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.879
No, you did.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.649
I have a clown son
that needs a clown doctor.

03:35.683 --> 03:39.019
Cure him
the old fashioned way.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.255
[tense music]

03:41.289 --> 03:43.724
- You mean with laughter, right?
- I'm gonna punch you.

03:43.757 --> 03:48.462
I need info for a case. The only
person who has it is in Ward 8.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.498
Do you even know
what Ward 8 is?

03:50.531 --> 03:53.967
I do, but explain it as if I'm
hearing it for the first time

03:54.001 --> 03:56.670
and was being shown images that
illustrated what you're saying.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.540
Ward 8 is a secret wing
at Children's.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.609
'It houses one of the world's
largest populations'

04:01.642 --> 04:04.312
'of criminally insane children''

04:04.345 --> 04:08.015
'Adults never go into ward 8
because they don't come out.'

04:08.048 --> 04:10.518
(Chance)
'That's why I'm
going in undercover.'

04:10.551 --> 04:13.821
- Hey, kid, scram!
- Owen, it's me.

04:13.854 --> 04:17.491
Woah! You just
might pull this off.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.594
Okay, listen to me.
These doors open twice a day.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.764
So once you're in there, there's
no comin' out for 12 hours.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.965
Thanks, partner.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.301
- Could you hang on to my keys?
- Sure.

04:27.335 --> 04:30.037
- My Motorola. And Arnold.
- No problem.

04:30.070 --> 04:34.442
(female on speaker)
'Criminally insane children
only allowed beyond this point''

04:34.475 --> 04:35.809
'Lockdown commencing, five..'

04:35.843 --> 04:38.579
- Hey! Good luck.
- I don't need luck.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.013
I'm Chance Briggs.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.850
That kid just stabbed me.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.319
Owen!

04:45.353 --> 04:46.354
What?

04:50.824 --> 04:51.825
Damn!

04:51.859 --> 04:53.627
Clamp.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.828
Aaah!
Damn!

04:55.563 --> 04:57.365
Damn!

04:57.398 --> 05:00.368
Get used to the feeling of
your own hot tinkle, my friend.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.670
What the hell're you doing
in the men's bathroom?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.638
There're great freedoms to being
handicompetent.

05:04.672 --> 05:10.411
I am not handicompetent. I'm not
handi anything. I'm..

05:10.444 --> 05:13.013
I'm whole. Oh, God.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.688
[sobbing]
Oh! Oh, God!

05:20.721 --> 05:24.392
Hey! People will look
at you differently now.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.695
With a mixture of pity
and disgust.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.364
And a certain animal
sexual attraction.

05:30.398 --> 05:34.935
As if they feel that they can
screw your broken body

05:34.968 --> 05:36.470
back into working.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.808
Show me.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.010
[soft music]

05:46.880 --> 05:48.916
[moaning]

05:52.420 --> 05:54.054
What happened?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.889
They got you with a number two.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.025
They stabbed me
with their feces?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.428
- You must be new.
- How'd you know?

06:00.461 --> 06:03.631
You weren't wearing
your coloring book.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.666
I'm Cody, but everyone
here calls me Mike.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.435
Why's that?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.703
I guess because over
the course of three years

06:09.737 --> 06:12.606
I abducted and murdered
twelve men named Mike.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.709
- Is your name Mike?
- No.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.845
[clears throat]
No.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.982
I'm Gavin, Gavin McCloud.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.719
I got caught jerkin' off
in my neighbor's attic

06:25.753 --> 06:27.555
so I murdered them.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.524
Yeah. I hear that.
Attics are super sexy.

06:30.558 --> 06:34.695
Mike, I'm lookin' for a kid
named Randall Deakin.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.999
Look, Gavin.
No one sees Randall.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.968
- He gets inside your head.
- Mm-hmm.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.136
- Makes you do things.
- Hmm.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.072
- Terrible things.
- I hear that.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.207
Disturbing things.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.876
[gulps]

06:48.909 --> 06:51.745
- Thank you, Easter Bunny.
- B.P. is dropping.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.747
Shockingly, your rubber-chicken
treatment couldn't prevent

06:53.781 --> 06:55.015
complete organ failure.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.817
Might as well have
just tickled him.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.756
That just might..

07:04.124 --> 07:05.693
[dramatic music]

07:10.964 --> 07:13.901
[boy laughing]

07:15.903 --> 07:17.237
B.P.'s up!

07:17.270 --> 07:20.073
Heart rate is too.
He's totally cured.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.810
- 'You did it.'
- I did it!

07:22.843 --> 07:26.013
It's cause I cured him
the old-fashioned way.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.982
[melodramatic music]

07:33.053 --> 07:34.888
- What?
- I said, "thank you."

07:34.922 --> 07:36.924
Oh? It looked like
you were mouthing it.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.759
Yeah. I just
did that for effect.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.094
- Thought it was cool.
- Oh, yeah. That is cool.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.630
[slurping]

07:45.733 --> 07:46.734
[door slams]

07:47.635 --> 07:50.070
Who're you?

07:50.103 --> 07:52.606
I'm Gavin. I do bad
things in the attic.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.575
- How old are you, Gavin?
- Thirteen.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.944
'If you're thirteen,
you'll know what they call'

07:56.977 --> 07:58.779
'the Jonas Brother
not in the band.'

07:58.812 --> 08:00.614
The bonus Jonas.

08:00.648 --> 08:04.151
Miley Cyrus has a tattoo on her
left breast. What does it say?

08:04.184 --> 08:07.087
- Just breathe.
- Not bad.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.524
- Who sang "Night moves"?
- Bob Seger.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.059
I mean...Justin Bieber?

08:12.092 --> 08:13.561
What's Night moves?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.863
Crap!

08:15.896 --> 08:17.264
Please!

08:17.297 --> 08:20.534
What's the matter, Gavin?
You look sick.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.270
May be you need
some medication.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.706
Grimace, let's give him
my meds.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.907
All of them.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.843

08:42.121 --> 08:44.224
[sighs]
Dammit.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.162
You ready for a little
afternoon delight?

08:49.196 --> 08:52.332
And by delight I mean
I cripple bang you in a tub.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.201
- It's over, Glenn.
- What?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.236
It was just a sprain.
You'll be fine.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.938
No more
making love in cars

08:57.971 --> 08:59.807
parked as close as
possible to stores?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.576
Glen, I'm not attracted
to whole people.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.879
You are now
gross to me.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.981
Fine. I'll see myself out.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.217
Move!

09:10.250 --> 09:12.820
[melancholic music]

09:14.021 --> 09:16.223
Chief, this is for us.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.691
Ow!

09:17.725 --> 09:20.260
Quick! Use my vagina
as a splint.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.998
Come on!
Where are you, Briggs?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.169
(Owen)
'Briggs!'

(female on intercom)
'Preparing for evening lockdow''

09:31.371 --> 09:32.773
'Briggs! Come on, buddy!'

- Ah!
- No!

09:34.708 --> 09:35.709
[dramatic music]

09:35.743 --> 09:37.210
'No, Briggs!'

09:38.111 --> 09:39.379

09:39.412 --> 09:41.782
Briggs, come on!

09:41.815 --> 09:44.752
'Ah! Stop stabbing him!'

09:44.785 --> 09:46.887
- Ah!
- No, Briggs!

09:46.920 --> 09:48.121
Mike!

09:48.155 --> 09:50.157
Run, Gavin!
Get outta here!

09:50.190 --> 09:52.826
- He'll kill you!
- I'll be fine. Just go!

09:52.860 --> 09:54.995
You can make it, buddy!

09:55.028 --> 09:56.864
Aah..

09:59.700 --> 10:01.268
I need some help here!

10:01.301 --> 10:04.404
We got a patient with multiple
stab wounds. Prep the O.R

10:04.437 --> 10:07.274
No! Owen, it's okay.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.309
A friend taught me that.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.014
Classic, Mike.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.751
- Hey.
- Hey!

10:17.785 --> 10:21.288
Listen, um, I want to thank you.
You've really restored my faith

10:21.321 --> 10:22.923
in the healing power
of laughter.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.958
- I'm glad.
- Thank you.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.932
- Uh, what're you doing?
- Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.801
I thought that's
where this was going.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.869
- I'm happily married.
- I'm so embarrassed.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.405
It's okay. I'm flattered.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.440
Okay, well.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.275
Thank you.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.844
You're welcome.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.316
- Blake!
- Really?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.952
- I thought you were kidding.
- No, no. I'm not kidding.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.121
Okay, I get it.
I get it, okay?

10:54.154 --> 10:58.025
- Happily married.
- Okay. Thank you.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.795
