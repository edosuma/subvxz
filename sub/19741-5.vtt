WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:01.688
Previously on "The Catch"...

00:01.690 --> 00:04.618
We're here with LA's Chief of
Detectives, Nicholas Turner.

00:04.620 --> 00:06.022
Alice Vaughan stole my partner.

00:06.024 --> 00:08.023
She didn't have to steal me. I left.

00:08.026 --> 00:09.892
We had a life together, Ben.

00:09.894 --> 00:12.029
We were going to have a future together.

00:12.031 --> 00:13.897
And then you chose her.

00:13.932 --> 00:15.365
You're engaged to a con man?

00:15.367 --> 00:16.232
Mm-hmm.

00:16.234 --> 00:18.868
I guess it makes sense, given Ethan.

00:18.870 --> 00:20.236
Ethan was a mistake.

00:20.238 --> 00:21.771
- Are you happy?
- I am.

00:21.773 --> 00:23.406
That's all I ever wanted.

00:23.408 --> 00:27.010
I think you'd rather destroy
the Firm than let me have it.

00:27.012 --> 00:29.745
I can hardly coordinate
a mutiny from the inside.

00:29.747 --> 00:32.115
Well, if you didn't
do this, then who did?

00:32.116 --> 00:33.783
This is the woman who wants you dead.

00:33.785 --> 00:36.885
She's been studying Margot
Bishop for a long time.

00:36.887 --> 00:38.053
Who are you?

00:38.055 --> 00:41.223
You don't recognize me?
It has been a while.

00:41.225 --> 00:42.224
Mummy.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.576
Tessa Riley. Is that your real name?

01:01.578 --> 01:03.879
Depends on who you ask.

01:03.881 --> 01:06.114
When your entire life
has been based on a lie,

01:06.116 --> 01:07.582
it's hard to know what's real.

01:07.584 --> 01:10.452
I'll take that as a yes.

01:10.454 --> 01:12.554
So, Tessa, how old are you?

01:12.556 --> 01:15.089
That's also up for debate.

01:15.091 --> 01:18.292
Perhaps you should go
directly to the source.

01:18.294 --> 01:20.228
Tell us, Mum.

01:20.230 --> 01:23.097
Was I a winter baby?

01:23.099 --> 01:24.566
13, 14?

01:24.568 --> 01:26.467
15.

01:26.469 --> 01:29.303
And where do your adoptive
parents think you are right now?

01:29.305 --> 01:31.339
Well, I have no idea.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.407
I haven't seen them in over a year.

01:33.409 --> 01:35.442
But Steven and Suzanne never seemed

01:35.444 --> 01:37.845
particularly interested
in my whereabouts,

01:37.847 --> 01:39.747
even as a child.

01:39.749 --> 01:44.150
Seems odd considering
how much they paid for me.

01:44.152 --> 01:45.519
Paid?

01:45.521 --> 01:48.321
My parents were desperate

01:48.323 --> 01:52.192
to curry favor with the Kensington Firm.

01:52.194 --> 01:54.194
So when Sybil Griffiths approached them

01:54.196 --> 01:56.329
with a 9-pound, 2-ounce problem,

01:56.331 --> 01:59.099
they were more than happy
to provide a solution.

02:00.869 --> 02:02.936
In cash.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.108
Where are Steve and Suzanne now?

02:08.110 --> 02:11.978
Back in Sheffield with the
rest of their nauseating brood,

02:11.980 --> 02:13.179
I supposed.

02:13.181 --> 02:17.283
So you've been on your own
and on the run for over a year?

02:17.285 --> 02:18.885
It speaks.

02:18.887 --> 02:21.387
- I don't buy it.
- Why is that?

02:21.389 --> 02:24.189
Because no 15 year old is
equipped to survive on her own.

02:24.191 --> 02:27.059
And you're not attractive enough
to have got by on your looks.

02:27.061 --> 02:28.694
You can't fight genetics.

02:28.696 --> 02:31.363
It is difficult to
imagine a 15-year-old girl

02:31.365 --> 02:33.899
doing what you've done all by herself.

02:33.901 --> 02:35.667
Nothing like plotting
your mother's death

02:35.669 --> 02:38.670
to keep a girl motivated.

02:38.672 --> 02:42.741
Still, you'd think you'd at
least want to meet your mother.

02:42.743 --> 02:44.209
Alleged mother.

02:44.211 --> 02:47.346
Before you killed her.

02:47.348 --> 02:50.348
Imagine growing up in a home

02:50.350 --> 02:54.820
where everyone despised
you but you had no idea why.

02:54.822 --> 02:57.662
And then one day you
discovered the truth,

02:57.665 --> 02:59.424
and suddenly it all makes sense.

02:59.426 --> 03:03.261
All the shame, the abuse, the pain.

03:05.432 --> 03:08.366
And there's a person

03:08.368 --> 03:12.337
responsible for all of it.

03:12.339 --> 03:16.174
You do some digging, you
find out she's a mobster,

03:16.176 --> 03:18.343
a murderer,

03:18.345 --> 03:21.946
a monster.

03:21.948 --> 03:24.014
You poor thing.

03:32.291 --> 03:34.725
I'm so sorry.

03:36.462 --> 03:38.962
You're absolutely right.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.400
I am a monster.

03:46.472 --> 03:49.239
Deal with these. Have them tested.

03:55.930 --> 04:00.711

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:02.754 --> 04:04.286
There's no way that's Margot's kid.

04:04.288 --> 04:05.221
Why not?

04:05.223 --> 04:08.072
'Cause when you give birth, isn't, like,

04:08.075 --> 04:09.804
your body supposed to change?

04:09.807 --> 04:12.635
Don't the hips widen?

04:14.132 --> 04:15.264
I heard the hips widen.

04:15.266 --> 04:18.067
The lab says they'll get
the test results to us ASAP.

04:18.069 --> 04:21.237
In the meantime, Danny, can you
look into the adoptive parents,

04:21.238 --> 04:23.139
Steven and Suzanne Riley?

04:23.141 --> 04:24.840
Verify Tessa's story.

04:24.842 --> 04:26.409
Okay.

04:26.411 --> 04:29.477
Sophie, see if there's
anything we can use in here.

04:29.479 --> 04:30.445
Start with the phone.

04:30.447 --> 04:32.581
I will.

04:37.354 --> 04:38.987
What do you think?

04:38.989 --> 04:41.823
I think I need to call Ben.

04:41.825 --> 04:42.824
You're that sure?

04:42.826 --> 04:43.624
No.

04:43.626 --> 04:45.360
But if there's even a possibility,

04:45.362 --> 04:46.794
doesn't he deserve to know?

04:46.796 --> 04:48.263
Absolutely not.

04:48.265 --> 04:51.433
First of all, even if
Margot is her mother,

04:51.435 --> 04:53.435
no one's saying Ben's the father.

04:53.437 --> 04:55.537
And second of all, Margot's the client.

04:55.539 --> 04:58.973
It's not our business. It's hers.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.611
Unless Ben is the father.
Then it's my business.

05:07.817 --> 05:08.983
Say nothing.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.386
Hi.

05:12.388 --> 05:14.055
Check your text messages.

05:14.057 --> 05:14.889
Uh-oh.

05:14.891 --> 05:16.557
No, this is a good text.

05:16.559 --> 05:18.625
Are you wearing pants in this text?

05:18.627 --> 05:20.360
Well, now you're gonna be disappointed.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.296
I'm clicking on a link.

05:22.298 --> 05:23.497
Tell me what you see?

05:23.499 --> 05:25.250
Well, I hope what I see

05:25.253 --> 05:27.538
is an all expenses
paid vacation for two.

05:27.541 --> 05:28.406
Even better.

05:28.409 --> 05:30.137
That is our house you're looking at.

05:30.139 --> 05:32.959
- What?
- Luxury overwater villas in Belize.

05:32.962 --> 05:35.028
Construction starts next year.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.230
We can make a deposit now.

05:36.232 --> 05:37.430
What are you talking about?

05:37.432 --> 05:40.300
And by the time the house is
ready, my FBI deal will be over.

05:40.302 --> 05:43.070
Winter in Belize, summer in Gstaad.

05:43.072 --> 05:46.173
That's almost a year from now.

05:46.175 --> 05:48.408
Well, that's what's gonna
help me get through this year.

05:48.410 --> 05:51.210
Unless you hate it, we
can find somewhere else.

05:51.212 --> 05:53.580
I'm gonna call you back.
Rhys just walked in.

05:53.582 --> 05:55.682
He's about to tell me
where he was all night.

05:56.551 --> 05:58.851
I was... out.

05:58.853 --> 06:01.087
Enjoying a quiet evening
with an old friend.

06:01.089 --> 06:04.691
So this isn't you robbing a
liquor store in Beverly Hills?

06:04.693 --> 06:07.355
What?!

06:07.358 --> 06:10.029
That looks nothing like me.

06:10.031 --> 06:11.363
I don't know what you're talk...

06:11.365 --> 06:14.233
...talking about.

06:14.235 --> 06:15.668
Who's the girl monkey?

06:15.670 --> 06:18.838
As a matter of fact,

06:18.840 --> 06:21.540
Chloe Jackson is in town.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.074
Rhys. No.

06:23.076 --> 06:26.612
I can't help it, Benji.
She's so powerful sexually.

06:26.614 --> 06:27.513
I don't want to know.

06:27.515 --> 06:29.116
It's like there are magnets pulling me.

06:29.119 --> 06:30.282
Rhys, she's bad for you.

06:30.284 --> 06:31.750
She's the worst.

06:31.752 --> 06:34.753
She's cocaine and cookies and cognac,

06:34.755 --> 06:37.122
all of which she's asked me
to pick up on the way back.

06:37.124 --> 06:38.444
No, you are not going back there.

06:38.447 --> 06:39.524
Have to. Magnets.

06:39.526 --> 06:42.294
Rhys, I made a deal with the FBI.

06:42.296 --> 06:43.061
So have I, darling.

06:43.063 --> 06:44.529
No, you were a part of my deal,

06:44.531 --> 06:46.395
which means if you get
arrested, we both...

06:46.398 --> 06:48.180
Nobody's gonna get arrested, all right?

06:48.183 --> 06:49.906
Chloe's the best thief in the business,

06:49.909 --> 06:52.102
present company excluded, obviously.

06:52.105 --> 06:53.705
So just relax.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.409
Here.

06:55.412 --> 06:56.708
- These are for you.
- Rhys.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.543
We hit a jewelry store, as well.

06:58.545 --> 07:00.311
You didn't read about that, did you?

07:00.313 --> 07:01.813
That's how good she is.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.718
You understand that's
not how this works, right?

07:06.720 --> 07:09.754
You don't pitch me
cases. I bring you cases.

07:09.756 --> 07:11.656
I see. So if I happen to find out

07:11.658 --> 07:14.758
that one of the world's most
wanted criminals is in town,

07:14.760 --> 07:16.760
I should not let my
friends at the FBI know?

07:16.762 --> 07:18.729
- And this criminal's name is?
- Chloe Jackson.

07:18.731 --> 07:19.663
Never heard of her.

07:19.665 --> 07:21.327
No, you haven't.

07:21.330 --> 07:24.231
But do you remember the narco
sub that went missing last year?

07:24.234 --> 07:26.303
Tucker Cross that was never recovered?

07:26.305 --> 07:28.005
The Russian crown jewels?

07:28.007 --> 07:29.806
Are you saying those
were all the same person?

07:29.808 --> 07:32.108
I'm saying if we take
down Chloe Jackson,

07:32.110 --> 07:35.412
you can close at least 10
open FBI investigations.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.980
And what do you get out of this?

07:36.982 --> 07:38.782
The satisfaction of a job well done.

07:38.784 --> 07:40.450
And?

07:40.452 --> 07:42.786
Maybe a few months shaved
off the end of our deal?

07:42.788 --> 07:45.955
And here I thought we were having
so much fun together drinking coffee.

07:45.957 --> 07:48.124
We are. But...

07:48.126 --> 07:49.759
The sooner you're done with your deal,

07:49.761 --> 07:51.794
the sooner you can
be with Alice Vaughan.

07:51.796 --> 07:54.106
You can't blame a guy for
thinking about his future,

07:54.109 --> 07:55.129
and yours.

07:55.132 --> 07:58.634
You could be the one who
brought down Chloe Jackson.

08:00.483 --> 08:01.782
Find anything on her phone?

08:01.785 --> 08:03.839
It's a burner. There's nothing on it.

08:03.841 --> 08:05.841
Anything else to identify her?

08:05.843 --> 08:08.778
No, but at least she's smart
enough to use protection.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.946
She's 15. Who's she sleeping with?

08:10.948 --> 08:13.849
- Just talked to her parents.
- The couple in Sheffield?

08:13.851 --> 08:16.460
They confirmed her story and sent this.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.553
Apparently Tessa was
expelled from school

08:18.555 --> 08:20.555
after threatening to blow it up,

08:20.557 --> 08:21.747
then ran away a year ago

08:21.750 --> 08:23.117
and they haven't heard from her since.

08:23.119 --> 08:23.825
Are they flying out?

08:23.827 --> 08:25.627
Based on the fact they
said we could keep her,

08:25.629 --> 08:27.963
I'm guessing no.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.835
"Initiating Phase Two. I'm going dark.

08:33.837 --> 08:35.169
Rendezvous as planned."

08:37.340 --> 08:39.206
- Phase two?
- She was working with someone.

08:39.207 --> 08:40.369
Which means Margot's still a target.

08:40.371 --> 08:42.076
Can we track down the
source of that text?

08:42.078 --> 08:43.110
- We can try.
- Find Margot.

08:43.111 --> 08:45.271
Let her know wherever
she is, she's in danger.

08:49.753 --> 08:51.485
Hello, Mum.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.787
We need to talk about the baby.

08:56.309 --> 08:58.158
The baby? Your baby?

08:58.161 --> 09:00.000
No, Mum. The next Dalai Lama.

09:00.003 --> 09:01.936
Of course my baby.

09:01.938 --> 09:03.504
What did you do with it?

09:03.506 --> 09:06.841
Why?

09:06.843 --> 09:09.910
Because with someone trying to
kill me and take down the Firm,

09:09.912 --> 09:11.912
I'm having a bit of a midlife crisis.

09:11.914 --> 09:14.147
Road not taken, that sort of thing.

09:14.149 --> 09:15.949
What did you do with her?

09:15.951 --> 09:18.919
- I gave her to a lovely...
- You gave her?

09:18.921 --> 09:22.690
I sold her to a perfectly
boring couple in Sheffield.

09:22.692 --> 09:26.860
You actually sold my
daughter, your granddaughter?

09:26.862 --> 09:29.097
Well, I could've chucked her in the bin.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.031
Instead, a business
transaction took place

09:32.034 --> 09:34.534
and everyone was happy, including you.

09:34.536 --> 09:37.337
Isn't capitalism wonderful?

09:37.339 --> 09:39.006
This is why I turned out this way.

09:40.276 --> 09:43.342
You're the one who begged me for
help with your little problem.

09:43.344 --> 09:45.311
You didn't want me keeping that baby...

09:45.313 --> 09:47.392
You gave it to me to get rid of it.

09:47.395 --> 09:48.527
I was a child!

09:48.530 --> 09:50.784
What was I gonna do with a baby?!

09:50.786 --> 09:51.984
Oh.

09:51.986 --> 09:54.086
She's found you, hasn't she?

09:56.124 --> 09:57.890
Fine, don't talk to me,

09:57.892 --> 09:59.792
but I'm not gonna be around much longer.

09:59.794 --> 10:01.994
Something terminal, I hope.

10:01.996 --> 10:04.297
I'm being extradited tomorrow.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.900
Mother England wants me home
to face charges, the old bitch.

10:07.902 --> 10:11.037
Well, at least someone wants you.

10:11.039 --> 10:15.674
You made the right decision,
you know, giving her up.

10:15.676 --> 10:17.976
Parenting's a cruel business.

10:17.978 --> 10:20.078
You'd never have stomached it.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.886
How could you give Chloe to the FBI?

10:27.888 --> 10:28.975
I did it to protect you.

10:28.978 --> 10:32.444
You did it to protect yourself
and your precious FBI deal.

10:32.447 --> 10:33.891
Chloe's gonna get you killed.

10:33.893 --> 10:35.827
Yeah, but what a way to go.

10:35.829 --> 10:37.844
Now she's never gonna
want to see me again.

10:37.847 --> 10:39.548
She probably won't want
to have sex with me.

10:39.550 --> 10:42.100
I will never forgive you for this.

10:42.102 --> 10:43.168
Neither will I

10:43.170 --> 10:45.736
if this Chloe Jackson
thing blows up in my face.

10:45.738 --> 10:46.938
So we are going after her?

10:46.940 --> 10:49.039
Listen, about Chloe.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.509
Ben told me that you've
been working overtime

10:51.511 --> 10:53.010
to try to get close to her,

10:53.011 --> 10:57.413
and I have to say I'm very impressed.

10:57.416 --> 10:59.256
Well...

10:59.259 --> 11:02.019
Happy to help. Anything for the team.

11:02.021 --> 11:04.188
Chloe Jackson obviously specializes

11:04.190 --> 11:06.890
in high risk and high reward robberies.

11:06.892 --> 11:07.481
That's true.

11:07.484 --> 11:09.460
She won't get out of bed
for anything under a million.

11:09.462 --> 11:10.961
And unless the whole world is watching.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.364
- She's a showoff.
- She likes a challenge.

11:13.366 --> 11:15.065
- She's a lunatic.
- She's uninhibited.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.801
- She's a murderer.
- She does not suffer fools.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.355
Do we know what she's here to steal?

11:20.358 --> 11:21.578
- Nope.
- But we do know

11:21.581 --> 11:23.228
someone who can find out.

11:25.777 --> 11:27.577
Rhys!

11:27.579 --> 11:30.747
That was...

11:30.749 --> 11:32.248
A start.

11:38.589 --> 11:41.057
Unless you have to work today.

11:41.059 --> 11:43.326
You never told me what the job was.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.463
And I'm not going to.

11:51.269 --> 11:54.783
Today is strictly play time.

11:55.788 --> 11:57.006
Who's that?

11:57.008 --> 11:58.607
I ordered room service.

11:58.609 --> 12:00.617
- When?
- Before you got here.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.177
I wish you'd told me. I'm famished.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.180
Oh, don't worry. I ordered for you.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.683
This is Raoul.

12:11.655 --> 12:13.821
Oh.

12:13.823 --> 12:16.158
Damn. I have to take this.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.061
Nope. If I put mine
away, you put yours away.

12:21.932 --> 12:23.031
All right.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.171
Data transfer initiated.

12:30.173 --> 12:31.682
No fighting, you two.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.474
There's more than enough of both of you.

12:34.878 --> 12:36.210
He knows we're listening.

12:36.212 --> 12:38.112
Please make it go faster
so we don't have to.

12:38.114 --> 12:39.246
Now, now, Raoul,

12:39.248 --> 12:41.449
you know it's not polite
to speak with your mouth...

12:41.451 --> 12:43.150
Data transfer complete.

12:43.152 --> 12:45.986
We just cloned Chloe Jackson's phone.

12:49.959 --> 12:51.692
A 15-year-old girl from Sheffield

12:51.694 --> 12:53.727
doesn't hire a hit man all by herself.

12:53.729 --> 12:57.331
So, you found out everything you
could about the Kensington Firm

12:57.333 --> 13:01.068
and then you found someone else
who wanted to take Margot down.

13:01.070 --> 13:03.971
Someone else who, based on
the condoms in your purse,

13:03.973 --> 13:05.973
is clearly using you.

13:05.975 --> 13:07.908
How do you know I'm not using him?

13:07.910 --> 13:10.210
So you are working with someone.

13:10.212 --> 13:11.177
And he's a him.

13:12.347 --> 13:14.247
Val, Nick for you.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.674
Tell him I'll call him back.

13:15.677 --> 13:20.386
No, I mean he's here for you.

13:20.388 --> 13:22.286
Ooh. Who's Nick?

13:22.289 --> 13:24.491
As you know, the
mayor's a few weeks away

13:24.493 --> 13:26.392
from appointing his new Chief of Police.

13:26.394 --> 13:28.394
- You mean you?
- Well, we don't know that.

13:28.396 --> 13:30.696
I've got the mayor's office vetting me,

13:30.698 --> 13:32.732
looking into 15 years of case work.

13:32.734 --> 13:34.199
I need to know where I'm vulnerable.

13:34.201 --> 13:34.956
Okay.

13:34.959 --> 13:39.505
So, I want to hire you guys to
do opposition research for me.

13:39.507 --> 13:40.539
On the other candidates?

13:40.541 --> 13:41.373
No, on me.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.275
You want me to dig up dirt on you?

13:43.277 --> 13:46.012
Starting with the Ethan Ward case.

13:46.014 --> 13:49.515
Now, I know you think Ethan
bought off the whole department.

13:49.517 --> 13:50.449
I never said that.

13:50.451 --> 13:52.717
No, you just quit being
a cop because of it.

13:52.719 --> 13:54.719
Here's the thing.

13:54.721 --> 13:59.024
You and I have worked
together for years.

13:59.026 --> 14:00.725
You know me better than anyone.

14:00.727 --> 14:02.194
And if I look dirty to you,

14:02.196 --> 14:04.196
I'm gonna look dirty
to the mayor's office,

14:04.198 --> 14:07.231
so I need you to find out the truth.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.100
Find out why Ethan's case was dropped

14:09.102 --> 14:11.302
so you and the mayor's office can see

14:11.304 --> 14:14.072
I had nothing to do with it.

14:14.073 --> 14:18.809
So, on a scale of 1 to 100, how
weird was it seeing Ethan again?

14:18.812 --> 14:20.812
200.

14:20.814 --> 14:23.281
Okay.

14:23.283 --> 14:24.248
Why?

14:24.250 --> 14:26.984
Because the mayor's
office is looking at Nick

14:26.986 --> 14:28.952
to be our next Chief of Police,

14:28.954 --> 14:32.156
and he's afraid they're gonna
think Ethan bought off the cops.

14:32.158 --> 14:34.892
So do we. I mean, we did, right?

14:34.894 --> 14:36.594
He swears it's not true.

14:36.596 --> 14:38.395
And he wants to hire us to prove it.

14:38.397 --> 14:40.263
Which would mean investigating Ethan.

14:40.265 --> 14:43.233
And you said 200, so
we are not doing it.

14:43.235 --> 14:44.037
Guys.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.170
I tracked the serial number
on Tessa's burner phone

14:46.172 --> 14:47.409
to a store in Burbank.

14:47.412 --> 14:49.173
It was purchased by a Felix McCall.

14:49.175 --> 14:50.507
Do we know who that is?

14:50.509 --> 14:51.742
He's one of my leftenants,

14:51.744 --> 14:54.111
and a whinging little
misogynist at that.

14:55.614 --> 14:58.415
I knew I should've killed
him instead of Ivor.

14:58.417 --> 15:01.851
But the truth is, Felix has
been useful to me in the past.

15:01.853 --> 15:02.885
How so?

15:02.887 --> 15:05.288
He's an expert in firearms
and tactical assaults,

15:05.290 --> 15:07.490
but his true genius is in demolitions.

15:07.492 --> 15:09.326
- Margot.
- He makes bombs.

15:09.328 --> 15:13.596
Improvised explosive devices,
both incendiary and chemical.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.606
We need to find him immediately.

15:20.188 --> 15:21.406
How was prison?

15:21.409 --> 15:23.227
How was your visit with Grandmama.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.622
We are well informed, aren't we?

15:24.624 --> 15:25.623
I said nothing.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.060
I assumed you'd want
Sybil to confirm my story,

15:28.062 --> 15:29.761
and everyone knows she's in prison.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.930
Brought down by her own daughter.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.132
It's enough to give a girl ideas.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.334
But they weren't your ideas, were they?

15:36.336 --> 15:37.735
They were Felix McCall's.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.919
Who's Felix McCall?

15:39.922 --> 15:42.474
You don't know? Ah, well, not to worry.

15:42.476 --> 15:43.775
He'll soon be dead.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.320
Given your management style,

15:48.323 --> 15:50.323
can you blame Felix
for wanting a new boss?

15:50.326 --> 15:53.159
And that's you, is
it? A 15-year-old girl?

15:53.161 --> 15:55.161
Is that what he promised you?

15:55.163 --> 15:59.700
Because the minute he gets
what he wants, he will kill you.

15:59.703 --> 16:01.214
Not everyone is like you.

16:01.216 --> 16:04.597
No, but Felix is. I know Felix.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.641
Yes. So do I.

16:09.424 --> 16:10.889
He did not.

16:10.892 --> 16:13.804
- Don't be jealous.
- He's twice your age, more than.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.540
Boys my age don't know what
they're doing down there.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.141
I will kill him.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.776
- Margot.
- No, you're right.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.312
I'll castrate him first, then
I'll kill him. You coming?

16:22.314 --> 16:24.214
No. You'll only try
and talk me out of it.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.782
Danny!

16:26.784 --> 16:30.186
Ahh. A mother's love.

16:34.501 --> 16:35.925
So, how did we do?

16:38.230 --> 16:39.896
It sounded like you did very well.

16:39.898 --> 16:42.662
Were you two listening?

16:42.665 --> 16:44.366
I expected as much from him,

16:44.368 --> 16:48.370
but very naughty, Agent Diaz.

16:48.372 --> 16:50.973
It seems Chloe has reached
out to three people,

16:50.975 --> 16:52.216
one of whom is Charlie Lowell.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.685
Oh, Charlie's in town? Love Charlie.

16:53.688 --> 16:54.902
Best wheelman in the business.

16:54.904 --> 16:56.638
So we know Chloe hired a getaway driver.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.713
We just don't know what she's
planning to get away from.

16:58.715 --> 17:00.582
Well, I can't ask her
again. She'll shoot me.

17:00.584 --> 17:01.683
She's very private.

17:01.685 --> 17:02.464
You won't have to.

17:02.467 --> 17:05.220
I'll ask my people to arrest
Charlie and the other two.

17:05.222 --> 17:07.856
Forcing Chloe to hire three
new people at the last minute.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.612
What, us?

17:09.615 --> 17:11.281
It's about time I met Chloe Jackson.

17:11.285 --> 17:13.095
Well, she doesn't hire
just anyone, you know?

17:13.097 --> 17:15.530
- Thank you for that.
- She will if she's desperate.

17:15.531 --> 17:17.098
And if we come highly recommended.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.773
Is everything all right, darling?

17:25.776 --> 17:27.275
Everyone is bailing on me.

17:27.277 --> 17:29.778
See, this is why I hate
working in Los Angeles.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.845
Everyone always cancels
at the last minute.

17:31.847 --> 17:33.747
No one ever does what
they say they're gonna do,

17:33.749 --> 17:36.384
and then the people
treat each other like...

17:36.386 --> 17:38.453
It was lovely to meet you.

17:38.455 --> 17:39.787
Not everyone's like that.

17:39.789 --> 17:41.422
Thanks for bringing the paddles, luv.

17:41.424 --> 17:43.791
I happen to know some very
reliable people in town.

17:43.793 --> 17:46.794
Total pros, proper villains.

17:46.796 --> 17:49.063
Yes, but proper isn't
the same as fun, is it?

17:49.065 --> 17:50.765
You know how I like fun.

17:50.768 --> 17:52.733
I do, darling. That's why I'm here.

17:55.905 --> 17:57.871
Thanks for the book, boys.

17:57.873 --> 18:00.107
Trust me.

18:00.109 --> 18:05.960
These people are just our kind of fun.

18:09.485 --> 18:12.419
This is the only local
address I have for Felix.

18:12.421 --> 18:14.321
Which means he won't be here.

18:14.323 --> 18:16.055
No, but he may have been careless enough

18:16.057 --> 18:18.158
to leave us something
that will help us find him.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.260
You know, when we got into this thing,

18:20.262 --> 18:21.761
you didn't tell me you were a mom.

18:21.764 --> 18:23.028
Do you think this is funny?

18:23.031 --> 18:25.331
There's no way that
kid is your daughter.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.967
That may be the first intelligent
thing you've said all day.

18:27.969 --> 18:31.220
- Open the door.
- Hey, be nice to me.

18:31.223 --> 18:33.305
You could use somebody
on your side right now.

18:33.307 --> 18:35.093
- Fine, I'll do it myself.
- Do not touch the door.

18:35.095 --> 18:37.665
You are a target, he is a bomb maker.

18:39.647 --> 18:42.481
Let's take a look at what's
on the other side of the door.

18:47.655 --> 18:49.654
I was right. Felix isn't here.

18:49.657 --> 18:50.529
How do you know?

18:50.532 --> 18:52.373
Because he's wired up
enough C4 on this door

18:52.376 --> 18:54.142
to level the whole building.

18:55.129 --> 18:56.862
Who are you calling?

18:56.864 --> 19:00.666
Bomb squad. Tessa
wanted you to come here.

19:00.668 --> 19:01.867
That bomb is for you.

19:03.788 --> 19:05.436
- Stop! We need her.
- Margot, don't.

19:05.438 --> 19:06.104
Where is he?

19:06.106 --> 19:07.602
Have you tried his apartment?

19:07.605 --> 19:09.141
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

19:09.143 --> 19:11.296
How many times have you tried
to kill me now and failed?

19:11.298 --> 19:12.388
I've lost count.

19:12.391 --> 19:13.944
Old age can do that to a person.

19:13.946 --> 19:18.149
Where is Felix? What is phase two?

19:18.151 --> 19:19.817
I will count to three.

19:19.819 --> 19:22.642
One.

19:22.645 --> 19:24.021
Two.

19:27.526 --> 19:29.560
You can't do it, can you?

19:33.900 --> 19:37.401
Because deep down, you know...

19:37.403 --> 19:40.537
I'm your little girl.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.685
Do your job. Find Felix.

20:05.313 --> 20:07.775
It's unnerving, isn't it?

20:07.777 --> 20:10.711
The idea that Margot Bishop had a child.

20:13.783 --> 20:18.285
I mean, abortions for
days, right? But a baby?

20:18.287 --> 20:20.087
But why do you think she kept it?

20:22.692 --> 20:26.828
What do you think was so
special about this pregnancy?

20:26.830 --> 20:29.864
In your professional opinion.

20:29.866 --> 20:32.366
You must have theories.

20:32.368 --> 20:34.234
Lots.

20:34.236 --> 20:36.770
Most having to do with my dad.

20:38.807 --> 20:41.808
I think she loved him.

20:41.810 --> 20:46.580
As much as she's
capable of loving anyone.

20:46.582 --> 20:50.016
She may have even
thought he was the one.

20:52.588 --> 20:56.590
Maybe he wanted her to have
the baby, begged her to have it.

20:56.592 --> 20:59.425
But in the end, she couldn't do it.

20:59.427 --> 21:02.562
She was too selfish. She hated the baby.

21:02.564 --> 21:05.764
She wanted it gone, so...

21:05.766 --> 21:09.359
she lied and told him it was stillborn.

21:12.539 --> 21:15.258
I think he knew she was lying.

21:19.047 --> 21:21.714
I think that's when
he started hating her.

21:24.118 --> 21:28.754
You must hate her, too.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.122
After everything she's done to you.

21:31.125 --> 21:35.427
Everything they've done to you.

21:35.429 --> 21:38.030
They?

21:38.032 --> 21:41.066
Margot and Ben.

21:47.574 --> 21:51.576
So, why not let me go?

21:54.581 --> 21:58.082
Let me get rid of her for both of us.

21:58.084 --> 22:01.052
Because trust me, your life
isn't gonna get any easier

22:01.054 --> 22:04.756
once Ben finds out about me, is it?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.727
Step-mummy.

22:12.098 --> 22:15.566
Who's buying an
over-water villa in Belize?

22:15.568 --> 22:17.935
I am with Alice.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.070
We're scheduled to move in

22:19.072 --> 22:22.906
in approximately 17 months,
23 days, about 4 hours.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.409
Even sooner if my boss can
shave a few months off my deal.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.911
Do you really think Alice Vaughan

22:27.913 --> 22:31.281
is going to give up
her career in 18 months?

22:31.283 --> 22:33.743
Because she isn't. And
then what are you gonna do?

22:33.746 --> 22:36.157
I can't be a criminal informant
for the rest of my life.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.520
It's too risky, for me and for Alice.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.989
But you could be

22:38.991 --> 22:42.926
a highly paid, well-respected
consultant to the FBI

22:42.928 --> 22:44.365
for the rest of your life.

22:44.368 --> 22:45.477
You could write a book,

22:45.480 --> 22:47.964
Spielberg could direct the movie.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.865
I appreciate your
concern for my well being.

22:49.867 --> 22:51.384
I'm being selfish here.

22:51.387 --> 22:54.584
I'm investing a lot of
time and money in you,

22:54.587 --> 22:58.039
and in 17 months, 23 days, and 4 hours,

22:58.042 --> 23:00.643
I have to start all
over with someone else?

23:00.645 --> 23:02.111
God knows who that's gonna be.

23:02.112 --> 23:04.779
Hello, party people!

23:04.782 --> 23:06.453
What's the matter with you two?

23:06.456 --> 23:10.969
I told you Chloe is expecting
you to be a fun couple.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.187
- We are.
- How are we not fun?

23:12.189 --> 23:13.990
We...

23:13.992 --> 23:16.488
A fun couple is a couple

23:16.491 --> 23:20.629
who has fun with other couples.

23:22.399 --> 23:24.733
Rhys speaks very highly of you both,

23:24.735 --> 23:27.503
but I don't usually work
with people that I don't know,

23:27.505 --> 23:32.307
so I'm glad we have tonight to
get to know each other better.

23:35.979 --> 23:39.714
So, six security guards
in the main showroom.

23:39.716 --> 23:41.182
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's right.

23:41.184 --> 23:43.551
And probably twice as many cameras.

23:43.553 --> 23:45.597
We can figure all this out later.

23:45.600 --> 23:51.025
I'll disable the alarm and
the cams, and then you guys...

23:51.027 --> 23:53.528
Are you sure about going
in during business hours?

23:53.530 --> 23:55.829
There are far too many security hurdles

23:55.831 --> 23:57.097
once the museum is closed.

23:57.099 --> 23:58.599
Plus, it'll be more fun this way.

23:58.601 --> 24:01.502
Doing it in public
with all the lights on.

24:01.504 --> 24:03.271
I...

24:03.273 --> 24:05.873
Oh, hello there.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.007
I'm sorry, that's my phone.

24:07.009 --> 24:09.242
Oh, honey. We should get that.

24:09.244 --> 24:12.012
It might be the babysitter calling.

24:12.014 --> 24:13.213
Babysitter? R-Really?

24:13.215 --> 24:14.730
Yes. I should probably...

24:14.733 --> 24:18.085
We together. The kids probably
want to talk to their mom.

24:18.087 --> 24:20.087
- You guys have kids?
- We do.

24:20.089 --> 24:21.789
Me, too! You want to see?

24:21.791 --> 24:25.091
Okay.

24:25.093 --> 24:27.960
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes, you are.

24:27.962 --> 24:29.929
And I could not be happier about it.

24:29.931 --> 24:31.631
Maybe try to hold on to that feeling.

24:31.634 --> 24:32.751
Why? What's going on?

24:32.754 --> 24:35.101
Have you ever wanted kids?

24:35.103 --> 24:36.051
What?

24:36.054 --> 24:37.537
I'm just wondering because...

24:37.539 --> 24:40.539
- Are you pregnant?
- No.

24:40.541 --> 24:42.441
- Allie...
- I swear, I'm not.

24:42.443 --> 24:44.310
Then why are you asking?

24:44.312 --> 24:45.447
I'm just curious.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.186
You just gave me a
bit of a heart attack.

24:47.189 --> 24:49.756
Because you do want kids or
because you never wanted kids?

24:49.759 --> 24:51.061
Where is this coming from?

24:51.064 --> 24:52.507
You keep not answering the question.

24:52.510 --> 24:55.121
Yes, because I'm in a...

24:55.123 --> 24:56.699
work situation.

24:56.702 --> 24:58.686
You see, you just did it again.

25:04.732 --> 25:06.064
Okay, fine.

25:09.604 --> 25:11.737
Yes, I wanted kids.

25:11.739 --> 25:12.881
You did?

25:12.884 --> 25:15.140
Yes, in the abstract,

25:15.142 --> 25:17.609
with the right person.

25:17.611 --> 25:21.146
Say if you called me, told
me you were pregnant...

25:21.148 --> 25:22.047
Which I'm so not.

25:22.049 --> 25:24.282
...I would be the happiest man alive.

25:24.284 --> 25:27.484
- You would?
- I would.

25:29.123 --> 25:30.655
Are you sure you're not?

25:30.657 --> 25:33.057
I'm not, I promise.

25:35.462 --> 25:36.994
Okay.

25:36.996 --> 25:39.864
But thank you for
answering the question.

25:39.866 --> 25:42.600
Thank you for...

25:42.602 --> 25:44.034
calling me at work.

25:48.141 --> 25:50.474
Sorry to end the evening early.

25:50.476 --> 25:52.209
Little Oliver isn't feeling well.

25:52.211 --> 25:55.379
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

25:55.381 --> 25:57.314
The night was just beginning.

25:57.316 --> 25:59.283
We should really get home.

25:59.285 --> 26:01.118
That's too bad.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.621
I was really looking
forward to working with you.

26:04.622 --> 26:06.489
We understand.

26:06.492 --> 26:10.327
It's too big a risk to work
with people you don't know.

26:10.329 --> 26:12.862
But it was lovely to meet you.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.808
Well, what the hell?

26:24.810 --> 26:26.434
You seem like good people.

26:28.579 --> 26:30.146
I look forward to working with you.

26:30.148 --> 26:32.715
Us, too.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.750
Honey, shall we go?

26:34.752 --> 26:36.686
Yes.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.090
Who knew crime fighting
could be so much fun?

26:42.092 --> 26:44.053
Are you sure you want
to give all this up?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.800
- Is she still in there?
- She's sleeping.

26:52.837 --> 26:55.370
She say anything useful after I left?

26:55.372 --> 26:59.007
Only that she thinks Ben is her father.

27:01.111 --> 27:04.379
Does she?

27:04.381 --> 27:06.815
And where are you with Felix?

27:09.386 --> 27:13.376
The bomb squad dismantled
the bomb in Felix's apartment.

27:13.379 --> 27:15.223
They're on the lookout for him now.

27:15.225 --> 27:17.459
I assume Tessa's still refusing
to give up his location.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.326
She is.

27:18.328 --> 27:21.128
But her phone has been very useful.

27:21.130 --> 27:24.399
I pinged the cell tower
that sent Felix's last text.

27:24.401 --> 27:27.134
He was somewhere in
this four-block radius

27:27.136 --> 27:28.602
in the financial district.

27:28.604 --> 27:30.404
He must've been there for a reason,

27:30.406 --> 27:33.307
so I printed out a list of all
of the businesses in the area.

27:33.308 --> 27:36.142
Maybe one of them rings a bell?

27:43.252 --> 27:44.785
Are you gonna tell Ben?

27:44.787 --> 27:48.822
There's nothing to tell.

27:48.824 --> 27:51.091
And it's none of your business.

27:51.093 --> 27:54.929
As your investigator, yes.

27:54.932 --> 27:56.816
But as Ben's fiancé, it is my business,

27:56.819 --> 27:58.585
and if you don't tell him, I will.

27:58.588 --> 28:00.400
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Did you just shush me?

28:00.402 --> 28:02.402
Johns and Lobe Law Office.

28:02.404 --> 28:04.504
That's my mother's legal firm.

28:04.506 --> 28:06.472
You think he's targeting Sybil?

28:06.474 --> 28:08.275
If he hasn't killed her already.

28:08.277 --> 28:10.810
How if she's on 24-hour
lockdown in a federal prison?

28:10.812 --> 28:14.847
No, not today. She's being extradited.

28:14.849 --> 28:15.948
Go.

28:23.190 --> 28:26.125
Hello, Sybil.

28:26.127 --> 28:28.160
Your granddaughter sends her regards.

28:49.802 --> 28:50.863
I got him!

28:53.200 --> 28:54.607
Hello, mother.

28:54.610 --> 28:55.935
What on earth are you doing?

28:55.937 --> 28:59.338
Isn't it obvious? It's
a prison break, darling.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.473
Hey, Margot!

29:01.475 --> 29:03.042
Margot, wait!

29:06.313 --> 29:08.113
Should we open the DNA test results?

29:08.115 --> 29:09.515
We need to wait for Margot.

29:09.517 --> 29:11.047
We don't know when she's coming back.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.717
- Or if she's coming back.
- She's coming back.

29:12.719 --> 29:14.986
She wouldn't just leave Tessa here.

29:14.988 --> 29:17.105
- With her step-mother?
- Stop.

29:17.108 --> 29:18.423
- What if Ben is the father?
- Guys...

29:18.425 --> 29:21.960
The DNA results would only
prove Margot is her mother.

29:21.962 --> 29:23.962
You'd be such a better
mother than Margot.

29:23.964 --> 29:25.897
It's true. You would make a great mom.

29:25.899 --> 29:27.432
Both of you just need to stop talking.

29:47.687 --> 29:51.321
1957 Mercedes Gullwing.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.661
It's not every day you
get to steal a classic.

29:57.663 --> 30:03.233
And Chloe's buyer is willing
to pay $4 million for this one.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.268
Rhys, no.

30:05.270 --> 30:06.704
No what?

30:06.706 --> 30:08.371
No to whatever it is you're planning.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.706
Planning? I'm agreeing.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.442
We do the job, Justine makes the arrest,

30:12.444 --> 30:14.677
the car goes back to
the evidence impound.

30:14.679 --> 30:19.082
Where you'll steal it.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.883
I knew we were on the same page.

30:20.885 --> 30:23.120
Much easier to steal a
car from an impound lot

30:23.122 --> 30:25.454
- than from a museum.
- We are not on the same page.

30:25.456 --> 30:27.423
- I'm looking out for us.
- You're looking out for you.

30:27.425 --> 30:30.126
So what if I am?

30:30.128 --> 30:32.962
I deserve a little
something out of all of this.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.277
After all, at the end of it,

30:34.280 --> 30:36.246
you and Alice are gonna run off together

30:36.249 --> 30:38.101
and leave me alone with nothing.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.435
I'm looking out for my future.

30:39.437 --> 30:40.936
I'm looking out for your future.

30:40.938 --> 30:42.638
Justine already thinks
we stole the diamonds.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.540
- If the car goes missing...
- She'll never know.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.037
She will put us both in jail.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.877
You can't keep playing both
ends against the middle.

30:48.879 --> 30:49.878
Trust me, I know.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.114
It's time to pick a
lane and and stay there.

30:52.116 --> 30:53.048
What are you two boys up to?

30:53.050 --> 30:54.450
- Just waiting for you.
- Nothing criminal.

30:54.452 --> 30:55.317
Any sign of Chloe?

30:55.319 --> 30:56.918
Yeah, you just walked right past her.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.621
And we are good to go.

30:59.623 --> 31:01.322
Earwigs in, everybody.

31:05.162 --> 31:07.162
You sexy people ready?

31:07.164 --> 31:09.464
Ready.

31:09.520 --> 31:12.270
Ready.

31:12.273 --> 31:13.168
Ready.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.569
Then let's make some noise.

31:15.672 --> 31:16.837
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:16.839 --> 31:19.907
please exit the building in
a calm and orderly fashion!

31:19.909 --> 31:21.242
Step right this way!

31:21.244 --> 31:23.511
I'll keep them out as long as I can.

31:23.513 --> 31:24.512
You're on, Chloe.

31:24.514 --> 31:27.114
Okay, the cameras are down.

31:27.116 --> 31:29.651
System backup's been degaussed.
I'll meet you in the alley.

31:29.653 --> 31:33.320
I'm at the northwest exit.
Northwest exit is clear.

31:33.322 --> 31:35.622
Nobody moves until I get
the go signal in the alley.

31:35.624 --> 31:36.657
Copy that.

31:36.659 --> 31:39.126
Benjamin, time to go.

31:42.531 --> 31:46.633
A gift from Chloe, and I call shotgun.

31:54.210 --> 31:56.376
We are in position.

31:58.647 --> 32:00.681
I said we are in position.

32:05.687 --> 32:07.620
Those aren't my people.

32:09.379 --> 32:10.790
We can tell them we're FBI, right?

32:10.792 --> 32:13.292
Not without compromising
your C.I. status.

32:24.171 --> 32:25.904
Chloe must've missed one of the alarms.

32:25.906 --> 32:29.642
Chloe doesn't miss a thing.

32:29.644 --> 32:30.945
We've been set up.

32:33.400 --> 32:36.424
I haven't run from the cops
since I was 14 years old.

32:36.427 --> 32:39.222
Got to say that was a first for me.

32:39.224 --> 32:40.557
You think she made us?

32:40.559 --> 32:42.191
I don't usually get made.

32:42.193 --> 32:45.661
Why else would she set us up?
And where the hell is Rhys?

32:47.559 --> 32:50.894
He's at the police impound. What?

32:50.897 --> 32:53.142
It's a lot easier to
steal a car from an impound

32:53.145 --> 32:54.445
than it is a museum.

32:59.856 --> 33:02.391
What are you doing here?

33:02.393 --> 33:05.260
Same thing you are.

33:05.262 --> 33:06.861
You sold us all out.

33:06.863 --> 33:09.431
Rhysy.

33:10.567 --> 33:14.369
So we steal the car for you,
we get pinched by the cops,

33:14.371 --> 33:17.071
you steal it from here and keep
the $4 million for yourself.

33:17.073 --> 33:19.874
Okay.

33:19.876 --> 33:22.043
Why don't we both leave with the car?

33:22.045 --> 33:24.846
Finally partner up
after all these years,

33:24.848 --> 33:27.748
professionally speaking.

33:27.750 --> 33:30.785
You have to admit.

33:30.787 --> 33:33.454
We do have fun together.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.627
I see you picked a lane.

34:14.629 --> 34:16.795
This was payback. She set us all up.

34:16.797 --> 34:18.965
Don't kid yourself. You're
one of the good guys now.

34:18.967 --> 34:20.166
Let's not get too carried away.

34:20.168 --> 34:22.634
I almost shot her in the
head and stole the car myself.

34:22.636 --> 34:25.670
Nice work, Rhys. Nice outfit, too.

34:25.672 --> 34:29.641
Well, you know, just greasing
the wheels of justice.

34:29.643 --> 34:30.943
How did you know?

34:30.945 --> 34:34.146
That Chloe would come here.

34:34.148 --> 34:36.849
He's just that good.

34:36.851 --> 34:38.117
In fact, when our deal is over,

34:38.119 --> 34:40.652
Rhys could have a future as a
full-time consultant to the FBI.

34:40.654 --> 34:43.655
Write a book, Spielberg
could direct the movie.

34:43.657 --> 34:44.790
I think the movie would be

34:44.792 --> 34:47.458
a little bit too sexually
graphic for Mr. Spielberg.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.495
Besides, with Justine as a partner,

34:49.496 --> 34:51.797
who knows what I'm liable to get up to?

34:51.799 --> 34:54.533
I'm going back to work now.

34:54.534 --> 34:58.803
I'll come with you. We
can talk about my future.

35:14.454 --> 35:16.621
Oh, tell me you didn't save my life

35:16.623 --> 35:18.456
just so you can do the honors.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.958
Of course not.

35:20.960 --> 35:21.992
This is for you.

35:21.994 --> 35:24.128
Oh.

35:26.198 --> 35:28.865
And so are these.

35:28.867 --> 35:30.734
I chartered you a jet.

35:30.736 --> 35:34.071
I recommend a destination
with lax extradition laws.

35:35.975 --> 35:39.810
I hardly know what to say.

35:39.812 --> 35:41.312
Why the change of heart?

35:41.314 --> 35:43.880
Let's just say I'm starting
to know what it feels like

35:43.882 --> 35:45.816
to have the fruit of
your loins wish you dead.

35:45.818 --> 35:48.563
She is a clever child, isn't she?

35:48.566 --> 35:49.632
She tried to kill me.

35:49.635 --> 35:51.655
She tried to kill us.

35:51.657 --> 35:54.524
It's actually rather promising.

35:54.526 --> 35:55.759
For the Firm's future.

35:55.761 --> 35:58.227
If I let the child live, she'll
only keep trying to murder us.

35:58.229 --> 36:00.029
But she didn't succeed, though, did she?

36:00.031 --> 36:02.731
Perhaps she didn't want to.

36:02.733 --> 36:04.800
She just wanted her mummy's attention.

36:06.838 --> 36:08.737
Now that's absurd.

36:08.739 --> 36:13.042
Children have difficulty
expressing themselves.

36:13.044 --> 36:14.877
You are the grown up.

36:14.879 --> 36:17.713
It's up to you to mend fences.

36:17.715 --> 36:19.515
It's a bit late for that.

36:19.517 --> 36:22.451
She's furious with me for giving her up.

36:22.453 --> 36:25.855
Believe me, if you'd kept her,

36:25.857 --> 36:27.723
she'd be griping about something else.

36:27.725 --> 36:32.461
Hostility and reproach with
occasional moments of pride...

36:32.463 --> 36:35.230
That's the mother/daughter bond for you.

36:35.232 --> 36:37.299
Did you say pride?

36:37.301 --> 36:41.736
Well, thanks to you, I'm
still breathing, aren't I?

36:41.738 --> 36:43.738
You're welcome.

36:47.978 --> 36:49.344
There is your car.

36:51.414 --> 36:55.783
It's a shame I can't
meet her. What's her name?

36:55.785 --> 36:57.886
Tessa.

36:57.888 --> 37:01.389
I'll send you a postcard
once I've settled.

37:01.391 --> 37:03.825
Perhaps you and Tessa
can come and visit.

37:08.964 --> 37:10.364
Call me if you need me.

37:13.469 --> 37:16.470
Mum.

37:16.472 --> 37:17.971
Um...

37:17.973 --> 37:19.407
what if you stayed?

37:19.409 --> 37:22.776
Just for a while.

37:25.848 --> 37:28.281
I have a feeling I'm gonna
need all the help I can get.

37:34.322 --> 37:37.490
Look, we both know these
test results do not mean...

37:37.492 --> 37:39.960
Yes, they do.

37:39.962 --> 37:42.962
You know they do.

37:42.964 --> 37:45.798
Ben is her father.

37:47.969 --> 37:50.270
And he's gonna want to be her father.

37:50.272 --> 37:52.505
Maybe that's what she needs.

37:52.507 --> 37:55.641
And a step-mother who will kick her ass

37:55.643 --> 37:57.109
and send it straight to juvie

37:57.111 --> 37:58.945
the minute she steps out of line.

38:09.490 --> 38:12.191
Maybe we should take the Nick case.

38:12.193 --> 38:13.825
Where did that come from?

38:13.827 --> 38:17.229
If there's stuff in my life
that I'm afraid to look at,

38:17.231 --> 38:21.666
even for a paycheck, then
maybe I should look at it.

38:24.671 --> 38:27.973
'Cause if you do not make peace with it,

38:27.975 --> 38:31.509
the past will always
come back to haunt you.

38:37.884 --> 38:39.784
What'd she do now?

38:42.787 --> 38:44.653
You got the test results?

38:46.993 --> 38:48.859
I opened it.

38:48.861 --> 38:51.329
I already know she's mine.

39:06.846 --> 39:09.613
How long did it take
you to plan all this?

39:11.425 --> 39:13.759
How do you know it was me and not Felix?

39:13.762 --> 39:15.925
Because Felix was loyal
to my family for years

39:15.928 --> 39:17.187
before someone got to him.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.025
Three months.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.161
Felt like forever.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.199
What?

39:29.201 --> 39:30.867
Nothing.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.137
It's just...

39:34.139 --> 39:35.372
It's my own vanity,

39:35.374 --> 39:39.142
but I find myself feeling oddly proud.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.662
- Of me?
- - No, of me for

39:42.665 --> 39:45.050
not having birthed an idiot.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.418
I can tell you why your
plan failed if you'd like.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.453
My plan to kill you?

39:51.455 --> 39:54.923
Only if you're interested.

39:54.925 --> 39:57.228
I already know.

39:58.429 --> 40:00.829
I underestimated my target.

40:12.676 --> 40:14.142
It's not bourbon, but...

40:14.144 --> 40:16.011
What are you doing here?

40:16.013 --> 40:19.181
I just closed another case,

40:19.183 --> 40:21.683
which means I'm two for two.

40:21.685 --> 40:24.485
They're freakin' loving me in FBI land.

40:24.487 --> 40:28.923
Well, you're very lovable.

40:28.925 --> 40:31.792
I'm even better with a tan.

40:31.794 --> 40:35.963
Our villa has a pool and an ocean.

40:35.965 --> 40:39.267
Yeah, about that.

40:39.269 --> 40:42.103
I'm thinking maybe we should wait.

40:42.105 --> 40:44.905
Why? What's going on?

40:47.043 --> 40:48.275
Allie.

40:48.277 --> 40:52.046
It's not for me to say, but, um...

40:55.384 --> 40:58.052
It's Margot.

40:58.054 --> 40:59.653
You should take that.

41:07.062 --> 41:11.531
Hey. What's going on?
