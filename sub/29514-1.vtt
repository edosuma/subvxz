00:56.157 --> 00:58.457
<i>We are live
at the Angelus Temple,</i>

00:58.459 --> 01:01.226
<i>about to witness the main event
of another roaring service.</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.195
<i>Los Angeles' own angel,</i>

01:03.197 --> 01:05.263
<i>Sister Aimee...</i>

01:05.266 --> 01:08.534
<i>is ready this very moment
preparing to perform a miracle.</i>

01:10.104 --> 01:11.670
<i>I confess.</i>

01:13.007 --> 01:16.341
<i>The lost, they flock
to my temple.</i>

01:22.817 --> 01:24.183
<i>But my gift is fading.</i>

01:26.220 --> 01:28.287
<i>Ladies and gentlemen at home,</i>

01:28.289 --> 01:31.623
<i>Sister is about to heal...</i>

01:33.127 --> 01:35.961
<i>your radio host that
your prayers for Sister Aimee</i>

01:35.963 --> 01:37.863
<i>and this immobile woman
in a wheelchair.</i>

01:37.865 --> 01:40.032
<i>Make her walk, Sister.</i>

01:40.034 --> 01:41.700
You can do it.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.137
- Heal her.
- Yes, Sister! Yes!

01:45.139 --> 01:47.306
- Heal her.
- Heal her.

02:08.863 --> 02:11.062
Did you hear that?

02:11.065 --> 02:12.965
Heal her.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.433
I can hear you.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.069
Moses, you say?

02:17.071 --> 02:18.303
The sea, you say?

02:18.305 --> 02:19.738
Come on, Sister, heal her.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.975
<i>Well, folks,
it looks like the Holy Spirit</i>

02:22.977 --> 02:25.944
<i>has indeed spoken to Sister
Aimee, and asked her to...</i>

02:25.946 --> 02:27.279
- Dear Lord.
<i>- Speak.</i>

02:27.281 --> 02:29.047
I can hear you.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.183
And I shall tell
your servant's tale.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.324
Idaho with a blind baby.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.893
Oh, Sister, a baby!

02:40.895 --> 02:41.960
No.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.228
No blind infants.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.130
God doesn't have it in Him tonight.
I can feel it.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.199
What about a case of
moderate gout?

02:47.201 --> 02:49.301
<i>Like Psalm 142,</i>

02:50.137 --> 02:52.504
<i>I am trapped!</i>

02:52.506 --> 02:54.039
The children will be there.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.909
Uh, police will have to shut down the
pier, because of last time.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.681
Thirty-eight hundred?

03:04.585 --> 03:07.352
We saved 3,800 souls this month?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.687
Bless the Lord.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.688
Praise Jesus.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.223
The numbers went down.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.925
- Oh, Sister...
- Down.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.126
Maybe...

03:14.128 --> 03:18.230
if we went back to
focusing on healing again?

03:34.014 --> 03:35.681
<i>Can't you see?</i>

03:37.518 --> 03:41.353
<i>I'm just like them, now...</i>
Tight fucking...

03:41.355 --> 03:44.289
<i>waiting for a miracle...</i>

03:47.595 --> 03:48.694
Uh, um...

03:49.363 --> 03:50.363
Oh.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.433
I'll leave this here for you.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.536
It's... It's chamomile.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.772
My favorite.

04:05.846 --> 04:06.778
Oh, oh!

04:06.780 --> 04:07.813
The whale, it broke.

04:07.815 --> 04:08.747
Oh.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.881
It was its time, Bobby.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.250
I'm not finished.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.353
I... I'm not Bobby.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.523
- What?
- Kenny.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.559
- Bobby...
- Had to go back to Kansas.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.394
Oh.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.630
Uh, Kenneth Ormiston.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.333
Nice to meet you,
I guess, and your

04:28.335 --> 04:30.369
- blue fingers.
- Oh, it comes with the trade.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.938
You actually have
a little bit...

04:32.940 --> 04:35.073
- Radio grease?
- No, it's ink.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.541
- Oh.
- I'm a writer.

04:36.543 --> 04:37.376
Oh.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.044
Anything I've read?

04:39.046 --> 04:40.212
- Well...
- You should talk to Hazel.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.934
Get you published in
one of our newsletters.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.751
Oh, I'm not...

04:46.587 --> 04:48.186
I don't think
that'd be a good fit.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.888
Most people would say,
"thank you."

04:49.890 --> 04:51.356
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.991
I just... I write about,

04:53.794 --> 04:55.294
um, people.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.795
Not the gods that they create.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.697
What about <i> the</i> God?

04:59.033 --> 05:03.802
Um...
He's a god that they created.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.306
Is he, now?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.441
Oh, um... Ms. McPherson...

05:09.443 --> 05:11.243
- I mean, Sister...
- Aimee.

05:11.245 --> 05:12.711
Aimee.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.714
Look, I have nothing but respect

05:15.716 --> 05:17.249
for people of faith.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.950
It's just that I write

05:20.120 --> 05:22.888
about everyday folk.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.923
You know? Um...

05:24.925 --> 05:26.992
Their lives, their struggles.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.660
Have you ever read Jack Reed?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.495
<i>Insurgent Mexico?</i> No? Okay.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.664
My work is similar
to his, but...

05:33.967 --> 05:35.400
I go more in depth.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.271
I'm currently collecting stories

05:39.273 --> 05:41.740
about the Mexican Revolution.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.009
Why?

05:44.011 --> 05:48.313
You'd have to know Mexico
to understand its significance.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.414
Oh, you're from Mexico?

05:49.416 --> 05:51.516
I'm from Sacramento.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.585
But, you know,
I feel their passions

05:54.088 --> 05:55.454
from afar.

05:56.557 --> 06:00.058
Their writers
and their thinkers...

06:03.297 --> 06:04.596
Ethics.

06:05.466 --> 06:09.067
Men... just yearning
for freedom.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.837
I doubt they need false idols.

06:13.907 --> 06:14.907
No offense.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.080
- Mexico?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.552
And you've never been?

06:28.188 --> 06:29.388
No.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.790
No, but I'm gonna go.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.827
When?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.730
Soon.

06:38.866 --> 06:39.998
I have it all mapped out.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.771
See?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.541
I do see.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.979
Tell me a story then, Kenneth.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.747
Hmm? Hmm?

06:55.749 --> 06:56.782
From Mexico.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.684
Of the... common people.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.823
My wife never asks me
about my work. Um...

07:04.825 --> 07:06.191
- Okay.
- Ooh!

07:06.193 --> 07:07.959
Um...

07:07.961 --> 07:12.931
My favorite is called
<i>A Hero With No Name,</i>

07:12.933 --> 07:13.999
and it takes place...

07:17.271 --> 07:18.603
Close your eyes.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.640
Imagine.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.217
It was the bloodiest days
of the Revolution.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.620
The north is decimated.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.155
Ravaged.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.690
Its people are tired,

07:39.293 --> 07:40.559
starving.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.661
One more defeat, just one,

07:43.997 --> 07:45.931
and their cause is lost.

07:47.951 --> 07:49.968
<i>On a starless night,
the great warrior Pancho Villa</i>

07:49.970 --> 07:52.838
<i>is headed to
the northern battlefields</i>

07:52.840 --> 07:55.040
<i>to lend his voice and his sword</i>

07:56.410 --> 07:58.009
<i>to the wavering fighters there.</i>

07:59.880 --> 08:01.313
<i>When out of nowhere...</i>

08:01.315 --> 08:03.582
<i>five enemy soldiers appear.</i>

08:04.918 --> 08:06.184
<i>He's surrounded.</i>

08:07.588 --> 08:10.255
<i>His fate is all but decided.
He's...</i>

08:13.527 --> 08:14.993
<i>He's a dead man.</i>

08:15.262 --> 08:17.662
<i>When...</i>

08:21.635 --> 08:24.870
<i>Five men, one slice.</i>

08:27.541 --> 08:28.840
Who was it?

08:30.544 --> 08:31.910
No one knows.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.515
Just that he was a tiny fellow,

08:36.517 --> 08:38.783
a boy with no name.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.152
You see, he didn't wanna
be remembered as a hero

08:42.489 --> 08:43.421
or a God.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.590
He wanted his greatest victory

08:45.993 --> 08:47.158
as a warrior

08:48.395 --> 08:49.861
to be a victory for his people.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.030
For Mexico.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.066
My God.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.969
You are good.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.673
<i>Oh, my dearest Hazel.</i>

09:01.675 --> 09:03.542
<i>A miracle has happened.</i>

09:03.911 --> 09:05.110
<i>God spoke.</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:07.245
<i>Sister shall vanish.</i>

09:07.247 --> 09:09.814
<i>Sister Aimee!
Sister Aimee is gone! Help!</i>

09:09.816 --> 09:13.151
<i>And I need
you, my beloved disciple,</i>

09:13.153 --> 09:15.120
<i>to tell my story.</i>

09:17.490 --> 09:19.857
Tell us what happened the day
when you and Ms. Semple McPherson

09:19.860 --> 09:22.227
went down to the beach,
Ms. Zalewski.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.263
Hazel. Everyone calls me Hazel.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.705
BROWN Okay.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.733
Hazel?

09:28.735 --> 09:33.438
Well, we went for
our weekend swim,

09:33.440 --> 09:36.575
as always Saturdays,
at the crack of dawn.

09:36.577 --> 09:41.680
You see, Sister enjoys communing
with God's natures on Saturday.

09:41.682 --> 09:45.216
She once said in one of her
most widely regarded sermons

09:46.553 --> 09:47.986
that she feels closest to God

09:47.988 --> 09:50.722
when she is swimming
in our glorious Pacific.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.458
Exercising the body and mind.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.660
One with the cold underneath,

09:56.496 --> 09:58.129
and the warmth above.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.136
Everything was as it always is.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.775
But then, something
peculiar happened.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.145
Sister was there in front of me,

10:15.382 --> 10:17.315
and then she was gone.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.317
An undertow?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.346
Her legs cramped from the strenuous
exercise and pulled her down.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.859
She evaporated.

10:31.531 --> 10:35.567
Say, like <i> The Little Mermaid?</i>

11:22.749 --> 11:24.315
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.157
My ar... My... My arm.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.959
You're sleeping on my...
Thank you. Ah!

11:37.364 --> 11:38.997
I slept like the dead.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.468
I haven't slept like that in...

11:44.538 --> 11:46.037
I don't even know.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.740
I'll make sure you get your
beauty sleep from here on out.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.880
What do you see?

11:56.349 --> 11:57.349
Mexico.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.287
Oh, I probably think the real thing
will be much more scenic than this.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.056
Than a...

12:05.058 --> 12:07.392
a garbage can
and two alley cats.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.395
Oh, which reminds me.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.366
Look.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.134
Ta-da.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.470
The new you.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.639
- Dot Ormiston?
- Uh-huh.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.242
Wife of Steven Ormiston.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.978
Should we be using
your last name?

12:26.980 --> 12:29.814
Sure. It's just as common
as Smith or Brown.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.783
- Ormiston?
- Yeah.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.817
Oh, hide.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.152
Hide, hide, hide, hide.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.729
Thank you very much.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.298
Just enough eggs
for me and myself.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.300
Bye.

12:49.669 --> 12:50.802
I'm Dot.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.570
Dot Ormiston.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.506
Such a pleasure.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.175
I know. Isn't he wonderful?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.477
No, please, please.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.112
Call me Dotty.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.988
Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm,
hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.323
"Assistant claims
Sister Aimee evaporated"?

13:12.759 --> 13:14.159
Evaporated.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.760
Honey, evaporated isn't drowned.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.462
Well, I wanted to give her
a nice farewell.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.031
Honey, honey.
No, no, no, no, no.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.001
"Evaporated" lets people use
their imagination.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.404
Well, we need to
get out of here.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.472
We need to get out of here.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.007
<i>Mass hysteria in California.</i>

13:29.008 --> 13:30.541
<i>Thousands of people have taken
to the roads and beaches...</i>

13:30.544 --> 13:32.277
Sister Aimee will return!

13:32.279 --> 13:33.912
Sister Aimee will return!

13:41.354 --> 13:43.154
We can't cross the border here.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.263
<i>Let her hear your voice.</i>

13:52.265 --> 13:54.065
<i>Let her know that you believe.</i>

13:54.067 --> 13:56.167
<i>Let her be resurrected.</i>

14:06.179 --> 14:07.245
Uh...

14:07.247 --> 14:10.415
Good day. We're in need
of, um, a map.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.350
Mexico or California?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.018
Arizona, New Mexico, Texas.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.087
We wanna tour all the south-west

14:16.089 --> 14:18.256
before we wind up
down in Mexico City.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.658
My wife only brought
the map for California.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.393
Silly little bird.

14:23.597 --> 14:24.996
- That's a nice car.
- Yeah.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.366
Could easily sit
three, or four...

14:28.368 --> 14:29.601
I suppose so. Um...

14:30.303 --> 14:31.636
Do you have a map?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.777
Maps, they cover the main road.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.945
Great.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.747
- But if you got the money.
- Uh-huh?

14:42.749 --> 14:43.681
A guide's better.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.716
Oh, no.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.484
Someone who knows
the back roads.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.319
No cops to pull you over.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.424
I know someone.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.610
You go meet our cowboy.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.946
<i>Senor</i> Rey?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.949
<i>Senor</i> Rey?

15:18.652 --> 15:19.684
Uh, hello.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.854
Hello.<i> Senor</i> Rey?

15:25.058 --> 15:26.190
Rey.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.895
<i>Hola, Senor</i> Rey?

15:30.897 --> 15:31.897
Who sent you?

15:33.133 --> 15:34.565
Who sent you?

15:34.567 --> 15:35.566
Fruit stand map person.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.468
Un-hand her.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.004
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.239
- You must forgive me.
- She...

15:41.241 --> 15:43.174
You need a guide. I'm Rey.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.244
Oh, you're...

15:46.246 --> 15:47.278
Oh, you're Rey.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.583
Your Spanish is... is wonderful.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.919
Oh. Thank you.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.287
- Steve, sweetheart.
- Hmm?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.389
She's a little extreme,
don't you think?

15:58.391 --> 16:00.792
No, I don't... No, she's a...
She's a woman

16:00.794 --> 16:02.660
who'd just taking care
of herself.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.262
Hell of a grip.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.498
I decide the route. I drive.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.600
I don't like to talk a lot, but,

16:09.602 --> 16:12.637
I do know all 49 species
of cactus in the south-west,

16:12.639 --> 16:13.871
and I will point them out.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.107
Oh! We need to be
in Mexico City in one week.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.742
- Or so.
- One week.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.044
Give me $50 now and $50
when we get to the border.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.412
That's a little pricey.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.982
But first...

16:25.552 --> 16:26.718
Do you recognize this woman?

16:28.521 --> 16:29.554
She's Dotty.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.290
No, just...
Closer look at her face.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.359
Anything familiar?

16:37.998 --> 16:39.197
Are you famous?

16:41.935 --> 16:43.668
I'm sorry.
I don't go to the pictures.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.069
Okay.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.672
I'll go get my bag.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.842
<i>The Lord keeps speaking.</i>

16:55.949 --> 16:57.782
God speaks to her.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.020
Some people would say
she wasn't well.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.255
Well, some people would say
that God is dead

17:04.257 --> 17:07.058
and man is king,
but that doesn't make it true.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.460
Fits in public.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.262
Spasms, fainting spells.

17:11.865 --> 17:12.930
Tap dancing.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.198
- God in her feet, too?
- That's right.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.200
Sometimes he tickles her toes.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.703
Now, why are you
wasting your time

17:18.704 --> 17:22.473
trying to torture me instead
of looking for my daughter?

17:22.474 --> 17:24.809
Because a young woman
died this morning.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.611
One of your
daughter's followers.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.780
She saw her in the waves.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.748
Bless her soul.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.083
Don't stop there.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.252
We also lost one of our divers
trying to rescue her.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.187
- Bless his...
- Bless <i> his</i> soul.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.724
We've now pulled two bodies
out of that water,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.225
and neither one was a preacher.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.094
You're a smart woman,
Mrs. Kennedy.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.631
You know Aimee didn't evaporate.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.367
Now, I know it's mighty hard
to think about, but,

17:49.369 --> 17:52.103
is there a chance
she did this to herself?

17:52.105 --> 17:54.705
That she swam out there...

17:54.707 --> 17:56.140
Okay? Far out.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.609
Where no one will ever find her.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.666
<i>How's
everybody feeling out there?</i>

18:02.248 --> 18:04.248
Are you feeling the lord?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.349
I am.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.784
Oh, I am.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.821
I hear Him calling my name.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.956
"Sister Aimee. Sister Aimee."

18:11.958 --> 18:13.624
"Sister, heal the wounds."

18:14.360 --> 18:16.027
Amen.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.830
I was... I was back
there in the woods

18:19.532 --> 18:21.099
and I heard a voice.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.170
Who here needs to be healed?

18:26.172 --> 18:27.538
Why don't you come inside?

18:33.546 --> 18:36.681
My hands help to heal this man.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.016
Help me, Lord.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.418
Hear my prayer.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.653
Do everything in Your power

18:42.655 --> 18:44.856
and let me heal this man.

18:45.859 --> 18:46.924
What's your name, son?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.126
Heal him. Heal him.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.460
What's your name?

18:49.462 --> 18:52.263
Sister's gathered
134 this morning.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.234
Oh, Lord.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.635
Take me in your power.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.872
Give me strength to
heal young Junior.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.609
Sister, please heal him.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.455
Mother...

19:19.559 --> 19:20.591
Two hundred.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.398
<i>Who's next?</i>

19:30.937 --> 19:31.937
No.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.705
Aimee wants to be found.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.573
Are you all right there, ma'am?

20:09.776 --> 20:10.776
Oh.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.418
I could use a nice...

20:21.154 --> 20:22.153
swim.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.454
That's all.

20:23.456 --> 20:27.058
Well, ma'am.
You're headed the wrong way.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.027
There's no water
in that direction.

20:35.535 --> 20:39.270
Guess I'll just have to make do with
stretching in the desert air, then.

20:41.808 --> 20:42.974
Yes, ma'am.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.342
Peach?

21:24.784 --> 21:25.950
Giddy-up, peanut.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.518
We're burning daylight.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.130
Say, have you ever
been to Mexico City, Rey?

21:39.132 --> 21:40.431
Mmm-hmm.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.500
Some pretty important people
anticipate my arrival.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.002
That's the bluest sky I've
seen in the longest time.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.905
Their work is very
popular in your country.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.540
It's almost turquoise.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.043
Writers, thinkers,
political, uh...

21:52.045 --> 21:53.277
- Cobalt.
- Azure.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.645
Political visionaries.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.330
Who?

21:56.331 --> 21:57.847
Oh, I couldn't reveal their names.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.417
You don't know anyone.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.624
Honey, will you hand me my...

22:08.561 --> 22:09.561
Yeah.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.866
I received a letter

22:16.969 --> 22:18.402
from <i> El Machete.</i>

22:18.404 --> 22:20.104
That's where we're
headed to Mexico City.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.341
They're interested in a
few essays from my book.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.942
- You got it down?
- I did.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.244
You're an observer?

22:27.246 --> 22:29.146
I'm a journalist,
a political commentator.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.081
- Mmm-hmm.
- Of sorts.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.482
Do you know Jack Reed?

22:31.484 --> 22:32.783
I only met him once.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.026
<i>El Machete?</i>

22:42.028 --> 22:43.260
Mmm-hmm.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.096
- Okay.
<i>- El Machete.</i> Okay.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.130
What about your wife?

22:46.132 --> 22:47.832
My, my muse.

22:47.834 --> 22:48.834
That is my muse.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.601
Yes.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.669
The muse.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.377
Azure.

22:59.379 --> 23:03.781
<i>Mother would have called
for a collector of people.</i>

23:04.484 --> 23:06.784
And by "people" I mean men.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.019
Her first husband
died mysteriously.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.588
He died of malaria.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.723
<i>She probably
just swam out too far.</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:14.492
She forgot what God made her.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.793
And what's that?

23:16.329 --> 23:17.628
A female.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.662
Whore!

23:20.233 --> 23:21.799
Some say that she was drunk.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.976
- Mr. Sunday...
- Brother.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.446
Angelus Temple.
You ever been there?

23:35.448 --> 23:36.981
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm?

23:37.650 --> 23:38.783
It's something, isn't it?

23:39.519 --> 23:40.818
Five thousand seats.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.820
I didn't count.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.789
Three services a day,
seven days a week.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.311
Sister sure is popular.

23:50.312 --> 23:52.593
She's the second most popular
religious figure in America.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.965
The Pope's still got
number one spot.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.435
For now.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.170
And you...

24:00.773 --> 24:02.106
are...

24:13.219 --> 24:16.520
The grass withereth,
the flower fadeth.

24:17.723 --> 24:22.092
But the word of our God
shall stand forever.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.761
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

24:24.964 --> 24:26.831
I started out
as a baseball player.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.099
Showed real promise
in the majors.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.935
I hit a couple of records
for stolen bases.

24:31.504 --> 24:34.405
Everyone loves a stolen base.

24:34.407 --> 24:37.608
I was what you would call
a crowd favorite.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.711
So, 5,300 doesn't
mean that much to me.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.247
Do you know
what position I held?

24:43.249 --> 24:44.815
Afraid it was before my time.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.419
Outfielder?

24:48.421 --> 24:49.453
Defense.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.455
That's how I started my career,

24:51.457 --> 24:53.958
and that's how I'm ending it
now, Mr. Brown.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.460
Detective.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.696
Now, Aimee, she thought
herself on the offense

24:59.298 --> 25:02.666
with her 5,300 seats,

25:02.668 --> 25:07.605
and her flair,
and her cheap movie flack.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.118
Who here to see the Lord?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.554
Who here?

25:30.229 --> 25:31.829
Deliver me, Sister!

25:32.164 --> 25:33.931
Deliver me!

25:36.002 --> 25:37.268
Well, with that...

25:38.237 --> 25:40.404
If you gentlemen
would excuse me,

25:40.406 --> 25:43.974
I've traveled a very long way to be
in Los Angeles to pay my respects.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.976
And maybe pick off
a few of her followers?

25:48.481 --> 25:52.216
You can't tap dance your way into
the souls of sinners, Detective.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.586
You'll just end up
in their nether regions.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.223
Steve...

26:00.092 --> 26:01.625
Are you awake, Stevie?

26:09.335 --> 26:11.302
What are you... Shh.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.471
She may hear us.

26:14.473 --> 26:15.406
I don't care.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.674
No. No. But, but, but,

26:16.676 --> 26:18.842
you would, sweetheart.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.011
Dotty would.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.230
Dotty's turning out to
be a real bore.

27:49.535 --> 27:51.001
I'll be right back.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.381
- Stevie.
- Hmm?

28:04.383 --> 28:05.849
Outside.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.805
- Ta-da!
- Oh, dear God!

28:10.806 --> 28:13.246
I knew she was
trouble, and you wouldn't listen.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.900
I mean, look at all of this.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.034
Stop...

28:24.336 --> 28:25.703
Put that...

28:56.502 --> 28:58.068
That car, right?

29:01.373 --> 29:02.773
An old American made Ford.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.409
It was a wedding gift
for my wife.

29:06.645 --> 29:07.845
Good.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.314
Uh...

29:18.624 --> 29:20.157
Kenny.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.292
Kenny.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.426
Come on.
Let's get out of here. Now.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.461
What? No. Come here, come here.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.267
How does an artist
die an early death?

29:30.269 --> 29:31.769
I know how we're gonna
die an early death.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.905
A writer has to
have a follow up.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.840
Okay? <i> El Machete,</i>
they're gonna close that book,

29:36.842 --> 29:39.276
and the first thing that they're gonna
ask me is what am I working on next.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.544
Well...

29:41.647 --> 29:43.280
Ta-da!

29:43.282 --> 29:45.282
I mean, maybe we came
across her for a reason.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.050
- Fate?
- That's right.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.453
- You don't believe in fate.
- Yeah, but you do.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.556
But I do believe that
a story finds its writer.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.425
- I object.
- Overruled.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.860
I have two brothers.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.294
Both in accounts payable
back in Sacramento.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.731
And I imagine you must come
from a whole litter, huh?

30:00.733 --> 30:01.865
- Prickly pear.
- Pardon?

30:01.867 --> 30:03.801
The cactus outside
is a prickly pear.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.869
Oh.

30:05.871 --> 30:08.939
Anyway, there can be a whole
chapter about disguises.

30:10.843 --> 30:13.377
At least a gun smuggler
posing as a man.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.378
The clock.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.579
This is incredible.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.587
God bless you... sister.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.626
That is a horse crippler.

30:29.628 --> 30:30.594
Mmm. Pretty.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.696
Are you from Mexico originally?

30:32.698 --> 30:34.998
'Cause your English,
it's perfect.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.400
I guess that's why
you're a guide.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.937
Have you been a guide long?

30:41.473 --> 30:43.440
- Too long.
- "Too long."

30:47.980 --> 30:49.880
I guess being a guide
is dangerous.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.985
Do you have kids?

31:00.492 --> 31:01.859
You like meat, Dot?

31:05.231 --> 31:06.363
Ye... Yes.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.566
You see.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.977
I'm coming. I'm following you.
I'm right behind you.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.212
We... We got it.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.450
Huge rabbit.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.624
It's blood.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.894
There's so much blood.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.337
<i>Gentlemen,
if you haven't found a body yet,</i>

31:47.339 --> 31:49.506
might you entertain
the notion that

31:50.342 --> 31:52.376
there is none?

31:52.378 --> 31:54.645
What do you mean by
that, Brother McPherson?

31:54.647 --> 31:56.713
Thank you. "Brother"?

31:56.715 --> 31:58.548
No. No, I'm just a...

31:58.951 --> 32:00.017
Harold is fine.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.219
I find it strange
that you aren't...

32:03.255 --> 32:06.390
rattled by the disappearance
of your ex-wife,

32:06.392 --> 32:07.925
mother of your child.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.193
Fellas,

32:10.629 --> 32:11.662
one summer.

32:12.698 --> 32:16.400
I was visited by
a red-tailed hawk.

32:16.402 --> 32:20.037
Every morning I'd go out and smoke a
cigarette on my porch, and there she was.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.471
This beautiful bird.

32:21.473 --> 32:25.042
Just eyeing me from one of the
birch trees next to the pond.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.310
And it got to be quite a habit.

32:26.312 --> 32:29.980
I would leave out a little,
uh, piece of meat

32:29.982 --> 32:32.249
at night and it would be
gone the next day.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.252
Until one morning,

32:36.622 --> 32:37.688
no bird.

32:38.924 --> 32:40.123
It vanished.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.492
Now, if that happened to you,

32:42.494 --> 32:44.094
you wouldn't be rattled
by it, would you?

32:44.096 --> 32:46.196
You'd just think, by golly...

32:48.334 --> 32:49.533
She flew away.

32:56.709 --> 32:58.109
Are you taking the children?

33:00.512 --> 33:01.545
Of course I am, Harold.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.715
Go, go, go, go.

33:06.452 --> 33:07.384
Come on. Come with Mama.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.785
It's gonna be fine.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.654
Just come with Mama. Okay.

33:12.257 --> 33:13.457
Bye, Berta.

33:26.739 --> 33:28.905
<i>You see, Aimee had a...</i>

33:28.907 --> 33:30.507
<i>Well, she had callings.</i>

33:32.444 --> 33:33.877
And she followed them.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.046
So, you think she just

33:37.016 --> 33:38.248
swam away?

33:39.118 --> 33:41.018
Figuratively speaking, yes.

33:41.020 --> 33:44.354
In most cases,
when a lady swims away,

33:45.057 --> 33:46.356
we look to the husband.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.026
And when she doesn't have one,

33:49.495 --> 33:50.660
we look to the ex.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.163
To the...

33:53.899 --> 33:55.332
Okay.

33:57.102 --> 33:58.969
I should take that
as a compliment.

34:01.707 --> 34:05.375
The truth is, if anyone tried
anything funny with her,

34:05.978 --> 34:07.477
my money's on Aimee.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.085
My wife's waiting outside.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.556
Does she have a calling, too?

34:21.493 --> 34:23.592
No.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.464
So, you're saying your father
taught you how to hunt?

34:28.766 --> 34:30.132
She didn't say that.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.069
Did he also teach
you to field dress the hare

34:32.071 --> 34:35.806
with such <i> eficiencia
and, uh, rapida?</i>

34:53.992 --> 34:55.257
What?

34:55.260 --> 34:56.693
No, no, no, no, no.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.299
That limp little boob.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.235
Doesn't even wait
till my body's cold.

35:07.039 --> 35:08.238
Dot, you okay?

35:09.475 --> 35:10.475
Of course.

35:10.776 --> 35:11.808
I'm dandy.

35:12.811 --> 35:13.811
I'm Dot.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.492
<i>Thing about a character</i>

35:28.760 --> 35:32.896
like Rey is that she's an onion,

35:32.898 --> 35:35.365
and she must be
peeled delicately.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.868
One must look for clues.

35:37.870 --> 35:38.869
You're not gonna smoke that

35:38.871 --> 35:40.270
in here, are you?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.306
You've seen the line of trust

35:43.308 --> 35:45.075
that I've built with her.

35:45.077 --> 35:47.344
Hmm. That's key. The subject

35:48.080 --> 35:49.613
has to believe...

35:51.083 --> 35:52.483
in the scribe.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.254
There's a story in here. I know it.
I just have to find it.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.855
- Let me see it.
- Don't! Dotty.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.190
- That's...
- Oh.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.492
"Made tortillas with <i> abuela".</i>

36:02.494 --> 36:03.927
"Rabbit hunt."

36:03.929 --> 36:05.328
"Rabbit dead."

36:05.330 --> 36:06.930
Oh, but, here it is.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.398
"In my observations of Rey,"

36:08.400 --> 36:12.636
"I've come to understand that
the female criminal mind is..."

36:13.539 --> 36:15.272
What? What is it?

36:15.274 --> 36:16.907
You have me on
the edge of my seat.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.208
You don't understand.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.210
It's a process.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.978
I know how to get
a goddamn story.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.446
Oh.

36:24.816 --> 36:25.916
This is the story.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.351
Oh. What is that?

36:28.353 --> 36:30.587
It's the note that
the priest gave Rey.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.423
- Huh?
- I stole it.

36:37.796 --> 36:38.929
Oh. Um...

36:40.332 --> 36:41.531
Well... Well done.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.768
Well done, my muse.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.336
Can I, uh, can I see it?

36:46.538 --> 36:47.571
No.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.273
- Let me see it.
- No.

36:50.275 --> 36:51.575
- Let me see it!
- No!

36:51.577 --> 36:52.709
Give me that...

36:53.245 --> 36:54.511
Ow!

36:54.513 --> 36:56.713
I'm beginning to doubt
these <i> observaciones.</i>

37:02.387 --> 37:04.487
Do you mind? Mine's empty.

37:07.626 --> 37:08.658
Ooh.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.194
Two sips of that and
I'll be flat on my back.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.896
- Give it a try.
- Oh, I will.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.334
Mmm!

37:17.336 --> 37:18.768
That's some authentic stuff.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.271
Rey, you a bootlegger?

37:21.273 --> 37:24.074
I notice that's an awfully
robust knife for a guide.

37:24.076 --> 37:25.308
Mind if I take a look?

37:33.719 --> 37:34.918
Very intimidating.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.588
Circa 1900?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.823
1910.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.024
Issued during the Revolution.

37:41.493 --> 37:42.826
I see.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.027
Military arms.

37:46.164 --> 37:47.764
Five.

37:47.766 --> 37:48.798
What does that symbolize?

37:50.235 --> 37:52.936
Five, um...

38:02.714 --> 38:04.414
Howdy, sir.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.850
Hope you don't mind,
but we saw your fire.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.320
Name's Butch.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.023
That's Peacock, John Jack.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.393
And the Mexican goes
by the name Juan.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.729
Who might you be?

38:19.298 --> 38:20.864
Steve Ormiston.

38:20.866 --> 38:24.567
Well, you wouldn't
mind sharing refreshments

38:24.569 --> 38:27.971
with some lost men,
would you, Mr. Ormiston?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.253
- Yes.
- No.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.375
Have a seat.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.965
A nice car you got
there, Mr. Ormiston.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.684
Thank you.

38:57.685 --> 38:59.402
Thank you. Yeah,
it was a gift for my wife.

38:59.404 --> 39:04.374
I hope you gents
don't mind me saying, but,

39:04.376 --> 39:07.377
I bet you got a story
or two between you?

39:07.379 --> 39:09.679
I'm a bit of
a chronicler of sorts.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.480
You said?

39:10.482 --> 39:12.082
Chronicler, Peacock.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.117
Like a collector.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.119
No.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.886
It's like a writer.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.856
You writing them dirty serials?

39:20.292 --> 39:23.026
No.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.861
Uh, no. More like essays.

39:25.330 --> 39:26.696
Well, we got stories.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.465
Don't we, boys?

39:28.934 --> 39:30.900
Peacock, well...

39:30.902 --> 39:34.437
He's known around these parts
for some unruly behavior.

39:34.439 --> 39:36.573
None of it's been proven in
a court of law, mind you.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.710
John Jack, well...

39:40.712 --> 39:42.545
There ain't a lady
he hasn't tasted

39:42.547 --> 39:44.581
from Mexico up to Montana.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.517
How about Juan?

39:47.519 --> 39:51.020
He cut them Mexicans up like
they were bunnies in the war.

39:51.690 --> 39:52.989
Ha ha.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.108
Slice.

39:55.109 --> 39:57.226
That's why I ain't screwing around
with Juan like Peacock over there.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.662
He ain't one to brag
about his conquests,

39:59.664 --> 40:02.632
but I reckon there ain't
a man, woman, or...

40:03.869 --> 40:06.970
man-woman who ain't
heard of Juan.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.073
Tell 'em who you are, Juan.

40:10.675 --> 40:12.475
Tell 'em what you've done.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.478
I killed five men

40:16.047 --> 40:17.180
with one slice.

40:18.817 --> 40:22.152
Chopped their heads
clean off the shoulders.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.154
One slice.

40:24.156 --> 40:25.522
Come on, now, tell 'em.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.724
It was the bloodiest
night of the Revolution.

40:28.326 --> 40:30.126
One more defeat,

40:30.128 --> 40:31.594
and our cause would be lost.

40:33.331 --> 40:34.864
One starless night,

40:36.268 --> 40:38.635
Pancho Villa was on his way

40:38.637 --> 40:40.870
to the northern battlefields,

40:40.872 --> 40:43.773
to lend his voice and his
sword to the wavering soldiers.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.676
But out of nowhere,

40:47.479 --> 40:49.045
five men attacked Villa.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.217
<i>It was all but decided.</i>

40:56.988 --> 40:58.188
<i>He was a dead man.</i>

40:59.224 --> 41:00.523
<i>But then...</i>

41:05.330 --> 41:06.529
<i>five men...</i>

41:09.234 --> 41:10.700
<i>one slice.</i>

41:21.046 --> 41:22.479
You're the boy with no name.

41:28.553 --> 41:31.421
This is unbelievable.

41:31.423 --> 41:33.623
I need to get my... Get my...

41:39.931 --> 41:42.632
But, uh, wasn't the...

41:42.634 --> 41:45.735
the hero a quick
and slender fella?

41:46.471 --> 41:48.004
No offence, but you're a...

41:48.006 --> 41:49.973
a little big boned,
aren't you, Juan?

41:50.742 --> 41:52.175
- Mr. Ormiston?
- Huh?

41:53.345 --> 41:56.212
Is your lady calling
our Mexican a liar?

41:56.214 --> 41:57.614
What? No!

41:59.718 --> 42:00.718
No.

42:01.286 --> 42:02.519
She's not.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.156
Um...

42:08.426 --> 42:11.261
Friends, would you mind

42:11.263 --> 42:14.030
just letting me pick your
brain for a little while?

42:14.032 --> 42:15.532
Huh? For my new book.

42:17.235 --> 42:19.102
That's all right, Mr. Ormiston.

42:19.104 --> 42:23.740
I reckon we can figure out some form
of reimbursement for our services.

42:23.742 --> 42:25.074
Oh, great, great.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.945
Uh, so it's Peacock.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.214
Peacock.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.249
I mean...

42:33.251 --> 42:35.985
Uh, if you'll excuse me, I think

42:35.987 --> 42:38.121
I'll retire for the evening,
gentlemen.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.358
Have another sip, Mr. Ormiston.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.960
Go on, now. Drink up.

42:44.963 --> 42:46.863
Oh, sure.
I'll take another swig.

43:16.494 --> 43:18.895
I received
a letter from <i> El Machete.</i>

43:19.264 --> 43:21.631
That's why

43:21.633 --> 43:23.766
the three of us are
going there tomorrow.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.169
I like it when they fight back.

44:01.473 --> 44:03.106
Peacock, is it?

44:04.909 --> 44:05.909
No.

44:07.479 --> 44:08.978
I've been on the road before.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.081
Tent revivals.

44:41.312 --> 44:42.712
We need to clean up.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.066
We have to go.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.707
Mmm-mmm. No, I have work to do.

45:11.810 --> 45:13.276
The fellas are
taking me out on a trip...

45:13.278 --> 45:14.678
They left before dawn.

45:15.613 --> 45:16.846
Come on.

45:19.417 --> 45:20.750
They're gone.

45:23.288 --> 45:24.721
Come on.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.593
It's all the same to me,
I got what I want.

45:30.595 --> 45:32.762
- A chapter at least.
- Wonderful.

45:32.764 --> 45:34.197
Maybe even two. Hold on.

45:34.833 --> 45:37.033
You have something. Right...

46:07.298 --> 46:08.298
All right.

46:11.970 --> 46:13.636
Can I get you folks
anything else?

46:13.638 --> 46:14.971
No, thanks.

46:14.973 --> 46:17.273
Dot, these dishes
ain't gonna clean themselves.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.108
Yes, Frank.

46:48.072 --> 46:49.906
Coffee, Sheriff?

46:49.908 --> 46:51.440
Just a drop or two.

46:52.243 --> 46:53.376
Thank you.

47:01.786 --> 47:03.286
Good day.

47:06.124 --> 47:07.190
Good day.

47:09.828 --> 47:11.494
You driving that
sedan out there?

47:12.831 --> 47:14.163
Which one?

47:15.533 --> 47:16.999
What, that maroon one?

47:17.001 --> 47:18.768
- That very one.
- Yeah.

47:18.770 --> 47:21.337
Yeah, I am. That's ours.
That's mine.

47:21.706 --> 47:22.905
Yeah, sure am.

47:22.907 --> 47:24.040
I'm Steven Ormiston.

47:24.042 --> 47:26.209
I'm Steven. Steve.
Just call me Steve.

47:28.112 --> 47:30.580
Looks like you've been
out off the roads there.

47:31.516 --> 47:34.016
Off the roads. Yes, indeed.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.384
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Yeah.

47:35.386 --> 47:37.887
And my husband, bless him,

47:37.889 --> 47:40.523
has agreed to take me
on an adventure tour.

47:40.525 --> 47:42.058
The great yonder.

47:42.060 --> 47:43.243
I see.

47:43.244 --> 47:44.427
I'm a bit of a wild child,

47:44.429 --> 47:47.630
and my husband is more of a
motor court kind of a man,

47:47.632 --> 47:50.800
but he adores me too much.

47:50.802 --> 47:53.002
He even got us
this lovely guide. Um...

47:53.705 --> 47:55.071
Rose.

47:56.808 --> 47:58.474
Rose.

47:58.476 --> 48:03.045
Say, in the yonder, you wouldn't
have come across a group of men,

48:03.414 --> 48:06.182
unseemly crew, vagabonds?

48:06.184 --> 48:09.185
- Oh!
- We've seen absolutely nobody

48:09.187 --> 48:10.219
in ages.

48:10.221 --> 48:13.656
Other than the staggering
variety of cactus

48:13.658 --> 48:16.058
you fine folks have down here.

48:16.060 --> 48:19.829
Did you know that
there are 48 types of cactus

48:19.831 --> 48:21.931
in the state of
New Mexico alone?

48:21.933 --> 48:23.266
I did not, ma'am.

48:23.268 --> 48:25.701
- Forty-eight.
- Forty-nine.

48:25.703 --> 48:27.336
Oh, that's right, 49.

48:29.274 --> 48:32.108
But, um,
should we be on the lookout?

48:32.110 --> 48:34.377
Are these men dangerous, or...

48:34.379 --> 48:36.812
Well, on the account of them
having their throats cut,

48:36.814 --> 48:38.314
I'd say no.

48:38.316 --> 48:39.482
Good Lord.

48:39.484 --> 48:40.683
Bless their souls.

48:42.020 --> 48:44.287
Yep. And keep these ladies safe.

48:44.289 --> 48:46.756
We got a killer out there
slicing people ear to ear.

48:46.758 --> 48:48.024
Yeah.

48:50.662 --> 48:52.328
Well, take care, now.

48:52.330 --> 48:56.032
We sure will keep a lookout
and we do appreciate it.

49:10.415 --> 49:12.281
- We could have given him a name.
- What?

49:12.283 --> 49:14.917
The police. We could've given

49:14.919 --> 49:17.086
a name. We know who killed them.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.823
Juan.

49:20.825 --> 49:22.892
He could've killed all of us,
and now he's out on the loose.

49:22.894 --> 49:24.460
I mean, we could've given
the sheriff a name...

49:24.462 --> 49:27.229
If the sheriff asks,
it's probably better not to say anything.

49:27.932 --> 49:29.432
Don't you think,

49:30.168 --> 49:31.334
Steve?

49:36.140 --> 49:38.107
I think I'll sleep
in the car tonight.

49:38.509 --> 49:40.209
Fine idea, Rey.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.478
Excellent.

50:57.989 --> 50:59.755
Don't believe everything
you read in the papers.

50:59.757 --> 51:02.391
Don't believe everything
a drunk vagabond tells you.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.363
You're the boy with no name.

51:12.870 --> 51:14.737
You must have
one hell of a story.

51:35.793 --> 51:37.426
<i>I'm so sorry, Rey.</i>

51:38.229 --> 51:40.096
What an awful thing for...

51:41.199 --> 51:42.798
No, no, I'm not sorry.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.872
It fit in my hand, so I took it.

52:32.083 --> 52:33.482
And then what?

52:33.484 --> 52:36.152
A week later, I joined
Villa's army in the north.

52:37.054 --> 52:38.721
Never looked back.

52:41.626 --> 52:43.626
And who are you
fighting for now?

52:43.628 --> 52:45.094
I mean, who are

52:45.096 --> 52:47.129
these weapons for, the priest?

52:47.131 --> 52:49.165
He's one of many.

52:49.167 --> 52:52.801
The government started
to issue, um,

52:52.803 --> 52:56.639
a law that restricts religion,

52:56.641 --> 52:58.073
Catholic infantries.

52:58.075 --> 52:59.608
In Mexico?

53:01.279 --> 53:03.946
Oh, in... Mexico.

53:05.283 --> 53:07.216
They're persecuting Christians?

53:07.218 --> 53:08.317
It's a ruse.

53:08.319 --> 53:10.486
They're taking lands.
They want a war.

53:15.326 --> 53:16.859
You're doing God's work.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.327
I'm arming the peasants

53:19.130 --> 53:20.629
who fight for God.

53:21.933 --> 53:23.265
You're a hero.

53:34.912 --> 53:37.279
<i>How you have fallen from Heaven,</i>

53:37.982 --> 53:39.882
oh, star of the morning,

53:40.685 --> 53:42.484
daughter of the dawn.

53:42.486 --> 53:44.320
- Ms. Semple.
- Sister.

53:45.957 --> 53:46.957
Of course.

53:49.193 --> 53:50.593
Note this down.

53:50.595 --> 53:53.529
<i>The Holy Spirit moved
powerfully within my brother.</i>

53:55.433 --> 53:57.533
Aimee was very young
when they got married,

53:57.535 --> 54:00.336
and only 19 when he passed away.

54:00.338 --> 54:04.607
And yet, she was already <i>Aimee.</i>

54:05.576 --> 54:07.343
He would have hated this.

54:19.857 --> 54:20.956
Joy.

54:22.026 --> 54:23.759
Joy is what can heal us.

54:25.896 --> 54:28.564
So, joy is what we must find.

54:44.849 --> 54:46.015
Sister Aimee.

54:49.186 --> 54:51.720
<i>Aimee Elisabeth
Kennedy is nothing more</i>

54:51.722 --> 54:52.855
than a thief.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.925
And I saw where it started.

54:58.763 --> 55:02.164
You shouldn't ask,
"Who stole Aimee?"

55:02.166 --> 55:04.333
You should ask,
"Whom did Aimee steal?"

55:16.847 --> 55:18.580
Cock-a-doodle-do, Dot.

55:27.224 --> 55:28.757
I was getting eaten
alive in that tent.

55:30.995 --> 55:32.561
Surprised you could sleep.

55:34.198 --> 55:35.464
I see.

55:37.268 --> 55:39.101
Oh, I wanna get
to the border today.

55:39.937 --> 55:41.337
Rey, you said today, right?

55:41.339 --> 55:42.604
Yeah, today.

55:43.307 --> 55:44.440
Excellent.

55:45.576 --> 55:46.675
That's...

56:16.307 --> 56:17.840
We have a problem.

56:25.282 --> 56:26.582
Jesus Christ!

56:27.051 --> 56:28.851
Jesus Christ!

56:34.225 --> 56:35.225
I can't risk it.

56:37.828 --> 56:39.828
Maybe I take the car,

56:40.464 --> 56:42.398
- you two take the train.
- No.

56:43.567 --> 56:44.833
No.

56:53.911 --> 56:54.977
He takes the train.

56:57.314 --> 56:58.614
It's my car.

57:00.284 --> 57:01.817
If that works for you.

57:24.675 --> 57:26.241
You missed the turn, Rey.

57:26.243 --> 57:29.044
Oh, sorry. Rey, it was a left.
Rey, it was a left.

57:29.814 --> 57:32.548
Okay, I'm driving.

57:32.550 --> 57:33.682
Rey, you're going the wrong way.

57:33.684 --> 57:35.617
The border is
the other direction.

57:36.754 --> 57:38.921
Where the hell are you going?

57:56.106 --> 57:57.539
Will you give us a moment, Rey?

58:26.770 --> 58:27.770
Hmm!

58:36.347 --> 58:39.181
Ha! So, they figured it out.

58:40.351 --> 58:43.051
Hmm. We're almost
in Mexico, so...

58:43.053 --> 58:45.687
You're going back.

58:45.689 --> 58:48.056
- What?
- You're going back to Los Angeles

58:48.058 --> 58:49.591
to clear this up.

58:49.593 --> 58:50.859
This can't be my legacy.

58:51.629 --> 58:53.095
Ran away with a radio engineer?

58:53.564 --> 58:54.696
But you did.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.666
We're going to Mexico.

58:57.668 --> 58:59.167
<i>I'm</i> going to Mexico.

58:59.169 --> 59:00.569
I am Mexico!

59:03.207 --> 59:04.706
Oh, I see how it is.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.675
First it's Semple,
then it's McPherson,

59:06.677 --> 59:08.677
then it's God, then it's Kenny.

59:08.679 --> 59:11.480
Who's next? That Mexicali rose?

59:11.482 --> 59:14.716
Yeah, how about that?
Let's get something straight, Dotty.

59:14.718 --> 59:17.352
I'm not going back. I am Mexico.

59:17.354 --> 59:18.654
I am <i> El Machete.</i>

59:18.656 --> 59:21.857
I am the reason
that we are all here!

59:26.630 --> 59:27.596
Gag him.

59:27.598 --> 59:29.097
Bind him. Don't be too gentle.

59:30.301 --> 59:31.667
Wha...

59:49.086 --> 59:50.352
May I have it, now?

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:04.766
I know you think
you're going to Mexico.

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:08.003
That <i> El Machete</i> is going to
fawn over your observations,

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:11.740
and that you're going to
be a great, great writer.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:13.342
But, sweetheart,
there's a problem.

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:16.311
You can't see
past your own nose.

01:00:17.548 --> 01:00:18.914
Five.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:21.516
Five soldiers on
a starless night,

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:22.884
on the northern battlefields.

01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:26.088
Or maybe it's four vagabonds

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.889
and one sleeping fool.

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:43.639
Oh, Bobby.

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.841
Don't be too hard on yourself.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.244
You really did
sweep me off my feet,

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:52.147
if only for a little while.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.685
You're going back
to Los Angeles,

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:58.854
and you're clearing this up.

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:01.923
Think of it as your last
chance to tell a great story.

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:04.793
You got bamboozled

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:07.496
into a fake radio conference.
You lost your money,

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:09.197
your pride.

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:11.767
You're gonna give
this note to Hazel.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.103
And you're gonna
go back to your wife,

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.938
and you're never gonna
mention me again.

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:20.409
And if you do,

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.844
just think of
the hero with no name,

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.047
and all the things
she can do to you.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.483
<i>"My trusted friend,".</i>

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:04.319
<i>"God spoke to me again."</i>

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:07.489
<i>"Sister shall have no body,"</i>

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:10.092
<i>"no resurrection."</i>

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:14.129
<i>"She shall die"</i>

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:16.231
<i>"in the ocean."</i>

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.977
<i>"Hazel, recant, will you?"</i>

01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:04.646
<i>"Let Sister die a human,"</i>

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:08.283
<i>"so that at least the spirit
of her precious congregation"</i>

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.918
<i>"can live on."</i>

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.922
<i>"And I, like Isaiah 42:13,"</i>

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:16.525
<i>"shall go forth like a warrior."</i>

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:19.294
<i>I will never return, Hazel.</i>

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.497
<i>"I will never return."</i>

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.572
Mexico looks
exactly like America.

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:39.080
Some parts.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:43.518
It's a big country.

01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:58.099
So, you, uh,
just remembered this?

01:03:58.435 --> 01:03:59.901
Yes.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:03.305
You're absolutely certain?

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:05.540
A shark got her.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.445
All of her.

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:17.485
Sister Aimee is never
coming back.

01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:49.251
<i>Anonymous?</i>

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:50.752
Hmm?

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:52.120
I like the sound.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:55.423
I guess I've never
been anonymous.

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:57.125
Not in a long time.

01:04:57.127 --> 01:04:58.560
What are you talking about?

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:00.395
You're Dot.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:03.498
I need a new name.

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:06.101
Or no name.

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:09.104
Maybe there can be
two heroes with no name.

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:55.984
I tried to say my name,
but no one listened, so I stopped.

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:00.322
They believe me only in death.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:17.372
Better if I go alone.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:33.521
<i>Padre...</i>

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:37.359
<i>Padre.</i>

01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:58.380
<i>Hola.</i>

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:36.084
Let's go.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.469
I'm driving.

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:16.791
Shit.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.596
Relax.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.834
There's nothing left
in the car. Relax.

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:33.541
<i>Hola.</i>

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.678
Officers, is there
a problem with the road?

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.782
Who's Fernandez?

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.453
Mrs. Ormiston.

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:22.557
Would you like to
try that again?

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:29.296
I told you.
I'm just an entertainer, that's all.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:30.966
I tell stories.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:36.504
This isn't the cross
of Christ, then?

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.240
It bears a certain resemblance,

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:41.975
but it's all a costume.

01:09:41.978 --> 01:09:43.778
And look at the beadwork
on that robe.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:46.814
A first class designer in
Hollywood made that for me.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.385
An entertainer.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.532
Rudolph Valentino?

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.668
I did mainly stage productions.

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:08.269
Mmm.

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.077
You understand

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:19.414
that a punishment
for pushing religion

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:23.351
is whatever I choose?

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.288
Oh, that can't be true.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.312
No?

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.934
Please, I'm just
an entertainer, I swear.

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.440
Prove it.

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:55.310
You say you are an entertainer.

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.349
Entertain us.

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:05.787
Tell us a story that
sweeps us off our feet.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.091
For both your sakes.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.120
Usually, there's a...

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.623
More happening. Um...

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:45.727
Uh, there's a band,

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:50.498
and a spotlight or two.

01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:59.407
Who here wants to be healed?

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.416
Who here has killed someone?

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.719
Well, I have.

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:13.188
Who?

01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:19.560
She said she's a murderer.

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:21.396
Who did you kill?

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:26.968
Sister Aimee Semple McPherson.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:29.137
That's who.

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:31.005
I drowned her.

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:34.175
I pushed her

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:39.914
down, down, down, down, down

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:42.417
into the deep, dark,

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.420
blue ocean.

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:46.921
I... put...

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:51.626
Sorry, I'm a little rusty.

01:13:51.628 --> 01:13:53.327
I believe I've seen enough.

01:13:53.329 --> 01:13:54.495
Pedro.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.899
No, no, no, wait.
Just one more story.

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.700
I... Pedro.

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:03.204
You're gonna love this one.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.541
Your last story, Mrs. Ormiston.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.792
Just tell the story.

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:49.851
The day I lost him
was the day I was born

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:53.254
<i>into this life of healing.</i>

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:55.756
I was a widowed mother.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.193
Lost, forlorn.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:01.896
Maybe you know the feeling?

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.053
Take this.

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:30.291
For the car.

01:20:34.564 --> 01:20:35.863
Give 'em hell, Rey.

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:38.165
Given 'em heaven, Aimee.

01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:21.141
Help me!

01:21:21.611 --> 01:21:23.043
Help!

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:25.112
I've been kidnapped!

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:26.714
Please!

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:28.449
I've been kidnapped. Please!

01:21:28.451 --> 01:21:29.817
<i>Help me!</i>

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:31.184
<i>This is KNSP radio.</i>

01:21:31.187 --> 01:21:32.620
<i>A miracle!</i>

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:34.755
<i>Sister Aimee has returned.</i>

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:39.693

<i>She was taken from us,

01:21:46.769 --> 01:21:48.836

McPherson, feared dead...</i>

01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:09.556
A tale that is truly...

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:26.106
I've had a long
and arduous journey.

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:31.178
But the good Lord
guided me back to you.

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.184
So, what do you say?

01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:41.588
Who here needs to be healed?

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:42.790
I love you, Sister!
