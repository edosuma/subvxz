A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

00:46.296 --> 00:49.132
<i>-You don't remember?
-I have no recollection of it whatsoever.</i>

00:51.342 --> 00:52.969
<i>You don't remember at all.</i>

00:56.723 --> 00:57.557
<i>Kill him.</i>

01:06.941 --> 01:07.776
My gosh.

01:08.568 --> 01:12.238
You're covered in sweat.
Are you okay, Jin-seok?

01:13.782 --> 01:15.825
-Mom.
-Yes, Jin-seok.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.953
Jin-seok, it looks like
you had a nightmare.

01:19.037 --> 01:19.913
Dad.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.999
I told you to go to bed early last night.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.668
I said you need to be fully rested
for the early morning move.

01:26.377 --> 01:27.212
Yu-seok.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.799
He went on about how excited he is
about moving to the new house

01:30.882 --> 01:32.383
and couldn't fall asleep all night.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.637
We're almost there.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.472
Dad, what shall we have for lunch today?

01:37.972 --> 01:40.642
It's our moving day,
so we must eat <i>jajangmyeon</i>.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.102
Right. <i>Jajangmyeon</i>, it is.

01:51.444 --> 01:55.365
ONE HEART MOVING COMPANY

02:02.914 --> 02:04.541
<i>I'm seeing our new home
for the first time.</i>

02:05.667 --> 02:07.001
<i>I've never seen it before,</i>

02:08.169 --> 02:10.713
<i>but for some reason,
it doesn't feel unfamiliar,</i>

02:12.257 --> 02:15.426
<i>as if I've seen this house
sometime in the past,</i>

02:16.094 --> 02:18.638
<i>standing right here like this.</i>

02:19.347 --> 02:20.223
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

02:20.598 --> 02:22.350
What do you think? Do you like it?

02:25.603 --> 02:28.565
I'm asking what you think of it.
Is it just like how you imagined?

02:35.530 --> 02:37.574
<i>My brother was always
at the top of his class</i>

02:37.657 --> 02:39.409
<i>since elementary school.</i>

02:40.160 --> 02:43.830
<i>He's a smart guy who graduated
from the top elite university.</i>

02:45.206 --> 02:48.877
<i>He has shown talent in every area
since he was young.</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:53.840
<i>His competitive nature</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:56.759
<i>and good reflexes made him excel
at every sport.</i>

02:57.927 --> 02:58.928
Hey!

02:59.554 --> 03:01.431
<i>And he even has deft hands.</i>

03:01.514 --> 03:04.976
<i>We rarely have to call a handyman
because he can fix most things.</i>

03:06.853 --> 03:08.688
<i>-He neither drinks nor smokes.</i>
-It's fixed!

03:08.771 --> 03:11.357
<i>He has great manners
and never says any vulgar words.</i>

03:11.441 --> 03:14.068
<i>He's logical, yet fun and eloquent
at the same time.</i>

03:14.986 --> 03:18.197
<i>Everyone admired and envied him.</i>

03:19.657 --> 03:22.660
<i>I'm a fan of him too, of course.</i>

03:23.411 --> 03:25.622
<i>No, I deeply admire him.</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:31.336
<i>All the stress from studying gives me
a nervous breakdown from time to time,</i>

03:31.836 --> 03:34.505
<i>and he's the only thing in my life
that I can brag about</i>

03:35.215 --> 03:36.799
<i>and be proud of.</i>

03:36.883 --> 03:37.717
Yu-seok.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.303
Yes. Give it to me, Mom.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.266
<i>A year ago,</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:48.645
<i>he injured his left leg in a car accident,</i>

03:49.479 --> 03:51.064
<i>but to me and my family,</i>

03:52.023 --> 03:54.150
<i>he's still a perfect hero.</i>

03:56.569 --> 03:58.404
-Watch the doorsill.
-Where should we put this?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.198
Oh, this.
At the center of the living room.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.325
-Okay.
-This way, please.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.328
You see the pillar over there?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.914
-Please put it by the pillar.
-Sure.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.333
All right. One, two.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.211
-Please be careful with it.
-Okay.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.091
Where would you like this?

04:18.633 --> 04:21.594
Oh, there are books in that box, right?
You can give it to me.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.724
Okay...

04:39.445 --> 04:41.614
-Hey, drink some water first.
-Bring some water.

04:45.034 --> 04:45.868
Yu-seok.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.121
I thought you were getting your own room.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.206
Oh, I guess you haven't heard about it.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.835
The previous owner left his stuff
in the small room upstairs.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.506
Does that mean
we'll never be able to use that room?

04:58.589 --> 05:00.049
No, I don't think so.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.677
I heard that he practically begged Dad.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.096
Dad obviously couldn't say no
because he's tenderhearted.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.889
I'm sure he'll empty it out soon.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.686
It looks like you hate the idea
of sharing a room with me.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.646
Yes, I do.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.316
I knew it. I could totally tell.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.777
I was kidding. I was just curious.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.529
Yu-seok.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.366
-Yes, Mom.
-Can you come down and help me?

05:27.368 --> 05:28.453
Oh man.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.205
-Dumbass
-Gosh!

05:31.289 --> 05:33.916
I told you not to hit my head.
It kills brain cells!

05:34.417 --> 05:35.501
It doesn't!

05:41.799 --> 05:42.842
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.177
Where should I put this?

05:44.761 --> 05:48.014
-Oh, that... Just by the bed, please.
-Sure.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.227
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.230
Oh man.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.275
-Thank you.
-No worries. It's our house anyway.

06:01.819 --> 06:05.323
By the way, is the guy who just went
downstairs your older brother?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.158
Yes. Why do you ask?

06:08.785 --> 06:09.827
He's your older brother?

06:12.622 --> 06:14.165
I know. We don't look alike, do we?

06:14.248 --> 06:17.126
How old is he?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.586
-Why do you ask?
-Excuse me.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.714
Someone is looking for you in the kitchen.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.049
Oh, okay.

06:28.805 --> 06:29.639
Oh god.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.184
Jeez.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.354
Oh, boy. I'm exhausted.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.692
There you go. Jin-seok.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.028
What do you think of the house?
Do you like it?

06:44.612 --> 06:46.030
I already told you that I do, Mom.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.824
Really? Do you really like it?

06:48.282 --> 06:50.993
-Well...
-Goodness. He loves it,

06:51.077 --> 06:53.037
except for having to share a room with me.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.457
-Gosh, seriously.
-It won't be for long.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.168
The previous owner said
that he'll get his stuff in a month.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.004
Gosh. Don't worry, Dad.
Yu-seok was just kidding.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.799
Earlier, you said yes
without even a second's hesitation.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.843
What? When?

07:07.301 --> 07:10.221
It will be good.
When you're stuck while studying,

07:10.304 --> 07:12.390
you can ask Yu-seok right away.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.727
Oh, Dad. What kind of things
did the previous owner leave in the room?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.814
I'm not sure. They're probably just things
that he used before.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.358
Like what? Do you have any idea?

07:22.859 --> 07:25.236
Well, I'm saying this just in case.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.238
You guys absolutely cannot go
into that room.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.366
He kept telling me
not to go into the room.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.079
Jin-seok. You're taking
your medication every day, right?

07:35.371 --> 07:37.707
Yes, of course. I never forget to take it.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.466
What was that sound?

07:48.342 --> 07:49.510
What sound?

07:49.594 --> 07:51.220
I just heard something from upstairs.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.889
It sounded like something heavy falling.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.515
Wasn't it thunder?

07:55.099 --> 07:56.267
No, it wasn't.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.811
Isn't that where the small room is?

07:59.979 --> 08:01.731
Yes, that room is right above here.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.941
Wasn't it thunder though?

08:04.734 --> 08:05.735
If it was....

08:08.946 --> 08:10.823
-See? It must have been thunder.
-Yes.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.825
I guess.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.078
It's supposed to rain a lot
until tomorrow morning.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.916
Thank goodness the rain didn't start
until after our move.

08:20.833 --> 08:21.667
That is true.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.795
-Gosh, that would've been so stressful.
-Totally.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.701
Don't worry too much.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.079
About what?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.499
You'll definitely pass the exam this year.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.878
Don't you think
that this house gives off good vibes?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.636
Oh god.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.138
I should go to sleep now.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.446
<i>You guys absolutely cannot go
into that room.</i>

11:11.170 --> 11:13.172
-Yu-seok.
-What are you doing here?

11:13.964 --> 11:16.133
Hey, I keep hearing strange sounds
coming from this room.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.637
-Strange sounds?
-Yes, that's right.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.189
-You hear it too, right?
-I don't hear anything.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.650
You don't hear it?

11:39.156 --> 11:41.409
I definitely heard it.
I really heard it a few minutes ago.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.911
You just don't want to study, right?

11:43.994 --> 11:45.162
No, that's not why.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.123
I totally heard weird sounds
a few minutes ago.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.207
All right, I heard you.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.543
You need to get some fresh air
when that happens.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.170
What? It's pouring outside.
Where are we going?

11:53.629 --> 11:54.839
We can take an umbrella.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.510
The lady next door told me that
from the top of the hill over there...

12:03.806 --> 12:05.766
Look at the rain pouring down.

12:09.019 --> 12:09.854
Yu-seok.

12:10.938 --> 12:11.772
Yes.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.733
Thanks.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.446
For what?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.739
-I just wanted to say it.
-Dude.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.616
Don't be silly.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.001
Hello?

12:33.836 --> 12:34.670
Yes, Dad.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.798
Yes, we just came out for a walk.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.843
Right.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.261
That thing?

12:46.140 --> 12:48.017
Okay, I'll head back home now
to find it for you.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.102
All right.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.938
-Was it Dad?
-Yes.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.983
He asked me for a document a while ago.
He wants to take a look at it now.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.528
I'll be right back.
Wait here for a few minutes.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.781
-It's okay. I'll go with you.
-No, it won't even take ten minutes.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.160
-Wait just a few minutes, okay?
-All right, then.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.248
Who are you guys?

14:15.980 --> 14:16.814
Get him!

14:26.115 --> 14:27.032
Yu-seok!

14:27.616 --> 14:29.034
-Take him.
-Oh my god.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.454
Yu-seok!

14:39.086 --> 14:40.921
Yu-seok!

14:54.393 --> 14:55.603
07JO8911

14:55.686 --> 14:57.521
It's "07JO8911."

14:57.605 --> 15:01.191
It's "07JO8911."

15:09.074 --> 15:09.909
Jin-seok.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.286
What happened to you?

15:12.661 --> 15:14.622
They took him. Yu-seok...

15:15.331 --> 15:16.332
Yu-seok has been abducted.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.959
-Hey, Jin-seok.
-Jin-seok!

15:20.377 --> 15:21.337
Hey.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.256
-Jin-seok, wake up. Jin-seok.
-Hey.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.364
<i>Kill him.</i>

15:53.202 --> 15:55.079
Jin-seok, are you all right?

15:57.539 --> 15:58.749
Mom.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.543
Yes, it's me. Are you okay?

16:05.255 --> 16:07.424
Yu-seok... What happened to Yu-seok?

16:08.384 --> 16:10.469
He's not back yet.
We haven't heard anything from him.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.637
Oh, no.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.055
-Did you call the police?
-Yes.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.475
Detectives will be here soon. They want
to hear about what happened from you.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.691
Okay.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.320
Do you remember any of those men's faces?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.156
No.

16:31.865 --> 16:35.035
It was raining. It was also dark,
and I was too flustered

16:35.953 --> 16:37.413
to see their faces clearly.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.126
But like I told you,
I did see the license plate number.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.586
It was "07JO8911," a black van.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.799
This is so frustrating.
That license plate number doesn't exist.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.428
That can't be. I'm sure of it.
It was "07JO8911."

16:52.678 --> 16:55.097
No black van in the country...

16:55.389 --> 16:57.891
I mean, there is no vehicle
with such a license plate number.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.936
That's impossible, Detective.
I clearly saw "07JO8911."

17:01.020 --> 17:04.732
No, that number doesn't exist.
We even tried looking up similar numbers,

17:05.065 --> 17:06.692
but we didn't find any black van.

17:08.986 --> 17:13.532
If you saw it in pouring rain
when it was dark,

17:13.615 --> 17:15.576
it's possible that you read it wrong.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.457
We heard that you're currently
on anti-anxiety medication.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.167
I told you that I'm sure of it.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.294
I said, "07JO8911." It was a black van!

17:25.627 --> 17:26.670
Jin-seok.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.630
That's enough for today.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.425
My son isn't physically well.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.677
I think it was too much
for him to take in.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.763
Okay. We'll wrap up for today, then.

17:37.931 --> 17:38.766
<i>Then,</i>

17:39.933 --> 17:42.644
<i>the torturous waiting game began.</i>

17:53.155 --> 17:54.364
<i>One day.</i>

17:55.574 --> 17:56.408
<i>Two days.</i>

17:59.078 --> 17:59.995
<i>Then a week.</i>

18:02.873 --> 18:03.749
<i>Ten days went by.</i>

18:04.750 --> 18:05.751
<i>While two weeks passed by,</i>

18:05.834 --> 18:08.212
<i>the police gradually became numb
from the boredom.</i>

18:08.796 --> 18:11.381
<i>The number they became,</i>

18:12.466 --> 18:13.967
<i>the more anxious my parents and I grew.</i>

18:54.591 --> 18:55.425
<i>Kill him.</i>

18:58.387 --> 19:01.181
<i>And every night,
I saw that man in my dream.</i>

19:01.849 --> 19:05.602
<i>He looked familiar for some reason,
but I had no idea who he was.</i>

19:06.687 --> 19:09.898
<i>All I knew was the fact that he seemed
extremely agonized in my dreams.</i>

21:42.592 --> 21:43.927
<i>In the morning</i>

21:46.430 --> 21:48.432
<i>of exactly the 19th day
after Yu-seok was abducted,</i>

21:49.891 --> 21:51.184
<i>he came back.</i>

21:58.275 --> 21:59.109
<i>However,</i>

22:00.485 --> 22:02.821
<i>he had no recollection
of what had happened</i>

22:03.196 --> 22:04.573
<i>in the past 19 days.</i>

22:08.702 --> 22:10.871
Is there anything specific you remember...

22:10.954 --> 22:13.498
<i>The doctor said that it's caused
by dissociative amnesia.</i>

22:14.333 --> 22:15.876
<i>Yu-seok</i>

22:16.084 --> 22:17.794
<i>had completely wiped out
the painful memories</i>

22:18.045 --> 22:20.255
<i>from that day.</i>

22:21.548 --> 22:22.382
<i>The doctor also said</i>

22:23.300 --> 22:28.472
-<i>that the only thing we can do is wait.</i>
-Was there a physical shock on the head?

22:35.353 --> 22:36.354
Yu-seok, are you asleep?

22:39.066 --> 22:39.900
No.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.904
We were really worried about you.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.200
I'm sorry.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.537
Don't be. I'm more sorry.

22:56.124 --> 22:56.958
Sweet dreams.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.090
Thanks. You too.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.757
I made kimchi stew, so just heat it up.
Don't order <i>jajangmyeon</i>! From Mom

24:50.197 --> 24:51.573
Jin-seok, what are you doing there?

24:52.407 --> 24:53.241
Hey, Yu-seok.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.912
Nothing. Did you have a good sleep?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.790
I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.672
It's so good.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.594
<i>Jajangmyeon</i> is the best.
What Korean doesn't love <i>jajangmyeon</i>?

25:20.101 --> 25:22.854
Oh, hey. Where did you go last night?

25:24.940 --> 25:25.857
Last night? Who?

25:29.194 --> 25:31.947
You. You stepped out last night.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.784
No, I didn't.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.373
You did. I heard you leaving
and even heard the gate.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.713
You had a dream, didn't you?

25:49.339 --> 25:51.800
It looked like
you were dreaming last night.

25:55.845 --> 25:56.680
Was it a dream?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.599
I should go. I'd better get going now.

25:59.808 --> 26:00.642
-You're done?
-Yes.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.561
I have to go now,
so clean this up for me, okay?

26:03.812 --> 26:05.522
Gosh, seriously. All right.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.357
-See you later.
-Have a good day.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.407
Yu-seok.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.450
Yes.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.619
What happened to your leg?

26:22.622 --> 26:23.748
What do you mean?

26:24.124 --> 26:25.750
What's up with the limp in your right leg?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.299
-Was that how I walked?
-Yes, just now.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.308
Hey, I really have to get going.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.059
Stop joking around, okay?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.244
Which option is most suitable for B?

27:12.255 --> 27:14.174
-Hey, have a seat.
-Hi, Dad.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.761
Jin-seok, don't eat meat only.
You need to eat vegetables, too.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.304
I must eat braised short ribs first.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.765
-This first.
-You have to eat everything.

27:21.848 --> 27:22.932
I'm home.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.684
-Come join us.
-Hey, you.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.896
-You haven't eaten yet, right?
-No, I haven't. I'm starving.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.440
-Is it braised short ribs?
-Yes. It's delicious.

27:35.904 --> 27:36.738
Jeez.

27:36.863 --> 27:37.864
Did you have a good sleep?

27:38.073 --> 27:39.199
I wasn't sleeping.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.117
-You totally were.
-No, I wasn't.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.372
I should go to bed now.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.379
Just lie down and sleep if you're sleepy.
Why are you sleeping at your desk?

27:52.504 --> 27:53.630
Just go to bed.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.007
I wasn't sleeping.
I was thinking about something.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.593
Good night.

30:31.871 --> 30:32.705
Hello.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.791
-Sir, please follow that taxi.
-Sorry?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.001
-That one. Hurry up. We can't lose it.
-Okay.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.286
Boss is here. Come out, guys.

32:27.862 --> 32:28.947
Hello, Boss.

32:29.530 --> 32:30.365
You, go inside.

32:31.741 --> 32:32.992
You fucking morons.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.496
You guys won't
take care of things properly?

32:36.829 --> 32:37.914
We're sorry, Boss.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.209
-How many places?
-Two.

32:42.043 --> 32:45.922
Fuck. I'm already losing my mind
because things got complicated enough.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.591
It's possible that you read it wrong.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.010
We didn't find any black van.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.178
Got it, Boss.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.765
Is handling government jerks
that hard for you guys?

32:58.851 --> 32:59.686
One more thing.

34:06.669 --> 34:07.879
What the fuck?

34:08.921 --> 34:11.299
Why did you have to come here
and complicate things even more?

34:12.633 --> 34:13.843
Well, it's...

34:14.886 --> 34:15.720
I didn't mean to.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.972
Jeez, are you a dimwit or what?

34:18.681 --> 34:21.809
Our boss has been putting so much
work into you. Must you do this?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.729
Well... It looks like
there is some misunderstanding here.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.277
-That rat...
-Get him!

34:33.905 --> 34:34.906
Fuck!

34:36.574 --> 34:38.159
Hey!

34:39.952 --> 34:40.787
Hey!

34:40.870 --> 34:41.704
Stop!

34:42.246 --> 34:43.081
Hey!

34:54.926 --> 34:55.760
Get him!

35:05.186 --> 35:06.020
Damn it.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.759
-Where did he go?
-Fuck. We're screwed.

35:37.677 --> 35:38.761
I saw him going this way.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.889
That prick doesn't even know this area.
He won't be able to go far.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.354
Hey.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.981
Check if he went that way.

35:50.356 --> 35:51.357
I'll go this way.

36:54.253 --> 36:55.630
Hey, did you stay up all night?

36:59.550 --> 37:00.426
What's wrong?

37:03.930 --> 37:06.140
-What?
-Why are you so startled?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.059
Did something happen?

37:10.811 --> 37:11.687
No.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.482
Nothing... Nothing happened.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.652
Hey, Jin-seok.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.706
Jin-seok.

37:33.000 --> 37:33.834
What's going on?

37:35.503 --> 37:36.629
Are you okay, Jin-seok?

37:37.797 --> 37:38.631
Jin-seok.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.508
Hey, can you...

37:42.718 --> 37:44.470
Jin-seok, open this for a second.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.432
Please? Hey, open the door.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.101
Get lost!

37:53.813 --> 37:55.481
All right. I'll leave you alone.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.276
But just tell me why you're being
like this all of a sudden.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.152
Last night...

38:01.279 --> 38:02.822
I followed you out.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.491
You followed me? To where? Where did I go?

38:05.992 --> 38:09.328
You know that I fell asleep
as soon as I got home.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.621
I saw everything.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.583
Tell me. Who are those guys?
They aren't detectives, right?

38:15.001 --> 38:18.379
Who? What are you talking about?
Which detectives?

38:18.462 --> 38:20.339
Those men who chased me last night!

38:26.304 --> 38:28.681
Jin-seok. By any chance, are you...

38:29.974 --> 38:32.727
-If you're having weird dreams again...
-Shut up!

38:34.979 --> 38:35.813
Dreams?

38:36.605 --> 38:37.440
It wasn't a dream.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.275
I remember everything so vividly.

38:40.526 --> 38:41.986
You thought I was asleep, didn't you?

38:42.528 --> 38:45.531
I was asleep until I heard the sound
from the mechanical pencil.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.284
What mechanical pencil?

38:48.367 --> 38:51.037
You kept clicking it and made the lead
fall right in front of my eyes!

38:55.583 --> 38:56.500
Where is my brother?

38:59.587 --> 39:01.297
What have you done to Yu-seok?

39:04.467 --> 39:05.301
Answer me!

39:50.429 --> 39:52.139
-Let go!
-Put that down.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.557
Let go!

39:55.893 --> 39:57.228
-Just a second.
-Let go of me.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.688
-Wait. Calm down, please.
-Let go.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.565
-Please...
-Let go of me, you prick!

40:01.690 --> 40:03.567
-Let go, you son of a...
-Jin-seok, calm down.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.611
Calm down, please.

40:05.986 --> 40:07.655
-Let go of me!
-Please calm down.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.407
-Let go!
-Please...

40:09.657 --> 40:11.617
Jin-seok. Please calm down, okay?

40:11.700 --> 40:14.787
-Don't you dare try to pull a trick on me!
-Jin-seok, calm down!

40:15.329 --> 40:18.833
I'm telling you the truth.
I really didn't go anywhere last night.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.292
Then what were the things I saw?

40:20.543 --> 40:22.878
Who were those guys,
and what did they do to me?

40:23.045 --> 40:24.880
Please calm down. Hear me out, okay?

40:25.089 --> 40:27.425
Jin-seok. None of that happened, okay?

40:28.300 --> 40:31.220
From the pencil to the taxi you took,
and those men that chased you.

40:31.303 --> 40:34.098
None of that actually happened.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.436
Then what about the things
that I remember?

40:38.978 --> 40:41.272
I remember everything so clearly.
How will you explain that?

40:41.355 --> 40:43.816
Jin-seok, your medication.

40:45.734 --> 40:48.404
Did you take your medication yesterday?
Answer me.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.702
Jin-seok, what are you doing there?

40:56.787 --> 40:57.997
Nothing.

41:05.421 --> 41:06.755
You didn't take it, did you?

41:30.779 --> 41:31.655
Yu-seok.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.788
I'm sorry.

41:42.249 --> 41:45.336
Mom will be home soon.
Try to get some rest.

41:47.838 --> 41:48.672
Okay.

42:25.918 --> 42:26.794
Hello?

42:45.771 --> 42:47.022
I'm on my way now, so just wait.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.824
The taxi you took
and those men that chased you.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.743
None of that actually happened.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.998
I've never told him about taking a taxi.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.713
Jin-seok, I'm back.

43:12.006 --> 43:12.840
Mom.

43:14.550 --> 43:15.718
Yes.

43:18.095 --> 43:18.929
What's up?

43:22.600 --> 43:23.434
Well...

43:24.852 --> 43:26.270
About Yu-seok...

43:29.690 --> 43:30.608
Did that...

43:33.193 --> 43:35.821
Did that really happen?

43:35.904 --> 43:38.782
Yes. It actually happened. I'm sure of it.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.452
I should talk to Dad about it.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.746
No, Mom. Don't tell Dad yet.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.624
-We should tell him...
-No. Listen to me, Mom.

43:47.207 --> 43:50.002
If he steps out again tonight,

43:50.711 --> 43:52.838
we should wake Dad up
and follow him together.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.096
Yu-seok...

44:03.098 --> 44:06.310
You're saying
Yu-seok really did that, right?

44:08.520 --> 44:11.482
That guy isn't Yu-seok.

46:16.231 --> 46:17.441
Why didn't you pick up earlier?

46:18.108 --> 46:19.568
Get back soon. We have a big problem.

46:21.862 --> 46:24.156
I think that punk has figured it out.

46:28.744 --> 46:29.578
Yes.

46:31.747 --> 46:32.581
Right.

46:35.459 --> 46:36.293
That's right.

46:39.129 --> 46:39.963
Yes.

46:48.013 --> 46:51.517
He clearly told me
that you aren't his brother.

46:53.727 --> 46:57.814
He also told me everything he saw
when he followed you last night.

46:59.399 --> 47:02.486
He said that your legs were fine
and that the detectives were fake.

47:03.111 --> 47:05.531
Then he said he woke up at home
after being chased for a while.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.491
He clearly told me so.

47:08.617 --> 47:11.537
Yes, I'm telling you.
He definitely told me...

47:17.334 --> 47:18.168
Yes.

47:19.086 --> 47:19.920
Right.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.215
Yes, I know.

47:25.884 --> 47:26.802
That's true.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.223
So, what I'm saying is...

47:39.773 --> 47:40.899
Is someone there?

47:43.902 --> 47:45.112
Is that you, Jin-seok?

47:52.244 --> 47:53.704
Is anyone there?

48:06.258 --> 48:08.594
No, I definitely heard something.

48:09.761 --> 48:11.305
You think he might have come downstairs?

48:12.222 --> 48:14.600
He's sound asleep upstairs right now.

48:16.184 --> 48:18.437
I saw it with my own two eyes
a little while ago.

48:18.770 --> 48:20.897
All right. I'll check his room.

49:36.264 --> 49:39.851
Mr. Park, what's taking you so long?

49:46.942 --> 49:49.778
Do you even know what's happening now?
Get back here immediately.

49:50.278 --> 49:51.613
Mr. Choi is on his way back too.

51:06.897 --> 51:07.939
Are you just waking up now?

51:23.079 --> 51:26.374
You're covered in sweat.

51:28.168 --> 51:29.461
Totally covered.

51:56.071 --> 51:58.281
You need to hurry. Get back immediately.

52:00.367 --> 52:03.495
My cover has been blown, too.

52:44.244 --> 52:46.329
Jin-seok, are you going somewhere?

52:49.291 --> 52:50.125
Dad.

52:52.043 --> 52:53.670
Where are you going?

53:00.051 --> 53:01.678
I'm stepping out to see a friend.

53:03.471 --> 53:04.598
I see.

53:06.558 --> 53:08.476
-Yes.
-Which friend?

53:13.440 --> 53:15.442
Which friend are you meeting?

53:17.777 --> 53:19.696
You probably don't know him.
I'll be back shortly.

53:21.072 --> 53:22.157
Jin-seok.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.703
You absolutely can't leave.

53:35.879 --> 53:36.755
Let's go inside.

53:38.256 --> 53:39.883
Let's talk inside.

53:41.801 --> 53:43.762
I said we should go inside.

53:45.931 --> 53:46.973
Get him!

53:48.516 --> 53:50.143
Don't let that bastard get away!

54:45.532 --> 54:46.866
-What's happening?
-Please help me.

54:46.950 --> 54:49.744
-Help me, please!
-What's the matter with this man?

54:49.828 --> 54:50.662
Shit.

54:55.166 --> 54:57.377
-Stop bullshitting.
-You said it yourself earlier.

54:57.669 --> 54:59.963
Guys, take turns. I'll ask some questions.
First, your name.

55:01.089 --> 55:02.173
I'm Je-hyeong Yeon.

55:02.257 --> 55:03.967
Mr. Je-hyeong Yeon.

55:06.678 --> 55:09.639
All right. I'll try to summarize
what you told us.

55:10.265 --> 55:11.099
In short,

55:11.891 --> 55:14.978
some people have been confining you
for over a month,

55:15.395 --> 55:17.647
and you just escaped.

55:18.231 --> 55:19.315
Yes, that's right.

55:20.233 --> 55:22.527
You were confined
in the two-story house over there,

55:23.611 --> 55:26.573
and those people have been fooling you,
pretending to be your family.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.033
Yes, that's correct.

55:28.408 --> 55:31.661
In other words, you thought
that they were your family,

55:31.745 --> 55:32.620
your birth family.

55:33.329 --> 55:35.331
Yes. I did, but...

55:35.915 --> 55:37.709
-Well...
-Why did you believe them?

55:38.209 --> 55:41.337
Just pretending to be your family
shouldn't be enough to actually fool you.

55:41.921 --> 55:43.965
I really can't understand it, either.

55:44.215 --> 55:45.050
Why...

55:45.508 --> 55:48.053
Why did I believe their lies? I can't...

55:48.136 --> 55:49.596
All right.

55:50.263 --> 55:52.557
-Did you find him in the system?
-Yes, sir.

55:52.849 --> 55:54.184
We already confirmed his identity.

55:54.267 --> 55:57.353
Then you should've brought it to me
right away. What were you waiting for?

55:57.437 --> 55:58.772
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Give it to me.

56:00.648 --> 56:01.649
Is there anything notable?

56:02.275 --> 56:07.197
Your social security number is
770427-1665177.

56:07.655 --> 56:09.741
-Right?
-Yes, that's me.

56:09.908 --> 56:12.911
No missing person report
and no criminal record.

56:13.495 --> 56:14.788
There isn't really anything here.

56:15.997 --> 56:19.209
If you were born in 1977,
that means you're 41 now.

56:20.919 --> 56:21.753
Pardon?

56:22.587 --> 56:23.755
I'm 21.

56:24.964 --> 56:26.424
Goodness. Look.

56:27.133 --> 56:29.552
How can you be 21 this year
when you were born in 1977?

56:30.136 --> 56:33.223
It's 1997, so I am 21 years old.

56:38.645 --> 56:39.479
Mister.

56:40.396 --> 56:43.149
Take a good look at the calendar
over there and repeat after me.

56:45.860 --> 56:48.446
This year is 2017.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.249
Oh god.

56:59.999 --> 57:03.169
You obviously have a problem,
a serious problem.

57:16.474 --> 57:19.978
Oh, hey. Turn on the TV.
The news must be on now.

57:20.061 --> 57:21.020
Yes, sir.

57:22.397 --> 57:25.316
<i>The President's visit to the United States
was formally to discuss</i>

57:25.400 --> 57:27.861
<i>the two countries' relationship
as well as other issues at hand,</i>

57:27.944 --> 57:31.030
<i>but it's said that
he received royal treatment.</i>

57:31.322 --> 57:34.409
<i>President Trump opened the banquet hall,
which is unprecedented,</i>

57:34.701 --> 57:36.327
<i>and he also showed President Moon</i>

57:36.703 --> 57:38.913
<i>around some of the private areas
at the White House.</i>

57:38.997 --> 57:41.374
<i>Reporter Yeong-tae Jeong,
who is there now, will tell us more.</i>

57:41.749 --> 57:43.376
<i>The United States Armed Forces Honor Guard</i>

57:43.501 --> 57:46.087
<i>lined up at the south entrance
of the White House.</i>

57:46.463 --> 57:48.256
<i>Such treatment is only given
to state guests.</i>

57:49.299 --> 57:52.886
<i>Although they hadn't discussed
what they would be wearing,</i>

57:53.136 --> 57:55.013
<i>both presidents were clad
in navy suits and...</i>

59:13.258 --> 59:14.259
Come out!

59:15.051 --> 59:16.052
Let's talk.

1:00:43.431 --> 1:00:46.142
What... What happened here?

1:00:49.187 --> 1:00:50.688
Our plan failed once again.

1:01:13.336 --> 1:01:14.295
Who are you guys?

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.340
That's all you want to know?

1:01:19.133 --> 1:01:21.386
I bet there are a ton of other things
you're dying to know.

1:01:22.428 --> 1:01:25.473
Tell me. What have you guys done to me?

1:01:37.443 --> 1:01:39.445
It was 20 years ago.

1:01:40.029 --> 1:01:43.241
On December 20, 1997,

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:49.038
a family was killed in their home
located in the outskirts of Seoul.

1:01:50.331 --> 1:01:51.874
In this very room.

1:01:56.337 --> 1:01:57.797
<i>You guys are working so hard.</i>

1:02:00.758 --> 1:02:02.385
-What happened?
-Hey.

1:02:03.386 --> 1:02:04.220
Jeez.

1:02:04.971 --> 1:02:08.057
<i>It was a case where a mom and her daughter
were brutally murdered</i>

1:02:08.141 --> 1:02:09.600
<i>with a sharp weapon in the same room.</i>

1:02:10.017 --> 1:02:11.227
Nothing Was Stolen

1:02:11.310 --> 1:02:13.896
FORENSICS

1:02:16.232 --> 1:02:18.192
The Police Don't Seem
Determined to Solve the Case

1:02:18.276 --> 1:02:19.360
The Case Remains a Mystery

1:02:19.444 --> 1:02:21.612
<i>The case generated
nationwide rage and interest,</i>

1:02:22.238 --> 1:02:25.491
<i>and even a special investigation team
was created to tackle it.</i>

1:02:25.575 --> 1:02:27.118
Where Is the Killer?

1:02:27.201 --> 1:02:29.829
<i>However, the police failed
in their attempt to catch the killer.</i>

1:02:29.912 --> 1:02:31.330
SEARCHING FOR ANY WITNESSES

1:02:32.582 --> 1:02:34.584
<i>Year after year passed.</i>

1:02:37.170 --> 1:02:38.880
<i>As time went by like that,</i>

1:02:39.130 --> 1:02:41.758
<i>people gradually started to forget
about the case.</i>

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:46.763
<i>They completely forgot about it
after the statute of limitations expired,</i>

1:02:48.306 --> 1:02:52.018
<i>but the victims' family could not
put it behind them.</i>

1:02:55.313 --> 1:02:58.274
<i>They hired people
to investigate the case again.</i>

1:02:59.108 --> 1:03:00.193
SEONGSHIN-DONG MURDER REPORT

1:03:00.276 --> 1:03:02.653
<i>Month after month passed by.</i>

1:03:02.737 --> 1:03:04.739
<i>The seasons changed too.</i>

1:03:05.823 --> 1:03:08.284
<i>On one spring day
after four years have passed,</i>

1:03:12.914 --> 1:03:14.916
<i>they finally tracked down the killer.</i>

1:03:16.584 --> 1:03:17.418
Why did you do that?

1:03:19.462 --> 1:03:21.464
You didn't even know them.

1:03:22.381 --> 1:03:24.592
I have no recollection of it whatsoever.

1:03:25.259 --> 1:03:26.427
You don't remember at all?

1:03:27.011 --> 1:03:27.887
That's right.

1:03:41.359 --> 1:03:42.193
Kill him.

1:03:49.659 --> 1:03:52.370
<i>So? Are you saying that I'm the killer?</i>

1:03:52.453 --> 1:03:53.287
<i>Yes.</i>

1:03:54.038 --> 1:03:54.872
You are.

1:03:55.248 --> 1:03:56.082
No.

1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:58.543
That's impossible.

1:04:00.628 --> 1:04:04.048
I don't know about other things,
but I know that I never killed anyone.

1:04:04.131 --> 1:04:07.552
You, fucking prick, kept denying it
after we caught you.

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:11.514
<i>We knew for a fact
that you were the killer,</i>

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:15.560
<i>but we thought that you seemed sincere
as we kept on observing you.</i>

1:04:17.061 --> 1:04:18.437
<i>People get gut feelings, you know.</i>

1:04:19.856 --> 1:04:21.607
<i>It didn't look like you were lying.</i>

1:04:22.650 --> 1:04:25.820
<i>The victims' family got extremely confused
when they found out about it.</i>

1:04:26.946 --> 1:04:28.823
<i>The situation was unfolding
in an absurd manner.</i>

1:04:29.615 --> 1:04:33.244
<i>They finally found the man
who ruined their family and their lives.</i>

1:04:33.327 --> 1:04:37.081
<i>They were ready to get their revenge,
but he didn't remember a thing.</i>

1:04:39.041 --> 1:04:40.167
<i>He didn't know why he did it,</i>

1:04:40.418 --> 1:04:42.795
<i>whether he did it alone or not,</i>

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:44.797
<i>or if someone had ordered him
to kill the victims.</i>

1:04:46.424 --> 1:04:49.635
<i>He had no memory of what happened,
so they couldn't go ahead and kill him.</i>

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:54.056
<i>Hence, we recruited another expert.</i>

1:04:54.682 --> 1:04:57.602
<i>He used to work as a forensic hypnosis
investigation expert in the police.</i>

1:04:58.519 --> 1:05:00.062
I'm Seong-dae Park.

1:05:00.771 --> 1:05:03.482
Let's say that this line represents
Jin-seok Song's life so far.

1:05:04.358 --> 1:05:06.277
Let's divide it into his childhood,
teenage years,

1:05:06.736 --> 1:05:09.822
his 20s, 30s, and 40s.

1:05:12.491 --> 1:05:14.035
Why can't you open it?

1:05:14.118 --> 1:05:15.286
I can't open it.

1:05:16.621 --> 1:05:19.874
Around this time, he experienced
the most distressing event in his life,

1:05:19.957 --> 1:05:22.668
<i>and he erased all memories
associated with it from his mind.</i>

1:05:22.835 --> 1:05:24.211
You still need to try.

1:05:24.712 --> 1:05:26.964
<i>In order to bring back
the erased memories,</i>

1:05:27.048 --> 1:05:29.300
<i>we tried all sorts of things
including hypnotherapy,</i>

1:05:29.675 --> 1:05:32.178
but the psychological resistance
is way too strong.

1:05:32.303 --> 1:05:34.055
That's why the method is not working.

1:05:35.473 --> 1:05:36.891
<i>Our hunch was right.</i>

1:05:38.351 --> 1:05:40.019
<i>You actually had no memory
of what happened.</i>

1:05:41.896 --> 1:05:43.648
<i>Dissociative amnesia.</i>

1:05:45.274 --> 1:05:47.234
<i>The memories were so traumatic</i>

1:05:48.486 --> 1:05:52.573
<i>that you blocked them out yourself,
you fucking bastard.</i>

1:05:53.157 --> 1:05:53.991
One thing we can try

1:05:54.367 --> 1:05:57.203
is turning the clock back to right before
he got involved in the incident.

1:05:57.703 --> 1:06:00.539
In other words, before he experienced
the traumatic event.

1:06:01.582 --> 1:06:03.834
You mean, going back to the time
when that prick was happy?

1:06:03.918 --> 1:06:06.837
Exactly. Before May 6, 1997.

1:06:08.005 --> 1:06:11.342
And this is a sleep inducer
called Barbital.

1:06:11.676 --> 1:06:13.010
We should put him on this first.

1:06:13.094 --> 1:06:14.971
Mr. Choi, I'm more than honored

1:06:15.554 --> 1:06:18.724
that you wanted to meet
with this old madam.

1:06:23.729 --> 1:06:25.648
You told me before
that you used to pursue acting.

1:06:25.731 --> 1:06:29.610
<i>You'll be able to understand it easily
if you think of it as of a role play.</i>

1:06:30.945 --> 1:06:32.405
We'll hypnotize him

1:06:33.114 --> 1:06:35.950
and tell him
that he's traveling in a train.

1:06:36.909 --> 1:06:39.787
He'll encounter tunnels
during the train ride.

1:06:40.287 --> 1:06:43.499
We'll tell him
that he'll go back a year in time

1:06:43.582 --> 1:06:46.919
into his past when he was happy
each time he passes through a tunnel.

1:06:48.045 --> 1:06:51.257
So, how will we do this?

1:06:51.340 --> 1:06:55.511
All right.
You're entering the first tunnel now.

1:06:56.387 --> 1:07:00.349
And you just got out of the tunnel.

1:07:00.933 --> 1:07:02.393
What year are you in now?

1:07:06.397 --> 1:07:07.898
What year is it now?

1:07:15.781 --> 1:07:17.199
I'll ask once again.

1:07:17.992 --> 1:07:19.577
What year are you in now?

1:07:33.049 --> 1:07:33.924
It's...

1:07:35.134 --> 1:07:36.260
the...

1:07:37.428 --> 1:07:39.472
year 1997.

1:07:47.271 --> 1:07:49.315
How old are you now?

1:07:50.775 --> 1:07:51.901
I'm 21.

1:07:52.735 --> 1:07:54.070
Good.

1:07:54.779 --> 1:07:56.989
Where are you now?

1:07:58.282 --> 1:07:59.241
In the car.

1:08:00.117 --> 1:08:01.410
<i>Inside a car?</i>

1:08:02.036 --> 1:08:04.121
Whom are you with,
and where are you going?

1:08:06.665 --> 1:08:08.042
<i>I'm with my mom,</i>

1:08:08.751 --> 1:08:09.877
<i>dad,</i>

1:08:11.587 --> 1:08:12.671
<i>and brother.</i>

1:08:13.172 --> 1:08:15.883
<i>We're moving to our new home.</i>

1:08:16.467 --> 1:08:19.553
What are you doing in the car
at the moment?

1:08:19.887 --> 1:08:23.432
<i>I'm sleeping
with my head on my mom's shoulder.</i>

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:26.519
Stay sound asleep like that for now.

1:08:27.061 --> 1:08:31.941
You'll wake up
when I tell you that it's time to wake up.

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:34.485
Okay.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:37.279
<i>And even after you wake up,</i>

1:08:37.363 --> 1:08:40.658
<i>you'll still be a 21-year-old</i>

1:08:41.575 --> 1:08:44.495
<i>living in 1997.</i>

1:08:46.205 --> 1:08:48.624
<i>The people inside the car with you</i>

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:51.210
<i>are your dad,</i>

1:08:52.753 --> 1:08:53.671
<i>your mom,</i>

1:08:54.463 --> 1:08:57.007
<i>and your brother, okay?</i>

1:08:58.968 --> 1:09:00.803
All right.

1:09:01.512 --> 1:09:03.013
You'll wake up

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:05.516
on the count of three.

1:09:06.934 --> 1:09:08.269
One,

1:09:09.979 --> 1:09:10.938
two,

1:09:12.231 --> 1:09:13.065
three.

1:09:17.611 --> 1:09:18.445
My gosh.

1:09:19.446 --> 1:09:20.823
You're covered in sweat.

1:09:20.906 --> 1:09:22.700
Are you okay, Jin-seok?

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:24.994
Mom.

1:09:25.953 --> 1:09:26.787
Yes, Jin-seok.

1:09:28.581 --> 1:09:30.916
<i>I bet he thought the new home
feels familiar for some reason.</i>

1:09:32.293 --> 1:09:35.129
<i>I mean, the killer was standing
in front of the house</i>

1:09:35.212 --> 1:09:37.047
<i>where he committed murder 20 years ago.</i>

1:09:38.465 --> 1:09:41.093
<i>It was only natural
that the house felt familiar to you.</i>

1:09:41.177 --> 1:09:42.052
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1:09:42.136 --> 1:09:44.471
Is the guy who just went downstairs
your older brother?

1:09:44.555 --> 1:09:48.767
-We don't look alike, do we?
-How old is he?

1:09:50.311 --> 1:09:51.645
-Why do you ask?
-Excuse me.

1:09:57.234 --> 1:09:58.277
What was that sound?

1:10:01.655 --> 1:10:02.823
Wasn't it thunder though?

1:10:02.907 --> 1:10:05.075
Gosh, that would've been so stressful.

1:10:05.701 --> 1:10:06.785
Totally.

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:11.081
Fuck, we're screwed.

1:10:19.006 --> 1:10:19.924
All right, I heard you.

1:10:20.007 --> 1:10:22.259
You need to get some fresh air
when that happens. Let's go.

1:10:23.010 --> 1:10:26.138
-What? It's pouring...
<i>-There could've been a few small issues,</i>

1:10:26.222 --> 1:10:28.557
<i>but everything was going
according to our plan, more or less.</i>

1:10:31.936 --> 1:10:34.688
<i>We plan to revive the killer's memories
from that rainy night.</i>

1:10:35.856 --> 1:10:38.275
<i>We reconstructed the murder scene
to the last detail as well.</i>

1:10:41.362 --> 1:10:44.365
<i>Even the music that was playing
at the time of the murder 20 years ago</i>

1:10:44.448 --> 1:10:46.492
<i>was ready to be played again.</i>

1:10:47.826 --> 1:10:50.037
MR. PARK

1:10:53.123 --> 1:10:53.958
Yes, Dad.

1:10:55.584 --> 1:10:56.543
Was it Dad?

1:10:57.503 --> 1:10:58.671
Wait just a few minutes, okay?

1:10:58.754 --> 1:11:01.590
<i>The only thing we had left to do
was making the killer</i>

1:11:01.674 --> 1:11:03.509
<i>enter the exact same situation
as that night,</i>

1:11:06.470 --> 1:11:08.639
<i>but something totally unexpected happened.</i>

1:11:09.765 --> 1:11:10.641
We're the police.

1:11:11.809 --> 1:11:13.686
You're under arrest for assault and fraud.

1:11:13.852 --> 1:11:16.939
<i>Those fucking cops happened to
track me down right at that moment.</i>

1:11:17.106 --> 1:11:18.357
Yu-seok!

1:11:18.607 --> 1:11:19.858
<i>Me getting arrested</i>

1:11:19.942 --> 1:11:22.820
-They took him.
<i>-almost ruined our entire plan,</i>

1:11:22.903 --> 1:11:25.364
-Yu-seok has been abducted.
<i>-but thankfully,</i>

1:11:26.282 --> 1:11:28.492
<i>you totally got the wrong idea
about the situation.</i>

1:11:28.617 --> 1:11:29.994
Jin-seok, what on earth happened...

1:11:33.831 --> 1:11:35.624
-What is going on?
-He got abducted?

1:11:35.708 --> 1:11:36.959
Try calling Mr. Choi right away.

1:11:38.544 --> 1:11:39.503
What is happening?

1:11:41.630 --> 1:11:44.258
<i>Then I finally got released after bribing
and pulling all the strings</i>

1:11:44.341 --> 1:11:45.634
<i>we could pull for 19 days.</i>

1:11:46.302 --> 1:11:49.179
<i>I was going to start reworking the plan
as soon as I got back, but...</i>

1:11:51.223 --> 1:11:53.267
<i>Fuck. It just wouldn't rain.</i>

1:11:53.976 --> 1:11:55.060
TODAY
MOSTLY SUNNY

1:11:55.185 --> 1:11:57.313
<i>We couldn't start anything without rain.</i>

1:11:58.439 --> 1:12:00.316
<i>During the few days
we were waiting for rain,</i>

1:12:00.482 --> 1:12:02.860
<i>-the hypnosis started to wear off,</i>
-One more thing.

1:12:02.943 --> 1:12:05.612
<i>-so you became suspicious.</i>
-That prick followed me here.

1:12:08.741 --> 1:12:11.702
He said that your legs were fine
and that the detectives were fake.

1:12:11.785 --> 1:12:14.038
<i>The suspicion kept growing</i>

1:12:15.831 --> 1:12:17.458
<i>and eventually brought us here.</i>

1:12:25.007 --> 1:12:25.924
Do you understand now?

1:12:27.926 --> 1:12:30.721
Why we did what we did
and why you ended up like this?

1:12:34.683 --> 1:12:35.517
What's the matter?

1:12:37.853 --> 1:12:39.063
Do you think I'm lying or what?

1:12:39.855 --> 1:12:40.689
No.

1:12:42.524 --> 1:12:45.152
I'm sure all of it is true
except for one thing.

1:12:45.694 --> 1:12:46.528
What thing?

1:12:48.364 --> 1:12:49.198
It wasn't me.

1:12:50.991 --> 1:12:52.242
I never killed anyone.

1:12:52.326 --> 1:12:54.078
You piece of trash.

1:12:56.288 --> 1:12:58.082
You killed two people,

1:12:58.540 --> 1:13:00.334
and you'll die soon too.

1:13:00.417 --> 1:13:03.170
In the most painful way there is.
You got that?

1:13:03.921 --> 1:13:04.922
No.

1:13:06.757 --> 1:13:08.967
I won't die.

1:13:14.556 --> 1:13:15.432
Son of a bitch!

1:13:22.564 --> 1:13:24.274
That fucking son of a bitch.

1:13:25.109 --> 1:13:26.485
Turn around.

1:13:28.737 --> 1:13:29.947
I said, turn the car around!

1:13:34.701 --> 1:13:37.204
Where is he? Where did that prick go?

1:13:43.419 --> 1:13:44.670
Faster!

1:13:45.462 --> 1:13:46.338
Go faster.

1:13:56.640 --> 1:13:57.641
There. He's over there.

1:14:02.062 --> 1:14:03.730
Hey!

1:14:08.026 --> 1:14:08.986
Stop right there!

1:14:13.031 --> 1:14:14.158
What the fuck?

1:14:15.659 --> 1:14:17.035
Hey, move your car right now.

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:22.875
Go!

1:14:39.057 --> 1:14:40.267
Hurry up!

1:14:46.356 --> 1:14:47.232
Fuck.

1:14:50.194 --> 1:14:51.069
Shit.

1:14:53.572 --> 1:14:54.406
You piece of...

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:42.431
Sir!

1:16:44.016 --> 1:16:46.268
Are you okay? Gosh...

1:16:51.189 --> 1:16:53.900
This is 911, right?
There has been an accident.

1:16:54.735 --> 1:16:55.819
A car accident.

1:16:57.321 --> 1:17:00.699
Yes, a man just jumped out
into the road out of nowhere. This is...

1:17:08.957 --> 1:17:12.961
-He's breathing now. His BP is 80 over 60.
-Epinephrine 8mcg, dopamine 10mcg!

1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:15.088
Are you all right?

1:17:17.507 --> 1:17:18.717
Do you know where you are now?

1:17:37.694 --> 1:17:40.614
MAY 1997

1:17:53.335 --> 1:17:54.169
Jin-seok!

1:17:55.629 --> 1:17:56.463
Jin-seok!

1:17:59.508 --> 1:18:01.385
-Yes, Yu-seok!
-The car is fixed now!

1:18:02.678 --> 1:18:06.431
Jin-seok! We'll leave now. Hurry back!

1:18:07.683 --> 1:18:09.309
All right, Mom. I'm coming!

1:18:11.228 --> 1:18:14.189
Dad, do you remember
my childhood friend, Jin-san?

1:18:14.272 --> 1:18:16.274
Yes, didn't his parents own
a fried chicken place?

1:18:16.358 --> 1:18:18.527
-That's right.
-Yes, how is he doing?

1:18:18.777 --> 1:18:19.945
He's getting married soon.

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:21.655
-Really? Are you serious?
-Yes.

1:18:25.075 --> 1:18:27.411
Jin-seok, you must be tired.

1:18:27.744 --> 1:18:29.037
You should lean on me.

1:18:30.163 --> 1:18:32.541
He and his girlfriend must have been
together for a long time.

1:18:33.333 --> 1:18:36.002
-She's actually pregnant now.
-Seriously?

1:18:36.086 --> 1:18:36.920
Yes.

1:18:40.048 --> 1:18:41.258
Are you seeing anyone now?

1:18:41.425 --> 1:18:42.259
No, I'm not.

1:18:43.635 --> 1:18:45.095
I should focus on studying, you know.

1:18:54.980 --> 1:18:56.606
SIX MONTHS LATER

1:18:56.690 --> 1:18:58.817
<i>My fellow citizens,</i>

1:18:59.568 --> 1:19:01.695
<i>our economy is</i>

1:19:02.446 --> 1:19:04.781
<i>in a dire situation at the moment.</i>

1:19:04.865 --> 1:19:06.491
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ON THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

1:19:06.575 --> 1:19:09.494
<i>The economic crisis that began
in the countries of Southeast Asia,</i>

1:19:09.578 --> 1:19:15.125
<i>combined with our economy's
structural problems,</i>

1:19:15.667 --> 1:19:17.878
<i>is deepening the urgent sense of crisis.</i>

1:19:18.420 --> 1:19:21.006
<i>Due to the economic development</i>

1:19:21.423 --> 1:19:23.508
<i>we achieved in the last three decades,</i>

1:19:24.301 --> 1:19:27.137
<i>all countries in the world envied
our stable economy...</i>

1:19:35.270 --> 1:19:37.773
FAST CASH LOANS

1:19:40.192 --> 1:19:41.276
No, we can't hire you.

1:19:41.359 --> 1:19:42.986
Sir, please help me just this once.

1:19:43.695 --> 1:19:44.654
Please. I beg you.

1:19:47.324 --> 1:19:48.158
Fuck off.

1:19:48.241 --> 1:19:51.411
I only have a high school diploma.
Yes, I went to a general high school.

1:19:51.495 --> 1:19:53.497
I'm really sorry to ask you this,
but would I be able

1:19:53.705 --> 1:19:57.125
to get paid for a few months up-front?

1:20:06.718 --> 1:20:09.012
I'm a hard-working 21-year-old guy.

1:20:10.722 --> 1:20:13.975
My beloved brother is very ill
at the moment.

1:20:18.188 --> 1:20:22.692
If you trust me and pay me up-front,
I'll be sure to repay your kindness.

1:20:34.079 --> 1:20:35.288
Doctor.

1:20:39.292 --> 1:20:41.962
You lost both of your parents
in that accident,

1:20:42.170 --> 1:20:45.841
and your brother has been bedridden
for over half a year.

1:20:48.134 --> 1:20:51.096
I don't even know
what to say to you as his doctor.

1:20:53.306 --> 1:20:55.308
I'm really sorry
to have to say this to you,

1:20:56.726 --> 1:20:58.520
but we can't let it drag on any longer.

1:20:59.271 --> 1:21:01.982
He must undergo surgery
as soon as possible.

1:21:03.692 --> 1:21:05.277
That's the only way we can save his life.

1:21:08.196 --> 1:21:09.030
Right.

1:21:19.207 --> 1:21:20.584
<i>Come to your senses, will you?</i>

1:21:20.667 --> 1:21:22.752
Do you even know how scary it can be?

1:21:24.254 --> 1:21:27.382
The surgery itself isn't done by doctors
in illegal organ trade.

1:21:28.174 --> 1:21:29.843
Those who sell their organs
don't live long.

1:21:29.926 --> 1:21:31.344
Many die during the surgery as well.

1:21:32.053 --> 1:21:35.223
I understand your situation,
but just give up already.

1:21:35.765 --> 1:21:37.392
I mean, the country is going downhill.

1:21:37.475 --> 1:21:40.645
<i>You should just give up everything
and hang in there at times like this.</i>

1:21:46.234 --> 1:21:47.444
NEW MESSAGE

1:21:51.865 --> 1:21:54.034
BLUE BEARD HAS INVITED YOU
TO A CHAT ROOM. ACCEPT?

1:21:54.117 --> 1:21:55.744
The Moonlight Man entered the chat room.

1:21:56.870 --> 1:21:59.456
Did you really mean what you wrote
on the job seekers' board?

1:22:04.085 --> 1:22:06.838
Yes, I really meant it. I'll do my best,
no matter what the job is.

1:22:06.922 --> 1:22:09.507
Even the part
about willingly giving your soul?

1:22:10.759 --> 1:22:11.885
That part?

1:22:14.137 --> 1:22:15.764
Why are you asking such a question?

1:22:16.473 --> 1:22:18.558
Why are you asking such a question?

1:22:18.642 --> 1:22:20.268
Because you need money,

1:22:20.352 --> 1:22:22.604
and I need your desperation.

1:22:25.523 --> 1:22:28.068
How much do you want?

1:22:32.447 --> 1:22:35.116
Would you be able to tell me
a little bit about the job?

1:22:38.995 --> 1:22:42.123
You'll get paid for killing someone...

1:22:43.708 --> 1:22:46.503
You'll get paid for killing someone...

1:22:49.339 --> 1:22:50.840
You'll get paid for killing someone....

1:22:50.924 --> 1:22:53.802
I'll give you some time to think about it.
You have until noon tomorrow.

1:22:53.885 --> 1:22:56.638
Message me your phone number
if you decide to accept my offer.

1:23:01.309 --> 1:23:04.020
Don't forget. You'll lose the opportunity
after noon tomorrow.

1:23:04.104 --> 1:23:05.146
Blue Beard left the room.

1:23:14.656 --> 1:23:16.157
Tell me now. There is no one else here.

1:23:16.241 --> 1:23:17.784
-Gosh, seriously. I'm also...
-So-yeong!

1:23:25.250 --> 1:23:28.003
DO YOU WANT TO SEND THIS MESSAGE?

1:23:35.301 --> 1:23:37.095
DO YOU WANT TO SEND THIS MESSAGE?

1:23:37.178 --> 1:23:38.179
YES

1:23:54.487 --> 1:23:55.321
Hello?

1:23:56.448 --> 1:23:57.449
<i>Write down</i>

1:23:57.949 --> 1:24:00.660
<i>the address I'm going to give you now.</i>

1:24:03.455 --> 1:24:09.753
<i>It's 425-23 Seongshin-dong
Seongseo-gu, Seoul.</i>

1:24:16.342 --> 1:24:18.261
<i>There will be three people in the house.</i>

1:24:19.471 --> 1:24:21.639
<i>A woman and two kids.</i>

1:24:24.267 --> 1:24:26.061
<i>Do not touch the kids.</i>

1:24:26.895 --> 1:24:28.021
<i>Just get rid of the woman.</i>

1:24:29.773 --> 1:24:30.648
<i>Don't forget.</i>

1:24:31.816 --> 1:24:34.277
<i>Only get rid of the woman.</i>

1:25:24.702 --> 1:25:26.621
Oh. Is it you, honey?

1:25:29.541 --> 1:25:30.375
Honey.

1:25:33.419 --> 1:25:34.254
Honey?

1:25:44.389 --> 1:25:47.058
Don't... Please don't scream.

1:25:47.851 --> 1:25:48.726
I'll just leave.

1:25:50.812 --> 1:25:51.729
Please don't scream.

1:25:58.945 --> 1:26:00.155
I'm sorry.

1:26:00.864 --> 1:26:02.365
I must have lost my mind for a moment.

1:26:03.408 --> 1:26:04.409
-I'm really sorry.
-Mom.

1:26:04.951 --> 1:26:06.035
Is Dad home?

1:26:12.876 --> 1:26:14.502
-No, he's...
-Don't scream.

1:26:15.336 --> 1:26:16.838
I told you not to scream!

1:26:17.964 --> 1:26:18.798
Please don't scream.

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:20.175
No!

1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:21.467
Don't scream, please.

1:26:25.597 --> 1:26:26.431
Wait.

1:26:32.979 --> 1:26:34.689
Please stop screaming.

1:26:35.064 --> 1:26:36.274
I'll leave now.

1:26:38.276 --> 1:26:40.778
Stop screaming, please!

1:27:37.168 --> 1:27:39.921
I... I told you...

1:27:40.838 --> 1:27:43.174
I told you to stop screaming...

1:27:45.510 --> 1:27:46.427
I'm sorry.

1:27:49.681 --> 1:27:51.683
This is why I told you to stop screaming!

1:27:52.225 --> 1:27:55.645
I told you! I told you to stop screaming!

1:27:56.145 --> 1:27:57.188
Chan-mi!

1:27:59.607 --> 1:28:01.234
Stop screaming!

1:29:26.944 --> 1:29:27.862
Mister.

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:40.583
Mister, who are you?

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.712
Where did my mom go?

1:29:59.143 --> 1:30:03.064
If you do as I say,

1:30:04.482 --> 1:30:08.986
I'll bring your mom and sister
home for you.

1:30:09.737 --> 1:30:10.571
Really?

1:30:13.783 --> 1:30:17.078
Go to your room and cover yourself
with a blanket.

1:30:18.412 --> 1:30:19.747
Then count from one to one hundred

1:30:20.998 --> 1:30:22.500
ten times, okay? Ten times.

1:30:23.084 --> 1:30:23.918
You got that, right?

1:30:25.336 --> 1:30:26.170
Yes.

1:30:38.975 --> 1:30:43.271
One, two, three,

1:30:44.147 --> 1:30:48.526
four, five, six...

1:30:59.412 --> 1:31:00.246
Hello?

1:31:00.872 --> 1:31:01.914
<i>Write down</i>

1:31:02.248 --> 1:31:05.084
the address I'm going to give you now.

1:31:06.335 --> 1:31:10.756
It's 425-23 Seongshin-dong
Seongseo-gu, Seoul.

1:31:12.049 --> 1:31:13.885
<i>There will be three people in the house.</i>

1:31:15.136 --> 1:31:17.096
<i>A woman and two kids.</i>

1:31:18.306 --> 1:31:20.224
<i>Do not touch the kids.</i>

1:31:21.058 --> 1:31:22.185
<i>Only get rid of the woman.</i>

1:31:23.102 --> 1:31:26.898
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.

1:31:27.773 --> 1:31:28.774
One,

1:31:29.233 --> 1:31:31.944
<i>two, three,</i>

1:31:32.486 --> 1:31:37.116
<i>four, five, six...</i>

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:47.376
Hello?

1:31:48.377 --> 1:31:49.712
<i>Dad.</i>

1:31:50.087 --> 1:31:52.215
Seong-uk, what's wrong?

1:31:53.257 --> 1:31:56.010
Dad, I listened to that man

1:31:56.969 --> 1:32:00.348
and counted from one to one hundred
ten times,

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:04.393
but both Mom and Chan-mi
are collapsed and bleeding on the floor.

1:32:04.477 --> 1:32:05.937
What happened to Chan-mi?

1:32:06.646 --> 1:32:08.064
She's not breathing.

1:32:08.689 --> 1:32:10.483
Okay, I'll be home shortly.

1:32:25.248 --> 1:32:27.959
Doctor, why did you do such a thing?

1:32:30.336 --> 1:32:31.379
They're your family.

1:32:32.505 --> 1:32:34.131
The sacrifice of my wife

1:32:35.508 --> 1:32:37.760
could've prevented my family
from ending up on the streets.

1:32:40.012 --> 1:32:41.597
With the insurance payout...

1:32:42.932 --> 1:32:45.142
You can't do something like that
to your family, Doctor...

1:32:46.310 --> 1:32:48.562
You accepted my offer
in order to save your brother's life.

1:32:48.646 --> 1:32:50.606
I did it for my kids.

1:32:52.149 --> 1:32:52.984
But...

1:32:53.734 --> 1:32:55.111
But you ruined everything.

1:32:56.946 --> 1:33:00.616
My daughter is dead now.
Your brother will die soon as well.

1:33:03.286 --> 1:33:06.747
So you should die too!

1:33:08.291 --> 1:33:09.166
Wait, Doctor...

1:33:10.876 --> 1:33:12.128
Die.

1:33:16.632 --> 1:33:18.301
Why did it have to be me?

1:33:19.468 --> 1:33:20.386
No reason.

1:33:21.137 --> 1:33:22.555
Just die!

1:33:33.357 --> 1:33:35.359
No. Please, no.

1:33:36.319 --> 1:33:37.737
No!

1:34:37.671 --> 1:34:39.757
People don't die easily, right?

1:34:50.309 --> 1:34:51.602
All of this must be hard for you.

1:34:58.651 --> 1:34:59.902
I'm exhausted, too.

1:35:02.738 --> 1:35:03.739
I'll end your misery.

1:35:20.798 --> 1:35:22.800
Where is the victims' family?

1:35:23.717 --> 1:35:24.552
Why do you ask?

1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:30.349
Please make sure you tell them

1:35:32.435 --> 1:35:35.438
that I'm truly sorry.

1:35:48.284 --> 1:35:49.660
You must have regained your memory.

1:35:58.878 --> 1:35:59.879
Why did you do it?

1:36:01.130 --> 1:36:03.007
Why did you kill
that woman and her daughter?

1:36:08.637 --> 1:36:10.055
Someone put you up to it, right?

1:36:16.187 --> 1:36:17.062
By any chance,

1:36:17.730 --> 1:36:19.690
did the woman's husband hire you to do it?

1:36:24.570 --> 1:36:26.739
I recently received
a piece of information.

1:36:28.699 --> 1:36:31.744
Apparently, he signed up
for a bunch of insurance policies for her

1:36:33.162 --> 1:36:35.414
a month before the incident took place.

1:36:38.751 --> 1:36:39.960
Did he put you up to it?

1:36:41.378 --> 1:36:42.421
For the insurance payout?

1:36:48.177 --> 1:36:52.348
The victims' family wants
to know the truth.

1:36:55.309 --> 1:36:58.229
Remember that boy
you didn't kill that night?

1:36:58.812 --> 1:36:59.647
That little kid.

1:37:02.733 --> 1:37:06.445
You should tell him the truth
and beg for forgiveness.

1:37:08.822 --> 1:37:10.491
You told me
that you would bring my mom home

1:37:10.574 --> 1:37:13.202
if I counted from one to one hundred
ten times.

1:37:17.164 --> 1:37:19.083
Do you know how my life changed
after that day?

1:37:20.167 --> 1:37:22.378
My relatives took all the money

1:37:22.461 --> 1:37:24.004
and abandoned me at an orphanage.

1:37:25.881 --> 1:37:28.884
Fuck. I cried every night and told myself

1:37:30.261 --> 1:37:31.595
that I'll be sure to catch the man

1:37:34.181 --> 1:37:37.184
who killed my entire family when I grow up

1:37:38.852 --> 1:37:41.021
and that I'll get back at him
no matter what.

1:37:42.231 --> 1:37:46.485
Fuck, that night...
Why didn't you kill that kid too?

1:37:49.071 --> 1:37:52.032
You should've just killed that kid too,
you fucking son of a bitch!

1:37:55.494 --> 1:37:56.328
I'm sorry...

1:38:00.082 --> 1:38:00.916
Sorry.

1:38:02.543 --> 1:38:03.377
I'm sorry.

1:38:06.714 --> 1:38:07.548
I'm really sorry.

1:38:09.925 --> 1:38:10.759
I'm sorry...

1:38:12.469 --> 1:38:13.721
Fuck!

1:38:22.271 --> 1:38:23.230
Now, tell me.

1:38:26.734 --> 1:38:28.569
Did her husband make you do it?

1:38:30.487 --> 1:38:31.322
Answer me!

1:38:31.989 --> 1:38:34.199
I'm asking you if my dad made you do it!

1:38:42.791 --> 1:38:43.626
No.

1:38:45.586 --> 1:38:46.754
I did it alone.

1:38:49.715 --> 1:38:50.633
All of it.

1:38:52.551 --> 1:38:53.469
It was all me.

1:39:00.517 --> 1:39:02.436
What the fuck?

1:39:05.773 --> 1:39:07.274
I knew it.

1:39:11.737 --> 1:39:14.365
The fact that her husband signed up
for a bunch of insurance policies

1:39:16.659 --> 1:39:18.327
must have been just a coincidence.

1:39:18.410 --> 1:39:20.204
Right? Fuck. Am I right?

1:39:32.716 --> 1:39:33.550
What the fuck?

1:39:36.470 --> 1:39:39.598
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

1:40:01.036 --> 1:40:02.037
I wish you the best.

1:40:53.630 --> 1:40:54.673
Excuse me, sir.

1:40:55.466 --> 1:40:57.509
That's a dead end.

1:40:57.593 --> 1:40:59.762
You need to come this way
to get to the elevator.

1:42:45.450 --> 1:42:49.079
FORGOTTEN

1:42:51.164 --> 1:42:52.291
<i>Jin-seok!</i>

1:42:52.958 --> 1:42:54.334
<i>The car is fixed now!</i>

1:42:55.043 --> 1:42:58.797
Jin-seok! We'll leave now. Hurry back!

1:42:59.590 --> 1:43:01.341
All right, Mom. I'm coming!

1:43:09.766 --> 1:43:10.642
Hi.

1:43:11.727 --> 1:43:12.728
How old are you?

1:43:14.730 --> 1:43:16.023
You're five?

1:43:20.694 --> 1:43:22.905
It's okay. It's all yours.

1:43:24.489 --> 1:43:26.867
Seong-uk! Seong-uk Choi!

1:43:27.534 --> 1:43:28.785
Mom!

1:43:34.791 --> 1:43:35.626
Let's go.

1:43:36.335 --> 1:43:37.544
What did you talk to him about?

1:43:38.837 --> 1:43:39.671
Did you have fun?

1:43:40.756 --> 1:43:42.049
Shall we go to an amusement park?

1:43:42.174 --> 1:43:44.468
Seong-uk, say yes. Let's go.
Come on! Give me a high five.

1:43:48.972 --> 1:43:50.015
-Did that hurt?
-Let's go.

1:43:50.432 --> 1:43:51.642
What ride do you want to go on?

1:48:34.174 --> 1:48:36.384
