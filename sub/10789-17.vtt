WEBVTT

00:03.125 --> 00:05.708
THAT PLACE WAS
SO NICE, PACE.

00:05.708 --> 00:07.875
THEY HAD INDIVIDUAL
TOWELS IN THE BATHROOM.

00:07.875 --> 00:08.834
REALLY?

00:08.834 --> 00:11.750
LAID OUT IN BASKETS
AND EVERYTHING?
MM-HMM.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.667
WELL, IF THAT'S
NOT THE HALLMARK
OF A CLASSY JOINT,

00:13.667 --> 00:14.667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.332
WELL, YOU DO
DEFINITELY KNOW

00:16.332 --> 00:17.834
HOW TO TREAT A LADY.

00:17.834 --> 00:20.041
WELL, I GOTTA
SPEND MY MONEY
ON SOMETHIN'.

00:21.208 --> 00:23.333
OH, THAT CAME OUT
TOTALLY WRONG.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.208
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT--

00:24.208 --> 00:26.667
N-NOT SOMETHING THAT
I JUST SPEND MONEY ON.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.166
IT'S NOT LIKE
A POSSESSION--
BUT I WOULD.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.000
I WOULD, AND I DO.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.250
WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M WITH YOU?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.375
OK. (CHUCKLES)

00:36.834 --> 00:38.500
HOW'S WORK GOIN', PACE?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.959
UH, IT'S GOING
REALLY WELL,
THANK YOU.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.750
I GOT A PROMOTION,
ACTUALLY.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.500
REALLY? TO WHAT?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.750
I...DON'T KNOW.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.333
THERE'S NO TITLE,
BUT I GET AN OFFICE,

00:48.333 --> 00:50.750
AND, UH,
I GET A SECRETARY.
THAT'S KIND OF COOL.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.083
OOH!
YEAH.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.375
FANCY.

00:54.375 --> 00:57.333
YOU CERTAINLY WON'T
WANT TO TALK TO ME
AFTER TONIGHT, SO...

00:57.333 --> 01:00.542
YOU SEE, I KNEW
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

01:00.542 --> 01:03.000
DON'T KICK A GIRL
WHEN SHE'S DOWN.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.834
YOU KNOW,
I'M STRAPPED FOR CASH,

01:04.834 --> 01:07.375
AND THEY CUT MY HOURS
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S
ON SPRING BREAK,

01:07.375 --> 01:09.083
DRINKING ELSEWHERE.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.667
I GUESS THAT MEANS
YOU'RE FREE FOR DINNER
NEXT SATURDAY.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.041
WELL, ANYTHING
FOR A FREE MEAL.

01:16.041 --> 01:20.000
CLASSY LADY LIKE YOU,
I MIGHT EVEN THROW IN
A FREE DESSERT.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.708
YOU MUST BE SERIOUS
ABOUT ME.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.375
OK, WELL...

01:32.375 --> 01:33.583
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:33.583 --> 01:34.917
I THINK
THAT'S MY CUE.

01:34.917 --> 01:36.250
I'M JUST GONNA...
OK.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.667
CUT MY LOSSES.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.083
UM...

01:41.083 --> 01:42.875
I'LL HAVE MY SECRETARY
CALL YOU ABOUT DINNER.

01:42.875 --> 01:45.375
PACEY, I HAD
A LOVELY TIME.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.291
SO DID I.

01:49.291 --> 01:50.542
GOOD NIGHT.

01:50.542 --> 01:52.083
GOOD NIGHT.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.166
(GROANS)

02:58.166 --> 02:59.458
MORNIN', SUNSHINE.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.000
MMM...

03:02.000 --> 03:03.166
WHERE'S GRAMS?

03:03.166 --> 03:06.291
SHE'S DOWNSTAIRS,
STIRRING PORRIDGE.

03:06.291 --> 03:09.000
MMM. REALLY?

03:09.959 --> 03:11.458
SHALL WE, THEN?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.583
SHALL WE WHAT?

03:16.542 --> 03:19.000
OH. (CHUCKLES)

03:19.000 --> 03:21.291
SHALL WE THAT.

03:21.291 --> 03:22.542
YEAH, THAT.

03:22.542 --> 03:26.041
YEAH. NAH.

03:26.041 --> 03:27.667
NO?

03:27.667 --> 03:29.542
NO.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.250
I'M NOT REALLY
IN THE MOOD.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.959
MOOD? WHO NEEDS MOOD?

03:35.667 --> 03:36.750
WHAT?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.208
NOTHING A LITTLE
TOOTHPASTE WON'T FIX.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.000
OH.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.291
WELL, FINE.
THEN DON'T KISS ME.
SEE IF I CARE.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.959
NOT SO SEXY
WHEN YOU'RE POUTING.

03:51.208 --> 03:54.208
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
OF THESE WERE IN HERE
WHEN I BOUGHT THEM?

03:54.208 --> 03:55.583
12.
MM-HMM.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.041
KNOW HOW MANY
ARE IN HERE NOW?

03:57.041 --> 03:58.500
12.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.208
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN A WEEK, JEN.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.041
THAT'S HARDLY TRUE.

04:05.041 --> 04:08.041
NOT SINCE GRAMS WENT TO BINGO.
THAT WAS A WEEK AGO TODAY.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.000
WHAT AM I,
SEX ON A STICK?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.917
I'M NOT A BOY.
I DON'T HAVE...

04:11.917 --> 04:14.208
THE SAME KIND
OF SEX DRIVE
THAT YOU DO,

04:14.208 --> 04:15.708
ALL RIGHT?

04:15.708 --> 04:17.416
NOT TO MENTION
THE FACT THAT I--

04:17.416 --> 04:18.750
I LIVE
IN MORTAL TERROR

04:18.750 --> 04:19.916
OF MY GRAMS WALKING
IN ON US

04:19.916 --> 04:21.416
IN THE MIDDLE OF
SOME UNGODLY ACT.

04:21.416 --> 04:23.250
SO MAYBE THAT HELPS
YOU TO UNDERSTAND

04:23.250 --> 04:26.375
WHY I'M NOT
JUMPING YOUR BONES
EVERY CHANCE I GET.

04:26.375 --> 04:29.917
HMM. WOW. THEN IT'S TRUE
WHAT THEY SAY.

04:29.917 --> 04:31.041
WHAT?

04:31.041 --> 04:32.041
ONCE YOU START DATING,

04:32.041 --> 04:33.667
THE SEX GOES
RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.417
YOU ARE SUCH
A DRAMA QUEEN.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.083
(LAUGHS)

04:37.083 --> 04:39.750
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
OTHER WAYS FOR US
TO BE INTIMATE.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.834
I'M ALL FOR THAT STUFF.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.542
YEAH? SO AM I.

04:46.542 --> 04:47.834
WELL, COME ON.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.083
HMM.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.458
IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT--SNUGGLING?

04:58.458 --> 05:00.166
MMM. YEAH.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.458
WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS TALKING ABOUT?

05:07.625 --> 05:09.458
NOTHING.

05:20.792 --> 05:21.750
JO.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.250
OHH!

05:23.250 --> 05:24.458
HI!

05:24.458 --> 05:26.291
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS HONOR?

05:26.291 --> 05:28.458
I--I BROUGHT YOU
AN OFFICE-WARMING GIFT.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.667
YOU WON'T GET IN TROUBLE
FOR HAVING VISITORS,
WILL YOU?

05:30.667 --> 05:33.291
NO, NO. NOT IF YOU STOP
DISTRACTING THE BOYS.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.667
YOU WANT TO STEP
INTO MY OFFICE?

05:35.667 --> 05:37.959
HOW PROFESSIONAL.

05:37.959 --> 05:39.667
SO, EVERYONE'S
JUST ON THE PHONE.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.000
IS THIS WHAT
YOU DO ALL DAY?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.834
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

05:42.834 --> 05:44.667
LET ME GRAB THOSE.
THANKS, TOM.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.667
SO, WHAT MAKES YOU
SO BUSY NOW

05:46.667 --> 05:48.333
THAT YOU NEED
AN ASSISTANT?

05:48.333 --> 05:49.708
I DON'T KNOW,

05:49.708 --> 05:52.542
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
SHE KIND OF FREAKS ME OUT.

05:52.542 --> 05:53.542
MARCY?

05:53.542 --> 05:54.959
HI.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.500
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY FRIEND JO.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.792
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.500
F.Y.I. FOR YOU,
MR. WITTER,

05:59.500 --> 06:00.959
THE MEETING'S BEEN
PUSHED TO 3:00,

06:00.959 --> 06:02.375
AND MR. RINALDI'S
IN YOUR OFFICE.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.708
AND WHEN YOU
HAVE A MOMENT,
I'D LIKE A WORD.

06:04.708 --> 06:05.708
A WORD?

06:05.708 --> 06:07.792
DON'T PATRONIZE ME,
MR. WITTER.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.625
I'M SORRY, MA'AM. I--

06:09.625 --> 06:11.834
YOU CAN TALK NOW
IF YOU LIKE.

06:11.834 --> 06:13.792
FINE, MR. WITTER.
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

06:13.792 --> 06:15.166
MR. RINALDI FIRED ME,

06:15.166 --> 06:17.208
AND I'LL BE LEAVING
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.041
(SIGHS)

06:21.708 --> 06:23.834
JUST BREAKIN' IT IN
FOR YOU.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.583
OH, WHO'S THE LOOKER?

06:31.250 --> 06:32.708
YOU DO REALIZE

06:32.708 --> 06:34.250
THAT I'M STANDING
RIGHT HERE?

06:34.250 --> 06:36.875
AND YOU DO REALIZE
THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT,
RIGHT?

06:36.875 --> 06:38.708
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)
RICH,

06:38.708 --> 06:39.708
THIS IS JOEY.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.542
JOEY, YOU
REMEMBER RICH.

06:41.542 --> 06:44.917
AND, RICH,
WHY IS IT, EXACTLY,
YOU FIRED MY SECRETARY?

06:44.917 --> 06:47.667
WELL, UH, SHE TRIED
TO KICK ME OUT
OF YOUR OFFICE.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.166
WELL, DOESN'T THAT
DESERVE A RAISE?

06:49.166 --> 06:52.000
YEAH, WELL,
I DIDN'T LIKE
HER ATTITUDE, WITTER,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.708
OR THE CUT OF HER JIB,
FOR THAT MATTER.
(CHUCKLES)

06:54.708 --> 06:55.917
YOU CAN JUST
FIRE SOMEBODY

06:55.917 --> 06:57.917
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
THE WAY THEY LOOK?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.417
ISN'T THAT
DISCRIMINATION?

06:59.417 --> 07:01.583
IS SHE  HUMAN RESOURCES?

07:01.583 --> 07:03.625
NO. NO, NO.
SHE'S MY, UH...

07:03.625 --> 07:05.083
FRIEND OF MINE.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.125
OH.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.917
SO, UH, WHY AREN'T YOU
IN SCHOOL TODAY?

07:09.917 --> 07:11.083
I'M ON SPRING BREAK.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.208
WHAT DO YOU DO
9 TO 5, JOHNNY?

07:13.208 --> 07:15.375
JOEY.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.875
NOTHING AT THE MOMENT.
UM...

07:17.875 --> 07:21.917
I SAY YOU SPEND
THE NEXT 2 WEEKS
FILLING IN HERE.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.041
YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY
OFFICE, RIGHT?

07:24.041 --> 07:27.250
WHY DON'T YOU
SET THAT UP, WITTER.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.583
HMM.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.083
HE'S KIDDING, RIGHT?

07:31.083 --> 07:34.708
RICH? NO, HE DOESN'T
REALLY HAVE MUCH
OF A SENSE OF HUMOR.

07:34.708 --> 07:37.083
WELL, HOW MUCH
DOES IT PAY?

07:37.083 --> 07:39.959
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT'S, LIKE,
600 BUCKS A WEEK.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.291
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

07:42.291 --> 07:44.625
WOULD YOU ACTUALLY
WANT TO DO IT?

07:44.625 --> 07:45.834
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
ADMIT, PACE,

07:45.834 --> 07:47.625
I MEAN,
IT IS PERFECT TIMING.

07:47.625 --> 07:48.834
I'M BROKE.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.291
WE NEVER SEE
EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.875
YEAH, BUT HANGIN' OUT
BY THE COFFEE MACHINE

07:51.875 --> 07:53.083
IS NOT EXACTLY A DATE,
NOW, IS IT?

07:53.083 --> 07:55.458
WHO'S KIDDING WHO, PACE?

07:55.458 --> 07:59.083
NOW, WE BOTH KNOW
THAT THE BOSS

07:59.083 --> 08:01.959
DOESN'T HANG OUT
BY THE COFFEE MACHINE.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.792
THAT WOULD BE
THE ASSISTANT'S JOB.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.792
AND YOU'RE SURE
YOU'D BE COMFORTABLE

08:05.792 --> 08:08.750
WITH THE WHOLE
BOSS/SECRETARY
POWER RELATIONSHIP?

08:08.750 --> 08:11.625
WE BOTH KNOW
WHO'S BOSS HERE.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.125
(CHUCKLES)

08:15.542 --> 08:17.125
WELL, OK, YEAH.
I MEAN,

08:17.125 --> 08:18.959
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT
COULD HAPPEN, RIGHT?

08:18.959 --> 08:21.625
BARRING ME TAKING OVER
THE COMPANY, NOTHING.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.000
HOW FUN IS THIS GONNA BE!

08:31.041 --> 08:32.707
IT'S ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,

08:32.707 --> 08:34.166
BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING,

08:34.166 --> 08:36.417
IT'S ABOUT WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE TO BE 15...

08:36.417 --> 08:38.291
THAT TIME IN YOUR LIFE
WHEN EVERYTHING'S NEW

08:38.291 --> 08:40.500
AND YOU'RE CONSTANTLY
ON THE EDGE OF A BROKEN HEART.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.625
I MEAN, IT SHOULD BE STYLIZED
AND OPERATIC AND...

08:43.625 --> 08:44.792
AND...

08:44.792 --> 08:47.708
I'D LIKE TO DIRECT IT.

08:47.708 --> 08:49.000
(CHUCKLES)
WHOA, JUNIOR.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.667
LET'S NOT GET
AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.834
WALK BEFORE YOU RUN.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.458
OK.

08:54.458 --> 08:55.667
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:55.667 --> 08:58.166
I LIKE IT.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.041
I DO.

08:59.041 --> 09:01.250
AND I THINK YOUR PASSION
FOR IT IS GREAT.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.166
IT'S JUST...

09:03.166 --> 09:04.875
WHAT?

09:04.875 --> 09:06.166
IT'S A LITTLE SOFT.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.208
AND IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

09:08.208 --> 09:09.708
WE DON'T REALLY DO
SOFT AROUND HERE.

09:09.708 --> 09:11.375
WE DO EXPLOITATION.

09:11.375 --> 09:14.500
LARRY LEARNED
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS
FROM ROGER CORMAN.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.041
YOU COULD PITCH HIM
CITIZEN KANE,

09:16.041 --> 09:18.000
AND UNLESS
THERE'S A MINIMUM
OF 3 NUDE SCENES,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.750
HE'D GIVE YOU A LOOK
LIKE HE JUST
SMELLED A FART.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.750
OK. THAT'S ALL
WELL AND GOOD,

09:20.750 --> 09:22.750
BUT I'M NOT SURE
I KNOW HOW TO
MAKE THAT MOVIE.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.708
MY ADVICE TO YOU...

09:23.708 --> 09:24.834
IS TO PLAY UP THE SEX.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.500
HE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.750
WHAT MAKES THIS PITCH
SO INTERESTING AND UNIQUE

09:28.750 --> 09:30.750
IS THE FACT THAT
IT'S THIS EPIC LOVE STORY

09:30.750 --> 09:31.875
WITHOUT THE SEX.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.166
I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

09:34.166 --> 09:37.166
LARRY NEWMAN IS
THE HORNIEST MAN ALIVE,

09:37.166 --> 09:38.875
A WORLD-CLASS PERVERT.

09:38.875 --> 09:39.917
HE'S ON HIS THIRD WIFE.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.417
SHE'S 23...

09:41.417 --> 09:43.166
AND DONE A LOT OF WORK
IN THE VALLEY,

09:43.166 --> 09:44.417
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.917
WHICH DOESN'T SEEM
TO STOP HIM

09:45.917 --> 09:47.917
FROM COVETING MY RACK,
MIND YOU.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.792
(CHUCKLES)
I'M SO SORRY.

09:49.792 --> 09:52.083
THAT MUST BE TERRIBLE
TO WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENT
LIKE THAT.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.041
PLEASE.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.041
YOU'VE BEEN STARING
AT THE TWINS FOR
THE PAST 20 MINUTES.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.875
I...

09:58.875 --> 10:00.417
NOT THAT I MIND,
OF COURSE.

10:00.417 --> 10:02.959
THEY ARE FANTASTIC

10:02.959 --> 10:04.542
AND WORTH EVERY PENNY.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.041
WHAT'S MY POINT?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.250
I DON'T KNOW.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.917
MY POINT IS...

10:11.917 --> 10:14.041
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
A MOVIE WITH US,

10:14.041 --> 10:16.250
FIND A WAY
TO TELL YOUR STORY

10:16.250 --> 10:19.125
WHILE STILL APPEALING
TO THE LOWEST COMMON
DENOMINATOR.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.750
PITCH LARRY
THE SAME THING
YOU PITCHED ME,

10:20.750 --> 10:24.083
ONLY THROW IN...
A STRIPPER, A 3-WAY,

10:24.083 --> 10:27.083
OR LIKE AN AFFAIR
WITH A TEACHER
OR SOMETHING.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.083
I CAN DO THAT.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.250
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

10:45.291 --> 10:47.291
HELP LINE.
THIS IS JEN SPEAKING.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.458
ARE YOU SURE THAT THAT'S
ACTUALLY A PROBLEM?

10:52.458 --> 10:55.125
BECAUSE
SPEAKING AS A GIRL

10:55.125 --> 10:56.875
WHOSE BOYFRIEND
WANTS TO COPULATE

10:56.875 --> 10:58.625
EVERY WAKING MOMENT
OF THE DAY,

10:58.625 --> 11:00.458
I WOULD ACTUALLY
WELCOME THE BREAK.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.500
I MEAN, I APPRECIATE
THE ENTHUSIASM.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.500
IT'S JUST IT'S--IT'S
A LITTLE EXHAUSTING.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.959
THIS POSITION, THAT POSITION,

11:06.959 --> 11:08.458
"YOU WANT MY LEGS WHERE?"

11:10.166 --> 11:12.375
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN
WEAR A SKIRT ANYMORE

11:12.375 --> 11:16.000
WITHOUT HIM TAKING IT
AS AN INVITATION
TO HIKE IT UP.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.875
HEY, WITTER,
NICELY DONE.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.667
NICELY DONE,
INDEED.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.500
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

11:22.500 --> 11:24.041
THE NEW HIRE.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.375
OH. JOEY.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.375
HEY, JOE.

11:30.291 --> 11:33.583
OH. MORNING, PACE.

11:33.583 --> 11:35.208
MORNING.

11:38.708 --> 11:40.583
EXCUSE ME.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.166
ARE THESE GUYS
BOTHERIN' YOU?

11:44.166 --> 11:46.500
NO. THEY MAY BE TRYING TO,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.166
BUT I CAN'T EXACTLY TELL.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.750
DID ANY OF YOU
GO TO COLLEGE?

11:50.750 --> 11:52.417
WE'RE JUST SHOWIN'
HER THE ROPES, PACEY.

11:52.417 --> 11:54.208
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE,
JOEY?

11:54.208 --> 11:55.834
I MEAN, THIS SEEMS
A LITTLE HIGH.

11:56.708 --> 11:57.708
OH. OH, WHOA.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.041
(CHUCKLES)

11:59.041 --> 12:01.583
THAT'S...SUPER.
THANK YOU.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.875
WELL, GREAT.
I'M GLAD WE GOT
THAT ALL FIXED UP.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.500
BUT SEEING AS THIS
IS MY  SECRETARY,

12:05.500 --> 12:08.417
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO BACK TO YOUR--
AHEM!

12:08.417 --> 12:10.000
OFFICE TEMP--
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
RIGHT NOW.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.208
WHAT'S IMPORTANT--

12:11.208 --> 12:12.542
SHE'S NOT GONNA
BE HERE LONG,

12:12.542 --> 12:13.792
SO DON'T GET
TOO ATTACHED.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.458
BYE-BYE.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.875
NEANDER-CREEPS.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.625
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.125
WHAT IS THIS?

12:32.125 --> 12:35.375
OH. WELL, THAT'S YOUR
OFFICE-WARMING GIFT.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.000
YOU FORGOT TO OPEN IT
YESTERDAY.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.208
I THOUGHT SINCE NOW
YOU'RE A TRUE PROFESSIONAL

12:39.208 --> 12:40.959
AND YOU HAVE AN OFFICE
OF YOUR OWN,

12:40.959 --> 12:43.750
THAT YOU DESERVE
POINTLESS GADGETS
TO STICK ON YOUR DESK.

12:43.750 --> 12:44.959
WELL, THANK YOU,
MISS POTTER.

12:44.959 --> 12:46.291
THAT'S VERY
THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

12:46.291 --> 12:49.041
WELL, I AM THE BEST
ASSISTANT EVER.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.000
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.291
YOU KNOW, UH,
WHEN I GOT HERE
THIS MORNING,

12:54.291 --> 12:55.417
YOU FORGOT
TO MAKE THE COFFEE,

12:55.417 --> 12:58.375
AND I LIKE TO START THE MORNING
WITH A CUP.
OH.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.959
OH, RIGHT. WELL,
YOU WERE A CHEF, RIGHT?

13:00.959 --> 13:03.333
I MEAN, YOU CAN
MAKE IT YOURSELF.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.417
SURE. YEAH.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.250
COULD YOU RUN THIS
DOWN TO TOM, PLEASE?

13:10.250 --> 13:11.375
SURE.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.417
ARE YOU SURE YOU NEED
TO FIND A REPLACEMENT?

13:17.417 --> 13:20.083
SHE'S GOT ANOTHER JOB,
AND SHE'S IN SCHOOL,

13:20.083 --> 13:21.166
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

13:21.166 --> 13:22.792
SHE'S UNAVAILABLE, RICH.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.125
ALL RIGHT. OK.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.625
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE THING'S

13:25.625 --> 13:27.417
BECOMING A BIT
OF A DEBACLE.
I GOT HERE THIS MORNING,

13:27.417 --> 13:29.458
THE GUYS WERE
ALL OVER HER DESK.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.667
LIKE THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
WITH ANYTHING REMOTELY FEMALE.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.083
AND SHE'S ALSO
MY FRIEND.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.291
WHICH MAKES IT
A LITTLE AWKWARD

13:34.291 --> 13:35.834
WHEN I'M TRYIN' TO
TELL HER WHAT TO DO.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.458
YOU GOT TO GET YOURSELF
TOGETHER, MAN.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.250
THERE'S A REPORTER COMING IN
TO TALK TO US LATER,

13:39.250 --> 13:41.458
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
SNOTTING ALL OVER YOUR TIE

13:41.458 --> 13:43.041
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HAD

13:43.041 --> 13:46.417
A NONFAT CAFE MOCHA
LATTE GRANDE WHATEVER.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.834
A REPORTER FOR WHO?

13:48.834 --> 13:51.250
I DON'T KNOW.
SOME CHICK FROM
THE FINANCIAL SECTION

13:51.250 --> 13:53.792
TO DISCUSS OUR LITTLE
UP-AND-COMING COMPANY HERE.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.000
SEE HOW THE BIG BOYS
PLAY AND WHATNOT.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.500
COOL.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.834
YEAH, IT'S SWELL.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.667
SO YOU BETTER STRAIGHTEN UP,
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

14:00.667 --> 14:03.792
THIS BROAD IS INTERESTED
IN YOU IN PARTICULAR--

14:03.792 --> 14:05.750
RISING TO THE TOP
IN RECORD TIME
OR SOMETHING.

14:05.750 --> 14:06.959
REALLY?

14:06.959 --> 14:08.625
SHE WANTS TO TALK
TO ME, HUH?

14:08.625 --> 14:10.708
SERIOUSLY, IT'S
THE FINANCIAL SECTION.

14:10.708 --> 14:11.708
WHO READS THAT?

14:16.250 --> 14:18.208
SO, SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU?

14:20.667 --> 14:22.333
WERE YOU EAVESDROPPING?

14:22.333 --> 14:25.041
WELL, YES.
I'M YOUR ASSISTANT.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.625
IT'S MY JOB.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

14:28.208 --> 14:30.083
MM-HMM.

14:33.375 --> 14:36.417
(BALLS CLICKING)

14:41.708 --> 14:42.667
HEY.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.083
HEY.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.041
DID YOU GET ME ONE?

14:46.041 --> 14:48.083
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WANTED ONE.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.041
WAY TO BE A BOYFRIEND.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.542
YEAH, RIGHT.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.333
GOOD ONE, JEN.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.875
SO, I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT C.J. STANDS FOR,

14:55.875 --> 14:59.083
BUT MAYBE THE "C"
STANDS FOR "CRABBY"?

14:59.083 --> 15:00.625
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:04.041 --> 15:05.500
NOTHING.

15:07.375 --> 15:08.375
NOTHING.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.375
(SIGHS)

15:09.375 --> 15:10.625
THAT'S IT?

15:12.083 --> 15:14.208
I DON'T LIKE YOU
USING OUR PROBLEMS
IN THE BEDROOM

15:14.208 --> 15:16.125
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.583
OH, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

15:17.583 --> 15:20.125
I WASN'T AWARE THAT WE HAD
PROBLEMS IN THE BEDROOM.

15:20.125 --> 15:22.250
AND...SECOND OF ALL,

15:22.250 --> 15:23.291
WHY NOT?

15:23.291 --> 15:26.125
FORGET IT.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.959
WHAT, IS THIS
ABOUT SEX?

15:29.959 --> 15:32.125
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.542
OK.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.375
BUT YOU KNOW,
IF SOME GIRL CALLED UP

15:36.375 --> 15:37.542
AND SAID THAT HER BOYFRIEND

15:37.542 --> 15:39.750
WAS PRESSURING HER
INTO HAVING SEX,

15:39.750 --> 15:41.750
YOU WOULD SLIP ON
YOUR VERY BEST DR. DREW,

15:41.750 --> 15:43.583
AND YOU WOULD TELL HER
NOT TO STAND FOR IT.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.750
LOOK, IF WHAT YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR PAST IS TRUE,

15:45.750 --> 15:47.959
THEN I'M GUESSIN'
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

15:47.959 --> 15:50.583
IS WHY THE CREEPS
AND THE SCUMBAGS WHO
TREATED YOU SO POORLY

15:50.583 --> 15:52.417
GOT THE BENEFIT
OF YOUR SEX DRIVE.

15:52.417 --> 15:55.125
WHEREAS GUYS LIKE ME
WHO ACTUALLY TREAT YOU
FAIRLY WELL...

15:55.125 --> 15:58.125
WE GET RIDICULED
FOR WANTING
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.291
WOW. KUDOS TO YOU, C.J.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.458
THAT IS THE NICEST WAY
THAT ANYBODY'S EVER
CALLED ME A SLUT.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.041
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

16:06.041 --> 16:07.417
BASICALLY,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

16:07.417 --> 16:08.625
IF I CAN BE A SLUT
FOR OTHER GUYS,

16:08.625 --> 16:09.959
WHY CAN'T I BE
A SLUT FOR YOU?

16:09.959 --> 16:11.291
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.583
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE GONNA
KICK ASS IN THERE.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.625
I'M RELATIVELY CERTAIN
I WON'T THROW UP,

16:21.625 --> 16:23.333
BUT BEYOND THAT,
I CAN'T PROMISE
ANYTHING.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.875
(IRKED)
FABULOUS.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.792
DAWSON LEERY!

16:33.792 --> 16:36.708
HA! HOW THE HELL'S
MY FAVORITE YOUNG DIRECTOR?

16:36.708 --> 16:39.291
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, KID.
GOOD TO SEE YA.

16:39.291 --> 16:40.333
YOU, TOO, MR. NEWMAN.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.041
AH, MR. NEWMAN
WAS MY FATHER,

16:43.041 --> 16:45.000
AND THAT BASTARD'S
LONG GONE.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.166
YOU JUST CALL ME LARRY.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.625
HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.

16:47.625 --> 16:48.834
OK.

16:48.834 --> 16:50.959
LARRY.

16:50.959 --> 16:51.834
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

16:51.834 --> 16:53.375
OK.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.166
OHH!

16:55.166 --> 16:56.375
PETER.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.625
YES, LARRY?

16:57.625 --> 16:59.208
MY ASS HURTS.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.667
WHY DOES MY ASS HURT?

17:00.667 --> 17:04.333
I'M SORRY, LARRY.
I, UH, I...FORGOT.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.834
ACTIONS, PETER, ACTIONS.
NOT EXCUSES.

17:06.834 --> 17:09.208
WHEW!

17:09.208 --> 17:10.666
AHH!

17:10.666 --> 17:12.375
IT'S MY PROSTATE.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.333
DAMN THING'S AS BIG
AS A CURED HAM.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.625
GETTIN' OLD, BOY.
WHOO!

17:18.625 --> 17:21.290
IT'S JUST A SERIES
OF INDIGNITIES.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.500
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.165
OK. SO, WHAT ARE
WE DOIN' HERE?

17:26.165 --> 17:28.000
UH, WELL--

17:28.000 --> 17:29.875
OHH! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

17:29.875 --> 17:32.375
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ALMOST FORGOT THIS.

17:32.375 --> 17:34.417
YOU ARE MY HERO, KID.

17:34.417 --> 17:35.458
(CHUCKLES)

17:35.458 --> 17:37.708
THANK YOU...
LARRY.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.917
THAT--I, UH--
THAT MEANS A LOT.

17:39.917 --> 17:41.583
THE RE-SHOOTS WERE
TOUGH, BUT, UH,

17:41.583 --> 17:43.542
ULTIMATELY I WAS
PRETTY HAPPY WITH
HOW THEY TURNED OUT.

17:43.542 --> 17:44.875
I GOTTA SAY,
BY THE END OF IT,

17:44.875 --> 17:47.000
I ACTUALLY FELT LIKE
A REAL DIRECTOR.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.625
RIGHT.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.875
UH, NO, THE RE-SHOOTS
WERE FINE.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.375
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
IS NATASHA.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.708
SHE WAS GREAT,
WASN'T SHE?

17:55.708 --> 17:58.708
I WAS VERY HAPPY
WITH THE PERFORMANCE
THAT I GOT OUT OF HER.

17:58.708 --> 18:01.000
UH, HER PERFORMANCE
WAS MEDIOCRE AT BEST.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.250
WHAT I'M TALKIN'
ABOUT HERE IS THE FACT

18:03.250 --> 18:06.083
THAT YOU MANAGED
TO GET YOURSELF
INTO HER KNICKERS?

18:06.083 --> 18:06.959
(CLICKS TONGUE)

18:09.583 --> 18:11.417
HEATHER TELLS ME
EVERYTHING.

18:11.417 --> 18:13.875
SEE, HERE'S MY THING
WITH DIRECTORS.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.917
I CAN TELL ANY SCHMUCK
WHERE TO PUT THE CAMERA,

18:15.917 --> 18:18.792
HOW TO SAY "ACTION,"
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

18:18.792 --> 18:22.083
BUT WHEN A FREAKIN' P.A.
FIGURES OUT HOW TO BANG
THE LEADIN' LADY,

18:22.083 --> 18:23.083
BUDDY, THAT IS SOMEBODY

18:23.083 --> 18:25.208
I WANT TO BE
IN BUSINESS WITH.

18:25.208 --> 18:29.750
AND THAT'S YOU,
BIG FELLA.
HA HA HA HA!

18:29.750 --> 18:31.041
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

18:31.041 --> 18:33.875
WHOO! YEAH!

18:33.875 --> 18:35.917
OK, DAWSON...

18:35.917 --> 18:38.583
TELL ME A STORY.

18:38.583 --> 18:42.834
OK. SO, WE OPEN
IN A TEENAGER'S BEDROOM,

18:42.834 --> 18:45.375
WALLS PLASTERED
WITH MOVIE POSTERS.
NOW, WAIT.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.792
THIS ISN'T
ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
ABOUT MAKIN' MOVIES, IS IT?

18:48.792 --> 18:50.125
NO. NOT AT ALL.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.125
NOT REALLY.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.458
WELL, EITHER IT IS
OR IT ISN'T.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.125
WELL--
ALL RIGHT.
NEVER MIND.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.125
GO AHEAD.

18:56.125 --> 19:00.125
OK. SO, ON THE BED--
BOY AND A GIRL.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.250
BOTH 15. THEY'VE
BEEN BEST FRIENDS

19:02.250 --> 19:03.792
FOR AS LONG AS
THEY CAN REMEMBER.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.291
ARE THEY, YOU KNOW--
(CLICKS TONGUE)

19:05.291 --> 19:07.041
NO.
HUH?

19:09.166 --> 19:10.458
UH, NOT YET.

19:10.458 --> 19:11.834
I GOT YA.

19:11.834 --> 19:14.417
LET THE AUDIENCE GET
A LITTLE WET FIRST.

19:14.417 --> 19:16.000
I LIKE THIS.
THIS IS GOOD.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.625
YEAH.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.500
SO, UH, THEY'RE
IN THE BEDROOM,

19:19.500 --> 19:21.500
AND THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT MOVIES.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.083
WAIT A MINUTE.
I GOTTA ASK YOU
SOMETHIN' HERE.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.458
UH, IS THIS
A HORROR MOVIE?

19:25.458 --> 19:27.625
NO, NOT AT ALL.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.959
THIS IS A
COMING-OF-AGE STORY.

19:30.458 --> 19:31.834
ACTUALLY, LARRY,

19:31.834 --> 19:34.625
IT'S A TEEN SEX
COMEDY...WITH HEART.

19:34.625 --> 19:38.500
AMERICAN PIE  MEETS
STAND BY ME.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.708
BUT IT'S GOT SEX, RIGHT?

19:47.834 --> 19:49.834
SURE. YEAH.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.708
GOOD. SEE,
THIS IS INTERESTING.

19:51.708 --> 19:54.834
FRIENDS WILL COME
AND FRIENDS WILL GO,

19:54.834 --> 19:56.667
BUT I SAY...

19:56.667 --> 19:58.834
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR A MOVIE

19:58.834 --> 20:01.500
IN WHICH TEENAGE GIRLS
TAKE THEIR CLOTHES OFF.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.583
ALL RIGHT, LET'S CUT
TO THE CHASE, PALLY.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.166
MY ASS IS ON FIRE HERE.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.166
HMM-UNH!

20:07.166 --> 20:08.166
UM, OK.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.625
HERE--HERE'S THE PART
OF THE STORY

20:09.625 --> 20:11.375
THAT I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THE MOST INTERESTING.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.250
OUR MAIN CHARACTER
THINKS OF HIMSELF
AS ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.250
HE'S ALWAYS TRYIN'
TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

20:16.250 --> 20:18.375
AND IT ALWAYS
GETS IN THE WAY
WHEN IT COMES TO GIRLS.

20:18.375 --> 20:21.500
UM, SO IT'S--IT'S
REALLY INTERESTING

20:21.500 --> 20:24.250
TO WATCH HIM GO THROUGH
THIS MORAL DILEMMA

20:24.250 --> 20:26.708
WHEN HE MEETS
THIS GIRL AT SCHOOL
THAT HE REALLY LIKES,

20:26.708 --> 20:28.333
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THAT SHE'S...

20:30.166 --> 20:32.750
A...STRIPPER.

20:37.291 --> 20:38.667
STRIPPER?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.708
YEAH, STUDENT BY DAY,
STRIPPER AT NIGHT.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.959
SEE, I'VE--I'VE SEEN THIS
PROBABLY 100 TIMES,

20:43.959 --> 20:46.208
BUT I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I WOULDN'T STAY UP
TILL 3 A.M.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.250
TO WATCH IT ON SKINEMAX.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.417
AND YOU CAST
ONE OF THOSE

20:50.417 --> 20:53.250
HOT LITTLE
PAST-HER-PRIME STARLETS

20:53.250 --> 20:56.250
WHO'S WILLING TO SHOW OFF
HER NEW BOOB JOB,

20:56.250 --> 20:59.917
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A MINI-BLOCKBUSTER
ON YOUR HANDS.

20:59.917 --> 21:01.083
THIS IS GOOD.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.875
THIS IS REAL GOOD.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.250
I LIKE THIS.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.875
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.583
IT'S THE BEST PITCH
I'VE HEARD IN, UH...

21:09.583 --> 21:10.959
A LONG TIME.

21:10.959 --> 21:12.458
WELL, YOU GUYS WANT
TO HEAR THE REST OF IT?

21:12.458 --> 21:14.083
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST
A VERY SMALL PART OF IT.

21:14.083 --> 21:16.959
LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE ADVICE, PALLY.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.250
WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS YOU
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL,

21:19.250 --> 21:20.542
YOU ZIP IT.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.208
YOU KNOW,
YOU NOD, YOU SMILE,

21:22.208 --> 21:24.583
AND YOU LOOK GRATEFUL.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.458
YOU DO NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.792
ANOTHER WORD
CAN ONLY DO YOU HARM.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.667
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

21:40.291 --> 21:41.458
ABSOLUTELY.

21:41.458 --> 21:44.125
OUTSTANDING! OK.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.125
LISTEN, WE'LL FIGURE OUT
THE BEATS AFTER LUNCH.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.834
IN THE MEANTIME...

21:50.500 --> 21:52.834
TELL ME A LITTLE MORE
ABOUT NATASHA.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.000
(LAUGHS LASCIVIOUSLY)

21:56.000 --> 21:57.959
HUH? BOOM.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.458
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

21:59.458 --> 22:01.333
WHOO!

22:02.917 --> 22:04.458
I HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, WALTER.

22:04.458 --> 22:06.166
I'M JUST NOT WILLING
TO PUSH IT THAT HARD.

22:06.166 --> 22:09.166
LOOK, I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE NUMBERS, OK?

22:11.291 --> 22:14.125
WELL, WHEN?

22:14.125 --> 22:16.458
OK, HOLD ON A SECOND.
LET ME ASK MY SECRETARY.

22:16.458 --> 22:18.000
HEY, JO--

22:18.000 --> 22:20.166
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR THIS, MR. WITTER?

22:20.166 --> 22:22.333
YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT.
WHEN DID THIS COME IN?

22:22.333 --> 22:25.959
UM, WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT TO INUNDATE YOU
WITH INFORMATION.

22:26.959 --> 22:28.041
GOOD THINKING.

22:29.708 --> 22:31.375
(SIGHS)

22:31.375 --> 22:34.834
OK, WALTER, I GOT IT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
SHOOT.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.542
WALTER?

22:36.542 --> 22:39.625
OH, I PRESSED A BUTTON
WHEN I CAME IN HERE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS HOLD.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.959
THAT'S OK.
THAT'S FINE.

22:41.959 --> 22:44.250
WE CAN JUST GET HIM
ON THE LINE AGAIN.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.959
HA HA.

22:46.959 --> 22:48.625
YOU KNOW, JO, YOU'RE
SUCH A SMART GIRL,

22:48.625 --> 22:51.166
I HONESTLY THOUGHT
THIS WAS GONNA BE
A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOU.

22:51.166 --> 22:54.834
WELL, I KIND OF MADE IT A POINT
NOT TO LEARN SECRETARIAL SKILLS.

22:54.834 --> 22:57.667
YOU MIGHT'VE WANTED
TO MENTION THAT EARLIER.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.583
WELL, IF I'M
TOO GOOD AT IT,

22:59.583 --> 23:02.542
THEN NO ONE WILL
EVER LET ME DO WHAT
I REALLY WANT TO DO.

23:02.542 --> 23:06.291
I FIND THAT VERY HARD
TO BELIEVE, MISS POTTER.

23:07.834 --> 23:08.834
HI.

23:08.834 --> 23:10.166
HI.

23:11.708 --> 23:13.041
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

23:13.041 --> 23:15.375
WELL, YOUR SECRETARY
WASN'T AT HER DESK,

23:15.375 --> 23:16.667
SO I HOPE IT'S OK--

23:16.667 --> 23:19.041
THAT'S FINE.
SHE'S, UH, THAT'S--
SHE'S THERE.

23:19.041 --> 23:20.542
OH. OK, WELL, HERE.

23:20.542 --> 23:23.000
YOU WOULDN'T MIND
HANGIN' THIS UP FOR ME,
WOULD YOU?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.792
DO YOU HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT, MISS?

23:24.792 --> 23:26.875
WHY, YES. AS A MATTER
OF FACT, I DO.

23:26.875 --> 23:29.375
UH, THIS IS
SADIA SHAW, PACE,

23:29.375 --> 23:31.166
THE REPORTER
I WAS TELLIN' YOU ABOUT.

23:31.166 --> 23:32.542
OF COURSE.

23:32.542 --> 23:33.708
PLEASED TO MEET YOU
AGAIN.

23:33.708 --> 23:37.000
SO, I GUESS THE RUMORS
I'VE BEEN HEARING
ARE TRUE, PACEY.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.708
YOU'RE CERTAINLY
MOVING UP IN THE WORLD.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.083
SO YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

23:41.083 --> 23:42.917
NOT ENTIRELY,

23:42.917 --> 23:45.333
BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
THE INTERVIEW'S FOR.

23:45.333 --> 23:46.625
I GUESS SO.
(CHUCKLES)

23:46.625 --> 23:49.125
(LAUGHS)

23:49.125 --> 23:50.917
HEY, IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN GET YOU

23:50.917 --> 23:52.417
TO MAKE YOU
MORE COMFORTABLE?

23:52.417 --> 23:54.583
JO, WOULD YOU MIND
GRABBIN' US
A POT OF COFFEE?

23:54.583 --> 23:56.750
SURE, MR. WITTER.

23:56.750 --> 23:57.875
I WILL GET
RIGHT ON THAT.

23:57.875 --> 23:58.875
I WILL JUST WHIP UP
A BATCH.

23:58.875 --> 24:01.166
(SWEETLY)
THANK YOU.

24:03.417 --> 24:05.041
YEAH, THANK YOU.

24:05.041 --> 24:06.208
WHY DON'T YOU STEP IN,

24:06.208 --> 24:08.083
MAKE YOURSELF
MORE COMFORTABLE.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.333
(GROUP PERFORMING GOTH ROCK)

24:34.125 --> 24:35.291
AND CUT!

24:35.291 --> 24:38.959
GENTLEMEN, SATAN HIMSELF
WOULD BE PROUD!

24:38.959 --> 24:41.208
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

24:47.458 --> 24:49.834
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW...(WHISPERING)

24:49.834 --> 24:51.000
YEAH, YEAH.

24:51.834 --> 24:53.166
(GIGGLES)

24:56.750 --> 24:58.750
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

24:58.750 --> 25:00.667
MORAL QUANDARY.
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

25:00.667 --> 25:02.166
BOLLOCKS, LEERY.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.708
YOU'RE LIKE SOME
BLOODY LITTLE ANGEL

25:03.708 --> 25:05.542
THAT POPS HIS HEAD UP
OVER MY SHOULDER

25:05.542 --> 25:07.708
EVERY TIME
I'M ABOUT TO ENGAGE
IN MEANINGLESS SEX

25:07.708 --> 25:08.834
WITH A COMELY EXTRA.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.834
YOU ARE A BLOODY
MORAL QUANDARY.

25:10.834 --> 25:14.708
EXCUSE ME.
I'M IN THE BAND, TODD.

25:14.708 --> 25:16.333
MY APOLOGIES, LOVE.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.417
CAN YOU EVER
FORGIVE ME?

25:19.875 --> 25:21.875
SURE THIS CAN'T WAIT
5 MINUTES?

25:21.875 --> 25:25.208
5 MINUTES?
GEE, WHAT A TREAT.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.125
(TODD LAUGHS)

25:31.333 --> 25:32.667
SO, RICH...

25:32.667 --> 25:35.500
WOULD YOU SAY
THAT PACEY'S ARRIVAL

25:35.500 --> 25:37.500
AND YOUR RISE
IN PROFITABILITY

25:37.500 --> 25:38.625
HAD A DIRECT CORRELATION?

25:40.041 --> 25:42.166
WELL, LET'S NOT GET
CRAZY HERE.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.583
WE ALL KNOW
HOW UNPREDICTABLE
THE MARKET IS.

25:44.583 --> 25:46.625
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
WE ALSO STARTED TO PUSH

25:46.625 --> 25:47.750
A NEW STOCK
AROUND THAT TIME,

25:47.750 --> 25:49.375
AND IT DID
VERY WELL FOR US.

25:49.375 --> 25:51.083
AND THAT WOULD BE
STEPATECH.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.083
YES, AND AS
A MATTER OF FACT,

25:53.083 --> 25:55.083
I WAS THE FIRST
PERSON WHO WENT OUT
WITH STEPATECH.

25:55.083 --> 25:58.000
YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT.
PACEY WAS THE FIRST.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.542
Joey on intercom:
EXCUSE ME, PACE.
UH, JACK'S ON ONE.

26:01.542 --> 26:03.166
THAT'S OK.

26:03.166 --> 26:05.000
YOU CAN HOLD
ALL MY CALLS.
THANKS.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.375
EVEN FROM YOUR ROOMIE?

26:09.041 --> 26:11.291
YES,
EVEN MY ROOMMATE.

26:12.917 --> 26:15.708
Joey: OH, OK. MY BAD.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.083
CARRY ON.

26:19.583 --> 26:22.375
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
IT'S HER FIRST DAY.

26:22.375 --> 26:23.875
I UNDERSTAND.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.959
THIS MUST BE QUITE
A COUP FOR YOU, PACEY,

26:25.959 --> 26:27.417
HAVING AN ASSISTANT.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.458
I HEARD THAT UNTIL RECENTLY
YOU WERE A COOK.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.792
YEAH, ACTUALLY.
I DID DABBLE

26:32.792 --> 26:35.208
FOR A WHILE IN
THE FOOD SERVICE
INDUSTRY,

26:35.208 --> 26:37.000
BUT I'M QUITE--

26:39.250 --> 26:40.917
AHEM. THE BUTTON'S
STICK ON THOSE
SOMETIMES.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.417
I APOLOGIZE.

26:43.417 --> 26:44.583
WHERE WAS I?

26:44.583 --> 26:47.417
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER.
I WAS RIVETED.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.041
FRESH COFFEE?

26:49.041 --> 26:51.583
GREAT. YOU CAN JUST
PUT IT ON THE DESK.

26:51.583 --> 26:52.959
PACEY TAKES TONS OF SUGAR
IN HIS COFFEE.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.417
OTHERWISE,
HE CAN'T DRINK IT.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.750
YOU KNOW, HE PUTS SUGAR
IN HIS FRUITY PEBBLES.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.583
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

26:58.583 --> 27:00.417
AH, HA!

27:00.417 --> 27:02.500
ALL RIGHT. THANKS
FOR YOUR HELP,
MISS POTTER.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.750
THAT'LL BE ALL.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.041
AND HOW DO YOU
TAKE YOURS?

27:05.041 --> 27:06.792
UH, JUST A SPLASH
OF CREAM--

27:06.792 --> 27:08.750
NONFAT, IF YOU
HAVE IT, PLEASE.

27:08.750 --> 27:09.500
THANK YOU.

27:09.500 --> 27:13.792
OF COURSE.

27:13.792 --> 27:15.250
(GASPS)
OH, GOD!

27:15.250 --> 27:17.291
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

27:17.291 --> 27:19.291
OH, MY GOD.
SORRY, SORRY. OHH!

27:19.291 --> 27:21.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN GET IT.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.625
I'M SO SORRY.

27:22.625 --> 27:23.625
I GOT IT.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.625
WITTER, UH,
WHY DON'T WE...

27:25.625 --> 27:27.291
CONTINUE THIS INTERVIEW
IN MY OFFICE?

27:27.291 --> 27:29.458
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
MORE COMFORTABLE THERE.

27:29.458 --> 27:30.417
IT'S MUCH BIGGER.

27:41.959 --> 27:43.625
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

27:43.625 --> 27:46.458
REALLY! AN ACCIDENT.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.917
NOW, WHY DO I FIND THAT
SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

27:48.917 --> 27:50.333
YOU BETTER GET GOIN'.

27:50.333 --> 27:53.166
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS
YOUR 15 MINUTES OF FAME.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.166
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SO
TORN UP ABOUT, MATE.

28:00.166 --> 28:01.667
A JOB IS A JOB.

28:01.667 --> 28:03.208
WORK BEGETS WORK.

28:03.208 --> 28:04.208
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

28:04.208 --> 28:05.458
YEAH. I JUST...

28:05.458 --> 28:07.458
HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME

28:07.458 --> 28:09.625
DOING SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN.

28:09.625 --> 28:12.083
I LEARNED SO MUCH WORKIN'
FOR YOU IN THE RE-SHOOTS
AND EVERYTHING,

28:12.083 --> 28:14.834
BUT I LOST A CHUNK OF
MY SOUL IN THE PROCESS.

28:14.834 --> 28:17.834
YOU'RE SUCH A BLOODY
DRAMA QUEEN, LEERY.

28:17.834 --> 28:20.959
THE TRICK
IS TO KEEP WORKIN'

28:20.959 --> 28:22.208
SO ONE DAY
YOU GET TO A POINT

28:22.208 --> 28:24.166
WHERE YOU CAN WRITE
YOUR OWN TICKET.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.834
BUT WHAT IF BY THE TIME
YOU GET THERE,

28:25.834 --> 28:27.667
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO THE HELL
YOU ARE ANYMORE?

28:27.667 --> 28:29.792
YOU ASK YOURSELF
WHAT KIND OF FILMMAKER
YOU WANT TO BE.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.041
ME, I'M A JOURNEYMAN.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.250
I GO WHERE THE JOBS ARE.

28:33.250 --> 28:36.041
AHH, MAYBE I'M JUST NOT
CUT OUT FOR ANY OF THIS.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.834
OH, I SEE.

28:37.834 --> 28:41.041
SO THIS IS THAT BIT
WHERE I GIVE YOU
A BIT OF A LIFT, IS IT?

28:41.041 --> 28:42.333
NO.

28:42.333 --> 28:43.667
'CAUSE I'M NOT
GONNA DO IT...

28:43.667 --> 28:47.375
EVEN IF YOU ARE
A TALENTED
LITTLE BUGGER,

28:47.375 --> 28:49.250
EVEN IF YOU ARE
LIGHT-YEARS AHEAD

28:49.250 --> 28:51.083
OF WHERE I WAS
AT YOUR AGE.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.875
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

28:54.917 --> 28:56.041
WHAT'S THAT?

28:56.041 --> 28:57.417
GO MAKE A MOVIE.

28:57.417 --> 28:59.667
WITH 10 BUCKS?

28:59.667 --> 29:01.417
IT'S A START.

29:01.417 --> 29:03.166
LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT
WILLING TO DO IT
THEIR WAY,

29:03.166 --> 29:04.375
WITH THEIR MONEY,

29:04.375 --> 29:06.542
THEN DON'T CASH
THE CHECK.
WRITE YOUR OWN.

29:06.542 --> 29:08.750
SOMETIMES, WITH
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY

29:08.750 --> 29:10.375
AND A LOT OF FAITH,

29:10.375 --> 29:13.417
YOU CAN ALMOST
WILL AN ENTIRE MOVIE
INTO EXISTENCE.

29:13.417 --> 29:14.625
THAT'S WHAT I DID.

29:16.417 --> 29:18.041
HOW'D IT TURN OUT?

29:18.041 --> 29:19.125
IT WAS RUBBISH...

29:19.125 --> 29:21.792
BUT IT GOT ME HERE.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.959
HERE I AM, DOING
THE DEVIL'S WORK

29:23.959 --> 29:25.458
IN SUNNY LOS ANGELES.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.250
LISTEN, MATE,

29:28.250 --> 29:30.208
I KNOW NO MATTER
WHAT YOU DO...

29:30.208 --> 29:31.750
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT
WITH HEART

29:31.750 --> 29:34.208
AND BALLS
AND SWAGGER.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.750
AND THAT IS ALL
THAT MATTERS
IN THIS WORLD.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.166
REMEMBER THAT.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.250
GO ON, GET OUTTA HERE.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.625
GO CHANGE A DIAPER
OR SOMETHIN'.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.959
WELL, WHAT WAS THAT EARLIER?

30:06.959 --> 30:08.792
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT WOMAN?

30:08.792 --> 30:10.166
THE REPORTER?

30:10.166 --> 30:13.125
I'VE MET HER ONCE...
AT A FUNCTION.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.625
MONTHS AGO.

30:14.625 --> 30:15.834
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME.

30:15.834 --> 30:17.792
WHY DOES THAT
NOT SHOCK ME?

30:17.792 --> 30:19.333
WE WERE NEVER
FORMALLY INTRODUCED.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.166
I MEAN, WOULD IT
HAVE KILLED YOU

30:21.166 --> 30:22.792
TO HAVE ACTED
PROFESSIONALLY TODAY?

30:22.792 --> 30:25.333
COME ON, PACEY.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.458
YOU GUYS ARE PIGS.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.333
I MEAN, ACCORDING TO
CAVEMAN STANDARDS,

30:29.333 --> 30:30.959
I'M NOT THE
PROFESSIONAL TYPE.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.166
AND WHAT TYPE IS THAT?

30:32.166 --> 30:33.458
THE TYPE THAT CAN
POUR A CUP OF COFFEE

30:33.458 --> 30:35.125
WITHOUT PAINTING IT
ALL OVER THE WALLS?

30:35.125 --> 30:36.500
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT  THAT TYPE.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.667
THAT'S ALL AN ASSISTANT
IS TO YOU, ISN'T IT?

30:38.667 --> 30:41.041
JUST SOME CHICK
WHO POURS COFFEE.

30:41.041 --> 30:43.834
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOU WANTED TO BE
A CAREER ASSISTANT.

30:43.834 --> 30:46.000
WHY DO YOU THINK
RICH FIRED MARCY?

30:46.000 --> 30:49.125
'CAUSE SHE'S OVER 30.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.291
HAVE YOU EVER
EVEN NOTICED
THE ASSISTANTS HERE?

30:53.291 --> 30:55.834
I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S NO GOOD WAY
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

30:55.834 --> 30:58.166
THEY LOOK LIKE
THE MAXIM  GIRLS OF
THE OFFICE OUT THERE.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.834
I GUESS
I'D NEVER NOTICED.

31:00.834 --> 31:03.333
BECAUSE WHEN I COME HERE,
IT'S TO DO MY JOB.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.792
WHICH I WAS ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD AT

31:04.792 --> 31:06.792
UNTIL YOU CAME HERE
AND SABOTAGED ME.

31:06.792 --> 31:09.333
GET REAL, PACEY.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.625
ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS A LITTLE RESPECT,

31:11.625 --> 31:12.792
A LITTLE HUMAN KINDNESS.

31:12.792 --> 31:14.291
BUT YOU SEE,
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.834
I DON'T HAVE TO RESPECT YOU
OR BE KIND TO YOU.

31:15.834 --> 31:16.834
YOU'RE MY SECRETARY.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.834
OH, THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT?

31:18.834 --> 31:19.875
YOU REGRESSED--
WOMAN!

31:19.875 --> 31:21.875
YOU ARE WRECKING MY HEAD.

31:21.875 --> 31:24.500
COULD YOU NOT JUST
ACCEPT THE TEMPORARY
AND COME WITH A SMILE

31:24.500 --> 31:27.041
AND MAYBE A LITTLE GRACE?

31:27.041 --> 31:31.208
NO. NOT IF THIS IS HOW
YOU PLAN ON TREATING
YOUR FUTURE ASSISTANTS.

31:31.208 --> 31:32.500
FRANKLY, PACEY,

31:32.500 --> 31:35.208
I'M BEGINNING TO
UNDERSTAND THE NICKNAME.

31:36.667 --> 31:38.583
WHAT NICKNAME?

31:39.875 --> 31:42.708
THEY CALL YOU WITLESS.

31:42.708 --> 31:44.875
WHO CALLS ME WITLESS?

31:44.875 --> 31:46.667
I THINK THAT WOULD BE
UNPROFESSIONAL OF ME

31:46.667 --> 31:48.375
TO DISCLOSE
SUCH INFORMATION.

31:48.375 --> 31:49.417
WHERE WAS
THAT PROFESSIONALISM

31:49.417 --> 31:51.458
WHEN YOU WERE POURING CREAM
DOWN THE REPORTER'S LEG?

31:51.458 --> 31:52.542
OH, PLEASE.

31:52.542 --> 31:54.500
DON'T SAY "REPORTER"

31:54.500 --> 31:57.583
LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BURNED
THAT GIRL'S NAME
INTO YOUR MEMORY.

31:57.583 --> 32:01.208
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS THE PROPER ARENA
TO VENT YOUR JEALOUSY.

32:01.208 --> 32:03.083
JEALOUS?!

32:03.083 --> 32:04.542
HARDLY. OK, YEAH.

32:04.542 --> 32:07.083
I MIGHT'VE HAD
SOME SORT OF
PSYCHOTIC LAPSE,

32:07.083 --> 32:08.542
BUT THAT WAS ODD,
REALLY, BECAUSE...

32:08.542 --> 32:09.583
WHY WOULD I
BE JEALOUS?

32:09.583 --> 32:10.417
I DON'T KNOW.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.250
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'D
EVER BE ATTRACTED

32:12.250 --> 32:13.875
TO THE SHREWD
BUSINESS TYPE, RIGHT?

32:13.875 --> 32:15.083
WELL, WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

32:15.083 --> 32:17.542
'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT JEALOUS. RIGHT?

32:19.542 --> 32:23.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D LIKE TO
ISSUE AN APOLOGY.

32:23.291 --> 32:24.583
TAKE A LETTER, WOULD YOU?

32:26.083 --> 32:28.583
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A PEN AND PAPER.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.625
DEAR...MISS...SHAW...

32:39.917 --> 32:42.500
IT WAS...WONDERFUL...

32:42.500 --> 32:44.250
TO SEE YOU
THIS AFTERNOON.

32:44.250 --> 32:45.959
NO, NO. GO BACK.

32:45.959 --> 32:48.333
IT WAS LOVELY
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.750
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

32:50.750 --> 32:54.333
TO APOLOGIZE FOR
MY SECRETARY'S BEHAVIOR.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.083
BECAUSE, YOU SEE,
SHE'S NEW...

32:57.083 --> 32:58.834
AND VERY BAD.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.166
I MISSED THE LAST PART.

33:04.166 --> 33:06.708
IT WAS SOMETHING MORONIC
FOLLOWED BY SOMETHING INANE.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.333
I'M, UH,
HEADED OUT, WITTER.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.959
JEEZ, MAN.

33:37.959 --> 33:40.667
AT LEAST I WAITED A WEEK
WITH MINE.

33:44.166 --> 33:45.792
PIGS.

33:45.792 --> 33:47.083
WE'RE ALL PIGS.

33:49.000 --> 33:49.875
MM-HMM.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.000
WHATEVER IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.875
C.J. THINKS
I'M A SLUT.

34:12.875 --> 34:13.833
I DO NOT.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.333
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
SUCH A THING, JENNIFER?

34:16.333 --> 34:17.875
BECAUSE HE
PRETTY MUCH SAID SO.

34:17.875 --> 34:18.958
NO, I DIDN'T.

34:18.958 --> 34:22.208
WELL, C.J.,
WHY DO YOU THINK
JENNIFER FEELS THIS WAY?

34:22.208 --> 34:24.917
WELL, SHE SEEMED
TO LIKE HAVING SEX

34:24.917 --> 34:27.250
RIGHT UP UNTIL
THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
HAVING SEX WITH ME.

34:27.250 --> 34:29.208
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.875
I SEE THE PROBLEM HERE.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.417
YOU DO?
MMM.

34:32.417 --> 34:36.083
C.J., JENNIFER
IS ATTEMPTING

34:36.083 --> 34:39.333
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
IN HER YOUNG LIFE

34:39.333 --> 34:42.417
TO HAVE A FULL, WELL-ROUNDED
RELATIONSHIP WITH A BOY.

34:42.417 --> 34:44.500
AND, JENNIFER,

34:44.500 --> 34:48.250
C.J.'s PROBLEM
IS THAT HE, LIKE

34:48.250 --> 34:50.458
ANY YOUNG MAN
OF PURE HEART
AND GOOD INTENTION,

34:50.458 --> 34:51.750
IS WORRIED

34:51.750 --> 34:54.458
THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE MORE ATTRACTED

34:54.458 --> 34:56.417
TO THE RAKES
OF THIS WORLD.

34:56.417 --> 34:58.083
WELL, YOU CAN TELL C.J.

34:58.083 --> 35:00.750
THAT NICE PECS
AND A GOOD 6-PACK
ONLY GO SO FAR.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.250
AND YOU CAN TELL JENNIFER
THAT WHAT SHE JUST SAID

35:04.250 --> 35:06.583
DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL
THE SLIGHTEST BIT BETTER.

35:06.583 --> 35:09.250
(MUMBLING)
I HAVE NICE PECS.

35:10.333 --> 35:11.917
JENNIFER?

35:11.917 --> 35:13.583
YOU CAN TELL C.J.

35:13.583 --> 35:15.542
THAT THE BEST SEX
THAT I'VE EVER HAD
IN MY LIFE

35:15.542 --> 35:16.667
HAS BEEN WITH HIM.

35:20.917 --> 35:22.000
THAT'LL DO.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.792
YOU CAN TELL JEN THAT...

35:29.792 --> 35:32.417
I'M SORRY IF
I MADE HER FEEL BAD...

35:32.417 --> 35:35.792
AND...THAT I WAS
NEVER INSINUATING

35:35.792 --> 35:38.500
THAT SHE'D BE
OF QUESTIONABLE MORALITY.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.250
AND THAT I WILL
SNUGGLE WITH HER

35:41.250 --> 35:42.917
ANYTIME SHE WANTS.

35:47.417 --> 35:50.750
WELL. I THINK
MY WORK IS DONE HERE.

35:50.750 --> 35:53.625
I HAVE PEACE TO BROKER
ELSEWHERE IN BEANTOWN.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.375
I'M SO SORRY.

35:59.375 --> 36:02.583
NO. NO. I'M SORRY.

36:02.583 --> 36:04.583
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
ABOUT WANTIN'
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

36:04.583 --> 36:05.750
I MEAN, THAT'S
JUST HOW IT IS.

36:05.750 --> 36:06.834
THAT'S HOW
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.792
YOU PROMISE?

36:08.792 --> 36:11.250
OH, I PROMISE.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.000
OOH. (CHUCKLES)

36:14.000 --> 36:16.041
I THINK
I'M IN THE MOOD.
(CHUCKLES)

36:17.291 --> 36:18.959
IN THE MOOD FOR WHAT?

36:19.875 --> 36:22.000
(SIGHS) NO,
IT JUST PASSED.
NO.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.583
N--I--UH...
I'M JUST KIDDIN'.

36:26.166 --> 36:27.542
SHALL WE, THEN?

36:37.667 --> 36:40.375
WELL, I THINK WE'RE
IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE HERE.

36:40.375 --> 36:42.834
JUST MAKE SURE...

36:42.834 --> 36:43.750
THAT THE FIRE

36:43.750 --> 36:45.792
AT THE STRIP CLUB
IS SPECTACULAR.
I MEAN--

36:45.792 --> 36:47.500
WHOOSH! ALL RIGHT?

36:47.500 --> 36:49.959
NOW, HAVE YOU, UH...
THOUGHT ABOUT A TITLE,
DAWSON?

36:51.375 --> 36:52.542
A TI--UH, NO.

36:52.542 --> 36:54.000
I HAVEN'T,
ACTUALLY.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.041
I GOT ONE
FOR YOU.

36:55.041 --> 36:57.250
SUNSET STRIPPED.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.834
SUNSET STRIPPED.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.250
I...UM...

37:03.250 --> 37:05.208
THINK
IT'S VERY CLEVER.

37:05.208 --> 37:07.417
ECONOMICAL...

37:07.417 --> 37:08.875
YEAH, WORKS WELL.

37:08.875 --> 37:11.041
UH, YOU KNOW, BEIN'
THAT HER--HER NAME
IS SUNSET.

37:11.041 --> 37:13.208
AND I THINK IT'LL HELP
WITH THE FOREIGN, TOO.

37:13.208 --> 37:15.041
WHICH REMINDS ME--

37:15.041 --> 37:17.875
A MINIMUM OF 3
NUDE SCENES, PLEASE?

37:17.875 --> 37:20.583
THAT'S NOT
INCLUDING THE SCENES
IN THE STRIP BAR.

37:20.583 --> 37:23.208
I WANT THIS PICTURE
TO BE WALL-TO-WALL
BOOBS.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.500
OK?

37:25.500 --> 37:27.542
THIS IS GONNA BE
A VERY GOOD PICTURE.

37:27.542 --> 37:29.834
MY FRIENDS, THANK YOU.
THAT'S IT. CONGRATS

37:29.834 --> 37:30.959
ON A GREAT MEETING.

37:34.250 --> 37:35.625
ATTAGIRL.

37:35.625 --> 37:38.000
VERY GOOD.
GOOD WORK.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.917
LET'S GO.
NICE GOIN', EVERYBODY.

37:41.917 --> 37:44.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UM, EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY.

37:46.917 --> 37:49.041
WELL, WHAT IS IT?
OUT WITH IT.

37:49.041 --> 37:50.750
I CAME IN HERE
THE OTHER DAY

37:50.750 --> 37:52.750
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO TELL A STORY

37:52.750 --> 37:54.875
ABOUT...
SOMETHING SMALL,
SOMETHING PERSONAL,

37:54.875 --> 37:58.250
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN...
TRYIN' TO FIGURE OUT
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

37:58.250 --> 38:00.917
I WANTED TO WRITE
ABOUT GROWING UP...

38:00.917 --> 38:03.125
AND WHY IT'S
SO HARD. AND...

38:03.125 --> 38:04.959
I WANTED
TO WRITE ABOUT
FALLING IN LOVE

38:04.959 --> 38:08.417
AND WHY IT CAN'T LAST,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
HOW IT LASTS FOREVER.

38:10.083 --> 38:12.291
AND SOMEHOW,
THAT GOT TWISTED
INTO A STORY

38:12.291 --> 38:13.250
ABOUT A STRIPPER.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.333
I--I GUESS
WHAT I'M TRYIN'
TO SAY IS,

38:16.333 --> 38:17.959
I CAN'T DO THIS.

38:17.959 --> 38:19.959
I APPRECIATE
THE--THE OFFER

38:19.959 --> 38:22.458
AND THE CONFIDENCE...
BUT...

38:22.458 --> 38:24.792
I JUST
WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT
TAKING YOUR MONEY.

38:24.792 --> 38:27.333
ARE YOU
ABSOLUTELY SURE
ABOUT THIS?

38:27.333 --> 38:28.875
(SIGHS)

38:30.625 --> 38:34.041
YEAH. YEAH, I AM.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.291
ALL RIGHT, PUT TOGETHER
A DIRECTORS LIST.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.083
I WANT TO GET
SOMEBODY ON THIS
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

38:40.417 --> 38:43.125
NICE KNOWIN' YOU, KID.
THE BEST OF LUCK
TO YOU, HUH?

38:43.125 --> 38:44.250
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:47.500 --> 38:48.792
ALL RIGHT.

38:48.792 --> 38:51.458
HERE. GOT SOMEBODY
HERE IN MIND.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.083
THIS IS SOMEBODY
WE COULD CALL.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.291
HEY, MR. WITTER.
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

39:03.291 --> 39:06.166
OH, NOTHING, ACTUALLY.
I'M KINDA PARTIAL
TO THIS JACKET.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.750
NOT THE BEST
OF FIRST DAYS,
I'LL ADMIT.

39:08.750 --> 39:09.708
NO.

39:09.708 --> 39:11.000
BUT I'M
OF THE OPINION

39:11.000 --> 39:12.458
THAT SOME WORLDS
SHOULD NEVER
COLLIDE.

39:12.458 --> 39:14.291
PLUS, HOW ARE YOU
EVER GONNA TAKE ME
SERIOUSLY--

39:14.291 --> 39:15.333
I GOT IT--
NOW THAT YOU KNOW

39:15.333 --> 39:16.333
THE GUYS
CALL ME WITLESS?

39:16.333 --> 39:18.125
YEAH, AND
MY WHOLE JEALOUSY ACT

39:18.125 --> 39:20.500
REALLY DIDN'T SHOWCASE
MY BEST FEATURES.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.667
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I KINDA LIKED THAT PART.

39:22.667 --> 39:25.667
YOU WERE JUST HOPING
SHE AND I WOULD WRESTLE.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.041
WHAT KIND OF MAN
DO YOU TAKE
ME FOR?

39:28.041 --> 39:31.166
I GUESS I'M
JUST NOT USED
TO OFFICE COMBAT.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.500
I'M MORE
OF A DRUNK
WRANGLER.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.834
THAT'S GOOD NEWS,
ACTUALLY, BECAUSE
I WANTED TO TELL YOU,

39:35.834 --> 39:36.959
DON'T QUIT
YOUR NIGHT JOB.

39:36.959 --> 39:39.375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:39.375 --> 39:41.375
WELL, I MEAN
THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

39:41.375 --> 39:43.208
DO I EVER WANT TO SEE YOU
IN MY PLACE OF WORK AGAIN,

39:43.208 --> 39:45.125
REGARDLESS OF HOW HOT
YOU LOOK IN PINSTRIPES.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.542
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

39:49.542 --> 39:52.875
Y-YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,
C-CAN YOU THINK OF
ANY BETTER SOLUTION?

39:52.875 --> 39:54.834
IS THIS BECAUSE
OF THE WHOLE COFFEE
THING, PACEY?

39:54.834 --> 39:56.917
BECAUSE I CAN
MAKE COFFEE.

39:56.917 --> 39:58.333
AND I CAN SERVE IT
AND EVERYTHING.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.083
I'M NOTHING IF NOT
A PROFESSIONAL
SERVER.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.875
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE COFFEE THING.

40:01.875 --> 40:03.208
OK?

40:03.208 --> 40:05.000
THEN WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

40:05.000 --> 40:08.667
JO, HOW CAN YOU
EXPECT ME TO CONCENTRATE
IF YOU'RE AROUND ALL DAY?

40:08.667 --> 40:11.667
AM I REALLY THAT MUCH
OF A DISTRACTION, PACEY?

40:11.667 --> 40:15.250
I MEAN, MY DESK IS
OUTSIDE OF YOUR OFFICE.
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE ME.

40:15.250 --> 40:18.208
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.
AND I WOULD NOT HAVE COME
AS FAR AS I HAVE

40:18.208 --> 40:20.250
IF YOU WERE
5 FEET AWAY FROM ME
ALL THE TIME.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.083
I JUST WOULDN'T.
TRUST ME.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.083
REALLY?

40:24.083 --> 40:25.583
AND WHY IS THAT?

40:28.542 --> 40:30.083
OK, NOW YOU'RE
JUST MILKIN' THIS

40:30.083 --> 40:31.959
FOR ALL IT'S WORTH,
AREN'T YOU?

40:33.125 --> 40:35.000
FINE. (SIGHS)

40:35.000 --> 40:36.708
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO CONCENTRATE

40:36.708 --> 40:38.750
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
YOU'RE 5 FEET AWAY FROM ME

40:38.750 --> 40:42.083
OR 25 FEET
AWAY FROM ME,
FOR THAT MATTER...

40:42.083 --> 40:44.917
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE THING
THAT I WANT TO DO.

40:44.917 --> 40:47.291
DO TELL.

41:09.792 --> 41:12.208
I'M SORRY, MR. WITTER.
I DON'T THINK I CAN
WORK FOR YOU ANYMORE.

41:17.125 --> 41:19.291
FINE. JUST REMEMBER
THAT I FIRED YOU.

41:19.291 --> 41:20.917
NO, NO. I QUIT.

41:21.917 --> 41:23.959
YOU HAVE TO LET ME
KEEP MY DIGNITY.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.125
OK, BUT
IF I FIRE YOU,

41:26.125 --> 41:28.291
THEN YOU GET
SEVERANCE PAY.

41:28.291 --> 41:30.125
OH.

41:30.125 --> 41:33.750
WELL, JUST REMEMBER,
YOU'LL NEVER FIND
ANOTHER GIRL LIKE ME.

41:33.750 --> 41:36.959
I PREFER TO THINK
OF MY SECRETARIES
AS WOMEN, BUT OK.

41:36.959 --> 41:38.959
WELL, ENOUGH OF THAT.
I THINK WE CAN
BOTH AGREE

41:38.959 --> 41:40.500
THAT THIS WASN'T
THE BEST IDEA.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.125
NO DOUBT.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.166
MY CURRENT THINKING
IS THAT RELATIONSHIPS

41:44.166 --> 41:46.959
MAKE TERRIBLE PLATFORMS
FOR MULTI-TASKING.

41:46.959 --> 41:49.125
PITY, THAT.
I WAS  LOOKING FORWARD

41:49.125 --> 41:51.125
TO SEEING YOU
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

41:52.667 --> 41:55.291
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE
A POINT TO MAKE MORE TIME,
THEN, WON'T WE?

41:56.667 --> 41:57.875
(CHUCKLES)

41:57.875 --> 41:59.208
YOU ALMOST DONE
HERE?

42:00.875 --> 42:03.375
I JUST HAVE TO
CLOSE UP THE REGISTER.

42:03.375 --> 42:06.375
WELL...THAT'S EXCELLENT,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING...

42:06.375 --> 42:08.708
I JUST HAPPEN TO LIVE
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

42:08.708 --> 42:10.959
I WAS THINKING
THAT, TOO.

42:10.959 --> 42:12.458
REALLY.
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

42:12.458 --> 42:13.792
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

42:13.792 --> 42:15.083
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

42:17.792 --> 42:19.500
HEY. YOU DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY CHANCE

42:19.500 --> 42:21.458
YOU MIGHT BE WILLING
TO WEAR THAT SECRETARY'S
OUTFIT--

42:21.458 --> 42:23.500
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.917
WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THAT LATER.
EXCUSE ME.

42:35.417 --> 42:37.125
HEY.

42:41.500 --> 42:42.708
EDDIE.
