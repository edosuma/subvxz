WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:03.536
KELLY:
<i>Yeah, well, we'll see you then.</i>

00:06.072 --> 00:08.208
I had to elbow
a home ec teacher

00:08.274 --> 00:10.110
to get the last Italian wool
in Southern California.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.579
Okay, we have six days
to finish all the suits.

00:12.645 --> 00:14.381
Did you pick up
the reopening banner?

00:14.447 --> 00:16.349
Oh, that's not a happy face.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.118
No, it isn't.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.353
The buyers from New York
just called.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.123
(gasps) No, no, no, no, no,
they can't cancel.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.524
No, they're so excited
to see your men's line

00:24.591 --> 00:26.159
that they've moved
their trip up.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.360
They'll be here in two days.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.529
We reopen in three days.

00:29.596 --> 00:32.365
That's what the banner says.

00:32.432 --> 00:35.034
I wanted your first week back
to be easy,

00:35.101 --> 00:36.803
and it's turning
into a total disaster.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.405
It's not your fault.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.507
Does this stuff happen
to Vera Wang?

00:40.573 --> 00:44.244
If it does, she hires help,
and so will we.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.211
Well, we can't afford that.

00:45.278 --> 00:46.379
That's my point, Donna.

00:46.446 --> 00:49.115
The store hasn't made a dime
in weeks.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.551
That's why this event
has to be huge.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.520
I know to make money,
you have to spend money,

00:53.586 --> 00:56.556
but somehow the concepts "huge"
and "two days,"

00:56.623 --> 00:58.258
they just don't go together
nicely.

00:58.324 --> 01:01.394
Okay, you finish the suits.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.363
I will figure this out.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.132
(sighs) Oh, boy.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.436
STEVE: I was watching this show
last night on penguins.

01:09.502 --> 01:12.338
Do you know the male penguin
actually takes care of the egg?

01:12.405 --> 01:13.573
DYLAN:
Didn't know it.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.409
Balances it on his webbed feet
so it never touches the ice.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.410
Where's the admissions office?

01:17.477 --> 01:18.344
It's this way.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.679
Listen, thanks for the ride.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.581
The shop should have my bike
back tomorrow.

01:21.648 --> 01:22.682
Ah, it's no problem.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.217
So, anyway, it's two months.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.351
-The penguin doesn't eat.
-Hm!

01:25.418 --> 01:27.220
He just waits
for that egg to hatch.

01:27.287 --> 01:30.290
When I saw that, I was like,
"Go, Dad! Nice commitment."

01:30.356 --> 01:32.425
The lion, on the other hand,
totally hands-off.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.394
He's like a lazy pig.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.528
Pig! Oh!

01:35.595 --> 01:37.430
Steve, Steve, listen,
you gotta quit

01:37.497 --> 01:40.366
watching Animal Planet
and talk to your girlfriend.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.868
I don't know
what I'm gonna tell her.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.536
Wait. You've been talking
my ear off for an hour

01:43.603 --> 01:45.271
about fatherhood in the wild.
What's to decide?

01:45.338 --> 01:48.241
Taking responsibility for this
baby is a huge step for me.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.876
Trust me. Every now and then,

01:49.943 --> 01:52.612
jumping into the unknown
is not a bad thing.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.414
This is you.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.151
Take the step.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.320
Good luck, Dylan.

02:00.386 --> 02:01.287
Okay.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.192
(woman speaking indistinctly,
phone ringing)

02:06.259 --> 02:07.827
(clears throat)

02:07.894 --> 02:10.864
(bell dings twice)

02:10.930 --> 02:12.398
They told me to speak to you.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.801
(sighs)

02:14.868 --> 02:16.903
Did they also tell you
that appointments are preferred?

02:16.970 --> 02:20.173
Listen, I, uh, I was just over
trying to register,

02:20.240 --> 02:22.141
and apparently my name
isn't in the computer.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.877
All right. Name?

02:23.943 --> 02:26.179
McKay, Dylan.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.214
Dylan McKay...

02:29.382 --> 02:33.186
McKay... "Dylan McKay."

02:34.387 --> 02:36.389
Well, your application
was denied.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.391
Should've gotten a letter.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.526
I moved.

02:39.592 --> 02:42.195
A member of my admissions team
reviewed your material

02:42.262 --> 02:44.264
and found your essay more
a mockery

02:44.330 --> 02:45.431
than a statement of purpose.

02:45.498 --> 02:49.502
I do believe you were in search
of "life, liberty and...

02:49.569 --> 02:52.171
the perfect wave."

02:52.238 --> 02:53.306
Yeah, um, you know,

02:53.373 --> 02:55.875
they want you to sum up
your-your academic aspirations,

02:55.942 --> 02:58.745
as well as your plans for the
future, in 500 words or less.

02:58.811 --> 02:59.746
Who can do that?

02:59.812 --> 03:02.615
About 3,000 would-be students.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.285
(sighs)
There was more to the essay.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.755
Yes, you were torn between
basket weaving and astrophysics.

03:08.821 --> 03:11.224
I just wanted to lighten it up
a little bit, you know?

03:11.291 --> 03:13.293
You did a sufficient job
of that now, didn't you?

03:13.359 --> 03:14.827
You're not letting me in,
are you?

03:14.894 --> 03:16.596
I'm sorry.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.631
Good luck
on your wave hunt, Mr. McKay.

You're talking
about a reopening,

05:09.909 --> 05:11.077
she's hemming pants.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.780
Buyers from New York are looking
at her men's line this week.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.381
It's a totally different thing.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.916
PIA:
Well, that's our hook--

05:16.983 --> 05:18.918
we're kicking off the party
with a fashion show.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.920
I'm thinking twinkle lights.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.422
I'm thinking
exclusive guest list.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.790
All in two days?

05:23.856 --> 05:25.058
We'll throw a panic party.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.826
L.A. is an impulsive town.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.394
The invites go out
the day before...

05:28.461 --> 05:30.029
Everyone will be terrified
of missing

05:30.096 --> 05:31.698
the newest, hottest thing.

05:31.764 --> 05:32.899
This is my players book--

05:32.965 --> 05:35.068
a Who's Who of actors, models,
rock stars.

05:35.134 --> 05:36.736
Mm, you know
what I was thinking--

05:36.803 --> 05:38.404
that place across the courtyard
is empty.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.839
We could rent it out.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.908
And we could have the post-party
right here.

05:41.974 --> 05:44.043
Chapter one: we need a fleet
of hotties on the catwalk.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.412
Call Nan Chambers Modeling
on Canon.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.715
-Book Steve, Eddie, James
and Tyler. -Got it.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.916
Kelly, you handle
the invitations,

05:49.982 --> 05:51.884
and I'll book the caterer.

05:51.951 --> 05:52.952
Pop a few charming pills,
ladies.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.054
We've got a lot of begging
to do.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.492
(knocking on glass)

05:59.559 --> 06:01.360
Come in.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.967
It's a daddy penguin.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.836
-It's for you.
-We haven't talked in days,

06:09.902 --> 06:12.505
and you just blow in here
with stuffed toys?

06:15.875 --> 06:19.112
Imagine me on the Arctic ice

06:19.178 --> 06:20.947
incubating an egg...

06:21.013 --> 06:22.014
on my webbed feet.

06:22.081 --> 06:23.082
That's disgusting.

06:23.149 --> 06:24.917
You're not listening.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.552
I'm the daddy penguin.
The penguin is me.

06:26.619 --> 06:27.854
I learned about it on TV.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.055
Terrific, but I think

06:29.122 --> 06:30.890
I'm gonna hold out
for a daddy human.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.859
You got one.

06:32.925 --> 06:35.461
You and me are gonna raise
this kid together.

06:35.528 --> 06:36.929
A weekend of nature
documentaries,

06:36.996 --> 06:38.998
and just, all of a sudden,
you're convinced?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.133
That's what I want--

06:40.199 --> 06:43.402
you, me.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.139
(voice breaking):
Really?

06:46.205 --> 06:47.974
Really.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.545
(sobbing)

06:52.612 --> 06:54.914
I'm so happy
because I just kept thinking,

06:54.981 --> 06:55.882
"What if he says no?"

06:55.948 --> 06:57.884
Well, I'm saying yes.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.887
(sobs)
Oh, the penguin's drowning.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.989
Well, listen,
now that I'm on board,

07:03.055 --> 07:04.957
what's next?

07:05.024 --> 07:06.926
Um, oh...

07:06.993 --> 07:09.796
Well, I have a checkup
with my obstetrician tonight,

07:09.862 --> 07:11.597
but if that's too much
too soon...

07:11.664 --> 07:13.065
No, no, I'll go with you.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.001
And don't worry about Harry.

07:15.067 --> 07:18.104
His densely packed feathers
provide a waterproof coat.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.948
(screams)

07:29.015 --> 07:30.616
(David laughs)

07:30.683 --> 07:32.552
All right, uh,
just give me one more.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.853
David, I'm totally crazed.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.823
I don't have time to sit around
and record stupid sound effects.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.891
It's classic.
Callers say something stupid,

07:38.958 --> 07:41.227
-this is what they hear.
-(scream plays)

07:41.294 --> 07:42.929
Sounds like you can't wait
to use it.

07:42.995 --> 07:45.598
Guess you haven't listened
to my show lately.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.533
CDs for David Silver.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.068
-Here you are, man.
-Beautiful. Thank you.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.070
Hey. How's it going?

07:51.137 --> 07:54.040
Good. Congratulations
on the reopening.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.541
Thank you.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.643
I, um, I hope you can make it.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.945
Yeah, actually, I can't.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.179
I'm going to Napa Valley
with Cherise.

08:00.246 --> 08:01.180
Sounds fun.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.615
Yeah.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.184
I'll see you later.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.019
-Bye.
-See ya.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.091
I could use
one more take on that.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.159
Oh, yeah.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.927
Thanks.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.963
(scream echoes over speaker)

08:17.029 --> 08:19.031
Nice one.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.672
Hi.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.075
Hey.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.244
You know what I like about you?

08:31.310 --> 08:32.912
Please tell me.

08:32.979 --> 08:36.716
You didn't like the winter,
so you moved to L.A.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.251
You didn't like the big firms,
so you started your own.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.988
You are exactly
where you want to be.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.990
And I take it you're not.

08:44.056 --> 08:47.026
Yes, well,
what have we got here?

08:47.093 --> 08:48.895
That sandwich that you like.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.930
Hmm. Well, thank you.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.900
Guess that's a pretty good
apology for blowing off lunch.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.668
No, I didn't blow you off.
I called.

08:55.735 --> 08:57.270
I never got a message.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.138
You know what?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.674
You need to get rid of that
stellar assistant of yours.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.309
Mm-hm...

09:03.376 --> 09:08.981
Sorry. I'm just a little
stressed right now.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.950
I'm guessing the reopening
has been difficult.

09:11.017 --> 09:11.918
Understatement.

09:11.984 --> 09:15.221
The closer it gets,
the more trapped I feel.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.289
You should just quit.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.490
I can't quit now.

09:17.556 --> 09:21.327
If something isn't sitting
right, you have to address it.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.329
Otherwise, you'll keep
making excuses to stay.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.131
I guess that's one of the
pitfalls of incorporating

09:25.197 --> 09:26.132
with your best friend.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.034
Well, have you talked to Donna?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.235
No, it's not a good time.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.970
I mean,
we're both on the verge.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.106
And I just want to make sure
that my jitters are about

09:34.173 --> 09:38.177
needing something new,
not wanting to run away.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.212
You don't run away
from anything.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.014
I know that for a fact.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.152
-GINA: Hi.
-MATT: Hey.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.988
-KELLY: Gotta go.
-MATT: Halt!

09:49.055 --> 09:51.324
Halt, halt...

09:51.390 --> 09:52.625
halt.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.294
I'm arranging
a cease-fire here, okay?

09:55.361 --> 09:57.330
-Why, who's fighting? -Gina,
stop blocking Kelly's calls.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.198
-I'm not blocking...
-Kelly, don't march out of here

09:59.265 --> 10:01.067
-every time Gina comes in.
-I don't run out of here.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.069
I'm not asking you two
to be friends,

10:03.135 --> 10:05.171
just civil, for my sake.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.175
-Fine.
-Fine.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.743
Thank you.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.047
Bye, Kelly. See you later.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.084
See? That's not trying,

10:18.150 --> 10:19.819
that snotty little look
on her face.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.821
I don't want to hear it, please.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.292
WOMAN:
<i>Blood pressure's normal.</i>

10:26.359 --> 10:28.060
No signs of edema.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.362
How's dad over there?

10:29.428 --> 10:31.030
How you doing, honey?

10:31.097 --> 10:32.131
I'm fine.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.700
I usually don't see dads
till later in the pregnancy.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.702
I'm here now, Dr. Long.

10:36.769 --> 10:37.837
I'm glad.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.405
Janet just goes on and on

10:39.472 --> 10:40.840
about how wonderful you are.

10:40.906 --> 10:42.174
Lie down now.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.046
I'm not gonna let you
intimidate me.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.814
I'm in charge here.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.283
DOCTOR: We'll run the Doppler,
and then you're done.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.418
Doppler?

10:52.485 --> 10:53.719
That sounds painful.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.688
Oh, it's just a microphone.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.790
It enables us to hear
the baby's heartbeat.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.793
Do you know how glad I am
you're here?

11:04.864 --> 11:05.765
(rhythmic whooshing)

11:05.831 --> 11:07.166
There it is.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.068
Sounds perfect.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.403
(rhythmic whooshing continues)

11:10.469 --> 11:13.072
Oh, isn't that amazing?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.875
It's unbelievable.

11:15.941 --> 11:16.976
JANET:
It's such a strong heartbeat.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.078
It's such a strong baby....
(echoing): strong baby.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.147
(whooshing grows louder)

11:28.888 --> 11:32.024
It was so strong,
like a little hummingbird.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.692
Oh, that must have
been incredible.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.895
Just talking about it
makes me want to cry.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.030
-How is Steve?
-Did he freak out?

11:38.097 --> 11:39.965
He was so excited
he could barely speak.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.202
He's going to be a great father.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.870
I'm gonna be a horrible father.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.238
Steve, you got to relax.

11:46.305 --> 11:49.208
Relax?
Look who you're talking to.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.810
I'm Steve Sanders.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.078
I'm the original party animal.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.779
I'm an irresponsible goofball.
I'm...

11:53.846 --> 11:55.481
Well, you've had your moments,
I'll give you that, Steve.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.582
Thank you very much.

11:56.649 --> 11:57.550
Ladies and gentlemen,
my good friend Dylan McKay.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.819
You were pretty good
with Carly's kid, right?

11:59.885 --> 12:03.022
Mmm, we were more
like playmates.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.158
Look, I need you guys to give me
some good information.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.227
I don't know, Steve,
you're kind of the trailblazer.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.229
Why don't you
just call your dad.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.364
I want this to be a decision
I'm proud of.

12:12.431 --> 12:15.301
If I call him now, I'll...
I'll panic.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.435
My voice will crack.

12:16.502 --> 12:19.138
I'll be reduced to that
blubbering little 16-year-old

12:19.205 --> 12:20.439
who just had his car stolen.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.180
KELLY:
<i>Matt, hi.</i>

12:28.247 --> 12:29.381
(over phone):
I just left Donna.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.184
I couldn't bring myself to
mention what we talked about.

12:32.251 --> 12:35.221
You're not there and I'm staring
down my future.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.356
-Call me.
-(machine beeps)

12:37.423 --> 12:39.024
Hey, um...

12:39.091 --> 12:41.160
Have you seen the Robinson file?

12:41.227 --> 12:43.195
Yeah, it's on...
right on your desk.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.397
Okay.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.900
I have this message for you
from Kelly Taylor,

12:47.967 --> 12:49.902
who called at exactly 10:52,

12:49.969 --> 12:51.937
and she wanted to talk to you

12:52.004 --> 12:54.907
about some heart-to-heart
with Donna.

12:54.974 --> 12:55.975
Thank you.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.877
Mm-hmm.

12:57.943 --> 12:58.978
So what's the heart-to-heart
about?

12:59.044 --> 13:02.047
-It's none of your business.
-Right.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.850
-You know what?
-Hmm?

13:04.917 --> 13:06.218
I think we're done for the day.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.219
Really? It's so early.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.455
Yeah, well, if you want to stay
on the clock,

13:09.522 --> 13:11.924
I'm sure Donna and Kelly could
use some help at the store.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.259
(laughing)

13:14.527 --> 13:18.097
Matt, uh, look,
forcing us to hang out

13:18.164 --> 13:21.233
isn't going to make us friends,
trust me.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.336
I know.
Just try, huh? A little bit?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.474
Are you sure that's not
going to blow a fuse?

13:28.541 --> 13:31.477
I've done this a million times.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.078
Hi.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.313
What do you want?

13:34.380 --> 13:36.982
I'm here to work.

13:37.049 --> 13:37.917
Well, if you don't like it,

13:37.983 --> 13:39.318
you can talk
to your boyfriend about it.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.920
Flawless. I remember you.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.321
You're stuffing invitations.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.390
The messenger will be here
at 8:00.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.991
Now if I can just find

13:46.058 --> 13:47.359
Michael Stipe's address.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.128
Oh, you know what?

13:49.195 --> 13:51.230
I was thinking about getting
back into personal training.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.265
Maybe we could do a little
brainstorming.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.968
I don't share this information
with just anyone.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.203
It simply isn't here.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.538
Oh, well, you know what?

13:59.605 --> 14:01.974
I have a friend who I think
she knows him.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.108
I'll just give her a call.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.344
You think like a publicist,
Kelly.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.246
Ever think of joining our ranks?

14:07.313 --> 14:09.448
-We can talk about that later.
-Oh, so you're interested?

14:10.616 --> 14:15.287
Oh, I gave Matt that message
about your future, I guess.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.224
Got a lot of big decisions
ahead, huh?

14:21.627 --> 14:23.195
(electrical crackling)

14:24.496 --> 14:25.931
Okay, that makes me nervous.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.433
Please.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.435
Oh, drop me off at the florist's
on your way to the club.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.570
-And, Gidget...
-Gina.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.172
Whatever. Make sure that
Christian Sutton's invite

14:33.239 --> 14:34.340
is on the top of the stack.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.541
He's the critic
from the <i> Chronicle</i>

14:35.608 --> 14:37.042
whose review
can make or break us.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.578
-Got that?
-Got it.

14:39.645 --> 14:40.579
Good.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.448
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.049
KELLY: Listen, I'm going
to the After Dark.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.452
-I'll be back in just
a little bit. -Okay.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.354
Gina, what are you doing here?

14:48.420 --> 14:50.356
-I'm helping.
-Really?

14:50.422 --> 14:51.323
Haven't seen you much

14:51.390 --> 14:52.358
since you moved out
of the beach apartment.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.326
Matt's paying me.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.995
Oh, my bad.
Thought you were being nice.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.463
-Uh-uh.
-Anyway...

14:57.529 --> 14:59.465
Gina, meet my men's line.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.333
If this takes off,
instant capital.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.068
Oh, right. I guess
you'll probably need it

15:03.135 --> 15:04.203
after Kelly quits the store.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.471
What?

15:05.537 --> 15:07.072
She was just talking
to Matt about it,

15:07.139 --> 15:08.274
and then Pia offered
her the job. I just assumed...

15:08.340 --> 15:10.109
She hasn't said
anything to me.

15:10.175 --> 15:14.179
Well, I guess retail can be
pretty cutthroat, huh?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.488
(mellow rock music playing)

15:22.554 --> 15:24.089
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.424
I'm here for the wine glasses.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.625
Yeah, Dylan's bringing
them right down.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.028
Oh, okay. Thanks.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.204
Erich, big man, you're on.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.508
So I did what you said--
cut my ex-girlfriend off.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.410
Hey, if she's not
sleeping with you,

15:44.476 --> 15:46.512
you shouldn't be
paying her rent.

15:46.578 --> 15:47.246
How'd she take it?

15:47.313 --> 15:49.515
She begged me
to move back in.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.383
(recording of Donna screaming)

15:51.450 --> 15:52.584
Mm. Did you?

15:52.651 --> 15:53.585
No way.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.387
(recording of applause)

15:55.454 --> 15:57.323
Good man.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.391
High and dry
is the only way to go.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.662
Congratulations. You just
graduated from loser to winner.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.297
(chuckles)

16:05.364 --> 16:06.398
Harsh.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.467
Hey, if you want a pat
on the back, call your grandma.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.568
How you doing?

16:09.635 --> 16:13.405
Hmm, I just pulled my fourth
all-nighter this week.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.407
Started with writing Dylan's
college recommendation,

16:15.474 --> 16:16.542
and just went downhill
from there.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.577
(laughs)
Dylan's going to college?

16:18.644 --> 16:22.581
Yeah, he wants to, but C.U.
rejected his application.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.417
Oh, let me guess--
he did a half-assed job

16:25.484 --> 16:27.419
and tried making them feel
like they owed him a spot.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.221
-David.
-What?

16:29.288 --> 16:30.656
The guy's a screwup, all right?

16:30.723 --> 16:32.624
First he wastes his time,
and now he's wasting yours.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.059
Am I wrong?

16:34.126 --> 16:36.495
Exactly.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.063
DYLAN:
Exactly.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.498
Dylan.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.166
Your glasses are in the car.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.435
David, I think you should
apologize.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.437
For what, telling the truth?

16:45.504 --> 16:48.607
No.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.514
What?

16:56.749 --> 16:59.585
(chuckles)
What?

17:02.454 --> 17:04.390
(sighs)

17:05.656 --> 17:07.593
Men's room needs restocking.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.228
So?

17:09.294 --> 17:11.430
So the bar's packed
and I'm swamped, man.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.133
Well, it's not my job.

17:14.199 --> 17:18.337
Why are you sitting here eight
hours a day behind this desk?

17:18.404 --> 17:19.671
(sighs)

17:41.727 --> 17:43.429
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:43.495 --> 17:47.266
Okay, so I thought
we'd drive up PCH, yeah?

17:47.332 --> 17:48.434
I thought we were flying.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.470
Well, I mean, this will,
you know, take a little longer,

17:51.537 --> 17:54.273
but the view's supposed
to be really beautiful.

17:54.339 --> 17:55.207
It's eight hours.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.409
Well, so we bring
a mix tape, you know.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.178
Look, we're gonna have a blast.

18:01.313 --> 18:02.614
If we're moving too quickly,
just, um...

18:02.681 --> 18:06.452
If it's PCH you want,
PCH you get.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.454
Thanks.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.266
Hi. Oh, God, don't tell me
we double booked.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.268
I thought I was in charge
of glasses.

18:23.335 --> 18:25.237
Kel, I'm sorry,
but you should have told me.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.439
-What?
-Are you leaving the store?

18:27.506 --> 18:29.575
Okay, wait a minute...

18:29.641 --> 18:31.477
I get this information
from Gina?

18:31.543 --> 18:34.279
No, no, there is no information,
Donna.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.315
I know you going
back to the store

18:36.381 --> 18:37.483
was the hardest thing
you've ever done,

18:37.549 --> 18:40.185
and I also know I've been
leaning on you a lot, but...

18:40.252 --> 18:42.387
Donna, I really don't think
this is the time or the place

18:42.454 --> 18:43.522
to talk about this.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.624
-But we will talk about it?
-Yes.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.626
We just have a lot
on our plates right now.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.729
Let's just get through
tomorrow, okay?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.298
Okay.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.567
JANET:
<i>You look very handsome tonight.</i>

18:55.634 --> 18:56.835
Thank you.

18:56.902 --> 18:58.704
You look beautiful.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.372
Honey, your foot's on mine.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.708
I know.
I'm flirting with you.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.477
-Oh, right.
-(baby crying)

19:05.544 --> 19:07.412
JANET:
Mmm...

19:07.479 --> 19:11.383
God, no wonder they call it
the Chocolate Orgasm.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.551
Orgasm what?

19:13.585 --> 19:14.720
Are you okay?

19:14.786 --> 19:17.756
Yeah. I'm just having a little
trouble thinking clearly.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.590
JANET:
Mmm.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.360
Oh, he's adorable.

19:21.426 --> 19:22.461
(crying continues)

19:22.528 --> 19:23.829
Some set of lungs.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.265
Do you know that I used
to hear stuff like that

19:26.331 --> 19:27.366
and it would bother me.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.568
But now I just think,
soon that's going to be us.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.570
I read that
when a new mother

19:31.637 --> 19:35.741
hears her baby cry,
she involuntarily lactates.

19:36.742 --> 19:37.743
Isn't that beautiful?

19:37.809 --> 19:39.278
(crying continues)

19:39.344 --> 19:41.280
Do you think he's hungry?
He sure is loud.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.749
Well, just try and concentrate,
okay?

19:43.815 --> 19:44.783
And block it out.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.452
(crying continues)

19:49.855 --> 19:51.456
Is that better?

19:51.523 --> 19:52.491
Yeah.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.426
It's like
I don't hear it at all.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.562
(crying grows louder)

20:06.338 --> 20:08.340
(sighs)

20:09.541 --> 20:12.578
Voila.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.513
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.549
You know what, let me just,
um...

20:17.616 --> 20:19.751
I'll deliver this
to the <i> Chronicle</i> myself.

20:19.818 --> 20:21.587
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

20:44.509 --> 20:45.510
(gasps)

21:14.640 --> 21:17.476
-Oh, my God!
-No.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.611
GINA: The, uh, the twinkle
lights shorted out

21:19.678 --> 21:21.613
and there were sparks
flying everywhere,

21:21.680 --> 21:23.615
and everything just went up.

21:24.716 --> 21:25.884
Thank God I was here.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.387
You could have lost
the whole store.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.569
What's going on?

21:44.636 --> 21:45.671
Fire at the store.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.005
Anybody hurt?

21:47.072 --> 21:49.474
No, but the place
is a mess.

21:49.541 --> 21:50.909
I'm helping them
with the cleanup.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.744
The reopening's today.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.012
That's right;
that's why it's a disaster.

21:54.079 --> 21:54.880
(doorbell ringing)

21:54.946 --> 21:57.416
-Would you get the door for me?
-Yeah.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.850
Hey.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.386
I come bearing enough high-carb
junk food

22:01.453 --> 22:02.754
to get us past Montecito.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.423
Montecito. Have fun, guys.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.892
-NOAH: Yeah.
-CHERISE: Okay, thanks.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.760
-(car door opens, closes)
-What's going on?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.796
Uh, there's an emergency
at Kelly's boutique.

22:10.862 --> 22:11.897
-She might need us.
-(engine starting)

22:11.963 --> 22:13.999
Thought it was Donna's boutique.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.635
Yeah. Um, can you give me
half an hour?

22:16.702 --> 22:18.503
Just a half an hour.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.672
It's all I need.
Then we'll go on our way, okay?

22:20.739 --> 22:21.773
Mmm, yeah.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.442
Okay.

22:26.778 --> 22:27.579
(sighs)

22:27.646 --> 22:29.981
Screw it. I'll just wear
the drawstrings.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.784
Looks like I'm gonna have
to go shopping

22:32.851 --> 22:36.455
for new clothes <i> again.</i>

22:36.521 --> 22:37.956
Or maybe I'll just walk
around naked.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.791
What do you think of that?

22:39.858 --> 22:40.959
Yeah.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.628
(phone rings)

22:45.831 --> 22:47.532
Hello.

22:47.599 --> 22:48.900
Hi, Mr. Sanders.

22:49.901 --> 22:52.504
Actually, he's not here
right now,

22:52.571 --> 22:54.439
so I'll just tell him
you called?

22:54.506 --> 22:55.841
Okay, bye.

23:01.646 --> 23:05.584
Steve, you haven't said
a word since last night.

23:05.650 --> 23:08.587
Suddenly, I'm dating a zombie,
and I don't appreciate it.

23:08.653 --> 23:10.555
(sighs)

23:10.622 --> 23:11.923
Was your dad happy to find out

23:11.990 --> 23:13.592
that he's gonna be
a grandfather?

23:13.658 --> 23:15.694
I haven't told him.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.763
You're hiding it. How assuring.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.898
Well, you didn't exactly send
your parents a singing telegram,

23:19.965 --> 23:22.100
now, did you?

23:22.167 --> 23:24.903
Look, the crying baby
last night,

23:24.970 --> 23:26.705
it blew me away.

23:26.772 --> 23:32.577
You've had so much more time
to adjust to this than I have.

23:32.644 --> 23:33.712
I'm scared.

23:33.779 --> 23:37.783
I'm scared I'm not ready
for this.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.785
You can't say that.

23:39.851 --> 23:41.820
You're not allowed to say that.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.789
I'm just telling you
how I feel.

23:43.855 --> 23:46.691
You gave me a penguin!

23:48.927 --> 23:50.896
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

23:50.962 --> 23:53.698
You'd get my hopes up,
and then you'd disappear.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.766
Look, I'm here.
I'm right here.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.101
I'm sitting
right next to you, okay?

23:56.168 --> 23:57.903
I haven't disappeared.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.874
I'm just torn.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.877
Well, torn isn't an option,
Steve.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.680
I need you to be
a hundred percent,

24:08.747 --> 24:11.783
and anything in-between
just isn't fair.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.518
(knocking)

24:13.585 --> 24:15.687
We need some extra hands.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.122
Yeah, okay.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.573
Second time's a charm.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.074
Wonderful.
I'll read it next year.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.008
What?

24:37.075 --> 24:38.910
We're no longer accepting
applications.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.847
I don't think
anybody is, uh, gonna die

24:41.913 --> 24:43.949
if you bend the rules
a little bit.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.885
Mr. McKay,
there's nothing to bend.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.887
This isn't a raffle.

24:48.954 --> 24:51.690
You don't get to enter
as many times as you like.

24:51.756 --> 24:53.558
You aren't even gonna read it,
are you?

24:53.625 --> 24:54.125
You were denied.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.728
It's as simple as that.

24:59.865 --> 25:02.801
I've worked with Hugh Grant
and Courtney Love.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.169
This is hardly a disaster.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.071
Okay, we have eight hours.

25:06.137 --> 25:08.106
We'll just redo the outfits.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.941
Seven suits, five shirts,
neckwear,

25:10.008 --> 25:11.076
cargo pants, French seams!

25:11.142 --> 25:13.078
Do you know how to sew
a buttonhole?

25:13.144 --> 25:15.580
It takes time.
More time than we've got.

25:15.647 --> 25:16.948
STEVE:
All righty!

25:17.015 --> 25:19.951
Okay, I'm gonna put
the sewing machine over there.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.987
DONNA:
What are you guys doing here?

25:22.053 --> 25:23.788
We stopped by
the beach apartment

25:23.855 --> 25:25.090
-and picked up all your stuff.
-We're all here to help, okay?

25:25.156 --> 25:26.725
(sighs)

25:26.791 --> 25:29.995
Thanks! Okay, um,
just, uh, put the sewing machine

25:30.061 --> 25:31.630
over there.
Plug it into the outlet.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.864
-Um...
-JANET: All right, okay.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.099
We'll just start cutting
new patterns.

25:34.165 --> 25:35.834
And, Janet, can you grab
extra scissors

25:35.901 --> 25:37.002
-right in the top drawer
over there? -Mm-hmm.

25:37.068 --> 25:40.205
Um... David, the red fabric,
move that from the house.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.842
Okay, great. Um, just, uh...

25:43.909 --> 25:46.845
You got a sec?

25:46.912 --> 25:48.213
Mm-hmm.

25:51.182 --> 25:52.851
I'm off the clock.

25:52.918 --> 25:56.121
What?

25:56.187 --> 25:59.858
People used to drive
from three counties away

25:59.925 --> 26:01.793
to see my family's house
at Christmastime.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.762
That's great.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.864
Therefore, I know exactly
how many twinkle lights

26:05.931 --> 26:08.099
your basic outlet can handle
before sparks fly.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.868
Yeah, I was really scared.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.203
Mmm. What's under your shirt?

26:19.077 --> 26:20.912
It was an accident.

26:22.347 --> 26:23.815
Look, Matt,
it was completely a mistake.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.850
I was playing with this candle
and it dropped--

26:25.917 --> 26:27.152
Everything has to be put back
perfectly, okay?

26:27.218 --> 26:28.286
That means you in the trenches,

26:28.353 --> 26:29.788
fingers to the bone,
no coffee breaks.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.690
Now, who-who-who's this?

26:31.756 --> 26:32.857
Who-who's Christian Sutton?

26:32.924 --> 26:33.758
He's a really important critic
from the <i> Chronicle.</i>

26:33.825 --> 26:36.294
-Yeah? Well, go find him.
-Find him?!

26:36.361 --> 26:37.929
Find him!

26:40.966 --> 26:42.200
Find him.

26:45.236 --> 26:47.772
(door closes)

26:47.839 --> 26:48.640
I already set up
the sound booth,

26:48.707 --> 26:50.075
so as soon as I connect
the speakers,

26:50.141 --> 26:51.810
I'll show you
how all this stuff works.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.912
JANET: Okay. It's unbelievable
this space was available

26:53.979 --> 26:54.980
across the courtyard.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.182
You know, David, somewhere
in all your bitterness,

26:57.248 --> 26:59.985
you may have found
a little wisdom.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.820
The school thing

27:01.886 --> 27:03.855
was a waste
of everybody's time.

27:19.337 --> 27:22.841
Okay, you guys,
seven hours and counting.

27:22.907 --> 27:25.844
My record for putting together
a dress is five.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.947
So this is basically a study
in denial.

27:31.049 --> 27:32.217
DYLAN:
Hey.

27:32.283 --> 27:34.986
I, uh, I got the message
at the hotel.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.889
Thanks. So what are you gonna do
about C.U.?

27:37.956 --> 27:41.726
Oh, I don't know.
It's out of my hands now.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.795
Okay, raise your hands.
Who can sew?

27:45.163 --> 27:46.097
Thread a needle?

27:46.164 --> 27:47.132
STEVE:
Kinda.

27:47.198 --> 27:49.768
Cut in a straight line?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.302
-I got the scissors right here,
baby. -Oh, I can...

27:51.369 --> 27:52.837

Okay, David, you're up next.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.748
Fix your collar.

31:56.814 --> 31:58.483
Matt, you have one more outfit
on the rack in there, okay?

31:58.549 --> 32:00.118
NOAH:
You look good, buddy.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.086
Okay, we have to change
for the finale.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.187
DONNA:
Geez!

32:07.191 --> 32:08.593
I'm sorry we're running so late.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.395
Yeah, I don't want
to go anymore.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.996
We can just go tomorrow.

32:12.063 --> 32:12.664
No, I mean ever.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.199
I just spent the entire day

32:15.266 --> 32:16.467
being completely ignored
by you.

32:16.534 --> 32:18.636
Just go home
and I'll call you, okay?

32:18.703 --> 32:20.605
I'd rather do this in person.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.006
What?

32:22.073 --> 32:23.274
Break up.

Except your cumberbund's
still upside down.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.730
Seriously.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.698
I think we took
an impossible situation

33:20.765 --> 33:22.600
and we made it work.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.038
You and I should do
the same thing.

33:27.105 --> 33:30.041
You think what we have
is impossible?

33:30.108 --> 33:33.010
Okay, bad choice of words.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.415
You and I should do
the right thing.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.450
Janet...

33:39.517 --> 33:41.552
I want to be a dad.

33:43.621 --> 33:45.490
And I want to be a husband.

33:45.556 --> 33:46.758
(laughing)

33:46.824 --> 33:47.792
Excuse me?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.494
We should get married.

33:50.828 --> 33:52.730
Wha-wha...?

33:54.532 --> 33:57.769
Um, are you sure about this,

33:57.835 --> 34:00.471
because I can't handle
another about-face.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.307
I'm absolutely positive.

34:03.374 --> 34:07.078
Well, then yeah,
we should get married.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.620
(applause)

34:15.686 --> 34:17.688
(cheering)

34:22.159 --> 34:24.128
(cheering and whooping)

34:39.911 --> 34:41.646
MAN:
Bravo.

34:50.487 --> 34:52.489
I think the show
went really well.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.326
Thanks. And I'm sorry
for jumping all over you.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.795
I'm sorry, I should have told
you where I was at with that.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.730
(both laughing)

34:59.797 --> 35:01.866
Hey, we're going to go check out
the review of the <i> Chronicle,</i>

35:01.933 --> 35:03.768
so do you want
to come with us?

35:03.835 --> 35:05.870
-We're gonna get breakfast.
-Oh, I already ate.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.539
Well, is there anything
you need while we're out?

35:08.606 --> 35:10.508
Uh, maybe a tranquillizer.

35:10.575 --> 35:11.876
Steve and I are getting married.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.378
(laughing)

35:15.413 --> 35:16.714
Congratulations!

35:16.781 --> 35:19.550
Tell us every detail.
Did he get down on one knee?

35:19.617 --> 35:20.818
-No.
-Where's the ring?

35:20.885 --> 35:22.487
Oh, um, well, we still have
to pick it out.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.755
-Oh.
-Where did it happen?

35:24.822 --> 35:26.390
Well, it was just a
spur-of-the-moment thing

35:26.457 --> 35:27.525
during the show.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.527
It was just a good
practical proposal.

35:29.594 --> 35:31.596
I knew he'd come through.

35:31.662 --> 35:33.464
It's like your whole life
is wrapped up

35:33.531 --> 35:34.665
with a big red bow.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.801
I just hope he doesn't feel
strangled by it.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.703
No, there's no way.

35:40.438 --> 35:41.472
I'm so happy for you.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.140
Thank you.

35:43.207 --> 35:46.744
All right, well,
we'll plan it later.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.513
Bye.

35:48.579 --> 35:50.581
See you later,
Mrs. Sanders.

35:51.616 --> 35:53.618
(door closes)

35:58.956 --> 36:01.626
(bell dings)

36:03.461 --> 36:05.396
Dropping this off
for Dylan McKay.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.465
Uh, that won't be necessary.

36:07.532 --> 36:09.166
You know, you're, uh,
you're shortchanging someone

36:09.233 --> 36:10.768
that could really use
the chance.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.470
Mister...?

36:12.537 --> 36:13.938
David Silver. Graduated in '97.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.507
Well, alumni recommendations,
Mr. Silver,

36:16.574 --> 36:17.808
should be in written,
not oral, form.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.644
Besides, our classes
are at capacity...

36:19.710 --> 36:23.781
My-my freshman year at C.U.,
I was, uh,

36:23.848 --> 36:26.450
I was working the graveyard
shift at the radio station.

36:26.517 --> 36:27.552
I was sleeping through classes

36:27.618 --> 36:29.720
and doing stuff
that I still regret.

36:29.787 --> 36:32.924
Before I know it,
I'm two research papers behind.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.726
So I'm thinking, you know,
I'll drop the classes.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.828
And Dylan shows up
at my front door

36:37.895 --> 36:39.797
with a stack of books
from the library,

36:39.864 --> 36:43.668
and, uh, says... (chuckles)

36:43.734 --> 36:45.870
he says that, uh,
he doesn't hang with quitters.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.805
And he stayed,

36:47.872 --> 36:50.875
for three days,
until I finished.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.176
Look, I appreciate...

36:52.243 --> 36:56.213
Somewhere between then and now,
Dylan turned into what he hated.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.283
He's been through hell
and he's going to appreciate

36:59.350 --> 37:02.853
this a lot more
than the pimply-faced freshman

37:02.920 --> 37:04.589
whose parents are forcing him
to come.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.624
You know, I think you get him

37:06.691 --> 37:08.893
back on track,
he'd be unstoppable.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.628
Anyway,

37:10.695 --> 37:11.762
the essay's great.

37:11.829 --> 37:14.966
You should give it a read
before you throw it away.

37:21.872 --> 37:23.708
"Except for a cavalcade
of lummoxes passing as models,

37:23.774 --> 37:26.677
"Now Wear This reopening
made a splash.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.813
"Kelly Taylor and Donna Martin
are two up-and-comers

37:28.879 --> 37:30.648
who are here to stay."

37:30.715 --> 37:32.750
Sutton's drink
must have been spiked.

37:32.817 --> 37:34.552
He never drools like this.

37:34.619 --> 37:37.021
Now all we need
are the thumbs-up

37:37.088 --> 37:38.756
from the New York buyers.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.291
They're supposed to call
Donna later today.

37:40.358 --> 37:42.793
Here you go.

37:42.860 --> 37:43.828
For services rendered.

37:43.894 --> 37:45.896
May I be candid?

37:45.963 --> 37:47.865
You have killer publicist
in your blood.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.000
Thank you, I think.

37:49.066 --> 37:50.935
Think about this.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.637
Our company has an opening.
Interested?

37:52.703 --> 37:56.007
If you had asked me
two days ago, maybe,

37:56.073 --> 37:58.709
but, for now, I'm happy here.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.711
Our loss.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.316
Mm. Have you seen
my players book?

38:05.383 --> 38:06.751
No.

38:06.817 --> 38:08.686
I could have sworn
it was in my purse.

38:08.753 --> 38:09.887
Must have left it in the car.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.756
Ciao.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.560
-Hi.
-Bye.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.766
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

38:21.832 --> 38:23.334
-And you're smiling.
-Mm-hmm.

38:23.401 --> 38:25.836
-Closure feels good.
-Mm-hmm.

38:25.903 --> 38:29.073
And a... add a little dash
of success.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.608
No more feeling trapped?

38:30.675 --> 38:31.976
No.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.045
Well, how about now?

38:34.111 --> 38:35.946
No.

38:36.013 --> 38:38.349
How about... now?

38:38.416 --> 38:40.651
Mm-mm.

38:50.094 --> 38:51.696
Nice to see you again.

38:51.762 --> 38:52.830
Thanks for your help.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.098
-Yeah.
-Oh, and by the way,

38:54.165 --> 38:56.567
good luck with your little
fitness venture.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.636
Well, thank you.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.650
STEVE: <i> Got a major leak</i>
<i>going on down here.</i>

39:12.717 --> 39:14.085
<i>Can you hand me</i>
<i>that monkey wrench, please?</i>

39:14.151 --> 39:15.953
-Thanks.
-Steve, the only tool

39:16.020 --> 39:18.355
you know how to use
is the Yellow Pages.

39:18.422 --> 39:19.957
Well, that was before I bought

39:20.024 --> 39:21.692
that how-to book.

39:21.759 --> 39:24.762
I'm gonna brush up
on my handyman skills.

39:27.498 --> 39:30.668
That's not bad for a future
father and husband, huh?

39:30.735 --> 39:32.670
Steve...

39:32.737 --> 39:34.004
I'm turning down your proposal.

39:34.071 --> 39:36.674
-What?
-Marriage should be about love,

39:36.741 --> 39:37.908
not duty, you know?

39:37.975 --> 39:41.045
And... although your asking me
was the perfect thing to do,

39:41.112 --> 39:43.681
I can't help feeling like
it was for the wrong reason.

39:43.748 --> 39:44.949
You accepted.

39:45.015 --> 39:46.851
You looked me right in the eye
and said yes.

39:46.917 --> 39:48.085
Because I'm scrambling

39:48.152 --> 39:50.387
-for anything stable.
-I don't get it.

39:50.454 --> 39:52.423
I put my best foot forward,
and you push me away.

39:52.490 --> 39:53.858
That's my point exactly,

39:53.924 --> 39:55.860
is I don't want
to push anything.

39:55.926 --> 39:59.063
-You know? I'm confused.
-And finally, I'm not.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.798
(quietly):
Let's get married.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.032
Steve, I said no.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.135
Please respect that.

40:04.201 --> 40:05.936
I can't win with you, can I?

40:06.003 --> 40:06.837
Steve...

40:06.904 --> 40:07.938
Just go.

40:09.473 --> 40:10.407
Go.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.418
(door closes)

40:27.057 --> 40:29.894
(music playing,
door bell jingles)

40:29.960 --> 40:31.162
Bad day?

40:31.228 --> 40:32.763
(wry laugh)

40:32.830 --> 40:34.098
Been worse.

40:34.165 --> 40:37.168
I think I got something
for that.

40:45.876 --> 40:48.846
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:48.913 --> 40:50.948
New York buyers
didn't come through, huh?

40:51.015 --> 40:55.986
Yeah. Too, um, similar to
a collection they already had.

40:56.053 --> 40:58.055
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

40:59.857 --> 41:01.692
So, where's Cherise?

41:01.759 --> 41:02.993
Well, we, um...

41:03.060 --> 41:04.795
we sort of broke up.

41:04.862 --> 41:07.031
-Really?
-Yeah.

41:07.097 --> 41:09.200
You want some company?

41:09.266 --> 41:11.135
Yeah.

41:11.202 --> 41:12.203
All right.

41:12.269 --> 41:13.537
Thanks.

41:13.604 --> 41:14.839
(sighs)

41:16.006 --> 41:17.875
(both laugh)

41:25.015 --> 41:26.116
DYLAN:
Hey.

41:26.183 --> 41:28.018
You know who called me today?

41:28.085 --> 41:31.522
That idiot, Lecksis,
from the admissions office...

41:32.990 --> 41:34.558
...he says I got in.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.094
-Hm.
-He also said...

41:37.161 --> 41:40.564
some pesky kid
kept stopping by on my behalf.

41:40.631 --> 41:42.800
Yeah? Well, don't get too misty.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.903
If that's the way you want it.

41:50.307 --> 41:52.243
"I slide by because I can."

41:52.309 --> 41:54.078
Where'd you get my essay?

41:54.144 --> 41:55.946
Made myself a copy;
it makes a great bookmark.

41:56.013 --> 41:59.216
"I blow through people,
I cheat myself,

41:59.283 --> 42:00.985
"and the only outcome
after four years

42:01.051 --> 42:02.586
"is sitting here
thinking up lies

42:02.653 --> 42:04.121
"that'll persuade you
to let me in.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.924
"I can't, so here's the truth.

42:06.991 --> 42:10.027
"College won't fix what's wrong,
but it'll get me closer.

42:10.094 --> 42:11.929
"I'm out of options,

42:11.996 --> 42:15.099
"I'm open to anything,
