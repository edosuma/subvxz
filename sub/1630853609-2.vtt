00:26.735 --> 00:30.948
Good morning, Molly. A new day awaits you.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.160
Many possibilities are on the horizon.

00:36.745 --> 00:41.667
Every day is an opportunity
to write a new chapter in your story.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.111
I just wanna say thank you. To all of you.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.573
The past few months have been a dark time,

01:54.656 --> 01:57.576
and I couldn't have gotten through it
without my support staff.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.455
A special thank you
to Marisol for spooning with me

02:01.538 --> 02:02.789
on my wedding anniversary.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.209
That was above and beyond.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.418
You're so warm.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.797
But I'm much better now,
and I'm off to start my new life.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.426
My first real day of work in a long,
long time.

02:14.510 --> 02:18.388
So, I guess I'll see you all at 6:30?

02:18.889 --> 02:21.225
That sounds so crazy just saying it,
doesn't it?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.435
I love you guys so much.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.021
And I just want to say,

02:26.104 --> 02:27.814
I hope this all wears off soon,

02:27.898 --> 02:30.776
and we get back to getting massages
and buying castles online.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.111
Okay. Goodbye, everybody.

02:33.195 --> 02:36.323
I guess enjoy the house while I'm gone!

02:41.286 --> 02:42.621
What do we do now?

02:43.413 --> 02:46.291
I don't know. I'm kinda gonna miss her.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.961
We could go swimming.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.703
…and that's our priority
moving forward.

04:04.786 --> 04:09.082
Hello. There's a new kid in class today.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.211
Are we doing a fun dress-up day today?

04:12.294 --> 04:14.630
Is it '90s fashion Mondays?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.591
These are just our clothes.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.177
Well, you all look fantastic.

04:21.345 --> 04:24.264
So, I just wanna say I am so excited

04:24.348 --> 04:27.935
to begin this journey
to save the world together.

04:28.018 --> 04:32.773
I just think if we all work together,
there is no problem that we can't solve.

04:32.856 --> 04:36.735
Climate change, hunger.
I mean, fuck it. World peace.

04:36.818 --> 04:41.907
The enthusiasm is appreciated, Molly,
but it's not quite that simple.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.659
The foundation is mainly focused

04:43.742 --> 04:46.203
on social services
here in Southern California.

04:46.286 --> 04:51.041
And even then, with issues this big,
money alone can't fix everything.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.751
Well, it can fix a lot of things.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.629
I mean, John used it
to make himself a little bit taller.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.589
You know, forget about it.
Let's get started.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.007
Since it's Monday morning,

04:59.091 --> 05:01.927
why don't we take five minutes
to talk about our weekends?

05:02.678 --> 05:03.679
And begin.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.723
You have a timer.
You were serious about the five minutes.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.893
Cousin Molly, stop talking.
You're wasting precious seconds.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.103
-Go.
-We need to hurry up

05:11.186 --> 05:13.564
-and talk about our weekend.
-Yeah, I'll start.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.816
I went on a hike out in Pasadena.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.818
And it was a little chilly
Saturday morning,

05:17.901 --> 05:19.820
so I doubled up on my pants.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.197
Come on, this same story again?
Every week, it's the same.

05:22.281 --> 05:26.201
It's cold, you double the pants,
it was too cloudy to see downtown.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.745
Okay, it was actually a little more hazy
than cloudy this weekend, so…

05:28.829 --> 05:29.830
Moving on.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.332
I went to eat with some
of my sorority sisters.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.835
We have tank tops that say,
"The Brunch Babes."

05:34.918 --> 05:38.255
-No. White supremacy. Next.
-Okay.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.175
I'll go. Lenny came over,

05:41.258 --> 05:44.386
and we "Netflixed and chilled,"
and then we had sex.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.347
Okay, Rhonda. Get yours.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.474
Well, I had a very dramatic weekend.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.437
Benihana. Fell on the grill.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.440
-Burned my arm. Got a free mai tai.
-Oh, my God. What happened?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.859
It's a crazy story,
so let me start at the beginning.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.862
See, at Benihana,
they make the food right in front of you.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.530
Howard, we already know that part.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.617
I roll up solo, and they sit me
with this nice Korean family

06:06.700 --> 06:08.285
celebrating their son's graduation.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.663
He got into NYU. It was his first choice.

06:11.747 --> 06:12.956
That's time.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.709
So, tomorrow we have the meeting

06:15.792 --> 06:19.213
with Councilmember Saldana
about the Alameda Street Housing Project.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.300
I can't believe how long that meeting was.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.010
What was that? Like, three hours?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.721
-It's 9:50 a.m.
-Really?

06:28.430 --> 06:30.265
And we have to be here till 6:30?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.643
We don't have to be, though.
We don't have to do anything.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.728
-That's why I'm so confused right now.
-No.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.147
This is good for me. This is what I want.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.440
What's next on the agenda?

06:38.524 --> 06:40.817
Well, Sofia gave you
these research packets to read,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.403
which cover all the organizations
that we currently fund.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.905
And then,

06:44.988 --> 06:47.324
there's this big box of additional packets

06:47.407 --> 06:51.245
that cover all the organizations
that we might possibly fund in the future.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.955
Well, I gotta power through this.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.165
Page one.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.002
-I'll go get your gloves out of the car.
-Thanks.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.441
10:14. What the fuck?

07:26.488 --> 07:29.116
Oh, my God. Hey, girl.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.451
Hey, girl, what is up?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.329
Nothing. Just reading some packets.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.124
Okay, well, listen. I have amazing news.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.334
Do you remember
that fragrance line that I told you about?

07:39.418 --> 07:43.422
Well, this bad bitch
is launching it this week.

07:45.299 --> 07:48.135
Oh, my God. That's awesome.
Congratulations.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.847
Thank you,
but you need to get to Miami right now.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.807
Dinner with the girls tomorrow night.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.810
Drinks, dancing, huge party,
the whole shebang.

07:56.894 --> 08:00.355
-Are you in?
-I would love to,

08:00.439 --> 08:02.566
but I'm kind of at work right now.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.612
Okay.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.198
Wait. Are you being serious right now?

08:09.281 --> 08:12.784
Yeah. I decided to do
a little bit more work with my foundation.

08:12.868 --> 08:16.205
Okay. Well, just tell your people
you'll be out for the week

08:16.288 --> 08:17.539
and get your butt over here.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.918
I just-- I made a commitment
to do something new here.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.338
So, I feel like I should
probably see it through.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.422
You know?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.549
I really, truly, don't know,

08:27.633 --> 08:29.968
but you are welcome here anytime.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.054
Okay, but we have to go
because the mojitos just got here.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.807
Thank you. Bye! Miss you.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.142
Bye.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.425
That's my name.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.721
I'm sorry, what's this for?

09:15.264 --> 09:16.640
Well, it's courtesy of Ms. Wells.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.685
She wanted to provide transportation
to the airport.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.562
Airp--?

09:39.288 --> 09:40.539
Surprise!

09:41.290 --> 09:43.500
Okay, excuse my language for a second,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.377
but what the fuck is going on here?

09:45.460 --> 09:48.297
Well, in the words
of the immortal wordsmith,

09:48.380 --> 09:51.466
Will Smith, "Bienvenidos a Miami."

09:52.176 --> 09:54.469
Well, not quite yet,
but we'll land in a few hours.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.638
-We're going to Miami!
-Why?

09:56.722 --> 09:58.223
Well, since I'm new here,

09:58.307 --> 10:00.726
I thought I don't really
know everyone yet,

10:00.809 --> 10:04.104
and what better way to do that
than with a fabulous bonding retreat?

10:04.188 --> 10:06.148
I don't even know
what's happening right now,

10:06.231 --> 10:08.817
but we can't just fly to Miami
on a random Tuesday,

10:08.901 --> 10:11.445
especially when we have a meeting
with Councilmember Saldana today.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.906
I had Nicholas call her.
We're moving it to a Zoom.

10:13.989 --> 10:17.951
A Zo-- I hate Zooms.
I don't get to show off my personality.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.329
How the hell are they
gonna see my sweet side?

10:20.913 --> 10:25.792
Sofia, look at everybody.
They're so excited.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.794
Look, they're taking pictures of my plane.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.882
Don't take this away from them.
It's all gonna work out. Come on.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.427
-Come on.
-Fine.

10:37.513 --> 10:40.057
She's coming. You guys, she's coming!

10:44.436 --> 10:46.605
Welcome to my jet, everyone.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.107
So, this is the main cabin.

10:49.191 --> 10:53.695
You got the bar, the lounge area
and the work space up front.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.030
A love seat on a plane.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.198
Now I have seen everything.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.825
And this is the recliner where I received

10:58.909 --> 11:01.453
an almost too sensual massage
from Julianne Moore.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.957
And this is the chocolate fountain

11:05.040 --> 11:07.084
I ordered special for you guys.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.212
Chocolate-dipped strawberries
on a private plane?

11:10.295 --> 11:14.258
I'm living the American Dream,
being related to a rich person.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.593
-Not too bad, huh?
-I've never seen this…

11:16.677 --> 11:19.721
-You a chocolate fountain fan?
-I'm a fan of strong Wi-Fi.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.140
Does this plane get Internet
so I can keep working?

11:22.224 --> 11:24.601
It sure does.
And you know what else it has?

11:24.685 --> 11:27.563
A hot tub in the back!

11:28.146 --> 11:30.524
And we also have extra swim trunks
for anyone who needs them.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.777
Yes, please.
I love getting in water right after I eat.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.622
Hey, I've always wondered
what those circular things

11:45.706 --> 11:47.291
on the back of the phone are for.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.959
I have no idea.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.170
I really don't. I was gonna ask you.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.338
My daughter put it on.

11:53.422 --> 11:57.009
She said my belt clip
was actively repelling women.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.093
Well, she's not wrong.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.429
If I were you,
I would keep that circle thing hidden,

12:00.512 --> 12:02.764
or else women are gonna be
throwing themselves at you.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.392
Well, so far it has not been a problem.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.189
I actually don't think I'm quite ready
to jump back into the dating scene.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.733
-Yeah, I hear you.
-Can't even remember the

12:12.816 --> 12:13.942
last time I went on a date

12:14.026 --> 12:15.652
with somebody that wasn't my wife.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.238
I feel like it was, like, 1997.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.323
Oh, my God.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.449
Yeah, I remember now,

12:20.532 --> 12:22.618
because I took her
to go see Air Force One.

12:22.701 --> 12:26.288
That's so funny.
I think I saw Air Force One on a date.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.372
-Really?
-Yes.

12:27.456 --> 12:31.543
It's one of my favorites.
"Get off my plane!"

12:31.627 --> 12:33.837
"Get off my plane."

12:35.047 --> 12:36.423
Yours is so much better.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.425
It also works, 'cause this is your plane.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.808
This is the captain speaking.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.519
I apologize for the turbulence.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.646
We are encountering
a little bit of weather.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.648
It's gonna be fine, everyone.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.234
William is the best.
He's flown jets for the Navy.

12:55.317 --> 12:58.946
This kind of thing happens all the time.
It's no big--

12:59.029 --> 13:04.034
Oh, fuck! Oh, shit! Oh, fucking holy shit!

13:04.117 --> 13:07.079
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.040
What are you doing?

13:10.832 --> 13:13.335
If my face gets fucked up,
just cremate the body, okay?

13:13.836 --> 13:16.129
Dude, why are you turned around right now?

13:16.213 --> 13:18.799
-I don't know!
-Did you take your seat belt off?

13:18.882 --> 13:21.134
I panicked. It was a bad instinct!

13:27.558 --> 13:28.809
Oh, my God.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.729
It's okay. It's all right.
Is everybody okay?

13:33.522 --> 13:36.024
Sorry about that.
We've run into a small lightning storm.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.944
They're saying we have to take a pit stop
here in Oklahoma City

13:39.027 --> 13:40.654
and wait for the skies to clear up.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.406
Apologies, once again.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.908
How is that motherfucker so calm?

13:55.210 --> 13:56.587
How long have we been stuck here?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.132
About three hours.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.177
I am so sorry about this, you guys.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.095
What a bummer, right?

14:06.430 --> 14:08.473
But these things do happen.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.726
No, these things don't just happen.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.853
You made it happen.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.188
What, the storm?

14:14.271 --> 14:15.772
No, the whole trip.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.900
We were supposed
to be in a meeting right now,

14:17.983 --> 14:20.652
but because we have no Wi-Fi,
we missed it.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.279
And it's a bad look to explain

14:22.362 --> 14:25.866
that we got on a private jet
to Miami instead of doing our jobs.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.161
I mean, what is so important
about Miami anyways?

14:29.244 --> 14:30.996
It's full of shitty nightclubs
and shittier drugs.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.247
How dare you?

14:33.040 --> 14:36.460
I will not have you bad-mouthing Miami,
or its drugs.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.545
Which are exquisite, by the way.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.006
Can we just tell them, please?

14:41.673 --> 14:42.966
Tell us what?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.886
We were invited to an amazing party

14:45.969 --> 14:47.638
in Miami with all of our friends,

14:47.721 --> 14:51.225
and Molly absolutely deserves to go,
because she's been through a lot.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.602
What she doesn't deserve is judgment

14:53.685 --> 14:55.437
from a bunch of people
who look like they were born

14:55.521 --> 14:57.314
in a Sears clearance rack.

14:58.649 --> 15:01.318
Wow. Bonding retreat, huh?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.987
The party is in addition to the retreat.

15:04.071 --> 15:09.576
It's just a small fragrance launch gala
emceed by Kevin Hart.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.996
This wasn't about you getting to
know us. You wanted to have it both ways.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.874
This is basically
a very luxurious kidnapping.

15:15.958 --> 15:20.254
Okay. Excuse me for trying
to make your lives a little more fun.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.672
I mean, I'm sorry.

15:21.755 --> 15:25.133
But exactly five minutes
to discuss your weekend?

15:25.217 --> 15:26.343
Come on, you guys.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.427
I don't know, cuz.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.847
Sofia might be tough
but at least she tells us the truth.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.890
We always know where we stand.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.601
Which is usually in the corner,
scared of her.

15:34.685 --> 15:35.686
Okay, you know what?

15:35.769 --> 15:38.021
I'm making
an executive decision right now.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.691
I'm going back to LA,
in a regular-ass plane.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.277
Anyone who wants to join,
more than welcome.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.487
Yeah. Molly, this was fun,

15:45.571 --> 15:47.281
but I should probably get back.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.491
I shouldn't have left
without telling my daughter.

15:49.575 --> 15:50.868
Yeah, I'm going too.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.536
I have an appointment with my therapist,

15:52.619 --> 15:56.123
and I got a feeling
we're gonna have a lot to talk about.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.126
Come on, guys, it's just two nights.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.795
I mean,
I really don't get what the big deal is.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.548
You don't get it because your life
is different from everyone else's here.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.924
It's completely frictionless.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.302
Anything you want to happen happens.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.263
Our lives are filled with friction.
We've got shit to do.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.224
You can't just pack us up
and move us around like we're luggage.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.859
If you see Kevin Hart,
will you show him my YouTube channel

16:23.942 --> 16:25.986
where I taste-test cookies
from around the globe?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.071
I will.

17:02.523 --> 17:07.152
True, it's true, it's very true.
Oh, my God, you guys.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.488
I have missed this so much.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.490
So good to be with my girls.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.157
Wait, before I forget.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.911
-I know that the launch party is tomorrow…
-Yes.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.622
…but I wanted
to do a sneak preview for my girls.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.540
Yay!

17:21.625 --> 17:22.626
Here.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.253
-Jacinda.
-One for you. There you go.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.631
-Gorgeous.
-So professional.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.925
I know. It's called "Acquittal."

17:30.008 --> 17:32.010
What? Is that because you
got acquitted at your trial?

17:32.594 --> 17:34.847
Oh, my God.
I didn't even think about that. No.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.600
I just liked the way it sounded.

17:38.684 --> 17:41.103
-That's great.
-Try it.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.357
-Oh, my God.
-I love it so much.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.441
Stop.

17:51.154 --> 17:55.158
Wow. That's something, huh?

17:55.659 --> 17:57.327
It's really-- It really gets you.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.454
In the back of your throat, huh?

18:00.038 --> 18:01.290
What is that?

18:01.373 --> 18:06.044
Yeah, so that is the civet musk,
and it comes from an African wildcat.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.005
-That's what I'm tasting.
-Yes.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.423
I think I'm tasting animal.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.216
I am so proud of you.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.510
-Babe, thank you. Thanks.
-And just--

18:13.594 --> 18:16.180
-Did we all get the same one?
-Yes.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.598
Okay. Can I--

18:20.475 --> 18:22.686
Somehow that's stronger.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.771
It is strong.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.024
I love this bottle.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.192
So elegant.

18:28.859 --> 18:29.860
Gorgeous.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.237
Excuse me? Hi. Excuse me.

18:32.321 --> 18:34.448
Hi. I don't mean to be a bother,

18:34.531 --> 18:37.326
but I wanted this part
of the patio to be private,

18:37.409 --> 18:40.746
and you seated those people, like,
really close to us.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.289
I'm so sorry.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.790
It's about to get really busy here,

18:43.874 --> 18:45.959
and we can't block off
the entire area anymore.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.670
-I'm sorry.
-Okay, well, what about this?

18:48.754 --> 18:50.589
What if I rented out the entire roof?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.383
-Sweetie, you don't have to do that.
-No. No, no.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.761
It's fine. They can eat inside.
It'll be great.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.889
I guess I could go check on that.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.183
Amazing. Thank you so much.

19:02.601 --> 19:04.645
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.439
Such a girl boss move.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.691
Honestly, we deserve it.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.487
The girls
are taking over Miami tonight.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.782
-Refills!
-Me, me, me.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.576
Here, here, here. Oh, God.
That is so good, I could bathe in it.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.662
I could have, like, nine more.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.497
I, like, don't have a tolerance.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.381
Again, I am truly sorry for moving
this meeting around on you so much.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.341
It was not ideal, but I'm here now.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.927
I appreciate you for coming in
to the office, as well.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.096
We all know how LA traffic is no joke.

19:40.973 --> 19:44.309
And also an issue hopefully
we can fix at some point.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.895
Why don't we jump right
into it and talk zoning?

19:46.979 --> 19:49.606
As you know, our dream scenario
is that we could re-zone

19:49.690 --> 19:51.692
this whole section of Alameda Street.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.903
I'm glad you used the term
"dream" first and not me.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.447
Because that's what it is, Ms. Salinas.

19:57.531 --> 19:58.782
A total pipe dream.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.201
We-- It doesn't to have
to be that way, though.

20:01.285 --> 20:05.956
-We'll fight tooth and nail, and--
-Hey, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.791
Ms. Wells,
I didn't expect to see you today.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.294
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.129
I live for zoning.

20:13.172 --> 20:17.467
Now, Councilmember Saldana,
before we talk about your jacket,

20:17.551 --> 20:18.927
which is stunning,

20:19.761 --> 20:23.765
I just wanna say that Sofia here
has my full confidence.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.393
She has been doing
the work here for years,

20:26.476 --> 20:30.439
and she will do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.901
And I'm just here to support her
and supply my resources.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.279
Which are gigantic.

20:37.362 --> 20:41.533
Now, seriously,
tell me where you got that jacket.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.995
-I appreciate you joining us today.
-It's my pleasure.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.747
Sofia, why don't you continue?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.125
Sure, let's carry on.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.794
Alameda Street means so much to us.

21:01.470 --> 21:06.350
So, as you can see,
I ditched the launch party.

21:06.433 --> 21:10.896
Which was a big, big, big sacrifice
for a bunch of ungrateful little normies.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.814
Thank you, Nicholas. It's all right.

21:14.149 --> 21:17.945
What I did was unfair,
and I'm sorry about that.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.740
I actually do wanna get
to know all of you better.

21:21.823 --> 21:26.870
So, today after work,
I will be next door at Lucy's,

21:26.954 --> 21:28.956
and everyone's invited.

21:29.581 --> 21:34.670
I hope you can join me.
And if you can't, I totally get it.

21:34.753 --> 21:38.006
No pressure. There's no kidnapping.

21:40.092 --> 21:41.343
Let's go, Nicholas.

21:56.650 --> 22:01.822
So, do you wanna order another drink,
or do you wanna call it?

22:04.908 --> 22:05.993
Maybe we should go.

22:09.913 --> 22:10.914
Hello.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.251
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.712
-So glad you guys could make it.
-Yeah.

22:17.296 --> 22:18.297
Hi.

22:27.973 --> 22:30.058
I've just always loved service.

22:30.142 --> 22:32.311
I spent the summers volunteering
in Uganda.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.979
I thought about doing Teach for America,

22:34.062 --> 22:36.398
but then I didn't wanna take jobs away
from union teachers.

22:36.481 --> 22:39.026
That is so nice, Ainsley.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.611
It's so inspiring.

22:40.694 --> 22:42.571
Rhonda, how did you get started?

22:43.155 --> 22:44.573
On what, dear?

22:46.617 --> 22:48.035
You know what? You can tell me later.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.746
Sofia, what about you?

22:50.829 --> 22:52.915
When did you know you wanted
to do this job?

22:55.626 --> 22:57.711
-When I was eight.
-Really?

22:58.629 --> 23:00.506
That's crazy. You were just a kid.

23:00.589 --> 23:03.383
Yeah. I was eight years old
when my dad fell and hurt his knee.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.427
He was laid off
'cause he couldn't do the job.

23:06.428 --> 23:10.140
My parents tried bargaining
with the landlord, but nothing worked.

23:10.224 --> 23:12.226
So, one day in January,

23:12.309 --> 23:16.271
we packed all our stuff
and moved it into a storage unit.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.149
That night, we slept in our car.

23:20.526 --> 23:24.029
I mean, eventually, my dad got better
and we got back on our feet,

23:24.112 --> 23:25.864
but I will never forget the feeling I had

23:26.490 --> 23:28.116
the first night sleeping in the back seat.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.913
-Man, that's tough.
-Yeah, it's tough.

23:33.664 --> 23:37.626
But it turned out to be
one of the best days of my life.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.879
Because that was the day I discovered
why I was put on this Earth.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.674
I realized how fragile things were.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.009
And if it could happen to us,
it can happen to anyone.

23:47.386 --> 23:48.387
Even at eight,

23:48.470 --> 23:52.349
I knew I didn't want that happening
to anyone else ever again.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.982
Goddamn, you never told us that.
You're like Batman and shit.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.943
Yeah. The Dark Knight of charity.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.239
I guess I'm kind of like Batman, you know.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.658
Cool as shit and looks good in black.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.330
Thanks for sharing.

24:15.914 --> 24:16.915
Sure.

24:20.586 --> 24:25.674
Hey. I just want to say,
last night in Miami,

24:26.508 --> 24:29.136
I was really close to just saying,
"Fuck it,"

24:29.219 --> 24:30.762
and leaving you alone to do your job.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.265
You can still totally do that if you want.

24:33.348 --> 24:37.686
-I know. But I'm not going to.
-Why not?

24:37.769 --> 24:40.939
Because you guys are having
a really positive effect on me.

24:41.815 --> 24:42.858
Especially you.

24:42.941 --> 24:44.568
I don't have to do that.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.112
It's really beautiful,
the lessons you're teaching me.

24:47.196 --> 24:48.780
-I'm not trying to teach you lessons.
-And yet,

24:48.864 --> 24:52.784
here you are, not even trying,
but still being a wonderful teacher.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.745
That's really not my intention in any way.

24:54.828 --> 24:58.040
-You're an inspiration.
-Okay.

24:59.166 --> 25:02.377
I'll see you tomorrow. And the next day.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.421
And the next day.

25:04.505 --> 25:07.299
Actually, Friday there's a thing
in St. Barts I might wanna go to,

25:07.382 --> 25:08.717
but definitely next week.

25:09.510 --> 25:13.138
And the week after that,
and the week after that.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.308
-I'll see you.
-Okay.
