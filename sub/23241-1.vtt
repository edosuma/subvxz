00:46.048 --> 00:49.251
- [Narrator] Yes, nice
to meet you Mr. Logan.

00:49.251 --> 00:53.025
It looks like you have
been on my radar lately.

00:53.025 --> 00:55.747
I've already been briefed
on your progress here.

00:55.747 --> 00:58.827
I will address our
officials with a pre-speech

00:58.827 --> 01:02.166
and you will show us
what you have discovered.

01:02.166 --> 01:06.166
Remember, this information
is highly classified.

01:07.158 --> 01:08.507
Whatever you show today

01:08.507 --> 01:10.247
will be treated as sensitive material

01:10.247 --> 01:13.747
above top secret material from here on in.

01:17.023 --> 01:19.773
(water dripping)

01:38.581 --> 01:39.603
- [Jennifer] Excuse me, sir,

01:39.603 --> 01:41.435
will you please step out of the car?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.715
Someone reported that there
was a suspicious character

01:43.715 --> 01:46.734
parked on the landing after hours.

01:46.734 --> 01:50.065
So once again, can you
please step outside the car?

01:50.065 --> 01:52.613
Don't make me use deadly force, mister.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.822
Do you have any drugs in your vehicle?

01:54.822 --> 01:56.715
Freeze, freeze!

01:56.715 --> 01:58.574
I'm taking you in for questioning.

01:58.574 --> 02:00.723
I'm booking you for
assault on a police officer

02:00.723 --> 02:03.115
and for carrying a concealed weapon.

02:03.115 --> 02:05.849
By the way my head is still
pounding from hitting my head

02:05.849 --> 02:07.326
off my car.

02:07.326 --> 02:10.536
I was on my way home when
all units received the call.

02:10.536 --> 02:13.147
- [Man] Ladies and gentlemen,

02:13.147 --> 02:16.097
we are making history tonight.

02:16.097 --> 02:19.502
Mr. Logan has successfully
found a new world for us

02:19.502 --> 02:22.002
as human beings to start over.

02:45.939 --> 02:49.082
Yes, nice to meet you Mr. Logan.

02:49.082 --> 02:52.882
It looks like you have
been on my radar lately.

02:52.882 --> 02:55.562
I've already been briefed
on your progress here.

02:55.562 --> 02:58.692
I will address our
officials with a pre-speech

02:58.692 --> 03:02.013
and you will show us
what you have discovered.

03:02.013 --> 03:04.491
Remember, this information.

03:04.491 --> 03:06.741
(coughing)

03:14.623 --> 03:16.831
(beeping)

03:16.831 --> 03:19.414
(upbeat music)

03:26.919 --> 03:29.827
- [Man] Heaven, my new heaven.

03:29.827 --> 03:31.410
Let me see you now.

03:33.568 --> 03:37.735
As you can see, I am alive on
Planet X with no pollution,

03:39.307 --> 03:42.724
no sins, no nuclear weapons, no diseases.

03:43.864 --> 03:44.781
Just peace.

03:49.283 --> 03:51.783
- [Man In Black Shirt] Dammit.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.776
(door slams)

04:02.244 --> 04:04.198
- [Man] Did I do something wrong officer?

04:04.198 --> 04:06.683
(zooming)

04:06.683 --> 04:08.933
(shooting)

04:13.465 --> 04:16.591
- [Man] This looks like an
auto with an MPC silencer.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.111
I have never seen one before.

04:18.111 --> 04:22.555
Only top level facility agents
carry these type of weapons.

04:22.555 --> 04:24.722
(zooming)

04:25.600 --> 04:27.319
- [Jennifer] I read you loud and clear.

04:27.319 --> 04:31.486
Dispatcher 579-37, I am going
into the Circle District.

04:33.092 --> 04:34.452
- [Man] I need you guys to figure out

04:34.452 --> 04:38.923
why do those Portal X agents
want this Logan so bad.

04:38.923 --> 04:40.578
Those guys showed up pretty fast.

04:40.578 --> 04:42.997
A little too fast if you know what I mean.

04:42.997 --> 04:45.124
Something smells fishy
about this whole situation

04:45.124 --> 04:46.568
that went down.

04:46.568 --> 04:48.997
I want you to figure out
what the hell is going on.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.164
I'm too old for this shit.

04:59.117 --> 05:01.700
(gentle music)

05:12.960 --> 05:16.178
Jen, we have all the cars LoJacked

05:16.178 --> 05:18.808
so I can pinpoint your
position at any time.

05:18.808 --> 05:22.298
Remember, do not mess
with Street's property.

05:22.298 --> 05:25.448
He runs the Circle District like his baby.

05:25.448 --> 05:27.448
I heard the government is
trying to handle the problem

05:27.448 --> 05:30.678
but the people that still do
live out there are in control.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.943
- [Jennifer] Yeah, I heard, that's crazy.

05:32.943 --> 05:34.813
I will radio back when I can.

05:34.813 --> 05:37.514
- [Man] So contact me
via radio if you need me.

05:37.514 --> 05:41.035
And remember, Xavier Street
sometimes refers to himself

05:41.035 --> 05:42.480
as the street president.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.420
Why?

05:43.420 --> 05:45.969
Because he knows everything
coming in and out

05:45.969 --> 05:47.702
of his district.

05:47.702 --> 05:51.257
So keep a low profile
in the Circle District,

05:51.257 --> 05:52.923
which makes up all the United States

05:52.923 --> 05:55.419
except for St. Louis City.

05:55.419 --> 05:57.579
At the recession came from the depression

05:57.579 --> 06:00.782
and after depression came the energy wars,

06:00.782 --> 06:02.760
Xavier was a businessman who bought

06:02.760 --> 06:05.677
all the outside boundaries in 2020.

06:07.265 --> 06:08.155
- [Jennifer] What the?

06:08.155 --> 06:10.191
- [Announcer] Welcome
to Eye Candy and Cream.

06:10.191 --> 06:12.432
Fellas, get your money out.

06:12.432 --> 06:15.774
It's time to show these women
what you got in those pockets.

06:15.774 --> 06:18.614
We got the hottest eye candy in town.

06:18.614 --> 06:20.774
Even the most committed married men

06:20.774 --> 06:24.454
can't resist the bodies of
these particular hotties.

06:24.454 --> 06:26.803
Ladies it's time to turn it up.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.277
It's the hot hour.

06:28.277 --> 06:30.584
Let's get it poppin' in here.

06:30.584 --> 06:32.101
- [Jennifer] I work two shifts straight.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.135
I got plenty of time.

06:33.135 --> 06:33.968
And by the way,

06:33.968 --> 06:36.006
you are going to need
a hell of a good lawyer

06:36.006 --> 06:37.977
to get you out of this mess.

06:37.977 --> 06:39.217
- [Michael] I don't need one.

06:39.217 --> 06:41.763
- [Jennifer] Is that so Mr. Big Shot?

06:41.763 --> 06:43.195
Well what were you doing with a gun

06:43.195 --> 06:45.352
shooting up a football game?

06:45.352 --> 06:48.036
- [Michael] I took it
off one of the people

06:48.036 --> 06:49.796
who was trying to kill me.

06:49.796 --> 06:53.295
- [Jennifer] So what, are you
a big lawyer or something?

06:53.295 --> 06:56.695
- [Michael] Nah, I work
for the government.

06:56.695 --> 06:59.445
I'm a scientist and and engineer.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.002
(beeps)

07:02.002 --> 07:04.585
(mellow music)

07:24.320 --> 07:26.763
- [Man] Yes, I read
that part in the report.

07:26.763 --> 07:28.774
The cops had to bust the door down.

07:28.774 --> 07:31.424
He was locked in there six hours straight.

07:31.424 --> 07:32.683
Once the cops opened the door

07:32.683 --> 07:35.046
everything went back to normal.

07:35.046 --> 07:39.851
By the way, after this is
over I want to talk to you

07:39.851 --> 07:42.612
about a couple of things as well.

07:42.612 --> 07:45.612
(suspenseful music)

07:50.651 --> 07:54.144
- [Xavier] Greetings,
welcome to The White House.

07:54.144 --> 07:56.483
Do you like what I've done with the place?

07:56.483 --> 07:59.104
I knew the government
was out of their minds

07:59.104 --> 08:02.242
trying to sell the entire
land of our nation.

08:02.242 --> 08:06.293
So when the opportunity came
along, I had to seize it.

08:06.293 --> 08:10.771
But I'm sure you're here for
more more important reasons

08:10.771 --> 08:15.411
than to hear me talk about
being a tyrant figure.

08:15.411 --> 08:19.123
- [Digital Voice] Documented file 00005,

08:19.123 --> 08:23.290
date, December 24, 3040 A.D.,
to President Scott Cars,

08:25.053 --> 08:28.664
from Adam Steinberg, Secretary of Defense.

08:28.664 --> 08:30.581
Subject, cranium intel.

08:32.361 --> 08:33.898
The documents you're about to read

08:33.898 --> 08:38.485
are regarding an incident from
2020 A.D., regarding Planet X

08:38.485 --> 08:40.650
and involving cranium intel technology

08:40.650 --> 08:44.817
from the former Portal X
facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.462
They used a stero-scopic
vison-orial cranium implant

08:49.462 --> 08:51.242
for a video-audio recording,

08:51.242 --> 08:53.881
feeding information which
was fed back to their systems

08:53.881 --> 08:55.838
in active real-time.

08:55.838 --> 08:59.038
This technology was demolished
after the Portal X facility

08:59.038 --> 09:00.698
was shut down in St. Louis City

09:00.698 --> 09:04.926
following the disappearance
of the 46th president.

09:04.926 --> 09:08.404
Recently, the Pentagon has
received intel to our base

09:08.404 --> 09:10.244
which was printed out to our systems

09:10.244 --> 09:14.116
almost 1,000 years later
to our present time.

09:14.116 --> 09:17.164
This cranium intel is formatted
with with chart angles,

09:17.164 --> 09:20.164
including day, night, and locations.

09:21.017 --> 09:24.444
And was part of some new
hypersonic technology.

09:24.444 --> 09:26.636
Digest the information as a reenactment

09:26.636 --> 09:29.019
from a director's point of view.

09:29.019 --> 09:31.886
The former's president's
cranium intel script technology

09:31.886 --> 09:35.454
has recorded exact movements
from Michael W. Logan,

09:35.454 --> 09:37.585
a U.S. government military engineer

09:37.585 --> 09:40.926
and Portal X facility scientist.

09:40.926 --> 09:45.305
Mr. President, recently we
have received the cranium feed

09:45.305 --> 09:47.363
from Michael Logan's implant,

09:47.363 --> 09:51.094
but coming from a young
boy in St.Louis City.

09:51.094 --> 09:53.412
I have arranged a military
team of our best men

09:53.412 --> 09:55.334
to look into the matter.

09:55.334 --> 09:57.753
Once you have had time to
digest the cranium intel

09:57.753 --> 09:59.123
from Mr. Logan,

09:59.123 --> 10:02.092
please contact me at your
earliest convenience.

10:02.092 --> 10:04.213
Some of the intel from
Michael Logan's cranium

10:04.213 --> 10:06.305
had a few transmission problems,

10:06.305 --> 10:09.033
which is noted in the print feed.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.374
Included a well recorded audio recording

10:11.374 --> 10:13.182
Mr. Logan found himself
while he was still alive.

10:13.182 --> 10:15.265
- [Man] Where's Jennifer?

10:16.848 --> 10:19.527
See if all this training has paid off.

10:19.527 --> 10:22.393
- [Jennifer] I will kill
you if you come any closer.

10:22.393 --> 10:24.015
Don't test me.

10:24.015 --> 10:26.076
- [Man] There's no way back to Earth

10:26.076 --> 10:28.909
for I have the only exit sequence.

10:29.864 --> 10:31.356
- [Jennifer] Make one more step,

10:31.356 --> 10:34.356
I'm telling you right now, get back.

10:35.656 --> 10:38.124
- [Man] We're similar, me and you.

10:38.124 --> 10:40.535
Put the gun down, think
of what we could do.

10:40.535 --> 10:41.884
- [Jennifer] We are nothing alike.

10:41.884 --> 10:43.144
I don't want anything from you.

10:43.144 --> 10:43.977
Get back!

10:43.977 --> 10:46.815
- [Man] What are you
trying to do, Jennifer?

10:46.815 --> 10:48.905
There's no escape, I told you.

10:48.905 --> 10:51.564
Choose your destiny with me.

10:51.564 --> 10:53.303
Come to me.

10:53.303 --> 10:56.284
- [Man] Approaching 2,100
feet below sea level

10:56.284 --> 10:57.743
in five seconds.

10:57.743 --> 11:01.826
Five, four, three, two,
one, destination reached.

11:03.779 --> 11:07.663
- [Xavier] Greetings,
welcome to the White House.

11:07.663 --> 11:10.292
Do you like what I've done with the place?

11:10.292 --> 11:12.714
I knew the government
was out of their minds

11:12.714 --> 11:16.204
trying to sell the entire
land of our nation.

11:16.204 --> 11:19.554
So when the opportunity came
along, I had to seize it.

11:19.554 --> 11:23.612
But I'm sure you're here
for more important reasons

11:23.612 --> 11:27.301
than to hear me talk about
being a tyrant figure.

11:27.301 --> 11:28.134
- [Man] I need your help.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.052
- [Man] You need my help?

11:30.052 --> 11:33.261
Well, I need your help as well.

11:33.261 --> 11:35.514
It must be my lucky day today.

11:35.514 --> 11:38.304
I was able to get all
the information I needed

11:38.304 --> 11:42.034
from various sources within
the Portal X facility

11:42.034 --> 11:45.474
to completely build a portal of my own.

11:45.474 --> 11:47.837
The only thing I was not sure of

11:47.837 --> 11:51.458
was how I was going to
get someone to activate it

11:51.458 --> 11:54.024
by finishing the code for me.

11:54.024 --> 11:57.605
You see, this particular
portal does not need

11:57.605 --> 12:01.713
the hypersonic pad you
require on the other two.

12:01.713 --> 12:04.060
I have constructed a digital pad

12:04.060 --> 12:08.227
that activates and deactivates
this particular portal.

12:10.602 --> 12:11.435
- [Michael] It's a mini.

12:11.435 --> 12:14.819
- [Xavier] I see you still have
a sense of humor, Mr. Logan.

12:14.819 --> 12:18.080
I need you to open the portal for me.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.680
Anyway, if you do so I will let you

12:20.680 --> 12:22.899
and your pretty young thing go free.

12:22.899 --> 12:26.830
A favor for a favor, that's
what I'll do for you.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.467
So what do you think of the third gateway?

12:29.467 --> 12:30.659
- [Jennifer] Michael, don't trust him.

12:30.659 --> 12:31.510
It's a set up.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.190
- [Xavier] Don't speak while I'm speaking!

12:33.190 --> 12:35.516
I do not allow anyone to over-talk me

12:35.516 --> 12:37.710
while in my presence.

12:37.710 --> 12:40.150
Holy mother of God, yes!

12:40.150 --> 12:41.923
The gateway's finally open.

12:41.923 --> 12:43.828
- [Michael] Let's go, we are
going through the portal.

12:43.828 --> 12:45.800
Let's get out of here.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.383
(upbeat music)

12:51.360 --> 12:54.480
- [Xavier] By the way, I
got a big secret to tell you

12:54.480 --> 12:56.246
when we get there.

12:56.246 --> 12:59.697
- [Robotic Voice] Audio
sonic chip implanted.

12:59.697 --> 13:03.097
Cranium intel implantation activated.

13:03.097 --> 13:05.014
Cranium chip implanted.

13:06.548 --> 13:09.215
Intel processing chip implanted.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.715
- [Xavier] We're gonna take over.

13:12.715 --> 13:15.273
- [Robotic Voice] Advantages applied.

13:15.273 --> 13:17.606
Stereo scalp chip implanted.

13:18.604 --> 13:21.364
It defends his armor and gained weapons

13:21.364 --> 13:24.281
and large mid-range semi-automatic.

13:25.385 --> 13:29.552
Welcome Mr. President, subject
Michael Logan is underway.

13:34.004 --> 13:36.672
- [Michael] In the future,

13:36.672 --> 13:39.953
this is what we all could have hoped for.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.453
The future is now.

13:43.444 --> 13:47.065
All those conspiracy theories are over.

13:47.065 --> 13:50.648
- [Man] I wouldn't say
that's exactly true.

13:51.964 --> 13:55.047
I wouldn't say that is entirely true.

13:58.134 --> 14:00.551
Mr. President, how could you?

14:02.134 --> 14:05.967
No one is going to kill
Michael, right Xavier?

14:07.592 --> 14:10.273
I set you up, Mr. Logan.

14:10.273 --> 14:15.072
Matter of fact, I'm going
to send a bomb back to Earth

14:15.072 --> 14:19.671
that will wipe out every
single human being on Earth.

14:19.671 --> 14:23.345
A special biological weapon
that will enter the blood stream

14:23.345 --> 14:27.094
killing any human within 15 seconds.

14:27.094 --> 14:28.964
Why do you thing we erased your memory

14:28.964 --> 14:31.313
and dumped you at a gas station?

14:31.313 --> 14:34.524
So you couldn't stop my final plans.

14:34.524 --> 14:37.633
But I guess you're memory did recover.

14:37.633 --> 14:41.592
Innocent, humans on Earth aren't innocent.

14:41.592 --> 14:43.473
They are sinful.

14:43.473 --> 14:44.951
Don't forget,

14:44.951 --> 14:49.684
even God wanted to kill
all of mankind long ago.

14:49.684 --> 14:53.851
That is why Planet X will
be the new X world order.

14:55.552 --> 14:58.606
I will cleanse Mother
Earth of all its sins

14:58.606 --> 15:02.806
and figure out what I
want to do with it then.

15:02.806 --> 15:04.863
When the stories are
written for this world

15:04.863 --> 15:08.545
down to generations, I will
be known as the real God

15:08.545 --> 15:13.023
who created all life on this
planet from my blood-line.

15:13.023 --> 15:15.606
Oh by the way, before I forget,

15:17.025 --> 15:19.276
it's time for Xavier to get his prize

15:19.276 --> 15:21.776
for bringing me Michael Logan.

15:23.937 --> 15:27.437
Oh yes, I did promise you Earth, didn't I?

15:29.316 --> 15:33.984
Well, I thought you might
like a place better than Earth

15:33.984 --> 15:34.945
to live.

15:34.945 --> 15:37.545
(shooting)

15:37.545 --> 15:38.378
Like hell.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.231
(beeping)

15:53.057 --> 15:56.140
You were reckless and stupid, Xavier.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.646
I always knew that he
wanted to take me down.

16:00.646 --> 16:04.337
I only needed him to convince
you to open the third portal.

16:04.337 --> 16:06.596
But I guess we were a little too late

16:06.596 --> 16:09.446
since he wanted to blow it up.

16:09.446 --> 16:13.613
A man who only cares about
money is no man at all.

16:14.587 --> 16:17.170
(gentle music)

16:20.254 --> 16:24.134
I guess your plans to
kill me after all failed.

16:24.134 --> 16:26.384
(laughing)

16:30.185 --> 16:31.823
Don't touch her.

16:31.823 --> 16:33.073
Get off of her.

16:35.503 --> 16:36.336
No!

16:40.955 --> 16:42.622
Ugg, get up Jennier!

16:43.574 --> 16:45.991
You will love me within time.

16:46.905 --> 16:49.726
I will make sure of that.

16:49.726 --> 16:52.945
Become my wife and bear
the first child ever born

16:52.945 --> 16:53.945
on Planet X.

16:55.857 --> 16:58.857
(suspenseful music)

17:04.275 --> 17:05.192
Stop there!

17:06.473 --> 17:07.744
Stop, there!

17:07.744 --> 17:09.713
State your number.

17:09.713 --> 17:11.963
(shooting)

17:13.194 --> 17:14.028
314546.

17:16.464 --> 17:19.214
(birds chirping)

17:22.406 --> 17:25.573
- [Man] Agent 314546, you may proceed.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.179
- [Man] Yes sir.

17:33.406 --> 17:34.937
(shooting)

17:34.937 --> 17:36.937
Next stop, Desert Drive.

17:38.185 --> 17:40.935
Last stop, final stop, thank you!

17:43.046 --> 17:44.963
I don't have much time.

17:47.497 --> 17:49.664
(zooming)

17:51.034 --> 17:53.993
- [Man] Scanning subject Michel W. Logan,

17:53.993 --> 17:56.493
termination hightest priority.

18:01.965 --> 18:04.715
- [Michael] Who the hell are you?

18:09.937 --> 18:12.885
- [Old Man] Hey, get outta here!

18:12.885 --> 18:13.718
You punk!

18:16.744 --> 18:21.193
You damn fool, you got us
headed towards another train.

18:21.193 --> 18:23.705
And a speeder at that!

18:23.705 --> 18:27.224
The government made those
train indestructible.

18:27.224 --> 18:29.097
We're headed right for it.

18:29.097 --> 18:30.165
Dear God!

18:30.165 --> 18:33.575
(train bell ringing)

18:33.575 --> 18:36.575
Either you must be drunk or too old.

18:37.423 --> 18:40.623
Were you already headed
towards the train old man.

18:40.623 --> 18:43.972
Maybe I should be worried about you.

18:43.972 --> 18:47.722
Agents, holy Jesus, Mary
and Joseph, oh Lord.

18:51.609 --> 18:53.220
I do not want to die.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.970
Oh Lord, save me now.

18:58.009 --> 19:01.529
These agents will get in here in no time.

19:01.529 --> 19:05.780
They are reinforced with
level 10 bomb protection.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.498
But they are too strong.

19:07.498 --> 19:08.689
What are you going to do?

19:08.689 --> 19:12.189
They will kill me along with you, oh Lord.

19:15.576 --> 19:16.409
Shit.

19:23.567 --> 19:25.386
- [Michael] They're on top of the train.

19:25.386 --> 19:29.046
They will find another
way in sooner or later.

19:29.046 --> 19:30.495
- [Old Man] Just shut up, let me think.

19:30.495 --> 19:31.953
(shooting)

19:31.953 --> 19:33.402
- [Michael] You don't have
time to think old man.

19:33.402 --> 19:34.235
Look.

19:34.235 --> 19:35.394
(shooting)

19:35.394 --> 19:36.227
- [Old Man] Look out!

19:36.227 --> 19:38.306
(glass crashing)

19:38.306 --> 19:39.223
Ahhh! Ohhh!

19:41.279 --> 19:42.831
I'm hit!

19:42.831 --> 19:45.892
Don't wait, press the square button,

19:45.892 --> 19:48.482
and pull down that
shaft right next to you.

19:48.482 --> 19:50.649
(buzzing)

19:54.320 --> 19:55.320
Take my gun.

19:56.594 --> 19:59.210
It will help you get a
couple of those bastards.

19:59.210 --> 20:00.343
(buzzing)

20:00.343 --> 20:03.971
I have extra shells in the
storage area to the left.

20:03.971 --> 20:06.982
Whatever you did wrong,
make sure you make it right.

20:06.982 --> 20:08.315
Promise me that.

20:09.162 --> 20:11.372
Take this map to the Circle District.

20:11.372 --> 20:12.622
It should help.

20:14.282 --> 20:18.930
- [Michael] I promise old man,
thank you for saving my life.

20:18.930 --> 20:23.097
I will make sure of it, if
it's the last thing I do.

20:24.383 --> 20:27.050
- [Old Man] Go, get out of here.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.903
- [Michael] What's that
blinking light over there?

20:33.903 --> 20:37.282
- [Man] Our special security
systems are activated.

20:37.282 --> 20:39.766

20:39.766 --> 20:40.599

24:32.751 --> 24:33.918
I got an idea.

24:34.802 --> 24:35.951
I wasn't always a cop.

I used to hot-wire cars

I rest assure we do not
have to look any further.

I thought you were dead.

30:29.478 --> 30:33.645
You're all over the news
for assassinating Xavier.

30:34.687 --> 30:38.418
Well I didn't do that,
he was trying to kill me.

By the way, what a nice
black room you have here.

30:43.628 --> 30:47.795
Are you going to let me in or
are we playing hide and seek?

30:48.868 --> 30:51.908
Yeah, that's the old Michael all right.

30:51.908 --> 30:53.913
Come on to the block.

30:53.913 --> 30:57.120
Yeah, that's the old Michael all right.

31:10.280 --> 31:14.447
Mr. Blaze programed me with
past and present memory data.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.277
- [Michael] Impressive.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.493
Where the hell did you get one of these?

always get the new toys

- [Michael] Yeah, remembering.

31:33.264 --> 31:35.739
You made the kids at the
facility school freak out

31:35.739 --> 31:39.448
when you bought lunch for
all the girls in our class.

31:39.448 --> 31:41.722
Administration thought you
stole money or something.

31:41.722 --> 31:43.627

fixing my father's cars.

31:50.987 --> 31:53.404
Those were the good old days.

get number two agent

31:57.816 --> 31:59.483
in a fighter copter?

32:01.077 --> 32:04.566
- [Man] I bought them from
Xavier, not too long ago.

32:04.566 --> 32:05.856
Matter of fact,

32:05.856 --> 32:10.416
he owes me some missiles for
this little deal as well.

32:10.416 --> 32:13.696
He wanted me to find some
classified blueprints.

32:13.696 --> 32:14.529
I thought if he--

32:14.529 --> 32:16.327
- Oh I miss you so much baby.

32:16.327 --> 32:20.327
I mean, it's been a minute
and we haven't spoken

32:21.533 --> 32:23.146
and I just hope that you are safe

32:23.146 --> 32:27.826
and nothing troubling you
and whoever you're with

32:27.826 --> 32:29.837
that you guys all have each other's back

32:29.837 --> 32:32.744
and you're watching after
each other, you know?

32:32.744 --> 32:34.338
Everyone keeps asking me where you are

32:34.338 --> 32:38.826
and I don't really know
what to say or you know?

32:38.826 --> 32:42.993
I'm not sure so I just tell
them that you're in St. Louie

32:44.786 --> 32:48.185
or St. Louis, where Nelly lives.

32:48.185 --> 32:51.872
You know Nelly, in class the Nelly?

32:51.872 --> 32:53.424
They understand when I say that.

32:53.424 --> 32:56.594
So at least they know
whereabout what state you're in

32:56.594 --> 32:59.844
but where do you go to from here, Mike?

33:01.658 --> 33:03.075
Babe, fill me in.

33:04.172 --> 33:07.172
I, like, don't know what's happening

33:08.642 --> 33:12.901
but all I know is that I miss you so much.

33:12.901 --> 33:15.151
Like I, I miss you so much,

33:18.132 --> 33:22.711
I can't even explain it
without sounding psycho.

33:22.711 --> 33:23.762
(laughing)

33:23.762 --> 33:26.939
I think I'm going crazy without you here.

33:26.939 --> 33:30.272
But yeah baby, I just finished a workout

33:32.493 --> 33:35.021
and it was pretty good.

33:35.021 --> 33:38.065
So Miss Nellie hearing our
winter is getting really good,

33:38.065 --> 33:42.292
actually, but it's gonna
suck if you're not back here

33:42.292 --> 33:45.459
in time to enjoy it with me, you know.

33:49.608 --> 33:51.524
Who am I going to go to beach with,

33:51.524 --> 33:54.524
and road trips on, and you know, so.

33:57.959 --> 34:01.556
I think I'm being dramatic
but all I really want to do

34:01.556 --> 34:05.042
is see your face and hear your voice.

34:05.042 --> 34:08.360
So babe, when you get this message

34:08.360 --> 34:10.527
get back to me ASAP, okay?

34:13.606 --> 34:17.043
I know that you're going
to be busy and stuff,

34:17.043 --> 34:21.210
but please make time baby
cause I'm so lost without you.

34:23.449 --> 34:25.866
I just really miss you, okay?

34:28.829 --> 34:30.661
So get me when you can

34:32.858 --> 34:36.358
and I hope that this message made your day

34:37.360 --> 34:40.110
and I hope you know that I'm here

34:41.960 --> 34:44.228
thinking about you every minute.

34:44.228 --> 34:47.646
Bye, I love you baby and talk soon, okay?

34:49.960 --> 34:52.127
(kissing)

34:56.938 --> 34:59.389
- [Man] I thought if he wanted them so bad

34:59.389 --> 35:01.829
I needed some expensive equipment.

35:01.829 --> 35:04.538
He knew they must have been important,

35:04.538 --> 35:06.890
but I didn't give him this though.

35:06.890 --> 35:10.057
I kept a small piece of the blueprints

35:10.929 --> 35:14.129
where they wired money account
transfers for the government

35:14.129 --> 35:16.260
to an area in Northern Africa,

35:16.260 --> 35:20.885
the details of some gateway
being constructed in Egypt.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.635
- [Man] Another arch?

35:23.705 --> 35:24.686
(crashing)

35:24.686 --> 35:26.385
Another arch?

35:26.385 --> 35:30.945
- [Michael] You mean
another portal in Egypt?

35:30.945 --> 35:32.564
I don't know exactly.

35:32.564 --> 35:35.134
The documents just said it was
delivered by the government

35:35.134 --> 35:38.884
to a secret location
inside an Egyptian pyramid.

35:38.884 --> 35:40.545
It was so top secret

35:40.545 --> 35:43.265
that the government were
treating it like Area 51

35:43.265 --> 35:44.098
or something.

35:44.098 --> 35:46.334
But we got to get there fast.

35:46.334 --> 35:48.294
A friend of mine named
Jennifer is kidnapped

35:48.294 --> 35:49.454
by the President

35:49.454 --> 35:52.116
and he's planning a biological
weapon back to Earth

35:52.116 --> 35:55.084
to destroy all human life on Earth.

35:55.084 --> 35:58.276
He's on Planet X as we speak.

35:58.276 --> 35:59.825
- [Man] Planet X?

35:59.825 --> 36:02.083
There's no such thing, it's a myth.

36:02.083 --> 36:04.934
Everyone knows it doesn't exist.

36:04.934 --> 36:06.844
It's an old scientist's tale.

36:06.844 --> 36:09.841
By the way, who is Jennifer?

36:09.841 --> 36:11.294
- [Michael] I will tell you on the way.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.127
Let's go.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.022
- [Man] So what does this arch do?

36:15.022 --> 36:18.433
And where the hell is Planet X?

36:18.433 --> 36:20.462
- [Michael] Well I figured
out that the Gateway Arch

36:20.462 --> 36:22.484
is really a portal to Planet X,

36:22.484 --> 36:25.317
using this metal hypersonic device

36:26.734 --> 36:29.433
I found in the Mediterranean Sea.

36:29.433 --> 36:33.600
Planet X is in a system not
to far from our solar system.

36:36.993 --> 36:39.160
(tapping)

36:44.341 --> 36:45.174
- [Master Tim] It's not bad.

36:45.174 --> 36:47.341
(tapping)

36:53.217 --> 36:55.753
All right Mr. President,
a real-life situation.

36:55.753 --> 36:58.003
(grunting)

37:17.586 --> 37:19.558
- So basically it's showing
me what I'm physically on.

37:19.558 --> 37:21.347
- Okay, so first kick.

37:21.347 --> 37:25.038
You're gonna use the ball
of your foot, this part.

37:25.038 --> 37:27.527
The knee comes up,
we're gonna go back leg,

37:27.527 --> 37:28.944
come up and push.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.040
- Show me one more time.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.598
- Okay, so you're here, good fight stance.

37:34.598 --> 37:39.087
Knee comes up, push it out,
kind of like it's a lay press.

37:39.087 --> 37:40.920
So you're here, right?

37:42.885 --> 37:45.036
- All right Mr. President.

37:45.036 --> 37:46.897
(grunting)

37:46.897 --> 37:48.444
Good, good.

37:48.444 --> 37:50.694
(grunting)

37:52.207 --> 37:53.040
Good job.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.290
(laughing)

37:56.127 --> 37:56.960
- Alright Mr. President,

37:56.960 --> 37:58.672
we're gonna put together some blocks

37:58.672 --> 38:00.505
and that roundhouse kick.

38:00.505 --> 38:02.075
So you're gonna block hot right,

38:02.075 --> 38:04.418
block hot the left, and left leg around.

38:04.418 --> 38:05.443
Excellent sir.

38:05.443 --> 38:06.465
All right, again.

38:06.465 --> 38:07.563
All right, slow.

38:07.563 --> 38:08.543
(grunting)

38:08.543 --> 38:09.376
Roundhouse kick.

38:09.376 --> 38:11.391
- So when I'm coming
back do I need to keep--

38:11.391 --> 38:14.410
- You can stand on fighting stance.

38:14.410 --> 38:15.243
Left foot back.

38:15.243 --> 38:16.397
- Even traditional guard like that.

38:16.397 --> 38:19.635
- So here, one, two and roundhouse kick.

38:19.635 --> 38:20.468
(grunting)

38:20.468 --> 38:22.559
Excellent, the way you
turned that hip was good.

38:22.559 --> 38:24.449
All right, here we go Mr. President.

38:24.449 --> 38:26.305
(grunting)

38:26.305 --> 38:28.559
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

38:28.559 --> 38:30.472
(grunting)

38:30.472 --> 38:32.308
Now who would expect
that from a president?

38:32.308 --> 38:33.268
(laughing)

38:33.268 --> 38:35.269
(grunting)

38:35.269 --> 38:37.156
Excellent sir, ready?

38:37.156 --> 38:39.417
(grunting)

38:39.417 --> 38:40.996
All right, real-life speed, go!

38:40.996 --> 38:42.272
(grunting)

38:42.272 --> 38:43.664
Excellent sir.

38:43.664 --> 38:45.033
Good job Mr. President.

38:45.033 --> 38:45.930
(grunting)

38:45.930 --> 38:47.097
Excellent.

38:47.097 --> 38:48.748
(grunting)

38:48.748 --> 38:49.881
Looks like he's ready for the tournament.

38:49.881 --> 38:50.970
Sir, do I have to tell you?

38:50.970 --> 38:53.229
(grunting)

38:53.229 --> 38:54.845
And one more, sir.

38:54.845 --> 38:56.489
(grunting)

38:56.489 --> 38:57.497
Excellent.

38:57.497 --> 38:58.534
- Woo!

38:58.534 --> 38:59.367
- [Master Paul] Good job Mr. President.

38:59.367 --> 39:01.009
- [Master Tim] You're sweating now, man.

39:01.009 --> 39:02.769
- Good job Mr. President.

39:02.769 --> 39:03.602
- Thank you.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.939
- Here and back, here and back.

39:05.939 --> 39:07.856
- Here and back.
- yes.

39:10.026 --> 39:12.276
(grunting)

39:18.679 --> 39:19.980
That's good.

39:19.980 --> 39:22.598
Mr. President, I'd like to
thank you again for coming down.

39:22.598 --> 39:24.040
It's really appreciated.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.148
Anytime you'd like to
come back down and train

39:26.148 --> 39:28.502
with myself, Master Tim, and Master Paul,

39:28.502 --> 39:29.793
we'd be much obliged.

39:29.793 --> 39:32.356
- And remember, rule number
one, keep those hands up

39:32.356 --> 39:34.785
and keep those kicks high.

39:34.785 --> 39:36.967
- [Michael] Me and Jennifer
went through another portal

39:36.967 --> 39:38.543
built by Xavier.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.675
He acted like like he was
going to kill the President

39:40.675 --> 39:43.687
but ended up killing
Xavier Street instead.

39:43.687 --> 39:45.287
He kicked me back through the gateway

39:45.287 --> 39:48.047
into the Portal X facility
in St. Louis City.

39:48.047 --> 39:50.025
That's why I'm here now.

39:50.025 --> 39:54.145
The President wants to start
a new world, rinse this one.

39:54.145 --> 39:55.895
He has truly lost it.

39:57.224 --> 40:00.025
He promised Xavier that
he would rule Earth

40:00.025 --> 40:02.703
after he delivers me to him.

40:02.703 --> 40:04.585
To cut a long story short,

40:04.585 --> 40:06.596
I want to let the world know
they could have a chance

40:06.596 --> 40:08.429
to live the discovery.

40:10.474 --> 40:13.087
To cut a long story short,

40:13.087 --> 40:15.076
I wanted to let the world know

40:15.076 --> 40:17.575
they could have a chance
to live this discovery,

40:17.575 --> 40:20.156
to be able to live on Planet X.

40:20.156 --> 40:23.945
The President couldn't believe
it wasn't the Planet Nibru,

40:23.945 --> 40:26.528
which is that I first believed.

40:27.864 --> 40:29.767
Sounds like a real hurry up

40:29.767 --> 40:32.607
and doomsday will be
here before we know it.

40:32.607 --> 40:37.385
Anyway, how did you meet
up with this cop, Jennifer?

40:37.385 --> 40:39.276
Another long story.

40:39.276 --> 40:41.743
She arrested me while I
was sitting in this car

40:41.743 --> 40:44.476
on The Landing in St. Louis.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.784
Her memories was erased

40:46.784 --> 40:50.007
but somehow I ended up coming back.

40:50.007 --> 40:51.767
- [Man] Arrested?

40:51.767 --> 40:53.775
Your mind erased?

40:53.775 --> 40:55.942
Did you hear that Natasha?

40:56.895 --> 40:59.807
Sounds like the President is
really taking this God thing

40:59.807 --> 41:00.865
to his head.

41:00.865 --> 41:02.282
All right X Team.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.028
- [Man] Yes sir.

41:06.785 --> 41:08.636
This is the strongest metal in the world,

41:08.636 --> 41:11.224
resistance eight times the
temperature of the sun.

41:11.224 --> 41:12.722
We have to wait for the lights to blink

41:12.722 --> 41:16.593
in three second time frames,
then it will blink five times.

41:16.593 --> 41:19.743
After the fifth time,
someone has to slide through.

41:19.743 --> 41:20.924
Let's go!

41:20.924 --> 41:23.455
Whoa, look at that van.

41:23.455 --> 41:26.038
(mellow music)

41:29.644 --> 41:30.561
Shhh, look.

41:32.713 --> 41:33.630
Shhh, look.

41:36.823 --> 41:38.844
- [Michael] Where's the portal?

41:38.844 --> 41:41.903
- [Man] I was wondering why
there weren't many agents here.

41:41.903 --> 41:45.943
The President must have
moved it to this location.

41:45.943 --> 41:50.153
Natasha, look back through
those maps that you found

41:50.153 --> 41:51.175
on that agent.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.863
Look and see if you can find something.

41:53.863 --> 41:58.030
Henry, radio the helicopter to
swoop us up a little closer.

41:59.655 --> 42:03.103
Code red, you need distraction now.

42:03.103 --> 42:06.112
Get your ass over here now!

42:06.112 --> 42:08.044
Proceed to rally point two.

42:08.044 --> 42:08.877
DTA ASAP!

42:09.724 --> 42:10.557
Over.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.135
Damage to fuel cell.

42:13.135 --> 42:16.113
Fuel capacity is now down to 15%.

42:16.113 --> 42:18.793
Your five percent reserves
are still remaining.

42:18.793 --> 42:21.335
We need to land fast.

42:21.335 --> 42:22.983
No Natasha, no!

42:22.983 --> 42:24.900
God dammit, stand down.

42:25.743 --> 42:27.076
Stand down, now.

42:29.044 --> 42:30.377
Don't break, on.

42:32.204 --> 42:33.037
Natasha.

42:35.135 --> 42:36.724
No Natasha, no!

42:36.724 --> 42:38.953
God dammit, stand down.

42:38.953 --> 42:40.203
Stand down now.

42:41.073 --> 42:43.215
Don't break up on me soldiers.

42:43.215 --> 42:45.703
We need to land this bird

42:45.703 --> 42:49.870
and figure out what's next
after we repair this bird.

42:50.793 --> 42:53.293
Fuel capacity now on reserves.

42:55.873 --> 42:58.540
(train humming)

43:09.993 --> 43:13.655
- My name Weazel, cause I
can weazel out of anything.

43:13.655 --> 43:15.905
Man you got a lot of nerve.

43:18.135 --> 43:20.718

44:29.113 --> 44:32.753
- [Man] Welcome to our new home, Jennifer.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.561
Guards, leave us.

44:34.561 --> 44:36.061
Jen, you can stay.

44:37.961 --> 44:40.628
- [President] Congrats Jennifer.

44:41.713 --> 44:44.585
So your police training has paid off.

44:44.585 --> 44:47.294
- [Jennifer] I will kill
you if you come any closer.

44:47.294 --> 44:48.873
Don't test me.

44:48.873 --> 44:51.014
- [President] There's
no way back to Earth,

44:51.014 --> 44:54.793
for I have the only access sequence.

44:54.793 --> 44:57.073
- [Jennifer] Make one more
step, I'm telling you,

44:57.073 --> 44:58.740
right now, get back.

45:00.641 --> 45:03.041
- [President] We're similar, me and you.

45:03.041 --> 45:04.734
Put the gun down.

45:04.734 --> 45:05.722
Think about what you're doing.

45:05.722 --> 45:06.854
- [Jennifer] We are nothing alike.

45:06.854 --> 45:08.712
I don't want anything from you, get back!

45:08.712 --> 45:11.713
- [President] What are you
trying to do, Jennifer?

45:11.713 --> 45:13.854
There's no escape I told you.

45:13.854 --> 45:16.494
Choose your destiny with me.

45:16.494 --> 45:17.745
Come to me.

45:17.745 --> 45:20.393
How can you not see my plan?

45:20.393 --> 45:22.883
We will become gods.

45:22.883 --> 45:27.003
I will be known as the
creator of all human life.

45:27.003 --> 45:29.691
You will carry my baby and
I will take care of you,

45:29.691 --> 45:30.524
my queen.

45:32.206 --> 45:35.214
So why are you worried
about the people on Earth?

45:35.214 --> 45:38.342
AIDS has completely taken over.

45:38.342 --> 45:41.882
People have destroyed
our world with pollution

45:41.882 --> 45:43.382
like never before.

45:44.284 --> 45:47.617
So tell me, what or who is worth saving?

45:50.087 --> 45:51.066
- [Jennifer] Worth saving?

45:51.066 --> 45:53.767
The corporations have
done the most damage.

45:53.767 --> 45:57.564
When I was a kid I flew in a
plane and looked over the city.

45:57.564 --> 46:00.796
And it was so clear, so beautiful.

46:00.796 --> 46:03.975
When I grew up 20 years
later I took the same trip

46:03.975 --> 46:05.676
and looked outside the window

46:05.676 --> 46:09.533
and I saw pollution in the air
that I never had seen before.

46:09.533 --> 46:11.626
Usually you would only
see that over major cities

46:11.626 --> 46:14.066
like California or New York City.

46:14.066 --> 46:16.444
Now you see pollution even
over the small cities.

46:16.444 --> 46:18.164
- [President] I like that Jennifer.

46:18.164 --> 46:21.013
Such a heart for mankind.

46:21.013 --> 46:23.513
I wish I had a heart like you.

46:24.684 --> 46:25.851
Do for people.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.117
I used to, when I was.

46:30.095 --> 46:31.678
- [Woman] Hi.
- Hi.

46:32.695 --> 46:34.943
- [President] I like that.

46:34.943 --> 46:36.935
I like that in you Jennifer.

46:36.935 --> 46:39.613
Such a heart for mankind.

46:39.613 --> 46:44.146
I wish I could have a heart
like you do for the people.

46:44.146 --> 46:47.396
I used to when I first got into office.

46:48.517 --> 46:50.350
But now we must begin.

46:56.123 --> 46:58.623
(choir music)

47:16.246 --> 47:17.079
You fools!

47:18.096 --> 47:21.915
I told you to capture her, not kill her!

47:21.915 --> 47:24.707
I will need another woman for the process.

47:24.707 --> 47:25.966
God dammit!

47:25.966 --> 47:28.216
(shooting)

47:29.354 --> 47:31.364
This will happen to you as well

47:31.364 --> 47:34.475
if you do not follow my orders.

47:34.475 --> 47:36.915
I'm going to sleep for a little while.

47:36.915 --> 47:39.532
Do not disturb me until you come back

47:39.532 --> 47:42.267
from Earth with my replacement.

47:42.267 --> 47:45.016
And make sure she's a virgin.

47:45.016 --> 47:46.933
Would you look at that?

47:52.046 --> 47:53.963
Would you look at that?

48:01.547 --> 48:03.797
Come in to my trap, X Team.

48:06.614 --> 48:11.296
Did they really think they can
come and kill me in my world?

48:11.296 --> 48:15.463
This is the second time and
this will be their last.

48:17.336 --> 48:19.586
Come in to my trap, X Team.

48:21.246 --> 48:22.776
- [Man] Not so fast sir.

48:22.776 --> 48:25.654
We've picked up a total of
four unknown moving signals.

48:25.654 --> 48:28.347
Three signals are moving
towards the facility.

48:28.347 --> 48:32.514
The last signal is coming
from inside of the facility.

48:34.478 --> 48:35.513
- [President] What?

48:35.513 --> 48:37.430
Jennifer's still alive?

48:39.696 --> 48:42.434
I will take care of her myself.

48:42.434 --> 48:45.184
Track the rest of the X Team now!

48:47.275 --> 48:48.108
- [Man] Yes sir.

48:48.108 --> 48:51.858
(helicopter blades whirling)

49:15.784 --> 49:18.117
Attention Planet X shoppers,

49:19.078 --> 49:22.047
this is your president speaking.

49:22.047 --> 49:25.369
I am waiting on you, so
if you want to kill me,

49:25.369 --> 49:27.569
you will have to find me first

49:27.569 --> 49:31.449
before I set the detonators on Earth.

49:31.449 --> 49:36.380
You will have the choice between
saving Jennifer or Earth.

49:36.380 --> 49:38.249
The time is ticking.

49:38.249 --> 49:39.166
By the way,

49:42.478 --> 49:43.811
time is ticking.

49:46.020 --> 49:47.687
The time is ticking.

49:48.718 --> 49:52.218
By the way, my X trackers has already made

49:53.956 --> 49:57.123
your friend a nice Picasso on my wall.

49:58.820 --> 50:01.420
How much can I sell this art for?

50:01.420 --> 50:02.580
Hmmm.

50:02.580 --> 50:05.163
(upbeat music)

51:12.042 --> 51:14.675
- [Michael] Stop it right
there, Mr. President.

51:14.675 --> 51:18.675
Put your hands up now and
drop those detonators.

51:20.673 --> 51:23.017
- [President] Michael!

51:23.017 --> 51:24.767
Is that you, Michael?

51:26.114 --> 51:28.947
I am so glad you made it, Michael.

51:31.257 --> 51:33.697
Remember when I told you
you were going to make

51:33.697 --> 51:36.915
the biggest decision of your life?

51:36.915 --> 51:37.832
Choose one.

51:39.046 --> 51:42.265
I will let you go back to Earth, save it,

51:42.265 --> 51:45.932
and give you the sequence
to the detonators.

51:49.726 --> 51:52.143
Michael, is that you Michael?

51:56.154 --> 51:58.571
Michael, is that you Michael?

52:01.017 --> 52:03.850
I am so glad you made it, Michael.

52:05.265 --> 52:09.674
Remember when I told
you were going to make.

52:09.674 --> 52:12.091
Michael, is that you Michael?

52:13.025 --> 52:16.465
I am so glad you made it, Michael.

52:16.465 --> 52:20.105
Remember when I told you you
were going to have to make

52:20.105 --> 52:23.394
the biggest decision of your life.

52:23.394 --> 52:27.561
Choice one, I will let you
go back to Earth saving it

52:29.954 --> 52:33.154
and giving you the
sequence to the detonators

52:33.154 --> 52:36.987
because the bomb is
already on Earth, Michael.

52:37.977 --> 52:42.097
Or choice two, you can
sit here with Jennifer

52:42.097 --> 52:46.264
and watch me destroy all
human life on the planet.

52:47.217 --> 52:49.394
So what will it be?

52:49.394 --> 52:51.477
Save human life or Earth.

52:55.566 --> 52:57.795
So what will it be?

52:57.795 --> 53:00.378
Save human life on Earth world.

53:02.646 --> 53:04.665
So what will it be?

53:04.665 --> 53:08.832
Save human life on Earth or you
saving Jennifer, killing me,

53:10.915 --> 53:13.415
and watch the whole world die?

53:15.994 --> 53:17.161
Come, join us.

53:21.825 --> 53:22.992
Come, join us.

53:27.126 --> 53:31.617
Stand next to Jennifer and
watch history in the making.

53:31.617 --> 53:34.985
I already told Michael what he has to do.

53:34.985 --> 53:39.985
Plus I have implanted my Cranium
Intel chip in your brain.

53:39.985 --> 53:43.366
I been tracking all
your positions, Michael.

53:43.366 --> 53:45.526
So what are you going to do?

53:45.526 --> 53:49.693
Do you really think killing me
is enough to save every life?

53:51.474 --> 53:53.937
So what are you going to do?

53:53.937 --> 53:55.745
Do you really think killing me

53:55.745 --> 53:59.912
is enough to save every
living person on Earth to die?

54:02.395 --> 54:03.806
I don't know.

54:03.806 --> 54:06.326
Michael told me a while back in Africa

54:06.326 --> 54:07.942
that if something like this happened

54:07.942 --> 54:10.324
where someone travels through a protal

54:10.324 --> 54:13.076
without a locked in destination,

54:13.076 --> 54:17.076
they can be bumped back
and forth in time maybe.

54:18.446 --> 54:19.695
I don't know.

54:19.695 --> 54:21.334
I don't know.

54:21.334 --> 54:23.815
Michael told me a while back, in Africa,

54:23.815 --> 54:26.455
that if something like this happened,

54:26.455 --> 54:28.087
where someone travels through a portal

54:28.087 --> 54:30.678
without a locked in destination,

54:30.678 --> 54:34.136
they could be bumped
back or forth into time.

54:34.136 --> 54:36.469
Maybe even to another world.

54:37.318 --> 54:40.401
I guess he was trying to save us all.

54:41.526 --> 54:44.688
I guess he was trying to save us.

54:44.688 --> 54:48.855
I guess he was trying to
save all of us all along.

54:50.016 --> 54:52.349
Maybe even to another world.

54:54.227 --> 54:58.144
I guess he was trying to
save us all all along.

54:59.438 --> 55:00.271
(chimes)

55:00.271 --> 55:02.271
I don't know what to do.
