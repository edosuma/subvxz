where to start.

04:52.896 --> 04:54.137
- I know where to start.

- We had evidence that
the Becks used aircraft

to poison cattle
along the highway 89 corridor

05:00.689 --> 05:02.137

05:02.206 --> 05:03.931
Upon serving a warrant based
on that information,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.137
we discovered additional
evidence of a kidnapping--

05:06.206 --> 05:07.931
- We know all this, Jamie.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.517
- Livestock agents
are bound by law

05:09.586 --> 05:11.551
to intervene in
any active crime.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.689
That duty supersedes

But it doesn't alter the lens.

that the family member

05:39.620 --> 05:41.827

05:50.413 --> 05:53.551

and we don't have a solution.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.103

05:57.862 --> 05:59.689
You leave the blanket
right where it is.

06:02.586 --> 06:04.344
I'll resign as
Livestock Commissioner

06:04.413 --> 06:08.172

for my agents' overreach.

06:08.241 --> 06:11.758
And you, you stop looking.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.068
You let it go.

06:15.137 --> 06:17.896
You talk about militias
and human smuggling

06:17.965 --> 06:19.448

06:19.517 --> 06:23.379
And you leave me
and my family out of it.

06:31.275 --> 06:34.034
- That cleans things up
on my end.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.965

that's where I want it to stay.

06:37.034 --> 06:38.793
- And this keeps

06:56.965 --> 06:59.068

Federal Officials,

John Dutton.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.724
Now, Dutton's office
is under intense scrutiny

07:20.793 --> 07:23.206
for its use of force
in multiple gun battles

07:23.275 --> 07:24.551

of both Beck brothers...

this is gonna work out for him?

07:28.344 --> 07:32.379
- Depends, on whether he's
as smart as I think he is.

He had honor
when most wouldn't.

- I'm saying, maybe he's
not the enemy we think he is.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.103
- When there's
one thing that two men want,

07:51.172 --> 07:54.586
they can either share it
or be enemies.

07:54.655 --> 07:57.034
Are you suggesting we share it?

07:57.103 --> 08:00.137

isn't my job, Chairman.

they're commercial.

our tax liability.

bigger income on the horizon.

than casinos and golf courses.
