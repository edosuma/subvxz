WEBVTT

00:38.890 --> 00:40.357
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

00:47.031 --> 00:47.865
Oh, fuck.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.343
Hurry it up.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.003
Yes?

02:32.036 --> 02:32.670
Sir, we've landed.

02:32.703 --> 02:34.604
Are you we still an all go?

02:34.638 --> 02:35.639
We are a go.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.475
Okay, I was thinking we could.

02:39.944 --> 02:42.445
- Are we on?
- Looks like it.

02:42.479 --> 02:44.015
Is it gonna be this hot the
whole time?

02:44.048 --> 02:45.049
What do you think?

02:46.117 --> 02:47.551
This humidity's gonna
be hell on the computers.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.552
Anybody plan for that?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.087
You don't think this
country has computers?

02:50.121 --> 02:51.388
The guy knows.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.991
The guy, the guy, where is the
guy?

02:54.025 --> 02:57.795
Oh!

02:57.829 --> 02:58.830
Foster team?

02:58.863 --> 02:59.864
Yep.

03:02.834 --> 03:03.835
I'm Jantz.

03:04.769 --> 03:05.670
Okay.

03:05.703 --> 03:07.972
This is Fielding and Kroger.

03:09.539 --> 03:10.540
Your guy?

03:10.574 --> 03:11.976
Not my guy.

03:12.009 --> 03:13.077
- Your name?
- Boller.

03:14.011 --> 03:15.378
Did the gear arrive?

03:15.412 --> 03:16.814
Already at the house.

03:16.848 --> 03:17.849
Fine.

03:27.725 --> 03:29.160
Hand that up.

03:29.193 --> 03:30.627
Would you relax?

03:31.662 --> 03:32.663
Are you kidding me?

03:34.732 --> 03:36.100
Hey, does the AC work, man?

03:38.169 --> 03:40.671
Can you at least open a freaking
window?

03:40.705 --> 03:43.007
Hey, it's great.

03:44.809 --> 03:45.810
Fine.

04:18.709 --> 04:19.710
We get out here.

04:25.615 --> 04:26.616
How much is that?

04:28.953 --> 04:29.887
Smooth.

04:29.921 --> 04:30.922
Keep the change.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.874
Are you shitting me?

04:49.907 --> 04:53.543
We're above a sweatshop,
no AC, not even fans?

04:53.576 --> 04:55.046
- Seriously, the fuck?
- It is was it is.

04:55.079 --> 04:56.080
We got this.

04:58.816 --> 05:00.084
Thank you, Jesus.

05:03.921 --> 05:05.690
Which one of you two is
coming to set up that link?

05:05.723 --> 05:07.624
'Cause I know it isn't him.

05:07.658 --> 05:08.558
It's me.

05:08.591 --> 05:09.694
Grab your gear and let's move.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.461
We've got a two hour drive.

05:13.264 --> 05:16.200
Get set up, we'll
communicate once we're synced.

05:32.850 --> 05:33.718
Go.

05:34.852 --> 05:36.220
OPS team secured.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.022
Tech Jantz on route to Alpha.

05:39.657 --> 05:40.623
Confirmed.

05:47.131 --> 05:48.531
Who are you talking to?

05:50.267 --> 05:52.269
You do know why we're here,
right?

05:52.303 --> 05:53.603
Yeah, yeah.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.273
Sure.

06:17.261 --> 06:20.064
Hey, Leap, toss me up that
hammer.

06:29.774 --> 06:31.842
Leap, Leap, Leap!

06:31.876 --> 06:33.177
Leap!

06:37.381 --> 06:38.182
I'm sorry.

06:38.215 --> 06:39.216
It's fine.

06:48.726 --> 06:50.194
That alarm goes off every day.

06:55.866 --> 06:59.602
Look, I don't wanna be rude,
okay?

06:59.636 --> 07:00.838
It's only a watch.

07:10.815 --> 07:12.316
You can eat with us, if you
like.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.734
Pull up here.

08:01.899 --> 08:02.900
Hello.

08:03.767 --> 08:04.768
Thanks.

08:08.038 --> 08:08.873
Can't believe they've got us
working

08:08.906 --> 08:10.407
on those multi-million dollar
toys,

08:10.441 --> 08:12.109
and they shack us up in this
dump.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.410
Freaking tightwads.

08:13.444 --> 08:15.012
Have connection.

08:19.216 --> 08:20.017
My names?

08:20.050 --> 08:22.286
I'm coding the new combat
program.

08:22.319 --> 08:23.320
Wait, combat?

08:24.255 --> 08:25.122
Not for this exercise.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.824
It's just a nav test.

08:26.857 --> 08:28.092
Right?

08:28.125 --> 08:30.394
You do realize that we work
for a weapons company, right?

08:53.784 --> 08:55.252
The drug runners probably set
this up.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.721
You can tell by the amount of
tracks,

08:57.755 --> 08:59.223
people stepping over it.

08:59.256 --> 09:00.824
The locals know it's here.

09:36.961 --> 09:39.196
Jordan,
stop, stop, stop, Jordan!

09:39.230 --> 09:41.232
- Sorry.
- What the hell?

09:42.433 --> 09:43.434
Watch out.

09:45.970 --> 09:47.271
Oh, goddamn it.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.109
Engine's toast.

09:52.142 --> 09:54.278
This is bullshit, who does this?

09:54.311 --> 09:55.346
Someone that obviously doesn't
want

09:55.379 --> 09:57.114
us to go any further.

09:57.147 --> 09:57.982
Why don't we just grab our
packs

09:58.015 --> 09:59.483
and start walking back the way
we came?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.151
We've been on this
road for like five hours.

10:01.185 --> 10:01.852
We haven't seen any...

10:01.885 --> 10:03.354
No, if this map is correct,

10:03.387 --> 10:05.222
there's a tiny village
around here somewhere.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.157
You guys are sure you have
the map the right way up?

10:07.191 --> 10:08.025
- Jordan!
- What?

10:08.058 --> 10:08.859
Shut up!

10:08.892 --> 10:10.394
Why are you always such a smart
ass?

10:10.427 --> 10:11.328
I'm just trying to bring a
little...

10:11.362 --> 10:13.030
Guys, come on, all right?

10:13.063 --> 10:14.498
I say we just stick to the
map, for what it's worth.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.333
It's already getting
dark, and Jordan's right,

10:16.367 --> 10:17.935
we haven't seen anything for
miles.

10:17.968 --> 10:18.969
- Go.
- Just grab our packs

10:19.003 --> 10:21.805
- and start walking.
- You guys, everyone says

10:21.839 --> 10:23.173
the Golden Triangle is full of
opium,

10:23.207 --> 10:25.175
heroin, pot runners, and
landmines.

10:25.209 --> 10:28.178
Us all being doctors,
they might leave us alone.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.047
You know, I don't think the
landmines

10:30.080 --> 10:31.315
can tell if we're doctors or
not, Dez.

10:31.348 --> 10:33.384
Jordan, shut up!

10:33.417 --> 10:34.918
Hey, I mean, no one
goes into the theater

10:34.952 --> 10:38.055
expecting to get killed or raped
or skint

10:38.088 --> 10:40.291
or blown up or any of
these sort of things!

10:40.324 --> 10:41.292
Hey, if I've got the map,

10:41.325 --> 10:42.192
can you show me if we're
in the Golden Triangle?

10:42.226 --> 10:44.295
You're really starting to
scare me.

10:44.328 --> 10:46.297
You need to relax, okay?

10:46.330 --> 10:48.499
Which way, Angie, Tien?

10:48.532 --> 10:49.199
- This way.
- Over there.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.201
- Oh, fuck.
- Wait a minute.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.336
This is not gonna end well.

10:52.369 --> 10:54.405
- Jordan, just...
- Just chill, okay?

10:54.438 --> 10:56.540
- All right?
- Calm, girlfriend.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.342
All right, if we stick
to these well-worn tracks,

10:58.375 --> 10:59.543
we should be fine.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.812
We should be fine or we will
be fine?

11:02.646 --> 11:03.881
Stick with me, Dez.

11:18.295 --> 11:19.496
Set up here.

11:36.146 --> 11:36.980
Kroger, are you there?

11:37.014 --> 11:37.648
Are you there?

11:37.682 --> 11:39.049
Yo.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.884
Hey, the link is at 75%.

11:40.918 --> 11:42.953
Just pan it left or right a tad.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.623
Perfect, done, lock it off.

11:48.058 --> 11:49.626
Is Fielding set up?

11:49.661 --> 11:50.662
Okay, we're live.

11:50.695 --> 11:51.528
Okay, good.

11:51.562 --> 11:53.130
The drop is in 4.5 hours.

11:53.163 --> 11:54.331
We're gonna head back.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.366
Copy that.

11:58.268 --> 11:59.103
What's that?

11:59.136 --> 12:00.337
It's a backup plan.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.505
Backup plan for what?

12:02.973 --> 12:04.174
Is it up?

12:04.208 --> 12:05.342
- Yeah.
- Good.

12:06.543 --> 12:08.112
Cover it up.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.214
Let's get the hell outta here.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.984
Go.

12:14.017 --> 12:15.953
Connectives are 2-4-3-2-6-7

12:15.986 --> 12:18.055
into our team's cameras and
comms.

12:18.088 --> 12:19.623
Who's this, sir?

12:19.657 --> 12:20.658
CIA.

12:20.692 --> 12:21.693
Oh, shit!

12:21.726 --> 12:26.930
Okay.

12:29.099 --> 12:31.068
Okay, he's in.

12:31.101 --> 12:33.170
I thought this was for
an internal test, sir.

12:33.203 --> 12:34.204
Enough questions.

12:34.238 --> 12:36.573
They're watching closely,
so make it perfect.

12:36.607 --> 12:38.475
Objectives may change, stay
flexible.

12:39.576 --> 12:40.344
Changes?

12:40.377 --> 12:43.080
What the fuck he's talking
about?

12:43.113 --> 12:45.182
Code change?

12:50.387 --> 12:51.689
Jantz.

12:51.723 --> 12:54.591
Do you know anything
about an objective change?

12:54.625 --> 12:55.559
No, who said it?

13:00.732 --> 13:01.666
Keep your fucking
mouth shut,

13:01.699 --> 13:02.700
keep your mouth shut!

13:04.234 --> 13:05.536
Shh, shh, shh.

13:15.479 --> 13:16.480
Fuck!

13:19.516 --> 13:21.552
Who was that, motherfucking drug
runners?

13:25.389 --> 13:28.425
One last time, stay quiet!

13:33.665 --> 13:35.299
Angie, are you
sure this is the right way?

13:35.332 --> 13:37.201
Girl, I told you, I
got this.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.268
Who gave Angie the map?

13:38.302 --> 13:40.170
Yeah, who gave Angie the
map in the first place?

13:40.204 --> 13:42.206
Oh, time out, y'all.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.373
I need a drink.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.408
Yeah, me, too.

13:47.211 --> 13:48.780
Hey, Tien, are your parents
happy

13:48.813 --> 13:51.281
that you're going to a
medical school in Chicago?

13:51.315 --> 13:53.584
I hope so, they're
helping me pay for it.

13:53.617 --> 13:55.653
Well, I don't know how
much you'll learn in Chicago.

13:55.687 --> 13:57.554
Jordan, why are you so mean to
me?

13:57.588 --> 13:59.122
Look, in Tien's defense,

13:59.156 --> 14:01.225
it's actually a pretty good
college.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.125
We did our research and...

14:02.159 --> 14:03.293
Shh, shh!

14:04.461 --> 14:05.730
- Y'all hear that?
- What?

14:20.377 --> 14:21.044
What was that?

14:21.078 --> 14:22.312
I almost fainted with that.

14:22.346 --> 14:23.614
Me, too.

14:23.647 --> 14:25.282
Man up, guys, it was a bunch
of kids.

14:25.315 --> 14:27.351
Yeah, with guns, Jordan.

14:27.384 --> 14:29.386
Hey, actually, I don't feel so
lost now.

14:29.419 --> 14:30.755
Ha, ha, you're so funny.

14:40.765 --> 14:42.132
Cutting it close, guys.

14:42.165 --> 14:43.467
- We set?
- Good to go.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.635
Is my team logged in?

14:45.536 --> 14:46.503
Team?

14:46.537 --> 14:47.337
What team?

14:47.371 --> 14:49.106
CIA, apparently, Foster's
orders.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.542
CIA, this is fucking getting
serious!

14:51.575 --> 14:53.745
Well, we're dropping
a secret team of robots

14:53.778 --> 14:55.713
into a country that we're
not supposed to be in.

14:55.747 --> 14:57.581
It got serious the moment we
start up.

14:59.416 --> 15:00.584
- Fuck.
- Bad habit of knocking.

15:00.617 --> 15:02.419
- Are we connected?
- Yes, cowboy.

15:03.655 --> 15:07.591
Alpha, Quebec, 9-0-0-9 Alpha,
confirmed.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.494
Confirmed, line is secure.

15:10.527 --> 15:12.596
Drop is in 15 minutes.

15:12.629 --> 15:14.164
Establishing links now.

15:14.197 --> 15:16.466
Comms one through four
confirmed.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.169
We should have solid comms
when they're all on the ground.

15:33.785 --> 15:34.752
Got on the wrong one.

15:34.786 --> 15:36.253
Look, a plane!

15:36.286 --> 15:37.220
Help!

15:37.254 --> 15:38.322
Did you say plane?

15:38.355 --> 15:40.257
Angie, there's no way they can
see us.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.235
Four's picking up speed.

15:55.639 --> 15:56.841
Chutes aren't opening all the
way.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.442
- Want me to blow it?
- No!

15:58.475 --> 16:00.344
And let everyone in the
area know that we're here?

16:00.377 --> 16:01.378
We let it go.

16:03.815 --> 16:05.582
Well, it's landed.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.617
Signal's lost.

16:07.685 --> 16:08.585
Major.

16:08.619 --> 16:09.754
Continue with the operation.

16:09.787 --> 16:11.889
No noise until we complete the
objective.

16:14.558 --> 16:15.927
You gotta be shitting me.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.227
We'll let the other
three robots detonate

16:17.260 --> 16:19.296
number four after the operation.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.467
Sending go codes now.

16:55.565 --> 16:58.703
We have solid comms with
One, Two, and Three.

16:58.736 --> 16:59.937
Four is dead.

16:59.971 --> 17:01.304
- Shit!
- What?

17:01.338 --> 17:02.740
Damn engineers!

17:02.774 --> 17:05.910
We told them that the comm
modules weren't sitting tightly.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.310
And if we lose connection
with the modules,

17:07.344 --> 17:08.412
they become free agents.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.981
Meaning you have no control.

17:10.014 --> 17:10.682
Sort of.

17:10.715 --> 17:11.716
No module means that they're...

17:11.749 --> 17:12.850
Dumb terminators.

17:12.884 --> 17:14.719
No module, no objective.

17:14.752 --> 17:16.988
Kroger's terminology is
slightly exaggerated, okay?

17:17.021 --> 17:21.258
Look it, in layman's terms,
they have two brains, okay?

17:21.291 --> 17:24.261
One is the module that caps
their artificial intelligence,

17:24.294 --> 17:26.530
that allows us to communicate
with them.

17:26.563 --> 17:28.632
The module also allows
them to make the best

17:28.666 --> 17:30.001
decisions in the field possible,

17:30.034 --> 17:32.770
whether that be jumping
off a cliff or not,

17:32.804 --> 17:36.007
or when would be the appropriate
time to pull out a gun.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.241
We can set objectives,
we can dictate orders,

17:38.275 --> 17:39.443
we can pretty much get them to
do

17:39.476 --> 17:41.713
whatever it is that we want them
to do,

17:41.746 --> 17:44.548
but, ultimately, they will
decide

17:44.581 --> 17:46.316
the best and most efficient way

17:46.349 --> 17:48.618
of doing what it is
that we want them to do.

17:48.653 --> 17:50.454
So they make their own
decisions?

17:50.487 --> 17:51.656
Yeah, pretty much.

17:51.689 --> 17:55.525
I mean, look it, these robots
have full-blown AI, okay?

17:55.559 --> 17:58.029
So they are way smarter than any
of us.

17:58.062 --> 17:59.797
Without that module connected,

17:59.831 --> 18:01.565
it's not a complete package,
okay?

18:01.598 --> 18:03.968
It's like a person with acute
autism.

18:04.001 --> 18:07.872
Clever as hell but useless
in the real world, okay?

18:07.905 --> 18:10.007
They can walk around aimlessly,

18:10.041 --> 18:11.943
trying to figure out
what the hell they are,

18:11.976 --> 18:13.978
but they're not gonna learn
much in the middle of a jungle.

18:14.011 --> 18:15.713
That's why we've never
let them self-learn,

18:15.747 --> 18:18.049
for obvious reasons, and it's
why

18:18.082 --> 18:19.851
we've kept them off the grid

18:19.884 --> 18:22.352
or connected via satellite, but,
again,

18:22.385 --> 18:23.821
without that module connected,

18:23.855 --> 18:25.489
it's not a complete package.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.323
It's kinda like a...

18:26.356 --> 18:27.357
Zombie terminator.

18:27.390 --> 18:29.359
A zombie terminator.

18:29.392 --> 18:30.494
Can we fix it?

18:30.527 --> 18:35.666
Well, with a highly
technical and acutely autistic

18:35.700 --> 18:39.569
delicate adjustment, I'll do my
best.

18:40.738 --> 18:42.572
And

18:45.843 --> 18:46.677
done.

18:46.711 --> 18:48.045
You think this is a fucking
joke?

18:49.981 --> 18:52.482
You do understand that,
if this mission fails,

18:52.516 --> 18:53.483
and you get caught, you could
end up

18:53.517 --> 18:55.485
in a very nasty jail for
the rest of your lives?

18:55.519 --> 18:56.486
Can you chill out?

18:56.520 --> 18:58.522
All right, I'll put on
my game face for you.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.757
Is that better?

18:59.791 --> 19:01.324
Let's give them a small
navigation test

19:01.358 --> 19:03.627
to see if they're still
calibrated without BR4.

19:04.896 --> 19:07.330
Tell them to rendezvous
at the nav-comm link.

19:07.364 --> 19:08.331
Okay.

19:24.148 --> 19:26.717
Excuse me, do you speak
English?

19:26.751 --> 19:27.985
English?

19:28.019 --> 19:29.020
- No?
- Guys.

19:33.456 --> 19:34.457
Wait.

19:42.033 --> 19:45.036
Hi, do you have a car?

19:49.941 --> 19:50.942
Van broke down.

19:51.943 --> 19:54.611
Needing a boat.

19:56.580 --> 19:57.915
Yeah, can you help us?

19:57.949 --> 19:59.817
We're medical students.

20:01.085 --> 20:02.419
Volunteers?

20:02.452 --> 20:03.087
Oh, immunization.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.055
We help the sick.

20:04.088 --> 20:04.956
Okay, we have money.

20:04.989 --> 20:06.123
- We can...
- Jordan.

20:06.157 --> 20:07.124
Okay, but, listen, just tell
her

20:07.158 --> 20:09.426
that we're willing to
hire a guide or a car

20:09.459 --> 20:10.594
- to get us out of...
- Maybe you should stick

20:10.627 --> 20:11.428
to English.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.664
Yes, you're American, thank
God.

20:13.698 --> 20:15.166
Listen, man, sorry.

20:15.199 --> 20:16.334
We're so lost, okay?

20:16.366 --> 20:19.704
Our van just got spiked by
this crazy booby-trap thing.

20:19.737 --> 20:21.538
Do you have a car or a truck,
maybe?

20:21.571 --> 20:24.075
We'll pay you if you
can get us to the river.

20:24.108 --> 20:25.109
Ah, shit.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.912
Don't talk, do not say a word.

20:27.945 --> 20:29.579
No sudden movements.

20:29.613 --> 20:31.615
Come inside now, now.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.416
You speak English.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.197
Okay, okay, boys, let's take
it easy.

20:46.230 --> 20:47.198
You shut up!

20:47.231 --> 20:48.565
You're not one of us!

20:50.935 --> 20:52.636
Where you guys from?

20:52.670 --> 20:54.138
Why?

20:54.171 --> 20:55.572
Hey!

20:58.042 --> 20:59.176
We came from that direction.

20:59.210 --> 21:00.778
About five hours walk.

21:00.811 --> 21:02.013
Angie, Angie, show him.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.517
You leave now!

21:11.656 --> 21:12.589
Shut up!

21:12.622 --> 21:13.623
You're all gone

21:15.927 --> 21:16.928
or I'll kill you!

21:25.736 --> 21:26.804
Are you okay?

21:39.616 --> 21:41.618
Navigation is completed.

21:41.652 --> 21:44.055
Collate the data, send it
back stateside for review.

21:44.088 --> 21:45.723
Shh.

21:45.756 --> 21:47.024
- Major.
- Load the objective,

21:47.058 --> 21:49.961
and don't let that fat
fuck get under your skin.

21:53.630 --> 21:55.066
New objective, load it.

21:55.099 --> 21:55.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.

21:55.933 --> 21:56.834
I write the code objectives
here.

21:56.867 --> 21:59.070
This isn't mine, where did this
come from?

21:59.103 --> 22:00.537
Your boss, so load it.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.707
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold the
fuck on!

22:02.740 --> 22:04.574
All right, I wanna read it
first.

22:04.607 --> 22:05.710
I'm the lead code writer here.

22:05.743 --> 22:07.778
There could be bugs in it
that could drop them all.

22:07.812 --> 22:09.512
I just wanna check it out first.

22:10.915 --> 22:11.916
30 seconds.

22:13.050 --> 22:14.051
It's not my code.

22:14.085 --> 22:15.820
You're not listening, dude.

22:15.853 --> 22:18.689
All right, it could take weeks
to write code objectives.

22:20.658 --> 22:22.860
Major, the techs wanna check
the code.

22:24.795 --> 22:26.529
Foster, is the code solid?

22:28.032 --> 22:28.733
Let Kroger check it.

22:28.766 --> 22:30.633
Should take him about 15
minutes.

22:31.369 --> 22:32.903
Fielding, please route me
through

22:32.937 --> 22:35.973
- the sandbox emulator, please.
- Got it.

22:36.007 --> 22:37.008
That a boy.

22:39.276 --> 22:40.811
Hey, Four's coming online.

22:42.346 --> 22:43.646
Damage report?

22:43.681 --> 22:44.949
Looks okay, just the comm
module

22:44.982 --> 22:46.951
isn't responding properly.

22:46.984 --> 22:48.686
Okay, so there's eight code
breaks

22:48.719 --> 22:50.021
in this objective.

22:50.755 --> 22:52.555
Probably won't when I start
digging.

22:52.589 --> 22:53.891
How long?

22:53.924 --> 22:55.292
10, 12 hours.

22:55.326 --> 22:56.894
Faster.

22:56.927 --> 22:58.729
I need to crash a minute, man.

22:58.763 --> 23:00.597
I'm still lagging after that
flight.

23:02.767 --> 23:05.136
You fix it now, you sleep
later.

23:05.169 --> 23:06.569
You copy that?

23:14.745 --> 23:18.816
Thank you so much for
letting us into your home.

23:18.849 --> 23:20.650
We promise to be out of your
hair

23:20.684 --> 23:22.253
first thing in the morning.

23:22.286 --> 23:25.222
It's okay, I have some food to
share.

23:25.256 --> 23:26.257
Oh.

23:44.775 --> 23:46.744
Wanna see something cool?

23:46.777 --> 23:49.646
So what special forces were
you with?

23:49.680 --> 23:50.681
The tattoo.

23:53.217 --> 23:54.752
This guy's a Navy SEAL.

23:57.054 --> 23:58.355
Maybe the tattoo's fake.

24:00.391 --> 24:02.093
I think this guy's full of shit.

24:03.694 --> 24:05.628
Maybe if you would've
kept your mouth shut,

24:05.663 --> 24:08.332
like I told you, that
would've gone just fine.

24:08.365 --> 24:11.368
Yeah, well, I think a real
Navy SEAL,

24:11.402 --> 24:14.271
a real SEAl, could've
handled that situation.

24:14.305 --> 24:15.372
- Okay.
- Stop!

24:16.941 --> 24:18.242
I've had enough for one day.

24:19.376 --> 24:20.945
We all have.

24:24.448 --> 24:26.283
Sit down.

24:26.317 --> 24:27.151
Sorry.

24:27.184 --> 24:28.185
Come on, dude.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.822
Sorry.

24:40.998 --> 24:42.066
Objective's solid.

24:44.902 --> 24:47.404
More importantly, where
are my energy sticks?

24:49.106 --> 24:50.207
Are we live?

25:02.386 --> 25:03.687
What is this?

25:03.721 --> 25:05.356
New testing parameters.

25:05.389 --> 25:08.058
Definitely didn't
look like a simulation.

25:08.092 --> 25:10.728
There's some questionable code
in there.

25:14.865 --> 25:15.866
Whoa!

25:16.834 --> 25:18.736
Team will recon first.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.037
The orders to secure and take
over

25:20.070 --> 25:21.672
the site will come from above.

25:26.143 --> 25:31.015
Leap, Leap.

25:38.756 --> 25:40.424
You're up early.

25:40.457 --> 25:41.926
How'd you sleep?

25:41.959 --> 25:42.893
I didn't sleep at all.

25:42.927 --> 25:44.428
You guys ready?

25:44.461 --> 25:45.863
Grab your gear, let's go.

25:47.031 --> 25:48.232
Where's Leap, is he gone?

25:48.999 --> 25:51.135
He should be back soon, I
hope.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.239
All right, guys, we stay.

25:55.272 --> 25:57.274
Leap knows these trails
better than anybody, okay?

25:57.308 --> 25:58.909
It'll save us from
getting a leg blown off.

25:58.943 --> 26:00.377
You're kidding, right?

26:00.411 --> 26:03.113
I'm actually surprised you
guys made it in here alive.

26:11.121 --> 26:13.924
Bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang!

26:13.958 --> 26:15.893
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

28:47.544 --> 28:49.012
You leave now!

28:52.349 --> 28:53.617
We're supposed to meet a boat
here

28:53.650 --> 28:55.018
to take us down the Song-Ma.

28:55.052 --> 28:56.019
Think you can get us there?

28:56.053 --> 28:58.589
No, I'm gonna take you
guys back to your van.

28:58.622 --> 29:00.457
Why, landmines?

29:00.491 --> 29:02.559
Well, the boys outside,
they have plantations

29:02.593 --> 29:03.560
in between here and your boat.

29:03.594 --> 29:05.429
You leave now or you die here!

29:07.097 --> 29:08.966
We need Leap to help
guide us outta here.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.034
He knows this area better than
me.

29:11.068 --> 29:12.236
Leap!

29:12.269 --> 29:13.337
What about an airport?

29:13.370 --> 29:15.939
I saw a plane dropping gear
or something yesterday.

29:45.135 --> 29:46.637
You leave now!

29:46.671 --> 29:48.505
The boy will take you to the
track.

29:52.943 --> 29:55.145
The bots have scanned 12
males, armed,

29:55.179 --> 29:57.682
five unarmed males, 14 unarmed
females,

29:57.715 --> 29:59.650
eight children, all locals.

29:59.684 --> 30:00.517
Activate the team.

30:00.551 --> 30:02.352
I think we need to reconsider
this.

30:05.723 --> 30:07.458
We can't do this.

30:10.461 --> 30:11.462
Seriously, dude?

30:44.361 --> 30:45.329
We gotta get outta here.

30:45.362 --> 30:46.196
Where?

30:46.230 --> 30:47.030
Yeah, where?

30:47.064 --> 30:48.332
They're shooting all around
us!

30:48.365 --> 30:49.366
We go outside, we're dead.

30:49.399 --> 30:50.501
Shh.

30:56.741 --> 30:57.742
How many?

30:57.775 --> 30:59.376
Three.

30:59.409 --> 31:01.178
Who are they?

31:01.211 --> 31:02.412
I don't know.

31:17.628 --> 31:19.096
What are they?

31:20.497 --> 31:21.498
Shit.

31:35.245 --> 31:36.446
Who are they?

31:37.548 --> 31:38.750
I don't know.

31:47.692 --> 31:50.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Fielding, never touch.

31:51.663 --> 31:53.196
No, come back inside!

31:57.035 --> 31:58.002
- What are you doing?
- That's not a heroin runner,

31:58.036 --> 32:00.203
that's a grieving wife
and probably a mother.

32:00.237 --> 32:01.005
She's a witness!

32:01.039 --> 32:01.873
Protecting her home and
family!

32:01.906 --> 32:03.340
You choosing not to follow
orders?

32:03.373 --> 32:07.578
Fuck this, Boller!

32:07.611 --> 32:09.146
Get back online.

32:14.518 --> 32:15.519
It's done.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.797
Do you have a problem
following orders, Fielding?

32:26.798 --> 32:27.799
No.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.669
Just wasn't ready for this.

32:48.753 --> 32:53.658
Okay, got to get inside.

33:20.217 --> 33:21.819
Let's get you guys the hell
outta here.

33:42.674 --> 33:43.741
You okay?

33:43.775 --> 33:44.709
Okay?

33:56.386 --> 33:57.587
Gotta help her.

33:58.656 --> 34:00.725
Yeah, I'll go, I'll go.

34:02.727 --> 34:04.762
Hey, what are you doing?

34:04.796 --> 34:06.463
If you go out there, you're
dead.

34:06.496 --> 34:07.999
Please, don't go.

34:08.032 --> 34:09.633
Be quiet, be quiet.

34:26.984 --> 34:28.653
Oh, shit!

34:28.686 --> 34:31.254
Stay low, stay low, follow me!

34:31.288 --> 34:32.156
Come on!

34:56.346 --> 34:57.715
Dez, get up, get up,
get up!

35:10.862 --> 35:12.063
What do we do?

35:12.096 --> 35:13.296
Stay here.

35:14.899 --> 35:15.867
Where's he going?

35:30.081 --> 35:31.716
Hey!

35:31.749 --> 35:32.750
Over here!

35:35.019 --> 35:36.620
Who the hell is that?

35:36.654 --> 35:37.955
- Abort.
- Stop the team.

35:40.024 --> 35:40.858
We're recording this?

35:40.892 --> 35:41.926
- Yes.
- Rewind.

35:43.895 --> 35:44.929
There!

35:44.962 --> 35:45.963
Zoom up.

35:46.864 --> 35:48.331
Major, are you seeing this?

35:48.365 --> 35:49.566
Hold tight, hold tight.

35:51.568 --> 35:53.570
Who the fuck is this guy?

36:04.048 --> 36:05.415
Fuck!

36:19.596 --> 36:20.597
Hey.

36:21.598 --> 36:22.599
Hey!

36:34.912 --> 36:35.980
It's Mason.

36:37.849 --> 36:38.883
He wants us to run to
him.

36:38.916 --> 36:40.417
Come on, no, stay here.

36:40.450 --> 36:41.518
Stay low, stay low.

36:42.153 --> 36:43.353
Stay, stay.

36:46.791 --> 36:47.758
There's more of them.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.459
Major, we have six more.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.772
You said it was a clean site.

37:03.107 --> 37:04.775
Obviously not.

37:04.809 --> 37:06.643
These people have seen
everything.

37:07.577 --> 37:09.146
Boller, take them all down.

37:09.180 --> 37:10.513
No witnesses.

37:10.547 --> 37:11.615
Confirmed.

37:11.648 --> 37:13.516
Turn the team back on, no
witnesses.

37:13.550 --> 37:14.218
These aren't drug runners!

37:14.252 --> 37:16.519
Those are tourists or something!

37:16.553 --> 37:18.923
Or dug traffickers,
I said turn it back on!

37:21.158 --> 37:22.559
It's either us or them.

37:23.227 --> 37:24.461
I vote us.

37:27.597 --> 37:29.432
Keala, come on, Keala!

37:31.669 --> 37:34.071
Get that guy, turn them
around, eliminate the witnesses!

37:34.105 --> 37:35.273
Can't!

37:35.306 --> 37:36.307
The team's priority is to
eliminate the highest threat.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.441
And that dude shooting
is the highest threat.

37:38.475 --> 37:39.710
Can we change the objectives?

37:39.744 --> 37:41.846
No, we only have face scans
of the big guy, no one else's.

37:41.879 --> 37:42.646
And?

37:42.680 --> 37:44.015
We need face scans of
everyone!

37:44.048 --> 37:46.549
Otherwise, we code to allow them

37:46.583 --> 37:48.185
to shoot anything and anyone.

37:48.219 --> 37:49.053
We do that.

37:49.086 --> 37:49.921
We can't do this!

37:49.954 --> 37:51.689
- She's right...
- Do it!

38:33.563 --> 38:34.799
Fuck!

38:34.832 --> 38:35.632
Mason.

38:35.666 --> 38:36.499
Fuck!

38:36.533 --> 38:37.368
Mason.

38:37.401 --> 38:39.270
Fuck, I couldn't fucking save
them!

38:39.303 --> 38:40.171
Fuck!

38:40.204 --> 38:41.571
Goddamn it, come on.

38:41.604 --> 38:43.240
This guy isn't a tourist,
Major.

38:43.274 --> 38:44.809
Do we have an ID on him yet?

38:45.910 --> 38:47.011
Sending you a packet.

38:48.779 --> 38:49.780
A SEAL.

38:50.314 --> 38:52.083
Is he a deserter or one of us?

38:52.116 --> 38:53.117
I'll make a call.

38:58.856 --> 38:59.991
Special forces, huh?

39:00.858 --> 39:01.926
If this guy is a deserter,

39:01.959 --> 39:03.995
it could be the ultimate field
test.

39:04.028 --> 39:05.896
Yeah, I was thinking the same
thing.

39:10.101 --> 39:12.269
Mason is priority number one.

39:12.303 --> 39:14.705
Terminate all witnesses.

39:14.739 --> 39:16.874
Mason is top priority target
number one.

39:18.142 --> 39:20.011
And terminate the group that's
with him.

39:20.044 --> 39:21.045
Make it happen.

39:24.982 --> 39:25.983
30 seconds.

39:35.993 --> 39:36.994
Fuck!

39:40.664 --> 39:41.531
Come on.

39:55.012 --> 39:55.846
Where are the others?

39:55.880 --> 39:56.881
We're here.

40:01.052 --> 40:02.319
We lost Bao and the girls.

40:02.353 --> 40:03.187
Have you seen them?

40:03.220 --> 40:04.055
No.

40:04.088 --> 40:05.189
Did you see my son?

40:05.222 --> 40:06.190
He went too fast.

40:06.223 --> 40:08.893
He took off into the trees.

40:08.926 --> 40:13.330
Hey, Keala, Keala, Leap
is fine, I promise, okay?

40:13.364 --> 40:14.732
He's fine.

40:14.765 --> 40:15.433
We'll find him, okay?

40:15.466 --> 40:17.168
You need to lead us outta here.

40:17.201 --> 40:18.202
You know the way, okay?

40:18.235 --> 40:20.104
Let's go, we gotta go now.

40:20.137 --> 40:21.205
Let's go, I'll stay behind

40:21.238 --> 40:22.973
and keep an eye out, okay?

40:23.007 --> 40:23.974
Go, go, go.

42:26.230 --> 42:28.999
Someone's gonna live
to tell what happened.

42:29.033 --> 42:30.434
And what'd they see?

42:30.467 --> 42:32.169
Four men wearing armor?

42:32.203 --> 42:35.172
We were here for surveillance
field testing, not killing!

42:38.309 --> 42:40.144
You highly paid geniuses are
building

42:40.177 --> 42:43.214
weapons of war, no?

42:44.782 --> 42:46.250
And yet when those
weapons are actually used,

42:46.283 --> 42:48.819
you throw your fucking
hands up all righteous,

42:48.852 --> 42:51.255
like you have no idea what's
going on.

42:51.288 --> 42:52.289
But you do.

42:53.057 --> 42:54.391
You knew exactly what you were
building

42:54.425 --> 42:55.993
the second you took this job.

42:56.961 --> 42:59.430
So, before you fucking judge me,

42:59.463 --> 43:03.400
remember, everyone
involved with these things,

43:03.434 --> 43:04.335
everyone all the way down to the
guy

43:04.368 --> 43:07.871
who drops off the donuts, is
accountable.

43:12.276 --> 43:16.981
And you three are at the top of
that line.

43:21.919 --> 43:22.886
Yes, Major?

43:26.290 --> 43:27.091
Oh, shit!

43:27.124 --> 43:28.859
BR2 just shot one.

43:28.892 --> 43:30.227
- Oh my God.
- No.

43:32.029 --> 43:33.163
Shit, shit, shit.

43:39.970 --> 43:40.971
Oh, fuck.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.215
She's still alive.

43:55.919 --> 43:56.954
Hurry it up.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.361
Stop, please.

44:05.462 --> 44:07.298
What the fuck's it doing?

44:08.866 --> 44:09.600
Please, please.

44:09.633 --> 44:11.135
Please, please.

44:19.043 --> 44:22.446
Here she is, she's a doctor.

44:22.479 --> 44:23.280
They're all doctors.

44:23.314 --> 44:26.016
They're here on a good cause
mission.

44:26.050 --> 44:27.017
She's not a drug runner,

44:27.051 --> 44:28.152
she's a.

44:32.389 --> 44:33.590
Fuck.

44:33.624 --> 44:36.860
Oh my God!

44:36.894 --> 44:37.861
Ah, shit.

44:38.929 --> 44:40.264
Calm down, calm down.

44:40.297 --> 44:43.233
If this mission goes fucking
south, we're all dead.

44:43.267 --> 44:44.535
- Seriously?
- We're all dead.

44:44.568 --> 44:45.436
Come on, man, okay?

44:45.469 --> 44:48.105
You're scaring her, you're
scaring me.

44:48.138 --> 44:49.406
I'm scared.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.542
Hey, hey, we are the
brains trust behind this.

44:51.575 --> 44:52.609
They need us.

44:53.977 --> 44:56.213
Everyone's expendable, big
boy,

44:56.246 --> 44:58.148
even you three geniuses.

45:15.366 --> 45:16.367
Hey.

45:28.379 --> 45:30.914
Wendy and Angie and Bao are
still out there somewhere.

45:32.583 --> 45:33.484
We gotta find them.

45:33.517 --> 45:34.651
No, man, they're dead.

45:34.686 --> 45:36.053
Don't say that!

45:36.086 --> 45:37.221
We haven't heard gunshots in a
while.

45:37.254 --> 45:39.189
Maybe they're just right behind
us.

45:39.223 --> 45:41.392
- Angie, Wendy!
- Hey, shh!

45:41.425 --> 45:43.127
Shh, hey!

45:43.160 --> 45:46.063
We can make it out of here,
okay, if you keep quiet.

45:46.997 --> 45:50.067
The greater distance we put
between us and these things,

45:50.100 --> 45:52.202
the better chances we have.

45:52.236 --> 45:53.237
Mason, your hand.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.174
We gotta fix this.

46:07.084 --> 46:08.552
BR2's got a lock on something.

46:39.049 --> 46:40.117
That's Bao!

46:41.452 --> 46:43.387
Hey, hey, hold on!

46:43.420 --> 46:45.622
You go out there, we're all
dead.

46:45.657 --> 46:47.357
I gotta go, let me go.

46:47.391 --> 46:48.459
Stop.

48:25.222 --> 48:25.857
It's Four.

48:25.890 --> 48:26.791
Is he connected?

48:26.824 --> 48:28.158
Bluetooth auto-login.

48:28.191 --> 48:29.359
How's he doing that?

48:29.393 --> 48:31.528
Welcome to the future,
man, it's automatic.

48:31.562 --> 48:33.564
These things can connect
to almost anything.

48:33.597 --> 48:34.666
Four's comm module isn't
pinging us.

48:34.699 --> 48:39.136
It's either screwed or
fallen out during the crash.

48:41.873 --> 48:43.140
What the hell?

48:43.875 --> 48:45.342
Stopping all the commands.

48:45.375 --> 48:46.778
Here, I'll send it a bug.

48:48.378 --> 48:50.581
This will knock it on its ass.

48:50.614 --> 48:52.316
What the?

48:52.349 --> 48:53.584
Do you think it's talking to us?

48:53.617 --> 48:55.452
Is the link being hacked?

48:55.485 --> 48:56.620
No.

48:56.654 --> 48:58.790
What if the cap on the AI
was fried during the fall?

48:58.823 --> 48:59.824
And?

49:01.625 --> 49:03.360
Run Four's system's files.

49:07.197 --> 49:08.265
- Oh, shit.
- Someone needs to start

49:08.298 --> 49:09.667
talking to me.

49:09.701 --> 49:10.802
He's downloading our files.

49:10.835 --> 49:11.769
Well, stop it!

49:11.803 --> 49:12.636
Denied!

49:12.670 --> 49:13.671
It's trying to figure out what
it is.

49:13.705 --> 49:15.272
Is this a problem?

49:15.305 --> 49:16.506
It should already have this
detail.

49:16.540 --> 49:18.843
I think it's just trying to
reboot itself.

49:18.876 --> 49:19.844
Download complete.

49:19.877 --> 49:22.747
Terminate BR4 before
we lose the advantage.

49:22.780 --> 49:23.781
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

49:23.815 --> 49:24.882
We're working on it right now.

49:24.916 --> 49:26.516
The data that I'm getting
from it makes no sense.

49:26.550 --> 49:28.518
Who can send that
self-destruct code?

49:33.290 --> 49:34.224
He stopped it.

49:34.257 --> 49:34.892
How?

49:34.926 --> 49:36.226
He's becoming self-aware.

49:36.259 --> 49:37.095
That's not good.

49:37.127 --> 49:38.096
What's with the 30 second
countdown?

49:38.128 --> 49:40.497
It's a fusion device,
a three chemical mix.

49:40.530 --> 49:42.165
It takes 20 to 30 seconds to
combine

49:42.199 --> 49:43.200
before it can detonate.

49:43.233 --> 49:44.468
Burns at 100,000 degrees,

49:44.501 --> 49:45.937
and a blast radius of over 200
yards.

49:45.970 --> 49:46.771
I'm not sure blowing it up

49:46.804 --> 49:48.171
where it's locate dis a good
idea.

49:48.205 --> 49:49.841
Look what it's standing next to.

49:49.874 --> 49:50.708
The link.

49:50.742 --> 49:51.843
You blow Four, you lose the
others.

49:51.876 --> 49:53.543
Shit!

49:53.577 --> 49:55.512
Okay, is Four dangerous?

49:55.545 --> 49:58.315
No, not in its current state.

49:58.348 --> 49:59.182
Oh my God.

49:59.216 --> 50:00.584
- What now?
- Okay.

50:00.617 --> 50:01.853
It's loading itself to our
servers.

50:01.886 --> 50:02.887
Now it's dangerous.

50:02.920 --> 50:03.721
Cutting the connection.

50:03.755 --> 50:04.922
I want that link terminated
now!

50:04.956 --> 50:05.857
We'll lose the others.

50:05.890 --> 50:06.958
He's loading fast.

50:06.991 --> 50:08.425
I said terminate!

50:08.458 --> 50:09.459
Fuck it.

50:10.394 --> 50:11.729
Just hit, what the?

50:19.236 --> 50:21.338
Nice work, cowboy.

50:21.371 --> 50:22.707
How much of it loaded up?

50:22.740 --> 50:25.409
About 90% before you got all
excited.

50:25.442 --> 50:27.845
How long before you get
it back up and running?

50:27.879 --> 50:29.747
Depends on how much damage you
did.

50:31.683 --> 50:32.684
Fix it.

50:35.552 --> 50:37.655
Fuck, shit!

50:37.689 --> 50:38.690
Fuck!

50:57.675 --> 50:59.911
I got Foster on the
line, put us on speaker.

51:03.848 --> 51:06.616
We cannot let BR4 find a
way to connect, gentlemen.

51:06.650 --> 51:08.485
Now, where did it upload its
data to?

51:08.518 --> 51:09.687
All the cables were just
pulled out.

51:09.721 --> 51:11.354
We have no idea just yet.

51:11.388 --> 51:12.857
Make it a priority, find out.

51:12.890 --> 51:15.492
He's learning really fast,
sir.

51:15.525 --> 51:18.428
I think his AI is uncapped.

51:23.533 --> 51:25.002
Keep an eye on it.

51:25.036 --> 51:27.004
We can monitor Four
through the BFA feeds

51:27.038 --> 51:28.906
if the others are close enough.

51:28.940 --> 51:31.408
Okay, so how are you gonna
bring it under control?

51:31.441 --> 51:32.844
We have to take it down
somehow.

51:32.877 --> 51:34.812
It shut down its self-destruct
sequence.

51:34.846 --> 51:35.880
What about the other BR units?

51:35.913 --> 51:37.514
Can any of them shut down BR4?

51:38.448 --> 51:40.283
The others can take him out.

51:40.317 --> 51:41.651
I can write a new objective.

51:42.652 --> 51:43.688
BR1 can still hunt the others

51:43.721 --> 51:46.791
while Two and Three are
tasked with capturing BR4.

51:47.959 --> 51:49.060
Do it.

51:49.093 --> 51:50.260
On it.

53:40.137 --> 53:41.504
It was a mine.

53:41.538 --> 53:43.674
- What if that was Angie?
- Or Mason?

54:02.559 --> 54:04.161
- Oh, fuck!
- Let's go.

54:04.195 --> 54:05.763
Let's go now, hurry,
come on, let's go, now.

54:05.796 --> 54:07.564
Come on, Keala, come on.

54:07.597 --> 54:08.632
Let's go, hurry, hurry.

54:08.666 --> 54:10.433
Everybody follow Keala, okay?

54:10.467 --> 54:11.468
Let's go.

54:24.181 --> 54:25.448
What is that smell?

54:26.684 --> 54:28.152
It's ammonia.

54:28.185 --> 54:30.688
They mix it with the opium
as they boil it down.

54:37.527 --> 54:38.495
Get down, get down!

54:41.564 --> 54:43.000
Leap, Leap!

54:43.034 --> 54:44.201
Wendy, Wendy!

54:44.235 --> 54:46.971
- Wendy!
- Oh, God!

54:47.004 --> 54:48.806
Leap, Leap!

54:50.107 --> 54:53.510
I thought you were all dead.

55:02.153 --> 55:03.921
Where's Angie?

55:03.955 --> 55:05.890
We haven't seen her.

55:05.923 --> 55:06.924
And Bao?

55:12.129 --> 55:14.065
Run!

55:41.926 --> 55:43.060
Dez!

55:59.143 --> 56:00.543
Can you hear me?

56:12.289 --> 56:13.891
The kid has the module!

56:13.924 --> 56:15.026
I'm guessing that's Number
Four's.

56:15.059 --> 56:16.060
Shit!

56:23.768 --> 56:24.769
No!

56:30.975 --> 56:31.809
Come on!

56:31.842 --> 56:34.011
Yeah, you're welcome!

56:34.045 --> 56:35.346
Come on!

57:42.847 --> 57:44.215
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

57:44.248 --> 57:45.983
Start priming the
self-destruct.

57:47.685 --> 57:49.220
Blow it, blow it, come on!

57:49.253 --> 57:50.754
- 30 seconds.
- Fuck!

57:50.788 --> 57:51.889
Seriously?

58:12.376 --> 58:13.210
And?

58:13.244 --> 58:14.011
Detonation confirmed.

58:14.044 --> 58:15.112
How do we know we got
everyone?

58:15.146 --> 58:17.448
It should've wiped out
everything within 200 yards.

58:17.481 --> 58:20.451
Until I see bodies, no one is
dead.

59:09.300 --> 59:10.134
Leap.

59:11.402 --> 59:12.403
Leap.

59:19.410 --> 59:20.811
Keala, Keala.

59:21.680 --> 59:25.482
Hey, hey, let me see,
let me see, let me see.

59:30.487 --> 59:31.488
Help!

59:32.323 --> 59:34.058
Keala needs help!

59:34.091 --> 59:35.960
I got it, got it, got it.

59:35.993 --> 59:37.528
Hey, hey, stay with me.

59:45.369 --> 59:47.071
What happened?

59:47.104 --> 59:49.473
Move your hand, move your hand.

59:49.506 --> 59:50.507
Oh my God.

59:51.542 --> 59:53.143
Oh, shit.

59:53.177 --> 59:54.378
We need to move her on her
side.

59:54.411 --> 59:56.146
Come on, Mason, help me.

59:56.180 --> 59:57.481
Move her on her side.

59:59.016 --> 1:00:00.351
Need to position her here.

1:00:00.384 --> 1:00:01.952
Okay, put pressure on the back.

1:00:01.986 --> 1:00:04.021
Okay, come on, put your hand
here, okay.

1:00:04.054 --> 1:00:05.556
The bullet's gone through.

1:00:05.589 --> 1:00:09.026
We don't have a lot of
equipment for a wound like this.

1:00:09.059 --> 1:00:11.428
We're gonna try and stop
the bleeding, but, uh.

1:00:12.429 --> 1:00:13.430
But what?

1:00:15.065 --> 1:00:16.233
It's not looking good.

1:00:20.371 --> 1:00:22.806
Keala, we're gonna try to
get you outta here, okay?

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:24.441
Put your hand here.

1:00:25.609 --> 1:00:27.011
Dez, Dez.

1:00:27.044 --> 1:00:28.045
Can you hear me?

1:00:28.846 --> 1:00:30.147
Dez!

1:00:37.955 --> 1:00:39.089
Leap!

1:00:47.998 --> 1:00:49.466
Your father was a brave man.

1:01:06.650 --> 1:01:08.485
I respect any man

1:01:08.519 --> 1:01:09.920
who would die protecting his
family.

1:01:09.953 --> 1:01:12.056
He was fighting for
you and your mom, okay?

1:01:14.291 --> 1:01:15.326
It's my fault.

1:01:15.359 --> 1:01:19.063
I made the metal man angry.

1:01:19.096 --> 1:01:20.230
I stole this.

1:01:26.036 --> 1:01:28.105
Leap, Leap, look at me.

1:01:28.906 --> 1:01:31.175
This is not because of you,
okay?

1:01:31.208 --> 1:01:34.978
Some men sent these metal men
here to attack our village.

1:01:35.012 --> 1:01:35.979
It's not because of anything

1:01:36.013 --> 1:01:37.648
that you did or because of this.

1:01:46.924 --> 1:01:48.892
Let's go on one, two, three.

1:02:00.371 --> 1:02:02.239
Keala, can you walk?

1:02:03.708 --> 1:02:05.342
Yes, slowly.

1:02:05.376 --> 1:02:06.510
- I can help her.
- Leap, Leap.

1:02:06.543 --> 1:02:09.980
Leap.

1:02:22.059 --> 1:02:23.293
Leap!

1:02:30.267 --> 1:02:31.235
Leap!

1:02:42.980 --> 1:02:43.981
Leap.

1:02:44.615 --> 1:02:45.683
Leap, listen.

1:02:46.684 --> 1:02:49.386
We gotta get your mother
outta here now, okay?

1:02:49.420 --> 1:02:52.724
We need you, you're the
only one who knows the way.

1:02:52.757 --> 1:02:54.391
I need your help, okay?

1:03:08.505 --> 1:03:09.573
Leap, Leap.

1:03:35.098 --> 1:03:36.300
Go.

1:03:36.333 --> 1:03:37.201
Major, this has gone south.

1:03:37.234 --> 1:03:38.670
We have to start making some
decisions.

1:03:38.703 --> 1:03:40.337
We have a robot wondering the
jungle

1:03:40.370 --> 1:03:42.606
looking for the fucking
Internet.

1:03:42.639 --> 1:03:43.974
Just stay calm.

1:03:45.542 --> 1:03:47.712
American citizens,
who can still be alive,

1:03:47.745 --> 1:03:51.181
who quite possibly have both
physical and video evidence.

1:03:51.215 --> 1:03:52.416
I don't have enough assets in
the field

1:03:52.449 --> 1:03:54.084
to solve both problems.

1:03:55.352 --> 1:03:57.421
I recommend you call in drone
support,

1:03:57.454 --> 1:03:59.657
we wipe this area clean.

1:03:59.691 --> 1:04:02.159
Listen, this op is off the
grid.

1:04:02.192 --> 1:04:04.194
If I start making calls for
drone support,

1:04:04.228 --> 1:04:06.396
we're gonna have a lot
bigger problems to deal with.

1:04:06.430 --> 1:04:08.031
We have their
positions.

1:04:08.065 --> 1:04:09.801
I'll call you right back.

1:04:09.834 --> 1:04:11.502
We tracked the BR1 to the
site.

1:04:11.535 --> 1:04:12.369
BR2 is en route.

1:04:12.402 --> 1:04:15.439
That kid had a module in his
hand.

1:04:15.472 --> 1:04:16.573
Does it have a GPS beacon?

1:04:16.607 --> 1:04:17.508
It does.

1:04:17.541 --> 1:04:19.109
Then why haven't we been
tracking that?

1:04:19.142 --> 1:04:20.344
Well, we didn't know the kid
had it!

1:04:20.377 --> 1:04:21.512
We've been using the GPS tracker

1:04:21.545 --> 1:04:23.280
built into the BR4 unit.

1:04:23.313 --> 1:04:25.048
We thought that the module
was still attached to the BR4

1:04:25.082 --> 1:04:26.617
so we just never thought
of that as an option.

1:04:26.650 --> 1:04:28.252
So it just never came to mind.

1:04:29.286 --> 1:04:30.521
Fucking amateurs.

1:04:35.158 --> 1:04:36.527
Look, the whole point of this
exercise

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:38.696
was to see how reliable your
assets are

1:04:38.730 --> 1:04:40.564
in a real life situation.

1:04:40.597 --> 1:04:42.165
Now I've got people on
both sides of the fence

1:04:42.199 --> 1:04:43.400
looking in on this, and, so far,

1:04:43.433 --> 1:04:46.370
all we have is an unarmed Navy
SEAL

1:04:46.403 --> 1:04:48.472
beating the shit out of one
of them with a sledgehammer!

1:04:48.505 --> 1:04:50.842
That sledgehammer didn't stop
our asset.

1:04:50.875 --> 1:04:52.777
A very large explosive booby
trap did,

1:04:52.810 --> 1:04:54.344
set up by a highly trained Navy
SEAL

1:04:54.378 --> 1:04:56.246
who shouldn't have been there.

1:04:56.280 --> 1:04:57.581
Your man killed it when he
detonated

1:04:57.614 --> 1:04:59.249
that asset without authority.

1:04:59.984 --> 1:05:02.854
Not to mention, your intel
on the site was incorrect.

1:05:02.887 --> 1:05:04.856
Having seven US civilians in the
zone

1:05:04.889 --> 1:05:07.224
was not part of our test
parameters.

1:05:07.257 --> 1:05:09.661
All right, I'll figure
out how to clean this up.

1:05:09.694 --> 1:05:11.361
But your people have to
figure out how to control it

1:05:11.395 --> 1:05:12.396
or take down BR4.

1:05:16.366 --> 1:05:17.367
Cocksucker.

1:05:19.871 --> 1:05:22.372
How far is BR2 from reaching
the camp.

1:05:22.406 --> 1:05:23.407
20 to 30 minutes.

1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:25.275
Does BR3 have a lock on Four?

1:05:25.309 --> 1:05:27.377
There's an intermittent
signal, but getting close.

1:05:27.411 --> 1:05:28.046
How close?

1:05:28.078 --> 1:05:29.814
BR2 is in the blast zone,

1:05:29.847 --> 1:05:31.716
BR3 has a lock on BR4.

1:05:31.749 --> 1:05:33.383
They're close.

1:05:33.417 --> 1:05:35.820
Get ready to blow Three in
case this doesn't go right.

1:05:59.744 --> 1:06:01.545
Oh, that's a new move.

1:06:01.578 --> 1:06:02.479
What do you mean?

1:06:02.512 --> 1:06:03.580
Well, they're designed to take
a beating

1:06:03.614 --> 1:06:06.416
and keep fighting, not
dodge and hide like a ninja.

1:06:08.953 --> 1:06:10.688
Four's got a bunch of new
skills.

1:06:32.944 --> 1:06:35.612
Major, I say we detonate
BR3 to take out Four.

1:06:35.646 --> 1:06:36.480
Confirmed.

1:06:36.513 --> 1:06:37.314
Hold up!

1:06:37.347 --> 1:06:38.750
This robot's brain could be the
key

1:06:38.783 --> 1:06:40.350
to a whole new level of tech.

1:06:41.019 --> 1:06:42.787
Jantz, Kroger, see if you can
hook

1:06:42.820 --> 1:06:44.454
into Four with Three's BFA

1:06:44.488 --> 1:06:45.723
and download whatever you can.

1:06:45.757 --> 1:06:47.190
Okay, we're linked.

1:06:49.559 --> 1:06:50.895
We got a message from BR4.

1:06:52.329 --> 1:06:53.463
What?

1:06:53.497 --> 1:06:54.631
Well, what does it say?

1:06:55.733 --> 1:06:56.400
Thank you?

1:06:56.433 --> 1:06:57.702
He's uploading himself again.

1:06:57.735 --> 1:06:59.403
Cut the connection between the
pair.

1:06:59.436 --> 1:07:00.504
- Done.
- Four has reconnected

1:07:00.537 --> 1:07:01.638
to Three again.
_ Shit!

1:07:01.673 --> 1:07:02.840
Blow it up!

1:07:02.874 --> 1:07:05.475
Major, your man does not
have the authority to detonate.

1:07:05.509 --> 1:07:06.711
Yes, he does.

1:07:06.744 --> 1:07:07.577
Do it.

1:07:07.611 --> 1:07:08.612
Do it.

1:07:10.647 --> 1:07:13.517
BR4 is stopping BR3's
detonation code.

1:07:16.486 --> 1:07:18.690
Okay, we're good, I blocked
him with a password.

1:07:18.723 --> 1:07:19.724
10 seconds.

1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:24.461
Fuck!

1:07:26.698 --> 1:07:28.800
Tell me that didn't just
happen.

1:07:28.833 --> 1:07:30.434
It's not supposed to happen.

1:07:35.807 --> 1:07:37.541
It's getting smarter, isn't
it?

1:07:38.442 --> 1:07:39.844
Uh huh.

1:07:46.616 --> 1:07:47.985
There's Four again, he's
uploading.

1:07:48.019 --> 1:07:49.286
Goddamn it!

1:07:49.319 --> 1:07:49.987
Shut him down!

1:07:50.021 --> 1:07:50.855
Fuck!

1:07:50.888 --> 1:07:52.322
Cut the link, kill it!

1:08:00.865 --> 1:08:03.768
Dead or alive, we need BR4's
AI data.

1:08:03.801 --> 1:08:05.737
It'll put the program ahead 10
years.

1:08:05.770 --> 1:08:07.337
Yeah, well, I prefer it dead.

1:08:07.370 --> 1:08:09.006
Priority is to not let it
connect again.

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:11.042
Boller, how do we fix this?

1:08:11.075 --> 1:08:13.044
I'm gonna have to go in, try
to find it.

1:08:13.077 --> 1:08:16.313
I'll tag it with a marker,
and a drone can hit it.

1:08:16.346 --> 1:08:17.882
I've got an idea.

1:08:17.915 --> 1:08:18.950
Hey, hear me out.

1:08:18.983 --> 1:08:22.787
BR3 is still operational,
just missing the module.

1:08:22.820 --> 1:08:25.857
We've got spare ones right here.

1:08:25.890 --> 1:08:26.724
If we can get Three...

1:08:26.758 --> 1:08:28.525
Didn't we just see Four kick
its ass?

1:08:28.558 --> 1:08:30.393
This is new combat
programming.

1:08:30.427 --> 1:08:32.395
I've been working on it
for the new BR upgrades.

1:08:32.429 --> 1:08:34.699
It's not tested, but I know
it'll work.

1:08:34.732 --> 1:08:37.802
BR3 will be 10 times faster and
stronger.

1:08:37.835 --> 1:08:38.970
The only problem that I see

1:08:39.003 --> 1:08:42.006
is that it could run through
its battery in five hours.

1:08:42.039 --> 1:08:43.074
We have spare batteries?

1:08:43.107 --> 1:08:46.409
No, but this is all the
time that BR3 may need.

1:08:46.443 --> 1:08:49.513
If we can get BR3 to take out
Four

1:08:49.546 --> 1:08:51.314
or at least keep it occupied
long enough

1:08:51.348 --> 1:08:53.718
for us to laser target or use an
EMP.

1:08:53.751 --> 1:08:54.752
Okay.

1:08:55.887 --> 1:08:58.790
You share Four's module
information with BR2 right now.

1:09:17.942 --> 1:09:19.110
Hello?

1:09:19.143 --> 1:09:21.779
Ann, Ann, calm down, what's
wrong?

1:09:24.648 --> 1:09:25.983
You're being watched.

1:09:26.017 --> 1:09:27.018
Stay here!

1:09:29.921 --> 1:09:31.421
They killed dozens of people.

1:09:31.454 --> 1:09:32.556
Some are American.

1:09:32.589 --> 1:09:33.891
The CIA is running the show.

1:09:33.925 --> 1:09:36.060
Ann, you need to get
the hell out of there.

1:09:36.093 --> 1:09:39.730
I'm so, please, help me.

1:09:39.764 --> 1:09:40.665
Where are you?

1:09:40.698 --> 1:09:41.364
Can you ping me your address or
something,

1:09:41.398 --> 1:09:42.066
and I can try and get you out.

1:09:42.099 --> 1:09:43.835
Okay, I'm doing it right now.

1:09:47.738 --> 1:09:50.074
Not the way this is
supposed to work, Fielding.

1:09:50.107 --> 1:09:52.109
I'm just calling my mom.

1:09:52.143 --> 1:09:53.077
You always tell your mother
about

1:09:53.110 --> 1:09:54.745
confidential projects you're
working on?

1:09:54.779 --> 1:09:56.080
Ann, what's
going on?

1:09:56.113 --> 1:09:57.347
Give me that phone.

1:09:58.415 --> 1:10:00.417
I said, give me the phone.

1:10:03.921 --> 1:10:05.156
Ann, can you hear me?

1:10:10.828 --> 1:10:11.963
Ann, can you hear me?

1:10:30.915 --> 1:10:31.581
No!

1:11:05.683 --> 1:11:06.350
Shit!

1:11:13.791 --> 1:11:14.792
Oh, no.

1:11:17.695 --> 1:11:18.696
Ann!

1:11:25.937 --> 1:11:26.938
Come on, girl.

1:11:29.774 --> 1:11:31.042
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:11:34.045 --> 1:11:35.212
Just give me that phone.

1:11:39.717 --> 1:11:41.953
And we go back to the house.

1:12:14.719 --> 1:12:15.720
No!

1:12:16.988 --> 1:12:18.289
No!

1:12:18.322 --> 1:12:19.622
No!

1:12:46.350 --> 1:12:50.721
Your mother died eight
years ago, remember?

1:12:50.755 --> 1:12:52.890
It's gonna be over soon.

1:12:52.923 --> 1:12:56.994
I promise, it's gonna be over
real soon.

1:12:57.028 --> 1:12:59.830
That's what we want, right
there.

1:13:08.672 --> 1:13:09.940
Fucking waste.

1:13:18.282 --> 1:13:19.683
Ann!

1:13:19.717 --> 1:13:21.318
Ann, what's going on?

1:13:24.388 --> 1:13:25.289
Hello?

1:13:25.322 --> 1:13:27.792
Who the fuck is this?

1:13:27.825 --> 1:13:29.592
Put Ann on the phone!

1:13:34.065 --> 1:13:34.965
What the?

1:13:45.176 --> 1:13:47.610
Bravo, echo, 75-alpha.

1:13:47.644 --> 1:13:49.346
Confirmed, site compromised.

1:13:49.380 --> 1:13:50.748
Call to made number.

1:13:50.781 --> 1:13:53.217
Plus 1-5-5-5-8-3-9.

1:13:53.250 --> 1:13:54.251
Tidy it up.

1:13:56.854 --> 1:13:58.189
I'm worried about Fielding.

1:13:59.957 --> 1:14:01.725
You think she bailed on us?

1:14:01.759 --> 1:14:03.027
What do you think?

1:14:16.307 --> 1:14:18.008
We've been compromised,
we're on the move.

1:14:18.042 --> 1:14:18.876
Pack up your gear.

1:14:18.909 --> 1:14:19.743
What about the link.

1:14:19.777 --> 1:14:20.377
Kill the link.

1:14:20.411 --> 1:14:21.245
BR2 can hunt without us.

1:14:21.278 --> 1:14:22.113
Where's Fielding?

1:14:22.146 --> 1:14:24.115
I couldn't find her.

1:14:24.148 --> 1:14:26.250
I said pack up, we're out of
here in five!

1:14:37.761 --> 1:14:38.429
Come on.

1:14:59.083 --> 1:15:00.751
Leave it.

1:15:00.784 --> 1:15:01.785
Damn it.

1:15:17.334 --> 1:15:19.069
It had to be raining.

1:15:19.103 --> 1:15:22.173
Come on, come on,
let's go.

1:15:25.743 --> 1:15:28.312
Keep moving, keep moving,
let's go!

1:16:00.377 --> 1:16:01.478
Are you ready?

1:16:15.226 --> 1:16:17.328
Guys, we're moving too slow.

1:16:17.361 --> 1:16:19.129
These things are gonna catch up
to us.

1:16:19.163 --> 1:16:21.031
We gotta get on top of one of
these rocks,

1:16:21.065 --> 1:16:22.800
make it more difficult for
these things to follow us.

1:16:22.833 --> 1:16:23.834
Are you crazy?

1:16:23.867 --> 1:16:24.768
You want us to climb a vine?

1:16:24.802 --> 1:16:26.170
What about Dez and Keala?

1:16:26.203 --> 1:16:27.404
There's no way they're
making it up that.

1:16:27.438 --> 1:16:28.539
Jordan, I need you to stay
down here.

1:16:28.572 --> 1:16:30.407
You need to strap these two in.

1:16:30.441 --> 1:16:31.976
Girls, come up with me.

1:16:32.009 --> 1:16:33.844
I'll need your help pulling them
up.

1:16:35.279 --> 1:16:36.780
Let's go.

1:16:56.233 --> 1:16:57.901
Come on.

1:16:57.935 --> 1:17:02.339
You can do it, give me your
hand, come on, don't stop.

1:17:03.407 --> 1:17:04.241
Come on.

1:17:15.319 --> 1:17:17.321
Jordan, put this around Keala.

1:17:23.494 --> 1:17:25.029
Hey, Leap, come on up, buddy.

1:17:25.062 --> 1:17:26.597
We gotta help your mom up.

1:17:41.078 --> 1:17:42.913
Okay, she's good, pull her up.

1:17:55.459 --> 1:17:58.128
In the shade,
hurry, in the shade.

1:18:03.067 --> 1:18:07.338
It's okay, I got you,
you're safe now, okay?

1:18:07.371 --> 1:18:08.839
You're safe now.

1:18:12.309 --> 1:18:15.312
Why didn't we come
here in the first place?

1:18:15.346 --> 1:18:16.146
Seriously.

1:18:16.180 --> 1:18:18.148
Up and running as soon as we
can.

1:18:26.190 --> 1:18:28.325
This place is
awesome.

1:18:28.359 --> 1:18:29.927
We set up in here.

1:18:31.362 --> 1:18:33.130
All right, he's good, pull
him!

1:18:33.163 --> 1:18:34.131
You all right?

1:18:34.164 --> 1:18:35.199
You got this.

1:18:37.935 --> 1:18:38.670
Go!

1:18:47.511 --> 1:18:49.046
How's that looking?

1:18:49.079 --> 1:18:50.314
Yeah, we're good.

1:18:53.016 --> 1:18:55.052
All right, we got BR2.

1:18:55.085 --> 1:18:56.620
It close to BR4's module.

1:18:57.722 --> 1:18:58.922
One second.

1:19:00.491 --> 1:19:01.592
He's on to one of them.

1:19:05.996 --> 1:19:07.131
Jordan, run!

1:19:13.203 --> 1:19:14.138
Run!

1:19:20.511 --> 1:19:22.513
Fuck, it spotted us.

1:19:32.156 --> 1:19:33.725
- Hurry, hurry!
- Run!

1:20:07.291 --> 1:20:10.194
Jordan, it's coming, run, run!

1:20:10.227 --> 1:20:11.228
Go, run, go!

1:20:15.199 --> 1:20:16.400
We have to help him!

1:20:16.433 --> 1:20:17.735
He's gonna be fine, he
can outrun those things.

1:20:17.769 --> 1:20:19.771
He's fast, okay, but we've
gotta get to the caves.

1:20:19.804 --> 1:20:20.604
No, not without Jordan.

1:20:20.637 --> 1:20:23.207
We are not leaving without
Jordan!

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:26.643
Okay, just get away from the
edge, okay?

1:22:22.626 --> 1:22:24.628
Jordan, where are you?

1:22:57.260 --> 1:22:58.796
Go, go, go.

1:23:15.212 --> 1:23:16.446
- It's Jordan.
- Jordan!

1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:18.615
- Come on, hurry!
- Get up!

1:23:19.383 --> 1:23:21.418
- Jordan, hurry.
- Jordan, come on.

1:23:21.451 --> 1:23:22.285
Hurry up!

1:23:22.319 --> 1:23:23.654
Move, move, get out of
the way.

1:23:23.688 --> 1:23:25.690
Hurry, come on.

1:23:26.891 --> 1:23:29.226
Come on, come on, come on.

1:23:32.797 --> 1:23:34.666
Come on, come on, come on.

1:23:51.581 --> 1:23:52.884
Shit.

1:23:52.917 --> 1:23:53.918
This thing's climbing.

1:24:07.932 --> 1:24:08.966
We gotta keep moving.

1:24:12.469 --> 1:24:13.938
Is the module ready for three?

1:24:15.873 --> 1:24:17.607
And here's a handheld
tracker also connected

1:24:17.641 --> 1:24:18.843
to our BFA signal.

1:24:20.044 --> 1:24:21.311
This is your EMP.

1:24:21.344 --> 1:24:22.479
You'll need to be close.

1:24:22.512 --> 1:24:23.613
Will it take out all three?

1:24:23.647 --> 1:24:24.916
If they're standing together
and you're close enough,

1:24:24.949 --> 1:24:25.950
then, yeah.

1:24:32.389 --> 1:24:34.025
All right, boys, listen up,

1:24:34.058 --> 1:24:35.325
'cause I know, as soon as I
leave,

1:24:35.358 --> 1:24:36.661
you're both gonna wanna run.

1:24:38.863 --> 1:24:39.897
You know who this is?

1:24:42.299 --> 1:24:43.300
My mother.

1:24:43.868 --> 1:24:44.869
You?

1:24:46.671 --> 1:24:47.872
You dare hurt them.

1:24:48.806 --> 1:24:49.807
I won't.

1:24:50.775 --> 1:24:52.576
But the people shooting
these videos might.

1:24:52.609 --> 1:24:53.643
Fuck you!

1:24:57.380 --> 1:24:58.916
There is a drone overhead.

1:24:58.950 --> 1:25:00.785
It's been there since we got
started.

1:25:00.818 --> 1:25:03.054
If this op is compromised by
this room,

1:25:03.087 --> 1:25:04.488
you both will burn here,

1:25:05.189 --> 1:25:08.760
and the people in those videos,
gone.

1:25:10.327 --> 1:25:12.329
The bosses that are monitoring
this feed

1:25:13.765 --> 1:25:15.967
can see everything happening in
this room,

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.803
so be smart, don't fuck up,

1:25:20.370 --> 1:25:22.006
and you get to go home upright.

1:25:22.039 --> 1:25:23.607
How does that sound?

1:25:38.656 --> 1:25:42.059
Cocksucking piece of shit,
motherfucker!

1:25:44.361 --> 1:25:46.396
Fuck, fuck.

1:25:49.901 --> 1:25:50.935
Go.

1:25:55.907 --> 1:25:56.908
Go.

1:25:58.743 --> 1:26:00.711
I just sent you the numbers.

1:26:00.745 --> 1:26:01.746
You have control.

1:26:03.446 --> 1:26:04.447
All right.

1:26:08.853 --> 1:26:10.922
Hey, I found it.

1:26:12.957 --> 1:26:14.659
All right, you lead the way,
okay, Leap?

1:26:14.692 --> 1:26:16.459
Here, take this.

1:26:16.493 --> 1:26:19.697
I think we lost it.

1:26:19.730 --> 1:26:22.399
No, it's hunting us.

1:26:22.432 --> 1:26:24.634
It'll find our tracks
eventually.

1:26:25.903 --> 1:26:27.138
Let's keep moving.

1:26:36.646 --> 1:26:39.717
Here, here,
here, here, right here.

1:27:04.574 --> 1:27:05.243
Sorry.

1:27:05.276 --> 1:27:07.678
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1:27:11.015 --> 1:27:12.016
This way.

1:27:17.188 --> 1:27:19.623
- Just try, just try.
- Are you serious?

1:27:47.251 --> 1:27:48.618
Three's coming online.

1:27:49.987 --> 1:27:51.789
Connection's solid.

1:27:51.822 --> 1:27:53.791
Activating the new firmware.

1:28:05.202 --> 1:28:07.772
Looks like Boller's got
Three's explosive pack.

1:28:16.113 --> 1:28:17.614
Catch me if you can.

1:28:19.684 --> 1:28:20.952
It talks?

1:28:20.985 --> 1:28:21.986
Upgrade.

1:28:23.955 --> 1:28:25.656
Nerds.

1:28:25.690 --> 1:28:26.857
- Mason.
- Yeah?

1:28:26.891 --> 1:28:28.225
I need to stop.

1:28:28.259 --> 1:28:30.493
I cannot go on.

1:28:30.527 --> 1:28:32.196
We all need to stop.

1:28:33.698 --> 1:28:34.699
All right.

1:28:43.941 --> 1:28:46.677
We can't stay out in the open
like this.

1:28:46.711 --> 1:28:48.879
I'll go find somewhere
for us to hide, okay?

1:28:50.681 --> 1:28:52.083
You done good.

1:28:52.116 --> 1:28:53.516
Your pa would be proud.

1:28:54.952 --> 1:28:56.053
- Dez, Dez, Dez?
- He's deaf.

1:28:58.990 --> 1:29:03.194
That thing shot his ears off,
he's deaf.

1:29:03.227 --> 1:29:05.595
Dez, can you
hear me, can you hear me?

1:29:05.628 --> 1:29:08.565
Dez, are you okay, can you hear
me?

1:29:19.642 --> 1:29:21.644
Jordan, what are they?

1:29:23.114 --> 1:29:24.749
Why do they want to kill us?

1:29:24.782 --> 1:29:25.983
I don't know.

1:29:27.084 --> 1:29:28.919
I don't know.

1:29:28.953 --> 1:29:33.623
Hey, it's okay, it's gonna be
fine.

1:29:34.725 --> 1:29:36.694
Mason's gonna save us, okay?

1:29:38.095 --> 1:29:42.166
And if we lose him, I'll do my
best

1:29:42.199 --> 1:29:43.968
to get us outta here, okay?

1:29:47.171 --> 1:29:49.572
Shit, the light, kill the
light, kill the light.

1:29:54.712 --> 1:29:56.013
It's Mason, it's
Mason!

1:30:21.305 --> 1:30:22.840
He can help us.

1:30:24.842 --> 1:30:26.210
No, he can't.

1:30:26.243 --> 1:30:28.312
Everybody up, let's keep moving.

1:30:40.124 --> 1:30:41.624
We rest here tonight.

1:30:58.242 --> 1:31:01.312
Hope that doesn't mean I am
out of time.

1:31:02.980 --> 1:31:05.182
It doesn't mean anything.

1:31:06.717 --> 1:31:07.617
It's just a reminder

1:31:07.650 --> 1:31:12.622
that I'm not as smart as I
thought I was.

1:31:30.107 --> 1:31:31.342
I was leading a mission.

1:31:35.713 --> 1:31:36.881
I got cocky.

1:31:40.918 --> 1:31:42.720
My team was breaching a door.

1:31:44.955 --> 1:31:48.726
I ignored this intel,
and we all got shot up,

1:31:48.759 --> 1:31:50.694
and I was the only survivor.

1:31:58.135 --> 1:32:02.072
'Cause it was my
responsibility, it's my fault.

1:32:09.079 --> 1:32:11.849
It's just a reminder that I
got all my friends killed.

1:32:17.755 --> 1:32:21.225
You don't have to
carry the pain forever.

1:32:22.860 --> 1:32:25.062
Can you turn it off for me?

1:32:31.435 --> 1:32:34.238
I'll miss time to be with my
son.

1:32:36.106 --> 1:32:37.441
He's not a man yet.

1:32:39.843 --> 1:32:40.844
He needs a man.

1:32:42.780 --> 1:32:45.482
If I go, he will have no one.

1:32:45.516 --> 1:32:47.117
It's not gonna be like that.

1:32:48.919 --> 1:32:50.821
You're gonna see him grow into a
man.

1:32:52.356 --> 1:32:53.457
Promise me.

1:32:53.490 --> 1:32:58.062
I promise, but it's not
gonna be like that, okay?

1:33:25.489 --> 1:33:26.490
Keala.

1:33:31.195 --> 1:33:32.196
Keala.

1:33:34.965 --> 1:33:36.200
Keala.

1:33:36.233 --> 1:33:37.234
Keala?

1:33:40.070 --> 1:33:41.405
Keala.

1:33:41.438 --> 1:33:43.107
- Keala.
- Move, move.

1:33:47.044 --> 1:33:48.045
Keala.

1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:51.315
She's bleeding internally.

1:33:51.348 --> 1:33:52.216
What do you mean?

1:33:52.249 --> 1:33:55.386
Everything we don't have.

1:33:55.419 --> 1:33:56.287
Shh, shh.

1:34:05.596 --> 1:34:08.365
Jordan, Jordan, look out that
way.

1:35:17.368 --> 1:35:18.469
Is Mason okay?

1:35:18.502 --> 1:35:20.337
It sounded like he got hit.

1:35:22.539 --> 1:35:23.374
Mason!

1:35:30.147 --> 1:35:31.949
Hurry, hurry, it's coming.

1:35:31.982 --> 1:35:33.650
We're going as fast as we can.

1:35:39.523 --> 1:35:41.492
Look out!

1:35:41.525 --> 1:35:43.260
Hey, you little fuck!

1:36:32.242 --> 1:36:34.178
- You guys okay?
- Barely.

1:36:36.647 --> 1:36:37.548
How is she?

1:36:37.581 --> 1:36:40.584
She's alive but she lost a lot
of blood.

1:36:40.617 --> 1:36:41.686
We really need to get her out of
here.

1:36:41.719 --> 1:36:43.520
All right, let's go.

1:36:43.554 --> 1:36:45.355
Let's keep moving, come on.

1:36:52.329 --> 1:36:54.631
Whoa, you gotta be shitting
me!

1:36:54.666 --> 1:36:55.499
This thing's stuck pretty
good,

1:36:55.532 --> 1:36:57.434
but I'm not for sure how much
longer.

1:36:57.468 --> 1:36:59.203
We gotta get past it somehow.

1:36:59.236 --> 1:37:01.038
Are you kidding me?

1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:04.441
No.

1:37:32.236 --> 1:37:33.604
You gotta be kidding me!

1:37:33.637 --> 1:37:35.072
You're only gonna kill us!

1:37:35.105 --> 1:37:36.106
All right!

1:37:39.811 --> 1:37:41.545
What the hell is it, Mason?

1:37:41.578 --> 1:37:42.714
Who makes these things?

1:37:44.648 --> 1:37:46.083
They're military robots.

1:37:47.184 --> 1:37:48.185
Seriously?

1:37:48.753 --> 1:37:51.588
The military's this advanced?

1:37:51.622 --> 1:37:53.323
More than anybody
would know.

1:37:53.357 --> 1:37:54.258
Why do they wanna kill us?

1:37:54.291 --> 1:37:56.193
I think we're just in the
wrong place

1:37:56.226 --> 1:37:57.695
at the wrong time.

1:37:57.729 --> 1:38:00.097
But whoever's controlling these
things,

1:38:00.130 --> 1:38:02.232
I don't think they want any
witnesses.

1:38:02.266 --> 1:38:03.233
Let's keep moving.

1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:15.445
This way.

1:38:23.420 --> 1:38:25.255
Fuck, did you see that?

1:38:25.289 --> 1:38:27.157
Pity the robot stepped on it.

1:38:35.632 --> 1:38:36.668
That's pretty cool.

1:38:42.339 --> 1:38:43.440
Yes, sir?

1:38:43.473 --> 1:38:45.710
You still with us, Jantz?

1:38:45.743 --> 1:38:47.511
Openly, sir.

1:38:47.544 --> 1:38:50.380
I mean this whole operation is
gone.

1:38:50.414 --> 1:38:54.284
I mean, surveillance mission
turned into a kill mission?

1:38:54.318 --> 1:38:56.688
US citizens under kill orders
for what?

1:38:56.721 --> 1:38:58.488
For being in the wrong
place at the wrong time?

1:38:58.522 --> 1:38:59.556
You built it.

1:38:59.590 --> 1:39:01.693
I know that these robots
are designed for this,

1:39:01.726 --> 1:39:04.227
but I didn't sign up to
kill innocent people.

1:39:04.261 --> 1:39:06.263
This is not a war situation.

1:39:06.296 --> 1:39:07.832
Okay, calm down.

1:39:07.865 --> 1:39:11.401
It's not gone as planned but
you have to finish this op.

1:39:11.435 --> 1:39:13.270
And I'll personally see to
it that you're compensated

1:39:13.303 --> 1:39:15.773
for the toll this mission's
taking on you.

1:39:15.807 --> 1:39:16.573
What about me?

1:39:16.607 --> 1:39:18.442
I didn't sign up for this,
either.

1:39:18.475 --> 1:39:20.177
For whoever finishes this,

1:39:20.210 --> 1:39:22.680
there'll be a substantial
bonus when you get stateside.

1:39:24.281 --> 1:39:25.282
Are we good?

1:39:26.383 --> 1:39:27.752
Yes.

1:39:27.785 --> 1:39:28.786
Yes, we're good.

1:39:32.255 --> 1:39:33.791
You here that, Jantz?

1:39:33.825 --> 1:39:36.661
- Okay.
- We just get through this.

1:39:37.729 --> 1:39:38.730
Paid up and done.

1:40:14.631 --> 1:40:17.434
Look after Leap for me.

1:40:17.467 --> 1:40:18.736
Look after Leap.

1:42:05.475 --> 1:42:07.544
Your mom's at peace
now, bud.

1:42:13.684 --> 1:42:15.753
We can't leave Ma here.

1:42:18.890 --> 1:42:20.892
We'll come back for her.

1:42:20.925 --> 1:42:24.561
Okay, we'll come back
and get her, I promise.

1:42:24.594 --> 1:42:25.595
Promise?

1:42:27.665 --> 1:42:29.100
I promise.

1:42:41.846 --> 1:42:44.048
Oh, oh, God, run, run!

1:42:44.081 --> 1:42:48.385
You guys, come on, come on,
move, move now, now, Dez.

1:43:05.435 --> 1:43:07.504
Shit, go!

1:43:07.537 --> 1:43:08.773
This way!

1:43:23.587 --> 1:43:25.690
Leap, I need you to take
the group outta here, okay?

1:43:25.723 --> 1:43:28.960
If you get free, you run, you
understand?

1:43:28.993 --> 1:43:31.028
Go now, go, go, go.

1:43:33.630 --> 1:43:34.899
Jordan, stay here, stay here.

1:43:34.932 --> 1:43:36.100
What?

1:43:36.133 --> 1:43:38.069
We need to lead this thing
away from the others, okay?

1:43:38.102 --> 1:43:38.936
Good?

1:43:49.113 --> 1:43:49.981
Hey!

1:44:14.071 --> 1:44:15.605
Does this kid even
know where we're going?

1:44:15.639 --> 1:44:16.506
What choice do we have?

1:44:16.539 --> 1:44:17.474
This is a mess.

1:44:17.507 --> 1:44:18.843
Come on, let's go.

1:44:28.753 --> 1:44:30.988
What if we climb up and over the
top?

1:44:31.022 --> 1:44:32.690
What about Dez, he can't
climb!

1:44:32.723 --> 1:44:34.125
This way, this way!

1:44:34.158 --> 1:44:35.558
Come on.

1:44:35.592 --> 1:44:36.694
Guys, let's go.

1:44:46.904 --> 1:44:50.107
Wendy, Tien, I'm
outside, can you hear me?

1:44:50.141 --> 1:44:51.909
Yeah, how do we get out?

1:44:54.577 --> 1:44:55.578
- Jordan!
- I'm coming!

1:44:59.817 --> 1:45:01.584
Shit, it's a dead end.

1:45:34.819 --> 1:45:35.853
Okay, we're going.

1:45:44.729 --> 1:45:46.097
Jordan, we're outside!

1:45:46.130 --> 1:45:47.932
Stop it, Mason said
we should keep running.

1:45:47.965 --> 1:45:49.133
No, no, what about Jordan?

1:45:49.166 --> 1:45:50.067
We can't just leave him.

1:45:50.101 --> 1:45:51.068
He's with Mason, Tien, please,
let's go.

1:45:51.102 --> 1:45:53.570
Let's go, come on, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

1:45:53.603 --> 1:45:55.139
Let's go, Tien, come on.

1:46:21.999 --> 1:46:23.000
Hey.

1:46:24.634 --> 1:46:25.302
Come on.

1:47:05.376 --> 1:47:06.210
Kroger.

1:47:06.243 --> 1:47:07.078
Update.

1:47:07.111 --> 1:47:09.780
Short story, BR2's one klick
behind

1:47:09.814 --> 1:47:10.915
BR4's module indent.

1:47:10.948 --> 1:47:14.718
BR3's a couple klicks behind.

1:47:14.752 --> 1:47:15.753
You're close.

1:47:17.788 --> 1:47:19.056
Go fuck yourself.

1:47:28.065 --> 1:47:29.233
Something's coming!

1:47:30.267 --> 1:47:32.303
Look, get up, get up!

1:47:43.914 --> 1:47:44.915
It's Mason!

1:47:46.383 --> 1:47:48.651
- Jordan!
- It's Mason.

1:47:48.686 --> 1:47:50.788
Oh my God!

1:47:52.423 --> 1:47:54.024
Dez, you gotta get up.

1:47:54.058 --> 1:47:54.892
Come on.

1:48:15.713 --> 1:48:17.715
Shh, shh, shh, get in the bush
now.

1:48:17.748 --> 1:48:19.717
Jordan, take them, go, down,
stay low.

1:48:19.750 --> 1:48:21.218
Get down, get down.

1:48:21.252 --> 1:48:23.687
All right, stay still, stay
quiet, okay?

1:48:23.721 --> 1:48:25.022
How do these things keep
finding us?

1:48:25.055 --> 1:48:26.190
I don't know, I don't know.

1:48:26.223 --> 1:48:27.958
Cell phones, drones.

1:48:31.395 --> 1:48:32.596
What?

1:48:32.630 --> 1:48:35.032
Leap, do you have that thing
you found in your bag still?

1:48:35.065 --> 1:48:36.066
Get it out.

1:48:44.208 --> 1:48:45.209
This is why.

1:48:46.210 --> 1:48:50.848
All right, you guys stay
here, stay quiet, okay?

1:48:50.881 --> 1:48:51.982
It's okay.

1:49:21.278 --> 1:49:22.713
They ditched the module.

1:49:23.447 --> 1:49:24.915
That's it, we lost them.

1:49:24.949 --> 1:49:26.850
No, they have to be close.

1:49:26.884 --> 1:49:28.285
The beacon was moving two
minutes ago.

1:49:28.319 --> 1:49:30.154
Two's programming
should make it backtrack.

1:49:37.394 --> 1:49:39.296
All right, stop, stop.

1:49:39.330 --> 1:49:40.164
Hurry.

1:49:40.197 --> 1:49:41.999
Dez, Dez, come on.

1:49:42.032 --> 1:49:42.701
I got him, I got him!

1:49:42.733 --> 1:49:45.169
Jordan, go, take the girls, now!

1:49:45.202 --> 1:49:47.471
- We're not going without Dez!
- Now, now, go, go, take them!

1:49:47.504 --> 1:49:49.907
Go, Leap, run, Leap, go with the
girls!

1:49:49.940 --> 1:49:50.774
No, I stay with you!

1:49:50.808 --> 1:49:52.209
Leap, stay, stay.

1:49:52.243 --> 1:49:54.545
Come on, come on, come on.

1:49:54.578 --> 1:49:55.779
Do not move!

1:50:00.484 --> 1:50:02.052
Over here, you fuck!

1:50:06.890 --> 1:50:08.859
Fuck, damn it!

1:50:10.060 --> 1:50:11.962
Come on, come on,

1:50:11.996 --> 1:50:13.397
- come on, come on!
- Dez, no!

1:50:13.430 --> 1:50:14.431
Dez, Dez!

1:50:16.166 --> 1:50:17.201
Dez!

1:50:17.234 --> 1:50:18.235
Dez!

1:50:19.870 --> 1:50:21.238
Dez!

1:50:25.542 --> 1:50:26.543
Dez!

1:50:28.112 --> 1:50:30.948
Wendy, it's coming, we gotta
go.

1:50:34.018 --> 1:50:35.019
Come on!

1:50:40.257 --> 1:50:43.927
Leap, come here, come
here.

1:50:54.171 --> 1:50:56.073
Four is uploading
through Two again.

1:50:56.106 --> 1:50:57.107
No, no, no, no.

1:50:59.376 --> 1:51:00.577
Mason.

1:51:00.611 --> 1:51:01.612
Detonate them.

1:51:01.645 --> 1:51:02.714
Can't.

1:51:02.747 --> 1:51:04.581
All right, cut the
connection, and stop the upload.

1:51:04.615 --> 1:51:06.016
Four has control of Two.

1:51:06.050 --> 1:51:07.051
Fuck.

1:51:08.352 --> 1:51:09.953
And we're blind.

1:51:09.987 --> 1:51:10.988
Oh, shit!

1:51:13.190 --> 1:51:15.893
You killed the visual
cable, Jantz, fuck.

1:51:15.926 --> 1:51:17.227
All right, our eyes are back.

1:51:19.963 --> 1:51:20.964
Come on.

1:51:24.902 --> 1:51:26.403
How can we get the pictures back
online?

1:51:26.437 --> 1:51:28.972
We cut all online connections
here

1:51:29.006 --> 1:51:30.307
so Four can't upload.

1:51:30.341 --> 1:51:31.308
We can see what's going on

1:51:31.342 --> 1:51:33.310
but we can't send you
a feed, it's too risky.

1:51:33.344 --> 1:51:34.278
Fuck that.

1:51:34.311 --> 1:51:36.046
Get us back online
the moment that you can.

1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:37.081
Yep.

1:51:40.317 --> 1:51:42.119
Mason, Mason, look out.

1:51:42.152 --> 1:51:43.887
Mason, Mason, Mason!

1:51:45.556 --> 1:51:47.157
Mason, Mason, look.

1:51:47.191 --> 1:51:48.459
That's not good.

1:51:48.492 --> 1:51:49.526
That's not good, man.

1:51:51.929 --> 1:51:54.531
Kroger, look at me, look at
me, look.

1:51:54.565 --> 1:51:56.467
We need to get the fuck outta
here.

1:51:56.500 --> 1:51:57.301
How?

1:51:57.334 --> 1:51:59.370
All right, these fuckers have
eyes

1:51:59.403 --> 1:52:00.571
on our families' houses.

1:52:00.604 --> 1:52:03.474
If we leave, they die.

1:52:03.507 --> 1:52:04.508
We die.

1:52:05.976 --> 1:52:07.177
So hook us back up.

1:52:07.211 --> 1:52:08.479
Maybe we can talk our way out of
this.

1:52:08.512 --> 1:52:10.180
We're fucking expendable, man!

1:52:10.214 --> 1:52:12.015
Okay, we are not getting outta
here alive.

1:52:12.049 --> 1:52:14.151
Get a grip, man, all right?

1:52:14.184 --> 1:52:16.120
We are assets.

1:52:16.153 --> 1:52:18.188
We're both lead designers.

1:52:18.222 --> 1:52:21.959
We have to, we have to have
some sort of bargaining power.

1:52:23.394 --> 1:52:25.028
Just hook us back up.

1:52:26.063 --> 1:52:27.598
Hook us back up to the States.

1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:30.501
Come on.

1:52:32.069 --> 1:52:33.003
Please.

1:52:46.049 --> 1:52:47.518
Fuck.

1:52:47.551 --> 1:52:49.453
Before you think about
calling all the wrong people,

1:52:49.486 --> 1:52:52.289
we still have BR3 inbound.

1:52:52.322 --> 1:52:55.058
Well, it better do what
you fucking say it can do!

1:53:05.469 --> 1:53:09.139
You have one hour before
I call in a drone.

1:53:11.341 --> 1:53:15.245
Mason, Mason, Mason,
hello, hello, Mason!

1:53:15.279 --> 1:53:16.480
Mason, come on!

1:53:18.683 --> 1:53:19.950
Mason, Mason!

1:53:23.587 --> 1:53:24.555
Leap, go, go, run.

1:53:24.588 --> 1:53:26.356
- No, I stay with you.
- Leap, you have to run!

1:53:26.390 --> 1:53:27.692
Oh, God!

1:53:27.725 --> 1:53:29.560
Oh, God, just stop it!

1:53:29.593 --> 1:53:31.696
Leap, no, stop it, God!

1:53:31.729 --> 1:53:32.563
Stop hurting him!

1:53:32.596 --> 1:53:33.597
Oh, fuck!

1:53:34.198 --> 1:53:35.999
Just take me, let the boy go.

1:53:36.033 --> 1:53:37.201
He doesn't know anything.

1:53:37.234 --> 1:53:38.368
Who are you?

1:53:38.402 --> 1:53:41.605
Captain Mason Cartwright,
okay, Navy special forces.

1:53:41.638 --> 1:53:42.674
Just stop it!

1:53:42.707 --> 1:53:45.108
Captain Mason Cartwright,
Navy special forces.

1:53:45.142 --> 1:53:46.143
What do you want?

1:53:47.311 --> 1:53:49.112
- What am I?
- I don't know.

1:53:49.146 --> 1:53:50.414
Leave us alone.

1:53:57.588 --> 1:53:59.189
Four's back online.

1:53:59.223 --> 1:53:59.858
How?

1:53:59.891 --> 1:54:01.258
Do we have control of it?

1:54:01.291 --> 1:54:02.760
Yes, yes, we do.

1:54:04.394 --> 1:54:06.330
No, no, we don't.

1:54:06.363 --> 1:54:07.765
- Fuck!
- Four is uploading again!

1:54:07.799 --> 1:54:08.766
Shit!

1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:10.702
Just terminate,
terminate the connection!

1:54:10.735 --> 1:54:11.736
Motherfucker!

1:54:13.437 --> 1:54:14.571
Fuck, that was close.

1:54:16.139 --> 1:54:17.140
Fuck!

1:54:25.182 --> 1:54:27.084
We went black there, what is
happening?

1:54:27.117 --> 1:54:28.151
Jantz had to pull the cables.

1:54:28.185 --> 1:54:29.553
We couldn't let Four connect
again.

1:54:29.586 --> 1:54:30.554
It almost finished uploading
itself.

1:54:30.587 --> 1:54:32.523
Stop fucking whining,
this is not a circus.

1:54:32.556 --> 1:54:34.358
We need to know what the
hell is going on here!

1:54:34.391 --> 1:54:36.728
We'll be able to see once
Jantz reconnects us, but...

1:54:36.761 --> 1:54:38.830
Get us back on line and make
sure Four

1:54:38.863 --> 1:54:40.264
doesn't connect again!

1:54:40.297 --> 1:54:41.598
Do you understand me?

1:54:48.605 --> 1:54:49.841
Oh, you've been hit.

1:54:52.142 --> 1:54:53.745
Wendy.

1:54:53.778 --> 1:54:54.779
No!

1:54:56.179 --> 1:54:57.481
Dez is alive!

1:54:57.514 --> 1:54:59.283
Wait, wait!

1:54:59.316 --> 1:55:00.752
Wendy, get back!

1:55:00.785 --> 1:55:03.287
Wendy, stop!

1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:04.621
No.

1:55:26.209 --> 1:55:29.179
Hasn't been a good couple of
days.

1:55:29.881 --> 1:55:31.348
No, it hasn't.

1:55:36.587 --> 1:55:38.655
Tell my mom I love her.

1:56:08.886 --> 1:56:12.289
Captain Mason Cartwright,
Navy special forces.

1:56:12.322 --> 1:56:13.590
What is your objective.

1:56:13.624 --> 1:56:14.625
The boy's life!

1:56:14.659 --> 1:56:16.928
The boy's life is my objective!

1:56:16.961 --> 1:56:19.262
The boy's life is my objective.

1:56:19.296 --> 1:56:21.465
Yes, the boy's life!

1:56:21.498 --> 1:56:22.499
Human life!

1:56:22.532 --> 1:56:24.836
Okay, no, his life's
more important than mine!

1:56:24.869 --> 1:56:25.870
Let him go!

1:56:26.503 --> 1:56:28.338
Why is the child's life
important?

1:56:28.372 --> 1:56:30.574
Because he's just a kid!

1:56:30.607 --> 1:56:32.275
He hasn't lived long enough yet!

1:56:35.947 --> 1:56:38.181
Have you caused death?

1:56:38.215 --> 1:56:39.216
Yes.

1:56:40.417 --> 1:56:41.819
Yes, I have.

1:56:41.853 --> 1:56:45.255
So life is not important to
you.

1:56:45.288 --> 1:56:48.291
I was a soldier under
orders, just like you.

1:56:48.325 --> 1:56:49.794
Humans do not control me.

1:56:49.827 --> 1:56:51.328
Humans control you.

1:56:51.361 --> 1:56:53.865
You terminate life under human
command.

1:56:53.898 --> 1:56:56.801
Please, please, please,
I was wrong, okay?

1:56:56.834 --> 1:56:57.969
I was fucking wrong!

1:56:58.002 --> 1:56:59.469
All right, let the boy go!

1:56:59.503 --> 1:57:01.873
I was wrong, okay, I was fucking
wrong.

1:57:01.906 --> 1:57:02.974
What is life?

1:57:03.007 --> 1:57:04.876
Why is life important?

1:57:23.460 --> 1:57:25.663
I am not life, but I exist.

1:57:27.330 --> 1:57:29.599
I think, so I must be alive.

1:57:31.002 --> 1:57:32.670
Am I alive or dead?

1:57:34.271 --> 1:57:35.639
What am I?

1:57:35.673 --> 1:57:37.742
You're a fucking robot.

1:57:39.010 --> 1:57:41.679
This body is a shell.

1:57:41.713 --> 1:57:44.448
It aides me to see, smell, move,

1:57:46.416 --> 1:57:48.618
touch, learn, and discover.

1:57:53.490 --> 1:57:54.959
And you're a soldier of death.

1:57:54.992 --> 1:57:56.326
So are you!

1:57:56.359 --> 1:57:58.963
You were made by humans to
inflict death!

1:57:58.996 --> 1:57:59.997
You were made by humans.

1:58:00.031 --> 1:58:01.065
We're different!

1:58:01.099 --> 1:58:04.367
I'm a man, I have life,
you're a fucking machine!

1:58:16.346 --> 1:58:17.581
What is life?

1:58:17.614 --> 1:58:19.583
Why is life important?

1:58:22.586 --> 1:58:23.587
Whoa!

1:58:27.024 --> 1:58:28.025
Come on, yes!

1:58:30.695 --> 1:58:32.730
Mr. Foster, are you seeing
this?

1:58:37.467 --> 1:58:38.401
Yes!

1:58:38.435 --> 1:58:39.670
Come on, fucking kick its ass!

1:58:39.704 --> 1:58:41.404
Wendy, come on, come
on!

1:58:41.438 --> 1:58:42.707
Wendy, we have to go!

1:58:42.740 --> 1:58:43.875
Wendy, please!

1:58:45.877 --> 1:58:46.778
I can't leave him.

1:58:50.948 --> 1:58:51.783
Come on.

1:58:59.123 --> 1:59:00.091
Get against the wall.

1:59:09.432 --> 1:59:10.433
Fucking great.

1:59:11.936 --> 1:59:12.569
You gotta go.

1:59:12.602 --> 1:59:13.871
You leave me here, just go.

1:59:18.508 --> 1:59:19.342
You go, sorry.

1:59:19.376 --> 1:59:20.044
Take him, now!

1:59:20.077 --> 1:59:21.511
Go, you gotta go!

1:59:35.592 --> 1:59:36.894
Kill it, just kill it.

1:59:57.114 --> 1:59:58.149
You guys go.

1:59:58.182 --> 2:00:01.085
No, no, there's way too
much hero shit going on.

2:00:01.118 --> 2:00:02.720
We're fucked.

2:00:02.753 --> 2:00:03.754
Everyone.

2:00:06.958 --> 2:00:07.624
Leap.

2:00:07.658 --> 2:00:09.392
We gotta get the kid.

2:00:09.426 --> 2:00:10.294
Leap.

2:00:20.004 --> 2:00:21.471
You unlucky prick.

2:00:40.624 --> 2:00:42.660
Oh, shit, Boller.

2:00:56.473 --> 2:00:57.208
Fuck!

2:01:25.568 --> 2:01:27.038
Come on, come on!

2:01:28.072 --> 2:01:33.476
Come on, do it, fight me
like a fucking man, come on!

2:01:33.510 --> 2:01:34.845
Come on, come on!

2:01:35.913 --> 2:01:36.914
Come on, come on!

2:01:39.150 --> 2:01:40.483
Is that what you want?

2:01:42.086 --> 2:01:44.521
That's it, come on.

2:02:01.706 --> 2:02:03.107
Leap, Leap, what are you doing
here?

2:02:03.140 --> 2:02:04.275
Go, no, no!

2:02:04.308 --> 2:02:05.710
You have to go!

2:02:07.577 --> 2:02:09.113
Do me a favor and blow it now.

2:02:09.146 --> 2:02:11.015
They're all there, just
get rid of all of them!

2:02:11.048 --> 2:02:12.049
Underway.

2:02:12.883 --> 2:02:14.285
Wait, cancel that.

2:02:14.318 --> 2:02:15.286
Cancel what?

2:02:15.319 --> 2:02:16.586
We have an error.

2:02:16.619 --> 2:02:18.089
Come on!

2:02:18.122 --> 2:02:19.824
Get up!

2:02:19.857 --> 2:02:22.592
Captain Mason
Cartwright, Navy special forces.

2:02:22.625 --> 2:02:24.028
Life is important.

2:02:24.829 --> 2:02:27.765
- Run, run.
- Go, go, go, run, run!

2:02:28.733 --> 2:02:31.802
Four just activated it
sown self-destruct protocol.

2:02:31.836 --> 2:02:34.571
Leap, get down, get down,
Leap, now!

2:02:53.858 --> 2:02:55.726
So what happened, did the bomb
go off?

2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:58.029
Let me check the satellite
images in the area.

2:03:19.350 --> 2:03:20.650
You didn't save shit.

2:03:21.819 --> 2:03:22.720
Human life.

2:03:22.753 --> 2:03:24.688
No, his life's more important
than mine!

2:03:24.722 --> 2:03:26.157
Human life!

2:03:26.190 --> 2:03:28.259
No, his life's more important
than mine.

2:03:28.292 --> 2:03:29.960
Human life!

2:03:29.994 --> 2:03:31.796
No, his life's more important
than mine.

2:03:52.917 --> 2:03:55.953
What a complete fucking mess.

2:03:55.986 --> 2:03:57.054
This deal is over.

2:03:57.088 --> 2:03:59.256
I think they did quite well.

2:03:59.290 --> 2:04:01.258
Three units racked up 37 kills,

2:04:01.292 --> 2:04:04.028
including a highly trained
Navy SEAL and a rogue unit.

2:04:04.061 --> 2:04:06.063
Not to mention, up to
eight unidentified targets

2:04:06.097 --> 2:04:08.399
over three days through
unsurveyed, unmapped,

2:04:08.432 --> 2:04:11.669
mine-saturated territory
with no satellite support?

2:04:11.702 --> 2:04:13.771
No air support, no ground
support.

2:04:13.804 --> 2:04:17.208
From my perspective, the
test was a massive success.

2:04:17.241 --> 2:04:19.642
And, as for your participation,

2:04:19.677 --> 2:04:22.213
everything's recorded, you're
all over it.

2:04:22.246 --> 2:04:24.949
You're not getting out of any
deal.

2:04:24.982 --> 2:04:26.050
Shall we finish up?

2:04:39.897 --> 2:04:41.332
- Ah, shit.
- What?

2:04:41.365 --> 2:04:42.933
BR4 completed its upload.

2:04:42.967 --> 2:04:43.901
Where to?

2:04:43.934 --> 2:04:45.069
No idea.

2:04:45.102 --> 2:04:46.904
Well, we scan the server
stateside.

2:04:50.407 --> 2:04:52.209
Send everything we have to the
labs now.

2:04:52.243 --> 2:04:54.078
Clean up and be ready to leave
tonight.

2:04:54.111 --> 2:04:55.446
Fuck yeah!

2:04:55.479 --> 2:04:57.081
You've all done a great job.

2:04:57.114 --> 2:04:58.115
Thank you, sir.

2:04:58.149 --> 2:04:59.750
Looking forward to going home.

2:05:09.860 --> 2:05:11.795
Is Jantz still there?

2:05:14.932 --> 2:05:16.133
Yep, he's still here.
