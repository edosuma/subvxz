Yeah, water under the bridge.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.245
Great. Okay.

26:57.295 --> 26:59.495

28:18.075 --> 28:22.125
I feel like I was sitting on the
toilet the last time I met you.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.785
[laughs] That is crazy.

28:25.835 --> 28:27.620
No, that's déjà vu.

28:27.670 --> 28:30.285
That's the mind taking an event

You cannot trust the mind, for
it will play tricks on you.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.380
Kevin?

29:13.430 --> 29:15.380
So nice to meet you.

29:16.385 --> 29:18.350
Nice to meet you, too.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.255
Would you like some water, Senator?

29:22.305 --> 29:24.060
Never touch the stuff.

29:24.110 --> 29:26.345
Kevin, I'm sorry
about all the security.

29:26.395 --> 29:27.680
<i>I don't know if Gladys told you,</i>

29:27.730 --> 29:30.230
but we received credible intelligence

29:30.280 --> 29:33.730
that someone may be
trying to assassinate me.

29:36.205 --> 29:38.020
Now why do you think someone
would want to do that?

29:38.070 --> 29:39.440
Murder me?

29:39.490 --> 29:41.990
Well, I don't know.

29:43.245 --> 29:46.630
It's because I stick to you, Kevin.

29:48.050 --> 29:49.665
<i>[laughs]</i>

29:49.715 --> 29:53.005
Throughout history
assassins have never

29:53.055 --> 29:56.290
been motivated by money or revenge.

29:56.340 --> 29:59.625
They're motivated by beliefs.

29:59.675 --> 30:02.545
And their targets embody a belief

30:02.595 --> 30:06.150
that enrages their
would-be assassins.

30:07.685 --> 30:09.105
Why?

30:09.155 --> 30:12.605
Because secretly,
they share that belief.

30:13.905 --> 30:16.695
John Wilkes Booth loved black people.

30:16.745 --> 30:19.445
Hated slavery. Hated it.

30:19.495 --> 30:22.030
- Did you know that?
- I did not, Senator.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.070
Well, he did.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.735
But he still popped Lincoln
right in his stovepipe.

30:26.785 --> 30:30.325
Bang. Emancipated from life.

30:30.375 --> 30:33.295
So I'm gonna ask you again.

30:33.345 --> 30:36.295
Why do you think someone
would want to kill me?

30:40.215 --> 30:42.135
You tell me.

30:43.435 --> 30:44.920
Because they'd rather
put a bullet in my head

30:44.970 --> 30:46.640
than accept my truth.

30:49.725 --> 30:51.760
And what is your truth?

30:51.810 --> 30:55.935
Well, shit, Kevin, you wrote
me a check for $50,000.

30:55.985 --> 30:58.065
What do you think my truth is?

31:00.285 --> 31:02.990
You want to destroy families.

31:08.380 --> 31:10.615
Write that down.

31:10.665 --> 31:12.915
That is fucking brilliant.

31:12.965 --> 31:15.535
Our polls say
our message is confusing.

31:15.585 --> 31:17.285
You just nailed it.

31:17.335 --> 31:21.340
I want to destroy families.

31:22.510 --> 31:25.630
The other day
I was in Northboro, Iowa,

31:25.680 --> 31:27.550
and I met a young man.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.215
I was working my way through
the crowd shaking hands

31:30.265 --> 31:31.970
and I see this fellow
and he's waiting for me

31:32.020 --> 31:33.635
and he has a baby in his arms.

31:33.685 --> 31:34.890
And I'm thinking to myself,

31:34.940 --> 31:37.975
"Shit, now I'm gonna have
to kiss that thing

31:38.025 --> 31:42.145
because that's what one must endure
if you want to get elected."

31:42.195 --> 31:43.980
So I pucker up

31:44.030 --> 31:46.615
and you know what
that young man does?

31:46.665 --> 31:51.885
He hands me the baby
and he just walks away.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.495
He gave me his child

31:56.545 --> 31:57.795
<i>and he disappeared.</i>

31:57.845 --> 31:59.165
<i>Police couldn't find him.</i>

31:59.215 --> 32:02.665
No wife or mother stepped
forward to claim it.

32:02.715 --> 32:05.750
And that baby is now in an orphanage

32:05.800 --> 32:08.720
and it's gonna be fine.

32:10.225 --> 32:12.010
It's gonna be fine.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.230
It's gonna grow up

32:14.280 --> 32:17.395
and it's gonna have difficulty
attaching to people

32:17.445 --> 32:21.350
and it's gonna have difficulty
giving and accepting love.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.690
But, Kevin, that is
no longer a difficulty.

32:24.740 --> 32:27.570
It is a strength.

32:28.660 --> 32:31.545
It is a survival mechanism.

32:34.750 --> 32:38.920
Because on October 14,

32:38.970 --> 32:42.705
attachment and love became extinct.

32:42.755 --> 32:47.510
In an instant, it became
cosmically, abundantly clear

32:47.560 --> 32:51.060
that you can lose anyone at any time.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.355
Our cave collapsed, Kevin.

32:57.405 --> 33:00.890
Now, we can spend all our time
digging through the rubble

33:00.940 --> 33:03.360
looking for signs of life,

33:03.410 --> 33:08.415
or we can transform.

33:24.095 --> 33:25.380
Do you mind if I ask you, Kevin,

33:25.430 --> 33:28.335
how you first heard about
what we are trying to do?

33:28.385 --> 33:31.135
How you heard about
the Guilty Remnant?

33:32.605 --> 33:34.260
No.

33:34.310 --> 33:37.645
My wife left me. Joined up.

33:37.695 --> 33:40.430
Patti: That must have been painful.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.195
Mm-hmm.

33:44.870 --> 33:48.770
No more painful
than when Neil left you.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.775
Okay, we are done here.

33:50.825 --> 33:52.695
No, that's okay, Gladys.

33:52.745 --> 33:55.780

you're locked out, too.

39:15.565 --> 39:17.350
<i>Hey.</i>

39:17.400 --> 39:19.485
You want a drink?

39:21.155 --> 39:23.235
Yeah, I do.

39:43.095 --> 39:44.960
What's your name?

39:45.010 --> 39:46.680
Kevin.

39:48.180 --> 39:51.180
You here on business
or pleasure, Kevin?

39:52.400 --> 39:54.470
Uh, business.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.405
Oh, yeah? Well, what
line of work you in?

40:00.245 --> 40:02.660
I'm an international assassin.

40:04.530 --> 40:07.250
- No shit.
- No shit.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.985
I wouldn't think
they'd let you guys drink.

40:11.035 --> 40:13.655
Oh, no, I'm done for the day.

40:13.705 --> 40:15.910
I eliminated my target.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.795
Turns out she was using
a body double.

40:20.430 --> 40:21.915
Like Saddam Hussein.

40:21.965 --> 40:23.415
Yeah.

40:23.465 --> 40:25.420
They really do that, huh?

40:25.470 --> 40:27.755
I guess they do.

40:27.805 --> 40:29.840
<i>Wow, international assassin.</i>

40:29.890 --> 40:33.225
You get to travel the world
killing people.

40:33.275 --> 40:34.895
No consequences.

40:34.945 --> 40:36.980
No wife. No kids.

40:37.030 --> 40:39.230
No responsibility.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.285
That's a great job.
I can see why you picked it.

40:43.570 --> 40:45.570
Yeah.

40:48.325 --> 40:50.360
What do you do?

40:50.410 --> 40:52.660
Me?

40:52.710 --> 40:55.495
I don't do anything.
I'm fucking dead.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.205
Choked on a piece of chicken.

41:00.255 --> 41:01.620
[laughs]

41:01.670 --> 41:04.540
Which is why we should
always do what our moms say.

41:04.590 --> 41:08.180
Chew before you swallow. [laughs]

41:08.230 --> 41:10.595
Now I'm stuck in this stupid hotel.

41:12.230 --> 41:15.600
Half the people, they can't
even remember their own names.

41:15.650 --> 41:18.055
The other half, they're running
around doing crazy shit

41:18.105 --> 41:20.890
like international assassins.

41:20.940 --> 41:24.325
And I can't find a single

41:26.945 --> 41:28.730
What?

41:28.780 --> 41:31.785
What, you gonna judge me now?

41:42.595 --> 41:44.710
Is your name Neil?

41:45.930 --> 41:47.665
Yeah.

41:47.715 --> 41:49.350
Why?

41:51.435 --> 41:54.640
That little girl in the room
is not your daughter, is she?

41:54.690 --> 41:58.140
Oh, you think there's
a little girl in my room?

42:00.395 --> 42:02.100
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:02.150 --> 42:05.485
I saved her from the pool.

42:06.985 --> 42:10.490
Well, you should have
let that fat cunt drown.

43:19.975 --> 43:21.725
Hi, Patti.

43:33.825 --> 43:35.575
Are we leaving now?

43:36.995 --> 43:38.860
Yeah.

43:38.910 --> 43:40.880
Do you know where we're going?

43:42.715 --> 43:44.580
I think so.

43:58.265 --> 44:00.635
Hello there.

44:00.685 --> 44:02.350
Can I help you, sir?

44:02.400 --> 44:05.270
Uh... yeah.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.640
We were actually looking for a well.

44:07.690 --> 44:09.390
- A well?
- Yeah.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.030
Um, okay, well, let me see.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.615
Are you sure it's not the caverns?

44:13.665 --> 44:15.900
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a well.

44:15.950 --> 44:18.065
Oh.

44:18.115 --> 44:20.035
Oh, here we are.

44:20.085 --> 44:22.370
Well, in Jarden, Texas.

44:22.420 --> 44:24.825
<i>I'm not sure what the hours are,</i>

44:24.875 --> 44:28.295
but if you head out now, I'm sure
you could get there by sunrise.

44:28.345 --> 44:30.745
It's a straight shot out the I-55.

44:30.795 --> 44:32.550
- Can't miss it.
- Great.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.965
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

44:34.015 --> 44:35.750
You two have a safe trip to the well.

44:35.800 --> 44:36.970
Thanks.

44:37.020 --> 44:39.590
He's gonna throw me in.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.090
Oh.

44:41.140 --> 44:43.640
Well, then I hope you have your
swimsuit with you, young lady.

45:12.340 --> 45:15.425
"With the arrival
of the European explorers,

45:15.475 --> 45:17.795
the land we now know as Texas

45:17.845 --> 45:23.215
was populated by the tribes
of 'in-diggen-ous' people."

45:23.265 --> 45:25.135
Do you know what that means?

45:25.185 --> 45:27.055
"In-diggen-ous"?

45:27.105 --> 45:29.305
Yeah, it means native.

45:29.355 --> 45:31.105
Like Indians.

45:32.940 --> 45:34.695
"The Orphan--

45:34.745 --> 45:38.815
the Orphan's Well outside Jarden
was built by one of these tribes.

45:38.865 --> 45:42.400
According to the ancient legend,
the well formed a conduit

between the world of the living
and the spirit world."

45:45.505 --> 45:47.455
Am I talking too much?

45:47.505 --> 45:49.910
My dad says I talk too much.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.495
He pushed me down
the stairs one time.

45:51.545 --> 45:53.710

47:34.315 --> 47:37.065
Taking her to the well.

47:37.115 --> 47:38.700
Why?

47:40.485 --> 47:42.405
I'm gonna throw her in it.

47:49.830 --> 47:53.835
The girl, is she resisting?

47:53.885 --> 47:55.635
No.

47:57.385 --> 48:00.170

she wants you to do it.</i>

48:03.140 --> 48:04.960
<i>Just like a woman.</i>

48:05.010 --> 48:07.965
She believes she can improve you.

48:08.015 --> 48:10.965
I don't understand.

48:11.015 --> 48:13.185
That's bloody obvious.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.315
You have a choice.

48:24.365 --> 48:27.280
Cross or jump.

48:30.535 --> 48:32.535
Why would I jump?

48:33.705 --> 48:36.290
Because you don't want
to kill a child.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.910
She's not a child.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.880
Yes, she is.

48:42.930 --> 48:46.215
And if you do this, it'll change you.

48:48.385 --> 48:50.770
None of this is real.

48:52.560 --> 48:56.775
Friend, this is more real
than it's ever been.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.425
How far is the well?

49:29.480 --> 49:31.380
Just a mile.

49:31.430 --> 49:33.895
There's no road. You'll have to walk.

I don't know.

50:28.870 --> 50:30.740
<i>What did he say to you?</i>

50:33.125 --> 50:34.575
It's private.

50:34.625 --> 50:36.530
Was it about me?

50:36.580 --> 50:39.245
Nothing to do with you.
Come on, we have to walk.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.645
I'm tired.

50:54.730 --> 50:56.430
I'll carry you.

52:44.925 --> 52:48.210
Do you want to drop me in
or do you want to push me in?

52:52.550 --> 52:54.965
Pushing is probably easier.

53:00.105 --> 53:01.805
What's wrong?

53:04.360 --> 53:06.095
It's hard.

53:06.145 --> 53:07.945
Why?

53:10.650 --> 53:12.815
Because I feel sorry for you.

53:19.790 --> 53:22.325
Would it help if I closed my eyes?

53:25.580 --> 53:27.500
No.

53:27.550 --> 53:29.750
Would it help if I say I deserve it?

53:29.800 --> 53:32.170
That's not true.

53:32.220 --> 53:33.540
Yes, it is.

53:33.590 --> 53:37.510
I talk too much. I don't listen.

53:37.560 --> 53:40.845
I'm stupid. I'm worthless.
I'm a fat pig.

53:40.895 --> 53:42.130
I don't know how to be happy.

53:42.180 --> 53:44.480
Please stop, okay?

53:49.020 --> 53:50.725
Okay.
