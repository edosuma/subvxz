00:01.460 --> 00:03.160
You killed our probation worker!

00:03.995 --> 00:05.085
He's got Tony's credit card.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.320
It doesn't prove he murdered Tony.
The most we can do him for is fraud.

00:08.355 --> 00:09.645
Don't take this the wrong way,

00:09.680 --> 00:12.805
but you look like
a panty-sniffer.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.480
Well, look at you, using your powers,
being all superhero.

00:15.515 --> 00:19.480
Everyone can do something except me.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.320
You don't need to use your power
on me. I'm already there.

00:22.355 --> 00:26.280
I'm not getting a shag
now I'm a homeless.

00:26.315 --> 00:28.405
Do you want me to walk you home?

00:28.440 --> 00:30.600
So I guess we're
getting serious, then.

00:30.635 --> 00:32.159
Do you wanna go for a drink with me?

00:32.195 --> 00:34.125
I'm your probation worker.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.160
You were just using me.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.585
I was a nasty slut.

01:05.620 --> 01:09.620
I went with so many boys and girls,

01:10.220 --> 01:14.220
girls and boys at the same time.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.900
I took part in...

01:17.935 --> 01:19.785
disgusting,

01:19.820 --> 01:23.780
perverted, unnatural acts.

01:23.815 --> 01:26.157
I was drinking

01:26.192 --> 01:28.465
and taking drugs.

01:28.500 --> 01:32.220
I used bad language all the time.

01:32.255 --> 01:36.220
I called my mum...

01:36.580 --> 01:38.360
...a "fat bitch".

01:40.140 --> 01:44.140
But I'm not like that any more.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.380
I'm a good person.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.425
That...

01:56.460 --> 01:59.840
That ain't normal.

01:59.875 --> 02:03.185
She went to my school.

02:03.220 --> 02:05.940
This one time, she's doing this boy
I know in her dad's car, yeah?

02:05.975 --> 02:09.940
She gets off him and sits
on the gear stick.

02:11.220 --> 02:14.380
She's on there for, like,
20 minutes, literally...

02:31.740 --> 02:35.740
Try that in your driving test,
you are definitely getting a fail.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.665
Or a pass.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.220
And maybe some kind
of internal injury.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.740
It's the same with
some girls on my estate.

02:44.775 --> 02:48.100
No-one's even getting
pregnant any more.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.545
What about your friends?

02:49.580 --> 02:53.340
I believe that's generally
referred to as a "paedophile ring".

02:53.375 --> 02:54.385
I'm not a paedophile.

02:54.420 --> 02:58.140
Yeah? You'd screw your own sister
for a slice of cheese.

02:58.175 --> 03:00.105
I don't even like cheese.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.905
That makes it even worse,
you sick bastard.

03:01.940 --> 03:05.940
Maybe she's done sitting on
her dad's gear stick. It's a thought.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.905
It's not just her, is it?

03:07.940 --> 03:09.460
Oh, yeah, look there's
more.

03:09.495 --> 03:10.780
I know him.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.225
Oi, you!

03:12.260 --> 03:14.185
Can I help you?

03:14.220 --> 03:16.665
Why are you all dressed like
retards?

03:16.700 --> 03:19.460
There's a meeting in
the community centre tonight.

03:19.495 --> 03:21.580
You should come along and find out.

03:21.615 --> 03:22.585
All of you.

03:22.620 --> 03:25.105
Right. Cool. See you there, buddy.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.060
He used to be a right
headcase.

03:28.095 --> 03:30.980
Bring your friends.
This is weird.

03:31.015 --> 03:33.217
They need our help.

03:33.252 --> 03:36.336
Things have to change.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.300

04:17.212 --> 04:19.985
She's never late.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.880
I think she's gone on holiday.

04:21.915 --> 04:23.705
Did she tell you that?

04:23.740 --> 04:25.960
She said she was going to Greece.
No...

04:25.995 --> 04:28.145
They would've sent
someone to cover her.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.825
We should phone
probation headquarters

04:29.860 --> 04:33.860
and get them to send someone
down here now to supervise us.

05:00.660 --> 05:04.660
Well, this is intense.

05:06.980 --> 05:10.980
Don't, Nathan.

05:34.820 --> 05:38.820
Can you get me a can of Coke?

05:40.180 --> 05:44.180
Fuck me.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.665
What?

05:47.700 --> 05:49.505
Don't you have any shame?

05:49.540 --> 05:53.540
Don't you have any dress sense?
Seriously, you look like my mum.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.300
And you look like a slut.

05:55.335 --> 05:56.505
Are you for real?

05:56.540 --> 05:59.860
You think having sex with boys
will make them respect you?

05:59.895 --> 06:03.180
If you behave like a slut,
they'll treat you like a slut.

06:03.215 --> 06:07.180
Freak.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.940
You don't need
to behave like this.

06:13.975 --> 06:17.940
You can be so much better.

06:30.620 --> 06:33.040
You just need to ignore Nathan.
He's a dick.

06:33.075 --> 06:35.447
He doesn't care what
anyone says to him.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.820
He thinks it's the same for
everyone.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.065
It's not, though, is it?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.465
Me and you. We're not like that.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.500
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him to back off, yeah?

06:47.820 --> 06:49.580
'I did it for you,

06:49.615 --> 06:52.025
'all of you.

06:52.060 --> 06:55.280
'I did it to protect you.'

06:55.315 --> 06:58.500
What you talking about?

06:58.535 --> 07:02.500
Nothing.

08:22.860 --> 08:26.860
So this photo in the magazine.
Is that actually you?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.745
Is it?

08:29.780 --> 08:32.960
So do you get any training?

08:32.995 --> 08:36.140
I'm just making conversation.

08:36.174 --> 08:38.236
I'll call you back, OK.

08:38.272 --> 08:40.265
I'm looking for Sally.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.299
Who?
She's a probation worker.

08:42.335 --> 08:44.980
Oh, haven't seen her, man.

08:45.015 --> 08:48.980
Can I take a message?

08:49.660 --> 08:52.020
You're all right.

08:52.055 --> 08:55.265
OK.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.025
What's he doing here?

09:08.060 --> 09:12.060
Who is he?
He's police.

09:12.860 --> 09:15.465
Morning!

09:15.500 --> 09:19.500
What is up with that?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.440
You want to tell me what's going on?

09:31.475 --> 09:35.440
What's with the makeover?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.040
If you dress like a slut,
people will treat you like a slut.

09:39.075 --> 09:40.637
What's happened to you?

09:40.672 --> 09:42.165
I'm sorting my life out.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.525
All the drugs and the drink-driving.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.300
I've done so many things
I'm ashamed of.

09:47.335 --> 09:49.787
And I...
touched myself in front of you.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.205
I'm pretty sure
you enjoyed it.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.885
Well, I shouldn't be masturbating
in public toilets.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.720
I'm saving myself until I'm ready
to make a proper commitment.

09:58.755 --> 10:02.280
It's a bit late for that.
No, it's never too late.

10:02.315 --> 10:04.680
And it's not too late
for you either.

10:04.715 --> 10:06.965
'Lisha, what is this?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.220
Has it got something to do
with that lot we saw yesterday?

10:10.255 --> 10:13.440
You should come to our meeting.
Did they do something to you?

10:13.880 --> 10:17.880
You used to have so much going
for you. You threw it all away.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.920
So pathetic.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.680
This isn't you.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.280
We can help you, Curtis.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.285
Excuse me.

10:43.320 --> 10:47.320
You know using marijuana can cause
epilepsy and mental illness?

10:49.760 --> 10:52.620
I'm talking to you!

10:52.655 --> 10:55.445
What's wrong with you?

10:55.480 --> 10:58.600
You don't need
to behave like this.

10:58.635 --> 11:02.017
You can be so much better.

11:11.280 --> 11:15.280
Nice cardigan!

11:17.320 --> 11:20.120
She's saying all this weird
stuff about sex and that.

11:20.155 --> 11:21.725
She says she's saving herself

11:21.760 --> 11:24.800
until she's ready
to make a proper commitment.

11:24.835 --> 11:27.165
It's a sad day for all of us

11:27.200 --> 11:29.440
when a bird like that decides
it's time to pull up her knickers.

11:29.475 --> 11:31.560
You realise that's my girlfriend
you're talking about?

11:31.595 --> 11:32.765
And I feel your pain.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.125
Wash your hands before you touch me.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.160
Have you finished?
The beast is back in his cage.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.965
He is sleeping.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
It's that lot we saw yesterday.
She's dressing like that.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.845
They did something to her.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.320
What, like brainwashing or
something?

11:49.355 --> 11:50.525
It's the storm.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.920
How d'you know that?
You don't know that?

11:52.955 --> 11:55.280
When weird stuff happens,
it's always the storm.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.480
Haven't you worked that out yet?

11:57.515 --> 11:58.925
He's got a point.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.725
Did you just suddenly grow
a set of balls?

12:02.760 --> 12:06.200
I've always had a set of balls.
You've just never seen them.

12:06.235 --> 12:09.485
That is about the gayest thing
I've ever heard.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.520
Shut up. We need to find out
what's going on with her.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.805
Alisha?

12:37.840 --> 12:41.840
What are you doing?
Waiting for you.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.320
Alisha!

12:47.355 --> 12:50.017
Get off me!

12:50.052 --> 12:52.680
Alisha!

13:37.720 --> 13:41.685
I got pizza.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.120
Why do you give Simon so much grief?
Leave him alone, yeah?

13:44.155 --> 13:45.805
I'm just screwing around.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.760
Well, it's not screwing around to
him. There's stuff going on with him.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.325
Do you love him?

13:50.360 --> 13:54.085
Ow! Jesus.
Just leave it, then.

13:54.120 --> 13:58.120
All right, touchy.
I'll leave your boyfriend alone.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.720
Is that a sock? Aw, it's crusty.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.085
Ah, don't put it on my pizza.

14:06.120 --> 14:09.320
Why are you sleeping with
a crusty sock in your bed?

14:09.355 --> 14:12.480
All right. Yes. It's my wank sock.

14:12.515 --> 14:15.165
Oh, no! Use some tissue!

14:15.200 --> 14:18.040
That requires planning.
Who's that organised?

14:18.075 --> 14:19.325
Oh, don't use a sock.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.760
Look, you've just
knocked one out, right?

14:21.795 --> 14:22.845
Poom-byo!

14:22.880 --> 14:26.360
You're lying there,
you're feeling cheap and deflated.

14:26.395 --> 14:29.840
There's a pool of rapidly cooling
spunk on your stomach.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.880
You're looking round
for something to mop up with.

14:31.915 --> 14:34.560
Oh, hello. What's this? It's a sock.

14:34.595 --> 14:36.637
Job done. Thank you.

14:36.672 --> 14:38.716
Maybe that's your power.

14:38.751 --> 14:40.725
I am very good at it.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.800
Have you had any more ideas
what it could be yet?

14:43.835 --> 14:45.977
I give up. I obviously
haven't got one.

14:46.012 --> 14:48.085
It's bullshit.
Where's the logic, huh?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.840
You're better off without it.
They're a pain in the arse.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.325
You know why it is, though?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.160
Because you can't improve on
perfection.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.680
Look, but don't touch.

15:04.720 --> 15:08.640
'Don't think about shagging her.
Don't think about shagging her.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.120
'You're thinking about shagging her.
You're an idiot.'

15:11.155 --> 15:12.645
You heard that, didn't you?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.200
I'm a man.
We think about shagging everyone.

15:15.235 --> 15:17.685
Thanks a lot!
I didn't mean it like that.

15:17.720 --> 15:21.720
You are so shit at this.
How do you ever get laid?

15:22.200 --> 15:26.200
I...get girls really, really drunk.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.365
So...

15:32.400 --> 15:36.400
do you wanna steal some booze?

15:39.280 --> 15:43.280
I should really have
my own keys cut for the bar.

15:47.015 --> 15:48.645
Get off me!

15:51.120 --> 15:54.120
Is it just me, or does
this look really suspicious?

15:54.155 --> 15:58.120
Alisha!
Get off me!

16:01.600 --> 16:03.285
It's Curtis!

16:03.320 --> 16:05.005
No, there's too many of them.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.640
And I'm not very good at fighting.

16:06.675 --> 16:10.640
I never have been.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.600
What's she saying to them?
Fuck knows.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.880
Did she just...virginise him?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.680
She's put one of those ribbons
on him. They're all wearing 'em.

16:29.715 --> 16:33.680
You mean one of these ribbons?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.645
Burn it! Burn it!

16:43.680 --> 16:47.200
Burn the drugs!
Free yourself!

16:47.235 --> 16:48.005
Burn the drugs!

16:48.040 --> 16:50.440
Burn the drugs!

16:50.475 --> 16:53.925
Bravo!

16:53.960 --> 16:57.960
Burn the dildo!

17:02.920 --> 17:04.805
Have you seen Curtis?

17:04.839 --> 17:07.040
They got him last night
in the community centre.

17:07.075 --> 17:08.484
There was some spooky shit.

17:08.520 --> 17:12.520
It's her. She's doing this to them.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.839
What are the aims of your
organisation?

17:15.875 --> 17:18.577
We're trying to encourage
self-respect,

17:18.612 --> 17:21.280
responsible behaviour,
respect for the law.

17:21.315 --> 17:23.605
What's so wrong with being good?

17:23.640 --> 17:26.484
Do you have a message
for the young people watching?

17:26.520 --> 17:30.520
All this drinking, and the drugs
and the anti-social behaviour.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.880
You don't need to behave like this.

17:34.915 --> 17:38.880
You can be so much better.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.245
Where is she?

17:44.280 --> 17:47.600
Ah, there's never a probation worker
around when you need one.

17:47.635 --> 17:51.400
You were sucking up to her
last week. Where is she?

17:51.435 --> 17:52.565
I don't know.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.125
We need to tell someone
what she's doing.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.640
Oh, yeah. Right. "Help!
Everyone's stopped taking drugs,

17:57.675 --> 18:00.000
"and urinating in the street."
Who are we gonna tell?

18:00.035 --> 18:03.445
This is every policeman
and parent's wet dream.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.560
C'mon, Barry. You're good at this
stuff. Think of something.

18:06.595 --> 18:08.717
Who's Barry?

18:08.752 --> 18:10.805
You are.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.720
His name is Simon.
Is it?

18:13.755 --> 18:16.640
I thought it was Barry.

18:16.675 --> 18:18.325
Sorry, man.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.760
It's Curtis and Alisha out there.
It's down to us.

18:20.795 --> 18:24.160
No-one else is gonna do shit.

18:24.195 --> 18:25.885
Oh, shit!

18:25.920 --> 18:28.445
We need to get her away from here.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.300
We need to find out
what they've done to her.

18:30.335 --> 18:32.407
What about her power?
We can't touch her.

18:32.442 --> 18:34.445
And what if that "virtue bitch"
shows up?

18:34.480 --> 18:38.480
She's vexing them with some kind
of Derren Brown voodoo mind shit.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.720
We need to gear up.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.165
What are you doing?

18:57.200 --> 18:59.880
You gotta have the right track
for this kind of thing.

18:59.915 --> 19:02.560
You need something up-tempo,
with a bit of edge to it.

19:02.595 --> 19:05.325
I'm thinking Jay-Z,
maybe a bit of Dizzee.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.920
You could be getting into
a whole race thing...

19:07.955 --> 19:10.480
Just pick one, for fuck's sake.
Oh, hold on.

19:10.515 --> 19:12.005
Oh, yes.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.800
That's the baby.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.765
We'll take her out
through the fire exit.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.080
You two go round the back,
check nobody's there. Don't screw up.

19:39.115 --> 19:41.497
I won't.

19:41.532 --> 19:43.845
Let's do it.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Have you seen Alisha?
I have just shat my guts out.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.400
Why are you wearing rubber gloves?

20:06.160 --> 20:08.760
I like your shoes...

20:08.795 --> 20:10.965
Brown.
What?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.880
What are you two up to?
I got to go to the chemists.

20:13.915 --> 20:17.880
I'll catch you later, big boy.

20:37.715 --> 20:40.645
Kelly?

20:40.680 --> 20:44.280
Kelly! Curtis saw us.
I think he's onto us.

20:44.315 --> 20:45.925
How's she supposed to hear us?
What?

20:45.960 --> 20:49.960
That girl, she's brainwashing you.
Come with us and we can help you.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.360
Kelly! Turn your iPod off!

20:52.395 --> 20:53.925
Kelly!

20:53.960 --> 20:57.960
You've got it all wrong. You're the
one that needs help. Come to our meetings.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.760
Kelly, what are you doing?
Get off!

21:03.795 --> 21:05.405
Alisha? Alisha? Are you in there?

21:05.440 --> 21:07.920
It's Kelly!
She's trying to take me somewhere!

21:07.955 --> 21:10.765
They're trying to take Alisha.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.200
There's a girl called Kelly
in there with her.

21:13.235 --> 21:14.325
Nathan!

21:14.360 --> 21:18.360
Kelly! Open the door!

21:19.480 --> 21:20.565
Kelly!

21:20.600 --> 21:24.480
Kelly, listen to me.
You don't need to behave like this.

21:24.515 --> 21:26.685
You can be so much better.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.240
She can't hear you.
She's listening to music.

21:29.275 --> 21:31.080
Alisha. Rip her earphones out!

21:31.115 --> 21:32.205
Nathan!

21:32.240 --> 21:36.085
Open the door!

21:36.120 --> 21:38.480
Kelly, they're coming for her!
Leave her!

21:38.515 --> 21:41.957
Nathan! Nathan!

21:41.992 --> 21:45.400
We can help you!

21:45.920 --> 21:47.685
Go!
We have to go.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.160
I'm not leaving her! Kelly!

21:49.195 --> 21:53.160
Come on!
Shit!

22:02.280 --> 22:05.160
They're coming for you.
They're gonna turn you retarded.

22:05.195 --> 22:06.685
You're next! You're next!

22:06.720 --> 22:10.720
You should come
to one of our meetings.

22:18.280 --> 22:22.280
They're everywhere!

22:34.760 --> 22:37.765
Come on, use your power. Save us.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.360
After everything you've done to me,
you want me to save you?

22:40.395 --> 22:44.360
Yes. Get on with it, you little
freak!

22:48.880 --> 22:51.125
You're gonna save yourself?

22:51.160 --> 22:54.600
You selfish bastard!
I'll remember this!

22:54.635 --> 22:58.600
I thought we were friends!

23:02.560 --> 23:06.560
Just back the fuck up!

23:12.920 --> 23:16.920
Get on!

23:21.555 --> 23:25.080
Fuck you!

23:35.200 --> 23:39.200
Who are you?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.445
Thanks for saving me and everything.

23:43.480 --> 23:47.480
You could've just
stopped and let me off.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.605
Kelly. It's me. Where are you?

24:03.640 --> 24:05.580
Answer your phone.
I'm losing it here!

24:05.615 --> 24:07.080
I'm freaking out!

24:10.560 --> 24:12.560
Call me, yeah?

24:16.100 --> 24:19.500
Graffiti isn't art,
it's vandalism.

25:12.780 --> 25:14.080
Kelly?

25:22.700 --> 25:23.800
Kelly?

25:38.420 --> 25:40.540
Nathan?

25:40.575 --> 25:42.325
Oh, no.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.580
Why are you in my bedroom?

25:43.615 --> 25:45.800
What did they do to you?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.485
I think I look nice.

25:49.520 --> 25:52.880
OK. Yeah. I suppose you could argue
it's a huge improvement.

25:52.915 --> 25:55.720
I get that. It's not you.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.165
That's a good thing.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.060
I had a terrible attitude.
I was so aggressive.

26:00.095 --> 26:02.507
Yes, but in a good way.
You're the only person

26:02.542 --> 26:04.920
who gives me a slap.
There's no bullshit with you.

26:04.955 --> 26:06.737
I was a horrible chav.

26:06.772 --> 26:08.520
I didn't like who I was.

26:08.555 --> 26:11.405
I... I did.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.920
I can't believe
I'm going to say this.

26:13.955 --> 26:16.965
I liked your attitude.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.180
I liked how you looked -
the way you scraped your hair back

26:20.215 --> 26:23.360
so sometimes you looked
a bit oriental. It worked for me.

26:23.395 --> 26:27.320
And your jewellery,
you know, Argos has a bad press.

26:27.355 --> 26:29.857
Who says you can't buy
an engagement ring

26:29.892 --> 26:32.360
and a George Foreman Grill
at the same time?

26:32.395 --> 26:35.285
Your make-up...

26:35.320 --> 26:37.765
This is probably better, actually...

26:37.800 --> 26:41.680
Look, what I'm trying
to say here is that

26:41.715 --> 26:45.560
it should've been
a complete car crash.

26:45.595 --> 26:47.637
But it wasn't.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.680
It had attitude.

26:49.715 --> 26:50.925
Like you.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.960
It was you and now you're not...

26:56.240 --> 26:58.885
you.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.325
Look at ya.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.285
You haven't achieved anything.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.320
You're a waste of space.
You're such a loser.

27:04.355 --> 27:05.720
There's no need to get personal.

27:05.755 --> 27:06.885
We can help you.

27:06.920 --> 27:10.920
I never...
should've left you back there.

27:12.240 --> 27:16.240
I shouldn't have left you.
I'm sorry.

27:17.880 --> 27:21.880
That was really inappropriate.

27:45.480 --> 27:49.480
The train now
approaching platform one is the...

28:44.880 --> 28:45.840
Good morning.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.137
Good morning.

28:47.172 --> 28:48.365
All right?

28:48.400 --> 28:52.400
Beautiful weather, isn't it?

29:15.600 --> 29:17.245
Nathan.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.040
I'm so glad you're with us now.

29:20.075 --> 29:21.685
I'm so pleased to be here.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.880
I was such a loser.
The drugs, the sex...

29:24.915 --> 29:28.005
all that fast food.
I was so miserable.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.040
I hear you.
You were such an annoying idiot.

29:32.075 --> 29:33.205
What's this?

29:33.240 --> 29:36.040
Oh, it's a petition. We're
campaigning against contraceptives

29:36.075 --> 29:39.645
being given out in schools.
Will you sign it?

29:39.680 --> 29:43.680
There's only one thing young ladies
should be inserting in themselves...

29:44.080 --> 29:48.080
and that's knowledge.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.360
Please excuse me.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.245
Change them back to how they were.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.965
OK. Just stay calm.
What's your name?

30:39.000 --> 30:42.920
Your voodoo won't work on me.
I can't hear a word you're saying.

30:42.955 --> 30:45.280
Now, whatever you did
to them, undo it.

30:45.315 --> 30:46.445
They're better off as they are...

30:46.480 --> 30:50.480
They're better off as they are...

30:50.560 --> 30:52.600
..Everyone was teasing me
for being a virgin...

30:55.200 --> 30:57.800
..I'm a nice person
and they treated me like a freak.

30:57.835 --> 30:59.160
Blah blah blah. Change them back.

30:59.195 --> 31:01.165
I can't.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.525
I can't, even if I wanted to!

31:02.560 --> 31:04.200
I can't, even if I wanted to!
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

31:04.235 --> 31:05.560
I don't understand how it works.

31:05.595 --> 31:06.645
What's that?

31:06.680 --> 31:07.965
This is ridiculous!

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
You think I won't do this?
I will put a bullet in your skull!

31:12.280 --> 31:14.405
Nathan?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.925
Nathan, what are you doing?

31:15.960 --> 31:18.820
I'm gonna stop this.
She did this to you.

31:18.855 --> 31:21.680
Are you reading
a university prospectus?

31:21.715 --> 31:25.680
Oh, Jesus! This ends now.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.925
Kelly?

31:28.960 --> 31:30.725
Kelly, don't!

31:30.760 --> 31:34.760
Help! Someone help me!

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
Everybody stay the fuck down
or I will shoot her in the face.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.000
You, down, down now. Stay down!

31:43.035 --> 31:44.400
Everybody, stay down.

31:44.435 --> 31:46.045
Get back.

31:46.080 --> 31:49.480
No funny stuff. Get up!

31:49.515 --> 31:53.480
Everybody down!

31:54.320 --> 31:58.320
In there.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.640
Stay there!

32:09.960 --> 32:13.960
Where are you gonna go?

32:20.160 --> 32:24.160
Nathan, please just let her go.

32:24.200 --> 32:28.200
She's got you thinking
this is how you're supposed to be.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.445
Well, it's not!

32:30.480 --> 32:33.405
We're young.
We're supposed to drink too much.

32:33.440 --> 32:37.440
We're supposed to have bad attitudes
and shag each other's brains out.

32:37.600 --> 32:41.600
We are designed to party.
This is it.

32:43.080 --> 32:47.080
Yeah, so a few of us
will overdose or go mental.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.525
But Charles Darwin said

32:51.560 --> 32:54.240
you can't make an omelette
without breaking a few eggs.

32:54.275 --> 32:58.045
And that's what it's all about -
breaking eggs!

32:58.080 --> 33:02.080
And by eggs, I do mean, getting
twatted on a cocktail of Class As.

33:04.520 --> 33:07.365
If you could just see yourselves!

33:07.400 --> 33:11.400
It breaks my heart.
You're wearing cardigans!

33:11.560 --> 33:13.485
We had it all.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.520
We fucked up bigger and better than
any generation that came before us.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.400
We were so beautiful!

33:26.640 --> 33:29.000
We're screw-ups.

33:29.035 --> 33:31.325
I'm a screw-up

33:31.360 --> 33:35.360
and I plan to be a screw-up
until my late 20s,

33:35.880 --> 33:38.005
maybe even my early 30s.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.040
And I will shag my own mother
before I let her...

33:41.075 --> 33:45.040
or anyone else
take that away from me!

33:48.680 --> 33:50.445
Your gun's leaking.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.245
So you threatened me
with a water pistol!

33:53.280 --> 33:55.520
You're just like the rest of them,
aren't you?

33:55.555 --> 33:57.160
You'd be so much happier if you...

33:57.195 --> 33:59.960
I still can't hear you.

33:59.995 --> 34:01.605
Oh! You idiot!

34:01.640 --> 34:05.640
All right, love, calm down.
Honk, honk, honk!

34:11.880 --> 34:14.520
Save me, Barry!

34:29.320 --> 34:31.120
What am I wearing?

34:31.155 --> 34:32.920
What are you wearing?

34:32.955 --> 34:35.177
Where's Nathan?

34:37.435 --> 34:40.280
Nathan! No!

34:40.315 --> 34:41.445
No.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.159
Rewind time.
Stop this happening. Do it!

34:45.195 --> 34:46.764
I don't know how to do it!

34:46.800 --> 34:50.800
You got to save him.
He's not allowed to die!

36:16.000 --> 36:17.665
We should go celebrate.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.600
Not celebrate like, "Whoo! I'm
so happy!" Just like, you know...

36:25.360 --> 36:29.360
Can we just go for a drink?

36:38.560 --> 36:40.100
Kelly...

36:40.535 --> 36:42.040
Come on.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.960
To Nathan.

37:07.240 --> 37:11.240
Prick.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.845
'Up on the roof.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.725
'I tried to save him.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.040
'There was nothing I could do.

37:20.075 --> 37:24.040
'I'm sorry.'

37:25.440 --> 37:26.525
I'm gonna go.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.200
Stay for another drink.

37:29.235 --> 37:31.840
I'll see you Monday.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.240
I'm gonna go too.

37:42.275 --> 37:44.840
See you later.

37:44.875 --> 37:48.840
Later.

38:39.800 --> 38:43.800
Kelly.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.680
This is for you.

38:47.715 --> 38:50.337
What is it?

38:50.372 --> 38:52.960
Watch it.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.405
Pervert!

39:17.440 --> 39:20.400
He's trying to kiss me!
He's trying to kiss me!

39:20.435 --> 39:20.765
Give it back!

39:20.800 --> 39:21.880
Give it back!
Ow, stop hitting me!

39:21.915 --> 39:24.317
Cock, anus, bit of ball sack...

39:24.352 --> 39:26.685
If I was trying to wind you up,

39:26.720 --> 39:28.960
I think I'd be
a little bit more creative.

39:28.995 --> 39:30.937
I know what film
you saw last summer.

39:30.972 --> 39:32.845
Where are the other
ASBO shitheads?

39:32.880 --> 39:36.400
Well done! Really, I'm touched,
I've got a lump in my throat.

39:36.435 --> 39:37.517
Twat!

39:37.552 --> 39:38.565
Pervert!

39:38.600 --> 39:39.685
Melon-fucker!

39:39.720 --> 39:43.720
I've got a power, I know it,
I can feel it in my balls.

39:48.080 --> 39:52.080
I wasn't ready.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.960
Where are the brakes on this thing?
Oh, shit!

39:58.840 --> 40:02.440
So do we have a deal?

40:02.475 --> 40:06.165
High five!

40:06.200 --> 40:10.200
Oh, come on, I was only joking.
You'll regret this!

40:14.000 --> 40:15.485
Classic!

41:00.920 --> 41:04.000
Ah, I'm alive.

41:04.035 --> 41:07.080
I didn't die.

41:09.280 --> 41:13.280
I'm immortal.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.765
That's it!

41:15.800 --> 41:18.045
I've got a power!

41:18.080 --> 41:21.120
I bloody knew it. I've got a power!

41:21.155 --> 41:25.120
Ha-ha! Who's laughing now?

41:29.560 --> 41:31.180
Help!

41:32.742 --> 41:34.165
Help!

41:34.200 --> 41:36.800
I'm alive!

41:37.840 --> 41:40.920
You buried me alive, you dicks!

41:40.955 --> 41:44.920
Help!

41:53.680 --> 41:55.565
I'm immortal.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.600
That's just great!
Thank you, thanks a lot!

42:13.080 --> 42:16.020
Un-fucking-believable!
