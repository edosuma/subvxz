Oh, fun! Look, Peter.

00:39.648 --> 00:42.025
Smash Mouth is playing here
next weekend.

00:42.026 --> 00:44.527
- In Quahog?
- No, in this porn store.

00:44.528 --> 00:46.029
- (scanner beeps)
- Well, you caught us.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.530
Lois and I are stocking up

00:47.531 --> 00:49.866
for a very special
anniversary evening,

00:49.867 --> 00:52.127
and I'm not sure
that five percent discount

00:52.128 --> 00:53.911
was worth checking in here
on Facebook.

00:53.912 --> 00:55.288
(phone chimes)

00:55.289 --> 00:57.382
Ew, Meg, don't "like" that.

00:57.383 --> 00:59.751
Anyway, to celebrate,
we thought it would be fun

00:59.752 --> 01:03.671
to recount the three greatest
love stories ever told.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.257
We'll begin
with the tale of Helen of Troy:

01:06.258 --> 01:09.010
"The face that launched
a thousand ships."

01:09.011 --> 01:10.845
Which is the poetic way
of saying,

01:10.846 --> 01:12.948
"Helen of Troy was thicc, tho."

01:12.949 --> 01:15.016
Which is the Black Twitter way
of saying,

01:15.017 --> 01:17.160
"She was very attractive."

01:17.161 --> 01:19.161
(exotic vocalizing)

01:24.568 --> 01:26.295
The people of Troy's chocolate

01:26.296 --> 01:27.987
has gotten
into our peanut butter.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.581
The people of Greece's
peanut butter

01:29.582 --> 01:31.324
has gotten
all over our chocolate!

01:31.325 --> 01:33.501
We could perhaps
try the combined taste,

01:33.502 --> 01:35.754
or we could fight to the death.

01:35.755 --> 01:38.456
Guys, stop! The Battle of
the Greece's Peanut Butter Cup

01:38.457 --> 01:39.874
has gone on too long.

01:39.875 --> 01:42.853
Let us agree to disagree.

01:42.854 --> 01:46.097
Huh, what a pleasantly
de-escalating phrase

01:46.098 --> 01:48.066
that I'm just now hearing
for the first time.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.802
Yes, we will agree to disagree.

01:50.803 --> 01:53.638
The war between the Greeks
and the Trojans is over!

01:53.639 --> 01:54.806
(cheering)

01:54.807 --> 01:56.216
To Greece!

01:56.217 --> 01:59.069
Now let's go call a bunch
of jagged rocks a beach.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.812
(pained grunting)

02:00.813 --> 02:02.247
- Ooh! Ow!
- Sharp! Sharp! Sharp!

02:02.248 --> 02:03.581
- Hot!
- Hot!

02:07.045 --> 02:08.777
Man, I'm happy the war is over.

02:08.779 --> 02:10.780
I can't wait
to get back to Troy.

02:10.781 --> 02:12.674
Yeah, I'm just gonna plop down
with my kids

02:12.675 --> 02:14.826
and watch <i> Troy Story.</i>

02:14.827 --> 02:18.996
To the other side
of that hill... and beyond!

02:18.997 --> 02:22.184
That's as far as we know about
right now.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.543
You know what I just realized?

02:23.544 --> 02:26.888
This. This could be
a really long poem.

02:26.889 --> 02:29.483
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Helen's in my cabin,

02:29.484 --> 02:33.136
and I thought I'd give
heterosexual sex a try.

02:33.137 --> 02:34.178
(door creaks)

02:34.179 --> 02:36.448
Helen?! What the Hades?!

02:36.449 --> 02:37.765
What? She's hot.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.559
But not as hot as Medusa.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.895
Ah, one look at Medusa,
and I'm rock hard.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.914
Mythologically correct.

02:48.285 --> 02:51.621
Coming up, Greek food voted
burpiest in the world.

02:51.622 --> 02:53.823
But first, in tragedy news:

02:53.824 --> 02:57.127
your queen, Helen, has run off
with Paris back to Troy.

02:57.128 --> 02:58.911
This is an outrage!

02:58.912 --> 03:02.257
I'll send my entire army after
them, led by my best warriors!

03:02.258 --> 03:04.725
Achilles, ACL, get in here!

03:05.961 --> 03:07.978
(pained grunting)

03:09.607 --> 03:11.858
- What?
- Helen has run off with Paris!

03:11.859 --> 03:14.719
We're going to get her back
and burn Troy to the ground.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.062
Well, that sounds good.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.723
I just need to cancel my lesson
with Socrates first.

03:18.724 --> 03:21.100
Isn't he that thinker
they keep shuffling around

03:21.101 --> 03:22.786
from one philosophy school
district to the next?

03:22.787 --> 03:24.287
No, no, he's the one

03:24.288 --> 03:26.522
whose method is all about
asking questions.

03:26.523 --> 03:28.900
- Like what?
- "Have you ever tried wine?"

03:28.901 --> 03:30.118
"Can you keep a secret?"

03:30.119 --> 03:32.403
"You know this is
your fault, right?"

03:32.404 --> 03:36.040
Yeah, he'll... he'll make you
question a lot about yourself.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.842
¶ ¶

03:41.288 --> 03:42.497
So, we'll sail directly east,

03:42.498 --> 03:45.082
and then head north
at a 90 degree angle.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.919
It's the fastest possible way
I can imagine getting there.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.521
Hang on. Let me see that.

03:49.522 --> 03:52.441
Pythagoras just invented this
thing called a "hypotenuse."

03:52.442 --> 03:55.384
If we know this distance
and this distance,

03:55.385 --> 03:58.054
we can calculate
this more direct route.

03:58.055 --> 04:01.641
Wow. Our people are, like,
really smart.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.434
I bet Greeks will
always be known

04:03.435 --> 04:06.562
for their advancements in math
and not as cartoon characters

04:06.563 --> 04:10.149
with very hairy arms and
a tragically mismanaged economy.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.084
¶ ¶

04:19.952 --> 04:22.846
Okay, I had a feeling this
fortress would be impenetrable,

04:22.847 --> 04:25.348
so I've hired the finest builder
in Greece

04:25.349 --> 04:27.500
to make us a giant wooden horse.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.211
We'll hide inside it,
they'll take it in as a gift,

04:30.212 --> 04:32.639
and then we spring out
and destroy the city.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.423
I call it "the Trojan horse."

04:34.424 --> 04:35.925
Well, that sounds great,

04:35.926 --> 04:38.386
but there's another door
right here that's just beads.

04:38.387 --> 04:40.513
- What?
- Yeah. Just beads. See?

04:40.514 --> 04:42.699
Oh, boy, this...

04:42.700 --> 04:44.943
this is gonna be
a difficult phone call.

04:44.944 --> 04:46.310
Let's go! Let's go!

04:46.311 --> 04:48.530
This needs to be done yesterday!

04:48.531 --> 04:49.831
- (phone ringing)

Can I help you?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.495
What?!

04:55.496 --> 04:57.463
(all yelling)

05:01.135 --> 05:03.385
(wind whistling)

05:05.581 --> 05:07.224
Where the hell is everyone?

05:07.225 --> 05:08.466
Well, they left a note.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.835
It says
Helen and Paris went back

05:10.836 --> 05:13.063
to the Greek Isles
to get married... (gasps)

05:13.064 --> 05:17.016
And all three of Helen's fathers
are going to be there?!

05:17.017 --> 05:20.469
¶<i> Dancing queen...</i> ¶

05:20.470 --> 05:21.863
They came!

05:21.864 --> 05:24.190
Awesome! And now
that we're owned by Disney,

05:24.191 --> 05:26.225
we can have Hercules here.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.810
No?

05:27.811 --> 05:29.362
They-they won't let us use him?

05:29.363 --> 05:31.647
What was the point
of this whole merger?

05:31.648 --> 05:33.566
Well, who <i> can</i> we use?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.868
"Launchpad McQuack"?

05:34.869 --> 05:36.995
No. No. No, you know what?
I'm exhausted.

05:36.996 --> 05:39.339
I'm exhausted
with being told "no."

05:39.340 --> 05:41.091
And now I'm married. Ugh.

05:41.092 --> 05:44.035
I'm gonna go break wieners
off statues.

Welcome back. My credit card
got declined at the sex store.

05:57.883 --> 06:00.051
We ran off with only the stuff
we could keister.

06:00.052 --> 06:03.071
Our next love story is
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

06:03.072 --> 06:06.149
a 500-year-old tale
about horny preteens

06:06.150 --> 06:10.061
that society somehow decided
is classy and not perverted,

06:10.062 --> 06:13.907
even though two middle schoolers
bang in it. Enjoy.

06:13.908 --> 06:16.651
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

06:16.652 --> 06:19.028
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.864
Well, I'd say
Verona's better than fair.

06:21.865 --> 06:23.866
<i>They's gettin' a Shake Shack</i>
<i>this summer.</i>

06:23.867 --> 06:26.753
<i>Ooh, milkshakes</i>
<i>and crinkly fries.</i>

06:26.754 --> 06:28.889
<i>Gonna have myself a pooch-belly</i>
<i>if I's not careful.</i>

06:28.890 --> 06:30.532
<i>I'm sorry, y'all.</i>

06:30.533 --> 06:33.709
<i>I done chatterboxed my way</i>
<i>through the whole prologue.</i>

06:33.710 --> 06:35.252
Boy, this is nice.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.847
Will there ever be
a more popular Italian city

06:37.848 --> 06:39.182
- than Verona?
- I don't know.

06:39.183 --> 06:41.592
Are we even supposed
to <i> be</i> at this party?

06:41.593 --> 06:42.936
If they find out
we're Montagues,

06:42.937 --> 06:44.529
they might razz us!

06:44.530 --> 06:46.472
Relax.
No one's gonna recognize us.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.141
We got inch-wide masks
over just our eyes,

06:49.142 --> 06:51.102
with the rest of our faces
plainly visible.

06:51.103 --> 06:52.144
We're fine.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.197
You wanted to see me, Daddy?

06:54.198 --> 06:55.898
Juliet, honey, we need to talk.

06:55.899 --> 06:57.316
You're a grown woman now,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.276
and it's time
for you to get married.

06:59.277 --> 07:01.212
Grown woman?! Daddy, I'm 13.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.756
Shh. Uh, don't say that.

07:02.757 --> 07:03.882
Tell people you're 11!

07:03.883 --> 07:05.908
Do you want
to get married or not?!

07:05.909 --> 07:07.418
(sighs)
Fine.

07:07.419 --> 07:09.078
Now, I found you
the most eligible bachelor

07:09.079 --> 07:11.038
in all of Italy.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.749
He's from the Boyardee family.
Kind of a big deal.

07:13.750 --> 07:17.920
My family makes the best canned
sugar pastas in all the land.

07:17.921 --> 07:20.006
Are you out of breath
from saying one sentence?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.632
Just give me a second.

07:21.633 --> 07:24.277
I'm in the midst of a full-on,
lockdown sodium headache.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.354
I haven't peed for 36 hours.

07:26.355 --> 07:28.097
Whew. Okay.

07:28.098 --> 07:31.726
Now, fair Juliet,
let our houses join together,

07:31.727 --> 07:34.812
like beef... and roni.

07:34.813 --> 07:36.397
¶ ¶

07:36.398 --> 07:37.665
Ah, cool!

(squeaking)

07:55.917 --> 07:57.811
What... what is that?

07:57.812 --> 07:59.295
It says "hole."

07:59.296 --> 08:00.722
I don't get it.

08:00.723 --> 08:01.856
You wrote "butt."

08:01.857 --> 08:03.507
Okay.

08:03.508 --> 08:04.675
I'll... I'll come over there.

08:04.676 --> 08:05.835
(grunts)

08:05.836 --> 08:08.012
Hey, there's something
I want you to see.

08:08.013 --> 08:10.890
Some greaseball at the bar
just drew a guy in a circle.

08:10.891 --> 08:14.060
It's amazing. He's this,
and then he's this.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.328
You-you just...
y-you got to come see it!

08:17.898 --> 08:20.366
Romeo, we got
to get out of here!

08:20.367 --> 08:23.152
Tybalt found out we're
Montagues, and he's pissed.

08:23.153 --> 08:25.946
Oh, man, I-I must have amnesia
or something,

08:25.947 --> 08:28.324
'cause I don't (bleep) remember
inviting you guys.

08:28.325 --> 08:30.960
- Who are you here with?
- Uh... Tony?

08:30.961 --> 08:32.712
Gonna have to do better
than that, man.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.804
Lot of Tonys here.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.339
Oh, did I say "Tony"?

08:35.340 --> 08:39.677
I-I meant... I'm Abe Froman,
the sausage king of Chicago.

08:39.678 --> 08:42.438
<i>You're</i> Abe Froman,

08:42.440 --> 08:43.714

08:51.139 --> 08:52.857
Oh, w-well, he's right here.

08:52.858 --> 08:54.266
Let me just...
Wait a minute!

08:54.267 --> 08:56.119
We don't have phones or Chicago!

08:56.120 --> 08:57.704
All right, you got to die.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.914
Enough!
You three, out of my house!

08:59.915 --> 09:03.025
I will not play host
to some family feud!

09:13.120 --> 09:14.703
Out.

- Good answer! Good answer!
- Ah, good answer, good answer.

09:15.881 --> 09:16.956
Yeah, yeah, good answer.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.082

Hello.

09:26.007 --> 09:27.091
(bell clangs)

09:27.092 --> 09:29.152
- What?!
- I know this audience.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.553
Of course it was "hello."

09:30.554 --> 09:31.820
Of course it was.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.367
(harpsichord playing
"In Your Eyes")

09:44.118 --> 09:45.609
Romeo?

09:45.610 --> 09:47.778
- Juliet.
- (discordant notes play)

09:47.779 --> 09:49.464
I know I ain't
supposed to be here,

09:49.465 --> 09:51.532
but I just had to see you again.

09:51.533 --> 09:55.762
Oh, Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

09:55.763 --> 09:57.538
I... What-what...
what are you talking about?

09:57.539 --> 09:59.206
I'm right here.
You're looking right at me.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.584
You know what?
I'll come up there.

10:01.585 --> 10:03.085
- Romeo, we can't.
- (grunting)

10:03.086 --> 10:04.962
What if my father sees us?

10:04.963 --> 10:07.607
And "wherefore" means "why,"
by the way, not "where."

10:07.608 --> 10:08.966
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:08.967 --> 10:10.560
That's stupid. You're stupid.

10:10.561 --> 10:12.803
Juliet, I know we just met,

10:12.804 --> 10:15.973
but when I look at you,
I feel something special.

10:15.974 --> 10:19.661
This is gonna sound crazy,
but... will you marry me?

10:19.662 --> 10:22.313
Okay, let's do it.

10:22.314 --> 10:24.023
I love you, Romeo.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.042
I love you, too, Juliet.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.819
(both moaning)

10:28.820 --> 10:30.580
I should probably let you know

10:30.581 --> 10:32.748
I have a lot
of Jack Skellington tattoos.

10:32.749 --> 10:35.159
Well, I wish you would have
told me that before,

10:35.160 --> 10:39.139
but that's okay, because I do
karate outside against no one.

10:39.140 --> 10:43.058
Yeah, this is gonna be
a good marriage.

10:48.131 --> 10:49.899
There he is!

10:49.900 --> 10:52.259
There's the dumbass
I've been looking for.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.112

10:55.239 --> 10:57.732
(grunts) I could never say this

10:57.733 --> 11:00.100

11:00.101 --> 11:03.329

11:12.447 --> 11:15.824
I'm voiding my bowels right now
because I died,

11:15.825 --> 11:18.836
not 30 minutes ago
in the carriage on the way here.

11:18.837 --> 11:21.121
(grunting)

11:21.122 --> 11:21.847
(gasps)

11:23.083 --> 11:26.010
Welp, we all know how this goes.

11:26.011 --> 11:27.127
(siren whoops)

11:27.128 --> 11:28.812
I'm doin' it!

11:32.300 --> 11:33.926
Oh, Friar Laurence,

11:33.927 --> 11:36.738
are you absolutely sure
faking my death

11:36.739 --> 11:38.597
with this poison
is the best plan?

11:38.598 --> 11:41.517
Well, there's also Herbalife,
which is an amazing product.

11:41.518 --> 11:42.869
And I think you, specifically,

11:42.870 --> 11:44.853
would make a great addition
to our team.

11:44.854 --> 11:47.040
I-I'll take the poison.
Thank you, Friar.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.358
A-And since I'm picking up
a prescription,

11:49.359 --> 11:52.170
can I, uh, pay
for the rest of my items here?

11:52.171 --> 11:54.923
Uh, I-I guess.

11:54.924 --> 11:57.050
(annoyed sigh)

11:57.051 --> 11:59.259
Oh, (sighs) yourself.

12:03.707 --> 12:05.558
I'm afraid she's dead.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.385
You can tell
by her shallow breathing

12:07.386 --> 12:09.136
and weak but clear heartbeat.

12:09.137 --> 12:11.880
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.048
Can you make a paper airplane?

12:13.049 --> 12:14.258
I can.

12:14.259 --> 12:15.984
Then don't be so hard
on yourself.

12:20.482 --> 12:21.557
Oh, no!

12:21.558 --> 12:23.100
My girlfriend's dead!

12:23.101 --> 12:24.360
And on top of that,

12:24.361 --> 12:26.028
it's that time in late summer

12:26.029 --> 12:28.814
before football starts
and there's no basketball.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.200
I mean, there is baseball,
but it's not playoffs.

12:31.201 --> 12:34.086
I might as well just be dead!

12:36.382 --> 12:37.839
(coughs, choking)

12:40.002 --> 12:42.003
(weakly):
Children having sex,

12:42.004 --> 12:43.337
two murders,

12:43.338 --> 12:45.506
double suicide.

12:45.507 --> 12:48.667
Very irresponsible
to teach this...

12:48.668 --> 12:50.044

Oh, wherefore?

12:56.134 --> 12:57.551
Stupid.

12:57.552 --> 12:58.844
I don't understand.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.429
We had a plan!

13:00.430 --> 13:03.950
Did you think I was dead just
because I faked my own death?!

13:03.951 --> 13:05.943
Maybe there's still poison
on your lips.

13:05.944 --> 13:07.936
Mm. Alas.

13:07.937 --> 13:10.773
Just Costco hot dog.
(shudders)

13:10.774 --> 13:13.793
Well, a boy I knew
for three days is dead.

13:13.794 --> 13:17.005
And on top of that,
WNBA season is over,

13:17.006 --> 13:20.407

19:32.864 --> 19:34.948
It's happening.
It's happening.

19:34.949 --> 19:36.041
Dan, help!

19:36.042 --> 19:37.217
- Right.
- (grunting)

19:43.216 --> 19:44.925
You deserve to die,

19:44.926 --> 19:47.461
because the choices I made
are your fault!

19:47.462 --> 19:49.896
(muffled choking)

19:57.689 --> 19:59.931
All right.
She's mostly choked.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.784
Let's just sit on the floor
with our backs to the tub.

20:03.853 --> 20:05.896
(screams)

20:05.897 --> 20:07.080
(gunshot)

20:09.167 --> 20:12.494
It's just been revoked.

20:12.495 --> 20:14.462
¶ ¶

20:24.507 --> 20:25.591
Hi, I'm Chris Griffin.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.833
I didn't have
a lot to do tonight.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.318
But they did say
they'd give me one minute

20:28.319 --> 20:30.813
at the end of the show
to share my favorite love story.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.298
Of course, I chose
the classic romantic tale

20:33.299 --> 20:35.717
of the love between a young man
and pastry,

20:35.718 --> 20:37.385
<i>American Pie.</i>

20:37.386 --> 20:39.596
The store was all out of apple,

20:39.597 --> 20:41.223
so this one is chicken pot,

20:41.224 --> 20:42.908
fresh from the oven.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.151
Here we go.

20:44.152 --> 20:47.145
Ow, the piping hot gravy!

20:47.146 --> 20:49.731
Oh! And one of the peas
went inside!

20:49.732 --> 20:50.941
It's so burned,

20:50.942 --> 20:53.401
I can't tell what's chicken
and what's me!

20:53.402 --> 20:55.779
Oh, God!
Not gonna stop though!

20:55.780 --> 20:57.831
Happy anniversary, Mom and Dad,

20:57.832 --> 20:59.783
from your teenage son

20:59.784 --> 21:03.970
getting busy
with a 400-degree pot pie!
