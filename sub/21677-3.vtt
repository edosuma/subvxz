00:01.001 --> 00:03.035
-<i> Previously on "Below Deck"...</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:04.203
- Kate, Trevor,
senior deckhand.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.571
Trevor,
I'm senior deckhand.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.206
- Good to meet you, man.
- Senior deckhand.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.374
- "Hey, I'm Trevor,
I'm senior deckhand."

00:08.376 --> 00:09.875
- The other two deckhands
are having

00:09.877 --> 00:11.343
a little issue with Trevor.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.878
- He's your responsibility.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.614
If he becomes mine,
then you dropped the ball.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.549
- Nico, girlfriend back home?

00:17.551 --> 00:18.851
- I'm kind of with someone,

00:18.853 --> 00:20.252
but we just recently
started talking.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.787
- Okay, so it's just fresh.
- Yeah.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.389
- So you're talking to someone,
but not dating.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.390
- Yeah.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.758
- Should we soak our feet?

00:25.760 --> 00:27.359
-<i> There's no question like,</i>

00:27.361 --> 00:29.128
is this flirting,
is it not flirting?

00:29.130 --> 00:30.896
<i> It's so clear, finally.</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:32.131
- It's your job to do the toast.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.699
- Then just ask me
to do the toast.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.234
You don't really need to have
a temper tantrum

00:35.236 --> 00:36.969
like a 3-year-old
over a toaster.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.207
- Why don't you keep
your opinion to yourself?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.208
- You don't respect anybody.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.443
Go to bed, go.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.078
- Just go to bed.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.114
- Nico, I'd prefer if you
slept in the guest room.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.449
- This is f---ing bullsh--.

00:54.722 --> 01:01.760
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

01:23.683 --> 01:25.451
- Nothing, I'm staying
in the guest room.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.752
This guy's being an asshole.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.287
They had to separate us.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.189
And I was like,
I don't want any trouble.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.957
I told you,
like, since day one,

01:31.959 --> 01:33.625
I was gonna have problems
with him.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.861
I'm not gonna stay here
if he's here.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.596
I just started reconnecting

01:37.598 --> 01:39.898
with this girl that I know
since I was 16 years old.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.900
<i> And she's really supportive</i>
<i> of my job.</i>

01:41.902 --> 01:44.069
She obviously knows, like, it's
something that I've been doing

01:44.071 --> 01:45.471
and that I'm passionate about.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.441
- No, not at all.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.976
<i> Right now, talking with her,</i>
<i> I feel relieved,</i>

01:50.978 --> 01:53.579
and I feel like, you know,
she understands me.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.715
I'm not gonna work with this guy
that, on the free time,

01:56.717 --> 01:58.550
is taking personal jabs at me.

02:07.894 --> 02:10.395
- I've got to figure out
a way to reach Trevor.

02:10.397 --> 02:13.565
And I'm not sure how I'm gonna
communicate it to him yet,

02:13.567 --> 02:16.535
because I have to keep him
motivated on deck.

02:16.537 --> 02:20.639
Losing a man on the first
charter is not acceptable.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.579
- Are you hungry, Ems?

02:27.581 --> 02:29.615
- I found some breakfast,
but I'll be hungry in a bit.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.784
- Do you like smoked salmon?
- Love it.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.220
- Did you have fun last night?
- Yeah.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.356
- Just some people, I think,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.358
just had a little bit
too much to drink last night.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.592
-<i> What?</i>

02:40.594 --> 02:42.194
What did I miss?

02:42.196 --> 02:44.396
- Just a little situation,
but it's not a big deal.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.964
This is a team effort,

02:45.966 --> 02:48.367
and if one of the teammates
is being "that guy,"

02:48.369 --> 02:49.935
<i> then it interferes</i>
<i> with your work.</i>

02:49.937 --> 02:51.203
Yeah.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.644
-<i> Last night,</i>
<i> I was a little bit juiced up.</i>

02:58.646 --> 03:00.045
<i> We all were.</i>

03:00.047 --> 03:01.713
And I just happened
to make a comment

03:01.715 --> 03:04.516
that was completely harmless,

03:04.518 --> 03:06.351
<i> and now there's drama,</i>
<i> and I'm involved in it.</i>

03:06.353 --> 03:08.487
And it's like,
I'm the last person

03:08.489 --> 03:11.590
to f---ing get involved
in drama.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.325
- Have you guys done
any Asia traveling?

03:13.327 --> 03:14.560
- I've never been to Asia.
I'd love to go.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.894
- Thailand's amazing.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.763
One meal cost me
like 10 bucks.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.398
I was like,
well, this is amazing.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.799
- Good morning.

03:28.741 --> 03:29.875
- Trevor f---ed up.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.510
<i> He got wasted, ran his mouth.</i>

03:31.512 --> 03:33.845
When you start crossing
personal boundaries,

03:33.847 --> 03:36.515
even on your off-time,
that's not gonna fly.

03:42.957 --> 03:44.289
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

03:44.291 --> 03:46.158
- Hi, how's it going?

03:48.861 --> 03:50.762
- Did you do the twin yet?
- Yeah, the twin's done.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.064
- Someone slept in it?

03:52.066 --> 03:54.399
- Yeah, Nico slept in it
last night.

03:54.401 --> 03:59.037
Trevor got a little bit...
wordy in the Jacuzzi.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.038
- Oh.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.306
Trevor's sweet,

04:01.308 --> 04:03.809
<i> but his energy</i>
<i> is slightly unsettled.</i>

04:03.811 --> 04:07.346
He's a bit like a cat
on a hot tin roof.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.347
- Ow.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.485
Awesome day,
awesome f---ing day.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.053
- I thought he seemed
a bit off this morning.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.423
- Yeah, he's probably
embarrassed.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.094
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

04:22.096 --> 04:24.162
- How was sleeping
in the guest quarters, huh?

04:24.164 --> 04:26.665
- I was popping champagne
bottles with my feet up.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.899
- Where was my invite?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.701
- You knew where I was.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.570
-<i> Nico and I, I feel like</i>
<i> we're on the same page.</i>

04:31.572 --> 04:33.772
<i> We have exactly the same,</i>
<i> you know, personality type.</i>

04:33.774 --> 04:35.340
Someone that has
that same mind-set

04:35.342 --> 04:36.908
is already a breath
of fresh air.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.210
It's like, all right, thank God.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.678
Were you hungover?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.380
- I wasn't hungover,
but I was just like,

04:41.382 --> 04:43.515
how did that even,
like, come about?

04:43.517 --> 04:44.916
We're all having fun
in the Jacuzzi,

04:44.918 --> 04:46.451
and the first thing he said
was like,

04:46.453 --> 04:48.553
"Oh, yeah, your tattoos
are so faded," this and that.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.522
And I was just like,
"Why are you saying anything?

04:50.524 --> 04:51.857
"I don't care
about your opinion.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.258
It's my body."

04:53.260 --> 04:54.760
- Yeah, it's like
a personal insult

04:54.762 --> 04:56.361
that's got nothing
to do with anything.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.963
- I don't want
to stir any sh-- up,

04:57.965 --> 05:00.699
especially with
someone I work with.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.067
- I feel like you're
the same as me.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.402
Like, nothing
really rattles you.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.803
You know, it sort of bounces
off you,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.738
but if you snap,
you f---ing snap.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.040
- Yeah.
- You know?

05:08.042 --> 05:09.441
- Absolutely.

05:11.144 --> 05:16.415
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

05:16.417 --> 05:18.984
- Oh, my God, Kate.
- Yeah?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.753
- I just opened it.
- Oh, my God.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.656
- Sierra left it in.
- Oh, God.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.026
- This is still wet,
and this is hot.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.663
I've never had
a burnt sheet before.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.165
I did stress the importance

05:33.167 --> 05:34.766
of always
turning an iron off.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.735
Just so you know,
the roller iron was still on.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.570
Just turn it off.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.339
It's like when you go
to your grandparents' house,

05:40.341 --> 05:42.941
and on the back of the door,
they have, in needlepoint,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.509
"Did you turn off the oven?"

05:44.511 --> 05:46.411
We need one of those for Sierra.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.779
We're not gonna get mad at her,

05:47.781 --> 05:50.849
but we just need this
to not happen again.

05:52.853 --> 05:57.255
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

05:57.257 --> 05:59.224
- Kate, Ben, Kelley,
I need you guys

05:59.226 --> 06:01.960
<i> down in the crew mess</i>
<i> for prepping sheet meeting.</i>

06:01.962 --> 06:04.563
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.531
- So charter number two.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.167
We have some yachties.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.535
Two of them own yachts.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.471
We have Dave and Jodi Mailer,

06:12.473 --> 06:15.040
Robert Gelmeyer
and Douglas Wolff,

06:15.042 --> 06:16.308
who are a couple,

06:16.310 --> 06:17.542
and then we have Scupper.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.044
Appears to be a French poodle.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.046
Ground red meat and lamb.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.148
- Is that what they're into?
- That's what the dog is into.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.150
- Fluffy little f---er.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.419
<i> I'm not absolutely thrilled</i>
<i>about having to cook for a dog.</i>

06:27.421 --> 06:29.087
<i> I grew up with dogs,</i>

06:29.089 --> 06:32.724
and they were pretty okay
just eating out of a can.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.092
- If their dog's name
is Scupper,

06:34.094 --> 06:35.160
they're real yachties.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.495
- Yeah.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.563
Jodi doesn't eat
red meat or pork.

06:38.565 --> 06:42.067
They want to do a clambake
on the beach for dinner.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.268
Knowing how
you love doing that.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.003
- Oh, I just love them.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.405
- We're gonna go
to Virgin Gorda.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.107
We're gonna dock up
at Leverick Bay.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.742
We got a critter-free
pool coming.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.943
- Oh, is that the one
with the nets?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.245
- It's the net, yeah.
- Okay.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.513
- Goes behind the boat.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.748
A critter-free pool
is a 20x40 pool,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.850
<i> and it has a net</i>
<i> to keep all the jellyfish out.</i>

06:58.852 --> 07:00.585
It's a dog and pony show.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.354
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

07:02.356 --> 07:05.056
- Sierra, did you see
what happened?

07:06.659 --> 07:07.859
- How did this happen?

07:07.861 --> 07:09.361
Because it was left on it?

07:09.363 --> 07:10.562
Because it was hot?

07:10.564 --> 07:11.797
So is it burned?

07:11.799 --> 07:13.565
It's easy to forget, like...

07:13.567 --> 07:14.900
- I think it's burned through.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.401
It was really hot
and crisp earlier.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.469
- Oh, no.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.470
I mean, it's confusing.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.838
I don't know.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
- Happened to us as well,
so don't worry.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.375
- Bummer.

07:23.377 --> 07:29.581
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

07:29.583 --> 07:32.250
- What do you think
you're gonna make for lunch?

07:32.252 --> 07:35.187
- We're gonna do a nine-course
tasting menu for the dog.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.888
- We could just take
all the leftovers

07:36.890 --> 07:38.690
from the crew food
and give that to the guests

07:38.692 --> 07:40.325
so you can focus on the dog.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.927
- Why don't we actually
just have the guests

07:41.929 --> 07:43.161
eat with the crew?

07:43.163 --> 07:45.263
So then we can just
give the dog

07:45.265 --> 07:49.100
our undivided attention.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.502
Hey.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.270
- What is the beach clambake?
Is that dinner?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.206
- I was thinking we could
take an early dinner,

07:54.208 --> 07:55.607
like 4:30 to 6:30,

07:55.609 --> 07:57.509
'cause the sun goes down
at 6:30,

07:57.511 --> 08:00.111
and then all of the sand fleas
and mosquitoes and stuff

08:00.113 --> 08:01.379
will be out in force.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.114
- That's an extremely
early dinner.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.183
- Gets dark early.
- That's gonna be two dinners.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.952
- 'Cause then they're
gonna eat again.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.286
- 'Cause then they're gonna want
to eat at 10:00 again.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.554
- I'm just letting you guys know

08:09.556 --> 08:11.323
what it's gonna be
like out there.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.958
- I'm a little perturbed.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.529
A 4:30 clambake on the beach
screws my day up.

08:17.531 --> 08:21.800
I'm unclear how this evening
is going to unravel.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.003
I think we should say
the clambake's an early dinner,

08:25.005 --> 08:27.038
and then we can--
and then we'll roll and--

08:27.040 --> 08:29.474
and then we'll spoil them.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.076
- I'm just gonna call it
"clambake."

08:31.078 --> 08:33.512
- Just say
an "early dinner clambake."

08:33.514 --> 08:35.080
- I'm just saying "clambake."

08:37.751 --> 08:39.184
- Trevor, Trevor,
this is Kelley.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.852
<i> Meeting in the swim platform.</i>

08:40.854 --> 08:42.420
- No problem.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.727
- Come on down.

08:48.729 --> 08:52.697
Last night...

08:52.699 --> 08:54.699
is unacceptable,
period, end of story.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.867
Unacceptable.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.035
You, as of right now,

08:57.037 --> 08:58.937
are no longer a senior deckhand.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.405
You will not boss them around.

09:00.407 --> 09:04.042
You will not basically
say sh-- to anybody.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.378
Your job is to f---ing clean,

09:06.380 --> 09:09.047
make sure everything's
getting done, and that's it.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.482
- Yes, sir.

09:10.484 --> 09:11.816
You can try to demote me,

09:11.818 --> 09:13.818
but you're not
gonna get me down,

09:13.820 --> 09:16.054
<i> and you're not gonna deplete</i>
<i> my knowledge of my position.</i>

09:16.056 --> 09:18.189
- If I see anything happen,
I will push to have you gone.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.457
- Yes, sir.

09:19.459 --> 09:23.161
- All right,
go get back to work.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.796
- F---.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.666
- This is Scupper.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.367
- You and I are gonna have
lots of fun.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.503
-<i> The dog gets treated better</i>

09:31.505 --> 09:34.673
than 90% of the children
in the United States.

09:34.675 --> 09:35.941
- Scupper can't hold his liquor.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.615
- You've never been to London,
have you?

09:43.617 --> 09:45.517
- Mm-mm, do you have a place?

09:45.519 --> 09:48.453
- Now when I go back,
I stay with my mom,

09:48.455 --> 09:50.422
and I visit my dad.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.023
Are your parents together?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.091
- No.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.793
- Are they divorced,
or...

09:54.795 --> 09:57.295
- My dad passed away
when I was 16.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.464
- 16, and you moved out
after that?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.132
- Yeah.
- Was it a shock?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.367
- No, he was sick.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.969
- Aw.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.372
- It was really hard for us
when my dad passed away.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.541
<i> It actually kind of like</i>

10:09.543 --> 10:11.376
<i> separated my family</i>
<i> a little bit,</i>

10:11.378 --> 10:14.613
because everyone's grief
was so intense.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.015
It was kind of hard
to connect at that point.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.352
- What was wrong with him?

10:20.354 --> 10:22.354
- With his passing,
I was kind of lost,

10:22.356 --> 10:24.789
and I went through life
kind of searching for something.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.725
And I think with yachting,
I found it.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.393
But we'll see.

10:28.395 --> 10:32.464
- You don't have to talk
about it, don't worry.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.832
- Yeah, I'd rather not.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.567
- Okay, of course.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.337
<i> - Morning, Captain.</i>
<i> - What's up?</i>

10:39.339 --> 10:41.573
- I kind of wanted to give you
a rundown of last night,

10:41.575 --> 10:45.510
'cause Trevor just
is a big, big problem.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.479
It got to the point
where I had to send him to bed.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.813
- Did you talk to him today?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.315
- Yes, I did talk to him
today.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.916
I basically told him
he was demoted

10:51.918 --> 10:54.152
and he's no longer
senior deckhand.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.654
-<i> Kelley handled it very well.</i>

10:55.656 --> 10:57.222
<i> From what I see so far,</i>

10:57.224 --> 10:59.924
I like the way Kelley
is attacking his job.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.527
You deal with it.
- Roger that. Will do.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.995
<i> Thank you, Captain.</i>

11:03.997 --> 11:06.831
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

11:06.833 --> 11:07.832
-<i> Attention, deck crew.</i>

11:07.834 --> 11:09.601
I need everybody out here

11:09.603 --> 11:12.704
<i> to assist with the delivery</i>
<i> we got coming on board.</i>

11:12.706 --> 11:14.973
Oh, sh--, it's the pool.

11:17.978 --> 11:23.114
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

11:23.116 --> 11:26.017
- Holy f--- balls.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.452
- Thanks.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.120
- Go ahead and take it
out of the bag for now.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.522
- Ready?
- Yep.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.891
- One, two, three.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.659
- Oh, sh--.

11:34.661 --> 11:37.362
- That's a friggin'
heavy pool.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.398
- It's a big joint.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.003
Ah! F---, that hurt!

11:45.005 --> 11:47.672
- Well done, guys.
-       - Yeah.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.908
-<i> Attention all crew,</i>
<i> in five minutes,</i>

11:49.910 --> 11:51.910
<i> I need everybody</i>
<i> on the aft deck.</i>

11:53.679 --> 11:55.980
Come on, ladies.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.582
- Look at that. Nice.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.918
-<i> Ben, I got them walking</i>
<i> down the dock.</i>

11:59.920 --> 12:01.986
<i> Get your ass out here now.</i>

12:01.988 --> 12:03.722
<i>They're walking up the gangway.</i>

12:06.425 --> 12:07.992
- Hello.
- Hi!

12:07.994 --> 12:09.127
- Hi.
- Captain Lee.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.328
- Pleasure.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.097
- Hey, Captain Lee,
great to see you.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.198
- Good to meet you.
Douglas.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.599
This is Scupper.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.768
- You and I are gonna have
lots of fun.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.769
- Hi, Nico.

12:17.771 --> 12:18.937
These people love yachting.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.338
<i> This is not just guests</i>

12:20.340 --> 12:22.173
where we can get away
with a few things.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.676
We really need to make sure
that we don't mess anything up.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.711
- Welcome aboard the "Valor."
- Thank you.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.279
- Kate will show you
to your quarters

12:28.281 --> 12:29.681
and give you a tour
of the boat,

12:29.683 --> 12:30.615
and we'll start having
a good time.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.450
- Cheers, thank you all.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.119
- Hi, guys, we'll go
in the main salon first.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.787
- Oh, this is lovely.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.990
- It's a very modern boat.
- It sure is, great job.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.625
- What size boats
do y'all have?

12:40.627 --> 12:42.193
- We have a 55 Azimut.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.194
- Oh, yeah.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.629
- We have a 70 Hatteras.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.898
- And we dock
a Grey Poupon bottle toss

12:46.900 --> 12:47.899
away from each other.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.901
- Oh, I like that saying.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.137
<i> - We'll go to the sun deck,</i>
<i> which is the very fun level.</i>

12:52.139 --> 12:53.905
It's got a nice Jacuzzi
with a good view.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.406
- Oh, nice.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.575
- And now we'll go
down to the guest quarters.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.644
He's like a little baby,
hugging him.

12:59.646 --> 13:02.280
<i> I'm pretty sure</i>
<i> the dog gets treated better</i>

13:02.282 --> 13:06.518
than 90% of the children
in the United States.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.919
- Everybody in position?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.354
- Yes, sir,
everybody's in position.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.355
-<i> Bow to stern.</i>

13:10.357 --> 13:15.260
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

13:15.262 --> 13:17.762
- Hey, good job.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.364
- She's coming out.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.667
- Nico, let us know
when all lines are in.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.369
-<i> Okay, Cap,</i>
<i> all lines are clear.</i>

13:24.371 --> 13:25.970
- Perfect.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.139
- No traffic astern, Captain,
no traffic astern.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.942
- Hey, great job.
That went smooth as buttah.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.144
- Smooth as a baby's bum.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.679
- He has a tuxedo.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.181
- Oh!

13:36.183 --> 13:37.715
- Maybe we could just
steam it a little bit.

13:37.717 --> 13:38.950
- Of course, yep.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.252
What a lucky pup.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.794
-<i> Guys, what's the plan like?</i>

13:49.796 --> 13:50.995
<i> Are we gonna go</i>
<i> to the beach, or--</i>

13:50.997 --> 13:52.530
- Perfect timing.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.499
We were originally thinking
around 4:00, 4:30

13:54.501 --> 13:55.500
for the clambake.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.501
But how hungry are you?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.735
Can you wait till 4:00?

13:57.737 --> 13:59.337
- Whatever--yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.905
- Okay, good, good.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.273
- No stress on him.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.608
- No!
- Yeah!

14:03.610 --> 14:05.009
- He cooks his best
when he's...

14:05.011 --> 14:06.144
-<i> Yes, mellow.</i>

14:07.848 --> 14:11.850
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

14:11.852 --> 14:14.752
-<i> Deck crew, let's get ready for</i>
<i> a starboard side tie, please.</i>

14:14.754 --> 14:16.254
-<i> Roger that.</i>

14:16.256 --> 14:18.823
<i> - Okay, it's gonna be</i>
<i> starboard too.</i>

14:18.825 --> 14:22.660
A lot of boat
in a small marina.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.095
- It's a bitch of a wind.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.864
- What's the distance
on my port side?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.031
-<i> 80 feet and closing.</i>

14:27.033 --> 14:28.967
- That is way too small a dock.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.802
-<i> We're going into</i>
<i> a really small marina,</i>

14:30.804 --> 14:33.371
<i> and the wind is blowing</i>
<i> the boat off the dock,</i>

14:33.373 --> 14:34.772
<i> so the deck crew are really</i>

14:34.774 --> 14:36.307
gonna have to keep
their head in the game.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.976
- What do you think, Scupper?

14:37.978 --> 14:40.712
- The situation, this is like
driving a giant sail.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.449
That's why he's coming in
cockeyed like this.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.151
- Run that stern line all
the way back, one more cleat.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.387
Take up on it right away,
let's go.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.890
- Yep--here we go.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.625
- Barry's got the bow.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.463
- The bow is good, you're in.
- He knows his stuff.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.697
<i> It's not his first time</i>
<i> at the rodeo.</i>

14:59.699 --> 15:01.499
- Nice job, deckhands,
thank you.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.402
-<i> Deck crew, deck crew, grab</i>
<i> all the beach picnic supplies,</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:07.605
<i> and load them in the tender.</i>

15:07.607 --> 15:09.807
- Sierra, I'm gonna
put you in charge

15:09.809 --> 15:11.976
of collecting these items.
- Okay.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.278
- And then, Emily,
if you'll just stay

15:13.280 --> 15:14.512
on service checking
on the guests?

15:14.514 --> 15:15.413
Thank you.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.781
- I like beaches.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.450
Please don't get
your nose full of sand.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.585
- Which beach are we going to?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.153
- Right over there.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.157
Watch that f---ing rebar.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.992
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:27.994 --> 15:29.460
- Oh.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.429
- Scupper can't hold his liquor.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.998
- We need some towels.
- It's not a big deal.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.466
Just Scupper threw up.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.001
- Okay, Scupper,
say you're sorry.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.670
- Thank you, Emily,
do you want us to do that?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.471
- Oh, no, no, don't worry.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.340
Providing excellent service

15:42.342 --> 15:44.475
means providing excellent
service for everyone,

15:44.477 --> 15:45.543
including Scupper.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.811
- Kisses?

15:46.813 --> 15:53.351
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:53.353 --> 15:55.453
- I don't understand
why Captain Lee

15:55.455 --> 15:57.021
said we had to do this
party so early.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.057
I don't feel like
there's any bugs here.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.959
-<i> Hey, do you want me to go</i>
<i> pick them up now?</i>

16:00.961 --> 16:02.260
- Yeah, I think the guests
are just getting ready,

16:02.262 --> 16:04.228
so you can be
on standby there.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.496
-<i> Roger that.</i>

16:09.802 --> 16:11.135
- Look how nice.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.905
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

16:13.907 --> 16:15.840
- Just grab one side,
perfect.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.309
It's a heavy f---er.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.111
- All right,
three, two, one.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.813
- No, don't throw it.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.014
Okay, good.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.282
- We're gonna play with the dog.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.918
- Here's the diet tonic.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.619
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.656
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.693
- Take the handle,

16:35.695 --> 16:38.496
and we're gonna just hoof it
over to that station.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.265
- Let me know when.
- Okay, go.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.800
- Let me know...
- Nice job, thank you.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.535
That was easy.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.372
F---ing hell, where the hell
did these flies come from?

16:47.374 --> 16:48.673
- Kate, you know
what I was thinking?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.274
Could we push dinner
to 9:00?

16:50.276 --> 16:52.210
- Yes, of course,
'cause this is a late meal.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.012
- We're not gonna be hungry.
- Yeah.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.179
- Perfect, I love it.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.814
It's gonna be a great time.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.883
- Okay, Sierra,
you go with that.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.819
I can get more flies
by the time you come back.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.821
- Pardon me, guys.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.090
And here...

17:06.092 --> 17:07.959
There you are.
- Wow, look at that.

17:07.961 --> 17:10.061
- There's a lobster tail
for everyone.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.665
- Okay, guys,
these are spiny lobster tails.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.668
I'm so sorry
about the flies, gosh.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.604
<i> - These flies are like,</i>
<i> you've never seen a lobster</i>

17:19.606 --> 17:20.938
<i> and a clambake before?</i>

17:20.940 --> 17:23.508
<i> Jesus!</i>

17:23.510 --> 17:26.277
- Very good.
- Okay, brilliant.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.312
- What time is it now?
- 10 to 6:00.

17:28.314 --> 17:32.617
And they said that they
would like to push dinner back.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.685
- But whoever mentioned dinner?

17:34.687 --> 17:36.187
- I don't know.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.955
- And you didn't call this
an early dinner?

17:37.957 --> 17:40.191
- I don't think if I called it
the last meal of your life,

17:40.193 --> 17:42.593
that would prevent them
from becoming hungry later.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.529
Three things you encounter
in life:

17:44.531 --> 17:45.997
death, taxes,

17:45.999 --> 17:48.666
and Ben getting angry
when asked to cook food.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.468
- We always said
this was a late dinner.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.036
It's 6:00, right?

17:52.038 --> 17:53.704
6:00's dinner time.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.607
- I think that you're getting
prematurely aggravated.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.476
- No, I'm not, actually.
- Okay, good.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.710
- It's just
when people don't listen to me,

17:59.712 --> 18:01.112
this is what happens.

18:01.114 --> 18:05.083
"Yes, Chef,"
is not part of her vocabulary.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.786
- In case they come up to me
and start talking about dinner,

18:08.788 --> 18:10.388
which is what
they are calling it...

18:10.390 --> 18:11.622
- We're doing tapas.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.224
You gonna communicate it
with the guests?

18:13.226 --> 18:14.659
- I am, but not while they're
eating their dessert.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.660
- Perfect, I just wanted
to make sure.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.828
- Okay, great, yeah.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.396
And would you like
to know what time?

18:18.398 --> 18:19.397
- Hey, Kelley, come in,
it's Ben, please.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.399
Can I get a pickup, please?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.568
-<i> Roger that, I'll be</i>
<i> leaving in just a sec.</i>

18:23.570 --> 18:24.669
- All right, thank you.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.270
- Such a diva.

18:26.272 --> 18:30.007
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

18:30.009 --> 18:31.509
- Get the f--- over yourself,
man.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.177
Go back to the Marine Corps
or something.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.313
- Just let it go.
- No, I'm not letting it go.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.383
- Kelley, Kelley, come in,
it's Ben, please.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.551
Can I get a pickup, please?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.687
-<i> Roger that, I'll be leaving</i>
<i> in just a sec.</i>

18:42.689 --> 18:44.789
- Here, and you can take
this back with you.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.691
- Kate, you have four people
here, all right?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.392
Sort it out.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.561
Cheers, guys,
I'll see you later.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.965
- Okay.
No, we're good, we're good.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.666
- Yeah, I need to go back
to the boat, though,

18:55.668 --> 18:56.901
'cause I got to feed the crew.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.236
- What was that about?

18:58.238 --> 19:00.071
- He's just having
a diva moment,

19:00.073 --> 19:01.772
because he feels like
he's gonna have to cook more,

19:01.774 --> 19:04.809
but that's kind of the job.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.614
- Kate refuses to communicate
with the guests,

19:09.616 --> 19:10.915
and now the guests still think

19:10.917 --> 19:12.617
that they're having
a sit-down dinner.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.019
And it's like, you know,
this should have been discussed

19:15.021 --> 19:16.487
hours ago with them.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.189
Most people
are actually afraid of Kate,

19:18.191 --> 19:20.258
<i> but I'm not afraid of anyone.</i>

19:20.260 --> 19:22.860
<i> We're obviously going through</i>
<i> a power struggle right now,</i>

19:22.862 --> 19:26.197
and I'm not gonna back down,
because I'm setting a precedent

19:26.199 --> 19:28.332
<i> for the rest</i>
<i> of the charter season.</i>

19:30.102 --> 19:31.502
- Are you all done here?
- Yes.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.237
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

19:34.806 --> 19:36.340
- That's what they
were fighting about.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.843
- Kelley, Kelley, Kate.
-<i> Go ahead for Kelley.</i>

19:38.845 --> 19:40.678
- I think the guests and I are
ready to go back to the boat.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.947
-<i> All right, I'm on my way.</i>

19:42.949 --> 19:45.116
- Whenever you guys are ready,
the tender is on standby.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.217
- Hello!

19:46.219 --> 19:47.818
- Can you grab some butter

19:47.820 --> 19:48.819
out of that fridge?

19:48.821 --> 19:49.887
- Thank you.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.658
- What are you doing?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.059
- I'm prepping dog food
right now.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.395
Please don't disturb.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.830
- Can you please tell me
what you'd like to serve

19:59.832 --> 20:01.132
so I can sell it to them?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.366
- This is what
is gonna happen.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.901
I'm gonna talk to the guests,

20:03.903 --> 20:06.037
because clearly you are
terrible at it, thank you.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.139
- Is this your first charter?

20:08.141 --> 20:10.141
<i> - I've known Kate</i>
<i> for many years,</i>

20:10.143 --> 20:13.711
and when she starts
putting up resistance,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.980
I have to take matters
into my own hands.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.418
- Can you radio to Kate

20:20.420 --> 20:23.154
to have Kelley
bring more bags?

20:23.156 --> 20:24.722
- Kelley, Kelley, Trevor.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.891
Hey, man, bring some trash bags
back when you come back

20:26.893 --> 20:29.260
to help us break down.

20:29.262 --> 20:33.531
-<i> You mean,</i>
<i>"Bring the trash bags, please"?</i>

20:33.533 --> 20:36.734
- Okay, well, bring
trash bags back, please?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.703
Get the f--- over yourself,
man.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.371
Go back to the Marine Corps
or something.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.373
- All we need to do is just say
please and thank you.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.041
- I said, "Hey, can I get
some trash bags?"

20:44.043 --> 20:46.010
Demoted or not, I know I have
way more experience

20:46.012 --> 20:48.546
than any of the other deckhands,
including Kelley.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.681
And I think I should
be respected for all that.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.084
Like, I could
totally be boatswain.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.752
- But, I mean,
it's that attitude

20:54.754 --> 20:56.287
that's obviously
pissing him off.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.788
- That's not my attitude,
though.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.991
I go about everything
his way for anything.

20:59.993 --> 21:01.892
- Just let it go.
- No, I'm not letting it go.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.694
I'm gonna f---ing lose it
tonight, I guarantee it.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.730
- Hey, guys, how are you?
- Not too bad.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.733
- Good, so it's completely
up to you.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.002
I just felt like,
at this point in the evening,

21:11.004 --> 21:13.404
you might not want, like,
a serious formal dinner.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.339
It might be more fun to roll

21:15.341 --> 21:17.208
with some exciting
tapas options.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.676
-<i> This is embarrassing.</i>

21:18.678 --> 21:20.244
<i> Ben is trying to do my job.</i>

21:20.246 --> 21:22.647
He is being a total dick.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.081
- That'd be great.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.916
- So what time would you
like that, do you think?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.184
- 9:00-ish.
- 9:00 work for you?

21:27.186 --> 21:28.819
- Yeah, that's brilliant.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.187
What's your favorite food?

21:30.189 --> 21:31.656
I want to make sure
he's happy.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.426
- Well, mine is turkey bacon.
- Is it?

21:35.428 --> 21:37.728
- I would say
that's my favorite.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.263
- Okay, absolutely perfect.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.831
Enough said, thank you so much.
- Got it?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.233
- Take care.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.268
- Thanks, Kate.
- My pleasure.

21:44.270 --> 21:51.042
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

21:51.044 --> 21:53.077
- Kate, you saw me
getting stressed earlier

21:53.079 --> 21:55.046
'cause I didn't know
what was going on.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.715
Three hours later, I still
didn't know what was going on.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.884
- My ultimate goal in asking you
what you planned on making--

21:59.886 --> 22:02.620
"Do you guys
want a relaxed tapas

22:02.622 --> 22:03.821
"kind of informal thing,

22:03.823 --> 22:05.156
or do you want
a sit-down dinner?"

22:05.158 --> 22:06.490
Three hours ago,
I wanted that answer.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.558
- Whoa.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.659
- And you were just
buying time.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.461
- All I've got is time.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.864
All I've got on this boat
is a bunch of time on this boat.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.733
- Something happened;
they were fighting.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.234
- I'm not like you,
I'm not like,

22:17.236 --> 22:18.969
"I don't feel like
working past 9:00."

22:18.971 --> 22:21.539
- I don't feel like that.
What?

22:21.541 --> 22:23.708
Oh, now you're trying
to label me as lazy.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.710
- I don't know what your problem
right now is.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.913
- My problem is, is communicate
with the guests,

22:28.915 --> 22:31.015
or I'm gonna communicate
instead.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.049
That's my problem.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.018
- I communicated tapas.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.386
- If they're arguing
like that,

22:35.388 --> 22:37.822
make sure the door
to the galley is closed.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.156
- You don't know
what communication is.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.424
- Don't I?

22:40.426 --> 22:41.592
I think I communicated
very well with them.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.060
- Oh, selectively.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.562
- At least I got
definitive answers from them.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.397
- I wanted definitive answers
from you.

22:46.399 --> 22:50.267
- Well, that was the problem,
wasn't it?

22:50.269 --> 22:51.836
- Want it downstairs now?

22:51.838 --> 22:53.604
- No, we're gonna do,
if we can,

22:53.606 --> 22:55.172
without making a mess
with the chef,

22:55.174 --> 22:57.241
we want to do his dinner.
- Sure.

22:59.277 --> 23:00.544
- Hello.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.279
- Chef Ben,
are you ready for me?

23:02.281 --> 23:04.014
- There's no time
like the present.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.716
Here we go.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.819
- I'm just finishing up
the dog's supplements.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.488
Have you ever seen a dog
need so many vitamins?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.790
- That dog's probably
healthier than I am.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.393
- He's never had brown rice,
but I'm sure he'll love it.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.165
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:21.167 --> 23:23.067
And then the Scupper
is good to go.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.201
Thank you, Chef.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.537
Boy, look at this.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.538
There you go.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.342
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:31.344 --> 23:34.311
- All right, what is the most
efficient way to do this?

23:34.313 --> 23:35.880
- Unload it all,
and then...

23:35.882 --> 23:37.581
- Should we unload it
to the side there, and then--

23:40.919 --> 23:42.586
- That's what she was saying.

23:42.588 --> 23:43.754
Come here, Trevor, come here.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.256
Come on, let's go.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.924
- Oh, my God,
this is so annoying.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.727
- I'm tired of getting
chewed out for everything.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.162
You're making me look horrible.

23:51.164 --> 23:52.596
- You're making yourself
look bad.

23:52.598 --> 23:53.898
- I feel undermined as f---
by you.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.166
- No, you're not
being undermined.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.367
I'm your f---ing boss.

23:56.369 --> 23:58.235
- Really?
I'm busting my ass, man.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.204
- Dude, everybody's busting
their f---ing ass, everybody.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.806
What, you think
you're f---ing special?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.040
You're the only problem
that I have,

24:03.042 --> 24:04.542
and everybody sees it.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.877
I tried being nice to him,
but at this point,

24:06.879 --> 24:08.379
Mr. Nice Boatswain is gone.

24:08.381 --> 24:09.814
I'm just tired of excuses.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.049
Just say, "My bad,
next time we got it."

24:12.051 --> 24:19.089
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:20.892 --> 24:22.827
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes, please.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.228
- Sure, gin and tonic?

24:24.230 --> 24:25.696
- Diet, if you have it.
- Absolutely.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.331
- Thank you.
You look so pretty.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.166
- Thank you so much.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.568
Did you want alcohol?

24:30.570 --> 24:32.136
- That would be the gin part.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.137
- Oh, okay.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.472
- Okay, thank you.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.641
- You ready, little man?
- Come on, man.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.676
- Come on, bud.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.244
- Well, how pretty is this?

24:40.246 --> 24:42.079
- Look how beautiful you are.
- Thank you.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.514
- We're about ready
for dinner, right?

24:43.516 --> 24:45.349
- Yeah, I think so.
- That would be perfect.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.717
- Okay.
- Thank you, Kate.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.220
- What do you think
is the time, Ben,

24:49.222 --> 24:50.588
until I can
bring a platter out?

24:50.590 --> 24:51.822
- You didn't say
they were at the table.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.157
- They're ready to eat,

24:53.159 --> 24:54.225
so if you want
to put it on platters,

24:54.227 --> 24:55.659
great, let's do it.

24:55.661 --> 24:59.330
- Turkey bacon, crab cake,
truffle sauce.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.498
- Okay, thanks.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.166
So first, we have a crab cake

25:02.168 --> 25:04.368
with a truffle
remoulade sauce.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.769
And this is the turkey bacon.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.771
- I knew I smelled
the turkey bacon.

25:07.773 --> 25:10.441
- The food is really good.
- Oh, God, yeah.

25:10.443 --> 25:12.243
- Very good.
- Good.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.179
- Are they liking?

25:15.181 --> 25:17.281
- I don't hover over them while
they take their first bite,

25:17.283 --> 25:18.682
but I'll keep you posted.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.051
- Okay, hon, like
just a..."Yes, they like it."

25:21.053 --> 25:23.120
- I will let you know.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.955
- As long as they're not
throwing it over the side

25:24.957 --> 25:26.290
at this point, it's okay.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.691
- I don't know,
they might be.

25:27.693 --> 25:31.996
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

25:31.998 --> 25:33.397
- F---ing hell.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.133
- Now we have a seared tuna

25:36.135 --> 25:37.668
with a truffle balsamic glaze.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.004
- He must have been
real pissed at you, Kate.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.005
- How could you tell?

25:41.007 --> 25:42.540
- Exactly.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.308
- I mean, you guys
only have two nights.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.709
I don't fault you at all

25:45.711 --> 25:47.645
for wanting to have
a nice sit-down dinner.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.413
I'm more than tired of this.

25:49.415 --> 25:53.250
Have I spoiled Ben too much
by being, like, accommodating?

25:53.252 --> 25:56.020
Now, for dessert, we have
a deconstructed blueberry pie.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.655
- Oh, there you go.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.590
- What we want you to do now is,
we want you to go in

25:59.592 --> 26:01.759
and tell him we want
a full breakfast at 6:00 a.m.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.029
- Eggs Benedict.
- He hates that, right?

26:05.031 --> 26:07.298
- He needs to learn a lesson
like a toddler.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.832
Like, he needs
to be put in time-out.

26:08.834 --> 26:12.770
He clearly has lost sight
of how to behave.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.271
- Great job, little man.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.606
- Scuffer,
we're going this way.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.074
- Good night.
- Good night.

26:19.110 --> 26:22.646
- This has been one of the most
exhausting days of my life,

26:22.648 --> 26:24.381
mentally and physically.

26:24.383 --> 26:27.017
<i>Kate's been a bloody nightmare,</i>

26:27.019 --> 26:29.186
and I'm really over it
right now.

26:29.188 --> 26:33.524
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:36.128 --> 26:38.062
Breakfast is at 9:00.

26:38.064 --> 26:41.699
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:41.701 --> 26:43.567
- You guys want me
to take one with you?

26:43.569 --> 26:45.169
I can cheers one with you
if it's the last night.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.204
Fair winds
and following seas.

26:50.976 --> 26:57.915
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:03.355 --> 27:04.955
- Attention all deck crew,

27:04.957 --> 27:06.190
let's get ready
for departure.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.858
- Roger that.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.393
- We got to get the gangway in.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.428
I'm gonna go to the bow.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.132
- Nice morning.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.467
- Go down a little bit
more your way.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.469
- See that spacer on top?

27:18.471 --> 27:20.204
- Let me know
when everybody's in position

27:20.206 --> 27:21.905
so we can get
out of here, Kelley.

27:21.907 --> 27:23.540
-<i> On the bow, waiting to go.</i>

27:23.542 --> 27:25.075
-<i> Roger that, Captain.</i>

27:25.077 --> 27:27.144
- Why the f--- did he radio
over the f--- mic?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.879
- Who?
- Trevor.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.414
- Once that's in,
go ahead and get your lines.

27:30.416 --> 27:31.448
- All right.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.283
-<i> We're good.</i>

27:33.285 --> 27:35.586
- All right, let's start
with this, bow to stern.

27:35.588 --> 27:38.155
- Roger, bow to stern.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.289
-<i> Bow line is in.</i>

27:39.291 --> 27:40.958
-<i> Both stern lines in, Captain.</i>

27:40.960 --> 27:42.793
-<i> Looks pretty good.</i>
<i> Good job.</i>

27:42.795 --> 27:49.867
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:52.671 --> 27:54.571
- Hello, good morning,
how'd you sleep?

27:54.573 --> 27:55.839
- Good.
- Good.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.241
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Kate.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.510
- The dog doesn't
get seasick, huh?

27:59.512 --> 28:01.779
- So far.
- Has it ever?

28:01.781 --> 28:02.880
- Like, even when
he was a puppy?

28:02.882 --> 28:04.048
No?

28:04.050 --> 28:06.383
- He doesn't like
smaller boats.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.019
- Too restrictive.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.058
- All right, people,
here we go.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.593
Eggs Florentine
with turkey bacon.

28:16.595 --> 28:17.861
- Okay.

28:20.365 --> 28:24.301
So we have eggs Benedict
Florentine with turkey bacon.

28:24.303 --> 28:27.204
- That looks beautiful.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.439
- Wow, this is really good.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.574
So good.
- It's delicious.

28:30.576 --> 28:31.975
- Very good.

28:31.977 --> 28:33.777
- Happy?

28:33.779 --> 28:36.547
- The only person not happy
is you.

28:36.549 --> 28:42.586
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

28:42.588 --> 28:44.755
- All right, Kelley, leads,
get this anchor dropped.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.591
- Roger that.
We're on our way up.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.560
-<i> I need four shots,</i>
<i> go ahead and drop.</i>

28:49.562 --> 28:51.228
-<i> Roger that, four shots,</i>
<i> dropping now.</i>

28:51.230 --> 28:57.735
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

28:57.737 --> 28:59.336
<i> - Okay, lock it in.</i>
<i> - Roger that.</i>

28:59.338 --> 29:01.405
- I do feel a little ostracized,
a little alienated

29:01.407 --> 29:03.741
<i> with the whole deck crew</i>
<i> and everything.</i>

29:03.743 --> 29:06.410
And I really think Kelley
is the f---ing whole problem.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.845
-<i> She looks</i>
<i> like she's holding good.</i>

29:07.847 --> 29:08.946
- Roger that.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.347
<i> Thank you, sir.</i>

29:11.616 --> 29:13.884
- Is it possible for us
to get Scupper off?

29:13.886 --> 29:15.185
-<i> Captain Lee, come in.</i>

29:15.187 --> 29:17.087
- What do you need?

29:17.089 --> 29:18.956
-<i> Guest was wondering if we</i>
<i> could take them to the beach</i>

29:18.958 --> 29:20.457
<i> 'cause Scupper needs</i>
<i> to use the restroom.</i>

29:20.459 --> 29:21.592
- Can you run them in?

29:21.594 --> 29:22.626
-<i> Copy that.</i>

29:22.628 --> 29:28.632
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:28.634 --> 29:31.535
- The guests are still
ashore, yeah?

29:31.537 --> 29:33.203
- Yes, master.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.405
- Yeah, we got to stop
this bullsh--, babe.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.242
Can we both, like,
reach some kind of agreement?

29:38.244 --> 29:41.445
- I don't know, but...
see you next Tuesday.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.247
- You're a Tuesday.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.048
<i> It's no fun arguing with Kate,</i>

29:45.050 --> 29:48.051
<i> because if I wind her up,</i>
<i> she won't show it.</i>

29:48.053 --> 29:51.155
And then she'll really
wind me up.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.057
And, you know, okay, maybe
she's better at it than me.

29:54.059 --> 29:56.326
But that's not something
I want to focus on in life,

29:56.328 --> 29:58.228
is pissing people off.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.597
- You're right, I'm a Tuesday
every day of the week.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.300
- And you never take
a f---ing day off.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.569
- Not a lot of grass.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.237
- But you found a spot.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.642
- All nice and new and shiny.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.811
It's almost a shame
to put it in the water.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.445
You're gonna need
another person.

30:15.447 --> 30:17.981
- Nico, Nico,
get back here to the swim deck.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.483
- Find a air port?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.151
- You've got one
on each end, I'm sure.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.419
- Oh, here's one, over here.

30:22.421 --> 30:23.787
One, two...

30:26.926 --> 30:28.792
No, no, no, no,
we don't want it on that side.

30:28.794 --> 30:30.494
- Oh, boy, 'cause this
isn't sinking.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.696
- That's not gonna be good,
sh--.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.631
- What a pain in the ass
this thing is.

30:34.633 --> 30:35.833
- Hey, Nico,
we're gonna bring you

30:35.835 --> 30:38.635
some shackles to put in there.

30:38.637 --> 30:39.770
- On the center one here,

30:39.772 --> 30:41.939
and on the center one
over there.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.208
Are there any corners
that are still up at all?

30:44.210 --> 30:46.877
Do you have any extra weight
in those back three?

30:46.879 --> 30:49.479
- Nico, let's go, man.
Good job.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.715
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

30:54.220 --> 30:55.986
- I thought it was supposed
to keep the critters out.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.290
- Don't worry, there's a net
under us in the pool.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.626
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.228
- How was it, guy?
- Very fun.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.596
- They used it
for about five minutes

31:05.598 --> 31:07.064
<i> and realized they look</i>
<i> like babies</i>

31:07.066 --> 31:08.232
<i> inside of a baby pen.</i>

31:08.234 --> 31:10.067
So glad I set that up for you.

31:13.905 --> 31:20.911
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:24.916 --> 31:27.017
- I have to iron
Scupper's tuxedo.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.518
- Wow.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.953
- Hey, Kate, do you think
this would be okay

31:29.955 --> 31:31.355
if I just steamed it?

31:31.357 --> 31:32.789
- Just on the lowest setting,
and go real quick.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.191
- Okay.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.659
- Don't burn the baby's
clothes, Sierra.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.761
Just don't burn
the baby's clothes.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.596
- Look at this.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.131
He's all set.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.634
- Hey, Ben,
can I seat the guests?

31:43.636 --> 31:45.068
- Yes, you may.

31:48.673 --> 31:49.940
- Shellfish risotto.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.541
- Ready?
- Yes, I am.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.010
- Yay.
- Are you good with three?

31:53.012 --> 31:54.945
- Yeah.
- Yeah, brilliant, cheers.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.214
- And we have seafood risotto.

31:57.216 --> 32:00.083
Lobster, mussels, and clams.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.118
- Wow.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.953
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

32:05.491 --> 32:06.924
-<i> Hey, Kel.</i>

32:06.926 --> 32:08.325
- Hey, what are you doing?

32:08.327 --> 32:10.827
-<i> Oh, just at the house,</i>
<i> hanging out.</i>

32:10.829 --> 32:12.062
<i> It's so good to talk to you!</i>

32:12.064 --> 32:13.130
- It's good to talk to you.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.264
I've missed you.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.399
-<i> Oh, my gosh, I miss you too.</i>

32:15.401 --> 32:16.767
- My sister's on another boat

32:16.769 --> 32:18.635
with a captain
that she's dating.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.605
And I kind of wish
she was here right now.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.508
- Did you poot?
- No.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.677
- Oh, my gosh, Kelley.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.979
That is so rank, seriously.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.013
<i> Okay, spill the beans.</i>

32:30.015 --> 32:31.448
<i> Who is everyone?</i>

32:31.450 --> 32:33.583
- Okay, so I have one deckhand

32:33.585 --> 32:35.485
who has been nothing
but a pain in my ass.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.954
-<i> Oh, gosh.</i>

32:36.956 --> 32:38.588
- My other two
are like golden children.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.590
<i> They're great.</i>
<i> He just gets so defensive.</i>

32:40.592 --> 32:42.592
<i> First thing he does is he</i>
<i>comes out, gets in the hot tub.</i>

32:42.594 --> 32:44.494
Nico comes in,
and Trevor's like,

32:44.496 --> 32:47.164
"Oh, cool tattoo, bro,
but the shading's sh--."

32:47.166 --> 32:48.665
-<i> So can I have it straight?</i>

32:48.667 --> 32:49.933
<i> There's three dudes</i>
<i> in a hot tub</i>

32:49.935 --> 32:51.535
<i> arguing about a tattoo?"</i>

32:54.373 --> 32:56.606
<i> Wait a second.</i>

32:56.608 --> 32:59.042
- Oh, I hate you so much
right now.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.377
<i> Talking to my sister</i>
<i> is really good.</i>

33:00.379 --> 33:01.979
And she'll usually give me

33:01.981 --> 33:04.514
<i> a good opposite version</i>
<i> of what I would do.</i>

33:07.051 --> 33:09.286
F---, I love my sister.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.954
She's the sh--.

33:10.956 --> 33:12.122
-<i> Tipping my hat to ya.</i>

33:12.124 --> 33:13.156
- All right.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.758
-<i> Okay, well, I miss you.</i>

33:14.760 --> 33:16.626
- Did you know that the Germans
had trained poodles

33:16.628 --> 33:20.664
in the 17th century
to dive for lobster?

33:20.666 --> 33:23.166
- Okay, Ben, we're ready
for dessert whenever you are.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.801
- Emily, you're
gonna be late girl.

33:24.803 --> 33:25.802
- Okay.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.071
- Dinner goes surprisingly well

33:28.073 --> 33:31.908
when Kate's not acting
like a mega bee-hatch.

33:31.910 --> 33:35.145
<i> I need more nights like this.</i>

33:35.147 --> 33:37.147
- Tiramisu.
- Oh, good.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.415
- Thank you.

33:40.351 --> 33:41.852
- I want to go in the hot tub.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.253
- We're just
gonna take Scupper out.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.254
You ready, buddy?

33:44.256 --> 33:51.328
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:12.751 --> 34:14.618
-<i> I just had a f---ing long day.</i>

34:14.620 --> 34:17.921
And what's one shot of liquor
gonna do to a guy like me

34:17.923 --> 34:19.222
who can drink
a f---ing full bottle?

34:19.224 --> 34:20.424
Nothing.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.225
Fair winds

34:22.227 --> 34:23.994
- You got it, bro.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.997
- This is a total no-no.

34:26.999 --> 34:30.167
<i> But it's not my nature to tell</i>
<i> on another crew member.</i>

34:30.169 --> 34:32.135
I don't know
if you should have done that.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.170
- I'm not worried about it.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.337
Doesn't matter.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.540
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:38.976 --> 34:40.444
- Did you just chug that?

34:40.446 --> 34:41.611
- What are you doing, man?

34:41.613 --> 34:42.979
- Just chill the f--- out.

34:42.981 --> 34:45.248
- Ben being a dick,
you being a bitch.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.350
- You know what?

34:47.352 --> 34:48.919
You're done with that.

34:49.921 --> 34:55.425
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:58.229 --> 35:00.630
- Ready to get some coffee, hon?
- Yeah.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.365
- All right, guys, let's pull it
up and get out of here.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.168
- Two shots, there you go.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.504
-<i> Let's get it in</i>

35:07.506 --> 35:08.905

35:09.975 --> 35:12.576

35:12.578 --> 35:14.978
- It must be good
if no one's talking.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.813
- I know.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.315
-<i> We're ready.</i>

35:18.317 --> 35:19.683

35:30.762 --> 35:32.362
- F--- yeah.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.864
- So when are we
coming back?

35:33.866 --> 35:34.998
Soon, I hope.

35:35.000 --> 35:35.999
- Next week.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.902
-<i> Attention all crew,</i>

35:38.904 --> 35:42.873
<i> I need everybody</i>
<i> on the aft deck in five.</i>

35:42.875 --> 35:44.341
- Have to say good-bye.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.342
Come on, we got to
say good-bye.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.776
- There we go.

35:46.778 --> 35:47.777
- Enjoy New York.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.579
- Thank you for everything.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.214
- See you later,
you come back.

35:51.216 --> 35:53.517
- It was, like,
the greatest trip.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.852
I didn't have to worry about
any boat problems whatsoever.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.220
Thank you all.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.389
Thank you so much,
really appreciate it.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.791
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.493
- Bye.
- Thank you.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.028
- Bye, Scupper.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.630
- Let's go to work.

36:06.632 --> 36:13.737
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

36:15.673 --> 36:19.476
- Just see how hard
old maid's working right now.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.977
He's loving life.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.245
- Where is he?
- Where do you think?

36:22.247 --> 36:23.547
- Having a ciggy?

36:23.549 --> 36:24.981
- I just see him sitting
on the tender,

36:24.983 --> 36:26.049
not doing jack sh--.

36:26.051 --> 36:27.484
- What the f---?

36:27.486 --> 36:29.186
- Attention all crew,

36:29.188 --> 36:31.188
<i> I need everybody</i>
<i> in the crew mess immediately.</i>

36:31.190 --> 36:33.557
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

36:33.559 --> 36:37.594
So I think this charter
was--thought it was okay.

36:37.596 --> 36:41.164
You know, like kissing
your sister.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.900
I think one of the things
we need to work on, though,

36:43.902 --> 36:46.336
is a communication breakdown,

36:46.338 --> 36:48.405
specifically about
the clambake.

36:48.407 --> 36:51.041
-<i> I did the best job</i>
<i> to the best of my abilities,</i>

36:51.043 --> 36:52.909
and I don't know
why I get dogged

36:52.911 --> 36:54.911
for every frickin' tip meeting.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.781
This communication thing,
yeah, it's diabolical.

36:57.783 --> 37:01.384
- So we do have some money
to divvy up here.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.853
It wasn't as much
as the last one.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.156
A little under 12 grand.

37:06.158 --> 37:09.392
$1,085 apiece.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.161
-<i> We do need to work</i>
<i> on our communication.</i>

37:11.163 --> 37:13.163
But I don't think
Captain Lee knows

37:13.165 --> 37:15.165
the extent of Ben's freak-out,

37:15.167 --> 37:18.301
and if he had, he would have
called him out a bit more.

37:18.303 --> 37:20.070
- You can go out tonight.

37:20.072 --> 37:22.072
But remember
that it's a work day.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.406
We need to crank it today.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.041
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, Captain.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.344
- Thank you.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.312
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

37:29.314 --> 37:30.714
- So what do you want to do?

37:30.716 --> 37:32.249
What's the game plan
for tonight?

37:32.251 --> 37:34.651
Get a little food,
get a little drinks?

37:34.653 --> 37:36.753
- Make a little love,
get down tonight?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.021
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

37:38.023 --> 37:39.556
- Is this our
anniversary today?

37:39.558 --> 37:41.591
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.660
- Yeah, made it
to our first week.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.761
- Oh, my God.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.363
-<i> It's so hard to believe</i>

37:46.365 --> 37:48.198
that I've only known Nico
for two charters,

37:48.200 --> 37:49.899
'cause I feel like we've known
each other forever.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.835
<i> It's just really easy</i>
<i> on so many levels.</i>

37:51.837 --> 37:55.572
And he's--
I mean, yeah, he's cute.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.773
- Ooh!

37:58.210 --> 38:04.614
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

38:04.616 --> 38:07.617
- Did the girls go out
for tanning?

38:07.619 --> 38:09.152
- They're, like,
meditating and sh--.

38:09.154 --> 38:12.022
- So relaxing.

38:12.024 --> 38:13.023
- Huh.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.627

38:19.798 --> 38:21.364
- Emily's cute.

38:21.366 --> 38:23.366
<i> She's got an amazing accent.</i>

38:23.368 --> 38:25.568
And it's been five months,
people.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.004
- What is she doing?
- They're trying to de-stress.

- When's Ro coming?

38:36.214 --> 38:37.847
- Soon.

38:37.849 --> 38:40.583
- I'm probably a better
soccer player, than him.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.419
- He's probably
a better chef than you.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.755
- These are cutie cute.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.324
- Thanks.
Yeah, they're comfy too.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.359
- Yeah, nice.

38:49.361 --> 38:50.593
- Gimme some positive vibes.

Can I get a painkiller?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.473

39:03.475 --> 39:04.708
And then what do you guys want?

39:05.811 --> 39:07.977
- Vodka, dirty, please.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.946
- Can she get it filthy, please?

39:09.948 --> 39:12.515
Make it hard.

39:12.517 --> 39:15.819
- I want to say it is so much
fun working with all of you.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.854
And, yeah, let's get weird.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.823
- I hear that.
- As if we're not weird enough.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.392
- Let's get weirder.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.294
- I never thought of it
that way.

39:24.296 --> 39:27.163
- That's why I don't drink
out of martini glasses.

39:27.165 --> 39:28.531
- Did you just chug that?

39:28.533 --> 39:30.834
- No, Trevor did.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.535
- Your hair,
it's gorgeous, though.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.137
You do a very good job
every time.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.705
- Thank you.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.007
- I could style your hair
f---ing phenomenally.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.209
- Wow.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.910
- Trevor giving you hair advice?

39:40.912 --> 39:43.980
- I modeled for Paul Mitchell
for two years almost.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.515
I could show you guys
some of my modeling pictures.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.250
You go into a Paul Mitchell
catalog still to this day,

39:47.252 --> 39:49.052
you'll see me in the long hair.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.220
- All right,
let's get out of here.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.555
- She's ready.
- Yes.

39:52.557 --> 39:55.759
- Can I get a Bud Light,
a Stoli soda,

39:55.761 --> 39:58.161
and two filthy martinis?

39:58.163 --> 39:59.763

39:59.765 --> 40:02.031
<i> Where do you think</i>
<i> this is gonna go?</i>

40:02.033 --> 40:03.700
- There's swings over there.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.735
- Yeah, I think we should
switch over to those, huh?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.404
- Yeah, look, come.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.372

- Yeah.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.416

I don't know how to do

40:20.952 --> 40:22.852
anything but talking about it.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.921

asking for you over there.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.458
Whoa.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.897
- So, tell me...

40:45.342 --> 40:46.843
- Kelley's quite cute

40:46.845 --> 40:48.478
<i> but I'm very picky.</i>

40:48.480 --> 40:51.147

someone quite deeply

40:51.149 --> 40:52.749
before anything happens.

40:52.751 --> 40:55.351
- Don't touch our swing.

41:07.199 --> 41:08.765
- I think so.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.167
- Because I'm telling you
something different?

41:11.169 --> 41:12.802
- You're not
telling me anything.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.039
- Ben being a dick,
you being a bitch?

41:16.041 --> 41:17.707

41:17.709 --> 41:19.876
Choose your words,
be creative.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.644
- That makes me annoyed,
when you call her a bitch.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.546
It does.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.949
I'm the only person that's
allowed to call her a bitch.

41:25.951 --> 41:26.950
I'm sorry.
- Yeah, it's true.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.117
- Hey, hey.

and stop annoying me.

You're done with that.
