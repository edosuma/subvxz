WEBVTT

00:02.468 --> 00:04.837
TONIGHT, GORDON HEADS
TO THE HAMPTONS

00:04.871 --> 00:06.906
FOR SOME TRADITIONAL
IRISH FARE.

00:06.939 --> 00:08.808
SPRING ROLLS WITH MUSTARD.

00:08.841 --> 00:11.044
BUT FINDS A FAMILY PUB
THAT'S LOST ITS WAY.

00:11.077 --> 00:12.278
GET OUTTA HERE.

00:12.311 --> 00:13.880
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
A PUB AT ALL.

00:13.913 --> 00:14.847
THE FATHER'S STRUGGLING

00:14.881 --> 00:15.748
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.

00:15.782 --> 00:16.983
WE'RE IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.885
GET OUTTA HERE.
GET OUTTA HERE.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.720
BUT THE SONS
ARE PULLING IT APART.

00:20.753 --> 00:22.655
YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO ANYTHING I WANT TO SAY.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.257
YOU ALMOST WANT TO TELL HIM
TO SHUT UP.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.159
ONE HIDES BEHIND THE BAR.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.627
I DO MY JOB.
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AT THE BAR.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.195
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

00:29.228 --> 00:30.000
THE OTHER
IS DRUNK WITH POWER.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.130
THE OTHER
IS DRUNK WITH POWER.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.199
ENOUGH.
GET OUTTA HERE.

00:33.232 --> 00:35.668
AND THE FOOD THEY SERVE...

00:35.702 --> 00:37.136
THIS IS LETHAL.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.805
HAS SENT
THE LOCALS PACKING.

00:38.838 --> 00:39.872
WE HAVE TO WORK

00:39.906 --> 00:41.674
AND REALLY DIG DEEP

00:41.708 --> 00:43.609
TO GET THESE LOCALS
BACK ON OUR SIDE.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.344
CHEF RAMSAY'S NOT
THE BEST COOK IN THE WORLD.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.046
HE THINKS HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
WHETHER HE DOES OR NOT.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.548
IF BRIAN WASN'T MY SON,
I'D HAVE FIRED HIM.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.049
YOU GOT AN ISSUE?

00:50.083 --> 00:51.884
I'M OUTTA HERE.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.087
WITH ONLY ONE WEEK
TO TURN IT AROUND...

00:54.120 --> 00:55.922
YOU CAN MOVE FASTER HERE,
LET'S GO.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.156
WILL GORDON BE ABLE TO FIND

00:57.190 --> 00:58.624
THIS FAMILY'S POT OF GOLD?

00:58.658 --> 01:00.000
EVERY DAY YOU HAVE TO
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.359
EVERY DAY YOU HAVE TO
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

01:00.393 --> 01:04.063
OR HAS THE LUCK OF THE IRISH
RUN OUT?

01:04.097 --> 01:05.298
I DON'T SEE HOW
THIS IS GONNA WORK.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.699
WE'RE SCREWED.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.935
THAT'S COMING UP
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.000
THE HAMPTONS
IS A BEAUTIFUL GETAWAY

01:30.000 --> 01:31.591
THE HAMPTONS
IS A BEAUTIFUL GETAWAY

01:31.624 --> 01:35.628
FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS
IN THE SUMMER.

01:35.661 --> 01:37.797
BUT IN THE WINTER,
IT'S A QUAINT VILLAGE

01:37.830 --> 01:40.066
INHABITED BY
A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.

01:40.099 --> 01:43.169
AMONG THE MANY EATERIES HERE
IS FINN McCOOL'S,

01:43.202 --> 01:44.470
A FAMILY RESTAURANT

01:44.504 --> 01:48.641
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY DYING.

01:48.674 --> 01:51.878
GORDON RAMSAY IS HERE
TO BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO IT.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.613
I KNOW IT'S WINTER
BUT GOD,

01:53.646 --> 01:55.948
YOU'D THINK THERE'D
BE SOMEBODY AROUND HERE.

01:55.982 --> 01:59.619
THIS PLACE IS DESOLATE.
THERE'S HARDLY ANYBODY AROUND.

01:59.652 --> 02:00.000
AWW, COME ON.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.187
AWW, COME ON.

02:01.220 --> 02:04.290
YOU GOT A LOT
OF PREPPING TO DO.

02:04.323 --> 02:06.159
THERE HE GOES.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.794
I'M THE OWNER OF FINN McCOOL'S
FAMILY RESTAURANT

02:07.827 --> 02:09.095
AND IRISH PUB.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.932
* MY YOUNG LOVE
SAID TO ME *

02:12.965 --> 02:14.600
I WAS A POLICE OFFICER.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.369
I WORKED FOR THE SOUTHAMPTON
TOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.171
I WAS THERE OVER 20 YEARS.

02:18.204 --> 02:19.539
ARE WE READY?

02:19.572 --> 02:20.940
THESE SHOULD BE MOVED
OVER HERE A LITTLE BIT.

02:20.973 --> 02:22.141
AND I RETIRED.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.443
AND I WAS RETIRED
FOR 12 HOURS,

02:24.477 --> 02:26.078
EIGHT OF WHICH I SLEPT,

02:26.112 --> 02:27.413
AND THEN WE OPENED UP.

02:27.446 --> 02:29.649
FINN McCOOL'S
FAMILY RESTAURANT

02:29.682 --> 02:30.000
WE ARE A FAMILY, I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.684
WE ARE A FAMILY, I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT.

02:31.717 --> 02:33.719
SO THAT'S WHO
WE WANTED TO CATER TO.

02:33.753 --> 02:35.822
BOTH OF MY SONS
WORK HERE FULL TIME.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.191
AND JASON,
HE'S THE BAR MANAGER.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.159
WHAT'S UP?
CAN I GET
THOSE SHOTS?

02:40.193 --> 02:41.828
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AT THE BAR.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.362
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.264
MY PROBLEMS
ARE MORE WITH MY BROTHER.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.033
I'M GONNA KICK YOU
RIGHT IN THE TEETH, I SWEAR--

02:47.066 --> 02:48.167
LET ME HELP YOU OUT.
GET OUTTA HERE.

02:48.201 --> 02:49.702
WHAT DO YOU
NEED ME TO DO?

02:49.735 --> 02:51.070
I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND
WORKING WITH FAMILY.

02:51.103 --> 02:52.104
IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.

02:52.138 --> 02:53.139
YOU'RE AN ASS.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.874
I SWEAR TO  YOU ARE.

02:54.907 --> 02:56.509
I'M VERY GOOD
AT WHAT I DO.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.077
I DON'T KNOW
IF MY DAD AND MY BROTHER

02:58.110 --> 03:00.000
COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT ME
BEING IN THE KITCHEN.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.179
COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT ME
BEING IN THE KITCHEN.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.214
GO AWAY.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.548
AH, YOU GO AWAY.

03:02.582 --> 03:05.117
HE IS AN ARROGANT
LITTLE BASTARD.

03:06.519 --> 03:10.556
I DEVELOPED THE NAME
"CHEF SHORTCUT" FOR HIM

03:10.590 --> 03:12.191
BECAUSE HE JUST CUTS CORNERS.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.626
HE'LL DEEP-FRY BACON.

03:13.659 --> 03:15.328
AND THEY COME OUT
LIKE PIG'S TAILS.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.562
IT'S LIKE CHEWING
A BACON BALL.

03:16.596 --> 03:17.296
IT'S ABSURD.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.598
I'M IN CHARGE OF THE FOOD

03:18.631 --> 03:20.266
AND I HAVE MY NAME BEHIND IT.

03:20.299 --> 03:22.168
AND I KNOW WHAT CAN WORK
AND WHAT WILL WORK.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.636
HE CAN BE PRETTY COCKY
AT TIMES.

03:23.669 --> 03:25.304
YOU'RE SO
FULL OF CRAP.

03:25.338 --> 03:26.873
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN HE'S
VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.140
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK AT ME.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.342
NO.
I SWEAR ON LILY.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.000
TO THE POINT WHERE I--

03:30.000 --> 03:30.776
TO THE POINT WHERE I--

03:30.810 --> 03:32.545
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE THINGS THAT HE SAYS.

03:32.578 --> 03:33.813
WHAT DO YOU
NEED IT FOR?

03:33.846 --> 03:35.014
SO I CAN
THROW IT AT YOU.

03:35.047 --> 03:37.316
BRIAN AND JASON
BUTT HEADS A LOT.

03:37.350 --> 03:40.019
IT COMES PRETTY CLOSE
TO BLOWS.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.489
WELL, TELL HIM TO STAY
THE  OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

03:43.522 --> 03:45.091
JASON, YOU KNOW,
TRIES TO TALK TO HIM.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.059
BRIAN'S ALL--
HIS EARS CLOSE DOWN.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.227
"NO, NO, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT."

03:48.261 --> 03:50.429
WHATEVER.
GROW UP.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.198
THIS ISN'T NURSERY SCHOOL.

03:52.231 --> 03:53.466
I DON'T REALLY GIVE A
ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS.

03:53.499 --> 03:54.634
IT WOULD BE GREAT

03:54.667 --> 03:56.202
TO HAVE SOMEBODY
OF CHEF RAMSAY'S CALIBER

03:56.235 --> 03:57.603
COME IN AND SHOW BRIAN
THAT HE'S NOT RIGHT.

03:59.038 --> 04:00.000
I DON'T NEED HELP COOKING.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.874
I DON'T NEED HELP COOKING.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.576
BEFORE, I WOULD JUST
LEAVE THE KITCHEN

04:03.609 --> 04:05.144
AND LET HIM GO
ON HIS WAY,

04:05.177 --> 04:08.481
BUT THE BUSINESS,
IT'S FLOUNDERING.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.016
THERE'S NO WAY
OF ANYBODY KNOWING

04:10.049 --> 04:11.517
THAT IT WAS A RESTAURANT.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.119
YOU KNOW, WE PUT SIGNS
ON THE WINDOWS

04:13.152 --> 04:15.221
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE,

04:15.254 --> 04:16.956
BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A SIGN OUT FRONT.

04:16.989 --> 04:19.058
WE JUST DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.661
BUDDY IS IN DEBT SOMEWHERE IN
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.729
MY FATHER'S INVESTED

04:23.763 --> 04:25.831
EVERYTHING HE HAS
INTO THIS BUSINESS.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.634
HIS WHOLE LIFE AS A COP
AND RETIREMENT

04:28.668 --> 04:29.969
AND PENSION
AND THIS AND THAT,

04:30.002 --> 04:31.270
IT'S GONE.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.205
I ABSOLUTELY WORRY
ABOUT BUDDY'S HEALTH.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.110
I WORRY A LOT
ABOUT HIS HEALTH.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.079
IT'S NOT MY BOAT AND I
DON'T WANNA GO DOWN WITH IT.

04:40.112 --> 04:41.614
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE THINKS

04:41.647 --> 04:43.149
HE CAN BE
THE WAY HE IS.

04:43.182 --> 04:44.483
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,

04:44.517 --> 04:47.586
IT SCARES ME TO THINK
HOW MUCH

04:47.620 --> 04:49.488
NOT ONLY DOES HE LOSE,
HOW MUCH EVERYBODY LOSES,

04:49.522 --> 04:52.024
'CAUSE WE NEED THIS
FOR OUR FAMILY.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.126
I'M WORRYING
EVERY NIGHT GOING TO BED,

04:54.160 --> 04:56.629
"ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO PAY THIS MORTGAGE?"

04:56.662 --> 04:59.865
AND TRY TO JUST BARELY
SCRAPE BY AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

04:59.899 --> 05:00.000
I CAN'T DESCRIBE TO YOU
HOW STRESSFUL THAT IS.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.337
I CAN'T DESCRIBE TO YOU
HOW STRESSFUL THAT IS.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.006
I CAN'T.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.685
HERE I'M AT FINN McCOOL'S

05:19.719 --> 05:21.087
TO HELP A FAMILY
THAT ARE IN CRISIS,

05:21.120 --> 05:22.621
AND BLOODY HELL,

05:22.655 --> 05:24.924
IT LOOKS LIKE A FUNERAL PARLOR
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.292
NOT A RESTAURANT.

05:26.325 --> 05:27.593
GOD.

05:27.626 --> 05:30.000
IT'S SO GRIM.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.464
IT'S SO GRIM.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.132
HELLO.

05:33.165 --> 05:34.533
HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

05:34.567 --> 05:36.402
BUDDY MAZIO.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:36.435 --> 05:38.437
MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS
OF CHEF RAMSAY

05:38.471 --> 05:40.873
WERE THAT HE'S
AN INTENSE MAN.

05:40.906 --> 05:42.808
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF HE WAS GONNA BE

05:42.842 --> 05:44.777
SOME KIND OF A BASTARD
OR AN EGO MAN

05:44.810 --> 05:45.978
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.413
THIS IS MY SON JASON.

05:47.446 --> 05:48.781
JASON, NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:48.814 --> 05:50.049
NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOOD.
HELLO.

05:50.082 --> 05:51.083
THIS IS CAROL.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.385
CAROL, NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.619
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF GORDON,

05:53.652 --> 05:55.054
I THINK HE'S ADORABLE.

05:55.087 --> 05:57.923
I WOULD LOVE
TO GET MY HANDS ON GORDON.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.625
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
MELISSA.

05:59.658 --> 06:00.000
MELISSA, HELLO.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.093
MELISSA, HELLO.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.661
MY SON BRIAN.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.563
CHEF, HOW ARE YOU?
ARE YOU WELL?

06:04.597 --> 06:06.632
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
WHEN HE CAME IN,

06:06.665 --> 06:08.801
I WAS DEFINITELY
A LITTLE SKEPTICAL.

06:08.834 --> 06:11.070
I DO MY OWN THING BACK HERE,
I'M VERY CONTENT WITH THAT.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.139
SO LET'S START WITH CAROL.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.207
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

06:15.241 --> 06:18.310
WE HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH STAFF.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.079
UH-HUH.
WE HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH BRIAN.

06:20.112 --> 06:22.114
UH, OKAY.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.817
HE'S, UH,
A BIT ARROGANT AND--

06:24.850 --> 06:26.352
A LOT ARROGANT.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.721
BECAUSE I SAY
WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID

06:28.754 --> 06:30.000
AND YOU PEOPLE DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, TOO BAD.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.489
AND YOU PEOPLE DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, TOO BAD.

06:32.124 --> 06:34.260
WE'RE HERE
TO MAKEMONEY.
YEAH.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.162
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO YOUR JOB, GET OUT.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.963
I'M SORRY, BRIAN,
BUT IT DOES STEM--

06:37.997 --> 06:39.365
IT STEMS FROM HIM,

06:39.398 --> 06:42.535
BECAUSE HE WON'T LISTEN
TO BUDDY.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.636
AN EXAMPLE LIKE?

06:43.669 --> 06:45.071
VALENTINE'S DAY.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.206
I WANTED HIM TO DO
A NICE VALENTINE'S DAY MENU.

06:47.239 --> 06:48.808
HE DIDN'T SEE THE NEED FOR IT
'CAUSE WE'RE AN IRISH PUB.

06:48.841 --> 06:49.775
HE DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY
WOULD COME IN

06:49.809 --> 06:52.578
FOR AN IRISH PUB
FOR VALENTINES DAY.

06:52.611 --> 06:54.647
IT'S THE NIGHT BEFORE
VALENTINES DAY AND YOU SAY,

06:54.680 --> 06:55.347
"WE WANT TO DO
A VALENTINES MENU TOMORROW."

06:58.684 --> 07:00.000
TALKING ABOUT
TWO WEEKS BEFORE.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.419
TALKING ABOUT
TWO WEEKS BEFORE.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.088
TALKING ABOUT
A WEEK BEFORE.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.123
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME TO ORDER.

07:04.156 --> 07:05.991
BUT IT'S
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

07:06.025 --> 07:07.159
TO HAVE COME UP WITH IT
WEEKS BEFORE

07:07.193 --> 07:08.627
'CAUSE YOU ARE
THE HEAD CHEF.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.496
WE DON'T ADVERTISE.

07:10.529 --> 07:11.464
SCREW 'EM.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.665
OH, BOY.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.366
RIGHT NOW,
I'M HUNGRY.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.868
I WANT TO TASTE THE FOOD.

07:15.901 --> 07:17.570
AND LET'S MEET AFTER,
SHALL WE?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.071
I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.107
I WONDER WHAT
HE'S GONNA SEE.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.608
I WONDER IF WE'RE GONNA GET
REALLY BLASTED.

07:22.641 --> 07:23.909
YOU KNOW?

07:23.943 --> 07:25.845
THERE'S OUR
LUNCH MENU.
THANK YOU.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.379
I'M LIKE, "I'M ABOUT
TO SERVE CHEF RAMSAY.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.281
LIKE, THIS IS SO COOL."

07:29.315 --> 07:30.000
THE CLAMS,
ARE THEY FRESH CLAMS?

07:30.000 --> 07:30.950
THE CLAMS,
ARE THEY FRESH CLAMS?

07:30.983 --> 07:34.053
UM, HONESTLY, IT'S FROZEN.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.589
HMM.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.658
I'LL START
WITH THE, UH,

07:39.692 --> 07:41.927
FINN'S SPRING ROLL, PLEASE.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.629
GOOD CHOICE.
THANK YOU.

07:43.662 --> 07:45.531
CAN I GO FOR THE SALMON
AS WELL, PLEASE?

07:45.564 --> 07:47.099
AND FOR THE MAIN COURSE, I'LL
HAVE A SHEPHERD'S PIE,

07:47.133 --> 07:48.100
PLEASE, I THINK.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.168
OKAY.
THANK YOU, MELISSA.

07:49.201 --> 07:50.236
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.585
I'M A VERY CONFIDENT PERSON.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.521
AND I'VE BEEN IN THE KITCHEN
FOR A LONG TIME.

08:08.554 --> 08:12.057
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
WE'LL GET A GOOD REVIEW.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.793
WHEN YOU GET
A FAMILY BUSINESS RIGHT,

08:14.827 --> 08:16.695
IT GOES ON FOR GENERATIONS.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.631
AND HERE,

08:18.664 --> 08:21.800
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
A FAMILY-RUN BUSINESS AT ALL.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.403
PUBS ARE FULL OF ATMOSPHERE,
FUN.

08:24.436 --> 08:26.005
IT'S GOT TWEED KNIT CURTAINS,

08:26.038 --> 08:27.273
LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO VISIT
YOUR GRANNY.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.642
WEIRD.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.000
HERE YOU ARE,
SOME SPRING ROLLS

08:30.000 --> 08:31.177
HERE YOU ARE,
SOME SPRING ROLLS

08:31.210 --> 08:32.811
WITH COLMAN'S
MUSTARD.

08:32.845 --> 08:33.812
WOW.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.648
GOD.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.787
IT'S A VERY STRANGE,
BIZARRE LOOKING SPRING ROLL.

08:44.623 --> 08:46.559
DAMN.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.127
ARE THEY POPULAR
ON THE MENU?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.496
UM, PEOPLE
REALLY LIKE THEM.

08:50.529 --> 08:53.098
NO DOUBT HALF THE CUSTOMERS
ARE DRUNK.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.405
NOT A BIG HIT.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.000
HE DIDN'T LIKE IT?
NO.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.106
HE DIDN'T LIKE IT?
NO.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.942
BRIAN'S IN THE KITCHEN,
LIKE, WONDERING.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.510
I'M JUST LIKE, "NOPE."

09:06.412 --> 09:08.247
HE REALLY THOUGHT THAT
I WAS GONNA WALK BACK THERE

09:08.280 --> 09:09.915
AND BE LIKE,
"HE LOVED IT."

09:09.949 --> 09:11.650
YOU KNOW, "HE WANTS YOU
TO COME WORK FOR HIM."

09:11.684 --> 09:14.186
COME ON.

09:15.854 --> 09:18.357
LET ME GET YOU
SOME CLEAN SILVERWARE.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.792
THANK YOU.
GOD.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.594
AND WHAT'S THIS STUFF HERE,
PLEASE, MELISSA?

09:21.627 --> 09:23.429
ON TOP
IS A BALSAMIC REDUCTION.

09:23.462 --> 09:24.763
HE LIKES TO USE THAT
A LOT.

09:24.797 --> 09:25.598
HE LIKES THAT,
DOESN'T HE?

09:25.631 --> 09:26.899
YES, HE DOES.

09:26.932 --> 09:28.834
ON EVERYTHING,
HE PUTS A LITTLE DRIZZLE ON.

09:28.867 --> 09:30.000
A LITTLE?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.070
A LITTLE?

09:31.103 --> 09:32.938
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.040
ALWAYS THE SIGN
OF A VERY INSECURE CHEF

09:35.074 --> 09:37.710
WHEN HE MACERATES EVERYTHING
IN BALSAMIC VINEGAR.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.546
LOOK AT THIS.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.982
HORRIBLE.

09:43.015 --> 09:45.184
DOESN'T TASTE LIKE SALMON
AT ALL.

09:45.217 --> 09:46.619
ALL THROUGH?

09:46.652 --> 09:48.554
DOES MY SHEPHERD'S PIE
HAVE ANY BALSAMIC VINEGAR?

09:48.587 --> 09:50.422
NO.
GOOD. LOVELY.

09:50.456 --> 09:53.492
I DON'T EVEN THINK
HE LIKES THE WATER.

09:53.525 --> 09:55.227
HE SAID, UM,
"WILL MY SHEPHERD'S PIE

09:55.261 --> 09:56.895
HAVE ANY
BALSAMIC VINEGAR ON IT?"

09:56.929 --> 09:58.831
I SAID, "I CAN ASSURE YOU
IT WILL NOT."

10:02.167 --> 10:03.369
AND I DON'T LIKE TO COME OFF

10:03.402 --> 10:04.637
CONCEITED OR COCKY.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.305
I'M VERY GOOD
AT WHAT I DO.

10:06.338 --> 10:07.773
I KNOW THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
VERY WELL

10:07.806 --> 10:10.309
AND I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT'S OUT THERE.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.251
ENJOY.
THANK YOU.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.920
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.989
IT'S JUST A BIG BALL
OF GREASE.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.367
IT'S JUST VERY,
VERY GREASY.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.807
DAMN.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.646
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

10:49.748 --> 10:51.116
SECOND DOOR ON THE LEFT.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.055
OH, NO.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.256
WE'RE JUST LIKE,

10:57.289 --> 10:58.857
"OH, MY GOD,
SOMETHING MADE--

10:58.891 --> 11:00.000
IT MADE HIM SICK."

11:00.000 --> 11:00.125
IT MADE HIM SICK."

11:07.599 --> 11:08.600
OH, MY GOD.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.338
COMING UP,

11:12.371 --> 11:13.772
GORDON DIGS UP THE DIRT
ON BRIAN.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.407
A DISASTER.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.776
AND LETS HIM KNOW WHAT
HE THINKS OF HIS FOOD.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.878
YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY
TAKE A GRIP OF YOUR BUSINESS.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.081
BUT BRIAN DOESN'T WANT
TO HEAR IT.

11:22.114 --> 11:23.849
I ALMOST WANT TO TELL HIM
TO SHUT UP.

11:23.882 --> 11:25.384
GET OUTTA HERE.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.686
WOULD YOU CARE TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS TICKET THEN?

11:27.720 --> 11:30.000
AND BUDDY WANTS TO
TAKE DOWN HIS SON.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.723
AND BUDDY WANTS TO
TAKE DOWN HIS SON.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.191
YOU GOT AN ISSUE?

11:32.224 --> 11:34.159
IF BRIAN WASN'T MY SON,
I'D HAVE FIRED HIM.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.829
AND IF THING'S
WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH...

11:36.862 --> 11:38.697
I WORRY ABOUT
BUDDY'S HEALTH.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.803
THAT'S COMING UP
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

11:52.176 --> 11:54.512
AFTER SUFFERING THROUGH

11:54.545 --> 11:57.548
THE BEST FINN McCOOL'S
HAS TO OFFER,

11:57.581 --> 12:00.885
IT'S TIME FOR GORDON TO HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT WITH THE CHEF.

12:00.918 --> 12:02.386
CLEARLY, WE'VE GOT ISSUES.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.888
WHEN A CHEF CAN'T MAKE

12:03.921 --> 12:05.723
A ING SHEPHERD'S PIE,
IT WORRIES ME.

12:05.756 --> 12:07.625
MY SHEPHERD PIE
WAS TAUGHT TO ME

12:07.658 --> 12:09.560
BY, YOU KNOW,
SOMEBODY WHO LEARNED IT

12:09.593 --> 12:12.096
FROM SOMEBODY WHO WENT
TO IRELAND.

12:12.129 --> 12:13.631
YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN AMERICAN IRISH PIE.

12:13.664 --> 12:16.539
TASTED LIKE COUGH MIXTURE.

12:16.539 --> 12:17.168
TASTED LIKE COUGH MIXTURE.

12:17.201 --> 12:19.303
AND THEN THE SALMON, WHAT ON
EARTH WAS GOING ON THERE?

12:19.336 --> 12:21.338
THE SALMON DISH
THAT I PUT OUT TO HIM

12:21.372 --> 12:23.974
ALWAYS HAD RAVE REVIEWS
FROM EVERYBODY THAT'S HAD IT.

12:24.008 --> 12:25.843
IT COULD BE TUNA FROM A CAN.

12:25.876 --> 12:29.680
IT WAS THAT OVERCOOKED.

12:29.714 --> 12:31.549
WAS THAT YOU AT YOUR BEST?

12:31.582 --> 12:32.950
IT WAS ME DOING WHAT I DO.

12:32.983 --> 12:34.185
I COOKED FOR YOU,
I IMAGINE,

12:34.218 --> 12:35.519
THE WAY
THAT I WOULD HAVE COOKED

12:35.553 --> 12:36.487
FOR SOMEBODY THAT WOULD
COME IN TOMORROW NIGHT

12:36.520 --> 12:37.855
THAT I DON'T KNOW.

12:37.888 --> 12:39.824
EVERY DAY YOU HAVE TO
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

12:39.857 --> 12:42.059
HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

12:42.093 --> 12:43.594
SO WHATEVER HE HAS TO TELL ME,

12:43.627 --> 12:46.063
DON'T REALLY CARE.

12:53.671 --> 12:56.340
FOR A RESTAURANT TO SURVIVE
IN THE HAMPTONS,

12:56.373 --> 12:58.175
IT NOT ONLY NEEDS
THE VACATION BUSINESS

12:58.209 --> 12:59.543
IN THE SUMMER,

12:59.577 --> 13:02.580
BUT A LOYAL LOCAL FOLLOWING
ALL YEAR ROUND.

13:02.613 --> 13:03.848
ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER.

13:03.881 --> 13:05.382
I'M AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.051
WHAT BETTER PLACE
TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT

13:07.084 --> 13:09.487
WHAT IS FINN McCOOL'S
REALLY ABOUT?

13:09.520 --> 13:11.856
'MORNING, GUYS.

13:11.889 --> 13:13.023
HOW ARE YOU?

13:13.057 --> 13:14.291
SIR, HOW ARE YOU?

13:14.325 --> 13:15.726
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ARE YOU WELL?

13:15.760 --> 13:16.539
I'M RICK SHOLTS.
RICK, NICE TO SEE YOU.

13:16.539 --> 13:17.061
I'M RICK SHOLTS.
RICK, NICE TO SEE YOU.

13:17.094 --> 13:18.829
WELCOME TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:18.863 --> 13:20.264
YEAH, I'M VERY HAPPY
TO BE HERE.

13:20.297 --> 13:24.602
WHAT ABOUT
FINN McCOOL'S?

13:24.635 --> 13:26.303
UH, A LOT OF FRIED FOOD.

13:26.337 --> 13:27.805
REALLY?
FRIED FOOD?

13:27.838 --> 13:30.541
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH
ON THE FRIED FOOD.

13:30.574 --> 13:32.042
WHAT I'D LIKE
YOU TO DO, UM,

13:32.076 --> 13:34.879
IF YOU COULD COME BACK

13:34.912 --> 13:37.081
AND COME AND HAVE DINNER THERE
AS MY GUESTS.

13:37.114 --> 13:40.184
UM...

13:40.217 --> 13:41.852
THESE GUYS HERE HAVE GOT
THEIR FINGERS ON THE PULSE

13:41.886 --> 13:43.687
IN THE COMMUNITY.

13:43.721 --> 13:45.689
AND YOU'VE GOT
TO LOOK AFTER LOCALS.

13:45.723 --> 13:46.539
WHAT BETTER LOCALS TO KEEP
ON YOUR SIDE THAN FIREMEN?

13:46.539 --> 13:47.191
WHAT BETTER LOCALS TO KEEP
ON YOUR SIDE THAN FIREMEN?

13:47.224 --> 13:48.425
PISS THEM OFF,

13:48.459 --> 13:50.995
YOU'VE PISSED
THE WHOLE TOWN OFF.

13:54.865 --> 13:57.234
AFTER INVITING THE FIREMEN
TO DINNER,

13:57.268 --> 13:58.702
GORDON DECIDES TO DO

13:58.736 --> 14:00.571
A QUICK INVESTIGATION
OF THE KITCHEN.

14:00.604 --> 14:03.274
THIS SHELF,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

14:03.307 --> 14:07.878
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY
WIPED IT DOWN?

14:07.912 --> 14:10.014
WOULD YOU
EAT THAT?

14:12.483 --> 14:13.617
THIS IS LETHAL.

14:13.651 --> 14:16.539
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT,
WHAT IS THAT?

14:16.539 --> 14:17.755
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT,
WHAT IS THAT?

14:25.129 --> 14:29.667
PLEASE TELL ME
PEOPLE DO NO EAT THAT.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.469
DEAR, DEAR,
COOKED CHICKEN WINGS.

14:32.503 --> 14:35.472
RAW FOOD AGAINST COOKED FOOD.

14:35.506 --> 14:37.341
WHAT ON EARTH?

14:37.374 --> 14:39.276
WHAT IS THAT?

14:39.310 --> 14:40.311
UGH.

14:40.344 --> 14:43.113
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

14:43.147 --> 14:44.281
KITCHEN NIGHTMARE?

14:44.315 --> 14:46.539
THIS IS A KITCHEN DISASTER.

14:46.539 --> 14:47.151
THIS IS A KITCHEN DISASTER.

14:48.586 --> 14:51.555
THERE IS ONE CLEAN THING
IN HERE.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.194
DISAPPOINTED BY THE STATE
OF THE KITCHEN,

14:57.228 --> 14:59.330
GORDON IS QUESTIONING
THE FAMILY'S COMMITMENT

14:59.363 --> 15:00.531
TO THEIR RESTAURANT.

15:00.564 --> 15:01.832
OKAY.

15:01.866 --> 15:03.734
I WENT THROUGH
THE FRIDGES

15:03.767 --> 15:05.436
AND I WAS
PRETTY DISGUSTED.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.738
BRIAN,
YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY

15:07.771 --> 15:09.974
PAY A LOT MORE RESPECT
TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:10.007 --> 15:11.342
AND THE FIRST THING
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS MORNING,

15:11.375 --> 15:13.711
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,
YEAH,

15:13.744 --> 15:16.113
ALL OF US,
IS WE'RE GONNA CLEAN.

15:16.146 --> 15:16.539
I WAS A LITTLE OFFENDED.

15:16.539 --> 15:17.681
I WAS A LITTLE OFFENDED.

15:17.715 --> 15:19.083
I ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF

15:19.116 --> 15:20.684
TO HAVE
A PRETTY CLEAN KITCHEN.

15:20.718 --> 15:22.319
ME, YOU, AND YOU
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN THE KITCHEN.

15:22.353 --> 15:23.420
YEAH?

15:23.454 --> 15:24.421
EVERYWHERE, YES?

15:24.455 --> 15:25.890
IT PISSED ME OFF.

15:25.923 --> 15:27.291
I DON'T DIRTY THAT KITCHEN.

15:27.324 --> 15:28.926
I DON'T COOK
IN THAT KITCHEN.

15:28.959 --> 15:31.395
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
INTO HIS KITCHEN AND CLEAN IT.

15:31.428 --> 15:32.997
GET THAT PULLED OUT.

15:33.030 --> 15:34.999
ALL SOAKED AND WE GET
ALL THESE CLEAN AND IN.

15:35.032 --> 15:37.534
QUITE FRANKLY, I THOUGHT
WE WERE PRETTY CLEAN.

15:37.568 --> 15:39.069
CLEAN.

15:39.103 --> 15:41.438
IT WAS, UH,
IT WAS FRUSTRATING.

15:41.472 --> 15:43.607
AND, UH,
DEFINITELY EMBARRASSING.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.943
BUT EVEN CHEF RAMSAY HAD SOME
GLOVES ON, HE WAS CLEANING.

15:45.976 --> 15:46.539
I THINK THAT WAS MORE
IMPRESSIVE THAN ANYTHING,

15:46.539 --> 15:47.344
I THINK THAT WAS MORE
IMPRESSIVE THAN ANYTHING,

15:47.378 --> 15:49.780
TO SEE HIM
BE AS HANDS-ON AS HE WAS.

15:49.813 --> 15:52.016
GUYS, UNDERNEATH THERE.

15:54.685 --> 15:56.720
SPOTLESS.
WHAT A DIFFERENCE.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.561
THE KITCHEN
HAS BEEN CLEANED

16:04.595 --> 16:05.996
JUST IN TIME FOR DINNER.

16:06.030 --> 16:09.533
IF ONLY THERE WERE
SOME CUSTOMERS.

16:09.566 --> 16:11.468
WHEN WE'RE STRUGGLING
LIKE WE ARE NOW,

16:11.502 --> 16:14.738
IT'LL DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

16:14.772 --> 16:16.539
WHY DON'T MORE LOCALS,
YOU KNOW, COME?

16:16.539 --> 16:17.441
WHY DON'T MORE LOCALS,
YOU KNOW, COME?

16:17.474 --> 16:19.843
MAYBE THEY'VE COME HERE
AND HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE

16:19.877 --> 16:22.212
AND DIDN'T WANT
TO COME BACK.

16:27.618 --> 16:30.054
THANKFULLY, THE LOCAL FIREMEN
HAVE DECIDED

16:30.087 --> 16:31.588
TO TAKE GORDON UP
ON HIS INVITATION.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.057
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

16:33.090 --> 16:35.059
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:35.092 --> 16:37.161
IT'S NOW CRUCIAL
THAT CHEF BRIAN

16:37.194 --> 16:38.963
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS OPPORTUNITY

16:38.996 --> 16:40.664
TO IMPRESS
THE LOCAL FIREMEN.

16:44.535 --> 16:45.836
ORDER IN.
YEAH.

16:45.869 --> 16:46.539
WHAT'S THAT?

16:46.539 --> 16:47.004
WHAT'S THAT?

16:47.037 --> 16:48.672
NACHOS.
NACHOS?

16:48.706 --> 16:51.208
ME.

16:51.241 --> 16:52.643
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

16:52.676 --> 16:54.678
YOU GOT FRESH VEGETABLES
IN THE HOUSE?

16:54.712 --> 16:56.947
LAST SUMMER.
LAST SUMMER?

16:56.981 --> 16:59.083
NO, I JUST CRINGE
WHEN I SEE THEM, THAT'S ALL.

16:59.116 --> 17:03.420
I DEVELOPED THE NAME
"CHEF SHORTCUT" FOR HIM

17:03.454 --> 17:05.656
BECAUSE HE JUST CUTS CORNERS.

17:05.689 --> 17:06.790
WHAT ARE THEY, BRIAN?

17:06.824 --> 17:09.493
BAKED CLAM CASSEROLE.

17:09.526 --> 17:11.328
DID YOU BUY THE CLAMS FROZEN?

17:11.362 --> 17:12.329
YOU CAN'T GET FRESH CLAMS?

17:12.363 --> 17:15.132
YES, I CAN.

17:15.165 --> 17:16.539
I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
WITH GORDON

17:16.539 --> 17:16.834
I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
WITH GORDON

17:16.867 --> 17:19.069
HANGING OVER ME,
WATCHING EVERY STEP.

17:19.103 --> 17:20.404
WHEN I'M DOING SOMETHING,

17:20.437 --> 17:22.072
LEAVE ME ALONE
AND LET ME DO IT.

17:27.978 --> 17:30.047
45 MINUTES
INTO DINNER SERVICE

17:30.080 --> 17:32.116
AND THE FIREMEN ARE STILL
WAITING FOR THEIR FOOD.

17:33.984 --> 17:35.753
75% OF THE TIME,
I GO BACK INTO THE KITCHEN,

17:35.786 --> 17:36.987
MY BROTHER'S
ON HIS CELL PHONE.

17:37.021 --> 17:39.023
I SAY,
"HOW ARE YOU COOKING

17:39.056 --> 17:40.958
"AND LOOKING
AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

17:40.991 --> 17:42.593
"HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
BE COOKING AND DOING THIS

17:42.626 --> 17:44.228
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING THERE
CHATTING ON YOUR CELL PHONE?"

17:44.261 --> 17:45.896
WHEN THE FIREMEN
FINALLY DO GET SERVED...

17:45.929 --> 17:46.539
IT'S JUST DRY.

17:46.539 --> 17:47.231
IT'S JUST DRY.

17:47.264 --> 17:48.899
THEY'RE NOT IMPRESSED.

17:48.932 --> 17:51.168
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

17:51.201 --> 17:53.303
UH, BRIAN.

17:53.337 --> 17:56.040
TWO SECONDS, PLEASE.

17:56.073 --> 17:57.741
SO, GUYS, THIS HIS BRIAN,
THE CHEF, YES.

17:57.775 --> 17:59.576
I BELIEVE YOU'VE MET,
NO?

17:59.610 --> 18:00.811
THESE GUYS
ARE YOUR LOCALS.

18:00.844 --> 18:02.146
YES.

18:02.179 --> 18:03.380
I'LL START OFF
WITH YOUR PIE, PLEASE.

18:03.414 --> 18:04.448
HOW WAS IT?

18:04.481 --> 18:05.716
IT WASN'T WARM ENOUGH.

18:17.161 --> 18:18.529
THESE ARE VOLUNTEER FIREMEN.

18:18.562 --> 18:19.463
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

18:19.496 --> 18:20.998
AND FOR SOMEBODY
TO CRITIQUE ME

18:21.031 --> 18:22.866
WHO DOESN'T EVEN REALLY
DO IT FOR A LIVING,

18:22.900 --> 18:26.303
YOU KNOW, FEEL LIKE
TELLING THEM TO SHUT UP.

18:26.336 --> 18:27.638
THANK YOU.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.407
BET YOUR BUTT,
THEY WON'T BE COMING BACK.

18:30.441 --> 18:31.842
SO I WAS JUST LIKE,

18:31.875 --> 18:33.844
"I DON'T SEE HOW THIS
IS GONNA WORK."

18:33.877 --> 18:36.246
AFTER FEELING THE HEAT
OF THE FIREMEN,

18:36.280 --> 18:39.216
BRIAN AND SOUS CHEF FRANCIS
GET BACK TO WORK

18:39.249 --> 18:40.884
UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE
OF GORDON

18:40.918 --> 18:43.387
WHO CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT HE SEES.

18:51.295 --> 18:53.430
FRANCIS.
FRANCIS.

18:53.464 --> 18:55.399
FRANCIS.
FRANCIS.

18:55.432 --> 18:57.401
ME, HE'S DEAF
AS A ING BAT.

18:57.434 --> 18:59.336
FRANCIS, YOU TOOK IT
OFF THE FLOOR

18:59.369 --> 19:01.705
AND PUT IT IN THE FRYER.
AND THEN BACK IN THE SAUCE.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.186
BUT IT FELL ON THE FLOOR.

19:16.220 --> 19:16.539
YOU PUT IT BACK
IN THE FRYER.

19:16.539 --> 19:18.388
YOU PUT IT BACK
IN THE FRYER.

19:18.422 --> 19:21.458
AND THAT CLEANS IT?

19:21.492 --> 19:23.694
STERILIZED IT?

19:23.727 --> 19:25.562
ME.

19:25.596 --> 19:27.397
STERILIZED IT.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.176
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP
EVERYTHING CONSISTENT,

19:39.209 --> 19:40.844
BUT...

19:40.878 --> 19:43.313
SOME THINGS GET MESSED UP
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

19:45.215 --> 19:46.539
WHAT THE
WERE YOU THINKING?

19:46.539 --> 19:47.818
WHAT THE
WERE YOU THINKING?

19:47.851 --> 19:49.853
OH, MY GOD.

19:49.887 --> 19:51.555
I'VE NEVER, EVER, EVER
SEEN ANYTHING

19:51.588 --> 19:53.590
QUITE EXTRAORDINARY
AS THAT.

19:53.624 --> 19:54.925
HE SERVES FOOD OFF THE FLOOR.

19:54.958 --> 19:57.794
AND SERVES IT TO THE CUSTOMER.

19:57.828 --> 19:59.663
OH, MY GOD.
NO.

20:04.368 --> 20:06.069
STILL TO COME...

20:06.103 --> 20:07.604
IF BRIAN WASN'T MY SON,
I'D HAVE FIRED HIM.

20:07.638 --> 20:09.273
GET OUTTA HERE.

20:09.306 --> 20:11.408
A FAMILY FEUD
SENDS BRAIN OVER THE EDGE.

20:11.441 --> 20:13.877
WOULD YOU CARE TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS TICKET THEN?

20:13.911 --> 20:15.646
I'M OUTTA HERE.

20:15.679 --> 20:16.539
COMING UP ON
KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

20:16.539 --> 20:17.514
COMING UP ON
KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

20:22.618 --> 20:24.353
IT'S DAY THREE.

20:24.386 --> 20:26.388
AND KNOWING FULL WELL
THAT FINN McCOOL'S

20:26.421 --> 20:28.824
IS THE LIFE BLOOD
OF THE MAZIO FAMILY,

20:28.857 --> 20:30.793
GORDON IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT
HOW DESPERATE

20:30.826 --> 20:32.761
THE BUSINESS REALLY IS.

20:32.795 --> 20:36.064
IF THERE'S NO SIGNIFICANT
IMPROVEMENT,

20:36.098 --> 20:38.000
HOW LONG COULD YOU AFFORD
TO STAY OPEN FOR?

20:38.033 --> 20:40.068
WE'RE IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

20:40.102 --> 20:41.970
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE PROBABLY

20:42.004 --> 20:43.806
I WOULD SAY $5, 000 A WEEK
OR $4, 000 A WEEK

20:43.839 --> 20:45.340
UNDER WHAT WE NEED
TO SURVIVE.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.642
UNDER?

20:46.675 --> 20:47.676
YEAH.

20:47.709 --> 20:48.911
SO 20 GRAND A MONTH?

20:48.944 --> 20:49.618
YEAH.

20:49.618 --> 20:50.145
YEAH.

20:50.179 --> 20:52.047
JUST RECENTLY TOOK
A LITTLE PERSONAL LOAN

20:52.080 --> 20:54.249
FROM A FRIEND, THEN I'D
PAY HIM BACK, YOU KNOW.

20:54.283 --> 20:55.784
THAT KINDA THING.

20:55.818 --> 20:59.288
JUST TO GET US THROUGH
THIS DREADFUL PERIOD HERE.

20:59.321 --> 21:01.056
I DON'T SLEEP WELL
OWING PEOPLE MONEY.

21:01.089 --> 21:02.691
THAT'S NOT--
THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO.

21:02.724 --> 21:04.459
I HAVEN'T TAKEN
A CHECK YET.

21:04.493 --> 21:06.395
YOU HAVEN'T PAID
YOURSELF YET FROM THE BUSINESS?

21:06.428 --> 21:08.096
I GOT MY CHECKS IN THE SAFE.

21:08.130 --> 21:10.132
GOT A STACK OF 'EM.
CAN WE LOOK AT THEM?

21:11.900 --> 21:12.901
YEAH, EVERYBODY ELSE DOES.

21:12.935 --> 21:14.102
BUT THESE ARE--

21:14.136 --> 21:16.405
YOU CAN'T CASH THEM?

21:16.438 --> 21:18.307
NO. NO.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.618
I'VE NEVER LOST ANYTHING.

21:19.618 --> 21:20.576
I'VE NEVER LOST ANYTHING.

21:20.609 --> 21:23.011
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL.

21:23.045 --> 21:26.815
BUDDY BASICALLY PUT EVERYTHING
INTO THIS PLACE.

21:26.849 --> 21:28.884
BY THIS PLACE NOT DOING
AS GOOD AS HE DREAMED

21:28.917 --> 21:33.255
IS--IS JUST BREAKING HIM.

21:33.288 --> 21:35.123
DIFFICULT HAVING TWO SONS
IN THE BUSINESS.

21:35.157 --> 21:36.425
DO THEY KNOW
THE SITUATION YOU'RE IN?

21:36.458 --> 21:39.094
I THINK JASON
UNDERSTANDS MORE.

21:39.127 --> 21:41.496
BRIAN'S OUT ON AN ISLAND
A LITTLE BIT.

21:41.530 --> 21:44.900
IF BRIAN WASN'T MY SON,
I'D HAVE FIRED HIM.

21:44.933 --> 21:46.535
REALLY?

21:46.568 --> 21:48.670
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK

21:48.704 --> 21:49.618
AND IT DOES CLOSE,

21:49.618 --> 21:52.107
AND IT DOES CLOSE,

21:52.140 --> 21:54.142
WHAT WILL
THE BOYS DO?

21:54.176 --> 21:56.011
THIS IS MY--
YOU KNOW--

21:56.044 --> 21:58.213
OUR ENTIRE FAMILY

21:58.247 --> 21:59.848
LIVES THEIR LIVES
OUTTA THIS.

21:59.882 --> 22:01.350
I CAN FEEL IT.

22:01.383 --> 22:03.485
MY SONS EAT THEIR DINNER
BECAUSE OF FINN McCOOL'S.

22:03.518 --> 22:05.888
YOU KNOW, THEIR HOUSES ARE WARM
BECAUSE OF FINN McCOOL'S.

22:05.921 --> 22:09.124
AND TO THINK THAT
WE WOULD CLOSE,

22:09.157 --> 22:11.193
WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

22:15.697 --> 22:17.232
WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING

22:17.266 --> 22:18.767
OF THE FINANCIAL PICTURE,

22:18.800 --> 22:19.618
GORDON TURNS HIS ATTENTION
TO THE FOOD,

22:19.618 --> 22:21.770
GORDON TURNS HIS ATTENTION
TO THE FOOD,

22:21.803 --> 22:23.472
BEGINNING WITH TEACHING BRIAN

22:23.505 --> 22:25.107
HOW TO MAKE A PROPER
SHEPHERD'S PIE.

22:25.140 --> 22:27.209
BRIAN, GET ME
THE LARGE TRAY

22:27.242 --> 22:28.911
THAT WE PUT
IN THE FRIDGE TO SET,

22:28.944 --> 22:30.345
AND WE'LL PUT
OUR POTATOES ON THERE,

22:30.379 --> 22:31.546
PUT IT IN THE OVEN
FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.448
TO HAVE HIM
COME TO YOUR PLACE

22:33.482 --> 22:35.484
AND SHOW YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD
BE DOING THE RIGHT WAY...

22:35.517 --> 22:36.685
PUT SOME CHEESE ON THERE,
GRILL IT,

22:36.718 --> 22:38.387
AND THEN GET THEM
TO TASTE IT.

22:38.420 --> 22:41.023
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
IT MADE ME LAUGH A LITTLE.

22:41.056 --> 22:42.691
DRAIN OFF THAT FAT.

22:42.724 --> 22:45.060
AND THAT'S WHAT I GOT UPSET
WITH YOU ON THE OTHER DAY.

22:45.093 --> 22:47.195
THAT THERE.
ADD THAT INTO THE MINCE.

22:47.229 --> 22:49.331
INTO THE BOWL.

22:49.364 --> 22:49.618
TO THINK THAT
WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH

22:49.618 --> 22:52.534
TO THINK THAT
WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH

22:52.567 --> 22:55.203
TO BE SCHOOLED
BY A MAN LIKE CHEF RAMSAY,

22:55.237 --> 22:57.239
BOY, YOU'D BE A FOOL
NOT TO JUMP ON THIS.

22:57.272 --> 22:59.074
MMM.

22:59.107 --> 23:02.344
LET'S GO IN THE DINING ROOM,
SHALL WE?

23:02.377 --> 23:03.879
OKAY.

23:03.912 --> 23:07.549
SO I JUST WANT YOU TO
HAVE A LITTLE TASTE

23:07.582 --> 23:09.685
OF FINN McCOOL'S
SHEPHERD'S PIE, YES.

23:09.718 --> 23:12.087
RICH.
GROUND BEEF.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.255
MMM.

23:16.024 --> 23:17.659
OURS ORIGINALLY CERTAINLY

23:17.693 --> 23:19.561
HAD MUCH MORE
OF A BROWN SAUCE TO IT,

23:19.594 --> 23:19.618
AND IT WAS FATTY.

23:19.618 --> 23:21.930
AND IT WAS FATTY.

23:21.964 --> 23:25.834
THEN, GORDON BROUGHT OUT
BRIAN'S OLD SHEPHERD'S PIE.

23:31.306 --> 23:32.874
[chucklingÃ‘

23:32.908 --> 23:35.077
I THOUGHT OUR SHEPHERD'S PIE
WAS HALFWAY DECENT.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.878
IT WASN'T.
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

23:36.912 --> 23:39.348
OUR NEW SHEPHERD'S PIE,
IT'S FANTASTIC.

23:39.381 --> 23:41.049
THIS IS VERY, VERY GOOD.

23:41.083 --> 23:44.052
I COME OUT LOOKING LIKE
THE  OF THE FAMILY.

23:44.086 --> 23:47.990
I WAS, UH,
TREMENDOUSLY PISSED OFF.

23:53.695 --> 23:57.666
AFTER BEING HUMILIATED,
BRIAN GOES TO THE BAR.

23:57.699 --> 23:59.668
HEY, CHEERS, GUYS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

23:59.701 --> 24:01.103
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.641
TAKE IT EASY TODAY.
TAKE IT EASY.

24:06.675 --> 24:08.343
PEOPLE SEE BRIAN

24:08.377 --> 24:10.178
AS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME
ALL HIS LIFE.

24:10.212 --> 24:11.747
IF HE WASN'T MY SON,

24:11.780 --> 24:13.515
I'D FIRED HIS ASS OUTTA HERE.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.550
ALL YOUR BUDDIES
ARE OUTSIDE, BRIAN.

24:19.721 --> 24:21.189
SERIOUSLY.
OKAY.

24:21.223 --> 24:22.557
I'M SERIOUS.
ALL RIGHT.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.760
I'M NOT KIDDING.
I SAID ALL RIGHT.

24:24.793 --> 24:26.862
ENOUGH.

24:26.895 --> 24:28.030
GET LOST.

24:28.063 --> 24:30.132
GET OUTTA HERE.
LET ME DO MY JOB.

24:30.165 --> 24:32.834
STAY BACK HERE
AND DO YOUR JOB.

24:32.868 --> 24:34.603
CHILL OUT.

24:34.636 --> 24:36.271
NOBODY WANTS TO GET YELLED AT

24:36.304 --> 24:37.939
THAT THEY'RE NOT
DOING THEIR JOB PROPERLY.

24:37.973 --> 24:39.541
I'M NOT GONNA
STICK AROUND FOR IT.

24:39.574 --> 24:40.776
WHY ARE YOU STANDING
RIGHT THERE?

24:40.809 --> 24:42.377
I DEFINITELY ONCE AGAIN

24:42.411 --> 24:44.546
FELT LIKE A LITTLE KID
GETTING YELLED AT.

24:44.579 --> 24:46.848
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE
AND DOING WHAT I GOTTA DO.

24:46.882 --> 24:48.183
GET OUTTA HERE.
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

24:48.216 --> 24:49.618
GET OUTTA HERE.

24:49.618 --> 24:49.718
GET OUTTA HERE.

24:49.751 --> 24:51.453
WOULD YOU CARE TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS TICKET THEN?

24:51.486 --> 24:53.622
I DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

24:53.655 --> 24:56.291
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANTED
TO BE IN THE KITCHEN ANYMORE.

25:00.162 --> 25:02.097
I'M DONE WORKING HERE.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.137
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

25:09.171 --> 25:10.672
HE'S STUBBORN AS A MULE.

25:10.705 --> 25:12.140
YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST
ABSOLUTELY STUBBORN.

25:12.174 --> 25:15.744
HE JUST DISAPPEARED.

25:25.752 --> 25:27.387
BRIAN'S DEPARTURE

25:27.421 --> 25:29.089
HAS LEFT THE RESTAURANT
WITHOUT A CHEF.

25:29.122 --> 25:31.325
AND BUDDY IS FORCED
TO RUN THE KITCHEN.

25:31.358 --> 25:33.126
SPRING ROLLS.
SPRING ROLLS.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.261
AND THE SOUP?

25:34.294 --> 25:35.329
THANK YOU.

25:35.362 --> 25:36.997
WHAT'S THAT THERE?
COBB SALAD.

25:37.030 --> 25:38.598
GOOD, SO YOU'RE
AWARE OF THAT.

25:38.632 --> 25:40.200
YOU'VE DONE THAT BEFORE
HAVE YOU?

25:40.233 --> 25:42.569
I'M THINKING,
", DON'T LOOK AT ME."

25:42.602 --> 25:44.037
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M DOING BACK HERE.

25:44.071 --> 25:45.272
WHAT IS THIS?

25:45.305 --> 25:46.873
FASCINATING,
ISN'T IT?

25:46.907 --> 25:48.842
I'M GLAD YOU FIND THAT
DIFFICULT TO READ.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.677
THERE WAS EIGHT TICKETS
ON THE BOARD.

25:50.711 --> 25:50.753
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TICKETS WERE UP.

25:50.753 --> 25:53.347
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TICKETS WERE UP.

25:53.380 --> 25:55.148
BUDDY, BUDDY, BUDDY,
NO, NO, NO.

25:55.182 --> 25:56.750
BUDDY, YOU HAVE TO
TAKE SOME OUT, MY MAN.

25:56.783 --> 25:58.018
IT LOOKS LIKE
A CROCK OF.

25:58.051 --> 26:01.555
START AGAIN.

26:01.588 --> 26:05.192
BUDDY, YOU HAPPY TO HAVE
BACON THERE LIKE THAT?

26:05.225 --> 26:06.193
LOOKS.

26:06.226 --> 26:07.461
LOOKS LIKE.

26:07.494 --> 26:09.363
COME ON, BIG BOY.
STANDARDS.

26:09.396 --> 26:11.231
THAT'S BETTER.
SERVICE, PLEASE.

26:19.039 --> 26:20.007
WHAT?
SORRY?

26:20.040 --> 26:20.753
TOP TO THE BUN.

26:20.753 --> 26:21.408
TOP TO THE BUN.

26:21.441 --> 26:23.410
TOP TO THE BUN.
WE ONLY SENT HALF OF IT OUT.

26:23.443 --> 26:25.078
THERE WAS NO BUN
ON THAT.

26:25.112 --> 26:26.580
LET'S PUT IT ON STRAIGHT AWAY.
WE'LL ARGUE AFTER.

26:32.819 --> 26:34.421
IS THAT ORDER,

26:34.454 --> 26:36.323
SHEPHERD'S PIE FOR SIX,
COMING TO THEM?

26:39.359 --> 26:40.927
BUDDY CAN'T EVEN FIND
A ING DOILY,

26:40.961 --> 26:41.895
LET ALONE COOK A FLOUNDER.

26:41.928 --> 26:43.330
SWEATING, DRIPPING.

26:43.363 --> 26:45.265
NOW, SMASHING PLATES.
HIS OWN PLATES.

26:53.006 --> 26:55.175
IT'S DAY FOUR,

26:55.208 --> 26:56.610
AND BRIAN'S LOYALTY
TO HIS FAMILY

26:56.643 --> 26:58.845
BRINGS HIM BACK TO WORK.

26:58.879 --> 27:01.948
YOU GET RENEWED RESPECT FOR
WHAT BRIAN HAS TO GO THROUGH.

27:01.982 --> 27:03.650
IT'S A TOUGH JOB.
IT'S TOUGH.

27:03.683 --> 27:05.419
GET THAT
MOZZARELLA STICK GOING.

27:05.452 --> 27:08.155
I GAINED A LOT MORE RESPECT
FOR MY BROTHER.

27:08.188 --> 27:10.157
AND ALL THESE TIMES
THAT I'M HARD ON HIM

27:10.190 --> 27:12.492
AND I GET ANGRY AT HIM
AND WE FIGHT ABOUT STUFF,

27:12.526 --> 27:14.628
I COULDN'T DO
WHAT HE DOES.

27:14.661 --> 27:17.597
WITH A NEW APPRECIATION
FOR BRIAN,

27:17.631 --> 27:20.753
GORDON DECIDES TO SPEND
SOME ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH HIM.

27:20.753 --> 27:21.635
GORDON DECIDES TO SPEND
SOME ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH HIM.

27:21.668 --> 27:23.336
I KNEW YOU WERE
AN ANGRY CHEF,

27:23.370 --> 27:24.805
FRUSTRATED, PISSED OFF
WITH YOUR DAD.

27:24.838 --> 27:26.540
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
YOU HAD ON YOUR SHOULDERS

27:26.573 --> 27:28.642
BEFORE I WALKED IN HERE.

27:28.675 --> 27:30.677
THERE'S PARTS OF ME
THAT FEEL FOR YOU IN WAY

27:30.710 --> 27:32.913
THAT I--
I'VE STARTED TO UNDERSTAND

27:32.946 --> 27:34.548
WHAT'S ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

27:34.581 --> 27:36.416
WHEN YOU'D GET
PISSED AND FRUSTRATED,

27:36.450 --> 27:37.517
WHO'D YOU TALK TO?

27:37.551 --> 27:38.885
WHO DO YOU
OWN UP TO?

27:38.919 --> 27:40.687
I'M NOT GONNA
GRIPE TO MY LITTLE ONE.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.155
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT QUITTING

27:42.189 --> 27:45.225
AND SETTING UP
ELSEWHERE?

27:45.258 --> 27:46.860
OH, CONSTANTLY.

27:46.893 --> 27:48.695
YEAH?
YEAH.

27:48.728 --> 27:50.664
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT
YOUR ROLE IS ENOUGH.

27:50.697 --> 27:50.753
I'VE PROBABLY
FADED OUT A LITTLE BIT

27:50.753 --> 27:52.499
I'VE PROBABLY
FADED OUT A LITTLE BIT

27:52.532 --> 27:56.002
IN STEPPING UP MY GAME
TO WHERE IT USED TO BE.

27:56.036 --> 27:58.338
SO I MIGHT HAVE LOST
SOME OF THE PASSION,

27:58.371 --> 28:00.407
WHICH IS SAD
TO SAY THAT

28:00.440 --> 28:02.275
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THAT,
BUT NOW IT'S KINDA

28:02.309 --> 28:03.977
OPENED MY EYES
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.

28:04.010 --> 28:05.779
YOU COULDA HANDLED IT
A DIFFERENT WAY.

28:05.812 --> 28:09.449
IN A WAY THAT YOU BECOME
THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

28:09.483 --> 28:11.251
AND ING FOCUS.

28:11.284 --> 28:14.488
IF YOU GET
SECURITY OF YOUR FOOD

28:14.521 --> 28:16.123
AND YOU MAKE
THIS PLACE ROCK,

28:16.156 --> 28:17.657
I PROMISE YOU
THAT'S GONNA GIVE YOU

28:17.691 --> 28:19.626
STABILITY
TO RUN THIS BUSINESS

28:19.659 --> 28:20.753
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

28:20.753 --> 28:21.261
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

28:21.294 --> 28:22.262
OKAY?

28:22.295 --> 28:23.797
THANK YOU.
GOOD MAN.

28:23.830 --> 28:26.233
CHEF RAMSAY DEFINITELY
KICKED ME IN THE ASS

28:26.266 --> 28:30.036
AND GOT ME EXCITED
TO DO WHAT I'M DOING.

28:30.070 --> 28:31.705
WHILE GORDON HAS BEEN DEALING

28:31.738 --> 28:33.507
WITH THE FAMILY'S ISSUES,

28:33.540 --> 28:36.109
HIS DESIGN TEAM HAS BEEN
SPRUCING UP THE RESTAURANT

28:36.143 --> 28:39.412
IN ANTICIPATION
OF THE RELAUNCH.

28:39.446 --> 28:40.447
OH, MY GOSH.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.748
YOU WALKED IN

28:41.781 --> 28:43.083
AND YOU FELT LIKE
YOU WERE IN A HOME.

28:43.116 --> 28:44.751
IT WAS SO COMFORTABLE.

28:44.784 --> 28:45.752
BIGGER.

28:45.785 --> 28:47.320
HOLY MOSES.

28:47.354 --> 28:48.522
OH, LOOK AT THE BOOTHS.

28:48.555 --> 28:50.223
WARMER?

28:50.257 --> 28:50.753
YEAH.

28:50.753 --> 28:51.358
YEAH.

28:51.391 --> 28:52.359
WOW.

28:52.392 --> 28:53.560
I'M IN SHOCK.

28:53.593 --> 28:55.896
I'M NEVER
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.

28:55.929 --> 28:57.197
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS OVERWHELMING.

28:57.230 --> 28:58.732
GORGEOUS.

28:58.765 --> 29:00.400
FOR BUDDY,
THIS WAS HIS BIG DREAM.

29:00.433 --> 29:02.202
IT WAS VERY COOL SEEING THAT,

29:02.235 --> 29:03.403
JUST THE LOOK ON HIS FACE
WHEN WE WALKED IN THERE.

29:03.436 --> 29:04.404
WOW.

29:04.437 --> 29:06.573
I'M HAPPY.

29:06.606 --> 29:09.142
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A GIFT.

29:09.176 --> 29:10.510
NOW IT'S OUR JOB
TO MAKE THIS WORK,

29:10.544 --> 29:11.444
AND WE CERTAINLY WILL.

29:11.478 --> 29:12.445
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

29:12.479 --> 29:13.446
HOLY MOSES.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.748
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

29:14.781 --> 29:16.216
CHEF RAMSAY ASKED US

29:16.249 --> 29:18.985
TO HANG OUTSIDE
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

29:19.019 --> 29:20.753
SOMETHING YOU'VE
ALWAYS, ALWAYS WANTED.

29:20.753 --> 29:21.121
SOMETHING YOU'VE
ALWAYS, ALWAYS WANTED.

29:21.154 --> 29:24.124
NEVER HAD.

29:24.157 --> 29:27.794
WELCOME TO FINN McCOOL'S,
YES?

29:27.827 --> 29:28.828
LOVELY.

29:28.862 --> 29:30.697
ESTABLISHED 2006.

29:30.730 --> 29:31.898
FAMILY RESTAURANT.

29:31.932 --> 29:33.266
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

29:33.300 --> 29:34.834
THAT IS GORGEOUS.

29:34.868 --> 29:36.937
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL SIGN
RIGHT THERE.

29:36.970 --> 29:39.773
YOU CAN SEE THAT
FROM 100 METERS, RIGHT?

29:39.806 --> 29:41.608
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WOULD GO TO THAT EXTENT

29:41.641 --> 29:43.343
AND REALLY GO
THAT EXTRA MILE FOR US.

29:43.376 --> 29:44.744
YOU CAN'T MISS THIS.

29:44.778 --> 29:46.012
IT'S TOUGH TO PUT INTO WORDS

29:46.046 --> 29:47.614
HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO ME

29:47.647 --> 29:49.282
AND THE REST
OF MY FAMILY.

29:49.316 --> 29:50.753
BUDDY,
HAPPY WITH THE COLOR?

29:50.753 --> 29:50.884
BUDDY,
HAPPY WITH THE COLOR?

29:50.917 --> 29:52.619
HOLY MOSES.
LOOK AT IT.

29:52.652 --> 29:54.721
IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.

29:54.754 --> 29:56.590
WE WERE ALL GETTING
TEARY EYED.

29:56.623 --> 30:00.794
AND THE FOUR OF US
WERE JUST IN AWE.

30:00.827 --> 30:02.462
AT LEAST,
WHEN YOU DRIVE BY NOW,

30:02.495 --> 30:03.530
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

30:03.563 --> 30:06.199
AMEN.

30:06.233 --> 30:08.034
I'M THANKFUL
AS AN OWNER OF A RESTAURANT.

30:08.068 --> 30:11.404
BUT I'M ALSO THANKFUL
AS A DAD.

30:11.438 --> 30:13.106
ALTHOUGH FINN McCOOL'S

30:13.139 --> 30:14.841
HAS A NEW SIGN
AND A NEW LOOK,

30:14.874 --> 30:17.310
IT'S THE FOOD
THAT BRINGS IN THE CUSTOMERS.

30:17.344 --> 30:19.379
THE FIRST THING I DID
WAS GOT RID OF 2/3 OF THE MENU

30:19.412 --> 30:20.753
THE MAJORITY
OF IT WAS FROZEN.

30:20.753 --> 30:21.581
THE MAJORITY
OF IT WAS FROZEN.

30:21.615 --> 30:22.983
IT WASN'T FRESH.

30:23.016 --> 30:24.618
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING IT ON THERE?

30:24.651 --> 30:25.819
WHATEVER COMES OUT OF HERE
HAS MY NAME ON IT,

30:25.852 --> 30:27.454
AND I DON'T WANNA
MESS THIS UP.

30:27.487 --> 30:29.189
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE
WITH THE SEASONS.

30:29.222 --> 30:30.657
GET RID OF THE DARK
HEAVY SAUCES

30:30.690 --> 30:32.058
AND LIGHTEN UP
A LITTLE BIT.

30:32.092 --> 30:33.727
GORDON'S NEW MENU

30:33.760 --> 30:35.695
OF CONTEMPORARY PUB FOOD
INCLUDES...

30:35.729 --> 30:37.230
THE GUINNESS PUB BURGER.

30:37.264 --> 30:39.032
AND GORDON'S OWN FAMILY RECIPE

30:39.065 --> 30:40.300
FOR SHEPHERD'S PIE.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.936
AND THEN
THE FIREMAN'S CHICKEN.

30:42.969 --> 30:44.204
CHEF RAMSAY
DUMPED THE FRIED FOODS.

30:44.237 --> 30:45.772
THEY'RE GONE.

30:45.805 --> 30:47.941
AND TO GIVE THE RESTAURANT
A NEW ENERGY

30:47.974 --> 30:49.676
AND TO TAKE SOME PRESSURE
OFF BRIAN IN THE KITCHEN,

30:49.709 --> 30:50.753
GORDON HAS INTRODUCED
TABLESIDE SERVICE.

30:50.753 --> 30:52.579
GORDON HAS INTRODUCED
TABLESIDE SERVICE.

30:52.612 --> 30:54.948
TONIGHT YOU'RE GONNA BE
ROASTING A CHICKEN.

30:54.981 --> 30:56.416
YOU ROAST IT
IN THE KITCHEN.

30:56.449 --> 30:57.717
I'M GONNA
CUT IT TABLESIDE.

30:57.751 --> 30:59.119
DON'T BE NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

30:59.152 --> 31:00.320
I CAN SEE IT
ON YOUR FACE ALREADY.

31:00.353 --> 31:02.422
I'M A LITTLE--
DON'T.

31:02.455 --> 31:04.224
IT CREATES A BUZZ
IN THE DINING ROOM.

31:04.257 --> 31:05.358
AND IT CREATES A BIT
OF AN EXCITEMENT.

31:05.392 --> 31:07.394
READY?
LET'S GO.

31:07.427 --> 31:10.930
OKAY, YOU AND I
IN THE KITCHEN, LET'S GO.

31:10.964 --> 31:12.732
LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT IN THIS LAST WEEK.

31:12.766 --> 31:14.067
IT'S BEEN AMAZING.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.136
YOU KNOW,
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT.

31:16.169 --> 31:18.405
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS
THAT WE'VE DONE WRONG.

31:18.438 --> 31:19.706
WE WERE TAUGHT A LOT OF THINGS
AND HOW TO DO THINGS RIGHT.

31:19.739 --> 31:20.753
WE CAN COME OUT
OF THE BLOCKS TODAY

31:20.753 --> 31:21.608
WE CAN COME OUT
OF THE BLOCKS TODAY

31:21.641 --> 31:23.310
AND PEOPLE
CAN LEAVE HERE SAYING,

31:23.343 --> 31:25.412
"OH, MY GOD,
WHAT A PLACE,"

31:25.445 --> 31:27.013
THIS IS HUGE.

31:27.047 --> 31:28.615
THIS IS A GRAND OPENING.

31:28.648 --> 31:30.116
SMILE,
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL--

31:30.150 --> 31:31.785
LOOK AT ME.
HAVE FUN.

31:31.818 --> 31:33.820
LET'S KICK THIS IN THE ASS.
MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

31:33.853 --> 31:35.789
THAT'S ALL.
DO IT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

31:35.822 --> 31:37.023
ANYBODY HAVE
ANY ISSUES?

31:37.057 --> 31:38.425
DO WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES?

31:38.458 --> 31:39.826
FIVE MINUTES.
GO COMPOSE.

31:39.859 --> 31:42.429
GO COMPOSE.
HURRY UP.

31:42.462 --> 31:44.964
THE NEWS OF GORDON RAMSAY'S
NEW MENU

31:44.998 --> 31:46.733
HAS SPREAD THROUGH THE TOWN,

31:46.766 --> 31:49.769
AND THE RESTAURANT
IS FULLY BOOKED FOR RELAUNCH.

31:49.803 --> 31:50.753
ALL RIGHT, COME ON IN.

31:50.753 --> 31:51.504
ALL RIGHT, COME ON IN.

31:51.538 --> 31:53.173
GORDON ALSO
PERSUADED THE FIREMEN

31:53.206 --> 31:55.075
TO GIVE FINN McCOOL'S
ANOTHER CHANCE.

31:55.108 --> 31:56.376
DON'T LOOK SO NERVOUS.

31:56.409 --> 31:58.244
JUST SMILE.

31:58.278 --> 31:59.979
EVEN WHEN IT'S GOING WRONG,
SMILE, OKAY?

32:00.013 --> 32:01.114
THIS TABLE RIGHT HERE.

32:01.147 --> 32:02.315
FIVE WITH A HIGH CHAIR.

32:02.349 --> 32:03.717
FIVE AND A HIGH CHAIR.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.353
THIS IS THEIR
ONE BIG LAST CHANCE

32:06.386 --> 32:07.754
OF GETTING THIS THING RIGHT.

32:07.787 --> 32:09.489
WELCOME TO FINN McCOOL'S.

32:09.522 --> 32:10.924
MY NAME IS MELISSA, AND I'LL
BE YOUR WAITRESS TONIGHT.

32:10.957 --> 32:12.325
THIS IS OUR BIG CHANCE.

32:12.359 --> 32:13.693
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
IS COMING HERE.

32:13.727 --> 32:15.562
YOU WANT A BIG ONE
OR A REGULAR?

32:15.595 --> 32:17.297
I AM FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS.

32:17.330 --> 32:18.998
THIS IS WHAT YOU LIVE FOR.
TONIGHT IS A GOOD THING.

32:19.032 --> 32:20.753
BRIAN, CAN I PLEASE
PUT A TICKET IN?

32:20.753 --> 32:20.800
BRIAN, CAN I PLEASE
PUT A TICKET IN?

32:20.834 --> 32:22.535
I'M THINKING,
"ALL RIGHT, WELL,

32:22.569 --> 32:23.603
I GOTTA HAVE THIS,
I GOTTA HAVE THIS."

32:23.636 --> 32:25.171
AND THEN I DIDN'T HAVE TIME

32:25.205 --> 32:26.906
TO THINK OF WHAT
I GOTTA HAVE ANYMORE

32:26.940 --> 32:27.874
BECAUSE THE TICKETS
STARTED COMING.

32:27.907 --> 32:29.275
WOULD YOU LIKE A BOOTH?

32:29.309 --> 32:30.377
THAT WOULD BE GREAT,
THANK YOU.

32:30.410 --> 32:34.047
WE OPENED UP THE FLOOD GATES.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.515
WHAT'S ALL THIS FOOD
DOING OUT THERE?

32:35.548 --> 32:36.282
WHERE'S THIS GOING?

32:36.316 --> 32:37.384
OH, MAN.

32:37.417 --> 32:41.287
WHOO.

32:50.963 --> 32:53.765
IT'S A HUGE NIGHT
AT FINN McCOOL'S.

32:53.799 --> 32:56.802
THE LOCALS HAVE COME OUT
AND THE PLACE IS PACKED.

32:56.835 --> 32:59.605
TONIGHT IS WITHOUT QUESTION
A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY

32:59.638 --> 33:02.007
FOR THE MAZIO FAMILY.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.042
BUT IF IT DOESN'T GO WELL,

33:04.076 --> 33:05.310
IT COULD BE
A GOOD-BYE PARTY

33:05.344 --> 33:07.312
INSTEAD OF A RELAUNCH.

33:07.346 --> 33:08.914
TONIGHT IS THE WHOLE NEW MENU.

33:08.947 --> 33:10.849
WE HAVE A LOT
OF WONDERFUL THINGS ON THERE.

33:12.651 --> 33:14.586
CAN I GET THE OYSTERS
ON THE HALF SHELL?

33:14.620 --> 33:15.897
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANY SLOPPY ING BOWLS.

33:15.897 --> 33:16.855
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANY SLOPPY ING BOWLS.

33:16.888 --> 33:18.991
I WANT NICE, CLEAN BOWLS,
NICE, COOKED FOOD, AND JUST--

33:19.024 --> 33:20.392
PRIDE TONIGHT.

33:20.425 --> 33:21.927
ALL ABOUT

WE HAVE GOT ONE BIG CHANCE,

33:34.973 --> 33:37.843
AND THEY HAVE GOT
TO GET IT RIGHT.

33:37.876 --> 33:40.078
ADDING TO THE PRESSURE
ON THE KITCHEN

33:40.112 --> 33:43.448
IS THE PRESENCE

33:43.482 --> 33:45.017
THIS FOOD CRITIC

IT'S A LOCAL PAPER,

34:01.566 --> 34:02.968
WE'RE REVIEWING
THE RESTAURANT.

34:03.001 --> 34:04.369
THEY WANT A GOOD REVIEW,
THEY SHOULD GIVE US A TABLE.

34:04.403 --> 34:06.571
YOU'VE LOST YOUR SMILE.
GO ON.

34:06.605 --> 34:08.140
I KNOW, RICE PUDDING.

34:08.173 --> 34:10.509

34:10.542 --> 34:12.144
UH, YES.

34:12.177 --> 34:14.212
AND START SMILING.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR SMILE.

34:14.246 --> 34:15.380
CHEF IS TELLING ME,
"YOU'RE LOSING YOUR SMILE,

34:15.414 --> 34:15.897
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR SMILE."

34:15.897 --> 34:16.648
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR SMILE."

34:16.682 --> 34:18.350
HOW THE HELL
COULD I SMILE RIGHT NOW?

34:18.383 --> 34:20.252
THEY'VE ALL BEEN THERE
ONE HOUR, 45 MINUTES.

34:20.285 --> 34:21.653
I NEED THE TABLE BACK,
YES?
ABSOLUTELY.

34:21.687 --> 34:23.355
I'M LIKE,
"OH, MY GOSH.

34:23.388 --> 34:25.257
PLEASE DON'T YELL AT ME
RIGHT NOW, 'CAUSE I'LL CRY

34:25.290 --> 34:26.725
AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GO OVER TO MY TABLE

34:26.758 --> 34:28.727
AND TOSS A SALAD
WHILE I'M CRYING.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.362
I FORGOT
MY CAESAR DRESSING.

34:30.395 --> 34:31.630
CAN YOU GET ME
A THING OF CAESAR DRESSING?

34:31.663 --> 34:32.998
SURE.

34:33.031 --> 34:34.866
BRIAN, DO YOU HAVE
THE CAESAR DRESSING OR DO WE?

34:34.900 --> 34:35.934
THEY SHOULD HAVE IT.

34:35.967 --> 34:37.302
OKAY.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.738
KEEP AN EYE
ON THE SALAD FOR ME.

34:39.771 --> 34:41.673
I'M GONNA RUN
AND GRAB IT MYSELF.

34:41.707 --> 34:43.909
IT WAS JUST--
IT WAS NERVE-RACKING.

34:43.942 --> 34:45.277
I'M RUNNING AROUND

34:45.310 --> 34:45.897
LIKE A CHICKEN
WITH ITS HEAD CUT OFF.

34:45.897 --> 34:46.645
LIKE A CHICKEN
WITH ITS HEAD CUT OFF.

34:46.678 --> 34:48.447
WHERE IS THE CAESAR DRESSING?

34:48.480 --> 34:50.349
HOW COULD YOU GO TO A TABLE
WITHOUT THE DRESSING?

34:50.382 --> 34:51.416
WHERE IS THE DRESSING?
HAVE YOU GOT IT, BUDDY?

34:51.450 --> 34:52.818
I KNOW,
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS.

34:52.851 --> 34:54.386
GOT SOME, RIGHT HERE.

34:54.419 --> 34:55.654
MY BAD.
MY HAD.

34:55.687 --> 34:56.888
WHILE THE KITCHEN

34:56.922 --> 34:58.056
IS OVERWHELMED,

34:58.090 --> 35:00.192
THE CUSTOMERS ARE RESTLESS.

35:00.225 --> 35:01.827
I WOULD THINK WITHIN
OVER AN HOUR,

35:01.860 --> 35:03.528
WE WOULD HAVE OUR FOOD
ON THE TABLE.

35:03.562 --> 35:05.197
WHILE PEOPLE
IN THE DINING ROOM

35:05.230 --> 35:07.165
ARE WAITING A LONG TIME
FOR THEIR FOOD...

35:09.267 --> 35:11.103
THE FIRE CHIEF
IS YET TO BE SEATED.

35:11.136 --> 35:12.738
I THINK WE ORDERED
BEFORE THEM.

35:12.771 --> 35:14.306
THEY'RE A LITTLE OVERCROWDED

35:14.339 --> 35:15.897
FOR THE FIRE CODES,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

35:15.897 --> 35:16.408
FOR THE FIRE CODES,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

35:16.441 --> 35:18.377
EVERY PLATE
IS IMPORTANT TONIGHT.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.212
EVERY OYSTER, EVERY PLATE,
EVERY CUSTOMER, YES?

35:20.245 --> 35:22.748
BE REALLY CAREFUL,
BECAUSE THIS IS EXTREMELY HOT.

35:22.781 --> 35:24.816
IT WAS FRUSTRATING
FOR SURE

35:24.850 --> 35:26.418
AND DEFINITELY EMBARRASSING.

35:26.451 --> 35:29.821
PRETTY MUCH
A THREE RING CIRCUS BROKE OUT.

35:29.855 --> 35:31.323
CAN I HAVE HALF A LEMON

35:31.356 --> 35:32.824
RATHER THAN SALAD
ON THERE PLEASE, YEAH?

35:32.858 --> 35:34.459
JUST A HALF A LEMON.
CUT IT IN HALF.

35:34.493 --> 35:35.994
ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

35:36.027 --> 35:37.596
I'M GETTING PISSED NOW, YEAH?
LET'S GO.

35:37.629 --> 35:39.197
WHEN CHEF RAMSAY'S
SCREAMING AT ME...

35:39.231 --> 35:40.031
DON'T GET
WITH ME.

35:40.065 --> 35:41.433
I DEFINITELY ONCE AGAIN

35:41.466 --> 35:44.870
FELT LIKE A LITTLE KID
GETTING YELLED AT.

35:44.903 --> 35:45.897
I'VE SEEN YOU WORK
FASTER THAN THIS.

35:45.897 --> 35:46.338
I'VE SEEN YOU WORK
FASTER THAN THIS.

35:46.371 --> 35:47.439
YES, IT'S A NEW MENU,

35:47.472 --> 35:49.307
BUT YOU CAN MOVE
FASTER HERE LET'S GO.

35:49.341 --> 35:51.376
TWO POT PIES, A STEW,
AND A SHEPHERD'S PIE.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.378
COME ON, BUDDY.
COME ON, COME ON.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.847
HURRY.

THANK YOU.

35:57.149 --> 35:58.483

BRIAN, YEAH?

36:00.552 --> 36:03.455
BUDDY, THAT'S FOR
YOUR CHICKEN.

36:03.488 --> 36:05.157
BUDDY IS NERVOUS
ABOUT GOING AROUND

36:05.190 --> 36:06.425
AND CARVING UP
THOSE CHICKENS TONIGHT.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.360
ALMOST THE ONE
THAT GO AWAY.

36:08.393 --> 36:10.028
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

36:10.061 --> 36:11.596
WHILE BRIAN TRIES

36:11.630 --> 36:12.798
TO KEEP THE KITCHEN
UNDER CONTROL.

36:12.831 --> 36:14.866
JASON IS BUSY
PUTTING OUT FIRES

36:14.900 --> 36:15.897
IN THE DINING ROOM.

36:15.897 --> 36:16.401
IN THE DINING ROOM.

36:16.435 --> 36:17.536
I APOLOGIZE.

36:17.569 --> 36:19.070
HE'S WORKING
ON A BRAND NEW MENU

36:19.104 --> 36:20.238
WITH A PACKED DINING ROOM
ALL AT ONCE.

36:27.112 --> 36:29.214
FOOD CRITIC JUST STARTED GIVING
YOUR BROTHER SOME.

36:29.247 --> 36:30.816
SO, HEY, PROVE THEM WRONG.
COME ON.

36:32.384 --> 36:35.821
I WOULD LOVE
A REVIEW.

36:35.854 --> 36:38.356
WE'RE SERIOUSLY
IN THE  NOW.

36:38.390 --> 36:39.891
THE BAR
IS COMPLETELY BLOCKED.

36:39.925 --> 36:41.593
AND JASON'S
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

36:41.626 --> 36:43.128
HE'S NOW GETTING
FROM CUSTOMERS.

36:43.161 --> 36:44.996
WE'VE GOT
TO TURN THOSE TABLES.

36:45.030 --> 36:45.897
THIS IS THE CRITICAL POINT
OF THIS RESTAURANT.

36:45.897 --> 36:46.364
THIS IS THE CRITICAL POINT
OF THIS RESTAURANT.

36:46.398 --> 36:47.432
THEY'VE GOT TURN THIS.

36:47.466 --> 36:48.800
WAKE UP AND SPEED UP.

36:48.834 --> 36:50.735
SHE ASKED, HONEST OPINION,

36:50.769 --> 36:53.738
SHOULD I TELL PEOPLE AT THE BAR
THEY MIGHT NOT EAT TONIGHT?

36:53.772 --> 36:55.240
WE'RE GOING, WE'RE GOING.

36:55.273 --> 36:56.741
I'VE SEEN YOU WORK
FASTER THAN THIS.

36:56.775 --> 36:58.410
YOU GOTTA ING
IGNITE THAT FIRE, YEAH.

36:58.443 --> 37:00.512
WE'RE OKAY.
COME ON.

37:00.545 --> 37:02.914
THERE'S 60 PLUS PEOPLE HERE
THAT ARE PISSED OFF

37:02.948 --> 37:05.550
AT THE CHIEF
FOR GETTING THEM HERE TONIGHT

37:05.584 --> 37:07.319
AND IT AIN'T RIGHT.

37:07.352 --> 37:09.087
IT WAS TOUGH, IT WAS TOUGH.
PEOPLE WERE GETTING ANGRY.

37:09.120 --> 37:12.824
I'M PISSED.
I'M LEAVING.

37:12.858 --> 37:14.526
WHAT CHEF RAMSAY SAW

37:14.559 --> 37:15.897
WAS A DINING ROOM
THAT WAS A DISASTER.

37:15.897 --> 37:18.363
WAS A DINING ROOM
THAT WAS A DISASTER.

37:18.396 --> 37:19.631
IT WAS A HORROR SHOW.

37:19.664 --> 37:21.733
AN ABSOLUTE HORROR SHOW.

37:30.306 --> 37:31.975
COME ON, BRIAN, YOU'VE GOT
TO STEP UP NOW, MY MAN.

37:32.008 --> 37:33.777
SHE ASKED, HONEST OPINION,

37:33.810 --> 37:35.745
SHOULD I TELL PEOPLE AT THE BAR
THEY MIGHT NOT EAT TONIGHT?

37:35.779 --> 37:40.550
OUR RESTAURANT
WAS OVERWHELMED.

37:40.583 --> 37:42.919
WITH THE DINING ROOM
IN DISARRAY

37:42.952 --> 37:45.722
AND THE KITCHEN IN CHAOS,
GORDON STEPS IN.

37:45.755 --> 37:48.158
COME HERE.

37:48.191 --> 37:49.926
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE CONTROL
OF YOUR KITCHEN NOW.

37:49.959 --> 37:50.994
LET'S LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,

37:51.027 --> 37:52.061
WE HAVE TO WORK,

37:52.095 --> 37:53.563
I MEAN,
REALLY DIG DEEP

37:53.596 --> 37:55.231
TO GET THESE LOCALS
BACK ON OUR SIDE.

37:55.265 --> 37:57.112
SO DON'T DISINTEGRATE.

37:57.112 --> 37:57.167
SO DON'T DISINTEGRATE.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.601
AND THE QUICKER
YOU GET UP TO SPEED

37:58.635 --> 38:00.437
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

38:00.470 --> 38:02.372
THIS WHOLE THING'S GONNA
START GELLING A LOT QUICKER.

38:02.405 --> 38:03.840
I GOT A LITTLE DISHEARTENED,
AT FIRST,

38:03.873 --> 38:05.074
HOW IT WAS TURNING OUT.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.609
BUT CHEF RAMSAY WANTED ME

38:06.643 --> 38:08.278
TO BE ABLE TO SHOW
THAT I COULD DO IT.

38:08.311 --> 38:09.279
GIVE IT SOME FIRE.

38:09.312 --> 38:11.681
LET'S GO.

38:11.714 --> 38:13.983
THE FAMILY BEGINS
TO GET IT TOGETHER.

38:14.017 --> 38:17.287
AND THE FOOD IS ONCE AGAIN
LEAVING THE KITCHEN.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.389
BUT THEY FACE
ANOTHER CRITICAL TEST--

38:19.422 --> 38:20.824
THE FOOD CRITIC.

38:20.857 --> 38:22.292
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND

38:22.325 --> 38:24.027
THE CHICKEN
OR THE SHEPHERD'S PIE TONIGHT.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.462
OKAY?

38:25.495 --> 38:27.112
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
THE POTATO AND BACON

38:27.112 --> 38:28.131
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
THE POTATO AND BACON

38:28.164 --> 38:30.333
OR THE MULLIGATAWNY
WHAT WOULD I GET?

38:30.366 --> 38:32.268
MULLIGATAWNY.
ALL RIGHT.

38:32.302 --> 38:33.470
LET'S GET BREAKFAST STEW.

38:33.503 --> 38:34.671
SHEPHERD'S PIE.

38:34.704 --> 38:36.172
BRI, I HAVE THAT ORDER
IN NOW.

38:36.206 --> 38:37.173
PERFECT.

38:37.207 --> 38:38.741
EVERY CUSTOMER'S YOUR CRITIC.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.711
BUT THIS ONE
IS A FOOD CRITIC, YEAH?

38:43.813 --> 38:46.049
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE DELAY.

38:46.082 --> 38:48.651
THE SHEPHERD'S PIE
IS EXCELLENT.

38:48.685 --> 38:50.687
ANY PROBLEMS, JUST THROW
A GLASS AT SOMEONE.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.188
OKAY.

38:52.222 --> 38:54.624
WHY DON'T I TAKE THIS
AND YOU TAKE THAT?

38:54.657 --> 38:55.992
BUT I HAVE
TO TAKE THIS TOO.

38:56.025 --> 38:57.112
I CAN TAKE THAT.
OKAY.

38:57.112 --> 38:57.260
I CAN TAKE THAT.
OKAY.

39:00.897 --> 39:04.667
BE VERY CAREFUL
NOT TO TOUCH THAT.

39:06.202 --> 39:08.238
AND I BROUGHT LITTLE
SIDE DISHES FOR EVERYBODY.

39:08.271 --> 39:09.272
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.153
THIS IS A SIGNATURE DISH.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.055
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
REALLY BLACK IN THE MIDDLE.

39:33.096 --> 39:36.966
THEY SEEM VERY HAPPY.
THEY HAVE SMILES.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.401
CRITICS TABLE,

39:38.434 --> 39:39.836
SHE THOUGHT THE SHEPHERD'S PIE
WAS DELICIOUS.

39:39.869 --> 39:41.304
BEAUTIFUL.

39:41.337 --> 39:44.240
NOW, THIS IS WHERE THIS PUB
STARTS TO MAKE MONEY.

39:44.274 --> 39:45.842
IT'S TURNING TABLES
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

39:45.875 --> 39:47.110
THE ATMOSPHERE IS ELECTRIC.

39:47.143 --> 39:48.511
NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU GOT IN THE HAMPTONS,

39:48.545 --> 39:50.813
YOU CAN'T BUY
AN ATMOSPHERE LIKE THIS.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.248
EXTRAORDINARY.

39:52.282 --> 39:54.984
WE CAN PUT
THESE TWO SOUPS OUT HERE.

39:55.018 --> 39:56.152
WE'RE ON IT.
COME ON THEN.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.112
BUDDY.

39:57.112 --> 39:57.220
BUDDY.

39:57.253 --> 39:59.088

39:59.122 --> 40:00.623
I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA
PACK THE PLACE, YES?
YES, SIR.

40:00.657 --> 40:02.258
GIVE IT 24 HOURS,
LET THE WORD SPREAD,

40:02.292 --> 40:04.427
AND EVERY

40:04.460 --> 40:05.495
DO ME A FAVOR.
YES?

40:05.528 --> 40:07.730
STAY FOR A WHILE.

40:07.764 --> 40:10.166
THE DINNER SERVICE
ENDS SUCCESSFULLY.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.201
CUSTOMERS ARE LEAVING
SATISFIED.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.737
AND THE FAMILY PROVED
THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT WORK.

40:14.771 --> 40:16.239
THANK YOU.
BYE-BYE.

40:16.272 --> 40:19.642
AT LEAST FOR ONE NIGHT.

40:22.679 --> 40:24.547
*

40:24.581 --> 40:27.112
14 YEARS OF
WORKING IN SOME PLACES

40:27.112 --> 40:28.351
14 YEARS OF
WORKING IN SOME PLACES

40:28.384 --> 40:29.719
AND CRAPPY PLACES

40:29.752 --> 40:32.155
AND TRYING TO GET
EVERYTHING I CAN,

40:32.188 --> 40:34.390
TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT
SHOW YOU--

40:34.424 --> 40:35.992
AWESOME.

40:36.025 --> 40:40.129
IT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO
FOR A LONG TIME,

40:40.163 --> 40:41.898
AND I JUST FADED AWAY,
YOU KNOW.

40:41.931 --> 40:43.666
JUST CAME IN
AND WENT THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.369
YOU KNOW, FOR HIM COMING,

40:46.402 --> 40:48.171
YOU KNOW, AND TELLING ME

40:48.204 --> 40:50.506

40:50.540 --> 40:52.508
HE ACTUALLY DID,
HE, YOU KNOW,

40:52.542 --> 40:56.312
MADE ME FEEL
LIKE I WANTED TO COOK AGAIN.

41:00.283 --> 41:01.451
NO, NO, NO, NO, GUYS.

41:01.484 --> 41:03.019
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I SAW.

41:03.052 --> 41:04.654
AND THIS IS
THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH.

41:04.687 --> 41:07.223
I SAW A FAMILY COME TOGETHER.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.325
THERE WAS A BUZZ.
EVERYBODY FELT IT.

41:09.359 --> 41:11.260
YOU KNOW, AND WE WERE
A FAMILY AGAIN.

41:11.294 --> 41:13.496
THE FIRST AND FOREMOST
IMPORTANT THING

41:13.529 --> 41:15.064
TO THINK ABOUT TOMORROW--

41:15.098 --> 41:16.866
DO NOT STOP SUPPORTING
EACH OTHER,

41:16.899 --> 41:18.735
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT FAMILY.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.471
AND WHEN IT WORKS,
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

41:21.504 --> 41:23.640
GOOD NIGHT.
CHEF.

41:23.673 --> 41:25.908
GORDON RAMSAY
REFERS TO ME AS A CHEF,

41:25.942 --> 41:27.112
IT BLOWS MY MIND.

41:27.112 --> 41:27.210
IT BLOWS MY MIND.

41:27.243 --> 41:28.745
DON'T YOU STOP,
BIG BOY, YES?

41:28.778 --> 41:30.847
- THANK YOU.
- COCKY.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.515
HE'S PUT US
TO THE TEST.

41:32.548 --> 41:35.385
IT WAS VERY REWARDING
TO HEAR CHEF TELL US

41:35.418 --> 41:36.819
WHAT A GOOD JOB WE DID.

41:36.853 --> 41:38.621
SMILE, YES?

41:38.655 --> 41:40.723
YES?
YES.

41:40.757 --> 41:42.125
DETECTIVE MY ASS.

41:42.158 --> 41:44.394
ARE YOU SURE?
HUH?

41:44.427 --> 41:46.462
WE APPRECIATE WHAT HE DID.

41:46.496 --> 41:49.065
ALL THE WORK THAT HE DID
DIDN'T FALL ON DEAF EARS.

41:49.098 --> 41:51.267
I SAW A FAMILY
COME TOGETHER.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.169
I WAS PROUD.

41:53.202 --> 41:54.837
REALLY PROUD.

41:54.871 --> 41:57.073
YOU'RE A GREAT DAD,
AND YOU GOT A HEART OF GOLD

41:57.106 --> 41:57.112
AND TWO GREAT SONS.

41:57.112 --> 41:58.307
AND TWO GREAT SONS.

41:58.341 --> 41:59.709
CHEERS.
TAKE CARE.

41:59.742 --> 42:00.743
THANK YOU.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.351
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES DOING THESE

42:08.384 --> 42:09.886
CAN BE A RIGHT
PAIN IN THE ASS.

42:09.919 --> 42:11.721
I HAVE TO SAY,
THIS ONE WAS A JOY,

42:11.754 --> 42:14.257
BECAUSE THIS FAMILY NOW
ARE UNITED

42:14.290 --> 42:17.560
AND THEY DESERVE
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.803
TWO MONTHS LATER
AND FINN McCOOL'S

42:26.836 --> 42:27.112
IS ON IT'S WAY
TO ESTABLISHING ITSELF

42:27.112 --> 42:29.272
IS ON IT'S WAY
TO ESTABLISHING ITSELF

42:29.305 --> 42:30.873
AS A FUN, HAPPENING,
FAMILY RESTAURANT.

42:30.907 --> 42:32.675
THE CLAMS ARE JUST DELICIOUS.

42:32.709 --> 42:33.676
REALLY GOOD.

42:33.710 --> 42:35.378
WELCOME TO FINN McCOOL'S.

42:35.411 --> 42:37.013
THIS IS THE GREATEST THING
IN THE WORLD.

42:37.046 --> 42:38.014
THE GREATEST THING HAS HAPPENED.

42:38.047 --> 42:38.981
THE SHEPHERD'S PIE

42:39.015 --> 42:40.349
IS THE TALK OF THE TOWN.

42:40.383 --> 42:42.218
AND THE PRIDE
OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

42:42.251 --> 42:44.954
BRIAN AND JASON HAVE BECOME
QUITE THE TEAM,

42:44.987 --> 42:48.124
BOTH STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE
AND SUPPORTING EACH OTHER.

42:48.157 --> 42:49.225
YOU GOT IT?
YEAH.

42:49.258 --> 42:50.693
YOU SURE?
BEAT IT.

42:50.727 --> 42:52.628
I LOVE MY BROTHER TO DEATH.
UH, NO QUESTION.

42:52.662 --> 42:54.263
AS FOR BUDDY,

42:54.297 --> 42:57.112
HE FINALLY CASHED
HIS FIRST PAYCHECK.

42:57.112 --> 42:57.667
HE FINALLY CASHED
HIS FIRST PAYCHECK.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.703
AND AT LAST,
IRISH EYES ARE SMILING.

43:00.737 --> 43:02.939
I HAVE TWO SONS
THAT ARE PHENOMENAL.

43:02.972 --> 43:04.474
I HAVE A GREAT STAFF.

43:04.507 --> 43:06.169
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

43:06.169 --> 43:07.513
THIS IS WHAT WE PLANNED FOR.

43:07.513 --> 43:08.676
I LOVE IT.
