00:00.001 --> 00:03.135
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, where were we? Ah, yes.</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:05.137
<i>Our heroine, jane villanueva,</i>
<i>was accidentally</i>

00:05.139 --> 00:06.505
<i>Inseminated with</i>
<i>rafael solano's sperm.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.741
<i>Oh, and the doctor</i>
<i>who inseminated her,</i>

00:08.743 --> 00:10.476
<i>Well, it was rafael's sister,</i>
<i>luisa.</i>

00:10.478 --> 00:13.245
Hi.
<i>And honestly,</i>
<i>things were a little rocky</i>

00:13.247 --> 00:15.314
<i>For luisa since then.</i>
<i>For one, she started sleeping</i>

00:15.316 --> 00:18.050
<i>With her father's wife.</i>
<i>(whistling)</i>

00:18.052 --> 00:20.352
<i>And when she threatened</i>
<i>to tell, well, this happened.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:22.755
You're having
some sort of episode.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.623
Fantasizing.
Stop lying.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.692
I have no choice.
I have to commit her.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.694
<i>But the solano family</i>
<i>had bigger problems.</i>

00:28.696 --> 00:31.263
See, jane's ex-fiancÃ©, michael,
<i>is a detective,</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:33.699
<i>And he found secret tunnels</i>
<i>underneath the marbella,</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:36.368
<i>And the tunnels are connected</i>
<i>to sin rostro.</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:38.203
<i>No one knows who he is,</i>
<i>but they know he's really bad.</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:39.638
<i>And he was working there</i>
<i>with a plastic surgeon.</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:41.340
They're performing
plastic surgery

00:41.342 --> 00:42.708
On criminals in this room.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.810
<i>And even worse,</i>
<i>rose was starting to suspect</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:46.545
<i>Sin rostro might be emilio.</i>

00:46.547 --> 00:48.213
I am scared, rafael.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.382
<i>And michael followed rafael to</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:51.617
<i>His meeting</i>
<i>with the hotel subcontractor.</i>

00:51.619 --> 00:53.285
<i>Straight out of a telenovela,</i>
<i>right?</i>

00:53.287 --> 00:55.054
<i>And speaking of telenovelas,</i>

00:55.056 --> 00:56.488
<i>Jane's dad is a big star,</i>

00:56.490 --> 00:58.791
<i>And he got jane a job</i>
<i>working there.</i>

00:58.793 --> 01:02.261
Jane is the new writer's intern
for    <i>the passions of santo</i>yes!

01:02.263 --> 01:04.363
<i>But, of course, the telenovela</i>
<i>had drama of its own.</i>

01:04.365 --> 01:06.799
Rogelio won't know
what hit him.

01:06.801 --> 01:11.503
<i>So, let's see</i>
<i>how that plays out, shall we?</i>

01:11.505 --> 01:14.573
<i>Jane villanueva was</i>
<i>a good girl.</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:17.309
<i>A</i> very <i>good girl.</i>

01:17.311 --> 01:19.344
<i>But when jane was</i>
<i>ten years old,</i>

01:19.346 --> 01:22.381
<i>She did something</i>
<i>very, very bad.</i>

01:22.383 --> 01:25.317
<i>She borrowed her</i> abuela's
<i>favorite earrings</i>

01:25.319 --> 01:28.554
<i>When she was specifically</i>
<i>told not to.</i>

01:28.556 --> 01:31.824
<i>And she lost them.</i>

01:34.127 --> 01:37.463
<i>After a vigorous search</i>
<i>revealed nothing,</i>

01:37.465 --> 01:40.332
<i>And a hastily-considered</i>
<i>escape plan failed...</i>

01:40.334 --> 01:42.501
Jane?

01:42.503 --> 01:44.670
<i>...Young jane finally</i>
<i>came clean to her grandmother</i>

01:44.672 --> 01:46.839
<i>And told her what happened.</i>

01:46.841 --> 01:48.707
I lost them.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.378
(crying):
I'm so sorry, abuela.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.347
I know what I did

01:55.349 --> 01:56.415
Is unforgivable.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.883
Shh.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.797
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It was a lesson</i>
<i>jane never forgot.</i>

02:13.700 --> 02:15.534
Of course I'm not
gonna forgive her.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.503
But she's your sister.
Yeah, exactly.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.838
And there's history here
of lying, of using people,

02:19.840 --> 02:21.406
Of making selfish decisions.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.509
Look, I am glad
that she is doing well,

02:23.511 --> 02:25.777
But we do not need
to sit in therapy with her.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.778
We?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.614
Hmm?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.315
You just said "we."

02:30.317 --> 02:31.583
Did she want me there?

02:33.486 --> 02:34.887
Why didn't you tell me this?

02:34.889 --> 02:36.421
Because I thought
you might say yes.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.489
Not cool!

02:37.491 --> 02:38.891
I'm sorry. I was... I was wrong.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.926
No, you were right. We're going.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.529
(groans)
she's the baby's
aunt, family now.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.732
She deserves a chance
to explain.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.302
But I can go alone
if you don't want to go.
No, no, no.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.471
You are not going alone.
I will go.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.574
Well played.

02:55.576 --> 02:56.608
(ringtone playing)

02:56.610 --> 02:59.278
Sorry. Got to work.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.879
Hello. Martin. What's up?

03:00.881 --> 03:02.714
Petra. You got
to be kidding me.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.617
What the hell is wrong with her?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.352
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Well, there's a lot wrong</i>
<i>with petra,</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:08.854
<i>If you want to know the truth.</i>

03:08.856 --> 03:11.623
<i>You'll recall</i>
<i>she was currently hiding out</i>

03:11.625 --> 03:14.526
<i>In a high-security suite</i>
<i>because she was sure milos,</i>

03:14.528 --> 03:18.430
<i>Her crazy acid-throwing</i>
<i>ex-boyfriend, had found her.</i>

03:18.432 --> 03:19.731
Did you hear that?

03:19.733 --> 03:21.567
I tooted.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.535
Let's not draw attention to it.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.804
I'm gonna call lachlan,
see if he landed in Spain.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.540
I don't trust lachlan.
Well, I do, mother.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.575
(knocking)

03:39.919 --> 03:41.653
(sighs)

03:41.655 --> 03:44.523
What do you want?
I want you to
do your job.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.658
And right now, your job
is event coordinator.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.360
And I know that
because I have

03:48.362 --> 03:49.595
Your paycheck
sitting on my desk.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.530
Yet, for some reason,
I was just informed

03:51.532 --> 03:52.998
That you are refusing
to take meetings.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.833
I'm a little
under the weather.
I don't care.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.935
The hotel needs to be
booking events right now,

03:56.937 --> 03:58.837
And you apparently
have an appointment.

03:58.839 --> 04:02.541
So if you don't show up,
I don't sign your paycheck.

04:04.510 --> 04:07.546
I'll be at my appointment.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.814
Hmm.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.484
Okay, here we go.
Hey.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.019
Target run complete.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.488
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, jane's glamorous job.</i>

04:16.490 --> 04:18.323
And now for lunch.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.925
<i>As an intern at</i>
<i>the passions of santos.</i>

04:19.927 --> 04:21.026
Steven:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.494
There are onions.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.996
I specifically asked
for no onions.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.331
I can scrape them off.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.567
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yup. She's living the dream.</i>

04:28.569 --> 04:30.702
Jane, good. You're here.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.771
I wanted to talk to you,
actually.

04:35.541 --> 04:37.376
Did your salad come
with croutons again?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.777
Let's hope not.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.480
Sit, please.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.015
I have some great news for you.

04:43.017 --> 04:45.584
Do you like great news?
Sure.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.953
We'd like you
to write the next episode

04:47.955 --> 04:49.988
Of <i>the passions of santos.</i>

04:49.990 --> 04:51.857
Me? Why?
Mm-hmm.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.559
Because that scene you wrote
showed a lot of promise,

04:54.561 --> 04:57.396
And we're always looking
to develop new talent.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.697
Plus, we're required
by the guild

04:58.699 --> 05:00.966
To give some scripts
to outside writers.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.436
So... Are you in?

05:04.438 --> 05:07.572
Or would you rather scrape
onions off steven's chili?

05:07.574 --> 05:09.641
I would rather write the script.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.625
Oh. Hi, jane.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.427
I was just running
lines with nicholas.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.895
He's a very talented
scene actor, as well.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.563
Thanks, rogelio.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.433
Were you looking for me?

05:34.435 --> 05:37.502
Yes. I was wondering...

05:37.504 --> 05:39.671
Did you make the writers
give me a script?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.373
You got a script?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.442
Come on, rogelio. Stop acting.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.743
I swear I'm not acting.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.612
When I act, I suck in my gut
and I stick out my chin.

05:47.614 --> 05:48.814
You know, like this.
This is just me.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.482
You really got a script?

05:50.484 --> 05:51.616
You really didn't know?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.585
I had nothing to do with it.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.657
That means I got it
because they think I'm good.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.592
I can't... I can't believe it!

06:00.594 --> 06:02.828
Me, neither!
I mean, I made a vision board,

06:02.830 --> 06:05.063
But I wouldn't think
it would manifest so quickly.

06:05.065 --> 06:08.767
As father and daughter, we will
<i>conquer hollywood together,</i>

06:08.769 --> 06:10.869
<i>Much like jon voight</i>
<i>and angelina jolie.</i>

06:10.871 --> 06:13.939
Only we will not be estranged.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.575
And I will be
the much more famous one.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.845
I'm so proud of you, jane.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.913
(sighs)

06:21.915 --> 06:24.816
Michael:
Nadine?

06:25.918 --> 06:28.019
You went to the
chief behind my back.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.621
You got me suspended.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.124
And you followed rafael
when you were told not to.

06:32.126 --> 06:34.860
Because I knew he was hiding
something, and I was right.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.762
He went to see
a subcontractor--

06:36.764 --> 06:38.730
The one who probably built
the tunnels under the marbella--

06:38.732 --> 06:40.432
And the subcontractor
called the plastic surgeon

06:40.434 --> 06:41.900
Right after rafael left.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.035
We know a plastic surgeon
is working for sin rostro,

06:44.037 --> 06:45.871
Likely changing the faces
of criminals.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.606
And we're looking into the lead.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.040
You need to arrest
rafael solano.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.610
For what?
Talking to a contractor?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.745
Besides, if he is involved,
he's working for his father.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.714
He's the big fish here.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.650
And maybe if you weren't
taking this personally...
What?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.619
I'm not.
You are, and I'm not
risking my career

07:00.621 --> 07:01.987
Because of your jane obsession.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.889
What are you talking about?
I saw you, michael,

07:03.891 --> 07:06.124
There with her in the hospital.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.693
I love you, jane.
I love you now,

07:08.695 --> 07:10.896
And I'll love you forever.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.664
Oh.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.699
I get it.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.668
What?
You're jealous of jane.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.804
That's ridiculous.
No, it's not.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.705
And I'm the one
making it personal?

07:20.707 --> 07:23.141
Sin rostro's got to be
emilio solano.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.744
That's who
we're focused on.
Okay.

07:25.746 --> 07:29.714
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And it was not just nadine</i>
<i>who suspected emilio.</i>

07:29.716 --> 07:32.150
<i>His wife, you'll remember,</i>
<i>also suspected the worst.</i>

07:32.152 --> 07:33.985
Emilio:
Rose?
(gasps)

07:33.987 --> 07:37.022
I imagined
you'd be glad to see me.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.690
(chuckles)

07:38.692 --> 07:40.725
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yikes. She seems scared stiff.</i>

07:40.727 --> 07:42.461
I am glad.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.730
You just, uh, weren't due back
for two days.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.866
I thought I would surprise you.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.234
Well, you succeeded.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.770
I have some good news.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.739
We are going out of town,
just the two of us.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.175
Oh.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.611
It's just, now is not
a great time...

07:59.613 --> 08:01.780
It's a perfect time.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.483
Just what we need.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.784
Pack for a long trip.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.886
Scott's made
all the arrangements.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.655
Just got your passport renewed,
mrs. Solano, and I'm
(rose gasps)

08:10.657 --> 08:12.791
Packing for mr. Solano if you
want me to pack for you, too.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.693
Where are we going?

08:14.695 --> 08:18.864
Now, why would I want
to ruin the surprise?

08:20.867 --> 08:23.835
I just can't believe jane
gets to write a telenovela.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.871
I'm so freakin'
proud of her.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.273
She's a wonderful girl.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.042
It's clear
she gets her charms from you.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.012
Well, she's got
your beautiful eyes.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.548
She's got your full lips.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.683
Your perfect skin.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.186
Your incredible legs.
(sighs)

08:41.188 --> 08:44.222
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, I don't think they're</i>
<i>talking about jane anymore.</i>

08:44.224 --> 08:47.225
Yeah, we really made
a great one.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.829
We could probably make
more great ones.
Hmm.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.298
<i>But alas, xo has made a vow</i>

08:53.300 --> 08:55.300
<i>Not to have sex</i>
<i>for the time being.</i>

08:55.302 --> 08:58.970
And I won't let a man between
these legs again without a ring.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.840
<i>And they are both doing</i>
<i>their best to respect it.</i>

09:01.842 --> 09:03.308
So do you want
to have sex?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.577
<i>Still, no harm in asking.</i>

09:05.579 --> 09:06.645
No.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.913
Me, neither.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.649
I was just testing you.
(chuckles)
mm.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.318
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which brings us here, now,</i>

09:13.320 --> 09:15.287
<i>To jane arriving</i>
<i>at the telenovela</i>

09:15.289 --> 09:17.789
<i>For her first day</i>
<i>as an official writer.</i>

09:17.791 --> 09:19.291
<i>I'm not going to lie.</i>

09:19.293 --> 09:21.860
<i>It was frickin' thrilling!</i>

09:21.862 --> 09:23.962
Nicholas:
Jane.
Good morning, nicholas.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.932
Dina wanted me to give you the
story document for your episode.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.900
Thank you! How exciting!

09:28.902 --> 09:30.969
Yeah, you shouldn't
get too excited.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.872
Read the last paragraph.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.214
Wait. What?!

09:47.153 --> 09:49.888
Okay. Well, maybe
he doesn't die.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.367
I don't understand.
They're killing off santos?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.735
Yeah, I can't believe it either.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.936
But he's the star of the show.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.938
He has been
really difficult lately.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.841
He's refusing to come out
of his dressing room,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.810
And he knows
we're waiting for him!

10:11.812 --> 10:14.145
He rewrote
every one of his lines.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.213
Who does he think he is?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.282
I am the star of this show!

10:17.284 --> 10:18.883
I was just voted <i>people en</i>
<i>espaÃ±ol's</i> sexiest man alive!

10:18.885 --> 10:20.852
Now give me
that cruller!

10:20.854 --> 10:22.954
Apparently,
the network's over it.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.290
First, he demanded
they relocate the show to miami.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.325
Now he's costing them
tons in overtime.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.695
And...

10:30.697 --> 10:33.331
That's why they had me
write the episode,

10:33.333 --> 10:35.767
So that it can soften the blow.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.205
(exhales)
does rogelio know?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.874
Rogelio:
No...!

10:42.876 --> 10:44.242
I think they just told him.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.677
Hmm.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.012
Rafael:
<i>Calm down.</i>

10:47.014 --> 10:49.681
Just calm down.

10:49.683 --> 10:53.084
How can I calm down? Emilio
wants me to go away with him.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.153
You don't have to go.
Of course I'm not going to,

10:55.155 --> 10:59.090
But I... I feel like
we have to do something.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.326
I mean, what if he's sin rostro?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.961
I have been through
all of my father's books,

11:02.963 --> 11:04.963
I've talked to
all of his accountants,

11:04.965 --> 11:07.766
And there is absolutely nothing
tying my dad to those tunnels.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.968
Then let's go to the police,
tell them that.

11:09.970 --> 11:13.905
Do that, you raise suspicions,
you'll ruin him.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.941
Rumors fly, investors pull
out, you destroy everything,

11:16.943 --> 11:19.110
A business that he's spent
a lifetime building.

11:19.112 --> 11:23.081
Rose, if you care
for my father at all,

11:23.083 --> 11:26.351
Please don't go to the police.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.787
I know him, and he
has a lot of flaws,

11:28.789 --> 11:31.089
But he is not
a murderer.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.091
Rogelio:
<i>This is outrageous.</i>

11:33.093 --> 11:36.194
It's crazy.
They can't do this to me.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.830
Okay, well,
thank you.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.832
Your agent? What'd he say?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.267
They're doing this to me.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.968
Rogelio, I'm so sorry.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.905
But I don't understand.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.039
You know?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.041
I love this role.
I love playing santos.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.044
I identify so deeply
with <i>el presidente.</i>

11:53.046 --> 11:55.280
Tell them that.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.882
Look, there are some real issues
that need to be worked out.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.884
But maybe go to dina
to plead your case,

11:59.886 --> 12:02.420
Kind of seem humble,
and maybe they'll reconsider.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.422
Humble.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.057
Oh.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.459
Well, yes. Excellent, jane.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.894
I mean, that
will be easy.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.262
Considering my immense gifts,

12:11.264 --> 12:13.998
I'm one of the most humble men
in the world.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.101
(clears throat)

12:17.303 --> 12:19.304
Dina, ricky, steven,

12:19.306 --> 12:21.072
Writers I don't know,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.307
Good to see you.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.975
Rogelio, how are you?

12:23.977 --> 12:26.111
How am I?
(squeaks softly)

12:26.113 --> 12:28.279
I am well,
all things considered.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.918
Oh, yes. This is for you.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.821
They are mini muffins from
a very famous miami bakery.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.057
They're mini, so you can eat
as many as you like

12:39.059 --> 12:41.159
Without gaining your fat back.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.461
Dina:
Thank you, rogelio.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.263
Was there
something else?

12:45.265 --> 12:48.266
Mm. Yes, actually.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.102
I wanted to see
if I could convince you,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.505
Uh, not to kill me off.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.109
Look, it wasn't
an easy decision.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.478
I have carried this show
on my back for months.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.847
I am the only reason it became
an international sensation

13:02.849 --> 13:04.182
Loved by millions...

13:04.184 --> 13:08.052
Uh, I think
that what rogelio is saying

13:08.054 --> 13:10.088
Is that he is grateful
for this role

13:10.090 --> 13:12.223
And he cherishes

13:12.225 --> 13:14.893
The success that
you've experienced together.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.094
Did I not say exactly that?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.862
It's okay. Just keep going.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.431
Anyway, I think
you should think twice

13:20.433 --> 13:24.469
About what you're doing, because
my shoes are impossible to fill.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.873
Again, what rogelio means

13:28.875 --> 13:32.811
Is that he would love...

13:32.813 --> 13:35.380
The opportunity to continue
to explore

13:35.382 --> 13:38.550
This amazing character
that you've created.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.951
Yes, precisely.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.020
(sighs)

13:43.956 --> 13:46.224
I'm sorry, rogelio.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.293
The decision has been made.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.062
You're sorry?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.231
You know what,

13:53.233 --> 13:54.532
You    <i>wi</i>be sorry...

13:54.534 --> 13:55.533
Rogelio...
No, jane.
They don't care.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.001
They don't listen.

13:57.003 --> 13:57.936
You can't have

13:57.938 --> 13:59.137
<i>The passions of santos</i>

13:59.139 --> 14:01.306
Without santos!

14:01.308 --> 14:05.076
Then it's just <i>passions,</i>
<i>and that show failed!</i>

14:17.256 --> 14:20.258
Are you okay?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.861
I'm sorry. I just...

14:22.863 --> 14:24.495
I know.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.932
And I'm obviously
not writing that script.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.636
Thank you so much. Bye.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.638
I'm here for my meeting.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.075
I'm still feeling
under the weather, but I'm here.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.576
You are so brave.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.245
He's here.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.913
This guy's got
big money, apparently.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.315
He wants to book a wedding,
so try to close this deal.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.550
I'll do my best.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.185
Uh, petra,

14:47.187 --> 14:48.920
This is mr. Dvoracek.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.957
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Hey, isn't that...</i>

15:02.601 --> 15:04.235
Uh, excuse me.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.173
It's petra.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.310
I had to see you.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.580
Please, sit.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.283
And then I will leave here
if you still want me to.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.919
I promise.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.299
(chuckles softly)

15:34.301 --> 15:36.701
I understand you
are upset with me.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.703
You threw acid at me.
At your mother.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.705
It hit my mother.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.608
Only because I bent over
to pick up a koruna.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.343
There was no "only" about it.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.211
I threw that koruna.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.314
What?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.381
Your mother always went

15:50.383 --> 15:51.449
<i>To the market alone.</i>

15:51.451 --> 15:53.051
<i>But for some reason,</i>

15:53.053 --> 15:55.253
<i>On that night</i>
<i>you were with her.</i>

15:55.255 --> 15:57.021
(chuckles)
I had to think quickly.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.323
As you were in the
habit of stopping

15:58.325 --> 16:00.325
To pick up coins on the street,

16:00.327 --> 16:03.628
<i>I thought it just might work.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:05.263
I loved that about you,

16:05.265 --> 16:08.599
How you used to stop
to pick up coins off the street.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.435
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

16:10.437 --> 16:13.271
That you meant
to throw acid at my mother?

16:13.273 --> 16:16.341
Yes. A little.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.710
I would never have thrown it
at you.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.579
You never should have thrown it.
Period.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.215
That is true, too, yes.
I know that now.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.617
Natal...

16:26.619 --> 16:28.319
Petra, I mean.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.423
That moment,
it was a very low point for me.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.025
For my mother, too.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.293
Listen,

16:35.295 --> 16:36.728
Instead of jail,

16:36.730 --> 16:39.197
They sent me
to a rehabilitation program.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.566
I don't know how to
say in english...

16:41.568 --> 16:43.735
So I'm here to apologize.

16:43.737 --> 16:47.372
I'm sorry I threw
acid at your mother.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.208
But she lied to
keep us apart!

16:50.210 --> 16:52.410
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Looks like someone could use</i>
<i>a little more time</i>

16:52.412 --> 16:53.644
<i>In anger management.</i>

16:53.646 --> 16:56.180
Can you forgive me?

16:59.151 --> 17:01.386
(crying)

17:12.331 --> 17:14.332
Are you okay?

17:15.300 --> 17:17.402
I'm fine.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.140
It's just...
You don't look fine.

17:22.142 --> 17:26.244
You don't have to be here, jane.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.246
I'm not such a monster
that I expect you

17:28.248 --> 17:30.681
To be my shoulder
to cry on.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.486
(crying)

17:39.425 --> 17:42.326
(sighs)

17:42.328 --> 17:44.595
What is it, huh?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.602
I had this abusive
ex-boyfriend, and now...

17:51.604 --> 17:55.239
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so petra told jane</i>
<i>all about milos.</i>

17:55.241 --> 17:58.242
<i>The acid. The koruna.</i>
<i>Magda's accident.</i>

17:58.244 --> 18:00.311
<i>The reason she...</i>

18:00.313 --> 18:02.814
<i>Well, you know the details.</i>

18:02.816 --> 18:06.617
<i>The point is: Jane was moved.</i>

18:06.619 --> 18:09.120
I had no idea.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.857
You're bleeding.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.859
Oh, no. It-it's
fake blood.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.360
I work at a telenovela.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.496
Occupational hazard.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.498
(chuckles)

18:20.500 --> 18:22.166
Jane:
<i>You should have seen her.</i>

18:22.168 --> 18:23.568
She was so scared.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.403
Do I have to remind you
what she's done?

18:25.405 --> 18:27.371
No. You have to keep
your eyes on the road.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.374
(chuckles)
will you just please keep
your distance from petra?

18:30.376 --> 18:32.376
She is... Crazy.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.644
Maybe focus on
the crazy lady

18:33.646 --> 18:36.214
We're about to go
sit in therapy with.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.583
Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes. They were on their way
<i>to visit his sister.</i>

18:38.585 --> 18:41.119
Come on. Don't go into this
expecting the worst.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.221
I'm not. I'm expecting
what's gonna happen.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.856
I've been here before with my
sister. Every time's the same.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.758
She's gonna start
first by apologizing.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.662
I'm so, so sorry for what I did.

18:51.664 --> 18:55.600
For my mistake, for not
telling you when I made it.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.468
And then she's
gonna start talking

18:57.470 --> 18:59.704
About how alcoholism
is a disease.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.873
And it's one
that I struggle with every day.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.508
I'm aware of that.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.909
Don't get me wrong.
It's a good story.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.611
By the way,
she's very convincing.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.480
And I know now that I have to...

19:09.482 --> 19:12.550
Constantly be aware of it.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.186
And I'm committed to that.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.921
Just don't fall for it, jane.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.356
Wow.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.525
Well...

19:20.527 --> 19:23.461
Thanks for saying
all that, luisa.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.464
And luisa has something more
she wants to say.

19:26.466 --> 19:30.401
Latin lover narrator: <i>Uh-oh.</i>
<i>A turn he didn't see coming.</i>

19:30.403 --> 19:31.636
I'm hurt.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.237
You knew

19:33.239 --> 19:34.405
What it would feel like

19:34.407 --> 19:36.240
For me to be institutionalized.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.209
Like her.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.845
Sorry. "her"? Who?

19:40.847 --> 19:45.349
My mother had a psychotic break
and killed herself.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.786
And that's why I
put you in here.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.855
I didn't want anything
to happen to you.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.891
And you were delusional
and you were talking about rose

19:53.893 --> 19:58.196
And how you two were... Lovers.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.798
Yeah, well...
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that they were lovers.</i>

20:02.501 --> 20:04.902
<i>A fact</i>
<i>luisa had never wavered on.</i>

20:04.904 --> 20:07.572
Obviously I was delusional
about that.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.873
<i>It should also be noted</i>
<i>that luisa</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:10.341
<i>Would say absolutely anything</i>

20:10.343 --> 20:11.709
<i>To get out of the asylum.</i>

20:11.711 --> 20:13.978
But you knew
how scared I'd be to be in here.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.546
I'm sorry.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.248
I've...

20:17.250 --> 20:19.650
Just had a lot on my mind.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.219
And what is that?

20:21.221 --> 20:23.721
Excuse me?

20:23.723 --> 20:26.557
If you tell your sister
what you've had on your mind,

20:26.559 --> 20:27.825
It might help her

20:27.827 --> 20:29.760
Move past her hurt.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.232
Okay, fine.
You want to know,

20:34.234 --> 20:36.567
Luisa, what's been
on my mind?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.703
The marbella is
swarming with cops,

20:38.705 --> 20:41.706
Because sin rostro,
a big drug dealer,

20:41.708 --> 20:43.908
Seems to be tied
to my hotel.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.244
And just outside
of our dad's suite,

20:46.246 --> 20:49.013
I found a dead bellboy
with a corkscrew in his neck.

20:50.482 --> 20:51.649
A corkscrew?

20:51.651 --> 20:53.584
And the cops seem to think

20:53.586 --> 20:56.654
That dad is somehow involved.

20:56.656 --> 21:01.592
<i>Call me crazy, but I think</i>
<i>luisa knows something big.</i>

21:01.594 --> 21:03.828
(speaking spanish)

21:22.681 --> 21:24.415
Xiomara:
Are you okay?

21:24.417 --> 21:27.418
If I was sexy enough,
they wouldn't have fired me.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.420
Oh, stop.
That's ridiculous.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.422
You're as sexy as
you've ever been.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.723
Aging agrees with you.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.892
That is not true.
At my peak,

21:34.894 --> 21:38.562
You would have never been able
to resist having sex with me.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.564
Just look.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.800
So effortlessly sexy.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.670
I didn't wash my hair that day;
not a drop of makeup.

21:46.738 --> 21:49.674
Maybe a little eyeliner,
but that's it.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.809
Okay, that's enough.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.711
Stop looking back.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.713
You have to look forward.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.915
This firing could be
a blessing in disguise.

21:57.917 --> 22:01.018
This could be the start of
a second career for you...

22:01.020 --> 22:03.454
As a movie star.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.590
George clooney didn't become a
movie star until later in life.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.926
I have always wanted
to do movies.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.528
Well, now's your chance.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.662
Tv's too small.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.565
Your face needs
to be 50 feet high.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.600
And in 3-d.
I have been told

22:16.602 --> 22:18.002
I have the perfect features
for 3-d.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.337
Of course you do.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.472
Yes.
So get after that.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.774
And believe me...

22:23.776 --> 22:26.610
I hate this stupid
chastity thing.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.846
And it is so hard
for me every day

22:28.848 --> 22:30.715
(whispers):
Not to pounce on you.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.953
(gasps)
oh, god!

22:35.955 --> 22:38.956
(panting) sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.025
It's okay. Whew.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.663
I wanted to ask you
for a favor.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.865
And I know...

22:47.867 --> 22:50.034
I know you have no reason

22:50.036 --> 22:52.970
To do me any favor, but...

22:52.972 --> 22:55.706
I wanted you to give this
to rose.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.410
It's an apology. I'm...
I'm trying to make amends.

22:59.412 --> 23:02.680
It's so important
for my recovery.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.850
Please?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.785
Give it to her?

23:09.788 --> 23:13.057
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane knew rafael</i>
<i>would not approve.</i>

23:13.059 --> 23:17.027
<i>She knew that he thought</i>
<i>she was way too trusting.</i>

23:17.029 --> 23:20.431
<i>And she also knew</i>
<i>she'd be taking the letter.</i>

23:20.433 --> 23:21.932
Lachlan, it's me.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.101
I need to sneak out of here
without milos finding out.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.971
Call me tonight after midnight.
And if you don't hear from me...

23:26.973 --> 23:28.806
Never mind, you will.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.808
(gasps, screams)

23:35.447 --> 23:36.981
Okay. Visit an asylum.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.450
Check that one
off my bucket list.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.684
I need a drink.

23:40.686 --> 23:42.119
You want anything?
No.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.522
I'm good. I'm gonna go
change for my shift.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.690
(ringtone playing)
uh, your purse
is ringing.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.025
Oh, could you check

23:48.027 --> 23:49.727
Who that is, please?

23:49.729 --> 23:50.995
(groans)

23:50.997 --> 23:53.063
Hey.

23:55.634 --> 23:57.468
What's this?

23:57.470 --> 23:58.869
Your sister gave
that to me.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.137
She wanted to
apologize to rose.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.872
I was gonna
give it to you.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.707
Great. I have it.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.543
Are you gonna give it to rose?

24:08.046 --> 24:09.914
Course not.
(sighs)

24:09.916 --> 24:12.983
You know,
she just wants to apologize.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.452
What? What is it?

24:14.454 --> 24:16.587
I just think you're being
too trusting, jane.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.655
It's just a letter.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.889
It's never just anything

24:18.891 --> 24:20.124
With her, okay?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.926
Luisa's motives
are usually selfish.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.028
Or maybe you're being
a little hard on her.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.897
I mean, she did seem really
hurt that you didn't visit.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.800
Come on. You, too?
What?

24:29.802 --> 24:32.736
Look, I get... That she's hurt.

24:32.738 --> 24:35.105
I'm hurt, too.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.841
I put up my hotel as collateral

24:36.843 --> 24:38.075
For her medical
malpractice insurance.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.977
I believed in her.
I was the only one.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.613
And I get that you're the kind
of person who's, like,

24:42.615 --> 24:44.982
Full of forgiveness...
Hmm.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.951
But... (sighs)

24:46.953 --> 24:48.853
There's history here.

24:48.855 --> 24:52.089
And for me...

24:52.091 --> 24:54.158
There's just a lot to forgive.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.928
Yeah.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.064
Hey... I get it.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.166
You're right.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.637
Let me go change
for my shift.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.045
Hey.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.047
How are you feeling?

25:17.049 --> 25:18.148
Much better.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.984
I have had time
to process things,

25:19.986 --> 25:22.253
And I realize that I'm
destined for bigger things.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.788
And I want you to write
the script, jane.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.091
Oh. No.
No, no, no, I couldn't.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.227
If I have to die, I want
you to do it. Please.

25:30.229 --> 25:35.232
And I want you to write me
the greatest death scene ever.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.735
(laughs):
Oh.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.237
Ah. Is that all?

25:40.239 --> 25:42.072
I'm serious.
I know.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.642
(phone vibrating)

25:44.644 --> 25:46.110
Hello?

25:46.112 --> 25:48.612
Jane. Hi. It's luisa.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.781
I was just wondering
if you decided

25:50.783 --> 25:53.684
To give my letter to-to rose.

25:56.187 --> 25:57.988
Oh. Ah.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.658
You gave it to rafael.
All right.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.202
(ringtone playing)

26:17.042 --> 26:19.343
(quietly):
Pick up, rafael, pick up.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.612
(ringtone continues)
(doorbell rings)

26:25.350 --> 26:27.351
Rafael (recorded):
You have reached rafael solano.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.219
Please leave a message.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.356
Can we take a walk?

26:32.358 --> 26:37.161
Raf, please, at least
read the letter.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.830
Please.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.832
(whispers):
I'm scared.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.001
I'm scared, rafael.
I know. I understand.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.170
Your father wants me to leave
with him in two days.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.005
And you won't.
Don't worry.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.773
Look, if we don't go
to the police,

26:49.775 --> 26:52.142
We could get into trouble;
we could be seen as accessories.

26:52.144 --> 26:55.079
To what? There is nothing
tying him to those tunnels.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.916
Rose:
What?

26:58.918 --> 27:00.951
What is it?

27:02.654 --> 27:04.154
(chuckles):
Who the hell are you?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.689
Just hoping that
maybe if you could

27:05.691 --> 27:06.957
Tell me who
hired you...

27:06.959 --> 27:09.927
Who is that
talking to emilio?

27:09.929 --> 27:12.229
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And he didn't want</i>
<i>to speak it aloud,</i>

27:12.231 --> 27:14.031
<i>But he knew he had to.</i>

27:14.033 --> 27:15.332
I'm pretty sure that's
the subcontractor

27:15.334 --> 27:18.235
Who built the tunnels.

27:21.172 --> 27:23.107
And what's
your name again?

27:23.109 --> 27:24.108
Michael cordero.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.943
Oh, yes, there you are.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.277
Well, the doctor
will be with you shortly.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.880
Uh, what is it
you're looking to do exactly?

27:29.882 --> 27:30.948
Well, I'm not sure.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.816
Um, I guess I just kind of want

27:32.818 --> 27:34.852
To freshen up
my looks a little bit.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.720
Latin lover narrator: <i>Weird.</i>
<i>That's</i> <i>how michael thinks</i>

27:36.722 --> 27:38.288
<i>He'll get jane back?</i>
<i>You know?</i>

27:38.290 --> 27:40.124
What would you suggest?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.893
Surgery's not gonna fix
your posture.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.096
But... You could use pecs.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.132
There's nothing really
wrong with my pecs.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.700
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh. It's the plastic surgeon</i>

27:49.702 --> 27:51.669
<i>Whose number he stole.</i>
<i>You know, the guy</i>

27:51.671 --> 27:54.038
<i>Who might have been doing</i>
<i>surgery in the secret tunnels.</i>

27:54.040 --> 27:55.239
(knocking)

27:55.241 --> 27:56.807
Dr. Moncada,
it's mr. Meyer.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.876
He says it's an emergency.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.878
I'll be right back.
Take your time.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.132
(whispers):
God.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.834
(exhales)

28:27.005 --> 28:29.239
Slow down, mr. Meyer.
What's going on?

28:29.241 --> 28:31.141
Man: It's like it's all-all red
and infected.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.243
At the site of the injection?

28:33.245 --> 28:35.212
(panting)

28:35.214 --> 28:37.414
(mutters)

28:37.416 --> 28:39.249
(whispers):
Oh, come on.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.417
Look, mr. Meyer...

28:40.419 --> 28:43.087
It's like my whole face
is seizing up.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.422
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I should explain.</i>

28:45.424 --> 28:47.491
<i>Remember this?</i>

28:51.262 --> 28:52.396
Look, mr. Meyer...

28:52.398 --> 28:54.131
Now-now my jaw's locking up.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.332
(whispers):
Come on! Go!

28:57.102 --> 28:59.803
I'm gonna put you on
the phone with my nurse.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.105
Nurse:
Hello, mr. Meyer?

29:01.107 --> 29:03.407
Come on. Come on.

29:11.349 --> 29:12.483
(sighs)

29:13.885 --> 29:15.886
Jane:
<i>"that was too close!</i>

29:15.888 --> 29:17.488
That was way, way too close!"

29:17.490 --> 29:19.323
Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes. Jane, you'll remember,

29:19.325 --> 29:21.425
<i>Was currently at work</i>

29:21.427 --> 29:24.328
<i>On the greatest death scene</i>
<i>ever written.</i>

29:24.330 --> 29:25.996
Rogelio:
Yes, I know.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.767
Oh.

29:31.236 --> 29:33.937
I'm sorry, this is not
working for me at all.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.873
See, this is exactly
why you got fired.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.441
You're really screwing
the pooch here, jane.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.409
And I don't even know what
"screwing the pooch" means.

29:39.411 --> 29:40.410
That's how bad
your dialogue is.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.146
I meant it ironically.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.547
Exactly. You have
too much distance.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.783
You have to embrace
a telenovela.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.285
Fine. I will.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.221
Ow!

29:51.223 --> 29:52.422
What the hell?

29:54.292 --> 29:55.893
What was that for?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.961
I'm embracing the telenovela.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.131
Alba:
<i>Mi amor.</i>

30:03.234 --> 30:04.968
Eh. Not so good.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.837
There's too much pressure.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.172
Rogelio asked me to write

30:08.174 --> 30:10.574
The greatest death scene
ever written.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.209
<i>Bueno.</i>

30:17.448 --> 30:20.484
I couldn't afford gold earrings
like the ones I lost,

30:20.486 --> 30:22.820
But I hope you still like them.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.026
Ah.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.928
Gracias.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.031
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And suddenly,</i>

30:34.033 --> 30:35.332
<i>Jane knew exactly</i>
<i>how she wanted</i>

30:35.334 --> 30:37.434
<i>Rogelio's last episode to end.</i>

30:37.436 --> 30:38.936
Thank you, abuela.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.838
(chuckles)

30:43.842 --> 30:46.476
Jane, remember to
make me strong.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.212
But also vulnerable.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.446
And sexy.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.014
Always keep it sexy.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.350
I got it. I got it.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.586
Nadine.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.354
What are you
doing here?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.456
Wait. You were right.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.625
I went to the plastic surgeon,
dr. Moncada...

31:01.627 --> 31:03.460
What?
I had to check him out.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.429
We were working on that.
I'm getting a warrant.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.331
And you'll still get one,
but listen, you were right.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.433
Sin rostro's not rafael,
it's emilio.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.369
I have evidence linking him
to the plastic surgeon.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.504
It's a record of
electronic payment transfers

31:14.506 --> 31:16.506
From an account
in emilio's name to the doctor.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.475
This connects emilio
to the plastic surgeon,

31:18.477 --> 31:20.310
Who is connected
to the subcontractor,

31:20.312 --> 31:21.912
Who built the tunnels.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.281
We need to get an arrest
warrant for emilio.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.515
Right now.

31:31.389 --> 31:35.459
"it was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

31:35.461 --> 31:37.361
Charles dickens said that.
Mm.

31:37.363 --> 31:41.198
And it might as well have been
written for this moment.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.934
Or the french
revolution.

31:43.936 --> 31:45.168
Perhaps.

31:45.170 --> 31:48.572
Jane, your scene is beautiful.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.941
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.009
I love it.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.577
And I wonder
who's playing my son.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.412
Nicholas:
That would be me.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.548
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Surprising, I know.</i>

31:58.550 --> 32:02.119
<i>But this has actually been in</i>
<i>the works for quite some time.</i>

32:02.121 --> 32:03.420
They're running an hour behind.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.056
Keep tanning.
Okay, thank you.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.158
Dina: <i>He's refusing to come out</i>
<i>of his dressing room,</i>

32:08.160 --> 32:10.160
And he knows
we're waiting for him!

32:10.162 --> 32:14.031
I'll get him here. I just
need a few more minutes.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.333
Just three teeny weeny
little lines

32:16.335 --> 32:18.135
I'd like them to
change, please.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.369
Oh, my god.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.104
He rewrote every one
of his lines.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.373
Who does he think he is?
Let me talk to him.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.442
Okay, the script is great.
I'll get him there.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.145
What?

32:28.147 --> 32:31.081
Nothing, it's nothing.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.184
It's just... The writers were
backstage last night

32:34.186 --> 32:36.320
Making jokes about your weight.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.388
They said they were gonna
hide the crullers.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.557
I am the star of this
show! I was just voted

32:40.559 --> 32:42.659
<i>People en espaÃ±ol's</i>
<i>sexiest man alive!</i>

32:42.661 --> 32:44.728
Now give me that cruller!

32:48.199 --> 32:51.568
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And how did he land</i>
<i>such a prized role?</i>

32:51.570 --> 32:53.570
<i>He gave a great audition.</i>

32:53.572 --> 32:56.206
But I don't understand.

32:56.208 --> 33:00.177
Even if you wanted a part,
you didn't have to get me fired.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.479
Of course I did.

33:02.481 --> 33:06.116
You'd always see me
as your assistant.

33:06.118 --> 33:09.252
Plus, I needed
a spectacular entrance.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.121
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

33:11.123 --> 33:15.192
Your father was the one who told
me to keep my eyes on the prize.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.293
I think you missed the point.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.995
Well, I didn't
want to wait

33:17.997 --> 33:19.396
Until I was 39 to get famous.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.031
I'm 35.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.199
You're not.

33:22.201 --> 33:23.567
Go away, please.

33:23.569 --> 33:24.568
Mm.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.570
Fine.

33:26.572 --> 33:29.106
I'll see you out there.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.108
Dad.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.678
I can't believe him.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.246
What a horrible person.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.248
Jane, if you don't mind,

33:38.250 --> 33:41.418
I need a moment
to prepare for my death, please.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.626
Well, you're officially right.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.461
I'm too trusting.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.296
But I just don't want
to live in a world

33:53.298 --> 33:55.232
Where people are this awful.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.200
Funny. I was just
thinking about the fact

33:57.202 --> 33:59.102
That I like that you believe
the best in people.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.104
I come from the world's most

34:01.106 --> 34:02.606
Screwed-up family.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.574
I'm just glad you don't.

34:04.576 --> 34:07.677
Well, you know why it's so easy
for me to forgive your sister?

34:07.679 --> 34:09.679
Why?

34:09.681 --> 34:11.581
Because her mistake gave me

34:11.583 --> 34:13.617
The two most important things
in my life.

34:15.353 --> 34:18.255
So maybe just read the letter.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.323
And then decide.

34:22.593 --> 34:24.194
Well played.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.762
Again.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.799
(sighs)

34:28.801 --> 34:31.301
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And back to our</i>
<i>other</i> telenovela.

34:31.303 --> 34:34.104
Petra:
Milos, please let me go.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.705
You're not going anywhere.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.340
Director:
<i>Action.</i>

34:42.313 --> 34:44.247
Magda: What do
you want, milos?

34:44.249 --> 34:46.650
Anything.
I'm holding the
only thing I want.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.352
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.191
But she doesn't want me.

35:06.704 --> 35:08.605
You think you could
hide from me forever?

35:11.476 --> 35:13.376
You think I would
never find you?
No.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.246
And now that we're here...

35:18.116 --> 35:19.282
...Together again...

35:21.219 --> 35:22.886
...You will never
leave me again.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.367
I don't care anymore.
I'd rather die than be with you.

35:39.237 --> 35:40.337
Suit yourself.
Oh!

35:42.406 --> 35:44.474
(grunts)

35:53.217 --> 35:54.351
No!

36:00.858 --> 36:02.359
Monster!

36:02.361 --> 36:03.560
Petra!

36:07.832 --> 36:09.699
You can walk, mother?

36:09.701 --> 36:11.301
You-you... You just...

36:11.303 --> 36:12.602
Oh, stop. It's just fake blood.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.671
You can buy it
at any Halloween store.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.872
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I should explain.</i>

36:15.874 --> 36:17.607
<i>Remember the koruna?</i>

36:17.609 --> 36:19.176
<i>It always comes back</i>

36:19.178 --> 36:20.944
<i>To a koruna with these two.</i>
<i>Shh.</i>

36:20.946 --> 36:23.847
It's okay, it's okay.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.448
I need to tell
you something.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.450
Your mother lied
to keep us apart.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.519
I never cheated on you.
Stop this.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.787
She's a liar.
No, she's not.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.423
It's true, petra.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.658
She can walk.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.360
(scoffs) I don't believe you.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.562
Please.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.297
Let me try and
prove it to you.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.365
You've been lying to me?

36:42.367 --> 36:44.334
All these years? Why? Why?

36:44.336 --> 36:45.735
T-to manipulate me?

36:45.737 --> 36:47.537
Listen, petra, I...

36:47.539 --> 36:48.972
Get out!

36:48.974 --> 36:51.241
Just get out now!

37:12.597 --> 37:14.831
(grunts)

37:18.836 --> 37:20.837
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so santos said the words</i>

37:20.839 --> 37:22.739
<i>Alba said some 13 years ago.</i>

37:54.639 --> 37:57.707
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And... Scene.</i>

38:07.885 --> 38:10.453
Thank you. Thank you, director.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.455
Thank you, cameraman.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.957
Thank you.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.558
Thank you,
men in cargo shorts.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.327
Thank you all.

38:19.363 --> 38:22.332
(voice breaking):
You were incredible, dad.

38:22.334 --> 38:25.302
Did you just call me dad?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.804
I think I did.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.374
I have this feeling
in my chest now.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.410
It feels kind of warm.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.545
But also it wants
to explode or something.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.614
I don't quite
understand what's...

38:39.483 --> 38:41.484
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Forget the worst of times.</i>

38:41.486 --> 38:44.387
<i>It was straight up</i>
<i>the best of times.</i>

38:44.389 --> 38:47.390
<i>But not for rafael, who knew</i>

38:47.392 --> 38:49.426
<i>He had to read luisa's letter.</i>

38:49.428 --> 38:52.429
<i>"dear rose, I need you</i>
<i>to listen to me..."</i>

38:52.431 --> 38:54.431
<i>Wait, what am I doing?</i>

38:54.433 --> 38:56.399
<i>Luisa should be reading this.</i>

38:56.401 --> 38:59.569
Luisa: <i>"dear rose, I need to you</i>
<i>to listen to me</i>

38:59.571 --> 39:02.105
<i>"because you're the only one</i>
<i>who knows I'm not crazy.</i>

39:02.107 --> 39:04.341
<i>"I'm worried for your safety.</i>

39:04.343 --> 39:06.976
<i>"I was in dad's apartment</i>
<i>the night the bellboy died,</i>

39:06.978 --> 39:09.579
<i>"and I was... Drinking.</i>

39:09.581 --> 39:11.815
<i>"I used a corkscrew.</i>
<i>I left for an hour,</i>

39:11.817 --> 39:13.883
<i>"and when I came back,</i>
<i>the corkscrew was gone.</i>

39:13.885 --> 39:16.353
"I thought it was very strange.

39:16.355 --> 39:19.422
<i>"but now I know</i>
<i>a bellboy was murdered.</i>

39:20.524 --> 39:22.425
<i>"I have a bad feeling, rose,</i>

39:22.427 --> 39:23.827
<i>"about my father.</i>

39:23.829 --> 39:26.429
<i>You need to get away, rose,</i>
<i>right now."</i>

39:26.431 --> 39:27.764
Emilio: <i>Rose...</i>
<i>Rose:</i> <i>Mm-hmm?</i>

39:29.834 --> 39:32.836
You have been acting so
strange since I got back.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.704
I am not acting strange.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.539
Yes, you are.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.042
It makes me think you don't
want to come away with me.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.877
I do.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.412
Of course I do.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.414
Good, because...

39:44.416 --> 39:45.949
I have moved up our trip.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.450
We're leaving tonight.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.685
What?

39:48.687 --> 39:50.153
Is there a problem?

39:54.458 --> 39:55.959
Rafael.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.961
Oh, I wish you could've
been there.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.797
Rogelio was amazing.

40:00.799 --> 40:04.501
And-and it was just incredible,
because I felt like...

40:07.638 --> 40:09.406
What's wrong?

40:12.443 --> 40:14.944
I think my dad is sin rostro.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.479
What are you doing?

40:16.481 --> 40:18.448
What do you think I'm doing?

40:18.450 --> 40:19.482
Here?

40:19.484 --> 40:21.518
Why not?

40:21.520 --> 40:24.053
Mm. Inside here.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.823
No.
No one will see.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.058
Come on.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.094
(chuckling)

40:31.096 --> 40:33.163
Come in.

40:33.165 --> 40:36.099
Not yet.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.568
Oh.

40:40.671 --> 40:42.806
Where are you going?

40:45.943 --> 40:47.911
(machine whirring)

40:47.913 --> 40:49.646
(screams)

41:04.061 --> 41:05.662
(machine whirring)

41:05.664 --> 41:08.131
(splashing)

41:09.767 --> 41:11.835
(splashing stops)

41:21.645 --> 41:23.713
(line ringing)

41:25.649 --> 41:27.617
Rafael, it's rose.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.619
Call me back.

41:29.621 --> 41:32.121
I was supposed to meet your
father, but he didn't show.

41:32.123 --> 41:35.091
I... I think he's already
left the country.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.771
(whistling tune)

<i>I'm as surprised as you are.</i>
