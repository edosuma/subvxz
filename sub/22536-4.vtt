WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:07.628
We're working with homes
for humankind to build
houses in new york.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.438
I'm your mother,
amber, I get to worry.
This is agent finley's first

00:10.440 --> 00:13.000
Inner perimeter assignment.
But you'd take a bullet
for me, right?

00:13.010 --> 00:16.173
I was trained to protect
your life; I wouldn't
be here if I weren't.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.274
Koz:
We know who you are. We talked
to the agents in that other suv.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.679
Movement.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.147
Hurst?
(gunshot)

00:22.150 --> 00:24.311
In 15 seconds
a truck is going to pull up.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.948
You are going to get off
this bus and onto that truck.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.383
"as you can tell
from the way you were taken,

00:29.390 --> 00:32.029
"we are professionals.
If you do not respect that,

00:32.030 --> 00:35.818
We are also very comfortable
with the use of force."

00:35.830 --> 00:37.491
And I don't want to hear any
"you're too emotionally close

00:37.500 --> 00:38.626
To do your job clearly" crap

00:38.630 --> 00:40.666
Because your niece
is on that bus.

00:40.670 --> 00:43.468
Your sister gives us access.
We're not _
on speaking terms, Sll'.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.529
Now you are.
And you just
want to see your kid?

00:45.540 --> 00:48.509
I know I said I never
wanted to, but now...

00:48.510 --> 00:50.978
I need to.

00:50.980 --> 00:52.242
Olsen: Tell me what you see.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.741
Dunn: Two men, mid-20$,
both unconscious.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.071
(gunshots)

00:57.090 --> 00:59.888
Our men are dead.
Fbi has both soldiers.

00:59.890 --> 01:01.983
We think he took those kids
to use their parents.

01:01.990 --> 01:04.254
Morgan roth, dunn's sister,
the ambassador--

01:04.260 --> 01:06.979
All used by the kidnapper.
Do as he says or their kids die.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.252
Call your friend, general
osborne, and tell him you

01:09.270 --> 01:11.090
Need to meet with him alone.
Tell him you have important

01:11.100 --> 01:13.091
White house business to discuss.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.003
And the nature of this business?

01:19.010 --> 01:21.399
Truth.
(electric crackling)

01:21.410 --> 01:22.570
Truth and pain.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.003
(panﬁng)

01:25.010 --> 01:26.341
(electric buzzing)

01:28.720 --> 01:30.176
Female reporter:
Breaking news in the
ballard school kidnapping...

01:30.190 --> 01:31.418
Male reporter:
Now a tragic development...

01:31.420 --> 01:33.183
Female reporter 2:
A death today

01:33.190 --> 01:35.078
In the ballard kidnapping case,
but not of a child.

01:35.090 --> 01:37.183
This was a parent.
Male reporter 2: A parent dead.

01:37.190 --> 01:39.351
(overlapping news reports)

01:41.100 --> 01:43.352
_Olsen:
Press IS gonna have
a lot of questions.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.965
They're gonna want to know
how that parent died.

01:46.970 --> 01:49.291
That parent died for their kid.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.369
Because the kidnapper
left them no choice.

01:53.140 --> 01:54.698
Olsen:
Dunn?

01:58.710 --> 02:00.769
If we do get their
daughter back...

02:02.050 --> 02:04.109
...How do we explain
that to her?

02:06.420 --> 02:09.389
You've been a congressman
a long time, mr. Wirth.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.221
Four terms.

02:11.230 --> 02:13.448
You've sent a_ lot
of men and women Into battle.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.258
(distorted):
Today it's your turn.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.659
Do you understand how to use
what I've given you?

02:18.670 --> 02:19.762
Please don't
make us do this.

02:19.770 --> 02:21.397
Mrs. Wirth, do you

02:21.400 --> 02:23.630
Understand how to use
what I've given you?

02:23.640 --> 02:25.232
Yes.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.435
You're scared.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.079
Make your love for your daughter

02:30.080 --> 02:32.139
Stronger than your fear
of what is to come.

02:33.310 --> 02:34.868
(phone snaps shut)

02:42.090 --> 02:45.082
You really think he'll
put that vest on?
Wouldn't you?

02:45.090 --> 02:46.819
To save your daughter?

02:46.830 --> 02:48.491
No kids.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.798
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.964
Olsen:
The people who took your kids
are using them as leverage.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.369
The people who took your kids

02:56.370 --> 02:59.965
Are asking you to make
an impossible choice.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.834
If you have been contacted,

03:01.840 --> 03:04.001
It is essential
that you let us know.

03:04.010 --> 03:06.672
Do not comply
with any demands.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.615
I know it's a
difficult decision.

03:09.620 --> 03:12.316
So I'll make it easy
for you to say no.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.049
As of this moment,

03:14.060 --> 03:16.688
Each of you is the subject

03:16.690 --> 03:18.555
Of an fbi investigation.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.222
And your movements
will be watched,

03:21.230 --> 03:23.698
You_r communications
Will be monitored.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.419
We will not let them use you.

03:28.170 --> 03:30.229
That is a promise.

03:39.180 --> 03:42.172
Did you know the proof of life
photo of amber you gave me

03:44.990 --> 03:46.389
They told me I
would see amber

03:46.390 --> 03:48.984
And they left that
photo instead.

03:48.990 --> 03:52.482
You weren't told to get
that photo into the fbi?

03:52.490 --> 03:53.582
No.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.256
You don't believe me.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.091
I think you lied to me
when you gave me that photo,

04:00.100 --> 04:01.089
I think you're lying
to me now,

04:01.100 --> 04:04.069
And if I could prove it,
I would lock you up.

04:05.710 --> 04:08.907
Two days ago
you begged me to find her.

04:08.910 --> 04:12.004
I'd never seen you like that.
You were so scared.

04:12.010 --> 04:14.672
But this...
This is the meg I remember.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.171
The meg who
controls everything.

04:19.690 --> 04:21.715
I'm still scared.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.915
I'm still begging
you to find amber.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.625
But...

04:25.630 --> 04:28.952
I think you need to focus
on the investigation

04:28.960 --> 04:32.498
And not on whatever
hostility you have for me.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.834
If you want to find
your daughter.

04:39.370 --> 04:42.100
Do you know why the ambassador's
son was let go?

04:43.380 --> 04:46.543
I assume one
or both of his parents

04:46.550 --> 04:49.269
Did what the kidnappers asked.

04:49.290 --> 04:53.317
Your wife did what they asked.
Why didn't they let amber go?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.686
Did you ask her?

04:57.430 --> 04:59.955
Aren't you curious?

04:59.960 --> 05:03.225
Because I am real curious
about that.

05:03.230 --> 05:05.289
If I tell you I don't
know, you'll just

05:05.300 --> 05:07.165
Tell me that I'm lying.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.038
Maybe you're not the right
person for this case.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.200
You know your anger
makes you careless.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.856
(rhythmic scratching)

05:35.600 --> 05:37.488
My meds.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.492
Considering the circumstances,
I'm adjusting the dose.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.990
You want a bump?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.389
No, I don't.

05:46.870 --> 05:48.428
Downstairs.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.177
Now.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.239
Everyone downstairs now!

05:57.020 --> 05:59.011
Move. Let's go.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.442
All right, let's go.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.679
Move it, move it,
move it, let's go.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.891
Last names. "a" through "m"

06:10.900 --> 06:12.367
To the right. "n" through "2"

06:12.370 --> 06:14.224
To the left.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.298
Move.

06:27.050 --> 06:29.314
"you will take a stack
of money exactly three

06:29.320 --> 06:32.209
"inches high. You will wrap this
in foil. You will put three

06:32.220 --> 06:34.882
"of these stacks in a bag. You
will fill the rest of the bag

06:34.890 --> 06:37.814
"with exactly four
ounces of coffee beans.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.879
"you will seal the bag and put
six of these bags in a box.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.549
"you will
seal the box

06:42.560 --> 06:44.152
"and stack the boxes.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.264
"there are 250,000 bills here.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.488
"you will not sleep
until this is done.

06:51.570 --> 06:54.869
"the group that
stacks the most boxes...

06:54.880 --> 06:57.769
Will not be punished."

06:57.780 --> 07:00.078
Man:
All right, let's go, move.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.173
Move, let's go.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.875
Shaﬂene:
Coffee?

07:03.890 --> 07:06.211
For smuggling.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.518
Dogs won't be able
to smell all that cash.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.353
Congressman wirth.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.193
Congressman wirth,
mrs. Wirth.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.861
Can we help you?
I'm agent pender.

07:19.870 --> 07:21.428
We're the fbi escorts.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.964
We're on the first shift
with you today.

07:22.970 --> 07:24.767
There are so many of you.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.635
Two for you, two
for your husband.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.107
Marie here is
my chief of staff.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.475
Where I go, she goes.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.301
Then it will just be the
six of us. Shall we?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.540
You want to tell me
why you didn't want me

07:39.560 --> 07:41.585
In that interview
with your sister?
No, I don't.

07:41.590 --> 07:43.057
You recorded that
interview so I could

07:43.060 --> 07:44.755
Maybe listen
to it later?
No, I didn't.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.081
You want to ask me any more
questions on this line?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.591
No, ma'am. Your
family, your rules.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.990
You back up your partner
because that's what partners do?
That's how I learned it.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.298
Except when they shoot you.
Except when they shoot you.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.837
I'm ms. Fletcher,
I work in the office here.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.899
Are you the fbi agents
in charge of the parents?

07:59.910 --> 08:01.935
_ Yes.
I just saw mrs. Yarrow,
senator yarrow's wife,

08:01.940 --> 08:03.999
Lock herself in the band room.

08:04.010 --> 08:06.444
Her daughter, sloan,
was on the bus.
Where's that room?

08:06.450 --> 08:08.418
Down this hall.
Could you see what
mrs. Yarrow was doing?

08:08.420 --> 08:10.513
Yes. She was crying.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.810
Luke:
Lamborghini.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.229
Lamborghini.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.352
Lamborghini.
Luke, maybe you could stop that.

08:24.830 --> 08:29.767
Maserati.
Maserati.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.169
Ian:
He's whiffed.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.536
Beth ann: What?
Ian: Luke-- he's high.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.599
This morning, in the shower,
he was snorting his meds.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.032
Perfect.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.847
Was lqle
doing it, too?

08:38.850 --> 08:40.147
No.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.447
Why?

08:43.890 --> 08:45.141
(whispering):
Are you blushing?

08:45.150 --> 08:46.879
No.

08:46.890 --> 08:49.381
I got punched in the face,
remember? It's a bruise.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.755
Keep working.

08:54.730 --> 08:58.393
Mrs. Yarrow,
can you hear me?

08:58.400 --> 09:01.858
Mrs. Yarrow,
you need to open the door.

09:01.870 --> 09:05.499
I can't see.
Her husband's a senator.
He's got real power

09:05.510 --> 09:07.137
The kidnapper could use.
Where are those damn keys?

09:07.140 --> 09:10.678
Woman:
You got a call?
Yes, this morning.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.671
Mrs. Yarrow, open the door.
Mrs. Yarrow,

09:12.680 --> 09:14.671
Open the door.
(phone rings)

09:14.680 --> 09:16.739
Dunn.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.048
A ballard parent
is on the damn news.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.018
I'm sending you
a link right now.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.612
Woman:
What did the caller ask?

09:24.390 --> 09:27.086
Mrs. Yarrow:
To read this.
Hey.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.092
"we have taken your children.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.022
"they're ours now.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.590
"you should have been
more careful with them

09:34.600 --> 09:37.763
"when... When they were
with you.

09:37.770 --> 09:40.364
"attempts to find them
will result in their deaths.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.235
"attempts to find us
will result in their deaths.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.377
"you had control. That is over.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.200
You had power. It is ours now."

09:47.220 --> 09:50.109
(shrieks)
wait, now that you've
read that statement,

09:50.120 --> 09:52.918
Your child gets to come home?
Mrs. Yarrow, I am asking
you to stop talking now.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.286
You need to turn that off.
No, no, not yet. There's more.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.053
What else has been asked of you?
Please stop talking right now.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.028
I get sloan back
after my husband does

09:59.030 --> 10:00.554
What they've asked him to do.
And which is what?

10:00.560 --> 10:03.097
No, wait, out.

10:07.070 --> 10:10.039
What did the kidnapper
ask your husband to do?

10:10.040 --> 10:13.100
I don't know... I don't
know what. I only know where.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.738
Finley:
Where did the kidnappers send
your husband, mrs. Yarrow?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.935
They didn't send him anywhere.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.202
He's still here.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.780
Somewhere in
this building.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.941
We need to evacuate the school.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.255
I want to thank
you for everything

10:35.830 --> 10:37.752
You parents are like
our family at ballard.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.397
Your children
are our children.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.891
All you had to do was ask.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.265
It shouldn't be much longer.

10:43.270 --> 10:45.568
Here they come.

10:45.570 --> 10:46.798
I'm not sure
I can do this.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.903
Stay strong. We'll get

10:48.910 --> 10:50.969
Your sloan back home.

10:50.980 --> 10:54.438
Swat and bomb squad
just cleared that school.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.815
No sign of
your husband.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.173
No sign of tampering
of any kind.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.647
Where is your husband,
mrs. Yarrow?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.446
Finley:
I think it's time to put

11:01.460 --> 11:03.416
You two women in
separate rooms.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.758
Man:
You will go faster!

11:10.770 --> 11:12.419
You do not

11:12.430 --> 11:13.761
Want to be on the

11:13.770 --> 11:15.237
Losing side today.

11:17.370 --> 11:18.803
It must be aziz's
parents' money.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.209
They must have
paid his ransom.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.632
That's why he's out.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.107
They took your proof of life,

11:23.110 --> 11:24.839
So you'll be out, too.

11:26.010 --> 11:29.070
She'll pay,
and you'll be out.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.259
Amber, I'm so sorry.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.865
Sorry for what you did,

11:49.870 --> 11:51.497
Or sorry for lying about it?

11:51.510 --> 11:53.637
I'm sorry for
hurting you.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.559
Man:
Hey, kid.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.987
(grunting)

12:14.000 --> 12:16.821
Francis:
Hey! Hey, stop!

12:18.370 --> 12:19.769
He broke the rules.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.238
(panﬁng)

12:22.240 --> 12:24.936
Help me.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.270
Here, tilt
his head back.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.212
Come on, come on.

12:38.220 --> 12:41.439
Jin, come on!
One, two, three, four...

12:41.460 --> 12:43.553
This boy needs help!

12:43.560 --> 12:44.913
Can you hear me?

12:44.930 --> 12:47.228
You need to come
out here!

12:47.230 --> 12:48.379
What the hell?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.220
Come on, jin,
hey, stay with us.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.221
He's not breathing.
Tilt his head back.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.197
Come on, jin.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.758
(counting faintly)

13:03.410 --> 13:06.777
(door opens)
_ mrs. Devore:
Meg, It's so good to see you.

13:08.550 --> 13:09.869
(grunts)

13:13.120 --> 13:14.985
(sighs)

13:14.990 --> 13:17.151
Have you seen any of
the other parents?

13:17.160 --> 13:18.582
This morning at the school.

13:18.590 --> 13:19.955
How are they doing?

13:19.960 --> 13:21.552
They're in shock.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.324
Frank becloNith
and dark froy weren't there.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.298
Froy's been shot,
becloNith's arrested.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.734
My husband's
chief of staff--

13:28.740 --> 13:30.230
The kidnappers got to
him in the white house.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.639
They made him
torture someone.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.734
My god.
(groans)

13:37.610 --> 13:39.942
But he... He got
his kid back.

13:39.950 --> 13:43.477
They said you'll get him
back if you torture someone,

13:43.490 --> 13:46.846
And frank said yes.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.953
I'm going to get a call.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.282
The amount of power
my husband has.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.953
He-he won't do what they say,
but I didn't take an oath.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.667
I'm going to do something
terrible to get kyle back.

13:58.670 --> 14:02.037
We take care _
of our children, julla.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.703
That's what we have to do now.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.962
We can't leave this to others.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.177
I know that this_is hard for
you, not to be In control.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.341
We have to let
the fbi do this.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.102
What if they can't, julia?

14:15.120 --> 14:18.544
This kidnapping is about us.

14:18.550 --> 14:22.384
Ambassador rind,
morgan roth, me, beckwith,

14:22.390 --> 14:25.450
Froy, and soon, you.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.826
We are being used.

14:27.830 --> 14:30.219
The fbi doesn't understand us.

14:30.230 --> 14:32.323
Not really.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.731
Make a call for me, julia.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.368
Get me access to the fbi,

14:38.370 --> 14:42.830
So I can see what it is
that they're seeing.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.809
Then I can help us
get our kids back.

14:45.810 --> 14:49.473
_ (crying):
What If It's not enough?

14:49.480 --> 14:51.880
What if we can't save them?

14:51.890 --> 14:54.916
Make that call for me, julia.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.921
The kidnappers are gonna come
for all of us.

15:00.930 --> 15:03.524
We have to protect ourselves.

15:03.530 --> 15:06.693
(breath quivering)

15:06.700 --> 15:08.167
(crying)

15:08.170 --> 15:11.389
(sniffling)

15:11.410 --> 15:12.832
(computer chirping)

15:12.840 --> 15:14.330
Dunn:
Any of you parents

15:14.340 --> 15:17.036
Could get
into that school.

15:17.050 --> 15:21.202
Why would the kidnapper waste a
senator doing something there?

15:21.220 --> 15:23.176
Your husband was never
at ballard, was he?

15:23.180 --> 15:25.114
Finley:
We just wasted
time and resources

15:25.120 --> 15:27.384
Searching that school.

15:27.390 --> 15:30.518
Time and resources we
need to find those kids.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.384
Help us.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.051
Where's your husband,
mrs. Yarrow?

15:34.060 --> 15:37.689
My husband is out
getting our daughter back.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.362
Why would you want me
to stop him from doing that?

15:40.370 --> 15:42.133
Finley:
You were the one
who told us where

15:42.140 --> 15:44.199
To find mrs. Yarrow.
You've been

15:44.210 --> 15:45.768
Helping her
right from the start.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.533
I was just trying to help.

15:47.540 --> 15:48.973
Did you help senator yarrow,
too?

15:48.980 --> 15:50.971
His car was still
In the school's

15:50.980 --> 15:53.073
Parking lot,
but yours wasn't, ms. Fletcher.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.877
Dunn:
Do you know where he is?

15:54.880 --> 15:56.279
Yarrow:
Yes.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.713
Dunn:
Do you know what he's doing?

15:57.720 --> 15:59.119
Yes.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.747
And if he injures other people?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.081
That guilt belongs
to the kidnapper.

16:03.090 --> 16:05.479
They made this happen.

16:05.490 --> 16:08.379
My husband is getting
my daughter back.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.129
He knows

16:10.130 --> 16:11.995
It will ruin him,
but he will

16:12.000 --> 16:13.422
Get it done.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.123
Finley:
Where is your car?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.096
I don't think
I'm going to tell you that.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.737
It won't take us long
to find out.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.264
That will be more time
for senator yarrow

16:20.280 --> 16:22.077
To go get sloan.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.230
Dunn:
Last night;

16:24.250 --> 16:25.945
A man was tortured

16:25.950 --> 16:27.303
By one of the parents.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.710
Tortured and then made
to kill himself.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.311
Your husband could be doing
something very dangerous.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.686
You're the ones
who are dangerous.

16:37.690 --> 16:40.329
You will get my sloan killed.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.321
You're dangerous
if you stop

16:42.330 --> 16:43.991
My husband.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.932
You!

16:51.940 --> 16:52.929
What? What did...?

16:52.940 --> 16:54.805
What did I do?
No.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.334
We got some questions
about where you used to work!

16:56.340 --> 16:58.479
No!No!No!
(groaning)

16:58.480 --> 17:01.278
You have to stop, or they will
hurt you, too. You have to stop!
Get off me!

17:01.280 --> 17:02.542
Get off me!
Don't ever touch me!

17:02.550 --> 17:04.142
They were going
to hurt you, too.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.640
It's your secret
service guy in there.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.447
_He's in there
right now, and

17:07.460 --> 17:08.882
He's the whole reason
that we're doing...

17:08.890 --> 17:10.152
All right, back to
work, all of you!

17:10.160 --> 17:11.013
Now!

17:13.360 --> 17:16.227
You okay?

17:16.230 --> 17:19.358
Your father used to work
for the government, right?

17:19.370 --> 17:22.339
We weren't supposed
to talk about it,

17:22.340 --> 17:24.331
But he worked
for the cia.

17:24.340 --> 17:26.900
Cia?

17:26.910 --> 17:30.004
They are totally gonna
tune your father up.

17:30.010 --> 17:33.047
C-I-effing-a.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.347
(sighs)

17:37.350 --> 17:39.045
Koz:
A heart attack

17:39.050 --> 17:40.517
From the rifle blow.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.853
When a kid playing baseball
gets hit with a pitch.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.852
Except he wasn't
playing baseball.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.919
He broke the rules.

17:48.930 --> 17:51.592
I... I didn't ask
you to do this.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.700
I got a pulse.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.905
He's unconscious, but
at least he's breathing.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.188
(sighs)

18:17.390 --> 18:20.621
Comm:
Boss, gps shows
senator yarrow on the move.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.438
Where are the wirths?
Heading east.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.408
And their fbi escort?
Right behind them.

18:34.410 --> 18:37.607
Four agents in one car
about ten feet back.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.544
Open a secure line.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.939
(phon
e rin '
yes?gmg)

18:46.960 --> 18:48.712
Francis (distorted):
Do you have the vest with you?

18:48.720 --> 18:49.880
We do... In my briefcase.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.255
Where you are going,

18:51.260 --> 18:52.625
We will no longer be able
to communicate.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.951
It will just be you

18:54.960 --> 18:56.393
And what you need to do.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.822
Do you understand?

18:57.830 --> 18:59.821
We understand,
you son of a bitch.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.559
And we'll do whatever
you want us to do,

19:01.570 --> 19:03.128
But the fbi
is right behind us.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.131
How do you expect us
to lose them?

19:05.140 --> 19:07.938
In five minutes,
your fbi escort will be detained

19:07.940 --> 19:09.601
By local police.

19:09.610 --> 19:12.249
You will keep driving.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.502
On the 300 block of jefferson,
on the west side of the street,

19:14.520 --> 19:15.942
You will find a white accord.

19:15.950 --> 19:18.646
Unlocked, keys under the seat.

19:18.650 --> 19:21.084
Leave your own car.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.512
Take this one.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.080
Do you understand?

19:25.090 --> 19:26.489
Yes.

19:26.490 --> 19:27.957
Remember to bring the vest.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.827
Please, there must be
another way.

19:30.830 --> 19:34.425
Mrs. Wirth,
please tell your husband

19:34.440 --> 19:37.261
What you, as a mother,
understand by now.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.547
There is no other way.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.886
Are you into d.C. Metro pd?
Yes.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.949
I've taken over
police dispatch.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.359
We have 30 seconds.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.952
Then do it.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.689
All units.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.328
All units, please
be advised.

20:03.330 --> 20:06.493
Ballard kidnappers driving
stolen black suv,

20:06.500 --> 20:09.139
Government plates sg3874,

20:09.140 --> 20:10.539
Heading east on cordell.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.338
All units, suspects are
armed and dangerous.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.308
Stop and detain.

20:18.750 --> 20:22.311
(siren wailing)

20:22.320 --> 20:24.379
Just keep driving.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.142
(siren wailing)

20:26.150 --> 20:28.914
Here's how this works.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.717
You will be allowed
limited access

20:30.730 --> 20:32.527
To facts not released
to the public.

20:32.530 --> 20:34.851
Limited?
It was not

20:34.860 --> 20:37.328
An all-access pass
the oval office got you.

20:37.330 --> 20:39.867
You can ask about anything
having to do

20:39.870 --> 20:41.861
With the other parents
in amber's class.

20:41.870 --> 20:44.088
Well, other parents were used
by the kidnappers.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.863
I want to find out what
the other parents have done.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.077
Well, may I ask why?

20:49.080 --> 20:51.605
They got their children back,
and I have not.

20:53.550 --> 20:57.042
Morgan roth helped bring down
a surveillance drone.

20:57.050 --> 21:00.816
Ambassador rind was forced
to allow access to...

21:02.460 --> 21:04.348
...Classified information.
What information

21:04.360 --> 21:05.827
Was that?

21:06.790 --> 21:09.850
Do I need
to call the first lady?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.090
The ambassador didn't know
what it was,

21:13.100 --> 21:16.763
So your... Question
does not concern a parent.

21:17.940 --> 21:20.033
Anything else?

21:20.040 --> 21:22.031
Yes, I need a file
of everything you have

21:22.040 --> 21:24.270
That does concern a parent.

21:26.610 --> 21:28.703
Ms. Fitch,

21:28.720 --> 21:31.769
What can you do with it

21:31.790 --> 21:34.588
That we can't?

21:34.590 --> 21:38.583
I have four times
your employees, a full 6,000

21:38.590 --> 21:40.251
Of which are phds,

21:40.260 --> 21:41.579
And ten times your budget.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.558
So, I imagine, quite a bit.

21:44.570 --> 21:47.027
(phone ringing)

21:53.940 --> 21:56.807
Which ones?

21:59.310 --> 22:02.245
Metro pd was alerted that our
fbi agents were the kidnappers.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.411
Eight units responded,
pulled our guys over.

22:04.420 --> 22:07.309
By the time it was sorted
out, the wirths were gone.

22:15.860 --> 22:17.293
Swat leader:
Over here.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.723
I found something.

22:27.370 --> 22:28.928
Dunn:
A bomb vest.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.329
First, senator yarrow
goes missing

22:31.350 --> 22:33.170
And now congressman wirth.
Why those two?

22:33.180 --> 22:34.772
Access.

22:34.780 --> 22:37.317
They both have secure access
to the capitol building.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.209
Call olsen. We need
to lock down the capitol.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.616
All right, meal break!

22:43.620 --> 22:46.453
Let's go!
Meal break! Move!

22:54.200 --> 22:56.259
(exhales)

22:57.370 --> 22:59.861
(sniffs)

23:01.140 --> 23:03.028
When I get out
of here,

23:03.040 --> 23:05.338
Nothing will ever be the same,
will it?

23:05.350 --> 23:09.719
No. Nothing will ever
be the same.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.041
It will be
about what happened here,

23:12.050 --> 23:14.416
Who got out, who didn't,
who died.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.181
What they did to us.
Amber,

23:18.190 --> 23:20.055
I know you.

23:21.830 --> 23:24.253
You do not have
to let this be your life.
But it is.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.060
It's already started.
(sighs)

23:30.740 --> 23:33.231
(chuckles)

23:37.880 --> 23:40.269
You have good hands.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.511
But I'm not a good person.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.988
I've met a lot worse lately.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.911
Break time is over.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.918
Amber,

23:56.930 --> 23:58.955
What do you think of my hands?

24:06.640 --> 24:08.437
Finley:
Wait. Dunn,

24:08.440 --> 24:10.431
The kidnappers had us chasing
our tail all day.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.907
First the school,
now the capitol.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.901
Something's not right.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.569
The wirths ditched

24:16.580 --> 24:18.377
Their fbi escorts where?

24:18.920 --> 24:20.410
Right here.

24:20.420 --> 24:21.739
From the ballard school,
that's headed away

24:21.760 --> 24:23.159
From the capitol.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.754
Where'd they find
connie fletcher's car?

24:25.760 --> 24:28.456
Here. That's headed away
from the capitol building, too.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.451
So if you start at
the ballard school,

24:30.470 --> 24:32.961
Head past where they ditched
their cars

24:32.970 --> 24:34.494
And keep going, what
else is out that way?

24:35.470 --> 24:36.789
Langley.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.461
That's cia.
Finley,

24:38.470 --> 24:40.461
Wirth and yarrow both sit on
intelligence committees, right?

24:40.480 --> 24:42.300
Yeah, they do.
That gives them access

24:42.310 --> 24:43.572
To the cia building.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.775
That black site
we found was Cla.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.771
One of our hostages is ex-cia.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.839
And now we have two parents
with access to the cia building.

24:49.850 --> 24:52.114
We sure see those three
letters a lot lately.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.111
Yes, ma'am, we sure do.
Don't call
me "ma'am."

24:54.120 --> 24:56.486
It's a term
of respect.
No, it's what cops call women

24:56.490 --> 24:57.752
They're forced to tolerate.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.580
We need to get
to the cia.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.320
I'm so s-scared.

25:02.330 --> 25:05.094
I know.
I am, too.
This is insane.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.499
We should call the fbi.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.663
Just listen to me.
The ambassador's son was let go.

25:09.670 --> 25:12.605
His parents must have done
what was asked of them.

25:12.610 --> 25:13.668
Did they have to put that on?

25:13.670 --> 25:15.433
I don't know.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.079
But they're both still alive
and their son is free.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.870
I want
our daughter back,

25:20.880 --> 25:22.302
And I want her back now.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.015
Today.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.715
I'm glad
we got the call

25:25.720 --> 25:28.689
'cause we can do this.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.510
I don't think I can put that on.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.953
When the time comes,

25:32.960 --> 25:35.520
You will.

25:42.170 --> 25:42.989
You got a call?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.638
This morning.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.039
What do you have for us?

25:46.040 --> 25:47.132
Is that vest real?

25:47.140 --> 25:48.129
We don't have
much time, senator.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.232
What do you have for us?

25:49.240 --> 25:50.400
The voice on the phone told me

25:50.410 --> 25:51.479
Where to find this.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.072
It was in
the vault.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.149
Here.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.539
Plug it into
your phone.

25:56.550 --> 25:59.246
You got to get 150 feet
away from the building,

25:59.250 --> 26:01.309
Otherwise the building will
jam the cell phone calls.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.483
So you have to get that far.
150 feet.

26:04.490 --> 26:07.379
Is that vest real?
No, it's not. It's just...

26:07.400 --> 26:09.527
How we-we could get
into the building.
But the guards

26:09.530 --> 26:12.351
Don't know that.
What else do I need
to know, mason?

26:12.370 --> 26:13.769
You take
that flash drive

26:13.770 --> 26:15.419
Out of the building,
the building's sensors

26:15.440 --> 26:17.396
Are gonna trigger the alarms.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.264
Why the fake vest?

26:19.270 --> 26:20.760
It's-it's a diversion.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.169
He wears it, everybody looks
at him, I walk

26:23.180 --> 26:24.772
The flash drive out
of the building.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.509
We don't need
a real vest for that.

26:26.510 --> 26:29.513
But the armed cia guards
won't know that.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.582
I-I can't put it on. I can't.

26:32.590 --> 26:35.514
We do what they ask,
we get our kids back.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.418
Then you put it on.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.681
I'll do it.

26:39.690 --> 26:41.521
I'll do it.
Marie...

26:41.530 --> 26:44.351
Shut up. Don't say anything.
Just-just take this.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.861
Plug it into your phone.
While everyone's looking at me,

26:46.870 --> 26:48.861
You get that 150 feet away
from the building,

26:48.870 --> 26:50.690
You send them whatever
they-they want to be sent

26:50.710 --> 26:52.189
And you get our daughter back.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.461
Marie...

26:53.470 --> 26:56.337
I love you, langston.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.270
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.498
It's gonna be okay.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.161
He stays unconscious,

27:21.170 --> 27:23.661
He's gonna need more care
than I can give him.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.674
Where are the wirths and yarrow?

27:30.680 --> 27:33.444
Koz:
They've just
started now.

27:33.450 --> 27:36.749
There's an injured child
in there because of you.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.583
He broke the rules.
So

27:39.590 --> 27:41.319
You disciplined him?

27:41.320 --> 27:42.856
That's right.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.589
I did.

27:44.590 --> 27:46.023
I'll handle this.

27:46.030 --> 27:49.022
You do not touch these
children unless I tell you.

27:49.030 --> 27:51.555
You do not decide
discipline here.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.030
You're not a parent.

27:56.040 --> 27:59.237
How could you know?

28:04.280 --> 28:06.339
(phone rings)

28:10.320 --> 28:12.379
(metal detector beeping)

28:31.640 --> 28:34.461
Man:
Bomb! She's got a bomb!

28:36.880 --> 28:38.472
She's wearing a bomb!

28:38.480 --> 28:39.504
Fbi! Don't move!

28:39.510 --> 28:41.307
Hands off the trigger.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.709
I got her. You go after
the other two parents.

28:43.720 --> 28:47.508
You, step back!
Secret service!
I'm secret serwce!

28:47.520 --> 28:49.249
You thinking about sharlene?

28:49.260 --> 28:50.887
Guard:
Drop it!

28:50.890 --> 28:52.482
You are, aren't you?

28:52.490 --> 28:54.321
Right now, she's all
you can think about.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.753
You know my daughter's name?
Guard: _
Step away, Sir!

28:56.760 --> 28:59.558
Finley:
Don't worry about them. For
a vest, they'll use a sniper.

29:00.270 --> 29:01.828
We won't see him,

29:01.840 --> 29:03.398
But he's there, marie.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.867
(alarm whoops)
female voice: Security breach.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.599
Sniper:
This is navajo 1.

29:06.610 --> 29:08.237
I have the shot.
I'm awaiting a green light.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.435
What the... No shot.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.670
Female _voice:
Security. ..

29:12.680 --> 29:13.908
I know you're doing this
to save sharlene.

29:13.910 --> 29:15.502
Navajo 1. I have no shot.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.172
But I know that sniper wants
to shoot you, marie.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.680
I will do my best
to stand in his way.

29:20.690 --> 29:22.681
Why would you want to do that?

29:22.690 --> 29:24.453
It's kind of my job description.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.678
I don't know why the kidnappers

29:26.690 --> 29:28.385
Want you dead, marie,
but I'm pretty sure

29:28.400 --> 29:30.755
It's not
what your daughter wants.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.694
Male voice: Classified materials
have left the building.
Congressman wirth!

29:33.700 --> 29:34.928
Congressman wirth!

29:34.940 --> 29:37.966
They are going to kill you.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.232
Congressman wirth,
I need that phone!

29:39.240 --> 29:41.105
Not yet.

29:41.110 --> 29:42.463
The phone, sir.
Please. Not just yet.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.632
Sniper:
Looking for a green light.
Help me.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.106
Sniper 2:
This is navajo 2. I'm on target.

29:47.110 --> 29:49.578
I need that phone, sir.
Please. Not just yet.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.877
Sniper:
You are a go, navajo 2.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.312
Take her out.

29:55.290 --> 29:55.984
(gunshot)

29:55.990 --> 29:57.218
(gasps)

29:57.220 --> 29:58.653
Sniper 3:
The runner is down.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.127
I repeat, the runner's down.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.223
Congressman wirth is down.

30:02.230 --> 30:03.891
The bomb's not real!

30:03.900 --> 30:05.390
The bomb's not real!

30:05.400 --> 30:07.391
Marie, where is_your husband?
(crying)

30:07.400 --> 30:10.858
What does he have to do?
Just let him go.
Please. Just let him go.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.400
Did it go?

30:13.410 --> 30:14.900
Did it go?

30:15.680 --> 30:17.636
(beep)

30:18.650 --> 30:21.972
Do I get my kid back now?

30:27.850 --> 30:29.010
(tires screeching)

30:29.020 --> 30:30.612
Are you hurt?

30:30.620 --> 30:32.417
Finley, get his phone.

30:32.430 --> 30:33.749
Guard:
Step away! Gun down!
I'm secret service.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.523
Finley, do not let them take it.

30:35.530 --> 30:37.157
That's cia property.
That's national security.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.821
_ _ Back_off.
This is a crime scene

30:38.830 --> 30:41.594
And that is part of it,
so all of this is fbi now.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.090
I need that phone

30:43.100 --> 30:46.092
And your statements.
So back away.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.429
Finley, if we don't see
what's on that phone,

30:47.440 --> 30:48.668
We're never gonna figure out

30:48.680 --> 30:50.807
What wirth sent
to the kidnappers.

30:50.810 --> 30:53.005
So let's get that phone.

30:53.010 --> 30:54.500
I'm gonna
pick that up.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.772
You want to shoot
a federal officer, go ahead.

30:56.780 --> 30:58.509
But do me a favor,
aim for this side.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.942
I'm still tender
over here.

30:59.950 --> 31:01.781
Do not touch that phone!

31:01.790 --> 31:04.918
(beep)
hand over the phone
now! Step away!

31:08.130 --> 31:09.654
What was it?

31:09.660 --> 31:11.059
Did you see it?
Video of something.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.288
U.S. Special forces.
Night vision.

31:13.300 --> 31:17.464
Dunn, it looked like
they were shooting civilians.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.299
(screaming)

31:27.310 --> 31:29.039
(gunfire)

31:36.190 --> 31:38.658
I've seen a lot of things.

31:39.830 --> 31:42.685
Never anything like that.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.396
You've been in a lot
of firefights, haven't you?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.721
Man (on screen):
Kids here. I got kids here.
I have.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.891
Well, what impresses you
about this one?

31:53.510 --> 31:57.298
The total lack of control.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.400
Yes.

32:03.220 --> 32:06.986
The people in control were
somewhere else at the time.

32:09.390 --> 32:12.450
(gunfire continues)

32:19.370 --> 32:21.861
Where's sharlene?

32:21.870 --> 32:24.589
When was the last time
you saw her?
Last meal break.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.736
Sloan's missing, too.

32:25.740 --> 32:27.139
Did they take them?

32:27.140 --> 32:28.869
Did anyone see sloan
or sharlene get taken?

32:31.540 --> 32:32.939
Is this it?

32:32.950 --> 32:34.679
Am I going home?

32:40.220 --> 32:42.780
Marie:
That voice on the phone told us
where to go, what to do.

32:42.790 --> 32:45.759
Did you see the video?
No.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.648
You were alone with it,
but you didn't watch it?
No, that's right.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.424
We did exactly as we were told.

32:50.430 --> 32:53.069
Except. . .

32:53.070 --> 32:55.493
He was supposed
to wear the vest.

32:56.940 --> 33:00.307
But he couldn't...

33:00.310 --> 33:02.665
So I did, and now he's dead.

33:04.140 --> 33:07.644
Can you tell me
what time it is... Please?

33:09.450 --> 33:11.816
It's a little after 3:00.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.618
Why?

33:14.620 --> 33:16.451
And the flash drive?

33:16.460 --> 33:18.849
It was where
he said it would be.

33:18.860 --> 33:21.852
You keep doing that--
looking at your watch.

33:21.860 --> 33:23.999
Yes.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.628
I had to wait until now
to tell you something.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.292
What?
I have to tell you...

33:29.300 --> 33:32.963
38.907...

33:32.970 --> 33:34.938
2309.

33:34.940 --> 33:37.670
77.0364641.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.376
I wrote it down
so I wouldn't forget.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.848
See?

33:44.480 --> 33:46.710
Will you excuse me
for one minute?

33:49.290 --> 33:51.383
Gps coordinates. They each got
half of the location.

33:51.390 --> 33:53.529
It's around the block from here.

33:53.530 --> 33:54.986
What do you see, finley?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.888
Look at windows,
rooftops, doonnays.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.822
Look for people standing
alone, looking down,

33:58.830 --> 34:01.025
Looking the other direction
from everyone else.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.667
Look for idling cars,
backpacks.

34:02.670 --> 34:04.661
Look for hands in pockets,
combat boots.

34:04.670 --> 34:07.104
Look for cars
at expired meters.

34:23.190 --> 34:24.817
Man:
Clear.

34:34.070 --> 34:37.164
Girls, my name is agent
susie dunn. Are you okay?

34:37.170 --> 34:38.262
Is it over?

34:38.270 --> 34:39.339
(panﬁng)

34:39.340 --> 34:40.705
Is it over?

34:40.710 --> 34:42.507
(phone ringing)

34:47.610 --> 34:50.113
(phone ringing)

34:55.460 --> 34:57.917
Amber (on phone):
My name is amber fitch.

34:57.930 --> 35:02.526
I've been selected by my captors
to read this message.

35:02.530 --> 35:04.953
That man did not have
to die today.

35:04.970 --> 35:07.768
That was the cia
who did that shooting.

35:07.770 --> 35:11.797
Congressman wirth's blood
is on the cia, not us.

35:11.810 --> 35:15.234
Amber...
This is agent susie dunn.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.798
I'm with the fbi.

35:16.810 --> 35:20.246
(click)

35:20.250 --> 35:22.844
My father's dead?

35:26.320 --> 35:29.778
(sighs)

35:31.820 --> 35:34.789
I'm not going home, am I?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.552
Go back to work.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.131
Sharlene's father is dead.

35:51.740 --> 35:55.301
My best friend's dad.

36:03.660 --> 36:06.220
You didn't know, did you?

36:08.930 --> 36:11.626
Beth ann:
My dad--

36:11.630 --> 36:13.097
What are you doing to him?

36:13.100 --> 36:14.590
When can he come back out?

36:18.100 --> 36:20.603
(grunts)

36:27.050 --> 36:29.041
Olsen :
By lea i/ing them just

36:29.050 --> 36:30.677
Around the block from the fbi,

36:30.680 --> 36:32.773
He's saying he's better than us,
smarter than us.

36:32.790 --> 36:35.042
He can come onto our street,
and we can't stop him.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.483
Man:
I have access to the
surveillance cameras on

36:37.490 --> 36:38.616
That block.
Here it is.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.621
Olsen:
Fix that.

36:40.630 --> 36:43.451
Fix it now!

36:43.460 --> 36:46.566
It's not the equipment. It's
him. Those cameras use infrared.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.891
If he's wearing infrared leds

36:48.900 --> 36:50.731
In a hat, no one
around will notice,

36:50.740 --> 36:53.459
But on camera,
it comes out like that.

36:53.470 --> 36:55.131
Amber:
My name is amber fitch.
I've been selected...

36:55.140 --> 36:56.368
We got this,
but he bounced the signal

36:56.380 --> 36:58.007
Too much to get an origin.

36:58.010 --> 37:00.478
Amber:
That man did not have
to die today.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.869
That was the cia
who did that shooting.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.316
Congressman wirth's blood
is on the cia, not us.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.788
My name is amber fitch.

37:13.660 --> 37:16.356
This side wins.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.328
You will get dinner,
you will sleep

37:18.330 --> 37:19.922
In a bed.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.160
This side loses.

37:22.170 --> 37:23.990
No dinner, and

37:24.000 --> 37:25.536
You will sleep
on the floor tonight.

37:25.540 --> 37:28.839
Now go wash up.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.308
You all stink of money.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.591
(trilling)

38:10.320 --> 38:12.413
Hold on that one.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.819
(beep)

38:13.820 --> 38:15.242
Push in on that.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.114
Identify that location.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.281
(trilling,
keyboard keys clicking)

38:19.290 --> 38:21.429
Noah: Those are onlookers
outside the pakistani embassy,

38:21.430 --> 38:23.398
Washington, d.C.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.493
What is it?
What do you see?

38:27.270 --> 38:29.090
I know him.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.898
He used to work for me.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.779
What did he do?

38:36.780 --> 38:39.203
You know, we do a lot
of business with the cia.

38:40.150 --> 38:42.209
He was our liaison.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.168
Why did he stop
working for you?

39:09.540 --> 39:11.531
Something horrible happened.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.141
How did you get in here?

39:52.150 --> 39:54.038
The guards are changing shifts.

39:54.050 --> 39:55.312
You're supposed
to leave

39:55.320 --> 39:57.356
When you see someone like this.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.588
Yeah?

39:58.590 --> 40:00.478
And why is that?

40:02.500 --> 40:04.297
Because it's ugly.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.061
But I don't
want to leave.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.958
You want to know why.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.637
I know why.

40:15.370 --> 40:17.838
You want to feel something
that's just yours.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.741
Yes...

40:20.750 --> 40:23.105
That no one
else can touch.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.371
Yes...

40:24.380 --> 40:26.439
I know what
that's like.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.079
I know what
that's like.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.938
You don't know.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.033
How could you?

41:00.550 --> 41:02.040
Finley:
That one.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.813
He was in the video
I saw at the cia.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.218
You're sure?

41:06.230 --> 41:07.879
I'm sure.

41:07.890 --> 41:09.289
He was one of the
soldiers we took out

41:09.300 --> 41:10.619
Of the pakistani
embassy.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.663
If this kidnapping
is about the cia,

41:13.670 --> 41:15.490
We don't talk on
the phone about it,

41:15.500 --> 41:17.092
We don't e-mail about it,

41:17.100 --> 41:19.739
We don't speak of it
at fbi headquarters.

41:19.740 --> 41:20.968
This is
the kind of

41:20.970 --> 41:22.904
Investigation
that ruins careers

41:22.910 --> 41:24.377
And gets people dead.

41:25.950 --> 41:28.202
So it's just you two and me.

41:35.020 --> 41:37.215
