I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT A COUPLE

13:58.489 --> 14:03.930
WHO ASKED ME TO BE
A SPERM DONOR.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.496
AND I SAID I'D DO IT.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.628
WAIT, WHAT?

14:06.671 --> 14:08.717
YEAH, I MEAN--

14:08.760 --> 14:10.240
I'M PROBABLY NEVER
GONNA HAVE KIDS

14:10.284 --> 14:12.155
SO WHY NOT DO IT NOW,
RIGHT?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.287
I'M SORRY.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.897
IF THAT IS THE REASON
YOU'RE DOING THIS,

14:14.941 --> 14:16.420
YOU DEFINITELY CANNOT DO IT.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.421
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:17.465 --> 14:19.249
ONE WEIRD WOMAN
BREAKS YOUR HEART,

14:19.293 --> 14:20.468
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE LIKE,

14:20.511 --> 14:23.514
"NO, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN EVER BE A DAD.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.690
"I CAN NEVER BE
A FATHER FIGURE TO NO ONE

14:25.734 --> 14:27.301
WITH THIS BROKEN HEART
OF MINE."

14:27.344 --> 14:28.868
LIKE, THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.957
YOU ALREADY CALL A WALLET
A BILLFOLD.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.393
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DAD, OKAY?

14:32.436 --> 14:33.742
JUST DEAL WITH IT.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.396
I ALREADY SAID I'D DO IT.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.440
OH.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.920
WELL, IF YOU ALREADY SAID

14:37.964 --> 14:39.487
THAT YOU WOULD DO
THIS LIFE-ALTERING DECISION

14:39.530 --> 14:41.184
OF BEING THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER

14:41.228 --> 14:42.490
OF SOME RANDOM KID
YOU DON'T KNOW,

14:42.533 --> 14:43.970
THEN, YEAH, I GUESS
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.754
REALLY?NO. OF COURSE NOT.

14:45.797 --> 14:46.973
YOU'RE SUCH A DUMMY.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.539
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE TIME.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.801
LET'S GO TRY TO GET
OUT OF THIS.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.368
[Mindy]
HERE'S THE DEAL.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.849
I KNOW DANNY
REALLY, REALLY WELL.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.416
WHOA, MINDY.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:55.459 --> 14:56.547
IT'S TIME TO COME CLEAN.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.246
FIRST OF ALL,
HE IS CRAZILY SWEATY.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.857
LIKE, SWEAT FAUCETS COMING OUT
OF HIS HANDS.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.381
THAT'S TRUE,
I DO HAVE SOME CLAMMY HANDS.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.688
HE IS STUBBORN, STINGY,

15:06.731 --> 15:08.951
AND HE'S SCARED
OF GAME OF THRONES.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.518
YEAH, THERE'S PARTS OF
GAMES OF THRONES

15:10.561 --> 15:12.433
THAT ARE, LIKE, KIND OF
INTERESTING AND, LIKE, VIOLENT,

15:12.476 --> 15:13.913
BUT IT'S NOT A SCARY SHOW.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.784
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT--

15:15.827 --> 15:17.220
IT'S NOT A SCARY SHOW. NOPE.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.918
ALSO, HE HAS TINY EARS,
AND HE'S A SELFISH LOVER.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.441
WAIT--WHAT?SO LET ME ASK YOU.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.225
I NEVER EVEN--DO YOU REALLY WANT...

15:22.269 --> 15:25.272
DANIEL CASTELLANO
TO BE THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER

15:25.315 --> 15:28.884
OF YOUR ANGRY, SWEATY,
EMOTIONALLY NEEDY BABY?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.320
NO.
NO.

15:30.364 --> 15:31.495
OKAY, WELL,
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU GUYS.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.367
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.239
SAM, I THINK I'M DOING IT
THIS TIME.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.501
THAT'S A PUSH-UP TO YOU?YES.

15:37.545 --> 15:38.807
THAT'S JUST AN "UP."

15:38.850 --> 15:41.201
I HATE THIS. WHY CAN'T
I JUST DO GIRL PUSH-UPS?

15:41.244 --> 15:42.593
TUCK YOUR BUTT IN.
YOUR BUTT'S TOO HIGH.OH, GOD.

15:42.637 --> 15:43.855
YOU GOT TO PUT
YOUR BUTT DOWN.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.857
I HAVE A BIG BUTT.
OKAY? JUST DEAL WITH IT.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.772
[knock on door]
HELLO, MR. KLEINFELD.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.470
YES.GOT YOUR X-RAYS BACK.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.080
OH, THANK GOD.
WHAT IS THE NEWS?

15:51.124 --> 15:52.516
WELL, YOU GOT LUCKY
FOR SUCH A FALL.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.431
SEE? THAT'S JUST A SPRAIN.
NO BREAKS.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.998
GREAT.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.087
LET'S NOT CELEBRATE TOO EARLY,
YOU GUYS.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.480
SAM, IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY,

15:59.523 --> 16:01.482
A SPRAIN CAN ACTUALLY BE WORSE
THAN A FRACTURE.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.918
BUT NOT IN THIS CASE.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.094
IN THIS CASE, IT IS
A REALLY, REALLY MINOR SPRAIN.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.487
UM--
[clears throat]

16:06.530 --> 16:07.444
DOUG, CAN I JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND PLEASE?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.055
SURE, MINDY.COOL.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.318
HOW'S IT GOING?I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.841
MARCH MADNESS IS COMING UP.MINDY, I--

16:12.884 --> 16:14.625
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE

16:14.669 --> 16:18.716
TO MAYBE JUST WRITE THE WORD
"FRACTURE" IN SAM'S FOLDER?

16:18.760 --> 16:21.458
[Doug]
I WOULD BE BREAKING
THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.938
DOUG, WE'VE ALL DONE
STUFF LIKE THIS.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.332
FOR INSTANCE, I HAVE TAKEN HOME
A Z-PAK ON OCCASION.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.681
YOU TAKE HOME Z-PAKS?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.988
I DON'T DO THAT,
BUT IT WOULD BE EASY TO DO.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.513
DR. L, HEY. YEAH.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.080
I DID SOME OF THAT INTEL
YOU ASKED ME FOR

16:34.123 --> 16:37.039
ABOUT HOW TO GET A SOLDIER
KICKED OUT OF THE ARMY.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.910
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
MORGAN, SHH.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.042
OH, RIGHT.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.043
TELL EVERYONE HE'S GAY.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.436
THAT IS NOT A THING ANYMORE.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.524
WHAT IF HE'S ONLY 16?

16:43.567 --> 16:44.612
THEN I AM GOING TO JAIL.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.353
NICE.
OKAY, LOOK.
ALL RIGHT.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.919
CAN HE BE RECOVERING
FROM POLIO,

16:47.963 --> 16:49.617
SCARLET FEVER,
OR CONSUMPTION?

16:49.660 --> 16:51.314
MORGAN,
HOW OLD IS THIS LIST?

16:51.358 --> 16:52.489
OKAY, FINE. LOOK.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.838
THERE'S ONE LAST THING
WE COULD TRY.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.406
WE CAN TAKE SOME OXYCONTIN,

16:56.450 --> 16:57.973
AND WE CAN SLIP IT
IN HIS BAG.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.279
WHAT?LISTEN.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.194
HE NEEDS THEM BECAUSE
HE WAS HIT BY A TANK.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.499
THIS SEEMS A LITTLE BIT
FARFETCHED.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.024
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.460
HEY.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.157
HEY.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.333
CUTIE.HEY, CUTIE.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.337
I'M SO SORRY.

17:14.381 --> 17:17.036
I JUST WANTED TO BUY
A COUPLE EXTRA DAYS WITH YOU.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.820
YOU YOURSELF SAID
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.082
YEAH, I KNOW.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.779
THAT'S BECAUSE
I WAS HAVING A LOT OF FUN,

17:21.823 --> 17:22.780
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL.

17:22.824 --> 17:23.825
"THOUGHT"?

17:23.868 --> 17:25.566
LOOK, MINDY.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.089
I HAVE TO GO BACK.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.656
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.962
OKAY, I WANT TO GO BACK.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.529
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY.

17:32.573 --> 17:33.748
I WANT TO GO BACK THERE.

17:33.791 --> 17:34.618
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME CRY,

17:34.662 --> 17:36.055
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.491
HOW COULD THAT
BE POSSIBLE?

17:37.534 --> 17:39.493
IT IS LITERALLY
AFGHANISTAN.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.711
THAT'S KIND
OF THE WHOLE POINT

17:40.755 --> 17:41.930
OF JOINING THE MILITARY

17:41.973 --> 17:44.585
IS TO GET INVOLVED
IN CONFLICTS THAT MATTER.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.021
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.153
OKAY?I DON'T EITHER.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.111
I JUST MET YOU.
AND YOU'RE CUTE AND FUN.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.547
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.809
AND I WANTED YOU TO STAY HERE
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH,

17:51.853 --> 17:52.984
AND WE CAN DATE.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.595
AND WE CAN GO
TO THE CENTRAL PARK ZOO,

17:54.638 --> 17:55.944
AND, LIKE,
MAKE FUN OF ANIMALS

17:55.987 --> 17:58.120
AND A GIRAFFE COMES
AND STEALS OUR ICE CREAM.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.296
[beeper vibrates]

18:00.340 --> 18:02.603
OH, GOD.
I HAVE A PROCEDURE.

18:02.646 --> 18:03.647
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN'T JUST WAIT

18:03.691 --> 18:05.127
A COUPLE DAYS
AND THEN DO IT?

18:05.171 --> 18:06.215
[mockingly]
HA HA HA.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.782
WAY TO TURN
MY WORDS AGAINST ME.

18:07.825 --> 18:12.221
WELL, WAY TO HAVE WORDS
THAT ARE VERY EASILY TURNABLE.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.702
I SHOULD GO TO MY PROCEDURE.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.878
OKAY, I'LL BE--YEAH.
[Morgan]
SAM, WAIT.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.619
CAN I DRIVE YOU
TO THE BUS STATION?

18:18.662 --> 18:21.665
AND IF THE ANSWER IS YES,
DO YOU HAVE A CAR?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.148
YOU ARE ALL OUT
OF WHACK.

18:26.192 --> 18:29.673
IF YOU CAN, TRY TO KEEP ANY
BAZOOKAS ON YOUR LEFT SHOULDER.

18:29.717 --> 18:30.848
MORGAN, LEAVE HIM ALONE.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.067
IT ACTUALLY FEELS
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.547
THANK YOU.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.852
SO, MINDY,

18:34.896 --> 18:37.725
SHE'S LIKE A REALLY GREAT
DOCTOR, ISN'T SHE?

18:37.768 --> 18:39.944
YEAH.
SHE IS REALLY GREAT.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.424
THAT MEANS
A LOT COMING FROM HIM

18:41.468 --> 18:42.556
BECAUSE HE'S VERY COMPETITIVE

18:42.599 --> 18:43.992
AND DOESN'T GIVE
A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.124
NO, I'M NOT.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.342
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR

18:46.386 --> 18:47.343
AND GIVE THIS TO HER FOR ME?

18:47.387 --> 18:48.605
I GOT TO HEAD OUT.

18:48.649 --> 18:49.606
WELL, SHE'LL BE
BACK IN A BIT.

18:49.650 --> 18:50.694
YOU CAN GIVE IT
TO HER YOURSELF.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.740
IT'S BETTER IF I GO.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.002
IT WAS REALLY NICE
MEETING YOU GUYS.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.046
YEAH.
GREAT TO MEET YOU.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.352
YEP.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.311
YEAH, IF I WANT TO EMAIL YOU,
I WOULD JUST--

18:58.354 --> 19:00.617
JUST EMAIL THE GOVERNMENT,
AND THEY'LL FIND ME.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.793
EMAIL THEGOVERNMENT?

19:02.837 --> 19:04.752
SO, LIKE, SAM@GOVERNMENT?

19:13.413 --> 19:16.111
HEY.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.202
SAM LEFT THAT FOR YOU.

19:20.246 --> 19:23.336
GOOD GUY.

19:24.598 --> 19:25.816
[Sam]
"HEY.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.949
"FIRST OF ALL,
I NEVER THANKED YOU PROPERLY

19:27.992 --> 19:29.342
"FOR THE SEX.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.692
"IT WILL GET ME THROUGH
MANY A SANDY, COLD NIGHT.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.042
"LOOK, I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T
GET TO SAY GOOD-BYE FOR REAL,

19:34.085 --> 19:35.435
"BUT ACTUALLY,
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER

19:35.478 --> 19:37.088
"BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT
HAVE STARTED CRYING,

19:37.132 --> 19:38.568
"AND THAT WOULD HAVE
MADE ME CRY,

19:38.612 --> 19:41.005
"AND NO ONE WANTS TO SEE
A GUY IN THE ARMY CRY,

19:41.049 --> 19:44.618
"BECAUSE IT'S JUST BAD
FOR OUR NATION, HONESTLY.

19:44.661 --> 19:48.056
"AFTER I SEARCHED MY BAG
FOR NARCOTICS,

19:48.099 --> 19:50.537
"I WATCHED YOUR SURGERY.
IT WAS SO COOL.

"I COULD TELL YOU WERE DOING
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

"BECAUSE PEOPLE, SHOCKINGLY,
LOVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

"SO I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND,

"WHY I HAVE TO GO BACK.

"BUT AS MEG RYAN SAID

"IN CLOSING,
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK YOU

NEXT SUMMER.

YOUR FRIEND, SAM."

20:32.231 --> 20:34.711
YOU'RE GONNA CRY?
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

20:34.755 --> 20:37.497
NO, BUT IT'S WEIRD THAT
YOUR FIRST INSTINCT

20:37.540 --> 20:41.370
WHEN A WOMAN IS CRYING
IS TO ABANDON HER.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.589
YOU KNOW,

20:42.632 --> 20:46.636
ONE WAY OF LOOKING
AT THIS WHOLE THING--

20:46.680 --> 20:49.987
DANNY, IT'S FINE.
WE HAD A GREAT DAY TOGETHER.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.251
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

20:53.687 --> 20:56.690
ALL RIGHT.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.306
YOU WANT A SNACK?

21:04.350 --> 21:06.613
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU READ ME
WHAT'S IN THE VENDING MACHINE?

21:06.656 --> 21:07.744
OKAY.

21:07.788 --> 21:11.226
WE'VE GOT SUN CHIPS,
FRITOS...

21:11.270 --> 21:12.793
APPLE, WHICH YOU
DON'T CARE ABOUT,

21:12.836 --> 21:13.750
SMARTFOOD,

21:13.794 --> 21:15.535
DORITOS,
KIT KAT.

21:15.578 --> 21:16.884
HMM.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.277
PUT A PIN IN IT.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.539
OKAY, ROW TWO.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.497
TWIZZLERS--YOU LIKE THOSE.I DO.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.544
PEANUT M&Ms.
SWEDISH FISH.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.241
GOOD.
BUT NOT FOR ALL NIGHT.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.634
HO HOS.
NO.

21:27.677 --> 21:28.983
