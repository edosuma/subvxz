WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:02.741
[Mindy]
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME

00:02.785 --> 00:04.743
WHY I LIKE ROMANTIC COMEDIES
SO MUCH.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.180
IF I HADN'T BEEN FOX BOOKS,

00:06.223 --> 00:09.705
AND YOU HADN'T BEEN
THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER,

00:09.748 --> 00:12.708
AND YOU AND I
HAD JUST MET...

00:12.751 --> 00:14.536
I KNOW.
YEAH.

00:14.579 --> 00:17.017
[Mindy]
IT'S BECAUSE EVEN UNDER
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES,

00:17.060 --> 00:19.367
THE RIGHT TWO PEOPLE
CAN END UP TOGETHER.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.195
GUYS, TODAY SOMEONE
FROM MY PAST

00:21.238 --> 00:22.761
IS TAKING ME OUT TO LUNCH.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.285
WHO, YOUR UNCLE?YES, DANNY.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.590
I'M WEARING
THIS REALLY COOL OUTFIT

00:25.634 --> 00:27.331
FOR MY UNCLE FROM DENVER.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.593
ANYWAY, OVER THE WEEKEND,

00:28.637 --> 00:30.682
I WAS ADDING SOME PHOTOS
TO FACEBOOK...

00:30.726 --> 00:33.207
TO AN ALBUM CALLED
"GONE SNACKING,"

00:33.250 --> 00:34.208
WHEN A PICTURE OF A HOT DOG

00:34.251 --> 00:36.340
WAS LIKED
BY A GUY NAMED SAM,

00:36.384 --> 00:38.603
AS IN SAM KLEINFELD.

00:38.647 --> 00:39.604
OOH!
AH!

00:39.648 --> 00:41.215
[Mindy]
WHEN I WAS 13,

00:41.258 --> 00:43.347
MY ONE DREAM IN LIFE
WAS TO GO TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.436
MY PARENTS SAID NO

00:45.480 --> 00:46.872
'CAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED
I'D GET MOLESTED,

00:46.916 --> 00:48.048
WHICH IS CRAZY,

00:48.091 --> 00:49.136
'CAUSE I WAS NOT
THAT CUTE A KID.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.572
FINALLY, THEY AGREED,

00:50.615 --> 00:53.401
BUT ONLY IF IT WAS
JEWISH SLEEPAWAY CAMP.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.055
CAMP TAKANAE.

00:55.098 --> 00:58.058
IF I WAS GOING TO BE AWAY
FROM HOME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS,

00:58.101 --> 01:00.190
MY PARENTS ONLY TRUSTED ME
IN THE GENTLE HANDS

01:00.234 --> 01:02.192
OF THE JEWS
OF THE BERKSHIRE MOUNTAINS.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.454
HI.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.456
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.545
ARE YOU EVEN JEWISH?

01:07.589 --> 01:08.938
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

01:08.981 --> 01:11.288
CAMP TAKANAE HAS BEEN OPEN
TO NON-JEWISH CAMPERS

01:11.332 --> 01:15.205
SINCE THE LANDMARK 1989 CASE
CHAN VERSUS TAKANAE.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.337
AND THAT'S WHEN I MET HIM.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.903
SURE, SHE'S JEWISH,
TONY.

01:17.947 --> 01:20.036
SHE'S JUST SEPHARDIC.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.342
NO, I'M NOT.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.995
WAIT.
WHAT IS THAT?

01:23.039 --> 01:24.301
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THE JOKE LANDED.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.390
I'M SAM.HI, I'M MINDY.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.957
DO YOU WANT TO SEE A PIECE
OF THE BERLIN WALL?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.350
CHECK THIS OUT.

01:29.393 --> 01:31.395
WHOA.
[laughs]

01:31.439 --> 01:32.831
THAT'S GONNA BE WORTH
$1 MILLION SOMEDAY.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.659
[Mindy]
I DON'T THINK
I EVER LAUGHED MORE

01:34.703 --> 01:36.444
THAN WHEN I WAS HANGING OUT
WITH SAM THAT SUMMER.

01:36.487 --> 01:39.273
[laughs]
HE SOUNDS HILARIOUS.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.622
WHAT ARE YOU
BASING THAT ON?

01:40.665 --> 01:42.058
WELL, SHE SAID
HE'S JEWISH.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.407
MORGAN, WE'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF MANHATTAN,

01:43.451 --> 01:44.626
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.454
BUT IF YOU GUYS HAD
SUCH A DEEP CONNECTION,

01:46.497 --> 01:47.803
WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY
IN TOUCH?

01:47.846 --> 01:50.066
BETSY, WE WERE 13.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.415
YOU DIDN'T EVEN EMAIL?

01:51.459 --> 01:53.156
EMAIL WAS NOT INVENTED YET.WHAT ABOUT FACEBOOK?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.897
FACEBOOK WASN'T
REALLY A THING YET.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.203
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

01:56.246 --> 01:57.291
I'M FINE. I'M YOUNG.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.292
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, OKAY?

01:58.335 --> 01:59.945
YEAH, THESE FACEBOOK
CONNECTIONS,

01:59.989 --> 02:01.121
THEY RARELY PAN OUT.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.339
I ONCE THOUGHT
I WAS GOING TO MEET

02:02.383 --> 02:03.601
A WELSH SUPERMODEL.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.603
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M HAVING A ROMANTIC DINNER

02:05.647 --> 02:07.953
WITH A MAN WITH NO TORSO.
UGH.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.868
I WAS CATFISHED
BEFORE CATFISH.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.783
WELL, I HOPE HE'S GREAT.THANKS, MORGAN.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.045
AND IT BREAKS MY HEART,

02:13.089 --> 02:14.264
SOME OF THE SLIMEBALLS
YOU'VE BEEN WITH.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.526
I'D LIKE YOU TO BE
LESS INVESTED.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.137
BUT YEAH,
IF HE IS ANYTHING

02:17.180 --> 02:19.400
LIKE THE WAY HE WAS
WHEN HE WAS 13, SURE.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.489
I CAN SEE US HAVING
A REAL RELATIONSHIP.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.925
YOU WANT TO DATE
A 13-YEAR-OLD?

02:22.968 --> 02:24.492
I DON'T WANT TO DATE
A 13-YEAR-OLD.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.146
IT COULD WORK.
YOU LIKE THE SAME MUSIC.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.670
[Sam]
HI, I'M LOOKING
FOR MINDY LAHIRI.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.628
HI.

02:30.672 --> 02:31.934
HEY, SAM.

02:31.977 --> 02:35.503
HE DOESN'T LOOK JEWISH.

02:35.546 --> 02:38.506
[upbeat music]

02:38.549 --> 02:46.557
â™ª

02:50.431 --> 02:53.173
IT IS, UM,
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.697
I WISH I COULD SEE YOU,
BUT...I'M BLIND NOW.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.133
OH, MY GOD.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.134
I'M NOT ACTUALLY BLIND.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.222
THAT'S A WEIRD JOKE TO MAKE.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.876
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT.
I'M SORRY.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.791
I WAS NERVOUS TO SEE YOU,
SO I THOUGHT I'D DO A BIT.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.227
UH, OKAY.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.228
YOU LOOK THE SAME,
HONESTLY,

03:05.272 --> 03:07.099
WHICH IS VERY NICE.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.014
HEY, ANY FRIEND OF DR. LAHIRI'S
IS A BOSS OF MINE.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.842
COOL.LET ME GRAB THIS COAT
FOR YOU.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.714
OH, YOU'RE TAKING MY COAT OFF.OH, I LOVE YOUR T-SHIRT.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.324
DID YOU GET THAT
AT URBAN OUTFITTERS?

03:14.368 --> 03:17.022
OH, NO.
I GOT IT FROM THE ARMY.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.199
THEY GIVE YOU THEM
FOR FREE WHEN YOU JOIN.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.330
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM AFGHANISTAN.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.418
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

03:21.462 --> 03:23.028
I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN
OF SEAL TEAM 6

03:23.072 --> 03:24.378
WAY BEFORE YOU GUYS
KILLED BIN LADEN.

03:24.421 --> 03:27.032
COOL.
I'M NOT IN SEAL TEAM 6.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.034
I GOT YOU.
YOU'RE NOTIN SEAL TEAM 6.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.166
I'M REALLY NOT.
I HEAR YOU.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.733
THANK YOU.YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.039
SAM, I'M DANNY.HEY.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.563
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR SERVICE.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.391
CAN SOMEONE GET THIS GUY
A SANDWICH?

03:37.434 --> 03:39.654
AND NOT A WRAP, AN ACTUAL
SANDWICH ON REAL BREAD.

03:39.697 --> 03:40.785
AWESOME.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.047
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.962
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND
WHILE I'M TAKING FIRE.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.094
I KNOW YOU WILL.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.401
YEAH.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.229
SO IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING,

03:49.272 --> 03:50.926
IT MUST BE PRETTY
CHALLENGING FOR YOU

03:50.969 --> 03:52.406
TO ACCLIMATE
TO CIVILIAN LIFE.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.016
IT WAS PRETTY WEIRD.YEAH.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.713
I GOT TO BE TOTALLY HONEST.
YEAH.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.411
THERE'S EVEN MORE SINGING
COMPETITION SHOWS NOW?

03:57.454 --> 03:59.848
THAT ACTUALLY
SPOOKED ME OUT FOR A SECOND.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.371
YOUR HAIR'S PRETTY LONG.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.372
FOR THE MILITARY, YEAH.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.808
THIS HAPPENS IN, LIKE,
TWO WEEKS.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.897
WHOA.VERY GOOD METABOLISM.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.159
[laughs]

04:07.203 --> 04:08.813
YOU'RE SO DIFFERENT, SAM,

04:08.857 --> 04:10.162
THAN HOW I REMEMBER YOU.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.947
SERIOUSLY,
YOU'RE NOT WHAT I THOUGHT.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.384
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE, LIKE,
A BORING MOM WITH THREE KIDS.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.951
YOU'D BE SHOWING ME PICTURES

04:15.994 --> 04:18.301
OF, LIKE, YOUR BABIES RIDING
YOUR DOG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.737
I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT'D BE,
YOU KNOW,

04:19.781 --> 04:21.261
YOU'RE A PRETTY DOCTOR.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.871
THANK YOU.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.481
YOU EVER GET YOUR PERIOD?

04:24.525 --> 04:26.396
THAT WAS A BIG THING
LAST TIME WE TALKED.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.397
[laughs]

04:27.441 --> 04:29.747
WE DECIDED TO TAKE
YOUR ADVICE

04:29.791 --> 04:31.140
AND USE A SPERM DONOR.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.272
FANTASTIC.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.316
WHO'S THE GUY?

04:33.360 --> 04:34.491
HE'S HANDSOME

04:34.535 --> 04:37.189
WITH THE CLASS
OF A YOUNG ROBERT DUVALL.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.801
AND THE GRAVITAS
OF AN OLD ROBERT DUVALL.

04:39.844 --> 04:40.845
[Danny]
AMAZING.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.673
DID YOU TALK
TO THIS GUY ALREADY?

04:42.717 --> 04:45.589
ACTUALLY, WE'RE DOING IT
RIGHT NOW.

04:45.633 --> 04:49.027
WAIT, YOU WANT...

04:49.071 --> 04:52.379

THANK YOU.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.383
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

04:56.426 --> 04:57.732
LIKE, GO MEET UP
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND

04:57.775 --> 04:58.733
AND MAKE OUT WITH HER?

04:58.776 --> 05:00.169
WHAT?

05:00.212 --> 05:01.605
I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT
DURING LUNCH

05:01.649 --> 05:03.215
IF YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.348
OH. THAT'S THE BEST
YOU COULD COME UP WITH?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.350
[laughs]
THAT'S LAME.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.960
YOUR BOYFRIEND MUST
ALWAYS MAKE FUN OF YOU

05:09.004 --> 05:10.919
FOR SAYING--
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.008
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HARD
TO DO THAT ORGANICALLY.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.096
[woman]
HERE YOU GO.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.315
THANK YOU.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.925
YEAH.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.144
I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.364
I HAVE SIX KIDS THOUGH.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.192
[laughs]
SHUT UP.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.280
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS,
GUYS.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.542
WE DON'T WANT
TO PRESSURE YOU,

05:25.586 --> 05:29.372
BUT YOU'D BE GIVING US
THE GREATEST GIFT.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.462
WE'D BE SO LUCKY IF OUR SON
TURNED OUT LIKE YOU.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.334
OKAY.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.379
[gasps]OKAY.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.380
I'LL DO IT.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.991
SEE, HONEY?
THAT WAS EASY.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.385
[Mindy]
OF ALL THE PLACES IN NEW YORK,

05:42.429 --> 05:43.995
YOU WANTED TO GO
TO A DRUG STORE?

05:44.039 --> 05:45.345
YEAH, I DO.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.781
THIS PLACE, THIS IS HEAVEN.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.391
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY
OF THIS STUFF IN AFGHANISTAN.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.350
HEY, IS THIS LADY SHAMPOO?

05:50.393 --> 05:51.612
OKAY.

05:51.655 --> 05:52.787
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
ACTUALLY

05:52.830 --> 05:54.266
MISS THE MOST
WHILE YOU'RE OVER THERE?

05:54.310 --> 05:55.485
THIS IS GONNA SOUND INSANE.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.747
"BOUNCY HAIR
THAT HE WILL WANT

05:56.791 --> 05:58.445
TO RUN THIS FINGERS
THROUGH"?

05:58.488 --> 06:00.969
IT'S THE WAY GIRLS SMELL.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.232
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY
SAY "HE'LL" ON IT.

06:03.275 --> 06:05.234
WELL, THIS IS THE SHAMPOO
THAT I USE.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.236

06:15.070 --> 06:17.202

WHAT'S THE SCAM ABOUT?

06:19.161 --> 06:20.423
YOU THINK YOU'RE SAVING
ALL THIS TIME,

06:20.467 --> 06:22.294
BUT YOU REALLY AREN'T.NO, YOU ARE.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.339
THERE'S A REASON
WHY NO ONE WAS IN THIS LINE,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.123
'CAUSE THEY ALL ARE SMART.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.069
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING!

06:58.113 --> 06:59.288
DON'T GIVE US
THOSE JUDGMENTAL LOOKS.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.376
WE'RE TRYING TO SELF-CHECKOUT.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.812
GO BACK TO WAITING IN LINE!

07:01.856 --> 07:04.293
OKAY, I--
THAT'S INSANE.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.642
WHAT IS THIS ROBOT DOING?
OKAY, BAIL. BAIL.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.339
[machine]
THANK YOU, MANDY LAHIRI.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.471
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SHAMPOO.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.994
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.300
I KNOW, IT'S GREAT.

07:11.343 --> 07:12.606
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD
DO NEXT WEEKEND?WHAT?

07:12.649 --> 07:14.172
WE SHOULD GO TO
THE MUMMY EXHIBIT AT THE MET.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.435
THE WALL IS REALLY LOW,

07:15.478 --> 07:16.697
SO YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TOUCH THEM,

07:16.740 --> 07:18.089
BUT YOU CAN JUST, LIKE,
GET RIGHT IN THERE.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.047
LOOK, NOBODY CHECKS.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.396
WE'LL GET CURSED
IF THAT HAPPENS.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.832
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.052
I'D ACTUALLY LIKE
TO DO THAT, BUT I CAN'T

07:24.095 --> 07:27.229
BECAUSE I'M GETTING READY
TO DEPLOY AGAIN

07:27.272 --> 07:28.360
FOR 18 MONTHS.

07:28.404 --> 07:31.363
SO YOU'RE NOT, LIKE,
BACK BACK?

07:31.407 --> 07:33.278
NO, I'M GONE, GONE.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.279
WHEN?

07:34.323 --> 07:35.890
NOT FOR A WHILE.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.413
TOMORROW.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.200
WHAT?

07:42.244 --> 07:43.201
I TOLD HIM GOOD LUCK,

07:43.245 --> 07:44.725
HAVE A NICE LIFE,

07:44.768 --> 07:46.204
AND CAME BACK TO WORK. [Morgan]
I'M SORRY.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.292
YOU CLEARED YOUR SCHEDULE

07:47.336 --> 07:49.120
TO RECONNECT
WITH THIS AWESOME GUY

07:49.164 --> 07:51.993
WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN,
WHO YOU THEN ABANDON

07:52.036 --> 07:53.081
IN THE MIDDLE
OF NEW YORK CITY?

07:53.124 --> 07:54.212
ARE YOU CRAZY?

07:54.256 --> 07:55.692
NO, I DIDN'T.
I DIDN'T ABANDON HIM.

07:55.736 --> 07:56.998
HMM.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.434
SAM IS KIND OF PERFECT.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.566
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE POSITION

07:59.609 --> 08:01.306
WHERE I'M HEARTBROKEN
OVER SOME GUY

08:01.350 --> 08:03.047
WHO'S NOT EVEN GONNA BE HERE
IN THE MORNING.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.484
THIS SOLDIER
DOESN'T FIT INTO

08:04.527 --> 08:06.094
YOUR "SEX AND THE CITY
FIND A HUSBAND" SCHEME,

08:06.137 --> 08:07.617
SO HE'S WORTHLESS
TO YOU NOW?

08:07.661 --> 08:09.053
DANNY, SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN SEEN

08:09.097 --> 08:10.054
SEX AND THE CITY.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.752
I'VE SEEN AN EPISODE.

08:11.795 --> 08:14.581
ALL FOUR OF THEM WERE
WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.234
REMIND ME TO NEVER LOSE TOUCH
WITH YOU

08:16.278 --> 08:18.454
AND RECONNECT WITH YOU
20 YEARS LATER.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.934
UGH.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.589
DID BETSY JUST TELL ME OFF?

08:22.632 --> 08:24.112
[tattoo gun buzzes]

08:24.155 --> 08:25.374
SAM.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.071
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

08:27.115 --> 08:29.204
YOU SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
GET A TATTOO,

08:29.247 --> 08:31.119
SO THIS IS
THE FOURTH TATTOO PARLOR

08:31.162 --> 08:32.860
THAT I HAVE BEEN TO
IN THE VILLAGE.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.862
I HAVE SEEN
SOME THINGS PIERCED

08:34.905 --> 08:36.994
THAT I DID NOT KNOW
WERE PIERCEABLE.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.213
YOU KNOW WHAT,

08:38.256 --> 08:39.344
YOU DON'T NEED
TO HEAR THAT RIGHT NOW.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.998
THE POINT IS, SAM,
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.348
FINDING A PERSON
YOU LIKE IS REALLY HARD.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.307
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

08:45.350 --> 08:47.570
SO WE SHOULD SPEND ALL THE TIME
YOU HAVE LEFT TOGETHER.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.354
OKAY.
YEAH, I'D LOVE TO.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.355
LET'S GO.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.792
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.315
WAIT, I'M NOT DONE
WITH YOUR TATTOO.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.535
OH, UH,
THAT'S OKAY.

08:55.578 --> 08:56.666
YOU KNOW, IT'S ACCURATE.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.581
NEXT.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.974
[Mindy]
SO WHAT ELSE DO YOU MISS
WHEN YOU'RE OVER THERE?

09:00.017 --> 09:02.977
NORMAL, EVERYDAY STUFF,
LIKE NAPPING ON THE COUCH.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.326
I MISS THAT A LOT.MM-HMM.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.154
I MISS SEX WITH A HUMAN.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.982
ALL RIGHT.YOU KNOW--
[laughs]

09:08.025 --> 09:09.200
YOU KNOW WHAT I MISS
THE MOST

09:09.244 --> 09:11.159
IS SEEING MOVIES
IN MOVIE THEATERS, HONESTLY.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.030
I SAW UPON A CRAP
SMART PHONE.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.684
YEAH?IT DIDN'T--IT WASN'T--

09:14.728 --> 09:16.730
I STILL CRIED,
BUT IT WASN'T THE SAME.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.122
YEAH.

09:18.166 --> 09:21.125
IF YOU MISS MOVIES,
I KIND OF HAVE A GREAT IDEA.

"NORA EPHRON.

09:23.127 --> 09:24.694

IS YOUR THING.

09:28.437 --> 09:29.917
YOU LOVE TOM HANKS.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.093
I LOVE TOM HANKS?
EVERYBODY LOVES TOM HANKS.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.704
DON'T PUT THAT ON ME.
HE'S AMERICA'S FAVORITE ACTOR.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.053
NO, IT'S YOUR THING.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.577
COME ON, LET'S GO IN.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.841
DINNER OR A MOVIE...

09:40.884 --> 09:42.190
[crying]

09:42.233 --> 09:44.018
FOR AS LONG
AS WE BOTH SHALL LIVE?

09:45.106 --> 09:48.152
I COULDN'T HELP BUT SEE
YOUR FAX ON THE MACHINE,

09:48.196 --> 09:49.197
AND I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

09:49.240 --> 09:50.241
THAT THAT FAX IS
FROM A DONOR CLINIC,

09:50.285 --> 09:52.156
SO I COULDN'T HELP
BUT DEDUCE--

09:52.200 --> 09:53.375
YOU CAN HELP
ALL THOSE THINGS, OKAY?

09:53.418 --> 09:55.333
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
BE A DAD! COME HERE!

10:02.602 --> 10:04.212
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP
A COUPLE IN NEED. NO BIG DEAL.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.474
MORGAN,
DANNY'S ALWAYS GOING ON

10:05.517 --> 10:07.041
ABOUT HOW HE DOESN'T
WANT KIDS,

10:07.084 --> 10:09.043
WHICH I PERSONALLY THINK
IS A SHAME.

10:09.086 --> 10:12.220
YOU KNOW, THE WORLD NEEDS MORE
ROUGH-HEWN STRIVERS LIKE YOU.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.178
SCRUMMERS AND SCRAPPERS

10:14.222 --> 10:16.572

[Betsy]
DR. CASTELLANO,
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

10:18.139 --> 10:19.662
ONE DAY, OUT OF THE BLUE,

10:19.706 --> 10:22.143
YOUR CHILD SHOWS UP
AT THE DOOR AND SAYS,

10:22.186 --> 10:23.448
"HI, I'M YOUR KID.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.102
I WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU."

10:25.146 --> 10:27.191
MORE, LIKE,
"HEY, DAD, REMEMBER ME?

10:27.235 --> 10:28.062
BANG."

10:28.105 --> 10:29.280
[all groan]

10:29.324 --> 10:30.891
OH, MY GOD, BEVERLY,
DAMN IT.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.284
I DON'T GET WHY TOM HANKS
AND MEG RYAN

10:33.328 --> 10:34.895
EVEN DO MOVIES WITHOUT
THE OTHER IN THEM.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.070
I KNOW. IT'S TRUE.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.288
HE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THE DA VINCI CODE.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.682
LIKE, HE SHOULDN'T
DO FRANCHISES ALTOGETHER.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.944
HE IS THE FRANCHISE.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.077
WELL, I MEAN,
EXCEPT FOR TOY STORY.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.382
YES.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.557
THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY
KEEP MAKING THOSE MOVIES.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.950
THOSE WERE AMAZING.MM-HMM.

10:46.994 --> 10:47.951
HOOAH.

WHERE DID YOU SERVE?

10:56.873 --> 10:57.831
[Sam]
OH, JUST ONE TOUR IN IRAQ,

10:57.874 --> 10:59.093
ONE IN AFGHANISTAN.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.616
I'M ACTUALLY HEADING BACK
OUT THERE TOMORROW.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.791

WELL, I GOT TO DO
EVERYTHING ON MY LIST.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.863
I DIDN'T GET TO GO PLAY
MINI GOLF, BUT YOU KNOW.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.691
DID YOU THINK
THE SEX WAS GOOD?

11:31.734 --> 11:32.692
I DID.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.171
REALLY?I REALLY DID.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.391
I MEANT TO ASK YOU,
WHO IS THIS LITTLE PERVERT

11:36.434 --> 11:38.262
THAT WAS WATCHING US
THE WHOLE TIME?

11:38.306 --> 11:40.308
HE'S NOT A PERVERT.
THAT'S BROWN BEAR.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.310
HE MUST HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DUDES
ROLL THROUGH THIS PIECE.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.399
WELL--A MARRIED GUY.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.361
HEY! HEY! THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.146
SO HE LIKES TO SAY,
YOU KNOW, LIKE,

11:52.189 --> 11:54.191
"HEY, MINDY, WHAT ARE
YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS?"

11:54.235 --> 11:55.758
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY?

11:55.802 --> 11:58.761
LIKE, WELL, GET MARRIED TO
A NICE GUY WHO'S IN THE ARMY.

I THINK BROWN BEAR SAYS,

12:00.502 --> 12:03.200
"WHOA, THAT IS NOT
WHAT A GUY WANTS TO HEAR

12:03.244 --> 12:04.941
RIGHT AFTER YOU HAVE SEX
WITH HIM, MINDY."

12:04.985 --> 12:06.943

OH, MAN.

12:11.295 --> 12:12.993
THIS SUCKS, SAM.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.124
WHY DOES IT SUCK?

12:14.168 --> 12:15.647
BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY FUN,

12:15.691 --> 12:16.997
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO
LEAVE TOMORROW.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.390
I KNOW.
I WISH I WAS LESS FUN.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.349
AND I WISH I DIDN'T
HAVE TO LEAVE TOMORROW.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.961
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO DO ANY,
LIKE, FUN, DATE-Y THINGS.

12:25.005 --> 12:25.962
LIKE WHAT?

12:26.006 --> 12:27.137
LIKE, GO TO THE SUPERMARKET,

12:27.181 --> 12:29.052
AND HAVE A BIG FIGHT
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.011
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.708
PRETENDING LIKE I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE CHOPSTICKS,

12:32.752 --> 12:34.231
SO YOU CAN TEACH ME.

HELP ME FIX MY AIR CONDITIONER
WHILE I HAND YOU TOOLS.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.192
I COULD DO THAT.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.846
REALLY?

12:39.889 --> 12:42.936
THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
THE WORST DVD COLLECTION

12:42.979 --> 12:44.633
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.853
SORRY THAT IT'S NOT ALL, LIKE,

12:46.896 --> 12:48.637
CADDYSHACK'SAN AMAZING FILM.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.509
I WOULD RATHER TAKE MY MCAT
AGAIN THAN WATCH CADDYSHACK.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.598
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN GO BACK THERE

12:53.642 --> 12:56.340
AND FIGHT MY HEART OUT
KNOWING AN AMERICAN THINKS THAT.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.822
I FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NOT
SEEN CADDYSHACKRECENTLY.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.345
THE PROBLEM WITHCADDYSHACK
IS THAT PEOPLE FORGET

13:01.389 --> 13:03.521
THAT CADDYSHACK
IS ABOUT THE CADDIES.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.740
[distant thud]

13:04.784 --> 13:05.741

13:05.785 --> 13:08.439
OH, MY GOD!

[Danny] HEY, WHAT'S UP?

13:14.228 --> 13:15.882
HEY.WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:15.925 --> 13:18.014
SAM WAS HELPING OUT
AROUND MY APARTMENT

13:18.058 --> 13:20.321
AND HE WAS DEFENESTRATED.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.323
YOU THREW A SOLDIER OUT
A WINDOW?

13:22.366 --> 13:23.803
WOW, ONE DAY WITH YOU,

13:23.846 --> 13:25.326
AND YOU MESSED HIM UP
WORSE THAN AL-QAEDA.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.718
HA HA HA, DANNY.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.242
I WOULD NOT JOKE
ABOUT AL-QAEDA.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.983
AND IT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO ANYBODY.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.462
HE'S FINE. HE'S JUST
A LITTLE, LIKE, BANGED UP.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.421
BUT I DO THINK
IT MIGHT MEAN

13:33.464 --> 13:35.379
THAT HE HAS TO DELAY
HIS DEPLOYMENT.

13:35.423 --> 13:36.685
YOU SOUND THRILLED.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.904
I AM.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.470
I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE
TO NURSE HIM BACK

13:39.514 --> 13:40.602
TO HEALTH FOR
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

13:40.645 --> 13:41.995
YOU KNOW,
AND THE LAST COUPLE DAYS,

13:42.038 --> 13:44.127
MAYBE WE'RE, LIKE, IN VERMONT
AT A BED AND BREAK--

13:44.171 --> 13:45.433
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE

13:45.476 --> 13:47.827
'CAUSE I WANTED
TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.480
IS IT FASHION-RELATED?
BECAUSE, DANNY,

13:49.524 --> 13:52.048
I MADE THE SICKEST LOOKBOOK
FOR YOU.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.876
WOULD YOU WEAR
A POCKET SQUARE?

13:53.920 --> 13:55.051
NO.

13:55.095 --> 13:58.446
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT A COUPLE

13:58.489 --> 14:03.930
WHO ASKED ME TO BE
A SPERM DONOR.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.496
AND I SAID I'D DO IT.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.628
WAIT, WHAT?

14:06.671 --> 14:08.717
YEAH, I MEAN--

14:08.760 --> 14:10.240
I'M PROBABLY NEVER
GONNA HAVE KIDS

14:10.284 --> 14:12.155
SO WHY NOT DO IT NOW,
RIGHT?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.287
I'M SORRY.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.897
IF THAT IS THE REASON
YOU'RE DOING THIS,

14:14.941 --> 14:16.420
YOU DEFINITELY CANNOT DO IT.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.421
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:17.465 --> 14:19.249
ONE WEIRD WOMAN
BREAKS YOUR HEART,

14:19.293 --> 14:20.468
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE LIKE,

14:20.511 --> 14:23.514
"NO, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN EVER BE A DAD.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.690
"I CAN NEVER BE
A FATHER FIGURE TO NO ONE

14:25.734 --> 14:27.301
WITH THIS BROKEN HEART
OF MINE."

14:27.344 --> 14:28.868
LIKE, THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.957
YOU ALREADY CALL A WALLET
A BILLFOLD.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.393
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DAD, OKAY?

14:32.436 --> 14:33.742
JUST DEAL WITH IT.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.396
I ALREADY SAID I'D DO IT.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.440
OH.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.920
WELL, IF YOU ALREADY SAID

14:37.964 --> 14:39.487
THAT YOU WOULD DO
THIS LIFE-ALTERING DECISION

14:39.530 --> 14:41.184
OF BEING THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER

14:41.228 --> 14:42.490
OF SOME RANDOM KID
YOU DON'T KNOW,

14:42.533 --> 14:43.970
THEN, YEAH, I GUESS
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.754
REALLY?NO. OF COURSE NOT.

14:45.797 --> 14:46.973
YOU'RE SUCH A DUMMY.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.539
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE TIME.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.801
LET'S GO TRY TO GET
OUT OF THIS.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.368
[Mindy]
HERE'S THE DEAL.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.849
I KNOW DANNY
REALLY, REALLY WELL.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.416
WHOA, MINDY.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:55.459 --> 14:56.547
IT'S TIME TO COME CLEAN.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.246
FIRST OF ALL,
HE IS CRAZILY SWEATY.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.857
LIKE, SWEAT FAUCETS COMING OUT
OF HIS HANDS.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.381
THAT'S TRUE,
I DO HAVE SOME CLAMMY HANDS.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.688
HE IS STUBBORN, STINGY,

15:06.731 --> 15:08.951
AND HE'S SCARED
OF GAME OF THRONES.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.518
YEAH, THERE'S PARTS OF
GAMES OF THRONES

15:10.561 --> 15:12.433
THAT ARE, LIKE, KIND OF
INTERESTING AND, LIKE, VIOLENT,

15:12.476 --> 15:13.913
BUT IT'S NOT A SCARY SHOW.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.784
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT--

15:15.827 --> 15:17.220
IT'S NOT A SCARY SHOW. NOPE.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.918
ALSO, HE HAS TINY EARS,
AND HE'S A SELFISH LOVER.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.441
WAIT--WHAT?SO LET ME ASK YOU.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.225
I NEVER EVEN--DO YOU REALLY WANT...

15:22.269 --> 15:25.272
DANIEL CASTELLANO
TO BE THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER

15:25.315 --> 15:28.884
OF YOUR ANGRY, SWEATY,
EMOTIONALLY NEEDY BABY?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.320
NO.
NO.

15:30.364 --> 15:31.495
OKAY, WELL,
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU GUYS.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.367
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.239
SAM, I THINK I'M DOING IT
THIS TIME.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.501
THAT'S A PUSH-UP TO YOU?YES.

15:37.545 --> 15:38.807
THAT'S JUST AN "UP."

15:38.850 --> 15:41.201
I HATE THIS. WHY CAN'T
I JUST DO GIRL PUSH-UPS?

15:41.244 --> 15:42.593
TUCK YOUR BUTT IN.
YOUR BUTT'S TOO HIGH.OH, GOD.

15:42.637 --> 15:43.855
YOU GOT TO PUT
YOUR BUTT DOWN.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.857
I HAVE A BIG BUTT.
OKAY? JUST DEAL WITH IT.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.772
[knock on door]
HELLO, MR. KLEINFELD.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.470
YES.GOT YOUR X-RAYS BACK.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.080
OH, THANK GOD.
WHAT IS THE NEWS?

15:51.124 --> 15:52.516
WELL, YOU GOT LUCKY
FOR SUCH A FALL.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.431
SEE? THAT'S JUST A SPRAIN.
NO BREAKS.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.998
GREAT.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.087
LET'S NOT CELEBRATE TOO EARLY,
YOU GUYS.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.480
SAM, IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY,

15:59.523 --> 16:01.482
A SPRAIN CAN ACTUALLY BE WORSE
THAN A FRACTURE.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.918
BUT NOT IN THIS CASE.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.094
IN THIS CASE, IT IS
A REALLY, REALLY MINOR SPRAIN.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.487
UM--
[clears throat]

16:06.530 --> 16:07.444
DOUG, CAN I JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND PLEASE?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.055
SURE, MINDY.COOL.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.318
HOW'S IT GOING?I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.841
MARCH MADNESS IS COMING UP.MINDY, I--

16:12.884 --> 16:14.625
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE

16:14.669 --> 16:18.716
TO MAYBE JUST WRITE THE WORD
"FRACTURE" IN SAM'S FOLDER?

16:18.760 --> 16:21.458
[Doug]
I WOULD BE BREAKING
THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.938
DOUG, WE'VE ALL DONE
STUFF LIKE THIS.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.332
FOR INSTANCE, I HAVE TAKEN HOME
A Z-PAK ON OCCASION.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.681
YOU TAKE HOME Z-PAKS?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.988
I DON'T DO THAT,
BUT IT WOULD BE EASY TO DO.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.513
DR. L, HEY. YEAH.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.080
I DID SOME OF THAT INTEL
YOU ASKED ME FOR

16:34.123 --> 16:37.039
ABOUT HOW TO GET A SOLDIER
KICKED OUT OF THE ARMY.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.910
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
MORGAN, SHH.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.042
OH, RIGHT.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.043
TELL EVERYONE HE'S GAY.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.436
THAT IS NOT A THING ANYMORE.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.524
WHAT IF HE'S ONLY 16?

16:43.567 --> 16:44.612
THEN I AM GOING TO JAIL.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.353
NICE.
OKAY, LOOK.
ALL RIGHT.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.919
CAN HE BE RECOVERING
FROM POLIO,

16:47.963 --> 16:49.617
SCARLET FEVER,
OR CONSUMPTION?

16:49.660 --> 16:51.314
MORGAN,
HOW OLD IS THIS LIST?

16:51.358 --> 16:52.489
OKAY, FINE. LOOK.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.838
THERE'S ONE LAST THING
WE COULD TRY.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.406
WE CAN TAKE SOME OXYCONTIN,

16:56.450 --> 16:57.973
AND WE CAN SLIP IT
IN HIS BAG.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.279
WHAT?LISTEN.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.194
HE NEEDS THEM BECAUSE
HE WAS HIT BY A TANK.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.499
THIS SEEMS A LITTLE BIT
FARFETCHED.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.024
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.460
HEY.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.157
HEY.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.333
CUTIE.HEY, CUTIE.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.337
I'M SO SORRY.

17:14.381 --> 17:17.036
I JUST WANTED TO BUY
A COUPLE EXTRA DAYS WITH YOU.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.820
YOU YOURSELF SAID
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.082
YEAH, I KNOW.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.779
THAT'S BECAUSE
I WAS HAVING A LOT OF FUN,

17:21.823 --> 17:22.780
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL.

17:22.824 --> 17:23.825
"THOUGHT"?

17:23.868 --> 17:25.566
LOOK, MINDY.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.089
I HAVE TO GO BACK.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.656
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.962
OKAY, I WANT TO GO BACK.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.529
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY.

17:32.573 --> 17:33.748
I WANT TO GO BACK THERE.

17:33.791 --> 17:34.618
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME CRY,

17:34.662 --> 17:36.055
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.491
HOW COULD THAT
BE POSSIBLE?

17:37.534 --> 17:39.493
IT IS LITERALLY
AFGHANISTAN.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.711
THAT'S KIND
OF THE WHOLE POINT

17:40.755 --> 17:41.930
OF JOINING THE MILITARY

17:41.973 --> 17:44.585
IS TO GET INVOLVED
IN CONFLICTS THAT MATTER.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.021
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.153
OKAY?I DON'T EITHER.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.111
I JUST MET YOU.
AND YOU'RE CUTE AND FUN.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.547
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.809
AND I WANTED YOU TO STAY HERE
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH,

17:51.853 --> 17:52.984
AND WE CAN DATE.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.595
AND WE CAN GO
TO THE CENTRAL PARK ZOO,

17:54.638 --> 17:55.944
AND, LIKE,
MAKE FUN OF ANIMALS

17:55.987 --> 17:58.120
AND A GIRAFFE COMES
AND STEALS OUR ICE CREAM.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.296
[beeper vibrates]

18:00.340 --> 18:02.603
OH, GOD.
I HAVE A PROCEDURE.

18:02.646 --> 18:03.647
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN'T JUST WAIT

18:03.691 --> 18:05.127
A COUPLE DAYS
AND THEN DO IT?

18:05.171 --> 18:06.215
[mockingly]
HA HA HA.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.782
WAY TO TURN
MY WORDS AGAINST ME.

18:07.825 --> 18:12.221
WELL, WAY TO HAVE WORDS
THAT ARE VERY EASILY TURNABLE.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.702
I SHOULD GO TO MY PROCEDURE.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.878
OKAY, I'LL BE--YEAH.
[Morgan]
SAM, WAIT.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.619
CAN I DRIVE YOU
TO THE BUS STATION?

18:18.662 --> 18:21.665
AND IF THE ANSWER IS YES,
DO YOU HAVE A CAR?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.148
YOU ARE ALL OUT
OF WHACK.

18:26.192 --> 18:29.673
IF YOU CAN, TRY TO KEEP ANY
BAZOOKAS ON YOUR LEFT SHOULDER.

18:29.717 --> 18:30.848
MORGAN, LEAVE HIM ALONE.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.067
IT ACTUALLY FEELS
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.547
THANK YOU.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.852
SO, MINDY,

18:34.896 --> 18:37.725
SHE'S LIKE A REALLY GREAT
DOCTOR, ISN'T SHE?

18:37.768 --> 18:39.944
YEAH.
SHE IS REALLY GREAT.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.424
THAT MEANS
A LOT COMING FROM HIM

18:41.468 --> 18:42.556
BECAUSE HE'S VERY COMPETITIVE

18:42.599 --> 18:43.992
AND DOESN'T GIVE
A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.124
NO, I'M NOT.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.342
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR

18:46.386 --> 18:47.343
AND GIVE THIS TO HER FOR ME?

18:47.387 --> 18:48.605
I GOT TO HEAD OUT.

18:48.649 --> 18:49.606
WELL, SHE'LL BE
BACK IN A BIT.

18:49.650 --> 18:50.694
YOU CAN GIVE IT
TO HER YOURSELF.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.740
IT'S BETTER IF I GO.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.002
IT WAS REALLY NICE
MEETING YOU GUYS.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.046
YEAH.
GREAT TO MEET YOU.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.352
YEP.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.311
YEAH, IF I WANT TO EMAIL YOU,
I WOULD JUST--

18:58.354 --> 19:00.617
JUST EMAIL THE GOVERNMENT,
AND THEY'LL FIND ME.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.793
EMAIL THEGOVERNMENT?

19:02.837 --> 19:04.752
SO, LIKE, SAM@GOVERNMENT?

19:13.413 --> 19:16.111
HEY.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.202
SAM LEFT THAT FOR YOU.

19:20.246 --> 19:23.336
GOOD GUY.

19:24.598 --> 19:25.816
[Sam]
"HEY.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.949
"FIRST OF ALL,
I NEVER THANKED YOU PROPERLY

19:27.992 --> 19:29.342
"FOR THE SEX.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.692
"IT WILL GET ME THROUGH
MANY A SANDY, COLD NIGHT.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.042
"LOOK, I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T
GET TO SAY GOOD-BYE FOR REAL,

19:34.085 --> 19:35.435
"BUT ACTUALLY,
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER

19:35.478 --> 19:37.088
"BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT
HAVE STARTED CRYING,

19:37.132 --> 19:38.568
"AND THAT WOULD HAVE
MADE ME CRY,

19:38.612 --> 19:41.005
"AND NO ONE WANTS TO SEE
A GUY IN THE ARMY CRY,

19:41.049 --> 19:44.618
"BECAUSE IT'S JUST BAD
FOR OUR NATION, HONESTLY.

19:44.661 --> 19:48.056
"AFTER I SEARCHED MY BAG
FOR NARCOTICS,

19:48.099 --> 19:50.537
"I WATCHED YOUR SURGERY.
IT WAS SO COOL.

19:50.580 --> 19:54.236
"I COULD TELL YOU WERE DOING
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

"IT'S THE EXACT LOOK I GET

"CLEAN DRINKING WATER

"BECAUSE PEOPLE, SHOCKINGLY,
LOVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

20:02.331 --> 20:05.160
"SO I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND,
YOU KNOW,

20:05.204 --> 20:06.596
"WHY I HAVE TO GO BACK.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.120
"I KNOW WE ONLY SPENT
A DAY TOGETHER,

"BUT AS MEG RYAN SAID
IN YOU'VE GOT MAIL,

"IN CLOSING,
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK YOU

NEXT SUMMER.

YOUR FRIEND, SAM."

20:32.231 --> 20:34.711
YOU'RE GONNA CRY?
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

20:34.755 --> 20:37.497
NO, BUT IT'S WEIRD THAT
YOUR FIRST INSTINCT

20:37.540 --> 20:41.370
WHEN A WOMAN IS CRYING
IS TO ABANDON HER.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.589
YOU KNOW,

20:42.632 --> 20:46.636
ONE WAY OF LOOKING
AT THIS WHOLE THING--

20:46.680 --> 20:49.987
DANNY, IT'S FINE.
WE HAD A GREAT DAY TOGETHER.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.251
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

20:53.687 --> 20:56.690
ALL RIGHT.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.306
YOU WANT A SNACK?

21:04.350 --> 21:06.613
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU READ ME
WHAT'S IN THE VENDING MACHINE?

21:06.656 --> 21:07.744
OKAY.

21:07.788 --> 21:11.226
WE'VE GOT SUN CHIPS,
FRITOS...

21:11.270 --> 21:12.793
APPLE, WHICH YOU
DON'T CARE ABOUT,

21:12.836 --> 21:13.750
SMARTFOOD,

21:13.794 --> 21:15.535
DORITOS,
KIT KAT.

21:15.578 --> 21:16.884
HMM.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.277
PUT A PIN IN IT.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.539
OKAY, ROW TWO.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.497
TWIZZLERS--YOU LIKE THOSE.I DO.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.544
PEANUT M&Ms.
SWEDISH FISH.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.241
GOOD.
BUT NOT FOR ALL NIGHT.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.634
