00:03.742 --> 00:05.912
Dr. L, I know you don't like
to talk during our commute.

00:06.055 --> 00:07.515
It's not that I don't like to talk.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.556
It's just that
your breath is... is very hot.

00:09.581 --> 00:12.002
Okay, this is an urgent
professional matter.

00:12.716 --> 00:15.219
I'm in love with someone who
does not love me back.

00:15.220 --> 00:17.349
- How is that professional?
- Because it's affecting me

00:17.350 --> 00:19.312
- at work?
- Okay, Morgan, a year ago,

00:19.313 --> 00:21.231
I would have told you
to follow your heart

00:21.232 --> 00:23.987
and to never give up, but,
honestly, since my divorce,

00:23.988 --> 00:27.828
I have realized that romance
is a huge waste of time.

00:27.829 --> 00:29.540
We're all gonna just
end up alone anyway.

00:29.541 --> 00:32.421
Hey, that is not the Dr. L that I know

00:32.421 --> 00:34.216
and love and sketch.

00:34.217 --> 00:35.844
Well, look, the silver lining is

00:35.845 --> 00:37.348
I haven't been with someone in a while,

00:37.349 --> 00:39.267
and I'm perfectly content.

00:39.268 --> 00:40.771
I think you're using
that word the wrong way.

00:40.772 --> 00:42.858
- "Content"?
- Yeah, "content" is,

00:42.859 --> 00:44.695
like, stuff that's in other stuff.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.616
Like in a book.
It's the table of "contents."

00:46.617 --> 00:48.370
No, that's "cahn-tent."

00:48.371 --> 00:50.081
This is "content." It's a feeling.

00:50.082 --> 00:52.420
No, that's "contempt."
That's what people feel

00:52.421 --> 00:54.089
- for me.
- This is why

00:54.090 --> 00:55.592
I don't like talking
to you in the morning.

00:55.593 --> 00:58.222
I don't... Oh, my God, that man!

00:58.223 --> 00:59.725
He's gonna jump on the tracks! Sir, sir!

00:59.726 --> 01:01.396
- Don't do it!
- Morgan, stop!

01:01.397 --> 01:03.190
No!

01:03.191 --> 01:04.735
Morgan, no!

01:04.736 --> 01:06.029
I do not consent to being saved.

01:06.030 --> 01:07.700
This is a hate crime.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.871
Brendan Deslaurier?

01:09.872 --> 01:11.123
Hi, Mindy.

"Dear hateful world,

01:21.257 --> 01:23.216

01:23.241 --> 01:25.694

01:34.045 --> 01:35.964

01:35.965 --> 01:37.593
Hey, this note sucks, dude.

01:37.594 --> 01:39.514
I actually thought it was pretty great.

01:39.515 --> 01:41.684
Um, what was it that finally
put you over the edge?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.730
Was it that you realized
you're a midwife

01:43.731 --> 01:45.317
and that's a huge scam?

01:45.318 --> 01:47.446
Hey, look, at least you're not a doula.

01:47.447 --> 01:49.115
Hey, doulas are
more important than firemen.

01:49.116 --> 01:51.078
They should be paid
more than movie stars.

01:51.079 --> 01:52.748
You think a doula should
make more than Ryan Reynolds?

01:52.749 --> 01:54.543
- Who's Ryan Reynolds?
- "Who's Ryan Reynolds"?

01:54.544 --> 01:56.714
- Yeah.
- "Van Wilder," "Deadpool,"

01:56.715 --> 01:58.259
"Just Friends"!

01:58.260 --> 02:00.221
Just put it in perspective, okay?

02:00.222 --> 02:02.393
Morgan has literally
no reason to live, okay?

02:02.394 --> 02:04.104
He doesn't make any money.

02:04.105 --> 02:05.732
He doesn't have a girlfriend. He's still

02:05.733 --> 02:07.444
- going through puberty.
- It's true.

02:07.445 --> 02:11.744
- Every day is a struggle.
- And yet, he persists.

02:11.745 --> 02:13.331
You really don't know Ryan Reynolds?

02:13.332 --> 02:15.335
- Who?
- He's married to Blake Lively!

02:15.336 --> 02:17.297
He's married to Blake Lively.
Say, "Who's Blake Lively?"

02:17.298 --> 02:18.925
- Just... I dare you to say...
- Say, "Who's Blake Lively?"

02:18.926 --> 02:20.596
Say it, go ahead.

02:20.597 --> 02:22.265
It was just a cry for help, guys.

02:22.266 --> 02:24.562
I'm depressed because
my brother's trying

02:24.563 --> 02:26.399
to kick me out of the practice
and doesn't want

02:26.400 --> 02:28.152
- to work with me anymore.
- Oh, God, that is horrible.

02:28.153 --> 02:29.739
Maybe I shouldn't have stopped you.

02:29.740 --> 02:31.326
It's just he's corporate, and he's...

02:31.327 --> 02:32.453
he doesn't even wear underwear anymore.

02:32.454 --> 02:33.955
He's got a bank account.

02:33.956 --> 02:35.207
Guys, he's hooked on the white stuff.

02:35.208 --> 02:36.878
- Cocaine?
- No, sugar.

02:36.879 --> 02:38.548
Look, hey.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.134
- We're gonna fix this.
- You are?

02:40.135 --> 02:41.804
- Yeah.
- We are? Why?

02:41.805 --> 02:43.433
Because we work in the same building,

02:43.434 --> 02:44.644
and there is no bond stronger than that.

02:44.645 --> 02:46.021
I thought we helped him

02:46.022 --> 02:47.566
by not letting him kill himself.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.612
He's a sick person. Come on, come on.

02:49.613 --> 02:51.658
Fine. It's not like I have
a job or anything I have to do.

02:51.659 --> 02:52.743
Just come on.

02:52.744 --> 02:55.081
Ooh. There you are.

02:55.082 --> 02:56.584
Oh, did you get coffee for all of us?

02:56.585 --> 02:58.463
Nope, just Tamra. We have a system.

02:58.464 --> 03:01.176
- I buy her coffee, she takes it.
- Thank you, Dr. K.

03:01.177 --> 03:04.642
Uh, can we begin, please?

03:04.643 --> 03:08.023
Yes. Ah, I'm sorry, Melville.
I guess we should start

03:08.024 --> 03:10.069
without Mindy. The elevator's broken.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.698
She probably turned around
and went home.

03:11.699 --> 03:14.077
Very well. Folks, I was alarmed to see

03:14.078 --> 03:16.123
your expenses have skyrocketed.

03:16.124 --> 03:19.463
- Rent alone is up 10%.
- Yes, well, the neighborhood

03:19.464 --> 03:20.882
has gone through the traditional

03:20.883 --> 03:22.344
gentrification cycle...

03:22.345 --> 03:23.930
from Chinese immigrants to gays

03:23.931 --> 03:25.934
to families to Chinese billionaires.

03:25.935 --> 03:28.356
Insurance reimbursements
for your services

03:28.357 --> 03:30.109
have gone down across the board.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.364
Well, I guess I can't
blame Obama anymore,

03:32.365 --> 03:34.368
so I choose to blame the media.

03:34.369 --> 03:37.039
Well, you need to find ways
of bringing in new business.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.626
Yeah, but how?

03:38.627 --> 03:41.340
We make money by women having babies,

03:41.341 --> 03:43.093
yet we're the ones
to give them birth control.

03:43.094 --> 03:45.432
It's a terrible business model.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.936
Hello, Mary. How are you?

03:47.937 --> 03:49.398
Actually, I've been meaning
to talk to you.

03:49.399 --> 03:51.109
- You work with Jody, right?
- Mm-hmm.

03:51.110 --> 03:52.905
What's his deal?

03:52.906 --> 03:55.744
Well, he's a skilled doctor,
a devoted brother,

03:55.745 --> 03:58.708
and the highest-functioning
alcoholic I've ever met.

03:58.709 --> 04:01.839
So do you think...

04:01.840 --> 04:03.801
that he would be interested in me?

04:03.802 --> 04:07.643
- Oh! Wow, you're into Jody.
- I don't know.

04:07.644 --> 04:09.855
Perhaps I could help to set you two up,

04:09.856 --> 04:11.734
like a real yenta.

04:11.735 --> 04:14.197
I've been taking a night class
in conversational Jewish.

04:14.198 --> 04:16.494
- Oh.
- Apparently, I'm a real shiksa.

04:16.495 --> 04:17.495
Oy vey.

04:17.497 --> 04:18.540
What's that?

04:22.172 --> 04:23.675
Brendan, I'm sure we can solve this.

04:23.676 --> 04:25.345
Your brother is so sweet.
In five minutes,

04:25.346 --> 04:26.973
you'll be hugging and kissing
like normal.

04:26.974 --> 04:28.643
We haven't kissed in weeks.

04:30.481 --> 04:32.191
What are you doing here, Brendan?

04:32.192 --> 04:34.446
Come to clean out your office?
Don't bother.

04:34.447 --> 04:37.201
- I already threw everything out.
- Even my African masks?

04:37.202 --> 04:39.373
Especially your African masks.

04:39.374 --> 04:41.042
Duncan! You look amazing, man.

04:41.043 --> 04:42.838
You look like a banker from the... Aah!

04:42.839 --> 04:45.050
Hey! Don't vape in his face.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.138
Hey, man, why do you got to be so rude?

04:47.139 --> 04:48.933
I had an epiphany recently
after watching

04:48.934 --> 04:50.770
a very eye-opening film.

04:50.771 --> 04:52.273
It's called "Frozen."

04:52.274 --> 04:53.985
The central message of "Frozen"

04:53.986 --> 04:55.780
is that love between siblings
conquers all...

04:55.781 --> 04:57.576
just like "Game of Thrones."

04:57.577 --> 05:00.498
No, the point of "Frozen"
is that one sibling gets

05:00.499 --> 05:02.336
all the attention, Brendan.

05:02.337 --> 05:03.671
But that's all in the past.

05:03.672 --> 05:05.634
I'm the Elsa now, bitch.

05:05.635 --> 05:07.346
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, man,

05:07.347 --> 05:09.098
that was inappropriate,
what you just did.

05:09.099 --> 05:10.936
Okay, you need to apologize
to your brother,

05:10.937 --> 05:13.148
'cause he's in a lot of pain.
Also, you need him.

05:13.149 --> 05:14.944
Who else will tolerate your nonsense?

05:14.945 --> 05:16.739
- Yeah.
- I'd prefer not to take advice

05:16.740 --> 05:18.701
from a single mom
who has frosting on her neck.

05:18.702 --> 05:20.372
How dare you? That's goat cheese.

05:20.373 --> 05:21.832
- No, no, no, no, no!
- You're a monster!

05:21.833 --> 05:23.085
- Don't do it.
- Let it go!

05:23.086 --> 05:24.630
Everybody here needs to leave.

05:24.631 --> 05:26.216
This holistic mid-whiff-ery practice

05:26.217 --> 05:27.719
is for alpha-males only.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.138
You blew it, dude.

05:29.139 --> 05:30.517
And you're wrong, by the way.

05:30.518 --> 05:32.228
The central message of "Frozen"

05:32.229 --> 05:35.025
is that reindeers are
better than people!

05:35.026 --> 05:37.071
"The whole party rose
and flung themselves on him.

05:37.072 --> 05:39.283
"'Seize him!' they cried.
'Seize the Toad

05:39.284 --> 05:41.914
who stole our motorcar.'"
Oh, hello, Anna.

05:41.915 --> 05:43.835
I was just reading Colette
her afternoon story,

05:43.836 --> 05:45.295
but "The Wind in the Willows" can wait.

05:45.296 --> 05:47.467
Sorry to interrupt, but, Jody.

05:47.468 --> 05:51.057
my friend Mary Hernandez...
much to my surprise...

05:51.058 --> 05:52.894
is interested in dating you.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.356
Dr. Hernandez?

05:54.357 --> 05:56.819
She is muy caliente, bro.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.364
Hands off, Colette. This one's mine.

05:58.365 --> 06:00.200
And I must say I'm intrigued.

06:00.201 --> 06:02.581
Please tell her that
the feeling is mutual.

06:02.582 --> 06:05.837
Hmm, I guess I'm quite the matchmaker.

06:05.838 --> 06:08.300
I can't wait to tell
my social-skills coach.

06:10.890 --> 06:12.434
Who would have thought?

06:12.435 --> 06:15.105
Me dating a woman of my generation.

06:15.106 --> 06:17.109
Hey, man, I'm happy for you.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.656
But I am really worried about Toad.

06:19.657 --> 06:21.410
Right.

06:21.411 --> 06:23.205
"'Bind him, chain him'"...

06:23.206 --> 06:25.167
That accountant's meeting

06:25.168 --> 06:27.004
has got me really worried.

06:27.005 --> 06:28.883
How did our expenses get so high?

06:28.884 --> 06:32.390
Well, did we really need
a $1,000 bread maker?

06:32.391 --> 06:35.145
Are you kidding?
If I make one loaf of bread

06:35.146 --> 06:36.941
every day for the next ten years,

06:36.942 --> 06:39.613
- we're quids in, baby.
- It's time to press pause

06:39.614 --> 06:42.786
on this Caucasian nonsense.
Sheena's in the house.

06:42.787 --> 06:45.290
Oh, Anna, this is Sheena,
Tamra's cousin.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.629
May I offer you some olive loaf?

06:47.630 --> 06:50.927
I'm not here to break bread.
I'm here to spill tea.

06:50.928 --> 06:53.599
It has come to my attention
that my Tamra's pregnant,

06:53.600 --> 06:55.645
and she's planning
on raising it by herself.

06:55.646 --> 06:57.607
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

06:57.608 --> 06:59.319
Are you sure? How did you find this out?

06:59.320 --> 07:01.490
I saw her turn down
a Bellini for brunch,

07:01.491 --> 07:03.578
and I was like, "Hold up!

07:03.579 --> 07:06.500
Wait a minute. This girl's preggo."

07:06.501 --> 07:07.878
Then she told me.

07:07.879 --> 07:10.884
Wow. This is huge.

07:10.885 --> 07:13.639
I can't believe how much
I love office gossip.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.476
She told me the father works here,

07:15.477 --> 07:18.524
so I'll be going room to room
yelling at people

07:18.525 --> 07:20.445
till I find out who!

07:20.446 --> 07:22.741
Heavens, I think I might know who it is.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.578
A while back,

07:24.579 --> 07:26.832
I was on my weekly flour run
for the bread maker.

07:26.833 --> 07:30.088
Now, midway home, with visions
of dough rising in my head,

07:30.089 --> 07:32.385
I came upon a charming movie theater,

07:32.386 --> 07:34.681
and there I saw Tamra approaching Jody.

07:34.682 --> 07:36.477
"Perfectly innocent," you might think.

07:36.478 --> 07:38.356
Wrong! They were holding hands.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.985
Then they went into the movie
theater together

07:40.986 --> 07:43.741
to watch Tyler Perry's
"A Very Madea Independence Day."

07:45.663 --> 07:47.791
And you both know
the catchphrase from that movie.

07:47.792 --> 07:49.836
"Happy Furth of Jurler, Americur"?

07:49.837 --> 07:54.053
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow, Tamra and Jody.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.848
It makes sense!

07:55.849 --> 07:57.477
Remember how he brings her
coffee every morning?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.731
- We were fools not to see it!
- Yes!

07:59.732 --> 08:02.487
Jody did this to my Tamra. Where is he?

08:02.488 --> 08:04.156
I'm just gonna make him
do the honorable thing

08:04.157 --> 08:05.952
and give her all his money

08:05.953 --> 08:08.666
and then buy me a Birkin
for my trouble. Where is he?

08:08.667 --> 08:10.252
Sheena, let us talk to him first.

08:10.253 --> 08:12.006
I think this might be better

08:12.007 --> 08:13.718
coming from coworkers
than an enraged cousin.

08:13.719 --> 08:15.888
Hmm. You better set him straight.

08:15.889 --> 08:17.851
Otherwise, I'm coming for him.

08:17.852 --> 08:20.690
And to quote
"A Very Madea Independence Day,"

08:20.691 --> 08:24.531
"You play with fireworks,
you gonna get burnt!

08:24.532 --> 08:26.159
Hallelujer!"

08:26.160 --> 08:27.495
Hmm!

08:29.542 --> 08:31.210
Morgan, are you really doing this?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.048
I have no choice. We're all Brendan has.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.592
You don't want another death
on your conscience.

08:34.594 --> 08:35.678
Okay, just leave me out of it.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.557
Lovely to see you all.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.895
And you know what? I am excited
to start my morning.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.899
- It's 2:00 p. m.
- That's right.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.360
Everyone, I have an announcement.

08:43.361 --> 08:44.863
We have hired Brendan Deslaurier

08:44.864 --> 08:46.825
to be Shulman's in-house midwife.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.871
Uh, I don't know, Morgan.
That sounds like a bad idea.

08:48.872 --> 08:50.666
But you already announced it,
so I guess that it's settled.

08:53.172 --> 08:54.674
Mindy, you can't just make

08:54.675 --> 08:56.595
decisions for the entire office...

08:56.596 --> 08:58.264
like when you decided the theme
of the Christmas party

08:58.265 --> 08:59.768
would be "Mindy through the years"?

08:59.769 --> 09:01.438
Brendan Deslaurier flies in the face

09:01.439 --> 09:03.233
of everything we stand for
in this office...

09:03.234 --> 09:05.863
Western medicine
delivered firmly and coldly.

09:05.864 --> 09:07.325
Guys, maybe some of our patients

09:07.326 --> 09:09.286
will respond to his new-age BS.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.875
And for the record, insurance
doesn't cover any of that.

09:11.876 --> 09:13.921
So, look, I solved
our money problems, too.

09:13.922 --> 09:15.466
- You're welcome.
- No way.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.844
We're gonna put a stop this, missy.

09:16.845 --> 09:18.556
You've acted very irresponsibly.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.142
Please.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.562
I hardly think you're in a position

09:21.563 --> 09:23.022
to give lectures on responsibility.

09:23.023 --> 09:24.651
Yes, maybe you should consider

09:24.652 --> 09:26.321
some of problems you've fathered.

09:26.322 --> 09:28.199
Yes, you made the office rather pregnant

09:28.200 --> 09:30.287
with your own drama.

09:30.288 --> 09:32.834
Okay, I give up.
Welcome to the practice,

09:32.835 --> 09:34.838
Brendan Deslaurier, 'cause apparently

09:34.839 --> 09:36.550
what we need around here
is another weirdo.

09:36.551 --> 09:39.221
- Jody!
- I want to thank you all

09:39.222 --> 09:41.100
for the job.
I plan on helping you all out

09:41.101 --> 09:42.520
more than you could possibly imagine.

09:42.521 --> 09:44.608
See? He's a nice man.

09:44.609 --> 09:47.363
Oh, good. We can start now...

09:47.364 --> 09:51.830
by placing these do-nots
right where they belong.

09:51.831 --> 09:53.501
My babies!

09:53.502 --> 09:55.170
This is gonna be fun.

09:55.171 --> 09:57.383
Oh, my God.

09:57.384 --> 09:58.803
What have I done?

10:03.951 --> 10:05.201
Good morning, everyone.

10:05.226 --> 10:06.787
Dr. Reed has been kind enough to let me

10:06.812 --> 10:08.959
- run today's morning meeting.
- Where are the chairs?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.951
I had them recycled. They're killing us.

10:10.976 --> 10:12.080
Chairs are the new cigarettes.

10:12.105 --> 10:14.477
This is so uncomfortable.
Who even sits like this?

10:14.502 --> 10:16.174
Really? It's called "Indian style."

10:16.199 --> 10:17.377
- Hey.
- I actually like

10:17.402 --> 10:19.113
sitting like this.
This is good for your core.

10:19.266 --> 10:21.073
- Thanks, Dr. Deslaurier.
- He's not a doctor.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.684
Wake up.

10:22.685 --> 10:24.646
I'm sorry, but Brendan threw away

10:24.647 --> 10:26.863
- all of my energy drinks.
- Let me cut to the chase.

10:26.902 --> 10:29.238
I need to take over the supply closet.

10:29.239 --> 10:30.741
I've been signing your patients up

10:30.742 --> 10:32.604
for my Herbal Materna-tea Cleanse.

10:32.629 --> 10:34.541
Hey, sorry, that's where

10:34.542 --> 10:36.628
we keep our snow cone machine, so, no.

10:36.629 --> 10:39.216
- It's not gonna happen.
- The cleanse is $300 a box.

10:39.217 --> 10:40.720
You have all the space you need.

10:40.721 --> 10:42.432
- What?
- That's what I thought.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.894
Meeting adjourned.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.565
- What?
- How did he do that?

10:46.566 --> 10:48.026
He's got to go, man.

10:48.027 --> 10:50.489
90% of my diet is sugary snacks.

10:50.490 --> 10:52.535
Yeah, my hair got tangled
in his dream catcher.

10:52.536 --> 10:54.664
- It gave me nightmares.
- Guys, I'm sorry.

10:54.665 --> 10:56.000
Brendan brings in too much money,

10:56.001 --> 10:57.837
and as you know, money talks.

10:57.838 --> 10:59.633
This is Trump's America,
and we're just living in it...

10:59.634 --> 11:01.177
And normalizing it.

11:01.178 --> 11:02.555
Help me out.

11:02.556 --> 11:04.099
Hey, wake up.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.978
Mindy, turn off "Family Guy."

11:05.979 --> 11:07.732
You've seen them all.
We have something to tell you.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.903
- Hey!
- Cousin Sheena came to

11:09.904 --> 11:11.657
the office and told us...

11:11.658 --> 11:14.203
- that Tamra's pregnant.
- Well...

11:14.204 --> 11:16.875
as Tamra's doctor, I can neither confirm

11:16.876 --> 11:18.420
nor deny that for HIPPO reasons.

11:18.421 --> 11:19.923
You mean HIPAA?

11:19.924 --> 11:21.718
Uh, I'm pretty sure it's HIPPO,

11:21.719 --> 11:23.389
because everyone's hungry-hungry

11:23.390 --> 11:25.309
- for medical secrets.
- Well, we don't need

11:25.310 --> 11:27.229
your confirmation,
because I found this book

11:27.230 --> 11:29.901
on Tamra's desk... "Family Affair:

11:29.902 --> 11:32.699
The Mary J. Blige Guide
to a No-Drama Pregnancy"!

11:32.700 --> 11:34.284
Okay, well, I won't dispute it.

11:34.285 --> 11:35.746
That is an amazing book.
It teaches you how

11:35.747 --> 11:37.124
to stop your baby from holler-ating.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.544
- Oh, cool.
- So it's true.

11:38.545 --> 11:40.255
- She really is pregnant.
- Ah.

11:40.256 --> 11:42.050
Okay, this is none of your business.

11:42.051 --> 11:45.391
It is our business
because Jody's the father.

11:45.392 --> 11:47.353
And I'm their supervisor.

11:47.354 --> 11:49.273
Wait, what? Jody's the father?

11:49.274 --> 11:51.820
I thought STDs had
left him sterile years ago.

11:51.821 --> 11:53.490
We have evidence. Tell her, Jeremy.

11:53.491 --> 11:55.327
It was the hottest day of summer.

11:55.328 --> 11:57.122
I was carrying 40 pounds of flour.

11:57.123 --> 11:58.959
No, skip that part, babe.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.880
I saw Jody and Tamra on a date together,

12:00.881 --> 12:02.550
holding hands. They must be having

12:02.551 --> 12:04.554
a clandestine affair.

12:04.555 --> 12:06.600
Okay, well, even if that's
true, Tamra is an adult woman,

12:06.601 --> 12:08.812
and if she wants
to raise a baby on her own,

12:08.813 --> 12:10.733
she can raise a baby on her own, okay?

12:10.734 --> 12:12.945
I don't have a man in my life,
and Leo is thriving.

12:12.946 --> 12:14.824
He knows the alphabet better than me.

12:14.825 --> 12:16.536
Well, Jody should at least
contribute financially.

12:16.537 --> 12:18.457
He's so rich. Didn't he just commission

12:18.458 --> 12:22.423
a portrait of himself
standing over a treasure chest?

12:22.424 --> 12:23.842
Yes, I think the painter

12:23.843 --> 12:25.554
really captured the feeling I had

12:25.555 --> 12:27.683
when I found
that treasure chest... happiness.

12:27.684 --> 12:30.104
I was supposed to be
in the painting, too,

12:30.105 --> 12:32.693
but I'm too squirmy, and
the painter asked me to leave.

12:32.694 --> 12:34.071
To me, the best art is just

12:34.072 --> 12:35.198
a woman breastfeeding in public.

12:35.199 --> 12:37.035
Jody...

12:37.036 --> 12:38.914
we know what you did,
and we are not okay with it.

12:38.915 --> 12:40.876
We know you're the father
of Tamra's child.

12:40.877 --> 12:44.049
- What?
- What? Tamra's pregnant?

12:44.050 --> 12:45.845
I never slept with Tamra.

12:45.846 --> 12:49.059
You guys, I really don't think
it's Jody. Trust me.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.063
Well, there's only
one way to find out then.

12:51.064 --> 12:54.487
To phlebotomy!

12:54.488 --> 12:56.700
One second. It seemed you wanted

12:56.701 --> 12:58.329
to say something but held back.

13:01.419 --> 13:03.296
What are you guys all doing in here?

13:03.297 --> 13:05.718
Tamra, we've heard a pretty
shocking rumor about you,

13:05.719 --> 13:07.638
and we would like you
to confirm if it's true.

13:07.639 --> 13:09.099
Okay, fine.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.728
In my "no makeup" Instagram posts,

13:10.729 --> 13:12.230
I secretly have on hella makeup.

13:12.231 --> 13:13.232
What?

13:13.233 --> 13:14.444
#NaturalBeauty?

13:14.445 --> 13:16.280
No, not that.

13:16.281 --> 13:18.660
No, we're referring to
something more... personal.

13:18.661 --> 13:20.288
Okay, Tamra, as your doctor,

13:20.289 --> 13:22.042
you do not need to tell them anything.

13:22.043 --> 13:24.171
You know what?
I'm not gonna tell them either,

13:24.172 --> 13:26.593
- because of HIPPO.
- We think Jody's the father

13:26.594 --> 13:27.970
of your baby!

13:27.971 --> 13:29.432
What? No, no, no, no, no.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.018
Dr. K didn't impregnate me. Ew.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.438
Well, don't say "ew." I'm handsome.

13:32.439 --> 13:33.815
Yeah, you can say that again.

13:33.816 --> 13:35.527
But I saw you two going on a date

13:35.528 --> 13:37.238
to that Madea movie.
You were holding hands.

13:37.239 --> 13:39.369
- Whoa, what?
- No, no, that wasn't a date.

13:39.370 --> 13:41.873
Dr. K loves Madea movies,
and when he goes

13:41.874 --> 13:44.127
to see them alone, everyone
just thinks he's a cop.

13:44.128 --> 13:46.048
I want the rest of the audience

13:46.049 --> 13:47.635
to feel comfortable laughing
at the evil white villain.

13:47.636 --> 13:49.555
Now, we were just there
enjoying the work

13:49.556 --> 13:51.559
of Georgia's own Tyler Perry
and that wonderful actress

13:51.560 --> 13:53.480
- who plays Madea.
- Yeah, and at the end

13:53.481 --> 13:55.191
of the movie, she taught us all
that the true meaning

13:55.192 --> 13:57.070
of America is going to church
with your family.

13:57.071 --> 13:59.032
Wait, so, if Jody's not the father,

13:59.033 --> 14:01.538
- then who is?
- Anna, you're such a gossip.

14:01.539 --> 14:03.165
- Get off her jock.
- It's okay, Dr. L.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.421
It's really no one's business,

14:05.422 --> 14:07.800
but since everyone's so curious,

14:07.801 --> 14:09.637
yeah, I'm pregnant.

14:09.638 --> 14:12.852
And... I used a sperm donor.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.189
Thank you. I'm sure I have many children

14:15.190 --> 14:17.026
out there somewhere,
but this is not one of them.

14:17.027 --> 14:19.615
That's wonderful.
We're so happy for you.

14:19.616 --> 14:21.369
Me too. I was hoping

14:21.370 --> 14:24.124
- for better gossip.
- Yeah, didn't we all?

14:24.125 --> 14:26.295
- You're really pregnant?
- Yeah.

14:28.843 --> 14:30.805
I'm so happy for you.

14:31.974 --> 14:33.810
Oh, you see, Colette? Don't worry.

14:33.811 --> 14:36.399
Tamra just told Morgan he's the father.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.653
No, I didn't.

14:41.242 --> 14:43.872
Am I the father?

14:43.873 --> 14:45.459
Kind of.

14:48.758 --> 14:51.179
Oh, my God!

14:56.362 --> 14:57.947
And then when I died,

14:57.972 --> 15:00.017
an angel came up to me, and he said...

15:00.197 --> 15:03.495
that Tamra and I had sired a child...

15:03.496 --> 15:05.457
and that he would be king of the world.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.419
Oh, please. You bonked your head

15:07.420 --> 15:09.407
for, like, ten seconds.
You were barely out long enough

15:09.432 --> 15:10.860
for us to go through your pockets.

15:10.885 --> 15:12.638
I'm sorry about
not telling you, Morgan...

15:12.639 --> 15:14.642
not because you have
a right to know as a man...

15:14.643 --> 15:16.354
#MyBodyMyRules...

15:16.355 --> 15:17.857
but because you're a good guy

15:17.858 --> 15:19.485
who could make a sort of okay dad.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.029
A lot of unplanned pregnancies

15:21.030 --> 15:24.495
- for an OB-GYN clinic.
- It happens!

15:24.496 --> 15:25.747
Here we go.

15:25.748 --> 15:27.334
Oh, my God.

15:29.882 --> 15:32.845
Tamra, I don't have a lot of money

15:32.846 --> 15:35.309
or a formal education

15:35.310 --> 15:37.771
or a casual education...

15:37.772 --> 15:40.360
and I have feet that smell so bad,

15:40.361 --> 15:42.196
my podiatrist quit the business.

15:42.197 --> 15:44.702
But the one thing
that I know that works...

15:44.703 --> 15:46.372
is my heart.

15:46.373 --> 15:48.292
And it beats for you
and that unborn child,

15:48.293 --> 15:50.087
and I will always love both of you.

15:51.675 --> 15:53.845
Will you marry me?

15:53.846 --> 15:56.935
Wow. That was hella heartfelt.

15:56.936 --> 15:58.605
I know, I know.

15:58.606 --> 16:00.609
But this is all happening a little fast.

16:00.610 --> 16:01.903
I need some time to think.

16:01.904 --> 16:03.823
Yes. Oh, definitely.

16:03.824 --> 16:06.244
Think about it, think about it. Yes!

16:06.245 --> 16:07.915
- In your face!
- Why?

16:07.916 --> 16:10.587
She didn't say no. I have never been

16:10.588 --> 16:13.050
more cahn-tent.

16:13.051 --> 16:14.637
Did you hear?

16:14.638 --> 16:16.432
Dr. Kimball-Kinney got Tamra pregnant.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.227
Can you even? No, you can't.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.440
Oh, no, she's gonna gain so much weight.

16:20.441 --> 16:22.486
Someone else might win
"Skinniest Nurse" this year.

16:22.487 --> 16:25.157
Wait, are you two talking
about Jody Kimball-Kinney?

16:25.158 --> 16:28.122
I'm sorry, Dr. Hernandez.
This is a private conversation

16:28.123 --> 16:31.128
spoken very loudly... but, yes.
Tell everyone.

16:33.801 --> 16:35.637
Thank you, everyone, for joining me

16:35.638 --> 16:37.808
in the courtyard.
This is a huge decision,

16:37.809 --> 16:39.645
so I want to make as a big
of a production of it

16:39.646 --> 16:41.524
- as possible.
- Can we please do this inside?

16:41.525 --> 16:43.027
My shoes are very expensive,

16:43.028 --> 16:45.114
and there is rat feces everywhere.

16:45.115 --> 16:47.327
So I talked to my family
last night about Morgan,

16:47.328 --> 16:50.417
and they all unanimously said,
"Hell, no, he's a Shrek."

16:50.418 --> 16:52.086
But they don't know him
like you guys do,

16:52.087 --> 16:53.715
so what do y'all think?

16:53.716 --> 16:55.343
I think you should make
whatever decision

16:55.344 --> 16:56.846
produces the least carbon.

16:56.847 --> 16:59.100
I say you should be with Morgan.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.687
He'll be obsessed with you forever,

17:00.688 --> 17:02.858
just like my high-school drama teacher.

17:02.859 --> 17:04.737
He still writes me letters from prison.

17:04.738 --> 17:06.699
Look, Tamra, this whole thing started

17:06.700 --> 17:08.912
because you told me you wanted
to have a kid by yourself.

17:08.913 --> 17:11.792
We all love Morgan, but you
don't have to be with him

17:11.794 --> 17:13.338
just because he offered.

17:13.339 --> 17:15.215
It's very easy for us to tell you

17:15.217 --> 17:16.551
to do the romantic thing.

17:16.553 --> 17:18.890
It is way, way harder for you

17:18.891 --> 17:21.686
to live with the consequences
of that decision.

17:21.688 --> 17:23.817
- Yeah.
- Oh!

17:23.818 --> 17:26.823
- There you all are.
- Morgan...

17:26.824 --> 17:29.829
- I don't have an answer yet.
- I know you haven't.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.999
And that's because I did not
give you the proposal

17:32.000 --> 17:34.463
that you deserve, but now...

17:34.464 --> 17:37.553
I got something special.
It's Grandmother's.

17:37.554 --> 17:39.264
And I went to her, and I said,

17:39.265 --> 17:41.686
"I have met the future
Mrs. Morgan Tookers."

17:41.687 --> 17:44.065
And she looked at me and said,

17:44.066 --> 17:45.276
"Shut up!

17:45.277 --> 17:46.655
I'm watching 'Hannity'!"

17:50.455 --> 17:55.045
Tamra Brandy Monica Webb...

17:55.046 --> 17:58.135
will you make me the happ... ah!

18:02.144 --> 18:04.147
And when I died...

18:04.148 --> 18:07.571
I was in this special place...
and you were there.

18:07.572 --> 18:10.327
Mm. - And you were there.

18:10.328 --> 18:13.708
- Oh, that's nice.
- And you were there.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.294
We were having group sex.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.797
- Come on. No.
- What? Whoa.

18:16.798 --> 18:18.384
We were. We recorded it.

18:18.385 --> 18:20.095
- Yeah, well...
- That's my Jell-o.

18:20.096 --> 18:21.349
Nope, I brought it from home.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.268
It says "Luke Presbyterian."

18:23.269 --> 18:26.859
Morgan, I tried on the ring.

18:26.860 --> 18:28.655
And I like the way it fits.

18:30.493 --> 18:33.748
But more importantly,
I like the way it feels.

18:33.749 --> 18:35.877
Does that mean you're gonna say yes?

18:35.878 --> 18:37.464
Yes.

18:37.465 --> 18:39.343
But if we're at a really cool party,

18:39.344 --> 18:41.012
I reserve the right to pretend
like I don't know you.

18:41.013 --> 18:43.518
I wouldn't have it any other way.

18:49.614 --> 18:52.201
Hello, Mary. A few days ago,

18:52.202 --> 18:54.289
a little bird told me that
you were interested

18:54.290 --> 18:56.293
in me romantically.

18:56.294 --> 18:58.088
But I haven't heard anything since.

18:58.089 --> 19:00.844
I just... I heard about you
and Tamra's baby.

19:00.845 --> 19:02.306
Oh, well, that was just a rumor.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.933
Morgan the nurse is the father.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.770
Well, I know that now,

19:05.771 --> 19:08.066
but before I knew the truth
about you and Tamra,

19:08.067 --> 19:10.070
I asked around about you.

19:10.071 --> 19:11.907
- Asked men?
- Asked women.

19:11.908 --> 19:13.411
- Oh, no.
- You've slept

19:13.412 --> 19:15.247
with half the women in this hospital,

19:15.248 --> 19:17.502
and the advice they gave me... run.

19:17.503 --> 19:19.506
Well, I have changed.

19:19.507 --> 19:21.176
I wouldn't have even wanted to date

19:21.177 --> 19:22.846
a woman your age before.

19:22.847 --> 19:25.435
I am instinctively
taking off my earrings...

19:25.436 --> 19:27.481
And you are gonna want to be gone

19:27.482 --> 19:28.983
by the time I'm done.

19:33.034 --> 19:34.662
- Aah!
- What are you doing?

19:34.663 --> 19:36.999
Uh... this is not my cheesesteak.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.795
I think it belongs to the cleaning lady.

19:38.796 --> 19:40.340
And you know what?
I'm gonna fire her right now.

19:40.341 --> 19:41.550
Okay, you know what? It's okay.

19:41.551 --> 19:43.178
You're too far gone anyway.

19:43.179 --> 19:45.934
Listen, I just came to tell you that...

19:45.935 --> 19:48.898
- I'm leaving the practice.
- Honestly, I think

19:48.899 --> 19:50.777
- that's for the best.
- Well, this is an incredibly

19:50.778 --> 19:52.614
dysfunctional and close-minded office.

19:52.615 --> 19:54.410
It represents everything that Jill Stein

19:54.411 --> 19:56.956
and Jill Soloway fought against.

19:56.957 --> 20:00.715
But before I depart, I...

20:02.300 --> 20:04.430
I want to express my gratitude.

20:04.431 --> 20:07.059
- Huh?
- Oddly, as toxic

20:07.060 --> 20:08.938
as this work situation was,

20:08.939 --> 20:11.067
it did give me the strength
to strike out on my own

20:11.068 --> 20:12.571
without my brother.

20:12.572 --> 20:14.491
Turns out, I'm not Elsa after all.

20:14.492 --> 20:16.912
- I am Moana.
- Okay, well, see you!

20:16.913 --> 20:19.000
There is something else
I wanted to discuss with you.

20:19.001 --> 20:20.712
I was pleasantly surprised

20:20.713 --> 20:23.426
by the levelheaded advice
you gave to Tamra.

20:23.427 --> 20:26.097
You've grown since we were
lovers, but at the same time,

20:26.098 --> 20:28.770
your practicality made me a little sad.

20:28.771 --> 20:32.193
The Mindy that I knew and loved
had such a romantic spirit,

20:32.194 --> 20:33.738
and I hope you don't let that die out.

20:33.739 --> 20:35.700
I did get you something.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.038
This is an Ayurvedic love crystal,

20:38.039 --> 20:40.835
and it's for keeping
the romantic spirit alive.

20:40.836 --> 20:43.173
So, even as you grow older

20:43.174 --> 20:45.010
and clearly march towards diabetes,

20:45.011 --> 20:47.974
let that be a reminder
to keep your heart open

20:47.975 --> 20:49.561
to the possibility of love,

20:49.562 --> 20:51.524
no matter how remote the chance may be.

20:51.525 --> 20:55.657
That was mildly insulting
throughout, but... thank you.

20:55.658 --> 20:58.036
And for what it's worth, I'm
glad you didn't kill yourself,

20:58.037 --> 20:59.498
which is more than I can say

20:59.499 --> 21:02.379
for 75% of the men that I've dated.

21:02.380 --> 21:05.635
Well, it didn't work out
for us in this one, but...

21:05.636 --> 21:07.556
hopefully I'll see you in the next life.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.687
Until then, I'll just say...

21:10.688 --> 21:11.981
namaste.

21:16.616 --> 21:18.494
And so, as Brendan Deslaurier left

21:18.495 --> 21:20.331
my office, presumably forever,

21:20.332 --> 21:23.504
I wondered, "Was he worth knowing?"

21:23.505 --> 21:25.925
The thing with people is, you never know

21:25.926 --> 21:27.971
who's going to make
a lasting impact on you.

21:35.028 --> 21:38.367
The most annoying person you've ever met

21:38.368 --> 21:40.705
could end up changing your life forever.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.379
Someone you've known for a long time,

21:44.404 --> 21:46.172
you could've misjudged.

21:50.110 --> 21:54.190
So, for now, I guess I'll say... yes.
