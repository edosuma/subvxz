BUT COME ON.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.877
{\an8}- WHAT THE FUCK?
- HIDE LORENZO.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.379
{\an8}- PEOPLE THINK I'M BAD WITH

07:43.462 --> 07:45.965
{\an8}SHE JUST DID IT
WITHOUT EVEN BEING--

07:46.048 --> 07:47.550
{\an8}MAYBE SHE'S DRUNK.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.593
{\an8}- SAM, YOU MISSED IT.

07:48.676 --> 07:49.051
{\an8}- I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO SEE IT.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.928
{\an8}- [laughs]

07:51.012 --> 07:52.305
{\an8}- SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WE DON'T KNOW.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.181
{\an8}- WE'RE GOING TO MESS
WITH THIS CHICK THOUGH.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.183
{\an8}- SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE'LL TOUCH ME.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.350
{\an8}- IF YOU WANT,
I CAN ARRANGE THAT.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.476
{\an8}- NO!
- EW!

07:57.560 --> 07:59.478
{\an8}- I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE ANY TITS OF HERS.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.690
{\an8}- WELL, SHE'S DEFINITELY
SHOWING HER TITS.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.900

TO LOOK AT.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.902
{\an8}- I LIKE BOOBS.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.570
{\an8}- SHE SEEMS VERY HAPPY
TO SHOW THEM...

08:07.653 --> 08:09.405
{\an8}AND HER VAJAY.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.908
{\an8}I JUST HOPE THAT SHE KEEPS
HER BOOBIES AWAY FROM ME.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.284
{\an8}I MEAN, I LIKE BOOBS,
TO LOOK AT THEM,

08:13.367 --> 08:16.579
{\an8}BUT NOT TO BE TOO CLOSE.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.997
{\an8}- WE GOTTA MEET HER
IN THE FRONT.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.457
{\an8}- [laughs] VINNY.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.000
{\an8}NOW HE'S DEFINITELY

{\an8}- ME AND PAULY JUST MET
THE FUCKING WOMAN OF OUR DREAMS.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.505
{\an8}- YO, SHE'S SO DOPE.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.299
{\an8}MET HER ON THE BOARDWALK--
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.384

{\an8}FOR A GIRL THAT GOES RUNNING
AROUND SHOWING HER TITTIES,

08:51.364 --> 08:52.615
{\an8}SHE'S NOT THAT BAD.

08:52.698 --> 08:56.285
{\an8}I MEAN, SHE'S PRETTY GROSS,
BUT NOT THAT BAD.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.536

08:59.872 --> 09:02.625
{\an8}- YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?

09:02.708 --> 09:05.795
{\an8}- OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.505

I'M GONNA CALL HER.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.340
{\an8}- THEY NEED TO REWRITE THE LAWS
OF D.T.F. AROUND THIS GIRL.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.092
{\an8}SHE'S NOT D.T.F.,

09:53.175 --> 09:54.844
{\an8}SHE'S D.T.A.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.679
{\an8}SHE'S DOWN FOR ANYTHING.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.306
{\an8}- I'M GONNA ASK HER, "YO, WERE
YOU SERIOUS ABOUT LETTING ME

09:58.389 --> 09:59.307
{\an8}BE YOUR BOYFRIEND?"

09:59.390 --> 10:01.058
{\an8}- WOULD YOU BRING
HER HOME TO DONNA?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.768
{\an8}- YEAH.
- YEAH?

10:02.852 --> 10:07.356
{\an8}[laughter]
- MY MOM WOULD FUCKING FLIP OUT.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.317
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S A BIG THING.
- MEETING THE MOM?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.068
{\an8}- PAULA MET MY MOM.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.361
{\an8}- YEAH?
- WHAT?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.904
{\an8}- THAT'S FUCKING OFFICIAL,
BRO.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.656
{\an8}- I THINK SHE'S GOT
MY MOM'S NUMBER, I THINK.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.283
{\an8}- YEAH, SO SHE KNOWS YOUR MOM.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.409
{\an8}SHE DIDN'T MEET YOUR MOM.
- YEAH.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.368
{\an8}- NO WONDER SHE THINKS
YOU GUYS ARE TOGETHER.

10:19.452 --> 10:23.039
{\an8}- I HAVE A LITTLE CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.290
{\an8}- YOU JERKED OFF!

10:24.373 --> 10:26.417
{\an8}- YOU JERKED.
- YOU JERKED IT.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.752
{\an8}- I DIDN'T JERK IT.
- OH.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.045
{\an8}OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR CONFESSION?

10:29.128 --> 10:33.466
{\an8}- HE GOT A GIRLFRIEND.
- I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.759
{\an8}BUT--
- PREGNANT. HE'S PREGNANT!

10:34.842 --> 10:36.052
{\an8}I KNEW IT.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.055
{\an8}I'M SO HAPPY.
- I'M NOT WITH ANYBODY, OKAY?

10:39.138 --> 10:42.892
{\an8}I JUST--BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE,
ALL RIGHT, I MET SOMEBODY.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.393
{\an8}- IS THAT WHY YOU'RE CELIBATE?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.063
{\an8}all: OH!
- THAT'S WHY HE'S CELIBATE!

10:47.146 --> 10:48.564
{\an8}- FUCKING SHIT.
- WOW.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.691
{\an8}- BUDDY!
- WHAT THE HELL?

10:50.775 --> 10:51.859
{\an8}VINNY'S KIND OF CHEATING
ON PAULY RIGHT NOW.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.694
{\an8}- I'M THE ONLY SINGLE PERSON
IN THE HOUSE!

10:53.778 --> 10:56.072
{\an8}I'M THE ONLY SINGLE PERSON
IN THE HOUSE!

10:56.155 --> 10:57.615
{\an8}- SHUT UP!
- LET HIM SAY IT.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.241
{\an8}- HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.576
{\an8}- LET HIM SAY IT.
- I'M SINGLE.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.078
{\an8}I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:02.161 --> 11:03.913
{\an8}BUT THIS GIRL IS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.289
{\an8}SO I TOLD MYSELF,
I'M LIKE,

11:05.373 --> 11:07.041
{\an8}"I'M NOT GONNA--
I DON'T WANNA BE TIED DOWN,

{\an8}"BUT I'M ONLY GONNA HAVE SEX
WITH SOMEBODY

11:09.126 --> 11:11.295

11:11.379 --> 11:12.755
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:12.838 --> 11:14.715
{\an8}- THE FACT THAT VINNY DOESN'T
WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH SLUTS

11:14.799 --> 11:16.884
{\an8}BECAUSE HE'S THINKING
ABOUT SOMEONE AT HOME,

11:16.967 --> 11:18.761
{\an8}THAT'S SO CUTE, AND IT'S LIKE
VINNY'S GROWING UP.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.139
{\an8}AND I'M JUST SO PROUD
THAT, YOU KNOW,

11:22.223 --> 11:23.724
{\an8}HE'S NOT, LIKE,
A MAN-WHORE ANYMORE.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.394
{\an8}- SO HE'S ALLOWED
TO JERK OFF.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.937
{\an8}- I CAN JERK OFF!

11:28.020 --> 11:29.438
{\an8}- LET HIM JERK OFF!
- YES!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.232
{\an8}- HE'S ALLOWED
TO JERK OFF.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.441
{\an8}- YO, WHY'S HE GOT A PICTURE
OF ME IN HIS POCKET?

11:32.525 --> 11:36.445
{\an8}- I THINK HE'S ALLOWED.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.572
{\an8}- WHERE'S ROGER, DUDE?
- I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.991
{\an8}- HE'S ONLY
AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES LATE.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.327

SURPRISE BIRTHDAY EVER.

{\an8}- WHOO!

21:20.112 --> 21:22.239
{\an8}IT'S TYPICAL MEATBALL.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.366
{\an8}ALL I SEE IS ASS IN MY FACE,
AND I'M LIKE,

21:24.449 --> 21:24.866
{\an8}"YOU GO, GIRL."

21:24.950 --> 21:27.077
{\an8}- [screams]

21:41.883 --> 21:43.927
{\an8}HELLO?
- HELLO.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.638
{\an8}- YOU GUYS READY?
- LET ME GET RON.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.479
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT PRINT
YOU WOULD LIKE ON YOUR SHIRTS?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.565
{\an8}- YEAH, I WANTED THE PINK.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.567
{\an8}- COULD WE GET A BREAK
FOR LUNCH OR NO?

21:58.650 --> 22:01.570
{\an8}OR WE DON'T--YOU DON'T LET
YOUR EMPLOYEES EAT?

22:01.653 --> 22:02.571
{\an8}- YEAH, WELL, YOU HAVE LUNCH
AFTER YOUR SHIFT.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.323
{\an8}- I'M GONNA CALL
THE LABOR BOARD ON YOU.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.242
{\an8}- [chuckles]
- OKAY?

22:07.325 --> 22:08.076
{\an8}I WAS NOT--
HOLY MOLY.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.078
{\an8}ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SNOOKS?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.122
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.457
{\an8}- YOU NEED SOME FOOD?
- I'M FINE.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.125
{\an8}CAN YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?
- OF COURSE.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.418
{\an8}[chuckles]
OF COURSE.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.003
{\an8}- I'M JUST FEELING, LIKE, ICKY,

22:18.086 --> 22:19.588

RIGHT NOW...

22:19.671 --> 22:20.797
{\an8}[sighs]

22:20.881 --> 22:22.340
{\an8}AND EVERY TIME
HE SAYS SOMETHING TO ME,

22:22.424 --> 22:23.675
{\an8}I'M LIKE,
"YOU'RE SO IRRITATING."

22:23.759 --> 22:24.634
{\an8}- DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
YOU OKAY?

22:24.718 --> 22:26.803
{\an8}- MIKE, I'M FINE.
STOP ASKING.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.221
{\an8}- I'M JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.
THAT'S ALL.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.097
{\an8}I'M JUST CONCERNED.
- OKAY, BUT WE'RE NOT FRIENDS,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.349
{\an8}SO JUST STOP.
- OH, SHIT.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.934
{\an8}IT'S LIKE THAT.
ALL RIGHT.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.312
{\an8}IF YOU WANNA BE LIKE THAT, YOU
CAN BE LIKE THAT ALL YOU WANT.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.105
{\an8}- IT IS LIKE THAT,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.607
{\an8}LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.776
{\an8}- I'M JUST TRYING TO JUST
BE NICE TO YOU, THAT'S ALL.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.069
{\an8}THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.153
{\an8}- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.446
{\an8}- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU'RE NO SAINT EITHER.

22:44.529 --> 22:48.575
{\an8}AND, LIKE, WE HAD
A RELATIONSHIP TOO, ALL RIGHT?

22:48.658 --> 22:50.327
{\an8}UM, DIFFERENT KINDS
OF RELATIONSHIPS,

22:50.410 --> 22:52.412
{\an8}BUT, UM, ARE YOU GONNA BE
THAT COLD?

22:52.496 --> 22:55.373
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T ALWAYS
HATE EACH OTHER.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.500
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.376
{\an8}- I KNOW,
BUT WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.920
{\an8}- SO YOU'RE GONNA HATE ME
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

23:00.003 --> 23:01.379
{\an8}- I NEVER SAID I HATE YOU.
I DON'T HATE YOU.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.007
{\an8}I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.511
{\an8}- FOREVER?
REALLY?

23:07.594 --> 23:11.181
{\an8}- YEAH.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.474
{\an8}- IS THAT WHAT YOU
REALLY WANT TO DO?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.810
{\an8}ARE YOU THAT MEAN?
- I WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.394
{\an8}- I WAS THERE FOR YOU TOO
FROM TIME TO TIME.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.312
{\an8}- I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE
HOUSE THAT ACTUALLY LIKED YOU.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.772
{\an8}- I WAS THERE FOR YOU TOO.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.273
{\an8}- AND THEN YOU FUCKING TRIED
TO FUCK WITH ME AND JIONNI...

23:20.357 --> 23:21.566
{\an8}- NO, I DIDN'T.
I DIDN'T.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.567
{\an8}- KNOWING THAT, LIKE,
I LOVED HIM,

23:22.651 --> 23:23.985
{\an8}AND THEN YOU MADE SHIT UP.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.278
{\an8}LIKE, IT'S ANNOYING.
- BUT THINGS ARE GOOD RIGHT NOW.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.780
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- IT'S NOT GOOD.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.532
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE HEALTHY
MEANS THAT I'M OKAY WITH IT?

23:28.615 --> 23:30.492
{\an8}JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE HEALTHY,
I'M SUPPOSED TO FORGIVE YOU?

23:30.575 --> 23:31.660
{\an8}- LIFE MOVES ON.
- NO.

{\an8}- YOU DON'T HOLD GRUDGES
IN LIFE.

23:33.411 --> 23:34.579
{\an8}- MIKE, IT'S NOT GRUDGES.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.039
{\an8}- SO THIS IS HOW YOU JUST
WANNA GO ON FOREVER?

23:36.123 --> 23:38.542
{\an8}- I'M SORRY.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.002
{\an8}- OKAY.

HE SENDS RON ONE RED ROSE,

{\an8}- WHAT?
- "HAVE SEX WITH ME, PLEASE."

35:57.864 --> 36:00.283
{\an8}- THAT'S, LIKE, THE THIRD TIME

THE ANGRY LOOK NOW?

36:05.746 --> 36:07.832
{\an8}- LIKE, IF ANYBODY FUCKS
WITH THESE KIDS,

{\an8}I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

36:10.293 --> 36:10.918
{\an8}WHAT DO I DO, BE A PRICK?
NO.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.212
{\an8}I TOLD HIM TO EAT A DICK.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.798
{\an8}I WANT TO DO IT WITH PEOPLE

36:15.882 --> 36:17.049
{\an8}WHAT UP, SON?
- YOU TOLD ME TO GO--

36:17.133 --> 36:19.510
{\an8}- YEAH, I TOLD YOU TO GO
TAKE A WALK.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.803
{\an8}- WHY?

36:20.887 --> 36:22.805
{\an8}- BECAUSE YOU WERE BOTHERING
MY FRIEND.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.974
{\an8}- YOUR FRIEND AND I WENT
TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER.

36:25.057 --> 36:27.018
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE, THOUGH.
HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.979
{\an8}- HUH?

36:33.524 --> 36:34.442
{\an8}I WAS TELLING YOU
TO TAKE A WALK

36:34.525 --> 36:36.903
{\an8}BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BOTHER HIM.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.946
{\an8}HE ASKED ME FOUR TIMES
TO ASK YOU TO TAKE A WALK.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.948
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- OKAY.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.950
{\an8}HOLD MY WATER?

36:46.287 --> 36:47.788
{\an8}I WOULD KICK YOUR FUCKING ASS.

36:47.872 --> 36:48.706

{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.962
