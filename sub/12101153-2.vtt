00:01.392 --> 00:02.698
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.352
I don't want to kill any more.

00:04.395 --> 00:07.268
Be my partner. In return,
I promise I'll protect you.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.487
How could I not love you?

00:09.531 --> 00:12.882
-You sad, silly woman.
-I told you your obsession
with the Kryptonians

00:12.925 --> 00:15.319
-would end like this. <i>
The program
I was developing</i>

00:15.363 --> 00:17.017
was supposed to
expand the human mind.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.453
But I think Lex reworked it.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.200
Kara, no!

00:26.243 --> 00:28.202
Without the coordinates
of where he sent her,

00:28.245 --> 00:30.378
she could be anywhere
in the Phantom Zone.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.728
Kara is not dead.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.034
<i>We are bringing her home.</i>

01:04.368 --> 01:05.456
Keys...

01:07.023 --> 01:08.416
Thank you.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.249
This is going to
suck for you.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.512
No pun intended.

01:28.914 --> 01:29.828
Boo.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.657
Keep dreaming, Dracula.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.237
Got you.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.761
-Please!

01:49.805 --> 01:52.808
I'm sorry.
I wasn't going to hurt anyone.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.505
I'm not really a vampire.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.551
We know. Your name is Silas.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.901
-You're an alien.
-From Transilvane, to be exact.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.424
Which is apparently
a real planet.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.644
You're where vampire stories
come from.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.777
Great. Glad to see
you've done your research.

02:05.821 --> 02:10.042
But you're under-emphasizing
one tiny, important detail.

02:10.086 --> 02:13.655
They're just stories.
I rob blood banks
so I don't have to hurt people.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.744
We're not interested
in the robbery.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.441
-We'll let you go...

02:17.485 --> 02:19.922
...if you help us.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.663
Help you with what?

02:21.706 --> 02:24.796
We want you to help us
break into
the Phantom Zone.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.668
Why in the hell
would you want
to do that?

02:39.811 --> 02:43.163
No, no, no, not again!

02:54.261 --> 02:57.438
My husband
was falsely accused of theft,
and sentenced

02:57.481 --> 02:58.874
to six months
in the Phantom Zone.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.093
They took Owen from me.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.835
It was so unfair.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.446
I had to get him back.

03:05.489 --> 03:08.231
But they caught you
attempting to break him out.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.059
How do you guys
know all this?

03:10.102 --> 03:13.236
My brother was in
the Phantom Zone.
He'd heard about you.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.933
We cross-referenced
what he told us

03:14.977 --> 03:16.892
-with your Fort Rozz file.
-You're the only person

03:16.935 --> 03:19.764
to ever break into
the Phantom Zone.

03:19.808 --> 03:23.072
-We need you to teach us how.
-You must understand,
I failed.

03:23.115 --> 03:24.508
And you will fail, too.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.380
I'm certain I can replicate
your technology.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.903
The tech is the easy part.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.124
It's the Phantoms
you have to face.

03:32.168 --> 03:35.345
People talk about the Zone
as a place where
time does not pass,

03:36.781 --> 03:38.392
but that isn't
what makes it terrible.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.960
It's the creatures
that give it its name.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.356
They feed on your fear
by making you live it.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.750
They're like shadow spores
that creep inside you

03:48.793 --> 03:50.491
and infect everything
good and right

03:50.534 --> 03:52.623
and then turn it
against the host.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.278
Eventually, you forget
that the Phantoms
are doing it to you at all.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.413
Your nightmare
becomes your reality.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.547
That's when you go insane.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.550
Just like my husband did.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.641
I'm sorry
that happened to you.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.252
But right now
you have the chance

04:12.295 --> 04:14.297
to help us save
someone that we love.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.342
Supergirl is there.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.606
We're trusting you
with this information

04:18.649 --> 04:21.086
because you're the only one
who can help.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.045
And we think
you're the kind of guy
who would.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.133
Prove us right.

04:24.916 --> 04:25.743
Help us.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.971
Okay, I need a pen.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.102
Good man.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.633
911 from Andrea.
I have to get back to CatCo.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.508
Silas will keep us
from being stuck
in the Phantom Zone,

04:51.552 --> 04:54.772
but we're still nowhere
on Supergirl's location.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.775
Once we're inside,
you'll need to divine
where she is

04:57.819 --> 05:00.735
and then lead us there.
And that will be no easy feat

05:00.778 --> 05:02.563
with Phantoms circling.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.868
So, you'll need to train.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.524
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.834
I want to talk to you
about power.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.663
Specifically,
the power of the press.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.666
It's the trial of the century

05:18.709 --> 05:20.407
and CatCo needs to be

05:20.450 --> 05:24.411
the culture's one-stop shop
for all things Lex Luthor.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.326
The trial hasn't even
begun yet.

05:26.369 --> 05:29.851
Well, we pre-write obituaries
for heads of state, don't we?

05:29.894 --> 05:31.548
This should be no different.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.376
We all know
he's getting convicted.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.770
We might as well
just get a jump on it.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.815
Well, nice of you to join us,
Ms. Nal.

05:37.859 --> 05:41.253
I'm sorry.
I was donating blood.

05:41.297 --> 05:44.387
Oh, how heroic of you.

05:44.431 --> 05:48.217
Obsidian North
died for Lex Luthor's sins.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.481
Now I want our smart,
splashy coverage

05:51.525 --> 05:54.397
to bury him six feet under.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.094
So, assignments.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.967
Nia, with Kara
still out of town
with Cat Grant,

05:59.010 --> 06:01.578
I'm going to need you down
at the courthouse.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.102
The judge, the jurors,
the witnesses,

06:04.146 --> 06:06.540
do literally whatever it takes
to get interviews.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.368
I will pay your bail
if it comes to that.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.370
-I'm sorry. Me?
-Yes.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.588
And William, of course.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.460
But we won't be able
to get in.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.418
The courthouse is on lockdown
due to threats against Luthor.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.725
I mean, they're even keeping
a jury off-site
to protect them.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.727
Well, the two of you
are sharks.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.990
You'll find a way to get in.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.600
Plus, if you run into trouble,

06:23.644 --> 06:25.428
I'm sure Supergirl
will swoop in to protect you.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.386
She always does.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.701
I thought visitors were
forbidden in this wing.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.312
The Luthor name
still commands respect...

06:41.313 --> 06:44.055
and the occasional favor.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.535
Ah, favors.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.929
Is that how you secured me
that plea deal?

06:47.972 --> 06:52.499
Admit to conspiracy
and manslaughter,
and go away for... Ah, ah.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.718
Go away for 25 years.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.460
I'm sure your lawyer
advised you to accept it.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.594
He did.
Which is why I fired him.

07:00.637 --> 07:03.292
The case against you
is ironclad.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.947
The Tessmacher girl's testimony
will be damning.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.731
And every day
you spend fruitlessly

07:07.775 --> 07:10.517
shaking your fist at the sky
is another day

07:10.560 --> 07:13.128
the Luthor name
gets dragged through the mud.

07:13.171 --> 07:16.610
Mother, it almost feels
as if you care more
about the family name

07:16.653 --> 07:18.612
than freeing your son
from bondage.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.788
I do.

07:20.831 --> 07:25.270
Our family has always
achieved selfish aims
by appearing selfless.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.317
If you take the stand
and make a mockery of yourself

07:28.360 --> 07:30.493
in the face
of insurmountable evidence,

07:30.537 --> 07:33.365
the world will see us
for what we really are.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.150
Do you really have
so little faith in me

07:35.193 --> 07:38.893
that you think I should agree
to rot in prison?

07:38.936 --> 07:42.244
I will remind you,
I have been in prison before.

07:42.287 --> 07:44.855
I have been shot and killed
and risen from the dead before,

07:44.899 --> 07:46.857
and I will not be
subjugated again.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.818
You should know,
I always have a plan.

07:50.861 --> 07:53.560
Yeah, boss. Kablooey!

07:53.603 --> 07:56.258
A legal plan,
you imbecile.

07:59.435 --> 08:02.220
Well, let's hope this plan
is better than the last.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.205
Calm down.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.336
There are no Phantoms here.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.078
Who are you?

08:34.122 --> 08:38.735
As if you don't know.
You bear the glyph
of my house.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.956
So you must be
some sort of mirage,
another figment

08:41.999 --> 08:44.393
of my own tortured mind.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.307
Your house?

08:47.048 --> 08:48.528
This is the glyph
of the House of El.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.888
Father?

09:02.193 --> 09:03.281
Kara?

09:09.636 --> 09:12.900
My daughter alive,
my wife alive...

09:16.120 --> 09:18.253
it's more than I ever
dared hope for.

09:18.296 --> 09:21.865
Argo survived,
because of your sacrifice.

09:24.912 --> 09:28.393
All this time I thought
I'd lost you forever.

09:28.437 --> 09:32.310
When I chose
to stay on Krypton
to activate Argo's shields,

09:32.354 --> 09:34.574
I knew there was no way
I'd get off the planet in time.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.317
Sending myself here
was a last-ditch attempt
to save my life.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.582
A terrible mistake.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.629
There are things
worse than death.

09:48.762 --> 09:51.373
And to think
you were here, too,

09:51.416 --> 09:53.157
languishing,
your pod trapped.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.595
Oh, this place
is nothing like I remember.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.728
-It's worse.
-Indeed.

09:58.772 --> 10:01.209
From the safety of your pod,
you never faced the Phantoms.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.084
They got to you,
didn't they?

10:11.436 --> 10:12.481
What did you see?

10:16.006 --> 10:21.533
I was in a cavern, a fortress
of one of my enemies.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.014
She was dead...

10:27.017 --> 10:29.890
but so was
everyone I ever loved,

10:29.933 --> 10:33.371
cut down while they were trying
to save the world,

10:33.415 --> 10:39.073
and I just stood there
among their bodies...

10:41.162 --> 10:43.425
horrified.

10:43.468 --> 10:47.777
I couldn't save them.
I couldn't wake up.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.740
I wanted to die there
with them.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.700
But I couldn't do that, either.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.703
A terrible vision.

11:00.747 --> 11:01.661
Not a vision.

11:04.054 --> 11:04.925
A memory.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.712
One that I thought
had finally stopped
haunting me.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.933
But it was crystal clear.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.891
It felt like
it would never end.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.677
That's exactly
what will happen,
if you resist the Phantoms.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.592
You were a hero...

11:22.072 --> 11:24.727
and you didn't deserve this.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.512
But it's gonna be okay now.
We're going to get out.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.645
"Get out"?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.865
Yeah, Mother once told me
that Fort Rozz

11:31.908 --> 11:34.868
was rooted in space
above the rocks by an anchor.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.739
The guards come and go

11:36.783 --> 11:39.133
through a portal at the base.
If we can find the anchor--

11:39.176 --> 11:42.005
To try would only invite
the Phantoms' wrath!

11:42.049 --> 11:44.704
But if we do not provoke them,
they will leave us be.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.055
We are trapped here forever.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.447
We will never die,

11:49.491 --> 11:51.623
but we may yet survive.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.757
You must accept that, Kara,
or you will go mad,

11:54.801 --> 11:56.628
and remain so for eternity.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.942
So, will you be
watching the trial?

12:06.595 --> 12:08.162
Of course.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.729
You don't think I'd miss
an opportunity for the world

12:09.772 --> 12:11.252
to see my brother
as he really is?

12:11.295 --> 12:13.471
Well, what about who you are?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.605
What do you mean?

12:16.648 --> 12:20.000
You were there with Lex
through everything.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.610
But you haven't
spoken on the record

12:21.653 --> 12:23.743
and you haven't
been asked to testify.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.789
Think of the good it could do
if you aired
your firsthand experience

12:26.833 --> 12:28.573
and asked for forgiveness
publicly.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.100
I thought I was coming here
to catch up with a friend,

12:33.143 --> 12:34.841
but you're lobbying
for an interview.

12:34.884 --> 12:35.972
Oh...

12:37.844 --> 12:40.107
Please, Lena, I...

12:41.891 --> 12:44.807
I screwed up with Obsidian,
and CatCo barely survived.

12:44.851 --> 12:48.463
It's all I have left,
and it's in bad shape.

12:48.506 --> 12:52.859
If you go on the record,
maybe we can help each other.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.426
I'm sorry for your troubles,
I really am,

12:55.470 --> 12:56.819
but what happened
by Lex's side,

12:56.863 --> 12:58.473
I will never speak of publicly.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.083
I thought maybe
we could talk about it,

13:00.127 --> 13:01.955
especially after everything
we've been through.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.957
But I see now
that I was mistaken
because, as ever,

13:04.000 --> 13:05.697
you're always
putting yourself first.

13:05.741 --> 13:06.698
Keep the Scotch.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.230
Figured you guys
could use some lunch.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.971
So how are things going here?

13:18.014 --> 13:21.191
I mean, with Silas' help
and the nanobots to rebuild it,

13:21.235 --> 13:23.498
he can have Supergirl back
by sundown.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.542
Whoa.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.544
By sundown?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.938
We should order in
Dim Sum Delite's
entire stock of potstickers

13:28.982 --> 13:31.332
because she's gonna be starving
when she gets back.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.161
You're not listening to me.
Sundown isn't possible.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.902
Next week
might not be possible.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.512
The last time
I built this portal,

13:37.555 --> 13:39.557
it took six months of testing

13:39.601 --> 13:41.690
to make sure
I didn't burn to death
when I stepped through it.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.649
It's just wonderful
that you are all big,
powerful superheroes,

13:44.693 --> 13:47.870
but I can't guarantee
you won't
burn to death, either.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.090
I already have not saving
my husband on my conscience.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.395
I don't need your deaths, too.

13:55.965 --> 13:59.055
Hey, hey, I, um...
I got it. Okay?

14:01.057 --> 14:02.015
I, um...

14:04.756 --> 14:07.977
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

14:08.021 --> 14:11.851
Someone you love
more than anything
in the world.

14:11.894 --> 14:15.811
But Owen being
in the Phantom Zone
is not your fault.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.335
You need to forgive yourself
for what happened to him.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.163
I can't.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.732
The guilt is overwhelming.

14:23.775 --> 14:28.563
Of course you feel guilt.
Of course you feel shame.

14:28.606 --> 14:34.221
But those feelings
are there to remind you
that your love was real.

14:34.264 --> 14:37.311
And that is something that
no Phantom can take from you.

14:37.354 --> 14:41.358
Look, I know you're scared,
but you can do this.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.012
You can build that portal.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.753
You can make it work.

14:44.796 --> 14:48.757
And when you do,
we will save Supergirl.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.108
And every life
she saves from then on
will be thanks to you.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.633
And thanks to Owen.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.338
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

15:04.381 --> 15:06.470
for perhaps
the first time in history,

15:06.514 --> 15:10.387
"crimes against humanity"
carries literal weight.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.433
Lex Luthor stands accused

15:12.476 --> 15:15.392
of attempting to brainwash
half of humanity

15:15.436 --> 15:18.352
into loving him
and to murder the rest.

15:18.395 --> 15:22.399
<i>And this, in addition
to the actual murder
and conspiracy charges.</i>

15:22.443 --> 15:24.793
<i>Any one of these
should put him away
for life.</i>

15:24.836 --> 15:26.969
Through evidence
provided by Eve Tessmacher,

15:27.013 --> 15:29.885
who was present
for every terrible moment,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.061
we'll prove him guilty
of every charge.

15:39.503 --> 15:40.417
No, she won't.

15:49.513 --> 15:52.429
Look, I'm sorry. Sorry.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.344
You know this isn't...
You know this isn't
easy for me.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.738
Silas, I do not have time.

15:56.781 --> 15:59.697
Fix it. Fix it right now.

15:59.741 --> 16:03.397
J'onn, can I talk to you
outside?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.877
Get it done,
and don't immolate anyone.

16:08.619 --> 16:11.579
I know you think of Kara
as a daughter...

16:11.622 --> 16:13.059
when you've already lost two.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.932
I think of K'hym and T'ania
every day.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.284
But with Kara gone,
enduring all that alone...

16:22.633 --> 16:24.853
my memories
take a different shape.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.377
I'm worried about Kara, too.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.337
But I'm also worried
about you and Alex.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.904
You're running
yourselves ragged
trying to get her back

16:32.948 --> 16:34.732
and speed up the process.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.865
We've taken risks before.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.824
It's not risk I object to.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.044
This mission calls for
methodical planning,

16:42.088 --> 16:43.959
without ego or emotion.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.353
But instead
you're just charging ahead

16:46.396 --> 16:48.268
without getting
the lay of the land.

16:48.311 --> 16:49.660
You're not acting
like a soldier,

16:49.704 --> 16:52.315
you're acting like a father.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.883
I'd rather die
trying to get her back
than live with the guilt

16:54.926 --> 16:57.625
that I didn't do
everything that I could.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.061
I hear your wisdom, M'gann.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.019
I do.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.804
But we need to do this our way.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.244
You've been
incredibly strong today,
Miss Tessmacher.

17:08.288 --> 17:12.727
And I know it can't be easy
speaking truth to power
like this.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.556
But I have to ask you
one more question,

17:15.599 --> 17:19.690
and I implore you
to answer honestly
and clearly.

17:21.388 --> 17:24.391
Is the murderer of Dr. Jarrod
in this courtroom today?

17:25.783 --> 17:26.741
Yes.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.528
Lex Luthor.

17:31.572 --> 17:32.964
No further questions,
Your Honor.

17:34.662 --> 17:35.793
Your witness, Mr. Luthor.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.710
-Eve--
-Miss Tessmacher.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.801
Miss Tessmacher, then.

17:43.845 --> 17:48.980
When I returned home
after saving those
kidnapped VR users,

17:49.024 --> 17:50.460
who was waiting for me?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.811
I was.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.249
That's right. You surprised me
with a lavish candlelit dinner.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.120
Do you recall the entree?

17:58.164 --> 18:02.255
It was...
beef Wellington.

18:02.298 --> 18:05.606
Mmm. The meal was delicious,
I might add.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.955
Succulent, tender.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.826
Objection.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.698
-It's his opinion.
-I was just as surprised
at the quality

18:10.741 --> 18:13.135
as you, Ms. District Attorney.

18:13.179 --> 18:17.226
Which is why I asked Eve--
Miss Tessmacher,

18:18.793 --> 18:20.099
"What's the occasion?"

18:20.142 --> 18:21.404
And do you remember
what you said?

18:22.057 --> 18:23.841
I...

18:23.885 --> 18:26.540
Have you not sworn
to tell the truth today,
Miss Tessmacher?

18:26.583 --> 18:28.063
-I have.
-Objection.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.239
Then why did you
cook me dinner?

18:31.936 --> 18:34.939
Because I was in love with you!

18:34.983 --> 18:36.811
<i>And when I did not
reciprocate...</i>

18:36.854 --> 18:38.378
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,</i>

18:38.421 --> 18:42.556
I ask you,
what is more reasonable?

18:42.599 --> 18:47.909
Lex Luthor, philanthropist,
entrepreneur and hero

18:47.952 --> 18:51.173
committing these terrible crimes...

18:51.217 --> 18:55.438
or Eve Tessmacher, jilted lover
hell-bent on revenge,

18:55.482 --> 18:58.180
setting up the man
who would not have her,

18:58.224 --> 19:01.009
all to avoid punishment
for her own crimes.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.446
She had the means,
she had the motive

19:03.490 --> 19:05.492
and she had an image inducer.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.320
You made me hack Obsidian.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.322
You made me impersonate people.

19:09.365 --> 19:10.627
You made me kill.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.151
You made me do all of it--

19:12.194 --> 19:13.674
I demand
Miss Tessmacher's testimony

19:13.717 --> 19:15.545
be stricken from the record
and her plea deal revoked.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.504
Oh, uh,
and if you feel like throwing
in a charge of perjury,

19:17.547 --> 19:19.375
that'd be cool, too,
Your Honor.

19:38.264 --> 19:42.442
Let me guess.
Now that the trial
has turned in Lex's favor,

19:42.485 --> 19:44.879
you want me
to relinquish my shares

19:44.922 --> 19:46.576
and step down from the company,

19:46.620 --> 19:49.884
so Mama's number-one boy
can retain his rightful throne.

19:49.927 --> 19:53.714
On the contrary.
I'd like to sell you my shares.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.717
Why?

19:56.760 --> 20:00.068
Because Luthor Corp
in your brother's hands

20:00.111 --> 20:01.765
is nothing more than a weapon.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.377
We both know it.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.901
My shares, coupled with yours,
would form a majority

20:06.944 --> 20:09.730
Lex couldn't outvote
no matter how hard he schemed.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.691
Think of what you could do
with all that power.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.389
You're trying to bribe me.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.521
Why in the world would I need
to bribe my own daughter?

20:18.565 --> 20:20.958
Because you know I'm gonna
testify against Lex.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.265
An idiotic and childish notion.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.615
Eve's testimony
was the backbone of this case.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.878
Now that Lex
has completely damaged
her credibility,

20:27.922 --> 20:29.228
all her evidence is tainted.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.230
It's "fruit of
the poisonous tree."

20:31.273 --> 20:33.580
If I don't speak
to the brainwashing charges,

20:33.623 --> 20:34.668
then he might go free.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.453
So let him.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.587
Your brother nearly
threw everything away

20:40.630 --> 20:43.720
and revealed his true colors
to the world,

20:43.764 --> 20:46.593
but through cleverness
and sheer force of will,

20:46.636 --> 20:52.294
he has convinced the jury
that he's a good man
framed by an evil woman.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.558
That perception is good
for the entire family.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.038
The truth is good
for the family.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.432
The truth is
you did nothing to stop Lex

20:59.475 --> 21:01.216
until it was nearly too late.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.044
If you take that stand,

21:03.087 --> 21:04.785
you'll have to
accept your guilt

21:04.828 --> 21:07.744
for every single thing
you did by his side.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.443
And then the world
will not only
think Lex is evil,

21:10.486 --> 21:13.184
but they'll think you are, too,

21:13.228 --> 21:17.014
and the Luthor name
will be as good as worthless.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.321
It's time for Luthor
to do some actual good

21:19.365 --> 21:21.628
instead of just pretending to.

21:21.671 --> 21:23.325
If I have to risk my name
to make sure

21:23.369 --> 21:25.458
my brother stays
behind bars forever,
then I will.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.199
It's not a risk.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.158
It's a certainty.

21:30.201 --> 21:33.814
Lex won't hesitant
to take you down with him.

21:33.857 --> 21:37.296
And he knows better than anyone
how to get under your skin.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.340
Oh, I'm counting on it.

21:41.822 --> 21:45.782
Hey! Sorry.
I know, it was impossible
to get away from William.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.654
He just could not understand
what was more important

21:47.697 --> 21:49.220
than staking out
the courthouse.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.961
Now is not the time
to worry about William.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.702
Or Lex's trial,
for that matter.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.097
Now is the time to train.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.055
The Phantom Zone
is an environment

21:58.099 --> 22:00.493
unlike one
you've ever experienced.

22:00.536 --> 22:03.147
It will require
the highest levels
of your concentration

22:03.191 --> 22:05.715
to dream Supergirl's location
in there.

22:05.759 --> 22:10.067
Accordingly, I give you
my Phantom Zone simulation,

22:10.111 --> 22:14.507
meticulously crafted
from all known data
about the Zone.

22:14.550 --> 22:18.162
Sensors placed around the room
will record your dream energy.

22:18.206 --> 22:22.776
Any fluctuations, distractions
emotional incongruences

22:22.819 --> 22:25.648
will trigger the Phantoms
I've populated
this training exercise with

22:25.692 --> 22:27.128
to attack you,

22:27.171 --> 22:29.217
just as they will do
in the Phantom Zone.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.351
I got it.
Just like the holodeck
on <i>Next Gen.</i>

22:33.569 --> 22:35.484
Now,

22:35.528 --> 22:37.921
hidden somewhere
in this simulation
is my simulated Supergirl.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.882
Please close your eyes...

22:43.274 --> 22:44.580
...and try to divine
her location.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.503
Kara, wait up!

22:55.548 --> 22:56.853
Kara, just slow down.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.206
Kara and Alex
in high school.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.428
-What a surprising divination.
-It's not a divination.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.474
It's a distraction, Brainy.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.650
Well, try again.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.522
I could barely find you
when you were dying
on the Leviathan ship.

23:13.566 --> 23:14.871
I thought maybe
our relationship

23:14.915 --> 23:16.438
was what was
clouding my powers.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.440
But maybe I just don't know
what I'm doing.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.616
Without my mom or my sister,

23:20.660 --> 23:24.098
I don't have anyone
to actually teach me
how to interpret my dreams.

23:24.141 --> 23:27.318
And until I learn,
I'm never going to be
the hero I want to be.

23:32.149 --> 23:37.024
I'm from
the Legion of Superheroes,
where everything we did

23:37.067 --> 23:38.852
was through
the lens of Supergirl.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.637
Her virtue,
her accomplishments,
her drive.

23:41.681 --> 23:46.250
But you and I
have had the opportunity
to actually know her.

23:46.294 --> 23:48.296
And so we know she's more
than just Supergirl.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.733
She's Kara.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.519
She is our beacon
through the darkness.

23:53.562 --> 23:57.131
She's the example
we all aspire to emulate.

23:57.174 --> 24:01.135
So, yes, you may fear
that you will fail
to live up to Kara's example.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.486
But I am here to tell you,
in no uncertain terms,

24:04.530 --> 24:07.533
that you are not a liability
to this mission.

24:07.576 --> 24:10.013
You are the reason
it's going to succeed.

24:20.937 --> 24:21.851
Let's try again.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.293
I'm so sorry
you were lost here.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.602
I'm so sorry
you've endured
what you've endured.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.780
I'm going to help you
find your way again.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.218
I'm going to get us
out of here.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.351
I promise.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.113
Get away from her!

25:17.907 --> 25:19.300
I take it
you learned your lesson.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.478
I have to try again.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.699
Kara, I can't lose you again.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.570
Please,
we can live safely here.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.573
And do what?
Stare at cave walls
day in and day out

25:31.617 --> 25:33.575
until time loses all meaning?

25:33.619 --> 25:35.795
The father I knew
never would have accepted that.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.840
The father you knew
was hollowed out

25:37.884 --> 25:40.539
and devoured slowly
by the Phantoms.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.453
I'm trying to spare you that.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.064
You may think
you're stronger than I,

25:44.107 --> 25:46.588
but strength
doesn't matter here.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.764
The Phantom Zone isn't
something you can fight.

25:52.725 --> 25:53.726
You're right.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.903
I can't beat it.

25:56.946 --> 26:00.080
But I am going to do
everything I can to escape it.

26:00.123 --> 26:04.301
Even if it means I just get
an inch further every day.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.913
And I'm sorry for everything
you went through.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.697
But I would rather
live through torture

26:08.741 --> 26:12.222
and do something
than just exist
for the sake of it.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.268
The House of El is meant
for more than that.

26:18.011 --> 26:21.318
Well, I won't let my daughter
go into the rocks alone.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.582
So if you're going to
insist on trying...

26:28.369 --> 26:29.370
I'm going with you.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.982
Miss Tessmacher's testimony
has been thrown out

26:33.026 --> 26:34.810
and the murder charges
have been dropped,

26:34.854 --> 26:37.160
so perhaps we should be
getting to closing arguments.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.336
If there's no objection.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.730
Actually, Your Honor,
the people would like to call
one more witness.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.037
What could one more witness
possibly testify to?

26:46.735 --> 26:47.649
Everything else.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.393
<i>Non nocere.
It's "to do no harm."</i>

26:52.436 --> 26:54.525
I mean,
that was always my intention.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.876
To make the world
a better place,

26:56.919 --> 27:00.880
<i>to inhibit our desires
to hurt each other
emotionally and physically.</i>

27:00.923 --> 27:05.014
But Lex corrupted my technology
to turn every Obsidian user

27:05.058 --> 27:06.973
into his own
mindless followers,

27:07.016 --> 27:08.844
essentially brainwashing them.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.150
To what end?

27:11.586 --> 27:13.501
To get away with murder.

27:13.544 --> 27:14.894
No further questions,
Your Honor.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.112
Defense, your witness.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.595
Something funny, Mr. Luthor?

27:20.639 --> 27:21.770
Mmm.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.598
Not funny.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.383
Hilarious.

27:26.427 --> 27:30.692
My sister can couch her project
in flowery language,

27:30.736 --> 27:32.520
"make the world
a better place,"

27:32.563 --> 27:36.829
but put plainly,
she created a tool
to brainwash the masses.

27:36.872 --> 27:41.529
-Isn't that right, sis?
-Yes, I did.

27:41.572 --> 27:43.792
But I wasn't the one with
the motive to use it that way.

27:43.836 --> 27:46.447
Well, it's your word
against mine on that.
On...

27:46.490 --> 27:49.537
Well, pretty much all of it,
for that matter.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.540
Now, by your own admission,
you yourself would have had

27:52.583 --> 27:56.239
both the means
and the opportunity
to commit the brainwashing

27:56.283 --> 27:58.415
of which I stand accused,
Would you not?

27:58.459 --> 28:01.549
No. Because in the trial phase,
it became clear that

28:01.592 --> 28:03.420
Non nocere
was irreparably flawed.
I abandoned it.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.379
But then how could I have
possibly used your creation

28:05.422 --> 28:07.816
to brainwash anybody
if it didn't really work?

28:07.860 --> 28:09.513
I said it was flawed.
Not that it didn't work.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.037
I was filing patents
when you were in diapers.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.560
Why would I waste my time

28:12.603 --> 28:14.605
workshopping your faulty
science fair project?

28:14.649 --> 28:16.564
Because your little sister
had created something
that you needed.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.261
Something that you could
never have come up with
on your own.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.741
You've never done anything
on your own.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.395
-You've always needed me.
-Objection.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.918
You can't stand that
I don't need you anymore.

28:22.962 --> 28:24.224
Sustained.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.616
Without me,
your precious non nocere

28:25.660 --> 28:27.270
would've never
gotten off the ground.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.184
And so you think you can just
take credit for my work?

28:28.228 --> 28:29.142
You're damn right, I can.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.320
I have always taken
the big swings
that you never would.

28:33.363 --> 28:36.279
But I supported you,
because you're a Luthor.

28:36.323 --> 28:39.021
I kept you by my side
when you were
too timid and weak

28:39.065 --> 28:41.415
to do what was necessary.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.765
It takes guts to wield power.

28:48.074 --> 28:50.772
And I wield my power
to make the world better.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.253
So did I help develop
non nocere? Yes.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.646
And yes, non nocere failed.

28:55.690 --> 28:56.996
Boo-hoo, it happens.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.128
But instead of
accepting that humbly,

28:59.172 --> 29:01.740
my sister blames me for it.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.916
It's no surprise
that this entire case

29:03.959 --> 29:06.135
has fallen apart
when every single charge

29:06.179 --> 29:08.398
hinges on
the unsubstantiated hearsay

29:08.442 --> 29:12.359
of bitter women
like my sister and Eve.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.795
Women who, mind you,

29:13.839 --> 29:15.841
could have committed
these crimes themselves,

29:15.884 --> 29:17.538
<i>as could any number
of other suspects</i>

29:17.581 --> 29:19.018
<i>that the prosecutor
has overlooked</i>

29:19.061 --> 29:22.064
in her obsession
with targeting me, and why?

29:22.108 --> 29:24.153
Because I am powerful!

29:25.851 --> 29:28.070
So let that be
a lesson to you all.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.420
If you try to build
a good life for yourself,

29:30.464 --> 29:32.727
there is always somebody
waiting to tear you down

29:32.771 --> 29:34.642
and punish you
for your greatness.

29:35.686 --> 29:36.818
But I accept who I am.

29:39.603 --> 29:43.564
I like power,
and I have the guts
to do something with it.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.308
I did not commit the crimes
of which I stand accused.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.137
But if I had,
who could blame me?

29:51.180 --> 29:53.139
If push came to shove,
you'd have done it.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.144
The defense rests.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.365
Yes! Come on.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.679
You sure
this thing won't blow up?

30:11.722 --> 30:14.595
It won't blow up,
but I can't guarantee
it won't implode.

30:15.726 --> 30:16.858
Let's bring Supergirl home.

30:27.086 --> 30:30.219
It doesn't look like
the simulations, Brainy.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.135
No.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.615
This isn't right.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.399
The Phantom Zone
has been fractured somehow.

30:38.053 --> 30:41.361
Of course. Crisis.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.797
When all the timelines
converged into one,

30:42.841 --> 30:45.104
the opposite
must have happened here.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.541
It's no longer
one pocket dimension,
but many.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.499
An interdimensional
archipelago.

30:49.543 --> 30:51.719
Well, Dreamer
should still be able
to find her in there.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.982
Every dimension has
its own vibrational frequency.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.854
We would have to go to each one
before Dreamer could even try.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.334
And it's moving
in a randomized pattern.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.293
It would take years for us
to make it to each of them.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.555
Supergirl is in there, okay?

31:01.598 --> 31:03.122
We are not
not going to go get her.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.123
Alex, wait.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.646
I won't give up on Kara.

31:05.689 --> 31:06.952
I'm not gonna lose you, too.

31:11.782 --> 31:12.740
Phantoms!

31:36.851 --> 31:40.159
The Phantoms
disrupted the portal.
We need to get it back online.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.029
On it.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.731
Not again.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.908
Silas, we have to send
the Phantoms back.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.300
I need you to help me.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.780
Please, don't let them take me.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.086
These creepy bastards
aren't going to

31:54.129 --> 31:55.609
take any more of us.

31:55.652 --> 31:56.915
Okay? Do it for Owen.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.310
I'll cover you.

32:38.173 --> 32:41.133
This isn't gonna
hold them forever.

32:41.176 --> 32:44.832
Your dream power
helped me in the past.
Allow me to repay the favor.

32:44.875 --> 32:45.876
Both of us.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.619
Oh, that is much better!

32:51.882 --> 32:56.061
-Anytime you're ready, Silas.
-I'm trying. Come on,
you stupid thing.

33:02.545 --> 33:03.546
Now!

33:15.254 --> 33:16.342
All rise.

33:20.259 --> 33:24.002
In the case of <i>the People of the United States of America v. Lex Luthor...</i>

33:24.045 --> 33:26.004
You found them?
Everything all set?

33:26.047 --> 33:27.048
Judge?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.094
-Jury?
-Executioner.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.399
...to which
the defendant stands
accused of conspiracy

33:30.443 --> 33:31.009
and murder
in the first degree...

33:31.052 --> 33:32.575
Kablooey!

33:32.619 --> 33:34.490
...Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

33:34.534 --> 33:36.318
<i>We have, Your Honor.</i>

33:36.362 --> 33:40.496
<i>In the matter of</i> National City
v. Alexander Joseph Luthor,

33:40.540 --> 33:45.936
<i>we, the jury,
find the defendant
not guilty on all counts.</i>

33:48.591 --> 33:49.505
Uh...

33:49.549 --> 33:51.072
Wait, you actually won?

33:51.116 --> 33:52.117
Mr. Luthor is now
cleared of all charges...

33:52.160 --> 33:54.380
Not that I'm surprised, boss.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.076
...and will be released
from government custody
effective immediately.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.817
Well, I am.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.471
Clearly I underestimated
the value of just being myself.

33:58.514 --> 33:59.950
I'd like to thank
the jury for their service.

33:59.994 --> 34:00.821
You performed
your civic duty admirably.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.257
No kablooey.

34:02.301 --> 34:03.171
This court
now stands adjourned.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.781
Of course not, you idiot.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.087
I'm sorry things were different
than you expected

34:06.131 --> 34:08.307
and you couldn't save
your friend.

34:08.350 --> 34:11.397
But just because
you couldn't save her this time
doesn't mean you won't.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.487
I think we all need
to at least take a beat.

34:14.530 --> 34:18.578
It's been a rough day,
but we will figure this out.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.493
<i>Breaking news. Lex Luthor
has been exonerated.</i>

34:20.536 --> 34:23.365
Guys, it's about to get
a lot worse.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.976
<i>I would like to
congratulate the jury</i>

34:26.020 --> 34:28.196
<i>on coming to the right decision</i>

34:28.240 --> 34:31.678
<i>in spite of the clear prejudice in the media coverage
of my trial.</i>

34:31.721 --> 34:34.507
CatCo published
a glorified hit piece

34:34.550 --> 34:36.639
painting me as guilty
and then allowed

34:36.683 --> 34:40.730
the same biased journalist
to single-handedly
cover my trial.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.124
Oh, gods. I've got to
get back to CatCo.

34:43.168 --> 34:47.215
<i>It all comes down to
a lack of hard evidence and a lot of reasonable doubt.</i>

34:47.259 --> 34:48.999
<i>It's the system, you see.</i>

34:49.043 --> 34:50.871
<i>They pick a powerful guy and they try to tear him down.</i>

34:50.914 --> 34:52.612
<i>No one deserves
a life sentence for that.</i>

34:52.655 --> 34:55.049
Okay, enough of this farce.

34:55.093 --> 34:58.531
The trial may be over,
but we are not.

34:58.574 --> 35:03.144
William, get out there
and find me
my next Lexposé.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.276
Back to work.

35:09.019 --> 35:13.285
William! William, I am so sorry
I didn't make it back
to the courthouse.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.461
It wouldn't have made
a difference.

35:15.504 --> 35:18.028
I'm not sure any of this
does anymore, really.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.465
Of course it does.

35:19.508 --> 35:22.337
Look, Lex got acquitted,
and there is nothing

35:22.381 --> 35:24.339
that we could have
done about that.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.820
But when he tries
something again tomorrow,

35:26.863 --> 35:29.301
that is something
we can do something about.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.346
We can still make a difference.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.478
We just can't stop trying.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.749
Come on,
you guys have been at it
for hours.

35:44.011 --> 35:44.838
Eat.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.191
How are you guys doing?

35:50.235 --> 35:52.498
Brainy's still running
analytics on the projector.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.892
It's slow going,
but we're making progress
on mapping the Phantom Zone.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.852
I wasn't talking about the job,
I was talking about you.

36:00.288 --> 36:01.594
Oh.

36:01.637 --> 36:03.204
Right.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.424
I was just thinking
how right you were,

36:05.467 --> 36:09.906
about methodical planning,
without ego or emotion.

36:12.735 --> 36:18.088
If I hadn't been so reactive,
rushing us into a risky plan.

36:18.132 --> 36:19.481
Well, your plan
would have worked

36:19.525 --> 36:21.701
if the Phantom Zone
weren't fractured.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.703
Yeah, but if I had been
more thorough,

36:23.746 --> 36:24.965
have Brainy map it before,

36:25.008 --> 36:26.619
we would've been
prepared for that.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.621
Well, now,
we will be next time.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.190
But I know
you're going through a lot.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.104
You can talk to me.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.284
But I almost lost you today...

36:40.502 --> 36:43.026
and Alex, everyone.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.681
I need to do what I must
to get Kara back.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.902
Until then,
I need to follow your advice.

36:48.945 --> 36:53.950
Stop thinking
in terms of family
and just be a soldier.

36:56.605 --> 36:59.173
<i>Mr. Luthor,
now that you're free,
what's next?</i>

36:59.217 --> 37:03.830
<i>I'm just glad that I can return to making a difference
as a free man.</i>

37:07.312 --> 37:09.662
These 21st-century
keyboards suck.

37:20.368 --> 37:21.282
Alex?

37:24.416 --> 37:26.635
I couldn't...
I couldn't get her back. I...

37:29.334 --> 37:31.597
I couldn't save her.

37:31.640 --> 37:36.297
Hey, that's more than anyone
could have pulled off in a day.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.516
No, it's not just today.

37:40.214 --> 37:41.998
I mean, what if we never...
What...

37:44.000 --> 37:47.308
What if she's really gone?

37:47.352 --> 37:52.835
I mean,
how am I supposed to accept
a world without Kara in it?

37:54.707 --> 37:57.144
The only thing
that you have to accept

37:57.187 --> 37:59.538
is that this
could take a while.

37:59.581 --> 38:02.497
But you are going to
keep fighting,
and so is she.

38:02.541 --> 38:07.067
Yeah, but that's the thing,
I don't know if I can.

38:07.110 --> 38:11.680
This isn't just a hard path.
I don't see any path at all.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.117
We're nowhere, Kelly.

38:14.161 --> 38:17.295
We are nowhere,
and she is alone

38:17.338 --> 38:19.427
and I might not
ever see her again.

38:24.345 --> 38:27.000
<i>Another surprising turn
of events. Lex Luthor</i>

38:27.043 --> 38:28.915
<i>has called for
the District Attorney</i>

38:28.958 --> 38:32.005
<i>to instead consider charges
against his sister, Lena,</i>

38:32.048 --> 38:33.963
<i>who in the process
of testifying today...</i>

38:34.007 --> 38:35.791
<i>-...may have implicated herself</i>

38:35.835 --> 38:36.879
<i>in criminal activity.</i>

38:43.321 --> 38:45.671
So much for not speaking
about Lex publicly, huh?

38:47.412 --> 38:49.022
I owe you an apology.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.937
I was behaving
selfishly earlier.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.069
You saved my life.

38:53.113 --> 38:54.636
I shouldn't have
tried to use you.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.250
And I shouldn't have
jumped down your throat.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.210
It was hypocritical.

39:03.253 --> 39:06.474
I'm intimately aware
of how difficult it is
to make amends.

39:06.518 --> 39:10.739
Well, you did it in style,
coming forward
despite the difficulty.

39:12.175 --> 39:13.655
Honestly,
I wish I was brave enough

39:13.699 --> 39:15.440
to confront my father
like that.

39:15.483 --> 39:18.051
By giving him
a platform to grandstand

39:18.094 --> 39:19.748
that backfires so disastrously

39:19.792 --> 39:22.055
that the DA ends up
investigating you instead?

39:22.098 --> 39:24.536
By using his own
strategies against him.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.758
You pushed Lex right
where you wanted him.

39:29.802 --> 39:33.414
No one could have expected
the jury to sympathize.

39:33.458 --> 39:36.243
We'll keep going after Lex
with everything CatCo's got.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.767
I will, too.

39:38.811 --> 39:42.075
And if the justice system
doesn't stop him, then I will.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.555
Well, I'll drink to that.

39:46.122 --> 39:50.997
I admit I didn't expect
your little performance
be so effective.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.652
You underestimated me
even more than I did, Mother.

39:55.044 --> 39:56.698
No one should have been able

39:56.742 --> 39:58.787
to Houdini themselves
out of a situation like that.

39:58.831 --> 40:02.182
Please. Houdini
was all about tricks,
whereas I am now seeing

40:02.225 --> 40:04.489
the value of unvarnished truth.

40:04.532 --> 40:08.623
Two words
I never thought I'd hear
applied to a Luthor.

40:08.667 --> 40:13.280
And how does my narrative suit
our beloved family name now?

40:13.323 --> 40:15.369
Far better than your sister's.

40:15.413 --> 40:19.591
Hmm. From mass murderer
to vindicated martyr
in one fell swoop,

40:19.634 --> 40:21.549
and all I needed was me.

40:23.203 --> 40:26.162
I wasted so much time
trying to buy, threaten

40:26.206 --> 40:28.121
or brainwash people into
doing what I wanted.

40:28.164 --> 40:33.126
But apparently,
people love a guy
who tells it like it is.

40:33.169 --> 40:35.520
The key is,
if you can get them
to buy it long enough,

40:35.563 --> 40:36.999
they stop being able to discern

40:37.043 --> 40:39.306
whether you're telling it
like it really is,

40:39.349 --> 40:43.049
or how you want them
to believe it is.

40:47.227 --> 40:48.968
Ah, damn it.

40:49.011 --> 40:52.232
Which one of you
thieving idiots drank
my O negative?

41:02.416 --> 41:03.809
<i>J'onn, I think the Phantom
did something to me.</i>

41:03.852 --> 41:06.376
Please come.
I think I need help.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.623
Where did they just go?

41:35.667 --> 41:38.713
I have no idea.
I've never seen a Phantom
do anything like that.

41:38.757 --> 41:40.541
Well, if they use portals
to get around,

41:40.585 --> 41:42.325
maybe we can use one
to get out.

41:42.369 --> 41:44.502
It looks like the portals only
open and close long enough

41:44.545 --> 41:46.199
for a Phantom
to get through it.

41:46.242 --> 41:48.375
Then I guess
we're gonna have
to catch a Phantom.
