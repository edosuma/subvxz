09:22.311 --> 09:25.022
-You okay?
-Oh. Yeah, sorry.

09:25.106 --> 09:29.110
These satin pants are really slippery.
I just slid right out of my chair.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.863
So, what do you think of the job offer?

09:32.947 --> 09:35.074
Oh, it's an amazing opportunity.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.702
Could I just maybe have a day or two
to mull it over?

09:37.785 --> 09:38.661
Of course.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.871
But if it sweetens the deal,

09:40.955 --> 09:43.499
the job comes with a signing bonus
and crab cakes.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.500
[chuckles softly]

09:50.923 --> 09:54.468
Oh, hey, Fabiola. Are you coming
to the barbecue for all the early admits?

09:54.552 --> 09:59.015
Um, no. No, I… I don't like parties
or… or sauced meats.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.516
You haven't told Devi yet, have you?

10:01.517 --> 10:03.144
I just can't.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.812
Okay, listen.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.397
The barbecue is in the faculty lot.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.399
And you are not
gonna run into her out there.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.484
So just come for a minute.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.987
You deserve to celebrate
this amazing achievement.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.448
Plus, you have to try my coleslaw.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.283
It started out as egg salad.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.036
[exhales]

10:22.705 --> 10:24.749
So how come you wanna do a sport?

10:25.541 --> 10:28.836
You're not, like, you know, athletic.

10:29.795 --> 10:34.008
Well, if you must know,
Princeton… deferred me.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.344
That's not so bad.
At least you weren't rejected.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.137
Hmm. Right.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.431
Anyway, I need to see
what I can add to my résumé

10:40.514 --> 10:42.266
to make myself seem
more desirable to them.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.769
And you think doing grunt work
for boys' swim

10:44.852 --> 10:45.978
is gonna make the difference?

10:46.062 --> 10:49.357
[sighs] Maybe.
I don't know. I'll try anything.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.441
[chuckles]

10:50.524 --> 10:52.985
I know this is the wrong thing
to say right now,

10:53.069 --> 10:55.237
but it does make me feel a little better

10:55.321 --> 10:57.573
that someone like you
also has college struggles.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.327
Well, great. I am glad my suffering
is bringing you such joy.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.411
[chuckles softly]

11:03.412 --> 11:05.456
Oh. Uh, hello, Coach.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.209
I'm here about the swim team
equipment manager job.

11:08.292 --> 11:10.086
As you can see here,
I type 100 words per minute.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.422
I'm proficient with Microsoft Word
and Excel. And my strengths have been--

11:13.506 --> 11:16.592
Yeah, fine. You can have the job.
You look pretty sturdy.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.762
Now, the season doesn't start
until after winter break,

11:19.845 --> 11:23.224
but since you're here,
get the new Speedos out of my trunk.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.185
The old ones had thinned,
and we had too many pop-outs.

11:27.978 --> 11:28.813
Ugh.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.193
[Devi sighs]

11:37.822 --> 11:39.031
[party music playing]

11:39.115 --> 11:40.074
[sighs]

11:40.157 --> 11:42.159
[indistinct chatter]

11:43.536 --> 11:47.206
[McEnroe] Ugh! There it was,
the early-decision barbecue.

11:47.289 --> 11:51.043
Look at them all celebrating
under that braggy marquee.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.712
Devi should be over there.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.256
Instead, she was
retrieving men's underwear

11:55.339 --> 11:56.966
from a ten-year-old Kia.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.593
Wait, the Princeton snake

11:59.677 --> 12:02.388
is probably slithering around
in that crowd.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.891
Maybe it's time for a little pest control.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.060
Okay, there's Washington State.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.687
There were the Duke kids.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.646
And Columbia.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.190
Devi didn't see a single stray.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.484
Not one random…

12:20.698 --> 12:21.574
Fab?

12:22.533 --> 12:24.785
Why are you at the early-admits barbecue?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.121
Oh, I was just hungry. [chuckles]

12:28.038 --> 12:30.458
Be honest. Did you actually apply to Yale?

12:31.876 --> 12:32.877
Devi, I…

12:32.960 --> 12:34.420
[students cheering]

12:34.503 --> 12:35.421
[student 1] Fabiola!

12:35.504 --> 12:36.547
[student 2] Fabiola!

12:36.630 --> 12:38.382
[student cheering and applauding]

12:38.466 --> 12:39.508
[student 3] Fabiola!

12:40.468 --> 12:42.428
Devi, I am so sorry. Let me explain.

12:42.511 --> 12:43.846
[Devi] Don't bother.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.347
[sighs]

12:45.431 --> 12:46.599
[indistinct chatter]

12:46.682 --> 12:48.601
[soft music playing]

12:50.519 --> 12:53.397
Hey. Is this your painting?
Wow, that is awesome.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.902
Thanks. Oh God, that's Kade Andrews.
He's the gallery owner. Act natural.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.362
[indistinct chatter]

13:00.446 --> 13:03.240
He had a Samantha Rosenwald
before her solo show at Stanley's.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.325
[Margot inhales deeply]

13:04.408 --> 13:06.368
-Do you know what that means?
-No.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.829
Hi there. Is this your piece?

13:08.913 --> 13:09.872
Yeah.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.916
Do you… Do you… Do you hate it?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.418
No, I love it, actually.
Your perspective is super fresh.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.629
-You're very talented.
-[Ben] Isn't she?

13:16.712 --> 13:19.298
You know, I'm always telling her
to turn her art into NFTs

13:19.381 --> 13:21.467
so she can make some bank. [laughs]

13:24.845 --> 13:28.057
Hey, why don't I get us some drinks
while you guys talk art and stuff?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.144
[sighs]

13:34.730 --> 13:35.898
[phone vibrating]

13:38.359 --> 13:40.236
Hey, do you have a drink request?

13:40.319 --> 13:44.156
[Kade] Yeah, the sun, and how it radiates
out here. Absolutely inspired.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.950
[Margot] Thanks. I… I thought so too.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.494
-It kinda has a burnt orange color to it.
-Butt dial. [chuckles]

13:48.577 --> 13:52.081
[Kade] So is that, uh, small, anxious dude
your boyfriend?

13:52.164 --> 13:56.919
Uh, yeah. I mean, I don't know.
It's not that serious, so…

13:57.002 --> 14:00.464
Yeah, yeah, he seems a bit buttoned up
to be dating someone like you.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.425
-Kind of an Urkel vibe.
-[laughs] Totally.

14:04.093 --> 14:04.927
[Kade] Yeah.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.888
[McEnroe] Well,
that's a pretty brutal thing to overhear.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.642
And across town,
Devi was equally shell-shocked.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.144
-How could her best friend do this to her?
-[door slams]

14:14.228 --> 14:16.021
How could Princeton do this to her?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.148
Devi, what did I say about slamming doors?

14:18.232 --> 14:19.358
It's for white children.

14:19.441 --> 14:23.028
Okay, Mom, I just found out that Fabiola
applied to Princeton behind my back

14:23.112 --> 14:24.321
and got in.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.116
Oh, kanna, I am so sorry.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.577
But this is really
what I was trying to tell you.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.079
-Sometimes things don't go our way.
-Mom, come on.

14:32.162 --> 14:35.207
I really don't wanna listen
to anything rational right now.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.880
Sorry, Len, I don't think
Devi's gonna join us for dinner.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.799
Oh. I was making somethin' special.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.301
[door slams]

14:45.384 --> 14:47.011
Does no one here know how to use a door?

14:47.094 --> 14:49.722
Auntie, Pati,
I need to speak to you two in private.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.348
Hello, Len.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.851
[tense music playing]

14:59.982 --> 15:02.484
Okay, I hate to be the one
to tell you this, Pati,

15:02.568 --> 15:06.322
but I think that Len is not the man
that you think he is.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.282
Today, I saw him with a woman

15:08.365 --> 15:11.619
who was wearing what I can only describe
as business lingerie.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.954
Well, he has a lot of female friends.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.081
He's a regular at several Zumba classes.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.125
No, they were not just friends.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.084
[inhales deeply]

15:19.168 --> 15:21.420
I think that he brought her
to this house before.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.131
I'm not worried about Len
running around on me.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.925
I keep my man very satisfied.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.052
Too much, Mami, just-- It's too much.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.513
I also think that they're involved in
some kind of, like, money-making scheme.

15:31.597 --> 15:35.225
[chuckles] Len doesn't need
money-making schemes. I'm rich.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.937
-What do you mean you're rich?
-Oh.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.315
When my husband died,
Mohan convinced me to invest,

15:41.398 --> 15:43.567
so I put all my money into Apple

15:43.651 --> 15:45.611
because it's such a cute name.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.614
At that time,
the shares were only a quarter.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.782
Oh my God.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.409
And yet you never once offered
to pitch in for groceries.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.703
That's how the rich stay rich, baby.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.998
-[Kamala sighs]
-Ladies, dinner is ready.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.584
But let's hold up a second.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.294
I wanna say something to Nirmala.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.506
Nirmy, these past few months

16:05.589 --> 16:08.509
have been the most amazing
of my entire life,

16:09.093 --> 16:13.430
so I want the rest of my months on Earth

16:14.139 --> 16:16.725
to be as happy as they are now.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.229
So, what I'm saying is…

16:20.312 --> 16:21.480
-[Nalini gasps]
-Nirmy…

16:22.147 --> 16:24.441
[romantic music playing]

16:24.525 --> 16:26.068
…will you marry me?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.863
Oh, Len. Yes, I will.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.782
[Len] You will? Oh!

16:31.865 --> 16:36.078
[McEnroe] Uh-oh, Kamala, it looks like Len
does have a money-making plan,

16:36.161 --> 16:37.830
and it is your grandmother.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.084
["Fruit Sandwich"
by Aaron Joseph Russo playing]

16:45.170 --> 16:46.296
[sighs]

16:48.424 --> 16:49.299
What's wrong?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.803
[sighs] I thought
making out would cheer you up,

16:52.886 --> 16:56.223
but it's honestly kind of bumming me out
to kiss someone so sad.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.144
[sighs] Sorry.
I just feel really bad about Devi.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.520
Fab, come on.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.356
You did something extraordinary.
Devi should be happy for you.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.151
And if she can't be, then whatever.
You'll make new friends in college.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.610
I don't want new friends.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.154
You say that now, but you will.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.031
I never talk
to my high school friends anymore,

17:12.114 --> 17:13.949
mostly 'cause a lot of them
got really into EDM.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.493
Addison, I don't wanna not talk
to my high-school friends.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.162
I want Devi in my life forever.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.872
Okay, okay, sorry.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.333
Listen, if your friendship
is as strong as you say it is,

17:23.417 --> 17:26.045
then Devi will get past this.
You just have to talk to her.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.297
[sighs] You think so?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.340
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.

17:30.966 --> 17:35.220
Now, how about we really cheer you up
and watch some sexy cyborgs on Westworld?

17:36.263 --> 17:37.848

17:42.603 --> 17:44.563
-Hi.
-Seriously, where's your bag?

17:44.646 --> 17:46.899
It's somewhere in my locker.

17:46.982 --> 17:47.900
Ugh.

17:48.901 --> 17:49.902
Hey, can we please talk?

17:49.985 --> 17:52.446
Oh, are there other dreams of mine
that you wanna steal?

17:52.529 --> 17:53.614
[mumbles]

17:53.697 --> 17:57.076
Uh, Devi, stop. Hear her out.
I really need for you to be friends again.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.828
How can I be friends
with someone I don't even recognize?

17:59.912 --> 18:04.333
-Since when do you wanna go to Princeton?
-I wanted to tell you, but how could I?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.210
I don't know, maybe with words?

18:06.293 --> 18:09.296
[scoffs] I can't believe you'd lie
about something so important to me.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.799
I know. I am so, so sorry.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.718
You know what? Being deferred
was already a stab in the heart.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.054
I didn't also need to be
stabbed in the back.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.139
[somber music playing]

18:23.769 --> 18:25.562
Sitch still a little tender, huh?

18:26.688 --> 18:28.148
I actually came to talk to Eleanor.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.525
So contrary to the email,

18:29.608 --> 18:32.277
we're gonna need you here
at 6:00 on Friday, not 7:00. [chuckles]

18:32.361 --> 18:34.279
-That's when everyone's lining up for--
-Sh!

18:36.156 --> 18:38.200
[inhales] Okay, this little friend group

18:38.283 --> 18:40.911
needs to do a much better job
of communicating.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.789
What was she talking about?

18:50.212 --> 18:51.505
Hey, guess what.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.383
Kade's putting my painting in his gallery.
Isn't that amazing?

18:54.466 --> 18:56.468
-Yeah, it's really great.
-I know.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.139
So what happened to you last night?
You just disappeared.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.808
Did you accidentally eat dairy again?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.977
No, and I can have dairy
as long as I have my pills.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.604
No, I left last night
because you butt-dialed me,

19:07.688 --> 19:10.190
and I didn't wanna ruin the night
with my "Urkel energy."

19:10.983 --> 19:13.819
Oh God. Ben, I… I'm so sorry.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.988
It's pretty rough
to hear your girlfriend of six months

19:16.071 --> 19:17.990
say that your relationship
isn't very serious.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.326
Almost as rough as sitting through
a magic show for one.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.580
I'm so stupid.
I… I was just trying to impress that guy.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.207
Of course I think
our relationship is serious.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.210
It's just… the art world
is super judgy, and--

19:30.294 --> 19:33.589
-And you're embarrassed of me.
-No, I… I'm not embarrassed of you.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.384
[inhales deeply] We're just different.
You're a little more tightly wound.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.013
I mean, I've never met a teen boy
who starches his shirts.

19:41.096 --> 19:44.016
What's the point of having a collar
if it's not crisp? [sighs]

19:44.099 --> 19:47.060
You know, yesterday was supposed to be
one of the best days of my life.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.062
I got this thing
that I'd worked for years for,

19:49.146 --> 19:52.566
and I went from feeling like a winner
to such a loser in seconds.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.485
Margot, I can't be with someone
who thinks I'm a loser.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.695
I don't think you're a loser.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.156
I… I'm trying to tell you
that I love how dorky you are.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.116
[scoffs] Yeah, that sucks.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.160
I think we're done.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.579
And, uh, for what it's worth,
Kade is the loser.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.414
His '80s vintage leather jacket?

20:07.497 --> 20:10.167
It's from Club Monaco.
My mom has the same one.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.710
-[somber music playing]
-Ben--

20:14.755 --> 20:16.673
[mumbling]

20:19.134 --> 20:20.594
[muttering] Stupid.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.765
Okay. Hey.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.350
You still mad about Princeton?

20:26.433 --> 20:28.227
[sighs] Yeah.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.145
And at my best friend who stole my spot.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.481
Fabiola got in.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.566
Oh, well, that's awesome for her.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.028
No, Paxton, it's not awesome.
One of my friendships has now been ruined.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.156
Okay, I think we're being
a little dramatic here.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.243
-This shouldn't ruin your friendship.
-What are you talking about?

20:44.326 --> 20:45.661
What if Trent applied to ASU?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.371
I'd be freaking psyched.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.082
Hell, if Trent went to ASU,
I'd probably still be there.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.376
Uh-- But what if he kept it from you
that he applied?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.378
I'd assume he had a good reason.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.172
Or that he concussed himself
on his Onewheel again.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.382
Hmm.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.926
But look, you know why Fabiola
couldn't tell you.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.053
-[Devi scoffs]
-Because you flip out.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.931
I deserve to flip out. This was my dream.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.015
[sighs]

21:07.099 --> 21:08.892
Ugh. You don't get it.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.561
Oh, I get it.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.065
If you remember, I had some
pretty solid dreams for college,

21:15.148 --> 21:17.567
but then someone made me get hit by a car.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.072
But, hey, I forgave you, didn't I?
I mean, I more than forgave you.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.241
We did, like,
a lot of making out after that.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.158
[chuckles]

21:26.535 --> 21:28.954
Hey, you gotta let it go, all right?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.789
This is not worth losing
a good friend over.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.209
Yeah, I guess so.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.921
Hey, you're kind of wise
now that you're on staff.

21:38.005 --> 21:38.922
[inhales deeply]

21:39.006 --> 21:41.675
Too bad that they make you wear
this sad-sack uniform though.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.801
Mm-hmm.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.261
You know I still look good.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.018
[school bell ringing]

21:51.101 --> 21:52.811
[indistinct chatter]

21:56.356 --> 21:58.317
[Mr. Shapiro] Okay, scholars,

21:58.400 --> 22:03.196
it is time to present
your final projects of the semester.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.034
Now, in an effort
to right the wrongs of our history,

22:07.117 --> 22:11.830
let's let a strong woman of color
speak first.

22:12.873 --> 22:13.874
Fabiola?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.210
Oh. Okay. Um…

22:24.551 --> 22:27.929
My topic is about
American isolationism in the 1930s.

22:28.013 --> 22:28.972
[Mr. Shapiro] Mmm.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.978
"Following the devastation of World War I
and the Great Depression,

22:35.062 --> 22:38.190
America chose to close itself off
from other countries."

22:38.273 --> 22:40.692
"But here's the thing about isolationism,

22:42.778 --> 22:44.029
is everyone needs friends."

22:45.072 --> 22:49.451
And America,
she deeply needs her best allies.

22:49.951 --> 22:54.247
She depends on them
for protection, for stability,

22:54.331 --> 22:56.708
for fun sleepovers.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.712
Anyway…

23:03.131 --> 23:05.842
she's just really sorry
that she let her best ally down

23:06.676 --> 23:08.845
at the beginning of World War II.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.807
[Mr. Shapiro] That was beautiful.

23:12.307 --> 23:16.269
And it is always nice
to be reminded of America's pronouns.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.065
[sighs]

23:20.148 --> 23:21.733
Hey, Fab, are you okay?

23:21.817 --> 23:23.985
No, don't comfort me. I'm a bad friend.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.278
No, you're not.

23:25.779 --> 23:26.863
I'm the problem here.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.158
I don't own Princeton.
You're obviously allowed to apply there.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.952
Even so, I shouldn't have lied to you.

23:32.035 --> 23:32.869
[sighs]

23:33.370 --> 23:34.621
But I get why you did.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.793
I am so sorry that I made you feel like
you couldn't talk to me.

23:40.293 --> 23:43.338
-I never want that to be true again.
-Me either.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.425
And hey, you got into Princeton, Fab.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.552
That is sick.
Do you think you're gonna go?

23:49.136 --> 23:50.929
Would you kill me if I said I wasn't sure?

23:51.012 --> 23:52.806
[sighs] Of course not.

23:53.306 --> 23:56.143
Because if you don't go,
that opens up a spot for this bitch.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.144
[chuckles]

23:57.227 --> 23:58.228
[inhales deeply]

23:58.311 --> 24:00.939
Yeah, I think I'm still gonna apply
to other schools.

24:01.022 --> 24:04.151
Like, this may sound weird,
but when we visited Princeton,

24:04.234 --> 24:05.485
I just didn't feel a spark.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.029
I mean, it has an incredible
robotics program,

24:08.113 --> 24:09.739
and it's perfect on paper, but like--

24:09.823 --> 24:12.409
You know you don't have to marry
your college, right?

24:12.492 --> 24:13.743
[sighs]

24:13.827 --> 24:17.956
But I get what you're saying.
I do feel a spark about Princeton.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.500
Yeah, I… I probably will too
when I go there.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.586
-I'm being dumb, forget it.
-[chuckles softly]

24:22.669 --> 24:25.589
Oh. And when you get in,
maybe we could be roomies.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.549
Oh my God, yeah. That'd be dope.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.550
[chuckles]

24:29.676 --> 24:30.927
[sighs]

24:31.011 --> 24:32.554
Are you guys okay?

24:32.637 --> 24:35.307
-You're friends again?
-Yeah, we're good.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.142
[sighs]

24:37.225 --> 24:40.353
El, you've been acting really weird.
What's going on?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.814
Okay, so the thing is,

24:42.898 --> 24:46.234
I am graduating in two days.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.986
-What?
-Yeah.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.614
So it'll just be the two of you
for the spring.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.616
[uplifting music playing]

24:52.699 --> 24:53.783
Surprise.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.285
Why are you graduating early?

24:55.368 --> 24:58.413
I really heard you guys
when we were at Princeton.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.123
I have to be an actor.

25:00.916 --> 25:05.045
And since Juilliard made it clear
that I'm not going to a conservatory,

25:05.128 --> 25:07.756
I wanna start my professional career now.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.342
So you're just done with school?

25:10.425 --> 25:12.511
Yeah. You're looking at a working woman.

25:13.136 --> 25:17.057
Well, I have to book a job first,
but you're looking at a pre-working woman.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.142
[uplifting music playing]

25:20.268 --> 25:23.104
Okay then. Congratulations.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.689
Wow, you're graduating.

25:24.773 --> 25:25.815
Yeah! [laughs]

25:25.899 --> 25:29.611
[Devi] So Fabiola got into Princeton,
and Eleanor's graduating early,

25:29.694 --> 25:32.489
and I did eventually untangle
all of those lane buoys.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.450
So… [clicks tongue]
…all in all, things are decent.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.244
Are they?

25:39.412 --> 25:40.288
Mmm.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.498
Devi?

25:42.249 --> 25:43.583
[clicks tongue, inhales]

25:43.667 --> 25:46.670
I just can't shake off how bummed I am
that Princeton deferred me.

25:47.295 --> 25:51.466
I hear you, but remember,
getting deferred isn't such a bad thing--

25:51.550 --> 25:53.927
Why do people keep saying that to me?

25:54.010 --> 25:55.428
Getting deferred is a bad thing.

25:55.512 --> 25:58.139
It means they're not sure about me.
They're not sure I'm good enough.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.183
But do you think you're good enough?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.727
Honestly, I don't know anymore.

26:03.478 --> 26:06.147
I mean, right now I feel pretty mediocre.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.108
My own mother assumed
I was gonna get rejected.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.444
-Stop. You know I don't believe that.
-[sighs]

26:11.528 --> 26:16.866
Devi, if this Princeton dream
has so much power over your self-worth,

26:17.659 --> 26:20.829
have you ever considered
that maybe it's not serving you?

26:20.912 --> 26:23.290
[sentimental music playing]

26:24.124 --> 26:27.669
Wow, Devi, first grade.
Pretty soon you'll be going to college.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.922
-Have you thought about where you'd go?
-Princess College.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.883
Hmm. Don't know
if there's a Princess College.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.011
But there's a Princeton College.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.554
'Kay, I'll go there.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.389
Number one school in the country.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.808
-Aiming high, Devi. I'm impressed.
-[giggles]

26:41.891 --> 26:44.352
I'm glad we came up with this plan
before the bus came.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.937
[both chuckle]

26:47.272 --> 26:48.481
[sighs]

26:48.565 --> 26:52.402
Well, I don't think I'm ready
to give up on that dream quite yet.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.573
Kamala.

26:56.656 --> 26:57.532
Hey.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.493
I could've sworn you heard me yell to you
in the lab before you rushed off.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.830
Nope. Definitely not avoiding you
or anything.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.790
What's up? Any fun weekend plans?

27:05.874 --> 27:10.003
Uh, yes, I'm packing up my house
to move across the country.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.255
Have you given
any more thought to my offer?

27:13.340 --> 27:14.466
I have. [sighs]

27:15.091 --> 27:16.926
It's an incredible opportunity,

27:18.053 --> 27:20.513
but I just don't think
that I could move to Baltimore.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.766
My family needs me too much here.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.477
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

Are you sure?

-Yes, they are.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.051
Hmm.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.304
Please come in.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.849
[sighs] Listen,
I'm sorry I've seemed so negative,

28:04.933 --> 28:07.018
or like I don't believe in you.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.187
That couldn't be farther from the truth.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.440
Devi, I've just lived longer
than you have,

28:12.524 --> 28:16.861
and I know that sometimes,
you can work incredibly hard for something

28:16.945 --> 28:19.155
and things just don't go your way,
you know?

28:20.448 --> 28:23.159
I was the top resident
in my program in India,

28:23.243 --> 28:25.161
but when I got here, no one cared.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.205
I had to start the whole process
over again.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.415
That blows.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.333
It did blow. I was devastated.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.127
I ate a whole KFC family meal…

28:32.210 --> 28:34.254
-Uh--
-…and I'm vegetarian.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.005
Damn, Mom, that's dark.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.632
[laughs] I know.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.052
Listen, I wasn't trying to jinx you.

28:41.136 --> 28:45.640
I was just trying to, I guess, protect you
from that kind of disappointment.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.435
But I absolutely 100% believe in you,

28:48.518 --> 28:50.895
and I think Princeton
is really, really stupid

28:50.979 --> 28:53.732
for not snatching you up
first opportunity they got.

28:54.691 --> 28:55.775
Thanks, Mom.

28:55.859 --> 28:58.445
All I wanted to hear
was that Princeton's stupid.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.613
-It's very stupid.
-[Devi chuckles]

29:02.907 --> 29:04.701

Even when things don't work out,
they usually do work out.

[inhales deeply]

29:14.669 --> 29:15.545
Hmm.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.556
Hey. Heard about Princeton.

29:26.639 --> 29:29.142
[sighs] Yeah, it stoinks,

29:29.225 --> 29:31.478
but I know, I know,
deferral isn't that bad.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.814

Oh. I'm sorry.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.245
Yeah, I guess we both took an L this week.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.457

I'll, uh, see you after winter break.
