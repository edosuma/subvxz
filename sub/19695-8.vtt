00:00.500 --> 00:02.201
Previously on "Shades of Blue"...

00:02.203 --> 00:03.502
You think we got a shot
at joint custody here?

00:03.504 --> 00:05.386
I'm not the only one that got this.

00:05.447 --> 00:06.613
She's an escort.

00:06.682 --> 00:08.106
- What's your name?
- Harlee.

00:08.173 --> 00:09.449
You called her by my name.

00:09.518 --> 00:11.262
What profile does that fit?

00:11.287 --> 00:12.554
Obsession.

00:12.668 --> 00:14.067
Wozniak isn't the informant.

00:14.136 --> 00:16.136
- I am.
- I have lost track

00:16.204 --> 00:18.705
of what it means to wear that.
I need some time away.

00:18.774 --> 00:20.807
Donnie's dead.

00:20.876 --> 00:21.808
It was self-defense.

00:21.877 --> 00:23.910
We all have to carry our own sins...

00:25.914 --> 00:27.981
- Or bury them.
- Tell me what 574S

00:28.050 --> 00:30.250
has to do with Detective Saperstein.

00:30.319 --> 00:32.418
You botched this operation, Agent Stahl,

00:32.488 --> 00:33.531
and then you have sex with me

00:33.555 --> 00:35.662
already knowing I'd be your fall guy.

00:36.658 --> 00:37.738
We stick to the assignment.

00:37.786 --> 00:39.749
Julia Ayres got my partner killed.

00:39.818 --> 00:42.327
Bianchi took it as a personal challenge.

00:42.352 --> 00:43.885
There's gonna be blood.

00:43.954 --> 00:46.154
They say there's
a bullet waiting for us all.

00:46.223 --> 00:48.816
You tell Ayres I can call hers in.

00:48.885 --> 00:50.925
You force me to make an enemy tonight.

00:50.994 --> 00:52.434
You and I have different priorities.

00:52.462 --> 00:54.329
Good luck to you, Harlee.

Julia.

01:13.316 --> 01:14.749
Julia, are you hit?

01:20.323 --> 01:22.457
NYPD. Give me some space.

01:26.396 --> 01:28.529
Is the councilwoman the only target?

01:28.598 --> 01:31.099
Is Bianchi going after anyone else?

02:06.177 --> 02:08.776
Councilwoman Ayres
is secured on the scene.

Repeat, this is a report of shots fired.

Shooter's dead.

Croatian national here
on a tourist visa.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.096
Interpol's checking
for any known affiliations.

02:27.164 --> 02:30.935
We both know who set this up.
He just contracted it out.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.354
- And missed.
- This time.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.837
Bianchi must think I'm the one
who put the Feds onto him.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.972
Woz is out looking for him right now.

02:39.307 --> 02:42.411
Harlee, I don't know how we got here.

02:42.843 --> 02:46.815
I would give anything
to go back to start.

02:47.605 --> 02:48.851
Yeah.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.242
Me too.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.880
Yes, come in.

02:55.949 --> 02:57.521
The press pool is gathering.

02:57.821 --> 02:59.367
Are you sure you don't need
anything else, ma'am?

02:59.391 --> 03:01.097
No, I'm fine, Austin.
Just, put those there,

03:01.121 --> 03:03.221
and tell 'em we'll be down in five.

03:03.289 --> 03:04.489
Thank you.

03:06.092 --> 03:07.327
Yeah.

03:08.326 --> 03:10.751
I think we should keep you
in the blue family.

03:11.831 --> 03:15.933
Well, you can't go on camera
with blood on you.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.747
I came here as your friend, all right?

03:17.771 --> 03:19.270
Not as a stage prop.

03:19.339 --> 03:21.851
Like it or not, this is
the biggest story in New York.

03:21.899 --> 03:23.398
Hell, it's even gone national.

03:23.467 --> 03:25.334
Either you address the media tonight

03:25.402 --> 03:28.236
or you address them
on your front stoop tomorrow.

03:28.305 --> 03:29.797
It's your choice.

03:33.310 --> 03:35.610
Hey, I got a call my brother was here.

03:35.679 --> 03:37.346
- Wallace Tufo?
- You're the NYPD officer?

03:37.414 --> 03:39.214
Yeah, that's me.

03:39.283 --> 03:41.116
How bad is he?

03:47.128 --> 03:48.890
Who did this?

03:48.959 --> 03:50.815
- Forget about it.
- No, I get a call

03:50.855 --> 03:54.529
that the only family I got left
is busted up in the hospital,

03:54.976 --> 03:57.247
I'm gonna find out who put him there.

03:58.552 --> 03:59.901
Quince.

04:00.594 --> 04:02.704
Shot caller on Astoria.

04:03.047 --> 04:04.706
Wallace, I left you alone for six hours

04:04.775 --> 04:06.141
and you already back to running?

04:06.210 --> 04:08.119
I had a debt to pay.

04:08.672 --> 04:10.278
Drive a car from here to there.

04:10.865 --> 04:13.124
Old lady runs a red, T-bones me.

04:13.338 --> 04:14.843
Car was hot, so I had to ditch it.

04:14.912 --> 04:17.206
Couple hours later,
Quince and his boys found me.

04:17.274 --> 04:18.418
That's the last thing I remember.

04:18.442 --> 04:21.144
You've been out for one damn day.

04:21.212 --> 04:23.079
I stood up for you, Wallace.

04:23.148 --> 04:24.905
I owed the man.

04:25.617 --> 04:28.851
He kept me safe on the inside.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.753
Protection ain't free.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.669
Marcus...

04:37.618 --> 04:38.995
leave it be.

04:39.603 --> 04:41.364
I got an off-the-books situation.

04:41.433 --> 04:42.897
You turned in your badge.

04:42.951 --> 04:44.477
Everything's off-the-books with you.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.119
We're carrying heavy in the a.m.

04:46.188 --> 04:48.121
- On who?
- Some son of a bitch

04:48.190 --> 04:50.924
that has it coming,
and I need all the party favors.

04:50.993 --> 04:52.259
Can you hook me up?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.899
Jack Russell's a fine animal.

05:02.671 --> 05:06.444
Not the biggest,
but they got a lot of spirit.

05:08.328 --> 05:10.647
You pit one of them against a Rottweiler

05:10.715 --> 05:14.481
or German Shepherd,
they'll fight to the death

05:14.550 --> 05:16.016
just to be the alpha.

05:16.085 --> 05:18.852
Must be why Max
took such a liking to you.

05:19.574 --> 05:22.789
You're both all balls, no brains.

05:23.398 --> 05:25.592
I been looking for your boyfriend.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.728
Went to his house,

05:27.796 --> 05:29.599
to his restaurant,

05:29.668 --> 05:31.264
to his clubs.

05:31.894 --> 05:34.468
Where is Mr. Bianchi?

05:35.277 --> 05:36.570
You're him, aren't you?

05:37.470 --> 05:39.806
You're that crazy cop.

05:40.804 --> 05:44.010
I told him a war
with the NYPD was, well...

05:44.726 --> 05:46.192
not a good idea.

05:56.411 --> 05:58.761
He's been pretty good to me.

05:58.829 --> 06:00.308
I don't care. I don't care.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.597
He took care of my dad when he was sick.

06:01.621 --> 06:03.898
I don't care.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.076
Do you mind if, um...

06:12.401 --> 06:13.767
If I have a smoke?

06:20.150 --> 06:21.416
These things will kill you.

06:30.494 --> 06:32.560
Check the clip...

06:32.629 --> 06:34.863
Before you pull the trigger, sweetheart.

06:34.931 --> 06:37.532
Get off me!

06:37.601 --> 06:39.934
- Get off...
- Tell me! Where is he?

06:40.003 --> 06:41.936
I'm just a good lay to him. I'm nothing.

06:42.005 --> 06:44.239
He almost killed
a friend of mine tonight!

06:44.307 --> 06:47.008
Come on, one more lie.

06:47.077 --> 06:49.110
- Tell me one more lie!
- Italy!

06:49.179 --> 06:51.079
Italy! He's in Italy.

06:51.148 --> 06:52.781
He said he needed to lay low
for a while.

06:52.849 --> 06:55.595
The old country?

06:55.664 --> 06:57.364
That's what you're gonna go with?

06:57.606 --> 06:59.339
It's the truth.

07:00.457 --> 07:02.791
Whatever you want, I'll do it.

07:02.859 --> 07:04.692
Please. Please... no, please.

07:11.907 --> 07:15.242
You're lucky I like dogs.

07:35.537 --> 07:36.969
Get on the ground!

07:40.275 --> 07:41.574
Down on the ground! Spread 'em!

07:41.643 --> 07:43.376
On the ground! Let's go!

07:43.445 --> 07:44.445
All the way! Come on.

07:48.216 --> 07:50.116
All right, get him up. Let's move.

08:09.270 --> 08:11.404
Looks like you're planning
on giving somebody

08:11.473 --> 08:13.406
one heck of a wakeup call.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.010
Me too.

08:18.822 --> 08:20.949
Detective Carlos Espada,
I'm Robert Stahl.

08:21.018 --> 08:22.535
I'm with the FBI.

08:22.604 --> 08:23.850
You're under arrest.

09:19.771 --> 09:21.371
Sorry I missed you. Leave a message.

09:21.439 --> 09:25.241
Caddie, it's Harlee again.

09:25.310 --> 09:27.777
Don't disappear on me. Where are you?

09:27.846 --> 09:30.380
Call me as soon as you get this.

09:37.188 --> 09:40.490
Thought we were past
the walk-of-shame phase.

09:40.558 --> 09:43.993
I just have to go debrief
Captain McManus.

09:44.863 --> 09:48.264
I, felt like
you were having bad dreams.

09:50.338 --> 09:52.005
You're not ready to hear my nightmares.

09:52.073 --> 09:53.907
Try me.

09:53.975 --> 09:55.708
I'm not ready to tell you.

09:56.745 --> 09:58.055
After a shooting, it's normal to have

09:58.079 --> 10:00.753
a certain amount of PTSD.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.517
This isn't the first time
I've fired my weapon.

10:04.586 --> 10:06.778
First time you killed someone.

10:14.801 --> 10:16.162
Could we speed this up, man?

10:16.231 --> 10:17.471
I'd like to make my phone call.

10:17.521 --> 10:19.391
That may take awhile, Detective.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.000
Sunday shift.

10:21.069 --> 10:22.936
Limited resources. You understand.

10:23.004 --> 10:25.004
Yeah, no problem.
I'm happy to reschedule.

10:25.073 --> 10:27.051
Well, I'm afraid I can't
help you there, Detective.

10:27.075 --> 10:30.977
You are, welcome
to use mine if you want.

10:31.046 --> 10:33.713
You assaulted a superior
officer with pocket change?

10:33.782 --> 10:35.815
A roll of quarters balled up
in your fist

10:35.884 --> 10:37.850
inflicts some serious hurt.

10:38.601 --> 10:40.646
Can we go back and start
with how you joined the unit?

10:40.670 --> 10:41.969
That is how I joined the unit.

10:42.038 --> 10:43.515
But you're not interested in all that.

10:43.539 --> 10:45.539
You're here to interview our hero cop.

10:47.076 --> 10:48.709
I'm interested in everybody.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.312
A former member of your unit
is running for mayor,

10:51.381 --> 10:53.814
another member prevented
her assassination.

10:53.883 --> 10:55.361
And you're hoping being the boss's son

10:55.385 --> 10:57.018
gets you an exclusive.

10:57.086 --> 10:59.086
I'm hoping you finish your story.

10:59.155 --> 11:00.633
Well, I'd just earned my gold shield,

11:00.657 --> 11:03.758
the Manhattan North Homicide
unit was,

11:03.826 --> 11:06.494
needing some estrogen. Hold on.

11:06.935 --> 11:08.802
Detective Santos' desk.

11:08.871 --> 11:10.604
No, no, no, still not back yet.

11:10.673 --> 11:12.239
I don't know.

11:13.575 --> 11:16.510
Anyway, this first grade detective

11:16.578 --> 11:18.178
offered to take me under his wing,

11:18.247 --> 11:20.013
although he was more tormentor
than mentor.

11:20.082 --> 11:22.249
And then when the jokes
escalated to ass grabbing,

11:22.317 --> 11:27.056
I got fed up, and I filed
a sexual harassment complaint.

11:27.624 --> 11:29.524
Up went the blue wall, and fast.

11:29.593 --> 11:31.560
Tess, did you take
an incoming call for me?

11:31.628 --> 11:34.463
Only from every major news
outlet from here to Tokyo.

11:34.531 --> 11:35.771
Back to work less than 12 hours

11:35.833 --> 11:37.332
after taking out an assassin,

11:37.401 --> 11:39.201
- that is impressive.
- Nate.

11:39.269 --> 11:40.502
Are you here for your dad?

11:40.571 --> 11:43.238
Sort of. Except he doesn't know it yet.

11:43.307 --> 11:44.640
Is the old man working this weekend?

11:44.664 --> 11:46.824
You could have solved that
mystery with one phone call.

11:46.896 --> 11:48.529
I'm writing a piece for the "Post."

11:48.598 --> 11:50.209
I was actually hoping
you'd sit down with me

11:50.233 --> 11:52.933
for an interview.

11:53.002 --> 11:55.569
Exactly what I was trying to avoid.

11:55.638 --> 11:57.371
Gotta warn you, I can be tenacious.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.440
Yeah. Last name Wozniak.

12:01.311 --> 12:03.978
Seriously? Do you not watch the news?

12:04.047 --> 12:05.674
I got a little sidetracked last night.

12:05.706 --> 12:06.891
I didn't realize
you were still on retainer

12:06.915 --> 12:08.182
with this jackoff.

12:08.251 --> 12:10.774
Espada? How did you get this phone?

12:11.081 --> 12:12.213
Where are you?

12:12.282 --> 12:14.582
Hey, wanna hear this or not?

12:14.651 --> 12:15.635
Edge of my seat.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.585
So one night,
he tries to unbutton my jeans.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.732
And you introduced him
to a fist full of Washington's.

12:19.756 --> 12:21.489
And I felt pretty damn good
about it too.

12:21.558 --> 12:23.425
Until I was suspended without pay

12:23.493 --> 12:25.483
pending an official review.

12:26.863 --> 12:28.964
- Something wrong?
- And then one night,

12:29.032 --> 12:31.800
I, was sitting
in my apartment stewing,

12:31.825 --> 12:33.201
and there's a knock at the door,

12:33.226 --> 12:34.414
and I had never met your dad before,

12:34.438 --> 12:36.416
but I'd heard about him,
and he'd heard about me now,

12:36.440 --> 12:38.773
and apparently,
I was the kind of stubborn bitch

12:38.842 --> 12:40.422
he was looking for.

12:41.766 --> 12:43.545
When was the last time you saw Tufo?

12:43.613 --> 12:45.814
A heavily connected dealer in Queens.

12:45.882 --> 12:47.248
Who tuned up your brother.

12:47.317 --> 12:49.050
Yeah, put him in Intensive Care Unit,

12:49.119 --> 12:50.747
and I need to have
a conversation with the man.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.721
Are we arresting him
after this "conversation"?

12:53.270 --> 12:55.971
Well, God knows what kind of
illegal activity we'll find

12:56.040 --> 12:58.440
- on the premises.
- So we wait till tomorrow.

12:58.509 --> 13:00.375
- Go in with a warrant.
- Wallace is on parole.

13:00.444 --> 13:02.778
They could put him back in
just for associating.

13:02.847 --> 13:04.524
I mean, normally,
I'd blaze in with the crew,

13:04.548 --> 13:06.348
except there ain't no crew.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.166
And Espada is MIA.

13:09.386 --> 13:11.220
What constitutes "associating"?

13:11.288 --> 13:14.256
Mike, this is personal. This is family.

13:14.325 --> 13:17.159
This is also dangerous
and I need backup.

13:17.228 --> 13:20.095
Man, I'm asking for your help.
Right now.

13:20.164 --> 13:22.230
All right? Right now.

13:23.367 --> 13:26.101
I would like to extend
my deepest gratitude

13:26.170 --> 13:27.970
to the bravery of the NYPD,

13:28.038 --> 13:31.481
and in particular
to Detective Harlee Santos

13:31.506 --> 13:33.475
whose courage under fire saved my life

13:33.544 --> 13:35.586
and the lives of countless others.

13:35.613 --> 13:37.390
Over a three-point bump
in online polls and rising.

13:37.414 --> 13:39.919
Well, we'll see what kind
of figure she cuts

13:39.944 --> 13:41.677
doing a perp walk on the 11:00 news.

13:41.746 --> 13:44.480
Every step Ayers takes
closer to the mayor's office

13:44.549 --> 13:46.250
makes the burden of proof
that much higher.

13:46.275 --> 13:48.228
In 12 hours, we should have it
straight from her mouth.

13:48.252 --> 13:50.419
You're confident that Wozniak
will finally surrender?

13:50.488 --> 13:52.321
Well, if not,
our sad little guest over there

13:52.390 --> 13:54.857
will be processed and moved to MCC.

13:55.205 --> 13:56.671
Putting a cop in Metro,

13:56.740 --> 13:58.050
you're throwing him in a shark tank.

13:58.074 --> 13:59.766
Let him get eaten.

14:00.443 --> 14:03.344
We'll see how long
Wozniak's crew stands by him.

14:03.413 --> 14:04.479
Where's Stahl keeping him?

14:04.547 --> 14:06.714
Downtown. The FBI detention center.

14:06.783 --> 14:08.416
It had to be the assassination attempt.

14:08.485 --> 14:10.184
He felt Julia slipping away

14:10.253 --> 14:11.430
and he reacted by picking up Espada.

14:11.454 --> 14:12.680
I should have finished him off

14:12.705 --> 14:14.255
when I had my hands around his throat.

14:14.324 --> 14:16.244
- Do we tell the crew?
- Get them more pissed off

14:16.292 --> 14:18.059
and paranoid than they already are?

14:18.128 --> 14:20.027
Let me get Espada first.

14:20.096 --> 14:21.996
You know what that's gonna take.

14:22.065 --> 14:24.098
Stringing Stahl along
wasn't gonna work forever.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.434
Hey, Tufo's not answering.
Do you think he's hot enough

14:26.503 --> 14:28.317
to move against this Quince guy
on his own?

14:28.342 --> 14:30.661
Well, his brother's lying
in Mercy with a cerebral edema,

14:30.730 --> 14:32.425
and he asked Espada for enough weapons

14:32.450 --> 14:34.396
- to fuel a small revolution.
- You know what?

14:34.465 --> 14:37.884
Arrest the dealer
before Tufo gets to him, okay?

14:39.824 --> 14:42.058
Nate. Hey, you okay?

14:42.127 --> 14:43.693
- What happened?
- Nothing.

14:43.761 --> 14:45.862
- I mean, I'm working.
- Is your mom all right?

14:45.930 --> 14:47.797
She's fine, Dad.

14:47.866 --> 14:50.433
I'm writing a freelance on your unit.

14:50.502 --> 14:53.336
How Councilwoman Ayres'
time here saved her life.

14:53.404 --> 14:54.904
Think I can get an interview?

14:54.973 --> 14:56.350
You know, there's nothing
I'd like to do more,

14:56.374 --> 14:57.840
but I just can't do it right now.

14:57.909 --> 14:59.742
I can't. Later?

14:59.811 --> 15:02.879
Scumbags don't keep banker's hours.

15:02.947 --> 15:06.649
My next tattoo.

15:06.718 --> 15:08.308
What, are we gonna pretend we're selling.

15:08.332 --> 15:09.432
Girl Scout cookies?

15:09.487 --> 15:10.841
Be better if we were in uniform.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.788
I'd prefer Espada's arsenal.
Where is he?

15:12.857 --> 15:15.024
Rough night, rougher morning.

15:15.093 --> 15:16.722
He's in no condition to help anyone,

15:16.728 --> 15:18.594
- including himself.
- Drop the weapon!

15:18.663 --> 15:21.164
NYPD. I'd listen to him, sweetheart.

15:21.232 --> 15:23.933
You got the AK, Karen. Just smoke 'em.

15:24.002 --> 15:25.434
- Guns down now!
- Police.

15:25.503 --> 15:27.714
- On the floor!
- Put 'em down!

15:27.783 --> 15:29.226
We've already been through that part.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.658
You're in no position
to be laying out terms, hero.

15:31.732 --> 15:33.376
Maybe you ain't notice,
but baby girl here's packing

15:33.400 --> 15:36.501
an automatic. 19 rounds per second.

15:36.570 --> 15:38.236
- Yo, Loman.
- Yeah?

15:38.305 --> 15:41.940
Baby girl blinks,
you drop her ass first.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.909
- Easy, Tufo.
- No need.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.922
Baby girl ain't gonna light up
a room full of cops

15:45.946 --> 15:48.647
with the little man watching,
now, is she?

15:49.175 --> 15:51.850
Adrian, get to your room.

15:51.995 --> 15:53.795
Look, I'm not telling anybody
what to do.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.733
I prefer to lead by example.

15:58.802 --> 16:00.535
Harlee, don't even think about it.

16:06.977 --> 16:08.309
Now you've got a choice.

16:15.961 --> 16:17.768
Let's think about what you do next.

16:18.475 --> 16:20.141
You can waste a bunch of cops,

16:20.210 --> 16:22.143
assuming they don't waste you back,

16:22.212 --> 16:23.934
you spend the rest of your life
in solitary,

16:23.959 --> 16:25.613
or we can have a conversation.

16:25.686 --> 16:28.917
Conversation is his dumb-ass
brother wrecked my delivery car.

16:28.985 --> 16:30.585
Ditched a high-value shipment.

16:30.654 --> 16:32.477
- Where's the car now?
- Where you think?

16:32.546 --> 16:34.856
- The ride was stolen.
- Police impound.

16:35.444 --> 16:38.293
All right, well,
the good news is, we're police.

16:38.361 --> 16:39.928
Why don't you let us help you out.

16:39.996 --> 16:42.515
Can you be more specific, dollface?

16:42.583 --> 16:44.432
We liberate the vehicle,

16:44.501 --> 16:46.234
deliver it to you,

16:46.303 --> 16:48.303
and his brother's debt is paid.

16:50.497 --> 16:52.173
Forever.

16:52.242 --> 16:53.920
Did I have a stroke?
Because it sounds like

16:53.944 --> 16:56.211
you promised to steal a car from NYPD

16:56.279 --> 16:57.757
for the banger
who just tried to kill us.

16:57.781 --> 16:59.548
I say we place an anonymous call.

16:59.573 --> 17:01.694
Make sure SWAT finds a pound
of smack in Quince's bedroom.

17:01.718 --> 17:02.995
And he implicates your brother
for trafficking

17:03.019 --> 17:04.421
before the arrest report is filed.

17:04.445 --> 17:06.242
Is that what you want?
I'm looking for payback.

17:06.266 --> 17:07.630
And you thought you'd get it
by banging through the door

17:07.654 --> 17:09.258
with no badge
and a set of brass knuckles?

17:09.281 --> 17:11.317
Loman had a badge. I was an observer.

17:11.386 --> 17:13.328
Wait, wait, wait.
You turned in your shield?

17:13.396 --> 17:16.196
I'm taking some time to evaluate.

17:16.266 --> 17:17.832
How's day one working out?

17:19.736 --> 17:23.838
Hey, I'm here to see Carlos Espada.

17:23.906 --> 17:25.356
I'm his attorney.

17:25.425 --> 17:27.375
Matt Wozniak, esquire.

17:27.891 --> 17:29.368
You could have
at least worn a suit, Matt.

17:29.392 --> 17:31.292
I wanna talk to him now.

17:31.361 --> 17:33.328
No, not here. There's no visitors here.

17:33.396 --> 17:35.363
Not until he's three hots
and a cot at Metro.

17:35.432 --> 17:37.176
This is what happens when you
don't play ball with me.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.211
The rest of your team gets
to pay for your arrogance.

17:39.235 --> 17:40.935
He doesn't know anything about Julia.

17:41.004 --> 17:42.937
You're drilling a dry hole,

17:43.006 --> 17:44.806
but I'm sure you're used to that by now.

17:44.874 --> 17:46.218
I'm not even looking
for anything from him.

17:46.242 --> 17:47.675
I'm collecting on your debt.

17:47.744 --> 17:48.776
So at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,

17:48.845 --> 17:51.846
Detective Carlos Espada
of the 64th precinct

17:51.915 --> 17:53.881
is going to be arraigned
in U.S. District Court,

17:53.950 --> 17:55.245
and after that,
it's out of both our hands,

17:55.269 --> 17:56.525
so you should start looking
at group rates

17:56.549 --> 17:58.286
- on a really good lawyer.
- Yeah?

17:58.355 --> 18:00.788
And you're never gonna get
who you're really after.

18:00.857 --> 18:02.123
I'm not getting her now.

18:02.192 --> 18:04.292
So that's it. It's over.

18:04.361 --> 18:05.994
I know it's hard playing the martyr

18:06.062 --> 18:07.406
when you're inflicting all this damage

18:07.430 --> 18:09.464
on everybody around you. So go ahead.

18:09.532 --> 18:11.662
You protect one lousy whore for the mob.

18:12.435 --> 18:14.969
Or... you wear the wire.

18:15.038 --> 18:17.472
You get Councilwoman Ayres on record

18:17.540 --> 18:18.706
and you deliver it to me.

18:18.775 --> 18:20.842
Not in a week, not in a month,

18:20.910 --> 18:22.950
but soon enough for me
to stop Espada's arraignment.

18:27.884 --> 18:29.817
Your brother really did
a number on this.

18:29.886 --> 18:33.388
Wasn't his fault.
Some senior lady ran a light.

18:34.391 --> 18:36.024
I'm thinking Tess shows up here

18:36.092 --> 18:37.440
in about an hour with a low-cut blouse,

18:37.464 --> 18:39.060
bats her eyes at our friend at the gate

18:39.129 --> 18:40.586
and then asks for help

18:40.633 --> 18:41.995
with a vehicle
on the other side of the lot.

18:42.019 --> 18:44.365
And when officer slick busts a move,

18:44.434 --> 18:46.401
I drive the Civic through the exit.

18:46.469 --> 18:48.369
Close. I drive it out.

18:48.438 --> 18:50.138
Then I drop it off with you and Loman

18:50.206 --> 18:51.773
at the precinct,

18:51.841 --> 18:53.374
and then you can take it to Quince.

18:53.443 --> 18:55.376
Well, it's my brother,

18:55.445 --> 18:57.745
and just because
you crashed Quince's crib

18:57.814 --> 19:00.014
does not mean you get to call the plays.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.561
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
you can head back to the bench.

19:02.585 --> 19:04.385
Okay, coach, but unless you know

19:04.454 --> 19:07.422
how to replace a distributor cap
on a '96 Civic,

19:07.490 --> 19:09.190
this engine's not turning over.

19:09.259 --> 19:11.099
That's gonna make up
for selling out the people

19:11.161 --> 19:15.396
that risked their lives
for you every damn day?

19:15.465 --> 19:17.198
All I've ever cared about

19:17.267 --> 19:19.142
is protecting this family.

19:20.003 --> 19:21.936
Look I shouldn't have lied to you,

19:22.005 --> 19:23.581
and I'm sorry.

19:24.107 --> 19:26.074
- But consider one thing.
- This should be good.

19:26.142 --> 19:27.863
If I hadn't of crashed Quince's,

19:27.888 --> 19:30.311
you'd be a Jackson Pollock
all over his wall right now.

19:34.417 --> 19:37.045
I'll go find you that distributor cap.

19:41.491 --> 19:44.525
You got a gluten-free option
on the menu.

19:46.296 --> 19:48.262
Just took a dump
in front of two meth heads

19:48.331 --> 19:49.508
and you're over here cracking jokes?

19:49.532 --> 19:50.798
This is on you.

19:50.867 --> 19:53.935
Because you're such a choir boy?

19:54.003 --> 19:57.171
You've made choices too, my friend.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.774
I thought you and Harlee
made a deal with the Feds.

19:59.843 --> 20:01.442
- We did.
- But what?

20:01.511 --> 20:03.277
You had to give up a pound of flesh,

20:03.346 --> 20:05.313
- and I was the most disposable?
- What?

20:05.381 --> 20:06.914
You're lucky I can't come over there

20:06.983 --> 20:10.418
and slap that sourpuss
right off your face.

20:12.422 --> 20:15.089
Anyone ever tell you that
you blow at giving pep talks?

20:15.158 --> 20:17.825
Listen, keep your shoulders back.

20:17.894 --> 20:19.460
You're a cop on the inside.

20:19.529 --> 20:22.530
Stop sulking
and don't show any weakness.

20:22.599 --> 20:24.031
They arraign me in the morning.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.845
Even if I beat the charges,
my career's over.

20:25.869 --> 20:29.270
I'm figuring out a play
to get you out of here,

20:29.339 --> 20:33.307
but in the meantime, stand tall.

20:33.376 --> 20:35.376
Figuring out?

20:35.445 --> 20:37.408
As in you don't have one.

20:38.081 --> 20:41.149
You're walking out of here
a free man tomorrow.

20:41.217 --> 20:42.583
You have my word.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.486
Home safe.

20:57.901 --> 21:00.001
Damn it!

21:13.183 --> 21:15.249
Indisputable fact, Harlee.

21:15.318 --> 21:17.785
Nobody knows where
a man's skeletons are buried

21:17.854 --> 21:19.326
like the woman in his life.

21:19.353 --> 21:21.422
That doesn't mean
she has something to say,

21:21.491 --> 21:23.402
and I don't think Stahl
lets people in like that.

21:23.426 --> 21:25.026
He compartmentalizes.

21:25.094 --> 21:26.027
Maybe now.

21:26.095 --> 21:28.196
But there has to be a reason for that.

21:28.264 --> 21:31.199
He didn't turn into a psycho overnight.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.434
You learn how to hide
'cause someone's chasing you.

21:33.503 --> 21:37.038
If anybody knows
who's chasing Stahl, it's her.

21:37.106 --> 21:39.440
Look, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong,
but if I'm right,

21:39.509 --> 21:42.999
we're having Bloody Marys
with Espada tomorrow morning.

21:43.479 --> 21:45.947
I'll punch through
the final bell with you, Woz.

21:46.015 --> 21:48.182
I will, but you have to realize

21:48.251 --> 21:50.117
that Stahl has you locked in a corner.

21:50.186 --> 21:51.885
We're not there yet.

21:52.455 --> 21:54.388
Well, then I think
that you have the best chance

21:54.457 --> 21:55.671
with the former Mrs. Stahl.

21:55.696 --> 21:57.391
I mean, you helped her secure
full custody.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.361
Yeah, but you share a common problem.

22:05.835 --> 22:07.012
We don't want any. I only answered

22:07.036 --> 22:08.536
'cause I have a sick kid napping.

22:08.605 --> 22:10.501
Wait, Marta Stahl?

22:11.274 --> 22:12.988
I owe you an apology.

22:13.509 --> 22:15.973
I'm the woman from the video.

22:17.234 --> 22:18.605
The whore?

22:20.149 --> 22:21.722
I need your help.

22:23.019 --> 22:25.253
I'm worried that he's gonna kill me.

22:32.332 --> 22:34.833
Your ex-husband follows me.

22:35.303 --> 22:36.644
Sometimes every day.

22:36.828 --> 22:37.965
I'll come out of a store,

22:38.034 --> 22:39.938
and he'll just be standing there.

22:40.441 --> 22:42.474
Watching. He doesn't say a word.

22:42.543 --> 22:45.044
He's just taunting me.

22:45.112 --> 22:46.779
Did you call the police?

22:46.847 --> 22:50.616
He looks like an altar boy
and works for the FBI.

22:50.685 --> 22:52.484
How does that play out?

22:53.988 --> 22:55.521
What is it you want from me?

22:59.621 --> 23:01.060
He did that?

23:01.128 --> 23:02.494
And worse.

23:07.201 --> 23:11.537
Winning really matters to Robert.

23:11.606 --> 23:14.867
It's the only reason he wanted
joint custody of Justin.

23:15.390 --> 23:16.609
But he lost.

23:19.246 --> 23:21.201
He lost because of that video.

23:22.450 --> 23:24.083
Are you saying you did me a favor?

23:24.151 --> 23:26.652
I'm... I'm saying that...

23:26.721 --> 23:29.561
that now I need something like that,

23:31.125 --> 23:33.459
and I'm praying that
you can give it to me.

23:35.162 --> 23:36.595
Look, you don't owe me anything,

23:36.664 --> 23:38.530
but I'd appreciate any information

23:38.599 --> 23:41.170
that could give me a fighting chance.

23:42.403 --> 23:44.305
You know, you might have mentioned

23:44.330 --> 23:46.419
that I was a lone badge
before we kicked the door down.

23:46.443 --> 23:48.774
Would it have made a difference?

23:48.843 --> 23:50.376
- Maybe.
- Listen, man.

23:50.444 --> 23:53.212
I'm grateful, all right?
And if you ever need anything,

23:53.280 --> 23:55.447
you just let me know.
I'll be the first one in.

23:55.516 --> 23:56.749
No questions asked.

23:56.817 --> 23:58.717
But you gotta stop pretending

23:58.786 --> 24:00.619
like you're a victim of circumstance.

24:00.688 --> 24:02.588
Nah, I was a victim
of a half-baked plan.

24:02.657 --> 24:04.223
You're a grown man.

24:04.291 --> 24:05.816
You knew what we went there to do.

24:05.884 --> 24:08.293
To take down a criminal.
Not do his work for him.

24:08.362 --> 24:12.197
A man's survival depends
on his ability to adapt.

24:12.266 --> 24:14.366
You could justify just
about anything with that.

24:14.435 --> 24:16.702
Take a stand or get out the way.

24:16.771 --> 24:18.404
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:18.472 --> 24:20.584
But I'm looking at that trunk
before we deliver anything

24:20.608 --> 24:22.074
to that son of a bitch.

24:22.143 --> 24:24.476
Third option.
I send your ass back to church.

24:24.545 --> 24:27.479
- And where is Harlee?
- On assignment.

24:27.548 --> 24:29.581
I'm the designated car thief.

24:29.650 --> 24:31.383
Well, I wasn't looking
to involve you, Woz.

24:31.452 --> 24:34.586
First in a moron-a-thon of misjudgments.

24:34.655 --> 24:36.722
My brother is busted up,

24:36.791 --> 24:38.590
in debt to this drug dealer.

24:38.659 --> 24:40.137
I mean, I didn't have a lot of options.

24:40.161 --> 24:41.560
Nah, you probably wouldn't

24:41.629 --> 24:43.462
when you turn your back on your friends.

24:43.531 --> 24:46.498
Hey, yeah, I got the car.

24:46.567 --> 24:48.667
- What do you got?
- It's still a Hail Mary.

24:48.736 --> 24:50.502
The ex-wife gave me
the name of the woman

24:50.571 --> 24:52.438
at the center of Stahl's career issues.

24:52.506 --> 24:54.606
What, a psychiatrist?

24:54.675 --> 24:56.775
The widow of his dead partner,

24:56.844 --> 24:59.278
the dead partner that
has him so focused on Julia.

24:59.346 --> 25:01.480
The partner killed while undercover?

25:01.549 --> 25:03.282
That's the story.

25:03.350 --> 25:05.390
- Well, what's the address?
- And that's the hiccup.

25:05.419 --> 25:07.453
The widow was offered
witness protection.

25:07.521 --> 25:08.921
Witness protection?

25:08.989 --> 25:10.289
What the hell did she do?

25:10.357 --> 25:11.668
I guess when your husband gets whacked

25:11.692 --> 25:12.869
while undercover with the mafia,

25:12.893 --> 25:14.071
the Bureau offers you protection.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.462
Witsec is more than a hiccup.

25:16.530 --> 25:18.664
I mean, we have less than 16 hours.

25:18.733 --> 25:20.799
Where do we even get started?

25:20.868 --> 25:22.301
I think I might know.

25:22.369 --> 25:23.680
- You're telling me that?
- You can't just...

25:23.704 --> 25:25.637
Ours is not the only house divided.

25:25.706 --> 25:26.850
Let me remind you why we're here.

25:26.874 --> 25:28.474
- Why we... okay.
- We're stealing a car

25:28.542 --> 25:29.641
from police impound

25:29.710 --> 25:31.477
- for a drug dealer!
- Shh.

25:31.545 --> 25:32.478
All in a day's work for this unit.

25:32.546 --> 25:33.752
Or an hour and a half.

25:33.821 --> 25:34.925
Okay. We're doing this one thing for me.

25:34.949 --> 25:36.026
We're looking in the trunk.

25:36.050 --> 25:37.883
It's a shipment of Rolexes
for all we know.

25:37.952 --> 25:39.818
Or a shipment of guns. Or a dead body.

25:39.887 --> 25:41.353
Well, we're never gonna find out

25:41.422 --> 25:42.566
'cause I'm not gonna open
the damn thing.

25:42.590 --> 25:43.870
So you don't care who gets hurt?

25:44.249 --> 25:47.389
Of course he does.
Especially if it's his brother.

25:47.862 --> 25:50.062
Who all of a sudden
canonized you, Loman?

25:50.131 --> 25:52.498
I just wanna do the job
that I signed up for.

25:52.566 --> 25:53.566
We're a team!

25:54.122 --> 25:56.235
We're supposed to be looking out
for each other.

25:56.303 --> 25:58.837
If that's broke,
then nothing else works.

25:58.906 --> 26:00.873
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

26:00.941 --> 26:02.975
If people get hurt
in service of our needs,

26:03.043 --> 26:04.510
then we're the broken ones.

26:04.578 --> 26:07.375
You really think you're better than us?

26:08.649 --> 26:12.200
Let me remind you of something.
I saved your ass.

26:12.586 --> 26:15.587
I saved your ass twice.
Covering up my mistake,

26:15.656 --> 26:17.080
an honest mistake,
that was you saving me?

26:17.104 --> 26:18.568
What do you mean "an honest mistake"?

26:18.592 --> 26:19.525
You killed a man.

26:19.593 --> 26:23.562
You killed a man and you're still a cop.

26:23.631 --> 26:26.398
When was the second time, Woz?

26:26.467 --> 26:27.758
Tell me. When was it?

26:27.827 --> 26:29.434
'Cause I forget.
You know, don't tell me.

26:29.503 --> 26:30.503
Tell them.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.573
You can whine,

26:34.642 --> 26:36.408
you can sulk,

26:36.477 --> 26:37.794
you can lecture,

26:37.848 --> 26:40.412
you can make all the judgments you want.

26:40.481 --> 26:43.882
It doesn't change the fact
that you're a dirty cop.

26:45.386 --> 26:49.588
Ever since you killed
that unarmed black man

26:49.657 --> 26:51.557
and lied about it,

26:51.625 --> 26:53.858
you became a dirty cop.

26:56.964 --> 26:58.501
Detective Loman?

26:59.533 --> 27:01.500
Are you Detective Loman?

27:01.569 --> 27:03.702
- Who's asking?
- I'm Nate Wozniak.

27:03.771 --> 27:05.904
I'm Matt's son.

27:05.973 --> 27:07.848
That's some bad luck.

27:08.642 --> 27:11.343
I'm interviewing his crew
for a news article.

27:12.713 --> 27:13.846
Can you spare a few minutes?

27:16.550 --> 27:18.617
New guy on the squad?

27:18.686 --> 27:19.952
You still learning the ropes?

27:20.020 --> 27:22.244
You know, some days I feel like

27:22.312 --> 27:24.389
I'll never get a full grasp.

27:24.458 --> 27:25.591
Yeah.

27:25.659 --> 27:27.440
You okay if I record this?

27:27.828 --> 27:29.328
Why not?

27:29.396 --> 27:31.597
Okay.

27:31.665 --> 27:33.866
I don't want this
to be a puff piece.

27:33.934 --> 27:35.500
I'd love some texture.

27:35.569 --> 27:38.437
Interesting cases, unusual stories.

27:38.505 --> 27:40.472
Warts and all.

27:40.541 --> 27:42.007
Can you think of any?

27:43.544 --> 27:45.999
Well, there's the two murders
your dad covered up.

27:46.647 --> 27:49.982
Or the multimillion-dollar heist
of federal money

27:50.050 --> 27:52.784
he orchestrated with a missing
Internal Affairs officer.

27:55.155 --> 27:57.489
Why don't we just start with
where the bodies are buried.

27:57.558 --> 27:59.524
Burned.

27:59.593 --> 28:01.627
Not buried.

28:08.035 --> 28:09.768
You really don't know your dad, do you?

28:16.436 --> 28:18.470
The tikka masala and a side of dal.

28:22.311 --> 28:25.244
Intimidation of a federal
officer is a class C felony.

28:25.313 --> 28:27.811
We just wanna have
a conversation with you.

28:27.871 --> 28:29.871
Thanks, but I prefer my own company.

28:29.940 --> 28:32.707
I imagine it gets lonely
when you're the scapegoat.

28:32.776 --> 28:34.181
You disappeared right after

28:34.206 --> 28:36.978
the FBI heist investigation
went sideways.

28:37.047 --> 28:38.313
Your skill sets do extend

28:38.381 --> 28:40.148
beyond extortion and grand larceny.

28:40.217 --> 28:42.951
What backwater place

28:43.019 --> 28:45.728
did the FBI ditch your career in?

28:46.389 --> 28:48.156
Mail fraud.

28:48.225 --> 28:49.791
And you have until dispatch answers

28:49.859 --> 28:51.292
to convince me not to report you.

28:51.361 --> 28:53.127
Molly, we have a serious problem.

28:53.196 --> 28:54.508
This is Agent Molly Chen.

28:54.535 --> 28:55.808
Violent Crime desk,
Brooklyn-Queens, please.

28:55.832 --> 28:57.966
It's Stahl. He's unstable.

28:58.034 --> 29:00.335
He's become obsessed with me
and none of us feel safe.

29:00.403 --> 29:02.103
You've met his boss. File a complaint.

29:02.172 --> 29:04.405
The Feds don't care
how the sausage is made.

29:04.474 --> 29:07.942
- They just want the results.
- They're transferring me now.

29:08.011 --> 29:10.345
Molly, we watched him kill a man

29:10.413 --> 29:13.086
right in front of us, cold blood.

29:14.050 --> 29:16.117
You've got that tinge
in the pit of your stomach

29:16.186 --> 29:18.686
because you've seen flashes
of what I'm talking about.

29:18.755 --> 29:20.455
The ego, the recklessness,

29:20.523 --> 29:22.190
the sadism.

29:22.259 --> 29:23.858
Stahl's dead partner,

29:23.927 --> 29:26.794
his wife is in
the witness protection program.

29:26.863 --> 29:28.429
We need to talk to her.

29:28.498 --> 29:30.698
Witsec files are sealed and top secret.

29:30.767 --> 29:32.033
But not if you have clearance.

29:32.102 --> 29:33.112
Which I don't. Not anymore.

29:33.136 --> 29:35.870
Well, maybe you know somebody who does.

29:35.939 --> 29:37.939
Even if I could pry one open,
it's a federal crime.

29:38.008 --> 29:39.874
Look, Stahl doesn't even feel like a man

29:39.943 --> 29:41.976
unless he's manipulating a woman.

29:42.045 --> 29:44.846
He crawls inside your head
to all the places you feel safe,

29:44.914 --> 29:46.538
and he takes them.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.627
But you know that
because he's done it to you.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.787
You're right, Harlee.

29:52.856 --> 29:55.189
He's cutthroat and erratic,

29:55.258 --> 29:57.892
which is exactly why
I don't want back on his radar.

29:57.961 --> 30:00.228
Duck and cover. The FBI way.

30:00.297 --> 30:01.963
We're not gonna mention your name.

30:02.032 --> 30:04.999
But Stahl's getting
more cutthroat by the hour.

30:05.068 --> 30:07.793
You need to help us stop him.

30:09.839 --> 30:12.929
Molly, if we don't stand up to him,

30:13.610 --> 30:15.977
nobody else will.

30:16.046 --> 30:17.912
You ever approach me again,

30:17.981 --> 30:20.048
I'll call Gail Baker directly.

30:22.719 --> 30:24.919
We pull the transport over.

30:24.988 --> 30:27.088
We say that we're U.S. marshals,

30:27.157 --> 30:29.562
and that we made a mistake.

30:29.993 --> 30:31.759
And then we just pull Espada out,

30:31.828 --> 30:34.057
and... and then we just take him.

30:34.931 --> 30:36.564
What? It worked for Rossi.

30:36.633 --> 30:37.991
You have that friend,

30:38.084 --> 30:39.867
that counterfeiter.
She owes you a favor.

30:39.936 --> 30:42.403
Just get her to make us some badges.

30:45.809 --> 30:47.431
What do you really wanna do?

30:48.011 --> 30:49.577
Woz, look at me.

30:49.646 --> 30:51.671
You gotta make a decision.

30:52.182 --> 30:54.515
You said it yourself,
we don't do something now,

30:54.584 --> 30:55.983
Espada's done.

30:58.855 --> 31:01.222
Everything that Julia's done for us?

31:01.291 --> 31:02.796
I understand.

31:03.493 --> 31:06.427
But just so you understand that
not making a choice is a choice.

31:06.496 --> 31:09.931
I-I can't choose to be a rat.

31:09.999 --> 31:13.534
Just like I can't choose
to... to breathe underwater.

31:13.603 --> 31:14.969
That's just not gonna happen.

31:15.038 --> 31:17.472
We've reached the last stop on the line.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.607
Wh... what's this "we"?

31:19.676 --> 31:21.876
You made your deal.
You're free and clear.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.911
So why don't you just go, and I'll...

31:23.980 --> 31:25.613
Because I love you!

31:25.682 --> 31:28.883
And selfishly, I want us all together.

31:28.952 --> 31:30.151
You, me,

31:30.220 --> 31:32.913
Espada, Tess, Tufo.

31:33.623 --> 31:35.519
Safe.

31:36.126 --> 31:38.186
And whole.

31:47.370 --> 31:49.952
H-how?

31:50.540 --> 31:52.889
How did you do it?

31:53.676 --> 31:56.110
Wear a wire? How do you do that?

31:58.982 --> 32:00.530
Threw up.

32:01.518 --> 32:03.905
I never felt so alone in my life.

32:04.554 --> 32:08.048
But then I reminded myself
what I have to live for,

32:09.192 --> 32:12.627
and I focused on that and nothing else.

32:15.698 --> 32:18.533
You just have to remind yourself
what you have to live for.

32:21.604 --> 32:24.721
I'm not sure anymore.

32:25.408 --> 32:27.687
Look, I won't lie.

32:28.885 --> 32:31.386
It'll be the hardest thing you ever do.

32:31.614 --> 32:34.377
You'll never be able
to look at yourself the same.

32:37.420 --> 32:39.053
It's a terrible choice,

32:39.122 --> 32:40.840
one I don't envy.

32:41.624 --> 32:44.913
But when I look at the scales,
I see them tipped one way.

32:45.361 --> 32:47.565
Now, you may see them different,

32:49.232 --> 32:51.287
but I know what decision I'd make.

34:20.223 --> 34:22.255
Latest numbers. Congratulations.

34:22.324 --> 34:23.925
You just became
the dark horse candidate.

34:53.202 --> 34:54.770
Your debt is paid.

35:15.910 --> 35:18.578
Okay.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.356
Pour it like you mean it.

36:22.617 --> 36:25.017
Detective Harlee Santos.

36:25.086 --> 36:27.620
I have a delivery
for Special Agent Robert Stahl.

36:27.688 --> 36:30.422
Criminal Investigations. Can I help you?

36:32.360 --> 36:33.360
11th hour.

36:33.675 --> 36:36.287
I was already prepping Espada
for transfer.

36:37.198 --> 36:38.559
Where's Wozniak?

36:38.604 --> 36:41.467
- He wasn't up for it.
- That doesn't surprise me.

36:41.535 --> 36:45.270
Even Napoleon was a no-show surrender.

36:45.339 --> 36:47.172
Too proud to hand over
his sword, I guess.

36:47.241 --> 36:50.209
At least he fought his own battles.

36:52.246 --> 36:54.146
So she's on here?

36:54.215 --> 36:56.248
Loud and clear.

36:56.317 --> 36:57.783
Indictable evidence?

36:57.852 --> 36:59.251
You have it.

36:59.665 --> 37:01.720
All right.

37:06.093 --> 37:09.895
Well, I guess now that Wozniak
has fulfilled his contract...

37:12.266 --> 37:14.566
Our relationship is going
to have to evolve into something

37:14.635 --> 37:16.468
a little more civil.

37:16.537 --> 37:18.407
It's not a relationship

37:18.436 --> 37:20.603
if only one person has a choice in it.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.139
You always had a choice, Harlee.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.909
You just didn't make
the right choice until now.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.710
We can finally agree on something.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.339
I appreciate you talking to me.

37:56.917 --> 37:58.374
You were there?

37:58.443 --> 38:00.133
Hard place to find.

38:00.158 --> 38:03.112
I always knew someone would come asking.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.814
Who told you about us?

38:04.883 --> 38:06.149
Robert's ex-wife.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.918
Robert tried to convince me
that she didn't know.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.554
- She knew.
- An affair?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.089
Yes.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.024
She's in witness protection.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.626
I am a very good detective.

38:17.019 --> 38:18.485
And that's what you knew

38:18.554 --> 38:20.021
someone would come asking about?

38:20.879 --> 38:23.311
I knew someone would come asking about

38:23.380 --> 38:25.480
how Robert got my husband killed.

38:31.588 --> 38:32.732
I thought you enjoyed eavesdropping

38:32.756 --> 38:35.156
on my conversations.

38:35.225 --> 38:37.458
She is not well, Harlee.

38:37.527 --> 38:38.927
She doesn't know what she's saying.

38:38.962 --> 38:40.361
I think you should hear her out.

38:40.430 --> 38:43.297
I mean, I traveled all night
to bring that here for you.

38:43.366 --> 38:44.565
I'm sending Espada to Metro.

38:44.634 --> 38:47.101
He'll be arraigned by noon.

38:47.170 --> 38:48.707
I made copies on the train.

39:24.293 --> 39:27.708
Julia Ayres didn't
get your partner killed.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.539
- You did.
- I told you.

39:29.608 --> 39:32.175
Julia Ayres outed my partner,

39:32.244 --> 39:33.810
an FBI agent,

39:33.879 --> 39:35.362
to her mafia benefactor.

39:35.431 --> 39:37.014
Two days after I briefed her,

39:37.082 --> 39:39.049
his tongue showed up here

39:39.118 --> 39:40.627
in a gift-wrapped box.

39:40.652 --> 39:42.197
Only he shouldn't have
still been undercover.

39:42.221 --> 39:45.259
You kept him there because
you were obsessed with his wife.

39:45.328 --> 39:47.441
That had nothing to do with it.

39:47.466 --> 39:49.399
We were on the verge
of the biggest mob bust

39:49.468 --> 39:52.335
- since John Gotti!
- That's not how she puts it.

39:52.404 --> 39:54.404
She says you took advantage,

39:54.473 --> 39:56.973
emotionally manipulated her,

39:57.042 --> 39:59.066
and how she tried to end your affair

39:59.135 --> 40:01.289
when her husband told her he was
punching out of his assignment

40:01.313 --> 40:03.346
and coming home.

40:03.415 --> 40:04.781
The job wasn't done.

40:04.849 --> 40:08.084
Yeah, but you were already hooked,

40:08.153 --> 40:11.287
and you and I both know
nothing gets in between you

40:11.356 --> 40:13.823
and your desires.

40:26.905 --> 40:30.140
You extended your partner's
undercover assignment

40:30.208 --> 40:34.659
over and over again,
playing the sympathetic friend.

40:34.728 --> 40:37.112
Bucking him up and
putting him back in the ring

40:37.181 --> 40:38.367
with no end in sight.

40:38.435 --> 40:40.747
Alan was my friend.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.191
I didn't play anybody.

40:42.260 --> 40:44.290
I didn't play anything,
and he knew the risks!

40:44.358 --> 40:46.425
This isn't just
dressing up some prostitute

40:46.494 --> 40:49.061
and calling her by your asset's name.

40:49.130 --> 40:50.563
This is criminal negligence.

40:50.631 --> 40:53.933
Julia Ayres exposed him.

40:54.001 --> 40:55.334
She is the villain here.

40:55.403 --> 40:57.036
Is that what you tell yourself?

40:57.105 --> 40:58.797
Because somewhere
underneath all that rage

40:58.866 --> 40:59.872
and twisted passion,

40:59.941 --> 41:01.622
there's a real person
trying to reconcile

41:01.691 --> 41:03.409
what happened to his partner.

41:03.478 --> 41:06.846
My arrest, getting Wozniak,

41:06.914 --> 41:08.714
pursuing Ayres,

41:09.165 --> 41:10.097
it's not vengeance.

41:10.166 --> 41:14.401
You screwed us
so you could save yourself!

41:14.470 --> 41:15.759
Make a call.

41:16.079 --> 41:19.028
I want Espada out
by the time I get downstairs.

41:19.709 --> 41:21.375
And then I never hear from you again.
