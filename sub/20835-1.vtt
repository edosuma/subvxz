02:30.418 --> 02:32.486
Oh!

02:36.156 --> 02:38.492
- Myles?
- What?

02:38.559 --> 02:41.995
What's that horrible sound?

02:42.062 --> 02:44.565
What-

02:44.632 --> 02:46.567
Blue jay.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.436
Why?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.971
Giving his wife hell.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.574
That beautiful thing?

02:53.641 --> 02:56.844
She let the cat into the garden.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.879
Oh.

03:04.051 --> 03:07.788
- Love, love, love?
- Love, love, love.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.293
Mmm.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.595
Myles!

03:14.662 --> 03:17.130
I'm asleep.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.667
Mmm!

03:19.733 --> 03:21.669
What time is it?

03:27.641 --> 03:30.311
It's either a quarter to 4:00
or 20 after 9:00.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.789
Oh!

03:47.961 --> 03:51.465
Darling, would you mind
answering the phone?

03:53.767 --> 03:56.570
There's no reason to be scared.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.518
- Whom am I speaking to?
- It's me- Abby.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.253
May I speak to Mr. Clarkson?

04:13.321 --> 04:16.423
Oh. Well, you see, Myles is asleep.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.892
So is Paula.
They're both asleep.

04:18.959 --> 04:23.063
They're always sleeping.
Who shall I say called?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.198
Duncan Ely.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.368
Wait just a minute.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.474
Would you mind spelling that for me?

04:34.375 --> 04:40.113
D- U-N...

04:40.180 --> 04:45.152
C- A-N.

04:45.218 --> 04:50.858
E- L-Y.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.632
Myles! Myles!

05:01.769 --> 05:04.237
You forgot your tape recorder.
I love you.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.374
You mean you love me anyway.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.223
- Yes?
- Myles Clarkson. I have an appointment.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.358
Oh, yes, of course.
Will you come this way, please?

05:58.426 --> 06:00.528
May I help you?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.366
You'll have to wait until
Mr. Ely's through playing.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.602
Oh, yes.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.792
We can go in now.
This way, please.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.036
- Clarkson?
- Yes, sir.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.139
I let you come because I read your
piece on that Russian genius-

06:46.206 --> 06:48.542
- What's his name?
- Stravinski.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.879
Yes. It wasn't good,
but it wasn't too bad either.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.014
Well, thank you.

06:55.382 --> 06:59.119
Did you recognize the piece
I just played?

06:59.186 --> 07:01.254
Late Romantic.
Liszt, I think.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.792
Not a bad guess.
"Mephisto Waltz."

07:04.858 --> 07:07.094
The devil dancing with his paramours.

07:09.062 --> 07:12.132
All right, I give you 30 minutes,
no more.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.773
Oh, throw that
disgusting cylinder away!

07:35.422 --> 07:38.191
Mr. Clarkson.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.998
May I see your hands?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.503
Turn it over.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.608
Now the other one.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.214
Stretch your fingers.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.264
Have you ever played the piano?

08:18.566 --> 08:20.534
I studied for four years at Juilliard.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.539
And?

08:25.606 --> 08:28.676
I had the usual first concert.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.311
Half family and half critics.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.347
I got a standing ovation,
then seven New York City reviews.

08:34.414 --> 08:38.586
The kindest phrase
I remember is "indecently immature."

08:38.652 --> 08:41.354
I resented that.
I was 20 years old.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.725
Critics. Even when they're right,
they're stupid.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.327
They don't understand
that after a concert,

08:47.394 --> 08:50.297
there's blood on the piano keys.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.365
And there should be-

08:52.432 --> 08:56.303
Yes, Bennett. Please ask Mrs. Delancey
to come down here.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.405
Very good, sir.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.909
I want my daughter to see your hands.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.012
Go ahead, please.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.080
Well, for about the next year or so,

09:07.147 --> 09:09.349
I tried to end it all
with the aid of scotch on the rocks.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.986
So you took up the trade
common to retired admirals,

09:13.053 --> 09:16.289
unhappy wives and exhausted poets.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.827
- You became a writer.
- A musical journalist.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.299
Can you stretch a tenth?

09:28.836 --> 09:31.271
No, here at the piano.

09:54.728 --> 09:58.331
Roxanne, he has great hands.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.801
Rachmaninoff hands.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.173
Uh, you-

10:06.239 --> 10:08.308
- I forgot your name.
- Myles Clarkson.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.078
I happen to be
the greatest pianist alive,

10:11.144 --> 10:15.515
and I tell you this,
Mr. Myles Clarkson.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.518
Hands like yours...

10:18.585 --> 10:21.789
are one in a hundred thousand.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.058
Don't you agree, Roxanne?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
Yes.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.360
Our Father is no longer
in heaven, my dear.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.262
- God exists.
- Oh.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.565
- And the devil is his vice president.
- Or is it vice versa?

11:05.632 --> 11:09.536
- Oh, there's a dreadful pun in there somewhere.
- Unintended, my dear.

11:09.602 --> 11:14.074
Roxanne, have you visited,
uh, Kurt's new villa at Cap-Ferrat?

11:14.141 --> 11:17.144
No, darling.I've been spending my
days in South America.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.612
We have this working ranch in Chile.
It's a family thing.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.648
Oh, that's very interesting.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.683
Richard, I saw your last picture.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.319
At least, I hope
that was your last picture.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.790
My dear boy, you really should
make them use doubles for you,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.793
especially in those nude scenes.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.329
Look, I have discovered that the beach
in winter at Coney Island...

11:36.396 --> 11:39.132
is absolutely enchanting,
and no one's discovered it yet.

11:39.199 --> 11:43.270
See, I have an axiom to grind.
ClichÃ© is king.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.372
Now, wouldn't you agree?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.307
No, I don't.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.011
Death. There's nothing
more popular than death.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.646
Death is corny.
It really is.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.017
Absurd, ridiculous and corny.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.888
What were you like as a child?

12:00.954 --> 12:05.325
At Abby's age, I was, um,
beautiful and precocious.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.228
- Hmm.
- And at, say, 17?

12:08.295 --> 12:11.698
- I was merely beautiful.
- You then were still in London?

12:11.765 --> 12:13.767
Why are you so interested in me?

12:15.002 --> 12:17.004
- Aren't you?
- No.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.607
- Why not?
- Well, I know too much.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.513
A gardener who does what?

12:26.579 --> 12:30.383
- Do you know what she said?
- Oh, thank you, but I'm having some terrific wine.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.653
This is really nice.
Thank you, thank you. This is-

12:33.720 --> 12:37.490
You see this callus on my finger?
That just proves one thing-

12:37.557 --> 12:39.026
that my wife does the typing.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.694
I think you should be
an actor or a pianist.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.999
- So the great Duncan tells me.
- He's right. He's always right.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.001
But he's just a little bit
insufferable too.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.437
He's forced me to play
the piano with him this evening.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.439
A duet.

12:52.505 --> 12:55.175
Forgive me, Mozart,
for I know not what I do.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.886
- Congratulations, young man.
- Thank you very much.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.655
- Now I know what Duncan meant.
- Thank you.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.858
- We must discuss your career one of these days.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.294
- How was I? Rotten?
- No. With a lot of work,

14:21.361 --> 14:24.431
- you could become a third-rate piano player.
- Oh, that good, huh?

14:24.497 --> 14:27.634
But, Myles, say you loafed
eight hours a day at your writing.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.004
- You could become a halfway decent novelist.
- I have, and I'm not.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.873
Myles, you're giving me
a horrible headache.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.209
- Let me get you something.
- And I want to go home.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.746
- Good night. Good night, Myles.
- Good night, Roxanne, darling.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.683
- Hope to see you soon.
- Very soon.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.822
Robin, sit!
This is Robin.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.192
Isn't he a beautiful creature?

14:52.259 --> 14:55.095
Robin, I would like you
to meet Mrs. Clarkson.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.020
Oh, shut up.
I'm not a customer.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.660
What time is it?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.799
It's eleven days before Christmas.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.636
You know what
our total sales are, plus sales tax?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.771
No, and I don't want to.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.008
Eleven dollars and 25 cents.

15:44.544 --> 15:48.815
Well, it's a nice neighborhood anyway.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.883
So is the rent.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.687
In five more minutes,
we're gonna close up shop, go home,

15:54.754 --> 15:58.992
serve dinner, write a note of apology
to our dear husbands,

15:59.059 --> 16:01.028
takes 100 sleeping pills...

16:01.094 --> 16:03.030
and hang ourselves
in the upstairs closet.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.499
Let's wait till tomorrow.
I think I see a customer.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.703
Paula. We had to come
and see your boutique.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.473
- Hello, Mr. Ely.
- Hello.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.610
Beautiful.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.481
Um, this is my partner, Maggie West.
Duncan Ely. Mrs. Delancey.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.184
- How do you do? I brought some friends.
- Good.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.619
I wanted your first day
to be a success.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.289
Paula, it's beautiful!

16:29.356 --> 16:31.924
- How much have they bought?
- Over $500.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.394
- What are they after?
- Who cares?

16:34.461 --> 16:38.998
I sold him the Hermes scarf for 29.95, and
he never batted a beautiful white eyelash.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.101
He wants three more.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.204
They're spending too much.
It makes me nervous.

16:44.271 --> 16:47.507
Why are they doing it?
Why?

17:02.389 --> 17:06.292
Duncan Ely.
Now I remember.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.630
His wife was murdered...

17:12.765 --> 17:14.666
by a dog.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.541
Myles.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.912
- Hmm?
- I'm worried.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.515
- Why?
- Because.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.785
Well, there's a good, solid reason.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.126
They spent all that money
in my shop...

17:39.192 --> 17:42.129
to buy ridiculous things.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.396
Who?

17:43.463 --> 17:46.599
Roxanne and her friends and Duncan.

17:46.666 --> 17:50.103
You know he comes in every other day?

17:50.170 --> 17:54.141
Why?
What's the reason?

17:54.207 --> 17:56.209
He likes you.
Is that so frightening?

17:57.477 --> 17:59.346
Yes.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.416
All these questions about you,
about me, about Abby.

18:03.483 --> 18:07.387
He's studying us
like little white mice in a maze.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.424
I don't want to go there
on New Year's eve.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.163
It's too late.
I already said we would go.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.532
Well, call him up and say
you're gonna be ill.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.304
Why can't we do what we always do-

18:24.371 --> 18:27.407
celebrate our crazy Mexican honeymoon?

18:27.474 --> 18:30.877
- Drink tequila and play checkers?
- Yeah, exactly.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.280
Why?

18:33.346 --> 18:36.183
So once a year, at least,
I can let you win.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.752
- The hell you do.
- The hell I don't.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.721
Look, baby.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.159
I really wanna go to that party.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.528
It's important to me.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.631
Then good.
Go by yourself.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.766
What, are you jealous?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.802
Yes.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.505
Of whom?
Mrs. Delancey?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.409
- Well, who else is there?
- Oh, God!

19:08.181 --> 19:10.517
Actually,

19:10.583 --> 19:13.286
anything she can do, I can do.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.357
- Love?
- Love.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.702
Happy New Year!

21:05.197 --> 21:07.534
Oh, how delicious!

21:07.600 --> 21:09.602
If they all looked like you,
I'd switch sexes.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.004
It's nice that you have a choice.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.743
How's my girl?

21:16.809 --> 21:20.413
Oh! Terrible!
I'm stoned, and I hate it.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.948
What's the matter?
Have I got dandruff again?

21:22.014 --> 21:24.417
Myles, I wanna go home
and I wanna go to bed.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.019
Success makes you miserable, doesn't it?

21:29.556 --> 21:31.691
Where are you going?

21:31.758 --> 21:33.693
If I'm not back
in 10 minutes, call the police.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.596
Oh, great!
Thanks very much.

23:36.516 --> 23:40.119
Oh!

23:40.186 --> 23:42.489
There you are, you bad boy.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.757
Hmm?
You bad boy.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.726
Oh, yes.

23:46.793 --> 23:50.530
Oh, you silly dog.
He loves perfume.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.565
You must have frightened him.

23:52.632 --> 23:56.135
He really is
quite a coward, you know.

23:56.202 --> 23:59.438
Now, Robin, lie down.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.274
That's a boy.
Roll over.

24:02.341 --> 24:07.547
That's it. Yes. He's a great big
baby. Aren't you, Robin? Hmm?

24:07.614 --> 24:10.216
He's a lousy hypocrite
is what he is.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.754
- Did you like my work?
- Frankly, no.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.756
I come from a worried generation.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.091
I like nice, safe abstract forms.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.661
Yours are a little too real for comfort.

24:21.728 --> 24:26.398
That's true, and very perceptive.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.769
- I'd love to do a life mask of Myles.
- Why?

24:29.836 --> 24:31.971
His bones,

24:32.038 --> 24:34.807
here and here-

24:34.874 --> 24:37.276
They're so beautiful.
Don't you agree?

24:37.343 --> 24:40.547
No, I don't.
But he is pretty.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.617
It's all right then?
I can do him?

24:44.684 --> 24:46.686
I'm not my husband's keeper.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.932
You see, I was married twice-

24:59.999 --> 25:04.203
once at 15 to an old man almost 30.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.407
Duncan had it annulled.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.309
It cost him lots of money.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.679
Did you always call him Duncan?

25:12.745 --> 25:15.815
I guess I always have called him Duncan.

25:15.882 --> 25:19.318
"Dad" would be entirely too domestic...

25:19.385 --> 25:21.921
and lace-curtain for a man like him.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.158
There were lots of affairs in between.

25:26.225 --> 25:30.196
And then I married once more,
and divorced.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.932
I suppose I should have stayed.
He was such a-

25:32.999 --> 25:37.770
a nice, simple,
rugged, intelligent man.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.274
He's vice president
of Western Oil out here.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.146
Duncan, what's the matter?

25:49.281 --> 25:53.653
Oh, faint.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.924
Just one of those-

25:57.990 --> 26:00.392
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.

26:00.459 --> 26:04.263
Those stairs-

26:04.330 --> 26:06.332
They go round and round.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.836
Your hands, they're ice-cold.
Shall I get your medicine?

26:09.902 --> 26:13.973
No, thank you.
I took it. It- It doesn't help.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.711
I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

26:20.346 --> 26:24.316
You're the one that looks sick.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.919
I expect you'll be better...

26:26.986 --> 26:32.024
as soon as it's peeled off and cast.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.402
People should be born at 70...

26:43.469 --> 26:46.839
and live their lives backward.

26:53.045 --> 26:58.818
The present arrangement
simply doesn't make sense.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.702
- I'm awake.
- Oh.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.206
Have a nice time?

27:54.273 --> 27:57.944
Murder. We- We killed
three bottles of champagne.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.150
With Roxanne?

28:04.216 --> 28:07.219
And Duncan.

28:07.286 --> 28:12.792
Hey, you know somethin'?
He had me play the Mozart again.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.927
And I was pretty good.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.596
Maybe stoned on champagne
is how I ought to live.

28:17.663 --> 28:20.066
Myles, you're broken out with pink.

28:20.132 --> 28:24.703
Oh, that's the- you know, the plaster.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.206
I hate Roxanne.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.475
Naturally.

28:34.313 --> 28:38.050
I don't want to go there anymore,
and I don't want you to go there either.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.922
Why?
Would you just explain to me why?

28:42.989 --> 28:45.157
- Because they're too damn friendly!
- Quiet! Don't shout.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.227
There are some things I can't say
without shouting. Do you mind?

28:48.294 --> 28:51.597
- Look, they like us.
- They like you.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.867
They think- They think Abby is the most
wonderful child in the Western world.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.336
- And they like me too.
- Of course they do.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.572
- But it's all too sudden.
- Baby, what is it? What's the matter?

29:00.639 --> 29:02.508
You know, I mean, really?

29:02.574 --> 29:06.445
- I'm scared.
- That's ridiculous.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.118
I'm- I'm the son he never had.

29:12.184 --> 29:16.488
Oh, fine.
Is he the father you never had?

29:16.555 --> 29:19.658
Myles, may I remind you
that you've already got one father?

29:19.725 --> 29:23.762
He's a druggist in Providence,
Rhode Island. Remember?

29:23.830 --> 29:27.166
Anything more than that
is bigamy or something.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.141
Duncan Ely's dying.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.278
Oh, Myles, no.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.480
Yeah, he told me himself tonight.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.986
He's had leukemia for eight months.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.523
They keep changing his blood every
two weeks, but it doesn't do any good.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.492
He's gonna die.

29:55.995 --> 29:59.065
I'm sorry.
Really, I am.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.367
He told me not to tell anybody,
but I guess it's all right.

30:04.236 --> 30:08.875
He's a great man.
He's a great artist.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.577
He's maybe the greatest
since the invention of the pianoforte.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.949
And he's never gonna give
another concert.

30:27.860 --> 30:31.397
Open up your fist, Mr. Clarkson,

30:31.463 --> 30:34.466
and hold this real tight
for about two minutes.

30:37.236 --> 30:40.172
- How is he?
- Much better, I think.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.175
- Sleeping?
- Yes, very quietly now.

30:43.242 --> 30:47.079
He's got so much courage.
It's an inspiration.

30:47.146 --> 30:50.482
Why don't you go down to the kitchen
and have Bennett get you some supper?

30:50.549 --> 30:52.751
Thank you.
I will.

30:52.818 --> 30:55.321
I'll take that in for you.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.323
All right.

31:06.465 --> 31:10.903
- I brought some hot bouillon for you to drink.
- Oh.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.940
- Go on. It's good for you.
- All right, thank you.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.947
I gave some blood yesterday.

31:21.013 --> 31:25.084
You'll feel tired for an hour or so.
Why don't you take a nap?

31:25.151 --> 31:27.319
Mmm.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.661
When Duncan wakes up, I'll call you.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.530
I know he wants to talk to you.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.532
Yes, do that, please.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.024
Good-bye, Myles.

34:45.951 --> 34:48.719
Is it nearly 12:00?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.723
Almost, Duncan.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.413
Hmm? Myles?

40:18.049 --> 40:20.018
How's Duncan?

40:23.021 --> 40:25.657
Oh.

40:25.724 --> 40:28.694
I'm sorry.
Really, I am.

40:28.760 --> 40:33.565
- Though he had a great life.
- Nobody has enough.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.639
What is it?

40:42.574 --> 40:45.611
That costume.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.679
Oh, the laundry didn't come back.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.483
And I got cold waiting for you.

40:51.550 --> 40:54.185
Just on top, huh?

40:54.252 --> 40:58.123
- No, leave it on.
- Why?

40:58.189 --> 41:00.125
I wanna see you.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.933
Love, love, love?

41:11.770 --> 41:14.806
- Don't be stubborn. Say it.
- What do you mean?

41:14.873 --> 41:16.742
What do you mean, what do I mean?

41:31.256 --> 41:33.892
Do you wanna go downstairs?

41:33.959 --> 41:35.894
No.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.840
Can't we wait?

41:50.208 --> 41:52.110
No, I can't wait.

44:07.145 --> 44:10.048
What was all that mumbo jumbo about?

44:10.115 --> 44:13.284
I expected to see him
rise from the coffin.

44:13.351 --> 44:16.354
People have a right
to their own religion.

44:25.130 --> 44:27.632
"I, Duncan Mowbray Ely,

44:27.699 --> 44:29.534
"a resident of
the city of Los Angeles...

44:29.600 --> 44:32.603
"in the county of Los Angeles
in the state of California,

44:32.670 --> 44:35.240
"being of sound mind
and disposing memory,

44:35.306 --> 44:39.110
"do make, publish and declare
this my last will and testament...

44:39.177 --> 44:42.480
"hereby revoking any
and all wills and codicils...

44:42.547 --> 44:45.717
"thereto by me heretofore made.

44:45.784 --> 44:48.553
"Item one:

44:48.619 --> 44:52.223
"In recognition of my affection
for Myles Clarkson,

44:52.290 --> 44:55.426
"I give, devise and bequeath to him...

44:55.493 --> 45:00.031
"one of my Steinway pianos and my
entire collection of musical scores...

45:00.098 --> 45:03.268
"for his personal enjoyment
and use in the hope that...

45:03.334 --> 45:05.737
"he will continue his interest in music,

45:05.804 --> 45:09.775
"for which I believe
he has such an extraordinary talent.

45:09.841 --> 45:15.013
"Furthermore, I direct
that within one week of my demise,

45:15.080 --> 45:17.715
"my executors pay
to the said Myles Clarkson...

45:17.783 --> 45:20.551
"the sum of $100,000 cash,

45:20.618 --> 45:25.723
such sum to be drawn from
my personal checking account."

45:25.791 --> 45:28.026
Myles, I don't believe it!

45:28.093 --> 45:32.130
"This sum I bequeath
to the said Myles Clarkson...

45:32.197 --> 45:34.599
"for his support and maintenance,

45:34.665 --> 45:40.338
"though it is hoped he will use it to
further his musical career if he so chooses.

45:43.641 --> 45:46.377
"Item two:

45:46.444 --> 45:49.047
"To my daughter, Roxanne Delancey,

45:49.114 --> 45:52.017
"I hereby bequeath my home
in Los Angeles, California,

45:52.083 --> 45:55.453
and all of its contents."

46:25.216 --> 46:27.819
All that money has made you
terribly attractive.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.988
Did you know that?

46:49.774 --> 46:53.011
- Remember me?
- Mmm, no. Not yet.

46:55.346 --> 46:59.117
- What the hell is that?
- There are 42 cathedrals in this town. Remember?

47:01.086 --> 47:04.555
- No.
- Sure you do.

47:04.622 --> 47:06.858
Wait a minute.
Listen to this.

47:10.929 --> 47:14.099
- Now do you remember?
- Turn that damn thing off!

47:14.165 --> 47:17.168
You used to be so polite.

47:17.235 --> 47:19.037
So gentle.

47:19.104 --> 47:21.306
That was last week when I was poor.

47:44.595 --> 47:46.497
Do you love me?

47:54.973 --> 47:57.408
Any fool can love.

47:58.776 --> 48:01.179
It's what comes next that counts.

48:10.989 --> 48:12.890
Oh, Myles!

48:37.748 --> 48:39.750
Robin!

48:39.817 --> 48:42.820
Robin! Robin!

48:42.887 --> 48:45.656
You're a bad dog!

48:45.723 --> 48:48.626
Shame on you!
Come on.

48:50.996 --> 48:53.164
You could have hurt me.

48:53.231 --> 48:57.202
- Now I'll have to tie you up.
- Hi, Abby.

48:57.268 --> 48:59.370
Mommy!

48:59.437 --> 49:02.140
- Oh, I've missed you so much.
- Oh, Mommy!

49:02.207 --> 49:05.143
I'm so glad you're back.

49:05.210 --> 49:08.779
- Oh, look, Mommy. I have a dog.
- So I noticed.

49:08.846 --> 49:11.549
Abby, he's a very beautiful dog,

49:11.616 --> 49:14.952
and you're gonna give him right back to
the beautiful lady who gave him to you.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.422
- No offense.
- Oh, please, Mommy, can't we-

49:17.488 --> 49:19.424
No!

49:29.267 --> 49:31.736
Come on, Robin.
Come on.

49:34.005 --> 49:36.774
Aw.

49:36.841 --> 49:38.743
What?
Tears already?

49:38.809 --> 49:41.012
Yes. Everything's back to normal.
Hello, Maggie.

49:41.079 --> 49:43.748
- Hello, hello.
- How was she?

49:43.814 --> 49:46.917
- Oh, awful.
- Typical.

49:46.984 --> 49:50.688
- Where's the rich man?
- Parking the rich car.

49:50.755 --> 49:53.024
Happy vacation?

49:53.091 --> 49:56.394
Mad.

49:56.461 --> 49:59.230
It can't go on.

49:59.297 --> 50:02.167
Actually, I feel unfaithful.

50:02.233 --> 50:04.702
He's like three different men.

50:04.769 --> 50:06.804
- Is that a new ring?
- Loot.

50:06.871 --> 50:09.006
Ooh, let me see.

50:09.074 --> 50:10.841
He wants Daddy.

50:10.908 --> 50:13.311
Don't we all?

50:13.378 --> 50:15.313
Daddy will let me have him.

50:15.380 --> 50:18.149
You'll see.

50:18.216 --> 50:21.152
Hello, pretty girl.

50:21.219 --> 50:25.556
Oh, Daddy! Daddy!

50:25.623 --> 50:27.558
Daddy, listen to me.

50:27.625 --> 50:31.129
I want this dog real bad.
I'll keep him in my room.

50:31.196 --> 50:34.199
Oh, please? And he won't eat
your pencils anymore.

50:34.265 --> 50:36.834
- I promise!
- Pencils?

50:36.901 --> 50:38.836
Did you let him into Daddy's study?

50:38.903 --> 50:42.873
When I first met this dog, I
disliked him. But now that's all changed.

50:42.940 --> 50:46.544
- Little by little, I've grown to hate him.
- We'll keep him.

50:46.611 --> 50:49.147
Oh, no, Myles.
I don't want a dog in the house.

50:49.214 --> 50:51.849
- A dog needs a child.
- Oh, thank you, Daddy.

50:51.916 --> 50:56.654
- Mmm!
- I still smell tobacco. Open the window, will you?

50:56.721 --> 51:01.626
- It's already open.
- If that's a martini, I want a taste.

51:01.692 --> 51:05.596
Ah! We could use
a new brand of scotch.

51:05.663 --> 51:09.734
This tastes like a poor man's kilt.

51:09.800 --> 51:12.837
- What's for dinner?
- Well, we still have some hot dogs left.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.772
Oh, well,
thank you very much.

51:14.839 --> 51:18.476
- Get dressed. We're going out.
- We are? Where?

51:18.543 --> 51:21.279
Japanese.
I love Japanese.

51:22.947 --> 51:26.016
- I'll make the reservations.
- And Maggie too, huh?

51:26.083 --> 51:28.886
- And the good doctor?
- I don't know. He's still at the hospital.

51:28.953 --> 51:32.323
- He won't be off till 9:00.
- Well, we'll wait for him.

51:32.390 --> 51:34.692
Isn't that nice of me?

51:45.170 --> 51:47.505
Look who's here.

51:47.572 --> 51:49.674
Roxanne.
It's nice to see you.

51:49.740 --> 51:52.310
- Maggie, you know Roxanne.
- Yes. Hello.

51:52.377 --> 51:55.180
- Dr. West, Roxanne.
- No, no, no. Don't get up.

51:55.246 --> 51:57.948
- Um, this is Richard.
- Richard, uh-

51:58.015 --> 52:00.218
- She doesn't know his last name.
- Oh.

52:00.285 --> 52:02.420
Here, take your shoes off,
and come on in and join us.

52:02.487 --> 52:04.522
Waitress, would you, uh,
put some cushions around for us?

52:04.589 --> 52:06.491
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you again.

52:06.557 --> 52:09.294
Abby, come on.
Move up. Pull in your elbows.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.629
Her elbows are like razor blades.

52:11.696 --> 52:13.798
Who would imagine
the States had all this room?

52:13.864 --> 52:16.201
We do, but we're lonely.

52:16.267 --> 52:18.135
I didn't know you were back.
Are you practicing?

52:18.203 --> 52:22.072
- Oh, yes. Trying to play Brahms on a spinet.
- But you have the Steinway.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.409
No, I don't. I need a bulldozer
to get it into the house.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.978
- Well, then use mine.
- Yes, that's a good idea.

52:28.045 --> 52:31.115
Richard, that key I gave you,
give it to Mr. Clarkson.

52:31.182 --> 52:34.219
- It's in your purse.
- Oh, yes, that's right.

52:37.788 --> 52:39.690
You'll have the house all to yourself.

52:39.757 --> 52:42.159
Richard and I are going to Bermuda.

52:42.227 --> 52:44.329
Are we?

52:45.263 --> 52:47.398
I'm glad.
Aren't you?

53:30.908 --> 53:32.843
Western Union.

53:32.910 --> 53:37.415
- Why didn't you call? You could have read it over the phone.
- I know.

53:40.518 --> 53:44.322
- Are you stunned?
- Four hundred dollars? Hardly.

53:44.389 --> 53:46.757
Oh, Myles, I think it's beautiful.

53:46.824 --> 53:48.859
Just for pinning
Duncan Ely down on paper.

53:48.926 --> 53:52.663
Those who can do. Those who can't
write clever little interviews...

53:52.730 --> 53:56.434
about equally divided
between snide and admiring.

53:56.501 --> 53:59.970
Why do you want to be somebody else?

54:00.037 --> 54:03.508
Because I'm nobody the way I was.

54:03.574 --> 54:06.877
That's true.
You've changed.

54:06.944 --> 54:09.347
Oh, it's horribly exciting.

54:10.815 --> 54:14.251
But it's not comfortable
the way it used to be.

54:14.319 --> 54:17.455
Still, in the morning,

54:17.522 --> 54:20.458
I can't bear to have you
pull away from me.

54:25.563 --> 54:27.665
It makes me feel all empty.

54:35.172 --> 54:38.576
Was that you on the piano just now?

54:38.643 --> 54:40.878
Why? Didn't you like it?

54:42.347 --> 54:44.615
I did, but it was frightening.

54:47.652 --> 54:50.355
It was one of Duncan's last tapes.

55:01.265 --> 55:05.302
Myles, why did you say that?
This tape machine is cold.

55:22.019 --> 55:25.523
Oh, well, hello, Roxanne.

55:27.725 --> 55:31.796
Hello, Paula.
Beautiful day.

55:31.862 --> 55:33.798
Hello, Myles.

55:35.766 --> 55:38.436
- What happened to Bermuda?
- Oh, there was some silly hurricane.

55:38.503 --> 55:43.508
So Richard wouldn't fly.
Well, I won't either, not with a coward.

55:43.574 --> 55:47.712
You know, all the interesting men are
either married or not worth the effort.

56:01.992 --> 56:05.530
- No, don't stop. Go on.
- That was you I heard outside, wasn't it?

56:08.032 --> 56:11.702
- It's unbelievable.
- Why? I've been playing 18 hours a day.

56:11.769 --> 56:13.638
Twenty-four.
You practice in your sleep.

56:13.704 --> 56:18.709
But it's not just technique.
It's also faith.

56:18.776 --> 56:22.246
Duncan gave me that faith.
Nobody else.

56:22.312 --> 56:25.716
So if I try to play like him,
that's not surprising, is it?

56:30.287 --> 56:32.523
No.

56:36.961 --> 56:40.397
You're right, and I'm wrong. I think
you should do whatever you want to.

56:41.966 --> 56:45.002
I'm gonna call my friend, Mr. Hurok.

56:45.069 --> 56:48.138
I think Myles can take over
Duncan's concert a week from Friday.

56:48.205 --> 56:50.407
I accept.

58:20.364 --> 58:23.267
Myles, is that you?

58:57.768 --> 59:00.337
I have no choice.

59:00.404 --> 59:02.573
He wants it done right now.

59:08.613 --> 59:11.882
Abby? What do you want with Abby?

59:18.088 --> 59:20.357
Really, I don't want to hurt her.

59:20.424 --> 59:23.560
She's a beautiful little thing.

59:23.628 --> 59:27.765
- But I have to.
- Don't! Please, don't!

59:33.270 --> 59:35.339
Don't!

59:41.578 --> 59:43.681
Sorry. It's part of the bargain.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.655
Mommy.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.227
Mommy.

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:10.835
Mommy. Mommy?

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:15.339
- Mommy?
- What is it?

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:20.244
- Oh, I had the most awful dream.
- Oh, so did I.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.579
It's nothing.

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:26.050
It's not real.
It's not real.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:28.018
It'll go away.

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:35.760
You're warm. Maybe we should take
your temperature, all right?

01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:39.730
Come on. Come on.

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:48.305
Oh, there you go, love.

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:58.415
- Where's that mad animal?
- He's gone.

01:01:58.482 --> 01:01:59.984
He'll be back, unfortunately.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.653
No. No, he went home.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.125
He jumped out.
The window was open.

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:11.996
And you hated him,
so he jumped out and went home.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.232
Roger, what's happening?
I've got to know.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:53.137
We have to identify the bug
before we can kill it.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:57.241
Oh, Paula, she's gonna be all right.
She's strong, like you.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.742
Well?

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:36.580
He doesn't know.
Not yet.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.883
The penicillin didn't do a thing.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:47.557
She's had convulsions,
but they're under control.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.430
They think possibly
it's some kind of spinal-

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.457
Myles?

01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:26.530
Do dreams tell the truth?

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.565
What are you talking about?
What dreams?

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:44.648
How is she?

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.451
I'm afraid she's gone.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:49.619
Oh, my God!

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:54.591
We tried everything.

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:59.663
The truth is we could never...
get a firm diagnosis.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.665
I did.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:09.006
Don't you see?

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:11.608
They put oil on her forehead.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.383
- Paula?
- Paula!

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.351
Paula, stop!

01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:27.992
Paula, don't run away.
Please. Please!

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:30.794
Paula, stop!

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.863
What are you running away for?
That's not gonna help.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:38.568
- Because I'm so scared.
- I know. But I'm here. Don't run away from me.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.609
- Myles, it's come true.
- What? What did?

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:50.080
He said he had to kill her.
Some kind of bargain.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:53.650
- Who?
- Duncan Ely.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:56.686
He said you had these
great hands, like Rachmaninoff.

01:05:56.753 --> 01:06:00.090
And now Duncan's dead.

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:03.160
But you play like him.

01:06:03.227 --> 01:06:05.895
As well as he did.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:10.234
I've heard you.
How did his brain get into your fingers?

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.103
Paula, you've got to
stop talking like this.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:16.240
Oh, he's dead.
I know he's dead.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:21.445
But ever since the night
he died, everything has changed.

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.914
You- You've changed,
even the way you make love.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:28.552
Paula, you're living in a nightmare.
You better wake up.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:33.090
I know! Don't you think I know?
It's hideous!

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:36.360
But suppose it's true.

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:41.831
That book she had- Roxanne.
People who pray to the devil.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:46.703
- Paula.
- Is it possible? Do such things happen?

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:49.639
Those faces in the library.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:55.545
- And my little girl.
- You've gotta calm down.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:58.948
Maybe the doc can give you some
medication, something to help you sleep.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:04.054
Why did he kill her?
Was it really some kind of bargain?

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:07.491
He put the oil right here.
Is that what happened?

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:11.295
- Paula, stop it!
- Oh, Myles, tell me the truth!

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:15.465
Tell me the truth!

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.334
Stop it.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.440
Thank you.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:49.599
Clear footprints
of a giant dog in the snow.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:57.607
The paw marks led straight
to the murdered woman's body,

01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.810
but there were
no marks leading away.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:03.079
The victim's husband...

01:08:03.147 --> 01:08:06.716
was the world renowned pianist,
Duncan Ely.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:13.157
The deceased woman
leaves a married daughter,

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:15.659
Mrs. Roxanne Delancey.

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:21.331
Yes, I was married to
Roxanne... a long time ago.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:25.033
- How is she?
- Beautiful.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.437
I don't like her either.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:29.506
I remember your name now.

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:33.377
You did that article
on Duncan Ely in the Sunday Times.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.779
No, that was my husband.
I just did the typing.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:41.484
Well, uh, Duncan Ely
was a very great man.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:43.687
He was also arrogant,
cruel and annoying.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:47.724
You won't find that
in the article, Mr. Delancey.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:52.162
More important, my husband
forgot to mention... the murder.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:55.198
Was it true?

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:58.033
Was your mother-in-law
murdered by a dog?

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.238
No. No, that's ridiculous.

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:02.805
The Swiss didn't seem to think so.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:06.843
They hung the animal from
the beam of a wooden bridge...

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.246
over a mountain stream.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:14.283
On the curious assumption,
I suppose, that the devil can't swim.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.220
Or don't you believe in the devil?

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:20.490
Those are peasants who still live
in the Middle Ages. We don't.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.795
I have reason to think you're wrong.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:30.700
There are people living today,
like Roxanne, your talented ex-wife.

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:34.103
I don't know how or why,

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:37.407
but I think she was responsible
for the death of my daughter.

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:52.221
Mrs. Daley,
Mrs. Clarkson's ready to leave now.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.358
Would you show her to the elevator?

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:36.760
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:43.867
Bravo!

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:49.873
Bravo! Bravo!

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.948
He's never played
like that before in his life.

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:00.984
He's marvelous.
Marvelous!

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:03.487
And sexy. I mean, don't
you think he's sexy?

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:06.556
- You know him better than I.
- The body's familiar, yes.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:10.960
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:15.465
There's a very handsome man staring
at you, if you feel like a change.

01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:18.402
- Where?
- Over there. One row down.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:23.473
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:46.830
You were sensational.

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:49.232
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.100
Dino.

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:53.970
- You were sensational.
- Thank you very much.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:57.607
Myles, it was just sensational.
I thought it was just beautiful.

01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:14.057
Thank you.
That was very kind of you.

01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:19.829
- Hi, good-looking.
- Oh, nice to see you again.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.466
Uh, Mrs. Clarkson.
The bar is much too crowded.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:25.334
Here, have some of mine, please.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.771
Well, you're a lot more sociable
than you were last time I saw you.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:31.307
- I am also a lot less sober.
- Hmm. Ninety-proof courage?

01:13:31.374 --> 01:13:33.577
Mmm. You're wrong.

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:36.145
I'm not scared of these people.

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:39.182
My ex-wife and her campy crowd.

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:47.657
- Well, I am.
- My, they would be very happy to hear that.

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:50.193
Yes, worship Satan.
Sure.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:53.429
That's just so they can do anything
their little butts desire.

01:13:53.497 --> 01:13:56.199
Oh, hey, listen.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.968
I, uh-

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:02.506
I just wanted to forget
about what happened...

01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:05.274
after Mrs. Ely died
because it was done.

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:07.777
You see?
It was over with.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:13.850
But I began thinking about your child,

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:16.085
and I decided not to be
so goddamn selfish.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:24.227
Hey, my number is on the inside.

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:29.065
Dino.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.975
My, that's a nice perfume
you're wearing. What kind is it?

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:41.044
Shalimar.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:46.282
- Isn't this beautiful? You must be paralyzed with joy.
- As you see.

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:49.252
Myles has been offered the rest of
Duncan's tour. Has he told you?

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:53.356
Chicago, Salt Lake City.
Twenty-four concerts in six weeks.

01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:59.563
Well, Billy boy, how are you, love?

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.197
Since you kicked me out, great.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:07.704
How terribly funny to see you here.
Have you given up your squash?

01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:09.839
He used to play squash
every Friday evening.

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:12.976
No, all I do anymore is make money.
Aren't you sorry?

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:16.345
Oh, I am, darling. I really am.

01:15:16.412 --> 01:15:19.883
Hey, uh, you better keep the whiskey.
You'll need it.

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:22.652
She's gonna tell you
the story of my life.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.857
Ex-husbands are so boring.

01:15:31.494 --> 01:15:33.930
- Have you noticed?
- I like him.

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:38.401
- Don't.
- I think he's rather funny.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.638
He's a dangerous, silly, fraudulent man.

01:15:41.705 --> 01:15:44.774
Maybe that's just
what I've always wanted.

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:54.818
It was very kind of you to come.
I mean it.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.754
I just want you to rest assured
that there's, uh,

01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:01.090
no amatory intention on my part.

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:03.860
Too bad.

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:15.004
Let's start with the facts.
There is no devil.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.906
But there is.

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:20.910
- Where? Introduce me.
- In my nightmares.

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:24.748
Yes, but they're yours.
Well, whatever you dream is yours.

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:27.150
You- You made it up.
Nobody else. Don't you see?

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.854
I know, but they're not like
any dreams I've ever had before.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.690
They're-
They're frightening.

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:36.926
- Because they tell the truth.
- What truth?

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:41.597
My little girl was killed
by these people.

01:16:41.665 --> 01:16:43.667
But why?
Why should they?

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:46.870
Because they bargain with human bodies.

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:20.169
The world's a pretty nice place
to live in, in my opinion.

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:25.709
Why anyone should want to make a religion out
of sickness and hatred, I just don't understand.

01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:33.216
God's not fashionable.
We have to have somebody.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.785
Paula.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:13.089
What- What is so funny?

01:18:13.156 --> 01:18:17.693
I keep thinking you're Myles.
But you're a different shape.

01:18:17.761 --> 01:18:20.363
I know.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:24.801
I sometimes feel the same way
about Roxanne.

01:18:24.868 --> 01:18:29.105
They say the truth is that
once you've had one of them,

01:18:29.172 --> 01:18:31.240
nothing else will quite satisfy you.

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:35.444
- Then you believe?
- I believe that they believe.

01:18:37.613 --> 01:18:40.083
Why did you divorce her?

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:43.419
Because of the child.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:48.324
- You had a child with Roxanne?
- Uh-huh.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:52.962
The same day that, uh,

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:56.465
Mrs. Ely was killed,
Roxanne disappeared.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:02.571
I found her in the snow
halfway up the mountain,

01:19:02.638 --> 01:19:05.141
and she'd had a miscarriage.

01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:11.080
No. No, it was lucky
for all of us it was dead.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:15.284
It was a monster.

01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:29.098
I should have thought a thing like that
would have brought you closer together.

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:32.735
- Yeah, except-
- What?

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:35.504
It wasn't my child.

01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:39.943
Don't you see?

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:43.079
They play at witchcraft because
then they can do anything they like.

01:19:45.915 --> 01:19:49.118
Paula, I've absolutely no proof,

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:51.921
but I'm also absolutely sure...

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:59.062
the man who was
the father of my dead child...

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:03.399
was Duncan Ely.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:17.080
Hey.

01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:25.889
I'll get some more wood.

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:01.857
Bill?

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:05.094
Bill?

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.075
Bill?

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.351
Bill!

01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:50.673
Bill!

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.678
We were not drunk.
We were not taking drugs.

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:31.580
And we were not lovers.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:35.884
What else were you not?
I wasn't with him when he was killed.

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.354
He was out here by himself.

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:41.324
You made a statement.
You said you knew how he died.

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:46.362
Regardless of whether you think we poor
cops will understand or we won't understand,

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:51.100
you're gonna explain to me
exactly what you meant.

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:53.336
I think Bill Delancey
was killed by my husband.

01:22:53.402 --> 01:22:56.805
You said he was out of town.

01:22:56.872 --> 01:23:00.743
That's a pretty good trick, killing a
man all the way from Chicago, Illinois.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:07.083
- He's not really my husband.
- Oh? Why is that?

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.520
Someone's using his body.

01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:19.262
Well, I guess that pretty well
clears this case up, huh?

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:29.832
Darling.

01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:31.260
She knows.

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:35.531
What do I know? That you're not
Myles at all? That you're Duncan Ely?

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.902
And you're in love with her!
You're in love with your own daughter.

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:43.038
I warned her to stay away from Bill,
but she wouldn't.

01:25:43.105 --> 01:25:45.374
You killed Bill.

01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:49.245
You killed Abby.
And now you want to kill me.

01:25:49.312 --> 01:25:52.781
Well, I'm not gonna let you.
Let go of me!

01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:58.120
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Oh, don't touch me!

01:25:58.187 --> 01:26:02.558
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

01:27:52.435 --> 01:27:55.771
That's not his handwriting.
I know it isn't.

01:28:00.343 --> 01:28:03.479
My God!

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:07.883
Oh.

01:32:54.703 --> 01:32:56.805
How are you feeling, Paula?

01:32:56.872 --> 01:32:59.341
Wonderful.
Just wonderful.

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:03.111
Still have that headache?

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:05.113
No.

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.917
But when I move, everything
goes around and around.

01:33:08.984 --> 01:33:11.153
Uh-huh.

01:33:11.219 --> 01:33:14.723
I think you're gonna be just fine.
Better than ever in fact.

01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:19.394
What did you find in my head-
room for rent?

01:33:19.461 --> 01:33:22.631
No. You had a, uh, minor stroke.

01:33:23.899 --> 01:33:27.770
Oh, that's nice.
Who struck me?

01:33:27.836 --> 01:33:32.307
We can't always tell the cause of these
things, particularly in someone your age.

01:33:32.374 --> 01:33:34.509
They happen.
Either you die, or you get better.

01:33:34.576 --> 01:33:39.882
- It wasn't the accident, huh?
- No, no. It was the other way around.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:44.119
What happened inside
your head is what caused the accident.

01:33:47.923 --> 01:33:51.059
- What day is it, Mag?
- It's Tuesday afternoon.

01:33:56.899 --> 01:34:00.402
- Two weeks.
- Three.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:04.372
I've got to get out of here.
There are so many ways to kill a person.

01:34:06.942 --> 01:34:09.544
Sometimes I'm afraid
to drink the water.

01:34:09.611 --> 01:34:12.514
It might be poisoned.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.683
Isn't that silly?

01:34:16.051 --> 01:34:17.986
Paula!

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:23.158
They haven't given up.
I know they haven't.

01:34:25.027 --> 01:34:27.462
They killed Mrs. Ely...

01:34:27.529 --> 01:34:31.299
and Abby and Bill.

01:34:31.366 --> 01:34:33.135
Then they tried to murder me.

01:34:33.201 --> 01:34:35.738
Well, I'm just one grade too tough.

01:34:35.804 --> 01:34:39.775
Paula, if I didn't know you were sane,
I'd think you were a little crazy.

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:44.713
They made a big,
fat bargain with the devil...

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.882
so they could enjoy each other-

01:34:46.949 --> 01:34:50.385
father and daughter.

01:34:50.452 --> 01:34:53.488
Then they realized that
I knew what they were doing.

01:34:53.555 --> 01:34:55.724
- They tried to kill me.
- Paula,

01:34:55.791 --> 01:34:58.260
why don't you just... face the truth?

01:34:58.326 --> 01:35:00.195
What?

01:35:02.264 --> 01:35:06.068
All they are is a thing
on a double bed-

01:35:06.134 --> 01:35:09.304
your Myles and that Roxanne bitch.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:11.406
Listen.

01:35:12.841 --> 01:35:17.345
Abby had some... rare kind of virus.

01:35:17.412 --> 01:35:21.583
And Bill Delancey, he just had
a little too much to drink.

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:25.754
And as far as Mrs. Ely was concerned,
she probably had a very bad heart.

01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:29.758
All I know about is you.
Paula,

01:35:31.493 --> 01:35:33.361
you're sick.

01:35:33.428 --> 01:35:38.934
And you're going to stay sick unless
you make up your mind to just get up and-

01:35:39.001 --> 01:35:41.003
and get a divorce.

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:43.105
No.

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.480
I want Myles.

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:58.253
Whoever he is, I still want him,

01:35:59.554 --> 01:36:01.857
even if it's...

01:36:01.924 --> 01:36:04.492
just once more.

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:21.509
"I shall have no other gods
before me...

01:36:21.576 --> 01:36:24.112
"but thee, O Master.

01:36:24.179 --> 01:36:28.750
"I shall go wherever
thou commandest,

01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:30.819
and shall do thy biddings."

01:39:02.337 --> 01:39:04.272
Master.

01:39:07.209 --> 01:39:09.277
I'm ready to bargain.

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:17.312
- I'm Mrs. Clarkson.
- Good evening.

01:40:17.379 --> 01:40:19.347
- Is Mrs. Delancey in?
- Yes, but she's working-

01:40:19.414 --> 01:40:22.250
Yes, of course she is.
I saw the light in the studio.

01:40:22.317 --> 01:40:24.519
Oh, by the way,
someone smashed one of the headlights.

01:40:24.586 --> 01:40:26.821
You shouldn't leave the Rolls
out there in plain view.

01:40:26.888 --> 01:40:28.956
This neighborhood is full
of rich teenage bastards.

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.759
Yes, yes, thank you.
You're so right.

01:40:50.778 --> 01:40:52.480
Why, Paula, how lovely.

01:40:52.547 --> 01:40:56.351
I was just coming down for a drink.
Would you, uh, care to join me?

01:40:56.418 --> 01:40:59.487
- No, thank you.
- Tea or something?

01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:02.890
I don't have time.

01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:06.094
He's not here.
What do you want?

01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:11.399
I've made a bargain with the master.

01:41:11.466 --> 01:41:14.469
What are you talking about?

01:41:17.339 --> 01:41:19.274
He's on my side now.

01:41:19.341 --> 01:41:22.510
You're insane.
Bennett!

01:42:46.194 --> 01:42:49.897
Oh, Myles, please help me.

01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:03.645
- Paula, answer the phone.
- Mums, sweet peas, daisies.

01:43:03.711 --> 01:43:06.848
- Perfect if she's Virgo. Is she Virgo?
- I kind of doubt it.

01:43:06.914 --> 01:43:10.184
Would you like to enclose a card? We
have beautiful messages already printed.

01:43:10.252 --> 01:43:12.220
- "Best Wishes for a Speedy Recovery"?
- No.

01:43:12.287 --> 01:43:16.658
Listen, uh, I'll deliver those myself.

01:43:16.724 --> 01:43:18.893
Thank you.
Would you just put that on my account?

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.795
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

01:43:38.646 --> 01:43:40.648
Paula?

01:43:46.588 --> 01:43:48.556
Paula?

01:43:53.227 --> 01:43:55.363
Paula?

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.575
Paula?

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:18.920
Paula?

01:45:31.859 --> 01:45:35.196
They made her do it.
They made her kill herself-

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:37.565
that Roxanne bitch and Myles.

01:45:37.632 --> 01:45:40.134
They made her believe all
that nonsense about Satanism.

01:45:40.201 --> 01:45:42.870
Come on, Maggie.
Isn't that a little far-fetched?

01:45:42.937 --> 01:45:44.539
Is it?

01:45:47.475 --> 01:45:53.715
- What on earth is that?
- It was on her face when I found her.

01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:57.752
I don't want people to know
that she believed in that madness.

01:46:25.179 --> 01:46:28.583
Roxanne. Good news.

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:32.687
- She's dead?
- Yes.

01:46:37.258 --> 01:46:42.263
- You sure?
- I was at the Wilcox Avenue Police Station.

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:44.766
They were very sympathetic.

01:46:44.832 --> 01:46:48.269
They broke the news to me- suicide.

01:46:48.335 --> 01:46:50.838
How dreadful.

01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:52.840
Yes, isn't it?

01:47:05.887 --> 01:47:08.422
What did you put on your hands?

01:47:08.490 --> 01:47:10.592
I've changed my perfume.

01:47:11.459 --> 01:47:13.595
It's Shalimar.

01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.632
Do you like it?

01:47:17.699 --> 01:47:20.267
I hate it. It's what our little
housewife used to wear.

01:47:20.334 --> 01:47:22.470
Really?
