00:13.600 --> 00:14.800
Hey there, buddy.

00:15.833 --> 00:19.033
(CHUCKLES) Seems like this is
becoming an annual thing here.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.367
NARRATOR: In Kavik, Sue Aikens
has enlisted the help

00:21.433 --> 00:24.367
of a bush pilot to take her
to a familiar fishing spot.

00:25.533 --> 00:26.967
She's received
a new food supply,

00:27.400 --> 00:29.667
but must continue to stockpile
meat and protein

00:29.733 --> 00:33.167
for her survival through the
dark winter that lies ahead.

00:34.967 --> 00:36.400
SUE: We ready?
We got everything in?

00:36.467 --> 00:37.567
-PILOT: Yep.
-All right.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.067
MAN (ON RADIO):
Kavik six flight two
takes off to the east,

00:42.133 --> 00:43.367
we'll be northbound to Kavik.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.167
SUE: Why would you take
a few hours in an aeroplane
just to go get some fish?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.033
Well, I don't have any food.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.133
All the food went bad
when I had my injury.

00:53.933 --> 00:55.967
It's possible, at that site,
in a couple of hours,

00:56.533 --> 00:58.233
I can get a couple of days'
worth of food.

01:00.033 --> 01:01.500
I'm starting from ground zero,

01:01.567 --> 01:04.000
and when winter hits,
it hits with an iron fist.

01:04.067 --> 01:05.600
And it stays for nine months.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.233
Sue doesn't go down
without a fight.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.700
If I'm gonna starve,
it's gonna be my
own lack of trying.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.500
And that doesn't happen
in my world.

01:18.267 --> 01:20.833
I'm gonna try until
I can't try, 'til I can try.

01:22.467 --> 01:24.800
So I've gotta use
everything in my arsenal

01:24.867 --> 01:26.033
to try and bring
something home.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.033
I'm behind the gun.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.200
I got winter breathing
down my neck.

01:30.267 --> 01:32.367
My time is
tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.333
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:58.000 --> 01:59.833
SUE: My natural alone time,

01:59.900 --> 02:02.000
for nine months,
I have to supply for myself.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.300
It's like having
a biological clock

02:04.367 --> 02:05.800
for a woman
who wants to have a baby.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.433
My biological clock
is saying, "Get food."

02:10.200 --> 02:11.367
Get it now.

02:25.767 --> 02:28.933
I knew I wouldn't have
the big tide current,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.600
but I was hoping
to have a little more water
coming in than this.

02:33.567 --> 02:37.467
So, I don't know if
there's gonna be any
good fishing at all.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.567
The pilot brought me here.
It was a great favour to me.

02:40.633 --> 02:43.833
I've got a fishing pole, and,
uh, I'm gonna give it a whirl.

02:44.133 --> 02:46.000
'Cause even, you know,

02:46.067 --> 02:49.167
one goes in the freezer
and I'm one ahead.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.867
There.

02:56.367 --> 02:59.700
See the lay of the land
and then get down
to getting on some fish.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.467
CHIP: I think my wife,
maybe even a couple
of my daughters,

03:07.533 --> 03:08.833
were born with fish
in their hands.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.033
No silver spoons here.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.800
AGNES: Oh, check
this baby out.
CHIP: Oh, that's fresh.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.133
CHIP: Got meat.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.300
Wow, that's a good one there.

03:27.633 --> 03:28.933
Well, when we're done
with these fish,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.300
I'm gonna have
to go get poles and
some cottonwood,

03:31.367 --> 03:33.800
and we'll be able to set
a smoke onto these guys,
and...

03:33.867 --> 03:36.633
Yep, we definitely need
a smoker going on.

03:36.867 --> 03:40.600
Yeah, me and the girls
could go pick berries,
and we'll take the dog.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.300
Yeah, if you guys
take the dog,
I'll take Qutan.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.967
That way you guys'll have
someone to watch for bears

03:45.033 --> 03:46.733
while you're bent down
looking for berries.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.567
I can see that my wife's
gonna need the rack extended

03:54.633 --> 03:56.567
'cause she's gonna
need to store those fish
once they're dried.

03:56.633 --> 03:58.067
And she's gonna need to
make room for other fish

03:58.133 --> 03:59.267
that she's gonna put on there.

04:00.933 --> 04:02.600
NARRATOR:
Along the Kiwalik River,

04:02.667 --> 04:06.000
the Hailstone family
has spent several days
fishing for salmon,

04:06.067 --> 04:08.900
a key source of protein
in their diet.

04:08.967 --> 04:11.767
Preserving the meat for
the long winter is a priority,

04:11.833 --> 04:14.133
and must be first
processed and dried.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.700
CHIP: We're just gonna
go down the coast here
and get some smoking wood,

04:24.100 --> 04:25.767
what we call cottonwood
around here.

04:27.833 --> 04:30.467
I use it to smoke the fish
and keep the flies off it.

04:31.267 --> 04:34.067
And then I'm gonna build my
wife a cold storage over here.

04:34.133 --> 04:35.867
She calls it a sigloak

04:35.933 --> 04:38.433
and, um, it's gonna be a place
where she can put her berries
and her greens.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.500
You know, we want to not only
go out and get these foods,
but we gotta preserve 'em.

04:43.567 --> 04:46.367
We have to keep 'em and, uh,
get 'em home back to Noorvik,
and freeze 'em.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.233
And then we'll have 'em
all winter to eat.

04:57.133 --> 04:58.333
There you go.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.033
(CHAINSAW BUZZING)

05:05.733 --> 05:07.233
This doesn't cost us much.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.900
It's about two gallons
of fuel round trip.

05:09.033 --> 05:11.467
We're just across
the lagoon five miles

05:11.533 --> 05:13.567
and, uh,
there's a lot of wood here.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.133
This is building material.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.033
If I had to buy from
a store, it'd probably
cost me a lot of money.

05:19.267 --> 05:20.667
Take that back to the boat.

05:28.467 --> 05:29.667
There's four good logs.

05:29.733 --> 05:32.433
It's good for, um, smoking
when you're making fish.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.167
It has a way of just punking
out and smouldering itself.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.833
You don't have to keep
lighting it,

05:36.900 --> 05:39.267
and you don't have to worry
about it just catching
the flame and burning.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.533
It's really good
for, uh, flavour.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.867
And I see some pieces
over here

05:42.933 --> 05:44.533
I'm gonna get for my
sigloak build.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.967
Some longer pieces.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.067
Here, why don't you
give me that?

05:56.133 --> 05:58.233
Got us wood for building
a nice cold storage.

05:58.300 --> 06:02.400

wood for the smoke
on the salmon.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.500
they divide things
between men and women.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.467
And women do certain things
and men do certain things
in ideal situations.

06:12.533 --> 06:15.467
Our ideal situation is that
my wife went off berry-picking
with the girls

06:15.533 --> 06:16.900
and my youngest daughter

06:16.967 --> 06:18.567
didn't want to go
berry-picking,
so she helped me out.

06:18.633 --> 06:21.000
She got to see
where all the wood is
and why I come down here.

06:21.067 --> 06:22.767
She's almost 10,
so spent a little time

06:22.833 --> 06:23.967
together with
the youngest daughter.

out here.

is you're gonna have to
work hard for everything.

I'm always a fan
of the morning time.

a lot of things done.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.933

things you got to do
every morning though

06:55.000 --> 06:57.100
is get woke up
by these damn squirrels.

06:57.267 --> 06:59.467
And they're out there
stealing my dog food.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.200
I see a squirrel right there
eating my dog food.

07:05.133 --> 07:09.267
These guys tear holes into
my $67 bag of dog food.

07:09.333 --> 07:12.500
Every one of those little
pellets that they eat actually
costs a lot of money.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.600
I don't like killing things,
but you know what?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.100
It goes right in the dog pot.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.567
Turn it into dog food.

07:17.867 --> 07:19.767
Just throw it in the cooker
with fish or meat,

07:19.833 --> 07:21.333
whatever I got while
I'm cooking up.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.433
I don't want to let
it go to waste.

out here, you know?

07:25.433 --> 07:26.700

probably laugh at me

07:26.767 --> 07:28.333

for my dogs,

just leave them

These kind of dogs
need a lot of calories,

that I've heard
is a really good
grayling hole,

and find a real honey hole

next week.

you wanted to go to?

10:16.267 --> 10:17.667
How long of a drive is it?

10:17.933 --> 10:20.200
It's not too far.
I think we'll have
some good luck.

10:20.933 --> 10:22.967

out there today

10:25.133 --> 10:26.733

to catch grayling.

gonna get lucky here.

of game fish here in the

we have here is grayling.

a little further than I
usually do with Martha

get into a real honey hole

There are some unknowns
associated with going to
a new spot,

is the risk part is more
about travel with the boat.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.533
The boat is
the bigger obstacle.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.733
You want to make sure
that there are no really
shallow riffles

jacks you up too,

11:24.300 --> 11:27.500

drops and rises,
and drops and rises.

11:34.367 --> 11:35.433

right there.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.267

in these waters before.

who wanted to make it up
to the second set of rapids
and never have,

there's some
boats down there.

is that right there?

Look at that
son of a bitch there.

12:24.233 --> 12:27.233

certain kinds of boats
for certain kinds of rivers.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.700
The flat bottom with the
little jet boat on the back

12:29.767 --> 12:34.000
is meant for running around
small streams with tight turns
and stuff like that.

12:34.067 --> 12:36.300
It's not meant for running
these kinds of white waters.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.867
You need a really big,
heavy boat, with big jets
on the back

12:39.933 --> 12:41.567
to be able to run
these kinds of rivers.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.400
Why don't we land right here,
Erik? This looks safe.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.467
I'm working on it, honey.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.633
Okay.

12:49.700 --> 12:50.700
I'm gonna get up there.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.500
It's usually a good spot
right there to fish,

12:55.567 --> 12:58.067
but it's too high right now
and too rapid,

12:58.133 --> 13:00.567
so we're just gonna play it
safe and fish from shore.

13:01.233 --> 13:04.567
NARRATOR: Erik and Martha,
are surveying the river
for a new grayling hole.

13:06.100 --> 13:10.200
But treacherous rapids
have forced them to test
for a safer fishing spot.

13:12.067 --> 13:14.133
MARTHA: I've lived
in Iliamna my whole life.

13:14.467 --> 13:17.533
I've witnessed some
people doing some
crazy stuff in boats.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.900
There have been some people
who have tried to run these
rapids and had bad luck,

13:20.967 --> 13:24.300
so, you know better
than to play on 'em.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.500
Today our objective
is the smaller prey.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.100
The Arctic grayling.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.933
These rapids right here
are very beautiful.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.367
They're a great place to fish.

13:41.433 --> 13:43.333
But they will kill your ass.
(LAUGHING)

13:44.567 --> 13:46.867
You gotta be really careful
around this type of water,

13:46.933 --> 13:49.600
show the river a lot of
respect and pay attention

13:49.667 --> 13:52.267
and make sure you're
within your abilities
and your limits

13:52.333 --> 13:53.600
before you do anything.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.867
Well, what do
you think, honey?

14:01.933 --> 14:03.800
Should we keep on keeping on?

14:03.867 --> 14:05.633
Yeah, there's not
very many fish here.

14:06.867 --> 14:11.333
Let's go back to the boat and
we can find another channel
and keep on going.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.433
Okay.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.033
ERIK: We're gonna head
back to the boat
and drift out of here

14:20.100 --> 14:22.733
and head up another channel
that doesn't have so many
rapids,

14:22.800 --> 14:25.500
and keep on keeping on
looking for that
honey hole of grayling.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.533
We're nowhere near the spot
I had in mind yet,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.733
and, like usual, Martha and I
got distracted fishing.

14:36.867 --> 14:38.167
CHIP: So we're always
you know, thinking ahead,

14:38.233 --> 14:40.267
living for the day,
but working for tomorrow.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.667
AGNES: We're definitely gonna
be spending our evenings
picking salmon berries,

14:54.733 --> 14:58.300
which is when the salmon
are here after July.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.000
Then the salmon berries
should be ripe.

15:02.700 --> 15:07.000
NARRATOR: While Chip
collects building supplies for
their fish rack and sigloak,

15:07.067 --> 15:09.200
Agnes and the girls
must gather and stockpile

15:09.267 --> 15:11.267
a vital food source
for the coming winter.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.833
It takes a group effort to
get through these willows

15:15.900 --> 15:17.333
'cause you never know
what's in the willows.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.867
There could be, um,
bears, wolves, muskox.

15:23.933 --> 15:25.433
That's why we have
the puppy dog here,

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
so it can just scare
off anything.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.833
Look at the size
of these berries.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.300
And they're ripe.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.700
I usually just try to keep
picking all the ones
that are orange.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.533
You can tell how good
and nice they are.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.200
And I just try
to leave the ones

15:42.267 --> 15:45.433
that are already sunburnt
and stuff, and not ripe.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.700
When we have our
long, cold winter,

15:51.767 --> 15:53.433
it's nice to have
something sweet

15:53.500 --> 15:56.067
besides all the meats
and fish we have.

15:56.133 --> 15:58.700
So we balance it out with
the berries and the greens,

15:58.767 --> 16:00.733
not missing anything
from our diet.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.500
It's hard work.

16:03.567 --> 16:06.367
It's backbreaking, but, um,
in the end it pays off.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.933
Phew, that looks like
that's enough for today.

16:10.033 --> 16:12.000
We could just pack up
and start heading back.

16:18.967 --> 16:21.467
These short pieces right here
are cottonwoods.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.267
Those are gonna be
for smoking salmon.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.233
Then I got these
pine ones over here

16:25.300 --> 16:27.100
and we're gonna be using
those for making the sigloak.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.733
Stick your guys' berries in.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.700
So all the berries you got
don't have to be eaten
right away.

16:30.767 --> 16:31.767
We can save 'em for winter.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.000
-Sound like a good deal?
-AGNES: Sounds like
a real good deal.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.500
CHIP: Yep, it all worked out
good though.

16:36.567 --> 16:38.567
AGNES: Yep, we all work out
real good together.

16:38.633 --> 16:40.133
CHIP: Let's munch.
AGNES: Let's go home and eat.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.400

come on, come on.

JESSIE: You're pretty small
when you're out in the
wilderness out here.

16:47.633 --> 16:48.900
There's other predators,
you know,

16:48.967 --> 16:50.533
that are gonna come in
and try to take your food.

16:57.967 --> 17:01.100
I never grew up, like,
out shooting or hunting
in the woods, you know?

17:01.167 --> 17:03.500
It's just kind of,
a desire that
came to me,

17:03.567 --> 17:05.033
something I wanted to do.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.867
And I somewhat feel cheated
sometimes, to not grow up,

17:06.933 --> 17:09.167
you know,
doing things like this.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.367
You know, for me, like,
guns are really important
where I live.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.100
There's a lot
of wilderness around.

17:16.233 --> 17:19.633
There's a lot of predators.
Wolves, bears, coyotes.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.167
I have a lot of stuff to
protect, you know?

17:21.233 --> 17:23.433
My fish and my dogs
and my own life.

17:24.133 --> 17:26.133
You know, a bear
can come into your camp,

17:26.200 --> 17:27.333
and that could be
all she wrote.

(GUN FIRES)

17:36.067 --> 17:37.267
(GUN FIRES)

17:38.933 --> 17:41.033
I can see that this is
shooting low and to the right.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.533
I'm gonna need
to adjust the sights
for a little more height

17:43.600 --> 17:45.467
and, uh, tweak this over
to the left a little bit.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.600
Okay, I'm gonna
try again here.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.833
(GUN FIRING)

18:05.667 --> 18:07.033
Looking pretty good.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.967
Adjusted these sights
here a little bit

18:09.033 --> 18:10.767
and I'm liking
what I'm seeing.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.167
I'm ready to go kill
some squirrels.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.700
Twenty-two's
the meat gun up here.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.567
You know, you can't always
kill big game, you know?

18:18.633 --> 18:20.500
So you can
survive off of ducks,

18:20.567 --> 18:23.367
geese, beaver,
porcupine, rabbits.

18:24.133 --> 18:26.300
Once, I, uh, got to 17,
I was on the road,

18:26.367 --> 18:27.867
I started learning
how to shoot guns.

18:27.933 --> 18:29.700
Got on with a guy
who was an old Vietnam vet,

18:29.767 --> 18:31.600
he kind of taught me
the ropes of shooting.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.333
And then once I got up here,

18:33.400 --> 18:35.367
I just kind of learned
from hunting and being
out in the woods.

18:40.733 --> 18:41.733
(SQUEAKS)

18:42.067 --> 18:44.400
I hear a squirrel back here.
I see him too.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.133
So this goes back to the dogs,
and goes in the pot.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.567
At least it doesn't
go to waste.

19:18.633 --> 19:20.300
I'm very against
wasting things.

19:20.433 --> 19:22.500
I would never shoot something,
and kill something,

19:22.567 --> 19:24.000
if it couldn't be used
somehow.

19:24.933 --> 19:26.900

around here,

as is getting firewood.

These are jobs that
just have to be done,

these are leftover from

20:36.333 --> 20:38.567
and it goes right back
into the woodstove.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.867
You don't just use wood in
the winter around here,
you use it all year round.

20:42.933 --> 20:44.100
You never can have
enough wood,

20:44.167 --> 20:46.067
you always got to
think ahead on wood.

20:46.133 --> 20:49.267
It's one of the most important
things of living in Alaska.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.700
All right, well I got myself
a little bit of wood here.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.000
This ain't gonna
last me too long,
but it's a good start.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.700
I'm gonna take over some wood
to my dog food cooker

21:00.767 --> 21:02.400
'cause that's where I use
the most wood at,

21:02.467 --> 21:04.800
and, you know,
having all these dogs

21:04.867 --> 21:06.367
makes my wood consumption

21:06.567 --> 21:10.100
at least a third
more to double.

21:10.467 --> 21:13.533
Life would be a lot more
simple if I didn't have dogs,
I'll tell you that.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.100
That isn't what
I'm looking for.

21:15.167 --> 21:18.300
I love living with dogs,
they're my best friends,

had to be made bigger.

21:46.833 --> 21:48.267
There's no way this thing's
gonna accommodate

21:48.333 --> 21:50.333
all of her fish by the time
we get the fish going.

21:51.267 --> 21:54.600
NARRATOR:
Extending their fish rack will
allow the Hailstones to dry,

21:54.700 --> 21:57.133
smoke, and preserve
large quantities of fish.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.767
This will help them with the
supply of protein they'll need
to survive the winter ahead.

22:02.833 --> 22:06.933

it by adding three rows
to what's already up there.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.600

'cause I don't want animals

22:08.667 --> 22:10.733
coming along from the bottom
and getting hanging salmon.

22:15.900 --> 22:19.133
What I gotta do next now that
I have a smooth pole on top
is put another layer of tarps.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.867
And then I'm gonna
put an end over here

22:20.933 --> 22:23.100
that can be used as a doorway
and yet be closed up,

22:23.167 --> 22:26.000
and I'll have a smoking stove
off to one side.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.033
These are to hold the tarp out
and away from the meats.

22:33.100 --> 22:36.867
So that if there's a wind,
that the tarp here doesn't
beat against the meat.

22:39.033 --> 22:41.000
Definitely one advantage
we have here in the Arctic

22:41.067 --> 22:43.133
is that these longer days
in the summertime

When the current's
against them,

they're just invigorated

no way, but, you know,
my time is short,

25:32.333 --> 25:34.433
so I've gotta make
some decisions soon.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.000
Come on, bite on it.

25:41.967 --> 25:43.733
Don't you dare spit it out.

25:44.933 --> 25:46.100
Ah, nice!

25:48.300 --> 25:49.400
Got him!

25:49.967 --> 25:52.833
Whoa!
I don't even know how to get
you out of here, little dude.

25:54.567 --> 25:55.867
That's fucking amazing!

25:56.500 --> 25:58.033
I got a twofer.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.067
I get my old lure
that I just lost

26:00.133 --> 26:01.833
and the new one
that he just ate.

26:03.367 --> 26:04.767
Okay, come meet your cousin.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.833
All righty.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.667
I think one more cast
from here,

26:14.733 --> 26:16.100
and then I've gotta call it.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.033
The pilot's needing
to get his work done.

26:18.367 --> 26:19.800
Kavik doesn't run itself.

26:21.033 --> 26:22.933
It's been a good couple
of hours.

26:23.533 --> 26:26.433
Got a couple of just glory,
prize-winning char.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.833
Those are beauties.

26:28.467 --> 26:30.000
Learning a little
somethin'-somethin'.

26:30.067 --> 26:32.900
I can catch fish out here
even when there's no tide.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.100
Just not many.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.667
And logic says
that there's a lot
more fish in here,

26:39.733 --> 26:42.067
but again,
char is a fighting fish.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.100
When you have a good current,

26:45.167 --> 26:48.100
you'll have a good time
catching char.

26:53.233 --> 26:54.833
It might be hard
for people to grasp,

26:54.900 --> 26:59.000
but I choose to live so remote
from the rest of society

27:00.367 --> 27:02.733
not because
I don't like people.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.933
It's just where
I shine the best.

27:07.867 --> 27:09.200
Okay, little buddy.

27:09.867 --> 27:10.967
All righty, then.

27:11.033 --> 27:13.133
Well, time to wrap up
this little chapter.

27:20.733 --> 27:22.933
JESSIE:
I didn't come up to Alaska
to live some complex life,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.400
I came up here to live simply.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.900
Hey, I got myself
some wood up, you know.

27:36.967 --> 27:38.733
I got some squirrels
knocked down

27:38.800 --> 27:40.700
and, you know,
spent a lot of time
here around my dogs,

27:40.767 --> 27:43.133
and that's a good day
in my mind.

27:44.467 --> 27:46.000
That's one of the reasons
you do live out here,

27:46.067 --> 27:47.967
you gotta work hard,
but it's a hell of a lot more

27:48.033 --> 27:49.833
slow-paced
than a 9:00 to 5:00 job.

27:53.833 --> 27:55.133
You know what time it is, huh?

27:55.867 --> 27:58.200
Favourite time, when I cook
you up some stew.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.500
Pretty proud of this cooker.

28:11.567 --> 28:14.233
This, uh, seals it tight.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.767
Keeps the fire going.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.067
This thing cooks pretty quick.

28:18.267 --> 28:19.433
I got my squirrels.

28:19.933 --> 28:22.000
And then I put 10 gallons
of water in here

28:22.067 --> 28:24.133
for the amount of food
I'm gonna have to cook
for these dogs.

28:25.567 --> 28:27.167
Now it's time
to add some fish.

28:27.433 --> 28:28.800
Big ol' chum salmon, there.

28:32.033 --> 28:33.233
They get kind of excited

28:33.300 --> 28:34.967
when I'm foolin' around
with the cooker.

28:35.033 --> 28:36.167
They know what that means.

28:36.233 --> 28:37.967
They know I'm cookin' 'em up
the good stuff.

28:41.233 --> 28:44.067
This is gonna be
the biggest sustenance
added to this meal,

28:44.133 --> 28:47.167
and this is, uh, real high
quality human-grade chicken.

28:48.667 --> 28:50.633
You ain't gonna feed
these dogs off of squirrels,

28:50.700 --> 28:52.100
that's for sure.

28:52.167 --> 28:54.067
But, you know, the reason
I cook these squirrels

28:54.133 --> 28:55.833
is just to not see 'em
go to waste.

28:57.533 --> 29:00.833
Grab one more bucket of meat
and this sucker'll be cookin'.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.467
All right, now this fish
and this meat and this fat,

29:05.533 --> 29:07.200
this is what really
substains my dogs.

29:09.267 --> 29:11.533
These dogs are meant
to like, travel,

29:11.600 --> 29:12.967
and they have great endurance,

29:13.033 --> 29:14.600
and great endurance
relies on fat.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.167
That's where their energy
comes from.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.000
And protein is what repairs
their muscles from, like,

29:20.067 --> 29:21.600
the extreme training,
you know,

29:21.667 --> 29:23.033
and builds back new muscle.

29:23.967 --> 29:25.500
Put some squirrel in there.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.567
This is a major resource
to me.

29:27.633 --> 29:28.700
Without this resource,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.800
I can't continue to have
as many dogs as I have.

29:34.067 --> 29:35.267
It's time to feed the dogs!

29:37.733 --> 29:38.967
Dogs don't just need food,

29:39.033 --> 29:40.833
they need tons of love
and attention.

29:40.900 --> 29:42.600
They need a good,
solid pack leader.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.400
Everything I do is for
my dogs, and like,

29:46.467 --> 29:47.733
they come before me, you know,

29:47.800 --> 29:48.800
and that's the way
it should be

29:48.867 --> 29:50.100
whenever you got a bunch
of animals,

29:50.167 --> 29:52.167
'cause I choose to have
this many dogs, you know.

29:52.233 --> 29:54.233
I choose to be ambitious
and wanna race.

29:56.733 --> 29:58.533
Oh, there's one of
those squirrels, Prince.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.467
Yeah! There you go.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.533
As you can see,
the dogs like it, you know,

30:07.600 --> 30:09.300
it just adds a little
more nutrition

30:09.367 --> 30:10.800
to the diet
and a little variety.

30:12.867 --> 30:15.267
Mostly, it just keeps me
from wasting resource.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.767
When you live out here
and stuff's sparse,

30:16.833 --> 30:18.700
you just try to use
everything you got.

30:18.767 --> 30:20.400
And dog mushin's expensive.

30:21.267 --> 30:24.967
So, to like learn how to
utilise these resources
is extremely important to me.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.267
Dogs are happy, I'm happy.

30:28.567 --> 30:29.633
I feel like a king, you know.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.367
I got everything I need
around here.

30:37.933 --> 30:39.600
CHIP: I have other people
that are counting on me.

30:39.700 --> 30:41.800
And part of counting on me
is me being able to do

30:41.867 --> 30:43.367
the things that they want
and need.

30:56.233 --> 30:57.700
It's nice, soft dirt,
I gotta say.

30:57.767 --> 30:58.800
Lot of sand in it.

30:58.867 --> 31:00.300
Some clay, not much.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.867
Well, the point of having
a fish rack

31:02.933 --> 31:05.567
and the point of having
a nice cold hole

31:05.633 --> 31:07.433
to store things is
to preserve stuff.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.000
If you've got all this food

31:09.067 --> 31:10.433
and you're trying to keep
a surplus,

31:10.500 --> 31:12.267
you have to have
a way of preserving it.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.133
This right now is just about
keeping what we've worked
so hard to get a hold of

31:15.200 --> 31:16.667
in good condition
to get it home,

31:17.933 --> 31:19.600
so we can have it
for the winter.

31:22.833 --> 31:24.267
-Is this gonna be the door?
-Yep.

31:26.433 --> 31:28.033
If you have it just laying
here on the ground

31:28.100 --> 31:30.267
like a hole in the ground,
a bear could just part it.

31:30.367 --> 31:32.167
Weasels can go in it.
Mice will fill it.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.167
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,

31:35.233 --> 31:37.667
it's crucial to build
a cold storage, or sigloak,

31:37.733 --> 31:39.967
to preserve their supply
of berries and greens,

31:40.033 --> 31:41.867
and protect the food
from predators.

31:42.933 --> 31:44.000
CHIP: Old-timers
used to make 'em round.

31:44.067 --> 31:45.067
I make mine square.

31:45.333 --> 31:46.367
It's got a lot more to go.

31:46.433 --> 31:47.600
I'm just getting
the basic frame down.

31:49.833 --> 31:52.300
Ah! How come!

31:54.667 --> 31:57.533
It just smacked my
knuckle really hard.
Pissed me off.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.467
It's not bleeding or anything,
just got thumped.

31:59.533 --> 32:01.633
It's gonna be a little blue
right there.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.233
It just caught my knuckle
up here in front

32:03.300 --> 32:04.767
and gave me a good
little whack.

32:05.100 --> 32:09.433
I guess what I did was
probably take it off the tip
when I pushed the tip,

32:09.500 --> 32:12.933
and I was sideways,
and it just gave it a chance
to roll off the side.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.367
The trick is to make sure
the bar isn't bent.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.833
But it's not.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.800
And a long time ago,
if an Eskimo came
across a chainsaw,

32:20.867 --> 32:22.433
there's no way
he would have rejected it.

32:22.767 --> 32:24.100
Folks up here have
always wanted

32:24.167 --> 32:26.333
to make their lives better
in a really harsh environment,

32:26.400 --> 32:28.100
and you really gotta admit
that they came up with some

32:28.167 --> 32:31.100
very clever ways to
do it socially and to
do it personally.

32:31.433 --> 32:34.467
And these folks up here,
if there's a better way
to do something,

32:34.533 --> 32:37.133
they have always
incorporated it into their
way of doing things.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.333
And we have a door!

32:43.833 --> 32:44.933
Is it done yet?

32:45.067 --> 32:46.133
It's almost there.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.533
I got the basic frame up.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.600
The idea of making it,
building it,

32:49.667 --> 32:55.067
is to keep all the foods fresh
and keep all the mice away,

32:55.133 --> 32:56.367
so they don't go bad.

32:57.967 --> 32:59.367
CHIP: It's part of living
like we do, Bun.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.300
So we don't have to depend
on anybody but ourselves.

33:03.667 --> 33:05.000
There ain't much
for jobs up here,

33:05.067 --> 33:06.467
so you gotta make
your own work.

33:07.667 --> 33:09.067
Qutan there's our
youngest daughter,

33:09.133 --> 33:11.367
and it's always been a pure
joy just to teach the kids.

33:11.433 --> 33:13.433
We consider this to be part
of their education.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.867
They have to have
local knowledge
of the local materials

33:16.933 --> 33:18.533
and the local foods,
when to be there,

33:18.600 --> 33:20.433
what to do with 'em,
and how to store 'em.

33:20.667 --> 33:23.267
We cut down these willows
quite a while back,

33:23.333 --> 33:24.967
and they're useful
for lots of things.

33:25.033 --> 33:27.367
I just need the willows right
now to hold down the grasses

33:27.433 --> 33:29.167
that we've stacked against it
for an insulative layer.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.033
I'm done.

33:37.633 --> 33:39.367
Just flip it all the way up
and back,

33:39.433 --> 33:40.833
so it doesn't fall on
your head.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.133
-Not bad, huh?
-Can I go in?

33:43.200 --> 33:44.733
Yeah, you can get in.
You can play.
You can do whatever.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.267
So I'm pretty happy
with what's going on.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.667
We'll have a place to store
berries and greens

33:48.767 --> 33:50.967
and use like a refrigerator
and have no mice.

33:51.033 --> 33:52.567
We'll have a place over here
to dry foods up.

33:53.967 --> 33:56.100
I know it's kind of
small and narrow,
but that's the whole idea.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.533
If we made it really big,
it would be hard to keep it
cool and chilled.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.833
It's big to me.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.233
Well, it's big to you
'cause you's a little lady.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.433
It's just part of
preservation.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.733
You don't wanna
work really hard

34:04.800 --> 34:06.867
not to be able to, uh,
use what you've got.

34:09.867 --> 34:10.967
SUE: The worlds are colliding,

34:11.033 --> 34:12.300
and they're formin'
a good circle.

34:20.867 --> 34:22.033
Touchdown!

34:22.233 --> 34:23.767
Awesome fishing trip!

34:23.833 --> 34:24.833
Yay!

34:25.000 --> 34:26.133
But, here, thank you, Jake.

34:26.267 --> 34:27.400
You're sure welcome.

34:27.467 --> 34:29.233
-I sure, I appreciate it.
-Absolutely.

34:37.267 --> 34:39.600
Wanna get the sand off,
clean 'em up.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.467
Make a nice, smooth,
clean cut.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.433
And just get the guts
out of 'em.

34:46.367 --> 34:49.900
Um, getting this fish
is super important to me.

34:51.900 --> 34:56.967
So, you know, anything
that's gonna help me
be successful

34:57.033 --> 35:01.033
in obtaining my food stores
is a good thing.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.300
I want as much of the meat.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.067
Gonna lop off his tail
down here.

35:08.700 --> 35:09.900
I'm a single person.

35:11.267 --> 35:13.633
That's a nice-size
little fishy steak.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.000
Look at that.

35:15.067 --> 35:18.533
This is actually a trout,
related to a trout,

35:18.600 --> 35:20.067
but it's got pink meat
like a salmon.

35:24.233 --> 35:26.900
You know, I had about 500
pounds of food that went bad.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.567
And that's of all varieties.

35:30.067 --> 35:33.500
You know, it may not
seem like a lot, but it is.

35:33.567 --> 35:36.067
Looking at it,
"Oh, it's only two fish."

35:36.167 --> 35:38.267
Well, it's not just two fish.

35:38.567 --> 35:41.233
This is the same
as going and getting,

35:41.300 --> 35:45.033
down south,
maybe a week's supply
of protein for somebody.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.733
And I did it in
a couple of hours.

35:48.700 --> 35:51.733
This is a grand total
of six meals.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.500
Every day I wake up
and my brain just says,

35:55.567 --> 35:57.900
"What the heck
can I learn today?"

35:57.967 --> 35:59.600
I learnt that I could put
six meals up,

35:59.667 --> 36:00.933
visit with a friend,

36:01.967 --> 36:03.467
learn about my fishing hole.

36:05.667 --> 36:06.833
What a great day.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.000
All righty.
Now to add to my little pile.

36:16.033 --> 36:17.167
Boom.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.767
Adding a little sushi
to the winter food.

36:23.267 --> 36:25.233
ERIK: I couldn't be luckier.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.733
I wake up every day and my
wife and I are self-employed,
and we do our own thing,

36:27.800 --> 36:29.967
and we just have a good time
running Talarik Creek Lodge.

36:37.033 --> 36:39.167
Just reading the water,
it looks really good right
in here.

36:40.967 --> 36:43.233
NARRATOR:
Violent river rapids have
forced Erik and Martha

36:43.300 --> 36:45.933
to change course
in their search for
a new grayling hole.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.433
Finding its location
is critical

36:48.500 --> 36:51.267
for their subsistence
and incoming clients.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.067
Let's drift down from here.

36:54.433 --> 36:57.567
The grayling fishery
here in Alaska,
as a whole, is strong.

36:57.633 --> 37:01.167
It's a native fish. They're
found in almost all fresh
waters here in Alaska,

37:01.233 --> 37:04.433
and they're just
a really vibrant,
hard-fighting, sport fish.

37:04.733 --> 37:06.400
Both to catch
and eat for supper.

37:10.233 --> 37:12.900
So we're just up here
exploring a new
fishing ground,

37:12.967 --> 37:14.567
few days in between
fishing clients,

37:14.633 --> 37:17.633
and I've learned it makes
it a lot more fun and exciting

37:17.700 --> 37:20.033
to fish different
waters every day.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.933
We always like to experiment,
get out there,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.500
and check out
some new fisheries.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.333
Today's just a fun day
for Martha and I to go out
and do a little fishin',

37:27.400 --> 37:29.667
but at the same time,
we're scouting out a new area.

37:31.167 --> 37:36.000
Martha, despite being the
sweetest nice girl ever,
is extremely competitive.

37:36.067 --> 37:37.167
And she loves to fish.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.567
All right,
I'll tell you what, Martha?

37:41.633 --> 37:44.400
Whoever catches
the biggest fish doesn't
have to clean 'em.

37:44.467 --> 37:45.533
MARTHA: Sounds good.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.733
ERIK: Are you gonna
catch the biggest?
MARTHA: I'm gonna try.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.800
Oh, but I thought you were
super fisher woman,

37:50.867 --> 37:52.700
down from Alaska Peninsula,
Iliamna.

37:52.767 --> 37:53.933
Always catch the biggest fish.

37:54.133 --> 37:56.367
This is what I did as a child,
I'd come out on the...

37:57.767 --> 37:59.533
Oh, yeah! (LAUGHS)

37:59.600 --> 38:01.200
-I got a fish.
-You got one?

38:03.767 --> 38:05.800
Nice-sized grayling. Look it!

38:07.200 --> 38:08.700
Okay, so you got the first.

38:08.767 --> 38:10.067
Bam! I got one too.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.167
Yours looks small.

38:14.233 --> 38:15.933
ERIK: Mine doesn't
look small to me.

38:17.667 --> 38:19.233
Let's have this one for dinner
with the other one.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.167
Aw, shoot.
I think Martha's is bigger.

38:26.233 --> 38:27.733
You wanna measure fish?

38:31.800 --> 38:33.167
ERIK: Oh, holy moly!

38:33.233 --> 38:35.367
Looks like you're
cleanin' fish.
Look at this beast.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.567
You clean the fish,
I cook the fish.

38:38.633 --> 38:39.933
That's the way that it goes.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.633
ERIK: This is a really
beautiful Arctic grayling
here.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.033
They call it the sailfish
of the north.

38:44.100 --> 38:46.233
It has this really neat sail
on the top.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.433
Just protect his gills
and hold his body there,

38:48.500 --> 38:49.967
and this is a pretty nice one.

38:50.033 --> 38:51.700
We're gonna go ahead
and release this one,

38:51.767 --> 38:54.767
give him a kiss and
hopefully this fish will still
be here next week

38:54.833 --> 38:56.100
for a client of mine to catch.

38:58.533 --> 39:01.300
We're gonna go ahead and
call this a successful trip,

39:01.367 --> 39:03.133
and we know where to bring our
clients in the future.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.200
And right now, we're gonna go
and find some dry firewood

39:05.267 --> 39:07.933
and make a little campfire
and eat some grayling supper.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.433
Super easy to make a shore
lunch or dinner on the river.

39:14.500 --> 39:18.667
All you need is a bunch
of dry wood, a pan,

39:18.733 --> 39:20.333
little bit of butter,
and fish.

39:21.333 --> 39:25.867
The bark of the birch tree
is the best fire-starter
that exists in nature.

39:26.133 --> 39:28.367
So I don't know what
kind of wood we're gonna
round up here,

39:28.433 --> 39:30.200
but whatever it is,
we get it going

39:30.267 --> 39:32.200
with some of this birch bark
as an accelerant.

39:33.633 --> 39:35.100
-Look at that.
-Nice.

39:36.633 --> 39:38.167
That's probably
good enough for now.

39:38.233 --> 39:40.300
That should make
a good bed of coals.

39:40.367 --> 39:42.667
I'm gonna clean those fish
since you're the big winner.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.467
Nice white meat fish.

39:47.533 --> 39:50.133
Mix it up with some onions
that Martha has along ready
to go,

39:50.200 --> 39:51.700
and it's gonna make
for a delicious meal.

39:54.800 --> 39:55.833
MARTHA: It's a good spot.

39:56.233 --> 39:58.600
Definitely gonna bring clients
next week up there,

39:58.667 --> 40:01.000
-make a day of it.
They'll love it.
-Oh, yeah.

40:03.433 --> 40:05.267
Aw, that was good.

40:05.333 --> 40:07.400
MARTHA: So today Erik and I
went out to have a fun day
out on the river,

40:07.467 --> 40:10.533
and also look for a good
spot for our clients
to fish grayling.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.833
We managed to find a really
great grayling hole.

40:13.067 --> 40:14.367
We caught us a bunch
of grayling.

40:14.433 --> 40:16.167
Now we're nice and full,
so we're gonna head home.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.267
It was a beautiful day out
on the river.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.700
Just another great day
in Iliamna.

40:25.167 --> 40:27.067
CHIP: Food is the centre
of a lot of things we do.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.567
Food is the reason
why we hunt,

40:28.633 --> 40:30.667
it's the reason why we gather,
it's the reason why we fish.

40:42.733 --> 40:44.200
AGNES: Oh, awesome.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.233
So how do you work this?

40:46.300 --> 40:47.833
CHIP: It's, uh,
just a board for a lock.

40:49.167 --> 40:51.533
Just pull it out, unlock it.

40:52.067 --> 40:54.233
Look, it flips all the way up
so you don't hurt yourself.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.100
-It'll fold all the way back.
-(LAUGHS) Cool.

40:56.267 --> 40:57.933
If you wanna
get down in there,

40:58.000 --> 40:59.800
we can hand you all these
buckets and you guys
can stack 'em proper.

40:59.867 --> 41:02.733
And that'll be good for your
seal oil in the spring,
and the eggs.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.567
It'll be good for birds
to keep 'em cool,

41:04.633 --> 41:06.600
it'll be good for greens
and for berries.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.533
Chip and Qutan was real busy
around camp.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.700
They made us a sigloak,
which is a cold storage.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.433
That turned out pretty good.
I'm real happy for that.

41:16.500 --> 41:20.133
Now he won't have to
worry about my berries
and greens going sour.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.100
CHIP: Should we have
these bellies for dinner?

41:26.167 --> 41:28.367
-All the ones up
to here are salt.
-CHIP: Okay.

41:28.433 --> 41:30.100
All right, then I'm gonna put
these all in the same rack.

41:30.333 --> 41:32.067
-That would be perfect.
-Yes, it would.

41:36.633 --> 41:38.200
AGNES: Nice, yeah?
CHIP: Yeah, ain't it?

41:38.467 --> 41:40.167
-This'll do just fine, huh?
-Yeah.

41:40.233 --> 41:42.067
This will do just fine.

41:42.133 --> 41:43.167
I really like it.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.533
CHIP: I like revitalising
this camp quite a bit.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.800
It's been a lot of fun.

41:52.133 --> 41:54.033
This is our backyard.
This is our home.

41:54.967 --> 41:56.600
It's where we live,
and we know where
the food comes from.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.067
And not only that,
it's the chase
that is involved.

42:00.133 --> 42:01.467
And for my kids, it's culture.

42:01.533 --> 42:03.267
In their background,
they can see the things

42:03.333 --> 42:04.500
that their grandparents
have done.

42:06.867 --> 42:09.200
Maybe materials have changed,
but the food hasn't.

42:11.233 --> 42:12.733
The animals haven't
and the land hasn't.

42:13.433 --> 42:15.367
So I think folks here
are pretty well intact,

42:15.433 --> 42:17.300
and they're pretty well
grounded in what's going on.

42:17.367 --> 42:18.567
And, um, I like that.

42:18.633 --> 42:20.400
I like knowing
where my food's from.

42:23.100 --> 42:26.100
For now, we've got enough
to keep all the meats
stored really well,

42:26.167 --> 42:27.533
and all the greens,
and all the berries.

42:27.900 --> 42:29.633
We'll get 'em to Noorvik,

42:29.700 --> 42:32.433
I think, in better shape than
we have in a couple years.

42:35.167 --> 42:38.400
It's very important,
when we're trying to live
the subsistence lifestyle,

42:38.467 --> 42:41.500
because not only we're out
here to get the food
and preserve it,

42:41.567 --> 42:44.633
we also want to store it
and make sure
it's stored properly,

42:44.833 --> 42:46.967
so when we bring it back home
and eat it this winter,

42:47.033 --> 42:48.367
it'll still taste as good.

42:49.433 --> 42:51.333
If you go through all this
tremendous effort

42:51.400 --> 42:54.133
to get all this equipment,
to do all this work,
and you get all this food,

42:54.200 --> 42:56.767
if you don't take care of it
and preserve it,
there's no point to it.

42:58.900 --> 43:01.067
So it's just a continuation
of what it is we're about.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.400
So we'll let these smoke and
we'll let the berries chill

43:05.133 --> 43:06.733
and we'll go eat
our dinner, huh?
Call it a night.

43:08.033 --> 43:09.867
Pretty happy with the way
that all ended up.

43:09.933 --> 43:11.333
My wife's pretty happy, too.

43:11.700 --> 43:12.967
AGNES: A good day.
CHIP: Oh, what a good day.
