WEBVTT

00:06.381 --> 00:09.718
[exhales] Holy shit, man.
I'm gonna have to reinforce this loft.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.387
At one point, it felt like we were
doing it on a rope bridge.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.304
[chuckles]

00:13.388 --> 00:16.433
Speaking of which... Wanna do it
on a rope bridge sometime?

00:17.475 --> 00:20.770
I did that on vacation once.
Doesn't move as much as you'd think.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.441
Plus, Donald Duck was yellin' at us
from down below the whole time.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.151
[chuckles]

00:26.234 --> 00:28.778
Speaking of people being mad at you
for having sex,

00:28.862 --> 00:31.823
where does old, uh, prison Nick
think you're at right now?

00:32.407 --> 00:34.492
Don't worry. I left him a note. I said,

00:34.576 --> 00:36.494
"If you need me,
I'll be having sex with Rooster."

00:36.578 --> 00:38.163
-Mmm.
-[knocking at door]

00:38.246 --> 00:39.914
-Shit.
-Who is that?

00:40.498 --> 00:42.208
Wait. Did you really leave him that note?

00:42.292 --> 00:43.376
-No, I didn't.
-Get in there!

00:44.669 --> 00:49.132
Hey, fellas, that's some good, uh,
ninja practice with them nunchucks.

00:49.632 --> 00:52.802
I think it's time we, uh,
move on to the throwing stars, all right?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.095
I'll be right there.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.390
Okay. [sighs]

00:58.933 --> 01:01.519
Did all the ninjas
ride here together in Mary's car?

01:02.812 --> 01:04.314
[Rooster] Jeez, Colt. What you doing here?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.816
-Hey Colt. You didn't see me.
-Oh, yeah?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.402
What's it worth to you?

01:09.486 --> 01:11.321
What are your balls worth to you?

01:12.572 --> 01:17.494
Hey, Rooster, since we're here alone,
I've got some good news. [sighs]

01:17.577 --> 01:19.329
Neumann's Hill's dropping the charges.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.288
Oh.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.750
And Abby and I... are having a baby girl.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.461
-Oh, my God, that's great!
-Whoa!

01:26.544 --> 01:28.338
Damn, man, first Bennett girl.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.132
I cannot wait for her to bring home
the next Colt Bennett

01:31.216 --> 01:32.759
to meet the original Colt Bennett.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.261
I wouldn't even let her anywhere near
that handsome son of a bitch.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.179
[Mary chuckles]

01:37.055 --> 01:40.642
Man, having a baby
is the most amazing thing in the world.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.519
Then you bring them home
from the hospital.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.939
They slowly drain your hopes and dreams.
Eventually, you drop out of college

01:46.022 --> 01:48.983
and end up hooking up with
a midget lumberjack in his mom's cabin.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.735
[laughs]

01:52.112 --> 01:53.863
What, you talking about me?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.031
[Mary chuckles]

01:55.115 --> 01:57.659
-Congrats. I'm happy for you.
-Thank you.

01:57.742 --> 02:00.120
-See you later.
-All right. See you later, girl.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.747
-[door closes]
-[Rooster exhales]

02:02.831 --> 02:04.749
What is going on with you two?

02:04.833 --> 02:06.417
I thought she was back
with her ex-husband.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.169
Yeah, man, so did I.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.879
I'm guess I'm gonna have to get

02:09.963 --> 02:12.715
a surgeon general's warning
on my underwears.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.677
"Warning: Contents may be addictive."

02:16.261 --> 02:19.889
"Side effects may include itching,
vomiting and severe regret."

02:19.973 --> 02:21.224
[Rooster chuckles]

02:22.058 --> 02:24.727
-Crazy, dude, you're having a girl.
-Yup.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.480
I assume you're gonna name her
after the mom? Colt Jr.?

02:28.731 --> 02:30.775
Am I the baby's mom
or are you the baby's dad?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.443
You gotta pick one joke or the other.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.611
Hmm.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.363
I don't know. I kinda like 'em both.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.159
Hey, if you want, I can give you a hand.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.828
We can turn my old bedroom
into a nursery for the baby.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.998
I'm never gonna save up enough
for that tanning bed, so...

02:46.749 --> 02:48.001
You don't need one of those, man.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.169
You just gotta go to Denny's
when it's not so crowded,

02:50.253 --> 02:52.213
lay underneath them food lamps.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.049
-Get you nice and crispy.
-[chuckles]

02:55.133 --> 02:56.384
Hey, uh... Jesus.

02:56.467 --> 02:59.053
I was thinking, uh... [inhales deeply]

02:59.137 --> 03:02.307
You know, if, uh... you help me out,

03:02.390 --> 03:05.143
we could get that Peterson place rebuilt
before the baby comes.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.269
Oh, yeah, sure.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.313
Long as you don't mind
putting some blisters

03:08.396 --> 03:10.064
on them pretty little baby hands of yours.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.317
Buddy, whatever it takes.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.234
I ain't too worried.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.362
Neutrogena's coming out with a new lotion
for intense healing.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.530
Oh.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.700
Hey, thanks. I appreciate the help.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.035
Of course, dude. You're my brother.

03:22.118 --> 03:25.204
[smacks lips] Besides, me and Abby
are gonna need a place to hook up

03:25.288 --> 03:26.998
when you're watching our baby.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.709
See? How am I supposed to choose?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.756
[theme song playing]

04:37.652 --> 04:40.571
Record this. I wanna see
the look on the old man's face

04:40.655 --> 04:42.073
when he finds out
he's having a granddaughter.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.700
[both chuckle]

04:45.118 --> 04:46.244
[Rooster sighs]

04:46.953 --> 04:49.122
-Hey, there, unborn baby niece.
-[chuckles]

04:49.205 --> 04:52.125
That's your daddy. [chuckles]
What you're about to see is very rare.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.169
Now, it's not a unicorn.
It's not a dragon.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.880
It is your pop-pop about to smile.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.509
Dad, I've got some good news.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.178
Did you steal a generator
from Neumann's Hill?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.973
Stop. Stop recording.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.394
Lisa came by and said you confessed
to stealing one.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.690
I took it.
It saved the ranch from the fire.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.109
What the hell is the matter with you?

05:18.192 --> 05:21.863
I'd rather this place burn to the ground
than steal someone else's equipment.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.825
Now you're not only a fuck-up,
you're a thief, too?

05:25.908 --> 05:30.288
All right, Dad...
Look, I stole the generator, okay?

05:30.371 --> 05:31.205
Christ.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.917
Colt just got caught trying to ditch it.
He knew you'd get pissed if you found out.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.378
So if you're gonna be mad at somebody,
go ahead and be mad at me.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.714
I'll be mad at whoever the fuck I want.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.799
Fine. Then trust your first instinct.
Be mad at Colt.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.303
Look. We know we screwed up.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.056
Okay? But I already apologized to Lisa.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.640
Did you apologize to her

05:49.724 --> 05:53.853
or did you use my relationship with her
to get yourself off the hook?

05:53.936 --> 05:57.440
Dad, she said she understood,
and she's dropping the charges.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.983
I told her not to.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.610
You what?

06:01.319 --> 06:04.155
-Why would you do that?
-Because I believe in right and wrong,

06:04.238 --> 06:07.241
and when you cross that line,
there's a fuckin' price to pay.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.035
[Colt sighs]

06:10.244 --> 06:13.581
[smacks lips]
If Lisa Neumann is okay with it,

06:13.664 --> 06:15.041
-why aren't we--
-[Beau] Stop.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.295
Nothing you can say
is gonna change what you did.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.593
You're both a couple of
fucking embarrassments.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.150
What the hell?

06:51.577 --> 06:52.870
Make coffee.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.337
Make coffee, please.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.882
It's not a robot, Beau.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.510
-What is it?
-It's a Keurig.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.387
Pass.

07:09.470 --> 07:13.057
Ah, come on, Beau.
You should love this thing.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.476
It, uh, makes great coffee,
made in America,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.645
and it's terrible for the environment.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.607
Even the name sounds weird. Keurig?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.359
Mr. Coffee.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.653
Pretty clear what's going on there.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.116
Watch this. It loads like a shotgun.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.411
You open the chamber.

07:33.995 --> 07:34.996
Pop in a shell.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.292
Boom! You just bagged yourself
a medium-sized hazelnut cream.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.962
I'd rather put a real shotgun in my mouth.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.340
I had one of these in my house.
I thought you might enjoy it.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.843
Your coffee pot must be 20 years old.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.386
-Thirty.
-[scoffs]

07:50.470 --> 07:52.680
I bought it with a Reagan tax cut.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.892
And I used it to stay up all night
after he was shot.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.604
I can take it back. No problem.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.606
Reason for return, I'll just check

08:01.689 --> 08:05.318
"No emotional connection
to presidential assassination attempt."

08:06.444 --> 08:07.695
No, that's all right.

08:07.778 --> 08:11.991
If that's the kind of coffee you like,
I can give it a chance.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.910
Thank you.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.038
How'd you sleep?

08:17.622 --> 08:18.581
Pretty well.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.709
I just kept waking up,
thinking I was home. [chuckles]

08:22.502 --> 08:23.503
Yeah.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.214
This must be pretty overwhelming.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.090
Yeah, I think that's why I picked this up.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.426
Hmm. It gives me a sense of normalcy.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.137
Every morning, I'd make a cup, and I'd...

08:33.221 --> 08:35.556
sit and watch the birds on the feeder.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.434
It's funny the things you miss.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.394
The sound of the furnace clicking on

08:40.478 --> 08:42.647
and the feel of the carpet
underneath my feet.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.107
Oh, and my bed. I just love my bed.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.527
No offense,
but your mattress is kinda lumpy.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.028
That's probably the rifles.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.488
[chuckles]

08:51.113 --> 08:52.615
Give it a little time.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.451
Maybe you'll start to feel at home here.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.078
[coffee machine whirring]

08:58.204 --> 08:59.038
Oh, good.

08:59.705 --> 09:04.961
And at the end of that soothing sound,
there's a cup of hazelnut cream.

09:08.798 --> 09:09.882
Morning, boys.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.676
-Hey, Joanne.
-Joanne.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.304
I don't need you two today.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.765
What are you talking about?

09:18.307 --> 09:20.184
Neumann's Hill's dropping off
their cattle this morning.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.477
I got it covered.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.146
[sighs] Dad, we don't wanna be around you

09:24.230 --> 09:26.566
as much as you don't wanna be around us,
all right?

09:26.649 --> 09:27.817
That's why we're family.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.444
But we got a lot of work to do today.

09:30.945 --> 09:34.490
Let me make it more clear. Go away.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.200
[scoffs]

09:37.076 --> 09:40.496
Fuck it. You wanna do all the work? Fine.
Do all the work.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.123
Good luck.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.375
Bye, Joanne.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.673
I assume that's about the generator.
You wanna talk about it?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.133
Nope.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.136
-Beau.
-I don't wanna talk about it.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.390
Okay. Well, good luck
making coffee this morning.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.480
Hey, Colt.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.318
Mind if I steal a moment of your time?

10:11.902 --> 10:12.820
Steal?

10:14.155 --> 10:15.489
Like you did with the generator?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.451
Nothing?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.746
I worked all morning on that.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.833
-You gonna bill me for that?
-Well, not now.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.588
[grunts] Look, I've got some good news
about your case. Um...

10:31.172 --> 10:35.009
[sighs] If we can get a plea deal,
I think we can get you probation.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.221
Okay. Well, there's been
a change of plans.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.933
Rooster stole the generator.

10:43.017 --> 10:48.522
[clicks tongue] Whoa. Now, even if he did,
you forgot the magic word: allegedly.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.400
Rooster allegedly stole the generator.

10:51.984 --> 10:55.946
Okay. Uh, what would he be looking at
if he allegedly turned himself in?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.324
Well, now you're just using it wrong.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.368
[chuckles] Um...

11:00.451 --> 11:05.164
It would be tougher, because Rooster
has a lot of priors. He stole a car.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.666
[stutters] He had to steal it.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.751
Arby's won't let you
walk through the drive-thru.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.713
You know, with his history,
even with a favorable plea deal,

11:12.797 --> 11:16.175
probably looking at six months
to a year of jail time.

11:16.258 --> 11:19.136
This is bullshit.
I got these charges dropped.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.806
My dad got them re-charged.
Isn't that double jeopardy?

11:21.889 --> 11:22.723
No.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.267
What is it? Like a discount double check?

11:26.894 --> 11:28.396
Sure, that's what it is.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.482
Um, listen, we can fight it.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.609
It's gonna be very expensive,

11:33.692 --> 11:37.446
but as someone looking
at a new snowmobile, I say we fight it.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.490
If we had the money,

11:39.573 --> 11:41.992
we wouldn't have had to steal a generator
in the first place.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.870
[stammering] He can't go to jail.
We've got too much work to do.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.580
We gotta get the cattle to market.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.458
I need his help to rebuild my house
for when my baby comes.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.793
Plus, if Rooster went to jail,

11:50.876 --> 11:53.254
people would be fighting over
who gets to sit on that beard.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.259
Hey.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.552
Hey, man.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.430
Where's your brother?

12:02.513 --> 12:05.516
Oh, he went out to get
his concealed weapons permit.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.768
You know, so he can walk around
with his hands in his pockets.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.562
Cool.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.774
Well, when you see him,
tell him I said hey.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.194
All right.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.407
That guy's creepy.

12:21.991 --> 12:22.867
Right?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.578
You think he knows my name?

12:26.829 --> 12:30.082
I don't know, but I'm gonna get him
my business card,

12:30.166 --> 12:32.626
[chuckles] 'cause he seems like
the kinda guy

12:32.710 --> 12:34.879
that might just get me that snowmobile.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.301
So, we move forward
with you stealing the generator.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.385
Allegedly.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.763
No, it's a plea deal.
You're accepting guilt.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.766
You're my lawyer.
As long as you understand everything.

12:48.350 --> 12:52.646
No, actually, it's very important
that you understand everything.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.691
I understand. Allegedly.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.705
-Hey, Beau.
-Hey, Lisa. Sorry I'm late.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.541
Actually, you are exactly on time.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.295
Early is on time. On time is late.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.631
That must run in the family.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.592
Now, Rooster was on time
every day he worked for us.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.888
Now, he was hungover and passed out
on the desk, but on time.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.140
Yeah. Sit.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.978
That north pasture is all
cleared out for you.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.730
Bring on your cattle.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.525
That is great news,
because they're on their way.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.152
Do you know, I feel kinda bad.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.988
Highway 111 goes right by
the slaughterhouse,

13:43.072 --> 13:45.282
the Sizzler, and then Outback Steakhouse.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.410
I like to think they know
how delicious they are.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.370
[Lisa chuckles]

13:50.120 --> 13:51.789
You said you had a favor to ask me.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.417
Yeah. I was wondering if I could borrow
a few of your men today.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.002
I'll pay whatever's fair.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.713
You can borrow as many men
for as long as you need 'em.

13:59.797 --> 14:03.676
There's no charge, Beau. Why?
Is there something wrong with your boys?

14:03.759 --> 14:06.011
Everything's wrong with my boys.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.639
If this has something to do
with that generator,

14:08.722 --> 14:10.641
I really didn't mean to cause trouble.

14:10.724 --> 14:15.646
Please. They stole from you.
They deserve whatever's coming to 'em.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.732
They weren't raised well enough.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.527
Clearly, the only one at fault here
is my ex-wife.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.864
Hey, whatever you need, you got it.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.741
There is something else.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.579
Last spring, your company wanted
to buy the Peterson Ranch.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.748
-You still interested?
-Oh, I'd love to buy both your ranches.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.877
Yeah, and I'd love to go hunting
with Clint Eastwood,

14:37.960 --> 14:40.129
but some things just aren't on the table.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.506
[clicks tongue]
Well, I don't know Eastwood,

14:42.590 --> 14:46.635
but I can get John Elway to serve you
a hot dog at a Broncos game.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.804
-John Elway?
-Mmm-hmm.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.890
Huh.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.601
-No, no.
-[chuckles]

14:53.684 --> 14:55.895
The Iron River Ranch isn't for sale.

14:56.854 --> 15:00.691
But that Peterson Ranch has been
a pain in my ass ever since I got it.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.735
I am absolutely interested.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.903
I'll go and check the place out

15:03.986 --> 15:05.696
and then I'll come back to you
with an offer.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.240
Great. I'll wait to hear from you.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.117
-Have a good one.
-You, too.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.038
-Hey, Lisa.
-Yeah.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.791
You think John would bring me a Coors
with that hot dog?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.335
Oh, I'm sure he would.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.128
Hmm.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.172
No, no.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.257
It's not for sale.

15:30.679 --> 15:33.724
Mary, can I get another one?
Hank, what you want?

15:33.807 --> 15:37.019
Well, I was gonna start P90X today.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.981
But I guess it's four beers
before noon again.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.652
Why aren't you at work?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.862
Oh, shit.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.038
Well, Dad got pissed at me and Colt today,
so he gave us the day off.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.415
I gotta remember to piss him off again
in two weeks.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.043
WrestleMania's coming to the Pepsi Center.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.880
Mmm. Monster trucks this weekend,
WrestleMania in two weeks.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.132
I think America is great again.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.550
[chuckles]

16:09.134 --> 16:13.555
You know, I just so happen to have
reinforced that loft this morning.

16:14.264 --> 16:19.019
It is now rated for me, you
and a friend of yours of my choosing.

16:19.103 --> 16:19.979
[Mary chuckles]

16:21.897 --> 16:27.277
Yeah, about last night. I, uh...
I gotta figure out what I'm doing.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.404
[Rooster] Mmm.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.531
What's to figure out?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.574
I'm hot. You're hot.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.702
Your friend Shelly's kinda hot.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.747
Look, I say I wanna give
things with Nick a real shot,

16:38.831 --> 16:40.207
and then I end up at your place.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.626
I can't keep doing this.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.963
Okay. Okay.

16:46.046 --> 16:49.883
Well, yeah. I can, uh...
take a step back, you know?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.301
Turn down the charm.

16:51.885 --> 16:55.014
Throw you a life jacket so you don't drown
in these baby blues.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.852
Or I can think of another option.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.687
Yeah? What's that?

17:01.770 --> 17:04.898
[clicks tongue]
Well, you could dump the ex-con

17:04.982 --> 17:07.443
who's gotta clean trash off the side
of the highway,

17:07.943 --> 17:10.654
for the guy who throws it there
to begin with.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.699
You wanna get back together?

17:15.659 --> 17:19.413
I don't know. Why not?
We had a good thing going.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.459
You're a cool chick, and what can I say?

17:23.959 --> 17:25.711
You make me wanna be a badder badass.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.256
And I know you well enough to know

17:29.339 --> 17:31.216
that statement somehow
means something to you.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.468
[Rooster chuckles]

17:34.678 --> 17:35.637
How about I let you know?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.640
Okay. Just don't wait too long.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.393
If <i>The Bachelor</i> responds to
my audition tape,

17:41.477 --> 17:42.603
I'm gonna fuckin' take it.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.937
[chuckles]

17:46.940 --> 17:47.775
[Abby] <i>Hey, baby.</i>

17:47.858 --> 17:49.943
[Colt] Hey! I miss you.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.071
Are you wearing a towel?

17:52.613 --> 17:54.531
<i>Yeah. I just got out of the shower.</i>

17:55.157 --> 17:57.409
<i>Tilting your phone will not</i>
<i>show you my boobs.</i>

17:57.493 --> 17:58.410
[chuckles]

17:58.994 --> 18:00.412
Tilt your phone, then.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.333
[Abby]<i> Where are you?</i>
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

18:04.416 --> 18:08.378
Oh, I'm over at the Peterson place.
Almost got it cleared out.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.755
It's starting to come along pretty great.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.800
<i>What was that?</i>

18:12.883 --> 18:15.052
Nothin'. I'm good.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.346
Uh... Hey, uh...

18:18.222 --> 18:19.932
I was talking to Jerry, um...

18:20.015 --> 18:26.021
and, uh, Rooster's gonna get jail time,
but I'll only get probation, so...

18:26.105 --> 18:27.564
<i>Oh, damn it, Colt.</i>

18:27.648 --> 18:31.401
It's not that big of a deal.
It means that, at first sign of a cop,

18:31.485 --> 18:33.403
I gotta throw my beer can
out the car window.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.991
Hey, uh, quick question. [stammering]

18:38.075 --> 18:41.829
If a nail's not rusty, uh,
do you have to get a tetanus shot?

18:42.871 --> 18:43.705
[Lisa] Hello!

18:45.124 --> 18:46.750
Oh, uh...

18:46.834 --> 18:49.545
Ms. Neumann, um...
Hey, babe, can I call you back?

18:50.087 --> 18:51.130
[Abby] <i>Yeah, okay. Love you.</i>

18:51.213 --> 18:54.091
Yeah, all right. And seriously,
text me about that nail thing.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.594
-Hey, Colt.
-Hey.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.429
I love what you've done with the place.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.809
Yeah. It's like one of them, uh,
Property Brothers was an arsonist, huh?

19:03.892 --> 19:05.227
Hmm.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.854
Oh, no!

19:06.937 --> 19:07.813
Are you all right?

19:07.896 --> 19:09.898
[scoffs] My lululemons!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.693
It looks like you're cut pretty bad.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.737
I'm fine. I'll heal,
but these are discontinued.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.825
Look, Colt, uh,
I'm glad I ran into you. I'm...

19:20.325 --> 19:23.036
I'm really sorry about
all that generator stuff that...

19:23.120 --> 19:27.249
I thought we were good,
but then your dad had a different opinion.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.043
Oh, yeah, that...
My dad, he don't have opinions. [sighs]

19:30.127 --> 19:33.255
There's the truth and then the bullshit
everybody else believes, so...

19:34.715 --> 19:36.967
What are you doing over here?

19:37.050 --> 19:38.802
I just came to check the place out.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.263
-Check it out for what?
-Well...

19:41.346 --> 19:43.765
your dad told me that you guys
were thinking about selling it.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.933
He said what?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.185
[chuckles]

19:46.268 --> 19:48.520
Look, either you guys have to
start talking to each other,

19:48.604 --> 19:50.397
or I gotta stop talking to you.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.649
You've gotta fucking be kidding me.

19:53.317 --> 19:57.529
Oh, uh, don't step over there.
Or there. Or there.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.328
[exhales]

20:04.411 --> 20:06.079
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.582
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.876
I lost most of my hair products
in the fire,

20:10.959 --> 20:14.338
but fortunately, Colt has enough
to start a Sally Beauty Supply.

20:15.964 --> 20:16.924
How'd it go today?

20:17.507 --> 20:21.178
It went great.
Lisa's got a hell of a crew.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.557
And not one of 'em smelled
like berry hibiscus conditioner.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.642
[Joanne chuckles]

20:26.725 --> 20:28.936
-Did you see Colt and Rooster?
-Nope.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.271
Like I said, it was a great day.

20:32.564 --> 20:36.902
Beau, it's none of my business, but, uh,
how long you gonna keep up this fight?

20:38.528 --> 20:40.656
You know,
there are some parts in the world

20:40.739 --> 20:44.284
where they cut off a man's hand
for stealing.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.872
So when you go to shake a man's hand
and he doesn't have one,

20:48.956 --> 20:51.166
you know not to do business with him.

20:52.876 --> 20:55.462
Well, if I cut things off my daughter
every time she stole something,

20:55.545 --> 20:57.965
I'd be pulling her around
in a little wagon.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.759
They went about it the wrong way,

21:00.842 --> 21:02.886
but they were trying
to do the right thing.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.933
So, I shouldn't punish 'em?
Just let 'em off the hook?

21:08.016 --> 21:09.559
Well, you don't have to
let them off the hook,

21:09.643 --> 21:12.562
but don't make 'em walk around
with nubs for hands.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.316
Might be the only thing
to make 'em listen.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.527
Hard to open a beer without fingers.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.990
Beau, I know you're upset, but I'm...
I'm just not sure you're being reasonable.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.867
We should just drop this.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.663
Oh, really? That's your solution?
Just not to talk about it?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.917
You know when you said
maybe this wasn't any of your business?

21:35.168 --> 21:36.086
Maybe you were right.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.172
Oh, well, good. That's good to know.
Good to know where I stand.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.674
-I'm sorry. I just--
-No, no.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.759
I'll just come home to a place
that isn't mine,

21:42.843 --> 21:44.428
and I'll ignore all the fighting

21:44.511 --> 21:46.305
and I won't have an opinion
about anything.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.766
-So you're leavin'?
-I'm going to work.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.520
At least there, when people are assholes,
I can do stuff to their food.

22:04.531 --> 22:05.657
[wood clattering]

22:07.576 --> 22:09.161
Are you selling the Peterson place?

22:10.245 --> 22:11.079
Yep.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.373
So you're just gonna sell my ranch
right out from under me?

22:13.457 --> 22:16.251
It's not your ranch, it's mine.
I'll do whatever the hell I want with it.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.794
You're doing this out of spite.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.839
It's not even a good business decision.
We're a month away from market.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.175
Oh, you're gonna give me business advice?

22:23.258 --> 22:25.427
You buying that ranch
almost bankrupted us.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.553
But it didn't!

22:26.636 --> 22:30.223
And now you're gonna sell it right before
it pays off, 'cause of a stupid generator?

22:30.307 --> 22:32.476
-A stolen generator.
-I didn't steal it!

22:32.559 --> 22:35.854
I told Rooster to take it back.
I was trying to help him out.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.607
Well, here's a new one.
It's not your fault.

22:38.690 --> 22:42.861
Yeah, well, see, with you,
there's no way to win.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.696
What were we supposed to do?

22:45.322 --> 22:48.909
Rooster couldn't fix the old one,
so he's a failure.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.162
If we borrow one,
you're saying we're taking handouts.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.080
If I come to you for money,

22:53.163 --> 22:55.582
you're gonna tell us we don't have any
'cause we wasted it all.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.794
Every choice we make is wrong.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.630
That's the first thing you've said
that I agree with.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.341
'Cause you make it impossible
to be right!

23:04.424 --> 23:06.343
It's been that way my whole life.

23:06.426 --> 23:09.888
In the conference final game,
I threw five touchdown passes

23:09.971 --> 23:13.016
in a game that we won in a blowout.

23:13.892 --> 23:18.146
In the parking lot, after the game,
instead of just saying, "Good job, son..."

23:20.065 --> 23:24.027
you gave me a lecture
about the one interception that I threw.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.158
Everything I ever did for you boys was
to try to make you better.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.120
Has it worked?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.206
Do you think we're better?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.167
Obviously, you don't.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.421
Maybe that just means you're the one
that did the terrible job.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.090
Watch it there, bub.

23:45.173 --> 23:49.427
You think we're shitty sons?
Maybe you're just a lousy father.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.391
Oh, by the way...

23:55.559 --> 23:56.852
you're having a granddaughter.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.528
[Rooster sighs]

24:13.201 --> 24:14.536
[sighs]

24:18.165 --> 24:19.207
Hey, Rooster.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.501
Welcome home.
