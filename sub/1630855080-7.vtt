I will not let that happen."

Really.

it's like y-you're decided

FUBKs. Yes.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.085
Wait, those guys are real?

02:49.085 --> 02:51.254
- Val: Francisco Boya.
- NoHo Hank: Wow

02:51.254 --> 02:52.589
Val:
Weapons expert.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.007
Used to run missions
for the Clateen cartel.

- NoHo Hank: This is nice.
- Val: Prefers to use a knife

Feel free to blow up cars.
Fuches, obviously. Right?

03:05.435 --> 03:08.271

Fuches with dynamite

your accomplishments.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.533
That's still a shitload
of coups, Todd.

Make that 501.

Okay, so when can we expect

Val:
EOD.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.340
And what does that mean?

03:35.340 --> 03:38.384
- Val: End of the day.
- Okay, then just say
"end of day," alright?

03:38.384 --> 03:41.471
You're not Special Forces
like Isiah Ransone over here.

"The Hollywood Reporter"

06:16.959 --> 06:18.711
about Warner Brothers
being such a dickhead

06:27.678 --> 06:30.098
Hey. Not interested.

Matt:
<i>My client is
Daniel Day-Lewis.</i>

06:34.519 --> 06:36.604
From "My Left Foot"?

Daniel Day-Lewis.</i>

I have a meeting,

08:14.952 --> 08:17.163
Go to my house,

08:17.163 --> 08:19.707
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.418
- Do you remember the address?
- Sally: <i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

08:22.418 --> 08:24.503

08:30.551 --> 08:31.761

Look, we need to find a way
to get to Cousineau's.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.473
He's an old friend of mine.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.516
We're gonna meet
your daddy there, okay?

08:37.516 --> 08:39.352
- And once we find him...
- (plane approaching)

08:39.352 --> 08:41.854
- ...everything's gonna
be okay. Okay?
- (plane roaring)

08:41.854 --> 08:44.941
Come on. Come on, come on!

08:44.941 --> 08:48.694
(plane fading)

08:49.320 --> 08:51.697
I got your text!

08:51.697 --> 08:53.241
What's the word
on the FUBKs?

08:53.241 --> 08:55.785
They landed
about an hour ago.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.745
We lost communication
with them.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.415
Okay...

09:01.415 --> 09:03.626
Can you find communication?

09:03.626 --> 09:04.627
Val:
We, uh,

09:04.627 --> 09:07.630
we just got a delivery.
From Fuches.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.851
- It's their heads.
- We don't know that yet.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.855
(cardboard rustling)

09:26.524 --> 09:27.733
It's a head.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.611
I can, uh, find
a couple more FUBKs.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.864
FUBKs don't just grow out of
the ground like mint, okay?

09:33.864 --> 09:35.950
(sighs) It's another head.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.411
I will go alone and, uh,

09:38.411 --> 09:39.870
avenge the FUBKs for--

09:39.870 --> 09:42.373
Oh, yeah? You're gonna go
on a suicide mission, Val, huh?

09:42.373 --> 09:45.167
Listen, I need you, okay?
You're my support system.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.962
- Why am I still opening these?
- (sighs) Thank God.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.965
- (cardboard rustling)
- Ah, Isiah!

09:51.841 --> 09:54.468
Fuck. Even in death,

09:54.468 --> 09:56.470
just an absolute fox.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.306
Accomplice:
Can I make a suggestion?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.516
I think getting the monsters
out of the house

10:00.516 --> 10:02.435
is more important
than the house.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.440
You know what?
You're absolutely
fucking right.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.359
Fuck that house.
It is dead to us.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.653
Let's take care
of this shit ourselves.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.157
Let's ride.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.327
(mop squishing)

10:20.953 --> 10:24.165
Fuches:
I understand what you guys
witnessed earlier today

10:24.165 --> 10:27.668
was upsetting.
That true?

10:28.836 --> 10:30.963
What about it upsets you?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.217
You cutting off their heads.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.094
I see. Well...

10:38.179 --> 10:40.389
The Raven's flock
are blood artists.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.558
We are modern-day
barbarians.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.895
Our clay
are the beating hearts
of our enemy.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.522
No, yeah, you've told us
this a number of times.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.067
Right, right,
but me saying it

10:51.067 --> 10:52.568
and you saying it,
two different things.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.195
- That's right.
- Fuches: Yeah.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.529
(inhales)

10:55.529 --> 10:57.198
Shit. Okay.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.618
Well, should've thought
this out more.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.370
(sucks teeth)

11:03.245 --> 11:05.539
- May I make a suggestion?
- Fuches: Mm-hmm.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.874
Next time we
capture enemies,

11:06.874 --> 11:09.835
I or one of the guys
take the ladies
out for a meal,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.338
so they're not here
when shit goes down.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.341
Nice. It's a nice idea.
Delightful meal.

11:15.591 --> 11:19.011
And when you come back,
it's all cleaned up.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.347
Yo, that was, like,
a sneak attack, though.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.973
I-I'm not trying
to be all whatever,

11:22.973 --> 11:25.643
- but can't really, like,
plan for those.
- Right. I get it. Right, right.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.478
(clicks tongue)
Yo, what about, uh,

11:27.478 --> 11:29.605
like, noise-canceling
headphones?

11:29.605 --> 11:31.273
(Fuches sighs)

11:32.566 --> 11:34.693
You could put on a movie.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.697
But those guys were
screaming really loud.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.075
You could just
put the volume up.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.869
If it's a
"Fast and Furious,"
you won't hear shit.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.832
That's not gonna
drown out dudes gettin'
their heads cut off.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.042
The one with the planes
on the runway.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.003
I saw it in the theaters,
and my ears
are ringing for days.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.297
What, was that "Tokyo Drift"?
Is that the one
with Lil' Bow Wow?

11:55.297 --> 11:57.383
No, it's "Furious 6."
Uh, came out, like, 2013.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.676
- Six? I didn't see Six.
- That's the one

11:58.676 --> 12:00.469
where Toretto comes out
the front of the plane--

12:00.469 --> 12:02.847
It doesn't matter.
They're all loud.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.099
You gotta have a legit soundbar
if you want that to work, dude.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.351
Soundbar or no soundbar,
the movie is loud.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.646
Okay, <i>muchacho...</i>
(speaking Spanish)

12:10.646 --> 12:14.233
..."Fast <i>y</i> Furious"...
(continues in Spanish)

12:14.233 --> 12:16.444
Okay?
(speaking Spanish)

12:21.365 --> 12:24.076
I still think
I can time it
where we get them

12:24.076 --> 12:27.455
out of the house
for a nice meal
before shit goes down.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.750
- (birds chirping)
- (stream flowing)

12:46.599 --> 12:49.143
Gene Cousineau?
Matt Iserson.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.353
Pretend you don't know me.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.607
Um...

12:55.983 --> 12:57.193
Uh-- (clears throat)

12:57.193 --> 12:59.361
Daniel hasn't been this
excited about a role in ages--

12:59.361 --> 13:01.947
Act like you're talking
on your phone.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.741
(sighs)

13:05.493 --> 13:06.577
(sighs)

13:09.538 --> 13:13.292
Daniel really
loved the complexity
of your character.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.712
The, uh, pathos, the courage,
the huge personality.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.088
I-It's the total package.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.674
But, i-in today's landscape, unfortunately,

13:20.674 --> 13:22.384
Daniel's not enough.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.512
It's why we need to attach
another big name

13:24.512 --> 13:27.181
- for the role of Berkman.
- Are you telling me

13:27.181 --> 13:29.141
that Daniel can't
get a movie made?

13:29.141 --> 13:32.061
Not a theater movie.
Maybe a phone movie.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.897
But, I think this story is big.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.358
- I-It's not small.
- Yeah, right.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.152
And I have a client
who wants to play Barry.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.363
Mark Wahlberg.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.323
Mark Wahlberg?

13:45.324 --> 13:46.909
Are you shitting me?

13:46.909 --> 13:49.119
Well, we ran this through
our marketing division,

13:49.119 --> 13:50.788
and if we brought Mark on,

13:50.788 --> 13:53.165
the studios would be in
a bidding war tomorrow.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.333
Hm...

13:55.084 --> 13:56.335
Well,

13:56.335 --> 13:58.921
this would be a great way
to get Janice's story out there.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.548
- Matt: It would,
and that's what we hope.
- Yeah.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.050
But we do have one problem
with Mark, though.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.553
He doesn't wanna play
a cop killer.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.472
And seeing
as this Berkman guy
killed your girlfriend,

14:08.472 --> 14:10.182
that's a no-go.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.689
Look, Barry is a very,
uh, complicated guy,

14:16.689 --> 14:19.400
but a sympathetic soul.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.859
You know, it, it...

14:20.859 --> 14:22.486
He loves my character so much,

14:22.486 --> 14:25.489
it made him do
stupid things, like...

14:25.489 --> 14:27.241
killing my girlfriend.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.492
- Really?
- Gene: Yeah.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.870
Because Mark is concerned
h-he's kind of a villain.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.497
(inhales)

14:33.998 --> 14:37.793
But he was so desperate
to have a father figure.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.715
Mark will relate to that,
and Daniel will know

14:42.715 --> 14:44.133
exactly what to do
with my character.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.802
Matt:
Oh God. (laughs)
He'll kill it. Mm.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.887
Look.

14:48.887 --> 14:52.016
There is so much more
than people know.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.559
I mean, what you think
you've seen,

14:53.559 --> 14:55.144
what you think you've heard,

14:55.144 --> 14:58.564
it is only the tip
of the iceberg.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.859
This is not
a good-guy, bad-guy story.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.238
It goes way deeper than that.
S-So much deeper.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.534
Well, Mark wants this role
before it goes on the market,

15:10.534 --> 15:12.995
so he's willing to come on
as a producer.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.455
Anything to lock it down.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.249
- How would you feel
about meeting with him?
- Would he come here?

15:17.249 --> 15:19.126
In the woods?
No. No, no.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.753
He's very frightened
of the woods.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.672
He'd like to meet you
at the Four Seasons.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.174
In Beverly Hills.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.221
(muffled rock music playing)

15:35.601 --> 15:37.728
(car doors shut)

15:40.064 --> 15:41.148

16:08.092 --> 16:10.010
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on.
Here you go. Here you go.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.720
- Yeah. Okay.
- Come on. There you go.
Put it in.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.639
Eat your food.
Eat your food.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.140
NoHo Hank:
Okay.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.018
One. Two. Three.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.897

16:21.897 --> 16:24.316

Whoa... Hey!

16:24.316 --> 16:26.068
- What was that?
- (distant explosion)

16:26.068 --> 16:28.654
- NoHo Hank: Hm.
- What the fuck was that?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.447
Alright, well,
load up the next one.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.949
This was it. Only one.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.909
You thought we were
gonna get it
on the first fucking try?

16:33.909 --> 16:36.370
Well, these are
very expensive.
I'm thinking budget.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.413
Entourage:
Hey, asshole!

16:37.413 --> 16:39.039
- (gunfire)
- Shit. Shit. Okay.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.291
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
That didn't work. Let's--

16:41.291 --> 16:43.836
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
Let's go!
- (bullets hitting car)

16:43.836 --> 16:47.047
- Thank you. Thank you!
- (car door opens, shuts)

16:47.047 --> 16:49.591

<i>Oh shit! Call them off!</i>

17:18.704 --> 17:20.956
Fuches:
Why are you shootin'
rockets at my house?

17:20.956 --> 17:22.541
NoHo Hank:
<i>Fucking call them off!</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:24.960
Fuches:
(laughs) You think you can
get rid of me that easy?

17:24.960 --> 17:27.171
- NoHo Hank: <i>You killed
my fucking driver!</i>
- Fuches: No shit.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.506
- Well, you're next, asshole.

Yeah, got him right here.
He's here!

20:03.493 --> 20:06.413
Okay. Thank you, Miss Phoebe,
for letting me use your phone.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.123
- No problem.
- Here. I don't want this.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.753
Hey.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.837
You only gave us one rocket.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.547
You told us
to watch the budget.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.758
Yeah, I was talking
about office supplies.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.801
I see.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.304
This war on Fuches
has entered a new phase.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.805
And what do we
call this phase?

20:23.805 --> 20:27.184
The "give Fuches whatever
he fucking wants" phase.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.227
But Barry can be
anywhere in the world.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.610
Okay, the acting teacher
knows where he is.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.403
Go to his house.
