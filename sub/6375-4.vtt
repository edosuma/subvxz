00:01.223 --> 00:02.622
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.691 --> 00:04.022
<i>You're dating a married man?</i>

00:04.091 --> 00:06.492
I didn't know that he was married
when we started dating...

00:06.561 --> 00:09.622
- This is just gonna end bad.
- Who says it's gonna end?

00:09.699 --> 00:13.396
I know how much you care about me,
and I care about you, too.

00:13.469 --> 00:15.130
But not in that way.

00:15.204 --> 00:16.603
<i>You're a natural father.</i>

00:16.673 --> 00:19.369
His grandparents want him back
in France. I know he misses them.

00:19.442 --> 00:22.673
He can miss them
and still want to be here with his father.

00:22.779 --> 00:24.805
Daniel isn't Daniel Jr. 's father.

00:24.915 --> 00:25.882
I am.

00:27.117 --> 00:31.281
I will not rest until the person who
threatened the life of my unborn child

00:31.355 --> 00:33.687
<i>- is brought to justice.
- I'm afraid you're under arrest.</i>

00:33.757 --> 00:35.384
I didn't push Christina.

00:35.459 --> 00:36.892
I know you did it.

00:38.962 --> 00:42.899
Today the center ring of the Meade
family circus belongs to Alexis Meade,

00:42.967 --> 00:45.333
who's been charged with helping
Wilhelmina Slater's surrogate

00:45.403 --> 00:46.836
<i>down a pesky flight of stairs.</i>

00:47.972 --> 00:48.961
Ouch!

00:50.108 --> 00:51.632
Hold everything!
It looks like Daniel Meade has arrived!

00:52.811 --> 00:56.115
Mr. Meade!
SUZUKl: Make a hole, bitches!

00:56.115 --> 00:59.778
My God, this ordeal has taken
a terrible toll on Daniel Meade.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.843
He looks like some kind
of twisted hunchback.

01:01.954 --> 01:03.182
Look this way!

01:08.994 --> 01:10.724
All right, you guys,
let's go around the back.

01:10.797 --> 01:12.992
- Hi.
- Hey. I'm in.

01:13.266 --> 01:15.257
<i>- Thanks for the diversion.
- Of course.</i>

01:15.335 --> 01:18.395
I think it's great
that you're supporting your sister,

01:18.472 --> 01:21.635
even if she did, you know, push
my best friend down a flight of stairs.

01:21.708 --> 01:24.074
Yeah. Well, I'm still pissed at Alexis
for letting me take the blame.

01:24.144 --> 01:26.579
But Mom wanted me to talk to her,
so here I am.

01:26.814 --> 01:28.941
Well, try and play nice.

01:29.050 --> 01:31.883
Oh, and could I take
the Town Car to work?

01:31.953 --> 01:33.011
<i>No.</i>

01:37.725 --> 01:39.454
You look like crap.

01:40.329 --> 01:43.765
They said my eyebrow pencil
could be used as a shank.

01:44.399 --> 01:45.923
I can see that.

01:47.269 --> 01:48.702
So, I spoke to your lawyer.

01:48.771 --> 01:51.137
He thinks with the plea deal,
you could probably get off with a fine,

01:51.206 --> 01:54.471
a few hundred hours
of community service, and that's it.

01:54.543 --> 01:58.844
I don't know why Mom insisted
I come down here just to tell you that.

01:59.749 --> 02:03.185
It wasn't just to tell me that.
Daniel, I need to talk to you.

02:09.826 --> 02:14.628
Thirteen years ago, when we met
Daniel Jr. 's mother in Paris,

02:15.299 --> 02:18.996
I was obviously still a man,
and the thing is,

02:19.069 --> 02:23.506
- I slept with her. It was just once...
- Why are you telling me this now?

02:26.444 --> 02:29.572
Because I saw the results
of the paternity test,

02:30.982 --> 02:33.507
and you're not Daniel Jr. 's father.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.212
I am.

02:38.557 --> 02:40.923
Look, I'm going to give up
my parental rights.

02:40.992 --> 02:42.392
We can keep this out of the press.

02:42.461 --> 02:45.430
As far as anyone will know,
DJ is your son.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.364
I'm so sorry, Daniel.

02:53.873 --> 02:56.570
Is there anything
you want to say to me?

03:03.984 --> 03:07.010
<i>I think it shows real maturity
that Daniel is helping Alexis.</i>

03:07.888 --> 03:09.913
He's totally growing as a person.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.492
Okay, Betty, what time are you
getting home from work tonight?

03:12.594 --> 03:15.461
Oh! I don't know. Like, 7:00. Why?
Do you want to hang out?

03:15.530 --> 03:20.126
Actually, Coach and I were wondering if
we could hang out at your place again.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.566
Hilda! No.

03:21.636 --> 03:25.663
I said you could use my apartment that
one time so that you guys could talk.

03:25.740 --> 03:28.209
I know, but... Excuse me one second.

03:28.277 --> 03:32.270
<i>I know, but papi walked in on us!
We didn't get a chance to talk.</i>

03:32.348 --> 03:35.943
Come on, Betty, please. I really need
to find out where this is going.

03:36.018 --> 03:38.851
Fine, but I swear after this
I'm changing my locks and...

03:38.921 --> 03:41.446
Oh, my God, Gio's back!

03:41.557 --> 03:43.753
<i>- What?
- Gio's back from Rome!</i>

03:43.860 --> 03:45.919
I can't wait to hear all about his trip.

03:46.029 --> 03:47.553
Well, isn't that gonna be weird?

03:47.664 --> 03:49.154
No. Why would it be weird?

03:49.266 --> 03:51.234
I don't know. Maybe because
he offered to whisk you away

03:51.334 --> 03:54.235
on this romantic trip to Rome
and you threw it in his face.

03:54.304 --> 03:57.068
I did not throw
anything back in his face.

03:57.642 --> 04:01.635
I care about you, Gio,
but I can't go to Rome with you.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.810
Right now, I need to be on my own.

04:04.882 --> 04:09.581
I completely understand.
Have a wonderful trip.

04:11.355 --> 04:13.790
Nope. He was fine!
All right, I'll talk to you later.

04:13.892 --> 04:15.120
<i>Whatever.</i>

04:16.762 --> 04:19.993
<i>Buongiorno! How was your trip?</i>

04:20.065 --> 04:22.829
Was it amazing? Tell me everything!

04:24.803 --> 04:29.832
I'm not telling you nothing.
You and I, we don't talk.

04:32.045 --> 04:33.034
"Banned"?

04:33.780 --> 04:35.645
Gio, what is this?

04:36.249 --> 04:37.682
I thought we were fine.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.844
Fine? After the way we left things?

04:42.121 --> 04:46.252
The truth is, I would rather be all alone
than go to Rome with you.

04:46.527 --> 04:50.190
- I don't understand.
- Well, then, let me make myself clear.

04:52.499 --> 04:54.967
It didn't happen like that,
and I did not spit!

04:55.035 --> 04:58.061
Yeah, well, maybe you don't notice,

04:58.138 --> 05:01.939
but sometimes when you talk really fast
you end up spitting a little bit.

05:03.078 --> 05:05.342
Gio, Gio, stop!

05:07.015 --> 05:10.075
Okay, you want to hear about my trip?

05:10.151 --> 05:14.612
Two weeks in one of the most romantic
places on Earth, and I was alone.

05:14.690 --> 05:17.181
And since your boss
made all the arrangements,

05:17.259 --> 05:19.386
all of the reservations
were under your name.

05:19.462 --> 05:22.920
<i>So everywhere I went, it was,
"Welcome, Signore Suarez.</i>

05:22.999 --> 05:25.024
<i>"Can I get you anything,
Signore Suarez?</i>

05:25.134 --> 05:27.068
<i>"Where's your wife, Signore Suarez?"</i>

05:27.136 --> 05:30.300
There must have been something
good. Right? It was Rome,

05:30.374 --> 05:31.898
and you went to find your flavor,

05:31.975 --> 05:34.739
like Mario Batali.
Did you find your flavor?

05:34.811 --> 05:35.903
I found it all right.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.776
See, there was this cheese,
a scamorza,

05:40.584 --> 05:42.814
made by a farmer named Donato,

05:43.320 --> 05:47.883
and all of the milk from the cheese
came from one cow, Louisa.

05:47.959 --> 05:52.055
He would feed her by hand,
pamper her, massage her.

05:52.530 --> 05:56.466
I know. I know. But the cheese!

05:57.135 --> 06:00.105
Who knew heaven
could come from a cow?

06:00.205 --> 06:03.003
- Not me.
- The sandwiches I was going to make...

06:03.075 --> 06:04.872
That cheese was gonna
change my life.

06:04.943 --> 06:07.537
Life-changing, that's good, right?

06:07.613 --> 06:12.209
But then I landed at JFK
and the customs guys confiscated it.

06:12.418 --> 06:14.511
- Oh.
- Something about food import rules.

06:14.586 --> 06:18.580
Oh, God, Gio, that's... I'm so sorry.

06:18.725 --> 06:20.249
It's fine.

06:20.326 --> 06:22.590
See, as I sat there

06:22.662 --> 06:26.894
watching them eat
my once-in-a-lifetime discovery,

06:26.966 --> 06:28.661
I had an epiphany,

06:29.469 --> 06:32.030
a moment of total clarity.

06:33.541 --> 06:35.304
- I hate you.
- What?

06:35.376 --> 06:36.673
You're not a nice person.

06:36.744 --> 06:40.942
Not only are you banned from
Gio's Deli, you're banned from my life.

06:42.683 --> 06:46.552
Gio, you can't ban me from your life!

06:47.089 --> 06:49.250
I am a very nice person.

06:49.591 --> 06:51.218
And you know what?
You can't hate me,

06:52.227 --> 06:53.524
because we're friends!

07:01.137 --> 07:04.538
Oh, my God, he hates me.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:19.756 --> 07:23.157
I can't stand that Gio feels that way.
I should do something,

07:23.227 --> 07:25.092
something to make it up to him.

07:25.162 --> 07:27.790
Wait, have you had your hand
in there this whole time?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.560
Yeah, I just didn't want
to interrupt your rant.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.795
Did you get into a fight?
We talked about that.

07:31.870 --> 07:34.737
- You suck at fighting.
- It wasn't a fight exactly.

07:34.839 --> 07:36.306
- Then what happened?
- Look, you don't have to know

07:36.374 --> 07:38.035
everything that goes on
in my life, Betty.

07:38.143 --> 07:41.169
- Some things are private.
- Oh. Okay. Private.

07:41.279 --> 07:43.873
'Cause the other day, you had me
check a mole on your "lower back,"

07:43.948 --> 07:47.146
but today there are boundaries,
and yay for that.

07:49.088 --> 07:51.955
I gotta go. I'm taking DJ to lunch,

07:52.024 --> 07:53.855
and then I have
my sister's arraignment.

07:53.926 --> 07:55.985
You know, you should probably
just give Gio a little time.

07:56.061 --> 07:58.621
- I'm sure he'll forget about it.
- You don't know Gio.

07:58.697 --> 08:00.790
He gets something in his mind,
he doesn't let it go.

08:00.866 --> 08:05.065
Like this cheese that he found in Italy.
Duh-nut... Do-nutto...

08:05.138 --> 08:07.606
- Donato scamorza?
- Yeah. How did you know?

08:07.707 --> 08:10.938
It's amazing. My friend Mario
uses it in all his restaurants.

08:11.611 --> 08:14.478
- Mario? Batali?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:14.548 --> 08:16.881
Oh, my God, he's Gio's hero!

08:17.485 --> 08:20.318
Maybe he could
get me some of that cheese,

08:20.388 --> 08:23.721
and then I could give that
to Gio as a peace offering.

08:23.791 --> 08:26.658
You think you could call him for me?

08:26.794 --> 08:28.694
- DJ and I...
- Call him!

08:29.130 --> 08:30.222
Okay.

08:33.702 --> 08:35.260
How is my baby?

08:35.337 --> 08:37.567
I'm fine, Willie.

08:37.639 --> 08:40.403
You know how I get
when you call me that.

08:41.043 --> 08:44.136
Oh. That baby.
Gestating nicely, I'm told.

08:44.246 --> 08:47.614
Though Christina is getting
a little too comfortable at the spa.

08:47.684 --> 08:51.381
She's requested a few extra days
for her and her terminal Scotsman.

08:51.454 --> 08:53.615
Make sure she's aware
her contract with me

08:53.690 --> 08:57.148
specifically limits
extra-curricular womb activities.

08:57.227 --> 08:58.353
Um...

08:58.628 --> 09:01.597
Okay. I will try to tell her that.

09:01.831 --> 09:06.098
So I suppose you've heard.
Alexis got community service.

09:07.304 --> 09:08.737
If I'd known
this is how the system worked,

09:08.806 --> 09:10.171
I'd have tried to kill more often.

09:10.241 --> 09:13.699
She tries to off your offspring and
she gets off with a slap on the wrist.

09:13.777 --> 09:15.267
It's an off-ing outrage!

09:15.379 --> 09:20.010
Or it could be the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.585
Exactly what I was thinking.

09:22.654 --> 09:25.452
Though the fact that
she'll be out before cocktail hour

09:25.523 --> 09:28.822
- does get my dander up.
- My dander is sky high!

09:28.893 --> 09:31.623
Still, I'm not going to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.824
No. You'd be a fool to!

09:34.667 --> 09:36.567
I'm completely lost.
Just tell me what to feel.

09:36.636 --> 09:38.501
Why don't you get
your lips off my ass

09:38.571 --> 09:41.506
and get the DA on the phone?

09:44.410 --> 09:45.468
<i>So, what's going on?</i>

09:45.544 --> 09:47.307
The arraignment was supposed to start
a half an hour ago.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.679
Well, I'm afraid
there's been a little hiccup.

09:49.783 --> 09:54.516
Apparently, due to the horrific nature
of your crimes,

09:54.588 --> 09:58.820
blah, blah, blah, the DA is bumping
the charge from misdemeanor assault

10:00.260 --> 10:02.694
- to attempted murder.
- Oh, my God.

10:02.763 --> 10:05.426
They're also insisting that Alexis
be denied bail.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.559
Now what're we going to do?
I thought we had a deal.

10:07.635 --> 10:10.729
I know, I'm trying to see if we can
salvage some kind of plea agreement.

10:10.805 --> 10:12.136
And barring that, we go to trial.

10:12.206 --> 10:15.276
No, I am not putting my daughter's
future into the hands of 12 people

10:15.276 --> 10:18.473
who are too lazy or stupid
to get out of jury duty.

10:18.547 --> 10:22.643
Maybe I should just go to jail.
Maybe I'm getting what I deserve.

10:22.751 --> 10:24.719
- I did a terrible thing.
- Mmm.

10:25.888 --> 10:28.652
That doesn't make you
a terrible person.

10:29.191 --> 10:31.056
Now don't you worry, dear.

10:31.460 --> 10:35.090
I contributed handsomely to the
district attorney's election campaign.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.801
Mommy will make this all better.

10:39.469 --> 10:42.063
Richard, darling, it's Claire Meade.

10:42.138 --> 10:44.038
<i>Claire, you know this is inappropriate.</i>

10:44.107 --> 10:46.735
I can't talk to you while
I'm prosecuting your daughter.

10:46.810 --> 10:49.279
Why don't you reduce the charges

10:49.347 --> 10:51.611
and let Alexis get to picking up trash

10:51.682 --> 10:54.412
along the West Side Highway
like you promised?

10:54.518 --> 10:57.783
She admitted to pushing a
pregnant woman down a flight of stairs.

10:57.888 --> 10:58.946
And your point is?

10:59.056 --> 11:00.853
The point is,
I'm under a lot of pressure.

11:00.925 --> 11:03.291
I can't make it seem that
there's a different standard of justice

11:03.361 --> 11:05.421
- for rich people.
- Funny,

11:05.530 --> 11:07.964
I don't recall justice
being quite so blind

11:08.033 --> 11:10.467
when you were accepting
that obscenely large check

11:10.535 --> 11:12.196
I wrote for your campaign.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.364
Claire, I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

11:18.944 --> 11:22.506
Now, Counselor,
if we have any further interruptions,

11:23.383 --> 11:27.342
I'm going to have to hold you
in contempt.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.146
Yes, Your Honor.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.261
You know,
we could have done this in the park,

11:40.334 --> 11:43.531
like an actual picnic
outside on the grass.

11:43.604 --> 11:46.129
With all the ants and the dog crap?

11:50.111 --> 11:53.979
- What is it?
- I just... I've been thinking about...

11:54.048 --> 11:57.882
- About this.
- Indoor picnics? Dog crap?

11:57.952 --> 12:00.386
No, wise guy, about us.

12:00.422 --> 12:04.188
About sneaking around
and using my sister's apartment.

12:04.259 --> 12:05.727
And what if Justin finds out
that you're married?

12:05.828 --> 12:07.090
- I mean, where is this going?
- I'm leaving her.

12:07.163 --> 12:08.687
Let me finish!

12:10.666 --> 12:12.463
Wait, what'd you say?

12:13.269 --> 12:16.338
Tony, don't mess with me.
I swear to God...

12:16.338 --> 12:19.171
It's no joke.
I'm telling her this afternoon.

12:19.241 --> 12:23.042
No more sneaking around.
No more dates in the back of the car.

12:23.113 --> 12:25.673
My dad will be happy to know
I'm not gonna burn in hell.

12:25.749 --> 12:28.980
No eternal damnation,
always a good thing.

13:04.990 --> 13:09.451
Hey, Betty, a pair of sweaty,
smelly balls arrived for you.

13:10.630 --> 13:12.325
- Yay!
- Is this your lunch?

13:12.432 --> 13:15.833
No, it's for Gio,
and, no, you can't have any.

13:16.069 --> 13:21.407
That's too bad.
One slice of that fatness,

13:21.407 --> 13:23.308
or 10 of these.

13:28.082 --> 13:30.107
- I totally win.
- Excuse me,

13:30.217 --> 13:31.684
could you direct me to
Daniel Meade's office?

13:31.752 --> 13:34.243
Yes, Counselor Adams. Follow me.

13:34.989 --> 13:37.925
- Oh, my God, is that Donato scamorza?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:42.497 --> 13:46.126
We need to discuss
the custody hearing for Daniel Jr.

13:46.501 --> 13:48.230
Why? You're not handling that.

13:48.303 --> 13:50.328
I asked Getman at the firm
to let me step in.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.168
I feel bad about your sister.

13:52.241 --> 13:55.802
I just want to knock one of them
out of the park for you.

13:55.878 --> 14:00.815
There we go. Anyway, now,
you remember that the grandparents

14:01.284 --> 14:04.151
of the boy in France
filed a petition for custody.

14:04.220 --> 14:05.983
Getman told me not to worry about it.

14:06.055 --> 14:07.717
Well, that was when
we were all under the impression

14:07.791 --> 14:10.157
that you were actually the father.

14:10.227 --> 14:11.785
Feel free to worry about it now.

14:11.895 --> 14:13.886
Wait, they know?
How the hell did they find out?

14:13.964 --> 14:15.761
I thought we were gonna keep this
within the family.

14:15.866 --> 14:20.166
Well, they subpoenaed our evidence,
which included your paternity test.

14:20.237 --> 14:23.537
We'll fight them. Right?
I'm still DJ's uncle.

14:23.608 --> 14:26.202
I still care for the kid. I know
I'd make a good dad. Bring them on.

14:26.277 --> 14:28.245
That's the spirit!

14:28.313 --> 14:31.874
But the thing is that the judge already
awarded them temporary custody.

14:31.950 --> 14:33.440
- What?
- Well, when Alexis relinquished

14:33.518 --> 14:37.545
her parental rights, those
damn Frenchies swooped right in.

14:38.190 --> 14:41.455
In one hour, they're gonna be
at JFK to pick him up.

14:41.527 --> 14:43.051
- Can't we do something?
- Sure, sure, sure.

14:43.128 --> 14:45.961
I've filed a motion to have
the custody order suspended,

14:46.031 --> 14:49.296
but if they get Daniel Jr.
back on French soil,

14:49.401 --> 14:52.302
it doesn't make a difference
how strong our case is.

14:52.371 --> 14:54.670
You can kiss that kid goodbye.

15:01.014 --> 15:02.413
- Betty.
- Oh! Daniel.

15:02.482 --> 15:04.416
I know it's been crazy today,
but I was wondering,

15:04.484 --> 15:05.849
could I leave work a little early?

15:05.919 --> 15:08.650
Perfect. I was just about to ask you
to take care of one little thing for me.

15:08.723 --> 15:10.054
Of course, I just have to get home.

15:10.124 --> 15:11.455
- Not a problem.
- You see,

15:11.525 --> 15:13.925
Gio doesn't know that
I have an apartment in the city,

15:13.995 --> 15:16.293
so I placed this huge sandwich order
from his deli

15:16.364 --> 15:18.127
so that he could deliver it
to my apartment.

15:18.199 --> 15:20.633
- That's brilliant.
- When he shows up,

15:20.735 --> 15:23.839
- I'm going to give him the scamorza.
- It can't miss.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.363
- You're not listening to me.
- No, I'm not.

15:25.474 --> 15:27.874
Listen, I really need you
to pick up DJ after school

15:27.943 --> 15:30.241
- and take him somewhere.
- Where?

15:30.312 --> 15:31.506
I don't know. I don't care. Anywhere.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.377
Actually, it's probably better
if you don't tell me where.

15:33.448 --> 15:36.383
Okay, look, Daniel,
I'm not taking him anywhere

15:36.451 --> 15:38.214
until you tell me what this is about.

15:38.286 --> 15:41.051
Look, DJ's grandparents
are on their way here right now

15:41.124 --> 15:43.592
- to take him back to France.
- How can they even do that?

15:43.660 --> 15:45.321
- You're his father.
- Look, I don't know.

15:45.395 --> 15:48.330
I can't go into the complex
international legal issues right now.

15:48.398 --> 15:50.389
They're French.
They do things differently.

15:50.466 --> 15:52.696
All right, well,
this still sounds a little fishy...

15:52.769 --> 15:56.604
Betty, please.
If you don't do this, I'm gonna lose him.

16:12.557 --> 16:13.922
Gio's Deli!

16:15.660 --> 16:18.595
"B. Suarez"? Oh, crap.

16:19.164 --> 16:21.724
Right on time!
Great service, as always.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.734
- What is this?
- Come in!

16:26.972 --> 16:29.702
What part of "banned"
don't you understand, Suarez?

16:29.809 --> 16:31.174
Banned from the deli.

16:31.243 --> 16:33.404
I thought I still had
some wiggle room on delivery.

16:33.512 --> 16:35.446
- Bon-Gio.
- Hey.

16:35.614 --> 16:37.878
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a business to run.

16:37.950 --> 16:40.545
No, no, no, no, no, no. Gio, please!

16:41.354 --> 16:44.915
I can't let it end this way.
Just listen for a second.

16:45.058 --> 16:49.119
You know, there is nothing that
you can say that could make me...

16:57.171 --> 16:59.765
- What's that smell?
- Heaven from a cow.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.509
Donato scamorza!

17:11.252 --> 17:13.778
- Where'd you get this?
- Well, I have my ways.

17:13.856 --> 17:15.915
And I wanted to do something nice,

17:15.991 --> 17:18.653
you know,
to make up for what happened.

17:21.864 --> 17:22.955
Fine.

17:24.833 --> 17:26.563
- Where are you going?
- Leaving.

17:26.636 --> 17:28.103
But I gave you cheese.

17:28.171 --> 17:31.231
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- You're still angry?

17:31.307 --> 17:32.365
Yep.

17:33.643 --> 17:36.009
Hey! What are you doing?

17:36.479 --> 17:40.347
Give... Don't... Don't squeeze.
Don't squeeze. Give me the...

17:41.585 --> 17:44.418
- Stop being such an Indian giver!
- Okay, first of all,

17:44.488 --> 17:47.457
that is an outdated
and culturally insensitive term,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.686
and second of all,
you are not getting this cheese

17:49.760 --> 17:54.026
until we've sat down and spoken
properly and gotten past this.

18:00.772 --> 18:03.206
<i>Monsieur Meade,
we want to thank you so much</i>

18:03.275 --> 18:05.505
for taking such good care of Daniel.

18:05.577 --> 18:08.068
He says wonderful things about you.

18:08.413 --> 18:11.042
He does?
I mean, you've spoken with him?

18:11.150 --> 18:15.416
Well, yes, he has written us many
letters since he's here in New York.

18:16.088 --> 18:19.524
- I didn't realize.
- No need for letters now.

18:20.359 --> 18:24.489
- His family is here.
- I am his family.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.528
<i>Monsieur Meade,</i>

18:26.600 --> 18:29.694
- we want to take him...
- I'm sorry, it's just...

18:30.370 --> 18:34.466
Since we lost our daughter,
he is all we have.

18:37.911 --> 18:39.401
Where is our grandson?

18:39.479 --> 18:41.744
- We need to take him home.
- He's with my assistant.

18:41.850 --> 18:44.318
Look, I tried to call.
She's just not answering her phone.

18:44.419 --> 18:47.718
If you're looking for Betty,
she's at her apartment.

18:50.558 --> 18:52.048
You're welcome.

18:58.567 --> 19:00.728
This is me rock climbing in Yosemite.

19:00.870 --> 19:05.500
Can you imagine me, Betty Suarez,
hanging off a cliff 50 feet in the air?

19:07.042 --> 19:09.340
<i>- Le Grand Canyon!
- Yeah. That's right!</i>

19:09.411 --> 19:10.844
And we hiked all the way to the bottom.

19:10.913 --> 19:13.542
Did you know that only 1% of visitors
to the Grand Canyon

19:13.617 --> 19:15.278
actually do that?

19:16.219 --> 19:21.156
Right. Well, the important thing is
that I learned that I can do anything,

19:21.258 --> 19:24.193
and even the things that terrified me.

19:24.261 --> 19:26.991
And that's all thanks to you, Gio!

19:27.063 --> 19:30.397
You were always pushing me
to take risks.

19:30.468 --> 19:32.333
You changed my life.

19:34.939 --> 19:39.000
So, breaking up with me
made your life better.

19:39.110 --> 19:43.241
What? No!
No, you're taking this all wrong!

19:43.315 --> 19:45.180
No, no, I don't think so.

19:45.250 --> 19:49.277
You know, this isn't about
you making me feel better.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.050
This is about you feeling better
about yourself.

19:52.157 --> 19:53.454
If you were listening

19:53.525 --> 19:56.460
- to what I'm trying to tell you...
- But I have been listening!

19:56.528 --> 19:59.327
I've been listening to you talk
for about a half an hour

19:59.399 --> 20:01.924
about what great friends we are.

20:02.001 --> 20:06.131
About how I changed your life by
sending you on this mountain-climbing,

20:06.205 --> 20:09.572
river-rafting,
clam chowder-eating vision quest.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.110
But for once, this isn't about you,

20:12.178 --> 20:14.670
and if you didn't live
in Betty Suarez Land...

20:14.748 --> 20:18.013
Okay.
I do not live in "Betty Suarez Land"!

20:18.085 --> 20:20.110
Yes, you do.

20:20.554 --> 20:25.355
25 Teddy Bear Lane,
Betty Suarez Land, USA!

20:25.726 --> 20:27.853
And if you were to step out of it
for one minute,

20:27.962 --> 20:30.932
you'd realize that it takes two
to make a relationship,

20:30.999 --> 20:32.899
- and I'm not interested!
- Well, why not?

20:32.968 --> 20:35.061
Because you broke my heart!

20:43.980 --> 20:47.609
I'm sorry, I... I have to. Yes?

20:47.683 --> 20:49.913
<i>Betty, DJ's grandparents
found out where you are.</i>

20:49.986 --> 20:51.044
What? DJ.

20:52.288 --> 20:54.313
Look, they're coming to get him.
You have to get out of there.

20:54.390 --> 20:56.551
Daniel, what is going on?

20:58.060 --> 21:00.029
<i>Is Betty Suarez there?</i>

21:00.197 --> 21:03.428
<i>Hello? I need to speak
to Betty Suarez right now!</i>

21:03.467 --> 21:04.934
They're here.

21:07.971 --> 21:10.235
<i>Betty, what's happening?
I know you're up there.</i>

21:10.307 --> 21:12.605
I'm not going to let you take him away!

21:12.676 --> 21:16.272
- Daniel, it's them, they're here!
- Betty, get out of there! Just leave!

21:16.347 --> 21:19.407
- He's up there now, isn't he? Let me in!
- Okay.

21:20.418 --> 21:23.581
- No! No, no, no!
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

21:24.789 --> 21:26.882
Daniel's about to lose custody
of his son.

21:26.958 --> 21:29.621
His grandparents are coming
from France to take him back.

21:29.728 --> 21:31.696
How can they do that
if Daniel's the father?

21:31.764 --> 21:34.824
I don't know! It's a French thing!
Look, where's your van, downstairs?

21:34.933 --> 21:36.901
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:37.002 --> 21:39.129
You're not expecting me
to drive you anywhere?

21:39.204 --> 21:43.800
Gio, I know you hate me, but please
don't take it out on Daniel or his son.

21:46.246 --> 21:50.273
Hey, DJ, ever been on
a real live New York fire escape?

21:50.350 --> 21:52.511
<i>L'escapé flambé, come on!</i>

22:04.865 --> 22:07.425
The prison reality
is not living up to my fantasy at all.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.003
Where is all the scary beefy trade?

22:10.071 --> 22:12.437
- Marc, we're in a women's prison.
- I know.

22:18.747 --> 22:21.944
I'm surprised you wanted to see me,
Wilhelmina, after what I've done.

22:22.017 --> 22:24.850
<i>What would the world be
without the power to forgive?</i>

22:24.953 --> 22:26.887
And in the interest of forgiveness,

22:26.955 --> 22:30.448
<i>I may have a way to help
put this nightmare behind you.</i>

22:30.526 --> 22:31.720
What do you mean?

22:31.794 --> 22:36.493
Let's just say the district attorney
and I share certain enthusiasms.

22:37.166 --> 22:41.603
I could talk to him about reducing
these outrageous charges against you.

22:42.939 --> 22:44.429
<i>You did this.</i>

22:44.941 --> 22:47.570
<i>You got him to charge me
with attempted murder.</i>

22:47.644 --> 22:49.771
<i>Don't act so shocked, Alexis.</i>

22:49.847 --> 22:53.305
This is what we do. This is our thing.
You screw me over, I screw you back.

22:53.383 --> 22:55.783
<i>A whole lot of screwing going around.</i>

22:55.853 --> 22:58.686
<i>The point is,
I can make this whole thing go away.</i>

23:01.993 --> 23:03.517
<i>And what's it going to cost me?</i>

23:03.595 --> 23:05.563
<i>Your shares in Meade Publishing.</i>

23:05.630 --> 23:09.396
What? I'm not going to give you
control of my family's company.

23:09.501 --> 23:12.629
<i>- How can you even ask me that?
- I'm just saying.</i>

23:12.770 --> 23:15.603
<i>You're the one
with the guilty conscience.</i>

23:18.677 --> 23:20.975
<i>I'm terrified of going to prison,</i>

23:21.046 --> 23:24.743
<i>more scared than I've ever been
in my entire life,</i>

23:25.651 --> 23:29.781
<i>but I'll do 100 years before
I screw my brother over again.</i>

23:30.589 --> 23:32.217
So, thank you for the offer,

23:32.292 --> 23:35.693
<i>but this time you can screw yourself.</i>

23:42.802 --> 23:45.396
<i>Are you being followed?
I don't know.</i>

23:45.805 --> 23:47.671
Are we being followed?

23:55.249 --> 23:56.682
- Nope.
- No.

23:56.918 --> 23:58.681
<i>- So where are you heading?
- I don't know.</i>

23:58.753 --> 24:00.721
Where should we take him?
Does he like the ballet?

24:00.855 --> 24:02.255
<i>Because they're doing Swan Lake at...</i>

24:02.291 --> 24:04.122
- Not taking him to the ballet.
- Not taking him to the ballet.

24:04.159 --> 24:06.855
Well, what's wrong with the ballet?
Kids love the ballet.

24:06.929 --> 24:09.998
- Justin loves the ballet.
- Look, let me talk to Gio.

24:09.998 --> 24:11.898
No. Why do you need to talk to Gio?

24:11.967 --> 24:14.527
- Give me the phone.
- I'm handling it!

24:15.304 --> 24:17.603
Hey. What about Coney Island?

24:17.707 --> 24:19.675
We'll grab some dogs.
Ride the Cyclone.

24:19.776 --> 24:22.040
Perfect, Gio. I'll meet you there.

24:22.111 --> 24:24.136
Thank you for driving.

24:25.615 --> 24:27.173
You always do this to me.

24:27.250 --> 24:30.151
Right when I think I'm out,
you pull me right back in.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.881
Well, you know what, Gio?

24:31.955 --> 24:35.858
When this is all done, you can get back
into your meaty cheese van

24:35.926 --> 24:39.828
and drive as far away from
Betty Suarez Town as you want.

24:39.897 --> 24:41.387
Suarez Land.

24:47.071 --> 24:50.235
Hello! Come on back.
Through the beads.

24:51.843 --> 24:55.779
Hi. Welcome to Hilda's Beautilities,
what can I do for you?

24:55.880 --> 24:57.848
Perm? Pedicure?

24:57.949 --> 25:01.214
- I'm here about my husband.
- Yeah, yeah, we do men's hair, too.

25:01.253 --> 25:03.882
I followed him here one day.

25:03.923 --> 25:05.823
His name's Tony Diaz.

25:06.392 --> 25:07.484
Tony?

25:09.061 --> 25:11.757
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's going on.

25:12.031 --> 25:15.159
- Listen. I know...
- Please, just talk to your sister,

25:15.268 --> 25:17.794
- tell her to stop seeing him.
- My sister?

25:17.871 --> 25:21.204
He's been meeting her in the city,
in her apartment.

25:22.142 --> 25:25.236
I was just there, thinking
I was going to catch them again,

25:25.345 --> 25:27.506
but she was there
with some French guy.

25:27.614 --> 25:29.639
She must be some insatiable slut.

25:29.750 --> 25:32.514
Hey! This is my sister
we're talking about here.

25:32.586 --> 25:35.988
I'm sorry. I don't even blame her.

25:37.292 --> 25:40.728
It's our own fault, Tony and me.
We married young.

25:40.795 --> 25:43.195
We've been together for a long time.

25:43.264 --> 25:45.994
At some point, things just got cold.

25:47.068 --> 25:52.371
We stopped talking,
spending time together, everything.

25:53.108 --> 25:55.736
But I never stopped loving him, ever.

25:56.545 --> 26:00.345
Even today, when he told me
he was in love with someone else.

26:02.818 --> 26:06.118
- Is that crazy?
- No.

26:07.324 --> 26:09.758
I don't know what I'm going to do.

26:12.095 --> 26:14.461
Please just talk to your sister.

26:14.564 --> 26:17.158
Tell her I want a chance. That's all.

26:17.233 --> 26:20.362
I want to make things better
between him and me.

26:26.344 --> 26:28.869
I want a chance to save my marriage.

26:51.070 --> 26:52.332
You won!

26:53.473 --> 26:55.805
- Pay up.
- Fine.

26:56.709 --> 26:59.837
<i>But I'm gonna kick
your derrière in the ring toss.</i>

27:02.115 --> 27:03.844
Well, you're good with him.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.044
Yeah, well. He's a good kid.

27:07.454 --> 27:09.684
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's DJ?

27:09.757 --> 27:11.691
He went to grab something to eat.
Are you okay?

27:11.759 --> 27:12.726
Look, I don't have much time.

27:12.826 --> 27:14.953
I've got a car waiting
to take DJ and me to the airport.

27:15.028 --> 27:17.553
The Meade family jet
is gonna fly us to...

27:17.631 --> 27:19.189
I haven't figured that part out yet.

27:19.266 --> 27:21.030
Do you guys know, is there a country

27:21.102 --> 27:23.263
that doesn't have
an extradition treaty with the US?

27:23.338 --> 27:25.033
Iceland's a real country, right?

27:25.106 --> 27:26.903
Daniel, what are you talking about?

27:26.975 --> 27:29.773
The judge refused to grant a stay
for the custody order.

27:29.844 --> 27:31.869
DJ's grandparents
are taking him back to France.

27:31.946 --> 27:34.915
What? That's... That's crazy! Why?

27:34.984 --> 27:36.246
- It doesn't matter...
- It doesn't matter?

27:36.352 --> 27:38.820
Daniel, you're his father!
They can't just take your son!

27:38.921 --> 27:40.650
He's not my son! Okay?

27:40.756 --> 27:42.656
DJ is not my son.

27:43.826 --> 27:45.020
Guys.

27:46.629 --> 27:50.361
<i>Hey, DJ. Are you having très fun?</i>

27:53.103 --> 27:58.200
DJ, come on, wait! DJ!
DJ, come on, stop. Come back.

27:58.542 --> 28:01.841
On the upside,
his English is getting really good.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.150
DJ?
Daniel Jr!

28:12.256 --> 28:15.282
DJ?
Daniel Jr!

28:16.694 --> 28:20.494
Daniel, why didn't you tell me?
You tell me everything.

28:20.799 --> 28:24.064
I know, I just... I guess I thought
I could fix it somehow. You know?

28:24.136 --> 28:28.869
Make it go away. I was just afraid
if I said it out loud it would make it real.

28:28.941 --> 28:32.308
Wow.
Do you know who the real father is?

28:32.377 --> 28:33.571
Yeah.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.543
Alexis.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.308
Oh!

28:40.620 --> 28:41.746
Wow.

28:44.624 --> 28:48.583
Look, the important thing is, Alexis
doesn't want to be the father, and I do.

28:48.695 --> 28:50.595
What does that mean?
What are you going to do?

28:50.663 --> 28:52.632
Gonna run away,

28:52.700 --> 28:54.691
someplace his grandparents
can't get to us.

28:54.768 --> 28:56.668
Are they awful people?

28:57.605 --> 28:59.436
No. Not at all.

29:01.275 --> 29:05.905
Okay, so these two nice people
show up

29:05.946 --> 29:08.643
to get their grandson,

29:09.384 --> 29:13.445
and all of a sudden you want
to become an international fugitive?

29:13.922 --> 29:16.413
This is a really bad plan, isn't it?

29:17.826 --> 29:22.196
Well, you know sometimes

29:23.199 --> 29:25.690
when we want something really bad,

29:26.736 --> 29:30.035
we forget that
there are other people involved.

29:30.106 --> 29:32.973
We just get stuck
in our own little worlds,

29:33.042 --> 29:36.011
and it doesn't matter
what other people feel.

29:36.345 --> 29:39.406
Except that it does matter.

29:42.886 --> 29:46.879
Hey, I think I know where he is.
Come on.

29:53.932 --> 29:57.868
You know, I went to a lot of trouble
to get you a perfectly nice cubicle.

29:57.936 --> 30:01.337
You'd really destroy my daughter's life?

30:01.472 --> 30:03.736
All for some power play
over the company?

30:03.775 --> 30:06.471
Alexis tried to destroy my child's life
for the same reason.

30:06.678 --> 30:10.376
- I just want justice served.
- I know what you want,

30:10.449 --> 30:13.475
but Alexis will never give you control
over Meade Publications.

30:13.552 --> 30:14.814
She'll go to prison first.

30:14.887 --> 30:16.184
Well, then,
we have nothing to discuss.

30:16.255 --> 30:18.655
Not necessarily.

30:18.724 --> 30:22.057
I said she'll never give you control
over the company.

30:22.561 --> 30:23.722
Go on.

30:24.130 --> 30:26.621
I'll convince her to split her shares,

30:26.733 --> 30:29.031
sign over half to Daniel, half to you,

30:29.102 --> 30:32.003
well, your unborn child.

30:32.072 --> 30:35.166
You'll each have
a 50% stake in Meade.

30:35.241 --> 30:37.266
Equal partners
in running the company,

30:37.344 --> 30:39.870
equal partners
in running the magazine.

30:39.947 --> 30:42.882
You'll both be Editors-in-Chief.

30:42.950 --> 30:48.183
And in exchange,
you will use your influence with the DA

30:48.789 --> 30:50.416
to get the charges dropped.

30:50.491 --> 30:52.618
Well, I don't think
Daniel will be happy with you

30:52.693 --> 30:56.687
bartering away his legacy
to spring his jailbird sister.

30:59.334 --> 31:01.734
You may not understand this,
Wilhelmina,

31:01.837 --> 31:04.271
but there's something called sacrifice.

31:04.339 --> 31:06.807
Daniel and Alexis
have had their differences,

31:06.875 --> 31:10.642
but at the end of the day
they're still brother and sister,

31:12.048 --> 31:15.313
and that's all that really matters.

31:33.704 --> 31:35.035
Are you sure he's down here?

31:35.105 --> 31:37.972
Why don't we just check the Cyclone
one more time?

31:38.042 --> 31:40.841
- Or Dante's Inferno?
- No, trust me,

31:40.912 --> 31:43.506
he doesn't want to be around
a bunch of screaming tourists.

31:44.649 --> 31:48.517
What he really needs is a place
to be alone with his thoughts

31:48.586 --> 31:52.044
and maybe get a good shot
up some chick's skirt, too.

31:52.924 --> 31:55.155
<i>And voilà.</i>

31:58.631 --> 32:02.362
DJ. Hey. Are you okay?

32:04.837 --> 32:06.930
You really had me worried.

32:14.414 --> 32:18.510
Look, I'm so sorry
you had to find out like this,

32:20.220 --> 32:24.418
but it doesn't change the way
I feel about you, not a bit.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.528
Even after I found out,

32:28.162 --> 32:30.528
I still wanted you to be my son.

32:33.735 --> 32:35.862
I wanted to fight for you.

32:35.970 --> 32:38.530
Why don't you? Fight?

32:41.610 --> 32:43.305
It's complicated.

32:45.614 --> 32:48.242
Your grandparents
miss you very much,

32:50.085 --> 32:52.053
and I know you miss them

32:53.388 --> 32:54.878
and your mom.

32:57.927 --> 32:59.326
Don't you?

33:01.765 --> 33:04.461
Look, I just... I think it's time

33:06.236 --> 33:08.636
for you to go home for a while.

33:08.738 --> 33:11.435
<i>But I want you to be my father,
mon papa!</i>

33:11.542 --> 33:14.602
I want that
maybe more than anything, but,

33:17.915 --> 33:19.348
DJ, I'm not.

33:25.957 --> 33:29.757
Maybe I can be your really cool

33:30.328 --> 33:31.920
American uncle.

33:36.668 --> 33:40.765
I'm not going away, ever.

34:07.868 --> 34:10.803
Wow. You look great.

34:11.672 --> 34:12.867
Thanks.

34:13.574 --> 34:17.875
Well, I thought we could
go out for dessert, take a walk,

34:17.978 --> 34:22.473
or we could do
whatever you want to do,

34:22.917 --> 34:25.886
because I don't have to be home
anytime soon.

34:26.589 --> 34:28.079
I can't, Tony.

34:29.158 --> 34:30.625
What's wrong?

34:33.596 --> 34:35.120
You're married.

34:36.998 --> 34:39.831
Well, I told her today, everything.

34:39.902 --> 34:43.634
So, you and I, we could be together.
It's okay.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.675
We don't have to worry.

34:47.878 --> 34:48.902
No.

34:49.411 --> 34:53.143
Hilda. It's over.
It was over before I met you.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.618
- Does she feel that way?
- I feel that way.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.815
- I'm meant to be with you.
- Okay, wait, no, stop.

35:00.725 --> 35:01.919
Please.

35:04.996 --> 35:06.930
Jill came to the salon today.

35:06.998 --> 35:08.795
- She's still in love with you.
- What?

35:08.866 --> 35:10.561
I can't be the reason
you guys break up.

35:10.635 --> 35:12.193
What are you talking about?
This is crazy.

35:12.271 --> 35:14.739
- Tony...
- Hilda, don't I have a say in this?

35:14.806 --> 35:17.434
I love you. You understand that?

35:21.046 --> 35:23.139
I love you, too,

35:23.248 --> 35:25.978
but I lost somebody that I loved before.

35:28.187 --> 35:32.556
We never got a second chance.
I don't wish that on anybody.

35:33.860 --> 35:35.953
Whatever happens with you
and your wife,

35:36.029 --> 35:38.554
I can't be responsible for it.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.290
I'm so sorry.

36:31.788 --> 36:33.483
Here's your cheese.

36:37.527 --> 36:39.461
- Heaven from a cow.
- Mmm.

36:39.963 --> 36:43.592
- Thank you.
- You earned it. And, Gio...

36:46.671 --> 36:48.366
So, you were right.

36:50.742 --> 36:54.007
I guess sometimes
I do live in Betty Suarez Land,

36:54.946 --> 36:59.008
but only because I really thought
that we could be friends again.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.278
I know.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.545
That's how you roll
in Teddy Bear Lane.

37:05.190 --> 37:09.388
I thought I was doing some big selfless
thing, and it was all about me.

37:10.562 --> 37:14.123
I guess I just have to let you feel
what you need to feel.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.600
But whatever it's worth, I...

37:17.003 --> 37:19.471
I really am sorry that I hurt you.

37:21.775 --> 37:25.506
I was thinking,
I spent the whole day with you,

37:26.846 --> 37:30.715
breathing the same air and everything,
and it wasn't so bad.

37:30.785 --> 37:33.481
- Gio...
- I guess it was stupid,

37:33.554 --> 37:36.785
- banning you from my life.
- No, it's not stupid,

37:37.458 --> 37:39.551
not if that's what you feel.

37:43.464 --> 37:47.162
You know, I've known you for a while,

37:48.603 --> 37:52.801
<i>and I've seen you at work,
swimming with those sharks at Mode,</i>

37:53.542 --> 37:56.033
keeping Daniel's head above water.

37:57.512 --> 38:00.505
You're gonna do great things one day,
Suarez.

38:02.118 --> 38:04.848
I don't blame you for choosing yourself.

38:26.677 --> 38:28.440
Willie, don't feel bad.

38:28.512 --> 38:30.981
Bad? Why should I feel bad?

38:31.349 --> 38:34.045
Well, you lost Alexis' portion of Meade.

38:34.119 --> 38:36.849
<i>And now you have to share Mode
with Daniel. I'm distraught.</i>

38:36.921 --> 38:40.687
Marc, my adorable
but short-sighted minion,

38:41.259 --> 38:45.355
six months ago I was nothing more
than a salaried employee for Meade.

38:45.463 --> 38:50.231
Now I control 50%
of a publishing empire.

38:52.505 --> 38:54.496
Only 50% to go.

38:55.975 --> 38:59.342
Did I say distraught? I meant hot.

39:16.531 --> 39:19.364
Wow, you look pretty good.
No jailhouse tattoos.

39:19.433 --> 39:22.664
You haven't lived until
you've been thoroughly de-loused.

39:22.737 --> 39:24.364
Tell me about it.

39:25.940 --> 39:28.534
So are you sure you don't want
to stick around for a while?

39:28.609 --> 39:32.137
No, I don't trust Wilhelmina not to sic
the DA on me again.

39:32.214 --> 39:36.116
Besides, I could use a break.
Provence is beautiful this time of year.

39:36.185 --> 39:38.346
My flight leaves in an hour.

39:38.820 --> 39:41.948
So, while you're in France,
maybe you can

39:42.024 --> 39:44.584
spend some time getting to know DJ.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.926
You're okay with that?

39:47.263 --> 39:48.753
He's your son.

39:52.535 --> 39:54.628
I'm sorry I slept with your girlfriend.

39:55.972 --> 39:58.338
I'm sorry for trying to punch you.

39:58.408 --> 40:00.774
I'm sorry you suck at fighting.

40:05.082 --> 40:06.481
Thanks, Mom.

40:07.151 --> 40:08.413
For what?

40:09.553 --> 40:11.544
For always being there.

40:12.556 --> 40:16.151
For never judging me. I love you.

40:16.994 --> 40:18.587
I lost you once.

40:19.297 --> 40:21.231
I don't want to lose you again.

40:21.299 --> 40:23.790
You won't. I'll be back.

40:24.669 --> 40:26.102
I promise.

40:27.472 --> 40:29.963
<i>Just because I'm hurting</i>

40:31.276 --> 40:34.872
<i>Doesn't mean I'm hurt</i>

40:36.749 --> 40:42.187
<i>Doesn't mean I didn't get
What I deserved</i>

40:42.255 --> 40:45.053
<i>No better and no worse</i>

40:47.761 --> 40:50.696
<i>I just got lost</i>

40:52.966 --> 40:57.266
<i>Every river that I tried to cross</i>

40:59.906 --> 41:03.900
