down in the bar,

I've noticed guests

09:55.999 --> 09:58.999
on their preference sheets
that they never ask for.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
So if something's difficult

Yes, hello, I was wondering

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
It's kind of an emergency.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999

to angle past that sign
a little bit

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
before I kick it over,
because once we get broadside,

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
we get a 25- or 30-knot gust--

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999

10:53.999 --> 10:55.999
we have a rock jetty,

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
and if the wind's
blowing the wrong direction,

10:57.999 --> 11:00.999
it'll carry us onto that jetty
if we don't clear in time.

up there?

42:16.999 --> 42:17.999
He had his chance.

42:17.999 --> 42:20.999
He could've stolen third,
but he missed it.

42:20.999 --> 42:23.999
Hey, buddy, I care about you.
I love you.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.999
- f*** you.
- No, I'm just being honest.

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
- At times, she does want me,
and then at times, she doesn't.

42:28.999 --> 42:31.999
She's definitely leading me on.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
- Next time on "Below Deck"...

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
- Rumor has it
I'm not a charter chef.

42:38.999 --> 42:41.999
That's what you said to
my little South African friend.

42:41.999 --> 42:42.999
I think you should just worry
about talking to your guests,

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
or I'll step in
and start talking to them.

42:44.999 --> 42:47.999
- Oh, my God.
- Connie?

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
[laughter]

42:49.999 --> 42:51.999
- I got my whipped-cream bikini.
I got my buzz on.

42:51.999 --> 42:53.999
I think it's a good night
for Connie.

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
- What the f***
happened back here?

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
We need to tighten things up,

42:56.999 --> 42:58.999
and we need to start working
together as a better team,

42:58.999 --> 43:01.999
because I'm not gonna
get f***ing fired.

43:01.999 --> 43:02.999
Heads are gonna get
in the f***ing game,

43:02.999 --> 43:04.000
or people are going home.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.999
So you can start working
or pack.

43:05.999 --> 43:06.999
I don't give a f***.

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
- It f***ing stops here and now.

43:09.999 --> 43:13.999
Pack your sh**.
We're done.

43:13.999 --> 43:16.999
