15:49.130 --> 15:51.570
Yes. Perhaps I should.

15:54.490 --> 15:56.180
Very well.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.600
I'll bring your...

15:58.800 --> 16:00.860
offer to my ambassador.

16:01.060 --> 16:05.840
Don't let me down,
Mr. Millworthy.

16:12.150 --> 16:14.950
They won't investigate.

16:15.150 --> 16:16.790
But I will.

16:16.990 --> 16:20.000
You know, I've always respected
the Black Raven.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.290
Yeah, they're flashy fuckers,
but efficient.

16:22.490 --> 16:23.710
And they knew how to keep
to their patch.

16:23.910 --> 16:25.260
Glad they got
a decent send-off.

16:25.460 --> 16:26.760
Good.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.760
Then you won't mind
helping me out.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.490
No. No more favors.
I don't work with police.

16:32.530 --> 16:34.930
I'm not police.
Not anymore.

16:35.130 --> 16:36.640
But you're asking me
to get a message to a copper.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.650
Constable Berwick, yeah.
He's one of the good ones.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.190
And you wonder
why everyone in here hates you.

16:42.390 --> 16:43.610
Listen, mate.
You know what I do?

16:43.810 --> 16:45.110
I run a gang.
Dress it up how you like,

16:45.310 --> 16:46.780
but that's what
it comes down to.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.610
The Black Raven...
they're a gang.

16:48.810 --> 16:49.740
I respect that.

16:49.940 --> 16:51.320
But coppers...

16:51.520 --> 16:52.660

Just bigger and meaner.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.620

You go around
pretending you're not.

16:59.820 --> 17:01.540
Your head's
still in the gang,

17:01.740 --> 17:04.770
but the rest of you's stuck
in here with the rest of us.

17:05.770 --> 17:07.460
This is not about me.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.220
Do you not give a fuck
what happens to the Row?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.640
I'm a businessman,
Mr. Philostrate,

17:12.840 --> 17:14.260
and what the Black Raven
just did

17:14.460 --> 17:16.010
was very, very bad
for business.

17:16.210 --> 17:18.310
Good luck to them.
But she got what was coming.

17:18.510 --> 17:20.310
Nobody deserves
to die like that.

17:20.510 --> 17:21.650
They knew the risks.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.400
Pulling that stunt
in front of the chancellor.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.690
Made him look weak.
He can't let that go.

17:25.890 --> 17:27.980
They were asking for help.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.900
Then they're idiots.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.530
The only help any of us lot are
ever gonna get from the Burgue

17:32.730 --> 17:34.780
is more boots up our arses.
Which reminds me,

17:34.980 --> 17:37.410
you can take your Marrok friend
with you when you go.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.620
We had a deal.
Darius stays here.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.460
Yeah, well, that was before
your missus and her mates

17:41.660 --> 17:42.620
made all that trouble.

17:42.820 --> 17:43.750
Take it up with her,
if you like.

17:43.950 --> 17:45.170
But you get
your pal out of here.

17:45.370 --> 17:46.460
Where is he supposed to go?

17:46.660 --> 17:48.610
Not my puppy,
not my problem.

17:57.070 --> 17:59.930
You want him off your hands,

18:00.130 --> 18:01.940
you deliver my message.

18:02.130 --> 18:05.690
Or I could toss him in the alley
with the rest of the strays!

18:05.890 --> 18:10.280
You really want a Marrok for
an enemy at a time like this?

18:10.480 --> 18:13.860
I thought
you were a businessman.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.090
All right!
What's the message?

18:19.340 --> 18:20.950
<i>[Darius] Where we going?</i>

18:21.150 --> 18:23.370
The only place I can be sure
no one'll bother you.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.670
[Darius] Not your place, then.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.500
We don't need a guard dog
right now, thanks.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.340

18:37.800 --> 18:39.010

It's this place.
The Row.

18:41.050 --> 18:43.940
There's no peace here
for people like us.

you'd be the one to cheer me up.

Yeah, well, prison and war have
set me straight on a few things.

Did she?
Well, good on her.

19:26.390 --> 19:28.520
She knows what she's about,
your missus.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.400
Does she?

19:30.600 --> 19:31.690
She's thinks I'm still police.

Oh, I wonder where
she got that idea from.

40:37.160 --> 40:40.380
is that Mr. Astrayon and
Miss Imogen were aboard the <i>Swan</i>

40:40.580 --> 40:42.590
when it was captured
off the coast of Ragusa.

40:42.790 --> 40:43.590
It was captured?

40:43.790 --> 40:45.010
It was a Pactist rebel group

40:45.210 --> 40:46.760
called "the New Dawn."

40:46.960 --> 40:49.180
So, Imogen is in...
She's in danger?

40:49.380 --> 40:51.430
I couldn't say, sir,

40:51.630 --> 40:53.760
but I know with the civil war
going on down there,

40:53.960 --> 40:56.480
I don't think
you could get a letter to her.

40:56.670 --> 40:59.100
Right.

40:59.300 --> 41:01.360
And that is Ragusa,
you're quite sure?

41:01.550 --> 41:04.190
I heard it directly from
a member of the <i>Swan's</i> crew,

41:04.390 --> 41:05.900
who was released unharmed.

41:06.100 --> 41:09.070
Fergus, um,
you are a loyal man,

41:09.270 --> 41:11.620
and I do not wish
to patronize your position,

41:11.810 --> 41:14.330
but it is the least
I can do.

41:14.530 --> 41:15.620
Please.

41:15.820 --> 41:17.050
Accepted.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.830
[groaning]

41:20.030 --> 41:22.560
You Critch-loving servant!

41:24.390 --> 41:26.420
- [groans]
- [coins scatter]

41:26.620 --> 41:29.050
[retches]

41:29.250 --> 41:31.970
[groans softly]

41:32.170 --> 41:34.700
[panting]

41:48.170 --> 41:50.170
[panting heavily]

41:52.880 --> 41:54.880
[indistinct chatter]

42:15.110 --> 42:16.820
[wings fluttering]

42:20.620 --> 42:22.940
I know Vignette didn't tell you
about this place.

42:23.140 --> 42:24.860
Is she here?

42:25.050 --> 42:27.230
She might be.

42:27.430 --> 42:29.210
You shouldn't be.

42:31.920 --> 42:35.490
I heard someone call you
"Kaine," is that right?

42:35.690 --> 42:38.510
Oona was brave.

42:40.050 --> 42:42.210
I was there when she died.

42:42.410 --> 42:45.920
She must have known it was her
last chance to do something.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.600
For all the fae on the Row.

42:50.900 --> 42:52.380
Vignette's got to hear
what I've got to say,

42:52.580 --> 42:55.400
so I am going inside.
But I'm asking nicely.

42:56.990 --> 42:59.450
Step aside, please.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.800
[quiet chatter]

43:26.560 --> 43:28.440
Vignette?

43:31.770 --> 43:33.340
- How did you find us?
- It wasn't a human

43:33.540 --> 43:36.180
who killed your fellow Raven.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.720
- You saying it was one of us?
- I found where it happened.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.350
Well, Tourmaline did.

43:40.550 --> 43:42.850
High up on the steeple
of Saint Van Arragorn's.

43:43.050 --> 43:44.230
No human could've got there.

43:44.430 --> 43:45.810
- Tourmaline found them?
- [Philo] Just listen.

43:46.010 --> 43:47.810
It's hard to understand,

43:48.010 --> 43:49.860
but she's been having visions.

43:50.060 --> 43:51.940
True visions.

43:52.140 --> 43:55.780
Something to do with
the old Haruspex. The witch.

43:55.980 --> 43:57.660
Led her right to the bodies.

43:57.860 --> 43:59.450
Ask her yourself
if you don't believe me.

43:59.650 --> 44:03.160
The point is,
the killer was not human.

44:03.360 --> 44:06.330
Well, it was a human
who shot Oona.

44:06.530 --> 44:09.040
Sergeant Dombey, correct?

44:09.240 --> 44:11.420
No.

44:11.620 --> 44:13.510
No, you can't go after a copper.

44:13.700 --> 44:15.420
You've no idea
the world of shit

44:15.620 --> 44:17.180
that will bring down
on the Row.

44:17.380 --> 44:19.140
A worse world than this?

44:19.340 --> 44:20.930
What more can they do to us?

44:21.130 --> 44:23.180
Talk to them.

44:23.380 --> 44:25.600
This makes no sense.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.230
Why should I?

44:27.430 --> 44:29.400
They're right.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.730
But you don't know
the police like I do.

44:31.930 --> 44:33.230
If you go after one of them,

44:33.430 --> 44:35.820
the whole Row will burn.

44:36.020 --> 44:38.710
They'll come for all of us.

44:40.550 --> 44:42.950
They'll never let you pass
for one of them again.

44:43.150 --> 44:44.660
You know that, right?

44:44.860 --> 44:46.910
- This isn't about me.
- Hmm.

44:47.110 --> 44:49.290
I think it is.

44:49.490 --> 44:51.590
I think it's about us.

44:51.780 --> 44:54.710
About me standing here
with my people.

44:54.910 --> 44:57.630
And you standing there
with a choice.

44:57.830 --> 45:00.900
Are you with us,
or are you with them?
