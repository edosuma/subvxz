00:17.885 --> 00:21.021
*

00:31.532 --> 00:32.933
(Southern accent):
Mm...

00:32.966 --> 00:35.536
Love don't see
color, Mama.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.777
CARYN:
Oh...

00:43.811 --> 00:45.246
I just love the way

00:45.279 --> 00:47.548
the sweat glistens off
your back in the sun.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.921
(Caryn giggling)

00:56.657 --> 00:57.525
(crinkles)

00:57.558 --> 00:59.560
(gasps)
Oh...

00:59.593 --> 01:02.730
Where'd you hide
the afikoman?

01:04.765 --> 01:05.766
(door bangs)
(screams)

01:05.799 --> 01:06.967
Gah!
Who's there?!

01:07.000 --> 01:07.701
Me.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.303
Oh.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.639
My therapist told me
to keep a dream journal,

01:11.672 --> 01:13.541
so I just...
I got to write this down

01:13.574 --> 01:14.775
before I forget.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.945
Um, cotton plantation,
Idris Elba,

01:17.978 --> 01:20.381
Passover Seder...

01:20.414 --> 01:22.216
Oh!
Back from the market.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.951
Dinner is at 8:00 p.m. sharp.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.753
Dress is
business casual.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.054
Again?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.257
Ow! Lucky us.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.125
I'm gonna need you
to stay out of your kitchen

01:31.159 --> 01:33.194
for the next 45 minutes.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.932
STOSH:
I just stayed naked

01:38.966 --> 01:40.468
the whole day.
(laughter)

01:40.501 --> 01:41.735
Oh, my God, Stosh,

01:41.769 --> 01:43.237
dinner is amazing.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.439
I could not love
this pasta more.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.941
And the cheese. How do you know
all my favorite foods?

01:47.975 --> 01:49.810
I listen and I care.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.145
You know,
he's only

01:51.179 --> 01:52.446
been living with me
for a month--

01:52.480 --> 01:53.947
already knows everything I like.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.250
Just the other day, I said,
"I like oatmeal."

01:56.284 --> 01:57.618
And he said, "Yeah, I know."

01:57.651 --> 01:59.287
Actually, you screamed it out.
(chuckles)

01:59.320 --> 02:00.921
Then you threw
that thing.
Yeah.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.523
So, what's the occasion?

02:02.556 --> 02:05.092
Mm! He had a big job
interview today, right?

02:05.125 --> 02:05.993
How'd that go?

02:06.026 --> 02:07.761
Let's just say

02:07.795 --> 02:09.363
by this time next week,
anybody in the tri-state area

02:09.397 --> 02:10.964
looking to score some

02:10.998 --> 02:12.766
calcium fluoroaluminosilicate
dental cement

02:12.800 --> 02:14.468
is gonna have to go
through this guy.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.136
That is so badass.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.805
(phone vibrating)
STOSH: Oh!

02:17.838 --> 02:19.440
That's my headhunter now.
Got to take this.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.375
You guys eat up.
There's plenty.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.711
I really cleaned
out the place.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.447
Jerry!

02:26.480 --> 02:27.948
(whispering):
Tell me you got some good news.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.883
What?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.151
They're passing?

02:31.185 --> 02:33.654
Did you get it?

02:33.687 --> 02:36.156
Jerry, I am completely broke.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.292
I've been shacking up
with my cousin in Queens,

02:38.326 --> 02:39.960
I'm mooching food
off my neighbors,

02:39.993 --> 02:42.330
and I haven't had my teeth
cleaned professionally

02:42.363 --> 02:43.897
in over a month.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.033
Plus, I owe $1,000

02:46.066 --> 02:49.737
to a very scary man
named Tulip.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.505
Like the flower, yes.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.874
Did you get it?
Hey, did you get it?
Looking like it, buddy.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.377
Across the room
exploding fist bump!

02:56.410 --> 02:58.346
(makes explosion noise)

02:58.379 --> 03:00.248
No, trust me,
he is very scary.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.849
It's his given name.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.217
He could be Dutch.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.354
Yes, "Dutch" would be
a much scarier nickname.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.521
Who gives a crap?!

03:07.555 --> 03:08.989
Jerry, you find me a job.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.424
I am drowning.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.760
Jerry, no, come on,
I love the salary,

03:12.793 --> 03:14.728
but these benefits
are crap.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.697
Now, you call me back
when you have something
better, you got it?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.599
Oh...

03:18.632 --> 03:20.601
Way to stick it to 'em.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.270
Hey, what's for dessert?

03:22.303 --> 03:24.772
You know, all week I have
been craving something with...

03:24.805 --> 03:25.973
Coconut. Right.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.643
Whoa. Psychic.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.248
(sportscast playing over TV)

03:39.653 --> 03:41.922
Oh, boom! You remember
flipping baseball cards

03:41.955 --> 03:43.557
like this when we were kids?

03:43.591 --> 03:46.126
Uh, you used to call the game
"Winner Takes the Cards."

03:46.159 --> 03:49.162
I always won,
but you always took the cards.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.433
You totally misnamed that game.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.901
(chuckles)

03:55.135 --> 03:57.805
Hey, Cousin Stosh...

03:57.838 --> 04:00.308
I-I've been thinking
a lot about something,

04:00.341 --> 04:01.942
and it's kind of hard

04:01.975 --> 04:03.411
for me to say.
Uh-huh.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.913
I think it's time you moved back

04:05.946 --> 04:07.214
to your condo in the city.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.449
Okay.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.084
Wait. What?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.820
Well, I mean...

04:12.853 --> 04:14.455
when Dad died and you offered

04:14.488 --> 04:17.391
to come stay here with me,
that... that was amazing.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.059
But I can't help

04:19.092 --> 04:21.662
but feel selfish for keeping you
from enjoying your life.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.097
What, are you kidding me?

04:24.131 --> 04:25.833
Come on. I'm enjoying my life.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.635
I mean, look at this.
I love this game.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.503
Oh, my gosh, when you
get it in, what a rush.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.004
Come on.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.673
I mean, you wouldn't
rather be out somewhere

04:32.706 --> 04:34.408
with a couple stewardesses,

04:34.442 --> 04:36.810
maybe hanging out
at a fancy discotheque?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.346
Tell me I'm wrong.
You're wrong.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.013
Mainly about
what century we're in,

04:40.047 --> 04:41.849
but most of
the other stuff, too.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.283
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.286
I mean, you came
to help me heal, and I have.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.022
Eric, I hate to break it to you,
but you're not healed.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.491
Uh, I feel like I'm healed.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.759
Of course you do!

04:51.792 --> 04:53.327
Feeling like you're healed

04:53.361 --> 04:55.028
is the classic sign
that you're not really healed.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.530
Really?

04:56.564 --> 04:58.265
Let's face facts here, Eric.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.534
You took care of your parents
for so long,

05:00.568 --> 05:01.935
you've got no life
of your own.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.537
Well, I mean, I have a life.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.305
You got any friends?
Yes.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.140
You got any friends
that aren't puppets?

05:10.978 --> 05:14.348
Yes! All the guys that work the
night shift down at the bridge.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.649
They get together
once a week

05:15.683 --> 05:17.050
to watch a Mets game
at somebody's house.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.719
I hear it is so much fun.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.354
Wait a minute. You telling me
you don't even go?

05:20.388 --> 05:23.457
Well, I...
it's invitation only, so...

05:23.491 --> 05:25.393
I got a feeling
this might be my year.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.395
This is gonna be your year,
all right?

05:27.428 --> 05:28.629
Because I'm here.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.197
I'm here to help.
You see?

05:31.264 --> 05:32.800
You see how this works?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.635
You know, the guy can
be an arrogant jerk,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.203
but he really
can cook a meal.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.405
I know.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.739
I don't usually eat
that kind of cheese,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.040
but it was delicious.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.410
Um, Zara, you do eat
that kind of cheese.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.211
Every time I buy it,
it disappears.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.213
My therapist told me
that I have to stop

05:46.246 --> 05:47.848
letting people
take advantage of me.

05:47.881 --> 05:48.982
Mm-hmm.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.018
And how much
does she charge you?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.920
$425 an hour.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.655
But Hilary Duff
goes to her, too.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.390
Well, both you and Hilary Duff
are getting reamed,

05:56.424 --> 05:58.392
because I do not eat
that kind of cheese.
Zara,

05:58.426 --> 05:59.760
you eat my cheese.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.094
And my other food, too.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.163
Luckily, every time you do,
Stosh shows up

06:03.196 --> 06:04.398
with the exact
same stuff.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.434
(gasps)
(laughing)

06:06.467 --> 06:07.701
Son of a bitch.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.102
He stole my food.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.273
Coconut.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.609
Here's the ticket.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.078
The Matushi
65-inch curved

06:18.111 --> 06:20.948
ultra-high-def
3D smart TV.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.850
You throw this piece of crap
in the Dumpster,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.952
you invite your coworkers
over for a Mets game,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.187
and bam!
Instant friends

06:27.220 --> 06:28.889
whose eyes are not
made of buttons.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.525
$2,500 though?
I mean, yikes.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.026
Well, what about the money
your pops left you?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.294
Don't you think
he'd want you

06:34.327 --> 06:35.896
to spend it on
something like this?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.898
(phone chimes)
I mean, all he said
in the will

06:37.931 --> 06:40.634
is that I shouldn't
spend it "like a moron."

06:43.471 --> 06:44.938
Okay.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.740
Here's how we're gonna do this.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.576
You give me the $2,500.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.110
I'll go buy the TV tomorrow,

06:50.143 --> 06:52.245
get it all set up for
you while you're out.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.881
You in?

06:53.914 --> 06:56.416
I'm in.
Yeah?

06:56.450 --> 06:57.885
Yeah! Thanks,
Cousin Stosh!
All right.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.219
Hey, no problem.
(laughing)

06:59.252 --> 07:01.221
Now, you go get that money.
Okay.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.990
Hundreds.
Oh.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.561
All right, so just to be
clear, you're telling me

07:07.595 --> 07:08.996
no one's gonna
notice the difference

07:09.029 --> 07:10.330
between this TV and
the Matushi, right?

07:10.363 --> 07:12.800
What's to know? Same guts.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.902
With Matushi,
all you're paying for is name.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.170
It's for my cousin. I just want
to make sure it's a good TV.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.672
Not good, my friend, great.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.508
Same guts.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.009
I tell you,
you're going to call me and say,

07:22.042 --> 07:23.477
"Shmoolie, sell me another!"
and I say, "No!

07:23.511 --> 07:25.579
At this price, I lose money!"

07:25.613 --> 07:28.549
Really? That sounds like
a terrible business model.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.785
It is. It's cuckoo.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.156
ERIC:
Hey, Kent!

07:36.189 --> 07:39.026
Kent! Everyone's invited
to watch the Mets game

07:39.059 --> 07:41.595
at my house tomorrow
before work, all right?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.796
Your house?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.297
Why would we come
over to your house?

07:44.331 --> 07:45.799
Oh, I don't know.

07:45.833 --> 07:49.269
Maybe because I got a
brand-new 65-inch curved TV.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.437
Oh, really?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.607
Lewandoski's got
a curved TV!

07:53.641 --> 07:55.843
Lewandoski got a third TV?

07:55.876 --> 07:57.845
No, a curved TV!

07:57.878 --> 07:59.713
Lewandoski's cured VD!

07:59.747 --> 08:01.682
Lewandoski's got
a bird with fleas?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.383
He's got a pervy niece!

08:03.416 --> 08:05.318
Is that who watch the third TV?

08:05.352 --> 08:06.687
Curved! It's curvy!

08:06.720 --> 08:07.955
Lewandoski's got scurvy?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.457
He does? Oh, poor guy!

08:10.490 --> 08:12.660
He just got that curved TV.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.129
So you guys coming?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.398
Come on in,
everybody.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.133
Uh, make yourselves
at home.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.169
Uh, enjoy some snacks
and refreshments in the back

08:22.202 --> 08:25.138
and my brand-new
Matushi curved TV.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.507
All right.
Now that's the way I like it.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.010
Long and curved.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.246
Thanks, Miranda.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.249
I misjudged you, Lewandoski.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.485
You're really
showing me something.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.254
This TV says a lot
about who you really are.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.323
Thanks, Kent.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.659
I got my eye on you!

08:45.693 --> 08:48.228
I got my eye on this guy, huh?

08:50.564 --> 08:51.665
For the scurvy.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.100
Oh...

08:56.103 --> 08:57.537
(gasps)

09:00.073 --> 09:01.842
Finally!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.911
I texted you "911,"
like, 911 times.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.078
I'm sorry.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.079
I thought you were my mom.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.547
She texts me "911"

09:07.581 --> 09:09.182
every time one of her friends
from temple

09:09.216 --> 09:10.417
mentions she has a single son.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.019
What's up?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.787
I did a little checking
on our friend Stosh--

09:13.821 --> 09:15.055
if that is his real name.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.456
Oh, my God. It's not?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.626
It is. I was doing that
more for effect.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.094
So what did you find out?
Tell me!

09:21.128 --> 09:22.963
He doesn't own
any condo in the city.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.365
That thing went bye-bye
the moment he lost his job.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.700
He's broke,

09:26.734 --> 09:28.135
and from what I'm seeing,

09:28.168 --> 09:29.436
pretty much blackballed

09:29.469 --> 09:31.404
from the entire
dental sales business.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.573
This is a lot
of information.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.775
What site is this?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.476
ZARA:
"AmIDatingaDouchebag.com."

09:36.509 --> 09:38.411
By the way,
I know you date a lot,

09:38.445 --> 09:40.147
so I signed you up
for a full year.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.481
Thought it might
come in handy.

09:41.514 --> 09:42.750
Yeah, my therapist
suggested

09:42.783 --> 09:43.917
that site, too.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.118
So he's been lying?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.788
About everything?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.623
And poor Eric
has no idea.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.891
Mm-mm.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.726
Ready to send it over to you

09:52.760 --> 09:55.395
at Citi Field in New York City
for the first pitch,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.164
as the 35 and 61 Mets...

09:57.197 --> 09:58.832
Mets.
Come on, Mets.

09:58.866 --> 10:01.168
...square off against
the 41 and 56 Phillies.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.435
Buckle up, baseball fans...

10:02.469 --> 10:03.737
Whoa!

10:03.771 --> 10:04.838
(all exclaiming)
Turn it on!

10:04.872 --> 10:06.606
New TV broken!
No, no.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.009
It's just a-a little
technical difficulty.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.110
(all groaning)

10:10.143 --> 10:12.746
(Eric screaming)

10:12.780 --> 10:14.114
Fire! Save yourselves!

10:14.147 --> 10:16.283
VIJAY:
Here, Jimmy, use your cane!

10:16.316 --> 10:17.450
JIMMY:
You've got my cane!

10:17.484 --> 10:19.319
(panicked shouting)

10:19.352 --> 10:21.855
ERIC:
Stay calm! Stay calm!
My eyes aren't working!

10:21.889 --> 10:24.758
Be calm!
MIRANDA:
Somebody's grabbing my ass.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.927
JIMMY:
Mine, too!
WOMAN:
Somebody grabbed my ass!

10:26.960 --> 10:29.196
There we go. There we go.
We're good, we're good.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.630
Wait a second.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.466
This isn't a Matushi;
this is a Mabushi.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.102
It looks like a Matushi,

10:35.135 --> 10:37.004
but has completely
different guts.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.173
A Mabushi? I don't...
I don't understand.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.508
Well, let me explain.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.711
Because of your cheapness,

10:43.744 --> 10:46.213
we won't be able
to watch the Mets game

10:46.246 --> 10:48.181
for the first time ever!

10:49.349 --> 10:50.617
Shame on you!

10:50.650 --> 10:52.519
Shame... on... you!

10:52.552 --> 10:54.688
Let's get out of here!

10:54.722 --> 10:56.957
No, no! Guys!
Come on, don't go.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.326
Hey, I have a solar-powered
radio upstairs.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.328
Sounds amazing
when it's not cloudy.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.830
Miranda? Please stay.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.698
I loved you.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.569
Well, that was
a huge overreaction!

11:09.602 --> 11:13.240
The Mets were mathematically
eliminated in June!

11:13.273 --> 11:15.275
By the way.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.211
This sucks.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.519
What's going on?

11:26.553 --> 11:28.889
And why do I smell...
(sniffs)

11:28.922 --> 11:30.490
burning TV set?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.193
Hmm, smells more like
lying douche bag to me.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.863
Okay, clearly there have been

11:35.896 --> 11:38.165
some developments since I left.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.833
That crappy TV
you bought Eric blew up

11:39.867 --> 11:41.334
in front of all of his friends.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.836
He was so humiliated.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.371
I wanted to cry.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.006
So I did.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.841
Damn. Where is he?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.077
Upstairs. And he doesn't
want to see you.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.880
Yeah, I'll make it right.
He doesn't want to see you.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.448
Okay. Okay!

11:56.383 --> 11:58.551
(groans)

11:58.585 --> 12:00.754
Ow!

12:01.621 --> 12:02.923
ERIC:
Who is it?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.224
Stosh.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.126
Go away.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.895
Who is it?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.230
Still Stosh.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.499
Go away.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.735
Can we talk?

12:15.769 --> 12:16.636
No.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.771
Come on, turn around.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.306
You're creeping me out.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.708
Promised myself I'd never
lay eyes on you again.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.376
Look, I needed to save
a couple bucks

12:23.410 --> 12:25.779
on the TV to get myself
out of a tough situation.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.414
My kidneys were in jeopardy.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.615
Come on,

12:28.648 --> 12:29.783
I was gonna pay you back!

12:29.817 --> 12:31.284
It's not about the TV.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.719
Then what is it?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.923
Why'd you come
to my father's funeral that day?

12:35.956 --> 12:38.591
Why'd you offer to come here
and stay with me?

12:38.625 --> 12:39.893
And please, don't lie.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.128
'Cause if you lie,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.596
my father will turn over
in his grave.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.632
Look, I told you...

12:45.665 --> 12:47.067
it was to help you out.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.568
That's a lie!

12:48.601 --> 12:49.903
You're a liar!

12:49.937 --> 12:52.105
You lost your job
and your condo

12:52.139 --> 12:54.574
the day before, and you just
needed a free place to stay.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.176
All right, who told you that?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.410
I'm not an idiot, Cousin Stosh.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.146
I can figure things out
for myself.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.747
I mean, maybe not
this particular thing.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.815
Zara told me.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.416
But when she did,

13:03.450 --> 13:06.586
I promised myself I would
never lay eyes on you again.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.188
Damn it.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.990
And you know what? Now my...
now my father's turned over

13:10.023 --> 13:11.024
in his grave.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.192
Thanks a lot for that, too!

13:12.225 --> 13:13.760
Come on, I-I
didn't tell you

13:13.793 --> 13:15.795
what was going on
with me because

13:15.829 --> 13:17.831
I didn't want to stress you out,
you know?

13:17.865 --> 13:19.499
Oh, so if you hadn't
have lost your condo,

13:19.532 --> 13:21.368
would you have still
moved in here with me?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.203
Is this another
"my father will turn over

13:23.236 --> 13:24.704
in his grave" question?

13:24.737 --> 13:25.973
Yup.

13:26.006 --> 13:26.974
Uh, no.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.641
No, I would not have moved in.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.143
Damn it!

13:30.177 --> 13:31.344
You could've at least lied

13:31.378 --> 13:33.513
to get him back
in the right position.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.315
You know what?

13:35.348 --> 13:36.783
You're a bad person.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.885
Hey, come on.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.519
You are.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.722
I am so glad I promised myself
I would never lay eyes on...

13:46.259 --> 13:47.961
I want you to move out.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.362
What?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.698
Are you deaf?
I said move out right now.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.800
Hey. Come on,
let's take a breath here.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.902
It's me.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.836
It's Cousin Stosh.

13:56.870 --> 14:00.373
I have no Cousin Stosh,
Cousin Stosh.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.254
I know you're still in here.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.190
Oh, I can play this game
as long as you can.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.096
Come aboard, Gwendolyn, but
don't forget the sacks of gold

14:23.130 --> 14:24.697
your father left
you when he died.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.099
(higher voice):
Oh, I won't.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.234
They're stashed away.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.102
In my royal underwear.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.503
(kids laugh)
Oh, no!

14:30.537 --> 14:31.571
The gold is too heavy!

14:31.604 --> 14:33.106
We must throw it overboard!

14:33.140 --> 14:35.708
No! I wanted to buy
a 65-inch curved

14:35.742 --> 14:37.410
ultra-high-def television!

14:37.444 --> 14:38.545
(gasps dramatically)

14:38.578 --> 14:40.113
(normal voice):
You see, kids?

14:40.147 --> 14:42.882
Now the prince needs
to learn the hard way.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.785
(gargling)

14:47.287 --> 14:50.057
Oh! Oh, my God! No! No!

14:51.558 --> 14:54.527
I'll see you in hell,
douche bag!

14:54.561 --> 14:55.695
(gargling)

14:55.728 --> 14:58.265
(grunting)

14:59.766 --> 15:02.469
All right, thank you.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.106
Next show's in five minutes.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.475
(knocking)

15:10.243 --> 15:12.112
Yes?
Hi.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.215
I'm Caryn. I'm looking for
Stosh Lewandoski. Is he here?

15:15.248 --> 15:18.085
Oh, yeah, of course he's here.
He's my fiancé.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.752
Your fiancé?
Yeah!

15:19.786 --> 15:22.655
Yup! Yes, I am.

15:22.689 --> 15:26.259
Sue, this is Caryn,
my, uh, French tutor.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.330
(speaking French)

15:31.598 --> 15:33.766
You know, actually
I'm off the clock right now.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.303
Do you mind if I speak
with my tutor in private?

15:36.336 --> 15:37.604
(speaks French)

15:37.637 --> 15:38.671
Okay.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.939
Thanks, honey.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.608
Hey!
Do you ever

15:41.641 --> 15:42.842
tell anyone the truth?

15:42.875 --> 15:44.511
What is this
poor woman gonna say

15:44.544 --> 15:46.113
when you don't marry her?

15:46.146 --> 15:48.181
Oh, same thing as usual,
I'm sure, you know.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.984
We're kind of in a "fool me 12
times, shame on you" situation.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.086
Don't worry. She'll
be fine. What's up?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.122
"What's up?"
Your cousin is devastated.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.791
Stosh, he trusted you,
and you used him!

15:58.825 --> 15:59.959
Well, hey, wait a minute!

15:59.993 --> 16:01.528
I needed a place to crash.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.996
He needed somebody
to hang out with.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.264
It was a very fair deal.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.999
Well, he didn't think
it was a deal.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.700
He thought you were
being sincere.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.202
Yeah, that was
the beauty of it

16:09.236 --> 16:11.171
until you guys opened
your fat pie holes.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.772
Oh, my God.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.141
You have so many walls up.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.875
And it's not just me
who thinks so.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.544
My therapist totally agrees.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.346
Oh, really? She agrees
with someone helping her

16:19.379 --> 16:21.314
pay her mortgage--
who'd have thunk it?

16:21.348 --> 16:23.483
She says you create
walls of deception,

16:23.516 --> 16:25.285
so you never have
to get close to anyone.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.853
You tell that
Park Avenue therapist

16:26.886 --> 16:28.955
that in the real world,
people don't have time

16:28.988 --> 16:31.624
to sit in bean bag chairs and
whine about their feelings.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.526
The world is a tough place;
you got to figure out

16:33.560 --> 16:35.328
what you need to do to
survive, or you drown.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.330
You tell her that and
see what she says.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.898
(door closes)

16:38.931 --> 16:40.667
She said this isn't
about the world

16:40.700 --> 16:43.336
being tough, this is
about you being scared.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.572
Scared of what?
Being vulnerable.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.574
You think if you showed
that side of yourself,

16:47.607 --> 16:49.876
no one will love
you or help you.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.544
Maybe that's because
nobody ever did.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.146
Nobody.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.049
What does your fancy therapist
have to say to that, huh?

16:56.083 --> 16:57.850
She says,

16:57.884 --> 17:00.587
"Go on."

17:00.620 --> 17:03.556
When I was eight,
I was the only kid at school

17:03.590 --> 17:05.992
that didn't have
any baseball cards.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.529
So I asked my mother if I could
have some money to get some.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.863
She said no.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.332
I started crying.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.734
She went right to the window,
opened it,

17:14.767 --> 17:16.169
and yelled out to the street,

17:16.203 --> 17:18.538
"Hey, come up to 11D
if you want to see

17:18.571 --> 17:20.707
the world's biggest crybaby!"

17:20.740 --> 17:23.710
Oh, my goodness.
And they came, too.
A bunch of people came.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.545
One guy even brought
his grandparents.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.880
But that's when I realized
what I needed to do

17:27.914 --> 17:29.416
to survive in this world.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.951
Steal money from her wallet
when she was drunk.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.156
(muffled babbling)

17:39.292 --> 17:40.460
That is heartbreaking.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.595
(sighs)
Rinse and spit.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.099
Hey!

17:46.133 --> 17:48.468
I had to cancel my
session this week.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.869
(grunts)
Sorry.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.205
I didn't have time
for breakfast.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.606
My therapist
says it wasn't

17:53.640 --> 17:55.308
just Eric who needed
help that day.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.877
It was also a little
boy named Stosh.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.479
I couldn't tell him the truth.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.914
It would shatter
his image of me.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.617
Plus, he's so easy to lie to.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.754
How do I make this right?

18:07.787 --> 18:10.957
You could go to him right now
and ask him to forgive you.

18:10.990 --> 18:11.924
But what if he says no?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.793
What if he says yes?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.062
(sniffling)

18:16.095 --> 18:17.730
Okay.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.434
Okay, I'm gonna
go get my jacket.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.470
(door closes)

18:23.503 --> 18:25.272
Son of a bitch!

18:25.305 --> 18:28.007
He stole therapy from me!

18:28.040 --> 18:29.776
And a teeth cleaning.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.319
$7.50, please.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.521
MAN:
There you go.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.763
Oh, hi, Zara!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.765
Hi, Caryn!

18:52.799 --> 18:54.000
Now, why are you
in the backseat

18:54.033 --> 18:55.335
when the passenger
seat's vacant?

18:55.368 --> 18:56.869
That seems so silly.

18:56.903 --> 18:57.837
Eric, can we talk?

18:57.870 --> 18:59.372
$7.50, please.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.341
Eric, you might want to
hear what he has to say.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.642
Yeah, you actually might.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.943
Yeah, listen,
there was a lot of things

19:03.976 --> 19:05.445
that I wanted
to say before,

19:05.478 --> 19:06.679
but I couldn't. But since then,

19:06.713 --> 19:08.481
I've had a lot of good therapy.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.783
Several thousand
dollars worth.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.453
Listen, it all goes back
to my childhood, all right?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.722
I don't even remember
my own mother hugging me.
(car horn honking)

19:15.755 --> 19:17.023
Hey, shut up!

19:17.056 --> 19:19.125
We got a beautiful thing
happening here!

19:19.158 --> 19:22.028
Whoa! He's got crazy eyes.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.030
We're gonna circle back around.
Don't go anywhere.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.365
Don't take any breaks.
Bye.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.966
STOSH: All right,
how do we get out?

19:26.999 --> 19:27.867
Where's the off ramp?
Where's the off ramp?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.369
How do we get out of here?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.506
Okay, go ahead, and skip all the
"Mommy didn't love me" crap.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.309
No, he can't skip that.
That's the most important part.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.077
Okay, then you pay the $7.50.
I didn't go to the ATM.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.880
Ah! Okay!
This is what's happening!

19:40.913 --> 19:44.183
This is going here,
this is going here. Get out!

19:44.217 --> 19:45.885
Good luck to both of you!

19:45.918 --> 19:47.520
ERIC:
$7.50, please.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.690
Oh, geez! It's not even
that great of a bridge!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.091
Bye!

19:52.124 --> 19:53.360
(car horns honking)

19:53.393 --> 19:54.727
Can I come in there, please?

19:54.761 --> 19:56.663
No, this is completely
against regulations.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.231
If you leave me out here,
I'm gonna be

19:58.265 --> 19:59.766
dead in about five seconds.
Please.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.669
Thank you.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.471
All right. Okay.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.708
A little tight in here.

20:08.741 --> 20:09.709
Yup.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.244
Look, Eric.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.846
You're the only one in
our family that liked me.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.282
Or... looked up to me.
(car horn honks)

20:15.315 --> 20:16.683
WOMAN:
Hey, buddy! Come on!

20:16.716 --> 20:19.686
I don't got all day here.
$7.50, please.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.455
So, you liked me and...

20:22.489 --> 20:25.224
I guess I didn't really feel
like I deserved to be liked.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.193
So I gave you
a bunch of crap.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.629
Hey, Sam, Diane. How do I get
to the Westside Highway?

20:29.662 --> 20:31.063
Take FDR to 96th Street.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.699
Zip across town,
it'll get you right there.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.434
Thanks.
Right. Um, gave you

20:34.467 --> 20:35.735
a bunch of crap
when we were kids,

20:35.768 --> 20:36.903
fell in the same
patterns now,

20:36.936 --> 20:38.471
projecting my insecurities,

20:38.505 --> 20:40.407
making up for my
own shortcomings...
MAN: Hey, yo!

20:40.440 --> 20:42.442
$7.50, please.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.243
Cycle-- bullying, hurt,
bullying, hurt.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.446
Never wanted to hurt you.
Love you more than anyone.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.449
Incredibly sorry.
Please forgive me.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.155
I was hoping you'd say
that exact thing.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.057
I love you, kuzyn.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.693
I love you, too, Cousin Stosh.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.231
MAN:
Pardon me. Excuse me.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.766
$7.50, please.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.736
Hey, Lewandoski's
hugging his cousin.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.971
Who's hugging his cousin?
Lewandoski!

21:12.004 --> 21:14.173
Lewandoski clubbing his puffin?

21:14.206 --> 21:15.908
No! Hugging his cousin!

21:15.942 --> 21:17.810
Lewandoski's drugging a Russian!

21:17.844 --> 21:19.512
Lewandoski's got
a concussion?

21:19.546 --> 21:21.448
Lewandoski's got a concussion?!

21:21.481 --> 21:23.516
A concussion?
On top of the scurvy?

21:23.550 --> 21:25.852
That guy's having one bad week.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.654
Hugging his cousin!

21:27.687 --> 21:30.256
This the same guy who won't
let you come to see Mets games?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.792
You the same guy that won't
let him watch the Mets games?

21:32.825 --> 21:34.427
ERIC:
You suck, Kent.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.262
All right!
Come here. Come here.

Good night.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.200
Hmm.
