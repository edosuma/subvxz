Yeah?

37:30.200 --> 37:32.933
-Goodnight, love.
-Goodnight.

37:32.967 --> 37:35.067
Chloe's got
jammies like that, I think.

37:36.067 --> 37:37.400
These are hers.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.800
Okay.

37:41.833 --> 37:43.067
Sleep tight.

37:43.567 --> 37:44.600
Night.

37:48.467 --> 37:51.467
You'd tell us if you knew
where she was,
wouldn't you, Lize?

37:55.200 --> 37:56.800
I miss her too, Uncle Max.

38:00.767 --> 38:02.100
(DOOR CLOSES)

38:05.367 --> 38:06.500
Renae.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.400
Renae, it's Dutch.

38:16.533 --> 38:17.600
Travis?

38:25.233 --> 38:26.533
RENAE: I'm all right, love.

38:27.967 --> 38:29.667
I'm just
getting ready for bed.

38:33.567 --> 38:34.700
A neighbour called.

38:42.267 --> 38:44.200
Can you show me what he did?

38:53.400 --> 38:56.100
You can come with me right now
and make a statement.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.200
I'll drive you
to the hospital.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.067
He's under a lot of pressure.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.667
It'll settle.

39:07.767 --> 39:10.100
My mum thought
the same thing
every Friday night.

39:15.367 --> 39:16.767
(WHISPERS) Don't tell Roy.

39:18.467 --> 39:19.533
Please.

39:32.567 --> 39:34.567
DUTCH: Travis isn't
Gillian's father.

39:35.367 --> 39:36.433
Is he?

39:37.300 --> 39:38.333
No.

39:55.167 --> 39:56.767
Who called?

39:56.800 --> 39:58.433
Someone heard screaming.

39:58.467 --> 40:01.667
They don't have to live
with her going on
about aliens and shit.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.367
(POOL CUE STRIKING)

40:08.600 --> 40:09.600
You want a beer?

40:10.367 --> 40:11.400
No thanks.

40:13.833 --> 40:16.533
Don't know why
you come round here
all high and mighty.

40:16.567 --> 40:18.167
What you think
you're gonna achieve?

40:20.067 --> 40:22.767
Patronising me,
you fucking hypocrite.

40:28.033 --> 40:29.600
What are you on about, Travis?

40:32.333 --> 40:35.267
See, I know what you're up to.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.167
-Do you?
-Yeah, your little enterprise.

40:40.033 --> 40:41.333
I've seen the boats.

40:42.033 --> 40:43.900
I know you're dealing.

40:43.933 --> 40:46.333
I saw Chloe,
so you take yourself right...

40:46.367 --> 40:47.700
-(GRUNTS)
-Prick!

40:48.000 --> 40:49.167
Hey?

40:50.767 --> 40:53.700
You touch Renae again,
and I'll fuckin' kill you.

40:57.033 --> 40:58.200
You feel better?

41:04.867 --> 41:06.333
Oh, shit.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.200
Do you want a drink?

41:33.067 --> 41:34.233
No.

41:35.933 --> 41:37.633
This won't change anything.

41:37.667 --> 41:38.700
I know.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.800
(SOFTLY) Turn around.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.067
(GASPS)

42:47.067 --> 42:48.433
Jeez, you're bleeding.

42:49.433 --> 42:50.500
Hey.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.833
Your nose is bleeding.

42:52.867 --> 42:54.333
Here.

42:54.367 --> 42:55.433
Sit down.

42:59.900 --> 43:01.200
I'll find you a towel.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.600
Here.

43:43.833 --> 43:45.067
Was she here?

43:45.767 --> 43:46.967
What?

43:47.067 --> 43:48.267
Who?

43:49.467 --> 43:51.067
This is Chloe's.

43:51.100 --> 43:53.400
She was wearing it
the first time I saw her.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.567
I remember it.

44:05.333 --> 44:07.567
I picked up some stuff
from her mother's.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.067
It's for work.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.367
That's bullshit.

44:12.433 --> 44:15.100
Were you having sex with her?

44:15.133 --> 44:16.200
It's part of
the investigation.

44:16.233 --> 44:18.767
What, fucking 17-year-olds?

44:18.800 --> 44:20.500
My father's a cop.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.467
Evidence isn't
lying around his house.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.100
You would be surprised.

44:25.667 --> 44:27.267
She was 17.

44:28.467 --> 44:30.467
Why are you
using the past tense?

44:41.100 --> 44:42.333
You're a liar.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.433
Why did you come back?

44:49.100 --> 44:50.400
It's my home.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.167
You don't have a home.

45:28.067 --> 45:30.067
(GIRLS SINGING)

45:34.067 --> 45:35.433

45:37.933 --> 45:41.367
* When she comes walking over

45:43.567 --> 45:46.733

waiting to show her

46:03.867 --> 46:05.133
What are you doing?

46:09.967 --> 46:11.433
Nothing.

46:11.467 --> 46:12.533
What is this?

46:16.833 --> 46:18.100
It's Gillian and I.

46:20.333 --> 46:22.167
Barbara has lost her child.

46:23.467 --> 46:27.067
And you go waltzing down there
with your far-out theories.

46:27.067 --> 46:28.467
I took them some wine.

46:29.167 --> 46:31.367
They are decent people.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.367
What does that mean?

46:34.400 --> 46:37.100
Max said you were
talking about Dr McKenzie.

46:38.933 --> 46:40.333
-I asked her.
-What?

46:42.100 --> 46:43.433
What did you ask her?

46:44.333 --> 46:46.167
I wanted to know
about Gillian.

46:47.133 --> 46:49.400
Why would you ask about that?

46:49.433 --> 46:51.733
-You know what happened.
-No, no, I don't know.

46:51.767 --> 46:52.800
Yes, you do.

46:54.833 --> 46:56.167
When are you leaving?

47:02.067 --> 47:03.167
I'm not.

47:05.133 --> 47:07.067
Who cleaned me up?

47:07.100 --> 47:08.767
I had blood on me, didn't I?

47:10.067 --> 47:11.967
When you
found me in the forest.

47:12.067 --> 47:13.100
Are you drunk?

47:13.133 --> 47:14.267
You're drunk, aren't you?

47:14.300 --> 47:16.667
Why don't you
go back to your job in London?

47:16.700 --> 47:17.700
I resigned.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.200
Was it Gillian's blood?

47:21.233 --> 47:23.867
I don't know
whose blood it was!

47:23.900 --> 47:25.767
You talk about decency.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.500
You can't
speak to me like this.

47:27.533 --> 47:30.300
Why did you
have an affair with Renae
when you had me and Mum?

47:31.100 --> 47:32.700
You make me sick.

47:32.733 --> 47:35.233
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?

47:35.267 --> 47:36.767
Truth?

47:36.800 --> 47:38.667
You have no idea.

47:38.700 --> 47:41.100
You're the only one
that knows what happened.

47:41.133 --> 47:42.700
You! You alone!

47:42.733 --> 47:44.067
You know what happened.

47:44.067 --> 47:45.500
And it's all in here.
