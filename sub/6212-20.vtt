00:01.133 --> 00:03.635
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:03.635 --> 00:04.970
Hello?

00:04.970 --> 00:07.005
Hello?

00:07.005 --> 00:07.939
That's weird.
They hung up.

00:07.939 --> 00:09.474
That's the second time
that's happened today.

00:09.474 --> 00:10.509
Did you hear
a cell door

00:10.509 --> 00:11.543
clanging in
the background?

00:11.543 --> 00:12.210
No.

00:12.210 --> 00:13.912
Then it wasn't
my mom.

00:13.912 --> 00:16.448
Hey, look, I found an old
box of macaroni for dinner.

00:16.448 --> 00:17.449
Whoa, whoa--
let me see

00:17.449 --> 00:18.717
the expiration
date on that.

00:18.717 --> 00:20.952
I think it's
in Roman numerals.

00:20.952 --> 00:22.154
Have anything better?

00:22.154 --> 00:23.889
Tater tots...

00:23.889 --> 00:25.891
A freezer-burned
pot pie...

00:25.891 --> 00:29.828
and a UFO--
unidentified foil object.

00:29.828 --> 00:30.929
Do you realize,
in the '50s

00:30.929 --> 00:32.764
they thought this was
a well-balanced meal?

00:32.764 --> 00:34.232
Well, in the '50s
they also thought

00:34.232 --> 00:35.867
that hiding underneath
your desk could

00:35.867 --> 00:37.202
save you from
a nuclear attack.

00:37.202 --> 00:39.504
That only works if the desk
is 80 feet underground

00:39.504 --> 00:40.839
and made
of a titanium alloy.

00:40.839 --> 00:42.374
And speaking of nuclear fallout

00:42.374 --> 00:44.476
I survived another
dinner with my parents.

00:44.476 --> 00:46.778
Ooh, and saved us
from fossilized macaroni.

00:46.778 --> 00:48.080
Hand over the leftovers.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.981
The entire evening
was a nightmare.

00:49.981 --> 00:52.417
They maligned every aspect
of my character and my life.

00:52.417 --> 00:53.618
That's awful.

00:53.618 --> 00:56.054
Oh, your mom put raisins
in the kugel.

00:56.054 --> 00:58.023
I don't even know
why I continue going.

00:58.023 --> 01:01.059
These Sunday night dinners
are becoming a sadistic ritual.

01:01.059 --> 01:02.728
It's important to
have family traditions.

01:02.728 --> 01:03.929
Do you taste
this kishka?

01:03.929 --> 01:05.230
It's to die for.

01:05.230 --> 01:08.233
It's the same thing
every time I go home.

01:08.233 --> 01:09.835
My father
<i>hoks</i> me about forgetting

01:09.835 --> 01:11.169
this paranormal nonsense

01:11.169 --> 01:12.771
and switching my major
to accounting

01:12.771 --> 01:15.040
while my mother shovels food
into my plate and says

01:15.040 --> 01:16.908
"Why don't you
come home more often?"

01:16.908 --> 01:18.043
It wouldn't hurt.

01:18.043 --> 01:19.745
You'd think
my father would realize

01:19.745 --> 01:21.113
I'd rather stick
needles in my eyes

01:21.113 --> 01:23.482
than join
the family business.

01:23.482 --> 01:24.382
Well, what are you saying?

01:24.382 --> 01:25.951
That there's no room
for a paranormal researcher

01:25.951 --> 01:27.285
at a CPA firm?

01:27.285 --> 01:29.221
That's about as good
as my father's latest joke--

01:29.221 --> 01:30.222
changing the company name

01:30.222 --> 01:33.358
to Goodman, Goodman
and Not So Goodman.

01:33.358 --> 01:35.227
That's funny.

01:35.227 --> 01:35.861
Or cruel.

01:35.861 --> 01:37.796
You know, depends on
your point of view.

01:40.499 --> 01:47.305
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:47.305 --> 01:53.411

02:16.701 --> 02:18.470
For your next
astronomy paper

02:18.470 --> 02:19.404
you're free to choose

02:19.404 --> 02:21.506
your own topic.

02:21.740 --> 02:24.876
It should be double-
spaced, ten pages.

02:24.876 --> 02:26.645
Due next week, and no

02:26.645 --> 02:29.781
there is no bonus assignment
for extra credit.

02:30.248 --> 02:32.117
Never hurts to ask.

02:32.117 --> 02:33.051
This should be a breeze.

02:33.051 --> 02:35.987
I can spit out ten pages just
downloading NASA's website.

02:35.987 --> 02:37.455
And one other thing--

02:37.455 --> 02:39.457
No downloading NASA's website

02:39.457 --> 02:41.827
or any other
scientific mumbo jumbo

02:41.827 --> 02:43.895
that you get
off the Internet.

02:43.895 --> 02:47.265
I want it totally
understandable. Simple.

02:47.265 --> 02:49.000
In layman's terms.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.669
Which is why you'll be
presenting it

02:50.669 --> 02:52.470
orally to the class.

02:52.470 --> 02:53.638
I don't believe this.

02:53.638 --> 02:55.173
First we can't
download our reports.

02:55.173 --> 02:57.475
Then she expects us to
actually understand them.

02:57.475 --> 02:58.844
What kind of wacko
approach to teaching

02:58.844 --> 02:59.845
is this, anyway?

02:59.845 --> 03:00.946
This is quite a quandary.

03:00.946 --> 03:02.948
You have to intelligently
discuss a complicated topic

03:02.948 --> 03:04.883
yet it has to be
understandable

03:04.883 --> 03:06.651
to the lowest common
denominator.

03:06.651 --> 03:08.186
How do we do that?

03:09.154 --> 03:11.423
I just thought of a way.

03:11.423 --> 03:12.657
Is Aunt Hilda here?

03:12.657 --> 03:14.960
I got to run
my astronomy report by her.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.229
You want to talk to
Hilda about science?

03:17.229 --> 03:18.830
Dear, that's like
asking Hirohito

03:18.830 --> 03:20.198
where to get
a good pizza.

03:20.198 --> 03:22.500
I, on the other hand,
have three doctorates

03:22.500 --> 03:23.368
in intergalactic studies

03:23.368 --> 03:26.938
and am personally credited
with discovering 17 moons.

03:26.938 --> 03:27.873
Well, my professor says

03:27.873 --> 03:29.407
that my report
has to be so clear

03:29.407 --> 03:31.610
that even the simplest person
can understand it.

03:31.610 --> 03:32.677
Better wait for Hilda.

03:32.677 --> 03:34.846
She's on a date with
a witch from Venus.

03:34.846 --> 03:36.481
She met him through
that dating service--

03:36.481 --> 03:38.250
Great Hexpectations.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.751
What is all this?

03:39.751 --> 03:42.254
Oh, extra food Miles brought
home from dinner with his
family.

03:42.254 --> 03:43.588
They torture him
about becoming an accountant

03:43.588 --> 03:44.890
but send him home with gold.

03:44.890 --> 03:45.891
This looks unusual.

03:45.891 --> 03:47.392
Ugh. And not unlike

03:47.392 --> 03:49.628
my Uncle Goliath's
kidney stone.

03:49.628 --> 03:50.662
It's matzo ball soup.

03:50.662 --> 03:52.597
So good you just
want to say, "Oy."

03:52.597 --> 03:55.400
That's Yiddish for "Yum."

03:55.400 --> 03:56.167
Oy.

03:59.537 --> 04:02.474
That was the most incredible
experience of my life.

04:02.474 --> 04:04.042
So Elliot was nice?

04:04.042 --> 04:04.776
Beats me.

04:04.776 --> 04:06.111
I was talking about his car.

04:06.111 --> 04:07.445
That thing really flies.

04:07.445 --> 04:09.781
Literally-- he's got
a flying car, Zellie.

04:09.781 --> 04:12.584
( <i>rocket engines roaring</i> )

04:15.320 --> 04:16.521
UFO!

04:16.521 --> 04:18.189
It looks just like a Cadillac.

04:18.189 --> 04:19.758
So, tell us
about your date.

04:19.758 --> 04:20.926
Give us details.

04:20.926 --> 04:23.662
It's a 1,000-cylinder,
hydrogen-fueled turbo

04:23.662 --> 04:27.098
with the coolest chrome fins
on the afterburners.

04:27.532 --> 04:28.833
Oh. You mean Elliot.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.635
Well, let me just say this.

04:30.635 --> 04:32.904
It's true what they say
about men from Venus.

04:32.904 --> 04:34.339
They have great suspension.

04:34.339 --> 04:35.974
As opposed
to those cads from Mars

04:35.974 --> 04:39.044
who leave the toilet seat up and
drink out of the milk carton.

04:39.044 --> 04:40.712
I did it <i>once.</i>

04:40.712 --> 04:41.913
Let it go.

04:41.913 --> 04:43.281
Well, now that we've
got a report

04:43.281 --> 04:44.482
on your date
and his car

04:44.482 --> 04:46.017
I want to run
my astronomy report by you.

04:46.017 --> 04:47.719
Of course. See--

04:47.719 --> 04:48.720
you're not the only one

04:48.720 --> 04:51.556
Sabrina values for her
intelligence. Shoot.

04:51.556 --> 04:53.625
"The speed of light is the speed
at which light travels..."

04:53.625 --> 04:56.361
Whoa whoa hoa. Back up,
Einstein-- you lost me.

04:56.361 --> 04:58.196
Maybe I should just give my
report with finger puppets.

04:58.196 --> 05:00.799
Oh, I love finger puppets.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.335
So, you ready to give
your presentation?

05:03.335 --> 05:05.370
Actually, I'm ready
to give two presentations.

05:05.370 --> 05:07.872
One is my standard ten-minute
cocktail party icebreaker

05:07.872 --> 05:09.975
about the molecular
composition of sunspots.

05:09.975 --> 05:13.011
The other is really
going out on a limb.

05:13.011 --> 05:14.446
I better go
with the safe choice.

05:14.446 --> 05:16.114
Safe choice? That
doesn't sound like you.

05:16.114 --> 05:17.615
Then I know I'm
on the right track.

05:17.615 --> 05:19.751
Miles come on, you got
to go out on a limb.

05:19.751 --> 05:20.685
I mean, that's what I
love about you.

05:20.685 --> 05:22.220
You're not afraid
to take risks.

05:22.220 --> 05:22.887
Really?

05:22.887 --> 05:24.489
Yeah, I mean look at what
you're wearing.

05:26.758 --> 05:28.259
"Therefore, it
is hypothesized

05:28.259 --> 05:29.861
"that quasars are
optical illusions

05:29.861 --> 05:31.529
"created
by gravitational lensing

05:31.529 --> 05:33.264
"of the photons emanating
from a large mass

05:33.264 --> 05:36.434
at the center
of an active galaxy. The end."

05:37.702 --> 05:40.038
Wow. Who knew you could
deliver a ten-page report

05:40.038 --> 05:41.473
without ever taking a breath?

05:41.473 --> 05:43.441
Although, towards the end,
the lack of oxygen

05:43.441 --> 05:45.043
was causing your left eye
to wander.

05:45.043 --> 05:46.378
I'm just happy it's
over and I never

05:46.378 --> 05:48.213
have to think
about quasars again.

05:48.213 --> 05:49.914
Thank you, Roxie, or should I

05:49.914 --> 05:53.718
be thanking
your Internet service provider?

05:53.918 --> 05:55.987
Sabrina, you're next.

05:55.987 --> 05:58.723
Uh... My report
is on the speed of light.

05:58.723 --> 06:00.692
The speed of light is fast.

06:00.692 --> 06:01.393
It's <i>really</i> fast.

06:01.393 --> 06:03.661
Like, you know
how the cheetah's, like

06:03.661 --> 06:05.130
the fastest land animal.

06:05.130 --> 06:08.566
It's, like, way, way,
way, way, way faster than that.

06:10.602 --> 06:12.437
You said to keep it simple.

06:12.437 --> 06:14.105
I was all set to present
my report on sunspots

06:14.105 --> 06:16.674
including my hypothesis
that the disco era

06:16.674 --> 06:19.210
was influenced
by a minor solar flare

06:19.210 --> 06:20.879
but then,
a good friend convinced me

06:20.879 --> 06:22.680
to go out on a limb.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.848
Last night...

06:23.848 --> 06:26.484
I, Miles Goodman

06:26.484 --> 06:30.989
witnessed an alien spacecraft
traverse the night sky.

06:30.989 --> 06:32.023
( <i>class laughing</i> )

06:32.023 --> 06:34.392
Oy. Not in the "yum"
sense of the word.

06:34.392 --> 06:36.227
Surprisingly,
it looked like a Cadillac

06:36.227 --> 06:37.796
yet it was stylishly adorned

06:37.796 --> 06:40.498
with chrome fins
on the afterburners.

06:40.498 --> 06:42.300
Why can't Aunt Hilda
take the bus like everyone else?

06:42.300 --> 06:43.268
It was incredible.

06:43.268 --> 06:44.769
There it flew,
flashing a red light

06:44.769 --> 06:47.605
that I can only interpret
as a left turn signal.

06:47.605 --> 06:49.340
I got another
interpretation--

06:49.340 --> 06:50.408
you're a nut job.

06:50.408 --> 06:51.443
( <i>class giggling</i> )

06:51.443 --> 06:52.544
I know what I saw.

06:52.544 --> 06:54.045
I-I-It was a flying car.

06:54.045 --> 06:56.247
Or maybe it was
a rubber-padded
spaceship

06:56.247 --> 06:57.949
coming to take you away.

06:57.949 --> 07:00.618
I'm sure it wasn't a medical
vehicle, because there weren't

07:00.618 --> 07:02.420
any international markings
for Red Cross.

07:02.420 --> 07:04.789
You're so loopy,
Goodman.

07:04.789 --> 07:06.691
Maybe what you saw
looked like a spacecraft

07:06.691 --> 07:08.326
but was really
a weather balloon.

07:08.326 --> 07:10.428
Afterburners
on a weather balloon?

07:10.428 --> 07:11.529
Now who's loopy?

07:11.529 --> 07:13.198
Still you.

07:13.798 --> 07:15.033
Aunt Hilda,
we need to talk.

07:15.033 --> 07:17.035
Nothing good ever comes
after that sentence.

07:17.035 --> 07:19.237
Miles saw your boyfriend's
flying car.

07:19.237 --> 07:20.171
See?

07:20.171 --> 07:23.374
He gave a report on it
in Astronomy, and was
totally humiliated.

07:23.374 --> 07:26.044
I had to cover with some stupid
story about a weather balloon.

07:26.044 --> 07:30.548
You called a top-of-the-line
fully loaded Venusian cruiser
a weather balloon?

07:30.548 --> 07:32.951
Look, the point is,
if you're going to date
people from other planets

07:32.951 --> 07:34.052
you have to be discreet.

07:34.052 --> 07:35.954
Isn't that what I've
always taught you?

07:35.954 --> 07:37.889
Wait a minute, that's what
you've always taught me.

07:37.889 --> 07:39.557
I'm sorry.
I just got carried away.

07:39.557 --> 07:42.327
I've just never dated a guy
with such cool wheels before.

07:42.327 --> 07:45.063
Aunt Hilda, you dated the guy
who invented the wheel.

07:45.063 --> 07:46.064
Oh, Miles.

07:46.064 --> 07:47.098
Do you have a moment?

07:47.098 --> 07:48.199
Uh, yes, but
make it quick.

07:48.199 --> 07:49.667
I'm the target
of mass mockery

07:49.667 --> 07:51.035
and unless I'm
fast on my feet

07:51.035 --> 07:52.470
I may inadvertently get pantsed.

07:52.470 --> 07:53.738
Well, this won't take long.

07:53.738 --> 07:55.206
I wanted to ask you
for the recipe

07:55.206 --> 07:58.042
to your mother's
delectable matzo ball soup.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.712
I'd like to help you,
but my mother swore she's
taking it to her grave

08:00.712 --> 08:02.614
along with my bubee Esther's
antique brooch

08:02.614 --> 08:04.649
which I interpret
as a direct slap
to my Aunt Ceil.

08:04.649 --> 08:06.184
Oh, but I must have
that recipe.

08:06.184 --> 08:08.353
Surely you could
get it for me.

08:08.353 --> 08:10.622
Believe me, Zelda, I would
do anything for you

08:10.622 --> 08:13.191
but my mother keeps
that secret recipe
in her girdle drawer

08:13.191 --> 08:14.526
and no one goes in there.

08:14.526 --> 08:17.295
Unfortunately...
not even my mother.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.765
I'm really glad you decided
to go out with me again.

08:20.765 --> 08:23.201
I... I wasn't sure
that you liked me.

08:23.201 --> 08:24.569
Don't be ridiculous,
Elliot.

08:24.569 --> 08:25.637
I'm very fond of you.

08:25.637 --> 08:27.639
Now, where's the turbo?

08:27.639 --> 08:29.374
I don't think
that you're ready for that yet.

08:29.374 --> 08:32.477
Besides, I think we should
wait until we reach a less
congested area to kick it in.

08:32.477 --> 08:33.511
Or we could kick it in now

08:33.511 --> 08:36.347
and get out of this
congestion faster.

08:36.648 --> 08:39.184
I know-- "Driving
is a privilege.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.452
Safety first."
Blah, blah, blah.

08:41.519 --> 08:43.154
Hilda, I'm beginning to think
the only reason you're going out
with me

08:43.154 --> 08:45.023
is because you like
my vehicle.

08:45.023 --> 08:46.324
That's not true.

08:46.324 --> 08:48.226
I think you're a very
sweet, sensitive guy

08:48.226 --> 08:49.994
and I'm lucky to
have found you.

08:49.994 --> 08:51.896
I feel the same way
about you.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.903
I can't believe
I have to redo
my report.

08:58.903 --> 09:00.505
Sure, it was a little
factoid heavy

09:00.505 --> 09:02.273
but I didn't go off
like a crazy person

09:02.273 --> 09:05.843
about a flying Cadillac
taking the carpool lane
to Pluto.

09:05.843 --> 09:07.245
Miles isn't crazy.

09:07.245 --> 09:09.080
Yes, he is, and I'll tell
you who's even crazier:

09:09.080 --> 09:10.515
his good friend
who told him

09:10.515 --> 09:11.883
he should
make a fool of himself.

09:11.883 --> 09:14.519
His good friend
had the best of intentions.

09:14.519 --> 09:15.453
I'm just guessing.

09:15.453 --> 09:16.421
( <i>phone rings</i> )

09:18.356 --> 09:19.591
Hello?

09:19.591 --> 09:21.259
Hello?

09:21.259 --> 09:23.628
Another hang up. This is
getting a little freaky.

09:23.628 --> 09:25.863
I mean if the lights go out,
and someone walks
in here with a knife...

09:25.863 --> 09:27.065
( <i>both shrieking</i> )

09:27.065 --> 09:28.900
That's the best reaction
I've had all day.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.102
Sorry, we thought you were
the psychotic hang up caller.

09:31.102 --> 09:32.370
Yeah I wish.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.505
Professor Hutchins just
called me on the carpet.

09:34.505 --> 09:35.840
She said, "Science
has nothing to do

09:35.840 --> 09:37.775
with little green men
in souped-up spaceships."

09:37.775 --> 09:39.344
Then she said I'm
"an embarrassment

09:39.344 --> 09:40.945
to the Paranormal
Studies program."

09:40.945 --> 09:44.782
What's embarrassing is there <i>is</i>
a Paranormal Studies program.

09:44.782 --> 09:46.217
The point is...
that when the head

09:46.217 --> 09:48.419
of the Paranormal Department
calls you a freaking fruitcake

09:48.419 --> 09:50.255
it's time to reevaluate
the rest of your life.

09:50.255 --> 09:51.456
Miles, you're not crazy.

09:51.456 --> 09:52.957
You're just as sane as anyone.

09:52.957 --> 09:54.826
That's not much comfort
coming from you.

09:54.826 --> 09:56.060
You're the one who told me
to go out on a limb

09:56.060 --> 09:57.695
and then told the class
I saw a weather balloon.

09:57.695 --> 09:58.696
I was just trying to come up

09:58.696 --> 10:00.231
with a more
plausible explanation.

10:00.231 --> 10:02.100
Then other words I'm a freaking
fruitcake.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.301
Miles, I didn't say that.

10:03.301 --> 10:04.302
Do you or do you
not believe

10:04.302 --> 10:06.170
that I saw a spaceship--
yes or no?

10:06.170 --> 10:09.774
Well... I believe that...
you think you saw one.

10:09.774 --> 10:11.376
So you think
I'm delusional?

10:11.376 --> 10:13.778
No, I just think there are
millions of possibilities.

10:13.778 --> 10:15.113
No, there's only one.

10:15.113 --> 10:16.881
I'm going to forget
all this paranormal nonsense

10:16.881 --> 10:17.915
and become an accountant.

10:17.915 --> 10:19.384
Miles, you can't do that.

10:19.384 --> 10:20.451
Watch me.

10:20.451 --> 10:22.020
My father will finally
get his wish.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.123
From now on, it's going to be
Goodman, Goodman and Goodman.

10:25.423 --> 10:26.391
( <i>sighs</i> )

10:26.924 --> 10:28.226
Oy.

10:33.097 --> 10:34.966
I can't believe Miles decided
to be an accountant.

10:34.966 --> 10:37.402
He's always wanted to be
a paranormal researcher all of
his life.

10:37.402 --> 10:39.037
I mean, even as a toddler,
he was convinced

10:39.037 --> 10:41.339
that Bert and Ernie were
visitors from another planet.

10:41.339 --> 10:42.974
I just wish those two
would come out

10:42.974 --> 10:44.709
and put that rumor to rest.

10:44.709 --> 10:45.276
Look, Sabrina

10:45.276 --> 10:46.244
I think this Miles thing

10:46.244 --> 10:47.879
is good news for you.

10:47.879 --> 10:49.280
Now he won't be nosing around

10:49.280 --> 10:50.882
looking for
supernatural phenomena

10:50.882 --> 10:51.983
and you won't have
to worry about

10:51.983 --> 10:53.885
being exposed as a witch.

10:53.885 --> 10:54.919
No, I just have to worry about

10:54.919 --> 10:56.220
having killed a man's spirit.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.389
Oh, please, who
hasn't done that?

10:58.389 --> 11:00.491
I just wish I could have
looked Miles in the eyes

11:00.491 --> 11:02.493
and told him that I know
he saw that spacecraft.

11:02.493 --> 11:04.395
Then maybe he'd still
be following his dream.

11:04.395 --> 11:05.963
Sabrina, you had no choice.

11:05.963 --> 11:07.198
You couldn't tell
Miles the truth.

11:07.198 --> 11:08.366
Just like I can't
tell Elliot

11:08.366 --> 11:11.035
I'm only dating him
for his big block.

11:11.035 --> 11:13.338
What? It's an engine.

11:13.938 --> 11:15.340
Hey, great news.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.142
I just sold my freshman
accounting books to Goodman.

11:18.142 --> 11:19.444
That's horrible.

11:19.444 --> 11:20.745
Not for me.

11:20.745 --> 11:22.647
And, frankly,
changing his major's

11:22.647 --> 11:24.549
the best decision
Miles ever made.

11:24.549 --> 11:26.851
Having your dreams crushed
is your idea of a good time?

11:26.851 --> 11:28.886
Let me guess-- in <i>Peter Pan,</i>
when Tinkerbell dies

11:28.886 --> 11:31.389
you're the only guy not clapping
to bring her back to life.

11:31.389 --> 11:33.591
That little fairy
drove me nuts.

11:33.591 --> 11:34.625
Sabrina, you have
to look at it

11:34.625 --> 11:36.594
from a pragmatic
point of view.

11:36.594 --> 11:38.262
There's not a lot
of job opportunities

11:38.262 --> 11:41.232
for guys with a BS in UFOs.

11:41.232 --> 11:41.966
That's true.

11:41.966 --> 11:43.267
On career day, you rarely see

11:43.267 --> 11:45.036
a paranormal recruiting booth.

11:45.036 --> 11:47.405
And better Miles comes
to this realization now

11:47.405 --> 11:51.376
rather than spending $80,000
on an education he'll never use.

11:51.376 --> 11:52.543
I guess you're right.

11:52.543 --> 11:54.045
College is a time
that should be spent

11:54.045 --> 11:56.247
doing the thing that prepares
you for your life ahead.

11:56.247 --> 11:58.149
We're out of toilet paper
in the men's room.

11:58.149 --> 11:59.317
I'm on it.

12:01.085 --> 12:01.919
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

12:04.255 --> 12:05.857
Hello?

12:05.857 --> 12:07.392
Hello?

12:07.392 --> 12:08.593
This is really getting old.

12:08.593 --> 12:09.694
Not unlike this kugel.

12:09.694 --> 12:12.196
It just doesn't keep
like the kishke.

12:12.897 --> 12:14.665
So, Miles,
you seem to really be

12:14.665 --> 12:16.634
getting into
those accounting books.

12:16.634 --> 12:18.403
You got to love
debits and credits.

12:18.403 --> 12:19.871
They're all
perfectly logical

12:19.871 --> 12:21.572
and spelled out
in black and red.

12:21.572 --> 12:23.875
Don't you miss the thrill
of the unexplainable?

12:23.875 --> 12:25.943
What I don't miss
is the pain of being ridiculed.

12:25.943 --> 12:28.212
When you tell people you see
a seven, they believe you

12:28.212 --> 12:29.614
instead of calling you
a nut job.

12:29.614 --> 12:31.783
You know, Miles, I know what
you're going through.

12:31.783 --> 12:34.385
I mean, I know what it's like
to have people think you're
different.

12:34.385 --> 12:36.754
Yeah right, what would you
know about being different?

12:36.754 --> 12:37.955
Well, there happens to be

12:37.955 --> 12:39.424
a lot about me
that you don't know.

12:39.424 --> 12:40.091
Like?

12:40.091 --> 12:41.159
Like I tend to

12:41.159 --> 12:42.393
talk too much about myself.

12:42.393 --> 12:43.494
Back to you.

12:43.494 --> 12:44.262
Face it, Sabrina

12:44.262 --> 12:45.930
you know nothing
about being different.

12:45.930 --> 12:49.267
You're just a nice, normal,
well-adjusted person.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.635
( <i>phone rings</i> )

12:50.635 --> 12:51.836
Look, knock it off, psycho!

12:51.836 --> 12:53.404
I don't have time for your...

12:53.838 --> 12:55.072
Oh, sorry.

12:55.072 --> 12:56.073
Miles, it's Garth.

12:56.073 --> 12:56.941
He wants to know
if you want to go

12:56.941 --> 12:59.177
to the Sci-Fi Club screening of
<i>Blade Runner</i> tonight.

12:59.177 --> 13:00.645
Tell him I'm busy.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.413
He says they're going
to watch it backwards

13:02.413 --> 13:04.382
and look for hidden meaning.

13:04.382 --> 13:06.717
Sorry, Garth, but I'm
joining the real world.

13:07.852 --> 13:09.253
Are you sure
you want to do this?

13:09.253 --> 13:11.322
I mean, you used to really enjoy
going out with those...

13:11.322 --> 13:12.423
Freaks?

13:12.423 --> 13:15.193
Sabrina, I know I've made
the right decision.

13:15.193 --> 13:16.360
I can definitely see myself

13:16.360 --> 13:18.729
being an accountant
for the next 50 years.

13:18.729 --> 13:21.899
45, if I go with my father's
extended workday plan.

13:21.899 --> 13:24.101
Well, maybe you can,
but I can't.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.305
Wait a minute, of course I can.

13:28.072 --> 13:28.773
Uh...

13:28.773 --> 13:30.441
Prove me wrong
and allay my fears

13:30.441 --> 13:32.944
Show me Miles in 15 years.

13:35.112 --> 13:36.247
Here's your tax return,
Mr. Willoughby

13:36.247 --> 13:37.915
and you'll be happy to know
I was able to write off

13:37.915 --> 13:39.784
your entire safari to Africa.

13:39.784 --> 13:42.053
And, if the Feds ever ask

13:42.053 --> 13:44.689
Mr. G. Raffe
and Mr. L. E. Phant

13:44.689 --> 13:46.390
are your Serengeti sales reps.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.192
Miles, you're a genius.

13:48.192 --> 13:49.727
You saved me again.

13:49.727 --> 13:51.429
Well, it's easy when you do
what you love.

13:51.429 --> 13:52.497
Great, I was wrong!

13:52.497 --> 13:54.365
Miles is happy
being an accountant.

13:54.365 --> 13:54.999
And why not?

13:54.999 --> 13:57.502
I mean, he's successful,
he's got a nice office

13:57.502 --> 14:00.571
big desk, picture
of the wife and kids...

14:00.571 --> 14:01.739
Is that Roxie?

14:01.739 --> 14:03.841
Just need your John Hancock
on this.

14:03.841 --> 14:05.343
Will you excuse me?

14:05.343 --> 14:06.110
Sure.

14:17.722 --> 14:20.825
( <i>screaming</i> )

14:20.825 --> 14:23.461
( <i>knocking</i> )

14:23.461 --> 14:24.195
Sorry to barge in

14:24.195 --> 14:27.732
but I can't let you
ruin your life.

14:27.732 --> 14:29.500
Sabrina, my life
is just beginning--

14:29.500 --> 14:32.436
a new life enriched
with the joy of
long-form deductions.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.604
No, you're going
to hate deductions.

14:33.604 --> 14:34.705
They are going to make
you miserable.

14:34.705 --> 14:35.806
I know this for a fact.

14:35.806 --> 14:36.807
How do you know--
what'd you do?

14:36.807 --> 14:37.575
Look into a crystal ball

14:37.575 --> 14:39.744
and see my future?
-Something like that.

14:39.744 --> 14:41.078
Look, part of
being Miles Goodman

14:41.078 --> 14:42.980
is you know collecting
stuff like this.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.882
Radioactive isotope
from a Russian warhead.

14:44.882 --> 14:46.851
Oh, are you insane?

14:46.851 --> 14:47.552
Yes, you are.

14:47.552 --> 14:48.853
And that is my point.

14:48.853 --> 14:50.621
See, anyone that
collects stuff like this

14:50.621 --> 14:53.224
is not meant
to be an accountant.

14:53.224 --> 14:54.625
That's why I'm giving it away.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.661
By the way, I'd wash
my hands if I were you.

14:56.661 --> 14:58.529
Several thousand times.

14:58.796 --> 15:01.165
Dipotassium phosphate.

15:01.165 --> 15:04.835
Dipotassium
phosphate.

15:04.835 --> 15:06.904
Sodium silicaluminate.

15:06.904 --> 15:09.807
Sodium
silicaluminate.

15:09.807 --> 15:11.375
And schmaltz.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.344
Schmaltz.

15:13.344 --> 15:15.179
This should do it.

15:17.481 --> 15:20.351
Voila!

15:20.351 --> 15:21.919
If my calculations are right

15:21.919 --> 15:25.022
I will have just replicated
the exact molecular structure

15:25.022 --> 15:27.458
of Mrs. Goodman's matzo balls.

15:27.458 --> 15:30.995
Prepare yourself
for gastronomic nirvana.

15:30.995 --> 15:32.296
Brelch!

15:32.296 --> 15:36.167
if this is nirvana,
I'm Hadassah Lieberman.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.735
Oh, Sabrina,
good, you're here.

15:37.735 --> 15:39.704
I need
a second opinion.

15:39.704 --> 15:41.906
Try this.

15:41.906 --> 15:42.974
What do you think?

15:42.974 --> 15:45.076
Make them smaller,
have Tiger Woods autograph them

15:45.076 --> 15:47.211
and you've got the hottest
seller at the PGA tour.

15:47.211 --> 15:49.480
I don't understand
what went wrong.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.483
This matzo ball
is a chemically perfect clone.

15:52.483 --> 15:55.019
Zelly, you're missing
one key ingredient.

15:55.019 --> 15:55.553
What?

15:55.553 --> 15:56.721
Something I learned about

15:56.721 --> 16:00.558
in my little village
of Anatevka-- love.

16:00.558 --> 16:01.859
Okay, before he breaks
out in a chorus

16:01.859 --> 16:04.595
of "Sunrise, Sunset,"
I need to talk
to you about Miles.

16:04.595 --> 16:06.998
If only I could tell him I
know he saw that spacecraft

16:06.998 --> 16:09.867
he'd give up this crazy idea
of being an accountant.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.168
But you can't tell him.

16:11.168 --> 16:13.337
That would be admitting
that you have special powers.

16:13.337 --> 16:14.672
Exactly.

16:14.672 --> 16:16.540
Hmm. This is a conundrum.

16:16.540 --> 16:20.144
Not to mention a confounding
and perplexing problem.

16:20.144 --> 16:22.413
I just wish there was some way
I could validate Miles

16:22.413 --> 16:24.548
and let him know
he's not alone.

16:24.548 --> 16:27.051
Well, I'm off for my next
flying lesson with Elliot.

16:27.051 --> 16:28.085
Tonight he's going to show me

16:28.085 --> 16:30.788
how to properly grip
his throttle.

16:30.788 --> 16:33.224
That's what makes
the big block fly.

16:33.224 --> 16:35.292
And don't worry,
we won't let anyone see us.

16:35.292 --> 16:38.863
Although, seeing is believing,
if you catch my drift.

16:38.863 --> 16:40.898
Caught it, and am already
formulating a plan.

16:40.898 --> 16:42.733
Oh. That's great.

16:42.733 --> 16:44.301
You're making us
a new croquet set--

16:44.301 --> 16:45.536
just in time for summer.

16:45.536 --> 16:46.303
( <i>thudding</i> )

16:48.172 --> 16:50.241
MILES:
I should be practicing
my ledger entries.

16:50.241 --> 16:52.543
I'm really struggling
with those European sevens.

16:52.543 --> 16:53.644
Well, Miles,
you said you'd help me

16:53.644 --> 16:55.780
identify constellations
for astronomy class.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.115
Besides, you can still do
your accounting on the roof.

16:58.115 --> 16:59.450
I'll suggest that
to my father.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.786
Perhaps this year, our firm
can prepare tax returns

17:01.786 --> 17:04.655
on the steeple of
the Old North Church.

17:07.725 --> 17:09.427
It's 9:10.

17:09.427 --> 17:10.961
They should have been here
by now.

17:10.961 --> 17:12.630
Who?

17:12.630 --> 17:14.432
Uh... geese.

17:14.432 --> 17:15.800
You know, they-they, uh,
they...

17:15.800 --> 17:17.868
they're very punctual
with their migration.

17:19.236 --> 17:21.605
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

17:21.605 --> 17:22.640
Look!

17:23.040 --> 17:25.276
Oh, my God,
do you see that?

17:26.110 --> 17:28.345
Absolutely-- Now, that is
the Big Dipper, right?

17:28.345 --> 17:30.247
Not the constellation,
the spaceship.

17:30.247 --> 17:31.515
Please tell me
you see that.

17:31.515 --> 17:32.717
Wow! It is a spaceship!

17:32.717 --> 17:34.518
Unbelievable!

17:34.518 --> 17:35.653
It's beautiful.

17:35.653 --> 17:38.289
A technological miracle.

17:40.558 --> 17:44.228
Although the driver appears
to be slightly inebriated.

17:44.228 --> 17:46.964
Oh, that's probably
just a problem
with the big block.

17:46.964 --> 17:47.998
That's an engine.

17:48.199 --> 17:49.734
I know that.

17:49.734 --> 17:51.368
I can't get it
into fifth gear!

17:51.368 --> 17:53.337
Uh, that's 'cause
this only has four.

17:53.337 --> 17:55.106
( <i>gears grinding and clanking)</i>

17:55.106 --> 17:56.373
Not anymore.

17:56.373 --> 17:58.142
Hilda, I've been trying
to find the right time

17:58.142 --> 17:59.210
to tell you something

17:59.210 --> 18:01.946
but maybe I should just,
uh, spit it out.

18:01.946 --> 18:02.747
Spit all you want.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.815
Just don't fog up
the windshield.

18:04.815 --> 18:06.884
The truth is I'm married.

18:06.884 --> 18:08.486
Want to see me
do a donut?

18:08.486 --> 18:09.954
HILDA:
Yoo-hoo!

18:09.954 --> 18:12.990
Well, you've taken this
better than I thought.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.525
But you have nothing
to worry about.

18:14.525 --> 18:15.726
I'm getting a divorce.

18:15.726 --> 18:18.028
That just stinks.

18:18.028 --> 18:19.163
I thought you'd be happy.

18:19.163 --> 18:20.464
The Pluto Highway
is closed.

18:20.464 --> 18:21.999
How am I supposed to
open up this puppy

18:21.999 --> 18:24.401
if I have to take
surface streets?

18:24.401 --> 18:25.936
Hilda, I am trying
to talk about us.

18:25.936 --> 18:27.104
Are you listening
to anything I'm saying?

18:27.104 --> 18:28.272
Of course I'm
listening.

18:28.272 --> 18:31.041
( <i>horn honking</i> )
Way to signal,
Dipwad!

18:31.041 --> 18:31.742
Well the good news is

18:31.742 --> 18:33.778
that I'm coming out
of this marriage in great shape.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.446
I get the house
and everything in it.

18:35.446 --> 18:37.214
All she gets is this car.

18:37.214 --> 18:38.983
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

18:39.583 --> 18:41.085
Sabrina, seeing
that spaceship

18:41.085 --> 18:42.887
confirms everything
I've ever believed in.

18:42.887 --> 18:44.388
And I know
I'm not deluding myself

18:44.388 --> 18:47.024
because you saw it, too...
right?

18:47.024 --> 18:48.526
Of course.

18:48.526 --> 18:49.894
I can't wait
to tell Professor Hutchins

18:49.894 --> 18:51.262
and this time
I have a witness.

18:51.262 --> 18:54.064
Miles, maybe we better keep
this between the two of us.

18:54.064 --> 18:54.632
You know what they say:

18:54.632 --> 18:57.234
"Double your sighting,
double your scorn."

18:57.234 --> 18:58.402
Perhaps you're right.

18:58.402 --> 18:59.904
And all that really matters

18:59.904 --> 19:02.273
is that someone else in the
world knows I'm not crazy.

19:02.273 --> 19:04.008
As long as you don't
go into accounting.

19:04.008 --> 19:05.209
I could never do that.

19:05.209 --> 19:07.645
My passion for the paranormal
is too strong.

19:07.645 --> 19:08.879
I'm glad to hear
you say that.

19:08.879 --> 19:10.047
So, you ready
to go inside?

19:10.047 --> 19:12.149
Not yet.

19:12.149 --> 19:13.584
Remember the other day,
when you said

19:13.584 --> 19:16.086
you were different
from everybody else?

19:16.086 --> 19:17.254
Did I say that?

19:17.254 --> 19:18.556
I was probably just trying
to make you feel better.

19:18.556 --> 19:21.559
No, Sabrina...

19:21.559 --> 19:24.028
I finally figured out
how you're different.

19:24.028 --> 19:25.162
I mean I was shocked at first

19:25.162 --> 19:27.765
but then I realized
all the clues were there

19:27.765 --> 19:29.099
from the very beginning.

19:29.099 --> 19:30.901
Miles, you've got to promise
not to tell anyone.

19:30.901 --> 19:32.703
Okay, you could really put my
life in jeopardy.

19:32.703 --> 19:34.305
Don't worry, Sabrina.

19:34.305 --> 19:35.239
I'm not going to tell everybody

19:35.239 --> 19:37.675
that you have a crush on me.

19:37.675 --> 19:38.642
I have a crush on you?

19:38.642 --> 19:40.277
Oh... yeah.

19:40.277 --> 19:41.745
I have a crush on you.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.047
Big time.

19:43.047 --> 19:45.749
But as long as we are roommates,
we must never act upon it.

19:45.749 --> 19:46.851
I understand.

19:46.851 --> 19:50.187
I'll do whatever I can
to be a little less desirable.

19:50.187 --> 19:51.589
It's working already.

19:52.857 --> 19:54.124
Oy!

19:54.692 --> 19:56.193
What a great word.

20:00.431 --> 20:01.198
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

20:02.333 --> 20:03.334
Hello.

20:03.334 --> 20:05.236
Oh, good it's you.

20:05.236 --> 20:06.070
I just want you to know

20:06.070 --> 20:07.271
that I'm contacting the FBI.

20:07.271 --> 20:07.972
They're going to track you down.

20:07.972 --> 20:10.274
You're going to be sorry
you ever dialed this number.

20:10.274 --> 20:11.909
Sabrina?

20:11.909 --> 20:13.510
Harvey?

20:13.510 --> 20:15.212
You're the one who's been
calling here and hanging up?

20:15.212 --> 20:16.513
Sorry about that.

20:16.513 --> 20:19.550
Every time I heard your voice,
I froze up.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.886
Well, I'm glad you finally
thawed out.

20:21.886 --> 20:23.087
Look, ever since I saw you

20:23.087 --> 20:24.889
in Florida,
you've been on my mind.

20:24.889 --> 20:27.258
I really feel bad
about the way I acted

20:27.258 --> 20:28.726
after I found out you were a...

20:28.726 --> 20:29.727
A witch?

20:29.727 --> 20:30.895
Yeah, that.

20:30.895 --> 20:33.097
But in my defense,
you did turn me into a frog

20:33.097 --> 20:35.432
and a beast
and a Canadian Mountie.

20:35.432 --> 20:37.534
Don't forget about
the time I made you pregnant.

20:37.534 --> 20:40.537
How can I?
I still have stretch marks.

20:40.537 --> 20:42.172
No, but even considering
all that...

20:42.172 --> 20:44.174
you've always been
a really good friend to me

20:44.174 --> 20:47.845
and the reason I'm calling
is that I want to apologize.

20:47.845 --> 20:48.712
Thanks.

20:48.712 --> 20:50.681
That really means
a lot to me.

20:50.681 --> 20:53.717
Yeah, well, that's pretty much
what I called to say

20:53.717 --> 20:56.720
and now I've pretty much
said it, so...

20:56.720 --> 20:59.223
Hey, is that a Cadillac
flying through the sky?

20:59.223 --> 21:00.491
I'm going to kill Aunt Hilda.
