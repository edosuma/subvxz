00:31.292 --> 00:34.164
- "What you doing, Chris?"

00:34.208 --> 00:36.688
He says he's "just chilling."

00:36.732 --> 00:38.473
- Send him a pic.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.170
- Mm?

00:40.214 --> 00:42.216
- Nah, not that one.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.655
Yeah, now you talking.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.396
- "I need you.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.789
Now a good time
to come over?"

00:53.140 --> 00:55.620
He says yes.
- Now me.

00:56.882 --> 00:59.320
Yes, send it.
- Ooh!

00:59.363 --> 01:02.323
- "Your bro home?
He want some too?"

01:02.366 --> 01:04.107
- Oh, that's good.
- Okay, okay.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.329
- 299 Madison Street.

01:08.372 --> 01:11.332
- Good job.
Go.

- Yo, that is fire.
- Wait, it's not done yet.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.752
- That's your OCD kicking in.
-

01:40.796 --> 01:42.189
- It's ready.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.452
- You sure?
- Hell yeah.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.326
- Chris is coming.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.154
Girls are here.
We'll post it later.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.287
You know,
I gotta be minty fresh.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.247
- Hey, Tori.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.164
- Uh-oh,
caught you slipping, man.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.861
Stash and cash, now.
- Stop scaring my brother!

02:02.905 --> 02:04.863
- Just do what he says.
- Do what I say.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.169
- Hey!
- No!

02:06.213 --> 02:08.650
No!

02:08.693 --> 02:10.521
-
- Do what I say, boy.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.175
- No!

02:12.219 --> 02:13.698
- Boy, get up!
You wanna live?

02:13.742 --> 02:15.178
Take me to the safe.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.788
Take me, go, open it up.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.399
Come on, open it up.
-

02:18.442 --> 02:19.530
- Come on, let's go!
- The safe.

02:19.574 --> 02:20.923
All right, get it open.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.359
- Boy, you better hurry up.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.318
- Get it open, let's go.
Let's go.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.362
- Put the money in the bag.
- Pick it up.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.407
Come on.
- All right, let's go.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.279
Let's go, get out.
Get out.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.597
Come on.
We gotta go.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.251
- No.
- Let's go!

02:44.294 --> 02:45.904
- No!
Wait, come back.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.819
Jasmine!
- Jas, come on now!

02:47.863 --> 02:49.299
Let's go!
- Don't leave me here!

02:49.343 --> 02:52.215
- Jas!
- No, Jasmine!

03:02.269 --> 03:03.400
- What is going on?

03:03.444 --> 03:05.010
- Carisi's first case
as riding DA.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.491
He caught that triple homicide
in Alphabet City last night.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.797
- What does this have
to do with SVU?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.102
- He just wanted us
to meet him here.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.235
- All right. Carisi.
- Hey, thanks for coming.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.932
The perps are in the wind,
except for an accomplice

03:13.976 --> 03:15.673
who got shot in the leg,
left behind at the scene.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.936
But she's refusing to talk.
- She?

03:17.980 --> 03:20.591
- Yeah.
Tori Warshofsky, 17.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.027
There was a surviving vic.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.638
Chris Miller says
that she was the honey trap

03:23.681 --> 03:24.987
that got the shooters inside.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.467
- Did he ID the shooters?

03:26.510 --> 03:28.425
- Chris claims he knew Tori,
not the other girl there.

03:28.469 --> 03:29.948
And the rest were in masks.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.689
They took him away to surgery
before I could get more.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.910
- So Tori's under arrest?
- Yes, and we need her to flip.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.259
- Shouldn't this be
on Homicide?

03:36.303 --> 03:37.478
- Yeah, it should.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.001
But the doctor found bruises
on her body.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.350
Some fresh, some old,

03:40.394 --> 03:42.526
like she's been systematically
beaten over time.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.267
Also, the blood tests revealed

03:44.311 --> 03:45.877
that she had
two different STDs.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.488
- So is she a suspect
or a victim?

03:47.531 --> 03:49.141
- I don't know.
