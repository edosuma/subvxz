<i>2015, CAMBODIA</i>

02:23.834 --> 02:25.584
Dr. HAN! We gotta go!

02:25.667 --> 02:26.292
Bye!

02:26.376 --> 02:27.251
Bye!

02:44.334 --> 02:48.959
The next flight will be in
2 weeks 'cuz of the flood!

02:49.042 --> 02:50.084
Let's go.

02:53.501 --> 02:55.376
You're booked up back home.

02:57.501 --> 03:01.251
This is the last helicopter.

03:05.501 --> 03:07.292
Soo-hyun!

03:07.376 --> 03:08.542
Give me the bag!

03:08.626 --> 03:12.167
- Go home. I'll call you.
- What are you doing?

03:13.292 --> 03:14.334
Come back!

03:15.334 --> 03:16.709
Soo-hyun!

04:11.251 --> 04:13.459
Thank you.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.000
Thank you.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.334
You see things better than most.

04:24.876 --> 04:31.542
I trust the things unseen
more than the seen.

04:33.834 --> 04:35.667
Is Lunan your granddaughter?

04:35.751 --> 04:41.376
I found her in the forest. Cleft
lip babies are thought cursed.

04:42.042 --> 04:44.251
You saved her life.

04:45.042 --> 04:50.751
You gave her a new life. I
thank you on behalf of Lunan.

04:51.042 --> 04:53.209
I just did what I should.

04:58.876 --> 05:04.501
Is there anything you
dearly wish for in life?

05:07.376 --> 05:08.959
Dearly wish for?

05:17.376 --> 05:21.251
There's someone I'm dying to see.

05:25.251 --> 05:27.751
You don't have much time.

05:39.417 --> 05:44.376
Life is what happens when you can't sleep.

05:58.751 --> 06:04.584
WILL YOU BE THERE?

06:04.917 --> 06:09.001
<i>Summer, Autumn, Winter, Mingky! Jump!</i>

06:15.667 --> 06:18.584
<i>The Moonwalk!</i>

06:26.334 --> 06:28.501
<i>Mingky's spiral jump!</i>

06:29.501 --> 06:31.584
<i>Big applause, please!</i>

06:34.709 --> 06:38.917
<i>Seoul Grand Park introduces...</i>

06:39.001 --> 06:42.251

06:42.834 --> 06:46.917
<i>CHOI Yeon-a!</i>

06:57.334 --> 06:58.626
Had a nice nap?

07:00.126 --> 07:01.167
Enjoyed it?

07:01.251 --> 07:03.584
So fun. I lost track of time.

07:03.626 --> 07:04.834
I see.

07:06.584 --> 07:07.792
Yeon-a!

07:07.876 --> 07:12.209
I worked last night. I'll
watch it all next time.

07:12.292 --> 07:15.459
When? After I die?

07:15.542 --> 07:18.084
How can you say that?

07:19.542 --> 07:20.792
Yeon-a!

07:21.417 --> 07:22.834
Are you mad?

07:24.667 --> 07:25.792
CHOI Yeon-a!

07:27.001 --> 07:28.209
Yeon-a!

07:41.501 --> 07:42.501
Let me see.

07:42.584 --> 07:44.542
It's from before. I'm fine.

07:44.626 --> 07:46.626
When did you get hurt?

07:46.917 --> 07:48.334
I fell 'cuz of you!

07:48.376 --> 07:49.751
Why you!

07:49.792 --> 07:53.501
A doctor shouldn't hurt his hand.

07:54.209 --> 07:55.334
Yeon-a.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.792
How long were we apart?

07:57.876 --> 07:58.876
1 minute.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.459
That long?

08:01.751 --> 08:03.042
Kiss me.

08:07.376 --> 08:09.417
Why here? 'Cuz of people?

08:09.501 --> 08:11.001
They're watching!

08:12.376 --> 08:15.584
- I missed you.
- Me too.

08:30.792 --> 08:31.917
Yeon-a!

08:33.126 --> 08:34.708
You're still here!

08:34.792 --> 08:36.667
What about your show?

08:38.001 --> 08:41.083
I forgot to say something important.

08:41.167 --> 08:42.208
What?

08:42.292 --> 08:45.917
<i>Passengers on the 5:30 train to Busan...</i>

08:46.334 --> 08:48.042
Let's talk on the way.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.417
Let's go.

08:50.501 --> 08:52.459
Just tell me?

08:53.959 --> 08:55.584
Is something wrong?

08:56.792 --> 09:01.626
Male dolphins cannot mate on its own.

09:01.709 --> 09:06.251
So other males help him
to mate with the female.

09:06.334 --> 09:07.542
I think...

09:08.376 --> 09:11.292
You're like the male dolphin.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.084
What do you mean?

09:13.167 --> 09:15.542
You need help from others.

09:16.001 --> 09:18.417
<i>The train to Busan will soon depart.</i>

09:18.501 --> 09:20.251
I want to have your baby.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.667
I want your baby!

09:27.834 --> 09:30.917
- So assertive!
- I want a baby too!

09:31.001 --> 09:33.751
What are you saying? Have a baby here?

09:37.667 --> 09:39.542
I'll call when I arrive.

09:40.751 --> 09:42.667
Take good care.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.292
Bye.

09:54.626 --> 09:57.917
- Looks like it didn't go well.
- It did.

09:58.001 --> 10:00.084
He wants to get married?

10:00.167 --> 10:01.417
Of course.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.126
Good!

10:11.042 --> 10:13.126
Dept. Of Marine Animals.

10:17.126 --> 10:18.959
Ecological report?

10:19.042 --> 10:20.584
I'll send it.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.459
What's this?

10:33.792 --> 10:37.876
Kids asked to have it
raised with its friends.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.042
Kids watch too many cartoons.

10:40.584 --> 10:41.584
So cute.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.876
This is no daycare.

10:44.834 --> 10:48.084
BUSAN STATION

11:38.126 --> 11:39.334
Are you okay?

11:39.834 --> 11:41.584
- Are you alright, sir?
- Yes.

11:44.001 --> 11:45.042
Where am I?

11:45.126 --> 11:48.667
Busan Station. Sure you're okay?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.167
Busan Station?

11:58.209 --> 11:59.626
Who are you?

12:01.667 --> 12:03.376
Just trying to help...

12:05.959 --> 12:07.501
What's your name?

12:10.126 --> 12:11.542
I'm HAN Soo-hyun.

12:14.084 --> 12:15.917
But that's my name...

12:20.251 --> 12:21.709
Hey! Wait!

12:37.126 --> 12:38.167
Sir!

12:39.126 --> 12:40.751
Are you okay?

12:41.584 --> 12:44.084
Are you alright?

13:16.209 --> 13:17.167
Shit.

13:18.876 --> 13:20.209
Sir!

13:32.167 --> 13:33.959
Are you okay, sir?

13:35.417 --> 13:37.751
I need my handkerchief back.

13:40.001 --> 13:40.792
Sir?

13:40.876 --> 13:46.334
<i>Life is what happens when you can't sleep.</i>

13:47.376 --> 13:48.751
Sir!

13:51.876 --> 13:53.251
Sir?

13:54.459 --> 13:56.001
Are you in there?

14:03.251 --> 14:05.251
Are you alright, sir?

14:07.626 --> 14:08.626
Sir?

14:08.709 --> 14:09.834
Wait, please.

14:12.251 --> 14:13.959
Are you okay, sir?

14:14.042 --> 14:15.042
Yes.

14:15.376 --> 14:18.292
You were in there long. We were worried.

14:18.376 --> 14:19.834
I'm sorry.

14:23.167 --> 14:24.376
Excuse me.

15:04.084 --> 15:04.751
Hi.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.126
Busy?

15:06.209 --> 15:07.167
What's up?

15:07.251 --> 15:10.417
Just stopped by to see
if you got back okay.

15:10.501 --> 15:11.917
I had a good time.

15:12.292 --> 15:14.126
No trouble without me?

15:14.167 --> 15:17.542
You're one to talk. You caused havoc here!

15:17.626 --> 15:20.584
We were busy covering your
surgeries and lectures!

15:20.667 --> 15:22.501
Always thankful.

15:22.792 --> 15:25.334
Then buy me dinner?

15:25.834 --> 15:26.751
Why not?

15:27.459 --> 15:28.751
What is it?

15:29.834 --> 15:31.376
Another surgery?

15:31.459 --> 15:33.042
How much time left?

15:33.667 --> 15:35.876
The tumor is over 5cm.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.376
Looks like it spread to the liver too.

15:39.167 --> 15:41.917
It's terminal lung cancer.
I give it 6 months.

15:42.334 --> 15:44.084
If it was a friend, what would you say?

15:44.167 --> 15:45.584
What's to say?

15:46.084 --> 15:49.834
I'd just help prepare him to die well.

15:49.917 --> 15:52.167
- I thought so.
- Who is it?

15:52.876 --> 15:54.167
Your bosom buddy?

15:54.251 --> 15:55.292
Tae-ho?

15:57.042 --> 15:59.584
He'll outlive us by 50 years.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.084
Oh no! He'll flip!

16:02.167 --> 16:04.917
Sorry! I gotta go.

16:05.167 --> 16:10.626
Running away again? No date, huh?

16:10.751 --> 16:12.376
I promise next time.

16:12.417 --> 16:13.751
Hold on!

16:14.292 --> 16:18.042
Could you get this analyzed?

16:18.126 --> 16:19.667
What is it?

16:22.917 --> 16:26.876
Crazy? What if the blind
gramps gave you something bad?

16:26.959 --> 16:30.459
What doctor takes strange pills like that?

16:30.542 --> 16:33.084
- It was so real.
- It's a hallucinogen.

16:33.584 --> 16:36.334
Like the pills people take
before bungee jumping.

16:37.584 --> 16:38.876
Whatever.

16:40.042 --> 16:44.292
All you do is work 24/7,
you must've gone crazy!

16:45.084 --> 16:46.501
How was it?

16:46.584 --> 16:48.209
Seeing yourself then?

16:49.917 --> 16:51.959
Good looking and young.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.459
Why you!

16:55.501 --> 17:02.917
This beach was hot back then
filled with pretty gals!

17:04.626 --> 17:09.959
They loved me! Wonder how they're living.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.666
JOO-Hong was hot.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.291
And Mi-sun.

17:16.501 --> 17:19.584
- But not Choon-Nam.
- You remember their names?

17:20.209 --> 17:25.584
If you meet him again,
tell him to get married.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.376
A smelly bachelor your whole life...

17:28.459 --> 17:29.834
If I go back...

17:35.501 --> 17:37.167
Think I can see her?

17:38.001 --> 17:39.292
Yeon-a.

17:40.751 --> 17:42.209
You serious?

17:43.042 --> 17:44.792
Get over it.

17:46.209 --> 17:48.292
It's been over 30 years.

17:49.709 --> 17:55.042
If you can meet her at
will, it'd be a miracle!

17:55.126 --> 17:56.501
Crazy fool.

17:56.584 --> 17:59.292
Lady! I'll get it!

17:59.376 --> 18:00.917
Oh yes!

18:05.667 --> 18:07.167
Crazy!

18:08.084 --> 18:09.209
Nice!

18:09.292 --> 18:10.209
Tae-ho!

18:10.292 --> 18:12.834
What's so important to call me out here?

18:12.917 --> 18:14.001
Catch.

18:15.376 --> 18:16.626
What's this?

18:16.709 --> 18:18.709
I'll move to Jeju to farm this.

18:19.626 --> 18:21.251
Why's a tangerine so big?

18:21.334 --> 18:22.376
Cool, huh?

18:22.459 --> 18:27.876
It's a Japanese Dekopon. A
mix of tangerine and orange.

18:28.209 --> 18:31.626
If I import and grow this,
I'll hit the jackpot.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.709
I even made a name for it.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.584
Orange-tangerine!

18:35.667 --> 18:38.334
Just stick to your job, pal.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.334
Did something happen in Seoul?

18:49.334 --> 18:51.542
Yeon-a wants to have a baby.

18:51.626 --> 18:52.959
All of a sudden?

18:54.542 --> 18:55.876
Lucky fool.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.417
Yeon-a is great!

18:57.501 --> 19:02.876
Rather than wait for you, she'll
throw you on the bed first?

19:05.417 --> 19:06.792
Lucky you.

19:06.876 --> 19:08.834
7 years is a long time to wait.

19:08.917 --> 19:09.876
Congratulations man!

19:09.959 --> 19:12.959
I don't plan on having any kids.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.292
I decided that long ago.

19:16.084 --> 19:19.542
If I was a girl, I'd marry you too.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.459
- You'll marry me?
- Sure.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.376
- Crazy!
- Why not!

19:26.834 --> 19:28.292
By the way...

19:28.917 --> 19:31.501
- I met someone strange last night.
- Pretty?

19:31.584 --> 19:33.126
- A man.
- Not interested.

19:33.834 --> 19:36.251
He seemed familiar for some reason.

19:36.334 --> 19:39.084
Probably a patient.

19:39.167 --> 19:42.167
Then I'd remember. His name's the same.

19:42.251 --> 19:44.292
Asked my name then said he's HAN Soo-hyun.

19:44.376 --> 19:46.459
He must be a psycho.

19:46.542 --> 19:49.417
His nose bled badly so I
followed him to the bathroom.

19:49.501 --> 19:51.667
- And?
- He disappeared.

19:52.084 --> 19:54.917
- Some magician?
- Really! He vanished!

19:55.042 --> 19:57.334
Must've seen it wrong.

19:57.417 --> 19:58.751
Must've, right?

19:59.584 --> 20:01.584
- I'm off.
- Soo-hyun!

20:01.667 --> 20:02.292
What?

20:02.376 --> 20:07.417
That gal with big boobs
keeps looking at me.

20:07.501 --> 20:11.334
She's sending me signals. See her winking?

20:11.417 --> 20:13.459
Then I should wink back!

20:13.542 --> 20:16.834
How do I look? Should I go to her?

20:16.917 --> 20:18.209
- Tae-ho?
- What?

20:18.292 --> 20:21.084
That Orangerine you talked about...

20:21.167 --> 20:23.209
Do it. It'll work.

20:23.792 --> 20:26.209
Orangerine?

20:26.626 --> 20:28.542
You're a genius!

20:52.084 --> 20:53.542
<i>SOO-A</i>

20:56.667 --> 20:58.751
- My girl!
- <i>Hi, Dad!</i>

20:58.834 --> 21:00.834
It's been ages. Where are you?

21:00.917 --> 21:03.126
<i>The library. Is something wrong?</i>

21:03.126 --> 21:07.084
Of course not. Just wanted to talk to you.

21:07.126 --> 21:08.292
<i>About what?</i>

21:08.376 --> 21:09.584
Why you!

21:10.209 --> 21:12.376
Are you eating right?

21:12.667 --> 21:14.501
<i>Of course! And you?</i>

21:14.792 --> 21:17.792
Daddy eats well.

21:17.876 --> 21:20.376
<i>Don't skip meals 'cuz I'm not there!</i>

21:21.792 --> 21:24.167
I hear a man's voice.

21:24.251 --> 21:26.459
Where the hell are you?

21:26.751 --> 21:30.584
<i>What's with you? Hang up
if you're going to nag.</i>

21:34.501 --> 21:36.209
<i>Caught a cold?</i>

21:36.876 --> 21:38.876
Something's in my throat.

21:39.042 --> 21:42.959
<i>I'll be home soon after my exams.</i>

21:43.042 --> 21:44.501
<i>Let's talk in person.</i>

21:44.584 --> 21:46.126
See you then.

22:21.042 --> 22:22.459
Nine left.

22:26.542 --> 22:28.251
I'll die soon anyway.

22:55.501 --> 22:57.542
- Geeze!
- Oh my!

22:58.792 --> 23:00.626
- Why'd you come?
- Here.

23:00.709 --> 23:01.501
What's this?

23:01.584 --> 23:04.084
Let's start building one by one.

23:05.001 --> 23:06.917
You came down here for this?

23:07.001 --> 23:08.959
Cute, huh? Our family!

23:09.042 --> 23:10.584
I've never raised a dog.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.001
It's okay.

23:12.251 --> 23:13.751
I gotta catch my train.

23:13.834 --> 23:14.917
You're leaving?

23:15.001 --> 23:17.751
I don't want to, but I got a morning show.

23:17.834 --> 23:19.084
Don't go.

23:19.167 --> 23:20.751
You two get along.

23:20.834 --> 23:21.501
Take care.

23:21.584 --> 23:23.292
I've never raised a puppy!

23:23.376 --> 23:24.959
You're really leaving?

23:25.042 --> 23:27.209
- Busan Station, please.
- I can't raise a dog.

23:27.209 --> 23:29.667
Animals and people are the same.

23:29.751 --> 23:32.376
Watch carefully and you'll
know what they want.

23:32.459 --> 23:33.501
Don't go.

23:33.917 --> 23:37.251
<i>POTATOES</i>

23:37.584 --> 23:41.334
What now? This is nuts.

23:43.209 --> 23:46.667
Your name's Potato from now on.

23:46.917 --> 23:48.084
Eat this.

24:05.084 --> 24:06.417
Let's sleep.

24:37.417 --> 24:40.167
I made it? I'm here?

24:40.251 --> 24:42.459
Who's there?

24:45.751 --> 24:47.667
There's nothing to take so...

24:56.042 --> 24:58.042
May 30th, 1985?

24:59.209 --> 25:00.417
Exactly 30 years.

25:00.501 --> 25:04.209
You're the man from Busan Station, right?

25:04.292 --> 25:07.334
Clean up! You moved in long ago.

25:07.417 --> 25:10.001
How'd you come to my house?

25:11.042 --> 25:12.084
Cuz it's my house too.

25:12.167 --> 25:17.459
Don't touch anything! Get the hell out now!

25:17.542 --> 25:20.126
You still don't know who I am?

25:20.209 --> 25:22.001
How would I know?

25:24.042 --> 25:25.334
Are you a patient?

25:25.417 --> 25:28.542
Not a patient but a pediatric surgeon.

25:30.084 --> 25:32.876
I'm a pediatric surgery resident.

25:34.876 --> 25:38.417
Must be a psychiatric patient.
What's your name?

25:38.501 --> 25:41.126
I told you it's HAN Soo-hyun.

25:41.626 --> 25:43.251
This is insane!

25:43.667 --> 25:48.334
Give me your ID. I'll call to get you help.

25:52.626 --> 25:53.501
HAN SOO-HYUN

25:53.584 --> 25:55.251
Haven't seen this TV in so long!

25:56.834 --> 25:58.001
Sir?

25:58.751 --> 25:59.834
Here.

26:01.126 --> 26:03.959
What kind of joke is this?

26:04.542 --> 26:07.876
Come on! Issued in year 2008?

26:07.917 --> 26:10.167
Potato? It's you!

26:11.209 --> 26:15.084
Long time no see Potato!

26:21.667 --> 26:23.084
How do you know its name?

26:24.584 --> 26:26.209
Cuz I named him.

26:28.959 --> 26:33.542
I know it's hard to believe.
To be honest, I still don't.

26:34.417 --> 26:37.501
But you're me 30 years ago
and I'm you 30 years later.

26:38.917 --> 26:40.917
That makes no sense.

26:41.001 --> 26:43.542
Makes sense I vanished from that bathroom?

26:54.417 --> 26:55.834
What the hell!

26:56.084 --> 26:57.959
- Want a taste from the future?
- No!

26:58.042 --> 27:00.042
If you don't leave, I'll call the cops.

27:00.084 --> 27:02.876
The cops? You mean Tae-ho?

27:06.084 --> 27:09.542
You can't believe this. I understand.

27:10.376 --> 27:12.792
We're all believers in science.

27:13.792 --> 27:19.209
But as you get older, the belief fades.

27:19.292 --> 27:20.501
Please just leave now.

27:20.584 --> 27:22.876
Will you believe if I say
a secret only we know?

27:22.959 --> 27:24.417
What secret?

27:25.876 --> 27:27.709
I don't have any secrets, sir.

27:27.792 --> 27:29.167
There's one.

27:30.042 --> 27:32.292
A secret we didn't tell anyone.

27:32.376 --> 27:33.542
What?

27:40.001 --> 27:41.959
We got beaten by Dad a lot.

27:42.501 --> 27:44.084
When he got drunk.

27:44.126 --> 27:47.084
Thought hiding it was helping Mom.

27:50.751 --> 27:54.334
You're scared to get hurt like that again.

27:55.042 --> 27:56.917
- Or to hurt others.
- Shut up!

27:57.667 --> 28:00.792
Why'd you move to Busan as
soon as Mom passed away?

28:00.876 --> 28:02.709
You wanted to forget.

28:03.501 --> 28:07.167
But think about who
helped you forget it all.

28:09.084 --> 28:10.417
Who are you?

28:13.209 --> 28:13.959
HAN Soo-hyun.

28:14.042 --> 28:16.126
What do you want from me?

28:18.709 --> 28:19.876
Nothing.

28:20.542 --> 28:22.501
Just want to see her once.

28:23.084 --> 28:24.459
Yeon-a.

28:24.542 --> 28:26.334
What the hell do you mean?

28:29.001 --> 28:30.334
Come back!

28:45.376 --> 28:47.792
Stay the hell away from Yeon-a!

28:48.584 --> 28:50.042
Or I'll kill you!

29:27.709 --> 29:29.626
Tae-ho! Open up!

29:29.709 --> 29:30.501
It's Soo-hyun!

29:30.584 --> 29:31.792
What is it?

29:32.376 --> 29:35.167
Hey, wait!

29:35.251 --> 29:36.917
Listen to me.

29:37.001 --> 29:39.084
Are you sick?

29:42.417 --> 29:43.667
It's totally unimaginable!

29:43.751 --> 29:46.126
Can't you see what I'm doing?

29:46.209 --> 29:47.542
Honey?

29:47.626 --> 29:49.042
Who is it?

29:49.126 --> 29:51.959
Don't mind him, baby! I'll send him off!

29:52.042 --> 29:53.917
- Go home.
- Busan Station!

29:55.334 --> 29:56.542
That man appeared again!

29:56.626 --> 29:58.126
The psycho? See ya.

29:58.209 --> 30:00.126
He barged into my house.

30:00.209 --> 30:02.126
He says he's me 30 years later!

30:02.209 --> 30:04.792
Okay, man. Let's talk tomorrow!

30:04.876 --> 30:06.501
He even knows...

30:08.209 --> 30:10.917
He knows that you're a cop.

30:11.876 --> 30:16.876
He said he'll meet Yeon-a, then vanished!

30:18.542 --> 30:20.042
12 o'clock...

30:23.376 --> 30:24.667
20 minutes.

30:26.209 --> 30:29.834
I stayed there 20 minutes.

30:41.834 --> 30:44.376
Fingerprint matching is not easy.

30:44.459 --> 30:47.792
TV shows make it look
way easier than it is.

30:47.876 --> 30:50.167
Then compare it with my fingerprints.

30:50.251 --> 30:51.584
You don't believe him do you?

30:51.667 --> 30:54.584
It says it was made in 2000.

30:54.667 --> 30:55.709
That's weird.

30:55.792 --> 30:58.334
No, that's the price! 2,000 Won!

30:58.417 --> 31:00.001
Wait!

31:00.334 --> 31:02.042
It's all filled out.

31:02.126 --> 31:03.584
Thank you.

31:06.542 --> 31:10.084
Worried about your girl, you
drag me out at this hour!

31:10.167 --> 31:13.209
But I was with Sun-young!

31:13.292 --> 31:15.376
Things were good.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.709
Did you call Yeon-a?

31:20.584 --> 31:21.542
Yeon-a...

31:21.626 --> 31:24.167
Can't use the phone here.

31:24.251 --> 31:27.459
Don't worry! It's just a crazy man's scam.

31:27.959 --> 31:30.001
I'll get you some water.

31:34.626 --> 31:35.501
<i>Dr. HAN?</i>

31:35.584 --> 31:36.292
Yes.

31:36.376 --> 31:40.417
<i>I got the results on the pill.
It's just a blend of plants.</i>

31:40.626 --> 31:41.459
Really?

31:41.542 --> 31:44.501
<i>It's made of mulberry and quince leaves.</i>

31:44.584 --> 31:47.209
<i>Looks like a placebo.</i>

31:47.584 --> 31:49.042
Of course.

31:49.126 --> 31:50.876
<i>But where'd you get it?</i>

31:51.542 --> 31:54.959
It's nothing. Thanks a lot.

32:05.584 --> 32:08.584
Call me if anything happens. Okay?

32:08.667 --> 32:11.126
- <i>Okay. I'll call you.</i>
- Bye.

32:13.501 --> 32:15.001
Got the results?

32:15.084 --> 32:17.209
Brace yourself and listen.

32:17.959 --> 32:21.251
This lighter only has your fingerprints.

32:21.334 --> 32:22.042
Serious?

32:22.334 --> 32:24.084
Of course I am!

32:25.542 --> 32:28.584
What's the chance of two
people's fingerprints...

32:28.667 --> 32:30.167
What am I saying?

32:30.251 --> 32:31.042
The chance?

32:31.126 --> 32:36.042
About as much as farting
1,500 times at once.

32:37.626 --> 32:39.126
Watch it!

32:39.209 --> 32:40.876
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry up!

32:40.959 --> 32:42.167
I'm going!

32:43.084 --> 32:44.709
Move it!

32:49.501 --> 32:50.876
Where was it?

32:50.959 --> 32:52.292
Here.

32:52.376 --> 32:53.584
Relax.

33:03.251 --> 33:05.959
Children need batteries
replaced more often.

33:06.042 --> 33:08.751
Beware of loose wires as they grow.

33:09.292 --> 33:12.834
Dr. HAN? Why is another doctor
doing the surgery tomorrow?

33:12.917 --> 33:17.084
He's a better expert in hearts.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.709
But why? You're her doctor.

33:19.792 --> 33:22.751
Can't you change the dates and do it?

33:23.417 --> 33:27.334
Don't worry. I'll ask him to...

33:27.417 --> 33:29.001
He'll do well.

33:43.001 --> 33:44.709
<i>PLEASE VISIT</i>

33:44.792 --> 33:46.751
Please visit?

33:51.334 --> 33:53.251
Pretty clever.

34:04.584 --> 34:05.626
Stop!

34:06.376 --> 34:08.042
Stop!

34:08.126 --> 34:08.917
Wait!

34:21.001 --> 34:23.292
Fool! Get moving!

34:32.751 --> 34:35.251
<i>PLEASE VISIT</i>

34:39.583 --> 34:41.376
Damn it.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.876
Forget it.

35:00.792 --> 35:01.917
Yes!

35:06.959 --> 35:08.459
Good...

35:15.459 --> 35:17.251
Hi, Soo-a!

35:17.334 --> 35:20.042
I'm sorry. I'm on my way.

35:21.584 --> 35:23.376
Sorry I'm late again.

35:23.584 --> 35:25.209
Busy as always.

35:25.751 --> 35:30.167
Speed up, Dad. Everyone's passing you.

35:30.251 --> 35:31.834
80km per hour zone.

35:31.917 --> 35:33.876
I'm going the right speed.

35:36.792 --> 35:39.542
Wanna take a trip? It's summer break.

35:40.167 --> 35:40.959
What about work?

35:41.042 --> 35:42.376
Doctors have vacations too.

35:42.417 --> 35:44.084
Could've fooled me.

35:44.126 --> 35:45.376
Why you...

35:45.459 --> 35:48.126
- Where should we go?
- Any ideas?

35:49.334 --> 35:51.126
Anywhere but the zoo.

35:52.334 --> 35:53.334
An aquarium.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.626
No way!

35:54.709 --> 35:57.459
I'm not going.

35:57.584 --> 35:59.167
An aquarium abroad?

36:00.626 --> 36:02.751
We've been to all of them.

36:07.376 --> 36:09.334
A dolphin, please. How much?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.709
800 won.

36:11.542 --> 36:12.376
Your change.

36:12.459 --> 36:15.709
- I'll take them all.
- Thank you!

36:22.084 --> 36:23.501
Yeon-a!

36:23.584 --> 36:24.834
CHOI Yeon-a!

36:27.334 --> 36:28.126
Wait there!

36:28.209 --> 36:30.209
Soo-hyun? What's that?

36:30.292 --> 36:31.667
Come on over.

36:35.584 --> 36:36.876
Soo-hyun!

36:38.459 --> 36:39.834
Are you okay?

36:40.334 --> 36:41.417
Wait!

36:45.376 --> 36:47.001
This wasn't it.

36:47.667 --> 36:48.834
What?

36:49.876 --> 36:51.542
Listen carefully.

36:58.292 --> 37:02.959
The Caspian tern gives
food to please its mate.

37:02.959 --> 37:08.376
Green frogs, white herons, and
zebra finches sing to please.

37:08.417 --> 37:10.126
You know I can't sing.

37:10.751 --> 37:14.876
♪ Nothing I can say... ♪

37:17.751 --> 37:20.626
I'm no better than those animals.

37:26.542 --> 37:28.501
So I brought these.

37:28.584 --> 37:30.042
I swear...

37:32.209 --> 37:35.001
I won't let go of your hand till I die.

37:40.209 --> 37:41.709
You know what?

37:46.126 --> 37:50.667
When elephants find their
mates, they go into the forest.

37:54.584 --> 37:56.542
- Hi, Mr. KIM!
- Hello.

37:56.626 --> 37:59.751
Lovely weather! Take care!

38:24.917 --> 38:26.126
Wait.

38:26.209 --> 38:28.001
Stop! It tickles!

38:28.959 --> 38:31.834
- Come on.
- It tickles.

38:34.876 --> 38:36.876
You're so beautiful.

38:40.001 --> 38:41.917
Trying to tame me?

38:52.792 --> 38:53.959
Wait.

38:54.834 --> 38:56.709
Many eyes are watching.

38:58.959 --> 39:01.001
They won't attack, right?

39:01.751 --> 39:03.209
Don't worry.

39:03.292 --> 39:05.917
You're with an expert trainer.

39:15.542 --> 39:16.959
Kid! Let's eat.

39:19.459 --> 39:20.792
Soo-a!

39:23.709 --> 39:24.792
What?

39:26.001 --> 39:27.792
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

39:30.084 --> 39:32.042
<i>MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS</i>

39:34.667 --> 39:36.667
- Like it?
- Yup.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.667
I came for your stew. That's all.

39:39.751 --> 39:40.792
Eat lots.

39:41.751 --> 39:43.084
You too.

39:44.209 --> 39:45.542
Hey, kid.

39:46.959 --> 39:49.292
How about studying in the States?

39:49.376 --> 39:52.167
No! I can't eat without Kimchi.

39:53.417 --> 39:57.084
There are great medical schools.

39:57.167 --> 39:58.209
And your mom's there.

39:58.292 --> 40:00.334
Why suddenly the States?

40:03.001 --> 40:04.959
- Soo-a...
- Something's fishy.

40:05.042 --> 40:07.376
Got a girlfriend now?

40:10.334 --> 40:12.626
Who? Is she pretty?

40:13.709 --> 40:15.584
Not a girlfriend...

40:16.417 --> 40:20.667
But I got something nasty.

40:24.292 --> 40:26.042
The stew's delicious.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.751
Maybe a bit salty.

40:32.792 --> 40:34.209
HAN Soo-a.

40:35.001 --> 40:36.792
Thanks for dinner.

40:55.042 --> 40:56.667
HAN Soo-a!

40:57.292 --> 40:59.334
Soo-a!

41:00.709 --> 41:02.376
HAN Soo-a!

41:04.834 --> 41:06.334
Soo-a!

41:13.709 --> 41:15.209
Soo-a!

41:24.292 --> 41:25.709
Meow!

41:29.626 --> 41:31.334
Meow!

41:36.834 --> 41:38.626
Aren't you cold?

41:44.584 --> 41:46.709
You're always late.

41:48.917 --> 41:50.292
I know.

41:51.084 --> 41:53.876
Uncle Tae-ho warns me all the time.

41:59.126 --> 42:00.917
But why...

42:35.251 --> 42:36.417
Here.

42:37.626 --> 42:40.084
Keep it. It's yours anyway.

42:40.834 --> 42:44.751
I'll keep this instead. It's mine anyway.

42:48.167 --> 42:49.876
You're me 30 years later?

42:49.959 --> 42:53.042
What's with this?

42:54.126 --> 42:56.167
Can't wear T-shirts now.

43:00.167 --> 43:02.334
How is this possible?

43:02.417 --> 43:05.334
Let's just call it a streak of luck.

43:05.417 --> 43:11.292
What's the world like in 2015?

43:11.376 --> 43:13.126
It's not much better.

43:15.876 --> 43:17.459
How's KIM Hyun-sik?

43:17.542 --> 43:18.876
The singer?

43:20.542 --> 43:22.959
He dies of liver cancer 5 years later.

43:23.417 --> 43:25.501
No cure for cancer even then?

43:26.834 --> 43:28.667
But technology is better.

43:28.751 --> 43:31.501
We can remove tumors without ventrotomy.

43:31.834 --> 43:34.751
Even without cutting the abdomen open?

43:35.709 --> 43:40.001
Still, there are new diseases and illness.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.292
I often think the simple past was better.

43:44.376 --> 43:48.501
Do I become a good doctor?

43:48.584 --> 43:50.292
You already are one.

43:50.584 --> 43:54.667
Insensitive to death and
knowing to keep a distance...

43:54.751 --> 43:56.042
I guess I become stronger.

43:56.084 --> 43:58.667
Your sensitivity made you a good doctor.

43:59.542 --> 44:01.834
<i>Hello everyone!</i>

44:03.292 --> 44:05.917
- Do I have kids?
- One daughter.

44:06.001 --> 44:09.126
<i>Welcome to the Dolphin Show!</i>

44:12.042 --> 44:14.959
Yeon-a must be a good mom.

44:17.751 --> 44:21.626
Why so curious? You'll
find out as you live.

44:21.709 --> 44:27.876
Korea's first female trainer, Ms.
CHOI Yeon-a!

44:30.876 --> 44:34.751
<i>Big applause, please!</i>

44:40.667 --> 44:42.376
<i>Hello!</i>

45:45.001 --> 45:47.001
<i>A big hand, please!</i>

45:49.126 --> 45:51.667
Are you sick somewhere?

45:52.834 --> 45:55.417
It's just time to go back.

45:55.917 --> 45:57.876
It's my last trip anyway.

46:00.959 --> 46:01.959
Wait!

46:03.917 --> 46:05.167
Hold on!

46:09.334 --> 46:11.626
Tell me about Yeon-a.

46:12.584 --> 46:14.126
Why'd you come?

46:14.209 --> 46:16.417
What's your real reason for coming?

46:16.501 --> 46:18.334
No reason. Just came to see Yeon-a.

46:18.376 --> 46:20.167
Isn't Yeon-a there in...

46:22.917 --> 46:24.584
Yeon-a isn't there?

46:24.667 --> 46:26.042
You'll find out.

46:27.084 --> 46:28.626
Answer me.

46:31.709 --> 46:33.792
Did something happen to her?

46:33.876 --> 46:34.834
You'll know later.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.834
Know what?

46:39.126 --> 46:41.084
Don't scare me.

46:41.167 --> 46:42.376
Tell me.

46:52.792 --> 46:54.542
Go to Yeon-a.

46:54.626 --> 46:56.459
Be good to her.

46:56.542 --> 46:58.251
Tell me everything.

46:59.209 --> 47:01.417
What happens to Yeon-a?

47:06.959 --> 47:08.751
Yeon-a will die soon.

47:12.251 --> 47:14.126
That's crazy.

47:15.876 --> 47:18.001
Why would Yeon-a die!

47:19.126 --> 47:21.084
She dies because of...

47:27.584 --> 47:31.501
Soo-hyun? Where are you?

47:33.042 --> 47:34.667
Soo-hyun!

47:41.834 --> 47:45.542
- What are you doing?
- Yeon-a...

48:16.001 --> 48:18.209
What am I doing?

48:29.542 --> 48:34.209
Why look at me while driving? Look ahead.

48:34.292 --> 48:37.167
Cuz you're pretty. Give me your hand.

48:39.334 --> 48:42.334
If I was any prettier, we'd be dead.

48:43.334 --> 48:45.834
- And...
- I'll keep the speed limit.

48:48.959 --> 48:51.251
How's the puppy I gave you?

48:51.334 --> 48:52.417
Potato?

48:52.501 --> 48:54.542
That's his name?

48:54.626 --> 48:57.834
It suits. Can't wait to see him.

49:01.584 --> 49:02.876
Sleep.

49:14.334 --> 49:17.001
Hold on. I gotta make a call.

49:21.751 --> 49:24.751
I brought you something
to apologize for before.

49:24.834 --> 49:27.542
Tada! Food!

49:27.626 --> 49:29.334
I made it myself.

49:30.334 --> 49:31.751
I said I'm on a diet.

49:31.834 --> 49:35.084
No, Sun-young! You're
as light as a feather.

49:35.167 --> 49:36.459
Open wide!

49:41.959 --> 49:43.251
I'm sorry.

49:45.501 --> 49:47.917
You want this instead?

49:48.001 --> 49:49.001
I'm good at this.

49:49.084 --> 49:51.001
- Do it right!
- Yes!

49:58.917 --> 50:00.251
- Mr. KANG Tae-ho?
- Yes.

50:00.334 --> 50:02.209
2 telegrams for you.

50:02.292 --> 50:03.834
At this hour?

50:03.917 --> 50:07.126
Said to read the top one first.

50:07.209 --> 50:10.167
Thank you very much.

50:10.792 --> 50:11.917
Goodnight.

50:14.834 --> 50:17.334
<i>Take the second telegram
and go to my house now.</i>

50:17.417 --> 50:19.376
What the hell?

50:23.417 --> 50:27.251
The criminal looks nasty...

50:31.292 --> 50:32.334
Look.

50:32.417 --> 50:34.834
If you leave now, we're through!

50:35.417 --> 50:36.501
I know...

50:38.959 --> 50:41.042
Die, you bastard!

50:41.126 --> 50:42.209
Bark! Bark!

50:44.417 --> 50:49.501
Your papa is a bastard.

50:50.792 --> 50:57.167
I could be hot and heavy
with Sun-young now.

50:57.917 --> 50:59.084
You know?

51:00.042 --> 51:03.126
You dissing me?

51:05.917 --> 51:09.292
I have a bad friend and you a bad papa.

51:12.501 --> 51:14.251
I did as you asked, pal.

51:16.251 --> 51:18.626
KIM Hyun-sik...

51:20.209 --> 51:23.834
The things I do for him...

51:23.876 --> 51:26.167
Ouch! It's working.

51:52.876 --> 51:53.959
Mom's album?

51:54.042 --> 51:55.042
<i>MOM'S ALBUM</i>

52:04.376 --> 52:07.959
<i>You get me worried and
just vanish like that?</i>

52:08.042 --> 52:09.917
<i>I'm in charge now.</i>

52:10.001 --> 52:13.751
<i>If you don't come, I'll ruin your life!</i>

52:13.834 --> 52:15.042
<i>Watch me!</i>

52:15.126 --> 52:16.834
<i>GEUM-GANG REST STOP</i>

52:16.917 --> 52:18.167
A pack of Sol, please.

52:18.251 --> 52:20.001
450 won, please.

52:21.876 --> 52:23.167
450 won.

52:26.209 --> 52:27.834
Wait.

52:27.917 --> 52:28.917
Here.

52:31.709 --> 52:34.292
Is this a joke?

52:34.751 --> 52:36.084
Sorry.

52:41.542 --> 52:45.334
I didn't come 'cuz of your
threats but to set things right.

52:45.417 --> 52:49.084
You're lying about Yeon-a dying, right?

52:49.167 --> 52:51.084
I wish, but it's true.

53:03.167 --> 53:05.084
Why would Yeon-a die?

53:05.792 --> 53:07.126
Cuz of you.

53:07.792 --> 53:08.542
What?

53:08.626 --> 53:11.917
You promised to hold on, but let go.

53:12.001 --> 53:14.001
You took her for granted.

53:14.084 --> 53:17.084
Don't talk like you know me. I'm different!

53:21.459 --> 53:23.667
There was an accident at the zoo.

53:30.292 --> 53:32.209
What accident? When?

53:32.292 --> 53:33.626
I can't say.

53:35.084 --> 53:38.542
But you know everything!

53:39.626 --> 53:41.334
You can save her!

53:41.417 --> 53:42.209
I can't.

53:42.292 --> 53:43.959
Then you'll let Yeon-a die?

53:47.626 --> 53:50.417
I never forgot for 30 years.

53:50.501 --> 53:53.751
If only I could go back and save Yeon-a...

53:55.126 --> 53:56.292
I thought a million times.

53:56.376 --> 53:57.626
Then do it.

53:58.751 --> 54:04.042
Save her. We can stop her from dying!

54:04.126 --> 54:05.251
Soo-a.

54:07.126 --> 54:08.542
My daughter.

54:08.626 --> 54:12.334
She was born 10 years after Yeon-a died.

54:12.417 --> 54:15.292
She was an unexpected gift.

54:17.001 --> 54:18.167
Forget it.

54:18.251 --> 54:20.959
What does she have to
do with saving Yeon-a?

54:21.042 --> 54:23.584
If Yeon-a lives, Soo-a can't be born.

54:23.667 --> 54:25.126
Look.

54:29.251 --> 54:31.542
I can save Yeon-a and
have a child with her.

54:31.626 --> 54:34.209
She's my daughter.

54:34.292 --> 54:39.917
I raised Soo-a for 20 years. I
wouldn't trade her for anyone.

54:40.001 --> 54:42.667
And I can't live in a world without Yeon-a.

54:42.751 --> 54:45.001
The past cannot be changed.

54:45.084 --> 54:47.251
This moment can't be changed either.

54:49.542 --> 54:54.542
It may be the past to you,
but it's the future for me.

54:54.626 --> 54:57.376
And I decide my future!

54:58.626 --> 55:00.084
It's no use.

55:08.126 --> 55:10.001
What if I don't have Soo-a?

55:13.084 --> 55:16.584
If we don't save Yeon-a, I
won't be with anyone else.

55:16.667 --> 55:19.001
Then Soo-a can't be born.

55:28.917 --> 55:34.001
Can you give up everything to save Yeon-a?

55:37.126 --> 55:39.834
Even my life, if I have to!

55:42.042 --> 55:43.917
Even if it's Yeon-a?

55:46.959 --> 55:49.084
Mommy's here!

55:50.959 --> 55:52.834
Potato!

55:55.709 --> 55:57.334
How've you been?

55:59.001 --> 56:01.084
You've grown so much.

56:04.626 --> 56:06.334
<i>Leave Yeon-a.</i>

56:06.917 --> 56:09.834
<i>You mean break up with her?</i>

56:09.917 --> 56:11.959
That's my first condition.

56:12.042 --> 56:13.459
But Yeon-a is my everything.

56:13.542 --> 56:16.042
It's the only way to save Yeon-a and Soo-a.

56:17.584 --> 56:19.167
Can you do it?

56:25.209 --> 56:26.959
Forget it then.

56:32.292 --> 56:33.167
Stop!

56:33.251 --> 56:34.501
Your hands will save lives!

56:34.584 --> 56:37.917
Who cares when I can't even save Yeon-a!

56:41.209 --> 56:42.376
You okay?

56:54.376 --> 56:55.709
Yeon-a...

56:57.584 --> 57:00.042
Please save her.

57:00.751 --> 57:05.001
Second condition is that
you can't tell anyone.

57:05.084 --> 57:08.001
Tae-ho already knows. He can be trusted.

57:08.084 --> 57:09.292
I know.

57:10.126 --> 57:14.167
But it could change Tae-ho's life.

57:14.251 --> 57:18.126
We don't know what can change the future.

57:18.209 --> 57:20.376
It has to be just the two of us.

57:20.459 --> 57:23.834
No, just the one man who knows.

57:25.292 --> 57:26.376
Remember...

57:26.459 --> 57:29.209
You can't meet Yeon-a again.

57:31.251 --> 57:36.667
She'll be alive somewhere, but
we must live like she's gone.

57:43.334 --> 57:46.084
HAN Soo-hyun.

57:48.001 --> 57:50.209
- Soo-hyun?
- Hmm?

57:50.292 --> 57:52.001
How's Soo-a?

57:54.626 --> 57:57.209
- Soo-a?
- Yup.

57:57.292 --> 57:59.001
For our baby's name.

57:59.084 --> 58:01.501
Soo' from Soo-hyun and 'a' from Yeon-a.

58:01.584 --> 58:03.709
Soo-a is a pretty name.

58:10.376 --> 58:14.167
- It is.
- That's it?

58:14.709 --> 58:16.626
What if it's a boy?

58:21.667 --> 58:24.501
It'll be a girl who resembles you.

58:42.042 --> 58:42.584
<i>BUSAN HOSPITAL</i>

58:42.667 --> 58:44.751
- <i>Packed your passport?</i>
- Yes.

58:44.834 --> 58:46.334
<i>Should I meet you at Seoul Station?</i>

58:46.417 --> 58:48.126
No, come to the airport.

58:48.209 --> 58:49.292
Do you miss me?

58:49.376 --> 58:51.959
<i>Of course. It's been 2 months.</i>

58:52.042 --> 58:57.959
In 9 hours and 20 minutes, we
can be together for 3 days.

58:58.042 --> 58:58.876
Yeon-a...

58:58.959 --> 59:00.126
Hmm?

59:00.209 --> 59:01.167
Be careful.

59:01.251 --> 59:03.959
Okay. See you later.

59:04.042 --> 59:05.084
Bye.

59:13.667 --> 59:14.917
Dr. HAN?

59:15.001 --> 59:16.667
Call from geriatrics.

59:18.626 --> 59:20.292
Dr. HAN speaking.

59:47.626 --> 59:49.709
Go away!

59:49.792 --> 59:53.709
Abandon me here and live
it up why don't you!

59:53.792 --> 59:57.834
You're just like your mom. That bitch!

59:57.917 --> 59:59.126
Stop it, will you?

59:59.209 --> 01:00:03.167
When I get my hands on
her, I'll drag her to...

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:06.126
What did Mom do! You tortured her for life!

01:00:06.209 --> 01:00:11.126
Don't take her side! She had an affair!

01:00:12.084 --> 01:00:16.376
You're the one who cheated!
Come to your senses!

01:00:16.459 --> 01:00:21.167
She cheated on me with you!

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:23.209
When will you stop?

01:00:23.292 --> 01:00:25.251
I've had it!

01:00:25.626 --> 01:00:30.292
I'll catch her even if I die!

01:00:30.376 --> 01:00:33.334
Bring the bitch to me now!

01:00:33.876 --> 01:00:38.292

The day Yeon-a dies.

01:00:48.334 --> 01:00:50.501
And Dad passes away too.

01:00:50.584 --> 01:00:53.167
How can I tell her about Dad?

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:58.209
I was going to tell her later.

01:00:58.292 --> 01:00:59.584
I know.

01:01:00.001 --> 01:01:03.834
You pushed it off and didn't
tell her till the end.

01:01:05.084 --> 01:01:07.584
- Then the call...
- Yes.

01:01:08.334 --> 01:01:10.292
<i>I called her 30 years ago.</i>

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:14.542

<i>Then I'll come to you.</i>

No, don't!

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:32.042
I'll be stuck in the hospital for 3 days.

01:01:32.126 --> 01:01:37.709
<i>But it's our vacation! We
haven't met in 2 months.</i>

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:39.834
I have to stay with the patient.

01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:42.751
What about me? The
patient's more important?

01:01:42.834 --> 01:01:45.292
Don't say that. I'm a doctor.

01:01:45.376 --> 01:01:47.709
How can you only think of yourself?

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:50.917
<i>I'm sorry, Yeon-a. Let's talk later.</i>

01:02:18.126 --> 01:02:21.209
She's never been like this.
What's with her?

01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:24.709
Call for help. I'll calm her down.

01:02:25.584 --> 01:02:29.126
Somebody help! Anybody there?

01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:33.126

It's tomorrow's paper.

<i>FEMALE TRAINER DIES SAVING DOLPHIN</i>

01:03:01.251 --> 01:03:03.084
There's no time.

Now, it's your turn.

01:03:07.167 --> 01:03:09.376
We must change that article.

I have to cancel the trip.
Something urgent came up.

01:03:21.584 --> 01:03:23.459
<i>You're the only doctor there?</i>

<i>Then take the next flight.</i>

<i>But it's our vacation! We

Then come to me.

01:04:02.251 --> 01:04:04.167
- You came?
- Soo-hyun...

01:04:05.126 --> 01:04:07.126
Sorry to make you come.

01:04:09.334 --> 01:04:11.126
I'm so sorry.

01:04:11.209 --> 01:04:13.251
I had no idea.

01:04:21.251 --> 01:04:24.417
Let's step out. We need to talk.

01:04:29.584 --> 01:04:33.876
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've come sooner.

01:04:33.959 --> 01:04:36.376
I would've been with him when you're busy.

01:04:36.459 --> 01:04:39.126
Why would you see him?

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.209
Because he's your dad.

01:04:41.292 --> 01:04:46.626
When I was young, he beat Mom all the time.

01:04:49.584 --> 01:04:53.501
He was a drunken wife abuser.

01:04:53.584 --> 01:04:57.209
- Now he's...
- It's okay.

01:04:57.292 --> 01:04:59.126
You don't have to tell me.

01:05:05.584 --> 01:05:09.417
Mom left home when I was 14.

01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:12.084
She couldn't take the beatings anymore.

01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:14.584
Then he started throwing punches at me.

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:20.084
I wanted to run away too.

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:26.251
But I couldn't leave in case Mom came back.

01:05:27.084 --> 01:05:29.334
I got a call when I was 18.

01:05:29.417 --> 01:05:31.292
Mom died.

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:37.751
She hung herself where she worked.

01:05:39.751 --> 01:05:41.376
So listen.

01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:51.376
I can't make the family you dream of.

01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:53.209
I can't.

01:05:53.292 --> 01:05:55.042
- But...
- Don't you get it?

01:05:55.126 --> 01:05:57.584

01:06:05.334 --> 01:06:08.292

- Ever since you wanted a baby...

01:06:08.334 --> 01:06:11.667

01:06:11.751 --> 01:06:13.626

Of course I'm not!

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:48.167
I'll do it! You assist.

01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:49.667
We need an anesthesiologist.

01:17:49.751 --> 01:17:51.376
Who's on call today?

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:53.126
SONG Hae-won.

01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:54.417
Get ready to operate.

01:18:01.126 --> 01:18:04.042
- How've you been Dr. SONG?
- Who are you?

01:18:04.334 --> 01:18:07.084
A patient needs urgent surgery.

01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:08.709
You have to help.

01:18:09.667 --> 01:18:11.376
It's HAN Soo-hyun's girlfriend.

01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:29.459
Why'd I wake up so soon?

01:18:36.292 --> 01:18:38.584
That CT scan was yours?

01:18:38.667 --> 01:18:41.084
Why is your name on this?

01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:43.334
Oh that...

01:18:43.417 --> 01:18:46.417
Let's go into surgery now.

01:18:46.501 --> 01:18:48.667
I have to go save someone.

01:18:48.751 --> 01:18:51.126
You need to save yourself!

01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:54.292
I have no time. Thank you.

01:18:54.376 --> 01:18:55.626
Thank me for what!

01:18:56.959 --> 01:18:58.084
Come on...

01:18:58.709 --> 01:19:00.959
Sedative...

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:15.667
2:47...

01:19:20.584 --> 01:19:22.334
There's no time to wait.

01:19:25.542 --> 01:19:26.834
Dr. HAN!

01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:28.751
Scalpel.

01:19:39.251 --> 01:19:40.709
Sorry I'm late.

01:19:50.334 --> 01:19:52.167
You lead.

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:59.209
Let's start the surgery.

01:19:59.292 --> 01:20:00.792
Everything's ready.

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:08.459
The mastoid.

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:09.626
The mastoid.

01:20:12.042 --> 01:20:13.334
Brace drill.

01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:14.501
Brace drill.

01:20:17.626 --> 01:20:19.584
- Suction.
- Suction.

01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:33.584
Doctor!

01:20:34.626 --> 01:20:36.709
Yeon-a, hold on for 5 minutes.

01:20:36.792 --> 01:20:38.334
Please Yeon-a...

01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:42.376
What's going on?

01:20:42.459 --> 01:20:43.792
Who ordered this surgery?

01:20:43.876 --> 01:20:45.917
Who comes in during a surgery?

01:20:46.001 --> 01:20:47.959
Who are you?

01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:50.709
HAN Soo-hyun! SONG Hae-won!

01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:52.001
Are you insane!

01:20:52.084 --> 01:20:54.292
You want to shut down our hospital!

01:20:54.376 --> 01:20:56.626
You missed a blood clot.

01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:57.667
What?

01:20:58.959 --> 01:21:01.959
Come in to help or get out.

01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:04.751
Go!

01:21:05.751 --> 01:21:08.792
You fools.

01:21:09.542 --> 01:21:10.626
Dr. SONG?

01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:13.542
- Lock the door.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:16.626
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir!

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:21.459
SONG Hae-won!

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:23.459
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go!

01:21:23.542 --> 01:21:25.917
There. It's done.

01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:29.917
Are you okay?

01:21:30.917 --> 01:21:32.501
I'll do the rest.

01:21:57.834 --> 01:22:00.251
Open the door now!

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.501
Open up!

01:22:21.126 --> 01:22:23.917
Your first surgery went well.

01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:25.917
Take care of the rest.

01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:30.376
Thank you.

01:22:33.126 --> 01:22:35.251
I should thank you.

01:22:36.292 --> 01:22:38.959
My last operation was Yeon-a too.

01:22:41.126 --> 01:22:42.459
Yeon-a.

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.334
Hang in there.

01:22:53.251 --> 01:22:56.709
Who is that man?

01:22:56.792 --> 01:22:58.459
A doctor.

01:22:58.542 --> 01:23:00.792
A doctor from afar.

01:23:14.251 --> 01:23:15.376
Dad!

01:23:16.084 --> 01:23:17.376
Soo-a...

01:23:20.501 --> 01:23:25.459
You were out for 3 days.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:26.751
I was?

01:23:28.334 --> 01:23:29.542
I'm sorry.

01:23:29.626 --> 01:23:31.667
I was so scared.

01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:37.709
Daddy's fine.

01:23:39.792 --> 01:23:41.792
Don't worry.

01:23:43.542 --> 01:23:45.209
So glad you're okay.

01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:06.376
<i>PATIENT STABLE AFTER REMOVING BLOOD CLOT</i>

01:24:13.751 --> 01:24:18.542
Did you know Ms. CHOI was the
first female trainer of Korea?

01:24:18.626 --> 01:24:20.626
She's amazing.

01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:24.501
Wish I could've seen her in action.

01:24:25.584 --> 01:24:27.501
She's over there.

01:24:27.584 --> 01:24:29.417
That's her rock.

01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:35.126
She trains and sits there
to look out to the sea.

01:24:36.001 --> 01:24:38.167
Go down this way.

01:24:38.251 --> 01:24:39.584
Thank you.

01:25:57.126 --> 01:26:01.001
I didn't realize Dad died young.
He was my age.

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:04.251
He cursed Mom till the end.

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:07.084
Maybe he missed her.

01:26:07.167 --> 01:26:09.376
He didn't know how to apologize.

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:12.084
How's Yeon-a?

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.376
She's fine.

01:26:14.292 --> 01:26:16.167
Everything will be fine, right?

01:26:17.126 --> 01:26:18.292
Of course.

01:26:19.001 --> 01:26:21.501
Does she have any side effects?

01:26:21.584 --> 01:26:23.126
She's alive.

01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:26.001
We saved Yeon-a.

01:26:27.251 --> 01:26:29.251
Let's be happy with that.

01:26:41.417 --> 01:26:43.167
Things will be okay.

01:26:44.501 --> 01:26:47.542
I lost Yeon-a and Tae-ho.
How can it be okay?

01:26:48.626 --> 01:26:50.709
Does it have to be a happy ending?

01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:54.209
The story itself is important.

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:57.251
Just live your life to the fullest.

01:26:58.459 --> 01:27:00.334
That's not easy.

01:27:02.459 --> 01:27:05.584
This is the last time we meet.

01:27:12.417 --> 01:27:15.584
I'll miss you, HAN Soo-hyun.

01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:17.584
Young man.

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:19.542
Now, it's your turn.

01:27:49.376 --> 01:27:50.626
Excuse me.

01:27:51.626 --> 01:27:53.917
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.

<i>MAY 2nd, 1994

01:28:03.209 --> 01:28:09.917
This is the complex case of
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

01:28:10.001 --> 01:28:13.501
<i>My third and final condition...</i>

01:28:13.584 --> 01:28:17.876
9 years from now, you'll meet
a woman at a conference.

01:28:20.876 --> 01:28:24.209
Spend some time with her.

01:28:27.167 --> 01:28:29.417
She'll be Soo-a's mother.

01:28:38.167 --> 01:28:41.667
You showed hope for children
with heart defects.

01:28:42.376 --> 01:28:44.084
You came to the conference?

01:28:45.501 --> 01:28:48.709
I'm Elaina Hong, a
cardiologist at Johns Hopkins.

01:28:48.792 --> 01:28:51.959
Nice to meet you. I'm HAN Soo-hyun.

01:28:52.042 --> 01:28:55.292
I got curious about you.

01:28:56.042 --> 01:28:58.334
Your thesis was interesting.

01:28:58.417 --> 01:29:00.209
You must love kids.

01:29:00.292 --> 01:29:02.167
I guess I do.

01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:07.959
The sea is always so pretty.

01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:11.542
So beautiful.

01:29:12.542 --> 01:29:13.709
Me?

01:29:30.626 --> 01:29:32.084
Hello?

01:29:32.584 --> 01:29:35.209
<i>It's Elaina.</i>

01:29:35.292 --> 01:29:36.751
<i>Remember me?</i>

01:29:37.542 --> 01:29:38.626
Yes.

01:29:40.001 --> 01:29:42.584
<i>Sorry to decide this on my own...</i>

01:29:45.417 --> 01:29:48.376
<i>We have a surprise gift in life.</i>

01:29:52.042 --> 01:29:56.334
<i>It's a girl. She resembles you.</i>

01:30:14.584 --> 01:30:16.001
Soo-a. We're home.

01:30:16.084 --> 01:30:17.376
No! Potato! Stay inside.

01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:23.626
Daddy was so worried.

01:30:27.001 --> 01:30:29.417
That's my book.

01:30:46.167 --> 01:30:48.209
Soo-a! Call me.

01:31:07.376 --> 01:31:08.667
Bye, Dad.

01:31:44.834 --> 01:31:46.626
You hid it well.

01:31:48.167 --> 01:31:50.167
Damn old man.

01:31:56.501 --> 01:31:57.626
Dad?

01:31:58.126 --> 01:31:59.292
Dad?

01:32:02.501 --> 01:32:04.334
Should we go inside?

01:32:04.417 --> 01:32:05.376
No.

01:32:05.792 --> 01:32:07.876
The cool air is refreshing.

01:32:10.584 --> 01:32:12.292
Soo-a...

01:32:12.376 --> 01:32:14.709
Sorry I was a clumsy dad.

01:32:14.792 --> 01:32:16.376
Don't say that.

01:32:16.876 --> 01:32:19.001
I was the stubborn one.

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:21.042
No.

01:32:21.917 --> 01:32:25.292
I was so happy to have you as my daughter.

01:32:26.626 --> 01:32:27.834
Me too.

01:32:29.959 --> 01:32:33.376
I was lucky to have you as my dad.

01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:40.376
- Dad.
- Hmm?

01:32:41.792 --> 01:32:49.876
If I miss someone I can't
meet, what should I do then?

01:32:58.126 --> 01:33:00.584
Think of happy times together.

01:33:02.251 --> 01:33:05.751
The happiest moment with that person.

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:11.042
The memories will make you live on.

01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:34.501
Dad? Are you crying?

01:33:34.584 --> 01:33:35.584
No.

01:33:37.001 --> 01:33:38.251
I'm not.

I struck rich with it.

01:34:19.584 --> 01:34:25.334
After avoiding me for 30
years, how could you...

01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:29.167
Are you Tae-ho by chance?

01:34:30.542 --> 01:34:31.542
Who's asking?

01:34:31.626 --> 01:34:33.626
I'm HAN Soo-a.

01:34:41.167 --> 01:34:42.834
He had a daughter?

01:34:43.584 --> 01:34:44.626
Yes.

01:34:45.334 --> 01:34:47.417
Dad was right.

01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:50.792
He said you'd be the last
to leave his funeral.

01:34:50.876 --> 01:34:53.251
Your dad said that?

01:34:53.667 --> 01:34:54.667
Yes.

01:35:03.126 --> 01:35:07.251
He asked to give you this.

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:09.126
What is it?

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:10.792

How's the farm?

01:36:06.209 --> 01:36:07.209
Good.

01:36:12.209 --> 01:36:14.417
Is something wrong?

01:36:14.501 --> 01:36:17.334

He had lung cancer.

01:36:50.626 --> 01:36:53.209
I thought I was over him.

01:37:00.626 --> 01:37:05.501
Now, I guess I have to be.

01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:15.376
How could he...

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:20.042
Yeon-a?

01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:21.417
Read this.

01:37:44.501 --> 01:37:46.376
He went 9 times.

01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:57.167
Seven, eight... Ninth was the sea...

01:37:58.292 --> 01:37:59.792

01:38:17.251 --> 01:38:18.459
Where is it?

01:38:23.251 --> 01:38:24.876
Where'd he leave it?

01:38:29.376 --> 01:38:31.167
His favorite song!

01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:42.084

01:38:43.626 --> 01:38:45.417
It really exists!

01:38:50.751 --> 01:38:51.751

01:38:51.834 --> 01:38:54.334
<i>Tae-ho? What does this mean?</i>

01:38:54.417 --> 01:38:58.084
- <i>Time travelling?</i>
- That's right.

<i>You expect me to believe this?</i>

01:38:59.542 --> 01:39:02.626

01:39:09.334 --> 01:39:10.459
<i>What?</i>

01:39:10.542 --> 01:39:11.792
I'll bring Soo-hyun back.

01:39:11.876 --> 01:39:14.292
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:39:14.376 --> 01:39:16.501
Trust me, Yeon-a!

01:39:17.376 --> 01:39:19.292
Take the pill and sleep, huh?

01:39:27.001 --> 01:39:28.417
Gotta sleep.

01:39:41.042 --> 01:39:42.542
Why can't I sleep?

01:39:43.251 --> 01:39:44.959
Am I too anxious?

01:39:47.084 --> 01:39:48.126
What the hell!

01:39:55.626 --> 01:39:57.209
Son of a bitch!

01:39:57.292 --> 01:39:59.626
No jaywalking!

01:39:59.709 --> 01:40:01.709
I'm a cop!

01:40:01.792 --> 01:40:03.626
He just dissed me!

01:40:05.792 --> 01:40:07.209
Geeze!

01:40:07.292 --> 01:40:08.417
Who are you?

01:40:08.501 --> 01:40:10.209
Why are you here?

01:40:13.751 --> 01:40:15.209
Wow!

01:40:16.792 --> 01:40:18.292
This is for real!

01:40:18.376 --> 01:40:20.417
Real or fake!

01:40:20.501 --> 01:40:22.501
How'd you get in here?

01:40:22.584 --> 01:40:23.667
Fool!

01:40:28.626 --> 01:40:31.584
I'm sorry. Let's go to Busan Hospital.

01:40:31.667 --> 01:40:34.376
- Why there?
- Hurry up!

01:40:37.417 --> 01:40:40.667
Know this is a police car?

01:40:41.376 --> 01:40:42.501
I know.

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:51.084
Quit smoking! Damn it!

01:40:51.167 --> 01:40:52.209
Who are you?

01:40:52.292 --> 01:40:53.167
What?

01:40:53.251 --> 01:40:55.292
Who are you to...

01:40:55.834 --> 01:40:56.834
Tae-ho!

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:58.709
I'm KANG Tae-ho!

01:40:58.792 --> 01:40:59.459
What?

01:40:59.542 --> 01:41:02.376
Your friend KANG Tae-ho!
Don't I look the same?

01:41:04.459 --> 01:41:05.209
KANG Tae-ho?

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:06.417
Yes, Soo-hyun!

01:41:09.792 --> 01:41:11.251
Tae-ho!

01:41:12.667 --> 01:41:15.126
It's really you!

01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:16.917
Wait.

01:41:17.751 --> 01:41:18.876
How'd you come here?

01:41:18.959 --> 01:41:22.709
I took the last pill to come.

01:41:22.792 --> 01:41:24.709
My heart is about to burst.

01:41:24.792 --> 01:41:26.459
Then you must know everything.

01:41:26.542 --> 01:41:28.709
- Yes, I do.
- I'm sorry.

01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:31.584
Stupid fool! Cold, stubborn fool!

01:41:31.667 --> 01:41:34.751
Why'd you break ties for 30
years and keep it to yourself?

01:41:34.834 --> 01:41:37.626
- We don't meet for 30 years?
- That's right!

01:41:38.751 --> 01:41:41.251
I'm sorry, pal. I had no choice.

01:41:41.334 --> 01:41:44.376
Why wait to die to tell me everything?

01:41:44.459 --> 01:41:46.209
Die?

01:41:46.292 --> 01:41:47.542
Must be time to go.

01:41:47.626 --> 01:41:50.126
It's okay, Soo-hyun.

01:41:50.209 --> 01:41:53.084
Let's meet in 30 years. Promise?

01:41:53.292 --> 01:41:58.292
Forget the last 30 years!
Let's meet again, pal.

01:41:59.542 --> 01:42:01.001
30 years is too long.

01:42:01.084 --> 01:42:05.626
No, 30 years fly by like a bullet!

01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:08.667
- I'll be waiting!
- I'm sorry.

01:42:08.751 --> 01:42:10.792
Love you, pal!

01:42:10.876 --> 01:42:13.584
Let's meet again!

01:42:17.084 --> 01:42:18.626
Thanks pal.

01:42:20.667 --> 01:42:22.251
KANG Tae-ho...

01:42:43.834 --> 01:42:45.501
What happened?

01:42:48.251 --> 01:42:50.459
Stupid fool!

01:42:50.542 --> 01:42:52.501
I'm so stupid!

01:42:52.584 --> 01:42:55.376
What if it didn't work?

01:42:58.667 --> 01:43:00.209
Soo-hyun!

01:43:00.292 --> 01:43:01.667
Soo-hyun!

01:43:02.751 --> 01:43:04.501
Crazy fool!

01:43:04.584 --> 01:43:06.751
I forgot to tell him about lung cancer!

01:43:06.834 --> 01:43:09.542
How could I forget to warn him?

01:43:10.084 --> 01:43:11.334
Soo-hyun!

01:43:11.417 --> 01:43:13.459
Soo-hyun!

01:43:41.417 --> 01:43:44.417
<i>Next stop is Seoul Grand Park.</i>

01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:50.334
<i>Please get off here for the entrance.</i>

01:43:50.417 --> 01:43:56.417
<i>Please remain seated until
the train is stopped.</i>

01:44:01.626 --> 01:44:06.126
Welcome to Seoul Grand Park, a
place of dreams and adventures!

01:44:06.209 --> 01:44:08.959
- Hello!
- Welcome to Seoul Grand Park.

01:45:39.876 --> 01:45:41.959
How long were we apart?
