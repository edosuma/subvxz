WEBVTT

01:24.042 --> 01:25.961
We have a confit chicken thigh

01:26.044 --> 01:28.797
with winter squash,
brown butter, pickled onion,

01:28.881 --> 01:30.716
benne seed, lovage, and lime.

01:30.799 --> 01:35.012
And as a starter, a frisÃ©e salad
dressed in a chorizo citrus vinaigrette

01:35.095 --> 01:37.431
with a sous vide duck egg to finish.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.017
May I have it with a quail egg to finish?

01:40.392 --> 01:42.436
Unfortunately, the chef uses a duck egg.

01:42.811 --> 01:47.816
That's odd, because quail egg
improves vision, reduces chronic disease.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.653
Plus, the larger yolk
for satisfying flavor.

01:54.615 --> 01:59.036
Hello. I would like to speak to someone
regarding your acquisition of quail eggs.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.037
Chef not here.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.999
May I leave you a delicious sample
for your pleasure?

02:05.167 --> 02:06.502
Okay. Thank you!

02:11.215 --> 02:12.299
Excuse me.

02:12.758 --> 02:17.179
You know what would really pull this
restaurant up to the major big leagues?

02:19.264 --> 02:20.474
Smaller eggs?

02:21.517 --> 02:23.810
May I leave you a delicious sample
for your pleasure?

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
Here's my card.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.611
Faraz!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.363
What's up, my man?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.448
Hey, Victor. What's up, my man?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.243
Wasn't Behrad supposed to work today?

03:21.326 --> 03:22.536
He had study group.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.998
Yes. He has a 3.65 GPA, my son, huh?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.708
I know. You always tell me.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.459
Hey, how was quail-egging?

03:29.543 --> 03:33.005
You know, I don't want to count my quails
before they're born,

03:33.463 --> 03:37.092
but Momofuku just added quail eggs
to their tasting menu.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.261
People are talking.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.846
People need to start buying.

03:41.305 --> 03:45.100
Don't worry. The restaurant industry
is always hungry for new trends.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.643
For sure.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.854
I'm gonna send you a link to Eater.com.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.690
It has this article
on the best brunches in Brooklyn.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.984
Brooklyn will love quail eggs.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.653
-They're fascinated by newness.
-Yeah.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.114
I saw the first season of Girls.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.824
Okay.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.956
-Sheila. Drive safe!
-See you tomorrow.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.041
Hey, Craig!

04:09.124 --> 04:11.084
Go Knicks! Pistons suck!

04:11.502 --> 04:12.920
Good luck with the dentist.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.339
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I send you the recipe!

04:22.888 --> 04:26.141
-3.5% is not gonna get that done.
-Okay.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.768
So you gotta make it worthwhile for me.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.687
Yasmin, come! You're missing Shark Tank.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.107
Their valuation is crazy.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.944
You always side with Lori.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.654
I think it's a smart idea.

04:38.737 --> 04:42.241
I don't think that I would be
as good a partner for you as other people.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.034
Solely for that reason, I'm out.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.202
Later.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.662
Hey!

04:46.995 --> 04:48.747
-Where are you going?
-It's trivia night.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.708
Trivia? Trivia can wait five minutes.
Come.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.461
Sit with your parents.
I haven't seen you all day.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.382
I'm good.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.551
Yeah.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.806
The store owner's making one dollar
per $100 transaction or two dollars?

05:05.889 --> 05:07.432
-A dollar per transaction.
-A dollar.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.853
So that means I have to risk
$1,000 of my register for ten dollars.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.396
Enough with the mouse.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.897
We need to find a new apartment.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.191
I will call Super Manny
in the morning. Okay?

05:16.608 --> 05:17.943
Jason's roommate's moving out.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.403
There's an open room there, so--

05:19.486 --> 05:20.821
The three of us in one room?

05:20.904 --> 05:21.989
I meant just me.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.615
And you're gonna leave your mother?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.660
Iranians don't leave
until they get married.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.203
Iranian-Americans do.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.372
There is still an Iranian in there.

05:30.455 --> 05:35.586
Besides, why would you pay a stranger
when you can just live here for free?

05:35.669 --> 05:40.048
Baby, you tell Super Manny
to only use humane extermination.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.927
If one little mouse's spine gets broken,
I'm gonna let him have it.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.763
I will take care of it, my queen.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.660
A chocolate to end your night sweetly.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.120
Merci.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.877
He's going to move in with his friends.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.504
It's what they do here.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.089
It's a bad system.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.300
But don't worry.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.345
I'll fix it.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.978
Super Manny, we see the mouse.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.313
You don't see the mouse?

06:37.731 --> 06:40.734
-I missed.
-Pay for exterminator, Super Manny.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.402
Why I pay for exterminator?

06:42.486 --> 06:43.487
I see no mouse.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.405
Forget it. We're going to move out.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.449
Where can you go? Beverly Hills?

06:47.533 --> 06:49.660
No one should live like this,
with a rodent.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.203
Okay, I tell you the truth.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.455
The owner,
he does not want to pay for exterminator.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.540
I have tried.

06:54.957 --> 06:58.335
I told you to use the killing traps
that I have given to you.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.586
I'll call you back.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.339
I thought you were good negotiating?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.423
What am I supposed to do?

07:03.507 --> 07:05.092
We need exterminator.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.718
Forget about this place.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.764
I'll buy us a house with stainless steel
appliances, like back home.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.893
You always thinking of going to moon
when we haven't left the ground.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.772
Why don't we start
with getting rid of the rodents, huh?

07:18.856 --> 07:22.192
Yesterday, I'm taking a bath
and the mouse is watching me.

07:23.402 --> 07:24.862
He wouldn't turn away.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.989
I cannot blame him.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.826
Even a rodent
is transfixed by your beauty.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.459
Yas?

07:41.170 --> 07:43.005
I'm going to take you to the moon.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.013
Behrad.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.223
Shift is at two.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.558
I'll take us to dinner after.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.934
Yes, Dad. I'll be there.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.981
Troy! Jason.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.524
-Hey, Mr. S.
-Hey.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.901
How are you?

08:03.984 --> 08:04.985
Hey.

08:06.695 --> 08:07.821
The Foragers.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.200
It's just "Foragers." No "the."

08:11.617 --> 08:15.412
You know, I can write up a business plan
so the band can become profitable.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.498
You know who's a massive artist
and a massive businessman?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.042
-Bono.
-Bono.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.628
Yes! He owns, like, lots of castles.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.338
And he invested in Yelp.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.632
And he makes great music.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.258
You coming to our show next week?

08:28.759 --> 08:30.010
You're joking me?

08:30.761 --> 08:31.803
Your first concert?

08:31.887 --> 08:34.722
I'm going to be in the first row,
video-ing everything.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.017
Now you have your foot in the door.

08:37.392 --> 08:40.729
And soon you will have two feet
in even a bigger door.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.147
You're the Bono.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.857
You're the Edge.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.859
And you're...

08:46.693 --> 08:48.654
one of the other members of U2.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.365
And so it begins! Good job.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.201
It's cool your dad's a big kisser.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.994
My dad just shakes my hand.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.837
Hey. You know, Behrad's in a band.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.839
They have a gigantic concert next week.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.343
Watch. He will change his name to Barry.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.804
Nah. He loves his name, you know.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.139
See you next Saturday for football?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.391
Of course.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.450
Just take magazine. It's free.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.829
Great time to invest
right here in Yonkers.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.499
It's exactly like New York,
but less loud and much cheaper.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.168
The city that sleeps.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.962
You know, I love Yonkers.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.507
My son, Behrad, goes to CUNY Lehman.

09:50.591 --> 09:54.595
3.65 GPA. Business administration.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.056
He's also a musician, like Bono from U2.

09:58.140 --> 10:02.436
You know, I want a home where he can
have a room to practice his drums,

10:02.519 --> 10:05.314
and for my wife to have a home office.

10:05.397 --> 10:08.108
You know, she is an expertise tailor.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.486
This is the place. Bang for your buck.
Only going up, up, up.

10:11.570 --> 10:15.157
And my credit score is 710.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.909
You mentioned that a few times.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.287
Don't worry. We'll find you a better place
than you had in Iran.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.877
You know, people think I escaped Iran.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.796
I had a good life in Iran.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.131
A great life.

10:32.007 --> 10:37.221
I came to America to provide my family
new and excellent opportunities.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.765
That was my choice.

10:40.724 --> 10:44.144
So, please, don't feel sorry for me.

10:44.686 --> 10:45.729
That's great.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.565
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.733
It's okay.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.610
This is a beautiful house.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.363
Yes, it is.
The sellers are very motivated.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.115
And it's only 610,000.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.955
The house is very close to the street.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.332
And although the walk to the curb
is quick,

11:05.415 --> 11:07.751
ultimately it will become a nuisance.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.421
And for this reasons, I'm out.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.886
Very close to the street. Very close.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.388
This is the one.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.723
Three bedrooms, two baths,

11:21.807 --> 11:24.476
and, oh, my gosh,
there is the most charming attic

11:24.560 --> 11:26.854
with this beautiful floral paper.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.188
You're not gonna believe it.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.816
It puts the quaint in "quaint."
It's just gorgeous.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.609
It's very nice.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.278
And the rent is very reasonable.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.946
Rent? I want to buy.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.240
Get out of here! My room!

11:38.657 --> 11:41.618
The listing agent said
the squatter will be gone by next week.

11:41.702 --> 11:42.953
I'll never leave!

11:43.412 --> 11:47.040
Do you have anything for me to buy
in my price range?

11:51.336 --> 11:52.921
This is what you get in your range.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.299
Wow!

11:56.258 --> 11:58.427
$65,000 for this?

11:59.344 --> 12:00.554
It's a steal.

12:00.971 --> 12:04.516
Well, yeah, it's only 65,000,
but you see the rock, right?

12:06.310 --> 12:09.271
Well, it depends on how you look at it.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.815
You see a rock.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.484
I see an opportunity.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.370
Yes.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.877
This is where we will live.

12:34.379 --> 12:38.592
I'm going to make an offer of $64,000
and no more.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.177
Okay.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.055
Yas, Yas, Yas.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.139
Yeah, okay.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.601
Okay. Okay. Listen, listen, listen.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.605
So I was so nervous
that someone might snap it up.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.941
So I told Ronni, my private Realtor,

12:54.566 --> 12:59.029
"What can I do to take
this property off your hand today?"

12:59.696 --> 13:03.951
And now, I'm an American landowner!

13:05.702 --> 13:09.998
It's a beautiful investment property
that I'm excited for.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.667
Okay. Let me show you photos. Hold on.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.710
But honey, dinner is ready.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.879
-Let's show photos.
-Yes. We want to see.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.005
We want to see.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.090
Show us.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.597
Where is the house?

13:25.681 --> 13:27.432
I only see a massive rock.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.226
Is the house behind it?

13:30.394 --> 13:33.939
If you use your imagination,
you can see a house.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.526
Okay.

13:37.609 --> 13:38.902
I still only see a rock.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.404
The rock is nothing.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.864
It's a very big rock.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.282
Easily demolished.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.701
I'm going to build a gigantic house.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.120
Behrad is going to have
a room for his drums

13:48.704 --> 13:50.330
and a private bathroom.

13:51.415 --> 13:55.002
-Hey, dog. Congrats, my man.
-Very nice.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.590
Okay. Let's eat. Food is getting cold.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.425
-Please, right this way.
-Let's eat.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.011
Very fantastic, huh?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.638
Okay. Say "cheese."

14:06.722 --> 14:07.723
Cheese.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.099
Okay.

14:09.183 --> 14:12.019
I'm going to make a video
for our friends back home.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.479
Try to frame out the rock.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.357
Hey, everyone.

14:17.441 --> 14:21.195
Welcome to Faraz Land, owned by me.

14:21.278 --> 14:24.072
The house is going to have
lots of windows.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.533
It's going to be tough to clean,
but it's okay.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.329
And the garden, it's going to be here.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.208
Hey? It's gonna have fresh mint for tea.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.836
It's going to be beautiful.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.688
...all the time.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.320
What your dad pulled off here
is really unbelievable.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.197
Yeah, he's a pretty amazing guy.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.241
SalÃ¢mati.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.369
You know why I'm really here.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.371
How do I get in on the quail egg business?

15:12.454 --> 15:13.288
Well--

15:13.372 --> 15:15.040
It's so big.

15:19.002 --> 15:22.005
It gets bigger the closer you get.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.590
You don't like it here?

15:23.674 --> 15:25.300
It's beautiful.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.593
It's just...

15:27.344 --> 15:30.639
we could have started
with a larger apartment first.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.101
One with a whirlpool tub.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.937
You stay at the larger apartment.

15:37.479 --> 15:41.942
Behrad and I will live in a mansion,
custom-built for us.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.533
Okay. I'll stay in the mansion with you.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.911
But first I have to go to the store.

15:54.872 --> 15:55.914
See you for dinner.

15:55.998 --> 15:56.999
Okay.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.721
Hello, my friend.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.602
Not so big.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.548
See you tomorrow.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.177
This was a brilliant idea, my love.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.012
Know your enemy.

16:52.638 --> 16:54.473
The government must divulge

16:54.556 --> 16:56.308
what previous owners
attempted to do with the rock.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.643
That's what permits are for.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.312
So I pulled the plans
from the property in question,

17:00.395 --> 17:03.607
but I need a signed and notarized
affidavit from the titleholder

17:03.690 --> 17:04.816
to allow you to see them.

17:04.900 --> 17:05.901
But I'm the owner now.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.529
Shouldn't I be able to see
the history of my property?

17:09.279 --> 17:10.820
You still have two more weeks in escrow.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.449
I cannot divulge that.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.002
What is that?

17:24.545 --> 17:26.755
-Honey.
-I can't accept gifts.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.841
I insist.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.468
We can't. I'm sorry.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.640
Right down this way, to the left.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.477
My gloves. I'll be right back.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.024
Have you had quail eggs?

17:46.108 --> 17:47.109
What?

17:47.192 --> 17:48.569
A little-known fact.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.404
Quail eggs contain 13%--

17:50.487 --> 17:51.655
Got them.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.157
Thank you very much, Ms. Lianna. Goodbye.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.325
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17:55.409 --> 17:56.577
Where were you going to?

17:57.035 --> 17:59.621
I took pictures of the blueprints
with my phone photo.

17:59.705 --> 18:00.706
Really?

18:01.123 --> 18:02.124
You can still--

18:03.041 --> 18:04.293
You're so bad.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.764
I put your name on the list for tonight
so you don't have to pay a cover.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.018
Yes, yes, your concert.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.980
I already deleted the old video
so I have lots of space to record.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.566
I don't even know if anyone's gonna show.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.569
I just hope we don't suck.

18:32.946 --> 18:33.989
Sorry.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.284
This is Clive. You called me.

18:37.701 --> 18:41.496
I wanted to get a quote from you
for removal of a rock.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.916
Okay. How big is it?

18:43.999 --> 18:46.543
Not so big. About 8,000 square feet.

18:47.044 --> 18:48.045
How deep does it go?

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
No one knows.

18:49.505 --> 18:50.631
Height?

18:50.714 --> 18:52.424
The height of a tall man.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.593
How tall is the tall man?

18:55.469 --> 18:56.470
Eight feet tall.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.846
That is a tall man.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.474
Wait, is this that property on Edwin?

19:00.557 --> 19:02.017
Yes. You already know it?

19:02.434 --> 19:03.894
Everybody knows it.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.396
Sorry, bub. Can't help you.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.481
What?

19:07.564 --> 19:09.441
Hello? Hello.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.401
Dead.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.904
I was impressed with your Yelp stars,

19:13.987 --> 19:16.240
so... do you think it's possible?

19:18.033 --> 19:19.034
Yes.

19:21.662 --> 19:23.038
From one immigrant to another...

19:24.039 --> 19:28.877
what can I do to get your men
to remove my rock for $11,000?

19:29.211 --> 19:30.212
Eleven?

19:30.295 --> 19:31.630
That's all I have left.

19:33.841 --> 19:37.719
I pay my guys cash
to provide a savings for my customers.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.012
Deal!

19:41.765 --> 19:42.766
Okay.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.726
I'll be back in two hours.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.854
Okay. How do you say...

19:47.312 --> 19:49.898
-Oh, yes. Gracias.
-De nada.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.233
Okay.

20:13.297 --> 20:14.423
Explosion.

20:14.506 --> 20:17.092
Then this one over there.
That one's next.

20:17.176 --> 20:18.260
Big one. Yeah, yeah.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.262
So...

20:22.055 --> 20:23.098
Oh, no, no, no.

20:23.182 --> 20:25.267
I have to go. I have to go. Sorry.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.729
Okay. I messed up.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.692
That concert meant a lot to him.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.361
I'm trying to build us a real home.

20:38.197 --> 20:39.573
This is what you do.

20:40.407 --> 20:44.536
You get focused on a project
and everything else falls away.

20:45.454 --> 20:48.040
I swear, it was so much easier in Iran.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.584
There is so much red tape here. It just...

20:50.918 --> 20:53.128
But more reliable Wi-Fi.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.593
I know failure is a gift,

20:59.676 --> 21:03.013
but I'm getting a lot of gifts.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.850
I've spent almost all of our savings.

21:08.393 --> 21:12.481
What if I don't remove the rock
and I lose Behrad in the process?

21:12.564 --> 21:14.942
-Lose Behrad?
-Don't you see?

21:16.360 --> 21:18.612
If I don't get a bigger house,

21:19.196 --> 21:21.281
he's going to move in with the Foragers.

21:22.074 --> 21:23.909
Foragers, no "the."

21:25.536 --> 21:27.329
And then we will never see him.

21:27.996 --> 21:32.626
Azizam, you are pushing him away
by holding on so tight.

21:33.919 --> 21:36.880
He's a growing boy, almost a man.

21:37.506 --> 21:38.882
So what do you suggest?

21:47.558 --> 21:52.104
Focus on Behrad
like you would one of your projects.

21:54.273 --> 21:55.899
Treat him like the rock.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.651
Or the quail eggs.

21:58.485 --> 22:02.155
Or your idea of sunglasses
for people with curly hair.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.455
I'm inspired by this.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.791
Okay. Okay.

22:18.797 --> 22:19.798
Let's see.

22:23.635 --> 22:24.636
Is it good?

22:26.054 --> 22:27.055
By the way,

22:27.139 --> 22:31.560
tomorrow afternoon, the first explosions
are happening at the rock.

22:33.854 --> 22:35.647
Anyway, your father wants us to be there.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.944
This is very important to your father.

22:41.028 --> 22:42.696
Well, if it's important to him.

22:44.323 --> 22:45.324
Baby...

22:47.284 --> 22:51.705
I had words with him
about the concert and everything.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.541
He's disappointed in his actions.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.543
He'll make it better.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.712
He lives in this fantasy world.

22:59.588 --> 23:02.299
That rock isn't moving
and he's crazy if he thinks it will.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.139
Azizam,

23:09.723 --> 23:13.602
your father had his own livestock market
in Tehran.

23:13.685 --> 23:17.481
He had the first digital photo studio
in all of Iran.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.566
When he opened his roller-skating rink,

23:19.650 --> 23:22.778
the Revolutionary Guards
almost threw him in jail.

23:23.570 --> 23:28.158
He sold our beautiful house in Tehran
to work in a parking lot

23:28.242 --> 23:30.869
so you could go to United States college

23:30.953 --> 23:34.373
and you could play silly concerts
in coffee shops

23:34.456 --> 23:36.542
and so you could have the freedom

23:36.625 --> 23:41.213
to be as ambitious
or not ambitious as you want.

23:42.422 --> 23:46.635
So when your father says
that he will build us a beautiful home,

23:47.094 --> 23:50.347
I know in my soul that it will happen.

23:52.808 --> 23:55.853
You think a stupid rock
is going to stop him?

23:57.563 --> 23:59.439
You don't know your father.

23:59.940 --> 24:00.941
All clear!

24:01.441 --> 24:02.526
Hey, Jose.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.028
SeÃ±or. Come. Come.

24:05.988 --> 24:07.823
Can you please explain the process?

24:08.240 --> 24:10.993
How does it work
with this exploratory explosion?

24:11.076 --> 24:12.202
Jose, come on.

24:13.954 --> 24:17.374
I press the button,
and the charges explode.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.209
No, no. Do the countdown.

24:19.293 --> 24:20.836
One, two, three.

24:20.919 --> 24:24.089
Three, two, one.

24:30.762 --> 24:31.847
It's good.

24:33.182 --> 24:35.184
Jose, was it a success?

24:35.267 --> 24:36.643
I don't know.

24:37.394 --> 24:38.520
Jose doesn't know yet.

24:39.563 --> 24:40.939
High-tech radar.

24:41.023 --> 24:43.066
Very sophisticated.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.359
Okay.

24:44.443 --> 24:45.527
So what is the status?

24:45.944 --> 24:46.945
Over here--

24:47.738 --> 24:51.116
Rock goes down six feet and then it stops.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.076
Six feet? Very manageable.

24:53.911 --> 24:54.912
But over here...

24:56.330 --> 24:57.331
Ten feet.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.708
Like underground, a staircase.

25:00.334 --> 25:02.002
Many different heights.

25:02.836 --> 25:03.962
It's very big.

25:04.963 --> 25:05.964
Very big.

25:06.423 --> 25:10.177
Okay, so we bring a bulldozer
and take the debris,

25:10.260 --> 25:11.970
and then we explode again.

25:12.054 --> 25:14.306
And then we explode again.

25:15.307 --> 25:18.101
And then, Jose, we explode again, huh?

25:19.686 --> 25:20.938
It's very big.

25:22.648 --> 25:23.649
Too big.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.406
It's...

25:32.241 --> 25:33.784
It's an ongoing process, you know?

25:33.867 --> 25:34.868
So...

25:47.214 --> 25:48.465
I got you.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.592
Come on.

26:27.379 --> 26:29.590
If I can't be all in, I have to fold.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.633
So I'm sorry. I'm out.

26:32.593 --> 26:34.261
Not a single offer.

26:36.722 --> 26:38.390
Our friend is back.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.809
-...has been called the disruptor.
-Well, the point is...

26:41.643 --> 26:43.228
Azizam, what's wrong?

26:45.731 --> 26:47.316
Okay. Okay.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.701
Did I make a mistake?

27:15.427 --> 27:18.722
-Behrad! What's up, my man?
-Hey, Victor.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.808
Hey, your dad left this here.

27:21.892 --> 27:23.101
Can you give it to him?

27:23.185 --> 27:24.186
Yeah.

27:24.269 --> 27:25.812
Hey, how'd the explosion go?

27:25.896 --> 27:27.314
I didn't make it.

27:27.397 --> 27:30.067
That's too bad. I love when shit blows up.

27:30.567 --> 27:31.777
All right. See you, man.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.509
One square foot of the rock.

28:38.051 --> 28:40.846
Seven thousand,
nine hundred ninety-nine to go.

28:42.764 --> 28:43.765
Night.

28:53.650 --> 28:55.611
And we need a new pickax!

29:22.012 --> 29:24.014
-Baba.
-Hey.

29:24.097 --> 29:25.516
You brought food?

29:26.016 --> 29:27.184
For the guys.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.770
This is my son, 3.65 GPA.

29:29.853 --> 29:31.355
Yeah, you mentioned.

29:33.023 --> 29:34.024
Looking good.

29:34.107 --> 29:36.193
Look how much progress we made, no?

29:36.568 --> 29:37.903
I gotta tell you something.

29:39.321 --> 29:42.366
I've been saving up my money,
and I've been thinking about it a lot,

29:42.449 --> 29:44.701
and I'm gonna rent that room
in Jason's apartment.

29:50.082 --> 29:52.000
You're... a grown boy.

29:52.084 --> 29:55.045
You... are almost a man.

29:59.216 --> 30:01.051
I'm still gonna build you that room.

30:05.389 --> 30:10.269
If you want me to look over
the rental agreement, I'm here.

30:29.413 --> 30:30.956
This is a major hit.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.959
Don't say that.
You'll raise his expectation.

30:34.042 --> 30:38.297
No, no, no. This song inspires
because it is about something.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.507
People aren't talking about
the slaughter industry enough.

30:40.591 --> 30:44.052
This will be an anthem for vegans
because they have had no anthem.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.681
Back to work.

30:48.932 --> 30:50.726
Smaller every day!

30:51.768 --> 30:53.937
He's never gonna stop, is he?

30:54.021 --> 30:55.772
No. You know your father.
