00:00.166 --> 00:01.834
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:01.917 --> 00:03.959
- Zach's gone from Silvercrest.
- Hungry?

00:04.041 --> 00:05.083
<i>Sometimes...</i>

00:05.166 --> 00:07.250
If I don't get help,
I will lose my mind.

00:07.333 --> 00:10.500
- Where can I score some nanny?
<i>- ...no matter how hard you try...</i>

00:10.625 --> 00:13.500
FBI! Carlos Solis,
I have a warrant for your arrest.

00:13.583 --> 00:15.125
<i>...some problems...</i>

00:15.208 --> 00:17.834
- Sorry, you are...?
- You've met Maisy Gibbons?

00:17.959 --> 00:21.000
- She's a nightmare.
- Maisy loves to rule her kingdom.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.250
You are unhappy with our sex life.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.208
You're not getting something
but are afraid to ask.

00:26.333 --> 00:29.208
<i>...can't be easily solved.</i>

00:35.250 --> 00:37.709
<i>To understand Maisy Gibbons,</i>

00:37.792 --> 00:42.125
<i>you first need to know</i>
<i>how she spent her afternoons.</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:45.709
<i>Her mornings were spent</i>
<i>running errands for her husband.</i>

00:45.792 --> 00:47.291
Hi.

00:47.375 --> 00:50.166
<i>Her evenings were spent</i>
<i>helping with homework.</i>

00:50.250 --> 00:52.709
OK, so, nine plus one is...

00:52.792 --> 00:55.000
<i>But her afternoons,</i>

00:55.083 --> 00:58.875
<i>well, they were spent</i>
<i>in the company of men.</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:04.959
<i>Frustrated, misunderstood,</i>

01:05.041 --> 01:10.417
<i>lonely men, willing to pay money</i>
<i>to feel a little less lonely.</i>

01:11.166 --> 01:13.750
<i>And Maisy Gibbons</i>
<i>was willing to help them.</i>

01:13.834 --> 01:18.750
Maisy, I've always wondered. Nobody
knows about your little hobby, do they?

01:20.417 --> 01:21.458
Is it hard?

01:21.542 --> 01:26.041
- Keeping a secret like this?
- Well, maybe if it was just my secret.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.625
But the way I see it, I keep the
secrets of every man who comes to me.

01:31.709 --> 01:35.041
And I find that
absolutely exhilarating.

01:35.125 --> 01:37.208
A few years back, Harold lost his job

01:37.291 --> 01:41.583
and we had to give up our membership
at the country club.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.583
And then one day
one of my club friends

01:44.667 --> 01:46.750
asked why she hadn't seen me around.

01:46.834 --> 01:52.750
I told her that
we couldn't afford it any more.

01:52.834 --> 01:58.667
She waved it off like it was nothing,
but I saw her get that look in her eye,

01:58.750 --> 02:01.667
that look of... pity.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.250
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.000
Anyway, is that so bad,
feeling sorry for someone?

02:08.125 --> 02:11.417
When they say something,
they are being supportive,

02:11.500 --> 02:13.583
but when they say nothing,

02:13.667 --> 02:17.000
they think you're so far gone,
you're never coming back.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.166
Gotcha.

02:18.250 --> 02:23.208
Anyway, a couple months later,
I started my little hobby,

02:23.291 --> 02:25.917
and the most wonderful thing happened.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.500
This woman's husband
became one of my regulars.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.875
Wow.

02:34.125 --> 02:37.542
Would you be a lamb
and go out the back?

02:38.333 --> 02:40.667
- That's my next appointment.
- Sure.

02:40.750 --> 02:44.333
It's the husband of the woman
I was telling you about.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.542
- Hello, there.
- Hey, Maisy.

03:40.083 --> 03:43.583
<i>Every morality play</i>
<i>has its cast of characters.</i>

03:44.458 --> 03:47.417
<i>There is always an innocent victim,</i>

03:47.542 --> 03:51.041
<i>a deceitful villain,</i>

03:51.125 --> 03:54.792
<i>a prosecutor who seeks the truth,</i>

03:54.875 --> 03:58.959
<i>a magistrate who dispenses justice</i>

03:59.041 --> 04:02.625
<i>and a lawyer who charges too much.</i>

04:03.709 --> 04:09.542
<i>This morality play was being produced</i>
<i>at the Fairview County Courthouse.</i>

04:09.625 --> 04:13.500
<i>Its themes were trust and betrayal.</i>

04:13.583 --> 04:17.125
So what's your issue with bail
in this case, Ms McCready?

04:17.208 --> 04:19.625
We want bail denied, Your Honor.

04:19.709 --> 04:23.291
The company imported goods
manufactured by slave labor.

04:23.417 --> 04:26.875
His business partner, Mr. Tanaka,
has fled the country,

04:26.959 --> 04:30.166
and Mr. Solis has refused
to surrender his passport.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.834
Dog ate your client's passport,
Mr. Hartley?

04:32.917 --> 04:35.333
It's been temporarily misplaced,

04:35.417 --> 04:40.667
but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set
up and executed the entire operation.

04:40.750 --> 04:44.750
Mr. Solis is no business partner
but merely a hired contractor.

04:44.834 --> 04:48.041
I'd also like to point out
my client is the sole provider

04:48.125 --> 04:52.417
for his wife and his mother, who is
hospitalized in a coma as we speak.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.375
Bring me the passport
and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.

04:56.458 --> 05:02.291
Until then, your client is denied bail
and remanded. What's next?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.375
Finish those Brussels sprouts.

05:07.458 --> 05:10.500
I can see them
hidden under your macaroni.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.917
I hate Brussels sprouts.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.041
Well, Brussels sprouts help you grow.

05:16.125 --> 05:19.041
You don't want to be short
your whole life, do you?

05:19.125 --> 05:24.667
You know what we'll do? We're gonna dip
'em in a little cheese. Here you go.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.375
- Good. Yummy.
- Disgusting!

05:27.458 --> 05:29.792
Fine. Be 3'8" the rest of your life.

05:29.959 --> 05:32.834
See if I care.
Good luck finding girlfriends.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.667
- Didn't you have a lunch?
- I'm gonna cancel it.

05:35.750 --> 05:39.458
The boys are in rare form,
and you're still finding your way.

05:39.542 --> 05:41.709
Lynette, it's been two days.

05:41.792 --> 05:45.959
I... don't want to shock them
by suddenly disappearing.

05:46.041 --> 05:49.792
- Deep down they're very sensitive.
- That's a paper airplane.

05:49.875 --> 05:53.000
They'll be fine. Now go.
Get out of here.

05:55.583 --> 05:58.041
You call me if you need anything.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.959
- I will.
- OK.

06:01.041 --> 06:04.458
Boys! Come here and give Momma
a three-bear hug.

06:04.542 --> 06:07.792
Come on. Whoo!
One, two, three...

06:07.875 --> 06:09.333
Get in! Get in!

06:09.417 --> 06:12.083
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.709
- Bye!
- OK.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.291
Watch your hands!

06:20.375 --> 06:24.041
I'm gonna eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.542
What, are you storing up for winter?

06:26.625 --> 06:29.208
I'm just really hungry.

06:29.291 --> 06:32.083
I talked to Dad,
and he and Brandi might break up.

06:32.166 --> 06:34.750
Oh, how awful.

06:34.834 --> 06:38.500
- Mom, you're smiling.
- Am I?

06:38.583 --> 06:44.959
Anyway, he can't take me this weekend,
so I'll be home after all. Goodnight.

06:47.917 --> 06:51.000
Great. Our romantic weekend's off.

06:51.083 --> 06:54.750
- We can move it to my house.
- No.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.250
Why not?

06:57.333 --> 06:59.792
I just want it to be special.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.250
And it can't be special at my house?

07:02.333 --> 07:07.291
OK, I know this sounds weird, but I
just need to have my things around me.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.875
- What things?
- Perfumes and oils.

07:09.959 --> 07:13.125
I wanna pick out the outfit
you're gonna tear off me.

07:13.208 --> 07:16.583
And plus I need to be
in complete control of the lighting.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.583
OK. We'll wait till next weekend.

07:19.667 --> 07:22.500
You are just the sweetest guy.

07:27.917 --> 07:31.667
- I can't wait till next weekend.
- No, me neither.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.834
Tomorrow?
I've got an early job and that's it.

07:34.917 --> 07:38.625
My publisher's got me under the gun
for something. Friday?

07:38.709 --> 07:42.750
- I'm re-piping a house.
- Damn Karl!

07:42.834 --> 07:46.750
Not even married any more and
he's still keeping me from having sex.

07:46.834 --> 07:52.667
I can't hide you in my room for ever,
and I think we need to tell my mom.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.375
You can trust her, I promise.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.667
You didn't tell her what I told you?

07:57.750 --> 08:00.375
No! I would never tell anyone that.

08:02.709 --> 08:05.750
- What are you doing?
- I don't wanna cause problems.

08:05.834 --> 08:08.792
I'm just gonna go.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.792
Zach, stop. Don't go.

08:11.875 --> 08:14.625
I won't tell her.

08:15.834 --> 08:19.250
I swear I'll be out of here soon.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.041
I'll think of something, OK?

08:34.333 --> 08:36.875
- Hello.
- Why are you up?

08:36.959 --> 08:39.834
I could ask you the same question.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.583
I'm going to bed.

08:43.417 --> 08:45.834
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.

08:45.917 --> 08:50.083
Remember, I'm here as our
children's father, not your husband.

08:54.583 --> 08:58.041
What are you doing?

08:58.125 --> 09:00.667
Were you with a woman?

09:02.041 --> 09:05.625
Did you tell her you have a wife
or does that hinder your style?

09:05.709 --> 09:09.709
All right, even if I was seeing
someone, I have every right to.

09:09.792 --> 09:12.917
Exploring options
is the point of being separated.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.166
- Options! I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.
- That's not...

09:18.667 --> 09:22.375
Bree, you should get out there,
try and meet someone.

09:23.458 --> 09:27.333
Meet someone?
I'm raising your children.

09:27.417 --> 09:30.250
I am just trying
to move on with my life.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.208
- It is nothing to be ashamed of.
- OK.

09:33.291 --> 09:37.125
Why don't you just call up
your mystery woman and invite her over?

09:37.208 --> 09:40.583
I'll pull out the sofa bed
and you can take her right there.

09:40.667 --> 09:44.083
Andrew! Danielle!
Daddy's gonna fornicate for us!

09:44.208 --> 09:47.333
Just keep your voice down.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.917
Why? Are you feeling ashamed?

09:58.875 --> 10:02.000
<i>The next morning started</i>
<i>with a banging.</i>

10:04.125 --> 10:08.834
<i>No one knew where Martha Huber was,</i>
<i>and Edie Britt was starting to worry.</i>

10:08.917 --> 10:12.583
<i>Edie didn't like worrying.</i>
<i>She felt it gave her wrinkles.</i>

10:12.709 --> 10:16.291
<i>So, out of concern for her face,</i>
<i>and Mrs. Huber,</i>

10:16.375 --> 10:19.709
<i>Edie decided to find out</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

10:23.667 --> 10:27.792
Yao Lin, listen. It's very important
that we find Carlos's passport.

10:27.875 --> 10:32.041
I already looked through his office.
I need you to search the bedroom.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.208
What?

10:33.291 --> 10:38.792
With Mr. Solis in jail, how you
gonna pay me? I have children.

10:38.875 --> 10:41.959
Yao Lin,
your kids are in their twenties.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.625
But if it'll make you shut up...

10:47.625 --> 10:51.000
Here. Three weeks in advance.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.041
If you don't mind,
can I call your bank?

10:54.125 --> 10:58.291
Yao Lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.000
That's my car. Oh, my God.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.500
Hey!

11:09.834 --> 11:14.500
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you taking my car?

11:14.583 --> 11:16.792
The government's impounding it.

11:16.875 --> 11:20.000
Call that number
if you have any questions.

11:28.208 --> 11:30.083
Oh, my word.

11:31.542 --> 11:35.000
You call this a paint job?

11:35.125 --> 11:37.917
I don't want to see it again
till it's perfect!

11:44.834 --> 11:47.041
I wonder what's going on over there.

11:47.166 --> 11:52.125
Claire did OK yesterday. It could have
been beginner's luck. I should call.

11:52.250 --> 11:55.709
For the first time in years
you finally have some free time,

11:55.792 --> 11:59.959
and you're wasting it
obsessing about the kids.

12:03.542 --> 12:08.792
I don't know this woman. So she has
a degree in sociology. Who doesn't?

12:08.875 --> 12:12.375
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?

12:12.458 --> 12:16.917
If you really have that many doubts,
you should go buy a hidden camera.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.792
What, a nanny-cam?

12:18.875 --> 12:22.834
Yeah. People do terrible things
when they think no one's watching.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.458
Yeah.

12:25.542 --> 12:28.709
I couldn't tape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.166
Trust is overrated.

12:35.709 --> 12:38.875
So... how are things with you and Rex?

12:41.417 --> 12:44.000
Fine. Why do you ask?

12:44.083 --> 12:46.917
I'm just curious.
He moves out, moves back in.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.417
Is he back for good?

12:49.500 --> 12:55.166
The situation is... fluid.
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.

13:00.041 --> 13:04.250
So if you're not sure he's back for
good, why are you ironing his shirts?

13:04.375 --> 13:10.125
Because I have faith that he'll come
back and that he'll do the right thing.

13:10.250 --> 13:14.834
That's good.
It's good to have faith in people.

13:14.917 --> 13:17.375
Yeah.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.959
But I'd still buy that camera.

13:44.875 --> 13:48.000
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mike? My oven's out.

13:48.083 --> 13:51.208
Come over and help me
find my pilot light.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.000
Oh, candles.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.542
Mike, is that you?

14:59.375 --> 15:01.458
I'm up here!

15:24.625 --> 15:26.750
Mike?

15:57.875 --> 16:00.291
- Oh, my God! Oh, God.
- What the hell?

16:00.375 --> 16:03.125
I'm so sorry. I thought
someone was in the house.

16:03.250 --> 16:07.208
- So you took your clothes off?
- No, I was going to seduce you.

16:07.333 --> 16:11.250
- Didn't really work.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

16:11.333 --> 16:13.417
Well...

16:17.959 --> 16:20.625
Please don't be mad.

16:23.959 --> 16:26.083
Hey, there.

16:29.458 --> 16:32.458
Zach? What are you doing here?

16:41.417 --> 16:47.166
<i>Later that day, while Claire was out</i>
<i>getting the boys wired on ice cream,</i>

16:47.291 --> 16:50.750
<i>Lynette did some wiring of her own.</i>

17:31.417 --> 17:33.917
You can't do this.
You can't send Zach back.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.083
What else can I do?
He can't stay here.

17:36.208 --> 17:38.709
His father sent him to a psycho ward.

17:39.291 --> 17:42.834
Actually, they call it
a rehabilitation center.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.500
- What do you think?
- Paul is his father.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.875
He has a right to know his son's OK.

17:50.959 --> 17:54.750
If he finds out you're hiding him,
you could get in a lot of trouble.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.625
He's right. Sorry, guys.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.959
Don't do this. If you knew
what Zach had been through...

18:01.041 --> 18:04.208
Julie. Julie, it's OK. I'll be fine.

18:09.667 --> 18:12.083
I'll take him back over
so you two can...

18:12.166 --> 18:16.208
Listen, if Paul sees Zach
and freaks out...

18:16.291 --> 18:19.166
- I'll bring him right back.
- Thank you.

18:27.125 --> 18:30.542
Young lady, we need to talk
about what you did.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.291
I don't feel like
talking to you right now.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.291
Listen, Zach...

18:46.959 --> 18:50.542
If things ever get really bad...

18:50.625 --> 18:53.000
It's got my cell number on it.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.291
Give me a call... any time.

18:57.917 --> 18:59.959
Thanks.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.333
Thank God.

19:16.792 --> 19:19.000
- How did you...?
- We'll talk later.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.208
Remember, any time.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.458
- I heard you moved back home.
- Yeah, I had to.

19:43.542 --> 19:47.959
We had some problems with Andrew.
I'll move out eventually.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.834
- Spikes or pearls?
- Your choice.

19:50.959 --> 19:55.458
You know what I think?
You don't really want to leave her.

19:55.583 --> 19:58.458
- Don't psychoanalyze me.
- You're still in love.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.750
- I never said I wasn't.
- Why divorce?

20:00.834 --> 20:05.208
So now you're rooting
for us two crazy kids to work it out?

20:07.583 --> 20:11.875
You know me.
I'm just a romantic at heart.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.041
Scarves or cuffs?

20:15.208 --> 20:19.417
Up to you. Even if I could
find a way to deal with

20:19.542 --> 20:23.291
Bree's obsessive-compulsive thing,
it's not the only problem.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.000
As you know, I have certain needs.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.709
Boots or stilettos?

20:31.333 --> 20:34.083
Stilettos, please.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.709
Why don't you just tell Bree
what you need?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.583
Tell her what you want.

20:44.667 --> 20:47.041
- Because she'd say no.
- So?

20:47.125 --> 20:49.917
I've said no to some things
you've asked me to do.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.583
Yeah, that's different.
I don't care if you reject me.

20:59.917 --> 21:04.125
Rex, would you trust me on this?

21:04.208 --> 21:08.417
Sometimes when you love somebody,

21:08.542 --> 21:11.583
you just gotta make sacrifices
for them.

21:11.709 --> 21:15.083
Love or passion.
That's an awful choice to make.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.083
Yes, it is.

21:19.583 --> 21:24.250
I have to warn you,
this might hurt a little bit.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.208
How am I supposed to live
without a car?

21:37.291 --> 21:40.792
Tanaka's still at large
and they want Carlos to flip on him.

21:40.917 --> 21:45.667
This is their way of playing hardball.
I'm guessing that they're not done yet.

21:45.750 --> 21:49.959
- Why? What else could they take?
- Pretty much anything.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.792
It's all fair game if they can trace it
to ill-gotten gains.

21:53.875 --> 21:58.583
No, some of this stuff is mine, when
I modeled, before I even met Carlos.

21:58.667 --> 22:03.166
See this? Kosta Boda. I bought it
when I landed my first cover.

22:03.291 --> 22:07.166
This... I spent eight hours on a rock
in a bikini for that painting.

22:07.291 --> 22:09.542
- I understand how you feel.
- You don't.

22:09.625 --> 22:12.875
I have dug myself up from dirt
to afford these things

22:13.000 --> 22:15.291
and no one is gonna take them away.

22:15.375 --> 22:20.667
Then find a good hiding place.
They can't take what they can't find.

22:20.792 --> 22:24.208
And if you can scare up
that passport, that would be good.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.542
- Hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.792
- What have you got there?
- My china.

22:33.875 --> 22:39.000
You've always loved it. I thought
you might wanna borrow it for a while.

22:39.709 --> 22:42.041
Well, that's very thoughtful of you.

22:42.166 --> 22:45.583
Say, can I store some odds and ends
in your garage?

22:45.667 --> 22:47.959
Sure. Why don't you
come by tomorrow?

22:48.041 --> 22:50.542
Sooner's better than later.

23:35.542 --> 23:38.667
- Just like...
- Come on now.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.875
Yes!

23:46.000 --> 23:47.083
Rex?

23:48.041 --> 23:49.250
Rex?

23:50.417 --> 23:52.083
Rex!

23:57.250 --> 24:00.417
I need an ambulance. Right away.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.792
Hello?

24:18.917 --> 24:22.542
Yes, this is she.
Yes, he's my husband.

24:29.333 --> 24:34.208
I'm here to see Rex Van de Kamp.
Apparently he had a heart attack.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.625
He's being prepped for surgery now.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.709
Could I at least poke my head in?
I'm his wife.

24:39.792 --> 24:42.208
- You're his wife?
- Yes. Why?

24:43.041 --> 24:47.208
I was thinking of a different patient.
Let me get the doctor.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.959
<i>As Claire prepared for bed,</i>

25:10.041 --> 25:14.125
<i>she was unaware that</i>
<i>somewhere else in the Scavo house</i>

25:14.250 --> 25:18.959
<i>the day she had just finished</i>
<i>was starting all over again.</i>

25:27.125 --> 25:32.000
<i>Lynette was relieved to see</i>
<i>that Claire was doing a good job.</i>

25:41.375 --> 25:44.000
<i>- After further viewing...</i>
- Three-bear hug.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.583
<i>...it dawned on Lynette...</i>

25:49.375 --> 25:53.041
<i>...Claire might be doing her job</i>
<i>a little too well.</i>

26:12.834 --> 26:15.959
Here's the candles I borrowed.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.500
Thanks.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.875
I'm trying to read, if you don't mind.

26:20.959 --> 26:25.291
I cannot believe, after everything
you did, you're mad at me.

26:26.917 --> 26:30.250
I told Zach that he could trust you
and you turned him in.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.500
Well, someone had to be responsible.

26:32.583 --> 26:36.792
Like it or not, I've got a birth
certificate that says I'm your mother.

26:36.917 --> 26:39.583
- Since when?
- What is that supposed to mean?

26:39.667 --> 26:43.375
Since Dad left, if there's been
a mother here, it's been me.

26:43.458 --> 26:45.125
Julie!

26:46.959 --> 26:51.583
After the divorce you stayed in bed
for a week and I had to beg you to eat.

26:52.709 --> 26:53.750
Yeah, but...

26:53.834 --> 26:57.000
I had to clean the house,
make sure the bills were paid,

26:57.083 --> 26:59.458
even schedule
my doctor's appointment.

26:59.583 --> 27:03.083
- I was in bad shape back then.
- It's still going on.

27:03.166 --> 27:07.000
And now that I need some support,
you decide to play the mom card?

27:07.083 --> 27:11.333
I had to send Zach back. We could
have gotten in a lot of trouble.

27:11.417 --> 27:13.667
Now Zach's the one who's in trouble.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.875
You sent him back to a man
who hates him.

27:24.125 --> 27:29.542
<i>As Gabrielle considered the vast</i>
<i>emptiness of her new surroundings,</i>

27:29.625 --> 27:34.917
<i>she was surprised to find there was</i>
<i>only one thing she truly missed...</i>

27:36.750 --> 27:38.834
<i>...her husband.</i>

27:47.208 --> 27:49.625
We have a warrant to enter your house

27:49.709 --> 27:56.166
and repossess any goods we suspect
may have been obtained... illegally.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.583
We're not into clutter.

28:03.542 --> 28:07.166
All right. <i>Harvey The Flying Turtle.</i>
Doesn't this look fun?

28:07.250 --> 28:10.041
- Where's Claire?
- I gave her the afternoon off.

28:10.125 --> 28:12.583
- Who wants to turn pages?
- Is she sick?

28:12.667 --> 28:16.709
No. I just wanted us all to spend
the day together, like we used to.

28:16.834 --> 28:20.792
Here we go. "Once upon a time
there was a young turtle named Harvey."

28:20.875 --> 28:26.083
"Harvey told the other turtles 'I'm
going to fly off and see the world.'"

28:26.166 --> 28:29.000
"The other turtles said
'Turtles can't fly!'"

28:29.083 --> 28:32.375
It's getting good now, huh?

28:33.625 --> 28:38.709
- Well, what's wrong?
- Claire does funny voices.

28:40.834 --> 28:43.333
Does she, now? OK.

28:44.291 --> 28:48.083
"Harvey didn't like
the turtles laughing so he told them

28:48.166 --> 28:52.083
'I'll show you!
I will fly higher than the birds.'"

28:52.166 --> 28:57.417
- That's not funny.
- Yeah, well, I'm just warming up.

28:57.542 --> 29:02.250
"Bruno, the big bad turtle, took Harvey
up on the cliff and threw him over."

29:02.333 --> 29:08.417
"He proclaimed 'We'll see if
you can fly! Fly or die! Fly or die!'"

29:09.458 --> 29:11.750
When's Claire coming back?

29:15.542 --> 29:18.291
What happened to your nails?

29:19.583 --> 29:22.250
I moved all our stuff
to keep it from the Feds.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.250
It kills me that
I'm putting you through this.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.583
Hands on the table.

29:33.709 --> 29:37.000
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.

29:37.083 --> 29:40.834
I'll take care of everything
until you're back to do it yourself.

29:40.917 --> 29:43.709
And you will be soon.

29:43.792 --> 29:47.917
I gotta be honest. I didn't know
how you would hold up.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.208
I knew you were a strong woman,
but I had no idea.

29:51.291 --> 29:54.250
You're a good wife, Gaby.
A real partner.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.750
Carlos, I love you so much.

29:58.834 --> 30:01.500
I would give up
a houseful of expensive junk

30:01.583 --> 30:05.333
just to put this behind us
and have you home with me.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.792
That sounds pretty good right now.

30:09.083 --> 30:13.709
- I'm gonna kiss my husband now.
- Hands on the table.

30:19.834 --> 30:23.583
There's a false panel
on the back wall of my closet.

30:23.667 --> 30:27.083
My passport is there,
along with some papers.

30:27.166 --> 30:31.458
Take the passport to the lawyer
and burn the papers.

30:46.166 --> 30:49.458
Carlos, did you know
what Tanaka was doing?

30:51.208 --> 30:55.291
Just burn the papers.

31:08.333 --> 31:12.792
Hey, Lynette. Did Martha Huber leave
a spare key to her house with you?

31:12.875 --> 31:17.542
No. Where is she, by the way?
I haven't seen her in days.

31:17.625 --> 31:21.041
You got me. She kicked me out so fast
that I forgot my laptop,

31:21.125 --> 31:25.959
and there's just some stuff on there
that I don't want anyone else to see.

31:26.875 --> 31:29.375
Well, good luck with that.

31:32.917 --> 31:38.250
You're not looking half bad. What
have you done with your little posse?

31:38.333 --> 31:42.667
- They're with the new nanny.
- Wow. Your own personal nanny?

31:42.750 --> 31:45.750
Smell you.

31:45.834 --> 31:48.458
Trust me,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

31:48.542 --> 31:51.709
Our mothers didn't get us nannies
or put us in daycare

31:51.792 --> 31:54.959
because they knew
if they did we'd find out

31:55.041 --> 31:59.417
there are other women out there
who were better mothers than they were.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.250
I had a nanny for a while growing up.

32:02.333 --> 32:05.083
- Mrs. Muntz.
- You had a nanny?

32:05.166 --> 32:09.375
Well, actually, she was more like
a court-appointed social worker.

32:09.458 --> 32:14.834
My mom did a little time. She had
a thing for bourbon and... shoplifting.

32:15.959 --> 32:20.166
- Sorry.
- Muntz was a hard-ass. No mercy.

32:20.250 --> 32:24.166
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian
that when my mom made parole,

32:24.250 --> 32:26.750
I was actually happy to see her.

32:26.834 --> 32:28.709
Really?

32:28.792 --> 32:31.250
Yeah. Lesser of two evils.

32:33.208 --> 32:34.667
Anyway, I gotta find a key.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.875
- See you later.
- Bye.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.959
Thanks for your help with Zach before.

32:42.041 --> 32:45.333
It's my pleasure.
I hope he comes out of this OK.

32:45.417 --> 32:48.709
He's a little squirrelly,
but he seems like a good kid.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.959
Yeah.

32:51.959 --> 32:55.041
So, how's Julie taking all this?

32:55.125 --> 33:00.125
Not well. She accused me
of not being a good mother.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.375
No, you're a great mom.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.959
Well, she was sort of right.

33:06.625 --> 33:10.083
After my divorce,
I really leaned on her a lot.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.959
Seems natural.

33:13.041 --> 33:15.750
And I still kinda do it.

33:17.917 --> 33:21.250
I just want somebody
to talk to about all my adult stuff,

33:21.333 --> 33:24.959
and she's right there,
and she just acts so mature,

33:25.041 --> 33:27.333
I forget she's thirteen.

33:27.417 --> 33:30.792
Well, the good news is
that from now on,

33:30.875 --> 33:35.917
if you ever want to talk to somebody
about grown-up stuff, you got me.

33:41.375 --> 33:43.750
I can't talk to you about everything.

33:46.083 --> 33:49.083
What if I want to talk about
the big crush I have

33:49.166 --> 33:52.333
on the plumber
that lives across the street?

33:52.458 --> 33:55.500
- Big crush, huh?
- Yeah.

33:55.583 --> 33:58.417
Well, you'd have to tell me more.

33:58.500 --> 34:04.083
Well... he's got a smile
that's to die for.

34:04.166 --> 34:08.000
And don't get me started
on his tattoo.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.917
Thanks.

34:24.458 --> 34:26.333
Bree.

34:26.417 --> 34:29.041
What a nice surprise.

34:29.125 --> 34:31.250
Would you like to come in?

34:31.333 --> 34:34.041
Well, that depends.

34:34.125 --> 34:37.625
Are you having an affair
with my husband?

34:43.250 --> 34:46.917
- Would you like some more potatoes?
- You already asked me that.

34:48.500 --> 34:53.709
Sorry. I'm so relieved you're safe,
I'm not thinking straight.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.250
Does that mean you're not gonna
send me back to Silvercrest?

34:57.333 --> 35:00.667
You've gotta understand,
your behavior, the violence,

35:00.750 --> 35:04.083
breaking into the Van De Kamps...

35:04.166 --> 35:06.875
I just didn't know
what you were going through.

35:06.959 --> 35:09.083
You could have asked me.

35:10.125 --> 35:12.208
Well...

35:12.917 --> 35:16.041
I've been remembering things.

35:17.542 --> 35:20.667
Things from when I was little.

35:24.125 --> 35:26.959
- What kind of things?
- Awful things.

35:27.792 --> 35:32.208
Zach, listen to me. Sometimes
it's not good to look back on the past.

35:32.291 --> 35:36.709
But I can't help it. These images
just keep popping into my head.

35:36.792 --> 35:39.959
You've got to find a way
to push them back out again.

35:43.959 --> 35:45.625
OK.

35:48.750 --> 35:51.458
More potatoes?

35:51.625 --> 35:54.125
Yes, please.

36:03.458 --> 36:06.750
Sure is nice to be back to normal.

36:14.875 --> 36:20.917
You should know that Rex
still loves you... very much.

36:22.875 --> 36:26.000
- He said that?
- Yes.

36:30.083 --> 36:33.458
Then why is he so unhappy?

36:33.542 --> 36:37.291
He has certain needs, and he's afraid
to discuss them with you.

36:37.375 --> 36:40.792
Needs? Like sexual needs?

36:41.375 --> 36:42.917
Yes.

36:44.458 --> 36:47.625
And have you fulfilled those needs?

36:54.041 --> 36:56.166
I see.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.500
You are pretty brazen
for a woman who just admitted,

37:03.583 --> 37:06.709
however tacitly, that she just slept
with my husband.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.834
If I told anyone,
they would never speak to you again.

37:09.917 --> 37:13.125
You're not gonna tell a soul.

37:13.208 --> 37:17.333
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate
the humiliation a lot more.

37:17.792 --> 37:19.875
I don't hate you, Maisy.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.750
I pity you.

37:28.667 --> 37:30.834
- Hi.
- Hey, Lynette.

37:30.917 --> 37:33.000
- You heading out now?
- Yep.

37:33.083 --> 37:36.500
I'll be home late,
so just the usual routine.

37:36.583 --> 37:40.208
- A nap for Penny and...
- No sugar after five. I got it.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.417
You're the best.

37:44.083 --> 37:47.834
One more thing. Since the boys
are having corndogs for dinner,

37:47.917 --> 37:52.291
I'd like you to make sure
they get a vegetable to go with it.

37:54.083 --> 37:57.583
- Brussels sprouts?
- They're full of iron.

37:57.709 --> 38:01.792
- Make sure they clean their plates.
- Not a problem. I have this trick.

38:01.917 --> 38:05.917
- I cover the veggies with some cheese.
- You sly dog.

38:12.291 --> 38:17.125
<i>That night Lynette settled in</i>
<i>to watch her personal pick</i>

38:17.250 --> 38:19.959
<i>for feel-good movie of the year.</i>

38:21.625 --> 38:24.208
You need to eat your Brussels sprouts.

38:24.291 --> 38:28.625
- Brussels sprouts? Disgusting!
- I don't want this!

38:29.291 --> 38:33.083
Hey! Yes, you do! Don't throw them.

38:33.166 --> 38:36.959
- Hey! Hey, stop it!
- I hate Brussels sprouts!

38:37.041 --> 38:39.250
You guys, stop it!

38:39.333 --> 38:42.291
Do not throw them at me. Cut it out!

38:56.291 --> 38:58.375
Hey.

39:01.375 --> 39:02.792
Hey.

39:04.458 --> 39:06.542
They operated, huh?

39:13.500 --> 39:15.583
They sure did.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.500
How'd it go?

39:20.458 --> 39:25.792
It went well. The surgeon says
you're gonna be as good as new.

39:30.083 --> 39:33.583
- You look like you've been crying.
- I have.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.625
I was so afraid you were gonna die.

39:40.709 --> 39:44.875
There's so many things
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

39:47.250 --> 39:50.625
- I'm sorry you were so worried.
- That's OK.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.125
How are you now, Rex?

39:54.208 --> 39:59.625
Are you strong enough to listen
to the things I need to tell you?

39:59.709 --> 40:01.792
Sure, hon.

40:07.875 --> 40:10.375
I know you still love me.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.667
Maisy told me.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.208
She did?

40:26.542 --> 40:32.000
As of this moment, Rex,
I am no longer your wife.

40:32.083 --> 40:36.625
I am gonna go out and find
the most vindictive lawyer I can find,

40:36.750 --> 40:40.125
and together
we are going to eviscerate you.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.792
I am gonna take away your money,

40:42.875 --> 40:46.834
your family and your dignity.

40:48.125 --> 40:50.458
- Do you hear me?
- Bree...

40:50.583 --> 40:55.542
And I am so thrilled
to know that you still love me.

40:57.125 --> 41:00.250
Because I want
what's about to happen to you...

41:02.458 --> 41:06.333
...to hurt as much
as is humanly possible.

41:11.458 --> 41:15.125
I'm so glad you didn't die
before I got a chance to tell you that.

41:36.625 --> 41:39.917
<i>Trust is a fragile thing.</i>

41:42.125 --> 41:45.000
- Bye, guys!
- Bye, Mom!

41:45.959 --> 41:49.959
<i>Once earned,</i>
<i>it affords us tremendous freedom.</i>

41:53.542 --> 41:58.500
<i>But once trust is lost,</i>
<i>it can be impossible to recover.</i>

42:02.542 --> 42:07.625
<i>Of course, the truth is,</i>
<i>we never know who we can trust.</i>

42:13.625 --> 42:17.041
<i>Those we're closest to can betray us.</i>

42:20.625 --> 42:22.458
Police, open up!

42:22.542 --> 42:26.542
<i>And total strangers</i>
<i>can come to our rescue.</i>

42:28.542 --> 42:34.625
<i>In the end, most people</i>
<i>decide to trust only themselves.</i>

42:34.709 --> 42:38.875
<i>It really is the simplest way</i>

42:38.959 --> 42:42.083
<i>to keep from getting burned.</i>
