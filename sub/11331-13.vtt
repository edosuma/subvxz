<i>GRACE: Previously on
The Secret Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.635 --> 00:05.702
I cannot believe we did that.
I can't either.

00:05.737 --> 00:06.670
Do you remember that cooking
school you applied to in Italy?

00:06.704 --> 00:08.338
Yeah?
You got accepted.

00:08.373 --> 00:09.506
I love you!
I've always loved you!

00:09.540 --> 00:11.141
Hi there.

00:12.243 --> 00:13.277
Don't you recognize me?

00:13.311 --> 00:15.045
No.
Clementine?

00:15.079 --> 00:16.312
She's a girl I lived
with in foster care.

00:16.347 --> 00:18.115
We were at the same
house for not even a year.

00:18.149 --> 00:19.883
I have something to
tell you. What's that?

00:19.917 --> 00:19.983
The divorce papers
came through.

00:22.887 --> 00:23.854
I'm in love with Adrian.
I want to marry her.

00:23.888 --> 00:25.889
Do you know
what you're having?

00:25.923 --> 00:28.825
She's a girl, but I'm
letting a couple adopt her.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.694
The girls are here. They're
walking the halls. There's a party?

00:30.728 --> 00:32.762
If I scream, how much
can you come up with?

00:32.797 --> 00:35.465
How old are you?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.401
Fifteen-year-old-girl gets nabbed by
some guy, turned into a prostitute.

00:37.435 --> 00:38.435
I'm not your husband.

00:38.469 --> 00:39.436
We have to do
something about that.

00:39.470 --> 00:41.271
My dad got
remarried yesterday.

00:41.306 --> 00:43.140
I'm transferring.

00:43.174 --> 00:46.143
Jack got beaten within an inch of
his life, probably by that pimp.

00:46.177 --> 00:49.146
We would like to
have you in our family.

00:49.180 --> 00:50.113
Shall we pray?

00:52.984 --> 00:54.751
(GASPS) Hi! Hi!

00:54.786 --> 00:55.786
Meet your parents,
baby girl.

00:58.756 --> 01:00.657
It's what we planned,
so I have to.

01:00.692 --> 01:03.427
I have to go
back to my family.

01:03.461 --> 01:05.429
You don't sound as if
you want to go back.

01:05.462 --> 01:07.331
Your grandmother said you
could stay if you want.

01:07.365 --> 01:09.299
She said that she'd
talk to your mom and dad.

01:09.334 --> 01:12.235
She did talk to them, and
then they talked to me,

01:12.270 --> 01:13.437
and I don't know,

01:13.471 --> 01:16.173
I don't want
the first thing I do

01:16.207 --> 01:17.341
after having a baby to be
breaking a promise to my parents.

01:17.375 --> 01:19.176
I promised them
I'd come home when,

01:19.210 --> 01:21.178
as they put it,
all of this was over,

01:21.212 --> 01:24.047
and it's over.

01:24.082 --> 01:26.683
How are you
feeling about that?

01:26.718 --> 01:28.885
You're not a shrink. I've
gone to counseling. I'm okay.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.787
I don't know why people insist
on my being upset and depressed

01:30.822 --> 01:32.522
because the baby
was adopted.

01:32.557 --> 01:33.757
That's a good thing.
Yeah, I know.

01:33.791 --> 01:36.727
I meant how are you
feeling about going back?

01:36.761 --> 01:38.462
I'm conflicted.

01:38.496 --> 01:39.663
I want to do
the right thing.

01:39.697 --> 01:43.300
I mean, I've done enough
wrong things in their eyes,

01:43.334 --> 01:46.336
so if they think I should be with
them, then I want to be with them.

01:46.371 --> 01:49.172
On the other hand,
I really hate to leave.

01:49.207 --> 01:51.308
I'm not the same
person that I was.

01:51.342 --> 01:53.043
I've lost touch
with my friends.

01:53.077 --> 01:54.911
They all eventually
quit texting or calling me,

01:55.813 --> 01:57.914
and I have new friends.

01:57.949 --> 02:00.751
Ethan?
Yeah, Ethan.

02:00.785 --> 02:01.585
And you know,
my other friends.

02:01.619 --> 02:02.753
Jody and Francine?

02:02.787 --> 02:05.689
I don't think I'd
stay for those two.

02:05.723 --> 02:07.691
Don't you think we're
friends? You and me?

02:07.725 --> 02:10.660
I know you're officially just my mentor,

02:10.695 --> 02:11.661
but I kind of think
of you as my big sister.

02:12.563 --> 02:14.297
Do you?
Yeah.

02:14.332 --> 02:15.399
I never had a sister.

02:15.433 --> 02:16.533
Yeah, me neither.
Ashley?

02:18.369 --> 02:22.038
Oh, geez, whoa.
What am I thinking?

02:22.073 --> 02:25.142
I totally forgot
for a moment.

02:25.176 --> 02:29.813
Ashley and I were never
really that close, obviously.

02:29.847 --> 02:33.650
I mean, from time to time, when it's
really counted, she's been there, but...

02:33.684 --> 02:34.885
You really think
of me as a sister?

02:34.919 --> 02:37.888
Hello? I was the first person
who saw your wedding dress.

02:37.922 --> 02:39.656
Yeah.
And I didn't laugh.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.558
It's a great dress.

02:41.592 --> 02:43.727
I'm just saying. Your
showing it to me first

02:43.761 --> 02:45.462
and my not laughing, that's kind
of sisterly, don't you think?

02:45.496 --> 02:48.565
Oh, Kathy,
I'm going to miss you,

02:48.599 --> 02:50.233
I really am.

02:50.268 --> 02:53.136
You're such a nice girl.

02:53.171 --> 02:54.271
I really hate
to see you leave.

02:54.305 --> 02:56.106
And I hate to go.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.174
Everyone back there
knows I had a baby.

02:57.208 --> 03:00.010
Everyone here knows
you had a baby, too.

03:00.044 --> 03:01.077
People are going to talk.
That's just what people do.

03:01.112 --> 03:03.079
You just have
to deal with it.

03:03.114 --> 03:05.015
There I have to deal
with it all by myself.

03:05.049 --> 03:07.017
Here, at least, I have people
on my side standing up for me.

03:07.051 --> 03:09.619
Then maybe you should tell your
parents what you're telling me.

03:09.654 --> 03:12.522
The bottom line is
they don't like Ethan.

03:12.557 --> 03:14.424
They want me away from him. Oh.

03:14.459 --> 03:16.626
And they're not too
crazy about you, either.

03:16.661 --> 03:19.596
Me? What did I do?

03:19.630 --> 03:23.133
Is it John? Or is it
because I'm marrying Ricky?

03:23.167 --> 03:27.103
Both. And that's what they're
afraid would happen if I stay here.

03:27.138 --> 03:29.105
They're afraid that
because I had a baby,

03:29.140 --> 03:31.975
I've grown up too fast and
I'll get married too young.

03:32.009 --> 03:35.078
It's a new year and they want
me to get off to the right start.

03:35.112 --> 03:36.947
Go right back to where I
was before I got pregnant.

03:38.716 --> 03:40.951
Impossible.

03:40.985 --> 03:42.919
Well, maybe you can at least go back
to where you left off a little wiser.

03:48.793 --> 03:54.664

04:08.937 --> 04:09.646
Hi.
Hi.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.616
What are you doing here?

04:13.450 --> 04:15.418
I told you just to tell me what you wanted
on the phone because I've got to study.

04:15.452 --> 04:18.487
I got John and Amy out of the
house and I've got to study.

04:18.522 --> 04:19.721
Can we talk?

04:19.755 --> 04:21.624
About what, Ethan?
What's the emergency?

04:21.658 --> 04:23.426
You already
know what it is.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.494
Kathy leaving is
not an emergency.

04:25.529 --> 04:28.564
No, it is! You have to talk
to Margaret and Shakur for me.

04:28.598 --> 04:30.466
Why's that? Because I
want to go with Kathy.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.469
Go with her where? Back to
Texas? For what? To live?

04:33.503 --> 04:35.504
Live in Texas? Me? No.

04:35.539 --> 04:36.605
I want to talk to
her parents face-to-face

04:36.640 --> 04:38.407
and beg them
to let her live here.

04:38.442 --> 04:40.509
That's between
Kathy and her parents

04:40.544 --> 04:41.577
and that's just what Margaret
and Shakur are going to tell you.

04:41.611 --> 04:43.679
I know.

04:43.714 --> 04:45.681
That's why I'm trying
to figure out

04:45.716 --> 04:48.517
how to get a different answer
out of them, how to play them.

04:48.552 --> 04:49.719
Why don't you just
tell them the truth?

04:49.753 --> 04:51.620
Because it's not
a good enough reason.

04:51.655 --> 04:54.490
Then maybe you
shouldn't ask to go,

04:54.524 --> 04:57.360
or ask, realizing that they're
probably going to tell you no.

04:57.394 --> 04:58.594
And when they do,
don't cry about it.

04:58.628 --> 05:01.397
I can't take
no for an answer.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.399
I have to go there. I have to
at least try to keep her here.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.333
I'm in love
with the girl.

05:04.368 --> 05:06.335
Not up to me.

05:06.370 --> 05:08.471
Okay.

05:08.505 --> 05:11.774
If you were my parent and you
heard what you just heard from me,

05:13.477 --> 05:13.509
would you let me go?

05:14.845 --> 05:17.646
I don't know, maybe.

05:17.681 --> 05:19.515
Ricky said if he was my
parent, he'd let me go.

05:19.549 --> 05:20.816
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

05:20.851 --> 05:24.687
That's why we don't play
"what if" in this house.

05:24.721 --> 05:27.523
"What if Ricky were my
parent. " (CHUCKLING)

05:27.557 --> 05:28.824
We play "what is. "

05:28.859 --> 05:33.462
And what is is we are
your parents, not Ricky.

05:33.497 --> 05:35.464
And I think this sounds
like a terrible idea.

05:35.499 --> 05:36.766
What do you think?

05:38.835 --> 05:42.805
I think maybe I should
discuss this with my wife

05:42.839 --> 05:45.641
and then we'll
get back to you.

05:45.675 --> 05:48.544
That's not "I think it
sounds like a terrible idea. "

05:48.879 --> 05:49.578
I'll take it.

05:51.882 --> 05:54.550
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

05:54.584 --> 05:57.620
He's 15 and we're going
to put him on a plane

05:57.654 --> 06:00.489
to go talk to two people
who don't like him

06:00.524 --> 06:02.792
so he can ask them if his
girlfriend can stay here

06:02.826 --> 06:06.595
for the next three and a half
years after she's had a baby?

06:06.630 --> 06:07.797
Uh-uh.
He's in love.

06:08.698 --> 06:10.499
So in love.

06:11.802 --> 06:13.502
And I really
like this Kathy.

06:13.537 --> 06:16.772
And please don't
quote the statistics

06:16.807 --> 06:18.574
on how many teenage girls have a baby

06:18.608 --> 06:20.709
and then
have another baby,

06:20.744 --> 06:23.546
even though I know that's what's
going on in the back of your mind.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.682
She's not going to do that,
if that's what you're thinking.

06:26.716 --> 06:29.585
They are not going to
do anything like that.

06:29.619 --> 06:30.820
They're probably already
doing something like that.

06:30.854 --> 06:32.721
But not that.

06:33.757 --> 06:35.724
They're not.
Well.

06:35.759 --> 06:38.461
If her parents want her
back in Houston,

06:38.495 --> 06:39.662
they want her
back in Houston

06:39.696 --> 06:41.597
and we shouldn't
interfere with that.

06:41.631 --> 06:42.698
No, we shouldn't.

06:46.603 --> 06:49.772
But maybe Ethan should,
even if the answer is no.

06:49.806 --> 06:53.509
It's such
a manly thing to do,

06:53.543 --> 06:56.612
to stand up for his woman,
to face the parents

06:56.646 --> 06:59.381
even if they give him a no,
which, more than likely, they will.

06:59.416 --> 07:01.383
At least he did what
he thinks is right,

07:01.418 --> 07:03.152
and at least he's telling
us what he wants to do

07:03.186 --> 07:05.321
instead of stealing
something and selling it

07:05.355 --> 07:07.256
to buy a plane ticket
behind our backs.

07:07.290 --> 07:10.059
Well, I do like that
he came to us

07:10.093 --> 07:13.195
and told us what
he was gonna do.

07:13.230 --> 07:16.131
But Ethan flying around
the country on his own,

07:16.166 --> 07:18.067
I don't know about that.

07:18.101 --> 07:20.669
Come on.

07:20.704 --> 07:22.771
I really think it will
be to his benefit,

07:22.806 --> 07:23.806
and possibly
to her benefit.

07:25.509 --> 07:27.443
All right.

07:27.477 --> 07:29.578
Thank you! Thank you! Thank
you! You won't regret it!

07:29.613 --> 07:31.514
I'm going to need
some money, of course.

07:31.548 --> 07:32.515
(CHUCKLES) Of course.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.286
How'd it go?

07:37.320 --> 07:40.222
With Kathy?
Not that good.

07:40.257 --> 07:44.159
She feels obligated to go back
to Texas to please her parents

07:44.194 --> 07:48.197
but she won't talk to them and tell
them that she doesn't want to go.

07:48.231 --> 07:49.932
But I don't know,
she's 15.

07:49.966 --> 07:52.034
She should probably
go home to her parents.

07:52.068 --> 07:54.637
On the other hand,
this could be the beginning

07:54.671 --> 07:56.672
of her trying to do what
everyone else wants her to do

07:56.706 --> 07:58.774
instead of doing what she
wants to do and that stinks.

08:02.412 --> 08:04.513
Ethan came over here.

08:04.548 --> 08:06.415
He wants to try to fly back with
Kathy and talk to her parents.

08:06.449 --> 08:08.417
Really?
Really.

08:08.451 --> 08:10.286
He took the bus over
so I took him home

08:10.320 --> 08:13.022
and then I went back to
your dad's and picked up John

08:13.056 --> 08:14.957
because I knew I'd just have
to leave again to do that

08:14.991 --> 08:16.258
and then I had to put him
down for his nap

08:16.293 --> 08:17.927
and now I really
have to study.

08:17.961 --> 08:19.061
I know.

08:19.095 --> 08:20.129
But since you've
stopped for the moment...

08:20.163 --> 08:21.964
Moment's over.
Guess what I bought.

08:21.998 --> 08:24.066
If it's over $100,
we agreed to talk about it.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.734
It's not over $100.

08:25.769 --> 08:26.769
Then we don't have
to talk about it.

08:27.804 --> 08:28.771
All right.

08:31.608 --> 08:32.607
All right,
what did you buy?

08:32.642 --> 08:33.542
That's okay.

08:34.544 --> 08:36.679
I changed my mind.

08:36.712 --> 08:39.615
It's probably something you
shouldn't see until we get married.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.583
Oh. So, we're getting
married now?

08:41.618 --> 08:43.184
It's definite?

08:43.219 --> 08:46.255
Uh, yeah.
We agreed.

08:46.289 --> 08:48.123
There's definitely going to be
a wedding on the Fourth of July.

08:48.158 --> 08:49.291
So you keep saying.

08:49.326 --> 08:51.927
Oh, come on, get excited. I'm excited.

08:53.063 --> 08:54.997
Maybe I could get excited.

08:55.031 --> 08:57.733
What'd you buy? Some fancy
lingerie or something?

08:57.767 --> 08:59.068
Like we have the money for some
fancy lingerie or something.

08:59.102 --> 09:01.670
No! I bought

09:02.005 --> 09:03.672
a wedding dress.

09:03.707 --> 09:05.774
Really?
Really.

09:05.809 --> 09:07.676
And it's bad luck for the groom to
see the bride in the dress, so...

09:07.711 --> 09:09.645
So?

09:09.679 --> 09:12.348
We're living together. We're
already saying that we're married.

09:12.382 --> 09:13.549
Come on, show it to me.

09:13.583 --> 09:14.516
All right,
maybe I will.

09:14.551 --> 09:16.385
I'm really
excited about it.

09:16.419 --> 09:18.153
I'm excited about it.

09:28.031 --> 09:29.031
What is that?

09:29.065 --> 09:31.900
It's my wedding gown.

09:31.935 --> 09:35.971
I got it for $25 at a
thrift shop. Isn't it great?

09:36.006 --> 09:38.741
I mean, when it's cleaned up
and altered and everything.

09:38.775 --> 09:41.543
I could just tell it was such a
beautiful dress. And it's a Hara Dara.

09:41.578 --> 09:42.778
(CHUCKLES)
It's a what?

09:42.812 --> 09:44.713
A Hara Dara. She was
world famous at one time.

09:44.748 --> 09:46.715
And then she
made that dress?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.584
It's a great dress,
it is, I swear.

09:48.618 --> 09:52.287
She sold off her line,
but she was a genius.

09:52.322 --> 09:53.455
Really? Because

09:55.325 --> 09:58.093
I don't know anything
about wedding dresses,

09:58.128 --> 09:59.461
but I can tell you
with absolute certainty

09:59.496 --> 10:01.263
that is not
a great dress.

10:01.297 --> 10:03.165
Yes, it is.
You just have no vision.

10:03.199 --> 10:05.034
Oh, no,
I can see all right.

10:05.068 --> 10:07.970
It's dirty, it's too big, and it's used.

10:08.004 --> 10:11.874
So what? I can get it
cleaned up and made to fit

10:11.908 --> 10:14.043
and, you know, reuse,
recycle, it's totally me.

10:14.077 --> 10:15.744
I don't think
it's totally you.

10:15.779 --> 10:17.579
I love you,
but I hate that dress.

10:17.614 --> 10:19.581
Well, I like it.
I don't.

10:19.616 --> 10:21.450
I don't want you to wear
someone else's wedding dress.

10:21.484 --> 10:23.452
Well, I'm going to make
it into my wedding dress.

10:23.486 --> 10:25.387
You don't have to do that.
We'll buy you a brand new dress.

10:25.422 --> 10:27.623
I don't want a brand-new
dress. It's a waste of money.

10:27.657 --> 10:28.624
That's a waste of money.

10:28.658 --> 10:29.558
I don't care if
it was just $25.

10:29.592 --> 10:32.327
You wasted $25

10:32.362 --> 10:33.395
because you can't possibly
be serious about wearing that.

10:33.430 --> 10:36.298
It's ridiculous.

10:36.332 --> 10:38.967
Whoa. You can't tell me what dress
to wear and not to wear to my wedding.

10:39.002 --> 10:40.903
Oh, so it's your wedding
now, not our wedding?

10:40.937 --> 10:44.707
You didn't want any involvement
in it, other than to just show up,

10:44.741 --> 10:47.543
and now you want to tell
me what dress to wear?

10:47.577 --> 10:48.677
I don't think so.

10:48.712 --> 10:50.512
All right, all right,

10:50.547 --> 10:51.647
before we get
into a big fight here...

10:51.681 --> 10:53.348
Too late.

10:53.383 --> 10:55.284
Why don't you show it
to your friends

10:55.318 --> 10:56.452
and your mom and my moms
and see what they think?

10:56.486 --> 10:58.320
I don't care
what they think.

10:58.354 --> 10:59.488
I don't even care what you
think. I love this dress!

10:59.522 --> 11:01.323
No, you don't.

11:01.357 --> 11:03.992
You were trying to start an
argument. That dress is a joke.

11:04.027 --> 11:06.161
And you knew what I'd
think when you put it on.

11:06.196 --> 11:08.130
You're just trying to get out of
this wedding by causing a fight

11:08.164 --> 11:10.766
so you can blame me for the
whole thing falling apart.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.835
You're acting like an idiot
right now, you know that?

11:12.869 --> 11:13.836
Why would you think I'm going
to back out of the wedding now?

11:13.870 --> 11:16.905
Because you
bought that dress.

11:16.940 --> 11:17.606
I'm going for a walk.

11:35.425 --> 11:36.325
(SIGHS)

11:39.656 --> 11:40.857
Twenty-five dollars?
I love it!

11:40.891 --> 11:42.625
It's not just
about saving money.

11:42.659 --> 11:43.626
It's about saving
a beautiful dress.

11:43.660 --> 11:44.760
I don't know.

11:44.795 --> 11:46.596
I mean, I'm all
for recycling.

11:46.630 --> 11:47.663
I have a business
that pretty much revolves

11:47.698 --> 11:51.234
around reuse
and recycle, but...

11:51.268 --> 11:51.501
What do you think,
Willowdine?

11:52.536 --> 11:54.303
I'm with George.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.339
If you can do something
with a $25 dress, go for it.

11:56.373 --> 11:58.040
Never mind.

11:59.142 --> 12:00.176
Okay, you did
that with Nora.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.278
You're not doing
it with her, too.

12:02.312 --> 12:04.247
What'd he do? What's going
on? Did I do something?

12:04.281 --> 12:05.948
I'll just be changing.

12:05.983 --> 12:07.083
I'll help you.

12:09.820 --> 12:11.888
I like Nora.
Nora likes me.

12:11.922 --> 12:12.955
I can't help it.
I'm charming.

12:12.990 --> 12:14.690
Are you?
And funny.

12:15.592 --> 12:17.493
We'll see.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.561
By the way,
Nora's kind of upset

12:18.595 --> 12:19.495
that you're dating
Anne, you know.

12:20.731 --> 12:22.431
Why would she be upset?

12:22.466 --> 12:23.566
I don't know. Either
she's in love with Anne

12:23.600 --> 12:26.269
or she's in love
with you.

12:26.303 --> 12:27.570
Personally, I'd say that
you're the better catch,

12:27.604 --> 12:30.373
Anne being so new
to gay and all.

12:30.407 --> 12:31.340
Hasn't made
any difference so far.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.142
Really?
Really.

12:33.176 --> 12:34.243
And I think you're
mistaken about Nora.

12:34.278 --> 12:37.079
Do you? I mean,
you totally screwed up

12:37.114 --> 12:39.015
that AA meeting for her,
the gay one,

12:39.049 --> 12:41.083
'cause now she can't really talk about
her life or her feelings or anything

12:41.118 --> 12:42.184
because then you'll
go back and tell Anne.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.853
She said that?
Nora said that?

12:43.887 --> 12:46.756
No, I said that.
I'm quite astute.

12:46.790 --> 12:49.592
And right vow I'm astuting
that you're attracted to me.

12:49.626 --> 12:52.828
Wow. Anne was right.
You really are an idiot.

12:52.863 --> 12:54.630
Do you actually think that a
gay woman would sleep with you

12:54.665 --> 12:56.666
just because you'd
get a kick out of it?

12:56.700 --> 12:59.335
Apparently, a gay woman
slept with me for years

12:59.369 --> 13:01.504
just because I got
a kick out of it.

13:01.538 --> 13:03.439
Okay, you are funny.

13:03.473 --> 13:04.540
I will sleep with you.
Really?

13:05.309 --> 13:08.144
Never.

13:08.178 --> 13:08.411
Did I tell you that
he'd hit on you?

13:08.445 --> 13:11.113
Yep.

13:11.148 --> 13:13.149
Hey, before you run off to Kathleen's,
I have to ask you something.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.985
That guy David that I used to
go out with keeps texting me.

13:16.019 --> 13:18.087
And he said that he ran
into you a few months ago,

13:18.121 --> 13:19.121
and he's surprised that he
hasn't heard from either of us.

13:19.156 --> 13:21.857
Why is that?
I don't know.

13:21.892 --> 13:23.759
Give me his number. I'll call him
and tell him to stop bothering you.

13:23.794 --> 13:25.828
I can take care
of myself, thank you.

13:25.862 --> 13:26.629
I'm just going to wander
around, let you two talk.

13:28.865 --> 13:30.566
So, you saw David?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.401
I saw him.
I ran into him.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.502
Okay, so why didn't you
tell me you ran into him?

13:33.537 --> 13:35.504
Because.
Because why?

13:35.539 --> 13:37.540
Because I ran into him and his
two little girls. He has twins.

13:38.408 --> 13:40.476
Really?

13:40.510 --> 13:42.378
But David can't have
children. Did he adopt?

13:42.412 --> 13:44.313
He has children.
Biological children?

13:44.348 --> 13:45.281
I don't know.
Like I was going to ask?

13:45.315 --> 13:47.249
Well, I think I would ask.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.051
Who cares if he has
children? Don't we care?

13:49.086 --> 13:51.754
Why would we care?
Why?

13:51.788 --> 13:54.056
Because once we thought that
David was the father of Robie,

13:54.091 --> 13:55.891
only he couldn't have
children and you could.

13:56.994 --> 13:58.661
You are Robie's father?

13:58.695 --> 13:59.862
Of course I am!

13:59.896 --> 14:01.864
I told you I didn't
have a vasectomy.

14:01.898 --> 14:03.833
But that guy apparently lied about
not being able to have children.

14:03.867 --> 14:05.735
He's the bad guy, not me.

14:05.769 --> 14:07.637
What?
I'm Robie's father.

14:07.671 --> 14:08.671
I was there
when he was born.

14:08.705 --> 14:11.240
I've taken
good care of him.

14:11.274 --> 14:13.242
I've been here for him for the
past two years. I'm his father.

14:13.276 --> 14:14.377
Even if I'm not, so you
don't have to talk to David.

14:17.447 --> 14:20.049
Knock, knock.
Oh, come in.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.117
Oh, right. That's what
you should say to me.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.119
I didn't know
where else to go.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.287
George and Anne
were talking.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.922
It is feeling
a bit awkward.

14:26.957 --> 14:29.191
Mmm. Been there.

14:29.226 --> 14:32.061
So, how's it going
with your girlfriend?

14:32.095 --> 14:35.031
Oh, I don't know if
we should discuss that.

14:35.065 --> 14:36.899
It's not Daters Anonymous.

14:36.933 --> 14:39.535
I mean, just because
you're my AA sponsor

14:39.569 --> 14:41.704
doesn't mean we can't have a
normal, social conversation.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.374
You better be nice
to her, you know.

14:45.409 --> 14:46.442
I am nice to her.

14:46.476 --> 14:48.611
You better be.
I am.

14:48.645 --> 14:52.181
Why are you being
so protective?

14:52.215 --> 14:53.382
Why wouldn't I be?
Anne's my friend

14:53.417 --> 14:56.252
and she's my
son's mother-in-law.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.253
Is that it?

14:58.255 --> 15:00.156
Or do you like her?

15:00.190 --> 15:04.827
I like her. Of course I like
her. She's a really nice woman.

15:04.861 --> 15:07.730
Yeah, she is.
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:07.764 --> 15:07.830
But you know
what I mean.

15:10.801 --> 15:12.868
Do I?

15:12.903 --> 15:14.537
Doesn't seem like a normal
social conversation to me.

15:14.571 --> 15:15.671
Does it to you?

15:15.706 --> 15:16.839
Are you serious about her?

15:16.873 --> 15:18.808
I don't know yet.
Are you serious about her?

15:18.842 --> 15:21.377
Because for some reason,
George seems to think

15:21.411 --> 15:24.480
that you're either interested in
Anne or you're interested in me.

15:24.514 --> 15:28.350
George is an idiot. I think
we've already established that.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.185
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

15:29.219 --> 15:30.453
Hi, Nora.

15:30.487 --> 15:32.321
Hey, Anne.
Hey, Robie.

15:32.355 --> 15:33.355
Are you ready to go?

15:33.390 --> 15:36.092
Yeah, it's a really
long drive home.

15:36.126 --> 15:37.993
Are you okay?

15:38.028 --> 15:39.862
Yeah, I'm fine. I just
really want to get home.

15:39.896 --> 15:40.996
Don't worry about it.
I'll drive, sweetie.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.900
Good night, Nora.

15:44.935 --> 15:45.935
Good night.

15:48.605 --> 15:49.839
Sweetie. Ugh.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

15:58.548 --> 16:00.349
Hello?

16:00.383 --> 16:01.584
Is Amy still over there?
I don't know. Why?

16:01.618 --> 16:03.452
Did she show
you that dress?

16:03.487 --> 16:06.288
No, I didn't
want to see it.

16:06.323 --> 16:07.356
I didn't feel like hanging
out with Willowdine and Anne.

16:07.390 --> 16:10.226
Why not?

16:10.260 --> 16:12.394
They're at that obnoxious
stage in their relationship

16:12.429 --> 16:15.030
where they think they're in love
with each other or something.

16:15.065 --> 16:17.133
Did Amy show
you the dress?

16:17.167 --> 16:19.969
She showed me the dress. We had a
big fight and then I walked it off

16:20.003 --> 16:22.171
but when I got home
and apologized,

16:22.205 --> 16:24.874
<i>she took off and left
me with John again.</i>

16:24.908 --> 16:26.041
Not that I mind
being with John again,

16:26.076 --> 16:27.877
but I had to feed him
and put him to bed

16:27.911 --> 16:28.878
and she knows I've got
this placement test tomorrow.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.614
It's only 8:00.

16:31.648 --> 16:33.616
Yes, and then it's
only 9:00 and only 10:00

16:33.650 --> 16:35.618
and only 11:00
and then it's midnight.

16:35.652 --> 16:37.652
Then I have to sleep because
I've got this test tomorrow.

16:37.843 --> 16:39.066
Never mind.

16:57.774 --> 16:58.874
This is going to be fun.
Yeah.

16:58.908 --> 17:00.676
I can't wait to see it.
Yeah. Me too.

17:00.710 --> 17:03.478
You're not even
interested, are you?

17:03.513 --> 17:05.347
It's just that
every minute counts

17:05.381 --> 17:07.516
and this could be
a waste of time.

17:07.550 --> 17:10.519
It's not a waste of time. It's sharing
with our friends, making memories.

17:10.553 --> 17:13.387
It's just that it's time we
make our own memories, Grace.

17:13.423 --> 17:16.191
Life is short. Time
is very precious to me.

17:16.224 --> 17:18.226
I know, but like everyone
keeps reminding you,

17:18.261 --> 17:21.963
you're young. You're
going to live a long life.

17:21.998 --> 17:23.098
Yeah, and I want
to live it with you.

17:23.132 --> 17:25.867
To the fullest.
Each and every day.

17:25.902 --> 17:27.769
That's so sweet.

17:27.804 --> 17:28.837
And so near death experience.

17:30.807 --> 17:32.708
Let's just try
to enjoy life

17:32.742 --> 17:34.776
and not take every single
second so seriously.

17:34.811 --> 17:36.812
I mean, everything is going
to be fine. Everything is fine.

17:39.716 --> 17:41.583
I thought you were going to
show us your wedding dress.

17:41.617 --> 17:42.551
This is it.
This is my wedding dress.

17:42.585 --> 17:45.287
What do you think, Grace?

17:45.321 --> 17:46.621
It's gonna be altered
and cleaned, of course.

17:46.656 --> 17:49.424
It's just got
such great lines.

17:49.459 --> 17:52.394
I got it from a thrift store.
Grace, it's a Hara Dara.

17:52.428 --> 17:54.362
Are you kidding?
No.

17:54.397 --> 17:56.465
Are you sure it's
not a fake Hara Dara?

17:56.499 --> 17:59.201
Are you sure it's not part
of a burka or something?

17:59.235 --> 18:01.269
Jack, no. It's a one of a kind
dress from a very famous designer.

18:01.304 --> 18:05.107
Amy, God is good. Marriage
is a union made by God.

18:05.141 --> 18:07.809
You have to honor the sacred
commitment you're about to make.

18:07.844 --> 18:08.977
For a second time.

18:09.011 --> 18:12.748
Uh, yeah, Jack,
I know that,

18:12.782 --> 18:14.983
but I don't have to spend a lot
of money in order to do that.

18:15.017 --> 18:16.585
I love this dress.

18:16.619 --> 18:18.553
Yeah. It's unique.

18:18.588 --> 18:19.788
Amy, life is short and
each moment is precious.

18:19.822 --> 18:23.458
Do you want to spend
the moments of your life,

18:23.493 --> 18:25.627
nay, our lives,
in that dress?

18:25.661 --> 18:26.628
"Nay"?

18:26.662 --> 18:28.363
You don't get it,
but you'll see.

18:28.397 --> 18:32.167
It's going to be
a beautiful dress.

18:32.201 --> 18:35.170
And you're all going to be so
shocked to see how it comes out.

18:42.044 --> 18:43.879
(WHISPERS) Holy cow!
She's lost her mind!

18:43.913 --> 18:45.714
I cannot believe it!
I wonder what Ricky thinks.

18:45.748 --> 18:46.882
I know.

18:46.916 --> 18:50.852
Oh, dear Lord,
I have turned into a girl.

18:50.887 --> 18:54.523
I've been here so long I'm your girlfriend
now. I'm gossiping. I'm whispering.

18:55.625 --> 18:59.461
Who are you texting?
Who else?

18:59.495 --> 19:01.429
Amy, Adrian wants
you to drop by.

19:01.464 --> 19:02.631
She's dying to
see your dress.

19:06.536 --> 19:09.271
I thought it was bad luck for the groom
to see the dress before the wedding.

19:09.305 --> 19:10.372
You're not the groom.

19:10.406 --> 19:12.174
She says she showed Ricky.

19:12.208 --> 19:14.075
They're already married.
It doesn't count.

19:14.110 --> 19:15.877
Plus, I'm dying to see it.

19:15.912 --> 19:17.078
Grace says it's hideous.

19:17.113 --> 19:18.146
How hideous could
a wedding dress be?

19:19.048 --> 19:21.850
Oh, wow!

19:21.884 --> 19:24.820
Oh, you guys.
You just don't get it.

19:24.854 --> 19:27.722
It's a great dress. It just
needs to be fixed up a little bit.

19:27.757 --> 19:29.558
No, I wasn't saying
anything negative.

19:29.592 --> 19:32.627
I just meant,
"Oh, wow, isn't that a... "

19:32.662 --> 19:34.462
I told you you could
wear my dress.

19:34.497 --> 19:35.697
You'll just
have to take it up.

19:35.731 --> 19:39.267
Wear the dress you wore
to marry her old boyfriend?

19:39.302 --> 19:41.536
Oh, so what?
It's better than...

19:41.571 --> 19:45.173
Going to all the expense, time
and trouble to patch that up.

19:45.208 --> 19:48.143
I want to go to the expense,
time and trouble to patch this up.

19:48.177 --> 19:50.212
And I want everyone
to see it now

19:50.246 --> 19:52.113
because you're all going
to be totally blown away

19:52.148 --> 19:53.081
when you see it
again at the wedding.

19:53.115 --> 19:55.817
Isn't that a Hara Dara?

19:55.852 --> 19:57.886
Yeah!
What?

19:57.920 --> 19:59.054
I've helped out
at a lot of weddings.

19:59.088 --> 20:01.790
You know,
my mom marries people.

20:01.824 --> 20:04.559
I know a dress label, a wedding
dress designer. Doesn't make me gay.

20:04.594 --> 20:05.594
No, that doesn't
make you gay, but...

20:06.662 --> 20:08.496
Okay.

20:08.531 --> 20:10.699
You know dress designers,
wedding dress designers,

20:10.733 --> 20:13.501
but you don't know that your
furniture looks like crap in here?

20:13.536 --> 20:14.669
No, it doesn't.
Yes, it does.

20:14.704 --> 20:18.340
This is yours?
Yes, this is mine.

20:18.374 --> 20:19.474
And it's comfortable and I
just bought it a year ago,

20:19.508 --> 20:22.210
so I don't want
to get rid of it.

20:22.245 --> 20:23.411
You bought it from
a thrift store.

20:23.446 --> 20:24.379
Oh, yeah.
That's where I got this.

20:24.413 --> 20:25.413
A Hara Dara?
Yeah.

20:25.448 --> 20:27.048
No way.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.084
Stop. Right now.

20:29.118 --> 20:32.120
Really, you don't want to wear someone
else's wedding dress that you don't know.

20:32.154 --> 20:34.789
You know me. Wear my
dress. Ben won't care.

20:34.824 --> 20:35.957
This isn't about Ben.

20:35.992 --> 20:37.759
Besides, I really think
this one will work.

20:37.793 --> 20:39.861
Who cares who
it belonged to, it's...

20:39.896 --> 20:41.863
It's a nice dress

20:41.898 --> 20:42.797
and it'll make a good story to
tell your kids when you grow up.

20:43.599 --> 20:44.566
What?

20:44.600 --> 20:46.534
You said,
"When you grow up. "

20:46.569 --> 20:48.470
You mean, "When
your kids grow up. "

20:48.504 --> 20:51.439
Did I say that? I didn't mean
that. You're plenty grown up.

20:51.474 --> 20:53.508
And I think it's admirable that
you're doing what you're doing.

20:53.542 --> 20:56.244
Yeah, you don't have to spend a
lot of money to have a nice wedding.

20:56.279 --> 20:57.379
No, I meant
it's admirable

20:57.413 --> 20:59.180
that you and Ricky
are getting married,

20:59.215 --> 21:01.082
or I guess I should say
you and Ricky got married,

21:01.117 --> 21:02.284
and you're raising
your son together.

21:02.318 --> 21:03.318
Thank you.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.122
Um, I'm just gonna

21:07.156 --> 21:08.189
get changed.
It's getting late.

21:08.257 --> 21:10.191
I should be
getting home.

21:12.028 --> 21:14.863
That's exactly
what she did.

21:14.897 --> 21:16.698
The admirable thing
and now she's stuck.

21:16.732 --> 21:17.666
What?

21:19.869 --> 21:22.570
I think she wishes
she hadn't married Ricky.

21:22.605 --> 21:24.739
I think she regrets it and now
she's stuck having a wedding

21:24.774 --> 21:26.574
and she's not going to spend
money on a wedding dress

21:26.609 --> 21:28.476
because it's not going
to be her last wedding.

21:28.511 --> 21:31.279
And look, I'm not saying that
because I wish it didn't last.

21:31.314 --> 21:32.247
I mean, I wish them both nothing
but love, peace and happiness,

21:32.281 --> 21:35.450
but I can tell.

21:35.484 --> 21:39.120
Something is wrong.
Something is very wrong.

21:39.155 --> 21:41.289
That dress reflects her feelings
about her union with Ricky.

21:41.324 --> 21:43.291
(CHUCKLES) I think someone's
taking freshman psychology

21:43.326 --> 21:46.161
a little too seriously.

21:46.195 --> 21:47.896
And someone knows just a little
bit too much about wedding dresses.

21:47.930 --> 21:49.965
You say Hara Dara,
I say hari-kari.

21:49.999 --> 21:52.634
She's on a suicide mission.
She wants out.

21:54.637 --> 21:55.603
Well, she'll be
going out in style.

22:08.317 --> 22:09.284
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

22:14.490 --> 22:16.324
(CHUCKLES)

22:21.931 --> 22:23.932
Please, please,
let me go with you.

22:23.966 --> 22:25.100
You can't.

22:25.134 --> 22:27.035
Please don't make me
say that to you again.

22:27.069 --> 22:28.803
There's no
point in going.

22:28.838 --> 22:31.773
They'll just say no and
it'll make me upset and angry.

22:31.807 --> 22:34.576
It's hard enough
to say goodbye now.

22:34.610 --> 22:36.511
Think about how much
harder it will be

22:36.545 --> 22:37.779
if my parents are yelling at
you to get out of our house.

22:37.813 --> 22:39.681
So this is it?

22:39.715 --> 22:42.450
We say goodbye here
and that's the end of it?

22:42.485 --> 22:45.353
There's no end to it, really.

22:45.388 --> 22:48.189
I'll always have
wonderful memories of you

22:48.224 --> 22:50.258
and I hope that we
can always be friends.

22:50.292 --> 22:52.027
Friends for life.

22:52.061 --> 22:53.161
Friends for life
stay together for life

22:53.195 --> 22:55.964
and get married
and have children.

22:55.998 --> 22:58.967
I don't know if I'll ever want to
be married and have children, okay?

22:59.001 --> 23:02.737
So, please,
just say good night.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.938
And I'll talk to you
when I get home.

23:03.973 --> 23:04.839
All right, then.

23:05.808 --> 23:06.641
Good night.

23:16.787 --> 23:18.654
You're out-voted.
The dress is fine.

23:52.923 --> 23:53.956
Good night.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.596
If you had a problem with
this, why didn't you say so?

24:00.630 --> 24:02.665
Oh, I had a problem
with it all right,

24:02.699 --> 24:05.434
because I know
where that came from.

24:05.469 --> 24:07.236
She gave it
to me for Christmas.

24:07.270 --> 24:08.537
Apparently, I had left it
when I got moved out

24:08.572 --> 24:12.208
of the house we were in
together and she kept it.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.077
Yeah, she kept it for all of those
years because she's in love with you.

24:16.179 --> 24:18.147
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

24:18.181 --> 24:21.083
I saw it, I got angry
about it and then I left.

24:21.118 --> 24:22.785
I'm not angry
about it anymore.

24:22.819 --> 24:26.655
I'm not angry about
anything, so good night.

24:26.690 --> 24:27.923
And if I'm
angry about anything,

24:27.958 --> 24:29.625
I should just leave it
alone and say good night?

24:32.896 --> 24:36.599
You insulted me and my
choice in bridal gowns,

24:36.633 --> 24:38.467
you doubt my commitment to
want to get married to you

24:38.502 --> 24:41.504
and then I find a gift
from a childhood friend

24:41.538 --> 24:43.472
which probably means

24:43.507 --> 24:46.175
you're the one who has
doubts about marrying me.

24:47.177 --> 24:49.078
But I'm letting it go,

24:49.112 --> 24:51.080
so whatever you're angry
about, just let it go.

24:51.114 --> 24:54.083
I don't want to let it go. I don't
want to just sweep it under the rug.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.084
I wasn't hiding
that trophy from you.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.886
It was right
there on the shelf.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.888
Yeah.
Hiding in plain sight.

24:58.922 --> 25:01.657
I put it there the day she gave it
to me and then I forgot about it.

25:01.691 --> 25:04.560
It wasn't that important.
It's not sentimental to me.

25:04.594 --> 25:06.762
I don't care about Clementine
in the way I care about you.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.664
You're my wife and
the mother of my child.

25:08.698 --> 25:12.468
You seem to keep forgetting
that I'm not your wife.

25:12.502 --> 25:15.204
Amy, I'm telling
you right now

25:15.238 --> 25:17.073
if you are not going through
with this wedding, I want to know.

25:17.107 --> 25:18.174
I don't want
to drag this out.

25:18.208 --> 25:20.176
Let's just get it
out in the open.

25:20.210 --> 25:21.243
Let's tell everyone we're not
married and we're not getting married

25:21.278 --> 25:22.011
if that's how you feel.

25:24.948 --> 25:27.016
But it's not, Ricky.

25:27.050 --> 25:29.885
I got really excited
about the wedding,

25:29.920 --> 25:31.854
maybe for the first time,
when I saw that dress.

25:31.888 --> 25:33.856
I just got this
picture in my mind

25:33.890 --> 25:37.760
of how beautiful
it's going to be.

25:37.794 --> 25:40.663
And how nice it's going to be
to finally be officially married

25:40.697 --> 25:43.766
soso there's no doubt
that we love each other

25:43.800 --> 25:47.536
and that we are
raising our son together

25:47.571 --> 25:51.307
and that we are committed to
making this work for a lifetime.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.376
I love hearing you say that.
I just wish I believed it.

25:54.411 --> 25:58.147
Because I'm sensing
a lot of doubt.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.049
Yeah, well, that's
your problem, Ricky.

26:00.083 --> 26:02.017
That's not my problem,
so goodnight.

26:08.125 --> 26:11.727
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

26:11.761 --> 26:13.729
Hey, can I come in?
I saw your light on.

26:13.763 --> 26:15.631
Yeah, come in.

26:15.665 --> 26:16.665
Can't sleep again?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.833
I sleep in the daytime.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.702
Still can't sleep
at night, huh?

26:19.736 --> 26:21.470
I'm working on it.

26:21.505 --> 26:22.471
Yeah, well, you're back
to school tomorrow,

26:22.506 --> 26:24.440
so you're going
to need the sleep.

26:24.474 --> 26:26.575
What's on the phone?

26:26.610 --> 26:30.379
Amy has purchased a dress
for the upcoming wedding.

26:30.413 --> 26:31.347
Let me see.

26:33.450 --> 26:35.251
You are seeing. That's it.

26:35.285 --> 26:37.253
Maybe I need glasses.
Can you blow it up?

26:37.287 --> 26:39.054
It looks like a rag.

26:39.089 --> 26:41.023
Yeah, she looks
like Miss Havisham.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.925
Who's Miss Havisham?

26:42.959 --> 26:44.994
Ugh. I hate that look!

26:45.028 --> 26:47.863
It's a "how can you not know
who Miss Havisham is" look!

26:47.898 --> 26:49.798
It's a reference to
something at school, isn't it?

26:49.833 --> 26:51.000
<i>It's from Great Expectations.
The hair place?</i>

26:51.034 --> 26:55.671
No, the novel?
By Charles Dickens.

26:55.705 --> 26:59.608
Miss Havisham is this wealthy
spinster who looks like a witch.

26:59.643 --> 27:01.610
You know what? It wasn't
even a good analogy.

27:01.645 --> 27:03.679
Now you want to tell me
what an analogy is?

27:03.713 --> 27:06.615
It's a comparison of sorts.
I'm sorry.

27:06.650 --> 27:09.285
I just hate feeling
stupid. I hate school.

27:09.319 --> 27:12.354
You're not stupid.
You're far from stupid.

27:12.389 --> 27:14.390
So, why is she wearing a
rag for a wedding dress?

27:14.424 --> 27:17.993
I don't know. She got
it at the thrift store

27:18.028 --> 27:19.929
and that's what she
wants to get married in,

27:19.963 --> 27:21.897
or she wants to make it into something
she can get married in, anyway.

27:21.932 --> 27:24.066
Yeah, well, I guess since
they're already married,

27:24.100 --> 27:26.035
it's not that big a deal, this wedding.

27:26.069 --> 27:28.871
Uh, we'll see.

27:28.905 --> 27:30.606
So, you don't think
they're married?

27:30.640 --> 27:32.575
Or you don't think they'll
get married again?

27:32.609 --> 27:34.710
What? No.
I didn't say that.

27:34.744 --> 27:36.478
That I don't think they're married.
Or that they won't get married again.

27:36.513 --> 27:37.546
Your face said that.
No, it didn't.

27:37.581 --> 27:38.581
Uh-huh, it did.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.349
No, it didn't.

27:40.383 --> 27:41.550
And why do you think
you can just read my face?

27:41.585 --> 27:44.587
Survival skill.
I can read any guy's face.

27:44.621 --> 27:48.190
So, what's going on?

27:48.225 --> 27:49.325
She's not really
married, is she?

27:49.359 --> 27:50.359
She's married.

27:53.263 --> 27:55.130
I can read Amy's face, too. And?

27:55.165 --> 27:59.802
And her face says sometimes
when you have to live your life

27:59.836 --> 28:01.804
according to what
other people want or need,

28:01.838 --> 28:02.938
sooner or later,
you crack.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.609
You better try
to get some sleep, huh?

28:06.643 --> 28:07.843
You're kicking me out?

28:07.877 --> 28:10.679
Have to. I have
to get some sleep.

28:10.714 --> 28:12.615
That's going to be
difficult for you

28:12.649 --> 28:13.716
now that you know that I
know that Amy's not married.

28:13.750 --> 28:17.453
Uh... Yes, she is.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.320
"Uh, uh, uh. "

28:23.260 --> 28:25.194
Good night.

28:25.228 --> 28:27.396
You say "uh" when you get
nervous, you know that?

28:34.938 --> 28:36.238
Hi, husband.

28:36.273 --> 28:38.941
Hi, wife. Are you coming up to bed soon?

28:38.975 --> 28:41.010
No, you go ahead. I didn't
get to read the paper today.

28:41.044 --> 28:43.078
And Chloe is still
wandering the house?

28:43.113 --> 28:45.648
Yeah.

28:45.682 --> 28:46.649
All right, well,
goodnight. I love you.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.617
I love you, too.

28:48.652 --> 28:50.719
Do me a favor,

28:50.754 --> 28:51.754
say goodnight to Ben and see
if she's still in his room.

28:51.788 --> 28:53.622
Okay, and if she is?

28:53.657 --> 28:55.457
She isn't.
She's right here.

28:57.594 --> 29:01.330
I'm not going to try to have sex
with Ben, if that's what you think.

29:03.466 --> 29:04.533
Night.

29:06.403 --> 29:08.437
Is that what you think?

29:08.471 --> 29:11.340
No, that's not what I
think. You still can't sleep?

29:11.374 --> 29:14.043
I haven't slept in years.
I don't really need to sleep.

29:15.011 --> 29:16.979
And no, I can't sleep.

29:17.013 --> 29:19.114
Nightmares? Afraid that
guy's gonna show up?

29:19.149 --> 29:21.984
He won't show up.
You're safe here.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.955
Ah. It's school, isn't it?

29:26.990 --> 29:28.857
School starts
again tomorrow.

29:28.892 --> 29:32.528
I hate school.
I'm like two years behind

29:32.562 --> 29:35.798
and it would be three, but then they'd
have to put me back in middle school.

29:35.832 --> 29:38.667
And they certainly don't want
any hookers in the middle school.

29:38.702 --> 29:41.503
Certainly not.
(CHUCKLES)

29:41.538 --> 29:44.473
Come on, sit down, read the
paper to put you to sleep.

29:44.507 --> 29:46.308
Sit down
and read the paper.

29:46.343 --> 29:49.044
Look up anything
you don't understand

29:49.079 --> 29:51.013
and you'll be smarter than anyone
else at that school, guaranteed.

30:40.196 --> 30:42.965
Amy Juergens
isn't really married.

30:44.868 --> 30:46.769
Guess that's why Ben's
been acting so crazy.

30:53.689 --> 30:55.457
Yo. Chloe.

30:55.491 --> 30:57.359
You got 20 minutes
to get ready for school.

30:57.393 --> 30:59.394
Huh? Looks like you got some sleep.

30:59.428 --> 31:01.363
But you got to get a
shower, change clothes,

31:01.397 --> 31:03.198
grab something
for breakfast

31:03.232 --> 31:05.233
and you've only got
20 minutes to do it.

31:05.267 --> 31:07.402
Maybe I'll just wait until
tomorrow, go back then.

31:07.436 --> 31:09.337
Then you'll be a day
behind. Come on, let's go.

31:09.372 --> 31:12.273
I'm already behind. Years.

31:12.308 --> 31:15.143
I can take you or Dad can
take you. It's up to you.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.911
And not a word about what you
think you can read on my face.

31:25.087 --> 31:26.788
So, is she up?

31:26.822 --> 31:28.657
Yeah, I told her
she had 20 minutes,

31:28.691 --> 31:29.758
which I'm sure will
turn into a half hour.

31:31.794 --> 31:34.796
So, ready to get
back to school?

31:34.830 --> 31:38.466
Are you kidding? Yeah. The sooner
we get back, the sooner I get out.

31:38.501 --> 31:40.502
Six months of high
school left and counting.

31:40.536 --> 31:42.604
You should really make the most
out of those months, you know.

31:42.638 --> 31:44.506
Enjoy yourself.
Have a good time.

31:45.541 --> 31:48.309
But not too good a time?

31:48.344 --> 31:50.211
Don't do anything illegal,
but have a good time.

31:50.246 --> 31:51.413
Make the most
out of those months.

31:51.447 --> 31:53.281
I'll give it a shot,

31:53.315 --> 31:54.349
in between trying
to keep my grades up

31:54.383 --> 31:57.886
and hoping for more
choices with college...

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
(STAMMERS)

31:58.954 --> 32:01.022
What is wrong with you?
Nothing.

32:01.057 --> 32:03.825
Just want you to get off to
a fresh start to a new year.

32:03.859 --> 32:05.927
And you know what else?

32:05.961 --> 32:07.028
We should start planning
something for the summer.

32:07.063 --> 32:08.930
Your last summer before
you go off to college.

32:08.964 --> 32:10.932
Maybe you should think
about going back to Italy,

32:10.966 --> 32:14.502
using that as a home base to
see as much of Europe as you can.

32:14.537 --> 32:16.538
Well, maybe for
part of the summer.

32:16.572 --> 32:18.673
Oh? What are you going
to do with the other part?

32:18.708 --> 32:21.476
I don't know. I guess I'd want to
be here for Amy and Ricky's wedding.

32:21.510 --> 32:25.480
Huh? Why you want to be here for that
when you could be in London or Paris?

32:25.514 --> 32:28.550
After all these years of watching
those two go back and forth,

32:28.584 --> 32:31.152
no, I want to be there.

32:31.187 --> 32:33.254
What if you stick around and they
change their minds or something?

32:33.289 --> 32:34.422
You would have
wasted your time.

32:34.457 --> 32:36.324
They won't
change their mind.

32:36.358 --> 32:38.359
Amy bought a wedding dress this weekend.

32:38.394 --> 32:41.196
Good. Good for Amy.

32:41.230 --> 32:43.131
And you know that how?

32:43.165 --> 32:45.133
Word gets around. I better
go get ready for school.

32:45.167 --> 32:48.069
But thank you for the offer to
travel next summer, sounds good.

32:52.708 --> 32:53.775
Okay, we're leaving.

32:55.711 --> 32:57.579
All right.

32:57.613 --> 32:59.581
Have a good day.

32:59.615 --> 33:01.516
Thanks. You, too.

33:03.652 --> 33:04.519
Bye, John.
Bye.

33:07.389 --> 33:09.591
Okay, I'm sorry.

33:09.625 --> 33:11.559
I don't know why I care
what dress you wear.

33:11.594 --> 33:13.561
You wear any dress you want,
including the scary one.

33:13.596 --> 33:16.397
It won't be scary
when I'm finished with it.

33:16.432 --> 33:18.233
Hey, if you can make
a man out of me,

33:18.267 --> 33:21.069
you can make a dress
out of that pile of rags.

33:21.103 --> 33:22.403
I didn't make a man out of you, you did.

33:23.439 --> 33:25.140
And you're
a very nice man

33:25.174 --> 33:27.108
and you're going to make
a wonderful husband.

33:27.143 --> 33:29.911
You're already
a wonderful father.

33:29.945 --> 33:31.980
I can't believe we fell into
fighting about the wedding.

33:32.014 --> 33:35.984
It's just 50 people eating in my
parents' backyard on the Fourth of July.

33:36.018 --> 33:39.020
And whether we said I do or not
the last time we had a wedding,

33:39.088 --> 33:40.622
I already feel
married to you.

33:42.625 --> 33:43.858
And are you happy
being married to me?

33:43.893 --> 33:44.726
Of course I am.

33:45.628 --> 33:46.661
I am.

33:50.733 --> 33:52.333
I'll see you tonight.

33:52.368 --> 33:53.635
Okay, have a good day.

34:30.906 --> 34:32.806
Hey, nice dress
you picked out.

34:32.842 --> 34:33.875
Thanks for the picture.

34:33.909 --> 34:34.876
I don't know
why I did that.

34:34.909 --> 34:37.779
Or I do know
why I did that.

34:37.813 --> 34:41.616
I was angry at Ricky so I went to
show all of my friends and family

34:41.650 --> 34:45.520
what a great dress I had found and
absolutely no one agreed with me,

34:45.554 --> 34:47.589
except for maybe Omar.

34:47.623 --> 34:49.324
Doesn't matter. I was
just looking for sympathy

34:49.358 --> 34:50.558
and for someone
to be on my side,

34:50.592 --> 34:55.096
and you've always been on my
side, so I sent that picture.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.398
And if my husband knew,
he'd be very upset with me,

34:57.433 --> 35:00.101
and I couldn't bring
myself to tell him,

35:00.135 --> 35:03.171
not last night, not this morning,
but I am going to tell him.

35:03.205 --> 35:06.174
And I already told him that
you don't think we're married,

35:06.208 --> 35:08.009
so I really screwed up.

35:08.944 --> 35:10.078
You're not married.

35:10.112 --> 35:13.748
I might as well be.
And I'm going to be.

35:13.782 --> 35:15.717
I don't know
why I'm not happy.

35:15.751 --> 35:17.919
Because you're tired
of doing the right thing.

35:17.953 --> 35:20.889
You're tired of doing what
everyone else wants you to do

35:20.923 --> 35:21.589
and you just
want to run away.

35:21.857 --> 35:24.826
Yeah.

35:24.860 --> 35:26.761
You know,
the stupid thing is that

35:26.795 --> 35:28.763
I imagine most moms feel
that way from time to time,

35:28.797 --> 35:32.634
and it should be okay for me to
feel that way every once in a while,

35:32.668 --> 35:35.470
to have doubts,
to want more,

35:35.504 --> 35:38.273
to question whether or not
this is all there is to life.

35:40.175 --> 35:42.176
I love Ricky.

35:42.211 --> 35:44.279
I'm just afraid of failing.

35:44.313 --> 35:47.348
I'm afraid of our marriage
failing, of him leaving me,

35:47.383 --> 35:49.317
or even worse,

35:49.351 --> 35:51.286
that I'll leave him and then
regret it for the rest of my life.

35:53.255 --> 35:55.823
Thank you, Ben,
for being my friend.

35:57.092 --> 35:59.894
And for even being
obsessed with me

35:59.929 --> 36:01.029
between girlfriends
and wives.

36:01.063 --> 36:03.998
It's made me feel good
about myself somehow

36:04.033 --> 36:06.834
and if you never
find anyone else, Ben,

36:06.869 --> 36:09.804
then I'll really, really have regrets
about even talking to you, so...

36:09.838 --> 36:12.807
I hope that
you do find someone.

36:12.841 --> 36:13.808
You deserve someone, Ben.

36:21.383 --> 36:24.319
Kathy's at the airport.
She's leaving.

36:24.353 --> 36:26.254
I offered to go with her
to talk to her parents

36:26.288 --> 36:29.190
and beg them
to let her stay,

36:29.224 --> 36:30.325
but she wouldn't
leme do that.

36:31.193 --> 36:32.293
Any advice?

36:32.328 --> 36:34.228
Yeah. Let's go.

36:34.263 --> 36:35.396
I'll drive you
to the airport

36:35.431 --> 36:38.032
and you run to that plane
as fast as you can

36:38.067 --> 36:39.167
and you tell her
how much you love her

36:39.201 --> 36:41.169
and how you'll
never let her go,

36:41.203 --> 36:43.137
unless it becomes
uncomfortable for her

36:43.172 --> 36:45.073
or feels more like
stalking or something,

36:45.107 --> 36:47.742
and then you go to her parents
and you state your case.

36:47.776 --> 36:48.977
And if that doesn't work,
you go back,

36:49.011 --> 36:50.778
and then you
go back again

36:50.813 --> 36:52.847
until no one doubts that
you love this woman

36:52.881 --> 36:54.882
and want to be with her
for the rest of your life!

36:54.917 --> 36:57.585
What time's the flight?

36:57.619 --> 36:59.244
I think it's in an hour. I
never canceled the reservation.

36:59.279 --> 37:00.358
Let's go!

37:04.224 --> 37:05.641
I knew this is going to happen.
I knew it!

37:06.024 --> 37:06.990
I knew it the second I laid my
eyes on those evil, blonde twins.

37:07.025 --> 37:08.892
I knew it was trouble.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.627
You really think there's
a possibility, George?

37:10.662 --> 37:11.762
Yeah, I do think
there's a possibility.

37:11.796 --> 37:12.830
And you never thought
there was a possibility

37:12.864 --> 37:14.631
that David was
the father before?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.600
I told you. He said
he couldn't have children.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.569
I should have known he was
lying. I should have known!

37:18.603 --> 37:20.571
I mean, Anne and I are brunettes.
We've only had brunettes.

37:20.605 --> 37:21.839
Anne is a redhead.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.674
Like I said,
Anne and I are brunettes.

37:23.708 --> 37:24.575
George. (CHUCKLES)

37:24.609 --> 37:26.743
Robie's a blonde.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.413
Brown, brown, blonde. There
are no brown, brown, blondes.

37:29.447 --> 37:31.548
Brown is dominant. Two
browns don't make a blonde.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.683
It's brown, brown, brown, not
brown, brown, blonde. Ever.

37:32.717 --> 37:33.617
No, it's possible.
It's totally possible.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.519
Brown, brown, blonde.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.488
My mom and dad, brown, brown,
and I was blonde as a kid.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.490
Huh?
Chaz Bono.

37:39.524 --> 37:42.459
Sonny, brown, Cher,
brown, me, blonde as a kid.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.394
Yeah, well, I hate to bring
this up, but Gregg Allman?

37:46.297 --> 37:47.231
You sure?

37:51.035 --> 37:52.236
Blonde or brunette,
I still love him.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.238
He's my son and no one is
taking him away from me.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.808
Aw.

37:57.842 --> 38:02.112
Apparently, my first wife was having
an affair with our fertility doctor.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.947
I paid a lot of money
for a lot of lies.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.917
And when did you find out
that you could have children?

38:06.951 --> 38:08.619
You remember my assistant?

38:08.653 --> 38:09.853
The one who hated me?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.722
I married her.
When she got pregnant.

38:11.756 --> 38:14.558
With twins.
And yes, they are mine.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.761
And that's why I'm here.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.563
Robie is not your son.

38:19.597 --> 38:21.698
He could be.
He looks like mine.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.401
And it never occurred to you
before you ran into George

38:24.435 --> 38:26.436
to contact me when you found
out that you can have children?

38:26.471 --> 38:28.405
George seemed absolutely
sure that the baby was his

38:28.439 --> 38:30.407
and you both seemed
absolutely sure

38:30.441 --> 38:33.377
that you never
wanted to see me again.

38:33.411 --> 38:36.113
And I've kind of
been caught up

38:36.147 --> 38:39.149
in some legal stuff with my
first wife and her husband,

38:39.184 --> 38:41.218
the aforementioned
fertility doctor.

38:41.252 --> 38:45.289
As well as caught up with
starting a family and being a dad.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.991
I like being a dad.
I'm a good dad.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.961
Please. You have your girls.
Just leave us alone, David.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.163
George is Robie's father.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.933
Anne, you don't really
think I can do that, do you?

38:55.967 --> 38:59.002
Just leave it alone?
I can't.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.738
But I am going to give you
some time to get a DNA test.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.740
It's really easy,

39:03.775 --> 39:04.942
and after you
get that test,

39:04.976 --> 39:07.711
hopefully in the next
few weeks, then call me.

39:07.745 --> 39:09.846
And if I don't?

39:09.881 --> 39:12.683
If you don't, then I'm going to
ask for the test through the courts.

39:12.717 --> 39:14.785
But I know you, Anne.
You're a good woman

39:14.819 --> 39:16.553
and you're going to want
to know the truth, too.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.821
I just... (SIGHS)

39:17.855 --> 39:19.590
I can't believe this.

39:19.624 --> 39:22.659
Hey, you and I
were totally careless.

39:22.694 --> 39:26.697
If Robie is my son, he probably
happened on our first date,

39:26.731 --> 39:29.333
same thing happened to your
daughter and her boyfriend.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.367
Husband.
They got married.

39:31.336 --> 39:32.536
Good for them.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.338
Guess that's out
of the question for us.

39:36.241 --> 39:37.241
That's not funny.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.243
Look, if Robie is my son,

39:39.277 --> 39:41.345
I want to be
involved in his life

39:41.379 --> 39:44.047
and that means that you and I are
gonna be involved in each other's lives,

39:44.082 --> 39:48.085
so let's get this process
started as soon as possible

39:48.119 --> 39:50.954
and let's try and
keep it amicable.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.924
I've been nothing but good to
you, Anne, and you know that.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.960
Even when you and George
were not so nice to me.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.228
I think you're getting a
little ahead of yourself.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.864
/CMaybe I am,
but I've got a feeling.

40:04.202 --> 40:07.004
You're giving it
back to me. Why?

40:07.038 --> 40:09.072
It was really nice of you
to give this to me.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.742
It was really thoughtful.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.677
And I was shocked
that you even had it,

40:13.711 --> 40:14.945
that you'd kept it
for all those years,

40:14.979 --> 40:17.781
but I feel funny
about taking it.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.616
Oh. Okay.

40:19.651 --> 40:20.717
But it's not the only
one I have, you know.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.818
I have a few of them.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.754
I didn't know.

40:23.788 --> 40:26.556
So, do you mind returning
it to the collection, then?

40:26.591 --> 40:29.559
No, happy to keep
the complete

40:29.594 --> 40:30.727
Ricky baseball
trophy collector set.

40:30.762 --> 40:35.532
And you're keeping
all my trophies because?

40:35.600 --> 40:40.504
Because of all the crummy
childhood memories I have,

40:40.538 --> 40:41.605
you're the only nice one.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.474
What can I get you?

40:44.509 --> 40:46.510
Nothing. Thanks.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.578
I think I'm going
to quit drinking coffee

40:48.613 --> 40:49.379
before it becomes
dangerous to my health.

40:51.549 --> 40:52.516
See you around, Clementine.

40:53.685 --> 40:54.685
I'll be here.

41:07.632 --> 41:10.734
Hi.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.437
It's your lucky day. Your ticket
is being upgraded to first class.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.705
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right.

41:14.739 --> 41:15.739
Are you Kathy?

41:17.575 --> 41:18.709
Yeah?
Right this way.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.583
Did my dad do this
or something?

41:26.617 --> 41:28.685
Or something.
If you could take your seat,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.587
we're trying to close the
door so we can be on our way.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.429
If you'd rather have
the window seat...

41:39.464 --> 41:40.530
What are you doing?

41:40.565 --> 41:42.432
I'm going home with you.

41:42.467 --> 41:44.468
These seats are compliments
of Ben Boykewich,

41:44.502 --> 41:48.405
although I strongly suspect the
Sausage King is footing the bill.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.707
Ethan, I can't believe you did this!

41:50.742 --> 41:54.344
I wanted you to do something
like this, but it was just

41:54.379 --> 41:57.414
unfair for me to ask, or
to even want you to do this.

41:57.448 --> 41:59.483
Look, I'm going
to take my best shot

41:59.517 --> 42:00.684
and if it
doesn't work out,

42:01.753 --> 42:02.586
I'll keep shooting.
