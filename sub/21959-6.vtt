WEBVTT

00:04.656 --> 00:06.242
Previously on Bad Blood...

00:06.414 --> 00:08.203
- You know who I am, right?
- Yes.

00:08.257 --> 00:11.050
You're gonna receive bids for the
east end snow removal contract,

00:11.119 --> 00:12.251
and these four companies

00:12.320 --> 00:13.663
are who you're gonna give the bid to...

00:13.687 --> 00:15.186
I want every file on snow removal

00:15.255 --> 00:17.523
contracts in the city
and surrounding areas.

00:17.591 --> 00:20.281
These boys have
been terrorizing my son.

00:20.423 --> 00:21.890
You said you'll work for me.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.007
My mom... She left when I was six.

00:26.116 --> 00:27.395
My old man hooks up with this woman.

00:27.419 --> 00:28.484
She was a junkie.

00:28.509 --> 00:30.441
She said, "Get rid of 'em."

00:30.466 --> 00:32.366
Your father gave his kids away?

00:33.140 --> 00:34.817
They're coming at us from all sides.

00:34.841 --> 00:37.075
Don't you dare try to blame my son.

00:37.144 --> 00:38.820
- You understand?
- Yes.

00:38.845 --> 00:42.880
Yes, boss! Whatever it takes
to remind you of your place.

00:42.905 --> 00:44.171
Yes, boss.

00:44.291 --> 00:45.761
Vito is coming back to a shit storm.

00:45.785 --> 00:46.843
Do you get that?

00:46.868 --> 00:48.188
He doesn't wanna see you, Declan.

00:48.254 --> 00:49.234
What?

00:49.259 --> 00:50.351
You failed me.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.842
I know Nico wasn't easy.

00:51.867 --> 00:53.632
But I left you in charge.

00:54.148 --> 00:55.195
Sal's here.

00:55.220 --> 00:57.148
- Well, who's Sal?
- Sal Montagna.

00:57.173 --> 00:58.672
Acting head of the Bonanno family.

00:58.845 --> 01:00.445
They wanted our action for years.

01:00.470 --> 01:02.704
Vito will cut your head
off if he finds you.

01:02.799 --> 01:05.767
Vito is not gonna be
doing much of anything.

01:05.945 --> 01:08.145
His organization
is going to fall apart.

01:09.727 --> 01:11.393
They tried to wipe out the family.

01:12.786 --> 01:14.586
Including you. You're one of us.

01:14.836 --> 01:16.281
We gotta find out who's talking.

01:16.306 --> 01:18.771
I say, from now on, only you, me and Gio

01:18.796 --> 01:20.206
know the dropoff points.

01:20.275 --> 01:21.708
It was Gio. It was him.

01:23.412 --> 01:24.677
Glad you're on our side.

01:24.746 --> 01:26.281
Are you ready to be a king?

01:29.045 --> 01:30.257
Absolutely.

02:06.487 --> 02:09.148
There's a lot of myths
surrounding wine.

02:09.826 --> 02:12.160
People think wine gets better with age,

02:12.265 --> 02:13.742
that's actually bullshit.

02:14.547 --> 02:16.581
Wine is a living thing.

02:16.830 --> 02:19.564
And like all things
that live, it breeds,

02:19.632 --> 02:23.734
it matures, it can become
more robust or turn sour.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.249
It's all about timing.

02:26.522 --> 02:28.322
The right bottle at the right time

02:28.641 --> 02:30.842
takes its rightful place in history.

02:35.682 --> 02:37.281
- Thank you.
- Who's this guy?

02:37.350 --> 02:38.683
I need a new driver.

02:38.821 --> 02:39.954
I'll get you a new driver.

02:40.542 --> 02:41.671
He seems all right.

02:42.151 --> 02:43.450
Who referred him?

02:43.622 --> 02:44.648
Leclair.

02:44.705 --> 02:48.351
When I find some time, we'll sit
down and I'll think about it.

02:51.097 --> 02:52.195
I...

02:52.621 --> 02:54.288
I have to take care of some stuff.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.632
Do you need anything?

02:55.875 --> 02:56.937
Anything?

02:57.468 --> 02:58.468
No.

03:01.305 --> 03:03.062
What's so special about the bottle?

03:03.867 --> 03:06.810
I bought it at an auction
when Nico was born.

03:08.664 --> 03:10.930
I was going to share it
with him on his birthday.

03:15.037 --> 03:16.289
I'm going to get going.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.046
God damn it.

03:40.851 --> 03:42.545
You got the wrong place, pal.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.046
I did not order a pizza.

03:44.248 --> 03:45.273
Funny.

03:45.298 --> 03:47.498
I didn't know if there'd be
any place to eat out here.

03:48.039 --> 03:49.453
Little House on the Prairie.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.210
It's a nice property you've got.

03:53.492 --> 03:55.031
What's with the shit barn?

03:58.785 --> 04:00.785
You think you get golf on this thing?

04:00.810 --> 04:01.810
Look at it.

04:04.003 --> 04:05.402
Come on...!

04:06.603 --> 04:07.769
This is amazing.

04:09.688 --> 04:10.804
Hey...

04:11.136 --> 04:12.949
I'm thinking of bringing
up some reinforcements

04:12.973 --> 04:14.101
from New York.

04:14.424 --> 04:15.492
Quietly.

04:16.654 --> 04:17.834
But...

04:18.202 --> 04:21.031
I don't want to risk them
getting popped at customs,

04:21.055 --> 04:22.656
so I'm going to need hardware from you.

04:22.864 --> 04:23.929
No problem.

04:24.088 --> 04:25.630
When this happens,
it's going to happen fast

04:25.654 --> 04:26.920
and it's going to happen hard.

04:26.989 --> 04:28.355
Close to the finish line,

04:28.424 --> 04:29.968
this is where we separate
the winners from the losers.

04:29.992 --> 04:32.093
I don't need a halftime speech, Sal.

04:32.161 --> 04:34.289
Just trying to do a little
bonding here, you know.

04:35.049 --> 04:37.182
This attitude of yours
is not very endearing.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.062
I was going to say get comfortable,

04:39.087 --> 04:41.755
but I get it. New Yorkers
have their own speed.

04:42.009 --> 04:43.601
I'm going to go take a leak.

04:43.939 --> 04:46.156
Carry on. Just making myself at home.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.406
I think we should do Vito
at the Candy Shop.

04:53.741 --> 04:55.341
I hate that goddamn place.

04:55.441 --> 04:56.840
Why can't he meet at a strip club

04:56.865 --> 04:58.179
like everybody else?

05:06.970 --> 05:08.421
Let's get some pizza.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.492
God damn it!

05:38.273 --> 05:40.117
God damn it!

05:40.994 --> 05:42.250
You rat piece of shit!

06:26.371 --> 06:28.242
Declan, Declan, please.

06:28.570 --> 06:31.304
Please, please, please.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.426
Please, what do you want?

06:33.799 --> 06:34.960
What do you want?

06:36.153 --> 06:37.919
I won't make you beg, Sal.

06:37.944 --> 06:39.226
You turned on me.

06:40.218 --> 06:42.140
You worthless piece of sh...

07:09.492 --> 07:10.824
For the past 15 years,

07:10.894 --> 07:13.527
the same five companies
have won snow removal bids

07:13.596 --> 07:16.263
for the entire city and
surrounding municipalities.

07:16.331 --> 07:18.632
They don't even bother
to change their bids

07:18.701 --> 07:20.801
from year to year to fix the prices.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.197
I could prosecute these companies on

07:22.209 --> 07:23.548
collusion just off these patterns.

07:23.572 --> 07:25.817
They really don't pay as close
attention to covering their tracks

07:25.841 --> 07:28.039
for snow removal
as they do for construction.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.778
- Hey, that's good.
- I know.

07:30.929 --> 07:32.429
What's this man's name again?

07:32.835 --> 07:34.015
Marc Desjardins.

07:34.182 --> 07:35.848
He's in charge of, um,
receiving contracts

07:35.918 --> 07:37.382
and doling out bids.

07:37.914 --> 07:40.753
Okay, let's go over everything one
more time before we bring him in.

07:40.822 --> 07:42.210
We've been over it 10 times.

07:42.789 --> 07:45.125
I let you have candy for
breakfast, and you're whining.

07:45.193 --> 07:46.804
- You let me have it?
- Yeah.

07:46.962 --> 07:47.976
Jeanne?

07:48.496 --> 07:50.140
Could you pick up lunch
for everyone, please?

07:50.164 --> 07:51.326
Grilled salmon and salad.

07:51.351 --> 07:52.703
- For yourself, too.
- Sure.

07:53.789 --> 07:55.296
Why are you ordering lunch for us?

07:55.320 --> 07:56.488
Because your diet is terrible.

07:56.512 --> 07:58.160
It's going to effect
your mental stamina.

07:58.203 --> 07:59.605
Omega 3s are good for your mind.

07:59.674 --> 08:01.741
If you ever tell me to drop
and give me 20, I'm quitting.

08:01.765 --> 08:02.945
Don't be silly.

08:03.257 --> 08:04.776
You could never do 20 pushups.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.019
Hi. They're bringing someone in.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.101
Marc Desjardins.

08:16.223 --> 08:17.223
Hi, Marc.

08:18.351 --> 08:19.351
Remember me?

08:20.453 --> 08:22.914
Listen, something's come up.

08:23.530 --> 08:25.770
And I'm going to need you to
listen to me very carefully.

08:25.833 --> 08:28.359
And don't say anything
until I'm done, okay?

08:30.070 --> 08:31.871
You're going to be
brought in for questioning.

08:32.655 --> 08:35.340
They're going to ask you about those
fixed snow removal contracts.

08:35.408 --> 08:37.028
- You're going to admit to it.
- What?

08:37.053 --> 08:39.119
Don't talk until I'm done.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.539
You're going to get charged.

08:45.531 --> 08:47.710
But there's a good chance you
won't get any time in jail

08:47.734 --> 08:49.354
because you're going
to cooperate fully.

08:49.422 --> 08:50.632
But if you do,

08:51.187 --> 08:53.391
only two years, you'll
serve about eight months.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.187
- But you...
- No, no, no. Don't talk.

08:55.465 --> 08:56.562
Don't talk.

08:58.695 --> 09:00.495
We're going to take care
of your family, Marc.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.299
School, bills...

09:02.368 --> 09:03.834
We'll pay off your mortgage.

09:03.903 --> 09:06.554
And when you get out,
if you do serve time in jail,

09:06.710 --> 09:08.338
we're going to find you a new job.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.168
Because you won't be allowed to
work for the government anymore.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.851
Take a breath.

09:19.413 --> 09:20.546
Now you can talk.

09:23.632 --> 09:25.522
- I'm going to jail.
- Hopefully not.

09:25.590 --> 09:28.024
Yeah, I I won't go to...

09:29.884 --> 09:30.884
Sit.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.504
Marc.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.578
Marc, you're a decent guy.

09:35.171 --> 09:36.179
I like you.

09:36.453 --> 09:37.796
But let's cut the bullshit.

09:38.584 --> 09:39.750
You took money

09:40.031 --> 09:42.648
to do illegal things
and now you've been caught.

09:42.841 --> 09:44.473
Okay, so just stop the wishful thinking

09:44.542 --> 09:46.429
and let's deal with the situation.

09:46.744 --> 09:49.703
We take care of our friends

09:49.978 --> 09:52.812
as long as you remain a friend.

09:54.976 --> 09:56.078
Now listen to me.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.039
This is what's going to happen,

09:58.200 --> 09:59.906
and this is what you're going to say.

10:09.390 --> 10:11.414
Hey. I thought you had a meeting.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.492
I did, but, um...

10:13.894 --> 10:15.827
I have a headache so I came back.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.240
You okay?

10:18.923 --> 10:20.423
Yeah, fine.

10:32.655 --> 10:33.655
Yeah?

10:38.289 --> 10:39.328
It's done.

10:39.596 --> 10:40.765
You got problems?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.343
- Nah.
- Did he see it coming?

10:43.633 --> 10:45.332
Not for a second.

10:46.803 --> 10:48.135
Grab a piece.

10:48.335 --> 10:49.492
And the other thing?

10:49.960 --> 10:52.304
- Mr. Desjardins.
- Nothing to worry about.

10:54.156 --> 10:57.242
Hey. Let's have a drink, yeah?

11:33.625 --> 11:35.031
We won. Vito.

11:35.701 --> 11:37.000
We won.

11:42.142 --> 11:43.507
What is it?

11:46.609 --> 11:48.953
I sent the new guy
out to get me a puzzle.

11:49.163 --> 11:50.764
And I told him to throw away the box

11:50.789 --> 11:52.453
so now I don't know what it is.

11:55.226 --> 11:57.328
- What...
- When Nico was a kid,

11:58.004 --> 12:00.004
he did the same thing
and threw away the box.

12:00.073 --> 12:02.265
And we sat there for
like about two months.

12:02.709 --> 12:05.544
You know, trying to do it,
it was nothing.

12:05.710 --> 12:07.250
Nothing, nothing...

12:07.656 --> 12:08.746
And then,

12:08.815 --> 12:11.343
finally, you know,
you get the right piece

12:12.585 --> 12:14.218
snapped into place

12:14.382 --> 12:15.987
and you see the whole landscape.

12:16.056 --> 12:17.476
It was like...

12:17.869 --> 12:19.351
Like a revelation.

12:20.851 --> 12:22.671
I was teaching him a life lesson.

12:23.203 --> 12:24.726
About patience,

12:25.077 --> 12:26.335
tenacity,

12:26.974 --> 12:28.226
work ethic...

12:31.036 --> 12:33.504
When it all came together, I mean,
I don't think I'd ever seen

12:33.573 --> 12:35.734
anybody that excited in my life.

12:37.076 --> 12:39.750
Hey! Hey! I
didn't hear you come in.

12:39.945 --> 12:41.609
Didn't know you were here.

12:42.215 --> 12:43.280
Hi.

12:43.349 --> 12:44.481
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:45.695 --> 12:46.717
Hey.

12:46.785 --> 12:48.384
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.453
- What is this?
- A puzzle.

12:51.210 --> 12:53.045
It's a puzzle,
Vito's good at puzzles.

12:53.851 --> 12:56.398
I used to love doing
puzzles when I was a kid.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.062
- Where's the box?
- No box.

13:00.062 --> 13:01.764
- You're doing it blind?
- Yeah.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.266
I like a challenge.

13:03.335 --> 13:04.579
All right, then. You're in.

13:04.603 --> 13:06.536
- You gotta help me.
- I'm going to go.

13:06.671 --> 13:08.170
All right, thanks, Declan.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.031
Anything, boss. See you.

13:10.908 --> 13:12.703
So you take the, um...

13:13.296 --> 13:15.978
You take the light bits,
I'll take the dark bits.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.140
Okay.

13:20.539 --> 13:21.890
Monsieur Desjardins,

13:22.796 --> 13:25.437
as you can see, there's a
pretty clear pattern here.

13:25.689 --> 13:28.210
I have to say I'm shocked
at the laziness of it all.

13:29.493 --> 13:31.250
We have your finances too, Marc.

13:33.898 --> 13:36.042
You live a pretty modest life,
but you know there are things

13:36.066 --> 13:37.532
you can't afford on your salary.

13:38.875 --> 13:39.945
I, um...

13:40.836 --> 13:42.135
I took... I took money.

13:45.048 --> 13:46.180
For what, exactly?

13:46.894 --> 13:48.560
I took money to give...

13:50.013 --> 13:52.156
City contracts to companies.

13:53.210 --> 13:56.450
Each year they would show me a
list of which companies were...

13:56.519 --> 13:58.219
Were supposed to get the jobs.

13:58.484 --> 13:59.687
Who gave you the list?

14:00.157 --> 14:01.589
It was always a...

14:01.614 --> 14:03.679
A different person and I, I, um...

14:04.268 --> 14:06.320
I never knew their names.

14:10.232 --> 14:11.965
Did they give you the list on paper?

14:12.265 --> 14:14.804
They would show me the list
and I had to memorize it.

14:15.471 --> 14:17.242
Did you ever meet Vito Rizzuto?

14:18.589 --> 14:19.589
No.

14:20.529 --> 14:21.929
Did his name ever come up?

14:22.507 --> 14:23.523
No.

14:24.046 --> 14:25.979
I... I mean, I've heard of him.

14:26.048 --> 14:27.247
You know, from the...

14:27.316 --> 14:28.949
From the newspapers or whatever.

14:32.804 --> 14:35.388
I can't believe that year after
year, a stranger would come

14:35.457 --> 14:37.457
and you would know exactly what to do.

14:40.095 --> 14:42.359
But the first time
they approached you...

14:44.164 --> 14:45.984
Must have been someone important.

14:46.643 --> 14:48.443
The one who set up the arrangement.

14:51.578 --> 14:52.960
Did they threaten you, Marc?

14:54.250 --> 14:56.351
Because if they threatened
you, I can help you here.

14:57.059 --> 14:59.335
You did this against your own will.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.901
I don't want to go to jail.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.406
I can't guarantee that.

15:03.918 --> 15:06.195
If you don't give me a name,
I guarantee you will.

15:08.589 --> 15:09.984
This is serious, Marc.

15:10.491 --> 15:12.591
You can get charged for every year

15:12.660 --> 15:15.609
and every company
you gave contracts to.

15:15.863 --> 15:17.329
Off the top of my head...

15:17.414 --> 15:19.374
You got 50 years right there.

15:24.605 --> 15:25.605
What's the name?

15:27.832 --> 15:28.898
Sal Montagna.

15:41.453 --> 15:43.131
The body of Sal Montagna

15:43.155 --> 15:46.428
alleged boss of New York's
Bonanno crime family

15:46.453 --> 15:49.454
was found in the waters
by the Old Port today.

15:49.522 --> 15:52.190
He'd been reportedly shot several times.

15:52.258 --> 15:55.414
Montreal police have not given a
statement other than they say...

15:55.439 --> 15:57.808
We finally get a name, and
he turns up dead the next day.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.750
- What are the chances?
- Wake up, Guy.

16:00.855 --> 16:02.120
That's no coincidence.

16:02.164 --> 16:04.115
Sal Montagna, a New York boss,

16:04.140 --> 16:06.000
has been controlling our city works?

16:06.565 --> 16:07.664
No.

16:07.963 --> 16:09.730
He was told to give us that name.

16:09.907 --> 16:11.441
So he knew we were coming.

16:11.533 --> 16:12.533
How?

16:14.367 --> 16:16.195
There's always leaks.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.640
You can never plug them all.

16:20.087 --> 16:21.093
So, what next?

16:21.281 --> 16:24.115
We are very grateful for the
testimony we've already received

16:24.184 --> 16:26.752
from individuals from the
private and the public sectors,

16:26.821 --> 16:28.954
exposing corruption and collusion.

16:29.022 --> 16:32.859
Whistleblowing must no longer
be seen as an act of betrayal.

16:32.953 --> 16:34.516
Will you be releasing those names?

16:34.540 --> 16:35.606
No, not yet.

16:35.766 --> 16:36.921
What have they said?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.795
What I can say at this
time, is that this

16:39.820 --> 16:41.756
runs through all levels
of our government.

16:41.781 --> 16:42.844
Which firms are implicated?

16:42.868 --> 16:44.828
And we are going to
uncover every person who

16:44.853 --> 16:46.679
participates in stealing
from our citizens.

16:46.704 --> 16:49.024
Does this go all
the way to the mayor's office?

16:49.522 --> 16:51.154
That's all the time I have for today.

16:51.223 --> 16:52.531
I must get back to work.

17:32.945 --> 17:34.476
It's been a while, Vito.

17:35.312 --> 17:37.566
Easy, Jacques. This place stinks.

17:37.635 --> 17:39.835
We had a birthday party last night,

17:40.160 --> 17:41.781
and things got a little crazy.

17:42.184 --> 17:44.593
What, so crazy you
couldn't piss in a toilet?

17:45.028 --> 17:46.362
Come on, let's bring it outside.

17:46.387 --> 17:48.835
Why, so someone can shoot
me from the bushes?

17:49.320 --> 17:51.032
- That's funny, Vito.
- Can you see that, Jacques?

17:51.056 --> 17:54.007
Him, running away from 100
bikers with those shoes?

17:54.275 --> 17:55.828
They're 1,000 bucks each.

17:56.117 --> 17:59.118
If I stand here for two more
seconds, I'm going to start puking.

17:59.225 --> 18:00.804
Yeah, no offense, Jacques.

18:03.646 --> 18:04.726
It stinks.

18:07.131 --> 18:08.539
So what do you want, Vito?

18:10.379 --> 18:13.429
I originally came to you
as a businessman.

18:14.578 --> 18:17.773
But the minute I went down,
you came at me as a gangster.

18:18.666 --> 18:20.054
You want gangster?

18:20.522 --> 18:21.593
You got it.

18:22.671 --> 18:24.578
No more syndicate, no more partnership.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.007
From now on, it's just me.

18:26.752 --> 18:29.960
A couple phone calls, I can
shut off your entire supply.

18:31.044 --> 18:34.179
Then I can start a federal investigation
against your organization.

18:34.626 --> 18:36.125
Take me a couple minutes.

18:38.669 --> 18:41.403
You want to know the reason
I keep you around?

18:43.605 --> 18:45.372
'Cause you're useful to me

18:46.239 --> 18:48.072
as a cow is to a farmer.

18:50.658 --> 18:51.914
You understand?

18:56.384 --> 18:57.384
Yeah.

19:05.484 --> 19:07.046
I gotta tell you, Jacques.

19:09.852 --> 19:11.171
You got a nice property here.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.867
If you ever get sick
of living in that shithole,

19:15.573 --> 19:17.187
I'll build you something nice.

19:20.799 --> 19:22.799
Don't move! Don't move!

19:22.984 --> 19:24.418
Do not move.

19:26.149 --> 19:27.149
My guy,

19:27.856 --> 19:29.122
or my 100 guys.

19:29.176 --> 19:31.109
They'll shoot every single one of you,

19:31.185 --> 19:33.281
if you so much as even shift.

19:41.321 --> 19:42.421
Martin, right?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.023
You the second in command?

19:48.128 --> 19:50.359
Congratulations.
You just got a promotion.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.226
I hope my terms
and conditions are acceptable.

19:58.518 --> 19:59.518
Yeah.

20:00.196 --> 20:01.196
Good.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.851
Let's get out of here.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.218
It's me and my father.

20:30.884 --> 20:32.132
It's a great picture.

20:32.477 --> 20:35.414
I met your father. Years ago.
How's he doing?

20:36.677 --> 20:39.978
He's had a bit of heart
trouble recently,

20:40.003 --> 20:42.023
but he's doing better now.

20:42.048 --> 20:43.062
Good.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.195
- You work here fulltime?
- No.

20:45.818 --> 20:47.250
Just got into law school.

20:48.109 --> 20:50.021
But I deferred for a semester

20:50.090 --> 20:52.054
to help my father out while he rests.

20:55.182 --> 20:56.343
Law school.

20:56.935 --> 20:59.953
That's really, really nice what
you're doing for your father.

21:01.131 --> 21:03.565
It's nothing compared
to what he's done for me.

21:04.843 --> 21:06.617
Um, I...

21:07.023 --> 21:09.197
Need to go check
what the lunch specials are.

21:09.409 --> 21:10.409
Um...

21:10.476 --> 21:11.851
Do you need cream or sugar?

21:28.224 --> 21:30.093
- Did you hear?
- What?

21:30.188 --> 21:31.687
The mayor's taking a few days off.

21:31.732 --> 21:34.218
My guy on the inside said he's
probably going to resign.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.560
Let's see how it plays out.

21:35.605 --> 21:36.961
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

21:37.439 --> 21:39.085
I got somebody else.

21:39.367 --> 21:41.812
A city engineer who says
that he accepted bribes

21:41.837 --> 21:43.857
to sign off on overinflated
construction budgets.

21:43.882 --> 21:45.574
- Fantastic.
- How many is that now?

21:45.599 --> 21:47.062
That's five, just today.

21:47.351 --> 21:49.826
You were right. We got
people running scared.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.802
And when we're done, we'll
have cleaned it all up.

21:51.826 --> 21:53.164
We never clean it all up.

21:53.617 --> 21:55.484
We just put a nice shine
on it for a while.

21:55.806 --> 21:56.905
Nice job.

22:01.062 --> 22:02.491
The mayor of Montreal

22:02.560 --> 22:04.760
has had enough of
the corruption allegations

22:04.829 --> 22:06.421
surrounding City Hall,

22:06.470 --> 22:08.304
and surrounding him.

22:08.589 --> 22:11.578
Gerald Tremblay announced
he's stepping down.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.205
Whoa!

22:38.689 --> 22:39.929
Take it easy.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.753
Yeah? What do you want?

22:44.778 --> 22:45.778
Hi, Lonnie.

22:47.448 --> 22:48.448
Who are you?

22:49.565 --> 22:50.929
Do you not recognize me?

22:51.478 --> 22:54.578
Well, if I recognize you, I'm
not going to go, "Who are you?"

22:55.688 --> 22:56.718
Who are you?

23:00.664 --> 23:01.830
Holy shit.

23:08.243 --> 23:09.243
Wanna come in?

23:23.439 --> 23:25.438
- Leave it, just leave it.
- Yeah, all right.

23:27.148 --> 23:29.656
I heard you're a bigtime gangster.

23:30.010 --> 23:32.117
- Where did you hear that?
- You're a big shot.

23:32.603 --> 23:33.945
Seen it in the papers.

23:34.283 --> 23:35.609
I thought you were in the joint.

23:36.085 --> 23:37.383
Got out a long time ago.

23:38.620 --> 23:39.687
That's good.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.125
Where you living now?

23:48.575 --> 23:50.541
- What?
- Where are you living?

23:52.081 --> 23:53.681
- Montreal.
- That's good.

23:55.089 --> 23:56.121
Thank you.

24:08.717 --> 24:10.483
Nice car you're driving there.

24:10.638 --> 24:11.640
Yeah.

24:11.699 --> 24:13.414
It's yours?

24:13.976 --> 24:16.984
Well, me, I'm still the same old guy,

24:17.009 --> 24:18.898
I'm sitting here waiting for a check.

24:19.780 --> 24:22.656
My welfare check has
got to come soon because

24:23.261 --> 24:26.031
sink went haywire,
of course I had to fix it.

24:26.578 --> 24:29.567
And the dude wants a couple
or 300 more from me,

24:29.636 --> 24:32.437
so I got nothing until Wednesday.

24:33.102 --> 24:35.092
It's pretty rough,
so I don't know if you...

24:35.763 --> 24:37.265
Would you consider maybe...

24:38.203 --> 24:39.656
Peeling off a couple?

24:40.311 --> 24:42.411
Helping me out, your old man, with a...

24:42.436 --> 24:44.359
With a few bucks? Is it possible?

24:47.753 --> 24:48.785
Wow.

24:48.810 --> 24:50.743
Probably 10 or 15 grand in here.

24:50.768 --> 24:52.304
I make that in an afternoon.

24:52.538 --> 24:54.004
But, no, I got nothing for you.

24:54.065 --> 24:55.132
What?

24:57.506 --> 25:00.195
You show up out of nowhere

25:01.306 --> 25:04.473
and you're going to talk to me
like a goof, you little shit?

25:06.546 --> 25:07.867
What do you want, boy?

25:08.157 --> 25:09.234
What do you want?

25:13.329 --> 25:14.562
What I wanted

25:15.453 --> 25:16.718
was to find you.

25:17.755 --> 25:19.023
So I hired someone.

25:19.584 --> 25:21.083
Didn't take very long.

25:22.151 --> 25:24.257
It's funny that you're here.

25:24.681 --> 25:26.820
And I control
all the drugs in this town.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.429
Yeah, it's funny. Ironic.

25:32.425 --> 25:33.617
Hey, Lonnie.

25:34.885 --> 25:36.101
You don't mind, do you?

25:36.667 --> 25:37.687
Lonnie.

25:37.712 --> 25:39.779
I think you should
really listen to this part.

25:39.978 --> 25:41.304
I got in touch

25:41.568 --> 25:43.101
with my distributors.

25:43.186 --> 25:44.984
And I said to them that no one,

25:45.491 --> 25:46.757
and I mean no one,

25:47.355 --> 25:50.125
is to ever sell you drugs again.

25:50.499 --> 25:52.465
If they do, they're dead.

25:53.281 --> 25:54.625
And if I hear,

25:55.152 --> 25:57.218
about anyone in this shithole town,

25:57.255 --> 25:59.756
who buys drugs for you, they're dead.

26:00.855 --> 26:02.804
As of now, you're cut off, Lonnie.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.734
What? Why?
What are you trying to do?

26:08.448 --> 26:11.781
What... What is your
plan here? Is it to get me clean?

26:12.101 --> 26:13.234
You want to get me clean?

26:13.259 --> 26:14.579
You want to save the day?
Is that it?

26:14.603 --> 26:16.303
You a big shot coming here...

26:16.456 --> 26:17.968
Well, you listen to me, now.

26:18.586 --> 26:19.937
I don't want to get clean.

26:20.808 --> 26:22.942
Certainly not for an old
piece of shit like you.

26:22.967 --> 26:24.093
Get clean?

26:26.550 --> 26:27.710
I'm not here

26:28.368 --> 26:30.054
to help you get clean, Lonnie.

26:31.251 --> 26:33.000
I'm here to help you suffer.

26:34.013 --> 26:35.212
You gave us up.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.303
Your children.

26:39.734 --> 26:40.851
You gave us up.

26:40.876 --> 26:42.437
You gave up me, and my beautiful

26:42.449 --> 26:44.367
little sister, so you could get high.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.312
You're not going to score anymore.

26:50.921 --> 26:52.087
Just stay here.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.882
Because you're broke, can't leave.

26:54.386 --> 26:58.555
Hell is going to start when
you burn through your stash.

26:58.655 --> 27:00.588
And if you ever do get clean,

27:00.649 --> 27:02.616
then I'll help you blow your brains out

27:02.679 --> 27:04.283
when you realize what an incredible

27:04.352 --> 27:06.031
piece of shit you really are.

27:09.550 --> 27:12.031
You are a horrible,

27:12.727 --> 27:14.393
horrible waste of life.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.539
Come on, little boy!

27:33.476 --> 27:35.156
You're probably still pissing

27:35.423 --> 27:36.823
your goddamn pants!

27:37.017 --> 27:38.148
Come on back!

27:38.273 --> 27:39.656
Come here and deal with me,

27:39.681 --> 27:42.593
I'll cut you over every which
way, you piece of shit!

27:43.124 --> 27:44.923
Go on, little boy!

27:47.401 --> 27:49.034
We should go on vacation.

27:49.753 --> 27:51.054
Dominican Republic.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.505
No.

27:53.609 --> 27:56.301
Every time we go there, you
either play golf the whole time,

27:56.369 --> 27:57.935
- or do business.
- No.

27:58.004 --> 28:01.070
This time, no golf, no meetings.

28:02.023 --> 28:03.835
We just rent a little cabana,

28:04.334 --> 28:07.602
we eat a lot, we drink too
much, we sleep in the sun.

28:08.101 --> 28:09.109
You know...

28:09.282 --> 28:10.414
A real vacation.

28:10.482 --> 28:11.849
- Yeah, a real vacation.
- Really?

28:11.918 --> 28:13.492
Yeah, I won't even bring my phone.

28:14.239 --> 28:15.906
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

28:17.056 --> 28:18.566
It would be good, come on.

28:18.590 --> 28:19.756
Hang on.

28:22.428 --> 28:23.428
Yeah.

28:25.282 --> 28:26.548
All right.

28:27.917 --> 28:29.390
Give me a couple minutes.

28:30.502 --> 28:31.609
Sorry, babe.

28:32.820 --> 28:34.578
We found him a mile from a crime scene.

28:34.603 --> 28:36.069
Two hours north of the city.

28:36.274 --> 28:37.359
Six bodies.

28:37.543 --> 28:39.031
Now, City Hall's all over this.

28:39.056 --> 28:41.609
Twentyfourhour security and no
one's allowed to talk to him.

28:42.098 --> 28:43.631
Vito, I pulled a lot of favors to get

28:43.643 --> 28:45.062
you five minutes alone with him.

28:46.502 --> 28:48.054
Why should I go talk to him?

28:49.754 --> 28:53.323
He dragged himself a mile
in the ground, bleeding to death.

28:54.959 --> 28:56.953
First thing he said to me
when I saw him was...

28:58.028 --> 28:59.601
He needed to talk to you.

29:01.332 --> 29:03.000
He's probably going to die, Vito.

29:04.904 --> 29:06.078
Very soon.

29:08.285 --> 29:09.984
Maybe you should hear him out.

29:32.328 --> 29:33.398
Vito?

29:33.881 --> 29:35.023
What's going on?

29:36.299 --> 29:38.732
- You going to invite me in?
- Yeah, come in.

29:39.067 --> 29:40.166
Yeah.

29:47.634 --> 29:49.066
- Drink?
- Yeah.

29:54.652 --> 29:56.835
You never invited me over,
you know that.

29:57.719 --> 29:59.385
Because I always go to you.

30:13.364 --> 30:14.734
You got no pictures.

30:15.003 --> 30:16.201
Family, friends.

30:17.805 --> 30:19.789
You know, milestones.

30:20.233 --> 30:21.699
Not a picture guy.

30:35.554 --> 30:36.562
Vito.

30:37.019 --> 30:38.203
You all right?

30:41.962 --> 30:44.703
I've been trying to figure out
where I went wrong.

30:47.217 --> 30:48.950
About how I got here.

30:52.008 --> 30:53.898
I keep thinking back to that night.

30:54.639 --> 30:57.206
Nico's birthday, before I was arrested.

31:00.313 --> 31:02.093
We were taking photos, and...

31:03.069 --> 31:04.301
I stood back

31:05.802 --> 31:07.536
and I saw my whole family.

31:09.319 --> 31:10.601
From my parents

31:10.884 --> 31:13.312
to my grandkids in a house

31:13.498 --> 31:14.864
that I built.

31:15.661 --> 31:17.406
And in that exact moment,

31:19.808 --> 31:21.632
I wanted for nothing.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.158
The people that killed my father,

31:33.673 --> 31:34.705
my son...

31:36.379 --> 31:38.646
Nothing would ever be enough for them.

31:40.838 --> 31:43.273
For that kind of person,
it's not about power,

31:43.521 --> 31:44.654
or money...

31:46.639 --> 31:48.272
For that kind of person,

31:50.094 --> 31:52.710
it's about a life of filling a hole

31:53.703 --> 31:55.235
that has no bottom.

32:10.324 --> 32:11.664
Gio's still alive.

32:12.150 --> 32:13.523
What?

32:15.986 --> 32:17.601
We finished the job,

32:19.192 --> 32:20.382
and then he shot me.

32:23.956 --> 32:25.507
You were a snitch, Gio.

32:26.764 --> 32:27.764
No.

32:28.638 --> 32:30.117
No.

32:34.261 --> 32:35.593
I could never.

32:38.064 --> 32:39.718
Is that what he told you?

32:42.679 --> 32:44.079
Mr. Rizzuto,

32:45.870 --> 32:48.438
how can you even think
something like that about me?

32:51.410 --> 32:53.531
You were the only one
who knew the dropoff points.

32:55.357 --> 32:56.690
But you know me.

32:58.141 --> 33:00.500
I would never do anything
like that to you.

33:01.797 --> 33:03.163
You gotta believe me.

33:08.265 --> 33:10.445
When I was laying
out there in the woods,

33:10.890 --> 33:12.497
I thought I was going to die.

33:14.609 --> 33:17.944
But, I thought, "No, I can't."

33:21.661 --> 33:24.148
So I crawled back to you.

33:25.968 --> 33:27.117
I crawled

33:27.707 --> 33:29.453
because I wasn't going to die,

33:30.659 --> 33:32.592
before I could tell you...

33:43.024 --> 33:44.218
Tell me what?

33:45.963 --> 33:47.263
He wasn't the mole.

33:50.698 --> 33:51.698
You were.

33:53.472 --> 33:54.851
Gio's lying.

33:55.296 --> 33:56.718
He's lying if he's still alive.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.929
He knew you'd kill him anyway
if he didn't make up shit.

33:58.953 --> 34:01.054
I knew there was no way
that Gio would ever,

34:01.421 --> 34:02.888
ever turn against me.

34:04.135 --> 34:05.867
I should have followed my gut.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.078
But you...

34:09.217 --> 34:11.342
You knew exactly how to work me.

34:15.396 --> 34:16.648
I just want to know.

34:18.527 --> 34:23.039
Did Sal get to you before or
after they killed my son?

34:25.385 --> 34:26.627
Was it before

34:26.652 --> 34:27.875
or was it after?

34:29.251 --> 34:32.467
- Was it before or was it after?
- Neither.

34:34.549 --> 34:35.947
They didn't approach me.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.257
I approached them.

34:38.781 --> 34:40.467
I went to them.

34:41.578 --> 34:44.054
So, you want to work with us?

34:44.397 --> 34:45.484
I do.

34:46.367 --> 34:47.835
You've taken out Vito's kid,

34:47.980 --> 34:49.187
his old man,

34:49.502 --> 34:51.422
that's not going to give you
everything you want.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.867
Vito Rizzuto's more than just a name.

34:54.453 --> 34:56.440
You want to take down
the entire operation,

34:56.509 --> 34:58.190
you're going to
need someone on the inside.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.718
What'd Vito do to you?

35:04.230 --> 35:05.630
What'd he do to you?

35:07.380 --> 35:08.796
They killed my son.

35:10.455 --> 35:12.046
They killed my son!

35:12.071 --> 35:14.875
Everybody we've ever killed

35:15.876 --> 35:18.044
was somebody's son, Vito.

35:18.818 --> 35:20.406
What makes your pain

35:20.637 --> 35:22.137
more important than theirs?

35:30.207 --> 35:31.207
Who are you?

35:32.531 --> 35:34.203
I never knew.

35:34.807 --> 35:36.164
I never had anyone

35:36.648 --> 35:38.070
until I had you.

35:38.642 --> 35:41.843
You welcomed me home, you
said, "I'll never forget it."

35:41.868 --> 35:45.665
Your son, I tried to protect
him, God as my witness.

35:45.690 --> 35:47.945
And your father, I loved him.

35:48.258 --> 35:50.092
I loved him and he loved me.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.531
I was family.

35:51.726 --> 35:53.861
Like you always told me I was.

35:53.930 --> 35:55.164
And then...

35:56.289 --> 35:58.242
You told me the real truth.

35:58.954 --> 36:00.286
I was just an employee.

36:00.379 --> 36:01.710
Just on the payroll.

36:02.657 --> 36:04.523
I did everything for you.

36:04.847 --> 36:07.681
I spent four years
in prison, unprotected,

36:07.706 --> 36:08.742
for what?

36:08.928 --> 36:10.507
For what? A job?

36:11.605 --> 36:13.104
I can do your job.

36:18.499 --> 36:20.899
I don't know why I didn't see it before.

36:22.825 --> 36:24.524
You're a frigging animal.

36:25.228 --> 36:26.945
You hired a gangster.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.961
You surprised I'm better at it than you?

36:33.368 --> 36:34.507
Wanna kill me?

36:35.403 --> 36:36.539
Go ahead.

36:37.142 --> 36:38.375
Or else, get out.

37:35.112 --> 37:36.878
I can cancel if you want.

37:36.903 --> 37:38.328
It's just a dinner with friends.

37:38.479 --> 37:39.593
No.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.351
You go.

37:42.014 --> 37:44.064
I'll be fine, you know. I wanna...

37:45.468 --> 37:47.062
I want to be alone, anyway.

37:47.610 --> 37:49.023
- Okay.
- Yeah.

37:50.202 --> 37:52.453
- I won't be late.
- All right.

38:41.948 --> 38:43.480
Happy birthday, my son.

39:07.148 --> 39:08.609
We got a deal, Sal?

39:08.961 --> 39:10.429
But you're not on the inside.

39:11.322 --> 39:12.587
He froze you out.

39:12.612 --> 39:14.225
I mean, what kind of partner
are you going to be

39:14.249 --> 39:15.815
if they're not even talking to you?

39:16.131 --> 39:17.763
I know how to get back in.

39:20.635 --> 39:22.625
Him. I'm going to need your boy.

39:23.873 --> 39:25.754
You should build
yourself something nice.

39:25.888 --> 39:27.937
No, I like it, just the way it is.

39:28.046 --> 39:31.280
Quiet, nice, cheap.

39:36.402 --> 39:37.859
Holy shit!

39:38.021 --> 39:40.476
They tried to wipe out the family.

39:40.869 --> 39:42.002
Including you.

39:43.558 --> 39:44.585
You're one of us.

39:44.610 --> 39:46.410
And once I'm back in,

39:46.435 --> 39:48.289
I'll get Vito to do the work for us.

39:48.916 --> 39:50.101
What do you think?

39:50.889 --> 39:53.956
I think we should clear
the whole goddamn board.

39:55.514 --> 39:56.646
Kill them all.

39:58.140 --> 39:59.414
No one left but us.

40:01.977 --> 40:04.140
Now we're going to dismantle operations.

40:05.267 --> 40:06.832
Vito and his businesses,

40:06.963 --> 40:08.563
we're going to start tearing them apart.

40:08.668 --> 40:10.343
Little by little by little.

40:11.136 --> 40:13.436
I'm going to start
giving you our drop points.

40:14.593 --> 40:16.554
There's a farm,
down by the Vermont border.

40:17.797 --> 40:20.398
Stash house in Little Burgundy.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.045
- What? What the...
- Don't move.

40:22.113 --> 40:23.789
- Easy, easy.
- Okay. Okay.

40:23.814 --> 40:25.687
Everything's working just fine.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.414
But now I've got to give him a mole.

40:28.851 --> 40:30.953
Which means
I've got to sacrifice a pawn.

40:31.773 --> 40:33.492
How far are we going to take this?

40:33.761 --> 40:35.193
All the way.

40:41.695 --> 40:43.054
And the coup de grace.

40:43.837 --> 40:45.460
I'll take care of that.

42:03.693 --> 42:04.957
Hey, man.

42:09.636 --> 42:11.707
- Good to see you, brother.
- You, too.

42:14.453 --> 42:16.620
- It was a good month.
- Yeah, they all are.

42:16.645 --> 42:18.846
- Yeah.
- You guys...

42:18.871 --> 42:20.938
- Want to stay for beer?
- No can do.

42:21.032 --> 42:23.699
We've got an initiation
ceremony for two new recruits.

42:24.101 --> 42:25.901
So I'll be out of touch for a few days.

42:26.259 --> 42:28.004
- See ya.
- Salut.
