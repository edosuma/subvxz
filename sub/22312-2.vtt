13:09.788 --> 13:12.583
Frankie, would you like some help?

13:12.666 --> 13:15.085
[MUFFLED] Uh, no, I don't need any help!

13:16.587 --> 13:19.465
Whoa! [GRUNTS AND SIGHS]

13:19.548 --> 13:21.842
Okay, maybe just a little help.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.095
I can help you, Frankie.
I know the perfect spell!

13:25.179 --> 13:30.017

13:32.770 --> 13:36.357
- Thanks, Katya!
- You're welcome, Frankie.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.109
All right, it's time to
leave for the library!

13:39.193 --> 13:41.682
We're going to walk there, so make sure

13:41.689 --> 13:44.496
you can see me or Igor the whole way.

We don't want anyone to get lost.

Ooh, I can help!

13:49.203 --> 13:52.831
Everyone, grab hold of my
wrap so we stay together.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.833
Great idea, Cleo.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.343
[ALL] Whoa!

14:05.052 --> 14:08.556
Um... those are a lot
of stairs to climb.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.393
I can help! Let me help! I
really, really wanna help!

14:12.476 --> 14:15.312
Up, up and away, take
us to the library today.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.237
Whoa! We're on the roof!

14:23.946 --> 14:27.157
[GASPS] Sorry! I was
just trying to be helpful.

14:27.241 --> 14:32.121
Thank you for trying, Katya, but
now we need to find a way down.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.290
I'm sure I can do it right this time!

14:34.373 --> 14:35.416
[ALL EXCLAIMING]

14:35.499 --> 14:40.170
Let's see if we can find a way into
the library without a magic spell.

14:40.796 --> 14:44.049
A really good witch
could do it, no problem.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.806
There's a staircase on the other side.

14:50.890 --> 14:56.103
I just need to go inside
and unlock the door.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.815
Oh! Thank you, Zoe.
That was very helpful.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.109
- Wow. Thanks, Zoe.
- Great job, Zoe.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.527
Thank you, Zoe.

[HENRI MEOWS]

15:08.574 --> 15:12.161
I wanted to help, but I
only made things worse.

15:12.244 --> 15:16.457
How will I ever be a good witch like
my mom if I can't be more helpful?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.380
[COUGHS]

15:23.464 --> 15:26.926
Oh, there's no way I can read like this!

15:27.009 --> 15:29.929
Hi, Cleo. Can I help
you get rid of that dust?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.306
That's okay. I got it.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.104
Much better.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.441
- I guess she doesn't need my help.
- [MEOWS]

15:43.776 --> 15:45.380
[MAN OVER HEADPHONES] I will now teach

15:45.387 --> 15:47.285
you how to say "hello" in Mandarin.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.538
What am I gonna learn
here at the library?

15:56.622 --> 16:00.084
And then the good witch
turned everyone in the kingdom

16:00.167 --> 16:03.796
from frogs back into humans!

16:03.879 --> 16:04.964
Oh, would you like to join us?

16:05.047 --> 16:08.676
I'm reading a story about
a very helpful witch!

16:08.759 --> 16:10.135
No, thanks!

16:11.595 --> 16:13.472
[KATYA] That is a very good story,

16:13.555 --> 16:15.975
but I don't want to hear
about a helpful witch,

16:16.058 --> 16:18.394
I want to learn to be one!

[GASPS] Whoa!

16:31.281 --> 16:32.616
I'm just not getting it!

16:32.700 --> 16:35.285
Shouldn't the book be upside down, too?

16:35.369 --> 16:37.538
Huh? [GRUNTS]

16:37.621 --> 16:42.001
Oh, now I get it! [CHUCKLES] Thanks,
Katya. That was really helpful.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.045
I like being helpful!

Come on, let's see if
anyone else needs our help.

See ya!

16:51.927 --> 16:54.805
Oh, these are all good
books about helping.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.890
Here's one about bathing your cat.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.855
Oh, what is that?

17:02.938 --> 17:07.067
[GASPS] It would be so
helpful if I cleaned that spot.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.819
And I already know a cleaning spell,

17:09.903 --> 17:11.780
I just have to remember the words...

17:11.864 --> 17:13.906
Flim, flam, zeen!

17:13.991 --> 17:16.910
Or is it "mean", or "gleam"?

17:16.993 --> 17:18.537
Oh, I know! It's "bean"!

17:18.619 --> 17:21.080
Make this spot, um, clean!

17:24.877 --> 17:26.336
[GASPS AND SHUDDERS]

17:26.420 --> 17:30.716
I hope nobody saw that. That
would be so embarrassing.

17:30.799 --> 17:35.137
Flim, flam, bean, make
this spot sparkle and sheen!

17:36.055 --> 17:38.223
Oh, that's not good!

17:38.307 --> 17:41.477
Flim, flam, bean, don't
let this pile lean!

17:42.936 --> 17:44.271
Oh!

17:45.355 --> 17:47.399
Uh, at least it's not leaning!

17:47.483 --> 17:51.028
Uh, flim, flam, bean, make
this pile leave the scene!

Run!

18:08.670 --> 18:12.257
Oh, no, what have I done?

18:12.341 --> 18:15.135
That's a really good question.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.971
I thought you were gonna read
a book like the rest of us.

18:20.682 --> 18:24.186
I just wanted to be helpful
and clean the spot on the floor.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.856
But the spot became a pile of
beans, and then a hill of beans,

18:27.940 --> 18:32.277
and then a giant tower of
beans, and I'm so sorry.

right. Yeah! [CHUCKLES]

had to help me fix my mistakes.

19:41.096 --> 19:44.057
Katya, I know how much
you like to be helpful.

19:44.141 --> 19:49.271
But, sometimes you have to be willing
to ask other people to help you.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.775
I should have asked for help the
first time the spell went wrong.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.987
Instead, I just made it worse.

19:57.070 --> 20:01.200
I just wish someone could help me
remember the words to the spell.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.410
Then I could finish cleaning things up.

just the help I needed.
