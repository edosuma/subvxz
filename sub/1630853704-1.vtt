00:02.061 --> 00:16.907
<i> ¶</i>

00:16.925 --> 00:17.758
<i> ¶</i>

00:17.852 --> 00:19.760
<i> I, Olivia Winfield Foxworth,</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:24.081
<i> do declare this to be my last</i>
<i> will and testament.</i>

00:24.099 --> 00:27.026
<i> Some may have an idea</i>
<i> of who I was.</i>

00:27.253 --> 00:29.086
<i> A wife. A mother.</i>

00:29.104 --> 00:31.030
<i> The grandmother.</i>

00:31.257 --> 00:33.532
<i> A monster.</i>

00:33.683 --> 00:36.777
<i> I only ask that you withhold</i>
<i> final judgment</i>

00:36.871 --> 00:39.538
<i>until you know the true story.</i>

00:39.765 --> 00:43.709
<i> And knowing the truth,</i>
<i> judge me if you dare.</i>

00:44.787 --> 00:47.963
<i> And so now at long last...</i>

00:50.276 --> 00:52.217
<i> This is my story.</i>

00:56.724 --> 01:00.708
"A seven letter word
for righting a wrong."

01:00.728 --> 01:01.952
Correct.

01:01.970 --> 01:03.312
No.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.356
Revenge.

01:07.884 --> 01:08.883
That's it.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.385
My mother always said

01:10.479 --> 01:13.906
the only thing that takes longer
than forgiveness is revenge.

01:14.133 --> 01:16.408
And she was right,
it's now made me late.

01:16.635 --> 01:18.494
To be continued
in the evening.

01:19.655 --> 01:22.748
<i> ¶</i>

01:22.975 --> 01:24.899
<i> Yes, work.</i>

01:24.919 --> 01:27.753
<i> It was unusual for a woman</i>
<i> at the time.</i>

01:30.649 --> 01:33.050
[train horn blowing]

01:43.829 --> 01:44.586
You're late.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.087
Sorry Father.

01:46.107 --> 01:50.167
I flagged inconsistencies
between ports of entry and exit.

01:50.185 --> 01:51.852
We should confirm our bid
by tomorrow.

01:52.004 --> 01:52.927
Oh, thank you, dear.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.171
And could you take a look
at this?

01:54.189 --> 01:55.114
Mm-hmm.

01:58.768 --> 02:01.102
Expansion into
the Mediterranean?

02:01.196 --> 02:02.362
It's currently a war zone.

02:02.514 --> 02:03.956
Wars end.

02:04.183 --> 02:07.517
And when they do, there will
be opportunities.

02:07.536 --> 02:10.187
I'll read tonight and get back
to you in the morning.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.797
Perhaps you could read
this afternoon.

02:11.948 --> 02:14.782
An associate from Virginia will
be dining at the house tonight.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.470
It's his proposition.
I'd like you to join us.

02:18.622 --> 02:20.197
Very well.

02:20.215 --> 02:23.892
He happens to be... unattached.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.205
Am I wanted at dinner for
my professional perspective

02:28.223 --> 02:31.041
or for another of your failed
attempts at matchmaking?

02:31.059 --> 02:34.060
If your business acumen
happens to attract a suitor

02:34.155 --> 02:35.228
it's no fault of mine.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.156
But it never has before.

02:37.307 --> 02:38.991
I think I'll dine
in my room tonight.

02:39.142 --> 02:40.884
Well, your loss.

02:40.977 --> 02:43.662
One cannot lose something
one has never possessed.

02:43.813 --> 02:46.556
He's a Foxworth.

02:46.575 --> 02:49.984
Sole heir to the Foxworth
mining fortune.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.395
The Malcolm Foxworth?

02:51.413 --> 02:52.421
Yes.

02:53.749 --> 02:55.674
What would he want with me?

02:55.825 --> 02:57.401
Olivia, darling.

02:57.419 --> 02:59.419
Father, I'm fine.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.162
I'm happy.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.424
The time for romance
has long passed me by.

03:04.576 --> 03:09.188
Olivia, your mother always
wanted you to find a husband.

03:15.512 --> 03:17.321
What time?

03:22.761 --> 03:24.110
Olivia, my darling.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.947
I'd like you to meet an
associate of mine from Virginia.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.766
I'm proud to present my
daughter, Olivia Winfield.

03:29.785 --> 03:33.837
<i> Olivia,</i>
<i> Mr. Malcolm Neil Foxworth.</i>

03:38.277 --> 03:39.635
[deep sigh]

03:45.467 --> 03:46.616
Charmed, Miss Winfield.

03:46.635 --> 03:49.519
The feeling is quite mutual,
I'm sure.

03:50.547 --> 03:52.289
[doorbell rings]

03:52.382 --> 03:54.399
Who would be calling
at this hour?

03:56.886 --> 03:58.528
Mr. John Amos.

04:00.132 --> 04:01.481
Cousin Amos.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.801
How good of you to join us,
and on such short notice.

04:04.894 --> 04:07.913
Amos, my boy.
Always good to see you.

04:08.140 --> 04:12.567
Meet an associate of mine,
Mr. Malcolm Foxworth.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.327
How do you do?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.421
Exceedingly well.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.819
Amos: Bless us,
O Heavenly Father,

04:22.912 --> 04:25.764
for these thy gifts which
we are about to receive.

04:25.915 --> 04:27.391
All: Amen.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.437
Thank you, Amos.

04:32.589 --> 04:36.108
My cousin here is getting
his doctorate in theology.

04:36.335 --> 04:40.020
Are you a religious man
yourself, Mr. Foxworth?

04:40.114 --> 04:45.284
I believe the religion,
much like wealth and emotion,

04:45.435 --> 04:50.289
is food for personal thought,
not for the dinner table.

04:54.110 --> 04:56.703
You keep a lovely home,
Miss Winfield.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.873
I am fortunate enough to live
in a lovely home, Mr. Foxworth,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.883
but I do not keep it.

05:04.287 --> 05:07.139
I work with my father
at our office downtown.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.201
Keeping the books.

05:11.219 --> 05:12.978
Keeping them from whom?

05:13.129 --> 05:14.813
[chuckles]

05:16.299 --> 05:20.485
Cousin Olivia and my uncle
are partners in business.

05:20.637 --> 05:23.137
God did not give me a son,

05:23.157 --> 05:26.658
but fortune has given me
something far greater.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.327
Thank you, Father.

05:29.738 --> 05:31.721
For how long do we have
the pleasure

05:31.740 --> 05:33.223
of hosting you in our city?

05:33.316 --> 05:37.151
I return to Foxworth
Hall tomorrow.

05:37.245 --> 05:38.728
That is my home in Virginia.

05:38.747 --> 05:40.339
How terribly sad.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.467
For us all.

05:45.829 --> 05:48.663
I suppose we should get
down to it then.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.767
You're here to discuss business,
are you not?

05:54.262 --> 05:55.745
Are you actually suggesting

05:55.839 --> 05:58.081
purchasing the merchant
marine fleet?

05:58.174 --> 06:00.859
Once the war comes
to an end, yes.

06:01.010 --> 06:03.028
Postwar economies
quickly turn.

06:03.179 --> 06:03.920
It's history.

06:03.939 --> 06:05.255
It's predatory.

06:05.273 --> 06:07.032
Surely taking advantage
of a nation

06:07.259 --> 06:09.926
in need of healing
isn't appropriate.

06:10.019 --> 06:13.372
Healing is the business
of nurses.

06:13.523 --> 06:16.375
Business is the business
of men.

06:16.526 --> 06:17.525
Perhaps today.

06:17.619 --> 06:19.119
But when women get the vote,

06:19.271 --> 06:22.455
business will be the business of
he or she who is most qualified.

06:22.608 --> 06:25.625
And your qualifications exceed
those of my own?

06:25.719 --> 06:31.223
I would never be so presumptuous
as I know so little of you.

06:31.374 --> 06:35.018
Well, perhaps we should endeavor
to change that.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.357
May I call on you tomorrow?

06:42.477 --> 06:43.902
Have you forgotten
that you're returning

06:44.053 --> 06:47.480
to Foxworth Hall
in the morning?

06:47.633 --> 06:49.366
Well, plans can change.

06:52.413 --> 06:56.473
Much like ideas.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.417
Wouldn't you agree,
Miss Winfield?

07:10.672 --> 07:15.008
<i> Olivia: For the first time in</i>
<i> my life I could not read,</i>

07:15.102 --> 07:17.769
<i> because for the first time</i>
<i> the romance in my real life</i>

07:17.921 --> 07:20.897
<i> eclipsed that of the stories</i>
<i> on the pages.</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:36.288
Miss Winfield,
you look lovely.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.417
For you.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.468
For your work.

07:49.695 --> 07:53.638
Perhaps we could talk
more about what it is
that you do on a walk.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.701
With your permission,
of course.

07:57.719 --> 07:59.794
Thank you for asking,
Mr. Foxworth.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.482
But you do not need anyone's
permission but my own.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.400
And you have it.

08:09.305 --> 08:12.732
So, what do people
make of it?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.068
Oh, come now, you must know
it is somewhat unorthodox

08:15.162 --> 08:17.996
for a woman and her father
to be partners in business.

08:18.147 --> 08:19.748
You don't say.

08:21.484 --> 08:23.651
Do you enjoy challenging
conventions?

08:23.745 --> 08:25.152
Quite the contrary.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.564
I'd enjoy if I didn't have to.

08:27.657 --> 08:30.992
People make a fuss until
they get into the work.

08:31.086 --> 08:35.013
Once I prove myself,
it gets easier.

08:39.261 --> 08:42.245
I hope you don't
find me presumptuous,

08:42.338 --> 08:45.006
but I put in a call
to the club.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.025
We have a table for dinner.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.945
Not at all.

08:53.608 --> 08:55.700
Do you have a large family?

08:55.852 --> 08:59.095
I picture relatives
overstaying their welcome.

08:59.114 --> 09:03.041
Raucous holiday dinners
out in the country.

09:03.268 --> 09:05.377
Not at all.

09:05.604 --> 09:09.196
My father has been traveling
in retirement

09:09.216 --> 09:13.960
and my mother passed
when I was five.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.872
So, now it's just me.

09:17.966 --> 09:21.634
I'm sorry. You were just
a boy.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.728
It made me a man.

09:29.719 --> 09:31.552
Not half bad for the city.

09:31.646 --> 09:35.148
Ahh. A country imperialist.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.633
Mock me all you want

09:36.651 --> 09:39.894
but we breed our own line of
sheep at Foxworth Hall.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.806
Best lamb you have
ever tasted.

09:42.899 --> 09:44.641
Tell me about it,
your home.

09:44.659 --> 09:48.645
This Foxworth Hall you speak of
with such affection.

09:48.663 --> 09:52.999
It is more than a home.

09:53.151 --> 09:59.413
It is my family's history
and its future.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.992
What do you see
for that future?

10:03.086 --> 10:05.511
An empire.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.273
An empire it is then.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.861
It's a letter.

10:22.013 --> 10:24.438
You wrote it but forgot
to sign.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.457
Did I?

10:25.684 --> 10:26.866
Indeed.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.852
Last night in fact.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.203
It seems you had some questions

10:30.355 --> 10:33.948
for Mr. Foxworth's business
colleagues in Virginia.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.026
His family, his background,
his character.

10:37.045 --> 10:40.305
It so happens you were really
quite curious.

10:40.456 --> 10:44.291
And why might I
be so curious?

10:44.386 --> 10:46.478
Because if the letter came from
me, I wouldn't get a response.

10:46.705 --> 10:50.649
But from you, a distinguished
gentleman...

10:50.876 --> 10:52.375
Olivia.

10:52.468 --> 10:54.894
I know more about his house than
I do about his flesh and blood.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.896
Everybody has secrets.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.140
Please, Father.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.809
I need to know what
I'm getting myself into.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.495
Mr. Malcolm Foxworth.

11:06.224 --> 11:10.076
<i> ¶</i>

11:10.170 --> 11:12.412
<i> Olivia: But it was too late.</i>

11:12.564 --> 11:14.564
<i> I was already in.</i>

11:14.582 --> 11:18.584
<i>I was the Countess Ellen Olenska</i>
<i> on the arm of Mr. Archer,</i>

11:18.737 --> 11:21.346
<i> only he knocked on the door</i>
<i> in the end.</i>

11:22.590 --> 11:24.849
<i> I was Elizabeth Bennet</i>
<i> with Mr. Darcy,</i>

11:25.076 --> 11:27.668
<i> only without the annoying</i>
<i> sisters.</i>

11:27.688 --> 11:31.581
<i> I was Jane Eyre capturing</i>
<i> the heart of Mr. Rochester,</i>

11:31.674 --> 11:34.442
<i> only without ghosts</i>
<i> in the attic.</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:38.846
We have received a response
to your inquiry.

11:38.940 --> 11:40.615
<i> Olivia: I was fooling myself.</i>

11:45.855 --> 11:47.354
This just confirms
everything we know.

11:47.449 --> 11:49.690
The business,
Foxworth Hall.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.376
Mmmhmm. Keep reading.

11:54.272 --> 11:56.214
-His mother.
-Hm.

11:56.441 --> 12:00.552
It appears she did not die
when he was a boy.

12:00.779 --> 12:02.554
Why would anyone lie
about such a thing?

12:02.781 --> 12:05.539
And if one would lie
about their own mother...

12:05.633 --> 12:06.725
What else might he
be hiding?

12:06.952 --> 12:08.143
Hmm.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.562
[doorbell rings]

12:10.789 --> 12:11.396
It's him.

12:11.623 --> 12:13.022
Not a word.

12:22.892 --> 12:25.226
As I am not often courted,

12:25.320 --> 12:28.638
the steps to the dance
we've been doing

12:28.656 --> 12:32.158
aren't always familiar.

12:32.252 --> 12:37.839
And I'm not as trusting as
others you may have pursued.

12:40.668 --> 12:48.391
Which is why I inquired
as to your family's history.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.086
I see.

12:52.180 --> 12:55.256
It has come to my attention
that your mother did not die

12:55.275 --> 12:57.025
when you were a child.

12:58.445 --> 13:02.280
In fact, I understand
she died quite recently.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.949
I am very sorry for your loss,
however...

13:05.101 --> 13:08.845
There is nothing
to be sorry about.

13:08.938 --> 13:12.791
And I never should
have misled you.

13:12.942 --> 13:14.517
When I was five years old,

13:14.610 --> 13:20.023
my mother abandoned
my father and me.

13:20.041 --> 13:24.952
I never heard from
or about her again

13:24.971 --> 13:28.056
until I learned of her death
not long ago.

13:31.202 --> 13:35.705
When I said my mother died
when I was a boy,

13:35.723 --> 13:37.482
I wasn't lying.

13:37.709 --> 13:40.043
She did die.

13:40.061 --> 13:42.211
At least to me.

13:42.305 --> 13:47.567
How horrid of me
to have doubted you.

13:47.719 --> 13:49.886
I'm sure you can never
forgive me, deservedly so.

13:49.904 --> 13:51.387
There is nothing to forgive.

13:51.406 --> 13:53.164
It is exactly that
inquisitive nature

13:53.316 --> 13:55.500
that I find so intriguing.

14:00.065 --> 14:03.566
When I learned of
my mother's death

14:03.659 --> 14:10.573
I realized that life is long
when one is alone,

14:10.592 --> 14:12.258
and the price one pays
for happiness

14:12.352 --> 14:15.912
is time's quick passage.

14:16.005 --> 14:20.766
And upon meeting you, I lost
all track of time.

14:20.861 --> 14:27.365
Has it been a week, a month,
a moment, or a lifetime?

14:33.598 --> 14:36.523
Let's make it a lifetime,
Olivia.

14:36.618 --> 14:43.623
¶

14:43.775 --> 14:44.716
Oh.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.472
Will you marry me?

14:53.451 --> 14:55.968
I am offering you my heart.

14:56.062 --> 15:02.141
A heart that will surely break
if you don't say something.

15:02.293 --> 15:03.651
Anything.

15:05.463 --> 15:06.529
Yes.

15:06.965 --> 15:07.906
Yes!

15:19.978 --> 15:21.586
[laughs]

15:29.671 --> 15:31.821
<i>Olivia: Could it really be true?</i>

15:31.839 --> 15:34.840
<i> I was to have all this.</i>

15:34.993 --> 15:37.677
<i> A home of my own.</i>

15:37.771 --> 15:40.396
<i> A husband of my own.</i>

15:43.777 --> 15:44.925
[knocking at door]

15:44.945 --> 15:46.110
-[gasps]
-Excuse the interruption.

15:46.337 --> 15:49.172
Ah, Amos.

15:49.265 --> 15:52.191
I know it's terribly improper
of me to intrude.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.618
Oh, nonsense.

15:53.845 --> 15:55.286
Do come in.

16:08.860 --> 16:12.220
A little something
for your special day.

16:15.533 --> 16:18.534
"Eternally united."
How lovely.

16:18.627 --> 16:20.895
You and Mr. Foxworth,
of course.

16:24.225 --> 16:27.318
I hope this reminds you to
keep up our correspondence

16:27.470 --> 16:30.154
once you've settled into
your new life in Virginia.

16:30.306 --> 16:33.116
As if I'd need reminding.
Thank you.

16:40.149 --> 16:43.835
Are you sure this is
what you want?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.422
To marry Mr. Foxworth?

16:49.009 --> 16:49.966
It is.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.263
Ah, there's my darling daughter.

16:57.742 --> 16:59.909
I was just leaving.

16:59.927 --> 17:02.270
Thank you, again.

17:07.602 --> 17:09.510
You look radiant.

17:09.529 --> 17:14.181
[laughs]
Can you believe it?
Me, a bride.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.759
Now being a bride
and being a wife

17:16.778 --> 17:18.870
are two very
different things.

17:19.097 --> 17:20.187
People will look
at you differently.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.782
Your husband will look
at you differently.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.435
But you must never look
at yourself differently.

17:26.529 --> 17:29.438
You must never forget
who you are.

17:29.457 --> 17:33.534
You have everything you need
right here.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.553
Let your heart be
your compass.

17:37.465 --> 17:39.974
But if you should ever
lose your way...

17:44.138 --> 17:46.380
From the man who always
taught me to study religion

17:46.474 --> 17:47.732
but not espouse it.

17:47.883 --> 17:50.126
No, not from me.

17:50.144 --> 17:51.460
From your mother.

17:51.554 --> 17:54.054
She always wanted you
to have it.

17:54.074 --> 18:01.079
And I thought well,
if not now then when?

18:04.325 --> 18:06.900
[sighs]

18:06.994 --> 18:09.495
You look just like her.

18:09.647 --> 18:11.923
[tearfully] I wish
she were here.

It's so very dark.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.458
You'll get used to it.

18:47.685 --> 18:50.019
Foxworth Hall does not have
the electric light.

18:50.112 --> 18:54.540
Well, that's romantic,
I'm sure.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.468
As is Venice, so I hear.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.714
For our honeymoon.

19:01.866 --> 19:04.550
After the wedding party,
of course.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.702
Yes, of course.

19:06.795 --> 19:08.462
We'll discuss our travel plans

19:08.481 --> 19:10.890
once you acclimate yourself
to your new job.

19:10.984 --> 19:15.211
I hardly think being mistress
of the house constitutes a job.

19:15.304 --> 19:18.731
Oh, you haven't seen
Foxworth Hall yet.

19:18.825 --> 19:24.570
It is your domain now to run
and manage as you like.

19:24.664 --> 19:29.316
But I assure you it will require
your full-time supervision.

23:28.799 --> 23:31.575
Mr. Foxworth already left
for town.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.972
He had an early
business meeting.

23:37.065 --> 23:38.490
Of course.

23:38.643 --> 23:41.644
How silly of me. I must
have forgotten.

23:41.737 --> 23:46.590
If you've finished, Mr. Foxworth
requested I show you something.

23:55.918 --> 24:00.420
I couldn't ask for a more
perfect wedding gift.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.442
Malcolm knows I have
a passion for reading.

24:04.593 --> 24:06.527
I'm sure you do.

wished for me to show you.

24:27.525 --> 24:29.525
Your office.

24:29.543 --> 24:31.451
Mr. Foxworth would like you
to conduct the business

24:31.545 --> 24:35.197
of Foxworth Hall from here.

24:35.290 --> 24:37.975
He said you may
begin immediately.

24:44.466 --> 24:46.875
Would you like to take me
on a tour of the house?

24:46.894 --> 24:50.136
Oh, Mr. Foxworth doesn't like
people roaming about.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.306
I would hardly say his wife
qualifies as "people."

24:53.400 --> 24:55.067
My apologies, Mrs. Foxworth.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.327
Quite all right.

24:56.554 --> 24:57.453
Please.

24:59.557 --> 25:03.000
Share with me some of
the family's history.

25:03.151 --> 25:05.151
Have you worked here long?

25:05.246 --> 25:08.154
My mother was employed here.

25:08.174 --> 25:12.343
Foxworth Hall has been my home
since birth.

25:12.494 --> 25:17.497
I was raised here alongside
Mr. Garland Foxworth,

25:17.591 --> 25:19.350
your new father-in-law.

25:19.501 --> 25:21.852
Then you are perfectly suited
to be my guide.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.855
Please.

25:25.082 --> 25:26.749
How am I to conduct the business
of Foxworth Hall

25:26.842 --> 25:29.009
if I'm not acquainted
with it myself?

25:29.028 --> 25:32.604
But I am afraid I'm needed
in the kitchen.

25:32.757 --> 25:34.180
Well then...

25:34.275 --> 25:37.609
You should get to it,
shouldn't you?

25:37.762 --> 25:39.370
If you'll excuse me.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.556
Nella.

26:00.785 --> 26:02.451
Yes, Mrs. Foxworth.

26:02.469 --> 26:05.287
I seem to be on a tour
without a guide.

26:05.306 --> 26:07.356
Will you show me around
my new home?

26:11.737 --> 26:14.980
Is it always so dark
in here?

26:15.132 --> 26:17.057
I suppose I'm used to it.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.817
My father always says
that someone's home

26:18.911 --> 26:22.162
is a window into their soul
second only to their eyes.

26:25.326 --> 26:26.900
I hope that's not true.

26:26.919 --> 26:32.164
I only meant, well, because
my home is rather modest.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.000
A virtue that perhaps
the Foxworths could've used

26:35.094 --> 26:36.760
a little more of, no?

26:43.752 --> 26:46.011
So, who were they?

26:46.163 --> 26:49.014
Well, the first Mr. Foxworth
made his fortune in mining.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.757
I know all about that.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.592
I want to know who they were.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.260
What made them smile.

26:54.355 --> 26:55.946
How they passed their time.

26:56.173 --> 26:58.098
I really can't say.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.576
Because you don't know or
because you won't tell me?

27:03.180 --> 27:06.081
A mystery I will have
to solve myself then.

27:10.354 --> 27:13.355
Someday your portrait will hang
on these walls.

27:13.448 --> 27:15.591
Well, I'll be sure to smile
in mine.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.762
I hope you do.

27:28.630 --> 27:31.874
I had a dull house back
in New London

27:31.967 --> 27:34.877
that felt more alive
than these halls.

27:34.970 --> 27:37.229
Where's the color?
Where's the life?

27:37.323 --> 27:40.282
Mr. Foxworth likes us to keep
everything just as it is.

27:46.073 --> 27:47.998
I think I'm already lost.

27:48.150 --> 27:51.001
Foxworth Hall has a way
of doing that to people.

27:51.153 --> 27:54.672
This is the East Wing.
It's rarely used these days.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.082
What's that?

27:57.234 --> 28:00.177
A lock on the outside
of a bedroom door.

28:00.404 --> 28:03.597
Is this where you keep
the misbehaved guests?

28:04.742 --> 28:06.684
¶

28:30.710 --> 28:32.209
We don't go there!

28:32.436 --> 28:33.936
And why not?

28:34.029 --> 28:36.121
Mr. Foxworth says
it's off limits.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.549
And it may very well be
but surely not to me.

28:38.776 --> 28:40.700
Or to you, as long
as you're with me.

28:40.794 --> 28:43.053
I really shouldn't.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.555
Please?

28:44.706 --> 28:46.706
Very well.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.726
Thank you for the tour.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.512
Narcissistic.

34:20.542 --> 34:22.059
Beautiful.

34:24.546 --> 34:27.305
I'm assuming you saw
her picture.

34:27.457 --> 34:30.625
And what did you think?

34:30.718 --> 34:35.980
She was beautiful,
you're right.

34:36.075 --> 34:37.407
So beautiful.

34:39.561 --> 34:41.244
Did you see her clothes?

34:42.989 --> 34:44.414
Did you touch them?

34:46.752 --> 34:48.376
How did they feel?

34:49.996 --> 34:52.738
I'm not sure what you mean?

34:52.758 --> 34:55.241
How did they feel?

34:55.335 --> 34:59.888
They felt... lovely.

35:09.683 --> 35:15.070
Would you like to see her room?
Properly this time.

35:33.799 --> 35:37.116
We spent many wonderful days
in this room.

35:37.210 --> 35:39.136
In your mother's bedroom.

35:47.871 --> 35:53.875
My father was away on business
much of the time

35:53.894 --> 35:54.985
and so my mother and I,

35:55.212 --> 35:57.988
we only had each other
for companionship.

36:01.976 --> 36:07.572
That is we did, up until
her 22nd birthday

36:07.724 --> 36:10.909
and I woke up to come give her
her birthday gift.

36:11.061 --> 36:13.578
A music box.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.897
And she was gone.

36:15.916 --> 36:18.583
I thought you said she left
when you were five.

36:18.735 --> 36:19.825
She did.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.829
That would mean she was
very... young.

36:23.849 --> 36:29.411
She used to sit here
and put on her makeup

36:29.429 --> 36:31.188
before she was dressed.

36:31.415 --> 36:36.509
And I would sit right here
and watch,

36:36.528 --> 36:39.487
and tell her when it was
just perfect.

37:01.611 --> 37:03.720
[sighs]

37:03.947 --> 37:06.798
I am so glad you don't
wear makeup.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.800
I actually do.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.618
My mother always told me

37:10.712 --> 37:13.396
if people can tell you're
wearing it then you're
wearing it wrong.

37:15.792 --> 37:17.234
Take it off.

37:19.129 --> 37:20.386
Take it off.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.405
I want to see you.

37:31.641 --> 37:35.585
You won't be anything like her,
will you?

37:39.741 --> 37:42.592
You see? Just perfect.

37:51.845 --> 37:53.328
What are you doing?

37:53.346 --> 37:55.730
I thought that's what wives do.

37:56.666 --> 37:58.275
Please return to your room.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.571
Do you understand?

38:14.942 --> 38:17.777
<i>Olivia: I had experienced many</i>
<i>bad feelings throughout my life.</i>

38:17.796 --> 38:20.797
<i> Self-loathing, guilt,</i>
<i> insecurity.</i>

38:23.043 --> 38:25.635
<i> But never before had</i>
<i> I felt this.</i>

38:27.197 --> 38:28.138
<i> Shame.</i>

38:30.809 --> 38:33.435
Sir, a telegram for you.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.546
The war has ended.

38:44.564 --> 38:47.306
Perhaps this is a sign
of good things to come.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.233
<i> Olivia: Perhaps it was.</i>

38:49.386 --> 38:51.811
<i> A new beginning</i>
<i> in a new place.</i>

38:51.905 --> 38:54.572
Wonderful news, sir.

38:54.724 --> 38:56.649
Now, I beg your pardon,

38:56.743 --> 39:01.487
but we still need to confirm
the menu for the wedding party.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.673
Proceed as I instructed.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.754
Mrs. Steiner.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.848
I didn't dismiss you.

39:15.261 --> 39:17.929
As you said, this house
and its daily business

39:18.081 --> 39:20.431
is my responsibility now.

39:20.525 --> 39:24.268
And our wedding party
will be in this house.

39:24.421 --> 39:27.847
This is about more
than just our wedding.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.849
This is about how we are seen.

39:29.943 --> 39:31.776
It is about the community

39:31.928 --> 39:33.703
understanding that they have
a new mistress.

39:33.855 --> 39:36.264
Well then, who better
to help them understand

39:36.357 --> 39:38.616
than the new mistress herself?

39:38.710 --> 39:40.377
You can trust me.

39:43.773 --> 39:45.715
Well, I am already late
for work.

39:49.221 --> 39:50.220
Very well.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.879
All eyes will be upon us.

39:59.973 --> 40:02.624
We must not disappoint.

40:02.642 --> 40:04.901
Spare no expense.

40:09.966 --> 40:14.911
I will be changing the menu,
among other things.

40:23.329 --> 40:24.812
<i> Olivia: And so I began.</i>

40:24.831 --> 40:25.997
<i> Two weeks.</i>

40:26.149 --> 40:28.332
<i> Two weeks to plan</i>
<i> my own wedding party.</i>

40:28.485 --> 40:32.411
<i> Two weeks to prove that</i>
<i> I knew how to be a wife.</i>

40:32.431 --> 40:34.914
Bigger, I think.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.749
Mrs. Foxworth...

40:36.768 --> 40:41.345
We have never had such robust
displays of opulence

40:41.440 --> 40:42.772
at this house.

40:42.924 --> 40:43.998
Excellent.

40:44.017 --> 40:45.442
Then I'm on the right path.

40:45.593 --> 40:51.281
While the path may be correct,
it's the destination I question.

40:51.432 --> 40:56.619
A certain amount of restraint is
necessary to maintain decorum.

40:56.846 --> 40:58.621
While I do so appreciate
your counsel,

40:58.848 --> 41:01.624
Mr. Foxworth said himself
not to disappoint.

41:01.776 --> 41:04.627
Yes, but I really
must urge caution.

41:04.779 --> 41:07.446
If you must, Mrs. Steiner,
than I must ask your leave.

41:07.540 --> 41:09.207
But we still have much
to plan.

41:09.301 --> 41:10.967
I am well aware.

41:11.118 --> 41:13.544
I will be planning it,
without you.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.597
You are excused.

41:24.040 --> 41:24.939
Nella?

41:27.060 --> 41:28.985
What do you think
of orchids?

41:29.136 --> 41:30.728
They're lovely,
Mrs. Foxworth.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.156
I quite agree.
Join me Nella.

41:34.884 --> 41:39.979

41:39.998 --> 41:41.906

42:10.103 --> 42:11.102
You did it.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.820
We did it.

Are you ready?

42:17.594 --> 42:18.535

43:28.164 --> 43:29.939
It's new, do you like it?

43:30.091 --> 43:32.275
You look like a common
prostitute.

43:35.171 --> 43:36.446

43:39.859 --> 43:42.267
I wanted to look nice
for you.

43:42.362 --> 43:45.179
All the other women are wearing
dresses like this nowadays.

43:45.272 --> 43:49.274
That is precisely why I did not
marry one of these other women.

43:49.294 --> 43:53.296
Your job is not to blend in.
Your job is to stand out.

43:53.447 --> 43:55.614
To set an example
to the community.

43:55.634 --> 43:56.949
I was trying.

43:57.043 --> 44:00.528
And flowers, Olivia.
Dear god.

44:00.621 --> 44:03.956
Orchids in Virginia?
It's gauche.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.125
You said to spare no expense.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.645
Within the boundaries

Good morning, Mrs. Foxworth.

46:49.198 --> 46:53.200
A change in plan for today.
I'll be visiting my father.

46:53.219 --> 46:56.053
It seems I've made the gravest
of miscalculations

46:56.205 --> 46:59.540
in the most important decision
of my life.

46:59.633 --> 47:02.059
How long will you be staying?

47:02.153 --> 47:03.653
Indefinitely.

47:17.076 --> 47:19.001
I am off to the office.

47:20.413 --> 47:22.338
I trust you slept well?

47:24.342 --> 47:25.341
Very.

47:27.828 --> 47:29.679
Well, I will see you tonight.

47:45.697 --> 47:48.255
Your bags are in the car

Amos?

48:25.386 --> 48:26.460
What are you doing here?

48:26.479 --> 48:28.979
Looking for you.
You've had me worried.

48:29.073 --> 48:30.297
Whatever about?

48:30.316 --> 48:31.741
You never responded
to my telegrams.

48:31.892 --> 48:33.534
I never received any.

48:35.896 --> 48:37.655
What is it?
What's wrong?

48:37.749 --> 48:39.206
It's your father.

48:42.420 --> 48:45.404
I'm so sorry.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.999
His cold quickly turned
to pneumonia.

48:49.152 --> 48:51.761
There was nothing
to be done.

48:54.766 --> 48:57.266
I'll return with you.

48:57.493 --> 48:58.826
I'll have to take care
of the house,

48:58.919 --> 49:00.085
settle his business affairs.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.420
That won't be necessary.

49:01.439 --> 49:02.846
Of course it is.

49:02.999 --> 49:09.261
Olivia, there is no house
or business to return to.

49:09.355 --> 49:13.357
When I couldn't reach you, your
father's debtors came to me.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.951
What debt?

49:15.102 --> 49:20.347
I learned that he hid certain
unfortunate realities from you.

49:20.366 --> 49:24.460
Your father was deep in debt.
The house, the business.

49:24.611 --> 49:26.870
It was all taken
upon his death.

49:26.965 --> 49:32.635
No. That's not possible.
It's simply not possible.

49:32.862 --> 49:34.453
I managed to save a few
of your things.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.973
I had the servants take them
to your room.

49:39.626 --> 49:42.144
What am I going to do now?

49:45.466 --> 49:50.227
God's loving grace
gave you a new home

49:50.379 --> 49:55.157
and a new family before
your old one was taken.

<i>Olivia: Despite the dark shadow</i>
<i> of my husband,</i>

55:11.475 --> 55:13.867
<i> there was still light</i>
<i> to be found.</i>

55:13.886 --> 55:16.145
<i>Yes, I was once again expecting.</i>

55:16.372 --> 55:19.297
<i> Another child,</i>
<i> another chance for hope.</i>

55:19.391 --> 55:22.651
Yes. She'll do just fine.

55:22.803 --> 55:27.639
Do you happen to have others
in different breeds and colors?

55:27.733 --> 55:29.641
Mrs. Foxworth, look!

55:29.735 --> 55:33.329
<i> And hope was all around</i>
<i> if you knew where to look.</i>

55:33.480 --> 55:35.456
[laughs]
It's happening!

55:37.226 --> 55:38.316
[screaming in pain]

55:38.410 --> 55:40.669
That's it.
There we go.

55:40.896 --> 55:42.153
There we go.

55:42.247 --> 55:45.582
[screaming in pain]

55:45.676 --> 55:51.088
[laughing]

55:51.182 --> 55:56.185
[baby crying]

56:02.026 --> 56:03.417
Do we have a girl?

56:03.435 --> 56:04.693
You have a son.

56:04.845 --> 56:08.939
Another healthy son,
Mr. Foxworth.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.324
Congratulations.

56:13.779 --> 56:17.114
I'm sorry to tell you this,

56:17.266 --> 56:19.833
but you won't be able to bear
more children.

56:21.770 --> 56:22.544
Huh.

56:26.199 --> 56:29.885
Of course, you would deny me
the one thing that I want.

56:48.297 --> 56:50.297
<i> And so it was only</i>
<i> to be Joel, Mal, and me.</i>

56:50.315 --> 56:52.724
<i> But oh, how I loved them.</i>

56:52.743 --> 56:54.151
[parrot squawking]

56:54.245 --> 56:55.986
<i> Olivia: As much as I wanted</i>
<i> more children,</i>

56:56.080 --> 56:59.873
<i> I felt myself lucky to have</i>
<i> two perfect boys.</i>

57:01.419 --> 57:02.826
<i> And if we had to live</i>
<i> in a prison,</i>

57:02.978 --> 57:06.088
<i> I made that prison</i>
<i> a palace.</i>

57:08.909 --> 57:13.336
My father and his new bride will
be returning to Foxworth Hall.

57:13.431 --> 57:14.838
New bride?

57:14.932 --> 57:16.598
Apparently so.

57:16.750 --> 57:18.416
Did you not know he was
to be married?

57:18.436 --> 57:23.939
This new wife of his, she is not
the mistress of this house.

57:24.166 --> 57:25.590
You are.

57:25.609 --> 57:27.517
What difference does it make
who is the senior Mrs. Foxworth?

57:27.670 --> 57:29.352
All the difference.

57:29.447 --> 57:31.930
I assure you.

57:31.949 --> 57:35.576
Now, I am the master of
this house which makes you...

57:36.787 --> 57:38.620
The mistress.

57:38.772 --> 57:40.789
So you understand.

57:42.851 --> 57:44.918
Do you understand?!

57:45.854 --> 57:46.920
I do.

57:48.132 --> 57:49.131
Good.

57:52.878 --> 57:56.263
<i> ¶</i>

58:00.978 --> 58:02.961
Remember who you are.

58:02.980 --> 58:07.316
Wait. Are you Olivia
or am I?

58:24.668 --> 58:26.001
Malcolm, my boy.

58:27.320 --> 58:28.987
[chuckles]

58:29.006 --> 58:30.005
Malcolm.

58:31.917 --> 58:33.675
Ah, Mrs. Steiner.

58:35.237 --> 58:37.087
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

58:37.181 --> 58:39.239
Always good to have you home,
Mr. Foxworth.

58:39.258 --> 58:41.475
[chuckles]
Good to be home.

58:42.578 --> 58:43.835
Alicia.

58:43.854 --> 58:47.022
Come say hello to your stepson,
Malcolm.

58:47.173 --> 58:50.025
Malcolm, your stepmother,
Alicia.

58:53.756 --> 58:55.197
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

58:55.424 --> 58:57.699
You didn't know that we were
with child.

59:01.872 --> 59:09.953
This is Mrs. Foxworth.
Mrs. Malcolm Neil Foxworth.

59:10.105 --> 59:10.963
Olivia.

59:11.882 --> 59:14.958
Olivia, welcome to our family.

59:15.052 --> 59:17.277
I... why didn't you tell me
he was married?

59:17.370 --> 59:18.720
Simply I had no idea, my love.

59:18.872 --> 59:20.371
[chuckles]

59:20.465 --> 59:21.798
He wrote only of business.

59:21.950 --> 59:23.392
Well, not only are you married

59:23.543 --> 59:26.044
you've also made me
a grandfather.

59:26.138 --> 59:27.062
Why didn't you tell me?

59:27.213 --> 59:29.139
Isn't it amusing
how one's priorities

59:29.291 --> 59:31.792
reveal themselves in the most
unusual ways.

59:31.810 --> 59:33.310
Yes. Well, it seems we have
both failed

59:33.462 --> 59:38.907
to disclose certain details....
about personal affairs.

59:39.743 --> 59:40.742
Mrs. Foxworth.

59:40.894 --> 59:42.035
Both: Yes?

59:45.082 --> 59:47.749
Dinner will be served shortly.

59:50.588 --> 59:52.162
How do you two do it?

59:52.256 --> 59:53.422
Excuse me?

59:53.573 --> 59:55.424
Sit so far apart from
one another?

59:55.575 --> 59:56.425
[chuckles]

59:58.095 --> 59:59.653
We're still on our honeymoon.

59:59.671 --> 1:00:01.096
When we've been married
as long as they have

1:00:01.247 --> 1:00:02.764
we'll be sitting
in separate rooms.

1:00:02.991 --> 1:00:03.748
Never.

1:00:03.767 --> 1:00:04.933
[laughs]

1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:07.436
Where exactly did you go
for your honeymoon?

1:00:07.587 --> 1:00:10.772
I promised my bride
a world tour,

1:00:10.999 --> 1:00:13.834
and a world tour she got.
Six continents.

1:00:13.852 --> 1:00:16.186
Nearly two years.

1:00:16.338 --> 1:00:17.838
How nice.

1:00:17.856 --> 1:00:20.598
Following through on promises
of travel.

1:00:22.010 --> 1:00:26.622
It's a long time to be away
from one's responsibilities.

1:00:26.849 --> 1:00:29.850
-Take it from an old man.
-You are not old.

1:00:29.868 --> 1:00:33.778
Life is too short to be focused
solely on responsibilities.

1:00:33.797 --> 1:00:35.355
And too long to bear
the burden

1:00:35.374 --> 1:00:37.466
of another's mishandling
of them.

1:00:39.119 --> 1:00:40.802
Well, like everything else
in life,

1:00:40.954 --> 1:00:43.639
is moderation not the key?

1:00:43.866 --> 1:00:46.642
Wise beyond her years,
is she not?

1:00:53.984 --> 1:00:57.468
Yes. Well, you will have
to tell us all about it.

1:00:57.488 --> 1:00:59.062
Your trip that is.

1:00:59.156 --> 1:01:01.490
Oh, we wouldn't want to bore you
with the details.

1:01:01.641 --> 1:01:04.901
Oh, on the contrary.
We want to listen.

1:01:04.995 --> 1:01:06.903
Don't we, Olivia?

1:01:07.055 --> 1:01:10.481
As long as you will be the one
who tells it.

1:01:10.501 --> 1:01:12.834
Oh, how sweet.

1:01:15.005 --> 1:01:18.581
Well, let's hear it,
perhaps over dessert.

1:01:18.676 --> 1:01:20.509
Alfresco?

1:01:20.660 --> 1:01:22.511
What a wonderful idea.

1:01:27.667 --> 1:01:30.519
See to it that the servants
bring dessert to the veranda.

1:01:30.746 --> 1:01:32.412
Understand?

1:01:32.431 --> 1:01:33.480
Yes.

1:01:40.439 --> 1:01:43.532
"Sit down please, sir."
The gondolier pleaded.

1:01:43.683 --> 1:01:45.091
You know your father,

1:01:45.185 --> 1:01:46.593
he'd had a great deal of wine

1:01:46.611 --> 1:01:48.261
and thought he could walk
a tightrope.

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:50.539
I simply wanted to navigate.

1:01:50.766 --> 1:01:52.599
And then what do
you think happened?

1:01:52.617 --> 1:01:53.875
He fell in.

1:01:57.122 --> 1:01:58.788
Well yes, exactly that.

1:01:58.882 --> 1:02:01.049
He fell in and it was complete
chaos all around.

1:02:01.201 --> 1:02:02.609
[Garland laughs]

1:02:02.702 --> 1:02:04.778
Have you ever been to Venice?

1:02:04.796 --> 1:02:06.221
I'm afraid not.

1:02:06.372 --> 1:02:08.390
Oh, but you must go.

1:02:08.541 --> 1:02:10.374
You can't stay locked up
in this castle.

1:02:10.394 --> 1:02:12.561
Are you keeping your princess
locked in the tower?

1:02:12.788 --> 1:02:16.639
You do not yet know my wife.
She is no princess.

1:02:16.734 --> 1:02:18.567
Then a queen.

1:02:18.718 --> 1:02:20.810
Shall we my love? Hmm?

1:02:20.963 --> 1:02:24.297
I think it might be time
to head to Bedfordshire.

1:02:24.316 --> 1:02:26.149
Mrs. Steiner will show you
to your rooms.

1:02:26.301 --> 1:02:29.152
Oh, that won't be necessary.
We'll be sharing.

1:02:29.246 --> 1:02:31.137
Sharing what?

1:02:31.231 --> 1:02:33.373
We'll be staying
in the same room.

1:02:37.496 --> 1:02:39.662
Really, father?

1:02:39.815 --> 1:02:41.648
Oh, don't be such a bore, son.

1:02:41.666 --> 1:02:44.926
I just couldn't bear to be away
from him all night.

1:02:45.078 --> 1:02:46.410
Well, then it's settled.

1:02:46.430 --> 1:02:48.597
Thank you so much
for a lovely evening.

1:02:48.824 --> 1:02:51.674
I cannot wait to do it
all over again tomorrow.

1:02:51.827 --> 1:02:54.585
<i>Olivia: Their joy only reminded</i>
<i> me of my pain.</i>

1:02:54.605 --> 1:02:56.496
<i> A pain that would be</i>
<i> there tomorrow</i>

1:02:56.589 --> 1:02:58.440
<i> and all the days after that.</i>

1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:04.004
<i> Olivia: Even in the darkest</i>
<i> of nights,</i>

1:03:04.097 --> 1:03:05.672
<i> there was the promise</i>
<i> of light to come.</i>

1:03:05.690 --> 1:03:09.618
<i> So, I focused on that light,</i>
<i> my children.</i>

1:03:11.363 --> 1:03:12.913
I hope it's okay.

1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:15.682
They're just so beautiful.

1:03:15.775 --> 1:03:17.042
It's fine.

1:03:18.945 --> 1:03:22.689
I don't want to be,
Mrs. Foxworth.

1:03:22.782 --> 1:03:27.285
Not, not in that way,
at least.

1:03:27.304 --> 1:03:30.121
You are mistress of this house
and thank goodness you are,

1:03:30.215 --> 1:03:32.365
because I could never do it.

1:03:32.458 --> 1:03:35.885
I am overwhelmed just thinking
about it.

1:03:36.038 --> 1:03:39.539
The only thing I ask of you
is your friendship.

1:03:39.632 --> 1:03:44.319
I've only been here a day
and I am already lonely.

1:03:44.470 --> 1:03:48.882
Well, it took you a day longer
than it took me when I arrived.

1:03:48.975 --> 1:03:53.069
I suppose I could use
a friend as well.

1:03:53.163 --> 1:03:54.496
Then it's settled.

1:03:54.723 --> 1:03:58.058
We're in this together.
The two Mrs. Foxworths.

1:03:58.076 --> 1:04:00.393
A word of advice.

1:04:00.486 --> 1:04:04.564
Malcolm absolutely
loathes hydrangeas.

1:04:04.657 --> 1:04:07.008
-Oh.
-Let's cut a few more.

1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:12.931
¶

1:04:14.167 --> 1:04:15.976
What are these doing here?

1:04:19.915 --> 1:04:22.357
Olivia, you know how I feel
about this.

1:04:25.103 --> 1:04:26.987
I thought you understood.

1:04:29.349 --> 1:04:31.199
I brought them in.

1:04:31.351 --> 1:04:33.927
I can take them away
if you'd like.

1:04:33.945 --> 1:04:34.870
No.

1:04:36.707 --> 1:04:38.874
Maybe they're not so bad

1:04:39.101 --> 1:04:42.952
when someone with an eye
for beauty picks them.

1:04:43.046 --> 1:04:45.881
<i> Olivia: As my affection for</i>
<i> my stepmother-in-law grew,</i>

1:04:46.032 --> 1:04:49.551
<i> so did my husband's interest</i>
<i> in his stepmother.</i>

1:04:51.204 --> 1:04:53.054
<i> But things were soon</i>
<i> to change.</i>

1:04:55.283 --> 1:04:57.967
[screaming in pain]

1:04:58.120 --> 1:04:59.877
One more. One more.

1:04:59.971 --> 1:05:03.714
[screaming in pain]

1:05:03.734 --> 1:05:05.625
Congratulations.

1:05:05.644 --> 1:05:07.819
You have a son.

1:05:09.131 --> 1:05:10.906
Congratulations, ma'am.

1:05:12.134 --> 1:05:13.074
Oh.

1:05:21.919 --> 1:05:22.918
Garland!

1:05:26.924 --> 1:05:30.592
It's a boy.
A perfect boy.

1:05:30.819 --> 1:05:33.244
Oh, my son.

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:36.656
My Christopher.
Why look at you.

1:05:36.749 --> 1:05:38.007
[laughing]

1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:40.827
Oh my love, my love.

1:05:40.845 --> 1:05:43.104
I'll give you two some time.

1:05:43.331 --> 1:05:45.014
As a family.

1:05:45.167 --> 1:05:48.276
Thank you for everything.

1:06:07.447 --> 1:06:09.113
Mrs. Foxworth, do you have
a moment?

1:06:09.132 --> 1:06:11.549
What is it, Nella?
Is there something wrong?

1:06:13.804 --> 1:06:15.470
It's the other Mrs. Foxworth.

1:06:15.697 --> 1:06:17.864
I see how fond of her
you've become.

1:06:17.957 --> 1:06:24.462
Yes. It's good to have a friend,
another friend.

1:06:24.481 --> 1:06:25.872
She's recovered so beautifully

1:06:25.890 --> 1:06:28.208
after the birth of Christopher
last year.

1:06:28.226 --> 1:06:29.300
Yes.

1:06:29.394 --> 1:06:32.112
That is the natural course
of things.

1:06:33.565 --> 1:06:35.824
Is there something I can
help you with?

1:06:36.994 --> 1:06:40.829
Mr. Foxworth enjoys
beautiful things.

1:06:41.056 --> 1:06:43.072
Houses.

1:06:43.225 --> 1:06:45.983
Art.

1:06:46.003 --> 1:06:47.085
Women.

1:06:48.913 --> 1:06:52.490
Like I said. The other
Mrs. Foxworth,

1:06:52.509 --> 1:06:56.660
she's returned to her
old self so quickly.

1:06:56.755 --> 1:06:59.514
-Look out for her.
-I will.

1:07:03.762 --> 1:07:11.651
<i> ¶</i>

1:07:18.035 --> 1:07:20.017
It's even worse in here.

1:07:20.037 --> 1:07:22.370
Are Virginia summers
always this hot?

1:07:22.597 --> 1:07:24.781
Foxworth Hall is
uniquely positioned

1:07:24.933 --> 1:07:28.359
as an inferno in the summer
and an icebox in the winter.

1:07:28.378 --> 1:07:31.713
Yet another of its remarkable
gifts to us.

1:07:31.940 --> 1:07:34.274
Well, I just put Christopher
down for his nap.

1:07:34.292 --> 1:07:36.459
Would you like to go
for a swim in the lake?

1:07:36.611 --> 1:07:38.369
You go and cool off
for us both.

1:07:38.463 --> 1:07:40.555
I'd like to finish up here.

1:07:40.706 --> 1:07:41.973
Of course.

1:07:52.460 --> 1:07:54.360

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:18.334
[knocking at door]

1:08:18.428 --> 1:08:20.095
Come in, Nella.

1:08:23.658 --> 1:08:25.842
Good evening, Mrs. Foxworth.

1:08:25.936 --> 1:08:29.604
I'll be helping you until
we find Nella's replacement.

1:08:29.831 --> 1:08:32.107
What are you talking about?
Where has she gone?

1:08:33.426 --> 1:08:35.944
Why Mr. Foxworth asked her
to leave.

1:08:36.171 --> 1:08:37.019
Did he?

1:08:37.172 --> 1:08:39.096
And why might he have
done that?

1:08:39.116 --> 1:08:41.341
I couldn't say, Mrs. Foxworth.

1:08:41.359 --> 1:08:44.193
Interesting how you're suddenly
at a loss for words

1:08:44.346 --> 1:08:47.288
when they usually come
so very easily to you.

1:08:55.023 --> 1:08:55.964
Malcolm?

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:05.882
<i> [Alicia screaming]</i>
<i> No!</i>

1:09:05.976 --> 1:09:07.200
What happened?

1:09:07.293 --> 1:09:09.144
Whatever it is, it's none
of your concern.

1:09:13.150 --> 1:09:14.149
[Alicia sobbing hysterically]

1:09:14.376 --> 1:09:15.733
Oh, my god!

1:09:17.379 --> 1:09:20.304
[sobbing]
Call the doctor!
Call the doctor!

1:09:20.398 --> 1:09:23.491
[sobbing]
Oh my god, my love.

1:09:23.643 --> 1:09:25.076
I'll call.

1:09:26.663 --> 1:09:28.237
What happened?

1:09:28.390 --> 1:09:32.750
[sobbing]
My love, please wake up.
Please. Don't leave me.

1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:42.343
¶

1:09:59.270 --> 1:10:02.513
Hopefully, we'll have some
answers for the poor woman

1:10:02.607 --> 1:10:04.532
after the autopsy.

1:10:09.188 --> 1:10:10.688
The thing is, Doctor.

1:10:10.707 --> 1:10:16.193
Well, Mrs. Foxworth has
already been through so much.

1:10:16.213 --> 1:10:19.455
I don't think she could handle
the idea of an autopsy.

1:10:19.607 --> 1:10:22.884
You see, would you be so kind

1:10:23.035 --> 1:10:26.554
not to put her through
even more trauma?

1:10:26.781 --> 1:10:29.206
I'm sure Mr. Foxworth and I
would find a way

1:10:29.226 --> 1:10:31.559
to show our appreciation
to your hospital.

1:10:31.711 --> 1:10:35.563
I hear they're raising money
for a new emergent patient area.

1:10:38.068 --> 1:10:39.067
Certainly.

1:10:41.479 --> 1:10:43.029
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:10:44.632 --> 1:10:47.533
-Good night, Mrs. Foxworth.
-Good night.

1:10:57.921 --> 1:10:58.920
Olivia.

1:11:11.434 --> 1:11:16.679
<i> Olivia: And so Foxworth Hall</i>
<i> claimed its first victim.</i>

1:11:16.831 --> 1:11:21.776
<i> The only question was,</i>
<i> who would be next?</i>

1:11:23.671 --> 1:11:28.950
<i> After a few months, it</i>
<i> appeared to be Alicia.</i>

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:33.529
If you won't touch
your food downstairs

1:11:33.623 --> 1:11:36.624
I thought maybe you'd consider
breakfast in bed.

1:11:38.611 --> 1:11:41.629
Just a few more days of quiet,
please.

1:11:41.856 --> 1:11:45.858
It's been over four months
of quiet.

1:11:45.877 --> 1:11:48.377
Olivia. My husband is dead.

1:11:48.530 --> 1:11:50.638
But your son is not.

1:11:53.459 --> 1:11:54.809
He needs you.

1:11:55.979 --> 1:11:57.537
You don't understand.

1:11:57.555 --> 1:12:00.206
No, I don't.

1:12:00.299 --> 1:12:02.466
And I can't unless
you tell me.

1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:04.652
Help me understand.

1:12:06.138 --> 1:12:08.323
[whispering]
You must know.

1:12:08.474 --> 1:12:10.825
Surely you sensed it.

1:12:13.496 --> 1:12:15.330
Must I say it?

1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:24.005
Malcolm attacked me.

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:30.160
He came in here and he forced
himself on me.

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:34.256
I tried to resist
but he wouldn't stop.

1:12:34.351 --> 1:12:37.185
He just tore my nightgown
when Garland walked in.

1:12:39.356 --> 1:12:44.359
Garland swung at Malcolm
but he was no match for him.

1:12:44.586 --> 1:12:47.820
But pinned him up against
the wall and...

1:12:51.776 --> 1:12:53.534
held him there.

1:12:57.615 --> 1:12:59.540
You know what happened next.

1:13:02.194 --> 1:13:04.361
I'm sorry.

1:13:04.381 --> 1:13:07.531
Truly.

1:13:07.550 --> 1:13:09.609
But it's over now.

1:13:09.702 --> 1:13:13.963
Let's never speak of it again.

1:13:14.057 --> 1:13:16.557
It's not over.

1:13:16.709 --> 1:13:19.894
Malcolm's visits,
they didn't stop.

1:13:20.121 --> 1:13:23.139
After Garland's death,
Malcolm has come to you?

1:13:23.233 --> 1:13:26.192
He told me if I resisted
he would hurt Christopher.

1:13:29.054 --> 1:13:32.723
And then he would
become different.

1:13:32.817 --> 1:13:35.576
Before he forced himself
on me,

1:13:35.803 --> 1:13:38.487
I know this sounds strange,
but...

1:13:38.581 --> 1:13:40.898
[whispering] He would take you
to his mother's room?

1:13:41.476 --> 1:13:42.875
[whispering]
Yes.

1:13:50.501 --> 1:13:52.501
[crying]
You should go.

1:13:52.654 --> 1:13:53.594
What?

1:13:56.658 --> 1:13:57.932
You are my friend, Alicia

1:13:58.083 --> 1:14:01.769
and it pains me to say this...
but go.

1:14:01.996 --> 1:14:04.105
You have the freedom
to leave this place.

1:14:04.256 --> 1:14:08.276
Take your son and your
inheritance and start over.

1:14:08.427 --> 1:14:14.932
You're young and beautiful
and rich.

1:14:15.026 --> 1:14:17.243
It's not too late for you.

1:14:22.684 --> 1:14:24.292
But it is too late.

1:14:26.946 --> 1:14:28.629
I'm pregnant.

1:14:28.856 --> 1:14:32.525
<i> ¶</i>

1:14:32.543 --> 1:14:36.045
It's his, Olivia.

1:14:36.197 --> 1:14:37.213
It's his.

<i> In that moment I finally knew</i>

We'll be having

1:16:34.165 --> 1:16:36.757

Mrs. Foxworth!

1:17:02.935 --> 1:17:04.452
Are you all right?

1:17:04.679 --> 1:17:05.511
Oh.

1:17:05.529 --> 1:17:06.846
Yes.

1:17:06.939 --> 1:17:08.939
Don't worry,
it's not mine.

1:17:08.958 --> 1:17:11.367
Nella, I need your help.

1:17:11.461 --> 1:17:14.111
I don't have time right now
to explain everything.

1:17:14.130 --> 1:17:18.374
But you were treated very poorly
and for that I'm truly sorry.

1:17:18.468 --> 1:17:22.211
Will you come to Foxworth Hall
tomorrow morning?

1:17:22.363 --> 1:17:24.530
Please?

1:17:24.548 --> 1:17:25.473
Yes.

1:17:25.624 --> 1:17:28.601
Thank you. Thank you.

1:17:41.382 --> 1:17:42.490
[exhales]

1:17:43.493 --> 1:17:47.495
It's okay. She's gone.

1:17:47.722 --> 1:17:50.072
Why did you never tell her
about me?

1:17:50.224 --> 1:17:52.892
Well, I didn't want to hurt her.
She's my friend.

1:17:52.910 --> 1:17:54.985
She's not your friend, Mama.

1:17:55.004 --> 1:17:56.729
And you're not going back
to that place.

1:17:56.747 --> 1:17:59.298
Mind your mouth, Celia.

1:18:03.587 --> 1:18:06.238
Mrs. Steiner, this lamb
was perfection.

1:18:06.331 --> 1:18:08.240
Tell Cook she has
outdone herself.

1:18:08.259 --> 1:18:10.000
I was hoping you'd like it.

1:18:10.019 --> 1:18:11.927
<i> Olivia: I gave him his</i>
<i> prized lamb.</i>

1:18:12.079 --> 1:18:15.022
<i> Before I took everything else.</i>

1:18:15.249 --> 1:18:19.026
It is a pity Alicia didn't
join us this evening.

1:18:19.178 --> 1:18:20.861
Did she say why?

1:18:21.013 --> 1:18:24.699
I don't think she'll be
joining us for some time.

1:18:25.927 --> 1:18:29.428
Mourning. It's a process.

1:18:29.447 --> 1:18:31.872
[thunder rumbles]

1:18:35.286 --> 1:18:38.379
Well... I will be
in the library working.

1:18:38.606 --> 1:18:39.863
I would prefer not
to be disturbed.

1:18:39.882 --> 1:18:41.031
Do you understand?

1:18:41.125 --> 1:18:42.883
Oh, I certainly do.

1:19:15.659 --> 1:19:17.901
You called?

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.312
What the hell is your desk
doing here?

1:19:20.331 --> 1:19:22.423
I've made some changes.

1:19:25.987 --> 1:19:30.890
This is my house and I will
not tolerate such insolence.

1:19:35.587 --> 1:19:38.088
What do you think
you're doing?

1:19:38.182 --> 1:19:40.107
I'm having a drink.

1:19:42.094 --> 1:19:44.019
But what have you been doing?

1:19:44.171 --> 1:19:47.097
And why have you
been doing it?

1:19:47.116 --> 1:19:49.283
Let's start at the beginning,
shall we?

1:19:51.529 --> 1:19:52.678
What is this all about?

1:19:52.771 --> 1:19:54.696
It's about how we
move forward.

1:19:54.849 --> 1:19:57.516
If we move forward.

1:19:57.535 --> 1:19:59.585
Please, sit.

1:20:02.965 --> 1:20:05.966
[thunder rumbles]

1:20:07.970 --> 1:20:09.637
Excellent.

1:20:09.864 --> 1:20:11.138
Now...

1:20:11.290 --> 1:20:12.932
Why did you marry me?

1:20:13.959 --> 1:20:15.292
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1:20:15.311 --> 1:20:18.962
Oh, we passed ridiculous
long ago.

1:20:19.056 --> 1:20:22.057
If all you wanted in a wife was
a member of your staff to abuse,

1:20:22.151 --> 1:20:25.468
you could've picked someone
easier to silence.

1:20:25.563 --> 1:20:27.655
So, why did you marry me?

1:20:29.992 --> 1:20:30.991
Fine.

1:20:33.220 --> 1:20:35.554
I wanted a woman with a mind
to manage the house

1:20:35.573 --> 1:20:38.481
and a body to produce
healthy offspring.

1:20:38.501 --> 1:20:42.169
Sadly my observations of your
talents were only half correct.

1:20:42.396 --> 1:20:49.492
Two children, both boys,
and weak boys at that.

1:20:49.512 --> 1:20:51.178
Now is that all?

1:20:51.405 --> 1:20:52.179
No.

1:20:54.075 --> 1:20:57.242
It will be here
in nine months.

1:20:57.261 --> 1:20:58.185
Excuse me?

1:20:58.412 --> 1:21:00.170
Your child.

1:21:00.189 --> 1:21:02.857
The child you are having
with your stepmother.

1:21:06.437 --> 1:21:07.695
-Alicia?
-She's pregnant.

1:21:07.846 --> 1:21:10.013
Yes. Congratulations.

1:21:10.032 --> 1:21:12.941
You're the father
and the stepbrother.

1:21:13.094 --> 1:21:16.370
It's all a bit confusing,
really.

1:21:16.521 --> 1:21:17.930
How wonderful.

1:21:17.948 --> 1:21:19.431
How odd of you to say that.

1:21:19.450 --> 1:21:20.933
It is a girl.
I know it.

1:21:21.026 --> 1:21:22.434
It's a bastard
is all we know.

1:21:22.453 --> 1:21:26.380
Oh wait, I apologize.
That's not all we know.

1:21:26.531 --> 1:21:29.866
We know you have your father's
blood on your hands.

1:21:29.960 --> 1:21:31.276
This conversation is over.

1:21:31.295 --> 1:21:34.537
Oh, Malcolm, this conversation
is just beginning.

1:21:34.557 --> 1:21:36.873
[thunder rumbles]

1:21:36.967 --> 1:21:40.285
Your stepmother is only in the
early stages of her pregnancy.

1:21:40.304 --> 1:21:42.730
It will be impossible
to maintain appearances

1:21:42.881 --> 1:21:44.623
by saying the child
is Garland's.

1:21:44.642 --> 1:21:45.974
We send her away for a year

1:21:46.127 --> 1:21:47.809
and no one will be able
to tell how old the child is

1:21:47.904 --> 1:21:48.402
when they return.

1:21:48.629 --> 1:21:50.053
I would.

1:21:50.147 --> 1:21:52.648
I'd be able to tell.

1:21:52.742 --> 1:21:53.741
You wouldn't.

1:21:53.892 --> 1:21:55.743
Well, I wouldn't tell
that secret

1:21:55.894 --> 1:21:57.912
because that would make me
look bad.

1:21:58.063 --> 1:22:01.248
A woman who permits her husband
to sleep with his stepmother?

1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:03.475
Ghastly, really.

1:22:03.568 --> 1:22:05.978
I thought you knew me better
than that.

1:22:05.996 --> 1:22:10.573
But I would tell everyone
about how Garland died.

1:22:10.668 --> 1:22:13.093
About how you killed him.

1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:14.319
You lie.

1:22:14.338 --> 1:22:16.822
You attacked his wife.
He found you.

1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:17.839
You held him against a wall

1:22:17.992 --> 1:22:19.600
until he could
no longer breathe.

1:22:19.751 --> 1:22:20.842
He had a heart attack.

1:22:20.995 --> 1:22:22.678
He had a heart attack
because I decided he did

1:22:22.830 --> 1:22:26.756
when I convinced the good doctor
not to perform an autopsy.

1:22:26.776 --> 1:22:27.775
What do you want?!

1:22:27.926 --> 1:22:30.611
I want to destroy you.

1:22:30.762 --> 1:22:35.174
I want to ruin your business,
your reputation, your name.

1:22:35.267 --> 1:22:37.359
But I can't do that, can I?

1:22:37.453 --> 1:22:40.012
I have the unfortunate privilege
of sharing that name.

1:22:40.105 --> 1:22:42.848
A stain on you,
is a stain on me.

1:22:42.866 --> 1:22:44.583
You should be grateful.

1:22:46.462 --> 1:22:48.187
[thunder rumbles]

1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:50.205
Alicia's bags will be packed

1:22:50.357 --> 1:22:54.117
and she'll be sent away for
all the servants to witness.

1:22:54.136 --> 1:22:57.713
Once night falls,
Alicia will return.

1:22:57.807 --> 1:23:01.141
We'll keep her here in seclusion
in the East Wing

1:23:01.293 --> 1:23:03.310
for the duration
of her pregnancy.

1:23:03.462 --> 1:23:06.480
The servants will not be
permitted anywhere near her.

1:23:06.707 --> 1:23:08.631
And while we're on the subject
of servants,

1:23:08.651 --> 1:23:10.392
Nella will be returning.

1:23:10.544 --> 1:23:12.060
Why?

1:23:12.213 --> 1:23:13.988
Because I like her.

1:23:15.974 --> 1:23:18.158
Excellent. I'm glad you agree.

1:23:18.310 --> 1:23:22.287
After all, I'll be needing
her help when I'm with child.

1:23:23.815 --> 1:23:24.665
Excuse me?

1:23:25.984 --> 1:23:27.835
I thought you would've
caught on by now.

1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:34.657
We'll announce to the staff the
happy news that I'm expecting.

1:23:34.677 --> 1:23:38.070
I'll pretend to be pregnant
both in the house and in public.

1:23:38.088 --> 1:23:39.571
When Alicia's child is born

1:23:39.590 --> 1:23:42.165
we will keep it and raise it
as our own.

1:23:42.259 --> 1:23:44.743
No one will be the wiser.

1:23:44.762 --> 1:23:47.246
And Alicia?

1:23:47.339 --> 1:23:49.431
Your stepmother will be
sent away

1:23:49.583 --> 1:23:51.841
along with young Christopher
and her inheritance,

1:23:51.861 --> 1:23:54.936
which you will double
immediately following the birth.

1:23:55.089 --> 1:23:55.696
How da...

1:23:55.847 --> 1:23:57.531
Did I say I was done?!

1:23:57.682 --> 1:23:59.199
You will not be permitted
in the East Wing

1:23:59.351 --> 1:24:02.018
for the duration of your
stepmother's confinement.

1:24:02.038 --> 1:24:03.871
If news of you breaking this
rule comes to my attention

1:24:04.022 --> 1:24:05.039
the agreement is off.

1:24:05.190 --> 1:24:07.541
I tell everyone the truth.

1:24:07.692 --> 1:24:09.192
You wouldn't.

1:24:09.211 --> 1:24:11.694
Oh, Malcolm, I would.

1:24:11.714 --> 1:24:14.289
I would burn this place
to the ground.

1:24:14.383 --> 1:24:17.384
[thunder rumbles]

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:24.800
Now is that all?

1:24:24.952 --> 1:24:26.894
Just one more thing.

1:24:27.045 --> 1:24:30.731
Tomorrow you will set up trusts
for the boys.

1:24:30.882 --> 1:24:32.882
Two million dollars.

1:24:32.902 --> 1:24:34.476
Each.

1:24:34.628 --> 1:24:38.221
The trusts will be theirs
to do with as they please

1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:42.984
so they may be free of you
and this godforsaken house.

1:24:43.079 --> 1:24:43.985

1:24:44.138 --> 1:24:46.488
[gasps]

1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:48.156
That temper!

1:24:48.309 --> 1:24:50.250
Now, I see how you must
have driven your mother

1:24:50.402 --> 1:24:53.903
to run away all those
years ago.

1:24:53.923 --> 1:24:54.830
How dare you?!

1:24:54.982 --> 1:24:57.049
You raped me.
How dare you?

1:25:03.265 --> 1:25:04.414
I won't do it.

1:25:04.433 --> 1:25:06.100
Oh, but you will.

1:25:07.436 --> 1:25:09.603
Do you understand?

1:25:13.016 --> 1:25:14.757
That's not good enough.

1:25:14.852 --> 1:25:16.184
Do you understand?!

1:25:16.337 --> 1:25:17.111
I do!

1:25:37.708 --> 1:25:39.466
