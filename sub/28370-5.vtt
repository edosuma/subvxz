WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:03.829
Feel the textures of my beauty.[laughs]

00:03.873 --> 00:05.788
Previously onIn The Dark...

00:05.831 --> 00:07.007
Oh, my God.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.965
Tyson. Help!

00:09.009 --> 00:11.011
So what were you doing
in the alley?

00:11.054 --> 00:12.012
We were friends.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.056
I'm his father.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.231
I found Tyson lying dead.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.016
No, that's impossible.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.669
What I do know is that he
skipped town for good.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.063
Quit his job at the flower shop,
sold his stuff and everything.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.151
I've never done this before.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.892
What?Dated anyone.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.676
But I sort of want
to try that with you.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.549
Tyson witnessed the Crawford
murder, and you didn't tell me.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.159
You know we got to
keep work out of this.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.379
It's better for both of us.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.250
Yeah.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.176
Are you hungry again?Always.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.222
Can you open this?
Yeah.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.009
Here.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.664
Thank you.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.014
Oh, God, don't eat that.
That expired, like, a week ago.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.147
Tastes good, like a fine wine.

01:00.190 --> 01:04.151
Is that how you stay so thin?
Eat rotting food?

01:04.194 --> 01:05.717
You know, Tyson's dad said
he talked to Tyson

01:05.761 --> 01:08.329
a couple days ago, but...
I know I felt him in the alley.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.982
It... It doesn't make sense.

01:10.026 --> 01:13.116
Also not making sense, Tyson
worked at a flower shop?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.249
Exactly. Like,
what flower shop?

01:15.292 --> 01:17.773
Like... when? Why?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.122
Dude, you're asking me
like I know

01:19.166 --> 01:20.558
the answers to
these questions.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.343
Oh, tampons.
I need tampons.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.127
And so do you, actually,
because I used your last one

01:24.171 --> 01:26.564
this morning, sorry.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.479
[grunts]
Super plus.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.046
How do you wear these things?

01:30.090 --> 01:33.136
It feels like I have
a tiny penis inside of me.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.530
Wait, we're not
on our periods yet.
I am.

01:35.573 --> 01:38.924
I'm, like, two days in.
Oh, God.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.491
Are you late? Please
don't tell me you're late.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.189
It's probably stress.Murphy...

01:42.232 --> 01:44.104
I've taken so many
morning-after pills,

01:44.147 --> 01:46.584
if I'm not infertile
by this point, I'm suing them.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.934
We can't have a baby.I can feel the blood
brewing in me.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.067
Okay? I've been late before.
It's nothing.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.114
Come on.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.246
I'm so lucky I don't have
to deal with this whole

01:56.290 --> 01:57.595
pregnancy scare stuff.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.076
Thank you for flaunting
your gay privilege.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.644
Anytime.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.082
Hey, Chels, can you top me off?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.649
Of course.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.955
How's it, uh, how's it going
with the tech guy?

02:09.999 --> 02:11.392
Uh, okay.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.871
I mean, I haven't heard
from him in, like, a week.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.438
He was really busy, and then
his sister was in town...

02:14.482 --> 02:16.223
Oh, sweet Chelsea.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.094
He's boning somebody else,
isn't he?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.617
He's definitely boning
someone else.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.446
Cool. Should I just
kill myself now, or...?[laughs]

02:22.490 --> 02:24.056
Who's gonna pour me my drinks?

02:24.100 --> 02:25.275
Oh, that's right.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.450
I'll live for you.MAN: Hey, Chelsea.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.756
I'm gonna go pour
this guy his drink.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.149
Hey.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.324
[clears throat]
It's Dean.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.110
Kind of I thought
I might find you here.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.112
Really using those
detective skills.[chuckles]

02:36.156 --> 02:39.159
Hey, I got your message
about Tyson's dad.

02:39.202 --> 02:42.249
About how I'm doing your job
ten times better than you are.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.772
Actually, I came to tell
you that I have a lead.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.077
So, no, you're not.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.210
A lead?
Yeah.

02:47.254 --> 02:52.215
A, uh, rival dealer was shot,
and Tyson was there.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.348
You think this rival
drug dealer killed Tyson?

02:54.391 --> 02:57.133
No, I-- Based on what you
told me about Tyson's dad,

02:57.177 --> 03:00.223
I think maybe this dealer's
people drove Tyson out of town.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
Oh.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.184
Hey.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.359
Can I get you a drink?

03:05.402 --> 03:07.404
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll have a... a beer.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.972
We have, like, 50.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.800
Oh. Okay.
[chuckling]

03:11.843 --> 03:13.367
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's not much of a drinker.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.846
Oh...

03:14.890 --> 03:16.065
I drink.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.023
I'll, uh, have a...

03:18.067 --> 03:19.677
No, wait.
Don't. Let me pick.

03:19.721 --> 03:20.678
I'm, like, really good at this.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.724
Okay.Okay.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.901
That's exciting.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.250
Okay.

03:27.294 --> 03:30.384
This is a local brew,
double IPA.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.037
It's my personal favorite.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.387
Ooh.

03:37.608 --> 03:40.263
Mmm. That is tasty.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.482
Oh, you hate it.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.092
He hates it.
He hates it.
No, no, no, no.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.354
I love it. Truly.
Thank you.
Okay.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.661
I'll be right back.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.097
So, you want to do it?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.186
Excuse me?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.840
Chelsea, the bartender.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.189
I can totally make that happen.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.364
[laughs]
No, I, uh...

03:54.408 --> 03:56.323
If you want.
If you're down.
I'm good.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.934
But, um... you know,
I'm hungry.

03:58.977 --> 03:59.935
You want to get a bite?

03:59.978 --> 04:02.329
Hi, babe.Right now?

04:03.199 --> 04:05.288
Hey. [clears throat]

04:05.332 --> 04:09.292
Sorry. Uh, Dean,
this is my... boyfriend.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.730
It's still hard for her to say.A little bit.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.297
Oh, I'm Max.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.343
It's nice to meet you.Yeah. You, too.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.519
Ready to go?
Yeah.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.477
Will you let me know if you
find out anything else?

04:20.521 --> 04:23.219
Yeah.Okay. All right. See you.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.351
Yeah.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.355
What is this?

04:28.398 --> 04:29.356
It's a Shirley Temple.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.705
[chuckles]

04:30.748 --> 04:33.273
It's more your speed.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.062
â™ª

04:46.851 --> 04:48.940
Really, really tired.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.420
I'll be quick.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.770
Come on, come on.
it'll only take, like, five....

04:52.814 --> 04:55.338
Oh, that's a
ringing endorsement.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.430
All right. Okay.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.519
Okay, good night.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.738
I'll go to sleep.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.350
Good night.

05:26.543 --> 05:28.502
Is there blood?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.854
I think we might be too close.
This isn't even weird.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.377
Well, is there blood?

05:34.421 --> 05:35.596
Nothing.
[sighs]

05:41.732 --> 05:44.344
Do my boobs look bigger?
Feel them.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.694
Okay, that's where
I draw the line.

05:46.737 --> 05:47.695
Do my boobs look bigger.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.566
Be a grown up. Take a test.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.438
[mocking]:
Be a grown-up. Take a test.

05:51.481 --> 05:55.006
You just refuse to look because
they're better than Vanessa's!

05:57.574 --> 05:58.923
No, they're not.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.100
Bitch.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.885
You're short 15K.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.365
That's almost half
your haul.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.977
I know.
I've got it handled.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.195
You know, you've
been off your game

06:10.239 --> 06:11.675
since that cousin of
yours went missing.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.678
Would you care to explain
to me why your money boy is

06:14.722 --> 06:16.506
running around
with that blind girl?

06:17.464 --> 06:19.335
They were hooking up.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.902
I thought it ended
a couple weeks ago.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.382
Well, it didn't.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.559
I might be in here,
but that don't mean

06:25.602 --> 06:27.474
I ain't got eyes out there.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.606
I'm looking at 20 years if
they pin me for racketeering.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.608
The last thing I want is
somebody poking around

06:31.652 --> 06:34.481
in my business while I'm
waiting on my trial date.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.482
So take care of it.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.048
Yeah.
Look at me!

06:40.356 --> 06:42.097
Take care of it.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.533
I got it.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.451
All right.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.019
Oh, by the way, I gave
Wesley a few blocks

06:51.062 --> 06:52.324
to try him out these
past couple weeks.

06:52.368 --> 06:55.153
Wesley?
You got to be kidding me.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.460
He's a loose cannon.
Kid's not serious.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.507
He's moving major product.
He's a good soldier.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.901
You know, if I were you,
I'd step it up, Darnell.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.729
On all fronts.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.434
"Clover Flora." No.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.044
How many flower shops
can there possibly be?

07:16.087 --> 07:18.089
Shh. I'm Yelping.[phone buzzes]

07:18.133 --> 07:20.744
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Incoming call from Max.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.576
I take it that you're not

07:26.620 --> 07:28.273
telling baby daddy
what's going on?

07:28.317 --> 07:30.928
[scoffs]Murphy, I don't understand
why you refuse

07:30.972 --> 07:31.929
to take a test.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.278
Because I'm not going to.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.498
I'm barely late, okay?
Drop it.

07:37.761 --> 07:41.852
Okay. Company time.
Company computer.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.637
Is this company work?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.290
Is this the company loser?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.249
Rules are rules. Okay?
[knuckles cracking]

07:47.292 --> 07:48.685
Are you okay?

07:48.729 --> 07:50.426
You're cracking a lot
more than usual.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.297
Knuckles or neck?
Knuckles.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.734
Gross.
Guys, I'm right here.

07:53.777 --> 07:57.346
And if you must know,
my Uncle Ralph

07:57.389 --> 07:59.174
is in hospice
at my mom's house,

07:59.217 --> 08:00.654
and he's getting worse.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.177
So, he only has
a couple days,

08:02.220 --> 08:03.352
if we're lucky,

08:03.395 --> 08:04.353
so I'm driving up
to Winnetka tonight.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.094
Oh, Felix, I'm so sorry.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.488
It is what it is.

08:10.577 --> 08:15.233
I'm walking out the front now,
so wait at least 20 minutes.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.847
D? You good?

08:19.890 --> 08:21.805
Huh?

08:21.849 --> 08:24.547
Uh, yeah, yeah. Just...

08:24.591 --> 08:27.202
Ugh, I thought I was done

08:27.245 --> 08:29.944
sneaking out of girls'
houses at 15.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.598
Whose house were you
sneaking out of at 15?

08:31.641 --> 08:33.034
Chantal Williams.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.601
[laughs]

08:34.644 --> 08:37.038
What?She's gay.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.996
Oh, there you go.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.173
You did have
a delicate frame back then.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.176
Come on, I'm serious.

08:45.220 --> 08:49.877
What if we... drove out some
place nobody knows us?

08:49.920 --> 08:52.096
We could go to dinner.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.795
I could actually hold
your hand in public.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.146
Hold hands?

08:58.189 --> 09:00.322
Yeah.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.280
Is that how far you got
with Chantal Williams?

09:02.324 --> 09:04.805
Let me take you out.

09:07.024 --> 09:09.157
I could use a distraction.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.556
Yeah, okay.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.122
â™ª

09:18.166 --> 09:19.254
All right, uh...

09:19.297 --> 09:20.951
I have a good feeling
about this one.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.214
Well, you said that about
the last three places.

09:23.258 --> 09:26.000
I'm trying
to remain positive.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.176
[sighs] Honestly, I don't even
get the whole flower thing.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.700
They die after two days, and
then they just smell like vomit.

09:30.744 --> 09:33.398
Well, they're pretty.
Vanessa loves them.

09:33.442 --> 09:37.489
Yeah, she's also the most basic
person I've ever met in my life.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.404
Can I help you guys?
Yes.

09:39.448 --> 09:40.667
Hi, we were wondering if anyone

09:40.710 --> 09:42.407
named Tyson Parker
used to work here.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.757
Tyson? Beanie kid.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.715
Yes. So he did work here?

09:45.759 --> 09:47.543
He did, yeah. Why?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.763
Oh, um... I-I'm looking for him.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.374
Well, uh, I haven't
seen him lately.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.985
He stopped showing up
a couple weeks ago.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.900
Okay, um...

09:56.944 --> 09:59.424
Well, do you know anything
about him being, like,

09:59.468 --> 10:01.818
scared of someone,
or running away, or anything?

10:01.862 --> 10:04.342
Uh... he just delivered
flowers for me.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.388
We didn't get that deep.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.303
Okay. Uh, do you--I have a customer.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.957
Unless you guys are
gonna buy something.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.698
Oh, no.
Yes.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.351
Uh, do you have any dahlias?

10:13.395 --> 10:14.352
They're my girlfriend's
favorite.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.832
Over here.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.748
Oh, God.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.451
Okay.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.931
All right, so, uh...

10:27.975 --> 10:29.454
well, what-what do we do now?

10:29.498 --> 10:31.152
I mean, maybe what
Dean said is true,

10:31.195 --> 10:33.023
and some rival drug
dealer or something

10:33.067 --> 10:34.634
scared Tyson out of town.
I don't know.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.637
Right, which would mean he was
unconscious when you found him

10:37.680 --> 10:40.378
in the alley, and then
he just came to and took off?

10:40.422 --> 10:41.728
Maybe. I don't know.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.819
I just know he felt,
like, so dead.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.777
Well, you don't know
what a dead person feels like.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.084
I mean, it's not like you've
felt any other dead people.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.433
Yeah.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.656
Wait, that's it.What?

10:56.699 --> 10:59.354
You're right, I need
to feel another dead body.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.357
Okay.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.494
This place better be nice.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.018
These heels are killing me.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.498
You look beautiful.

11:13.542 --> 11:17.285
Just wait till you taste
their lasagna bolognese.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.808
[chuckles]:
Ah...

11:18.852 --> 11:22.682
I got us a hotel room, too.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.074
Look at you.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.163
You're really doing it up.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.469
[chuckles]

11:27.512 --> 11:29.471
And you don't look
so bad yourself.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.560
[phone ringing]Hang on one sec, baby.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.344
WESLEY:
We got a tip.Hello?

11:33.388 --> 11:35.390
The cops are busting our spot
on Carver tonight.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.435
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.005
Yeah.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.747
This is unbelievable.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.575
I can't pretend
I didn't just hear that.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.404
You have to.

11:49.447 --> 11:50.710
You need to drop me off
right here.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.276
I can't, all right?
We're on the highway.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.496
Darnell!A'ight, a'ight.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.324
â™ª You make it easy...

11:56.367 --> 11:58.630
â™ª To love you.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.418
DARNELL:
Jules...

12:07.248 --> 12:09.032
I'm sorry, Jules.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.642
Darnell, drive away.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.829
TYSON:
So, D,

12:22.872 --> 12:24.787
I have a plan.

12:24.831 --> 12:28.356
Oh, yeah? And
what's that?

12:28.399 --> 12:31.707
Okay, see this neighborhood?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.230
Mm-hmm.

12:33.274 --> 12:35.319
See that new juice store
that just opened up?

12:35.363 --> 12:37.713
All they sell is juice.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.888
[laughs]

12:38.932 --> 12:40.716
And that's it.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.242
New people are moving in, and
they want something different.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.809
â™ª Something you gonna
have to live with... â™ª

12:46.853 --> 12:50.030
I was thinking
we could give that to them.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.032
â™ª Know I got it for you
if you ever need it... â™ª

12:52.075 --> 12:53.424
Nah, man.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.644
If we start getting
into new stuff,

12:55.687 --> 12:59.866
finding new suppliers
we don't know if we can trust...

12:59.909 --> 13:02.477
it's not doable.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.522
â™ª Starting off a new day...

13:04.566 --> 13:06.350
All right.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.745
I like where
your head's at, though.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.009
That kind of thinking will
get you somewhere, huh?

13:15.055 --> 13:17.187
So I called the morgue
to see if I could, uh,

13:17.231 --> 13:19.102
feel a dead person.
Guess what they said?

13:19.146 --> 13:22.410
Hmm. I'm gonna, uh, go out
on a limb here and say "No."

13:22.453 --> 13:24.455
Yes, they said no,
but how-how am I gonna

13:24.499 --> 13:25.848
get my hands on a dead body?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.850
[both mouthing]

13:30.418 --> 13:32.115
Hey, don't. I hate when you guys

13:32.159 --> 13:33.421
do that. Stop it.Okay, um,

13:33.464 --> 13:35.423
why do you want
to molest a cadaver?

13:35.466 --> 13:37.512
Because she's, uh, crazy.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.340
Yeah, I know,
but seriously, why?

13:39.383 --> 13:41.559
No. Just don't worry about it.
It's a long story.

13:41.603 --> 13:42.822
Yeah.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.649
[phone buzzing]Oh, hang on.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.521
Oh, it's Felix.

13:46.564 --> 13:49.872
Hang on, we'll, we'll, you
know, talk about this later.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.221
Hello?

13:51.265 --> 13:52.527
Chels, can I get some wings?

13:52.570 --> 13:53.615
You don't actually eat
those, do you?

13:53.658 --> 13:54.964
Yeah.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.618
You know that all we have
back there is a cooler

13:56.661 --> 13:57.488
and a microwave, right?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.535
Yeah.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.797
Gross.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.103
JESS:
All right, okay, yep.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.365
Okay, bye-bye.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.149
[clears throat, exhales]

14:06.193 --> 14:08.238
That was Felix.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.110
He needs me to open up Guiding
Hope next week for him.

14:10.153 --> 14:13.504
Sounds like his uncle is not
even gonna last the night.

14:13.548 --> 14:17.073
That really sucks.Yeah.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.904
No.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.471
[doorbell rings]

14:23.514 --> 14:27.562
Thisis where Felix grew up?

14:28.563 --> 14:30.086
Hi.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.177
W-What are you doing here?

14:34.221 --> 14:37.224
We came to see how you're doing.

14:38.747 --> 14:41.706
Really? Why?

14:41.750 --> 14:45.623
Because we're your friends. Duh.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.713
Oh.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.025
Yeah, we, uh,
we didn't finish them all,

14:56.069 --> 14:59.289
so we thought
you might be hungry.[clears throat]

14:59.333 --> 15:04.904
Okay, well, thank you for
the horrible-looking chicken.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.601
KATHY:
Felix?

15:06.644 --> 15:08.342
Oh, and it's
my mother. Perfect.Who's there?

15:08.385 --> 15:09.647
Oh, Mrs. Felix.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.520
Hi. We're from Felix's work.Hi.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.478
You must be Murphy.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.089
It's so good

15:16.132 --> 15:17.351
to finally meet you.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.961
And that would make you Jess.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.267
Yes.
I'm Kathy.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.529
Hi.
You know who we are?

15:21.572 --> 15:23.574
Sassy Murphy
and her bestie Jess.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.489
[laughter]Sounds about right.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.970
It's about time Felix's friends
came around.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.146
You know, we were beginning
to think you didn't exist.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.452
Oh.
Oh.
You know, that
would be like

15:31.495 --> 15:33.062
ninth grade all
over again, huh?

15:33.106 --> 15:35.978
Okay. I think they have to go.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.546
No, no, no. We, uh... Not at
all. We're here for you, Fee.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.983
We-we wanted
to come by and just

15:41.027 --> 15:42.550
see how Uncle
Randy was doing...

15:42.593 --> 15:44.552
Ralph.Uncle Ra-- Ralph was doing.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.902
Yeah.
You two are so sweet.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.599
You know, with my
son and daughter

15:48.643 --> 15:50.558
out of town,
we could use the company.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.603
Well, your other son's
standing right next to you,

15:52.647 --> 15:55.432
but whatever, and no,
they don't want to stay.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.912
We'd love to stay.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.392
Thanks, Kath, you're a peach.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.437
Wonderful. Let me
show you around.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.831
Excellent. Come on. Thank you.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.398
Okay.Come on, Pretzel.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.616
Smells nice.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.536
There's no blood?
Noth-- are you sure?

16:12.580 --> 16:14.408
No. No blood.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.888
[groans]

16:16.932 --> 16:19.239
I didn't realize Felix was rich.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.588
Like, how rich?

16:20.631 --> 16:25.636
Rich. Like,
really rich.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.899
You know, he literally made me
pay him back six bucks

16:27.943 --> 16:29.423
for my ham sandwich yesterday?

16:29.466 --> 16:31.903
Look at this.
Oh, my God. I broke-- ooh.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.079
He's the actual worst.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.168
Like, this could go everywhere.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.955
God, why isn't
his uncle dead yet?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.217
[quietly]: It's Felix,
Felix, Felix.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.479
Hey. Hey, Felix.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.525
Hey.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.657
Just so you know, I don't talk
about you guys that much.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.485
Kathy likes to exaggerate.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.488
Hey, Richie Rich,
I want my six bucks back.I'm not rich.

16:51.532 --> 16:54.056
My parents are, and I refuse
to take a dime from them.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.102
I'll take their dimes.Hey, so, uh,

16:56.145 --> 16:58.756
just want to say, it's super
weird that you're here.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.976
Yeah, I know. Uh, we, uh...

17:01.020 --> 17:03.152
I mean, it was all Jess. She
wouldn't shut up about how sad

17:03.196 --> 17:05.198
you looked at work, and
I naturally made fun of you,

17:05.241 --> 17:07.069
which was rude, and she
was like, "You know,

17:07.113 --> 17:09.028
you shouldn't be a dick,
we should be there for him."

17:09.071 --> 17:11.160
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.554
Wow. I guess
it's times like these

17:13.597 --> 17:15.643
you find out
who really cares about you.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.863
KATHY:
Felix,

17:18.907 --> 17:20.561
it's time.

17:20.604 --> 17:21.997
[sighs]

17:22.041 --> 17:23.999
It's time.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.262
[phone buzzes]

17:28.612 --> 17:31.093
MAX:
Murph, what is going on?

17:31.137 --> 17:33.400
You've been ignoring me all day.

17:33.443 --> 17:35.576
Just call me, okay?

17:35.619 --> 17:37.839
Please.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.362
[sighs]

17:39.406 --> 17:40.885
Who was that?

17:40.929 --> 17:42.670
No one.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.672
I thought you said it was over
between you and Murphy.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.500
And you said that I wouldn't
have anything to do

17:46.543 --> 17:47.892
besides clean some money.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.590
What the hell are we doing,
all right?

17:49.633 --> 17:51.026
This isn't what I signed up for.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.462
We'll be done in a bit,

17:52.506 --> 17:54.247
but you're done with Murphy
starting now.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.031
That's not up to you, man.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.164
Now, why are we using this

17:58.207 --> 17:59.295
nervous white boy's
truck anyway?

17:59.339 --> 18:00.601
Come on, Wesley.

18:00.644 --> 18:01.993
Who you think the cops
are gonna stop?

18:02.037 --> 18:04.692
My ride or this weird-ass truck?
Use your brain.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.302
Where we dropping this stuff?There's an old spot

18:06.346 --> 18:09.000
we used to use over off Grand.WESLEY:
W-Wait a minute.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.002
Why can't we just use your crib
so we know it won't get jacked?

18:11.046 --> 18:12.134
'Cause I'm not stupid enough

18:12.178 --> 18:14.005
to have a bunch of product
on me, Wesley.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.746
Man, I can see why Nia thinks
you're such a little bitch.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.360
Move.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.975
[monitor beeping steadily]

18:31.849 --> 18:33.851
His heartbeat's fading.

18:35.549 --> 18:39.379
It's okay, Ralphy,
you can let go.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.424
[beeping rapidly]

18:43.078 --> 18:45.211
Oh, my God, I think this is it.
It's happening.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.518
[sniffles]

18:48.562 --> 18:50.781
Good-bye, Uncle Ralph.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.609
[gasps]

18:52.653 --> 18:54.133
What?I don't know.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.308
[wheezes]

18:55.351 --> 18:58.398
What was that?

18:58.441 --> 18:59.747
I don't know.What the hell was that?

18:59.790 --> 19:00.791
I don't know.What happened?

19:03.620 --> 19:05.187
[clears throat]

19:05.231 --> 19:08.625
Oh, Felix, hey.Hey.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.759
Felix, I'm so sorry. Is he gone?

19:11.802 --> 19:13.413
Oh, he got a second wind.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.284
The nurse thinks he's gonna
make it till tomorrow.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.590
Oh, my God, that's great.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.069
Yeah.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.550
Thank the good Lord.

19:20.594 --> 19:21.899
Yeah.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.734
Okay, we need to leave soon

19:30.778 --> 19:33.041
because we can't
stay here all night.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.999
Oh, come on.

19:35.043 --> 19:37.959
I bet the thread count on
the sheets is off the chain.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.527
[phone vibrates]

19:40.570 --> 19:44.574
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Text from Max.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.228
Okay, do you know
how much it sucks

19:46.272 --> 19:47.447
when the person you're dating
ignores you?

19:51.320 --> 19:52.582
Hi, Kathy.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.803
Hello, Jess.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.587
I love it here.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.806
KATHY:
You know,

19:58.849 --> 20:00.416
while Felix is still upstairs,

20:00.460 --> 20:03.245
may I say,
it's so nice of you two to come.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.247
Aw.
Aw.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.422
Are we, like, the first girls

20:06.466 --> 20:08.119
that Felix has ever
brought home?

20:08.163 --> 20:10.383
No, girls were
his brother's domain.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.254
Felix wasn't good at much.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.429
Hmm.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.651
FELIX: Hey.Mm. Fee, your sister sent over

20:17.694 --> 20:19.218
some chocolates,
isn't that nice?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.742
Go ahead, read the card.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.268
"Good-bye, Uncle Ralph.

20:26.312 --> 20:29.706
Sad face. Love, Lesley."

20:29.750 --> 20:31.273
How touching.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.275
What do you expect her
to write, an essay?

20:33.319 --> 20:34.842
She's on partner track,
it's very demanding.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.887
You know, actually,
Felix works really hard, too.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.889
Jess, don't.Yes, yes, I know.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.283
He's always telling me how busy
it is over at the pet store.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.285
It's actually not a pet store.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.504
It's a major nonprofit
that provides

20:44.547 --> 20:45.853
service animals to over

20:45.896 --> 20:47.724
500 people every year,
myself included.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.073
Hmm.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.649
Jules. Ooh,
what's with the face?

20:59.693 --> 21:01.085
Oh... [stammers]
Family thing.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.349
[chuckles]

21:03.392 --> 21:04.959
Where is everybody?

21:05.002 --> 21:07.962
They are on their way to raid
the trap house on Carver.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.312
Carver?

21:10.356 --> 21:12.140
I thought they were waiting
till after midnight.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.055
They got a call that it was
being cleaned out early.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.317
Took the TAC team
and everything.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.146
TAC team? That's aggressive.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.322
Could get ugly.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.845
Okay. I got to run.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.847
Uh, have a good night.
Don't stay too late.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.372
Yeah.

21:39.254 --> 21:41.038
Damn it.

21:44.128 --> 21:47.088
[pop song playing]

21:47.131 --> 21:49.220
Hey.
Hey. Murphy's not here.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.135
Actually, I, uh,
came here to see you.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.486
Really?
Yeah.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.923
Uh...

21:55.966 --> 21:58.404
You want to hang out
sometime? With me?

22:00.231 --> 22:02.973
Like, uh...

22:03.017 --> 22:06.934
I'm-I'm sorry, Officer,
are you trying to ask me out?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.849
Yes. Sorry.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.895
It's my first time doing this
since my wife died.

22:11.939 --> 22:15.029
Okay, I'm gonna
stop talking now.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.510
I get off in an hour.

22:17.553 --> 22:21.252
Okay.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.343
Cool.
Cool.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.868
[laughs]
See you later.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.435
MURPHY:
You know, I'm sort of digging

22:29.478 --> 22:31.480
this whole bitter thing
you got going with your mom.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.090
Gives you an edge.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.963
I'm so nice to her, and
she treats me like garbage.

22:36.006 --> 22:39.880
Then she bronzes my brother
and sister's turds.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.882
Oh, I know why
you're nice to her.

22:41.925 --> 22:44.319
Yeah. My therapist says
it's because I'm desperate

22:44.363 --> 22:45.886
for the attention
of strong female figures

22:45.929 --> 22:47.975
I never got as a child.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.760
Oh, I was gonna say it's
because you love her, but...

22:50.804 --> 22:53.937
It's just...

22:53.981 --> 22:56.244
my mom was never much of a mom.

22:56.287 --> 22:59.247
My dad was always off working.
Our nannies...

22:59.290 --> 23:01.380
Nannies, plural?

23:01.423 --> 23:03.382
Wow. Continue.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.342
My nannies-- I don't know--
were just...

23:07.386 --> 23:09.823
I always felt like
I was their job,

23:09.866 --> 23:11.868
and I was. [chuckles]

23:11.912 --> 23:13.870
Uncle Ralph's, like,
the only person in my family

23:13.914 --> 23:16.003
who I've thought
really cared about me.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.440
Aw, Felix.
FELIX:
It's super sad, right?

23:18.484 --> 23:21.138
Yeah.
Dude, you're, like,
the saddest,

23:21.182 --> 23:23.140
richest kid in
all of Chicago.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.583
We're empty.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.411
[chuckles][bottle clatters]

23:32.454 --> 23:34.978
Let's open up a Rothschild
and really piss Kathy off.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.676
[laughter]

23:36.719 --> 23:40.375
I love that that's
your idea of rebellion.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.594
The Bordeaux glasses
are upstairs.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.422
I'll be right back.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.860
Ow.

23:46.903 --> 23:49.340
Murphy, this has gone way past
the point of a casual visit.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.472
[snores]

23:50.516 --> 23:53.649
I feel so bad. This is so wrong.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.172
Maybe it's because I'm drunk,

23:55.216 --> 23:57.610
but I'm actually not hating
his company for once.

23:57.653 --> 23:58.872
Yeah, here's a crazy thought,

23:58.915 --> 24:00.700
maybe you shouldn't
be drinking right now.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.919
Oh, would you stop it?Murphy, wha...

24:02.963 --> 24:04.704
Come on, let's go.
No!

24:04.747 --> 24:07.010
Why?
Because when am I
gonna get the chance

24:07.054 --> 24:08.272
to feel another dead body?

24:08.316 --> 24:11.450
JESS: Are you listening
to the words...

24:11.493 --> 24:13.495
[Felix sighs]

24:13.539 --> 24:15.584
The reason you're here

24:15.628 --> 24:17.499
is because you want

24:17.543 --> 24:20.459
to feel a dead body?

24:22.286 --> 24:23.549
Oh, God.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.898
Just get out of my house.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.203
Hang on. Felix...

24:26.247 --> 24:28.075
Leave! Now!

24:40.348 --> 24:42.959
Well, this sucks.

24:43.003 --> 24:47.529
You are so focused on being
a good friend to Tyson

24:47.573 --> 24:49.009
that you are
completely oblivious

24:49.052 --> 24:52.142
how awful you are being
to everyone else.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.188
Okay, Jess. Cool. [laughs]

24:54.231 --> 24:57.757
Yeah, but, "Cool, cool, Jess,"
that's all you ever have to say.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.149
Calling an Uber.

24:59.193 --> 25:01.543
AUTOMATED VOICE: Calling Uber.I am not like you!

25:01.587 --> 25:03.545
I can't...

25:03.589 --> 25:06.983
I can't go and-and feel
a dead body like it's nothing,

25:07.027 --> 25:10.204
and I can't hurt someone
like it's nothing,

25:10.247 --> 25:13.424
and I most certainly can't
just ignore my boyfriend

25:13.468 --> 25:16.297
when I might be-be
carrying his baby.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.910
I'm gonna go apologize to Felix.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.870
And, no, I'm not ignoring Max

25:23.913 --> 25:25.698
or the fact that
I might be carrying

25:25.741 --> 25:28.048
some stupid baby
inside of me.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.616
That's actually all I've been
thinking about all day.

25:30.659 --> 25:34.271
'Cause you know what?
I cannot even imagine the idea

25:34.315 --> 25:38.580
of passing on these messed-up
genes to anyone else!

25:38.624 --> 25:41.017
Murphy, your genes
aren't messed up.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.542
I wasn't talking
about being blind.

25:44.978 --> 25:47.284
[sniffles]
[sighs]

25:49.156 --> 25:51.550
What?

25:51.593 --> 25:53.682
Sorry that I'm
such a dick, Felix.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.382
Is everyone happy?

25:58.426 --> 26:00.167
â™ª I came home... Come on.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.299
â™ª In the middle of the night

26:04.867 --> 26:06.521
â™ª My father says

26:06.565 --> 26:11.570
â™ª "What you gonna do
with your life?" â™ª

26:11.613 --> 26:14.485
â™ª Well, daddy dear

26:14.529 --> 26:16.575
â™ª You're still number one...

26:16.618 --> 26:18.446
Please work.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.621
â™ª Oh, girls

26:19.665 --> 26:22.624
â™ª They want to have fun...

26:22.668 --> 26:26.019
[line ringing]

26:26.062 --> 26:29.457
Do not screen me right now.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.679
â™ª The phone rings

26:33.722 --> 26:37.508
â™ª In the middle of the night

26:37.552 --> 26:39.641
â™ª My mother says...

26:39.685 --> 26:41.425
Call Max.

26:41.469 --> 26:42.644
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Calling Max.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.516
[cell phone buzzing]

26:45.560 --> 26:47.997
â™ª Well, mother dear

26:48.041 --> 26:50.957
â™ª We're not the
fortunate ones... â™ª

26:51.000 --> 26:52.785
There you are.MURPHY: Hey.

26:52.828 --> 26:53.786
Is everything okay?

26:53.829 --> 26:56.440
Yeah. Um...

26:56.484 --> 26:58.007
Do you want to come over?

26:58.051 --> 27:00.967
Yeah, I can, uh,
I can be there in an hour.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.795
Great.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.448
Hey, you-you sure you're okay?

27:04.492 --> 27:06.059
Where have you been all day?

27:06.102 --> 27:08.278
Yeah, I was-- I'm fine.
I was trying to find

27:08.322 --> 27:10.411
the flower shop Tyson worked at.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.891
Did you find it?

27:11.934 --> 27:13.414
Yeah. He did deliveries
for this place

27:13.457 --> 27:16.896
called Clover Flora
or something.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.158
Really?

27:18.201 --> 27:19.681
Yeah, you know it?

27:19.725 --> 27:21.291
I, uh, yeah,
I-I know a guy

27:21.335 --> 27:23.380
that buys his Molly
from Clover Flora.

27:23.424 --> 27:24.773
I'm pretty sure
it's a front.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.775
Wait, wait, wait. That, um...

27:26.819 --> 27:28.908
You think that place
is a drug front?

27:28.951 --> 27:30.692
Pretty sure.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.999
Okay, Max, I got to go. Sorry.

27:34.696 --> 27:37.307
Murph...

27:37.351 --> 27:40.310
Okay.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.573
We got to bounce, now.

27:42.617 --> 27:43.749
Hey, hold up, man, we still got
half our stash left.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.925
Cops are gonna be here
any minute.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.796
We can take them.
All right, we're armed.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.016
Man, we can't leave
all that product.What? No.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.887
No, we can't take them,
Wesley, all right?

27:51.931 --> 27:53.149
I'm not dying here tonight.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.629
Don't be such a bitch, man.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.109
You think you're a hot shot?
You ain't nothing

27:56.152 --> 27:57.937
but a small-time runner
who had a good couple of weeks.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.721
And you're just an old man
who can't keep up.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.767
I get it. You're Nia's little
lapdog, but I run things.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.072
Max, drive.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.910
[sirens wailing]

28:27.531 --> 28:29.925
Felix.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.797
I'm so sorry.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.582
Apology accepted. You can leave.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.977
I don't feel like you actually
accepted my apology.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.587
Honestly, you're pretty low

28:39.630 --> 28:41.720
on the list of things
upsetting me right now, okay?

28:41.763 --> 28:42.851
[knife clatters]Great, now my knife is dirty.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.897
I'll...
No, I got it.

28:46.202 --> 28:49.336
Okay. Okay, it's okay.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.817
[groans] Everything
is falling apart.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.950
I'm gonna make this for you.No, I'm fine. I got it, okay?

28:54.994 --> 28:56.735
Felix?
What?

28:56.778 --> 28:59.563
You are sad,
and that's okay,

28:59.607 --> 29:01.870
but I'm-I'm gonna
make you food

29:01.914 --> 29:05.395
because that's-that's
what I do.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.049
Okay?

29:11.488 --> 29:14.143
Okay. No cheese, though,
'cause I have a lactose thing.

29:14.187 --> 29:17.843
Oh, okay.And easy on the lettuce.

29:17.886 --> 29:18.974
I'm allergic

29:19.018 --> 29:21.847
to mayo, so...
Just...

29:26.329 --> 29:27.809
Thank you.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.855
[sniffles]

29:29.898 --> 29:31.900
Come here. Come here.

29:37.645 --> 29:40.039
You're gonna be okay.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.309
That can't
happen again.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.224
I don't want you using
my truck for this.

29:51.267 --> 29:52.878
Who do you think pays
for this thing?

29:52.921 --> 29:54.880
I clean your money.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.925
That doesn't mean you own
my time or my truck

29:56.969 --> 29:58.666
or anything else about my life.

29:58.709 --> 30:03.323
I'm sorry you got it bad
for Murphy, but it's over.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.064
I'm not playing.

30:05.107 --> 30:07.109
There are people above me
calling the shots.

30:07.153 --> 30:08.415
You need to walk away.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.634
I can't do that.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.854
And if you were
in my position,

30:12.898 --> 30:14.900
you'd say the same thing.

30:22.516 --> 30:26.302
As far as I know,
you guys don't talk. We clear?

30:26.346 --> 30:27.869
Done.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.100
[door bells jingle]

30:43.319 --> 30:45.060
Hey, man.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.889
What up?
Talk to your people?

30:47.933 --> 30:49.369
Yeah,
they're-they're good.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.023
Oh, really?

30:51.066 --> 30:54.113
Yeah. Darnell said I could work
for you on the side, no problem.

30:54.156 --> 30:56.028
No problem?
Yeah.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.074
We're operating on
different territory.

30:59.118 --> 31:01.120
It's a different
business.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.430
All right.
Welcome aboard.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.783
Hello?
Oh, you.

31:12.827 --> 31:15.569
We're closing.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.963
Sell any drugs today?

31:18.006 --> 31:19.965
I don't know what you're
talking about, lady.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.444
This is a flower shop.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.883
So, look, I know

31:24.926 --> 31:27.494
this is a front, and I also know
that Tyson used to sell

31:27.537 --> 31:28.974
drugs for you. Okay?

31:29.017 --> 31:32.455
So what I want is for you
to tell me exactly...

31:35.719 --> 31:38.897
Oh, thank God. [laughs]

31:40.159 --> 31:42.639
Can I use your bathroom, please?

31:42.683 --> 31:44.728
No. Employees only.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.469
Okay, well,
I just started my period.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.081
My beautiful, beautiful--
thank God--

31:49.124 --> 31:50.691
sweet, beautiful period.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.260
So if you don't want
blood on your floor...

31:54.303 --> 31:55.478
Open camera.

31:58.264 --> 32:01.223
Send to Jess.

32:01.267 --> 32:05.053
AUTOMATED VOICE:
New text from Jess.
"Congratulations."

32:08.013 --> 32:12.191
Uh, reply:
"I'm sorry about today.

32:12.234 --> 32:15.107
I love you more than the baby
I almost had."

32:15.150 --> 32:17.109
Send.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.110
[phone chimes]

32:18.153 --> 32:20.112
New text from Jess.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.201
"I love you, too, idiot."

32:25.987 --> 32:29.164
Hell yeah.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.340
You know, I honestly
don't know what we did

32:31.384 --> 32:32.863
to deserve this break, Pretzel,

32:32.907 --> 32:35.605
but you're gonna
remain an only child.

32:35.649 --> 32:39.609
And I am going
to look into an IUD,

32:39.653 --> 32:43.309
because we are never
doing this again.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.354
EVAN:
Whoa, whoa, what the hell?

32:45.398 --> 32:47.313
MAN:
You stole our spot,
now give me your stash!

32:47.356 --> 32:49.141
EVAN:
No! Get off![rustling, clattering]

32:49.184 --> 32:51.056
Don't smash the-- hey![crashing]

32:52.666 --> 32:54.798
MAN:
I said give me your stash, now!

32:54.842 --> 32:56.583
[gunshots]

32:56.626 --> 32:59.107
[thudding,
broken glass tinkling]

33:01.066 --> 33:03.068
[exhales]

33:07.115 --> 33:08.203
[Pretzel whines quietly]

33:08.247 --> 33:09.683
[whispering]:
Come on, boy. Come on.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.207
Come on, come on.

33:14.122 --> 33:16.124
[approaching footsteps]Pretzel.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.039
Pretzel, come on. Up, up.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.084
Pretzel wants up?

33:22.696 --> 33:24.089
Shh.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.357
[floor creaking]

33:39.191 --> 33:41.193
[floor creaking]

33:45.414 --> 33:48.722
[voices, footsteps receding]

33:48.765 --> 33:51.246
[door bells jingle]

34:00.212 --> 34:03.171
[panting]

34:09.090 --> 34:11.049
Hello?

34:12.311 --> 34:15.009
Hello?

34:15.053 --> 34:18.099
Find outside, Pretzel.
Find outside.

34:18.143 --> 34:19.622
[whimpers]

34:19.666 --> 34:21.233
Pretzel, go forward.
Forward, Pretzel.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.192
Forward, Pretzel.

34:24.236 --> 34:26.064
Go, Pretzel, forward.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.937
Hello?

34:38.206 --> 34:40.121
Hello?

34:42.602 --> 34:45.039
[whispers]:
Is anyone there?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.085
Hello?[thuds softly]

35:08.106 --> 35:10.891
[quietly]:
You okay?

35:10.934 --> 35:12.936
Hello?
[sniffles]

35:25.775 --> 35:27.429
Call 911.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.692
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Calling 911.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.433
[line ringing]

35:31.477 --> 35:33.783
DISPATCHER:
911, please hold.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.046
Hold?

35:39.354 --> 35:42.923
When I met you, I thought
you were crushing on Murphy.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.446
No.
[laughs]

35:44.490 --> 35:46.796
Murphy and I are friends.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.106
You're not, like,
secretly married, right?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.499
Not that I'm aware of, no.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.718
Are you addicted
to weird porn?

35:55.762 --> 35:57.372
Uh...Are you a serial killer?

35:57.416 --> 35:59.374
I mean, you can--
I can take it, come on.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.594
What's wrong with you?

36:01.637 --> 36:03.161
You know, I, uh...

36:03.204 --> 36:05.250
[quietly]:
I don't floss.

36:05.293 --> 36:10.080
And I, uh, I lie to my
dentist when she asks, so...

36:11.081 --> 36:13.040
You're disgusting. I want out.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.085
[both laugh]

36:15.129 --> 36:17.349
What are you doing?

36:17.392 --> 36:20.090
I don't know.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.493
[phone buzzing]

36:34.061 --> 36:37.020
[sighs]

36:37.064 --> 36:38.239
[stifled laugh]

36:38.283 --> 36:39.806
I do not need to answer this.

36:39.849 --> 36:41.416
It's fine. You guys are friends.

36:41.460 --> 36:45.377
Just... see what she wants.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.292
Hello, Murphy.
What's happening?

36:47.335 --> 36:48.597
Dean, I think someone got shot.

36:48.641 --> 36:51.121
What? Where are you?

36:51.165 --> 36:54.951
At some flower shop.
It's called Clover Flora.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.431
Is he still breathing?

36:56.475 --> 36:59.173
I can't tell
if he's breathing, I...

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
I just felt all this blood,
I don't-I don't...

37:01.262 --> 37:02.698
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.004
It's gonna be fine.

37:04.047 --> 37:05.658
Try not to panic,
but you need t-to see

37:05.701 --> 37:06.920
if he's still breathing.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.226
Uh, feel for a pulse.

37:16.451 --> 37:19.498
He's dead.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.500
He's definitely,
definitely dead.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.893
All right, look, I'm on my way.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.857
â™ª

37:32.859 --> 37:34.817
I'm sorry, I...
No, no.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.124
It sounds like
you've got to go.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.561
Sorry.

37:39.605 --> 37:44.087
â™ª I'm lonely too...

37:44.131 --> 37:46.176
[door opens]

37:48.875 --> 37:52.139
â™ª What's that song...

37:52.182 --> 37:54.881
Thank you.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.187
Come on, Jules.

37:57.231 --> 38:00.582
You know I didn't plan that.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.150
I know you're a criminal,
and I know I helped you.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.978
I didn't ask you to do that.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.459
What was my alternative,
hear you died in a shootout?

38:07.502 --> 38:08.938
I can take care of myself.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.289
You put me
in an impossible position.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.639
And what
really scares me

38:13.682 --> 38:15.510
is I didn't even hesitate.

38:15.554 --> 38:16.772
You think

38:16.816 --> 38:18.121
this doesn't scare me, too?

38:18.165 --> 38:19.558
Do you know
what would happen to me

38:19.601 --> 38:21.211
if Nia found out
I was in with a cop?

38:22.691 --> 38:24.911
I wish I didn't love you.

38:24.954 --> 38:28.175
But I do,
and I have since I was 14.

38:28.218 --> 38:31.787
â™ª You're not alone...

38:31.831 --> 38:34.137
[sighs]

38:35.617 --> 38:37.489
So here we are.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.882
â™ª Every tear...

38:39.926 --> 38:42.189
Here we are.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.020
I picked up
that lasagna bolognese.

38:48.543 --> 38:51.241
â™ª Tastes the same...

38:51.285 --> 38:52.330
[laughs softly]

38:58.379 --> 39:00.599
â™ª A broken dream

39:02.209 --> 39:03.341
â™ª A broken heart

39:05.604 --> 39:07.823
â™ª Isolated

39:07.867 --> 39:10.260
â™ª And afraid

39:10.304 --> 39:13.829
â™ª Open up, this is a raid...

39:13.873 --> 39:15.831
So...

39:15.875 --> 39:17.311
Get some rest.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.922
We can deal with everything else
in the morning.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.228
â™ª You're not alone...

39:21.271 --> 39:22.490
Okay.

39:24.492 --> 39:26.842
â™ª An open hand

39:26.886 --> 39:29.323
â™ª An open heart

39:29.367 --> 39:31.107
[elevator bell dings]

39:31.151 --> 39:33.632
â™ª There's no need

39:33.675 --> 39:37.157
â™ª To be afraid

39:37.200 --> 39:38.201
â™ª Open up, this is...

39:38.245 --> 39:40.378
Murphy, what the hell?

39:40.421 --> 39:43.337
It's okay. I'm okay.

39:44.425 --> 39:48.168
â™ª You're not alone...

39:48.211 --> 39:50.170
I'm gonna head out. Uh...

39:51.432 --> 39:52.607
Thanks for bringing her home.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.609
â™ª Through to you...

39:54.653 --> 39:56.219
Thank you.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.395
Of course.

40:03.052 --> 40:07.230
â™ª I'm gonna get it
through to you â™ª

40:07.274 --> 40:10.451
â™ª You're not alone.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.497
Here's more tea.

40:14.499 --> 40:17.850
I'm telling you, this guy
felt different than Tyson.

40:20.374 --> 40:24.378
I knew he was dead
the moment I felt him.

40:24.422 --> 40:29.122
His face was, like, tense

40:29.165 --> 40:31.429
and colder.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.431
A lot colder.

40:33.474 --> 40:36.434
And Tyson was outside
in the freezing weather.

40:36.477 --> 40:39.437
So you're saying...?

40:39.480 --> 40:41.439
[exhales]

40:41.482 --> 40:45.443
I think he was alive
in the alley and then ran away.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.923
Whoa.

40:47.967 --> 40:50.839
I mean, it makes sense why they
didn't find his body, you know?

40:50.883 --> 40:52.841
[insects chirping]

40:59.587 --> 41:02.590
And wherever he is, he doesn't
want to be found, but...

41:09.597 --> 41:13.209
I think,
I think maybe he's okay.

41:13.253 --> 41:15.560
What do you think's
inside here, man?

41:15.603 --> 41:18.214
I don't know, man,
but this is heavy.
