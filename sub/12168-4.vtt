00:07.800 --> 00:10.640
Alright, I'm about ready to call this one.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.960
Doesn't look like there are any survivors.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.840
The cullings are getting more and more intense.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.600
<i>Well, you said it yourself:</i>

00:17.880 --> 00:19.880
too many Wraith woke up at the same time.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.160
Too many mouths to feed or...

00:22.200 --> 00:23.600
hands to feed.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.800
Well, we're headin' back
to the Gate, meet you there?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.480
<i>Sounds like a plan.
McKay, Beckett you havin' any luck?</i>

00:29.520 --> 00:31.200
Negative, Colonel, we haven't found anyone.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.960
<i>Make your way back to the Gate.</i>

00:33.040 --> 00:34.840
<i>Will do. Beckett out.</i>

00:37.200 --> 00:38.000
So...

00:38.720 --> 00:42.480
maybe you should pick some wildflowers from
around here I think she'd get a kick out of that.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.560
What are you talking about?

00:43.600 --> 00:47.200
You've got a date tomorrow tonight
with Katie Brown, right? She's a botanist

00:47.240 --> 00:48.560
she never gets to go offworld, so...

00:48.600 --> 00:50.840
- What's this now?!
- It's nothing, nothing.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.560
You have a date, Rodney?

00:52.600 --> 00:53.520
With a woman?

00:53.560 --> 00:56.360
It is simply two adults sharing some friendly...

00:56.400 --> 00:58.160
Yes, with a woman!

00:59.320 --> 01:01.520
Well, she's excited about it.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.880
- Not sure why, though.
- How would you know?

01:03.920 --> 01:06.520
Girls' poker night.
I know a lot of things, McKay.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.840
I'm sure it's none of your business.
This is an inappropriate field conversation.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.880
What? I was just suggesting
you might wanna pick some flowers...

01:10.920 --> 01:12.880
Yes, and maybe you should just do
your job, which is to protect us.

01:12.920 --> 01:13.960
Shut up.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.040
Shut up?  Let me tell you something...

01:15.080 --> 01:17.200
Stop speaking!

01:19.920 --> 01:20.960
Dart.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.240
<i>We have a Dart incoming.</i>

01:25.560 --> 01:26.600
Move it!

01:29.160 --> 01:31.200
Seeing us will blow Atlantis' cover.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.040
<i>Anyone get
a clear shot, you take it, understand?</i>

01:37.560 --> 01:39.000
Scatter!

01:39.560 --> 01:40.680
McKay!

02:10.520 --> 02:13.720
It is heading towards the Gate.
We damaged it but it is still on its way.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.280
Wait! McKay and Cadman
have been beamed aboard that Dart!

02:16.320 --> 02:19.480
We can't risk the Dart
making it back to the hive ship.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.520
Oh, crap!

04:26.640 --> 04:29.000
I'm a doctor.
I can help.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.480
What the hell d'you think you're doing?

04:37.520 --> 04:39.640
It was reaching for the self-destruct.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.800
He's the only one that can get Cadman and McKay out!

04:41.840 --> 04:44.640
I seriously doubt he'd oblige.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.960
<i>Well, we'll never know now, will we?</i>

04:47.440 --> 04:48.680
Is everyone alright?

04:48.720 --> 04:51.120
We're fine. Hanson, radio Atlantis.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.360
We want Zelenka here asap. We've got a problem.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.320
<i>Colonel!</i>

05:22.560 --> 05:24.080
First time offworld?

05:24.120 --> 05:24.880
Yes!

05:26.080 --> 05:29.120
Well, if there were any more Wraith,
they would have attacked us by now.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.040
Really?

05:30.280 --> 05:33.120
If it makes you feel better.
Did you find what we want?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.880
Well, yes, but it's very complex.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.960
This interface controls the machine

05:38.000 --> 05:39.560
that dematerialises people,

05:39.600 --> 05:43.200
stores their information and then
rematerialises them again when commanded to.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.280
Great.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.280
Command it to!

05:46.320 --> 05:47.120
I can't.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.120
From what we can tell,
the materialiser is storing two lifesigns.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.360
- Yes.
- Which is good!

05:51.400 --> 05:56.400
Yes, but there is only enough power in the Dart's
energy cell to successfully rematerialise one of them.

05:56.440 --> 06:00.920
Power to the rematerialiser has been
completely severed and emergency back-up
power has been completely run down.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.080
OK.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.680
You have to decide which one we're going to beam out.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.360
It's a terrible choice to have to make.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.200
It's easy.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.720
Beam out McKay he'll figure
it out how to get Cadman free.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.600
No, no, no, sorry I was unclear.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.320
There's no way of telling which is which.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.920
Yes. They just read as lifesigns.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.760
Perfect.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.680
Alright...

06:19.800 --> 06:22.680
... that one.
Go. Stand aside.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.520
Rodney, you OK?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.840
His pulse is stable but
I need to get him back to Atlantis.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.400
Teyla, Lorne, help the Doc
head back to the city with McKay.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.440
We're gonna stay here with Zelenka
try to bring as much of the Dart back as possible.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.560
All of his vitals are stable.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.080
His body's reacting like it's been
struck by a Wraith stunner.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.120
So you think once the initial shock is over,
we'll have the old McKay back?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.080
I'm afraid so!

07:04.080 --> 07:06.080
Have they had any luck with the wreckage?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.280
No.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.200
Lieutenant Cadman is still in there somewhere.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.640
- Did you know her well?
-  No, not really.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.560
She was with the new batch
that came aboard the Daedalus.

07:16.565 --> 07:18.365
She seemed quite lovely, though.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.520
She saved my life.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.960
Well, you'll be the first person
I call when we find her.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.480
Thank you.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.320
<i>"That reminds me of my nephew's birth!"</i>

07:36.240 --> 07:37.520
How's it coming?

07:37.560 --> 07:40.600
Well, the good news is we were able
to stabilise the lifesigns signature.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.960
Now it's just a question of getting
the machine online again.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.400
Great. How do we power it up?

07:44.440 --> 07:45.640
Well, that's the bad news.

07:45.680 --> 07:52.640
The machine uses a very specialised
transformer to convert raw power
into highly stable, very specific stream of power.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.880
Now the transformer's
crucial in operating the machine safely and...

07:55.920 --> 07:57.720
... it's been damaged.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.120
Don't suppose there are any spares in the trunk?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.680
We're working on reverse engineering one.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.240
Good.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.560
Let me know the second you have something.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.720
<i>"Well, OK then, come on kids, go go go."</i>

08:10.760 --> 08:13.600
<i>"We have to finish this one!
Let's get going! Hurry!"</i>

08:30.080 --> 08:31.680
Not bad, uh?

08:32.760 --> 08:33.760
It's fine.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.679
So what do you think of Atlantis?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.640
It's fine.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.960
Have you thought about what
you wanna do after you're done here?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.320
Do you want me to leave?

08:50.040 --> 08:53.600
No! No! Stay as long as you like. I'm just saying,

08:54.200 --> 08:56.040
you know your way around,

08:56.080 --> 08:59.080
you can take care of yourself in a fight...

08:59.085 --> 09:02.365
Yeah! You hate the Wraith as much as we do...

09:03.600 --> 09:05.960
OK, maybe more than we do.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.920
But the point is...

09:08.240 --> 09:14.360
we could use a guy like you around here
and you look like you could use a place to stay.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.520
I'm not sure I'd fit in here.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.360
There's only one way to find out.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.280
Do I have to decide now, or can I finish eating?

09:31.720 --> 09:33.360
Take your time.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.400
And...

09:38.360 --> 09:39.640
try these...

09:39.760 --> 09:41.160
they work great!

09:56.240 --> 09:57.440
Hello.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.720
How're you feeling, Rodney?

10:05.040 --> 10:08.240
Um, terrible.  What happened?

10:08.640 --> 10:10.240
You were scooped up by a Dart.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.720
Oh, great!

10:11.760 --> 10:13.280
How'd I get out?

10:13.320 --> 10:15.560
It's a long story,
but I'm glad to see you're doing well.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.040
Hello?  Doctor Beckett.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.360
Is that Cadman?

10:19.400 --> 10:20.800
Doctor McKay.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.520
Where is she?

10:23.600 --> 10:24.560
I'm right here.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.760
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.000
What?!

10:28.600 --> 10:29.880
Who said that?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.920
I did.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.000
You said "What?!"?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.360
I said Lieutenant Cadman
is still trapped inside the Dart.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.440
No, no, no, did you just say the word, "What?"?

10:36.480 --> 10:37.000
No, I didn't.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.560
McKay!

10:38.600 --> 10:40.320
- Yes, where are you?
- I'm right here.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.320
No, no, I'm talking to Cadman, shut up for a second.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.240
- She's not here, Rodney.
- Yes I am!

10:44.280 --> 10:46.520
You didn't just hear that,
you didn't just hear Lieutenant Cadman.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.800
No, I didn't.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.360
Headset.

10:51.760 --> 10:52.760
I'm not wearing a headset!

10:52.800 --> 10:54.240
McKay, where are you?

10:54.280 --> 10:55.760
I'm right in front of Carson.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.040
Oh no.

10:57.045 --> 10:59.325
Put your hands over your eyes.

10:59.360 --> 10:59.760
Why?

10:59.800 --> 11:00.640
Just do it!

11:00.680 --> 11:05.280
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.
I think maybe you're experiencing some sort of ...
Rodney, what are you doing?

11:05.320 --> 11:07.000
Oh, this is terrible.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.880
- What's terrible?
- I can see that!

11:08.920 --> 11:12.520
I can see your hands over
your eyes as if they were my eyes.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.560
Carson, hi

11:14.760 --> 11:15.760
Hullo.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.800
Who got us out of the Dart?

11:20.160 --> 11:21.160
Zelenka,

11:21.200 --> 11:23.920
but he only got you out.
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.

11:23.960 --> 11:24.720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.320
This cannot... be happening.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.720
Cadman's not trapped in the Dart.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.040
Excuse me?

11:31.360 --> 11:32.960
She's in here.

11:38.870 --> 11:39.990
Oh, nice work!

11:40.030 --> 11:43.070
We were running out of power.
I knew hardly anything about the machine.

11:43.110 --> 11:44.910
Who would have thought this
could be one of the side effects?

11:44.950 --> 11:50.470
So instead of waiting to understand what it was
you were doing, you just sort of mashed
on the keyboard hoping something would happen!

11:50.510 --> 11:51.950
Well, you're alive, aren't you?

11:51.990 --> 11:53.430
Ask him if he knows how to fix it.

11:53.470 --> 11:55.470
He doesn't know how to fix it!

11:55.710 --> 11:56.510
What?

11:56.710 --> 11:57.830
I'm talking to her!

11:57.910 --> 11:58.950
You can hear her thoughts?

11:58.990 --> 12:03.990
No, not her thoughts, thank God. I can hear when
she's speaking... when she's trying to speak.

12:04.110 --> 12:06.910
Are you sure he should have been
discharged from the infirmary, Carson?

12:06.950 --> 12:10.150
According to the MRI, he's as healthy as he ever was.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.390
It doesn't feel very healthy in here!

12:12.430 --> 12:14.830
Well, we can't all be track stars, now, can we?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.430
It was her again.

12:18.470 --> 12:22.630
Maybe there's something wrong an MRI
wouldn't pick up, if you know what I mean.

12:23.470 --> 12:27.310
I'm not crazy I just have
another consciousness in my brain.

12:27.950 --> 12:29.550
So he just looks crazy.

12:29.555 --> 12:33.755
I'm sure I do, but only because
Doctor Fumbles McStupid over here

12:33.790 --> 12:35.630
- was in way over his head!
- Yes,...

12:35.670 --> 12:39.510
yes, I made a mistake trying to save YOUR life.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.030
Now, do you want to try to fix it,
or do you want to continue to berate me somewhat?

12:43.070 --> 12:45.110
I'm perfectly capable of doing
both at the same time.

12:45.150 --> 12:47.110
Now I assume you've tried to run
one of our own generators on it?

12:47.150 --> 12:48.310
It's not as simple as that ...

12:48.350 --> 12:49.150
Why not?

12:49.190 --> 12:52.070
the trick is having it interface
with the Wraith machine in real time.

12:52.110 --> 12:55.550
The power fluctuations are, are, are huge.
...If we overshoot just a little ...

12:55.590 --> 12:57.190
<i>- Wait, wait, what does that mean?</i>
- ... we're screwed up.

12:57.230 --> 12:58.350
Yeah, yeah.

12:58.390 --> 13:01.310
Um, I'm sure if we can maybe run an interface
programme that will take care of all the ...

13:01.350 --> 13:04.550
Hullooo?  Rodney?  Will you please answer me?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.950
- Here's what I want us to try.
- Rodney!

13:06.990 --> 13:10.510
- We'll take a... Naquadah generator...
- Ro-o-o-odney!

13:10.590 --> 13:12.190
- ... and...
- Rodney.  Rodney!

13:12.270 --> 13:13.830
- ... and...
- Rodney!

13:13.910 --> 13:16.270
- RODNEY!
- YES!  WHAT?!

13:18.310 --> 13:19.270
Stop ignoring me.

13:19.310 --> 13:21.910
Well, stop asking stupid questions!

13:22.310 --> 13:23.150
Rodney...

13:23.190 --> 13:25.230
I will get you out of here, OK?

13:25.270 --> 13:27.670
Now just be a good little girlie and keep quiet.

13:27.710 --> 13:31.950
Don't you dare condescend me!
This is as much my problem as it is yours.

13:31.990 --> 13:33.270
And do you have a degree in physics?

13:33.310 --> 13:35.150
Well, what about mechanical engineering?

13:35.190 --> 13:36.790
- Rodney?
- Yes!

13:37.710 --> 13:39.390
Sorry. I'm sorry.

13:39.430 --> 13:40.590
What, please?

13:42.910 --> 13:44.910
Why don't we let Zelenka handle this?

13:44.950 --> 13:46.590
- I'm fine.
<i>- No.</i>

13:46.710 --> 13:47.630
You're not.

13:47.670 --> 13:49.710
And I'd like you to talk to Doctor Heightmeyer.

13:50.110 --> 13:52.910
- I think it'd be more useful if I was...
<i>- Rodney.</i>

13:55.630 --> 13:57.310
I'm not asking you.

14:10.710 --> 14:11.710
Fine.

14:15.710 --> 14:18.510
Oh, stop sulking. You're acting like a two year old.

14:18.550 --> 14:19.630
This is your fault, you know.

14:19.670 --> 14:20.550
How'd you figure that?

14:20.590 --> 14:22.830
All you had to do was keep your mouth
shut while I was working.

14:22.870 --> 14:25.830
You have no idea what it's like in here, OK?

14:25.870 --> 14:30.390
Yes, yes, I do. I know exactly what it's like
in here because I live in here. I like it here!

14:30.430 --> 14:31.390
Rodney?

14:31.430 --> 14:32.030
Be cool!

14:32.070 --> 14:34.310
Katie! Hi.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.150
Is... everything OK?

14:36.710 --> 14:40.070
Yes! Yes! Everything is just fine. I was just...

14:40.110 --> 14:41.830
Talking on the radio! Talking on the radio!

14:41.870 --> 14:43.390
Talking on the radio.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.510
You're well, I take it?

14:47.390 --> 14:51.710
I... heard you ran into some trouble offworld today.

14:51.750 --> 14:56.510
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, but everything's fine now
it's all been sorted out. Back to normal.

14:56.710 --> 14:57.910
Good.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.110
So we're still on for tomorrow?

15:00.150 --> 15:02.390
Yes, yes. Yes, actually, I'm...

15:02.910 --> 15:04.470
very much looking forward to it.

15:04.510 --> 15:06.710
In fact, I'm sure it'll be a...

15:07.110 --> 15:08.990
you know, a wonderful...

15:09.390 --> 15:10.990
evening, and what not.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.630
Right! Well, I'll see you then.

15:17.110 --> 15:19.550
You really know nothing about women, do you?

15:19.590 --> 15:20.910
I know plenty.

15:21.230 --> 15:22.910
Maybe this is a good thing.

15:23.110 --> 15:23.990
Excuse me?

15:24.030 --> 15:26.790
I could teach you a thing or two
about the opposite sex, McKay.

15:26.830 --> 15:28.310
Lord knows you need it!

15:29.510 --> 15:32.310
This is hell! This is my own personal hell!

15:57.630 --> 15:58.750
Alright.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.790
Let's try that again.

16:02.310 --> 16:03.910
How about you try that again...

16:03.950 --> 16:05.150
<i>Sir?</i>

16:06.110 --> 16:08.710
Maybe that's enough for today.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.870
How do you feel you're qualified
to help us with this problem?

16:13.910 --> 16:14.710
I'm not.

16:15.310 --> 16:18.110
Who could be? This was not covered in medical school!

16:18.150 --> 16:20.950
But I have spent quite
some time as a couples therapist.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.030
We're not a couple!

16:22.070 --> 16:24.790
In any sense of the definition not a couple.

16:24.870 --> 16:25.670
No!

16:26.510 --> 16:32.270
In physics, a couple is defined as a pair of forces
equal in magnitude acting in opposite directions.

16:32.310 --> 16:33.910
So you don't feel that applies here?

16:33.950 --> 16:36.110
Yeah, that's very clever, but we're not equal forces.

16:36.150 --> 16:36.950
Watch it!

16:37.110 --> 16:41.110
And what I mean by that is she's just a voice
in my head, I have control of the body.

16:41.150 --> 16:43.750
I've seen your body, McKay, you can keep it.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.670
How do you know that?

16:45.830 --> 16:51.030
She's been able to access the part of your brain that
creates speech and controls hearing why not movement?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.310
Well if she could have, she would have by now.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.510
Maybe you need to release control.

16:55.830 --> 16:57.110
Why would I do that?

16:57.150 --> 17:00.190
Because, like it or not, you're sharing that body.

17:00.230 --> 17:04.150
The roles could have easily been reversed, Rodney,
you could be trapped inside her body.

17:04.190 --> 17:08.109
And wouldn't you like a chance to say,
talk to others without having to go through her?

17:08.150 --> 17:09.069
Yeah!

17:09.510 --> 17:10.310
Maybe.

17:10.349 --> 17:12.910
- Maybe?
- OK, yes, I would want that.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.589
So let her.

17:16.349 --> 17:17.950
Close your eyes,

17:19.030 --> 17:23.230
take deep breaths and stop
trying to control everything for a second.

17:26.109 --> 17:27.109
<i>(Hello?)</i>

17:28.830 --> 17:29.830
<i>(Hello?)</i>

17:30.910 --> 17:31.910
Laura?

17:32.110 --> 17:34.110
<i>(Oh, this is weird!)</i>

17:34.430 --> 17:37.030
<i>(Hearing his voice when I speak!)</i>

17:37.870 --> 17:39.070
Can you move?

17:39.310 --> 17:40.310
<i>(I don't know.)</i>

17:40.350 --> 17:41.550
<i>(Let me try.)</i>

17:46.310 --> 17:47.710
OK, that's enough of that.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.110
Oh, come on!

17:49.150 --> 17:51.110
Doctor McKay, we were just starting to make progress.

17:51.150 --> 17:53.750
Well, progress won't be necessary
if we can get her out of here.

17:53.790 --> 17:57.870
Now, I have calmed down, so has she.
Let me get back to work.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.110
OK.

17:59.910 --> 18:03.110
Really? Oh, she... she's fine with this, by the way.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.350
- Sorta.
- Sorta. So, yeah, should I...?

18:06.110 --> 18:09.110
This is a P-90. It's a compact, lightweight,

18:09.310 --> 18:11.510
incredibly sturdy for...

18:16.510 --> 18:17.510
Good!

18:18.150 --> 18:19.110
That's...

18:19.150 --> 18:20.150
good.

18:21.110 --> 18:22.310
Alright...

18:22.350 --> 18:23.910
This is a nine millimetre,

18:23.950 --> 18:25.150
semi-automatic...

18:30.910 --> 18:32.110
That's good too!

18:32.470 --> 18:33.870
I prefer this.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.710
I can see why you would!

18:51.110 --> 18:53.590
Alright! Let's give this bad boy a try.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.390
Start her up and slowly ease her into it.

18:55.430 --> 18:58.110
No, no, no, no. It's not ready.
Some of these calculations are not right.

18:58.150 --> 19:00.350
Maybe you just don't understand them.

19:05.230 --> 19:06.870
What the hell happened?

19:06.910 --> 19:07.910
We started it up.

19:07.950 --> 19:10.270
I said slowly ease her into it!

19:10.310 --> 19:12.230
I was at three percent.

19:12.270 --> 19:15.150
The power requirements are delicate.
We should have run more simulations before we...

19:15.190 --> 19:17.390
Yes, yes! Twenty-twenty hindsight.

19:17.430 --> 19:18.710
You shouldn't be here.

19:18.750 --> 19:19.550
I'm sorry?

19:19.590 --> 19:22.790
We are telling you these calculations are wrong.

19:23.310 --> 19:26.910
Having two consciousnesses inside
of a single brain must be very taxing.

19:26.950 --> 19:27.670
Listen...

19:27.710 --> 19:30.110
You're making mistakes.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.310
Now leave it to me,

19:37.350 --> 19:39.550
before you do more harm than good.

19:54.730 --> 19:55.930
You're up late.

19:56.730 --> 19:57.930
I...

19:57.935 --> 20:00.935
couldn't sleep I was, uh, trying to clear my head.

20:01.210 --> 20:04.730
I, uh, hear the transformer test didn't go so well.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.450
Well, you heard right.

20:07.730 --> 20:08.850
Uh, listen.

20:09.210 --> 20:11.530
I wanted you to know that

20:11.570 --> 20:14.170
I gave the command to take the Dart down.

20:14.210 --> 20:20.410
Well, much as I'd like to pretend that this is remotely
your fault, the thought of what would've happened
if you hadn't shot the Dart down is...

20:20.450 --> 20:21.330
So,

20:21.370 --> 20:22.290
we're cool.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.010
No, you're cool, I'm fine.

20:25.210 --> 20:26.810
You should get some sleep.

20:27.410 --> 20:29.810
I could actually use some rest, Rodney.

20:30.810 --> 20:32.210
She says she's tired.

20:34.410 --> 20:35.410
Goodnight.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.010
<i>(Busy?)</i>

21:27.610 --> 21:29.010
No, no. Come in.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.290
How're you feeling?

21:32.330 --> 21:33.330
<i>(Fine.)</i>

21:34.610 --> 21:35.610
Really?

21:36.810 --> 21:38.610
<i>(Merely because of Cadman.)</i>

21:38.730 --> 21:41.130
<i>(She's calming, you know?)</i>

21:41.810 --> 21:45.610
<i>(Between you and me, I am damned lucky it was her.)</i>

21:46.410 --> 21:47.490
Should you, uh...?

21:47.530 --> 21:49.330
<i>(Oh, she's asleep can't hear a thing.)</i>

21:49.810 --> 21:52.170
Well, yes, then, she seems like a lovely lady.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.810
<i>(Oh! That is so nice!)</i>

21:57.810 --> 21:58.810
<i>(Oh...)</i>

21:59.170 --> 22:00.370
<i>(you wanna...)</i>

22:00.650 --> 22:01.850
<i>(do me a favour?)</i>

22:01.890 --> 22:04.930
<i>(You know, you wanna, uh,
ride shotgun on this date tomorrow night?)</i>

22:06.210 --> 22:07.450
With Doctor Brown?

22:07.490 --> 22:08.490
<i>(Katie.)</i>

22:08.610 --> 22:10.170
You're going through with it?

22:10.210 --> 22:14.010
<i>(Well, I've cancelled on her so many times.
I don't wanna mess this up.)</i>

22:17.210 --> 22:18.490
But what d'you want me to do?

22:18.970 --> 22:24.010
<i>(Listen. I don't think it's any big secret
that I am terrible with women.)</i>

22:24.050 --> 22:28.850
<i>(Having someone there to cut me off when I start
making a fool of myself would be a great help.)</i>

22:31.130 --> 22:33.330
<i>(I'd consider it a personal favour.)</i>

22:37.130 --> 22:38.650
OK, Rodney, fine.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.530
<i>(Great!)</i>

22:42.210 --> 22:43.410
<i>(And, thanks!)</i>

23:10.570 --> 23:11.770
Where am I?

23:14.090 --> 23:15.490
Where are my clothes?

23:16.210 --> 23:18.930
Can't we sleep just a little longer?

23:20.050 --> 23:23.810
- It is two in the afternoon! Where the hell are we?
- We're in my room. Your mattress sucks.

23:23.850 --> 23:27.010
That is a prescription mattress I need that for
my back. Now, how the hell did we get here?

23:27.050 --> 23:29.450
- I walked here while you were sleeping.
- You did what?

23:29.490 --> 23:32.210
Yeah, well, it was a lot easier
to use your body when you were asleep.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.330
Pants!

23:33.370 --> 23:36.170
- Where are my pants?
- They're over on the chair.

23:39.610 --> 23:40.610
Seen it!

23:41.810 --> 23:42.970
We have gotta set some boundaries!

23:43.010 --> 23:45.650
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I'm kinda used to sleeping in the buff.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.690
You have crossed a line here, Cadman.

23:47.730 --> 23:50.450
I guarantee it was more traumatic for me.

23:53.210 --> 23:54.170
Why are my legs burning?

23:54.210 --> 23:56.450
Oh, I took us for a run before we went to bed.

23:56.490 --> 23:58.170
Why in the world would you do that?

23:58.210 --> 23:59.890
Because it helps me unwind.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.850
OK, OK. This is very important.

24:02.890 --> 24:06.010
Did you ingest any citrus?
I am deathly allergic to citrus.

24:07.810 --> 24:12.410
Rodney, look I worked out, I came here
and I went to bed. Jeez, loosen up!

24:12.450 --> 24:16.570
I would love to, but every muscle in my body
is sore from your stupid workout!

24:16.610 --> 24:19.130
So what's on the board for today?

24:19.170 --> 24:21.170
More of the same. Why do you have any ideas?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.210
Yeah actually I do.

24:24.530 --> 24:25.930
Don't look!

24:38.090 --> 24:40.490
I thought we were supposed to be sparring today?

24:40.930 --> 24:43.410
You were late. So Ronon and I...

24:48.850 --> 24:51.210
What the hell do you think you're doing?

24:52.810 --> 24:54.210
I wouldn't have hurt her.

24:55.010 --> 24:57.410
You sure in hell looked like you were going to.

24:58.410 --> 25:00.210
- You OK?
- I am fine.

25:06.610 --> 25:08.610
I told him that he did not have to go easy on me.

25:08.650 --> 25:11.450
You've gotta be careful what you say to this guy.

25:14.810 --> 25:16.290
No, it is completely out of the question.

25:16.330 --> 25:18.130
Why? You'd rather go it alone?

25:18.170 --> 25:20.090
Oh yes, imagine that, I'd rather go it alone!

25:20.130 --> 25:21.890
Well, consider the opportunity, right?

25:21.930 --> 25:23.450
To have a woman there with you,

25:23.490 --> 25:24.330
helping you out,

25:24.370 --> 25:25.530
feeding you lines.

25:25.570 --> 25:27.290
I really think you could learn something.

25:27.330 --> 25:30.210
Thank you for the offer,
Cyrano, but I think I'll pass.

25:30.250 --> 25:34.490
I was there when you bumped into her, OK?
I felt how nervous and awkward you were.

25:34.530 --> 25:37.610
Well I'm sure that has nothing
to do with my current situation.

25:37.650 --> 25:40.130
C'mon, Rodney, let me do this for you!

25:40.170 --> 25:42.330
Maybe this is why this happened.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.370
This is why this happened?

25:43.410 --> 25:44.450
- Yeah.
- Are you insane?

25:44.490 --> 25:48.290
Considering our situation here,
I think I've been extremely reasonable.

25:48.295 --> 25:50.535
I can make this a living hell for you, Rodney.

25:50.570 --> 25:53.210
This is something I wanna do, and we're doing it.

26:11.410 --> 26:13.410
I wanted to apologise.

26:14.730 --> 26:16.130
Come in.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.050
Do not worry, Ronon.

26:21.090 --> 26:24.530
It was ... impressive.

26:25.290 --> 26:26.690
Please.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.530
How are you finding your training?

26:29.570 --> 26:32.450
You mean my test.

26:33.010 --> 26:34.610
Is that what you think?

26:35.370 --> 26:37.210
Am I wrong?

26:37.215 --> 26:40.615
Colonel Sheppard believes
you can be of great help to us.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.730
Why did you join them?

26:46.370 --> 26:50.770
My people are strong and proud,

26:51.810 --> 26:55.410
but Atlantis is the best hope for us all.

26:56.810 --> 27:00.730
I suspect you see it too,
or you would have already left.

27:02.610 --> 27:06.210
I am so sorry. I thought
he told you that I'd be joining you for dinner.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.810
Well, he has been under a lot of stress lately.

27:08.850 --> 27:11.170
Yes in fact that's why I'm here.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.650
Is he alright?

27:12.890 --> 27:14.570
I'm late sorry. Hi.

27:15.090 --> 27:16.650
Carson kept me company.

27:16.690 --> 27:19.490
Sit down the first course is all set to go.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.050
- Carson?
- Rodney.

27:21.090 --> 27:21.970
What are you doing here?

27:21.975 --> 27:24.535
- You invited me!
- Oh, I did, did I?

27:24.850 --> 27:25.890
Yes?

27:26.170 --> 27:27.250
Please,

27:27.290 --> 27:28.490
sit.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.730
Don't start eating, you idiot! Make a toast first!

27:39.770 --> 27:40.970
Yes, yes,

27:41.130 --> 27:42.330
yes!

27:44.050 --> 27:45.450
A toast

27:45.930 --> 27:47.330
to you.

27:47.850 --> 27:49.530
We've been working together for...

27:49.535 --> 27:52.375
some time now, a short time, but...

27:52.930 --> 27:55.770
in that time I've...

27:55.810 --> 27:59.130
often found our interchanges very...

28:00.370 --> 28:02.450
What I mean to say is that...

28:02.490 --> 28:04.290
you're very funny,

28:04.330 --> 28:06.570
and smart, and...

28:09.570 --> 28:13.570
from what I can tell, you... make a delicious salad.

28:13.970 --> 28:14.970
So,

28:15.130 --> 28:16.330
to you.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.050
Yes, cheers!

28:18.090 --> 28:19.650
Very good! That wasn't so bad.

28:19.690 --> 28:23.290
She's obviously into you, so at least
we have that working for us. Now, I was thinking

28:23.330 --> 28:25.010
that we m...

28:25.050 --> 28:26.210
Wait, McKay.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.210
McKay.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.490
Stop drinking the wine. You're gonna get drunk.

28:29.530 --> 28:32.970
Actually, wait, yes!
You need that to loosen up a bit. Finish it off!

28:33.010 --> 28:35.890
Good boy! Yeah!

28:42.970 --> 28:46.970
Say something, McKay!
C'mon, say something that'll start a conversation.

28:48.570 --> 28:50.650
So...

28:51.290 --> 28:53.330
do you...

28:58.970 --> 29:00.370
Yes?

29:00.970 --> 29:02.970
Forgot what I was gonna say.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.250
What was it?

29:09.210 --> 29:12.610
<i>(OK, this is ridiculous.)</i>

29:18.370 --> 29:19.370
<i>(Katie,)</i>

29:19.610 --> 29:21.610
<i>(I really like you.)</i>

29:21.890 --> 29:22.890
<i>(In fact,)</i>

29:22.930 --> 29:25.650
<i>(the past few months here
have been made more liveable)</i>

29:25.690 --> 29:27.090
<i>(thanks to you.)</i>

29:28.890 --> 29:31.610
<i>(I wanted tonight to be special,)</i>

29:31.850 --> 29:34.250
<i>(but for reasons I can't go into now,)</i>

29:34.290 --> 29:36.090
<i>(I gotta leave.)</i>

29:39.410 --> 29:40.930
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:40.970 --> 29:44.010
<i>(But I don't want you to be insulted)</i>

29:44.015 --> 29:47.535
<i>(or to wonder whether
or not I am interested in you.)</i>

29:47.570 --> 29:49.170
<i>(Because I am...)</i>

29:49.210 --> 29:50.930
<i>(I am very)</i>

29:52.090 --> 29:53.290
<i>(very,)</i>

29:53.610 --> 29:55.570
<i>(interested.)</i>

30:05.050 --> 30:06.850
<i>(See you soon.)</i>

30:17.970 --> 30:20.290
Give me back my body! We have to go back.

30:20.330 --> 30:25.330
<i>(And do what? I bet that is the most honest
you've ever been with a girl and it wasn't even you!)</i>

30:25.730 --> 30:28.130
Why are you doing this?

30:28.170 --> 30:32.050
<i>(We're just trying to do too much too fast, McKay.)</i>

30:32.090 --> 30:34.410
We should, we should go back.

30:34.450 --> 30:35.650
<i>(Nope!)</i>

30:35.770 --> 30:36.970
Alright

30:37.010 --> 30:39.890
rock, paper, scissors.
I'm the left hand, you're the right.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.210
Cadman!

30:41.250 --> 30:42.170
<i>(Fine.)</i>

30:43.490 --> 30:45.890
<i>(Yay! Paper beats rock we leave.)</i>

30:45.930 --> 30:47.450
No, we...

30:49.010 --> 30:51.570
<i>(Get a hold of yourself, man!)</i>

30:51.610 --> 30:54.490
<i>Doctor McKay, report to the hangar.
Doctor McKay, report to the hangar.</i>

30:54.530 --> 30:56.530
Hello! That's us!

30:58.530 --> 31:00.130
Thank you!

31:04.850 --> 31:07.890
We've been running simulations all day.
I think I may finally have something.

31:07.930 --> 31:14.210
I was able to get the generator to run on a buffer
loop which tricks the Dart into taking only
the power that it needs without overloading.

31:14.450 --> 31:16.850
Great. Good thinking. Can we, just, see it?

31:17.130 --> 31:18.530
Anxious?

31:18.690 --> 31:19.690
Yes.

31:19.970 --> 31:20.970
OK.

31:21.330 --> 31:22.330
Firing.

31:28.690 --> 31:29.810
Alright.

31:29.850 --> 31:32.250
Lifesigns holding steady.

31:32.330 --> 31:35.490
Now, rematerialisation initiated.

31:41.010 --> 31:43.010
<i>Now I'm no scientist,</i>

31:43.050 --> 31:45.450
but those mice used to be a different colour.

31:45.490 --> 31:47.090
<i>This is never gonna end!</i>

31:47.890 --> 31:49.490
I'm gonna be stuck like this

31:49.530 --> 31:50.970
forever!

31:58.530 --> 32:00.290
I'm not sure it's a good idea, John.

32:00.330 --> 32:04.090
Elizabeth, you've gotta see this guy in action.
He is an incredible shot

32:04.095 --> 32:06.655
none of my guys can beat him
in a fight and he's ex-military.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.450
Not a military on Earth.

32:08.530 --> 32:10.050
The guy's got no place to go.

32:10.090 --> 32:11.610
You're not just being charitable?

32:11.615 --> 32:15.335
No, I'm not and I think he'd make
a great addition to my team.

32:15.370 --> 32:16.890
We don't know anything about him.

32:16.930 --> 32:17.930
Well, what's there to know?

32:17.970 --> 32:21.410
Well, anything would be helpful.
He's not very forthcoming.

32:21.450 --> 32:25.090
He's been on the run from the Wraith
for the past seven years. What do you expect? Listen

32:25.095 --> 32:28.695
just talk to the guy. You owe him that at least.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.850
OK.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.610
I would like an apology.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.210
Laura?

32:42.250 --> 32:43.650
<i>(Forget about it!)</i>

32:43.655 --> 32:45.735
You did take over his body without permission.

32:45.890 --> 32:47.810
<i>(He doesn't ask permission when he takes over.)</i>

32:47.850 --> 32:49.610
You... because it's my body!

32:49.650 --> 32:50.610
<i>(Yeah,)</i>

32:50.650 --> 32:53.450
<i>(and I'm a guest.
Try and be a little more courteous.)</i>

32:53.490 --> 32:55.930
You see?! You see what I have to put up with!

32:56.010 --> 32:57.210
<i>(Put up with?)</i>

32:57.250 --> 33:01.250
There's a lot of stuff that
I'm not doing right now that I would be doing!

33:01.290 --> 33:03.490
<i>(- I don't wanna hear about it...)</i>
- Alright, you two.

33:03.530 --> 33:04.930
<i>Settle down.</i>

33:08.290 --> 33:11.730
Thigh, strip, cut, lift, cut...

33:12.290 --> 33:13.730
and finish.

33:14.050 --> 33:15.450
Awesome!

33:16.330 --> 33:17.530
Ronon.

33:18.210 --> 33:19.970
Could I have a word?

33:21.930 --> 33:22.930
Here.

33:25.850 --> 33:29.770
I understand Major Sheppard extended
an invitation to you to join his team.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.375
Yeah, he did.

33:31.930 --> 33:35.450
Well, he was supposed to speak to me about that first.

33:36.130 --> 33:37.970
OK.

33:38.810 --> 33:41.570
Look, it's not that I don't trust you, or

33:41.610 --> 33:45.210
value any contributions you may have to make,

33:45.650 --> 33:51.050
or that you will make if you do join us
it's just it is a rather big decision.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.330
So how do you feel?

33:56.370 --> 33:57.770
I'm thinkin' about it.

33:57.890 --> 34:01.410
OK, good!  Well, I'm thinkin' about it too.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.575
<i>So I guess we'll just keep in touch, then?</i>

34:03.610 --> 34:04.810
OK.

34:06.610 --> 34:07.810
OK!

34:07.850 --> 34:09.090
Alright

34:09.409 --> 34:12.370
remember the leading arm. Two knives.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.010
Slice, cut!

34:14.050 --> 34:15.810
You're the one who said set up rules.  Well, I did.

34:15.850 --> 34:19.250
I followed them I stuck to them.
She basically hijacked me.

34:19.290 --> 34:20.530
<i>(Hey,)</i>

34:20.690 --> 34:26.290
<i>(you had a real opportunity to get inside the mind
of a woman and actually expand your horizons,)</i>

34:26.330 --> 34:27.610
<i>(but no-o-o-o-o.)</i>

34:27.650 --> 34:31.969
Did you ever for a second consider that I might
not want to get inside a woman's...

34:32.010 --> 34:33.050
Rodney!

34:33.090 --> 34:34.090
Rodney?

34:34.130 --> 34:35.250
Rodney?

34:41.810 --> 34:45.210
This is Heightmeyer. Get Beckett in here, stat.

34:56.090 --> 34:56.969
What happened?

34:57.010 --> 34:57.770
You had a seizure.

34:57.810 --> 34:58.530
Why?

34:58.570 --> 35:03.090
From what we can tell, the constant
fighting over the dominance of your brain is
having a deleterious effect on its lower functions

35:03.130 --> 35:05.770
heart rate, respiration, organ function...

35:05.810 --> 35:08.010
<i>(- That's not good.)
- Of course it's not good!</i>

35:08.050 --> 35:10.050
- I'm not sure how long you can go on like this.
- What do you mean?

35:10.090 --> 35:12.930
These misfires will
only increase in frequency and severity over time.

35:12.970 --> 35:14.290
Well, fine,
she'll stop trying to take over control of my body.

35:14.330 --> 35:15.850
It's not as simple as that, Rodney.

35:15.890 --> 35:19.290
One of you has to release control.
One of you has to let go completely.

35:19.330 --> 35:23.770
Ah, well, maybe if someone say,
you hadn't told her to try and take control
in the first place, none of this would have happened.

35:23.810 --> 35:25.810
I was just trying to help both of you.

35:25.850 --> 35:29.450
What happens to the person the one who lets go?

35:29.770 --> 35:33.570
Well, we're not certain, of course
we've not often run into these situations before...

35:33.610 --> 35:35.370
<i>(They would disappear.)</i>

35:35.410 --> 35:38.650
<i>(I know they would,
cos I can already feel it happening to me.)</i>

35:38.690 --> 35:40.770
<i>(It's getting harder to be in here.)</i>

35:40.810 --> 35:42.610
<i>(It's taking more of an effort.)</i>

35:42.850 --> 35:44.290
Has it always been like that?

35:44.330 --> 35:45.770
<i>(Past few hours.)</i>

35:45.810 --> 35:47.210
<i>(You haven't felt it too?)</i>

35:47.215 --> 35:49.975
Well, of course
I have I just thought I was fighting with you.

35:50.010 --> 35:51.930
Look where're we at?

35:53.210 --> 35:56.610
Well, we've
successfully rematerialised a pair of mice.

35:56.650 --> 35:59.010
<i>They were whole and correctly reconstructed...</i>

35:59.015 --> 36:00.215
But?

36:01.010 --> 36:03.010
They didn't survive.

36:05.810 --> 36:08.650
I'm afraid if one of you doesn't let go,

36:09.090 --> 36:11.290
both of you will die.

36:12.410 --> 36:14.010
I'll do it.

36:16.210 --> 36:18.610
Which one of you said that?

36:26.110 --> 36:27.070
You don't have to do this.

36:27.110 --> 36:31.030
Yes I do, Rodney.
It's your body and you're not gonna do it.

36:31.070 --> 36:32.150
Oh, what makes you so sure?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.190
They need you here, and

36:34.550 --> 36:37.350
as much as I hate to admit it
I'm not as important as...

36:37.390 --> 36:38.590
Stop it!

36:39.230 --> 36:40.430
It's not true.

36:40.790 --> 36:41.990
<i>(Carson!)</i>

36:43.070 --> 36:44.990
<i>(I need something to write with.)</i>

36:45.030 --> 36:46.310
What're you doing?

36:46.350 --> 36:48.270
I wanna write a letter to my folks.

36:48.310 --> 36:53.670
I'd appreciate it if you'd deliver it yourself
the next time you gate back to Earth,
Rodney explain what happened.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.310
Well, I'm not sure when I'll...

36:55.630 --> 36:56.750
The Gate!

36:56.790 --> 36:58.590
We can use the Gate!

36:58.910 --> 37:00.710
What're you talkin' about?

37:00.790 --> 37:04.990
Well, the Gate dematerialises you as you
step into it, sending your information to the next
Gate so it can be rematerialised on the other side.

37:05.030 --> 37:06.550
Well, we know that.

37:06.555 --> 37:11.435
So if we can take one of the crystal control
modules from the Gate and interface it with the
Dart, we should be able to build a safer system.

37:11.470 --> 37:13.590
Rodney, wait. I don't
think you're in any condition to do this, Rodney.

37:13.630 --> 37:17.030
I don't have time to talk
I need to get this done before the next seizure.

37:24.470 --> 37:25.750
Alright, let's do this.

37:25.755 --> 37:27.675
Just because it works in simulation doesn't mean ...

37:27.710 --> 37:33.310
I would prefer
not to suffer a fatal seizure while we wait for you
to round up more mice protesting. So, shall we?

37:33.470 --> 37:34.270
Rodney.

37:34.310 --> 37:36.590
Don't try to talk me out of this
I may very well listen.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.750
I was just gonna say thanks.

37:39.790 --> 37:44.070
Well, you're welcome. I can honestly say
that the entire experience has been very ...

37:44.110 --> 37:45.110
Ah, about time.

37:45.150 --> 37:47.150
Hold on, Rodney I thought all the mice died?

37:47.190 --> 37:49.590
Well, what are we mice or men?

37:49.750 --> 37:51.670
Are you sure about this?

37:51.675 --> 37:53.315
Absolutely, yes.

37:59.550 --> 38:02.750
- OK.
- Just ... give me a second.

38:07.030 --> 38:09.870
Well, Laura, it's been,...

38:10.190 --> 38:11.190
unique.

38:11.195 --> 38:12.475
To say the least!

38:12.670 --> 38:14.230
Good luck to us both, right?

38:14.270 --> 38:15.310
Alright.

38:17.390 --> 38:18.710
It's ready.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.630
I suggest you take a step back.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.870
Alright.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.270
Wait!

38:41.950 --> 38:43.950
<i>(Just in case this doesn't work.)</i>

38:50.910 --> 38:52.510
Just, just

38:53.030 --> 38:54.270
hit it.

39:00.750 --> 39:01.550
OK

39:01.590 --> 39:03.990
it's reading as two lifesigns.
Power levels are steady...

39:04.030 --> 39:06.350
Get them out of there!

39:15.030 --> 39:17.230
Let's get them to the infirmary.

39:20.630 --> 39:23.630
Did you get the chance to talk to Ronon?

39:23.670 --> 39:26.270
Yes, I did. Chatty fellow, isn't he?!

39:26.630 --> 39:27.950
And?

39:28.750 --> 39:31.230
- He would be your responsibility.
- I knew you'd say yes!

39:31.270 --> 39:34.270
- I haven't said yes.
- Well, you were about to.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.790
- Yes.
- There y'go!

39:52.910 --> 39:54.510
<i>Feelin' better?</i>

39:59.590 --> 40:01.430
Oh no!

40:02.630 --> 40:04.630
<i>Over here!</i>

40:10.670 --> 40:12.670
A little less crowded. You?

40:12.710 --> 40:15.990
Same. It's nice to have my own body back.

40:15.995 --> 40:17.475
You are doing supremely well.

40:17.510 --> 40:19.750
Ah, good to hear.

40:19.790 --> 40:21.310
Nice work.

40:22.070 --> 40:25.030
- Well, it was your idea.
- Well, of course it was, but you...

40:25.070 --> 40:26.350
you were...

40:26.390 --> 40:27.590
there.

40:29.070 --> 40:32.350
Lieutenant, way to survive
what I think may be my worst nightmare.

40:32.390 --> 40:33.990
Thank you, Sir!

40:34.030 --> 40:36.030
Yes, thank you!

40:36.350 --> 40:39.150
I imagine you two might want a moment.

40:39.190 --> 40:42.070
Actually, ma'am, I think I'd like some time alone.

40:42.110 --> 40:44.830
Same here. It's... been a while.

40:44.870 --> 40:46.710
Alright. Release them as soon as you can.

40:46.790 --> 40:47.990
Aye.
