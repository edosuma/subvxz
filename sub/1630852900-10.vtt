WEBVTT

00:32.966 --> 00:34.567
>> WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.634 --> 00:35.235
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.301 --> 00:40.106
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.341
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:41.408 --> 00:41.508
US.

00:41.574 --> 00:42.375
AND LOOK, IT HAS BEEN A TRULY

00:42.442 --> 00:43.710
TERRIBLE WEEK, ONE THAT STARTED

00:43.777 --> 00:44.778
WITH TWO JARED LETOS AT THE MET

00:44.844 --> 00:46.246
GALA, AND THEN SOMEHOW MANAGED

00:46.312 --> 00:48.281
TO GET WORSE FROM THERE, TO THE

00:48.348 --> 00:53.553
POINT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO

00:53.620 --> 00:56.856
SOMETHING UNUSUAL RIGHT NOW, AND

00:56.923 --> 00:57.624
THAT IS, TWO MAIN STORIES.

00:57.690 --> 00:58.425
AND OUR FIRST MAIN STORY TONIGHT

00:58.491 --> 00:59.392
CONCERNS THE FACT THAT THIS WEEK

00:59.459 --> 01:00.560
SAW THE LEAK OF A DRAFT OPINION

01:00.627 --> 01:01.261
WRITTEN BY JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO

01:01.327 --> 01:02.395
THAT LOOKS SET TO STRIKE DOWN

01:02.462 --> 01:03.463
ROE V. WADE.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.697
AND WHILE THE FATE OF ROE MAY

01:04.764 --> 01:05.732
NOT HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE, THE

01:05.799 --> 01:06.566
DRAFT ITSELF WAS STILL A HORROR

01:06.633 --> 01:07.600
SHOW.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.269
>> THE 67-PAGE DRAFT OPINION IS

01:09.335 --> 01:10.770
CLEAR, SHARP, AND SCORNFUL,

01:10.837 --> 01:12.505
DECLARING IN ITS OPENING

01:12.572 --> 01:14.808
PARAGRAPHS THAT ROE VERSUS WADE

01:14.874 --> 01:16.776
"MUST BE OVERRULED" AND THAT THE

01:16.843 --> 01:18.545
1972 RULING "WAS EGREGIOUSLY

01:18.611 --> 01:20.680
WRONG FROM THE START."

01:20.747 --> 01:21.648
ALITO DISMISSES THE ARGUMENT IN

01:21.714 --> 01:22.816
ROE VERSUS WADE THAT THE RIGHT

01:22.882 --> 01:24.384
TO CHOOSE ABORTION IS PART OF

01:24.451 --> 01:25.351
THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE

01:25.418 --> 01:27.187
OF LIBERTY AND PRIVACY,

01:27.253 --> 01:28.888
INSISTING "THE INESCAPABLE

01:28.955 --> 01:30.089
CONCLUSION IS THAT THE

01:30.156 --> 01:31.291
RIGHT TO ABORTION IS NOT DEEPLY

01:31.357 --> 01:32.926
ROOTED IN THE NATION'S HISTORY

01:32.992 --> 01:35.462
AND TRADITIONS."

01:35.528 --> 01:36.696
>> OKAY, BUT EVEN IF THAT

01:36.763 --> 01:38.431
WERE TRUE, WHICH, BY THE WAY,

01:38.498 --> 01:39.799
FUCK OFF, THE FRAMERS PROBABLY

01:39.866 --> 01:41.634
LEFT OFF THE SPECIFIC RIGHT TO

01:41.701 --> 01:42.302
ABORTION BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

01:42.368 --> 01:42.936
ANTICIPATE IT BEING SUCH A

01:43.002 --> 01:44.337
MASSIVE CONCERN.

01:44.404 --> 01:45.438
I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE

01:45.505 --> 01:49.776
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS DIDN'T

01:49.843 --> 01:50.376
HAVE ABORTION ON THEIR MINDS,

01:50.443 --> 01:53.546
THERE MUST BE SOME EXPLANATION.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.415
I JUST CAN'T QUITE PLACE THE

01:55.482 --> 01:58.017
EXACT REASON, BUT IT'S ON THE

01:58.084 --> 01:59.385
TIP OF MY PENIS.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.521
AND LOOK, ALITO WASN'T JUST

02:01.588 --> 02:02.322
DEFERRING TO THE CONSTITUTION,

02:02.388 --> 02:03.523
HE REPEATEDLY CITED SOME OTHER

02:03.590 --> 02:04.624
NOTABLE SOURCES, TOO, LIKE 17th

02:04.691 --> 02:05.959
CENTURY JURIST SIR MATTHEW HALE

02:06.025 --> 02:06.593
WHO ONCE DESCRIBED ABORTION AS A

02:06.659 --> 02:09.562
"GREAT CRIME."

02:09.629 --> 02:10.396
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL THAT HALE

02:10.463 --> 02:11.764
THOUGHT -- HE ALSO ARGUED THAT

02:11.831 --> 02:13.032
A HUSBAND CANNOT BE GUILTY OF A

02:13.099 --> 02:14.367
RAPE COMMITTED UPON HIS WIFE,

02:14.434 --> 02:15.768
SENTENCED TWO WOMEN TO DEATH FOR

02:15.835 --> 02:17.403
WITCHCRAFT, AND ARGUED YOUNG

02:17.470 --> 02:18.571
WOMEN WERE THE RUIN OF FAMILIES,

02:18.638 --> 02:20.373
BECAUSE THEY, AND, I QUOTE,

02:20.440 --> 02:21.040
"LEARN TO BE BOLD" AND "TALK

02:21.107 --> 02:23.142
LOUD."

02:23.209 --> 02:24.310
AND WHILE THOSE BELIEFS MIGHT

02:24.377 --> 02:27.046
EARN YOU A NETFLIX COMEDY

02:27.113 --> 02:28.081
SPECIAL CALLED, "TRIGGER THIS"

02:28.147 --> 02:29.616
THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY

02:29.682 --> 02:30.316
DISQUALIFY YOU AS A SCHOLARLY

02:30.383 --> 02:31.217
REFERENCE ON THE MATTER OF

02:31.284 --> 02:33.253
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.187
AND LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST

02:34.254 --> 02:35.088
TIME WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ABORTION

02:35.154 --> 02:36.523
ON THIS SHOW.

02:36.589 --> 02:41.294
IN FACT, THE FIRST TIME WE

02:41.361 --> 02:43.429
TALKED ABOUT IT IN DEPTH, WE

02:43.496 --> 02:45.865
REWARDED ANYONE FOR STICKING TO

02:45.932 --> 02:48.401
THE END OF THE STORY WITH A

02:48.468 --> 02:51.004
VIDEO OF SLOTHS PLAYING IN A

02:51.070 --> 02:53.273
BUCKET THAT WAS ALMOST

02:53.339 --> 02:53.773
CRIMINALLY JOYFUL.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.674
AND IF YOU'RE EXPECTING

02:54.741 --> 02:55.842
SOMETHING SIMILAR THIS TIME

02:55.909 --> 02:56.776
AROUND, I'VE GOT BAD NEWS FOR

02:56.843 --> 02:57.944
YOU, THOSE SLOTHS ARE DEAD NOW.

02:58.011 --> 02:58.778
ALL OF THEM, TWO FROM HEROIN.

02:58.845 --> 03:03.550
IT'S TIME TO GROW UP.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.585
BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

03:05.652 --> 03:06.419
TALK ABOUT ABORTION LIKE ADULTS.

03:06.486 --> 03:07.487
BECAUSE WHEN, AS SEEMS

03:07.554 --> 03:08.721
INEVITABLE, THIS RULING BECOMES

03:08.788 --> 03:09.556
OFFICIAL, THERE WILL BE

03:09.622 --> 03:10.290
IMMEDIATE AND DEVASTATING

03:10.356 --> 03:11.190
CONSEQUENCES.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.158
AND IT'S WORTH TAKING SOME TIME

03:12.225 --> 03:12.992
TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT A FEW

03:13.059 --> 03:13.993
WHAT THIS RULING MEANS,

03:14.060 --> 03:15.194
HOW WE GOT TO THIS POINT, AND

03:15.261 --> 03:16.296
WHERE WE GO NOW.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.530
AND WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THIS

03:17.597 --> 03:18.398
MEANS, IT'S CATASTROPHIC.

03:18.464 --> 03:19.866
IT'LL QUICKLY TRIGGER BANS ON

03:19.933 --> 03:24.070
ABORTION IN THESE 22 STATES.

03:24.137 --> 03:24.938
AND IF YOU ARE STILL UNAWARE OF

03:25.004 --> 03:26.339
JUST HOW UBIQUITOUS A PROCEDURE

03:26.406 --> 03:29.309
THIS IS, AN ESTIMATED 25% OF

03:29.375 --> 03:30.410
WOMEN HAVE AN ABORTION, AND

03:30.476 --> 03:30.977
6 IN 10 OF THEM ARE ALREADY

03:31.044 --> 03:32.579
PARENTS.

03:32.645 --> 03:34.080
SOME WHO GET ABORTIONS ARE

03:34.147 --> 03:35.114
SURVIVORS OF RAPE OR INCEST,

03:35.181 --> 03:36.549
OTHERS MIGHT NEED ONE FOR

03:36.616 --> 03:37.884
MEDICAL REASONS, BUT ALSO, JUST

03:37.951 --> 03:39.352
SOME WILL BE

03:39.419 --> 03:40.687
SEEKING AN ABORTION BECAUSE THEY

03:40.753 --> 03:42.322
FUCKING WANT ONE.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.022
AND THIS IS VERY MUCH ABOUT

03:43.089 --> 03:44.891
THEM, TOO.

03:44.958 --> 03:45.792
THIS A FIGHT FOR PEOPLE'S RIGHT

03:45.858 --> 03:46.326
TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR

03:46.392 --> 03:47.760
BODIES.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.862
IT'S ABOUT BODILY AUTONOMY.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.564
AND THE ONLY TIME IT'S OKAY TO

03:51.631 --> 03:53.099
ARGUE AGAINST THAT IS IF THE

03:53.166 --> 03:53.800
BODY IN QUESTION BELONGS TO

03:53.866 --> 03:55.535
ELMO.

03:55.602 --> 03:56.202
BECAUSE THEN, IT IS ACTUALLY

03:56.269 --> 03:58.471
FINE.

03:59.639 --> 04:00.907
HE LITERALLY CAN'T FUNCTION

04:00.974 --> 04:01.441
UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE IS

04:01.507 --> 04:03.109
ARM-FUCKING HIM FROM BELOW.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.877
BUT ANYTHING BEYOND THAT EXAMPLE

04:04.944 --> 04:07.013
IS JUST NOT OKAY.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.182
AND SOME CONSERVATIVES HAVE

04:09.248 --> 04:10.617
ARGUED THAT THE REACTION THIS

04:10.683 --> 04:11.884
WEEK HAS BEEN HYSTERICAL -- THAT

04:11.951 --> 04:15.488
THIS IS JUST RETURNING THE ISSUE

04:15.555 --> 04:22.295
TO THE STATES, AND THAT PEOPLE

04:22.362 --> 04:22.895
DO STILL HAVE A CHOICE.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.030
>> THIS IS NOT AN OPINION,

04:24.097 --> 04:24.631
BY THE WAY, THAT IS GOING TO

04:24.697 --> 04:25.231
UNDO ABORTION IN THIS COUNTRY.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.065
STATES MAY PUT SOME MORE

04:26.132 --> 04:26.699
RESTRICTIONS ON IT, BUT PEOPLE

04:26.766 --> 04:27.567
HAVE THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.

04:27.634 --> 04:28.501
THEY CAN GO LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE

04:28.568 --> 04:29.168
WHERE IT'S MORE OF A FREE FOR

04:29.235 --> 04:30.370
ALL AND THEY CAN DO WHATEVER

04:30.436 --> 04:31.270
THEY WANT.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.572
>> OKAY, FIRST, "WHERE

04:32.639 --> 04:33.640
IT'S MORE OF A FREE-FOR-ALL?"

04:33.706 --> 04:34.207
LET'S JUST GET ONE THING

04:34.273 --> 04:35.408
STRAIGHT.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.376
IF YOU MOVE TO DELAWARE, YOU'RE

04:36.442 --> 04:37.577
NOT IN SOME BACCHANALIAN,

04:37.644 --> 04:38.678
BUY-ONE-GET-ONE-FREE ABORTION

04:38.745 --> 04:40.013
PARADISE.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.547
YOU'RE JUST IN WILMINGTON.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.982
I JUST DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BE

04:43.049 --> 04:45.251
DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY VISIT.

04:45.318 --> 04:46.386
BUT ALSO, IT'S NOT ABOUT MERELY

04:46.452 --> 04:46.886
HAVING THE RIGHT TO GO

04:46.953 --> 04:48.521
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

04:48.588 --> 04:49.455
IT'S ABOUT WHETHER YOU HAVE THE

04:49.522 --> 04:50.289
RESOURCES AND ABILITY TO DO

04:50.356 --> 04:52.225
THAT.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.426
AND MANY MAY NOT, WITH THIS

04:53.493 --> 04:54.661
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING

04:54.727 --> 04:56.095
THOSE WITH DISABILITIES, OR WHO

04:56.162 --> 04:56.763
ARE TRANSGENDER, IMMIGRANTS, OR

04:56.829 --> 04:58.464
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.400
AND THE THING IS, EVEN WITH JUST

05:00.466 --> 05:02.001
THE EXISTING LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN

05:02.068 --> 05:03.069
RECENTLY PASSED, ABORTIONS HAD

05:03.136 --> 05:05.471
BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO

05:05.538 --> 05:05.638
GET.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.839
JUST WATCH AS ONE WOMAN

05:06.906 --> 05:08.174
IN TEXAS LEARNED WHAT GETTING AN

05:08.241 --> 05:09.642
ABORTION WOULD ENTAIL FOR HER

05:09.709 --> 05:11.978
AFTER HER STATE PASSED ITS

05:12.045 --> 05:12.679
SO-CALLED "FETAL HEARTBEAT" LAW

05:12.745 --> 05:14.514
LAST YEAR.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.550
>> YOU'RE MEASURING AT 6.1 WEEKS

05:17.617 --> 05:18.384
TODAY, BUT WE DO SEE FETAL

05:18.451 --> 05:21.254
CARDIAC ACTIVITY ON ULTRASOUND.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.189
SO, AS OF SEPTEMBER 1st IN

05:23.256 --> 05:24.557
TEXAS, WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

05:24.624 --> 05:25.491
YOU ARE INELIGIBLE TO HAVE AN

05:25.558 --> 05:26.092
ABORTION IN THE STATE OF TEXAS

05:26.159 --> 05:28.428
RIGHT NOW.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.862
YOUR NEXT OPTIONS WOULD BE

05:29.929 --> 05:30.463
TRAVELING OUT OF STATE TO GET

05:30.530 --> 05:32.231
THE PROCEDURE DONE.

05:32.298 --> 05:33.433
>> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT I WAS

05:33.499 --> 05:35.468
PREGNANT.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.303
I KIND OF JUST TOOK A TEST.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.237
I'M SIX WEEKS AND ONE DAY

05:38.304 --> 05:39.939
PREGNANT.

05:40.006 --> 05:40.807
I'M NOT READY TO HAVE ANOTHER

05:40.873 --> 05:42.208
KID.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.977
I HAVE TWO OTHER LITTLE ONES

05:45.044 --> 05:49.949
THAT I TAKE CARE OF, BY MYSELF.

05:50.016 --> 05:50.550
SO THIS KIND OF WAS VERY

05:50.616 --> 05:52.585
UNEXPECTED.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.821
OTHER FORMS OF BIRTH CONTROL

05:54.887 --> 05:58.357
FAILED ME, AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE

05:58.424 --> 06:01.527
I'M JUMPING THROUGH MORE HOOPS

06:01.594 --> 06:02.095
IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR LIVES

06:02.161 --> 06:03.763
GOING.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.364
>> SIX WEEKS AND A DAY,

06:05.431 --> 06:06.833
AND SHE CAN'T GET AN ABORTION.

06:06.899 --> 06:10.036
FOR MOST PEOPLE, THAT'S A PERIOD

06:10.103 --> 06:11.404
THAT IS TWO WEEKS LATE.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.105
AND YOUR PERIOD COULD BE TWO

06:12.171 --> 06:13.406
WEEKS LATE FOR ANY NUMBER OF

06:13.473 --> 06:19.712
MAYBE YOU'RE TIRED, OR

06:19.779 --> 06:22.381
TRAVELING, OR HAD A CHANGE IN

06:22.448 --> 06:24.984
DIET OR EXERCISE, OR MAYBE

06:25.051 --> 06:27.687
YOU'RE JUST DEALING WITH THE

06:27.754 --> 06:28.387
STRESS OF LIVING IN A

06:28.454 --> 06:29.155
MISOGYNISTIC

06:29.222 --> 06:30.089
THEOCRACY RUN BY FIVE OF THE

06:30.156 --> 06:30.723
BIGGEST WEIRDOS IN THE COUNTRY,

06:30.790 --> 06:31.858
INCLUDING JUSTICE BEER PONG

06:31.924 --> 06:32.492
HERE, AND JUSTICE "MY WIFE

06:32.558 --> 06:33.593
HELPED PLAN A COUP AND ALL I GOT

06:33.659 --> 06:34.560
WAS NO CONSEQUENCES WHATSOEVER."

06:34.627 --> 06:35.461
NOW, IN THAT WOMAN'S

06:35.528 --> 06:36.329
PARTICULAR CASE, SHE WAS ABLE TO

06:36.395 --> 06:37.029
TAKE A LOAN AND DRIVE ALL THE

06:37.096 --> 06:37.697
WAY TO OKLAHOMA TO GET AN

06:37.764 --> 06:40.800
ABORTION.

06:40.867 --> 06:44.203
AND AS AWFUL AS THIS SOUNDS, SHE

06:44.270 --> 06:46.539
WAS ACTUALLY LUCKY, BECAUSE NOW,

06:46.606 --> 06:47.440
THAT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE.

06:47.507 --> 06:48.674
JUST THIS WEEK, OKLAHOMA'S

06:48.741 --> 06:50.009
GOVERNOR SIGNED A TEXAS-STYLE

06:50.076 --> 06:52.945
ABORTION BAN INTO LAW, WHICH IS

06:53.012 --> 06:54.380
NOW OFFICIALLY ONE OF THE WORST

06:54.447 --> 06:55.214
THINGS THAT OKLAHOMA HAS EVER

06:55.281 --> 06:56.349
PRODUCED, AND I'LL REMIND YOU,

06:56.415 --> 06:56.849
IT ALSO GAVE THE WORLD

06:56.916 --> 06:59.385
DR. FUCKING PHIL.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.526
GIVEN THAT HALF OF THOSE WHO

07:06.592 --> 07:08.561
HAVE ABORTIONS ARE BELOW THE

07:08.628 --> 07:12.098
POVERTY LINE, WITH AN ADDITIONAL

07:12.165 --> 07:15.134
1/4 VERY CLOSE TO IT, MANY WILL

07:15.201 --> 07:16.068
BE FACING LIMITED OPTIONS.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.436
ONE ESTIMATE IS THAT, IN THE

07:17.503 --> 07:18.004
YEAR AFTER THE RULING, THERE

07:18.070 --> 07:18.604
WILL BE ROUGHLY 75,000 PEOPLE

07:18.671 --> 07:19.138
WHO WANT, BUT CAN'T GET,

07:19.205 --> 07:19.906
ABORTIONS, AND WILL GIVE BIRTH

07:19.972 --> 07:20.940
INSTEAD.

07:21.007 --> 07:21.908
AND INEVITABLY, SOME OF THOSE

07:21.974 --> 07:22.708
PEOPLE WILL DIE, BECAUSE

07:22.775 --> 07:23.810
PREGNANCY IS A MAJOR MEDICAL

07:23.876 --> 07:24.610
EVENT.

07:24.677 --> 07:25.478
ALREADY, THOSE LIVING IN STATES

07:25.545 --> 07:26.412
WITH THE MOST RESTRICTIVE

07:26.479 --> 07:27.713
ABORTION POLICIES -- AND THUS

07:27.780 --> 07:28.648
THE LEAST ACCESS TO THEM -- WERE

07:28.714 --> 07:29.749
FOUND TO BE MORE LIKELY TO DIE

07:29.816 --> 07:30.383
WHILE PREGNANT OR SHORTLY

07:30.449 --> 07:32.018
THEREAFTER.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.019
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS ALL

07:33.085 --> 07:34.754
EXTREMELY GRIM.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.857
BUT IT IS NOW WORTH TAKING A

07:37.924 --> 07:38.491
MOMENT ON EXACTLY HOW WE GOT TO

07:38.558 --> 07:39.826
THIS POINT, ESPECIALLY AS SOME

07:39.892 --> 07:41.160
HAVE BEEN TELLING A SLIGHTLY

07:41.227 --> 07:43.029
INCOMPLETE STORY THIS WEEK.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.497
JUST LISTEN TO CHUCK SCHUMER,

07:44.564 --> 07:45.531
POINTING THE FINGER OF BLAME

07:45.598 --> 07:47.266
FIRMLY IN ONE DIRECTION.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.168
>> THIS ISN'T YOUR GRANDFATHER'S

07:49.235 --> 07:50.903
REPUBLICAN PARTY, AMERICA.

07:50.970 --> 07:51.838
IT'S DONALD TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN

07:51.904 --> 07:53.005
PARTY.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.707
>> WELL, HOLD ON THERE.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.209
BECAUSE IN WHAT WAY IS THIS NOT

07:56.275 --> 07:56.809
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S REPUBLICAN

07:56.876 --> 07:58.744
PARTY?

07:58.811 --> 08:00.012
IT HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR

08:00.079 --> 08:01.113
THIS EXACT OUTCOME FOR DECADES

08:01.180 --> 08:03.049
NOW.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.417
IN FACT, I WOULD BE WILLING TO

08:04.483 --> 08:05.651
BET THAT IF YOUR GRANDFATHER

08:05.718 --> 08:06.752
DIED IN THE '70s, CAME BACK TO

08:06.819 --> 08:08.487
LIFE RIGHT NOW, AND SCANNED THE

08:08.554 --> 08:10.456
NEWS, THE FIRST THING HE'D SAY

08:10.523 --> 08:11.524
IS THAT THE CURRENT REPUBLICAN

08:11.591 --> 08:12.258
PARTY SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE THE

08:12.325 --> 08:15.628
ONE HE REMEMBERS.

08:16.929 --> 08:17.830
ACTUALLY, THE FIRST THING

08:17.897 --> 08:20.199
HE'D SAY IS, "WHO'S ELON MUSK?"

08:20.933 --> 08:21.701
TO WHICH YOU'D SAY, "HE'S A RICH

08:21.767 --> 08:22.368
ASSHOLE WHO WANTS TO OWN

08:22.435 --> 08:23.069
TWITTER."

08:23.135 --> 08:25.104
TO WHICH HE'D SAY, "WHAT'S

08:25.171 --> 08:25.371
TWITTER?"

08:25.438 --> 08:26.305
AND YOU'D SAY, "IT'S BASICALLY A

08:26.372 --> 08:26.839
MASSIVE PUBLIC TOILET THAT

08:26.906 --> 08:28.374
PEOPLE SHIT THEIR BAD OPINIONS

08:28.441 --> 08:30.843
INTO ALL DAY LONG, BUT AT

08:30.910 --> 08:31.611
LEAST CHER IS ON THERE TOO!"

08:31.677 --> 08:32.445
TO WHICH HE'D REPLY, "YOU MEAN

08:32.511 --> 08:33.479
SONNY'S WIFE?"

08:33.546 --> 08:34.447
AND YOU'D SAY, "YEAH" BECAUSE

08:34.513 --> 08:35.748
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO FILL HIM

08:35.815 --> 08:36.682
IN ON THE DIVORCE, MUCH LESS THE

08:36.749 --> 08:37.817
ACCIDENT, TO WHICH HE'D SAY,

08:37.884 --> 08:39.218
"HOW'S SONNY DOING, BY THE WAY?"

08:39.285 --> 08:43.155
TO WHICH YOU'D SAY, "OH, HE'S

08:43.222 --> 08:44.056
GREAT, HE'S VERY HEALTHY!"

08:44.123 --> 08:45.758
TO WHICH HE'D REPLY, "DOES HE

08:45.825 --> 08:46.292
STILL HAVE THE MUSTACHE?"

08:46.359 --> 08:47.093
AND YOU'D SAY, "OH, YOU BETCHA!"

08:47.159 --> 08:47.960
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT, YOU'RE

08:48.027 --> 08:48.861
WAY TOO DEEP INTO THE LIE TO

08:48.928 --> 08:50.062
ADMIT TO YOUR RESURRECTED

08:50.129 --> 08:50.863
GRANDPA THAT SONNY BONO DIED BY

08:50.930 --> 08:54.567
SKIING INTO A TREE.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.501
BUT THEN, AFTER ALL THAT, HE'D

08:55.568 --> 08:56.402
DEFINITELY LOOK AT YOU AND SAY

08:56.469 --> 08:57.703
THAT THE CURRENT REPUBLICAN

08:57.770 --> 09:00.673
PARTY SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE THE

09:00.740 --> 09:03.976
ONE THAT HE REMEMBERS.

09:04.577 --> 09:05.811
BECAUSE IT DOES.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.412
THIS IS JUST NOT A RECENT

09:06.479 --> 09:07.380
DEVELOPMENT AT ALL.

09:07.446 --> 09:08.848
BECAUSE WHILE, YES, TRUMP DID

09:08.915 --> 09:09.815
PICK 1/3 OF THIS COURT,

09:09.882 --> 09:10.549
INCLUDING A SEAT FOR GORSUCH

09:10.616 --> 09:11.918
THAT WAS STOLEN FOR HIM, THAT

09:11.984 --> 09:13.152
WAS THE RESULT OF DECADES OF

09:13.219 --> 09:15.121
WORK BY ANTIABORTION FORCES.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.656
LONG BEFORE TRUMP EVER EVEN

09:16.722 --> 09:18.124
CONSIDERED RUNNING FOR OFFICE,

09:18.190 --> 09:19.425
CONSERVATIVES WERE OPENLY

09:19.492 --> 09:20.393
ANNOUNCING THEIR INTENTION TO

09:20.459 --> 09:22.862
OVERTURN ROE.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.263
IN FACT, THE VERY DAY THE ROE

09:24.330 --> 09:25.164
DECISION WAS HANDED DOWN, THE

09:25.231 --> 09:25.932
STRATEGIZING AGAINST IT HAD

09:25.998 --> 09:28.134
ALREADY BEGUN.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.802
JUST WATCH THIS NEWS REPORT FROM

09:29.869 --> 09:30.736
THAT DAY, FEATURING A LAWYER

09:30.803 --> 09:32.438
TALKING ABOUT A LAWSUIT HE WAS

09:32.505 --> 09:33.306
SUPPORTING THAT COULD OVERTURN

09:33.372 --> 09:35.107
ROE.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.943
>> WHAT ABOUT THE CHILD'S RIGHT?

09:37.009 --> 09:37.610
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

09:37.677 --> 09:38.711
THE WOMAN'S RIGHT, YOU'RE

09:38.778 --> 09:39.712
TALKING ABOUT 1/3 OF THE

09:39.779 --> 09:41.814
RIGHTS INVOLVED.

09:41.881 --> 09:42.748
THE MOTHER, THE FATHER, AND

09:42.815 --> 09:44.483
THE CHILD.

09:44.550 --> 09:45.718
SOMEBODY'S MORALITY, OR LACK

09:45.785 --> 09:47.453
OF IT, IS CERTAINLY IMPOSED UPON

09:47.520 --> 09:48.321
THE UNBORN CHILDREN WHO ARE

09:48.387 --> 09:49.755
KILLED.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.058
>> WOW.

09:52.124 --> 09:52.758
WOMEN HAVE 1/3 OF THE RIGHTS

09:52.825 --> 09:58.731
INVOLVED.

09:58.798 --> 09:59.365
HONESTLY, THAT IS KIND OF

09:59.432 --> 10:00.399
PERFECT.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.669
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING WE

10:03.736 --> 10:04.804
LOVE TO DO IN AMERICA, IT'S TURN

10:04.870 --> 10:05.638
EVERYONE WHO ISN'T A STRAIGHT

10:05.705 --> 10:06.372
WHITE MAN INTO A FUCKING

10:06.439 --> 10:09.208
FRACTION.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.476
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT TRULY IS

10:10.543 --> 10:11.110
"DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE NATION'S

10:11.177 --> 10:12.778
HISTORY AND TRADITIONS."

10:12.845 --> 10:13.646
BUT ARGUMENTS LIKE THAT ARE WHY

10:13.713 --> 10:14.513
SOME DEMOCRATS, LIKE

10:14.580 --> 10:15.648
REPRESENTATIVE BELLA ABZUG,

10:15.715 --> 10:16.449
ARGUED IN THE WAKE OF THE ROE

10:16.515 --> 10:17.516
DECISION THAT CONGRESS STILL

10:17.583 --> 10:18.184
NEEDED TO QUICKLY PASS

10:18.250 --> 10:19.085
LEGISLATION CODIFYING THE RIGHT

10:19.151 --> 10:20.152
TO AN ABORTION.

10:20.219 --> 10:21.020
AND SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

10:21.087 --> 10:21.654
BUT, OF COURSE, THEY DIDN'T DO

10:21.721 --> 10:23.255
THAT.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.825
NOR DID THEY DO IT AS THE

10:25.891 --> 10:26.625
ANTIABORTION MOVEMENT KICKED

10:26.692 --> 10:27.927
INTO HIGH GEAR IN THE LATE

10:27.994 --> 10:28.527
1970s, WITH THE SUPPORT OF

10:28.594 --> 10:29.695
EVANGELICAL LEADERS LIKE

10:29.762 --> 10:31.430
JERRY FALWELL, WHO HELPED

10:31.497 --> 10:32.732
ELEVATE THE ABORTION ISSUE AS A

10:32.798 --> 10:33.833
WAY OF MOTIVATING CONSERVATIVE

10:33.899 --> 10:35.201
VOTERS TO THE POLLS.

10:35.267 --> 10:36.869
THEY DIDN'T EVEN DO IT AS

10:36.936 --> 10:40.906
ANTIABORTION LEGISLATORS MANAGED

10:40.973 --> 10:42.008
TO PASS A THOUSAND RESTRICTIONS

10:42.074 --> 10:44.010
INTO LAW AT THE STATE LEVEL.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.845
ALL THAT TIME, TOO MANY

10:45.911 --> 10:47.313
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SHIED AWAY

10:47.380 --> 10:48.748
FROM ENGAGING IN THAT FIGHT, OR

10:48.814 --> 10:49.582
WERE SQUEAMISH IN THEIR DEFENSE

10:49.648 --> 10:51.083
OF ABORTION.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.252
BILL CLINTON, FOR INSTANCE,

10:53.319 --> 10:55.621
ARGUED THAT IT SHOULD BE "SAFE,

10:55.688 --> 10:57.256
LEGAL AND RARE," WHICH CAST

10:57.323 --> 10:58.491
ABORTION AS A REGRETTABLY

10:58.557 --> 10:59.558
NECESSARY EVIL, NOT A

10:59.625 --> 11:00.659
CORNERSTONE OF COMPREHENSIVE

11:00.726 --> 11:02.395
HEALTH CARE.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.562
AND WHILE LATER, BARACK OBAMA

11:03.629 --> 11:05.131
CAMPAIGNED ON PASSING

11:05.197 --> 11:06.665
THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE ACT,

11:06.732 --> 11:08.634
ENSHRINING THE RIGHT TO ABORTION

11:08.701 --> 11:10.369
INTO LAW, WHEN HE WAS REMINDED

11:10.436 --> 11:11.971
OF THAT PROMISE A HUNDRED DAYS

11:12.038 --> 11:13.205
INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, HE WASTED

11:13.272 --> 11:14.073
NO TIME DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM

11:14.140 --> 11:15.808
IT.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.243
>> THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE ACT IS

11:17.309 --> 11:18.077
NOT MY HIGHEST LEGISLATIVE

11:18.144 --> 11:21.781
PRIORITY.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.548
I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE

11:22.615 --> 11:25.484
THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.154
BUT I THINK THAT THE MOST

11:28.220 --> 11:30.523
IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO

11:30.589 --> 11:37.296
TO TAMP DOWN SOME OF THE ANGER

11:37.363 --> 11:38.798
SURROUNDING THIS ISSUE IS TO

11:38.864 --> 11:39.632
FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS THAT WE CAN

11:39.698 --> 11:44.303
AGREE ON.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.205
>> OKAY, EXCEPT THAT'S

11:46.272 --> 11:46.906
JUST RIDICULOUS.

11:46.972 --> 11:48.207
PARTLY BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING

11:48.274 --> 11:49.075
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO AGREE

11:49.141 --> 11:49.975
ON.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.110
POLLS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THAT

11:51.177 --> 11:51.811
AROUND 2/3 OF AMERICANS SUPPORT

11:51.877 --> 11:53.079
THE ROE V. WADE DECISION.

11:53.145 --> 11:55.181
2/3!

11:55.247 --> 11:56.582
PRESIDENTS CAN'T EVEN GET AN

11:56.649 --> 11:57.283
APPROVAL RATING THAT HIGH,

11:57.349 --> 11:57.917
UNLESS THERE ARE, LIKE, TWO

11:57.983 --> 12:01.554
9-11s.

12:02.555 --> 12:06.559
IT'S CALLED AN 18-22, AND IF

12:06.625 --> 12:08.627
WE'RE HONEST, IT MIGHT ACTUALLY

12:08.694 --> 12:09.495
BE COMING.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.563
AND THAT'S SADLY BEEN EMBLEMATIC

12:10.629 --> 12:11.464
OF DEMOCRATS' APPROACH, OFFERING

12:11.530 --> 12:13.332
VAGUE STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT,

12:13.399 --> 12:13.933
WHILE ABORTION'S BEEN

12:13.999 --> 12:15.067
SPECIFICALLY UNDER ATTACK.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.168
AND ALL THE WHILE, REPUBLICANS

12:16.235 --> 12:16.902
HAVE FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE WITH

12:16.969 --> 12:22.108
RELENTLESS DETERMINATION.

12:22.174 --> 12:22.675
HERE'S JERRY FALWELL, RIGHT

12:22.741 --> 12:24.009
AFTER ALITO WAS APPOINTED TO THE

12:24.076 --> 12:24.743
COURT, TAKING A VICTORY LAP

12:24.810 --> 12:25.344
FOLLOWING A RULING THAT UPHELD

12:25.411 --> 12:26.312
THE BAN ON A SPECIFIC ABORTION

12:26.378 --> 12:27.646
PROCEDURE.

12:27.713 --> 12:29.315
>> THAT IS THE CULMINATION, FOR

12:29.381 --> 12:30.883
ME, OF ABOUT 35 YEARS OF WORK.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.384
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE FIVE VOTES

12:32.451 --> 12:35.621
ON ROE V. WADE.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.255
I THINK WE ARE PROBABLY ONE OR

12:36.322 --> 12:38.057
TWO VOTES SHORT.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.259
>> AS WE TALKED THAT LAST WEEK

12:40.326 --> 12:41.861
OF HIS LIFE, FALWELL SEEMED TO

12:41.927 --> 12:44.263
RECOGNIZE THAT HIS BATTLE TO END

12:44.330 --> 12:45.531
ALL ABORTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE

12:45.598 --> 12:46.665
WON BY THE NEXT GENERATION OF

12:46.732 --> 12:49.368
GOD'S WARRIORS.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.538
>> MY CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY

12:52.605 --> 12:53.439
TO SEE THIS VICTORY WON THAN I

12:53.506 --> 12:54.707
AM.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.576
I THINK WE'RE 50 YEARS AWAY.

12:57.643 --> 12:58.677
WE'VE GOT TO JUST STAY WITH IT,

12:58.744 --> 13:00.112
STAY WITH IT, STAY WITH IT AND

13:00.179 --> 13:02.915
NEVER GIVE UP.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.950
>> WOW, EVEN THE TRULY

13:05.017 --> 13:06.485
MAGNIFICENT SIGHT OF JERRY

13:06.552 --> 13:11.090
FALWELL IN A COFFIN SOMEHOW

13:11.157 --> 13:12.324
STILL DOESN'T MAKE THAT GO DOWN

13:12.391 --> 13:14.126
ANY EASIER.

13:14.193 --> 13:14.693
BECAUSE FALWELL WAS ACTUALLY

13:14.760 --> 13:15.327
PESSIMISTIC IN HIS PREDICTION

13:15.394 --> 13:16.095
THERE.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.730
THEY ACHIEVED THAT VICTORY

13:17.796 --> 13:18.330
35 YEARS AHEAD OF HIS 50-YEAR

13:18.397 --> 13:19.665
SCHEDULE.

13:19.732 --> 13:20.599
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE ONLY

13:20.666 --> 13:22.368
THING HE WAS WRONG ABOUT IN THAT

13:22.434 --> 13:25.070
INTERVIEW, BECAUSE HE ALSO SAID

13:25.137 --> 13:26.272
HE'D BEEN PRAYING FOR ANOTHER

13:26.338 --> 13:26.906
20 YEARS OF LIFE, DESPITE ONLY

13:26.972 --> 13:28.307
HAVING ABOUT ONE WEEK OF IT

13:28.374 --> 13:29.375
LEFT.

13:29.441 --> 13:30.409
SO I GUESS AT THE VERY LEAST WE

13:30.476 --> 13:31.377
NOW KNOW GOD DIDN'T WANT TO

13:31.443 --> 13:35.181
LISTEN TO ANY MORE OF JERRY

13:35.247 --> 13:37.149
FALWELL'S BULLSHIT EITHER.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.284
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW,

13:38.350 --> 13:38.884
CONSERVATIVES AREN'T REMOTELY

13:38.951 --> 13:39.652
DONE HERE.

13:39.718 --> 13:42.154
THEY'VE ALREADY EMBARKED ON THE

13:42.221 --> 13:43.155
NEXT FIGHT, WITH LOUISIANA

13:43.222 --> 13:44.323
JUST THIS WEEK ADVANCING

13:44.390 --> 13:46.825
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW

13:46.892 --> 13:47.993
PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE THOSE WHO

13:48.060 --> 13:49.028
GET ABORTIONS, OR PROVIDE THEM,

13:49.094 --> 13:50.329
WITH HOMICIDE.

13:50.396 --> 13:51.964
THAT BILL, LIKE ANTIABORTION

13:52.031 --> 13:53.365
LEGISLATION IN SEVERAL OTHER

13:53.432 --> 13:54.733
STATES, EVEN DEFINES PERSONHOOD

13:54.800 --> 13:56.502
AS BEGINNING FROM THE MOMENT OF

13:56.569 --> 13:58.137
FERTILIZATION, WHICH WOULD

13:58.204 --> 14:00.105
ARGUABLY CRIMINALIZE IN VITRO

14:00.172 --> 14:00.739
FERTILIZATION AND FORMS OF BIRTH

14:00.806 --> 14:03.108
CONTROL.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.877
AND ALL THIS IS HAPPENING, EVEN

14:04.944 --> 14:05.844
AS OTHER COUNTRIES ARE EXPANDING

14:05.911 --> 14:08.113
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.348
EVEN IRELAND IS NOW MORE

14:09.415 --> 14:10.883
PROGRESSIVE ON ABORTION THAN

14:10.950 --> 14:12.618
SOME U.S. STATES.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.520
AND IF YOU'RE NOT UP ON YOUR

14:14.587 --> 14:15.487
IRISH HISTORY, THAT WAS NOT

14:15.554 --> 14:17.790
ALWAYS THE CASE!

14:18.991 --> 14:20.559
AND THAT'S AS MUCH AS I'LL WEIGH

14:20.626 --> 14:21.594
IN ON IRISH HISTORY -- BECAUSE I

14:21.660 --> 14:24.296
SOUND LIKE THIS.

14:25.664 --> 14:26.932
AND IT'S NOT JUST THEM.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.200
OTHER PREDOMINANTLY CATHOLIC

14:28.267 --> 14:29.535
COUNTRIES, LIKE ARGENTINA,

14:29.602 --> 14:30.502
MEXICO AND COLOMBIA HAVE ALSO

14:30.569 --> 14:31.136
SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED ABORTION

14:31.203 --> 14:33.005
RIGHTS.

14:33.072 --> 14:37.876
JUST TWO MONTHS AGO, COLOMBIA

14:37.943 --> 14:38.510
WON A MASSIVE COURT VICTORY, TO

14:38.577 --> 14:42.181
HUGE CELEBRATIONS.

14:42.248 --> 14:42.948
>> THIS IS HISTORIC.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.750
IT BRINGS US SUCH HAPPINESS.

14:44.817 --> 14:45.618
BECAUSE LITTLE BY LITTLE WE ARE

14:45.684 --> 14:47.953
CHANGING OUR HISTORY.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.688
WE FINALLY SUCCEEDED IN HAVING

14:49.755 --> 14:50.322
THEM ALLOW US TO DECIDE OVER OUR

14:50.389 --> 14:52.191
BODIES.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.493
WE FOUGHT FOR THIS FOR MANY

14:54.560 --> 14:56.262
YEARS, AND CLANDESTINE ABORTIONS

14:56.328 --> 15:00.766
TOOK THE LIVES OF SO MANY WOMEN.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.534
>> THAT IS TRULY

15:02.601 --> 15:03.769
INSPIRING, QUICK SHOUT

15:03.836 --> 15:05.871
OUT TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE A

15:05.938 --> 15:06.438
CROCHETED SKI MASK WITH THE

15:06.505 --> 15:08.741
LETTERS "ACAB."

15:09.742 --> 15:10.542
LET THIS BE A LESSON THAT YOU

15:10.609 --> 15:11.543
ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT TO FUCK

15:11.610 --> 15:12.611
WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS THE

15:12.678 --> 15:14.246
PATIENCE, ATTENTION TO DETAIL,

15:14.313 --> 15:16.915
AND SUSTAINED ANGER TO CROTCHET

15:16.982 --> 15:17.750
THEIR RESENTMENT INTO A

15:17.816 --> 15:20.886
HAND-MADE GARMENT.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.055
THAT IS STAMINA.

15:23.122 --> 15:23.889
THAT IS SOMEONE IN THE FIGHT FOR

15:23.956 --> 15:26.525
THE LONG HAUL.

15:27.893 --> 15:28.727
SO CLEARLY, WE IN THE STATES

15:28.794 --> 15:29.662
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO RIGHT

15:29.728 --> 15:30.629
NOW, BOTH IN THE SHORT AND THE

15:30.696 --> 15:34.433
LONGTERM.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.434
AND LET ME START WITH THOSE IN

15:36.535 --> 15:44.443
PEOPLE WHO NEED AN ABORTION IN

15:44.510 --> 15:46.011
STATES WHERE BANDS ARE ABOUT TO

15:46.078 --> 15:46.345
BE IN EFFECT.

15:46.412 --> 15:46.979
YOU STILL HAVE OPTIONS AVAILABLE

15:47.046 --> 15:48.080
TO YOU, AND ONE GOOD WAY TO FIND

15:48.147 --> 15:48.914
OUT WHAT THEY ARE IS TO GO TO

15:48.981 --> 15:50.282
THE WEBSITE INeedAnA.com.

15:50.349 --> 15:50.883
IT HAS LOTS OF INFO, INCLUDING

15:50.949 --> 15:52.518
WHAT'S PERMITTED WHERE YOU LIVE,

15:52.584 --> 15:53.118
AND WHERE YOU CAN FIND CLINICS

15:53.185 --> 15:53.686
AND APPROPRIATE RESOURCES.

15:53.752 --> 15:54.453
AND IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING

15:54.520 --> 15:55.020
FINANCIALLY, ONE OF THOSE

15:55.087 --> 15:55.854
RESOURCES MIGHT BE AN ABORTION

15:55.921 --> 15:56.655
FUND, WHICH CAN HELP COVER YOUR

15:56.722 --> 15:57.389
EXPENSES.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.390
IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS OR SUPPORT

15:58.457 --> 15:59.425
THOSE FUNDS, THERE ARE LOTS OUT

15:59.491 --> 16:01.026
THERE, LIKE THE BRIGID ALLIANCE,

16:01.093 --> 16:01.760
WHICH HELPS ABORTION PATIENTS

16:01.827 --> 16:02.995
WHO ARE TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES

16:03.062 --> 16:04.797
TO REACH THEIR APPOINTMENTS, AND

16:04.863 --> 16:06.065
THE LILITH AND YELLOWHAMMER

16:06.131 --> 16:07.266
FUNDS, BOTH OF WHICH HELP WOMEN

16:07.333 --> 16:08.000
ON THE GROUND IN IMPACTED

16:08.067 --> 16:10.569
STATES.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.937
BUT THESE ARE CLEARLY JUST

16:12.004 --> 16:12.705
STOPGAP SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH

16:12.771 --> 16:15.240
AN IMMEDIATE CRISIS.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.809
LONGTERM, WE NEED ELECTED

16:16.875 --> 16:17.910
OFFICIALS TO STOP TIPTOEING

16:17.976 --> 16:18.977
AROUND THE ISSUE OF ABORTION AND

16:19.044 --> 16:19.611
TAKE STEPS TO PROPERLY SAFEGUARD

16:19.678 --> 16:25.017
IT.

16:25.084 --> 16:25.951
THE DREAM VERSION OF THIS WOULD

16:26.018 --> 16:26.819
BE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT

16:26.885 --> 16:28.120
THAT'D SUPPORT PEOPLE'S

16:28.187 --> 16:28.687
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO MAKE

16:28.754 --> 16:29.855
PERSONAL DECISIONS ABOUT

16:29.922 --> 16:30.389
CONTRACEPTION, PREGNANCY,

16:30.456 --> 16:32.224
MARRIAGE, AND FAMILY LIFE.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.158
BUT UNTIL THEN, WE ARE GOING TO

16:33.225 --> 16:34.259
NEED OTHER LEGISLATION AT THE

16:34.326 --> 16:36.095
STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.262
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT, WE MAY

16:37.329 --> 16:39.198
NOW ALSO NEED TO SHORE UP ALL

16:39.264 --> 16:40.499
THE OTHER RIGHTS SUPPOSEDLY

16:40.566 --> 16:41.700
GUARANTEED BY SUPREME COURT

16:41.767 --> 16:43.035
RULINGS -- FROM VOTING RIGHTS TO

16:43.102 --> 16:44.636
GAY MARRIAGE -- BECAUSE THE FACT

16:44.703 --> 16:46.138
IS, UNDER THE CURRENT SUPREME

16:46.205 --> 16:48.140
COURT, YOUR BASIC RIGHTS TODAY

16:48.207 --> 16:50.409
COULD BECOME CRIMES TOMORROW.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.010
AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME

16:52.077 --> 16:56.148
SMALL OPPORTUNITIES ON THE

16:56.215 --> 16:57.716
HORIZON FOR YOU.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.017
IN AT LEAST THESE FOUR STATES,

16:59.084 --> 16:59.918
ABORTION IS GOING TO BE ON THE

16:59.985 --> 17:01.019
BALLOT THIS YEAR.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.154
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'D PROBABLY

17:02.221 --> 17:03.455
RATHER EAT SHARDS OF GLASS THAN

17:03.522 --> 17:05.457
BE TOLD TO VOTE ONE MORE TIME.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.291
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE BEEN

17:08.327 --> 17:09.928
SHOWING UP TO THE POLLS, AND

17:09.995 --> 17:10.763
HOLDING YOUR NOSE TO VOTE FOR A

17:10.829 --> 17:12.531
CANDIDATE YOU MAY NOT EVEN LIKE,

17:12.598 --> 17:17.302
WHILE ENDURING THOUSANDS OF

17:17.369 --> 17:18.137
TEXTS SCREAMING, "IT IS THE MOST

17:18.203 --> 17:19.037
IMPORTANT ELECTION OF YOUR

17:19.104 --> 17:19.705
LIFETIME, DONATE $20 TO THE DNC

17:19.772 --> 17:20.472
RIGHT NOW."

17:20.539 --> 17:22.174
AND YOU DIDN'T TEXT

17:22.241 --> 17:25.511
"STOP 2 QUIT" ONCE, NO MATTER

17:25.577 --> 17:28.947
HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO,

17:29.014 --> 17:30.783
AND HE WANTED TO THROW YOUR

17:30.849 --> 17:35.187
PHONE IN THE FUCKING RIVER.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.522
AND I ALSO GET WHY "JUST VOTE"

17:36.588 --> 17:37.222
IS AN INFURIATINGLY INSUFFICIENT

17:37.289 --> 17:37.823
SLOGAN, WHEN VOTING RIGHTS

17:37.890 --> 17:38.490
THEMSELVES ARE UNDER SIEGE.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.558
I CANNOT DEFEND THE SYSTEM WE

17:39.625 --> 17:40.092
CURRENTLY HAVE.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.093
BUT IT IS, UNFORTUNATELY, THE

17:41.160 --> 17:43.095
ONE WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW.

17:43.162 --> 17:43.929
SO ELECTORAL VICTORIES ARE GOING

17:43.996 --> 17:46.432
TO BE CRITICAL HERE.

17:46.498 --> 17:47.733
BUT THEY ALSO MUST BE FOLLOWED

17:47.800 --> 17:48.400
BY CONCRETE ACTIONS BY THOSE WE

17:48.467 --> 17:50.269
ELECT.

17:50.335 --> 17:52.304
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS, IF NOTHING

17:52.371 --> 17:54.406
ELSE, JUST GRIMLY DEMONSTRATED

17:54.473 --> 17:54.940
WHAT COMMITTED ACTION CAN

17:55.007 --> 18:01.313
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.014
THEY NEVER ACCEPTED ROE V WADE

18:02.080 --> 18:03.015
AS FINAL.

18:03.081 --> 18:03.615
THEY PLAYED THE LONG GAME, AND

18:03.682 --> 18:06.852
NOT ALWAYS FAIRLY.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.120
BUT THEY RALLIED THEIR BASE AND

18:08.187 --> 18:08.720
RELENTLESSLY HELD THEIR PARTY

18:08.787 --> 18:13.358
LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE, WHETHER

18:13.425 --> 18:14.426
THEY LIKED THOSE LEADERS OR NOT.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.327
AND THEN, CRUCIALLY, THOSE

18:15.394 --> 18:16.161
LEADERS DELIVERED FOR THEM --

18:16.228 --> 18:17.529
BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT

18:17.596 --> 18:18.363
VOTING IS ONLY MEANINGFUL IF THE

18:18.430 --> 18:20.999
PEOPLE WHO WIN ACTUALLY DO WHAT

18:21.066 --> 18:22.768
THEY FUCKING PROMISE YOU!

18:22.835 --> 18:23.836
ANTI-CHOICE ADVOCATES WORKED

18:23.902 --> 18:28.407
REALLY HARD, FOR A REALLY LONG

18:28.474 --> 18:29.274
TIME, TO ENSURE ROE WOULD NOT BE

18:29.341 --> 18:30.375
PERMANENT.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.109
BUT THE THING IS, ITS UNDOING

18:31.176 --> 18:32.110
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE, EITHER.

18:32.177 --> 18:32.811
THIS WEEK, WE'VE ALL BEEN

18:32.878 --> 18:33.712
REMINDED OF WHAT THE MOST

18:33.779 --> 18:34.480
MARGINALIZED PEOPLE IN THIS

18:36.315 --> 18:37.616
THAT FREEDOMS ARE NEVER

18:37.683 --> 18:40.619
GUARANTEED -- THEY ARE HARD-WON

18:40.686 --> 18:42.488
AND THEY ARE EASILY LOST.

18:42.554 --> 18:43.755
PROGRESS REQUIRES A CONSISTENT,

18:43.822 --> 18:45.491
SUSTAINED STRUGGLE, A

18:45.557 --> 18:46.825
WILLINGNESS TO DISRUPT EVERYDAY

18:46.892 --> 18:52.698
LIFE, AND ACTUAL COURAGE FROM

18:52.764 --> 18:53.565
THE PEOPLE THAT WE CHOOSE TO

18:53.632 --> 18:57.536
LEAD US.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.538
IN SHORT, WE ALL BADLY NEED TO

18:59.605 --> 19:00.572
HAVE THE SAME ANGER AND THE SAME

19:00.639 --> 19:01.273
WILLINGNESS FOR A LONG-HAUL

19:01.340 --> 19:02.007
FIGHT AS THE WORLD'S MOST

19:02.074 --> 19:02.641
HARDCORE KNITTER.

19:02.708 --> 19:08.647
AND NOW THIS.

19:08.714 --> 19:12.117
>> AND NOW, LOCAL NEWS SHOWS GO

19:12.184 --> 19:12.751
THROUGH THE MOTIONS FOR

19:12.818 --> 19:14.686
"STAR WARS" DAY.

19:14.753 --> 19:19.758
>> WEDNESDAY, SAY IT WITH ME.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.461
DID YOU?

19:22.528 --> 19:22.694
>> OKAY.

19:22.761 --> 19:25.797
>> NOW SAY IT WITH ME.

19:25.864 --> 19:29.535
MAY THE 4th BE WITH YOU.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.603
>> TODAY IS A CELEBRATION FOR

19:31.670 --> 19:32.771
ALL THE "STAR WARS" FANS.

19:32.838 --> 19:39.545
IT IS MAY THE FOURTH.

19:39.611 --> 19:40.212
WE KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE TODAY.

19:40.279 --> 19:40.779
TO SPEAK LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.381
>> I DON'T LIKE HOW THEY TOOK

19:42.447 --> 19:44.616
THIS DAY,

19:44.683 --> 19:47.419
MAY THE 4th BE WITH YOU.

19:47.486 --> 19:50.389
I GET IT.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.190
>> DOES THAT DO ANYTHING BETTER

19:52.257 --> 19:55.427
FOR YOU?

19:55.494 --> 19:58.063
>> HIT THE BUTTON.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.232
>> ANYWAY, SHOULD I BE ATTACKING

20:00.299 --> 20:01.967
THESE TWO FROM THE OTHER GALAXY?

20:02.034 --> 20:05.103
ARE THEY GOOD GUYS?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.506
>> HARRISON FORD PLAYED --

20:07.573 --> 20:11.143
>> HAN SOLO.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.045
>> THAT IS THE GUY, HE IS THE

20:13.111 --> 20:15.080
SPACESHIP.

20:15.147 --> 20:15.714
>> SO COOL.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.383
>> AND HE GOT ALL THE WOMEN.

20:18.450 --> 20:18.750
>> THERE YOU GO.

20:21.019 --> 20:21.787
>> MOVING ON.

20:21.853 --> 20:22.688
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

20:22.754 --> 20:23.855
THE PHILIPPINES.

20:23.922 --> 20:24.957
THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE US, AMONG

20:25.023 --> 20:25.824
OTHER THINGS, BRUNO MARS,

20:25.891 --> 20:26.792
OLIVIA RODRIGO, AND JOLLIBEE,

20:26.858 --> 20:27.526
THE GREATEST FAST FOOD MASCOT OF

20:27.593 --> 20:29.761
ALL TIME.

20:29.828 --> 20:30.395
HE'S A 6'5" BEE IN A TUXEDO TOP

20:30.462 --> 20:30.963
THAT JUST WANTS TO SERVE YOU

20:31.029 --> 20:32.364
FRIED CHICKEN AND SPAGHETTI.

20:32.431 --> 20:38.370
WHAT DO WE HAVE THAT COMPARES?

20:38.437 --> 20:40.238
TERRIFYINGLY LARGE CHILD,

20:40.305 --> 20:41.406
HAMBURGER JOKER.

20:41.473 --> 20:44.343
HELLO-MISTER-POLICE-I-GAVE-YOU-

20:44.409 --> 20:45.410
ALL-THE-CLUES?

20:45.477 --> 20:46.178
PLEASE.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.045
THE WINNER HERE IS CLEAR.

20:47.112 --> 20:47.813
WE'VE DISCUSSED THE PHILIPPINES

20:47.879 --> 20:49.348
ON THE SHOW BEFORE, MOSTLY

20:49.414 --> 20:49.948
THANKS TO THEIR CURRENT LEADER

20:50.015 --> 20:50.549
AND SELF-PROCLAIMED DICTATOR

20:50.616 --> 20:51.149
RODRIGO DUTERTE, WHO HAS, IF

20:51.216 --> 20:56.288
NOTHING ELSE, A WAY WITH WORDS.

20:56.355 --> 21:02.728
>> WHY DO YOU HAVE TO, YOU KNOW,

21:02.794 --> 21:04.730
FUCK WITH US, GODDAMNIT?

21:04.796 --> 21:05.364
>> ONCE AGAIN, I REPEAT IT,

21:05.430 --> 21:08.567
FUCK YOU.

21:10.068 --> 21:13.071
>> WOW.

21:13.138 --> 21:14.306
I KNOW THAT A STRIKING AMOUNT OF

21:14.373 --> 21:15.574
SWEARING, BUT YOU ALSO CAN'T

21:15.641 --> 21:16.875
UNDERSTATE HOW BRAZEN IT IS FOR

21:16.942 --> 21:17.743
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

21:17.809 --> 21:18.377
PHILIPPINES, A NATION OVER 80%

21:18.443 --> 21:19.711
CATHOLIC, TO CALL THE POPE

21:19.778 --> 21:22.114
"A SON OF A WHORE."

21:23.482 --> 21:25.117
THAT IS A BIG DEAL.

21:25.183 --> 21:25.717
IMAGINE IF JOE BIDEN PUBLICLY

21:25.784 --> 21:26.284
TOLD DOLLY PARTON TO GO FUCK

21:26.351 --> 21:27.386
HERSELF.

21:27.452 --> 21:34.493
FORGET BACKLASH, HE'D BE DRAGGED

21:34.559 --> 21:36.862
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE BY HIS

21:36.928 --> 21:37.729
FEET, AND RIGHTLY SO.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.630
AND WHILE DUTERTE'S LANGUAGE MAY

21:38.697 --> 21:39.364
BE SHOCKING, HIS ACTIONS HAVE

21:39.431 --> 21:40.365
BEEN FAR WORSE, ESPECIALLY HIS

21:40.432 --> 21:41.033
WAR ON DRUGS.

21:41.099 --> 21:42.067
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT ON HIS

21:42.134 --> 21:43.101
WATCH, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR

21:43.168 --> 21:46.038
VIGILANTES HAVE KILLED UP TO

21:46.104 --> 21:46.705
30,000 PEOPLE, IN VIOLENCE

21:46.772 --> 21:47.606
WHICH EVEN TRIGGERED THE

21:47.673 --> 21:48.707
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT TO

21:48.774 --> 21:49.274
LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO

21:49.341 --> 21:50.042
POSSIBLE CRIMES AGAINST

21:50.108 --> 21:53.412
HUMANITY.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.514
AND DUTERTE HAS VICIOUSLY

21:55.580 --> 21:56.314
TARGETED HIS CRITICS.

21:56.381 --> 21:57.315
THIS SENATOR WHO LAUNCHED AN

21:57.382 --> 21:58.216
INVESTIGATION INTO HIS DRUG WAR

21:58.283 --> 21:58.850
HAS BEEN LANGUISHING IN JAIL FOR

21:58.917 --> 21:59.718
FIVE YEARS.

21:59.785 --> 22:00.719
AND NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER

22:00.786 --> 22:02.087
MARIA RESSA AND HER NEWS

22:02.154 --> 22:03.522
WEBSITE, RAPPLER, HAVE BEEN

22:03.588 --> 22:11.563
BURIED IN LEGAL ACTIONS, FACING

22:11.630 --> 22:12.364
AT LEAST 11 CASES AND 10

22:12.431 --> 22:13.098
ARREST WARRANTS SINCE DUTERTE

22:13.165 --> 22:14.366
CAME INTO OFFICE, AND THAT'S

22:14.433 --> 22:14.933
JUST THE BEGINNING.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.268
>> THE PHILIPPINES CONSISTENTLY

22:16.334 --> 22:16.935
RANKS AMONG THE TOP 10 DEADLIEST

22:17.002 --> 22:18.370
COUNTRIES FOR JOURNALISTS.

22:18.437 --> 22:19.471
REPORTS SAY AS MANY AS 19 OF

22:19.538 --> 22:20.939
THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE

22:21.006 --> 22:24.643
DUTERTE TOOK OFFICE.

22:24.710 --> 22:29.014
AT NEWS OF ONE, HE REPLIED,

22:29.081 --> 22:29.748
"JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A

22:29.815 --> 22:30.649
JOURNALIST YOU ARE NOT EXEMPTED

22:30.716 --> 22:31.883
FROM ASSASSINATION, IF YOU'RE A

22:31.950 --> 22:33.719
SON OF A ."

22:33.785 --> 22:34.753
>> HOLY SHIT.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.623
THAT SPEAKS NOT ONLY TO HIS

22:38.690 --> 22:39.191
BRUTALITY, BUT ALSO TO THE

22:39.257 --> 22:39.858
INCREDIBLE BRAVERY OF

22:39.925 --> 22:40.625
JOURNALISTS THERE.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.460
BECAUSE THE POSSIBILITY OF

22:41.526 --> 22:42.227
ASSASSINATION IS THE KIND OF

22:42.294 --> 22:42.894
THING THAT CAN THIN OUT A WORK

22:42.961 --> 22:45.697
FORCE.

22:49.668 --> 22:50.268
IF MICHAELS' JOB LISTINGS SAID,

22:50.335 --> 22:51.770
"APPLICANTS MUST HAVE SOME

22:51.837 --> 22:52.404
FAMILIARITY WITH CANDLE-MAKING,

22:52.471 --> 22:53.171
AND SCRAPBOOKING, ALSO, PLEASE

22:53.238 --> 22:54.005
EMPLOYEES ARE NOT EXEMPTED

22:54.072 --> 22:55.607
FROM ASSASSINATION IF THEY'RE

22:55.674 --> 22:56.241
SONS OF BITCHES," I DON'T THINK

22:56.308 --> 22:57.909
ANYONE WOULD WORK AT MICHAELS

22:57.976 --> 23:00.011
ANYMORE!

23:01.213 --> 23:02.180
NOW, THANKFULLY, DUTERTE'S TERM

23:02.247 --> 23:02.914
IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.316
PRESIDENTS IN THE PHILIPPINES

23:04.382 --> 23:05.584
CAN ONLY SERVE ONE SIX-YEAR

23:05.650 --> 23:06.618
TERM, AND ELECTIONS ARE ACTUALLY

23:06.685 --> 23:08.520
HAPPENING THERE TOMORROW.

23:08.587 --> 23:09.154
AND THIS IS A BIG ELECTION, IN

23:09.221 --> 23:10.956
EVERY SENSE.

23:11.022 --> 23:14.059
THE PHILIPPINES IS A NATION OF

23:14.126 --> 23:14.693
100 MILLION PEOPLE, AND TURNOUT

23:14.760 --> 23:16.128
IS OFTEN AROUND 80%.

23:16.194 --> 23:17.763
ALTHOUGH, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE

23:17.829 --> 23:18.430
ARE SOME DISCONCERTINGLY

23:18.497 --> 23:21.433
FAMILIAR FACES RUNNING.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.101
DUTERTE'S OWN DAUGHTER, SARA, IS

23:23.168 --> 23:24.736
RUNNING FOR VICE PRESIDENT, A

23:24.803 --> 23:25.270
POSITION WHICH IS ELECTED

23:25.337 --> 23:30.275
SEPARATELY.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.577
TO GET JUST A LITTLE SENSE OF

23:32.644 --> 23:33.945
HER, HERE SHE IS WHEN SHE WAS A

23:34.012 --> 23:34.880
MAYOR, PUNCHING A LOCAL SHERIFF

23:34.946 --> 23:37.682
THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WITH.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.017
AND IT IS NOT GREAT THAT YOU CAN

23:39.084 --> 23:40.485
LOOK AT THAT AND SAY, "WELL, AT

23:40.552 --> 23:41.086
LEAST SHE'S NOT AS VIOLENT AS

23:41.153 --> 23:42.854
HER DAD."

23:43.955 --> 23:44.856
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE RUNNING FOR

23:44.923 --> 23:46.024
PRESIDENT -- AND WHO'S ACTUALLY

23:46.091 --> 23:46.658
PRETTY LIKELY TO WIN -- WHO HAS

23:46.725 --> 23:49.127
AN EVEN MORE ALARMING LAST NAME.

23:49.194 --> 23:50.662
>> A FRONT-RUNNER IN THE CURRENT

23:50.729 --> 23:51.997
POLLS, FERDINAND "BONGBONG"

23:52.063 --> 23:54.266
MARCOS JR.

23:54.332 --> 23:56.501
HIS FATHER DECLARED MARTIAL LAW,

23:56.568 --> 23:58.036
RULING THE PHILIPPINES WITH A

23:58.103 --> 23:59.604
TERRIBLE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD,

23:59.671 --> 24:00.972
UNTIL A POPULAR UPRISING OUSTED

24:01.039 --> 24:03.241
HIM IN 1986.

24:03.308 --> 24:04.543
HIS MOTHER, IMELDA, IS STILL

24:04.609 --> 24:09.581
FAMOUS FOR HER SHOES.

24:09.648 --> 24:10.582
>> IT'S TRUE, THE SON OF A

24:10.649 --> 24:11.716
GUY WHO TERRORIZED THE

24:11.783 --> 24:12.851
PHILIPPINES FOR YEARS IS NOW THE

24:12.918 --> 24:13.351
FRONTRUNNER TO TAKE OVER.

24:13.418 --> 24:14.152
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING ANYONE

24:14.219 --> 24:14.820
SHOULD BE JUDGED SOLELY ON THEIR

24:14.886 --> 24:16.955
FAMILY NAME.

24:17.022 --> 24:20.525
IT'S JUST A LITTLE WEIRD IN HIS

24:20.592 --> 24:21.860
PARTICULAR CASE.

24:21.927 --> 24:28.466
IT'D BE LIKE IF THE MOST POPULAR

24:28.533 --> 24:29.367
FROZEN YOGURT CHAIN IN THE U.S.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.202
WAS CALLED "BIN LADEN'S FROYO

24:30.268 --> 24:32.704
DELIGHTS."

24:33.672 --> 24:34.339
I'M NOT SAYING A FROZEN YOGURT

24:34.406 --> 24:35.307
SHOP CAN'T BE CALLED THAT -- I

24:35.373 --> 24:36.074
JUST WOULDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE A

24:36.141 --> 24:37.042
NATIONAL HIT.

24:37.108 --> 24:38.210
THAT'S WHY THEY CHANGED IT TO

24:38.276 --> 24:39.744
PINKBERRY.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.812
AS FOR IMELDA MARCOS'S GIGANTIC

24:40.879 --> 24:41.746
SHOE COLLECTION, THAT WASN'T

24:41.813 --> 24:42.547
JUST A FUN PERSONALITY QUIRK.

24:42.614 --> 24:45.617
IT WAS A SIGN OF THE STAGGERING

24:45.684 --> 24:46.585
SCALE OF THE MARCOS' GRAFT.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.419
THEY EMBEZZLED BILLIONS OF

24:47.485 --> 24:48.286
DOLLARS FROM THE PHILIPPINES, TO

24:48.353 --> 24:49.788
THE POINT IT WAS ONCE RECOGNIZED

24:49.855 --> 24:50.989
BY THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS AS

24:51.056 --> 24:51.523
THE "GREATEST ROBBERY OF A

24:51.590 --> 24:53.892
GOVERNMENT."

24:53.959 --> 24:55.327
AND IT'S A BIT WEIRD FOR THEM TO

24:55.393 --> 24:56.127
BE HANDING OUT RECORDS FOR SUCH

24:56.194 --> 24:57.295
A TERRIBLE THING.

24:57.362 --> 24:59.097
IT'S LIKE GIVING LEE HARVEY

24:59.164 --> 24:59.798
OSWALD AN AWARD FOR "MOST JFKs

24:59.865 --> 25:02.500
SHOT."

25:03.802 --> 25:05.437
BUT THE ENORMITY OF THE MARCOS

25:05.503 --> 25:06.304
FAMILY'S THEFT MAKES HOW

25:06.371 --> 25:07.739
BONGBONG HAS DESCRIBED HIS

25:07.806 --> 25:10.942
CHILDHOOD ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

25:11.009 --> 25:11.843
THIS YEAR A LITTLE HARD TO

25:11.910 --> 25:13.245
SWALLOW.

25:13.311 --> 25:15.914
>> MY PARENTS WOULD NEVER LET

25:15.981 --> 25:17.482
US FORGET THAT THIS IS NOT --

25:17.549 --> 25:18.516
THIS IS NOT YOURS, THIS IS FROM

25:18.583 --> 25:20.452
THE PEOPLE.

25:20.518 --> 25:21.887
EVERYTHING WE HAVE, ALL THE

25:21.953 --> 25:24.055
ADVANTAGES THAT WE HAVE GAINED,

25:24.122 --> 25:26.324
ANY SUCCESSES WE HAVE ACHIEVED,

25:26.391 --> 25:28.927
AND ANY COMFORT OR PRIVILEGE WE

25:28.994 --> 25:35.967
ENJOY COMES FROM THE PEOPLE.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.937
>> - I'- THAT IS

25:39.004 --> 25:40.338
NOT TECHNICALLY INACCURATE.

25:40.405 --> 25:41.306
THE MARCOSES ARE SORT OF THE

25:41.373 --> 25:42.107
BRITISH MUSEUM OF FAMILIES, IN

25:42.173 --> 25:42.741
THAT MOST OF WHAT THEY HAVE IS

25:42.807 --> 25:45.310
FUCKING STOLEN.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.479
SO IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW ON

25:47.545 --> 25:48.346
EARTH IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE

25:48.413 --> 25:49.714
SON OF THE PHILIPPINES' MOST

25:49.781 --> 25:50.515
NOTORIOUS LEADER TO NOW BE ON

25:50.582 --> 25:51.383
THE BRINK OF RUNNING THE

25:51.449 --> 25:52.150
COUNTRY, THAT'S WHAT THIS STORY

25:52.217 --> 25:53.084
IS ABOUT.

25:53.151 --> 25:54.119
AND BEFORE WE START, LET'S

25:54.185 --> 25:54.719
ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A LOT OF

25:54.786 --> 25:55.553
HISTORY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE

25:55.620 --> 25:57.222
PHILIPPINES, AND NONE OF IT

25:57.289 --> 25:57.822
REFLECTS PARTICULARLY WELL ON

25:57.889 --> 25:59.925
US.

25:59.991 --> 26:01.293
TO GIVE A QUICK RUNDOWN, FIRST

26:01.359 --> 26:03.194
THE U.S. BOUGHT THE PHILIPPINES

26:03.261 --> 26:04.362
IN 1898, THEN UTTERLY BRUTALIZED

26:04.429 --> 26:05.397
THEM IN THEIR FIGHT FOR

26:05.463 --> 26:07.032
INDEPENDENCE IN THE

26:07.098 --> 26:08.833
PHILIPPINE-AMERICAN WAR --

26:08.900 --> 26:10.302
WHICH RESULTED IN 200,000

26:10.368 --> 26:12.137
CASUALTIES -- THEN SUBJECTED

26:12.203 --> 26:13.405
THEM TO 50 YEARS OF REPRESSIVE

26:13.471 --> 26:15.073
AND RACIST COLONIAL RULE, AND

26:15.140 --> 26:16.341
THEN, EVEN AFTER GRANTING THEM

26:16.408 --> 26:18.410
THEIR INDEPENDENCE IN 1946,

26:18.476 --> 26:19.577
CONTINUED TO USE THE CIA TO

26:19.644 --> 26:21.579
MEDDLE IN THEIR AFFAIRS.

26:21.646 --> 26:22.948
ALL IN ALL, IT WAS AN ATTITUDE

26:23.014 --> 26:28.219
OF UNCHECKED IMPERIALISM THAT

26:28.286 --> 26:29.120
WAS -- AND I DO NOT SAY THIS

26:29.187 --> 26:31.856
LIGHTLY -- BORDERLINE BRITISH.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.929
BUT THE STORY -- THAT HURT,

26:37.996 --> 26:39.397
DIDN'T IT?

26:39.464 --> 26:41.132
AND IT SHOULD HAVE DONE!

26:41.199 --> 26:42.334
BUT THE STORY OF THE MARCOS

26:42.400 --> 26:42.968
DYNASTY REALLY BEGINS IN 1965,

26:43.034 --> 26:43.902
WHEN FERDINAND MARCOS WAS

26:43.969 --> 26:45.070
ELECTED.

26:45.136 --> 26:46.004
AND WHILE INITIALLY PRESENTING

26:46.071 --> 26:46.604
HIMSELF AS A REFORMER, BY HIS

26:46.671 --> 26:48.006
SECOND TERM, FACING DISSENT, HE

26:48.073 --> 26:48.606
CRACKED DOWN HARD, INVENTING

26:48.673 --> 26:49.341
OR EXAGGERATING INTERNAL THREATS

26:49.407 --> 26:56.514
TO JUSTIFY IMPOSING MARTIAL LAW.

26:56.581 --> 27:03.188
AND THAT WAS A PERIOD WHICH WAS,

27:03.254 --> 27:03.855
TO PUT IT VERY, VERY

27:03.922 --> 27:04.556
MILDLY, A BAD TIME TO BE IN THE

27:04.622 --> 27:05.590
PHILIPPINES.

27:05.657 --> 27:06.491
UNDER MARTIAL LAW, SOME

27:06.558 --> 27:07.859
30,000 PEOPLE WERE TORTURED,

27:07.926 --> 27:08.760
AND THOUSANDS MORE WERE KILLED.

27:08.827 --> 27:09.394
AND ALL THE WHILE, THE MARCOSES

27:09.461 --> 27:10.028
WERE SIPHONING OFF MONEY ON AN

27:10.095 --> 27:10.962
ASTONISHING SCALE, WITH IMELDA

27:11.029 --> 27:11.997
PARTICULARLY ADEPT AT SPENDING

27:12.063 --> 27:12.931
IT.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.132
>> IMELDA, KNOWN AS "THE IRON

27:14.199 --> 27:15.066
BUTTERFLY," WOULD BECOME A

27:15.133 --> 27:17.235
NOTORIOUS JET-SETTING SOCIALITE

27:17.302 --> 27:18.370
AND FASHION ICON, AMASSING

27:18.436 --> 27:20.305
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN JEWELS,

27:20.372 --> 27:23.441
FINE ART, REAL ESTATE.

27:23.508 --> 27:25.443
HER TRAVELS SO LUXURIOUS, SHE

27:25.510 --> 27:27.379
ONCE REPORTEDLY SPENT $2,000 ON

27:27.445 --> 27:28.780
CHEWING GUM DURING A LAYOVER

27:28.847 --> 27:30.949
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

27:31.016 --> 27:33.418
SHE EVEN FORCED AN AIRPLANE

27:33.485 --> 27:34.719
DEPARTING ROME TO MAKE A U-TURN

27:34.786 --> 27:35.720
BECAUSE SHE FORGOT TO BUY

27:35.787 --> 27:41.159
CHEESE.

27:41.493 --> 27:45.130
>> HOLD ON, I DO HAVE

27:45.196 --> 27:46.364
SOME QUESTIONS THERE.

27:46.431 --> 27:47.132
FIRST, WHAT DO YOU MEAN "FORCED

27:47.198 --> 27:51.302
AN AIRPLANE"?

27:51.369 --> 27:52.637
DID IMELDA STORM THE COCKPIT?

27:52.704 --> 27:53.438
DID A PILOT SAY A SOFT PRAYER TO

27:53.505 --> 27:54.239
SEE HIS CHILDREN AGAIN ALL

27:54.305 --> 27:54.906
BECAUSE IMELDA MARCOS HAD A

27:54.973 --> 27:55.974
HANKERING FOR PECORINO?

27:56.041 --> 27:56.841
ALSO, IF YOU FORGET TO BUY

27:56.908 --> 27:57.742
CHEESE IN ITALY, YOU'RE OKAY!

27:57.809 --> 27:58.443
FILIPINO CUISINE IS PERFECTLY

27:58.510 --> 28:00.011
DELICIOUS WITHOUT IT.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.046
ANYONE WHO'S EATEN A SINGLE

28:01.112 --> 28:02.080
PLATE OF ADOBO KNOWS THAT

28:02.147 --> 28:03.348
THERE'S NO NEED TO INTRODUCE

28:03.415 --> 28:06.351
AGED COW JIZZ INTO THE EQUATION.

28:07.552 --> 28:08.420
BUT AS THE MARCOSES PLUNDERED

28:08.486 --> 28:09.754
AND MISMANAGED THE COUNTRY, THE

28:09.821 --> 28:10.922
AVERAGE FILIPINO SUFFERED BADLY.

28:10.989 --> 28:13.191
THE ECONOMY WAS IN CRISIS AND

28:13.258 --> 28:15.160
THE INCOMES OF WAGE LABORERS

28:15.226 --> 28:16.761
DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY, TO THE

28:16.828 --> 28:17.862
POINT THAT, BY THE END OF

28:17.929 --> 28:18.897
FERDINAND'S TIME IN OFFICE, MANY

28:18.963 --> 28:20.265
FILIPINOS WERE SURVIVING ON

28:20.331 --> 28:22.801
LESS THAN $2 A DAY.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.070
AND WHILE, AGAIN, BONGBONG ISN'T

28:25.136 --> 28:26.271
INNATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

28:26.337 --> 28:27.772
ACTIONS OF HIS FATHER, HE VERY

28:27.839 --> 28:28.540
MUCH BENEFITED FROM THAT

28:28.606 --> 28:31.843
SPENDING SPREE.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.211
THE MARCOSES LAVISHED MONEY ON

28:33.278 --> 28:33.978
THEIR CHILDREN, INCLUDING THIS

28:34.045 --> 28:34.479
BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR THEIR

28:34.546 --> 28:41.419
DAUGHTER.

28:41.486 --> 28:42.454
>> EXTRAVAGANT PARTIES ON THE

28:42.520 --> 28:43.354
PRESIDENTIAL YACHT, DECADENT BY

28:43.421 --> 28:43.955
THE STANDARDS OF THIS CATHOLIC

28:44.022 --> 28:45.890
NATION.

28:45.957 --> 28:47.325
FERDINAND JR., NICKNAMED

28:47.392 --> 28:49.027
"BONGBONG," GOVERNOR OF THE

28:49.094 --> 28:50.261
FAMILY'S HOME PROVINCE, IS THE

28:50.328 --> 28:55.166
MAN IN THE FLASHING BOW TIE.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.236
>> WHAT DID I JUST WATCH

28:58.303 --> 28:58.436
THERE?

28:58.503 --> 29:01.973
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

29:02.040 --> 29:02.607
MORE UNSETTLING ABOUT THAT, THE

29:02.674 --> 29:03.541
ADULT BABY EMERGING FROM A CAKE

29:03.608 --> 29:04.609
SCREAMING "MOMMY," OR THE FACT

29:04.676 --> 29:05.276
THAT WHILE BONGBONG LOOKS VERY

29:05.343 --> 29:06.177
YOUNG THERE, HE WAS ACTUALLY A

29:06.244 --> 29:06.945
GOVERNOR THEN.

29:07.011 --> 29:07.579
AND HONESTLY, I WOULDN'T TRUST A

29:07.645 --> 29:08.246
MAN WEARING THAT BOWTIE TO RUN

29:08.313 --> 29:09.481
ANYTHING.

29:09.547 --> 29:10.482
I WOULDN'T EVEN TRUST HIM WITH

29:10.548 --> 29:11.216
THE JOB HE'

29:11.282 --> 29:11.983
BRINGING OUT THE BIRTHDAY CAKE

29:12.050 --> 29:14.319
AT AN OLIVE GARDEN.

29:15.620 --> 29:16.654
NOW, THE MARCOSES WERE

29:16.721 --> 29:17.889
ULTIMATELY FORCED TO FLEE THE

29:17.956 --> 29:18.523
COUNTRY AFTER A MASS UPRISING IN

29:18.590 --> 29:19.757
1986.

29:19.824 --> 29:23.328
BUT FERDINAND HELD ON TO THE

29:23.394 --> 29:24.462
BILLIONS THAT HE STOLE.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.398
THE FAMILY WERE

29:27.465 --> 29:28.299
GRANTED ASYLUM IN HAWAII, AND

29:28.366 --> 29:29.334
TOOK A LOT WITH THEM ON THE

29:29.400 --> 29:37.008
PLANE, SHOWING UP WITH

29:37.075 --> 29:38.143
$7 MILLION IN CASH

29:38.209 --> 29:39.010
AND GEMS, AND TWENTY-FOUR BARS

29:39.077 --> 29:48.486
OF SOLID GOLD ENGRAVED "TO MY

29:48.553 --> 29:49.587
HUSBAND ON OUR 24th

29:49.654 --> 29:50.321
ANNIVERSARY."

29:50.388 --> 29:51.089
WHICH ISN'T REMOTELY ROMANTIC.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.824
THAT ANNIVERSARY PRESENT IS THE

29:52.891 --> 29:53.825
PILFERING BILLIONAIRE EQUIVALENT

29:53.892 --> 29:55.026
OF HANDING YOUR SPOUSE AN

29:55.093 --> 29:55.627
ENVELOPE FULL OF CASH WITH "WE

29:55.693 --> 29:56.261
HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 24 YEARS

29:56.327 --> 29:58.296
AS OF TODAY."

29:58.363 --> 29:58.930
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THEY HAD TO LEAVE

29:58.997 --> 29:59.597
SOME THINGS BEHIND, AND FOR MANY

29:59.664 --> 30:00.532
IN THE PHILIPPINES, IT WAS A

30:00.598 --> 30:01.166
REAL SHOCK TO SEE THE SHEER

30:01.232 --> 30:02.000
EXTENT TO WHICH THEY'D BEEN

30:02.066 --> 30:05.837
ROBBED.

30:05.904 --> 30:08.706
>> FILIPINOS WHO USED TO BE

30:08.773 --> 30:10.875
BLOCKS GOT AN UNEXPECTED

30:10.942 --> 30:13.144
KALEIDOSCOPE OF UNIMAGINABLE

30:13.211 --> 30:13.378
LUXURY.

30:13.444 --> 30:14.212
>> WOW.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.146
>> INCLUDING THE FORMER FIRST

30:15.213 --> 30:15.914
LADY'S 10-FOOT-WIDE BED.

30:15.980 --> 30:16.748
>> THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE

30:16.814 --> 30:17.782
HERE IN THE PHILIPPINES ARE

30:17.849 --> 30:18.183
STARVING.

30:18.249 --> 30:18.983
>> AS FAR AS RAY IS CONCERNED,

30:19.050 --> 30:21.819
THE MARCOSES BELONG IN JAIL.

30:21.886 --> 30:22.620
>> HE CAN COME BACK

30:22.687 --> 30:23.821
HERE IN THE PHILIPPINES TO FACE

30:23.888 --> 30:24.389
WHAT HE DO THE PEOPLE OF THE

30:24.455 --> 30:28.026
PHILIPPINES.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.762
>> YEAH, IT'S FUNNY.

30:30.828 --> 30:33.164
SEEING THE WEALTH OF THE RULERS

30:33.231 --> 30:34.532
WHO RIPPED YOU OFF DOES TEND TO

30:34.599 --> 30:36.100
PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.068
IT'S LIKE HOW AFTER

30:37.135 --> 30:37.835
FRENCH WORKERS LEARNED OF THE

30:37.902 --> 30:40.905
MAJESTY OF VERSAILLES IN

30:40.972 --> 30:42.507
THE 18th CENTURY, THE REVOLUTION

30:42.574 --> 30:45.877
WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

30:45.944 --> 30:46.511
"HOLD ON, THEY HAVE FOUR GOLD

30:46.578 --> 30:47.212
PLATED PIPE ORGANS?

30:47.278 --> 30:48.046
YEAH, THESE MOTHERFUCKERS ARE

30:48.112 --> 30:49.948
GONNA HAVE TO GO."

30:50.848 --> 30:51.883
NOW, IN THE END, A GOVERNMENT

30:51.950 --> 30:52.684
COMMISSION WAS SET UP TO TRACK

30:52.750 --> 30:56.688
DOWN AND RECOVER THE STOLEN

30:56.754 --> 30:57.455
36

30:57.522 --> 30:58.556
YEARS LATER, THANKS TO COURT

30:58.623 --> 30:59.190
DELAYS AND THE MARCOSES FIGHTING

30:59.257 --> 31:00.725
THEM THE WHOLE WAY, THEY

31:00.792 --> 31:01.326
HAVE ONLY RETRIEVED ABOUT FIVE

31:01.392 --> 31:02.160
BILLION, OR AROUND HALF OF WHAT

31:02.227 --> 31:02.794
WAS ESTIMATED STOLEN.

31:02.860 --> 31:03.795
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

31:03.861 --> 31:04.762
BONGBONG WAS ACTUALLY DIRECTLY

31:04.829 --> 31:05.830
ASKED ABOUT WHEN HE RAN FOR VICE

31:05.897 --> 31:06.764
PRESIDENT SIX YEARS AGO, AND HIS

31:06.831 --> 31:07.365
RESPONSE BACK THEN WAS PRETTY

31:07.432 --> 31:13.638
INFURIATING.

31:28.453 --> 31:31.489
>> I CANNOT GIVE WHAT I DO

31:31.556 --> 31:33.024
NOT HAVE.

31:33.091 --> 31:35.326
I DO NOT HAVE WHAT YOU ARE --

31:35.393 --> 31:37.061
I DO NOT HAVE CONTROL.

31:37.128 --> 31:38.129
I DO NOT HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF

31:38.196 --> 31:39.964
ANY OF THE THINGS.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.966
ONCE AGAIN, LET ME REPEAT, I

31:42.033 --> 31:48.039
CANNOT GIVE WHAT I DO NOT HAVE.

31:48.106 --> 31:49.073
>> YEAH, NOT GREAT.

31:49.140 --> 31:49.574
BUT ALSO, CREDIT TO THE

31:49.641 --> 31:50.408
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER THERE,

31:50.475 --> 31:51.309
WHO MANAGED TO GET ACROSS NOT

31:51.376 --> 31:54.245
JUST WHAT HE WAS SAYING, BUT

31:54.312 --> 31:56.614
ALSO COMMUNICATE HIS WHOLE "BIG

31:56.681 --> 31:57.782
ANGRY CRYBABY" VIBE.

31:57.849 --> 31:58.850
I'M JUST SAYING, IT IS PRETTY

31:58.916 --> 31:59.751
IMPRESSIVE THAT BONGBONG'S

31:59.817 --> 32:01.019
SOMEHOW THE BIGGEST BABY IN A

32:01.085 --> 32:03.221
PIECE THAT ALSO CONTAINS THIS

32:03.288 --> 32:06.057
FUCKING GUY.

32:08.092 --> 32:08.926
AND YET, DESPITE BEING BOOED

32:08.993 --> 32:09.594
FOR THAT RESPONSE, BONGBONG IS

32:09.661 --> 32:10.228
NOW ON THE EDGE OF BEING ELECTED

32:10.295 --> 32:10.862
PRESIDENT.

32:10.928 --> 32:12.030
AND THAT'S BECAUSE, OVER THE

32:12.096 --> 32:12.630
PAST DECADE, SOMETHING KIND OF

32:12.697 --> 32:14.399
REMARKABLE HAS HAPPENED IN THE

32:17.235 --> 32:17.902
THAT IS, HISTORY HAS BEEN

32:17.969 --> 32:19.237
REWRITTEN.

32:19.304 --> 32:20.738
>> SINCE THE RETURN OF THE

32:20.805 --> 32:22.840
MARCOSES, THERE'S BEEN A TRICKLE

32:22.907 --> 32:27.245
OF NEW INFORMATION IN YOUTUBE,

32:27.312 --> 32:28.146
IN GOOGLE THAT'S A REVISION OF

32:28.212 --> 32:28.613
THE INTERPRETATION OF

32:28.680 --> 32:34.519
MARTIAL LAW.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.707
>> WOW.

32:55.773 --> 32:56.474
THAT IS A STARK REWRITING OF A

32:56.541 --> 33:01.646
TERRIBLE PERIOD.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.515
AND I DO REALIZE THE U.S. ISN'T

33:04.582 --> 33:05.550
EXACTLY PERFECT HERE, EITHER.

33:05.616 --> 33:06.351
WE GRAPPLE WITH OUR GREATEST

33:06.417 --> 33:07.085
MONSTERS BY PUTTING UP CONSTANT

33:07.151 --> 33:08.019
REMINDERS OF THEM, ON

33:08.086 --> 33:09.087
MOUNTAINS, IN TOWN SQUARES, AND

33:09.153 --> 33:11.089
ON CRISP $20 BILLS.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.124
AND THIS WILLFUL DISTORTION OF

33:13.191 --> 33:14.492
HISTORY HAS BEEN MASSIVELY

33:14.559 --> 33:16.160
ABETTED BY THE INTERNET, AS THE

33:16.227 --> 33:17.295
PHILIPPINES FREQUENTLY RANKS AS

33:17.362 --> 33:18.930
THE MOST ONLINE NATION IN THE

33:18.996 --> 33:21.299
WORLD.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.034
THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING

33:23.101 --> 33:24.268
DUTERTE VERY MUCH BENEFITED

33:24.335 --> 33:25.169
FROM, AS HE RODE A WAVE OF

33:25.236 --> 33:26.337
FALSE STORIES, PAID TROLLING,

33:26.404 --> 33:26.971
AND FACEBOOK ENGAGEMENT ALL THE

33:27.038 --> 33:28.606
WAY TO THE PRESIDENCY.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.742
IN FACT, FACEBOOK ITSELF EVEN

33:30.808 --> 33:33.211
CALLED HIM THE "UNDISPUTED KING

33:33.277 --> 33:34.879
OF FACEBOOK CONVERSATIONS,"

33:34.946 --> 33:37.081
A TITLE SURPRISINGLY NOT HELD BY

33:37.148 --> 33:38.349
YOUR UNCLE WHO HAS SOME HOT

33:38.416 --> 33:39.751
TAKES ON THE VACCINE HE THINKS

33:39.817 --> 33:43.254
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

33:43.588 --> 33:44.355
AND THE INTERNET IS NOW

33:44.422 --> 33:45.456
SIMILARLY AWASH IN FACEBOOK

33:45.523 --> 33:46.691
POSTS AND TIKTOK

33:46.758 --> 33:47.859
VIDEOS THAT BOTH GLORIFY AND

33:47.925 --> 33:49.761
ROMANTICIZE THE MARCOS FAMILY.

33:49.827 --> 33:51.329
POPULAR POSTS ON FACEBOOK HAVE

33:51.396 --> 33:52.797
EXPLAINED AWAY FERDINAND'S ILL

33:52.864 --> 34:01.072
GOTTEN WEALTH, SAYING

34:01.139 --> 34:02.840
HIS FORTUNE WAS LEFT BY A

34:02.907 --> 34:06.677
JAPANESE GENERAL AFTER WORLD WAS

34:06.744 --> 34:08.012
EARNED FOR BEING A FANTASTIC

34:08.079 --> 34:09.247
LAWYER.

34:09.313 --> 34:10.281
THERE'S ALSO THIS ONE SUGGESTING

34:10.348 --> 34:10.915
THAT MARCOS, AT ONE POINT, GAVE

34:10.982 --> 34:12.083
BREAD TO A YOUNG MICHAEL JORDAN.

34:12.150 --> 34:12.917
IT SEEMS TO HAVE ORIGINATED AS A

34:12.984 --> 34:13.618
JOKE, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN PASSED

34:13.684 --> 34:14.485
AROUND COMPLETELY SERIOUSLY.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.119
AND LET'S JUST BREAK THIS STORY

34:15.186 --> 34:17.388
DOWN.

34:17.455 --> 34:18.723
ON DECEMBER 24, 1969, THE

34:18.790 --> 34:20.191
MARCOS FAMILY WAS IN WILMINGTON,

34:20.258 --> 34:20.925
NORTH CAROLINA, TO CELEBRATE THE

34:20.992 --> 34:23.027
HOLIDAYS -- THAT TRACKS, BECAUSE

34:23.094 --> 34:25.163
IF YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE FROM THE

34:25.229 --> 34:25.797
OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND YOU

34:25.863 --> 34:28.699
WANT TO CELEBRATE THE HOLIDAYS

34:28.766 --> 34:29.700
IN AMERICA, THERE IS ONLY ONE

34:29.767 --> 34:31.602
PLACE YOU'RE GOING, AND

34:31.669 --> 34:32.103
THAT'S WILMINGTON, NORTH

34:32.170 --> 34:34.539
CAROLINA.

34:37.675 --> 34:38.176
THEN PRESIDENT MARCOS WAS

34:38.242 --> 34:39.844
WALKING IN A PARK AND HE SAW A

34:39.911 --> 34:40.445
SKINNY CHILD BEGGING FOR FOOD.

34:40.511 --> 34:42.113
HE GAVE HIM A WHOLE BOX OF

34:42.180 --> 34:42.680
NUTRIBUN, AND SAID, "BRING

34:42.747 --> 34:43.548
THIS WITH YOU CHILD, SOMEDAY YOU

34:43.614 --> 34:44.148
WILL GROW UP TO BE SOMEONE

34:44.215 --> 34:48.986
IMPORTANT."

34:49.053 --> 34:49.620
SO, TO BE CLEAR, IN THIS STORY,

34:49.687 --> 34:52.256
PRESIDENT MARCOS WAS WALKING

34:52.323 --> 34:53.224
THROUGH A PARK, HOLDING BREAD.

34:53.291 --> 34:53.758
SPECIFICALLY, NUTRIBUN, A

34:53.825 --> 34:54.292
BREAD MAINLY SOLD IN THE

34:54.358 --> 34:54.992
PHILIPPINES.

34:55.059 --> 34:55.726
MEANING MARCOS FLEW TO THE

34:55.793 --> 34:56.661
UNITED STATES WITH NUTRIBUN,

34:56.727 --> 34:58.329
BECAUSE HE WAS LIKE,

34:58.396 --> 35:00.431
"WHAT IF WE GET TO WILMINGTON,

35:00.498 --> 35:01.799
NORTH CAROLINA, MY FAVORITE

35:01.866 --> 35:02.567
HOLIDAY DESTINATION, AND THEY

35:02.633 --> 35:04.001
DON'T HAVE ANY BREAD THERE?"

35:04.068 --> 35:04.936
THEN HE WENT TO THE PARK AND

35:05.002 --> 35:05.903
PASSED, LIKE, TEN OTHER KIDS,

35:05.970 --> 35:07.538
THINKING, "NONE OF YOU ARE GONNA

35:07.605 --> 35:08.473
GROW UP TO BE IMPORTANT, YOU'RE

35:08.539 --> 35:11.309
NOT GETTING ANY OF MY PARK

35:11.375 --> 35:13.077
BREAD," THEN SAW MICHAEL JORDAN

35:13.144 --> 35:17.615
AND WAS LIKE, "WAIT,

35:17.682 --> 35:19.584
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT YOU ARE

35:19.650 --> 35:20.618
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT.

35:20.685 --> 35:21.252
SO HERE, HAVE THIS BREAD THAT I

35:21.319 --> 35:21.853
BROUGHT WITH ME FROM THE OTHER

35:21.919 --> 35:22.653
SIDE OF THE WORLD."

35:22.720 --> 35:23.488
AND THEN THAT KID GREW UP TO BE

35:23.554 --> 35:24.355
MICHAEL JORDAN, THE GREATEST

35:24.422 --> 35:24.889
BASKETBALL PLAYER WHO EVER

35:24.956 --> 35:29.560
LIVED.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.528
THAT IS THE SINGLE DUMBEST STORY

35:30.595 --> 35:31.295
INVOLVING A YOUNG MICHAEL JORDAN

35:31.362 --> 35:31.896
I HAVE EVER HEARD, AND I HAVE

35:31.963 --> 35:34.265
SEEN "SPACE JAM."

35:37.635 --> 35:38.436
SO THAT IS JUST A TASTE OF THE

35:38.503 --> 35:39.604
ONLINE NONSENSE WHICH IS

35:39.670 --> 35:40.338
SUCCESSFULLY REFRAMING THE

35:40.404 --> 35:41.372
MARCOS FAMILY HISTORY.

35:41.439 --> 35:44.075
AND AT THE SAME TIME, BONGBONG'S

35:44.141 --> 35:45.476
MAIN RIVAL, LENI ROBREDO, THE

35:45.543 --> 35:46.077
CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT AND THE

35:46.143 --> 35:47.678
WOMAN YOU SAW CHALLENGING HIM IN

35:47.745 --> 35:49.013
THAT DEBATE CLIP EARLIER, HAS

35:49.080 --> 35:50.081
FACED VICIOUS ATTACKS ONLINE,

35:50.147 --> 35:50.815
RANGING FROM FALSE ALLEGATIONS

35:50.882 --> 35:52.083
THAT SHE HAS TIES TO ARMED

35:52.149 --> 35:52.984
COMMUNIST REBELS TO PHONY

35:53.050 --> 35:53.851
RUMORS THAT SHE MURDERED HER

35:53.918 --> 35:54.986
HUSBAND.

35:55.052 --> 35:56.254
IN FACT, FACT-CHECKERS HAVE

35:56.320 --> 35:57.188
REPORTED THAT ALMOST ALL THE

35:57.255 --> 35:59.223
DISINFORMATION ABOUT

35:59.290 --> 36:00.725
ROBREDO IS NEGATIVE, WHILE ANY

36:00.791 --> 36:01.659
DISINFORMATION ABOUT BONGBONG

36:01.726 --> 36:02.660
OVERWHELMINGLY PUTS HIM IN A

36:02.727 --> 36:04.662
POSITIVE LIGHT.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.797
BUT MAYBE THE MOST FANTASTICAL

36:06.864 --> 36:08.833
LIE THAT BONGBONG'S CAMPAIGN HAS

36:08.900 --> 36:10.468
TOLD IS ACTUALLY THE MOST

36:14.005 --> 36:14.972
THAT HE IS NOT THE SCION OF A

36:15.039 --> 36:16.140
POLITICAL CRIME FAMILY, HE'S

36:16.207 --> 36:17.575
JUST A REGULAR, ORDINARY CITIZEN

36:17.642 --> 36:18.175
WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE RUNNING

36:18.242 --> 36:20.978
FOR PRESIDENT.

36:21.045 --> 36:21.946
IN FACT, HERE IS HOW HIS WIFE

36:22.013 --> 36:22.547
DESCRIBED THE EXACT MOMENT HE

36:22.613 --> 36:26.083
DECIDED TO RUN.

36:26.150 --> 36:28.920
>> YOU KNOW, SIX MONTHS AGO, HE

36:28.986 --> 36:31.489
WASN'T YET SURE WHAT TO DO, WE

36:31.556 --> 36:32.423
HAD NO PARTY, YOU KNOW.

36:32.490 --> 36:35.493
AND THEN ONE DAY WE WERE

36:35.560 --> 36:40.631
WATCHING "ANT-MAN" IN THE ROOM

36:40.698 --> 36:44.268
AND THEN HE LOOKED AT -- BECAUSE

36:44.335 --> 36:45.570
WE LOVE

36:45.636 --> 36:46.771
MARVEL MOVIES, AND THEN HE

36:46.837 --> 36:47.338
LOOKED AT ME AND HE

36:47.405 --> 36:48.472
GOES, "OKAY, WE'RE GONNA DO

36:48.539 --> 36:49.340
THIS," HE TOLD ME.

36:49.407 --> 36:49.774
I SAID, "DO WHAT?"

36:49.840 --> 36:50.374
"RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY."

36:50.441 --> 36:52.977
>> NO FUCKING WAY.

36:53.477 --> 36:54.445
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

36:54.512 --> 36:55.079
I AM CALLING TOTAL BULLSHIT ON

36:55.146 --> 36:57.582
THE IDEA THAT BONGBONG DECIDED

36:57.648 --> 37:01.118
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OUT OF

37:01.185 --> 37:01.719
NOWHERE, MID MARVEL FILM.

37:01.786 --> 37:02.353
MAINLY BECAUSE I CAN THINK OF A

37:02.420 --> 37:04.655
MUCH MORE SALIENT REASON HE'D

37:07.692 --> 37:08.526
HOLD SWAY OVER THE COMMISSION

37:08.593 --> 37:09.226
DEVOTED TO INVESTIGATING AND

37:09.293 --> 37:10.661
RECOVERING HIS FAMILY'S WEALTH,

37:10.728 --> 37:14.966
AS WELL AS THE TAX OFFICE.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.834
WHICH WOULD BE PARTICULARLY

37:16.901 --> 37:17.668
USEFUL FOR HIM, AS

37:17.735 --> 37:18.536
THE MARCOSES HAVE REFUSED TO PAY

37:18.603 --> 37:19.737
A TAX BILL THAT REPORTEDLY

37:19.804 --> 37:20.504
AMOUNTS TO $3.9 BILLION DOLLARS,

37:20.571 --> 37:21.339
INCLUDING PENALTIES.

37:21.405 --> 37:22.173
SO BONGBONG COULD EASILY TELL

37:22.239 --> 37:24.175
HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION TO JUST

37:24.241 --> 37:24.775
FORGET ABOUT HIS MASSIVE DEBT,

37:24.842 --> 37:25.643
WHICH IS CLEARLY AN APPEALING

37:25.710 --> 37:26.243
IDEA.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.311
IN FACT, WHEN YOU THINK OF IT,

37:27.378 --> 37:28.279
"ANT-MAN" COULD ACTUALLY BE THE

37:28.346 --> 37:29.547
PERFECT MOVIE TO INSPIRE HIM TO

37:29.614 --> 37:30.147
RUN FOR PRESIDENT, GIVEN THAT

37:30.214 --> 37:30.781
IT'S ABOUT A THIEF WHOSE

37:30.848 --> 37:31.849
QUESTIONABLE PAST IS FORGOTTEN

37:31.916 --> 37:32.950
AFTER HE RISES TO POWER USING

37:33.017 --> 37:37.888
RESOURCES THAT HE ALSO STOLE.

37:40.558 --> 37:41.359
BUT I WILL SAY, BONGBONG'S BRAND

37:41.425 --> 37:42.226
RELAUNCH HASN'T WORKED ON

37:42.293 --> 37:42.994
EVERYONE.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.428
PLENTY OF FILIPINOS ARE STILL

37:44.495 --> 37:46.030
OPPOSED TO HIM, AND TO HAVING

37:46.097 --> 37:46.597
THE MARCOS ERA REWRITTEN IN

37:46.664 --> 37:48.833
FRONT OF THEIR VERY EYES.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.302
DESPITE TRAILING BONGBONG

37:51.369 --> 37:52.536
MASSIVELY IN THE POLLS,

37:52.603 --> 37:57.108
LENI ROBREDO HAS INSPIRED

37:57.174 --> 37:58.442
HUGE RALLIES THERE.

37:58.509 --> 37:59.744
AND WALDEN BELLO, WHO'S RUNNING

37:59.810 --> 38:01.112
AGAINST SARA DUTERTE FOR VICE

38:01.178 --> 38:03.080
PRESIDENT, HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN

38:03.147 --> 38:06.217
ABOUT JUST HOW OUTRAGEOUS THIS

38:06.283 --> 38:06.917
ALL IS.

38:06.984 --> 38:08.119
>> MARCOS HAS CREATED A BIG

38:08.185 --> 38:16.227
PUBLIC RELATIONS MACHINE THAT

38:16.293 --> 38:23.634
USES SOCIAL MEDIA TO TRY TO

38:23.701 --> 38:30.207
CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THE 14

38:30.274 --> 38:32.810
YEARS OF MARTIAL LAW, NOT THE

38:32.877 --> 38:34.045
COLLECTIVE NIGHTMARE, HE'S

38:34.111 --> 38:35.713
TRYING TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA AND

38:35.780 --> 38:38.049
HIS HUNDREDS OF TROLLS TO SAY

38:38.115 --> 38:40.518
"MY GOD, THIS IS THE FAMILY THAT

38:40.584 --> 38:41.485
HAS RAPED THE COUNTRY, IT HAS

38:41.552 --> 38:43.688
NOT APOLOGIZED TO THE COUNTRY,

38:43.754 --> 38:44.622
AND HE NOW WANTS TO RAPE

38:44.689 --> 38:45.022
THE COUNTRY AGAIN.

38:45.089 --> 38:47.725
FUCK YOU, MARCOS!

38:48.325 --> 38:49.093
>> YEAH, WELL PUT.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.194
AND THE THING IS, NO MATTER HOW

38:50.261 --> 38:50.728
HARD YOU TRY TO REINVENT

38:50.795 --> 38:51.729
YOURSELF, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING

38:51.796 --> 38:52.663
TO BE SOME PEOPLE WHO REMEMBER

38:52.730 --> 38:53.130
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

38:53.197 --> 38:54.165
WHETHER YOU'RE A NEW COLLEGE

38:54.231 --> 38:54.765
FRESHMAN TRYING ON A BRITISH

38:54.832 --> 38:55.399
ACCENT, OR A MASSIVE TECH

38:55.466 --> 38:56.567
OLIGARCHY TRYING TO PAPER OVER

38:56.634 --> 38:57.368
ITS COMPLICITY IN VIOLENCE AND

38:57.435 --> 39:05.676
GENOCIDE.

39:05.743 --> 39:06.410
HEY, MARK, I THINK META'S

39:06.477 --> 39:07.445
REALLY STARTING TO CATCH ON!

39:07.511 --> 39:08.879
GIVE IT A FEW MORE WEEKS, MAYBE.

39:08.946 --> 39:12.249
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, BUDDY!

39:12.316 --> 39:14.552
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY

39:14.618 --> 39:14.919
PUMPED FOR THIS.

39:15.786 --> 39:16.520
IT HAS BEEN AMAZING TO SEE THE

39:16.587 --> 39:17.088
PHILIPPINES ELECTION UNFOLD.

39:17.154 --> 39:17.621
BECAUSE IN THIS ELECTION,

39:17.688 --> 39:18.255
THEY'RE NOT JUST VOTING ON THEIR

39:18.322 --> 39:18.923
FUTURE.

39:18.989 --> 39:19.523
THEY'RE VOTING ON THEIR PAST.

39:19.590 --> 39:20.224
SPECIFICALLY, WHICH ONE DO THEY

39:20.291 --> 39:24.995
WANT TO BELIEVE?

39:25.062 --> 39:26.831
THE ONE WHERE FERDINAND MARCOS

39:26.897 --> 39:28.866
WREAKED HAVOC ON A COUNTRY AND

39:28.933 --> 39:29.467
ITS PEOPLE UNDER MARTIAL LAW?

39:29.533 --> 39:30.301
OR THE ONE WHERE HE WAS SOMEHOW

39:30.367 --> 39:31.235
THE GREATEST NBA SCOUT OF ALL

39:31.302 --> 39:33.871
TIME?

39:34.638 --> 39:35.406
AND I KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE

39:35.473 --> 39:36.807
WATCHING THIS AREN'T ELIGIBLE TO

39:36.874 --> 39:37.408
VOTE IN IT -- ALTHOUGH, IF YOU

39:37.475 --> 39:38.409
ARE, AND YOU'RE WATCHING,

39:38.476 --> 39:39.543
"KUMUSTA, MARAMING SALAMAT PO!"

39:39.610 --> 39:41.145
AND TO YOU, LET ME JUST SAY

39:41.212 --> 39:42.146
THIS, I GET WHY YOU'D BE

39:42.213 --> 39:43.214
SKEPTICAL ABOUT A BREAKDOWN OF

39:43.280 --> 39:44.648
YOUR POLITICS FROM SOMEONE WITH

39:44.715 --> 39:48.519
WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS

39:48.586 --> 39:50.988
"BIG COLONIZER ENERGY," AND WHO

39:51.055 --> 39:52.389
LIVES IN A COUNTRY THAT IS NO

39:52.456 --> 39:53.190
STRANGER TO DISHONEST

39:53.257 --> 39:54.225
BILLIONAIRES WHO PROPELLED

39:54.291 --> 39:54.759
THEMSELVES TO POWER WITH

39:54.825 --> 39:57.428
FACEBOOK LIES.

39:57.495 --> 39:58.529
SO LOOK, DON'T LISTEN TO ME.

39:58.596 --> 39:59.697
BUT MAYBE DO LISTEN TO YOUR

39:59.764 --> 40:01.298
FELLOW CITIZENS WHO BOTH

40:01.365 --> 40:01.966
REMEMBER THE PAST AND ARE

40:02.032 --> 40:03.033
DETERMINED NOT TO REPEAT IT.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.436
BECAUSE BONGBONG MARCOS HAS

40:05.503 --> 40:06.504
SHOWN VIRTUALLY NO REMORSE FOR

40:06.570 --> 40:07.138
WHAT HIS FATHER PUT THE COUNTRY

40:07.204 --> 40:08.105
THROUGH.

40:08.172 --> 40:09.907
AND IF THE PHILIPPINES IS TO

40:09.974 --> 40:10.741
AVOID MORE OF THE SAME GRAFT AND

40:10.808 --> 40:15.412
VIOLENCE THAT THEY'VE

40:15.479 --> 40:16.647
EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST 50

40:16.714 --> 40:19.617
YEARS, THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

40:19.683 --> 40:20.351
THESE PEOPLE AND OTHERS TO

40:20.417 --> 40:21.252
CONTINUE BRAVELY SPEAKING OUT

40:21.318 --> 40:21.786
AND TELLING THE LIKES OF

40:21.852 --> 40:22.386
BONGBONG MARCOS, IF I MAY USE

40:22.453 --> 40:24.488
THE POETIC WORDS OF THE

40:24.555 --> 40:25.055
PHILIPPINES' CURRENT ASSHOLE

40:25.122 --> 40:29.593
PRESIDENT, "FUCK YOU."

40:30.161 --> 40:35.733
AND NOW THIS.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.535
>> AND NOW W DIV METEOROLOGIST

40:37.601 --> 40:41.138
ENJOYS CINCO de MAYO A LITTLE

40:41.205 --> 40:41.505
TOO MUCH.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.574
>> TAKE A LOOK AT A BEAUTIFUL

40:43.641 --> 40:46.911
SKYLINE HERE AND A BEAUTIFUL SKY

40:46.977 --> 40:49.380
ON THIS CINCO de MAYO.

40:49.446 --> 40:49.980
>> CINCO de MAYO TOMORROW

40:50.047 --> 40:51.816
SHOULD START WITH SON.

40:51.882 --> 40:57.321
A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE, EL

40:57.388 --> 40:57.488
SOL.

40:57.555 --> 41:00.991
>> CINCO de MAYO, I THINK WE

41:01.058 --> 41:01.992
HOLD O OFF THE RAIN.

41:02.059 --> 41:07.798
>> IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD ON THIS

41:07.865 --> 41:09.099
CINCO de MAYO.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.302
IT WILL BE

41:11.368 --> 41:18.709
>> A LITTLE FIESTA AND THEN A

41:18.776 --> 41:20.244
QUICK SIESTA.

41:24.081 --> 41:25.182
>> WHAT LANGUAGE WAS THAT?

41:25.249 --> 41:28.152
>> I SAID THE SKY IS PARTLY

41:28.219 --> 41:32.089
CLOUDY AND MOSTLY CLOUDY.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.892
>> HERE IS JULIA WITH YOUR --

41:37.962 --> 41:38.629
>> THAT'S OUR SHOW.

41:38.696 --> 41:39.530
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

41:39.597 --> 41:40.397
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

41:40.464 --> 41:41.465
GOOD NIGHT!
