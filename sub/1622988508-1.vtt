<i>You're a news producer
on the outside.</i>

01:46.054 --> 01:49.547
Open your mouth. I'm a news junkie.

01:49.658 --> 01:54.289
And about 70, 80% of what I see
is total biased bullshit.

01:54.363 --> 01:56.832
Sometimes obvious bullshit.

01:56.899 --> 02:02.099
Sometimes nuanced,
sometimes brazen bullshit.

02:02.204 --> 02:04.696
<i>♪ Lings, the red-nosed reindeer ♪</i>

02:04.773 --> 02:09.233
Are you gonna sling
your brazen nuanced bullshit at me?

02:09.344 --> 02:11.836
'Cause if you do,

02:11.914 --> 02:14.349
I'm gonna go obvious on your ass.

02:14.416 --> 02:19.877
Like stick my baton sideways
up your buttocks obvious.

02:22.424 --> 02:23.585
Now bend over.

02:24.660 --> 02:27.027
Bend down.
What do you think?

02:27.095 --> 02:28.460
Full body-search?

02:28.564 --> 02:30.862
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.367
Okay, stand up.

02:34.903 --> 02:37.372
You're gonna share a cell with Frenchie.

02:38.540 --> 02:40.065
Give him his wardrobe.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.089
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

03:06.468 --> 03:07.731
Yo, I'm Frank.

03:15.043 --> 03:16.442
Hey, I'm Ayman.

03:17.446 --> 03:19.141
Sorry I didn't answer.

03:19.247 --> 03:21.477
I was just doing my prayer.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.984
So tell me something.
Ayman, right?

03:24.086 --> 03:26.145
What do you pray to your God for?

03:26.254 --> 03:27.483
Like, why do you do that?

03:27.589 --> 03:29.455
- Why?
- Yes. I'm asking why.

03:30.459 --> 03:32.450
Many reason.

03:32.527 --> 03:34.621
I pray to God five times a day

03:34.696 --> 03:38.360
as an expression of my gratitude
to him for what he granted me.

03:38.467 --> 03:41.596
Gratitude for what?
For this... this cage?

03:41.670 --> 03:43.160
You're right, I guess.

03:44.206 --> 03:47.267
But what if it was his plan?

03:47.342 --> 03:49.140
We all need fixing, right?

03:49.244 --> 03:50.643
The bars...

03:52.414 --> 03:54.007
that might fix.

03:54.116 --> 03:56.847
Prison, it don't make you a better person.

03:56.952 --> 03:59.614
No. No, just prison.

04:04.192 --> 04:07.389
I don't understand how this
can happen in our day and age.

04:07.496 --> 04:08.622
Twenty years?

04:08.697 --> 04:10.529
I'm not going to let that happen.

04:10.632 --> 04:14.296
Local Arab authorities said
that they found evidence of a struggle,

04:14.369 --> 04:16.463
hence the second degree murder charge,

04:16.538 --> 04:19.132
but they couldn't provide us
with any report about a firearm.

04:19.207 --> 04:21.197
'Cause I didn't do anything wrong.

04:21.309 --> 04:24.677
<i>The judge here was very hasty
to proceed with your indictment.</i>

04:24.780 --> 04:25.770
<i>I don't know why.</i>

04:25.847 --> 04:26.678
Excuse me.

04:26.782 --> 04:28.841
Electoral periods are over.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.442
I need a new trial, I can't stay here.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.818
Trust me, I'm working on it.

04:33.889 --> 04:35.721
I'll do whatever it takes.

04:35.824 --> 04:38.759
I'm glad I can get you back to the States
just after a few weeks.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.022
I had to pull some strings to prove

04:41.096 --> 04:44.066
you were going to face
inhumane prison conditions there.

04:44.166 --> 04:47.830
- Yeah, like prison's real humane here.
- I'm sorry, Frank. I really am.

04:47.903 --> 04:50.065
I don't need your sympathy, okay?
Just get me out of here.

04:55.711 --> 04:57.475
Let's go, guys!

04:57.546 --> 04:59.537
Give it some heart, fellas!

05:00.716 --> 05:03.447
Yeah, job security.
That's what I like to see.

05:09.725 --> 05:13.423
Hey, I'm not really sure how this works.
Kinda new here.

05:16.732 --> 05:18.200
Everybody's new for a minute.

05:20.936 --> 05:23.837
- You got a name?
- Frank.

05:26.374 --> 05:27.933
Frank, your minute's up.

05:30.912 --> 05:32.880
Listen, uh, Frank.

05:32.948 --> 05:35.383
Let's keep this real simple, okay?

05:35.450 --> 05:38.750
As long as you ain't a... a nigger,

05:38.820 --> 05:44.259
a Jew, a spic or a faggot
then you're okay with us.

05:44.326 --> 05:45.623
What do I look like?

05:45.727 --> 05:47.627
I get who you are.

05:47.729 --> 05:51.188
Brother, you just keep your mouth shut
and your ass tight.

05:51.266 --> 05:54.429
And from this second on,
anything you're asked to do,

05:54.536 --> 05:56.630
you do it or your lights go out.

06:07.349 --> 06:08.578
Fuckers.

06:08.650 --> 06:11.244
My leg's hurting today and my back.

06:14.956 --> 06:16.424
Pump that ganja in there.

06:17.993 --> 06:21.486
That's good.
That's all I need from the Rastas.

06:24.633 --> 06:28.570
No, no, I don't need any blimpy air today.

06:28.637 --> 06:30.503
Well, what have we got here?

06:31.606 --> 06:34.507
The homoerotic club in mass.

06:34.609 --> 06:37.704
<i>Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq,
six, sept, huit, neuf, dix.</i>

06:40.048 --> 06:42.483
Ho... ho.

06:42.551 --> 06:43.848
Frenchie.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.985
It's been a while, man.

06:54.429 --> 06:56.124
You need something?

06:58.934 --> 07:00.265
Do I need something?

07:01.269 --> 07:02.703
Yeah, I need something.

07:04.172 --> 07:07.540
Look at your...
Look at your pretty white ass.

07:07.642 --> 07:10.737
You ain't got a scar
or a scratch on you, huh?

07:10.846 --> 07:12.814
Just keep doing what you're told,

07:12.881 --> 07:17.375
and we'll make sure when you leave,
you look the same way.

07:17.485 --> 07:18.577
Now.

07:20.055 --> 07:22.217
We got a chain of command down, okay?

07:22.324 --> 07:24.884
Those that gives the orders
and those that take the orders.

07:24.993 --> 07:27.985
Now if you want to move up
the chain of command,

07:28.063 --> 07:30.395
you do a good piece of work
now and then.

07:30.498 --> 07:33.468
Otherwise, just stay where you are.

07:33.535 --> 07:34.366
But...

07:36.805 --> 07:41.003
if you're told to do something,
you don't have a choice.

07:44.379 --> 07:45.744
Do you feel me?

07:47.415 --> 07:48.678
I don't hear you.

07:49.684 --> 07:50.879
I got you.

07:52.354 --> 07:54.823
And that good looking mother
of yours, Susan?

07:57.893 --> 08:00.191
She won't be so good-looking no more.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.321
So you just do what you gotta do.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.994
You gotta get some ink on your ass
so these fucking niggers leave you alone.

08:09.070 --> 08:12.040
So they know who you belong to.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.031
I don't need tats.

08:14.109 --> 08:17.044
Look at you.
You got tits like a fucking broad.

08:17.112 --> 08:19.604
You look like
a fucking walking cheesecake.

08:19.714 --> 08:21.648
Tomorrow I want you to hit
the weight pile with Smitty

08:21.750 --> 08:25.243
and put some muscle
on that flaky ass of yours.

08:25.353 --> 08:28.516
Huh? I like my boys hard, all right?

08:28.590 --> 08:31.685
I like 'em tough, and I like 'em hard.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.626
You feel me? Hm?

08:34.729 --> 08:36.288
But first of all,
I want you to do me a favor.

08:36.398 --> 08:40.096
You hold onto this, stick this up your ass
and keep it there till I need it.

08:40.201 --> 08:41.965
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:43.772 --> 08:46.798
Oh, what do we got here?
It's the invasion of the towelheads.

08:46.908 --> 08:48.842
You meet my Saudi friends, huh?

08:49.844 --> 08:51.676
<i>Allahu Akbar,</i> boys.

08:52.681 --> 08:55.651
He's with me. See you later.

08:57.018 --> 08:58.247
What do you want from me?

08:58.320 --> 09:01.187
Nothing. It was Frenchie's idea.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.823
<i>This call
is being recorded. Please wait.</i>

09:14.169 --> 09:15.102
Bobby.

09:15.170 --> 09:16.763
Jeez.

09:16.838 --> 09:20.468
It's so good to hear from you, man.
Oh, wow, I...

09:20.575 --> 09:22.100
I was wondering when you
were going to talk.

09:22.177 --> 09:23.474
<i>Are you okay?</i>

09:23.578 --> 09:26.240
As much as someone
can be in my situation.

09:26.314 --> 09:28.146
God, this is terrible. I'm so sorry.

09:28.249 --> 09:31.116
<i>I mean, I don't even understand.</i>

09:31.186 --> 09:33.985
The last time I heard from you
you were on a trip with Sarah.

09:34.089 --> 09:35.454
<i>I know.</i>

09:35.523 --> 09:37.855
It's beyond... It's beyond crazy.

09:37.959 --> 09:40.451
Yeah, but I mean, what the hell happened
over there? What is this bullshit?

09:40.528 --> 09:42.826
- You don't think I did it?
- <i>Fuck no!</i>

09:42.931 --> 09:46.333
Frank, when you started
in the mailroom ten years ago,

09:46.401 --> 09:48.369
what did I tell you about our job?

09:48.470 --> 09:50.404
Never trust the police,

09:50.505 --> 09:52.371
<i>especially in a foreign government.</i>

09:52.474 --> 09:54.875
It's a long... it's a long story.

09:54.976 --> 09:57.411
<i>You know I would never
lay a hand on her, right?</i>

09:57.512 --> 10:01.210
But right now is not the time.
I... I need your help.

10:01.316 --> 10:02.306
Tell me.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.819
<i>There's something off
about this whole case.</i>

10:04.886 --> 10:08.345
My lawyer said there were discrepancies
used in the procedures to deport me here.

10:08.423 --> 10:10.687
This judge, Jude Wilson,
he's a state judge.

10:10.759 --> 10:12.318
But I don't know
what the fuck his problem is.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.691
It's like he's got it out for me.

10:13.762 --> 10:15.355
You think the judge fucked you up?

10:15.463 --> 10:17.227
- I'm not saying...
- I hate you!

10:18.800 --> 10:21.963
Look, I don't know what's going on,
but you are the best journalist I know,

10:22.037 --> 10:23.505
and you're the only man
I can trust right now.

10:23.571 --> 10:26.063
So please, I need your help.
Just find out what you can.

10:26.174 --> 10:28.472
Of course, man.
I'll do some research.

10:28.543 --> 10:30.170
<i>Hey, just...</i>

10:30.245 --> 10:34.375
Just... don't get in any trouble, okay?

10:34.482 --> 10:38.009
Look, I gotta go.
You are the man, okay? Thank you.

10:38.086 --> 10:39.076
I'll talk to you later.

10:59.140 --> 11:01.632
- Hey, about this afternoon.
- Thank you.

11:16.091 --> 11:18.719
The point is, you're supposed to practice
speaking foreign language,

11:18.793 --> 11:20.124
you know, to refresh your memory?

11:22.297 --> 11:23.526
Yeah, that's the one.

11:23.598 --> 11:24.759
She swears by it.

11:24.866 --> 11:26.595
Says that's how she learned her English.

11:28.136 --> 11:30.195
No, that's the point.

11:30.271 --> 11:33.366
Her English was terrible.
I could hardly understand a thing.

11:33.441 --> 11:34.431
Uh, hold on one sec.

11:34.542 --> 11:35.703
Can I have an eclair, please?

11:35.777 --> 11:37.472
- Okay.
- To go.

11:37.579 --> 11:41.982
Uh, you could say
she was a D student. Double D.

11:43.051 --> 11:45.418
Anyway, I'll call you back, man.

11:46.921 --> 11:49.083
- That's for you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.587
Oops.

11:53.661 --> 11:55.959
Wow.

11:57.298 --> 11:59.289
- Thank you, Frank.
- Nice dress.

11:59.367 --> 12:00.630
Oh, what'd you call me?

12:00.702 --> 12:02.363
That's your name, right?

12:02.470 --> 12:04.837
- Have we met before?
- Your name tag.

12:09.878 --> 12:13.109
Wow. I learned some French
a while back.

12:13.181 --> 12:14.342
I love languages.

12:14.449 --> 12:17.851
I'm more fluent in Arabic, though.
I'm actually from the region.

12:17.952 --> 12:21.183
Aha. And... you're a teacher?

12:21.289 --> 12:22.984
No, it's more food-related.

12:23.091 --> 12:25.287
- You cook?
- Yeah. Middle Eastern cuisine.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.328
Oh, delicious.

12:27.428 --> 12:32.161
So I actually don't know
any Arabic except for <i>habibi.</i>

12:32.267 --> 12:34.201
Yes, but if you want to call me honey,

12:34.302 --> 12:36.361
the correct word is <i>habibti.</i>

12:36.471 --> 12:40.203
But you can start with Sarah, though.

12:40.308 --> 12:41.776
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Sarah.

12:41.843 --> 12:45.711
I'm Frank, and I must say
I love the way Arabic sounds.

12:45.813 --> 12:50.341
In fact, I was in Egypt, covering
the revolution a few years ago and...

12:50.451 --> 12:51.885
- Your to go.
- That's me.

12:51.986 --> 12:53.511
- Give me one second.
- Okay.

12:54.522 --> 12:55.353
Thank you.

12:56.724 --> 12:58.214
Frank, this is my sister Deana.

12:58.326 --> 12:59.816
- Uh-oh.
- So you are the reason

12:59.894 --> 13:01.658
I've been waiting for my food for ages?

13:01.729 --> 13:03.026
Your sister is lovely, Sarah.

13:03.097 --> 13:05.395
Mm, sarcastic, I like that.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.899
Yeah, and he's charming.

13:07.001 --> 13:09.436
- You know, I can very easily...
- No, no, no.

13:09.537 --> 13:11.767
I wouldn't want you to be late to, uh,

13:11.873 --> 13:14.604
that, um, double D girlfriend of yours,

13:14.709 --> 13:17.872
but it was a pleasure
meeting you, Frank.

13:17.946 --> 13:19.277
Bye-bye.

13:24.819 --> 13:26.719
I'm starving.

13:26.821 --> 13:28.311
I'll tell you what.

13:28.389 --> 13:30.653
I'm sure my imaginary girlfriend
wouldn't mind

13:30.725 --> 13:34.684
if you use that pen I saved for you
to give me your number.

13:34.762 --> 13:37.197
I'll give you a little assignment, though.

13:37.265 --> 13:39.563
You said you
liked the way Arabic sounds.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.762
So I'm gonna give you
a little translation exercise.

13:42.870 --> 13:45.202
And be careful,

13:45.273 --> 13:50.404
'cause I will know if you didn't bother
finding out the meaning of that.

13:50.511 --> 13:51.910
I knew you could be a teacher.

13:52.013 --> 13:53.572
Good night.

13:55.283 --> 13:59.117
No, the bakery down the street.
Goddammit, where did I put this thing?

13:59.220 --> 14:02.815
- So how was the sister?
- Look, they're both hot.

14:02.924 --> 14:04.323
Middle Eastern chicks.
You should know.

14:04.425 --> 14:06.792
Damn, man. I should've been there.

14:06.894 --> 14:09.158
Arab chicks? I don't think
I've actually ever hit that.

14:09.264 --> 14:12.757
Wait, no, except for the girl who I dated
whose dad was from Iran.

14:12.834 --> 14:16.065
Persian, Arab is a different world.

14:16.137 --> 14:19.107
- <i>Which we publish online.</i>
- <i>We use the word of God...</i>

14:19.173 --> 14:20.504
God, I can't believe this disappeared!

14:20.608 --> 14:21.598
Wait-wait a minute.

14:23.645 --> 14:27.275
What is... what is this
over here, Mr. Frank?

14:27.382 --> 14:29.783
- Ooh!
- Thank you.

14:29.884 --> 14:33.878
Look, she, uh... she wrote in Arabic
so I have to translate it.

14:33.955 --> 14:35.445
Oh, she's already
playing games with you.

14:35.556 --> 14:37.251
Man, I hate that.
You're not gonna do it, right?

14:37.325 --> 14:39.987
Yeah, of course. I mean, Google.

14:40.094 --> 14:44.429
Oh, man. She has cast
a fucking spell on you, dude.

14:44.499 --> 14:46.331
<i>♪ Yeah, I cast a spell on you ♪</i>

14:46.434 --> 14:48.630
<i>♪ And now you're mine ♪</i>

15:16.164 --> 15:17.689
Thank you.

15:17.799 --> 15:20.029
I gotta give you props
for finding this place.

15:20.134 --> 15:21.898
You have very good taste.

15:22.003 --> 15:23.732
I do, don't I?

15:23.838 --> 15:25.237
No, but seriously, I love it.

15:25.340 --> 15:27.104
It reminds me of, like,
an '80s disco in here.

15:27.175 --> 15:30.475
Mean, they've got Alston Koch,
Asia's King of pop.

15:30.545 --> 15:33.674
What, do you know all this because you're
some sort of paparazzi or...

15:33.781 --> 15:36.113
No, I come here for the margaritas, okay?

15:36.184 --> 15:38.312
They are world class. You should try one.

15:38.386 --> 15:41.117
I wouldn't be able to compare.
I've never had one.

15:41.189 --> 15:42.850
Like, you're allergic, or...?

15:42.957 --> 15:46.450
No, I'm-I'm Muslim.

15:46.527 --> 15:49.360
Right. So I never asked you,
what country are you from?

15:49.464 --> 15:52.991
I'm from the country
of <i>One Thousand and One Nights.</i>

15:54.001 --> 15:55.662
Sounds very exotic.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.068
I'm used to life here, though.

15:57.171 --> 16:00.266
I moved here when I was just a kid
with my older sister, Deana.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.241
My parents were getting divorced,

16:02.343 --> 16:04.835
and they wanted me to have a better life.

16:04.912 --> 16:09.543
So, I mean, she's taken care
of me like a second... mother.

16:14.455 --> 16:20.724
So I'm sure you're familiar
with Umm Kulthum or Abdel Halim Hafez?

16:20.795 --> 16:23.628
They played their music
all the time when I was in Egypt.

16:23.731 --> 16:26.359
You sound very knowledgeable.

16:26.434 --> 16:28.732
Um, are you okay?

16:28.836 --> 16:31.271
I'm sure that would impress
many Arab girls,

16:31.372 --> 16:34.273
but that's not your plan at all, is it?

16:34.375 --> 16:37.003
Okay, I admit it. I did a little homework
to refresh my memory.

16:37.078 --> 16:38.671
See?

16:38.746 --> 16:41.875
Don't worry,
I'll still give you an A-minus.

16:41.949 --> 16:44.850
- An A-minus?
- Mm-hmm.

16:44.919 --> 16:47.718
Good thing I have
something else in mind to get an A-plus.

16:56.464 --> 16:57.863
Back straight. Okay.

16:58.866 --> 17:00.994
Back. Forward.

17:02.003 --> 17:02.936
Slide.

17:06.741 --> 17:10.108
Okay, my turn. Follow my lead.

17:15.916 --> 17:18.750
Move your hips a little more.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.151
You're doing great!

17:53.354 --> 17:54.617
Ayman.

18:05.199 --> 18:08.567
I hear you got a new cellmate. How is he?

18:09.570 --> 18:10.901
Pretty good looking.

18:11.973 --> 18:15.500
I'd say he was a ten, but with prison,
he must be a seven now.

18:16.811 --> 18:18.506
What do you want from him, Saud?

18:18.579 --> 18:21.810
Nothing, that's my point.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.716
I don't want him
anywhere near our business.

18:24.819 --> 18:26.514
I know how to recognize a good person.

18:26.587 --> 18:30.820
Have you ever dealt with the FBI?
You ever been interrogated? Huh?

18:30.892 --> 18:32.883
You don't know anything.

18:32.994 --> 18:36.453
You know, the saddest thing about betrayal

18:36.531 --> 18:39.000
is that it never comes from your enemy.

18:40.301 --> 18:42.292
You're so naive, Ayman.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.168
I've got nothing to hide, Saud.

18:44.238 --> 18:47.333
You think they care about that?

18:47.408 --> 18:49.069
Let me show you something.

18:58.152 --> 19:00.644
When you think of torture,
what do you think of?

19:00.721 --> 19:03.747
Blades, knives.

19:03.858 --> 19:06.350
Pulled teeth, right?

19:06.427 --> 19:08.361
Beatings are obsolete, brother.

19:08.429 --> 19:11.421
Slipping into madness.

19:11.532 --> 19:14.763
This noise, now that's quite different.

19:14.869 --> 19:19.534
Because they know
that we can anticipate physical pain.

19:19.607 --> 19:21.234
But the torture of this noise,

19:21.309 --> 19:26.907
blazing in your ear
hour after hour, even days.

19:31.252 --> 19:36.281
They have the slightest inclination
that you got information,

19:36.390 --> 19:39.917
they will do you
the same as they did me.

19:40.027 --> 19:43.395
God will protect me.

19:43.464 --> 19:48.061
Ayman, I'm coordinating this job
with the outside,

19:48.135 --> 19:51.571
and I need a brother that I can trust.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.369
I know about your past.

19:55.543 --> 19:58.376
Thanks. But no thanks.

19:59.747 --> 20:02.739
Ayman, I'm gonna protect your protégé,

20:02.817 --> 20:04.376
but if he becomes a threat...

20:05.953 --> 20:06.943
I'll get rid of him.

20:14.161 --> 20:18.462
Ooh, I'm overstimulated, gentlemen.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.262
Ahh...

20:22.269 --> 20:23.828
Oh, this one's for you.

20:23.938 --> 20:25.929
Some Bobby.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.998
What's that, your lover or something?

20:28.109 --> 20:30.476
What's the matter, Frenchie?

20:30.544 --> 20:32.444
Don't you want your letters?

20:33.514 --> 20:36.506
<i>Je t'aime. J'adore.</i>

20:36.617 --> 20:38.585
It's so hot.

20:38.653 --> 20:41.987
I saw that little girl in her red dress
and her dark glasses.

20:42.089 --> 20:44.148
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:44.258 --> 20:45.657
There you go.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.786
Perfume, just like her pussy.

20:48.863 --> 20:52.094
Somebody's stretching that
while you're in here.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.032
Might as well... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:54.135 --> 20:56.194
Might as well be Louis.

20:56.303 --> 21:00.103
Don't worry, ram-a-dam-a-ding-dong!
I'll get her for you.

21:01.275 --> 21:04.836
We're gonna get your mind right.
Come on, you want it.

21:04.945 --> 21:05.935
Come on, ah!

21:06.981 --> 21:07.971
Whoa!

21:12.920 --> 21:14.513
I brought you a little culinary delights.

21:14.588 --> 21:17.216
I know how you French are
about your cuisine.

21:17.324 --> 21:23.161
You can dream about the food just like you
dream about the letters <i>d'amour.</i>

21:23.230 --> 21:26.063
Don't worry, I'll free my pelvis
before I fuck her.

21:27.268 --> 21:30.033
<i>Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.</i>

21:33.107 --> 21:34.541
What the hell was that?

21:34.608 --> 21:38.101
Mail distribution. Can't you tell?

21:38.212 --> 21:40.874
Um, what'd you do to him?

21:40.981 --> 21:42.244
I slept with his mom.

21:43.984 --> 21:47.420
People don't need a reason to hate you.
They just do.

21:47.521 --> 21:50.547
Man is really good at that.

21:50.658 --> 21:54.754
- So he picks on all you guys?
- Not all of us.

21:54.862 --> 21:58.492
He still wants to start his car
without getting blown up.

21:58.566 --> 22:00.762
- You know what I mean?
- Are you serious?

22:00.868 --> 22:02.734
Your bearded friends are that dangerous?

22:02.837 --> 22:04.532
Terrorist network.

22:04.605 --> 22:08.337
Those guys may be in jail,
but they are still in charge.

22:13.948 --> 22:15.109
And what about you?

22:16.751 --> 22:19.652
Why do you think that prick
can have a field day with me?

22:19.754 --> 22:21.222
He know I have no connection outside.

22:21.288 --> 22:24.121
No family, friends?

22:24.225 --> 22:27.058
No, not anymore.

22:27.128 --> 22:30.154
And these crazy bearded
are very dangerous.

22:30.264 --> 22:32.756
And, no, I'm not a part of them.

22:33.768 --> 22:36.066
It's a prison here.

22:36.137 --> 22:39.266
I stay with them because I don't
have no fucking choice to save my ass.

22:40.508 --> 22:41.669
But I hate them.

22:41.776 --> 22:46.043
I hate them for what they did
to us, to Islam.

22:48.482 --> 22:52.885
How come they said
it was your idea to help me?

22:52.953 --> 22:56.082
Frank, I saw you getting into trouble,

22:56.157 --> 23:01.618
but something told me you don't want
to join the fucking ABO Low Riders.

23:01.729 --> 23:03.390
I hope I made the right decision.

23:03.464 --> 23:06.957
Now whether you want it or not,

23:07.067 --> 23:10.901
you are part of our... gang.

23:15.442 --> 23:16.841
Such a long day.

23:16.944 --> 23:18.673
Can't wait to get in my bed.

23:21.282 --> 23:23.216
Anything exciting?

23:24.451 --> 23:28.445
No. I think I need to take on
more night shifts, though.

23:29.523 --> 23:31.457
I'm strapped for cash.

23:31.525 --> 23:33.789
It's getting tight with the kid coming.

23:33.861 --> 23:38.162
Well, hell, I'm not gonna complain that
somebody wants to keep me company.

23:38.232 --> 23:40.030
Might as well be you.

23:40.134 --> 23:43.195
This job is fucking killing me.

23:47.308 --> 23:50.539
- Whose letter is that this time?
- Brooks.

23:50.644 --> 23:54.478
But those Hajjis, all the same.
They're the worst.

23:54.548 --> 23:56.209
Doesn't it bother you?

23:56.317 --> 23:58.183
I don't know, what'd they do?

23:58.285 --> 24:00.879
I don't know, it just pisses me off

24:00.988 --> 24:03.150
them going to prayers every day.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.454
What about the other inmates?
Don't they get to use that room?

24:05.526 --> 24:08.052
And-and what if they're
planning something in there?

24:08.162 --> 24:09.391
Oh, and let the pricks pray.

24:09.496 --> 24:11.555
Their god ain't listening to them anyway.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.290
I just don't like it.

24:14.368 --> 24:18.862
Well, as long as they don't take the bacon
out of our cafeteria,

24:18.939 --> 24:22.102
- I'm fine with it.
- The hell they will.

24:31.352 --> 24:33.514
I need a ball porter.

24:36.357 --> 24:40.225
I need a ball porter.
You got some beans on my ball.

24:45.266 --> 24:48.258
- Who's my friend?
- We are!

24:48.369 --> 24:51.168
- Who's my friend?
- We are!

24:52.406 --> 24:53.874
You guys mind if I join you?

24:55.242 --> 24:56.505
No, brother.

24:58.178 --> 25:01.170
- I'm Saud.
- Frank.

25:02.182 --> 25:04.173
You are Ayman's cellmate, right?

25:04.251 --> 25:05.548
Yeah, he told me to sit with you guys.

25:05.619 --> 25:07.087
You know where he is?

25:14.728 --> 25:16.560
Louis.

25:16.630 --> 25:19.327
- What's shaking, baby?
- Gary.

25:19.433 --> 25:21.162
How's the pain in the leg?

25:21.268 --> 25:22.565
- Ever present.
- Oh, yeah?

25:23.971 --> 25:25.939
I got a little gift for you.

25:27.574 --> 25:29.838
This'll help with the pain.

25:29.944 --> 25:33.005
Hey, this is some good shit.
Hey, ain't been stepped on.

25:34.481 --> 25:36.643
You want another bag, just whistle.

25:36.750 --> 25:37.979
Thank you.

25:44.992 --> 25:46.460
Hey, Frank.

25:46.527 --> 25:48.325
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

25:50.931 --> 25:53.798
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
slit your throat right now.

25:53.901 --> 25:56.802
- What'd I do?
- That's what I'm gonna try and find out.

25:56.904 --> 25:58.338
I knew I couldn't trust you,

25:58.439 --> 26:01.409
and a little research
from my side proved me right.

26:01.475 --> 26:03.136
What are you talking about?

26:03.243 --> 26:07.510
You got five seconds, five seconds,
to tell me why you killed one of ours.

26:08.916 --> 26:10.315
Sarah?

26:10.417 --> 26:11.748
Our sister.

26:11.819 --> 26:13.947
You don't understand.
Sarah was my...

26:14.021 --> 26:15.580
She was my wife, man.

26:15.656 --> 26:19.593
And you thought you can get away with it
if you killed her in her homeland?

26:19.660 --> 26:20.991
Fuck, I didn't kill her, I swear to God...

26:21.061 --> 26:24.656
Shut up! You ain't in court now.

26:24.732 --> 26:28.134
You shed our blood, we shed yours.

26:28.202 --> 26:30.967
You know what? Then fuck you, huh?
Fuck you and your people!

26:31.038 --> 26:32.563
You're the fucking reason for this, huh?

26:32.673 --> 26:34.198
Sarah was
the most precious thing that I had,

26:34.308 --> 26:37.573
and I would do anything for her,
anything to get her back.

26:37.678 --> 26:39.646
You think I'm responsible? Huh?

26:39.713 --> 26:42.205
Then go on! Go on, do it!

26:42.316 --> 26:44.717
Kill me, just like you killed her!

26:52.326 --> 26:55.227
Maybe Ayman was right this time.

28:05.699 --> 28:07.758
Twelve o'clock!

28:53.180 --> 28:54.545
You got ten minutes.

28:54.648 --> 28:56.980
- Hey.
- I saw her yesterday.

28:57.084 --> 28:59.519
- Who?
- This is absolutely nuts.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.748
This guy seems rotten to the core.

29:01.822 --> 29:02.687
What do you mean?

29:02.789 --> 29:05.781
<i>So I've been looking into
this guy's cases on his dockets</i>

29:05.859 --> 29:07.588
<i>for the last maybe three years.</i>

29:07.661 --> 29:09.857
<i>Checked in with every attorney
that I know.</i>

29:09.963 --> 29:13.991
<i>See if they found anything about this guy
and this guy is squeaky clean, man.</i>

29:14.101 --> 29:15.865
I can't find anything.

29:15.969 --> 29:18.870
So I figure it's time
to think outside the box.

29:18.972 --> 29:21.703
<i>Let's check into his reelection
campaign donors.</i>

29:21.808 --> 29:24.038
<i>It's publicly available.</i>

29:24.144 --> 29:26.841
And it seems like he's got
a lot of strong ties to the Gulf.

29:26.947 --> 29:28.711
A lot of his investors
are from the region.

29:28.815 --> 29:31.910
Yeah, so what? I mean, nothing new.
Everyone's after their money.

29:32.019 --> 29:35.250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but hold on.
I went to investigate.

29:35.355 --> 29:37.915
Just ask for me.
Go and ask, just five minutes.

29:38.025 --> 29:40.153
That's all, that's all I'm asking.

29:40.227 --> 29:43.253
Okay, I see what I can do.

29:43.363 --> 29:44.694
<i>Checked out from his office,</i>

29:44.765 --> 29:48.099
<i>found out that he was actually
on a business trip to the region.</i>

29:48.202 --> 29:50.364
So I call up my guy at the BCJI, right?

29:50.437 --> 29:52.235
- Rocket intelligence?
- Yeah.

29:52.339 --> 29:53.704
- All right, they're solid.
- Yeah.

29:53.774 --> 29:56.539
They've got a lot of information
on foreign countries in the area,

29:56.610 --> 29:58.669
a lot of intel, especially in the Gulf.

29:58.745 --> 30:01.976
I find out from him that our judge guy

30:02.049 --> 30:05.019
<i>was actually talking
to the Vice Prime Minister</i>

30:05.085 --> 30:06.814
<i>and other executives over there.</i>

30:06.887 --> 30:08.252
So I managed to find out, right,

30:08.355 --> 30:10.346
some of the names in the newspapers,

30:10.424 --> 30:12.654
'cause it makes some of the headlines
of the local news.

30:12.726 --> 30:14.660
This is the part
where it gets interesting.

30:14.728 --> 30:18.722
One of the names was none other
than the CEO of Etagi.

30:18.832 --> 30:20.027
Name sounds familiar, right?

30:20.100 --> 30:21.568
Yeah, we've seen it in the news.

30:21.668 --> 30:23.693
Yeah, they just won one
of the biggest contracts

30:23.770 --> 30:26.705
for an oil development project
just off the coast of Virginia.

30:26.773 --> 30:28.537
A multimillion dollar project.

30:28.609 --> 30:29.906
Okay, what's the link to our judge?

30:30.010 --> 30:31.774
So I managed to get a copy

30:31.878 --> 30:34.279
<i>of this big oil company's
investment portfolio, right?</i>

30:34.381 --> 30:37.749
<i>What struck me was this small local
American business</i>

30:37.818 --> 30:40.788
<i>that seems to benefit quite considerably
from their money.</i>

30:40.887 --> 30:42.548
<i>Guess who owns the business</i>

30:42.623 --> 30:44.751
and whom I saw leaving
this very same country block,

30:44.825 --> 30:48.887
where coincidentally our CEO
from the Middle East

30:48.962 --> 30:50.225
happens to be staying at?

30:50.297 --> 30:52.288
Someone close to the judge?

30:52.399 --> 30:55.164
<i>Andrea Brown,
or let me give you a hint.</i>

30:55.269 --> 30:56.737
<i>Brown is her maiden name.</i>

30:56.803 --> 30:59.397
- I don't get it.
- The judge's wife.

30:59.473 --> 31:00.963
Get the fuck outta here.

31:01.074 --> 31:03.941
Man, this is way bigger
than we first expected.

31:04.044 --> 31:05.876
This judge uses his clout
to safeguard

31:05.946 --> 31:09.974
<i>contracts for these guys in...
in the Gulf.</i>

31:10.083 --> 31:14.645
<i>And they, in return,
pay his family most handsomely.</i>

31:14.755 --> 31:17.315
What the fu... What does that have to do
with my case, though?

31:18.325 --> 31:20.054
I haven't figured that part out yet,

31:20.127 --> 31:22.061
but, I mean, this guy is corrupt.

31:22.129 --> 31:23.927
<i>At the very least
he should've recused himself</i>

31:23.997 --> 31:25.487
<i>for a conflict of interest
in the case, right?</i>

31:25.599 --> 31:28.432
Don't worry, man.
I'm writing a huge exposé.

31:28.502 --> 31:30.834
<i>This is gonna blow this out of the water.</i>

31:30.937 --> 31:32.496
This might get you the Pulitzer.

31:32.606 --> 31:35.541
Man, I wouldn't want to say to them
better looking and smarter,

31:35.642 --> 31:38.270
but if you wanted to say it,
I'd be okay with it.

31:39.313 --> 31:41.111
Two minutes.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.617
We're gonna get you outta here,
okay, man?

31:55.162 --> 31:57.654
<i>Look, I'm meeting
with your attorney this week</i>

31:57.731 --> 32:01.224
to discuss how we can use this
in all of your appeal.

32:01.335 --> 32:02.803
This is huge.

32:16.983 --> 32:21.887
I came here because I know that they
record prison conversations on the phone.

32:21.988 --> 32:24.320
So that's why I wanted
to tell you this in person.

32:30.497 --> 32:32.295
Bobby, I don't know how to thank you.

32:32.366 --> 32:33.891
Just look after yourself, okay?

32:37.738 --> 32:38.603
Yeah.

32:42.075 --> 32:44.840
Hey, I'll be seeing you soon, buddy.

32:57.524 --> 32:58.923
I'll give you my...

32:59.025 --> 33:00.584
I'll give you my fucking gun!

33:03.230 --> 33:06.666
- Keep going, move it.
- What are you looking at, Lings?

33:06.733 --> 33:08.394
- Clear off.
- Move it.

33:08.502 --> 33:09.833
Let's go!

33:22.115 --> 33:23.605
You're not gonna tell me what happened?

33:25.051 --> 33:28.510
- It's none of your business.
- Man, I saw them.

33:28.588 --> 33:30.920
You can't let them do that to you.
You gotta do something about it.

33:31.958 --> 33:34.723
Oh, yeah. What do you suggest?

33:34.795 --> 33:36.263
I don't know, you could...

33:38.398 --> 33:39.729
That's right.

33:51.945 --> 33:53.413
Let me take a look at that.

33:56.016 --> 33:57.450
I need more fabric.

34:00.620 --> 34:03.521
So can I ask... Why you in here?

34:04.624 --> 34:07.116
I made some mistake. That's that.

34:07.194 --> 34:09.663
Frank, don't bring up the past like that.

34:09.763 --> 34:12.322
People are just focusing on
becoming a better person here.

34:12.431 --> 34:15.663
Better person?
You seen the gangs in this place?

34:15.768 --> 34:16.998
Most people are rotting here.

34:17.103 --> 34:18.628
Some need more work.

34:18.737 --> 34:20.831
I guess everybody can be saved.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.500
You sound like Jesus.

34:22.609 --> 34:24.270
Aren't you supposed to be Muslim?

34:24.344 --> 34:29.077
Muslim, Christians, Jewish,
all pray the same God.

34:29.149 --> 34:31.014
- Well, you better stop praying.
- Why do you...

34:34.654 --> 34:37.089
Get some ice on that
and get to the infirmary.

34:37.157 --> 34:38.955
And you learn this
behind your computer screen?

34:39.025 --> 34:41.652
Believe it or not,
I was a journalist.

34:41.728 --> 34:42.889
Picked up a few things in the field.

34:42.996 --> 34:45.192
And what about you, Ayman?
What's your story?

34:45.297 --> 34:47.062
Were you born a Muslim?

34:47.167 --> 34:49.659
You're starting
a prison newsletter or what?

34:53.005 --> 34:57.307
Well, a couple of years ago,
a lot of bad things happened to me.

34:58.812 --> 35:00.302
I lost my job...

35:04.017 --> 35:06.247
and somebody very dear to me.

35:07.387 --> 35:09.481
It started this whole quest.

35:09.556 --> 35:13.515
I want to believe, but I need the proof
of the existence of God.

35:13.627 --> 35:16.824
I explore all religion, except one.

35:17.831 --> 35:21.165
People ask me, "And Islam?"

35:21.234 --> 35:23.669
I will say, "They are terrorists."

35:23.737 --> 35:27.298
What are you, a fucking mute?
Look at me.

35:27.374 --> 35:28.671
Look at me!

35:28.742 --> 35:31.211
That's these words, my holy quest.

35:32.712 --> 35:35.977
I still somehow
ended up in the mosque.

35:36.049 --> 35:40.850
These guys, big beards,
came right to me.

35:41.855 --> 35:43.084
Very welcoming.

35:43.189 --> 35:45.351
- Who's my friend?
- We are.

35:45.425 --> 35:47.621
- Who's my friend?
- We are.

35:47.727 --> 35:53.029
I ask him everything
that came to my mind.

35:53.099 --> 35:56.967
And to answer, he will always
take the Qur'an and say,

35:57.070 --> 36:01.473
"Read this. Read this, my brother.”

36:01.575 --> 36:07.878
One night, I told, "I'm ready."

36:12.886 --> 36:16.686
I was there, silently reading the Qur'an.

36:17.691 --> 36:19.216
And I stopped.

36:19.292 --> 36:23.229
I said, "All I need
is just a little sign."

36:23.296 --> 36:24.627
And you know what happened?

36:24.731 --> 36:26.927
Where's Frank and Frenchie?

36:27.033 --> 36:30.367
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

36:31.371 --> 36:32.600
Where's Frank and Frenchie?

36:32.706 --> 36:36.108
I flipped back
exactly where I was stopped.

36:36.209 --> 36:39.474
And the first verse that I find was,

36:39.579 --> 36:43.072
"For those of you who ask for sign,

36:43.149 --> 36:45.618
we haven't show you enough already?

36:45.685 --> 36:47.779
Look around you.

36:47.854 --> 36:51.791
Look at the sky,
look at the stars, the water.

36:53.793 --> 36:56.490
They are sign for the people
with knowledge."

36:56.596 --> 36:59.293
Where the fuck
is Frenchie and Frank?!

36:59.366 --> 37:03.132
I was so scared, I hid under the blanket.

37:04.137 --> 37:06.629
This will be no sufficient proof
for most people,

37:06.706 --> 37:10.438
but to me it was enough.

37:13.179 --> 37:18.015
He showed me how arrogant I have been,
to want my own specific signs.

37:20.120 --> 37:23.488
The day after I become a Muslim.

37:26.092 --> 37:27.651
Hey!

37:30.597 --> 37:32.861
You two like to make me
go for a stroll.

37:33.867 --> 37:35.961
Hurry up.

37:36.036 --> 37:39.006
You keep stepping like that,
I'll put you in chains.

37:40.373 --> 37:42.364
Get back to work, Lings.

38:02.328 --> 38:04.660
Oh, my God, they're so cute.

38:04.731 --> 38:07.063
You know, when I was
a little bit younger than him,

38:07.167 --> 38:08.896
I was quite the ladies' man.

38:09.002 --> 38:10.993
Yeah? How so?

38:11.071 --> 38:13.369
So I used to crawl around the beach

38:13.440 --> 38:16.740
and head straight for the girls
laying on their bellies sunbathing.

38:16.843 --> 38:18.572
And I'd sneak up behind them
and spank 'em.

38:18.678 --> 38:20.646
Oh, my God!

38:20.714 --> 38:23.308
What about you? What was your childhood
like in the Middle East?

38:23.383 --> 38:26.182
I was happy.
My parents were very understanding

38:26.252 --> 38:27.742
<i>and open about things.</i>

38:27.854 --> 38:29.515
<i>Even all your college boyfriends?</i>

38:29.589 --> 38:32.388
<i>Boyfriends, no.
I said they were open about things.</i>

38:32.492 --> 38:33.891
<i>We're still Arab, you know.</i>

38:33.993 --> 38:35.358
<i>And what about you?</i>

38:35.428 --> 38:37.021
What about that four year old little boy?

38:37.097 --> 38:38.656
Once a player, always a player.

38:38.732 --> 38:40.700
No, not really.

38:40.767 --> 38:42.997
<i>I don't buy it. I bet you're a womanizer.</i>

38:43.069 --> 38:44.366
<i>You know, how do I know
you're not a player?</i>

38:44.437 --> 38:46.166
I mean, you played with me at first.

38:46.239 --> 38:49.072
For all I know you're a black widow
or a honeytrap.

38:49.142 --> 38:51.736
Maybe I am.

39:14.334 --> 39:15.426
Hm.

39:20.106 --> 39:20.937
Aha!

39:23.543 --> 39:24.977
Abracadabra!

39:25.078 --> 39:28.708
Look at you, going out of your way
to cook Moroccan food for me.

39:28.782 --> 39:30.409
Does that surprise you?

39:30.483 --> 39:32.952
Isn't it possible I already knew
how to cook tagine?

39:33.052 --> 39:36.113
- Come on.
- All right, I admit it.

39:36.222 --> 39:37.815
I looked it up a few days ago.

39:40.293 --> 39:41.488
Mm.

39:43.129 --> 39:45.564
Did you put...
Did you put turmeric in it?

39:45.632 --> 39:47.566
Yeah, the yellowish spice, right?

39:47.634 --> 39:49.625
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's fine.

39:49.736 --> 39:50.965
No, what-what do you mean?
What's wrong?

39:51.070 --> 39:54.597
- Nothing, it's nothing.
- Tell me.

39:54.674 --> 39:57.439
It's supposed to be saffron, not turmeric.

39:57.510 --> 39:59.308
But it's funny, it just tastes different.

39:59.379 --> 40:01.006
Dammit, I could have sworn
I got the right...

40:01.114 --> 40:03.105
No, don't worry. It's fine.
Actually, it's delicious.

40:03.183 --> 40:04.480
Don't say that.

40:04.551 --> 40:06.349
I'm serious, it is.

40:07.353 --> 40:09.219
I should just order pizza.

40:11.858 --> 40:14.486
Frank, I need to tell you something.

40:14.561 --> 40:19.294
You know that annoying girl that talks
about her boyfriend all the freaking time?

40:19.365 --> 40:20.992
That's me right now.

40:21.067 --> 40:22.660
You can ask Deana.

40:24.337 --> 40:28.171
Um... you know what?
I don't celebrate Christmas.

40:28.274 --> 40:30.106
So tell me, is your family gonna hate me?

40:30.176 --> 40:32.201
I mean, do you even see your family?

40:32.312 --> 40:34.178
Because I spent a lot of time
with my sister,

40:34.280 --> 40:36.374
and my parents, they mostly speak Arabic.

40:36.482 --> 40:40.646
So what if you can't understand
each other? How can they accept you?

40:40.720 --> 40:44.213
- I mean, I don't even know if you care.
- Sarah, calm down.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.989
I'm not going anywhere.

40:48.027 --> 40:49.017
Here.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.161
As for your mother,

40:52.232 --> 40:53.700
if she's anything like you,

40:53.766 --> 40:55.325
I can only get along with her.

40:55.401 --> 40:58.393
And if your parents don't speak English
then I'll learn Arabic.

40:59.839 --> 41:03.036
And if you guys don't celebrate Christmas,
then we'll get Chinese food.

41:03.109 --> 41:05.339
But I'm sure
my parents wouldn't mind

41:05.411 --> 41:07.709
adding a setting for you
at the dinner table.

41:07.780 --> 41:10.909
You said it yourself, I come prepared.

41:11.017 --> 41:12.883
And there's a reason for that.

41:23.529 --> 41:24.553
Wait, wait.

41:26.199 --> 41:28.759
I can't. I can't have sex with you.

41:31.004 --> 41:32.870
I've never done it before.

41:34.207 --> 41:35.936
Oh, my God, this is wrong.

41:36.943 --> 41:38.672
I shouldn't do this.

41:38.745 --> 41:40.543
I'm not supposed to be here.

41:42.682 --> 41:46.050
Frank, don't you
want someone with experience

41:46.119 --> 41:48.247
and someone that can satisfy you?

41:48.354 --> 41:51.517
I want you, only you.

41:53.059 --> 41:55.426
And we'll only go as far as you want to.

42:02.435 --> 42:03.925
What about home?

42:05.905 --> 42:08.670
You said we'll go as far as I want to go.

42:08.775 --> 42:11.574
Well, let me take you
to my world, where I'm from.

42:11.644 --> 42:12.907
I'll show it to you.

42:39.672 --> 42:42.073
<i>This is the world
of</i> One Thousand and One Nights.

42:51.651 --> 42:52.812
Let me take a selfie.

43:06.099 --> 43:07.533
Do you see your dad often?

43:07.633 --> 43:10.068
Every once in a while.
He lives in a different city, though.

43:10.169 --> 43:12.695
We should go there and visit.
I can finally meet him.

43:12.805 --> 43:14.705
Yeah, right.

43:22.315 --> 43:24.147
Here let me help you.
And this is for you.

43:24.217 --> 43:26.379
Oh, thank you.

43:26.486 --> 43:28.181
What's so funny about that?

43:28.254 --> 43:29.779
What do you mean?

43:29.856 --> 43:31.346
Us visiting your dad's city?

43:31.457 --> 43:36.122
Nothing. It's just you said you
wanted to meet my dad.

43:36.195 --> 43:39.028
Yeah, so?

43:40.133 --> 43:43.660
- What are you getting at?
- We'll talk later.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.509
I forgot the sugar.

43:53.079 --> 43:55.070
I'm just trying to understand.

43:55.181 --> 43:57.582
It's nothing.
I just can't... I don't know.

43:57.683 --> 43:59.242
You sound like you're ashamed of me.

43:59.352 --> 44:01.377
No, of course not.

44:01.454 --> 44:03.548
You know it's complicated
when it comes to my father,

44:03.623 --> 44:06.115
and it would be different
if we were just...

44:07.126 --> 44:09.185
Wow, okay.

44:09.262 --> 44:11.253
Frank, you have to understand that...

44:11.364 --> 44:13.264
Look, you need to ask
if that's what I want.

44:20.606 --> 44:24.804
Sarah told me you already know our food,
but haven't tried our tea yet.

44:24.911 --> 44:27.608
Well, I'm sure
it's as delicious as your food.

44:37.023 --> 44:41.859
Mmm. So good.
And your home is beautiful.

44:41.928 --> 44:45.057
And now that I met you,
I know where Sarah gets her beauty from.

44:45.131 --> 44:47.259
He knows how to talk to women.

44:47.366 --> 44:50.802
Yeah, he has a way with words.

45:00.947 --> 45:03.348
I'm just gonna go for a walk, okay?

45:03.449 --> 45:04.848
You're still upset about earlier?

45:04.951 --> 45:08.251
I mean, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said it.

45:08.321 --> 45:11.188
- Can you forget about this?
- I can't.

45:11.290 --> 45:14.260
- It changes everything, Frank.
- It changes everything?

45:14.327 --> 45:16.352
- We're just talking about...
- Are we?

45:16.462 --> 45:19.955
- Is that all we're doing, we're talking?
- No, that's not what I mean.

45:20.032 --> 45:22.160
But we both know
marriage is a big commitment.

45:22.268 --> 45:24.669
Then what do you want, Frank?

45:24.770 --> 45:27.102
I'm just not ready...

45:27.173 --> 45:29.267
I'll talk to you later then.

46:25.898 --> 46:27.593
Anybody help you with that?

46:27.700 --> 46:30.692
No, did it all by myself.

46:32.171 --> 46:34.663
Good job. You spelled it right, too.
What's that for?

46:36.342 --> 46:38.743
Our mailbox.

46:38.844 --> 46:40.471
Look, I want to be with you

46:40.546 --> 46:43.345
and make it work, one way or the other.

46:43.416 --> 46:46.386
I just need a little time.
Can we start with this?

46:47.687 --> 46:49.416
But you've never done this before.

46:49.522 --> 46:50.751
I know, right?

46:50.856 --> 46:53.154
And now my place is gonna
smell like incense all the time.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.150
Are you sure?

46:55.228 --> 46:57.356
As sure as I am that I love you.

47:04.570 --> 47:06.698
By the way, not incense.

47:06.772 --> 47:08.900
It's gonna smell like Arab cuisine.

47:32.265 --> 47:33.289
Wait.

47:33.399 --> 47:35.094
Okay, I'll stop.

47:40.306 --> 47:41.774
You don't have to feel guilty.

47:57.223 --> 47:58.918
You like the way I feel?

48:00.293 --> 48:02.785
You sure we're not doing anything wrong?

48:03.996 --> 48:05.930
We're not doing anything wrong.

48:12.605 --> 48:14.972
Please don't hurt me.

48:15.041 --> 48:16.167
Sarah...

49:00.453 --> 49:01.887
It's not possible.

49:01.987 --> 49:04.615
His tire burst
and he lost control of his car.

49:05.991 --> 49:07.618
I'm so sorry.

49:11.564 --> 49:14.829
I don't think that we'll be able to get
you a furlough to attend the funeral.

49:14.900 --> 49:16.561
- Usually...
- It wasn't an accident.

49:16.669 --> 49:20.264
- Pardon me?
- It wasn't an accident.

49:20.373 --> 49:22.068
Oh, God, you're gonna tell me...

49:22.174 --> 49:25.269
What is this, a joke?
He just died?

49:25.378 --> 49:27.346
Frank, I don't know what to say.

49:27.413 --> 49:30.576
Look, there's gotta be a way to get ahold
of everything he worked on, right?

49:30.683 --> 49:31.946
I mean his files, his computer...

49:32.051 --> 49:33.212
- Frank...
- His laptop.

49:33.285 --> 49:34.411
Frank, listen to me.

49:34.520 --> 49:38.514
I'm sparing you the details,
but his car was totaled.

49:38.591 --> 49:40.184
He was on his way back from work.

49:40.259 --> 49:42.057
So I don't think that was the case.

49:42.128 --> 49:44.529
Okay, Bobby told me everything.

49:44.597 --> 49:47.066
He told me this judge is corrupt,

49:47.166 --> 49:49.692
and he's involved in bribery scandals
in the Middle East.

49:49.769 --> 49:54.673
I know this is horrible news,
but there's a police investigation.

49:54.740 --> 49:58.768
So far they said they have no reason
to believe it was not an accident.

49:58.878 --> 50:01.245
They're the reason I'm in here!
Don't you get it?!

50:01.347 --> 50:04.112
Oh, my God,
this fucking judge killed Bobby!

50:04.216 --> 50:05.843
He fucking killed him!

50:06.852 --> 50:08.377
Hold on, hold on.

50:08.454 --> 50:10.889
Why would this judge
personally go after you?

50:10.956 --> 50:12.617
I don't know!

50:12.725 --> 50:15.786
But Bobby found something
about the Middle East and contracts.

50:15.895 --> 50:17.488
The judge giving out contracts
and shit like that,

50:17.596 --> 50:19.086
and you have to investigate this.

50:19.165 --> 50:22.760
Frank, you know I cannot
go after a state court judge

50:22.835 --> 50:24.599
- without strong evidence.
- Why, why?

50:24.670 --> 50:26.604
If Bobby found out, why can't you?

50:27.606 --> 50:31.167
Look, I really want to help you.

50:31.277 --> 50:32.972
But do you realize what you're asking me?

50:33.078 --> 50:34.671
This is nuts.

50:34.780 --> 50:36.111
You said you'd do anything to help me!

50:36.182 --> 50:38.344
I said I would do whatever it takes.

50:38.451 --> 50:42.445
But this? This involves
risking my job or my freedom.

50:42.521 --> 50:44.011
Oh, fuck your job! Fuck your freedom!

50:44.123 --> 50:46.615
Fuck your comfort! Is that
what fucking matters right now?

50:46.725 --> 50:49.126
Are you in league
with that son of a bitch?

50:49.228 --> 50:50.992
What are you...
What are you talking about?

50:51.096 --> 50:53.394
Yeah, you are, aren't you?
That's how he found out about Bobby.

50:53.466 --> 50:56.993
That's why I'm still fucking in here.
And to think I trusted you!

50:58.003 --> 50:59.994
- Frank...
- You're such a fucking bitch!

51:00.105 --> 51:01.231
Frank, you're losing your mind.

51:01.307 --> 51:02.570
I'm done with you! Done!

51:02.641 --> 51:04.075
- Frank... Frank!
- Done!

51:16.021 --> 51:17.182
What the hell is that?

52:26.725 --> 52:29.695
Hold on there a second, my friend.

52:29.762 --> 52:32.925
I'm sorry to interrupt,
you gray little fucking guys,

52:33.032 --> 52:37.230
but have here a letter from the warden

52:37.303 --> 52:40.933
ordering me to shut down the meditation
room until further notice.

52:41.040 --> 52:47.036
So you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,
get the fuck outta here now.

52:47.112 --> 52:48.876
- No, man.
- What's up, man?

52:48.948 --> 52:51.747
We are just trying to pray, sir.

52:51.850 --> 52:53.784
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

52:53.886 --> 52:55.217
It's not my decision.

52:55.287 --> 52:57.847
Don't make it bad on me.

52:57.923 --> 53:00.017
If you got something to say,

53:00.092 --> 53:04.928
feel free to file a complaint,
and I can wipe my ass with it.

53:05.931 --> 53:07.524
You ever see a John Wayne movie?

53:07.600 --> 53:09.898
Well, it always ends up in fisticuffs.

53:09.969 --> 53:11.698
We call it Western psychotherapy.

53:12.705 --> 53:14.901
You want a little Western psychotherapy?

53:17.876 --> 53:19.537
Back off.

53:22.514 --> 53:24.004
Did you hear what I said?

53:24.116 --> 53:27.086
I want everyone out of this room
in the next five seconds,

53:27.152 --> 53:30.144
or I'll start spraying and clubbing.

53:41.266 --> 53:42.825
Come on, faster, faster, faster.

53:42.935 --> 53:44.960
Get in a tighter circle, there you go.

53:45.037 --> 53:46.971
Tighter circle, there you go.

53:48.774 --> 53:50.173
Round 'em up.

53:50.275 --> 53:52.266
Okay, round and around
and around and around.

53:52.344 --> 53:53.812
Back from SHU?

53:53.912 --> 53:57.143
- I said three days was enough.
- Look at you.

53:57.249 --> 53:59.616
I know some brother
that have been there for weeks.

53:59.685 --> 54:01.915
I know, I heard 'em.

54:01.987 --> 54:03.352
What do you mean?

54:03.455 --> 54:05.082
They were praying all the time.

54:06.158 --> 54:07.489
Sometime we sent to the hole

54:07.593 --> 54:10.927
just because a guard
having a bad day, you know?

54:10.996 --> 54:12.964
Prayer, it's liberating for us.

54:13.032 --> 54:16.093
Maybe for you. I need more.

54:16.168 --> 54:18.694
Listen, I had a chance to think about it.

54:18.804 --> 54:21.933
I can't sit here while the son of a bitch
that sent me away is free.

54:22.007 --> 54:23.771
He made things very personal for me.

54:23.842 --> 54:26.868
So I'm gonna get out of here.

54:26.979 --> 54:28.378
I got a plan, but I need your help.

54:29.648 --> 54:30.979
Forget about this.

54:31.050 --> 54:32.381
- Listen, all I'm saying is...
- No.

54:32.484 --> 54:34.543
- Would you listen to me?
- No, you listen to me.

54:34.653 --> 54:38.146
I'm here. I serve my time,
and I get the fuck out.

54:38.223 --> 54:40.749
Frank, I told you personal things.

54:40.859 --> 54:43.385
I guess Saud was right.

54:43.495 --> 54:46.089
Betrayal never come from your enemies.

54:46.198 --> 54:49.190
So do your thing
and leave me out of this shit.

54:50.402 --> 54:51.767
Can I count on you to be quiet?

54:51.870 --> 54:54.669
I ain't no snitch.

54:56.675 --> 54:59.645
Listen, Ayman, I'm genuine, all right?

54:59.712 --> 55:01.043
I'm not trying to use you.

55:03.682 --> 55:05.081
Peace out, Frank.

55:12.224 --> 55:15.057
Sir, I have strong reasons to believe
that, through the use of that room,

55:15.160 --> 55:18.391
Muslim inmates are forming gangs
and bullying other inmates.

55:23.235 --> 55:24.396
You hear him, Ferris?

55:24.503 --> 55:26.164
I am sorry.

55:26.238 --> 55:29.936
I understand your frustration,
but will not reconsider my decision.

55:30.042 --> 55:33.410
Come on, it's not like I'm
taking away your freedom of religion.

55:33.479 --> 55:37.040
You can still pray in pairs in your cells.

55:40.319 --> 55:42.947
Is there anything else
you would like to say, Ferris?

56:15.287 --> 56:17.654
- <i>Salaam,</i> brother.
- Can I talk to you?

56:17.756 --> 56:18.780
Right now.

56:20.425 --> 56:21.756
What's up?

56:22.961 --> 56:24.622
There's a man who's gotta die.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.595
I'm in here for the exact reason
you just said...

56:31.670 --> 56:35.197
My country abandoning me, silencing me.

56:36.208 --> 56:37.937
Who is this man?

56:40.145 --> 56:45.208
A judge, a corrupt sick fuck
that wants to see me stay here.

56:45.317 --> 56:47.945
He killed my best friend.

56:48.020 --> 56:49.613
What do you want us to do about it?

56:50.622 --> 56:51.851
I don't know.

56:51.957 --> 56:53.356
I'm thinking about getting
out of here myself and doing it,

56:53.458 --> 56:56.393
but as long as he gets
what he deserves.

56:56.495 --> 56:57.826
Now, I know you got connections
in the outside,

56:57.896 --> 57:01.025
so, I'm willing to pay you.

57:04.136 --> 57:09.939
So... would you like us to send his head
in a gift wrap box

57:10.008 --> 57:12.978
or is that not necessary?

57:13.045 --> 57:16.276
Who do you think you are, Frank? Hm?

57:16.348 --> 57:18.544
Do you think we're
some kind of low cost hitmen?

57:18.650 --> 57:19.879
That's not what I mean.

57:19.985 --> 57:23.944
Now, I don't know how you even fix
your mouth to ask me something like that.

57:24.022 --> 57:26.286
And they call me the extremist.

57:26.358 --> 57:28.122
Just think for a second

57:28.193 --> 57:32.528
what you're willing to do for
the love of this one woman, huh?

57:32.598 --> 57:35.693
You think that your cause
is more noble than ours?

57:35.767 --> 57:37.428
That woman was my life!

57:38.437 --> 57:39.905
He took it from me.

57:41.273 --> 57:43.708
Your passion has got you blind.

57:45.611 --> 57:47.579
Look what you've become.

57:47.679 --> 57:49.340
Listen, you're right.

57:49.414 --> 57:52.611
America lost its way, its values.

57:52.718 --> 57:55.187
Everything it stood for.

57:55.254 --> 57:57.416
You don't know what you're talking about.

57:57.522 --> 58:00.890
You thought you could sit
in the comfort of your cell

58:00.959 --> 58:04.088
and have some of our brothers go out
and do your dirty work for you?

58:04.196 --> 58:07.860
That you're so superior to them
that they would risk their life for you?

58:07.933 --> 58:10.265
Killed for you?

58:10.369 --> 58:11.598
For you?

58:13.372 --> 58:19.277
Jihad is not just
some ruthless act of Killing.

58:19.378 --> 58:22.109
You have to be willing
to give up everything.

58:22.214 --> 58:25.240
Your family, your wealth, your dreams...

58:26.251 --> 58:28.743
and yes, even your life.

58:30.355 --> 58:31.948
You don't understand me.

58:32.057 --> 58:33.821
Let me ask you something, Frank.

58:34.960 --> 58:36.985
You even believe in God?

58:43.168 --> 58:47.935
I think it's time
you find some other protection.

01:00:12.858 --> 01:00:15.122
<i>I can't believe you're
gonna do that over there.</i>

01:00:16.528 --> 01:00:17.962
She's willing to take me
to her hometown

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:21.022
and lie to her dad about us being married
just to indulge me.

01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:23.830
<i>Ah, that tells you
how much she loves you.</i>

01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:24.960
Well, she won't need to lie.

01:00:25.037 --> 01:00:28.302
<i>I saw that coming.
I mean, how long has it been?</i>

01:00:28.373 --> 01:00:30.740
Two years since
she first brought me here.

01:00:32.711 --> 01:00:34.372
I guess I'm finally ready.

01:00:35.914 --> 01:00:37.882
It feels like the right time.

01:00:37.983 --> 01:00:39.781
<i>What can I say?
Congratulations, buddy.</i>

01:00:39.885 --> 01:00:42.047
<i>I'm really happy for you.</i>

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.054
<i>Don't forget to bring me
back a souvenir, okay?</i>

01:00:44.122 --> 01:00:46.784
<i>I gotta go. It's daytime here
and I got a deadline today,</i>

01:00:46.892 --> 01:00:49.691
<i>so I'll talk to you later, okay?
Congrats, man.</i>

01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:51.729
Thanks, Bobby, take care.

01:01:08.113 --> 01:01:09.239
Where are you going?

01:01:10.682 --> 01:01:12.446
You saw me?

01:01:12.551 --> 01:01:15.577
Yeah, you gonna leave me there
worried to death?

01:01:17.055 --> 01:01:18.716
We've been through a lot, right?

01:01:20.058 --> 01:01:22.959
My dad, he used to bring me here
when he was still with my mom

01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:25.086
and he would teach me how to walk.

01:01:25.197 --> 01:01:27.632
I don't remember, but my mom
would show me pictures.

01:01:30.302 --> 01:01:31.633
It's so quiet.

01:01:31.736 --> 01:01:33.898
- It's peaceful.
- Yeah.

01:01:33.972 --> 01:01:35.872
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:35.941 --> 01:01:38.569
Um, I'm a little bit paranoid around here.

01:01:38.643 --> 01:01:40.133
Okay.

01:01:40.245 --> 01:01:43.146
I know you're all worked up
about your father, and...

01:01:44.149 --> 01:01:45.639
I want to tell you something.

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:52.853
These last two years have just been
an adventure of pure magic, delight.

01:01:54.693 --> 01:01:56.525
And I'm constantly learning from you.

01:01:58.096 --> 01:02:01.088
Every day I get to wake up
and see you in bed...

01:02:02.634 --> 01:02:06.434
I don't want it to end... ever.

01:02:06.505 --> 01:02:09.031
- So...
- Hey!

01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:18.275
Good evening, sirs.

01:02:23.655 --> 01:02:27.990
Tell me, somebody told us.
Did he follow you?

01:02:28.093 --> 01:02:31.495
No, no, it's just a misunderstanding.
I... We're just having a night walk.

01:02:48.013 --> 01:02:49.674
This is not nightclub here.

01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:51.546
Yeah, I know that, but what's your point?

01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:12.862
I don't understand, I'm sorry.

01:03:12.938 --> 01:03:14.406
Can any one of you speak English?

01:03:16.474 --> 01:03:19.409
Okay, where are you from, sir?

01:03:19.511 --> 01:03:22.242
- From America.
- We're both from America.

01:03:22.347 --> 01:03:23.178
Mm.

01:03:29.854 --> 01:03:33.984
I want to see your passports
and yours, pretty girl.

01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:36.585
Frank, shh, okay.

01:03:36.695 --> 01:03:39.221
I'm sorry, we don't
have our passports right now.

01:03:39.331 --> 01:03:41.766
Okay, we're on our way to the hotel.
We don't live here.

01:03:44.102 --> 01:03:49.063
Okay. I need to see your ID.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.973
I'm sorry, we're not criminals.
We did nothing wrong.

01:03:52.077 --> 01:03:53.977
- My girlfriend and I, we're just...
- Girlfriend!

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.309
Girlfriend.

01:03:56.414 --> 01:03:59.645
- It's-it's actually more.
- Okay, okay.

01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:02.083
So if I check out your hotel,

01:04:02.153 --> 01:04:04.952
I will not find out that you share
the same room, right?

01:04:05.056 --> 01:04:06.490
No, no, no, listen.

01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:08.491
We don't have our papers right now, okay?

01:04:08.593 --> 01:04:11.927
But we just want to get out of your way
and-and let you have a good night, okay?

01:04:11.997 --> 01:04:13.988
So please, let us be on our way.

01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:22.301
I want to see your marriage certificate.

01:04:22.407 --> 01:04:24.205
What-what marriage certificate?

01:04:24.276 --> 01:04:27.644
Yes, your marriage certificate!

01:04:27.746 --> 01:04:29.874
It's not nightclub here!

01:04:39.557 --> 01:04:41.457
People just walk around with
their marriage certificates around here?

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:44.221
No, no one walks around
with their marriage certificate, okay?

01:04:44.296 --> 01:04:46.264
They just want money,
so let me give it to them.

01:04:46.331 --> 01:04:47.992
Fuck that! We didn't do anything wrong.

01:04:48.099 --> 01:04:49.965
Frank, you're not understanding, okay?

01:04:50.035 --> 01:04:53.266
We're not supposed to be in public
by ourselves. We're breaking the law.

01:04:53.338 --> 01:04:56.501
Just give me a second, okay?

01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:45.122
I don't want anything from you.

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:48.820
Just show me your certificate.

01:05:48.893 --> 01:05:50.657
I'm sorry,
I don't have my certificate,

01:05:50.729 --> 01:05:53.596
but we can make an arrangement.

01:05:54.899 --> 01:05:58.028
Okay, if you have a date, okay.

01:06:01.072 --> 01:06:02.164
- Please, please!
- Hey, come on.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.401
What the fuck is going on?

01:06:03.508 --> 01:06:05.272
Hey, go back there.

01:06:05.377 --> 01:06:07.106
We talking to your girlfriend.

01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:11.281
Take this, okay?

01:06:14.552 --> 01:06:15.678
You fucking whore!

01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:17.882
What the fuck
is wrong with you, huh?

01:06:17.956 --> 01:06:19.890
Let's go, let's go!

01:06:22.894 --> 01:06:25.090
Stop! I said stop!

01:06:57.796 --> 01:06:59.491
Please, don't tell anyone.

01:07:30.995 --> 01:07:32.895
It was my son.

01:07:32.964 --> 01:07:37.629
The year I converted,
somebody very dear to me died.

01:07:39.404 --> 01:07:40.803
Hit-and-run.

01:07:42.106 --> 01:07:44.598
He was 19.

01:07:44.676 --> 01:07:46.303
Just started college.

01:07:49.981 --> 01:07:54.077
We came together from France
to get him set up.

01:07:55.053 --> 01:07:56.452
I'm sorry.

01:07:58.389 --> 01:07:59.788
Did they catch the guy?

01:08:01.526 --> 01:08:02.823
I did.

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:06.661
A witness called me.

01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:10.668
She thought it was a good idea
to tell me instead of the police.

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:13.997
Now I'm here.

01:08:15.006 --> 01:08:16.303
What'd you do to him?

01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:21.536
Let's just say he's still alive.

01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:25.611
He never did time?

01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:27.517
Whatever.

01:08:27.618 --> 01:08:30.212
They didn't catch me back then.

01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:34.189
I hit the roads, moved abroad.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.392
And my wife left me.

01:08:41.366 --> 01:08:44.131
I lost everything.

01:08:44.202 --> 01:08:46.533
I had no more reason to live...

01:08:49.474 --> 01:08:51.670
but God show me His mercy.

01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:54.645
He didn't want me dead.

01:08:56.413 --> 01:08:57.779
He wanted me reborn.

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:03.350
So I turned myself in.

01:09:15.533 --> 01:09:17.228
I got a deal for you.

01:09:20.071 --> 01:09:22.563
Do you think justice exists, Frank?

01:09:23.575 --> 01:09:26.374
Maybe... sometimes.

01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:28.912
Sometimes.

01:09:30.014 --> 01:09:32.073
Only in the hereafter, Frank.

01:09:32.183 --> 01:09:35.050
You can be as honest or upright
as you want in this world,

01:09:35.118 --> 01:09:38.714
and some crook will always come along
and crush you and get away with it.

01:09:39.724 --> 01:09:41.055
You know why, Frank?

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.861
Because transgression is always easier.

01:09:44.929 --> 01:09:46.124
What do you want from me, Saud?

01:09:50.702 --> 01:09:53.103
I want to offer you paradise, brother.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.599
And together we can
send a message to the world.

01:10:01.613 --> 01:10:03.138
Why'd I do that?

01:10:04.749 --> 01:10:07.480
You said you wanted
that judge down, right?

01:10:07.585 --> 01:10:09.019
I can make it happen.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.952
I can let <i>you</i> do it,

01:10:11.022 --> 01:10:13.423
so you can look in his eyes beforehand.

01:10:14.459 --> 01:10:17.326
He Killed your best friend,
he Killed your girlfriend

01:10:17.428 --> 01:10:19.829
and now they got you in here rottin'.

01:10:19.931 --> 01:10:23.196
You might die in here.
If you gonna die, die as a martyr.

01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:28.637
Do it for us and God will grant you
the highest level of paradise.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.856
I know what happened in your cell.
That's why I think you're ready.

01:10:48.626 --> 01:10:52.187
Do you really want to end up in hellfire?

01:10:52.296 --> 01:10:55.095
Let's go see a man about a dog, Frenchie.

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:56.292
Come on.

01:10:57.301 --> 01:10:58.462
Think about it.

01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:02.030
It's a damn good deal.

01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:06.640
What do you mean,
they're gonna reopen it?

01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:13.413
The US district judge ruled that closing
that room violated a 1993 law

01:11:13.518 --> 01:11:16.385
that banned the government
from curtailing religious speech

01:11:16.487 --> 01:11:19.422
without showing compelling interest.

01:11:19.524 --> 01:11:21.549
They don't have a clue
what they're talking about.

01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:23.889
We're the ones risking our ass
for them in here.

01:11:23.995 --> 01:11:28.728
I know, Louis. I'm with you on this,
but we tried and they won.

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:30.858
Fuck this shit, sir.

01:11:30.935 --> 01:11:33.165
Giving us orders from their warm seats.

01:11:33.237 --> 01:11:35.831
Do you know how many inmates
gather in there all the time?

01:11:35.907 --> 01:11:38.035
I can't do nothing if they rebel.

01:11:38.142 --> 01:11:40.509
They'll kill us before we get any backup.

01:11:40.578 --> 01:11:42.808
How did they find out anyway?

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:49.547
Some civil liberties group filed a motion
on behalf of one of the inmates.

01:11:49.654 --> 01:11:51.053
Who?

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:55.382
Okay, I'm gonna tell you, Louis,
but you have to promise me to remain calm.

01:11:55.493 --> 01:11:57.825
- No retaliation.
- It's Ferris, right?

01:11:57.895 --> 01:12:00.592
Did you hear what I just said?

01:12:00.698 --> 01:12:02.860
He's got connections on the outside.

01:12:02.934 --> 01:12:04.629
Just tell me, goddammit.

01:12:04.736 --> 01:12:06.704
Is it Ferris, yes or no?

01:12:11.275 --> 01:12:13.573
- Hey, Gary.
- What up, Louis?

01:12:13.644 --> 01:12:17.046
I'm sorry about those towelheads.
They're always rocking the boat.

01:12:17.115 --> 01:12:18.776
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:18.883 --> 01:12:22.319
Well, those niggers could chill
or heads are gonna roll.

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.149
I don't give a fuck either way.

01:12:24.255 --> 01:12:26.121
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:12:26.224 --> 01:12:28.921
I'll take care of it.
Don't you worry, I swear to God.

01:12:28.993 --> 01:12:31.223
Do me a favor.

01:12:31.295 --> 01:12:34.595
You tell the rest of your boys,
all the guards...

01:12:35.867 --> 01:12:39.360
I'm not here just doing time
like all these other motherfuckers.

01:12:39.437 --> 01:12:41.030
You feel me?

01:12:41.105 --> 01:12:44.131
I'm making money, all right?

01:12:44.242 --> 01:12:46.540
Now if I gotta go through
this bullshit again,

01:12:46.611 --> 01:12:48.579
your pregnant wife...

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.605
she ain't gonna be so pregnant, okay?

01:12:52.784 --> 01:12:54.616
And that little girl,

01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:58.986
your little daughter Emily in the third
grade, John Hopkins Elementary?

01:12:59.991 --> 01:13:03.894
She's gonna look awful funny
walking around with no goddamn ears.

01:13:05.963 --> 01:13:08.364
I swear to God, Gary,
I'll take care of it.

01:13:11.335 --> 01:13:13.804
Have a nice evening.

01:13:13.871 --> 01:13:15.635
Thanks, Gary.

01:13:15.706 --> 01:13:18.368
I'll have someone
cut the phone lines.

01:13:18.476 --> 01:13:20.342
So no wires connect,

01:13:20.444 --> 01:13:23.209
no panic button for at least 90 seconds.

01:13:24.816 --> 01:13:28.184
- What about the merchandise?
- Smuggled in already.

01:13:28.286 --> 01:13:33.224
Shoulda seen their face when I asked
for two bottles of Bacardi 151.

01:13:34.225 --> 01:13:35.659
Okay, so that's...

01:13:44.702 --> 01:13:46.830
<i>Hi, I'm Malik, the volunteer.</i>

01:13:46.938 --> 01:13:49.498
<i>Can you teach me Arabic?
I want to read ft.</i>

01:13:51.108 --> 01:13:54.874
<i>Even native Arabic speakers
find it difficult to understand.</i>

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.371
<i>I want to introduce you
to somebody.</i>

01:14:07.625 --> 01:14:09.719
<i>Sarah, my wife.</i>

01:14:09.827 --> 01:14:12.262
She was always
showing me things, teaching me.

01:14:12.363 --> 01:14:15.993
The first time I met her
she gave me this.

01:14:16.067 --> 01:14:20.061
I understand now I need to do it for her.

01:14:27.745 --> 01:14:30.942
So what made you want my services again?

01:14:31.048 --> 01:14:33.107
Let's just say I'm coming to terms
with my demons.

01:14:38.089 --> 01:14:40.922
I'm sorry for what I said to you,
but I have an idea.

01:15:10.121 --> 01:15:12.590
Hey, Ferris. Come here.

01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:31.402
That was a smooth move you pulled
with your union outside.

01:15:31.475 --> 01:15:33.000
You know, about the room.

01:15:34.178 --> 01:15:36.112
You didn't like my decision, huh?

01:15:37.415 --> 01:15:39.110
I thought it was the warden's.

01:15:40.251 --> 01:15:44.882
You know, I understand why they wanted
to get you back here so badly, Ferris.

01:15:44.956 --> 01:15:48.256
I always thought you'd do better
with a shithole in the Middle East

01:15:48.326 --> 01:15:50.954
with the rest of your tribe.

01:15:52.663 --> 01:15:55.826
There's one thing you seem to forget.

01:15:55.933 --> 01:16:00.495
I rule here,
and I won't let you get away with it.

01:16:01.505 --> 01:16:04.964
I swear on the graves
of my fallen comrades.

01:17:03.501 --> 01:17:04.491
<i>Yo.</i>

01:17:05.503 --> 01:17:06.993
I'm so happy.

01:17:07.071 --> 01:17:08.427
I can finally call you

01:17:13.177 --> 01:17:14.406
What's going on?

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.111
Check it out.
I am not safe here anymore,

01:17:19.216 --> 01:17:21.344
and I don't want
to compromise the mission.

01:17:21.419 --> 01:17:24.445
Now there's a van
waiting one mile south of here.

01:17:24.555 --> 01:17:28.355
Inside of it, you'll find everything
you need to do tonight.

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:30.190
There's one thing though.

01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:33.424
The guards,
they're scrutinizing my cell,

01:17:33.531 --> 01:17:35.932
so we need to do it from yours.

01:17:36.033 --> 01:17:39.230
There's a detail
we gotta take care of.

01:17:39.303 --> 01:17:41.431
- Ayman.
- What about him?

01:17:41.539 --> 01:17:44.099
You gotta get him out your cell.

01:17:44.208 --> 01:17:45.539
I'll talk to him.

01:17:45.609 --> 01:17:47.236
No, man, it's too risky.

01:17:47.311 --> 01:17:49.040
He can't know nothing about this.

01:17:49.113 --> 01:17:50.808
What are you proposing?

01:17:50.915 --> 01:17:54.317
Unfortunately, there's only one solution.

01:17:54.418 --> 01:17:58.252
Now, I need you to slide this
under his mattress

01:17:58.322 --> 01:18:00.791
- and then tell the guard.
- Did you lose your fucking mind?

01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:03.417
- They'll throw him in the SHU.
- And that's what we want.

01:18:03.494 --> 01:18:06.486
It'll be a sacrifice
and he'll be compensated.

01:18:06.597 --> 01:18:09.225
This is your grand plan?
To betray one of our own?

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.997
No, not me. You.

01:18:13.838 --> 01:18:15.465
You gonna do it.

01:18:42.766 --> 01:18:46.100
You know, normally cell searches

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:49.435
are the bane of my existence, Frenchie,

01:18:49.507 --> 01:18:53.102
but in your case, it's so clean,

01:18:53.177 --> 01:18:57.171
SO organized, so civilized.

01:19:01.118 --> 01:19:03.314
I never can understand
about this lovely stuff.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:08.119
Is it, uh, upside down?
Right to left? Left to right?

01:19:12.363 --> 01:19:14.798
Everything in its proper place.

01:19:25.309 --> 01:19:26.834
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:19:26.911 --> 01:19:28.640
Wait just a second.

01:19:30.314 --> 01:19:31.645
Well, what do we have here?

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:35.045
Well, well, well.

01:19:35.152 --> 01:19:38.884
This is a violation
of two sacred texts, Frenchie.

01:19:39.924 --> 01:19:43.485
The Qur'an and Louis' no-no's

01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:46.428
for freaky fucking Franco-foreigners.

01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:47.895
I don't know what it is.

01:19:48.899 --> 01:19:50.731
It's not mine.

01:19:50.834 --> 01:19:53.064
You shouldn't have tried
that with me, Frenchie.

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:54.365
You're dead grilled meat.

01:19:54.438 --> 01:19:57.203
I got nothing to do with this shit.

01:19:57.274 --> 01:19:59.208
Take him away.

01:19:59.276 --> 01:20:01.711
Frank! Frank, tell him!

01:20:01.779 --> 01:20:03.076
Frank, tell him it wasn't me!

01:20:04.081 --> 01:20:05.071
Frank!

01:20:09.086 --> 01:20:12.522
Why don't you
take the rest of the day off?

01:20:15.326 --> 01:20:18.352
Serious? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

01:20:18.429 --> 01:20:19.919
- What you gonna do?
- Sit down.

01:20:20.931 --> 01:20:22.695
And shut the fuck up.

01:20:27.838 --> 01:20:29.431
You know, I don't like you, Frenchie.

01:20:30.441 --> 01:20:31.602
No kidding.

01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:33.837
Mm-hmm. You know...

01:20:36.547 --> 01:20:39.278
I don't find this arousing anymore.

01:20:39.383 --> 01:20:43.251
It's not that it's not fun
in a small pond scum kind of way.

01:20:43.354 --> 01:20:46.085
But tonight we're gonna widen the circle.

01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:49.182
You're going down for a long time.

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:53.595
But I'm gonna take every one
of those cult brethren of yours with you.

01:21:03.907 --> 01:21:07.434
Now, that thing you hid
came from the outside.

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.577
And all along I thought
you fuckers didn't use that.

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:16.314
And it turns out, you're just as decadent
as the rest of us.

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.286
Listen to me clear.

01:21:18.389 --> 01:21:21.552
I want every one of those Muslim filth.

01:21:22.559 --> 01:21:23.788
Just tell me!

01:21:24.995 --> 01:21:26.292
What do you want to know?

01:21:26.363 --> 01:21:28.991
Oh, it's that easy, huh?

01:21:29.099 --> 01:21:30.794
I've been set up.

01:21:30.868 --> 01:21:32.859
That thing you got, it ain't mine.

01:21:34.171 --> 01:21:36.970
And I don't want to go down for them.

01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:39.203
But I know who's preparing something.

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:40.709
Who?

01:21:41.712 --> 01:21:43.703
I think this whole mess with me,

01:21:43.814 --> 01:21:47.341
it's just a diversion
while they're escaping.

01:21:48.352 --> 01:21:50.286
Maybe even now.

01:21:51.889 --> 01:21:55.189
Who the fuck is it?!
Give me a goddamn name!

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:56.851
Oh, my Lord,

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.657
do not blame us
if we have forgotten or erred.

01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:03.894
If I'm gonna snitch, I want to be sure
that I will be safe.

01:22:04.001 --> 01:22:05.662
Oh, fuck you!

01:22:05.736 --> 01:22:08.398
Get up, you motherfucker,
or I'll beat you to death myself.

01:22:09.406 --> 01:22:10.567
Get up!

01:22:11.809 --> 01:22:13.641
Oh, my Lord,

01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:15.372
do not lay upon us burdens

01:22:15.479 --> 01:22:19.347
like those You laid upon those before us.

01:22:19.416 --> 01:22:22.647
I am gonna take you to SHU myself.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.588
And you're not gonna see sunrise
and sunset for years to come.

01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:31.992
And when you get out, I'm going to turn
you into a glam bitch on the runway.

01:22:32.062 --> 01:22:34.690
Give me a fucking name!

01:22:34.798 --> 01:22:37.790
Ferris. Ferris is the brain.

01:22:37.868 --> 01:22:39.666
- Check his cell, quick.
- Okay!

01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:41.398
Oh, my Lord,

01:22:41.505 --> 01:22:44.839
do not impose burdens upon us
beyond what we can bear.

01:22:44.908 --> 01:22:47.809
<i>The cell is empty!
The cell is empty!</i>

01:22:47.878 --> 01:22:49.004
Roger that.

01:22:49.079 --> 01:22:50.740
There's been...

01:22:52.683 --> 01:22:55.050
I am gonna wrap your head in bacon

01:22:55.152 --> 01:22:58.349
and separate it from your body
for all eternity!

01:22:58.422 --> 01:23:00.254
Pardon us.

01:23:00.357 --> 01:23:04.351
Check out our cell.
Frank is probably gone, too.

01:23:04.428 --> 01:23:06.487
- You're coming!
- Forgive us.

01:23:09.266 --> 01:23:10.927
Have mercy upon us.

01:23:12.035 --> 01:23:13.935
Hold onto this pillow of puss.

01:23:14.037 --> 01:23:16.199
- If he moves...
- You are our Protector...

01:23:18.442 --> 01:23:20.376
What the fuck are you doing?

01:23:20.444 --> 01:23:21.605
...give us victory...

01:23:21.712 --> 01:23:24.545
You wanna join
these goddamn fucking rats?

01:23:24.615 --> 01:23:26.049
...over those who don't believe.

01:23:28.218 --> 01:23:30.243
You and I are gonna get into it.

01:23:47.738 --> 01:23:49.001
God!

01:23:53.143 --> 01:23:55.271
Ayman, get in.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.338
You ain't coming.

01:23:58.682 --> 01:24:00.776
Come on, man.
We ain't got all day, get in!

01:24:07.524 --> 01:24:10.425
There's street clothes in the...
in the guard's room.

01:24:10.494 --> 01:24:11.757
Brother...

01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:15.929
We couldn't tell you
about the plans with your ideals.

01:24:15.999 --> 01:24:17.592
I'm sorry, man.

01:24:17.668 --> 01:24:19.136
I hope you understand.

01:24:21.004 --> 01:24:22.938
And what happened with the bottles?

01:24:23.006 --> 01:24:25.475
I gave you enough
to burn that infidel like hellfire.

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:27.510
You told me to rat on Ayman.
You didn't say with what.

01:24:31.982 --> 01:24:34.246
Something wrong with the plan, Saud?

01:24:35.252 --> 01:24:36.310
Give me the keys, man.

01:24:37.754 --> 01:24:38.846
Frank, give me the keys, man.

01:24:38.956 --> 01:24:40.424
At least give me the shank.

01:24:40.491 --> 01:24:43.256
I had to give it to him
so he could uncuff himself.

01:24:45.796 --> 01:24:49.790
God will punish you for this,
and I hope he uses my hands.

01:24:51.535 --> 01:24:52.832
Thank you, by the way.

01:24:52.936 --> 01:24:55.428
It wouldn't have been possible
without you.

01:25:04.448 --> 01:25:05.506
Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:25:06.817 --> 01:25:08.012
I'm not coming, Frank.

01:25:08.118 --> 01:25:10.018
What do you mean? We're leaving!

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:14.887
Frank, whatever you do tonight,
I hope you will find peace.

01:25:14.992 --> 01:25:18.895
But for me, this is where
I should pay for my sins.

01:25:18.996 --> 01:25:20.054
What's gonna happen to you?

01:25:20.163 --> 01:25:23.030
I don't know,
but I need to take care of them.

01:25:23.133 --> 01:25:24.498
These are the men that beat you.

01:25:24.568 --> 01:25:26.798
If I'm not merciful with other men,

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:28.964
how can I ask God to be merciful with me?

01:25:29.039 --> 01:25:31.133
- Ayman...
- You need to go now.

01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:34.768
Good luck, brother.

01:26:24.161 --> 01:26:25.629
Goodnight, Louis.

01:27:01.665 --> 01:27:03.133
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I'm out.

01:27:03.233 --> 01:27:06.464
Frank, what are you talking about?
How are you calling me right now?

01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:08.732
Listen, they're gonna come after me,

01:27:08.805 --> 01:27:10.967
so you can either help me
or you can turn me in.

01:27:11.074 --> 01:27:13.133
- You know where I'm going.
- But, Frank, this is crazy.

01:27:13.243 --> 01:27:14.472
I gotta go.

01:27:22.986 --> 01:27:24.454
Damn.

01:27:38.468 --> 01:27:39.867
What?

01:27:47.878 --> 01:27:49.368
Huh-uh.

01:27:55.819 --> 01:27:56.911
May I help you?

01:27:58.021 --> 01:27:59.147
Can you give me my life back?

01:27:59.222 --> 01:28:01.190
Hey, if you're here for money,
you come to the wrong place.

01:28:01.258 --> 01:28:03.192
- Maybe you should go to the bank.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.728
I'm not a greedy pig like you.

01:28:04.828 --> 01:28:06.091
Okay, what do you want?
Maybe I can help you.

01:28:06.196 --> 01:28:08.824
Help me? Look at me.
Do you recognize me?

01:28:08.899 --> 01:28:10.867
Did you even look at my face
before you sent me away?

01:28:10.934 --> 01:28:12.163
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:28:12.235 --> 01:28:14.101
Does he?

01:28:14.204 --> 01:28:16.195
The people that walk
through these halls every day?

01:28:16.273 --> 01:28:18.503
I believed in the rule of law
in my country

01:28:18.575 --> 01:28:22.205
and then judges like you railroad us,
deny us our rights, our freedom.

01:28:22.279 --> 01:28:23.678
Our families are destroyed.

01:28:23.747 --> 01:28:26.580
Our lives are ruined by your bullshit
court.

01:28:26.683 --> 01:28:27.707
That's the rule of law.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.891
I never did anything wrong.

01:28:37.961 --> 01:28:40.555
Don't you open your fucking mouth
with another lie.

01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:42.394
What the fuck is going on?

01:28:42.499 --> 01:28:44.194
Huh?

01:28:44.267 --> 01:28:45.894
I know exactly who you are.

01:28:46.002 --> 01:28:47.834
Your attorney just called me.

01:28:47.904 --> 01:28:50.601
She told me she wanted to show me
some new elements about your case.

01:28:50.707 --> 01:28:52.698
I suspected something when she kept
telling me who she was,

01:28:52.776 --> 01:28:54.005
but didn't show up.

01:28:54.077 --> 01:28:56.068
Then again, the word gets out
pretty quickly

01:28:56.179 --> 01:28:57.840
when you escape from jail.

01:28:57.914 --> 01:29:01.373
I'm just glad to see you here
to see them shoot you in the face.

01:29:01.451 --> 01:29:03.681
I'd drop that gun if I were you.

01:29:03.754 --> 01:29:06.917
Oh, by the way, I guess you were right.

01:29:07.023 --> 01:29:11.961
The rule of law, it's just propaganda
phrase that comes from the lawmakers.

01:29:12.062 --> 01:29:14.394
I'm not running for sainthood.

01:29:14.464 --> 01:29:16.057
I'm just an ordinary guy, pal.

01:29:16.133 --> 01:29:18.761
A hostage situation. Second floor.

01:29:18.869 --> 01:29:21.201
Launch the assault. Go, go, go!

01:29:27.244 --> 01:29:28.575
What are you doing?

01:29:28.645 --> 01:29:29.737
Why me?

01:29:29.813 --> 01:29:31.144
What are you talking about, Frank?

01:29:31.248 --> 01:29:32.909
This is not a conspiracy.

01:29:32.983 --> 01:29:34.974
- Breach is clear!
- Go, go!

01:29:35.085 --> 01:29:36.450
You know how much
your buddies in the Middle East

01:29:36.553 --> 01:29:38.817
- graft, bribery, corruption?
- So what?

01:29:38.922 --> 01:29:40.981
They're allies in our region. We need 'em.

01:29:41.091 --> 01:29:43.219
- Bravo, move to the back!
- All clear!

01:29:43.293 --> 01:29:45.091
Like Sarah needed to die for politics?

01:29:45.162 --> 01:29:46.789
I remember your case.

01:29:46.863 --> 01:29:48.957
Yeah, the police screwed up
with your little friend.

01:29:51.835 --> 01:29:53.929
Yeah, they want to keep things quiet

01:29:54.004 --> 01:29:55.870
on American citizens
shot by foreign police.

01:29:55.972 --> 01:29:59.101
No one wants an international fuss,
not over one dead body.

01:29:59.176 --> 01:30:01.144
Two dead people.
You killed my best friend!

01:30:01.211 --> 01:30:02.303
Ahh!

01:30:02.379 --> 01:30:04.780
- Clear!
- All clear!

01:30:04.848 --> 01:30:08.216
That guy stuck his nose
into my personal business!

01:30:08.318 --> 01:30:09.786
That's the difference.

01:30:09.853 --> 01:30:11.685
- I couldn't let it go.
- Neither can I.

01:30:11.788 --> 01:30:13.313
- Drop your weapon!
- Look, pal.

01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:15.358
- Two o'clock, fire at will.
- Here you go.

01:30:15.458 --> 01:30:16.948
They're not just here for me.

01:30:17.027 --> 01:30:17.960
Don't do it!

01:30:18.028 --> 01:30:21.020
Yeah, the word of a state judge
versus an escaped con's.

01:30:21.131 --> 01:30:22.690
Who do you think
they're gonna believe, pal?

01:30:25.535 --> 01:30:27.003
They're gonna believe this.

01:30:32.976 --> 01:30:34.876
Son of a bitch.

01:30:39.349 --> 01:30:43.081
Okay, so what?
You think they're gonna shoot me?

01:30:43.186 --> 01:30:44.210
This is not Iraq.

01:30:45.655 --> 01:30:49.489
I might have to pay a fine or serve
a little time, but what about you?

01:30:49.559 --> 01:30:50.788
What about Sarah?

01:30:50.861 --> 01:30:53.489
- Don't you...
- What, talk about her?

01:30:53.563 --> 01:30:54.792
Don't do anything stupid!

01:30:54.865 --> 01:30:57.300
Talk about your little romance
that sent you to jail?

01:30:57.367 --> 01:31:00.029
Well, me going to prison
ain't gonna bring her back. She's dead.

01:31:00.136 --> 01:31:01.160
Shut the fuck up!

01:31:03.907 --> 01:31:05.739
Why don't you kill me then
while you're at it, huh?

01:31:05.842 --> 01:31:08.402
An eye for an eye.
That's your religion, right?

01:31:08.511 --> 01:31:09.842
You don't know what you're saying.

01:31:09.913 --> 01:31:12.678
They told me you were among
the Muslims in that prison.

01:31:12.749 --> 01:31:14.683
That's our religion now.

01:31:14.751 --> 01:31:15.582
What?

01:31:16.586 --> 01:31:18.486
Is it surprising?

01:31:18.555 --> 01:31:20.819
I converted a long time ago.

01:31:20.891 --> 01:31:23.690
I went to their mosque,
and repeated what they said.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:27.094
Those fuckers were all happy,
but I don't care.

01:31:27.197 --> 01:31:28.426
It helps business.

01:31:28.531 --> 01:31:31.398
So go ahead, shoot me!

01:31:31.501 --> 01:31:34.402
Go ahead. Kill your brother.

01:31:36.773 --> 01:31:38.070
Frank!

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.546
No, you're not Muslim.

01:31:45.615 --> 01:31:48.243
You don't belong with your words.
You belong with your heart.

01:31:48.318 --> 01:31:52.050
You're gonna pay for your sins,
and I will pay for mine.

01:31:52.122 --> 01:31:53.988
That's why killing you
was never part of the plan.

01:31:57.494 --> 01:31:58.723
Son of a bitch.

01:31:58.795 --> 01:32:02.732
You'll answer to man
before you'll answer to God.

01:32:05.068 --> 01:32:06.229
Don't do it!

01:32:08.004 --> 01:32:08.994
Oh!

01:32:10.607 --> 01:32:11.802
Frank!

01:32:12.842 --> 01:32:14.241
Oh, my God! Call an ambulance!

01:32:16.012 --> 01:32:18.606
Man down! I repeat, man down!

01:32:18.682 --> 01:32:20.275
Require immediate assistance!

01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:21.909
Send an ambulance!

01:32:21.985 --> 01:32:25.182
Frank, stay with me.
They're calling for help.

01:32:25.288 --> 01:32:27.256
You'll be out of here soon.

01:32:27.324 --> 01:32:30.089
Laurence, I feel good.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.652
Frank, no, it's-it's over.

01:32:32.762 --> 01:32:35.322
You've done it. You were right.

01:32:35.432 --> 01:32:37.423
That's all I wanted.

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.491
That's what He wanted.

01:32:39.602 --> 01:32:41.696
That was His plan for me.

01:32:42.706 --> 01:32:44.470
And Sarah.

01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:47.941
Frank, you're not going anywhere.

01:32:50.313 --> 01:32:52.441
I'm gonna be with her soon.

01:32:52.515 --> 01:32:53.778
Frank!

01:32:54.918 --> 01:32:58.354
I can see. It's all true.

01:33:02.525 --> 01:33:05.358
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:33:05.462 --> 01:33:08.261
I gotta get you to the hospital, hold on.

01:33:15.505 --> 01:33:18.031
Don't... Don't go.

01:33:18.141 --> 01:33:19.631
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:33:29.552 --> 01:33:31.384
I'm here.

01:33:31.488 --> 01:33:33.718
I won't go, I won't leave you.

01:33:33.823 --> 01:33:36.690
Frank, you gotta tell me something.

01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:40.222
What?

01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:43.698
You said you had a question for me.

01:33:51.474 --> 01:33:52.669
Sarah...

01:33:57.047 --> 01:33:58.344
Yes.

01:34:00.116 --> 01:34:03.211
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:34:26.676 --> 01:34:28.701
<i>Given the remarkable
behavior of the inmate</i>

01:34:28.778 --> 01:34:31.110
and upon the recommendation
of prison guard, Louis Thomas...

01:34:31.214 --> 01:34:32.978
- <i>Hey.</i>
- <i>Malik, right?</i>

01:34:33.083 --> 01:34:35.950
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>You remind me of my son.</i>

01:34:36.052 --> 01:34:38.783
<i>If you want, I have an idea
of where we can go.</i>

01:34:41.391 --> 01:34:43.325
Another life that could still be here.

01:34:43.426 --> 01:34:45.588
Do you think he gazed
too long into the abyss?

01:34:46.596 --> 01:34:48.257
I don't think he did.

01:34:49.265 --> 01:34:51.131
But God knows best.

01:34:52.602 --> 01:34:54.934
Hey, uh, do you want to read
<i>Surah Ya-sin?</i>

01:34:55.004 --> 01:34:57.530
They say it's a good thing to do
when visiting a cemetery.

01:34:59.742 --> 01:35:01.710
Can you recite it for us?

01:35:40.418 --> 01:35:45.418
