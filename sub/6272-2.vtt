00:13.608 --> 00:15.708
Previously in Masters of Sex...

00:15.968 --> 00:17.348
Oh, my God!

00:17.568 --> 00:19.598
If you really want to learn about sex,

00:19.608 --> 00:21.818
then you're gonna have to get
yourself a female partner.

00:21.988 --> 00:24.668
Dr. Masters. We haven't yet met.
Are you here to interview.

00:24.728 --> 00:25.948
Can you squeeze me in now?

00:25.998 --> 00:28.068
All I could think about
the entire drive home

00:29.118 --> 00:30.218
was kissing you.

00:30.368 --> 00:31.998
Well, friends can kiss.

00:32.818 --> 00:35.358
All I do know for sure is I
am going to marry that woman.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.758
My wife is coming in next week.

00:37.828 --> 00:39.788
There is no way the great Bill Masters

00:39.828 --> 00:41.638
is going to admit he's shooting blanks.

00:41.698 --> 00:43.418
Why can't I give my husband a child?

00:43.488 --> 00:45.618
Yet we sit huddled in the dark

00:45.858 --> 00:47.538
like prudish cavemen,

00:47.598 --> 00:48.788
filled with shame

00:48.838 --> 00:51.168
when the truth is, nobody understands sex.

00:51.488 --> 00:53.677
And science holds the key.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.788
The provost of the entire
university will be watching me.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.438
He's not watching you.
He's watching science.

00:59.498 --> 01:01.118
Well, it's a remarkable feat.

01:01.178 --> 01:04.458
The phase we're considering
you for is couples.

01:04.518 --> 01:05.878
Coup... couples?

01:05.938 --> 01:07.087
Nice to meet you.

01:07.088 --> 01:08.628
I'm, uh... anonymous.

01:08.688 --> 01:10.458
I'm anonymous, too.

01:11.048 --> 01:11.858
You are my friend.

01:11.918 --> 01:14.027
Oh, Jesus Christ. Do not say "Friend."

01:14.028 --> 01:15.878
You are! You are my friend!

01:15.888 --> 01:16.908
Friends don't fuck.

01:16.978 --> 01:20.848
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
That was never my intention.

01:23.678 --> 01:26.268
We're going to be watching
couples have sex.

01:26.328 --> 01:29.148
The likelihood of us transferring

01:29.218 --> 01:32.158
all this libidinous energy
onto our patients is high.

01:32.228 --> 01:33.357
Why don't you just come out and say

01:33.358 --> 01:34.798
whatever it is you're trying to say?

01:34.818 --> 01:36.838
We should undertake the
research with each other.

01:38.168 --> 01:39.917
Can I take the weekend
to think about this?

01:39.918 --> 01:40.738
Of course.

01:42.158 --> 01:50.158
YYeTs.com

02:30.976 --> 02:33.556
Cereal and orange juice.

02:33.866 --> 02:34.786
Or toast!

02:34.846 --> 02:37.106
- OK.
- Tessa, get out of the way!

02:37.726 --> 02:39.226
Stop pushing me, Henry.

02:40.356 --> 02:41.286
I thought that...

02:41.666 --> 02:44.156
we could discuss your proposition.

02:44.866 --> 02:46.326
If that's what we're calling it.

02:50.176 --> 02:51.706
I would like to clear this up.

02:51.966 --> 02:55.086
I did take the weekend as I said I
would to consider your proposal.

02:55.136 --> 02:57.036
And I've come to the conclusion

02:57.046 --> 02:59.296
that it was an unreasonable request...

02:59.676 --> 03:00.586
on your part.

03:03.556 --> 03:04.936
And so my answer is no.

03:14.766 --> 03:17.416
You're old enough to pour
your own cereals, Henry.

03:17.756 --> 03:20.646
Captain Kai is moving No.
1 prisoner Topknot

03:20.706 --> 03:21.506
to the space pat.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.736
It's good news. You both need
to finish your juice. Tess...

03:23.856 --> 03:25.066
You too, please.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.846
I just want... I wanted to say thank you.

03:31.426 --> 03:32.386
For your offer.

03:32.456 --> 03:35.096
Your proposal is an interesting one. Us...

03:35.146 --> 03:36.576
in the study together.

03:37.006 --> 03:41.176
Although, it does put me
in a curious predicament.

03:41.226 --> 03:42.906
I'm intrigued and this...

03:42.956 --> 03:44.606
the work is compelling and...

03:44.806 --> 03:47.476
relevant. And I do feel that I
can make a real contribution...

03:47.526 --> 03:49.976
Yes or no, Virginia. I'm busy.

03:53.286 --> 03:56.395
Mom! Sergent Baldwin Black has
been bringing prisoner Topknot

03:56.396 --> 03:57.636
to the end of the iron chamber.

03:58.146 --> 03:59.996
- Mom.
- Sweetheart, we're going to miss the bus.

04:00.056 --> 04:01.606
It's why they go to the space rail.

04:01.666 --> 04:03.906
To cool down. Then they
find the boy Joey...

04:03.976 --> 04:04.966
A stowaway.

04:05.846 --> 04:06.696
Mom?

04:07.306 --> 04:08.716
Hurry up, let's go.

04:14.206 --> 04:15.866
Thank you. Come on, Tess.

04:15.926 --> 04:16.536
Hey, Mom.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.696
The best part is captain Kai gives
the boy Joey a real stun gun.

04:20.685 --> 04:22.426
I was trying to tell you...

04:23.226 --> 04:25.016
Now I'm going to miss my bus, Henry.

04:25.496 --> 04:26.266
I hear you.

04:27.556 --> 04:28.636
I'll take these.

04:28.716 --> 04:30.276
Okay, have a good day. Take this.

04:31.176 --> 04:32.096
You too.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.876
I've thought about your proposal.

04:47.976 --> 04:50.906
And if saying no means losing
my job, then I'll do it.

04:52.606 --> 04:54.466
Although the truth is, I'd rather not.

04:54.716 --> 04:57.736
And not because I don't
think highly of you,

04:57.786 --> 05:01.166
and respect you enormously, I do. But...

05:02.156 --> 05:03.765
Such an unconventional arrangement

05:03.766 --> 05:05.726
it could jeopardize my position here.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.425
And I care about this job,

05:07.426 --> 05:09.856
I don't want to ruin
it by complicating it.

05:11.406 --> 05:12.886
I hope you can understand that.

05:39.586 --> 05:40.266
Good morning.

05:41.086 --> 05:42.266
Coffee's hot.

05:43.826 --> 05:46.866
The American Obstetrics's
dinner is Thursday.

05:46.876 --> 05:48.636
You're speaking last.

05:48.696 --> 05:49.986
I have your notes.

05:50.746 --> 05:52.846
Senator Ronson called twice this morning

05:52.896 --> 05:55.236
and said he will only speak to you.

05:55.536 --> 05:56.316
And...

05:56.616 --> 05:58.356
Also, I wouldn't mind a
moment of your time.

06:02.546 --> 06:03.116
I...

06:04.086 --> 06:05.426
I've thought about...

06:05.436 --> 06:06.356
your proposal.

06:07.546 --> 06:09.776
That the two of us participating
in the study together.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.706
There is no study.

06:12.516 --> 06:14.036
- There...

06:14.037 --> 06:15.556
- I just return from
provost Scully's office.

06:15.616 --> 06:16.856
He inform me that...

06:17.336 --> 06:19.706
someone told him that my sex study

06:19.756 --> 06:23.066
had progress to copulation
between couples.

06:24.316 --> 06:27.136
Which incensed the provost
to such a degree that

06:27.146 --> 06:29.516
he shut down my study as of this morning.

06:29.596 --> 06:31.986
- Who would ever...
- I warned you...

06:32.256 --> 06:33.626
About sleeping with Haas.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.216
I told you it was dangerous
and unprofessional.

06:36.266 --> 06:38.916
I also warned you about
discussing the study with him.

06:38.926 --> 06:40.556
Yet you did both.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.156
Knowing the risks involve...

06:42.206 --> 06:44.496
- Ethan would never...
- You defied me!

06:51.866 --> 06:53.296
You jeopardize the study.

06:53.726 --> 06:55.186
So as a result, you're fired.

06:55.246 --> 06:56.436
I've called Human Resources,

06:56.496 --> 06:59.506
I expect you to sit at your desk
untill your replacement is hired

06:59.786 --> 07:00.796
At which time,

07:00.806 --> 07:03.426
you'll be terminated from the
hospital staff entirely.

07:22.196 --> 07:23.306
Dr. Masters' office.

07:24.796 --> 07:26.156
Yes, this is Mrs. Johnson.

07:30.776 --> 07:32.056
Henry's been suspended?

07:35.106 --> 07:36.906
Oh if you're with Ethan, I'm not...

07:36.986 --> 07:38.056
I'm not with Ethan.

07:38.486 --> 07:40.416
Go ahead, get on your
gown, so we can talk.

07:41.606 --> 07:43.126
I was gonna come by your office.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.926
I want to talk to you in here.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.006
Since I'm now the one that's treating you.

07:47.046 --> 07:48.546
You? What happened to Ethan?

07:48.616 --> 07:53.096
Dr. Haas is not the best
fertility doctor in the Midwest.

07:53.106 --> 07:53.816
I am.

07:54.416 --> 07:56.386
Shouldn't my wife have the very best?

07:57.446 --> 07:59.436
I... I don't understand.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.646
When did this happened?

08:02.426 --> 08:03.005
Why?

08:03.006 --> 08:05.696
It's important for me to know
that I'm doing everything I can.

08:06.006 --> 08:07.206
For you, for us.

08:07.806 --> 08:08.836
To give us a family.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.666
So we need to do a blood panel.

08:10.716 --> 08:11.866
Ethan did a blood panel.

08:11.936 --> 08:13.586
Another blood panel.

08:14.036 --> 08:17.426
Progesterone and luteinizing
hormone are repeated each cycle.

08:17.476 --> 08:18.386
We'll finish the test today

08:18.436 --> 08:20.206
we'll do the cervical capping tomorrow.

08:20.226 --> 08:23.096
I want you on your back
for 16 hours this time.

08:23.106 --> 08:23.975
Feet in the stirrups.

08:23.976 --> 08:25.806
Seditive will help with the discomfort.

08:28.526 --> 08:29.086
All right.

08:30.326 --> 08:33.436
Mabey in a strange way it's romantic.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.515
Two of us together making
a baby through science.

08:36.566 --> 08:38.155
We'll start with a vaginal swab.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.456
In preparation for the saline douche.

08:41.126 --> 08:43.145
Just like an evening out
for dinner and dancing.

08:43.746 --> 08:46.356
It's hardly my best dancing dress, but...

08:48.066 --> 08:49.276
At least it's us.

08:51.786 --> 08:53.606
Actually, Ms. Grant is on duty.

08:55.656 --> 08:58.726
A nurse is perfectly capable of
handling this part of the procedure.

08:59.126 --> 09:00.545
I have an appointment this morning,

09:00.546 --> 09:01.916
but I'll check in on you later.

09:01.956 --> 09:02.856
I promise.

09:05.506 --> 09:06.976
I'm happy about this.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.776
Ready, Mrs. Masters?

09:18.556 --> 09:21.106
Dr. Martins please call pharmacy.

09:21.116 --> 09:23.866
Dr. Martins please call pharmacy.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.296
Why was I taken off your wife's case.

09:32.076 --> 09:33.116
Fine, I'll ask her myself.

09:33.136 --> 09:34.226
You will not.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.306
Instead, you'll do well to remember
your career is in my hands.

09:44.596 --> 09:45.706
What are you talking about?

09:46.726 --> 09:48.885
You are indiscreet and untrustworthy,

09:48.886 --> 09:51.026
two things I will not tolerate.

09:52.536 --> 09:54.356
Is this about your sperm count?

09:54.846 --> 09:56.646
Because I have said nothing to your wife

09:56.656 --> 09:59.186
about why you two are
struggling to conceive.

10:00.296 --> 10:02.836
Although I do think you should
tell her, it's awkward.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.145
Borderline unethical for me to

10:04.146 --> 10:06.276
keep that information from my own patient.

10:06.876 --> 10:08.346
My patient now.

10:38.866 --> 10:40.336
A back door man...

10:40.946 --> 10:42.086
I'm not surprised.

10:45.886 --> 10:48.546
So you lied to your boss, what
you think was gonna happen?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.466
Scully knew there was a study.

10:51.176 --> 10:53.316
Not with people humping in it.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.966
So, what can I do anyway?
Get you back to the...

10:57.106 --> 10:59.046
peep hole with the watching and the timer?

10:59.096 --> 11:00.856
I've been making great
strides at the hospital,

11:00.906 --> 11:03.856
far beyond the observations I...
made here.

11:04.496 --> 11:06.116
I want to continue the work.

11:06.226 --> 11:07.146
Only move it...

11:07.846 --> 11:08.566
Here.

11:11.286 --> 11:13.596
With the machines and all the... wires?

11:14.386 --> 11:15.746
Oh, for the love of God!

11:15.816 --> 11:17.566
I'll pay the women what a customer would,

11:18.156 --> 11:19.136
and I pay the men...

11:19.196 --> 11:19.996
Nothing!

11:20.946 --> 11:22.806
The only men here are Johns,

11:23.046 --> 11:24.486
Johns are our living,

11:24.786 --> 11:27.196
Johns are off limits.

11:29.266 --> 11:30.196
Women only then.

11:30.616 --> 11:32.206
Strictly for masturbation.

11:32.876 --> 11:34.686
And I'll pay them...

11:34.916 --> 11:35.686
Double.

11:37.766 --> 11:38.426
Double

11:38.796 --> 11:40.056
their rate.

11:41.186 --> 11:43.606
And I include a free medical exam.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.066
I can ask Wanda.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.796
She runs her house, she listens to me.

11:48.326 --> 11:49.006
But,

11:51.376 --> 11:53.346
only if you give me a
job in your hospital.

11:55.936 --> 11:56.696
You?

11:59.426 --> 12:02.096
You're utterly unqualified
to work in my office.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.896
Any respectable position will do.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.006
In the hospital?

12:05.826 --> 12:06.456
But why?

12:06.586 --> 12:08.036
It's my business why.

12:08.866 --> 12:09.756
You decide,

12:10.366 --> 12:13.246
if you want your study here... or not.

12:15.966 --> 12:18.996
Mom, Miss Seagal took all
my comic books away,

12:19.096 --> 12:22.006
and I was in the middle of a
really grooming about Binty Vanem.

12:22.136 --> 12:23.026
He could die, Mom!

12:23.096 --> 12:24.536
Henry, I don't want to hear anymore.

12:24.576 --> 12:26.626
This is very serious what you've done.

12:26.896 --> 12:27.986
In what universe

12:28.046 --> 12:30.376
it is Okay for you to
spit on your teacher?

12:30.456 --> 12:31.546
- She took them!
- Shh!

12:32.386 --> 12:33.606
Why can't you think
about what would happen

12:33.656 --> 12:35.466
if you have nowhere to go for three days?

12:38.926 --> 12:41.516
Sit here, where I can see you please.

12:46.236 --> 12:46.917
Is that your son?

12:46.936 --> 12:47.906
It's not your business.

12:49.076 --> 12:51.196
Virginia, the flowers were an apology.

12:51.586 --> 12:53.415
As was my letter, my phone calls,

12:53.416 --> 12:56.066
All I'm trying to do is tell
you how genuinely sorry I am.

12:56.116 --> 12:58.476
For what, exactly? For hitting me?

12:59.276 --> 13:01.606
For going to Scully about the study?

13:01.856 --> 13:03.296
For getting me fired?

13:03.736 --> 13:05.035
Bill fired you? But why?

13:05.036 --> 13:06.806
Gini, I would never go to Scully.

13:07.056 --> 13:09.676
What? Get you fired? I would
never do anything like that.

13:10.276 --> 13:11.316
Stay away from me.

13:12.046 --> 13:12.756
I mean it.

13:14.656 --> 13:17.276
Dr. Sulivan to X-ray room 2.

13:20.206 --> 13:22.586
Excuse me, when did the job start?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.016
Just give me one minute.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.556
Order two movers and a
moving van for tonight.

13:33.616 --> 13:36.506
And I want it kept quiet,
if you can manage that.

13:44.766 --> 13:45.446
Bill...

13:46.926 --> 13:48.896
I feel terrible about this.

13:49.146 --> 13:51.526
All of it, but especially about the study.

13:51.536 --> 13:54.106
And if I contributed in any way,

13:54.356 --> 13:55.926
I could never forgive myself.

13:56.686 --> 13:58.926
But I just spoke to Ethan
and he didn't do it!

13:58.986 --> 14:01.046
He did not know anything about it!

14:07.996 --> 14:08.586
Or...

14:10.756 --> 14:13.006
If this is about us in
the study together...

14:16.716 --> 14:18.006
Then we can sort it out.

14:22.776 --> 14:23.955
I love working here.

14:23.956 --> 14:25.906
You know that, Bill, please...

14:26.036 --> 14:27.355
Please, I need this job.

14:27.356 --> 14:28.816
You can send in the first girl.

14:35.486 --> 14:37.566
Can I at least tell the
movers what they are moving?

14:37.636 --> 14:38.846
I can tell them myself.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.246
I think he liked me.

14:48.436 --> 14:49.886
- Wish me luck!
- Good luck!

15:03.546 --> 15:06.856
We're going home soon, I need you to
put your things back in your bag.

15:17.066 --> 15:17.766
Betty?

15:22.376 --> 15:24.246
Obstetrics, what can I do you for?

15:24.386 --> 15:25.996
"How may I be of assistance"!

15:26.976 --> 15:29.326
Miss DiMello is Dr. Masters' hire.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.756
I do not know about that.

15:31.666 --> 15:32.456
Hold on.

15:33.356 --> 15:35.035
They want to know if
someone got their flowers,

15:35.036 --> 15:36.386
like I'm psychic.

15:37.506 --> 15:39.506
Hello? Yes, I'm sorry.

15:39.576 --> 15:40.356
Is that your kid?

15:40.926 --> 15:42.287
Whom the flowers were you sent to?

15:42.296 --> 15:43.736
Could you spell that for me, please?

15:43.796 --> 15:44.816
Is this your job?

15:48.946 --> 15:50.956
The truth is Virginia
is the one missing out!

15:52.466 --> 15:53.616
I'm perfect for her.

15:54.466 --> 15:55.936
And I'm not going to
be on the market long!

15:55.996 --> 15:58.526
A young doctor, smart, successful...

15:58.596 --> 15:59.656
Not handsome?

15:59.716 --> 16:01.886
My point is: there are many girls

16:01.936 --> 16:04.046
just dying for a catch like me.

16:09.286 --> 16:10.196
For example!

16:12.396 --> 16:13.636
I can't watch this.

16:15.216 --> 16:16.386
Is this seat taken?

16:32.976 --> 16:34.666
Another lamb to slaughter.

16:42.946 --> 16:44.686
I'm very much looking forward to this.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.056
Me too!

17:00.146 --> 17:02.736
Guess you're here for the study?

17:05.036 --> 17:06.546
Nobody told us it moved.

17:06.606 --> 17:07.776
Oh, yeah, it moved all right,

17:07.856 --> 17:09.546
to a cat house on third and Sutter.

17:09.786 --> 17:10.656
To a...

17:14.516 --> 17:16.306
I'm afraid I don't follow.

17:16.376 --> 17:18.915
The higher ups did not
appreciate the Doc.s'

17:19.205 --> 17:21.006
vision or something like that.

17:21.056 --> 17:22.935
But I was so excited about the study.

17:23.546 --> 17:25.215
Seemed so important, you know?

17:25.506 --> 17:27.465
Doing something really great for science.

17:28.136 --> 17:30.897
For the first time of my life I felt
like I was a part of something...

17:31.796 --> 17:32.696
Bigger.

17:33.266 --> 17:34.136
Didn't you?

17:35.356 --> 17:36.046
Bigger,

17:37.296 --> 17:38.226
better.

17:38.376 --> 17:39.246
I'm sad.

17:39.826 --> 17:40.956
Sorry it's over.

17:41.986 --> 17:42.716
Well...

17:44.566 --> 17:45.976
I guess we'll always have in pairs.

17:50.796 --> 17:52.116
You two were in pairs?

17:52.246 --> 17:53.676
This cannot be happening.

17:55.746 --> 17:57.215
I wouldn't ask if I had anywhere else

17:57.216 --> 17:58.196
to put Henry tomorrow.

17:59.716 --> 18:02.136
I have another job in the mornings.

18:02.366 --> 18:04.026
I can't live on my wages here.

18:04.086 --> 18:04.886
I didn't mean that.

18:04.936 --> 18:07.656
Plus you haven't pay me for
the past two weeks as it is.

18:07.976 --> 18:10.096
I'm sorry, of course. I have it!

18:11.826 --> 18:13.066
Would only be through Friday.

18:21.776 --> 18:22.916
What happened to my raise?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.286
I haven't forgotten.

18:24.356 --> 18:26.476
I was planning on starting it next week.

18:28.466 --> 18:31.266
You really can't shift things around
to another job? Just for tomorrow.

18:32.136 --> 18:34.266
You know what I do for my children?

18:35.106 --> 18:37.126
I shift my schedule to be with them.

18:43.896 --> 18:46.456
Watch the rugs, they are real Persian.

18:50.556 --> 18:51.646
Hi, there.

18:52.206 --> 18:53.166
Greetings.

18:53.796 --> 18:54.865
The doc here

18:54.866 --> 18:56.295
will talk us through it

18:56.296 --> 18:58.885
along with the little show
and tell to demostrate

18:58.886 --> 19:01.455
all his tricks.

19:01.456 --> 19:02.466
So...

19:02.506 --> 19:04.206
Someone hop up, volunteer?

19:04.366 --> 19:06.786
What is it, he gonna put
balls in someone's neck?

19:08.296 --> 19:10.076
Maureen, you're a gamer.

19:10.386 --> 19:12.446
Yeah, Maureen, get up there!

19:13.396 --> 19:14.485
Thank you, Maureen.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.116
Please, lie down on the table.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.146
This will allow me to demonstrate the

19:19.156 --> 19:20.596
basic parameter.

19:30.316 --> 19:32.785
All right, then, let's proceed.

19:32.786 --> 19:34.576
You're not gonna climb up here with me?

19:36.136 --> 19:37.046
I'm not.

19:37.906 --> 19:41.146
This, is... an electrocardiogram, um...

19:41.876 --> 19:45.336
basically transthoracic
interpretation of cardiac activity.

19:45.546 --> 19:50.386
And this, is an
electroencephalogram, or EEG

19:50.866 --> 19:54.985
which measures current flow
in the neurons of the brain.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.546
Basically, a big pile of spaghetti.

19:59.376 --> 20:00.766
Well, spaghetti...

20:01.006 --> 20:02.245
allows me to...

20:02.246 --> 20:05.016
scientifically chart emergent patterns

20:05.166 --> 20:07.116
of human sexual response.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.785
Can it fix headaches?

20:11.786 --> 20:14.516
I feel like I got a big
meat cleaver right here.

20:14.556 --> 20:16.515
I wrenched my back twice last week.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.205
It's like razor blades when I pee.

20:18.206 --> 20:20.746
We can attend to your medical
concerns in the physical exam,

20:20.756 --> 20:23.186
but... continuing with
the study, for a moment.

20:23.476 --> 20:25.456
This device...

20:25.726 --> 20:27.936
is used for both...

20:28.286 --> 20:31.225
- stimulation, and... -Oh, hello!

20:31.226 --> 20:32.136
Viewing.

20:32.336 --> 20:34.206
A coochie flashlight?

20:35.846 --> 20:37.685
Had to move ladies, we are coming in.

20:37.686 --> 20:39.785
- Put them on. Let's go.
- Oh, my God, of course.

20:39.786 --> 20:40.365
Good evening.

20:40.366 --> 20:42.586
- Hi, Burt.
- Don't catch a chill, Mau.

20:42.936 --> 20:44.465
- I'll wait for you outside, ladies.
- Um...

20:44.466 --> 20:46.855
- Johns are going in too, buddy.
- I understand the confusion,

20:46.856 --> 20:48.325
but I'm not a John. I'm a doctor.

20:48.326 --> 20:49.295
- Of course you are.
- What...

20:49.296 --> 20:51.216
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

20:58.656 --> 21:00.336
If you relax...

21:00.896 --> 21:02.016
it's fun...

21:02.656 --> 21:03.826
and sexy.

21:03.946 --> 21:05.606
You've done this with other girls?

21:07.576 --> 21:09.046
I'm here with you.

21:09.826 --> 21:11.376
It's you I want.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.616
I guess you do.

21:15.456 --> 21:16.856
Think of it as a kiss.

21:21.706 --> 21:24.375
But isn't the normal way just
to, you know... put it in me?

21:24.376 --> 21:27.026
We will, we'll do that.
We're playing first.

21:31.436 --> 21:33.215
But mother always said not to
put anything in your mouth

21:33.216 --> 21:34.976
if you don't know where it's been.

21:36.326 --> 21:38.036
Well, this has been here since birth.

21:38.816 --> 21:39.746
But...

21:40.426 --> 21:41.975
Let me do it to you first.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.646
I'll show you how good it feels.

21:46.886 --> 21:48.225
Oh, with your mouth?

21:48.226 --> 21:49.466
Right on it?

21:51.026 --> 21:53.126
All right. I'll do you first, okay?

21:54.656 --> 21:55.566
No, I... I...

21:56.046 --> 21:57.606
I don't think you are okay.

21:58.466 --> 21:59.826
No, no, I'm fine.

22:01.066 --> 22:01.956
Here.

22:11.126 --> 22:12.606
Hold on to your hat.

22:15.296 --> 22:16.366
I'm sorry.

22:18.446 --> 22:19.896
I just can't.

22:20.226 --> 22:21.485
I'm willing to...

22:21.486 --> 22:23.126
you know, go all the way.

22:23.466 --> 22:24.906
Why isn't that enough?

22:25.526 --> 22:27.526
It is... it is. It's fine.

22:29.066 --> 22:30.396
Let's just... um...

22:31.476 --> 22:32.905
Let's get you dressed, huh?

22:32.906 --> 22:34.626
So I can take you home.

22:58.096 --> 22:58.976
Bill!

22:59.576 --> 23:01.615
For Christ's sake!

23:01.616 --> 23:03.685
I mean, I'm flattered to be
your first call and all...

23:03.686 --> 23:05.256
I need a favor, Sam.

23:05.326 --> 23:06.366
No kidding.

23:07.036 --> 23:08.585
Look, I can have the bail waived,

23:08.586 --> 23:11.035
but I don't think you needed
the police chief for that.

23:11.036 --> 23:12.956
Not that. Something...

23:13.346 --> 23:14.326
bigger.

23:15.256 --> 23:17.305
My wife would change the lock

23:17.306 --> 23:18.585
as soon she knew I refuse your favor.

23:18.586 --> 23:20.606
It's the only reason I'm agreeing to this.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.215
You know, Flo still crows to everyone

23:22.216 --> 23:24.205
now if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't even have kids.

23:24.206 --> 23:27.256
How is Dennis, Jack and little Sandy?

23:29.426 --> 23:31.526
Well, you get my nuts
on the cup on this one.

23:31.696 --> 23:33.886
But I don't think it's
gonna go so easy with her.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.456
- I can drive if you want.
- No, thanks.

23:45.266 --> 23:47.325
I would prefer control of
the wheel in case I decide

23:47.326 --> 23:49.936
to veer your side of the car into a tree.

23:51.916 --> 23:55.196
Lib, I wasn't in that
brothel as a customer.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.266
You... you were repairing their heating.

24:01.726 --> 24:03.576
Remember I told you I was... um...

24:04.356 --> 24:06.956
starting a study in human sexuality?

24:07.226 --> 24:09.606
Yes, you were characteristically vague.

24:10.126 --> 24:11.846
Well, tonight I was...

24:12.956 --> 24:14.826
simply using the brothel...

24:14.836 --> 24:17.786
as a working laboratory.

24:19.466 --> 24:21.975
But only because the study was
thrown out of the hospital.

24:21.976 --> 24:23.135
You were thrown out of the maternity?

24:23.136 --> 24:24.416
The study was.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.946
Which is a gross overreaction
on Scully's part,

24:28.496 --> 24:30.966
only because I was using human subjects.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.916
I'm progressing onto couple's work.

24:36.716 --> 24:38.696
People were having sex in front of you?

24:40.526 --> 24:41.916
Well, not the prostitutes.

24:42.746 --> 24:44.816
The prostitutes only
masturbate in front of me,

24:44.916 --> 24:47.116
while I watched the monitors...

24:47.216 --> 24:49.776
in order to gather together...

24:49.846 --> 24:51.756
physiological data.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.046
Why didn't you tell me this?

24:57.256 --> 24:58.166
That you're...

24:58.386 --> 25:00.826
watching people have sex? That...

25:02.216 --> 25:04.046
you're working in a brothel?

25:05.636 --> 25:07.866
- Why don't you tell me anything?
- I tell you...

25:07.886 --> 25:10.425
- almost everything.
- No, you tell me...

25:10.426 --> 25:12.585
to schedule dinner with visiting faculty.

25:12.586 --> 25:14.187
I didn't mention it because I thought...

25:14.236 --> 25:16.236
you might judge it harshly.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.816
A part of me wonders...

25:19.526 --> 25:20.826
if it's something at...

25:21.446 --> 25:23.136
home that makes you drawn to this.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.385
Lib, how can you even say...

25:24.386 --> 25:26.546
But then the other part of me knows you.

25:26.966 --> 25:28.976
And I-I know what you
would do for your work,

25:29.496 --> 25:31.796
what you will do in pursuit of it.

25:35.246 --> 25:38.655
It just seems to me that any
study that lands you in jail

25:38.656 --> 25:41.446
is probably not a study that
is good for your career!

25:41.966 --> 25:43.686
Unless it is my career.

25:48.276 --> 25:51.066
Wheelchair assistant to
the E.R waiting room.

25:51.606 --> 25:54.456
Wheelchair assistant to
the E.R waiting room.

25:56.926 --> 25:58.185
Here's money for snack.

25:58.186 --> 26:00.506
All homework must be
finished before comics.

26:00.516 --> 26:02.586
- Before comics, I know.
- Sit here.

26:02.826 --> 26:05.805
I'll check on you in an hour,
do not budge until then.

26:05.806 --> 26:06.736
Okay.

26:11.966 --> 26:13.196
Hello, Betty.

26:14.116 --> 26:15.686
Cute kid.

26:15.856 --> 26:17.915
He'd be cuter if he
hadn't gotten suspended.

26:17.916 --> 26:20.326
Oh, probably just cutting his teeth.

26:21.576 --> 26:23.495
I'm impressed that you convinced

26:23.496 --> 26:25.126
Dr. Masters to get you a job.

26:25.596 --> 26:27.566
He doesn't do many people favors.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.675
I struke a bargain.

26:29.676 --> 26:31.385
He's such a nut for that stupid study,

26:31.386 --> 26:33.096
it's like shooting fish in a barrel.

26:33.606 --> 26:34.896
Is that why, uh...

26:34.916 --> 26:36.335
you weren't at the brothel last night,

26:36.336 --> 26:37.746
you were dealing with your kid?

26:40.816 --> 26:43.995
Dr. Masters has been very good
about giving me time off.

26:43.996 --> 26:45.956
Well, you better get back there fast.

26:46.386 --> 26:47.876
He really needs your help.

26:53.926 --> 26:55.975
Nurse Carlyle please call the switchboard.

26:55.976 --> 26:58.756
Nurse Carlyle please call the switchboard.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.706
You snuck up on me.

27:07.696 --> 27:08.666
How are you?

27:10.406 --> 27:11.996
Now that I see you, great.

27:12.926 --> 27:14.285
Horrible before.

27:14.286 --> 27:16.105
Very up and down. Do you mind?

27:16.106 --> 27:17.206
Oh, of course not, sit.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.406
You look...

27:20.416 --> 27:22.685
I am a lot of things at the moment.

27:22.686 --> 27:23.956
Preoccupied...

27:24.566 --> 27:26.206
there are so much to think about, like...

27:26.466 --> 27:27.956
what you said about study.

27:27.986 --> 27:29.736
A contribution to science...

27:29.866 --> 27:31.746
been cut off so abroadly...

27:32.536 --> 27:33.995
just... seems real shame.

27:33.996 --> 27:35.456
That's just how I feel.

27:37.296 --> 27:38.666
But I also keep thinking...

27:40.096 --> 27:41.755
It's not like Bill Masters holds the key

27:41.756 --> 27:43.466
to all scientific advancement.

27:44.486 --> 27:46.645
I mean, after all, I'm also a doctor.

27:46.646 --> 27:47.865
Great, bones or...

27:47.866 --> 27:48.895
Orthopaedics. My point is,

27:48.896 --> 27:50.826
we can still continue the study.

27:53.056 --> 27:53.966
Just the...

27:54.016 --> 27:55.066
two of us.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.076
You mean have sex together.

28:01.396 --> 28:02.276
Sure...

28:03.746 --> 28:05.526
- Why not.
- Because you're married.

28:06.806 --> 28:09.875
Yeah, ok, yes, but I was also
married when I was in the study.

28:09.876 --> 28:12.335
We were in the study because
it was for science.

28:12.336 --> 28:13.936
This is also for science...

28:14.926 --> 28:16.816
just more like home studies.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.785
If you were having a contest
for the most sexual

28:21.786 --> 28:24.616
adventurous girl in the
hospital, who would win?

28:25.116 --> 28:27.146
- That's a dumb game.
- Play anyway.

28:27.946 --> 28:28.936
Do you mind?

28:29.656 --> 28:32.086
You play too, since you
certainly know the field.

28:32.146 --> 28:34.246
- What would you say?
- Don't answer that.

28:34.396 --> 28:36.045
Any guess would be based on idol gossip

28:36.046 --> 28:38.465
which is ofte inaccurate and always mean.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.766
Gossip's been around thousands
of years for a reason.

28:41.416 --> 28:44.176
- Austin...
- Jesus Christ, Ethan, go...

28:44.876 --> 28:46.196
bother Bernadette.

28:50.626 --> 28:52.015
I don't know Bernadette.

28:52.016 --> 28:53.825
She works in Food and Beverage.

28:53.826 --> 28:55.655
And Daniels, in Radiology, is assured me

28:55.656 --> 28:56.585
she's pretty much a total s...

28:56.586 --> 28:58.005
Is that true, was she a total slut?

28:58.006 --> 28:59.426
I am not having this discussion.

28:59.716 --> 29:03.136
- But how slutty, exactly?
- Would you find out for yourself?

29:03.786 --> 29:06.295
I'm in middle of a serious
conversation with Jane.

29:06.296 --> 29:09.106
And I was perfectly happy here
reading without either of you.

29:11.996 --> 29:13.375
"The Second Sex"?

29:13.376 --> 29:14.666
Is that book is, uh...

29:15.466 --> 29:17.326
provocating as it sounds?

29:18.496 --> 29:19.816
Oh yes.

29:20.016 --> 29:21.246
Would you like to hear?

29:22.156 --> 29:24.195
- I would.
- Yeah, yeah.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.606
Then listen carefully.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.915
"One day it will be possible for a
woman to love from her strength...

29:29.916 --> 29:31.406
and not her weakness.

29:31.816 --> 29:34.836
Not to escape from herself,
but to find herself.

29:35.426 --> 29:37.595
Not to utter resignation,
but to affirm herself.

29:37.596 --> 29:40.856
Only then will love become for
her as it is for the man...

29:41.136 --> 29:42.406
a source of life...

29:43.286 --> 29:44.906
and not a mortal danger."

29:50.916 --> 29:51.866
What?

29:54.946 --> 29:56.046
Hello, Bill.

29:56.716 --> 29:58.716
Guess you can't dodge me forever.

29:58.956 --> 29:59.786
You know, uh...

30:00.056 --> 30:02.765
I heard a hell of a rumor, I
hope to God it's not true.

30:02.766 --> 30:04.615
God did well in being so gossip.

30:04.616 --> 30:06.175
Did you move that study of yours

30:06.176 --> 30:08.575
to a cathouse on the corner
of Third and Sutter?

30:08.576 --> 30:10.695
I see you've been chatting
up our new receptionist.

30:10.696 --> 30:11.295
You are out of your mind!

30:11.296 --> 30:13.235
Wherever we've moved, It's your doing.

30:13.236 --> 30:15.826
Oh, no. Do lay this one at my feet.

30:16.146 --> 30:19.445
I know you're angry, you feel
I'm being unnecessarily harsh,

30:19.446 --> 30:21.835
But I didn't spent 15 years...

30:21.836 --> 30:23.075
grooming your career

30:23.076 --> 30:24.855
so you can piss it away on hookers!

30:24.856 --> 30:26.756
I want the study back into the hospital

30:27.326 --> 30:29.605
Well, get rid the lie of couples
act and I'll consider it.

30:29.606 --> 30:31.955
Let the study back into the
hospital with no restrictions.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.365
I just give you my restrictions.

30:33.366 --> 30:34.665
Let the study back into the hospital

30:34.666 --> 30:36.876
with no restrictions and
additional funding.

30:38.146 --> 30:40.535
- That's not how you bargain.
- I'm not bargaining.

30:40.536 --> 30:43.095
See, this is your problem, you know that.

30:43.096 --> 30:44.695
You put on a suit of armor...

30:44.696 --> 30:46.455
to attack a plate of whipped cream.

30:46.456 --> 30:47.936
Whipped cream my ass.

30:57.776 --> 30:59.886
Something just came up at the last moment.

30:59.896 --> 31:01.696
But you promised!

31:02.006 --> 31:04.446
I didn't know that I had to work tonight.

31:04.496 --> 31:08.026
But it's the very last
issue of "Race to Space".

31:08.266 --> 31:10.676
- I want to read it with you.
- You will,

31:10.726 --> 31:13.316
Henry, we will read it
together, I promise.

31:14.026 --> 31:16.046
Tonight just got a little complicated.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.366
It's always complicated.

31:53.826 --> 31:54.995
This is either the smartest

31:54.996 --> 31:56.546
or the stupidest thing I've ever done.

32:00.816 --> 32:02.065
Where'd you stashed the kids?

32:02.066 --> 32:05.785
At home with the baby-sitter, the
one informed me she's quitting.

32:05.786 --> 32:08.295
Something about me being an unfit mother.

32:08.296 --> 32:09.706
Everyone's a critic.

32:09.916 --> 32:11.125
We probably get some time

32:11.126 --> 32:13.536
before the doc arrives,
I can gather the girls.

32:13.706 --> 32:15.386
It's just like a regular kitchen.

32:17.826 --> 32:20.876
Sorry, I've never been
in a brothel before.

32:22.186 --> 32:25.386
Normally we got naked coochies
lined up along the sink,

32:25.576 --> 32:26.566
but it's low.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.616
You see, this works better
if we have a schedule.

32:31.596 --> 32:32.506
So...

32:33.116 --> 32:34.855
We'll switch off between study...

32:34.856 --> 32:36.035
That's with the wires

32:36.036 --> 32:38.445
and doctor Masters' monitoring
and taking measurements...

32:38.446 --> 32:41.265
I haven't seen a doctor in years.
So that's why I'm doing this...

32:41.266 --> 32:44.026
No, I've decided. I'm out.

32:45.506 --> 32:47.346
But why? Why not participate?

32:47.356 --> 32:48.736
Because it's weird.

32:49.516 --> 32:50.746
He's weird.

32:52.296 --> 32:53.575
And pus, it seems like the more we help...

32:53.576 --> 32:56.556
- What's she doing here?
- Saving your bacon.

32:56.836 --> 32:58.316
Not true. It's a fair trade.

32:58.456 --> 33:00.396
He even paid for your time last night.

33:01.466 --> 33:02.946
And the real truth is...

33:04.496 --> 33:05.905
People are clueless about sex.

33:05.906 --> 33:07.805
You ladies, you are the experts.

33:07.806 --> 33:09.095
Doctor Masters was smart enough

33:09.096 --> 33:11.545
to see that if he's going to
help educate people about sex,

33:11.546 --> 33:13.116
he should first come to you.

33:13.386 --> 33:14.916
They should learn from the best.

33:21.356 --> 33:23.516
Could fill a book with what we know.

33:24.146 --> 33:27.045
But maybe it can even help
people, a study like that.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.916
Maybe it can even help the
doc have sex himself.

33:32.436 --> 33:35.575
He reminds me of that one Johnny who
used to screwed with the shoes on.

33:35.576 --> 33:37.936
He even didn't take his bow tie off.

33:38.256 --> 33:40.966
He is the best women's doctor
in the Midwest, trust me.

33:41.076 --> 33:43.356
If you need help, you can count on him.

33:46.086 --> 33:48.116
The Midwest miracle now!

33:48.866 --> 33:49.886
Ladies.

33:50.666 --> 33:52.826
Betty go gather the
others, so we can begin.

33:53.426 --> 33:54.796
But I do have some news.

33:55.426 --> 33:57.445
I struck a deal with the...

33:57.446 --> 33:58.866
chief of police.

33:59.696 --> 34:00.856
As long as I'm working here,

34:00.866 --> 34:04.246
you'll be spared any and
all police interference.

34:06.486 --> 34:07.816
No more raids.

34:12.616 --> 34:13.576
Sorry.

34:13.746 --> 34:16.536
Flip me over. Take me from behind.

34:17.476 --> 34:18.485
Okay.

34:22.076 --> 34:23.476
You like it in the rear?

34:24.266 --> 34:25.485
You mean back seat?

34:25.496 --> 34:27.545
No, I mean my rear.

34:28.846 --> 34:30.025
No, this is fine.

34:30.056 --> 34:31.505
Oh, it's more than fine.

34:31.775 --> 34:33.025
Oh, right there...

34:33.025 --> 34:34.585
Right there again...

34:43.056 --> 34:44.386
My back's kinda cramping.

34:46.476 --> 34:48.916
Looks like someone's a little out of gas.

34:49.176 --> 34:50.196
I'm sorry.

34:50.916 --> 34:52.045
Don't worry.

34:52.096 --> 34:55.426
I can blow that back in a
fighting shape in no time.

35:08.866 --> 35:10.446
Does it feel good?

35:15.406 --> 35:18.496
Faster? Slower? I can do both.

35:25.516 --> 35:27.796
Either is fine. Thanks.

35:37.876 --> 35:39.315
My mother died of a brain tumor,

35:39.316 --> 35:41.566
so when I started getting headaches...

35:41.656 --> 35:42.756
I knew.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.206
How many fingers?

35:45.266 --> 35:46.166
Three?

35:46.966 --> 35:48.576
- How many now?
- Three.

35:52.996 --> 35:54.836
I was only 12 when she died.

35:55.706 --> 35:57.536
She suffered so badly.

35:58.086 --> 36:00.186
I'm afraid of dying like that.

36:00.416 --> 36:02.175
I have to do some research.

36:02.176 --> 36:04.895
But until then, do you
know the expression...

36:04.896 --> 36:06.326
don't borrow trouble?

36:07.816 --> 36:08.796
Don't.

36:10.606 --> 36:12.606
Got the schedule for the rest of the week.

36:13.726 --> 36:17.716
I've condensed physical exams
down to tonight and tomorrow.

36:17.746 --> 36:19.576
The rest of the night are for the study.

36:20.386 --> 36:24.126
You now have 19 of the women
signed up and ready to go.

36:30.766 --> 36:32.746
You didn't ask me here tonight, Bill.

36:34.166 --> 36:35.366
I'm aware of that.

36:37.476 --> 36:38.846
Thank you for...

36:39.966 --> 36:41.466
handling the girls.

36:44.126 --> 36:45.166
You can go now.

37:04.206 --> 37:05.206
Betty.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.016
Betty!

37:09.896 --> 37:12.856
Men get to yell in here for one
reason and one reason only.

37:12.886 --> 37:14.016
Where is the next girl?

37:14.046 --> 37:16.986
Ask nicely and I'll tell you.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.686
Where's the next girl?

37:19.806 --> 37:21.586
We're done. Except...

37:22.696 --> 37:25.706
I wanna ask you something... a request.

37:26.206 --> 37:28.935
It's irresponsible. Not to mention stupid.

37:28.936 --> 37:31.495
Why would you want to reverse
your tubal ligation?

37:31.496 --> 37:33.575
I do not know, genius. To have kids!

37:33.576 --> 37:35.555
But why on God's earth
would you want have kids!

37:35.556 --> 37:37.566
You're a lesbian and a prostitute.

37:37.676 --> 37:38.735
A little respect.

37:38.736 --> 37:40.026
You didn't answer the question.

37:40.176 --> 37:41.865
Again, that's my business.

37:41.866 --> 37:44.195
No, it's my business if
ask me to operate on you.

37:44.196 --> 37:46.955
I would like it done
sooner rather than later.

37:46.956 --> 37:48.226
I am not doing it at all.

37:57.206 --> 37:58.476
Hey! Hey!

37:58.786 --> 38:00.836
Did you know how much that costs?

38:00.876 --> 38:02.626
Not much, busted.

38:03.096 --> 38:05.975
It's like this, the girls
think you're odd...

38:05.976 --> 38:09.015
They'd be glad to see your
shit on the sidewalk,

38:09.016 --> 38:10.346
which is where it will be.

38:11.396 --> 38:14.486
So you are just gonna blackmail
me every time you want something?

38:15.816 --> 38:16.616
Look at that...

38:17.556 --> 38:19.256
You're smart after all.

38:24.526 --> 38:25.996
How's it going with the study?

38:28.856 --> 38:29.736
Fine.

38:32.126 --> 38:33.276
What did you do tonight?

38:35.946 --> 38:37.836
I'm still setting it up.

38:39.046 --> 38:40.796
That doesn't paint much of a picture.

38:42.996 --> 38:43.946
All right...

38:46.426 --> 38:48.505
Part of my arrangement

38:48.506 --> 38:50.306
in turns to having the studies there...

38:51.236 --> 38:52.506
At the brothel.

38:53.086 --> 38:54.206
At the brothel.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.516
Is the girls get free medical care.

38:59.036 --> 39:01.525
I looked at one girl's tonsils tonight

39:01.526 --> 39:02.916
They need to come up

39:03.576 --> 39:06.346
- Another girl had bunions.
- Where?

39:06.496 --> 39:07.656
Where did she in?

39:13.826 --> 39:15.856
No naked bodies. No sex.

39:16.326 --> 39:19.566
Tonight was simply paying the piper.

39:23.146 --> 39:24.926
But, when you do watch...

39:25.266 --> 39:26.196
It must be...

39:27.916 --> 39:28.916
sexy.

39:31.896 --> 39:33.286
It's work.

39:35.156 --> 39:38.106
It's not even a tiny bit erotic?

39:41.026 --> 39:42.456
Why are you asking me?

39:46.936 --> 39:49.516
I guess I'm asking...

39:50.656 --> 39:52.316
if you like to watch.

39:55.146 --> 39:56.416
Because if you do...

39:58.336 --> 39:59.526
you can watch me.

40:36.726 --> 40:37.996
Stop. Don't, don't.

40:41.146 --> 40:42.916
I love you too much.

40:48.386 --> 40:49.736
You don't have to do this.

41:11.256 --> 41:14.175
Mrs. Johnson, I left the next
bench of secretary candidates

41:14.176 --> 41:15.205
in the office.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.166
Thank you.

41:16.396 --> 41:19.236
Has Dr. Masters liked
none of the applicants?

41:19.746 --> 41:22.386
He's extremely particular.

41:22.816 --> 41:25.066
He's gonna to land on someone eventually.

41:26.676 --> 41:27.786
Isn't he?

41:37.976 --> 41:40.535
Ladies, I'm afraid I have bad news.

41:40.536 --> 41:42.716
The position has been filled.

41:51.316 --> 41:52.556
Sorry about the job.

41:52.566 --> 41:54.046
I had fingers crossed and everything.

41:54.096 --> 41:55.105
But thanks, it's not your fault.

41:55.106 --> 41:56.436
I looked at your resume.

41:56.616 --> 41:59.186
Have you ever considered the
position of caring for children?

42:04.366 --> 42:05.556
Coffee is ready.

42:12.276 --> 42:13.786
I've been thinking about you,

42:13.796 --> 42:15.025
about us, in fact.

42:15.026 --> 42:16.256
Aren't you late for work?

42:16.336 --> 42:17.606
I may have told you...

42:18.106 --> 42:21.525
much of my recent research suggests...

42:21.526 --> 42:22.336
stress...

42:22.526 --> 42:24.786
might play a significant role

42:25.326 --> 42:26.516
in fertility.

42:28.946 --> 42:30.336
So it occured to me,

42:31.746 --> 42:35.046
there is no reason why
we can't do the capping

42:35.396 --> 42:36.626
right here, at home.

42:37.446 --> 42:39.105
I'll take your temperature this morning,

42:39.106 --> 42:40.285
and if we'are good to go,

42:40.286 --> 42:42.105
I can cap in your own bedroom,

42:42.106 --> 42:43.135
you can rest here

42:43.136 --> 42:45.255
- comfortably all day, I'll check in on...
- Bill...

42:45.256 --> 42:46.535
At lunch time. I'm happy to do it.

42:46.536 --> 42:48.556
I want Ethan back as my doctor.

42:56.776 --> 42:58.425
- That's not gonna happen.
- Why not?

42:58.426 --> 42:59.845
Ethan is an excellent doctor

42:59.846 --> 43:02.456
and you have said yourself
he is your protege.

43:03.906 --> 43:04.986
It's what I want.

43:06.666 --> 43:09.235
To be honest, I do not know why he
was taken off my case to begin with.

43:09.236 --> 43:11.056
- You're my wife.
- Exactly.

43:11.216 --> 43:13.396
And we need to keep our home and this...

43:13.976 --> 43:15.715
problem of ours separate.

43:15.716 --> 43:18.225
Libby, I cannot abide it.
I am the better doctor.

43:18.226 --> 43:20.585
If you don't want the capping here

43:20.586 --> 43:23.056
that's fine, the hospital is also good.

43:26.196 --> 43:27.316
I want Ethan.

43:30.536 --> 43:31.416
Bill...

43:31.926 --> 43:34.646
I wake up and try and be happy...

43:34.876 --> 43:36.576
and hopeful every day.

43:36.966 --> 43:39.495
But I also know that I'm barren.

43:39.496 --> 43:41.946
And the most basic thing
in a woman's life is...

43:46.626 --> 43:48.646
I can't fail you as both a wife

43:48.716 --> 43:49.946
and a patient.

43:53.876 --> 43:55.736
I love you too much for that.

44:00.496 --> 44:01.366
All right.

44:24.006 --> 44:25.506
I need some good news.

44:27.236 --> 44:29.136
Well you might consider this good.

44:32.096 --> 44:33.636
I thought about your proposal.

44:34.576 --> 44:36.486
The two of us in the study

44:36.746 --> 44:38.096
together and...

44:40.416 --> 44:41.876
I think it's good idea.

44:44.546 --> 44:45.936
It's good for the study.

44:46.376 --> 44:47.956
And it's good for science.

44:50.126 --> 44:51.906
It's also good for something else.

44:58.986 --> 45:01.456
If you can sign these, I can
get them up for tonight.

45:14.766 --> 45:17.066
Where's the next secretarial candidate?

45:17.686 --> 45:19.196
There isn't one.

45:21.116 --> 45:23.846
HR's been very slow sending them up today.

45:27.216 --> 45:29.166
I need you to talk to Betty tonight.

45:29.746 --> 45:30.626
About?

45:31.756 --> 45:34.086
She has some harebrained ideas.

45:34.906 --> 45:37.436
An undergoing of tubal reversal.

45:38.646 --> 45:40.396
I told her it's ridiculous.

45:40.936 --> 45:43.036
But I can't outright refuse her.

45:43.856 --> 45:44.766
Because...

45:45.346 --> 45:46.696
Just talk her out of it.

45:48.506 --> 45:49.536
You have children.

45:50.986 --> 45:53.345
Explain to her how hopelessly
ill-equipped she is

45:53.346 --> 45:56.306
to undertake such a
enormous responsibility.

46:00.306 --> 46:02.296
The headaches are worse today.

46:05.316 --> 46:07.536
I know what you're gonna
and say it's okay.

46:08.356 --> 46:09.736
It's scary, but...

46:10.946 --> 46:12.806
I've had a OK life.

46:20.036 --> 46:21.506
How many fingers?

46:23.196 --> 46:24.576
Oh, my God.

46:25.396 --> 46:27.106
- Four.
- Four.

46:27.696 --> 46:30.706
The just needed glasses, that's all.
You are gonna be fine.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.616
No, no.

46:37.766 --> 46:39.516
That'll just fogged up the lens.

46:40.686 --> 46:42.076
You saved my life.

46:42.376 --> 46:43.846
I saved your eyes.

46:43.996 --> 46:45.235
Which is still impressive

46:45.236 --> 46:48.175
given my last class of
ophthalmology was 16 years ago.

46:48.176 --> 46:49.936
How can I pay you back?

46:50.876 --> 46:53.366
Would you like a blowjob?
It's on the house.

46:55.686 --> 46:57.776
Thank you. No, but...

46:58.316 --> 46:59.276
Thank you.

47:04.526 --> 47:06.266
He should give you a raise.

47:07.716 --> 47:09.026
Dr Masters said that

47:09.036 --> 47:11.785
you're considering a tubal reversal.

47:11.786 --> 47:13.105
Not considering. Either he does it,

47:13.106 --> 47:15.206
or I kick his study onto the street.

47:18.976 --> 47:20.946
He asked you to talk me out of it.

47:23.296 --> 47:24.186
Such a pest.

47:24.206 --> 47:26.595
I think he's concern is...

47:26.596 --> 47:29.476
This isn't the best
environment to raise a child.

47:29.866 --> 47:31.256
A whore house?

47:31.796 --> 47:32.786
You think?

47:40.816 --> 47:42.086
I met a guy.

47:43.496 --> 47:44.376
At, erm...

47:45.136 --> 47:46.546
At church.

47:47.016 --> 47:48.426
Of all places.

47:50.066 --> 47:52.046
We became friendly and...

47:52.666 --> 47:53.896
I'm thinking...

47:54.506 --> 47:55.645
He doesn't know what I do,

47:55.646 --> 47:57.536
so sure, I seem like a nice girl.

47:59.526 --> 48:01.246
He asked me to dinner.

48:04.786 --> 48:06.176
His, his car is...

48:06.866 --> 48:08.456
Very fancy.

48:09.356 --> 48:12.196
And that's when I get it out of him...
He's rich.

48:12.466 --> 48:14.876
He made a fortune in pretzel.

48:15.426 --> 48:16.806
He's the Pretzel King.

48:17.166 --> 48:18.906
The original Pretzel King?

48:19.956 --> 48:21.186
He wants to marry me!

48:21.416 --> 48:23.946
A nice girl who works in a hospital...

48:25.166 --> 48:26.616
Have a bunch of kids.

48:27.516 --> 48:29.296
Turns out, he's crazy about me.

48:30.546 --> 48:33.476
But I thought you were crazy about Helen.

48:37.286 --> 48:38.286
I...

48:38.756 --> 48:39.826
I love Helen.

48:40.726 --> 48:41.756
But...

48:42.456 --> 48:44.826
She understands why I am doing this.

48:44.856 --> 48:45.866
And...

48:47.076 --> 48:48.776
She wants what's best for me.

48:50.506 --> 48:52.406
But it is really what's best for children?

48:53.776 --> 48:57.076
I mean I have them, I know what
it's like to raise them alone.

48:57.086 --> 48:58.276
I would not be alone!

48:59.246 --> 49:01.976
When everything with this
guy goes perfectly...

49:02.476 --> 49:04.006
Which it always does.

49:05.066 --> 49:07.326
This is a shot.

49:07.716 --> 49:10.046
At something good,

49:10.946 --> 49:11.826
normal...

49:13.156 --> 49:15.446
maybe even happy.

49:16.306 --> 49:17.765
Why shouldn't I take it?

49:17.766 --> 49:19.466
Well, you shouldn't take it lightly.

49:20.366 --> 49:22.576
Kids were incredibly tough.

49:22.846 --> 49:24.906
So why do you have them
if they're such a burden?

49:29.936 --> 49:34.006
I, because I knew that I
would feel like a failure...

49:34.856 --> 49:36.166
If I didn't have children.

49:36.866 --> 49:38.336
And I also knew that...

49:40.096 --> 49:41.435
If I'm being perfectly honest,

49:41.436 --> 49:44.826
I knew that they would
probably be the only thing...

49:46.006 --> 49:48.096
I could truly love.

49:49.436 --> 49:50.326
So...

49:51.386 --> 49:52.576
You deserve that...

49:53.866 --> 49:55.176
And I don't.

50:04.516 --> 50:05.665
What do you say?

50:05.666 --> 50:08.546
I am saying you should
reconsider the surgery.

50:08.936 --> 50:10.485
I told you to talk her out of it!

50:10.486 --> 50:12.386
She's met a man and wants children.

50:13.836 --> 50:14.575
Of course she's met a man,

50:14.576 --> 50:15.615
she's met hundreds of men!

50:15.616 --> 50:17.065
Why would this one be any different?

50:17.066 --> 50:18.736
Why are you asking, Bill?

50:19.436 --> 50:21.106
This doesn't even sound like you.

50:22.556 --> 50:24.605
How many times have you said
when it comes to science

50:24.606 --> 50:26.116
there is no room for God?

50:26.656 --> 50:28.005
Science simply is,

50:28.006 --> 50:29.336
the data tell us the story,

50:29.376 --> 50:32.556
and should be free from all
judgment and all censor.

50:33.016 --> 50:35.466
Isn't that why you refuse
to give up on your study?

50:36.096 --> 50:39.356
'Cause you believe in this journey
in following the science,

50:39.366 --> 50:41.066
no matter where it leads?

50:55.046 --> 50:57.336
I know you're keeping me
hanging deliberately.

50:58.856 --> 51:02.725
Punishing me for my transgressions
which I probably deserve,

51:02.726 --> 51:03.236
but...

51:05.316 --> 51:08.776
Can we speak honestly about
what's really going on here?

51:14.506 --> 51:15.496
I don't follow.

51:23.206 --> 51:25.336
Well, the truth is you
need me in the study.

51:26.276 --> 51:27.346
And you know it.

51:28.876 --> 51:31.056
So am I rehired, yes or no?

51:37.776 --> 51:39.166
You'll have a job tomorrow.

51:39.946 --> 51:41.096
Beyond that...

51:42.306 --> 51:43.936
I really can not tell the future.

52:11.096 --> 52:12.936
They were a dream, really.

52:13.216 --> 52:14.655
Tess and I have played dolls.

52:14.656 --> 52:16.716
Miss Revlon won the
swimmingsuit competition.

52:16.906 --> 52:18.805
And Henry and I had been a greatest time.

52:18.806 --> 52:20.846
He didn't hound you about his comics?

52:20.856 --> 52:22.786
Oh, he did. All night.

52:23.126 --> 52:25.706
So we read the latest issue
of "Race to Space" together.

52:25.716 --> 52:26.866
It was so good.

52:27.876 --> 52:29.116
What a story!

52:29.146 --> 52:31.085
The future of science and all...

52:31.086 --> 52:32.196
It is so revetting.

52:32.626 --> 52:34.956
I'm gonna get the entire
series for my nephew.

52:38.056 --> 52:40.036
You have the nicest kids, Virginia.

52:40.306 --> 52:42.286
Despite what that teacher says.

52:44.486 --> 52:46.116
So, tomorrow...

52:46.656 --> 52:48.516
- 8 a.m. until...
- Late.

52:48.706 --> 52:50.446
I have to work again.

52:50.876 --> 52:52.236
It's fine with me.

52:52.856 --> 52:54.476
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

53:22.136 --> 53:23.836
"On earth he had been different."

53:25.056 --> 53:27.106
"Others had not understood him."

53:27.926 --> 53:29.396
"He had been lonely."

53:33.716 --> 53:36.126
"But now he found himself between worlds."

53:36.676 --> 53:39.086
"The earth, a tiny dot behind him."

53:39.486 --> 53:41.866
"The moon, a tiny dot ahead."

53:44.166 --> 53:47.446
"When he got to the moon, would
it be everything he dreamed of?"

53:48.106 --> 53:50.726
"And would it be worth
everything he had left behind?"
