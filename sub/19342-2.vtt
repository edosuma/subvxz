00:08.533 --> 00:10.934
Previously on "Billions"...

00:10.934 --> 00:13.100
An investigation has begun
into your office,

00:13.100 --> 00:16.300
and the man leading the
investigation -- Oliver Dake.

00:16.300 --> 00:19.867
The payment that your wife
received from Axelrod,

00:19.867 --> 00:21.467
it may not be a bribe,

00:21.467 --> 00:23.433
but, dang,
if it doesn't look like one.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.633
Well, Lawrence Boyd pissed
right in my face.

00:25.633 --> 00:28.300
He didn't show.
What the hell do we do now?

00:28.300 --> 00:31.133
Bobby Axelrod could run
through the Serengeti

00:31.133 --> 00:32.600
and not break a sweat.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.567
You do what you do
just as well as him.

00:35.567 --> 00:36.834
Maybe better.

00:36.834 --> 00:39.400
You can't allow yourself
to get drawn in

00:39.400 --> 00:41.567
to an unwinnable fight.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.734
Victory will be swift.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.567
That will save us ten million
on this trade.

00:46.567 --> 00:48.166
This is why I need to keep you.

00:48.166 --> 00:50.033
I'd believe the same thing
were I you.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.900
-Whoa!
-You've been served.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.567
-With a lawsuit?
-One hundred and twenty seven
of them.

00:54.567 --> 00:57.033
Wendy was at Krakow
Capital earlier today.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.867
You have an amazing
level of insight

00:58.867 --> 01:01.467
-into how we hedgies think.
-Yes.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.800
I don't mean Axe Capital.
I mean Bobby himself.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.467
-He was looking to hire you?
-Yeah.

01:06.467 --> 01:09.533
That motherfucker is just trying
to poach my most valued --

01:09.533 --> 01:11.266
I'm not your anything.

01:11.266 --> 01:14.200
We handle ourselves and Chuck
gives someone Head of Crim.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.300
Or we cooperate with Dake
and try our luck

01:16.300 --> 01:18.200
starting over with
Chuck's replacement.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.467
You know what Rhoades is.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.300
You know he should be
out of the job.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.867
That was the attorney general.

01:22.867 --> 01:24.600
She's summoned me
to Washington,

01:24.600 --> 01:26.800
where she will
greet me warmly,

01:26.800 --> 01:28.967
and then she'll fire me.

01:35.033 --> 01:38.467
♪ dramatic music plays ♪

01:46.500 --> 01:48.400
There was a moment in time

01:48.400 --> 01:51.066
when the only two people
who knew what it was to fly

01:51.066 --> 01:53.200
were the Wright Brothers.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.000
And we are like them
in a way.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.633
Although
we have to stay airborne

01:57.633 --> 01:59.300
a lot longer
than nine seconds,

01:59.300 --> 02:01.734
we and have to go into much
thinner air when we do.

02:01.734 --> 02:05.100
But how do you do it,
Todd?

02:05.100 --> 02:07.600
How do you stay aloft?

02:07.600 --> 02:12.233
One of the nine poets,
Pindar, said it best.

02:12.233 --> 02:16.266
Become who you are
by learning who you are.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.166
You wouldn't know Pindar
from Pantera,

02:19.166 --> 02:21.533
yet you act like you read
the Harvard shelf

02:21.533 --> 02:22.934
with your morning oatmeal.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.700
Who wrote this shit for you?

02:24.700 --> 02:27.100
Lawrence Boyd, I respect you

02:27.100 --> 02:29.000
more than anyone
in this game.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.500
But the idea that Todd Krakow
or anyone else but you here

02:32.500 --> 02:35.300
is a thought leader
just because they've got

02:35.300 --> 02:37.600
a few dollars in their pocket
is laughable!

02:37.600 --> 02:38.967
Let me respond.

02:38.967 --> 02:41.166
It's a sad fact
of the business today.

02:41.166 --> 02:44.700
Hedge funds like Axelrod's,
they're out of ideas,

02:44.700 --> 02:45.867
so they cut corners

02:45.867 --> 02:47.800
and go looking
for that black edge.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.300
But I'm good enough

02:49.300 --> 02:51.467
that I didn't have
to get close to the line.

02:51.467 --> 02:52.567
Really?

02:52.567 --> 02:54.567
What about
the $45 million in fines

02:54.567 --> 02:55.867
you paid to the U.K.?

02:55.867 --> 02:57.734
That --

02:57.734 --> 02:59.967
No one understands
those laws.

02:59.967 --> 03:04.400
Larry, you ever found yourself
afoul of British law?

03:04.400 --> 03:08.333
No, some of us have never run
afoul of any international laws.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.166
Larry, you have teams
of lawyers at Spartan-Ives

03:11.166 --> 03:13.266
and locals in those
countries who ensure

03:13.266 --> 03:15.166
you don't get screwed
the way I did.

03:15.166 --> 03:18.166
Oh, okay, okay, okay,
I'm only the referee here,

03:18.166 --> 03:22.667
not taking sides,
but you overstepped.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.934
Apologies.

03:24.934 --> 03:26.600
And let that
be the first apology,

03:26.600 --> 03:28.133
not the last,
to this audience,

03:28.133 --> 03:30.266
who have paid three grand
for the privilege

03:30.266 --> 03:31.800
of hearing
your barbaric yawp.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.533
-Axe, Axe, Axe.
-Here's a thought.

03:33.533 --> 03:35.934
If any of you  want
to continue the conversation,

03:35.934 --> 03:37.834
I'll be over by the bar
with my team.

03:37.834 --> 03:40.266
Sure -- hit, run,
and hide, huh?

03:40.266 --> 03:43.767
You been showing the SEC
the same moves for years.

03:43.767 --> 03:46.266
But, eventually,
they catch you.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.633
Krakow, whatever
cocktail party tutor

03:50.633 --> 03:52.533
you used to prep you
for this panel

03:52.533 --> 03:54.867
owes you
a goddamn refund.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.166
Well, that was stimulating.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.800
Okay, okay, let's move on.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.400
Tag, Global warming...

04:03.400 --> 04:05.800
I called the car around
so you can go.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.600
Why would I leave now?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.734
That's what you get for trying
to steal my fucking employees.

04:11.734 --> 04:14.934
Don't blame me
for your fuck-up.

04:14.934 --> 04:17.100
Word of advice, Axe --

04:17.100 --> 04:19.266
you don't want to lose a
valuable asset,

04:19.266 --> 04:23.600
don't let her walk
out the door, huh?

04:28.700 --> 04:30.500
Here comes Boyd.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.433
Sorry about your panel.

04:38.433 --> 04:41.033
Sorry. The only reason you put
Ric Flair in the ring

04:41.033 --> 04:42.767
is to get that heat
from the crowd.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.800
I didn't pick that panel
by accident.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.166
I knew you'd incinerate it.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.834
You just made sure
Spartan-Ives

04:47.834 --> 04:50.800
is all the Street's talking
about for the rest of the month.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.500
They'll be killing themselves
they weren't in the room.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.667
And the only way
they get in there next year

04:55.667 --> 04:57.300
is by making you
their prime.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.100
I'm the bull,
you're the red sash every time.

05:04.934 --> 05:07.767
Hey, Chuck.
Come in.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.734
I drove by Katz's
on the way here.

05:09.734 --> 05:12.266
Oh.
You're killing me, man.

05:12.266 --> 05:14.633
No?
Well, I'm going in.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.233
Uh-huh.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.967
Oh.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.567
-Mmm!
-Mmm.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.667
Talk to me.

05:22.667 --> 05:25.767
Well, it's thorny.
So many old cases aggregated.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.500
Taken all together,
it looks like

05:27.500 --> 05:29.233
a pattern of overreach,
misconduct.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.734
That's why the papers think
it's such a good story.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.266
And there's
the Axelrod case.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.834
-We never even brought charges.
-That's good.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.767
You're protected
by qualified immunity.

05:37.767 --> 05:39.867
Chances are, we get it
thrown out of court.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.533
That will depend on the judge.
We gotta find a very --

05:42.533 --> 05:44.266
Chuck,
I'm gonna make this go away.

05:44.266 --> 05:46.333
That's why you came to me
instead of going

05:46.333 --> 05:48.300
with whatever lawyer
Justice gave you.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.133
Justice
isn't defending me.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.433
Whoa.

05:56.433 --> 05:59.133
They only do that
when, uh...

05:59.133 --> 06:00.800
Well,
they never really do that.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.100
No.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.200
Well,
I'm not billing you.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.600
Oh, come on.
You gotta bill me, Ira.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.133
It's $1,400 an hour.

06:08.133 --> 06:11.233
Half price.
Friends and family.

06:11.233 --> 06:12.734
Why aren't
they defending you?

06:14.133 --> 06:18.066
The Attorney General's
called me down to Washington.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.767
She's gonna fire me.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.967
Shit. Dake.

06:21.967 --> 06:24.567
Oh, it's a lot of things
over years.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.400
But the stain
of this investigation

06:26.400 --> 06:28.166
has hobbled me
politically.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.233
I got no back channel
out of this.

06:30.233 --> 06:33.300
You gotta prove your loyalty,
then, show her you're a soldier.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.834
Yeah.
I thought about that.

06:34.834 --> 06:37.633
A new case
the administration smiles on.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.500
Let the General
take the credit, sure,

06:39.500 --> 06:41.967
but there's just
no fucking time.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.033
The A.G.'s got
a lot of enemies, Chuck.

06:44.033 --> 06:47.033
Take out an enemy --
a big, hard-to-kill one.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.533
It's tough to fire you then.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.934
Finding the right target
might be enough.

06:51.934 --> 06:55.100
One so...gaudy,

06:55.100 --> 06:57.200
so outlandishly difficult
to bring down

06:57.200 --> 06:59.433
that my replacement
would certainly fail.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.066
How much time do you have?

07:03.066 --> 07:04.934
Three days.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.100
Do you know
what this is about?

07:20.400 --> 07:24.400
Starting immediately,
you have a new mandate.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.967
Find me a case
that's screaming for justice.

07:26.967 --> 07:29.800
One that no one else would have
the courage to take on --

07:29.800 --> 07:33.233
even if -- no, especially  if

07:33.233 --> 07:34.834
it seems impossible to win.

07:34.834 --> 07:35.967
Where do we begin?

07:35.967 --> 07:37.734
I want to kick
into the C-suites --

07:37.734 --> 07:39.233
those Teflon corporations

07:39.233 --> 07:42.166
that defraud the American people
on a grand scale.

07:42.166 --> 07:45.000
No one was ever prosecuted
for the financial crisis, no.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.300
When we went after Wall Street,
we got what we could get --

07:48.300 --> 07:49.934
rogue traders, chip shots.

07:49.934 --> 07:52.033
That ends today.

07:52.033 --> 07:54.767
Anything else you can say
that would narrow the target?

07:54.767 --> 07:56.834
You want us to get back up
on Axe Capital?

07:56.834 --> 07:59.266
-Um, we know that they're --
-No, no.

07:59.266 --> 08:01.867
Steer wide
around Axe Capital for now.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.433
That's not gonna help.

08:05.734 --> 08:08.700
Help what?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.100
Be creative.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.567
I look forward to your ideas,
and I want them in 24 hours.

08:19.233 --> 08:22.233
Why's he want
an impossible case?

08:22.233 --> 08:24.934
It's hinky.

08:24.934 --> 08:27.500
I'm gonna steer wide
around all of it.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.100
Hey, Axe,
you know what today is?

08:30.100 --> 08:32.667
It's fuck Todd Krakow
in the ear day.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.767
Why do you think
I'd want to do that?

08:34.767 --> 08:37.133
That panel was Godzilla
versus Mothra.

08:37.133 --> 08:38.800
Do you have a plan?

08:38.800 --> 08:41.400
Or are we just gonna jump him
and break his kneecaps

08:41.400 --> 08:43.066
when he gets out
of his McLaren?

08:43.066 --> 08:46.233
Okay, so Krakow's been running
his mouth about China, right?

08:46.233 --> 08:48.300
I...
You can tell the way he talks.

08:48.300 --> 08:51.600
-The way he talks?
-Yeah.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.600
Last year, he said,
"watching factories grow."

08:54.600 --> 08:56.700
It made me wonder,
"How's he seeing this?"

08:56.700 --> 08:59.700
Really, Mafee?
You expect me to believe

08:59.700 --> 09:01.467
you suddenly swapped
Ali G reruns

09:01.467 --> 09:04.200
for videos of Todd Krakow's
speeches on China?

09:04.200 --> 09:05.467
Okay.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.233
My analyst caught it.

09:07.233 --> 09:10.367
Yeah.
Then get him in here.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.867
Hello.
I'm Taylor.

09:18.867 --> 09:21.233
My pronouns are they,
theirs, and them.

09:21.233 --> 09:25.233
Okay.
You have two minutes.

09:25.233 --> 09:28.266
After your dispute with Krakow,
I presumed roiling antipathy,

09:28.266 --> 09:30.066
so I catalogued
all of his public statements

09:30.066 --> 09:31.667
going back two years.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.633
In January 2016, Krakow's
tone on China changed --

09:34.633 --> 09:36.667
more bullish, omniscient,

09:36.667 --> 09:39.767
which led me to think
satellite images.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.400
So what?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.667
All the big funds
are using satellite images.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.967
How many cars are in the parking
lot at Walmart

09:45.967 --> 09:48.400
indicates how big a quarter
they're gonna have.

09:53.734 --> 09:57.100
But this, let me see.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.600
You found out which
satellite company Krakow uses.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.934
AR Metrics.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.934
Assuming Krakow would be
the biggest user --

10:02.934 --> 10:04.533
Their most-viewed images,

10:04.533 --> 10:06.934
and you deduced that's what
he's been looking at.

10:06.934 --> 10:09.266
A microchip factory
in the Pearl River Delta.

10:09.266 --> 10:12.000
And now you know
what he knows.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.300
Since you're in my office,

10:13.300 --> 10:15.000
you think you know
what he doesn't.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.700
China's not just cooking
the books,

10:16.700 --> 10:18.867
they're going full
Iron Chef with that shit.

10:18.867 --> 10:21.433
Everyone knows that, Mafee.
Then why is Krakow long?

10:21.433 --> 10:24.266
Come on, time's almost up.
What happened in January 2016?

10:24.266 --> 10:26.433
The Chinese factory
went from totally dormant

10:26.433 --> 10:28.166
to bustling
with trucking activity.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.133
Which meant
foreign investment followed.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.800
But tell me
what really happened.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.000
An article came out
on satellite-detected

10:34.000 --> 10:35.700
discrepancies
between Chinese sites

10:35.700 --> 10:38.300
and what had been reported
by government statistics.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.734
And after that, they knew
they were being watched,

10:40.734 --> 10:43.633
so the trucks started moving --
a show for the satellites.

10:43.633 --> 10:46.633
Factory's a fake.
It's a shell to milk investors.

10:46.633 --> 10:48.734
And what is the next move?

10:48.734 --> 10:50.967
-Short the--
-I asked Taylor.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.467
Short the Chinese parent company
Krakow's invested in.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.867
It's not good enough.

10:54.867 --> 10:57.734
As Chanos says,
China's a pig on LSD --

10:57.734 --> 11:00.633
you never know
which way it's gonna run.

11:00.633 --> 11:04.333
So who is this fake factory
supposed to be supplying?

11:04.333 --> 11:06.400
What does this ripple out into?

11:06.400 --> 11:09.000
You find that, you find
Krakow's real investment.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.467
How long you been here?

11:12.467 --> 11:15.667
Three months.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.934
I'm leaving in two weeks
for grad school.

11:18.934 --> 11:20.133
I'm an intern.

11:26.533 --> 11:28.500
How did everything go?

11:32.433 --> 11:34.467
Salutations, my dear.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.767
Oh.
Um...

11:36.767 --> 11:38.800
I think Chuck's working
tonight.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.333
I wanted to talk to you.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.667
Pas devant.

11:44.734 --> 11:46.567
We'll see you
tomorrow.

11:48.467 --> 11:50.633
I know what
pas devant  means.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.500
I was looking for some
cufflinks I lent my son,

11:57.500 --> 11:59.967
but I couldn't find them
in the bedroom.

11:59.967 --> 12:02.233
You were in my bedroom?

12:02.233 --> 12:05.567
And most of Chuck's suits
seem to be gone from the closet.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.967
You didn't come out
to Brooklyn for cufflinks.

12:07.967 --> 12:10.600
Is Chuck living
at the Yale Club?

12:12.633 --> 12:14.800
Some gal in accounting
messed up,

12:14.800 --> 12:19.533
sent me a charge for a breakfast
on a day that I was not there.

12:19.533 --> 12:21.133
So I asked for the chits,

12:21.133 --> 12:24.433
and it was Chuck's signature
on the line at 6:30 a.m.

12:24.433 --> 12:28.100
Yes, we've separated...
for now.

12:28.100 --> 12:31.834
And you've kept it
from me.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.800
I asked Chuck directly,
but he denied it.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.934
He lies
better than I do.

12:38.433 --> 12:40.000
This is idiocy.

12:41.834 --> 12:44.266
And to think we didn't come
running to you with the news.

12:44.266 --> 12:45.934
Because I would tell you
the truth.

12:45.934 --> 12:48.467
This is selfish,

12:48.467 --> 12:50.033
destructive
to your children.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.467
We're not uprooting
the kids.

12:51.467 --> 12:52.967
They're staying
in the house.

12:52.967 --> 12:54.967
Chuck spends three nights
a week with them.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.533
No, I'm not talking
about that.

12:56.533 --> 12:58.133
I'm talking
about their legacy.

12:58.133 --> 13:01.333
Do you think that this makes it
easier or harder...

13:01.333 --> 13:03.667
for Kevin to meet
his station in life?

13:03.667 --> 13:06.967
You must mean
for him to be happier.

13:06.967 --> 13:09.066
They are the future
of my name.

13:09.066 --> 13:10.333
And yours.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.567
You think you and Chuck
are the only ones

13:12.567 --> 13:15.967
who've grappled with
some upheavals in a marriage?

13:15.967 --> 13:20.734
Unless it is broken plates
and steak knives,

13:20.734 --> 13:23.333
you gut through it.

13:23.333 --> 13:26.133
If one of you has an itch,
you'll work it out.

13:26.133 --> 13:27.367
You don't move out.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.767
It wasn't an itch.

13:30.433 --> 13:32.700
And what about you?

13:32.700 --> 13:35.533
You'd really rather have
your three nights a week

13:35.533 --> 13:39.100
than be First Lady
of the State of New York?

13:41.633 --> 13:44.600
Maybe I would.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.600
And if you want
to continue this,

13:46.600 --> 13:48.433
do it with your son.

13:50.467 --> 13:54.300
Oh...I will.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.834
Bobby.
Your order's there.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.200
White clam is on top.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.166
Thanks, Bruno.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.133
Say hello to my nephew,
Marco.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.467
Kid just got elected

14:04.467 --> 14:06.133
to county executive
up in Sandicot.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.300
I'm Marc. An honor to meet you,
Mr. Axelrod.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.667
Sit down,
have some wine.

14:11.066 --> 14:12.100
Is this yours?

14:12.100 --> 14:14.066
Made it
with my own two feet.

14:16.066 --> 14:17.266
Eh?

14:17.266 --> 14:19.233
Hey, look,
I'll stay next time.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.800
-Kids are hungry.
-Okay.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.266
Ciao, Bobby.
Enjoy.

14:22.266 --> 14:24.734
Good to meet you.

14:24.734 --> 14:27.000
That's a busy man.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.367
Yeah.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.367
There'll be time.
There'll be time.

14:34.333 --> 14:38.667
-You told my father.
-I didn't tell him.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.367
He's like you.
He figured it out.

14:40.367 --> 14:43.433
No, he had a theory,
which you confirmed.

14:43.433 --> 14:45.934
-He's hounding me now.
-What about these lawsuits?

14:45.934 --> 14:47.600
Were you gonna tell me
about them?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.767
Why did I have to read
about it in the Times?

14:49.767 --> 14:51.633
Nuisance suits.
Minor distraction.

14:51.633 --> 14:52.934
Didn't rate a discussion.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.600
This investigator --
Oliver Dake.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.200
Yeah, well,
I told you about him.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.600
He's questioning me later.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.734
Please, come in.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.967
So, Chuck...

15:11.967 --> 15:16.800
do you still feel as if
you're under attack...

15:16.800 --> 15:20.734
by unseen forces?

15:25.266 --> 15:28.467
Carolyn, can we have the room
for five minutes?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.467
Look, I don't know
what to say to him.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.467
He knows you dropped
the case.

15:37.467 --> 15:39.500
He thinks
it's connected to me.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.867
If he puts together
the session notes...

15:41.867 --> 15:43.967
That will be
a career-ender for me.

15:43.967 --> 15:46.667
I'm aware.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.200
You're the expert
on this sort of thing.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.600
How should I spin it,
what kind of...

15:53.600 --> 15:54.934
language should I use?

15:54.934 --> 15:56.834
Should I have
an attorney present?

15:56.834 --> 16:00.166
Mmm, no.
That will make it look worse.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.800
No, don't spin it at all.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.166
Answer his questions
truthfully,

16:09.166 --> 16:11.667
don't put any lies
on the record no matter what.

16:11.667 --> 16:15.133
I don't...

16:15.133 --> 16:18.567
I don't want you
to lie for me.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.133
Probably gonna go down anyway.

16:23.133 --> 16:25.066
I don't want you
going down with me.

16:25.066 --> 16:27.667
Kids are gonna need one parent
not in custody, right?

16:38.100 --> 16:40.734
We should probably
let her back in.

Your relationship
with your husband,

would you say
it's been healthy?

17:43.066 --> 17:45.166
We have our ups and downs.

17:45.166 --> 17:46.567
When did you stop
living together?

17:46.567 --> 17:48.166
Is that relevant?

17:48.166 --> 17:50.867
Was it before or after you
were given five million dollars

17:50.867 --> 17:52.600
by the target
of his investigation?

17:54.867 --> 17:57.166
We separated
right before that.

17:57.166 --> 18:00.233
I find the timing
convenient.

18:01.433 --> 18:03.533
Are you married,
Mr. Dake?

18:03.533 --> 18:06.233
My status is none
of your concern.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.233
So you are.

18:08.233 --> 18:09.867
But it's new -- two years?

18:11.100 --> 18:13.200
I hope you don't find this
out personally,

18:13.200 --> 18:14.900
but separating
is never convenient.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.800
If you are
legitimately separated --

18:16.800 --> 18:18.467
-That's been established.
-Has it?

18:18.467 --> 18:21.033
Or did the two of you
work in a separation

18:21.033 --> 18:23.166
to make Axelrod's payment
more palatable?

18:23.166 --> 18:24.734
They're not connected.

18:26.433 --> 18:27.934
How long after the payment

18:27.934 --> 18:29.834
did you end your employment
at Axe Capital?

18:29.834 --> 18:31.467
The same day.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.734
What an eventful day.

18:33.734 --> 18:36.900
How would Axelrod
characterize the payment?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.900
It was compensation.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.133
A bonus
for services rendered,

18:41.133 --> 18:43.900
a very complex session
for Axe himself.

18:43.900 --> 18:46.767
What did you talk about?

18:46.767 --> 18:49.333
I'm a medical doctor,

18:49.333 --> 18:51.900
and that's privileged
information, as you well know.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.233
So if you're trying
to trip me up, try harder.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.667
You can come back
with a court order, lock me up,

18:56.667 --> 18:58.033
and I'd still
never tell you

18:58.033 --> 18:59.834
a goddamn thing
about my patients.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.467
I just wonder what could have
been said in such a session

19:02.467 --> 19:04.066
to justify
such an enormous sum.

19:04.066 --> 19:06.734
It was commensurate with other
bonuses at Axe Capital.

19:06.734 --> 19:08.967
So five million dollars
is not a large bonus?

19:08.967 --> 19:11.967
What a rarified world
you live in, Ms. Rhoades.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.266
Did something else happen

19:13.266 --> 19:15.800
to increase your value
to Axelrod?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.433
Such as?

19:19.200 --> 19:23.200
Did you provide him
information?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.734
I'm not sure
what you mean.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.767
Details
about the investigation

19:26.767 --> 19:29.600
or its status,
past, present, or future?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.333
No, nothing.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.066
I see.

19:38.567 --> 19:41.100
Do you think
that your husband

19:41.100 --> 19:44.266
was really recused
from the Axelrod case,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.233
as he claimed?

19:46.233 --> 19:48.734
He told me he was.
I took it at face value.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.767
Did you ever hear him
discuss the case

19:50.767 --> 19:52.967
with colleagues
or on the phone?

19:52.967 --> 19:54.300
♪ dramatic music plays ♪

19:54.300 --> 19:57.500
I can't say for sure
that I did.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.100
But you can't say
you didn't.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.266
No, I can't.

20:06.033 --> 20:09.133
We're going to need
to talk formally again.

20:09.133 --> 20:11.433
Okay, I really don't have
anything more to say.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.133
You can confirm
that Chuck Rhoades

20:13.133 --> 20:15.667
was secretly directing
the Axelrod investigation.

20:15.667 --> 20:18.800
He wasn't really recused,
was he?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.633
Are we gonna do this
over the phone?

20:20.633 --> 20:22.600
No.
In your office.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.867
And you will give me
what I need.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.367
Or maybe we'll have
a pepperoni slice in Yonkers.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.300
You can invite your boss.

20:29.300 --> 20:33.433
I can influence the vector
of your future, Mr. Connerty.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.633
And you'd do well
not to forget that.

20:55.633 --> 20:57.066
I got more on Krakow.

20:57.066 --> 20:58.667
No. Get your

21:05.633 --> 21:07.233
I know it.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.934
It's a hedge fund group grope,
Krakow leading the party.

21:09.934 --> 21:12.333
Yes. Anata-Tek's IPO
two years ago was lukewarm,

21:12.333 --> 21:13.700
but the stock is soaring

21:13.700 --> 21:15.633
ahead of the release
of their flagship.

21:15.633 --> 21:18.266
-It's called the Ring.
-I know about the Ring, Mafee.

21:18.266 --> 21:19.600
It's a great prototype.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.600
But can they scale up,
can they ship product?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.433
Not if the microchips
are supplied

21:23.433 --> 21:25.333
by a fake Chinese factory.
Booyakasha!

21:25.333 --> 21:27.867
Short two million.

21:27.867 --> 21:30.934
Wake me up when the
stock's down ten percent
from the current levels.

21:30.934 --> 21:32.767
That's where we want to cover.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.800
This is gonna be fun.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.934
Okay.

21:37.934 --> 21:39.600

Fuck.
Who?

28:04.233 --> 28:05.433
No names yet.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.533
The claim is that
you were capricious,

28:07.533 --> 28:10.066
that, uh, you expected them
to use intimidation

28:10.066 --> 28:11.200
to get settlements.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.600
Oh, bullshit.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.367
Well,
this gives the case teeth.

28:14.367 --> 28:16.900
There's no way a judge
is gonna throw it out now.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.767
As your lawyer,
I gotta advise you

28:18.767 --> 28:20.700
to consider the idea
of a settlement.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.066
No.
I won't settle.

28:23.066 --> 28:24.734
Can't.

28:24.734 --> 28:27.066
No, any appearance of guilt
puts everything at risk.

28:27.066 --> 28:29.266
Every conviction
my office has ever made

28:29.266 --> 28:30.734

No.

28:30.734 --> 28:32.934
Well, you can't afford
to think in absolutes.

28:32.934 --> 28:35.066
I'm gonna fight this
all the way to a trial

28:35.066 --> 28:36.066
if it comes to it.

28:36.066 --> 28:37.667

cases, if you're found liable

28:40.633 --> 28:43.100
even for a portion of them,
it could bankrupt you.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.433
So if this gets sticky,

28:44.433 --> 28:47.600
how big is your trust,
how bulletproof is it?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.400
You might --
You might want to think

28:49.400 --> 28:51.000
about going offshore with it.
No.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.166

and I made a public vow.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.166

29:46.900 --> 29:49.467

is a client of mine.

29:49.467 --> 29:51.467

some gift cards.

29:54.066 --> 29:56.400

sell-off after hours.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.066
We covered.
Short it again.

29:58.066 --> 30:01.133
If it cracked this much from
just a tweet, they're terrified.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.600
We can break the rest of it
if we throw a rock.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
Okay.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.867

30:05.867 --> 30:07.900

30:40.066 --> 30:41.700
Is it coloring
your strategy?

30:41.700 --> 30:43.467
Perhaps
if you show restraint...

30:43.467 --> 30:45.467
Restraint?
Take a good look at the floor,

30:45.467 --> 30:48.633
because you don't know where the
fuck you're standing right now.

30:48.633 --> 30:50.734
-It's in my purview --
-You are here

30:50.734 --> 30:53.400
to keep the Visigoths
outside of the city walls,

30:53.400 --> 30:55.400
not to impugn judgment
of the Caesar.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.633
No, it's a smart question.

30:58.633 --> 31:00.867
Krakow knows
your personal animus.

31:00.867 --> 31:03.934
He could be counting on a
certain hasty economic response.

31:03.934 --> 31:05.066
It could be a trap.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.600
Inform Mafee.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.133
Hold on Anata-Tek until

31:28.266 --> 31:30.166
Never better.

31:30.166 --> 31:32.700
Good, 'cause there's
something I need you on.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.467
I need to diversify.

31:34.467 --> 31:37.467
I'm not talking

31:37.467 --> 31:40.433
I want to make a fundamental
change in our standing.

31:40.433 --> 31:43.300
We can't live inside
those city walls forever.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.967
Change is coming.

31:45.967 --> 31:47.834
Stay ahead of it.

31:47.834 --> 31:50.800
Start looking.

31:52.734 --> 31:57.300
I can't help feeling
these ideas are uninspired.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.967
What else do you have?

32:02.734 --> 32:05.400
We go after tech companies,
the media darlings,

32:05.400 --> 32:06.934
the "don't be evil" crowd.

32:06.934 --> 32:09.166
They're hypocrites,
dodging billions in taxes.

32:09.166 --> 32:12.233
No.
Think smarter, bigger.

32:12.233 --> 32:14.734
I need a narrative,
victims and villains.

32:14.734 --> 32:17.000
What if we went
after Spartan-Ives?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.767
That's as big as it gets.

32:18.767 --> 32:20.467
No, thank you.

32:20.467 --> 32:23.467
That place is a finishing school
for treasury secretaries.

32:23.467 --> 32:25.800
And we muck in there
and step wrong,

32:25.800 --> 32:29.600
we'll all be shaking cups
outside of the Bar Association.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.633
He's right. That's exactly
the opposite of what we need.

32:37.166 --> 32:40.767
Look, I get it.
I get it.

32:40.767 --> 32:44.867
We've all been bred
in a culture of perfection.

32:44.867 --> 32:47.000
Valedictorian, Phi Beta Kappa,

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
Head of Crim.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.166
You ever get a "B," Kate?

32:53.166 --> 32:56.500
Third grade, in Art.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.967
-I did extra credit, got it up.
-Yeah.

32:58.967 --> 33:03.133
Nobody wants to gamble on this,
get yoked to a loser.

33:03.133 --> 33:05.600
But you need to understand
it is not a gamble,

33:05.600 --> 33:08.166
it is a calculated risk.

33:08.166 --> 33:12.734
So go naked into the street

33:12.734 --> 33:17.100
and snare me a thundering,
monumental fucking case...

33:18.767 --> 33:21.266
...because none of you
are gonna get what you want

33:21.266 --> 33:24.000
until you cut yourselves open.

33:42.266 --> 33:45.333
What's going on, Bryan?

33:45.333 --> 33:48.166
I think we're doing our best
with what we've been given.

33:48.166 --> 33:51.200
Well, seems to me
you're a step slow.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.333
It's a big challenge,

33:53.333 --> 33:55.133
an expansion
of our moral mission.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.800
Normally,
I'd expect you'd tear

33:56.800 --> 33:58.533
into a piece of red meat
like that.

33:58.533 --> 33:59.800
It just takes time.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.800
I'll have something
by tomorrow.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.000
By end of day today.

34:09.233 --> 34:12.567
Right.
You're in D.C. tomorrow.

34:19.633 --> 34:21.233
Hey.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.767
If you don't want to work
together on this thing, great.

34:23.767 --> 34:26.066
Do not steamroll
my idea before I --

34:26.066 --> 34:28.166
That was me
doing you a favor.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.300
The Spartan idea
was a loser

34:36.300 --> 34:38.100
because of what Chuck's
not saying.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.700
I'm listening.

34:39.700 --> 34:43.300
Spartan-Ives is a friend
to the administration.

34:43.300 --> 34:47.166
Lawrence Boyd and the A.G. went
to fucking Horace Mann together.

34:47.166 --> 34:49.800
-So what Chuck's looking for --
-Is an enemy.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.300
He wants to bring him
a trophy.

34:51.300 --> 34:54.633
I've got one.

34:54.633 --> 34:57.700
Executive e-mails
leaked by a whistle-blower.

34:57.700 --> 35:00.400
This is the case
that he's looking for.

35:06.233 --> 35:08.600
Well, why don't you give it
to Chuck yourself?

35:10.066 --> 35:12.066
Might sound better
coming from you.

35:12.066 --> 35:14.400
Hmm.
Well, you really do think

35:14.400 --> 35:17.233
that finding the best case
would be a trap.

35:17.233 --> 35:19.567
But if you're wrong,
you don't want to risk

35:19.567 --> 35:21.934
Connerty bringing it in
and getting the credit.

35:21.934 --> 35:25.400
Maybe.

35:25.400 --> 35:29.133
But this could be
very good...for you.

35:29.133 --> 35:33.834
Or very bad.

35:33.834 --> 35:35.834
I don't care.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.266
I'll give it to Chuck
anyway

35:37.266 --> 35:39.100
because it's the right thing
to do.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.800
It's what Chuck wants.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.433
It doesn't make it right.

35:45.266 --> 35:50.266
♪ rock music plays ♪

35:52.266 --> 35:54.266
All right,
let's take a break.

35:55.967 --> 35:58.533
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said.

35:58.533 --> 36:01.033
About your next chapter.

36:01.033 --> 36:03.867
I think we should start
something -- a business.

36:03.867 --> 36:06.400
Interesting.

36:06.400 --> 36:07.767
What did you have in mind?

36:07.767 --> 36:09.500
I don't know.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.233
It should be unique, you know,
something that fits us.

36:15.633 --> 36:18.800
Nothing in the warehouse,
nothing in the truck.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.233
It's a quiet racket.

36:20.233 --> 36:22.300
I can get you more dirt
if you need it.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.734
Whole Chinese economy
works like this.

36:24.734 --> 36:26.667
So my guy likes
to get his beak wet --

36:26.667 --> 36:28.734
Let's stay on point.

36:28.734 --> 36:31.667
Anata-Tek is a company
with no tech.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.900
Just as Taylor
anticipated.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.400
She spotted that
from outer space?

36:36.400 --> 36:39.467
Not she. They.

36:45.533 --> 36:49.767
Get it hard,
keep it hard, use it!

36:52.300 --> 36:55.033
He hasn't fucked his woman
in six months.

36:55.033 --> 36:57.700
Should you...
be sharing that?

36:57.700 --> 36:59.367
Not in the "should" game.

36:59.367 --> 37:01.800
Welcome aboard, Gus.
Thanks.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.300
I know it was your plug
that got this done for me,

37:04.300 --> 37:06.467
and I have an elephant dick
of a memory.

37:06.467 --> 37:08.367
So when are you coming in
for a session?

37:08.367 --> 37:09.967
You want to go now?

37:09.967 --> 37:12.467
I'm not under the same mandate
as the other staff.

37:12.467 --> 37:14.900
You sure?

37:14.900 --> 37:16.900
Lot of changes around here.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.100
More out there.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.400
It'll hit ya.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.400
Guys like you and me,
we're getting older.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.900
We got to fight
for every scrap

37:22.900 --> 37:24.467
of what used to be ours
by right.

37:24.467 --> 37:27.633
No.

37:27.633 --> 37:29.133
Then let me buy you a steak.

37:29.133 --> 37:30.900
Not necessary.

37:34.633 --> 37:37.734
Omakase menu at Nakazowa.

37:40.233 --> 37:41.633
You are good.

37:41.633 --> 37:44.000
Have you talked
to the source of the e-mails?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.233
An hour ago.

37:45.233 --> 37:46.934
Said it's even worse
than what's there.

37:46.934 --> 37:48.934
CEO Kurt Williams
knew about it,

37:48.934 --> 37:51.600
could have stopped it,
directed it to continue.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.600
Well, that'll be
he said, she said.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.600
Now, this case is far
from showroom ready,

37:57.600 --> 37:58.934
but it's a real start.

37:58.934 --> 38:00.867
-Subpoena the company documents.
-Right away.

38:00.867 --> 38:03.734
Ace work.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.100
Mr. Rhoades, if you're looking
for a good whiskey bar

38:08.100 --> 38:09.900
near the A.G.'s office,
I got one.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.033
Opens early.
Not necessary.

38:12.033 --> 38:14.533
I just need you to loop me in
with the new deputy.

38:14.533 --> 38:16.567
I will happily connect you
to Fred Reyes.

38:16.567 --> 38:17.567
That would mean...

38:17.567 --> 38:18.900
That I have something

38:18.900 --> 38:20.433
the General would want
to hear about.

38:20.433 --> 38:22.100
...that my part in this is done.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.633
Don't worry.
Reyes knows who juiced him in.

38:25.633 --> 38:27.266
Adam.

38:27.266 --> 38:29.166
Fred, I got Chuck Rhoades
on the line.

38:29.166 --> 38:31.266
Chuck.

38:31.266 --> 38:34.066
Thanks for the good word.
I appreciate you putting me up.

38:34.066 --> 38:35.500
Well, I'm looking forward

38:35.500 --> 38:37.467
to a harmonious relationship
going forward.

38:37.467 --> 38:39.567
-Chuck, about tomorrow, it --
-No worries.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.066
I just want to make sure
that the A.G. knows

38:42.066 --> 38:46.066
that I'm preparing an action
against retail giant GoodStop.

38:46.066 --> 38:47.333
They've bilked employees

38:47.333 --> 38:48.934
out of millions
in unpaid overtime

38:48.934 --> 38:51.300
and engaged in a cover-up
at the highest level.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.567
-And you can prove that?
-Evidence in hand.

38:53.567 --> 38:55.000
It's early stages,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.867
but, uh, Kurt Williams
is swimming in a dirty pool.

38:57.867 --> 39:00.500
The same Kurt Williams
anonymously funding

39:00.500 --> 39:02.867
a super PAC
ripping her a new asshole?

39:02.867 --> 39:05.467
Well, that's an incredible
coincidence, Chuck.

39:05.467 --> 39:07.967
The A.G.'s wanted
to take them down for years.

39:07.967 --> 39:09.433
Let me sell her on it.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.900
I think she's gonna let you
bring it home.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.467
Much appreciated.

39:16.233 --> 39:18.133
Anata-Tek is bleeding out.

39:18.133 --> 39:21.367
Lost half its value.
Krakow fired the CEO.

39:21.367 --> 39:22.934
Do you want to make
a statement?

39:22.934 --> 39:25.367
No.
I've said enough.

39:25.367 --> 39:27.900
Congratulations
on rooting this out.

39:27.900 --> 39:30.233
A very good day for us.

39:30.233 --> 39:31.934
Thank you for backing
the idea.

39:31.934 --> 39:35.667
It really means a lot.
What do you care?

39:35.667 --> 39:37.734
I know you already
turned down a job here.

39:37.734 --> 39:39.500
There's nothing
on the line for you,

39:39.500 --> 39:40.834
so what do you care?

39:40.834 --> 39:43.266
I just like being right.

39:43.266 --> 39:45.000
No.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.767
There's something else.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.600

39:49.600 --> 39:53.100
You were testing me,

if I could see you,

40:00.400 --> 40:01.934

see what you saw.

40:01.934 --> 40:04.266

Don't settle for just one.

That's double entry level

40:17.500 --> 40:19.166
I'm getting my MBA
in Chicago

40:19.166 --> 40:21.100
under Eugene Fama,
the Nobel Laureate.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.467
Come on.
Fama's an egghead.

40:23.467 --> 40:26.800
Get an education right here.
Make it a million a year.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.633
What?

40:28.633 --> 40:32.266
Three seventy-five
or 750 or a million,
it's all the same to you?

40:32.266 --> 40:34.000
It's an abstraction?

40:35.834 --> 40:39.300
I don't know
if you can understand...

40:39.300 --> 40:41.000
maybe me being the way I am,

40:41.000 --> 40:45.567
but just breathing the air here
can be discomforting.

40:45.567 --> 40:48.800
The air is thinner.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.300
Nah.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.967
You don't belong here.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.500
You're outside it all.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.266
Sometimes you catch yourself
watching all the people

41:02.266 --> 41:04.100
like they're another
species.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.266
So you retreat...

41:06.266 --> 41:10.834
behind your aquarium walls,
watching.

41:10.834 --> 41:12.667
But you don't realize,
Taylor,

41:12.667 --> 41:17.433
that glass, it's not
a barrier, it's a lens.

41:17.433 --> 41:21.166
It's an asset.
It's what makes you good.

41:21.166 --> 41:24.133
You see things differently.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.166
That's an edge.

41:27.033 --> 41:28.600
What about
a week-to-week deal?

41:28.600 --> 41:30.133
Done.
We'll prorate the million.

41:30.133 --> 41:32.266
Nineteen thousand--

41:32.266 --> 41:34.100
Nineteen thousand,
two hundred and thirty
and seventy-seven cents..

41:34.100 --> 41:35.467
Hourly, $240.38.

41:35.467 --> 41:37.000
One hundred and fourteen
and forty-seven cents.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.166
Eighty hours a week?

41:38.166 --> 41:40.000
There's 168 hours
in a week.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.600
That's what you're paying for --
everything.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.300
Twenty-four seven.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.800
All right, Wags,
call me tomorrow,

41:48.800 --> 41:50.633
and I'll give you the rest.

41:52.133 --> 41:53.700
I think I just found the thing.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.900
-How do you feel about football?
-Which team?

41:55.900 --> 41:58.400
Not sure yet, but a franchise
is talking to bankers

41:58.400 --> 42:00.066
about putting itself
on the block.

42:00.066 --> 42:01.900
Good.
Go further.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.767
Nice.

42:07.233 --> 42:10.433
Axe?

42:10.433 --> 42:12.800
Can I help you, Todd?

42:12.800 --> 42:15.800
How many hours did you spend
obsessing over my positions?

42:15.800 --> 42:17.500
Ah, it paid for itself.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.333
Or, rather,
you paid for it.

42:19.333 --> 42:23.000
You got me, Axe.
You did.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.266
But don't worry.
I'll get you back.

42:28.633 --> 42:31.000
I'm not here for another
recruiting pitch.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.467
From the look in your eyes,
I'd say you have

42:33.467 --> 42:35.333
no real idea
why you're here.

42:35.333 --> 42:38.433
I just had to get out
of that office.

42:40.767 --> 42:45.266
Now it's come to this, the one
person I can turn to -- you.

42:45.266 --> 42:47.467
That's what the game
does to you.

42:50.133 --> 42:51.800
I'm glad you called.

43:01.333 --> 43:03.734
Nothing's straightforward
anymore.

43:03.734 --> 43:07.800
It's barely recognizable.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.166
When I was in your class
in law school,

43:10.166 --> 43:12.066
we didn't exactly cover...

43:12.066 --> 43:14.166
-The vagaries?
-Right.

43:14.166 --> 43:16.900
What was I going to say,
"When you leave these walls,

43:16.900 --> 43:18.934
none of what you do
will even resemble

43:20.800 --> 43:22.934

in the books"?

43:25.767 --> 43:29.934
When I look around the office,
I do not see friends.

43:31.600 --> 43:34.767
There was a-a woman...

43:34.767 --> 43:36.800
a colleague.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.867
Something good
was starting.

43:38.867 --> 43:42.767
But, uh, she saw me
for what I was,

43:42.767 --> 43:44.867
what I was becoming,
and then it was over.

43:44.867 --> 43:48.200
To think that real
relationships are possible

43:48.200 --> 43:49.367
in such a cauldron.

43:49.367 --> 43:51.433
I didn't count on that.

43:51.433 --> 43:53.367
But I guess

43:53.367 --> 43:57.066
I did count
on a shared mission.

43:57.066 --> 44:00.633
Yet you stay.
Yet you're loyal to Rhoades.

44:00.633 --> 44:02.834
I can't claim
the moral high ground anymore.

44:02.834 --> 44:04.633

44:04.633 --> 44:06.734
If I'm this conflicted
now...

44:06.734 --> 44:08.800
There's never been
a leader of any merit

44:08.800 --> 44:11.000
who was free
of those doubts.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.133
But you can't stop now.

44:14.133 --> 44:17.233
You need to feel what it will
be like to sit in that office,

44:17.233 --> 44:20.233
to be the one
making the decision.

44:20.233 --> 44:22.400
And to resolve
those conflicts --

44:22.400 --> 44:25.233
both the ones in the office
and inside yourself.

44:27.834 --> 44:31.266
Yeah, maybe I'll ride it out

You,
you are Mike Wagner.

46:35.767 --> 46:40.333
But you need to ask yourself
where are you at right now?

46:40.333 --> 46:42.633
What's churning
those waters up so much

46:42.633 --> 46:45.100
that a little cub like that
can break the levee?

46:56.333 --> 46:59.166
Things can't be that bad
for you here

47:08.100 --> 47:09.600
You thought you could
keep it from me.

47:10.600 --> 47:11.867
Nah.

47:11.867 --> 47:15.233
These things have a way of
floating up out of the murk.

47:18.400 --> 47:21.467
Our separation
is about needing space.

47:21.467 --> 47:24.734
And I think that extends
to you.

47:24.734 --> 47:26.133
So I have to ask you --

47:26.133 --> 47:29.433
I have something for you.

47:29.433 --> 47:31.734
It occurred to me
that your problem is money.

47:31.734 --> 47:33.233
-Always has been.
-I disagree.

47:33.233 --> 47:34.600
She has more money than you,

47:34.600 --> 47:36.900
and that's outside
the natural order of things.

47:36.900 --> 47:38.967
But it's only because
everything you have

47:38.967 --> 47:41.633
is bound up in this silly trust,
and you can't use it.

47:41.633 --> 47:43.900
You're effectively
a cripple.

47:43.900 --> 47:45.734
I'm rewarded
by a different metric.

47:45.734 --> 47:47.300
But I have a solution.

47:47.300 --> 47:50.867
A signature from me
as your trustee,

47:50.867 --> 47:53.467
and it goes where we need.

47:53.467 --> 47:55.433
You didn't.

47:58.133 --> 48:00.734
I bought a ring.

48:00.734 --> 48:02.300
We're in my office.

48:02.300 --> 48:04.867
It's not a gift from me.

48:04.867 --> 48:06.900
I bought it
with your money.

48:11.066 --> 48:13.533
Give it to Wendy.

48:13.533 --> 48:15.867
- Show her you're serious...

48:15.867 --> 48:18.033
-...about maintaining the union.
-No.

48:18.033 --> 48:20.734
No. That's not a move.
That's not who she is.

48:20.734 --> 48:23.800
It's a six-figure ring, son.
It's who they all are.

48:23.800 --> 48:26.300
What time does your thing start?

48:26.300 --> 48:28.300
-Stuckey Brown told me...
-Stuckey Brown.

48:28.300 --> 48:30.600
...he once had a woman
upstairs in his bed...

48:30.600 --> 48:32.233
Mm-hmm.

48:32.233 --> 48:34.400
...when he heard his wife
walk in the front hall.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.900
Uh, Dad, I need to, uh...

48:36.900 --> 48:40.266
So Stuckey called down to her,
he said, "Elizabeth,

48:40.266 --> 48:43.667
if you don't put
one foot on the stairs,

48:43.667 --> 48:45.567
I'll wire two million dollars
to your account."

48:45.567 --> 48:48.066
-Uh-huh.
-And what did she do?

48:48.066 --> 48:50.600
She walked right back
out the front door.

48:50.600 --> 48:52.266
Take the ring.

48:52.266 --> 48:54.433
It's a balm, it's a way --

48:58.166 --> 48:59.700
Thank you, Dad.

48:59.700 --> 49:02.900
I appreciate the gesture.
I do.

49:02.900 --> 49:04.867
But, uh...

49:04.867 --> 49:08.533
And I'm sorry that I kept
our situation from you.

49:08.533 --> 49:10.734
I know it hurt
your feelings.

49:10.734 --> 49:15.066
-No, I'm fine.
-But I cannot accept the ring.

49:15.066 --> 49:17.900
I cannot invade my trust
in any way,

49:17.900 --> 49:19.867
in this life or the next.

49:19.867 --> 49:23.700
It would be...unethical.

49:23.700 --> 49:25.300

to his car.

49:37.934 --> 49:40.000

the recital.

50:15.133 --> 50:17.500
It's been a balled-up
kind of a day.

50:17.500 --> 50:20.667

to me.

50:20.667 --> 50:22.667

to anything too damaging.

50:32.633 --> 50:34.934
But he'll be
on your recusal next,

50:34.934 --> 50:38.467
and...he is not
gonna stop.

they can't see it's a dumpster
burning in front of them.

their losses.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.467

can pivot,
