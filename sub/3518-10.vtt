01:58.970 --> 02:00.889
And where are you from,
Mr. Brown?

02:02.264 --> 02:04.976
Sheldon, sir.
I'm a retired police officer.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.269
Well, then I can only imagine
that Sheldon must be

02:07.353 --> 02:09.270
one of the safest places in this state.

02:09.354 --> 02:12.608
We do our best.

02:12.692 --> 02:16.487
But my son, he's a marine,
stationed at Camp Dwyer.

02:16.571 --> 02:19.074
He keeps our country safer than I do.

02:19.157 --> 02:20.533
Me and my wife were wondering,

02:20.616 --> 02:24.704
if he got sent over to the Jordan
Valley, will that really keep us safer?

02:24.787 --> 02:28.541
Because it sure seems like
the whole peacekeeping mission

02:28.624 --> 02:30.501
is only making things more dangerous.

02:31.669 --> 02:32.754
Thank you for that. May I?

02:34.964 --> 02:39.177
Well, first of all, let me say how
grateful I am for your son's service.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.804
I know we all feel exactly the same way.

02:47.393 --> 02:49.229
And now, uh, let me try
to answer your question.

02:49.311 --> 02:52.607
Have we run into some difficulties
with the Russians?

02:52.690 --> 02:54.358
Yes, we have.

02:54.442 --> 02:57.904
Is there tension between
the Israelis and the Palestinians?

02:57.987 --> 02:59.321
Absolutely.

02:59.405 --> 03:04.035
But, that is the very reason
that this mission is so important.

03:04.119 --> 03:08.539
We have gathered together
a coalition of seven nations

03:08.623 --> 03:11.251
to bring stability to a region

03:11.333 --> 03:14.921
that has suffered
from unrest for decades.

03:15.004 --> 03:17.006
It will take time.

03:17.090 --> 03:19.968
And there may be lives
that will be lost.

03:20.051 --> 03:23.512
But this is not just important
for the Middle East's security,

03:23.596 --> 03:27.767
it's important for the security of the
United States and the rest of the world.

03:27.850 --> 03:30.228
And I hope that I've
answered your question.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.688
Now, who was next?

03:32.772 --> 03:35.233
Uh, let's see here.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.652
Well, how about
this young woman right here?

03:37.735 --> 03:40.738
Now, I'll give you my microphone,
but only if you promise to give it back.

03:40.822 --> 03:42.531
He seemed to want to hang
onto it for a while.

03:43.825 --> 03:47.245
- There you are.
- Um, my name is Annie Wietz,

03:47.328 --> 03:51.124
and I'm also worried
about what the officer was just saying.

03:51.207 --> 03:54.127
- I want a safe world for my grandkids--
- Give me back the mic

03:54.210 --> 03:56.838
- and I'll answer your question.
- I haven't asked my question yet.

03:56.921 --> 03:58.422
Oh!

03:58.506 --> 04:00.341
Apologies. I'm ahead of myself.
Go ahead.

04:00.424 --> 04:04.512
The covert operation, the one
that caused the Israelis to invade.

04:04.595 --> 04:09.225
Was that us? Because that really
seemed to make a mess of everything.

04:09.309 --> 04:10.559
- May I?
- Please.

04:10.643 --> 04:12.270
Thank you. Now, Annie?

04:12.353 --> 04:13.521
- Is that your name, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

04:13.604 --> 04:16.107
Now, I have said this
on this matter before,

04:16.190 --> 04:18.985
and I know it may be frustrating,
but it is the truth.

04:19.067 --> 04:23.072
When it comes to covert operations
by any nation,

04:23.156 --> 04:27.451
or matters of intelligence,
for security purposes,

04:27.535 --> 04:29.370
including the security
of our own soldiers,

04:29.453 --> 04:32.123
I simply cannot comment on these issues.

04:32.207 --> 04:36.002
But, sir, I'm sorry, but what is
the point of having us ask questions

04:36.085 --> 04:39.797
- if you won't answer them?
- Well, she's got me there. Uh...

04:39.881 --> 04:42.050
I can answer any question but that one.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.969
In fact, I hope that we can
ask some questions

04:45.053 --> 04:48.181
about how we're gonna focus
on things right here at home.

04:48.264 --> 04:49.724
How about someone up there
in the cheap seats?

04:49.807 --> 04:51.184
Anyone have a question there?

04:53.353 --> 04:57.065
The situation in Jordan Valley,
it threatens to bleed across the border.

04:59.441 --> 05:02.444
We already have refugees
requesting to enter Jordan.

05:02.528 --> 05:04.488
Forgive me, Prince Ryad.
You may be dealing with

05:04.572 --> 05:07.158
a few hundred refugees,
but we are facing mortar attacks.

05:07.242 --> 05:09.244
Fourteen in the last two weeks.

05:09.327 --> 05:10.745
None of your people have died yet.

05:10.828 --> 05:13.331
The last one came
within 50 meters of a school.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.917
Your troops have killed over
a dozen Palestinians in house raids.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.794
- You expect us not to fight back?
- We need the violence to stop.

05:18.878 --> 05:22.757
If it continues, the peacekeeping
mission will fall apart.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.177
And it's our best hope
for long-term stability.

05:26.261 --> 05:29.680
Can you speak to Hamas and Hezbollah?
Get them to agree to a cease-fire?

05:29.764 --> 05:32.433
Israel has twice as many troops
in the region

05:32.516 --> 05:34.394
as before the peacekeeping
mission began.

05:37.730 --> 05:40.400
No, it is we who are defending ourselves.

05:40.482 --> 05:42.026
You agreed to remove
two thousand troops.

05:42.110 --> 05:45.613
If there's a cessation of mortar
attacks, and if the Russians leave.

05:45.696 --> 05:47.407
A one-third troop reduction.

05:47.489 --> 05:49.867
That should be enough
to convince your people, no?

05:49.951 --> 05:52.995
Once the troops leave,
I engage them, but not before.

05:53.079 --> 05:56.374
Show some goodwill.
You'll still have 4,000 troops there.

05:56.456 --> 05:59.210
Because we cannot accomplish anything

05:59.294 --> 06:02.046
unless we have proof
of de-escalation on both sides.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.881
What about Russia?

06:03.965 --> 06:06.134
That's a separate issue.
We will tackle that another time.

06:06.217 --> 06:08.928
Can you convey to Jerusalem
the importance of this troop reduction?

06:09.011 --> 06:10.763
Yes, but no promises.

06:15.184 --> 06:16.560
All right. Thank you, everyone.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.021
We'll meet again tomorrow morning.

06:19.105 --> 06:20.356
Thank you, madam.

06:23.567 --> 06:26.195
Eliana.

06:26.279 --> 06:28.614
We need to discuss the no-fly zone.

06:28.697 --> 06:32.201
It's only for the Russians,
not the peacekeepers.

06:32.285 --> 06:35.371
They can't stay
if they have nothing to eat.

06:35.455 --> 06:38.498
What are you going to do,
shoot down a supply plane?

06:38.582 --> 06:40.793
We hope they won't make us
face that choice.

06:40.876 --> 06:42.420
They'll ignore it.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.964
And you're just going
to antagonize Moscow.

06:45.047 --> 06:47.675
I'm sorry, but the no-fly zone
is above my pay grade.

06:47.758 --> 06:50.345
Perhaps your husband can talk
to the prime minister.

06:50.428 --> 06:52.096
When are we looking at?

06:52.180 --> 06:54.640
Could be tomorrow, could be a week.

06:54.723 --> 06:57.310
I'm not a part of those
conversations anymore.

06:57.393 --> 06:59.103
We could vet the questions.

06:59.187 --> 07:01.563
That doesn't work in Iowa.
It'll piss people off.

07:01.647 --> 07:03.232
Even if we did,
it wouldn't make a difference.

07:03.316 --> 07:06.486
The country is preoccupied with
the Jordan Valley. We're off message.

07:06.568 --> 07:10.198
In the meantime, we can put the town
halls on hold. Just do the stump.

07:10.281 --> 07:11.782
I think we should also
postpone the debate.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.826
Dunbar'll hit you hard for that.
Say you're dodging.

07:13.909 --> 07:15.411
Have Jackie request
the postponement.

07:15.495 --> 07:17.038
- What's her reason?
- I don't care.

07:17.121 --> 07:20.166
Just as long as it isn't coming from us.
Talk to her. Thank you, gentlemen.

07:20.249 --> 07:22.335
What's next?

07:22.418 --> 07:27.923
Uh, you're slated for fundraising calls
until 4:15, then a DOD briefing.

07:28.007 --> 07:31.093
Also, your friend
from The Sentinel called, Tim Corbet.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.263
Thank you.

07:49.111 --> 07:51.406
You know, I can fold my own clothes.

07:51.489 --> 07:53.324
Took me two seconds.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.706
You remember when we
shared a room my senior year?

08:00.789 --> 08:03.584
And if I left, like, one sock
on the floor, you'd freak?

08:05.086 --> 08:07.713
Yeah, I started doing that on purpose,
just to see you flip out.

08:07.796 --> 08:10.132
Yeah. I remember.

08:23.854 --> 08:25.356
Come on, leave it.
Be a rebel.

08:31.362 --> 08:33.364
Hey, sweetie.

08:34.990 --> 08:38.202
Well, tell her if it wiggles,
it means it's gonna fall out.

08:40.746 --> 08:43.499
Okay. Let me talk to her.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.546
Hi!

08:49.838 --> 08:52.883
Uh, now, listen to me. You--

08:52.967 --> 08:54.510
I know your mom
doesn't want you playing with it,

08:54.594 --> 08:56.304
so you have to do what she says.

08:57.638 --> 09:01.267
Well, because the tooth fairy
doesn't want fingerprints all over it.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.396
Okay, I'll do it,
but you have to promise me

09:05.480 --> 09:07.940
that you and your brother
will stop playing with your tooth.

09:09.733 --> 09:11.152
Okay, you ready?

09:11.235 --> 09:13.028
Are you super ready?

09:14.905 --> 09:17.575
Boogala, boogala, boogala,
boogala, boogala.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.121
Okay. Put your mom back on.

09:23.872 --> 09:25.749
How much of a postponement?

09:25.833 --> 09:27.793
Until we get this crisis resolved.

09:27.876 --> 09:29.504
Dunbar will see right through that.

09:29.587 --> 09:31.297
Not if it's coming from you.

09:31.380 --> 09:34.300
Say you want to focus on meeting people
face to face, not a televised debate.

09:34.383 --> 09:35.843
We'll back you up.

09:35.926 --> 09:37.678
All right, I'll talk to my staff.

09:37.761 --> 09:39.888
We'll draft some language
and I'll run it past you.

09:39.972 --> 09:41.974
Jackie?

09:43.643 --> 09:46.437
I want to talk to you about
what happened a couple weeks ago.

09:46.521 --> 09:49.106
- I crossed a line.
- Remy, you don't have to.

09:49.190 --> 09:51.233
I want to. I want to explain myself.

09:56.155 --> 09:59.074
I still have strong feelings,
I'm not gonna deny that.

10:01.202 --> 10:05.247
Maybe a different job...
a different time, different place.

10:05.331 --> 10:06.666
But, uh...

10:07.958 --> 10:09.377
Look...

10:11.295 --> 10:13.922
I've loved people before,
and I've learned to let 'em go.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.427
I'm not gonna put you
in that position again.

10:24.684 --> 10:27.061
It's been hard for me, too.

10:34.151 --> 10:35.736
Hm...

10:38.322 --> 10:40.324
You've got work.

10:51.293 --> 10:53.379
I'm glad you said something.

11:41.009 --> 11:42.886
Hello?

11:42.970 --> 11:45.180
Tim, it's Frank.

11:45.264 --> 11:47.224
I'm sorry it took me all day
to get back to you.

11:47.308 --> 11:50.227
Ah, no worries.
Your plate must be pretty full.

11:50.311 --> 11:52.354
Well, more than I'd like at the moment.

11:52.438 --> 11:53.648
Is this a bad time?

11:53.731 --> 11:57.735
I think I can spare a few minutes
for the President of the United States.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.570
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

11:59.654 --> 12:03.115
Good. Uh, last kid got off to college,

12:03.198 --> 12:06.535
so Beth and I are on our own.

12:06.619 --> 12:09.913
Finally. Yeah, the business is strong.

12:09.997 --> 12:13.375
I'm actually, uh, I'm thinking
of expanding to Glenwood Canyon.

12:13.459 --> 12:14.834
That's great.

12:14.918 --> 12:19.632
Listen, I called because that, uh...
that writer reached out to me.

12:19.715 --> 12:21.717
You know, the one doing your book.

12:21.801 --> 12:25.763
Said, uh, he wanted to talk
about The Sentinel.

12:25.845 --> 12:26.972
What'd you say?

12:27.055 --> 12:29.266
I said I was in a rush
and I'd call him back later.

12:29.350 --> 12:31.769
I didn't want to say more
without talking to you first.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.604
Well, he should've checked
with me beforehand.

12:33.688 --> 12:35.356
I don't want him harassing my friends.

12:35.439 --> 12:37.857
He wasn't harassing me at all.
He's a nice guy, actually.

12:37.941 --> 12:41.696
I mean, I'm happy to talk with him
if it'll help your book.

12:41.779 --> 12:43.364
Well, the book isn't really
about The Sentinel,

12:43.447 --> 12:46.408
so I don't know why he'd bother, but
I'll talk to him and I'll let you know.

12:46.492 --> 12:48.202
Whatever you need, Mr. President.

12:48.285 --> 12:49.995
Stop that.

12:50.078 --> 12:53.833
Hey, listen, uh, we run a half-price
special for Commanders-in-Chief.

12:53.915 --> 12:58.838
So, uh... if you're ever in Colorado
with some time on your hands...

12:58.920 --> 13:01.716
Well, I hope the same goes
for ex-presidents, too.

13:01.799 --> 13:05.010
Nope. Only sittin' ones.
So you better win that damn election.

13:05.093 --> 13:08.514
I'll do my best.
Nice talking to you, Tim.

13:08.597 --> 13:10.015
You too, Frank.

13:17.897 --> 13:21.736
I want to set aside time
for Tom Yates, in person. Tomorrow.

13:21.819 --> 13:23.278
Yes, sir.

13:47.302 --> 13:49.012
Yes.

14:23.756 --> 14:25.215
Francis?

14:25.299 --> 14:27.217
I just got off the phone with Cathy.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.261
The Israelis are
instituting the no-fly zone.

14:29.344 --> 14:31.847
I'm scheduled to have a call tomorrow
with the prime minister.

14:31.931 --> 14:33.515
They want to cancel the call.

14:33.599 --> 14:35.016
Let me see if I can get him
on the phone now.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.645
They just sent out a communiquÃ©
to all embassies.

14:48.823 --> 14:50.783
Good morning.

14:50.866 --> 14:52.827
As you--

14:56.121 --> 14:58.165
Excuse me.
It's been a long night.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.584
Thank you.

15:04.129 --> 15:07.048
Israel instituted a no-fly zone

15:07.132 --> 15:10.845
over the Jordan Valley,
6:00 a.m. today, Israeli time.

15:10.928 --> 15:12.680
And while I disagree with this action,

15:12.763 --> 15:17.351
I understand the reason behind it,
and we must stand with our ally.

15:17.434 --> 15:20.938
Our chief goal remains
de-escalation in the region.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.773
Ambassador Underwood
and the State Department

15:22.857 --> 15:26.318
are working with all interested
parties toward that end.

15:26.401 --> 15:30.531
Our utmost priority
is guaranteeing civilian safety.

15:30.614 --> 15:35.076
- And Israel has confirmed--
- When are you off to Des Moines?

15:35.160 --> 15:38.372
A couple of hours.
I have to make some donor calls first.

15:38.455 --> 15:40.332
You have surgery today?

15:40.415 --> 15:43.335
A double bypass.
Triple tomorrow.

15:43.418 --> 15:46.129
But nothing scheduled
for almost a week after,

15:46.213 --> 15:48.966
so maybe I can come out
to Iowa and we can--

15:49.049 --> 15:51.468
- Russian aircrafts that ignore this...
- What's going on?

15:51.552 --> 15:53.637
...could potentially be subject
to military action...

15:53.721 --> 15:56.056
This Jordan Valley thing's a mess.

15:56.139 --> 15:57.432
He's in big trouble.

15:57.516 --> 15:58.726
...any such actions...

15:58.809 --> 16:00.978
And then there's the whole
AmWorks thing.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.897
All the baggage from last year.

16:04.147 --> 16:07.401
- You having doubts?
- I don't know.

16:07.484 --> 16:09.194
Maybe.

16:10.445 --> 16:12.823
That sounds serious.

16:12.907 --> 16:17.077
If there was an ideal time
to walk away, now is it.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.788
Mm-hm. And then what?

16:21.415 --> 16:23.124
Focus on Congress.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.502
Yeah, but you want more than that.

16:25.586 --> 16:28.255
I could spend more time
with you and the kids.

16:29.548 --> 16:31.091
Well, I don't want a wife
who's miserable

16:31.174 --> 16:33.343
because she turned her back
on the White House.

16:37.305 --> 16:39.641
Look...

16:39.725 --> 16:43.311
The thing about surgery is,
once you're in, you're in.

16:43.395 --> 16:48.191
There's a beating heart in front of you.
Someone's life.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.693
There's no room for doubt.

16:49.777 --> 16:53.072
So, whatever goes wrong...

16:54.782 --> 16:57.451
say hemorrhage or a blood clot,
you deal with it.

16:57.534 --> 16:59.369
You don't get to walk away.

17:01.204 --> 17:04.458
But that's life or death.
This isn't.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.002
It is for you.

17:08.087 --> 17:11.131
...to maintain international peace
and security.

17:11.214 --> 17:16.762
The United States is committed
to defusing this situation.

17:16.845 --> 17:19.848
We are here for Israel,
we are here for Palestine,

17:19.932 --> 17:22.267
we are here for Russia.

17:22.349 --> 17:23.935
And we are here for--

17:25.228 --> 17:28.272
- Ready to go to your meeting?
- Yeah.

17:44.414 --> 17:45.833
Come on.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.419
I was thinking...

17:49.503 --> 17:53.966
you know how a while back, you mentioned
the kids coming out from Ohio?

17:54.049 --> 17:56.093
You want them to visit?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.095
Well, maybe you don't want them
to see me like this?

17:58.178 --> 18:01.181
- Doing my 60 days?
- You've been doing great.

18:01.264 --> 18:04.018
I'd be thrilled for them to come
out here and meet their uncle,

18:04.101 --> 18:05.602
if that's something you want to do.

18:05.686 --> 18:08.063
I could hit the couch for a few nights.

18:08.147 --> 18:10.024
You guys can have the bedroom.

18:10.107 --> 18:12.818
I'll call Sarah.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.906
I say to Israel,
keep your airspace.

18:17.990 --> 18:20.534
Keep your no-fly zone.

18:20.617 --> 18:23.912
I will be flying through it, nevertheless.

18:23.996 --> 18:27.791
Shoot me down, if you wish,
because nothing can stop me

18:27.875 --> 18:30.127
from standing side by side
with my countrymen.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.505
I will embrace the men
who serve this country,

18:33.588 --> 18:35.841
because I am Russian,

18:35.924 --> 18:39.427
and Russians... do not abandon their own.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.390
Russian TV.

18:43.473 --> 18:46.810
Forty-five minutes ago.
It could be hot air.

18:46.894 --> 18:48.896
Petrov wants the world to see this.

18:48.979 --> 18:50.355
He wouldn't put it out there
unless he meant it.

18:50.438 --> 18:52.399
Israel says they're prepared
to enforce the no-fly zone.

18:52.482 --> 18:54.526
They'll never shoot down
a head of state.

18:54.609 --> 18:56.570
Yeah, which means they'll
lose face and compensate

18:56.653 --> 18:58.488
by increasing their ground presence.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.075
I got Jerusalem to agree to a pullout.

19:01.158 --> 19:03.160
- Two thousand troops.
- Not if Petrov flies there.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.371
If we downplay Petrov's move
as political theatrics,

19:06.454 --> 19:09.290
I might be able to convince
the Israelis to follow through.

19:09.374 --> 19:12.169
No, we need to respond
to Russia directly,

19:12.252 --> 19:14.462
not waste our time with Israel.

19:14.546 --> 19:16.882
Israel is our ally.
We're far more likely

19:16.965 --> 19:19.009
to have a productive dialogue
with them than with Russia.

19:19.093 --> 19:20.427
What's our main objective here?

19:20.510 --> 19:23.471
To get Russian troops
out of the Jordan Valley.

19:23.555 --> 19:27.350
Let's stop poking around from the sides.
We need to tackle this head on.

19:37.652 --> 19:40.072
Open up a line of communication
with Moscow.

19:40.155 --> 19:42.407
Tell them I'm coming
to the Jordan Valley myself.

19:42.490 --> 19:43.658
Sir, I--

19:43.742 --> 19:45.786
I'm gonna meet with Petrov face to face,
on the ground.

19:45.869 --> 19:47.704
- Mr. President, the risk factors of--
- I'm well aware.

19:47.788 --> 19:50.165
I want to be notified the moment
that Petrov is on his way.

19:50.249 --> 19:52.000
You work with the CIA and DOD

19:52.084 --> 19:54.377
to figure out any logistics
and security you have to.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.671
Talk to Seth.
Let's start drafting our message.

19:56.755 --> 19:59.800
Cathy, I want to sit down with you and
Defense, and work out bargaining chips.

19:59.883 --> 20:01.509
Thank you all very much.

20:03.845 --> 20:05.555
I meant now.

20:12.146 --> 20:14.773
- I'm not to be disturbed.
- You have a meeting with Mr. Yates.

20:14.856 --> 20:16.650
Have him wait and tell him
it might be a while.

20:16.733 --> 20:18.110
Yes, sir.

20:24.866 --> 20:26.994
You're on
with Ambassador Moryakov.

20:27.077 --> 20:30.330
- Alexi?
- You're wasting your time, Claire.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.458
We can't let Petrov go.

20:33.541 --> 20:35.669
I'm powerless.

20:35.752 --> 20:38.463
Then tell me who we can speak to
who can influence him.

20:38.546 --> 20:41.967
His mind is made up.
No one would dare challenge him on this.

20:42.050 --> 20:44.594
All right, then I'll come to New York.
Let's meet with Caspi.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.596
We'll ease Jerusalem's fears together.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.099
I can't.
I'm on my way to Washington.

20:49.183 --> 20:51.977
- What for?
- The embassy sent for me.

20:52.060 --> 20:53.812
I'm being recalled.

20:53.895 --> 20:55.897
- Is it because...?
- I don't know.

20:55.981 --> 20:58.317
Alexi, if you need anything--

20:59.693 --> 21:02.403
The ambassador
has ended the call, Mrs. Underwood.

21:12.247 --> 21:13.957
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Hello.

21:16.918 --> 21:19.254
- Edward?
- Wait here a moment.

21:21.589 --> 21:23.550
Yes, ma'am?

21:23.633 --> 21:24.885
What's he doing here?

21:24.968 --> 21:27.846
The president wanted to meet with him.
He asked me to have him wait upstairs.

21:27.929 --> 21:29.597
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:33.476 --> 21:36.104
If he wants the same terms
as we had before,

21:36.188 --> 21:39.482
I'll smooth it over
with our NATO allies.

21:39.566 --> 21:43.070
It's tough to lose Poland,
but I think that we can compensate

21:43.153 --> 21:46.240
with anti-missile subs
on patrol here in the Finnish Sea.

21:46.323 --> 21:49.409
- Thank you.
- Francis? Do you have a moment?

21:49.492 --> 21:51.203
I'll be right back.

21:53.454 --> 21:55.040
Give us a minute.

21:56.624 --> 21:59.169
I think this is a mistake.
You're chasing him.

21:59.253 --> 22:02.214
- Let me work with Israel.
- You've been working with Israel.

22:02.297 --> 22:04.632
Now there's a no-fly zone.
One step forward, two steps back.

22:04.716 --> 22:06.260
Diplomacy takes time.

22:06.343 --> 22:07.928
Iowa is in two months.

22:08.011 --> 22:10.597
You can't let the campaign drive
our foreign policy.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.850
If I don't win in Iowa,
there is no foreign policy.

22:13.934 --> 22:16.228
Excuse us, Mr. President.

22:16.311 --> 22:18.313
Let's not talk out here.

22:18.397 --> 22:21.275
If you go to the Jordan Valley,
you have to walk away with a solution.

22:21.358 --> 22:24.069
And he knows that,
which means he gets all the leverage.

22:24.152 --> 22:27.446
Well, it's not as if we have much
leverage at the moment.

22:27.530 --> 22:29.824
He's going to want
the peacekeeping mission out.

22:29.908 --> 22:32.411
That's right.
And the missile defense system, too.

22:32.493 --> 22:35.205
And I'm prepared
to give him both if necessary.

22:35.289 --> 22:38.417
What are you talking about?
Don't toss the mission aside, Francis.

22:38.499 --> 22:41.253
Claire, you're too invested in this.

22:41.336 --> 22:42.921
The mission is dead.

22:43.004 --> 22:46.258
It was dead the moment
those troops got blown up.

22:46.341 --> 22:49.677
Your plan failed. I'm sorry.

22:49.761 --> 22:51.554
It's my fault. I approved it.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.681
But now, I have to fix it.

22:53.765 --> 22:56.726
Why won't you place faith
in a diplomatic solution?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.353
This is diplomacy.

22:58.437 --> 23:01.315
Sometimes it comes down
to two men in a room.

23:01.398 --> 23:04.067
I have no faith in the UN anymore.

23:04.151 --> 23:07.946
I do have faith in my ability
to negotiate with this man.

23:08.029 --> 23:10.031
Francis, I know you value my opinion.

23:10.115 --> 23:12.033
Absolutely, above all others.

23:12.117 --> 23:15.578
We have both put a great deal of effort
and thought into how to handle Russia.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.956
I'd like for this to be a decision
we make together,

23:18.039 --> 23:20.750
instead of an impulsive response--

23:20.834 --> 23:22.836
- Not right now.
- Petrov's in the air.

23:25.255 --> 23:26.881
Get Admiral Dale on the line.

23:26.965 --> 23:31.386
Claire, I value your opinion.
I just don't agree with it this time.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.151
Mr. Yates.

23:46.234 --> 23:48.362
The president's
gonna have to reschedule.

24:00.415 --> 24:01.875
Thomas.

24:01.958 --> 24:04.002
You give us a few moments, Edward?

24:04.127 --> 24:06.254
Yes, ma'am. I'll be by the stairs.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.219
How's the book coming?

24:17.432 --> 24:20.060
I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

24:20.143 --> 24:21.853
There's a big piece missing.

24:21.936 --> 24:24.439
- What is it?
- You.

24:26.483 --> 24:29.110
He hasn't... mentioned me at all?

24:30.487 --> 24:32.947
Plenty of times, but...
it's not enough.

24:33.031 --> 24:35.242
What has he said?

24:35.325 --> 24:38.828
You're putting me in an awkward
position, Mrs. Underwood.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.830
You don't want to betray his trust.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.999
He and I have an agreement.

24:43.083 --> 24:47.045
I understand. I shouldn't pry.
I'll leave you be, then.

24:47.128 --> 24:49.839
He said he loves you more than anything.

24:51.425 --> 24:53.427
That there wouldn't be
a White House without you.

24:54.969 --> 24:58.181
He showed me your first house...
in Gaffney.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.310
Where you planted the tulips.

25:02.394 --> 25:04.187
And he said he was ashamed.

25:04.271 --> 25:06.189
Of what?

25:06.273 --> 25:09.025
That you married him.
Because you deserve better.

25:10.860 --> 25:13.488
You should really be in this book,
Mrs. Underwood.

25:13.572 --> 25:15.449
I've got a lot of stories
from his perspective.

25:15.532 --> 25:17.158
Not a single one from yours.

25:17.242 --> 25:20.328
Well, he's the one running
for president, not me.

25:20.412 --> 25:22.122
Yeah.

25:22.205 --> 25:23.790
I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

25:23.873 --> 25:27.626
I think people need
to hear your voice to hear his.

25:27.710 --> 25:29.379
Can we set up a time to meet?

25:30.547 --> 25:33.883
Um... I'll think about it.
Thank you, Thomas.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.552
Mm-hm.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.144
Okay.

25:45.312 --> 25:48.064
Seth, this is good,
but downplay expectations even more.

25:48.148 --> 25:49.857
There's no telling
what we'll walk away with.

25:49.941 --> 25:51.526
- Yes, sir.
- We shouldn't inform the press

25:51.610 --> 25:53.612
until after you land,
for security purposes.

25:53.694 --> 25:55.113
Donald...

25:56.281 --> 25:58.699
- If anything should happen to me--
- I'm prepared.

25:58.783 --> 26:01.536
- But nothing will.
- God help us.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.662
Danton will walk you
through the full brief.

26:03.746 --> 26:05.706
Everything's set up in the Situation Room.

26:05.790 --> 26:07.666
- Good luck, Mr. President.
- Thank you. I'll be right back.

26:12.547 --> 26:17.051
Now, listen, I know you have
reservations about all this.

26:17.135 --> 26:19.887
You're doing what you think is best.

26:19.971 --> 26:21.515
Please be careful out there.

26:21.598 --> 26:22.681
I will.

26:22.765 --> 26:24.851
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

26:29.230 --> 26:30.649
Let's go.

26:37.905 --> 26:39.824
Hello?

26:39.907 --> 26:41.909
- Hi!
- Hi.

26:41.993 --> 26:45.497
Hello! Wow! You guys really look alike!

26:45.580 --> 26:47.874
- Okay.
- Oh...

26:49.376 --> 26:50.877
We're a hugging family.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.671
I see.

26:52.753 --> 26:54.964
Hi, you must be Francine.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.884
- No, I'm not!
- She likes Franke better.

26:57.967 --> 27:00.094
Oh. Nice to meet you, Franke.

27:00.178 --> 27:01.429
- No.
- Yep.

27:01.513 --> 27:03.722
- I told you!
- Careful.

27:03.806 --> 27:06.393
It's your Uncle Doug.

27:06.476 --> 27:07.894
Do you want to give
your Uncle Doug a hug?

27:07.977 --> 27:09.770
Come here, you.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.651
We'll land in Tel Aviv,

27:14.733 --> 27:18.405
then take a special forces convoy from
there to the perimeter of the valley.

27:18.488 --> 27:21.199
The Israelis will provide air support
until we get to the valley,

27:21.282 --> 27:22.950
then our helos will take over.

27:23.034 --> 27:26.496
Once we get to the camp,
the Russians insist on ground units only.

27:26.580 --> 27:29.249
- We'll pass through a checkpoint--
- How secure is this location?

27:29.332 --> 27:31.585
The position is not fortified
to our liking.

27:31.668 --> 27:33.169
It's not blast-proof.

27:33.253 --> 27:36.923
Sir, we're going to ask that
you wear your Kevlar and helmet.

27:37.006 --> 27:40.343
- Sir?
- Mary.

27:40.427 --> 27:43.513
- Why were no press allowed to go?
- Given the security situation,

27:43.597 --> 27:45.390
we didn't want to put any press
in harm's way,

27:45.473 --> 27:48.602
or risk any hostile elements
knowing in advance.

27:48.685 --> 27:50.311
So the president has already landed?

27:50.395 --> 27:52.689
About 90 minutes ago.

27:52.771 --> 27:53.898
Mark.

27:53.981 --> 27:56.443
What exactly does the president
hope to achieve?

27:56.526 --> 27:59.446
Ideally, we'd like the Russians
to vacate the region.

27:59.529 --> 28:01.072
We can't promise that they will.

28:01.155 --> 28:04.701
But the president hopes that we can
make progress toward a withdrawal.

28:04.783 --> 28:05.952
Kate.

28:06.035 --> 28:07.662
This could be seen as an election stunt.

28:07.746 --> 28:10.164
He's trailing Dunbar in the polls,
so he wants to save the day.

28:10.248 --> 28:11.750
I guarantee you this is no stunt.

28:11.832 --> 28:14.793
The president is taking extraordinary
measures to end this crisis.

29:26.366 --> 29:28.326
Mr. President.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.794
You can take your vest off now,
Mr. President.

29:37.877 --> 29:41.047
- We're safe here.
- You trust these walls?

29:41.130 --> 29:43.007
If you're frightened,
you shouldn't have come.

29:44.676 --> 29:48.638
When I was in the KGB,
I spent six months in Afghanistan.

29:48.722 --> 29:52.225
This place is a palace compared
to the hole in the ground I lived in.

29:54.853 --> 29:57.856
Here. You should stay hydrated.

29:57.938 --> 29:59.899
I brought a shipment of water

29:59.982 --> 30:00.983
- in on my plane.
- Thank you.

30:01.067 --> 30:04.237
So much for the Israelis
stopping our resupply.

30:06.322 --> 30:09.367
I wish we were in the fertile part
of the valley, though.

30:09.450 --> 30:11.703
I hear it's quite green and beautiful.

30:11.786 --> 30:14.080
Well, this is better for pictures.

30:14.163 --> 30:15.248
How do you mean?

30:15.331 --> 30:19.293
Well, if you flew into a paradise,
wouldn't be as effective, now, would it?

30:19.377 --> 30:21.546
You do have a flair for the theatrical.

30:21.629 --> 30:25.633
I can say the same about you,
showing up on my doorstep like this.

30:25.717 --> 30:29.136
This isn't your doorstep.
You're squatting where you shouldn't be.

30:29.220 --> 30:32.014
I don't think my men
will see it like that.

30:32.098 --> 30:35.685
Do your men know that you're
responsible for killing their comrades?

30:35.769 --> 30:38.145
Accusations.

30:38.229 --> 30:40.899
That's how you plan to convince me?

30:42.817 --> 30:46.237
What do you require
to pull out of the valley?

30:46.320 --> 30:50.617
That your troops leave as well,
and the entire peacekeeping operation.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.869
Well, as soon as your troops withdraw,

30:52.952 --> 30:55.538
I'll make sure the UN
forces do exactly the same.

30:55.622 --> 30:59.250
Hm. And you scale back missile defense.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.836
As we agreed to twice already.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.505
That's when we were making
an entirely different deal.

31:04.589 --> 31:08.802
The main difference now is that
we're both standing in the desert,

31:08.885 --> 31:13.180
and you can't leave with nothing
to show but sand in your shoes.

31:13.264 --> 31:15.600
I'll agree to the scale-back.
Same terms as before.

31:15.683 --> 31:18.102
How soon can you mobilize a withdrawal?

31:18.185 --> 31:21.355
Well, the moment UN forces begin
to pull out, we will do the same.

31:21.439 --> 31:24.734
I've had the Pentagon come up with
an exit plan that we can put into effect

31:24.818 --> 31:27.069
as early as tomorrow.
As for the rest of the UN forces,

31:27.153 --> 31:29.989
I can reach out to
the Secretary General immediately.

31:30.072 --> 31:33.493
You or... your wife?

31:33.576 --> 31:35.703
Well, yes, she would probably
make the call on my behalf.

31:35.787 --> 31:37.580
I don't think she should.

31:37.664 --> 31:39.415
You think I should make the call?

31:39.499 --> 31:41.041
More than that.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.461
I think she should be gone.

31:44.796 --> 31:47.799
Gone in what way?
Gone from these negotiations?

31:47.882 --> 31:50.134
As ambassador.

31:50.217 --> 31:51.970
My final condition.

31:56.182 --> 31:57.809
That cannot be on the table.

31:57.892 --> 32:01.646
It is. And it's non-negotiable.

32:07.986 --> 32:10.279
Ms. Dempsey.
I'm a friend of Lisa's.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.699
- Uh, Max?
- That's right.

32:12.782 --> 32:15.451
Yes, she told me to tell you
she's running a few minutes behind.

32:15.535 --> 32:17.077
Okay, I'll just wait outside.
Thank you.

32:17.161 --> 32:18.621
No, it's... chilly.

32:18.705 --> 32:20.540
You can come on up to her room.

32:20.623 --> 32:23.417
Okay.

32:23.501 --> 32:26.337
I just want you to know...
I'm so sorry.

32:27.714 --> 32:30.216
Lisa told us and our prayers
are with you.

32:32.927 --> 32:34.721
Thank you so much.

32:36.055 --> 32:39.141
She said you and your husband
were like parents to her. I see why.

32:39.225 --> 32:41.519
Come on in.

32:44.814 --> 32:47.608
Max, hey.

32:47.692 --> 32:49.109
Sorry I'm late.

32:49.193 --> 32:50.945
Here, I want you to take that back.

32:51.029 --> 32:52.530
No, no, no, that money's yours.

32:52.613 --> 32:54.032
No, I can't. I can't take it.

32:54.114 --> 32:55.867
Everyone at the fellowship pitched in.

32:55.950 --> 32:58.369
- Just give it back to 'em.
- I can't.

32:58.452 --> 33:01.205
You said that you needed the money
for the medicine.

33:04.124 --> 33:05.543
Yeah, sit down.

33:06.627 --> 33:08.128
Sorry, please.

33:10.464 --> 33:11.632
Okay.

33:21.350 --> 33:23.227
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound fucked up,

33:23.310 --> 33:26.940
but just hear me out
before you say anything, all right?

33:28.608 --> 33:29.984
Okay.

33:32.779 --> 33:35.031
I'm leaving.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.324
And I'm not coming back.

33:37.408 --> 33:41.120
And... I have to leave
because I'm in danger.

33:43.581 --> 33:45.666
My name isn't Max.

33:46.751 --> 33:48.461
I don't have AIDS.

33:48.544 --> 33:51.047
- Wait. Hold on.
- Let me finish, please.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.050
I want to explain everything to you,
but I can't.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.843
The less you know, the better.

33:55.927 --> 33:57.637
But listen to me.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.848
If the FBI comes here,
you can't say anything.

34:00.932 --> 34:02.642
You have to tell them you don't know me.

34:02.725 --> 34:04.477
- The FBI?
- Yes, and if they do,

34:04.560 --> 34:07.647
I want you to contact this man.
His name is Doug Stamper.

34:07.730 --> 34:11.317
- And he can help you.
- Max. This is crazy.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.610
It's not my name.

34:13.694 --> 34:15.737
I made it up.
I made up everything.

34:15.822 --> 34:17.531
The name, the girlfriend, the clinic.

34:17.614 --> 34:19.158
No, I was there with you.

34:19.241 --> 34:21.577
I faked it. I had to.

34:26.623 --> 34:31.004
If you're not Max... then who are you?

34:35.757 --> 34:38.594
Take this. He will help you.

34:38.678 --> 34:40.679
- Oh...
- He can protect you.

34:40.763 --> 34:44.475
Please. I know it's not fair.

34:44.558 --> 34:46.018
- Please leave.
- Let me leave this with you.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.520
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

34:47.603 --> 34:49.605
Please, just take it with you.

34:49.688 --> 34:53.192
Please leave.

34:53.275 --> 34:55.152
You're a good person, Lisa.

34:56.402 --> 34:58.031
I'm just not.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.283
And I'm sorry.

35:12.252 --> 35:14.088
What can I offer you instead of her?

35:14.172 --> 35:16.090
Nothing.

35:16.174 --> 35:20.553
What about a humanitarian relief fund,
for your allies in Africa?

35:20.636 --> 35:22.972
You can distribute it
any way you see fit.

35:23.056 --> 35:25.141
A few billion dollars?
I'm not that easily bought.

35:25.224 --> 35:28.895
All right, let's say that we
re-examine our base in Izmir.

35:28.978 --> 35:30.396
Congress would never let you.

35:30.479 --> 35:34.608
And realistically, you're willing
to barter major strategic airfields

35:34.692 --> 35:36.276
on account of your wife?

35:36.360 --> 35:38.529
You can't make this about her.

35:38.612 --> 35:40.698
She was never equipped
to be an ambassador.

35:40.781 --> 35:43.242
You know that.

35:43.325 --> 35:45.161
I understand.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.581
How could you say no to your own wife?

35:48.664 --> 35:50.374
But she's blinding you.

35:50.457 --> 35:53.460
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You are being petty.

35:56.130 --> 35:58.257
The SEAL team you sent.

35:58.340 --> 36:01.052
Look how easily we manipulated her.

36:02.887 --> 36:05.514
Moryakov didn't have to work too hard.

36:07.307 --> 36:09.643
Did we blow up our own men?

36:09.727 --> 36:11.520
Maybe we did.

36:13.064 --> 36:15.482
Maybe we didn't.

36:15.566 --> 36:17.902
But we made her believe that we did.

36:17.985 --> 36:19.486
And she convinced you.

36:19.570 --> 36:22.907
Now, wouldn't you call that blindness?

36:27.870 --> 36:31.624
You want to kill me now. I can see it.

36:36.629 --> 36:39.006
I read an amusing article about, um...

36:40.758 --> 36:43.677
a Civil War re-enactor,

36:43.761 --> 36:47.181
who said that your
great-great-grandfather

36:47.265 --> 36:50.101
killed a Yankee soldier
with his bare hands.

36:51.811 --> 36:57.316
When I was in Afghanistan,
we were ambushed by the Mujahideen.

36:57.399 --> 37:01.195
And the man who shot me here and here,

37:01.279 --> 37:04.240
he stabbed me when his rifle jammed.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.742
I pulled the knife away
and slit his throat.

37:06.826 --> 37:09.120
Yes, I know, you've told that story
dozens of times to the press.

37:09.203 --> 37:13.499
The part I don't tell is that after
I slit his throat, I kept going.

37:15.668 --> 37:19.880
We strapped his head to a donkey so
it would carry it back to his village.

37:21.674 --> 37:24.051
I've killed a man with my bare hands.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.639
It wasn't make-believe.

37:31.142 --> 37:33.227
Do you think you're capable?

37:41.235 --> 37:43.112
I think you are.

37:46.324 --> 37:47.825
You're ruthless.

37:50.328 --> 37:51.745
Like me.

37:54.707 --> 37:58.544
Sometimes we must be ruthless
with those who hate us.

38:00.420 --> 38:03.674
And sometimes we must be ruthless
with those we love.

38:07.636 --> 38:11.224
I don't see why Claire
means so much to you.

38:12.141 --> 38:14.727
Because she means so much to you.

38:18.064 --> 38:21.942
And if you do this,
I will know you're serious.

38:43.881 --> 38:45.674
Your wife is on the line, sir.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.093
Tell her I'll call her back.

38:47.176 --> 38:48.386
I've told her that twice now.

38:48.468 --> 38:50.512
- Tell her again.
- Yes, sir.

38:56.727 --> 38:59.272
- You don't have to do that, Sarah.
- I don't mind. It doesn't take long.

38:59.355 --> 39:01.107
No, no. Let us do it.
You go relax.

39:01.190 --> 39:03.192
I'll move the monsters in a few minutes.

39:03.276 --> 39:04.818
- Okay.
- All right.

39:06.570 --> 39:08.822
See you in bed.

39:08.906 --> 39:10.241
See you tomorrow.

39:25.589 --> 39:27.674
I wish I could sleep like that.

39:30.677 --> 39:32.471
You ever think of settling down?

39:32.554 --> 39:35.224
Gettin' a couple of these for yourself?

39:35.308 --> 39:36.850
Hasn't ever crossed my mind.

39:38.060 --> 39:39.437
Never?

39:39.519 --> 39:41.772
It's not for me. A life like that.

39:43.565 --> 39:45.359
You mean a life like mine?

39:45.443 --> 39:48.446
- That's not what I said.
- I know you've always felt that way.

39:50.489 --> 39:54.160
A mortgage, nine to five,
wife, two kids, a dog.

39:54.243 --> 39:55.577
No.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.413
It's just my freedom's important to me.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.333
I'm freer than you are, pal.

40:02.376 --> 40:06.546
I stayed in Columbus because I liked it,
not because anybody made me.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.215
I chose to put down roots.

40:08.299 --> 40:09.883
You've always been running
from something.

40:09.967 --> 40:11.969
Hey, I don't judge you.
Don't judge me.

40:12.052 --> 40:13.553
Listen to your big brother
for a second.

40:13.637 --> 40:15.264
No, last thing I need
is a lecture right now.

40:18.225 --> 40:21.645
During your whole recovery, all you kept
talking about was getting back to work.

40:21.728 --> 40:23.481
Over a month I've been here,

40:23.563 --> 40:25.691
using all my vacation time
and then some.

40:25.774 --> 40:28.361
If you don't want to be here,
then maybe you should go home.

40:28.444 --> 40:30.904
It's not about that, Doug.

40:30.988 --> 40:33.782
I'm here because you're family.

40:33.866 --> 40:36.369
Because you're more important than work.

40:37.619 --> 40:42.166
Hey... If I lost my job because of you,
I'd find another one.

40:42.249 --> 40:44.126
What do you have?

40:44.210 --> 40:47.296
Frank Underwood?
You don't even have that.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.510
You got two pictures
on your fridge,

40:52.592 --> 40:54.928
and they're of my kids.

40:55.012 --> 40:56.514
That's not freedom.

41:18.952 --> 41:22.373
Petrov wants a diplomatic change.

41:22.456 --> 41:24.500
At the UN.

41:25.709 --> 41:28.921
- Me.
- It was non-negotiable.

41:33.842 --> 41:35.635
Clearly, you didn't say no.

41:36.636 --> 41:39.098
I wanted to discuss it with you first.

41:43.143 --> 41:44.853
I called more than once.

41:46.980 --> 41:51.569
I wanted to convince myself
to refuse what he asked.

41:51.651 --> 41:53.571
But... I couldn't do that.

41:53.653 --> 41:56.365
I told you it was
a mistake to go, Francis.

41:56.449 --> 41:59.243
And the resolution was a mistake.
And Corrigan was a mistake.

41:59.326 --> 42:02.580
We could tally up all our mistakes,
but we are where we are.

42:02.662 --> 42:06.166
I need to concentrate
on what's in front of me right now.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.586
I am. I'm in front of you.

42:12.089 --> 42:15.259
The Russians need to leave.
It's as simple as that.

42:15.342 --> 42:17.636
You want me to say this is okay.

42:17.719 --> 42:19.012
No.

42:19.096 --> 42:22.308
Francis, I would've preferred if you had
walked in and just told me I was fired.

42:22.391 --> 42:25.519
They played you, Claire.

42:25.603 --> 42:28.730
Moryakov was not having
some crisis of conscience.

42:28.814 --> 42:32.692
It was all so that we would
send our SEAL team in.

42:32.776 --> 42:35.279
So that we would provoke the Israelis.

42:35.362 --> 42:39.116
And I didn't see it,
because I trusted you too much.

42:39.199 --> 42:41.660
I didn't look at it objectively...

42:43.203 --> 42:45.080
because you're my wife.

42:47.166 --> 42:49.668
- Petrov told you that?
- Yes.

42:49.751 --> 42:52.630
- And you believe him?
- I do.

42:57.759 --> 42:59.345
I'll resign.

43:00.887 --> 43:02.973
I wish it didn't have to come to this.

43:04.642 --> 43:06.977
What do we say to the press?

43:11.148 --> 43:14.568
That you want to focus on the campaign,
that that was your plan all along.

43:14.652 --> 43:17.404
That I want to see
this crisis through, first.

43:17.488 --> 43:19.365
No one will question that.

43:21.283 --> 43:23.661
Tell Petrov.

43:23.743 --> 43:25.078
And I will...

43:26.913 --> 43:29.291
make the announcement
whenever you want me to.

43:29.375 --> 43:31.585
Claire.

43:31.669 --> 43:35.255
You were right.
I shouldn't have gone.

43:36.798 --> 43:39.426
It was your decision to make.
Not mine.

43:41.387 --> 43:42.888
Good night.

43:48.977 --> 43:50.646
My decision.

43:55.734 --> 43:58.362
Sometimes I think the presidency...

44:00.447 --> 44:02.949
is the illusion of choice.

44:27.974 --> 44:29.268
What is it?

44:29.351 --> 44:31.144
I have to go to the White House.

44:31.228 --> 44:33.188
It's the middle of the night.

44:33.272 --> 44:34.898
He's the president.

44:54.710 --> 44:56.169
Thank you, Meechum.

44:58.964 --> 45:00.132
Have a seat.

45:07.013 --> 45:08.432
I wake you up?

45:09.516 --> 45:10.892
It's fine.

45:10.976 --> 45:13.687
I'm a light sleeper anyway.

45:13.771 --> 45:16.898
If it wasn't you, it would've
been a siren or a dump truck.

45:18.692 --> 45:22.404
I get woken up in the middle
of the night all the time.

45:22.488 --> 45:25.031
Some crisis somewhere in the world.

45:26.325 --> 45:32.289
Some... situation...
in the Situation Room.

45:32.372 --> 45:34.583
Well, that's better than a dump truck.

45:45.469 --> 45:47.805
You reached out to Tim Corbet.

45:48.930 --> 45:50.683
I did.

45:50.766 --> 45:53.059
I spoke to him a few days ago.

45:53.143 --> 45:56.062
He called to let me know.

45:56.146 --> 45:57.897
So you two are still close.

45:57.981 --> 45:59.733
Not anymore.

45:59.817 --> 46:01.985
At school we were.

46:02.068 --> 46:05.405
I thought he might have some insight
to how you were back then.

46:05.489 --> 46:07.324
Those are formative years.

46:07.407 --> 46:09.785
More formative for you than for me.

46:09.867 --> 46:12.788
I learned how to march and shoot a gun,
that's about it.

46:17.125 --> 46:19.044
I would've been better off
in military school.

46:19.127 --> 46:20.420
Yeah? Why's that?

46:22.047 --> 46:25.967
You go from turning tricks
to being on the bestseller list

46:26.051 --> 46:29.346
before you can legally drink,
it messes with you.

46:30.806 --> 46:33.475
You told me your friend
was the one who, uh...

46:33.559 --> 46:35.143
I lied.

46:36.854 --> 46:40.482
Why? You ashamed?

46:48.574 --> 46:51.827
First time I did it,
I was scared out of my mind.

46:53.119 --> 46:57.249
I knock on the door, it opens...

46:57.332 --> 46:59.376
guy's in a satin robe.

46:59.459 --> 47:00.836
He's fat.

47:02.504 --> 47:05.965
Stringy hair, combed over his bald spot.

47:06.049 --> 47:09.553
Beads of sweat
rolling down his cheeks.

47:09.636 --> 47:11.722
I almost ran back to the elevator.

47:13.348 --> 47:14.892
But you didn't.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.062
No.

47:19.145 --> 47:20.272
I needed the money.

47:23.567 --> 47:25.778
Before I got undressed...

47:27.738 --> 47:30.156
he tells me that his wife just died.

47:32.534 --> 47:34.119
Car accident.

47:36.121 --> 47:39.666
Says they had plans
to visit Tokyo in the spring.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.919
Tells me about his three kids.

47:42.001 --> 47:45.255
The one that was born with a cleft palate.

47:45.338 --> 47:50.051
Describes his house in Westchester,
with a Juliet balcony in the living room.

47:51.094 --> 47:53.263
Says how beautiful she was.

47:56.725 --> 47:59.102
Tells me he doesn't want to die.

48:00.103 --> 48:01.814
Never touched me once.

48:09.154 --> 48:11.490
Sometimes it was just sex.

48:11.573 --> 48:13.700
But a lot of times, it wasn't.

48:17.078 --> 48:19.665
They would tell me everything.

48:19.748 --> 48:21.500
These men.

48:21.583 --> 48:24.336
That access.

48:24.419 --> 48:25.712
Those stories.

48:27.297 --> 48:29.883
It was an addiction.

48:29.967 --> 48:31.426
I craved it.

48:31.510 --> 48:33.345
I lived for it.

48:33.428 --> 48:35.472
And then you wrote about it.

48:36.682 --> 48:37.850
When I got famous...

48:40.560 --> 48:42.228
I had to stop.

48:42.312 --> 48:44.439
I tried it once, I got recognized.

48:47.484 --> 48:50.027
I wasn't invisible anymore.

48:50.111 --> 48:51.864
I couldn't escape myself.

48:55.784 --> 48:58.203
I wish I could do that sometimes.

49:01.038 --> 49:03.625
Escape myself.

49:03.709 --> 49:05.794
Is it Claire?

49:05.878 --> 49:09.046
You didn't ask me here
to talk about Tim Corbet.

49:12.676 --> 49:14.260
What's in this for you?

49:15.888 --> 49:17.472
I'm addicted.

49:17.556 --> 49:19.016
To me?

49:26.773 --> 49:28.734
I betrayed her.

49:28.817 --> 49:30.151
How?

49:34.781 --> 49:37.701
I'm not asking as your biographer.

49:39.202 --> 49:41.038
I'm asking as your friend.

49:54.300 --> 49:56.011
Are we friends?

49:59.056 --> 50:00.974
We could pretend to be.

50:06.897 --> 50:09.399
This isn't pretend.

50:14.613 --> 50:16.239
I'm real.

50:17.991 --> 50:19.701
You're hurting.

50:21.912 --> 50:23.830
She's hurting more.

50:32.672 --> 50:34.257
Everyone's hurting.

50:56.571 --> 50:58.448
Go home.

51:00.075 --> 51:02.577
You should get some sleep.

51:02.661 --> 51:04.245
And so should I.

51:18.551 --> 51:20.012
Thirty years is a long time.

51:21.596 --> 51:23.348
You've made it this far.

51:48.707 --> 51:50.167
Okay!

51:52.752 --> 51:53.962
Double!

52:02.345 --> 52:03.805
Jesus.

52:34.419 --> 52:36.796
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:36.880 --> 52:38.715
I didn't hear you come back.

52:38.798 --> 52:40.257
I didn't want to wake you.

52:46.806 --> 52:48.265
Wow.

52:49.266 --> 52:50.769
- What is it?
- Mid-East bureau.

52:50.852 --> 52:53.312
They say the Russians
are pulling out their troops.

52:55.023 --> 52:57.150
Whatever he did out there
must have worked.

52:59.819 --> 53:02.405
Mm... I wonder what it cost him.

53:09.495 --> 53:12.540
We ran the different looks
by a couple of focus groups.

53:12.624 --> 53:14.751
These are the three favorites.

53:17.963 --> 53:20.215
Not this one.

53:21.298 --> 53:23.218
Uh, this one. What do you think?

53:23.300 --> 53:24.719
I like it.

53:24.803 --> 53:27.847
- The hair color as well?
- Do you mind going back to blonde?

53:27.931 --> 53:29.975
I'd prefer it dark.

53:30.058 --> 53:34.146
The groups, in Iowa, in particular,
they like the blonde.

53:35.605 --> 53:37.523
Fine. We'll go blonde then.

53:37.607 --> 53:39.151
You're popular among women.

53:39.234 --> 53:42.946
We want to push those numbers as high
as we can, and every little bit counts.

53:43.029 --> 53:45.115
You don't have to explain.
We'll do the color change

53:45.198 --> 53:47.033
after we announce the resignation.

53:47.117 --> 53:48.118
Thanks, Abbie.

53:52.831 --> 53:55.000
If you don't want to,
you don't have to do this.

53:55.083 --> 53:56.209
It's fine.

53:56.293 --> 53:58.670
The nomination is not
gonna hinge on your hair.

53:58.753 --> 54:01.422
You heard what Abbie said.
Every little bit counts.

54:02.841 --> 54:04.759
We'll do what we have to.
