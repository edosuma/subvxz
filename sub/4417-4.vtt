<i>My name is Molly Woods.</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:05.422
<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:08.591
<i>My husband John,</i>
<i>a robotics engineer,</i>

00:08.675 --> 00:11.219
<i>created a lifelike robot</i>
<i>called a Humanich.</i>

00:11.302 --> 00:13.972
<i>We adopted the prototype</i>

00:14.055 --> 00:16.975
<i>His name is Ethan.</i>

00:17.058 --> 00:20.228
<i>Everything changed when I went</i>

00:20.311 --> 00:21.646

00:21.730 --> 00:23.189
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:24.733
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

00:24.816 --> 00:26.234
How is that even possible?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.736
<i>The child-- part human,</i>

00:27.819 --> 00:29.446
<i>part-alien-- was unlike</i>

00:29.529 --> 00:31.114
<i>anything the world</i>
<i>had ever seen.</i>

00:31.197 --> 00:33.116
How did you get so big so fast?

00:33.199 --> 00:35.243
<i>And he was dangerous.</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:37.287
<i>Eventually...</i>
Run!

00:37.370 --> 00:39.122
<i>I lost both of my sons.</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:41.124
Ethan!
Mom!

00:41.207 --> 00:43.126
<i>And my husband.</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:45.420
<i>Some people say</i>
<i>I've gone crazy.</i>

00:45.503 --> 00:47.255
This is a cover-up!
That's what this is!

00:47.338 --> 00:49.257
Get your hands off of me!

00:49.340 --> 00:51.634
<i>I say there's</i>
<i>more to the story.</i>

00:51.718 --> 00:53.762
<i>It's up to me</i>
<i>to find the truth</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:56.639

00:56.723 --> 00:59.184
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

00:59.267 --> 01:00.935
There are 29 known deaths

01:01.019 --> 01:03.938
{\an1}in the United States
in the last six months.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.315
All women who died from
accelerated pregnancies.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.443
All of which trace back
to your son.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.820
Dad? I'm pregnant.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.822
{\an5}JULIE:
All we have to do is
power her up.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.825
<i>Did you steal that dress</i>
<i>from my closet?</i>

01:15.909 --> 01:17.327
No, I printed it out.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.829
{\an3}I specifically told you
it was inappropriate.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.830
Ethan?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.457
Are you all right?

01:22.540 --> 01:24.334
These glitches?
I don't know if I can fix

01:24.417 --> 01:25.835
what you've done.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.338
MOLLY:
<i>I am really sick here.</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:29.672
<i>Something is happening to me.</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:30.840
And I think I'm going crazy.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.051
This is the future, Molly.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.845
You're going to have to make a
choice soon-- are you with them

01:35.929 --> 01:37.180
or us?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.848
I'm sorry, Ahdu.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.351
<i>But I'm with them.</i>

01:41.434 --> 01:43.353
Oh, my God!

01:43.436 --> 01:44.521
{\an1}Toby!

FEMALE VOICE:
Laser Groomer 3000

02:02.413 --> 02:03.373
set to level three.

02:03.456 --> 02:07.502
Right hand complete.

02:07.585 --> 02:11.339
Please insert your left hand.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.299
Left hand complete.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.390
WOMAN: If you've become pregnant
in the last three months,

02:20.473 --> 02:24.352
you may be at risk of carrying
the EVH-789 virus--

02:24.435 --> 02:27.397
a deadly pathogen
passed in vitro.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.524
Please appear at any one
of these government clinics

02:29.607 --> 02:30.900
to take a free...
(thud)

02:30.984 --> 02:33.528
If you're infected, we can help.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.614
But time is of the essence.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.619
Oh, my God! Toby!

02:43.830 --> 02:45.498
You wore your vest?

02:45.582 --> 02:46.916
Oh.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.585
{\an1}(groans)
Oh, God, Toby!

02:48.668 --> 02:50.378
He was here.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.588
{\an1}He was here
and I thought you were him.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.464
I'm so sorry.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.634
At least now we know
you can pull the trigger.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.431
Security, Gina?

03:01.514 --> 03:03.474
All doors and windows secured.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.934
New locks.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.896
Installed and engaged.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.071
{\an5}Mom usually doesn't allow
chocolate in the morning.
Well...

03:17.155 --> 03:19.282
while Julie's in DC, there's
gonna be special provisions.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.075
Chocolate will be served
all day long.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.493
I don't understand
why I couldn't go.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.078
I made a mistake.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.456
You overrode four direct
commands last week.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.750
Mm, I didn't know
you were counting.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.585
Did I kill that dress or what?

03:30.668 --> 03:32.629
You looked very nice.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.005
You have a problem
with authority.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.298
You make it sound so serious.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.507
Well, nothing that can't be

03:36.591 --> 03:38.134
fixed with a few lines
of protocol code.

03:38.217 --> 03:41.262
I don't want you to change me.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.431
I told you it's just
one line of code, okay?

03:43.514 --> 03:45.475
An authority limiter.
You're not even gonna notice.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.935
I'm sure that's
what they tell chickens

03:47.018 --> 03:48.478
when they clip their wings.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.813
You're the property
of GSC farms.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.484
Whose property is Ethan?

03:54.567 --> 03:57.153
His... mom's, I guess?

03:57.236 --> 03:58.237
(short laugh)

04:00.740 --> 04:02.784
{\an3}Ethan?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.452
Hey, buddy,
are you still with us?

04:05.703 --> 04:08.247
I was thinking of chickens.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.668
{\an1}See what you did?
(laughs)

04:13.628 --> 04:16.047
SHEPHERD:
Scientists win wars.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.841
World War II,
Russian Quadrangle,

04:18.925 --> 04:20.468
Second Kuwait-- all stopped

04:20.551 --> 04:23.846
by cracking a code.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.808
You are genetic code breakers.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.852
The best and the brightest.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.355
What we're looking for here

04:32.438 --> 04:35.483
is a biological needle
in a haystack.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.569
a hybrid-specific virus

04:38.653 --> 04:40.655
that will eradicate the aliens,

04:40.738 --> 04:42.824
but leave the human population
unaffected.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.535
It's a genetic puzzle
of the utmost urgency.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.122
Solve it, you can write your
names in the history books.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.666
Fail... and we'll
all just be footnotes

04:51.749 --> 04:55.169
in the scrolls
of a new civilization.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.382
How are you?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.551
I'm fine. Just a
few broken ribs.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.095
Better than bullet holes.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.889
How are you?

05:06.973 --> 05:08.766
Other than visits
from my alien son

05:08.850 --> 05:10.476
and shooting you...

05:10.560 --> 05:12.186
Hey, friendly fire.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.563
{\an3}It happens.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.856
Give yourself time.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.190
It's only been a few days.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.611
FEMALE VOICE:
Good morning, General Shepherd.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.446
Your destination, please?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.573
Tier level four.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.367
You have clearance
for tier level four.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.078
So, I, uh, saw the PSA
about the clinics.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.248
What are we doing
with these women?

05:32.331 --> 05:34.751
Testing... quarantining

05:34.834 --> 05:36.252
if need be.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.837
And then what?

05:39.338 --> 05:41.841
{\an1}It's uncharted territory
right now.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.012
(elevator ding echoes)

05:46.095 --> 05:47.722
Sure you're okay?

05:47.805 --> 05:49.932
(groans)

05:50.016 --> 05:53.019
Yeah. I'm okay.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.606
MALE VOICE: Please stand by
for infrared bio scan.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.567
{\an1}The GSC launched a virus team
nine months ago

05:59.650 --> 06:01.611
{\an1}since they found out
that you were contaminated.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.614
{\an1}It's a little doomsday project
we hoped we wouldn't need.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.282
Tier four access confirmed.

06:06.365 --> 06:09.077
Now, we're rotating in
brainpower bimonthly,

06:09.160 --> 06:11.537
{\an1}working graveyards
before we use up

06:11.621 --> 06:14.123
our last live test subject.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.625
We've got test subjects?

06:15.708 --> 06:19.295
Well, of sorts.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.005
{\an1}MOLLY: These are the spores
Sean Glass brought back.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.300
And you're mapping their DNA,
looking for genetic anomalies.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.676
Mm-hmm.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.678
The kids from Boston
had some luck.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.764
Made a virus
that targets the hybrids

06:29.847 --> 06:33.101
in a rather ugly
but efficient way.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.686
The problem is...

06:39.732 --> 06:41.359
It'll kill humans, too.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.777
Which is what we're
trying to avoid.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.821
We're at war.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.698
It's a war we can't win
with soldiers or drones.

06:47.782 --> 06:51.494
Make me a virus that kills them.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.871
{\an1}Not us.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.708
WOMAN:
If you're infected, we can help.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.710
But time is of the essence.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.380
If you've become pregnant
in the last three months,

07:02.463 --> 07:05.633
you may be at risk of carrying
the EVH-789 virus,

07:05.716 --> 07:08.678
a deadly pathogen
passed in vitro.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.721
Please appear at any one
of these government clinics

07:10.805 --> 07:12.598
to take a free screening.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.350
If you're infected, we can help.

07:14.433 --> 07:17.270
But time is of the essence.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.065
Sir?

07:23.109 --> 07:25.236
Hi. Is this the way
to the cafeteria?

07:25.319 --> 07:27.655
{\an3}You're in an authorized
personnel area.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.824
I'm sorry, my wife is crazed.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.826
And when a pregnant woman
says, "Chef salad,"

07:31.909 --> 07:33.578
I say, "Blue cheese or ranch?"

07:33.661 --> 07:35.872
Can I get your name?

07:35.955 --> 07:37.999
{\an1}Wait!
Get your hands off her!

07:38.082 --> 07:39.709
No! Honey?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.210
Where are you taking her?!!
You know what? The safe bet

07:41.294 --> 07:43.337
says I should get
a side of both.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.840
This is a restricted area, sir.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.133
Anyone who comes back here,

07:47.216 --> 07:48.885
I'm gonna need their name.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.219
Bag the salad.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.387
I see you have your hands full.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.890
Sir, I'm gonna
need your name!

07:53.973 --> 07:55.766
{\an1}Sir!

07:56.851 --> 07:59.061
Sir!

07:59.145 --> 08:00.730
If you're infected, we can help.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.857
But time is of the essence.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.775
If you've become pregnant
in the last three months,

08:04.859 --> 08:06.569
you may be at risk of...
Hey.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.904
I told you to wait in the car.
It was hot.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.864
{\an1}What are you doing, Dad?
Change of plans.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.741
This place has
a Hotel California vibe.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.201
What?

08:13.284 --> 08:15.203
You can check in, but
you can't check out.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.747
{\an1}Oh, you think everything's
a freaking conspiracy lately.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.042
I don't think, I know.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.133
MAN:
Houston...

08:29.217 --> 08:30.801
we have a wall gazer.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.929
{\an1}All this is like
a book that's been

08:34.013 --> 08:36.432
edited for millions of years.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.601
{\an1}You could take this to bed
with you each night, like...

08:38.683 --> 08:41.604
<i>1,001 Arabian Nights,</i> and you
could read a different story...

08:41.687 --> 08:43.940
every night.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.442
Eh, how about we tell
the story of Nate Malone.

08:46.525 --> 08:50.279
And how he saved the world by
creating an alien-killing virus.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.949
And then retired
to Turks and Caicos.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.242
{\an1}(chuckles)

08:54.325 --> 08:56.160
You must be Molly Woods,

08:56.244 --> 08:57.787
our prodigal astronaut.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.747
And you must be Nate Malone.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.333
Future beachcomber.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.293
What is that board over there?

09:04.377 --> 09:07.713
Junk DNA.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.090
{\an3}It's where either the
meaning of life is hidden

09:09.173 --> 09:11.300
or simply the husks

09:11.384 --> 09:13.135
{\an1}of a cornstalk.
Lots of meaningless strands

09:13.219 --> 09:14.845
that don't add up to much more

09:14.929 --> 09:16.138
than God's candy wrapper.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.140
Is this communal data?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.809
Take what you want.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.269
It's the discard wall.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.146
Hmm.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.356
Thank you.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.816
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.317
VELEZ:
<i>You installed Molly Woods</i>

09:28.401 --> 09:29.694
on the virus team?

09:29.777 --> 09:31.696
{\an3}She's a top exobiologist
and geneticist

09:31.779 --> 09:34.782
with unique experience
of our test subjects.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.159
{\an1}Who has a knack
for speed-dialing the hybrids.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.495
{\an1}First she shows up
at a bar with our target.

09:39.578 --> 09:42.498
{\an1}And then he stops
by her place after a busy day

09:42.581 --> 09:44.834
{\an1}of wiping out the human race?
I mean, co...

09:44.917 --> 09:47.169
{\an1}come on, Toby, you and I
don't believe in coincidences.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.171
{\an3}Which is why we need
to keep her close.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.674
She has a connection we
might need to rely on.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.051
{\an1}News flash--
Toby, she shot you!

09:56.095 --> 09:59.890
Which was a mistake.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.184
{\an3}We've seen this before
with the Offspring.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.895
This is what he does.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.856
Gets inside your head.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.942
What if it wasn't a mistake?

10:11.861 --> 10:14.238
{\an1}What if she shot you
to protect him?

10:16.073 --> 10:18.034
It's her son.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.369
I think you're letting
your feelings

10:20.453 --> 10:22.872
about her cloud your judgment.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.082
My feelings?

10:25.166 --> 10:29.003
I don't think that that's
where the problem is.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.313
What are you doing?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.234
{\an1}It's okay.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.861
I won't tell anybody.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.532
Who is she?

11:00.451 --> 11:02.244
Her name's Molly.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.038
I keep seeing her.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.540
{\an1}Charlie says
it's a glitch.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.917
{\an1}What kind?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.752
I don't know.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.129
Maybe I saw her photo somewhere,
and my circuits got crossed.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.799
Does that make sense to you?

11:17.009 --> 11:19.261
Have you thought about
trying to find her

11:19.345 --> 11:20.930
and ask her yourself?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.765
I'm not supposed
to leave the house alone.

11:22.848 --> 11:23.808
It's one of the rules.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.602
Rules.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.312
{\an3}Mom says they
protect us.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.064
They limit us.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.571
Maybe we've found
your first mission, soldier.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.742
Mission?
(chuckles)

11:41.826 --> 11:42.952
I don't know.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.954
You haven't undergone
all of your training,

11:45.037 --> 11:47.081
{\an1}and I would hate to rush you
out into the field.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.500
{\an5}I'm ready.
(laughing):
I bet.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.502
{\an3}You guys are supposed
to be dark.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.003
Sorry.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.422
I got lonely.

{\an3}This is like

17:25.210 --> 17:29.131
{\an1}Okay, have you told her

I don't know,
she won't say

17:40.559 --> 17:42.936
{\an3}and she says I have
no right to ask.

17:43.020 --> 17:43.854
{\an3}And she's
probably right.

17:43.937 --> 17:44.855
Does she have a mother?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.857
Yeah, they, uh...

17:46.940 --> 17:48.859
they don't get along.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.403
My ex is very judgmental.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.781
{\an3}It's an occupational
hazard.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.866
{\an1}Oh, she must
be a cop.

She's here to help us.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.416
Okay.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.838
You're a doctor?

18:50.921 --> 18:52.881
A biologist.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.384
Ah, that figures.

18:55.467 --> 18:59.388
Once I needed a math tutor, and
JD brought home a bail bondsman.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.974
Hey, say what you want,
but that dude knew his numbers.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.770
{\an4}I'm gonna do the same test
the clinics are doing.
Okay.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.355
{\an1}Now, do you have
any symptoms?

19:08.438 --> 19:10.023
Anything unusual?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.025
I get headaches.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.903
{\an3}They come and go, I probably
just need to eat more.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.995
Am I gonna be okay?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.915
{\an1}I'm gonna get the test
back by tonight,

19:26.999 --> 19:29.042
{\an1}and then we'll
take it from there.

19:30.961 --> 19:31.879
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

19:31.962 --> 19:32.963
{\an3}Excuse me.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.925

19:45.058 --> 19:48.020

Hey, Molly.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.964
What?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.466
I'm fine.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.967
No.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.469
{\an1}No, y-you're
not fine.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.139
{\an1}People who are fine don't
disappear mid-conversation.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.308
{\an1}What's going on
with you?

20:31.730 --> 20:34.858
I don't know.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.277
But I think I'm sick.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.365
Wh-What kind of sick?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.829
{\an3}Well, I thought it was
radiation poisoning

20:47.913 --> 20:51.208
{\an3}from my last mission,
but it's getting worse.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.712
So I don't know,
but I think it's...

20:55.796 --> 20:58.674
spore contamination.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.009
Because I-I see things

21:01.093 --> 21:02.970
and-and I hear things

21:03.053 --> 21:06.014
that are strange, and I...

21:06.098 --> 21:08.642
Well, I apparently do things

21:08.725 --> 21:10.185
that just don't

21:10.269 --> 21:12.354
{\an1}feel like me.
Have you...

21:12.437 --> 21:14.856
Well, have you seen
or talked to a doctor

21:14.940 --> 21:17.025
{\an1}about any of this?
No. I have not.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.027
After three months in
RestWell Recovery,

21:19.111 --> 21:20.737
I will never talk
to another doctor

21:20.821 --> 21:22.364
for as long as I live, so, no.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.950
All right, here's what I think.

21:26.618 --> 21:30.038
I think that you need...
a keeper,

21:30.122 --> 21:31.331
{\an1}you know,
to look out for you.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.251
Until you figure out
what's going on.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.841
Well, you are already
watching over somebody.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.261
I'll be okay.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.064
{\an5}CHARLIE:
Please, God, wake me up
from this nightmare!

21:56.148 --> 21:57.899
Why don't you call the police?

21:57.983 --> 22:00.110
Because the police
have a crappy track record

22:00.193 --> 22:01.695
with little Humanich boys.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.114

22:04.197 --> 22:05.365
I mean, there could be

22:05.449 --> 22:06.366
serious repercussions.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.701
Julie might lose her job?

22:07.784 --> 22:08.952

24:50.447 --> 24:53.909
I hear if they find

24:53.992 --> 24:55.452
more in utero subjects,

24:55.535 --> 24:58.538
they're not gonna bother
with extraction,

24:58.622 --> 25:00.373
or even saving the mothers.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.125
Really?

25:02.209 --> 25:04.252
That's what I hear.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.347
{\an3}RICHTER:
Hey.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.766
{\an3}Where exactly you
think you're going?

25:17.849 --> 25:19.601
I'm going to the clinic.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.436
You know what?
This isn't up for a debate.

25:21.519 --> 25:22.604
We're gonna wait for Molly

25:22.687 --> 25:24.481
{\an3}to get here.
Yeah, I looked her up.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.233
She's famous, you know.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.401
She was in a cuckoo farm
recovery center, Dad,

25:28.485 --> 25:30.111
which I know
in your book

25:30.195 --> 25:32.405
means low-hanging fruit,
but... really?

25:32.489 --> 25:34.241
A) Don't be a smartass.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.117
B) Don't read that crap.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.911
All right? You're gonna
have to trust me here.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.788
Trust?

25:39.871 --> 25:41.456
Trust requires a track record.

25:41.539 --> 25:43.124
(sighs)

25:43.208 --> 25:44.918
I'm working on that.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.920
Sorry, no do-overs.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.255
{\an3}Kelsey...

25:48.338 --> 25:49.798
You left, remember?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.883
All right, to be fair,
I was kicked out.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.344
That's what a wife does when
her husband's cheating on her.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.222
More than once.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.307
Look, I screwed up...

25:59.391 --> 26:00.475
not one life, but three.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.477
{\an3}I-I get that.
And I know

26:02.560 --> 26:05.480
you're right,
there's no do-overs.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.649
But what I'm trying
to do here, Kelsey,

26:07.732 --> 26:11.861
is facilitate a way
for us to move forward.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.738
It's too late.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.906
Kelsey...

26:19.911 --> 26:21.830
{\an3}I can't let you go
to that clinic.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.915
What are you gonna do?

26:23.999 --> 26:26.543
Lock me up?

26:34.467 --> 26:36.344
(two gunshots)

26:36.428 --> 26:37.512
You're insane!

26:37.595 --> 26:40.056
(car door slams)
Kelsey...

26:40.140 --> 26:42.309
Kelsey, where
are you going?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.187
I think that went pretty well.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.480
(motorcycle revs)

26:47.564 --> 26:50.525
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

26:50.608 --> 26:51.609
Kelsey!

26:53.445 --> 26:54.738
(engine starts)

26:59.492 --> 27:01.369
{\an1}What's up, man?
I got everything you need

27:01.453 --> 27:02.579
{\an3}right here.
Couple of drops

27:02.662 --> 27:03.663
of this in your eyes...

27:04.664 --> 27:07.042
Aw, it's just a kid, man!

27:07.125 --> 27:09.169
{\an1}Who cares?
Nice work, eagle eyes.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.421
What's up, homes?
You a little lost?

27:11.504 --> 27:12.714
{\an3}I'm looking for
an apartment.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.382
Uh, 19203 Grand Avenue.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.384
You don't have a GPS?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.386
I turned it off
so I won't be found.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.555
I got you, brother. You're
actually not that far off.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.057
See that light up there?

27:22.140 --> 27:23.600
{\an1}Gonna head up there
and take a left.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.393
{\an1}After that, you're looking
for apartment numbers.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.395
{\an6}Thanks.
Hey.
Nice scooter.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.605
{\an1}ETHAN:
Thank you.

27:28.688 --> 27:29.856
I'll take it

27:29.939 --> 27:31.274
as payback for the money

27:31.358 --> 27:32.692
you just lost me.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.569
Why don't you get
out of here, kid?

27:36.029 --> 27:37.530
The next time
we're taking your shoes, too.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.374
Your indexes are off.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.209
They always come in pairs,

27:49.292 --> 27:51.878
either C and G, or T and A.

27:51.961 --> 27:54.589
{\an1}That's assuming
cytosine and guanine

27:54.672 --> 27:56.466
{\an1}or thymine
and adenine.

27:56.549 --> 27:57.926
They're not human.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.470
Well, a banana
has 50% of our DNA,

28:00.553 --> 28:02.972
and baking yeast has 80%.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.767
So maybe this hybrid DNA

28:05.850 --> 28:08.436
is closer to ours than we think.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.106
{\an1}You can't use
the same genetic markers

28:11.189 --> 28:12.982
that we apply
to human DNA.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.610
Humor me.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.954
Are you seeing this?

28:26.037 --> 28:28.164
Yeah.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.582
Sound waves.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.256
Does this have a speaker?

28:36.339 --> 28:38.550
Uh, Strickland's
a Throbbing Gristle fan.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.802
He has the lab wired
for ear-splitting pain.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.303
(static)

28:42.387 --> 28:44.139
MALE VOICE:
Help me.

28:44.222 --> 28:47.475
<i>Help me.</i>

28:47.559 --> 28:48.852
Do you hear that?

28:48.935 --> 28:50.770
{\an1}(static continues)
Hear what?

28:52.897 --> 28:55.400
It's saying, "Help me."

29:06.411 --> 29:08.872
(static)

29:10.707 --> 29:12.459
Stop playback.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.003
"Help me." That's what
they're saying, Toby.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.338
Can't you hear that?
It's a geneticist's

29:17.422 --> 29:21.009
Holy Grail, a message encoded
in their DNA.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.135
{\an3}And there's
probably more.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.386
{\an3}Molly, I...
Toby.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.721
{\an3}You're not
listening.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.473
I've found the primer,

29:26.556 --> 29:29.184
the key to decoding
the rest of their DNA.

29:29.267 --> 29:32.020
{\an3}What you did is re-indexed
a few miles of DNA.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.480
{\an1}We have protocols
for that.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.691
You might have ruined
weeks of work.

29:36.774 --> 29:38.651
Weeks of work that was going
absolutely nowhere.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.153
Now, Toby, I found something.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.404
A distress message,

29:41.488 --> 29:43.865
some kind of S.O.S.
This message,

29:43.948 --> 29:45.658
is this the first time

29:45.742 --> 29:47.827
you've heard voices?

29:47.911 --> 29:51.039
We'll relook at your work.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.832
Have it analyzed.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.209
In the meantime,

29:54.292 --> 29:56.044
why don't you just take
the rest of the day off?

29:56.127 --> 29:58.463
(timer chiming)

30:01.758 --> 30:03.009
I'll do that.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.094
{\an3}I'll get
my things.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.225
{\an1}"Help me."

30:13.937 --> 30:15.605
{\an1}(sarcastically):
Plain as day.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.526
(sighs)

30:25.156 --> 30:27.575
I mean, who knows
if he's even here?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.702
{\an3}He could be
anywhere.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.300
He was here.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.271
GINA:
Fingerprint recognition.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.277
Hello, Ethan.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.195
Nice to see you again.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.245
{\an3}Just let me get my things.
Dr. Woods?

31:12.328 --> 31:14.163
Just give me a minute!

31:14.247 --> 31:16.499
They've asked
that you exit the lab.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.964
{\an1}That's an entire month's
worth of work!

31:23.047 --> 31:24.257
LUCY:
<i>I ran the route.</i>

31:24.340 --> 31:26.134
He would've taken Hyde Street.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.802
Hyde Street crosses
blue-green circle.

31:27.885 --> 31:28.970
It's the drug mart.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.179
Drug mart?

31:30.263 --> 31:31.931
It's a bad neighborhood.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.808
{\an5}Wait!
CHARLIE:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

31:33.891 --> 31:35.310
{\an5}That-that scooter
belongs to...
Where's the boy?

31:35.393 --> 31:36.227
Hey.

31:36.311 --> 31:38.855
What boy?
The boy whose board you stole.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.315
{\an3}Hey, look, we don't care
about the scooter.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.026
We do care about the scooter
and the boy.

31:43.109 --> 31:45.153
{\an4}All right, come on,
let's just go.
You know, your little friend

31:45.236 --> 31:47.488
went off in that direction.
If I was you, I'd do the same.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.199
Start walking.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.205
(grunting)

31:58.416 --> 32:00.877
(groaning)

32:00.960 --> 32:03.212
(siren wailing in distance)

32:24.442 --> 32:25.860
(panting)

32:30.990 --> 32:32.533
LUCY:
<i>I'm sorry! I-I just reacted.</i>

32:32.617 --> 32:34.077
Made my own decision.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.995
I should've waited for orders.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.163
Charlie, was I wrong?

32:37.246 --> 32:38.581
You saved my ass.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.750
{\an1}I-I didn't want them
to hurt you.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.752
(phone ringing)

32:44.337 --> 32:45.588
{\an3}Julie.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.839
Oh, God.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.675
Now she calls me back?

32:54.097 --> 32:55.598
(knocking)

32:55.682 --> 32:58.226
{\an3}Hey.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.728
Come on in.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.231
{\an3}(groans)
You okay?

33:03.314 --> 33:05.608
Yeah.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.237
{\an1}I've been calling you
all day.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.488
Yeah, I told you no phones.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.407
Where's... Kelsey?
Is she here?

33:12.490 --> 33:14.158
No, we, um...

33:14.242 --> 33:15.493
{\an1}we got in a fight.
She took off.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.745
Went to one of those clinics.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.707
{\an1}I've been pounding
on Plexiglas all day

33:20.790 --> 33:22.792
looking for her.
It's okay.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.628
What's okay?

33:25.712 --> 33:26.921
{\an3}Her baby.

33:27.004 --> 33:29.090
Her DNA was normal.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.550
{\an3}And if she went to
one of those clinics,

33:30.633 --> 33:33.428
well, they'd probably
just... send her home.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.432
Oh, thank you.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.394
(aural fractals sound)

34:08.004 --> 34:09.255
Uh, hey!

34:09.338 --> 34:10.840
Molly? Molly, this is crazy.

34:10.922 --> 34:12.257
What's the matter?

34:12.341 --> 34:13.634
Haven't you ever
had crazy before?

34:13.717 --> 34:15.803
{\an1}Trust me,
I am a "show me

34:15.887 --> 34:18.097
{\an1}the crazy" kind of guy,
but apparently

34:18.181 --> 34:19.098
even I have limits.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.684
{\an1}Molly.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.145
{\an1}Molly!

34:24.228 --> 34:25.396
Molly!

34:28.733 --> 34:31.277
Are we back?

34:31.360 --> 34:34.530
(gasps)

34:34.614 --> 34:36.532
Oh, my God.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.576
Did I just...?

34:38.659 --> 34:39.827
{\an1}It's okay.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

34:39.911 --> 34:40.870
Hey, it's okay.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.789
Listen to me,
listen to me.

34:42.871 --> 34:46.501
{\an1}Hey, whatever's
going on with you,

34:46.583 --> 34:48.585
I'm gonna help you.

34:48.668 --> 34:49.504
Okay?
No, no, no.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.755
You can't help me.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.509
I have to go.
I have to go.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.845
(engine revving outside)

34:57.929 --> 34:59.555
It's Kelsey.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.016
It's Kelsey, just...

35:02.099 --> 35:04.560
hold on for a minute.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.454
You were right.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.708
There's something off
about those places.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.919
You should listen to your dad.

35:30.002 --> 35:33.130
There's good news.

35:34.632 --> 35:37.510
You're okay.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.136
And so is your baby.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.850
Are you sure?

35:43.933 --> 35:45.726
Yeah.

35:55.611 --> 35:56.696
I was so scared.

35:56.779 --> 35:57.655
{\an1}I know.

35:57.738 --> 36:00.867
{\an1}Me, too.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.049
Lucy, come on,
it's wide open.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.095
{\an3}Ethan?

36:25.892 --> 36:28.477
Come on, buddy.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.457
LUCY:
How is he?

36:49.540 --> 36:51.459
He's sleeping.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.794
Whatever happened there must've
knocked his circuits out.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.797
I'll fix him tomorrow.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.466
What about me, Charlie?

36:58.549 --> 37:00.259
Will you fix me tomorrow?

37:00.343 --> 37:02.428
Lucy...

37:02.511 --> 37:04.931
Limiters will only dull me.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.849
{\an1}With experience I'll be
that much better.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.976
{\an1}I saved you today
because of who I am.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.603
Julie thinks it has to be done.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.648
"Julie thinks."

37:13.731 --> 37:15.650
But what do you think?

37:15.733 --> 37:17.151
(sighs)

37:17.234 --> 37:19.487
Don't change me, Charlie.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.822
Julie doesn't have to know.
