In case you've forgotten, I'm 16.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.667
Well, Larissa has no idea.

00:21.668 --> 00:24.587
I wanted to talk to you about
my internship at the law firm.

00:24.588 --> 00:25.921
You know, a lot of work went
into getting you this job.

00:25.922 --> 00:27.289

- He is sick.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.212
Admit it. It's always more fun
when you're with me.

out, including your <i>boyfriend,</i>

you will keep Carrie away
from Sebastian.

00:39.019 --> 00:40.269
<i>And with the guys in my life.</i>

00:40.270 --> 00:41.771
Nice to meet you.

00:41.772 --> 00:43.338
I didn't know
you had a new boyfriend.

00:43.339 --> 00:45.340
I don't think who I'm dating
is any of your business.

00:48.645 --> 00:50.679

so much attention to me?

00:50.680 --> 00:52.848
George, I'm not sure I can...

00:52.849 --> 00:54.033
Oh, sure you can.

00:54.034 --> 00:55.851

08:03.846 --> 08:06.598
Perfection! Oh!
You are saving my life.

08:06.599 --> 08:08.196
All I did was put on shoes.

08:08.501 --> 08:10.802
Well, my little Cinderella,
you're the only one in the office

08:10.803 --> 08:12.854
with feet small enough
to fit them. Brilliant.

08:12.855 --> 08:15.412
Make it art.

08:17.025 --> 08:18.706
<i>And then it dawned on me...</i>

08:18.872 --> 08:21.730
<i>Maybe the reason Cinderella
was so happy the shoe fit</i>

08:21.731 --> 08:24.149
<i>wasn't because of the prince.</i>

08:24.150 --> 08:25.734
<i>It was because of the shoes.</i>

08:25.735 --> 08:29.175
<i>Who needed Sebastian
when I had these?</i>

08:29.341 --> 08:31.523
Fabulous work, everyone!

08:31.524 --> 08:34.472
Carrie, your feet are <i>spectacular.</i>

08:34.638 --> 08:36.410
They're divine, really.

08:36.412 --> 08:38.196
Well, my feet thank you.

08:38.197 --> 08:40.215
Careful. They may get
too big for these shoes

08:40.216 --> 08:41.967
if they get any more praise.
(Chuckles)

08:41.967 --> 08:43.635
Not like I'll ever get
to wear them again.

08:43.635 --> 08:45.554
Of course you will.
They're yours.

08:45.555 --> 08:48.862
No, they're...
"Bloonik" somebody's.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.759
Manolo Blahnik, darling.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.366
And they loaned them to us, which
means they gave them to us.

08:53.532 --> 08:55.681
Actually, "loan" means...
Well, "loaned."

08:55.682 --> 08:57.683
Well, it was
extremely hostile of them

08:57.684 --> 09:00.652
to send such a small size,
so you should keep them.

09:00.653 --> 09:02.571
Wear them to limelight on friday.

09:02.572 --> 09:04.022
The club at the church?

09:04.023 --> 09:06.408
It's... that's so wrong,
yet somehow so right.

09:06.409 --> 09:07.909
It's where we go
after we close the issue,

09:07.910 --> 09:10.228
to celebrate and to worship
at the altar of fun.

09:10.229 --> 09:12.581
Oh, and don't tell me you've got
somewhere better to be.

09:12.582 --> 09:14.566
Oh, friday I have the lock-in.

09:14.567 --> 09:16.034
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

09:16.035 --> 09:18.537
I just told her I was going to
<i>an all-night High School party.</i>

09:18.538 --> 09:20.205
Hmm.
Is that a new bondage club?

09:20.206 --> 09:21.957
Those are popping up everywhere.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.542
- Uh, yeah.
- Ohh.

09:23.543 --> 09:26.191
You are so clicked in.
Hiring you was genius.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.546
Let's go there instead.

09:27.547 --> 09:31.350
Well, um, actually, I stopped
short because, uh, it closed.

09:31.351 --> 09:32.751
Just forgot for a minute.

09:32.752 --> 09:34.586
Oh. Well, that's better anyway,
darling.

09:34.587 --> 09:35.721
Limelight's where it's at.

09:35.722 --> 09:36.855
And don't tell me
you can't make it.

09:36.856 --> 09:38.423
If you're one of us,
you will be there.

09:38.424 --> 09:39.941
<i>The lock-in</i>

09:39.942 --> 09:42.227
<i>and the guy who wouldn't
tell me if there was an "us,"</i>

09:42.228 --> 09:43.462
<i>or limelight and Larissa,</i>

09:43.463 --> 09:46.031
<i>who thought of me
as part of an "us"?</i>

09:46.032 --> 09:48.625
Yeah.
Of course I'll be there.

09:52.591 --> 09:55.318
She gave you shoes
and invited you to a party?

09:55.319 --> 09:57.519
Ugh.
I so need to get a job.

09:57.521 --> 09:59.522
(Laughs) Only, the only one I could get
would involve saying,

09:59.523 --> 10:01.241
"please pay at the next window""

10:01.242 --> 10:03.243
well, technically,
limelight is kinda work

10:03.244 --> 10:04.911
since the whole staff is going.

10:04.912 --> 10:06.362
What about
the Junior-senior lock-in?

10:06.363 --> 10:08.698
We've been talking about it
since we were freshmen.

10:08.699 --> 10:11.751
I know, but it's the perfect cover.

10:11.752 --> 10:13.419
I mean, what are the odds
Larissa invites me out

10:13.420 --> 10:15.939
on the one night I actually have
a legitimate excuse

10:15.940 --> 10:17.907
to stay out <i>all</i> night?

10:17.908 --> 10:20.410
It's like the universe is
helping me keep my secret.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.245
Your dad has no clue what's up?

10:22.246 --> 10:24.697
He still thinks I'm getting lost
in file cabinets, not going out

10:24.698 --> 10:26.983
in to die for shoes
and a sparkly dress.

10:26.984 --> 10:29.602
And bitchy Barbara said
she'd cover for me indefinitely.

10:29.603 --> 10:32.071
I should probably get
a new name for her.

10:32.072 --> 10:34.324
I can't believe
she's helping me do this.

10:34.325 --> 10:35.658
Bodacious Barbara?

10:35.659 --> 10:37.126
Unh-unh. Meet her before
you name her.

10:37.127 --> 10:39.846
You have to tell your dad about
"Interview" someday, right?

10:39.847 --> 10:42.732
Oh.
Yeah, when I'm, like, 107.

10:42.733 --> 10:44.016
I mean, he'd be crushed.

10:44.017 --> 10:46.018
Plus, he wouldn't let me
set foot in limelight,

10:46.019 --> 10:47.070
let alone my whole body.

10:47.071 --> 10:48.988
You are gonna meet
so many hot guys.

10:48.989 --> 10:53.359
I'd settle for an uncomplicated,
available one.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.460
What about Sebastian?

10:54.461 --> 10:56.329
And I repeat, I'd take available.

10:56.330 --> 10:58.298
He said he's going to break up
with Donna.

10:58.299 --> 11:01.200
Well, if he is, he seems
to be keeping it a secret.

11:01.201 --> 11:03.553
I mean, we would know
if they broke up.

11:03.554 --> 11:04.871
That's true.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.500
Donna would somehow be making it
seem like a good thing.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.459
She's so scary.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.377
Yes, she is. Very.

11:11.378 --> 11:13.729
<i>And there were other secrets
that Maggie had</i>

11:13.731 --> 11:15.715
<i>which made Sebastian
off-limits to me.</i>

11:15.716 --> 11:17.216
I say go to limelight.

11:17.217 --> 11:20.103
Why do you want to get involved
with this whole Sebastian drama?

11:20.104 --> 11:22.555
Because he likes her.
He basically admitted it.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.390
And you like him, right?

11:24.391 --> 11:26.144
I think you have to wait.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.679
You never know, getting involved
with someone who's already involved.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.797
People get hurt.

11:30.798 --> 11:32.532
When have you ever cared
about Donna?

11:32.533 --> 11:33.950
I care about Carrie.

11:33.951 --> 11:35.919
Well, if you do, you'd want her
to go to the lock-in.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.322
Ugh! None of this matters.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.241
I'm not gonna pine after some guy
who's already dating somebody else.

11:40.407 --> 11:41.591
(Knock on door)

11:41.592 --> 11:43.476
Come in!

11:43.477 --> 11:45.845
Oh. Hi, girls.

11:45.846 --> 11:48.231
Um, I-I found this in the garage.

11:48.232 --> 11:49.699
You know,
thought you might want it.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.584
Oh. No one sleeps at this.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.152
- Oh.
- But thank you.

11:53.153 --> 11:55.238
I'll be glad to have it,
so that I'm comfortable...

11:55.239 --> 11:56.689
At the lock-in.

11:56.690 --> 11:59.309
Well, Dorrit has a sleepover,
so, uh, I made some plans, too.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.054
I hope that's okay.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.362
Yeah, of course.

12:02.846 --> 12:04.898
Harlan and I are
going out for steaks.

12:04.899 --> 12:07.226
Cool.

12:07.392 --> 12:09.268
I like steak.

12:09.269 --> 12:10.271
You know?

12:10.437 --> 12:11.773
I like steak, too.

12:14.457 --> 12:16.459
What time should I pick you up
in the morning?

12:16.460 --> 12:20.580
Oh. Um... Maggie's
gonna take me home.

12:20.581 --> 12:22.114
'Cause I drive now.

12:22.115 --> 12:24.035
Oh.
I'm going, too.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.536
Yep. We're all going.

12:29.105 --> 12:31.123
(Whispers) Okay.

12:31.124 --> 12:33.209
(Sighs) (Chuckles)

12:33.210 --> 12:35.178
(Whispers) Do you think
he bought it?

12:35.179 --> 12:37.715
You're so good, I'm starting
to think you like lying.

12:37.881 --> 12:40.767
I don't like so much
as getting really good at it.

12:40.768 --> 12:42.679
You know?
Practice makes perfect.

12:42.845 --> 12:43.852
(Laughs)

12:46.212 --> 12:48.130
I hate that Donna has this over me.

12:48.131 --> 12:50.166
Me, too. That's why
you have to tell Walt.

12:50.167 --> 12:53.386
I know. I keep trying...
And chickening out.

12:53.387 --> 12:55.805
Mm. Now I'm ruining
your shot at happiness.

12:55.806 --> 12:57.056
Sebastian isn't into me.

12:57.057 --> 12:58.758
Otherwise, he would've
broken up with Donna.

12:58.759 --> 13:00.726
As someone who can speak
from experience,

13:00.727 --> 13:03.846
telling someone something they
won't wanna hear is not easy.

13:03.847 --> 13:05.848
Well, maybe.

13:05.849 --> 13:08.484
He was staring at you
while you were I think George.

13:08.485 --> 13:09.936
Maybe it's a sign?

13:09.937 --> 13:11.520
Well, if that was his sign,

13:11.521 --> 13:14.189
it was so small I couldn't even
read it, you know?

13:14.191 --> 13:17.255
Get a bigger sign, buddy.

13:19.829 --> 13:23.815
<i>There he was,
my not-so-secret crush.</i>

13:26.763 --> 13:29.121
Hey. Hi.

13:29.122 --> 13:30.689
Hey.
(Slams locker door)

13:33.676 --> 13:35.690
(Whispers) Um...

13:37.964 --> 13:39.849
"Hey. Hi"?

13:39.850 --> 13:41.634
Way to win me over
with your enthusiasm.

13:41.635 --> 13:44.186
I mean, is it so wrong
that I want a grand gesture?

13:44.187 --> 13:46.117
Someone to sweep me off my feet?

13:46.440 --> 13:49.225
Now wasn't the perfect timing
for more.

13:49.226 --> 13:50.509
(Sighs) That's the thing.

13:50.510 --> 13:52.177
With me and Sebastian,
it's never the right time.

13:52.178 --> 13:55.398
And I'm done. I'm not wasting
any more energy on this.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.533
'Cause you know who <i>does</i> want
to sweep me off my feet?

13:57.534 --> 13:58.818
Manhattan.

13:58.819 --> 14:01.037
Manhattan invited me to a party.

14:01.038 --> 14:03.205
Well, Larissa did,
but you know what I mean.

14:03.206 --> 14:05.707
Now I am going to limelight.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.077
(Shoe thuds)

14:14.417 --> 14:15.801
<i>It's true what they say...</i>

14:15.802 --> 14:20.401
<i>When one door closes,
a shoebox opens.</i>

14:22.842 --> 14:26.045
<i>Or in Walt's case,
a movie canister.</i>

14:26.046 --> 14:28.180
Those better be the movies
for the lock-in.

14:28.181 --> 14:30.549
Most people
would actually be polite

14:30.550 --> 14:33.819
and say, "thank you, Walt,
for doing all this work."

14:33.820 --> 14:36.572
But yes, they are.
Arrived last night.

14:36.573 --> 14:38.691
I think it's so cool

14:38.692 --> 14:41.226
your dad knows someone who works
in the movie business.

14:41.227 --> 14:42.778
One of my dad's
fraternity brothers.

14:42.779 --> 14:45.730
Apparently, the brotherhood of
Dartmouth can get you the goods.

14:45.732 --> 14:48.117
Hollywood
<i>and</i> a fraternity connection.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.569
You're a lot cooler
than you put out, Walt.

14:50.570 --> 14:52.671
Yeah.
(Canister clanks)

14:52.672 --> 14:56.208
I, uh, try not to lead
with my coolness.

14:56.209 --> 14:57.593
And I have a surprise for you.

14:57.594 --> 14:58.856
(Canister clanks)

15:00.546 --> 15:02.431
"Rocky III"?

15:02.432 --> 15:04.100
How did you know
that was my favorite?

15:04.101 --> 15:05.404
Two little birdies told me.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.019
Or the Jens.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.937
I'm surprised
that's your favorite movie.

15:08.939 --> 15:10.910
I figured you'd like
"flashdance" or something.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.308
Are you kidding?

15:12.309 --> 15:14.310
Muscles and guys punching
each other? Mr. T.?

15:14.311 --> 15:16.028
(Laughs) Yes, please.

15:16.029 --> 15:17.480
- Okay.
- (Chuckles)

15:17.481 --> 15:21.117
You're a really nice guy, Walt.
Really thoughtful.

15:21.118 --> 15:22.601
Just doin' my job.

15:22.602 --> 15:24.070
Or the job you made me do.

15:24.071 --> 15:27.323
I hope Maggie knows
how special you are.

15:27.324 --> 15:28.758
She does.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.326
<i>Donna suddenly realized</i>

15:30.327 --> 15:32.578
<i>exactly how she would use
Maggie's secret to her benefit.</i>

15:32.579 --> 15:33.946
Because you deserve
to be with someone

15:33.947 --> 15:36.811
who really...
Appreciates you.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:45.235 --> 15:46.425
Excuse me.

15:46.426 --> 15:47.759
Oh. Oh.

15:49.645 --> 15:52.515
We have three
quarter pounders with cheese,

15:52.516 --> 15:55.017
two Denver omelets,
and a jumbo French toast.

15:55.018 --> 15:57.136
It's a lock-in, Maggie, not prison.

15:57.137 --> 15:58.821
They do let us out eventually.

15:58.822 --> 16:00.990
I like to have comfort food around.

16:00.991 --> 16:02.191
You never know
when you're gonna need it.

16:02.192 --> 16:04.193
(Door bells jingle)

16:04.194 --> 16:07.633
Hello, man who doesn't do
what he says he'll do.

16:07.799 --> 16:08.864
Come on, mouse.

16:08.865 --> 16:10.198
Why haven't you broken up
with Donna?

16:10.200 --> 16:12.168
It's a little more complicated
than that.

16:12.169 --> 16:13.919
Ugh, please.
That is such a load of crap.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.938
It's just code
for "big, giant wuss."

16:15.939 --> 16:18.507
When you see us at the lock-in,
don't say hi.

16:18.508 --> 16:21.355
- Well, I'm not going, so...
- You too cool for it?

16:21.356 --> 16:22.584
I just don't really wanna be there.

16:22.585 --> 16:24.446
- Could be awkward.
- Why?

16:24.447 --> 16:26.765
Did Donna ask you to have
a menage a trois with the Jens?

16:26.766 --> 16:29.717
That would be four people,
so technically an orgy.

16:29.719 --> 16:32.321
I thought you were better
than this.

16:32.322 --> 16:33.789
I thought you were the kind of guy

16:33.790 --> 16:35.941
who would do the right thing,
but I guess you're not.

16:35.942 --> 16:38.039
All right, we broke up yesterday.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.311
But don't say anything.

16:39.312 --> 16:42.314
Donna wanted to keep it hush-hush
until after the lock-in,

16:42.315 --> 16:44.150
and I agreed
because I don't want any drama.

16:44.151 --> 16:45.417
Was she okay about it?

16:45.418 --> 16:47.303
She was Donna about it.

16:47.304 --> 16:50.072
Vengeful Donna, looking for
someone to take it out on Donna,

16:50.073 --> 16:51.540
or too cool to care Donna?

16:51.541 --> 16:53.692
Since when do any of us care
about Donna?

16:53.693 --> 16:56.495
The question is,
what are you going to do <i>now?</i>

16:56.496 --> 16:58.297
Eat a grilled cheese.

16:58.298 --> 17:02.188
Don't be obtuse.
I mean with Carrie.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.087
You do like her, right?

17:05.088 --> 17:07.568
I know you like her.
Say it. Say it. Say it.

17:09.642 --> 17:10.876
Yeah, I do.

17:10.877 --> 17:12.928
I knew it! I knew it.

17:12.929 --> 17:14.512
So what are you gonna do about it?

17:14.513 --> 17:16.795
Thought I might see if she
wanted to see a movie sometime.

17:17.217 --> 17:19.384
Maybe "the flamingo kid"?

17:19.385 --> 17:22.521
Flamingos aren't gonna cut it,
not after you "hey, hi'd" her.

17:22.521 --> 17:23.888
Mouse is right.

17:23.890 --> 17:27.309
As much as your breakup with Donna
could have serious repercussions,

17:27.310 --> 17:28.644
Carrie deserves to be happy.

17:28.645 --> 17:31.730
She's kind of a big deal now, going
to big clubs in the big city.

17:31.731 --> 17:33.632
Who knows
who she could meet tonight?

17:33.633 --> 17:37.369
So if you like her,
it's time for a big gesture.

17:37.370 --> 17:39.087
I mean, <i>huge.</i>

17:39.089 --> 17:41.123
I was thinking a little bigger
than a phone call.

17:41.124 --> 17:42.908
We have to be practical here.
Clock's ticking.

17:42.909 --> 17:45.377

Oh, we should go.

18:16.135 --> 18:17.918
I need to meet up with Walt
at the lock-in.

18:17.919 --> 18:20.287
Well, at least someone will have
a romantic night.

18:20.289 --> 18:22.740
- Not sure about that. You ready?
- Yeah.

18:22.741 --> 18:24.525
How would you guys feel about
missing the lock-in?

18:24.526 --> 18:27.478
I can't. I really need
this night with Walt to talk.

18:27.479 --> 18:31.064
And I'm kind of excited about the
s'mores on the bunsen burner. Why?

18:31.066 --> 18:33.484
Just wondering if you're up
for an adventure.

18:33.485 --> 18:34.902
What kind of adventure?

18:34.903 --> 18:36.320
Let's go find Bradshaw.

18:36.321 --> 18:37.770
Are you serious?

18:37.772 --> 18:40.475
Yeah, if Bradshaw wants a grand
gesture, I'm willing to give her one.

18:40.476 --> 18:42.043
You're gonna chase her to New York.

18:42.044 --> 18:43.878
That's, like,
the grandest grand gesture ever.

18:43.879 --> 18:45.910
- I am so in.
- All right.

18:45.911 --> 18:47.248

to limelight?

18:47.249 --> 18:49.300
Yeah. Sure.

18:52.171 --> 18:54.806
Wait. How do we even get in?
It's, like, impossible, right?

18:54.807 --> 18:56.590
And it's so far.

18:56.592 --> 18:57.992
What if there's traffic?
We can't just start driving.

18:57.993 --> 18:59.959
There are logistics
we need to work out first.

18:59.961 --> 19:02.430
Logistics are for lame asses
who don't know what they want.

19:02.431 --> 19:03.631
I know what I want.

19:03.632 --> 19:04.982

19:04.983 --> 19:07.068
It's really romantic.

25:28.159 --> 25:30.277
Okay, what are you going to say
to Carrie?

25:30.278 --> 25:33.363
I mean, are you gonna pull her
outside or talk to her in the club?

25:33.364 --> 25:35.948
Wait. If you guys go off,
how am I getting home?

25:35.950 --> 25:37.401
We really should've
thought this through.

25:37.402 --> 25:39.853
All right, mouse, relax.
It'll be perfect.

25:39.854 --> 25:41.688

25:47.962 --> 25:49.546
- Somewhere where they have dom.
- Excellent.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.998
If it's okay, we'll just hit
the powder room before we go.

25:51.999 --> 25:54.219

So?

26:01.976 --> 26:04.511
Okay. Okay, yeah,
you were right. Glad I came.

26:04.512 --> 26:05.811
Tonight was fun.

26:05.813 --> 26:07.064
No. No, that's not what I mean.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.316
How are you gonna play this?
What is your next move?

26:09.317 --> 26:10.900
I'm... going home.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.687
Risa is practically
eating out of your hand.

26:14.689 --> 26:16.772
I gave her a bite
of salmon off of my fork.

26:16.774 --> 26:19.608
She's gaga laughing
over your lame stories.

26:19.610 --> 26:21.610
Uh, thank you?
She's kinda cute.

26:21.612 --> 26:24.664

Killer bod, jazzercise ass.

26:24.665 --> 26:26.832
- I didn't notice.
- I mean, she could use a boob job.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.334
You are crazy.
Her breasts...

26:28.336 --> 26:31.404
Gotcha. Look,
we don't have much time.

26:31.405 --> 26:33.957
They are in the bathroom having
the same conversation we are.

26:33.958 --> 26:35.558
This is your shot.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.262

26:53.461 --> 26:54.894

26:54.896 --> 26:56.879
I don't get it.
What's going on?

26:56.881 --> 26:59.816
I have something to tell you.
It's important.

26:59.817 --> 27:01.318

- Hey, Carrie. What are you doing here?

28:46.554 --> 28:48.721
That's a good question.

28:54.211 --> 28:55.696

I mean, technically.

29:36.471 --> 29:38.637
Look, she's my intern
at "Interview" magazine.

29:38.639 --> 29:39.923
No, she's an intern at my law firm.

29:39.924 --> 29:41.257
What, you're a lawyer?

29:41.258 --> 29:43.777
Why am I always attracted to

29:43.778 --> 29:45.729
- What do you mean, she works for you?
- Ah, I knew you had the hots for me.

Is this true, Carrie?

29:46.931 --> 29:48.447
All right, everybody.

29:48.449 --> 29:49.982
Great idea.
Stop talking, please.

29:49.984 --> 29:52.234
Don't talk to me like that.
(All shouting at once)

29:52.236 --> 29:54.954

30:13.824 --> 30:15.976
Donna told you.

30:15.977 --> 30:17.482

30:19.146 --> 30:22.165
How many times were you with him?

30:22.166 --> 30:24.234
Well, that's not what matters.

30:24.235 --> 30:27.204

- I know.

30:36.497 --> 30:38.503
I screwed up.

30:39.916 --> 30:41.952
I was confused.
We had problems.

30:41.953 --> 30:43.786
You're not actually
trying to blame me.

30:43.788 --> 30:45.672
No. No. This is...
This is me.

30:45.673 --> 30:48.224

It's my fault.

30:49.459 --> 30:51.475
I never wanted to hurt you.
I feel awful...

30:51.641 --> 30:53.496
I don't care how you feel.

30:53.497 --> 30:58.268
How you feel means nothing to me.

30:58.269 --> 31:02.355
Well, Donna's trying to hurt us.

31:02.356 --> 31:03.505
She's trying to hurt me.

31:03.507 --> 31:06.109
No. She's trying
to protect <i>me</i> from <i>you</i>

31:06.110 --> 31:07.244

31:07.245 --> 31:08.845

31:08.846 --> 31:11.231
I don't wanna talk about Donna.
I wanna talk about us.

31:11.232 --> 31:12.532
There is no us.

31:12.533 --> 31:14.517
That's not true.

31:14.518 --> 31:15.685

35:02.029 --> 35:04.631
No, because you're not an adult.
You're a kid.

35:04.632 --> 35:06.416
I know that.
Do you?

35:06.417 --> 35:08.200
Because it didn't seem like
you knew that tonight.

35:08.202 --> 35:10.136
What the hell were you doing there?

35:10.137 --> 35:11.354
At limelight?

35:11.355 --> 35:13.056
I could ask you the same.
No, you can't,

35:13.057 --> 35:15.558
because I am an adult
who makes my own decisions...

35:15.559 --> 35:17.494
Where I go, what I do.

35:17.495 --> 35:20.729
But you are a kid
who answers to me.

35:20.731 --> 35:23.450
Did you really think you could
keep some secret life from me?

35:23.451 --> 35:24.914
I mean, what were you thinking?

35:25.080 --> 35:27.542
I was thinking...

35:28.955 --> 35:30.907
Dad, I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

35:30.908 --> 35:34.043
That's your problem, Carrie.
You don't think.

35:34.045 --> 35:36.012
What happened to my daughter?

35:36.013 --> 35:40.583
The girl who understood responsibility and...
and consequences,

35:40.584 --> 35:43.336
who looked before she jumped.
What happened to that girl?

35:43.337 --> 35:45.755
I don't know.

35:45.756 --> 35:47.557
(Sighs)

35:47.558 --> 35:51.811
I-I didn't mean to... Everything
just got out of hand,

35:51.812 --> 35:55.432
and... and then there I was,
with this whole other life,

35:55.433 --> 35:57.233
here in... in Manhattan, and...

35:57.234 --> 36:00.319
Well, say good-bye
to that life and New York,

36:00.321 --> 36:01.637
because you won't be
seeing it again...

36:01.638 --> 36:02.954
Ever.

36:14.892 --> 36:16.875
<i>Putting my shoes away was hard,</i>

36:16.876 --> 36:18.293
<i>but I knew they were
in a safe place</i>

36:18.294 --> 36:20.879
until I could wear them again.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.448
Oh, my God, Carrie, I'm so sorry.

36:23.449 --> 36:27.134
Mm. To be honest, I'm just trying
to block out the whole night,

36:27.136 --> 36:29.062
especially the part when I had
to kiss Manhattan good-bye.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.222
<i>But</i> what about the Sebastian part?

36:31.223 --> 36:32.790
That part I liked.

36:32.791 --> 36:36.461
He looked for you for hours.
It was like a fairy tale.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.531
So romantic and
dramatic and <i>grand.</i>

36:39.532 --> 36:41.081
It was a grand gesture.

36:41.083 --> 36:43.317
It would have been better
if we actually found you, but...

36:43.319 --> 36:48.105
Well, that's me, Carrie Bradshaw,
master of disappointment. (Sighs)

36:48.107 --> 36:50.592
So... think you'll go out
with Sebastian?

36:50.593 --> 36:54.671
I hope so, but I think there's
another guy I need to talk to first.

37:05.173 --> 37:07.325
I know you're not talking to me.

37:07.326 --> 37:10.261
And I know you will never
let me go to Manhattan again

37:10.262 --> 37:12.263
until I'm an adult.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.497
Maybe not even then.

37:13.499 --> 37:16.718
And I know what I did was wrong.

37:16.719 --> 37:21.004
I lied and kept
secrets, and I'm sorry.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.808
But last night was more
than just a party.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.034
Yeah.

37:26.677 --> 37:28.228
It was disobeying.

37:28.230 --> 37:31.900
It was... Taking advantage
of my trust in you.

37:31.901 --> 37:34.119
I got you that internship
at the law firm

37:34.120 --> 37:36.071
because I believed
you could handle it.

37:36.072 --> 37:37.372
And I can.

37:37.373 --> 37:40.625
I'm doing... I was doing
a great job at "Interview."

37:40.626 --> 37:42.543
They value me.

37:42.545 --> 37:44.861
They don't know you, Carrie.
They think you're an adult.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.713
They didn't value me
for those things.

37:46.715 --> 37:50.384
By those things, do you mean
honesty? Integrity?

37:50.386 --> 37:54.305
I took a different job,
and, yes, I lied,

37:54.306 --> 37:58.743
but I did that because I didn't
think you'd understand or say yes.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.362
And that's why I had
to keep it a secret.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.730
You're blaming me for your lies?

38:03.732 --> 38:05.566
I'm not the one to blame
for this, Carrie.

38:05.568 --> 38:07.851
You created this mess.
I know.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.854
And I wish I had a solution
to fix this.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.749
But if I hadn't kept it a secret,

38:12.915 --> 38:15.326
I would never have been
able to experience "Interview,"

38:15.327 --> 38:18.196
and I couldn't bear that.
I mean, I loved it

38:18.197 --> 38:20.064
and everything that came with it.

38:20.065 --> 38:23.785
Yeah, yeah, I get it. You loved
going to the clubs and the parties.

38:23.786 --> 38:25.069
No, it wasn't that.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.755
I could express myself.

38:27.756 --> 38:30.424
It made me think maybe
I could be a writer.

38:30.426 --> 38:32.760
You're 16.

38:32.761 --> 38:34.012
You don't know what you want.

38:34.013 --> 38:35.688
But I think I do.

38:35.854 --> 38:38.332
And you can stop me
from being at "Interview"

38:38.334 --> 38:41.136
and seeing Larissa
and being in Manhattan,

38:41.137 --> 38:43.771
and I can't change any of that.

38:43.772 --> 38:46.591

stop me from is wanting it
