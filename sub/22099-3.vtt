SAM: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.152
I can't figure it.
All those weeks in detention

00:28.237 --> 00:30.363
and then suddenly,
they let me out.

00:30.447 --> 00:34.033
I want a specific place,
I want a specific time

00:34.118 --> 00:37.954
for a very high-level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.249
And if I don't get it,
we pick up Saul again,

00:41.375 --> 00:44.419
and this time he'll lose
more than an eye.

00:44.503 --> 00:47.839
DORAL: The child's life must
be protected at all costs.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.049
D'ANNA:
The first Cylon-human hybrid.

00:50.134 --> 00:52.468
It truly is
a miracle from God.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.053
We lost her.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.597
We did the best we could,
but she's dead

00:56.682 --> 00:58.141
and that's all
there is to it.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.643
She's so beautiful.

01:00.811 --> 01:04.272
You understand, Maya, that this
adoption requires absolute secrecy.

01:04.356 --> 01:05.356
You have my word.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.275
TIGH: There's a Raptor
out there every day,

01:07.359 --> 01:08.985
listening for
a wireless call,

01:09.069 --> 01:10.820
and it's out there
because the old man

01:10.946 --> 01:12.697
isn't just gonna
leave us to the Cylons!

01:13.490 --> 01:16.951
"Will make contact this
frequency every 12 hours.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.245
"Have hope.
We're coming for you. "

01:19.329 --> 01:20.788
The Cylons have
removed launch keys

01:20.873 --> 01:23.374
from grounded Colonial ships,
location unknown.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.918
The best option is that Saul
and the people on the ground

01:26.003 --> 01:28.171
get their hands on
the original launch keys.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.923
DUALLA: The Admiral's decided
to put some boots on the ground.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.800
He wants to send
an officer as a liaison

01:32.885 --> 01:34.677
between us and
the resistance elements

01:34.762 --> 01:36.679
on the planet to
coordinate the rescue op.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.222
It makes sense.
What's the problem?

01:38.348 --> 01:39.682
It's who he's sending.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.728
This entire plan is
a reckless gamble.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.773
You are risking the lives
of the entire human race.

01:46.857 --> 01:49.692
You should make plans to
resume the search for Earth

01:49.777 --> 01:51.819
with Pegasus and
the civilian fleet.

01:51.904 --> 01:52.987
But I'm going back.

We round up the leaders of the
insurgency and we execute them publicly.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.910
CAVIL: We round up at random groups

01:58.994 --> 02:00.870
off the street and
we execute them publicly.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.623
Send a message that the
gloves are coming off.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.291
The insurgency stops now

02:05.375 --> 02:07.668
or else we start reducing
the human population

02:07.753 --> 02:09.921
to a more manageable size.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.436
Let them stretch
their legs for a minute.

Now, I appreciate
you doing this.

I can't seem to get it
right in the mirror.

Cally's on the list.
They're gonna kill her.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.077
What list?
They're gonna kill her.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.495
What are you talking about?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.039
I got this.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.498
I got this from
the dead drop,

04:09.666 --> 04:11.083
from the source in
the administration.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.711
It's a death list and
Cally's name is on it.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.009
They're rounding up
people in the city

04:20.135 --> 04:21.969
and Cally's already
in the detention.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.179
They could take her
out at any minute...

04:23.263 --> 04:25.431
They've got this organized
by transport vehicles.

Where the frak is that?

04:30.520 --> 04:31.938
I mean, how are we gonna...

04:32.022 --> 04:34.065
Calm down, damn it!

04:34.149 --> 04:36.734
You've got to start thinking
clearly, here, Chief, or she's dead.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.737
Now, we've already figured out
their map coordinate system.

Holy frak, you're right.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.454
I can extrapolate
the coordinate system...

That'll take time.

there ahead of the trucks.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.810
Hey, there's something
that I wanted to say to you.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.524
I'm sorry that
I left you alone.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.820
I didn't mean
for you to get hurt.

17:53.823 --> 17:58.493
I was upset with
myself and not you, okay?

18:03.332 --> 18:07.419
(CLEARS THROAT) Grown-ups
do stupid things sometimes.

18:08.129 --> 18:14.968
We get caught up in our own little
world until it's almost too late.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.721
(DOOR CLOSES)

18:19.223 --> 18:22.434
You have no idea what
I'm saying to you, do you?

18:25.229 --> 18:28.023
Okay, time to take a nap.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.914
(CHIMES TINKLING)

19:38.177 --> 19:41.429
Don't be afraid. I know
who you are, what you are.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.266
Poor thing.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.270
You must be terrified.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.244
Do you have any candy?

20:05.288 --> 20:06.454
Candy?

20:08.124 --> 20:09.207
No.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.503
Kamala's so bitter.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.094
Oh, Zeus sees all.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.596
Sees you, Number Three.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.180
Sees your pain,

20:24.724 --> 20:26.391
your destiny.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.062
All the Gods weep for you.

20:31.147 --> 20:34.941
There is no Zeus.
No other God but God.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.070
Well, you don't
believe that anymore.

20:39.822 --> 20:43.909
You don't know what you believe
and that is why you're here.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.493
It's not true.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.996
I don't even know
why I'm here.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.581
This is the stupidest thing
I ever did.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.919
It is your dream
that brings you to me.

20:54.879 --> 20:57.005
How do you know about that?

21:01.260 --> 21:05.513
I have a message for you
from the one you worship.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.849
He speaks through me to you,

21:08.100 --> 21:10.101
just as he speaks
in your dreams.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.938
The message is,

21:14.106 --> 21:18.860
the fruit born of
two peoples is alive.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.074
A child named after
the wife and sister

21:24.158 --> 21:26.618
of the all-knowing Zeus,

21:28.037 --> 21:29.788
Hera, lives.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.748
It's not true.

21:32.959 --> 21:33.959
The child is dead.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.503
You will hold her
in your arms

21:36.629 --> 21:38.421
and you'll know
for the first time

21:38.547 --> 21:43.343
what it is to feel true love,

21:43.427 --> 21:46.721
but you'll lose everything
you've done here.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.399
Wish I had some
chocolate caramels.

22:09.036 --> 22:13.206
Let's move! We've got some people
waiting for their ride down there!

22:18.087 --> 22:20.088
Will you quit
looking at me like that?

22:20.423 --> 22:21.923
Like what?

22:23.050 --> 22:25.093
You know "like what. "

22:25.177 --> 22:27.929
Like we're never gonna
see each other again?

22:28.931 --> 22:31.266
We will.
It's a good plan, Dee.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.602
Take care of the Admiral.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.689
Take care of his son.

taken a look at your watch.

No, I'm just...

24:15.412 --> 24:18.915
I was just thinking Sharon's
probably on the ground by now.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.291
I know.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.796
These are your orders.

wait for me for 18 hours.

If I'm not back in
18 hours, then find Earth.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.182
Yeah, right.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.772
I'll see you at
the rendezvous point.

Eighteen hours.
Try not to be late.

and I'm a little slow.

But I'll be there.

talk you out of this.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.247

You tried.

care who I am, do you?

Good boy.
Can't sleep?

26:49.775 --> 26:51.192
Bad dreams.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.529
I didn't know you
people had dreams.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.947
Oh, sure.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.117
Yeah, everybody dreams, Doc.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.372
Is that human
or Cylon blood?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.332
Cylon.

27:07.084 --> 27:11.045
One of the Fives got pretty
shot up today by the insurgents.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.880
He's gonna make it.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.384
You could have
let him suffer.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.886
It's not what I do.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.515
What about the baby?

27:24.018 --> 27:26.185
Sharon's baby, Hera?

27:27.563 --> 27:29.897
When that child
died on Galactica,

27:30.107 --> 27:31.774
why did you
cremate the body?

27:34.153 --> 27:36.362
It's the first
Cylon-human hybrid

27:36.488 --> 27:38.740
and you threw it
in the incinerator?

27:40.075 --> 27:43.202
Oh, it wasn't my decision.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.079
That was
the president's call.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.040
I was just following orders.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.052
That's a very funny thing.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.974
Because this stuff
all looks the same.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.494
She said,

28:24.578 --> 28:29.957
"I hope it hurts you for a long, long
time before you go to Download City. "

28:33.337 --> 28:35.963
And then
they just left me there.

28:36.048 --> 28:40.301
They left me in the hot sun
with a bullet in my guts.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.428
What a noble race you are.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.435
BOOMER: How long were
you there before you died?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.062
CAVIL: Hours.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.064
Eventually,
I managed to drag myself

28:53.148 --> 28:55.316
over to some
spent shell casings

28:55.651 --> 28:59.821
and I used one of those to
scratch open my carotid artery.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.657
Skin is a lot tougher
than you think.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.953
Now that's three for me,
three downloads.

29:07.037 --> 29:09.997
The first one I just got a
headache, but I could handle it.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.124
Now it's worse and worse.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.250
This time it was like

29:12.334 --> 29:15.503
a frakking white-hot poker
through my skull.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.633
It's not worth it.
None of this is worth it.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.593
He's right, you know.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.346
It's not worth it,

29:25.681 --> 29:27.807
which is what I believe I've
been telling you all along.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.642
Caprica,
can you please control him...

29:29.726 --> 29:32.019
Why don't you just shoot me

29:32.688 --> 29:34.939
if that would
remedy the situation?

29:35.023 --> 29:36.315
DORAL:
We need to crack down harder.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.608
How?

29:37.693 --> 29:39.902
Our resources are stretched
to the max already.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.864
I don't need to
listen to this anymore.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.657
Consensus used to be so easy.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.534
Now look what
they've done to us.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.911
But don't lose hope.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.873
Worse comes to worst, we can always
nuke the city and be done with it.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.973
You'd better leave
those dog-tags here.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.808
If they spot them,
they'll know who you are.

30:10.893 --> 30:13.728
No. You have no idea
how hard I worked for these.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.147
So, our best guess
puts the launch keys

30:16.273 --> 30:17.982
somewhere in
the detention center.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.525
Now just keep to
the main streets, okay?

30:19.610 --> 30:21.068
Everybody will think you're
just a regular skin job

30:21.153 --> 30:22.320
and they'll avoid you,

30:22.404 --> 30:24.155
but there's a lot of
people out there looking

30:24.281 --> 30:26.032
to gut an unwary
Cylon going for a stroll,

30:26.116 --> 30:29.702
so don't let anybody get close
enough to stick a knife in you.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.162
All right,
thanks for the concern.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.705
Makes me feel all
warm and fuzzy inside.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.790
How are you gonna
find those launch keys?

30:34.875 --> 30:36.417
When I get inside and
hook into the data stream,

30:36.502 --> 30:38.002
it'll feed me the location.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.171
And once I get the keys, you need
to distribute them to the pilots

30:40.255 --> 30:41.297
who can fly those
ships out of here.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.466
We're already on it.
We've got pilots standing by.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.468
CONNOR: Anders?
MAN: Hey...

30:45.552 --> 30:47.094
SAM: Yeah, come in.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.306
My Gods,
what is she doing here?

30:50.390 --> 30:51.390
Get her down below

30:51.475 --> 30:53.601
and you keep her there
until after the next briefing.

30:55.229 --> 30:56.646
ELLEN: Wait a minute.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.023
No, no. No, wait. Listen to
me please. I can explain...

30:59.107 --> 31:01.859
SAM: Now, I suggest
you keep your mouth shut.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.654
ELLEN: Where is my husband?

31:04.780 --> 31:05.863
I want to speak
to my husband.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.114
SAM: Connor, let's go.
Get her down.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.449
Come on.

31:11.954 --> 31:12.912
Okay, I'm out of here.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.038
SAM: Wait, Sharon...

31:14.122 --> 31:15.289
Yeah.

31:17.251 --> 31:21.045
Do me a favor and just keep
an eye out for Starbuck.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.297
I don't know if she's
alive or if she's dead,

31:24.216 --> 31:25.800
but it's been four months.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.302
I'll do what I can.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.222
Yeah.

31:43.527 --> 31:46.279
ROSLIN: You must keep the
child hidden at all costs.

31:46.363 --> 31:50.575
SAM: We keep her on the move,
along with other high-value targets.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.785
She'll never stay
in any one location

31:52.911 --> 31:55.079
longer than two
or three days.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.874
Sam, I need you to
really hear me on this.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.585
Really.

32:00.669 --> 32:06.048
There is no one, no one, of higher
value than Maya and her child.

32:06.133 --> 32:09.135
We cannot let them
fall into Cylon hands.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.554
I get it.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.686
How far do you
want me to go?

32:19.688 --> 32:22.231
I mean, if it looks like the
Cylons are gonna capture them...

32:22.316 --> 32:23.357
No,

32:25.068 --> 32:27.445
don't let it get to
that point. That's all.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.074
I don't suppose you're gonna
tell me what this is all about.

32:32.159 --> 32:35.077
I mean, what's so
important about this kid?

32:38.707 --> 32:41.876
She may very well be the
shape of things to come.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.129
That's either
a blessing or a curse.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.802
(SHUSHING) I know.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.721
(BABY CRYING)

33:28.548 --> 33:29.757
TYROL: We've stored
arms and munitions

33:29.925 --> 33:31.175
at key areas
throughout the city.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.427
MATHIAS: I can supplement
that with mortars, RPGs,

33:33.512 --> 33:36.931
even a few shoulder-mounted
anti-aircraft missiles aboard the Raptor.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.015
Great.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.476
So, when we give the signal, our
people are gonna attack the airbase,

33:40.560 --> 33:41.727
the detention center,
the power station,

33:41.812 --> 33:43.104
and other
critical facilities.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.606
The plan is to sow as much
chaos and confusion as possible

33:45.691 --> 33:47.566
the moment Galactica
and Pegasus arrive.

33:47.651 --> 33:48.693
That should help
cover the evacuation.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.653
No Pegasus.
Just Galactica.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.780
Why? Why no Pegasus?
What happened?

33:52.864 --> 33:53.989
I don't know, sir.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.783
Way beyond my pay grade.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.702
What about your evac plan?

33:57.786 --> 34:00.037
We've designated and
assigned 500 block captains

34:00.122 --> 34:01.414
to cover each
sector of the city.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.790
Each block captain
is responsible

34:02.916 --> 34:04.208
for rallying and
guiding the people

34:04.292 --> 34:07.086
in his or her sector along their
escape route to their designated ship.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.046
I don't suppose you've been
able to rehearse any of this?

34:09.131 --> 34:11.674
Indeed. We've had three
full dress rehearsals

34:11.758 --> 34:14.343
under the guise of fire
and natural disaster drills.

34:14.428 --> 34:15.803
MATHIAS: It'll be different
when the balloon goes up.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.223
Explosions, shooting, chaos, there's
gonna be some panic out there.

34:19.307 --> 34:21.642
ROSLIN: They'll do fine. These
people know that at some point,

34:21.727 --> 34:23.978
they're gonna have to be
responsible for saving themselves.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.356
All we need to do is be ready
and hope for the best.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.402
What about Maya and Isis?

34:31.486 --> 34:32.528
I'm on it.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.696
I've got my two
best shooters here,

34:33.780 --> 34:34.780
they're gonna
be their escorts

34:34.865 --> 34:37.658
and make sure they get
back to the ship.

34:40.162 --> 34:42.663
Gentlemen, I can't tell you
why, but it is imperative

34:42.748 --> 34:46.417
that this woman and her child
get off this planet.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.502
I trust you
because I trust him.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.171
Yes, ma'am.

34:50.839 --> 34:51.922
Saul!

34:53.049 --> 34:54.675
We need to talk.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.526
RESIDENT: Toaster.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.619
SAM: She sold us out.

35:21.703 --> 35:22.953
What are you talking about?
That's a lie.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.246
We were ambushed
at the rendezvous.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.123
The Cylons knew exactly
where we were gonna be.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.792
Well, that doesn't mean
Ellen... I didn't do anything!

35:27.876 --> 35:30.461
This is the map, Colonel!
The map that I drew for you.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.504
I gave this to you
in your tent.

35:31.588 --> 35:34.131
You were gonna burn it, but then
your wife offered to do it for you.

35:34.216 --> 35:36.801
I got it off a dead
skin job at the ambush.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.219
Do the math!

35:39.679 --> 35:43.557
I want to explain, Saul...

35:43.683 --> 35:46.727
Gods-damn traitor...
Shut your frakking mouth!

35:48.939 --> 35:50.523
He said...

35:50.607 --> 35:52.608
He said he'd kill you.
Who said it?

35:52.692 --> 35:56.487
One of the Brother Cavils.

35:56.571 --> 35:59.240
I did it for you, Saul.

35:59.407 --> 36:02.076
It was all for you,
I had to.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.286
I didn't have any choice.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.288
Don't you see that?

37:01.928 --> 37:03.304
Drawer 378.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.522
What are you doing?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.483
Oh, my God, it's you.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.907
You're betraying
your own people.

37:23.033 --> 37:24.992
For what?

37:26.453 --> 37:27.828
I'm a Colonial Officer now.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.747
You're not one of them.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.123
I gave them my word.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.708
Now that's not what counts.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.210
It's who you give it to.

37:35.337 --> 37:37.129
I'm gonna have
to shoot you now.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.006
Hera lives.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.550
What?

37:41.885 --> 37:44.011
Your daughter Hera is alive.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.473
Didn't your friends
tell you that?

37:59.527 --> 38:01.779
They faked her death
and they hid her from you.

38:01.863 --> 38:03.280
You would say anything.

38:03.406 --> 38:04.823
No, I had dreams.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.451
I had strange dreams.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.288
I was having strange dreams
that made me question my faith,

38:11.665 --> 38:13.457
made me question God.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.085
And in the dreams
there was a human oracle,

38:16.169 --> 38:18.420
so I went
to see Dodona Selloi.

38:18.505 --> 38:19.672
I'm not gonna kill you,

38:19.756 --> 38:21.966
but I'm gonna wound you
so you can't warn the others.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.635
The oracle said that the
fruit born of two peoples

38:24.719 --> 38:26.387
is still alive,

38:27.263 --> 38:29.640
that Hera lives and I
would hold her in my arms

38:29.724 --> 38:31.976
and I would know
true love.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.480
Put down the gun

38:37.399 --> 38:39.858
and when I find her,
you can hold her, too.

38:48.243 --> 38:49.243

38:51.579 --> 38:53.372
Adama wouldn't lie to me.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.543
You're wrong. You're wrong!

39:08.596 --> 39:11.140
The launch keys don't seem
to have been damaged.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.558
And from all the data points,

39:12.642 --> 39:14.101
it looks like the ships
all still have enough tylium

39:14.185 --> 39:15.602
to make at least one jump.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.271
Congratulations, by the way.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.064
I heard it's a boy.

39:20.442 --> 39:23.110
What's his name?

39:23.236 --> 39:25.946
Nicholas,
after Cally's grandfather.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.490
Hey, Chief,

39:30.452 --> 39:33.078
you know when you helped Helo
spread Hera's ashes?

39:33.580 --> 39:34.580
Mmm-hmm.

39:34.664 --> 39:37.249
You actually saw the ashes?

39:37.333 --> 39:38.792
Yeah, of course. Why?

39:39.502 --> 39:40.961
Nothing.

39:43.089 --> 39:46.842
Just make sure Cally never
lets her kid out of her sight.

40:10.658 --> 40:15.996
Sir, the listening
Raptor just jumped back.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.835

Very well, sir.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.536
It's on.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.233
This is the Admiral.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.944
You've heard the news.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.863
You know the mission.

41:32.657 --> 41:36.410
You should also know there's only
one way that this mission ends,

41:36.494 --> 41:39.830
and that's with the
successful rescue of our people

41:41.332 --> 41:43.208
off of New Caprica.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.586
Look around you.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.590
Take a good look
at the men and women

41:51.259 --> 41:53.177
that stand next to you.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.639
Remember their faces.

41:58.808 --> 42:02.102
For one day you will tell your
children and your grandchildren

42:03.104 --> 42:05.939
that you served
with such men and women

42:06.441 --> 42:08.692
as the universe
has never seen.

42:10.653 --> 42:14.573
And together,
you accomplished a feat

42:14.657 --> 42:18.785
that will be told and retold
down through the ages

42:20.538 --> 42:22.831
and find immortality,

42:24.125 --> 42:26.251
as only the Gods once knew.

I'm proud to serve with you.
