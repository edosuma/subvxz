WEBVTT

00:04.999 --> 00:07.032
What do we all think
of the NYPD's

00:07.034 --> 00:09.301
illegal spying network?

00:11.938 --> 00:15.224
We need to take back
the rights to privacy!

00:15.226 --> 00:18.360
We want a police department,
not a police state!

00:18.362 --> 00:19.945
We want a police department,

00:19.947 --> 00:21.013
not a police state!

00:21.015 --> 00:23.199
Come out, come out,
Commissioner!

00:23.201 --> 00:25.217
We just want to talk!

00:25.219 --> 00:28.871
Commissioner Reagan
can't hear you!

00:28.873 --> 00:31.707
We want a
police department, not a police state!

00:31.709 --> 00:33.159
We want a police department,

00:33.161 --> 00:34.376
not a police state!

00:35.945 --> 00:36.996
They call themselves

00:36.998 --> 00:39.165
The Citizens for Police
Accountability.

00:39.167 --> 00:40.249
That's a mouthful.

00:40.251 --> 00:41.584
CPA for short.

00:41.586 --> 00:44.119
The accounting profession
ought to sue.

00:45.639 --> 00:47.723
You know, if we had a balcony
and some water balloons,

00:47.725 --> 00:49.141
we could really have some fun.

00:50.428 --> 00:53.095
Ms., uh, Robshaw
should be here.

00:53.097 --> 00:54.346
Who again?

00:54.348 --> 00:55.964
Whitney Robshaw.

00:55.966 --> 00:57.566
Newly elected
to the executive board

00:57.568 --> 00:58.634
for the ACLU.

00:58.636 --> 01:00.519
What is this, Get Frank Day?

01:00.521 --> 01:02.321
Uh, actually, she's reaching out

01:02.323 --> 01:04.355
in an effort to establish
better cohesion

01:04.358 --> 01:07.326
between the NYPD
and her organization.

01:07.328 --> 01:08.778
Okay.

01:10.147 --> 01:11.297
Ms. Robshaw,
Commissioner.

01:11.299 --> 01:12.314
Thank you.

01:12.316 --> 01:13.632
Hello.

01:13.634 --> 01:14.867
Commissioner Reagan,
Whitney Robshaw.

01:14.869 --> 01:16.035
Nice to meet you.

01:16.037 --> 01:17.369
Very nice to meet you.

01:17.371 --> 01:20.089
Actually, um, we have met before.
Really?

01:20.091 --> 01:21.590
Yes. Very nice to see you again,
Commissioner.

01:21.592 --> 01:23.826
I'm sorry.
I can't place where.

01:23.828 --> 01:25.678
Don't kill yourself.
It was a whole other context.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.630
Give me a second here.

01:28.298 --> 01:29.465
You want a hint?

01:29.467 --> 01:32.101
No, I'm going to get it.

01:32.103 --> 01:33.269
You're a friend of Erin's.

01:33.271 --> 01:34.887
Oh, very good.

01:34.889 --> 01:35.888
Thank you.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.690
We met at her
40th birthday party.

01:37.692 --> 01:39.608
Well, I think she prefers
to call it

01:39.610 --> 01:41.310
the tenth anniversary
of her 30th.

01:41.312 --> 01:43.312
"Beauty may be fleeting,

01:43.314 --> 01:45.147
but stubbornness is forever."

01:45.982 --> 01:47.483
Excuse me?

01:47.485 --> 01:48.851
It's the toast.

01:48.853 --> 01:50.686
What?
The toast you gave to Erin that night?

01:50.688 --> 01:51.687
Oh.

01:51.689 --> 01:52.788
I've stolen it

01:52.790 --> 01:54.623
for every other toast
I've done since.

01:54.625 --> 01:55.624
Oh. Thank you.

01:55.626 --> 01:56.692
The commissioner has kind of

01:56.694 --> 01:58.210
a packed day,
if we could dive in here.

01:58.212 --> 01:59.662
Right.
Yeah. Please.

01:59.664 --> 02:01.046
Thank you.

02:05.869 --> 02:07.720
Let me just

02:07.722 --> 02:08.704
start off by...

02:08.705 --> 02:10.055
You were walking with a cane.

02:11.308 --> 02:14.093
Yes.

02:14.095 --> 02:15.978
I tore my ACL skiing.

02:15.980 --> 02:17.212
How's the knee?

02:17.214 --> 02:19.148
It's all better, thank you.

02:19.150 --> 02:21.066
Good, good.

02:21.068 --> 02:23.068
If we're done
with the medical update?

02:26.022 --> 02:27.323
So, Commissioner...

02:29.559 --> 02:32.278
What? That's completely
counterintuitive.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.729
Next customer in line.

02:33.731 --> 02:36.398
- Hi.
Uh-huh. Well...

02:36.400 --> 02:39.451
So what's their
market capitalization?

02:39.453 --> 02:41.086
Uh-huh.

02:41.905 --> 02:43.289
Let's go.

02:43.291 --> 02:45.541
Let's go. Let's go.

02:45.543 --> 02:47.343
It's on my desk.

02:47.345 --> 02:49.011
My desk!

02:51.882 --> 02:54.750
Police. Don't move.

02:57.137 --> 02:58.470
Please don't
make me shoot you.

02:58.472 --> 03:00.756
Hand my boyfriend your gun.
All right, now, everybody...

03:00.758 --> 03:02.591
Everybody on the ground now!
You get on the ground!

03:02.593 --> 03:03.809
Hey, everybody,
on the ground now.

03:03.811 --> 03:05.778
You in the back, now!
We don't want to hurt

03:05.780 --> 03:07.563
anyone, okay?
And we don't want your money.

03:07.565 --> 03:08.597
We just want
the bank's.

03:08.599 --> 03:09.865
Think about how
much they got

03:09.867 --> 03:11.099
in the bailouts, okay?

03:11.101 --> 03:12.284
The banks are
the real crooks here, not us.

03:12.286 --> 03:13.903
They're robbing the bank.

03:13.905 --> 03:15.454
Hey, you!
No phones, no phones!

03:16.624 --> 03:17.907
What did you do?

03:17.909 --> 03:20.275
What did you do?

03:22.946 --> 03:24.129
I-I don't know.

03:24.131 --> 03:26.165
Okay? I don't know.
It just went off. I swear.

03:28.969 --> 03:30.636
Look, we got to... Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:30.638 --> 03:32.755
Hey, where she go? Where did she go?
Give me the money!

03:32.757 --> 03:33.973
We have to get
out of here now.

03:33.975 --> 03:36.058
We have to go.
We have to get out of here!

03:36.060 --> 03:38.427
All right, come on.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.380
Stay on the ground!

03:45.602 --> 03:47.636
So how long were you,
uh, liaising

03:47.638 --> 03:48.971
with those pukes
in the FBI

03:48.973 --> 03:50.189
on bank robberies,
anyway?

03:50.191 --> 03:51.190
Three years.

03:51.192 --> 03:52.474
Three years. Wow.

03:52.476 --> 03:54.543
Till the commissioner
disbanded the joint task force.

03:54.545 --> 03:56.445
Oh, well, that's because
he realized how much of

03:56.447 --> 03:58.197
a time-suck
the Feds can be.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.455
All right, that's him.

04:06.457 --> 04:08.007
Let's remember where
your loyalties lie, all right?

04:08.009 --> 04:09.842
He's one of us, so be nice.

04:09.844 --> 04:12.211
You've known me ten years,
Danny. When am I not nice?

04:12.213 --> 04:14.380
You, on the
other hand...

04:14.382 --> 04:15.364
Officer Haskins?

04:15.366 --> 04:17.332
For the time being.

04:17.334 --> 04:18.434
They'll probably
throw me off the job

04:18.435 --> 04:19.718
for this jackpot,
though.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.637
Yeah, well, look,
I'm Detective Reagan.

04:21.639 --> 04:22.688
This is Detective Baez.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.172
Ah, man.

04:24.174 --> 04:25.858
Just when I thought
my day couldn't get any worse.

04:25.860 --> 04:26.859
You're the commissioner's son.

04:26.861 --> 04:28.227
Yeah, well, look,
I'm not here

04:28.229 --> 04:30.195
in that capacity, okay?
So you can relax.

04:30.197 --> 04:32.314
Relax?

04:32.316 --> 04:33.365
Never in a million years

04:33.367 --> 04:34.783
did I think that girl
was with him.

04:34.785 --> 04:35.851
You were off-duty.

04:35.853 --> 04:36.618
Yeah.

04:36.620 --> 04:37.786
Yeah. And most guys

04:37.788 --> 04:39.154
would've called it in,
but you stepped up.

04:39.156 --> 04:40.823
And got a guy shot.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.792
Perp says it was an
accident, but I don't know.

04:43.794 --> 04:46.328
Looked to me like
it was in cold blood.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.914
With my gun.

04:48.916 --> 04:50.165
Look, we'll get your piece back

04:50.167 --> 04:51.968
before they can do
any more damage, all right?

04:51.969 --> 04:53.135
You got my word.

04:53.970 --> 04:56.338
FBI already bit into
me good for that.

04:57.474 --> 04:59.224
Why do they got
to be in on this?

05:00.844 --> 05:02.061
Banks are
federally insured.

05:02.063 --> 05:03.429
Yeah.

05:03.431 --> 05:05.681
And speaking
of the Feds...

05:05.683 --> 05:07.516
Agents Cook and Valko.

05:07.518 --> 05:08.567
We should check in.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.069
Nah, I don't check
in with Feebs.

05:10.071 --> 05:11.737
Don't worry, I'll make
sure they know

05:11.739 --> 05:12.888
who's kissing
whose ring.

05:12.890 --> 05:15.024
Hang tight.
We'll get your statement

05:15.026 --> 05:16.275
in a minute, okay?

05:16.277 --> 05:17.409
Everything's
gonna be fine.

05:17.411 --> 05:18.894
All right.

05:18.896 --> 05:21.563
In my experience, when a perp
get his mitts on a cop's gun,

05:21.565 --> 05:23.165
rarely does it
turn out fine.

05:23.167 --> 05:24.249
I know.

05:24.251 --> 05:25.250
Oh, hey,

05:25.252 --> 05:26.585
you two.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.253
What happened?
You crack the case already?

05:28.255 --> 05:31.406
Maria, there was another bank
just hit 12 blocks from here.

05:31.408 --> 05:33.125
Male/female team, same M.O.

05:33.127 --> 05:34.376
Kicked it up a notch.

05:34.378 --> 05:36.261
Tell me there's
no more casualties.

05:36.263 --> 05:38.881
Luckily, there was
no off-duty NYPD there

05:38.883 --> 05:40.215
to get anyone shot.

05:40.217 --> 05:41.683
Ha, ha, ha.

05:41.685 --> 05:43.886
That's funny.

You were late.

06:23.287 --> 06:25.638
Don't burgers usually

06:25.640 --> 06:27.473
Is that meant to be funny?

06:30.794 --> 06:33.729
So, Maria, we know
they fled on foot

06:33.731 --> 06:35.481
with six grand
from the second bank job.

06:35.483 --> 06:38.351
Your lab lift any prints
of value off the holdup notes?

06:38.353 --> 06:40.135
None that were in the system.

06:40.137 --> 06:42.521
The first note
was computer-printed.

06:42.523 --> 06:43.739
Second, hand-written
on the fly.

06:43.741 --> 06:45.474
"No silent alarm.

06:45.476 --> 06:47.493
Slip me a dye pack, you die."

06:47.495 --> 06:49.144
Definitely not first-timers.
We know.

06:49.146 --> 06:51.580
Yeah, three bank jobs
in the last two months.

06:51.582 --> 06:53.582
We dubbed him
the Protest Bandit,

06:53.584 --> 06:55.284
based on the anti-bank rhetoric

06:55.286 --> 06:56.836
in the notes.
Yeah...

06:56.838 --> 06:58.087
You know,
I noticed how

06:58.089 --> 06:59.655
you do that-- you
give little, uh...

06:59.657 --> 07:01.657
"bandit" nicknames to everyone.

07:01.659 --> 07:03.659
Yeah, it captures
the public's attention.

07:03.661 --> 07:05.544
It increases the volume of tips.

07:05.546 --> 07:06.929
Yeah, I get that.

07:06.931 --> 07:09.215
I was thinking about naming
these two Bonnie and Clyde.

07:09.217 --> 07:11.333
That's good. I like that.

07:11.335 --> 07:12.718
But you chose to name them

07:12.720 --> 07:14.169
the Protest Bandit.

07:14.171 --> 07:16.806
Bandit being singular,
not plural.

07:16.808 --> 07:19.392
Yeah, because he was believed
to have acted alone.

07:19.394 --> 07:21.777
Yeah, it was believed
he acted alone, but...

07:21.779 --> 07:23.195
there she is in
a floppy hat

07:23.197 --> 07:25.398
in this one, and
an orange beret

07:25.400 --> 07:26.782
in this one.

07:27.617 --> 07:29.735
We realize that now.

07:29.737 --> 07:31.203
Yep.

07:31.205 --> 07:34.073
What does FBI stand for, anyway?
Famous But Incompetent?

07:34.075 --> 07:35.875
Reagan...

07:35.877 --> 07:37.376
Today was the first holdup

07:37.378 --> 07:40.046
where "Bonnie" needed
to participate.

07:40.048 --> 07:41.964
And you busted our balls

07:41.966 --> 07:43.866
over an off-duty officer
trying to play hero,

07:43.868 --> 07:45.801
when they were actually
just trying to help out?

07:45.803 --> 07:48.170
Okay, you know what?
In the interest of expediency,

07:48.172 --> 07:49.505
maybe we should run
parallel investigations.

07:49.507 --> 07:51.307
With the proviso we share

07:51.309 --> 07:53.041
any pertinent information
as it comes to light?

07:53.043 --> 07:54.593
Yeah. Sounds good.

07:54.595 --> 07:56.545
Yeah. I think, uh...

07:56.547 --> 07:58.764
that works gangbusters
for me, too.

07:58.766 --> 08:01.650
We're gonna need
separate checks.

08:04.020 --> 08:05.571
You want to buzz again?

08:05.573 --> 08:06.989
Give it another minute.

08:06.991 --> 08:09.158
Then you want to call
over to the mayor's office,

08:09.160 --> 08:10.609
tell them we're running
even later?

08:12.662 --> 08:14.396
Just hold on and look
at the logic.

08:14.398 --> 08:15.498
You ready?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.032
Well past.

08:17.034 --> 08:18.233
Think about it.

08:18.235 --> 08:19.335
The police in this city

08:19.337 --> 08:20.703
have their hands full

08:20.705 --> 08:22.237
keeping ahead of criminals.

08:22.239 --> 08:24.573
What gain would there be
wasting manpower harassing

08:24.575 --> 08:25.791
law-abiding
citizens?

08:25.793 --> 08:27.376
Oh. That's <i>your</i> logic.

08:27.378 --> 08:28.511
Not just mine.

08:28.513 --> 08:30.245
And it doesn't jibe
with public perception.

08:30.247 --> 08:32.097
Well, then help me change
public perception.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.248
Oh, right.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.184
The ACLU in cahoots
with the NYPD?

08:36.187 --> 08:37.586
Show me the
logic in that.

08:37.587 --> 08:39.138
I could, but you
wouldn't listen.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.306
Try me.

08:44.227 --> 08:45.895
I don't get it.

08:45.897 --> 08:47.947
These kids are young
and good-looking and,

08:47.949 --> 08:50.316
judging by the lack
of typos, educated.

08:50.318 --> 08:52.818
What the hell is this crazy
vendetta against the banks?

08:52.820 --> 08:55.121
I once saw you kick
a hole in the wall

08:55.123 --> 08:56.772
over a 20-buck overdraft fee.

08:56.774 --> 08:59.291
Okay, but I didn't go
shooting up a bank over it.

08:59.293 --> 09:01.327
You're a paragon of restraint.

09:01.329 --> 09:03.278
Wait a minute.

09:04.965 --> 09:06.749
I might have
something here.

09:06.751 --> 09:08.801
Failed bank robbery attempt
three months ago in Jersey.

09:08.803 --> 09:10.052
Look at the picture.

09:10.054 --> 09:11.670
Is that Clyde?

09:11.672 --> 09:13.055
A little shaggier,
but yeah.

09:13.057 --> 09:14.623
I see why the FBI missed it.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.309
Well, the FBI couldn't find
their own asses with a GPS,

09:17.311 --> 09:18.561
but I digress.

09:18.563 --> 09:20.346
The whole M.O. is different.

09:20.348 --> 09:21.430
No gun displayed,

09:21.432 --> 09:23.465
no expert knowledge
in the holdup note.

09:23.467 --> 09:26.318
Right. No anti-bank manifesto.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.736
Even the handwriting
is different.

09:27.738 --> 09:29.772
Maybe that's 'cause
he didn't have Bonnie yet.

09:29.774 --> 09:30.973
Look at this.

09:30.975 --> 09:33.308
She's nowhere to be found
in the background.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.644
Maybe he didn't get good
until they became a team.

09:35.646 --> 09:36.912
Well, that's great,

09:36.914 --> 09:38.581
but this is the coldest
of the cases.

09:38.583 --> 09:39.748
The coldest
of the cases

09:39.750 --> 09:41.417
being the earliest of the cases.

09:41.419 --> 09:42.484
The one in which Clyde

09:42.486 --> 09:44.319
was likely to make
the most mistakes.

09:44.321 --> 09:47.006
Maybe one of those mistakes can
lead us to his real identity.

09:47.008 --> 09:49.041
You up for taking a ride to Jersey?
No.

09:49.043 --> 09:51.377
Come on, it smells great
this time of year.

10:03.106 --> 10:04.990
What about this suit?

10:04.992 --> 10:07.393
Not the price;
just the suit.

10:07.395 --> 10:11.179
Okay? It's a steal.
Trust me.

10:12.782 --> 10:14.950
Okay.
It's nice.

10:16.686 --> 10:18.320
What do you think?

10:18.322 --> 10:20.039
What am I supposed to think?

10:20.041 --> 10:23.158
Think of it
as a coat of armor.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.793
So when I call you
to the stand

10:24.795 --> 10:26.295
and you walk
by that monster,

10:26.297 --> 10:28.530
you can say,

10:28.532 --> 10:30.032
"Everything
you took from me,

10:30.034 --> 10:31.533
I'm taking it back."

10:33.420 --> 10:35.304
That's gonna take
a little more than a coat.

10:35.306 --> 10:37.423
I know it is.

10:37.425 --> 10:38.641
You said you
didn't have anything

10:38.643 --> 10:40.175
to wear in court.
I just thought we'd...

10:40.177 --> 10:41.376
Who is that?

10:44.814 --> 10:45.814
I have no idea.

10:45.816 --> 10:47.182
Why is he taking
my picture?

10:47.184 --> 10:48.684
I don't know. Go into
the dressing room.

10:48.686 --> 10:50.336
I'll be right back.

10:51.605 --> 10:53.806
Who the hell
are you?

10:53.808 --> 10:55.274
What are you taking
pictures for?

10:55.276 --> 10:56.775
An exposé.

10:56.777 --> 10:59.545
On your father and his
nepotistic dynasty!

10:59.547 --> 11:01.580
For who?

11:01.582 --> 11:04.283
For anyone brave enough to pick
up the story, but for now,

11:04.285 --> 11:06.068
the Citizens for Police
Accountability Web site.

11:06.070 --> 11:08.003
Okay, you need to stop
taking pictures now.

11:08.005 --> 11:09.404
New York tax dollars
pay your salary.

11:09.406 --> 11:10.789
So, why are you
out here shopping

11:10.791 --> 11:11.924
in the middle of a work day?

11:11.926 --> 11:13.926
Did you hear what I said?
You need to stop.

11:13.928 --> 11:16.378
You're a private citizen
on a public street.

11:16.380 --> 11:19.265
Your father doesn't think
you're entitled to any privacy.

11:19.267 --> 11:22.468
Hey, the person I am with is a
victim in a sexual abuse trial.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.086
You need to delete
her photos now.

11:24.088 --> 11:25.938
You're just a chip off
the old block, aren't you?

11:25.940 --> 11:27.039
Hey!

11:27.041 --> 11:28.107
Hey, what the
hell you doing?

11:28.109 --> 11:30.726
What I said I was going to do.

11:30.728 --> 11:32.227
You know,
I can sue you for that.

11:32.229 --> 11:33.946
Yeah, go for it.

11:33.948 --> 11:35.397
Good luck with that.

11:35.399 --> 11:37.983
Here you go.

11:38.868 --> 11:40.069
Hey!

11:40.637 --> 11:42.871
What are you hiding?

11:42.873 --> 11:44.606
What are you hiding?
What are you doing?

11:44.608 --> 11:45.658
What are you hiding?
Stop! Stop it!

11:45.660 --> 11:46.709
What are you hiding?

11:46.711 --> 11:48.327
Leave her alone.

11:48.329 --> 11:49.545
What is wrong with you?

11:49.547 --> 11:50.963
Jana.

11:50.965 --> 11:53.582
Do you have any idea
what you just did?

11:53.584 --> 11:54.800
Yeah, well,
according to your daddy,

11:54.802 --> 11:56.218
if she's not
doing anything illegal,

11:56.220 --> 11:57.553
it shouldn't bother her.

11:59.773 --> 12:01.473
<i>Thanks for</i>
<i>answering my questions</i>

12:01.475 --> 12:02.808
<i>on your lunch break.</i>

12:02.810 --> 12:04.960
Actually,
I-I was held up once before.

12:04.962 --> 12:06.645
Oh, yeah?

12:06.647 --> 12:08.564
Yeah, I slipped
the guy a dye pack.

12:08.566 --> 12:10.465
Couple of minutes later,
he's walking down the street,

12:10.467 --> 12:14.153
a cop sees pink smoke
billowing out of his pants.

12:14.155 --> 12:15.470
That's great,
but I'll tell you what,

12:15.472 --> 12:17.472
can we just focus
on the one still at large, okay?

12:17.474 --> 12:19.742
This photo's from
three months ago.

12:19.744 --> 12:21.476
Well, it-it's like I told you
on the phone last night.

12:21.478 --> 12:23.529
I mean,
something spooked this guy,

12:23.531 --> 12:25.080
and  he bolted.

12:25.082 --> 12:26.582
What about this girl?

12:26.584 --> 12:28.534
She wasn't here
that day, was she?

12:28.536 --> 12:29.868
Uh, yeah, of course she was.

12:29.870 --> 12:32.788
She's not in any
of the surveillance photos

12:32.790 --> 12:34.173
from the robbery at this bank.

12:34.175 --> 12:36.508
Yeah, but this angle
only shows the customers.

12:36.510 --> 12:38.493
She's an employee?

12:38.495 --> 12:39.595
Was.

12:39.597 --> 12:40.929
Yeah, she worked
the window right beside me.

12:40.931 --> 12:43.515
She hated this job.

12:43.517 --> 12:46.168
She used to daydream
of somebody swooping in

12:46.170 --> 12:49.021
and taking her away from all
the drudgery of it all.

12:49.023 --> 12:50.522
You got a name on her?

12:50.524 --> 12:51.607
Sylvie.

12:51.609 --> 12:53.842
Sylvie, uh... Freeland.

12:53.844 --> 12:56.195
Sylvie Freeland.

12:56.197 --> 12:59.982
You know, come to think of it,
she... she quit,

12:59.984 --> 13:02.851
like, the
very next day.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.382
Come on, keep looking.

13:12.384 --> 13:13.883
Whoever finds
that stolen Glock's

13:13.885 --> 13:15.468
getting a steak dinner
on the arm.

13:15.470 --> 13:16.803
Compliments of me.

13:16.805 --> 13:17.937
Sylvie's part in
the first holdup

13:17.939 --> 13:19.806
still doesn't make
any sense to me.

13:19.808 --> 13:22.875
Well, apparently she was still
just a bank teller

13:22.877 --> 13:24.410
and not yet a bank robber.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.063
I know, but it's not like Clyde
took any hostages.

13:27.065 --> 13:28.981
He didn't pull a Patty Hearst

13:28.983 --> 13:31.067
and brainwash her
into becoming a bank robber.

13:31.069 --> 13:32.869
Well, I don't know. Maybe they
already knew each other.

13:32.871 --> 13:33.936
I mean, the, uh, teller said

13:33.938 --> 13:35.121
that Dylan saw something
that spooked him.

13:35.123 --> 13:36.572
Maybe that was it.

13:36.574 --> 13:39.041
Maybe he saw Sylvie and thought,
"She's going to turn me in."

13:39.043 --> 13:40.793
Yeah, and then there's
the obvious, which is:

13:40.795 --> 13:43.612
Maybe they were already a couple
and it was an inside job.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.715
You know who'd really love
to weigh in on this?

13:45.717 --> 13:47.800
Don't start with the Feebs
again, please.

13:47.802 --> 13:49.135
Agent Valko.

13:49.137 --> 13:50.786
Yeah, we really
should've notified her...

13:50.788 --> 13:52.955
No, I don't think
you understand. I live here.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.140
I don't understand
what you're doing here.

13:54.142 --> 13:55.508
What-what do you mean,
I can't come in?

13:55.510 --> 13:56.676
This is my apartment.

13:56.678 --> 13:59.178
Well, unless she's
a master of disguise,

13:59.180 --> 14:00.430
that's not our girl.

14:00.432 --> 14:01.814
It's all right.
Let her in.

14:01.816 --> 14:04.100
What's your
name, ma'am?

14:04.102 --> 14:05.401
Diane Morris.

14:05.403 --> 14:06.319
What is this?

14:06.321 --> 14:07.803
Uh, this is
a search warrant.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.489
And we need to ask
you some questions.

14:09.491 --> 14:11.240
Why don't you come
sit down, okay?

14:13.777 --> 14:15.361
We're looking
for Sylvie.

14:15.363 --> 14:16.579
You seen her?

14:16.581 --> 14:18.147
I have no idea
where she is.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.166
She moved out about
three months ago.

14:20.168 --> 14:21.868
The lease
is still in her name?

14:21.870 --> 14:23.619
Because they evict subletters.

14:23.621 --> 14:24.653
What about the utilities?

14:24.655 --> 14:25.788
They're still in her name, too.

14:25.790 --> 14:27.340
Sylvie left a note
saying to leave

14:27.342 --> 14:29.609
all the unpaid bills
in her name.

14:29.611 --> 14:31.294
So it wouldn't hurt my credit.

14:31.296 --> 14:33.546
Hers was already trashed.

14:33.548 --> 14:35.097
Why? She had a full-time job.

14:35.099 --> 14:37.383
Yeah, but that paycheck
barely covered her necessities.

14:37.385 --> 14:40.269
I mean, her student loans alone
were over $100,000.

14:40.271 --> 14:41.337
$100,000?

14:41.339 --> 14:43.189
Wow. I got two kids to put
through college.

14:43.191 --> 14:44.724
Maybe you should start
robbing banks, too.

14:44.726 --> 14:47.276
Yeah.
What, you think Sylvie robbed a bank?

14:47.278 --> 14:48.394
That's crazy.

14:48.396 --> 14:49.979
She has a degree in finance
from Allegheny.

14:49.981 --> 14:51.680
Well, she's certainly making
a name for herself

14:51.682 --> 14:53.015
in the banking industry.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.986
This really didn't turn out
the way she expected here.

14:56.988 --> 14:59.956
I mean, she was so miserable,
she went on antidepressants.

14:59.958 --> 15:02.625
And then there's
her bad taste in men.

15:02.627 --> 15:04.744
Who's he?

15:07.080 --> 15:10.466
Oh, God, I think it's
that guy Dylan.

15:10.468 --> 15:11.534
Dylan who?

15:11.536 --> 15:12.752
Sanders, maybe?

15:12.754 --> 15:14.971
And, let me guess,
he's a Rhodes Scholar?

15:14.973 --> 15:17.974
No, we met him
at a party last year.

15:17.976 --> 15:20.009
Sylvie completely fell for his

15:20.011 --> 15:22.929
"we're the most screwed-over
generation" shtick.

15:22.931 --> 15:24.063
He wasn't even into her.

15:24.065 --> 15:26.715
Well, looks like they found
a common interest.

15:34.908 --> 15:37.560
You know, back in the days
of the real Bonnie and Clyde,

15:37.562 --> 15:38.861
banks had just
wiped everyone out,

15:38.863 --> 15:39.912
started the
Great Depression.

15:39.914 --> 15:42.999
I think I got Dylan's mom.

15:43.001 --> 15:45.067
Uh, hello, Mrs. Sanders?

15:45.069 --> 15:46.202
Yes, uh, my name is Danny.

15:46.204 --> 15:47.453
Uh, I don't know
if you remember me.

15:47.455 --> 15:48.955
I went to high school
with Dylan.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.091
Well, that's okay.
I'm sure Dylan will remember me.

15:52.093 --> 15:54.910
Look, um, the reason I'm calling
is I work for a firm

15:54.912 --> 15:56.262
in the city, and, um,

15:56.264 --> 15:58.214
we have a position
that opened up.

15:58.216 --> 16:00.749
I was wondering if Dylan
was looking for work.

16:00.751 --> 16:04.804
Uh-huh. Well, do you have
an address where he's staying?

16:04.806 --> 16:06.422
Uh-huh.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.807
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

16:07.809 --> 16:09.892
Please, no, don't...
don't tell him I called,

16:09.894 --> 16:12.111
because, uh,
that would ruin the surprise.

16:12.113 --> 16:15.147
Yeah, no, I, uh,
want to surprise him.

16:15.149 --> 16:17.316
Yeah, I have something
really big in store for him

16:17.318 --> 16:18.284
when I find him.

16:18.286 --> 16:22.204
Uh-huh.
Okay, thank you very much.

16:22.206 --> 16:23.789
That's some gullible mother.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.958
Yep, she probably would have
gave his information

16:25.960 --> 16:27.293
to a serial killer.

16:27.295 --> 16:28.995
He's staying at his
Uncle Mike's in Brooklyn.

16:28.997 --> 16:31.163
Let's go.

16:40.140 --> 16:42.041
Jana, I'm so glad to see you.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.343
Why was that man
taking my picture?

16:44.345 --> 16:46.095
That had nothing to do with you.

16:46.097 --> 16:48.180
You promised me
that if I testified

16:48.182 --> 16:49.649
I wouldn't be in the news.

16:49.651 --> 16:50.683
And you won't.

16:50.685 --> 16:51.967
Then what was he doing?

16:51.969 --> 16:53.969
He was harassing me.
That's all.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.187
Okay?

16:55.189 --> 16:58.658
Look, we've lost
a full day of preparation.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.693
Let's just press
the reset button...

17:00.695 --> 17:02.111
I don't think I can.

17:02.979 --> 17:04.280
Yes, you can.

17:04.281 --> 17:05.531
No.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.817
You were gonna ask me
all the gory details

17:08.819 --> 17:10.152
about what he did to me,

17:10.154 --> 17:12.488
then the other lawyer's gonna
do the exact same thing,

17:12.490 --> 17:14.089
only he's going to make it seem

17:14.092 --> 17:16.175
like I asked for it
or something.

17:17.627 --> 17:19.878
Honestly,
that's pretty damn close.

17:20.847 --> 17:23.832
The only thing
that you're leaving out

17:23.834 --> 17:27.353
hat 20 minutes
of your life--

17:27.355 --> 17:30.673
20 very uncomfortable minutes--

17:30.675 --> 17:34.310
and you can guarantee
that Mr. King goes to prison

17:34.312 --> 17:37.513
and is never allowed
around another minor again.

17:37.515 --> 17:41.183
There are no
guarantees anywhere.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.868
You want your life back.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.688
You want to spare others

17:45.690 --> 17:49.125
from ever having to go through
what you went through.

17:49.127 --> 17:50.209
20 minutes.

17:50.211 --> 17:51.744
That's all I'm asking for.

17:51.746 --> 17:54.997
It's not about the minutes.

17:58.335 --> 18:00.970
You got me the suit?

18:03.090 --> 18:07.176
Well, you said you didn't have
anything to wear to court.

18:09.563 --> 18:12.431
Ms. Reagan,
I'm sorry, but...

18:12.433 --> 18:15.434
no suit is going
to make a difference.

18:15.436 --> 18:16.986
No matter what I'm wearing,

18:16.988 --> 18:19.522
I will feel completely
naked in there.

18:19.524 --> 18:21.023
I'm sorry, but I just...
I can't.

18:21.025 --> 18:23.776
I-I-I can't do it.

18:23.778 --> 18:25.161
Jana.

18:25.163 --> 18:29.782
Please, just...

18:29.784 --> 18:32.451
leave me alone.

18:40.128 --> 18:42.261
<i>I think you must have</i>

18:42.263 --> 18:43.579
the wrong Dylan Sanders.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.080
Oh, well, you know,
we probably do,

18:45.082 --> 18:46.582
but, uh, we'd love
to chat with him

18:46.584 --> 18:47.583
just to make sure.

18:47.585 --> 18:48.751
You know,
clear things up.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.803
Are him and Sylvie
still staying here, by the way?

18:50.805 --> 18:52.688
Oh, yeah, yeah, they have
their own private section.

18:52.690 --> 18:53.856
I fixed it up
for them.

18:53.858 --> 18:55.274
What time do you
expect them home?

18:55.276 --> 18:56.475
Probably not till later.

18:56.477 --> 18:58.093
Uh, they went to a party.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.862
We're gonna need you
to stay here for a second.

18:59.864 --> 19:01.781
Officer, would you
keep him company, please?

19:03.900 --> 19:05.985
A party? They shot
a guy yesterday,

19:05.987 --> 19:07.319
and tonight they party?

19:07.321 --> 19:09.371
Well, that's what
crooks do, Baez,

19:09.373 --> 19:11.290
since time immemorial.

19:11.292 --> 19:13.492
I know, but...

19:13.494 --> 19:15.494
everybody we talked
to seemed to think

19:15.496 --> 19:17.112
that Sylvie had
a conscience.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.281
Well, maybe she does.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.454
Suitcases are packed, partner.

19:25.456 --> 19:28.624
As if ready to leave
on a moment's notice.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.975
Let's pull the uniforms
from out front, okay?

19:29.977 --> 19:31.927
And get the uncle out of here
in case there's gunplay.

19:31.929 --> 19:32.895
We're gonna be waiting for these

19:32.897 --> 19:34.096
sons of bitches
when they get home.

19:34.098 --> 19:36.315
I'm gonna call your BFFs
from the FBI.

19:36.317 --> 19:38.851
Why? So they can just jump
the gun and mess everything up?

19:38.853 --> 19:39.902
Don't even bother.

19:39.904 --> 19:40.969
That was the deal.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.606
Baez, you need to learn
to cut old ties.

19:43.608 --> 19:45.191
Would you forget the Feds?

19:46.026 --> 19:49.245
Valko sent me to voice mail.

19:49.247 --> 19:50.830
Screw 'em.

19:50.832 --> 19:52.248
Sounds like a plan.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.666
Look at this.

19:53.668 --> 19:55.868
Is that covered
under the warrant?

19:55.870 --> 19:59.088
Sure is. Look at that.

19:59.090 --> 20:00.489
Very Bonnie and Clyde.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.253
Yep.

20:01.278 --> 20:03.093
I'd like to wipe
the smirk off of his face.

20:03.094 --> 20:04.960
Mm-hmm. Is that
what I think it is?

20:04.962 --> 20:06.796
Yeah. Looks like
our cop's stolen Glock.

20:06.798 --> 20:08.330
Son of a bitch.
This is gonna be

20:08.332 --> 20:09.548
exhibit "A" at our trial.

20:09.550 --> 20:11.634
You know what,
let's tear this place apart.

20:11.636 --> 20:13.669
We got to find that gun.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.856
You got to stop making these
Holy Grail promises, Reagan.

20:16.858 --> 20:18.841
I mean, if you
do find it,

20:18.843 --> 20:20.226
you look like
a hero;

20:20.228 --> 20:22.061
if you don't, you
look like a total...

20:22.063 --> 20:23.729
Hey.
What, another picture?

20:23.731 --> 20:25.815
No. I think we got
a change of plans.

20:25.817 --> 20:27.483
I think they're gonna make
another hit tonight.

20:27.485 --> 20:29.401
Look at this.
How? All the banks are closed.

20:29.403 --> 20:32.037
Underground rave.
$30 cash at the door.

20:32.039 --> 20:34.073
They need cash if they
want to relocate, right?

20:34.075 --> 20:35.574
They're not
going to party.

20:35.576 --> 20:38.494
They're going to pull off
another heist. Come on.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.884
Mom, I think you
ought to see this.

20:44.886 --> 20:46.836
My friend Zeke sent me the link.

20:46.838 --> 20:49.872
I think I've had my quota
of cute kitty videos.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.040
No, Zeke wants
to be an anarchist.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.393
This is one of
the sites he monitors.

20:54.395 --> 20:55.895
Okay.

20:55.897 --> 20:58.264
It's called Citizens
for Police Accountability.

20:58.266 --> 21:00.149
Why would they have
your picture up?

21:00.151 --> 21:03.319
It's just some nutcase
who's decided your grandpa

21:03.321 --> 21:07.239
is trying to turn this city
into a totalitarian state.

21:07.241 --> 21:09.491
He's harassing all of us.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.698
There's a picture of Uncle Jamie
eating a donut.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.284
Yeah, a cop eating a donut;
that's news.

21:18.286 --> 21:22.070
One of Grandpa.
Mm-hmm.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.489
Who's she?

21:23.491 --> 21:25.958
I don't know.

21:28.545 --> 21:30.245
Hey, that's your friend Whitney.

21:30.247 --> 21:33.248
Yes, it is.

21:46.529 --> 21:48.564
There's a line.

21:48.566 --> 21:50.032
Yeah, and this
is a shield.

21:50.034 --> 21:52.234
You got a warrant?
No, we don't have a warrant,

21:52.236 --> 21:54.570
and if you're gonna waste our
time making us go get one,

21:54.572 --> 21:56.288
we're gonna come back,
search everyone in the club.

21:56.290 --> 21:58.574
If we find anyone underage,
guess what we're gonna do.

21:58.576 --> 21:59.708
We're gonna lock
your giant ass up.

21:59.710 --> 22:02.611
You got it?
You see these two tonight?

22:02.613 --> 22:04.630
Couldn't say.
Well, could you say

22:04.632 --> 22:05.965
if you knew
they're armed and dangerous?

22:05.967 --> 22:08.450
Do I look like I'd let someone
like that by me?

22:11.455 --> 22:13.389
Call in shots fired.
Okay.

22:13.391 --> 22:17.626
Central 10-13, I got shots fired
at 344 Flushing Ave.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.428
Police! Move it! Move it!

22:19.430 --> 22:21.096
Didn't anyone see
the shooter?

22:21.098 --> 22:22.798
Police! Move!
Can you see 'em?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.132
I can't see anything.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.235
The strobe lights are gonna
give me a freaking seizure.

22:26.237 --> 22:28.187
Hey, hey, you work here?
Yeah.

22:28.189 --> 22:29.638
What happened?
Somebody get shot? What?

22:29.640 --> 22:30.856
No, they got Polly,
my cashier.

22:30.858 --> 22:32.975
And the cash box. Like, 13 grand.
Slow down.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.244
What do you mean, they got
Polly? What are you saying?

22:35.246 --> 22:36.595
They took her with them.
That way.

22:36.597 --> 22:37.980
They shot the lock
off the back door

22:37.982 --> 22:39.865
to get out. They're gone!
Go. Move.

22:39.867 --> 22:42.418
Go! Clear it out!

22:42.420 --> 22:43.986
They scored a nice haul.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.537
Yeah, and a hostage.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.003
I know it's a nuisance, sure,
but Zachary Danhart

22:52.005 --> 22:53.704
and his group
didn't break any laws

22:53.706 --> 22:55.506
unless they published a picture
of your victim,

22:55.508 --> 22:57.108
which you say
they did not.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.509
No.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.912
They did post a picture of you.

23:00.914 --> 23:02.046
A few of them.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.015
Did they get my good side?

23:05.901 --> 23:09.687
They got you with
Whitney Robshaw at a restaurant.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.606
I see.

23:11.608 --> 23:14.225
I know it's none of my business.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.409
It is none of your business.

23:15.411 --> 23:19.080
Having said that,
what is going on?

23:20.867 --> 23:23.584
Well, believe it or not,
she's trying to forge

23:23.586 --> 23:26.921
a working relationship
between the ACLU and the NYPD.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.175
Being forged over dinner
at a nice restaurant.

23:31.177 --> 23:34.078
A drink at a place that, yes,
got an "A" rating

23:34.080 --> 23:35.963
from the health department.

23:36.798 --> 23:38.683
I wasn't born yesterday, Dad.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.601
I know exactly
when you were born,

23:40.603 --> 23:43.104
which is somewhere around
the time she was also born,

23:43.106 --> 23:44.605
if that's your point.

23:44.607 --> 23:48.092
Yeah. So seeing someone my age,
you think that's appropriate?

23:48.972 --> 23:50.438
Is she happily married?

23:50.440 --> 23:51.840
She's not married at all.

23:51.842 --> 23:53.324
Does she have a criminal record?

23:53.326 --> 23:55.643
Okay, you know what I mean.

23:55.645 --> 23:57.695
Yes, I do.

23:57.697 --> 24:00.448
So it's strictly business?

24:02.952 --> 24:06.621
You know, even I am
entitled to a little privacy.

24:07.823 --> 24:10.458
How... how would you like it
if I was dating

24:10.460 --> 24:12.010
one of Nicky's classmates?

24:12.012 --> 24:13.828
Not much.
I'd have to arrest you.

24:13.830 --> 24:16.598
Nicky's classmates
are only 16 years old.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.883
Dad, you're being
very difficult.

24:18.885 --> 24:21.836
And if you brought him
across state lines, I'd have

24:21.838 --> 24:23.855
to bring in the Feds.
Okay.

24:23.857 --> 24:25.173
Love you.

24:34.867 --> 24:36.201
Hey, you get my message?

24:36.203 --> 24:37.351
Yeah, I got your message.

24:37.353 --> 24:39.037
What the hell
are the Feds doing here?

24:39.039 --> 24:40.572
I called them.
We caught a break.

24:40.574 --> 24:42.123
You called them?
It's my case.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.209
You don't call anyone
unless I ask you to, okay?

24:44.211 --> 24:45.627
Let's go.

24:48.214 --> 24:51.199
Detective Reagan,
thanks for joining.

24:51.201 --> 24:52.333
You're welcome.

24:52.335 --> 24:53.835
This is Polly Wollman.

24:53.837 --> 24:56.171
Polly the hostage?

24:56.173 --> 24:58.006
How'd you escape?

24:58.008 --> 25:00.458
I didn't. They finally just
let me go, thank God.

25:00.460 --> 25:02.844
They took Ms. Wollman out
of the club at gunpoint

25:02.846 --> 25:05.180
and forced her to drive
them around in her car.

25:05.182 --> 25:07.098
Okay, how about you let her
speak for herself, okay?

25:07.100 --> 25:09.184
And you put an alarm
out on her car?

25:09.186 --> 25:10.151
They didn't take it.

25:10.153 --> 25:12.437
The guy wanted to,

25:12.439 --> 25:14.105
but the girl said
they don't steal

25:14.107 --> 25:15.857
from people, just...

25:15.859 --> 25:17.525
Just greedy corporations.
Right. We know their mantra.

25:17.527 --> 25:19.410
Do you have any idea
where they were heading?

25:19.412 --> 25:20.778
No.

25:20.780 --> 25:21.946
What else did they say?

25:21.948 --> 25:24.532
The girl said to tell you
that her boyfriend

25:24.534 --> 25:27.335
didn't mean to shoot
the man at the bank.

25:27.337 --> 25:29.671
She said to tell you
that was an accident.

25:29.673 --> 25:31.089
Did they hurt you?

25:31.091 --> 25:32.240
No.

25:32.242 --> 25:34.843
The guy threatened to,
but the girl--

25:34.845 --> 25:36.010
she seemed kind of

25:36.012 --> 25:37.879
protective of me.
She was nice.

25:37.881 --> 25:40.098
These are not nice people.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.217
They're armed thugs
who shot a man in cold blood.

25:42.219 --> 25:45.520
We need to find them
before he kills somebody.

25:45.522 --> 25:47.939
Give me one second.

25:50.676 --> 25:51.809
Officer Haskins, right?

25:51.811 --> 25:53.528
Yeah. Sorry to
bother you.

25:53.530 --> 25:54.562
That's all right.

25:54.564 --> 25:56.597
Let's go talk over here, okay?
Okay.

25:58.901 --> 26:00.601
What can I do
for you?

26:00.603 --> 26:02.904
I heard you raided the perps'
residence last night.

26:02.906 --> 26:04.239
A lot of evidence
was recovered?

26:04.241 --> 26:06.291
Yeah. Unfortunately,
we didn't find your gun.

26:06.293 --> 26:07.792
So they still have it?

26:07.794 --> 26:10.962
Yeah.
More people are gonna get hurt.

26:10.964 --> 26:13.882
Look, my off-duty gun
ended up in the wrong hands

26:13.884 --> 26:15.116
not long ago.

26:15.118 --> 26:16.918
And the guy did
some pretty serious damage.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.753
So I know how you feel.

26:18.755 --> 26:21.122
I promise you
I'll get it back to you, okay?

26:23.092 --> 26:27.595
Hey, there's no report
on the guy that got shot?

26:27.597 --> 26:29.314
I want to apologize
and see him,

26:29.316 --> 26:30.682
but I can't face him.

26:30.684 --> 26:32.984
If he dies...
Well, look, he's in great hands.

26:32.986 --> 26:34.969
He's at St. Vic's.
They got great people there.

26:34.971 --> 26:35.987
My wife works there.

26:35.989 --> 26:37.155
Is she taking care of him?

26:37.157 --> 26:38.406
No, she works
in the E.R.

26:38.408 --> 26:40.275
But I tell you what,
I'll give her a call,

26:40.277 --> 26:42.026
and I'll have her check up
on him, okay?

26:42.028 --> 26:43.811
I appreciate that.

26:43.813 --> 26:45.646
Look, I know you're in a jam.

26:45.648 --> 26:48.482
All I can tell you
is hang in there.

26:48.484 --> 26:50.118
I'm doing all I can.

26:51.620 --> 26:53.504
All right.

26:58.727 --> 27:00.661
I just wanted to
check on the status

27:00.663 --> 27:02.680
of one of your patients--
a Kenneth Harrington.

27:02.682 --> 27:05.300
You know, he's the GSW
from the bank shooting.

27:05.302 --> 27:07.769
Yeah. He's got
a little post-op infection,

27:07.771 --> 27:09.687
but the nephrectomy
was successful.

27:09.689 --> 27:11.673
Wow. He lost
a kidney, huh?

27:11.675 --> 27:13.057
The other one's healthy.
Huh.

27:13.059 --> 27:14.675
Plenty of people
do just fine

27:14.677 --> 27:16.194
with one, you know?
Yeah.

27:16.196 --> 27:18.229
Oh. Sorry.

27:18.231 --> 27:21.065
I've got a
hiatal hernia calling.

27:21.067 --> 27:23.284
Well, have fun. Thanks.

27:26.121 --> 27:27.622
Excuse me.

27:27.624 --> 27:29.190
Yeah?

27:29.192 --> 27:32.526
Can you tell me if Kenneth
Harrington's gonna be okay?

27:32.528 --> 27:34.545
Are you a relative?

27:34.547 --> 27:36.664
Oh, um, I don't...
I don't need to see him.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.967
I just... I-I saw on the news

27:38.969 --> 27:40.551
that he was
in critical condition.

27:40.553 --> 27:43.171
And I-I tried calling
on the phones earlier,

27:43.173 --> 27:45.590
but nobody was really
telling me anything, so...

27:45.592 --> 27:47.425
is he gonna pull through?

27:47.427 --> 27:49.927
You know, I-I...
I don't work on this floor.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.647
But if you give me a second,
I'll go check

27:52.649 --> 27:55.549
and find somebody
who can help you out, okay?

27:55.551 --> 27:56.851
Um, okay.

28:15.337 --> 28:17.205
Security?

28:20.342 --> 28:22.927
So how'd you get yourself
mixed up in this thing, huh?

28:23.912 --> 28:25.963
You do understand
that you could've gotten

28:25.965 --> 28:27.048
yourself killed, right?

28:27.050 --> 28:30.385
The global economy is collapsing

28:30.387 --> 28:32.020
because of the banks' greed
and corruption.

28:32.022 --> 28:34.772
But not a single CEO
has gone to jail.

28:34.774 --> 28:36.941
The only punishment
that they're receiving

28:36.943 --> 28:38.693
are multimillion-dollar bonuses.

28:38.695 --> 28:42.096
Right. And Dylan filled your
head with all this stuff, right?

28:42.098 --> 28:44.148
It's all true.

28:44.150 --> 28:46.484
Mmm.

28:46.486 --> 28:47.952
What, you don't think

28:47.954 --> 28:49.821
that they should be punished
for their crimes?

28:49.823 --> 28:52.907
I think those scumbags
should be punished

28:52.909 --> 28:55.243
for all their
crimes, absolutely.

28:55.245 --> 28:59.464
But don't you think that you and
Dylan should be punished, too?

28:59.466 --> 29:00.948
I mean, for your crimes?

29:00.950 --> 29:02.717
Hmm?

29:02.719 --> 29:05.670
I mean, I notice you kept
all the money you stole.

29:07.556 --> 29:09.557
You didn't give it back
to the banks' victims.

29:09.559 --> 29:11.792
We were making a statement.

29:11.794 --> 29:14.262
We were highlighting
the banks' crimes.

29:14.264 --> 29:17.298
Mm-hmm. And the rave
that you guys ripped off,

29:17.300 --> 29:18.683
what was your moral stand there?

29:18.685 --> 29:22.854
Dylan found out that the record
company throwing the rave,

29:22.856 --> 29:24.972
QMQ, is fully owned
by the larger conglom...

29:24.974 --> 29:26.991
Sylvie, stop. Stop! Stop it!

29:29.194 --> 29:32.914
Look, don't you see that this
guy's manipulating you?

29:32.916 --> 29:34.415
Huh?

29:34.417 --> 29:35.950
He's not. He saved me.

29:35.952 --> 29:38.152
Well, he's not here
to save you now, is he?

29:38.154 --> 29:40.204
And you know why?

29:40.206 --> 29:42.874
Because he doesn't care
about you, Sylvie.

29:42.876 --> 29:44.992
Okay? Look, I get it.

29:44.994 --> 29:46.427
You're in love with the guy.

29:46.429 --> 29:47.628
I understand.

29:47.630 --> 29:49.514
And you can't see
what he's doing.

29:49.516 --> 29:53.667
But... hey, look at what
he's gotten you into.

29:53.669 --> 29:56.137
Robbing banks?
Attempted murder?

29:56.139 --> 29:57.688
No, no, that was an accident.

29:57.690 --> 30:00.057
It wasn't an accident.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.342
He's a bad guy.

30:01.344 --> 30:03.677
He's a bad guy, and
he's ruined your life.

30:03.679 --> 30:05.863
What life?!

30:07.032 --> 30:11.619
Okay, I-I have done everything
I was supposed to do,

30:11.621 --> 30:14.956
and I have nothing!

30:14.958 --> 30:18.042
I studied, went to college,
and for what?

30:18.044 --> 30:19.127
Zero options.

30:19.129 --> 30:22.163
You had options,
and you have options now.

30:22.165 --> 30:23.864
And let me tell you something.

30:23.866 --> 30:26.501
You're gonna take the option
that's right in front of you.

30:26.503 --> 30:27.868
You're gonna help me help you

30:27.870 --> 30:30.138
and tell me
where I can find find Dylan.

30:31.974 --> 30:34.041
Look who's trying
to manipulate me now.

30:34.043 --> 30:36.010
Okay.

30:36.012 --> 30:38.729
Look, if you don't want
to do it to save yourself,

30:38.731 --> 30:40.731
do it to save your boyfriend.

30:41.550 --> 30:42.733
Because the real
Bonnie and Clyde,

30:42.735 --> 30:44.852
ow
how that story ends, right?

30:47.389 --> 30:49.106
Yeah, you do.

30:49.108 --> 30:52.393
Cops put 150 rounds into them.

30:52.395 --> 30:56.730
Trust me, you want it
to be me who finds Dylan,

30:56.732 --> 30:58.416
not some other cop.

30:58.418 --> 31:00.618
You understand what
I'm telling you?

31:03.905 --> 31:06.907
Oh, my God.

31:06.909 --> 31:08.459
Tell me where I can find him.

31:13.216 --> 31:14.582
Detective Reagan.

31:14.584 --> 31:15.916
I'm a little busy right now.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.635
It looks like you
could use a break.

31:25.310 --> 31:27.228
What the hell are you doing?

31:27.230 --> 31:28.729
Me? You're the one
who's out of line here.

31:28.731 --> 31:30.431
You do not come into my house
and interrupt my interrogation.

31:30.433 --> 31:32.066
We had a deal.
In the history of bad timing...

31:32.068 --> 31:33.934
You were supposed to notify us
in the event of an arrest.

31:33.936 --> 31:35.453
And she's about to tell me
where the kid is!

31:35.455 --> 31:37.405
You cut me out now,

31:37.407 --> 31:40.625
I will get her writ over
to the federal system.

31:44.580 --> 31:47.915
Ms. Freeland, I'm Special Agent
Emily Valko with the FBI.

31:47.917 --> 31:49.950
I'm sure Detective Reagan
has covered this,

31:49.952 --> 31:53.120
but I would like to remind
you of your Miranda rights.

31:53.122 --> 31:55.022
You have a right to remain silent...
Yes.

31:55.024 --> 31:56.757
Excuse me?

31:56.759 --> 31:58.726
I would like
to assert that right.

31:58.728 --> 32:01.512
And I want
an attorney.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.151
Nice work.

32:28.290 --> 32:29.874
What's up with you?

32:29.876 --> 32:31.992
Get over here.

32:31.994 --> 32:33.661
Where's Dad?

32:33.663 --> 32:35.246
I don't know.

32:35.248 --> 32:36.681
Why are we whispering?

32:36.683 --> 32:39.384
Do you know
who Whitney Robshaw is?

32:39.386 --> 32:41.552
That friend of yours,
the hot ACLU attorney?

32:43.773 --> 32:45.106
Yeah.

32:45.108 --> 32:47.174
It's not confirmed yet,

32:47.176 --> 32:50.728
but there's a slim possibility
that Dad is...

32:50.730 --> 32:51.863
dating her.

32:52.949 --> 32:54.198
I mean, so?

32:54.200 --> 32:56.684
What do you mean, "so?"

32:56.686 --> 32:58.619
You can't possibly approve
of that.

32:58.621 --> 33:01.038
Dad doesn't need my approval
or yours.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.741
Jamie, this is not a good match.

33:03.743 --> 33:04.742
Why not?

33:04.744 --> 33:06.193
What? What do you mean,
"why not?"

33:06.195 --> 33:08.129
It just... It's not, okay?

33:08.131 --> 33:09.380
It's just not.

33:09.382 --> 33:11.048
Do you realize
how long it's been

33:11.050 --> 33:12.800
since Mom passed?
Okay, don't use Mom

33:12.802 --> 33:14.869
and Whitney in
the same lifetime.

33:14.871 --> 33:16.370
I'm gonna go watch the game.

33:16.372 --> 33:19.373
Watch you don't get a finger
in the salad.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.988
Honey?
Yeah?

33:35.190 --> 33:36.524
You're going at your food

33:36.526 --> 33:37.909
like it's trying to escape.

33:37.911 --> 33:39.444
You break it, you bought it.

33:39.446 --> 33:41.279
I'm sorry, okay?

33:41.281 --> 33:44.064
Just had a case go south
thanks to the FBI.

33:44.066 --> 33:45.733
Oh, I've been there.

33:45.735 --> 33:48.085
And Officer Haskins' gun
is still missing.

33:48.087 --> 33:50.755
Do you know every detail
about every case

33:50.757 --> 33:53.207
in all 76 of your precincts,
Dad?

33:53.209 --> 33:55.259
And all 12 transit districts.

33:55.261 --> 33:57.411
Plus the nine housing PSAs.

33:57.413 --> 33:59.263
Well, yes,
his gun's still missing,

33:59.265 --> 34:01.682
and I know how it feels
to not know whose hand

34:01.684 --> 34:03.584
you weapon is in,
so I feel for the guy.

34:03.586 --> 34:05.419
Word on Haskins is,
if it weren't for bad luck,

34:05.421 --> 34:06.771
he wouldn't have
any luck at all.

34:06.773 --> 34:08.422
Well, hopefully
I'll change that.

34:08.424 --> 34:10.925
Is this about that
Bonnie and Clyde case?

34:10.927 --> 34:12.109
Please don't call it that.

34:12.110 --> 34:13.527
It romanticizes it.

34:13.530 --> 34:15.897
I didn't call them
that; the papers did,

34:15.899 --> 34:17.732
and they are
kind of romantic.

34:17.734 --> 34:18.733
Ugh.

34:18.735 --> 34:21.068
Criminals are not romantic.

34:21.070 --> 34:23.120
No, they're not.
Not in real life.

34:23.121 --> 34:25.039
Look, I'm not condoning
their crime.

34:25.041 --> 34:26.290
Well, that's a relief.

34:26.292 --> 34:28.326
But there is the whole...

34:28.328 --> 34:31.496
young couple in love raging
against the system thing.

34:31.498 --> 34:32.663
Yeah, you kind of don't really

34:32.665 --> 34:34.081
want to believe that,
though, Nicky.

34:34.083 --> 34:36.283
It's just crap they make up
for the newspapers.

34:36.284 --> 34:37.784
Yeah, the Citizens
for Police Accountability.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.286
It's the same scam.

34:39.288 --> 34:40.588
Tell me about it.

34:40.590 --> 34:42.005
They act like they're
providing honest information,

34:42.007 --> 34:44.458
but it's just a way to get
more eyeballs to their Web site.

34:44.460 --> 34:46.561
I mean, come on, ever
since I came on the job,

34:46.563 --> 34:48.563
there's been a citizen taking
a photo or a video

34:48.565 --> 34:49.897
of every collar I've ever made.

34:49.899 --> 34:51.681
What is the Citizens
Against Police...

34:51.684 --> 34:53.150
It's just some creep

34:53.152 --> 34:55.069
who thinks Dad
has become Big Brother,

34:55.071 --> 34:56.320
so he's harassing us,

34:56.322 --> 34:57.989
taking our pictures,
posting them.

34:57.991 --> 34:59.657
I'm surprised
they haven't gotten to you yet.

34:59.659 --> 35:00.741
Why? They got you?

35:00.743 --> 35:05.112
Yeah, and Jamie and... Dad.

35:07.950 --> 35:09.096
And what'd they
get you doing, Dad?

35:09.121 --> 35:10.085
Nothing.

35:10.086 --> 35:12.152
Nothing.

35:12.154 --> 35:14.255
Except for going to dinner
with a woman.

35:14.257 --> 35:15.206
A drink.

35:15.208 --> 35:16.958
Okay.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.159
Are we all

35:19.161 --> 35:20.211
missing something here?

35:20.213 --> 35:21.546
All right, that's it.

35:22.297 --> 35:23.631
I confess.

35:23.633 --> 35:26.934
I got caught red-handed
having a drink with a woman.

35:26.936 --> 35:28.502
A woman?
Just... just any woman?

35:28.504 --> 35:31.022
A friend of Erin's.
Her name is Whitney.

35:31.024 --> 35:32.273
She has an Australian accent.

35:32.275 --> 35:33.891
The hot blonde with the cane?

35:33.893 --> 35:34.892
Are you kidding me?

35:34.894 --> 35:36.777
I don't know what got into me.

35:36.779 --> 35:38.613
I know I'm no spring chicken,

35:38.615 --> 35:40.648
but I'm pretty sure
I'm not dead.

35:40.650 --> 35:42.349
And that's all there is to that.

35:42.351 --> 35:43.517
Yeah, for now.

35:43.519 --> 35:44.685
Mom.

35:44.687 --> 35:45.786
Mom.

35:45.788 --> 35:48.239
Erin, come on.

35:48.241 --> 35:52.460
Somebody please pass me
something that's bad for me.

35:53.579 --> 35:55.830
Jana, it's Erin Reagan.

35:55.832 --> 35:57.364
It's 8:50 Monday morning.

35:57.366 --> 35:59.166
The trial's about to reconvene.

35:59.168 --> 36:01.502
Can you please call me back...?

36:01.504 --> 36:02.870
Hey, you.

36:02.872 --> 36:04.371
Come here.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.390
You want to do some real good?

36:06.392 --> 36:08.259
If you touch my camera,
I'm calling a cop.

36:08.261 --> 36:10.227
Why don't you sneak your camera
into the courthouse?

36:10.229 --> 36:12.046
Part 35, fourth floor.

36:12.048 --> 36:13.814
Take a picture of the defendant.

36:13.816 --> 36:14.849
Put that out there.

36:14.851 --> 36:15.983
Why would I do that?

36:15.985 --> 36:18.903
Because he's a child molester
who may walk

36:18.905 --> 36:22.273
because your idiotic crusade
scared off the main witness.

36:22.275 --> 36:24.275
Yeah, well,

36:24.277 --> 36:26.560
not everybody does
the Reagan bidding.

36:26.562 --> 36:28.245
Really? That's all you have?

36:28.247 --> 36:29.697
Miss Reagan?

36:30.832 --> 36:33.618
You try taking
my picture again,

36:33.620 --> 36:34.835
I will shove that camera...

36:34.837 --> 36:36.287
Hey, he won't.

36:36.289 --> 36:37.755
Am I right?

36:37.757 --> 36:40.424
I'm not done with you
or your family.

36:40.426 --> 36:41.759
Fine.

36:41.761 --> 36:43.427
Just leave her out of it.

36:53.438 --> 36:54.855
I look okay?

36:54.857 --> 36:57.108
You look great.

36:57.110 --> 36:59.610
I feel like a wreck.

37:00.445 --> 37:02.446
Well, who wouldn't?

37:02.448 --> 37:04.765
Thank you for being here.

37:04.767 --> 37:07.234
I'll do the best I can.

37:07.236 --> 37:10.955
I think your best
is gonna be pretty damn great.

37:22.450 --> 37:25.169
Hey, grab your Kevlar.
Why?

37:25.171 --> 37:27.388
Those FBI sons of bitches
cut us out of the loop.

37:27.390 --> 37:28.973
Dylan's on the run.

37:28.975 --> 37:30.791
This is me not saying
"I told you so."

37:30.793 --> 37:32.626
They were closing in on Dylan;
he got away.

37:32.628 --> 37:34.762
He just jacked a car,
but we have the GPS.

37:34.764 --> 37:35.963
Great.

37:35.965 --> 37:37.481
I'm driving,

37:37.483 --> 37:39.984
and you're gonna want
to buckle up.

37:48.827 --> 37:50.861
Target's heading
north on Vernon Boulevard

37:50.863 --> 37:52.113
at a high rate of speed.

37:52.115 --> 37:53.313
Subject is armed and dangerous.

37:53.315 --> 37:55.199
Copy that, Central.
There he is.

38:01.006 --> 38:01.972
Hang on.

38:21.509 --> 38:24.311
Freeze!

38:24.313 --> 38:25.863
Drop the weapon!

38:25.865 --> 38:27.364
Drop it!

38:27.366 --> 38:28.866
Don't move!

38:31.036 --> 38:33.571
Dylan, I want you to toss
that gun out right now.

38:33.573 --> 38:35.873
Yeah, okay, you guys first.

38:35.875 --> 38:37.825
It's not gonna happen.

38:37.827 --> 38:40.461
Look, kid, you're a
little outnumbered here.

38:40.463 --> 38:43.414
Hey, look at me!

38:43.416 --> 38:45.299
I'm Detective Reagan.

38:45.301 --> 38:47.051
That supposed
to mean something to me?

38:47.053 --> 38:48.368
Yeah.

38:48.370 --> 38:50.471
I'm the one
that arrested Sylvie.

38:51.506 --> 38:53.808
We had a nice,
long chat about you.

38:55.644 --> 38:56.977
She give me up?

38:56.979 --> 38:58.262
No.

38:58.264 --> 39:00.181
Not even to save herself, kid.

39:00.183 --> 39:03.383
But she asked me to promise
to bring you in safe, Dylan.

39:03.385 --> 39:05.102
You owe her that.

39:06.321 --> 39:08.022
We know what's
going on here.

39:08.024 --> 39:09.490
The guy you shot, he survived.

39:09.492 --> 39:10.608
He's okay.

39:10.610 --> 39:12.392
And everybody knows
it was an accident,

39:12.394 --> 39:14.745
all right, so why don't you
just toss that gun out,

39:14.747 --> 39:16.614
and let's end this peacefully,
all right?

39:19.034 --> 39:21.786
I'm not giving up here,
Detective.

39:21.788 --> 39:23.838
I'm not either, kid.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.384
Suspect down.

39:48.146 --> 39:49.747
Reagan...

39:49.749 --> 39:53.317
There's nothing to say.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.904
You gave him
every possible chance.

40:03.111 --> 40:04.328
I know.

40:04.330 --> 40:06.330
We got the gun.

40:06.332 --> 40:08.415
Yeah, we got the gun.

40:08.417 --> 40:09.500
You got what you wanted.

40:09.502 --> 40:10.584
I didn't get what I wanted.

40:10.586 --> 40:12.336
The only one who got
what he wanted was him.

40:12.338 --> 40:13.337
How's that?

40:13.339 --> 40:15.389
He wanted
a Bonnie and Clyde ending.

40:15.391 --> 40:17.391
He got it, all right.

40:22.347 --> 40:24.565
And they're guaranteed
to be on your desk

40:24.567 --> 40:26.066
by first thing in the morning.

40:26.068 --> 40:28.102
We're supposed
to have the back room.

40:28.104 --> 40:29.653
Looks like the monsignors

40:29.655 --> 40:31.238
have all beaten us here.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.107
Give me a minute,
will you, Garrett?

40:33.109 --> 40:35.075
Frank?

40:35.077 --> 40:36.744
Garrett?

40:36.746 --> 40:38.946
Gotcha.

40:38.948 --> 40:42.283
Hello, Frank.

40:42.285 --> 40:43.500
Hello, Whitney.

40:43.502 --> 40:46.003
Did you get my message?

40:46.005 --> 40:47.872
I did.

40:48.924 --> 40:51.675
But I was already warned
about the photographs.

40:51.677 --> 40:52.676
Oh.

40:52.678 --> 40:54.128
Well, I imagine the PC

40:54.130 --> 40:55.512
has eyes and
ears everywhere.

40:55.514 --> 40:57.348
Yeah, I'm the
police commissioner.

40:57.350 --> 40:59.133
I know everything.

40:59.135 --> 41:00.834
Actually, Erin told me.

41:00.836 --> 41:03.053
Oh.

41:03.055 --> 41:04.772
She had questions?

41:06.058 --> 41:07.841
Yes, she did.

41:07.843 --> 41:09.643
What'd you say?

41:09.645 --> 41:11.729
Well, there's not much to say.

41:11.731 --> 41:13.680
Two people
with a fair amount to discuss

41:13.682 --> 41:15.366
had a drink together.

41:15.368 --> 41:16.901
I'm told that happens
all the time.

41:16.903 --> 41:19.403
I think you're right.

41:19.405 --> 41:21.655
But...

41:21.657 --> 41:23.357
They could meet
for another drink,

41:23.359 --> 41:24.858
it could turn into dinner...

41:24.860 --> 41:27.711
And that could lead
to something else,

41:27.713 --> 41:30.197
and I don't think this can.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.032
Not that you asked.

41:34.252 --> 41:35.753
Erin's a lucky woman.

41:36.671 --> 41:37.972
How's that?

41:37.974 --> 41:40.724
She has a father
who holds her opinion so dearly.

41:40.726 --> 41:42.209
Don't lawyer me, Whitney.

41:42.211 --> 41:43.477
How is that lawyering you?

41:43.479 --> 41:46.814
By framing this
as if I'm doing Erin's bidding.

41:48.851 --> 41:50.401
Okay.

41:50.403 --> 41:51.885
Score one for the chief.

41:51.887 --> 41:54.054
But give me one good reason

41:54.056 --> 41:57.608
why we shouldn't see
where this might go.

41:58.410 --> 42:00.661
Besides you and Erin
being friends?

42:03.564 --> 42:07.234
Our ideological differences,
my public profile, your job.

42:07.236 --> 42:09.420
Give me ten good reasons.

42:11.456 --> 42:14.341
I don't have ten.

42:17.462 --> 42:20.130
I'll be right there.

42:20.966 --> 42:22.716
You have a luncheon?

42:22.718 --> 42:24.134
Yeah, colleagues.

42:24.136 --> 42:25.803
And I have
the monsignors waiting.

42:25.805 --> 42:30.024
Oh, better not keep
the monsignors waiting.

42:31.860 --> 42:32.977
Anyway.

42:32.979 --> 42:35.429
I understand.

42:37.817 --> 42:39.433
So?

42:39.435 --> 42:43.487
It's always really good
to see you, Frank.
