08:51.791 --> 08:53.541
-Okay. I'm here if you need me.
-Thanks.

08:53.625 --> 08:54.375
Come on.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.375
I'll do the story, I promise.
I just... I need to talk first.

08:59.458 --> 09:02.083
About Audrey?
Girl needs to set an intention

09:02.166 --> 09:04.250
with some crystals, stat.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.833
About how we take all this
to the next level.

09:06.916 --> 09:07.916
I wanna show my dad
that I'm serious.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.083
That my brand can be a real
and lucrative career.

09:12.166 --> 09:13.250
Do you know how long
I've waited for this?

09:13.333 --> 09:16.041
For you to go from content
to creator,

09:16.125 --> 09:18.250
icon to iconoclast?

09:18.333 --> 09:19.333
I don't know about that, but...

09:19.416 --> 09:21.708
The trends you create,
they're now,

09:21.791 --> 09:22.750
but if you want
a lifelong career,

09:22.833 --> 09:25.375
we need to remove you
from the concept of time.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.583
Forget influence,
you need importance,

09:26.666 --> 09:30.208
which takes more than
daily displays of good taste.

09:30.291 --> 09:32.291
A great Rihanna banger
is of its moment.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.791
Fenty is forever.

09:35.791 --> 09:37.958
So I need to launch
my own line?

09:38.041 --> 09:40.625
Oh, God, no. You're barely ready
to launch a zine.

09:40.708 --> 09:43.916
Ultimately, yes, but first,
you need to test the waters.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.625
Prove the depths
you can swim in.

09:45.708 --> 09:49.500
Which means a collab.
I'll make some calls.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.458
-Keep tonight open.
-Okay.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.125

09:58.208 --> 09:59.916

Is one of those for me?

10:02.416 --> 10:03.500
Finally caught you.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.291
If you want me to chase again,
just let me know.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.166
Is that the line you use
on all the boys?

10:08.250 --> 10:10.125
So that's what this is about?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.125
The fact that
I occasionally sleep

10:11.208 --> 10:13.458
with a senior or two?

10:13.541 --> 10:14.708
All this coming
from a 17-year-old

10:14.791 --> 10:19.125
for whom ringside at the Knicks
takes on a whole other meaning?

10:19.208 --> 10:21.791
-That's not the same.
-You're right.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.083
You're different than them.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.375
You aren't a conquest.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.333
You're a fellow conquistador.

10:27.416 --> 10:31.083
Consider me colonized
and move on.

10:31.166 --> 10:32.666
I'm not gonna fuck you again.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.833
And if I see you cozy up
to another student,

10:34.916 --> 10:35.500
I'll make sure
that they don't either.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.791
Yes, and please make sure
to give my mother her drip

10:40.875 --> 10:43.625
before flirting with the EMT
that looks like Oscar Isaac.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.750
She stands no chance.
Do not put me on hold. I--

10:45.833 --> 10:47.833
I swear to God, if you put me
on hold right now--

10:47.916 --> 10:50.000
Hello? Hell--

10:50.625 --> 10:51.125
(SCREAMS)

10:51.208 --> 10:52.708
What? Can I help you?

10:52.791 --> 10:55.833
I just wanted to say I hope
your mom's feeling better.

10:55.916 --> 10:59.291
-And if you need anything--
-It won't be from you. So...

10:59.375 --> 11:01.333
Look, I can't imagine
how you must feel right now,

11:01.416 --> 11:03.750
but, um, sometimes, when
you're feeling overwhelmed,

11:03.833 --> 11:05.958
it helps to take a deep breath
and imagine you're--

11:06.041 --> 11:07.083
Watching your supposed boyfriend
have better chemistry

11:07.166 --> 11:08.208
with your sister?

11:08.291 --> 11:10.208
That calms me down every time.

11:10.291 --> 11:11.541
Hmm. It's working for me too.

11:11.625 --> 11:14.208
NURSE: (OVER PHONE)<i> Hello?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

11:14.291 --> 11:16.041
AUDREY HOPE:
Yes, I am still here.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.875
So maybe it's...

11:17.958 --> 11:19.958
the kick in the ass
that I needed to start thinking

11:20.041 --> 11:22.708
about the bigger picture
and not just how I look in it.

11:22.791 --> 11:23.625
I want to invest in my future.

11:23.708 --> 11:27.333
Did you just say "invest"
and "in future"?

11:27.416 --> 11:28.750
When we were dating,
I couldn't even get you

11:28.833 --> 11:30.250
to decide on a restaurant,
like, an hour in advance.

11:30.333 --> 11:31.583
I'm growing. (CHUCKLES)

11:33.708 --> 11:33.791
I've noticed.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.958
So I can do
what I've always done

11:38.041 --> 11:40.208
and just live
and expect people to care,

11:40.291 --> 11:43.916
or I can push myself
outside of my comfort zone

11:44.000 --> 11:46.416
and figure out if there's a way
that I can use my platform

11:46.500 --> 11:49.541
to create something
that people actually need.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.875

Oh, just new Julien's

11:57.458 --> 11:59.583
Genius? Big word for 8:00 a.m.

11:59.666 --> 12:02.583
It's not. He's just trying
to make me feel better.

12:02.666 --> 12:04.416
I'm sure whatever it is,
it's amazing,

12:04.500 --> 12:06.875
and I can't wait to hear
all about it, but, um,

12:06.958 --> 12:08.583
first, when do I get
to meet your mom?

12:08.666 --> 12:11.416
-Helena's in town?
-Yeah, uh, she is, yeah.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.791
She just got in this morning.

12:13.875 --> 12:14.625
Yeah. Gossip Girl
was all over it.

12:14.708 --> 12:17.208
I don't know.
She didn't even, like,

12:17.291 --> 12:19.583
tell me that she was coming.
She's just--

12:19.666 --> 12:22.250
I don't know. She's here
to check up on the development
in the Navy Yard,

12:22.333 --> 12:23.041
and then she's gonna
have dinner with Aki's dad,

12:23.125 --> 12:25.166
and then she's out.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.750

I'm gonna see her, really.

flirting attempts alone?

12:35.666 --> 12:37.541
Uh, I would, yeah, but it's--
it's ball tryouts today,

12:37.625 --> 12:38.500
so I'm probably just gonna have
to go home after

-Good luck.

his mom's in town?

Things have just been so off
since the Simon thing.

12:53.625 --> 12:54.791

discussed that.

that's not personal.

12:57.583 --> 13:00.333
That's about him.
He's her golden boy,

13:00.416 --> 13:02.708

he's totally terrified of her.

but when it comes to her,
he just freezes.

I had to track her down

13:12.333 --> 13:14.708

because he was too nervous.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.083
-(ELEVATOR DINGS)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

18:00.166 --> 18:03.291
I wasn't aware this was
a bring-your-dad-to-work event.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.916
Well, this is
all about collaboration, right?

18:05.041 --> 18:07.166
That's what he does
for a living,

18:07.250 --> 18:08.791
so I value his opinion.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.666
The L'Oréal, Glossier,
and Goop reps are at the bar

18:11.750 --> 18:13.500
for an exclusive pre-drink.

18:13.583 --> 18:14.791
Then they'll move
to the seating area

18:14.875 --> 18:16.416
-when the rest arrive.
-The rest?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.250
How many reps
did you get in a few hours?

18:18.333 --> 18:20.416
Do you not know how important
your daughter is?

18:20.750 --> 18:22.083
Come on.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.625
Where's our future
Pulitzer winner?

18:25.708 --> 18:27.125
Snuck off to make a call.
It's for the best.

18:27.208 --> 18:30.458
I already got through twice
the material I had planned.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.958
She's a quick one.
I wish I had that.

18:33.041 --> 18:35.041
It would've made law school
way easier.

18:37.291 --> 18:39.125
-She take after her mom there?
-Try carbon copy.

18:42.708 --> 18:46.083
-I don't mean to pry.
-I love talking about Marion.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.250
Keeps me from forgetting.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.083
-How did you two meet?
-We went to school together.

18:51.458 --> 18:52.458
PS '87.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.291
She was so confident.

18:56.375 --> 18:59.458
Completely just comfortable
with herself.

18:59.541 --> 19:00.541
Like you-know-who over there.

19:00.625 --> 19:03.916
College separated us,
but we never really lost touch.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.291
I didn't realize you'd known
each other that long.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.791
Most of my life,
up until the day she died.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.416
Um, you don't have to tell me.
(CHUCKLES)

19:11.500 --> 19:13.000
NICK LOTT: No, I don't mind.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.583
You know, you're really easy
to talk to.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.916
Maybe we can go
to dinner sometime.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.500
Just us. Talk some more.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.666
Not sure that dress
goes with sloppy joes.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.208
Uh, Obie invited me
to go to a fancy dinner

19:26.291 --> 19:27.666
to meet his mom.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.000
Can I go?

19:30.083 --> 19:32.291
Kate and I already covered
a lot of ground.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.208
Yes, you can.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.250
But only if I can get
a picture with you first.

19:38.333 --> 19:38.666
Ugh, Dad.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.625
-Please?
-No.

19:39.708 --> 19:41.750
-Just one.
-Uh-uh.

19:44.833 --> 19:45.875

You're just in time
for this evening's show.

19:57.708 --> 20:00.041
Do you know the temperature
in my mother's room right now?

20:00.125 --> 20:02.083
It is 67 degrees.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.791
That might be
the proper temperature

20:03.875 --> 20:06.333
for bedrooms according to
the National Sleep Foundation,

20:06.416 --> 20:08.083
but for the hospital room
of a woman

20:08.166 --> 20:11.166
with a weakened immune system,
it's downright deplorable.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.375
How are you gonna fix it?
Go. Turn it up.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.833
Go turn it up. Oh, my God.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.416

have dinner tonight with my dad.

You can expect a lot less
until you clear this up.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.500
Hooking up is the last thing
on my mind right now.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.291
But I'd better handle it

but I don't think I'm gonna
get her to leave.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.500
You have to.
We're getting complaints,

21:17.583 --> 21:19.958
and not just the staff,
patients too.

21:20.041 --> 21:22.333
She can come back tomorrow
during visiting hours.

until about an hour ago.

In Europe, we dress for dinner.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.000

in the hospital, Mama,

23:01.583 --> 23:04.041

what happened.

23:04.125 --> 23:07.291
I had no idea that your mother
was struggling so.

23:07.375 --> 23:10.500
Even though your papers reported
in great detail

23:10.583 --> 23:13.625
about the failure
of her company almost daily?

23:13.708 --> 23:16.333
I may own the papers,
but I don't believe in

23:16.416 --> 23:19.833
preventing journalists
from doing their jobs.

23:19.916 --> 23:24.375
However, I'm personally sorry
that it all went so public.

23:24.458 --> 23:25.250
-Me too.
-ROGER: Hmm.

23:26.250 --> 23:29.333
Well, you needn't have worried,
Ms. Lott.

23:29.416 --> 23:30.625
I know you're new here,

23:30.708 --> 23:32.250
but you'll soon see
that we're all very close.

23:32.333 --> 23:35.291
I mean, Helena and I
have known each other

23:35.375 --> 23:37.458
since before our sons were born.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.416
Jody and I were married
for a decade.

23:39.500 --> 23:43.250
So none of us have got
any secrets here.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.250
The settlement
made sure of that.

at least two tutorials a day

23:54.458 --> 23:56.375

based on our analytics,

23:56.458 --> 23:57.416
which we would shoot in advance,

23:57.500 --> 24:00.125
as we're respectful
of your school schedule.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.958
My brand

24:02.041 --> 24:02.958
I don't do pre-shoots.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.791
I upload the moment we post.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.375
An honest and free spirit
like yourself

24:07.458 --> 24:10.916
might benefit more
from our company's philosophy.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.958
We're all about what's natural.

24:13.041 --> 24:15.458
We do some light retouching,
teeth whitening, flyaways,

24:15.541 --> 24:19.541
nothing you wouldn't want.
What are your priorities?

24:19.625 --> 24:22.125
Well, a big one is
I want to partner with a brand

24:22.208 --> 24:25.583
that caters to women of color
as much as it does white women.

24:25.666 --> 24:28.125
-Well, that's why--
-You'd serve your audience best

24:28.208 --> 24:29.833
with a more established brand.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.083
One that already
has a proven track record

24:31.166 --> 24:34.125
in that department.
Like Revlon.

24:34.208 --> 24:36.166
You'd have to be seen using
only our products,

24:36.250 --> 24:38.083
the best in the industry,
so no loss there.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.416
And you're still new.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.500
Someone like us could take you
to the next level.

24:41.583 --> 24:44.333
Our top influencer
has 34 million followers.

we can remake you into
something actually profitable.

24:55.666 --> 24:58.000

-She's from Buffalo.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.583
Hmm. I've never been.
What's it like?

25:03.666 --> 25:05.708
Yes. Please regale us
with the history

25:05.791 --> 25:07.791
of its chief export,
chicken wings.

25:07.875 --> 25:11.625
Actually, Buffalo is a pretty
interesting place, historically.

25:11.708 --> 25:14.541
Home of Grover Cleveland,
Mark Twain,

25:14.625 --> 25:16.791
and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.875
ZOYA: Yes. They host readings
at his childhood home

25:18.958 --> 25:20.875
every year on his birthday.
I've never missed one.

25:20.958 --> 25:21.958
But if you want to talk
Buffalo pride,

25:22.041 --> 25:24.750
the town really came together
during the BLM protests.

25:24.833 --> 25:27.208
-It was--
-You know, I owned the Bills
for one season.

25:27.291 --> 25:30.333
It was the worst investment
I ever had.

25:30.416 --> 25:33.625
Still, it got you and Otto
to make much-needed renovations

25:33.708 --> 25:34.708
at that stadium.

25:34.791 --> 25:36.458
We've done so much
business together.

25:36.541 --> 25:37.791
Who can remember it all?

25:37.875 --> 25:39.916
My dad and I used to go
to that stadium all the--

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Tell me, how did
Jakarta Tower hold up

25:42.083 --> 25:42.708
after the last earthquake?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.541
Solid as a rock.

25:44.625 --> 25:47.500
I never thought we'd ever get
that damn thing finished

25:47.583 --> 25:49.375
with Hamish and Jake and Eliza

25:49.458 --> 25:51.958
at each other's throats
the whole time.

25:52.041 --> 25:54.166
My half-siblings. Much older.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.458
-From his early wives.
-ZOYA: I know who they are.

25:56.541 --> 25:59.333
I read about them,
and you, a lot.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.208
And it's all true.

26:01.291 --> 26:03.083
You know, they didn't really
give one whit about me.

26:03.166 --> 26:05.166
All they care about is, uh,

26:05.250 --> 26:07.583
who I'll put in charge
when I die.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.916
Oh, except for my boy here.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.583
This boy, he calls me
on my birthday.

26:14.666 --> 26:16.583
He texts just to say hello.

26:16.666 --> 26:20.875
I never have to worry about
poison in my sherry

26:20.958 --> 26:23.083
-with him around.
-An occupational hazard

when you run
a right-wing propaganda machine

26:26.041 --> 26:28.833
bent on destabilizing
global democracy, am I right?

26:32.708 --> 26:36.083
-Well said.
-I like a girl with an opinion.

26:36.166 --> 26:39.083
You say opinion, but this girl
says kind of factual.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.291
What other opinions
do you have, girl?

26:41.375 --> 26:43.958
Have you given more thought
about relocating the NetCorp

26:44.041 --> 26:45.458
to the Navy Yard?

26:45.541 --> 26:46.916
Come have a tour
while you're here.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.250
There have been protests
at that development all week.

26:49.333 --> 26:50.500
-Zoya--
-AUDREY: Really?

26:50.583 --> 26:52.125
Have there been? Do tell.

26:52.208 --> 26:53.500
-Audrey--
-HELENA: Zoya's right.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.333

to your parents, so I'm sorry.

37:09.833 --> 37:11.916
Sixty-ninth and York please.
It's an emergency.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.208
It's okay. Whatever it is,
it'll be okay, all right?

37:14.291 --> 37:15.416
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Come here. I love you.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.250

when you get there, all right?
-Okay.

37:21.458 --> 37:22.583
Hey.

37:30.166 --> 37:30.250
Yeah?

37:31.541 --> 37:33.375
You're mad.

37:37.041 --> 37:38.625
Why'd you have to go
so hard at him?

37:38.708 --> 37:39.958
Roger? He said it was fine.

37:40.041 --> 37:41.500
Of course he said
it was fine, Zoya.

37:41.583 --> 37:42.166
-And my mom...
-Your mom what?

37:45.250 --> 37:46.166
Never mind.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.500
Yeah, she doesn't like me.
I get it.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.791
Should she, after
how you behaved in there?

37:51.875 --> 37:52.250
How I behaved?

37:54.875 --> 37:56.916
You know, I'm sure she thinks
that you're fine.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.125
(SCOFFS) Okay. Look, I know you
didn't want me coming tonight,

38:00.208 --> 38:02.166
but you know something?
I'm glad that I did.

38:02.250 --> 38:05.416
Because now I know that
your mom's not the problem.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.000
It's how you are
when you're around her.

38:07.083 --> 38:07.791
Of course it's not her.
Like it's not Simon.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.250
Like it's not Gossip Girl.

38:09.333 --> 38:12.625
Like it's not any number
of things that you blame.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.500
The problem is me, and the fact
that you don't seem
to like me anymore.

38:15.583 --> 38:16.958
Pot, meet the kettle.

38:17.625 --> 38:19.125
Zoya, what are you saying?

38:19.208 --> 38:20.416
Julien said to stand up
for myself tonight,

38:20.500 --> 38:23.166
to not let you pull away,
to-- to fight for what I want.

38:23.250 --> 38:26.250
But I guess that only works
for you and your mom

38:26.333 --> 38:27.250
-if it's Julien.
-Wow.

38:27.333 --> 38:29.166
I see how you are
when you're around her.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.458

38:38.125 --> 38:39.916
Obie, tell her
we're still talking.

38:41.708 --> 38:43.458
I have to go.

38:44.208 --> 38:46.250
You're already gone, aren't you?

38:54.333 --> 38:55.583
Nice to have met you, dear.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.041
Do not go anywhere! Please!

39:06.125 --> 39:09.208
How long were you waiting there,
creeper?

39:09.291 --> 39:11.208
I knew it wasn't
a casual dinner.

39:11.291 --> 39:13.208
Plus, weekends are my shift.

39:13.291 --> 39:16.000
And bullet point six
in your manila manifesto

39:16.083 --> 39:19.208
was to keep up posts on teachers
to avert suspicion.

39:19.291 --> 39:21.375
Doesn't feel good being
a subject, though, does it?

39:21.458 --> 39:23.458
That gossip shoe
is on the other girl's foot,

39:23.541 --> 39:25.083
and that metaphor
didn't work at all,

39:25.166 --> 39:26.708
-so I'm gonna stop.
-I was there

39:26.791 --> 39:29.541
to get more information
on Zoya and Julien's mother,

39:29.625 --> 39:30.875
which I did.

39:30.958 --> 39:32.541
Great. Give it to me.
I'll post it.

39:32.625 --> 39:34.625
I can't. He'll know
it was from me.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.875
So you got information
you can never use?

39:36.958 --> 39:41.208
I can use it at some point,
very strategically.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.083
You lost all objectivity

39:43.166 --> 39:45.291
the second you stepped foot
in that apartment.

39:45.375 --> 39:47.125
You should have said no
to dinner.

39:47.208 --> 39:50.208
You wanna play God?
You have to be above it all.

39:50.291 --> 39:52.958
You can't expose the truth
when you're a part of it.

39:53.041 --> 39:54.208
It's not that simple.

39:54.291 --> 39:58.541
And once you end it with him,
and with Zoya, it will be again.

40:04.833 --> 40:07.583
-What?
-I'm proud of you, that's all.

40:07.666 --> 40:08.708
You said you'd do something
great with your platform,

40:08.791 --> 40:10.625
and you did.

40:11.833 --> 40:12.458
It's the Calloway guarantee,
right?

40:16.333 --> 40:19.333
Is Luna trying to
talk you out of Sephora?

40:19.416 --> 40:21.375
No. I'm waiting on Zoya.

40:21.458 --> 40:22.916
She told me she'd call me
after dinner

40:23.000 --> 40:24.958
and tell me how it went,
but it's 11:00.

40:25.041 --> 40:26.166
And what are you hoping to hear?

40:26.250 --> 40:28.166
That it went well
or that it didn't?

40:28.250 --> 40:29.333
Of course that it went well.

40:29.416 --> 40:32.625
You can tell me you still have
feelings for him.

40:32.708 --> 40:35.375
Maybe I still have feelings
for him, but Obie's with Zoya.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.583
Not right now, he isn't.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.583

What are you doing here?

40:45.666 --> 40:48.166
Hey, can you stop, uh,
messing with my life, please?

40:49.833 --> 40:51.708
What? How am I messing
with your life?

40:51.791 --> 40:53.291
Um, ambushing my mom,

40:53.375 --> 40:55.250
telling Zoya to invite herself
to family dinner, and...

40:55.333 --> 40:56.708
encouraging her
to Zoya all over everyone

40:56.791 --> 40:58.666
once she's there.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.458
-I was just trying to help.
-Why?

41:01.541 --> 41:02.625
Why are you trying to help?

41:02.708 --> 41:03.833
What do you mean, "Why?"
She's my sister.

41:03.916 --> 41:05.666
And that's it?

41:07.083 --> 41:09.000
You're not trying to sabotage it

41:09.083 --> 41:09.833

41:09.916 --> 41:11.791
