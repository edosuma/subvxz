for a dog of our own.

Well, it looks like Pico
is gonna get his
first taste of the action.

According to paramedics,
the victim is a woman
called Fabienne Jordan.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.320
Fifty-six years of age.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.240

to visit the faith healer.

Steadman King.

the middle of healing her
when she started convulsing.

-She died before
the ambulance arrived.
-Cause of death?

05:49.880 --> 05:52.320

some sort of seizure.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.120
Okay, Dwayne. Hit me.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.320
-What have we got?
-So,

05:59.400 --> 06:02.120
the nephew said that Fabienne
came here to have
her eyesight restored.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.640
She'd come up onto the stage
and taken a sip of
the holy water.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.440
The pastor placed
his hands on her

06:07.520 --> 06:09.280
and then, boom. Down she went.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.040
-And this hers?
-DWAYNE: Yes, Chief.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.800
But there's nothing
much of interest inside it.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.880
Her purse, house keys,

06:16.960 --> 06:20.240
some tissues,
old sweet wrappers,
you know, that kind of thing.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.520
Hmm. Poor woman.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.120
She came here expecting
a new lease of life,

06:25.200 --> 06:26.840
-she ends up dead.
-Mmm.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.520
FLORENCE: What is it, sir?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.080
Looks like burn marks
on her lips.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.360
And inside her mouth, too.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.720
You mean the kind
you get when you...

06:47.800 --> 06:50.640
When you've ingested poison,
yeah. Exactly like that.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.360
And the convulsions started
just after she drank from this?

06:53.440 --> 06:54.400
Er, yes, Chief.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.960
Well, there's nothing there.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.200
But there's something
in this cup.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.120
Sharp.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.160
It's not pleasant.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.240
Someone wanted her dead?

07:13.320 --> 07:15.760
(SIGHS) I'm afraid it's looking
that way, Florence.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.120
-Murdered?
-That can't be right.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.160
Well, there's strong evidence
to suggest that Fabienne
was poisoned.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.840
-No.
-Explain to me

07:29.920 --> 07:31.480
what led you to
this conclusion, Inspector.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.480
Well, we need to have it
confirmed by our lab

07:34.560 --> 07:36.800
but an initial examination
of the crime scene

07:36.880 --> 07:39.320
would indicate that the poison
may have been in the water

07:39.400 --> 07:41.200
that you gave her
to drink, Pastor.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.520
-It can't be.
-And you're sure about this?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.560
It's still early days,
but that's what we believe.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.400
If it was in the water,

07:48.480 --> 07:51.120
three others drank from the cup
before Fabienne.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.800
I suggest you get them
checked by the paramedics.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.400
I'm on it, sir.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.480
That's quick thinking, Pastor.
Thank you.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.760
Can you talk me through
what happened? Dashel?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.680
It was you who
brought your aunty here.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.320
Yes. Aunt Fabienne was diagnosed
with a benign brain tumour
five years ago.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.000
It caused her eyesight
to deteriorate.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.160
When she heard that the pastor
was back on the island,

08:13.240 --> 08:15.040
she jumped at the
chance to visit him.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.520
You've been away?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.920
It's 35 years now
since I left for the US.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.280
And you've been doing
the faith-healing malarkey
over there ever since?

08:22.360 --> 08:24.960
It's a big country.
Takes a lot of healing.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.240
And I'd prefer it if you
didn't refer to my life's work
as malarkey, Inspector.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.520
A turn of phrase, Pastor.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.960
Nothing...

08:32.040 --> 08:34.280
Can I ask,
why have you returned now?

08:34.360 --> 08:37.760
Well, the Lord told me
it was time to come
and give something back.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.920
-Mmm-hmm.
-Well, that's reason enough,
isn't it?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.360
Fabienne was so happy
she was gonna get
to see you again.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.200
You already knew each other?

08:46.320 --> 08:47.400
We grew up in the same village.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.480
-Oh.
-STEADMAN: Same school.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.120
We were childhood friends.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.680
And today was
the first time you had
seen her in over 35 years?

08:53.760 --> 08:56.120
Actually, Dashel
brought Fabienne to see us

08:56.200 --> 08:57.440
-the day before yesterday.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.920
STEADMAN: I didn't recognize her
at first

09:01.920 --> 09:03.440
but when she said her name,

09:04.800 --> 09:06.440
all the memories
came flooding back.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.240
Right.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.040
And when she came here today,

09:10.120 --> 09:12.960
who did she interact
with or talk to?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.040
Who else knew her?

09:14.120 --> 09:16.720
No one. We'd only just arrived.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.120
AMELIA:
I took Fabienne straight up
on stage to see Steadman.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.680
You remember Fabienne.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.640
My dear old friend.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.560
(STAMMERS) And did you see
anyone go near the cup
during the service?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.200
No one touched it but Steadman.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.680
We would have seen.
You must be wrong
about the poison.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.040
Mmm-hmm.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.760
Is something wrong, Inspector?

09:35.840 --> 09:39.880
No, no, no. It's just...
Well, it's just a bit odd,
isn't it?

09:39.960 --> 09:43.200
I mean, the pastor here
hasn't been back to
the island in decades,

09:43.280 --> 09:46.200
yet the very week
he puts in an appearance,

09:46.280 --> 09:49.000
his long-lost childhood friend
ends up being murdered.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.520
I do hope you're not suggesting
I did it.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.600
No, of course not.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.120
But you can't deny,

09:54.200 --> 09:56.840
the timing,
it's a little coincidental.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.680
I'm a faith healer, Inspector.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.640
-You understand what that means?
-Mmm.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.200
God has blessed me with a gift
to cure people's illnesses.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.560
Huh.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.080
STEADMAN:
I give them their lives back.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.200
I do not on any account
take them away.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.080
My apologies, Pastor.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.280
But I have to ask
the difficult questions.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.680
Well, er, I'll leave you all be.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.600
(SIGHS)

10:21.680 --> 10:22.720
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.680
Dwayne, JP,
we can release the body.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.080
And could you get the contents
of that jug and cup to the lab?

10:34.160 --> 10:35.800
Yes, Chief.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.880
Oh, and could you
search everyone who was
at the healing ceremony

10:37.960 --> 10:39.680
for any signs of the poison?

10:39.760 --> 10:41.800
-Vial or a bottle, maybe?
-JP: Yes, sir.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.200
Time to give something back, eh?

10:50.280 --> 10:52.360
Sir, paramedics have checked
the three people

10:52.440 --> 10:54.360
who drank from
that cup before Fabienne

10:54.440 --> 10:56.280
and none of them
have ingested any poison.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.880
Which means it must
have been added directly before
Fabienne sipped from it.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.360
But wasn't the pastor
the only one at that time
to touch the cup?

11:02.440 --> 11:04.080
(SIGHS) Well, that's what
they're saying.

11:04.160 --> 11:07.000
Then that means
he is the only one
that could have done it.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.560
But how could it be him?

11:08.640 --> 11:10.080
Surely, no one kills like that.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.320
In front of all these people.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.960
It's brazen beyond belief.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.520
But if it wasn't,

11:15.600 --> 11:18.080
how else did someone get
the poison into the cup

11:18.160 --> 11:20.520
-if they never went near it?
-I don't know, Florence.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.560
However you look at this,
it doesn't make
much sense, does it?

11:25.160 --> 11:26.560
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

11:31.320 --> 11:33.960
So, how did you get on

-Nothing. You?
-Same.

Come on, let's make our way
back to the station.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.920
Er, sure, it's just...

11:40.000 --> 11:42.360
-DWAYNE: Oh, for goodness' sake.
-JP: Mmm.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.480
Hey, dog.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.080
As your superior officer,
I command you to get up.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.760
Stand up!

11:50.920 --> 11:52.280
Part-timer.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.880
So what do we do?

11:54.960 --> 11:57.640
We? You're the one with
the dog-training certificate.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.320
He's all yours.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.560
(SIGHS)

12:01.640 --> 12:04.040
Okay. Let's do this.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.840
(STRAINING)

12:12.040 --> 12:14.240
(SIGHS)

12:14.320 --> 12:18.480
Okay, gents, and lady,
of course. Let's go through
what we have so far.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.200
Fabienne Jordan, 56.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.040
Graduated teacher training
when she was 22.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.560
Taught at Jean Roi
Primary School ever since.

12:25.640 --> 12:29.720
Took sick leave three years ago
when her eyesight
started to deteriorate.

12:29.800 --> 12:34.920
Now, Fabienne, we suspect,
was poisoned when she took a sip

12:35.000 --> 12:38.200
from a cup of water
that this man gave to her.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.480
According to all our witnesses,
no one else went near the cup.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.480
So in theory, Steadman
is the only one who could
have added the poison.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.320
But do we really believe someone
would commit murder so publicly?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.480
Dwayne, what do we have
so far on the very
Reverend Steadman King?

12:50.560 --> 12:53.120
He doesn't seem to be affiliated
to any particular church.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.840
He's worked as a faith healer,

12:54.920 --> 12:58.080
touring his shows all over
the US for the past 35 years.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.240
Now, Steadman claims
that there was no contact
between him and Fabienne

13:01.320 --> 13:02.600
since he left the island,

13:02.680 --> 13:04.360
but we need to confirm that
for ourselves.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.280
So let's check with local
and US immigration,

13:06.360 --> 13:08.320
see if they could have
crossed paths.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.440
And we should get in touch
with email and
phone service providers,

13:11.520 --> 13:13.560
see if there was
any communication that way.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.760
Now, only two people
in that marquee

13:15.840 --> 13:19.120
knew Fabienne
and had contact with her
just before she was killed.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.520
Mmm-hmm. Steadman's wife,

13:21.600 --> 13:24.840
-Amelia, and the
victim's nephew.
-Uh-huh.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.600
Dashel Jordan.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.520
So, if it wasn't the healer
who killed her,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.160
it has to be one of them.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.880
But how did they manage to get
poison into a cup of water

13:33.960 --> 13:35.680
if they didn't go anywhere near?

13:35.760 --> 13:39.120
Precisely, Florence.
JP, the wife, Amelia King.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.480
Oh, actually, sir,
she's still Amelia Carris.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.640
From what I can tell,
her and Steadman
never got married.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.280
Oh.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.880
So, born and
raised in Mississippi.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.680
Studied business management
at college and worked
at a whiskey distillery firm

13:51.760 --> 13:53.840
-until she met Steadman.
-Lucky her.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.320
But as Amelia only met Fabienne
for the first time two days ago,

13:57.400 --> 13:59.920
it's unlikely she has a motive
to want her dead.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.040
Yeah. And finally,

14:02.120 --> 14:05.200
Dashel Jordan. Age 30.
Fabienne's nephew.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.800
Married, one child aged two,
owner of a restaurant
called The Rum Cafe.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.360
Lives with his family nearby.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.960
Dashel is the only person
to have known Fabienne
in the present.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.560
Well, let's see what we can
find out about
their relationship.

14:17.640 --> 14:21.200
I know the chef who used to
run The Rum Cafe before
Dashel bought it off of her.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.760
-I can see if
she knows anything.
-Go for it, Dwayne.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.720
I'll hit her with it first thing
in the morning, Chief.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.280
Yeah.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.880
Well, until we
get the post-mortem
and toxicology results,

14:29.960 --> 14:31.560
very little we can do here.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.560
Let's pick it up afresh
again in the morning.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.640
Okay.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.080
DWAYNE: So you think there's
something wrong with him?

14:44.160 --> 14:45.360
Who, the Inspector?

14:45.440 --> 14:47.000
No, your new friend.

14:47.080 --> 14:50.040
-Rip Van Pico.
-Oh, no, no, he's just,
you know,

14:50.120 --> 14:51.760
preserving his energy.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.440
-Oh, really?
-(CAR HONKS)

14:55.040 --> 14:56.280
Oh, Darlene.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.240
It's been a hot day.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.200
And I was wondering if you fancy
cooling off with me in the bar?

15:03.280 --> 15:06.440
You know, Darlene,
I can think of nothing
I'd like more than that.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.440
Then jump in, Officer Myers.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.720
But I've only just agreed
this minute to meet up
with an old friend of mine.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.120
Another time, maybe?

15:16.200 --> 15:18.280
-I'll hold you to it.
-I'll make sure you do.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.160
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

15:24.760 --> 15:26.840
So, you fancy a beer
at Catherine's?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.920
But I just heard you say
you're meeting up with...

15:29.000 --> 15:30.560
Yes, I know what I said.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.800
But what I said wasn't true.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.440
I thought things were going well
with you and Darlene.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.840
It's tactics, JP. Gamesmanship.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.960
And I'm playing a particularly
sophisticated game here,

15:41.040 --> 15:42.840
in case you hadn't noticed.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.040
I hadn't.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.360
Page one of the dating textbook.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.960
If you want to keep
a woman interested,

15:49.040 --> 15:51.800
make her think that you are not,
comprende?

15:51.880 --> 15:54.840
-And that actually works?
-Hasn't failed me yet.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.840
So you and poochie
coming for a drink or what?

16:03.720 --> 16:05.560
How do I serve God?

16:05.640 --> 16:08.120
And I have to
tell you, friends,
my heart hung heavy.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.560
I had to pray on that.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.840
And I walked in here
and I realised,

16:12.920 --> 16:14.960
there's no one way
you serve God.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.080
-Can I get an amen on that?
-ALL: Amen.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.880
-(PAUSES VIDEO)
-Takes some bottle, doesn't it?

16:18.960 --> 16:22.080
Standing up on stage,
trying to convince
a whole room full of people

16:22.160 --> 16:23.640
that you can heal their ills.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.120
You know, back in Ireland, we
got faith healers by the dozen.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.960
"Having the cure" we call it.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.680
But over there,
it's a community thing.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.280
They don't by and large
charge you for it.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.640
So when I see someone
like this making literally
bucketloads of money from it,

16:35.720 --> 16:36.840
brings out the sceptic in me.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.280
You think he scams people?

16:38.360 --> 16:40.120
Well, I don't think God's work,

16:40.200 --> 16:41.520
if that's what this is,

16:41.600 --> 16:43.400
requires a fee pay.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.320
Then if he's a fake, maybe
he could be the killer, too.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.960
Maybe, Florence, maybe.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.840
So, you're coming or staying?

16:49.920 --> 16:52.120
No, no, you go on ahead.
I won't be much longer.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.320
(SIGHS)

16:57.440 --> 16:58.960
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

17:32.160 --> 17:35.200
Right, Fabienne.
Let's see who you really are.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.880
Think of your waistline, Jack.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.720
Mmm.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.680
"Fabienne, Steadman
and Wallace."

18:35.760 --> 18:36.720
Mmm.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.720
Morning, sir.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.040
Ah, Florence, how are you?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.200
I'm very well, sir.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.280
And I bring good news.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.520
Post-mortem and lab results were
emailed through first thing.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.400
And you were right.
Cause of death was poisoning.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.560
When they tested the water
in the cup, they found...

19:01.640 --> 19:03.600
Significant traces
of nicotine syrup.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.000
Nicotine poisoning?

19:05.080 --> 19:07.040
I checked online
and it's fairly easy to make.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.360
You just boil down
cigarette tobacco in water.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.320
So in theory,
any of our suspects could have
the means to make it.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.760
Mmm-hmm. What's all this?

19:14.840 --> 19:17.880
Last night, I had a little
shufty round Fabienne's house.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.280
And I found these diaries.
Late teens, early twenties.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.160
Sounds like
you've found something.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.160
I have. And it's Steadman.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.680
He's been lying to us.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.320
He told us that he and Fabienne
were just childhood friends.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.200
-But it was more than that?
-Yeah. Since the age of 18,

19:32.280 --> 19:34.280
they were an item.
The best part of two years.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.400
Here, look at this.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.160
June 25th, 1984.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.560
FLORENCE: "Marrying Steadman
will be a dream come true.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.320
"I can't wait for us to start
making the arrangements."

19:42.400 --> 19:43.520
They were engaged?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.680
Yeah, all set to be married.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.560
Until he and his mate,
this fella, Wallace Miller,

19:49.640 --> 19:51.560
they left for a short trip
to America together.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.320
Steadman was going to study
the Bible over there.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.160
-And what happened?
-Well, completely
out of the blue,

19:56.240 --> 19:58.080
Steadman sends her a letter

19:58.160 --> 20:00.880
saying the relationship's over
and he's not coming back.
Just like that.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.120
-Does he say why?
-I can't find anything
in the diaries.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.800
But what I'd like to know is
why did Steadman
keep that from us?

20:07.880 --> 20:10.040
Why did he lie?

20:10.120 --> 20:12.160
I realise how
this must look, Inspector,

20:12.240 --> 20:13.800
but I'm very happy to explain.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.800
What it looks like, Mr King,

20:15.880 --> 20:18.480
is that you were lying to
police officers
investigating a murder.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.880
I just didn't think
it was relevant.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.360
My relationship with Fabienne
ended decades ago.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.960
What possible link
could that have to her
being murdered now?

20:26.040 --> 20:28.480
But surely you can see
the only link is you.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.320
And it's not for you to decide
what is or isn't relevant.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.720
-STEADMAN: I understand.
-Everything all right,
sweetheart?

20:34.480 --> 20:35.920
Amelia, would you, er,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.120
fetch that box I keep
my personal stuff in?

20:38.200 --> 20:39.280
Yeah.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.800
You know, I was 20
when I arrived in the States.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.760
I had a great ambition
to serve the Lord.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.880
And I knew I would never achieve
what he wanted

20:51.960 --> 20:54.880
if I returned to Saint Marie
and settled down with Fabienne.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.040
Thanks, honey.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.760
These are letters Fabienne
sent to me in America.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.920
You'll see,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.840
although she's upset,

21:08.920 --> 21:11.560
she accepts the reasons
I gave for breaking up
our relationship.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.840
There was nothing sinister

21:13.920 --> 21:17.000
in how things ended
between Fabienne and me.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.440
Certainly nothing that
would lead to my poisoning her
all these years later.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.960
-Ah, morning sir. Sarge.
-Morning, JP.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.080
And morning, Pico.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.640
And how are you today?

21:32.720 --> 21:34.840
Sir, I've just been
to the school that
Fabienne taught at.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.520
I spoke to the headmistress.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.520
She told me that Fabienne
and Steadman were
a couple back in the day.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.680
We've just been speaking
to Steadman about it.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.480
Well, apparently,
Fabienne never got over it.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.080
She felt Steadman was the
only man she could ever love.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.320
In fact,
she never met anyone else.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.320
-It hurt that much?
-Hmm.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.200
Hmm. Where has Dwayne got to?

21:53.280 --> 21:55.640
He's gone to visit the chef
who used to own The Rum Cafe.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.560
Ah, that's very
proactive of him.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.760
Going the extra mile.
Good to hear.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.640
My Creole spiced eggs.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.640
It was always my favourite dish
of yours, you know, Marjorie?

22:06.720 --> 22:10.520
(CHUCKLES) So, we better
get down to business.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.000
Tell me about the guy who's
running your old restaurant.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.200
FLORENCE: So, I checked
with local and US immigration,

22:17.280 --> 22:19.160
seems Fabienne never even
left the island.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.080
-Never?
-As for Steadman
and Amelia King,

22:22.160 --> 22:25.680
neither had set foot
in Saint Marie since he left
the island 35 years ago.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.000
Hmm. What about phone
or email records?

22:28.080 --> 22:31.320
Nothing to link Fabienne
to either the faith healer
or his wife.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.960
Right, so Steadman really
didn't communicate with her

22:34.040 --> 22:35.480
since that last letter?

22:35.560 --> 22:38.280
Which gives him even less reason
to want her dead.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.440
Why would you murder someone
with nicotine poison

22:40.520 --> 22:43.160
you haven't clapped eyes
on in 35 years?

22:43.240 --> 22:46.520
Sir, I think I might have
something for you.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.040
So I've just been speaking
to the solicitor that's
been handling Fabienne's estate

22:50.120 --> 22:52.640
and it turns out she changed her
will just under a month ago.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.840
In whose favour?

22:53.920 --> 22:56.040
Her nephew's, Dashel Jordan.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.840
See, Fabienne
told the solicitor that Dashel
had been looking after her

22:58.920 --> 23:00.240
and she wanted to reward him,

23:00.320 --> 23:02.280
but the solicitor
advised caution.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.360
See, Dashel had
only been back in her life
for a matter of months.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.480
So the loving nephew didn't look
after her for
as long as he made out?

23:08.560 --> 23:10.200
And what does
he stand to inherit?

23:10.280 --> 23:13.160
Well, what cash she has left.
Assets, house.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.320
In total, it's around $65,000.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.720
And that's a fair few bob.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.720
Question is how desperate
was Dashel for the cash?

23:19.240 --> 23:20.560
I'd say very.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.520
I just spoke to
my chef friend, Marjorie,

23:22.600 --> 23:25.080
and apparently,
ever since Dashel
took over the restaurant,

23:25.160 --> 23:27.280
business has been
far from booming.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.200
-Well, I never.
-You better believe it.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.160
She's still in touch
with the staff there.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.640
And they said that
all the customers have
as good as disappeared.

23:34.720 --> 23:38.480
There's final demand bills
landing all over the doormat.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.520
Only last week,
the bailiffs turned up.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.480
So, Dashel needs
a big injection of money.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.720
Mmm-hmm.
And now Fabienne's dead,

23:44.800 --> 23:46.160
that's exactly what he's got.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.080
-Put this one as well,
all right?
-Okay.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.760
Inspector.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.600
-Erm, how can I help?
-Ah, just a quick chat, Dashel.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.320
Of course. Let's...
Let's go over here.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.120
JACK: Fairly quiet, isn't it?

24:03.200 --> 24:05.520
Just waiting on the lunchtime
rush to start, you know?

24:05.600 --> 24:07.120
JACK: At quarter to 2:00
in the afternoon?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.960
Well, people round here
generally like to
have a late lunch.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.560
Right! Interesting.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.240
I never knew that.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.240
Only, we've heard that things
have been quiet
for some time now.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.320
FLORENCE: Pretty much ever since
you took over two years ago.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.920
-Is that true?
-Well, when the
previous owner left,

24:21.000 --> 24:22.520
people stopped coming.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.840
I think they thought
with a different chef,
it wouldn't be the same.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.600
Mmm.
So what are you going to do?

24:26.680 --> 24:28.920
We'll manage. Somehow.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.840
Well, we've just spoken with
your aunt's solicitor

24:31.920 --> 24:34.440
and apparently,
she left everything to you.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.080
But I'm guessing
you probably know that.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.760
Aunt Fabienne was very generous.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.320
-I'm grateful to her.
-Oh, I'd say you are, all right.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.800
You're up that creek
with a paddle shortage

24:44.880 --> 24:47.400
and your aunt has just thrown
you one hell of a lifeline.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.400
You're not saying
that I killed her?

24:49.480 --> 24:51.440
But I wouldn't! I couldn't!

24:51.520 --> 24:53.640
Well, if I had a dollar
for every time I heard that,

24:53.720 --> 24:55.440
I'd be able to take
early retirement. Yeah.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.200
Buy a couple of acres
back in Cork, small cottage,
some chickens.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.840
Mmm, maybe even a goat or two.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.200
Look, I tried everything
to make this place work.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.360
I came this close
to losing it all.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.080
And then you remembered
good old Aunt Fabienne.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.640
(SIGHS)

25:09.720 --> 25:11.840
I admit it.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.080
If I didn't need the money,
I would never have made contact.

25:15.880 --> 25:20.160
I'm not proud of that,
Inspector, but I'm not a killer.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.960
Ask anyone inside
of that marquee,

25:22.040 --> 25:25.320
I didn't go anywhere
near the cup
that poisoned my aunt.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.160
Apart from Reverend King,
no one did.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.160
(MOBILE VIBRATING)

25:32.080 --> 25:33.280
-Huh?
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

25:33.360 --> 25:34.440
Is that Darlene?

25:34.520 --> 25:37.360
Yes, she has a
quite a way with words.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.520
She wants to meet up later.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.200
But you're not
going to reply now?

25:41.280 --> 25:43.080
Uh-uh. Chief.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.360
As police dogs go,
he'd make a great draught
excluder, wouldn't he?

25:47.560 --> 25:48.920
No, you're grand, JP.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.840
Let sleeping dogs lie
and all that.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.800
Hmm.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.800
I don't suppose you lads
have managed to solve
the entire case, by any chance?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.440
Sorry, Chief. Not quite.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.640
But we've had
the financial checks back on
Steadman and Amelia.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.000
Ooh, I'm all ears.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.520
They're doing very well
for themselves.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.480
Between them,
they've got savings
of up to $600,000.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.200
-Ooh!
-I told you, Florence.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.360
It's not a charitable endeavour
Steadman's running.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.560
It's a lucrative business.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.280
I also noticed that recently

26:14.360 --> 26:16.760
they've moved
their accounts from the US
to banks based in Europe.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.240
Really? And do we know why?

26:18.320 --> 26:20.920
I called their accountant.
He was reluctant to talk to me,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.720
but, erm, I got chatting to his
secretary, Tiffany, and, er,

26:24.800 --> 26:26.960
she liked my accent, so
I got her to open up.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.680
And what did Tiffany
have to say?

26:28.760 --> 26:31.240
As far as she knew,
the faith healer had left
the States for good.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.920
There was a scandal brewing

26:33.000 --> 26:35.920
and he had to get out and start
afresh in a different country.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.920
Scandal? What kind of scandal?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.360
I'm afraid Tiffany wouldn't
give me any more than that.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.800
She said she wasn't one
to spread gossip.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.280
So there's more to Steadman's
return than divine calling.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.920
Everything comes back to him,
doesn't it?

26:48.520 --> 26:49.920
Every time.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.880
(GRUNTS)

26:51.960 --> 26:55.800
If Steadman has killed Fabienne,
then it must have
something to do

26:55.880 --> 26:57.840
with the last time they
knew each other 35 years ago.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.840
-Wallace Miller.
-What about him?

26:59.920 --> 27:02.360
Well, it looks like
he grew up with them both.

27:02.440 --> 27:05.440
Dwayne, JP, see if
you can track Wallace down.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.640
Now, we know he travelled
to the US when Steadman
moved there.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.680
Beyond that,
it's a bit of a blank.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.920
-See what you can do.
-Yes, sir.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.440
The village Steadman
and Fabienne grew up in.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.040
-Where is it?
-Erm, Saint Boulestre.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.960
I think it's on the other side
of the island.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.480
Well, I think we
should go there.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.440
See if we can find any
old friends of theirs,

27:22.520 --> 27:23.920
neighbours, anyone
who knows them.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.960
"Let's go to Saint Boulestre,"
he said.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.440
Huh. Let's interview the locals.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.120
If we could only find some.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.800
Sorry to startle you.
DI Mooney, DS Cassell.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.440
You'd be on the night shift,
by any chance?

27:53.520 --> 27:55.640
(SIGHS) And the day shift.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.080
We wanted to ask the locals
a few questions.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.160
-But it looks like...
-They're long gone.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.040
Developers moved everyone.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.400
No one here but me
and a few goats.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.840
You won't get much out of them.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.840
(CHUCKLES) Do you have any other
residents' contact details?

28:09.920 --> 28:12.400
Got the number
of the building company,
if that helps.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.440
Great!

28:16.080 --> 28:17.240
Here we go.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.480
Must get lonely around here.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.800
You know, it's the most
company I've had for ages.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.600
You guys today,
the preacher man yesterday.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.560
-Preacher man?
-Faith healer.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.680
Came to see his family home
before it's knocked down.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.920
What did he do
when he was in here?

28:40.080 --> 28:41.200
Had a look around.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.600
And how long did he stay?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.320
-Half an hour.
-Okay if we have a look?

28:44.400 --> 28:45.520
Sure.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.960
You think he was here
just for old times' sake, sir?

28:52.040 --> 28:53.360
Maybe.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.080
Or maybe there's
something he left here,

28:55.160 --> 28:56.440
and he came back to collect it.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.640
He's up to something.
I'm sure of it.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.800
Yeah. In the morning,
when the court opens,

29:00.880 --> 29:02.800
we request a warrant
and we go search his villa.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.920
Yeah.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.880
Ay, ay, ay.
Good to see you, Darlene!

29:15.960 --> 29:18.240
Looking lovely, as usual.

29:20.480 --> 29:24.200
Oh. So, what can I get you
to drink, hmm?

29:24.280 --> 29:27.080
I'm going to give you
one chance to apologise.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.720
And if you want
this relationship
to have any kind of future,

29:30.800 --> 29:34.400
-I suggest you take it.
-Apologise, Darlene? What for?

29:34.480 --> 29:35.880
I know what you've been up to,
Dwayne Myers.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.440
Ignoring my texts.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.200
Cancelling dates.
You've been playing
hard-to-get, haven't you?

29:40.280 --> 29:42.920
I... Never. I wouldn't do that.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.920
-Especially with you, Darlene.
-I'll say it again.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.880
Once chance. Say you're sorry

29:48.960 --> 29:50.720
and I can just start
enjoying the evening.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.040
I, er... Well...

29:54.120 --> 29:56.080
-Erm... You know...
-(MOTORCYCLE HORN HONKING)

29:56.480 --> 29:58.000
I, er...

29:58.080 --> 29:59.680
-Right.
-I, er...

29:59.760 --> 30:01.000
That means your time's up.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.120
What?

30:03.480 --> 30:06.000
This is Gerald.
My substitute date.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.080
Night, Dwayne.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.400
Who the hell is Gerald?

30:19.040 --> 30:20.560
I made us dinner.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.080
I had a feeling you were
going to come back and work.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.160
Well, fair play to you,
Florence. What is it?

30:26.240 --> 30:28.600
-Ta-dum!
-Mooney's meatballs.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.960
-Good on ya!
-I found the recipe online.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.200
-I hope they're okay.
-I'm sure they'll be fantastic.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.520
Tell you what,
you grab the plates
and the cutlery,

30:35.600 --> 30:38.080
I'll see if there's a few beers
lurking in that fridge.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.840
So, you're working
late a lot, sir.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.360
Since Dwayne moved out,
you seem to be spending
all your evenings here.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.200
You're not worried about me,
I hope, Florence?

30:46.280 --> 30:47.840
I'm just checking
if you're all right.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.480
-Is that allowed?
-That's allowed.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.560
(EXHALES)

30:51.640 --> 30:54.960
Yeah, I guess you're right about
me staying late a bit.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.600
I'm just not accustomed
to having the shack to myself.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.920
So used to having
a daughter around.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.640
It's not that long ago
I had a wife as well.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.280
Ah, the shack is great.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.080
It just, it doesn't really
feel like home yet.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.560
Then you need
to make it your own.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.280
Make it somewhere you want to go
after a day's work.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.720
And how would I do that?

31:17.480 --> 31:19.760
What do you miss the most about
your home back in London?

31:20.200 --> 31:22.080
(EXHALES)

31:22.160 --> 31:24.400
My record player. Yeah.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.680
Sunday afternoons,
I used to cook a big roast,

31:26.760 --> 31:29.800
sink into an armchair,
pull on the old headphones,

31:29.880 --> 31:31.440
stick on the vinyl.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.960
Yeah. Heaven.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.320
There you go.
That's your answer.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.040
You know,
I like your thinking, Florence.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.760
A record player.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.040
Hmm.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.200
So, how are the meatballs?

31:44.280 --> 31:45.400
Hmm.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.640
Yeah, excellent. Delicious.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.120
Nearly as good as mine.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.480
(CHUCKLES)

32:18.600 --> 32:20.280
FLORENCE:
Okay, thanks for your help.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.720
(GRUNTING)

32:23.800 --> 32:26.720
I've been through these diaries
and letters a dozen times now.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.680
Not even a hint of why
Steadman might kill Fabienne.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.160
How are you getting on?

32:31.240 --> 32:33.680
I've called round all of the old
residents of Saint Boulestre.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.680
-And?
-Most people just remember

32:35.760 --> 32:40.160
Fabienne and Steadman being
happy and very much in love.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.600
But there were
a few who also remembered

32:42.680 --> 32:44.880
the friend Steadman
went to the US with.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.600
Oh, yes. Wallace Miller.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.320
They said there was a rift
between Steadman and Wallace

32:49.400 --> 32:51.960
when Steadman
got engaged to Fabienne.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.280
Apparently, Wallace
didn't approve.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.040
Really? Did they say why?

32:56.120 --> 32:58.080
No one ever really knew.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.840
Well, hopefully Dwayne'll
manage to get ahold
of this Wallace fella.

33:02.640 --> 33:07.640
Steadman King.
Returns to Saint Marie
after a hiatus of 35 years.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.800
And within a week of his return,

33:09.880 --> 33:11.840
his old high school
sweetheart is dead.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.400
As he's the only person
who touched the cup

33:14.480 --> 33:17.000
that contained
the poison that killed her,

33:17.080 --> 33:19.000
-it has to be him that did it.
-Yeah.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.440
Well, the man's arrogant enough

33:21.520 --> 33:24.040
to think that he
can perform miracles.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.840
But is he really arrogant enough
to commit murder

33:25.920 --> 33:28.040
in a room full of witnesses
and get away with it?

33:28.120 --> 33:30.280
And if he is,
how do we prove it...

33:30.360 --> 33:32.880
-(SCOFFS)
-...when there is
no sign of a motive?

33:32.960 --> 33:37.520
(SIGHS) Why would he
come back here to kill a woman
he hasn't seen for 35 years?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.320
What I wouldn't give for
a bit of divine intervention

33:39.400 --> 33:40.360
-right now.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.520
Thank you, we're on our way.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.920

has been granted.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.640
-STEADMAN: What's going on?
-They have a search warrant.

33:59.720 --> 34:03.560
Tell me, what exactly do you
expect to find here, Inspector?

34:03.640 --> 34:05.080
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.720
Okay, Pico.
Saint Helene's finest.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.040
Now is your chance to shine.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.280
I guess we do this
the old-fashioned way.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.600
(SIGHS)

34:57.080 --> 35:00.280
You think there's poison
in my cosmetics?

35:00.360 --> 35:02.480
Well, I wouldn't be
doing my job properly

35:02.560 --> 35:04.880
if I didn't at
least consider it.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.200
So, where would I find
Steadman's toiletries?

35:08.280 --> 35:09.680
In his bedroom.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.120
You have separate bedrooms?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.400
You know full well
we have, Inspector.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.680
You were in there
less than a minute ago.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.720
I'm a very light sleeper

35:18.800 --> 35:20.640
and Steadman is
a very heavy snorer.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.800
A crime I've been accused
of myself many's the time.

35:23.880 --> 35:27.560
It used to drive my missus
up the wall. Said it was
like sleeping with a walrus.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.200
Although, how'd she know that...

(JACK CHUCKLES)

35:30.600 --> 35:33.040
Can I ask,
what's with the wedding rings?

35:33.120 --> 35:35.240
You know, with you two
not actually being married?

35:36.040 --> 35:38.040
We've been together years.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.800
The bond between us
is very strong.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.520
But you're right,
we're not husband and wife.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.160
We're manager and client.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.320
Jesus is your product.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.120
And Steadman's your salesman.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.320
Our customers are not the type
who take too kindly
to us not being wed.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.960
-So...
-A little white lie.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.880
-To protect Steadman.
-From what?

35:56.960 --> 35:59.280
Exposure.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.880
Some of our congregation
may not take too kindly to his,
erm, leanings.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.160
He's gay.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.960
Ah. Is that why he left the
island all those years ago?

36:11.040 --> 36:13.160
I think deep down
in his subconscious,

36:13.240 --> 36:16.160
he recognised
that marrying Fabienne
was not the right thing to do.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.200
And would this have anything
to do with a scandal

36:19.280 --> 36:21.560
that I hear is brewing
back in the States?

36:21.640 --> 36:25.200
One of our
regular congregation caught
Steadman in a bar with a man.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.680
He'd one drink too many.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.520
Should never
have even been there.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.240
We tried to deal with it.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.320
But money holds little sway
over a devout believer.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.040
She felt people had a right
to know the truth.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.600
-So what happens now?
-We keep going.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.960
There's a whole world out there
needs our help.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.560
-Oh, yeah?
-We'll be heading to Europe

36:43.640 --> 36:45.240
-when we're done here.
-Hmm.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.560
Hmm.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.800
So, how does all this reckon
with the big man upstairs?

36:51.880 --> 36:53.960
The hypocrisy, the lies?

36:54.040 --> 36:56.080
Oh, come on, Inspector.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.800
There's no big man upstairs.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.880
There's no upstairs.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.560
Knows exactly
where her bread is buttered.

37:15.640 --> 37:19.000
So, what, you think she killed
Fabienne to protect Steadman?

37:19.080 --> 37:20.160
Maybe.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.920
But even if she
was the one who did it,

37:23.080 --> 37:25.760
we still come back
to the same problem.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.440
Can't find a reason for Steadman
to want Fabienne dead.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.280

37:49.640 --> 37:51.120
Think of your waistline, Jack.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.960
Well, I never.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.360
(CHUCKLES TRIUMPHANTLY)

37:57.440 --> 37:59.480
Fabienne had the
same make of sweet

37:59.560 --> 38:01.560
in her handbag and at her house.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.040
Which means it's either
another coincidence

38:04.680 --> 38:06.520
or she was here.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.200
She never set foot
inside the place.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.080
Oh, fair enough.
We'll just get it
checked for prints.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.720
Yeah. Tell me, Steadman,

38:13.800 --> 38:16.240
how did the visit
to your old house
in Saint Boulestre go?

38:16.920 --> 38:17.880
(GASPS)

38:20.080 --> 38:21.960
I heard it was
gonna be demolished.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.920
Wanted one last look.
Nothing wrong with that,
is there?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.240
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:26.320 --> 38:28.040
-You're a smoker, I see?
-Yes.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.000
A habit I can't seem to kick.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.680
No, it's just the poison that
killed Fabienne was nicotine.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.280
And here you are
with a packet of fags!

38:35.360 --> 38:37.720
Well, they're
freely available, Inspector.

38:37.800 --> 38:41.080
Yet another one of
those coincidences that
we keep stumbling across.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.000
Sir,

38:43.080 --> 38:45.240
I found it in the bins
out the back.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.600
Steadman?

38:53.680 --> 38:55.000
Nicotine poison.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
I want a lawyer.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.720
I couldn't agree more.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.320
Because I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.040
So why you arrest him, Chief?

39:12.120 --> 39:14.800
We've found some rather
incriminating evidence, Dwayne.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.600
-I'll check it
for his prints, sir.
-JACK: Hmm.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.520
But while the physical evidence
is damning,

39:19.600 --> 39:21.960
we still have no idea
what his motive is.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.920
Dwayne, any joy getting hold
of Wallace Miller?

39:24.400 --> 39:25.600
Okay, so,

39:25.680 --> 39:27.880
I tried all the usual routes
in the US, you know.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.640
IRS, benefit agencies,
healthcare.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.880
And he does not show up
anywhere on their radar.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.000
-Nothing at all?
-Nope.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.760
So I checked
with the immigration

39:36.840 --> 39:39.880
and the reason Wallace
doesn't show up anywhere
on the records in the US

39:39.960 --> 39:41.640
is because he was never there.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.320
Well, then,
why did Steadman write letters
claiming he was with him?

39:44.400 --> 39:46.120
Then I checked to see
what evidence there was

39:46.200 --> 39:47.800
of him staying here
on the island.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.880
-And?
-Nothing.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.200
No sign of
any financial activity,

39:52.280 --> 39:55.000
rent payments or bank accounts.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.520
As far as Saint Marie
is concerned,

39:56.600 --> 40:00.480
Wallace Miller hasn't existed
for the past 35 years.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.760
So, if Wallace never left
the island for the US,

40:03.840 --> 40:05.240
but he isn't here, either,

40:06.040 --> 40:07.080
where is he?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.400
Someone stops existing,

40:10.160 --> 40:11.920
goes off the radar,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.120
then it's either because
they've done something very bad

40:14.200 --> 40:15.840
and don't want to be found...

40:15.920 --> 40:17.600
But Wallace never
had a police record.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.000
Exactly.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.280
Or, it's because they're dead.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.920
You think
Wallace Miller is dead?

40:24.000 --> 40:25.520
It's possible.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.160
Well, as Steadman
claims in his letters

40:27.240 --> 40:29.440
that Wallace was there
with him in America,

40:29.520 --> 40:31.720
when we know for definite
that he wasn't,

40:31.800 --> 40:34.360
well then, that looks
an awful lot like Steadman

40:34.440 --> 40:35.760
was covering up Wallace's death.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.120
But why would he do that?

40:37.200 --> 40:39.480
He'd do it if he was somehow
involved in causing it.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.280
So where's the body?

40:41.360 --> 40:43.560
Well, it's just a hunch,
but I'd say somewhere

40:43.640 --> 40:46.680
buried in the grounds
of Steadman's old house
in Saint Boulestre.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.440
That's why Steadman was there
a few days ago.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.280
That's why he came
back to Saint Marie.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.600
And if he found out
his old village was
being redeveloped,

40:53.680 --> 40:55.320
then he's know the body
could be discovered.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.600
So he went to the village to
retrieve the body and move it.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.960
And that's exactly
what he would've done had it
not been for the security guard.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.320
Call the Commissioner.
We need to go back
to Saint Boulestre.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.720
You are certain there's a body?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.120
100%, sir.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.960
Maybe 90.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.800
Seventy-five. Until we find it,
I can't be certain of anything.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.480
But it's just
that hunch, you know?

41:21.840 --> 41:25.320
Okay, team. Let's see
if we can find any sign of where
the body might be buried.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.200
Raised ground,
loose concrete, anything.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.840
Inspector,

41:36.040 --> 41:37.840
tell me,

41:37.920 --> 41:40.000
why would Steadman
kill his friend?

41:40.080 --> 41:43.480
Wallace Miller didn't approve
of Steadman's relationship
with Fabienne.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.360
-Because?
-Well...

41:45.440 --> 41:47.080
I think because

41:47.160 --> 41:49.320
he knew Fabienne's heart
would be broken.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.320
And Steadman's gay,

41:51.400 --> 41:54.600
so perhaps Wallace threatened
to expose his friend's secret.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.520
So they argued and things
got out of hand?

41:57.600 --> 41:59.280
And next thing, Wallace is dead.

41:59.360 --> 42:02.920
But why kill Fabienne
all these years later?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.160
(SIGHS) I don't know how, but I
think she discovered the truth.

42:06.240 --> 42:08.120
Somehow, she worked it out.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.960
Now, we have evidence
she went to his villa

42:10.040 --> 42:13.680
and I think she went there
to confront him about
what he did to Wallace.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.760
We'd need to fly in the radar
equipment from Guadeloupe,

42:16.840 --> 42:19.240
along with a team to operate it,

42:19.320 --> 42:22.360
all because you are 75% certain

42:22.440 --> 42:26.520
that a crime was maybe committed
over 35 years ago,

42:27.480 --> 42:30.120
because you have a hunch?

42:31.680 --> 42:32.840
(SIGHS)

42:38.400 --> 42:40.760
-Okay.
-Please, sir.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.160
If Wallace Miller
is buried here,
he deserves to be given...

42:43.920 --> 42:45.560
-What?
-I said yes.

get here until the weekend.

needing them, sir.

43:55.320 --> 43:56.840
or blows to the head.

43:56.920 --> 43:59.120
So we were right. We cracked it.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.880
However, the pathologist
carrying out
the initial investigation

44:02.960 --> 44:05.680
using the dental records
of Wallace Miller

44:05.760 --> 44:08.840
informed me that
the remains found are
not those of Wallace Miller.

44:10.720 --> 44:13.560
Consult missing person files,
see if there's a match.

44:13.640 --> 44:17.000
As of 4:32 pm, we have
a John Doe on our hands.

44:17.080 --> 44:18.080
But it doesn't make any sense.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.880
It has to be Wallace, er,

44:20.960 --> 44:22.120
I mean, who else could it be?

44:22.880 --> 44:25.040
I suggest we all go home.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.200
Regroup tomorrow.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.040
No, we need to
check the body again.

44:28.120 --> 44:30.040
It's a mistake. It has to be.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.880
Inspector, there is no mistake.

44:32.960 --> 44:35.520
Even if it was Wallace, it still
wouldn't make any sense.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.920
-Why not?
-Because

44:37.000 --> 44:39.840
if Fabienne confronted Steadman
about killing Wallace,

44:39.920 --> 44:42.880
why would she then want
to be healed by a man
she believed to be a murderer?

44:45.800 --> 44:47.760
Go home, sleep,

44:47.840 --> 44:49.160
start again with a clear head.

44:50.320 --> 44:51.280
Yes, Commissioner.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.880
I'll head off now.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.000
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

44:55.080 --> 44:56.440
You should do the same.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.760
JACK: It must have been added
directly before Fabienne
sipped from it.

45:07.840 --> 45:11.760
Dashel brought Fabienne to see
us the day before yesterday.

45:11.840 --> 45:14.080
FLORENCE: "Marrying Steadman
will be a dream come true."

45:14.160 --> 45:16.560
SELWYN: The remains found
are not those
of Wallace Miller.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.400
You're absolutely right!

45:19.480 --> 45:22.080
Why would Fabienne allow herself
to be healed

45:22.160 --> 45:24.200
by a man she believed
to be a murderer?

45:24.280 --> 45:26.480
That's what you said, sir,
and you were right.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.960
Why would she go
to a faith healer she
knew was a killer?

45:29.040 --> 45:30.960
Why? Sir, I could kiss you.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.840
But I won't. Dwayne, JP,
we need to find a pathologist.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.360
She needs to recheck the
dental records of the John Doe.

45:36.440 --> 45:39.000
Inspector, I told you,
the pathologist is certain

45:39.080 --> 45:41.040
the body is not
that of Wallace Miller.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.760
And so am I! I know exactly
who the John Doe is

45:43.840 --> 45:45.080
and I know who murdered him.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.240
(BLOWS)

45:58.320 --> 46:02.560
(SIGHS) You know,
a lot of what we do
as detectives is based on faith.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.000
Only, we call it something
different. We call it instinct.

46:05.080 --> 46:08.960
That thing that you
can't quite explain,
but you're sure is true.

46:09.040 --> 46:12.320
Now, my instincts
were telling me for a long time
during this case

46:12.400 --> 46:14.400
that Steadman here
had to be our killer.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.400
But would someone
really commit murder

46:16.480 --> 46:18.400
in front of a marquee
full of witnesses?

46:18.480 --> 46:22.080
Hmm, and as far as
we could tell, Steadman
had no motive to kill Fabienne.

46:22.160 --> 46:23.680
So how could it be him?

46:23.760 --> 46:27.760
In the end, it turned out
it wasn't Steadman
who poisoned Fabienne.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.160
Was it you, Dashel?

46:29.240 --> 46:31.400
You're the one who
inherited Fabienne's estate.

46:31.480 --> 46:32.720
And you sure
could use the money.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.440
Or was it you, Amelia?

46:35.520 --> 46:38.600
You're clearly very protective
of your business partner.

46:38.680 --> 46:40.960
We now know
it was neither of you.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.800
Simple fact is that no one
murdered Fabienne Jordan.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.400
She took her own life.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.680
When Fabienne entered
this marquee three days ago,

46:52.760 --> 46:54.640
she did so knowing
she was going to die.

46:54.720 --> 46:59.040
In her handbag, she was carrying
a capsule of nicotine poison.

46:59.120 --> 47:02.560
JACK: I imagine
with the crowd's attention
on Steadman,

47:02.640 --> 47:06.200
no one noticed that she slipped
the capsule into her mouth.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.880
And as she was
taken up onto the stage,

47:08.960 --> 47:11.920
she let the capsule dissolve,
release its contents.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.440
Then, when Steadman gave her
the water to sip,

47:15.520 --> 47:18.560
she let the poison rinse from
her mouth out into the cup.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.920
And back again,
before swallowing it.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.680
So when we tested the water
in the cup, we'd find traces
of the nicotine

47:26.760 --> 47:29.360
and assume the poison
was put there by the killer.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.480
And as no one
else touched the cup,

47:31.560 --> 47:34.240
we assumed that only Steadman
could've put the poison there.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.840
But why would she kill herself?

47:35.920 --> 47:38.240
And why would she make it look
like Steadman had done it?

47:38.320 --> 47:41.720
Because she knew this man's
deep dark secret, didn't she?

47:41.800 --> 47:45.240
The man sitting here before me
is not Steadman King.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.200
These are the dental records

47:49.280 --> 47:51.440
from a body that we discovered
this afternoon

47:51.520 --> 47:54.200
buried in the garden
of Steadman's old house.

47:54.280 --> 47:56.120
-Who is it?
-Steadman King.

47:57.960 --> 48:00.360
This man here,
sitting before me,

48:00.440 --> 48:02.400
is actually called
Wallace Miller.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.680
-Who?
-I don't understand.

48:05.760 --> 48:09.440
Wallace Miller was
a school friend of both
Fabienne and Steadman.

48:09.520 --> 48:12.640
And when Steadman left
for America all those years ago,

48:12.720 --> 48:15.920
Fabienne was under
the impression that Wallace
went with him.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.440
But that's not the case, is it?

48:17.520 --> 48:18.880
Steadman never left the island.

48:18.960 --> 48:21.160
How could he?
When he was already dead?

48:22.720 --> 48:24.680
So what happened
all those years ago?

48:24.760 --> 48:28.680
Well, we know that Fabienne
was madly in love with
the real Steadman King.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.320
They'd just got engaged.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.920
We also know that Wallace Miller
didn't approve of
the relationship.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.200
So what was it, Wallace?

48:35.280 --> 48:36.240
Were you jealous?

48:37.360 --> 48:39.000
Were you in love with Steadman?

48:43.680 --> 48:44.720
We were close.

48:46.640 --> 48:48.200
He was handsome, funny.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.800
Charismatic, confident.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.360
And I fell for him

48:55.880 --> 48:57.200
so completely.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.040
The night before he was due
to leave for America,

49:03.800 --> 49:04.880
I told him how I felt.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.440
How much I loved him.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.600
And he told me
in no uncertain terms

49:12.400 --> 49:13.560
it couldn't work.

49:13.640 --> 49:14.840
JACK: Leaving you hurt.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.080
Humiliated, I imagine.

49:19.720 --> 49:20.760
He was walking away.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.680
Saying

49:23.760 --> 49:25.440
it was better if we didn't
see each other again.

49:27.240 --> 49:28.280
And I, er...

49:29.680 --> 49:31.040
I just snapped.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.200
I pushed him
and he fell down the stairs.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.520
He just lay there.

49:38.560 --> 49:39.920
I knew straight away
he was dead.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.520
I had killed him.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.680
Steadman had already
packed for his trip.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.600
I saw the case.

49:53.320 --> 49:54.760
His passport.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.680
And you realised
you could escape.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.880
If you became,

49:58.960 --> 50:01.760
if you actually became
Steadman King.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.840
You could leave the island
and start a new life.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.160
So you buried him in the yard.

50:07.240 --> 50:10.440
And then you went and got on
the plane in his place.

50:10.520 --> 50:13.760
They say if you tell a lie
often enough,
you start to believe it.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.280
Is that what happened
to you, Wallace, over the years?

50:16.360 --> 50:18.560
You forgot who you were.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.000
You genuinely believed
you were Steadman.

50:21.080 --> 50:25.680
Until a few weeks ago
when you found out your
old village was to be demolished

50:25.760 --> 50:28.080
and Steadman's body
would be found,

50:28.160 --> 50:31.400
forcing you to come back
to Saint Marie with
the sole purpose

50:31.480 --> 50:34.400
of moving the body
and reburying it.

50:34.480 --> 50:36.240
JACK:
The one problem was Fabienne,

50:36.320 --> 50:38.480
when she recognised
you as an imposter.

50:38.560 --> 50:41.520
I have a feeling that you knew
she was losing
her sight, otherwise,

50:41.600 --> 50:44.200
why take the risk of returning
to your home island?

50:44.280 --> 50:45.440
She wrote to me two years ago.

50:47.040 --> 50:48.720
Told me about her illness.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.280
Asked for my help at that time.

50:52.360 --> 50:53.480
I ignored the letter.

50:54.960 --> 50:57.760
But when I realised
I'd have to return...

50:57.840 --> 50:59.880
You knew her eyesight
was failing

50:59.960 --> 51:01.600
and it was unlikely that she'd
recognise you.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.360
But she, she worked it out,
didn't she?

51:04.440 --> 51:07.680
Fabienne's vision may well
have been deteriorating

51:07.760 --> 51:10.440
but she realised that the man
in front of her was not Steadman

51:10.520 --> 51:12.200
but Wallace Miller.

51:12.280 --> 51:15.200
And once she knew that, well,
I think she figured out
what happened.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.360
You killed the only man
that she ever loved.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.880
And she realised
all that she'd lost.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.200
Her future husband, children,

51:24.400 --> 51:26.640
any chance of happiness,

51:26.720 --> 51:28.120
you'd taken all
that away from her.

51:29.520 --> 51:32.360
So she came to see you,
didn't she?

51:32.440 --> 51:35.400
I assume that's why we found
a sweet wrapper at your house.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.640
JACK: And she confronted you.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.960
WALLACE:
She came straight out with it.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.560
Accused me of killing Steadman.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.000
But I denied it.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.920
Told her no one
would believe her.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.280
They'd laugh in her face,
this mad old woman

51:52.360 --> 51:53.520
slandering a man of God.

51:55.160 --> 51:57.640
I... I thought I'd succeeded.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.040
Clearly, I was wrong.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.920
And there and then,
she decided that you must pay.

52:05.200 --> 52:07.000
So, meticulously

52:07.080 --> 52:08.880
she started to
leave a trail of evidence

52:08.960 --> 52:10.920
that would lead
all the way back to you.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.040
She must have smelt
the cigarettes off you.

52:13.120 --> 52:15.840
And that's what
gave her the idea
for the nicotine poison.

52:17.080 --> 52:19.320
So, she bought tobacco
and boiled it down.

52:21.040 --> 52:23.200
We knew she was on medication
for her illness.

52:23.280 --> 52:25.960
So she emptied a capsule,

52:26.040 --> 52:29.560
filling it with the now deadly
nicotine syrup.

52:29.640 --> 52:32.040
Then she put more of the poison
in the bottle with
your prints on it

52:32.920 --> 52:34.320
and put it your bin.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.320
The evidence she planted

52:37.400 --> 52:40.440
would point to him, would
point to you as the killer.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.640
Punishment for murdering
the man she loved.

52:43.480 --> 52:45.400
The perfect plan.

52:45.480 --> 52:48.400
Apart from the fact
that the one thing that we
couldn't find was a motive.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.520
I mean, why kill
a woman after decades?

52:50.600 --> 52:54.600
But we trusted our instincts
that our prime suspect
was a guilty man.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.600
And we were proven right.

52:56.680 --> 53:00.760
Only it turns out, well,
he was guilty of
a different murder,

53:00.840 --> 53:02.520
one committed 35 years ago.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.040
And Fabienne took her own life
to get justice.

53:07.120 --> 53:09.360
The last piece of the jigsaw.

53:09.440 --> 53:12.280
We know that your aunt Fabienne
had a benign brain tumour.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.040
What we didn't realise,
until we checked her
medical records,

53:15.120 --> 53:17.160
was that this tumour
had turned malignant.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.920
It was now inoperable.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.720
So killing herself
was a way of...
(INHALES SHARPLY)

53:20.800 --> 53:22.440
Well, it was a way of hurrying
up her imminent death.

53:23.920 --> 53:27.480
Fabienne took her own life
to avenge Steadman's murder.

53:27.560 --> 53:30.280
Now, of course, she couldn't
guarantee as
a result of her actions

53:30.360 --> 53:32.120
that Wallace Miller
would be arrested

53:32.200 --> 53:34.640
or that we would
get to the bottom of it all.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.800
But she took a risk
that it would.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.480
She had faith

53:38.560 --> 53:41.960
that her actions would lead
to justice being done.

53:42.040 --> 53:44.320
And that faith, I'm glad to say,
has paid off.

53:46.040 --> 53:48.080
Wallace Miller,

53:48.160 --> 53:50.560
I'm arresting you for the murder
of Steadman King.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.200
Oh, my God.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.240
JP: Stand up.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.600
Well, we did it.
Two murders in one.

54:04.680 --> 54:06.600
Well, we couldn't have
done it without Pico.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.360
Oh, yes, on that subject...

54:08.440 --> 54:09.640
Sir?

54:09.720 --> 54:12.080
So, the Commissioner
had a quick word before we left.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.960
Turns out he assumed
the addition of a dog

54:14.040 --> 54:16.280
would be classed as an increase
in staff numbers,

54:16.360 --> 54:18.480
which in turn would entitle
the department

54:18.560 --> 54:20.560
-to an increase in funding.
-And it doesn't?

54:20.640 --> 54:23.640
Seems the funding council
don't class dogs as detectives.

54:24.240 --> 54:25.280
Sorry, fella.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.000
Ah.

54:28.080 --> 54:30.720
It's not going to be the same
without you, boy. (CHUCKLES)

54:30.800 --> 54:33.240
Are you okay
to finish up here, JP?

54:33.320 --> 54:35.120
Yeah, sure. Everything okay?

54:35.880 --> 54:37.760
No, but I hope it will be.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.560
Oh.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.640
(SIGHS)

55:04.000 --> 55:05.840
Darlene, you need an apology.

55:07.240 --> 55:08.880
I need to apologise.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.480
Okay, look.

55:12.560 --> 55:15.800
I was playing it cool,
which was a big mistake.

55:15.880 --> 55:18.200
So I'd like another chance
to make it right

55:18.280 --> 55:20.560
before things get too serious
between you and Gerald.

55:22.480 --> 55:25.120
Well, how about it?

55:25.200 --> 55:27.640
The relationship between
me and Gerald

55:27.720 --> 55:29.480
is already very
well-established.

55:32.360 --> 55:35.200
-He's my brother.
-What? You led me
to believe that...

55:35.280 --> 55:37.720
To teach you a lesson,
Dwayne Myers.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.400
You see, I don't do cool.
I do grown-up.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.840
So, apology accepted.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.600
(CHUCKLES AND GASPS)

55:47.440 --> 55:49.840
One more chance.

55:49.920 --> 55:52.520
You step out of line,
you're out on your backside.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.480
Got it?

55:55.240 --> 55:56.360
Got it.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.920
Yeah, I found it
in the "for sale" section

56:09.000 --> 56:11.280
in the back of
the Saint Marie Times.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.760
It's a bit dusty. I think
its best days are behind us.

56:13.840 --> 56:16.400
The turntable turns
and the speakers speak.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.480
The fella selling it threw in
a few records as well.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.920
Mmm, yes, I can tell, sir.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.600
There's some great ones here.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.680
Your choice, JP.
Bung one on there.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.640
(SIGHS)

56:27.000 --> 56:28.360
Well, you were right.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.600
A home's not a home until
you've made it your own.

56:30.680 --> 56:32.680
-Thanks for the advice.
-Any time, sir.

56:32.760 --> 56:34.000
(SIGHS)

56:34.080 --> 56:35.400
(REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)

56:36.080 --> 56:38.320
Good call, JP.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.000
I'd like to make a toast.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.680
To the simple things in life,
good music, good friends.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.520
Hmm. Yes.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.760
So, fancy a dance?

56:46.840 --> 56:48.200
Not in the slightest, Florence.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.000
We've got this lovely view,
cold beers in our hands,

56:51.080 --> 56:53.800
why spoil it all with
unnecessary physical activity?

56:53.880 --> 56:55.480
Whatever you say, sir.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.920
(FLORENCE GIGGLES)

57:11.280 --> 57:12.800
JACK: Who is this Baron fella?

57:12.880 --> 57:15.200
WOMAN: He is the master
of the dead during Fête Mouri.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.000
JACK: Can we help you at all?
MAN: It's my wife.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.640
Something's happened to her.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.440
JACK: Everything okay?
You look haunted.

57:20.520 --> 57:23.240
It's Darlene.
She's got her niece staying
with her for the whole week.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.280
I imagine you might prefer
something a little stronger.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.360
Yes, I think I rather would.
Do you mind?

57:27.440 --> 57:29.280
You make it sound so sordid.

57:29.360 --> 57:31.000
You're sure this
is what you saw?

57:31.080 --> 57:32.680
He's definitely a bit green
around the hills.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.440
DWAYNE: Isn't he supposed
to be that colour?

57:34.520 --> 57:35.800
Being he's a lizard?
