WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.612
<i>The weather reports were grim.</i>

00:03.655 --> 00:06.702
<i>But we had a more dire
prognostication to deal with...</i>

00:06.745 --> 00:08.269
<i>The apocalypse.</i>

00:08.312 --> 00:10.923
<i>Brought about by</i> <i>
one Percival Pickens.</i>

00:10.967 --> 00:14.318
<i>Maybe unavoidable,</i> <i>
but we had to try.</i>

00:14.362 --> 00:17.408
I'm thinking
we stage a coup.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.584
Percival manipulated his way
onto the Council,

00:19.628 --> 00:22.022
and he's using it
as a soapbox, platform.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.197
So, why don't we
just knock him off it?

00:23.240 --> 00:25.416
And... and what, we take over?

00:25.460 --> 00:26.939
I mean, why not?

00:26.983 --> 00:28.811
What if the council
refuses to step down?

00:28.854 --> 00:32.293
Okay. If we are seriously going
to attempt a "coup de town,"

00:32.336 --> 00:34.164
then we need to get
public support.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.427
Veronica, Reggie, Toni, Fangs, Cheryl...

00:36.471 --> 00:39.865
Kevin, too. I don't think
he's gone over completely
to the dark side yet.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.129
Let's reach out to folks
and host a meeting.

00:42.172 --> 00:43.652
We can do it
at Pop's.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.436
Tonight, after nightfall.

00:50.354 --> 00:53.749
They're holding a secret
meeting at the diner tonight.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.621
They're planning on
overthrowing the Council

00:56.665 --> 00:59.015
and appointing themselves
the new town leaders.

01:01.496 --> 01:04.020
I'm tired, Alice.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.935
I'm tired of these agitators.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.632
I couldn't agree more.

01:07.676 --> 01:08.981
But I have an idea.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.941
So, the RIVW weather girl
is out sick,

01:11.984 --> 01:16.206
and she has been going
on and on about this
fog rolling in.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.034
Calling it "The Wrath of God."

01:18.078 --> 01:20.515
Maybe we use it
to our advantage.

01:20.558 --> 01:24.823
Stop the meeting from happening
and give you time
to make your next move.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.308
<i>Attention, Riverdale,</i>

01:31.352 --> 01:33.832
<i>this is Alice Cooper,</i> <i>
coming to you with an</i> <i>
emergency weather warning.</i>

01:33.876 --> 01:37.227
<i>A large, dense, slow-moving fog</i>

01:37.271 --> 01:42.058
<i>is rolling into Riverdale</i> <i>
and the surrounding areas</i> <i>
later today.</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:46.758
<i>Meteorologists are likening it</i> <i>
to the great fog of 1922,</i>

01:46.802 --> 01:50.153
<i>which enveloped our town</i> <i>
100 years ago.</i>

01:50.197 --> 01:53.722
<i>So, due to imminent power</i> <i>
outages and hazardous</i> <i>
driving conditions,</i>

01:53.765 --> 01:56.028
<i>at sundown tonight...</i>

01:56.072 --> 01:59.293
<i>...the town council</i> <i>
has instituted a curfew</i> <i>
for all of its citizens</i>

01:59.336 --> 02:02.209
<i>to stay home</i> <i>
until the fog clears.</i>

02:02.252 --> 02:04.211
<i>Close your windows and vents.</i>

02:04.254 --> 02:05.995
<i>Bring your pets indoors.</i>

02:06.038 --> 02:09.085
<i>And hold your loved ones close.</i>

02:09.129 --> 02:11.131
<i>The fog is coming.</i>

02:16.092 --> 02:18.050
The casino is
a ghost town, Jay.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.401
Where are all my customers?

02:20.444 --> 02:22.142
<i>It's this fog</i> <i>
that's rolling in.</i>

02:22.185 --> 02:24.187
<i>It's keeping people at home.</i>

02:24.231 --> 02:26.015
I see.

02:28.496 --> 02:32.326
In that case,
let's just close up shop
and send everyone home.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.458
I'll lock up when I leave
for my meeting later.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.981
<i>Understood, Ms. Lodge.</i>

02:49.517 --> 02:52.215
Agent Cooper,
I just got word.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.956
The Trash Bag Killer.

02:53.999 --> 02:56.437
There's a woman who escaped
from him just like you.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.047
Okay, I wanna talk to her now.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.580
Hey, Kev. What are you
doing tonight?

03:09.624 --> 03:11.626
I guess going to the meeting
that Archie called.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.193
Even though
you're Team Percival?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.892
But putting all of that aside,

03:16.935 --> 03:20.678
how about you come over for
dinner tonight with Fangs and I
before the meeting

03:20.722 --> 03:22.811
so we can talk about
Baby Anthony's future?

03:22.854 --> 03:26.249
Just us, no lawyers.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.947
Toni, you and Fangs
are Serpents.

03:28.991 --> 03:32.516
I don't think you can
provide a safe environment
for Baby Anthony.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.736
What else is there
to talk about?

03:34.779 --> 03:37.826
How about
your compulsive cruising?

03:37.869 --> 03:41.482
Look, I'm all
for sex positivity, Kev,
but you, my friend,

03:41.525 --> 03:44.659
are addicted
to putting yourself
in risky sexual situations

03:44.702 --> 03:47.052
that often end in violence.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.751
So I'm not really sure
you're the person
that should be arbitrating

03:49.794 --> 03:51.013
the future of our son.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.451
6:30 sound good?

04:05.506 --> 04:06.507
Mumsie?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.945
- What are you doing here?
- Dear child...

04:10.859 --> 04:12.034
may I come in?

04:19.215 --> 04:21.652
After you banished me
from Thornhill,

04:21.696 --> 04:24.699
I traveled the world
searching for sanctuary

04:24.742 --> 04:27.963
and eventually found myself
in the Himalayas.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.879
At the original convent
of the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.707
You've got to be kidding me.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.535
I presented myself
on their doorstep

04:34.578 --> 04:37.842
with nothing
but the clothes on my back.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.583
And now the sisters
have decided

04:39.627 --> 04:42.934
that I can pledge myself
fully to Christ.

04:42.978 --> 04:46.242
You're telling me they're
letting an ex-dominatrix,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.809
convicted felon,

04:47.852 --> 04:50.072
serial killer
join their convent?

04:50.115 --> 04:52.335
The sisters believe
in redemption, Cheryl.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.337
They've given me one weekend

04:54.381 --> 04:57.688
to attend to
any unfinished business

04:57.732 --> 04:59.734
before I take my final vows.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.434
You are my unfinished
business, Cheryl.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.829
Speak plainly, Mother.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.353
I have a surprise for you.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.051
Something that I would
like to give you.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.271
But first,
I would love a hot bath.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.621
And a warm, scrumptious meal.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.104
Mother...

05:22.147 --> 05:25.368
Every time you come back
into my life, you gaslight me.

05:25.412 --> 05:28.415
I understand
your skepticism, Cheryl.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.331
But every word
that I've said is true.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.377
Yes, fine.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.553
You can stay for supper...

05:36.597 --> 05:39.426
- Sister Blossom.
- Thank you, child.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.427
Bless you.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.085
<i>Looks like we don't</i> <i>
have to kick people out.</i>

05:47.129 --> 05:51.176
I guess Alice's doom-saying
about all this fog
means no one is out and about.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.919
Probably for the best.

05:54.963 --> 05:58.575
Hey, while we're waiting
on everyone, I, uh...

05:58.619 --> 06:02.449
I've been wanting to talk
to you about something
I've been kinda obsessed with.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.451
Sure. What's up?

06:05.974 --> 06:07.192
You can time travel now.

06:09.020 --> 06:12.067
In an extremely limited way.

06:12.110 --> 06:16.463
Only alone, and only within
spitting distance of Pop's.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.856
I was thinking that you could

06:18.900 --> 06:22.251
stop that bomb from going off
at Archie's house.

06:22.294 --> 06:25.907
If it doesn't go off,
then I don't lose my hearing,
and I... I really...

06:25.950 --> 06:28.170
I really wanna hear again.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.346
Not thoughts, like a...

06:30.390 --> 06:31.869
like a clock ticking,

06:31.913 --> 06:34.524
- or burgers sizzling.
- Jug, I'm...

06:34.568 --> 06:35.786
I'm sorry, but...

06:36.874 --> 06:37.701
I've tried.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.791
The bomb is a fixed point
in time.

06:40.835 --> 06:44.708
No matter what I do,
it always explodes.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.493
Well, can you get me
out of the garage, at least?

06:47.494 --> 06:50.497
It's too risky.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.673
There are too many variables.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.197
Temporal paradoxes,
ripple effects.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.375
No, yeah.
No, I know. I just...

06:59.419 --> 07:01.333
thought I'd give it
my best shot, you know?

07:57.259 --> 07:58.521
Okay.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.131
Well, be safe over there.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.307
Okay, bye.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.006
That was Tabitha.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.747
The whole town's
freaking out about this fog,

08:06.790 --> 08:08.183
so we're gonna
postpone the meeting

08:08.226 --> 08:09.358
until it clears up.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.968
Why did you come
through the back?

08:11.012 --> 08:12.753
Because there's a creeper
standing outside my house.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.539
- Right now? Should I go out?
- Mmm-hmm. No.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.541
It could be anyone.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.369
Betty, I'm invulnerable.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.589
Well, it could be someone
with palladium, okay?

08:22.632 --> 08:24.721
So, please don't.
Let's just...

08:24.765 --> 08:28.072
let's just stay inside
until the fog lifts, okay?

08:28.899 --> 08:30.379
Okay.

08:30.422 --> 08:31.598
Yeah, you're right.
We're good right here.

08:40.694 --> 08:46.438
<i>♪ The darkened skyline</i> <i>
Outside my room ♪</i>

08:46.482 --> 08:50.747
<i>♪ A kingdom</i> <i>
That I gave up too soon ♪</i>

08:50.791 --> 08:52.183
<i>♪ To be with you</i>

08:52.227 --> 08:55.056
<i>♪ Won't bring me down</i>

09:01.062 --> 09:02.890
What are we doing, Arch?

09:05.153 --> 09:06.502
Are we dating?

09:07.982 --> 09:10.201
I mean,
I'm not seeing anyone else.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.377
And I love when we're together.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.945
Just feels right, you know?

09:14.989 --> 09:17.469
And I'm glad you feel that way
because, um...

09:19.254 --> 09:21.735
I'm late.

09:21.778 --> 09:25.390
My period is two weeks late,
and I'm never late. Like, ever.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.872
Oh.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.787
I mean, we're always safe.
Right?

09:30.831 --> 09:33.181
Well, yeah. Except for
that one time when--

09:33.224 --> 09:35.096
Right.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.924
And you're not
on birth control?

09:38.229 --> 09:41.189
No, I stopped taking it when...

09:41.232 --> 09:43.408
TBK had me in that well,

09:43.452 --> 09:45.846
and I just never started it
back up again.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.761
Not to blame this on TBK.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.765
My God, are you kidding me?

09:51.808 --> 09:53.897
It's okay. I have candles.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.254
No, Grandpa, we're fine.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.126
Everything is under control.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.562
Mmm-hmm.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.086
Love you too.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.968
<i>What am I gonna do</i> <i>
when I lose him?</i>

10:21.011 --> 10:22.709
Hey...

10:22.752 --> 10:26.451
Hey. Don't worry. Pop Tate
is gonna outlive all of us.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.409
What are you...

10:29.367 --> 10:30.673
You just read my mind.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.589
Oh. Yeah.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.547
Sorry, I caught a stray thought.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.332
Come on, Jughead.
We've talked about this.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.681
You can't just read my mind.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.465
It's a total invasion
of privacy.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.076
No... no, I know.

10:42.119 --> 10:45.993
I don't do it often.
I just occasionally slip up.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.342
Jughead, you read my mind

10:47.385 --> 10:48.778
every time we have
a conversation.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.562
It's the only way
we're able to communicate.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.393
That's odd.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.178
Hold that thought.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.006
- Do we still have the candles in the back?
- Yeah.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.186
How long were you with TBK?

11:06.753 --> 11:07.667
In the well?

11:10.582 --> 11:13.063
Um... two weeks.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.458
How'd you get away?

11:18.503 --> 11:19.635
You never said.

11:24.248 --> 11:28.209
TBK usually went out
every night after dark...

11:29.819 --> 11:31.865
but this one time,
it was different.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.959
We're at a crossroads,
Pretty Betty.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.615
But you get to decide

11:43.659 --> 11:45.835
how our story ends.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.360
I'm listening.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.756
I sense
we're kindred spirits.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.803
Don't you?

11:58.979 --> 12:01.416
Yes,
I feel the same way.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.813
That's why I'm giving you
this choice.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.341
Dismember this body.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.517
Prove we're kindred,

12:15.560 --> 12:18.738
and you don't go back
in the well. Ever.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.219
Refuse me...

12:23.960 --> 12:25.353
and you're next.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.314
And then what happened?

12:30.358 --> 12:32.664
He put on some classical music.

12:34.928 --> 12:40.194
<i>And he came</i> <i>
and stood behind me, close.</i>

12:40.237 --> 12:42.674
<i>And with him</i> <i>behind me like that...</i>

12:43.371 --> 12:44.241
I did it.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.984
I did what he asked me to do.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.424
I dismembered the body.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.605
And he said I could go.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.348
That's it.

13:04.392 --> 13:07.264
There's no heroic escape.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.789
He told me that he knew then,
for sure,

13:09.832 --> 13:12.313
that he and I were the same,
and that I had...

13:13.880 --> 13:16.665
I'd proven myself,
and he respected me,

13:16.708 --> 13:20.190
and the world would be
more interesting with me in it.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.107
And that this act of...

13:24.151 --> 13:26.370
dismemberment would be
our secret,

13:26.414 --> 13:28.633
binding us forever.

13:30.592 --> 13:36.206
Afterwards,
I was just different.

13:36.250 --> 13:39.644
Psychically dismembered.
Which, I guess is...

13:41.472 --> 13:44.649
- That's what he wanted.
- You're not dismembered.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.740
You did what you had to do
to survive.

13:49.741 --> 13:50.655
Maybe.

13:53.397 --> 13:54.790
You know, sometimes I wonder...

13:56.748 --> 13:58.011
Why am I still here...

13:58.925 --> 14:01.536
in Riverdale?

14:01.579 --> 14:04.104
After everything
that's happened to us,
to this town.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.282
I mean,
why not pick up stakes
and go west,

14:08.325 --> 14:11.633
or at least to some town
that's not cursed.

14:11.676 --> 14:12.634
Yeah.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.943
But then, something
always reminds me.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.338
The reason I wanna

14:21.382 --> 14:23.471
save the soul of Riverdale,

14:23.514 --> 14:25.473
the reason why I bought
my dad's house...

14:27.040 --> 14:29.781
it's not just
because I wanna live here.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.435
I wanna raise a family here.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.918
That's what I'm fighting for.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.746
So what are you saying, Arch?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.488
I'm saying...

14:40.531 --> 14:43.317
when we get that pregnancy test
at the drugstore tomorrow...

14:44.840 --> 14:47.799
whatever it says, I'm all in.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.367
Whatever you wanna do,
I'm here for you.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.940
I'm not going anywhere.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.163
Thank you.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.281
Reggie.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.980
- What's going on?
- Cleaned out my locker, gonna clean out my desk.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.026
I'd ask if you want a ride
to Archie's meeting, but--

15:40.069 --> 15:42.506
It got postponed
'cause of the fog.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.421
I know. Tabitha texted me.

15:44.465 --> 15:47.947
- Yeah, it's like a Stephen King movie out there.
- Reggie...

15:47.990 --> 15:50.427
can we at least have a drink?

15:50.471 --> 15:52.255
For old times' sake,
if nothing else?

15:52.299 --> 15:53.909
I shouldn't drink and drive.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.302
Especially in this fog.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.564
In that case...

15:57.565 --> 16:00.350
why don't you drink...

16:01.351 --> 16:02.309
and stay?

16:07.836 --> 16:09.751
- I don't wanna fight.
- So let's not.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.972
Let's play poker.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.452
I've been playing poker all day
with the wise guys
at the car lot.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.280
Well...

16:20.892 --> 16:21.981
what about

16:22.720 --> 16:23.591
strip poker?

16:25.854 --> 16:28.161
Or have you been playing that
with the wise guys too?

16:34.254 --> 16:35.951
There you go.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.693
- A sign from God.
- Or the Devil.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.566
Either way,

16:42.610 --> 16:45.656
luckily, I have a serious
penchant for DripChic candles.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.920
- Tabs?
- Yeah?

16:48.964 --> 16:50.139
Do we have any tubing?

16:51.097 --> 16:53.012
What do you need it for?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.361
I need tubes
to siphon gas from our car
for the generator.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.189
Well, yeah. We...
we have some,

16:56.232 --> 16:58.887
but Jugger, car's at the edge
of the parking lot.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.932
You won't be able to see
three feet in front of you.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.849
And what if...

17:04.893 --> 17:06.547
what if something's out there?

17:06.590 --> 17:09.376
No, no. Come on. I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

17:09.419 --> 17:12.466
Hey. When I was back there,
I saw this old ham radio.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.511
Runs on batteries.

17:14.555 --> 17:15.599
Maybe you fire it up,
see what people
are saying about the fog?

17:15.643 --> 17:17.384
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:39.406 --> 17:43.192
Oh, hell no. What are the odds?

17:43.236 --> 17:45.064
Give me those boxers, Mantle.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.937
Or if you're feeling shy...

17:49.981 --> 17:51.505
I'd settle for a kiss.

17:52.767 --> 17:53.942
Or better yet...

17:54.725 --> 17:55.552
both.

17:58.468 --> 17:59.904
Let's start with a kiss.

18:26.844 --> 18:31.588
Can we actually take this party
up to one of
the Champagne suites?

18:32.372 --> 18:33.721
Anything you want.

18:40.902 --> 18:44.993
You know, maybe we were
too hasty before.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.865
Breaking up, I mean.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.998
You're the one who ended it.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.262
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have
stolen those slot machines.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.613
But maybe, just maybe...

18:58.398 --> 19:00.008
I overreacted.

19:01.792 --> 19:02.967
The truth is...

19:04.012 --> 19:06.841
we're a good match, Reggie.

19:06.884 --> 19:11.585
And it might not be too late
to start over.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.805
I kind of like
what I'm hearing.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.938
Good, 'cause I kind of like
what I'm saying.

19:20.202 --> 19:23.858
- But if we're gonna pick up where we left off...
- Possibly.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.817
You need to get rid of
that painting of your dad.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.559
The one that's been looking
over my shoulder for months.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.127
Reggie, it's just a painting.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.825
Ronnie, we both know
it's more than just a painting.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.089
Okay.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.092
All right, fine. It's gone.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.311
Cool. Let's do it now.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.227
Now?

19:45.271 --> 19:46.881
What's the urgency?

19:46.924 --> 19:49.100
Because I don't believe
you'll do it otherwise.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.712
Come again?

19:51.755 --> 19:53.279
Like I said, Ronnie...

19:54.323 --> 19:55.498
I don't wanna fight.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.154
We're not fighting.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.678
We're having an open,
honest dialogue.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.770
What did you mean
with that snarky comment?

20:06.814 --> 20:10.209
Our whole relationship,
I've always felt like
second-fiddle to Archie.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.994
- Okay.
- And now...

20:13.037 --> 20:15.823
I'm dealing with your old man
looming over my desk?

20:15.866 --> 20:18.260
The irony.

20:18.304 --> 20:22.177
Okay, so this is the point
in the conversation
when I assure you

20:22.221 --> 20:24.353
you're not
a consolation prize, right?

20:25.180 --> 20:26.268
Guess what?

20:26.312 --> 20:28.227
I feel the same as you.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.403
If I had my druthers,

20:30.446 --> 20:33.536
I'd be living in New York,
working on Wall Street,

20:33.580 --> 20:35.712
my father would still be alive.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.888
But things didn't
pan out that way.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.022
And need I remind you

20:41.065 --> 20:44.286
I gave my own ultimatum
to Archie, once upon a time.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.550
Me or Riverdale.
And he chose Riverdale.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.944
So, the reality is...

20:49.987 --> 20:52.816
we're all someone's
consolation prize.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.122
Uh-huh.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.820
So, in your ideal world...

20:58.082 --> 20:59.693
who's with you in New York?

20:59.736 --> 21:02.391
Me or Archie?

21:02.435 --> 21:06.743
I broke up with Archie
because he wouldn't move
to New York with me.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.355
So the question is moot.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.618
Damn, Ronnie.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.924
All you had to say was,
"You, Reggie.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.710
You're the one."

21:16.753 --> 21:20.235
Okay, you know what?
Forget Archie,
forget my father.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.630
The way I see it,

21:23.673 --> 21:28.243
we're just a man and a woman
in this town,
in this room.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.028
And that is
all that matters, Reggie.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.596
Really?

21:35.381 --> 21:36.860
Because the way I see it...

21:38.688 --> 21:41.604
we're recreating
your parents' dynamic.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.090
- I am nothing like my mother.
- No, Ronnie.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.570
You're like your dad.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.790
And I'm... I'm recreating
my own parents' dynamic.

21:53.834 --> 21:57.838
My mom chose her career
over my dad every time.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.101
So it's not just
on you, Ronnie.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.191
It's on the both of us.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.641
Sometimes I've wondered if...

22:20.469 --> 22:22.819
the reason we're such
a good match is that...

22:23.994 --> 22:25.474
we're actually bad...

22:27.433 --> 22:28.912
in ways that are...

22:30.261 --> 22:31.698
simpatico.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.353
Yeah.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.398
- That's why we gotta break this screwed up--
- Toxic cycle.

22:37.573 --> 22:38.444
Yeah.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.795
For both our sakes.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.668
Fog notwithstanding?

22:45.712 --> 22:48.367
I'm starting to see...

22:49.498 --> 22:51.674
things crystal clear, finally.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.200
I'm gonna get my stuff and go.

22:57.506 --> 22:58.507
I'll see you.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.383
Shoot. I'm late.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.082
Kevin.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.477
I was hoping I'd see you.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.958
Moose, wh...
what are you doing here?

23:58.001 --> 24:01.440
Getting re-acclimated to
the old stomping grounds.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.224
I'm Riverdale High's
new P.E. teacher.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.095
I had no idea.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.490
Can we catch up?

24:08.534 --> 24:12.581
I'd love to, possibly.
But I can't. I'm...
I'm late for dinner.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.497
Well, you can't
leave right now.
It's too foggy out.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.369
Maybe we can wait
for it to lift? Together?

24:20.502 --> 24:21.938
Come on, Kev.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.898
We haven't talked, like,
really talked in forever.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.815
Fine. Yeah. Um...

24:28.858 --> 24:30.643
Just for half an hour.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.209
Because of the... the fog.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.522
Before Kevin arrives,

24:40.566 --> 24:42.437
we should probably
get on the same page
about the Serpents

24:42.481 --> 24:44.831
and how
they're going to evolve.

24:44.874 --> 24:48.008
Or not. In case he asks.

24:48.051 --> 24:51.490
I just want Anthony to be
raised the same way
that we were.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.840
You know, old-school
Serpent style.

24:53.883 --> 24:56.930
I want him to be able
to defend himself.
Fight when he needs to fight.

24:56.973 --> 24:59.106
With the Serpents by his side.

24:59.149 --> 25:01.587
- I don't want him to get killed by a Ghoulie.
- Now, first of all,

25:01.630 --> 25:03.893
don't say that out loud.

25:03.937 --> 25:06.026
And second of all,
all the Ghoulies were killed...

25:06.069 --> 25:08.419
by cops.

25:08.463 --> 25:12.423
If Baby Anthony was gonna be
a gang member, he'd be in
constant danger from cops.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.077
Well, you know he's gonna face

25:14.121 --> 25:17.646
the same kind of harassment
as a political activist.

25:17.690 --> 25:20.083
Or whatever you want
the "Sweetwater" Serpents
to be.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.477
Well, less so, I would say.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.480
But clearly we're not gonna
see eye-to-eye on that, so...

25:25.524 --> 25:28.701
Maybe, when Kevin gets here,
we don't focus on the Serpents.

25:28.744 --> 25:33.749
Instead, we appeal to him
as a compassionate human being.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.404
And tell him we want to avoid

25:36.447 --> 25:39.189
an expensive,
drawn-out legal battle.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.147
Totally.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.980
The hell? I just paid
this month's bill.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.938
It's probably the fog.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.505
I'll go get some candles.

25:52.855 --> 25:55.597
So, I'm... I'm still
teaching here. Obviously.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.687
But I'm also a part-time deputy
working with my dad.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.559
What happened to Broadway?

26:00.602 --> 26:03.039
That was a pipe dream.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.390
And you and Fangs?
You two never
got back together?

26:06.913 --> 26:08.697
No.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.525
Full disclosure
I'm in the middle
of a custody battle

26:10.569 --> 26:11.744
with him and Toni.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.183
- That's a tough situation.
- Yeah.

26:16.226 --> 26:18.141
What about you?

26:18.185 --> 26:20.622
Regale me with stories from the open road.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.406
Wish I had some.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.713
I got laid off
from the trucking company

26:24.757 --> 26:27.020
when the Lonely Highway
shut down.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.675
And my dad recently
got out of prison.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.242
So, I've been living with him,
getting him re-acclimated.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.201
And here we are...

26:35.855 --> 26:37.291
back at Riverdale High.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.554
Kevin...

26:41.077 --> 26:41.948
um...

26:42.905 --> 26:44.864
I know I bailed on you

26:44.907 --> 26:47.257
after that horrible night,
when my dad,
dressed as the Gargoyle,

26:47.301 --> 26:51.305
- came and tried to scare us while we were--
- Having sex for the first time.

26:51.348 --> 26:54.090
- Yes. I remember that.
- Yeah.

26:54.134 --> 26:54.961
Hard to forget.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.750
Traumatized me for life,
to be honest.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.448
Anyways, I've always
kind of regretted

27:04.492 --> 27:06.363
the unfinished business
between us.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.586
Which unfinished business,
specifically?

27:27.384 --> 27:29.604
- Sorry.
- No, no. It's okay. I was...

27:30.300 --> 27:31.780
feeling it, too.

27:31.824 --> 27:36.393
Um, I just need to send
a quick text to someone.

27:43.749 --> 27:47.883
"Sorry. Don't think
I can make it tonight
because of the fog.

27:47.927 --> 27:48.841
Raincheck."

27:48.884 --> 27:50.320
Raincheck!

27:52.148 --> 27:53.497
Hmm.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.064
You know, I knew.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.718
I knew he would do this.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.851
He bails on people.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.680
He bailed on our marriage,
and now he's bailing on us
as a family.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.683
- Fangs.
- And now he's suing us? For custody?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.510
Wait, why are trying
to make nice with him?

28:06.554 --> 28:09.339
For Anthony's sake, Fangs.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.646
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

28:11.690 --> 28:15.258
Where do you think I'm going?
I'm gonna handle this my way,
on my terms.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.044
Look, as good as it would feel
beating up Kevin,

28:18.087 --> 28:19.959
it's not gonna make
our problems go away.

28:25.225 --> 28:28.097
I want this settled, Toni.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.403
It will be.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.710
Soon.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.234
And if Kevin doesn't wanna
work this out between us,

28:34.277 --> 28:36.758
then we'll battle it out
in the court.

28:36.802 --> 28:39.718
And if we need to get
personal and dirty to win,

28:39.761 --> 28:41.589
we will.

28:41.632 --> 28:45.245
But I need you
here with me, Fangs.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.769
Not arrested again.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.076
Baby Anthony needs you.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.730
He needs his father.

28:53.122 --> 28:56.343
So please stay here with us?

28:57.692 --> 28:58.737
For me?

29:05.961 --> 29:07.746
Is anyone out there? Hello?

29:10.052 --> 29:11.445
[man, indistinct] <i>
...out of the house...</i>

29:13.055 --> 29:13.969
Hello?

29:14.970 --> 29:16.276
Hello? Is someone there?

29:17.930 --> 29:19.714
<i>...there's a...</i> <i>
...under the bed...</i>

29:20.584 --> 29:22.325
Do you need help? Hello?

29:27.896 --> 29:28.941
Jughead.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.734
Sorry that took so long.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.085
Oh, my God!

29:43.129 --> 29:46.001
I got turned around in the fog.

29:46.045 --> 29:49.962
- Were you just coming out to look for me?
- I was worried.

29:50.005 --> 29:53.139
- Did you get the gas?
- Yeah. Filled to the brim.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.488
Let's fire up the generator.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.627
Well, that is one way
to catch up.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.675
Yeah, feels like we're back
in sophomore year.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.071
I'm gonna go wash up,
all right? Be right back.

30:37.183 --> 30:38.401
Oh, my God!

30:39.925 --> 30:41.143
You okay?

30:41.187 --> 30:42.536
You fell asleep there
after we--

30:42.579 --> 30:43.972
Moose...

30:44.016 --> 30:45.408
Oh, my God, I thought...
Thought I saw the...

30:46.235 --> 30:48.020
What?

30:48.063 --> 30:51.675
Nothing. Never mind.
Just a dream, I guess.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.727
I'm here, Kev. I got you.

31:11.565 --> 31:14.002
Mumsie!
Dinner is served.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.399
Mumsie?

31:24.795 --> 31:26.580
Wherefore art thou, Mother?

31:28.974 --> 31:32.107
You evil wretch!

31:32.151 --> 31:34.196
- Cheryl.
- Is this why you're here?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.155
To steal Julian?

31:36.198 --> 31:37.721
I knew it.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.810
Who sent you? Was it Percival?

31:39.854 --> 31:42.552
Or did Abigail herself
summon you?

31:42.596 --> 31:46.208
I'm merely re-acquainting
myself with Thornhill.

31:46.252 --> 31:51.387
I can't believe
you kept this old doll
all these years.

31:51.431 --> 31:54.434
And I can't believe I let you
back into this house
and my life again.

31:54.477 --> 31:55.914
What are you doing?

31:55.957 --> 31:57.437
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.275
- Wha...
- Okay.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.755
Okay.

32:24.725 --> 32:25.944
Oh...

32:28.250 --> 32:29.512
Welcome back, Mumsie.

32:30.861 --> 32:33.908
Tell me,
do you feel that?

32:33.952 --> 32:36.389
Do you feel yourself
getting hotter?

32:36.432 --> 32:38.173
Cheryl, what are you doing?

32:38.217 --> 32:40.219
I'm making your
body temperature rise.

32:41.394 --> 32:44.049
Right now, you're at about 112.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.530
122.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.359
140.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.492
How are you doing this?

32:52.535 --> 32:53.841
I'm pyrokinetic.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.411
But you...

32:58.454 --> 33:01.980
You couldn't come back
and just be a normal mother,
could you?

33:02.023 --> 33:04.591
No.

33:04.634 --> 33:08.029
You're still your usual
gaslighting, manipulative self.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.378
As you'll always be.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.686
But...

33:12.729 --> 33:14.253
things have changed.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.778
I have changed.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.957
For the longest time,
you were the dragon
and I was the maiden.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.306
Locked away in the tower.

33:26.265 --> 33:29.094
But now I am both.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.533
The maiden and the dragon.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.709
And you are going to feel
my fiery wrath.

33:35.752 --> 33:38.494
Please, Cheryl,
don't do this.

33:38.538 --> 33:41.280
I... I have something for you.

33:41.323 --> 33:42.846
A surprise.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.761
- Or did you forget?
- It's too late, Mumsie.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.677
They're letters from Heather.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.900
What do you mean,
"Letters from Heather"?

33:52.943 --> 33:55.381
You remember Heather?

33:55.424 --> 33:58.862
Your best friend
from junior high?

33:58.906 --> 34:03.084
After she moved away,
she wrote you almost every day.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.826
Of course I remember Heather.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.871
You caught us in my bedroom
and called us "deviants"

34:07.915 --> 34:10.091
and forbade her
from ever speaking to me again.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.745
Well, she wrote you.

34:11.788 --> 34:14.008
And I intercepted
those letters.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.576
And I kept them,
all these years.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.535
Please, Cheryl.

34:19.579 --> 34:22.190
The letters are
my peace offering to you.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.323
Proof, I hope,

34:24.366 --> 34:27.108
that I truly have changed.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.370
You must read them.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.810
So where are they, Mother?

34:33.854 --> 34:36.987
And may Mephistopheles
have mercy on your soul
if you're lying to me.

34:41.992 --> 34:45.866
To anyone who can hear me, this is Tabitha Tate,

34:45.909 --> 34:48.477
broadcasting live
from Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe,

34:48.521 --> 34:51.872
exit 17,
off of the Lonely Highway.

34:51.915 --> 34:56.268
If you're lost in the fog,
look for the Pop's sign.
We're open.

34:56.311 --> 35:00.098
We have power, food, heat,
running water.

35:01.925 --> 35:04.624
Just look for the light.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.467
Garden rose tea to soothe you.

35:23.730 --> 35:28.082
All these years, I always
wondered why I never
heard from Heather.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.171
Did you really
hate me that much?

35:32.347 --> 35:34.132
Why?

35:34.175 --> 35:38.005
Why are you so cruel
to me, Mother?

35:38.048 --> 35:39.876
Oh, my beautiful child.

35:41.617 --> 35:45.360
I suppose I recognized in you
something that I had

35:45.404 --> 35:49.277
tried so very hard to kill
within myself.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.673
Because I felt like a monster.

35:56.023 --> 35:56.980
Oh.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.199
I'm so, so sorry.

36:01.985 --> 36:05.032
Tomorrow, when the fog lifts,

36:05.075 --> 36:06.381
I'll also be gone.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.036
But before I go,

36:09.079 --> 36:10.864
please forgive me, Cheryl.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.736
Forgive me my trespasses.

36:15.608 --> 36:16.783
I beg of you.

36:27.359 --> 36:30.623
<i>By morning,</i> <i>
the fog had completely</i> <i>
dissipated...</i>

36:30.666 --> 36:32.886
<i>bestowing upon some of us</i> <i>
a sense of clarity.</i>

36:34.148 --> 36:35.758
Hey, Fangs. It's Kev.

36:35.802 --> 36:38.021
Listen, sorry I didn't
make it last night.

36:38.065 --> 36:41.895
<i>I was just calling to say</i> <i>
that after a night</i> <i>
of reflection</i>

36:41.938 --> 36:43.418
and taking stock,

36:43.462 --> 36:46.726
if you and Toni wanna discuss
joint custody,

36:46.769 --> 36:49.381
<i>just amongst ourselves,</i> <i>
I'd be open to that.</i>

36:49.424 --> 36:50.469
Oh.

36:50.512 --> 36:51.905
You're open to that?

36:51.948 --> 36:54.299
I am.

36:54.342 --> 36:57.389
The world's a scary place,
and there's safety in numbers.
So, I'd be willing to.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.303
Yes.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.782
Kevin...

36:59.826 --> 37:02.132
whatever epiphany
you had last night,

37:02.176 --> 37:03.917
<i>I had one, too.</i>

37:03.960 --> 37:06.224
I don't wanna be half a dad.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.226
And I want my son

37:08.269 --> 37:11.403
to be raised with an integrity
that I'm not sure
that you possess.

37:11.446 --> 37:14.710
<i>I mean, the fact that you're
even waffling about Percival--</i>

37:14.754 --> 37:15.798
That's not fair.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.322
I'll see you in court, Kevin.

37:17.365 --> 37:19.628
Until then, watch your back.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.124
Jay?

37:37.167 --> 37:40.649
Bring me some butcher paper,
string, and masking tape.

37:41.694 --> 37:44.392
I need to wrap something up.

37:52.182 --> 37:53.314
Oh, brother.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.360
Now what?

37:55.403 --> 37:58.885
<i>Welcome to</i> Riverdale Today. <i>
I am your host, Alice Cooper.</i>

37:58.928 --> 38:02.628
<i>Today, I have the pleasure</i> <i>
of chatting with Riverdale's</i> <i>
new mayor,</i>

38:02.671 --> 38:04.325
<i>Percival Pickens.</i>

38:06.109 --> 38:08.634
Alice is saying that Percival
is Riverdale's new mayor.

38:08.677 --> 38:09.939
<i>Welcome, Mr. Mayor.</i>

38:09.983 --> 38:12.333
What? How?

38:12.377 --> 38:14.814
<i>Tabitha broke it down</i> <i>
for me after the broadcast.</i>

38:14.857 --> 38:17.904
<i>Apparently, while the rest</i> <i>
of us were waiting</i> <i>
for the fog to lift,</i>

38:17.947 --> 38:21.647
<i>The Council of Four,</i> <i>
minus Tabitha, met,</i> <i>
dissolved itself,</i>

38:21.690 --> 38:23.170
<i>and appointed Percival mayor...</i>

38:23.213 --> 38:25.781
How the hell did he do this?

38:25.825 --> 38:28.436
<i>...collecting enough</i> <i>
signatures to ratify</i> <i>
the Council's endorsement.</i>

38:28.480 --> 38:31.439
So, Percival wants to be Mayor.
Like Hiram.

38:33.006 --> 38:34.790
God help us all.

38:34.834 --> 38:37.227
Mayor isn't his ultimate goal.
It's just a stepping stone.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.316
To what?

38:40.230 --> 38:42.929
All hail Dictator Pickens.

38:42.972 --> 38:47.281
<i>And thank you so much</i> <i>
for joining us and wishing</i> <i>
Riverdale a good morning.</i>

38:48.630 --> 38:49.979
Well, so much for our coup.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.635
How did we not see this coming?

38:53.679 --> 38:56.377
How do we stop this guy?

38:56.421 --> 39:00.033
Jughead, when I told you
that I couldn't stop the bomb
from going off

39:00.076 --> 39:01.382
under Archie's bed...

39:04.298 --> 39:05.299
I lied.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.171
I did stop it.

39:08.215 --> 39:11.653
And you didn't
lose your hearing.

39:11.697 --> 39:16.136
But you also didn't develop
your ability to read minds.

39:16.179 --> 39:18.530
And because of that,
Percival won.

39:18.573 --> 39:22.142
Nuclear winter in every
scenario that I played out.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.013
Every scenario?

39:24.057 --> 39:26.625
How many did you see?

39:26.668 --> 39:29.279
One-thousand-
three-hundred-eighty-four.

39:32.065 --> 39:35.155
All of our powers play
a part in the final battle.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.723
But yours is especially
threatening to Percival's,

39:37.766 --> 39:39.202
because it's
the closest to his.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.117
He can control minds,
you can read them.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.858
You're on the same continuum.

39:42.902 --> 39:45.948
Okay, so we don't go back
in time to stop the bomb. I...

39:45.992 --> 39:47.428
I get it. I'll accept it.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.520
There's something else.

39:52.564 --> 39:56.829
What you overheard me
thinking about last night,

39:56.872 --> 39:59.092
about being afraid
to lose someone...

40:01.790 --> 40:03.662
that wasn't about Pop.

40:05.664 --> 40:06.882
That was about me?

40:08.754 --> 40:11.452
In every scenario...

40:12.758 --> 40:14.542
you die.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.287
And we... we beat him?

40:21.462 --> 40:22.942
- Twice.
- Twice?

40:24.596 --> 40:27.033
Out of 1384 times?

40:28.904 --> 40:29.949
That's grim.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.909
Your death is...

40:35.433 --> 40:37.304
fixed.

40:37.347 --> 40:41.003
I have been wrestling
with whether
or not to tell you.

40:41.047 --> 40:42.440
I have been wrestling...

40:42.483 --> 40:44.485
Hey, hey.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.618
Come on.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.228
It's okay. We'll beat him.

40:51.144 --> 40:53.625
Sadly...

40:53.668 --> 40:55.670
it's not the first time
I've been destined to die.

40:55.714 --> 40:59.152
Just don't give up hope, 'cause that...

40:59.195 --> 41:00.370
that would kill me.

41:03.243 --> 41:04.592
- Okay.
- Come on.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.170
What a surreal
24 hours.

41:17.213 --> 41:19.085
Yeah,
what a surreal year.

41:21.348 --> 41:24.307
But, Betty, this could finally
be some good news for us.

41:26.092 --> 41:29.530
And no matter what,
like I said, I'm here.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.227
Feeling closer to you
than I ever have.

41:37.146 --> 41:38.060
You ready?

41:41.542 --> 41:42.587
Come on.
