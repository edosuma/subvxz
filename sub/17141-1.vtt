Hey, guys.
It's me, Miranda.

00:08.551 --> 00:10.553
I'm from Tacoma, Washington.

00:10.636 --> 00:15.057
I'm a singer, dancer, actress, et cetera.
[chuckles]

00:15.140 --> 00:16.934
So I thought I'd post this video
to YouTube

00:17.017 --> 00:19.311
to show everyone how good I am. So...

00:20.103 --> 00:21.689
That's what I'm doing.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.900
So, anyways,
I'm gonna sing a song for you guys now

00:24.983 --> 00:26.484
and I hope you like it.

Would it make you feel better
if we watch your video?

06:15.417 --> 06:16.751
Yes, that will...

Yes, that will make me feel

-Okay, thank you.

[softly] Ow.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.036
-[Miranda] Mom, where's my breakfast?
-Oh!

06:51.119 --> 06:54.206
Um... [stuttering]
I'm nuking it right now, honey.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.291
[whispering] Shoot, shoot, shoot!

07:01.504 --> 07:04.257
-Okay.
-[Miranda] What is this?

07:04.341 --> 07:06.009
This still has the plastic on it.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.261
Oh, it's just hard for me to grip.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.680
You just have to poke it with a fork.
Is that so hard?

07:10.763 --> 07:11.764
Okay, okay.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.146
Ah! The steam shot out.
It almost burned me.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.982
-Thanks a lot, Mom.
-I'm sorry.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.900
Hey, I have... I have some news.
Look, look, look.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.819
I graded your quiz from yesterday,

07:24.902 --> 07:27.114
and you're doing
so much better this semester.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.281
A-plus.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.367
Last time you gave me three pluses.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.244
-Is this some kind of joke?
-No.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.996
What happened
to the other pluses, Bethany?

07:34.079 --> 07:36.248
Learn how to grade papers
next time, Mom. Okay?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.749
[Bethany] Okay, all right.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.667
Oh, the cream shot out
of my package. Sorry.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.794
Oh, that's all right.
It landed on my buns.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.171
I like 'em extra sticky.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.215
Mmm. Well, if you squeeze harder,
more will come out.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.466
-Oh, good idea.
-Yeah.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.218
-[Bethany] Hey, hey, hey, you guys.
-All at once.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.719
Guys, guys.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.472
I just think you need to be careful,
talking like that.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.931
What are you talking about?

07:54.016 --> 07:56.643
Well, people could get the wrong idea.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.562
And what idea is that, Bethany?
That we like breakfast?

07:59.646 --> 08:01.689
It just so happens that breakfast

08:01.773 --> 08:04.276
is one of the most important
meals of the day.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.362
And if you don't think so,
I don't want to be part of this family.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.240
Okay, Jim.
Breakfast is important, I misspoke.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.824
[Jim] Damn right,
that breakfast is important.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.410
Watch your language in this house.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.952
You're dang right, it's important.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.579
No, no, Miranda.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.790
Miranda, you need to leave some
for your sister, please.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.209
[sighs] Oh!
I wish I was an only child.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.378
Aw, thanks, Miranda.
I love you, too.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.006
[Miranda] Emily, listen, I am starving.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.507
All I've had to eat today

08:27.590 --> 08:30.177
is a couple of sticky buns,
lots of extra cream,

08:30.260 --> 08:32.636
a popsicle and a bag of salami.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.097
What am I supposed to do?

08:34.181 --> 08:37.017
-What is a bag of salami?
-[Bethany] Emily...

08:37.683 --> 08:39.394
you know what a bag of salami is.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.938
Don't play dumb,
we all know what a bag of salami is.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.818
Anyway, have you guys noticed the lights
are actually working in this house today?

08:47.444 --> 08:48.820
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, yes.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.946
-Looks great.
-Look at that.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.031
That's... wow!

08:51.114 --> 08:53.658
Do you maybe know why that is?
Any guess?

08:53.741 --> 08:56.828
Yeah. God. "Let there be light."
Don't you read the Bible?

08:56.911 --> 09:00.373
Okay, what actually happened
is no one paid the bill, so I had to.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.461
Emily, I... have been busy.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.504
I have been very busy.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.590
So, you were promoted to manager?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.092
Uh, assistant manager.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.677
And no, I didn't get the promotion
to assistant manager,

09:12.760 --> 09:15.805
but thank you for reminding me
that I am not an assistant manager.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.934
Emily, it's like you don't have
a sensitivity... meter.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.853
-Is it a meter?
-Yes, it's a meter.

09:21.936 --> 09:25.273
-It's a meter and she's missing it.
-You're missing your sensitivity meter.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.444
Okay, so far,
this breakfast has been a disaster.

09:29.527 --> 09:33.490
But I have an announcement that
might make things a little better.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.032
[clearing throat]

09:35.658 --> 09:40.788

to being very famous.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.290
-[Bethany gasps]
-[Emily] Okay, well...

09:42.374 --> 09:44.876
I'm gonna let you deal with this
and I'm gonna go to school.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.253
-Okay, all right.
-[Jim] Just go to school.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.879
-Love you guys. Bye.
-[Bethany] Okay, bye. Love you.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.631
[Emily] Bye.
[Jim] Now... [clearing throat]

09:49.714 --> 09:51.091
These are very exciting times

09:51.174 --> 09:54.386
because I have just uploaded
Miranda's very first video...

09:54.469 --> 09:57.680
to the World Wide Web.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.141
To Miranda.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.685
-To me. Thank you.
-Oh... But is the Web necessary?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.479
Yes, Mom.
The Internet is necessary.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.649
All the most famous people in the world
started off on the Internet.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.901
Justin Bieber, Susan Boyle,

10:09.984 --> 10:11.778
that cat that fell off the table
when it got scared.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.530
I think you're better
than all those people.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.242
-And the cat?
-Is she not better than the cat?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.536
-Yeah, Mom, you left out the cat.
-What cat?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.496
I am done with this breakfast

10:21.579 --> 10:25.583
and I'm gonna go check
to see if we have had any views.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.920
[sighs]

10:30.922 --> 10:35.009
And, honey, I want you to know,
that even if no one watches your videos,

10:35.092 --> 10:38.054
that I am proud of you and I love you,
no matter what.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.642
What do you mean,
if no one watches my video?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.145
Are you kidding me?
You're the worst mom ever.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.689
[Bethany] Oh...
[Jim] Oh, oh, oh, it's happening.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.857
-It's happening!
-[Bethany] What? What?

10:49.941 --> 10:51.067
What is happening?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.569
[Jim] Hurry, it's happening!

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
[Bethany] What is happening?
[Jim] Right now. Right now.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.656
-Forty-three views.
-[Miranda] Oh, my gosh.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.783

Fifty-two views!

11:11.213 --> 11:12.839
That's practically everyone there is.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.924
Miranda, your video has gone viral.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.760
Oh, no. Viral? Sweetie, I'm sorry.
Why would you say that to her?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.512
No, it is a good thing.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.389
Oh, it's a good thing.
You're gonna be fine.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.476
Going viral is Internet slang for famous.
This is great.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.854
Now that you have a fan base,
you need to build on this success.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.566
You need to nurture them,
make the fans think that you care.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.611
You want to know the secret
to a successful viral video?

11:34.694 --> 11:37.029
You don't stop
until you've transmitted that virus

11:37.113 --> 11:39.616
to every single one of your fans.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.784
-Sounds fun.
-[softly] It is fun.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.620
[whispering]
What are you guys talking about?

11:45.330 --> 11:46.789
So, are we going to your house
this weekend?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.541
I can't. My parents wanna sit down
and have dinner

11:48.625 --> 11:50.001
where we all talk to each other.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.919
Wow.
How do you survive in that family?

11:52.003 --> 11:53.880
-Yeah, that's, like, super weird.
-[Miranda] Hello.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.048
You look like you wanna meet me.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.216
-It's a meet and greet, right now.
-Oh, God!

11:57.300 --> 11:59.218
There might be some confusion
about when it is. It's now.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.803
-[girl 1] Who is that?
-You guys can come say hi.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.514
Hello, you're here for the meet and greet.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.890
-Welcome. Did you want a picture?
-[girl 2] What?

12:03.973 --> 12:07.394
Uh, nothing. Nothing.
I just forgot something, so...

12:07.477 --> 12:10.980

I will catch up with you guys later.

-Miranda, what are you doing?
-I'm meeting my fans.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.115
-Have a headshot.
-Your fans? What fans?

12:21.198 --> 12:23.951
I have a YouTube video now.
It's online. Hello?

12:24.035 --> 12:25.161
-Here you go.
-YouTube?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.705

Yes, it's on YouTube and it's viral, so...
Celebrity.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.337
Great. That's really great for you.
I just... You know, Miranda,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.673
I just don't think that the kids
at my school are really, you know,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.716
ready for someone like you.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.427
Everyone at my school saw it
and loved it.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.387
You're home schooled.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.931
Okay, you know what? Free headshots.
Right now, everybody!

12:45.014 --> 12:46.308
-Two for one.
-Miranda, stop!

12:46.391 --> 12:47.725
You are making a scene!

12:47.809 --> 12:49.727
That's right, Miranda.
I'm the one making the scene.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.228
Oh, I'd be happy
to take a photo with you.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.606
-Get away, freak.
-Okay, make sure to tag me in that.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.149
I know you want to. [chuckles]

12:55.232 --> 12:57.527
Okay, you have to go home
and take down that video, right now.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.904
Yeah, right!
That video is catapulting my career

12:59.987 --> 13:01.781
and it's gonna change everything.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.951
-[school bell ringing]
-[Miranda] Oh.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.035
Don't worry, everybody.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.454
I'll be back tomorrow
for another meet and greet.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.414
Same time, same place.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.752
Oh, just so you know,
your sign says "great."

13:14.836 --> 13:16.338
Thank you.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.065
[cash register beeping]

13:37.191 --> 13:40.487
Actually, you know what?
Can you get the heavy items for me?

13:40.570 --> 13:41.738
'Cause my fibro...

13:42.864 --> 13:44.491
...myalgia.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.243
I have undiagnosed fibromyalgia.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.745
[sighs] It's such a burden.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.457
Can you please get the big ones?

13:53.332 --> 13:56.378
You know what? I'm gonna actually
need you to scan 'em for me.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.756
You need to bend over and slide...
Thank you.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.550
Thank you so much.
You're such a good helper.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.427
Actually, you know what?
My manager is right over there,

14:04.511 --> 14:07.430
so if you... if you wouldn't mind,
just don't squish the bread.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.515
Thank you.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.891
-You squished the--
-[Emily] Excuse me.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.268
-I'm sorry. Mom.
-Yes, what? What are you doing here?

14:12.351 --> 14:13.978
Miranda showed up at my school today.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.397
Oh, dear.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.189
I got her to leave,
but she said she's coming back,

14:17.273 --> 14:19.651
so I think we just need to
deal with this whole YouTube thing

14:19.734 --> 14:20.818
before it gets way out of hand.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.739
Okay, well, I'm on it.
I'm making her a YouTube award. Right?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.198
Then she'll think she won YouTube

14:26.282 --> 14:28.325
and she'll stop making videos
or something.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.120
No. No, that's just gonna
encourage her, Mom.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.541
Someone needs to be honest with her
and tell her that she's got no talent.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.044
[sighs] Oh, God.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.754
You're right.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.005
When are you gonna tell her?

14:42.799 --> 14:43.883
You have to tell her.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.343
You're the mom.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.846
Well, I can't tell her.
She won't like it.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.767
So you're totally unwilling to tell her
anything that she doesn't want to hear?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.186
I know.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.195
[gasps]

15:14.205 --> 15:15.707
-Did you see it?
-Yeah.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.291
I got my first fan mail.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.587
I know. "Keep trying," right?
Everything is going exactly as planned.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.004
Probably got more,
I just haven't checked yet.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.590
Ooh, scooch, scooch!

15:23.673 --> 15:26.676
The floodgates are open,
let's watch the love roll in.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.472
-Oh, no.
-What?

15:30.555 --> 15:31.556
That!

15:32.765 --> 15:35.142
"You suck.
Don't make any more videos."

15:35.226 --> 15:37.604
What?
What's that supposed to mean?

15:37.687 --> 15:40.440
Okay, I could be misinterpreting this,

15:40.523 --> 15:44.360
but I think he thinks that you should stop
making videos, and that you suck.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.112
-[scoffs]
-You... you should reply.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.615
Yeah, okay. "Or what?"

15:52.869 --> 15:55.830
[scoffs]
"Are you threatening me?"

15:58.708 --> 15:59.792
[gasps]

16:00.710 --> 16:02.378
I got a death threat.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.715
He could be out there right now
watching me, waiting to attack!

16:05.798 --> 16:08.510
Miranda, I know this is scary,
but it comes with the territory!

16:08.593 --> 16:11.471
A death threat is just a subset
of phase one.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.222
It means my plan is working.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.642
I can't believe this is happening to me.
I'm gonna die!

16:15.725 --> 16:17.143
You need to build me a panic room.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.353
I need security at all times,
and I need a body double!

16:19.436 --> 16:21.022
-[sobbing]
-Miranda, just calm down!

16:21.105 --> 16:22.690
You are perfectly safe!

16:22.774 --> 16:24.817
I have locked every door in this house!

16:24.901 --> 16:27.444
-No one is getting in!
-Okay...

16:27.529 --> 16:28.946
-Ahh, Patrick!
-[Jim] How did you get in?

16:29.030 --> 16:30.532
-The back door was open.
-Dang it!

16:30.615 --> 16:32.992
I came as soon as I read the hate comment.
Are you okay?

16:33.075 --> 16:35.369
No, I'm not okay!
I just got a death threat.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.705
-Mom, what do you want?
-What? I made snacks.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.874
Snacks? How can you cook wieners
at a time like this?

16:39.957 --> 16:41.584
-There's a killer on the loose.
-What?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.460
Yes, I just got a death threat. Look!

16:43.545 --> 16:45.838
Oh, honey, are you serious?
[gasping]

16:45.922 --> 16:47.048
Miranda, "You suck..." [gasps]

16:47.131 --> 16:49.759
Oh, honey, that's so vile.
I can't say it out loud.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.969
Oh, honey, I just don't think
they mean it, sweetie.

16:52.053 --> 16:55.557
What, are you saying I'm wrong?
You're taking their side, Mom? Really?

16:55.640 --> 16:58.976
No! No, I mean, it's a...
it's a very scary death threat, okay?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.186
Here, have a wiener.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.647
No, I can't eat that!
What if someone poisoned it?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.406
-Safe.
-Oh, thank God.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.534
Hey, what are you doing?

17:14.617 --> 17:16.993
You only have to eat enough
to see if it kills you.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.579
Don't be greedy, Patrick.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.789
Nice try, Patrick.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.083
God, I'm so stressed.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.126
I'm stress-eating wieners!

17:24.210 --> 17:25.795
Look, just relax, okay?

17:25.877 --> 17:29.549
We'll just lay low on the Internet
and move on to phase two.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.926
Phase two?
I can't go on television right now.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.302
There's a killer on the loose.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.346
Miranda, we'll take every precaution
to keep you safe.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.640
But we need to strike
while the iron is hot.

17:37.724 --> 17:42.729
We have to turn your Internet presence
into television stardom.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.022
Jim, how are you gonna get Miranda on TV?

17:45.106 --> 17:47.274
Easy.
We'll get her a commercial.

17:47.358 --> 17:51.320
Miranda should be the spokesperson
for an up-and-coming local business,

17:51.403 --> 17:54.406
and it just so happens
that I have a great deal of influence

17:54.490 --> 17:57.076
at our neighborhood fish store.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.627
Jim, I told you, you can't shoot
a commercial in here, dude.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.087
Don't worry about it.
It's gonna be great.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.881
Well, did you feed the guppies?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.382
No, I didn't feed the guppies.
I'll do it after.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.593
And what about the filters
I told you to change?

18:13.676 --> 18:15.845
-You get to those?
-Nope, I did not.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.972
Have you done your job,
like, at all today, dude?

18:18.055 --> 18:21.475
You see that camera? These lights?
They didn't set themselves up.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.685
I've been busy.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.064
-[door chimes]
-Is it safe for me to come in?

18:27.148 --> 18:28.941
Miranda, you're here.
Just in time.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.193
Interior looks all clear.
I'll secure the perimeter.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.237
-Okay.
-Maybe we should've just stayed home.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.406
No, Mom, you need to put up
these posters that I made, okay?

18:35.489 --> 18:37.366
I want everyone
on the lookout for the hater.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.451
Oh, honey, I don't think
he actually looks like this.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.453
Yes, he does.
That's his profile photo, Mom.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.205
God, you obviously know nothing
about the Internet.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.791
I don't.
I don't know the Internet.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.542
[Miranda] God! Why don't you
stop being a smart Alex

18:46.626 --> 18:47.794
and put those up?
Thank you very much!

18:47.877 --> 18:49.754
Unless you'd rather do nothing
and watch me get killed.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.255
No, I don't wanna watch you get killed.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.340
Then why won't you just
put them up like a good girl?

18:53.424 --> 18:55.927
-[stutters] I will!
-Thank you.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.387
Okay, can we hurry this up, please?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.722
I don't wanna be
in one place for too long.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.848
That's when you become a target.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.767
Okay, well, uh...

19:02.850 --> 19:05.352
having said that,
we just have to wait till 3:00,

19:05.436 --> 19:08.147
when my other actor gets here,
which should be just a minute.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.606
Okay, why can't I play both parts?

19:09.691 --> 19:12.318
Well, his part doesn't have any lines.
You don't wanna do that.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.444
Ew.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.737
And here he is.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.072
[Patrick grunting]

19:20.201 --> 19:21.535
[Phil] I'm a delivery man.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.623
[door chimes]

19:26.708 --> 19:28.167
[Jim] Hey, Phil.
[Phil] Hey, guys.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.877
Pretty tight security
out there today, huh?

19:29.961 --> 19:31.253
Mmm-hmm.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.505
I think one sword is probably enough, huh?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.675
[Jim] Uh, I don't know about that.

19:35.758 --> 19:40.304
I think... two swords is, uh,
more what you need.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.598
All righty.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.767
Well, have a good one.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.436
Wait. Phil, I have
one more delivery for you.

19:47.519 --> 19:53.359
Uh, would you just deliver this fish
right here to that girl right there?

19:58.740 --> 20:00.032
[Jim] Yeah.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.452
Yeah. Wait till I say action.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.371
And action.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.084
-I'm supposed to give this to you.
-Oh, whoa!

20:10.167 --> 20:12.086
This is not a speaking role.
Why is he talking?

20:12.169 --> 20:15.715
She's right. Cut.
Phil, no talking, all right?

20:15.798 --> 20:16.966
Deliver that fish again.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.844
And... action.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.388
Wait. Okay.

20:24.098 --> 20:27.894
Oh, what a beautiful fish you're buying,
and at such a competitive price.

20:27.977 --> 20:31.063
And guess what?
One thing that's even great about it,

20:31.147 --> 20:33.858
-it's only 99 cents.
-[Jim] And cut.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.777
Miranda, perfect.

20:35.860 --> 20:39.113
Phil, you have to stand
like a normal human being.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.073
Yeah, I noticed that.
It was really distracting.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.199
[Jim] Who stands like that?

20:42.283 --> 20:44.535
I know.
He's, like, pudgy, it's weird.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.245
And back to one.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.206
And... action.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.877
And go. And act. Go.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.005
[cell phone vibrating]

21:00.927 --> 21:03.888
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hey, Emily, listen.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.681
I need you to do me a favor.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.935
I want you to go in my bathroom,
and get my new wrist brace, okay?

21:09.018 --> 21:10.227
It's on my vanity.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.147
It's the fancy one.
It's got, you know, leopard print.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.816
What's wrong with the one
that you're wearing?

21:14.899 --> 21:17.819
This is my casual brace, okay?

21:17.902 --> 21:19.403
[softly] I need my seductive one.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.950
Mom, you're not even injured.
You don't even need the brace.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.243
All right.
You know what, Emily?

21:26.327 --> 21:29.371
You're such a fun-stopper.
You sound just like my doctors.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.832
Can you just bring me the brace?

21:30.915 --> 21:32.374
Like, when do I ask you to do anything?

21:32.458 --> 21:33.876
Thank you.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.588
[whispers] Okay.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.882
[door chimes]

21:39.966 --> 21:44.470
Couple of customers tried to get in.
But don't worry, I stopped them.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.639
Aw, dude, come on, man.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.765
What's wrong with the fish?

21:48.850 --> 21:50.101
What?

21:51.435 --> 21:52.644
Well...

21:54.105 --> 21:56.773
I think the lights heated up the, uh...
the water, yeah.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.154
-[stammers] Yeah, they're dead.
-[clerk] Oh, Jesus.

22:03.530 --> 22:04.531
They're all dead.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.244
Oh, so?
They'll be easier to take care of.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.412
No. No, no, no.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.040
You can't shoot
a fish store commercial with...

22:13.124 --> 22:14.291
dead fish everywhere.

22:15.001 --> 22:19.213
I mean, it's an interesting choice,
but it... it just doesn't work.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.757
It doesn't work! Just... everyone...

22:21.841 --> 22:24.343
Remain calm.
Just remain calm!

22:24.426 --> 22:27.221
Come on, Patrick, we just have to
make these fish look like they're alive.

22:27.304 --> 22:30.599
We just gotta weigh them down
with gravel so they'll sink.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.602
Just a little bit. Come on.
Help me, Patrick. Get in there!

22:33.685 --> 22:37.481
[Patrick] In their mouth?
[Jim] Put the gravel in their mouths!

22:37.564 --> 22:39.775
Okay, let's see what you did.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.860
No!

22:41.944 --> 22:45.656
[gasps] Patrick, you have
the wrong fish-to-gravel ratio.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.200
That's an absurd amount of gravel
to put in there, Patrick.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.701
I'm sorry, I haven't practiced this.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.246
-This one's alive.
-Oh, my God, stop talking!

22:52.329 --> 22:53.747
Oh, Emily!
Thank God you're here.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.249
I need you to be my body double

22:55.332 --> 22:57.334
and go outside so the killer gets you
instead of me.

22:58.002 --> 23:01.047
As awesome as that sounds,
I have to go help Mom hit on a guy.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.632
What? Selfish!

23:03.715 --> 23:06.343
Give it to me, give it to me.
All right, so...

23:06.427 --> 23:09.388
[breathes deeply]
How do I look?

23:09.471 --> 23:11.390
-Pitiful.
-Perfect.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.185
[Jim] Oh, God.
Why won't these dead fish swim?

23:14.268 --> 23:15.937
Okay, next plan.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.814
We're gonna tape the fish
to the outside of the tank.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.358
That way, it'll look like
they're floating on camera.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.110
-Tape. Tape.
-We're gonna tape the fish.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.071
-Dad's gonna be here any minute.
-Oh, my gosh!

23:25.154 --> 23:26.280
You guys, we're running out of time.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.781
Mom, just push the button, please.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.575
Okay.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.327
[groans softly] Ow!

23:31.410 --> 23:34.496
Oh, what a beautiful fish,
and at such a competitive price.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.207
We've got guppies. We've got--

23:36.290 --> 23:38.834
Just, everyone act like
there's not a lot of dead fish.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.129
[Patrick] Okay.
[Jim] Tape the fish to the tank.

23:42.213 --> 23:44.966
[Patrick] Is this...
Does that look real?

23:45.049 --> 23:47.301
[Jim] Oh, my gosh!
On camera, this will look better

23:47.384 --> 23:49.720
than if they were actually swimming.

23:49.803 --> 23:54.100
Let's keep it up. Let's tape all the fish
to the outside of the tanks!

23:54.183 --> 23:56.685
-Just dry a fish and then tape a fish.
-[Miranda talking indistinctly]

23:56.768 --> 23:59.021
[Jim] Just dry a fish
and then you tape the fish.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.983
Just dry it and then tape it.
Just dry it and then tape it.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.276
-Dad's here.
-Oh, hey, boss.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.988
There's, uh, nothing to see here.
It's just a normal day at work.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.447
That's all it is. [shudders]

24:08.530 --> 24:11.033
-What did you do to my fish?
-[Miranda] ...we got 'em.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.376
That's the hater.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.044
That's the guy who wants to kill me!

24:22.794 --> 24:23.962
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.714
Patrick, no!
Patrick, put the sword away.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.716
Emily, what are you doing?
Get out of the way! Patrick!

24:27.799 --> 24:28.800
-Get him!
-[Emily] Don't do it!

24:32.721 --> 24:34.431
[both yelling]

24:34.515 --> 24:36.058
He's not the hater.
He's not the hater. I am.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.062
[store owner breathing heavily]

24:43.940 --> 24:45.901
-I wrote the comment.
-What?

24:46.985 --> 24:48.195
Why?

24:48.279 --> 24:50.281
Because you are embarrassing.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.522
[knocking on door]

25:24.856 --> 25:26.150
[Emily] Miranda?

25:29.236 --> 25:30.654
Miranda, I'm sorry.

25:31.863 --> 25:35.326
Okay, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
or scare you. I was just...

25:37.703 --> 25:40.206
I was just embarrassed, and...

25:40.289 --> 25:44.085
You know, I thought if I posted
a mean comment that you would stop.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.297
That doesn't even make any sense.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.258
Why would you be embarrassed?

25:54.178 --> 25:55.512
Because...

25:55.596 --> 25:56.972
[sighs]

25:58.265 --> 26:00.351
I don't know. I'm... [sighs]

26:00.434 --> 26:03.520
I guess I'm just used to you
doing this stuff around the house,

26:03.604 --> 26:07.774
but now you're putting yourself out there,
and people are gonna think you're...

26:11.695 --> 26:13.905
People are gonna think you're different.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.498
I thought it was a good thing
to be different.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.708
It is, it is. It's just...

26:25.709 --> 26:29.421
It's just when you're too different,
people will be mean to you,

26:29.505 --> 26:32.090
and that doesn't just affect you
because...

26:32.174 --> 26:33.342
we're sisters.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.887
So... they'll be mean to me, too.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.765
The only person who's been mean to me
so far is you.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.811
Okay, Miranda, listen--

26:44.895 --> 26:46.062
No, Emily, you listen!

26:46.730 --> 26:49.107
I'm sick of doing performances
in the living room for Mom.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.612
She can't even clap for me anymore
'cause of her fibromynalgia.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.198
But I thought you liked doing those.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.909
I do, but for the first time ever,

26:58.992 --> 27:01.287
I found a way
to show my talent to everybody.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.206
You're not the only one
who posted a comment on there, Emily.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.292
Someone else said, "Keep trying."

27:07.501 --> 27:08.794
And I will.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.800
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

27:21.807 --> 27:22.974
How about this?

27:24.768 --> 27:27.521
I'll make sure no one ever finds out
we're related.

27:28.855 --> 27:31.149
It will be like
I don't even have a sister.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.613
You would do that for me?

27:38.240 --> 27:39.491
Of course.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.207
Thanks, Miranda.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.002
'Kay, bye.

27:56.717 --> 27:57.926
[Bethany] Okay.

27:58.552 --> 28:01.805
If you don't like it, don't tell me.
It always hurts my feelings.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.974
Mmm.
Getting fired from the fish store

28:04.057 --> 28:06.017
was the best thing
that could have happened to me,

28:06.101 --> 28:10.481
because now I'm freed up
to be Miranda's full-time manager.

28:10.564 --> 28:11.690
[Miranda chuckles]

28:11.773 --> 28:15.486
And I basically quit.
After they fired me, I said, "I quit."

28:17.363 --> 28:18.447
Do you like it?

28:18.530 --> 28:21.116
-[spitting]
-[pebbles plinking]

28:23.118 --> 28:25.287
Jim, we're at the table.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.747
There was gravel in my fish.

28:26.830 --> 28:30.292
Yeah, Mom, come on,
you should know how to cook a goldfish.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.421
[Bethany] I'm sorry.
I didn't de-gravel the goldfish.

28:36.257 --> 28:37.591
You know... [clears throat]

28:37.674 --> 28:40.677
I think you're gonna be famous in time,
and we should celebrate that.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.139
"In time"? What are you talking about?
It's happening now, Mom.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.351
Seventy-three views
is nothing to scoff at, Bethany.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.102
It's probably higher now.

28:51.313 --> 28:52.981
Whoa!
You got a bunch of more comments.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.065
I did?

28:55.191 --> 28:57.319
"No talent.
Now I have ear cancer."

28:57.403 --> 28:58.612
Emily!

28:59.238 --> 29:00.864
-[Jim and Bethany] Emily.
-I didn't...

29:00.947 --> 29:02.073
I didn't... I didn't do it.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.410
Okay, if you didn't do it,
then who would write the...

29:04.493 --> 29:06.578
They're still coming in.
"Worst singer ever"?

29:06.662 --> 29:07.663
Can someone make this stop, please?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.040
All right, Jim.
You need to do something, Jim.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.500
-I can't turn it off.
-[Miranda] Turn it off!

29:11.583 --> 29:13.627
-I can't turn it off!
-[all yelling indistinctly]

29:13.710 --> 29:16.380
-Oh!
-For Pete's sake, Jim!

29:16.463 --> 29:17.798
-Gosh!
-"You look like a potato"?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.591
-Okay, look...
-You do not look like a potato!

29:19.675 --> 29:22.469
-All right, stop looking at it.
-"You sound like you were pooing"?

29:22.553 --> 29:24.430
-Who would say that to me?
-[all yelling indistinctly]

29:24.513 --> 29:26.139
I got it. I got it. Oh!

29:26.222 --> 29:27.391
They're still coming in!

29:27.474 --> 29:28.684
[indistinct yelling continues]

29:31.353 --> 29:32.646
Turn it off!

29:32.729 --> 29:35.148
-Get out! Save yourselves!
-[all yelling]

29:36.567 --> 29:38.026
[Bethany] Oh, no!

29:38.109 --> 29:39.194
[Miranda yelps]

29:39.278 --> 29:40.279
[Jim gasps]

30:03.969 --> 30:05.971
