00:11.580 --> 00:14.140
Tonight, I point at a thing...

00:15.500 --> 00:18.420
..Richard walks through a shop

00:18.420 --> 00:20.740
and James has some bananas.

00:27.980 --> 00:31.540
Hello! Hello, everybody.
Thank you.

00:31.540 --> 00:32.820
Thank you so much.

00:34.300 --> 00:39.020
Now, every so often we like to
remind ourselves that this is

00:39.020 --> 00:40.540
a motoring show.

00:40.540 --> 00:44.860
So, we get three really nice cars
and go for a long drive.

00:44.860 --> 00:47.900
And what we do is, we take it in
turns to choose the location.

00:47.900 --> 00:52.180
So, if it's my turn,
we usually end up in France,

00:52.180 --> 00:55.180
if it is James's turn
we usually end up in...

00:55.180 --> 00:57.500
1953.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.820
Tonight, though,
it was Hammond's turn.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.260
So guess what?

01:08.140 --> 01:11.820
Our meeting point was
the Valley of Fire in Nevada.

01:16.260 --> 01:19.820
And what you see here
is the car I'll be using.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.220
This is a Lexus LFA.

01:24.220 --> 01:27.380
It's not the most powerful car
in the world, it's not the fastest,

01:27.380 --> 01:31.180
it's not the best looking
and it certainly isn't the cheapest.

01:31.180 --> 01:36.540
Plus, the Lexus badge does come
with a whiff of masonry.

01:36.540 --> 01:39.500
But I drove one of these
in England last year

01:39.500 --> 01:43.940
and I emerged from the experience
thinking, "That might very well be

01:43.940 --> 01:46.980
"the best car I've ever driven."

01:46.980 --> 01:48.500
And that's why we're here.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.220
To find out.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.860
At this point,
the stillness of the desert

01:54.860 --> 01:59.260
was shattered by the sound
of an approaching James May,

01:59.260 --> 02:03.260
who was at the wheel of the new
Aston Martin Vanquish.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.979
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.100
It's not bad, is it?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.940
This is a DBS replacement,

02:13.940 --> 02:17.700
but also a bit inspired by
the 177, million pound thing.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.460
And look at the upholstery!

02:19.460 --> 02:22.500
I know, the upholstery
is outrageous.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.380
That's the best looking Aston
there's ever been, actually.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.540
Best one they've done.

02:26.540 --> 02:29.260
That, though, cos I've never seen
one in a good colour like that,

02:29.260 --> 02:31.900
that is pretty fantastic.
No, but yours is better.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.420
And the great thing is,
I'm in the better car

02:34.420 --> 02:38.700
and I'm just going to follow you
around going, "That is beautiful."

02:38.700 --> 02:41.380
'After a bit more
mutual mastication,

02:41.380 --> 02:45.500
'we started to wonder what
Billy Bob Hammond might bring.'

02:45.500 --> 02:48.820
Will it be something subtle,
small, European?

02:49.900 --> 02:52.580
No, my money was on something
rather large,

02:52.580 --> 02:55.220
brash and maybe even American.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.620
'And blow me down, I was right.'

03:00.900 --> 03:03.460
So... The new Viper.

03:03.460 --> 03:04.740
You? Yeah.

03:04.740 --> 03:08.660
I know it looks exactly like the old
one, but that is the new Viper.

03:08.660 --> 03:11.700
Yay. Subtle.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.340
Before you two start, let me just
tell you, that 8.4 litre V10,

03:16.340 --> 03:18.980
that's the largest engine
ever fitted to any production car

03:18.980 --> 03:21.300
since the war.
And looking around here,

03:21.300 --> 03:24.300
let's not forget,
this car is the fastest,

03:24.300 --> 03:27.020
with the highest top speed,
it's the fastest to 60,

03:27.020 --> 03:28.980
the most powerful, 640bhp,

03:28.980 --> 03:32.020
it's got the most torque
and the biggest engine.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.620
I'm sorry, Hammond.
They haven't styled it.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.380
This has been in a wind tunnel
to look like this!

03:37.380 --> 03:39.260
If that's been in a wind tunnel,

03:39.260 --> 03:41.980
they parked it in there sideways
for all the good it's done.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.420
It's been in a wind tunnel.
Look at the panel gap.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.140
I'll stand behind you,
have a look at it.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.380
Let me see if I can see how many
fingers you hold up in that panel gap.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.740
There has to be a gap
between the panels or

03:51.740 --> 03:54.060
there'd be one piece!
Let's have a look at yours.

03:54.060 --> 03:57.740
That looks ridiculous. It's a Lexus.
It's just a nerd-fest. It's a Lexus.

03:57.740 --> 04:00.700
It's for rich golfers, is what it is.
I admit, the Lexus...

04:00.700 --> 04:03.740
If you want to talk about panel gap,
there's a whopper straightaway.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.980
It's a cooling system!
Is it heck, it doesn't fit.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.220
I'm surprised at you cos this is
a bunch of retro nonsense, really.

04:09.220 --> 04:11.900
No, I'm sorry, I won't have that.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.900
It's very pretty, yes,
but it's harking...

04:13.900 --> 04:15.420
It's harking back to the past

04:15.420 --> 04:18.060
and a car with an engine
from the 1930s isn't?

04:18.060 --> 04:21.820
This is a nerd-fest, that's for
old fools, that is a proper,

04:21.820 --> 04:26.020
honest Gran T... 8.4 litre V10.
You don't need it to be that big!

04:26.020 --> 04:29.580
Hang on a second. Who owns Chrysler
now, the people that made this?

04:29.580 --> 04:31.860
Fiat. What else do they make?

04:31.860 --> 04:33.380
Ferrari. There you go.

04:33.380 --> 04:36.900
But, Hammond, All-Bran is made by
the same people who make Frosties.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.340
It doesn't mean they're comparable!
That's a stupid...

04:39.340 --> 04:41.060
It's not! Right, look.

04:41.060 --> 04:44.020
I knew I would get some flak...
Shush. Shush.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.540
Instead of just standing here
arguing... Yes.

04:46.540 --> 04:49.340
..why don't we go for a drive?

04:49.340 --> 04:51.660
That's a better idea. Open the taps.

04:57.580 --> 05:00.500
'Straight away, though,
there was a problem.'

05:02.220 --> 05:05.940
Not again. Hammond, why do
you like it in America so much?

05:05.940 --> 05:09.940
Every nice piece of road
has an 8mph speed limit on it.

05:09.940 --> 05:12.700
I don't know, don't ask me,
it's not my fault.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.900
Yes, it is.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.420
I mean, what are we going to hit?

05:17.420 --> 05:20.260
What are we going to hit here?
There's nothing.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.220
No wildlife, no people.

05:23.220 --> 05:25.580
This is stupid. It's stupid!

05:27.060 --> 05:30.740
'Eventually, though,
the 35mph hour limit ended,

05:30.740 --> 05:33.220
'and thanks to some trickery
in the edit,

05:33.220 --> 05:37.980
'we were able to take our cars up
to a dizzying 55mph.'

05:50.340 --> 05:51.620
There it goes.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.700
This isn't just an engine,
it's a force of nature!

06:01.660 --> 06:04.500
Let's see what a proper V12
feels like.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.020
Nice is the answer.

06:13.940 --> 06:17.340
The engine in this is so exquisite

06:17.340 --> 06:23.220
that it revs from idle to 9,000rpm
in 0.6 of a second.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.180
In fact, it revs so fast

06:27.180 --> 06:30.060
they couldn't fit a conventional
rev counter.

06:30.060 --> 06:33.740
It had to be electronic, because
a normal one simply can't keep up.

06:37.140 --> 06:40.660
Right, let's sort something out
right from the start.

06:40.660 --> 06:44.500
James's Aston Martin costs  £190,000.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.060
Jeremy's Celica,  £340,000.

06:48.060 --> 06:51.100
This -  £75,000 or thereabouts.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.700
That is a huge difference!

06:52.700 --> 06:55.900
It does all the fancy stuff, too,
it's got all the fancy materials,

06:55.900 --> 06:59.260
carbon fibre, aluminium, magnesium -
they're all in here.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.100
'But when it comes to technology,

07:03.100 --> 07:06.900
'neither of their cars is a match
for the howling LFA.'

07:10.420 --> 07:17.340
It took five years of sweat,
toil and cash to design this car

07:17.340 --> 07:21.820
and then just before they put
it on sale, someone said,

07:21.820 --> 07:25.580
"You know, I think it would be
better if the body was made from

07:25.580 --> 07:27.900
"carbon fibre rather
than aluminium."

07:27.900 --> 07:30.780
And they began all over again.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.620
How much would that cost?!

07:34.340 --> 07:38.220
All I do know is,
they sell them for  £340,000

07:38.220 --> 07:42.220
and they lose money on every single
one that leaves the dealership.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.580
'By the time Jeremy had stopped
droning on about his Celica,

07:49.580 --> 07:51.180
'we were on a motorway

07:51.180 --> 07:54.860
'and I got the distinct impression
I was playing gooseberry.'

07:58.020 --> 08:02.100
I'd like to say that, from the back,
particularly in that colour,

08:02.100 --> 08:07.060
and in fact this light,
the LFA looks absolutely epic.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.540
I mean, seriously.

08:10.580 --> 08:12.820
Ooh, that makes a lovely sound.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.460
It makes a very nice noise,
your Aston Martin.

08:16.460 --> 08:19.020
God, why don't you two
just get a room?

08:20.180 --> 08:23.460
"Your car looks nice!"
"Your car sounds lovely." Ooh!

08:24.700 --> 08:26.620
'But they didn't get a room.

08:26.620 --> 08:30.500
'Instead, they stopped
to look at a silly aeroplane.'

08:34.940 --> 08:38.140
James? Yeah, yeah. B-2? Yeah.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.860
That's amazing, isn't it?

08:39.860 --> 08:42.620
That is a B-2 stealth bomber
coming into land at...

08:42.620 --> 08:45.060
Actually, he's turning
to come over us. Yeah.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.660
We're not supposed
to be able to see it, are we?

08:47.660 --> 08:50.420
I don't think it works!

08:52.660 --> 08:56.340
'As the sun began to set,
we were back on the road,

08:56.340 --> 08:59.020
'heading for the Las Vegas
Motor Speedway.

09:00.860 --> 09:03.980
'Here, you can drive a NASCAR
round the oval,

09:03.980 --> 09:07.380
'or you can learn the racetrack
on a Ferrari simulator

09:07.380 --> 09:11.020
'before doing it for real
in an actual Ferrari car.

09:12.380 --> 09:15.540
'But Jeremy decided
we should go to the drag strip.'

09:25.220 --> 09:27.220
God, that's loud!

09:27.220 --> 09:28.740
Argh!

09:28.740 --> 09:31.580
'We couldn't understand why,
because it just seemed to be

09:31.580 --> 09:36.020
'a lot of very noisy modified cars,
which we all hate.'

09:36.020 --> 09:38.620
Look, there's another one come in
dressed as a policeman.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.020
No, they really are police. What,
genuinely? They really... I promise.

09:42.020 --> 09:44.780
There they are, police sheriff
and the fire department.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.260
They invite kids down
to race against them

09:47.260 --> 09:49.700
to stop the kids racing
on the streets.

09:49.700 --> 09:54.140
So they race the actual police?
That was a police Mustang.

09:54.140 --> 09:58.540
They've modded, the police have
modded it and then say to kids...

09:58.540 --> 10:03.540
"What you got?" "Can you beat us?"
They actually call it Beat The Meat.

10:03.540 --> 10:07.500
No, it's probably Beat The Heat,
cos heat means... Yeah, I meant that.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.780
'To prove that modified
cars are idiotic,

10:12.780 --> 10:16.300
'Jeremy decided to take on
the local sheriff.'

10:16.300 --> 10:20.460
Yes, look, I'm up against
some crummy pickup truck.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.180
This is going to just be...

10:23.500 --> 10:25.700
..well, deeply embarrassing for him.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.500
That's there?!

10:40.020 --> 10:42.020
'After this humiliation,

10:42.020 --> 10:45.980
'I took on the state trooper
in another pickup truck.'

10:45.980 --> 10:48.300
OK, now, come on, Richard,
concentrate.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.380
Where's he gone?

11:03.540 --> 11:07.980
'Having watched the fire department's
motorcycle demolish a Honda NSX...'

11:11.340 --> 11:14.460
'..James wisely decided to take on
a youth

11:14.460 --> 11:16.780
'in a clapped-out Mitsubishi Evo.'

11:18.020 --> 11:20.140
Yes, for England!

11:21.460 --> 11:25.100
I'm going to do it in D and Sport,
I'm going to use Launch Control.

11:26.300 --> 11:29.780
Try not to look smug, James. Try not
to look smug. Practise your face.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.420
Hang on a second.

11:39.420 --> 11:42.100
All-wheel drive beats
rear-wheel drive.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.340
God, he just sodded off.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.740
Woo! >

11:45.740 --> 11:47.060
Now, come on.

11:48.900 --> 11:53.620
'Having spent the entire evening
losing to absolutely everything...'

11:53.620 --> 11:55.300
Pick on a weak one!

11:57.700 --> 11:59.660
No!

11:59.660 --> 12:03.460
'..we decided we didn't like
drag racing

12:03.460 --> 12:07.620
'and went into Las Vegas
to do strip billiards instead.'

12:17.420 --> 12:19.860
Humiliating.

12:19.860 --> 12:23.500
I can't believe, I still can't
believe that I was beaten

12:23.500 --> 12:28.180
by some bloke who had spent 1,500
quid modifying an ancient Mitsubishi.

12:28.180 --> 12:31.100
No, but the reason we hate modified
cars is cos we know,

12:31.100 --> 12:33.700
if he tried to do it again,
his engine would go "BANG!

12:33.700 --> 12:36.540
"Clatter, clatter, clatter," and
that would be end of that. True.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.340
I'll tell you what I think's funny,

12:38.340 --> 12:40.820
imagine the British police
trying to do Beat the Meat.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.500
Heat! Heat!

12:43.500 --> 12:46.260
"Right, I've tuned up
the Astra Diesel.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.260
"I might get 120 out of it
down the straight now,

12:49.260 --> 12:51.780
"who wants to take me on?"
What a spectacle.

12:51.780 --> 12:55.180
But anyway, the most important thing
is to reveal now which of the cars,

12:55.180 --> 12:57.220
our cars, was the fastest
and it was mine.

12:57.220 --> 12:59.020
Er, yours was the most expensive.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.940
It was the fastest.

13:00.940 --> 13:04.500
Listen, on paper
the Viper is the fastest.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.340
Yes, on paper,
but, Hammond, on tarmac...

13:09.140 --> 13:12.740
..mine was the... It was,
it just was. User area...

13:12.740 --> 13:17.060
Anyway, we'll pick that up later on
but now we're going to do the news.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.740
Yes, we are. I've had
another theory. Good.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.740
God. No, you love my theories.

13:21.740 --> 13:25.660
OK, this one, you know Jessops
and HMV and Woolworths and Comet,

13:25.660 --> 13:28.700
they all closed down recently?
Yeah, Jeremy, this is a car show.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.660
Yes, yes, bear with me, OK?

13:30.660 --> 13:32.220
And everyone is asking,

13:32.220 --> 13:36.940
"Why are people shopping in retail
and out-of-town centres

13:36.940 --> 13:39.540
"and town centres are just
becoming boarded-up shops

13:39.540 --> 13:43.300
"and women in short skirts vomiting
and catching herpes?" Right?

13:43.300 --> 13:46.820
There's a very good reason for this.

13:46.820 --> 13:50.540
It's cos when you go to an
out-of-town retail centre place,

13:50.540 --> 13:52.020
you can park your car.

13:52.020 --> 13:55.700
When you go into a town centre,
you can't.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.780
Right, so what are you suggesting?

13:57.780 --> 14:00.380
It's easy to fix Britain's
town centres.

14:00.380 --> 14:04.220
Rip up every double yellow line and
sack every single traffic warden.

14:07.420 --> 14:11.900
The problem is solved.
Why wouldn't you do that?

14:11.900 --> 14:13.660
Everybody's running around going,

14:13.660 --> 14:16.580
"Town centres are dying,
what should we do? It's easy!"

14:16.580 --> 14:19.540
But if you allow people to park
anywhere in the town centre,

14:19.540 --> 14:23.340
it'll become impossible to get in
or out. Rubbish! It's true.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.100
So you think parking restrictions
are just out of spite?

14:26.100 --> 14:27.860
Well, what else are they for?

14:27.860 --> 14:31.380
They go, "Hey, we did really well,
we got a  £12 revenue today

14:31.380 --> 14:34.980
"from our parking restrictions."
Meanwhile, every shop is shut.

14:34.980 --> 14:38.460
We need to have a more French
attitude to parking.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.020
Cos the rule in France is,

14:40.020 --> 14:43.140
if there is a space that a car will
go in, you put your car in it.

14:43.140 --> 14:45.860
Even if it's on a mini roundabout,
that is the rule.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.140
James, why aren't we
running the country?

14:48.140 --> 14:52.700
Why are we presenting this programme
with Noel Coward, more to the point?

14:52.700 --> 14:55.980
You were Mr Toad last week,
you really are moving around.

14:55.980 --> 14:59.020
Right, we've sorted parking. Good.
You haven't!

14:59.020 --> 15:01.740
Now, the next problem we face
and this is a big one...

15:01.740 --> 15:04.220
You know when James
is telling you something

15:04.220 --> 15:06.660
and you start to feel drowsy?
God.

15:06.660 --> 15:09.260
Yes, it's like you've had
a whole bottle of red,

15:09.260 --> 15:11.860
five portions of shepherd's pie
in front of a fire.

15:11.860 --> 15:14.380
Yeah, and it's embarrassing.
It is embarrassing.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.220
He's in the middle of a story
and you nod off. It's awkward.

15:17.220 --> 15:21.300
It is awkward. However, it's all
going to be solved with this.  £8.99.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.780
You clip it on your ear, OK?

15:23.780 --> 15:26.740
Right. Sitting still.

15:26.740 --> 15:29.780
James. Explain torque. Torque?

15:29.780 --> 15:33.380
Torque is fantastically simple, Jeremy,
it's just a force at a distance,

15:33.380 --> 15:36.740
that's why it's in pound-feet,
for example, or newton metres.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.940
It's waking me up as well,
what's the point of that?

15:41.940 --> 15:44.780
I can hear him now. It is, I'd
rather be asleep with his lectures.

15:44.780 --> 15:48.380
No, they also say it can be used
for drivers.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.540
So when you're driving you can
have it on your ear

15:50.540 --> 15:52.340
and if you nod off,
it'll wake you up.

15:52.340 --> 15:53.820
But, and you'll love this bit,

15:53.820 --> 15:57.500
it says in the blurb it could be
used by airline pilots. What?!

15:57.500 --> 16:00.700
Really? That's some comfort,
isn't it? It's reassuring, I think.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.340
Mid Atlantic, thinking, "It's OK
because the fate of me

16:03.340 --> 16:05.900
"and all these other souls
on board this jumbo jet

16:05.900 --> 16:08.460
"lie in the hands of a  £7.99..."
8.99!

16:08.460 --> 16:11.180
".. £8.99 Chinese-made ear beep."

16:11.180 --> 16:13.700
I don't actually know how much
a Boeing 747 costs,

16:13.700 --> 16:16.620
but I'm pretty sure the price
isn't something 99.

16:16.620 --> 16:19.660
But there's no component
of it that's something 99.

16:19.660 --> 16:23.060
Can you imagine if they said, "An
announcement now from the flight deck..."

16:23.060 --> 16:25.940
Argh! Wake up!

16:25.940 --> 16:28.380
Wake up! It is a stupid idea.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.180
It is a stupid idea.

16:30.180 --> 16:34.980
Now, while I was driving down here
I saw one of the new Jaguar F-types.

16:34.980 --> 16:37.460
Have you heard about this?
The new Jag small sports car.

16:37.460 --> 16:40.580
Got a picture here. It is a
beautiful looking thing. Yes.

16:40.580 --> 16:43.020
And actually, it's even better
looking from the back.

16:43.020 --> 16:45.540
I mean, that is a sensational
looking thing.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.660
But I'll tell you what surprised me
about it,

16:47.660 --> 16:50.500
is I thought it was
going to cost 40,000,

16:50.500 --> 16:53.420
the same as a Porsche Boxster
or a Mercedes SLK.

16:53.420 --> 16:57.820
It's going to cost between 60 and
80,000, and even on the top models

16:57.820 --> 17:00.860
you pay extra for heated seats
and keyless entry and so on.

17:00.860 --> 17:02.780
I'll tell you what
worries me about that.

17:02.780 --> 17:07.260
I bet they have set that up more
for handling and less for comfort.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.060
Mm. Which will be a mistake.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.780
God, it's for younger people.
That's the...

17:11.780 --> 17:13.660
It isn't! It is. It isn't!

17:13.660 --> 17:17.740
Younger people spend 150 quid
on their cars, not 80 grand.

17:17.740 --> 17:21.339
The only person who can spend 80
grand on a car is in their 50s.

17:21.339 --> 17:25.220
That car, Hammond, it is... Yeah,
well, us, but it is made for people,

17:25.220 --> 17:28.860
exclusively for people, who make
a noise when they sit down.

17:28.860 --> 17:31.460
You go to a Jag dealership to buy
that and they'll say,

17:31.460 --> 17:33.780
"Mr May, take a seat."
And you go, "Thank you.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.500
"Ahhhh. Yes!"

17:35.500 --> 17:41.020
Sold! God... That car is
for people who watch TV OR text.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.540
Not both at the same time.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.820
You do realise you two are
now officially the oldest

17:46.820 --> 17:48.100
people in the world!

17:49.580 --> 17:51.980
Hammond, we can't all be 36
forever, mate.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.220
I like it, I'm sticking with it.
Now, news from Citroen.

17:56.220 --> 17:59.460
They've developed a car
that runs on compressed air.

17:59.460 --> 18:00.980
No, I've been reading about this

18:00.980 --> 18:03.660
and I have literally
no idea how it works.

18:03.660 --> 18:06.900
I saw you reading about this
earlier on today and you know

18:06.900 --> 18:08.540
when somebody's eyes glaze?

18:08.540 --> 18:11.260
His looked like they'd been
painted on.

18:12.500 --> 18:16.700
It's undecipherable. And you could
see the words ricocheting off. Ping!

18:16.700 --> 18:19.780
They wouldn't go in, I can't work
it out. I can't work it out.

18:19.780 --> 18:21.860
It's simple. It's a bit like...

18:21.860 --> 18:23.780
Explain it to me then, James.

18:23.780 --> 18:27.700
It's like a hybrid, like a Toyota,

18:27.700 --> 18:31.020
but instead of generating electricity
under-braking when going downhill,

18:31.020 --> 18:32.580
it compresses air, which then...

18:32.580 --> 18:35.140
It wakes me as well!

18:35.140 --> 18:38.220
How does...
No, this is what I don't understand.

18:38.220 --> 18:41.180
Why don't they just put,
you know those scuba divers tanks

18:41.180 --> 18:44.220
on the back and then they shoot air
out and it'll make it go along?

18:44.220 --> 18:46.140
Because that wouldn't work.
It would!

18:46.140 --> 18:47.900
What about fire extinguishers?

18:47.900 --> 18:50.220
You put two fire extinguishers
on the boot lid,

18:50.220 --> 18:52.740
when you set them off it would
make the car move forward.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.180
Technically it would,
but it's extremely wasteful.

18:55.180 --> 18:58.900
To go round our track, you'd need a fire
extinguisher the size of Hazelmere.

18:58.900 --> 18:59.940
No, no, no.

18:59.940 --> 19:03.580
No, because fire extinguishers
are full of carbon dioxide. Yes.

19:03.580 --> 19:06.100
Well, engines produce carbon dioxide

19:06.100 --> 19:08.340
so you'd endlessly refill
the fire extinguisher.

19:08.340 --> 19:11.740
You can't use carbon dioxide
from cars to power cars.

19:11.740 --> 19:15.020
Isaac Newton said it would work.
I'm going to prove it.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.340
I'm going to prove it.

19:17.340 --> 19:20.980
What goes on...? Give me this...
Right. What goes on in his head?

19:22.660 --> 19:25.620
Move back. Move back, move back.

19:25.620 --> 19:26.860
Back!

19:29.020 --> 19:32.860
Because seriously, I'm going
to rocket across the studio floor.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.540
Are we ready, everybody?

19:35.540 --> 19:37.140
Here we go.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.620
Why's it doing this?

19:46.420 --> 19:47.900
Why is it doing that?

19:54.180 --> 19:58.780
Newton said the opposite
of any reaction... No.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.260
Every action has an equal and
opposite reaction, yes. Rubbish!

20:02.260 --> 20:05.740
Every action makes you spin
round in a lazy circle.

20:05.740 --> 20:09.380
Clever or not, you can't expect him
to have foreseen a gigantic,

20:09.380 --> 20:12.780
idiotic ape in an office chair
with a fire extinguisher, can you?

20:12.780 --> 20:14.460
Shall we move on? Yes!

20:14.460 --> 20:19.780
Because tonight we are involved in an epic drive
across the western United States in a Lexus LFA,

20:19.780 --> 20:23.020
an Aston Martin Vanquish
and the mighty Viper.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.860
Yes, and when we left the action
earlier we were with

20:25.860 --> 20:30.020
the Las Vegas Police Department,
taking part in some drag racing.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.940
The idea being that if you race on
the track, you won't feel inclined

20:33.940 --> 20:37.300
to race between the traffic lights
out on the streets.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.540
So, had it worked?

21:05.460 --> 21:07.140
Ahhhh!

21:10.460 --> 21:13.900
You know we're supposed to have got
this out of our system, don't you?

21:13.900 --> 21:16.100
We've been on the
awareness course.

21:17.700 --> 21:22.340
'A long journey lay ahead.
So, we decided to annoy Jeremy.'

21:22.340 --> 21:26.020
Just to let you know, my iPod's
working really well in the car,

21:26.020 --> 21:27.700
how about yours?

21:27.700 --> 21:30.420
No, I don't have an
iPod connector in here.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.900
I suppose, yeah,

21:32.900 --> 21:37.140
it'd be a bit much to ask for that
on a  £340,000 car, wouldn't it

21:37.140 --> 21:40.340
I would imagine it would be there,
my simple hick car has got...

21:40.340 --> 21:42.100
You can Bluetooth your iPhone to it.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.060
Jeremy, is there anything else you
haven't got that any reasonable,

21:45.060 --> 21:46.980
modern car should have?

21:46.980 --> 21:48.540
Er, not really.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.860
Don't say cup-holders.

21:51.860 --> 21:53.900
Have you got a cup-holder?

21:53.900 --> 21:56.700
No, I haven't got a cup-holder.

21:56.700 --> 21:59.220
What a tragic oversight.

21:59.220 --> 22:01.260
I think Lexus were concentrating

22:01.260 --> 22:06.340
so hard on building the perfect car,
they forgot that occasionally

22:06.340 --> 22:09.340
you might need to go somewhere
in it and need a cup-holder

22:09.340 --> 22:12.260
and an iPod connector and a seat
belt that does up more easily

22:12.260 --> 22:16.740
than this one, which doesn't do up
easily at all if you're a bit...

22:16.740 --> 22:17.780
fat.

22:17.780 --> 22:19.260
I've got a meter that tells me

22:19.260 --> 22:22.100
how much torque my engine is
producing at any given moment.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.500
Have you got one of those?

22:23.500 --> 22:27.220
I absolutely haven't got one of those
and I'm very, very pleased about it.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.260
God, Hammond,

22:28.260 --> 22:31.300
the back of your car lights up
with a stupid viper when you break.

22:33.980 --> 22:37.100
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen!

22:37.100 --> 22:39.660
That isn't just a viper,
that is a Stryker,

22:39.660 --> 22:41.460
it's the emblem of this car.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.020
I'm going to crash into
you trying to get a closer look

22:44.020 --> 22:45.540
at your novelty item.

22:49.300 --> 22:52.940
'As we cruised at a steady 55
towards California,

22:52.940 --> 22:56.460
'Jeremy discovered yet another
problem with the Lexus.'

22:57.660 --> 23:01.100
Would you mind awfully if we stopped
for petrol? I need some.

23:02.260 --> 23:04.140
I've got more than half a tank.

23:04.140 --> 23:05.500
So have I.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.460
It is quite a small tank.

23:10.420 --> 23:14.580
'In a town famous for having the
tallest thermometer in the world,

23:14.580 --> 23:17.740
'I spent three pounds filling
the Zippo in the Lexus

23:17.740 --> 23:21.100
'and then bought Hammond some fuel
for his car.'

23:21.100 --> 23:23.540
May?

23:23.540 --> 23:27.100
Yeah? This is the right fuel
for a Viper, isn't it?

23:27.100 --> 23:28.940
Looks like it. Funny

23:28.940 --> 23:31.380
- Well, we can't get it in the tank.
- Funny

23:31.380 --> 23:33.100
You know what you've done?

23:33.100 --> 23:36.020
You haven't got unleaded wood,
that's why it won't go in the slot.

23:36.020 --> 23:39.220
Is it charcoal we need? Yeah.
I'm sorry, mate.

23:39.220 --> 23:42.540
Never mind. Thank you. I'll go
and change it for some charcoal.

23:42.540 --> 23:47.180
'While I did that, Hammond kindly
solved the LFA's cup-holder problem.'

24:00.340 --> 24:01.980
They haven't put sugar in it!

24:04.380 --> 24:07.020
'After the pit stop,
the producers told us

24:07.020 --> 24:11.100
'to report to a racetrack
called Willow Springs.'

24:11.100 --> 24:15.420
Er, right. I'm going to try a sat
nav test. Here we go. Use my mouse.

24:15.420 --> 24:19.780
You actually get a mouse in one
of these. Destination, click.

24:21.380 --> 24:23.380
Apparently it's calling someone.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.060
'Lexus Inform.' It is.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.620
'This is Anita. Where would
you like to go today?'

24:28.620 --> 24:32.060
Er, Willow Springs Raceway.

24:32.060 --> 24:34.780
'Just a moment and
I can help you with that.'

24:36.220 --> 24:38.820
No... 'Let me just get that
plugged in for you.'

24:38.820 --> 24:42.180
And then can you make that come
onto my screen in the car?

24:42.180 --> 24:46.100
'Absolutely, I'm going to download
it to your navigation for you

24:46.100 --> 24:48.500
'instead of you putting it in
yourself.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.860
'Is there anything else
I can help with?'

24:50.860 --> 24:55.740
Er, no, I'm so staggered.
That's amazing, thank you very much.

24:55.740 --> 24:58.380
'You're welcome.

24:58.380 --> 25:00.780
'Definitely call us 24/7

25:00.780 --> 25:03.220
'and we will help you out, OK?'

25:06.700 --> 25:09.340
'In fact, I called her back
immediately.

25:09.340 --> 25:13.180
'And she suggested we stop off
at a nearby tourist attraction.'

25:15.620 --> 25:17.900
What they've done here is,
you will note,

25:17.900 --> 25:21.740
is fitted grooves at intervals
along the road. Right.

25:21.740 --> 25:26.340
So, as you drive over them,
your tyres make a noise.

25:26.340 --> 25:27.940
They play a note.

25:27.940 --> 25:32.300
Really? This road is musical.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.620
Is it? It's musical.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.380
Really? It plays a tune
as you drive...

25:37.380 --> 25:42.380
'As James has a music degree,
we sent him out to test it.'

25:42.380 --> 25:43.700
Here we go.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.220
Is that a tune?

25:57.860 --> 26:01.300
I think that was supposed to be
the William Tell Overture.

26:02.620 --> 26:05.340
Jeremy then had another idea.

26:05.340 --> 26:08.380
Richard Hammond and I
will now perform a duet.

26:14.300 --> 26:19.420
If I reverse, will it play
a message from the devil?

26:19.420 --> 26:21.500
This often happens in rock and roll.

26:24.260 --> 26:25.620
What a numpty.

26:25.620 --> 26:29.460
To make the tune go backwards, you
can still drive the car forwards.

26:29.460 --> 26:32.180
Yeah... Never mind.

26:32.180 --> 26:33.460
Yes.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.740
It's telling me
Paul McCartney's dead

26:35.740 --> 26:39.020
because he wasn't wearing
any shoes or socks.

26:51.340 --> 26:54.700
'Having decided the musical road
might be a bit annoying

26:54.700 --> 27:00.020
'if you live near it, we continued
onwards and eventually arrived

27:00.020 --> 27:01.780
'at Willow Springs.

27:06.060 --> 27:09.300
'We were keen to take on this
amazing race complex

27:09.300 --> 27:11.740
'in the high desert of California.

27:11.740 --> 27:14.420
'But the producers had other ideas.'

27:16.780 --> 27:18.140
Thank you.

27:20.220 --> 27:23.420
"You will be familiar with a game
called laser quest."

27:23.420 --> 27:26.180
That's that one... It's like
paintballing but with lasers.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.740
You have a jacket that's got
laser receptors on it

27:28.740 --> 27:31.820
and it registers when you've been
hit. Yes, I know that. What?

27:31.820 --> 27:35.260
"You will now play
aerial laser quest."

27:35.260 --> 27:36.900
How does that...? Well, hang on.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.620
"Your cars have been fitted
with laser receptors.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.820
"You will drive five laps
of the track

27:41.820 --> 27:46.540
"while two fighter planes, fitted
with laser guns, shoot at you.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.500
"The winner will be the one
who is least shot."

27:49.500 --> 27:52.820
Fighter planes with laser guns?
What planes? Are they model planes?

27:52.820 --> 27:54.580
Are they remote control?

27:57.740 --> 27:59.140
'They weren't.

28:01.740 --> 28:04.660
'In fact, they were
Italian Marchettis.

28:04.660 --> 28:10.980
'Fast, agile, armed and flown
today by two hotshot dog fighters.'

28:12.380 --> 28:15.180
Orbiting to the north...

28:17.300 --> 28:22.380
'With our laser sensors activated,
we set off at 30-second intervals.'

28:27.780 --> 28:29.900
Tally ho, tally ho, chaps.

28:31.740 --> 28:35.020
Stand clear, I'm going to go
for the Aston on the straight.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.860
They're after him already.
Kill him! Kill him!

28:41.220 --> 28:42.500
I missed.

28:47.820 --> 28:50.100
Let's just try sheer speed for a bit.

28:52.980 --> 28:55.820
Bit of braking might fox him there.

28:55.820 --> 28:58.180
No!

28:58.180 --> 28:59.620
Captain Slow.

28:59.620 --> 29:02.900
You're going to need to do better
than that, my friend.

29:02.900 --> 29:05.020
Big speed coming up, 140!

29:05.020 --> 29:08.380
That's nothing to those planes,
they could just reel me.

29:12.540 --> 29:15.820
OK. We're going to go
for the Lexus.

29:15.820 --> 29:19.620
Trying to shoot this car
from a plane like that, I'm sorry,

29:19.620 --> 29:23.420
it's like trying to swat a fly
with a drinking straw.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.660
Not going to happen.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.820
No!

29:33.820 --> 29:35.500
Bingo! Lex is dead.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.380
I'm hit again!

29:42.380 --> 29:46.420
They're just shooting at me
because my car's Japanese!

29:47.780 --> 29:50.660
It's racism. Sorry, Jeremy.

29:51.940 --> 29:54.100
'There was only one thing for it.'

29:54.100 --> 29:57.540
'Lexus Inform, this is Cheryl,
where would you like to go today?'

29:57.540 --> 30:00.780
I'm being attacked by
fighter planes!

30:00.780 --> 30:03.940
'I'm sorry, can you repeat that?'
Yes, I'm being attacked.

30:03.940 --> 30:06.980
There are fighter planes and
I'm trying to get away from them.

30:06.980 --> 30:08.500
Do you have any suggestions?

30:10.380 --> 30:15.100
'She didn't. And as a result,
the game became a turkey shoot.'

30:19.580 --> 30:20.660
What?!

30:20.660 --> 30:22.100
No!

30:22.100 --> 30:23.620
Argh!

30:23.620 --> 30:25.660
Lexus dead.
Hamster is dead.

30:25.660 --> 30:27.260
Bingo, Viper's dead.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.740
There's Viper.

30:31.740 --> 30:35.460
No, no, no, another hit for me!

30:35.460 --> 30:36.900
My God, they got Ginger.

30:39.020 --> 30:40.620
Smoke!

30:40.620 --> 30:42.140
Smoke!

30:47.460 --> 30:51.020
They're going in for the kill,
I can see him zooming down.

31:09.540 --> 31:13.180
'To be honest, we weren't enjoying
the relentless slaughter.'

31:14.740 --> 31:16.420
Under attack, under attack.

31:16.420 --> 31:18.900
'But we were at least loving
our cars.'

31:21.060 --> 31:24.620
The guts of this car are what make it
unbelievable on track.

31:25.940 --> 31:28.020
Just hauls ass.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.740
Jinking, jinking.

31:31.740 --> 31:32.980
And brake!

31:36.820 --> 31:38.980
That just feels tremendous.

31:43.460 --> 31:50.140
The word immediate was invented for
the throttle response on this car.

31:51.660 --> 31:55.700
And the steering. And the gearbox.
And every single thing about it.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.540
Ha-ha! Look at that.

31:59.540 --> 32:03.700
'But though our cars were good,
the planes were better.'

32:03.700 --> 32:07.100
My God, how did he get me there?

32:07.100 --> 32:12.140
'So, 26 laps into the 5-lap event,
we decided to get cunning.'

32:17.220 --> 32:21.980
You see? Ha-ha, where am I now then,
plane? You can't see me.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.300
Invisi... He's got me. Bugger!

32:28.420 --> 32:32.420
What I've done is, I've hidden
near the hills, behind a bucket.

32:34.740 --> 32:38.740
See, this is the ingenuity
that marks me aside.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.260
What?!

32:45.740 --> 32:51.060
Cunning wasn't working,
so we did what we do best - panic.

32:54.020 --> 32:57.740
Hammond, you're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way!

33:00.300 --> 33:02.380
Who's going the wrong way?

33:02.380 --> 33:03.980
I'm going the wrong way!

33:03.980 --> 33:06.420
No!

33:08.340 --> 33:10.020
What?!

33:11.900 --> 33:13.140
A bonus.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.220
No!

33:15.220 --> 33:19.220
'Fading light eventually brought
the massacre to an end.'

33:20.580 --> 33:24.060
There's a lot of bullet holes
on those cars down there.

33:31.300 --> 33:34.300
I liked that day.
That was a lot of fun.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.500
I really did.

33:35.500 --> 33:39.980
Can I just say, have you ever,
in your entire lives,

33:39.980 --> 33:43.780
seen aircraft flying lower or faster
than that? No. To be honest, no.

33:43.780 --> 33:46.500
I haven't. It's amazing. They
were just six feet off the deck.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.860
Can I just bring us towards
the meat of the thing here?

33:48.860 --> 33:52.820
Which is, I can now reveal,
I was hit 23 times.

33:52.820 --> 33:55.820
A-ha! 17 times.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.980
Come on then. What?
How many times where you hit?

34:02.980 --> 34:06.060
I can't remember.
Yes, you can. Come on.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.020
How many? 48.

34:10.020 --> 34:13.580
48?! So you lost...

34:13.580 --> 34:17.219
It was racism. Really? Racism?

34:17.219 --> 34:20.219
Either way, you lost. The pilots
told me as well that, James,

34:20.219 --> 34:22.980
you only won because every time
they went into a strafing dive

34:22.980 --> 34:25.860
to hit us, they had to anticipate
where the car would be.

34:25.860 --> 34:28.780
And every time your car was
considerably further back

34:28.780 --> 34:30.340
than they'd expected it to be.

34:30.340 --> 34:34.900
True. They said they couldn't hit you because
you were driving too slowly. Really? They did.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.460
Well, as I've said many times
before, gentlemen,

34:37.460 --> 34:41.699
he who is last shall be first,
and so it turns out.

34:41.699 --> 34:44.420
So the Baby Jesus had a point?

34:44.420 --> 34:48.780
Anyway, it is now time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

34:48.780 --> 34:52.020
My guest tonight is a member
of a popular ensemble where all

34:52.020 --> 34:54.460
the members find each other
very irritating.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.380
Imagine that Quite.

34:56.380 --> 35:00.380
Ladies and gentlemen, from Fleetwood
Mac, it is the man himself,

35:00.380 --> 35:01.620
Mick Fleetwood.

35:04.460 --> 35:06.340
Holy moly!

35:08.100 --> 35:12.860
You're here! How are you?
Mick Fleetwood has come to Top Gear.

35:16.780 --> 35:19.380
We sit? Yes, have a seat, please.

35:21.260 --> 35:24.900
Lord have mercy.
I've gone nervous. My God.

35:24.900 --> 35:27.580
Only Roger Daltrey sat
on that side of the sofa.

35:27.580 --> 35:31.340
It's obviously a rock thing.
No, that's lovely too. You choose.

35:31.340 --> 35:33.020
Or I can be just big.

35:33.020 --> 35:36.460
It's nice to have someone who is
the right height. There you go.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.300
We'll get on to your amazing
car history in a minute

35:39.300 --> 35:41.380
but if I may, I want
to talk about Rumours

35:41.380 --> 35:45.020
cos this is one of my absolute
all-time favourite albums.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.940
How many have been sold over
the years? Billions. No...

35:50.340 --> 35:54.060
A lot. Getting on for 50 million
copies or so, yeah.

35:54.060 --> 35:56.460
50 million copies?! I think, for me,

35:56.460 --> 36:00.820
the most amazing thing about Rumours
is that it got made at all.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.460
Because I think I'm right
in saying, I mean,

36:03.460 --> 36:06.100
people think of The Who
and Keith Moon in particular

36:06.100 --> 36:09.820
and Led Zeppelin and what have you,
there was some excess there.

36:09.820 --> 36:12.780
But when it came to excess,
Fleetwood Mac were really,

36:12.780 --> 36:15.860
as far as I can work out,
in a class of their own.

36:15.860 --> 36:19.620
Don't get me wrong,
we were definitely in the top ten,

36:19.620 --> 36:22.460
I would say, if not more.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.420
But I think the romance of that

36:24.420 --> 36:26.940
and the drama of that
became out of control,

36:26.940 --> 36:29.180
mainly because we were stupid enough,

36:29.180 --> 36:33.900
and somewhat irresponsible, to be
too open about our dirty laundry.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.660
You were talking in public.

36:35.660 --> 36:40.300
But it wasn't just the drugs either.
It was, as far as I can work out,

36:40.300 --> 36:45.020
the band was just made up of people
who were fighting at that time. Yes.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.740
We've got a photograph here
of the band.

36:46.740 --> 36:49.780
So there's you, in the middle, OK,
the drummer.

36:49.780 --> 36:53.020
And then we've got an American
couple who really didn't get on,

36:53.020 --> 36:55.100
they were falling out
during the recording.

36:55.100 --> 36:58.860
And a British couple. Yes. Who were
going through the same problems.

36:58.860 --> 37:02.380
Now, the songs that they were
writing about each other

37:02.380 --> 37:04.100
were genuinely about each other.

37:04.100 --> 37:09.500
So, Stevie wrote Dreams, which was
about her boyfriend Lindsey. Yeah.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.980
And then he wrote You Can
Go Your Own Way. Yes.

37:12.980 --> 37:16.620
I know where you're going with this.
I think it's phenomenal.

37:16.620 --> 37:20.740
The worst one was, was it Christine
wrote the song of John, her husband?

37:20.740 --> 37:23.940
Er, yes. She did You Make Loving
Fun and he must have thought,

37:23.940 --> 37:27.940
"Lovely song," but she was writing about the
lighting engineer she was having an affair with.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.260
This is true.

37:30.260 --> 37:33.460
Are you starting to feel even
vaguely sorry for me?

37:34.940 --> 37:38.220
It was unbelievably awkward
in the studio

37:38.220 --> 37:42.260
because Lindsey would save the
vocals until all the recording

37:42.260 --> 37:43.980
was done because he knew Dan well.

37:43.980 --> 37:46.660
If he starts singing all the lines
you're talking about

37:46.660 --> 37:49.100
with Stevie standing there,
she'd walk out.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.020
But the worst thing is...
Quite clever.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.940
It is, for getting the album down,

37:52.940 --> 37:56.620
but then if you have to take it on
tour, poor old Stevie, all of them,

37:56.620 --> 37:59.060
have to perform these songs about,

37:59.060 --> 38:01.900
"I've got a small penis
and I'm better off..." Yes.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.100
Because I'm just thinking,

38:03.100 --> 38:05.940
if we ever put a band together
on Top Gear, I could write a song

38:05.940 --> 38:10.260
called I Am A Crashing Bore and
then get James May to perform it.

38:10.260 --> 38:11.460
Awww.

38:11.460 --> 38:14.780
Then James could write one,
I'm An Irritating Little Brummie,

38:14.780 --> 38:17.180
and for 40 years
Hammond would have to go along,

38:17.180 --> 38:20.420
"I really don't like doing this."
Because that's what Rumours is.

38:20.420 --> 38:21.460
No doubt.

38:21.460 --> 38:26.460
That experience in the studio
was so horrendous, emotionally,

38:26.460 --> 38:31.260
and the music was great and we all
aspired to... We didn't ever think

38:31.260 --> 38:34.500
of walking out because we were
so into what we were doing.

38:34.500 --> 38:37.660
Became the glue that
if we got through that,

38:37.660 --> 38:41.620
we can get through 12 years
of high, high-powered,

38:41.620 --> 38:44.820
which is probably 12-15 years,
we didn't stop doing anything.

38:44.820 --> 38:46.980
Literally on the road,
in the studio...

38:46.980 --> 38:51.460
Cos you are still all together.
We are, yeah. We must get onto cars.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.060
We must get onto cars.

38:53.060 --> 38:57.140
You live on the Pacific island
of Maui. I do. Yeah. OK.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.860
You are a rock god,
an incredibly successful musician.

39:00.860 --> 39:03.420
And you drive a...

39:03.420 --> 39:06.820
My most cherished car
is an Austin 7.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.500
And we... This is... We're not...

39:08.500 --> 39:11.940
This is a picture of you with it
that we have here. Yeah.

39:11.940 --> 39:13.900
How did you come by that?

39:13.900 --> 39:18.020
Many, many, many years ago,
I probably was like 19.

39:18.020 --> 39:21.140
A friend of mine had a flat
in Earls Court.

39:21.140 --> 39:24.340
I get off the tube and there was
this little car,

39:24.340 --> 39:27.340
I kept walking by it,
month after month after month,

39:27.340 --> 39:29.260
and I fell in love with the car.

39:29.260 --> 39:33.820
And one time I left a note
on the car, said,

39:33.820 --> 39:36.460
"If ever you fancy selling this,

39:36.460 --> 39:38.820
"I would love to give
this car a home."

39:38.820 --> 39:43.500
And then about 18 months later we happened
to be starting to do fairly well.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.180
My mum, which was
the phone number I had left,

39:46.180 --> 39:48.860
got a phone call from
the guy, who said,

39:48.860 --> 39:53.660
"I'm moving and I want a home
for my little car." And I bought it.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.300
And you've still got it now? Yeah.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.900
But I presume that all the way
through these late '70s

39:58.900 --> 40:01.620
and '80s, obviously, you were
in a limo, so where was that?

40:01.620 --> 40:04.580
Well, that was part of those years

40:04.580 --> 40:06.900
when you're not quite sure
what happened.

40:09.580 --> 40:12.980
And I went with the band
to the United States,

40:12.980 --> 40:15.900
which was probably 15 or 16 years.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.820
Eric Clapton was
then my brother-in-law.

40:18.820 --> 40:24.700
I said, would you look after - it was
called Lettuce Leaf. The car was?

40:24.700 --> 40:28.860
By my children, it was Lettuce Leaf,
so it was always Lettuce Leaf.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.180
He said, sure, we'll put
it in the barn, and that was it.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.340
And years later, I got a call
from Eric's manager saying,

40:35.340 --> 40:36.740
"Can we get rid of it?"

40:36.740 --> 40:40.780
And I didn't realise it had
been in his orchard for 15 years

40:40.780 --> 40:44.100
and was full of birds' nests,
had been out in the open.

40:44.100 --> 40:46.620
It survived and they had it rebuilt,

40:46.620 --> 40:50.700
and the next time I saw it
was in Maui, where I live,

40:50.700 --> 40:56.780
and us car people, stupid sloppy
dates that we tend to be,

40:56.780 --> 41:00.660
I sort of broke down
when I met her at the dock.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.740
She was just there,

41:01.740 --> 41:05.260
in Maui, and I went,
"How cool is that?" I love all that.

41:05.260 --> 41:09.580
That's exactly what cars are.
To me, how fast they go

41:09.580 --> 41:12.860
is sort of not relevant,
it's how you... Absolutely.

41:12.860 --> 41:16.660
I got married to my first wife in
that car, and that was my only car.

41:16.660 --> 41:19.460
Now, presumably, you can't drive
Lettuce Leaf all the time,

41:19.460 --> 41:25.700
so what...? I have a 2004 twin turbo
Porsche that I like a lot.

41:25.700 --> 41:30.340
And I had it all tarted up.
That's my main car.

41:30.340 --> 41:33.020
Can you get it going in Maui?

41:33.020 --> 41:36.100
It's only an island,
so there's only three roads, really.

41:36.100 --> 41:39.780
But there is one that goes right
through sugarcane fields

41:39.780 --> 41:44.940
and you can get up to about 130,
140 miles an hour in certain places,

41:44.940 --> 41:48.140
which I confess that I do.
You just have, actually.

41:49.220 --> 41:52.060
You just did do that.
And that's in the Porsche.

41:52.060 --> 41:54.660
Have you actually ever done
any racing?

41:54.660 --> 41:58.220
Only in the old days,
the wicked '80s and early '90s.

41:58.220 --> 42:01.140
Anybody and everybody was doing it.

42:01.140 --> 42:03.740
It was an excuse for another
party or something,

42:03.740 --> 42:07.180
and we were all... Half of us
were stoned, most of the time.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.620
So what was it like out there today?

42:10.620 --> 42:12.620
Better than last week,
when it was snowing.

42:12.620 --> 42:15.580
Well, I wasn't stoned,
so that's good.

42:16.820 --> 42:18.500
Who would like to see Mick's lap?

42:18.500 --> 42:20.980
Yeah!

42:20.980 --> 42:25.180
Come on, mate. Lord.
Let's have a look. God.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.380
Right. Now, you're a drummer,

42:28.380 --> 42:30.860
and I always associate drummers
with being coordinated.

42:30.860 --> 42:32.660
Don't stop, come on, come on.

42:32.660 --> 42:36.420
Remember the damn song,
you played it for 40 years.

42:36.420 --> 42:38.620
.."Thinking about tomorrow"!
First corner.

42:38.620 --> 42:41.540
But you think drummers are going
to be able to get their hands

42:41.540 --> 42:46.140
and their feet... This was not me,
right? Yep, it sure is. Into the mud.

42:46.140 --> 42:49.900
That's pretty tidy.
Come on, don't pussyfoot it.

42:52.340 --> 42:54.700
You don't want to go
too fast through there,

42:54.700 --> 42:57.900
you'll just spin wide.
That looks quite tidy as well.

42:59.380 --> 43:03.420
Glad I had those brown underpants on,
I can tell you that much.

43:04.740 --> 43:08.260
What a beautiful looking day
out there it is today.

43:08.260 --> 43:14.140
It's going to go wrong any second,
right? No, look at that! Bang on.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.380
And up now towards
the follow-through.

43:18.780 --> 43:24.940
Full power. Full power, yes, yes,
yes, yes. Power it. Power!

43:24.940 --> 43:26.940
Come on!

43:28.140 --> 43:34.580
Cut it, cut it. Yes. This is the
tricky one. And that is nicely cut.

43:34.580 --> 43:37.620
And into Gambon...

43:37.620 --> 43:41.540
And no big dramas there,
and across the line!

43:45.100 --> 43:48.660
Now, that looked tidy.
But was it fast?

43:50.900 --> 43:57.620
Whereabouts do you think you've come?
I dread to think. No idea?

43:58.860 --> 44:03.260
I hope I'm not in the last 10.
You're not.

44:03.260 --> 44:07.100
Because, Mick Fleetwood,
you did it in 1...

44:08.220 --> 44:13.820
..45.4. And that...

44:15.420 --> 44:16.980
..puts you...

44:20.020 --> 44:22.820
..between a wizard
and bassist in Blur.

44:25.900 --> 44:29.660
Now, wait a minute. I always try
to look for some good news there.

44:29.660 --> 44:34.220
How old are you?
If that's not... I'm 65. Yeah, 65.

44:34.220 --> 44:37.100
So, you are, without any question
or shadow of doubt,

44:37.100 --> 44:39.660
the fastest pensioner
we've ever had.

44:45.620 --> 44:48.820
I've been looking forward to you
coming down ever since

44:48.820 --> 44:50.500
we knew this series was coming back,

44:50.500 --> 44:52.620
and it's just for me been
an enormous pleasure.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.940
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mick Fleetwood!

45:05.180 --> 45:10.140
Tonight we're driving across America
in three GT cars - the Lexus LFA,

45:10.140 --> 45:14.740
the Aston Martin Vanquish,
and the SRT Viper.

45:14.740 --> 45:17.620
So far, we have established
that none of them

45:17.620 --> 45:19.860
is a match for a
GP modified Mitsubishi

45:19.860 --> 45:23.220
and that all three have been
beaten by fighter planes.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.260
So, nothing of any practical
value whatsoever.

45:26.260 --> 45:29.260
But maybe that will
change in Los Angeles.

45:41.060 --> 45:44.380
'For a genuine, real-world test,
Hammond decided

45:44.380 --> 45:47.620
'we should head for one of the
city's famous storm drains.'

45:48.780 --> 45:49.900
Tell you what,

45:49.900 --> 45:53.940
I bet I can leave longer elevenses
in this then you can in yours.

45:53.940 --> 45:57.220
What, you mean black marks
on the road from wheel spinning?

45:57.220 --> 45:59.620
Yes, wheel spinning starts,
leave elevenses.

45:59.620 --> 46:02.940
I can do a longer elevenses than you.
No, you can't.

46:02.940 --> 46:05.220
I'll be the adjudicator.
You can be the adjudicator

46:05.220 --> 46:07.900
because I'm going to demonstrate
something to you now.

46:09.260 --> 46:12.380
Three, two, one and go.

46:22.620 --> 46:24.420
I'd say that was a dead heat. Yeah.

46:24.420 --> 46:29.380
'So, Hammond suggested we should see
who could do the best doughnuts.'

46:34.580 --> 46:36.500
Skid!

46:36.500 --> 46:38.100
Doing a big skid now.

46:39.180 --> 46:42.540
'Many Hollywood scenes have been
filmed here over the years,

46:42.540 --> 46:46.980
'but none has ever looked or
sounded quite as bovine as this.

46:46.980 --> 46:50.020
'And none has ever caused
quite so much damage.'

46:55.660 --> 47:00.260
Suggestions? I mean, running away,
obviously. That's where I was going.

47:00.260 --> 47:05.500
Running away, really. How far should
we run away? Quite a long way.

47:07.180 --> 47:09.500
And how soon? Now.

47:14.060 --> 47:16.380
I can't get my seatbelt on.

47:18.780 --> 47:20.140
Get in!

47:23.580 --> 47:25.380
Running.

47:25.380 --> 47:26.420
Running away.

47:28.380 --> 47:31.420
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

47:31.420 --> 47:34.580
'Lexus, this is Sonia,
where would you like to go today?'

47:34.580 --> 47:38.940
Yes, hello, I've accidentally
painted a gentleman's sausage

47:38.940 --> 47:40.580
on a storm drain.

47:40.580 --> 47:42.740
My. I need to run away.

47:45.900 --> 47:51.580
'The lovely lady suggested Palm
Springs, which was 110 miles away.

47:51.580 --> 47:56.100
'So we settled down and thought
a little bit about our cars.'

47:57.940 --> 47:59.860
Let's have a quick recap.

47:59.860 --> 48:04.020
This Aston has
the most charismatic engine,

48:04.020 --> 48:08.100
it's the most tasteful
and it was the least shot.

48:08.100 --> 48:11.580
Ask yourself, honestly,
from watching this programme,

48:11.580 --> 48:15.460
which of these cars you take if
you were to drive across America,

48:15.460 --> 48:18.300
across Europe, across Siberia.

48:18.300 --> 48:21.140
It doesn't matter. It's this one.

48:23.380 --> 48:26.700
I said at the beginning
of this trip that I had a feeling

48:26.700 --> 48:31.220
I might fall for the Viper, and
I have. It's won me over completely.

48:31.220 --> 48:34.660
It doesn't have the aluminium accents
inside of the Aston,

48:34.660 --> 48:36.260
or the computers of the Lexus,

48:36.260 --> 48:39.140
but it's done everything
we've asked of it on this journey,

48:39.140 --> 48:44.980
and it's done everything with its own
particular style, its own attitude.

48:44.980 --> 48:48.020
And let's not forget, at a fraction
of the price of the other two,

48:48.020 --> 48:49.940
this is the plucky underdog here.

48:51.820 --> 48:55.580
If somebody were to offer me
a choice of any car that had

48:55.580 --> 48:59.820
ever been made, ever,
I would take a dark blue LFA.

48:59.820 --> 49:04.020
That's how much I love this thing.
I mean, yes, there are faults.

49:04.020 --> 49:08.980
The petrol tank is too small, the
seatbelt is idiotic, and, joking

49:08.980 --> 49:13.980
aside, I would like a cup holder,
but the rest of it is so exquisite.

49:15.300 --> 49:18.820
I'm going to say it.
It's the best car I've ever driven.

49:18.820 --> 49:21.340
It really is.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.220
'With all that sorted out,

49:27.220 --> 49:30.100
'we opened the taps
and headed into Palm Springs.'

49:50.940 --> 49:54.900
Men bouncing a ball like
a netball. Like small girls.

49:54.900 --> 49:57.180
The man is going to catch the ball
and then throw it.

49:57.180 --> 49:59.980
And they score so many goals,
nobody reacts when they get a goal.

49:59.980 --> 50:03.580
Because it happens every 35 seconds.

50:03.580 --> 50:05.980
You can't really tackle someone,
can you?

50:05.980 --> 50:08.780
Erm... Can they not take
the ball...? Gentlemen, gentlemen.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.700
Haven't we finished?

50:18.780 --> 50:21.100
"We think you should run away more.

50:21.100 --> 50:23.900
"Tomorrow morning,
at precisely 8 o'clock,

50:23.900 --> 50:25.740
"you will race to the border."

50:25.740 --> 50:27.220
What border?

50:27.220 --> 50:29.660
You're not going to like this.

50:29.660 --> 50:33.260
"The last to arrive
will cross into Mexico...

50:34.420 --> 50:37.380
"..and spend a few days road testing
the Mastretta sports car

50:37.380 --> 50:40.620
"for a forthcoming
item on the show."

50:40.620 --> 50:47.500
The Mastretta is the one that
started a bit of trouble for us.

50:47.500 --> 50:49.980
When we spoke about it
on the news on the show,

50:49.980 --> 50:52.660
the Mexicans took an exception
to some of the things we said.

50:52.660 --> 50:57.020
They hate us in Mexico. Don't want
to go to Mexico. No, they hate us.

50:58.260 --> 51:01.580
'We told Hammond
we'd get an early night.

51:01.580 --> 51:03.580
'But we didn't.'

51:03.580 --> 51:06.380
Right, James and I have had
a bit of a discussion,

51:06.380 --> 51:09.420
and we've decided that since
it was Hammond that caused all

51:09.420 --> 51:11.620
the problems,
Hammond should lose this.

51:11.620 --> 51:13.260
So what have you got in mind, James?

51:13.260 --> 51:14.820
Well, what I've got in mind, Jeremy,

51:14.820 --> 51:17.500
or rather in my pocket,
is a couple of bananas.

51:17.500 --> 51:19.340
Because I've seen this in a film,

51:19.340 --> 51:21.380
I thought we could put
a banana in the tailpipe.

51:21.380 --> 51:23.300
A banana in the tailpipe.
Let's do it.

51:23.300 --> 51:25.980
What this does is prevent
the car from exhausting

51:25.980 --> 51:29.900
and the back pressure builds up
in the engine, and then it stops.

51:29.900 --> 51:32.620
'Annoyingly,
the Viper's exhaust was so big

51:32.620 --> 51:36.180
'we had to substitute the bananas
with a selection of other fruits.

51:36.180 --> 51:38.860
'And then Clarkson
had another idea.'

51:38.860 --> 51:41.940
If we pop his seat
all the way back, yes?

51:42.980 --> 51:45.540
It also has electric pedals,
this thing, yes?

51:45.540 --> 51:47.980
So if we make the pedals go
all the way forwards,

51:47.980 --> 51:54.300
the seat all the way back, and
then take the fuse out... Yes!

51:55.380 --> 51:58.900
'Having stolen the fuses
for the seat and the pedals,

51:58.900 --> 52:02.700
'we then disconnected two
of the V10's HT leads.'

52:02.700 --> 52:07.060
He's got a V8 motor,
he's got... No pedal movement.

52:07.060 --> 52:10.580
No pedal movement,
seat's fully back. That'll do.

52:14.660 --> 52:18.660
'At precisely 8:07 the following
morning, the race began.'

52:21.300 --> 52:23.260
Get back! Get back!

52:23.260 --> 52:27.980
The Lexus. The Viper!
The Lexus, the Lexus. It's there!

52:27.980 --> 52:29.500
That's mine, that's mine.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.820
Funny! I can't...
What are you...?

52:35.820 --> 52:38.540
No!

52:39.740 --> 52:42.580
This seatbelt is going
to be the death of me.

52:45.260 --> 52:47.460
Nice Thank you! Nice.

52:48.940 --> 52:51.820
Just for the record, and in case
this goes terribly wrong,

52:51.820 --> 52:55.300
I said I didn't like Mexican food,
and what I meant was,

52:55.300 --> 52:57.660
I don't like refried beans
and cheese.

52:57.660 --> 53:00.580
That's all.
It's all Hammond's fault.

53:02.100 --> 53:05.140
- Funny, funny, also funny.
- Thank you

53:05.140 --> 53:07.340
Right, we live in a cartoon,
really

53:10.100 --> 53:12.180
That's not right.

53:13.740 --> 53:17.140
The problem is that
Richard Hammond may be stupid

53:17.140 --> 53:20.540
and a rampant racist,
but he is quite practical.

53:20.540 --> 53:24.220
He'll have that car put back
together again in about five

53:24.220 --> 53:26.060
minutes - it would take me a year.

53:26.060 --> 53:28.220
It's an HT lead off.

53:28.220 --> 53:30.980
One...two.

53:30.980 --> 53:33.060
Right. I will kill them.

53:33.060 --> 53:35.100
I'm going to kill them.

53:35.100 --> 53:37.140
If the Mexicans don't, I shall.

53:40.900 --> 53:44.180
'As Hammond began
his hate-fuelled charge,

53:44.180 --> 53:48.100
'Jeremy and I were bogged down
in downtown Palm Springs.'

53:49.740 --> 53:53.420
So, we've got a retirement
community, the rozzers up ahead,

53:53.420 --> 53:56.940
there's nothing I can do.
40 miles an hour.

53:59.900 --> 54:02.780
I lost, I don't know, 10 minutes.
Maybe more.

54:02.780 --> 54:05.220
Jeremy's got to stop for fuel.

54:05.220 --> 54:07.860
He'll never get that done
in under five minutes.

54:07.860 --> 54:11.100
I have to hope James
gets lost or dawdles.

54:14.340 --> 54:17.060
What's really unfair
about this race is that

54:17.060 --> 54:22.420
I wasn't particularly rude about
Mexicans, I just made a small joke

54:22.420 --> 54:25.380
about the Mexican ambassador
in London.

54:25.380 --> 54:27.780
And I've been to see him,
I've apologised,

54:27.780 --> 54:32.460
drunk quite a lot of his tequila,
and all is well.

54:32.460 --> 54:35.420
But the Mexicans don't know that.

54:36.860 --> 54:39.940
'Once clear of Palm Springs,
we faced a choice.

54:39.940 --> 54:43.100
'Take the road to the east
of the Salton Sea, which was longer

54:43.100 --> 54:47.900
'but should be quiet, or go on the
freeway and pray it wasn't too busy.

54:47.900 --> 54:50.100
'I went for the freeway.'

54:52.020 --> 54:54.020
Take me to victory, Aston Martin.

54:57.860 --> 55:00.820
'Whilst, stupidly,
Jeremy went for the longer route.'

55:03.220 --> 55:07.180
106 miles to the border
and my range is...

55:08.900 --> 55:10.780
..104.

55:13.260 --> 55:14.460
Ohhhh.

55:14.460 --> 55:16.500
So now I've got a choice.

55:16.500 --> 55:22.660
Do I drive slowly and increase the
range, or drive fast and fill up?

55:25.860 --> 55:26.980
That one.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.060
I'm having him.

55:32.020 --> 55:36.180
Jeremy can't be going this fast
on that mountain road, surely.

55:37.820 --> 55:41.300
'Sorry, James, it wasn't a mountain
road, which meant that once

55:41.300 --> 55:46.860
'more, thanks to editing trickery,
I could get up to 55 miles an hour.'

55:49.540 --> 55:52.260
I'm in an American road movie now.

55:54.620 --> 55:58.780
'Feeling pleased with my choice
of route, I called Mr Angry.'

56:00.380 --> 56:05.060
Hammond. You utter,
utter bastard. Where are you?

56:05.060 --> 56:10.100
I'm on the east side, on the most
amazing road I've ever found.

56:10.100 --> 56:14.220
God. Have you seen James?

56:14.220 --> 56:17.660
No, I'm on the other road,
the other side of the water.

56:17.660 --> 56:19.340
So he should be ahead of me

56:19.340 --> 56:23.780
if he's gone this way, or... James
is on your side of the lake.

56:23.780 --> 56:27.500
So he must be on this road then.
Right, I'm going to reel him in.

56:35.700 --> 56:38.700
In fact, at this point,
we all had the hammer down.

56:45.380 --> 56:51.740
51 miles to go. 30 miles of range.

56:53.860 --> 56:58.340
Come on, Aston. Where the hell
is Hammond? Is he catching me?

57:00.420 --> 57:04.100
Right, 60 miles.
And no sign of James.

57:04.100 --> 57:07.380
I'm just praying to see
a speck of blue up ahead.

57:07.380 --> 57:10.260
I've got to be in front of Jeremy,
there's no way he can do it.

57:10.260 --> 57:11.900
He's got to stop for fuel.

57:14.060 --> 57:16.940
♪ Stand by your man... ♪

57:19.100 --> 57:22.180
I don't know what that is,
but that's all it's having.

57:23.580 --> 57:28.020
'To find out what damage the fuel
stop had done, I called May.'

57:29.700 --> 57:31.460
Clarkson. May, where are you?

57:31.460 --> 57:33.300
I have got to the bottom of the lake

57:33.300 --> 57:35.700
and I'm just coming
into the small town...

57:35.700 --> 57:40.020
No, I think you're ahead of me.
Has Hammond caught you up?

57:40.020 --> 57:43.580
Hammond is behind me,
but only by a few miles.

57:43.580 --> 57:47.540
Argh! That means he's probably
ahead of me.

57:47.540 --> 57:50.580
'But the race wasn't done yet.

57:50.580 --> 57:53.860
'Because at the bottom of the lake
there were three routes to

57:53.860 --> 57:57.180
'the finish line in the border
town of Calexico.

57:57.180 --> 58:00.540
'And none of us had any idea
which would be the fastest.'

58:02.260 --> 58:04.700
Jeremy will go on the 111.
He has to,

58:04.700 --> 58:09.140
because he's come from that side,
he will get to that one first.

58:09.140 --> 58:14.740
I get to the 86 first, but is it quicker?
I just don't know. God.

58:14.740 --> 58:16.700
What would Hammond do?

58:19.380 --> 58:24.140
Right, this road takes me straight
through Calexico to the border.

58:24.140 --> 58:26.140
I think this is the quickest.

58:26.140 --> 58:28.820
I think James has gone
a different route,

58:28.820 --> 58:30.620
this is where I'm going to take him.

58:32.460 --> 58:34.540
Please, God, don't let me be last.

58:37.020 --> 58:40.500
A big drive-through dentist there,
hopefully Hammond will stop at that.

58:43.700 --> 58:47.140
Four miles, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

58:48.980 --> 58:54.380
Coming into town now. This all
looks decidedly Mexican now.

58:54.380 --> 58:56.220
Which is to say brilliant, very nice.

58:57.700 --> 58:59.220
God.

58:59.220 --> 59:00.820
Traffic lights.

59:02.420 --> 59:05.340
God, and the rozzers
are behind me.

59:06.420 --> 59:08.740
Fifth Street, yes.
Does it go to Mexico?

59:08.740 --> 59:10.980
Where is the border crossing?

59:12.780 --> 59:16.140
Can't get lost right now.
Mess it all up at the end.

59:18.260 --> 59:20.260
Border, border, border.

59:39.820 --> 59:41.940
You beauty!

59:43.420 --> 59:46.100
May or Hammond,
which one is going to be eaten?

59:47.940 --> 59:51.060
'The answer came seconds later.'

59:51.060 --> 59:54.540
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.180
I don't care if you won -
is it just you here? Yep.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.220
Ho-ho!

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.540
God, no. No.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.100
Buenos dias!

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.340
Is that Mexico there?
That's the border there.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.420
Look, it's very simple.
Goodbye. Bye, thank you so much.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.980
You're in the United States
of America, land of the free.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.060
There's a big fence, the other
side of it, everybody hates you.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.860
Bye! Bye.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.100
It's a bit like sending Paddington
Bear into a mincing machine,

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.060
there is an element of...
He looks quite tragic.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.980
With that, back to the studio.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.980
I think we can probably handle
a conclusion on our own.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:51.660
Because the Aston Martin and
the Lexus were... Tremendous.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.140
They really were, weren't they?

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.620
And the Viper was... Awful.
Awful, absolutely.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.180
So there we are.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:01.500
Now, we will be bringing you
a review of the Mexican Mastretta

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.060
sports car in a couple of weeks,
unless of course in the meantime

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.900
somebody finds a suspiciously white
tooth in their taco.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.180
In which case, we will be showing
you a touching tribute to

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.940
the late broadcaster
Richard Hammond.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.660
So, on that potential bombshell,
it's now time to end.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.780
Thank you so much for watching,
good night.
