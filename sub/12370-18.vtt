- HEY, AREN'T YOU--
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.704
- I KNOW THIS CITY.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.498
CLEVELAND WON'T MIND
IF I LEAVE.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.874
MAYBE THEY WON'T
EVEN NOTICE.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.501
- THIS IS PERFECT.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.544
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE
THE CITY IS OURS AGAIN,

18:07.628 --> 18:09.087
AND THINGS WILL
BE BACK TO NORMAL.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.840
- GOOD-BYE, CLEVELAND.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.301
[car horns honking]
[overlapping shouting]

18:14.384 --> 18:17.346
[car alarms blaring,
explosions]

18:17.429 --> 18:18.847
- IT'S OKAY.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.349
NOBODY KNOWS
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.518
[indistinct shouting]

18:22.601 --> 18:24.019
- THERE THEY ARE!
GET 'EM!

18:24.102 --> 18:25.729
[all scream]

18:25.813 --> 18:29.817
all: STEVEN TYLER,
TAKE US BACK.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.527
- WE WANT EVERYTHING BACK
THE WAY IT WAS.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.903
WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.655
- INSTEAD OF CHASING AFTER
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE,

18:34.738 --> 18:36.657
WE SHOULD APPRECIATE
WHAT WE'VE GOT.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.116
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
STEVEN TYLER?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.701
- NO.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.328
THAT'S NOT THE LESSON.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.788
- WELL, THEN
WHAT IS THE LESSON?

18:42.871 --> 18:44.957
- LISTEN CLOSE
AND WRITE THIS DOWN.

18:45.040 --> 18:50.003
[scatting, clicking tongue]

18:50.087 --> 18:52.506
- I WAS WITH YOU
UNTIL "DIGGY-DIGGY-DAH."

18:52.589 --> 18:54.591
- AS HOT AS YOU ALL ARE,

18:54.675 --> 18:58.095
YOU'D BE THE LEAST
HOT WOMEN I EVER SLEPT WITH,

18:58.178 --> 18:59.805
EXCEPT YOU, ELKA.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.223
- THAT'S THE LESSON?

19:01.306 --> 19:02.558
- THAT'S WHAT
I GOT OUT OF IT.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.851
SEE YOU.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.103
[wailing]
WOW!

19:06.186 --> 19:08.063
- HOW DO WE GET BACK?

19:08.146 --> 19:09.565
- WELL, ACCORDING
TO STRING THEORY--

19:09.648 --> 19:11.191
- JUST DO IT.
- [snaps fingers]

19:14.820 --> 19:15.863
- [exhales]
OH, MY GOD.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.572
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT JUST HAPPENED.

19:16.655 --> 19:17.906
- NOW THAT IT HAS,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.199
HOW CAN ANYTHING
EVER BE THE SAME?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.410
- WE CAN'T UN-KNOW
WHAT WE KNOW.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.288
- MY ADVICE IS TO FORGET IT
EVER HAPPENED

19:24.371 --> 19:25.622
OR IT'LL MAKE YOU CRAZY.

19:25.706 --> 19:30.210
THAT'S MY ADVICE TO YOU TOO.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.086
- HEY, ELKA.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.296
<i>DER</i> SCHNITZEL'S
GETTING COLD.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.841
I MEAN, "WOOF."

19:35.924 --> 19:38.260
