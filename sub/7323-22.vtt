WOW, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

09:45.255 --> 09:47.017
NO.

09:47.017 --> 09:48.619
OKAY.

09:48.619 --> 09:51.962
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT OPTIONS?

09:51.962 --> 09:53.894
NO.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.026
(Morgan Taylor Reid's "Brighter"
playing)

09:56.026 --> 09:58.028
(man) OFFICIALS SAY
IT'S TOO EARLY

09:58.028 --> 10:00.330
TO SPECULATE
ON THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.332
BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO KNOW--

10:02.332 --> 10:05.175
THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED
THIS MORNING IN BALTIMORE

10:05.175 --> 10:09.309
CARRYING 183 PASSENGERS
AND 18 CREW MEMBERS...

10:09.309 --> 10:12.312
STILL NOBODY? OH, THEIR FAMILIES
ARE GOING CRAZY.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.284
WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?

10:14.284 --> 10:17.017
WELL, FISHING 200 PEOPLE OUT
OF THE WATER IS SLOW BUSINESS.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.150
YOU WANT TO PLAY
"ANGRY BIRDS"?
(Owen) THEY'LL DO TRIAGE
AT THE WATERFRONT.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.653
IT TAKES TIME. ACTUALLY,
IF THEY'RE TAKING THIS LONG,

10:22.653 --> 10:25.295
THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF HYPOTHERMIA. KEPNER.
OH, YEAH.

10:25.295 --> 10:28.298
WARM BLANKETS, HEATED LAMPS,
AND HEATED I.V. FLUIDS. GOT IT.

10:28.298 --> 10:31.031
YOU POST
CHIEF RESIDENT YET?
UH, NO. NOT YET.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.703
WHAT'S THE HOLDUP?

10:32.703 --> 10:35.635
(sighs) THE SUSPENSE AIN'T
KILLING ME. IT'S GONNA BE GREY.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.368
WELL, I THOUGHT KAREV
MADE A GREAT PLAY FOR IT.

10:38.368 --> 10:40.811
A PLANE FULL OF ORPHANS--
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
AH, HE'S ALREADY DECIDED.

10:40.811 --> 10:43.774
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOBBY
FOR YOUR BOY.
(Richard) KAREV.

10:43.774 --> 10:46.416
I WANT A WRITTEN ACCOUNT
OF EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW,

10:46.416 --> 10:48.949
EVERY DETAIL--WHEN, WHERE--
OH, LOOK, SIR,
I-I DON'T THINK THAT'S--

10:48.949 --> 10:51.822
I-I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK. OKAY?

10:51.822 --> 10:53.323
(Jackson)
NEED MORE SEDATIVES.

10:53.323 --> 10:56.026

12:04.855 --> 12:07.798

GOOD ABOUT THE FUTURE.

12:07.798 --> 12:11.131
I'M NOT CARRYING YOUR HOPES
AND DREAMS. NO. (laughs)
I GET TO TALK.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.934
I'M HERE. THERE'S TWO OF US.
WE ARE A PARTNERSHIP.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.437
CAN WE JUST--JUST THINK
TOGETHER? IS THAT OKAY?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.069
MM-HMM.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.145
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.877
I LOVE YOU.

12:26.877 --> 12:29.419
I DON'T LOVE THE INCUBATING
POTENTIAL OF YOUR WOMB.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.151
I LOVE YOU.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.153
WHY WOULD I
WANT TO DO SOMETHING

12:33.153 --> 12:34.885
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU MISERABLE?

12:34.885 --> 12:37.457
DO YOU THINK I LOVE YOU MORE
WHEN YOU'RE MISERABLE?

12:37.457 --> 12:40.460
DO YOU THINK I-I-I WANT THAT,
YOU RUNNING OFF TO MEREDITH?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.333
YOU THINK I'M LOOKING
FOR MORE OF THAT?

12:43.333 --> 12:46.166
BUT... I THINK
THERE'S A WAY--

12:46.166 --> 12:48.168
NO, NO!
I-I STILL GET TO TALK.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.170
THERE IS A WAY
TO MAKE THIS WORK

12:50.170 --> 12:53.804
WITHOUT IT RUINING YOUR LIFE
OR DERAILING YOUR CAREER.

12:53.804 --> 12:55.445
I DON'T WANT A BABY.

12:55.445 --> 12:57.777
WELL, YOU HAVE ONE.

12:59.249 --> 13:01.181
ARE...

13:01.181 --> 13:03.854
ARE YOU GETTING
ALL LIFE-Y ON ME?

13:03.854 --> 13:05.785
HOW LATE ARE YOU?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.317
THAT DOES NOT MATTER.

13:07.317 --> 13:10.060
OF COURSE IT MATTERS.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.062
OKAY, FINE. YOU TELL ME
WHEN LIFE BEGINS.

13:12.062 --> 13:14.424
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T--I CAN'T
WAIT TO HEAR THIS ONE.

13:14.424 --> 13:17.097
I DON'T KNOW. DOES IT--
DOES IT HAVE HANDS?
(laughs)

13:17.097 --> 13:19.499
(voice breaking) I CANNOT
BELIEVE YOU ARE DOING THIS.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.231
I'M JUST ASKING A QUESTION.

13:21.231 --> 13:25.335
I DON'T WANT ONE.

13:25.335 --> 13:28.138
I DON'T HATE CHILDREN.
I RESPECT CHILDREN.

13:28.138 --> 13:31.141
I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE
PARENTS WHO WANT THEM.

13:31.141 --> 13:32.883
I WANT THEM.

13:32.883 --> 13:34.985
I WANT THEM,
AND MAYBE YOU COULD TO.

13:34.985 --> 13:37.948
I BELIEVE...

13:37.948 --> 13:40.951
YOUR LIFE CAN BE BIGGER
THAN YOU THINK IT IS.

13:40.951 --> 13:44.194
I KNOW YOU CAN CONTAIN
MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU CAN.

13:44.194 --> 13:47.197
I'M NOT SAYING WE DO THIS.
I AM JUST SAYING, LET'S THINK.

13:47.197 --> 13:51.331
LET'S SEE WHAT KIND OF LIFE
WE CAN IMAGINE.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.134
CRISTINA YANG...

13:54.134 --> 13:58.168
I IMAGINE SUCH A HUGE LIFE
FOR US.

14:03.113 --> 14:05.115
(Richard) ALL RIGHT.

14:05.115 --> 14:08.118
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SERIOUS
ACCUSATION, MEREDITH.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.549
CAN'T YOU TELL ME ANYTHING?

14:09.549 --> 14:12.953
I-I-I-I CAN'T.
I-I'M SORRY.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.384
TALK TO ME.

14:14.384 --> 14:17.387
HOW MANY PATIENTS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

14:17.387 --> 14:19.389
DID THIS HAPPEN
MORE THAN ONCE?

14:19.389 --> 14:21.531
I CAN'T SAY THAT EITHER.

14:21.531 --> 14:23.133
SHE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.965
WE'RE GONNA UNWIND THIS,
MEREDITH.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.998
KAREV IS FIGURING OUT WHAT CASES
HE WAS ON WHEN HE SAW YOU,

14:27.998 --> 14:30.870
HE'LL NARROW DOWN THE DATES,
WE'LL KNOW WHICH PATIENTS--

14:30.870 --> 14:33.573
NOTHING I DID
CHANGED THE TRIAL.

14:33.573 --> 14:37.277
UH, FIRE ME. DO WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO DO.
LOOK, YOU DON'T GET
TO CHOOSE, OKAY?

14:37.277 --> 14:40.110
(knock on door)

14:40.110 --> 14:44.314
YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHO
GETS THE DRUG OR THE PLACEBO.

14:44.314 --> 14:47.017
YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHAT
INFORMATION THE TRIAL GETS.
(door opens)

14:47.017 --> 14:50.660
ANYTHING I TELL YOU
AFFECTS THE TRIAL.

14:50.660 --> 14:54.024
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID,
THE TRIAL STAYS BLIND.

14:54.024 --> 14:56.566
THE TRIAL IS OVER.
YOU SCREWED ME.

14:56.566 --> 14:59.129
YOU SCREWED THIS HOSPITAL.
AND YOU SCREWED YOURSELF.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.301
THIS IS YOUR DISEASE
WE'RE TRYING TO CURE.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.134
I MEAN, I COULD'VE PICKED
PARKINSON'S...
IT WAS ADELE.

15:04.134 --> 15:06.176
OR LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE,
BUT I DID THIS FOR YOU.

15:06.176 --> 15:08.138
DEREK, IT WAS ADELE.

15:15.986 --> 15:18.448
(exhales)

15:18.448 --> 15:20.450
UH, MAYBE I SHOULD PUT

15:20.450 --> 15:23.423
SOME I.V. FLUIDS IN THE HEATER
WARM THEM UP?
NO.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.496
BUT IF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
IN THE WATER FOR THAT LONG--
APRIL--

15:26.496 --> 15:29.099
BUT IF WE JUST--
(Mark) NO ONE'S COMING.

15:29.099 --> 15:34.104
IF IT'S TAKING THIS LONG,
NOBODY SURVIVED.

15:35.505 --> 15:36.967
(sighs)

15:49.379 --> 15:51.321
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

15:51.321 --> 15:53.053
I DON'T KNOW.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.685
WELL, THE PROTOCOL
IS FAIRLY CLEAR.

15:55.685 --> 15:58.258
ARE YOU ENCOURAGING HIM
TO FIRE ME?

15:58.258 --> 16:01.461
LOOK, DEREK, I BASICALLY
PRESSURED HER TO DO IT.
MM.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.194
YOU'D HAVE TO FIRE US BOTH.

16:04.194 --> 16:06.236
(door opens)

16:06.236 --> 16:08.038
(door slams)

16:08.038 --> 16:10.070
(sighs)

16:10.070 --> 16:12.072
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SUSPEND YOU

16:12.072 --> 16:14.074
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.745
THE STUDY...

16:15.745 --> 16:18.348
I NEED TO TURN THE WHOLE MESS
OVER TO THE F.D.A.,

16:18.348 --> 16:20.350
LET THEM FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

16:20.350 --> 16:23.313
I MEAN, I-I CAN'T. I JUST--
(knock on door)

16:30.260 --> 16:31.461
MEREDITH...

16:31.461 --> 16:33.123
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO...

16:33.123 --> 16:34.694
I KNOW.

16:41.601 --> 16:45.505
EMERGENCY SERVICES
HAS BEGUN IDENTIFYING BODIES.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.337
THEY'VE GIVEN US A LIST.

16:47.337 --> 16:50.009
THE AIRLINE REPS
ARE ON THEIR WAY.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.742
WE'VE GOT SOCIAL WORKERS HERE
AND MORE COMING.

16:52.742 --> 16:56.086
IT'S A LONG LIST. EACH OF YOU
HAVE FAMILIES TO INFORM.

16:56.086 --> 16:58.088
SO, UH, PLEASE BE
OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA

16:58.088 --> 16:59.489
INEXACTLYONE HOUR.

16:59.489 --> 17:01.551
YOU'LL CALL ONE FAMILY
AT A TIME.

17:01.551 --> 17:03.553
AND YOU'LL BE ASSIGNED
A ROOM

17:03.553 --> 17:06.056
TO TAKE THEM TO
AND DELIVER THE NEWS.

17:06.056 --> 17:08.358
IT'S GONNA BE
A-A LONG DAY.

17:08.358 --> 17:11.201
THAT'S IT.

17:11.201 --> 17:14.564
(indistinct conversations)

17:28.718 --> 17:31.321
DR. HUNT, YOU GAVE
CHIEF RESIDENT TO KEPNER?

17:31.321 --> 17:33.323
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ME OR GREY.

17:33.323 --> 17:35.325
DO YOU THINK ANYONE'S
GONNA LISTEN TO KEPNER?

17:35.325 --> 17:38.358
IT'S GONNA BE COMPLETE CHAOS.
YOU THINK ANYONE'S
GONNA LISTEN TO YOU?

17:38.358 --> 17:40.390
YOU JUST SOLD OUT THE ONE
UNIVERSALLY LIKED INDIVIDUAL

17:40.390 --> 17:42.762
AT THIS HOSPITAL.
EVERYONE IS GONNA HATE YOU.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.764
A CHIEF RESIDENT'S SUPPOSED
TO MANAGE THEIR PEERS,

17:44.764 --> 17:47.367
BE A RESOURCE AND A SUPPORT.
AFTER WHAT YOU DID,

17:47.367 --> 17:50.340
DO YOU THINK ANYONE IS GONNA
COME TO YOU FOR ANYTHING?

17:50.340 --> 17:52.342
I WAS PLANNING
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

17:52.342 --> 17:55.245
AND NOW?

17:55.245 --> 17:57.747
(woman) SO IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT WE'LL NEVER...

17:57.747 --> 17:59.649
THAT WE JUST...

17:59.649 --> 18:02.081
WE JUST
WON'T GET THE TREATMENT?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.083
IT'S A POSSIBILITY,
YES.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.416
OH, MY GOD.
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

18:06.416 --> 18:08.087
WE'RE SO CLOSE.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.121
HE NEEDS THIS. CAN YOU JUST...
IS IT KILLING PEOPLE?

18:11.121 --> 18:13.823
NO.
SO GIVE IT TO HIM ANYWAY.

18:13.823 --> 18:17.297
I WISH WE COULD.
NO.DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.230
YOUCAN
AND YOU'RE CHOOSING NOT TO.
AUDREY--

18:20.230 --> 18:22.672
NO. THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING
THEY CAN DO.

18:22.672 --> 18:25.335
THERE'S A DRUG IN A BOX
IN THIS HOSPITAL,

18:25.335 --> 18:27.106
AND YOU WERE ON THE SCHEDULE.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.309
MY CHILDREN'S FATHER
IS DISAPPEARING.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.111
GIVE HIM THE DAMN DRUG!

18:35.345 --> 18:36.746
(man speaks indistinctly)

18:36.746 --> 18:39.749
I COULD TAKE A LEAVE
FOR SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR.

18:39.749 --> 18:41.491
NO, YOU COULDN'T.

18:41.491 --> 18:44.224
YES, I--SURE, I COULD.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA FIRE ME.
NO.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.626
STOP SAYING NO.
I'M TELLING YOU, I WANT THIS.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.358
I CAN DO THIS.

18:48.358 --> 18:50.660
THISDOES NOT
HAVE TO BE YOUR PROBLEM.

18:50.660 --> 18:53.363
IT'LL BE MY PROBLEM.
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN--

18:53.363 --> 18:55.805
WHAT, NOTICE?
IT'LL BE A BABY.

18:55.805 --> 18:59.669
I'M NOT A MONSTER. IF I HAVE
A BABY, I'LL--I'LL LOVE IT.

18:59.669 --> 19:01.811
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

19:01.811 --> 19:04.714
(laughs)
THAT YOU'LL LOVE IT.

19:04.714 --> 19:07.477
THAT--THAT'S A PROBLEM
THAT WE CAN WORK WITH.

19:07.477 --> 19:09.479
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU LAUGHING RIGHT NOW?

19:09.479 --> 19:12.682
NO, NO. I'M JUST--I'M NOT--
I JUST...

19:12.682 --> 19:14.284
I LOVE YOU.

19:14.284 --> 19:16.686
WHAT IS SO--
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

19:16.686 --> 19:18.688
YES. I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

19:18.688 --> 19:20.690
SOME KIND OF A COMPROMISE.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.832
OKAY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE IS NO COMPROMISE.

19:22.832 --> 19:24.834
YOU DON'T HAVE HALF A BABY.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.696
I DON'T WANT ONE.

19:26.696 --> 19:28.698
OKAY, I-IT ISN'T ABOUT WORK.

19:28.698 --> 19:30.700
THIS ISN'T
A SCHEDULING CONFLICT.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.442
I DON'T WANT TO BE A MOTHER.

19:32.442 --> 19:34.704
CRISTINA, DO YOU LOVE ME?

19:34.704 --> 19:36.446
OF COURSE I DO.

19:36.446 --> 19:38.177
DO YOU TRUST ME?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.809
I... Y-YES.

19:39.809 --> 19:42.712
YOU'D BE A GREAT MOTHER.
YOU WOULD.

19:42.712 --> 19:45.485
I-I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
BUT IT IS TRUE.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.887
JUST SIT WITH THIS
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

19:47.887 --> 19:51.761
THIS TERRIBLE IDEA
THAT YOU MIGHT LOVE A BABY.

19:51.761 --> 19:53.763
JUST FOR ME, SIT WITH IT--

19:53.763 --> 19:56.766
