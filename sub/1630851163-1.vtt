WEBVTT

01:08.861 --> 01:10.070
Is someone there?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.498
You there. Identify yourself.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.300
I said identify yourself now.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.595
I'm nobody.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.560
Give me your knots.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.026
You don't need my knots.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.529
And why is that?

03:28.333 --> 03:29.668
I thought I killed him.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.421
Your sword went straight through.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.008
He would have died from his wounds,
but much later.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.761
Come here, boy. Come here.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.391
You can't see a kill.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.894
You must feel it. Put your hands on mine.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.691
Now close your eyes. Close them.

03:54.943 --> 03:59.239
You push in and up. Up.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.869
-Do you feel that?
-Yes.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.954
You know, the ripping and the tearing.

04:07.831 --> 04:12.461
You cut up like that,
I promise you he'll stay dead.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.392
Straighten your leg.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.403
Are we gonna have another problem?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.376
Lieutenant Wren. I just came by
to check up on the prisoner.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.336
-Anything to report?
-She's fine.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.297
General, you said it would be a
few days. It's been almost a month.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.549
It won't be much longer.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.801
I don't understand
why you have to keep her here.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.846
You know I can't make her
an official prisoner.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.140
If the Triangle hears you've
smuggled a sighted prisoner into the city,

07:12.224 --> 07:15.143
-we'll both be as good as dead.
-You'll be fine.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.647
You're following orders, so follow them.
Let me worry about the council.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.900
You're the only one
I can trust with this, Wren.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.944
You trust me enough to do your bidding,

07:24.027 --> 07:26.446
but not to tell me who she is
and why she's here.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.868
I would also like to know
who you are and why I'm here.

07:53.891 --> 07:58.979
I am… Commander General Edo Voss.

08:02.232 --> 08:06.028
And you will speak… when spoken to.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.456
As you were, Lieutenant.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.090
You managed not to ruin this one's armor.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.092
Feels like you could squeeze into it.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.470
I just need the chest plate.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.389
Here, hold my sword.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.227
Do you think it'll fit?

08:39.477 --> 08:42.397
It doesn't have to fit.
It just has to carry his smell.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.691
Son, give me a sword.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.112
Okay.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.115
You and Paris camp 50 heartbeats
into the trees.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.409
-Against the mountain wall--
-What are you talking about?

08:54.493 --> 08:55.786
I'm coming with you.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.915
No. No, no, no, you are not. It's gonna be
hard enough getting one of you out.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.793
Then how are you gonna find her?
You'll need my eyes.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.670
Your eyes?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.423
Dad, what are you doing?

09:10.259 --> 09:11.260
Baba!

09:13.554 --> 09:15.430
-Hit me back.
-What?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.480
I said hit me.

09:26.692 --> 09:29.695
They will hear every move you make
just as I do.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.073
A lifetime of sight has
left you loud and clumsy.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.366
That's enough.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.996
Kofun. Kofun.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.205
My son.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.667
Listen to me.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.336
Your mother and I…

09:47.462 --> 09:51.550
we raised you to be beautiful,
not a warrior.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.053
I don't want you to have to fight
the way that I had to.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.059
I never imagined a life for you
away from the Alkenny.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.770
And I failed to prepare you.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.278
I will likely not return.

10:11.862 --> 10:15.199
You need to learn how to fight
with your eyes closed like a blind man,

10:15.282 --> 10:16.575
as I would've taught you.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.912
Remember, your eyes betray you.

10:20.913 --> 10:21.914
Dad…

10:23.207 --> 10:25.626
Someone has to survive. Okay?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.087
-Paris.
-Yes.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.255
Come here.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.592
Listen to me. You wait seven days.

10:33.675 --> 10:37.888
If I do not return, then I am dead,
and so is Haniwa.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.391
You get away from here as far as possible.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.852
Paris, say it.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.730
Seven days, we go.

10:48.899 --> 10:52.069
If I do not return, you'll be all he has.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.153
Yes.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.460
I swore I'd never return here.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.506
Come back with Haniwa and swear it again.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.094
I'm sorry, boy.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.389
I love you, my son.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.146
Are you well?

12:09.730 --> 12:10.939
Of course I'm well.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.066
You were out there for some time.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.778
Too many days on the trail
eating poorly-cooked game.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.572
I don't have your Alkenny stomach.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.535
How far to Pennsa?

12:23.619 --> 12:26.455
Just a short distance beyond the lake,
Your Highness.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.539
Well, then…

12:29.041 --> 12:30.042
Onward.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.628
-Tak!
-Tak.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.688
Twenty-sixth border battalion, sir.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.941
When they didn't check in,
we came looking.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.152
They most likely came across
a band of smugglers.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.617
No. This wasn't smugglers.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.786
Sir?

13:08.330 --> 13:09.540
Take them in.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.251
-Full honors.
-Yes, sir.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.091
Welcome home, Baba.

13:52.916 --> 13:53.917
Knots.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.588
Proceed.

14:04.928 --> 14:05.929
Knots.

14:13.770 --> 14:14.897
Captain Koji?

14:16.982 --> 14:18.317
Twenty-six battalion?

14:19.318 --> 14:21.653
Twenty-six isn't due back until tomorrow.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.282
I was ordered in early
for a casualty report.

14:28.619 --> 14:29.995
That's unusual, isn't it?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.624
Not when there are casualties.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.319
You can head to the Eastern Gate.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.112
Sir.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.992
You need to eat.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.661
What do you care if I eat?

15:11.662 --> 15:12.871
I don't.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.916
I'm just trying to make you comfortable.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.252
I have been chained to this bed for weeks.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.213
Believe me,
Edo could do much worse to you.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.381
Then why hasn't he?

15:24.424 --> 15:25.884
Why is he doing this to me?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.012
I already told you I don't know.

15:31.265 --> 15:32.933
I don't even know why you're here.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.653
The general said his name is Edo Voss.

15:46.947 --> 15:47.948
So?

15:49.867 --> 15:51.493
My father is Baba Voss.

15:52.870 --> 15:53.912
Edo's brother?

15:54.663 --> 15:55.873
You've heard of him?

15:57.374 --> 16:00.919
Only the stories. I--
I was still a kid when he fled.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.382
But Edo's been searching for him
for over 25 winters

16:05.465 --> 16:07.384
to avenge his father's death.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.512
-You're saying Baba killed his own father?
-Yes.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.389
I don't believe that.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.642
Well, what you believe
doesn't actually matter.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.896
Edo is using me to lure Baba here.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.942
Most men choose
to avoid my father at any cost.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.738
Well, the general is not like most men.

16:28.906 --> 16:32.826
And he's been waiting a very long time
to get his hands on Baba Voss.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.342
You don't know my father.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.845
When he comes for me,
you won't know it until we're gone.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.058
Your father might be able to
make it into the city…

16:56.141 --> 16:57.226
Next.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.353
…but he'll never get out alive.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.523
Identification knots.

17:02.606 --> 17:03.982
This is Edo's city.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.818
Let's go. Hurry it up.
Identification knots.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.612
And he'll be waiting for him.

17:33.804 --> 17:37.140
So Edo is the general,
and you work for Edo.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.600
What does that make you?

17:40.435 --> 17:44.356
That makes me someone who feels like
she's answered enough of your questions.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.777
Okay. Just one more.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.869
Does he know you can see?

18:27.983 --> 18:29.693
Come get a taste.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.113
Sexual satisfaction for all tastes.

18:33.614 --> 18:35.991
Whatever you feel you want to…

18:38.827 --> 18:41.496
-Pleasure guaranteed.
-Look at these beauties here!

18:41.580 --> 18:45.959
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday

18:46.043 --> 18:50.255
-Who could hang a name on you?
-Thank you.

18:50.339 --> 18:54.426
When you change with every new day

18:54.510 --> 18:57.137
Still I'm gonna miss you

19:04.853 --> 19:07.064
Come on, you lazy bastards!

19:07.856 --> 19:11.276
Mind the fires.
I don't want that slag settling.

19:15.489 --> 19:18.742
Smithy. This one's no good.

19:21.078 --> 19:22.621
Must have cracked while it was cooling.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.039
'Cause it was moved while cooling.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.333
Melt it down.
Take more care, for fuck sake.

19:35.008 --> 19:38.345
Military steel. Black's hilt. Authentic.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.599
You've got the chest plate to match.
That's a rare haul.

19:43.851 --> 19:44.977
What is it worth to you?

19:45.060 --> 19:48.188
It's against the law to buy
or sell military weapons.

19:49.106 --> 19:52.276
-Guess I'll have to take it back.
-Wait, wait, wait.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.237
Ten coppers.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.824
The hilt alone is worth that. Twenty.

19:59.575 --> 20:00.659
For 20 coppers,

20:00.742 --> 20:03.829
you'd have to bring the soldier
that you fucking stole it from.

20:04.997 --> 20:07.416
You should have told me that
before I killed him.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.545
I know that voice. But it can't be.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.382
It belongs to a man that's dead.

20:16.175 --> 20:17.885
And if he isn't dead,

20:17.968 --> 20:20.053
then I could get 100 coppers
for turning him in.

20:20.137 --> 20:23.640
Yes… but first,
you'd have to make it out alive.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.893
And I know you can't outrun me.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.437
Fuck you.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.689
Baba Voss.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.609
You gotta be crazy coming back here.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.737
I'm happy to hear your voice.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.698
But I suspect
I'll be regretting it soon enough.

20:40.657 --> 20:41.742
Yes, you will.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.828
Come, it's a little cooler in the back.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.708
How did you know?

20:51.460 --> 20:53.253
I've spent my whole life hiding it.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.381
Just like you. I know what it looks like.

20:59.218 --> 21:01.220
Clearly, Jerlamarel is not your father.

21:04.973 --> 21:05.974
No.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.937
My parents are here in Trivantes.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.189
And your mother or father?

21:13.524 --> 21:14.733
They're normal.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.152
So are my brothers.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.865
Jerlamarel was born to blind parents,

21:21.949 --> 21:25.077
but I've never heard
of anyone else like that.

21:28.539 --> 21:30.123
Are there others like you here?

21:31.875 --> 21:35.003
None… that I know of.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.007
Well, that must be very lonely.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.638
And being a soldier,

21:44.721 --> 21:47.975
aren't you worried they'll figure it out
and burn you as a witch?

21:49.768 --> 21:53.564
Trivantes isn't like Paya.
No one here believes in witches.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.527
But they would still execute me.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.322
If they don't believe in witches,
then why?

22:03.282 --> 22:06.493
Our government isn't superstitious,
but they're practical.

22:07.119 --> 22:10.205
There are laws in the strands
going back centuries.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.419
Vision destroyed the world once.

22:17.838 --> 22:20.007
And they will not allow it
to happen again.

22:23.135 --> 22:27.890
So if I told the general your secret,
it wouldn't go well for you, would it?

22:41.737 --> 22:45.199
It would be the word
of a desperate prisoner

22:45.282 --> 22:46.867
against a loyal lieutenant.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.744
Who do you think he would believe?

22:51.205 --> 22:53.498
And be glad that's the case…

22:53.582 --> 22:55.459
because otherwise,
I'd have already killed you

22:55.542 --> 22:57.878
and told the general
you died trying to escape.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.672
You wouldn't kill me.

23:02.841 --> 23:04.259
You don't know me.

23:07.638 --> 23:10.182
I already know you better
than anyone ever has.

23:30.661 --> 23:33.914
Her Royal Highness Queen Kane.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.811
Even in all this noise,
I can still hear you pouting.

23:57.020 --> 24:00.023
You gave me your word
we would keep searching for my family.

24:00.107 --> 24:01.316
And we shall.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.278
We've been searching for over 30 days.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.321
We can't wander
the countryside indefinitely.

24:06.405 --> 24:07.865
We have a kingdom to reclaim.

24:09.241 --> 24:11.660
Once we have, we'll own fresh soldiers

24:11.743 --> 24:14.371
and a base
from which to continue the search.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.957
Fruitless though it may be.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.289
We should leave.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.166
Calm yourself, Boots.

24:59.249 --> 25:01.376
You grew up alone and in filth,

25:01.460 --> 25:04.463
and now you're a consort
to the Payan Queen.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.799
-Do you not grasp the miracle in that?
-I am a witch here.

25:07.883 --> 25:13.597
You serve a sacred and specific purpose.
She will keep you safe. Now stop whining.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.024
Beautiful room.

25:28.612 --> 25:29.655
My queen.

25:30.447 --> 25:31.865
My queen.

25:32.616 --> 25:34.535
We're all so relieved you survived.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.955
When we heard of the destruction
of Kanzua, we feared the worst.

25:38.539 --> 25:41.625
Lord Harlan,
thank you for this wonderful reception.

25:43.252 --> 25:46.588
Your presence is an honor
in any circumstance,

25:46.672 --> 25:49.466
let alone a triumphant return
from the dead.

25:49.550 --> 25:52.010
Hello, Lord Harlan.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.805
Hello. Who's this?

25:59.017 --> 26:00.018
Maghra?

26:00.102 --> 26:02.354
Did you not recognize my voice?

26:03.313 --> 26:04.481
It can't be.

26:04.565 --> 26:06.358
It is me, Harlan.

26:07.526 --> 26:08.735
Princess.

26:14.116 --> 26:15.826
Both sisters return to us!

26:16.618 --> 26:18.662
Truly a miraculous day!

26:19.830 --> 26:23.083
It's been so long.
I'm surprised you even remember me.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.502
-'Course I remember you.
-Good.

26:26.211 --> 26:28.589
'Cause as I recall,
you're a big admirer of mine.

26:29.882 --> 26:31.383
My queen.

26:31.466 --> 26:34.344
The knots we received
in advance of your party

26:34.428 --> 26:35.554
indicated your intention

26:35.637 --> 26:38.015
to consecrate Pennsa
as the new Payan capital.

26:38.098 --> 26:39.850
I assume you have no objection?

26:40.350 --> 26:43.061
On the contrary, I am humbled.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.814
I've known you too long to believe that.

26:50.319 --> 26:52.571
We all mourned the loss of Kanzua,
my queen.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.158
Truly an inconceivable tragedy.

26:57.659 --> 26:58.660
Yes.

27:00.329 --> 27:03.207
One we'll have plenty of time to discuss
in a more private setting.

27:04.249 --> 27:05.292
Of course.

27:07.294 --> 27:09.880
I can only imagine
how terrible your journey's been.

27:11.465 --> 27:12.925
The genocide of your people.

27:13.759 --> 27:16.637
You cast out into the badlands
beyond the lower walls.

27:17.638 --> 27:20.724
So I've taken the liberty
of securing you a beautiful residence.

27:21.225 --> 27:22.893
It's well-fortified, perfectly located.

27:22.976 --> 27:25.270
-You'll be comfortable--
-Which is the highest house in Pennsa?

27:27.397 --> 27:29.691
Well, that would be this house. My house.

27:30.734 --> 27:31.735
Would it?

27:34.613 --> 27:37.574
Which I would be honored
to repurpose as your palace.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.744
I'll have you brought upstairs at once.

27:41.328 --> 27:44.957
I will not forget your kindness,
Lord Harlan.

27:48.418 --> 27:49.920
Princess Maghra.

27:54.383 --> 27:57.678
Well, this is something
of a clusterfuck, isn't it?

27:58.887 --> 28:03.058
So, you're just gonna let her
ride in like this and take your city?

28:03.934 --> 28:05.185
She's the queen.

28:05.853 --> 28:08.313
You have more soldiers
than she has Witchfinders.

28:08.397 --> 28:11.149
Yes, but hers are more adept at killing
than mine.

28:12.693 --> 28:15.028
Besides, handled properly,

28:15.112 --> 28:18.615
there are advantages
to having the queen this close.

28:19.825 --> 28:22.995
Yesterday, the queen was dead.
That was close enough for me.

28:23.078 --> 28:26.331
Kerrigan, you're my brother,
and I love you,

28:27.374 --> 28:28.959
but you have no imagination.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.508
So all this time,

28:36.592 --> 28:38.760
you've been hiding in the Payan mountains.

28:40.012 --> 28:43.140
-It's hard to imagine you as a Payan.
-I'm not.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.142
I lived among the hidden tribes.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.354
So you're not a Trivantian.

28:49.438 --> 28:50.898
You're not a Payan.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.066
Well, at least you're not
a fucking Ganite, right?

28:53.150 --> 28:54.193
Yakis…

28:56.904 --> 29:00.532
Right to the fucking point. Same old Baba.

29:00.616 --> 29:01.742
Okay, what is it?

29:03.869 --> 29:05.871
-Edo.
-Shit.

29:08.165 --> 29:09.833
He took my daughter.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.710
I need to find out where he's hiding her.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.545
You've been away a long time, Baba.

29:13.629 --> 29:15.631
Edo's come up in the world.

29:15.714 --> 29:19.051
-I know he's the general.
-He's the commander general.

29:19.718 --> 29:21.512
-He's commander general?
-That's right.

29:21.595 --> 29:23.305
You'll never get anywhere near him.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.475
Not that you'd want to.
He'll skin you alive for what you did.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.228
She's my little girl.

29:29.895 --> 29:31.480
Do you understand that?

29:32.564 --> 29:34.691
Look, I've been out for a long time,

29:34.775 --> 29:38.529
but if he took her to draw you in,
she won't be in a regular prison.

29:38.612 --> 29:41.031
My guess is that he'll have her
at base three.

29:41.990 --> 29:43.700
Tell me about base three.

29:43.784 --> 29:46.453
It's a sealed compound.
Secret army doings.

29:46.537 --> 29:49.164
Edo has his own commando regiment there.

30:09.977 --> 30:11.520
And how do I get in there?

30:11.603 --> 30:14.106
No one gets in, not even the government.

30:18.068 --> 30:19.444
Fucking Baba.

30:22.155 --> 30:24.575
You think it was wise
to take Lord Harlan's house?

30:24.658 --> 30:26.994
I am the queen. The queen
should live in the highest house.

30:27.077 --> 30:28.954
Even a queen needs her allies.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.498
Our situation here is tenuous at best.

30:31.582 --> 30:34.710
Until the destruction of Kanzua
has been satisfactorily explained,

30:34.793 --> 30:35.794
we are vulnerable.

30:35.878 --> 30:38.297
-You worry too much.
-You don't worry enough.

30:38.839 --> 30:41.008
Your people have already
turned on you once.

30:41.091 --> 30:44.052
Lord Harlan controls the army,
and we will need his protection,

30:44.136 --> 30:46.638
-especially when we announce the new law--
-Enough.

30:47.514 --> 30:52.186
Harlan was a lowly courtier
who managed to become the Lord of Pennsa.

30:52.686 --> 30:56.023
I don't know how he did it.
Most likely not by being an idiot.

30:56.565 --> 31:00.360
Show a man like Harlan any weakness,
and he will own you.

31:01.528 --> 31:02.571
Remember that.

31:49.993 --> 31:53.121
You need to take greater care
in your dealings with Lord Harlan.

31:54.456 --> 31:57.167
We need him
and the leadership on our side.

31:58.669 --> 32:00.087
I am their queen.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.507
What other side can they be on?

32:03.590 --> 32:08.470
I'm just saying a beloved monarch
can achieve much more than a despised one.

32:09.221 --> 32:10.973
You're talking about your children.

32:11.473 --> 32:13.892
I made you a promise, Maghra.
You think I won't keep it?

32:13.976 --> 32:16.478
-I'm suggesting you curry favor…
-A queen doesn't curry favor.

32:16.562 --> 32:18.647
…with the leadership
while Kanzua remains unexplained.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.441
I don't have to explain anything
to anyone.

32:21.525 --> 32:24.152
Your Majesty,
Lord Harlan and Captain Gosset.

32:24.236 --> 32:25.571
I'll receive them.

32:26.780 --> 32:27.781
Leave us.

32:30.158 --> 32:31.785
What will you say about Kanzua?

32:32.703 --> 32:34.997
I'll decide what needs to be said
and that's what I'll say.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.624
Whatever lie you tell
becomes my lie as well.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.877
If the queen says it, it's not a lie.

32:40.377 --> 32:43.046
Lord Harlan. Who have you brought?

32:43.547 --> 32:45.215
My queen. Princess.

32:46.216 --> 32:50.012
Allow me to present Captain Gosset,
Pennsa's chief military officer.

32:53.724 --> 32:55.559
It is an honor, my queen.

32:55.642 --> 32:59.188
The attack at Kanzua
was an unprecedented abomination.

32:59.271 --> 33:00.272
Yes.

33:00.355 --> 33:02.816
We've been on full military alert
since we heard.

33:03.775 --> 33:07.237
I expect a full readiness report
on your fortifications here tomorrow.

33:07.321 --> 33:08.780
And you shall have it.

33:08.864 --> 33:12.534
As the only witness,
if you could tell us who our enemy is,

33:12.618 --> 33:15.329
-it would surely help us prepare.
-I can.

33:16.413 --> 33:17.748
And I will, in due time.

33:17.831 --> 33:18.957
Call up your council.

33:19.041 --> 33:21.043
I'll meet with them
at the earliest opportunity.

33:21.126 --> 33:22.252
Yes, Your Majesty.

33:22.878 --> 33:25.088
I have a separate issue
that is of the utmost importance.

33:25.172 --> 33:26.423
-Maghra.
-Princess?

33:26.507 --> 33:30.219
You hunted them for 17 years.
You can search a little longer.

33:30.302 --> 33:31.303
Fair enough.

33:33.472 --> 33:35.224
My family and I were separated.

33:35.307 --> 33:38.519
I will need every soldier you can spare
to continue the search for them.

33:39.102 --> 33:41.188
We shall leave no stone unturned.

33:41.271 --> 33:42.272
Thank you.

33:42.773 --> 33:45.567
I will accompany you
to give the soldiers the mandate.

33:54.952 --> 33:56.411
The things we do for family.

33:56.912 --> 33:57.996
Yeah…

34:00.832 --> 34:01.875
I trust…

34:04.211 --> 34:07.172
you and your sister
find the accommodation to your liking?

34:08.674 --> 34:09.675
Yes.

34:11.760 --> 34:16.348
And now, I take it
we're going to have a real conversation.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.603
It stands to reason,
following the attack on Kanzua,

34:22.688 --> 34:24.565
we would want to shore up our defenses.

34:24.648 --> 34:28.694
And yet you've just agreed to send
valuable soldiers out of the city.

34:30.654 --> 34:35.409
Unless perhaps you have reason
not to fear a second attack.

34:37.077 --> 34:38.620
We are well fortified here.

34:39.329 --> 34:42.416
Pennsa has the largest regiment in Paya,
does it not?

34:43.583 --> 34:45.335
It's one of the reasons I chose it.

34:46.587 --> 34:49.255
I thought it's 'cause you knew
you had a friend in me.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.010
Am I in need of your friendship?

34:54.219 --> 34:57.764
Well, there are whispers, my queen.

34:59.224 --> 35:00.559
Whispers.

35:00.642 --> 35:03.562
Yeah, it's no secret
that the nobility of Kanzua

35:03.645 --> 35:05.397
were mobilizing against you.

35:06.356 --> 35:07.900
Be very careful, Harlan.

35:07.983 --> 35:09.526
I always am, my queen.

35:11.653 --> 35:13.697
My devotion to you is unassailable,

35:13.780 --> 35:15.949
but Pennsa's a big city.

35:16.033 --> 35:18.660
Lot of factions,
lot of people of influence.

35:19.703 --> 35:21.246
They have their suspicions.

35:24.416 --> 35:25.417
I can only assume

35:25.501 --> 35:28.587
you're working your way towards
something resembling a point.

35:28.670 --> 35:30.589
It's the same one I made before.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.841
You've got a friend in me.

35:35.594 --> 35:37.137
I can be a very good one.

35:37.221 --> 35:40.724
I'll keep that in mind.
Now if there's nothing else, leave me.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.937
I'm still learning my way
around my new palace.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.524
My queen.

35:59.076 --> 36:00.077
Boots.

36:01.745 --> 36:02.871
Yes, Queen?

36:04.206 --> 36:06.208
You can see. Do I look well?

36:09.044 --> 36:10.504
You look beautiful.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.509
Do I look like I want you around?

36:20.055 --> 36:21.139
Leave me!

36:47.541 --> 36:48.584
Kerrigan.

36:53.255 --> 36:55.090
And how was the queen?

36:55.883 --> 36:59.428
Every bit as cunning
and dangerous as I remember.

37:00.345 --> 37:01.805
Sounds like my kind of woman.

37:03.932 --> 37:05.017
And the sister?

37:05.100 --> 37:06.727
Haven't figured her out yet,

37:06.810 --> 37:09.479
but there's an intriguing disharmony
between the two.

37:10.939 --> 37:12.191
Something's off.

37:12.941 --> 37:14.818
-What is it?
-I don't know.

37:15.569 --> 37:16.945
Could be worth discovering.

37:19.031 --> 37:23.744
Either way, I'll no doubt require
the leverage we discussed.

37:24.745 --> 37:25.996
You know where he is?

37:27.456 --> 37:30.626
He is being delivered as we speak.

37:30.709 --> 37:31.710
Good.

37:32.461 --> 37:34.046
In the meantime,

37:34.129 --> 37:38.425
it seems the High Lord of Pennsa
has been expelled from his own bedroom.

37:38.509 --> 37:39.510
Yep.

37:40.594 --> 37:42.971
Not coincidentally,
so has his younger brother.

37:44.473 --> 37:46.099
I had a feeling you'd say that.

37:59.196 --> 38:03.283
God Flame. Protect our Haniwa.

38:05.077 --> 38:06.870
Baba Voss, her father.

38:08.872 --> 38:11.124
Deliver them whole to us.

38:12.751 --> 38:15.712
Deliver them in peace to us.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.881
Give--

38:19.132 --> 38:20.133
Hello?

38:24.555 --> 38:25.556
Hello?

38:26.181 --> 38:28.767
You're not out here all alone, are you?

38:29.768 --> 38:32.062
I could ask the same thing of you.

38:32.145 --> 38:34.147
But you are not alone, are you?

38:34.982 --> 38:36.275
No, I'm not--

38:38.902 --> 38:41.280
Witchfinders. We have to go now.

38:54.418 --> 38:55.419
Shit.

38:56.962 --> 38:57.880
Don't move.

38:57.963 --> 39:00.257
-Haniwa.
-It's time for me to go.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.885
-You'll never make it out of the city.
-Then it'll be a short trip.

39:02.968 --> 39:05.554
Now, we're gonna walk over
to that leg shackle--

39:07.389 --> 39:08.682
Fuck.

39:22.362 --> 39:24.531
-I don't wanna hurt you.
-Then let me go.

39:24.615 --> 39:26.241
I don't want to do that either.

39:42.174 --> 39:43.175
Fuck!

40:11.787 --> 40:13.247
That's enough.

40:15.582 --> 40:18.418
What are Witchfinders doing
this far from the capital?

40:18.502 --> 40:20.170
We're searching for two Alkenny siblings,

40:20.254 --> 40:22.881
-Haniwa and Kofun.
-We are not them.

40:22.965 --> 40:24.633
Our dogs smell otherwise.

40:30.347 --> 40:31.849
-This is Kofun.
-No, I'm not.

40:31.932 --> 40:32.975
Leave him be.

40:33.517 --> 40:36.603
The years in your voice
tell me that you are not Haniwa.

40:36.687 --> 40:39.565
-So, where is she?
-She is not with us.

40:39.648 --> 40:41.024
Well, one's better than none.

40:41.108 --> 40:43.193
-By order of Princess Maghra…
-Maghra?

40:43.277 --> 40:45.362
…you are to return with us
to Pennsa immediately.

40:45.445 --> 40:48.490
What are you talking about?
She's not-- Princess? She's dead.

40:48.574 --> 40:51.785
I assure you she is both alive
and the sister of Queen Kane.

40:51.869 --> 40:52.870
You're lying.

41:00.419 --> 41:01.628
He speaks truth.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.464
-What?
-She's alive.

41:05.966 --> 41:07.759
Maghra is alive.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.804
-What?
-We need to move. Now.

41:10.888 --> 41:11.889
You're sure?

41:11.972 --> 41:14.725
I felt her life force on him
very strongly.

41:14.808 --> 41:17.311
Thank you for confirming
that which was never in doubt.

41:17.394 --> 41:18.604
-Now let's go.
-Wait, no!

41:18.687 --> 41:21.732
Wait, wait, we can't leave.
We're waiting for someone.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.276
Is it Haniwa?

41:24.359 --> 41:27.571
Yes, and my father. They'll be here soon.

41:27.654 --> 41:30.699
-We go now.
-No, we can't leave without them.

41:30.782 --> 41:33.577
We can't stay. It's too dangerous.

41:33.660 --> 41:35.662
Now, you can come willingly,

41:35.746 --> 41:38.123
or you can come
bound to the back of my horse.

41:38.624 --> 41:39.625
Make your choice.

41:41.710 --> 41:43.712
-Paris…
-Maghra is alive.

41:43.795 --> 41:45.631
Kofun, go to your mother.

41:45.714 --> 41:47.508
I will wait here for Baba and Haniwa.

41:47.591 --> 41:49.343
I'm not leaving you here alone.

41:50.594 --> 41:52.221
I will not be alone.

41:53.055 --> 41:54.348
Go to her.

41:54.431 --> 41:55.516
Go now.

42:21.834 --> 42:24.628
Lord Harlan. You may come in.

42:24.711 --> 42:26.505
You knew me from my knock.

42:27.297 --> 42:29.299
Or from your gait coming up the stairs.

42:30.217 --> 42:32.636
Yes, I forgot. You're an Ayura.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.099
And please, within these walls,
no boring formalities.

42:38.475 --> 42:39.601
Call me Harlan.

42:41.103 --> 42:43.605
Well, I assume you want to call me Maghra.

42:44.106 --> 42:46.316
It's what I called you
when we were children.

42:46.400 --> 42:50.070
-Well, we're not children anymore.
-'Course we are.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.826
Just sadder, angrier ones as we age.

42:59.538 --> 43:03.417
I come bearing a gift
for the child within.

43:17.681 --> 43:18.974
A sound wand.

43:23.604 --> 43:25.522
I haven't had one of these in years.

43:29.193 --> 43:33.113
I recall you always enjoyed
playing with those.

43:34.072 --> 43:35.199
Yeah.

43:36.283 --> 43:39.411
They were the only thing
that would quiet the noise in my head.

43:44.082 --> 43:46.126
Thank you, Harlan.

43:46.210 --> 43:49.087
It was the least I could do, Maghra.

43:49.171 --> 43:51.340
After my sister took your home, you mean?

43:51.924 --> 43:55.552
Everything I do is in service
of the queen.

43:55.636 --> 43:56.970
As I recall it,

43:57.054 --> 44:00.307
everything you ever did
was always in service of yourself.

44:00.891 --> 44:04.353
Well, it seems we both have long memories.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.066
Tell me…

44:10.526 --> 44:12.486
were you in Kanzua when it was attacked?

44:14.363 --> 44:15.739
-No.
-No?

44:16.990 --> 44:21.119
So… no witnesses then?

44:22.996 --> 44:26.875
First you drop our titles,
and now you're flirting with treason?

44:26.959 --> 44:29.002
Oh, you'd know about that.

44:29.086 --> 44:30.963
You're the one who rose up
against your sister

44:31.046 --> 44:32.881
and tried to take the throne for yourself.

44:32.965 --> 44:35.676
But then no one heard from me
for 18 years,

44:36.176 --> 44:37.970
so there may be a lesson in that.

44:39.429 --> 44:40.430
Indeed.

44:42.850 --> 44:44.268
Where were you, by the way?

44:44.351 --> 44:48.230
You know, that is a very long story
for this very short visit.

44:49.022 --> 44:50.148
Fair enough.

44:51.483 --> 44:53.652
We'll find time for it one of these days.

44:57.865 --> 44:59.324
If you don't mind me saying,

45:00.993 --> 45:02.953
you would have made an excellent queen.

45:10.169 --> 45:13.338
Dear and holy citizens of Pennsa,

45:13.922 --> 45:16.175
may God Flame warm your hearts.

45:18.177 --> 45:23.348
I stand humbly before you today
as a soul reborn through hardship.

45:24.308 --> 45:26.727
Through sorrow. Through death.

45:28.145 --> 45:30.772
Grateful, now more than ever,
for your faith,

45:31.899 --> 45:32.983
your love…

45:34.359 --> 45:35.360
Maghra?

45:35.444 --> 45:38.113
-…and the purpose you have bestowed me.
-I'm here.

45:39.239 --> 45:40.532
What's going on?

45:41.074 --> 45:42.951
-We…
-Consecration's scheduled in three days.

45:43.035 --> 45:44.453
-We agreed.
-…are…

45:44.536 --> 45:46.246
-I've been making arrangements.
-…chosen.

45:46.330 --> 45:48.624
She woke up this morning
and decided something else.

45:48.707 --> 45:49.708
She does that.

45:50.542 --> 45:55.214
Our beloved capital city of Kanzua,
where my father ruled,

45:55.297 --> 45:58.008
and his father,
and his grandfather before him,

45:58.592 --> 46:02.137
is no more.

46:06.808 --> 46:12.189
I bore witness to the cries of my people
as they drowned.

46:16.485 --> 46:20.697
Children crying out for their mothers.
Men for their wives.

46:22.241 --> 46:24.368
I was prepared to die with them,

46:25.035 --> 46:28.372
but God had another plan for me.

46:30.958 --> 46:33.710
I felt her flame burning inside of me,

46:33.794 --> 46:37.297
warming me as she carried me
away from certain death

46:37.965 --> 46:40.342
to reunite me with my sister.

46:42.761 --> 46:47.516
Princess Maghra,
lost to us for all these years.

46:47.599 --> 46:49.351
And it is the same god…

46:50.769 --> 46:52.688
The only true god…

46:54.648 --> 46:56.567
who brought us here today

46:56.650 --> 47:02.281
to consecrate the city of Pennsa
as the new capital of the Payan kingdom.

47:08.954 --> 47:10.497
My dear Payans,

47:11.373 --> 47:15.836
know now that what you have
probably feared is true.

47:17.796 --> 47:21.925
It was the Trivantian army
who murdered our people…

47:23.302 --> 47:24.970
and destroyed Kanzua.

47:25.971 --> 47:27.556
Fuck.

47:27.639 --> 47:29.641
And now I will tell you why.

47:31.351 --> 47:33.103
Their spies informed them…

47:35.105 --> 47:37.232
that I carry within me a child.

47:39.610 --> 47:41.778
A child who will change everything.

47:43.947 --> 47:48.660
As he or she will be born
with God's gift of vision.

47:57.461 --> 48:00.506
I know it is hard to accept
something so contrary

48:01.006 --> 48:03.133
to the doctrines of our forefathers.

48:05.093 --> 48:07.304
But I have heard the voice of God…

48:09.223 --> 48:13.143
and God joined her spirit to mine
and brought me back to life

48:13.227 --> 48:18.190
so that I might unite all Payans
to defeat our enemy in the west,

48:18.273 --> 48:20.484
once and for all.

48:26.657 --> 48:31.036
Our victory has been foretold,
and it will be swift.

48:32.454 --> 48:38.544
As we are chosen to safeguard
these blessed children as they come,

48:38.627 --> 48:43.340
and they will come,
to usher in a new world.

48:43.423 --> 48:47.469
A world in which those with sight
and those without

48:47.553 --> 48:51.723
live together in harmony under my rule.

48:52.724 --> 48:55.602
For we are Payan!

48:56.228 --> 49:01.984
We are Payan

49:08.657 --> 49:10.742
Have you ever been
down to the coal hub before?

49:10.826 --> 49:11.827
No.

49:12.786 --> 49:14.288
They don't like visitors.

49:14.371 --> 49:17.082
Stay close to the walls.
Keep away from the pits.

49:17.165 --> 49:19.960
-Snell will be waiting for you.
-Snell.

49:20.043 --> 49:23.172
Here, give him this.
He'll show you the right tunnel.

49:24.173 --> 49:26.008
Now you move through as fast as you can.

49:26.091 --> 49:29.344
If you breathe in that heat,
you'll burn to death from the inside.

49:34.683 --> 49:35.767
Thanks, Yakis.

49:36.643 --> 49:38.645
-You're probably going to die.
-Nah.

50:55.347 --> 50:58.141
Hello, friend. You have something for me?

51:04.147 --> 51:05.232
Let's go.

51:28.463 --> 51:31.800
This tunnel will put you
right under base three, all right?

51:31.884 --> 51:34.720
But a man won't last
more than 30 heartbeats in that heat.

51:34.803 --> 51:37.139
So move fast, or you'll be cooked alive.

51:39.975 --> 51:41.018
Good luck.

52:17.804 --> 52:18.847
Sibeth.

52:19.806 --> 52:22.351
-What have you done?
-What we discussed.

52:22.434 --> 52:25.729
We never discussed a baby. With Boots?

52:25.812 --> 52:28.232
Don't judge.
He was brought to me for a reason.

52:28.732 --> 52:31.026
You can't even know
your baby will be sighted.

52:31.109 --> 52:32.402
Not until it's born.

52:32.486 --> 52:33.779
You can't know. I can.

52:34.279 --> 52:36.031
Honestly, Maghra,
I thought you'd be happy.

52:36.114 --> 52:38.283
If not for me, for you.

52:38.367 --> 52:40.035
Your children are no longer witches.

52:40.118 --> 52:43.580
Well, that won't matter when we're all
slaughtered by the Trivantians.

52:44.414 --> 52:45.666
You're being hysterical.

52:46.708 --> 52:48.502
You agreed we would rule together.

52:48.585 --> 52:50.629
I said I would rule with you by my side,

52:51.213 --> 52:53.465
-and here you are.
-It doesn't matter where I stand

52:53.549 --> 52:55.592
if you just continue to act
without consulting me.

52:55.676 --> 52:58.262
And if I would have sought your counsel,
what would you have said?

52:58.345 --> 53:01.515
I'd have said that waging war
with Trivantes is madness.

53:01.598 --> 53:03.725
And that announcing
a sighted baby upon arrival

53:03.809 --> 53:06.603
makes you and me
vulnerable to a revolution.

53:07.187 --> 53:08.897
I'd have said that with one speech,

53:08.981 --> 53:11.149
you've found two different ways
to get us killed.

53:11.233 --> 53:13.235
And I would have given the same speech
all the same.

53:13.318 --> 53:14.403
-Sibeth.
-Maghra.

53:14.903 --> 53:18.240
There can only ever be one queen,
and she is me.

53:19.032 --> 53:21.660
This is where a wise woman
would listen and learn,

53:21.743 --> 53:24.288
instead of assuming
she knows how to run a kingdom

53:24.371 --> 53:28.083
so that someday she might actually
have some counsel worth offering.

53:30.836 --> 53:35.340
I am taking care of you… sister.

53:38.093 --> 53:39.386
As I always did.

54:43.992 --> 54:45.160
Hello, friend.

54:47.746 --> 54:50.541
Sorry, it looks like
I sent you up the wrong tunnel.

54:50.624 --> 54:52.334
Smithy, are you sure this is Baba Voss?

54:52.417 --> 54:54.127
I heard him and Yakis talking.

54:54.211 --> 54:55.504
Well then,

54:55.587 --> 54:58.549
we're just gonna wait right here
for the general's men

54:58.632 --> 55:00.300
and collect our reward.

55:04.054 --> 55:05.055
Something funny?

55:06.765 --> 55:08.350
Dead men thinking they're getting paid.

55:08.433 --> 55:10.227
What the hell are you talking about?

55:38.005 --> 55:39.006
Smithy.

55:40.799 --> 55:41.967
Smithy.

55:42.050 --> 55:44.553
You could get out now
before the soldiers get here.

55:45.053 --> 55:46.054
It's too late.

55:51.935 --> 55:53.187
No one move.

55:53.270 --> 55:55.731
Baba Voss, you are to surrender at on--

56:05.991 --> 56:06.992
Halt.

56:18.128 --> 56:19.129
Fan out!

56:20.506 --> 56:21.882
Surround him!

57:02.965 --> 57:04.091
He's here!

57:05.551 --> 57:06.885
One left turn!

57:09.596 --> 57:11.348
To the left. Move out.

57:18.355 --> 57:20.566
He's moving towards the square!

57:36.039 --> 57:38.041
-Quiet, boy.
-Okay.

57:38.125 --> 57:39.585
Cover the streets and alleys!

57:42.588 --> 57:45.549
He's in the alley going towards the river.

58:11.950 --> 58:18.332
Stand upon ye Mother
Directed by the God Flame

58:20.918 --> 58:23.462
Protecting all ye children

58:24.755 --> 58:31.595
And all together
Ye sisters and ye daughters

58:32.137 --> 58:34.556
Stand upon ye Mother

58:36.892 --> 58:38.602
Directed by the God--

58:41.563 --> 58:43.065
I can hear you.

58:45.192 --> 58:49.029
And I can smell you.
So you might as well come out.

58:59.748 --> 59:01.500
Now who wants tea?

59:36.326 --> 59:37.452
Greetings, brother.

59:39.162 --> 59:40.163
Edo.

59:43.125 --> 59:44.501
The mighty Baba Voss.

59:44.585 --> 59:49.256
Slaughterer of Ganites by the dozens.
Murderer of his own father.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.717
Chained like a common slave.

59:52.426 --> 59:55.804
All because he could not bring himself
to kill a boy.

59:57.181 --> 59:58.849
It's almost disappointing.

1:00:00.309 --> 1:00:01.476
Please, brother.

1:00:02.603 --> 1:00:03.770
My daughter…

1:00:05.105 --> 1:00:06.106
Your daughter?

1:00:06.940 --> 1:00:10.861
Your daughter? You mean
Jerlamarel's daughter, don't you?

1:00:12.529 --> 1:00:16.158
Please. Just let her go.

1:00:16.241 --> 1:00:17.951
-"Please"?
-She has nothing to do…

1:00:18.035 --> 1:00:19.745
-"Please." I just--
-…with the both of us.

1:00:19.828 --> 1:00:22.414
So strange hearing compassion
in your voice.

1:00:25.501 --> 1:00:30.714
I remember a time when I prayed
for just a hint of compassion from you.

1:00:38.639 --> 1:00:42.476
I'm sorry.
I spent my whole life regretting

1:00:42.559 --> 1:00:45.187
-what I've done to you. I--
-Shut up!

1:00:52.945 --> 1:00:53.987
Don't worry.

1:00:55.864 --> 1:00:57.824
We'll have plenty of time to catch up.

1:01:01.578 --> 1:01:02.579
Begin.

1:01:04.456 --> 1:01:05.457
Edo.

1:01:07.209 --> 1:01:08.210
Edo.

1:01:09.711 --> 1:01:11.046
Just let her go.

1:01:21.473 --> 1:01:23.851
Edo!
