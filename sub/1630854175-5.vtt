Good morning, baby.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.668
I got these 'cause I figured
you was gonna be real thirsty

00:16.668 --> 00:19.671
after all that sweet, sweet love
we made last night.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.847
Simone, what the hell
are you talking about?

00:21.847 --> 00:23.327
Just go with it.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.068
It's our undercover backstory
I made up.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.201
See,
I'm in a loveless marriage,

00:27.201 --> 00:29.333
and I'm having this torrid
affair with my accountant.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.987
That's you, by the way. Stop.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.771
You are doing way too much
right now.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.295
Backstories?

00:34.295 --> 00:35.557
And your getup.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.341
Where-- Where'd you get
this hair?

00:37.341 --> 00:39.561
Don't say nothing
about Felicia.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.084
You know damn well
she cute.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.478
Relax, Carter. Damn.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.741
You still a suit
even with your legs out.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.569
While you're all caught up in
this ridiculous backstory,

00:47.569 --> 00:48.874
let's review
the real one.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.876
Why are we here?

00:50.876 --> 00:54.228
To extradite Bernie Barlowe
back to the U.S.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.969
to testify against
Nugenius Industries.

00:56.969 --> 01:00.364
He was their head I.T. guy,
and he defied a subpoena

01:00.364 --> 01:02.192
and fled the country
three months ago.

01:02.192 --> 01:05.369
And might I say
you good, Carter.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.371
Good morning, Special Agent.

01:07.371 --> 01:10.331
Oh, mes ami,
an island queen.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.550
Mm. Belle chérie.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.378
Good morning,
Inspector Denby. Morning.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.250
Why-- Why-- Why--
Why are you in uniform?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.773
I told you I want this
to be a covert op.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.384
Nobody cares about
what you want, G-man.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.125
You have
no jurisdiction here.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.996
Remember, you surrendered
your badge and your gun

01:23.996 --> 01:27.522
at the airport
along with your opinions.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.132
This is my operation.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.526
Wait, wait.
There he is right there.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.397
Suspect spotted.
Move in, move in, move in.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.398
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't want to spook him.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.399
Relax. Trust me.

01:35.399 --> 01:36.313
Wah!

01:40.143 --> 01:41.536
- Aah!
- Whoa!

01:52.155 --> 01:53.635
FBI! Stop running!

01:53.635 --> 01:55.071
Stop chasing!

01:58.205 --> 02:00.032
Okay.
I, uh-- I give...

02:00.032 --> 02:02.774
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:02.774 --> 02:04.907
God.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.606
Wait.
Go ahead, boo.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.347
Catch your breath...

02:10.347 --> 02:12.349
'cause
you're under arrest.

02:13.394 --> 02:18.355
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

02:19.530 --> 02:20.792
Hey, Carter.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.229
<i>Oh, good.
Allen, you're there.</i>

02:22.229 --> 02:24.056
Tell me you caught
more than a tan, buddy.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.580
No tan, but I did figure out
what to get

02:25.580 --> 02:27.103
my favorite
Assistant U.S. Attorney

02:27.103 --> 02:28.191
<i>for his retirement gift.</i>

02:30.106 --> 02:31.238
<i>Say hello, Bernie.</i>

02:31.238 --> 02:33.327
<i>I hate you all.</i>

02:33.327 --> 02:35.242
Be nice. It's not their fault
you're stupid.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.200
<i>Fantastic work, Carter.</i>

02:37.200 --> 02:38.332
The other two witnesses
are ready to testify.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.681
Barlowe's the last piece.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.639
Now we can take Nugenius
all the way down.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.859
What a way to sail off
into the sunset.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.426
<i>My government pension
is more like</i>

02:45.426 --> 02:47.210
<i>fishing off a kayak
in a muddy river.</i>

02:47.210 --> 02:49.125
G-man. Come.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.214
The extradition papers
are ready for your signature.

02:51.214 --> 02:54.043
<i>Gotta go. We'll be
on the next flight out of here.</i>

02:54.043 --> 02:55.436
I'll call you as soon
as they arrive.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.785
Hey, I appreciate
your help on this, Matt.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.134
Of course.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.877
Oh,
that's a nice purse.

03:01.877 --> 03:04.053
Oh, Tío,
you sound so old.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.228
It's a handbag.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.751
Okay.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.711
Is there a problem?

03:09.711 --> 03:11.800
More of
an ethical dilemma.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.497
I bought this
from an online reseller.

03:13.497 --> 03:16.283
It came with a warranty,
a letter of authenticity,

03:16.283 --> 03:18.459
and five big, fat diamonds

03:18.459 --> 03:20.243
that were sticking
out of the lining.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.244
Are these real?

03:21.244 --> 03:22.680
Yes.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.421
Can I keep them?
No.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.471
Um, how much
to, uh, let me go?

03:30.471 --> 03:33.300
You're in enough trouble
already fleeing the country.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.693
Don't add attempted bribery
of a federal agent.

03:38.348 --> 03:41.090
My twins made me bracelets like
that when they were in camp.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.526
How old's your kid?

03:42.526 --> 03:43.658
She's 14 now.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.616
But when she gave me this,
she was 9.

03:45.616 --> 03:48.489
You really thought that running
was a good idea?

03:48.489 --> 03:50.360
Better than being
forced to testify.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.144
Which I'm not doing,
by the way.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.321
- Oh, yeah, you are.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.975
So you might as well let me go, please.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.455
Come on, I'm living
the dream down here.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.283
Really?

04:00.283 --> 04:02.720
'Cause you were day drinking
alone at 9:00 a.m.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.506
And if that's the dream,
you better wake up.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.508
Don't you miss
your daughter?

04:09.074 --> 04:12.339
Hey, uh, D, don't judge
the hair. I'm at work.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.559
I only got a quick second,
but I'm happy to see your face.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.734
<i>Well, I hope you still
feel the same way</i>

04:16.734 --> 04:18.345
<i>after I tell you
why I called.</i>

04:18.345 --> 04:19.998
What's wrong? <i>How serious were you</i>

04:19.998 --> 04:22.523
<i>about keeping our dating
a secret from your pops?</i>

04:22.523 --> 04:25.308
'Cause I kinda sorta
mentioned it to my mom.
What?

04:25.308 --> 04:28.311
<i>Sneaking around makes me feel
like I'm 15 and in the closet.</i>

04:28.311 --> 04:30.008
It's not like that.
Okay?

04:30.008 --> 04:31.314
My dad
is uncomfortable with me

04:31.314 --> 04:33.360
dating the daughter
of a woman he's dating.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.231
My mom's
pretty cool with it.

04:35.231 --> 04:36.537
I mean,
your dad might be, too.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.321
<i>Well, I guess we about
to find out,</i>

04:38.321 --> 04:40.367
<i>because I have to tell him
before your mom does,</i>

04:40.367 --> 04:42.369
<i>or it's gonna be
- extra drama.
- My bad.</i>

04:42.369 --> 04:43.718
I didn't mean to-- <i>You know what?</i>

04:43.718 --> 04:45.023
I gotta go.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.503
I-I gotta call him.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.331
We are officially
done here.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.464
What's wrong?
Nothing.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.595
She's been lying
to her daddy.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.467
Wow.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.338
You won't testify against
your crooked-ass employer,

04:55.338 --> 04:57.035
but you're ready to drop dime
on me.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.602
Get in the car.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.387
I will escort you
to the airport.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.389
Follow me.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.042
- Let's go.
- Ow, ow.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.355
This is
completely unacceptable.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.052
Your case notes
are absurd.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.402
"Mr. Jenkins confessed,

05:15.402 --> 05:17.404
and though his steely eyes
stayed cold,

05:17.404 --> 05:20.015
his heart cried
like a newborn baby"?

05:20.015 --> 05:21.712
It's an FBI case report,

05:21.712 --> 05:22.800
not fan fiction.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.193
Stick to the facts.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.412
The facts are all there.

05:25.412 --> 05:28.197
There's just
a hint of panache.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.894
Like Antoinette's
lab coat.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.854
Hi.

05:34.812 --> 05:35.813
Hi.
Hey.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.206
You're both needed
in the fishbowl.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.512
How'd you know
we were in the elevator?

05:38.512 --> 05:39.948
I know everything.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.602
Oh. Sorry.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.430
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.476
I don't get it.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.044
Every time I say anything to
her, she just ices me out.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.393
She doesn't like anyone.

05:50.393 --> 05:53.614
So please put away your actor-y
need to be loved,

05:53.614 --> 05:55.964
and do not try to charm her,
you'll only piss her off.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.183
The last thing we want is for
when our unit needs lab results,

05:58.183 --> 06:00.055
we take a nose dive
down the priority list.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.405
She wouldn't do that,
would she?

06:02.405 --> 06:05.756
Brendon, you can't
win everyone over.

06:05.756 --> 06:06.583
Challenge accepted.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.675
Hey, boss.
Nice, uh, handbag.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.068
It's mine.
Pretty fly, right?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.504
Bought it
on The Frillest.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.637
- Oh, what's that?
- You don't know?

06:16.637 --> 06:19.248
It's the top online retailer
of high-end stuff.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.467
- Oh.
- After it was delivered,

06:20.467 --> 06:23.470
I found those
- poking through the lining.
- Wow.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.646
And I thought I got the hookup
when I bought a handbag

06:25.646 --> 06:27.648
and got a sunglasses case
for free.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.519
Does something look odd
about the stitching

06:29.519 --> 06:31.347
on this panel here?

06:33.697 --> 06:34.785
Oh!

06:34.785 --> 06:35.656
I know you didn't
just rip my bag.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.227
Someone sewed hidden pouches
into this thing.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.142
Tío.
Oh.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.143
Bingo. Yeah.

06:47.537 --> 06:51.628
Wow. That has got to be
hundreds of thousands of dollars

06:51.628 --> 06:53.021
worth of diamonds, right?

06:53.021 --> 06:54.718
Why didn't I
keep this to myself?

06:54.718 --> 06:57.460
Okay, we need to figure
out what's going on here.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.506
Elena, contact this website
and get the seller's name.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.246
In the meantime,
bring those to the lab,

07:01.246 --> 07:03.684
because people who are on
the right side of the law

07:03.684 --> 07:05.555
usually don't hide diamonds
like this.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.383
Okay,
but no more ripping?

07:07.383 --> 07:09.820
That bag cost me
$2,000.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.562
$2,000? Elena.

07:15.609 --> 07:16.610
Oh, you know what?
She's on the phone.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.959
Let's just
come back later.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.874
Hey, hey. Where you going?
We're working a case.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.745
Let's go. Oh...

07:21.745 --> 07:23.355
Are you afraid of her?

07:23.355 --> 07:24.748
No.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.924
Yes, you are.
No, just--
Okay, be cool.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.535
Cool is my middle name.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.666
If it were,
you wouldn't have said that.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.674
Antoinette.
Hi.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.721
We have some possibly illicit
diamonds for you to look at.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.505
Or if this is
a bad time?

07:42.505 --> 07:43.767
No.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.428
See that?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.561
Every legit diamond in the U.S.
is graded by the GIA

07:54.561 --> 07:57.999
- and given a serial number.
- Wow. Awesome.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.871
- Who knew?
- You, one would assume,

08:00.871 --> 08:03.657
given that you're
an FBI special agent.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.615
Ignore him. He's new.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.356
Please, go on.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.664
This diamond,
and I'm assuming all the others,

08:10.664 --> 08:12.753
were stolen from
an armed courier near L.A.X.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.798
four months ago.

08:14.798 --> 08:19.586
Reported to be worth
approximately...$2 million.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.806
LAPD's been puzzling
over this heist for months.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.547
An armed courier picks up
a shipment of diamonds

08:24.547 --> 08:25.940
from a private plane.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.942
They come across
our first unsub,

08:27.942 --> 08:30.422
a woman lying facedown
on the street.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.947
He gets out to check on her
when our second unsub,

08:32.947 --> 08:37.038
another woman wearing a mask,
comes out of nowhere, tases him.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.692
They grab the diamonds
and they're gone in
less than a minute.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.782
Hmm. An all-female heist crew. Respect.

08:41.782 --> 08:45.002
Except somehow the stash ended
up hidden in Elena's purse.

08:45.002 --> 08:48.179
Speaking of, the online reseller
responded to the warrant.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.790
We got the name of
the original seller.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.356
Denise Palmer.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.053
She's gotta be
one of the robbers.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.402
Let's get her
in here now.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.622
We can't.
She's dead.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.928
Shot and killed in front of
her own home

08:57.928 --> 08:59.408
the night of
the diamond heist.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.627
Well, it could have been
a double-cross.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.716
Think about it.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.805
They have a falling out,
the partner kills Denise,

09:04.805 --> 09:06.284
and didn't know
where she hid the diamonds.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.591
- It's very film noir.
- Hope I'm wrong.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.375
I hate it when women
backstab each other.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.421
Guess then the only question
left is,

09:12.421 --> 09:14.510
if this Denise Palmer has been
dead for four months,

09:14.510 --> 09:17.992
then how did she sell Elena
her handbag?

09:17.992 --> 09:20.734
♪ Ooh-ah De La Geezy, homie.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.474

'Cause I'm-- I am starving.

09:30.787 --> 09:33.790
You ever have pigeon peas soup
with ackee and tree mutton?

09:33.790 --> 09:35.966
I know it-- it sounds like
roadkill soufflé,

09:35.966 --> 09:38.708
but it is delicious.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.450
You know, there's a-a great spot
where they, uh--I'll make you a deal.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.540
Stop talking and I give you
my peanuts on the plane.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.281
Thanks,
but I'm allergic to nuts...

09:46.281 --> 09:47.804
and prison.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.285
So could we, um,
maybe not be in such a hurry

09:50.285 --> 09:51.895
to take me back
to the U.S.?

09:51.895 --> 09:53.984
I thought you'd want to get back
to see your daughter.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.725
If my ex
lets her visit me.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.248
Before I skipped town,

09:57.248 --> 09:58.902
I only got to see her
once every other week.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.251
Tough divorce?

10:00.251 --> 10:02.036
Eh, it was my fault.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.125
I gave my life to
Nugenius Industries

10:04.125 --> 10:06.257
and was never around.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.869
It's gotta be more than
that if your ex-wife
has sole custody.

10:08.869 --> 10:12.046
Well, I cheated on her...
a lot.

10:12.046 --> 10:15.658
And I had a teeny,
tiny gambling problem.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.312
How teeny, tiny?

10:17.312 --> 10:21.882
I lost our house
betting on a llama race.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.320
Wait.
Where's Denby going?

10:32.893 --> 10:35.025
Denby just sold us out.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.157
We don't have
our weapons.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.812
Open up!
Give us Barlowe! Now!

10:43.077 --> 10:44.556
Okay. Okay.
Stay cool.

10:44.556 --> 10:45.732
I'm cool.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.298
I'm counting six guns
aimed at us.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.865
What's the move?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.737
Aren't you guys trained
to negotiate or something?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.521
Good point.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.828

more often.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.283
Didn't I say stay cool?!

11:15.283 --> 11:16.763
Are we alive right now?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.852
Who the hell were those guys,
and what do they want with you?

11:18.852 --> 11:19.983
I-I don't know.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.507
We need to find
a safe place

11:22.507 --> 11:23.770
to lie low
and figure out what's what.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.303
<i>The op is compromised.</i>

11:35.303 --> 11:38.132
Local PD set us up
for an ambush to grab Barlowe.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.786
We evaded and are looking
for a place to hide.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.613
Okay, listen to me.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.919
Remember,
this is a small island.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.399
There are eyes
and ears everywhere.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.356
So whatever you do,
you trust no one.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.793
Do you understand?

11:46.793 --> 11:48.838
<i>Nugenius has to be behind this.</i>

11:48.838 --> 11:51.319
Who else would be this invested
to take Barlowe right now?

11:51.319 --> 11:52.755
Let's assume they're tracking
your devices.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.104
Assume they're listening to us
right now.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.106
Once we hang up, you destroy
the phones immediately.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.413
What?
No-- No guns and no phones?

11:58.413 --> 12:00.545
This is getting
way past ridiculous.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.895
Get your hands
on a burner phone

12:01.895 --> 12:03.374
while I work on getting you
an exfiltration.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.028
Contact me
as soon as you can.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.029
Listen, I'm gonna
get you home, okay?

12:06.029 --> 12:07.857
Thanks, Matt.

12:07.857 --> 12:08.945
Give me your phone.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.556
I took some real good
beach selfies on this.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.775
Upload them
to the cloud first, okay?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.255
No problem.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.692
Not those clouds.

12:16.692 --> 12:17.867
Damn.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.221
Your wife's
Frillest account

12:24.221 --> 12:26.093
was used to sell
this handbag.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.836
That was me.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.576
I've been using Denise's account
to sell her stuff.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.230
Since her murder,
I've been trying to find a way

12:33.230 --> 12:34.623
to honor her memory,

12:34.623 --> 12:36.146
so I figured I could
donate the money

12:36.146 --> 12:36.973
to a cause
she cared about.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.627
So this was Denise's bag?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.848
Hmm.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.024
I don't understand.
Is there a break in the case?

12:44.024 --> 12:45.721
We think so.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.157
On the morning
of your wife's murder,

12:47.157 --> 12:49.420
two women robbed
an armed courier

12:49.420 --> 12:52.032
of $2 million in diamonds
right outside L.A.X.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.164
Where your wife worked.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.079
The stolen diamonds
were found in hidden pockets

12:56.079 --> 12:57.428
sewn into the lining.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.694
I don't--

13:02.694 --> 13:03.957
What are you saying?

13:03.957 --> 13:05.828
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, sir,

13:05.828 --> 13:09.876
but we believe your wife
was one of the robbers.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.486
That's insane.

13:12.879 --> 13:13.880
No, she was quiet.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.620
She liked board games.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.231
I mean,
she had an herb garden.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.711
I-- No, Denise couldn't have
done something like this.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.061
I would have known.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.845
Except according to
the police report,

13:22.845 --> 13:26.980
you were in San Diego
at the time.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.546
Yeah,
it was a business trip.

13:28.546 --> 13:32.072
Maybe that's why she planned
the heist for that time.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.074
To keep it from you. No.

13:34.074 --> 13:36.293
Denise wasn't
a diamond thief.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.340
That just wasn't her.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.820
Was it?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.345
Let's pull up anything
we can find on Denise--

13:44.345 --> 13:46.129
phone records,
socials, the works.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.349
Yeah, he may not feel like
his wife had anything to do

13:48.349 --> 13:50.307
with the heist, but... On it.

13:50.307 --> 13:53.049
So can I get
my bag back now?
Nope.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.312
Still evidence in
an open investigation.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.313
Simone and Carter
are in trouble.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.315
Sit-room. Now.

14:01.928 --> 14:05.801
It would've taken like two
seconds to upload those selfies.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.543
I mean, the wind was
blowing Felicia around

14:08.543 --> 14:10.458
in all sorts
of cute directions.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.765
And my skin was
poppin' in that sunset.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.464
I know a man that carries
a multi-tool in his pocket

14:16.464 --> 14:17.944
is not judging.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.554
Oh, this little guy here?
Be thankful.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.903
He might have
just saved our lives.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.731
Yeah, or prolonged
the inevitable.

14:22.731 --> 14:25.038
Face it--
we're gonna die here. Quiet.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.170
All right, I saw a street market
about a mile back.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.258
You stay with him.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.912
I'll go buy a burner
and call Garza.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.783
Well,
I don't mean to offend,

14:31.783 --> 14:34.264
but you could smell
the Fed all over you.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.266
I mean,
you should let me do it.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.834
Felicia and I will fit in
much better than...

14:38.834 --> 14:41.315
No, no, you stay.
I don't want to die with him.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.273
I-I-I want my last moments
to be fun.

14:43.273 --> 14:46.059
Nobody is gonna
die out here, okay?

14:46.059 --> 14:48.757
I can do this.
Trust me.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.454
Okay, but be careful.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.588
Come on, Felicia.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.591
Bye, Felicia.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.550
What? How did you get
a live satellite feed?

14:59.550 --> 15:00.943
Senator "Smith"
rerouted Polaris 7

15:00.943 --> 15:01.988
over the island for us.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.554
Who is Senator Smith?

15:03.554 --> 15:04.512
Don't worry about
that right now.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.790
Hey, how you doing?

15:21.790 --> 15:24.053
You never saw me.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.760
Yes. Hello?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.066
Oh, uh, yes.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.548
Hey, Simone.
Hey, h-h-- where are you?

15:40.548 --> 15:43.986
I'm in the Salt Mills Market
on Bay Street

15:43.986 --> 15:45.379
in a big-ass hat.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.598
And Denby's boys
are swarming this place,

15:47.598 --> 15:49.426
most likely looking
for my ass.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.819
Sit tight, Simone, okay?

15:50.819 --> 15:52.255
- Find her right now.
- Yep.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.781
- Matt, I need a minute.
- Not right now, Allen.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.218
One of my star witnesses
checked himself

15:58.218 --> 16:00.133
into a mental health facility.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.396
Another recanted
her testimony this morning.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.833
Some mercenaries
just tried to kill Barlowe.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.139
He's trapped on the island
with Simone and Carter.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.141
He's the last witness
we've got.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.707
Okay, looks like
Nugenius is trying to do

16:09.707 --> 16:11.448
whatever it takes
to kill your case.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.929
- Where-- Where are they?
- Simone is at a street market.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.496
We're trying to get
her out right now.
Here's what you can do.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.237
Contact
the State Department

16:17.237 --> 16:19.239
in case we need
- a diplomatic solution.
- I'm on it.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.197
<i>Hey. What y'all getting?</i>

16:21.197 --> 16:23.025
It's nice. Real nice.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.461
I like your hair, babe.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.072
Hey, how you doing?
How you doing?

16:26.072 --> 16:28.117
How's everybody?
All right.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.119
Found her.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.295
Simone, there are two entrances
to the market.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.429
<i>The south entrance is blocked
by a police cruiser.</i>

16:35.429 --> 16:37.170
Head north then turn right
at the T, toward the wharf.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.910
<i>Hurry. The cops are closing in
on that area.</i>

16:38.910 --> 16:40.086
Oh.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.652
No.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.221
Denby's here.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.659
Y'all, I'm trapped.

16:52.228 --> 16:55.057
Any ideas? I'm not gonna be able
to avoid them much longer.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.537
Okay, we need
a new way out for her.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.234
Some sort of distraction. Something.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.540
I'm scrolling ClipTalk,
and it looks like there's

16:59.540 --> 17:01.281
a flying dress shoot
coming Simone's way.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.543
What? What is
a flying dress shoot?

17:02.543 --> 17:03.979
It's women who
photograph themselves

17:03.979 --> 17:05.198
with long trains
flipping in the wind.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.069
Yeah, of course
you'd know that.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.462
Okay, Simone,
listen to me.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.726
Do you see a woman up ahead
in a yellow dress?

17:11.726 --> 17:13.989
Yeah. I'm gonna ride that train
right outta here.

17:13.989 --> 17:17.340
Girl, I did one of these when
I was in Santorini one year.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.559
The trick is to
make the dress fly.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.213
I got you.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.171

17:41.190 --> 17:43.540

I'm sending
the coordinates now.

17:44.802 --> 17:45.586
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

17:50.373 --> 17:51.940
Hop in,
mother truckers.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.376
We got a flight to catch.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.725
How'd you get this?

17:54.725 --> 17:56.162
Felicia.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.250
Damn straight.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.990
Get in the back.
Lay down.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.166
And it's head to toe,
my dude.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.258
Oh.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.050
As requested, I went through
Denise Palmer's phone records.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.399
Anything stand out?

18:16.399 --> 18:17.400
One or two things.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.010
Like,
a week before the heist,

18:19.010 --> 18:21.012
Denise chatted with a guy
named Logan Anders,

18:21.012 --> 18:22.231
and they met for drinks.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.928
Huh. An affair?
I don't know.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.279
But he's an armed courier
for Emory Security.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.585
Was he the driver
during the heist?

18:28.585 --> 18:30.196
No. He was working
in Chatsworth that day.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.762
His alibi's tight.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.200
That doesn't mean he
couldn't help Denise plan it.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.984
Yeah, let's see
what we can find out.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.423
Oh, yeah,
I remember her.

18:40.423 --> 18:43.209
That chick
was smoking h--

18:43.209 --> 18:46.516
I mean... that woman
is intelligent.

18:46.516 --> 18:47.996
Hmm.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.650
But wait. You said
her name was Denise?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.304
No, she told me
her name was Thelma.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.001
What'd you guys,
uh, talk about?

18:53.001 --> 18:54.785
Well, Thelma was really
interested in my job.

18:54.785 --> 18:55.960
You know, asked me
all these questions

18:55.960 --> 18:57.658
about being
an armed courier.

18:57.658 --> 19:01.183
Like training, protocols--
she was way into me.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.272
- Sure.
- And then her friend shows up,

19:03.272 --> 19:04.447
and she was super hot, too.

19:04.447 --> 19:07.233
Uh, uh--
I mean, intelligent.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.625
Uh, what friend?

19:08.625 --> 19:10.279
Her name's Louise.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.197
Right.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.417
Let me get this straight.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.115
They introduced themselves
to you as Thelma and Louise,

19:20.115 --> 19:22.857
asked you questions about
your job as an armed courier,

19:22.857 --> 19:24.859
and you didn't catch on
that maybe

19:24.859 --> 19:26.774
they were gonna use
the information you gave them

19:26.774 --> 19:27.514
to commit a crime?

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
Whoa. Yeah.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.258
Now that you did
the math for me,

19:32.258 --> 19:33.433
I see
what you're saying.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.436
Well, shame on me
for not thinking

19:36.436 --> 19:37.872
that women could be
criminal masterminds.

19:37.872 --> 19:42.006
So [chuckles] why don't you go
ahead and describe the woman

19:42.006 --> 19:45.140
who introduced herself
as Louise?

19:45.140 --> 19:47.055
Like I said, intelligent.

19:47.055 --> 19:50.450
Oh, and she had
a super sexy li--

19:50.450 --> 19:55.237
I-I mean,
super artistic tattoo

19:55.237 --> 19:56.282
of a barbed wire
on her neck.

19:58.719 --> 20:01.243
This Louise woman has got to be
Denise's accomplice.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.506
And possibly
her murderer.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.116
I'm gonna have
Elena dig deeper

20:05.116 --> 20:06.422
into the people
in Denise's life,

20:06.422 --> 20:08.119
see if we can get a match
for that tattoo.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.396
Oh.
Sorry.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.614
Didn't mean to scare you.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.660
I couldn't help but overhear
in your conversation.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.054
Did you-- Did you say
you're a... Benneteau?

20:30.054 --> 20:31.317
As in
Benneteau Vineyards?

20:31.317 --> 20:33.493
If you're not here
about the case, go away.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.321
Uh, no,
it's just that that--

20:35.321 --> 20:37.410
that wine is amazing.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.369
I got a bottle of the
'96 Syrah from my agent

20:40.369 --> 20:42.371
for the 100th episode
of "Vampire Cop."

20:42.371 --> 20:44.286
This-- This little,
uh--

20:44.286 --> 20:47.420
Who cares?
The Syrah is amazing.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.465
I'm so happy for you.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.427
I'm sorry your family's
being so hard on you.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.907
You should be sorry
you eavesdropped
on my conversations.

21:01.782 --> 21:04.959
I-I just-- I know exactly
what you're going through.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.788
Your family also owns a
multimillion-dollar corporation

21:07.788 --> 21:10.181
and is shouldering
its future on you?

21:10.181 --> 21:12.532
No, not exactly.

21:12.532 --> 21:16.971
But my dad forced me into acting
when I was a kid.

21:16.971 --> 21:20.017
It was-- It was his dream,
and when it didn't work out,

21:20.017 --> 21:22.237
he became obsessed
with having me succeed.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.761
So I just--
I remember the pressure.

21:24.761 --> 21:28.199
I'm glad you're pushing back.
It's a-- It's a good thing.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.636
I wish
I'd done it sooner.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.253
This just
doesn't make sense.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.950
Why is
Nugenius Industries

21:39.950 --> 21:41.474
trying to kill you
and not the others?

21:41.474 --> 21:43.563
- How should I know?
- What aren't you telling us?

21:43.563 --> 21:45.739
Seems like you're not hiding
from the government.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.784
You're hiding
from Nugenius.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.612
I-I don't want to
talk about it.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.485
Okay.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.922
Let's talk about
your daughter.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.750
Is she a daddy's girl?

21:56.750 --> 22:00.797
Abby?
Oh, yeah, sure is.

22:00.797 --> 22:03.278
What kind of things do
you guys do together?

22:03.278 --> 22:05.367
Ride bikes.
On my weekends.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.414
T-That-- That's what we do.
For hours.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.546
My ex even lets me keep my
bike equipment in the garage,

22:10.546 --> 22:12.853
and she hates me, so...

22:12.853 --> 22:15.421
that's-- that's how much
Abby loves riding with me.

22:15.421 --> 22:19.381
<i>Loved.</i>
Hm? Past tense.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.601
You've been gone
for three months, Bernie.

22:22.776 --> 22:26.519
Sounds to me like
you and Abby need each other.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.478
You have
to make things right

22:29.478 --> 22:31.262
and tell the truth.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.266
Talk to me.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.094
Talk to your father.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.748
I mean, weren't you
supposed to call him

22:38.748 --> 22:40.489
and tell him
how you've been lying?

22:40.489 --> 22:42.622
I forgot.

22:42.622 --> 22:43.753
Don't worry about my problems, okay?

22:43.753 --> 22:44.841
Fix your own.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.324
I'm gonna hit the head.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.631
Shoot.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.551
<i>Hey, Daddy, listen.</i>

22:58.551 --> 23:00.466
I-I need
to tell you something.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.425
What? That you've been hooking
up with Dina against my wishes?

23:03.425 --> 23:04.992
Too late.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.603
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

23:07.603 --> 23:10.693
Ruth and I
really like each other.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.827
And it's gonna be
all types of awkward between us

23:13.827 --> 23:15.437
when you and Dina
break up.

23:15.437 --> 23:18.135
<i>When</i> we break up?
Thanks a lot.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.486
I-- Wait.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.661
Why are you whispering?

23:21.661 --> 23:23.140
<i>Cutty, where'd you go?</i>

23:23.140 --> 23:24.664
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

23:24.664 --> 23:26.666
<i>Simone!</i>

23:26.666 --> 23:27.623
<i>Hi!</i>

23:27.623 --> 23:29.669
Hey, Ms. Ruth.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.106
Dina adores
everything about you.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.499
You know, we really should
get together,

23:33.499 --> 23:34.674
get to know
each other better.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.110
You should all have
a double date.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.721
Oh, well, hello.
Uh, great idea.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.462
Dinner tonight?

23:40.462 --> 23:43.813
<i>Ms. Ruth, I have had
a really long day.</i>

23:43.813 --> 23:45.946
Oh, no, no, no, honey,
don't worry. I will
arrange everything.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.121
I'm calling Dina now.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.905
Bye.
I--

23:50.559 --> 23:53.432
No, Daddy.
Not that look.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.527
Dinner's gonna be
so much fun.

24:01.527 --> 24:05.705
When we get to 30,000 feet,
I'm throwing your ass out.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.716
Welcome home.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.369
You're looking good, Simone.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.416
Don't I always?
Of course.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.766
Nice shorts there, Carter.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.376
My undercover look
for the island.

24:25.376 --> 24:28.728
I-I had a suit, but it's still
in the rental, which is--

24:28.728 --> 24:30.643
Regardless, as promised--
Bernie Barlowe.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.732
Long time no see,
Mr. Barlowe.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.647
Glad you made it home
in one piece.

24:34.647 --> 24:37.127
Rest assured, you'll be safe
in protective custody

24:37.127 --> 24:39.434
- until the trial.
- No, don't-- don't bother.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.697
Like I told them,
I'm-- I'm not testifying.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.960
Understand that you will
do serious prison time

24:43.960 --> 24:45.658
if you refuse.

24:45.658 --> 24:48.095
Oh, I understood it
when I fled the country.

24:48.095 --> 24:50.445
So, come what may.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.186
Can I have
a few minutes with him?

24:52.186 --> 24:53.404
Of course.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.363
That way, sassy pants.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.020
Come on, Bernie.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.463
Back in my
guidance counselor days,

25:08.463 --> 25:13.033
I watched a lot of kids who took
their lies to their graves,

25:13.033 --> 25:15.775
all because they didn't want
to face the consequences.

25:15.775 --> 25:19.343
But not you.
It's like... you welcome them.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.476
I'm not following you.

25:21.476 --> 25:24.392
See? That's how you
lost your house.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.742
'Cause you don't have
a poker face.

25:26.742 --> 25:31.530
So why would you sacrifice more
time away from your daughter?

25:34.881 --> 25:38.798
Nugenius bought you off.
They paid you to disappear.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.582
Well, what do you have on them,
Bernie?

25:44.412 --> 25:47.720
Enough dirt to give my daughter
a cozy trust fund.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.939
When I was 14,

25:49.939 --> 25:52.463
I lost my father
to the prison system

25:52.463 --> 25:54.640
for a crime he didn't even commit.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.294
When he was exonerated
eight years later,

25:57.294 --> 25:59.949
the city cut him
a big fat check

25:59.949 --> 26:02.343
with a whole lot of zeros.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.957
None of it was enough to make up
for what we lost--

26:07.957 --> 26:09.872
being without him.

26:09.872 --> 26:13.615
Cooperate, Bernie, and
the DOJ will cut you a deal.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.835
But then I'd have to
give the money back.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.837
That's not gonna happen.

26:17.837 --> 26:20.317
Well, let me tell you
what <i>is</i> gonna happen.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.798
If you refuse to testify,

26:22.798 --> 26:25.845
I will tear your financial life apart.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.194
And sooner or later,

26:27.194 --> 26:30.023
I will find that money
and take it away.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.459
Believe that.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.896
And that's
if you can find it.

26:33.896 --> 26:36.899
Bit of advice

26:36.899 --> 26:40.642
don't bet against me,
sassy pants.

26:40.642 --> 26:41.904
You will lose.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.126
I, um--
I need time to think.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.303
You have till morning.

26:54.308 --> 26:58.704
♪ Ooh, ohh ♪ Ooh, ohh

27:00.444 --> 27:02.359
These two.

27:02.359 --> 27:03.665
You know,
I've been wondering

27:03.665 --> 27:06.363
if you named her
after Nina Simone.

27:06.363 --> 27:09.279
Actually, Simone
is my mom's middle name.

27:09.279 --> 27:13.501
- But she is my favorite alto.
- Me, too.

27:13.501 --> 27:17.505
Oh, Nina, she moved effortlessly
through many genres,

27:17.505 --> 27:21.944
and the beauty and heartache
of her tone-- ooh, special.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.381
- Ohh.
- My baby's got good taste.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.906
Look at us vibin'.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.734
See, you thought it was
gonna be weird, huh, Daddy?

27:28.734 --> 27:31.475
Yeah.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.912
- Go answer that door.
- We having
a good time.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.827
Cheers to us.
Cheers to us.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.698
- Hey, hey!
- Hey.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.744
- Got your message.
- Hey, man.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.398
- A romantic soiree, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

27:41.398 --> 27:44.793
Now I see why you needed these
Coltrane classics.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.534
I added a little Sonny Rollins
in there for you, too.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.362
Yeah, I wondered
where my Sonny went.

27:48.362 --> 27:51.278
Oh, <i>my</i> Sonny was at <i>my</i> house
where he lives.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.584
You borrowed him from me and now
I'm loaning him back to you.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.848
No, no, no. You're thinking
about Thelonious Monk.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.501
Oh, we're gonna have
this argument till we're old,

27:57.501 --> 28:00.113
- is that right?
- Oh, we're old now and
we're having it now.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.592
Come on, get out. Thanks.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.290
Hey, there, Simone.

28:03.290 --> 28:04.726
How you doing, girl?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.859
Hey, Mel.
Good to see you.

28:06.859 --> 28:07.990
Good to be seen.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.557
Okay, Mel.
Come on, man.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.994
Yeah, hold on.
I'm leav-- I'm leaving.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.779
You two pretty ladies
have a good evening,

28:13.779 --> 28:15.911
and make sure these
roughnecks treat you right.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.608
Oh.

28:17.608 --> 28:22.309
Mel, this is actually
my <i>girlfriend,</i> Dina.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.659
Oh... my bad.

28:24.659 --> 28:28.097
Man, your mind
must be blown, too.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.882
She might as well
just date a dude.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.232
Watch your damn mouth.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.756
That's not for you
to question or judge.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.845
Y-You ignorant--
Daddy.

28:36.845 --> 28:40.240
Now you just take your
simple-minded opinion
out of my house!

28:40.240 --> 28:41.763
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Okay, I'm out. I'm out.
- Right now! Out!

28:44.461 --> 28:45.811
I can't believe
that just happened.

28:45.811 --> 28:49.771
Yeah, some people
need to learn.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.381
No, I mean you.

28:51.381 --> 28:53.340
My ex-husband
had anger issues,

28:53.340 --> 28:55.385
and I don't ever want
to be around that energy again.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.172
I mean, if your rage
is that close to the surface...

29:01.870 --> 29:04.264
I'm not sure I know you
as well as I thought.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.222
<i>♪ I want you, I want you♪</i>

29:12.054 --> 29:15.014
- Hey, Elena.
- Hey. I found the lady
with the barbed wire tat.

29:15.014 --> 29:16.624
<i>She worked with
our victim at L.A.X.</i>

29:16.624 --> 29:17.843
<i>Her name's Aria Lansing.</i>

29:17.843 --> 29:19.409
Nice job.
We'll go pick her up.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.281
Oh, I already did. <i>
Excuse me?</i>

29:21.281 --> 29:22.499
<i>Well, I didn't
pick her up personally.</i>

29:22.499 --> 29:23.805
<i>I had LAPD do it.</i>

29:23.805 --> 29:25.851
- W-Where are you?
- Mid-Wilshire station.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.156
She's in holding.
Want me to question her?

29:27.156 --> 29:29.115
Uh, no, no, no.
We'll be right there.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.945
Wow, Elena
just pulled a Simone.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.207
Let's go.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.471
That's them.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.603
Hey.

29:39.603 --> 29:42.302
On a scale of one to tell
my boss/uncle and get me fired,

29:42.302 --> 29:43.477
how mad are you?

29:43.477 --> 29:45.044
Well,
you managed to do our jobs

29:45.044 --> 29:46.523
without breaking the law
or getting hurt,

29:46.523 --> 29:50.179
so I guess I'm more
threatened than angry?

29:50.179 --> 29:53.182
But I'm not covering for you
if Garza asks where you've been.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.097
Copy.
See you back at the office.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.190
Aria Lansing?

30:01.190 --> 30:03.976
I'm Special Agent Stensen.
This is Special Agent Acres.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.455
Why am I here?

30:05.455 --> 30:07.718
We want to talk to you
about Denise Palmer.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.677
You were, uh, friends?

30:09.677 --> 30:11.897
Yeah. At work.
It's not like we were besties.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.986
Oh, okay.

30:13.986 --> 30:17.511
What about your, uh--
your alter egos?

30:17.511 --> 30:20.514
Thelma and Louise, right?
Were they besties?

30:20.514 --> 30:22.081
We know about
the diamond heist.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.996
What are you
talking about?

30:23.996 --> 30:27.129
We know Denise had the diamonds
hidden when she was gunned down,

30:27.129 --> 30:28.522
and clearly you didn't
know where they were.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.132
I mean, I'd be upset
if my partner in crime

30:30.132 --> 30:31.786
didn't give me my cut.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.309
Okay, um...

30:33.309 --> 30:36.530
look, um,
I didn't kill her, okay?

30:36.530 --> 30:38.532
Denise came to me
with the idea.

30:38.532 --> 30:42.275
I thought she was crazy at
first, but she was determined,

30:42.275 --> 30:46.322
and I was
bored and broke.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.107
Okay, so what happened
after the heist?

30:48.107 --> 30:50.718
Uh, we met for dinner
at the Seabury Hotel.

30:50.718 --> 30:53.982
Just talked about what
we would each do with the money.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.115
Um, she had it
all worked out.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.986
She said she was gonna
wait a couple weeks for
the heat to die down

30:57.986 --> 30:59.901
and then unload the stones
in Belgium.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.294
You weren't gonna
go with her?

31:01.294 --> 31:02.382
Oh, no.
I'm scared of flying.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.383
And I trusted her.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.341
She was gonna
wire me my cut

31:05.341 --> 31:06.777
and then
go live out there.

31:06.777 --> 31:08.518
Wait.
She wasn't coming back?

31:08.518 --> 31:10.999
She said she couldn't wait
to buy a one-way ticket,

31:10.999 --> 31:12.087
never to return.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.784
Hmm.

31:13.784 --> 31:15.134
Why would she say that?

31:15.134 --> 31:17.136
One guess who she was
trying to get away from.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.053
Did you find out
something new?

31:21.053 --> 31:25.361
Mr. Palmer, you said,
and in your statement to LAPD,

31:25.361 --> 31:27.973
that you were in San Diego
when your wife was murdered.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.844
Right.
Was on business.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.803
Well, I got this from
the hotel's parking garage.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.805
Records show
you left at 5:17 p.m.

31:34.805 --> 31:37.156
and didn't return
until after 11:00.

31:37.156 --> 31:40.159
Plenty of time
- to drive to L.A. and back.
- How dare you.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.770
Since Denise isn't here
to speak for herself,

31:42.770 --> 31:44.163
I will say it for her.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.947
You're an abuser.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.124
Possessive, cruel.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.431
And on that night--
jealous.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.954
You're wrong.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.783
You know, there's one way
to identify people like you,

31:55.783 --> 31:57.741
and that's by the actions
of your partners.

31:57.741 --> 32:00.092
And for Denise to be
desperate enough

32:00.092 --> 32:03.008
to pull off
a crime like that...

32:03.008 --> 32:05.184
well, that tells me everything
I need to know about you.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.012
Lady,
you don't know anything.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.535
Sure, I do.

32:08.535 --> 32:10.667
Your phones were
on the same plan.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.974
You could have easily
tracked her on an app.

32:12.974 --> 32:16.195
You saw that she was at the
Seabury Hotel and you snapped.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.239
- That's not true.
- It is.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.893
You thought she was having
an affair,

32:18.893 --> 32:21.417
so you rushed back
to L.A. in a rage,

32:21.417 --> 32:22.853
and that's when
you got back

32:22.853 --> 32:24.464
just in time
to see her arrive home.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.683
And you shot her.
No. Mnh-mnh.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.424
Know why?

32:29.686 --> 32:31.036
You're weak.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.342
Bitch!

32:33.342 --> 32:34.822
I could say
the same about you.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.870
She was cheating on me,
but she was playing dumb.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.089
I didn't want to kill her,
I swear.

32:41.089 --> 32:42.177
I just wanted the truth.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.267
Denise wasn't
having an affair.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.661
She was planning
her escape...

32:47.661 --> 32:48.879
from you.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.413
Hey.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.589
Finally retired
the braids, huh?

33:02.589 --> 33:05.940
I went back to being me,
so I said, "Bye, Felicia."

33:05.940 --> 33:08.116
How's our boy Barlowe?

33:08.116 --> 33:10.640
Well, he is at Allen's office
right now, working out a deal.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.817
What you said last night
- got through to him.
- Say what now?

33:13.817 --> 33:15.471
And it turns out Barlowe
knew more than we thought.

33:15.471 --> 33:18.474
Nugenius has this new
billion-dollar proprietary resin

33:18.474 --> 33:21.173
for artificial bones,
just approved by the FDA.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.044
Barlowe has
a hard drive of proof

33:23.044 --> 33:24.872
that the lab results
were doctored.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.439
The resin breaks down
in the body.

33:26.439 --> 33:29.485
Nugenius knew this
and still went to market.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.226
Damn.

33:31.226 --> 33:32.967
No wonder Bernie
was scared.

33:32.967 --> 33:35.100
These people are evil.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.710
You two need to see this
right now.

33:38.364 --> 33:39.756
I had a friend at the DOJ

33:39.756 --> 33:42.150
open an investigation
on Inspector Denby.

33:42.150 --> 33:45.327
Good. 'Cause that scrub tried
to kill us on that island.

33:45.327 --> 33:46.850
They traced phone records
and found out who hired him

33:46.850 --> 33:48.069
to go after Barlowe.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.766
Someone from
Nugenius Industries?

33:49.766 --> 33:50.898
No.

33:54.771 --> 33:55.946
Allen.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.644
This can't be right.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.080
He and I worked this case
for years.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.083
Sorry, Carter.
He's on the take.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.476
This explains how they knew how
to get to all those witnesses,

34:03.476 --> 34:04.912
including Barlowe,

34:04.912 --> 34:06.305
and how Denby knew
to look for you

34:06.305 --> 34:08.089
- at that street market.
- Let's go get his ass.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.917
Well,
I called Allen's office,

34:09.917 --> 34:11.745
and he and Barlowe left
to retrieve a hard drive

34:11.745 --> 34:13.181
that's got all
this evidence on it.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.443
Anybody know where?

34:14.443 --> 34:16.184
Barlowe didn't want it
on any record.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.491
Part of his deal,
- I guess.
- Okay, let's think about this.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.101
The government has already
seized all of Barlowe's assets

34:20.101 --> 34:21.363
here and abroad.

34:21.363 --> 34:23.104
So it's not
anywhere official,

34:23.104 --> 34:25.324
like a bank or P.O. box,
or we'd already have it.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.282
His ex-wife's garage.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.110
He stores his
bike equipment there

34:29.110 --> 34:31.286
for when he goes to visit
with his daughter.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.896
I don't know, Simone.
That seems like a long shot.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.116
- It's the only shot we got.
- Go, guys.

34:53.874 --> 34:56.355
Everything you need to put
Nugenius Industries away

34:56.355 --> 34:57.617
is on there.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.184
My ticket to freedom.

35:00.794 --> 35:03.362
As an A-USA, I'm licensed
to carry a concealed weapon.

35:03.362 --> 35:05.190
Cool.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.409
As an I.T. guy,
I get free Internet.

35:07.409 --> 35:08.845
I'm gonna tell the police
that you flipped out,

35:08.845 --> 35:10.151
came after me.

35:10.151 --> 35:11.979
That's why
I had to do it.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.589
You'd, uh, do what?

35:18.420 --> 35:19.943
You did what you did
for your family.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.728
I'm doing the same.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.077
Allen, don't.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.298
What the hell
- are you doing, man?
- I'm broke, Carter.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.299
All I got is my
government pension,

35:27.299 --> 35:29.170
and Tina got half of that
in the divorce.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.563
So you sold out to the
people we were dedicated

35:30.563 --> 35:32.347
- to bring to justice?
- I don't want to die.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.566
I promised you, Bernie.
You won't.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.655
Allen, I get it.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.223
The money is tempting,
but murdering a man?

35:38.223 --> 35:39.528
That's not who you are.

35:39.528 --> 35:40.877
Let him go.

35:40.877 --> 35:43.271
Screw it.
I'm not going to prison.

35:46.405 --> 35:47.406
Don't.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.802
That worked
just like in the movies.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.413
Ahh, that hurts.

35:56.066 --> 35:58.808
Was that the drive?

35:58.808 --> 36:01.028
Good thing it's not the only one
I have.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.552
- Where's the other one?
- I'll tell you.

36:03.552 --> 36:07.295
But, uh, first, I'm gonna need
to negotiate a better deal.
