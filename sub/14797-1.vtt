01:47.816 --> 01:49.614
Shit! Did you see that?

01:54.781 --> 01:59.833
- Don't touch him.
- Call an ambulance. An ambulance!

01:59.995 --> 02:03.044
- What was it?
- They're on their way.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.881
Don't touch him.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.267
Oh, my God.
What happened to him?

02:41.453 --> 02:46.334
'Look, we appreciate the sentiment
but, frankly, our client is not dead.'

02:48.210 --> 02:51.555
Yes, clinically speaking, but still...

02:52.464 --> 02:53.761
Mark...

02:56.259 --> 02:59.763
No, no, my dear Charlie,
we'd rather not litigate either.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.607
I'm so fucking bored of beating you.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.276
There's the court of public opinion.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.108
If your clients want to play games,

03:07.270 --> 03:10.023
I'll reach out to "The Sun",
"The Star" and "The Mirror".

03:13.694 --> 03:15.367
Well, you know our terms.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.458
No, he won't go on talk shows.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.334
No book tour. No media.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.212
Come on, Charlie, my client's a vegetable.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.924
Sorry, Charlie.
Could I ring you back in five minutes?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.726
- All right?
- Yeah.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.070
- So what's his story?
- He got hit by something big.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.910
- He's awake, but not answering.
- Sounds like my wife.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.587
Ready? One, two, three, go.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.569
'About the accident
I can say very little.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.355
'Something fell down from the sky.

05:56.398 --> 06:01.746
'Technology, parts, bits
squashing me on to the pavement

06:01.903 --> 06:05.077
'and then nothing, a blank.

06:05.240 --> 06:11.293
'The hospital, the coma,
vague images of corridors and lifts

06:11.454 --> 06:15.084
'wires and catheters,
trip feeds and tubes.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.553
'Ghostly figures drifting in and out,

06:18.712 --> 06:22.558
'fighting to keep my damaged brain
from swelling like a balloon.

06:22.716 --> 06:27.062
'Surgery. Drugs. Pain, of course. Lots.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.938
'But also tedium.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.350
'Endless stretches of time.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.861
'Bedridden, then upright, then rehab.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.990
'Learning to grasp
at colourful things like a baby.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.650
'Over and over.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.660
'Spearing food with a fork.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.743
'Swallowing. Tying shoe laces, buttons.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.870
'Walking.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.287
'A never-ending dream
of repetitive jerky movements.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.924
'Until one day they let me out
and it stopped.'

08:34.806 --> 08:36.479
Ow!

08:43.481 --> 08:46.155
'Your call cannot be taken at the moment,

08:46.317 --> 08:48.991
'so please leave your message
after the tone.'

09:02.667 --> 09:03.964
Hello?

09:04.127 --> 09:07.631
'Finally! You're very hard
to reach. How are you feeling?'

09:07.797 --> 09:09.140
Who is this?

09:09.299 --> 09:13.224
'Mark Daubenay, your lawyer.
Your friend, Greg, works for me.'

09:13.970 --> 09:16.814
We met at the hospital. How are you doing?

09:16.973 --> 09:20.068
'Look, I've got wonderful news.
They've capitulated.'

09:20.226 --> 09:22.354
Can... can I please call you back?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.989
Listen, they've approached us with a deal

09:25.148 --> 09:27.992
whose terms are unprecedented,
financially speaking.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.370
'First, their conditions.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.451
'You must drop all legal action

09:32.614 --> 09:37.370
'and you can't discuss the accident
in public or in any recordable format.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.539
'Essentially, you've got to forget
it ever happened,

09:40.705 --> 09:42.423
'legally speaking.'

09:42.582 --> 09:45.131
There's nothing to forget.
I don't remember any of it.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.297
Even better!
You want to know how much you get?

09:49.214 --> 09:51.592
£8.5 million.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.931
'8.5 million.'

09:57.347 --> 09:59.896
- Why the half?
- Sorry?

10:00.058 --> 10:03.312
Why not just eight or nine?

10:03.478 --> 10:05.606
In actual fact, the total payment

10:05.772 --> 10:08.867
will come out to quite
a bit more than that over time.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.652
Look, why don't you drop by and...?

10:13.822 --> 10:15.119
Hello?

11:16.634 --> 11:19.513
Nah, mate.
Listen, I'm at the phone box, innit?

11:21.264 --> 11:23.733
- Yo! Hurry up, snowflake.
- Sorry.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.610
Yo, come on, man. Time is money, bruv.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.111
One minute.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.443
'How may I direct your call?'

11:29.606 --> 11:34.328
- Mark Daubenay. I was just cut off.
- 'Could you hold the line, please?'

12:03.932 --> 12:07.152
'Hello? What happened there?
I called you back, but...'

12:07.310 --> 12:09.438
My phone died.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.901
Open up.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.613
'Hello? Are you still there?'

12:15.568 --> 12:17.536
- Open the door.
- 'Hello?'

12:17.695 --> 12:19.368
Put the phone down and come on out.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.123
- 'Still there?'
- I've got to go.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.000
- Hey, yo!
- Open the door!

12:23.159 --> 12:25.036
What the fuck are you doing?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.465
Filming, yeah?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.341
Fuck you!

12:32.627 --> 12:34.049
Back off, dickheads.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.931
Let's leave it.
Forget it. We'll do it later.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.640
Yeah, put the fucking gun down
before I put you on YouTube, bumbaclot!

12:40.802 --> 12:42.179
Yeah, I'll see you later.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.856
Fuck you!

12:53.690 --> 12:55.317
You done yet, chi-chi man?

13:03.157 --> 13:04.454
Like that.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.876
- Christopher.
- What?

13:13.501 --> 13:15.629
Hey, how do you know my name, bruv?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.638
Yo, only my mum calls me that shit, bruv.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.976
Do you know what? Come out, come out.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.600
Come out, bruv.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.846
The door is open.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.859
And your phone doesn't work.

15:01.025 --> 15:04.996
My lawyer called and...
I-l tore out the telephone.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.383
So, are you in trouble?

15:27.135 --> 15:28.432
Why do you ask?

15:28.594 --> 15:32.189
For a start, your lawyer. Didn't know
you had one. ls everything all right?

15:33.141 --> 15:38.648
Well, that's compensation for my accident.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.113
Yeah, but so there's no legal action?
The police aren't involved?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.118
No, no, that all has to stop.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.531
It's, it's part of the settlement.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.450
Yeah, but before the accident,
the suitcase?

15:50.616 --> 15:56.123
I don't remember any of it. I was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.841
That's all I know.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.425
I'm not even allowed to talk about it.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.849
So they're... they're giving you money?

16:07.758 --> 16:09.556
- Yeah.
- Well, how much?

16:10.386 --> 16:13.390
Tsst... Not that much.

16:13.556 --> 16:19.063
Several... After fees and taxes,
a few hundred thousand.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.525
Great.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.408
Enough for a cleaning lady.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.537
Enough for several, yes.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.540
Come on, caveman.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.418
Let me give you a haircut.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.723
'What's wrong?

17:35.179 --> 17:37.898
I keep thinking
you don't even remember me.'

17:40.726 --> 17:44.572
I have big gaps, but some things
are starting to come back.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.949
Like what?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.863
I remember seeing you
right before my accident.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.866
Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.960
I don't know. Somewhere outside.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.629
Well, what else?

18:03.416 --> 18:06.090
- I remember your smell.
- Thank you. Chanel.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.088
And I remember kissing you.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.767
Here.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.595
No.

18:17.221 --> 18:20.065
Someone who looked a lot like...

18:29.150 --> 18:33.621
So, we've had a great resolution
to the case, don't you think?

18:33.779 --> 18:37.374
No stressful litigation.
No long appeals process.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.130
Hm.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.710
You're looking well.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.716
Have a seat.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.587
Right, by signing this document,

18:49.754 --> 18:52.428
you're agreeing
not to discuss the accident in public

18:52.590 --> 18:55.264
or in any recordable format.

18:55.426 --> 18:58.726
- Essentially...
- I have to forget it ever happened.

18:58.888 --> 19:02.563
Even though I can barely walk.
Or eat. Or sleep.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.153
Legally speaking.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.399
We don't have to accept their offer.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.489
We can drag them to court
and expose them in public.

19:13.152 --> 19:17.908
You'll get some press clippings that you
can frame, maybe a few fans on Facebook,

19:18.074 --> 19:20.953
but once this blow's over,
no one will give a shit about you.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.839
And make no mistake,
no judge will ever award this amount.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.999
Not even close. Never in this country.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.712
It's your choice.
Be a little famous for 15 minutes.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.973
Or put it behind you and start a new life

19:34.131 --> 19:37.260
on your terms,
with incredible resources.

19:52.316 --> 19:57.914
I've set up an account in your name
at Sleets Bank in Holborn.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.540
- Do you know it?
- No.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.794
Well, they specialize
in high net-worth clients.

20:02.952 --> 20:06.206
It's been a family business
for eight generations.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.581
Hey, man! Nice moves!

21:45.304 --> 21:47.648
It's all right. Take it, take it.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.904
This is my spot, you cunt!

22:43.070 --> 22:44.993
I told you not to come back here anymore!

22:46.282 --> 22:49.832
When? When did you see me?

22:51.996 --> 22:54.749
Hey, I don't remember.
When did you see me?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.757
Follow the money.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.068
Happy Halloween!

24:03.150 --> 24:05.994
Nice haircut. I love the costume.

24:07.655 --> 24:08.952
Dick Cheney.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.458
Remember him?

24:17.665 --> 24:21.511
Whoa, whoa. You all right?
I heard you finally signed the documents.

24:22.211 --> 24:25.932
Thank you, Greg. For everything.

24:26.090 --> 24:29.185
It's a lot of money, though,
so I want you to be careful with it.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.266
- Don't.
- Sorry.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.901
Is someone staying with you?

24:39.061 --> 24:42.235
- No.
- I saw someone. Who is she?

24:42.398 --> 24:46.278
No, she was just visiting.
Erm, she's in Oxford now.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.242
Does she have a name? Who is she?

24:51.949 --> 24:53.542
- Whoa, whoa.
- Stop it, please.

24:53.701 --> 24:58.127
Wait, wait.
Fucking hell, you don't remember, do you?

24:59.081 --> 25:01.504
- Stop it.
- Fuck!

25:03.002 --> 25:06.677
Her name's Catherine, you gimp!
Catherine Sullivan.

25:07.381 --> 25:10.100
Name doesn't ring a bell? No?

25:10.968 --> 25:15.269
She's American. She works in a posh bank.
We all used to study together.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.104
- Stop it.
- Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.939
- Let go.
- Listen. Wait.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.858
She's a real cunt, OK?

25:22.938 --> 25:27.159
You might not remember,
but, trust me... you hate her guts.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.157
And you know something else?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.118
OK, you're going to love this.

25:33.741 --> 25:37.041
She's my wife. That's something, innit?

25:40.998 --> 25:44.423
But we haven't spoken in ages,
so... feel free to shag her.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.673
But it's a bit weird her suddenly
turning up after all this time.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.682
Where's she been this past year?

25:51.925 --> 25:53.518
I don't think she's in Oxford.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.021
She's a fucking liar, mate.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.309
- Why don't we call her?
- Leave me alone!

26:03.604 --> 26:05.777
Hey! There's a queue here!

26:10.360 --> 26:12.783
Hey, man... Hey man, what are you doing?

26:42.976 --> 26:45.149
Open the door.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.531
What the fuck are you doing in there?

29:32.354 --> 29:34.231
What?

29:57.921 --> 30:00.515
'Hello? Hello?

30:01.174 --> 30:03.472
'Come on now!'

30:06.680 --> 30:08.523
Come on! Hurry up!

30:16.857 --> 30:19.155
For fuck's sake!

30:19.818 --> 30:23.448
For fuck's sake!
Why are you always being like this?

30:24.865 --> 30:27.368
You were nearly an hour in there. What...?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.663
Just take it easy.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.083
- Hey! Watch it, you twat!
- Oi, dickhead.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.761
Hey, look! Dick Cheney!

31:16.541 --> 31:19.465
'Hello, your call
cannot be taken at the moment,

31:19.628 --> 31:22.757
'so please leave your message
after the tone.'

31:24.716 --> 31:26.684
'Hey, man. It's Greg.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.847
'Are you all right?

31:30.013 --> 31:34.234
'What happened last night?
Have you become, like, rich and eccentric?

31:34.393 --> 31:39.570
'Anyway, it's... it's Sunday afternoon
and I'm a bit worried about you.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.904
'Give us a call, all right?
OK, ciao, amigo.'

32:17.269 --> 32:19.613
Hey. I thought you'd be sleeping.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.241
What happened to your head?

32:24.651 --> 32:26.745
I banged into something.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.494
What is this?

32:34.369 --> 32:35.666
How was Oxford?

32:35.829 --> 32:38.002
Oh, you know, pretty touristy.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.508
But you went?

32:40.709 --> 32:42.427
Sure I did.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.346
I even took stupid pictures.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.257
You want to see?

32:49.259 --> 32:50.727
Look.

32:51.761 --> 32:55.937
This is me on the quadrangle.

32:57.058 --> 33:00.562
Uh, this is me at Christchurch Cathedral.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.157
Me at Blackwell's bookshop.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.911
And, voila, me again
at the Headington Shark.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.241
- Who took the pictures?
- Oh, just someone I know.

33:13.450 --> 33:15.168
Was it Greg?

33:15.327 --> 33:20.049
No. No, just someone from the conference.
Look, there he is.

33:22.751 --> 33:26.096
He's just an old friend.
Not really my type, you know.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.679
University guy. A bit too predictable.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.852
He asked you to marry him.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.103
Yes!

33:38.266 --> 33:41.019
How did you know?
God, can you imagine?

33:41.186 --> 33:44.736
We'd live in some country cottage
and eat shepherd's pie every Sunday.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.489
I'd paint landscapes
and develop a drinking habit

33:48.652 --> 33:51.952
and act all American and gauche
in front of his friends.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.410
You know?

33:53.573 --> 33:58.079
Stuck together, but barely communicating,
like characters in a...

33:58.745 --> 34:00.372
- Uh...
- A Harold Pinter play.

34:00.539 --> 34:04.043
Yes! Oh, shit! Let me clean that up.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.969
We've had this conversation before.
Do you remember?

34:12.175 --> 34:13.927
No, I don't.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.266
Please, you're hurting me.

34:16.429 --> 34:19.353
Come on. Do you remember?

34:21.101 --> 34:24.605
No... I don't.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.395
Don't stop.

35:03.977 --> 35:08.323
Wait. I know who's calling.
We've been through this already.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.903
Uh, no, it's not what you...

35:13.069 --> 35:14.571
Give...

35:21.911 --> 35:23.879
Get the fuck out of here.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.805
Yes, I-|-I'm looking to buy a property.

36:58.967 --> 37:03.518
No, t-t-the borough's not important,
but the building is very particular.

37:03.680 --> 37:08.277
Old on the outside,
but 1980s on the inside,

37:08.435 --> 37:11.063
and there's a sculpture of a woman...

37:13.064 --> 37:14.862
Sorry? No.

37:15.024 --> 37:19.154
It's not historical features I'm after,
it's very particular ones.

37:19.320 --> 37:23.370
A red-brick facade. Cats on the roof
of the neighbouring building.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.285
Of course you're not a pet shop,

37:25.452 --> 37:28.797
but I-I-I'm just...
I'm trying to explain what I've seen.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.295
Hello?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.628
I don't remember.'

37:34.794 --> 37:39.721
Look, what's important is that
I can describe it and I have to find it.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.011
Find it or make it.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.772
Well, if, if you can't help me,
then who can?

37:47.932 --> 37:49.479
Nazrul what?

37:51.561 --> 37:53.029
Can you spell that?

37:58.443 --> 38:01.492
Tell me, what sort of building
did you have in mind?

38:01.654 --> 38:05.784
It's old.
It's a five-storey tenement house.

38:05.950 --> 38:10.296
Red brick and white windows.
The tops of the windows have curves.

38:11.372 --> 38:14.922
Inside it's like it's stuck in the '80s.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.212
There's a bust...
hanging over the entrance,

38:17.378 --> 38:21.258
and underneath there's a carving
that says, it <i>says</i> something like,

38:21.424 --> 38:26.100
"Madison Gardens“ or "Marilyn Mansion".

38:26.930 --> 38:31.811
I have drawings at home, but... most
of the details haven't come to me yet.

38:34.229 --> 38:39.281
Good. But tell me about the people
you're proposing to fill the building with.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.486
Well, there's an old lady.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.580
And she wears a head wrap.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.618
- What, like a hijab?
- No, like a handkerchief.

38:47.784 --> 38:51.129
Wisps of white hair, socks, slippers,

38:51.287 --> 38:56.760
but she cooks liver constantly.

38:56.918 --> 38:59.922
So, the smell of fried liver has to...

39:03.132 --> 39:05.100
waft up to my flat.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.392
And she's also required
to deposit her rubbish

39:08.555 --> 39:11.058
outside her flat whenever I leave mine.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.977
And we exchange words.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.777
I haven't worked them out yet.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.530
Understood. Who's next?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.070
Are you Muslim?

39:24.904 --> 39:26.497
No. Are you?

39:27.282 --> 39:30.206
No, I just... Erm... the hijab.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.463
I'm not particularly fond of religion.

39:35.164 --> 39:36.586
Neither am I.

39:38.459 --> 39:42.180
Good. Who else lives in this house?

39:42.338 --> 39:44.761
There's a pianist two floors below me.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.804
And in the afternoons he teaches children,
but the rest of the time he composes.

39:48.970 --> 39:52.941
And the sound of the piano
has to waft up to my flat,

39:53.099 --> 39:55.022
just like the smell of fried liver.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.231
There's also a boy I keep seeing.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.616
When everything's right, he'll appear.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.279
But I... I can't describe him now.

40:09.157 --> 40:13.037
It seems like my colleagues have found
a match for your building already.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.165
The interior may need gutting.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.960
- But essentially...
- This is it.

40:22.003 --> 40:23.846
Madlyn Mansions.

40:24.005 --> 40:27.100
How did...? Where is this?
Where...? What's the address?

40:28.843 --> 40:31.972
Is this a childhood home or...?

40:32.138 --> 40:34.732
- What is it?
- How much do you charge?

40:37.268 --> 40:41.990
- Well, there are several options.
- I want you full-time, all the time.

40:42.148 --> 40:44.071
I'm not cheap.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.741
I'll pay you in advance.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.941
Waste of time. The little twat's not in.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.826
- But maybe the suitcase is here.
- It's not.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.989
I spent the whole of yesterday
looking for the bloody thing.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.412
Stop fucking doing that.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.877
The last of the holdouts have left.

41:48.256 --> 41:51.931
- Have the window people arrived?
- They're upstairs measuring.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.437
- I thought the windows were done.
- They were.

41:54.595 --> 41:58.020
The ones on the third floor have had
to come out to squeeze in the piano.

41:58.182 --> 42:02.528
- We're two weeks behind schedule.
- Sir, you are a bit of a perfectionist.

42:02.687 --> 42:05.531
If it wasn't for Nazrul,
it'd be two years behind schedule.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.365
Is there anything else
you're not happy with?

42:10.361 --> 42:14.457
- The cracks on the walls look contrived.
- What's that supposed to mean?

42:14.615 --> 42:17.664
- The opposite of natural.
- I know what the word means, Naz!

42:17.827 --> 42:20.455
But how can the bloody cracks
not looked contrived?

42:20.621 --> 42:23.795
- For fuck's sake, we made them!
- I'd like to get the windows blocked.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.007
- Yeah, I know. We'll use paper for that.
- And we need cameras.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.639
And I want to get a security guard.

42:29.797 --> 42:34.098
I'll make some calls, but first there's
something I'd like to show you upstairs.

42:42.226 --> 42:47.107
That guy by the phone box,
I didn't realise he was so close.

42:47.273 --> 42:50.026
- They loiter there every day. A problem?
- No.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.703
No. It's good that they're there.

42:53.362 --> 42:55.160
They look out for me.

43:03.664 --> 43:07.339
- Why are the cats tied?
- They sometimes fight and fall.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.842
We've lost five just this week.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.598
Well, that's not how it should be.
Have them untied.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.442
Hi, Sam. Could you untie the cats?

43:24.977 --> 43:26.854
These are the last cats we have.

43:28.981 --> 43:32.485
- And?
- Well, if they fall, we'll be catless.

43:32.652 --> 43:35.952
What? Then we'll get more cats.
Why are we even talking about this?

43:36.656 --> 43:39.660
Sam... untie the cats.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.923
Our cat handler's just quit.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.461
- Fuck him.
- Fuck her. Sam is a woman.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.301
Are we having a problem, Naz?

43:54.590 --> 43:56.638
Er, no.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.720
Get a new handler.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.893
And get rid of those cats.

44:02.515 --> 44:04.813
We'll start from scratch
with unspoilt ones.

44:04.976 --> 44:09.777
And if they fight, have them sedated
or castrated or whatever.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.986
- You have to make mistakes.
- Sorry?

44:48.144 --> 44:50.112
Go over the parts you got wrong

44:50.271 --> 44:54.151
and play it again and again slowly
until you get it right.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.116
In the day you teach children,
in the night you compose.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.451
And when we're on,
you never leave the flat.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.700
What should I compose?

45:03.576 --> 45:06.830
- Chopin.
- Chopin's already composed.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.423
Then compose him again.

45:09.582 --> 45:13.587
Start with the first thing he wrote
and continue through everything else

45:13.753 --> 45:17.053
and when you're done just start over.

45:17.215 --> 45:20.014
I can do that, sure.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.411
Do you know what to do?

45:38.569 --> 45:41.288
Yes, sir.
I-l just stand here without moving.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.996
There's a small cupboard with a broom.

45:44.158 --> 45:47.207
I don't want you to use it ever,
but you have to think about it.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.089
Visualize, don't actualize.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.342
Very good, sir.

45:55.878 --> 46:00.133
Some of you have
specific tasks to perform.

46:00.299 --> 46:02.802
Others just have to be somewhere
without moving.

46:03.761 --> 46:07.811
'You may have noticed that in the building
there are certain areas left blank.

46:07.974 --> 46:10.318
'That's like the masks
some of you are wearing.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.030
<i>'You're not less important,
you're just less specific.'</i>

46:39.630 --> 46:41.303
Spare some change, bro?

46:44.218 --> 46:47.722
Look, what's going on? You haven't
called me back in, like, six weeks.

46:47.888 --> 46:49.310
I've been busy.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.396
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

46:51.559 --> 46:53.061
Moving to a new place.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.525
Look, we need to talk.

46:55.688 --> 46:58.908
It's important.
Come on, let's go for a walk.

46:59.066 --> 47:02.070
- I'm tired, Greg.
- Gentrification's tough work.

47:06.532 --> 47:09.376
What's happened to you?

47:10.411 --> 47:12.914
Why are you being like this?
It's me. I love you.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.249
Leave me alone.

47:16.292 --> 47:17.669
OK.

47:20.046 --> 47:23.676
But who visited you every day
when you were in that hospital?

47:23.841 --> 47:26.720
Who fought to have you transferred
from that vegetable ward?

47:26.886 --> 47:30.857
And who chased down the bastards who
did this to you and got you your money?

47:31.015 --> 47:34.895
Whatever Catherine's been telling you,
it's all lies.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.482
- Goodbye, Greg.
- Well, fuck you too!

47:40.358 --> 47:43.077
Well, take care. Have a nice day.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.406
Prick.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.884
Same time tomorrow?

48:22.525 --> 48:24.527
That's an arrival on TG.

48:30.199 --> 48:32.543
'Everything's in place. Are you ready?'

48:34.078 --> 48:35.455
Yes.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.471
You can turn them all on now.

49:30.217 --> 49:33.972
Three, two, one, go.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.533
Very good.

50:20.893 --> 50:22.190
Stop.

50:28.692 --> 50:33.323
- It should be more quiet.
- OK. Everyone, a touch quieter.

50:33.489 --> 50:34.957
Resume.

51:26.667 --> 51:28.669
Stop.

51:40.973 --> 51:44.273
Very good. Now the liver lady.

52:02.411 --> 52:03.708
Freeze.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.256
Reverse.

52:17.217 --> 52:18.935
Stop.

52:22.097 --> 52:24.191
OK, now forward.

52:29.521 --> 52:32.195
That's it. Freeze.

52:39.073 --> 52:40.575
Yes.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.991
- OK, stop everything, Naz.
- 'OK.'

53:18.320 --> 53:21.995
So sorry, sir.
I'm not a 20-year-old ballerina.

53:51.895 --> 53:53.238
Stop the car.

54:06.869 --> 54:09.748
- Christopher!
- One second, yeah?

54:15.377 --> 54:16.754
Do you remember me?

54:17.504 --> 54:19.723
Nah, sorry. Should I?

54:20.507 --> 54:24.478
The phone box. I had a beard.

54:25.053 --> 54:26.851
Oh, shit!

54:27.014 --> 54:29.392
What happened?
I thought you was homeless.

54:29.558 --> 54:32.528
- You still have that film on your phone?
- Nah.

54:32.686 --> 54:36.441
When he knocked the phone out of my hand,
it broke, so I had to go get a new phone.

54:38.567 --> 54:42.367
What if I asked you to be
at that phone box every day?

54:43.197 --> 54:45.325
And every night?

54:47.993 --> 54:49.495
Whoa.

54:50.621 --> 54:54.342
Listen, yeah, I'm not a hustler.
I don't want no trouble.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.127
It's nothing illegal.

54:56.293 --> 54:59.388
Just the more time you spend there,
the more money you make.

55:00.464 --> 55:04.014
- All right.
- But the phone will ring.

55:04.176 --> 55:09.728
Randomly. And if you're there
and you answer it, you'll get paid.

55:10.432 --> 55:12.560
But only if you answer it.

55:12.726 --> 55:15.024
All right. Cool.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.873
Try again next week?

55:48.470 --> 55:51.440
30. 5 ft 8".

55:51.598 --> 55:54.568
Medium-build, not fat.

55:54.726 --> 55:58.526
Erm, brown eyes. Dark skin.

55:59.231 --> 56:01.825
D-d-don't forget she has to be American.

56:01.984 --> 56:03.281
Yeah, bla...

56:03.443 --> 56:06.447
Whatever you call it.
Black, African-American.

56:06.613 --> 56:07.990
Right.

56:09.157 --> 56:11.376
I don't... I don't care how much it costs.

56:11.535 --> 56:14.288
Just don't send me
any more Moldovans, OK?

56:15.914 --> 56:17.632
OK.

56:29.136 --> 56:30.433
Christopher.

56:37.895 --> 56:40.068
Hi. You know what, call me later.

56:58.332 --> 57:00.005
Christopher.

57:04.588 --> 57:08.058
You take care of the camera.
Hurry up.

57:13.472 --> 57:17.272
- Christopher's dead.
- I know he was important to you.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.812
I can have someone stand in for him,
if you like.

57:21.772 --> 57:24.025
Do you have any contacts in the police?

57:24.775 --> 57:28.700
- I do. Why do you ask?
- I don't think they're telling the truth.

57:28.862 --> 57:31.490
I want their report.
I want to know what it says.

57:32.157 --> 57:33.534
I'll see what I can do.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.546
Thank you.

57:44.920 --> 57:46.297
Stand him down.

57:47.756 --> 57:49.758
But he's playing the victim.

57:50.509 --> 57:52.227
Send him home, Naz.

57:56.014 --> 57:57.766
- Do you two know what to do?
- Yes, sir.

57:57.933 --> 57:59.731
Your producer talked us through scene.

57:59.893 --> 58:03.318
You won't be shooting at the other guy,
you will be shooting at me.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.323
But you're the wrong colour, boss.

58:06.942 --> 58:10.162
I open the door, I pull out the gun
and then you zap me here.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.573
Do you know how to use this?

58:13.448 --> 58:15.917
- This thing ain't real, is it?
- Yeah, it is.

58:16.076 --> 58:18.124
I'm sorry. That wasn't part of the plan.

58:18.286 --> 58:20.038
Is the gun real too, brother Naz?

58:20.205 --> 58:23.379
No, of course it isn't, but I can't
allow them to use a real Taser.

58:24.167 --> 58:26.340
Then go home. I don't need you.

58:31.633 --> 58:35.012
'1:18 am
Christopher Williams enters the phone box

58:35.178 --> 58:38.148
'near the Southwell Road railway bridge.

58:38.306 --> 58:42.812
'A short time thereafter Williams leaves
the phone box and approaches his bicycle.

58:42.978 --> 58:44.980
'He's accosted by an unknown assailant.

58:45.147 --> 58:49.118
'Pulls out his silver semi-automatic
pistol, but is shot twice at close range.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.579
'No eye witnesses have been identified.

58:52.738 --> 58:57.960
'A nearby surveillance camera
was disabled by heavy rainfall. Go.'

59:17.345 --> 59:20.394
Whoa! OK, some space, please.
Someone get me a medic now.

59:20.557 --> 59:23.561
No. That was not how it was. It can't be.

59:24.603 --> 59:26.571
Let's do it again.

59:26.730 --> 59:29.574
I don't see why it's necessary
that you hurt yourself.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.084
How much time do we have?

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.299
OK.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:20.844
How was Oxford?

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:25.441
You know... very touristy.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.102
- But you went?
- Sure I did.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.487
I've got some pictures.
Do you want to see?

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:35.776
This is me on campus.
This is me in the cathedral.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:38.654
Here I am at the bookshop.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.824
And, ta-da, me again in front of the...

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.793
Shit!

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.172
Headington Shark.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:52.255
Oh, shite, it's "shark"! Sorry!

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:07.186
Who took the pictures?

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:13.864
- You know... someone I met.
- What is it, Greg?

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:19.244
No. Just some guy from the concert...
Sorry, conference.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.072
Don't get jealous.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.576
We didn't do anything naughty.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:30.206
Mind you, he didn't put
his little hand on my arse.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:33.922
Don't improvise!
Don't add anything! Don't be slutty!

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.428
Well, fuck off already!

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.965
Why don't I just suck you off
and be done with it, eh?

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:43.101
Two fucking weeks of this stupid shite!

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.891
"Was it Greg?" "Oh, the Paddington Shark."
Do you know what? Fuck it! I've had it!

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:51.026
Don't move. Don't move.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.858
Look at me.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:58.946
Whatever your agency are paying you,
I'll double it.

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:04.244
Please. I won't hurt you.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.369
Who took the pictures?

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:12.581
Who took them?

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.966
You know, someone I met.

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.884
- Was it Greg?
- No.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:27.805
Just someone from the conference.
An old friend. We didn't do anything.

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.441
He wasn't really my type, you know.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:35.062
A university man. A bit unpredictable.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.356
He asked me to marry him.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.160
No, that's my line.

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.991
Yes. How did you know?

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.210
Can you imagine?

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:52.962
We'd live in the country and we'd cook...

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:58.169
- We'd cook...
- Shepherd's pie.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:02.010
Shepherd's pie!
And I'd drink every Sunday and paint...

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.767
No, I mean, I'd develop a drinking habit
in front of his friends

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:09.395
and... I'd act American
in front of his friends.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.556
Together, no, stuck together,

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:14.852
but barely communicating
like some characters in a...

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.447
Like some characters in a...

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:25.362
A Harold Pinter play.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:29.032
The table.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:35.004
Sorry. Let me wipe that up.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:39.669
No, not now.
We've had this conversation before.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.132
Don't you remember?

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:45.720
- No, I don't.
- Come on.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:53.145
Don't... you... remember?

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.352
I don't know.

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.745
Erm... OK, we're going to...

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:13.585
I'm going to make some tea, then
we're going to do this going from the top.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:18.503
And can you please clean yourself up?
Because you... you smell horrible.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:35.042
OK, we both know you've got
the suitcase with the bank money.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.578
I don't know what
you're talking about, please.

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.963
I fucking saw you run out with it.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:43.751
Come on. Will you stop fucking around?
He's hurting my knee!

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:50.508
Where is the suitcase?
It's a black suitcase.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.471
On wheels.

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:56.479
Where is the suitcase?

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.266
Where is the suitcase?

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:03.857
Where did you fucking put it?

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:56.800
Just so you know, they've been
frozen for over an hour now,

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.890
so you'll have to let me know
when you want to release them.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.497
Look.

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:30.004
'...year-long investigation,
police believe they have found the suspect

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.794
'behind the Sleets robbery
and multiple killings.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.337
'Christopher Williams
was murdered last week

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.805
'in what police suspect was retribution.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:43.971
'Although police matched his silver pistol
and mask to the ones used in the robbery,

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:47.563
'Mrs Williams continues
to protest her son's innocence.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:49.227
'Katie Razzal in Brixton.'

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.443
I want you to get
plans of the bank for me.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:13.927
Oh, Sleets, eh? Wasn't that the bank
that got robbed last year?

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:15.086
Yeah.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:18.223
Crazy Yardie topped his mates
and ran off with the dosh.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.224
Did the coppers ever nab him?

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.977
- They killed him.
- Did they?

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.604
Let me get this straight.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.436
You want to give me shitload of money

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:30.317
to re-enact the robbery,
but you're not going to film it?

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:33.650
No. It's just research.
We'd like to know how it happened.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.781
Oh, well, the principle's the same.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:41.037
It's like I say in my book,
a bank robbery is like a theatre play.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:44.415
There's a script, there's a stage
and there are actors.

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:46.997
Shall we get started?

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:48.999
Lights!

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.016
Nice.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:11.856
So, you want to see a quick demonstration?

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:16.023
OK, boys, masks down, tools up.

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:19.317
Oh, no, no, no. Get a wriggle on.

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:23.409
You're robbing a bank,
not shopping for condoms! Back you go.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:27.333
Make no mistake, when you enter the bank,
you're setting off a chain,

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:29.711
which will lead
to someone calling the cops.

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:31.997
Your goal is to execute the script quickly

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.790
and to leave the stage healthy.

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:38.002
And wealthy. OK!

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.381
Fuck!

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.767
- I hope they're not real!
- They're blanks.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.223
Now, well done, but look.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:49.514
This is your Sistine Chapel.
Express yourself!

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.557
Write your name on the architecture!

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.694
Yes! Beautiful!

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:57.480
OK, Number 2,
get them to lay down on the carpet.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.570
OK, we need your full cooperation.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:03.202
You're Tony Montana! You're a psycho!
Put the fear of God into 'em!

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.080
- Get on the fucking floor!
- Lovely!

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:09.994
Now, Three and Four, they do the tellers.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.459
Come on! Chop, chop!
That's it! Put a gun to their face!

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.710
Any more robbing
and your set will disintegrate.

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:23.218
It needs to be more real.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.597
More like the real bank.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.520
You're hired.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:30.976
OK, boys.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:34.608
Back to the beginning.
Got a lot of work to do.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:41.801
Who's got the fucking keys?
Give me the keys now or I'll shoot you!

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:45.213
- OK, stop!
- 58 seconds.

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:46.926
Gather.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:54.105
What's the matter, Miss? Why won't you
let this gentleman have your key?

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:57.107
We don't have keys, sir.
The doors open with cards.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.984
Fucking right!

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:02.192
Remember, if you want something,
you grab it!

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:06.242
Always avoid a standoff.
Always keep moving. You got it?

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.697
- Yeah.
- Yes, boss.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.079
Right, from the top.

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:15.918
'Three, two, one, go.'

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.923
Get down! Get on the fucking floor!

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:22.959
Give your phones now!

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.672
Get your phones out!

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:28.055
You put the wrong number in
and I'll fucking shoot your dick off!

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:31.309
Put it in! Quickly!
Choose the right one, man!

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.845
- Quickly!
- Move, move, move!

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:38.107
Turn the lock! Quickly!
Any tricks, you're dead!

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:40.359
- Move! Come on!
- Come on! Move it! Come on!

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:43.112
- We used to do this too, you know.
- Do what?

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:47.275
Rehearse. We didn't just plan it on paper.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.068
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:52.455
We were so well drilled,
when the big day came, the whole thing,

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:54.206
it went like clockwork.

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:59.337
- Fucking quickly!
- Come on! Quicker than that!

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.372
Get the fucking door!
Hands on your head!

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:47.593
- Come on!
- Hands on your head!

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.800
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Oi!

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:54.842
Get off, you fat prick! Fuck!

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:58.809
You're acting like a bunch of dickheads!
Oi, shut up!

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.850
- Fuck you, dwarf!
- Can I have a set dresser?

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:05.771
Wait... Wait, don't touch it.
That was good.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:09.861
That was real. That was perfect.

01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:20.459
I want you to stumble on that kink
every time you run through.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.080
- Every time?
- Yeah.

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:29.253
But don't fall. Just... reach out
with your foot and stumble a bit.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.795
Then keep running.

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:35.891
Well, you heard the boss, ladies.
Back to your places.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:39.054
There's something wrong
with that kid's brain!

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.733
Put your fucking hands on your head!

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:46.944
No! No, no.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.481
- Are you trying to fuck me?
- Fuck you, you dwarf!

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:51.570
All right, listen to the boss, will you?

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:53.575
It's simple, OK?

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.453
Number 3, don't overdo it.
Number 4, don't stop.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:01.621
You, stumble, recover.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.252
Continue.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:05.708
And you just...

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.169
flank him.

01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:16.549
- Sorry, sir, did you say, "Flank him"?
- Yeah, yeah, flank me, bitch.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:20.390
Like a steak, chop-chop.
Come on. Back in your box.

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:24.057
- Come on, lads.
- When you're done, come on his face.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:26.646
I'm defriending you on Facebook
when I get home.

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:36.907
- That's it!
- Five minutes, five seconds.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:39.788
That's good enough for Hollywood,
but too slow for life.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.374
Well, how long should it take?

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:45.127
Well, it depends on location,
traffic conditions,

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:48.210
but generally speaking
anything over five minutes, mate,

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:50.374
and you're cattled.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.509
I'll go sort the boys out.

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:57.757
I want it more detailed. Everything.
Look at the walls. They're not right.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:01.848
That lift should be metallic and...
and the lights around the perimeter.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:06.232
You know, if, if the details aren't right,
then it doesn't work, especially outside.

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:09.860
The sounds are flat
and the sky, it's too clear.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:13.694
I want... clouds.

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.493
How long will it take?

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:26.624
'Thank you for calling Sleets.
How may I direct your call?'

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:28.913
Hi. This is Greg Simpson
from Olanger & Daubenay.

01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:30.672
I'm trying to reach Catherine Sullivan.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.710
'Oh, I'm afraid Ms Sullivan's
called in sick today.'

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.799
May I ask what this is in reference to?

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.588
I have two gentlemen from the police.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.929
They're trying to find a client of ours
who seems to have disappeared.

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:43.970
Ms Sullivan may have been
the last person that's seen him.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:46.980
I can't give out her number,
but would you like me to try it?

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:51.235
No. No, that's fine. Thanks a lot.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.613
Mr Simpson, did you client
ever mention a suitcase?

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:01.445
No. What sort of suitcase?

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:04.286
A black trolley. It's about this...

01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:07.201
Mr Simpson, thanks very much indeed
for your help,

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:09.712
and we'll be in touch
if we need anything else.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:14.216
Can I just ask?
This is a really nice paperclip.

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:15.672
Is it real gold?

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.971
Erm... it's 18 carat.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:23.180
- May I keep it?
- Yeah, knock yourself out, mate.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.894
Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:47.621
'What sort of suitcase?
It's probably just a mistake.'

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:51.583
Listen, I'm going back to work next week.
If they come, I'll talk to them.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.593
Greg...

01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:00.049
What did you tell them about me?

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:07.136
Stop it!

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.231
Why did you come back, Cath?

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:17.859
Did you come back for love?

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:21.692
Or was it for the moolah?

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:27.080
Nice place, Greg.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.786
I hope you like living alone.

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:31.372
Don't go! Wait, Catherine!

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:39.127
I'll always love you.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.474
- Hello?
- I was just about to call you, actually.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.644
The new sky's arrived.
I think you're going to be happy with it.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:23.397
And also we've finally got them
down to five minutes...

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.191
Naz, listen to me. I have an idea.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:28.236
I want you to transfer our robbery
to the actual bank.

01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:32.782
Well, that'd be brilliant, yes,
but they'd never allow it.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:36.248
I mean, even if we offer them a large fee,
banks are usually very...

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:38.287
Without a fee. We don't need to tell them.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:43.802
But you're talking about Sleets of Holborn?
The actual bank. Am I wrong?

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:47.304
Yes, you're absolutely right,
but I don't want them to know about it.

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:49.591
They're not going to let us perform there.

01:22:49.756 --> 01:22:54.227
'We don't ask them. We give our bankers
a day off and we use their staff instead.'

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:57.640
But if we use their staff,
they won't know they're taking part...

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:01.731
It doesn't make any difference. Their
staff and our staff have been trained.

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:05.524
Apart from you and me, no one's going
to know what the difference is.

01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:09.910
Our team will know. You can't fool them
into thinking that Holborn's a replica.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:13.163
They're in a van! They've been doing this
a thousand times!

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:17.418
They're going to think they're doing
a rehearsal. Our set is identical.

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:20.921
- And what if they do look out?
- 'Tell them we've changed locations.

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:24.379
'Park a catering truck in front
of the bank. Show them a film permit.

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:27.761
I want to go with them, Naz.
I need a suit just like theirs and a mask.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.470
'And a pistol. Just like the one
Christopher had. Silver with real bullets.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:35.432
'This is real, Naz,
so everything has to be real.'

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:38.726
Hello?

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:41.358
'Can you hear me?

01:23:42.392 --> 01:23:44.144
I need you for this, Naz.

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:47.022
'It won't work without you.'

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:04.377
'How was Oxford?'

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.171
'I've worked it out.

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:12.098
'The robbery itself has 12 scenarios.

01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:16.431
'And each one of those scenarios
has a subset of 104 permutations.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:20.056
'But they all have one thing in common.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:24.022
'They're all threatened
by the same chief contingency.'

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.152
- 'Was it Greg?'
- 'No.

01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:31.158
'The only way to stop
any information from leaking

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:36.322
'would be to eliminate all channels
through which it could possibly leak.'

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:39.287
Wait. I remember this.

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:45.589
'You understand what this means?

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.590
'We need to make arrangements.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:53.006
I know someone who could do it.
Discreetly.'

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:54.468
Now?

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:05.272
Well, no. Of course not now.

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:07.528
After the robbery.

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:11.691
It could be an accident
in the getaway vehicle.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:13.609
It's just an example.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:17.488
We've had this conversation before.
Don't you remember?

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:22.956
Do you even understand what I'm saying?

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:26.880
I'm talking about
getting rid of our people.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:32.716
Come on. Don't you remember?

01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:39.552
I-I don't... I don't remember.

01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:12.110
So, how many times have you done this?

01:27:14.938 --> 01:27:16.611
At least 400 times, sir.

01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:18.738
And has it changed?

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.404
No, no. It's always the same, sir.
We're professionals.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.665
But have you noticed the details in it?

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.702
You know, the way they repeat.

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.417
The rhythm. The poetry.

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:31.922
Aye, the poetry, eh?

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.299
Who the fuck is this poofter?

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:37.132
You won't get much out of him, sir.
He's a method actor.

01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:39.217
- He's a tit-head.
- Fuck off.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:43.725
We drive around in your van for hours
while people fuss around with your set,

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:47.980
and when it's ready we jump out
and do the same thing a million times.

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:52.143
I've robbed this bank at least
20 times a day now for six weeks.

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:54.528
I haven't got rich,
but I haven't been caught neither.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.279
- See?
- That sounds like...

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:58.736
- A tit-head.
- Fuck off, Nigel!

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:02.494
- Why are you always taking the piss?
- I'm not, dickhead, my character is.

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:06.077
- Then change your character.
- Why don't I change your nappy first?

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:09.743
- I'll make you my bitch, you prick.
- I'll shoot you in the head.

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:27.852
'Two minutes.'

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.439
Excuse, lads.

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:35.607
Oh, my God.

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:38.648
- God, look at that!
- Fucking hell! ls that the new sky?

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:42.159
- Whoa, whoa! What's going on out there?
- Wow!

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.196
- (How much was that?
- Number 2) Shut the fuck up!

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:48.616
- That is incredible.
- How much? How much was it?

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:54.209
Oh, Cath?
Sorry, I didn't realise you were here.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:56.123
A Mr Simpson keeps calling for you.

01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:59.839
Thanks, Charlie, but I'm not here.
Just forgot something downstairs.

01:29:05.298 --> 01:29:07.847
Hi. I'm Detective Inspector Morrell.
This is DI Aires.

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.853
- We'd like to speak to the manager.
- One moment, please.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.889
'30 seconds.'

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:19.317
Same old, same old.

01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:20.822
Yeah.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:23.070
Whoo!

01:29:26.111 --> 01:29:29.832
Let's be out in four minutes.
We have a special guest with us today.

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:34.502
- 'Ten seconds.'
- Come on!

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:37.793
'Five seconds.

01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:41.418
'Three, two, one.'

01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:42.882
Go!

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.466
Go! Go!

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:53.521
Come on!

01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:00.650
Put your hands on your head!

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:07.153
- Get down!
- Put your hands on your head!

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:09.993
Thank you, Naz.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:11.702
It's beautiful.

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:13.208
Go! Don't you move!

01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:16.961
- I've got three phones here!
- If I see you twitch...

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:30.893
- Any tricks and my mate'll shoot you!
- All right, all right!

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:33.429
- Quicker!
- OK!

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:36.519
- Freeze.
- Just a second.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:44.106
- New guy!
- Freeze, like the boss said!

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:47.446
Oh, nice!

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:52.577
- 'Two minutes.'
- Go on! Go!

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:56.209
Hands on your head!

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:13.685
Don't move!

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:17.977
It's not there!

01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:59.732
Ha-ha! Brilliant, you two tossers!

01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:03.314
- I'd say that's a cut, Naz. Naz?
- 'Four minutes.'

01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:07.151
- What the fuck is going on?
- What the hell happened, Derek?

01:32:07.313 --> 01:32:09.190
I'll be fucked if I know.

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:12.327
Nigel stopped, my gun went off
and he just fell on top of me.

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:15.239
That wasn't supposed to happen!

01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:17.282
Did you change the script or something?

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:24.711
- 'Five minutes.'
- Stop this fucking nonsense, Naz.

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.376
Nigel's had a bad fall.
He might need an ambulance.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:30.386
Who the fuck's this tart?

01:32:33.923 --> 01:32:38.520
Shut your fucking phone off already!

01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:51.825
Fucking... what the fuck?
What the fuck's wrong with him?

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.953
Oh, come on, stop it, for fuck's sake!
Oh, fucking...!

01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:57.284
'Six minutes.'

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:05.418
Tony, what the fuck's wrong with him?
Come on, man!

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.924
- Nigel!
- It's fucking real.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:11.132
- What?
- It's fucking real!

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:26.560
Stop. Number 1, stop.

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:33.282
Oh, fucking... fuck this.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:36.661
Naz, I'm done! I quit!

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:38.493
- Don't move.
- Fuck off!

01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:43.243
'Seven minutes.'

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:48.498
'What's going on in there?'

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:58.015
Tommy! Tommy, no!

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:02.891
Shut up!

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:05.477
- Oh, my God! Tommy!
<i>'</i> Shut up!

01:35:03.031 --> 01:35:07.002
'Ten minutes. The police are coming.
I can't wait any longer.'

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.355
Get up.

01:35:36.022 --> 01:35:37.899
This is mine, isn't it?

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.545
I'm out. Where are you?

01:36:00.964 --> 01:36:05.094
Right, anyone hurt? We're police officers.
Don't touch anything. It's all evidence.

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:07.137
Come on, Naz.

01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:16.863
Where are you, Naz? ls that you?

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.235
- Yeah. Yeah, they're on it.
- OK.

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:39.628
- Where's the cameras?
- One, two...

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:42.297
Go, go!

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.591
Stay there! Be calm! We'll be back!

01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:51.398
- Seen this?
- Stall them! Go, go, go!

01:36:54.434 --> 01:36:57.404
Armed robbery. Shots fired.
Have you got back-up?

01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:59.235
Naz, where are you?

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:26.951
'About the past
I can say very little.

01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:29.613
'Something fell down from the sky.

01:38:29.779 --> 01:38:35.127
'Technology, parts, bits
squashing me on to the pavement

01:38:35.284 --> 01:38:38.663
'and then nothing, a blank.

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:41.666
'Eventually the sun will set

01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:46.304
'and the universe will run down
like a toy whose spring is unwound.

01:38:46.462 --> 01:38:49.432
'Then there'll be no more music.
No more loops.

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:53.060
'Nothing to recreate.
No buildings to renovate.

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:57.019
'No people to rehearse
how to freeze, how to move.

01:38:58.224 --> 01:39:02.320
'For now, though, the clouds will part
and something will fall down,

01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:07.905
'turning, returning,
heading back, getting nearer.

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:10.494
'Here I am,

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:14.408
'reborn and waiting.

01:39:14.574 --> 01:39:16.076
'Again.'
