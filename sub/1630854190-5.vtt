WEBVTT

00:10.532 --> 00:12.577
<i>Previously on</i>
So Help Me Todd...

00:12.708 --> 00:14.057
Todd, what have you
been up to?

00:14.188 --> 00:16.364
Well... You lost your P.I. license,

00:16.494 --> 00:18.366
<i>and you almost went to jail.</i> I've hit bottom.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.367
<i>My mother, Margaret Wright,
works here,</i>

00:19.497 --> 00:20.716
<i>and I work for her.</i>

00:20.846 --> 00:21.717
I took this job

00:21.847 --> 00:23.501
<i>to work real cases.</i>

00:23.632 --> 00:25.112
<i>No, I gave you this job</i>

00:25.242 --> 00:27.070
- because you are broke.
-<i>Susan? That ring...</i>

00:27.201 --> 00:28.245
You were never getting anything
like that from me.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.640
Harry and I have split.

00:31.770 --> 00:32.902
<i>You just need to be
true to yourself</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:34.034
to come out from under.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.905
<i>You're right.</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:37.124
Just want to move past it.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.090
Thanks for coming down, Officer.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.832
Never seen
anything like this before.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.964
The car came in
three days ago?
That's right.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.184
It was banged up pretty bad
in the accident.

00:55.446 --> 00:56.621
When I looked underneath it,

00:56.752 --> 00:58.145
I found these.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.328
I need the name of
the car's owner.

01:11.897 --> 01:14.030
We look very nice today,
don't we?

01:14.161 --> 01:15.379
I am not taking you to lunch.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.033
I'm not asking.
I'm just...

01:17.164 --> 01:18.469
Wait, why not?
I need food.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.776
But where are you going
that's preventing you

01:20.906 --> 01:22.125
from buying me lunch?

01:22.256 --> 01:23.822
Nowhere, I have
a meeting nowhere.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.998
Okay...
nowhere meeting.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.435
What is happening?
What's the...

01:27.565 --> 01:29.785
What is... All right, if you must know,

01:29.915 --> 01:32.266
I have an interview today.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.877
- An interview? Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.488
Is this really... therapy?

01:37.619 --> 01:38.707
Todd... Yeah?

01:38.837 --> 01:40.448
I am applying
to be a member

01:40.578 --> 01:42.667
of the Portland Preservationist
Fellowship, the PPF.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.060
This is about jam?

01:44.191 --> 01:45.670
Preservation, not preserves.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.803
Todd, the PPF is

01:47.933 --> 01:49.761
an esteemed organization dedicated

01:49.892 --> 01:51.502
to restoring significant homes

01:51.633 --> 01:53.896
and having them designated
as historical landmarks.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.463
Oh, so it's just some nonsense

01:55.593 --> 01:56.464
lady time-filler thing.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.292
They do charitable work,

01:58.422 --> 01:59.945
they throw fabulous events... I'm supposed
to hold this?

02:00.076 --> 02:01.860
and everybody

02:01.991 --> 02:04.341
who is anybody

02:04.472 --> 02:06.343
is on the board.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.346
But...

02:09.477 --> 02:10.913
since when do you care
about old houses?

02:11.043 --> 02:12.262
Since Harry left.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.612
I need something to do
outside of the office,

02:14.743 --> 02:15.918
and these women...

02:16.048 --> 02:17.789
Okay, but you sold
our old house

02:17.920 --> 02:19.965
and moved into a brand-new
condo, so shouldn't you...

02:20.096 --> 02:21.184
I don't need these questions.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.230
I'm about to be interrogated

02:23.360 --> 02:25.057
by a group of
super elite ladies...

02:25.188 --> 02:27.277
...from the heights of
Portland Heights.

02:28.409 --> 02:32.326
And the hat protects you
from gamma rays, or...?

02:37.940 --> 02:41.291
Margaret, I must say
that you're certainly

02:41.422 --> 02:42.945
one of the most
impressive applicants

02:43.075 --> 02:44.164
we've had before us.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.643
Partner at Crest, Folding.

02:45.774 --> 02:49.038
Now you're dedicating time
to our mission?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.170
I mean, it's admirable.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.085
I passed the Yamhill Mansion

02:53.216 --> 02:55.000
every day
on my way to school as a girl.

02:55.131 --> 02:57.133
Thank you.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.527
And it was an eyesore,

02:59.657 --> 03:00.789
but look at it now.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.879
This gorgeous woodwork
perfectly restored.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.663
And who are we

03:05.794 --> 03:08.623
as Portlanders if we neglect
the jewels of our past?

03:08.753 --> 03:13.193
I see here that you live
in South Waterfront.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.325
- In new construction?
- Oh, yes.

03:15.456 --> 03:16.979
Um, it is a new neighborhood.

03:17.109 --> 03:21.070
Different but with views of
the historic homes

03:21.201 --> 03:23.115
across the water.

03:23.246 --> 03:26.771
And from my vantage point,
I feel almost like a,

03:26.902 --> 03:29.861
like a steward
or protector of the city.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.603
I can't think of
a more astute way

03:32.734 --> 03:33.604
of putting that.

03:33.735 --> 03:34.736
Beautifully said.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.651
- Right, Joan?
- Hmm.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.392
Oh, Good Lord.
Look at this mess.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.523
Clean this up immediately.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.482
I told you
she was incompetent.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.440
That cup alone cost $1,200.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.356
Did you know
that Margaret's son,

03:46.487 --> 03:48.576
Lawrence, works directly
with the governor?

03:48.706 --> 03:50.317
- Isn't that right, Margaret?
- Uh...

03:50.447 --> 03:51.796
That saucer is part of a set.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.711
I mean, you're just
a fool, aren't you?

03:53.842 --> 03:54.756
She also has a
very lovely daughter

03:54.886 --> 03:55.757
named Allison

03:55.887 --> 03:56.801
who is a physician...

03:56.932 --> 03:58.020
It's virtually impossible

03:58.150 --> 03:59.021
to get good service workers

03:59.151 --> 04:00.370
these days.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.329
- Fool.
- That-- Stop. That's enough.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.592
She's not a fool.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.246
She's a person.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.204
With a name.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.727
What is your name, dear?

04:09.858 --> 04:10.815
Judy.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.034
There.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.862
Her name is Judy.

04:15.080 --> 04:18.867
Thank you, and, uh, I'm terribly
sorry for what just happened.

04:19.911 --> 04:23.959
Well, thank you for coming in,
Ms. Wright.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.656
We'll be in touch.

04:29.921 --> 04:33.055
Margaret, do you know
how many of us have dreamt

04:33.185 --> 04:35.927
of-of standing up to Joan
like that?

04:36.058 --> 04:37.755
It was delicious.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.584
But now I'm not part of
the group, and...

04:40.715 --> 04:42.847
I've made myself a new enemy.

04:42.978 --> 04:46.242
Not exactly what I was looking
for in my life at this moment.

04:46.373 --> 04:49.593
Oh, yes. I heard about Harry.

04:49.724 --> 04:50.551
I'm so sorry.

04:50.681 --> 04:51.508
You know, it's been about a year

04:51.639 --> 04:53.031
since I lost my Milton.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.599
I never heard from you again
about his estate.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.035
I just couldn't
bring myself to ask you

04:57.166 --> 04:59.081
to do me any more favors.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.082
Felicity, please,

05:00.212 --> 05:01.388
I wanted to help.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.824
And you did,
it's just that

05:02.954 --> 05:04.739
I was so embarrassed by all of

05:04.869 --> 05:06.871
his bad business deals and...

05:07.002 --> 05:09.526
...everything else
I didn't know.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.224
Oh, you and me both.
Look at us.

05:12.355 --> 05:15.706
Two single women betrayed
by idiots.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.145
What on earth?

05:33.202 --> 05:35.030
What is going on?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.206
I knew there was something wrong
with her.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.816
Get her out of here.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.602
Please tell me
she's not having her arrested

05:41.732 --> 05:44.561
for breaking a coffee cup.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.174
Watch your head.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.271
Finally.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.274
All right, stick by my side... Mm-hmm.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.754
...and sign the papers.

06:03.885 --> 06:04.929
What papers? What's happening?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.453
Something about a coffee cup?

06:06.583 --> 06:08.324
Shh!
I owe you one, Jimmy.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.500
Another one.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.807
- Pretty sure I still owe you.
- Aw...

06:12.937 --> 06:15.287
- We all owe each other things.
- Okay, just sign.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.638
No, wait, what's going on?

06:17.768 --> 06:18.769
- What am I signing?
- Thank you, Mr. Cusick.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.858
Just sign right here.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.774
Thank you.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.255
You had me falsely sign
into a police station?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.213
- Who are you? Me?
- Todd.

06:28.344 --> 06:31.826
I can't see a potential client
unless they or a family member

06:31.956 --> 06:33.741
request my services.
Mm-hmm.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.612
This woman has no idea
I'm even here,

06:35.743 --> 06:37.309
but I have a feeling
she needs me.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.920
So we're lying now?

06:39.050 --> 06:41.096
We're not lying.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.967
It's a facade.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.100
Our intentions are good,
and if she doesn't want my help,

06:45.230 --> 06:46.362
we go away.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.624
Nothing happen--

06:47.755 --> 06:48.756
Here she is.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.758
No, you stay outside.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.021
Uh, I think
as Judy Cusick's son,

06:53.151 --> 06:54.457
I have a right to speak
to my own mother.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.851
Don't say a word.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.899
Do you remember me, dear?

07:02.030 --> 07:04.075
Margaret Wright, attorney.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.337
It's you...

07:05.468 --> 07:06.600
You stood up for me,

07:06.730 --> 07:07.818
and then you
followed me here. I...

07:07.949 --> 07:09.385
I thought
you might need some help.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.647
I don't have money for a lawyer.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.910
Money's not what's important
right now.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.783
Just tell us what's going on.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.613
I had a car accident,
- three days ago.
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.572
Someone T-boned me
at a stoplight,

07:22.703 --> 07:24.400
and my car was totaled.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.707
It was towed away,
and I guess the mechanic

07:26.837 --> 07:28.186
or somebody
called the police,

07:28.317 --> 07:29.231
because under my car

07:29.361 --> 07:32.103
they found... heroin.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.104
Heroin?

07:33.235 --> 07:34.976
Oh.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.151
This is not about a coffee cup.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.067
- How much heroin?
- Nine kilos.

07:39.197 --> 07:39.894
It's crazy.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.286
I have no idea how...

07:41.417 --> 07:43.114
And it was your car?

07:43.245 --> 07:44.768
Yes.
Okay.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.291
And where have you been lately?
I mean, in your car.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.423
Todd.
What?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.425
Only at home and at work.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.819
I'm always at work.
The hours are terrible.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.212
Although I do
run errands for them.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.563
For the Portland
Preservationist Fellowship?

07:56.693 --> 07:58.173
The PPF.Yeah.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.392
Picking up desserts
or taking packages

08:00.523 --> 08:02.307
to the post office.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.092
Little stuff.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.049
Oh, um...

08:05.180 --> 08:06.268
and the soaps.

08:06.398 --> 08:07.574
What soaps?

08:07.704 --> 08:09.140
Twice a month,
I have to go

08:09.271 --> 08:12.666
and pick up these fancy soaps
for the PPF.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.364
I guess they're really expensive
or whatever.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.800
And going where?

08:16.931 --> 08:18.541
- Canada.
- Canada?

08:18.672 --> 08:20.238
Across the border? Canada?

08:20.369 --> 08:23.938
Yeah, it's like a five-hour
drive up to Vancouver.

08:24.068 --> 08:27.158
I go up and back on a Saturday.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.291
- They pay me extra.
- Mm-hmm.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.814
And I-I go get the soaps and...

08:30.945 --> 08:32.729
Oh, no, uh, wait.
It's all right.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.426
We're almost done.
Legal counsel.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.124
Family member. Aggrieved.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.908
She's my mom.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.650
Judy, I'm going
to represent you.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.565
Is there somebody
we can call for you?

08:42.696 --> 08:44.872
No. I...

08:45.002 --> 08:47.222
I don't have anyone.

08:49.746 --> 08:52.096
Well, you have me.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.881
You're going to be all right.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.317
I'll be there for you
at the arraignment,

08:55.447 --> 08:58.886
and we are going to
get you out of here.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.366
Time's up. Let's go.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.808
Heroin.
Soaps? Canada?

09:07.938 --> 09:09.331
Someone is......running drugs?

09:09.461 --> 09:11.638
Through the PPF.And you wanted to be a member.

09:11.768 --> 09:15.293
But <i>they</i> didn't want me.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.487
Margaret,
what's happening?

09:35.618 --> 09:38.099
Uh, this is your arraignment, Judy.

09:38.229 --> 09:41.189
Um, we're going to discover more
about the charges.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.973
Hey, Lars.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.192
Does your wife know
you're eating that?

09:44.322 --> 09:45.454
With your
blood pressure issues?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.716
My wife is
my blood pressure issue.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.326
Margaret,
I got four minutes.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.806
I only need two.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.199
You got no case
with Judy Cusick.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.070
Not one that'll stick, anyway.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.290
Oh, you don't call possession
with intent "sticky"?

09:55.420 --> 09:56.726
You have to prove
awareness of possession,

09:56.857 --> 09:57.553
which is gonna be hard enough,

09:57.684 --> 09:59.250
but intent to sell?

09:59.381 --> 10:01.078
She doesn't even have
a parking ticket.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.080
She has two parking tickets.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.212
And now she has
an arrest for heroin.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.954
This is your offer.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.129
It's my best,
but it's my only one.

10:09.826 --> 10:13.177
Oh. Ten to 15 years?
You're out of your mind.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.440
Could be 25 if
it goes to a jury.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.008
Oh.

10:18.139 --> 10:18.922
This type of heroin
that they found on her

10:19.053 --> 10:20.184
has been trickling down
from Canada

10:20.315 --> 10:21.621
for the last ten months,
and now we got

10:21.751 --> 10:23.927
the CAC, the PPD, the DEA

10:24.058 --> 10:26.016
and every other agency
up our butts

10:26.147 --> 10:27.670
to crack down on it.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.150
The judge would like
to speak with you.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.500
Take your client the offer, Margaret,

10:31.631 --> 10:32.675
before it expires.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.342
We're rejecting the offer.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.736
It's utter nonsense.
You are being set up.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.520
You're an unwitting mule.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.740
So, what do we do?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.002
We're going to beat this.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.268
<i>She has no idea</i>

11:00.398 --> 11:01.835
Who ordered the soaps,

11:01.965 --> 11:04.707
or who loads them
and unloads them into her car.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.231
But she did say
that the events manager,

11:07.362 --> 11:09.756
Victor Dunn, was very upset

11:09.886 --> 11:12.454
when she got sick one weekend
and couldn't go and get them.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.456
Hmm.
Margaret,
I have these for you to sign.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.979
I just need the access
point to the club.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.502
- How I'm getting in there.
- Which club?

11:17.633 --> 11:19.417
These women are obviously
very protective

11:19.548 --> 11:21.028
of their little coven.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.856
- It is not going to be easy.
- Which women?

11:22.986 --> 11:24.422
The PPF.
The Portland Preservationist...

11:24.553 --> 11:27.295
Preservationist Fellowship.
Yeah, I'm a member.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.384
<i>You're</i> a member?

11:29.514 --> 11:31.778
Yeah. Peter's grandmother gives
a lot of money.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.431
She got me in,
but I never go.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.955
The whole thing feels
a little silly to me.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.826
Oh, yeah, my mom feels
the exact same way.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.959
Uh, y-you go to their events?

11:39.089 --> 11:40.656
The Labor Day boat party?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.266
Uh, no.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.572
We went to
the New Year's Eve thing

11:43.703 --> 11:45.095
at the, uh, Pittock Mansion.

11:45.226 --> 11:48.316
Mom, come on, remember,
they're criminals.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.666
- Wait, they're criminals?
- Yes, they're all filthy
little drug lords.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.102
We don't know that.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.147
We don't know anything yet.
We don't have...

11:53.277 --> 11:55.410
Have a way in? Now we do.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.803
Susan, what's the next event

11:56.933 --> 11:58.326
on their fancy
lady schedule?

11:58.456 --> 11:59.588
Well, they have small events
all the time.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.937
Let me look.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.504
They actually have
an event today.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.897
Um, there's a woman
who's speaking about

12:04.027 --> 12:06.508
the history of
the Yamhill Mansion,

12:06.638 --> 12:08.162
and there's a high tea.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.816
Great! We'll go to that.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.339
What's a high tea?

12:11.469 --> 12:12.906
I can't take you.
This event is women's only.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.864
But, uh, I could take you, Margaret.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.866
All right. Yes.

12:16.997 --> 12:20.348
Let's go, and maybe
we can ask Victor Dunn,

12:20.478 --> 12:22.742
the events manager,
some questions.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.482
If we wait to subpoena him
for a deposition,

12:24.613 --> 12:25.962
it could take weeks.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.442
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. What?

12:27.572 --> 12:29.836
Seriously? You two are
suddenly the investigators?

12:29.966 --> 12:31.098
What am I supposed
to do, then?

12:31.228 --> 12:32.708
Research them.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.666
Investigate the PPF.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.320
Their history,
their bank accounts,

12:36.451 --> 12:38.932
check for offshore accounts,
suspicious transactions.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.455
Oh, wait, should I shut down
every traffic light

12:40.585 --> 12:42.283
and ATM in Portland
while I'm at it?

12:42.413 --> 12:44.024
Mom, I got to
go in there.

12:44.154 --> 12:46.113
I need to taste, touch
and smell stuff.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.114
I'm an in-person guy.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.985
Not today, you're not.

12:49.116 --> 12:52.293
I'm sure Lyle can find some
information online somewhere.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.860
Oh, yes, go to Lyle.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.296
He's very good with techtronics.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.514
What? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.778
I am not going to him.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.171
Every time I speak, he looks
at me like I'm an idiot.

13:02.042 --> 13:02.912
Like that.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.740
All right, Todd.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.394
Come with me.

13:07.699 --> 13:08.744
Todd has something
to ask you.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.050
No, I don't.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.008
Not me.
Todd needs information

13:12.139 --> 13:14.097
about the PPF building,
the Yamhill Mansion

13:14.228 --> 13:16.404
- and whatever is going on inside.
- Done.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.666
Done. Give me a break.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.059
- I'll give you a break.
- Are you k...

13:19.189 --> 13:20.930
- Give me a break?
- Stop. Stop it, stop it.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.585
You two are working together
on this.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.253
Uh, hi. Uh,
I'm your Uber delivery driver

13:39.383 --> 13:41.429
- here with, uh, fresh eggs.
- Yeah, whatever.
You got to speak to Victor.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.648
Victor!

13:49.741 --> 13:52.179
Are you Colin?
You're three hours late.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.529
Uh, yes, I'm Colin.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.705
I'm so sorry,
and you must be Victor?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.968
And this is
what you are wearing?

13:59.099 --> 14:00.274
What part of
a black collared shirt

14:00.404 --> 14:01.797
and pressed slacks
did you not understand?

14:01.928 --> 14:05.757
Why do they insist on sending me
subpar talent?

14:05.888 --> 14:07.585
All right.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.066
Here, put this on.
Move, move, move.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.502
Join Olivia at the prep station

14:11.633 --> 14:13.113
and get started on
those tea sandwiches.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.811
Show this millennial
what to do.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.682
Yes, sir.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.728
So, uh,
what are we doing here?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.730
Dying slowly.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.340
What does it look like?

14:23.471 --> 14:25.168
Stack the disgusting
little sandwiches on the tray,

14:25.299 --> 14:27.779
serve them to the
disgusting monster ladies.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.826
Get your check, go home,
take a shame shower.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.784
All right.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.091
Let's stack
some disgusting sandwiches.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.055
Good afternoon, ladies.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.839
I understand you asked for me.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.536
How may I be of service?

14:45.667 --> 14:48.017
Yes, hello. Um,
I'm Margaret Wright,

14:48.148 --> 14:50.890
an attorney, and I was hoping
we could speak with you

14:51.020 --> 14:53.675
about one of your employees,
Judy Cusick.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.025
Well, I know nothing about her,

14:56.156 --> 14:59.202
except that her arrest has
left me short-staffed.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.771
Oh. Colin? Tea sandwiches?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.686
Good afternoon.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.209
These women do not have

15:06.340 --> 15:08.429
salad forks or napkins,

15:08.559 --> 15:10.735
or potatoes dauphinoise.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.781
- Fix that, please.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.610
Baby sannies, ladies?
Either of you?

15:15.740 --> 15:19.570
Now, do you think these are made
by elves or for them?

15:19.701 --> 15:21.268
Todd, what are you
doing here?

15:21.398 --> 15:22.617
I specifically asked you
not to come today,

15:22.747 --> 15:24.184
and now you have lied
your way inside.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.881
Well, it's not a lie,
it's a facade,

15:26.012 --> 15:27.578
like the one you used to get me
into the police station.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.928
Have you learned anything?

15:29.058 --> 15:31.582
What, in life
or as Colin?

15:31.713 --> 15:33.802
Because, um,
the staff here hates their jobs,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.673
Victor's a grouch, and
this whole place reeks of mold.

15:35.804 --> 15:36.761
Colin.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.328
Hmm? Ah.
Bus this table.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.026
Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies,

15:40.156 --> 15:41.984
I'm being disrespected.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.903
- Ah, Felicity.
- Margaret, what are you
doing here?

15:48.034 --> 15:49.557
I came here with my associate, Susan,

15:49.687 --> 15:53.039
to ask Victor some questions
about Judy Cusick.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.866
You remember, the girl who... What did they charge her with?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.216
What did she do?

15:56.346 --> 15:58.305
I can't talk about that here
like this.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.871
It was drugs.[gasps] What did he say?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.743
Drugs? Was she charged
with drugs?

16:01.873 --> 16:05.225
- It is a much longer story.
- Oh?

16:05.355 --> 16:06.791
Can I ask you something?

16:06.922 --> 16:08.837
Well, yes.
Do you know

16:08.968 --> 16:10.795
how long
Judy Cusick worked here,

16:10.926 --> 16:13.494
and was there ever anything
strange about her employment?

16:13.624 --> 16:15.322
- Strange? Judy? No.
- Mm-hmm.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.889
I mean, we hardly had
any interaction,

16:18.020 --> 16:19.282
but she seemed pleasant.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.980
Lovely, really.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.983
Was it Joan who ordered
all the soaps for the PPF?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.550
Soaps? What does soap have to do
with all of this?

16:26.681 --> 16:28.509
I don't know.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.858
Yet.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.562
Dear God!

16:38.693 --> 16:41.522
Shouldn't we be using
tiny plates for tiny sandwiches?

16:45.482 --> 16:47.136
Hey.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.792
Listen, if you want to have
some fun after work tonight,

16:50.922 --> 16:52.228
me and the rest of the staff
are gonna wash

16:52.359 --> 16:54.056
our brains out with bleach.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.676
You're still here?

17:05.807 --> 17:07.287
I'm always here.

17:07.417 --> 17:10.507
I ran some local info
on the PPF building.

17:10.638 --> 17:13.336
I have their property tax rate,
utility costs,

17:13.467 --> 17:15.643
Better Business Bureau rating,
a copy of their title,

17:15.773 --> 17:17.732
and the most recent assessments
of their building.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.560
What do you have?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.823
I have eagle cam.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.086
What is "eagle cam?"

17:24.217 --> 17:26.349
It's a webcam on a nest
in Forest Park.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.742
You know, watch the eagles
lay their eggs,

17:27.872 --> 17:29.222
keep 'em warm,

17:29.352 --> 17:30.484
hatch their eaglets,
fly away.

17:30.614 --> 17:34.009
And how does that pertain
to the case at hand?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.489
Well, eagle cam is about
a quarter mile

17:35.619 --> 17:36.838
from the PPF HQ.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.013
So, if you were
to scroll through

17:38.144 --> 17:39.232
a few weeks'
worth of footage,

17:39.362 --> 17:41.147
you'd notice
someone's in there,

17:41.277 --> 17:44.063
every night, late
at night, after dark.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.021
- Huh.
- So, I need to borrow

17:46.152 --> 17:47.283
some, like,
night vision goggles,

17:47.414 --> 17:49.068
- all your best toys.
- Not happening.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.721
But I'm going back there,

17:50.852 --> 17:52.114
around 2:00 a.m., to get inside

17:52.245 --> 17:52.984
and see what's what.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.638
No.

17:54.769 --> 17:55.552
Tomorrow, I'll go back there
and set up a camera

17:55.683 --> 17:56.640
closer to the house.

17:56.771 --> 17:57.728
We're not doing anything

17:57.859 --> 17:58.816
until we have more information.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.122
But they're drug dealers.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.645
It's like hunting vampires.

18:01.776 --> 18:02.603
You got to strike
in the middle of the night,

18:02.733 --> 18:03.647
with a silver bullet.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.127
That's werewolves.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.824
Can I have the goggles
anyway?

18:06.955 --> 18:08.565
No. No!

18:08.696 --> 18:11.655
You're not going back there
tonight. No.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.309
Okay, fine. Fine.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.789
I'm not going
back there.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.877
Whoa. Geez.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.276
Colin?

19:08.930 --> 19:10.497
What are you doing here?

19:10.627 --> 19:12.194
Are you living...

19:12.325 --> 19:13.761
at the Yamhill Mansion?

19:13.891 --> 19:14.849
Oh, yes.

19:14.979 --> 19:18.331
Living in splendor!

19:21.116 --> 19:22.335
Don't you just love...

19:22.465 --> 19:23.510
all of that fabulous wallpaper?

19:23.640 --> 19:26.034
How long
have you been living here?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.471
Since June? April?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.865
Gentrification drove me
out of North Portland.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.258
My rent went up $37.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.477
Well, I don't have $37.

19:34.608 --> 19:38.264
So, I decided
to gentrify myself.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.788
And no one knows you're here?

19:40.918 --> 19:44.792
Each dawn, I pack up my things
and slide them into the attic

19:44.922 --> 19:46.837
before the harpies arrive
to scream at each other

19:46.968 --> 19:48.622
about archival wainscoting.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.842
So, now, do tell.

19:51.973 --> 19:55.498
Are you here to rob us,
or are you a masher?

19:55.629 --> 19:58.545
No. No.
Also, my name isn't Colin,

19:58.675 --> 20:00.721
and I'm not in catering.
I'm a detective.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.897
And I saw you today
in the kitchen, selling drugs.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.986
Selling drugs?

20:05.116 --> 20:08.598
You were taking money,
covertly-- like this, I saw it.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.557
Oh, my dear boy.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.473
Those poor cater waiters are
buying leftover sandwiches

20:13.603 --> 20:15.301
and champagne from me
at below cost.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.259
They'd starve otherwise.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.001
I am not dealing drugs.

20:20.131 --> 20:22.177
Not like that
misbegotten Judy.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.179
Oh, dear Judy.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.181
Throwing her life away,

20:26.312 --> 20:28.139
just like the one before her, Davina.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.012
Davyna?
Divianna?

20:31.142 --> 20:33.057
And who is that?

20:33.188 --> 20:35.234
Judy's predecessor.

20:35.364 --> 20:38.933
She overdosed on drugs
and lapsed into a coma.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.195
- Huh.
- Six months ago.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.153
Mmm! Would you like a drink?

20:42.284 --> 20:43.590
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.547
But, uh,

20:44.678 --> 20:46.636
this Davina, o-or Divyna...

20:46.767 --> 20:48.290
Oh!

20:48.421 --> 20:49.900
Yes.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.599
Davina. Richards.

20:52.729 --> 20:55.079
The comatose
goddess of the night.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.343
Davina Richards.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.957
- What are you talking about?
- She's in a coma
here at this hospital.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.002
- I looked it up.
- And how can I
help you with that?

21:05.133 --> 21:06.134
I need information about her.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.875
I know nothing about it,

21:08.005 --> 21:09.659
and even though I'm your sister,
sharing it with you would be

21:09.790 --> 21:10.617
- a HIPAA violation.
- HIPAA violation, I know.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.836
How many times
do I have to explain

21:12.967 --> 21:13.620
- HIPPA violations to you?
- Just search on
your little doctor computer.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.578
Patient name, Davina Richards.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.363
Richards?
Coma ward, bed nine.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.800
Great, thank you.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.324
NURSE [over P.A.]:
Dr. Grant, ICU 4. Code black.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.371
Uh, I will see you
at dinner.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.634
- Okay.
- Just get out of the way.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.259
Oh.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.348
Uh, I am so sorry, Doctor.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.045
Didn't mean to...
Wait, who are you?

21:48.176 --> 21:50.657
Who am I? Who are you?

21:50.787 --> 21:52.572
Just a resident
on my rounds.

21:52.702 --> 21:53.921
It's my night on the coma ward.

21:54.051 --> 21:56.140
Well, then...

21:56.271 --> 21:57.751
let's see what you know.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.840
Look at this chart
a-and tell me what it says.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.885
Now.
O... kay.

22:02.016 --> 22:04.497
Okay, all right. Um...

22:04.627 --> 22:06.107
Davina Richards.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.848
- Uh-huh.
- Age 42.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.241
Has been in a coma
since April of this year.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.939
Overdosed on heroin and...

22:12.069 --> 22:14.898
- Oh, this is interesting.
- What is interesting?

22:15.029 --> 22:17.553
This specific organ toxicant
affected the patient's cells

22:17.684 --> 22:19.425
on an acute cuboidal level.

22:19.555 --> 22:22.079
Which means? Come on, now.
Talk to me like I'm a patient.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.299
The ingestive absorption
caused tachycardia.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.822
She did not habitually

22:25.953 --> 22:28.085
use drugs before she overdosed.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.218
Like...

22:30.349 --> 22:32.176
it was her first time.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.917
Uh-huh. Very good.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.266
Anything else?

22:35.397 --> 22:37.312
Right. Uh, sorry. Uh...

22:37.443 --> 22:39.009
Well, just the personal notes.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.882
Flowers. Uh...

22:42.012 --> 22:43.362
I guess those.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.102
Fresh flowers arrive

22:45.233 --> 22:47.844
every three days, and they're
to be placed near the patient.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.804
Perhaps as a remembered
scent, I guess.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.936
- You guess? You guess?
- No, it's just...

22:53.067 --> 22:55.112
I-- Look,
I'm-I'm not cutting it here!

22:55.243 --> 22:56.418
I'm a sham!

22:56.549 --> 22:57.419
I don't know who I am anymore.

22:57.550 --> 22:58.638
My dad was right,

22:58.768 --> 22:59.900
I am never gonna be a doctor.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.858
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me--

23:01.989 --> 23:03.425
Kieran-- stop that.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.774
Don't you let your father

23:04.905 --> 23:06.385
or anyone else
get in your head.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.125
You're gonna make
- a great doctor.
- Really?

23:08.256 --> 23:09.344
How do you know?

23:09.475 --> 23:10.606
Because I was you once,

23:10.737 --> 23:12.565
and look at me now,

23:12.695 --> 23:14.741
an accomplished finger surgeon.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.483
Do I still doubt myself
sometimes? No.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.616
But you will until you make it.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.358
Now get out there,

23:23.489 --> 23:25.404
and you save some lives.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.495
Thank you. Yeah.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.466
Joan, I want to thank you
so much for coming down.

23:44.597 --> 23:47.774
I need to speak to you about
a situation involving one of

23:47.904 --> 23:50.167
- your employees.
- If this is about overtime,

23:50.298 --> 23:51.691
I don't want to hear it.

23:51.821 --> 23:55.216
Each of my employees
signs a firm declaration

23:55.346 --> 23:56.870
on the first day of work.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.262
It is a not-for-profit
institution.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.438
No one is getting rich.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.396
Not even me.

24:01.527 --> 24:02.919
This is about Judy Cusick.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.486
Oh, the girl in jail?

24:04.617 --> 24:06.532
The incompetent one

24:06.662 --> 24:07.663
who broke the heirloom cup?

24:07.794 --> 24:09.317
Oh, but that's right,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.798
you're her great defender,
her personal bulldog.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.452
You have the audacity

24:13.582 --> 24:14.975
to tell me
how to conduct myself

24:15.105 --> 24:17.673
in my own organization.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.153
What, all for
some fumbling girl?

24:19.283 --> 24:20.720
Well, I hope
it's worth it to you.

24:20.850 --> 24:21.982
What, is she suing me?

24:22.635 --> 24:24.158
Ha!
Huh.

24:24.288 --> 24:25.376
Joan.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.161
Judy has been employed
by your foundation

24:27.291 --> 24:30.251
for the last six months--
as a housekeeper, a server--

24:30.381 --> 24:32.166
and she has run errands...

24:32.296 --> 24:34.864
...on, uh,
a bimonthly basis to Canada.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.040
Well, I can't keep track of
every worker,

24:37.171 --> 24:39.695
every task, every employee.

24:39.826 --> 24:43.482
Joan, I believe
Judy is innocent

24:43.612 --> 24:45.092
of the charges against her.

24:45.222 --> 24:46.485
Do you want to know
what this is about?

24:48.051 --> 24:50.619
I believe someone
in your organization

24:50.750 --> 24:52.403
is framing her

24:52.534 --> 24:53.622
for drug smuggling.

24:56.277 --> 24:59.367
This is...
This is outrageous.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.022
Whoa! Ah! Y-Your phone.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.980
Uh, Ms. Wright, your phone.
It-It's ringing.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.286
Sorry,

25:05.416 --> 25:06.853
I'm Ms. Wright's phone valet.

25:06.983 --> 25:08.855
Uh, hello.
Oh!

25:08.985 --> 25:10.465
How dare you come
after my organization,

25:10.596 --> 25:12.728
after... after my family!

25:13.947 --> 25:15.383
Her family?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.690
- Joan, I'm so sorry.
- Who's her family?

25:17.820 --> 25:20.344
Joan, don't leave. Joan.

25:20.475 --> 25:22.259
I will never forget
this cruelty.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.478
And if you persist in
this line of questioning,

25:23.609 --> 25:25.654
I will have my lawyers contact
your lawyer.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.700
Joan, I <i>am</i> my lawyer.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.266
Please don't leave
like this.

25:29.397 --> 25:30.920
Why are you so upset?

25:31.051 --> 25:32.792
She said, "My family."

25:32.922 --> 25:34.576
She has a personal stake
in this.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.796
Yeah, because her
daughter, Olivia,

25:36.926 --> 25:39.625
is that sullen cater waiter
at the Yamhill Mansion.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.583
And guess who was
kicked out of Wesleyan

25:41.714 --> 25:43.324
for selling drugs
to her dormmates?

25:43.454 --> 25:45.892
Talk about a facade of
Fakey McFakerson.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.155
Her daughter is running heroin
through her mother's foundation?

25:48.285 --> 25:52.899
And that is so much worse
than anything I've ever done.

26:00.384 --> 26:03.170
The state will demonstrate
that the defendant, Judy Cusick,

26:03.300 --> 26:05.781
attempted to transport
lethal doses of heroin

26:05.912 --> 26:07.348
across the Canadian border,

26:07.478 --> 26:10.307
under the streets of our city,

26:10.438 --> 26:15.399
destroying families
and lives in her wake...

26:15.530 --> 26:17.750
He's making me sound
like a monster.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.882
That's just part of his show.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.319
We'll be okay.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.626
My investigator is finding out
who framed you.

26:24.757 --> 26:27.542
...to those that
threaten our very humanity,

26:27.673 --> 26:30.327
who are we?

26:30.458 --> 26:32.721
Justice is
in our hands-- your hands.

26:32.852 --> 26:36.159
The state will also demonstrate
that Ms. Cusick acted...

26:50.434 --> 26:52.175
Hey.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.177
Colin?
Yeah?

26:54.308 --> 26:57.441
Oh, hi. Uh, what a coincidence.

26:57.572 --> 27:00.836
Uh, why are you crying
at the bus stop?

27:00.967 --> 27:04.535
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, I just, uh...

27:04.666 --> 27:07.538
I owe this evil woman $9,000.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.584
She's really overbearing.

27:09.715 --> 27:10.890
She never listens to me.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.674
She's kind of a shrill person,
you know?

27:12.805 --> 27:14.154
She wears shirts

27:14.284 --> 27:15.764
that are, like, $4,000
for no reason,

27:15.895 --> 27:16.765
and yet she still wants me

27:16.896 --> 27:17.766
to pay her back.

27:17.897 --> 27:18.811
I mean, it's ridiculous.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.421
I'm in big trouble.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.379
Mm. Yeah, sucks.
I've been there.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.816
- You have?
- Sure.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.774
My mom wants me to pay her back

27:25.905 --> 27:27.907
for my legal incident, but...

27:28.037 --> 27:30.605
I'm not making anything
working at the PPF, so...

27:30.736 --> 27:32.607
If only there was
a way that I could

27:32.738 --> 27:34.478
just make some extra money.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.351
I don't know, I'd do anything.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.920
Anything.

27:43.270 --> 27:44.967
I can't help you there.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.625
What?

27:50.756 --> 27:53.193
Oh.

27:56.109 --> 27:57.284
Thank you, D.A. Boatman.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.894
We will take a short recess

27:59.025 --> 28:00.896
and continue with defense's
opening statement.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.856
Court is in recess.

28:08.556 --> 28:11.037
Todd, what have you got?

28:11.167 --> 28:12.212
I don't know if it's Olivia.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.213
I mean, maybe,

28:13.343 --> 28:14.605
but she's not biting,

28:14.736 --> 28:16.259
and my crying was totally
on par today.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.608
What can I say, Mom?

28:17.739 --> 28:19.262
She's just a tough nut to crack.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.916
Mom?
Todd,

28:21.047 --> 28:22.352
I have to go.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.920
Felicity.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.053
- What are you doing here?
- I found something.

28:27.183 --> 28:29.708
I was looking at
Judy's old pay stubs,

28:29.838 --> 28:32.711
and our original
job application,

28:32.841 --> 28:35.844
and I came across these,

28:35.975 --> 28:40.414
old carbon receipts
from one of our ledgers.

28:40.544 --> 28:43.852
Someone was forging signatures
and making out blank checks

28:43.983 --> 28:46.072
for thousands and
thousands of dollars,

28:46.202 --> 28:50.076
but the only person who had
access to our ledgers is Victor.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.860
Or someone
from our support staff.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.341
Maybe Judy?

28:54.471 --> 28:56.735
Or Olivia. Joan's daughter.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.128
<i>I have something</i>

28:59.259 --> 29:00.434
that's gonna
blow your minds.

29:01.435 --> 29:02.828
- Oh.
- Todd, what are--

29:02.958 --> 29:04.133
Ew! Todd!

29:04.264 --> 29:05.961
I was still eating that salad.

29:06.092 --> 29:06.919
I don't know what
you're doing, Todd,

29:07.049 --> 29:08.355
other than making a mess.

29:08.485 --> 29:11.010
Okay, this is the leader
of the drug ring,

29:11.140 --> 29:12.925
and these are
all the suspects--

29:13.055 --> 29:14.274
Olivia, Joan, Victor.

29:14.404 --> 29:15.579
Now, Davina

29:15.710 --> 29:17.364
must've threatened
the drug leader,

29:17.494 --> 29:19.453
somehow, and needed
to be shut up.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.847
- So the drug leader drugged her.
- As you do.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.153
- Is the ground pepper drugs?
- No, it's a metaphor.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.546
For snow.
No, it's not.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.287
And which one is me?

29:27.417 --> 29:28.244
You're you. You're-you're
sitting right there.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.376
And which one put Davina
in a coma?

29:29.506 --> 29:30.638
The pepper.
And who's that?

29:30.769 --> 29:31.944
We don't know yet.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.032
Okay, you've totally lost
all of us.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.250
Is dinner over?
Look.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.948
The point I'm trying
to make is,

29:36.078 --> 29:37.906
what if Davina
wasn't in a coma?

29:38.037 --> 29:39.647
But she is in a coma.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.605
Yes, but what if she wasn't?

29:41.736 --> 29:43.216
I'm just a doctor,

29:43.346 --> 29:44.347
but I'm pretty sure that's
not how comas work.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.609
Actually, it might be.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.003
Listen, listen,
we create a ruse,

29:48.134 --> 29:49.962
a false front.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.573
We make people thing Davina has
come out of her coma,

29:52.703 --> 29:55.489
and then, once the drug dealer
hears she is awake,

29:55.619 --> 29:58.231
they'll be afraid Davina
is gonna expose them,

29:58.361 --> 30:00.581
and they'll attack Davina.

30:00.711 --> 30:02.888
We root the drug dealer out.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.455
Yes. We have all the emails
for everyone at the PPF, right?

30:05.586 --> 30:08.154
- Yes, it was part of discovery.
- Great, so...

30:08.284 --> 30:10.721
we'll send a wide email out
"accidentally"

30:10.852 --> 30:14.377
to everyone at the PPF
saying former employee Davina

30:14.508 --> 30:15.857
has come out of her coma,

30:15.988 --> 30:17.076
and she's been sent home
for whatever reason,

30:17.206 --> 30:18.555
with a full-time care nurse.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.296
Makes absolutely
no medical sense, but okay.

30:20.427 --> 30:21.863
I mean, whatever.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.604
We just need to suggest
that she's back,

30:23.734 --> 30:25.867
and she will be a surprise
witness in the trial.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.651
The drug dealer will
see the email.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.479
And zip over
to Davina's home...

30:30.567 --> 30:32.308
...to find out
if it's the truth.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.180
And that is what we call...

30:34.310 --> 30:36.312
- A sting.
- An ambush.

30:36.443 --> 30:37.879
A sting.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.794
- I-I was gonna say sting.
- Yeah.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.667
You two have been spending
way too much time together.

30:54.548 --> 30:57.159
Déjà vu.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.988
Waiting in a car with you
for something bad to happen.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.860
Well, Harry was a stakeout.
This is a sting.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.078
It's very different.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.341
And this time...

31:05.472 --> 31:07.126
we have snacks. No.

31:07.256 --> 31:08.301
You are not eating
in my car.

31:08.431 --> 31:09.955
What? I eat in my car.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.652
Yes, which used to be <i>my</i> car,

31:11.782 --> 31:13.523
and then you ate in it,
and now it's horrific.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.788
"Horrific" seems
a little unkind.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.703
I don't want
to ask this question,

31:19.834 --> 31:21.357
but what happens if...

31:21.488 --> 31:23.272
You have to pee? I'm wearing
an astronaut diaper.

31:23.403 --> 31:25.187
I have more.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.539
Why do you care so much?

31:29.670 --> 31:31.063
Or did you?

31:31.193 --> 31:32.760
About that stupid club?

31:34.196 --> 31:36.764
Are you really lonely?

31:38.331 --> 31:40.333
Well, I have my job
and my family,

31:40.463 --> 31:41.769
both of which I love very much,

31:41.900 --> 31:44.119
but...

31:44.250 --> 31:48.645
now, at night, I'm alone.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.648
But when I run into
people that I know,

31:51.779 --> 31:53.781
I... I have to--

31:53.912 --> 31:56.784
I-I feel I have to

31:56.915 --> 32:00.222
pretend that I'm okay.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.572
So I smile and act
like everything's fine,

32:02.703 --> 32:05.445
because I can't say,

32:05.575 --> 32:08.274
inside...

32:08.404 --> 32:09.666
"I'm lonely."

32:09.797 --> 32:13.888
Or not sad lonely, but...

32:14.019 --> 32:16.325
alone.

32:16.456 --> 32:19.111
Because it scares them.

32:19.241 --> 32:21.940
And then they pull away,
and so I smile bigger,

32:22.070 --> 32:24.899
and I act like
everything is fine and... Sounds exhausting.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.206
Oh, it is.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.209
I'm exhausted
just hearing about it.

32:33.908 --> 32:34.778
But seriously, Mom...

32:34.909 --> 32:36.345
Hmm?

32:37.825 --> 32:39.392
You're not alone.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.569
A car! Someone's here.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.266
Not yet. Patience.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.747
- We don't want to spoke them.
- Okay. [exhales] Okay.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.229
Okay, go!

32:53.797 --> 32:55.886
Go. Go.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.453
Hey!

32:59.890 --> 33:00.891
Joan?

33:06.723 --> 33:08.247
I'm not gonna lie.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.553
My daughter, Olivia,
has struggled.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.252
She's had drug issues
in the past, that's true.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.210
She was expelled
for selling them.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.343
Yes.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.998
And whatever you might
think of me, Margaret,

33:20.128 --> 33:21.825
I am a good mother
because I brought her home

33:21.956 --> 33:23.305
to live with me
and gave her a job

33:23.436 --> 33:26.265
so that I could watch
her more closely.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.354
I have her drug tested
three times a week.

33:28.484 --> 33:31.183
She's clean
and no longer in that world.

33:31.313 --> 33:33.402
Then what were you doing
at Davina's house?

33:33.533 --> 33:36.014
I...

33:38.625 --> 33:41.019
I was in love with her.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.544
I'm in love with her still.

33:45.762 --> 33:46.850
Davina Richards?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.330
Yes.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.636
You sent the flowers to her room
every week.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.377
When I heard
she came out of the coma,

33:51.507 --> 33:54.597
I... I rushed over to see her, and...

33:56.512 --> 33:58.558
Then I was devastated to hear
that it wasn't true.

33:59.602 --> 34:04.172
We also are really hoping
that she pulls through.

34:04.303 --> 34:07.697
Yeah, and the sting was
my mom's idea, so...

34:09.656 --> 34:11.919
If someone really tried
to murder the woman that I love,

34:12.050 --> 34:15.140
please find them
and make them pay.

34:15.270 --> 34:18.795
Joan, that bag is not yours,
is it?

34:18.926 --> 34:20.841
No. It's Davina's.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.974
She left it at my home,
and then she...

34:24.105 --> 34:25.498
When she didn't
come back...

34:25.628 --> 34:28.066
Uh, can I see that?
Yes.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.983
There's nothing of importance
in there, I think,

34:33.114 --> 34:35.508
not to anyone but me.

34:35.638 --> 34:38.119
- W-What is that?
- I-I don't know. It's trash.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.121
I couldn't bring myself
to throw any of it away.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.819
I have to go check something.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.212
Wait,
w-where are you going, Todd?

34:44.343 --> 34:45.126
Todd, where are
you going?

34:45.257 --> 34:46.954
Todd,
where are you going?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.017
Text Mom.

35:07.148 --> 35:10.151
Mom,
if I just cracked this case,

35:10.282 --> 35:13.937
you owe me lunch every day
for a week.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.463
<i>The state rests, Your Honor.</i>

35:17.593 --> 35:19.682
I'm scared, Margaret.

35:19.813 --> 35:20.988
I can't go to prison.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.382
Are you sure that we're... Just wait.

35:23.512 --> 35:26.820
Your Honor, I do have
one more witness to call.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.735
The defense calls

35:28.865 --> 35:30.040
Felicity Wallis.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.045
It's okay.

35:36.525 --> 35:37.700
<i>One of my client's jobs</i>

35:37.831 --> 35:41.226
was to drive to Canada
to pick up specialty soaps.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.401
- Is that correct?
- Yes, that's correct.

35:42.531 --> 35:45.839
Mm-hmm. And what is
the reason you had

35:45.969 --> 35:48.320
an employee drive five hours

35:48.450 --> 35:50.496
to Canada to pick up
these handmade soaps,

35:50.626 --> 35:52.106
rather than sourcing them
from Portland?

35:52.237 --> 35:53.325
Well,

35:53.455 --> 35:55.283
because they use
heirloom techniques

35:55.414 --> 35:58.330
to create these wonderful
handmade soaps.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.636
Uh-huh.
And-and prior to my client,

36:00.767 --> 36:03.204
Davina Richards was also
tasked with driving

36:03.335 --> 36:05.598
five hours to pick up soaps

36:05.728 --> 36:07.730
- from Canada, is that correct?
- Yeah, that's correct.

36:07.861 --> 36:10.168
And this same Davina Richards

36:10.298 --> 36:13.823
is now in
a drug overdose-induced coma.

36:13.954 --> 36:15.434
Ms. Wallis,

36:15.564 --> 36:18.045
do you own the business
next to the soap shop?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.525
Fresh and Easy Cleaners?

36:19.655 --> 36:21.744
No, I do not.
That was my husband's.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.137
Are you sure?

36:23.268 --> 36:24.704
I mean, I know
your deceased husband

36:24.834 --> 36:26.706
left your affairs
in a messy state of chaos,

36:26.836 --> 36:30.144
but just to jog
your memory, uh...

36:30.275 --> 36:33.495
What is the signature here

36:33.626 --> 36:36.890
of the person who renewed
the business license?

36:37.020 --> 36:40.589
- Felicity Wallis.
- Uh-huh.
But that is you, correct?

36:40.720 --> 36:41.764
Correct.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.463
And, uh,

36:44.593 --> 36:49.250
what is your title, according
to the business license?

36:49.381 --> 36:53.123
Owner, CEO. Ah.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.343
Your Honor,
I'd like to submit this license

36:55.474 --> 36:58.172
into evidence,
and I would also

36:58.303 --> 37:00.261
like to submit two exhibits.

37:00.392 --> 37:03.351
First, this torn piece
of dry cleaning bag

37:03.482 --> 37:05.788
found in Davina Richard's purse.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.529
And...

37:07.660 --> 37:10.924
this full bag
from the same cleaners,

37:11.054 --> 37:12.969
found in your office, Felicity,

37:13.100 --> 37:14.493
at the PPF headquarters.

37:14.623 --> 37:15.885
- Do you recognize them?
- Objection.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.148
- Relevance?
- Overruled.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.802
But get there, Ms. Wright.

37:19.933 --> 37:23.328
These bags are made
from the exact same plastic used

37:23.458 --> 37:25.721
to wrap heroin found
in my client's car.

37:25.852 --> 37:27.157
Fresh and Easy Cleaners

37:27.288 --> 37:30.422
served as a packaging center
for the drugs,

37:30.552 --> 37:32.206
and right next door to it

37:32.337 --> 37:34.077
was the specialty soap shop.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.776
You used unwitting PPF staff,

37:36.906 --> 37:39.518
like my client, to make
these trips to Canada,

37:39.648 --> 37:42.651
and while they were inside,
picking up the soap,

37:42.782 --> 37:46.786
you had your people
hide the heroin

37:46.916 --> 37:48.440
inside and under the car.

37:48.570 --> 37:52.139
I mean,
Davina and Judy had no idea

37:52.270 --> 37:53.619
that they were mules.

37:53.749 --> 37:55.098
And then,
you unloaded the drugs

37:55.229 --> 37:57.753
at the Yamhill Mansion,

37:57.884 --> 38:01.148
a place that nobody--
including the DEA--

38:01.279 --> 38:03.498
would ever think to look,

38:03.629 --> 38:07.023
making you the most
unlikely drug smuggler

38:07.154 --> 38:11.071
in all of Portland, Oregon.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.551
Is it correct

38:12.681 --> 38:15.641
that Davina Richards
was going to expose you,

38:15.771 --> 38:17.295
and is that why
you had her silenced

38:17.425 --> 38:19.732
with a staged overdose?

38:19.862 --> 38:21.516
Objection, are you serious?

38:21.647 --> 38:23.692
- Overruled.
- Your Honor, I pulled
Davina's phone records

38:23.823 --> 38:24.911
and text records.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.783
So many messages
going back and forth

38:27.914 --> 38:29.307
between you two.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.874
And it seems that you set up
a meeting with her

38:32.005 --> 38:35.051
on the very same day
she went into a coma.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.923
But what you didn't know

38:37.053 --> 38:39.665
is that Davina had
saved the evidence,

38:39.795 --> 38:43.582
a little shred of plastic,
in her purse,

38:43.712 --> 38:48.413
and that shred pointed us
right back to you.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.849
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:49.979 --> 38:51.285
This is just crazy.

38:51.416 --> 38:52.547
Order.

38:52.678 --> 38:53.722
Order!

38:53.853 --> 38:56.769
You nearly killed
Davina Richards,

38:56.899 --> 38:59.815
and you almost ruined
my client's life.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.426
Almost.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.953
No further questions,
Your Honor.

Hey, you can turn away
if you need to.

39:40.682 --> 39:44.033
Margaret, I owe you an apology.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.688
- I forgive you.
- We would be honored

39:46.819 --> 39:48.211
if you would become
one of our members.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.519
You have earned it
1,000 times over.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.174
I'm not sure it's quite me

39:54.304 --> 39:55.828
to be one of you.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.351
Thank you,

39:57.482 --> 39:59.222
but I respectfully pass.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.008
But I would love to continue
serving the PPF

40:02.138 --> 40:03.879
in all of
your future legal needs.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.758
All right,
I cracked the case,

40:12.888 --> 40:15.325
so you have to buy me
lunch all week,

40:15.456 --> 40:16.892
and I'm thinking lobster.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.678
Todd, you may have found
the dry cleaning plastic,

40:19.808 --> 40:22.071
but I found
the business license,

40:22.202 --> 40:24.204
and I pulled up
Davina's phone records...

40:24.334 --> 40:26.815
Are you trying to back out of
my weeklong success lunches?

40:26.946 --> 40:28.338
This is unfair, this is illegal.

40:28.469 --> 40:30.036
And you should know that
because you're a lawyer.

40:30.166 --> 40:31.994
Okay.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.694
We solved it together,
so I will pay for lunch,

40:35.824 --> 40:38.087
but I get to choose
where we eat.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.350
Henry Thiele's.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.004
No, that place is terrible.

40:42.135 --> 40:44.920
It's like dead food
that's been embalmed.

40:45.051 --> 40:48.054
Todd, your father and I had
our wedding reception there.

40:48.184 --> 40:49.838
Yeah, and they haven't
changed the menu since.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.971
Oh, I forgot my phone.
I'll be right back.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.712
Okay.

40:54.539 --> 40:55.844
Todd.

40:55.975 --> 40:57.150
Hmm?

40:57.280 --> 40:59.413
Your mother gave me a hat
with a fascinator.

40:59.544 --> 41:00.893
Oh, yeah.

41:01.023 --> 41:03.025
It's, uh, it's very fascinating.

41:03.156 --> 41:04.897
Yeah, you should actually
just probably take it off

41:05.027 --> 41:06.638
- and-and throw it out.
- I mean, I knew I was

41:06.768 --> 41:07.813
a hat person,
but, like, this hat?

41:07.943 --> 41:10.903
Yeah, pink antenna,
definitely the real you.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.905
Authentic.

41:13.035 --> 41:15.081
- Authentically me.
- Mm-hmm.

41:18.563 --> 41:19.825
Hey, babe.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.348
Yeah.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.176
Did you make dinner
reservations for tonight?

41:23.306 --> 41:25.091
Oh, perfect.
How was your day?

41:31.314 --> 41:33.316
Okay.

41:33.447 --> 41:38.104
So, maybe for lunch...

41:38.234 --> 41:40.715
lobster.
