WEBVTT

00:07.269 --> 00:10.009
I'd just back off

00:07.269 --> 00:10.009
a tidge if I were you.

00:10.019 --> 00:11.169
(deep voice): Rachel.

00:10.019 --> 00:11.169
- Billy?

00:11.179 --> 00:12.210
- I want to go home.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.250
- I'm getting married.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.250
(Nicole): It's the public stuff.

00:15.259 --> 00:17.019
- It's good to see you,

00:15.259 --> 00:17.019
Sheriff Haught.

00:17.030 --> 00:18.059
- These days, it's just Nicole.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.230
- Nicole, it's good

00:18.070 --> 00:20.230
to see you again.

00:20.239 --> 00:23.280
(Nicole): Mam helped her

00:20.239 --> 00:23.280
get Waverly out of the garden

00:23.289 --> 00:25.289
in exchange for you.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.219
- Vampire!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.219
(Doc): The only thing

00:27.230 --> 00:29.039
Wynonna detests more than demons

00:29.050 --> 00:30.170
is her exes.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.170
- Murder her.

00:30.179 --> 00:32.149
- Yah!

00:30.179 --> 00:32.149
- Untie me!

00:32.159 --> 00:33.200
(demon growling)

00:33.210 --> 00:35.119
- You could just call him,

00:33.210 --> 00:35.119
you know.

00:37.210 --> 00:40.049
(Western music)

00:41.170 --> 00:43.219
- Really trying for high noon,

00:41.170 --> 00:43.219
Haught?

00:43.229 --> 00:45.259
- Isn't that what you say

00:43.229 --> 00:45.259
after a night of drinking?

00:45.270 --> 00:46.259
"Hi, noon."

00:46.270 --> 00:48.039
- Oh...

00:48.219 --> 00:51.030
- Only I make fun

00:48.219 --> 00:51.030
of my drinking.

00:51.039 --> 00:54.140
(grunting, thudding)

00:54.149 --> 00:56.159
(uptempo music)

00:56.170 --> 00:57.270
(Wynonna exhales)

00:57.280 --> 00:59.079
Gonna use your

00:57.280 --> 00:59.079
fiancée's nunchuks?

00:59.090 --> 01:00.200
- My fists are my nunchuks.

01:00.210 --> 01:01.229
- Oh yeah?

01:01.240 --> 01:04.140
(music resumes)

01:08.109 --> 01:09.030
(Nicole screams)

01:09.039 --> 01:11.030
Oh, you dirty bitch!

01:11.039 --> 01:13.219
- Eighteen months to practice,

01:11.039 --> 01:13.219
all you got is older.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.189
(music resumes)

01:17.189 --> 01:18.260
(Nicole laughs)

01:17.189 --> 01:18.260
- Oh, no!

01:18.269 --> 01:19.230
(Wynonna grunting)

01:19.239 --> 01:22.269
- Hey! Only I sweep her

01:19.239 --> 01:22.269
off her feet.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.000
- Ugh... Really with

01:22.280 --> 01:25.000
the schmoop right now?

01:25.010 --> 01:27.230
(Nicole grunts)

01:25.010 --> 01:27.230
- I don't know who to cheer for.

01:27.239 --> 01:28.180
- Cheer for fitness.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.219
- Wrong!

01:29.230 --> 01:31.030
Cheer for me,

01:31.039 --> 01:32.140
'cause I got

01:31.039 --> 01:32.140
Hunt for Red Haughtober

01:32.150 --> 01:35.049
off the homestead

01:32.150 --> 01:35.049
and into her place of work.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.240
- The only work I'm doing

01:35.060 --> 01:37.240
is punching in at the...

01:37.250 --> 01:39.270
punching your face factory.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.109
- Hmm. You sure?

01:41.120 --> 01:43.280
Cop shop's just

01:41.120 --> 01:43.280
right over there!

01:43.289 --> 01:46.060
Across the hall.

01:43.289 --> 01:46.060
- Yeah! Why not just...

01:46.069 --> 01:48.069
boop on over there

01:46.069 --> 01:48.069
real quick. No?

01:48.079 --> 01:49.210
(Nicole): Hmm?

01:48.079 --> 01:49.210
- You know, just for fun!

01:49.289 --> 01:51.090
- Et tu, Earps?

01:51.099 --> 01:53.039
You lured me here

01:51.099 --> 01:53.039
under false pretenses.

01:53.049 --> 01:54.250
(sighing): Nicole.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.049
Purgatory needs a sheriff,

01:55.200 --> 01:59.049
and it's gotta be you.

01:59.060 --> 02:01.150
Everyone in town is saying so,

01:59.060 --> 02:01.150
right?

02:01.159 --> 02:03.140
- Well, that's really,

02:01.159 --> 02:03.140
really gratifying

02:03.150 --> 02:05.180
'cause they didn't vote for me

02:03.150 --> 02:05.180
so they don't get me.

02:05.189 --> 02:06.189
- Didn't you once say,

02:06.200 --> 02:08.159
"Everything good I have

02:06.200 --> 02:08.159
in my life is because

02:08.169 --> 02:10.080
I came back to

02:08.169 --> 02:10.080
the Ghost River Triangle"?

02:10.090 --> 02:12.020
- Didn't you once say,

02:10.090 --> 02:12.020
"Eat a dick"

02:12.030 --> 02:13.150
to a bunch of vampires?

02:13.159 --> 02:14.280
I should have said,

02:13.159 --> 02:14.280
"suck a dick."

02:15.080 --> 02:17.199
- Look, if this is guilt over

02:15.080 --> 02:17.199
what happened with Doc--

02:17.210 --> 02:20.099
- Whoa, wow, would you look

02:17.210 --> 02:20.099
at the time.

02:20.110 --> 02:22.039
It's whatever o'clock,

02:20.110 --> 02:22.039
and I have a wedding to plan.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.199
See you at trivia tonight.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.199
(Wynonna): Wow.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.229
That parent trap

02:24.210 --> 02:27.229
would have made Lohan puke.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.060
We barely even got a nibble.

02:29.069 --> 02:30.219
- And there's still a lineup

02:29.069 --> 02:30.219
of people

02:30.229 --> 02:31.289
in the sheriff's office.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.189
(sighing)

02:33.199 --> 02:37.120
- I was also not voted for.

02:33.199 --> 02:37.120
- Come on.

02:37.129 --> 02:40.219
It's not like BBD's given you

02:37.129 --> 02:40.219
an assignment this week.

02:40.229 --> 02:43.170
The town's nice and quiet.

02:43.180 --> 02:45.120
(sighing)

02:45.289 --> 02:48.079
(panting)

02:49.270 --> 02:51.120
(soft thud)

02:49.270 --> 02:51.120
- Oh!

02:55.170 --> 02:56.180
Holy shit!

02:57.079 --> 02:59.250
The Earp heir is gonna

02:57.079 --> 02:59.250
hate this.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.069
She's gonna kill us.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.020
She's gonna kill me!

03:05.159 --> 03:07.110
(muttering)

03:07.120 --> 03:09.120
Oh, noo!

03:09.129 --> 03:12.009
(howling)

03:12.020 --> 03:14.129
(theme music)

03:16.150 --> 03:19.189
♪ Cause I gave you

03:16.150 --> 03:19.189
all I got to give ♪

03:19.199 --> 03:22.099

(soft country music)

03:34.129 --> 03:36.069
- Hands off!

03:36.079 --> 03:39.069
Only active-duty police drink

03:36.079 --> 03:39.069
for free at my Shorty's.

03:39.079 --> 03:41.060
- Well, I'm sheriff emeritus.

03:41.069 --> 03:43.120
- Sheriff avoidus, more like it.

03:43.129 --> 03:45.090
Help me set up

03:43.129 --> 03:45.090
for trivia night.

03:45.099 --> 03:48.009
- Okay, fine, but no more

03:45.099 --> 03:48.009
sheriff talk.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.210
Everybody keeps asking me.

03:49.219 --> 03:51.050
- Well, you were the best...

03:51.060 --> 03:53.009
since yours truly.

03:53.020 --> 03:55.009
I filled out the slacks

03:53.020 --> 03:55.009
a little better.

03:55.020 --> 03:58.020
- Know what I would like

03:55.020 --> 03:58.020
to talk about?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.289
Hints for tonight's trivia.

04:00.270 --> 04:03.120
- What local deputy had

04:00.270 --> 04:03.120
the highest clearance rate

04:03.129 --> 04:07.080
in the Ghost River Triangle

04:03.129 --> 04:07.080
of the past ten years?

04:07.090 --> 04:09.240
- It's just not for me anymore.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.050
- You know, that sounds like

04:12.060 --> 04:13.280
a fancy way of saying

04:12.060 --> 04:13.280
you're butthurt.

04:13.289 --> 04:15.270
(scoffing)

04:15.280 --> 04:17.180
- Why would I be butthurt?

04:17.189 --> 04:19.060
Wait, what have you heard?

04:17.189 --> 04:19.060
- Nothing.

04:19.069 --> 04:20.149
Why, did you do something?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.240
- I'm too busy, okay?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.240
I've got Rachel.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.139
She's a full-time job.

04:24.149 --> 04:25.120
- And yet you're in the dark

04:25.129 --> 04:27.250
about what she did

04:25.129 --> 04:27.250
at her part-time job.

04:27.259 --> 04:28.279
- Oh no. Where'd she puke?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.129
- It's her invisible monster

04:29.000 --> 04:32.129
boyfriend downstairs.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.149
- Damn it.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.149
She let him out.

04:37.129 --> 04:38.230
- Ugh! Don't tell me,

04:38.240 --> 04:42.029
community watch clocked someone

04:38.240 --> 04:42.029
mowing their lawn in the buff.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.000
What's up?

04:43.009 --> 04:44.090
This life or death, Gil?

04:44.100 --> 04:46.029
- Every pharmacy is out

04:44.100 --> 04:46.029
of moisturizer.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.029
- Trag'.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.029
Also, come on, man.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.149
- Where's Sheriff Clayborn?

04:51.159 --> 04:52.209
- Uh...

04:52.220 --> 04:55.250
- Wintering on a kibbutz.

04:52.220 --> 04:55.250
Let's see,

04:55.259 --> 04:59.110
any of these complaints not read

04:55.259 --> 04:59.110
like a Yelp review?

04:59.120 --> 05:03.269
"My neighbour put Guy Fieri ass

04:59.120 --> 05:03.269
flames on his car?"

05:03.279 --> 05:05.100
Who cares?!

05:05.110 --> 05:07.120
Oh, this one's legit.

05:07.129 --> 05:08.110
If I ask for shredded lettuce,

05:08.120 --> 05:10.040
you better believe

05:08.120 --> 05:10.040
I don't want full leaf.

05:10.050 --> 05:13.040
- Look. These people are under

05:10.050 --> 05:13.040
a lot of stress.

05:13.050 --> 05:14.250
Supply runs have halted.

05:14.259 --> 05:16.000
Cupboards are bare.

05:16.009 --> 05:18.240
Not to mention everything else

05:16.009 --> 05:18.240
that happens around here.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.269
- Exactly.

05:19.279 --> 05:23.019
So much happens here,

05:19.279 --> 05:23.019
so relax!

05:23.029 --> 05:24.100
Go outside.

05:24.110 --> 05:26.209
It's above zero out there!

05:26.220 --> 05:29.120
'Cause right now,

05:26.220 --> 05:29.120
things are fine.

05:30.050 --> 05:31.050
We offed Pumpkin-head.

05:31.060 --> 05:34.120
Amon's disappeared

05:31.060 --> 05:34.120
into the ether, we're good.

05:34.129 --> 05:37.220
- Ah yeah!

05:34.129 --> 05:37.220
You brought the lattes!

05:38.149 --> 05:40.240
(grunting)

05:38.149 --> 05:40.240
Oh...

05:40.250 --> 05:41.269
Sorry.

05:43.269 --> 05:45.209
No, this, this isn't mine.

05:45.220 --> 05:51.050
- Not your... cherry pie that

05:45.220 --> 05:51.050
you spilled all over your apron?

05:51.060 --> 05:54.259
- Not my cherry pie.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.259
But a cherry pie,

05:54.269 --> 05:56.040
which we need to investigate

05:56.050 --> 05:59.019
because whoever's making these

05:56.050 --> 05:59.019
cherry pies is still out there

05:59.029 --> 06:01.220
and they might, uh...

06:01.230 --> 06:03.040
bake again.

06:03.139 --> 06:05.050
- Nice.

06:03.139 --> 06:05.050
- You are terrible at codes.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.069
- Damn.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.069
- Go jerk off about it, Gil.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.250
So where is this...

06:12.199 --> 06:14.079
...murdered pie?

06:17.230 --> 06:19.060
- Didn't there used to be

06:17.230 --> 06:19.060
a morgue?

06:19.069 --> 06:21.269
- Oh yeah!

06:19.069 --> 06:21.269
- Yeah, the rats took it over.

06:21.279 --> 06:23.060
- Ah, good for them.

06:23.069 --> 06:25.269
Who's the stiff?

06:23.069 --> 06:25.269
- Ricky Brock.

06:26.069 --> 06:28.230
What a tragedy.

06:26.069 --> 06:28.230
- Left a wife and little kids?

06:28.240 --> 06:29.220
- No. A real loner,

06:29.230 --> 06:31.269
and, by all accounts,

06:29.230 --> 06:31.269
a real jerk, but...

06:33.189 --> 06:35.050
he won Shorty's Trivia

06:33.189 --> 06:35.050
last week.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.000
- Oh, my god!

06:38.019 --> 06:39.100
Is that tragic?

06:39.110 --> 06:40.279
- No, I mean, uh...

06:40.290 --> 06:42.060
he was part of the community.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.269
Well, our community, not yours,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.269
obviously, 'cause you lost.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.149
- I know I was eliminated,

06:44.279 --> 06:47.149
but how was I supposed to know

06:47.159 --> 06:49.069
Tobey Maguire isn't

06:47.159 --> 06:49.069
Spider-Man anymore?

06:49.079 --> 06:51.029
- We all know.

06:49.079 --> 06:51.029
- Well, on the bright side,

06:51.040 --> 06:52.110
at least it means that

06:52.120 --> 06:53.259
Ricky won't be at tonight's

06:52.120 --> 06:53.259
Trivia finals!

06:53.269 --> 06:55.090
- True!

06:56.269 --> 06:58.180
- I am so sorry.

06:58.189 --> 07:01.139
That is not a bright side.

06:58.189 --> 07:01.139
- No.

07:01.149 --> 07:03.129
- Y'all brainiacs really got

07:01.149 --> 07:03.129
your priorities out of whack.

07:03.139 --> 07:04.240
Before I got knocked out,

07:04.250 --> 07:06.149
I was obsessed

07:04.250 --> 07:06.149
with trivia night too.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.149
- That aside, look at this.

07:11.079 --> 07:13.279
- Whoa!

07:11.079 --> 07:13.279
(chuckling)

07:15.189 --> 07:17.019
Okay, my turn to react

07:15.189 --> 07:17.019
inappropriately,

07:17.029 --> 07:18.259
but we're all seeing

07:17.029 --> 07:18.259
the vampire bite marks, right?

07:18.269 --> 07:19.259
(Waverly): Yeah.

07:19.269 --> 07:21.269
- If Mr. "I Don't Shoot

07:19.269 --> 07:21.269
People in the Back"

07:21.279 --> 07:24.129
still bites people in the neck,

07:21.279 --> 07:24.129
I guess I'm not so bad anymore.

07:24.139 --> 07:26.189
And even if I am, so is he.

07:27.129 --> 07:29.230
- You don't need an excuse

07:27.129 --> 07:29.230
to go talk to Doc.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.079
- I don't want to talk to him.

07:32.090 --> 07:33.259
(sniffling): I need to talk

07:32.090 --> 07:33.259
to him

07:33.269 --> 07:36.259
about the... poor...

07:39.180 --> 07:41.159
- Doc couldn't have done this,

07:39.180 --> 07:41.159
right?

07:48.230 --> 07:51.189
(ominous music)

07:52.259 --> 07:53.170
- No.

07:53.180 --> 07:56.209
No, no, no, no, no!

08:11.149 --> 08:12.290
- It's a yes from me, dawg.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.110
- So we decoupled the caboose,

08:15.120 --> 08:16.160
but then my boys and I,

08:16.170 --> 08:20.250
we realized that the greenbacks,

08:16.170 --> 08:20.250
they're in another car...

08:21.209 --> 08:24.100
- I have great stories too.

08:24.110 --> 08:27.110
Mostly about killing demons.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.060
With this gun.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.060
(Doc): It's okay,

08:30.069 --> 08:31.199
you are safe.

08:32.149 --> 08:34.090
You wanna tell everyone

08:32.149 --> 08:34.090
you're not here to kill them?

08:34.100 --> 08:35.289
- Not everyone.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.110
Doc, I uh,

08:37.120 --> 08:40.120
need a private interrogation

08:37.120 --> 08:40.120
with your moustache.

08:40.129 --> 08:42.000
(blowing raspberry)

08:51.159 --> 08:52.210
Hey.

08:53.110 --> 08:54.259
It's okay. I get it.

08:54.269 --> 08:57.179
You're a vamp.

08:54.269 --> 08:57.179
You got the hungs,

08:57.190 --> 08:59.049
that guy was num-nums.

09:00.169 --> 09:03.159
Welcome back

09:00.169 --> 09:03.159
to the moral low ground.

09:03.169 --> 09:05.000
There's a great mattress

09:03.169 --> 09:05.000
down here

09:05.009 --> 09:07.080
we could absolutely demolish.

09:07.190 --> 09:09.179
- What you're implying...

09:09.190 --> 09:11.059
is faulty.

09:12.049 --> 09:16.149
I have devised a morally sound

09:12.049 --> 09:16.149
way to satisfy my needs.

09:16.159 --> 09:18.250
- Morally sound?

09:18.259 --> 09:21.269
Um. You're chilling

09:18.259 --> 09:21.269
at a demon bar.

09:21.279 --> 09:25.159
- They may be demons,

09:21.279 --> 09:25.159
but even they would never...

09:25.169 --> 09:26.259
- Oh, shoot someone in the back?

09:26.269 --> 09:28.029
Well, how about the front?

09:28.039 --> 09:30.100
(growling)

09:31.200 --> 09:33.100
(Dallas): You alright, Doc?

09:34.190 --> 09:36.049
- He's fine.

09:37.269 --> 09:40.009
Hey. Weirdest thing...

09:40.019 --> 09:43.000
Some demon with fangs

09:40.019 --> 09:43.000
killed a human.

09:43.009 --> 09:45.019
Any of you have any idea

09:43.009 --> 09:45.019
who did it?

09:47.179 --> 09:50.190
- No one here has information

09:47.179 --> 09:50.190
for you.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.179
But I will keep my ear

09:50.200 --> 09:52.179
to the ground.

09:52.190 --> 09:55.009
- From now, on I suggest

09:55.019 --> 09:59.039
you do not just pop into

09:55.019 --> 09:59.039
The Glory Hole.

09:59.049 --> 10:03.139
- Well, isn't that the point

09:59.049 --> 10:03.139
of a glory hole?

10:06.070 --> 10:07.289
Since when do you have minions?

10:16.179 --> 10:18.269
- Goddamn law enforcement.

10:18.279 --> 10:21.259
- The gun does tend

10:18.279 --> 10:21.259
to go to their head.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.200
- Hey Lil' Mama.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.000
What's... shakin'?

10:32.009 --> 10:34.070
- Right, okay.

10:32.009 --> 10:34.070
(inhaling deeply)

10:34.080 --> 10:36.070
Any idea why I might've

10:34.080 --> 10:36.070
called you here?

10:36.080 --> 10:37.159
- You so want me to be gay,

10:36.080 --> 10:37.159
don't you?

10:37.169 --> 10:41.070
- Well, we would support you

10:37.169 --> 10:41.070
and buy you the right albums,

10:41.080 --> 10:43.019
but...

10:43.029 --> 10:45.080
nice deflection. Billy.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.169
What happened?

10:48.220 --> 10:50.100
- You were there.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.139
Typical teen stuff.

10:54.039 --> 10:56.059
- We should have told you

10:54.039 --> 10:56.059
he was in the basement.

10:56.070 --> 10:58.039
- The Clantons turned him

10:56.070 --> 10:58.039
into that thing.

10:58.049 --> 10:59.269
And you said we'd fix him.

10:59.279 --> 11:00.289
- And from now on,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.009
we're gonna talk more openly

11:01.000 --> 11:03.009
about our problems.

11:03.019 --> 11:05.049
- Like Chicken-kicker?

11:05.059 --> 11:07.200
- Rachel. You promised!

11:05.059 --> 11:07.200
- I'm sorry!

11:07.210 --> 11:09.200
- Rachel. You swore!

11:07.210 --> 11:09.200
- Nicole, I'm sorry!

11:09.210 --> 11:13.100
- You do not speak about that,

11:09.210 --> 11:13.100
ever. Ever, Rachel!

11:13.110 --> 11:15.169
- I'm just...

11:13.110 --> 11:15.169
I'm just worked up.

11:15.179 --> 11:19.049
Okay, my never-BF turned into

11:15.179 --> 11:19.049
an invisible monster.

11:21.049 --> 11:24.220
For what it's worth, he seemed

11:21.049 --> 11:24.220
really weak when I let him out.

11:24.230 --> 11:26.250
Not a threat at all.

11:27.279 --> 11:29.129
But I'm still sorry.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.169
- Hey.

11:38.120 --> 11:38.289
What are we listening to?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.090
- A podcast about Gaga.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.159
- What?

11:41.100 --> 11:43.159
You sure you're not even bi?

11:43.169 --> 11:44.279
(chuckling)

11:44.289 --> 11:47.210
- You know,

11:44.289 --> 11:47.210
he'd forgive you too. Doc.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.279
If you just told him why.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.059
- Hey.

11:57.039 --> 11:59.080
(Jeremy exhaling): Do not start.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.090
I know my heels

11:59.090 --> 12:01.090
aren't touching the ground.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.090
- I was gonna mention

12:01.100 --> 12:03.090
the two stiffs.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.110
- Oh. Yeah.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.169
It was on me to drag

12:05.120 --> 12:07.169
in the second body.

12:07.179 --> 12:09.159
I hurt my back.

12:07.179 --> 12:09.159
- Oh...

12:09.169 --> 12:13.110
- Number two here is

12:09.169 --> 12:13.110
trivia nights' latest winner.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.019
- Niles!

12:16.029 --> 12:17.289
The butcher? Ugh!

12:18.000 --> 12:19.240
He knew all the capital cities.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.070
- He even got Dodoma!

12:21.080 --> 12:22.149
(scoffing)

12:23.029 --> 12:25.029
- We should focus

12:23.029 --> 12:25.029
on other things.

12:25.039 --> 12:27.179
- Yeah.

12:25.039 --> 12:27.179
- Like, how did this happen?

12:27.190 --> 12:28.289
Did Doc?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.240
- That's what I thought

12:29.000 --> 12:31.240
at first, but...

12:31.250 --> 12:33.120
look at this.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.110
- Bite marks.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.059
- Well, actually...

12:38.129 --> 12:40.250
- Those are too far apart

12:38.129 --> 12:40.250
to be teeth.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.039
- That means our beautiful

12:40.259 --> 12:43.039
cowboy is in the clear, but...

12:43.049 --> 12:45.240
Hey, what is going on

12:43.049 --> 12:45.240
with him and Wynonna anyway?

12:45.250 --> 12:47.240
- Doc thinks that...

12:45.250 --> 12:47.240
(sighing)

12:47.250 --> 12:52.080
since Wynonna shot Holt,

12:47.250 --> 12:52.080
she's off the chain.

12:52.090 --> 12:53.169
- Is she?

12:55.240 --> 12:57.090
- Huh.

12:57.259 --> 12:59.129
Does this seem light to you?

13:01.149 --> 13:03.110
- Yeah. Kinda.

13:08.259 --> 13:10.159
Whoa! Waverly!

13:11.149 --> 13:13.259
There's nothing obstructing it.

13:11.149 --> 13:13.259
- It's empty!

13:13.269 --> 13:14.289
(Jeremy): Whoa.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.139
- No brains.

13:16.149 --> 13:18.009
- Try number one!

13:19.159 --> 13:20.240
(gasps)

13:21.049 --> 13:23.049
- Weirdly satisfying.

13:21.049 --> 13:23.049
- Yeah!

13:23.059 --> 13:26.059
- So what, it's a brain-stealing

13:23.059 --> 13:26.059
demon?

13:26.269 --> 13:29.070
Why would they want

13:26.269 --> 13:29.070
human brains?

13:29.080 --> 13:32.179
- I don't know, as a souvenir,

13:29.080 --> 13:32.179
or a trophy?

13:32.190 --> 13:35.039
Or something worse.

13:39.230 --> 13:41.070
- Mmm,

13:41.080 --> 13:44.190
I can feel

13:41.080 --> 13:44.190
the facts and numbers.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.269
Mmm...

13:46.279 --> 13:49.029
- That the last brain, then?

13:49.039 --> 13:51.000
- Not by a shot long.

13:51.009 --> 13:52.149
- Long shot.

13:53.269 --> 13:55.259
- Is that the thing?

13:55.269 --> 13:57.269
Not by a long shot.

13:57.279 --> 14:00.149
We're gonna need more brains.

14:00.159 --> 14:02.059
A lot more brains.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.149
(coughing)

14:09.200 --> 14:11.019
It's okay, I'm okay.

14:11.029 --> 14:14.120
Don't worry. Don't worry.

14:11.029 --> 14:14.120
(sighing)

14:14.129 --> 14:17.049
- Yeah, I wasn't.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.019
tell me about

14:23.240 --> 14:26.019
my least favourite murderer.

14:26.029 --> 14:28.149
(Jeremy): Okay, well,

14:26.029 --> 14:28.149
the unsub is a male,

14:28.159 --> 14:29.279
mid-thirties, early forties.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.279
(Waverly): Strong, because

14:30.289 --> 14:33.269
the victims don't have

14:30.289 --> 14:33.269
many defence wounds.

14:33.279 --> 14:36.080
He seems to have incapacitated

14:33.279 --> 14:36.080
them easily.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.259
- We're sure it's not

14:37.009 --> 14:38.259
a sexy vampire?

14:38.269 --> 14:41.049
- Can confirm.

14:38.269 --> 14:41.049
- Right.

14:41.059 --> 14:42.269
- The thing is,

14:41.059 --> 14:42.269
the murders aren't the goal.

14:42.279 --> 14:45.059
The brains are actually

14:42.279 --> 14:45.059
what the demon's after.

14:45.070 --> 14:46.200
- But...

14:46.210 --> 14:49.120
the weapon that caused

14:46.210 --> 14:49.120
these puncture marks

14:49.129 --> 14:50.230
might be painted.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.289
Yeah, there's a turquoise

14:50.240 --> 14:52.289
smudging left behind,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
which isn't very demonic.

14:55.009 --> 14:58.129
- Yeah, but the demon

14:55.009 --> 14:58.129
got the brains out

14:58.139 --> 15:00.100
without a trace

14:58.139 --> 15:00.100
of a wound, so...

15:00.110 --> 15:02.000
- Baby girl. It's a demon.

15:02.009 --> 15:03.159
What kind of human wants brains?

15:03.169 --> 15:05.169
- Yeah. Thank you, Wynonna.

15:05.179 --> 15:09.080
(scoffing): Maybe a human

15:05.179 --> 15:09.080
with a fetish.

15:09.090 --> 15:13.090
Or a compulsive obsession

15:09.090 --> 15:13.090
with intelligence.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.279
Like a lot of killers,

15:14.289 --> 15:18.009
he's probably frustrated

15:14.289 --> 15:18.009
at the way he's seen.

15:18.019 --> 15:20.009
In this case, with being seen

15:18.019 --> 15:20.009
as smart.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.250
- Yeah, like you. Right now.

15:21.259 --> 15:24.029
- Save it for trivia,

15:21.259 --> 15:24.029
downward don't.

15:24.039 --> 15:26.129
- You save it for trivia,

15:24.039 --> 15:26.129
online degree.

15:26.139 --> 15:28.179
(Waverly and Wynonna gasp)

15:28.190 --> 15:31.169
- I am going to crush you!

15:31.179 --> 15:35.100
- Okay. Alright, so, see,

15:31.179 --> 15:35.100
see, what I think,

15:35.110 --> 15:37.169
as a smart also,

15:37.179 --> 15:39.169
my hunch about this guy is, uh,

15:39.179 --> 15:42.039
he's a mur... derer. Okay?

15:42.049 --> 15:46.019
So, so he's like a murder,

15:42.049 --> 15:46.019
he's a murder fan.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.049
Who likes to--

15:46.029 --> 15:48.049
(quacking)

15:49.039 --> 15:50.179
- I left my rubber ducky

15:49.039 --> 15:50.179
keychain

15:50.190 --> 15:52.230
at the sheriff's office.

15:50.190 --> 15:52.230
(quacking)

15:53.080 --> 15:55.000
With a sign that says,

15:55.009 --> 15:57.070
"If you have an emergency,

15:55.009 --> 15:57.070
quack it."

15:59.080 --> 16:02.259
- Lemme guess. Your neighbour

15:59.080 --> 16:02.259
wore white after labour day.

16:02.269 --> 16:05.019
- No. This is serious.

16:02.269 --> 16:05.019
- Oh.

16:05.279 --> 16:07.059
Then what is it?

16:07.070 --> 16:09.070
- So, there's this couple,

16:07.070 --> 16:09.070
a guy and a girl.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.080
They were fighting.

16:10.090 --> 16:13.230
- Did he hit her?

16:10.090 --> 16:13.230
- No, but, I'm sure he has.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.279
He just kept yelling at her

16:13.240 --> 16:15.279
that he owned her.

16:15.289 --> 16:18.000
Like, "I own you, I own you!"

16:18.009 --> 16:19.279
And then, he threw her

16:18.009 --> 16:19.279
into his car.

16:19.289 --> 16:21.179
- God, that sounds awful.

16:19.289 --> 16:21.179
- Well, yeah, it was.

16:21.190 --> 16:24.190
- Abusive relationship

16:21.190 --> 16:24.190
trumps brain man. Let's go.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.029
- Where was it?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.029
- Oh well, they drove off.

16:27.039 --> 16:28.080
- Did you get a plate?

16:27.039 --> 16:28.080
- No,

16:28.090 --> 16:31.100
but he had, he had flames

16:28.090 --> 16:31.100
painted on the front of his car.

16:31.110 --> 16:32.200
Like really lame.

16:32.210 --> 16:34.259
- Nosy neighbours finally

16:32.210 --> 16:34.259
pay off.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.179
I've got the address here.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.179
(Waverly): Okay.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.259
- Alright, let's go.

16:37.269 --> 16:39.159
- Hey...

16:37.269 --> 16:39.159
(door opens)

16:39.169 --> 16:41.129
That's not all.

16:41.139 --> 16:42.039
- What is it?

16:42.049 --> 16:43.289
- I tried to break the fight up.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.139
Told the guy to cool off.

16:45.149 --> 16:46.200
- Did he attack you?

16:46.210 --> 16:47.289
- Oh, worse.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
While he was dragging

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
the girl to the car,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.269
he turned to me and he said,

16:52.250 --> 16:54.169
"I wish you would eat shit."

16:55.100 --> 16:56.240
- Yeah, yeah that's

16:55.100 --> 16:56.240
weird phrasing.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.279
- Yeah.

16:59.009 --> 17:00.120
And then I went and ate shit.

17:01.169 --> 17:02.269
I don't even like shit.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.119
- Well, we know

17:09.279 --> 17:12.119
he has a small dick.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.079
- I probably dated him.

17:18.009 --> 17:19.250
Open up, it's the--

17:19.259 --> 17:21.000
- Earp Sisters!

17:21.009 --> 17:22.160
(chuckling in the house)

17:26.220 --> 17:27.289
- Uh, hi?

17:28.220 --> 17:29.170
- Something funny?

17:29.180 --> 17:31.119
- Yeah, I was...

17:31.130 --> 17:34.009
thinking about something funny

17:31.130 --> 17:34.009
I saw on the internet.

17:34.019 --> 17:36.039
There's a guy, said something

17:34.019 --> 17:36.039
funny and then...

17:36.049 --> 17:38.200
his friend said something

17:36.049 --> 17:38.200
funny back to him.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.099
- Yeah, I think I saw that one.

17:42.009 --> 17:44.019
- Doug? Doug Warner?

17:45.119 --> 17:47.190
- Used to be my name.

17:48.069 --> 17:48.250
- Used to?

17:48.259 --> 17:50.200
- Mmm...

17:48.259 --> 17:50.200
(clearing throat)

17:50.210 --> 17:52.019
- We're coming in.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.039
(stammering): Your wish

17:52.029 --> 17:54.039
is my command.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.140
Any hail today?

17:59.119 --> 18:01.259
- Uh, no.

18:01.269 --> 18:03.160
- Hail is not ice pellets.

18:03.170 --> 18:04.160
A lot of people confuse them

18:04.170 --> 18:06.269
but it's actually different

18:04.170 --> 18:06.269
precipitations.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.099
Just the kind of stuff

18:07.210 --> 18:09.099
you pick up.

18:09.109 --> 18:10.180
(snapping his fingers)

18:10.190 --> 18:12.059
Weather facts.

18:13.089 --> 18:14.049
- Neat.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.259
- Yeah, I got a lot of 'em.

18:15.269 --> 18:17.170
Don't get me started on sleet.

18:18.069 --> 18:19.210
You know, sleet actually

18:18.069 --> 18:19.210
goes east west.

18:19.220 --> 18:21.059
You know how rain is up down?

18:21.069 --> 18:23.200
Sleet is actually all dependent

18:21.069 --> 18:23.200
on the jet stream.

18:23.210 --> 18:26.160
It's a big stream of wind

18:23.210 --> 18:26.160
that flies through the...

18:26.170 --> 18:29.220
it's just a scam perpetrated

18:26.170 --> 18:29.220
by the post office, actually.

18:29.230 --> 18:31.039
(softly): Hey.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.180
Are you doing okay?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.220
- Just battling the trolls.

18:36.230 --> 18:38.269
(chuckling)

18:36.230 --> 18:38.269
- Listen.

18:38.279 --> 18:40.289
We're here to help.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.210
We can get you out.

18:42.220 --> 18:45.269
- Yeah, no you can't,

18:42.220 --> 18:45.269
but... no big.

18:49.109 --> 18:51.220
- What're you eating there?

18:49.109 --> 18:51.220
What kind of sandwich is that?

18:51.230 --> 18:53.099
- Brain.

18:53.109 --> 18:54.130
Cow.

18:55.039 --> 18:56.140
Girl meat sandwich.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.200
All cows are girls.

18:59.210 --> 19:02.220
Boy cows are bulls.

18:59.210 --> 19:02.220
- I too graduated kindergarten.

19:02.230 --> 19:04.019
(banging on table)

19:04.029 --> 19:05.069
- You think I'm dumb?

19:05.079 --> 19:06.279
- I think you have

19:05.079 --> 19:06.279
brain on your chin.

19:06.289 --> 19:09.130
- I do? Did I get it?

19:09.140 --> 19:10.230
I used to be dumb,

19:10.240 --> 19:12.289
but I'm actually getting

19:10.240 --> 19:12.289
a lot smarter.

19:14.009 --> 19:15.140
- Would you say you have a...

19:15.150 --> 19:19.160
compulsive obsession

19:15.150 --> 19:19.160
with intelligence?

19:19.170 --> 19:20.109
- Ginny get in here!

19:20.119 --> 19:21.220
- Leave her the fuck alone,

19:20.119 --> 19:21.220
Doug.

19:21.230 --> 19:24.230
- It's not Doug.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.059
My name is Kuru!

19:27.069 --> 19:30.170
(snorting): Honestly this guy.

19:27.069 --> 19:30.170
(Kuru): Ginny! Get here!

19:30.180 --> 19:32.099
(Wynonna): Waverly!

19:30.180 --> 19:32.099
He's our demon killer!

19:32.109 --> 19:34.029
- You, you don't have

19:32.109 --> 19:34.029
to do this, Ginny.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.240
- 'Scuse me.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.230
- Peacemaker's not glowing!

19:35.250 --> 19:37.230
So he's kinda just a dude!

19:37.240 --> 19:40.089
Human.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.089
- I am the demon Kuru.

19:40.099 --> 19:42.019
- He's a human.

19:40.099 --> 19:42.019
(Kuru): Ginny.

19:43.109 --> 19:45.089
- No. She's not yours, buddy.

19:45.099 --> 19:47.109
- Just lemme go to him.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.059
- Sweetheart, it's okay.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.059
- What?

19:49.069 --> 19:51.039
(Waverly whispering)

19:52.200 --> 19:53.259
(screaming)

19:53.269 --> 19:56.009
- You did not just

19:53.269 --> 19:56.009
throw brain at me!

19:56.019 --> 19:57.250
Argh!

19:56.019 --> 19:57.250
- I wish her to die.

19:57.259 --> 19:59.240
I wish her to die.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.289
- Then come to me.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.289
Take my hand.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.160
Ow! Watch the nails, girl. Ow!

20:05.170 --> 20:08.059
- Why... Oh, come on!

20:10.009 --> 20:11.039
(Waverly): Shit!

20:11.049 --> 20:13.099
- No way he jumped that fence.

20:13.109 --> 20:14.220
- Hey.

20:14.230 --> 20:17.160
Listen. We're gonna get you

20:14.230 --> 20:17.160
somewhere safe, okay?

20:18.089 --> 20:22.109
Well, I'm gonna go wash

20:18.089 --> 20:22.109
this brain off my shirt, but...

20:22.119 --> 20:24.240
Wynonna will.

20:22.119 --> 20:24.240
(Ginny): Cool...

20:24.250 --> 20:28.009
Can't wait to be exactly

20:24.250 --> 20:28.009
back here in a couple hours.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.150
(clicking)

20:35.160 --> 20:37.269
(Wynonna): Listen,

20:35.160 --> 20:37.269
we wanna help you.

20:37.279 --> 20:40.210
I've seen this before,

20:37.279 --> 20:40.210
you're the victim.

20:40.220 --> 20:41.259
(sighing)

20:41.269 --> 20:44.069
Can you just put

20:41.269 --> 20:44.069
the phone down a sec?

20:44.079 --> 20:46.220
- Nah, I'm good.

20:44.079 --> 20:46.220
- Okay. I get it.

20:49.130 --> 20:51.150
I get it. I look like a cop.

20:52.019 --> 20:53.259
Well, I'm not.

20:53.269 --> 20:57.210
I've spent several New Year's

20:53.269 --> 20:57.210
Eveses in drunk tanks.

20:57.220 --> 20:58.279
You're safe with me.

20:58.289 --> 21:02.109
(whooshing)

20:58.289 --> 21:02.109
(Ginny): Oh shit.

21:02.119 --> 21:03.220
That's the gun that kills us!

21:02.119 --> 21:03.220
You're her?

21:03.230 --> 21:07.119
- Damn right. Hands up.

21:03.230 --> 21:07.119
- Girl, it's chill.

21:07.130 --> 21:10.099
Okay, I'm chill.

21:07.130 --> 21:10.099
- It's you.

21:10.109 --> 21:11.069
You did it, didn't you?

21:11.079 --> 21:14.099
- Yes, but it's not me,

21:11.079 --> 21:14.099
it's his wishes!

21:14.289 --> 21:16.079
- Wishes?

21:17.049 --> 21:18.279
- I'm a genie.

21:18.289 --> 21:21.150
Kuru's wish is my command.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.029
And his wishes

21:21.160 --> 21:24.029
are fucking nuts.

21:29.059 --> 21:30.259
- Okay. A genie?

21:30.269 --> 21:32.259
Did Doug find

21:30.269 --> 21:32.259
a lamp or something?

21:32.269 --> 21:35.190
- One flamboyant genie

21:32.269 --> 21:35.190
lives in a lamp,

21:35.200 --> 21:37.250
now suddenly we all live

21:35.200 --> 21:37.250
in lamps. Ugh.

21:37.259 --> 21:41.039
- Well, what about a trophy?

21:37.259 --> 21:41.039
We dusted a Marzaniok once.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.119
- That's cute.

21:42.130 --> 21:44.180
No, I just needed a new master.

21:44.190 --> 21:46.240
- Master? Honey, no.

21:46.250 --> 21:50.019
- Doug bumped into me

21:46.250 --> 21:50.019
at the bar, and that was it.

21:50.029 --> 21:52.059
That's how it works.

21:52.069 --> 21:53.220
And now he calls the shots.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.230
- Not so fast.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.210
Show her what you got.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.210
- Oh, yeah.

21:58.269 --> 22:00.170
Your nails.

22:00.180 --> 22:04.059
Same colour as the wounds

22:00.180 --> 22:04.059
found on the murder victims.

22:04.069 --> 22:05.230
- Your nails poison them.

22:04.069 --> 22:05.230
- Yeah.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.140
But only cause

22:05.240 --> 22:07.140
he wished them to.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.269
- Why does he want you

22:07.150 --> 22:08.269
to kill them?

22:08.279 --> 22:10.170
- He wants to be the smartest

22:08.279 --> 22:10.170
guy in town

22:10.180 --> 22:12.210
so he makes me kill

22:10.180 --> 22:12.210
all the smartest people in town.

22:12.220 --> 22:16.150
I mean, usually keepers--

22:12.220 --> 22:16.150
- Keepers?

22:16.160 --> 22:18.009
You need to stop.

22:18.019 --> 22:19.220
- Okay, well, usually

22:18.019 --> 22:19.220
they're all like,

22:19.230 --> 22:24.049
"I want guns for hands," or like

22:19.230 --> 22:24.049
a laser dick, but not Doug.

22:24.059 --> 22:26.210
- Why doesn't he just wish to be

22:24.059 --> 22:26.210
the smartest guy in town?

22:26.220 --> 22:28.269
- Because he's not smart.

22:28.279 --> 22:31.140
(Jeremy): Okay, look.

22:28.279 --> 22:31.140
He's already killed twice.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.279
Three wishes.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.279
That's all you get.

22:32.289 --> 22:34.240
- Dude wished

22:32.289 --> 22:34.240
for infinite wishes.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.089
- Isn't that against

22:34.250 --> 22:36.089
genie rules?

22:36.289 --> 22:39.210
- No.

22:36.289 --> 22:39.210
And don't be superstitious.

22:39.220 --> 22:41.289
Look. He has infinite wishes,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.009
so no matter what

22:42.000 --> 22:44.009
we talk about here,

22:44.019 --> 22:46.109
I'm still bound to keep

22:44.019 --> 22:46.109
makin' them all come true.

22:46.119 --> 22:49.250
- Except... you won't.

22:49.259 --> 22:51.059
Because...

22:51.069 --> 22:54.259
when you say he bumped into you

22:51.069 --> 22:54.259
at the bar and became your--

22:54.269 --> 22:56.140
- Lord?

22:56.150 --> 22:58.069
- Yeah. None of the words

22:56.150 --> 22:58.069
you're using

22:58.079 --> 23:00.140
are working for me, okay?

23:01.089 --> 23:03.039
You meant literally

23:01.089 --> 23:03.039
bumped into you.

23:03.150 --> 23:04.180
'Cause when you were

23:03.150 --> 23:04.180
at the house,

23:04.190 --> 23:05.230
you kept reaching

23:04.190 --> 23:05.230
for each other.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.150
He needs to be touching you

23:07.160 --> 23:09.079
for his wish to come true.

23:09.089 --> 23:10.170
- Pretty much.

23:11.009 --> 23:12.059
Okay, totally much.

23:13.099 --> 23:14.230
- Nice.

23:13.099 --> 23:14.230
- Thanks.

23:15.049 --> 23:17.019
And I'm not leaving your side.

23:17.029 --> 23:20.029
- Okay, well, I hope it works,

23:17.029 --> 23:20.029
but he is my...

23:20.039 --> 23:23.019
- Don't say it!

23:20.039 --> 23:23.019
- He's mine, I'm his. Forever.

23:23.029 --> 23:25.160
- Did he wish to be immortal?

23:23.029 --> 23:25.160
- No. I can't do that.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.240
Or bring back people

23:25.170 --> 23:27.240
from the dead.

23:27.250 --> 23:29.180
- Can you at least pretend

23:27.250 --> 23:29.180
you watched Aladdin?

23:29.190 --> 23:31.230
(lip smacking, scoffing)

23:29.190 --> 23:31.230
- I'm stuck with brain-eater

23:31.240 --> 23:34.000
till he croaks.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.000
- Uh. Which reminds me,

23:34.009 --> 23:35.200
Wynonna, I need

23:34.009 --> 23:35.200
to show you something.

23:39.019 --> 23:43.180
- Okay. Solid convo, but can

23:39.019 --> 23:43.180
I get my phone back now?

23:45.109 --> 23:48.009
I need to see if my tweet's

23:45.109 --> 23:48.009
doing numbers.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.009
- Are you gonna make me watch

23:49.160 --> 23:51.009
Aladdin?

23:51.019 --> 23:53.190
- I-I was researching obscure

23:51.019 --> 23:53.190
diseases for trivia night

23:53.200 --> 23:54.289
when I came across "Kuru,"

23:55.000 --> 23:56.190
the name that Doug

23:55.000 --> 23:56.190
wants to be called.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.220
It's a condition

23:56.200 --> 23:58.220
that some cannibals get

23:58.230 --> 23:59.200
when they eat human brains.

23:59.210 --> 24:02.240
- Like Mad Cow Disease?

23:59.210 --> 24:02.240
- Yes, exactly.

24:02.250 --> 24:05.089
I think that Doug

24:02.250 --> 24:05.089
ate human brain,

24:05.099 --> 24:06.160
got sick, googled it,

24:06.170 --> 24:09.019
and started calling himself

24:06.170 --> 24:09.019
by the name of that sickness.

24:09.029 --> 24:11.240
- Okay. Well, he's not exactly

24:09.029 --> 24:11.240
the best of us.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.150
Which is why I'm not leaving

24:11.250 --> 24:13.150
here till he's caught.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.099
- Yes! Great idea.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.099
You stay here.

24:15.109 --> 24:17.220
I go to trivia night.

24:15.109 --> 24:17.220
- No, Jeremy!

24:17.230 --> 24:18.279
We need to find a killer.

24:18.289 --> 24:20.170
There will be other

24:18.289 --> 24:20.170
trivia nights.

24:20.180 --> 24:23.170
- No, no, no! Tonight is

24:20.180 --> 24:23.170
the finals! It's critical.

24:24.180 --> 24:26.039
- Jeremy.

24:27.109 --> 24:29.150
It's your beautiful brain.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.220
- What?

24:31.089 --> 24:33.049
- Trivia night!

24:34.029 --> 24:36.240
Ginny said he wants to find

24:34.029 --> 24:36.240
the smartest people

24:36.250 --> 24:39.089
so he can

24:36.250 --> 24:39.089
eat their brains!

24:39.099 --> 24:40.160
Your brain!

24:40.170 --> 24:42.019
- That's nuts.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.019
- It is,

24:42.029 --> 24:44.109
because random trivia's

24:42.029 --> 24:44.109
obviously not

24:44.119 --> 24:45.250
an accurate way to judge

24:44.119 --> 24:45.250
intelligence

24:45.259 --> 24:47.009
otherwise I'd still be in it.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.190
- Well...

24:47.019 --> 24:49.190
- 100% coo-coo for Kuru Puffs!

24:49.200 --> 24:52.230
- Okay, okay. So that is why

24:49.200 --> 24:52.230
we're all so obsessed.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.170
- Yes. And why I'm not.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.170
Anymore.

24:54.180 --> 24:56.119
- It has nothing to do

24:54.180 --> 24:56.119
with you losing?

24:56.130 --> 24:58.230
- No. It's the wish.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.009
- Okay. Yeah, no.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.009
That-that makes sense

25:01.019 --> 25:04.000
in a that-makes-no-sense

25:01.019 --> 25:04.000
kinda way.

25:04.009 --> 25:06.210
Great, okay, if you are

25:04.009 --> 25:06.210
good to guard the genie,

25:06.220 --> 25:09.220
then me, Waverly, Nicole and Doc

25:06.220 --> 25:09.220
can go to trivia night

25:09.230 --> 25:11.099
and take Kuru-Doug down.

25:09.230 --> 25:11.099
- Cool.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.150
It shouldn't be hard.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.160
Without his genie he'll just be

25:12.160 --> 25:14.160
a normal numpty. Okay.

25:14.170 --> 25:17.019
I'm gonna call Waverly

25:14.170 --> 25:17.019
and tell her the plan.

25:17.029 --> 25:18.019
You call Doc.

25:18.029 --> 25:19.160
- Okay.

25:19.170 --> 25:20.259
- Okay, so it's a wish.

25:20.269 --> 25:23.180
And the guy will be at trivia

25:20.269 --> 25:23.180
and then we'll do a takedown?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.059
- The way you say "takedown"...

25:26.069 --> 25:29.089
I can feel your sheriff

25:26.069 --> 25:29.089
senses tingling.

25:29.099 --> 25:32.039
You loved your job.

25:29.099 --> 25:32.039
- Well, now I love trivia.

25:32.049 --> 25:33.069
And you.

25:33.079 --> 25:34.230
In that order.

25:35.230 --> 25:38.000
God, what an awful wish!

25:38.009 --> 25:39.230
- Don't change the subject.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.079
- Hey, maybe you should try

25:39.240 --> 25:42.079
club soda on your...

25:42.089 --> 25:44.039
(breathing heavily)

25:45.140 --> 25:46.180
- Hey.

25:46.190 --> 25:48.089
(sighing)

25:48.210 --> 25:50.180
- I'd lost everything.

25:50.190 --> 25:53.000
The woman I love, my friends.

25:54.089 --> 25:56.099
Then I lost the election.

25:56.109 --> 25:57.210
To Holt.

25:58.250 --> 26:02.210
It was the last straw,

25:58.250 --> 26:02.210
so I did something.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.289
- Is this a froggy thing again?

26:06.140 --> 26:09.039
- Now everybody

26:06.140 --> 26:09.039
in Purgatory hates me.

26:10.049 --> 26:11.059
- So?

26:11.069 --> 26:14.259
Everyone hates Wynonna,

26:11.069 --> 26:14.259
and she still Wynonnas.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.259
I'm sure it's fine.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.259
- It's not.

26:19.289 --> 26:21.009
- Look.

26:22.059 --> 26:23.259
Brain stain aside,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.099
we're so close to being happy.

26:28.069 --> 26:31.049
I never want you to blunt

26:28.069 --> 26:31.049
your ambition.

26:33.009 --> 26:36.230
It's one of the things

26:33.009 --> 26:36.230
that makes you... you.

26:39.049 --> 26:41.029
I got you back.

26:41.039 --> 26:42.250
That's my happy.

26:53.009 --> 26:54.259
- He's gonna come get me.

26:56.019 --> 26:57.150
- Maybe you should just relax.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.109
- Genies don't relax.

26:59.119 --> 27:01.269
Okay? I'd have to have my own

26:59.119 --> 27:01.269
needs and desires for that,

27:01.279 --> 27:05.059
rather than just

27:01.279 --> 27:05.059
fulfill wishes.

27:05.069 --> 27:06.220
- You killed people.

27:06.230 --> 27:08.109
- Doug killed people.

27:08.119 --> 27:10.279
I did my job.

27:08.119 --> 27:10.279
- Right.

27:10.289 --> 27:14.029
Genies don't kill people.

27:10.289 --> 27:14.029
People with genies kill people.

27:14.039 --> 27:15.029
- Facts.

27:15.039 --> 27:17.099
- Well, maybe don't pick

27:15.039 --> 27:17.099
an asshole next time.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.220
You saying I have

27:20.160 --> 27:22.220
bad taste in men?

27:24.109 --> 27:26.160
- I get the bad boy thing.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.160
(chuckling)

27:26.170 --> 27:28.039
- Doug?

27:28.049 --> 27:31.059
Ew. No, he's just my--

27:28.049 --> 27:31.059
- Bah!

27:31.069 --> 27:34.029
Uh... he's my

27:31.069 --> 27:34.029
"wish-getting guy."

27:34.039 --> 27:37.029
- Thank you.

27:34.039 --> 27:37.029
- It's not romantic.

27:38.109 --> 27:43.170
Even when they are cute,

27:38.109 --> 27:43.170
they're all Kuru in the end.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.039
- I'd retweet that.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.200
(Rachel): What's the capital

27:47.099 --> 27:48.200
of Tanzania?

27:48.210 --> 27:50.099
(Jeremy): Ah! Dodoma!

27:52.259 --> 27:54.170
- I could help with those

27:52.259 --> 27:54.170
butterflies

27:54.180 --> 27:57.019
if you just told me.

27:54.180 --> 27:57.019
- Never.

27:57.029 --> 28:00.029
Oh, my God, why am I here,

27:57.029 --> 28:00.029
why am I here?

28:00.039 --> 28:01.109
Why am I...

28:01.119 --> 28:04.069
- You're here because

28:01.119 --> 28:04.069
we want to decide

28:04.079 --> 28:06.210
who has Purgatory's

28:04.079 --> 28:06.210
tastiest brain.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.289
- Right, yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.069
- And so does the killer.

28:09.079 --> 28:13.059
And when he comes,

28:09.079 --> 28:13.059
we'll take him down.

28:14.220 --> 28:18.029
- Wow. Chicken-kicker

28:14.220 --> 28:18.029
shows her face.

28:18.039 --> 28:19.150
- What did you just call her?

28:19.160 --> 28:21.210
(clucking)

28:21.220 --> 28:24.240
(all clucking)

28:26.170 --> 28:28.240
- Alright, settle down.

28:29.130 --> 28:30.230
- Come on.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.130
- Start your brain engines,

28:30.240 --> 28:32.130
folks.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.140
Take your seats.

28:33.150 --> 28:35.230
- Nope. I am taking no seats.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.240
- Nicole! Wait!

28:36.250 --> 28:41.000
I mean... I can't go with you,

28:36.250 --> 28:41.000
but I love you!

28:42.240 --> 28:44.140
(Jeremy exhales)

28:45.269 --> 28:47.190
(whooshing)

28:47.200 --> 28:48.190
- Ow!

28:48.200 --> 28:50.140
Argh! Great. Kuru's wish

28:50.150 --> 28:53.130
means I literally

28:50.150 --> 28:53.130
can't leave trivia night.

28:53.140 --> 28:55.069
You've got to be kidding me.

28:58.019 --> 28:59.289
At least there's no Reaper

28:58.019 --> 28:59.289
anymore.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.190
(Nedley): Alright folks!

29:01.200 --> 29:04.230
Now, seeing as how

29:01.200 --> 29:04.230
this is sudden death,

29:04.240 --> 29:06.140
you buzz in with

29:04.240 --> 29:06.140
one wrong answer

29:06.150 --> 29:08.190
and that's all she wrote

29:06.150 --> 29:08.190
for you, you're done.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.180
You dig?

29:10.190 --> 29:12.099
Finalists?

29:12.109 --> 29:14.000
- You made it to the end?

29:14.009 --> 29:16.049
- Oh, I don't sleep, Earp.

29:14.009 --> 29:16.049
- Okay, remember guys,

29:16.059 --> 29:17.200
we're here

29:16.059 --> 29:17.200
to catch a killer.

29:17.210 --> 29:20.099
- After I best you

29:17.210 --> 29:20.099
at Pop Culture 101.

29:20.109 --> 29:21.250
- As if, Oldie Hawn.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.200
Also, I love you.

29:23.210 --> 29:25.170
(Nedley): Question number one.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.019
This famous songstress

29:27.029 --> 29:29.079
is the youngest of 14 siblings.

29:29.089 --> 29:31.200
(dinging)

29:29.089 --> 29:31.200
(all three): Celine!

29:31.210 --> 29:32.279
(Jeremy groaning)

29:32.289 --> 29:34.099
- Looks like a fun night

29:32.289 --> 29:34.099
ahead of us.

29:34.109 --> 29:36.000
That one's a draw.

29:34.109 --> 29:36.000
Question number two.

29:36.009 --> 29:37.150
(ding)

29:36.009 --> 29:37.150
- Turkmenistan!

29:37.160 --> 29:38.259
(ding)

29:37.160 --> 29:38.259
- Für Elise!

29:38.269 --> 29:42.009
(ding)

29:38.269 --> 29:42.009
- Kristy Yamaguchi!

29:42.019 --> 29:44.049
- Correct. Next question.

29:44.059 --> 29:46.009
- Ah! The archangel Gabriel.

29:46.019 --> 29:47.240
- Gah! That should've been mine!

29:47.250 --> 29:51.160
I'm the... one who read

29:47.250 --> 29:51.160
Paradise Lost.

29:51.170 --> 29:52.289
- Next question.

29:51.170 --> 29:52.289
- Dunkeroos!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.160
- Quaaludes!

29:54.170 --> 29:55.210
- Armie Hammer.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.210
- Correct.

29:56.220 --> 29:57.259
- Ooh! The planet Ork!

29:57.269 --> 29:59.250
- The Republic of Djibouti!

29:59.259 --> 30:03.130
- Justin, Joey, Chris,

29:59.259 --> 30:03.130
JC and Lance.

30:03.140 --> 30:07.009
(chuckling): Correct.

30:07.019 --> 30:08.160
- Boron!

30:07.019 --> 30:08.160
- No!

30:08.170 --> 30:10.059
I'm the science guy!

30:10.069 --> 30:11.259
- Jack Ruby.

30:11.269 --> 30:13.269
Oswald, he was a patsy.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.269
- You are correct.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.269
(dinging)

30:15.279 --> 30:17.160
Correct.

30:15.279 --> 30:17.160
(dinging)

30:17.170 --> 30:18.119
Correct.

30:17.170 --> 30:18.119
(ding)

30:18.130 --> 30:19.079
Correct.

30:19.089 --> 30:20.109
Correct.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.259
Correct.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.259
- Yes!

30:21.269 --> 30:23.049
(Jeremy sighs)

30:23.059 --> 30:25.049
- Okay, here's one

30:23.059 --> 30:25.049
for the cowboys.

30:25.059 --> 30:27.089
Now known as

30:25.059 --> 30:27.089
the "dead man's hand,"

30:27.099 --> 30:30.049
what combination of cards

30:27.099 --> 30:30.049
was Wild Bill Hickock holding

30:30.059 --> 30:32.049
when he was shot in the back?

30:30.059 --> 30:32.049
- Ugh!

30:32.059 --> 30:34.049
(ding)

30:32.059 --> 30:34.049
Mr. Holliday.

30:34.059 --> 30:36.059
- William had himself

30:34.059 --> 30:36.059
a deuce and a seven,

30:36.069 --> 30:38.269
which is a death

30:36.069 --> 30:38.269
unto itself.

30:38.279 --> 30:40.220
- Dead man's hand is a pair

30:38.279 --> 30:40.220
of aces and eights.

30:40.230 --> 30:43.069
- Uh, yeah, that is not

30:40.230 --> 30:43.069
what he had.

30:43.079 --> 30:45.210
I was there.

30:43.079 --> 30:45.210
(Jeremy scoffs)

30:45.220 --> 30:47.059
- Did he just say he was there?

30:47.069 --> 30:50.079
- Yeah, wow, you really need

30:47.069 --> 30:50.079
another mint, Bradley.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.009
- Sorry Doc, but you're out.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.259
- This is an outrage,

30:54.269 --> 30:56.220
I must remain in this battle

30:54.269 --> 30:56.220
and prove that

30:56.230 --> 30:59.099
it is I that has

30:56.230 --> 30:59.099
the ideal brain.

31:00.019 --> 31:02.079
Wait. Why is it still just us?

31:02.089 --> 31:03.289
Where is the man

31:02.089 --> 31:03.289
that calls himself Kuru?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.140
- Boo! Down in front!

31:06.150 --> 31:08.039
Boo!

31:06.150 --> 31:08.039
- Move it along.

31:08.049 --> 31:09.079
- You're still my favourite,

31:08.049 --> 31:09.079
boo.

31:09.089 --> 31:13.049
- Okay, wait. So, now,

31:09.089 --> 31:13.049
he's the vampire demon leader?

31:13.059 --> 31:15.089
- I know, it's messed up.

31:15.099 --> 31:16.230
(chuckling)

31:16.240 --> 31:19.289
- Well, I can tell you,

31:16.240 --> 31:19.289
love messed up.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.269
At least I know my keeper.

31:21.279 --> 31:24.140
- Hey. Stop saying that word!

31:21.279 --> 31:24.140
- Why?

31:24.150 --> 31:26.089
- Because it's got

31:24.150 --> 31:26.089
horrible connotations.

31:26.099 --> 31:29.130
- That's the reality

31:26.099 --> 31:29.130
for some of us.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.000
Both of us.

31:31.009 --> 31:33.009
- I still have the gun

31:31.009 --> 31:33.009
that can kill you.

31:33.019 --> 31:36.089
- Or does it have you, honey?

31:33.019 --> 31:36.089
(chuckling)

31:36.099 --> 31:38.089
(ringtone, Ginny gasps)

31:38.099 --> 31:44.190
Okay, please. Can I just quickly

31:38.099 --> 31:44.190
just peek at my notifications?

31:44.200 --> 31:45.180
Please?

31:45.190 --> 31:47.069
Please.

31:47.079 --> 31:50.049
- Just don't text Doug.

31:50.059 --> 31:51.240
Ghost him till he dies.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.079
- I'm worse than a ghost.

31:53.230 --> 31:56.000
- Ugh.

31:53.230 --> 31:56.000
(Ginny sighs)

31:56.009 --> 31:59.130
Ugh... he wished he could

31:56.009 --> 31:59.130
walk through walls.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.190
- I wish Wynonna would open

31:59.140 --> 32:01.190
the cell.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.220
(whooshing, Wynonna moans)

32:07.160 --> 32:10.000
(clanging)

32:10.009 --> 32:11.210
- Why aren't you

32:10.009 --> 32:11.210
at trivia night?

32:12.240 --> 32:15.170
- Back at the house,

32:12.240 --> 32:15.170
I realized...

32:15.180 --> 32:17.009
street brains.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.210
- You mean street smarts?

32:20.250 --> 32:22.079
(snorting)

32:22.089 --> 32:26.069
- Street brains

32:22.089 --> 32:26.069
are brains that I want too.

32:27.059 --> 32:30.230
That's what you have. So, you.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.059
- Ugh.

32:34.069 --> 32:36.220
- I wish for her to say

32:34.069 --> 32:36.220
bye-bye to her brain.

32:37.190 --> 32:39.069
(whooshing)

32:40.220 --> 32:42.119
- Bye-bye, brain.

32:47.079 --> 32:48.210
which means he's heading

32:47.079 --> 32:48.210
for his genie,

32:48.220 --> 32:49.210
putting Wynonna in danger.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.250
- Yes, okay, yeah, you're right.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.250
You're right!

32:51.259 --> 32:53.200
- Yeah. We have to help her.

32:51.259 --> 32:53.200
(Nedley): Alright,

32:53.210 --> 32:54.220
we've done the final

32:53.210 --> 32:54.220
calculations,

32:54.230 --> 32:55.289
and it turns out it's a dead tie

32:56.000 --> 32:59.190
between Waverly Earp

32:56.000 --> 32:59.190
and Jeremy Chetri.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.269
Come on up here for

32:59.200 --> 33:01.269
a sudden-death playoff round.

33:01.279 --> 33:04.130
(Jeremy, panting): I am

33:01.279 --> 33:04.130
so sorry, Doc, I can't help it!

33:04.140 --> 33:05.230
- Neither can I.

33:05.240 --> 33:08.140
- If I have to do this alone

33:05.240 --> 33:08.140
then I will!

33:08.150 --> 33:09.150
- One question at a time,

33:09.160 --> 33:11.000
five seconds to answer.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.000
- Okay.

33:11.150 --> 33:13.200
(whooshing)

33:14.130 --> 33:17.150
- Dammit.

33:14.130 --> 33:17.150
I simply cannot miss trivia.

33:17.160 --> 33:20.150
Literally. We cannot waste

33:17.160 --> 33:20.150
another moment.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.009
One of you must lose,

33:20.160 --> 33:22.009
and posthaste.

33:22.019 --> 33:25.220
- Well, she's your sister!

33:22.019 --> 33:25.220
- Uh! You're found family!

33:25.230 --> 33:27.170
You chose her. You lose.

33:27.180 --> 33:28.279
- Snap out of it!

33:28.289 --> 33:30.180
(all): We can't!

33:31.099 --> 33:33.059
- If we have no other choice.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.049
- I wish she would lie

33:34.160 --> 33:36.049
on the gurney.

33:36.059 --> 33:37.259
(whooshing)

33:39.190 --> 33:41.250
(Wynonna grunts and pants)

33:41.259 --> 33:43.009
(Kuru chuckling, coughing)

33:43.019 --> 33:45.039
(Ginny): I guess I know

33:43.019 --> 33:45.039
what's next.

33:45.049 --> 33:49.190
- What's that?

33:45.049 --> 33:49.190
- You get me to finish the job.

33:50.170 --> 33:51.269
Mm-hmm.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.250
- Fine!

33:57.099 --> 33:59.099
I wish for a knife.

33:57.099 --> 33:59.099
(Wynonna): Doug.

33:59.109 --> 34:00.230
- Kuru!

34:00.240 --> 34:03.190
I am the demon Kuru.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.230
I will be removing this brain...

34:06.240 --> 34:08.280
(Wynonna whimpering)

34:06.240 --> 34:08.280
...myself.

34:08.289 --> 34:10.260
(sinister music)

34:11.170 --> 34:13.170
- Doc! Hey, what's going

34:11.170 --> 34:13.170
on up there?

34:13.179 --> 34:15.219
- Jeremy and Waverly

34:13.179 --> 34:15.219
are caught in a stalemate.

34:15.230 --> 34:17.289
And I believe Wynonna

34:15.230 --> 34:17.289
to be in grave danger.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.170
- So I take it you're stuck

34:18.000 --> 34:19.170
here too?

34:19.179 --> 34:22.030
- Well, I suppose we all are

34:19.179 --> 34:22.030
until trivia ends,

34:22.039 --> 34:24.170
when one of them

34:22.039 --> 34:24.170
answers incorrectly.

34:24.179 --> 34:25.289
- Or doesn't answer at all.

34:28.179 --> 34:30.099
We'll need a distraction.

34:32.219 --> 34:34.090
We need Chicken-kicker.

34:36.119 --> 34:38.000
- Okay. Next question.

34:38.010 --> 34:40.239
According to Greek mythology...

34:38.010 --> 34:40.239
- Hey. Phone. Now.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.289
- Oh, please don't check

34:40.250 --> 34:42.289
my browser history.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.110
- Okay, we'll talk

34:43.000 --> 34:45.110
about that later.

34:45.119 --> 34:47.230
Rachel, I need the video.

34:45.119 --> 34:47.230
- What video?

34:47.239 --> 34:50.110
- The video. Chicken-kicker.

34:50.119 --> 34:52.059
- I deleted it.

34:50.119 --> 34:52.059
I respect the ban.

34:52.070 --> 34:54.199
- No one in their right mind

34:52.070 --> 34:54.199
would delete that video.

34:56.059 --> 34:58.050
- It's in a folder marked

34:56.059 --> 34:58.050
"Tax Stuff."

34:59.130 --> 35:00.280
- Clever girl.

35:00.289 --> 35:04.059
Okay, I just need to find

35:00.289 --> 35:04.059
the Bluetooth.

35:04.070 --> 35:05.130
(Nedley): Waverly Earp.

35:05.139 --> 35:09.280
A tribe in Papua New Guinea

35:05.139 --> 35:09.280
is affected by this condition

35:09.289 --> 35:12.179
when eating brain.

35:09.289 --> 35:12.179
- Oh!

35:12.190 --> 35:14.269
- Goodbye, self-respect.

35:15.170 --> 35:17.030
(Nicole in video): Hello.

35:17.039 --> 35:21.030
You losers didn't vote for me

35:17.039 --> 35:21.030
for Sheriff,

35:21.039 --> 35:22.000
but I stayed!

35:22.010 --> 35:25.039
(slurring): I'm the one

35:22.010 --> 35:25.039
who stayed!

35:25.050 --> 35:29.099
And now you just wanna stuff

35:25.050 --> 35:29.099
your dumb faces

35:29.110 --> 35:30.110
while celebrating Holt?!

35:30.119 --> 35:31.239
- Waverly, do you have

35:30.119 --> 35:31.239
an answer?

35:31.250 --> 35:36.119
- Well, fuck your votes,

35:31.250 --> 35:36.119
fuck your dinner!

35:36.130 --> 35:39.019
And fuck this chicken!

35:39.030 --> 35:41.179
(screaming)

35:39.030 --> 35:41.179
(bar patrons laughing)

35:41.190 --> 35:42.210
(Nedley): Your chance to win

35:41.190 --> 35:42.210
the tournament.

35:42.219 --> 35:44.179
- Kuru!

35:44.190 --> 35:45.289
Kuru!

35:46.000 --> 35:47.289
(Nedley): Yes! Jeremy Chetri,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.090
you have the biggest,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.090
tastiest brain in Purgatory!

35:51.099 --> 35:52.190
- Yeah!

35:52.199 --> 35:54.099
(magical chiming)

35:57.289 --> 35:59.010
What?

35:59.019 --> 36:01.130
- I'm sorry, I'm sure

35:59.019 --> 36:01.130
your brain tastes terrible.

36:03.150 --> 36:05.019
- Praise be.

36:06.010 --> 36:08.130
- Ginny! Ginny,

36:06.010 --> 36:08.130
get Peacemaker! Help!

36:08.139 --> 36:09.199
- I can't do shit.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.130
(screaming)

36:11.139 --> 36:13.030
(Kuru moaning)

36:11.139 --> 36:13.030
Help!

36:13.039 --> 36:14.269
- And I need a more

36:13.039 --> 36:14.269
Zen atmosphere.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.130
- I wish for her

36:14.280 --> 36:16.130
to stop screaming.

36:16.139 --> 36:17.250
(sceaming stops)

36:19.099 --> 36:20.289
(exhaling)

36:21.000 --> 36:22.150
You know, I don't feel so good.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.199
I wish for a bigger knife.

36:24.210 --> 36:26.110
- Sure, that's

36:24.210 --> 36:26.110
what's stopping you.

36:26.119 --> 36:28.050
- I am Kuru!

36:28.059 --> 36:30.199
I am Kuru,

36:28.059 --> 36:30.199
and I can be strong too.

36:30.210 --> 36:31.210
(whimpering)

36:31.219 --> 36:33.099
I can be st...

36:31.219 --> 36:33.099
(gagging)

36:33.110 --> 36:34.210
(gagging)

36:34.219 --> 36:36.280
- Okay. Just come to me

36:34.219 --> 36:36.280
and I'll take care of it.

36:36.289 --> 36:38.280
- I need street brains.

36:39.119 --> 36:40.170
I wish...

36:41.099 --> 36:44.000
- I tried Wynonna,

36:41.099 --> 36:44.000
but it is what it is.

36:44.239 --> 36:46.250
(thudding)

36:48.230 --> 36:51.250
- Whoa! What the hell! Ah!

36:48.230 --> 36:51.250
(breathing heavily)

36:51.260 --> 36:53.000
- He's dead, Wynonna.

36:53.010 --> 36:57.079
- Were you gonna let him cut me?

36:53.010 --> 36:57.079
- Uh, I was killing time.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.010
His cannibal brain's been

36:57.090 --> 36:59.010
rotting for weeks.

36:59.019 --> 37:01.260
It was obv he was

36:59.019 --> 37:01.260
about to kick it, so...

37:03.150 --> 37:05.230
- Sup, Doc. Where ya been?

37:05.239 --> 37:07.070
- You alright?

37:07.079 --> 37:09.050
- It's all Kuru, baby.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.159
So, who had the tastiest brain?

37:11.170 --> 37:13.039
- So this is yours?

37:14.079 --> 37:16.130
Hey... I'm Ginny.

37:26.230 --> 37:28.130
- I'm good.

37:26.230 --> 37:28.130
- Nah, seriously,

37:28.139 --> 37:30.239
you should try it on.

37:28.139 --> 37:30.239
- Nah.

37:30.250 --> 37:33.090
- I don't have to sit here

37:30.250 --> 37:33.090
if you don't want me to.

37:33.099 --> 37:34.199
- And miss my opportunity

37:34.210 --> 37:36.239
to speak with

37:34.210 --> 37:36.239
the Chicken-kicker herself?

37:36.250 --> 37:38.119
(laughing): Okay, well,

37:38.130 --> 37:40.230
anything that you want to know

37:38.130 --> 37:40.230
on chicken kicking,

37:40.239 --> 37:42.219
I will happily oblige.

37:43.260 --> 37:46.119
But I know there's something

37:43.260 --> 37:46.119
else you'd rather hear about.

37:46.130 --> 37:49.070
- You were gonna trade me

37:46.130 --> 37:49.070
to the Clantons?

37:49.079 --> 37:51.190
- Look.

37:49.079 --> 37:51.190
There's no excuse, okay?

37:51.199 --> 37:54.150
But... I had reasons.

37:55.090 --> 37:56.179
It brought Waverly home to me.

37:56.190 --> 37:59.039
- I was a part of that too.

37:56.190 --> 37:59.039
- I know.

38:00.099 --> 38:02.219
I will be forever grateful.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.280
Doc, I'm sorry,

38:04.199 --> 38:06.280
but I had to be sure.

38:07.130 --> 38:08.250
- What did they even

38:07.130 --> 38:08.250
want with me?

38:08.260 --> 38:10.150
- No clue.

38:10.159 --> 38:13.039
But I knew that whatever

38:10.159 --> 38:13.039
it was,

38:13.050 --> 38:14.210
that you could handle it.

38:14.219 --> 38:18.119
And if you didn't, then

38:14.219 --> 38:18.119
we were gonna figure it out.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.219
Together.

38:20.079 --> 38:21.190
'Cause I'd fight

38:20.079 --> 38:21.190
for you too, Doc.

38:23.199 --> 38:25.260
- I appreciate that,

38:23.199 --> 38:25.260
Sheriff Haught.

38:26.269 --> 38:29.139
- You know you're the only one

38:26.269 --> 38:29.139
who still calls me that, right?

38:29.150 --> 38:32.150
- The badge alone does not

38:29.150 --> 38:32.150
give the authority.

38:33.150 --> 38:36.199
- Yeah. Tell that to the people

38:33.150 --> 38:36.199
who saw me kick a chicken.

38:36.210 --> 38:40.070
(Nicole in video): Chicken!

38:36.210 --> 38:40.070
(screaming)

38:40.079 --> 38:41.190
- Why don't you tell them?

38:53.039 --> 38:54.190
- Hey everybody, listen up!

38:55.250 --> 38:57.099
(video recording beeps)

38:57.110 --> 38:59.260
Yeah. You getting this? Good.

39:00.269 --> 39:02.159
Show of hands here:

39:03.260 --> 39:05.159
who voted for me?

39:09.260 --> 39:12.110
Well, I don't care.

39:09.260 --> 39:12.110
I'm not embarrassed about it.

39:12.119 --> 39:15.010
We all do things

39:12.119 --> 39:15.010
we regret, right?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.230
So yeah, okay.

39:16.239 --> 39:19.030
I am Chicken-kicker.

39:19.039 --> 39:20.210
- Yeah, ya are!

39:19.039 --> 39:20.210
(chuckling)

39:20.219 --> 39:22.099
- But I'm still gonna be

39:20.219 --> 39:22.099
your sheriff.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.199
'Cause I made a promise.

39:24.210 --> 39:28.099
I made a promise

39:24.210 --> 39:28.099
to serve and protect

39:28.110 --> 39:31.070
every single person

39:28.110 --> 39:31.070
in this town.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.039
Even those that break the law.

39:34.289 --> 39:38.139
Or slice their grilled cheese

39:34.289 --> 39:38.139
sandwich lengthwise instead

39:38.150 --> 39:41.260
of diagonally, which...

39:38.150 --> 39:41.260
I've never understood.

39:41.269 --> 39:44.199
Or don't like me...

39:45.260 --> 39:47.179
because I'm an outsider.

39:48.289 --> 39:50.099
Because I'm gay.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.210
- I don't care that she's gay!

39:53.219 --> 39:56.219
- Even those who literally

39:53.219 --> 39:56.219
ate feces.

39:58.050 --> 40:00.070
- You eat shit one time

39:58.050 --> 40:00.070
and it's...

40:00.079 --> 40:02.159
- It's kinda like kicking

40:00.079 --> 40:02.159
a chicken.

40:02.170 --> 40:03.090
One time.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.289
You know, folks,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.289
we've all made mistakes.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.130
And it usually happens with

40:10.000 --> 40:13.130
things we care about the most.

40:16.059 --> 40:19.219
- We do need you,

40:16.059 --> 40:19.219
Sheriff Haught.

40:22.159 --> 40:25.119
- Revote's unanimous.

40:22.159 --> 40:25.119
You're reinstated.

40:25.130 --> 40:28.130
(cheering and applause)

40:32.210 --> 40:34.030
- Oh, my god.

40:34.039 --> 40:36.289
I finally get

40:34.039 --> 40:36.289
Wynonna's bad boy thing.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.190
Chicken-kicker is hot.

40:38.199 --> 40:40.239
(giggling)

40:45.139 --> 40:47.190
(twinkling ringtone)

40:54.280 --> 40:57.280
- Here to be my matriarch?

40:57.289 --> 40:59.139
- No.

41:02.289 --> 41:04.079
- But we got him.

41:04.090 --> 41:06.139
The disease got him.

41:04.090 --> 41:06.139
- Did it?

41:06.150 --> 41:09.289
Or do all your... masters...

41:06.150 --> 41:09.289
- Careful.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.099
- ...die like that?

41:11.110 --> 41:14.139
Diseased and full of rot.

41:11.110 --> 41:14.139
- Doug was sick.

41:14.150 --> 41:16.010
Dude ate brain.

41:16.019 --> 41:17.199
- See, what I think,

41:18.150 --> 41:20.150
having a genie,

41:20.159 --> 41:23.139
all that choice,

41:20.159 --> 41:23.139
it makes them insane.

41:23.150 --> 41:27.170
And then you get to kill

41:23.150 --> 41:27.170
for them. You like it.

41:27.179 --> 41:30.010
- Well, I was just doing

41:27.179 --> 41:30.010
what I have to do.

41:30.019 --> 41:31.289
I'm the victim.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.139
You said so yourself.

41:33.150 --> 41:36.019
- You may be a genie,

41:33.150 --> 41:36.019
but you are still a demon.

41:36.030 --> 41:37.139
He was just some idiot.

41:37.150 --> 41:39.150
And you'll find another one.

41:40.199 --> 41:42.090
You're too powerful a weapon.

41:42.099 --> 41:45.210
I realized it when you got Doug

41:42.099 --> 41:45.210
to wish for me to be quiet.

41:45.219 --> 41:47.150
- I couldn't listen

41:45.219 --> 41:47.150
to you cry for help

41:47.159 --> 41:48.260
when I couldn't help you!

41:48.269 --> 41:51.000
- You gotta listen

41:48.269 --> 41:51.000
to the screams.

41:51.010 --> 41:54.019
You have to look the cost

41:51.010 --> 41:54.019
of this in the eye

41:54.030 --> 41:56.110
and tell it to go fuck itself.

42:00.099 --> 42:01.199
- Okay.

42:03.090 --> 42:05.000
You want a new choice?

42:09.039 --> 42:11.000
Have all the choices you want.

42:11.010 --> 42:12.110
- I've already had a curse.

42:12.119 --> 42:13.190
- I can stop what's coming.

42:13.199 --> 42:15.139
- I can stop what's coming.

42:15.150 --> 42:17.110
- I could make him

42:15.150 --> 42:17.110
love you again.

42:22.269 --> 42:24.210
- Hmm.

42:24.219 --> 42:26.219
(whirring)

42:29.150 --> 42:31.030
- Make Doc choke it down.

42:31.039 --> 42:33.010
- I get it.

42:33.280 --> 42:35.090
I'm poison too.

42:35.099 --> 42:38.079
- With a psychotic gun

42:35.099 --> 42:38.079
for a master.

42:38.090 --> 42:39.159
We're the same.

42:39.170 --> 42:41.130
- The difference is that...

42:42.269 --> 42:44.039
you have a way out.

42:44.050 --> 42:46.039
- No, you don't have to.

42:46.050 --> 42:47.110
- Genie.

42:47.119 --> 42:51.199
(gunshot, screeching)

42:53.280 --> 42:55.039
You're free.
