09:44.167 --> 09:46.169
A smart woman makes any man
look smarter and stable.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.880
Just like you do for me,
ravishing princess.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.507
I gotta get in the Dome.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.426
My master class
is about to begin.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.849
[newscaster] Yesterday,
in a surprise verdict,

09:59.016 --> 10:01.101
former football star
OJ Simpson

10:01.268 --> 10:03.478
was found not guilty of murder

10:03.645 --> 10:07.190
in the case of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ron Goldman.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.693
With more on the story,
we're going to Tim Felix.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.528
[Tim] That's right,
I'm here now...

10:11.695 --> 10:12.904
Howdy.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.948
Tom Spade to see Mr. Turner.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.700
Yes, Mr. Spade, welcome.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.577
I'll let Mr. Turner
know you're here.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.874
[Joe] There he is.
Looking sharp, Tom.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.751
Joe, I can't thank you
and Eric enough

10:25.917 --> 10:27.753
for your belief in me
in this introduction.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.713
You're a heck of a wrestler,
Tom--easy to do.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.382
-Morning, Delores.
-Morning, Mr. Canniff.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.676
Your boy OJ
had a lucky day, eh?

10:34.843 --> 10:37.429
Oh, he's not my boy,
Mr. Canniff.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.806
Ted is gonna love you.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.683
Ted is just very invested
in the talent

10:41.808 --> 10:43.560
that represents his name
and his networks.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.395
Don't BS him.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.064
He's sincere. Real.
Confident.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.732
And that's why he's gonna like
you.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.734
Just be yourself.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.819
I'm off to Houston.
I'll call you tonight.

10:54.529 --> 10:55.739
[phone rings]

10:57.908 --> 10:59.785
[Delores] Ted Turner's office.
Can I help you?

11:01.536 --> 11:02.746
Hi.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.673
Meeting's still going.
That's a good sign.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.467
[Wild Bill] One would think.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.889
So how long till
we're on WCW Nitro?

11:21.056 --> 11:23.642
Not in our control.
In due time.

11:23.809 --> 11:26.103
How do I let 'em know I don't
wanna just be your valet?

11:26.228 --> 11:28.271
By being the best
valet you can be.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.524
Boo. Bad answer.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.734
We just gotta make each
spot in our matches shine.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.820
Word will get around
that you wanna wrestle.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.447
We just gotta work hard
and do whatever they ask

11:37.614 --> 11:39.282
before we ask for what we want.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.784
But we still got to speak up.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.953
We speak up by making
ourselves indispensable.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.788
With no drama.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.623
That's no way to
get ahead fast.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.250
You watch how soon
we climb the ladder

11:48.375 --> 11:49.876
not by asking for anything

11:50.001 --> 11:51.920
but by being hard-workin'
and reliable.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.506
[Willie laughs]

11:58.927 --> 12:00.512
Mr. Turner begs your pardon,

12:00.637 --> 12:02.472
but he'll be just
a few more minutes.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.813
[Willie] What the hell could
they still be talking about?

12:09.938 --> 12:11.189
Yachts.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.816
I'm gonna get some more smokes.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.819
Uh...you got any dough?
I'm skint.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.365
I'll get some snacks too.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.159
More than beef jerky this time!

12:22.325 --> 12:23.618
[Wild Bill] Will do, milady.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.954
Even pay you back with
interest, once we make it.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.415
[laughs] Splurge.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.001
More time Tom's schmoozing Ted,
more rich we're gonna be.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.004
Don't bank that cash yet.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.839
Money changes people.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.924
Especially
'fore the money comes.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.051
For all we know, Tom's up there
cutting us out.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.137
He would never do that.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.140
Judas betrayed the Son of
God for 30 pieces of silver.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.476
Ted Turner's got
a Fort Knox of silver.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.144
[Willie laughs]

12:54.191 --> 12:55.817
[door opens]

12:57.861 --> 12:59.529
I beg your pardon, Mr. Spade,

12:59.696 --> 13:01.448
but Mr. Turner
needs to reschedule.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.949
How come?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.118
I'm not always aware of
the reasons, Mr. Spade.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.871
But I'll reach out this week
to find something convenient.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.372
Well, today was convenient.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.875
I have my own obligations
I put aside.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.044
-I understand.
-Not sure you do.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.712
I'd like to just pop in
and say hello.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.881
He's not there, Mr. Spade.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.424
Now you're just
messin' with me.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.301
I been sittin' here
this whole time, eyes open.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.511
I did not see him leave.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.346
He has a separate entrance.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.723
Now, I'll reach out
later this week,

13:26.890 --> 13:28.683
when I know
the rest of his schedule.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.895
Please do.
I have a schedule too.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.858
[knock on door]

13:37.025 --> 13:39.819
Jack, uh, Mr. Rizzo
has arrived.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.905
[Jack] Thank you, Debbie.
Brooks, welcome.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.115
Jack, good to see you again.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.327
It was a bit of a chaotic
introduction backstage

13:47.452 --> 13:48.912
down there at Dystopia.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.956
We have to keep our heads
down and the kayfabe up.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.666
That's my brother Ace.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.752
Wow. That was really
something last night.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.671
-Pleasure to meet you, Ace.
-[Ace] Thank you so much.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.589
Sorry I couldn't
stay at the show.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.633
I had to duck out
and hide in Jack's car.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.468
It's all good.
I get it.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.637
We appreciate you comin'
to see us here in person.

14:05.804 --> 14:06.846
We know Duffy's out the way.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.348
[Ace] Of everything.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.767
I like the drive here,
all the winding roads,

14:10.934 --> 14:13.270
and then, uh, pulling up on
the water tower, the neon sign.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.854
You got a lotta character
in this town.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.064
We grew up here.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.400
-Our dad...
-God rest his soul.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.110
bought this place
three decades ago.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.487
[Ace] He died last year.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.780
He saw potential.
May I get you some coffee?

14:24.948 --> 14:26.199
Sure. Thank you.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.159
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.121
Brooks, this is
the lovely Staci Spade,

14:31.288 --> 14:32.872
who thankfully
spilled a beer on me

14:32.998 --> 14:35.041
at a Georgia/Florida football
tailgate 10 1/2 years ago.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.002
[Staci]
Yeah. Being clumsy paid off.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.504
I got this handsome piece of
meat called Jack out of it.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.839
Pleased to meet you.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.133
-Mrs. Spade.
-No, please, call me Staci.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.301
W-we're so appreciative
you're taking time

14:44.467 --> 14:45.468
to get to know more about us.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.804
There you are.
Maybe sit.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.348
-Got you right here.
-Oh, yeah.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.142
Uh, as I was telling Jack
on the phone,

14:52.267 --> 14:53.810
our streaming
platform Continuum

14:53.977 --> 14:55.979
is looking to add
a sporting element

14:56.146 --> 14:57.772
to our programming portfolio.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.567
-I wish I knew what that meant.
-[laughter]

15:00.734 --> 15:03.653
It means that we're
a fledgling streaming service

15:03.820 --> 15:05.447
that just got
a big round of funding.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.990
So now we're being
considered for a merger

15:07.157 --> 15:08.658
with an even-bigger
streaming service,

15:08.825 --> 15:10.827
if we can exponentially
grow our subscriber base.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.871
And professional wrestling,
I'm learning,

15:12.996 --> 15:14.164
is very big business.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.665
Very.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.917
We wanna build something
from the ground up.

15:21.171 --> 15:24.174
So maybe you can all
tell me what you're about.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.009
Let's start at the beginning.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.385
The first time
I went off the top rope

15:27.552 --> 15:29.679
-was the day I turned two.
-[laughter]

15:29.846 --> 15:31.598
[Wild Bill] All righty!

15:31.765 --> 15:34.684
I'm instituting a lecture
series here at the DWL.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.020
So open your minds,
shut your mouths,

15:37.145 --> 15:39.314
and take your fuckin' seats.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.191
-[laughter]
-[Debbie] Wow.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.029
The elephant in the room
is not an elephant.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.365
On these very premises,

15:48.530 --> 15:50.408
there is a man
from an entertainment entity

15:50.533 --> 15:52.786
interested in the DWL.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.039
When he leaves, we will learn
how piqued his interest is

15:56.206 --> 15:58.958
and what it might mean
for our future.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.919
Part of what it means

16:01.044 --> 16:04.005
is validation for what
we've accomplished.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.049
We have drawn attention
to Duffy.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.217
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

16:07.384 --> 16:09.636
-[Debbie] All right!
-[Diego] Yeah.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.054
But that's done.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.264
It's in the past.

16:13.431 --> 16:16.685
Right now, every one of us
needs to be thinking,

16:16.851 --> 16:20.772
"What can I do to make our
visitor's interest pay off?"

16:22.816 --> 16:24.192
We all have one thing
in common.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.569
One day we showed up here
with a version of...

16:26.736 --> 16:28.905
-knock-knock. I wanna wrestle.
-[light laughter]

16:29.030 --> 16:32.283
Each of us surmised
we had something

16:32.409 --> 16:34.828
other people might marvel at.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.747
Which is a little presumptuous.
And a little insane.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.375
Truth is,
no one needs what we do.

16:40.542 --> 16:44.254
We are the very definition of
a nonessential industry,

16:44.421 --> 16:46.631
one we've invited ourselves
into.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.466
You gotta ask yourself,

16:48.633 --> 16:51.803
"Do I have what it takes?"

16:51.970 --> 16:55.515
Some might say,
"Yes, Bill. I worked hard.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.934
I paid my dues."

16:58.101 --> 16:59.352
Don't.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.480
Entitlement is a sin.

17:03.772 --> 17:07.944
"Hard work pays off" is one
of the biggest lies in life.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.697
Hard work is just hard work.
Will it pay off?

17:10.864 --> 17:12.949
Shit, flip a coin.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.617
This business
is littered with folks

17:14.784 --> 17:17.620
who worked their ass off,
got jack shit to show for it.

17:19.456 --> 17:23.543
We better be askin'
"How can we be exceptional?"

17:23.710 --> 17:27.338
I am lookin' for keepers
of the flame here, folks.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.340
Come up with something great.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.675
Go back through history.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.219
Elizabethan drama,
commedia dell'arte--

17:33.386 --> 17:36.639
the average storytelling mode
lasts a generation

17:36.765 --> 17:39.058
before it becomes too familiar,
too trite.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.644
The vessel no longer
serves as a conduit

17:41.770 --> 17:44.397
for a vital
and heartbreaking narrative

17:44.522 --> 17:47.192
on which the human soul
thrives.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.861
It becomes dismissible.

17:50.028 --> 17:53.865
That is where
we are with wrestling...

17:53.990 --> 17:56.242
at the tail fucking end.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.579
About to become dismissible,
a useless vessel.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.039
Let me state again:

18:01.206 --> 18:03.374
no one is asking us
to wrestle.

18:03.541 --> 18:07.504
Our risk of life and limb
is our choice.

18:07.670 --> 18:13.051
So what promise will we make to
ourselves to make it worth it?

18:13.176 --> 18:14.761
[soft, stirring music]

18:14.886 --> 18:16.846
Pick up a pen and a notebook
and start writing down

18:17.013 --> 18:18.389
what you want
from this endeavor

18:18.515 --> 18:20.809
and what you are
willing to do to get it.

18:20.934 --> 18:26.606
Only then can we start
working on our goals together.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.650
Freedom!

18:28.817 --> 18:31.277
-[all whooping]
-Freedom!

18:33.029 --> 18:35.448
[Gully] All right, Rooster.
Make this one count.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.408
-Action.
-[Rooster] All I keep

18:37.534 --> 18:39.869
hearing about is The Condamned.

18:41.913 --> 18:46.417
See, as long as I got
this belt...

18:46.584 --> 18:48.711
the only name that should be
coming out your mouth

18:48.878 --> 18:50.547
is Rooster Robbins!

18:53.508 --> 18:56.427
But it's cool.
Ha ha ha. I get it.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.222
The Condamned, he cool.
And it's like he ziplined

18:59.389 --> 19:01.224
right out the pages
of a comic book.

19:01.391 --> 19:05.061
Flying around the arena
like he's Superman.

19:05.186 --> 19:08.231
Ha ha ha ha!
Whooping on a group of ten men.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.651
So I'm callin' out
The Condamned.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.570
I'm callin' out Jack Spade.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.739
I'm callin' out all of
my so-called friends

19:16.906 --> 19:20.577
that didn't have my back
when I was in the DWL.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.537
And when we meet...oh, yeah,

19:22.704 --> 19:26.416
when we meet, I want the hero
that y'all chose over me.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.251
Yeah. I want The Condamned!

19:28.418 --> 19:30.920
I want him in a last man
