WEBVTT

01:44.720 --> 01:46.520
He spoke a lot about you.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.240
All the time, as a matter of fact.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.960
Do you have family?

02:00.560 --> 02:02.000
I do.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.720
Three kids and a wife.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.360
Probably not recognise me anymore.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.280
Why don't you just go home?

02:14.360 --> 02:16.560
I'm no longer the
person they think I am.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.560
At least you're alive.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.840
Is that Seymour?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.800
What happened?

03:19.800 --> 03:23.160
It's Seymour, he's lost his damn mind.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.240
He left for the Lady's house.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.280
What he do?

03:26.280 --> 03:28.400
He tried to light the
whole damn town on fire.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.640
Sarah stopped him.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.800
Is she all right?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.280
She's back at the house.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.080
We won today, back in Elmdale.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.760
Elizabeth Thurmann's
attempt to pervert the law

03:51.760 --> 03:53.160
and steal our home has failed.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.640
Yeah!

03:56.440 --> 03:58.520
Now, I thought this
would be the end of it.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.880
What happened here tonight is
proof that this is far from over.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.720
That it's only a matter of time...

04:08.680 --> 04:10.200
...till they come at us again.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.240
By then, we will be ready to fight!

04:14.240 --> 04:16.280
Yeah!

04:41.360 --> 04:42.600
Maggie!

04:53.080 --> 04:54.640
Sarah!

04:54.640 --> 04:56.160
Sammy!

04:56.160 --> 04:58.120
Timmy!

04:59.120 --> 05:00.960
Where is everyone?

06:05.040 --> 06:09.360
They knew this had been a
recruiting area for the Confederates,

06:10.360 --> 06:16.000
so they let their victorious troops
help themselves to the war booty.

06:16.560 --> 06:21.280
Murders, rapes, looting.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.040
I think the Indians did it.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.320
They were taken as
guides by both the armies.

06:28.760 --> 06:34.240
And now that the war is over,
they're doing incursions everywhere.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.720
It's not uncommon.

06:40.560 --> 06:44.320
When I heard what was going
on, I went immediately.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.600
All I found were graves.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.080
Where's my family, Father?

06:54.200 --> 06:55.760
Let it go, Julian.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.240
Thank you, Father.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.560
I don't have a guiding path
to offer, but remember...

07:17.040 --> 07:19.960
...all this is the result of hate.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.360
Don't let hate dictate your decisions.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.080
I thought I'd never see you again.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.160
You know I'd never leave you alone.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.160
Things might have gone different
if Django hadn't been there.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.880
And what about you?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.480
Are you all right?

08:37.120 --> 08:38.720
Seymour needs help.

08:40.560 --> 08:44.520
He almost burned down this whole
city. He could've killed you.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.000
No, never.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.040
Why are you defending him?

08:51.040 --> 08:54.200
He's confused, he feels betrayed.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.880
He feels betrayed?

08:56.880 --> 09:00.080
He's still your son, your blood.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.600
Yeah, damn, rotten blood.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.400
Straight from a filthy
drunk who died of syphilis.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.640
The bloodline would've been
better off if it just died out.

09:17.160 --> 09:22.040
And Elizabeth... more
of that rotten blood.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.560
Turned my own son against me.

09:25.840 --> 09:30.640
We need around the clock
guards and we need an army.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.760
War is never the answer,
John. You taught me that.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.800
But, things change, Sarah.

09:36.800 --> 09:41.480
Whatever we get from the
next sale goes on guns...

09:43.120 --> 09:44.480
...ammo.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.200
We're not bringing any more
war into this world, John.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.360
We need that money for food,
for blankets, for shoes,

09:50.360 --> 09:53.640
for medicine, for
things that bring peace.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.880
Peace?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.440
Folks like me...

10:00.400 --> 10:03.160
...only peace we get
is what we can take.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.400
I put on a uniform, I killed for peace.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.160
I lost Andrew, for peace.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.320
I carved out this whole city
outta nothing, for peace.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.400
And I am not gonna let
Elizabeth take that away from me.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.320
Even if I have to kill her myself.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.760
You're scaring me, John.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.400
We're gearing up for war, stranger.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.400
War is a big word, isn't it?

11:07.160 --> 11:10.080
I don't think our father
uses it lightly either.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.120
We're worried about who's
getting caught on the other side.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.160
Seymour.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.920
We don't want him killed.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.240
Well, I guess your father
doesn't want him killed either.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.400
His feelings for Sarah
are clouding his judgement.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.640
When Pops first found her,
she wouldn't say a word.

11:42.400 --> 11:47.640
Seymour stuck by her, made
sure she ate, slept, all that.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.640
So, he wasn't too keen
when her and Father started

11:50.640 --> 11:52.520
looking at each other different.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.480
Honestly, it wasn't easy for us either.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.520
But it was good for them.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.320
They were both walking
around with these...

12:00.320 --> 12:02.920
...these black clouds, this darkness.

12:03.920 --> 12:07.000
When they were together, the
sun started shining through.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.760
What we're saying is, we're
starting to see the clouds again.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.360
Look, you've done more than your
fair share since you got here.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.760
We know it, our father
knows it. He trusts you.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.920
And we wouldn't be
here if he didn't. So...

12:31.120 --> 12:34.800
We're hoping you could
keep an eye on our father,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.160
just for a little while.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.280
Make sure no one gets
hurt if the storm rolls in.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.040
I'm not going anywhere.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.280
No, no. Please! No!

13:06.280 --> 13:08.520
- No, no, no.
- For God's sake!

13:12.720 --> 13:14.480
Please!

13:14.480 --> 13:16.600
Wait, wait!

13:20.400 --> 13:24.200
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

13:49.560 --> 13:51.840
Whoo! Whoo!

14:10.640 --> 14:12.000
You all right?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.720
Hey, what's going on?

14:23.240 --> 14:25.400
Do you remember the day you found me?

14:32.800 --> 14:34.200
Yeah, of course.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.080
Why were you there?

14:45.720 --> 14:47.800
I was returning from the front.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.000
Just passing through.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.200
The Comanches, they
were wearing Union blues.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.800
They were our guides.

15:03.400 --> 15:08.160
Me and some of the boys from the
company camped out by the river.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.640
The screams woke us up.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.440
Where did you find me?

15:17.920 --> 15:22.640
You were running down to
the river, near our tent.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.040
I don't know how you got there.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.600
And you stopped by the water

15:34.120 --> 15:35.960
and just stared out.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.840
That's not how I remember it.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.440
You weren't in a mind to remember.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.800
Being scared can do that to you.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.280
Do you remember you always said that

16:22.120 --> 16:24.280
whatever we are inside,

16:26.560 --> 16:28.640
we're always also the opposite?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.600
Yep.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.920
That loving someone...
means seeing both sides.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.360
I'm not scared of knowing,

16:47.200 --> 16:48.720
I'm scared of not.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.640
I have always been honest with you.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.800
I know you're hurt, and it feels unfair.

17:41.800 --> 17:45.160
But I'm convinced that you
were born to do great things.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.200
And that music you were playing,

17:51.760 --> 17:53.200
it wasn't yours,

17:55.560 --> 17:58.000
it wasn't the right music for you.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.000
Your... Your music has
to come from your heart.

18:12.920 --> 18:17.120
If hating me is what your heart
needs, then... then hate me.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.160
Put that hatred into your melodies.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.600
I ordered a new piano.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.480
All right, load her up.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.320
You don't want a free drink?

21:08.280 --> 21:10.040
What's eatin' you, brother?

21:11.680 --> 21:14.840
You can trust me.

21:14.840 --> 21:19.360
Sometimes the best way to let out
the rot is to spread it around.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.360
You know what I mean?

21:24.800 --> 21:27.320
All right, I'll guess.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.640
You're in a backwoods shit
hole in the middle of the night.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.080
You've got a dead look in your eye,

21:33.080 --> 21:36.040
you've been drinking a
long while on your own.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.840
You just came back from the war.

21:38.840 --> 21:44.520
And I'm thinking, either
the old lady left you or...

21:45.880 --> 21:47.840
...she got took by Injuns.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.800
Injuns. Definitely Injuns.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.800
The kids too?

21:57.760 --> 21:59.360
Two sons and a daughter.

21:59.640 --> 22:04.480
Well... This must be serendipity
that we met here tonight.

22:07.040 --> 22:12.840
My friends and I happen to kill
Injuns for fun and for profit.

22:13.720 --> 22:19.200
We rob the occasional bank and
we take the occasional hostage.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.600
And my name is Leonard Bolton.

22:23.560 --> 22:28.560
Most folks call me the Giant, on
account of my advanced stature.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.800
This is my brother, Peter.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.360
I bought him for thirty
dollars before the war.

22:36.360 --> 22:41.080
He chose to hang around, even though
Mr Lincoln made him a free man.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.960
The kid is Lawrence, and the
smart ass here is White Elk.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.720
Don't worry, he's one of the good ones.

22:52.120 --> 22:56.720
And that's Rosario, he came
all the way from Sicily.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.360
What's your name, stranger?

23:03.160 --> 23:04.360
Django.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.640
My name is Django.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.440
What do you say, Django?

23:14.120 --> 23:18.040
Want to make those godless
redskins pay for what they done

23:18.040 --> 23:21.520
to your family to the tune
of fifty bucks a scalp?

23:26.360 --> 23:30.160
Now, these guns, they
aren't gonna save us,

23:30.720 --> 23:34.960
because they are nothing if
we don't learn how to use 'em.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.560
If we don't learn how to
make 'em a part of ourselves.

23:38.560 --> 23:42.120
But that's what we're
gonna do, from today.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.800
Left, left, left-right...

23:46.800 --> 23:51.440
- Get ready! Take aim!
- Hold the line.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.000
Fire!

23:53.520 --> 23:56.200
We are going to turn New Babylon

23:56.200 --> 23:58.160
into an impenetrable fortress.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.040
Aim. Fire.

24:00.560 --> 24:05.120
So no one can come here and think
they can take what's ours again.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.160
Whoo, yeah!

24:09.360 --> 24:11.280
Hold the line. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.760
Left, left, left, left...

24:15.240 --> 24:16.960
C'mon, hold the line.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.560
Close your left eye and aim.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.080
Assume firing positions. Fire!

24:24.560 --> 24:25.920
Fire!

24:32.360 --> 24:35.440
Take aim. Fire!

24:47.040 --> 24:49.640
The herbs made him feel
better, until last night.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.880
Then all of a sudden, he got
real hot, he can't stay awake,

24:52.880 --> 24:54.560
he won't eat nothing...

24:54.560 --> 24:56.000
Mum.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.200
Boil this until it's
thick and make him drink.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.000
That'll cool him down until
the quinine is working.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.600
We don't have quinine.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.400
We will. I promise.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.240
I'll go and get it.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.240
Getting guns, huh?

25:40.240 --> 25:43.200
Yes, ma'am. The city's unassailable now.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.480
Hmm.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.440
And what about the girl?

25:51.640 --> 25:54.600
She is constantly challenging John.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.720
Hmm.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.200
She started to leave
the city on her own.

25:58.840 --> 26:03.000
The child is growing
up. How does John react?

26:04.120 --> 26:06.000
John isn't the same as he was.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.280
Ever since the master came
to the city to set fire

26:09.280 --> 26:12.920
to the wells, he's lost
his sense of reason.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.880
Well done, Aaron. You honour
the family you belong to.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.280
You must be tired, go
and get some food and rest

26:21.280 --> 26:23.760
before you go back to the devil's den.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.080
Ye... yes, ma'am. Thank you.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.520
What are you thinkin'?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.480
I wanna give you something.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.640
I wanna give you happiness.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.520
A happiness I have to live without.

27:52.280 --> 27:53.920
Now we wait...

27:59.040 --> 28:00.400
Where've you been?

28:05.720 --> 28:09.360
To get what we really need.
Marybell's son is sick.

28:09.520 --> 28:13.400
I'm trying to protect us,
I'm trying to protect you.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.920
It's not safe going
out there alone anymore.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.560
I'm a grown woman, I
can take care of myself.

28:19.560 --> 28:23.720
No, you can't. And you
thinking you can is insane.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.280
What's insane is what you're
doing to this place, John.

28:31.160 --> 28:34.880
I'm just putting an end to the...
to the wrongs I've suffered.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.920
I'm going out again tomorrow,
to get medicine for Frank's wife.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.920
You're too important.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.640
I'm forbidding you from
leaving New Babylon anymore.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.720
Are you giving me an order, John Ellis?

28:52.720 --> 28:54.120
Yes, I am.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.960
Sarah!

29:19.440 --> 29:21.600
Ever since the oil came...

29:23.480 --> 29:25.120
...everything changed.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.560
Or do you mean John changed?

29:32.200 --> 29:33.560
Do you think he's right?

29:34.280 --> 29:35.880
Well, he thinks he is.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.200
That's not what I asked.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.520
Since when do you care what I think?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.600
I don't know if it's right.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.760
I don't know, I've been running
from place to place my whole life.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.800
'Cause I thought that
was the right thing to do,

29:58.800 --> 30:01.200
and I only ended up making it worse.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.240
So, I'm the wrong person to ask.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.280
You're different.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.480
If you don't like where this place
is going, you should change it.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.240
You have the power to do that.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.080
You can fix what's broken.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.560
Look at me.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.520
Only you can do that.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.360
That's who you are.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.480
You have that strength.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.520
What's wrong?

30:37.040 --> 30:38.880
I couldn't fix it.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.960
I couldn't save them.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.120
You were just a little child.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.880
Right? There's nothing
you could have done.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.560
No, you're wrong.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.160
It was all my fault.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.640
I was untameable then.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.560
I used to spend all day
outside hunting, alone.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.280
And I hated Uncle Elijah.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.600
I hated him so much.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.280
Where have you been all afternoon?

32:17.440 --> 32:19.240
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.040
Please, Maggie.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.400
That's Daddy's.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.080
Don't you always say,
"A lady doesn't smoke"?

33:00.080 --> 33:02.280
A lady doesn't do most
things I've been doing

33:02.280 --> 33:04.560
since your father abandoned us.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.320
My father's coming back.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.960
The war's over, Sarah.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.880
Mr Garrett came back a month
ago and said he saw your father

33:15.880 --> 33:17.800
catching a train north.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.400
What do you think that means?

33:21.200 --> 33:24.160
If he really cared about us,
he never would have left at all.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.160
Maggie, that's not fair.
He left for all of us.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.960
Not for me.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.440
What's that supposed to mean?

33:38.920 --> 33:40.720
Ask your uncle.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.120
What does she mean?

33:42.840 --> 33:43.960
Nothin'.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.560
Why didn't Uncle Eli go with him?

33:45.560 --> 33:48.120
Why'd he send my father,
who had more kids?

33:48.120 --> 33:51.720
- Sarah, your father wanted to go.
- That's a damned lie!

33:51.720 --> 33:54.560
The truth is that he's a
filthy, good-for-nothing coward.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.120
Sarah! I will not allow
this language at my table.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.800
You're even worse than them. I hate you.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.600
I hate all of you.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.800
That night when...

34:09.880 --> 34:15.040
...when I went to sleep in the
barn, I left the rifle at the house.

34:29.120 --> 34:32.720
Later, when... the Comanches came, I...

34:35.960 --> 34:37.800
I knew they had killed Mom.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.040
Sarah, Sarah!

34:41.040 --> 34:44.320
And they killed Sammy
right in front of my eyes.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.400
I was so scared. And I did nothing...

34:48.560 --> 34:50.400
...nothing.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.040
Don't think like that.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.080
Nothing? You're alive. You're alive!

35:00.080 --> 35:01.600
That's everything.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.120
They would be so proud of you.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.000
God, I'm so proud of you.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.880
If they would see me right now,
they would never forgive me.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.880
And neither will I.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.400
Sarah, wait.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.880
Ucca!!

36:23.160 --> 36:24.520
Yeah!

36:24.920 --> 36:26.440
Whoo-hoo!!

36:43.360 --> 36:44.880
Welcome to hell.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.960
It's a lucky day. Easy pickings.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.560
They're mostly kids.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.720
A scalp's a scalp.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.280
The army can't tell the difference

37:07.280 --> 37:09.040
and they wouldn't care if they could.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.600
Whoo!

37:37.920 --> 37:41.000
It's a trap. Looks like
we got a fair fight.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.840
Yeehaw!

37:42.840 --> 37:44.800
Yeah! Ha!

38:08.720 --> 38:09.840
Ah!

38:25.040 --> 38:26.240
Aah!

39:29.960 --> 39:31.720
I need you to kidnap someone.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.800
A young woman.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.920
You flatter me, milady....

39:37.000 --> 39:41.520
What makes you think a
humble outlaw, such as myself,

39:41.520 --> 39:43.480
could do something like that?

39:45.480 --> 39:50.080
Now you're selling yourself short.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.200
Given the Giant is the most
wanted criminal in the state,

39:53.200 --> 39:55.360
there must be a reason why.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.120
It takes a special kind of...

39:58.120 --> 40:03.760
ingenuity for a man, or a woman,

40:03.760 --> 40:06.360
to rack up that many enemies.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.400
Half now...

40:15.400 --> 40:16.960
...half when it's done.

41:16.360 --> 41:17.840
I told you not to leave!

41:17.840 --> 41:19.280
What's going on?

41:19.280 --> 41:20.800
It's not your business, stranger.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.760
You're not getting back
on that horse, Sarah.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.320
We're all on the same side. Hold on.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.000
We're on the same side, right?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.920
I already told you, this
is not your business.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.880
- Sarah, what's going on?
- Tell him, John.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.080
Tell him why you dragged
me off that horse.

41:32.680 --> 41:36.840
Tell Frank's dying wife. Tell
everyone that you've gone crazy!

41:36.840 --> 41:38.400
Say it!

41:38.400 --> 41:40.040
- Huh! Ah!
- John, let her go.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.760
- John!
- John, let her go!

41:53.120 --> 41:55.120
Don't ever touch her again. You hear me?

41:55.120 --> 41:57.000
Don't ever touch her again!

42:28.280 --> 42:30.080
What the hell's gotten into you?

42:30.080 --> 42:31.960
What are you doing to this family?

42:31.960 --> 42:34.040
It's not safe!

42:34.040 --> 42:35.840
Then I'll go after her.

42:39.240 --> 42:42.760
Jeffrey, Sam, Darryl, you go with Kevin.

42:44.400 --> 42:49.200
Everyone else get back to training.
C'mon then, get back to training.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.040
You were looking for me?

43:53.120 --> 43:55.200
I told you I want you to be happy.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.360
So, I wanna give you what
you want most in the world.

44:01.480 --> 44:05.280
- I don't think that's possible.
- Oh, but of course it is.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.000
I'll give her to you.

44:11.400 --> 44:15.720
She'll wear my dress and
marry you in front of me.

44:16.720 --> 44:19.440
And you'll spend your first
night together right here.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.400
Then you'll take off,

44:22.800 --> 44:24.640
to the West Coast and...

44:25.640 --> 44:28.520
...start a new life
in the City of Angels

44:28.520 --> 44:31.440
and just forget about everything else.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.040
You convinced her of this plan?

44:34.960 --> 44:37.440
Hmm... not yet.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.720
You can tell the boss I'm fine.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.240
I know you are.

45:05.080 --> 45:08.440
I hope maybe some of that courage
of yours will rub off on me.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.200
It's not courage, Kevin.

45:11.120 --> 45:13.800
It's just what it looks like
on the other side of hell.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.400
She's not alone.

45:55.400 --> 45:56.720
How many others?

45:56.720 --> 45:59.240
Four. And two Negroes.

45:59.240 --> 46:03.160
Well, I guess your lady's
gonna have to pay extra then.

46:04.200 --> 46:05.480
All right.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.320
C'mon.
