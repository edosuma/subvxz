WEBVTT

00:10.135 --> 00:12.137
Yeah, I want Kansas City
minus four

00:12.220 --> 00:14.639
and Oral Roberts
plus nine and a half.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.225
You got to clamp that.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.270
Yeah, and while I got you,

00:20.311 --> 00:21.730
what's the line
on Thursday night?

00:21.771 --> 00:23.481
Cowboys minus six and a half,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.483
and the total's 45 and a half.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.485
You think the Giants
are gonna get up to seven?

00:27.527 --> 00:29.404
Nah. If anything,
it's going down.

00:29.487 --> 00:30.572
Anytime.

00:30.655 --> 00:31.823
Oh, crap,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.408
this valve is for shit.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.410
-I'm sorry?
-HEGLAND: Not you.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.537
Just a lifetime of pork chops.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.540
So listen, give me
a dime on the hoops

00:40.623 --> 00:42.417
and then I'm gonna wait
on the G-Men,

00:42.500 --> 00:43.960
just to, you know,
see if they get up to seven.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.170
You're down.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.796
All good. Yeah.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.256
(monitor flatlines)

00:48.340 --> 00:50.759
Oh, boy. Ah...

00:50.842 --> 00:52.302
Fire up the paddles.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.220
If you ever have a problem
with the ol' ticker,

00:54.304 --> 00:55.680
I got your guy.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.515
Terrific. So listen,
I don't see any way

00:57.557 --> 01:00.602
the IRS doesn't come
flying up your ass this year.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.020
What?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.480
It's right there.

01:03.521 --> 01:06.191
I listed all the expenses
for the gift shop.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.901
Lot of breakage, some theft.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.569
As you may recall,

01:09.652 --> 01:11.363
terrible flooding
in the storage room.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.031
-That hurt.
-Flooding?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.366
Out of nowhere.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.784
Aha.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.703
Did this flood damage
any of the neighboring stores?

01:18.787 --> 01:20.205
Hmm. Oddly no.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.332
The silver lining is
the inventory we did lose

01:22.374 --> 01:23.917
-is deductible.
-I see.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.544
I took the liberty
of writing it down right there.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.380
Very thoughtful.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.799
What's this townhouse
in Tarzana?

01:30.882 --> 01:32.342
Is that another office?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.886
Well, you're listing it
as a business expense.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.888
Well, no. Well, yeah. No.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.390
I'll tell you what it is.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.517
Um, do you believe in passion?

01:40.558 --> 01:43.228
-What?
-I met a girl.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.646
She's 24 years old
going on a hundred,

01:45.729 --> 01:47.065
very old soul.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.401
Anyway, she wants to be
an actress,

01:49.484 --> 01:51.569
which you know,
it's a rough road.

01:51.610 --> 01:53.947
I'm helping her pay her rent,

01:54.030 --> 01:58.702
and she in turn is helping me
resurrect my vitality,

01:58.743 --> 02:00.286
you know, my life force.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.665
Which, yeah, it's reflected
in my productivity.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.209
So yeah,
it's a business deduction.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.461
You're trying to write off
your mistress?

02:08.544 --> 02:12.340
If you want to ignore
everything I just said, fine.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.385
All right, maybe we can call
your townhouse

02:15.427 --> 02:16.928
a storage facility.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.596
You're the man.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.099
So, what do you think?

02:21.182 --> 02:22.600
You think I got a shot
at a refund?

02:22.684 --> 02:25.478
No, Danny, you have to pay taxes
to get a refund.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.939
-Well, that's bullshit.
-Listen to me,

02:27.981 --> 02:29.441
I have to sign these returns.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.027
If I know they're fraudulent,
I'm culpable.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.361
You know what that means?
Culpable?

02:33.445 --> 02:34.446
Yeah, I know what culp--

02:34.529 --> 02:35.989
It means you go down, I go down!

02:36.072 --> 02:37.574
Come on.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.617
You and I both know
the Feds look the other way

02:39.659 --> 02:41.453
when it comes to bookmaking.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.122
They don't with tax fraud.
That's how they got Capone!

02:44.164 --> 02:46.458
Okay, settle down.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.793
(sighs)
So, what's our next move?

02:48.835 --> 02:52.297
Our next move is you pay
a minimal amount

02:52.339 --> 02:54.090
-of income tax.
-Oh, I hate that.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.677
As opposed to everyone else
in the world who loves it?

02:58.928 --> 03:01.639
You need to come see my
sidewalk in front of my house.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.517
For years now,
buckled with tree roots.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.103
People trip, they fall.
Old people. Children.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.564
Where's my tax money at work?

03:09.647 --> 03:11.316
You would think I was living in,

03:11.358 --> 03:12.901
I don't know,
fucking Cleveland or something.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.320
If you like, I can include
a letter in your return

03:15.362 --> 03:17.530
about your buckled sidewalk.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.282
Great. I'll send you some JPEGs.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.034
I'm gonna prepare
these documents

03:21.117 --> 03:23.453
so everything's
on the up-and-up.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.539
Please tell me if there's
anything else I should know.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.709
Insurance scams,
young ladies with a dream?

03:30.835 --> 03:32.671
Why are you thinking?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.508
♪ ♪

03:44.099 --> 03:46.226
♪ I bet you won't
hit a motherfucker ♪

03:46.309 --> 03:47.977
♪ Hit a motherfucker ♪

03:48.019 --> 03:50.438
♪ Hit a motherfucker,
hit a motherfucker... ♪

03:50.522 --> 03:52.315
(music continues quietly)

03:52.357 --> 03:54.317
(sighs)

03:54.359 --> 03:56.778
-Hey, yo.
-Hey.

03:56.861 --> 03:57.862
Who's that?

03:57.946 --> 03:59.656
It's Three 6 Mafia.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.865
Mm.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.367
I like it, man.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.702
That's some real fresh OG shit.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.412
I'm glad you approve.
Give me my money.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.540
Yeah, yeah. About that.
I'm a little light.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.500
But you know I'm good for it.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.419
Why would I know that?

04:12.502 --> 04:13.920
Well, I just figured we've built

04:14.004 --> 04:17.048
a relationship, you know,
that foments trust.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.219
-(turns music off)
-Let me ask you something.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.430
On those occasions that you won,

04:23.513 --> 04:25.640
have I asked you
to do any fomenting?

04:25.724 --> 04:26.433
No.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.351
No. I paid in full.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.228
On time. No bullshit.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.063
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.440
I don't got it.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.859
(locks doors)

04:35.900 --> 04:37.652
Shit.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.446
I'm gonna call my partner.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.281
-Why?
-Shh.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.992
Hey, Danny.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.495
Yeah, I'm here with 712...

04:47.579 --> 04:50.832
Yeah, the frat fuck from USC.
Well, he's light.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.751
Hold on, let me put you
on speaker.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.587
-DANNY: How light?
-Not even close.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.964
Well, looks like
he's not gonna graduate.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.842
(laughs nervously)

05:00.925 --> 05:01.926
Funny.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.304
Uh, okay.
How-how-how about this?

05:04.387 --> 05:06.181
Alabama's a lock on Saturday.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.099
How about you let me put
what I owe on the moneyline?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.184
We even up.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.228
So, you want to go double
or nothing on a credit?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.646
Win-win.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.482
-RAY: You hearing this, Danny?
-I am.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.108
-Thoughts?
-Kill him.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.443
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.778
Wait. Hang on, fellas.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.529
(stammers)
We're friends, right?

05:21.613 --> 05:22.947
I ain't got no friends.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.408
Ray, you know what to do.
Be quick about it.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.868
ZACH:
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.454
Wait, wait, wait.
What if I go to my parents?

05:29.537 --> 05:31.039
Keep talking.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.374
I could ask for, you know,
a little bit of money

05:32.457 --> 05:33.375
from my trust fund.

05:33.457 --> 05:35.502
You hear that, Danny?

05:35.585 --> 05:37.796
Tinker Bell here
gets to live another day.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.882
And you don't have to hose out
the back of your car.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.092
24 hours.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.301
I understand. Thank you.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.844
And thanks, Danny, man, I app--

05:44.928 --> 05:46.930
Go.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.390
Thank you.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.771
He bought it.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.816
These stupid gangster movies
work in our favor.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.235
Hey, don't discount the fear
of a giant Black man.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.779
Could we at least agree
me being Italian helps a little?

06:02.821 --> 06:05.240
(chuckles) Yeah, Danny.
You're terrifying.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.826
Leave the gun, take the cannoli.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.077
Goodbye.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.832
(cheering over TV)

06:13.873 --> 06:15.083
Yes.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.336
Why don't you put that away
and watch the game with me?

06:18.420 --> 06:20.005
I don't like football.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.673
(exhales) Well, there's a way
to make it interesting,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.383
even if you don't like it.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.970
Is one team a force for good
and one team a force for evil?

06:27.012 --> 06:28.179
Not quite.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.181
How much money you got on you?

06:30.265 --> 06:32.808
-I don't know.
-Well, look.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.771
A dollar.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.276
Red team wins,
you bet on the red team,

06:41.359 --> 06:42.986
you get two dollars.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.529
Really?

06:44.612 --> 06:47.198
Do you want to bet your dollar
on the red team?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.366
Well, what if they lose?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.659
I get your dollar.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.037
Actually $1.10
'cause of the vig.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.247
But you know what?
You're family, I'll float you.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.999
But then I'll have nothing.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.709
No. No, no, no.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.712
You'll have several hours
of excitement and thrills.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.547
Pass.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.841
Smart boy.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.886
Look. It's Aunt Lorraine.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.180
Motherf--

07:10.221 --> 07:11.431
I like her hat.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.141
There's my guys.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.268
You know anything about this?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.354
Jesus. Is that legal?

07:17.395 --> 07:20.523
-No way.
-Well, then you got a problem.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.028
-(door opens)
-RAY: Hey.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.488
Hey.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.908
What the hell is that?

07:32.159 --> 07:33.411
Magic shrooms.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.039
What? Coffee not doing it
for you anymore?

07:36.831 --> 07:40.585
My sister-- your girlfriend--
has been growing these

07:40.669 --> 07:42.003
right underneath our noses,

07:42.087 --> 07:46.424
but also providing
therapeutic guidance

07:46.508 --> 07:48.176
to troubled souls.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.595
"Dr. Lorraine Colavito,

07:50.679 --> 07:52.681
graduate
of the UC Berkley Center

07:52.764 --> 07:54.933
for Psychedelic Facilitation."

07:54.974 --> 07:56.851
When did she become
a fucking doctor?

07:56.935 --> 07:58.770
She's not a fucking doctor.
She's a fucking drug dealer.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.188
This is gonna bring
nothing but heat.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.023
I do like the hat.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.943
-You seriously knew
nothing about this?
-Nothing.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.696
You got to ask yourself if
that's a healthy relationship.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.864
Lorraine. You got a minute?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.783
-Not a good time.
-I'm out!

08:11.825 --> 08:13.076
-DANNY: What's going on?
-(pants)

08:13.118 --> 08:14.953
I'm just a little busy
right now.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.455
-We need to talk.
-Yeah, like I said,
not a good time.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.581
At the bar. One hour.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.875
(grunting)

08:20.917 --> 08:21.668
Come back!

08:21.751 --> 08:23.712
We're your friends!

08:33.638 --> 08:36.099
Sorry, Mommy number three.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.227
Ah, fuck it.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.568
You miss the fancy one?

08:46.651 --> 08:48.194
No, I like this.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.780
It counts my steps,
let's me know if I'm breathing.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.449
Cares about me.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.784
Hey, sorry I'm late. I was
in Pilates when you called.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.578
What's he doing here?

08:56.661 --> 08:58.329
-If you don't want me here,
I'll leave.
-Sit down.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.832
-I'm really happy to leave.
-So, what's up?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.917
We know about the mushrooms.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.670
We know about the seances or
whatever the fuck you're doing.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.297
I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.631
Do you?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.508
Please, let me leave.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.677
All right, fine.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.179
But you've got it all wrong.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.223
You see, we provide therapy.
We're healers.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.601
-You're drug dealers.
-And you're
putting us all at risk.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.519
No, we're not selling it.
We give it away.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.938
-There's no law against
giving it away.
-Or not much of one.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.733
-So, what's the scam?
-LORRAINE: It's really
beautiful.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.234
The hallucinogenics are free.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.028
But the hand-holding costs
a fucking fortune.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.780
If you're a certified
psychedelic counselor.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.448
-Which I am.
-No, you're not.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.367
Okay, but nobody knows that.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.327
Hey, uh, you Danny Colavito?

09:37.369 --> 09:38.953
Who's asking?

09:39.037 --> 09:42.874
Uh, look, you don't know me,
but I owe you an amends.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.334
What're you talking about?

09:44.376 --> 09:45.794
Uh...

09:46.753 --> 09:48.421
-Give me your watch.
-Oh, shit!

09:48.505 --> 09:49.756
-It's him!
-Fuck.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.383
I thought I shot you.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.718
Yeah, yeah, you, uh, you did.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.512
-You shot him?
-Not now, Lorraine.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.181
You're busting my balls
for bringing happiness to people

09:58.223 --> 09:59.724
and you're shooting them
in the head?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.935
-He tried to mug me.
-I did.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.603
And-and I'm here
to make that right.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.813
How?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.439
I'm in a 12-step program,

10:06.523 --> 10:08.191
you know, 'cause of the meth
and crack, et cetera.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.984
And this is part
of my amends step.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.070
Yeah, I got another one
at 7-Eleven after this

10:12.153 --> 10:14.155
that I am not looking
forward to.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.782
So, you came down here
to say you're sorry

10:15.865 --> 10:17.158
and that's the end of it?

10:17.242 --> 10:18.576
I was hoping so.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.704
Oh, and I wanted to give you
a heads-up about Jerry.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.080
Who's Jerry?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.581
He's the waiter
that tipped me off.

10:23.665 --> 10:24.833
-He's really angry.
-He's alive?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.209
Did you shoot him, too?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.378
-No, he stabbed himself.
-Holy shit.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.588
Yeah, he is one angry fucker
with a colostomy bag.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.756
And he blames you.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.634
All right, well.
Let's see, uh...

10:34.718 --> 10:35.844
What's your name again?

10:35.927 --> 10:38.304
I'm Tarifa.
(chuckles softly)

10:38.388 --> 10:39.848
Okay, Tarifa.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.433
I accept your amends.

10:41.516 --> 10:45.937
And I also apologize for...
shooting you in the head.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.440
Wow, man.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.026
You know, my sponsor told me not
to expect anything in return,

10:51.067 --> 10:52.652
and yet...

10:52.736 --> 10:54.112
Thank you.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.824
Hmm.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.076
Damn.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.037
I think I'm gonna go
get me a slushy

11:02.120 --> 11:03.455
and make me another amends.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.165
Good for you.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.791
Go get 'em, chap.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.462
You know, in a different world,
he and I could've been friends.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.546
I'm still happy to leave.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.923
All right,
things are looking up.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.342
-RAY: Let's get out of here.
-DANNY: No.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.260
No more. I'm serious.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.429
-No more.
-You didn't hear a word we said.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.056
No more!

11:25.143 --> 11:26.478
(door opens)

11:26.561 --> 11:28.146
So, is that it? We done?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.481
(scoffs) Listen,

11:29.564 --> 11:32.275
I didn't get to where I am
by being a quitter.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.404

It's hot.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.502
Red-hot. A hobo can warm

12:32.544 --> 12:34.170
Please tell me you didn't
steal this from your own mother.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.463
Stepmother.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.049
She fellated her way
into my father's heart.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.342
I don't know, Zach.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.677
This is more trouble
than it's worth.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.220
It's fine.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.055

Wait, wait, wait.
So, you're the good son?

12:48.476 --> 12:49.894
That's fucked-up, right?

12:51.062 --> 12:53.023
-Can you give us a moment?
-Sure.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.566
I'll keep a lookout

backing up in your brain,
making you go crazy.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.003
Thank you, doctor.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.047
Oh, shit.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.715
Mind if we join you?

15:23.757 --> 15:24.966
Do we have a choice?

15:25.050 --> 15:28.970
Danny, Ray,

15:29.054 --> 15:31.723
I would like you to meet
a friend of mine.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.141
This is Patrick Ryan.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.226
I believe you know
his son, Zach.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.313
-No, doesn't ring a bell. Danny?
-No.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.732
Oh, come on, fellas, can we not
do this? The kid flipped on you.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.776
Flipped on us?
What are you talking about?

15:42.859 --> 15:44.319
You threatened his life.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.945
He had no choice
but to steal from his mother.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.572
Stepmother.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.951
Carl, you know how we operate.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.037
We don't pull any of that
strong-arm shit.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.831
Is there any chance that Zach's
brother might be involved?

15:56.915 --> 15:59.918
Yeah, we were given to believe
that he might be the bad penny.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.419
-Oh, yeah, he is.
-Mm.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.004
Except that during the time
of the break-in,

16:03.088 --> 16:05.090
Pat Junior was being held
without bail

16:05.173 --> 16:06.591
in Brownsville, Texas.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.094
Well, there is bail.
I'm just done with him.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.470
Tough love.
Good for you.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.222
Shut up.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.807
Here's how this works.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.434

charges against his son,

in there.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.445
This whole thing goes away.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.322
All you got to do is
return the jewelry.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.491
That's gonna be tough.
