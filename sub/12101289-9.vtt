WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.964
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.048 --> 00:04.510
[shouting] Don't spit that out!

00:04.593 --> 00:05.970
[whimpers]

00:06.054 --> 00:07.807
Mrs. Keyes is safe in custody.

00:08.601 --> 00:09.937
[Lawrence] We have a situation.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.526
A fugitive Handmaid
captured in Chicago.

00:12.609 --> 00:13.611
Do with her what you will.

00:14.195 --> 00:15.364
[Janine] Aunt Lydia, please.

00:15.447 --> 00:17.577
Just don't send me
back into service.

00:17.661 --> 00:19.413
I'd rather die here.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.835
Whatever are we going
to do with you?

00:22.044 --> 00:25.927
Anger is necessary to heal.
But we can't live there.

00:26.010 --> 00:28.766
Why does healing
have to be the only goal?

00:28.891 --> 00:31.563
Why can't we be as furious
as we feel?

00:31.647 --> 00:34.987
With Offred now in Canada,
we can't be naive about that.

00:35.738 --> 00:36.699
[heels clicking]

00:36.782 --> 00:39.412
She could put us both away
for the maximum sentence

00:39.495 --> 00:41.667
and prevent you from being
a mother to your son.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.336
We need to drop our fight.

00:43.588 --> 00:45.508
My name is June Osborn.

00:45.592 --> 00:47.303
Fred Waterford and Serena Joy

00:47.386 --> 00:50.893
imprisoned me, beat me,
and raped me.

00:50.977 --> 00:51.937
No. No! Stop!

00:52.062 --> 00:54.400
The underground
resistance movement in Gilead

00:54.526 --> 00:57.323
provided the means
for me to escape.

00:57.406 --> 00:59.536
I couldn't leave
my daughter Hannah behind.

00:59.619 --> 01:00.955
So I stayed.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.669
To bring her back to her father.

01:07.259 --> 01:08.303
[gasps softly]

01:08.428 --> 01:10.057
I'm her mother.

01:10.182 --> 01:12.436
It is my job to protect her.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.106
And I failed.

01:16.235 --> 01:17.989
[Luke sobbing]

01:18.073 --> 01:21.329
Luke, I need to tell you about
the last time I saw Hannah.

01:30.097 --> 01:32.101
[church bells ringing]

02:06.920 --> 02:07.922
I'm sorry.

02:10.385 --> 02:11.471
Luke, I'm...

02:13.851 --> 02:15.187
‐I'm so sorry.
‐No.

02:16.063 --> 02:18.401
They put Hannah
in that situation.

02:19.487 --> 02:20.990
Those fucking animals.

02:22.535 --> 02:23.996
Whatever happened there,

02:24.079 --> 02:25.917
that is on them,
that is not on you.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.304
She's safe now.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.897
Nick told me she's back home.

02:41.782 --> 02:42.784
She's home?

02:43.577 --> 02:46.374
Home is here.
Home is here with us.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.417
I know.

02:52.554 --> 02:56.603
We have to find her
and bring her to Canada.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.651
How?

03:03.576 --> 03:05.663
How do we do that from here?

03:06.957 --> 03:08.126
We can do it.

03:10.046 --> 03:11.173
We can do it together.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.013
Hey, June. June...

03:17.060 --> 03:18.146
I promise you.

03:19.189 --> 03:20.693
We can do it together.

03:25.661 --> 03:27.540
Let me show you
what I've tried so far.

03:31.632 --> 03:33.844
Yeah, I leaned on everyone
in the Embassy.

03:33.927 --> 03:35.765
They run when they see me now.

03:36.683 --> 03:39.104
This is our lawsuits
that went nowhere.

03:39.188 --> 03:41.359
This is info from activists
in the underground.

03:41.442 --> 03:43.697
These are interviews
with people who escaped.

03:44.406 --> 03:45.660
You did all this?

03:47.872 --> 03:50.168
There's not a day that went by
that I shouldn't have done more.

03:50.544 --> 03:52.548
[footsteps approaching]

03:54.969 --> 03:56.347
‐[Moira] Hey.
‐[Luke] Oh, hey.

03:56.472 --> 03:58.184
What's goin' on?
Why's all this out?

03:59.144 --> 04:02.025
[June] I told Luke about
the last time I saw her.

04:02.568 --> 04:05.908
He knows everything now.
About Hannah.

04:06.827 --> 04:09.081
[Luke] Yeah, I got a VIP
on my side now.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.795
[Moira] Well, you got 86 kids
outta Gilead.

04:12.797 --> 04:14.801
You have power. Use it.

04:15.970 --> 04:16.972
Thanks.

04:20.604 --> 04:24.863
Okay, so we bang
on every door again,

04:24.946 --> 04:28.161
and we call up anyone
that could be of use in Toronto.

04:28.244 --> 04:30.290
[June] Okay, who has
the best resources?

04:30.373 --> 04:33.254
[scoffs] I mean, nobody so far.
Not in Canada.

04:36.553 --> 04:37.972
What about someone new?

04:38.932 --> 04:40.101
In Gilead.

04:45.361 --> 04:47.365
[line ringing]

04:58.262 --> 04:59.599
[static]

05:00.643 --> 05:02.980
[Lawrence over phone]
Hello, June Osborn.

05:03.106 --> 05:05.318
And hello, Canada.

05:07.322 --> 05:09.243
Thank you for taking the call.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.746
How are you?

05:10.830 --> 05:13.752
Oh, I'm peachy.
The weather's fine, too.

05:14.211 --> 05:15.881
You must want something.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.136
I need your help.

05:20.808 --> 05:22.227
It's about getting Hannah.

05:23.187 --> 05:24.189
[sighs]

05:25.441 --> 05:26.695
Again with this?

05:27.822 --> 05:28.949
She's my daughter.

05:29.074 --> 05:31.663
Yeah, and you're
Mother of the Year.

05:31.746 --> 05:34.502
What a nightmare
you've been for her.

05:34.711 --> 05:36.798
Just leave the poor kid alone.

05:36.882 --> 05:39.888
She needs to be with me
and her father.

05:39.971 --> 05:44.062
Does she? Honestly.
Does she, June?

05:45.566 --> 05:48.655
‐She has a lovely home‐‐
‐[June] That is not her home!

05:48.739 --> 05:51.745
It's all she knows.
You wanna rip her out of there?

05:51.828 --> 05:54.249
No one will love her like we do.

05:56.963 --> 05:59.594
Your love fucks people up.

06:01.263 --> 06:04.186
You're a fountain
of heartache and trouble.

06:08.361 --> 06:12.578
But you'll be happy to know
that, uh, your friend is okay.

06:12.662 --> 06:13.705
[June] What friend?

06:13.789 --> 06:16.335
The one with the eye patch.

06:20.636 --> 06:21.846
Janine?

06:24.101 --> 06:27.190
[Lawrence] She is safe and sound
at The Red Center.

06:32.409 --> 06:33.829
No, she's...

06:35.206 --> 06:36.458
Fuck. No.

06:37.043 --> 06:39.549
[Lawrence] Indeed she is. Um...

06:40.425 --> 06:43.264
She's got a roof over her head,
three meals a day,

06:43.389 --> 06:47.314
and Aunt Lydia
to tuck her in at night.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.668
[sniffles]

07:00.256 --> 07:01.593
Okay, look,

07:02.385 --> 07:07.020
the Americans
will push to revise Section 22B

07:07.605 --> 07:11.654
in Canada's Trade Agreement
with Gilead if you help me.

07:11.780 --> 07:14.660
[laughs] The Americans
don't have a pot to piss in.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.332
They still think they can
boss around the Canadians.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.419
No, you have to do better.

07:25.306 --> 07:26.726
Tell you what.

07:27.603 --> 07:29.106
I'll make you a deal.

07:30.274 --> 07:31.653
I'll get you Hannah

07:32.696 --> 07:36.161
if you get me ten of the kids
you flew out of here.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.671
I hear a lot of them
are struggling.

07:40.754 --> 07:44.554
They miss their parents
in Gilead.

07:46.348 --> 07:48.687
You know we're never
giving those children back.

07:49.522 --> 07:51.568
Come on.
That's how you negotiate?

07:52.653 --> 07:57.495
The June I know would bargain,
at least, to save her daughter.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.418
Say, five of those kids
for Hannah?

08:10.438 --> 08:11.858
I can't.

08:14.487 --> 08:15.574
No.

08:18.580 --> 08:19.665
[Lawrence] Wow.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.420
You've gone soft in Toronto.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.174
Must be all that maple syrup.

08:26.470 --> 08:27.765
We love her.

08:33.359 --> 08:35.238
We are her family.

08:40.206 --> 08:42.544
Joseph, I know
you are a good man.

08:47.972 --> 08:50.268
I've heard they're hard to find.

08:56.071 --> 08:59.452
Now is not the time for me
to stir up any trouble.

08:59.537 --> 09:02.751
I promise you that
we will do everything

09:02.876 --> 09:05.381
that we can to protect you...

09:06.634 --> 09:08.178
June, you're free.

09:10.349 --> 09:11.769
You're free.

09:14.650 --> 09:17.990
Try to be grateful for that
and move on.

09:22.081 --> 09:23.334
If you can.

09:38.657 --> 09:40.076
[indistinct radio chatter]

09:42.831 --> 09:44.042
[door opens]

09:45.461 --> 09:46.756
[door closes]

09:58.988 --> 10:00.909
[Aunt Lydia]
Such childish nonsense.

10:01.451 --> 10:03.080
Wasting everyone's time.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.004
You have been given
a precious gift, dear.

10:07.088 --> 10:09.719
A second chance to serve God.

10:10.929 --> 10:13.643
To atone for all the trouble
you've caused.

10:28.965 --> 10:29.967
[thuds]

10:44.037 --> 10:47.210
Now, be a good girl and eat.

10:52.303 --> 10:55.519
It is so hard to be good

10:55.602 --> 10:57.856
when you've had
such a bad example.

11:01.196 --> 11:04.494
Esther, you must
cleanse yourself

11:04.912 --> 11:06.999
of those corrupting influences.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.295
You must be strong.

11:29.670 --> 11:30.797
[scrubbing]

11:50.712 --> 11:51.756
[Aunt Lydia] Janine.

11:52.340 --> 11:53.258
[door closes]

11:53.383 --> 11:55.513
Esther has had
a little accident.

11:56.389 --> 11:58.686
‐Clean it up?
‐[Janine] Yes, Aunt Lydia.

12:00.565 --> 12:01.776
[Aunt Lydia] Thank you, dear.

12:02.945 --> 12:05.909
God loves us for our labors.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.812
[rain pattering]

12:22.108 --> 12:23.695
It's another jersey.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.657
The home team.

12:26.701 --> 12:28.621
See how the people
embrace us now.

12:30.165 --> 12:31.794
[chuckles] Look at this.

12:32.838 --> 12:34.591
"For the future Commander."

12:34.925 --> 12:36.177
[chuckles]

12:38.473 --> 12:41.814
His father's son.
Ah, isn't that clever?

12:42.691 --> 12:44.820
I'm sorry.
It's just not the baby shower

12:44.903 --> 12:46.197
that I had imagined.

12:46.281 --> 12:48.661
I know, but take comfort
in their support.

12:50.665 --> 12:53.420
These people understand
our mission was pure.

12:54.213 --> 12:55.967
Our baby inspires them.

12:56.635 --> 12:57.804
Look.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.438
We're "beacons of hope."

13:03.190 --> 13:04.275
Read this.

13:06.154 --> 13:07.783
Am I allowed now?

13:11.414 --> 13:13.251
Now that nobody's watching?

13:17.719 --> 13:18.888
I've made mistakes.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.894
If only we could start over.

13:22.813 --> 13:24.440
Well, we can't, Fred.
Here we are.

13:26.486 --> 13:27.739
Yeah.

13:28.198 --> 13:31.079
Well, God has a plan for us.

13:31.789 --> 13:34.545
You must carry on,
raise our boy.

13:36.757 --> 13:40.515
Spread the Lord's word.
Yeah, they're ready to listen.

13:42.686 --> 13:46.025
You know, the world should
hear your voice again.

13:48.531 --> 13:49.741
Write a book.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.413
You've done it before.

14:02.057 --> 14:03.853
We must be patient.

14:04.395 --> 14:06.149
We can't let her starve herself.

14:06.232 --> 14:08.194
It could impact
her ability to conceive.

14:09.447 --> 14:12.829
That girl needs another
correction to encourage her.

14:14.415 --> 14:18.381
Perhaps you're right.
She's been so defiant.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.306
I say restraints
and a feeding tube,

14:22.389 --> 14:24.143
so she gets
the proper nutrition.

14:25.688 --> 14:27.483
I don't see
why she needs her tongue.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.778
She won't use it.

14:28.903 --> 14:30.072
[gasps]

14:31.951 --> 14:33.119
It's all right, dear.

14:33.203 --> 14:35.290
Why don't you
go into the kitchen

14:35.415 --> 14:37.002
and see if they need your help.

14:37.712 --> 14:40.802
Yes, Aunt Lydia.
Sorry. Thank you.

14:44.392 --> 14:45.477
[door opens]

14:45.937 --> 14:47.649
‐She means well.
‐[door closes]

14:47.732 --> 14:48.734
She's trying.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.703
‐She's been very helpful.
‐Yes.

14:54.036 --> 14:56.124
Yes. Such a lovely,
fruitful girl.

14:57.459 --> 14:59.046
We can't keep her here forever.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.677
Yes, I agree.

15:02.679 --> 15:06.812
We will find an appropriate
posting for her. Soon.

15:08.189 --> 15:10.820
Except, what Commander would
want a girl with her history?

15:14.243 --> 15:17.124
Any family would be blessed
to have Janine!

15:17.499 --> 15:20.506
She has given two beautiful
children to Gilead!

15:20.590 --> 15:22.844
Exactly why she should be sent
to the Breeding Colonies

15:22.927 --> 15:24.556
‐as was the original plan.
‐[Aunt Lydia scoffs]

15:24.639 --> 15:29.816
We mustn't forget how valuable
she has been in this district.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.862
If it hadn't been
for Janine's intervention,

15:31.945 --> 15:34.158
that poor Putnam child
would never have survived.

15:35.077 --> 15:36.162
Perhaps.

15:37.749 --> 15:42.132
But any special treatment,
consider the precedent.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.178
Thank you for your suggestions.

15:44.261 --> 15:46.683
I will give them
careful consideration...

15:49.689 --> 15:53.488
then make my decision.

15:55.075 --> 15:56.912
This chicken is dry.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.835
[coughs]

16:02.841 --> 16:03.843
[exhales]

16:08.519 --> 16:10.355
Ah! Thank you for the tea.

16:12.902 --> 16:14.280
[sighs]

16:23.047 --> 16:26.345
You'll be all right, dear.
I'll take care of you.

16:33.359 --> 16:36.658
Um, actually,
I wanted to say something.

16:37.284 --> 16:40.875
About Mrs. Keyes. Esther. Sorry.

16:44.465 --> 16:46.010
She's not as tough as you think.

16:46.093 --> 16:48.139
She's just acting that way
because she's scared.

16:52.649 --> 16:54.611
She had a really hard life
on the farm.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.575
She was abused,

16:57.825 --> 17:00.163
not just by her husband,
but by a lot of men.

17:02.209 --> 17:04.004
I just think
you should know that.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.344
I see.

17:11.352 --> 17:15.569
Well, we have tried
to be understanding with her.

17:15.653 --> 17:17.699
She is a difficult girl.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.548
Maybe she needs
to feel safe here.

17:28.094 --> 17:30.390
Like, if she's refusing to eat,

17:31.768 --> 17:33.479
maybe if someone told her
what would happen

17:33.564 --> 17:34.774
if you don't obey?

17:38.616 --> 17:41.120
I just think she deserves
a chance before you...

17:52.267 --> 17:53.562
[clears throat]

17:53.854 --> 17:58.237
I will put Esther's correction
on hold.

17:59.198 --> 18:00.283
For now.

18:02.496 --> 18:03.916
Thank you, Aunt Lydia.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.212
Thank you so much.

18:08.634 --> 18:12.600
Perhaps she would benefit
from your unique perspective.

18:13.351 --> 18:15.313
Why don't you
bring her breakfast tomorrow?

18:15.940 --> 18:18.152
You two can have a little chat.

18:20.031 --> 18:21.033
'Kay.

18:22.411 --> 18:24.498
[footsteps receding]

18:40.823 --> 18:41.825
[sighs]

19:14.014 --> 19:15.183
[sobs]

19:33.512 --> 19:34.514
[sniffles]

19:46.245 --> 19:47.455
Oh, hey.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.715
[Luke] I was thinking about
what happened with Lawrence.

19:57.142 --> 19:58.854
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I really tried‐‐

19:58.937 --> 20:00.691
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I get it.

20:00.774 --> 20:01.943
He's a fuckin' asshole.

20:02.027 --> 20:03.697
Uh, but there's, um...

20:04.281 --> 20:06.285
There's someone else
who I think could help.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.170
Nick.

20:14.677 --> 20:18.142
'Cause he knew that Hannah
had gone back to the Mackenzies,

20:18.225 --> 20:21.816
and, uh, so he might know
where she lives,

20:21.900 --> 20:23.319
or he could find out.

20:28.705 --> 20:29.791
Um...

20:32.253 --> 20:36.387
Yeah. I mean, maybe. I...

20:37.347 --> 20:38.307
I don't know.

20:38.391 --> 20:41.690
He's a Commander now, right?
Big man. He's got access.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.403
So, we should probably ask him
before that changes.

20:44.486 --> 20:46.365
[inhales deeply] You know.

20:56.636 --> 20:57.638
Yeah.

20:58.849 --> 21:00.018
Okay, yeah.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.732
Maybe Tuello could
set up a call.

21:04.026 --> 21:07.115
So you think Nick would help?

21:11.290 --> 21:14.672
I think he would do anything
for me and for Nichole.

21:15.966 --> 21:16.968
Yeah.

21:24.357 --> 21:26.236
I don't think you should call,

21:27.030 --> 21:29.159
with people listening and stuff.
You should...

21:29.242 --> 21:31.497
It'd probably be better
just to meet him in person.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.090
You know, just make it safe.
Someplace protected.

21:36.883 --> 21:37.885
Right?

21:39.806 --> 21:41.935
You want me
to meet up with Nick?

21:42.060 --> 21:43.354
[laughs]

21:45.024 --> 21:48.949
No. No, I don't want you
to meet with Nick.

21:51.621 --> 21:53.165
But you said
he'd do anything for you.

21:53.249 --> 21:56.171
So, this is our best chance
to get Hannah. And so...

22:01.850 --> 22:04.689
I think you should
take Nichole with you.

22:07.402 --> 22:10.158
How's he gonna say no to you
if you bring him his daughter?

22:18.717 --> 22:20.052
So, what do you think?

22:33.663 --> 22:35.918
I think we have
to try everything.

22:36.418 --> 22:37.504
Yeah.

22:39.550 --> 22:40.719
For Hannah.

22:45.269 --> 22:46.438
[softly] For Hannah.

22:49.361 --> 22:50.446
Yeah.

23:05.686 --> 23:08.399
Good. Good, good, good.

23:11.238 --> 23:12.448
All right, then.

23:14.452 --> 23:15.622
I'm gonna go wash up.

23:47.310 --> 23:48.312
[knock on door]

23:48.395 --> 23:49.565
[door beeps, unlocks]

23:50.525 --> 23:52.529
[footsteps approaching]

24:00.169 --> 24:01.547
Surprise!

24:01.631 --> 24:02.758
[chuckles]

24:05.012 --> 24:08.394
Naomi. Oh.
It's wonderful to see you.

24:09.312 --> 24:12.736
Oh, I pled my case for months,
trying to visit.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.575
But your due date approaching,
they finally gave us permission.

24:15.659 --> 24:16.994
‐[door locks, beeps]
‐Warren is here, too,

24:17.078 --> 24:18.080
to see Fred.

24:18.163 --> 24:20.418
Oh, well,
isn't this our lucky day?

24:20.502 --> 24:21.754
Such a miracle.

24:22.171 --> 24:24.552
You look well.
How are you feeling?

24:25.010 --> 24:27.891
Fine. Very...
Very good, considering.

24:27.975 --> 24:30.187
Well, this is nicer
than I expected. It's...

24:31.356 --> 24:33.026
It's light and airy.

24:33.695 --> 24:35.740
How are you? How's Angela?

24:35.824 --> 24:38.036
Sit, please. Oh, she's my joy.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.917
She's running around.
Learning so many words.

24:41.502 --> 24:43.046
There's a bit of an issue
with biting,

24:43.130 --> 24:44.424
but maybe that's genetic.

24:46.178 --> 24:47.263
So...

24:53.484 --> 24:56.281
I'm afraid that
they won't give us much time.

24:56.741 --> 24:59.078
Uh, the...

24:59.622 --> 25:02.961
Security opened these
when I arrived, but from Leah.

25:03.253 --> 25:06.343
Oh, thank you. It's beautiful.

25:06.761 --> 25:09.725
‐And this is from Grace.
‐Thank you.

25:11.604 --> 25:14.693
And then this is from Caroline.
There's something from everyone.

25:15.069 --> 25:16.948
We're so thrilled
for you, Serena.

25:17.406 --> 25:20.956
I wasn't sure, after my actions
concerning Fred.

25:21.081 --> 25:24.337
Oh, no. You did what
you had to do as a mother,

25:24.420 --> 25:25.966
to be with Nichole.

25:27.553 --> 25:29.932
And if the good Lord
has blessed you with this child,

25:30.015 --> 25:31.476
then who am I to judge?

25:33.438 --> 25:34.650
Well, thank you, Naomi.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.737
You've always been
a great friend.

25:40.787 --> 25:43.083
I want you to know that,

25:44.294 --> 25:46.924
if this ordeal isn't over
by the time the baby comes,

25:47.884 --> 25:50.347
it would be our honor
to raise him in our home.

25:55.024 --> 25:56.736
Oh. That's, um...

25:58.030 --> 25:59.407
That's very kind of you.

25:59.490 --> 26:02.163
I mean, you don't want
strangers in Canada to do it.

26:02.706 --> 26:06.589
He would still be yours,
of course, if you're released.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.014
Although Fred's prospects
are less optimistic,

26:11.097 --> 26:14.062
I expect to be free
once proceedings are over with.

26:15.732 --> 26:18.362
It will be a fresh start
with our son.

26:22.453 --> 26:25.752
Well, that's wonderful.
You can...

26:26.127 --> 26:27.380
You can come home.

26:27.839 --> 26:30.512
That baby belongs in Gilead.
You both do.

26:31.429 --> 26:33.183
I don't think the Commanders
feel the same way.

26:33.266 --> 26:34.520
Oh, nonsense.

26:35.187 --> 26:37.191
You'll return
with your own child.

26:37.859 --> 26:38.945
Like a hero.

26:44.748 --> 26:46.000
[Commander Fred] Oh!

26:47.546 --> 26:49.298
You shouldn't have.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.302
[Warren] Feel it.

26:52.889 --> 26:54.058
It's firm, right?

26:55.770 --> 26:56.981
Smooth draw.

26:57.816 --> 26:58.985
Full body flavor.

26:59.068 --> 27:00.989
How I've craved a good cigar.

27:01.532 --> 27:02.617
Light it up.

27:03.118 --> 27:04.872
I'll save it for later.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.295
Something to look forward to.

27:08.796 --> 27:11.050
Many thanks
to my brothers back home.

27:11.176 --> 27:13.013
Well, we so respect and admire

27:13.096 --> 27:15.142
how you've weathered
this crisis.

27:16.562 --> 27:18.190
You stayed loyal to Gilead,

27:19.150 --> 27:20.570
true to God's word.

27:22.031 --> 27:25.037
From God, I draw strength.
I feel Him with me every moment.

27:25.454 --> 27:29.212
I hoped to say the same
for my fellow Commanders.

27:31.257 --> 27:32.468
My apologies.

27:33.178 --> 27:35.432
We should have
reached out to you sooner.

27:36.351 --> 27:37.854
Out of sight, out of mind.

27:37.938 --> 27:39.065
Not at all.

27:39.983 --> 27:43.406
It pains me, Fred,
knowing your situation.

27:45.244 --> 27:47.541
But, priorities.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.840
The damage done when
all those children were stolen?

27:52.926 --> 27:55.013
It's been difficult for us
to repair.

27:55.138 --> 27:56.224
I can imagine.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.103
Well, I pressed to retaliate,

27:59.397 --> 28:01.359
but old war horses like us,

28:02.111 --> 28:03.906
we're being put out to pasture.

28:05.075 --> 28:09.585
As you can see, my pasture's
rather small and fenced in.

28:10.795 --> 28:13.801
Has there been
any negotiation on my behalf?

28:15.095 --> 28:16.306
Such as?

28:19.145 --> 28:20.272
[scoffs]

28:21.357 --> 28:22.484
A prisoner exchange?

28:22.569 --> 28:25.575
Perhaps a promise to advance
more humanitarian efforts?

28:26.409 --> 28:27.954
What if we negotiate?

28:28.038 --> 28:29.415
Yes. What if?

28:29.498 --> 28:32.631
We'd embolden more kidnappings.

28:33.674 --> 28:35.970
More Commanders
being held hostage.

28:37.097 --> 28:38.308
Think of the precedent.

28:38.391 --> 28:41.189
I'm thinking of my years
of service to the Republic.

28:41.272 --> 28:43.736
I'm thinking of
my wife and my son!

28:49.330 --> 28:54.173
We will continue to send you
our thoughts and prayers.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.396
[door creaks]

29:32.374 --> 29:33.878
[electricity buzzing]

29:39.263 --> 29:40.641
I knew you'd come!

29:42.854 --> 29:44.106
How did you get past them?

29:45.651 --> 29:47.781
You should eat
before we catch up.

29:47.947 --> 29:49.618
It sucks to be hungry.

29:51.037 --> 29:53.500
I know,
I almost starved in Chicago.

29:54.920 --> 29:55.963
Chicago?

29:56.757 --> 29:57.842
Mm‐hmm.

29:59.513 --> 30:00.932
You made it all the way there?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.186
Eat.

30:07.027 --> 30:09.240
How'd you even sneak this
out of the kitchen?

30:12.120 --> 30:14.584
What happened?
Was June with you?

30:15.377 --> 30:16.922
How did you all get there?

30:17.005 --> 30:20.596
Oh, uh, we took a train
and then, um,

30:21.515 --> 30:23.142
some people took us in.

30:24.228 --> 30:26.107
Then we got bombed.

30:26.567 --> 30:28.111
It's really scary.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.745
I was actually kind of relieved
when they picked me up,

30:33.288 --> 30:35.250
even though they brought me
back here.

30:37.254 --> 30:38.883
Nothing is worse than here.

30:40.803 --> 30:42.765
[chomping]

30:45.395 --> 30:46.815
[exhales]

30:51.909 --> 30:54.455
‐So, is June still in Chicago?
‐Forget June.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.127
She's not here.

30:59.674 --> 31:00.927
We're here.

31:01.678 --> 31:03.891
And you have to
take care of yourself now.

31:09.611 --> 31:11.657
If you keep misbehaving,

31:12.659 --> 31:15.413
there will be consequences,
okay?

31:18.504 --> 31:21.217
So you're gonna have to eat
for them, too, not just for me.

31:24.766 --> 31:25.685
[spits]

31:30.110 --> 31:31.989
You didn't sneak in!

31:33.826 --> 31:35.120
They sent you.

31:38.794 --> 31:40.798
Go on and call
your Aunt friends.

31:41.508 --> 31:43.219
I don't care what they do to me.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.265
Yes, you do.

31:49.023 --> 31:50.985
They're not going to
let you die.

31:51.778 --> 31:55.911
They will keep hurting you,
again and again,

31:55.995 --> 31:58.166
until you do what they say!
That is their job!

32:08.771 --> 32:10.231
It's no big deal.

32:13.989 --> 32:16.327
You just have to eat.

32:30.564 --> 32:32.317
You need to stay alive

32:33.236 --> 32:35.908
so you can be here
when things get better.

32:43.674 --> 32:44.968
I'll come back.

32:46.470 --> 32:48.642
And I'll keep coming back
until you eat.

32:50.145 --> 32:51.648
And when you do,
I'll tell Aunt Lydia,

32:51.731 --> 32:53.902
and then she'll
let you go outside.

32:56.323 --> 32:57.910
It's a really nice day.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.256
[door opens]

33:06.218 --> 33:07.555
[door closes]

33:24.463 --> 33:26.635
Hi, boo‐boo. All buckled in.

33:30.350 --> 33:33.607
I, uh...
I got some extra diapers

33:33.690 --> 33:35.653
and I put some snacks in there
as well.

33:35.736 --> 33:37.447
I just... I sliced up
some peaches and...

33:37.531 --> 33:39.368
‐Oh, thank you.
‐Yeah, I...

33:39.911 --> 33:42.207
Okay, the officers'll
follow you.

33:42.583 --> 33:45.338
They'll give you some privacy,
but stay close by.

33:45.421 --> 33:46.883
When you get there,
keep it brief.

33:46.967 --> 33:48.637
All right. Thanks.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.923
Hey, I need you
not to worry, okay?

34:07.007 --> 34:08.760
[sputters] I'm not gonna be
able to do that.

34:10.221 --> 34:11.223
All right.

34:11.975 --> 34:14.062
I'm gonna be here
when you get home. Okay?

34:16.776 --> 34:17.778
'Kay.

34:41.283 --> 34:42.703
[Nichole babbles]

35:45.161 --> 35:46.706
[wind howling]

36:41.481 --> 36:42.818
[Nick] June.

37:01.271 --> 37:02.482
Freedom agrees with you.

37:06.824 --> 37:07.952
Thanks.

37:11.083 --> 37:15.968
So, how... How's it all going
down there in Gilead?

37:17.846 --> 37:19.307
Hanging in there.

37:21.813 --> 37:23.190
Poor choice of words.

37:34.797 --> 37:36.258
Thank you for meeting me.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.594
[Nichole cooing]

37:37.720 --> 37:39.097
Thanks for inviting me.

37:48.825 --> 37:50.327
[chuckles softly]

37:57.425 --> 37:59.137
She's a little bigger,
isn't she?

37:59.220 --> 38:03.062
Oh. She's a whole
different person.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.525
Hi there, sweetheart.

38:06.026 --> 38:08.238
Hi, Nichole. Hi.

38:09.533 --> 38:11.704
Um, I have a Secret Service
with me,

38:11.788 --> 38:13.583
so I can't stay long.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.258
Okay. Let's go talk inside.

38:18.342 --> 38:19.219
[June] Okay.

38:34.499 --> 38:35.794
[Nichole gurgling]

38:40.469 --> 38:42.808
[Nichole continues cooing]

38:43.350 --> 38:44.687
Hi, sweetie.

38:47.734 --> 38:50.657
I'm sure you're curious
what this is about.

38:53.412 --> 38:55.166
I don't wanna put you
in any danger.

38:55.249 --> 38:59.257
But if there's anything
you can find out about Hannah‐‐

38:59.340 --> 39:00.426
When you made it to Canada,

39:00.510 --> 39:01.804
I knew you'd keep
looking for her,

39:03.056 --> 39:05.352
so I started putting
some stuff together.

39:06.354 --> 39:08.108
Never thought I'd
give it to you in person.

39:16.709 --> 39:18.295
Oh, my God.

39:19.965 --> 39:21.134
Oh, my God.

39:25.309 --> 39:27.564
She lives in
the Westward Territory?

39:27.648 --> 39:30.987
Colorado. Colorado Springs.

39:31.864 --> 39:34.787
This is her home.
Her... Is this her school?

39:34.870 --> 39:37.542
Yeah. Domestic Arts.
She's a good student.

39:39.922 --> 39:41.049
[chuckles]

39:42.093 --> 39:43.262
Yeah.

39:43.930 --> 39:46.184
What are these? Are these...
What are these names?

39:46.268 --> 39:48.272
They're friendlies
who live in the area.

39:48.355 --> 39:49.525
They took those pictures for me.

39:49.608 --> 39:50.902
What pictures?

39:53.198 --> 39:54.618
[gasps]

39:59.002 --> 40:00.797
Getting her out's impossible.

40:01.214 --> 40:03.093
There's Guardians everywhere.

40:03.761 --> 40:05.347
At least you know
where she is now.

40:07.143 --> 40:10.608
And I'm here...
to do what I can.

40:25.220 --> 40:26.974
You did all this for me.

40:41.419 --> 40:43.508
I should've run away with you
when I had the chance.

40:45.052 --> 40:46.179
Yeah.

40:50.020 --> 40:53.026
We probably should've gone
to that beach in Hawaii.

41:28.681 --> 41:29.850
[Nichole fussing]

41:42.918 --> 41:44.420
Oh, my God.

41:52.436 --> 41:53.856
‐Hi.
‐Here she is.

41:53.940 --> 41:56.194
Hi. Hi. Hi.

41:56.319 --> 41:57.989
Who's that? Hi.

41:58.281 --> 41:59.535
Wanna come say hi?

42:00.787 --> 42:02.373
She's stubborn.

42:03.626 --> 42:04.795
I'm not surprised.

42:04.878 --> 42:06.005
[chuckles]

42:06.089 --> 42:07.424
How dare you.

42:09.011 --> 42:10.807
Oh, I got something. One sec.

42:16.986 --> 42:20.158
Shopping options were limited
in Gilead, but...

42:20.242 --> 42:21.662
[June chuckles]

42:27.924 --> 42:30.345
I thought maybe she could
keep this with her.

42:30.597 --> 42:32.057
[June] Look at that.

42:33.894 --> 42:36.441
Look at that. Thank you.

42:39.322 --> 42:40.867
My beautiful girl.

42:46.336 --> 42:49.342
[June laughs]

42:49.885 --> 42:51.805
[Nichole cooing]

42:53.475 --> 42:56.732
‐Who's this? Um...
‐What is that?

42:56.815 --> 42:59.738
What is that? What is that?

42:59.863 --> 43:02.786
[both laugh]

43:02.911 --> 43:05.165
Mm. What is that?

43:13.891 --> 43:15.310
Keep yourself safe.

43:32.302 --> 43:33.681
Hey, June.

43:40.235 --> 43:41.655
Try and be happy.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.876
[chuckles]

43:50.464 --> 43:51.633
Yeah.

43:55.641 --> 43:56.977
You, too.

44:12.634 --> 44:14.220
‐[Nichole babbling]
‐You okay, sweetie?

45:37.177 --> 45:40.392
[Commander Fred] The ingratitude
and disrespect.

45:40.977 --> 45:42.563
[Serena] It's unconscionable.

45:42.689 --> 45:44.734
[Commander Fred]
It's like they've erased me.

45:45.485 --> 45:47.114
Left me here to rot.

45:47.615 --> 45:49.744
[Serena] God knows
what you've sacrificed.

45:51.330 --> 45:53.919
May He show you His favor
and grant you peace.

45:54.838 --> 45:57.593
Our son's freedom will be
what sustains me.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.312
They could take him away.

46:04.691 --> 46:06.903
Gilead could come for our son.

46:09.366 --> 46:10.911
A mother alone?

46:13.166 --> 46:15.420
They think the baby
belongs to the State.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.301
Naomi said that?

46:18.384 --> 46:20.388
Naomi said,
"Come back to Gilead."

46:20.472 --> 46:22.476
As if I wouldn't
face retribution.

46:26.860 --> 46:28.196
[inhales]

46:28.321 --> 46:30.116
They'd send me to The Colonies.

46:37.297 --> 46:38.926
They could make me a Handmaid.

46:39.928 --> 46:41.765
That's not gonna happen,
I promise.

46:42.975 --> 46:44.353
I'll do everything in my power

46:44.436 --> 46:49.531
to make sure
you and our son are protected.

46:50.783 --> 46:52.160
What power?

46:56.377 --> 46:58.674
What could you
possibly do from in here?

47:05.395 --> 47:06.773
Have faith.

47:12.827 --> 47:16.458
Prepare the new girls
for another inspection.

47:17.169 --> 47:19.674
Their behavior last time
was deplorable.

47:19.757 --> 47:20.968
‐Yeah.
‐[door opens]

47:22.470 --> 47:23.682
[door closes]

47:45.183 --> 47:46.686
Blessed be the fruit.

47:47.479 --> 47:48.815
May the Lord open.

47:52.573 --> 47:54.911
I hope you enjoyed your meal?

47:57.667 --> 47:58.669
Yes,

47:58.752 --> 48:03.010
I am grateful to the Lord
for His bounty, Aunt Lydia.

48:10.985 --> 48:11.987
Praise be.

48:16.203 --> 48:18.583
And praise be to you, my dear,

48:18.667 --> 48:20.921
for your
very valuable assistance.

48:21.881 --> 48:23.301
Thank you, Aunt Lydia.

48:23.802 --> 48:26.265
How lucky we are
to have you with us.

48:27.434 --> 48:29.731
Run along. Get some fresh air.

48:36.619 --> 48:37.621
[chuckles]

48:37.705 --> 48:38.665
[door opens]

48:40.501 --> 48:41.420
[door closes]

48:41.504 --> 48:43.508
To dawdle is an affront to God.

48:43.592 --> 48:46.221
‐Yes, Aunt Lydia.
‐Yes, Aunt Lydia.

49:02.170 --> 49:03.172
Yeah.

49:26.928 --> 49:28.389
[car engine stops]

49:56.028 --> 49:57.280
[chuckles]

50:04.294 --> 50:06.591
[both chuckle]

50:06.674 --> 50:08.512
[Luke] Oh, wow.

50:18.657 --> 50:21.203
So, a success.

50:22.831 --> 50:24.125
I'm happy for you.

50:26.255 --> 50:28.175
Thank you for making it happen.

50:29.887 --> 50:31.724
So... So, what happens next?

50:31.808 --> 50:32.851
How do we get her back?

50:32.935 --> 50:35.941
Yeah, you've got a good man
in Gilead who can help you now.

50:36.024 --> 50:37.151
That's true.

50:37.235 --> 50:40.867
Um, we have a new asset
in Toronto now, too.

50:41.076 --> 50:42.788
He knows how
the system operates.

50:42.871 --> 50:44.291
He could advise us.

50:44.374 --> 50:46.128
Okay. Who is it?

50:47.046 --> 50:48.215
Fred Waterford.

50:54.604 --> 50:55.689
Waterford?

50:56.858 --> 51:00.532
[Mark] He has agreed to, uh,
share his wealth of knowledge.

51:00.991 --> 51:03.495
Inside information about Gilead.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.878
All its top players,
future plans.

51:12.973 --> 51:14.518
Why would he do that?

51:17.315 --> 51:19.069
In exchange for his freedom.

51:20.822 --> 51:22.910
The prosecution has
dropped its charges.

51:23.995 --> 51:24.997
[Luke] What?

51:25.081 --> 51:26.668
[Moira] You made
a deal with him?

51:28.087 --> 51:29.840
That fucking piece of crap?

51:31.719 --> 51:33.598
I understand why you're upset.

51:34.892 --> 51:36.604
Upset? This is fucking bullshit!

51:36.688 --> 51:38.440
So, my testimony spooked him.

51:40.361 --> 51:43.158
And you knew that.

51:43.785 --> 51:47.083
And then you used that
to flip him?

51:48.377 --> 51:51.091
[Mark] You testified so
the world could hear the truth.

51:51.551 --> 51:53.930
[Moira] So, you get your asset,
and he gets to walk.

51:54.013 --> 51:56.268
What kind of fucked‐up
justice is that?

51:57.896 --> 52:00.484
Sometimes, you have to
let one fish go

52:00.569 --> 52:03.240
to catch a lot of
other bigger fish.

52:06.914 --> 52:08.877
Why don't you bring that intel
by my office tomorrow,

52:08.960 --> 52:10.421
we'll go through it together?

52:13.218 --> 52:14.220
See you then.

52:16.517 --> 52:17.770
You fucking believe that?

52:17.853 --> 52:18.855
[door opens]

52:19.982 --> 52:21.109
[door closes]

52:22.613 --> 52:23.615
June.

52:36.808 --> 52:37.893
June!

52:40.314 --> 52:41.399
June!

52:44.322 --> 52:46.326
That man is a fucking rapist!

52:46.828 --> 52:50.167
That man is a fucking rapist,
and you know what he did to me!

52:51.879 --> 52:53.633
‐You know what he did to me!
‐Hey, hey, get off of her!

52:53.842 --> 52:55.094
You know!

52:55.512 --> 52:57.850
You know he's a fucking rapist!

52:57.975 --> 53:00.145
You know what he did
to those women!

53:00.229 --> 53:01.607
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

53:01.732 --> 53:03.778
You know what he did
to all of us!

53:03.862 --> 53:05.072
I will kill you!

53:05.239 --> 53:07.536
I will kill you!
