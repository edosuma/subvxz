you that time was of the essence.

04:33.211 --> 04:36.079
Unfortunately your delay means

04:36.104 --> 04:38.769
that it's too late to be

04:39.836 --> 04:43.961
Because of the size of the tumour,
your only chance at surviving

05:14.651 --> 05:16.918
I think Ferguson planted it on me.

05:17.478 --> 05:18.945
Why would she do that?

05:18.970 --> 05:21.878
Well someone did, and
she doesn't like me.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.391
It wasn't her she's one of us.

05:24.416 --> 05:27.555
I'm starting to see that Bea Smith
and Jackson could have stitched her up.

05:33.788 --> 05:34.988
Are you okay?

05:35.327 --> 05:37.337
I just don't see why you trust her.

05:37.362 --> 05:39.204
Because there's another side to her.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.164

- Oh, now look what you've done!

12:07.189 --> 12:09.403
- She's spooked now.
- I gotta call Nash.

12:09.428 --> 12:10.774
- No!
- Sit down!

12:10.996 --> 12:13.317

make you paranoid.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.249
You break the rules, you pay for it.

13:46.274 --> 13:49.555
She was just trying to stop herself
from getting raped for Christ's sake.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.027
Her hair will grow back.

13:52.428 --> 13:56.089
I think this stupid system of
punishing laggers has gotten ridiculous.

13:56.304 --> 13:57.745
- Really?
- Really.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.517
I think sometimes you have
to tell the truth. Right, Liz?

14:02.523 --> 14:06.291
Could have been worse love. She
could have had her hands burnt.

14:06.315 --> 14:09.680

permanent damage. I prevented that.

for her so just...

settles in and learns the ropes. Okay?

14:21.035 --> 14:22.322
Sure. (sighs)

Dunno.

would never have burnt me hands, eh?

14:48.824 --> 14:52.023
Hey, Liz told me you were in
Medical, where have you been?

14:52.258 --> 14:55.074

keeping this to myself.

14:55.781 --> 14:57.039

Good.

14:59.318 --> 15:00.518
What happens next?

15:00.543 --> 15:02.549

the options at the moment.

- (chuckles) I don't really

15:04.411 --> 15:05.981

Fine. (tsks)

You were supposed to sort her out.

15:16.570 --> 15:17.770
What?

15:17.795 --> 15:19.283
Oh, Jesus, Maxine.

15:19.490 --> 15:23.161
I asked you to step up to keep
order, not play Mrs Nice Guy.

15:23.404 --> 15:25.351
I'm sorry but I didn't
think it would do any harm

15:25.376 --> 15:26.661
- if I let her off with a warning.
- Oh, yeah?

15:26.686 --> 15:29.066

blood, so I had to do something

15:49.127 --> 15:51.004
the incident in the yard this afternoon,

15:51.029 --> 15:52.703
I reckon the women
are punishing that girl

15:52.729 --> 15:54.232
because she pushed the panic button.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.404
Yes. They see it as lagging.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.971
- But it's not right though, is it?
- That's their system.

16:00.550 --> 16:01.750
Well...

16:01.775 --> 16:05.226
in the male prison the inmates
sort out their problems one-on-one.

16:05.446 --> 16:08.579
Here, they're like a pack. All
barking to the Top Dog's tune.

16:08.604 --> 16:10.537
Now, I'm suggesting we unpick that.

16:10.562 --> 16:11.919
Well, there can be a virtue,

16:11.944 --> 16:14.299
having a leader who keeps
the women under control.

16:14.324 --> 16:17.900
Bea Smith, for example, has a
very strong anti-drug stance.

16:17.925 --> 16:20.347

They've taken her to psych unit.

35:04.774 --> 35:06.571

I wouldn't have known what to do.

Some of them think Bea should
never have punished Tasha.

35:27.598 --> 35:30.897

none of this would have happened.

35:42.614 --> 35:45.369
Oh gee, you don't want Bea
to hear you talking like that.

35:45.394 --> 35:48.292

think about it, Maxie.

35:58.266 --> 36:00.146

- Because I have cancer.
