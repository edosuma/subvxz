She sought comfort with me.

it was just a one-night stand.

Can I talk to you?

15:47.239 --> 15:49.730
Graham? What's the matter?
Are you okay?

15:49.825 --> 15:52.988
I think we know each other.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.068
Of course we do.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.822
No, no, no, not from here.
Not from Storybrooke.

From where, then?

You're a tortured one,
aren't you, Huntsman?

16:34.703 --> 16:38.662
Is this because your parents
abandoned you to the wolves?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.158
Those weren't my parents.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.411
All they did was give birth to me.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.958
The wolves are my family.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.212
Wolves, indeed.

16:49.551 --> 16:52.918
I always felt
there were two kinds of people.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.897
you are most certainly a wolf.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.603
Why am I here?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.606
I'd like you to kill someone for me.
Can you do that?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.689
I kill for me.
Why would I do anything for you?

17:13.783 --> 17:16.445
Because I have so much to offer.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.904

17:20.874 --> 17:23.490

17:35.597 --> 17:38.760

who won't be blinded by that.

have we known each other?

18:42.664 --> 18:46.156

He has this book of stories.

we're all characters from them,

19:37.385 --> 19:39.296
from another land,

19:39.679 --> 19:42.466
and we've forgotten who we really are.

31:10.828 --> 31:14.195
"allowing you to rule my father’s
subjects as they deserve,

31:14.290 --> 31:16.576
"with compassion and a gentle hand.

31:17.126 --> 31:19.617
"/ know what you think you’re doing

31:19.712 --> 31:23.330
"/ prefer to think of it as sacriﬁce

"With that in mind, / welcome the end,

"and / want you to take
my last message to heart.

31:30.014 --> 31:32.926
"I'm sorry, and I forgive you."

31:41.192 --> 31:43.854
Don't tell me you're becoming a sheep.

31:44.445 --> 31:47.903
She put others before herself
and yet you hate her.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.485
What did she do to you?

31:50.576 --> 31:53.158
I shared a secret with her

31:53.245 --> 31:55.861
and she couldn't keep it.

31:56.248 --> 32:00.617
And that betrayal cost me clearly.

32:03.714 --> 32:04.703
Now,

32:07.301 --> 32:09.633
show me her heart!

32:51.971 --> 32:53.632
It should open.

33:04.358 --> 33:05.689
This isn't her heart!

33:07.153 --> 33:09.269
This isn't a human heart!

33:09.363 --> 33:11.524
What did you do?

33:14.910 --> 33:16.411
It's gotta be in here.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.201
Somewhere.

33:23.711 --> 33:27.750
There's gotta be a hidden door.
(GRUNTS) A lever.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.755
(GRAHAM GRUNTING)

33:36.724 --> 33:37.679
Something.

33:37.766 --> 33:40.098
Graham. Hey, Graham.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.267
There's nothing in here.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.730
There has to be.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.554
-If there isn't, then...
-It's okay.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.935
It's going to be okay.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.568
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

33:55.075 --> 33:56.531
What are you doing here?

33:56.619 --> 34:00.032
Bringing flowers to my father's grave
like I do every Wednesday.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.202
GRAHAM: Don't blame her.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.532
It's my fault. I wanted to look in there.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.288
Really? Why?

34:06.921 --> 34:08.331
What were you looking for?

34:08.756 --> 34:09.791
Nothing.

34:11.342 --> 34:13.708
It was nothing.

34:14.762 --> 34:16.252
You don't look well, dear.

34:17.765 --> 34:18.845
Let's take you home.

34:18.933 --> 34:21.015
I don't wanna go home.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.388
Not with you.

34:24.688 --> 34:25.723
Oh?

34:26.440 --> 34:27.520
But you'll go with her?

34:27.608 --> 34:30.850
Hey, this is between you two.
Leave me out of it.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.232
She's right. It's between us,

34:34.323 --> 34:35.688
and things have to change.

34:35.783 --> 34:37.489
And I wonder why that is,
all of a sudden.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.986
GRAHAM: It has nothing to do with her.

34:39.078 --> 34:42.821
I've realized that
I don't feel anything, Regina.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.952
And I know now it's not me, it's you.

34:46.669 --> 34:48.705
So you're leaving me for her?

34:49.129 --> 34:50.665
I'm leaving you for me.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.336
Graham, you're not thinking straight.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.884
Actually for the first time, I am.

34:57.972 --> 35:00.384
I'd rather have nothing
than settle for less.

35:00.474 --> 35:03.557
Nothing is better than what we have.

35:03.644 --> 35:05.555
I need to feel something, Regina,

35:05.646 --> 35:08.934
and the only way to do that
is to give myself a chance.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.685
-Graham.
-I'm sorry.

35:12.569 --> 35:13.729
It's over.

35:17.241 --> 35:21.154
I don't know what I ever did to you,
Miss Swan, to deserve this.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.907
To have you keep coming after
everything I hold dear.

35:23.998 --> 35:25.363
I told you, it's not her.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.914
None of this happened
until she got here.

35:28.002 --> 35:28.957
EMMA: I'm sorry.

35:29.044 --> 35:32.582
You ever stop to think that maybe the
problem isn't with me, but with you?

35:32.673 --> 35:33.913
Excuse me?

35:34.300 --> 35:36.712
Henry came and found me.

35:37.052 --> 35:40.419
Graham kissed me.

35:40.514 --> 35:41.924
Both were miserable.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.890
Maybe, Madam Mayor,

35:46.020 --> 35:47.681
you need to take a good,
hard look in the mirror

35:47.771 --> 35:49.932
and ask yourself why that is.

35:50.024 --> 35:52.731
Why is everyone
running away from you?

35:56.363 --> 35:58.069
-(EMMA GRUNTS)
-GRAHAM: Regina!

36:03.078 --> 36:04.193
Stop!

36:05.539 --> 36:08.201
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

36:18.135 --> 36:19.966
Not worth it.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.101
REGINA: Graham?

36:47.790 --> 36:49.701
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.666
I don't know what came over me.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.497
How I lost my mind.

36:58.592 --> 36:59.672
It's okay.

37:00.094 --> 37:02.130
You were tired and feverish.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.260
And heartbroken.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.598
I don't know why I let myself
get caught up with her.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.726
Because it was easy and safe.

37:13.732 --> 37:17.350
Not feeling anything's an attractive
option when what you feel sucks.

37:27.621 --> 37:28.952
(INHALES SHARPLY)

37:30.124 --> 37:31.113
Felt that.

38:19.089 --> 38:22.047
Did you think you can fool me
with the heart of a stag?

38:27.598 --> 38:29.429
You're not going anywhere.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.222
She doesn't deserve to die.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.926
That's not up to you.

38:34.396 --> 38:35.977
I wanted a heart,

38:36.064 --> 38:38.100
and a heart I shall have.

What are you going to do to me?

38:55.000 --> 38:58.584
You're now mine. My pet.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.798
From this moment fonNard,

39:08.889 --> 39:11.130
you will do everything that I say.

39:11.475 --> 39:13.761
And if you ever disobey me,

39:14.228 --> 39:16.560
if you ever try to run away,

39:16.647 --> 39:19.730
all I have to do is squeeze.
