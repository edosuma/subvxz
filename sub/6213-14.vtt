Canola oil.

Eye of newt.

No, it's... "Eye of newt."

Hermia Von Bieberstein.

Or is it "stine?"

00:29.095 --> 00:30.896
WOMAN:
It's wrong,
is what it is.

00:30.896 --> 00:33.366
It was I.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.700
Aunt Irma.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.937
I rode a large brazil nut.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.806
Perhaps <i>you</i> could replace
Hildie as my partner.

00:40.806 --> 00:42.642
With your amazing intelligence

00:42.642 --> 00:45.011
we could wipe the floor
with those two.

00:45.011 --> 00:45.878
Silence, fleatrap.

00:45.878 --> 00:46.979
I didn't come here

00:46.979 --> 00:48.214
to play games.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.949
I came to see my favorite niece.

00:49.949 --> 00:51.283
Why, thank you, Aunt Irma.

00:51.283 --> 00:52.685
I was talking about Sabrina.

00:52.685 --> 00:56.255
Dear, have you given
any thought to your future?

00:56.255 --> 00:58.524
Well, yes, as you know,
I'm a journalism major

00:58.524 --> 01:00.026
and one day,
I hope...
Silence!

01:00.026 --> 01:02.795
I've found an eligible
young witch in the Other Realm

01:02.795 --> 01:04.430
who's going to be
your husband.

01:04.430 --> 01:05.331
What?!

01:05.331 --> 01:06.599
Aunt Irma

01:06.599 --> 01:08.567
we don't do arranged
marriages in this realm.

01:08.567 --> 01:09.802
Or this century.

01:09.802 --> 01:15.207
Oh, you don't, do you?

01:15.207 --> 01:16.742
However, if you
picked him out

01:16.742 --> 01:17.877
I'm sure
he's lovely.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.845
And charming.
Just like you.

01:19.845 --> 01:21.881
I thought
you'd see it my way.

01:21.881 --> 01:25.351
I'll send him by tomorrow.

01:25.351 --> 01:26.786
An arranged marriage?

01:26.786 --> 01:29.055
How could you sell
me out like that?

01:29.055 --> 01:31.057
It was you
or the omelet pan.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.159
Nice choice.

Now, whose roll is it?

02:19.205 --> 02:21.073
Honey, don't worry.

02:21.073 --> 02:23.342
We're not going to let
Aunt Irma marry you off.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.111
We just have to play her game

02:25.111 --> 02:26.312
for a little while.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.980
Make her think
her opinion counts.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.348
All you have to do
is meet the guy.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.683
Go out with him
a couple of times.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.084
But I have a boyfriend

02:32.084 --> 02:34.587
and Josh doesn't really
like me to date.

02:34.587 --> 02:36.555
This will all be over
before you know it.

02:36.555 --> 02:39.058
Aunt Irma will find someone
else's life to meddle in

02:39.058 --> 02:40.659
and she'll forget all about you.

02:40.659 --> 02:42.628
What makes you so sure
she'll lose interest?

02:42.628 --> 02:44.330
Experience.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.099
Aunt Irma tried to
marry off Hilda and
me countless times.

02:47.099 --> 02:48.768
She gave up on
us centuries ago.

02:48.768 --> 02:51.203
As did every man in both realms.

02:51.203 --> 02:54.373
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Oh!

02:54.373 --> 02:56.742
Let me guess. You've
become a cat burglar?

02:56.742 --> 02:59.612
Guess again.
I've signed up for a class.

02:59.612 --> 03:02.848
23 live,
long-legged ladies and me.

03:02.848 --> 03:04.083
And this class is what?

03:04.083 --> 03:05.918
Intro to Delusions
and Fantasies?

03:05.918 --> 03:11.457
Ballet, which in my case
may be the same thing.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.793
( <i>door opens and closes</i> )

03:13.793 --> 03:15.795
Oh, where'd these
come from?

03:15.795 --> 03:17.763
MAN:
Me.

03:17.763 --> 03:18.964
Hi, Sabrina.

03:18.964 --> 03:21.734
I'm Peter.
Your Aunt Irma sent me.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.402
Oh, I won't hold that
against you.

03:23.402 --> 03:24.937
Look, I'm sure you're
a really nice guy...

03:24.937 --> 03:26.172
I'm sure you're nice, too.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.406
But I have to be honest
with you.

03:27.406 --> 03:28.641
BOTH:
I don't want to marry you.

03:28.641 --> 03:29.575
Really?

03:29.575 --> 03:30.876
This is great.

03:30.876 --> 03:32.344
Oh, I only agreed
to meet you

03:32.344 --> 03:33.679
to get Aunt Irma
off my back.

03:33.679 --> 03:35.447
Tell me about it.
She said if I
didn't meet you

03:35.447 --> 03:37.049
she'd turn me into
a dung beetle.

03:37.049 --> 03:40.686
Wow, I'm flattered.
Look, until the smoke clears

03:40.686 --> 03:42.121
let's just tell Aunt Irma
we're dating.

03:42.121 --> 03:43.889
But we can't actually date,
because I have a boyfriend.

03:43.889 --> 03:44.857
Oh, that works for me.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.458
Sabrina, have you seen
my black tights?

03:46.458 --> 03:47.827
I've looked everywhere for them.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.328
They couldn't have just
walked away.

03:49.328 --> 03:50.696
Don't be so sure.

03:50.696 --> 03:53.065
It's like you finally find
a pair that fits, and... Hi!

03:53.065 --> 03:54.266
Hi.

03:54.266 --> 03:56.368
Oh, Roxie, this is Peter.
Peter, Roxie.

03:56.368 --> 03:58.404
He's an old
family friend.
Hi.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.138
Hi.

03:59.138 --> 04:01.040
Hi.
Hi.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.808
Okay, well, that about
covers introductions.

04:02.808 --> 04:04.577
Roxie, aren't you late
for class?
Hi.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.177
Bye.

04:05.177 --> 04:06.412
Bye.

04:06.412 --> 04:12.685
Bye.

04:12.685 --> 04:13.586
Who was that?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.221
Oh, therapists have been trying

04:15.221 --> 04:17.056
to solve that mystery
for 19 years.

04:17.056 --> 04:20.059
Well, I'm glad
you and I have this
situation under control.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.962
You know, maybe we can <i>not</i>
go out next Wednesday night.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.563
Perfect.
I <i>won't</i> pick you up at 7:00.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.232
Okay.
See you.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.700
Or not.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.767
( <i>chuckles</i> )

04:28.767 --> 04:29.902
Hi.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.036
Hi.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.171
First of all,
I want you to know

04:32.171 --> 04:34.673
I have other words
in my vocabulary
besides "hi."

04:34.673 --> 04:37.209
I figured. I'm guessing you're
a woman who speaks her mind

04:37.209 --> 04:38.911
and doesn't let anyone
push her around.

04:38.911 --> 04:40.346
And I'm guessing
you're pretty smart

04:40.346 --> 04:41.547
if you got all
that from "hi."

04:41.547 --> 04:42.848
( <i>chuckles</i> )

04:42.848 --> 04:45.084
You know, I've never done
anything like this before

04:45.084 --> 04:48.420
but would you ever maybe
want to go out with me?

04:48.420 --> 04:50.356
I'm hoping
that's a "yes."

04:50.356 --> 04:53.525
I've always loved the dance,
but from afar.

04:53.525 --> 04:55.828
I wanted to get closer
to the process.

04:55.828 --> 04:58.664
So, which dancers
do you admire most?

04:58.664 --> 05:01.800
I'd have to say...
Rudolf Nureyev

05:01.800 --> 05:05.004
and Celtic Cheerleader
Number Six.

05:05.004 --> 05:07.206
Miles' dance class
seems to be working out.

05:07.206 --> 05:10.009
Oh, man, I should have taken
a dance class in college.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.278
I could have met tons
of hot-looking dance...

05:12.278 --> 05:14.213
<i>education</i> specialists.

05:14.213 --> 05:15.381
Bye.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.117
Hmm.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.920
Oh, no. Aunt Hilda,
did you see who Roxie
just walked in with?

05:20.920 --> 05:23.589
That's Peter! That's
the guy Aunt Irma
wants me to marry!

05:23.589 --> 05:26.258
Wow. You're lucky.

05:26.258 --> 05:27.793
Wow. Roxie's lucky.

05:27.793 --> 05:29.828
Oh, no, if Aunt Irma
finds out about this

05:29.828 --> 05:31.230
she's going to be furious.

05:31.230 --> 05:32.464
Honey, calm down.

05:32.464 --> 05:34.066
This is Roxie
we're talking about.

05:34.066 --> 05:35.801
She's a walking man-repellent.

05:35.801 --> 05:37.603
They'll be broken up
by dessert.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.571
See for yourself.

05:39.571 --> 05:40.839
Dessert?

05:40.839 --> 05:42.908
No, thank you.
I've already got mine.

05:42.908 --> 05:45.344
Oh, that is so cute.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.480
This relationship
must be destroyed.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.584
Well, the good news is

05:52.584 --> 05:55.321
Peter and Roxie make
an adorable couple.

05:55.321 --> 05:56.555
Yeah, the bad news is

05:56.555 --> 05:58.791
Peter and Roxie make
an adorable couple.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.126
( <i>phone rings</i> )

06:01.126 --> 06:03.696
Oh, hi, Aunt Irma.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.297
Well, let's just say

06:05.297 --> 06:08.734
Peter has found
the ideal woman.

06:08.734 --> 06:10.069
Bye-bye.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.805
Aunt Zelda,
what are we going to do?

06:12.805 --> 06:13.872
I've got it.

06:13.872 --> 06:15.240
I'm going to
distract Aunt Irma

06:15.240 --> 06:17.142
by getting her to fix
up Cousin Desperada.

06:17.142 --> 06:19.979
And you're going to do
whatever it takes to
break up those two.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.381
Yeah, that should be easy.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.983
Got a crowbar?

06:24.717 --> 06:26.752
Wow, you look amazing.

06:26.752 --> 06:27.920
Where are <i>you</i> going?

06:27.920 --> 06:29.688
Peter's taking me to
Umberto's for dinner.

06:29.688 --> 06:30.689
Speaking of Peter

06:30.689 --> 06:31.991
are you sure
he's right for you?

06:31.991 --> 06:33.993
I mean, I know he's
a really nice guy and all...

06:33.993 --> 06:35.761
He's a great guy.
Yeah, yeah, great.

06:35.761 --> 06:37.296
But aren't things moving
a little fast?

06:37.296 --> 06:39.264
It's almost like
you're boyfriend and girlfriend.

06:39.264 --> 06:41.100
Sabrina, we <i>are</i> boyfriend
and girlfriend.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.569
See?
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

06:43.569 --> 06:44.336
Hi.

06:44.336 --> 06:44.970
Hi.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.139
Hi.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.908
Not a real verbal relationship.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.178
Sabrina, tell me again

06:53.178 --> 06:54.913
why I have tickets
to a basketball game

06:54.913 --> 06:56.615
but I'm in a snotty
French restaurant?

06:56.615 --> 06:58.951
Because you love me.
And I drove.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.986
Couldn't you have left
your finger in the car?

07:00.986 --> 07:03.222
Are you nuts? You think I'm
going to leave something

07:03.222 --> 07:05.124
like this for the valet
to get his hands on?

07:05.124 --> 07:06.492
Can I check
your finger?

07:06.492 --> 07:07.659
Back off, Pierre.

07:07.659 --> 07:09.795
Oh, you know,
I see my friends over there.

07:09.795 --> 07:10.996
Why don't we join them?

07:10.996 --> 07:12.331
Hey, I still
don't understand

07:12.331 --> 07:14.566
why I have to get involved
in their relationship.

07:14.566 --> 07:15.834
Again, because
you love me.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.336
And the sooner
we break them up

07:17.336 --> 07:18.837
the sooner you
get to the game.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.239
They're history.
Mm-hmm.

07:20.239 --> 07:21.740
Hi, Roxie.
Hi, Peter.
Hey.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.243
What a coincidence!
Mind if we join you?

07:24.243 --> 07:25.511
Well, actually...

07:25.511 --> 07:27.346
You know, we were going
to get our own table

07:27.346 --> 07:28.414
but it is so
much more fun

07:28.414 --> 07:29.782
to hang out in
a group, you know?

07:29.782 --> 07:32.885
Romantic dinners for
two can be <i>so</i> boring.

07:32.885 --> 07:33.585
What are you
talking about?

07:33.585 --> 07:33.952
You and Josh

07:33.952 --> 07:35.687
go out for romantic dinners
all the time.

07:35.687 --> 07:37.156
Yeah, but we
don't enjoy it.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.091
What do you mean,
we don't enjoy it?

07:39.091 --> 07:40.959
I mean, we don't enjoy it
as much as if we were out

07:40.959 --> 07:43.796
with a big group
of people cheering

07:43.796 --> 07:45.330
waving big foam body parts.

07:45.330 --> 07:46.665
You know,
college is a time

07:46.665 --> 07:48.367
when you should
meet lots of people

07:48.367 --> 07:50.035
not get too serious,
right, Josh?

07:50.035 --> 07:51.136
Right.
Yeah, otherwise

07:51.136 --> 07:53.005
you're just
like some old,
married couple.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.240
( <i>old man's voice</i> ):
"Hey, Edna,
pass the cream."

07:55.240 --> 07:55.908
( <i>old woman's voice):</i>
"Cream?

07:55.908 --> 07:57.643
With your cholesterol?"

07:57.643 --> 07:59.545
I don't want to date
other people.

07:59.545 --> 08:00.646
I like Roxie.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.747
And I like
Peter.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.082
And I like
Sabrina.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.150
But I like
other women, too.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.318
Lots of them

08:06.318 --> 08:08.087
and I'd like
to date them.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.354
All of them.

08:09.354 --> 08:11.390
You would?
Of course.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.758
Hey, I saw this
gorgeous redhead

08:12.758 --> 08:14.760
in the quad
the other day...
Oh, what redhead?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.529
Well, I don't know her name,
but she had this amazing smile

08:17.529 --> 08:19.631
and legs that
went on for days.

08:19.631 --> 08:21.233
Really? That long, huh?

08:21.233 --> 08:22.234
Yeah, they were

08:22.234 --> 08:23.435
kind of hard to miss
since she

08:23.435 --> 08:24.937
was wearing
this tight leather skirt.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.406
You know, we were supposed
to be breaking <i>them</i> up, not us.

08:27.406 --> 08:30.109
Hey, I'm just agreeing
with your idea that guys our age

08:30.109 --> 08:31.810
shouldn't tie themselves down,
right, Peter?

08:31.810 --> 08:33.512
Oh, great, they're gone.

08:33.512 --> 08:34.913
Now we're really
in big trouble.

08:34.913 --> 08:37.282
Yeah, you're not kidding.
We got stuck with the bill.

08:37.282 --> 08:39.251
Check, please.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.487
Roxie, there you are.

08:41.487 --> 08:43.689
Listen, I really
have to talk to
you about Peter.

08:43.689 --> 08:46.792
I mean, I know you
like him, but he's
all wrong for you.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.293
He's weird.
He's out there.

08:48.293 --> 08:49.795
He's my fiancé.
I don't believe it.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.964
Neither did I.
Who would have thought I'd be

08:51.964 --> 08:54.099
the first one in this house
to get engaged?

08:54.099 --> 08:55.968
Well, you're too young
to get married.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.669
Uh, you're still in college.

08:57.669 --> 08:59.204
And I can stay
in college.

08:59.204 --> 09:01.006
Hey, you're happy
for me, right?

09:01.006 --> 09:03.108
Well, I do feel like crying.

09:03.108 --> 09:04.443
Congratulations.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.544
I'm going upstairs.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.179
Morgan wants to take
a closer look

09:07.179 --> 09:08.514
through her
jeweler's loupe.

09:08.514 --> 09:10.215
She's praying it's
cubic zirconium.

09:10.883 --> 09:16.221
I sure hope my aunts
are still up.

09:16.221 --> 09:17.256
Aunt Irma!

09:17.256 --> 09:18.957
Hello, dear,
I just thought I'd pop in

09:18.957 --> 09:20.726
and see how you were doing
with Peter.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.561
Peter? Uh, very well.

09:22.561 --> 09:24.663
I was...
just with him at dinner.

09:24.663 --> 09:26.565
Well, I was talking
to his mother

09:26.565 --> 09:28.767
and she told me
that he's been spending

09:28.767 --> 09:30.702
all his time
in the Mortal Realm.

09:30.702 --> 09:34.773
<i>And</i> he told her that
he'd met a very special woman.

09:34.773 --> 09:35.774
Oh, he has.

09:35.774 --> 09:36.675
Don't brag, dear.

09:36.675 --> 09:37.876
I'm not.
Believe me.

09:37.876 --> 09:40.345
I presume I'll be hearing
wedding bells soon?

09:40.345 --> 09:42.414
It's been discussed.

09:42.414 --> 09:44.983
Oh, happy day!

09:44.983 --> 09:48.954
Oh, I knew the two
of you would be
perfect together.

09:48.954 --> 09:51.456
Two great witch
families united.

09:51.456 --> 09:53.158
Yeah, a dream come true.

09:53.158 --> 09:54.126
But just out
of curiosity

09:54.126 --> 09:56.428
what if Peter fell
out of love

09:56.428 --> 09:57.930
with me and decided

09:57.930 --> 10:00.966
to marry someone else,
say... a mortal?

10:00.966 --> 10:04.203
If Peter were to marry a mortal,
I would banish him

10:04.203 --> 10:07.172
and he would never see
his mortal bride again.

10:07.172 --> 10:11.476
And I would condemn her
to a life of misery.

10:11.476 --> 10:13.879
But we don't have to worry
about that, do we, dear?

10:13.879 --> 10:18.450
Because Peter's marrying <i>you!</i>

10:24.324 --> 10:26.024
Aunt Hilda,
Aunt Zelda?

10:26.024 --> 10:27.459
Oh, I've got
the worst news.

10:27.459 --> 10:28.927
Roxie and Peter
are engaged!

10:28.927 --> 10:30.529
As bad as
that news is

10:30.529 --> 10:32.798
I believe your Aunt Zelda
can trump that.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.066
Oh, no.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.668
It says I'm marrying Peter
at 3:00 on Saturday

10:36.668 --> 10:39.605
and I have to choose
my entree by 4:00 yesterday?

10:39.605 --> 10:42.908
On the bright side,
you're registered at
Bed, Bath and Way Beyond.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.876
How could you let
this happen?

10:44.876 --> 10:46.578
Honey, it took us
by total surprise.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.180
The invitation came
from Aunt Irma.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.182
She must have heard that
Peter got engaged

10:50.182 --> 10:51.650
and assumed
you were the bride.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.218
I can't be a bride.

10:53.218 --> 10:56.888
A) I don't love the groom,
and B) I don't have a dress.

10:56.888 --> 10:59.625
How would you feel
about <i>me</i> officiating?

10:59.625 --> 11:01.393
I am an ordained minister

11:01.393 --> 11:03.729
of the Nine Lives
Universal Church.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.197
There isn't going
to be any wedding.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.465
Peter doesn't want to marry me

11:06.465 --> 11:07.899
any more than
I want to marry him.

11:07.899 --> 11:10.869
Then why is he having
a bachelor party tonight?

11:10.869 --> 11:12.004
A bachelor party?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.805
At the Other Realm Hooters.

11:13.805 --> 11:16.208
Got to go.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.510
Yeah, I was invited,
but I blew it off.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.479
You had a chance
to go to Hooters

11:20.479 --> 11:21.813
and you blew it off?

11:21.813 --> 11:24.583
The Other Realm Hooters
isn't nearly as popular

11:24.583 --> 11:25.651
as the ones here.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.052
Why not?

11:27.052 --> 11:29.354
( <i>whooping, cheering )</i>

11:29.354 --> 11:31.290
All right, Petey boy.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.091
Your single days
you will forsake.

11:33.091 --> 11:33.792
But wait till you see what

11:33.792 --> 11:36.695
jumps out
of this cake.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.497
Hey, you're
not an owl.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.232
( <i>all booing</i> )

11:40.232 --> 11:41.633
Excuse me,
I need some private time

11:41.633 --> 11:44.369
with the groom.

11:44.369 --> 11:45.037
Look, why are you

11:45.037 --> 11:46.238
having a bachelor party?

11:46.238 --> 11:47.673
I'm not marrying you
on Saturday.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.641
I know that.
I'm marrying Roxie.

11:49.641 --> 11:51.243
Does Aunt Irma
know that?
No.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.211
Does Roxie know that?
No.

11:53.211 --> 11:55.714
Well,I thought I'd
break the news to them
right after the party.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.015
Oh yeah,that'll go
over big.

11:57.015 --> 11:59.318
Look, Aunt Irma told me
that if you marry a mortal

11:59.318 --> 12:00.385
she'll banish you

12:00.385 --> 12:01.853
and make Roxie
miserable forever.

12:01.853 --> 12:03.555
Well,that's because she
hasn't met Roxie.

12:03.555 --> 12:04.856
Once Irma gets to know her

12:04.856 --> 12:07.392
she's going to fall in love
with her just like I did.

12:07.392 --> 12:08.627
Alright lay off
the owl juice, buddy.

12:08.627 --> 12:09.995
It ain't going
to happen.

12:09.995 --> 12:11.897
Besides, you can't just
tell Roxie you're a witch

12:11.897 --> 12:13.231
and expect her
to roll with it.

12:13.231 --> 12:14.800
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.467
I'll go tell
her right now.

12:15.467 --> 12:16.902
No, wait. I can't
let you talk to Roxie.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.036
Why not?

12:18.036 --> 12:20.806
Because in the Mortal Realm, uh
once you get engaged

12:20.806 --> 12:22.941
you can't see the bride
or talk to her

12:22.941 --> 12:24.009
until the wedding.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.677
Doesn't she have
to know when

12:25.677 --> 12:26.678
the wedding is?

12:26.678 --> 12:28.146
Yeah, but that's the
bridesmaid's job

12:28.146 --> 12:29.181
and that's me.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.515
What about telling
her I'm a witch?

12:30.515 --> 12:32.017
Again, the bridesmaid.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.285
How is she going
to get to the--

12:33.285 --> 12:34.886
Other Realm.
Again,that's my responsibility

12:34.886 --> 12:37.289
along with the flowers
and the finger food
for the reception.

12:37.289 --> 12:40.959
Boy, the bridesmaids
really have a lot to do.

12:40.959 --> 12:41.626
Yeah, I know.

12:41.626 --> 12:42.394
And we have to do it all

12:42.394 --> 12:43.862
while wearing a really
ugly dress.

12:43.862 --> 12:45.197
Peter, get away from her.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.765
It's time for
your flap dance.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.800
Whoa, don't you mean lap
dance?

12:48.800 --> 12:50.569
No.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.744
Okay, now I see why this isn't
quite as popular

12:58.744 --> 13:02.147
as the Hooters back home.

13:02.147 --> 13:03.849
( <i>Miles groaning</i> )

13:03.849 --> 13:05.450
Miles, what are
you doing?

13:05.450 --> 13:06.718
Oh, thank God
you're home.

13:06.718 --> 13:09.020
My hamstring has been
stuck in this position

13:09.020 --> 13:10.021
for three hours.

13:10.021 --> 13:11.356
( <i>yelling in pain</i> )

13:11.356 --> 13:12.958
Miles, could you
stop the groaning?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.025
It's getting annoying.

13:14.025 --> 13:15.127
Roxie, you were here?

13:15.127 --> 13:16.895
How come you didn't
come out to help me?

13:16.895 --> 13:17.896
I just thought you
were talking

13:17.896 --> 13:19.398
to your mother.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.665
Sabrina, does Peter
have his cell phone?

13:20.665 --> 13:21.733
I tried calling
him at home

13:21.733 --> 13:23.034
but I got this
weird recording.

13:23.034 --> 13:25.704
Oh, must be something
with the switchboard.

13:25.704 --> 13:28.039
It's probably nothing
to worry about.

13:28.039 --> 13:29.708
Yeah,well, I may have
something to worry about.

13:29.708 --> 13:30.976
Not being able
to have children.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.412
You know, not only
could I not reach him

13:33.412 --> 13:36.214
but I realized
I have no idea
where he lives.

13:36.214 --> 13:38.016
Let's examine that.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.418
You're engaged
to this guy

13:39.418 --> 13:41.386
yet you have no idea
where he lives.

13:41.386 --> 13:42.988
Does that tell
you something?

13:42.988 --> 13:46.925
I must really love him.

13:46.925 --> 13:48.960
Not the answer
I was going for.

13:51.696 --> 13:52.931
Come on, guys, hurry up.

13:52.931 --> 13:55.167
We don't want to be late
for Roxie and Peter's wedding.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.269
How did you ever get
everyone to agree to this?

13:57.269 --> 13:58.904
Well, Roxie and Peter
are madly in love

13:58.904 --> 13:59.905
so that was easy.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.406
How did you convince
Aunt Irma?

14:01.406 --> 14:02.441
It was a snap.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.409
I am her favorite niece.

14:05.677 --> 14:07.446
( <i>imitating Sabrina</i> ):
"I am her favorite niece."

14:07.746 --> 14:09.881
Two minutes before
the wedding--
perfect timing.

14:09.881 --> 14:10.982
We can get to our seats

14:10.982 --> 14:12.451
without having
to make small talk

14:12.451 --> 14:13.685
with that
evil Aunt Irma.

14:13.685 --> 14:17.022
Hilda, Zelda, always
bridesmaids, never brides.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.891
Actually, not even
bridesmaids this time.

14:19.891 --> 14:21.726
Nice to see you, too.

14:21.726 --> 14:23.295
Well, it's a glorious day.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.764
And I can't think
of a more perfect match

14:25.764 --> 14:27.432
for Peter than our Sabrina.

14:27.432 --> 14:28.433
Sabrina?

14:28.433 --> 14:29.434
You mean Roxie.

14:29.434 --> 14:30.569
Roxie?

14:30.569 --> 14:32.304
Is that Sabrina's nickname?

14:32.304 --> 14:33.672
Yes.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.273
Yes. We gave her
that name

14:35.273 --> 14:36.475
because as a child

14:36.475 --> 14:38.243
she used to play
with rocks.

14:38.243 --> 14:41.480
I always forget how dim you are.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.282
Let's get to
the bottom of this.

14:46.651 --> 14:48.353
Sabrina, trouble.

14:48.353 --> 14:50.956
Aunt Irma still thinks
you're the one marrying Peter.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.158
I know, but I've got it all
under control.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.293
Tell the truth-- you never
really told her, did you?

14:55.293 --> 14:57.963
I thought you were
her favorite niece.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.064
Don't worry.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.532
The ceremony's going
to be beautiful

15:00.532 --> 15:02.100
and everybody will be
moved to tears.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.835
Then Aunt Irma will see
how madly in love

15:03.835 --> 15:05.570
the bride and groom are
and she'll melt.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.806
Or she could have a fit
and start throwing thunderbolts.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.608
And with the amount
of hair spray I have on

15:09.608 --> 15:11.009
I could go up like
a roman candle.

15:11.009 --> 15:12.978
Look, just keep Aunt Irma
away from here

15:12.978 --> 15:14.045
while I help Roxie get dressed.

15:14.546 --> 15:18.550
( <i>organ playing</i> )

15:18.550 --> 15:20.085
Nice organ.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.254
You're not the first
to say so.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.889
I thought you were
going to officiate.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.790
Aunt Irma questioned
my credentials.

15:25.790 --> 15:28.126
Like the Internet isn't
a good enough place

15:28.126 --> 15:30.028
to be ordained.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.402
Oh, do you think
Sabrina's plan will work?

15:37.402 --> 15:38.436
Absolutely.

15:38.436 --> 15:40.405
Let's run while
I've still got hair.

15:40.405 --> 15:42.073
IRMA:
Friends, witches, trolls

15:42.073 --> 15:44.676
we are gathered here
to witness the joining

15:44.676 --> 15:46.545
of two powerful witch families

15:46.545 --> 15:49.781
which I, in my infinite wisdom,
have brought together.

15:49.781 --> 15:59.124
( <i>"Wedding March" playing</i> )

15:59.124 --> 16:01.026
Interesting choice.

16:01.026 --> 16:04.563
I guess there's no law
that says a father has
to give the bride away.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.097
Unless that is
Roxie's father.

16:06.097 --> 16:09.668
What? I hear she comes
from a very strange family.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.576
You are about to witness

16:17.576 --> 16:20.078
a special kind
of Other Realm wedding.

16:20.078 --> 16:22.480
The young couple asked
to write their own vows.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.115
Oh, how beautiful.

16:24.115 --> 16:26.217
But I vetoed that.

16:26.217 --> 16:28.353
We shall start
with traditional drinking

16:28.353 --> 16:29.688
of the Passion Ambrosia.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.323
Peter, lift
the bride's veil.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.359
Uh, we thought we'd wait
till the end of the ceremony

16:34.359 --> 16:35.627
to do that.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.195
Nonsense. Here, let me help you.

16:37.195 --> 16:38.597
No, that's not necessary.

16:38.597 --> 16:39.798
Silence.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.400
Lift the veil.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.869
Oh, my God,
Sabrina!?

16:44.869 --> 16:45.837
Sabrina?!
Sabrina?!

16:45.837 --> 16:47.539
Well, of course
it's Sabrina.

16:47.539 --> 16:48.907
Whom were
you expecting?

16:48.907 --> 16:50.642
Yes, whom were
you expecting?

16:50.642 --> 16:52.844
All right, Aunt Irma,
marry us already.

16:52.844 --> 16:54.079
What's going on?

16:54.079 --> 16:55.747
Sabrina, I'm not
going to marry you.

16:55.747 --> 16:56.881
I don't love you.

16:56.881 --> 16:57.882
I don't love
you either.

16:57.882 --> 16:58.783
No marriage is
perfect.

16:58.783 --> 17:00.585
Moving along-- I do.

17:00.585 --> 17:02.087
But I love Roxie.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.589
This is Roxie.
She played with rocks.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.857
What?
What?

17:05.857 --> 17:07.759
Look, Peter, if you
love Roxie, you have
to marry me.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.561
Honey, what are
you talking about?

17:09.561 --> 17:10.895
If Peter marries a mortal

17:10.895 --> 17:12.564
Aunt Irma said she'd make
that mortal miserable

17:12.564 --> 17:13.632
for the rest of her life

17:13.632 --> 17:15.066
and Peter would never
see her again.

17:15.066 --> 17:16.368
I can't let that happen
to Roxie

17:16.368 --> 17:17.669
so I'm taking
her place instead.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.471
Sabrina, why didn't
you tell us?

17:19.471 --> 17:21.239
'Cause I knew you'd
try to stop me.

17:21.239 --> 17:23.241
You were willing to sacrifice
your own happiness

17:23.241 --> 17:24.576
to save a friend?

17:24.576 --> 17:26.444
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
There's no other way.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.814
Oh, that is so touching.

17:29.814 --> 17:31.116
Now, where was I?

17:31.116 --> 17:32.517
Dearly beloved...

17:32.517 --> 17:34.319
Aunt Irma, how could
you let Sabrina

17:34.319 --> 17:35.453
go through with this?!

17:35.453 --> 17:37.022
Marry somebody
she doesn't love

17:37.022 --> 17:38.757
and make these two
young people miserable

17:38.757 --> 17:40.191
for the rest
of their lives?

17:40.191 --> 17:41.826
( <i>all groaning</i> )

17:41.826 --> 17:44.529
Silence!

17:44.529 --> 17:46.231
I suppose even though
their misery

17:46.231 --> 17:48.600
could bring me
untold happiness

17:48.600 --> 17:51.569
I must call off this union
of holy matrimony.

17:51.569 --> 17:53.071
( <i>applause</i> )

17:53.071 --> 17:54.305
Whoo-whoo.

17:54.305 --> 17:56.541
And I'm through wasting
my time and energies

17:56.541 --> 17:57.542
being a matchmaker.

17:57.542 --> 17:58.643
Here, here.

17:58.643 --> 17:59.778
Although

17:59.778 --> 18:02.647
if you could get
a little meat on
your bones

18:02.647 --> 18:05.684
I could fix you up with
a really cute cyclops.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.286
Keep an <i>eye</i> out for me.

18:08.286 --> 18:11.022
I know, silence.

18:11.022 --> 18:13.958
You know, I just want
to thank you for what
you did for Roxie.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.460
You are a really
good friend.

18:15.460 --> 18:18.997
Hey, any decent person
would go behind her
best friend's back

18:18.997 --> 18:20.265
and marry her fiancé.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.366
Well, I'm just glad
that

18:21.366 --> 18:22.901
Roxie and I get
to be together again.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.002
Me, too.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.337
You know, I know
it's none of my business

18:26.337 --> 18:30.175
but I would recommend
slowing down a little bit.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.410
Peter, where have you been?

18:32.410 --> 18:34.012
It's a long story.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.280
How could you disappear
for a whole weekend

18:35.280 --> 18:36.214
and not call me?

18:36.214 --> 18:37.549
I had no way
to get in touch with you.

18:37.549 --> 18:38.883
I don't have
your home phone number.

18:38.883 --> 18:40.118
I don't know where you live.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.120
And now that I've had
a weekend to think about it

18:42.120 --> 18:43.955
I realized I don't know
anything about you.

18:43.955 --> 18:45.356
For example,
where'd you grow up?

18:45.356 --> 18:46.324
Uh, you might not want

18:46.324 --> 18:47.692
to hit him with
the tough questions

18:47.692 --> 18:48.727
right out of the gate.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.128
What's so tough
about that?

18:50.128 --> 18:51.262
Are you from
Jersey or
something?

18:51.262 --> 18:53.598
There are going to be
a lot of tough questions along
the way.

18:53.598 --> 18:54.866
What are you
talking about

18:54.866 --> 18:56.935
and how come you're standing
there not saying anything?

18:56.935 --> 18:59.437
Uh,you know what? I think
I'm going to go wash my hair.

18:59.437 --> 19:01.139
Yeah! That's what
I'm going to do.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.440
I'm not saying
anything

19:02.440 --> 19:04.175
because I'm
figuring out
how to answer.

19:04.175 --> 19:06.244
Great, another guy with
communication problems.

19:06.244 --> 19:08.046
No,look-- I
want
to open up.

19:08.046 --> 19:11.850
Maybe if we slow down,
eventually I'll be able to.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.118
Sabrina was right.

19:13.118 --> 19:15.820
I guess we shouldn't have
gotten so serious so fast.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.188
Probably not.

19:17.188 --> 19:19.057
But you know what?
I'm going to put
this in a safe place

19:19.057 --> 19:20.825
and maybe we can just
start all over.

19:20.825 --> 19:21.826
I'd like that.

19:21.826 --> 19:22.827
Hi.

19:22.827 --> 19:24.963
Hi.

19:24.963 --> 19:26.164
I didn't grow up in Jersey.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.632
Well, that's a start.

19:27.632 --> 19:29.134
You free on Friday?

19:29.134 --> 19:31.035
Yeah. Where do you
want to go?

19:31.035 --> 19:32.570
Anywhere but Umberto's.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.206
Um,I didn't pay the
check.

19:35.206 --> 19:36.374
Yeah, you did

19:36.374 --> 19:39.577
and you left a really
nice tip, too.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.585
Okay, I've got my first
recital on Tuesday

19:47.585 --> 19:49.420
and I just want
to run through
my routine

19:49.420 --> 19:51.556
and get your
honest opinion.

19:51.556 --> 20:05.103
( <i>"Dance of the Sugarplum</i>
<i>Fairies" playing</i> )

20:05.103 --> 20:06.838
So what do you think--
honestly?

20:06.838 --> 20:07.906
Honestly?

20:07.906 --> 20:09.808
I think you're a man
of many talents

20:09.808 --> 20:11.509
but dance is not one of them.

20:11.509 --> 20:13.011
I'd like to see you do better.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.612
It's a lot harder
than it looks.

20:14.612 --> 20:16.514
Well, I'll try.

20:16.514 --> 20:32.397
( <i>music resumes</i> )

20:32.397 --> 20:35.600
Whew! You're right,
it's not as easy
as it looks.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.135
I'm hanging up my tights.

20:37.135 --> 20:38.903
Actually, Roxie's tights.
