WEBVTT

00:18.435 --> 00:19.728
Your share.

00:22.773 --> 00:26.026
And a passport. And I paid for it meself.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.029
Only seemed fair.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.369
Looks like they put you through it.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.625
I knew something they wanted to know,

00:43.252 --> 00:44.294
didn't I, Charlie?

00:44.378 --> 00:45.754
Fucking hell, Dale.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.465
You want me to say thank you?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.260
Then fuck yes. Thank you.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.848
You wanna hit me?
Go on. Punch me in the kisser.

00:57.683 --> 00:58.851
I fucked myself.

01:02.229 --> 01:06.733
But now, if I'm free,
then I'm free to go where I wanted

01:07.776 --> 01:10.404
before I was stupid enough
to mess around with you.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.207
A fucking Kiwi?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.543
It was the best I could do
on short notice.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.503
Okay.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.880
Know where you're gonna go?

01:29.965 --> 01:30.966
Yeah.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.512
Gonna go find yourself, Dale?

01:36.471 --> 01:40.100
No. I'm gonna lose myself.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.747
Oi.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.417
You. You need hospital?

02:05.501 --> 02:08.211
No. No hospital.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.051
I'm fine.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.275
This is the most capable night manager

02:30.359 --> 02:33.445
in this, the best, cheapest hotel
in all of Colaba.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.697
Yaar, Prabhu,
do you realize what time it is?

02:36.406 --> 02:39.284
I don't want any more fucking goras
this late.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.119
But they're very tired

02:41.203 --> 02:43.288
and would appreciate
being checked into the room.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.915
Take them, please.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.627
-I'll do it because it's you.
-Then do it.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.089
-Okay. Fill it in.
-Thank you very much.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.883
This man says he is a hotel guest?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.093
Who?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.887
This man says he is a hotel guest.
Is this true?

02:58.971 --> 03:00.764
Yes, he is a guest.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.932
What is his name?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.600
-Just a second. It's in the register.
-Let me see.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.228
-I'll show you, sir.
-Give it to me.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.773
Show me his C-Form.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.025
C-Form, it would be over here.

03:18.407 --> 03:21.076
The bastard has been fighting
and does not want the hospital.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.079
-Oh, yeah?
-Come on. Why does it take so long?

03:25.789 --> 03:28.166
What happened?
This pandu is a full motherfucker.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.128
If you don't bribe him,
he'll take you to jail. What happened?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.296
I got mugged.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.049
They took everything,
even my fucking boots.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.384
Everything?

03:37.467 --> 03:38.969
I just need to lie down.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.722
Show me his room. Now.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.809
-Lin. No passport, no money…
-What are you doing?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.228
…is very, very big problem in Bombay.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.272
We have to go now. Lin, let's go.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.233
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.403
This is the room.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.189
Okay.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.359
Yes, sir.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.374
Okay. Here is water.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.398
Now I see why you're carrying
this impressive medicine box.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.528
You should also be carrying
more than one pair of shoes, na?

05:33.625 --> 05:34.877
Best medicine.

05:48.307 --> 05:51.894
Tomorrow, first thing,
I will take you New Zealand consulate.

05:51.977 --> 05:55.063
They will give you new passport, money.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.732
I can't go to the authorities.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.403
It's not an option for me.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.033
Okay.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.494
Please. Come. Eat, na.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.496
You are my guest,

06:11.580 --> 06:15.876
and Lakshmi, my neighbor, she is making…

06:17.669 --> 06:18.962
first-class roti.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.632
Thank you.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.021
Good, huh?

06:36.104 --> 06:39.024
Wow. It is very spicy.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.908
Dhanayavaad, for everything.

06:52.788 --> 06:56.124
I don't know about you,
but I need a drink.

06:59.545 --> 07:00.546
What is that?

07:00.629 --> 07:03.924
It's been three weeks. I still don't know
which waggle means what.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.218
Okay.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.556
Right now it is meaning, "Certainly,
by all means, I'll drink with you."

07:10.639 --> 07:14.351
But it can also mean "no." Or "hello."

07:15.143 --> 07:17.271
Or, "I understand."

07:17.855 --> 07:23.986
Or even, "I am a man of peace,
so please do not be hurting me."

07:24.069 --> 07:26.321
And you could learn this, huh?

07:26.405 --> 07:29.199
Then this won't happen,
this won't happen, that won't happen.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.159
After you.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.760
Oi, take it easy.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.724
So good.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.434
Very, very smooth, yaar.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.103
Okay.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.399
Hey, man.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.820
Keep it.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.911
Is there a problem?

08:15.162 --> 08:16.663
No. Just…

08:17.831 --> 08:20.667
If I was knowing this was my whiskey
and not yours,

08:20.751 --> 08:25.964
I would not have been so generous
with myself in drinking it, na.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.675
Really?

08:37.183 --> 08:40.645
What are you doing? Wh-- Hey!

08:44.775 --> 08:46.193
Are you crazy?

08:49.321 --> 08:51.740
This shirt was cleaned today only, yaar.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.081
Take it.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.667
It's for you.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.838
Really?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.684
Dale!

10:50.776 --> 10:52.361
You fucking dog.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.990
Back to where you belong.

11:01.578 --> 11:05.415
Someone once told me that
a dream is where a wish and fear meet.

11:06.959 --> 11:11.129
When the wish and the fear are the same,
we call the dream a nightmare.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.774
You sure it was Rujul?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.694
Fat and shiny, a lot of gold.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.822
Stubby fingers, little mushroom cock.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.659
And I heard his name,

11:42.035 --> 11:43.579
when Walid was cheering him on.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.919
And you're sure Rujul promised Walid
the Sagar Wada slum land?

11:53.589 --> 11:54.631
Yeah.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.760
We were their entertainment,
a way for them to seal their deal.

12:07.436 --> 12:11.440
The other girl, Sunny, understood it all,

12:11.523 --> 12:13.567
who they were, what they were doing.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.362
Rujul and Walid didn't give a shit
if we heard.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.661
Then Sunny disappeared,
and Zhou wouldn't let me leave.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.124
Had to bribe that maid to come tell you.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.420
She's dead, isn't she? Sunny.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.717
I'd be the same if I didn't know you.

13:37.818 --> 13:41.113
They all stared at me with such intensity,
that I thought they must hate me.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.575
Now I know
they were simply staring at my fear.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.370
It's what people know about themselves
that makes them afraid.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.170
Excuse me. Where's the toilet?

14:07.347 --> 14:10.100
How much shouting and yelling
you were doing last night?

14:10.184 --> 14:13.562
Bad dreams, na?
That is why I let you sleep this morning.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.772
Great.
Listen, I really need to go to the--

14:15.856 --> 14:17.733
Hey! Lin, this is Lakshmi.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.651
She made the roti
we were eating last night.

14:19.735 --> 14:23.363
Hi. Hey. Thank you. Was delicious.

14:29.745 --> 14:30.996
Where are we?

14:31.079 --> 14:33.457
This is the Sagar Wada jhopadpatti.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.833
My home.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.169
We are the not-people,

14:37.252 --> 14:42.257
and these hutments are the not-houses
where we are not living.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.807
Whose are they?

14:54.311 --> 14:56.021
Her husband. He's gone.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.775
I can't take her dead husband's shoes.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.736
Not dead, Linbaba.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.447
Gone to Dubai only, for the work there.

15:10.244 --> 15:11.828
Thank you. Thank you.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.793
-I really do need to shit.
-Let us go.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.754
Hurry.

15:24.758 --> 15:25.843
It's good?

15:45.237 --> 15:46.363
You mind?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.865
If you think it helps.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.450
Can't make it worse.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.578
You said you want to quit.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.334
You know what'll happen
if you tell Khaderbhai about Rujul, right?

16:02.462 --> 16:03.463
I'm out now.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.592
We could stay quiet.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.678
If Rujul's betraying us, then
I've worked the last year for nothing.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.430
You would've let me rot in the Palace

16:11.513 --> 16:13.765
if I hadn't known something
that threatened your precious land deal.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.935
You used me.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.897
How are you any different
than Maurizio and Modena?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.732
Or maybe you're the one doing the using.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.818
You don't give a shit about Rujul.

16:24.902 --> 16:27.112
The drugs, me, those guys,

16:27.196 --> 16:30.991
just a way to pass the buck and take
no responsibility for yourself whatsoever.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.546
How are you doing, Arun? Johnny?

16:44.630 --> 16:45.714
Prabhu.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.011
-I'll help them.
-You won't. I'll go.

16:52.429 --> 16:53.680
Go clean the table.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.808
Do you want something?

16:56.892 --> 16:59.228
Chai and roti for us both, please.

16:59.311 --> 17:00.604
How you going?

17:01.688 --> 17:02.814
Come. Sit.

17:04.775 --> 17:10.071
Sit, na. Nandita is making
world best chai in all Bombay. Trust me.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.156
Okay.

17:13.534 --> 17:16.369
Arre, thank you, Kaaki. Thank you.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.454
Thank you.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.669
Who's the gora?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.257
-He is my new business partner.
-Business partner?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.385
We are going to be working together
in the tourist business.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.472
Parvati?

17:35.556 --> 17:36.723
I'm coming!

17:37.432 --> 17:40.477
-What did you say to her?
-That you are my good friend.

17:41.770 --> 17:45.357
That is Parvati,
and I am determined to marry her, Linbaba.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.234
That's your girlfriend?

17:47.317 --> 17:49.069
I did not say she was my girlfriend.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.780
This is the first time
we've ever spoken words to each other.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.825
You've never spoken to her before?

17:55.659 --> 17:56.994
It is a momentous day.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.997
Well, glad I could be here to see it.

18:01.164 --> 18:04.626
Listen, mate.
I need to figure out my situation.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.046
You can't go to your authorities.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.382
-Shut the fuck--
-But you are needing money, yes?

18:10.465 --> 18:13.427
I have been thinking to help you
get it very fast.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.680
What about the train tickets?
To your village.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.974
You still have them, right?
Can we sell them?

18:19.641 --> 18:23.604
Very difficult to sell tickets for a train
that has already left the station. No.

18:23.687 --> 18:28.525
I think it is best idea
to become business partners.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.360
To be Bombay guides together.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.738
-I'm not staying, Prabhu.
-Just think, Linbaba.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.823
-So much money will be coming.
-I just need to get to Karla.

18:34.907 --> 18:38.076
-Listen to me, please. We could both be--
-I can't, Prabhu.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.171
Hey. Hey.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.176
Thank you for last night. All right?

18:54.259 --> 18:56.637
You were a lifesaver. You really were.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.555
But I'm not staying here and hustling,
all right?

18:58.639 --> 19:01.016
It's just not gonna happen. All right?

19:04.228 --> 19:06.522
All right.
I'll be back for my stuff later.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.080
Karla, it's Lin.

19:23.622 --> 19:26.416
Karla, you there? I need to talk to you.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.216
-What happened?
-Madame Zhou figured it out.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.510
They almost killed me.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.181
They took my money,
my passport, everything.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.853
-I warned you it was dangerous.
-You did, yeah. Now I'm fucked.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.312
Then go to your embassy.

19:49.606 --> 19:50.649
I can't.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.026
How is that my problem?

19:55.445 --> 19:56.572
Seriously?

19:57.573 --> 19:59.825
Karla, I don't understand
why you're being like this.

19:59.908 --> 20:00.909
I'm asking for help.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.247
Karla, you need to fucking help me.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.332
I don't need to do anything.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.710
I have somewhere to be.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.716
Is she for real?

20:17.926 --> 20:19.595
You look like a man who needs a drink.

20:23.974 --> 20:26.143
I know you didn't give me
all the dope last night.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.616
Now it's up to me, not her.

20:47.581 --> 20:49.583
Karla can spot them a mile away.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.877
Who?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.212
People she can use.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.215
She didn't force me to do anything.

20:56.298 --> 20:59.551
Didn't need to. It's her gift.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.722
What's so special about Karla anyway?

21:05.224 --> 21:07.351
I'm as beautiful as she is, aren't I?

21:09.520 --> 21:11.480
I feel even better than I look.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.731
Don't.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.860
Lisa, you don't have to do that.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.321
Maybe I wanna feel good.

21:21.073 --> 21:24.076
Don't you? We can feel good together.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.370
Lisa.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.374
You're shit-faced.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.384
Why do men like bitches?

21:41.093 --> 21:42.135
It's true.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.849
They fall over women
who treat them like shit.

21:46.932 --> 21:48.267
Can't get enough of it.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.398
This fucking sucks.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.235
You never tried to quit before?

22:02.447 --> 22:03.699
I like being high.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.995
I like there being some distance.

22:10.289 --> 22:11.874
I'm not good with life stuff.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.251
Never have been.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.047
Maybe Karla left that
'cause she knew you'd find it.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.593
Fuck, you're right.

22:23.969 --> 22:27.222
I take this, she can throw me out.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.311
You're not as dumb as you look, Lin.

22:35.772 --> 22:36.982
I'm gonna puke.

22:47.326 --> 22:49.912
How long is it this bad?

22:49.995 --> 22:51.413
Few days.

22:52.456 --> 22:53.916
And then it gets better?

22:54.791 --> 22:56.126
It does.

23:09.306 --> 23:10.599
You don't miss it?

23:12.809 --> 23:14.228
Every day.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.136
Khaderbhai.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.390
Salaam alaikum.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.933
Alaikumu assalam.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.355
It's good to see you. Please.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.439
Thank you.

24:02.985 --> 24:06.154
Is everything all right?
You said it was urgent.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.950
I went to the Palace last night.

24:10.659 --> 24:14.705
Your hate for Zhou is a wound that will
never heal if you keep picking at it.

24:14.788 --> 24:17.165
Zhou was holding my friend Lisa prisoner.

24:17.249 --> 24:18.584
Because of what Lisa knew.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.337
We're being betrayed.

24:27.885 --> 24:31.638
Our business together has been
the usual Bombay dhanda.

24:31.722 --> 24:34.725
Bribes and understandings,
what everyone expects.

24:36.101 --> 24:39.271
But I have other business. You know this.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.233
Out of respect and affection for you,

24:43.317 --> 24:47.029
I've never asked you to cross the line
between my two worlds, Karla.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.867
-Are you certain?
-I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

24:51.950 --> 24:55.454
I mean, you must be certain
that you are ready

24:55.537 --> 24:58.957
for what telling me
about this betrayal means.

25:00.959 --> 25:04.254
If I don't tell you what I know,
then you'll suffer.

25:05.339 --> 25:06.965
Instead, you would suffer for me.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.551
You've done so much for me.

25:09.635 --> 25:11.094
There is no debt between us.

25:11.178 --> 25:15.891
Love has no accounting or ledger
or quid pro quo.

25:17.267 --> 25:21.438
We invest it because our heart insists
without any demand of return.

25:22.147 --> 25:28.362
And this is the lesson, above all others,
you still need to learn, Karla.

25:33.951 --> 25:38.413
Rujul Aadekar has been meeting
with Walid Shah.

25:40.249 --> 25:43.877
He will accept Walid's bid for Sagar Wada,
not ours.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.470
You better not be wrong about this.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.833
Thank you.

26:26.461 --> 26:28.255
I don't know why people can't be nicer.

26:30.549 --> 26:31.633
Was it a girl?

26:32.885 --> 26:34.928
Turned you on to heroin the first time?

26:36.221 --> 26:37.514
Who was she?

26:38.807 --> 26:40.392
It doesn't matter.

26:41.435 --> 26:43.854
It's always love
that sends us down the rabbit hole.

26:53.906 --> 26:54.990
Are you scared?

26:56.200 --> 26:57.451
Trust you.

27:04.124 --> 27:07.878
Once we have the money to go to India,
we can do this every day.

27:14.635 --> 27:17.304
We're gonna have
such an amazing time, baby.

27:30.526 --> 27:33.654
Do me a favor? Get rid of that shit.

27:34.613 --> 27:35.614
Sure.

27:40.369 --> 27:41.537
Lisa. Hey.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.665
Who's Rujul Aadekar?

27:46.792 --> 27:48.210
Forget you ever heard that.

27:48.293 --> 27:49.503
Tell me.

27:49.586 --> 27:51.296
No. Leave that alone.

27:53.507 --> 27:56.218
You're helping me. I'm helping you.

28:07.980 --> 28:12.150
The Palace is allowed to exist
because it has never taken sides.

28:12.234 --> 28:15.863
Zhou will be reminded of the grace
under which she operates.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.993
Tell me about this man who helped you.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.204
His name is Lin Ford.

28:24.788 --> 28:27.875
I knew he was about to leave town,
so I used him to get Lisa out.

28:27.958 --> 28:30.836
You must have trusted him.
That is no small thing for you.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.672
I was in a hurry. He fit the bill.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.886
Does he know about Rujul?

28:38.969 --> 28:41.930
He heard the name. Nothing more.

28:42.014 --> 28:43.682
Has no idea what any of it means.

28:43.765 --> 28:47.060
But a smart and resourceful man
might decide to ask.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.985
Okay, okay. I'll see you soon.
Thank you, thank you.

28:55.068 --> 28:57.321
Pleasure. Pleasure.
And we do it like this, yeah?

28:57.404 --> 28:58.405
Hey.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.909
What happened to your face?

29:01.992 --> 29:03.285
I got mugged.

29:04.453 --> 29:05.787
-Wow.
-I need new papers.

29:07.331 --> 29:09.082
Why are you asking me?

29:09.166 --> 29:11.543
'Cause you are the biggest crook I know
in Bombay.

29:11.627 --> 29:13.462
-No offense.
-None taken.

29:14.046 --> 29:16.507
And I can assume,
for reasons I need not know,

29:16.590 --> 29:18.383
that your consulate is not an option?

29:19.927 --> 29:21.762
Bien sûr. Or you wouldn't need a crook.

29:21.845 --> 29:25.015
I need to buy a passport.
You said you know the guy.

29:25.098 --> 29:27.976
Abdel Khader Khan controls
the book business in Bombay.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.937
Well, can you set me up with him?

29:30.604 --> 29:33.774
If they sold my passport to him,
maybe he'd sell it back to me.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.820
Have you read The Godfather, Lin?

29:39.863 --> 29:40.864
I've seen the film.

29:41.532 --> 29:42.950
That is Khader Khan.

29:43.033 --> 29:45.452
This is not a man
with whom you just get set up.

29:45.536 --> 29:47.538
What would you offer him?
You said you have no money.

29:47.621 --> 29:51.166
A good passport, one worth having,
will cost a thousand dollars.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.001
A thousand dollars.

29:53.544 --> 29:56.129
Come on. There must be something I can do.

29:56.213 --> 29:57.881
No one knows this place like you do.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.968
I thought we were friends.

30:01.051 --> 30:05.472
I do not have friends.
Times like this are exactly why.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.684
Well, I gotta do something.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.854
You know,
I slept in a fucking slum last night.

30:11.937 --> 30:13.856
As did half of Bombay.

30:18.318 --> 30:23.448
Do you know a guy called Rujul Aadekar?
Or Ah-dee-kuhr.

30:23.532 --> 30:25.158
Yeah, he's a local politician.

30:25.242 --> 30:28.662
Well, he's involved with some shady shit
at the Palace, Madame Zhou's place--

30:28.745 --> 30:29.746
Just-- Keep your--

30:29.830 --> 30:32.082
Maybe that information
would be worth something to someone.

30:32.165 --> 30:36.211
-Could you just ask around?
-Keep your voice down.

30:36.295 --> 30:38.463
Fuck that. I want my freedom back, Didier.

30:38.547 --> 30:41.675
-I don't care if I screw over Zhou, Karla…
-Will you calm down?

30:41.758 --> 30:44.094
…the Godfather, Rujul,
whoever the fuck, until I get it. Whatev--

30:44.178 --> 30:45.762
-Fuck.
-Gentlemen.

30:47.514 --> 30:50.851
Dirty Harry, Lin. I've seen it now on VCR.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.938
It's not a Western,
but very good all the same.

30:55.022 --> 30:58.317
"Did I fire six shots, or only five?"

30:59.860 --> 31:02.487
-It's very cool.
-Bonne chance, Lin. Okay?

31:02.571 --> 31:04.072
Wish you good luck.

31:08.243 --> 31:10.871
For a Few Dollars More
is my favorite, yaar.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.706
And then maybe Josey Wales.

31:12.789 --> 31:15.584
Actually, no, the whole Dollars trilogy
would be my one-two-three.

31:15.667 --> 31:19.713
And then maybe Josey Wales is my fourth,
because-- just the way he puts it all--

31:24.468 --> 31:26.011
You and me need to have a word.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.807
This guy is crazy. Look at him.

31:30.891 --> 31:32.309
Let me get rid of him. Apologies.

31:32.392 --> 31:34.186
I'm going nowhere, mate.

31:34.686 --> 31:36.438
I just got the shit kicked out of me.

31:36.522 --> 31:39.066
After I went and helped Karla
get Lisa out of the Palace.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.860
What? What happened to Lisa?

31:42.402 --> 31:43.654
Oh, you didn't know?

31:44.154 --> 31:46.532
Zhou was holding her prisoner.
She's a fucking mess.

31:48.367 --> 31:50.577
Sorry. You need to leave.

31:50.661 --> 31:51.662
Thank you.

31:51.745 --> 31:53.413
No, no, no, no.

31:53.497 --> 31:55.415
Where are you going?
It's a joke. Where are you going?

32:00.254 --> 32:04.466
You know, I think you should
stop interfering with my business.

32:05.175 --> 32:07.344
Lin, is Lisa all right? Where is she now?

32:07.427 --> 32:09.221
What, you think I'd tell you arseholes?

32:10.806 --> 32:14.351
Zhou's people took my money
and my passport.

32:15.435 --> 32:18.647
-The way I see it, all of that is on you.
-Hey, hey, hey.

32:19.815 --> 32:21.650
If you went to play hero
for a junkie whore,

32:21.733 --> 32:23.026
that is Lisa's problem.

32:24.194 --> 32:27.948
And if you did it to please Karla…
That is her problem.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.993
But you and I, we have no relationship.

32:31.660 --> 32:32.744
I owe you nothing.

32:33.495 --> 32:35.330
I think you're wrong about that.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.918
-Don't fucking walk away from me.
-Arre, chaps.

32:40.002 --> 32:42.671
-It's okay. No, it's okay.
-This is not the place. Please, sit down.

32:42.754 --> 32:43.755
Both of you, sit.

32:43.839 --> 32:45.215
-After you.
-Have a seat.

32:49.595 --> 32:53.724
Who the fuck do you think you are?

32:54.766 --> 32:56.810
You turn up here, you think you matter?

32:59.813 --> 33:02.816
You know, only a fool plays a game
without knowing the rules first,

33:04.151 --> 33:05.777
or the other players.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.406
Let's go, Modena.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.829
I wanted to smash
his pretty smiling face in.

33:16.455 --> 33:20.042
Because I knew I could
and because it would feel great.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.085
But mainly 'cause I knew he was right.

33:35.807 --> 33:36.808
Prabhu.

33:40.187 --> 33:43.315
Look, after this morning, I wouldn't
blame you if you tell me to piss off,

33:44.233 --> 33:46.610
but I need to make a phone call,
and I've got no money.

33:50.697 --> 33:51.698
Yeah?

33:52.533 --> 33:53.700
All right. Thank you.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.590
Can I make an international call?

34:08.674 --> 34:09.675
Of course, Linbaba.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.844
For three rupees you can call
anywhere in the world.

34:11.927 --> 34:15.597
But one thing. I thought you had
no one to be calling for help.

34:15.681 --> 34:17.139
There's one person who owes me.

34:17.766 --> 34:18.851
ISD.

34:21.687 --> 34:23.146
-Thank you.
-Dial.

34:36.201 --> 34:37.536
It's okay?

34:42.958 --> 34:45.878
-Yeah?
-Hey. It's me.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.132
Charlie, you there? It's Dale.

34:52.134 --> 34:55.679
You shouldn't be calling me.
There's no contact, we said.

34:56.889 --> 34:58.515
I know. I know, mate.

34:58.599 --> 35:01.643
Look, I need you to send me
some money to Bombay.

35:02.311 --> 35:04.813
Dale, you got what you were owed.

35:04.897 --> 35:07.649
You can't just call and expect
to keep sucking on the tit, mate.

35:09.860 --> 35:11.778
I'm in serious trouble, Charlie.

35:11.862 --> 35:13.780
Well, it's a bit of a habit with you, eh?

35:13.864 --> 35:15.741
Always got your dick in a vice.

35:16.575 --> 35:18.368
This one's nothing to do with me.

35:18.452 --> 35:21.872
Yes, it is, because my whole life
is fucked because of you.

35:24.708 --> 35:27.002
Come on, Charlie.
Just help me out, please.

35:28.128 --> 35:30.672
-You owe me.
-Not anymore, I don't.

35:30.756 --> 35:32.799
Yes, you do. You fucking owe me.

35:33.759 --> 35:36.803
You'd be rotting in a fucking prison cell
if it wasn't for me.

35:39.348 --> 35:40.432
Charlie.

35:44.561 --> 35:46.021
Fuck!

35:48.315 --> 35:49.358
Lin.

35:59.409 --> 36:00.410
Lin!

36:03.413 --> 36:04.540
Lin!

36:11.588 --> 36:13.799
-Lin, wait!
-What? What? Why?

36:14.675 --> 36:16.051
Why you trying to help me?

36:16.718 --> 36:18.887
I barely know you.
You know nothing about me.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.390
Because you're my mate.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.267
Yeah, mates. Mates.

36:23.350 --> 36:25.435
Mates just fuck you over. Trust me.

36:28.355 --> 36:30.023
-Lin.
-What?

36:30.107 --> 36:32.943
Listen. Here, we have nothing.

36:34.611 --> 36:38.407
This place is not working
without everyone helping each other.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.743
Like I want to help you, Lin.

36:51.587 --> 36:52.671
Okay?

37:04.099 --> 37:06.310
I've been a total prick to you all day.

37:06.393 --> 37:07.978
Yes.

37:08.061 --> 37:11.690
I can tell you're having
a not-so-good time.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.569
Also not fully understanding
your situation.

37:15.652 --> 37:18.739
But now, I think you are understanding.

37:18.822 --> 37:20.824
-What? That I'm totally fucked?
-Yes.

37:22.409 --> 37:25.162
And so now you're understanding
we can start getting you…

37:26.538 --> 37:27.664
"unfuck."

37:27.748 --> 37:29.458
-"Unfucked."
-Yes, "unfuck."

37:30.375 --> 37:32.544
With us both working together,

37:33.795 --> 37:37.382
we will make good money fatafat, Linbaba.

37:44.223 --> 37:48.060
All right.
Then I guess we better get started.

37:48.977 --> 37:52.231
Chalo. Chalo, boss.

37:52.314 --> 37:55.484
What kind of man is this Lin,
do you think?

37:55.567 --> 37:58.820
I don't know. But Karla asked him for help
and he gave it.

37:59.446 --> 38:01.156
I got a call from Reynaldo's.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.033
He was there, making a scene.

38:03.909 --> 38:07.746
He knows more than he should
and talks more than I like.

38:14.962 --> 38:16.380
Assalamu alaikum.

38:16.463 --> 38:20.384
Alaikumu assalam.
Thank you for coming, Minister.

38:20.467 --> 38:22.302
Of course. You call, I come.

38:24.847 --> 38:27.391
You have been doing your homework, I see.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.518
Knowledge is power, Rujul.

38:30.102 --> 38:34.064
Only if you combine
with money and influence.

38:34.147 --> 38:36.400
Or, in my case,
a very fine government position.

38:38.193 --> 38:41.905
These people in Sagar Wada all know
they are fucked.

38:42.656 --> 38:45.492
But, there's no power in that for them.

38:45.576 --> 38:48.662
When was the last time you went
to one of the jhopadpattis?

38:48.745 --> 38:50.581
To see the people there.

38:50.664 --> 38:54.918
When I first came to Bombay,
I spent time in one of them.

38:55.002 --> 38:56.670
It's long gone now,

38:56.753 --> 39:01.675
but what I saw then, and still see now,
is they do not believe themselves fucked.

39:02.342 --> 39:06.096
They do not have the brains
nor the education to foster ambition.

39:06.889 --> 39:10.392
-Ambitious men are never content.
-Men like us?

39:10.475 --> 39:13.353
Yes, my friend. Men like us.

39:14.730 --> 39:16.315
You're not in the slum any longer.

39:16.398 --> 39:19.401
No, but I never forgot
the lessons I learned there.

39:20.194 --> 39:22.863
Loyalty is everything.

39:24.489 --> 39:28.076
I wonder what Walid learned
at Zhou's palace.

39:29.411 --> 39:33.207
I know you plan to betray me

39:34.291 --> 39:37.169
and sell Sagar Wada to Walid Shah.

39:38.587 --> 39:40.339
Have I wronged you in any way?

39:41.715 --> 39:42.716
Khaderbhai--

39:42.799 --> 39:45.177
I financed your entire political career.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.471
We have been friends.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.389
So tell me…

39:51.683 --> 39:53.101
how have I wronged you?

40:00.651 --> 40:02.277
You have fallen behind.

40:04.238 --> 40:09.409
Your insistence in staying
out of the brown sugar and sex trade

40:09.993 --> 40:13.121
means you cannot compete
with Walid's price for Sagar Wada.

40:15.249 --> 40:17.459
So, I did not wrong you?

40:18.544 --> 40:21.046
I am supposed to make less money

40:21.129 --> 40:23.841
because of your absurd code of morality?

40:24.466 --> 40:27.719
Well, you could have come to me.
I would've listened.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.348
And done nothing.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.935
You have become weak, Khader.

41:00.127 --> 41:01.211
Lisa.

41:04.006 --> 41:05.132
Lisa, it's Sebastian.

41:13.390 --> 41:14.933
What are you doing here?

41:15.017 --> 41:19.271
I-- I wanted to see if you're okay,
if you needed something.

41:19.354 --> 41:20.814
How did you know I was here?

41:21.565 --> 41:24.818
Lin. He came after Maurizio at Reynaldo's.

41:24.902 --> 41:26.820
He's dangerous, that one, I think.

41:26.904 --> 41:28.322
Lin's the one who got me out.

41:29.489 --> 41:31.992
Guy barely knows my name,
and he risked his life for me.

41:42.294 --> 41:44.129
Does Maurizio know you're here?

41:45.255 --> 41:46.798
-No.
-Did he send you?

41:46.882 --> 41:47.883
No. Li--

41:49.635 --> 41:54.348
Lisa, I shouldn't have let Maurizio
make you go to such a place.

41:54.431 --> 41:57.476
I should've told him. I'm sorry, Lisa.

41:59.228 --> 42:00.979
I can see how you look at me now.

42:01.063 --> 42:02.231
And I deserve it.

42:03.273 --> 42:04.983
It's not your fault you're weak.

42:13.534 --> 42:16.411
I… love you.

42:17.579 --> 42:21.041
Yeah. But you can't look after me.

42:24.086 --> 42:25.087
I…

42:27.214 --> 42:28.632
I thought you might need some.

42:30.384 --> 42:31.552
Did you?

42:32.719 --> 42:35.764
Or did Maurizio tell you to shoot me up
so I fall right back into line?

42:35.848 --> 42:38.308
No. Lisa, Maurizio doesn't know
I'm here, I promise. I…

42:39.226 --> 42:41.854
I just want you to be happy. That's all.

42:42.604 --> 42:44.982
Him and me?
You're gonna have to choose, Modena.

42:45.065 --> 42:48.110
You. You, Lisa.
I'd always choose you. Always.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.698
Do you want this? I-- I can…

42:52.781 --> 42:54.741
No. I wanna quit.

42:55.534 --> 42:58.161
You say you love me,
then help me with that.

42:59.204 --> 43:01.498
Lisa. Just tell me how.

43:18.682 --> 43:20.559
This is Prabhu.

43:20.642 --> 43:22.269
From personal experience, I can tell you,

43:22.352 --> 43:24.646
anything you want,
he can get you at the best prices.

43:24.730 --> 43:28.609
This is Dieter, Sarah, and Francois.
Right?

43:28.692 --> 43:31.486
-Yeah.
-Keen to buy some top-quality charas.

43:32.321 --> 43:33.572
Very pleased to meet you.

43:34.156 --> 43:36.575
-How much charas you are wanting?
-We want a pound.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.621
This is a lot of smoking.

43:41.496 --> 43:42.581
Can you do it?

43:43.290 --> 43:45.459
Arre, of course, this is no problem.

43:45.542 --> 43:47.711
You can go drink your beers,
enjoy the good music.

43:47.794 --> 43:49.505
-I'll bring it, okay?
-Sounds good.

43:49.588 --> 43:51.840
-All right. I'll be in in a minute.
-Thank you.

43:52.758 --> 43:55.260
I told you, Linbaba. Good business.

43:55.344 --> 43:56.637
Big money for this.

44:01.517 --> 44:02.518
Wait.

44:04.937 --> 44:07.814
What? You wanna see the sights?
Buy some charas?

44:09.525 --> 44:11.985
There's a thousand dollars in here
for your trouble,

44:12.653 --> 44:14.780
and a name and an address in Ahmedabad.

44:15.822 --> 44:16.990
They'll be expecting you.

44:17.074 --> 44:19.117
They'll make you a new passport
at my expense.

44:19.868 --> 44:21.328
That's what you need, isn't it?

44:22.287 --> 44:23.956
What changed since this morning?

44:27.668 --> 44:30.003
You really need me to keep quiet, eh?

44:30.879 --> 44:34.216
Whatever you're looking for, Lin,
it's not here. Not anymore.

44:35.050 --> 44:36.510
I thought maybe you were it.

44:38.345 --> 44:39.888
Now you know different.

45:06.957 --> 45:08.458
Your half of charas deal.

45:08.542 --> 45:11.545
No, you keep it. I got what I need.

45:14.131 --> 45:16.258
Look, I understand
if you think I'm a prick,

45:16.341 --> 45:20.095
but I would like a proper goodbye.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.322
I will not be seeing you again, na?

45:39.615 --> 45:40.616
No.

45:45.078 --> 45:46.997
You have a good heart, Linbaba.

46:53.438 --> 46:55.649
-Did you tell Khader?
-Yes.

46:57.609 --> 46:59.236
Then we just got a man killed.

47:00.779 --> 47:01.989
It doesn't bother you?

47:02.823 --> 47:04.116
I made my choice.

47:06.326 --> 47:08.120
I found the heroin you left behind.

47:09.663 --> 47:11.456
You wanted to see what choice I'd make?

47:12.374 --> 47:13.667
And?

47:13.750 --> 47:15.002
Lin talked me out of it.

47:15.836 --> 47:17.087
I made him throw it away.

47:19.506 --> 47:20.632
I wanna change.

47:24.428 --> 47:26.138
He could've been good for you.

47:29.933 --> 47:32.227
I gave him a way out of Bombay tonight.

47:33.645 --> 47:35.397
It's the best thing I could give him.

47:35.480 --> 47:37.191
Take a life, save a life?

47:38.734 --> 47:40.027
Does that make it all okay?

47:56.793 --> 47:59.296
We danced together all the time, once.
Do you remember?

48:00.214 --> 48:01.340
I remember.

48:06.553 --> 48:07.804
I was in love with you.

48:10.307 --> 48:12.392
Wanted to be everything you seemed to be.

48:14.186 --> 48:15.437
But, then, you know that.

48:31.578 --> 48:32.746
Fuck me.

48:34.164 --> 48:35.874
I'm leaving. All right?

48:35.958 --> 48:39.419
You tell that mad cow Zhou I'm on my way.

48:39.503 --> 48:42.089
I'm leaving Bombay.
There's no need for any of this.

48:42.756 --> 48:44.007
Fuck you!

48:50.389 --> 48:51.431
Fuck.

50:08.133 --> 50:10.260
I was trying to learn my lesson for once.

50:10.761 --> 50:13.931
Be smart and do what I needed to survive.

50:14.556 --> 50:15.766
To be free.
