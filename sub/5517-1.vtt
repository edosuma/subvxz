00:08.400 --> 00:12.358
--An unprecedented meteor shower
falling off the coast of Tokyo.

00:12.560 --> 00:16.320
The entire city is mesmerised
by this incredible sight.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.678
Two hours after the first contact...

00:18.839 --> 00:21.759
...an unidentified enemy
has reached our coastlines...

00:21.960 --> 00:24.959
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

00:28.279 --> 00:31.519
Right now, one thing is clear:
The world is at war.

00:45.799 --> 00:47.678
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time...

00:47.878 --> 00:50.477
...12 different locations
across the globe were breached...

00:50.637 --> 00:53.997
...in a coordinated attack
by an unknown enemy.

00:54.757 --> 00:57.677
All breaches were
along the coastline...

00:57.878 --> 01:00.277
...in what is a campaign
of rapid dominance.

01:00.478 --> 01:03.078
This is a textbook military invasion.

01:03.599 --> 01:05.996
There are massive casualties
in New York.

01:06.317 --> 01:09.276
Defensive lines
are being set up in Boston.

01:09.477 --> 01:12.996
And at 13:15 Zulu time,
we lost communications...

01:13.197 --> 01:15.356
...with San Francisco and San Diego.

01:15.557 --> 01:16.715
Their status is unknown.

01:18.277 --> 01:22.795
What we know is that we are the last
offensive force on the West Coast.

01:23.477 --> 01:25.795
We cannot lose Los Angeles.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.075
We have five birds down
two klicks west of CP Victory.

01:33.836 --> 01:36.434
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten
your asses, we're going down!

01:36.635 --> 01:38.234
Command and control is down.

01:38.395 --> 01:40.593
Civilians in need of support
two klicks northeast.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.033
Cables inbound.
Engage your sectors of fire, over.

01:43.515 --> 01:46.115
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

02:14.794 --> 02:17.872
Good morning. 94.5 with the Surfrider
Foundation Morning Surf Report.

02:19.633 --> 02:22.073
Surfers, hard northeast conditions
blowing out there...

02:22.273 --> 02:26.592
...the ocean slopping and chopping.
There is some size starting to build....

02:26.793 --> 02:28.872
Come on. Come on.

02:47.791 --> 02:49.751
- Morning, staff sergeant.
- Morning, sergeant.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.431
Morning, staff sergeant.

02:51.632 --> 02:53.751
- Morning, sergeant.
- Morning, staff sergeant.

02:53.952 --> 02:55.711
Morning, staff sergeant.

03:02.071 --> 03:04.150
Morning, you little prick.

03:18.470 --> 03:22.549
You know what they say. You're only
as old as you feel, staff sergeant.

03:22.750 --> 03:26.349
That's what I'm worried about.
I can't feel a damn thing.

03:31.310 --> 03:35.189
--to the Pacific for our next report,
where a cluster of meteors...

03:36.670 --> 03:40.667
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere
in the early hours tomorrow morning.

03:40.870 --> 03:41.869
Go ahead.

03:42.069 --> 03:45.907
They're expected to strike miles
from land, far into the Pacific Ocean.

03:47.108 --> 03:49.227
- John.
- Oh, God.

03:50.308 --> 03:51.868
What's up, Mike?

03:52.228 --> 03:55.868
Hey. What happened to that picture
of us in Iraq with that camel?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.707
I mean, your girlfriend.

03:58.308 --> 03:59.787
Hey, is this for real?

03:59.988 --> 04:03.706
It's got your signature. l said, "That's
gotta be a mistake. He can't write."

04:03.907 --> 04:07.667
No mistake, John. l did my 20.
I know when to get out.

04:07.867 --> 04:11.106
Come on. You got the box full of
medals, a file full of commendations.

04:11.307 --> 04:13.828
You can have them.
Seems you like interior decorating.

04:14.028 --> 04:17.625
A Marine's got a shelf life, you know?
After that....

04:17.826 --> 04:19.065
What? He spoils?

04:19.267 --> 04:20.786
Something like that.

04:20.986 --> 04:23.506
I'll finish my training assignment
with these Marines.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.226
Get them combat ready.

04:25.987 --> 04:27.786
And then I'll be on my merry way.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.945
You know, we could always use
another lean, mean typing machine.

04:32.145 --> 04:33.865
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

04:34.346 --> 04:36.105
Ugly, slow, soft.

04:38.866 --> 04:40.385
God.

04:41.586 --> 04:43.545
You had to make some
tough calls there, Mike.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.743
Especially that last one.

04:48.785 --> 04:51.624
We all wish your men made it home.

04:53.824 --> 04:55.385
Here we go.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.223
You're expired.

05:05.624 --> 05:06.823
Clear the shelf...

05:07.784 --> 05:09.303
...staff sergeant.

05:21.183 --> 05:22.902
Everything I know is in here, John.

05:40.942 --> 05:44.222
What typically would have been
detected months, if not years, before...

05:44.383 --> 05:46.461
...surfaced in less than four hours.

05:46.662 --> 05:50.382
These images giving some idea of
the rate these meteors are travelling.

05:51.701 --> 05:54.260
Scientists are abuzz,
scrambling to try and understand it.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.661
There's something just
extremely uncomfortable...

05:56.861 --> 05:59.060
...about a man your size
sniffing a flower.

05:59.262 --> 06:01.100
What you want is some hydrangeas.

06:01.302 --> 06:03.860
Popular wedding flower,
come in green, blue.

06:04.021 --> 06:06.341
What colour is
the bridesmaids' dresses?

06:07.741 --> 06:11.340
- Good question.
- You're amazing. Take a whiff. Smell it.

06:12.620 --> 06:13.940
Yes, pretty girl?

06:14.140 --> 06:17.660
For 300 more, she said we could have
sprays of lilies.

06:17.860 --> 06:20.980
Now, l know it's a lot, but it'd be
so beautiful. What do you think?

06:21.181 --> 06:22.701
300 dollars? Goodness gracious.

06:22.901 --> 06:26.659
It's a no-brainer. You're only getting
married once. Worry about 300 bucks?

06:26.860 --> 06:29.699
- Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you.
- Yeah, no worries.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.899
You know what? lt's your day.
Do whatever you want.

06:36.741 --> 06:39.058
I'm gonna hit you with something.
What are you doing?

06:39.258 --> 06:40.258
Busting your balls.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.898
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.

06:42.099 --> 06:43.859
And l can't wait.

06:44.059 --> 06:45.178
I love cake.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.857
Yo, Doc. What you doing?

06:59.058 --> 07:00.056
Skyping back home.

07:00.218 --> 07:03.018
Is that your girlfriend? Damn, she fine.

07:04.338 --> 07:05.897
Doc. My boy.

07:10.019 --> 07:12.136
That's my sister.

07:14.577 --> 07:15.777
Goddamn.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.815
Shoot, man. I'm speaking objectively
here, you know what I'm saying?

07:20.457 --> 07:21.857
All right, no, stop playing!

07:23.577 --> 07:24.817
May I take a message?

07:25.017 --> 07:27.216
Doc, is it all right
if l have one of those first?

07:29.136 --> 07:31.495
You eat it at your own risk.

07:33.256 --> 07:34.736
They're very old.

07:36.777 --> 07:38.696
So do you feel
that you're making progress?

07:40.016 --> 07:42.416
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

07:43.695 --> 07:45.134
I'm sleeping a lot better.

07:45.335 --> 07:47.855
And then also around the firing range
and everything...

07:48.016 --> 07:50.455
...when I first came back
and hear the pop, pop, pop...

07:50.616 --> 07:54.135
...I'd get jumpy and it would mess with
me a bit and a little bit of a setback.

07:54.336 --> 07:56.295
But now it, you know...

07:57.295 --> 07:58.934
...doesn't bother me.

07:59.415 --> 08:00.813
So l think that's progress.

08:01.695 --> 08:04.253
So, what's the story
with my status, doc?

08:04.454 --> 08:07.214
I mean, are you gonna clear me
for combat? Because....

08:07.616 --> 08:09.214
Yeah, l feel good.

08:11.735 --> 08:13.974
Let's meet again next week...

08:15.414 --> 08:17.933
...and we'll discuss it. Okay?

08:19.455 --> 08:23.053
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much, doc.

08:30.533 --> 08:33.572
Harris' girl is making the dude
organise his entire wedding...

08:33.732 --> 08:35.131
...two weeks before we deploy.

08:36.491 --> 08:39.852
I say the chick's busting his balls
like nobody's business.

08:41.972 --> 08:44.372
But he got two weeks to get it done
because we're out.

08:44.572 --> 08:47.890
So l just came by to visit you
one last time before we leave.

08:48.092 --> 08:52.332
And l brought Dad's five iron with me.
And you know what that means.

08:53.453 --> 08:57.211
Me and the boys are gonna
go out tonight, continue the tradition.

08:57.933 --> 09:00.050
Have a good time, you know?

09:01.852 --> 09:03.571
I'll see you soon, bro.

09:07.971 --> 09:09.371
See you soon.

09:12.532 --> 09:14.490
Motown, give me boots.
I'm going skiing.

09:14.651 --> 09:16.171
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.

09:19.171 --> 09:20.209
Here they come.

09:20.410 --> 09:23.249
Don't mess this up, man.
They cannot know that you a virgin.

09:23.450 --> 09:25.929
How do you know l--
Who says I'm a virgin?

09:26.130 --> 09:27.689
We know you are. Look at your face.

09:27.890 --> 09:30.170
What are you telling her?
Telling her what?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.890
Oh, come on, you guys.
You're killing me.

09:36.050 --> 09:38.769
That dog gonna hunt! Damn, Daktari,
you can play, man.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.128
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

09:41.330 --> 09:45.129
Shit. How am l supposed to know,
man? It's an American game, right?

09:45.329 --> 09:47.569
Adukwu's our Navy corpsman.
He's like a medic.

09:47.770 --> 09:50.848
No, not like a medic. Medic is
the Army. I'm a Navy corpsman.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.888
Well, sailor, yes.

09:53.090 --> 09:54.528
I came here to become a doctor.

09:59.290 --> 10:00.688
Slow down.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.288
That's like number five.

10:03.489 --> 10:04.769
How many have you had?

10:04.969 --> 10:06.247
No, I'm good.

10:06.447 --> 10:09.567
- Now, this guy here, Mr. Lenihan...
- Hey.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.407
...his mom signed
so he could join up at 17.

10:12.568 --> 10:16.127
And l look after him because this boy
don't know his ass from a hot rock.

10:21.248 --> 10:24.406
- Not on my truck, dude!
- Easy, now. Easy, buddy.

10:24.607 --> 10:26.646
- Oh, yeah!
- Not on my truck.

10:26.847 --> 10:29.766
- Toast. To Lenihan.
- To Lenihan!

10:29.967 --> 10:31.486
Good luck, rookie.

10:31.687 --> 10:32.846
Retreat, hell!

10:33.046 --> 10:36.127
--emergency developing throughout
NASA and the space community.

10:36.327 --> 10:40.246
We now know that meteors will land
off the coasts of eight different cities...

10:40.446 --> 10:42.245
...and that number could keep rising.

10:42.446 --> 10:45.205
Evacuations now under way
in Southern California...

10:45.406 --> 10:47.605
...moving the population back
from the coastline.

10:47.966 --> 10:50.805
But a lot of curious people
are clamouring for views.

10:51.005 --> 10:56.124
- What are you doing up so early?
- Lieutenant. Still gotta get used to that.

10:59.805 --> 11:01.284
This thing right?

11:01.486 --> 11:03.445
- Here. You want me to do it?
- lt's tricky.

11:04.806 --> 11:08.164
They gotta be parallel to the deck.
That's the whole thing with these bars.

11:08.365 --> 11:10.523
- Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, okay?
- Okay.

11:10.684 --> 11:12.364
- Call me later.
- I'll call you later.

11:16.324 --> 11:18.685
That's my baby. All right.

11:36.283 --> 11:38.322
Let's go! Move!

11:42.684 --> 11:45.682
Quick time! March!

11:49.203 --> 11:53.562
Marines! lnto the trucks and report
to your company! Let's go!

11:53.763 --> 11:55.041
Move it! Let's move!

11:55.242 --> 11:56.642
Move it!

11:56.842 --> 11:59.281
- Load them up!
- Move it!

11:59.482 --> 12:01.521
What's going on, first sergeant?

12:03.162 --> 12:05.162
Meteors hitting off California now...

12:05.882 --> 12:08.322
...but they got the whole
goddamn base being mobilised.

12:08.522 --> 12:12.761
I'm bringing you back to the company,
Mike. They need you.

12:13.242 --> 12:14.880
First sergeant.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.120
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.

12:23.002 --> 12:25.601
- You heard we might be mobilising?
- Yes, sir.

12:25.802 --> 12:27.160
Moving you up to squad leader.

12:27.321 --> 12:29.520
It's a big responsibility,
but you can handle it.

12:29.721 --> 12:30.999
Thank you, sir.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.600
Staff Sergeant Beck is being replaced
by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.400
What do you know about him?

12:38.081 --> 12:40.560
He's a very dedicated Marine.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.001
Don't bullshit me, corporal.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.718
What'd you hear about his last tour?

12:46.520 --> 12:49.439
Just the grimy details
that everybody else already knows.

12:49.919 --> 12:52.279
But at the end of the day,
you're our lieutenant...

12:52.440 --> 12:54.679
...and we take our orders from you, sir.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.798
You're assigned to 1st Platoon
under Second Lieutenant Martinez.

13:02.838 --> 13:06.678
His platoon sergeant's on leave,
so you're gonna have to suck it up.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.358
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant
right up here, 1 o'clock.

13:10.519 --> 13:11.877
He's a kid, Mike.

13:12.439 --> 13:14.197
Right out of officer training school.

13:14.399 --> 13:16.917
He's only been with us a month,
but I think he's sharp.

13:17.917 --> 13:21.117
It's just an evacuation, buddy.
He's in charge.

13:21.358 --> 13:23.756
Just keep an eye on him, huh?

13:27.039 --> 13:28.558
Just don't lose my paperwork.

13:29.397 --> 13:31.477
- Lieutenant.
- Good afternoon, staff sergeant.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.396
- Happy to meet you.
- Thank you, sir.

13:33.557 --> 13:37.396
We're being called in to help with
an evacuation? For these meteors?

13:37.557 --> 13:38.996
I assume so.

13:39.157 --> 13:41.796
Whatever it is, I'm happy to finally
get out in the field.

13:42.037 --> 13:44.275
At approximately 4:42 am
Pacific Standard Time...

13:44.437 --> 13:45.796
...the meteors impacted....

13:45.957 --> 13:48.636
Who the hell took my tortellini?
You got tortellini?

13:48.838 --> 13:49.915
This some kind of drill?

13:50.076 --> 13:53.395
Get ready, man. Get ready.
It's serious. Okay?

13:56.397 --> 14:00.675
Meteors continue to fall off the coast
of California, Ireland, Bay of Bengal....

14:00.876 --> 14:01.875
Corporal. Corporal.

14:02.076 --> 14:03.555
- Corporal. Corporal.
- Yeah?

14:03.756 --> 14:05.514
It's probably just a training exercise.

14:05.715 --> 14:08.754
No, man. They're shifting Nantz
into our unit. Something's going on.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.914
The guy wants out of the Marine
Corps and now we're stuck with him.

14:12.116 --> 14:13.795
- Stavs!
- You got tortellini?

14:14.835 --> 14:16.714
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.

14:16.916 --> 14:19.474
He went into that compound alone
and killed 10 insurgents.

14:19.636 --> 14:22.273
- That's what you heard, Lenihan?
- Chill out.

14:22.434 --> 14:24.873
Yeah. Johnson in Foxtrot told me
that he was going on--

14:25.034 --> 14:26.274
Don't worry about it.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.073
- Let's go, this is serious.
- What the hell did l do?

14:29.235 --> 14:31.313
Nantz got a couple guys killed
on his last tour.

14:31.475 --> 14:32.514
What?

14:32.675 --> 14:34.794
That's the story.
Lockett's brother was one.

14:34.995 --> 14:39.112
So l know you didn't know, but
just don't-- No, don't worry about it.

14:39.513 --> 14:41.712
Looks like we're getting into
some heavy shit.

14:41.953 --> 14:45.472
It's been my experience, lieutenant,
heavy shit is highly overrated.

14:45.673 --> 14:48.913
Look, staff sergeant, let's just be clear.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.153
I know your rep,
know what you've done.

14:51.314 --> 14:53.672
This is my platoon.
These are my men.

14:53.872 --> 14:56.992
- Not gonna have a problem, are we?
- No problem, sir. She's all yours.

14:57.352 --> 15:00.272
It appears our initial assumptions
were wrong.

15:02.753 --> 15:04.591
Listen up!
Once you get your weapon...

15:04.832 --> 15:08.271
...get your gear, get your munitions,
move outside!

15:10.511 --> 15:13.551
We got white chocolate rap from my
man. That should finish the new mix?

15:13.712 --> 15:17.031
National Guard troops have flown in
to evacuate beach areas...

15:17.232 --> 15:20.910
...and we have word
the military is now deploying.

15:21.112 --> 15:23.950
That's us. That's us! That's us!

15:24.112 --> 15:27.390
- Calling military for a meteor shower?
- l don't know why they're happy.

15:27.591 --> 15:29.149
--a meteor that just hit the ocean.

15:30.831 --> 15:34.151
Large plumes of smoke are coming
up. Visibility is getting worse as we....

15:34.351 --> 15:36.471
These objects were
completely undetected...

15:36.632 --> 15:38.350
...until they entered our atmosphere.

15:38.551 --> 15:41.790
NASA estimates that they are not
hitting the water at terminal velocity.

15:41.991 --> 15:44.508
They're slowing down before impact.

15:46.430 --> 15:50.349
These objects are falling into
the ocean in tightly packed clusters...

15:50.550 --> 15:53.268
...10 miles outside
of a major population centre.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.390
Thermal imaging
from the Hubble shows us...

15:55.590 --> 15:59.229
...that within each cluster is a central
object much larger than the others.

15:59.430 --> 16:02.428
Now, these central objects
are all the same geometric shape.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.868
They appear mechanical in nature.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.548
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.588
We are in Threatcon Delta.
That's right.

16:10.789 --> 16:13.947
Come on. All units, gear up.

16:14.148 --> 16:15.628
Be ready to move.

16:16.428 --> 16:17.628
Combat situation.

16:17.829 --> 16:19.829
It's what I've been training for.

16:22.468 --> 16:25.708
l am told that one of the Coast Guard
cutters has issued a mayday.

16:25.909 --> 16:28.267
It is difficult to see, and--
Oh, my gosh!

16:28.468 --> 16:31.867
There is just another meteor
that just hit the ocean...

16:32.067 --> 16:34.706
...and it's the closest one yet,
right behind those cutters.

16:34.908 --> 16:37.146
Two or three meteors just impacted.

16:38.148 --> 16:39.227
Shit.

16:39.388 --> 16:42.626
Do you have any more information
in the studio? Oh, my God.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.666
Kate? Kate? Are you hearing us?

16:47.947 --> 16:51.465
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!
- Kate, are you still hearing us?

16:51.946 --> 16:55.986
Yes, Jean, I can hear you. Everyone,
move out. Get out of the way.

16:56.506 --> 16:58.307
What is that?
What is that in the water?

16:58.508 --> 17:01.465
I can't really get a good look,
but it appears there's something--

17:01.626 --> 17:05.385
I'm looking through the people, trying
to determine exactly what this is.

17:05.586 --> 17:09.263
I don't even know.
It's like shadowy figures.

17:09.465 --> 17:13.145
Maybe five, six, seven.
I can make out maybe eight figures.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.464
- What the hell is that?
- Holy shit!

17:16.664 --> 17:19.384
- Look at that!
- Stavs, you see that?

17:19.545 --> 17:23.104
I'm gonna head back now. Everyone
needs to get out of here right now.

17:29.585 --> 17:32.702
I think that we've gotta leave, Jean.
I'm gonna head back now.

17:33.384 --> 17:34.862
Oh, my God!

17:38.023 --> 17:40.663
Go! Let's go. Go, go!

17:40.904 --> 17:43.744
Corporal Grayston and Corporal lmlay
are both expert marksmen...

17:43.905 --> 17:45.863
...as well as strong fire team leaders.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.823
We also have PFC Lenihan,
who is our second best marksman...

17:49.023 --> 17:53.022
- ...behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.
- What's your take on this, Specs?

17:53.624 --> 17:55.582
I don't know. Extraterrestrial?

17:55.783 --> 17:57.782
- Do you mean like from space?
- No, Imlay.

17:57.983 --> 18:00.182
- From Canada.
- Always got jokes, don't you, Stav?

18:00.383 --> 18:02.943
All right, first squad, line it up.
Bring it in. Let's go!

18:04.743 --> 18:06.022
As you may have heard...

18:06.223 --> 18:09.342
...Staff Sergeant Nantz will be
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.

18:09.543 --> 18:11.462
We're lucky to have him aboard.

18:12.143 --> 18:15.621
All right. Here's the situation, Marines.
We're facing an unknown enemy.

18:16.382 --> 18:19.501
We don't know how strong their
force is or what they're capable of.

18:19.701 --> 18:23.141
But one thing we do know
is that we're fighting for our land...

18:23.342 --> 18:26.661
...our families, our home
and our country, goddamn it!

18:26.822 --> 18:30.061
Whatever those things are, let's show
them how Marines fight. Retreat....

18:30.222 --> 18:31.220
- Hell!
- Two-Five!

18:31.381 --> 18:33.300
- Retreat, hell!
- Let's form it up, let's go!

18:44.502 --> 18:46.740
First in, last out, Marines!

18:47.461 --> 18:50.340
Breathe, Lenihan. Breathe.
Your training will kick in.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.379
Thank you, staff sergeant!

18:53.540 --> 18:56.819
- Got something to get off your chest?
- No, it's cool, staff sergeant.

18:57.019 --> 18:59.938
You got a silver star, my brother
came home in a box. I get it.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.659
All stations, this net.
Standby for sitrep.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.060
Enemy elements have advanced
beyond the beach.

19:08.259 --> 19:11.938
Aliens? That's not possible, right?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.618
We'll know soon enough, brother.

19:15.418 --> 19:19.178
One-oh-one tank has been destroyed.
Company beyond the defensive line....

19:19.379 --> 19:23.178
It's in case his head gets blown off,
so they can identify his body.

19:25.138 --> 19:27.378
Be advised, enemy have
heavy assault weapons.

19:27.579 --> 19:30.137
Firepower equal
to high-explosive rounds.

19:32.778 --> 19:36.657
Hey, staff sergeant! Promise me
you won't let me be taken alive...

19:36.859 --> 19:40.256
...by some godless predator
from another world, staff sergeant?

19:41.537 --> 19:43.856
No promises in combat.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.296
Stop screwing around
and keep your head in it!

19:48.139 --> 19:53.217
These units are falling tactically.
Their strategies are coordinated.

19:53.417 --> 19:56.376
Do not underestimate enemy
combat intelligence.

20:03.136 --> 20:05.135
We are not evacuating civilians
fast enough.

20:05.336 --> 20:07.615
I say again, we are not evacuating
fast enough.

20:07.816 --> 20:12.935
All units be advised, there are
friendlies behind enemy lines.

20:13.415 --> 20:15.854
Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.172
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.934
Boys, hold on to something.
Things are about to get rough.

21:34.332 --> 21:37.011
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Out! Go!

21:46.492 --> 21:48.169
Move, move, move!

21:50.050 --> 21:51.609
Form it up!

21:58.730 --> 22:01.609
- What do we got, sir?
- All right, situation is as follows:

22:01.811 --> 22:04.169
Most of Santa Monica's
been cleared of civilians.

22:04.369 --> 22:07.808
We got a defensive line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

22:08.010 --> 22:11.288
Air Force has got Warthogs
and B-52s on deck.

22:11.490 --> 22:16.608
At 1930 hours, they will pound the
entire area from Lincoln to the ocean.

22:17.411 --> 22:18.570
Shit.

22:20.809 --> 22:22.288
We're levelling Santa Monica, sir?

22:22.489 --> 22:24.648
We got an infestation
of God knows what...

22:24.849 --> 22:27.688
...not of this Earth and
we gotta hit them with everything...

22:27.889 --> 22:31.008
...and we gotta hit them hard.
They are a ground-force enemy only.

22:31.208 --> 22:34.367
They have no aircraft, so the Air Force
will tear them a new asshole...

22:34.568 --> 22:36.247
...and we will rule the air.

22:36.447 --> 22:38.408
- You said "most civilians," sir?
- Affirmed.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.807
Getting distress calls,
sending squads out.

22:41.009 --> 22:43.847
Golf, you take Santa Monica
to Olympic.

22:44.049 --> 22:46.127
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.

22:46.327 --> 22:48.407
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.

22:48.608 --> 22:51.047
Lieutenant Martinez,
I want you to break off a squad...

22:51.208 --> 22:52.366
...and a machine gun team.

22:52.568 --> 22:56.326
Proceed west from Lincoln
to a police station located here...

22:56.527 --> 22:58.606
- ...at Venice and Amarosa.
- Venice and Amarosa.

22:58.807 --> 23:00.127
Police were overrun.

23:00.327 --> 23:04.607
Got a distress call that civilians are
still there. We don't know how many.

23:04.807 --> 23:06.766
Just gather survivors,
then you radio in.

23:06.967 --> 23:09.725
We'll have helicopters
in the area to evacuate you out.

23:09.926 --> 23:13.605
Now, be advised, you got exactly
three hours before our bombs drop.

23:13.806 --> 23:16.765
And make no mistake, they will drop,
with or without you.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.205
Get those civilians,
get the hell out of there...

23:19.406 --> 23:22.566
...and you kill anything
that is not human.

23:22.767 --> 23:24.805
Let's go! Let's get it done!

23:25.126 --> 23:28.285
Captain, this is not a drill. You hold
that line, you understand me?

23:28.486 --> 23:29.485
Yes, sir.

23:38.845 --> 23:41.443
--from the coastline into suburbs.
Golf company is overrun.

23:41.644 --> 23:43.884
Lima company
requesting immediate air support.

23:44.085 --> 23:47.004
Civilians are being stranded
behind enemy lines.

23:47.204 --> 23:48.484
Hang on, One!

23:48.685 --> 23:50.083
Fire in the hole!

24:04.364 --> 24:07.483
Troops are amassing in every coast,
along every major coastline.

24:07.684 --> 24:09.524
The UN has called
an emergency sitting...

24:09.684 --> 24:12.442
...in an attempt to establish
a means for sharing resources...

24:12.643 --> 24:14.482
...and intelligence across the globe.

24:14.683 --> 24:16.242
Watch out, go!

24:18.243 --> 24:20.842
This way?
Where are we supposed to go?

24:22.003 --> 24:23.562
Jesus Christ.

24:35.042 --> 24:38.201
Marines, anything beyond this point,
consider to be hostile.

24:38.402 --> 24:39.961
All right, nice and easy.

24:49.561 --> 24:50.921
Clear.

24:53.802 --> 24:55.601
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship.

24:56.002 --> 24:58.040
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.959
Lieutenant. How many civilians
we gotta get out of that police station?

25:02.120 --> 25:05.039
I have no idea, Guerrero.
Just stay focused.

25:10.881 --> 25:13.480
- What the hell's that? What is that?
- This is insane.

25:13.681 --> 25:15.118
Yo, eyes open.

25:15.319 --> 25:18.038
An unidentified enemy
has breached our coastlines...

25:18.239 --> 25:20.758
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

25:20.959 --> 25:23.878
At this point, there are many more
questions than answers.

25:24.079 --> 25:28.240
Right now, one thing is clear:
The world is at war.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.718
Eyes open.

25:32.958 --> 25:34.918
You see something, Simmons?

25:35.998 --> 25:37.278
Can't see shit.

25:39.559 --> 25:43.077
- Kerns, you see a cross street?
- Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

25:43.518 --> 25:46.557
Police station's
about one klick northwest of here.

26:18.158 --> 26:20.436
- Twelve o'clock!
- Hundred metres front.

26:20.636 --> 26:23.435
- This is Echo 6, we need immediate--
- Turn your radios down.

26:32.477 --> 26:35.675
- lt's just a dog.
- Just a little doggy. Come here.

26:35.875 --> 26:36.954
- lt's just a dog.
- Dog.

26:37.155 --> 26:38.235
- Dog.
- Dog.

26:38.436 --> 26:40.434
What's his name, huh? "Glenn."

26:40.595 --> 26:42.834
Kidding me. Who's the idiot
naming dogs these days?

26:43.035 --> 26:44.834
What do you wanna call him, Fido?

26:45.635 --> 26:46.874
Watch out!

26:53.595 --> 26:55.513
- Where's it coming from?
- l don't know.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.153
Lenihan, watch your head!

26:57.355 --> 26:58.474
On the roof!

27:01.715 --> 27:03.674
Enemy fire! Eleven o'clock!

27:03.874 --> 27:06.552
- They're on the roof! On the roof!
- Cover him!

27:10.993 --> 27:13.592
Twenty-five metres!
Twenty-five metres!

27:14.953 --> 27:17.713
- Lieutenant!
- Left flank, on the roof!

27:17.954 --> 27:19.753
Covering, covering!

27:21.514 --> 27:23.232
- We gotta move now!
- Lockett!

27:23.433 --> 27:25.472
- Yes?
- Get me an exit down that alley!

27:25.673 --> 27:28.352
Yes, sergeant!
Kerns, Motown, let's go!

27:31.952 --> 27:33.311
Get up! Come on!

27:33.512 --> 27:34.831
Falling back!

27:35.032 --> 27:36.392
Let's go, come on!

27:36.594 --> 27:38.591
Enemy fire! Watch your head!

27:39.192 --> 27:40.911
- Where'd they come from?
- Fall back!

27:41.112 --> 27:43.071
Enemy fire, keep your head down!

27:43.272 --> 27:44.551
It's all over the damn place!

27:44.751 --> 27:45.792
What do you see?

27:45.992 --> 27:47.630
I don't know, man. I don't see shit.

27:47.952 --> 27:49.191
How do we get out of here?

27:49.392 --> 27:51.591
- Lieutenant, where's the exit?
- I'm working on it!

27:51.792 --> 27:54.670
- Shit, we're boxed in!
- I'll take a position by the wall! Go, go!

27:54.870 --> 27:56.589
- Move out!
- Ambush!

27:59.031 --> 28:00.070
I don't have him!

28:00.511 --> 28:01.510
I'm hit!

28:02.751 --> 28:04.110
Cover me, Lockett!

28:14.790 --> 28:17.309
- Man down, man down!
- It burns!

28:20.910 --> 28:21.950
Shit!

28:22.870 --> 28:24.190
I got you, Guerrero!

28:29.268 --> 28:32.908
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

28:38.229 --> 28:39.309
I've got you covered!

28:39.510 --> 28:42.068
We have an exit!
Everybody, move out! Move out!

28:42.269 --> 28:43.267
Move, move!

28:43.428 --> 28:47.348
Staff sergeant, we got an exit! Come
on, we're going! Come on, let's go!

28:48.709 --> 28:56.027
Fall back, fall back!

29:03.508 --> 29:05.867
Go, keep moving! Keep moving!

29:08.588 --> 29:09.987
Lorenzo!

29:10.187 --> 29:11.347
Move, move, move!

29:11.868 --> 29:13.706
Keep moving, keep moving,
keep moving!

29:14.546 --> 29:16.786
I can't see shit!

29:19.667 --> 29:22.666
Shit, shit, shit!
Imlay!

29:22.868 --> 29:24.786
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

29:26.107 --> 29:27.466
U.S. Marines, coming in!

29:27.948 --> 29:29.666
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?

29:29.866 --> 29:32.265
Kitchen's clear!
The kitchen's clear, lieutenant!

29:32.746 --> 29:34.545
Get on that window! Are we clear?

29:34.746 --> 29:37.025
Put the wounded in the kitchen!

29:37.226 --> 29:39.304
Kerns, Lockett, secure the back
of this house.

29:39.465 --> 29:41.824
- Yes, staff sergeant.
- Staff sergeant, we're on it!

29:44.466 --> 29:46.784
Doc, how long
till they're able to move?

29:46.945 --> 29:49.264
Ten minutes. Ten minutes,
staff sergeant. Ten minutes.

29:49.466 --> 29:52.144
You want me?
Come get some! I'm right here!

29:52.345 --> 29:53.743
What do we got, lmlay?

29:53.945 --> 29:56.064
I got nothing.
I can't see a goddamn thing.

29:56.224 --> 29:58.504
- With this smoke, it's zero visibility.
- You're dead!

29:58.665 --> 29:59.904
Stow that shit, Simmons!

30:00.064 --> 30:02.422
You'll get shot before
you're able to kill any of them.

30:02.583 --> 30:03.623
Your orders, sir?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.384
I led us right into that ambush.

30:07.944 --> 30:10.584
- Mottola, anyone on command?
- No, sir.

30:10.784 --> 30:14.944
- We need to find answers to get out.
- You're in charge, sir. Your orders?

30:19.662 --> 30:21.143
Let's radio that evac to meet us.

30:21.304 --> 30:23.421
Civilians or no,
we gotta get these wounded out.

30:23.582 --> 30:25.862
- Roger that.
- Hey, guys, guys. Where's Lenihan?

30:26.263 --> 30:28.062
I didn't see him with us. Where is he?

30:28.264 --> 30:29.262
- Lenihan?
- Lenihan?

30:29.464 --> 30:30.823
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?

30:31.024 --> 30:33.063
- Lenihan!
- I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

30:33.263 --> 30:36.222
Imlay, Harris, on me.
Let's get this shit out of here.

30:36.422 --> 30:38.621
I'll package the wounded.
Rally on 10th Street.

30:38.783 --> 30:41.060
Be prepared to move.
We're moving out soon.

30:42.302 --> 30:43.741
Shit.

30:51.862 --> 30:53.341
Mottorola.

30:53.902 --> 30:55.500
Mottorola?

30:57.421 --> 30:59.941
Oh, come on. Mottorola, you copy?

31:00.301 --> 31:01.341
Lenihan, where are you?

31:01.501 --> 31:02.900
Staff sergeant?

31:03.102 --> 31:06.659
Jesus Christ. l had to turn my radio
off. These things are everywhere.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.861
We're coming for you.
What's your location?

31:09.061 --> 31:12.180
I'm in the laundry room
of some apartment complex.

31:12.381 --> 31:14.060
It's like three storeys--

31:22.980 --> 31:27.099
What colour is it? Lenihan. Lenihan?

31:42.740 --> 31:44.218
Shit.

31:50.178 --> 31:53.578
Lenihan.

31:57.898 --> 31:59.337
Shit.

32:08.697 --> 32:10.176
So smooth....

32:11.736 --> 32:13.337
Smooth is fast.

32:14.298 --> 32:15.297
Shit.

32:22.337 --> 32:23.616
Oh, shit.

33:12.774 --> 33:14.453
- Lenihan!
- Lenihan, lower that weapon!

33:16.254 --> 33:18.013
What the hell--?

33:26.853 --> 33:28.573
Keep on firing!

33:30.972 --> 33:32.812
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that thing?

33:32.973 --> 33:36.292
It's not dead. They don't die. I've hit it
a hundred times. They don't die.

33:36.492 --> 33:39.572
Get separated from the unit again,
I'll find you and shoot you myself.

33:39.773 --> 33:42.252
Imlay, drop a grenade in that pool.
Let's move!

33:42.453 --> 33:44.373
Come on, l got you. l got you.

33:45.532 --> 33:46.811
Frag out.

33:58.573 --> 34:00.091
Street's clear.

34:01.612 --> 34:02.891
Get down, get down, get down.

34:03.172 --> 34:06.770
- What's happening? What's going on?
- All right, we're good. Come on.

34:11.411 --> 34:13.850
- lt's Lenihan.
- Yo, Lockett.

34:14.051 --> 34:18.130
You owe me $5. l told you, a virgin
ain't gonna die till he get him some.

34:18.330 --> 34:19.929
Move to the police station?

34:20.130 --> 34:23.248
- All right, let's move. Let's move.
- Move it. Move it out.

34:35.690 --> 34:37.967
- Where'd that come from?
- Door's open at the bank!

34:38.168 --> 34:39.408
Take care of him.

34:39.609 --> 34:40.849
Where'd the shot come from?

34:41.531 --> 34:43.728
- Kerns!
- Door's open on the bank! Let's move!

34:43.889 --> 34:46.489
Come on, let's go! Move! Move it!

34:47.650 --> 34:50.808
Stavrou, you got front. Stavrou,
cover front. Harris, cover front!

34:51.489 --> 34:53.328
Roof's clear, roof's clear!

34:53.489 --> 34:54.688
I got it. I got it covered.

34:54.889 --> 34:57.288
Harris! Find me where
that shot came from, guys!

34:57.489 --> 34:59.488
Imlay, get eyes up on that roof,
all right?

34:59.689 --> 35:01.887
- Cover the roof!
- Roof's clear, roof's clear!

35:02.090 --> 35:03.249
Lockett, on me!

35:03.449 --> 35:05.448
Did anybody even see
where that came from?

35:07.048 --> 35:08.048
Doc, how serious?

35:08.248 --> 35:10.928
Third degree thermal burns
on his neck and his face, sir.

35:12.288 --> 35:13.808
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

35:14.288 --> 35:15.486
Shit.

35:19.247 --> 35:21.365
- Hostiles, 12 o'clock!
- Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

35:21.566 --> 35:23.566
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!

35:24.847 --> 35:25.847
Prepare to fire!

35:26.767 --> 35:28.206
Hold it, hold it!

35:28.408 --> 35:29.886
Friendlies, sir.

35:30.887 --> 35:34.526
- Shit.
- Friendlies. Let's get them in.

35:37.566 --> 35:38.565
Get over here.

35:42.446 --> 35:45.085
Move. Move to the back.
Let's go. Come on, get.

35:45.447 --> 35:48.926
- What's your unit?
- 40th, lD.

35:49.207 --> 35:50.686
Where's the rest of your unit?

35:50.886 --> 35:53.165
Everyone else is either dead
or missing.

35:54.005 --> 35:55.844
I picked up Air Force here.

35:56.046 --> 35:58.124
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos,
Air Force.

35:58.326 --> 36:02.324
61st Wing, intel, surveillance,
recon division.

36:02.485 --> 36:04.604
Tech sergeant? What the hell
are you doing here?

36:05.005 --> 36:08.244
We were tracking enemy transmissions
about 12 klicks south of here.

36:08.445 --> 36:10.764
They ambushed us
like they knew our freaking address.

36:12.124 --> 36:13.124
I'm the only one left.

36:13.325 --> 36:17.043
I found these guys on the way to the
safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.

36:17.764 --> 36:19.803
You ready to use that weapon,
tech sergeant?

36:20.004 --> 36:24.004
With all due respect, staff sergeant,
I didn't get this far off of my good looks.

36:24.203 --> 36:26.002
- I'm ready for payback.
- Outstanding.

36:27.244 --> 36:30.083
Lieutenant, bird inbound,
25 minutes, sir.

36:30.284 --> 36:33.163
Roger that.
Let's get to that police station.

36:33.364 --> 36:35.843
All right, let's get Simmons and move.
Let's go!

36:39.604 --> 36:43.121
Cover our flanks, Mottorola!
To the right, in that building!

36:43.323 --> 36:44.361
Watch your feet!

36:44.563 --> 36:45.802
There's the police station.

36:45.963 --> 36:48.683
Let's get those civilians
and get back to the F.O.B.!

36:51.083 --> 36:52.882
Gotta rock, gotta rock!

36:58.522 --> 36:59.682
Come on, come on, come on.

37:00.362 --> 37:02.562
I'll stay with our wounded,
wait for the medevac.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.281
I'll go for civilians.
Kerns, Dever, on me.

37:05.443 --> 37:08.361
- Mags, mags. I need mags.
- All right.

37:08.761 --> 37:12.161
Santos, when that bird arrives,
I'll need your help on this stretcher.

37:12.921 --> 37:14.680
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

37:16.321 --> 37:17.720
Door. The door.

37:18.322 --> 37:19.599
- Elevator right.
- Clear!

37:19.802 --> 37:21.240
Elevator right.

37:21.681 --> 37:24.360
Second elevator, clear! No pulse.

37:25.801 --> 37:27.200
Door left.

37:27.881 --> 37:28.880
It's locked.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.319
- What's your name?
- Harper.

37:30.520 --> 37:33.240
- I'm gonna need you on this stretcher.
- Bird incoming, sir!

37:33.440 --> 37:36.079
Roger that. lmlay, pop smoke!

37:40.201 --> 37:42.079
- Door locked.
- Door left.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.198
Radios off.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.558
Move.

38:24.638 --> 38:26.877
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

38:28.758 --> 38:30.677
- How many of you?
- Five of us, three kids.

38:30.878 --> 38:32.355
Kerns, kids!

38:34.797 --> 38:36.236
- Let's move!
- Let's go, let's go!

38:36.438 --> 38:39.237
All right, let's get ready to move!
Let's get it up!

38:41.717 --> 38:43.396
- Here we go! Let's move!
- Aye, sir!

38:43.597 --> 38:46.276
We got room for four and that is it!
That is it.

38:46.477 --> 38:48.715
- Get your wounded on! Move it!
- Oh, yeah, baby.

38:48.916 --> 38:50.995
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.

38:51.196 --> 38:52.795
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.

38:54.276 --> 38:56.155
I'll work on that mix for you!

38:56.356 --> 38:59.636
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're
gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!

39:00.077 --> 39:01.316
Give them hell!

39:03.436 --> 39:04.914
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, man.

39:05.755 --> 39:08.194
You just had to get out of the shit.

39:08.396 --> 39:10.113
- You take care of yourself!
- l will.

39:10.315 --> 39:12.074
I'll see you soon, partner.

39:13.075 --> 39:14.914
- That's it.
- We have civilians coming out!

39:15.115 --> 39:17.315
- We can't take them, we got no room!
- Make room!

39:17.516 --> 39:19.395
We can't! Now, get back, sir!

39:19.594 --> 39:22.593
Fall back.
Move back, move back, move back!

39:26.994 --> 39:29.193
Wait! Kids, kids!

39:43.275 --> 39:45.153
Get back to the police station!

39:50.114 --> 39:52.312
Backtrack, everybody! Come on, back!

40:00.753 --> 40:04.592
They have air power. Again, enemy
has air support. We have a bird down.

40:04.793 --> 40:06.032
Damn it!

40:06.232 --> 40:07.951
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.

40:08.152 --> 40:10.951
We've disengaged back into a
police station. We have civilians.

40:11.151 --> 40:13.311
I say again, we have civilians.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.711
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.
Nothing gets in, you understand?

40:20.032 --> 40:23.550
We got a body. Do you think you could
get rid of it so the kids don't see it?

40:23.751 --> 40:25.430
What do you want?
Where should we go?

40:25.591 --> 40:26.629
Dever.

40:26.831 --> 40:28.470
Set up back there, okay?

40:30.872 --> 40:33.270
Come on, you guys. Take the back.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.429
Stay away from the window, all right?

40:35.631 --> 40:38.789
Are there gonna be more choppers?
Did you guys call any in?

40:40.349 --> 40:43.949
I'm sure they're gonna come for us.
They know where we are.

40:46.390 --> 40:48.629
Shit.
You okay? You all right?

40:48.791 --> 40:50.189
- I'm good. Yeah.
- You sure?

40:50.390 --> 40:53.789
- You didn't get hit or nothing?
- No, I'm good, man. I'm good.

40:55.030 --> 40:57.469
Man, they're gone. They're gone.

40:57.669 --> 41:00.028
Everybody's gone.
Lenihan, Guerrero, Grayston.

41:00.429 --> 41:02.187
Grayston. Grayston had kids.

41:02.348 --> 41:04.149
Didn't deserve that.
Didn't deserve that!

41:04.310 --> 41:05.989
He didn't deserve to go out like that!

41:06.190 --> 41:09.949
Neither do you! You hear me?
You're gonna make it through this!

41:10.789 --> 41:14.347
All right? You're gonna get out of here.
You're gonna marry Cherise.

41:14.549 --> 41:16.307
And you're gonna be her problem...

41:16.508 --> 41:19.866
...because I'm done taking care
of your sorry ass, you got that?

41:22.508 --> 41:25.347
All stations, this net. Sitrep as follow:

41:25.508 --> 41:28.427
Enemy aircraft
number four fleets at this time.

41:28.627 --> 41:31.827
Be advised, more entering battle
space Los Angeles from ocean...

41:31.988 --> 41:34.266
...on bearing 2-niner-7-5-0.

41:34.467 --> 41:36.626
They got air support too.

41:37.427 --> 41:40.066
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.

41:41.068 --> 41:42.985
So much for ruling the air.

41:44.426 --> 41:46.586
There's no time for that, lieutenant.

41:46.787 --> 41:48.546
Those bombs are gonna drop.

41:49.387 --> 41:51.426
And we're in the blast radius.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.945
Top of my goddamn class.

41:55.387 --> 41:59.504
And l get out in combat in the middle
of that shit? Goddamn it!

41:59.706 --> 42:02.145
I already lost four
of my goddamn men!

42:02.866 --> 42:03.945
Four good men.

42:04.106 --> 42:06.184
Who would go to hell and back
for you, sir.

42:11.186 --> 42:12.345
- Have you?
- Yes.

42:12.546 --> 42:15.383
You're not the first to lose men.
You won't be the last.

42:15.585 --> 42:17.824
Now, put that away.
You understand me?

42:18.024 --> 42:20.463
Right now your men are
awaiting orders.

42:21.464 --> 42:24.545
Now, you can go left, you can go right.
I don't give a damn.

42:25.105 --> 42:27.024
Just make a decision.

42:28.626 --> 42:30.104
Lieutenant.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.903
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.

42:33.104 --> 42:34.903
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.

42:35.105 --> 42:37.304
Command says it's like nothing
they ever seen.

42:37.504 --> 42:39.184
We gotta find a way out.

42:39.384 --> 42:41.503
We gotta get to that F.O.B.

42:41.703 --> 42:44.462
You're right. We gotta move.

42:44.664 --> 42:47.621
Let's get these people safe.
Lockett, Kerns!

42:47.822 --> 42:50.303
I need you to set up
an observation post on the roof.

42:50.503 --> 42:52.743
We're gonna move by foot,
so we gotta move fast.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.462
Scan for hostiles,
find the best route out of here.

42:55.623 --> 42:57.062
All right, sir.

42:58.503 --> 42:59.502
Lieutenant.

43:04.502 --> 43:08.461
Officials are now saying any civilian
within 10 miles of the coast...

43:08.662 --> 43:10.181
...should try to make their way...

43:10.342 --> 43:12.182
...to a military
forward operating base, F.O.B.

43:13.822 --> 43:16.182
This is the safest place
that you could be right now.

43:16.383 --> 43:20.141
Now, the military has set up a line
of defence to try to protect civilians.

43:21.061 --> 43:24.260
Take a look at you, make sure
you're okay, all right? Good. Okay.

43:24.462 --> 43:27.940
Just look at this. There you go.

43:28.141 --> 43:30.980
- Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon.
- Okay, thank you.

43:31.181 --> 43:32.422
- No problem.
- Thank you.

43:35.541 --> 43:38.020
- Joe Rincon.
- Staff Sergeant Nantz.

43:38.221 --> 43:39.340
This is my son, Hector.

43:39.541 --> 43:43.059
We all wanted to thank you
for coming to get us.

43:43.981 --> 43:45.140
Yeah.

43:45.340 --> 43:47.979
Hey, Hector. We leave no man behind.

43:48.980 --> 43:51.059
So you here
when the police got overrun?

43:53.300 --> 43:56.980
Right. Well, long as you're both okay.

43:58.660 --> 44:00.139
Hey, you all right, man?

44:00.740 --> 44:02.419
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

44:02.620 --> 44:03.939
Okay.

44:05.140 --> 44:07.539
If you-- If you need him
to do anything...

44:08.219 --> 44:10.858
- ...you know.
- I'll let you know.

44:13.499 --> 44:14.978
Aye-aye, sir.

44:15.419 --> 44:16.699
Aye.

44:17.499 --> 44:18.979
Thank you.

44:23.098 --> 44:25.778
We got two dozen hostiles
about 300 metres out.

44:25.978 --> 44:29.417
Lieutenant, we got two dozen hostiles
300 metres north, over.

44:31.578 --> 44:34.137
It's like those things are on overwatch,
just like us.

44:35.659 --> 44:38.576
That one out front looks like
the leader. Now they got leadership.

44:38.737 --> 44:40.537
So do ants, Kerns.

44:41.017 --> 44:43.337
You think those things get scared too?

44:44.377 --> 44:48.377
Probably just like us. They're probably
just grunts that get told to go fight.

44:48.577 --> 44:53.416
Come on. Find us a way out of here,
Marine, because we're sitting ducks.

44:53.617 --> 44:56.055
They dragged them out of the house,
into the street...

44:56.216 --> 44:58.456
...put them in perfect order
before they shot them.

44:58.657 --> 45:00.136
They shot them right in the head.

45:00.297 --> 45:02.657
Chief, do we have any idea
why this is happening?

45:02.857 --> 45:06.096
Well, it's clear there has been no
attempt at any kind of communication.

45:06.256 --> 45:08.375
No demands, nothing like that.

45:08.576 --> 45:11.054
So, obviously,
they are here for our resources.

45:12.936 --> 45:14.614
When you invade a place
for resources...

45:14.775 --> 45:16.614
...you wipe out
the indigenous population.

45:16.775 --> 45:18.735
Those are the rules
of any colonisation.

45:19.216 --> 45:22.375
And, right now,
we are being colonised.

45:22.975 --> 45:24.495
Brave kids.

45:24.696 --> 45:28.694
They're my nieces. My sister and her
husband are away on vacation.

45:31.494 --> 45:35.694
Thing is, they live in Arizona.
I see them once or twice a year.

45:36.614 --> 45:38.773
And now I may be all they have left.

45:39.535 --> 45:41.974
- You have kids?
- No.

45:42.174 --> 45:43.973
Neither do I.

45:45.054 --> 45:48.333
I used to regret that,
but maybe it was for the best.

45:48.534 --> 45:51.053
Of course, our planet's surface
is 70 percent water.

45:51.214 --> 45:53.773
So again, and l have to stress this,
without certainty...

45:53.973 --> 45:57.213
...the leading hypothesis remains
that their objective, their target...

45:57.413 --> 45:58.412
...is our water.

45:59.133 --> 46:02.212
- Shit.
- There ain't gonna be nothing left.

46:03.213 --> 46:05.613
- l think l got a way out of here.
- What'd you say?

46:05.773 --> 46:07.613
Right here, look. 200 metres out.

46:07.853 --> 46:09.852
- What's right behind that backside?
- Bus.

46:10.254 --> 46:12.692
- Lieutenant, we got a bus.
- Roger that.

46:12.892 --> 46:16.051
So the men on the roof saw a bus.
They think it could be operational.

46:16.252 --> 46:18.931
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.

46:20.332 --> 46:21.972
It's miles to the operating base...

46:22.213 --> 46:24.411
...and those bombs
are gonna drop in an hour.

46:24.652 --> 46:25.612
We gotta move fast.

46:26.733 --> 46:28.332
Bus is a big target.

46:28.493 --> 46:29.691
I made the call.

46:30.652 --> 46:32.491
It's my responsibility.

46:32.811 --> 46:34.290
Stavrou, Harris.

46:34.491 --> 46:37.330
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.
If it runs, get it back here.

46:37.572 --> 46:41.330
- You know how to hotwire a bus?
- Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir.

46:41.811 --> 46:42.850
Ladies first.

46:46.251 --> 46:47.649
Two hundred metres.

46:47.851 --> 46:50.570
Go down, there's the cars burnt out,
there's a pickup truck.

46:50.770 --> 46:52.170
Right back behind there.

46:53.891 --> 46:56.809
We have a situation.
Y'all need to follow me.

46:58.691 --> 47:01.609
Harris found it out here.
Y'all gotta see this thing.

47:11.089 --> 47:13.449
Weapon looks like it's been
surgically attached.

47:13.649 --> 47:15.689
Talk about commitment to cause.

47:21.809 --> 47:23.368
Shit.

47:25.328 --> 47:28.008
- You gotta be kidding!
- Corporal. Corporal, hold it.

47:28.809 --> 47:31.568
Let me shoot this thing, staff sergeant.
That weapon's hot.

47:31.809 --> 47:32.809
Let me just shoot it.

47:32.970 --> 47:34.127
- Doc.
- Yes, staff sergeant.

47:35.208 --> 47:36.367
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

47:37.928 --> 47:40.047
We need to know exactly
where to hit this thing...

47:40.208 --> 47:41.927
...so we don't waste all our ammo.

47:43.809 --> 47:45.326
Maybe I can help.

47:45.528 --> 47:46.967
I'm a veterinarian.

47:59.288 --> 48:00.845
Sure you wanna do this?

48:01.087 --> 48:03.686
I was more sure when
I was standing over there.

48:04.488 --> 48:06.444
We gotta figure out
how to kill these things.

48:06.605 --> 48:09.726
Otherwise, we won't last another
five minutes out there, okay?

48:11.207 --> 48:13.086
Let's peel this back.

48:16.326 --> 48:19.526
- Look at this, we got a organ here.
- Jesus Christ, look at that.

48:20.287 --> 48:21.604
- I got another one.
- Me too.

48:21.765 --> 48:24.683
Does it have some sort of
cognitive mechanism? Anything?

48:25.005 --> 48:27.723
There's no frontal lobe,
no temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.

48:27.966 --> 48:29.605
The cranial vault is unlike anything.

48:29.806 --> 48:31.205
- Oh, shit.
- What?

48:31.366 --> 48:32.885
- You see what I'm seeing?
- What?

48:33.085 --> 48:35.244
The ones that were just
on the roof aren't on it.

48:35.405 --> 48:37.365
There's about two dozen
coming out the door.

48:37.605 --> 48:39.363
They're on the street heading this way.

48:39.525 --> 48:41.923
- Lieutenant, we got movement up here.
- Roger that.

48:42.084 --> 48:44.563
We have contact 300 metres out.
We gotta cut quick.

48:51.806 --> 48:53.603
Lieutenant, we gotta move!
What do we do?

48:53.763 --> 48:56.163
- Shit's hitting the fan. Gotta move.
- Staff sergeant.

48:56.363 --> 48:58.483
Come on, how do you kill this thing?

49:06.884 --> 49:08.402
Goddamn it, Stavs.

49:08.723 --> 49:10.721
- I lost them.
- You lost them?

49:11.402 --> 49:14.402
Lieutenant, they're gone.
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

49:15.563 --> 49:18.283
- We got a breach.
- Got a breach on the north entrance!

49:18.483 --> 49:19.522
They're inside.

49:19.682 --> 49:22.001
I'm gonna gather everyone
by the doors on the south side.

49:22.163 --> 49:23.682
We're right behind you.

49:23.883 --> 49:25.320
What was that?

49:25.522 --> 49:27.841
- Adukwu, you go with her.
- Yes, staff sergeant.

49:28.162 --> 49:31.080
- Imlay, got an HE grenade round?
- Never leave home without it.

49:31.282 --> 49:33.561
You cover that hall to the rear.
Buy me some time.

49:33.763 --> 49:36.362
They start coming,
you blast the hell out of them.

49:36.722 --> 49:38.881
Hey, Harris.
Where's that goddamn bus?

49:39.082 --> 49:41.841
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy scout.
Come on, let's go.

49:43.601 --> 49:47.400
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby!
Newark! Represent!

49:47.601 --> 49:49.719
Lieutenant, we've got the bus,
heading back.

49:49.921 --> 49:52.120
Okay, guys, the bus is en route!
Bus is en route!

49:52.320 --> 49:54.200
Thirty seconds till we move out!

50:00.361 --> 50:02.879
Imlay, give me a sitrep.
I need an update on the breach.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.880
Report back, over.

50:10.521 --> 50:11.839
We're running out of time.

50:21.559 --> 50:22.759
Move!

50:26.560 --> 50:28.238
Contact!

50:29.238 --> 50:30.677
They've breached.

50:35.878 --> 50:36.917
This is our last shot.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.158
Got it.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.238
Right here.

50:47.238 --> 50:50.437
That's gotta be it. It's dying.

50:54.877 --> 50:58.077
That's how we kill this thing, to
the right of where the heart would be.

50:58.239 --> 50:59.557
- Got it.
- I got three more!

51:03.878 --> 51:05.436
Let's get out of here.

51:08.797 --> 51:12.156
Get them on the bus! Get them
on that bus! Let's go, let's go!

51:17.156 --> 51:19.394
- Get on.
- Get underneath.

51:20.476 --> 51:21.516
You okay?

51:25.277 --> 51:29.155
Heads up. Cover your sectors of fire.
Heads up!

51:32.596 --> 51:36.673
Marines, concentrate firepower to
the right of where the heart would be.

51:36.835 --> 51:38.194
Yes, staff sergeant.

51:39.075 --> 51:40.513
That's how we kill these things.

51:42.396 --> 51:43.954
All right, remember your training.

51:44.116 --> 51:46.115
We got a hostile warbird,
thousand metres out.

51:46.275 --> 51:47.555
Everybody keep your eyes up.

51:55.593 --> 51:57.433
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.

51:57.634 --> 51:58.994
Roger that.

51:59.434 --> 52:02.194
It should be about
six miles to the F.O.B.

52:02.395 --> 52:04.194
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.

52:04.554 --> 52:06.312
If we stay on these side streets.

52:06.514 --> 52:09.153
Air Force is gonna level this area
in 40 minutes.

52:15.153 --> 52:18.353
Get us to the forward operating base.
Fast.

52:32.273 --> 52:33.992
What the hell is that?

52:34.832 --> 52:35.992
Stavrou, stop the bus.

52:51.472 --> 52:52.550
Everyone, get down.

53:07.712 --> 53:10.469
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November. Sitrep to follow.

53:10.670 --> 53:12.630
Go ahead, Foxtrot-Two-November.

53:12.830 --> 53:14.990
Enemy aircraft.
They're lighting up the sky...

53:15.190 --> 53:17.709
...heading east towards
downtown Los Angeles.

53:17.910 --> 53:18.989
Copy that.

53:21.670 --> 53:22.948
They're tracking our signals.

53:26.468 --> 53:29.068
Mottola, turn off that radio!
They're tracking our signals!

53:29.269 --> 53:31.429
All radios off! Cell phones, everything!

53:33.230 --> 53:34.828
Give me your radio.

53:38.390 --> 53:40.307
Mottola. Give me your radio.

53:43.667 --> 53:44.667
Where you going?

53:44.828 --> 53:46.907
- Staff sergeant!
- Where the hell is he going?

53:55.149 --> 53:59.667
- We gotta get off this bus, all right?
- Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!

53:59.867 --> 54:02.866
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!

54:03.067 --> 54:06.066
It's getting closer. Hey, it's on my six!

54:12.906 --> 54:14.586
A hundred metres!

54:21.666 --> 54:22.826
Oh, my God.

54:25.467 --> 54:27.185
Everybody, get down!

54:40.427 --> 54:42.264
Holy shit.

55:20.063 --> 55:21.943
- What was that?
- Is he all right?

55:22.143 --> 55:24.502
- Did he make it out?
- Staff sergeant?

55:40.222 --> 55:42.942
- There he is.
- Staff sergeant's alive!

55:43.142 --> 55:45.181
- Yeah, he's alive!
- There he is!

56:18.101 --> 56:20.459
That aircraft was unmanned,
Lieutenant.

56:21.220 --> 56:22.700
Drone.

56:29.780 --> 56:32.618
That was some real John Wayne shit,
staff sergeant.

56:40.460 --> 56:41.858
Hey.

56:43.059 --> 56:45.899
I can't afford to lose you.
Neither can these men, all right?

56:47.539 --> 56:49.299
Yeah. They're your men.

56:52.018 --> 56:53.577
All right, staff sergeant!

56:56.777 --> 56:58.297
That's how you do it!

56:58.498 --> 57:00.579
- That's retreat, hell!
- That's right.

57:00.979 --> 57:03.337
Who the hell's John Wayne?

57:13.617 --> 57:15.135
Everybody, eyes open!

57:15.338 --> 57:16.936
Stay alert!

57:17.896 --> 57:19.696
Thank you for that.

57:23.977 --> 57:25.415
It's nothing.

57:26.696 --> 57:28.496
What's that mean, "retreat, hell"?

57:32.296 --> 57:36.736
During World War I, an officer from
our regiment was ordered to retreat.

57:36.936 --> 57:41.453
He said, "Retreat, hell.
We just got here."

57:45.336 --> 57:47.695
You should have the doc
take a look at that.

57:48.416 --> 57:49.854
I thought you were a doctor.

57:50.456 --> 57:52.894
Animals and aliens only.

57:53.536 --> 57:55.613
I'll put it on my to-do list.

57:56.295 --> 57:57.533
Thank you.

58:07.295 --> 58:10.294
Excuse me, staff sergeant. Did you
say that was an unmanned drone?

58:10.495 --> 58:11.813
Correct.

58:12.814 --> 58:15.573
They must have one hell of
a command-and-control system.

58:16.254 --> 58:18.693
If NORTHCOM didn't agree with you,
I wouldn't be here.

58:18.893 --> 58:20.253
Why?

58:21.533 --> 58:25.293
My mission was to provide AIS
with a strike package.

58:25.614 --> 58:26.974
A strike package?

58:27.174 --> 58:30.732
Yeah, coordinates for a missile strike
on a command-and-control centre.

58:30.933 --> 58:34.692
But the asset fell off
the grid and we lost them.

58:44.212 --> 58:47.532
All side streets are blocked.
Our only choice is to take the freeway.

58:48.572 --> 58:50.812
All right. Well, it's your call.

58:51.012 --> 58:52.651
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.

58:53.772 --> 58:57.491
We don't wanna be in this area
when these bombs start to fall.

59:20.130 --> 59:22.289
Try to miss at least
one of the cars, Stavrou.

59:24.091 --> 59:25.609
Just keep driving.

59:26.530 --> 59:28.049
Off ramp is one mile ahead.

59:34.650 --> 59:35.688
Jesus.

59:36.970 --> 59:38.368
Look out.

59:44.209 --> 59:47.528
The ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.

59:52.849 --> 59:55.648
All right, Robertson exit,
half a click away.

59:57.369 --> 59:59.007
Look out! Incoming, 12 o'clock!

01:00:07.847 --> 01:00:09.647
- You okay?
- Harper!

01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:19.445
Tank's drawing enemy fire!
It's a good time to move!

01:00:19.647 --> 01:00:21.806
I'll suppress the fire,
you take the civilians!

01:00:22.007 --> 01:00:23.926
Secure this exit, Imlay!

01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:29.846
Imlay, get me a defensive line
on that vehicle!

01:00:33.408 --> 01:00:36.045
- Move, move, move!
- Let's go! Come on.

01:00:36.247 --> 01:00:38.685
- Let's go!
- Come on, stay down, stay down!

01:00:43.647 --> 01:00:46.566
Just keep everybody calm.
We'll be right back, all right?

01:00:46.766 --> 01:00:48.405
All right. Safety first, buddy.

01:00:51.524 --> 01:00:56.165
Martinez, if we get the civilians to that
helo, they take cover, rappel down.

01:00:56.366 --> 01:00:59.005
I got a dozen up on the bridge.
They're moving down.

01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:02.445
Lieutenant! Tank's out!
Nothing's stopping them now!

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:08.923
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make it
to that helo without cover fire.

01:01:09.924 --> 01:01:11.883
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!

01:01:12.084 --> 01:01:14.203
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:20.244
Get the civilians down, all right?
Move!

01:01:25.284 --> 01:01:26.723
Come on!

01:01:30.043 --> 01:01:31.482
About a 30-foot drop. Let's go.

01:01:31.684 --> 01:01:35.963
Get behind the bus!
Now, now, now! Get behind it!

01:01:36.404 --> 01:01:39.203
Kids first! Around the body,
bring them down one at a time.

01:01:39.403 --> 01:01:40.722
Roger that.

01:01:42.364 --> 01:01:43.802
Imlay!

01:01:44.602 --> 01:01:46.482
Get your team
up on that garbage truck!

01:01:46.682 --> 01:01:50.162
Staff sergeant, cover us up front!
Stavs, you're with me! On me now!

01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:55.521
We're gonna run behind that helicopter
and we're gonna rope down, all right?

01:01:55.802 --> 01:01:56.961
The girls will be first.

01:01:57.123 --> 01:02:00.002
I promise you nothing's
gonna happen. Okay? Stay down!

01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:04.801
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles,
maybe more!

01:02:04.962 --> 01:02:07.401
Four hundred metres
and closing fast!

01:02:07.882 --> 01:02:10.201
Cover, cover!
What the hell are you doing?

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.920
You guys need another gun.

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:15.719
Three o'clock. Up on the bridge,
Santos. Up on the bridge.

01:02:15.921 --> 01:02:17.640
Incoming!

01:02:24.801 --> 01:02:26.360
Ten o'clock!

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.319
- Reloading!
- Aim for the leader!

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.479
Hell, you can take all the room
you want.

01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:41.840
Mottola, move, move, move!

01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:46.479
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go, go! Run now, run!

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.119
Keep running! Don't stop, run!
Run, run, run!

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.878
- Get in there!
- Cover me!

01:03:00.717 --> 01:03:03.518
- I'm going for the .50 cal!
- Hurry up!

01:03:09.199 --> 01:03:10.798
Get some, Lockett.

01:03:21.758 --> 01:03:23.876
- Shit.
- What the hell is that thing?

01:03:24.078 --> 01:03:25.557
I'm engaging!

01:03:28.798 --> 01:03:32.555
You'll be okay, all right? It's okay.
Listen to me. You're going to be okay.

01:03:32.757 --> 01:03:35.595
I got you. I will not let anything
happen to you, all right?

01:03:41.676 --> 01:03:42.876
Shit!

01:03:44.477 --> 01:03:46.235
Man down!

01:03:46.637 --> 01:03:49.635
You're gonna be okay. Hold on,
hold on! Keep going. Hold on!

01:03:50.116 --> 01:03:51.755
Keep looking up!

01:03:59.076 --> 01:04:00.515
Oh, God!

01:04:00.756 --> 01:04:02.474
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:02.676 --> 01:04:05.435
Get the ant that's controlling
that thing!

01:04:08.756 --> 01:04:10.075
Lockett, get off your ass!

01:04:16.035 --> 01:04:17.234
It's turning this way!

01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:20.234
It's about to hit the fan, guys.
Get out now! Move!

01:04:20.434 --> 01:04:21.993
Santos, come on!

01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:24.313
- Come on!
- I'm stuck.

01:04:24.514 --> 01:04:25.752
Go!

01:04:26.915 --> 01:04:28.673
- What are you doing?
- Go!

01:04:30.195 --> 01:04:31.633
Imlay!

01:04:42.553 --> 01:04:43.753
Where's Stavrou?

01:04:48.474 --> 01:04:49.912
Mottorola! How many down?

01:04:51.552 --> 01:04:53.952
Two down, staff sarge! One to go!

01:04:54.152 --> 01:04:56.472
Look at me, look at me. Look, look.
Be good, okay?

01:04:56.673 --> 01:05:00.311
- It's gonna be fine, okay? You ready?
- Lieutenant, C-4!

01:05:02.553 --> 01:05:04.112
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

01:05:05.033 --> 01:05:06.510
Let's do it.

01:05:07.751 --> 01:05:08.871
Kerns!

01:05:15.192 --> 01:05:16.711
Covering!

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.389
All right, dough is good to go!

01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:31.310
- Go!
- Covering!

01:05:36.472 --> 01:05:38.828
Damn it! We've lost the detonator.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.869
- You all right?
- Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.990
- Mottorola!
- Dad!

01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:53.229
You're okay, Hector! You're okay.

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:54.748
Hold on!

01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.908
- I need bandages from the first aid kit.
- Sir! Sir!

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:02.468
It's okay!

01:06:09.428 --> 01:06:10.987
Oh, my God!

01:06:11.828 --> 01:06:12.827
All right.

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:29.547
We gotta get you to a medevac.

01:06:29.747 --> 01:06:31.186
Doc!

01:06:35.188 --> 01:06:36.187
Oh, shit, man!

01:06:36.348 --> 01:06:38.028
- We need some cover!
- Damn it, I'm out!

01:06:38.189 --> 01:06:40.387
- Got another mag, Lockett?
- They kicking our ass!

01:06:40.547 --> 01:06:42.785
You're getting pinned down,
staff sergeant!

01:06:42.987 --> 01:06:45.186
Marines, you're getting pinned down!

01:06:45.946 --> 01:06:48.345
- We're not leaving you.
- Staff sergeant, get them out!

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.506
- Lieutenant, I am not leav--
- Get them out!

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:52.666
- No, I'm not leaving you!
- Get them out!

01:06:52.867 --> 01:06:53.865
No! Not again!

01:06:56.907 --> 01:06:59.465
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.

01:07:00.386 --> 01:07:02.345
Give this to my wife...

01:07:02.546 --> 01:07:05.145
...and get them off
this goddamn freeway.

01:07:08.785 --> 01:07:10.225
That's an order.

01:07:13.304 --> 01:07:14.823
Yes, sir.

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:19.425
Right behind you.

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:28.544
Cover the lieutenant!

01:07:31.624 --> 01:07:32.743
Hey, I'm out!

01:07:38.584 --> 01:07:40.183
They're closing in!

01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:44.863
Here we go.

01:07:50.622 --> 01:07:52.862
This is Lieutenant William Martinez...

01:07:53.063 --> 01:07:56.422
...Echo Company, 2nd Battalion,
5th Marines. Hoorah!

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.258
We're still half a klick
inside the bombing zone.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.618
Move to live, Marines.

01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:12.818
Did he just leave the lieutenant
back there to die?

01:09:13.019 --> 01:09:14.618
Sure looked that way.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:17.298
And this is the guy
in charge of us now?

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:19.377
Let's move.

01:09:22.298 --> 01:09:26.417
Hey, those are our jets.
We're still in the fight.

01:09:27.978 --> 01:09:30.537
All right, we're clear of the bomb zone.

01:09:31.018 --> 01:09:32.537
Let's tighten this place down.

01:09:32.738 --> 01:09:34.337
Bombs drop in six minutes.

01:09:34.538 --> 01:09:36.417
Santos, Kerns, on me.

01:09:36.618 --> 01:09:40.216
Let's see if there are any comms.
All right? Hardwire only.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.696
- Corporal Harris, we clear?
- We're clear!

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.775
- Do you have a hard line in here?
- Over there.

01:10:07.896 --> 01:10:09.495
Now, my son's an optimist.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:14.615
When this first happened, he said,
"Why don't we go try to talk to them?

01:10:15.896 --> 01:10:17.855
Maybe they wanna be friends."

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.574
Hector? Hey.

01:10:22.775 --> 01:10:25.773
We're gonna go get some food
and water for your dad, okay?

01:10:26.414 --> 01:10:27.854
It's okay.

01:10:28.775 --> 01:10:30.094
And what'd you tell him?

01:10:30.295 --> 01:10:31.774
I said:

01:10:32.376 --> 01:10:34.734
"You know, if they're chasing
and shooting us...

01:10:34.934 --> 01:10:37.214
...they're probably not good friends."

01:10:40.614 --> 01:10:43.532
I should've followed directions
and gone to the F.O.B.

01:10:43.733 --> 01:10:47.053
I should've never stayed at the police
station, but I was scared, man.

01:10:49.214 --> 01:10:51.174
I made all the wrong decisions.

01:10:51.374 --> 01:10:53.534
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

01:10:54.734 --> 01:10:56.492
You made a call.

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:59.332
I'd do the same thing
to protect my Marines.

01:11:05.133 --> 01:11:08.292
- I had a situation my last tour.
- Yeah?

01:11:09.452 --> 01:11:12.691
There was no right call. You went left
or you go right, it didn't matter.

01:11:15.932 --> 01:11:17.451
But you're alive.

01:11:17.653 --> 01:11:19.412
Yeah, I survived.

01:11:21.612 --> 01:11:23.251
But I wasn't supposed to.

01:11:25.652 --> 01:11:27.491
Staff Sergeant Nantz....

01:11:36.012 --> 01:11:38.130
You promise to save my son?

01:11:45.451 --> 01:11:48.249
Staff sergeant, we have
a hardwired connection!

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:53.530
Doc, keep him warm.
Sun is going down.

01:11:54.491 --> 01:11:56.170
This will keep you warm.

01:11:56.571 --> 01:12:00.689
We're estimating that 20 cities in 17
countries are now under full attack.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:04.569
It's obvious the enemy is attempting
to cut us off from one another.

01:12:04.769 --> 01:12:07.849
Is there any more information
at this time, Professor Stavert?

01:12:08.049 --> 01:12:10.729
New data shows that they're using
our water as their fuel...

01:12:10.889 --> 01:12:12.968
...and our ocean levels
are already decreasing.

01:12:13.169 --> 01:12:15.969
They are using it to power their ships,
their machinery...

01:12:16.169 --> 01:12:19.967
...possibly their own bodies. It's the
composition of our water that's unique.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.407
It's in a liquid state. No other
locations in our known universe...

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:26.127
...have liquid H2O
anywhere near their surface.

01:12:26.328 --> 01:12:29.808
I just saw a field report that said
they will use our sewage systems...

01:12:30.009 --> 01:12:33.246
- ...to follow our water to their ships.
- How'd you get that to work?

01:12:33.407 --> 01:12:37.287
These things are everywhere. There's
one off the coast of 20 countries.

01:12:37.489 --> 01:12:40.007
They're calling it
the command-and-control centre.

01:12:41.088 --> 01:12:43.727
- That's the thing you were tracking?
- Yeah.

01:12:43.928 --> 01:12:47.567
So you're saying that's the thing
that's controlling the drones?

01:12:47.769 --> 01:12:52.205
Yeah. And if we wipe it out,
we take out their air power.

01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:56.487
These bombs better work.

01:12:56.688 --> 01:12:58.847
- Let's move it.
- Bring him through here.

01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:01.967
- Set him down.
- How much time we got?

01:13:02.727 --> 01:13:03.766
One minute.

01:13:06.806 --> 01:13:10.045
Air Force about to lay some pain
on those extraterritorial bastards.

01:13:13.006 --> 01:13:15.125
- All right, Two-Five, retreat....
- Hell!

01:13:15.326 --> 01:13:17.166
- Retreat....
- Hell!

01:13:18.646 --> 01:13:19.606
Here we go.

01:13:19.767 --> 01:13:22.125
Come on.
Let's fry these sons of bitches.

01:13:22.326 --> 01:13:24.764
We get to the F.O.B.
after these bombs drop, get ammo.

01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:28.045
And some goddamn reinforcements.
Some goddamn tanks.

01:13:32.925 --> 01:13:34.765
- Ten.
- Gotta be strong, okay?

01:13:34.965 --> 01:13:36.363
Nine.

01:13:36.564 --> 01:13:38.163
Eight.

01:13:38.364 --> 01:13:39.604
Seven.

01:13:39.805 --> 01:13:41.284
Six.

01:13:41.485 --> 01:13:42.804
Five.

01:13:43.365 --> 01:13:44.723
Four.

01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:47.043
Three....

01:13:48.164 --> 01:13:50.004
Shit. Everybody, brace!

01:14:10.202 --> 01:14:12.002
- They should've dropped.
- What the hell?

01:14:12.203 --> 01:14:15.722
Wouldn't we have felt that from here if
they'd dropped? We would've felt them.

01:14:15.923 --> 01:14:18.042
Would've felt it in Nevada
with that ordnance.

01:14:18.243 --> 01:14:19.681
That clock right?

01:14:19.882 --> 01:14:21.083
That's what I got.

01:14:21.284 --> 01:14:24.442
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe we
turned the tide. That's a good thing.

01:14:24.602 --> 01:14:26.922
You damn straight, Imlay.
We was kicking some ass.

01:14:27.122 --> 01:14:29.681
Could they have taken out
the whole Air Force?

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.521
This isn't happening.

01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:32.802
Let's move.

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:35.001
Everybody, up, up. Let's move.
Come on.

01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:37.920
We're in the home stretch, everybody.
We in the home stretch.

01:14:55.161 --> 01:14:57.679
Now we know why
those bombs didn't drop.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.439
They wiped our forward
operating base right off the map.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.240
All clear, staff sergeant!

01:15:05.481 --> 01:15:08.080
All right, let's bring him back here.

01:15:12.119 --> 01:15:13.118
Hang in there, buddy.

01:15:13.319 --> 01:15:15.798
Million-and-one odds
we'd get here in the first place...

01:15:15.999 --> 01:15:20.079
...we get here and there ain't nothing.
I knew Nantz would never get us out.

01:15:22.039 --> 01:15:25.880
- There were thousands of Marines here.
- Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.

01:15:27.558 --> 01:15:29.757
You remind me of my older brother.

01:15:30.519 --> 01:15:32.238
How's that?

01:15:32.879 --> 01:15:35.158
He never smiles either.

01:15:38.479 --> 01:15:39.958
Secure the front with Harris.

01:15:41.878 --> 01:15:43.316
Imlay, anything?

01:15:43.518 --> 01:15:45.476
Nothing.
We only got maps of Santa Monica.

01:15:45.677 --> 01:15:48.157
We need something farther east.
They're all burned.

01:15:48.358 --> 01:15:49.397
Follow me, Imlay.

01:15:54.157 --> 01:15:56.877
All right, here's the
battalion commander's hooch.

01:15:57.037 --> 01:15:59.355
Looking for maps,
anything with an extraction point.

01:15:59.516 --> 01:16:01.236
Staff sergeant.

01:16:10.158 --> 01:16:11.876
I'll be right back.

01:16:17.957 --> 01:16:19.955
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.

01:16:20.116 --> 01:16:22.435
Shows where all the units
were deployed.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:25.955
- What the hell are all these red marks?
- Means they're gone.

01:16:26.155 --> 01:16:29.076
- You mean the units got moved?
- Wiped out.

01:16:29.677 --> 01:16:31.994
- All of them?
- All of them.

01:16:32.195 --> 01:16:33.394
Oh, shit.

01:16:33.596 --> 01:16:37.554
All right. One alternate extraction site
is still operational.

01:16:38.275 --> 01:16:39.914
That's eight klicks.

01:16:40.115 --> 01:16:43.754
Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.

01:16:44.635 --> 01:16:47.314
Adukwu, plenty of weapons around.
Find yourself an M-16.

01:16:47.714 --> 01:16:48.993
Mr. Rincon is dead.

01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:14.233
Wake up, Dad.

01:17:22.152 --> 01:17:24.711
Please help me right now.

01:17:26.553 --> 01:17:28.231
Don't leave me.

01:17:33.553 --> 01:17:35.831
I'm so sorry, Hector.

01:17:39.751 --> 01:17:41.151
I'm sorry.

01:17:42.192 --> 01:17:43.271
No.

01:17:43.432 --> 01:17:47.111
Your dad tried so hard
to stay with you.

01:17:48.551 --> 01:17:50.710
- I'm sorr--
- I don't wanna be here.

01:17:57.391 --> 01:17:58.990
It's okay, bud.

01:18:05.871 --> 01:18:08.629
Your father was a brave man, Hector.

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:21.869
Hector, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy.

01:18:22.071 --> 01:18:24.068
It's okay to cry.

01:18:29.108 --> 01:18:31.268
He loved you very much.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:34.148
Listen to me, Hector.

01:18:35.749 --> 01:18:39.628
I need you to be brave for me.
I need you to be my little Marine.

01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:43.947
Okay?

01:18:45.829 --> 01:18:48.028
We gotta be brave for the others.

01:18:50.749 --> 01:18:52.307
Do you know why?

01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:55.626
Why?

01:18:58.588 --> 01:19:01.027
Because Marines don't quit.

01:19:03.108 --> 01:19:04.506
Do you believe that?

01:19:06.948 --> 01:19:08.107
Say it for me.

01:19:11.107 --> 01:19:14.545
- Marines don't quit.
- Good.

01:19:15.066 --> 01:19:18.906
I'm gonna get you out of here, Hector.
I promise.

01:19:22.387 --> 01:19:25.026
Let's go see the girls, okay? Come on.

01:19:42.266 --> 01:19:45.544
We are not losing one more
of those civilians. Understand?

01:19:47.745 --> 01:19:50.464
You getting us out too, staff sergeant?

01:19:52.545 --> 01:19:54.183
Or are we expendable?

01:20:03.585 --> 01:20:05.263
All right, Lockett.

01:20:06.064 --> 01:20:08.224
You wanna go there, let's go there.

01:20:12.345 --> 01:20:14.942
I commanded men and men died.

01:20:15.183 --> 01:20:19.662
Kids. 19 years old.
The best men I ever led.

01:20:20.383 --> 01:20:25.023
Do you think for one second I wouldn't
rather trade places with them?

01:20:31.022 --> 01:20:33.661
I know you think I got my men killed.

01:20:36.422 --> 01:20:37.861
They're dead.

01:20:39.422 --> 01:20:40.861
I'm here.

01:20:41.663 --> 01:20:44.061
Like the punch line to some bad joke.

01:20:44.303 --> 01:20:46.141
You think I like that?

01:20:46.462 --> 01:20:49.621
Do you think a minute goes by
that those faces aren't right here...

01:20:49.821 --> 01:20:51.900
...seared into my brain?

01:20:55.102 --> 01:20:59.420
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal.
1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.

01:20:59.582 --> 01:21:05.020
Ambruster, William R. Private.
8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.

01:21:05.702 --> 01:21:08.141
Wharton, Jeffrey H.

01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:13.180
Lance Corporal. 8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.

01:21:16.941 --> 01:21:18.419
Lockett...

01:21:21.259 --> 01:21:24.138
...Duane G.

01:21:25.739 --> 01:21:27.299
Corporal.

01:21:28.861 --> 01:21:33.339
1-5-6-8-7-0-9....

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.378
Five-five.

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:40.017
Your brother
was an outstanding Marine.

01:21:42.579 --> 01:21:43.699
He was my friend.

01:21:44.779 --> 01:21:49.459
And I miss him every day.

01:21:52.379 --> 01:21:53.818
And you remind me of him.

01:22:02.777 --> 01:22:04.857
None of that matters right now.

01:22:06.617 --> 01:22:10.377
Because our duty is to keep
moving forwards, to keep fighting.

01:22:11.498 --> 01:22:13.137
That's how we honour your brother...

01:22:13.737 --> 01:22:15.417
...and Lieutenant Martinez...

01:22:15.657 --> 01:22:17.576
...Corporal Stavrou...

01:22:17.777 --> 01:22:19.696
...Lance Corporal Mottola...

01:22:20.537 --> 01:22:21.617
...Hector's father...

01:22:22.456 --> 01:22:25.656
...who picked up a rifle and did what
needed to be done. A civilian.

01:22:25.856 --> 01:22:28.135
So we better damn well step it up.

01:22:28.336 --> 01:22:30.297
Discard any lingering doubt.

01:22:30.857 --> 01:22:33.337
Work fast, work as a unit,
and we will prevail.

01:22:33.577 --> 01:22:35.735
Let's figure out
how we're gonna get out of this.

01:22:35.977 --> 01:22:37.975
Imlay, you come with me.
Get to higher ground.

01:22:38.215 --> 01:22:40.654
The rest of you, find some ammo
and some vehicles.

01:22:40.856 --> 01:22:44.214
Gotta be a few LAV's or armoured
Humvees still operational.

01:22:45.056 --> 01:22:48.135
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.

01:22:51.417 --> 01:22:53.616
You went down fighting.

01:22:59.735 --> 01:23:01.134
Holy shit.

01:23:01.334 --> 01:23:03.254
I wasn't expecting to see all this.

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.454
That don't look good.

01:23:06.694 --> 01:23:07.894
Reinforcements.

01:23:12.014 --> 01:23:14.054
Holy shit.

01:23:15.734 --> 01:23:17.894
They already set up a beachhead.

01:23:18.774 --> 01:23:20.013
All right.

01:23:21.574 --> 01:23:25.572
If that evac site is still operational,
I think we can get behind the line.

01:23:25.773 --> 01:23:27.572
That's gonna be one hell of a ride.

01:23:27.812 --> 01:23:29.652
Yeah, well, that's what we get paid for.

01:23:29.813 --> 01:23:33.291
Everybody move to the LAV now! Go!

01:23:33.494 --> 01:23:35.892
Any station, this net.
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.172
We have 11 passengers.

01:23:37.414 --> 01:23:41.492
Requesting evacuation at alternate
extraction point Charlie.

01:23:41.692 --> 01:23:43.612
Are there any birds in the air? Over.

01:23:43.813 --> 01:23:47.451
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is
Sierra 2-5. Orders are to pull back.

01:23:47.652 --> 01:23:51.571
Get to extraction point Charlie
by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.

01:23:51.772 --> 01:23:54.611
Roger that. 0300, not a minute more.
Out.

01:23:56.612 --> 01:23:58.891
Imlay, ever see what
a Bushmaster chain gun can do?

01:23:59.091 --> 01:24:01.451
- Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.
- Get on it, son.

01:24:01.652 --> 01:24:03.571
Let's do this!

01:24:07.412 --> 01:24:08.850
- No lights, Kerns.
- Roger that.

01:24:09.812 --> 01:24:11.370
Let's move.

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:16.010
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.

01:24:16.211 --> 01:24:17.410
Give them hell.

01:24:17.611 --> 01:24:19.050
Damn right.

01:24:30.129 --> 01:24:32.208
Two minutes till that helo drops.

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.449
Everybody okay?

01:24:39.331 --> 01:24:42.289
All right, Kerns, take a left.

01:24:42.450 --> 01:24:45.568
I want you to go over three blocks,
then you go about five blocks...

01:24:45.769 --> 01:24:47.568
...hang a right, and straight.

01:24:47.809 --> 01:24:50.527
- That should get us to the evac site.
- Yes, staff sergeant.

01:24:52.529 --> 01:24:56.207
- I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett!
- Copy that!

01:24:57.969 --> 01:24:59.729
- We got hostiles.
- What's going on?

01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:02.768
- Let's not wait around and find out.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:25:02.929 --> 01:25:05.648
Got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.

01:25:13.407 --> 01:25:15.087
Know what they say if you hit a deer?

01:25:15.328 --> 01:25:17.006
- Speed up!
- Damn straight!

01:25:22.447 --> 01:25:23.966
- Come on!
- Y'all hold on!

01:25:24.168 --> 01:25:26.607
We're gonna have to go
right through them!

01:25:31.767 --> 01:25:34.445
- You saw that?
- They're going down like bowling pins!

01:25:57.885 --> 01:25:59.364
Kick it out!

01:25:59.685 --> 01:26:02.244
Run that sucker over, man!

01:26:04.486 --> 01:26:05.564
Santos, you okay?

01:26:06.364 --> 01:26:09.123
I got that nasty stuff
all over my mouth, man!

01:26:11.564 --> 01:26:15.243
- It's not funny.
- You let him do you on the first date.

01:26:28.525 --> 01:26:31.083
- Everyone okay?
- Yes!

01:26:32.403 --> 01:26:33.563
Let's get us home.

01:26:39.723 --> 01:26:41.641
Cease fire!

01:26:46.084 --> 01:26:48.363
- Stay close, stay close!
- What are we doing?

01:26:51.883 --> 01:26:55.161
Load them up! Our flight path
won't be clear much longer!

01:26:55.362 --> 01:26:57.241
You're in the middle of the shit,
sergeant!

01:26:57.402 --> 01:26:58.801
What happened to all our air?

01:26:59.001 --> 01:27:02.200
Pulled back to save our assets!
They were blowing us out!

01:27:02.402 --> 01:27:04.001
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

01:27:13.441 --> 01:27:15.360
Let's go, Imlay!

01:27:15.682 --> 01:27:17.321
Son, you okay?

01:27:19.121 --> 01:27:20.440
All right.

01:27:21.801 --> 01:27:24.120
Let's move! Move, move!

01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:27.199
Come on, Harris, let's go!

01:28:07.479 --> 01:28:08.877
Hold on!

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:13.278
- You all right?
- Everybody all good?

01:28:13.478 --> 01:28:15.636
- Girls?
- Everybody okay?

01:28:15.838 --> 01:28:17.397
Hold on tight!

01:28:19.158 --> 01:28:20.316
What happened?

01:28:20.518 --> 01:28:23.636
Pilot said something
was playing hell with our power!

01:28:23.838 --> 01:28:27.076
Staff sergeant! Nine o'clock!

01:28:32.757 --> 01:28:35.795
Santos, you said you were tracking
massive RF signals?

01:28:35.997 --> 01:28:38.476
Could a concentration of them
knock out power?

01:28:40.517 --> 01:28:42.396
Yes, definitely! Why?

01:28:42.757 --> 01:28:45.034
Could be their
command-and-control centre!

01:28:48.236 --> 01:28:49.674
Get me down there!

01:28:49.876 --> 01:28:51.235
What?

01:28:52.317 --> 01:28:54.516
I gotta recon that area!

01:28:54.717 --> 01:28:56.915
No way! It's a suicide!

01:28:57.117 --> 01:29:00.715
Damn it, we're the only ones left!
All the other forces have fallen back!

01:29:00.915 --> 01:29:05.314
We can't land! May not have power
to take off again!

01:29:12.395 --> 01:29:14.675
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.

01:29:15.995 --> 01:29:17.474
Will you get it to her?

01:29:20.675 --> 01:29:21.994
Yeah.

01:29:27.154 --> 01:29:29.713
Hover at 40 feet!

01:29:30.194 --> 01:29:31.553
- Twenty seconds!
- Roger that!

01:29:35.914 --> 01:29:38.273
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.

01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:40.592
Staff sergeant, what the hell
are you doing?

01:29:40.795 --> 01:29:43.674
We're in the clear!
We're almost home, Imlay!

01:29:43.874 --> 01:29:45.872
You're in charge now!

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:49.271
You get these civilians home safe!

01:29:53.393 --> 01:29:55.672
You're the bravest Marine I ever seen,
Hector!

01:29:57.033 --> 01:29:58.512
No!

01:30:40.671 --> 01:30:42.630
Everybody, take cover.

01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:46.989
I told you to stay in that helo.

01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:50.549
Civilians are free and clear.
We were worried about your ass.

01:30:50.909 --> 01:30:53.028
I think the command-and-control asset
is nearby.

01:30:53.589 --> 01:30:55.628
Kerns, how many klicks
to that blackout?

01:30:56.069 --> 01:30:58.188
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.

01:30:58.389 --> 01:30:59.787
Five klicks. All right.

01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:02.389
We're gonna use this overpass
for cover.

01:31:03.629 --> 01:31:04.989
If we take out those drones...

01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:08.547
...our military might have a chance
to get back into this fight.

01:31:08.949 --> 01:31:10.468
Santos...

01:31:10.868 --> 01:31:14.387
...where would you put a command and
control asset if you wanted to protect it?

01:31:15.628 --> 01:31:17.307
- Underground.
- Let's go.

01:31:18.908 --> 01:31:21.908
Everybody, let's move. Come on.
Move, move, move.

01:31:46.347 --> 01:31:47.347
Move.

01:32:39.544 --> 01:32:42.183
They must've gone back up.
Just leads up to the street.

01:32:42.383 --> 01:32:45.343
I thought they were leading us
to the command-and-control centre.

01:32:45.784 --> 01:32:47.182
Damn it.

01:32:51.344 --> 01:32:53.422
Let's go. Back.

01:33:01.702 --> 01:33:03.941
Holy shit!

01:33:04.502 --> 01:33:06.541
Santos!

01:33:21.302 --> 01:33:23.100
They know we're here now.

01:33:33.261 --> 01:33:35.421
That's their command-and-control.

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:43.380
Everybody out now!
Move, move, move! Follow me!

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:47.419
Up here! Up that ladder, go!
Move, move, move! Up that ladder!

01:33:48.219 --> 01:33:50.419
Let's go! Move it up!
Blow that grate, Imlay!

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:52.940
Move, move, move!

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:01.139
We're right over their command asset.

01:34:01.621 --> 01:34:06.177
That's it, all right. Let's move the
concrete slab, 1 o'clock. Let's move.

01:34:08.259 --> 01:34:09.457
Fire in the hole!

01:34:09.658 --> 01:34:11.899
That should give us a couple minutes.

01:34:27.538 --> 01:34:30.497
Laser target, staff sergeant?
We don't have any more jets, though.

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:33.698
They can fire ground-to-ground
missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

01:34:33.859 --> 01:34:36.256
We radio in a strike,
paint the target with the laser.

01:34:36.458 --> 01:34:38.057
- Aye-aye, staff sergeant.
- Hoorah.

01:34:38.257 --> 01:34:41.176
Our best chance at radio reception
is on top of that building...

01:34:41.337 --> 01:34:42.697
...but it's the most exposed.

01:34:42.898 --> 01:34:45.256
I'll do it, staff sergeant.
I'll make the call.

01:34:45.457 --> 01:34:46.857
Santos, you got those codes?

01:34:47.057 --> 01:34:49.016
Air Force strike package coming up.

01:34:50.537 --> 01:34:53.615
You get to high ground. Once you
radio in, they'll track that signal.

01:34:53.817 --> 01:34:55.296
Things are gonna get real hot.

01:34:55.497 --> 01:34:58.695
So once you make that call,
you get the hell out of there, all right?

01:34:59.217 --> 01:35:00.336
You know what that means?

01:35:00.537 --> 01:35:03.576
We're gonna have to hold those
things off till the strike gets here.

01:35:03.777 --> 01:35:05.695
Bingo. Marines...

01:35:07.095 --> 01:35:11.134
...we make our stand here. Let those
bastards know who they're fucking with.

01:35:11.335 --> 01:35:12.335
- Retreat....
- Hell!

01:35:12.535 --> 01:35:13.934
Two-Five.

01:35:24.335 --> 01:35:26.574
- Right of the heart, right?
- Right of the heart.

01:35:27.095 --> 01:35:29.254
They're gonna be coming up
from there. Take two.

01:35:29.455 --> 01:35:31.733
Plant one there and the other one
on the other side.

01:35:31.934 --> 01:35:34.454
- Keep your head down, get it done.
- Doc, watch your back!

01:35:34.654 --> 01:35:36.694
Watch your head! Watch it!

01:35:44.335 --> 01:35:52.732
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?

01:35:52.934 --> 01:35:55.091
Foxtrot-Two-November,
this is Yankee-Tango, over.

01:35:55.293 --> 01:35:58.652
We have a priority fire mission. We've
located an enemy command centre...

01:35:58.894 --> 01:36:02.213
...under grid 885-342.

01:36:02.414 --> 01:36:05.212
We will be lasing. Code 1-2-0.

01:36:05.414 --> 01:36:07.733
I say again, we will be lasing.
Code 1-2-0.

01:36:07.933 --> 01:36:10.372
Copy that.
Time to target, three minutes.

01:36:12.292 --> 01:36:13.290
Staff sergeant!

01:36:14.052 --> 01:36:17.211
We got three minutes!
It's coming in three minutes!

01:36:17.412 --> 01:36:20.132
All right. Let's paint this target.

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:33.690
Hell of a shot, Kerns!
Get your ass out of there!

01:36:35.411 --> 01:36:37.770
Get out of there, Kerns! Shit.

01:36:41.612 --> 01:36:43.490
- Shit!
- Kerns!

01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:48.690
Shit! Shit!

01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:55.490
Doc, Doc! Get to cover now!
Move, move!

01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:57.209
Shit.

01:37:00.208 --> 01:37:01.889
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:04.489
Covering up front!

01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:06.610
- Go, go, go!
- Go on, get in there!

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:10.009
Shift fire left! Shift fire left!

01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:12.609
Right there, right there!

01:37:18.008 --> 01:37:19.287
Got it!

01:37:20.128 --> 01:37:21.887
Sixty seconds left.

01:37:31.288 --> 01:37:33.687
- Lockett!
- Shit!

01:37:37.128 --> 01:37:38.487
Let's go!

01:37:45.728 --> 01:37:47.806
Back in the fight, Santos!

01:37:48.568 --> 01:37:50.327
- Need a little help!
- Covering!

01:37:50.527 --> 01:37:52.486
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!

01:37:52.687 --> 01:37:54.766
- I got it, Doc!
- Covering!

01:38:02.606 --> 01:38:05.166
Where's that goddamn artillery?
Should've hit by now.

01:38:06.606 --> 01:38:08.286
Doc, let's go!

01:38:11.687 --> 01:38:14.006
- Doc?
- Imlay! Imlay!

01:38:22.406 --> 01:38:24.044
Incoming!

01:38:29.206 --> 01:38:30.485
Yes!

01:38:31.286 --> 01:38:33.844
Santos, we got it! We got it!

01:38:35.644 --> 01:38:38.563
Direct hit! Direct hit!

01:38:38.724 --> 01:38:39.964
Staff sergeant, you did it!

01:38:43.365 --> 01:38:44.603
Yes, we got it!

01:38:45.084 --> 01:38:47.484
The strike package. It went through?

01:38:48.085 --> 01:38:50.363
- It came through?
- Yeah! All right, Kerns!

01:38:51.484 --> 01:38:52.843
It's over.

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.802
It's coming up. It's coming up.

01:39:22.522 --> 01:39:24.881
They're trying to get away.

01:39:29.681 --> 01:39:32.882
The goddamn thing can fly,
staff sergeant. It's flying now!

01:39:33.083 --> 01:39:34.201
I'll get you out!

01:39:42.041 --> 01:39:44.520
We gotta protect the laser.
Come on. Come on!

01:39:46.361 --> 01:39:47.840
Santos!

01:39:57.721 --> 01:39:59.160
Son of a bitch!

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.439
- That hurt!
- Cover me, Lockett!

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.839
The drones are pulling it away!
We gotta take it out now!

01:40:16.319 --> 01:40:18.518
Incoming Copperhead!

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.757
They're using the drone
to protect the ship!

01:40:29.159 --> 01:40:30.837
I'm running low on ammo!

01:40:31.038 --> 01:40:32.397
Santos!

01:40:36.519 --> 01:40:39.438
- How is he?
- He's hanging in there, staff sergeant!

01:40:39.638 --> 01:40:41.676
Crazy bastard.
You should've left me there.

01:40:46.158 --> 01:40:47.596
Covering!

01:40:48.477 --> 01:40:49.637
Grenade!

01:40:56.159 --> 01:40:58.556
- Staff sergeant!
- We are not dying here, Lockett!

01:40:58.797 --> 01:41:00.756
You damn right we're not dying!

01:41:02.197 --> 01:41:04.356
It's getting out of range!
I gotta take it down!

01:41:04.557 --> 01:41:06.476
Doesn't have enough punch!
Save that shot!

01:41:15.675 --> 01:41:17.395
Staff sergeant!

01:41:17.596 --> 01:41:18.835
Lockett, you okay?

01:41:19.037 --> 01:41:20.915
Harris, you're gonna be okay.

01:41:44.315 --> 01:41:46.553
There's the last Copperhead.

01:41:50.233 --> 01:41:52.753
Santos, take out that drone!

01:41:55.034 --> 01:41:56.713
Firing!

01:42:12.953 --> 01:42:14.433
- Yeah!
- We did it!

01:42:16.552 --> 01:42:20.312
We did it!

01:42:25.433 --> 01:42:28.192
I can't believe it worked!

01:42:34.071 --> 01:42:35.711
Yeah!

01:42:35.911 --> 01:42:37.471
Staff sergeant, you did it!

01:42:39.671 --> 01:42:42.551
There's nothing controlling
the drones anymore!

01:42:48.872 --> 01:42:50.630
Marines, on me!

01:43:02.592 --> 01:43:04.990
They're retreating. Advance!

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:14.546
You guys saved our lives out there!

01:44:14.747 --> 01:44:16.545
Semper Fi, Two-Five!

01:44:16.787 --> 01:44:20.026
- All right, Two-Five!
- Retreat, hell!

01:44:20.227 --> 01:44:22.786
You kicked ass, staff sarge!
Welcome home!

01:44:23.667 --> 01:44:26.785
- Move! Move! Move!
- Good work, Marines! Outstanding.

01:44:27.345 --> 01:44:29.146
Your civilians are safe.

01:44:29.346 --> 01:44:31.825
Word of how you brought
their ship down...

01:44:31.987 --> 01:44:34.586
...is going out to every army
in every city.

01:44:34.786 --> 01:44:38.625
We're mustering up whatever troops
we can get and going back in.

01:44:38.866 --> 01:44:40.824
So get out of that gear.

01:44:41.385 --> 01:44:42.544
Get some chow in you.

01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:44.784
There's breakfast in the tent.

01:44:44.984 --> 01:44:48.263
You earned it. Hoorah, Two-Five.

01:45:34.742 --> 01:45:36.182
- Get some smoke, Imlay.
- Got you.

01:45:36.383 --> 01:45:38.501
Got grenades over here.
Anybody need?

01:45:38.702 --> 01:45:42.742
- Got frag rounds coming down.
- Imlay, I think you could use this.

01:45:42.942 --> 01:45:45.740
- Got it. HE rounds.
- I need a couple more magazines.

01:45:45.942 --> 01:45:48.101
- Very nice, very nice.
- Everybody got ammo?

01:45:48.301 --> 01:45:49.700
Yes, staff sergeant.

01:45:50.101 --> 01:45:52.501
What do you think you're doing,
staff sergeant?

01:45:53.261 --> 01:45:55.420
We already had breakfast, sir.

01:46:04.141 --> 01:46:05.900
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:07.499
Carry on.

01:46:08.581 --> 01:46:10.539
- Retreat, hell!
- Hoorah!

01:46:11.661 --> 01:46:13.579
This is Bullpen 2-3. Who's with me?

01:46:13.821 --> 01:46:15.981
Morning, Bullpen.
Dog Pound 2-1, on your left.

01:46:16.141 --> 01:46:18.099
Good to hear a friendly voice,
Dog Pound 2-1.

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:20.139
Liberty 1-1,
Snake Eyes joining the fight.

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.979
Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1,
we're on your six.

01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:24.139
- Morning, Dog Pound 2-1.
- Eagle on your right.

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:28.419
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.
Let's take back Los Angeles.
