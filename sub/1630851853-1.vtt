WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:04.637
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.348
Who is it?

00:48.415 --> 00:49.449
Carranza.

04:15.722 --> 04:19.659
THE FRAGILITY OF OUR BODIES

04:45.184 --> 04:46.486
We have to end this, Fede.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.189
The next time I call you
drunk at00 a.m.,

04:51.357 --> 04:52.458
don't answer me.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.604
-Good morning, Vero.
-Good morning.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.342
Wait, Vero.
I have something for you.

05:10.743 --> 05:12.078
-See you.
-Bye, Fede.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.721
-Thanks, Marce.
-See you later.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.137
Damn!

05:54.654 --> 05:55.621
Come on!

05:55.955 --> 05:59.459
Wait! I'm not sure.
Did you see its face?

05:59.926 --> 06:01.327
Come on!
Don't be a chicken.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.664
It looks big but it's a puppy.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.834
We can make a lot of money
with those tires.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.938
-But if you're a chicken...
-I am not! Give it to me.

06:12.472 --> 06:15.308
Okay, look.
It's bread with tomato sauce.

06:16.542 --> 06:21.214
While he is busy at it
I'll go and steal the tires.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.683
Go!

06:39.031 --> 06:40.099
Go get them!

06:54.113 --> 06:55.248
Come on!
Don't be silly.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.187
-Damn!
-You're just a baby.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.726
Your main source
was fired for theft.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.327
That is what
the laboratory says.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.196
I didn't write bullshit.
I checked...

07:10.263 --> 07:11.564
every piece of information
he gave me...

07:11.631 --> 07:13.366
with two different sources.
He was reliable, Pato.

07:13.733 --> 07:14.867
Why didn't you tell me?

07:15.234 --> 07:16.702
Why did I have to learn
about it through Vilna?

07:17.036 --> 07:18.671
Yes, it was Vilna
who noticed it.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.072
You made me look like a fool.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.241
I didn't tell you
because there was no need, Pato.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.644
My source says
he didn't steal anything.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.012
He was fired because of the deal
he didn't accept.

07:26.078 --> 07:27.847
You didn't tell me
because you knew...

07:27.914 --> 07:29.182
I'd cancel your story.

07:29.248 --> 07:31.284
And you were right.
I cancelled your story.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.654
You can't continue
working like this, Vero.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.257
You act
without considering the risks.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.160
Vilna wanted to fire you.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.429
I don't know how I managed
to convince him not to.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.866
You did because I am good.
That is why.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.801
Yes, you are good, Vero.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.237
But you are a time bomb.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.756
Did you see the wire
about the suicide?

08:12.758 --> 08:15.661
A man shot himself
and jumped off a building.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.078
Will you follow up the case?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.581
No, it is all yours.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.186
key rings and flashlights.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.588
Rings for children
and for women.

08:43.556 --> 08:47.326
Flashlights, rings, key rings!

08:47.393 --> 08:49.962
Excuse me.
Can I take a look?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.798
-Of course.
-Do they all have light?

08:53.799 --> 08:55.668
-How much is it?
-It is 20 pesos.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.742
-Thanks.
-Bye.

09:40.546 --> 09:41.914
Hey!

09:54.994 --> 09:57.029
Good morning.
Hi, Laura.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.043
Come in.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.081
Hello.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.617
Hi, come in.

10:23.055 --> 10:26.192
-Could you do it?
-Yes, you were lucky.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.961
The D.A. is a friend
of your father's.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.596
López Correa.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.832
His secretary scanned
the documents to me.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.034
Well, all she could find.
It's not much.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.072
Alfredo Carranza.
Train driver, aged 50.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.374
Married, two children.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.542
-Witnesses?
-Several.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.378
They all said the same.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.446
First they heard the shot,
then they saw him fall down.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.716
One of them even saw him climb
on the ledge, with the gun.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.153
What exactly
are you looking for?

10:54.220 --> 10:56.188
-The letter.
-Here it is.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.991
It is all blurred
because of the rain.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.063
"Nobody is to blame,
except myself."

11:06.098 --> 11:10.236
"I can't stand it anymore.
I killed all nine of them."

11:11.137 --> 11:13.339
I thought I could live
with the guilt...

11:13.406 --> 11:17.977
for the death
of the first eight.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.112
But not with the guilt
for the death of the kid.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.314
Forgive me, all of you.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.264
The corpse was recognized
by Carina Carranza.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.765
The deceased man's sister.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.500
She asked me to stand up...

11:41.567 --> 11:43.636
and read the composition
in front of everyone.

11:44.737 --> 11:45.771
She said I write very well.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.673
I could be a writer
or a journalist.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.241
-What would you like?
-I don't know.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.977
I actually want to be
a firefighter or a singer.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.313
But I'd also like
to be a writer.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.884
-Can I get one?
-Yes, of course.

12:00.152 --> 12:01.821
-What flavor?
-Orange.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.889
-I always have that one.
-I like caramel better.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.000
-How are you?
-Fine. And you?

12:15.334 --> 12:17.069
Very well.
I got a job.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.771
At a sports club cafeteria.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.372
Is the pay good?

12:20.706 --> 12:21.874
It is enough
for the time being.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.576
-I'd like to move out.
-Where do you live?

12:23.976 --> 12:25.945
In Lugano.
At a boarding house.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.280
I can't take Martina there.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.983
-How is Andrea?
-Fine.

12:32.318 --> 12:33.719
We have to tell her, mom.

12:33.786 --> 12:34.954
If you want to keep
seeing the girl,

12:35.020 --> 12:36.956
you'd better not to.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.525
You screwed up, Rafael.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.761
One step at a time.

12:45.564 --> 12:46.966
-Here is your change.
-Thanks.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.169
-It is time to go.
-Is it?

12:51.837 --> 12:53.405
But I've just arrived.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.077
We'll make arrangements
for the weekend, right?

12:58.144 --> 12:59.645
-All right.
-Are those your friends?

12:59.979 --> 13:02.248
Yes, from the boarding house.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.819
-Let's go.
-Bye.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.094
Would they let us play?

13:50.062 --> 13:52.097
I can't even walk.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.533
-Come on, man!
-It's true.

13:55.434 --> 13:56.735
Go and play if you want.
I'm going away.

13:57.603 --> 13:58.704
All right.
Let's go.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.451
-Excuse me. Are you Carina?
-Yes.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.689
My name is Verónica Rosenthal.
Do you have a minute?

14:17.723 --> 14:19.725
Are you a lawyer or a reporter?

14:19.792 --> 14:22.828
-A reporter.
-I am not interested.

14:22.895 --> 14:24.363
I know what you are
going through.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.266
You, reporters, smell blood
and are drawn to it like flies.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.035
I don't know who you talked to
but I'm not like that.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.172
-I'm different from the rest.
-Why?

14:33.572 --> 14:35.241
Because you are woman?
Because you are pretty?

14:36.108 --> 14:37.943
Because I care for your brother.

14:40.112 --> 14:41.580
Why do you care?

14:43.015 --> 14:46.418
I want to know the truth.
That's why I'm here.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.721
I want to know
why he did such a thing.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.056
What do you want to know?

14:52.491 --> 14:54.093
Whatever you want to tell me.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.195
I can't take it anymore.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.698
Alfredo seemed to be strong
but his mind was weak.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.569
It's the company's fault.
The one he was working for.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.639
They should've taken
better care of him.

15:06.705 --> 15:08.474
They shouldn't have let him
get on a train again...

15:08.540 --> 15:09.942
after what happened to him.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.479
Those bastards!

15:16.148 --> 15:19.418
He worked for that company
for 25 years.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.654
This is no way to thank him.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.489
Is there anybody
who can tell me something...

15:23.555 --> 15:25.090
about the accidents, Carina?

15:25.157 --> 15:27.826
One of Alfredo's co-workers?
A friend?

15:29.561 --> 15:31.230
-Lucio.
-Who is he?

15:32.464 --> 15:35.401
A train driver. Like him.
Lucio Valrossa.

15:39.571 --> 15:42.908
I promise I'll do my best
to clear up all this.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.312
If the company is to blame,
they'll pay for it.

15:47.179 --> 15:50.449
They are to blame.
I don't know to what an extent.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.184
But they are to blame all right.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.055
That is really awful.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.024
To hit and kill someone
in the street must be terrible.

15:59.358 --> 16:03.395
This is even worse.
Nine adults and one kid?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.300
What are you going
to write about?

16:09.702 --> 16:12.471
I guess about the miserable life
these people have.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.473
The ones who have
these damn jobs.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.775
They need you
in the kitchen, Paula.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.211
I'm coming.
Will you stay for a while?

16:19.545 --> 16:22.348
-All right.
-Good. See you later.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.516
What's up?

17:02.388 --> 17:03.522
Pili?

17:09.294 --> 17:12.164
-Let me buy you a drink.
-No, it's all right.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.069
-It's no big deal really.
-Put it in my account, Pili.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.873
Fine.
What is your name?

17:25.244 --> 17:29.214
-Agony. And yours?
-Diego.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.156
Do you work around here?

17:38.223 --> 17:39.758
No, I'm a friend
of the owner's.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.130
I work around the corner.
In an architecture firm.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.734
They don't pay any attention
to me in there.

17:48.801 --> 17:52.738
When I talk to my boss,
he doesn't even look at me.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.107
It's incredible.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.410
It happens to me all the time.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.612
Don't you find it boring?

18:01.180 --> 18:02.114
What?

18:03.182 --> 18:06.785
To do all this bullshit
to get laid.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.623
I'm sorry.

19:40.546 --> 19:45.651
Hello? Yes, it's me.
All right, let's do it.

19:45.717 --> 19:48.587
You get me that
and I'll get the rest.

19:49.021 --> 19:53.158
Everything I asked you, right?
Okay, fine. Bye.

19:53.926 --> 19:54.993
Get me some beer.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.243
You aren't drinking?
Are you a teetotaler?

20:12.311 --> 20:14.046
I don't feel like drinking.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.450
It's hard to trust someone
who doesn't drink alcohol.

20:20.619 --> 20:21.887
Did you find anyone?

20:22.221 --> 20:25.991
I saw some boys in the park.
But they are too old.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.726
-How old?
-About sixteen.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.394
They are too old.
They should be younger.

20:29.461 --> 20:32.264
-I'll keep looking.
-Please do so.

20:32.331 --> 20:35.534
Remember they must be brave.
We don't want cowards.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.636
Of course not.
Anything else?

20:37.703 --> 20:39.471
-That's it.
-Thank you, sir.

20:49.982 --> 20:53.485
-Sugar?
-No, just black. Thanks.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.122
Tell me...

20:59.391 --> 21:04.429
how I can help you.
Here it is. No sugar.

21:04.896 --> 21:06.598
I'm writing an article
about the suicide...

21:06.665 --> 21:08.133
of one of your train drivers.

21:09.501 --> 21:11.536
Alfredo Carranza.
He killed himself two days ago.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.039
-On Wednesday.
-Carranza...

21:15.641 --> 21:17.643
That was a real tragedy.

21:17.976 --> 21:20.646
To drive a train
is very stressful.

21:20.712 --> 21:25.884
Not everyone can do it.
It's a beast of 500 tons.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.819
It runs at 100 km per hour.

21:27.886 --> 21:31.690
And carries 600 passengers
per ride, in average.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.126
I can imagine.

21:34.459 --> 21:38.230
Carranza had hit nine people
and was in distress.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.699
Why was he still driving?

21:46.004 --> 21:48.707
Look, we have a protocol.

21:49.708 --> 21:53.512
When a driver goes
through a traumatic situation...

21:53.578 --> 21:56.682
-like the case of...
-Carranza.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.418
Yes, Alfredo.

21:59.751 --> 22:03.488
We immediately get him
a therapist.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.592
To start the proper treatment.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.329
How long had he been in therapy?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.898
I don't know exactly.

22:13.231 --> 22:16.234
Until it is confirmed
whether he can return...

22:16.301 --> 22:18.603
to work or not.

22:18.937 --> 22:21.106
Obviously, he couldn't.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.677
That is not up to me.

22:26.978 --> 22:29.648
-Not up to you.
-Of course not.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.817
Can I have
the name of the therapist?

22:34.119 --> 22:35.587
Unfortunately,
I can't give it to you.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.322
I'm not allowed.

22:38.890 --> 22:42.394
If you are a good reporter,
you'll find it out.

22:43.428 --> 22:45.130
Of course.
Don't worry.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.107
Hi, Carina.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.576
This is Verónica Rosenthal,
the reporter.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.111
How are you?

22:59.177 --> 23:03.515
I'd like to ask you something.
Alfredo was in therapy, right?

23:03.582 --> 23:04.850
Yes, that's right.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.918
It didn't help much,
as you can see.

23:06.985 --> 23:08.854
Do you know the name
of the therapist?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.922
No, I don't.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.492
But I know where his office is.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.094
I went with Alfredo there
a couple of times.

23:16.161 --> 23:18.196
It's in the building
where he jumped off.

23:19.097 --> 23:20.365
The same building?

23:21.466 --> 23:22.934
It was not on the file.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.837
I know that day
he had an appointment with him.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.339
Can I ask you something?

23:27.406 --> 23:30.675
How long will they take
to hand in the corpse to us?

23:30.742 --> 23:32.277
We want to bury him.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.079
You haven't got it yet?

23:34.146 --> 23:36.415
I have no idea
but I'll find out.

23:37.182 --> 23:40.385
Thanks a lot.
Talk to you later.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.157
Not only had he killed
nine people...

23:45.223 --> 23:47.426
and continued driving a train,
but he jumped off...

23:47.492 --> 23:49.461
the building
where he saw the therapist...

23:49.528 --> 23:52.063
paid by the company
twice a week.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.065
It's all very weird, right?

23:54.599 --> 23:56.968
Neglectful, rather.

23:57.035 --> 24:00.939
-What do you think?
-I'm not sure.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.341
But it doesn't seem to be
a coincidence to me.

24:03.675 --> 24:05.477
He chose
that place and that way...

24:05.544 --> 24:07.045
to kill himself for a reason.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.147
He wanted to make a point.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.052
-Shall I carry on?
-Yes.

24:17.355 --> 24:21.726
-Remember what I said.
-I will.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.710
-Good morning.
-How are you?

24:51.189 --> 24:52.757
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

24:57.062 --> 25:00.699
Excuse me, Mr. Longo.
I'm Verónica Rosenthal.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.535
-Did we have an appointment?
-No.

25:04.135 --> 25:07.105
I am reporter, I work
for "Nuestro Tiempo" magazine.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.707
I'd like to ask you
a few questions...

25:08.773 --> 25:11.910
about one of your patients.
Alfredo Carranza.

25:12.244 --> 25:15.780
I don't know
how I can be of any help.

25:16.214 --> 25:19.150
I'd like you to tell me
how he was doing.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.019
How long you'd been seeing him.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.320
When he was going
to be discharged.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.223
I can't tell you all that.

25:25.557 --> 25:26.658
That's between patient
and therapist.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.960
-I know, professional secrecy.
-Exactly.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.097
But Carranza killed himself.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.999
And it happened here,
in your building.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.401
I understand
you're doing your job.

25:36.735 --> 25:38.203
That's perfectly clear to me.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.573
But I refuse to talk to you
about my patients.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.309
Excuse me,
I must continue working.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.378
How was the match, kids?

28:34.279 --> 28:37.382
-We beat them six to four.
-Wonderful.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.384
Do you play for a club?

28:39.884 --> 28:41.252
-No.
-Why?

28:42.020 --> 28:44.389
Do you know Roca Juniors?
I work there.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.157
We are looking
for soccer players.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.094
-How old are you two?
-He's 12 and I'm 13.

28:49.427 --> 28:51.496
We are looking for a defender.
Just like you.

28:51.563 --> 28:55.033
A brave guy. Strong.
Skillful with the ball.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.269
-Would you like to take a test?
-What about him?

28:58.603 --> 29:00.271
Right now, we need a defender.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.807
But something may turn up
in the future.

29:03.141 --> 29:07.178
Here is the address.
The test is today.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.715
Here is some money
to buy some Coke.

29:14.652 --> 29:16.221
This isn't enough.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.094
-I'll be waiting for you.
-All right.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.070
-Will you go?
-I don't know.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.039
-Let's buy some coke.
-Some beer, rather.

29:35.373 --> 29:39.344
-No, I don't like beer.
-Me neither. Well, let's go.

30:11.342 --> 30:12.644
Hello?

30:13.511 --> 30:15.113
-Excuse me.
-Hello!

30:15.446 --> 30:18.950
I'm looking for Lucio Valrossa.
I was told he was here.

30:19.017 --> 30:21.286
-Who is looking for him?
-I'm Verónica Rosenthal.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.555
I work
for "Nuestro Tiempo" magazine.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.690
It's me.
What can I do for you?

30:25.757 --> 30:26.891
Nice to meet you, Lucio.

30:26.958 --> 30:29.828
Alfredo Carranza's sister
gave me your name.

30:29.894 --> 30:33.531
-I'm writing...
-Yes, come with me.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.323
Hop on.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.564
What do you want?

31:07.432 --> 31:11.436
-I'm here to talk about Alfredo.
-Look, miss.

31:11.502 --> 31:12.804
I don't know what the hell
you're doing here.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.038
But we don't want you here.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.574
Neither you
nor any other damn reporter.

31:16.641 --> 31:18.443
Alfredo killed himself
because he was weak.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.845
That's it. Period.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.948
Make a note of it and go away.

31:31.222 --> 31:35.460
I'm used to dealing
with punks like you.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.631
I fear no one.
Neither you not your boss.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.675
They told me
you were looking for me.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.912
Please, forgive him.

31:53.978 --> 31:56.781
He's just protecting his people.
He's lost his manners.

31:57.782 --> 32:00.351
I don't want anybody
to lose their job.

32:00.685 --> 32:03.354
I just want to know
what happened to Carranza.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.123
Why he killed himself
in that way.

32:05.556 --> 32:06.891
He is not the first one
who commits suicide.

32:06.958 --> 32:07.926
And he won't be the last.

32:08.493 --> 32:11.362
What do you want to know
exactly?

32:12.830 --> 32:16.801
We met on the terrace, right?
What were you doing there?

32:19.070 --> 32:22.507
Alfredo was my friend.
I felt the need to go...

32:22.573 --> 32:24.442
to the place
where he made the decision.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.178
What about you?

32:27.245 --> 32:28.646
I guess the same thing
happened to me.

32:28.713 --> 32:31.282
-Did you know him?
-No.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.351
Then it is not the same.

32:35.553 --> 32:36.988
Alfredo was in distress.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.557
He shouldn't have gotten
on that train.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.993
But he did, these are
the rules of the game.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.896
Not everyone gets up one day,
goes up to a rooftop...

32:44.963 --> 32:46.364
and blows his head off.

32:46.431 --> 32:47.632
No, not everyone.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.300
I think Alfredo
wanted to make a point.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.169
What?

32:51.235 --> 32:52.737
He used to see a shrink
in that building.

32:53.071 --> 32:54.472
Twice a week.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.208
The therapy was paid
by the company he worked for.

32:57.275 --> 33:00.845
The same you work for.
I think they expected...

33:00.912 --> 33:03.815
him to be discharged soon
so he'd get back to work.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.883
And they wouldn't have to pay
for idling time.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.786
Someone must be held
accountable for it, right?

33:10.088 --> 33:12.690
Could be. Alfredo wanted
to be discharged quickly.

33:13.858 --> 33:14.926
It's convenient
for the company...

33:14.993 --> 33:17.395
that we get back to work
and for us too.

33:18.963 --> 33:20.431
I have to go.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.369
He made a decision,
we have to respect it.

33:41.285 --> 33:43.221
I'm leaving, Vero.
Are you staying?

33:43.287 --> 33:45.189
-Just a little bit longer.
-Okay. Bye.

33:47.291 --> 33:52.196
Hi, Fede.
Can I ask you a favor?

33:54.265 --> 33:55.366
Yes, another one.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.469
I need you to find out
about a guy.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.304
Write down his name, please.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.774
Lucio Valrossa.
V and double S.

34:04.008 --> 34:06.010
I've been looking everywhere.
I can't find anything about him.

34:06.077 --> 34:07.412
He doesn't even have
a Facebook account.

34:07.478 --> 34:08.713
The only thing I know
is that he is a train driver.

34:09.914 --> 34:13.284
Anything you can find
would be appreciated. Thanks.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.963
Hello, missing girl.
Today is Benja's birthday.

34:26.030 --> 34:27.265
I guess you'll be coming.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.033
If you haven't bought
anything for him yet,

34:29.100 --> 34:32.637
get him a remote control
car racing track.

34:32.703 --> 34:35.573
You'll find the playground
address on Facebook.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.741
I'll wait for you.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.076
God!

34:48.519 --> 34:49.754
Can I have some?

34:53.324 --> 34:55.259
Come on!
I always share food with you.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.502
Where is Peque?

35:04.836 --> 35:06.237
He went to a sports club
to take a soccer test.

35:07.605 --> 35:08.906
That's great.
Which club?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.277
It's in Lugano.
Not a very good one.

35:16.013 --> 35:17.815
My father works
at a club in Lugano.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.317
He runs the cafeteria.

35:19.717 --> 35:21.519
Great! We can ask him
to give us something for free.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.190
I don't know where it is.
Why didn't you go?

35:28.192 --> 35:31.529
I didn't feel like it.
Besides, nobody knows that club.

35:31.596 --> 35:32.663
No way!

35:36.501 --> 35:38.302
We are going out
with Peque tonight.

35:38.369 --> 35:39.637
-Would you like to come?
-Where to?

35:40.938 --> 35:42.373
I'll tell you
just if you're coming.

35:43.941 --> 35:45.243
Maybe. I don't know.

35:46.410 --> 35:47.578
-Can I have some more?
-No.

35:47.912 --> 35:52.717
-Come on! Please!
-All right.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.022
I like the boy.
He seems to be brave.

35:58.689 --> 35:59.957
I told you.

36:00.024 --> 36:01.459
We still have to see
if he is really strong.

36:01.792 --> 36:04.662
Weak boys are no good for me.
Cholito, come here.

36:06.631 --> 36:07.899
See the new guy?

36:08.266 --> 36:10.535
Raise hell.
Let's see if he is strong.

36:17.808 --> 36:20.344
-Stop it, asshole.
-Let me go through.

36:20.678 --> 36:21.879
Get something for your girl.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.615
Stop it, you two.

36:24.949 --> 36:27.185
This is soccer.

36:27.251 --> 36:30.655
No crying here.
Go to the other end.

36:38.629 --> 36:41.232
-Vero?
-Come in. The door is open.

36:44.802 --> 36:48.206
-Would you like some coffee?
-No, thanks.

36:48.272 --> 36:50.508
I found something for you.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.277
-So quickly?
-That's right.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.279
Lucio Hernán Valrossa.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.781
Son and grandson
to railroad employees.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.217
Married to Mariana Goyena.
Two children.

36:59.584 --> 37:00.785
Let me help you with that.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.120
In 2005, his name appeared
on a defaulting borrower's list.

37:03.187 --> 37:06.490
Then he got straight.
He has a mortgage loan now.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.858
No criminal records.

37:07.925 --> 37:09.527
Although he was submitted
to an inquiry once.

37:09.860 --> 37:11.862
Due to an incident at a stadium.

37:12.196 --> 37:13.664
After a concert
of Los Redondos de Ricota's.

37:13.731 --> 37:17.468
Los Redonditos de Ricota.

37:17.535 --> 37:18.803
Or just "Los Redondos".

37:19.570 --> 37:22.006
Redonditos, that is right.

37:23.441 --> 37:26.110
Carranza's corpse was not
handed in to the family yet.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.079
-Do you know why?
-No, but I can ask the D.A.

37:31.282 --> 37:34.318
-It's ready.
-You're very talented.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.154
There was no need
for you to come here, Fede.

37:37.221 --> 37:40.424
You could've sent me
an email with the data.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.727
I could've.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.471
-Fine.
-Don't get mad.

37:53.537 --> 37:55.239
I won't.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.287
We are getting together
at César's house tonight...

38:09.353 --> 38:10.388
to watch the match.
Are you coming, Cholito?

38:10.454 --> 38:12.123
-I can't.
-Why?

38:12.857 --> 38:14.592
-I just can't.
-What's wrong with you?

38:15.259 --> 38:16.327
I'll take a test
at River Plate soccer club.

38:17.361 --> 38:18.562
That's bullshit.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.399
Shut up! A friend of my uncle's
is taking me.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.934
A soccer test at night?
That's not true.

38:24.001 --> 38:26.437
You never saw kids taking
a soccer test at night?

38:26.871 --> 38:28.339
Shut up if you don't know.

38:28.673 --> 38:31.909
-Does Rivero know?
-I don't care about him.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.146
-Are you a River fan?
-No, a Boca fan.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.382
Me too, but I would also play
in River if I had to.

38:38.749 --> 38:41.919
You need a lot of experience
to play in the major leagues.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.156
-You're just beginning.
-So what?

38:55.132 --> 38:56.167
Hello?

38:56.233 --> 38:57.368
Vero, it's me.

38:57.435 --> 38:58.402
I forgot to tell you
something important.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.605
The gun Carranza used
was under his name.

39:01.939 --> 39:04.141
I don't understand.
Under Carranza's name?

39:04.475 --> 39:06.811
No, under Valrossa's name.
The train driver.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.648
Was he questioned about that?

39:10.715 --> 39:11.816
Yes, of course.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.117
He said he hadn't given
Carranza the gun.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.120
He had no idea
how it'd gotten into his hands.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.688
As there were witnesses
of his death,

39:17.755 --> 39:19.056
that was the end of it.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.093
Fine.
Thanks, Fede.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.892
-What are you doing here?
-The gun was yours.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.728
I must be on my way.
Get off.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.263
I won't until you tell me
the truth.

40:34.231 --> 40:35.733
Move aside.
I have to depart. I'm late.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.573
Control room, I'm on my way.

40:57.254 --> 40:58.689
You'll choke yourself.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.530
I'm done.
Can I go out?

41:06.931 --> 41:08.065
I don't want you
to be in the street.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.500
I'll be up on the terrace.

41:10.434 --> 41:11.802
Okay, fine.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.224
-What is she doing here?
-She is coming.

41:34.258 --> 41:35.526
Let's go.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.001
How are we going to kill it?

41:44.735 --> 41:48.639
With this.
It has rat poison in it.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.639
Carranza killed himself
with your gun.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.441
Why didn't you tell me?

42:26.210 --> 42:27.478
You didn't ask.

42:27.811 --> 42:30.781
-You gave it to him?
-No.

42:31.148 --> 42:34.518
-He took it away from you.
-I don't know.

42:35.419 --> 42:36.954
Do you like guns?

42:38.556 --> 42:39.857
No, I don't.

42:40.658 --> 42:41.926
Why do you have one?

42:42.359 --> 42:44.028
That gun has always
been in my family.

42:44.094 --> 42:47.164
It belonged to my grandfather.
My father inherited it.

42:48.299 --> 42:49.633
I've never used it.

42:50.134 --> 42:51.669
If you didn't give it to him
and he didn't take...

42:51.735 --> 42:53.203
it away from you,
somebody else gave it to him.

42:53.270 --> 42:54.672
I told you, I don't know.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.975
Do you want me
to make up a story?

43:01.545 --> 43:02.780
Can I smoke here?

43:03.914 --> 43:05.382
You aren't supposed
to be here.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.586
Do it, if you want.

43:28.405 --> 43:30.574
Fine.
How do you know it's there?

43:34.078 --> 43:35.145
It's there.

43:35.913 --> 43:36.947
Who will throw it?

43:37.014 --> 43:38.949
-You do it.
-No, the three of us.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.118
We must be accomplices.
That is how it works.

43:41.485 --> 43:42.853
You start.

43:46.323 --> 43:49.526
Good.
He's eating. Now you.

43:53.263 --> 43:54.264
Ready.

43:56.066 --> 43:57.167
All right.

43:59.737 --> 44:02.640
Carranza's sister told me
the last accident was the worst.

44:03.841 --> 44:06.243
The kid.
He couldn't handle it.

44:06.610 --> 44:08.345
Kids are the worst.

44:10.347 --> 44:12.282
One thing is a suicide...

44:12.616 --> 44:14.618
or an older person
who can't hear the siren.

44:16.787 --> 44:18.555
And another one is a kid
with his headphones on.

44:18.889 --> 44:20.024
Completely unaware,
listening to music.

44:20.090 --> 44:22.092
By the time he realizes,
he got run over.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.494
That's terrible.

44:24.728 --> 44:26.697
-Did it happen to you?
-Not with kids.

44:29.733 --> 44:33.604
I had several accidents.
They are all awful.

44:34.905 --> 44:38.075
-What is it like?
-To hit someone?

44:42.746 --> 44:44.715
You feel the blow
here at the front.

44:44.782 --> 44:45.783
Like a shot.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.287
Then you hear the body burst.

44:51.755 --> 44:57.027
It sounds like shattered wood
when the bones break.

45:00.264 --> 45:03.233
Did you ever hear hail
falling on a tin roof?

45:04.968 --> 45:06.937
You feel that down here,
under your feet.

45:23.921 --> 45:25.322
Damn!

45:26.957 --> 45:29.860
Those bastards again!

45:40.137 --> 45:41.505
Damn!

45:43.407 --> 45:44.708
They got away.

46:43.167 --> 46:44.334
I'm sorry.

46:47.538 --> 46:48.939
No problem.

46:52.910 --> 46:53.443
ON THE NEXT EPISODE...
