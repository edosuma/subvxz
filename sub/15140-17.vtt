00:00.125 --> 00:01.994
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.061 --> 00:04.496
You want to be president
because you want the power

00:04.563 --> 00:06.465
- to control the universe.
- That's not me.

00:06.532 --> 00:09.068
- That's the problem.
- [man] Get the doctor in here.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.270
[Kelly] Isn't Templeton next in line?

00:11.337 --> 00:15.541
I will faithfully execute the office
of president of the United States.

00:15.608 --> 00:16.875
Hello, Mr. President.

00:16.942 --> 00:20.813
You used this office
for your massive ego.

00:20.879 --> 00:22.448
What I did, I did for this country.

00:22.514 --> 00:25.818
You couldn't make a decision
from this office. I could, and I did.

00:25.884 --> 00:27.653
You have crossed a line with me.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.122
Get the hell out of my office.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.965
[whirring]

00:50.709 --> 00:52.711
You're on my treadmill.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.083
Only one where you can see
C-SPAN, the news and ESPN.

00:58.150 --> 01:00.419
I'm here every morning
at precisely 5:00 a.m.

01:00.486 --> 01:02.488
It's ten after.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.195
Pegged you as more of
a "roll out of a hangover

01:10.262 --> 01:12.398
and straight into the office"
kind of guy.

01:12.464 --> 01:14.967
Yeah, I just joined.
New Year's resolution.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.835
[chuckles] It's May.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.004
It didn't take the first few times.

01:20.072 --> 01:21.073
Who won?

01:21.140 --> 01:23.575
Well, you could make a case
for the president.

01:23.642 --> 01:27.146
She goes from the ICU to Indonesia
without missing a beat.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.815
Throw in Manila and Bangkok
for good measure,

01:29.882 --> 01:31.583
might as well call her
Wonder Woman.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.819
But if you ask me,
your guy's the real winner.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.188
Twenty-four-hour presidency,
ends the strike,

01:36.255 --> 01:38.524
elevates himself
to a whole new stratosphere.

01:38.590 --> 01:40.492
You've got your first campaign spots.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.728
I meant the Phillies game.

01:47.266 --> 01:49.968
Well, definitely
the women's conference in Manila

01:50.035 --> 01:51.737
was the high point of the trip.

01:51.804 --> 01:55.874
8,500 women
from all points of the globe.

01:55.941 --> 01:58.677
- Kenya, Mongolia.
- Not to mention Washington.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.046
The presence
of the first woman U.S. president

02:01.113 --> 02:02.948
had its impact on the delegates.

02:03.015 --> 02:04.850
So many amazing women.

02:04.917 --> 02:08.920
We Americans fancy ourselves
pioneers, but many other countries...

02:08.987 --> 02:10.255
- [knock on door]
- Come in.

02:10.322 --> 02:13.258
...have had female heads of state.
The Philippines...

02:13.325 --> 02:15.227
We're on our second female president.

02:15.294 --> 02:17.129
The special blend I told you about.

02:17.196 --> 02:20.399
Wheat germ, soy,
ginkgo extract and salmon oil.

02:20.466 --> 02:21.533
Salmon oil?

02:21.600 --> 02:24.370
Old Air Force trick.
Sure-fire cure for jet lag.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.773
Thanks. Well, uh,
I'll have that... later.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.543
[laughs] Let's jump on
to another topic.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.346
When Speaker Templeton
took over your office for a day,

02:34.413 --> 02:37.916
he got an injunction against
the pilot's union to stop the strike.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.119
Was that a rebuke
to your leadership?

02:40.185 --> 02:43.555
I'm not going to waste a minute
wondering about the speaker's motives.

02:43.622 --> 02:46.191
I'm just gonna clean up the mess
he left behind.

02:46.258 --> 02:48.627
Fortunately for us,
I recovered quickly.

02:48.694 --> 02:50.462
This trip certainly speaks to that.

02:50.529 --> 02:53.565
I should let you get some sleep.
How long have you been up now?

02:53.632 --> 02:56.635
Twenty-seven and a half hours.
But who's counting?

02:56.702 --> 02:59.171
- [chuckles] Enjoy your rest, ma'am.
- Thank you.

03:05.778 --> 03:08.714
[man] Come on. Kelly,
I have hard facts to confirm it.

03:08.781 --> 03:10.916
- [woman] That's right.
- [man 2] It's true.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.518
[Kelly] it's just not accurate.

03:12.584 --> 03:14.787
[man] Are you questioning
our notes, Kelly?

03:14.853 --> 03:17.322
The last White House reporter
this sloppy with facts

03:17.389 --> 03:19.792
now covers school board
meetings in Loudon County.

03:19.858 --> 03:21.660
We gotta get an impartial ruling.

03:21.727 --> 03:23.162
- Turbulence counts.
- What?

03:23.228 --> 03:24.229
Thank you, Jimmy.

03:24.296 --> 03:26.932
The whole flight from Jakarta
to Sydney was bumpy.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.802
Yes, and because turbulence
is random, it is constant.

03:29.868 --> 03:32.671
[laughing]
Zen and the art of air bowling.

03:32.738 --> 03:34.740
[Charlie] All right.
Oliver's still up.

03:34.807 --> 03:36.875
It's gonna take a strike, Kelly.

03:36.942 --> 03:38.544
It comes down to this:

03:38.610 --> 03:42.548
One woman, one orange, ten cans.

03:44.216 --> 03:45.717
- Unbelievable!
- Whoo!

03:47.352 --> 03:51.123
Sounds like Kelly just picked up
another seven-ten split.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.058
The beast never sleeps.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.893
[sighing]

03:54.960 --> 03:57.830
You catch the president's head bob
during the last bilat?

03:57.896 --> 04:00.699
How could you miss it?
Even made the Secret Service flinch.

04:00.766 --> 04:03.869
Hmm. At least we're done for today,

04:03.936 --> 04:06.638
except for the, uh, veep tryouts.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.240
The president's exhausted.

04:08.307 --> 04:10.709
I'm not even sure
she remembers it's her birthday.

04:10.776 --> 04:13.011
She knows, trust me.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.546
A couple of years ago,

04:14.613 --> 04:17.048
I stuck a candle in a cupcake.
Mm-mmm.

04:17.115 --> 04:18.817
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardner,

04:18.884 --> 04:21.920
a secure call from the White House
Situation Room. Mr. Prado.

04:21.987 --> 04:23.322
Thanks, colonel.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.125
Tony.

04:28.794 --> 04:30.796
You're sure?

04:31.797 --> 04:34.333
OK. We'll wake her.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.202
Vince, you need to...

04:38.303 --> 04:39.304
Vince.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.612
This is Mr. Gardner.
Please ring the president's cabin.

04:47.946 --> 04:49.615
[Rebecca] Because they're ahead.

04:49.681 --> 04:53.118
I don't understand. We called Mom
yesterday to wish her a happy birthday.

04:53.185 --> 04:54.186
Yeah, and...?

04:54.253 --> 04:56.221
But today,
it's her birthday again? How?

04:56.288 --> 04:58.423
International Date Line.
Rebecca's right.

04:58.490 --> 05:00.259
- Ha!
- Good morning, kids.

05:00.325 --> 05:01.627
[kids] 'Morning, Grandma.

05:01.693 --> 05:03.262
OK, it's like this.

05:03.328 --> 05:06.064
The plane carrying Mom
left Indonesia at midnight.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.133
Midnight last night
or midnight tonight?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.669
How could it be midnight?
Tonight hasn't happened.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.439
Grandma, can you help me
with my shoelaces?

05:14.506 --> 05:16.308
Of course, bunny.
Hop right up.

05:16.375 --> 05:17.476
Now remember,

05:17.543 --> 05:20.445
we are all going out for dinner
tonight. You got it?

05:20.512 --> 05:22.447
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

05:22.514 --> 05:26.451
Oh, Nora said just drop off the gifts,
she'll take care of wrapping 'em.

05:29.721 --> 05:31.790
You guys did get
your mother gifts, right?

05:31.857 --> 05:34.660
It's kind of hard to compete
with the king of Jordan.

05:34.726 --> 05:38.096
- That's not the point, Horace.
- We get mobbed when we go to the mall.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.966
After school, I'll take you to the mall.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.001
Nobody's gonna mess with me.

05:43.068 --> 05:45.437
- [Horace] Fine.
- [Rebecca] OK.

05:45.504 --> 05:47.506
Air Force One is faster
than other planes.

05:47.573 --> 05:49.241
Nice try.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.683
Jim, you obviously didn't see

05:57.749 --> 05:59.818
the "do not disturb" sign
I left on my door.

06:00.786 --> 06:03.021
- Is Anthony on the line?
- Standing by.

06:03.555 --> 06:05.891
- Anthony.
- My apologies, Madam President.

06:05.958 --> 06:07.025
What have you got?

06:07.092 --> 06:09.628
A little over an hour ago,
just after first prayer,

06:09.695 --> 06:11.296
an unidentified militant group

06:11.363 --> 06:13.966
- stormed the Woodley Hotel in Istanbul.
- How many?

06:14.032 --> 06:16.535
- Uh, militants?
- Americans.

06:16.602 --> 06:18.503
They are there?
That is why you woke me?

06:18.570 --> 06:21.473
- Twenty-two Americans.
- [sighs] What do we know about them?

06:21.540 --> 06:24.977
Nineteen are medical personnel.
Twelve men, seven women.

06:25.043 --> 06:28.981
- Part of the State Department team...
- In Kustepe, the hospital project.

06:29.047 --> 06:31.650
They were to leave
on a charter flight this afternoon.

06:31.717 --> 06:34.152
There could be as many
as 300 people in the hotel.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.456
Nineteen were with the hospital project.
Who are the other three?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.791
A husband and wife from Toledo.

06:39.858 --> 06:43.061
They were visiting their family
with their 16-year-old daughter.

06:43.128 --> 06:46.531
- What else?
- The Turkish military is moving fast,

06:46.598 --> 06:48.900
threatening to storm
the hotel within the hour.

06:48.967 --> 06:51.370
Call the prime minister,
tell him to slow this down.

06:51.436 --> 06:53.739
I'm not sure he's in control
of his own military.

06:53.805 --> 06:57.909
Tony, I'm 35,000 feet over nowhere.
Keep the troops out of the hotel.

06:57.976 --> 06:59.011
Yes, ma'am.

06:59.077 --> 07:00.812
And, uh, ma'am...

07:00.879 --> 07:02.214
...happy birthday.

07:27.105 --> 07:28.707
Tony, what do we know?

07:28.774 --> 07:30.876
The KSM has claimed responsibility.

07:30.942 --> 07:32.711
- Kurdish separatists?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:32.778 --> 07:35.013
- What do they want?
- Besides their own country?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.849
No specific demands.
Could be any number of things.

07:37.916 --> 07:41.520
Elections are coming up. They may be
trying to embarrass the prime minister.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.390
Get Harry and Tuba here from Langley,
make sure this isn't something bigger.

07:45.457 --> 07:48.326
- They're already here.
- Do we trust Prime Minister Levitas?

07:48.393 --> 07:50.829
He made a speech last week
at the Madrid conference

07:50.896 --> 07:53.532
that was pretty inflammatory,
very anti-West.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.268
- For the moment, we have no choice.
- Madam President.

07:56.334 --> 07:58.470
Vince, would you get Levitas
on the phone?

07:58.537 --> 07:59.538
Yes, ma'am.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.973
Ma'am, should we reschedule
the VP interviews?

08:02.040 --> 08:04.843
No. I'm not letting this presidency
be hijacked again.

08:04.910 --> 08:08.380
The thought of Templeton spending
one more second behind my desk...

08:08.447 --> 08:11.016
- Yeah.
- [Vince] Right this way, please. Ma'am.

08:12.818 --> 08:15.887
Harry, can't you dress more like Tuba?

08:15.954 --> 08:18.423
The agency frowns
on that sort of thing, ma'am.

08:20.092 --> 08:22.160
Please. Thank you.

08:23.095 --> 08:25.630
So do you think this is related
to your listening post?

08:25.697 --> 08:28.100
Could be. Either way,
we need to tread lightly.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.102
We can't anger Prime Minister Levitas

08:30.168 --> 08:32.837
- before construction begins.
- Levitas won't back out.

08:32.904 --> 08:35.774
The Turks want to eavesdrop
on Iran just as much as we do.

08:35.841 --> 08:38.909
It's in everyone's best interest
to keep nuclear weapons out.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.446
- I'm not so sure he didn't engineer it.
- Who?

08:41.513 --> 08:42.780
The prime minister.

08:42.847 --> 08:44.216
OK. Here we go.

08:44.282 --> 08:46.284
If the prime minister
has second thoughts,

08:46.351 --> 08:48.620
he just takes
that hotel hostage for a few hours.

08:48.687 --> 08:51.356
And risk getting some
of his own men killed.

08:51.423 --> 08:53.558
You gotta break a few eggs
to make an omelet.

08:54.126 --> 08:57.596
[Mac] Harry, you probably believe
that Neil Armstrong's moon landing

08:57.662 --> 08:59.765
was created on a soundstage
in Hollywood.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.933
Ah, no, ma'am. It was Burbank.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.871
Our first priority has to be saving
the lives of those 22 Americans.

09:05.937 --> 09:08.306
The listening post will live
to fight another day.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.976
Jim, this post is vital
to security around the region.

09:11.042 --> 09:13.545
Around the globe.
The ability to monitor

09:13.612 --> 09:16.882
potentially the most dangerous
rogue nation in the world.

09:16.948 --> 09:18.483
Prime minister's on the line.

09:20.752 --> 09:24.289
Ma'am, the Turkish prime minister
is sort of a nut, but he's a useful nut.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.992
It would be very good if you could,
uh, keep him that way.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.296
Mr. Prime Minister,
this is President Allen.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.933
I want to thank you for your restraint.
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.402
[Levitas] With respect,
this is not your problem.

09:37.469 --> 09:39.971
Helping the people of Kustepe
get medical attention

09:40.038 --> 09:42.307
- was not our problem either.
- This is different.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.409
Men with guns hold
one of my hotels hostage.

09:44.476 --> 09:46.711
There are 22 Americans inside.

09:46.778 --> 09:50.081
I'm just asking for some more time
so we know what we're dealing with.

09:50.148 --> 09:52.050
And I cannot afford to wait.

09:52.117 --> 09:56.188
At least let us get our military
in place so we can get our citizens out.

09:56.254 --> 09:59.524
American military presence
will only escalate the situation.

09:59.591 --> 10:03.228
- As will storming the hotel.
- Perhaps. But...

10:03.295 --> 10:05.397
Mr. Prime Minister,
may I call you back?

10:05.463 --> 10:06.865
- Of course.
- [beeps]

10:06.932 --> 10:10.168
The wires are reporting that hostages
are leaving the Woodley Hotel.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.337
They released them?
That doesn't make sense.

10:12.404 --> 10:16.541
Oh, it does if the whole thing
was, uh, staged like a stunt.

10:16.608 --> 10:17.943
Or they escaped.

10:18.009 --> 10:20.545
We spend $40 billion a year
on intelligence,

10:20.612 --> 10:23.782
and I'm getting my information
from the media. Get me some answers.

10:23.849 --> 10:25.550
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.154
Ma'am, Governor Solis
is waiting in the Cabinet Room.

10:29.688 --> 10:31.022
He can wait.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.825
For what? The world to stop
exploding around us?

10:33.892 --> 10:36.928
- Good luck.
- And Dickie is hovering as well.

10:36.995 --> 10:40.799
Dickie, Averell Harriman used to say,
when the president turns to you,

10:40.866 --> 10:43.568
you have seven seconds
to make your case.

10:43.635 --> 10:45.470
- Go.
- We need to get this right, ma'am.

10:45.537 --> 10:47.772
You last chose a vice president
with your heart.

10:47.839 --> 10:51.176
- Keaton was extremely qualified.
- Solis is young, vibrant, Hispanic,

10:51.243 --> 10:53.411
the governor of Texas,
if it were its own state,

10:53.478 --> 10:55.447
the eighth-largest economy in the world.

10:55.513 --> 10:57.716
He could put 34 electoral votes
in our column.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.218
He has a wife who's a professor,
three young kids.

11:00.285 --> 11:03.321
So you like him? Another cup
of coffee won't get you fired.

11:04.656 --> 11:06.658
And by the way, that was 17 seconds.

11:16.201 --> 11:19.738
Hey, Mr. President. Great job.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.473
Thank you. Hey, kids.

11:21.539 --> 11:24.042
- [girl] Hi, Mr. President.
- [boy] Hi.

11:26.678 --> 11:29.047
Jayne thinks he's
the best political consultant

11:29.114 --> 11:30.949
working on our side of the fence.

11:31.883 --> 11:33.685
But I'm... I'm not so sure about him.

11:33.752 --> 11:36.288
Well, Jayne likes him, doesn't she?

11:36.354 --> 11:37.689
Yeah.

11:37.756 --> 11:40.825
And he's proven quite useful,
hasn't he?

11:40.892 --> 11:43.895
Yeah, at digging.
But digging is not directing.

11:43.962 --> 11:46.498
And I don't want to be handled anyway.

11:46.564 --> 11:48.500
I mean, we don't want this campaign

11:48.566 --> 11:51.670
to be about consultants
and focus groups.

11:51.736 --> 11:54.806
This has to be about me,
and I know what I know.

11:54.873 --> 11:58.343
Bloody hell, I've got ties
in my closet older than this kid.

11:59.577 --> 12:02.314
Hey, thanks for ending
the airline strike, Mr. President.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.182
Just doing my job. Thank you.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.518
Remember when you first ran,

12:06.584 --> 12:09.821
all those hours we went
door to door, meeting people?

12:09.888 --> 12:12.357
[sighs] Times have changed.

12:12.424 --> 12:14.426
It's a big country, Nate.

12:14.492 --> 12:16.494
Yeah. [chuckles]

12:16.561 --> 12:19.064
You telling me I'm not gonna get
to the White House

12:19.130 --> 12:23.201
by going door to door
and visiting courthouses?

12:24.602 --> 12:26.938
You mean back to the White House.

12:27.005 --> 12:28.673
[chuckling]

12:30.141 --> 12:32.277
Back to the White House.

12:33.411 --> 12:36.081
[Lance] Mr. Speaker, I'm a guy
who makes a bunch of money

12:36.147 --> 12:38.750
reminding politicians
of their deeply held beliefs,

12:38.817 --> 12:41.619
which means I would imagine
that I represent

12:41.686 --> 12:44.255
everything that you hate
about modern politics.

12:45.156 --> 12:49.494
Well, I'm contemplating hiring you,
Mr. Addison, not marrying you.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.996
[chuckles] Mr. Speaker,

12:51.062 --> 12:53.531
I've elected 18 United States senators,

12:53.598 --> 12:56.935
14 governors, more congressmen
than I can remember,

12:57.002 --> 13:00.071
but I have never elected
the president of the United States.

13:00.138 --> 13:01.906
I want to change that, Mr. Speaker.

13:02.707 --> 13:04.042
And you're the man.

13:07.112 --> 13:10.448
You know, I've sat here
listening to you guys,

13:11.116 --> 13:12.851
and I know...
I know she's a woman,

13:12.917 --> 13:17.756
I know she's an unelected president
without a geographic base.

13:17.822 --> 13:20.392
She has no party structure
behind her.

13:22.327 --> 13:23.328
But...

13:23.395 --> 13:25.797
But she has the most powerful
forces on the planet

13:25.864 --> 13:29.334
to help her get through this process...
the Oval Office, Air Force One.

13:29.401 --> 13:32.404
And, yes, she's a woman, but
she is still the commander in chief,

13:32.470 --> 13:36.908
and when she walks into a room,
they still play Hail to the Chief.

13:36.975 --> 13:38.777
But in a three-way race,

13:38.843 --> 13:43.348
it will be almost impossible
for anyone to get 271 electoral votes.

13:43.415 --> 13:46.384
That throws the election
to the House of Representatives,

13:46.451 --> 13:48.953
and, uh, he's got
some very good friends there.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.956
Mm. Ma'am... no.

13:52.757 --> 13:55.360
There is no way the House
can overturn the popular vote.

13:55.427 --> 13:56.961
If his pals in Congress try that,

13:57.028 --> 13:59.631
they're going to be
run out of office on a rail.

13:59.697 --> 14:03.334
You have to win this outright,
which means our goal,

14:03.401 --> 14:05.804
our mission,

14:05.870 --> 14:08.807
is to destroy Mackenzie Allen
as a viable political choice.

14:08.873 --> 14:11.309
Not hurt her, not ding her...

14:11.976 --> 14:13.111
...destroy her.

14:14.245 --> 14:15.847
It's the only way we can win.

14:18.850 --> 14:20.652
I could ask you
the same question.

14:20.718 --> 14:23.054
Did you feel you had
the foreign policy experience

14:23.121 --> 14:26.257
- when you joined the Bridges ticket?
- I respect your honesty.

14:26.324 --> 14:30.128
Thank you, ma'am. Governor's mansion
in Austin has lots of fancy rooms,

14:30.195 --> 14:33.164
nothing quite like the White House
Situation Room. But I'm...

14:33.231 --> 14:34.666
Oh, excuse me.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.735
Governor, I'm afraid
I need to cut this short.

14:37.802 --> 14:38.803
I understand.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.339
My staff thinks very highly of you,
and I can see why.

14:41.406 --> 14:42.740
Thank you.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.175
[Mac] Are we sure?

14:44.242 --> 14:46.845
State Department spoke to our consulate.

14:46.911 --> 14:48.746
They let everyone go
but the Americans?

14:48.813 --> 14:50.315
Yes, ma'am.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.818
- [man] Ten-hut!
- Jim.

14:53.885 --> 14:56.521
One of the released hostages,
a German businessman,

14:56.588 --> 14:59.157
said the Americans had been
moved to the second floor.

14:59.224 --> 15:01.226
Turkish police are doing a full debrief.

15:01.292 --> 15:05.163
We know that there are as many
as ten terrorists inside the building.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.698
They're all heavily armed.

15:06.764 --> 15:09.634
We believe that they're also
all wired with high explosives.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.303
What are our chances
of getting the hostages out?

15:12.370 --> 15:16.307
Ma'am, we are mobilizing
a Delta Force team out of Italy,

15:16.374 --> 15:18.676
but we're gonna need some time

15:18.743 --> 15:20.979
to formulate the appropriate
rescue mission.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.147
Turn... turn that up.

15:22.213 --> 15:25.984
We are awaiting what we are told
will be a statement from the terrorists.

15:26.918 --> 15:28.253
Hang on.

15:30.255 --> 15:32.824
I am not exactly sure
what is happening.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.026
Perhaps a deal has been struck.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.130
- The front door to the hotel is open.
- Go, go!

15:41.199 --> 15:42.700
- [gun fires]
- [woman] Dear God.

15:47.138 --> 15:48.506
We apologize to our viewers

15:48.573 --> 15:51.576
who have just witnessed
this tragic turn of events.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.614
[man] The Turkish government

15:56.681 --> 16:01.152
continues to unjustly imprison
67 of our Kurdish brothers.

16:01.219 --> 16:04.355
These are honorable men
whose only crime

16:04.422 --> 16:06.758
is that they believe
the Kurdish people

16:06.824 --> 16:08.960
deserve to have their own land,

16:09.027 --> 16:11.029
speak their own language

16:11.095 --> 16:13.031
and to honor their own culture...

16:13.097 --> 16:17.335
Madam President, we've got snipers
in position. We can take this guy out.

16:18.836 --> 16:21.239
We will kill an American
every two hours

16:21.306 --> 16:25.610
until the Turkish government
releases all our countrymen.

16:25.677 --> 16:27.312
It's on your order, ma'am.

16:28.346 --> 16:30.715
We kill this guy, we don't know
what happens next.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.217
I can't risk the hostages.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.451
Two hours,

16:33.518 --> 16:36.621
and then we kill David Nelson.

16:38.189 --> 16:41.526
General Allyson, tell me we have
our Delta Force team in place

16:41.593 --> 16:42.961
and ready to take this hotel.

16:43.027 --> 16:45.196
Ma'am, we're working
as fast as we can here.

16:45.263 --> 16:48.399
General, an American
was just executed on live TV.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.735
I'm gonna walk back in this room
in 20 minutes,

16:50.802 --> 16:53.104
- and you'll have a plan for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:54.072 --> 16:55.406
[Mac] Jim.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.144
- Where is David Nelson from?
- Idaho.

17:00.211 --> 17:02.247
Get on the phone
with Governor Jenkins.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.816
I want somebody representing
this administration

17:04.882 --> 17:06.784
at the Nelson house
within ten minutes.

17:06.851 --> 17:10.320
And find out the name of our murdered
American. I want to call his family.

17:10.387 --> 17:11.388
Yes, ma'am.

17:15.292 --> 17:18.630
Oh, we could buy Mom an early
edition of The Sun Also Rises.

17:18.695 --> 17:21.199
- She loves Hemingway.
- I don't get that book.

17:21.266 --> 17:23.534
That's because
you only read the Cliff Notes.

17:25.236 --> 17:26.971
OK. [sighs]

17:27.872 --> 17:29.274
What about Doctor Zhivago?

17:29.340 --> 17:31.009
They made that into a book?

17:31.909 --> 17:33.011
Kidding.

17:34.846 --> 17:38.049
Grandma, you do realize we have
a library in the White House?

17:38.116 --> 17:41.819
That's what that big room
with all the books is.

17:41.886 --> 17:42.987
[Rebecca laughs]

17:43.054 --> 17:46.924
Do you remember the old blue swing
that I had on my front porch?

17:46.991 --> 17:49.260
Yeah. I still have the scar
behind my left ear

17:49.327 --> 17:51.863
when Horace tried to slingshot me
into the front yard.

17:51.929 --> 17:54.132
It would've worked
if the chain didn't break.

17:54.198 --> 17:57.168
You guys were very little,
probably too little to remember,

17:57.235 --> 18:01.506
but your mom used to sit
on that swing for hours.

18:02.340 --> 18:04.075
And she would read you books.

18:04.142 --> 18:07.945
And when she ran out of books,
she would make up stories.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.682
She called it "twin time."

18:11.215 --> 18:12.850
I think I actually remember that.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.452
- Yeah?
- Me too.

18:14.519 --> 18:16.254
Well, good.

18:16.321 --> 18:20.391
Maybe your mom would like
to be reminded of that time as well.

18:27.432 --> 18:30.034
I always pegged you
as more of a gatherer, Vince.

18:30.101 --> 18:32.970
From the Chinese premier.
Nineteenth century.

18:33.037 --> 18:35.506
I guess he didn't get the memo.
Female president.

18:35.573 --> 18:38.810
I don't know. I'm betting this president
can handle a bow and arrow.

18:38.876 --> 18:40.144
No doubt. How's she doing?

18:40.211 --> 18:42.714
I mean, she hasn't had
the best birthday on record.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.782
She's fine.
Uh, the next VP candidate?

18:44.849 --> 18:46.818
He's waiting for you
in the Cabinet Room.

18:46.884 --> 18:49.020
Oh, can you tell her
the speaker called?

18:49.087 --> 18:51.255
- Tough day. It might be a while.
- Mmm.

18:55.126 --> 18:56.928
- Senator.
- Jim.

18:56.994 --> 18:59.097
My apologies.
The president is delayed.

18:59.163 --> 19:02.233
The situation in Turkey?
How's the president holding up?

19:02.300 --> 19:04.902
- In complete control.
- Good, good.

19:05.737 --> 19:06.904
We can reschedule.

19:08.673 --> 19:12.110
You tell me, Jim,
wasn't it just two years ago,

19:12.176 --> 19:13.911
same meeting with Bridges?

19:13.978 --> 19:15.413
Gonna be the same results?

19:15.480 --> 19:18.282
You wouldn't be on her short list
if it wasn't for real.

19:18.349 --> 19:20.585
- She doesn't play games.
- I'm sure she doesn't.

19:20.651 --> 19:24.288
There's only so much social advancement
the country'll accept at one time.

19:24.355 --> 19:26.758
Is that what you tell
your kids at night?

19:27.492 --> 19:30.027
- You deserve to be here.
- I don't mean to be cynical...

19:30.094 --> 19:31.996
Then don't be. This is real.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.437
Then please tell the president
that I appreciate her interest,

19:39.504 --> 19:42.540
and I'll gladly reschedule
at her convenience.

19:47.712 --> 19:51.048
[Mac] What do we know about
the Kurdish political prisoners, Tuba?

19:51.115 --> 19:54.786
Political scientists,
journalists, authors...

19:54.852 --> 19:57.855
Some would be tenured professors
if they lived in this country.

19:57.922 --> 20:00.792
That's what you get when it's
against the law to insult the state.

20:00.858 --> 20:02.160
Where does that leave us?

20:02.226 --> 20:06.731
We have been providing military
and economic aid in Turkey for years.

20:06.798 --> 20:10.468
Maybe it's time we called in a chit, see
how many of these political prisoners

20:10.535 --> 20:12.703
we can get released
in exchange for Americans.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.405
We wouldn't be negotiating.

20:14.472 --> 20:16.808
- The Turkish government would be.
- Win-win.

20:16.874 --> 20:19.010
Whatever we do,
we need to stall for time.

20:20.278 --> 20:23.147
- Vince!
- Madam President.

20:23.214 --> 20:26.217
- Get the prime minister on the phone.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:26.284 --> 20:29.554
You know, one thing always did
bother me about the moon landing.

20:30.555 --> 20:32.223
The video of the flag fluttering.

20:32.290 --> 20:35.159
Everybody knows
there's no wind on the moon.

20:35.226 --> 20:37.228
- Line two, ma'am.
- [beeps]

20:37.295 --> 20:40.331
Mr. Prime Minister,
would you be willing...

20:40.398 --> 20:43.034
And I'm not saying
we're ready to ask,

20:43.100 --> 20:46.504
but would you be willing
to release a limited number

20:46.571 --> 20:48.105
of your political prisoners?

20:48.172 --> 20:52.510
[Levitas] Madam President, are you
asking me to negotiate with terrorists?

20:52.577 --> 20:54.712
I'm not asking you yet,
Mr. Prime Minister.

20:54.779 --> 20:56.047
Of course you're not.

20:56.113 --> 20:58.783
But if you did, I would tell you
that I am willing to do it,

20:58.850 --> 21:00.852
to release my prisoners.

21:01.819 --> 21:03.321
- You are?
- Yes, ma'am.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.123
But I would have to tell the world
that I let my prisoners go

21:06.190 --> 21:08.526
at the request
of the American president.

21:10.995 --> 21:13.264
I will consider your offer.

21:13.331 --> 21:14.332
Thank you.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.467
[phone beeps]

21:18.469 --> 21:19.470
[Anthony] Ma'am?

21:19.537 --> 21:21.606
It's been 15 minutes.
That's long enough.

21:23.941 --> 21:25.610
General, you're on.

21:25.676 --> 21:28.880
This is a representation
of the Woodley Hotel.

21:28.946 --> 21:31.282
The hotel was built
on the original foundations

21:31.349 --> 21:33.684
of the sultan's summer palace.
General.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.889
This blue line represents a passageway
from the palace to the Bosporus,

21:37.955 --> 21:41.425
where the sultan would board his boat.
The Bosporus was much lower then.

21:41.492 --> 21:43.694
So now it's a secret tunnel
hidden by water.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.430
We can launch an amphibious landing
and not come up for air

21:46.497 --> 21:48.432
until we're in the basement
of the hotel.

21:48.499 --> 21:50.635
How many men will it take
to get into the hotel

21:50.701 --> 21:53.237
- and overwhelm the terrorists?
- That's the problem.

21:53.304 --> 21:56.274
There's a low fog ceiling out of Aviano.
I don't have a full team.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.543
- How many men are ready to go in?
- I've got nine,

21:58.609 --> 22:00.278
but it might be an hour, maybe two,

22:00.344 --> 22:03.047
until the fog lifts and I can get
the whole team in place.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.950
- I need three more men.
- David Nelson doesn't have two hours.

22:06.017 --> 22:08.152
If I may, Delta Team
is specifically trained

22:08.219 --> 22:09.687
to operate as a complete unit.

22:09.754 --> 22:11.822
At full force,
it's virtually unstoppable.

22:11.889 --> 22:14.725
- And at three-quarters strength?
- It's like having a table

22:14.792 --> 22:16.994
that has three legs under it
instead of four.

22:17.061 --> 22:19.063
It'll work, just not as well.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.632
Are you telling me
that I should let one man die

22:21.699 --> 22:24.602
so we can try and save
the rest of the hostages?

22:24.669 --> 22:26.737
No, ma'am.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.472
That's your decision.

22:32.877 --> 22:35.913
In 94 minutes,
they kill another American.

22:35.980 --> 22:40.284
What are the odds of success
if we go in now without a full team?

22:40.351 --> 22:42.353
It depends on your definition
of success.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.622
Our calculus is running
around 60/20.

22:44.689 --> 22:46.857
What that means is 60 percent chance

22:46.924 --> 22:49.760
of taking 20 percent casualties or less.

22:49.827 --> 22:53.164
With a full team, that moves to 70/15.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.768
I'm not gonna sit here and allow
another American to be executed.

22:58.235 --> 22:59.704
Move the team in place now.

22:59.770 --> 23:02.707
I wanna know the second
they're in position to enter the hotel.

23:02.773 --> 23:04.775
The final go order
is mine and mine alone.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.111
- Understood.
- How long until we have updates?

23:07.178 --> 23:09.246
They should be in position
in under an hour.

23:09.313 --> 23:11.849
We'll be able to communicate
when they're inside.

23:11.916 --> 23:13.684
We're up against the next deadline.

23:13.751 --> 23:16.053
Tell the prime minister
he has my authorization

23:16.120 --> 23:19.590
to start negotiations for the hostages.
Maybe that'll buy us some time.

23:19.657 --> 23:21.292
Just to be clear, Madam President,

23:21.359 --> 23:24.729
the Turks are likely to let it be known
you ordered them to negotiate.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.733
Well, there's not much to be done
until they're in place.

23:28.799 --> 23:31.035
You might want to try
and get some rest.

23:32.803 --> 23:35.406
Do we know his name?
The man they shot.

23:36.941 --> 23:38.643
Richard Hopkins.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.444
Richard Hopkins.

23:47.585 --> 23:49.654
[Allyson] Ma'am.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.723
We will kill that son of a bitch
that shot that American.

23:52.790 --> 23:54.225
I promise you that.

23:55.826 --> 23:56.927
Good.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.064
Boss.

24:00.831 --> 24:04.568
The entire press pool is calling you
to comment on the Turkish crisis.

24:04.635 --> 24:08.272
The Turks leaked that they've been
asked to negotiate by President Allen.

24:08.339 --> 24:09.674
Oh, she didn't.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.243
Well, that's her instinct.

24:12.309 --> 24:14.912
Things will work out
if we can just talk.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.049
Maybe I should touch base
with Jim Gardner.

24:18.115 --> 24:20.117
Lance is right, you know?

24:20.184 --> 24:21.986
Lance may be necessary,

24:22.053 --> 24:24.455
but you mustn't confuse
necessary with right.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.959
- Ow.
- Sorry.

24:29.026 --> 24:31.195
Nora said she would
do this for you, you know?

24:31.262 --> 24:33.631
And have her judge my taste
in books? No, thank you.

24:33.698 --> 24:35.700
- [sighs]
- [vibrating]

24:35.766 --> 24:38.869
Oh! That thing startles me every time.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.304
Sorry.

24:41.005 --> 24:43.774
Well, aren't you gonna
find out who it's from?

24:43.841 --> 24:46.744
- It's probably just Stacy or something.
- Hmm.

24:46.811 --> 24:50.748
I may not be very hip, but that rattle
sounds like a boy to me.

24:50.815 --> 24:53.284
Besides, you've been smiling
too much lately.

24:56.387 --> 24:58.756
[chiming]

25:01.225 --> 25:03.461
Oh, you kids and your thumbs.

25:03.527 --> 25:05.596
All day long, tap, tap, tap, tap.

25:05.663 --> 25:07.798
He's just a friend, Grandma.

25:07.865 --> 25:09.366
Uh-huh.

25:11.235 --> 25:12.603
[chiming]

25:12.670 --> 25:14.438
"No Fear Guy"?

25:14.505 --> 25:17.975
Doesn't sound very friendly to me.

25:18.042 --> 25:19.043
[chuckles]

25:20.511 --> 25:22.313
So how'd it go with Governor Solis?

25:22.379 --> 25:25.382
You know the score, Dickie.
She's got three finalists in mind.

25:25.449 --> 25:28.385
I've rescheduled Senator Colby,
and Ambassador Manchester

25:28.452 --> 25:31.055
is later today, if she wants
to keep the appointment.

25:31.122 --> 25:32.323
What a disaster.

25:32.389 --> 25:34.992
Since when is a distinguished
former two-term governor

25:35.059 --> 25:36.894
and ambassador to China a disaster?

25:36.961 --> 25:39.063
He's from Maine,
for crying out loud. Maine.

25:39.130 --> 25:41.265
Are we crazy?
Three electoral votes. Three.

25:41.332 --> 25:45.936
So let me think about it. What's better,
Maine with three or Texas with 34?

25:46.003 --> 25:48.873
- Am I losing my mind?
- I'd like to test that.

25:48.939 --> 25:50.941
I'm getting too old for this.

25:52.076 --> 25:54.345
Did we get the return call
from the White House?

25:54.411 --> 25:56.413
Uh, not yet.

25:57.414 --> 26:01.185
Not too many left in this building
who stand when I walk into a room.

26:01.252 --> 26:03.154
- Thank you.
- Mr. Speaker, this is...

26:03.220 --> 26:05.523
- Nathan Templeton.
- Colin James. Pleasure.

26:05.589 --> 26:08.225
- New star intern.
- Star? You get a star rating.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.561
It's not easy to impress Jayne.
Welcome.

26:10.628 --> 26:13.297
Thank you.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.900
- Thank you.
- I hope it's not too presumptuous,

26:15.966 --> 26:19.603
but I was wondering if I might sit in
on staff meetings from time to time.

26:19.670 --> 26:22.973
I-I know I'm just a student,
but I'm pretty politically minded.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.043
- Are you old enough to vote?
- I voted for President Bridges

26:26.110 --> 26:27.878
- in the last election.
- Good.

26:27.945 --> 26:30.214
I never was too crazy
about his running mate.

26:30.281 --> 26:31.849
Oh, she's a bright girl.

26:31.916 --> 26:34.752
Well, we'll do what we can,
get you in a meeting somewhere.

26:34.819 --> 26:36.220
Thank you, sir.

26:36.287 --> 26:37.788
Lucky you.

26:52.203 --> 26:53.537
Come in.

26:56.140 --> 26:59.143
Oh, thank you, Vince.
I could drink the whole pot.

27:02.346 --> 27:05.616
The quality of the help
is really improving around here.

27:05.683 --> 27:08.085
Welcome home.
Happy birthday.

27:08.152 --> 27:09.620
Mm.

27:11.555 --> 27:14.191
I... sent in nine men.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.027
- Nine? Is that all?
- Yeah.

27:17.094 --> 27:20.898
I've been reading the, uh,
service records of the team.

27:20.965 --> 27:24.368
These guys have more impressive
rÃ©sumÃ©s than any of us do.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.637
Sky-high IQs,

27:26.704 --> 27:29.073
top in their class
in every kind of training.

27:29.139 --> 27:31.475
This one...

27:31.542 --> 27:32.776
...speaks Kurmanci.

27:32.843 --> 27:34.979
- Kurmanci?
- Yeah, it's the native tongue

27:35.045 --> 27:37.982
of the founder
of the Kurdish terrorist group.

27:38.048 --> 27:40.584
Twelve hours ago,
I didn't even know it existed.

27:40.651 --> 27:44.054
This one was an all-American
in squash.

27:45.089 --> 27:46.423
Five of them are married.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.626
They have seven kids
between them.

27:51.528 --> 27:54.431
I don't know if I feel up
for going out tonight.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.267
Totally understand.

27:56.333 --> 27:59.870
It just, uh... it doesn't
feel right, considering.

27:59.937 --> 28:01.739
Well, maybe we
can just order up pizza.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.140
Yeah.

28:04.808 --> 28:05.809
What?

28:05.876 --> 28:08.479
Oh, well...

28:08.545 --> 28:09.994
One of the special ops I sent in.

28:10.060 --> 28:12.496
He's just a few years older
than Horace.

28:13.831 --> 28:15.332
[Vince] Excuse me, ma'am.

28:15.399 --> 28:17.935
You're needed in the Situation Room.

28:18.569 --> 28:19.737
Sorry.

28:25.309 --> 28:27.278
- What happened?
- The Bosporus currents

28:27.344 --> 28:29.446
were much stronger
than we anticipated.

28:29.513 --> 28:32.349
We, uh, don't know
the exact sequence of events.

28:32.416 --> 28:35.820
We were out of direct radio contact,
but one of our guys didn't make it.

28:35.886 --> 28:39.223
His body was recovered
downstream of the access point.

28:39.857 --> 28:42.226
- We're down to eight men.
- That's correct, ma'am.

28:42.293 --> 28:44.395
- The rest of them are in position?
- They are.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.697
What does the team leader say?
He want to abort?

28:46.764 --> 28:48.566
- We asked him, ma'am.
- And...?

28:48.632 --> 28:51.068
His exact quote was "try and stop us."

28:51.135 --> 28:52.837
The team leader said that?

28:52.903 --> 28:55.606
These Delta guys play
by a different set of rules, ma'am.

28:55.673 --> 28:58.142
They're a different kind of soldier.

28:58.209 --> 28:59.977
- Send them in.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:01.545 --> 29:03.280
Operation Sudden Thunder is go.

29:03.347 --> 29:05.649
I say again, Sudden Thunder is go.

29:07.551 --> 29:09.553
[man] Ma'am, radio contact initiated.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.488
[man 2] Red sky, position one.

29:11.555 --> 29:13.490
- Do they know?
- Ma'am?

29:13.557 --> 29:15.626
About the member
of their team who died?

29:16.560 --> 29:19.263
They know he's nonoperational.

29:19.330 --> 29:21.131
[man 2] Clear sky, position two.

29:21.198 --> 29:22.900
How's it going?

29:22.967 --> 29:24.702
Too early.

29:24.768 --> 29:26.437
Ambassador Manchester's waiting.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.572
I was gonna cancel.
I wanted to check first.

29:28.639 --> 29:30.541
[man] We've reached
the basement door.

29:30.608 --> 29:33.510
We estimate 20 to 25 minutes
to gain access.

29:33.577 --> 29:35.846
- Anthony.
- The second we hear anything.

29:40.017 --> 29:42.786
Thanks for coming outside.
I needed to clear my head.

29:42.853 --> 29:45.789
And I was afraid if I sat down
I might fall asleep,

29:45.856 --> 29:49.093
and then you'd think I was bored,
and we'd be off to a terrific start.

29:49.159 --> 29:51.495
I'm from Maine.
We think boring is a virtue.

29:51.996 --> 29:54.498
I don't mean to pry,
but any good news out of Turkey?

29:54.565 --> 29:56.133
We're working it.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.335
Shot for the crime
of being an American.

29:59.403 --> 30:02.673
When I was in law school, I backpacked
through Europe one summer.

30:02.740 --> 30:05.142
I had a big American flag on my pack.

30:05.209 --> 30:07.945
Now the State Department
advises American tourists

30:08.012 --> 30:10.514
not to display any sign
of their nationality.

30:10.581 --> 30:12.950
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

30:13.417 --> 30:16.654
You know, I've been president
less than a year,

30:16.720 --> 30:19.056
and I'm already on
my second vice president.

30:19.123 --> 30:20.724
You sure you want this job?

30:22.626 --> 30:25.162
I know the protocol.
I'm supposed to play hard to get,

30:25.229 --> 30:28.565
act sort of interested and tell you
that I don't really need the job.

30:28.632 --> 30:30.134
But that isn't true.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.436
I want to be vice president, badly.

30:32.503 --> 30:34.705
- That's refreshing. Why?
- Don't get me wrong.

30:34.772 --> 30:37.775
- I'd rather be president.
- That job's taken.

30:37.841 --> 30:41.078
I was elected to statewide office
in Maine four times as a Democrat.

30:41.145 --> 30:44.548
Thought I'd never run again. But I got
so mad at the guy who succeeded me,

30:44.615 --> 30:47.851
another Democrat, that I ran against him
as an Independent and won.

30:47.918 --> 30:50.721
Why don't you run for president
as an Independent?

30:50.788 --> 30:54.258
I'm never gonna run for president.
I can't win on my own. I'd get killed.

30:54.325 --> 30:55.659
Any Independent would.

30:55.726 --> 30:59.530
Unless, somehow,
that Independent became president

30:59.596 --> 31:02.833
and could run as an incumbent
from the White House.

31:02.900 --> 31:05.636
Then... you just might have a shot.

31:05.703 --> 31:08.138
Dickie McDonald
thinks you're a disaster.

31:08.205 --> 31:10.207
[laughs] I can guarantee Dickie

31:10.274 --> 31:12.509
I will deliver Maine's
three electoral votes.

31:12.576 --> 31:14.411
- That is a mortal lock.
- [chuckles]

31:15.212 --> 31:18.282
- [Jim] How'd it go with Manchester?
- He seemed nervous.

31:18.349 --> 31:20.084
I can't imagine why.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.619
Interviewing for
the second most important job...

31:22.686 --> 31:25.356
I suppose so.
Younger than I remember.

31:25.422 --> 31:28.492
Sleep will do that to you.
What about Governor Solis?

31:28.559 --> 31:30.294
Oh, very impressive, very.

31:30.361 --> 31:34.365
He has really turned around
the public school system in Texas.

31:35.299 --> 31:36.367
But...?

31:36.433 --> 31:39.503
Did you know that,
for a quarter of our nation's history,

31:39.570 --> 31:41.372
we've been without a vice president?

31:41.438 --> 31:43.273
You're saying that you'd like to wait?

31:43.340 --> 31:46.310
I'm saying that I don't want
to rush into this decision.

31:46.377 --> 31:48.746
I've been through
a lot of potential candidates,

31:48.812 --> 31:51.348
and to be honest,
I'm not sparking to any of them.

31:51.415 --> 31:53.650
And what about Templeton
staying next in line?

31:53.717 --> 31:55.953
We'll pray lightning
doesn't strike twice.

31:56.020 --> 31:58.422
- Let's, uh, reschedule Senator Colby.
- Done.

31:58.489 --> 32:00.991
And we'll keep searching
for other candidates.

32:01.058 --> 32:03.494
- What about you?
- Me?

32:06.830 --> 32:08.232
Think about it.

32:11.335 --> 32:13.270
[man] Delta Force in final position.

32:13.337 --> 32:15.205
Red team, blue team, this is a go.

32:15.272 --> 32:17.007
- Go, go, go, go!
- [door kicked open]

32:17.074 --> 32:18.642
- [screaming]
- [shouting]

32:18.709 --> 32:20.644
Get down! Get on your knees!

32:20.711 --> 32:22.780
- Move it!
- [man 2] I want to see your hands.

32:22.846 --> 32:25.115
- [man 1] Gun, gun, gun!
- [gunfire]

32:25.182 --> 32:26.750
[men shouting]

32:26.817 --> 32:28.819
Lay down on the ground!

32:28.886 --> 32:30.654
Put your hands up
where I can see them.

32:30.721 --> 32:33.824
- Operation Sudden Thunder secure.
- [Allyson] Roger, secure.

32:33.891 --> 32:36.260
- Casualties.
- Two American hostages wounded.

32:36.326 --> 32:39.897
Stabilizing now. We have eight
terrorists KIA, two wounded.

32:39.963 --> 32:43.500
- [Allyson] Say friendly casualties.
- Negative. Cuts and bruises only.

32:43.567 --> 32:45.669
[radio crackles]

32:47.638 --> 32:50.707
Very well, team leader. Outstanding.
Let's get 'em outta there.

32:50.774 --> 32:52.242
Roger that.

32:52.309 --> 32:55.245
He did a job in Yemen
and reported cuts and bruises,

32:55.312 --> 32:59.817
which turned out to be shrapnel
and two flesh wounds from an AK-47.

32:59.883 --> 33:03.353
- I want to talk to him and his team...
- [explosion]

33:03.420 --> 33:04.988
- [shouting]
- [gunfire]

33:05.055 --> 33:06.623
[man] Get down!

33:06.690 --> 33:08.692
- [gunfire]
- [screaming]

33:08.759 --> 33:10.994
To the right! [screaming]

33:12.763 --> 33:14.698
[radio crackling]

33:17.134 --> 33:18.869
Team leader, say status.

33:18.936 --> 33:22.673
[man] Delta Team leader down.
We are evacuating hostages.

33:22.739 --> 33:25.008
We have wounded and KIA.

33:25.075 --> 33:26.643
Sir, are you all right? This way.

33:26.710 --> 33:30.080
Need medic immediately.
Outside, let's go.

33:38.722 --> 33:42.159
I spoke to the head trauma surgeon
who'll be on the medevac to Germany.

33:42.226 --> 33:44.161
He thinks everyone will make it.

33:44.228 --> 33:46.363
Thank God.

33:46.430 --> 33:49.333
An initial debrief indicates
that the Delta Team

33:49.399 --> 33:51.502
missed two terrorists in the assault.

33:51.568 --> 33:55.038
Those two attacked the Delta Team
as they were leading the hostages out.

33:55.105 --> 33:56.607
One was a suicide bomber.

33:58.575 --> 34:01.111
The Delta Team leader
charged the suicide bomber

34:01.178 --> 34:02.846
and took most of the blast.

34:05.849 --> 34:09.485
Two dead hostages,
12 more wounded

34:09.553 --> 34:12.489
and three dead on the Delta Team.

34:12.556 --> 34:14.757
And 12 dead terrorists,
killed by the team.

34:14.824 --> 34:18.562
A full Delta team wouldn't have missed
those last two terrorists.

34:18.629 --> 34:21.197
The hostages are saying the plan
was to kill all of them.

34:21.264 --> 34:22.498
Our sources confirm.

34:22.565 --> 34:25.202
I think you averted a total
and complete catastrophe.

34:25.268 --> 34:26.536
Madam President,

34:26.603 --> 34:29.406
considering the dangers
inherent in a mission like this,

34:30.340 --> 34:31.440
I think it's a miracle.

34:32.476 --> 34:34.811
Even the press is with us
on this one, ma'am.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.714
We're done here.

34:40.951 --> 34:44.288
- This is a complete list of the dead?
- Yes, ma'am.

34:44.353 --> 34:46.255
Uh, Ortez?

34:47.424 --> 34:49.927
He was the 21-year-old
Special Forces soldier?

34:49.993 --> 34:51.562
Yes, ma'am.

35:04.374 --> 35:06.910
[woman] Ortez was 21 years old.

35:06.977 --> 35:09.246
He was based out
of the Delta Force head...

35:09.313 --> 35:11.315
- [turns TV off]
- What a day.

35:14.351 --> 35:17.254
That Lance character's right, isn't he?

35:17.921 --> 35:21.592
I can't count on the election
getting thrown into the House

35:21.658 --> 35:23.126
and beating her that way.

35:23.193 --> 35:27.598
But you can win it outright, Nate.
You've prepared all your life for this.

35:27.664 --> 35:29.967
For being president.

35:30.033 --> 35:32.035
Being's a lot different than running.

35:33.470 --> 35:36.807
I'm a used car, sweetheart.
She's a new model.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.409
We must never underestimate

35:39.476 --> 35:41.945
what a formidable candidate she can be.

35:42.012 --> 35:44.815
- That's why we need Lance.
- [sighs]

35:46.917 --> 35:49.486
Do you really want this,
my darling?

35:49.553 --> 35:51.622
I do. Don't you?

35:55.425 --> 35:57.861
I want it so badly I can taste it.

36:01.498 --> 36:03.667
Mr. Speaker, the call went through.

36:03.734 --> 36:05.402
Thank you.

36:11.308 --> 36:13.644
Madam President,
thank you for taking my call.

36:13.710 --> 36:15.679
I hope you're recovering well.

36:15.746 --> 36:16.913
I'm fine.

36:16.980 --> 36:20.017
It's been a long day for you,
to be sure.

36:20.884 --> 36:22.519
What can I do for you, Mr. Speaker?

36:22.586 --> 36:25.656
[stammering] I was just calling
because I wanted to...

36:25.722 --> 36:29.259
Because Sarah and I wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

36:30.060 --> 36:31.728
Thank you.

36:32.796 --> 36:36.466
So... happy birthday, Madam President.

36:39.870 --> 36:41.171
Is there something else?

36:42.272 --> 36:45.008
No. No, no, no. No, no.
I-I won't keep you.

36:45.075 --> 36:47.511
My best to you and your family.

36:48.211 --> 36:50.547
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night, Mr. Speaker.

36:51.148 --> 36:53.216
[dial tone]

36:59.823 --> 37:02.192
[chuckling] Hey, Mom.

37:03.260 --> 37:05.162
Oh, um, are you OK?

37:05.228 --> 37:07.664
Oh, yeah.

37:07.731 --> 37:10.267
- We'll come back later.
- No, no. Listen,

37:10.334 --> 37:13.503
I know you guys hate this,
but tough.

37:13.570 --> 37:16.873
- [laughs]
- Mm. Mmm.

37:16.940 --> 37:19.843
We can do this again next year
for your birthday, I promise.

37:19.910 --> 37:22.646
Here you go. Don't get
your hopes up. [laughs]

37:26.116 --> 37:29.052
- Oh, you guys.
- [Horace] Don't start crying.

37:29.119 --> 37:31.088
Do you know this is
the first book that...?

37:31.154 --> 37:33.090
You ever read us.

37:33.156 --> 37:34.257
[Rod] Hey.

37:34.324 --> 37:37.361
[laughs] The pizza's here.

37:37.427 --> 37:38.929
- Great. I'm starving.
- Me too.

37:38.995 --> 37:41.531
- Look what they got me.
- [Rebecca] Why not?

37:41.598 --> 37:44.201
All our friends are going
to Europe to backpack.

37:44.267 --> 37:45.736
Yeah, you did it, Mom.

37:45.802 --> 37:48.872
I don't think your mom had
Secret Service agents with her.

37:48.939 --> 37:51.608
- I still have my Eurail pass.
- Can I go?

37:51.675 --> 37:54.211
It'll only be for three weeks.

37:54.277 --> 37:55.412
Two weeks.

37:55.479 --> 37:57.481
Ten days, and I'll call every day.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.151
[all] Surprise!

38:01.218 --> 38:02.753
[cheering, applause]

38:05.989 --> 38:08.024
[man] Happy birthday,
Madam President!

38:19.770 --> 38:22.939
[woman] ...beautiful.
You've grown so much.

38:23.006 --> 38:25.142
- You must be very proud of them.
- I am. I am.

38:25.208 --> 38:27.344
- Thank you.
- Oh, I want to introduce you...

38:27.411 --> 38:29.312
- Oh, sure.
- I'll see you in a second.

38:30.981 --> 38:32.749
I can't believe you didn't tell us.

38:32.816 --> 38:34.484
Sneaky. Very sneaky.

38:34.551 --> 38:36.686
Hey, she loved that book.

38:36.753 --> 38:39.423
- It was Rebecca's idea.
- Oh, I'm shocked.

38:39.489 --> 38:41.291
You know, I never got to do

38:41.358 --> 38:43.860
the whole backpacking
in Europe thing either.

38:44.761 --> 38:46.430
Maybe I should go with you.

38:46.496 --> 38:48.331
That will never happen.

38:48.932 --> 38:52.402
- But it was a good father-son gesture.
- Yeah, I thought so. [chuckles]

38:53.537 --> 38:55.338
[Mac] I can't believe it.

38:55.405 --> 38:58.008
- Three years.
- You look great.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.477
No, I don't.
I haven't slept for two days.

39:00.544 --> 39:02.212
And the twins are adorable.

39:02.279 --> 39:05.282
- Happy birthday, Madam President.
- Oh.

39:05.348 --> 39:07.150
Thanks.

39:07.217 --> 39:09.553
Oh. How's Tom?

39:09.619 --> 39:12.088
- Oh, he finally made partner.
- Great. Wonderful.

39:12.155 --> 39:14.825
Oh, it better be. I worked
my tail off for his partnership.

39:14.891 --> 39:17.527
You know how many times
I left work early to cover at home?

39:17.594 --> 39:19.796
Have you talked to Rod
about this? [laughs]

39:19.863 --> 39:21.431
[laughs] Oh, well, finally,

39:21.498 --> 39:24.100
I just gave in to the inevitable
and left the firm.

39:24.167 --> 39:26.603
So now I volunteer when I can
at the legal aid office

39:26.670 --> 39:30.574
of the domestic violence shelter.
Hey, you know, you cut our budget.

39:30.640 --> 39:31.708
- I did?
- Yeah.

39:31.775 --> 39:34.444
Bridges did.
Well... I wrote you about it.

39:34.511 --> 39:37.047
I didn't get it. I'm so sorry.
I'll look into it.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.783
You know, I will settle
for the ambassadorship

39:39.850 --> 39:43.854
to some small, warm country
with a great beach.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.989
- Me too.
- [both laughing]

39:46.056 --> 39:49.059
- Just like our freshman dorm.
- Uh, maybe your side of the room.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.127
- Oh!
- [laughs]

39:53.129 --> 39:55.332
I can't imagine what
it must be like for you.

39:55.398 --> 39:59.269
The constant pressure,
that horrible thing over in Turkey.

40:00.403 --> 40:02.739
I am really proud of you, Mac.

40:02.806 --> 40:04.474
- Madam President, excuse me.
- Oh.

40:04.541 --> 40:06.409
[whispering]

40:06.476 --> 40:08.812
- Excuse me.
- Oh, of course.

40:15.151 --> 40:17.087
Is everything all right?

40:17.153 --> 40:19.222
Yeah, just have a couple
of calls to finish.

40:19.289 --> 40:21.558
- Was this OK?
- It was wonderful.

40:21.625 --> 40:24.761
'Cause I was kinda trapped.
Everyone had already flown in.

40:24.828 --> 40:27.163
You can imagine how excited
they were to see you.

40:27.230 --> 40:30.600
- Rod, I needed this.
- Yeah, you did.

40:38.441 --> 40:39.776
[rings]

40:39.843 --> 40:41.378
[chiming]

40:41.444 --> 40:43.780
[Horace] Why do you bail
on me at these things?

40:43.847 --> 40:46.716
I got stuck talking to Mom's
law professor, Ms. Glasser.

40:46.783 --> 40:48.785
- Smells.
- [chiming]

40:48.852 --> 40:51.588
Shoulda known.
Who's online?

40:51.655 --> 40:54.224
- Lexi.
- Who?

40:54.291 --> 40:56.159
Oh, you don't know her.
Honors English.

40:56.226 --> 40:57.727
[chiming]

40:57.794 --> 41:00.196
- You gonna look at that thing?
- You gonna leave?

41:01.598 --> 41:02.933
Whatever.

41:13.610 --> 41:14.945
[rings]

41:22.886 --> 41:24.220
[neck cracks]

41:25.689 --> 41:28.291
[Jayne] Go home.
The speaker is gone.

41:28.358 --> 41:30.360
Take advantage of the early evening.

41:30.827 --> 41:33.363
Uh, I'm leaving now.
I could walk out with you.

41:33.430 --> 41:36.466
I-I have some ideas
that I'd like to bounce off you.

41:36.533 --> 41:38.535
[vacuum whirring]

41:44.374 --> 41:45.709
[turns vacuum off]

41:47.377 --> 41:50.046
- Good evening, Henry.
- Good evening, ma'am.

41:52.849 --> 41:53.984
[woman] Hello.

41:54.050 --> 41:56.453
Mrs. Ortez, this is President Allen.

41:57.454 --> 42:00.457
I wanted to express my sorrow
at the loss of your son.

42:00.523 --> 42:03.860
I know that there's little
that I could say

42:03.927 --> 42:06.396
to ease your pain,

42:06.463 --> 42:09.666
but I hope there's some comfort

42:09.733 --> 42:12.602
in knowing that he gave his life

42:12.669 --> 42:15.605
saving many, many American lives,

42:15.672 --> 42:19.809
and his country will always be
grateful for that,

42:19.876 --> 42:23.213
and to you for the sacrifice
that you both have made.
