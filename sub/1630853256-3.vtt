<i> This is the last stop.</i>
<i>Astor Place, last stop.</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:38.371
<i>This train is now going out of service.</i>

00:38.455 --> 00:41.666
<i>Please take your belongings.</i>
<i>This is the last stop. Have a good night.</i>

00:43.835 --> 00:44.669
Hey.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.463
Last stop.

00:48.798 --> 00:49.674
Last stop.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.823
Hey, uh, did you see any gold coins?

01:13.907 --> 01:17.410
A hundred and forty-nine of 'em?
I lost them on this train.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.037
You should get out of here.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.998
The cops sweep the train
around this time every morning.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.124
If you look crazy,

01:23.208 --> 01:26.211
they'll find some yuppie
to sign a complaint and lock you up.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.839
And, no offense, but you look crazy.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.882
Yeah, thanks, I got it.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.300
-Let's go.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.426
Let's get you out of here.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.888
Listen, do you know is there like
an MTA "lost and found" or anything?

01:36.971 --> 01:40.225
No, it doesn't exist.
It's a myth, like El Dorado.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.893
-Ah, city of gold.
-Yeah.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.603
Apparently not a stop on my train.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.271
Uh-huh. I got to get to work.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.189
All right.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.566
The steps,
they're over there, okay?

01:48.650 --> 01:49.734
Okay, thanks.

02:06.751 --> 02:07.627
Ah!

02:09.587 --> 02:12.632
I fucked up, Ruthie,
uh, big-time.

02:12.715 --> 02:13.883
Showering, but…

02:13.967 --> 02:15.426
Yeah. Thanks.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.555
Anyway, I am not going back to 2022

02:18.638 --> 02:20.807
until I make things right
between Vera and Nora, Ruth.

02:20.890 --> 02:21.933
I'm not doing it.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.184
Nora?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.019
Not on my watch, all right?

02:25.103 --> 02:26.312
Uh, I am…

02:27.522 --> 02:28.481
on the case.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.399
So…

02:30.567 --> 02:32.026
can't fool me.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.361
Uh…

02:33.444 --> 02:34.445
I got this.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.447
Nora, are you feeling okay?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.408
Me? Am I feeling okay?

02:38.491 --> 02:40.410
Eh, now that you mention it,

02:40.493 --> 02:42.620
I'm not feeling so hot.
I'm a little bit off.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.665
Uh, case in point,
I used to hate menthols,

02:45.748 --> 02:49.919
and now, uh, hooked on cyan,
just like my schizo mom, huh?

02:50.920 --> 02:52.380
Weird, weird, weird.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.717
Little Jodie Foster
in<i> Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.</i>

02:55.800 --> 02:58.011
That's, uh, around now, right?

02:58.094 --> 03:00.180
Let me get ready, okay? We're almost late.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.850
Where are we going
and does it involve taking the train?

03:03.933 --> 03:06.311
Well, the three of us
are going to the hospital.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.354
Baby time.

03:09.981 --> 03:10.815
Huh.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.164
Hi, Vera.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.958
Nora Vulvokov?

03:32.795 --> 03:35.840
The doctor is going to need
a urine sample. Thanks.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.760
Splish, splash.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.729
What are you doing?

03:49.812 --> 03:51.773
You know,
it's one of those rare situations

03:51.856 --> 03:53.942
in which it's exactly what it looks like.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.402
You did not come home last night.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.739
I stay up waiting all night.

03:59.822 --> 04:00.782
No Nora.

04:00.865 --> 04:05.203
Well, I had the gold,
and then I lost it on the train, but…

04:06.079 --> 04:07.914
I swear I'm gonna fix everything.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.041
You only break things, Lenora.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.209
You break trust.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.753
-You break promise. You are broken.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.800
Now you see this, this is why I prefer
to piss in cups in private.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.309
"She who has a head of wax
cannot walk in the sun."

04:28.393 --> 04:29.310
What the fuck?

04:29.394 --> 04:30.853
Wait, wha--

04:30.937 --> 04:32.647
Why do I understand Hungarian?

04:32.730 --> 04:34.232
Your first word was Hungarian.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.442
"Dog."

04:36.526 --> 04:39.279
You spoke only Hungarian
until you were four.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.738
Not exactly.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.074
Uh, that's, uh, Nora.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.576
You see, Nora spoke Hungarian, not me.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.412
Me? I'm Nadia.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.081
Nora, you have to be strong.

04:50.665 --> 04:54.752
You are all you can depend on
in this world.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.337
This fucking life.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.715
They took everything,

04:59.590 --> 05:01.092
put it on the gold train.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.177
Gold disappears,

05:03.261 --> 05:05.263
then gold reappears.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.806
The Krugerrands.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.891
But it disappears again.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.853
Jesus, it's like fucking HPV, this gold.

05:11.936 --> 05:15.690
So you're telling me that this family
lost its gold twice on a train

05:15.773 --> 05:17.984
under suspicious
metaphysical circumstances?

05:18.067 --> 05:20.611
I mean,
that can't be a coincidence.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.822
First as tragedy, then as farce, etcetera.

05:22.905 --> 05:23.740
Nah.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.869
There are things in life
that cannot be explained.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.331
They would think I'm insane.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.751
Laugh at me, throw me out like garbage.

05:34.834 --> 05:39.380
Well, inexplicable things happening
is my entire modus operandi.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.051
Grandma, tell me.
Tell me exactly what happened.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.014
Is everything all right in here?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.141
Ah, terrific.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.770
Just so you know, uh,

05:53.853 --> 05:57.398
I'm not entirely sure
exactly whose urine this is.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.777
This will feel a little cold.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.195
Ah.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.738
Sicko, huh?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.950
The most important thing
in these last couple of weeks

06:08.034 --> 06:10.703
is to get lots of rest, stay calm,

06:11.287 --> 06:13.414
don't put any stress on the body.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.090
Do you have any questions?

06:22.173 --> 06:25.885
Uh, big-time, yeah. Uh-huh.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.555
Do you think consciousness
is an emergent property of the brain?

06:29.639 --> 06:33.726
Like, could one person's consciousness
just displace someone else's?

06:33.810 --> 06:38.022
You know, uh, two minds
knocking around the same body?

06:38.106 --> 06:41.192
-That type of a thing?
-No, never heard of that.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.069
I'm assuming that
most of your patients

06:43.152 --> 06:45.571
grapple with bringing
more consciousnesses into existence?

06:45.655 --> 06:48.449
Nora, being born
doesn't make you a victim.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.786
Let's get you home.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.037
Jelly towel?

06:54.372 --> 06:55.415
Jelly towel.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.752
…the baby…

07:00.670 --> 07:02.004
…gold train…

07:03.423 --> 07:04.841
…losing it…

07:07.009 --> 07:08.928
…Con Edison…

07:10.972 --> 07:14.350
Hey, did you say
you were going to the electric company?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.811
-Grandma. What the fu--

07:16.894 --> 07:19.522
Your mother thinks
it's best for you to stay here.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.524
Best for you and the baby.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.444
The baby, the baby. I mean, come on.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.237
Enough with the babies.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.572
Hey, you want a drink?

07:33.911 --> 07:37.081
No, I get it.
You speak Hungarian. That's-- Okay.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.208
One for me and one for you.

07:40.918 --> 07:45.214
Delia, do you remember anything
about this gold train?

07:45.298 --> 07:48.050
Like, uh, did it happen
to your family too?

07:48.134 --> 07:53.139
They didn't respect us Romani enough
to steal from us.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.016
But we survived.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.602
Everything is hidden,

07:57.685 --> 07:59.395
just in case.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.354
Yeah.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.948
I go to my apartment
and bring back something worth drinking.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.284
Sounds like a plan.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.414
-This is shit.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.042
Ugh.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.960
Who the fuck are you?

08:23.461 --> 08:26.255
This fucking house
is obsessed with babies.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.758
Fucking around with people.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.468
Ah.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.305
Did not know babies were so rich.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.395
What else is good hiding in here?

08:43.898 --> 08:45.733
Give me a clue. Give me a clue.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.862
Hey, Mommy.

08:52.823 --> 08:53.866
Hello.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.036
Those fucking good genetics, huh?

08:57.537 --> 08:58.454
Ah.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.581
Hello, Grandpa.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.834
Uh, got any secrets for me?

09:05.503 --> 09:06.796
Don't look at me.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.425
Uh, bingo.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.394
Ah!

09:22.144 --> 09:23.646
Dad's transcript.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.147
Not cool.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.483
Come on.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.944
Just be a good little luck for a bit.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.698
What happened to your face?

09:33.781 --> 09:34.657
Huh?

09:36.075 --> 09:36.993
Oh.

09:38.369 --> 09:42.582
And, uh,
some reading material for the train.

09:44.083 --> 09:44.917
Very good.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.920
What the fuck?

09:50.006 --> 09:50.840
Huh.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.722
That's not good.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.144
Maybe it's been too much Mommy-in-me time.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.146
Nora, Nora.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.066
Time to skip the rails.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.369
<i>G. G. Give me G.</i>

10:20.453 --> 10:22.747
There's Packard, naturalists and shit.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.291
Engineering. Where's the fucking Gs?

10:25.374 --> 10:26.250
G. G.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.335
G. G.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.003
Ah! G.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.755
Gold train. Give me gold train.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.173
"Galileo. Goethe."

10:32.256 --> 10:34.884
"Golightly." No Golightly. Fuck Golightly.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.053
"Grand unification, theory of--"

10:37.136 --> 10:39.805
What am I doing?
It should be "train comma gold."

10:46.646 --> 10:49.190
Please don't expose those slides
to the overhead lights.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.274
They'll fade.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.318
Ah. Then how am I supposed
to look at them?

10:52.401 --> 10:53.861
My job isn't to look at them.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.530
My job is to preserve them
so they can be looked at in the future.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.659
I see. You're immune to paradox.
Uh, I'd like to check these out, please.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.577
In-library use only.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.953
Those are originals.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.665
You librarians really love
hoarding information, don't you?

11:05.748 --> 11:08.084
I wouldn't say I love it,
but I certainly like it a lot.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.418
It's borderline pathological.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.712
I'm not the one losing my mind.

11:11.796 --> 11:15.716
Let's go. Everybody out.
This isn't a hotel.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.842
Donut time.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.102
-So, what I need to know is,

11:26.185 --> 11:29.647
where do the ducks go in Central Park
when the pond freezes in the winter?

11:29.730 --> 11:32.775
"Where do the ducks go?"

11:33.943 --> 11:36.278
We'll look for it
and give you a call later.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.448
Ah, duck, duck, goose step, my turn.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.201
All right, Ethel,
I need to make this quick

11:42.284 --> 11:44.245
'cause I'm pretty sure
that cop is after me.

11:44.328 --> 11:48.582
I'm looking for information
on the whereabouts of a lost gold train

11:48.666 --> 11:50.960
in Budapest during World War II.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.713
Mmm. "Gold train." Mm-hmm.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.548
This is very sensitive, uh,

11:55.631 --> 11:57.842
you know, high-level stuff.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.219
"High-level."

12:00.302 --> 12:01.387
Mm-hmm.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.223
Could you leave your name and your number?

12:04.306 --> 12:06.809
Oh. Fuck, yes.
I do have a name and a number.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.061
So I have both handy, okay?

12:09.645 --> 12:10.521
And, uh…

12:11.689 --> 12:12.523
Hmm.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.525
Hmm.

12:15.609 --> 12:16.694
Mm-hmm.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.612
That's right.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.031
We'll give you a call.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.879
<i>Get it all now, during Crazy Eddie's</i>
<i>greatest stereo sale ever!</i>

12:34.962 --> 12:38.007
<i>I'm Crazy Eddie,</i>
<i>and these prices are insane!</i>

12:38.090 --> 12:41.761
I'm Crazy Eddie,
and these prices are insane!

12:41.844 --> 12:44.764
I'm an actual crazy person. I really am.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.141
It's called a video feedback loop.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.769
It's like standing in between two mirrors.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.146
See, the image is being reflected
over and over,

12:52.229 --> 12:54.940
and you can't just point
at one of those reflections and say,

12:55.024 --> 12:57.276
"Yup, that one's the original."

12:57.359 --> 12:59.153
It's like the beginning of mankind.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.070
Unless--

13:00.571 --> 13:02.281
You're not a creationist, are you?

13:02.364 --> 13:05.701
Ah, wouldn't it be nice
to have someone to blame?

13:05.785 --> 13:09.747
-How can I help you, Nadia?
-Okay. Uh…

13:10.748 --> 13:13.918
Ugh. Nazis. Nazis. Hello.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.337
Here's a little atlas
to the Second World War.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.047
That's not what I'm looking for.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.592
I need a slide projector.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.844
Agfacolor Neu, huh?

13:23.928 --> 13:27.807
These were only in production
a couple years in the late 1930s.

13:27.890 --> 13:28.808
What's on these?

13:28.891 --> 13:31.060
I don't fucking know.
Hence, the projector.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.187
-Give me a second.
-Great.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.439
I think I have one in the back
you could borrow.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.548
Got it. Kodak Ektagraphic III.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.716
Fucking A, a projector.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.218
Thanks, Danny.

14:04.301 --> 14:09.139
Nadia, I want you to know I'm not just
a Crazy Eddie's stockroom associate.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.767
I'm an artist,
and the assistant editor of a zine

14:11.851 --> 14:14.812
about commodity fetishism
and the Debordian spectacle.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.438
All right, well.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.023
We live and we die, huh?

14:18.107 --> 14:20.150
-Yes, that's-- that's true.
-Yeah. Adios.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.992
Nary a sofa.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.580
Ka-bingo.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.666
-Excellent work.

14:35.749 --> 14:38.002
<i>The Book of Secrets. </i>Fucking weirdo.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.880
<i>Psychopathia Sexualis. </i>Into it.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.382
Uh, notes, notes. Thread.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.385
<i>Vibrations. </i>Uh…

14:46.468 --> 14:48.679
Okay, numerology. Great.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.975
Hmm, Albert Peschauer to Vera Peschauer.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.727
"With deep sorrow, I've learned

14:54.810 --> 14:57.771
that your dear parents
have fallen victim to the Nazi tyranny."

14:57.855 --> 14:59.440
"As children of my beloved sister, Eva,

14:59.523 --> 15:01.567
I know it is my duty to care for you
and help you."

15:01.650 --> 15:03.944
That's a P.S. Inconsequential.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.864
Ugh.

15:06.947 --> 15:07.907
What the fuck?

15:08.407 --> 15:09.366
Mold.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.661
There's mold all over this apartment.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.752
Rinsey-rinsey.

15:19.835 --> 15:20.794
Okay.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.424
Hmm.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.509
Hmm?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.720
"All the world was made for you."

15:29.803 --> 15:31.764
"Everything is dust and ashes."

15:37.937 --> 15:39.480
This little piece of shit.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.523
Look at you.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.068
You little fuck.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.196
You little fuck.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.114
Look at you.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.808
What the hell?

16:37.538 --> 16:38.622
Ugh!

16:39.289 --> 16:40.124
Ugh!

16:40.666 --> 16:42.292
What the fuck?

16:43.335 --> 16:44.920
Fuck this!

16:45.004 --> 16:47.172
-Ah!

16:47.256 --> 16:49.299
Told you there were bugs
in this apartment.

16:50.592 --> 16:51.427
Mommy.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.096
'Cause there's mold on the floor
and the walls.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.889
I called Vera twice about it already.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.267
She swears the super
ripped the whole place apart

16:58.350 --> 16:59.601
and didn't find a trace of mold.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.645
I don't believe her. Do you believe her?

17:01.729 --> 17:03.731
I don't believe her. I believe you, Mommy.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.983
My smart baby. I knew you would.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.360
Huh!

17:08.444 --> 17:10.404
Now she's had the electricity turned off.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.073
She's trying to control us,
but it's not gonna work.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.580
I'm hungry.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.959
Hi. Uh…

17:24.543 --> 17:28.630
Can I get two packs of Bennett & Hammond's
Ultra Light mentholated 100s, please?

17:28.714 --> 17:29.923
Sure thing, Nora.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.177
You love these water crackers,
don't you, baby?

17:33.260 --> 17:37.014
Water crackers, some tomatoes, scallions…

17:37.097 --> 17:38.348
Not so fresh, but…

17:38.891 --> 17:40.142
You want some cheese?

17:40.726 --> 17:41.643
Yeah, Mom.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.603
This…

17:43.395 --> 17:44.605
Long night, huh?

17:45.898 --> 17:46.857
Yeah.

17:46.940 --> 17:47.900
How you doing?

17:47.983 --> 17:49.068
I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.361
The junkies keep coming in here,
asking for change.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.905
How are you? How's the baby?

17:52.988 --> 17:54.948
Yeah, the baby is good.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.492
The baby is real good.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.660
Orange is the color of fascination.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.245
Huh. Here you go.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.706
Um, can I get a lighter too, please?

18:02.790 --> 18:03.624
Sure.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.710
Just don't light the cheese on fire, huh?

18:06.794 --> 18:09.088
Huh, okay.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.094
Keep the change, okay?

18:18.138 --> 18:19.306
See you tomorrow.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.812
The gold train and the Krugerrands
are connected. But how?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.855
And what does Vera know about it?

18:27.564 --> 18:29.817
In 1939, Vera was--

18:29.900 --> 18:32.528
A total bitch, like she always is.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.323
I mean, how dare she try
to puppeteer our lives.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.451
Look, this is Dohány Street.

18:39.993 --> 18:40.828
Huh.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.037
That's Delia, right?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.414
I had half a mind to become a Catholic
just to piss her off.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.459
One of the world's great rebels, Mommy.
I've heard it before.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.254
Okay, 1944.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.296
Look at this.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.466
Full-blown war, and everybody's out there
having picnics like a bunch of nutjobs.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.469
You know, Deuteronomy
didn't allow any images of God?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.514
And what a loss,
never to see something so beautiful.

19:00.597 --> 19:03.433
Yeah, more false idols,
that's what we need.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.688
Holy shit, there it is.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.525
That's it, right? Is that the gold train?

19:11.608 --> 19:13.569
I think God is a tree,

19:13.652 --> 19:14.695
or a wheel.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.620
I'll get it.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.710
-Hello?
-<i>It's the New York Public Library.</i>

19:29.793 --> 19:30.627
The library?

19:30.711 --> 19:32.754
I'm busy with my daughter.
Don't call back.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.672
No, wait!

19:35.841 --> 19:36.675
Yes, hello?

19:36.758 --> 19:40.304
Ethel Sorter calling you
from the New York Public Library

19:40.387 --> 19:42.055
with the information you requested

19:42.139 --> 19:44.266
<i>about the lost gold train.</i>

19:44.349 --> 19:48.729
<i>"As the Soviet army</i>
<i>advanced on Budapest in 1944,</i>

19:48.812 --> 19:53.442
the Schutzstaffel sought to evacuate
the possessions of Hungarian Jews."

19:53.525 --> 19:57.321
<i>"They forced Jewish families</i>
<i>to hand over items of value,</i>

19:57.404 --> 20:00.908
<i>including jewelry,</i>
<i>watches, paintings, rugs,</i>

20:00.991 --> 20:04.620
silverware, porcelain,
record players, timepieces."

20:04.703 --> 20:07.289
<i>"These were placed on a train to Berlin,</i>

20:07.372 --> 20:09.541
and each family was issued a receipt

20:09.625 --> 20:13.295
under the pretense they would one day
see their belongings returned."

20:13.378 --> 20:15.047
So the train is real.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.173
Of course it's real.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.507
<i> "This never happened,</i>

20:17.591 --> 20:23.472
as the location of the train was lost
after the Nazis surrendered in 1945."

20:23.555 --> 20:26.225
"Many suspect
that soldiers looted the train

20:26.308 --> 20:28.810
and kept some of the items
for themselves."

20:28.894 --> 20:31.855
Can you confirm
that the Vulvokov family's possession--

20:31.939 --> 20:33.941
The Peschauer family, mom's maiden name.

20:34.024 --> 20:38.195
Oh right. Can you confirm
that the Peschauer family's possessions

20:38.278 --> 20:39.613
were put on that train?

20:40.822 --> 20:42.157
I'm sorry,

20:42.241 --> 20:46.411
but that information is not available
to the New York Public Library.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.497
-Shit.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.290
We need to find that train.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.501
Yes, the train and the bugs,
it's all connected.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.045
Find the train, mitigate
the epigenetic k-hole before it begins.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.423
Exactly. I'll get right on it.
It's you and me against the world, baby.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.425
-Who you calling?

21:02.094 --> 21:02.970
<i> Hello?</i>

21:03.053 --> 21:04.638
Hi, Ruthie.
-<i>Nora?</i>

21:04.721 --> 21:08.225
I'm here with my daughter, Nadia,
and she says she sees the bugs too.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.352
You know what that means?
My mom put 'em there.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.521
I got about a dozen of them.
I'll show you.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.231
<i>Are you all right? Your super called Vera.</i>

21:14.314 --> 21:16.024
<i>You're not supposed to be</i>
<i>in your apartment.</i>

21:16.108 --> 21:18.068
<i>They're sending someone from the hospital.</i>

21:18.151 --> 21:20.862
What are you talking about? I'm fine.
I love you, okay? Bye.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.951
We're looking for Nora Vulvokov.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.744
-That's me.
-That's me.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.623
Where are we going?

21:44.553 --> 21:45.387
Great.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.639
Doctor, we're both incredibly busy people,

21:47.723 --> 21:50.017
so, let's not
waste each other's time, huh?

21:50.517 --> 21:53.812
Uh, I'm not the crazy one. She is.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.565
Uh, who's she?

21:57.107 --> 22:00.277
What a prick.
Fuck this guy. He's so disrespectful.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.821
Look, I'm the sane one, man.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.740
Uh, yeah, I always have been.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.868
But to be clear, when I say "sane,"
you know, I mean "eccentric,"

22:07.951 --> 22:09.161
but you know, lucid.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.830
I mean, that's kind of
my defining characteristic, uh--

22:11.913 --> 22:14.374
Ah! Think good cop.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.169
Crazy cop. Yeah?

22:17.252 --> 22:20.255
Will you just fucking tell him I'm right?
Tell him I'm right, Mom.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.592
I'm not getting involved in this.
I don't trust him. We should just get out.

22:23.675 --> 22:28.138
Uh, are your hallucinations visual
or, uh, purely auditory?

22:28.221 --> 22:29.514
None of the above.

22:29.598 --> 22:33.935
Do you think you see your mother right now
or do you just hear her voice?

22:34.019 --> 22:36.063
I don't <i>think</i> I see her.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.397
I see her.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.774
She's right there, man.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.069
Do you think
you see this table before you, Doctor?

22:42.152 --> 22:44.946
I mean, this isn't
some<i> cogito, ergo sum </i>bullshit.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.366
I think, therefore I am seeing my mother.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.368
The thing is, Nora,

22:49.451 --> 22:51.119
there's nobody else in the room.

22:51.703 --> 22:55.082
I mean, it's just you and me.

22:55.916 --> 22:56.792
Uh…

22:57.918 --> 23:00.629
Don't fuck with me, Doctor, all right?

23:01.755 --> 23:02.589
Man,

23:04.216 --> 23:05.384
look behind you.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.804
There's no one there.

23:09.971 --> 23:10.889
Nobody.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.602
There's nobody behind me, Nora.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.816
You're wrong, Doctor.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.027
You have to be.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.987
Ah-ha.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.574
She's right there, you know?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.284
Uh--

23:31.368 --> 23:33.453
Just--

23:33.537 --> 23:34.371
Mom?

23:35.247 --> 23:37.332
Just please say something to him.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.126
They're recording us.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.502
Huh?

23:41.002 --> 23:43.296
Oh. It's good. It's-- It helps.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.965
So look, uh,

23:45.048 --> 23:46.967
I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.136
Uh, I'm Nadia.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.012
Uh, Nora's daughter.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.389
I'm from the future.

23:52.472 --> 23:56.101
You know, I previously thought
that I was just inhabiting her body,

23:56.184 --> 24:00.856
but, uh, I now realize
that I'm inside of her mind too, okay?

24:02.899 --> 24:03.733
Ha.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.279
You know, I'd-- I'd prefer not
to use Thorazine, but, uh,

24:07.362 --> 24:09.614
well, if we need to,
I will.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.033
I see your due day is March 30th.

24:13.034 --> 24:14.578
It's just a few days away.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.831
Now, let's see if we can keep you stable
until the baby comes,

24:17.914 --> 24:19.708
and then we can reevaluate.

24:20.917 --> 24:24.754
Why is it so bad to be
paranoid schizophrenic and have this baby?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.925
Is this what every day
was like for you, Mommy?

24:29.009 --> 24:31.803
I just need
to find a way to fix you.

24:32.762 --> 24:35.098
Nobody understood me until I had you.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.478
You know what?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.733
Nobody's gonna lock us up.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.027
-Nobody.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.452
Ah, let's get the F out of here.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.038
You know, I think if we can just
get back far enough,

24:58.121 --> 25:00.832
we can circumnavigate
this whole future hellscape…

25:02.918 --> 25:05.128
…and then you'll never
have to go through any of this.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.963
My smart baby.

25:07.047 --> 25:11.134
You're gonna do great things, I know it.
Anything you set your mind to, you can do.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.928
Uh, thanks for the pep talk, Mom.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.388
What's going on?
Aren't you gonna come with me?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.849
I can't. Otherwise, who would hold
the other end of the rope?

25:21.478 --> 25:22.938
-Ah!
-Love ya.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.244
"Why aren't you picking up?
