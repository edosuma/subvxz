00:17.953 --> 00:20.183
Frank! What the hell was that thing?

00:20.288 --> 00:22.085
I don't know!

00:22.190 --> 00:23.384
Run!

00:27.662 --> 00:29.220
Chuck! Chuck!

00:37.139 --> 00:38.868
No! No!

00:38.974 --> 00:40.999
Someone help me!

00:43.211 --> 00:44.701
There's something down here!

00:44.813 --> 00:48.374
Get me out! Get me out! Help!

00:48.483 --> 00:49.711
Help me!

01:03.431 --> 01:04.864
Come on!

01:04.965 --> 01:06.524
Come on!

01:32.394 --> 01:34.760
The beast is shrouded. Use the eye.

02:47.669 --> 02:49.034
It has tasted flesh.

02:49.137 --> 02:51.697
We must not let it escape.

02:51.806 --> 02:52.738
Agreed.

02:52.841 --> 02:54.433
I will conceal our efforts.

04:01.710 --> 04:02.802
What the hell?.

04:26.935 --> 04:27.924
Lucy, the legs!

05:00.001 --> 05:03.994
No beast has ever come this close
to the sanctum before.

05:04.105 --> 05:07.302
Mordo, does this not concern you?.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.271
The creature is dead.

05:10.378 --> 05:13.711
I will leave the worrying to you.

05:23.758 --> 05:24.884
What?.

05:38.239 --> 05:39.672
He saw us?.

05:39.774 --> 05:40.706
Yes.

05:40.809 --> 05:41.707
Through your spell?.

05:41.810 --> 05:44.244
It would appear so.

05:59.561 --> 06:01.859
"DOCTOR STRANGE"

07:12.567 --> 07:15.365
Dr. Strange, wait!

07:18.439 --> 07:20.737
Doctor!

07:20.842 --> 07:22.275
Dr. Strange.

07:22.377 --> 07:24.504
Man, it's been chaos,
absolute chaos.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.136
Maybe I should check
your phone battery,

07:26.247 --> 07:27.976
because I left you several-

07:28.082 --> 07:30.312
Well, anyway,
just a couple of patient files to go over.

07:30.418 --> 07:32.113
Five minutes. Tops.

07:32.220 --> 07:33.778
I'm only here for rounds, Cory.

07:35.223 --> 07:37.748
Uh, Miss Latansie, acute aphasia,

07:37.859 --> 07:39.724
migraines, facial nerve paralysis.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.795
Referred by the Third Street
clinic downtown.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.261
Insurance?.

07:43.364 --> 07:45.764
Well, their deductible's
fairly substantial, but-

07:45.867 --> 07:47.425
- Income?.
- Modest.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.832
Okay, low, but-

07:48.937 --> 07:51.269
Cory, you have screened
these cases, haven't you?.

07:51.372 --> 07:52.430
Yes, but-

07:52.540 --> 07:55.134
Would a medical journal
be interested in Miss Latansie?.

07:55.243 --> 07:57.404
- No, but-
- Then neither am I.

08:01.716 --> 08:03.274
You love your job, don't you?.

08:03.384 --> 08:04.976
I'm living the dream.

08:18.099 --> 08:19.964
Stephen, good.

08:20.068 --> 08:22.628
When I saw Cory sulking out there,
I knew you were in.

08:22.737 --> 08:24.136
Oliver.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.296
What an unexpected pleasure.

08:25.406 --> 08:26.873
Please, sit down.

08:26.975 --> 08:27.964
How's the grind?.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.210
Turning me into hamburger.

08:31.312 --> 08:32.370
What can I do to help?.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.970
Seriously?.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.207
Absolutely.

08:35.316 --> 08:37.147
Good, because as you know,

08:37.251 --> 08:38.808
part of my job as administrator

08:38.919 --> 08:41.821
is to keep this hospital
running smoothly.

08:41.923 --> 08:44.323
So it helps if members
of my senior staff

08:44.425 --> 08:48.088
aren't trying to, uh,
strangle one another.

08:48.196 --> 08:49.356
And?.

08:49.464 --> 08:51.398
People want to strangle you, Stephen.

08:51.499 --> 08:53.399
Dr. Atwater for one.

08:53.501 --> 08:55.059
She's been to see me again.

08:55.169 --> 08:58.332
That woman has issues.

08:58.439 --> 08:59.906
Yes, she does.

09:00.008 --> 09:01.373
And they're all with you.

09:01.476 --> 09:06.277
Look, I know you two
have a personal history-

09:06.381 --> 09:08.941
Oliver, that has nothing
to do with this.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.950
Fine.

09:11.052 --> 09:14.453
But she calls you to the coma ward
for consults, you ignore her,

09:14.555 --> 09:16.580
she rattles my cage, I rattle yours-

09:16.691 --> 09:20.787
Please, let's just...
stop the dance, Stephen.

09:22.597 --> 09:25.088
Okay. I promise I'll schedule her in.

09:25.199 --> 09:27.599
She's waiting for you now.

09:27.702 --> 09:29.067
Perfect.

09:46.788 --> 09:48.949
I can't believe it.

09:49.057 --> 09:52.493
The great Dr. Strange
has descended from his lofty tower

09:52.593 --> 09:53.855
to slum in the coma ward.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.156
Don't get used to it.

09:56.264 --> 09:59.859
This hospital didn't hire me
to handle ordinary cases.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.525
I almost forgot how grumpy you get

10:01.636 --> 10:03.763
when you miss your morning
coffee and colonic.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.533
Let me clarify
the economics for you, Gina.

10:06.641 --> 10:09.075
Sensational patients
bring recognition.

10:09.177 --> 10:10.735
Recognition brings money,

10:10.845 --> 10:13.040
and money keeps
Wellhaven's doors open.

10:13.147 --> 10:15.377
You should be thanking me.

10:15.483 --> 10:17.610
Oh, Stephen.

10:17.719 --> 10:19.380
What happened to you?.

10:19.487 --> 10:21.387
Don't you care anymore?.

10:21.489 --> 10:23.957
Caring is not a luxury I can afford.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.117
I get the hopeless cases, remember?.

10:26.227 --> 10:27.785
I know.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.522
That's why I need you.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.827
The patient's name is Camille.

10:32.934 --> 10:34.993
Gina, she's 12.

10:35.103 --> 10:38.095
Yeah, I know you don't treat children,

10:38.206 --> 10:40.868
but this is a special case.

10:40.975 --> 10:44.035
Mrs. Carranza, this is Dr. Strange-

10:44.145 --> 10:45.874
one of the world's
finest neurosurgeons

10:45.980 --> 10:48.244
and a specialist in
aberrant brain maladies.

10:52.553 --> 10:55.454
What symptoms did she present
prior to losing consciousness?.

10:55.556 --> 10:57.046
She had nightmares.

10:57.158 --> 10:59.718
That's unfortunate,
but I'm not a dream-reader.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.317
Stephen, please.

11:01.429 --> 11:04.330
Gina, these are my tools.

11:04.432 --> 11:06.491
She needs a psychoanalyst,
not a surgeon.

11:06.601 --> 11:07.898
It's not just nightmares.

11:08.002 --> 11:09.162
It's her brain.

11:09.270 --> 11:11.830
Look. This was taken seven days ago.

11:11.939 --> 11:12.837
An embolism.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.170
And this was taken this morning.

11:15.276 --> 11:18.006
That's right.
Eight more in one week.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.012
I've never seen anything like this.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.376
Well, I have.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.391
Something's going on in there.

11:50.478 --> 11:51.945
Camille?. Camille.

11:52.046 --> 11:53.035
Can you hear me?.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.911
The nightmares.

11:56.017 --> 11:57.917
What-what did she see?.

11:58.019 --> 11:59.213
What?.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.686
What did she see in her nightmares?.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.756
A face.

12:02.857 --> 12:05.291
She always saw a burning face.

12:06.928 --> 12:08.259
So that's it?.

12:08.362 --> 12:09.886
Children in mysterious comas

12:09.997 --> 12:12.864
don't make the grade
for the great Dr. Strange?.

12:12.967 --> 12:16.869
I am sick of this hospital
feeding your monster ego.

12:16.971 --> 12:19.303
It's time you start giving back.

12:21.609 --> 12:22.598
No! No!

12:25.546 --> 12:26.945
I'm sorry.

12:27.048 --> 12:29.073
I can't help you.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.115
- Oh!
- Sorry.

13:15.563 --> 13:17.292
Lipstick?.

13:17.398 --> 13:19.992
Since when does my
little sister wear lipstick?.

13:20.101 --> 13:22.001
Hey, give it back, moron.

13:22.103 --> 13:24.367
Aw, come on.
I just want to help you.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.531
Get away from me!

13:26.641 --> 13:29.109
Oh, admit it. You look way better.

13:29.210 --> 13:30.336
You are so dead.

13:31.712 --> 13:33.179
Get off of me!

13:33.281 --> 13:35.408
No!

13:40.554 --> 13:42.613
April! You okay?.

13:43.758 --> 13:44.690
April.

14:07.648 --> 14:09.206
In today's top story,

14:09.317 --> 14:11.751
the third tornado this month
strikes the city

14:11.852 --> 14:13.046
in an escalation of violent-

14:21.929 --> 14:23.123
And in other news,

14:23.230 --> 14:25.596
the fate of two city workers
remains a mystery

14:25.700 --> 14:27.099
as an unexplained blast-

15:55.022 --> 15:55.954
Stephen?.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.555
Here. Have some water.

16:01.562 --> 16:02.494
The children-

16:02.596 --> 16:04.029
What?.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.257
The ones in the road.

16:05.366 --> 16:07.334
Did I... hit any of them?.

16:07.435 --> 16:09.869
Stephen, there weren't
any children.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.666
Witnesses say you just lost control.

16:12.773 --> 16:14.536
No, I...

16:14.642 --> 16:16.007
but I saw...

16:16.110 --> 16:18.305
You've been under for three days.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.210
You're just a little confused.

16:21.315 --> 16:23.579
Good news is
you're going to be okay.

16:25.086 --> 16:26.246
Three days?.

16:31.926 --> 16:33.257
Oh, God.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.595
I want to see my chart.

16:38.699 --> 16:39.666
I really think-

16:39.767 --> 16:40.893
Show it to me.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.063
Show it to me now.

17:03.958 --> 17:05.823
Listen, Stephen,

17:05.925 --> 17:08.986
nothing is absolute
in the world of medicine.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.257
You know that.

17:11.365 --> 17:12.923
Save it.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.126
I'll be lucky if can open a door,

17:15.236 --> 17:16.760
let alone hold a scalpel.

17:16.871 --> 17:19.031
You're still a doctor,

17:19.140 --> 17:22.837
and you don't need a scalpel
to heal people.

17:22.943 --> 17:24.934
You think I had this coming,
don't you?.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.876
Stephen, please.

17:26.981 --> 17:27.970
Just go.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.855
Pardon me.

17:56.911 --> 17:59.709
Wonderful to see you again,
Dr. Strange.

18:05.219 --> 18:07.881
Would you like assistance
getting into your residence?.

18:07.988 --> 18:09.387
No.

18:30.344 --> 18:31.402
There you are, sir.

18:31.512 --> 18:33.275
Let me know
if you need anything else.

19:04.745 --> 19:07.373
Oliver, there's got to be someone.

19:07.481 --> 19:10.382
There's always someone
who will take your money, Stephen,

19:10.484 --> 19:14.420
but that doesn't qualify them
to treat your hands.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.886
I'll take that chance!

19:15.990 --> 19:18.720
I don't care how experimental
or how expensive.

19:18.826 --> 19:21.386
I need some options.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.429
Please.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.225
Help me.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.634
All right.

19:28.736 --> 19:30.670
I've heard of a doctor in Berlin.

19:32.273 --> 19:34.002
Why don't you start there?.

19:41.649 --> 19:44.015
The procedure is very expensive.

19:50.057 --> 19:51.888
We can see you six weeks from now.

19:51.992 --> 19:53.892
"NEW STRIDES IN THE FIELD
OF NERVE REATTACHMENT"

20:03.437 --> 20:06.270
Sorry, but the damage is too severe.

20:08.142 --> 20:09.939
There is a specialist:

20:10.044 --> 20:12.535
very good, but very expensive.

20:16.183 --> 20:18.981
I am afraid we can't extend
your bill any further, sir.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.517
We must have
the payment now.

20:25.726 --> 20:29.025
Regrettably, Doctor,
your credit has been declined.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.296
I'm sorry, Stephen,

20:37.404 --> 20:39.668
but Oliver is still unavailable.

20:39.773 --> 20:43.174
I'm sure he'll call you back
the first chance he gets.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.010
There's just nothing we can do.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.382
We've done all we can.

20:54.488 --> 20:55.648
The damage is too severe.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.121
The damage is too severe.
I'm sorry.

20:57.224 --> 20:58.282
You're out of options.

20:58.392 --> 20:59.290
Out of options.

20:59.393 --> 21:00.291
Nothing we can do.

21:00.394 --> 21:01.486
There's nothing we can do.

21:01.595 --> 21:03.062
- Nothing.
- Nothing we can do.

21:03.163 --> 21:04.755
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

21:38.732 --> 21:41.326
What?.

21:41.435 --> 21:43.232
Dr. Strange.

21:43.337 --> 21:45.032
Who's there?.

21:47.608 --> 21:49.576
I am Wong.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.109
How do you know my name?.

21:51.211 --> 21:53.509
I know a great deal about you-

21:53.614 --> 21:55.445
what you have been through

21:55.549 --> 21:59.280
and what you are attempting to do now.

21:59.386 --> 22:02.014
Do not lose hope, Dr. Strange,

22:02.122 --> 22:04.488
for healing awaits you.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.649
Where?.

22:05.759 --> 22:06.817
In Tibet.

22:06.927 --> 22:08.360
Tibet?.

22:08.462 --> 22:10.293
How am I supposed to get there?.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.830
I have nothing.

22:11.932 --> 22:15.060
You have all that is needed,

22:15.169 --> 22:17.330
and this will guide you there.

22:21.909 --> 22:23.843
Why are you helping me?.

22:42.896 --> 22:43.828
Gina.

22:44.998 --> 22:46.465
Wait! Gina.

22:46.567 --> 22:47.693
Don't be frightened.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.736
Stephen?. Are you all right?.

22:50.838 --> 22:52.567
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

22:52.673 --> 22:54.231
I just-

22:54.341 --> 22:55.638
I need your help.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.573
What is it?.

22:57.678 --> 22:59.509
I have to get to Tibet.

22:59.613 --> 23:01.843
Why in the world would you-

23:01.949 --> 23:03.007
Please.

23:03.116 --> 23:04.845
I'm begging you.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.325
Okay.

23:14.428 --> 23:16.157
What do you need?.

24:56.029 --> 24:57.826
I made it.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.024
One journey ends...

25:00.133 --> 25:03.261
as another begins.

25:09.309 --> 25:12.005
This way. It is not much further.

25:12.112 --> 25:14.205
Where are we going?.

25:14.314 --> 25:16.874
All questions will
be answered shortly.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.254
Do as I do.

25:27.361 --> 25:28.885
Who is this?.

25:30.097 --> 25:31.997
The Ancient One.

25:40.073 --> 25:41.734
How long must I wait?.

25:41.842 --> 25:43.275
Be patient.

25:43.377 --> 25:48.178
An audience with the sorcerer supreme
is an honor that cannot be rushed.

25:48.281 --> 25:49.714
Please.

25:51.118 --> 25:52.278
I've come so far.

25:52.386 --> 25:53.614
Step back.

25:56.156 --> 25:58.920
All I want is the cure
I was promised.

25:59.026 --> 26:02.689
You can only heal
the wounds of the flesh

26:02.796 --> 26:05.993
once you have healed
the wounds of the soul.

26:06.099 --> 26:07.726
Spiritual guidance?.

26:09.369 --> 26:11.803
That's what you're offering?.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.806
But he told me
you could fix my hands.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.637
I cannot.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.075
For the cure you seek is within you.

26:19.179 --> 26:20.612
I don't understand.

26:20.714 --> 26:25.083
Then you have made this journey in vain.

26:29.690 --> 26:30.588
Wait!

26:33.293 --> 26:35.989
Please...

26:36.096 --> 26:37.927
I've tried everything.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.397
No. You have not.

26:40.500 --> 26:44.197
The question is, are you willing to?.

26:44.304 --> 26:45.635
Yes.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.871
Then you may stay.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.036
Thank you.

26:53.146 --> 26:54.170
Come.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.290
But where am I
supposed to sleep?.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.432
Here.

27:14.534 --> 27:16.263
On the floor?.

27:16.369 --> 27:20.203
Comfort is a privilege,
one that is earned.

27:22.776 --> 27:24.937
You start work in the morning.

27:28.715 --> 27:29.943
You look nervous.

27:30.050 --> 27:32.678
I have never faced
these creatures before.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.014
Well, relax.

27:34.121 --> 27:35.816
Shadowhounds are nothing.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.116
I've killed dozens of 'em.

27:37.224 --> 27:38.282
What has happened?.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.518
Shadowhounds.

27:40.627 --> 27:41.685
I will accompany you.

27:41.795 --> 27:45.128
Oh?. And what of your duties
as nursemaid?.

27:45.232 --> 27:48.360
Even when I was
your nursemaid, Mordo,

27:48.468 --> 27:51.665
I still accomplished
all that was required of me.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.018
Stay in the light.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.056
That is where they are most vulnerable.

28:11.158 --> 28:13.558
I do not see them.

28:13.660 --> 28:17.221
They hunt in shadow
and in great numbers.

28:17.330 --> 28:18.820
How do we lure them out?.

28:18.932 --> 28:21.230
We already have.

28:31.745 --> 28:33.303
Spread out!

28:37.784 --> 28:39.411
Adena!

29:33.940 --> 29:35.737
Where are you?.

29:35.842 --> 29:38.106
Show yourselves, you vermin!

29:39.145 --> 29:41.136
Oh, there you are.

29:41.248 --> 29:42.715
Come on, then!

29:50.323 --> 29:52.484
what are they doing?.

29:52.592 --> 29:53.786
Gathering.

29:53.894 --> 29:55.623
And so we wait.

29:55.729 --> 29:59.165
When we can smell their breath,
only then do we strike.

30:00.600 --> 30:01.999
Prepare yourselves.

30:13.146 --> 30:15.114
Hello?.

30:15.215 --> 30:16.512
Wong?.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.042
Excuse me.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.210
I, uh-

30:20.320 --> 30:22.049
I was told to begin work
this morning.

30:22.155 --> 30:24.555
Then you may begin.

30:24.658 --> 30:26.717
You want me to scrub the floor?.

30:26.826 --> 30:30.990
I would do it, but I am an old man.

30:31.097 --> 30:33.088
I don't understand.

30:33.199 --> 30:36.532
How am I supposed
to hold the brushes?.

30:36.636 --> 30:40.697
That is between you
and the brushes.

30:57.991 --> 30:59.856
Where are the others?.

30:59.960 --> 31:04.454
They fought bravely,
but were lost, Ancient One.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.101
the creatures move
with increasing confidence.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.865
They seek their master,

31:12.973 --> 31:17.000
and Dormammu's influence
grows stronger by the day.

31:17.110 --> 31:18.634
How is that possible?.

31:18.745 --> 31:20.770
I have seen the gateway.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.041
The dark dimension remains sealed.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.310
Dormammu has not come through.

31:25.418 --> 31:30.856
Yes, but I fear
he knows something we do not.

32:13.033 --> 32:14.261
- Doctor-
- Please.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.732
She will not survive without surgery.

32:15.835 --> 32:18.827
And there's little hope
that she'll survive with it.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.667
Let me tell you something.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.901
Hope is the only thing
keeping her together.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.341
I'm not letting you take that away.

32:26.746 --> 32:27.838
What'd he say?.

32:27.947 --> 32:29.209
Forget him.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.249
He's not the right doctor for you.

32:31.351 --> 32:33.819
You've said that about the last three.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.547
Listen to me, April.

32:36.589 --> 32:38.284
We're gonna wait six months.

32:38.391 --> 32:41.519
By then, I'll be your doctor,

32:41.628 --> 32:43.755
and we'll deal with this once and for all.

32:43.863 --> 32:46.195
You're gonna be my doctor?.

32:46.299 --> 32:47.732
Oh, man.

32:47.834 --> 32:50.234
Now I'm really in trouble.

32:51.738 --> 32:54.036
Wait until you get my bill.

34:08.348 --> 34:13.012
Look, I don't know why you think
this is helping me,

34:13.119 --> 34:14.916
because it isn't!

34:15.021 --> 34:18.353
My hands... are getting worse!

34:18.458 --> 34:21.484
They should not be
the measure of your progress.

34:21.594 --> 34:22.925
What is, then?.

34:23.029 --> 34:24.223
It isn't the wall.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.956
You guys keep rebuilding it.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.556
Just tell me.

34:28.668 --> 34:31.398
When can I use these again?.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.063
This is not about your hands.

34:34.174 --> 34:35.402
It never has been.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.100
Listen to me.

34:37.210 --> 34:38.507
I am a doctor!

34:38.610 --> 34:40.078
I need my hands!

34:40.179 --> 34:42.705
No. You do not.

34:48.721 --> 34:51.246
Then there's no reason
for me to be here.

34:55.395 --> 34:57.090
Let him go.

34:57.197 --> 35:01.258
But, Ancient One, he will not survive.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.597
That is his choice.

35:03.703 --> 35:09.335
In the end, he must find
his own way back.

35:49.015 --> 35:50.277
Okay, April,

35:50.383 --> 35:52.510
You should be feeling
a little more relaxed.

35:52.619 --> 35:54.280
I'm not scared.

35:54.387 --> 35:55.547
And you shouldn't be.

35:55.655 --> 35:57.282
Because I'm gonna
take care of you.

35:57.390 --> 35:59.620
How do I look?.

35:59.726 --> 36:02.126
You could use some more lipstick.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.530
Okay, we're ready.

36:05.632 --> 36:07.031
Now, when you wake up,

36:07.133 --> 36:09.601
you'll feel a little groggy,

36:09.702 --> 36:12.466
but you'll be all better.

36:14.974 --> 36:16.464
I am scared.

36:16.576 --> 36:19.044
April, you're gonna be fine.

36:19.145 --> 36:20.737
I promise.

36:44.270 --> 36:47.171
No!

36:54.814 --> 36:56.042
Love...

36:56.149 --> 36:57.411
loss...

36:57.517 --> 36:59.951
pain.

37:00.053 --> 37:05.013
They are stones in the wall
that block your path, Stephen.

37:05.124 --> 37:08.218
What- Are you-

37:08.328 --> 37:10.353
Are you really here?.

37:10.463 --> 37:13.227
See the wall for what it is,

37:13.333 --> 37:15.699
and then tear it down,

37:15.802 --> 37:17.702
for the truth is waiting.

37:17.804 --> 37:18.702
What truth?.

37:18.805 --> 37:22.206
That your sister
could not be saved.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.866
How can you say that?.

37:23.976 --> 37:25.773
She died on my table.

37:25.878 --> 37:26.970
She trusted me!

37:29.482 --> 37:32.940
you are a natural healer, Stephen,

37:33.052 --> 37:36.783
but not all lives
are destined to be saved.

37:36.889 --> 37:39.949
It was out of your hands.

37:40.059 --> 37:41.526
I don't believe that.

37:41.627 --> 37:45.620
And that is what has
chained you to this place.

37:45.732 --> 37:48.098
Accept the truth...

37:48.201 --> 37:50.761
and break free.

37:50.870 --> 37:54.271
You stand at the foot of the wall.

37:54.374 --> 37:56.501
What is your next move?.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.559
You helped him?.

38:21.701 --> 38:24.033
Just a little.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.975
He is ready.

39:07.079 --> 39:09.547
Master, what is it?. What do you see?.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.931
Chinou... two of them.

39:37.043 --> 39:39.841
They advance on the sanctum.

39:42.515 --> 39:45.609
They will attack
from opposite sides.

39:45.718 --> 39:46.980
I will assemble teams.

39:47.086 --> 39:48.246
No, Mordo.

39:48.354 --> 39:51.846
It will take all of you
to stop even one.

39:51.958 --> 39:54.119
Begin with the nearest threat,

39:54.227 --> 39:56.957
and then on to the next.

39:57.063 --> 39:59.156
But, Master, I believe
we are strong enough

39:59.265 --> 40:01.096
to engage them on both fronts.

40:01.200 --> 40:07.139
Believe what you will,
but do as you are commanded.

40:12.645 --> 40:16.741
From here, we divide
into two teams.

40:36.102 --> 40:37.967
Stephen.

40:39.405 --> 40:42.568
Not quitting. Just resting.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.978
This gets more difficult
every day.

40:47.079 --> 40:49.980
Only as difficult as you allow.

40:51.250 --> 40:55.346
I'd say gravity and solid mass
have a little something to say about it, too.

40:55.454 --> 40:58.890
You perceive these stones to be heavy.

40:58.991 --> 41:00.583
Therefore, they are.

41:00.693 --> 41:03.355
But to the chosen few...

41:05.698 --> 41:07.666
weight is meaningless.

41:07.767 --> 41:10.531
How do you do these things?.

41:10.636 --> 41:14.367
By learning to accept
the unacceptable.

41:14.473 --> 41:18.204
Pull the rope again,
and I will assist.

41:26.118 --> 41:27.585
Hey!

41:27.687 --> 41:30.087
You perceived
it was without weight,

41:30.189 --> 41:33.181
so it became weightless.

41:33.292 --> 41:35.886
Matter is energy
which is all around us.

41:35.995 --> 41:40.329
Sorcery is simply the art
of wielding that energy.

41:40.433 --> 41:42.901
A weapon forged from air?.

41:44.203 --> 41:47.104
Tell me, is it real?.

41:48.140 --> 41:49.607
Doesn't look like it.

42:07.093 --> 42:11.621
this time, you believed it was real.

42:11.731 --> 42:15.064
Control the forces
around your hands,

42:15.167 --> 42:17.795
and limitations become irrelevant.

42:22.742 --> 42:25.836
What happened to the wall?.

42:25.945 --> 42:29.437
You perceived it,
so it was there.

42:29.548 --> 42:32.915
But now you have accepted
the unacceptable,

42:33.019 --> 42:36.147
and the wall
no longer blocks your path.

42:36.255 --> 42:41.318
It is time you see what lies beyond.

43:22.134 --> 43:23.567
Blue! Demara!

43:23.669 --> 43:25.660
Throw up a containment spell!

43:35.281 --> 43:37.442
Mordo, their spell will not stop it!

43:37.550 --> 43:39.541
Tell them to move out of the way!

43:39.652 --> 43:41.313
No! It will hold!

45:08.407 --> 45:09.499
I've got you.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.478
Are you all right?.

45:24.256 --> 45:25.689
I'll be fine.

45:29.628 --> 45:32.597
so many innocent lives,

45:32.698 --> 45:35.258
and four of our own.

45:35.367 --> 45:38.859
Our brothers, our sisters...

45:38.971 --> 45:42.702
their bodies lie at your feet, Mordo!

45:42.808 --> 45:44.673
We were victorious.

45:44.777 --> 45:47.405
The chinou was slain,
and the sanctum was defended.

45:47.513 --> 45:48.707
I regret nothing.

45:54.086 --> 45:58.147
You have lost sight
of our purpose, Mordo.

45:58.257 --> 46:01.021
You focus only on the battle.

46:01.126 --> 46:04.857
But we are protectors,
not warriors.

46:04.964 --> 46:06.864
Yet we fight a war,

46:06.966 --> 46:09.366
so perhaps a warrior
should take the lead.

46:09.468 --> 46:10.594
Mordo!

46:12.071 --> 46:15.199
You feel I should step down, Mordo.

46:15.307 --> 46:16.535
You are ill.

46:16.642 --> 46:18.473
Your time draws near.

46:18.577 --> 46:20.442
I believe Dormammu
knows this,

46:20.546 --> 46:22.844
and it's the reason
he is making his move now.

46:22.948 --> 46:25.746
You may be correct,

46:25.851 --> 46:28.843
but the position
of sorcerer supreme

46:28.954 --> 46:32.151
was never destined to be yours.

46:32.258 --> 46:35.591
If that was ever in question,

46:35.694 --> 46:39.721
your recent actions
have proven this point!

46:39.832 --> 46:42.232
You would offer it
to someone else?.

46:42.334 --> 46:44.825
Who?. I deserve to know.

46:44.937 --> 46:47.599
One who does not seek it.

46:47.706 --> 46:49.537
So then what is my role here?.

46:49.642 --> 46:51.633
To train him.

46:56.282 --> 46:58.182
As commanded.

47:07.860 --> 47:12.661
I am sorry for my part
in what has happened, Master.

47:12.765 --> 47:16.565
You were misled, my son.

47:16.669 --> 47:22.471
As for Mordo,
I fear he must be watched.

47:54.773 --> 47:58.675
Have you ever held a blade in your life?.

47:58.777 --> 48:01.268
To save lives, yes,

48:01.380 --> 48:03.541
but not to take them.

48:45.891 --> 48:48.359
I'm sorry, Mordo.

48:48.460 --> 48:49.893
I didn't mean to-

48:49.995 --> 48:51.622
You insect!

49:02.808 --> 49:03.900
That's quite enough, Mordo.

49:10.682 --> 49:12.582
Why do you interfere?.

49:12.684 --> 49:16.552
You are here to train him,
not kill him.

49:19.958 --> 49:23.416
What good is a sorcerer supreme
who cannot defend himself?.

49:23.529 --> 49:25.554
What did he mean by that?.

49:25.664 --> 49:27.928
Unimportant for now.

49:28.033 --> 49:31.764
What is important
is what you have just accomplished.

49:31.870 --> 49:34.600
Which is what, making him mad?.

49:34.706 --> 49:37.266
No. That is easy.

49:37.376 --> 49:42.075
What is difficult is your ability
to absorb Mordo's magic

49:42.181 --> 49:44.672
and then turn it against him-

49:44.783 --> 49:48.082
a unique gift granted to very few.

49:48.187 --> 49:50.417
Mordo obviously didn't appreciate it.

49:50.522 --> 49:55.016
Which is why I will be taking over
your training.

49:55.127 --> 49:56.958
No argument from me.

51:16.842 --> 51:19.436
Wong, what's going on?.

51:19.545 --> 51:21.274
The Ancient One will explain

51:21.380 --> 51:22.779
when we reach the city.

51:22.881 --> 51:25.611
The city?.

51:25.717 --> 51:27.810
But how are we going to get there?.

51:40.566 --> 51:41.794
What just happened?.

51:41.900 --> 51:44.528
We're here. That's all it takes.

51:44.636 --> 51:46.729
You had me trek
all the way to Tibet

51:46.838 --> 51:48.863
when you had a back door
the whole time?.

51:48.974 --> 51:50.999
You could not have gone
this way until now.

51:51.109 --> 51:53.168
Come. There is more to see.

51:57.616 --> 52:00.483
The space we occupy here on Earth

52:00.586 --> 52:02.713
is shared by many others-

52:02.821 --> 52:04.812
entire worlds.

52:04.923 --> 52:06.754
We are not aware of them,

52:06.858 --> 52:10.487
for they exist
in separate dimensions.

52:10.596 --> 52:12.257
However...

52:12.364 --> 52:14.832
each dimension has a gateway,

52:14.933 --> 52:18.494
one that leads only to this place:

52:18.604 --> 52:22.472
the sanctum sanctorum.

52:29.081 --> 52:32.949
It is called the nexus...

52:33.051 --> 52:37.545
the center of all other dimensions.

52:37.656 --> 52:39.351
As sorcerers,

52:39.458 --> 52:42.450
it has become our duty
to defend it.

52:42.561 --> 52:43.755
From what?.

52:43.862 --> 52:45.853
Dormammu.

52:58.277 --> 53:01.440
He consists of corrupted magic,

53:01.546 --> 53:04.413
and dwells in the dark dimension,

53:04.516 --> 53:09.112
a world consumed
by his brutal appetite.

53:11.757 --> 53:15.693
Dormammu crossed over long ago
with a legion of creatures,

53:15.794 --> 53:18.058
and seized the nexus.

53:18.163 --> 53:21.564
This gave him control
over all other dimensions.

53:21.667 --> 53:23.066
But you stopped him.

53:23.168 --> 53:26.296
Not us- the Ancient One.

53:26.405 --> 53:29.340
He drove Dormammu
back into his own world

53:29.441 --> 53:31.204
and sealed the gateway.

53:31.310 --> 53:32.709
And his creatures?.

53:32.811 --> 53:35.871
We have slain all but one.

53:37.082 --> 53:38.140
The wing mark.

53:38.250 --> 53:43.552
It will only awaken on the day
of its master's return.

53:43.655 --> 53:44.747
Where is it now?.

53:46.158 --> 53:48.558
On its way to the city.

53:48.660 --> 53:50.355
But you're pretty confident

53:50.462 --> 53:52.896
Dormammu can't break
through this, right?.

53:52.998 --> 53:54.295
He cannot,

53:54.399 --> 53:58.859
but his influence on the creatures
is unmistakable.

53:58.970 --> 54:02.201
He is coming... somehow.

54:37.409 --> 54:38.671
Do you feel it?.

54:38.777 --> 54:41.245
Step away from the nexus,
Stephen.

54:41.346 --> 54:43.314
But if he answers here, then we-

54:48.520 --> 54:49.578
What was that?.

54:49.688 --> 54:51.087
Dormammu.

54:51.189 --> 54:54.386
I've seen that face before.

54:54.493 --> 54:55.482
You what?.

54:55.594 --> 54:56.583
Where?.

54:56.695 --> 55:01.029
In the hospital
when I examined a child.

55:01.133 --> 55:05.502
She was in a coma,
and I saw what she saw.

55:05.604 --> 55:06.662
A child?.

55:06.772 --> 55:10.139
Yes, but she wasn't the only one.

55:10.242 --> 55:11.607
There were many,

55:11.710 --> 55:14.110
all having nightmares
of that same face.

55:14.212 --> 55:15.611
Yes.

55:15.714 --> 55:17.341
The answer is there.

55:17.449 --> 55:21.818
In dreams, the pure mind of a child
can sometimes see

55:21.920 --> 55:24.218
through the veil
of other dimensions.

55:24.322 --> 55:29.385
Dormammu has found a way
to reach through that veil.

55:29.494 --> 55:32.725
But, Ancient One,
what does this mean?.

55:32.831 --> 55:35.425
If enough veils are passed,

55:35.534 --> 55:37.900
it is a way into our world:

55:38.003 --> 55:39.664
through the windows of the mind.

55:39.771 --> 55:41.102
We have but one option:

55:41.206 --> 55:44.607
kill the children before
he can come through.

55:44.709 --> 55:46.267
No, Mordo.

55:46.378 --> 55:48.312
That is never an option.

55:48.413 --> 55:49.311
Wait.

55:49.414 --> 55:52.577
If I could wake them up,
what would happen then?.

55:52.684 --> 55:56.848
The windows of the mind
would close.

55:56.955 --> 56:00.220
Go. Try.

56:00.325 --> 56:03.658
We will remain behind
to defend the sanctum.

56:06.164 --> 56:10.294
I will go with him
in case a warrior is needed.

56:10.402 --> 56:12.131
Here.

56:12.237 --> 56:14.967
I have something for you.

56:22.948 --> 56:24.540
Stephen?.

56:30.422 --> 56:32.413
The number of patients has tripled.

56:32.524 --> 56:33.616
What are you doing?.

56:33.725 --> 56:35.215
Checking other hospitals.

56:35.327 --> 56:37.318
I want to see how widespread this is.

56:39.798 --> 56:43.666
Every coma ward,
they're filled to capacity.

57:07.492 --> 57:09.722
It's okay, Camille.

57:09.828 --> 57:11.386
It's over.

57:40.358 --> 57:42.724
The wing mark.

57:42.827 --> 57:44.226
It is here.

57:55.974 --> 57:57.532
You're safe now.

58:09.621 --> 58:13.887
You dare enter my realm?.

58:13.992 --> 58:16.688
I come to offer my help.

58:18.229 --> 58:21.198
Why turn away
from the Ancient One?.

58:21.299 --> 58:25.235
Because the Ancient One
has turned away from me.

58:26.471 --> 58:31.374
I could imprison you here...
like the children.

58:31.476 --> 58:34.809
Then Dr. Strange
would then release me,

58:34.913 --> 58:36.642
like the children.

58:37.849 --> 58:42.115
And what is it you offer?.

59:34.773 --> 59:36.741
Mordo! Something's wrong.

59:36.841 --> 59:39.833
I think Dormammu
is making his move.

59:45.183 --> 59:47.981
Mordo! We have to-

01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:12.936
Are you injured?.

01:00:13.044 --> 01:00:14.807
I'm okay.

01:00:14.913 --> 01:00:15.902
What happened to Mordo?.

01:00:16.014 --> 01:00:17.948
He has joined Dormammu.

01:00:57.122 --> 01:01:00.956
Miro! Adena!
The creature is upon us!

01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:02.959
Prepare yourselves.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.850
Adena, home.

01:02:10.962 --> 01:02:12.862
Retreat to safety.

01:02:12.964 --> 01:02:15.831
No. I will not leave you, Master.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:51.901
I see you have found
your true place, Mordo-

01:02:52.003 --> 01:02:55.461
as the lap dog of Dormammu.

01:03:07.652 --> 01:03:09.813
Master!

01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:16.390
No.

01:03:16.494 --> 01:03:18.291
No!

01:03:18.396 --> 01:03:20.830
Not my master.

01:03:30.408 --> 01:03:34.310
Wong, we have to find Mordo.

01:03:34.412 --> 01:03:40.351
You will need the Eye... of Agamotto
to find him and his master.

01:03:42.053 --> 01:03:44.851
But that belongs
to the sorcerer supreme.

01:03:44.956 --> 01:03:46.583
Exactly.

01:03:46.691 --> 01:03:50.388
And with it, you can unlock the power
that dwells deep within you.

01:03:53.231 --> 01:03:56.029
No. Not me.

01:03:56.134 --> 01:03:57.362
I don't want it.

01:03:57.468 --> 01:04:00.835
Which is why it is your destiny.

01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:50.280
So the torch has been passed.

01:04:50.388 --> 01:04:54.085
And now it will be extinguished!

01:04:56.894 --> 01:05:00.057
Not before the Ancient One is avenged.

01:05:50.548 --> 01:05:51.572
Wong!

01:06:05.496 --> 01:06:08.590
Bow to the true master, Strange.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:10.690
My master is dead.

01:06:10.802 --> 01:06:13.862
And you will soon follow.

01:06:59.584 --> 01:07:01.779
You have failed me.

01:07:27.945 --> 01:07:28.843
Wong!

01:07:28.946 --> 01:07:30.140
Go, Stephen.

01:07:30.248 --> 01:07:31.977
You are all that is left.

01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:34.551
Dormammu must be stopped!

01:07:51.169 --> 01:07:56.129
Come! The gateway is now open.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.333
Spread into the night.

01:07:58.442 --> 01:08:01.343
Feast! Multiply!

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:06.075
For this world is ours!

01:08:09.187 --> 01:08:11.280
Who are you?.

01:08:11.389 --> 01:08:12.947
I'm Dr. Strange,

01:08:13.057 --> 01:08:15.890
sorcerer supreme!

01:08:43.054 --> 01:08:48.390
You are a child fighting a god!

01:08:51.996 --> 01:08:54.395
Yes!

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:46.274
Stephen, listen to me.

01:09:46.384 --> 01:09:49.716
Dormammu is a creature
of pure magic.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:50.946
Use that against him!

01:09:51.055 --> 01:09:55.151
Pure magic. Pure magic!

01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:01.164
You wield the power of a god?.

01:10:01.265 --> 01:10:03.256
Then give it to me-all of it!

01:10:06.337 --> 01:10:10.797
No! It's not possible!

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:09.724
Well, that is not what I meant,

01:11:09.834 --> 01:11:11.961
but nice work, Stephen.

01:11:13.871 --> 01:11:15.168
The creatures.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:16.899
They're still out there.

01:11:17.007 --> 01:11:20.875
And we will have long days ahead.

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:34.452
Stephen?.

01:11:38.362 --> 01:11:40.694
You look-

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:42.231
You look great.

01:11:43.401 --> 01:11:45.028
Things have changed for me.

01:11:45.136 --> 01:11:47.570
I'm so glad.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:49.935
But how did you know I was here?.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.372
You always come here, Gina.

01:11:52.476 --> 01:11:54.341
Wait. Your hand.

01:11:54.445 --> 01:11:56.037
It's healed. How did it-

01:11:56.147 --> 01:11:57.774
It's a long story.

01:11:57.882 --> 01:12:01.818
But I want you to know
that you were right.

01:12:01.919 --> 01:12:04.251
It is time I start giving back.

01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:06.414
I don't understand.

01:12:06.524 --> 01:12:08.719
You will.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.250
Stephen?.

01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:33.282
Are you all right?.

01:12:34.485 --> 01:12:35.975
Yes.

01:12:36.086 --> 01:12:37.280
I am.

01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:44.092
How's the scouting been going?.

01:12:44.195 --> 01:12:46.561
Very good.

01:12:46.664 --> 01:12:49.292
I have discovered
several new prospects-

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.096
young, but very promising.

01:12:52.203 --> 01:12:54.364
One in particular-

01:12:54.472 --> 01:12:56.940
a woman named Clea.
