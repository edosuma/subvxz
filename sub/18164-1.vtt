02:42.287 --> 02:46.251
All righty. Two matzo
balls just like you like it.

02:46.351 --> 02:48.684
Always taking care of me. You.

02:48.784 --> 02:51.179
Hey, anything for my most
beautiful customer, huh?

02:52.335 --> 02:54.444
I left you a nice tip today.

02:54.544 --> 02:59.083
Oh, Leo, you don't have to do that.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

02:59.183 --> 03:00.427
My pleasure.

03:00.527 --> 03:03.211
- See you later, buddy.
- Thank you.

03:03.311 --> 03:05.202
Hold on one second.

03:05.503 --> 03:07.393
- Excuse me.
- One sec.

03:09.808 --> 03:11.851
You know, aluminum
is not good for you.

03:11.951 --> 03:14.027
Waiter? Hey, excuse me, buddy.

03:14.127 --> 03:18.348
- Is there something wrong with my fork?
- No, just your stock choice's future.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.995
Oh. Well, your future involves
topping off my coffee, okay?

03:24.623 --> 03:27.371
Aluminum's stable. There's just
no growth potential in it.

03:27.471 --> 03:30.137
Wait, wait! Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on. Back it up.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.627
Unbelievable.

03:31.727 --> 03:34.091
That is exactly what my
consultant said last night.

03:34.191 --> 03:37.342
And I bet he charged you more than
the $6.95 lunch special for that.

03:37.839 --> 03:39.458
Yeah, he did.

03:42.175 --> 03:46.763
Okay. So, say you were her.
What would you bet on?

03:46.863 --> 03:49.246
I would go with...

03:52.335 --> 03:53.579
That one.

03:54.279 --> 03:56.939
You're kidding, right?
That's nickel stuff.

03:57.039 --> 03:58.597
Simitek's about to shake
hands with them next week.

03:58.698 --> 04:00.940
That means, by Friday, those nickels
are gonna be worth millions.

04:01.699 --> 04:05.987
- Wow. That's impressive.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

04:06.087 --> 04:08.651
Mike, table 57 is yours.
They need something. Go.

04:08.751 --> 04:12.592
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second. So...

04:12.879 --> 04:15.147
What are you doing later tonight?

04:15.247 --> 04:17.964
Maybe you want to show me
something I haven't seen yet.

04:18.064 --> 04:20.235
Wow! Ha! Okay.

04:20.334 --> 04:24.459
I think I will be at home...
with my girlfriend...

04:24.559 --> 04:25.771
Oh.

04:25.871 --> 04:27.851
...my very jealous, very...

04:27.951 --> 04:30.431
- Hey, waiter dude.
- Yeah, casanova.

04:30.531 --> 04:31.759
- It's "Mike"!
- Mike.

04:31.859 --> 04:35.847
- Mike Christian, and he's very religious.
- Yeah, well, I'd pray to that.

04:36.879 --> 04:38.923
And very busy, okay?
Still waiterless.

04:39.023 --> 04:40.556
- Going, going, going.
- Wait, Mike.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.859
- This is ridiculous.
- Unreal.

04:42.959 --> 04:44.939
- No, no, no. Sir, I apologize.
- No, no, no.

04:45.039 --> 04:46.060
No, I'm sorry.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.755
I don't want your apology.
We have a business meeting.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.052
- He's just a trainee, please.
- I'll say he's a trainee.

04:50.152 --> 04:52.056
Please, let me take
your order. Gentlemen...

04:52.156 --> 04:54.083
A trainee, really.

04:55.315 --> 04:58.583
You know what? I don't feel
so good. I think I got to go.

04:58.683 --> 05:00.720
If you dare take that tie off,
you're fired, okay?

05:00.820 --> 05:04.715
- Keep it on and clean the table!
- What seems to be the problem?

05:04.815 --> 05:06.828
He wants to get fired, Mr. Lipnick.

05:06.928 --> 05:09.308
He's already chased out four
of our regular customers.

05:09.408 --> 05:12.181
I know... four coffee-only customers.

05:12.282 --> 05:17.771
Those people have been hogging
that table every day now for a week.

05:17.871 --> 05:20.587
I wondered who had the
balls to throw them out.

05:20.687 --> 05:23.115
Good business sense, Michael.
You're my man.

05:23.215 --> 05:24.855
Thank you.

05:26.287 --> 05:27.455
Come here. Let's talk.

05:27.555 --> 05:32.063
Michael, my granddaughter Delilah
is at a conference at university hall.

05:32.164 --> 05:34.142
Do you think you could
pick her up for us?

05:34.351 --> 05:35.691
Absolutely.

05:39.767 --> 05:43.147
Although it's rare, at the
turn of the last century,

05:43.247 --> 05:47.211
the divorce rate grew for a
number of justifiable reasons.

05:47.311 --> 05:50.227
People are alcoholics, drug addicts,

05:50.328 --> 05:53.112
physically abusive to their
spouse or children...

05:53.213 --> 05:58.155
these are situations where separation
is often best for all involved.

05:58.455 --> 06:04.611
But divorce and its acceptance
have changed with the times.

06:05.111 --> 06:09.067
On their wedding day,
couples often still say,

06:09.167 --> 06:13.593
"till death do us part,"
but after time passes,

06:13.694 --> 06:16.300
the initial attraction often fades.

06:16.601 --> 06:22.443
The perfect spouse all of a sudden
is a normal person with human flaws.

06:22.743 --> 06:26.522
Recurring arguments,
attraction to a co-worker,

06:26.623 --> 06:32.252
or simple boredom can lead
to irreconcilable differences.

06:32.943 --> 06:35.595
Divorce is a lazy way out.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.275
Divorce is a shortcut solution.

06:39.375 --> 06:42.315
Wake up, grandma.
It's the 21st century.

06:42.415 --> 06:43.715
That's the way it goes.

06:45.443 --> 06:50.079
What about children?
Doesn't our future depend on them?

06:52.687 --> 06:56.860
Divorce can have a devastating effect
on a child, as my case studies attest.

06:58.447 --> 07:03.889
I can also personally attest to this
because I come from a broken family.

07:04.190 --> 07:08.113
I was raised by my grandparents,
and not that they didn't take care of me,

07:08.214 --> 07:13.583
because they did, but I still wish
that my parents were there, too.

07:13.983 --> 07:15.903
And your solution?

07:19.867 --> 07:24.139
Take it seriously. Marriage is work.

07:24.239 --> 07:27.670
Marriage is for life. If you are
willing to make the commitment,

07:27.771 --> 07:30.455
you have to be prepared
to go the distance.

07:30.555 --> 07:35.454
Excuse me. Did you major in
sociology or did you major in fantasy?

07:39.079 --> 07:42.347
You make it sound like a jail
sentence without the parole.

07:44.735 --> 07:47.612
Look, buddy, no need to worry.
From the looks of it,

07:47.713 --> 07:50.699
the only lifelong commitment you'll
have is with your right hand.

07:55.791 --> 07:57.180
Shit.

07:58.839 --> 08:02.843
Thank you. That's... that's it.

08:02.943 --> 08:04.665
That's all.

08:05.263 --> 08:06.384
Thank god.

08:16.319 --> 08:17.707
Honey, slow down.

08:17.807 --> 08:20.155
I worked my butt off for
three years on that thesis.

08:20.255 --> 08:22.063
I interviewed hundreds of couples,

08:22.164 --> 08:24.440
and all it takes is a couple
of idiots in the audience

08:24.541 --> 08:26.499
to make it all seem like a joke!

08:27.199 --> 08:29.290
And you seem to have
no opinion about it.

08:29.390 --> 08:32.825
Well, if it's one thing I've learned from
you, it's when to keep my mouth shut.

08:33.582 --> 08:37.719
Okay, then. Fine. Let's...
let's be honest.

08:37.881 --> 08:39.668
I can handle it.

08:40.619 --> 08:42.323
Tell me the truth.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.350
- The truth?
- Yeah.

08:47.022 --> 08:50.566
Well, I think some of
those guys had some...

08:51.919 --> 08:53.903
Pretty valid points.

08:56.270 --> 09:00.673
Why don't you just admit it?
You don't respect my academic research!

09:04.551 --> 09:08.769
No! It's just thousands of theses
sit in a library gathering dust.

09:08.870 --> 09:13.275
You know, they change nothing. The world
goes on as if they were never even written.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.183
Yeah, but out of those thousands,

09:15.284 --> 09:18.819
one of those papers had the
formula for electricity on it.

09:19.599 --> 09:20.778
It did?

09:20.878 --> 09:23.179
So how do you know that
mine won't be that one?

09:23.279 --> 09:26.734
I mean, if it could just change
one mind, it would all be worth it.

09:27.035 --> 09:29.091
Why am I wasting my
time talking to you?

09:29.191 --> 09:32.106
What would a college dropout
care about this stuff anyway?

09:32.206 --> 09:36.190
Hey, I am a proud dropout, okay?
College is a waste of time.

09:36.290 --> 09:41.208
Four, five, six years of endless
side roads and pointless detours.

09:41.309 --> 09:44.802
My theory for life is
simple... shortcuts.

09:45.935 --> 09:47.325
Shortcuts.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.735
You know what? This has been too
much academic debate for one day.

10:03.943 --> 10:07.318
I'm sorry, Mike, okay?
I just had a really rough day.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.990
How about some margaritas
at the deck bar?

10:15.759 --> 10:20.020
And then how about a massage

10:20.121 --> 10:24.452
by the expert hands of
a Kansas City farm boy?

10:26.683 --> 10:28.195
If the client is not
completely satisfied,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.397
she can return the
massage to the massager.

10:32.463 --> 10:33.820
Thank god.

11:03.055 --> 11:04.202
Hey, babe.

11:04.302 --> 11:06.397
- Hi, honey.
- How are you?

11:07.403 --> 11:08.935
Tired.

11:09.991 --> 11:13.291
- Hi.
- Hi. Look what I brought you.

11:13.391 --> 11:16.090
Oh, you're sweet, but I'm
so icky from the restaurant.

11:16.190 --> 11:17.754
I just... I really want to
go in to take a shower.

11:17.854 --> 11:19.715
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:19.815 --> 11:24.683
What's the... what's the rush?
This is a gorgeous evening?

11:24.783 --> 11:28.027
Ha! It's L.A. They are
all gorgeous evenings.

11:28.367 --> 11:32.971
Yeah, but, this is an
especially romantic evening,

11:33.071 --> 11:35.103
isn't it? Clear...

11:35.203 --> 11:36.710
Not so much 'cause we're
right by the dumpster,

11:36.811 --> 11:40.017
and the trash guy forgot to
stop on our street again.

11:40.186 --> 11:42.839
So, listen, I'm gonna go in,
I'm gonna take a shower,

11:42.939 --> 11:44.803
and then maybe I can muster
a little romance for you.

11:44.903 --> 11:49.439
- Hold... hold on. What's the rush?
- I got to go! I'm gross. Crap.

12:08.078 --> 12:10.202
Dude, you don't have
to leave, all right?

12:10.302 --> 12:13.035
You just can't put me on
watch dog anymore, all right?

12:14.681 --> 12:18.026
Yeah. I mean, you are more than welcome
to stay with us whenever you want.

12:18.126 --> 12:19.755
You and Scotty have known
each other since birth.

12:19.855 --> 12:22.443
I only barged into your
lives about a year ago.

12:22.543 --> 12:24.696
Barging in on me was not cool.

12:26.783 --> 12:28.887
I know. I'm sorry, but, you know,

12:28.988 --> 12:31.755
you can't barge in and expect to become
one of them in six months, either.

12:31.855 --> 12:36.715
"One of them"? "Them"? What...
what does that even mean? Really?

12:36.815 --> 12:41.226
Dylan and I are in love. Okay?
Why you guys so worried about this now?

12:41.326 --> 12:44.075
Dude, she's the one who got
you the Lipnick job, remember?

12:44.175 --> 12:47.403
She just don't want to get fired when
the christian shit hits the jewish fan.

12:47.503 --> 12:49.475
No. No, I'm not worried about that.

12:49.575 --> 12:54.106
I am a phenomenal waitress,
but I am worried about you. I mean,

12:54.207 --> 12:58.763
if you're really considering marrying
Dylan, I just might think again.

12:58.863 --> 13:02.475
Her grandparents are very old school.
I mean, they are super-super-religious.

13:02.575 --> 13:07.019
So? My parents are super-religious.
They don't care if I marry a jewish girl.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.218
Mike, are you sure?
'Cause growing in Punkton, Kansas,

13:10.318 --> 13:13.713
I doubt anybody could tell Jewish
from Amish. Remember facial hair?

13:13.814 --> 13:16.702
If you had facial hair, you were an
alien from outer space. True story.

13:16.802 --> 13:20.545
Scotty, you can't change my
mind on this, okay? She's...

13:22.015 --> 13:23.914
She's just made for me.

13:24.014 --> 13:28.099
She's made for you. Hey, man, what
happened to the Mike I used to know?

13:28.199 --> 13:30.801
The one who would only take the
richest dude's daughter to the prom?

13:30.902 --> 13:32.298
Where's he at? Can I see him?

13:32.398 --> 13:33.739
- Yeah.
- I miss him.

13:33.839 --> 13:36.503
And what happened to the stock broker who
wouldn't even take a woman out to coffee

13:36.604 --> 13:40.217
without looking at her profile first?

13:40.911 --> 13:43.459
He grew up. He fell in love.

13:43.559 --> 13:47.109
Besides, do not underestimate
the potential of this restaurant.

13:47.210 --> 13:51.531
- We are really close to franchising this.
- Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay.

13:51.631 --> 13:57.002
See, I thought... I thought amigo was in
love with seÃ±orita, not the restaurante.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.523
Amigo in love with seÃ±orita,
not the restaurante.

14:06.895 --> 14:08.699
Scotty, don't be a schmuck!

14:09.646 --> 14:12.522
Besides, I'm thinking about Paul
and Elaine in this whole thing.

14:12.622 --> 14:15.002
I mean, how can they say no
to a guy who is about to

14:15.102 --> 14:18.792
- revolutionize their family business?
- Family business?

14:19.593 --> 14:23.615
You would have to die and be reborn
jewish for them to consider you family.

14:24.910 --> 14:28.586
Oy! Please! I could be as
Jewish as they wanted me to be!

14:31.822 --> 14:34.723
- Just wait until you see Jeremy.
- Who?

14:34.823 --> 14:36.770
- Who?
- The bicycle guy?

14:36.870 --> 14:39.354
Yeah. The Lipnicks totally
drool over him. Okay?

14:39.454 --> 14:42.932
He's straight out of frickin' "Fiddler on
the Roof." And now that he's back in town,

14:43.033 --> 14:46.155
they're gonna try to set Dylan
up with him. Just wait and see.

15:00.655 --> 15:02.923
Sweetheart, we need to
buy more sugar packets.

15:03.023 --> 15:05.259
I know. And we're running
out of baked apples.

15:05.359 --> 15:06.955
Oh, I thought we had so many.

15:07.055 --> 15:08.618
- No, we don't.
- What about the halva?

15:08.718 --> 15:11.115
- The halva... chocolate-covered halva.
- Oh, I love it.

15:11.215 --> 15:13.341
- Yeah.
- A lot of people like it.

15:14.191 --> 15:18.330
- Oh, I'm sorry. We're actually not open yet.
- Oh, I'm not a customer. I'm family.

15:19.591 --> 15:21.579
Would you mind telling me
who you're related to?

15:21.679 --> 15:26.538
- Look who's here. Jeremy! Bubala!
- Jeremy!

15:26.638 --> 15:30.013
Paul! Ooh! Bubbie Elaine.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.554
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

15:32.654 --> 15:35.882
I brought you these... to congratulate
you on Delilah's graduation.

15:35.982 --> 15:40.107
- How nice of you to remember.
- Where is our beautiful Delilah?

15:40.207 --> 15:42.666
She's not here now. But you are...
join us for lunch.

15:42.766 --> 15:44.963
Oh, we have some delicious food here.

15:45.063 --> 15:48.618
There is nothing I would love more than
grandma's delicious tongue on rye.

15:51.662 --> 15:54.911
But, unfortunately, I have to run. I'll be
back later, though, to pick up Delilah.

15:55.011 --> 15:57.245
She doesn't know it yet, but...

15:57.774 --> 16:00.714
I got her tickets to see the
symphony at the Hollywood bowl.

16:00.814 --> 16:02.403
- Wonderful!
- Fabulous!

16:02.503 --> 16:06.186
Michael, would you put these lovely
flowers in some water, please?

16:07.470 --> 16:09.470
He's our new assistant manager.

16:10.446 --> 16:13.738
Hi. Mike. Mike Christian.

16:13.838 --> 16:15.722
Jeremy. Jeremy Jew.

16:15.822 --> 16:18.571
- Stop it.
- Yeah, that's funny.

16:18.671 --> 16:20.995
Christian is my real
last name, actually.

16:21.095 --> 16:24.596
Well, Jew's mine, too. And if you believe
that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn

16:24.697 --> 16:26.176
I'd love to sell you.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.554
Got it. Yeah.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.319
Dylan's at the dentist right now,
and actually, I think she has plans later.

16:32.419 --> 16:34.206
Really? I thought you were
the assistant manager.

16:34.306 --> 16:36.330
What, are you her
personal secretary, too?

16:41.295 --> 16:46.076
- No, I'm her boyfriend.
- What? Wh-what did you say?

16:46.222 --> 16:50.443
Paul, Elaine, I didn't want
you guys to find out like this.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.758
I mean, you guys have taken me in,
and you've treated me like family.

16:53.859 --> 16:55.964
But I guess now is as
good a time as any.

16:58.575 --> 17:01.994
- I'm in love with your granddaughter.
- In love?

17:05.678 --> 17:07.242
You're fired! Get out!

17:07.342 --> 17:08.662
- Paul, let me explain.
- Out!

17:08.762 --> 17:11.473
- We don't want to see you. Go.
- What's going on?

17:14.906 --> 17:19.912
There's just one question I
need to ask you before I leave.

17:21.871 --> 17:25.530
Dylan Lipnick, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

17:26.415 --> 17:27.946
Will you marry me?

17:28.047 --> 17:31.099
- No!
- No! No!

17:31.887 --> 17:37.340
I'm serious. I'm committed.
I need your answer... yes or no?

17:43.566 --> 17:45.566
Oh, my god.

17:45.871 --> 17:47.018
- Yes!
- Yes?

17:47.118 --> 17:48.459
- Yes!
- Are you serious?

17:48.559 --> 17:51.498
Oh, but... no. This is a sham!

17:51.598 --> 17:54.538
Those flowers Jeremy brought for you.

17:54.638 --> 17:58.781
Then that's what the invites will say...
"Flowers by Jeremy... Jeremy Jew."

18:00.238 --> 18:04.384
You know what? Jeremy was even
kind enough to buy concert tickets.

18:05.390 --> 18:06.747
Yes.

18:07.374 --> 18:09.337
- For us.
- No!

18:10.190 --> 18:11.547
No?

18:12.270 --> 18:13.482
Yes.

18:13.582 --> 18:14.742
- Delilah...
- Thank you.

18:14.842 --> 18:17.146
...I want to see you
in my booth right now.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.393
Oy.

18:38.523 --> 18:41.303
You've known this man
for only a few months,

18:41.404 --> 18:45.056
and now you're ready to marry him?
What do you know about him?

18:46.318 --> 18:52.163
I know he's a good man with a
brilliant head on his shoulders.

18:52.975 --> 18:58.423
He's a self-directed man
with ambition and dreams.

18:59.770 --> 19:02.018
And he loves me to bits, grandpa.

19:03.279 --> 19:05.694
What more can I ask for?

19:07.014 --> 19:11.070
Jeremy waited years for
you to finish school.

19:11.982 --> 19:15.778
At least you could've given it a try,
gone out with him, something.

19:15.878 --> 19:18.940
He's not my type, grandma.
He's too...

19:19.694 --> 19:21.182
Too what?

19:21.762 --> 19:26.314
- I don't... I don't know. He's too...
- Jewish? Too jewish?

19:26.614 --> 19:29.259
Like all those worthless
people in our family?

19:29.359 --> 19:32.042
Like all the generations who suffered
so you could have a better life?

19:32.143 --> 19:33.649
Like us, I suppose?

19:37.862 --> 19:41.308
Come here, sweetheart. Listen to me.

19:42.238 --> 19:45.519
I have never seen your
grandpa this hurt.

19:46.383 --> 19:51.574
Please, just let it go for a while.
Let it be. All right?

20:16.302 --> 20:19.748
They've given up so much
to give me a better life.

20:20.878 --> 20:22.813
And what do I do in return?

20:24.383 --> 20:26.323
I crush them.

20:39.886 --> 20:44.724
Okay, so, I want to go through
an authentic conversion,

20:44.824 --> 20:48.347
one that follows the
most ancient of rituals.

20:50.414 --> 20:53.866
You do understand that this will
require a circumcision, yeah?

20:53.966 --> 20:55.403
Yes, I do.

20:55.503 --> 20:57.754
And you're kidding me, right?
It's a joke.

20:58.454 --> 21:03.295
Oh, I get it. This is an episode
of a reality show, and I'm in it.

21:03.395 --> 21:08.810
And I bet you my agent set it up. Max?
Max, where are you, you little rat? Max?

21:09.826 --> 21:11.141
- No?
- No.

21:12.678 --> 21:14.235
You're serious.

21:15.430 --> 21:17.896
All right, I have to
explain what it is.

21:18.247 --> 21:21.338
We don't have to take off the whole
megillah. We got to make a cut.

21:21.438 --> 21:24.422
But there's gonna be some blood,
there's gonna be a scalpel,

21:24.522 --> 21:27.418
there's gonna be an owie on
your pee-pee, all right?

21:27.518 --> 21:28.959
I got a question to ask you.

21:29.259 --> 21:33.425
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how much pain can you take it?

21:34.118 --> 21:37.834
- 8.5.
- No, no. No, no, no. Not 8.5.

21:37.934 --> 21:41.962
I'm... I'm more of
like a 2.1 kind of guy.

21:42.062 --> 21:43.932
You said you were in love.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.920
And this is your best friend, yeah?

21:49.798 --> 21:51.322
8.5.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.936
Okay. For love.

21:56.286 --> 21:57.959
- Hey, kid.
- 8.5.

21:58.159 --> 21:59.646
Drink to that.

22:00.806 --> 22:03.802
Under strict rabbinical law,
I have to tell you,

22:03.902 --> 22:06.106
you've got to ask me
three times so I can do it.

22:06.506 --> 22:07.494
- Please?
- No.

22:07.594 --> 22:08.421
- Please?
- No.

22:08.521 --> 22:10.718
- Please?
- Okay! That's all right.

22:10.818 --> 22:12.814
We're gonna do it. All right.

22:13.114 --> 22:17.182
And I'm gonna sing to you like a father
would sing to his little Jewish boy.

22:29.534 --> 22:33.112
Wow! I feel Jewish already.

22:33.254 --> 22:35.386
Oh, look! My foreskin just fell off!

22:35.886 --> 22:38.314
No, it... it didn't.
You still have to cut it off.

22:38.414 --> 22:39.735
You look Jewish a little bit.

22:46.290 --> 22:49.718
Welcome, welcome, my dear friends.
Good afternoon.

22:50.450 --> 22:52.287
Today, we're going to have a ceremony

22:52.398 --> 22:55.134
which you will never forget the
rest of your life, I assure you.

22:55.634 --> 23:00.852
We have a young man outside of our shul
but with a great deal of love in his heart,

23:00.952 --> 23:06.018
who has come here today to express
his love and admiration for our religion.

23:06.318 --> 23:10.626
He wants to be converted in
the most traditional way...

23:10.926 --> 23:14.218
with our oldest ritual, the bris.

23:22.538 --> 23:23.897
Rabbi.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.054
Are you comfortable?

23:31.086 --> 23:33.194
Yeah. Are you comfortable?

23:33.294 --> 23:36.274
I make a living. Are you confident?

23:37.166 --> 23:41.421
- Yeah. Are you confident?
- They're not gonna cut me.

24:23.238 --> 24:26.154
Boychick, how you feeling? See?

24:26.654 --> 24:28.241
Wasn't so bad.

24:28.674 --> 24:31.942
Yeah. Not so bad.

24:32.042 --> 24:33.396
Heimlich.

24:35.357 --> 24:38.890
So, we have some oils here
that'll make you feel better.

24:38.990 --> 24:42.112
We have everything from something
that's soothing and gentle

24:42.212 --> 24:44.312
to healing and stinging.

24:45.006 --> 24:46.914
How about some wine?

24:47.614 --> 24:49.848
You're serious? All right.

24:50.348 --> 24:53.246
- He's chosen wine.
- Wine it is. Don't worry.

24:53.346 --> 24:56.950
- You're a brave young man.
- Oh, yes. Here we go.

25:09.541 --> 25:12.607
- Mazel Tov.
- Thank you. Thank you.

25:13.582 --> 25:15.103
Mazel Tov.

25:15.234 --> 25:17.289
Oh. Oh, you came.

25:17.389 --> 25:21.490
Oh, that means so much to me.
Dylan... Dylan loves you so much,

25:21.590 --> 25:25.535
and she was afraid you weren't
gonna accept me and... Thank you.

25:26.566 --> 25:30.454
Who told you this Daniel Nudnick
was qualified to do this?

25:30.554 --> 25:32.202
You need to study six mon...

25:32.302 --> 25:34.430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
I know. I am studying.

25:34.530 --> 25:37.161
I just couldn't stay away
from my Dylan that long.

25:39.286 --> 25:40.386
Excuse me.

25:40.486 --> 25:42.588
Oh, Paul?

25:43.846 --> 25:46.646
Let's keep this
a surprise, between us.

25:52.846 --> 25:53.930
Careful.

25:58.178 --> 26:00.254
Okay, I'll be right back with some pepper.
Do you need anything else?

26:00.354 --> 26:01.818
- Just that.
- Okay, all right, great.

26:01.918 --> 26:03.302
- Hey.
- Where's Mike?

26:03.402 --> 26:06.348
Oh, why don't you ask
our new head manager?

26:07.182 --> 26:09.052
Proudest jew on the block.

26:13.266 --> 26:16.706
Why would you do that?
Hire him as head manager?

26:17.006 --> 26:21.326
No matter what you say or do,
I am never going out with him.

26:21.570 --> 26:24.710
Well, sorry to hear that,
but maybe you should tell him yourself.

26:24.810 --> 26:26.183
Go ahead. Tell him.

26:32.398 --> 26:37.002
Look, I know that this might disappoint
you, but will you please just

26:37.102 --> 26:41.661
- leave me alone?
- Oy! What am I, chopped liver?

26:42.829 --> 26:46.722
Fine. I'm leaving.
I don't need your Tsuris.

26:47.622 --> 26:49.374
Mike? What is this?

26:49.474 --> 26:53.242
Yesterday was a surprise...
a profound surprise for us, as well.

26:53.342 --> 26:57.789
He put himself through the whole
nine yards, including a traditional bris.

26:57.889 --> 27:00.041
Who knew he was gonna
be studying Hebrew?

27:01.998 --> 27:03.703
You didn't have to...

27:04.850 --> 27:06.762
I can't believe you did all this.

27:06.862 --> 27:09.731
- May I, with your permission?
- Of course.

27:14.798 --> 27:16.468
Oh, my god.

27:26.658 --> 27:28.842
- Mazel Tov.
- Mazel Tov.

27:31.058 --> 27:34.314
- Every happiness.
- It's amazing.

27:34.414 --> 27:36.874
- You like... oh, careful down there.
- Oh, sorry.

27:58.005 --> 27:59.298
Roger!

27:59.398 --> 28:02.142
- What happened?
- Come here! Come on!

28:02.242 --> 28:05.002
- What? What?
- Oh, my god.

28:05.102 --> 28:06.869
- You have to see this.
- What?

28:06.969 --> 28:09.274
No, no, no, no!
You have to read it yourself!

28:09.710 --> 28:11.277
Hands are all wet.

28:11.961 --> 28:13.864
Oh, sweet Jesus.

28:15.186 --> 28:18.400
Honey, Jesus was Jewish.

28:20.294 --> 28:22.611
Gosh. Isn't she beautiful?

28:24.310 --> 28:28.311
Well, yeah, but...
I wish he would've told us.

28:28.846 --> 28:33.733
Honey, Mike has finally
found somebody he loves.

28:34.189 --> 28:37.514
I'm going. Are you gonna join me?

28:37.614 --> 28:41.258
Of course I'm gonna join you.
But I'm not joining anything else.

28:43.254 --> 28:46.200
So, how many guests so far?

28:46.766 --> 28:52.874
Our side, we're at 200, plus you added 49,
including the stock-market janitors?

28:52.974 --> 28:55.902
Oh, good! Yes! I love those guys.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.666
Honey, it's getting late.
Don't you have to go home?

29:01.766 --> 29:05.065
Yeah. So, I don't want
you to misunderstand me.

29:05.165 --> 29:07.581
Feel free... tell me what you think.

29:08.562 --> 29:09.916
What's this?

29:10.573 --> 29:12.325
It's our prenup.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.936
No!

29:16.902 --> 29:19.254
- Hey, guys! Scotty, come here!
- Yo!

29:19.354 --> 29:23.773
You guys, we are like real celebrities.
We are like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

29:24.473 --> 29:27.232
We have got a prenup. Yeah!

29:28.013 --> 29:29.738
This is a... this is a prenup?

29:29.838 --> 29:31.614
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:31.814 --> 29:33.272
Prenup.

29:34.762 --> 29:39.064
- This is more like a phone book.
- Wow. Yeah.

29:39.598 --> 29:42.713
Okay. I know it's a bit long,
but you understand why.

29:42.813 --> 29:44.281
Oh, I know! I know! I know.

29:44.381 --> 29:49.258
Because in our Jewish culture,
before the wedding,

29:49.358 --> 29:52.766
we sign a thing called a "Patuka."

29:55.214 --> 29:57.465
- A what?
- A what?

29:57.765 --> 29:59.304
A "Topanga."

29:59.981 --> 30:02.527
A... bazooka.

30:04.250 --> 30:08.312
Umbutcha. Tenduka, Cambuna,

30:08.412 --> 30:11.403
Hakuna, Cadzuki, Shiitake.

30:11.503 --> 30:13.146
- It's a Ketubah...
- Ketubah! Yes!

30:13.346 --> 30:17.086
...Mr. Jewish groom.
And Ketubah is just one page.

30:17.454 --> 30:21.342
This is way more than one page.
This is... a lot of pages.

30:21.965 --> 30:27.146
Honey, yeah, this is a little...
Are you sure this is our prenup?

30:27.246 --> 30:29.082
It looks more like your thesis.

30:29.982 --> 30:32.410
Just read it and let me know if
you want to make any changes.

30:33.110 --> 30:34.653
- Love you.
- I love you.

30:34.753 --> 30:37.289
- Bye.
- I love our prenup!

30:37.389 --> 30:38.811
I'm glad.

30:43.986 --> 30:47.562
Dude, what are you doing?
You got to read this shit.

30:48.359 --> 30:50.750
Dude, how many credit
cards do you sign up for?

30:50.850 --> 30:53.641
You just sign "I agree" without
even reading it. Come on.

30:53.941 --> 30:56.923
Dude, this is your life we're talking
about here, not a credit card, okay?

30:57.023 --> 30:59.501
Look, there's an attorney
in my cigar club.

30:59.601 --> 31:02.054
He owes me a favor. We'll let
him read it first, all right?

31:02.154 --> 31:05.340
- Just let him read it.
- Dude, it's fine.

31:05.954 --> 31:08.472
Look... "sign here."

31:10.221 --> 31:11.722
You're out of your mind.

31:11.822 --> 31:13.855
He's in love.

31:14.990 --> 31:18.267
- I'm in love!
- Love makes you stupid.

31:19.438 --> 31:23.305
- Like "wow! Stupid!"
- Love makes me stupid.

34:19.380 --> 34:21.594
Where are we going?
What are we doing here?

34:21.694 --> 34:24.212
Don't worry about it. Thank you.

34:27.117 --> 34:29.692
- Honey, what are we doing?
- Just get the bag.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.571
Come on.

34:36.329 --> 34:38.648
Honey, whose house is this?

34:40.494 --> 34:43.487
Wow. God.

34:44.790 --> 34:46.208
Wow.

34:48.105 --> 34:49.693
Turn it on.

34:53.505 --> 34:58.273
- Welcome to your new home!
- Have a very happy married life, darlings!

34:58.473 --> 35:00.169
Have a blast!

35:01.121 --> 35:02.657
- No. No!
- Yeah.

35:05.106 --> 35:06.711
Oh, my god!

35:10.721 --> 35:12.345
I don't want them watching.

35:21.649 --> 35:23.601
Lipnick's. What the hell kind
of name is that, anyway?

35:24.209 --> 35:26.292
It's the name that's gonna
make you money, Rick.

35:26.926 --> 35:28.961
Okay, now, what's the plan of attack?
V.C.s or angels?

35:29.061 --> 35:30.908
No, no, no, no. I'd go big.
On that note,

35:31.053 --> 35:35.512
I know you guys can't afford a 15%
finder's fee, so figured I'd make it 10%?

35:38.317 --> 35:40.233
5% is industry standard.

35:40.833 --> 35:42.399
Come on, Scotty.

35:44.237 --> 35:46.334
- 5.5%.
- 8.5%.

35:46.734 --> 35:51.753
- No! It hurts.
- Damn. Okay. 5.5%.

35:52.053 --> 35:54.814
Fine. Not a cent less,
not a cent more.

36:00.145 --> 36:03.802
Gentlemen, our board of
directors loves your plan.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.985
However, our C.E.O. is
leaving town for two weeks,

36:07.085 --> 36:10.285
so we'd like to ask you not to approach
any other companies until she's back,

36:10.385 --> 36:12.073
and then we can
finalize your contract.

36:12.473 --> 36:14.977
Well, we have two
other meetings set up.

36:15.077 --> 36:16.415
We do?

36:18.509 --> 36:20.852
- Yeah, we... we do.
- Two weeks is a long time.

36:20.952 --> 36:24.361
Come on. She knows the deal. Why not
just give us the answer right now.

36:24.461 --> 36:27.424
I wish I could, but she's
heading to the airport right now.

36:29.801 --> 36:31.407
Is that your C.E.O. right there?

36:32.262 --> 36:34.528
Yes. And that's Ms. Birch.

36:35.146 --> 36:37.789
Come on. Just let us talk
to her for like one minute.

36:37.889 --> 36:39.101
'Fraid I can't.

36:39.301 --> 36:42.647
Well, we're afraid we'll have to
pursue our other options, then.

36:44.653 --> 36:46.323
Give me one minute.

36:48.337 --> 36:51.489
The gentlemen from the restaurant are here.
They'd like to speak with you just briefly.

36:51.589 --> 36:53.473
I'm on my way to a
business and golf trip.

36:53.573 --> 36:55.593
I don't have time for this.
Please just reschedule.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.414
Now is not a good
time to talk to her.

37:00.514 --> 37:02.022
I'm afraid you're just
going to have to wait.

37:02.122 --> 37:04.577
Did I hear her say something
about a golf outing?

37:04.777 --> 37:07.674
Ms. Birch is on her way to a financial
summit in Scottsdale, Arizona,

37:07.774 --> 37:10.377
but all the best deals
are done on the links.

37:10.477 --> 37:14.377
You know what? We might just have
to go and play the back nine with her.

37:15.977 --> 37:17.971
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

37:22.061 --> 37:26.249
You know, there actually are other places
we can go. I think we should look into it.

37:26.549 --> 37:28.081
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:28.181 --> 37:31.197
Grandmother's famous
recipe for tongue on rye.

37:34.893 --> 37:37.918
- It sounded like you said "tongue."
- I did.

37:39.501 --> 37:42.305
- It's cow tongue.
- Oh, cow tongue. Yeah, you know,

37:42.405 --> 37:46.164
I'm a diabetic, so tongue, lips,
face, all that's from the neck up,

37:46.264 --> 37:49.495
- I'm not supposed to digest it.
- Nice try.

37:50.605 --> 37:52.918
I'm gonna track her down
in Scottsdale, Arizona.

37:54.081 --> 37:56.321
I think her comment was a test.

37:56.621 --> 37:59.767
She purposely said it loud
enough so that we would hear it.

38:00.525 --> 38:01.546
No.

38:01.646 --> 38:05.641
Yeah. Look, these big-player types,
to them, this is all just a game.

38:05.941 --> 38:09.253
Why else would they go and
do business on a golf course?

38:09.453 --> 38:11.751
- Can you help me?
- I'm at a loss.

38:11.851 --> 38:15.227
So let's play it.
Let's play their game.

38:15.617 --> 38:19.121
I'm gonna go to the resort and
blend in with the millionaire crowd.

38:19.321 --> 38:23.218
No offense, dude, but that
takes some major camouflage.

38:24.397 --> 38:25.921
Just let me worry about that, okay?

38:26.021 --> 38:30.109
Okay, look, man. A last-minute plane ticket,
though? A five-star executive suite?

38:30.209 --> 38:33.664
Plus, your blending in would cost more
than we all can afford to put together.

38:33.861 --> 38:36.685
So, sorry to be a prick, but we all
know how your financial adventures

38:36.785 --> 38:39.805
- turned out in the past.
- Look, that was a long time ago, okay?

38:39.905 --> 38:43.129
- I have learned from those mistakes.
- I'm not so sure.

38:43.229 --> 38:47.073
Okay. What have we got to lose,
other than our own shirts?

38:48.589 --> 38:52.626
- Let's see if he can pull this off.
- Where we gonna get the seed money?

38:52.726 --> 38:55.929
What, are we gonna ask the Lipnicks?
We can't gamble on their money.

38:56.029 --> 38:58.313
We haven't made them any money.
It's ridiculous.

38:58.413 --> 39:00.512
Okay. You know what? Let's just eat.

39:00.814 --> 39:03.113
Come on. I've been waiting
all day to see you try this.

39:05.357 --> 39:07.177
- Pickle first?
- Nope.

39:11.281 --> 39:13.771
- What's this?
- Open it.

39:19.725 --> 39:23.696
It's our new visa.
Might as well break it in.

39:25.353 --> 39:27.872
What if the deal doesn't go through?

39:28.357 --> 39:33.819
At least I'll have a happy husband.
Happy he at least gave it a try.

39:35.789 --> 39:37.161
I love you.

39:41.229 --> 39:44.649
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- Come here.

39:56.965 --> 39:58.718
Here we go.

40:04.881 --> 40:08.145
- Thank you, my good man.
- And we never met.

40:09.069 --> 40:10.590
Fair enough.

40:24.061 --> 40:25.927
You guys have room for one more?

40:31.409 --> 40:32.563
Hi.

41:40.497 --> 41:43.510
Sorry! Just a little...
little tournament stress.

41:43.981 --> 41:46.614
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna go again.

41:46.797 --> 41:48.218
Yeah.

41:57.581 --> 41:58.877
Relax.

41:59.277 --> 42:01.989
Relax. Eyes on the ball.

42:02.089 --> 42:05.790
Head down. Feet shoulder-width apart.

42:06.157 --> 42:09.033
Eyes on the ball.
Keep your head down.

42:09.133 --> 42:13.116
Eyes on the ball. Mind on the ball.

42:22.568 --> 42:27.041
You are still the same lousy shooter
after all this time. Nothing's changed.

42:27.341 --> 42:29.925
What? That's what my friends
used to call me back in high...

42:30.025 --> 42:33.217
I'm Alex Birch. Nice to make
your acquaintance again.

42:33.317 --> 42:36.478
Ms. Birch. Nice to meet you.

42:36.965 --> 42:38.186
Again?

42:41.289 --> 42:42.529
Alex?

42:43.525 --> 42:44.853
Alex Roverson?

42:45.453 --> 42:48.316
It's Alex Birch now...
my married name.

42:48.493 --> 42:50.185
No way!

42:51.272 --> 42:54.391
Oh, my god! How are you? Oh!

43:00.783 --> 43:02.832
You haven't changed much.

43:03.105 --> 43:06.234
Come on. At least say I
lost some of my baby fat.

43:06.789 --> 43:11.761
Well, yeah, of course. I mean...
You looked great in high school, but...

43:12.061 --> 43:13.678
You look even better now.

43:14.501 --> 43:17.737
Thanks. You look good, too...

43:17.837 --> 43:19.945
Especially on that first tee.

43:22.185 --> 43:25.438
So, how is it that you ended up
in L.A. franchising restaurants?

43:32.565 --> 43:35.097
I was in New York for seven
years playing the market.

43:36.013 --> 43:40.992
I did okay, but then, like everyone else,
when the market crashed, I lost my shirt,

43:41.092 --> 43:45.017
so I decided to move to L.A.
and start fresh.

43:45.389 --> 43:47.241
My buddy Scott Askey...
you remember Scotty?

43:48.133 --> 43:51.433
Yeah, he... he decided to put me
up until I could get back on my feet.

43:52.533 --> 43:57.054
Guess Scotty and I share something...
getting you back on your feet.

43:57.605 --> 44:00.105
It's funny how we ended
up being neighbors again.

44:00.205 --> 44:02.985
Well, I live in the Fairfax district.

44:03.285 --> 44:07.773
I'm guessing you're more of
a Beverly Hills, Malibu girl.

44:10.705 --> 44:13.747
So, Alex Birch now?

44:14.733 --> 44:17.732
Wow. That is just...

44:18.884 --> 44:20.703
Is your husband here with you?

44:21.285 --> 44:23.838
My ex-husband.

44:24.365 --> 44:27.031
Frankly, I don't know where he is.

44:27.761 --> 44:29.789
I don't like the word "divorcÃ©e,"

44:29.889 --> 44:35.347
so I like to refer to myself
as a free bird. And you?

44:36.253 --> 44:39.909
Married. Four months ago.

44:40.717 --> 44:45.608
Congrats. Is she here?
I'd love to meet her.

44:45.708 --> 44:49.717
No. I came alone. This is
a business trip, after all.

44:50.853 --> 44:53.874
Though, given our history, I don't
know if this is such a good idea.

44:56.301 --> 44:58.221
You still haven't forgiven me.

45:00.168 --> 45:03.644
Look, maybe I can
make it up to you now.

45:04.556 --> 45:08.521
Join me for dinner. I will order
something extra special...

45:08.921 --> 45:12.149
Corn dogs with a side
of Mac and cheese.

45:13.677 --> 45:15.081
You remember that?

45:15.581 --> 45:17.992
You'd be surprised by
what else I remember.

45:24.503 --> 45:29.479
I was gonna go to a club tonight to see
some jazz. You want to come with me?

45:31.117 --> 45:32.937
Yes.

45:33.037 --> 45:35.652
Who says no to jazz?

46:07.564 --> 46:09.150
So...

46:09.925 --> 46:11.631
How many do you want?

46:12.524 --> 46:13.717
What?

46:14.217 --> 46:16.363
How many franchise
branches do you want?

46:20.181 --> 46:24.473
Well, our initial roll-out plan
was to have 25 in 5 years.

46:26.412 --> 46:28.828
How about 50 in 3 years?

46:29.852 --> 46:31.925
What would be the terms?

46:32.593 --> 46:37.999
If you can stay, we can work out
the details over the next few days.

46:39.829 --> 46:41.615
I don't know what to say.

46:43.796 --> 46:45.913
You could say no.

46:54.660 --> 46:56.300
Who told you to change partners?

46:56.480 --> 47:00.384
Alex, you're supposed to be
with Steve, Mike with Kimberly.

47:00.584 --> 47:03.919
- And no head on chest.
- But she asked my permission.

47:04.456 --> 47:08.329
- You could say no.
- Why would I? I love her.

47:47.116 --> 47:48.393
Hey, babe.

47:48.493 --> 47:50.336
Hi! What's going on?
It's Scott and Dylan.

47:50.436 --> 47:52.525
- We've been trying to reach you.
- What's up, man?

47:54.531 --> 47:59.645
Yeah. I'm good. Everything's good here.
Just... working on the deal.

48:00.109 --> 48:02.387
You sound awful.
Are you getting enough sleep?

48:03.493 --> 48:08.424
Not really. Wheelin' and
dealin' is... it is hard work.

48:09.124 --> 48:11.883
Okay. Wheelin' and dealin'. Listen...
I got a couple questions, man,

48:11.983 --> 48:15.177
I wanted to go over with you before
the meeting. What time is the meeting?

48:15.277 --> 48:16.456
It's finished.

48:16.556 --> 48:21.345
Damn it! Mike, why didn't you call me
before you screwed everything up, man?

48:21.445 --> 48:24.617
Dude, chill out, okay?

48:25.879 --> 48:29.432
I nailed it. Guess what...
we got 50 branches.

48:29.837 --> 48:31.957
We got 50 branches?

48:33.744 --> 48:35.860
All right, what's the catch, Mike?

48:36.513 --> 48:41.727
No catch. I just got to stay here for a
couple more days and finalize the details.

48:42.921 --> 48:45.705
That's unbelievable! That's fanta...
How did you talk her into that?

48:45.805 --> 48:48.356
I will tell you all about
that when I get back.

48:48.456 --> 48:50.641
- When are you back?
- When are you coming back? I miss you.

48:52.780 --> 48:55.693
Okay, yeah, I miss you, too.
I got to go.

48:55.793 --> 48:59.958
There is a meeting. It is urgent, okay?
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

49:01.540 --> 49:02.683
Cheers.

49:02.856 --> 49:04.826
- Cheers.
- We did it.

49:06.068 --> 49:08.456
- Good morning, lazy bum.
- Morning.

49:08.756 --> 49:10.860
- Who was that? The wife?
- No.

49:11.917 --> 49:15.178
Yeah. It... it was, and Scotty.

49:16.332 --> 49:18.798
Come on. Let's beat
everyone to the links.

49:19.337 --> 49:21.917
I'm not exactly a match for you.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.606
I mean, I'm a beginner at this.

49:28.308 --> 49:30.209
Remember when you
taught me how to dance?

49:30.309 --> 49:34.280
I used to trip all over the floor?
Well, it's payback time.

49:34.380 --> 49:36.136
Come on. Go... get dressed.

50:29.464 --> 50:30.889
Let's go drink.

50:34.468 --> 50:36.672
- Come on!
- Let's see what you've got.

50:36.972 --> 50:40.335
All right, here we go.
That's one. That's one!

50:42.956 --> 50:45.855
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

50:47.188 --> 50:48.596
Come on!

50:52.780 --> 50:55.228
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

50:57.556 --> 50:59.757
In your face! Come on.
You ready? Here we go.

51:23.212 --> 51:24.512
Here we go!

51:30.721 --> 51:32.209
Yeah!

51:34.092 --> 51:36.638
One more! One more!
One more! One more!

51:37.229 --> 51:39.261
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

52:01.481 --> 52:04.456
If your flight was at 3 o'clock I
could've dropped you off at the airport.

52:05.056 --> 52:09.756
I know, I know. You got to run.
Tournament's about to start.

52:10.312 --> 52:12.480
If you wait until Monday,
we could go together.

52:12.580 --> 52:16.173
I have to report back to
my boss before I get fired.

52:17.036 --> 52:18.655
I understand.

52:20.233 --> 52:22.551
I really enjoyed our time together.

52:23.500 --> 52:26.718
Me too. I'll see you in L.A.?

52:53.029 --> 52:56.361
- Dude, you look like shit.
- Nice to see you, too.

52:56.461 --> 52:59.606
- Did you get the L.O.I. Signed?
- Not yet.

53:00.045 --> 53:02.433
Bro, you know how iffy these deals can be.
You said you had it in the bag.

53:02.533 --> 53:05.448
Dude, relax. The deal is locked in.

53:05.648 --> 53:07.581
What makes you so sure?

53:09.249 --> 53:11.287
I found a shortcut.

53:13.972 --> 53:16.867
You know their C.E.O., Alex Birch?

53:17.581 --> 53:22.086
Her maiden name is Alex Roverson.

53:22.500 --> 53:25.928
Alex... Alex Roverson?

53:26.128 --> 53:29.296
The prom queen who went
missing Alex Roverson?

53:30.600 --> 53:34.888
You got to be kidding me. So, why
didn't you get the L.O.I. signed again?

53:34.988 --> 53:38.216
Alex is coming to the restaurant on Friday.
I thought it'd be more official that way.

53:39.416 --> 53:44.196
So, if you weren't there closing the deal,
what were you doing there the whole time?

53:44.296 --> 53:46.793
We were just catching
up on things, you know,

53:47.793 --> 53:49.786
doing the whole P.R. game with her,

53:49.886 --> 53:52.718
telling her what a great
franchise Lipnick's is gonna be.

53:54.104 --> 53:56.808
Five days is a long time to talk.

53:56.908 --> 53:59.705
Did she tell you why she
went missing prom night?

54:01.284 --> 54:03.804
Okay. You know what?

54:06.104 --> 54:07.771
Wait. What are you doing?

54:09.036 --> 54:10.481
Rick.

54:10.588 --> 54:14.472
Yeah, look, can you set up the backup
meetings for Fresco and K.C. And company?

54:14.572 --> 54:16.027
Really?

54:17.500 --> 54:19.754
Yeah. Okay, thanks, man.

54:21.868 --> 54:22.912
What are you doing?

54:23.012 --> 54:25.564
Yeah, I've been doing some talking,
too, myself, all right? Just in case.

54:25.664 --> 54:29.211
- Dude, we have a deal.
- I don't want a deal.

54:29.311 --> 54:31.752
I don't even think we should be doing
business with her in the first place.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.808
Scotty, you worry too much.

54:33.908 --> 54:38.015
Yeah, yeah. I'm the idiot.
You're the optimist. I forgot.

54:49.716 --> 54:51.587
Shit.

54:52.104 --> 54:53.975
Does Alex really live there?

54:54.797 --> 54:58.756
Dude, if I were you, I wouldn't
dare go anywhere near her.

54:58.856 --> 55:01.276
Yeah, Mike, I think you should
really reconsider Kimberly.

55:01.376 --> 55:03.832
Dude, she probably thinks
you're some millionaire's son

55:03.932 --> 55:06.840
with all those boss shirts you've
with all been borrowing from Scott.

55:06.940 --> 55:08.800
Those boss shirts that I've
been borrowing from Scott

55:08.900 --> 55:11.080
don't even make Scott look
like a millionaire, dude.

55:11.180 --> 55:13.536
You guys are just jealous.
I'm an optimist, all right?

55:13.636 --> 55:18.040
I look at the brighter side
of things. Okay? Bye-bye.

55:18.540 --> 55:22.588
- You want us to wait?
- No. Alex said we'll take her limo.

55:27.852 --> 55:31.482
- Okay. Let's go.
- No, wait a sec.

55:44.652 --> 55:47.624
I'm here to pick up Alex.
She's expecting me.

55:47.724 --> 55:50.735
Tux, corsage, prom date.

55:51.332 --> 55:53.928
You're mistaken, young man.
Miss Alex has left for the weekend.

55:55.328 --> 55:58.426
Come on, big guy.
No, we... we have a date.

55:59.152 --> 56:02.056
Sir, I mean, it's prom. She...
she can't be gone. She has to be here.

56:02.156 --> 56:04.360
So can you call her down
here so I can talk to her?

56:04.460 --> 56:06.024
Are you implying that
I've lied to you?

56:06.124 --> 56:10.046
No. No, no, no. Just... just that
there's apparently a misunderstanding.

56:10.146 --> 56:12.849
Is there someone else that I can
talk to, like how about the driver?

56:12.949 --> 56:14.956
- I mean, he must know her plans.
- I'm the limo driver.

56:15.756 --> 56:17.496
What? How do you guard the
house and drive at the same...

56:17.596 --> 56:20.936
It's none of your business what I do.
Now you need to leave.

56:21.036 --> 56:24.228
You can do that the
easy or the hard way.

56:24.328 --> 56:27.731
I strongly suggest the
easy way. Up to you.

56:45.356 --> 56:46.216
Where you going?

56:46.316 --> 56:48.657
Alex! Alex!

56:48.772 --> 56:50.456
- Alex!
- Give him to me.

56:50.556 --> 56:52.584
Alex, come outside!
Come outside right now!

56:52.684 --> 56:57.096
I'm here to pick you up! Alex!
Okay. All right.

56:57.196 --> 57:01.147
Alex! Alex, come outside!

57:01.580 --> 57:04.488
Alex, I'm here to pick you up!
I have your corsage!

57:04.788 --> 57:07.516
It's purple! It matches my tie! Alex!

57:13.612 --> 57:15.806
- You okay?
- Yeah.

57:29.332 --> 57:31.181
- No! Stop!
- What?

57:31.836 --> 57:36.650
Shit. Sorry, honey.
I was just having a bad dream.

57:38.732 --> 57:41.432
- Hey, wifey.
- Hi, hubby.

57:45.272 --> 57:47.884
You're jet-lagged like you
went to Europe or something.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.320
Look at that picture there.

57:55.008 --> 57:59.688
Don't worry. One day, Lipnick's is
gonna have all the magazine ads.

57:59.888 --> 58:03.228
I'm not talking about that one.
The one to the right of it.

58:04.912 --> 58:08.136
That magazine went out of business.
They're gonna be gone within a month.

58:08.236 --> 58:13.781
Can you stop talking about business?
I'm talking about family.

58:14.944 --> 58:17.704
Of course. I'm talking
about family, too.

58:17.804 --> 58:22.624
I am talking about
our family's... future.

58:24.372 --> 58:26.274
I want to have twins
just like that...

58:26.374 --> 58:31.371
one that looks like you and one that looks
like me. Identical twins are so boring.

58:34.616 --> 58:36.316
I'm sorry.

58:38.472 --> 58:39.760
What do you mean?

58:39.860 --> 58:44.704
I kind of wasted your money, I think.
I don't think there's gonna be a deal.

58:45.304 --> 58:47.840
But there are other companies
we're gonna go to.

58:47.940 --> 58:50.104
I know a whole bunch of
people we can talk to.

58:50.204 --> 58:53.336
Relax. You don't have to.

58:54.604 --> 58:57.052
Let's just be happy
with what we have.

59:06.004 --> 59:07.264
I missed you.

59:07.364 --> 59:09.435
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:10.532 --> 59:12.808
- How much?
- A lot.

59:12.908 --> 59:13.992
Really?

59:19.915 --> 59:21.337
Hey.

59:33.548 --> 59:36.776
Evening, madam.
Welcome to Lipnick's. Table for two?

59:36.876 --> 59:39.261
- Just one.
- Come with me.

59:42.824 --> 59:44.552
Your waitress will be right with you.

59:44.852 --> 59:48.903
- I suppose you're Dylan?
- Yeah. Have we met before?

59:49.876 --> 59:52.379
Alex... Alex Birch.

59:53.004 --> 59:56.039
Oh. Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

59:56.139 --> 59:57.884
- Nice to meet you, as well.
- Hey, Alex.

59:57.984 --> 01:00:00.460
- Hi.
- Wow. What a surprise.

01:00:01.908 --> 01:00:06.528
This is... this is my wife, Dylan.
Dylan, this is... Alex Birch.

01:00:06.628 --> 01:00:09.916
- I got it.
- She's the C.E.O. of Girthan's...

01:00:10.016 --> 01:00:14.791
- I am just an old high school classmate.
- Yeah. Mike told me.

01:00:15.688 --> 01:00:18.156
Please make yourself
comfortable, and welcome.

01:00:18.256 --> 01:00:19.627
Thank you.

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:28.495
She's beautiful.

01:00:32.816 --> 01:00:35.752
Why'd you go to Fresco?
They're my main competitors.

01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:40.926
I... I talked to, some of the...
some of the... some of my partners,

01:00:41.026 --> 01:00:45.116
and... well, they were... they were
afraid of a conflict of interest.

01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:46.782
Mike, cut the bullshit.

01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:50.437
You don't trust me, do you?

01:01:09.103 --> 01:01:10.422
What's this?

01:01:10.948 --> 01:01:14.491
Proof of trust. Cash it
anytime you see a red flag.

01:01:14.732 --> 01:01:16.896
So come by my office,
sign the contract,

01:01:16.996 --> 01:01:19.545
and let's finalize this
deal once and for all.

01:01:47.628 --> 01:01:50.728
Would you put that back in our pocket,
Mike? That's a lot of fucking money.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:53.436
By the way, I think I'm
really starting to like Alex.

01:01:53.536 --> 01:01:55.324
You can't get a better proof
of trust than that check.

01:01:55.424 --> 01:01:58.567
Okay. So what exactly do
you know about the divorce?

01:01:58.667 --> 01:02:01.663
Nothing other than the fact
that she just had a rough time.

01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:03.768
Okay, well, I heard differently
at the reunion last year.

01:02:03.868 --> 01:02:06.940
Apparently, she dumped the guy after one
year and ended up with most of his money.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.383
You know what? That's probably
just a lot of people talking smack.

01:02:09.483 --> 01:02:12.683
You know, I don't really care, Mike.
I just want to know.

01:02:12.783 --> 01:02:17.184
Is there anything between you two?
Dude, we all worked hard on this.

01:02:17.284 --> 01:02:21.361
Damn it, Scott, are you not seeing the
frickin' value in a million-dollar check?

01:02:21.461 --> 01:02:23.908
All those zer...
are you kidding me? Really?

01:02:24.008 --> 01:02:26.556
You know what? I'm not letting this
come between us. I'm just returning it.

01:02:26.656 --> 01:02:31.240
What? Can you... can I...
Just hold it one last time?

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:35.412
Hey. There will be plenty to
hold in the future, buddy.

01:02:40.615 --> 01:02:42.001
Fuck!

01:03:04.624 --> 01:03:05.566
You.

01:03:05.666 --> 01:03:08.756
- Who are you, sir? You look familiar.
- Yeah, so do you.

01:03:08.856 --> 01:03:12.184
You remind me of some a-hole back in
Punkton, Kansas, when I was a kid.

01:03:12.684 --> 01:03:16.604
Oh, yeah, I remember you. Sorry, kid.

01:03:16.704 --> 01:03:20.940
I mean "Sir." I was just
doing my job. Come on in.

01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:24.464
You still pissed at me?

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:31.964
You know, if you'd have been
four inches shorter back then,

01:03:32.064 --> 01:03:34.033
I would have taught you some manners.

01:03:34.888 --> 01:03:37.086
You know, she was home that night.

01:03:39.475 --> 01:03:41.151
- She lied to me?
- I lied.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:45.179
She cried in her room for days, maybe
weeks. Baby girl was in some major pain.

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:49.596
Seems boss man had some sort of stick
up his ass about your family being too...

01:03:49.696 --> 01:03:51.176
too common.

01:03:51.988 --> 01:03:54.072
She doesn't like to receive greetings
on her birthday these days.

01:03:54.172 --> 01:03:58.556
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Today's her birthday?
- You didn't know? Then why are you here?

01:03:58.956 --> 01:04:01.902
Shit. I should've brought a gift.

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.235
- Holy shit.
- I know.

01:04:19.035 --> 01:04:23.069
- Who else lives here with her?
- Just her. This way.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.372
No hard feelings, sir?

01:04:35.147 --> 01:04:36.673
Carry on.

01:04:46.892 --> 01:04:48.112
Hi.

01:04:55.488 --> 01:04:57.177
Happy birthday.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.698
Thanks.

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:03.586
Why don't you come down to Lipnick's?
We'll make you a nice birthday meal.

01:05:06.448 --> 01:05:10.903
I want to be alone, Mike.
I think I deserve that.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:13.690
Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

01:05:15.943 --> 01:05:17.531
Can you...

01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:21.085
Never mind.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.436
What?

01:05:24.844 --> 01:05:27.941
Can you spare, like,

01:05:28.041 --> 01:05:31.964
three hours for me?
No one else?

01:05:33.128 --> 01:05:35.577
I promise... no business.

01:05:41.035 --> 01:05:42.872
I didn't think so.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:44.593
Okay.

01:05:46.135 --> 01:05:47.937
What do you want to do?

01:06:15.884 --> 01:06:17.422
Can you hear me?

01:06:19.335 --> 01:06:21.600
- Now can you hear me?
- Yes, I can.

01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:16.386
Holy cow!

01:07:21.451 --> 01:07:25.512
- This was your husband's?
- No. It was my family's.

01:07:25.612 --> 01:07:28.855
But it's mine now that
my dad's passed away.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:34.215
Actually, I've got some clothes
for you, if you want to change.

01:07:34.315 --> 01:07:35.960
Right through there.

01:07:54.095 --> 01:07:55.385
Hi.

01:08:00.395 --> 01:08:03.271
Here you go. Is there anything else
I can do for you, Ms. Roverson?

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:07.511
No, thank you. You can go
home for the rest of the night.

01:08:09.443 --> 01:08:11.316
Happy birthday.

01:08:11.496 --> 01:08:12.952
Thanks.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.392
You know, there's a
movie theater inside,

01:08:20.492 --> 01:08:23.551
and I have "Superman" all
cued up and ready to go.

01:08:24.451 --> 01:08:26.553
"Superman"... Wow.

01:08:27.499 --> 01:08:29.366
That brings back memories.

01:08:30.692 --> 01:08:31.881
I know.

01:08:33.424 --> 01:08:35.656
You watched it two times in a row.

01:08:36.331 --> 01:08:37.698
At the drive-in.

01:08:39.675 --> 01:08:41.148
How did you know that?

01:08:41.848 --> 01:08:45.926
I was there... in the last row...

01:08:46.227 --> 01:08:47.995
watching you.

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:51.768
I came there because I
wanted to say goodbye,

01:08:51.868 --> 01:08:56.647
and I wanted to apologize, but...
I wasn't allowed to.

01:08:56.846 --> 01:08:59.877
I tried every excuse in the book to
sneak out of that car and come see you,

01:08:59.977 --> 01:09:02.715
but the driver wouldn't let me.

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:05.296
My dad's orders.

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.807
To Superman.

01:09:15.099 --> 01:09:17.359
Truth, justice, and the American way.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:23.563
You remember that scene when he's
able to spin the earth backwards?

01:09:24.608 --> 01:09:26.232
Yeah.

01:09:27.046 --> 01:09:30.617
Sometimes I wish I could spin the
world back thirteen years, you know?

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:34.420
Me too.

01:09:39.959 --> 01:09:42.045
I... I can't.

01:09:45.002 --> 01:09:46.906
I understand.

01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:51.037
I can't, but...

01:10:20.107 --> 01:10:22.767
So, you gonna tell me where
you disappeared to last night?

01:10:24.555 --> 01:10:27.112
I thought I told you.
I went to Alex's office.

01:10:27.212 --> 01:10:30.175
Yeah, Scott told me, but I thought
that was yesterday afternoon.

01:10:30.475 --> 01:10:34.911
Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Yesterday
was her birthday, and I didn't even know.

01:10:35.011 --> 01:10:39.350
Yeah, they had a big beach party
for her out at her house in Malibu.

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:42.651
I couldn't say no.
I was gonna call you, but...

01:10:42.751 --> 01:10:46.492
Oh, that's fine. Just didn't
want you to drink and drive.

01:10:46.827 --> 01:10:48.893
Just worried about you.

01:10:55.635 --> 01:11:00.088
We had a very good meeting with Fresco.
You want to know the way I see it?

01:11:01.003 --> 01:11:02.879
All right, look,
Fresco made a valid point...

01:11:02.979 --> 01:11:06.051
we should start with five branches.
That way, we all get to bed on time,

01:11:06.151 --> 01:11:09.196
- we still reach our goal.
- Jesus, grandpa, what are you, 80?

01:11:09.296 --> 01:11:11.251
We need to enter this
thing with a big bang.

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:14.023
Can't leave room for lots of little
copycat's to start popping up.

01:11:14.123 --> 01:11:17.161
Yeah, I don't even know why we
took that meeting today. I mean,

01:11:17.261 --> 01:11:19.335
we have a better deal at Girthan's.

01:11:19.435 --> 01:11:20.641
Thank you.

01:11:25.159 --> 01:11:27.359
- Did you fuck her?
- Scotty.

01:11:27.459 --> 01:11:28.845
Just checking.

01:11:31.135 --> 01:11:33.053
Rick, could you give us a minute?

01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:36.158
Could you give us a minute, please?

01:11:38.495 --> 01:11:39.754
Got it.

01:11:41.907 --> 01:11:44.056
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

01:11:44.191 --> 01:11:46.951
But where were you last night, Mike?

01:11:47.051 --> 01:11:51.531
Scotty, let's talk business, okay?
No biases, no conflicts of interest.

01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:55.227
- She is giving us the deal of a lifetime.
- I never disagreed with that.

01:11:55.327 --> 01:11:59.002
And for the record, she did not stand
me up at prom. It was her dad, not her.

01:12:00.327 --> 01:12:03.243
Well, what happened to her check?
Did you return it?

01:12:09.387 --> 01:12:12.190
Scott, Scotty, Scottster...

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.732
Do not fuck this up.
Just let's look at it this way.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:21.206
As long as we're making a pile of cash,
who really cares who fucks who?

01:12:22.715 --> 01:12:24.799
- Yeah...
- Scotty...

01:12:26.347 --> 01:12:31.194
No goof-ups. Trust me.
Yeah, I promise.

01:12:31.955 --> 01:12:36.233
Well, I think the proposal is perfect
as is, so I'm signing off on it.

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:42.971
We have a deal.

01:12:43.779 --> 01:12:46.503
- We have a deal.
- We have a deal.

01:14:14.763 --> 01:14:16.568
I love you.

01:14:17.263 --> 01:14:19.894
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

01:14:22.219 --> 01:14:25.779
I feel like my life had passed
me by until I saw you again.

01:14:27.199 --> 01:14:32.243
I'm committed, Mike. I'm willing
to be in this for the long haul.

01:14:32.911 --> 01:14:34.946
But it's up to you.

01:14:37.927 --> 01:14:42.173
I'll wait until Christmas
to hear your answer.

01:14:53.675 --> 01:14:55.610
I fuckin' knew it.

01:14:56.266 --> 01:14:58.583
You playing with
people's lives again?

01:14:59.623 --> 01:15:00.949
You...

01:15:02.663 --> 01:15:05.191
You are a dangerous
man to know, Mike.

01:15:05.291 --> 01:15:07.542
I know. I'm sorry.

01:15:08.844 --> 01:15:10.375
What do I tell Dylan?

01:15:10.575 --> 01:15:14.779
I'm not a freakin' counselor, Mike.
What kind of question is that?

01:15:14.879 --> 01:15:18.375
"Do I dump my wife
before I close the deal?

01:15:18.475 --> 01:15:22.083
Or do I close the deal,
then dump her?"

01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:25.351
Well, what would you
do if you were me?

01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:26.986
Me?

01:15:27.086 --> 01:15:31.523
I would've taken Kimberly to the
prom thirteen years ago, okay?

01:15:31.623 --> 01:15:35.079
- That's what I would've done.
- Dude, come on, like...

01:15:35.179 --> 01:15:38.008
I really need your help.
You're my best friend.

01:15:38.491 --> 01:15:45.110
Why do you keep getting yourself in
the same situations over and over?

01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:49.908
You got a rich girl on one side
and a poor one on the other.

01:15:55.963 --> 01:15:58.462
You calling me a gold digger?

01:15:59.307 --> 01:16:01.307
I'll answer that later.

01:16:02.619 --> 01:16:05.023
First, you tell me...

01:16:06.164 --> 01:16:07.887
did you sleep with her or not?

01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:13.550
Oh, shit.

01:16:15.531 --> 01:16:17.052
Do you love her?

01:16:19.431 --> 01:16:21.201
Oh, shit!

01:16:23.567 --> 01:16:26.226
- What do I do?
- How am I supposed to know?

01:16:28.426 --> 01:16:33.212
Remember, you're the one who looks
at everything on the bright side.

01:16:37.715 --> 01:16:41.127
Tell you what. Do both women.

01:16:41.227 --> 01:16:46.548
Do both women, keep the franchise,
and two helicopters, too.

01:16:47.147 --> 01:16:51.473
And I'll stay quiet for life.
Know why?

01:16:53.495 --> 01:16:55.591
'Cause I'm your best...
I'm your best friend.

01:16:55.691 --> 01:16:58.407
- You're drunk. Come on.
- Let me go.

01:16:58.507 --> 01:17:00.889
You're the one that needs a hand.

01:17:03.467 --> 01:17:05.053
Finish that.

01:17:26.507 --> 01:17:28.147
<i>"Dearest Dylan.</i>

01:17:28.819 --> 01:17:31.448
<i>"I'm sorry I didn't have the
guts to tell you this in person.</i>

01:17:31.835 --> 01:17:34.331
<i>I have so much gratitude for you
in my heart for all the love</i>

01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:37.442
<i>and everything you and your
family have done for me.</i>

01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:43.253
<i>But I haven't lived up to your love.
I have a confession.</i>

01:17:44.107 --> 01:17:46.391
<i>I have fallen in love with Alex.</i>

01:17:47.202 --> 01:17:49.883
<i>Perhaps I've been in love
with her my entire life.</i>

01:17:50.282 --> 01:17:52.832
<i>She was my childhood sweetheart.</i>

01:17:53.191 --> 01:17:57.445
<i>Until the past few months, to me,
she was a dream unfulfilled.</i>

01:17:58.643 --> 01:18:02.053
<i>I recently found out that
I was her dream, too.</i>

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.956
<i>When we reconnected
after such a long time,</i>

01:18:05.094 --> 01:18:08.694
<i>we instantly felt that nothing
between us has changed with time.</i>

01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:13.577
<i>In fact, our love has grown
in the last few weeks.</i>

01:18:13.834 --> 01:18:15.952
<i>If I deny these feelings,</i>

01:18:16.052 --> 01:18:21.647
<i>I'll be a lousy husband cheating
on a loyal, wonderful wife like you.</i>

01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:29.533
<i>You deserve more.
You deserve better.</i>

01:18:32.203 --> 01:18:36.682
<i>It is with sorrow that I am writing
this to you to request a divorce.</i>

01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:44.788
<i>Hopefully one without
too much animosity."</i>

01:19:09.771 --> 01:19:10.862
Okay.

01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:27.979
He's here.

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:33.750
Wait, wait, wait!
You can't escape that easily.

01:19:33.974 --> 01:19:37.220
Come on over here. Come. Come on.

01:19:41.099 --> 01:19:42.903
Come in. Zits.

01:19:45.007 --> 01:19:46.129
Sit.

01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:50.837
So, now that we have our man,
let me say a few words.

01:19:52.451 --> 01:19:57.370
As you all know, our beloved
Mike surprised us very much

01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:01.811
with his unexpected Jewishness
and his total conversion.

01:20:02.287 --> 01:20:07.774
And recently, he surprised us
with his Lipnick's franchise plan.

01:20:08.074 --> 01:20:13.115
He's a man of many surprises.
So now it's our turn.

01:20:13.215 --> 01:20:17.643
Time to give Mike the surprise of
his life, and when he hears this,

01:20:17.743 --> 01:20:21.855
believe me... he won't forget
this day so long as he lives.

01:20:22.155 --> 01:20:27.685
So, without further ado,
I want to announce today...

01:20:29.138 --> 01:20:30.179
that...

01:20:31.135 --> 01:20:33.478
I'm gonna be a great-grandfather!

01:20:35.278 --> 01:20:38.111
A great-grandpa! Mazel Tov!

01:20:38.211 --> 01:20:41.639
And Mike's gonna be a father!
Everybody, raise your glass.

01:20:41.739 --> 01:20:46.418
L'chaim! L'chaim. What a mitzvah.
Oh, look at them.

01:20:46.518 --> 01:20:50.223
What a couple.
Oh, they're so beautiful.

01:20:50.323 --> 01:20:53.246
Nice, beautiful Jewish children
they're going to have.

01:20:53.346 --> 01:20:58.215
Oh, my. Mazel Tov.
Oh, oh, it's so wonderful.

01:20:58.315 --> 01:21:01.091
Thank you. Oh, I'm so proud of you.

01:21:01.191 --> 01:21:03.843
Oh. You'll have twins,
maybe quintuplets.

01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:07.037
Oh, a bunch of little Jewish
babies running around!

01:21:08.291 --> 01:21:12.397
Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.

01:21:14.123 --> 01:21:15.334
Scotty.

01:21:18.058 --> 01:21:21.751
Scotty, pick up.
Pick up, pick up.

01:21:23.275 --> 01:21:25.830
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- She's pregnant.

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:28.327
- Who?
- What?

01:21:28.427 --> 01:21:30.743
I'm sorry, but with you,
I need to ask who.

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:35.382
- Dylan.
- Holy shit.

01:21:35.978 --> 01:21:39.485
- Exactly. There's more.
- Always.

01:21:40.194 --> 01:21:44.319
I sent an e-mail to her
telling her about Alex.

01:21:44.682 --> 01:21:47.751
You sent an e-mail? That's harsh.

01:21:48.051 --> 01:21:52.783
Scotty, focus, okay? Focus.
Help now, judge later.

01:21:52.883 --> 01:21:57.287
I need you to call your tech guys and
ask them how to recover an e-mail.

01:21:57.887 --> 01:21:59.769
Don't you know her password?

01:22:01.354 --> 01:22:03.543
- No!
- Shit.

01:22:03.743 --> 01:22:06.727
Mike, there's no way to
recall an e-mail. Trust me.

01:22:08.474 --> 01:22:11.702
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:15.931
Okay. Okay, Mike. Get it together.

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:18.779
Get it together, Mike.
Get it together.

01:22:19.583 --> 01:22:21.170
There's at least 50 restaurants here.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:24.600
I never, ever thought we'd be able
to retire, but if this works out,

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:28.015
maybe we can. Or at least
cut back on our hours.

01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:32.711
Retire? Oh, sweetheart.
We're not gonna retire.

01:22:32.811 --> 01:22:34.859
We're just gonna begin to live.

01:22:35.487 --> 01:22:39.418
- I got to go.
- Okay. I'll see you at home.

01:22:44.683 --> 01:22:46.114
I'll show them the rest.

01:22:46.214 --> 01:22:49.137
- All right, let's see.
- He did this all himself.

01:23:45.486 --> 01:23:46.939
Sorry.

01:23:47.274 --> 01:23:50.311
- Didn't mean to wake you up.
- I wasn't sleeping.

01:23:50.511 --> 01:23:54.330
I was at the office with Scott,
and then we went to dinner, and...

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:57.129
It's okay. Come on in.

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:00.745
I read your e-mail.

01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:10.758
I'm sorry. Okay? I...

01:24:10.858 --> 01:24:15.546
I wouldn't have sent it if I
had known... the news earlier.

01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:21.506
So, you would have continued to
cheat on your wife? For how long?

01:24:21.706 --> 01:24:23.934
No. No, no. I... I don't mean that.

01:24:24.034 --> 01:24:27.686
I just mean I would've waited
for the... the right time.

01:24:27.986 --> 01:24:31.942
The right time.
And when would that be?

01:24:32.342 --> 01:24:34.946
Dylan, I am sorry. Okay?

01:24:35.046 --> 01:24:37.856
It's just I'm kind of
in a corner right now.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:42.393
She wants to leave by Christmas,
and she wanted an answer before then.

01:24:43.786 --> 01:24:46.399
Oh. Oh, she does, does she?

01:24:49.106 --> 01:24:53.619
Okay. Well, at first, I was upset.

01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:57.512
After I calmed myself down a bit,

01:24:57.858 --> 01:25:02.534
I thought about it.
I tried to be objective...

01:25:02.834 --> 01:25:06.671
Tried to understand where
you were coming from.

01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:09.811
Thank you.

01:25:10.155 --> 01:25:12.308
And I've come to a decision.

01:25:15.663 --> 01:25:17.465
The answer is no.

01:25:19.495 --> 01:25:23.524
- What?
- You heard me. No.

01:25:26.144 --> 01:25:28.558
W-what do you mean "No"?

01:25:29.147 --> 01:25:32.053
- No to what?
- To a divorce. No.

01:25:35.598 --> 01:25:38.526
I understand where
you're coming from.

01:25:38.695 --> 01:25:41.054
Okay, knowing what we know now,

01:25:41.154 --> 01:25:44.422
I'm not gonna insist on
it right away, obviously.

01:25:44.522 --> 01:25:49.667
No. Not by tomorrow, not by Christmas,
not by any deadline she may give you.

01:25:49.767 --> 01:25:53.567
I'm not signing divorce papers
for you ever in my life, period.

01:25:55.038 --> 01:25:56.478
Good night.

01:26:02.482 --> 01:26:04.282
So, you have to go by Christmas?

01:26:04.734 --> 01:26:08.093
Look, I understand
your dilemma, Mike.

01:26:08.554 --> 01:26:12.463
Just let me go. Be with her.

01:26:12.863 --> 01:26:14.947
I'm not gonna force
you into anything.

01:26:16.459 --> 01:26:19.734
And don't worry. I'm not gonna
back out of the franchise deal.

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:22.807
That's not what I'm worried about.

01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:28.201
She's pregnant.

01:26:35.046 --> 01:26:36.599
Congratulations.

01:26:37.506 --> 01:26:40.918
That's exciting.
You are gonna be a great dad.

01:26:42.538 --> 01:26:46.360
I hope your baby gets those
beautiful long eyelashes.

01:26:49.026 --> 01:26:51.293
I wasn't ready for this.

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:54.352
I don't want to lose you again, Alex.

01:26:56.426 --> 01:26:58.197
Okay.

01:26:58.698 --> 01:27:00.633
I can wait.

01:27:01.674 --> 01:27:03.209
How long do you think?

01:27:05.226 --> 01:27:07.205
I'm afraid it may never happen.

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:12.338
Okay.

01:27:13.226 --> 01:27:17.243
It's all right, Mike.
I just want you to be happy.

01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:22.038
- It's all right.
- No, it's not me.

01:27:22.826 --> 01:27:28.168
She said no... no to the divorce...
not now, not ever.

01:27:29.926 --> 01:27:32.934
Oh, my gosh. She sounds
like just like my ex-husband.

01:27:33.034 --> 01:27:35.482
He never wanted to let me go, either.

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.955
That bloodsucking leech.

01:27:40.162 --> 01:27:44.940
Should've known better than
to sign that prenup. So stupid.

01:27:47.434 --> 01:27:51.606
Never sign a prenuptial agreement
without reading it carefully.

01:27:51.706 --> 01:27:54.218
There are so many snakes
to bite you on the ass

01:27:54.318 --> 01:27:56.550
that the devil's
pitchfork up the wazoo

01:27:56.654 --> 01:28:00.249
is gonna come as a welcome
relief by comparison.

01:28:01.298 --> 01:28:04.326
Scott, how could you not let
me read this fucking bible?

01:28:04.426 --> 01:28:06.742
I would've done it for free!
And you! You...

01:28:06.842 --> 01:28:10.089
How do you sign this thing
without giving it to me first?

01:28:10.698 --> 01:28:13.560
All right. All right. Here we go.

01:28:14.602 --> 01:28:17.190
Here we go, okay. Here is
the clause that's the killer.

01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:22.378
If you ask for a divorce, you have to
arrange a formal divorce ceremony.

01:28:22.478 --> 01:28:26.573
Such ceremony must consist of the guests
attended the wedding in the first place.

01:28:26.673 --> 01:28:29.085
It has to take place in
the same wedding venue.

01:28:29.185 --> 01:28:31.356
The couple will wear the same
attire from their wedding day,

01:28:31.456 --> 01:28:35.774
and only then is she legally bound
to sign your divorce application.

01:28:35.874 --> 01:28:40.998
On top of that, you also have the burden of
explaining your reasons for your divorce.

01:28:41.098 --> 01:28:43.806
The ceremony will be followed
by a lavish dinner and dancing,

01:28:43.906 --> 01:28:46.965
which will be paid for... by you.

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:55.020
In short, she's a genius.

01:28:57.931 --> 01:29:00.902
She's got you by the balls.
You're fucked.

01:29:04.718 --> 01:29:06.938
Welcome to the club.

01:29:07.458 --> 01:29:09.606
Although I have some good news.

01:29:09.706 --> 01:29:13.638
There's a 10 percent discount
on the people attending.

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:18.726
Good luck, buddy!

01:29:25.771 --> 01:29:28.934
Bastard. Con man.

01:29:29.034 --> 01:29:32.042
He pulled the "I'll be Jewish"
wool over our eyes.

01:29:32.142 --> 01:29:35.366
You mean your eyes. I told you
it wasn't a proper conversion.

01:29:35.466 --> 01:29:37.566
Why would you let that
bastard live in your place?

01:29:37.666 --> 01:29:42.183
- Why don't you kick him out?
- Grandpa! How does that help me?

01:29:42.826 --> 01:29:45.494
At least I'll have somebody to
call 911 in case, god forbid,

01:29:45.594 --> 01:29:47.358
something happens to me
in the middle of the night.

01:29:47.458 --> 01:29:49.914
Well, you move in with us.
We'll take care of you.

01:29:50.014 --> 01:29:52.730
Why should you?
It's his responsibility, too.

01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:55.558
You know, nowadays they say,
"We are pregnant."

01:29:55.658 --> 01:29:58.319
Why should he have the easy
way out? Let him do his share.

01:29:58.490 --> 01:30:03.198
Having a baby is a bliss. He doesn't
deserve to be any part of it.

01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:06.785
If I were you,
I would kick him so far away

01:30:06.885 --> 01:30:09.118
that even his shadow
couldn't touch that baby.

01:30:09.218 --> 01:30:11.046
Enough!

01:30:11.646 --> 01:30:15.662
25 years ago, you chased Delilah's
father away with the same attitude,

01:30:15.762 --> 01:30:20.022
and what was the result? He never
even showed up for Rachel's funeral.

01:30:20.122 --> 01:30:21.827
And who suffered the most?

01:30:23.282 --> 01:30:25.017
Delilah.

01:30:25.478 --> 01:30:29.652
This child has never even seen
her father in her entire life.

01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:32.415
I'm so sorry to bring
this up now, honey.

01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:38.372
This is not our decision to make.

01:30:44.754 --> 01:30:49.385
It's Mike. Wait, wait, please.
Let me talk to him now.

01:31:00.206 --> 01:31:02.860
- Hey, grandpa Paul.
- Hi.

01:31:22.826 --> 01:31:25.967
- I'm assuming Dylan told you.
- Yes, she told us.

01:31:28.042 --> 01:31:30.792
I just want to say I have the
highest regard for you and Elaine.

01:31:30.892 --> 01:31:33.694
I think Dylan is a wonderful,
wonderful woman.

01:31:33.794 --> 01:31:36.934
I truly love her. I really do.

01:31:37.034 --> 01:31:42.979
It's just, you know, sometimes fate
kind of plays tricks on you, and...

01:31:44.634 --> 01:31:48.441
I never thought I'd run into Alex
again in the rest of my life, but...

01:31:48.541 --> 01:31:53.214
I did, and unfortunately, it just kind of...
happened at the wrong time.

01:31:53.314 --> 01:31:55.116
What do you want from me?

01:31:57.386 --> 01:32:01.110
Dylan is not really of a sound
mind to listen to me, so...

01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:05.862
I was wondering if you could talk to
her and get her to sign these papers.

01:32:05.962 --> 01:32:10.437
If you do, we can just avoid
the whole prenup and just...

01:32:11.137 --> 01:32:12.787
Move on.

01:32:13.065 --> 01:32:15.458
My granddaughter never
cared for my advice,

01:32:15.558 --> 01:32:19.906
even when she was choosing a spouse.
But don't be discouraged.

01:32:20.006 --> 01:32:23.306
I'll do my very best to help
you out with your divorce.

01:32:23.406 --> 01:32:28.006
Living together after this
isn't good for anyone. Wait.

01:32:28.306 --> 01:32:31.384
And, you know, I will do my
best to work on the franchise.

01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:45.813
Oh. Is this the prenup?
I already have a copy.

01:32:45.913 --> 01:32:48.278
No, it's the guest list
from your wedding.

01:32:49.578 --> 01:32:51.893
- I thought you said you were gonna help me.
- I just did.

01:32:51.993 --> 01:32:56.654
I'm now officially butting
out of your lives. Good luck.

01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:08.270
Honey, you're going about
this all the wrong way.

01:33:08.370 --> 01:33:12.507
Stop thinking of this as just your
divorce and start thinking of this as a...

01:33:12.607 --> 01:33:16.154
celebration of our lives together.

01:33:16.329 --> 01:33:18.326
Start having fun
with it, and if you do,

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:22.741
then the guests will be more likely
to come. Just think about it.

01:33:22.866 --> 01:33:27.039
How many divorceÃ©s will ever
have this kind of an opportunity?

01:33:50.274 --> 01:33:51.654
Good luck.

01:34:02.438 --> 01:34:06.562
Every day, every hour you're on the road.
It's a carmaggeddon for you, dick.

01:34:06.662 --> 01:34:10.402
- Don't call him that near my school, mom!
- Be quiet. Mommy and daddy are talking.

01:34:10.502 --> 01:34:12.753
It doesn't mean you can
take away my day with him.

01:34:16.457 --> 01:34:17.581
No?

01:34:19.289 --> 01:34:20.748
No.

01:34:42.021 --> 01:34:43.837
This is hilarious!

01:34:44.337 --> 01:34:46.406
Oh, you got to accept
this funny gift.

01:34:46.506 --> 01:34:50.053
Hi. Come to my divorce.
You are coming to my divorce.

01:34:50.153 --> 01:34:52.614
Divorce ceremony.
Henley's only, okay?

01:34:52.714 --> 01:34:56.213
What the fuck? Who the fuck are you?

01:34:56.313 --> 01:34:58.626
Some high-school friend?
Some college roommate?

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:01.377
- Who the fuck is this, Brad?
- Honey, I have no idea.

01:35:01.477 --> 01:35:03.518
I swear to god, I don't even
know who this idiot is.

01:35:03.618 --> 01:35:06.406
Brad, it's me... Mike Christian.
I'm Dylan Lipnick's husband.

01:35:06.506 --> 01:35:08.549
Oh! Oh, yeah!

01:35:08.649 --> 01:35:10.790
So you do know him!

01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:14.205
- Did you just lie to me?
- I mean... I don't exactly know...

01:35:14.305 --> 01:35:16.026
Fuck you!

01:35:16.126 --> 01:35:19.793
How dare you fucking lie to
me on my fucking wedding day

01:35:19.893 --> 01:35:22.193
before my fucking honeymoon?

01:35:23.522 --> 01:35:28.359
So, a young Jewish couple
gets successfully divorced,

01:35:28.678 --> 01:35:33.578
but the wife says to the judge,
"Now I have to apply for a get."

01:35:33.678 --> 01:35:35.726
And the judge says, "Get what?"

01:35:35.826 --> 01:35:40.262
She says, "No, that's the name for a
Jewish ceremony which is for a divorce."

01:35:40.362 --> 01:35:44.414
And he says, "Oh, I understand.
In other words, you mean like a bris."

01:35:44.514 --> 01:35:47.653
She says, "Yes, except that
in a bris, it's one thing.

01:35:47.753 --> 01:35:50.754
In a get, you get to get rid
of the entire schmuck."

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:58.214
Hey, there. You and me... divorce
ceremony. Thanks. Come here.

01:35:59.402 --> 01:36:01.830
Look what he brings me...
a divorce invitation.

01:36:06.409 --> 01:36:10.401
Hi. I would like to
invite you to my divorce.

01:36:10.701 --> 01:36:12.710
Is it true you're actually
seeking a divorce from Dylan?

01:36:13.194 --> 01:36:14.283
No comment.

01:36:26.846 --> 01:36:29.382
You are coming to
my divorce. Be there.

01:36:29.482 --> 01:36:31.682
Hey, Paul and Amber.

01:36:32.298 --> 01:36:34.795
Divorce invitation.
I'll see you there, okay?

01:36:41.226 --> 01:36:44.293
Oh, my god! It's Mike!
Oh, my god! Mike!

01:36:44.393 --> 01:36:46.490
I'm so happy you're here! I was
hoping that you were gonna come.

01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:48.774
I saw you on the cover of that
one magazine. Is this for me?

01:36:48.874 --> 01:36:51.030
You're coming to my divorce.
See you there.

01:36:52.137 --> 01:36:54.886
I think I'm gonna bring a plus-one because
I didn't bring anyone the last time.

01:36:54.986 --> 01:36:57.602
Joseph Armstrong in the house!

01:36:57.702 --> 01:36:59.261
That's because there wasn't
an open bar, but this time,

01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:00.773
I think there's going to be.
You know what I mean?

01:37:00.973 --> 01:37:03.052
And I'm done! That's it!

01:37:43.761 --> 01:37:45.814
According to the
prenuptial agreement,

01:37:46.565 --> 01:37:49.998
it is incumbent upon the person
who initiated the divorce

01:37:50.566 --> 01:37:54.855
to invite all of those who attended the
original wedding... minus 10 percent.

01:37:58.729 --> 01:38:01.374
Mr. Christian has done
this successfully.

01:38:01.674 --> 01:38:04.106
As decreed in the
prenuptial agreement,

01:38:04.206 --> 01:38:07.479
Mrs. Christian must sign
the divorce petition.

01:38:20.230 --> 01:38:21.748
Well...

01:38:22.565 --> 01:38:26.837
It feels weird to be offering
congratulations to you, Mike.

01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:28.999
I didn't think you could pull it off.

01:38:29.974 --> 01:38:32.129
I have...

01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:36.345
never had such a strong bond
with anyone as I have with you.

01:38:38.506 --> 01:38:41.399
I have never been so in love.

01:38:44.234 --> 01:38:48.760
And I thought you felt the same way.
I guess I was wrong.

01:38:51.246 --> 01:38:53.829
In the past few weeks,
I've seen how much trouble

01:38:53.929 --> 01:38:57.347
Mike has gone through to
get all of you here today.

01:38:58.249 --> 01:39:03.508
He has shown tremendous
persistence to end this marriage

01:39:03.608 --> 01:39:05.891
and unite with Alex.

01:39:07.833 --> 01:39:10.277
Maybe that means she
deserves him more than I do.

01:39:31.982 --> 01:39:34.248
And now, according to the
prenuptial agreement...

01:39:35.437 --> 01:39:40.059
Mr. Christian will reveal
his reasons for a divorce.

01:39:54.285 --> 01:39:56.056
Thank you, Dylan.

01:39:56.905 --> 01:40:01.805
And thank you, all, for coming today
and sparing your valuable time for me.

01:40:02.817 --> 01:40:05.765
Getting all you here was no easy task,
I can assure you that.

01:40:06.265 --> 01:40:09.489
It was no fun having doors
slammed in my face,

01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:11.956
getting the evil eye on the street,

01:40:12.456 --> 01:40:14.669
being spat upon, punched in the face,

01:40:14.769 --> 01:40:19.094
and told I am a horrible person
for deserting my pregnant wife.

01:40:20.757 --> 01:40:24.850
This little... event was not my idea.

01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:29.388
It all happened because Dylan slipped
a little clause in our prenup...

01:40:30.388 --> 01:40:32.133
a clause I never bothered to read.

01:40:32.233 --> 01:40:35.129
Otherwise, I never would have
had to face this shit storm

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:39.931
and see all of you, but I did.
And today, I am a winner...

01:40:43.166 --> 01:40:45.925
A winner not just because
I got my way, but...

01:40:46.725 --> 01:40:51.145
because I made the journey.
I followed through on this.

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:54.042
It was a journey of meeting people,

01:40:54.616 --> 01:40:56.480
talking with them,

01:40:56.656 --> 01:40:59.364
reasoning with some,
arguing with others,

01:40:59.964 --> 01:41:02.401
listening to their pains,
their turmoils,

01:41:02.501 --> 01:41:05.217
their successes, their failures,

01:41:05.317 --> 01:41:08.792
their mistakes and their regrets...

01:41:11.154 --> 01:41:13.120
their life lessons.

01:41:16.045 --> 01:41:19.389
Now, I was mad at Dylan for
making me come here today.

01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:23.602
I thought she was a selfish,
stubborn woman...

01:41:24.421 --> 01:41:29.112
Until I ran into a single mom with
five kids who asked me a question.

01:41:29.212 --> 01:41:33.298
She said, "What if Dylan
had instigated the divorce?

01:41:34.198 --> 01:41:36.745
Would she have to go
through the same hell?"

01:41:36.845 --> 01:41:39.753
So, I read the prenup again, and...

01:41:39.853 --> 01:41:43.183
sure as shit, she'd have to go
through the same hell I did.

01:41:43.554 --> 01:41:48.027
That's when I realized that this
clause wasn't evil after all.

01:41:50.025 --> 01:41:53.268
It was fair... to both of us.

01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:56.249
And it was fair to our unborn
child that the parents

01:41:56.349 --> 01:41:58.351
aren't gonna just walk
away from each other.

01:41:59.017 --> 01:42:02.150
I realized that this...
this long journey that I had to take

01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:06.623
was the perfect counseling for
a torn, confused man like me.

01:42:09.833 --> 01:42:12.063
When I put on this suit today,

01:42:12.163 --> 01:42:14.676
I was reminded how I
felt on my wedding day.

01:42:19.849 --> 01:42:22.325
I've been thinking a lot about
the word "love" lately.

01:42:22.925 --> 01:42:25.313
Love is a...

01:42:25.413 --> 01:42:28.326
Powerful emotion.

01:42:28.522 --> 01:42:30.401
Love is this...

01:42:30.501 --> 01:42:33.966
indescribable feeling you
get when you see someone

01:42:34.066 --> 01:42:36.531
who you know will do
anything for you...

01:42:37.102 --> 01:42:40.213
When you see someone with a life

01:42:40.313 --> 01:42:44.026
growing inside of them,
a life you helped create.

01:42:50.057 --> 01:42:51.890
Love is sticking it out.

01:42:52.713 --> 01:42:55.198
Living with someone day after day,

01:42:55.617 --> 01:42:59.125
waking up next to them every
morning with their bad breath

01:42:59.257 --> 01:43:01.225
and their hair matted to
one side of their head,

01:43:01.325 --> 01:43:03.621
and you just look at
them and you think,

01:43:07.337 --> 01:43:09.186
"God, she's beautiful."

01:43:12.573 --> 01:43:14.108
That's love.

01:43:15.945 --> 01:43:19.088
Dylan, I've given you every
reason not to love me...

01:43:20.297 --> 01:43:22.484
And only one reason to.

01:43:24.713 --> 01:43:26.012
I love you.

01:43:28.553 --> 01:43:30.053
You once said to me, you said,

01:43:31.253 --> 01:43:34.416
if only your thesis could
change one person...

01:43:37.705 --> 01:43:38.894
It did.

01:43:46.705 --> 01:43:48.440
I'm sorry, Alex.

01:43:56.525 --> 01:43:58.626
I have to do this.

01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:06.864
So, in front of all of you...

01:44:10.993 --> 01:44:13.746
I am begging you, Dylan,

01:44:14.445 --> 01:44:17.871
to please forgive me for all the
pain that I have caused you.

01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:24.599
Dylan, will you remarry me?

01:44:26.346 --> 01:44:27.951
Yes!

01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:31.678
Yes, but...

01:44:32.973 --> 01:44:34.753
You're gonna have to work for it.

01:44:35.777 --> 01:44:36.837
I promise.

01:45:15.341 --> 01:45:16.511
Mazel Tov!

01:45:49.513 --> 01:45:52.420
All right, now listen up! Now...

01:45:52.745 --> 01:45:56.629
- All of you who had sex last night...
- Yeah!

01:45:56.729 --> 01:46:00.690
Let's go! Step up!
Get your picture ta... oh!

01:46:02.973 --> 01:46:05.957
Couple late bloomers.
Couple late bloomers. Okay, okay.

01:46:10.605 --> 01:46:13.551
No kissing and telling, buddy.
All right, now...

01:46:14.377 --> 01:46:18.199
Those of you who had
sex with the groom!

01:46:19.337 --> 01:46:21.296
Somebody got to be in with the groom!

01:46:22.305 --> 01:46:25.413
- Sorry, Dylan. Oh!
- Okay, mama.

01:46:25.513 --> 01:46:26.994
Yeah, come here.

01:46:30.473 --> 01:46:32.005
Thanks for playing.

01:46:32.205 --> 01:46:37.667
All right, now, those of you
who were screwed by the groom.

01:46:37.961 --> 01:46:39.437
Yeah!

01:46:40.905 --> 01:46:43.653
Pick your head up, buddy.
Pick your head up, buddy. Come on.

01:46:43.753 --> 01:46:45.972
Smile about it. It's a celebration.

01:46:46.645 --> 01:46:49.593
All right. All right. A good sport.

01:46:49.693 --> 01:46:52.077
Now, those of you...

01:46:52.177 --> 01:46:56.083
Who screwed the groom,
big-time. Somebody did.

01:47:02.759 --> 01:47:04.181
Okay, all right.

01:47:05.193 --> 01:47:08.605
- Hurted me more than it hurted you.
- Might need some counseling on that one.

01:47:08.705 --> 01:47:12.280
All right, now, those of you,
who, unfortunately...

01:47:13.433 --> 01:47:16.197
saw the groom butt naked
having sex. That was us!

01:47:16.597 --> 01:47:19.261
That was us! Get in there.

01:47:19.561 --> 01:47:21.661
- You know what?
- Michael... don't touch him.

01:47:21.761 --> 01:47:23.325
Stay away from him.
Stay away from him.

01:47:23.425 --> 01:47:26.757
All right, now, those of you...

01:47:26.857 --> 01:47:31.645
Who would like to go on a honeymoon
with the groom, come on down!

01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:35.077
- Yeah, see? She wants to go.
- Here they... boy, they... oh!

01:47:35.177 --> 01:47:38.517
- I'm starting to think something here.
- You love it. And once you go Mike,

01:47:38.617 --> 01:47:40.509
you don't go anywhere else.

01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:44.645
- There something you want to tell me?
- No. No, there's nothing. There is nothing.

01:47:44.745 --> 01:47:46.053
Okay, just making sure.

01:47:46.153 --> 01:47:50.265
Last but certainly not least...
I feel like we all want to do this...

01:47:50.665 --> 01:47:54.221
who wants to go on a
honeymoon with the bride?

01:47:54.321 --> 01:47:57.197
That's all of you! That's everybody!

01:47:57.297 --> 01:48:01.205
- That's all of you! You're kidding me!
- No! She is mine! No! She's mine!

01:48:01.305 --> 01:48:03.397
No! Absolutely not!

01:48:06.225 --> 01:48:08.025
Get it, man!
