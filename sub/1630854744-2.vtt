WEBVTT

01:08.861 --> 01:09.945
Thanks, Daddy.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.947
Hey, Ree.

01:14.825 --> 01:15.826
Hey, Pop.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.124
A mother should never outlive her child.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.296
Hey, Charise. I'm sorry.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.798
Hey, have you and Eva spoken
since that night?

01:32.134 --> 01:34.344
Says she got a tip Drea was at the motel.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.429
Went looking for her.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.849
A tip. How convenient.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.559
What do you know?

01:41.268 --> 01:44.188
ME said Drea was strangled.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.858
That's a terrible death.
-Yeah, there's more.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.612
Indications of recent sexual partners.
Plural.

01:52.696 --> 01:53.780
What are you thinking?

01:56.575 --> 01:58.493
Two-handed strangulation isn't easy.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.662
Takes enough time, strength, and malice

02:00.662 --> 02:03.123
for an attacker to really think about
what they're doing.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.711
So whoever did this wanted her to suffer.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.803
I am being pulled back onto Emily Mills.
I'm gonna sneak you out the side.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.013
Wha--

02:18.013 --> 02:22.017
Look, I am pushing as hard as I can
to get more resources for Drea,

02:22.017 --> 02:23.852
but until someone starts talking,

02:24.603 --> 02:26.355
it's gonna be hard to find out any more.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.273
Which is why we can't let up on Eva.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.194
How does she always know the right person
to talk to or the right place to show up?

02:33.278 --> 02:35.155
That's what I keep asking about you.

02:49.253 --> 02:50.754
She's been dodging me.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.676
I was lucky to know her.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.096
It is such a shame. Such a shame.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.099
Drea knew she was loved.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.559
Remember that.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.854
You did everything you could
for your daughter.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.773
She can't say the same about you.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.444
If you had paid attention to Drea
instead of blondie last year,

03:14.444 --> 03:16.071
maybe we wouldn't be here.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.156
And what did you do for Drea?

03:20.242 --> 03:22.995
Yeah, it's easy to talk,
but not so easy to act, now is it?

03:24.454 --> 03:26.582
We all got a story
about how we could've done more,

03:26.582 --> 03:31.336
but failure to act, that's still failure.

03:37.801 --> 03:41.972
Well, you're the last person
I expected to defend me.

03:41.972 --> 03:46.810
Especially after I pushed Aames
to interrogate you.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.480
Death makes us all act irrationally.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.191
I still have questions.

03:52.191 --> 03:55.194
I said everything I needed to say
to your guy, Aames.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.780
Or could you not hear me
through the mirror?

04:03.952 --> 04:04.953
Hey.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.415
I have enough on my plate

04:08.415 --> 04:12.002
explaining to my kids how one
of their fellow students overdosed.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.004
I don't owe you anything.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.466
Drea was murdered, Eva.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.675
Strangled.

04:19.510 --> 04:23.180
And I'll make sure whoever did it
pays for that a thousand times over.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.601
Don't you wanna be on the right side
of that crusade?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.065
A student lives in that motel.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.568
It's transient housing.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.197
I check in on her and her dad.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.910
Why couldn't you just tell Aames that?

04:48.747 --> 04:51.667
You were protecting your student.
-Her family's not here legally.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.711
Poppy, I am on the right side of this.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.632
She told me more and more young girls
have been there.

04:59.216 --> 05:04.388
She admitted to seeing Drea a few times,
including that night.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.765
I just got there too late.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.092
Hey.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.558
Man, I feel like using.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.312
You've come so far, Charise.
-If you wanna go to a meeting,

06:36.355 --> 06:37.606
I'll go with you.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.234
Whatever you need.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.821
Nothing we do on this side
can bring back who we lost.

06:45.405 --> 06:51.328
But what we do going forward may help us
get back a piece of ourselves.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.834
Do you mind if we take a look around?

06:58.001 --> 07:03.257
We think Drea may have received some gifts
from her trafficker.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.094
Maybe one of them can provide us
with an identity--

07:07.094 --> 07:08.428
Do what you need to do.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.765
Okay.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.341
Markus.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.013
What's up?

07:54.516 --> 08:00.230
I used to hide things in a vent
during my time away.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.692
Privacy was a rare luxury.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.466
Burner phone.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.136
Drea deleted her text history.

08:35.724 --> 08:36.975
Is this Questeur?

08:39.144 --> 08:41.188
Aren't kids using this app
to talk these days?

08:41.188 --> 08:45.651
But Trini told me that Questeur's
like Snapchat's dirty cousin.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.903
DMs are a haven for bad behavior.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.322
Drugs, prostitution, you name it.

08:50.322 --> 08:54.535
Usernames are encrypted,
and messages, they just disappear.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.169
Hey, hey.

09:04.169 --> 09:10.592
Drea was communicating
with users like "IRX4YOU, BUNNYHOP,

09:10.592 --> 09:13.595
DJayHustle, Bottom2TopEnergy."

09:13.595 --> 09:15.097
I bet those were her johns.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.182
And you think
one of them might have killed her?

09:17.182 --> 09:18.600
It's possible.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.271
It has been eight days
since the disappearance

09:22.271 --> 09:24.314
of Piedmont teen Emily Mills.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.985
Oakland Police Lieutenant
Daniel Fostokowski told Channel 13 News

09:27.985 --> 09:33.490
that "not one officer in the Bay
will sleep until Emily is home safe."

09:37.369 --> 09:40.539
I know you're in the zone, Pop,
but let me know if you need anything.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.832
It's okay.

09:42.374 --> 09:46.211
Markus is just in the other room
putting together intel from Aames.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.755
Markus can't be here full-time.
You need help.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.427
If this is you pitching yourself,
you should know this is a tough job.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.054
Producer, reporter, fact-checker.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.389
Not for the faint of heart.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.183
And being a city bus driver is?

09:59.766 --> 10:03.020
Cydie, I can't take any chances
on you right now. I'm sorry.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.022
Well, thanks for all your support.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.317
Hey.
-Yeah, what's good?

10:10.194 --> 10:12.070
What's baby sis up in arms about?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.406
Filling in for Noa. I shut it down.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.409
Any help with Questeur?
-Not really.

10:17.910 --> 10:23.290
You know, the founder, Lee Hackman,
he won't budge on user privacy.

10:23.290 --> 10:27.503
Worse than that, OPD recovered
next to nothing in that motel room.

10:29.087 --> 10:33.091
Sex and strangulation
should've produced more leads.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.136
Not if you don't care enough to find them.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.513
I'm telling you, Poppy,

10:38.013 --> 10:41.141
the Department's just gonna write her off
as another dead prostitute.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.564
Well, OPD has left us with no choice

10:47.564 --> 10:49.650
but to do our own digging
at the crime scene.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.112
I thought Aames said
nobody at the motel was talking.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.031
Not to OPD.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.005
There he is.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.508
I ain't dead yet.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.760
Respect few, fear none.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.388
Capstones for life.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.141
My brother.
-My brother.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.977
Come on. Rest yourself.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.816
We got your favorite today.
-I don't want nothing.

11:30.816 --> 11:31.984
Thanks, Herbie.

11:31.984 --> 11:33.694
Appetite ain't been right
since the stroke.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.281
I don't see the point anyway.
-Point is they damn good.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.324
I made the rub myself. Come on, man.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.998
Ain't heard from you in a minute.
What's going on?

11:46.915 --> 11:50.127
The girl, Drea Spivey,
the Capstones rescued a few months back,

11:50.878 --> 11:51.879
she's dead.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.965
How?
-Strangled,

11:55.841 --> 11:59.011
possibly through forced prostitution.
She was 16.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.348
You did your duty and brought her home.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.603
Wasn't your job to keep her home.
-Maybe it should've been.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.648
Instead of being janitors
and cleaning up messes,

12:11.648 --> 12:14.067
why don't the Capstones
get on the offensive?

12:14.568 --> 12:18.363
Take a more pivotal role in the community
to keep people safe.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.408
Up the patrols and put the fear of God
into this new criminal element

12:21.408 --> 12:22.492
that's flooding this city.

12:23.452 --> 12:27.080
We've tried versions of this before.
-Not with real support. Look.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.334
I might have some political weight now.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.544
One of the mayoral candidates,
the front-runner

12:32.544 --> 12:34.630
by the name of Andrew Finney
reached out to talk.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.590
Now with his cosign,

12:37.758 --> 12:40.219
there is no limits
to how far the Capstones can reach.

12:42.221 --> 12:47.726
"Now there rules a new king over Egypt
who did not know Joseph."

12:48.936 --> 12:50.229
Times are different.

12:50.229 --> 12:51.897
People wanna help Oakland, not destroy it.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.440
Who's to say they're different?

12:53.440 --> 12:57.778
You accept the temptation of
asserting your power in the name of good,

12:58.862 --> 13:00.614
the trail of blood and violence
will follow.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.449
This is the move, Agathia.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.826
I did the same all my life.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.620
Now look at me.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.248
Can't even breathe on my own.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.251
Thought I had more time.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.297
How's your health these days?

13:24.096 --> 13:27.182
When people demand
to meet with their boss,

13:27.182 --> 13:29.142
it's usually somewhere cushy.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.478
Well, 1:00 p.m. is prime cutting time.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.273
Act natural.
-Ladies, hi.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.860
Would you like to explain to the
superintendent why you're out of class?

13:38.902 --> 13:41.989
I have a dentist appointment.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.158
And you're what? Moral support?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.871
Both of you to my office now.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.915
I wanna ask you some questions
about Drea Spivey.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.960
Today, ladies. Let's go.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.005
See, I told you it wasn't gonna work.
And my parents are gonna kill me.

13:58.005 --> 14:02.593
Clearly, my request for school security
needs to be a priority.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.761
Before we get to that,

14:05.971 --> 14:09.433
I don't think it's a good idea to
be playing detective with your students.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.895
One of our students was murdered.
-At a motel.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.314
That's not school property,
so it's not a school problem.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.900
So a dead student is not a school problem?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.652
I don't like you scaring students.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.197
And I especially don't like the optics

14:23.197 --> 14:26.742
of hosting services for a prostitute
on school grounds.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.785
Students can mourn on their own time.

14:34.333 --> 14:38.420
Children cannot be prostitutes.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.882
Children are too young
to consent to sex work.

14:43.634 --> 14:47.554
Drea is a victim, sir.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.607
Mom was a Marvin fan?

14:59.608 --> 15:02.903
She used to sing you girls
Marvin and Tammi instead of lullabies.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.697
Thanks for sharing these.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.366
Look.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.118
I was the cutest.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.204
What?
-Take whatever you want.

15:12.204 --> 15:15.415
I need to get rid of everything
before I head to the Vineyard.

15:17.960 --> 15:22.297
I must say, I was surprised
that you agreed to host me,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.717
given that you renounced the Parnell name.

15:27.553 --> 15:32.599
Well, reclaiming my father's name
is in no way a repudiation of my mother.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.351
Easy to say with her in the next life.

15:35.269 --> 15:37.521
I wonder what she'd have thought
about your choice.

15:38.939 --> 15:42.025
I think she'd be more concerned
at how you'd feed Cydie and me

15:42.025 --> 15:45.946
after your kids, yourself,
and your damn dogs when we lived with you.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.288
On second thought,

15:55.205 --> 15:58.375
I think I will have a cup of tea.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.586
Where is your kitchen again?

16:00.586 --> 16:04.548
Straight to the back. Help yourself.
-Thank you. Appreciate it.

16:07.676 --> 16:11.305
Something must be happening
to make our family peacemaker go rogue.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.225
I'm late.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.271
I think I'm pregnant.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.440
Des.
-Oh, my G--

16:21.440 --> 16:23.317
Nando is not gonna be involved.

16:24.568 --> 16:25.986
Are you okay with that?

16:26.778 --> 16:27.779
Well--

16:29.740 --> 16:32.618
I always thought in order to be a mom,

16:32.618 --> 16:37.581
I needed a partner, the right kind
of house, a savings account.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.958
I don't have any of it.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.588
But something still seems right.

16:46.131 --> 16:49.635
Like this is exactly
the way it needed to happen.

16:49.635 --> 16:50.719
So...

16:52.304 --> 16:53.722
I guess it's okay.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.433
But also terrifying.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.563
Well, who needs a partner
when you got sisters?

17:03.148 --> 17:04.650
I was made to be an auntie.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.693
I'm thrilled for you, Dee.

17:07.903 --> 17:08.904
Thank you, Poppy.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.405
A little baby.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.866
Oh, shoot. I need to go.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.117
Look, I need y'all
to keep an eye on Leona.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.496
I don't want her snooping around my house.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.338
Yeah, I just took the police tape down.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.966
Good. That means
the room hasn't been disturbed.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.802
Yeah, it's a mess. But y'all ain't five-o.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.429
So if y'all wanna get in there,
y'all gotta pay like everybody else.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.681
How much?

17:38.183 --> 17:41.186
I'm thinking five racks.
-Man, just give us the key to the room.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.146
What you gonna do, old school?

17:44.147 --> 17:45.566
I know your local MC.

17:46.275 --> 17:49.319
This neighborhood has to abide
by the Capstones code,

17:49.319 --> 17:51.154
no underage prostitution.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.783
We keeping two eyes
on East 14th Street going forward.

17:56.368 --> 17:59.162
There's been a lot of new bucks
that been running the blade here lately.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.332
You see, they got paper
and they don't answer to no code.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.625
Neither do I.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.627
So get the fuck out of here, grandpa,

18:05.627 --> 18:08.005
before I put you in a fucking box
a year or two early.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.050
Take a walk.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.135
Daddy.

18:16.555 --> 18:17.556
Come on.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.854
Do you know about
the pharaoh who did not know Joseph?

18:25.647 --> 18:27.983
And do you know what he said
to the people of Israel?

18:30.027 --> 18:33.780
He said, "Let us deal shrewdly with them."

18:34.948 --> 18:38.285
But the people of Israel would not endure
such reckless behavior forever.

18:38.869 --> 18:39.912
Fu--

18:41.622 --> 18:43.207
Come on, man. Let it go!

18:45.459 --> 18:46.460
Fuck.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.258
All right, man! You got it! Let--

19:26.124 --> 19:28.210
You spend much time on the blade
with the OPD?

19:28.794 --> 19:29.795
Yeah.

19:29.795 --> 19:32.381
Enough to sear
a lifetime of images in my brain

19:32.381 --> 19:33.924
that I wish that I could forget.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.052
Maybe we could find
Drea's old crew down there.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.471
Somebody must've seen her before she died.

19:41.098 --> 19:44.226
It could help us retrace her steps.
-Uh-huh, you might be right.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.688
Maybe we could get lucky and I could talk
to some of those young bucks

19:47.688 --> 19:49.690
that Raphael was so geeked up about.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.359
Yeah.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.004
Hey, hey. I got something.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.675
What is it?
-I don't know.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.385
It's like a needle or something.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.596
I'm gonna send these pictures to Aames.

20:21.889 --> 20:24.099
He should know
OPD maybe missed some evidence

20:24.099 --> 20:26.810
and send somebody out here to collect it.
-It wouldn't be the first time

20:26.810 --> 20:29.062
they missed some evidence
in this neighborhood.

20:29.062 --> 20:33.483
But I'm telling you right now,
chain of custody could be a problem.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.652
What else is new?

20:43.535 --> 20:44.536
Markus.

20:45.579 --> 20:46.580
What's up?

20:47.539 --> 20:50.375
Isn't that the same logo
from Drea's matchbook?

20:53.795 --> 20:54.963
Come on. Let's go.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.110
Working girls.

21:27.579 --> 21:28.914
We have a little interest.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.959
Listen, I'm just gonna hang back,
all right?

21:31.959 --> 21:33.126
I don't wanna scare 'em.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.254
I doubt these girls scare easily.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.301
Hi, ladies.

21:42.511 --> 21:43.512
I'm Poppy.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.349
How are the fries?
-They're fine.

21:49.268 --> 21:51.895
Maybe I can get you another round?
-We're all good over here, mama.

21:52.563 --> 21:54.314
So why don't you tell us
what you really want?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.483
Direct.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.776
Okay.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.781
Did any of you know this girl?

22:03.282 --> 22:04.533
Drea Spivey.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.454
She was found dead in a motel room.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.665
Strangled.

22:13.417 --> 22:16.503
I'm not trying to get you
to make a statement or anything

22:16.503 --> 22:17.796
or get on the witness stand.

22:17.796 --> 22:20.883
I'm just a family friend
looking for justice.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.759
She was only 16.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.974
We found messages from Drea's johns.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.602
Did you know any of her regulars?

22:34.271 --> 22:36.356
Well, I've seen--
-I'm sorry for your loss.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.609
And for the shade.

22:39.443 --> 22:42.070
We just gotta be careful
about who we talk to on the track.

22:43.155 --> 22:46.200
I understand. What's your name?

22:46.200 --> 22:47.492
Rochelle.

22:48.452 --> 22:49.453
Rochelle.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.580
But Drea wasn't part of our crew.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.540
She kept to herself on the street, right?

22:55.167 --> 22:56.251
But come to think of it,

22:57.336 --> 22:59.379
there was some dude
who used to pick her up.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.965
He was here just a few nights back.
-Tuesday?

23:02.716 --> 23:04.843
Yeah.
-That was the night she was murdered.

23:05.886 --> 23:07.513
Do you remember anything about him?

23:08.931 --> 23:12.351
He had one of those corny vanity plates.

23:12.351 --> 23:15.395
Something like IRX4YOU.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.068
Let's go, y'all.
Scared money don't make money.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.446
Thanks.

23:28.492 --> 23:29.993
Y'all be careful out there now.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.037
Will do.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.589
I heard what they said.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.299
I'll have Korpa run the plate.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.182
This one's from Austria.

23:52.766 --> 23:55.352
We pick a different ski chalet
every winter.

23:55.936 --> 23:58.397
This year was Emily's turn to choose.

23:58.397 --> 24:00.858
She wanted to do Courchevel.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.277
It's France.

24:04.111 --> 24:07.489
Right. Well, hopefully
we can get you all back there soon.

24:09.199 --> 24:11.451
We thought these photos
could go out with the reward.

24:12.494 --> 24:17.666
Remind whoever has her
that she's just a child

24:18.876 --> 24:20.711
with a family that loves her dearly.

24:22.713 --> 24:24.548
Is there any news on the case?

24:25.215 --> 24:28.010
There's still no signs
she's been trafficked.

24:28.010 --> 24:33.473
However, we found a stripped Land Rover
at a Fruitvale parking garage.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.101
The VIN number's a match for Emily's.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.562
There was some blood on the driver's seat.

24:38.562 --> 24:40.147
I'm sorry to say,

24:40.147 --> 24:43.358
that was also your daughter's--
your stepdaughter's.

24:43.358 --> 24:47.905
Oh, God. Is there a-a bathroom?
-Yeah. Just--

24:48.488 --> 24:49.907
Hallway, to your left.
-Yeah.

24:53.702 --> 24:57.873
Was there any other evidence
to identify whoever took her?

24:59.082 --> 25:00.083
Not yet.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.339
We're losing our chance
at bringing her home, aren't we?

25:05.339 --> 25:09.051
As long as there is a chance,
I will keep looking, okay?

25:11.720 --> 25:15.682
Joana, in traumatic cases like these,

25:15.682 --> 25:21.063
sometimes the family needs a few days
for the shock to settle down

25:21.063 --> 25:24.358
and for the memories to kick in.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.235
What kind of memories?

25:29.196 --> 25:32.241
Is there anyone who might wish you harm?

25:33.909 --> 25:38.497
A work colleague, an old acquaintance,
an especially bitter ex?

25:38.497 --> 25:40.207
No one comes to mind beyond Victor.

25:41.834 --> 25:42.835
Victor?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.713
I assumed
that Peter mentioned him earlier.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.008
No.

25:51.134 --> 25:56.390
Victor Ignas was Peter's business partner
in a tech start-up about eight years ago.

25:57.766 --> 26:00.310
Peter got out. Sold his shares.

26:00.811 --> 26:02.563
Let Victor run it on his own.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.772
To great success?

26:06.191 --> 26:07.442
Straight to bankruptcy.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.820
He hasn't spoken to Peter since.

26:12.406 --> 26:13.407
Okay.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.187
Hey, baby.
-Hey.

26:44.688 --> 26:45.856
How you feeling?

26:47.566 --> 26:49.067
What are you doing?

26:49.067 --> 26:50.402
Let me get that for you.

26:50.402 --> 26:52.446
You look like a helpless little turtle.

26:54.239 --> 26:57.451
I mean, a majestic Amazon woman preparing
to bear my child,

26:57.451 --> 26:59.536
making me the luckiest man in the world.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.163
You may proceed. Thank you.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.957
Now rest those dogs,
I know they're barking.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.125
Yes.

27:06.335 --> 27:07.836
Thank you.
-You're welcome, baby.

27:07.836 --> 27:08.921
God.

27:09.755 --> 27:11.715
We had a heartbreaking premie today.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.259
This poor mother,
she went into early labor

27:14.259 --> 27:16.762
after her husband shoved her into a table.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.014
She wouldn't even press charges.

27:19.973 --> 27:25.062
Baby, like we said before,
you don't need to go back to that place.

27:25.062 --> 27:27.105
Markus, please don't.
-What?

27:27.648 --> 27:31.485
I mean, we finally have enough money
for you to quit. Let me spoil you.

27:31.485 --> 27:34.863
No, I need my own life and my own career.

27:34.863 --> 27:36.406
You need that right this second?

27:36.406 --> 27:39.243
Markus, when we split
and I was a single mom with no income?

27:40.160 --> 27:41.453
I'm not doing that again.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.331
It's never gonna happen again.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.625
That's what people say
when things are good.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.673
All right, I understand. I do.

27:52.673 --> 27:53.841
That being said,

27:55.092 --> 27:58.428
I have been entertaining
these lurid fantasies of canceling dinner.

28:00.430 --> 28:02.683
I was looking forward
to that lasagna of yours.

28:02.683 --> 28:05.269
Even if you do make it with that
nasty-ass hippie cheese that doesn't melt.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.020
I just got home. You were--

28:08.564 --> 28:09.982
Me, what?

28:09.982 --> 28:13.443
Aubrey's gonna be here in an hour.
Trini is gonna be so mad at us.

28:13.944 --> 28:15.779
Oh, my gosh.
-Stop worrying about it.

28:15.779 --> 28:18.991
Look, just, we'll throw
some settlement money at the problem.

28:19.533 --> 28:21.243
Priority and Postmates that shit.

28:21.994 --> 28:23.078
Trini's never gonna know.

28:23.996 --> 28:26.206
Make yourself useful.
Toss a salad, something.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.126
Yes, dear.

28:32.671 --> 28:35.090
So who forgot to cook this time?

28:36.842 --> 28:39.261
Blame pregnancy brain, it's a thing.

28:40.012 --> 28:42.723
I'm not complaining.
-And what's his excuse?

28:43.932 --> 28:46.560
Tone.
-Sorry, Daddy.

28:47.603 --> 28:48.604
It's all right, baby.

28:48.604 --> 28:50.939
To tell you the truth,
the day's been weighing on me.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.525
I'm helping Poppy investigate
Drea Spivey's murder.

28:54.693 --> 28:55.861
Have you found any leads?

28:57.029 --> 28:58.238
Did you know her, Aubrey?

28:58.739 --> 29:01.241
We had a few classes together way back

29:01.241 --> 29:03.952
but drifted once she started hanging
with that drug crowd.

29:04.745 --> 29:05.954
Look, I--

29:06.455 --> 29:09.833
I get how important independence is
at your age.

29:10.959 --> 29:14.129
But independence in Oakland
can require a deal with the devil.

29:14.129 --> 29:15.464
That's right.

29:16.215 --> 29:17.508
And he always collects.

29:18.425 --> 29:21.637
Don't worry, sir.
Trini here is the smartest girl I know.

29:23.055 --> 29:24.848
Big brain would never do anything--
-Cool?

29:25.349 --> 29:27.100
I was gonna say reckless.

29:28.727 --> 29:30.395
She's always been like that.

29:30.896 --> 29:32.731
She's our perfect number one.

29:32.731 --> 29:35.734
Number two's got a lot to live up to.
-And he does.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.404
But you know that, Aubrey.

29:39.404 --> 29:41.156
Yeah, of course.
-Isn't she great?

29:41.156 --> 29:43.033
She's the greatest. She's the best.

29:55.170 --> 29:58.507
It started taking more and more
for me to reach the Garden,

29:59.466 --> 30:02.803
like the more I needed to escape,
the further away it seemed to be.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.556
An elusive Eden.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.433
What did you need to escape from?

30:12.896 --> 30:16.024
I remember one time
I saw the Japanese Gardens again.

30:16.608 --> 30:17.943
I was so relieved.

30:18.944 --> 30:21.113
But when I finally reached them,
they were--

30:21.613 --> 30:24.491
Everything was brown and dying.

30:25.534 --> 30:26.535
I couldn't breathe.

30:27.953 --> 30:31.748
When I stopped tripping,
I was covered in sweat, vomit.

30:33.584 --> 30:34.626
No one around.

30:35.794 --> 30:37.212
They had just left me there.

30:45.345 --> 30:48.056
Maybe there is no Eden
for someone like me.

30:53.687 --> 30:55.272
Maybe we can't be saved.

31:17.753 --> 31:20.797
Mom, knocking doesn't count
if you don't wait for a response.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.509
Too late.
I've already breached the fortress.

31:23.509 --> 31:26.428
Now onto the citadel.
-Okay.

31:26.428 --> 31:28.055
Get me in this bed, child.

31:28.055 --> 31:30.807
Fine.
-Wow. Goodness.

31:31.934 --> 31:33.143
Dinner went well, right?

31:34.353 --> 31:35.479
Sure.

31:36.104 --> 31:39.316
Well, I think it went great.
That boy is clearly crazy about you.

31:41.235 --> 31:42.736
Yeah, he is.

31:44.530 --> 31:45.864
How could you tell?

31:45.864 --> 31:49.284
Did he say something? Like, what was it?
-He didn't need to.

31:49.284 --> 31:53.956
It's the way that he looks at you,
and doesn't care who sees.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.377
Stop.
-Sto-- Come on.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.421
I can't.

32:02.673 --> 32:03.674
No, I u--

32:03.674 --> 32:07.886
I used to actually, like,
feel him, like, watching me at school.

32:07.886 --> 32:10.305
You know? Not in a creepy way but...

32:11.348 --> 32:15.561
And I assumed
he was looking past me, at someone else,

32:15.561 --> 32:18.981
someone more, you know?

32:19.481 --> 32:22.067
But there was only me.

32:24.987 --> 32:27.573
And then finally,
one day I snapped at him,

32:27.573 --> 32:29.491
and I asked what the problem was,

32:29.491 --> 32:34.913
and he said his only problem was figuring
out how to stop being intimidated

32:34.913 --> 32:36.623
by me long enough to ask me out.

32:39.168 --> 32:43.922
Can you imagine? Him intimidated by me.

32:46.842 --> 32:47.843
Mom?

33:07.946 --> 33:09.656
Agatha Christie once wrote,

33:11.116 --> 33:15.454
"A mother's love for her child is
like nothing else in the world.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.624
It knows no law, no pity.

33:19.791 --> 33:21.418
It dares all things

33:21.418 --> 33:26.924
and crushes down remorselessly
all that stands in its path."

33:27.966 --> 33:31.637
Yet, despite the best efforts of mothers
like Charise Spivey,

33:32.429 --> 33:35.641
tragedy can still befall their children.

33:36.141 --> 33:42.105
And there is no more painful tragedy
than that of indifference.

33:42.981 --> 33:47.569
Four days ago,
teenager Drea Spivey was murdered,

33:48.237 --> 33:50.989
her throat violently throttled

33:50.989 --> 33:52.658
in a shambolic motel room.

33:53.784 --> 33:56.537
We've all been
through Reconsidered enough times

33:56.537 --> 33:58.872
to know how this is supposed to go.

34:00.082 --> 34:04.461
First, I set up the case, the whodunit.

34:05.003 --> 34:10.842
Then I talk about our victim,
humanize them for you.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.178
Lay their corpse bare.

34:14.346 --> 34:17.641
And in this case,
explain why you should care

34:17.641 --> 34:19.393
about a dead prostitute.

34:19.393 --> 34:22.646
Why you should invest time in her story.

34:24.356 --> 34:25.357
But the truth is...

34:27.568 --> 34:32.656
there's no such thing
as a child prostitute.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.033
Who killed Drea Spivey?

34:37.034 --> 34:38.161
I don't know that yet.

34:38.871 --> 34:44.501
But I do know whose fault it is
she was even in that motel room.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.714
Drea's death is our fault.

34:50.174 --> 34:52.176
Drea's death is the fault

34:52.176 --> 34:57.556
of anyone who chose the comfort
of willful ignorance

34:57.556 --> 35:01.768
over the cacophony
of the harsh realities of our world.

35:05.022 --> 35:10.652
There is nothing stronger than the bond
between a mother and her daughter.

35:15.073 --> 35:18.535
And when that bond is rent asunder...

35:21.538 --> 35:22.706
we all suffer.

35:52.903 --> 35:56.865
There are ten Drea Spiveys lost
in Oakland right now,

35:56.865 --> 36:01.537
all at risk of being exploited
into sex trafficking.

36:04.081 --> 36:07.334
That's ten, ten Charise Spiveys

36:07.835 --> 36:10.587
with their hearts beating
outside their chests.

36:13.298 --> 36:17.970
Let's not dare turn a blind eye
to their plight again.

36:50.711 --> 36:52.296
It's a fucking sauna in there.

36:54.506 --> 36:56.800
This rain feels almost as good as you do.

36:57.801 --> 36:58.802
Does it?

36:59.761 --> 37:01.054
We're kind of on display.

37:02.139 --> 37:03.182
We can fix that.

37:03.182 --> 37:04.641
Oh, yeah?
-I live close.

37:05.475 --> 37:08.645
I'm down.
As long as you tell me your real name,

37:08.645 --> 37:10.814
'cause I know that
Bottom2TopEnergy isn't it.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.817
It could be, Alicia.

37:15.277 --> 37:16.278
My name's Eva.

37:17.237 --> 37:20.490
Well, that was a very bold move, Eva,
using your handle on a dating app.

37:22.701 --> 37:25.412
It worked, though, didn't it?
-Obviously.

38:01.281 --> 38:03.367
Eva? How did you find me?
-Can I come in?

38:03.867 --> 38:05.494
I was just about to leave.

38:05.494 --> 38:06.745
Where? Do you have a lead?

38:07.246 --> 38:08.705
Maybe.
-Can I come with?

38:08.705 --> 38:11.542
Eva, you're not a journalist,
nor an investigator.

38:11.542 --> 38:13.710
And I'm not a babysitter.
-And?

38:15.295 --> 38:17.965
And I've been burned before.

38:21.176 --> 38:23.345
Eva, what are you doing here?

38:24.012 --> 38:26.974
The superintendent shut me down
from asking questions at school or...

38:28.016 --> 38:29.685
even acknowledging anything's wrong.

38:29.685 --> 38:32.437
All the memorials around town,
they're all for Emily.

38:34.398 --> 38:35.858
It's like Drea didn't even exist.

38:37.734 --> 38:38.944
I need to act.

38:40.571 --> 38:41.572
You are.

38:42.948 --> 38:44.992
With those bright, young minds you mold.

38:44.992 --> 38:48.287
Well, what use are their minds
if I can't keep their bodies safe?

38:49.037 --> 38:51.874
I've tried so long to protect my students,
but it wasn't enough.

38:53.458 --> 38:54.960
What a fucking fool I've been.

38:56.461 --> 38:58.005
It doesn't sound foolish.

38:58.755 --> 39:00.132
And yet, Drea's still dead.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.135
Seeing her killer won't change that.

39:03.719 --> 39:08.098
But if I could just look into his eyes,
understand his monstrosity.

39:08.098 --> 39:11.310
I c-- I would know what I failed
to warn my girls against.

39:16.273 --> 39:18.066
You stay to the side and silent.

39:19.318 --> 39:20.819
Don't make me regret this.

39:30.204 --> 39:31.205
Dr. Pascal?

39:33.248 --> 39:34.374
I'm Poppy Scoville.

39:35.125 --> 39:38.003
Markus Killebrew. Eva Pierre.

39:39.296 --> 39:40.422
Am I being served?

39:41.465 --> 39:42.633
Look, I already told Corinne

39:42.633 --> 39:44.676
I'm not changing
my alimony agreement again.

39:44.676 --> 39:47.679
Actually, we're here to talk to you
about Drea Spivey.

39:47.679 --> 39:48.764
Yeah.

39:49.848 --> 39:51.558
You might know her as your hooker.

39:54.853 --> 39:56.146
Get off my property.

39:57.022 --> 39:59.775
I hope Laurel has better manners than you.

40:02.110 --> 40:03.695
And how do you know my daughter's name?

40:03.695 --> 40:05.113
I'm a principal.

40:05.113 --> 40:06.657
I hear all the county dirt.

40:07.449 --> 40:11.036
Stories about troubled students...
-Laurel's not troubled.

40:11.036 --> 40:13.288
Well, certainly not now
that you had her DUI cleared.

40:14.456 --> 40:17.167
That wouldn't look good
on college applications, now would it?

40:17.835 --> 40:21.255
How exactly did you get
her DUI cleared, Doctor?

40:21.839 --> 40:23.549
Money isn't always enough.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.052
Harder to get pills these days, huh?

40:28.428 --> 40:32.140
It would be a shame if the medical board
had any reason to look into this.

40:36.812 --> 40:39.898
Look, I don't know what this is,
but I have never seen that woman before.

40:41.692 --> 40:42.693
Here's the problem.

40:43.527 --> 40:46.363
That license plate out there,
it says otherwise.

40:47.614 --> 40:50.659
Here's a pro tip, Mr. IRX4YOU.

40:51.660 --> 40:54.246
If you like to hire underage prostitutes,

40:54.246 --> 40:58.876
then you might want to invest
in a less flashy vanity plate.

40:58.876 --> 41:03.630
Or at the very least,
choose a different Questeur username.

41:04.715 --> 41:05.716
Lucky's underage?

41:05.716 --> 41:08.719
Her real name is Drea Spivey, and she was.

41:08.719 --> 41:11.471
Drea is now dead. She's murdered.

41:11.471 --> 41:14.266
And you were the last person
to be seen with her.

41:15.726 --> 41:18.979
Hey, it wasn't me. I would never hurt her.

41:18.979 --> 41:23.275
Well,
I suggest that you start cooperating.

41:23.901 --> 41:26.570
Think back. Tuesday, that ring a bell?

41:26.570 --> 41:28.280
Where were you around midnight?

41:28.864 --> 41:29.865
Work.

41:30.407 --> 41:33.035
Work. I had an all-nighter.

41:33.035 --> 41:35.454
I had an office emergency.
I got there at 9:00 p.m.

41:35.454 --> 41:38.415
I didn't leave till the sun came up. I--
My admin can confirm everything.

41:39.082 --> 41:42.544
Look, my parking garage has cameras.
I need a key card to get in the elevator.

41:42.544 --> 41:45.547
I'll give you anything you need.
Oh, God. Thank God.

41:46.173 --> 41:47.257
I'm so relieved.

41:47.257 --> 41:50.010
My ex would've bled me dry
if I was a suspect in this.

41:50.010 --> 41:51.428
How was Drea when you left her?

41:52.221 --> 41:54.890
When I left,
I realized that I'd forgotten my tie.

41:54.890 --> 41:56.141
So I went back to the room.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.310
And then when I was there, I heard her--

41:59.561 --> 42:01.688
She was pleading with some guy named Trey.

42:01.688 --> 42:02.981
Pleading?

42:03.482 --> 42:06.401
Yeah. She was saying
that she didn't wanna go on

42:06.401 --> 42:07.653
and that she had paid up.

42:07.653 --> 42:09.112
He said that she still owed him.

42:09.112 --> 42:12.449
And then there was a loud crash
and I heard whimpering.

42:13.242 --> 42:14.243
And what did you do?

42:15.619 --> 42:17.037
And then I turned around and left.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.997
You didn't think to help her?

42:18.997 --> 42:21.041
Hey, I didn't know she was underage.

42:21.041 --> 42:24.336
But you still knew
she was a person though, right?

42:30.092 --> 42:33.011
So, how we working that pimp angle?

42:34.555 --> 42:35.806
We?

42:35.806 --> 42:37.641
Don't you have some kids to look after?

42:38.141 --> 42:40.602
Or are they all just tools for blackmail?
-Markus.

42:41.228 --> 42:43.063
It's okay. I gotta head back to campus.

42:46.233 --> 42:47.317
What the fuck was that?

42:47.317 --> 42:49.194
You told me you were gonna keep her
at arm's length.

42:49.194 --> 42:52.489
She showed up at my house
with this rehearsed plea.

42:52.489 --> 42:54.366
And that bullshit worked?
-No.

42:54.366 --> 42:58.328
Then what are you talking about?
-Then she had this reaction.

42:59.329 --> 43:01.415
I've seen flickers of it before.

43:01.415 --> 43:02.958
She's still hiding something.

43:03.750 --> 43:07.421
And I need to keep her close
until I figure out what it is.

43:07.421 --> 43:08.797
And in the meantime?

43:08.797 --> 43:11.258
That is not the principal I know, okay?

43:11.258 --> 43:12.634
She's a loose cannon.

43:13.135 --> 43:14.219
An effective one.

43:14.219 --> 43:15.304
Yeah, this time.

43:16.096 --> 43:19.349
Markus, that man paid for sex
with a child,

43:19.349 --> 43:22.352
a child he left in imminent danger.
-Poppy, I know that. I know that.

43:25.898 --> 43:27.065
Aames, listen.

43:27.608 --> 43:31.695
We found Drea's last john, Bruno Pascal.

43:31.695 --> 43:33.697
Yeah.
-He has an alibi for time of death

43:33.697 --> 43:34.781
but get this.

43:34.781 --> 43:39.036
He overheard a confrontation
with her and a Trey.

43:39.828 --> 43:40.829
Could be her pimp.

43:44.333 --> 43:46.001
Okay. Okay, thanks.

43:46.835 --> 43:47.878
What's up?

43:47.878 --> 43:51.298
There's a James Benjamin III
in the system, goes by Trey.

43:51.298 --> 43:53.425
Bet.
-Aames is pulling his last known address.

43:56.053 --> 43:57.221
That was fast.

44:01.433 --> 44:02.434
What's up?

44:02.434 --> 44:04.269
It's the same guy from the Gardens.

44:06.396 --> 44:08.649
Drea could have been right there
with him. Shit.

44:08.649 --> 44:09.733
Come on, let's go.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.027
Thanks.

44:33.006 --> 44:34.758
Lukather Shreveport Scoville.

44:34.758 --> 44:36.009
Andrew Finney.

44:37.052 --> 44:38.804
I was pleased to receive your call.

44:39.471 --> 44:41.515
We all need to work together
to restore Oakland.

44:43.058 --> 44:44.434
Is that what you think this is?

44:46.186 --> 44:49.106
I wouldn't work with anybody who pulled
a stunt like you did at my event.

44:49.106 --> 44:51.942
The Capstones needed to take action
for our young girls.

44:52.693 --> 44:56.613
The same young girls you'll be tasked
to protect should you be elected.

44:56.613 --> 44:58.949
I know what my tasks are, Shreve.

44:58.949 --> 45:00.576
To restore law and order,

45:01.118 --> 45:03.620
not this vigilante justice that you pulled
at the event.

45:04.746 --> 45:07.833
The Capstones need
to take a step back. Permanently.

45:09.334 --> 45:10.544
Be good soldiers.

45:11.211 --> 45:12.713
Let the higher-ups handle it.

45:23.307 --> 45:25.601
What's on your mind, baby?
-Nothing.

45:26.602 --> 45:27.603
Just--

45:29.062 --> 45:31.148
I hardly remember Elinor as is.

45:31.148 --> 45:34.568
And everything I do learn makes me feel
like I'll never measure up to her.

45:35.444 --> 45:38.155
Never make her proud,
not like Poppy and Des.

45:38.864 --> 45:40.073
I understand.

45:42.075 --> 45:43.619
You know, Elinor was the architect

45:43.619 --> 45:46.747
behind so much
of what your father lives and breathes.

45:47.456 --> 45:51.418
God, I hear her influence every time he
talks about his plans for the Capstones.

45:52.628 --> 45:55.547
Makes me wonder if he ever truly
carved out a place for me.

45:59.551 --> 46:01.678
I never thought
about what that must be like.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.057
I never wanted you to.

46:06.850 --> 46:11.438
I don't begrudge Elinor one moment
of her too-short life. Trust.

46:14.316 --> 46:15.526
I'm just tired.

46:22.574 --> 46:25.953
You know, there's one
really strong memory I have of my mother.

46:27.538 --> 46:29.998
I was little, sick with a horrible cough.

46:30.582 --> 46:33.085
And Shreve was off God knows where.

46:35.754 --> 46:39.550
I was coughing so hard,
my throat was rubbed bloody raw.

46:40.217 --> 46:42.928
We didn't have insurance,
so no one wanted to see me.

46:46.223 --> 46:49.810
But my mother got the idea
to take me outside.

46:52.271 --> 46:53.605
It was freezing cold.

46:55.357 --> 46:56.733
Bay cold hits different.

46:58.861 --> 47:01.405
And I was crying, screaming, coughing.

47:01.989 --> 47:02.990
A mess.

47:05.826 --> 47:07.035
But she wrapped me up.

47:07.953 --> 47:09.496
Told me stories all night...

47:12.833 --> 47:15.294
until finally, my lungs cleared.

47:18.630 --> 47:20.757
By the time Shreve came home
in the morning,

47:20.757 --> 47:23.302
it was as if nothing had ever happened.
But it did.

47:25.679 --> 47:27.014
I never forgot it.

47:29.975 --> 47:31.226
That wasn't Elinor.

47:32.644 --> 47:33.645
That was me.

47:35.772 --> 47:36.773
I know.

47:42.237 --> 47:44.072
You make me proud all the time.

47:45.324 --> 47:46.325
You too.

47:48.410 --> 47:50.162
Give me a hug.
-I don't wanna hug you.

47:50.162 --> 47:51.288
Please.
-All right.

47:51.288 --> 47:52.414
Thank you.

47:54.041 --> 47:55.083
I love you.

47:55.083 --> 47:56.335
I love you more.

48:03.091 --> 48:05.427
All right. Got a telephonic warrant.

48:05.427 --> 48:06.595
You guys hang back.

48:06.595 --> 48:09.932
This Trey character's got a long,
violent rap sheet.

48:09.932 --> 48:12.392
Once threw boiling water
on one of his girls.

48:13.519 --> 48:14.853
Oakland PD, open up!

48:19.274 --> 48:21.693
Hey, here to see Trey.
-Hey, mama.

48:23.278 --> 48:24.571
You on your hoe stroll?

48:27.533 --> 48:29.076
I think you lied to me, Rochelle.

48:29.076 --> 48:31.703
And who said you were worth telling
the truth to?

48:32.829 --> 48:34.957
You work for Trey, just like Drea did.

48:34.957 --> 48:37.417
Ain't nothing about me
like that weak-ass lil girl.

48:37.417 --> 48:38.919
Okay. Is Trey inside?

48:39.419 --> 48:41.588
Whatever you think you want
with Trey, rethink it.

48:43.549 --> 48:44.550
Wait.

48:45.676 --> 48:46.927
That's Drea's necklace.

48:47.803 --> 48:48.804
What did you do to her?

48:48.804 --> 48:51.265
You fucking with the wrong one, bitch!
-Hey! Easy, easy.

48:51.265 --> 48:52.683
Easy. Come on.
-I will fuck you up.

48:52.683 --> 48:54.226
You're coming with me.
-I'm gonna beat your ass.

48:54.226 --> 48:56.645
All right. Easy. Calm down.
-Get off! Get off of me!

48:56.645 --> 48:58.564
I will get her ass!
-I'm gonna put you down.

48:59.731 --> 49:02.484
Don't you think we should wait for Aames?
-I'm just gonna look around.

49:03.026 --> 49:05.028
Yeah, of course you are.
-Oh, my God!

49:31.054 --> 49:34.433
All right, well, Trey's not home.
You better hurry up.

49:34.433 --> 49:35.976
I mean, he'll be here any minute.
-Okay.

49:35.976 --> 49:37.060
Come on.

49:48.906 --> 49:50.866
Yeah. Now, do doggy style.

49:51.867 --> 49:52.868
Okay.

50:02.753 --> 50:05.339
We're about to get busy
up in this camp.

50:08.217 --> 50:09.760
You ready for me to break your back?

50:10.844 --> 50:13.388
These girls look like they're still
in high school.

50:14.556 --> 50:15.974
Get in the car.

50:15.974 --> 50:18.602
Trey is gonna fuck you up.
-Mind your head.

50:20.812 --> 50:23.065
I can't believe I skipped crew for this.

50:23.649 --> 50:24.983
Bad girl.

50:24.983 --> 50:26.610
Trini.
-I like that.

50:27.236 --> 50:30.906
I like that, I like that.
-Very bad girl.

50:33.158 --> 50:35.410
No. No.

50:39.164 --> 50:41.375
Come on now.
He's on his way back.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.960
Are you listening to me?

50:44.878 --> 50:45.879
What's wrong?

50:46.839 --> 50:48.006
Just wait outside.

50:48.882 --> 50:51.593
What?
-Wait outside, Markus. Please.

50:52.803 --> 50:53.804
Poppy.

51:00.727 --> 51:01.812
What the fuck?
