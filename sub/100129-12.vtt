00:08.138 --> 00:10.532
- Here in The Forge,
America's best bladesmiths

00:10.662 --> 00:12.577
have gone head-to-head
in hopes of becoming

00:12.708 --> 00:13.796
a "Forged in Fire" champion.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.493
- Can you believe it?

00:15.624 --> 00:17.017
- Over the years,
we've seen members

00:17.147 --> 00:19.671
of the same family
compete in our arena...

00:19.802 --> 00:22.065
- I'm here to avenge my father,
and I wanna win.

00:22.196 --> 00:25.677
- But never at the same time,
until now.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.723
Tonight,
in a "Forged in Fire" first,

00:27.853 --> 00:29.899
it's father versus daughter,
dad versus son,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.640
and family versus family.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.642
Only one of these competitors

00:33.772 --> 00:35.774
can be
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.167
- I think I've got
the advantage.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.082
All my joints are still nice
and healthy.

00:39.213 --> 00:39.996
- I'm gonna give it
everything I got.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.345
She's gotta earn it.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.217
- It's the ultimate
family feud.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.219
Loyalties will be put aside,

00:45.349 --> 00:48.178
and only one of these smiths
will bring home the title

00:48.309 --> 00:49.571
and $10,000.

00:49.701 --> 00:50.659
- Oh!

01:00.408 --> 01:01.626
- My name is Ron Hardman.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.541
I'm from Colorado Springs,
Colorado.

01:04.847 --> 01:07.458
- My name is Jessica Hardman.
I am 20 years old.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.895
I am also from
Colorado Springs, Colorado.

01:10.026 --> 01:13.073
- Jessica is my daughter.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.640
Think I was about 15 years old
when I made my first blade.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.729
- My dad is actually
the one who got me interested

01:17.860 --> 01:20.384
in blacksmithing.
My grandpa was a shop teacher.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.038
I've just been around this
my whole life,

01:22.169 --> 01:24.606
and found that
I actually really liked it.

01:24.736 --> 01:27.130
- You're meticulous,
you're detail-oriented,

01:27.261 --> 01:30.090
and so I think you are gonna do
a spectacular job in this.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.482
- Thanks, Dad.

01:33.223 --> 01:36.096
- My name's Jesse Harrison.
I'm from St. Augustine, Texas.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.968
- My name's Robert Harrison.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.231
When I was about eleven,
I built a cowboy cooker

01:41.362 --> 01:43.494
for our 4H show.

01:43.625 --> 01:44.974
And that kinda kick-started
everything.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.107
- This is my son.

01:47.237 --> 01:50.371
Robert's a great bladesmith
because he is persistent.

01:50.501 --> 01:51.894
- I'm gonna say
that my weakness

01:52.024 --> 01:53.852
is also
that same persistence.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.421
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to The Forge.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.944
You are here to engage

01:59.075 --> 02:01.425
in three potentially
home-wrecking rounds

02:01.556 --> 02:03.340
of competition
specifically designed to test

02:03.471 --> 02:04.863
every aspect of your skills,

02:04.994 --> 02:08.040
all in front of our panel
of expert judges.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.564
These are the guys
that will tell us

02:09.694 --> 02:11.522
which of you is our next
"Forged in Fire" champion

02:11.653 --> 02:14.221
walking outta here
with a check for $10,000.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.223
Let's meet your judges now.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.528
Up first, two-time
"Forged in Fire" champion

02:17.659 --> 02:19.182
Ben Abbott.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.402
Next, historic weapons
re-creation specialist

02:21.532 --> 02:23.012
David Baker.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.709
And last,
edged weapons specialist

02:24.840 --> 02:25.580
Doug Marcaida.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.497
Now, this is a free for all.

02:29.627 --> 02:32.500
There is only one title
of "Forged in Fire" champion.

02:32.630 --> 02:35.067
Jessica, what do you think
of your dad as a competitor?

02:35.198 --> 02:36.721
- He's a great teacher
and a great smith,

02:36.852 --> 02:38.636
so I have
my work cut out for me.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.509
We're usually a team,
and--so it's very interesting

02:41.639 --> 02:43.293
to be separate.

02:43.424 --> 02:46.296
I will be competitive,
but he's also my dad, too,

02:46.427 --> 02:48.820
so I won't trash talk him
that much.

02:48.951 --> 02:51.736
- All right.
Robert, is Dad a good teacher?

02:51.867 --> 02:52.607
Can you whup his ass?

02:52.737 --> 02:54.261
- I think I can.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.001
If I beat my dad--well,
I think there'd be

02:56.132 --> 02:57.438
a little tension, there.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.656
Might have to stay away
from the house

02:58.787 --> 02:59.657
for a couple days.

03:01.659 --> 03:04.793
- Okay.
Bladesmiths,

03:04.923 --> 03:06.534
in your first round
of competition today,

03:06.664 --> 03:08.362
you'll be using these.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.720
On this table, we've got
ball bearings, band saw blades,

03:18.850 --> 03:22.114
bike chain, we've got all
manner of high carbon steel.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.029
And in this first round
of competition,

03:24.160 --> 03:26.336
you'll have to choose at least
three of the steels

03:26.467 --> 03:28.295
here on the table
and combine them

03:28.425 --> 03:31.515
with 1095 powder
into a canoe canister

03:31.646 --> 03:33.474
to make
a canister Damascus billet

03:33.604 --> 03:35.693
from which you will forge
a signature blade

03:35.824 --> 03:37.565
in your signature style.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.915
- A canoe is something that
neither one of us

03:40.045 --> 03:43.484
has done before, so it's gonna
be a challenge, for sure.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.573
- If you make it
to the second round,

03:45.703 --> 03:47.531
you'll have a chance to make
your blades fully functional

03:47.662 --> 03:50.099
by attaching handles to them
so that we can test them

03:50.230 --> 03:52.797
for strength and durability
in a pole chop,

03:52.928 --> 03:56.018
and for edge retention
in an apple slice.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.802
When the time runs out
on the clock

03:57.933 --> 03:59.891
and the judges have evaluated
your work,

04:00.022 --> 04:01.415
one of you will have to
surrender your blade

04:01.545 --> 04:03.286
and leave The Forge.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.897
Good luck,
and you young uns,

04:06.028 --> 04:07.334
make your mamas proud;
whup your dads' asses.

04:08.726 --> 04:09.814
Your time starts now.

04:12.077 --> 04:14.515
We've got the Hardmans versus
the Harrisons over here

04:14.645 --> 04:17.082
competing against each other,

04:17.213 --> 04:20.303
and then against each other
at the same time,

04:20.434 --> 04:22.610
but you're seeing them
communicate together.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.046
How does that work?

04:24.176 --> 04:25.917
- I think each of them
would like to win,

04:26.048 --> 04:28.180
but their larger goal is to
make sure that the family wins.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.791
- You need any
of this material here?

04:29.921 --> 04:31.575
- Um, I will, yes.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.099
- Well, my plan is
to, first, get everything clean

04:34.230 --> 04:36.667
to make sure that it's gonna be
a good forge weld.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.366
So I've got a bike chain,
some nice small ball bearings,

04:39.496 --> 04:41.193
and then some band saw blades.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.457
- Mind if I use some of this?
- Go for it.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.110
- I am using the same metals.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.243
It seems to me
that the smaller pieces,

04:47.374 --> 04:49.158
things that are all roughly
about the same size,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.508
usually work together best.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.423
- I like what I see going on
over here.

04:53.554 --> 04:54.903
They're actually cleaning
the material

04:55.033 --> 04:57.079
that they're gonna be putting
in their canister.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.515
- It's smart work,
'cause you know,

04:58.646 --> 05:00.604
how many times have we seen
where you save

05:00.735 --> 05:02.432
five minutes on prep
but it costs you

05:02.563 --> 05:03.912
another hour and a half
on starting a new can?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.131
- Right.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.785
- Coming in here as a family

05:07.916 --> 05:09.961
and working together
with Robert,

05:10.092 --> 05:13.400
I really cherish this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.358
- Did you get enough?
- Yeah.

05:15.489 --> 05:19.275
- I think we both know that we
need to pick our three metals

05:19.406 --> 05:21.886
based on how clean
we can get 'em.

05:22.017 --> 05:25.325
The fishhooks look good,
the ball bearings look good,

05:25.455 --> 05:26.935
so, really, the only ones
we need to clean

05:27.065 --> 05:29.590
are the cylindrical bearings.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.940
And we didn't even have to
communicate that, you know?

05:32.070 --> 05:36.118
We just both knew,
that's what the plan was.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.468
- And I'm making sure
that we get plenty

05:38.599 --> 05:41.428
of 1095 powder
into the canister

05:41.558 --> 05:43.343
to fill it completely up.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.562
I know that that's one
of the most important things,

05:45.693 --> 05:48.130
is not leaving any voids in
there that could show up later.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.480
- There's no white out going on
out there at all,

05:50.611 --> 05:52.569
which is great.
That means these smiths

05:52.700 --> 05:54.615
are gonna save
themselves, what,

05:54.745 --> 05:57.313
20 to 30 minutes of
banging those cans off?

06:01.448 --> 06:03.580
- Welding!

06:03.711 --> 06:06.714
- Jessica, she's the last one
of our smiths doing prep work.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.717
- The potential biggest issue
for me in this challenge is,

06:09.847 --> 06:12.372
I have never had a canister
fail on me,

06:12.502 --> 06:14.330
so I don't know what to do
if it does.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.723
I have done...

06:15.853 --> 06:19.596
three canisters.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.425
- Ron's taking his billet
over to the drill press.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.079
- Yeah, he might put
a vent hole in his canister.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.950
- If you wanna be exacting,

06:26.081 --> 06:29.214
do it the same way every time
and you'll get the same results

06:29.345 --> 06:30.955
She's going for drilling
a hole as well.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.870
- There you go.
Same thing.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.089
- This is the way
the family does it.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.048
- Yep.
- Looking good.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.224
- My biggest concern is
making sure

06:39.355 --> 06:41.923
that my billet
is heated thoroughly.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.491
It's not hot enough, like,
your welds will fail.

06:44.621 --> 06:45.840
- Don't swing for the fences.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.930
- Yeah.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.453
- Wow, that's--look at that.
That's a glowing billet.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.458
- We take turns
getting our welds set,

06:55.589 --> 06:56.546
then neither one of us has to
sit there and wait

06:56.677 --> 06:58.026
on the other one.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.202
- Robert and Jesse
are on the same page,

07:00.332 --> 07:01.899
you know what I mean?

07:02.030 --> 07:03.988
They're working at pretty much
the exact same pace.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.470
- There's gotta be some kind of
comfort being in a competition

07:07.601 --> 07:09.559
with somebody else that taught
you, like, you know,

07:09.690 --> 07:11.605
a father-son,
father-daughter thing.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.345
They're right there.
There's an emotional support.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.436
- We're gonna help each other
as much as possible,

07:16.566 --> 07:19.395
and at the same time,
do what we came to do.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.528
But this little rascal's
been following me around

07:21.658 --> 07:23.138
ever since he was
big enough to walk,

07:23.268 --> 07:25.357
so he knows everything
Dad knows.

07:25.488 --> 07:26.794
- Hot metal.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.491
- So Ron comes off the press--

07:28.622 --> 07:30.319
- Hot metal coming
back through.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.756
And like clockwork, Jessica's
right there to take his place.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.630
- Okay, Jessica's not really
pressing

07:36.760 --> 07:38.066
as much as she oughta be.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.850
- I don't have enough weight
behind me

07:39.981 --> 07:41.548
to actually
make the bar go down

07:41.678 --> 07:43.550
as much as I want it
to go down.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.726
I have to kind of rock myself,
kind of put my weight forward

07:45.856 --> 07:47.902
and move back,
and have to go forward again.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.860
- I noticed Ron
while she was doing that

07:49.991 --> 07:51.645
- Of course,
you're watching over

07:51.775 --> 07:54.038
your little apprentice, there,
your own child; it's like--

07:54.169 --> 07:56.693
and either you're beaming
with hope, or you're concerned.

07:56.824 --> 07:57.694
- How you doin'
on your schedule?

07:57.825 --> 07:59.609
- So far, so good.
- Yep.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.655
- My first reaction is to run
over there and help her,

08:01.785 --> 08:03.004
but I resist the urge.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.486
I have a really good
forge weld.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.879
I know that I'm gonna do
an integrated bolster,

08:09.010 --> 08:11.142
and so I'm setting that up.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.144
The reason I'm putting in the
bolster in the first place,

08:13.275 --> 08:15.973
is because I've got
such a long blade,

08:16.104 --> 08:18.759
I want more weight to be
right back by the index finger.

08:18.889 --> 08:22.763
- Bladesmiths, 90 minutes
has elapsed!

08:24.895 --> 08:27.289
Jesse's profile is coming
along great.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.204
- I wanna make that I have
holes in my tang

08:29.334 --> 08:31.075
by the end of the round.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.817
And drilling through hard steel
is never a good option.

08:33.948 --> 08:37.168
So I've decided to go ahead
and drift those holes in.

08:37.299 --> 08:41.172
Couple of heats and had all
three of my holes done.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.655
- Drifting your holes
should, in theory,

08:45.786 --> 08:47.396
save you some time.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.833
But for some reason
I just can't get my holes

08:49.964 --> 08:51.313
to drift correctly.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.666
- Jessica's really gonna
have to ramp it up here,

08:56.797 --> 08:59.756
because she still just has
a rectangular billet.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.497
- It's taking me
slightly longer

09:01.628 --> 09:04.979
to forge out my billet
than I had hoped.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.850
I'm behind everybody
on the floor.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.506
Hopefully, if I pace myself
right, I should be okay.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.381
- I'm under a lot of pressure.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.950
I'm behind my dad,
but I can't quit on it.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.473
- So Robert's using
close to 20 minutes

09:21.604 --> 09:23.954
just trying to drift
a hole in there.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.913
- Well, I'm a little worried
about running out of time.

09:26.043 --> 09:29.046
But stubbornness kicks in,
I have to make sure

09:29.177 --> 09:31.919
those holes get drifted.

09:32.049 --> 09:35.096
- If you allow your punch
to warm up like Robert just did

09:35.226 --> 09:37.228
then next time you punch down,
you start to feel that anvil.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.274
You're actually swelling
your punch out.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.711
It gets stuck more and more
easily every time that happens.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.408
- Come on.

09:43.539 --> 09:44.322
- He's getting his ass kicked.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.807
- For some reason, I can't get
my holes to drift correctly.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.723
- Flip it over.
Punch it from the back.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.899
- Robert's been wasting time
on that.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.771
- There you go.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.861
- Bladesmiths, 30 minutes
remaining in the round!

10:05.213 --> 10:07.607
- I've got a small warp,
it's nothing I can't take off

10:07.737 --> 10:09.173
with the grinder

10:09.304 --> 10:10.610
- Jesse, really doing
a bang-up job.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.745
- I'm behind schedule.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.139
And so I start to second guess,
a little bit,

10:18.269 --> 10:20.054
the decision on putting
a bolster in there.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.621
There are risks
with doing this.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.797
This was not something
that the judges asked for.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.842
I don't know if
they're going to appreciate it.

10:25.973 --> 10:29.237
- I like what Ron's doing,
putting in an integral bolster.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.325
- Super sexy pants.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.674
- Do it.
How you doing?

10:31.805 --> 10:33.981
- Hangin' in there.
- Time good?

10:34.111 --> 10:35.417
- I think so.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.114
- It's different
in this environment

10:37.245 --> 10:38.986
with my daughter here
because I'm not just thinking

10:39.116 --> 10:40.378
about my own thing
in my head

10:40.509 --> 10:41.771
I'm also thinking about hers.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.904
I'm not interfering,
not doing anything,

10:44.034 --> 10:45.166
but it's still
in the back of my head,

10:45.296 --> 10:46.210
"I wonder how she's doing."

10:48.648 --> 10:49.997
- Look at Jessica
swing this hammer

10:50.127 --> 10:51.563
like she wants the money.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.130
- Finally,
Jessica's making a blade.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.700
- So my plan now is to be done
forging in about five minutes,

10:57.831 --> 10:59.746
and then have my holes
drilled through my tang,

10:59.876 --> 11:03.053
and then get it to brine,
to quench, and get it etched.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.228
And there's a lot
of little steps,

11:04.359 --> 11:05.665
which means
a lot could go wrong.

11:05.795 --> 11:06.970
But a lot could also go right.

11:08.885 --> 11:09.843
- Looks awesome, Jessie.
- Thanks.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.324
- 20 minutes!

11:13.455 --> 11:14.761
- Oh, this is definitely coming
right down to the wire.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.459
- Yeah, Dad.
Whoo.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.678
- Yes!
- Good.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.070
- Nice.
- There we go.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.724
- At this point,
both fathers have quenched,

11:21.855 --> 11:23.944
and neither child has quenched.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.862
- Robert,
where he drifted those holes,

11:28.992 --> 11:32.126
they are not in-line
with anything on his blade.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.432
- And it's not only that,
it's the dimensions

11:34.563 --> 11:36.086
he's gone for that flair,
you know?

11:36.217 --> 11:37.435
- Man, it's--
- Big handle.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.484
- Whoa!

11:42.614 --> 11:44.834
You didn't need
that ponytail, did you kid?

11:46.183 --> 11:48.403
Jessica's blade seems to be
very, very thick,

11:48.533 --> 11:51.841
and she has yet to grind down
to a high carbon steel edge.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.279
- Yeah, and then get it clean
enough you can ash it.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.672
- Yep.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.935
- What I love is
the family dynamics here.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.545
Because you're not
doing it alone,

12:00.676 --> 12:02.286
there's a spiritual support
that you're going through.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.985
- I know my blade is too thick.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.639
So I try to hog some steel off
real quick.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.252
- Robert just quenched.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.689
- During the quench,
I'm definitely nervous.

12:13.820 --> 12:17.127
My blade could warp.
It could crack.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.868
If it cracked, it would be
all over.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.870
It's got a slight warp,

12:21.001 --> 12:22.872
but it's something
that I could work out

12:23.003 --> 12:24.439
at the grinder.

12:24.569 --> 12:27.094
I'm just trying to get
something turned in.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.576
- Ten, nine,

12:31.707 --> 12:33.491
eight, seven,

12:33.622 --> 12:35.537
six, five,

12:35.667 --> 12:37.844
four, three,

12:37.974 --> 12:40.107
two, one!

12:40.237 --> 12:42.544
Bladesmiths, pull your blades
out of the acid!

12:42.674 --> 12:45.373
This first round of competition
is over.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.551
- Time's finally up,
and I don't know

12:49.681 --> 12:50.944
whether to pass out
or lay down.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.297
- Good job, kiddo.
- Good job.

12:56.427 --> 12:57.689
- At the end of the round,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.648
I'm definitely
a little nervous.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.607
The most apparent thing is
that my handle's not complete.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.436
- Bladesmiths,
it's time for the judges

13:05.567 --> 13:07.134
to take a closer look
at what you've done.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.570
Ron, you're up first.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.224
Please present your blade
to the judges.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.662
- Well, Ron, the first thing
that strikes me

13:13.793 --> 13:15.882
on picking this up
is the sheer mass of it.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.623
I mean, this is a heavy,
heavy blade.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.278
That being said, this integral
bolster you put in here,

13:21.409 --> 13:23.324
I give you mad props
for doing it

13:23.454 --> 13:25.021
in this short amount of time.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.806
But if you move forward
from here,

13:26.936 --> 13:27.937
there's gonna have to be
a lot of grinding.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.373
- Yes, sir.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.766
- All right, Jessica,
you're up.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.333
Please present your blade
to the judges.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.423
- All right, Jessica.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.164
It's a straightforward
camp knife.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.949
There's nice scaling to it,
but then when you look

13:40.080 --> 13:42.169
at the edge over here,
there are no bevels here.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.998
It doesn't taper to its edge.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.827
So if you're gonna move
forward, there's a lot of metal

13:47.957 --> 13:49.611
here that needs to be removed.

13:49.741 --> 13:50.830
- Thank you.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.527
- All right, Jesse, you're up.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.183
- So nicely done, Jesse.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.185
It's a clean profile

13:58.315 --> 13:59.882
that doesn't really
need to change that much.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.798
But there's certainly a lot
of mass in this blade

14:02.929 --> 14:04.887
that has to just go away.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.106
You know, if you move forward,

14:06.236 --> 14:07.585
it's gonna be a lot
of grinding

14:07.716 --> 14:09.283
and not a lot of time
to do it in.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.067
- Thank you.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.286
- All right, Robert,
you're up next.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.462
Please present your blade
to the judges.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.334
- All right, Robert.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.684
This is the heaviest
of the lot.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.904
You know, I commend people
who never quit,

14:22.035 --> 14:24.907
but in a timed competition,
it was 20 minutes spent

14:25.038 --> 14:26.474
to try to drift these holes in.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.042
That could be 20 minutes spent
grinding away.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.957
I like your blade shape,

14:31.087 --> 14:32.872
it's just that the scale
of this handle,

14:33.002 --> 14:36.353
putting your hand around it,
makes it very uncomfortable.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.834
If you move forward, this is
your big problem child

14:38.965 --> 14:41.097
right here.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.446
- All right, bladesmiths,

14:42.577 --> 14:44.448
the judges' deliberation
is complete.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.668
They've made
their final decision.

14:46.798 --> 14:47.930
The bladesmith leaving
The Forge is...

14:54.763 --> 14:55.764
Robert.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.809
Your blade didn't make the cut.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.986
Doug Marcaida's gonna
tell you why.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.466
- Robert, where the amount of
metal and weight were an issue,

15:02.597 --> 15:04.338
your blade was the heaviest.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.557
That, and the size and scale
of your handle:

15:06.688 --> 15:08.255
It's for these reasons,
we're sending you home.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.344
- Robert, you did a great job.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.085
But at this time I have to
ask you to, please,

15:12.215 --> 15:12.999
surrender your blade.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.959
- Of course I'm disappointed.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.744
Time management is
a huge factor

15:19.875 --> 15:23.487
and I just let stubbornness
get the best of me, I guess.

15:23.618 --> 15:24.967
I'm not coming home
as a winner,

15:25.098 --> 15:26.926
but, Dad, give 'em hell,

15:27.056 --> 15:28.057
To represent the family.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.539
- Good job, man, good job.

15:31.669 --> 15:32.670
- Thank you.
- Love you.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.846
- I love you.
You got this.

15:34.977 --> 15:35.673
I think you can bring
this home.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.114
- Bladesmiths, congratulations,

15:41.244 --> 15:43.551
you've made it to the second
round of this competition,

15:43.681 --> 15:46.119
which for you, Jesse,
I'm sure is bittersweet.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.816
This is a competition

15:47.947 --> 15:49.731
where we take sons
and daughters and fathers,

15:49.861 --> 15:50.819
and pit them
against each other.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.082
So we thought it
only appropriate

15:53.213 --> 15:54.692
to add this
to the competition.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.180
A grandfather clock.

16:04.311 --> 16:05.965
In this second round
of competition,

16:06.095 --> 16:08.010
you'll source the material
that you need

16:08.141 --> 16:11.796
to finish your blades,
from this grandfather clock.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.234
You'll have just two hours to
finish your blades,

16:14.364 --> 16:16.584
make the handle,
attach it to your blades,

16:16.714 --> 16:19.152
and have them acid etched
so that we can test them

16:19.282 --> 16:22.111
for strength and durability
in a pole chop

16:22.242 --> 16:25.854
and for edge retention
in an apple slice.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.075
Good luck, bladesmiths,
your two hours starts now.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.947
- That's what
you're looking for.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.862
- What about this bottom piece
right there?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.212
Let me get--I'm gonna go grab
a whole band.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.518
- All right, let me get
a crowbar.

16:37.648 --> 16:38.867
- I can go get another one,
too.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.348
- These guys have to basically
harvest wood

16:41.478 --> 16:43.132
off of this
grandfather clock.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.786
- I'm thinking that
all the panels and all

16:44.916 --> 16:45.830
will be hardwood.

16:45.961 --> 16:46.875
And they're not.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.225
No good.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.358
- Some of it's just
straight up cardboard.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.012
- Right there.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.970
- Look at Jesse,
he's pointing at it saying,

16:55.101 --> 16:55.840
"look, check this thing out."
- Yeah.

16:55.971 --> 16:56.885
- That's good, man.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.409
- One, two, three.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.716
- It's cool to see people
working together like this.

17:01.846 --> 17:05.067
- I'm pretty sure these two
pieces are the only good ones.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.026
- All right, let's get
to the saw.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.810
I wanna take care of the handle
first to get that epoxied

17:08.940 --> 17:10.246
and in place.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.421
Seems like it's hickory.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.206
Hickory is great stuff.

17:13.336 --> 17:14.468
We use it actually when
we're making hammer handles.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.861
Nice.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.299
- Ron and Jessica, you know,
they have the benefit

17:19.429 --> 17:22.302
of putting four hands
on any project, which can make,

17:22.432 --> 17:24.652
you know, the workload
a little bit lighter.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.567
- So the handle's
my top priority,

17:26.697 --> 17:28.525
and then grinding,
so it's a lot to do.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.266
So I really need to plan,

17:30.397 --> 17:32.703
and, hopefully,
stick to that plan.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.663
- All these guys need
are scales, flat wooden scales.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.752
Keep it simple
'cause get to the grinder,

17:37.882 --> 17:39.406
those are heavy blades
right now.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.798
- For my handle construction,

17:40.929 --> 17:42.974
I'm just gonna stay
with something simple,

17:43.105 --> 17:46.239
something that the judges
can swing with no issue.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.110
I wanna put my blade on a diet

17:48.241 --> 17:50.417
and get some of the weight
off of it.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.332
Robert's not here,
I'm gonna just keep grinding.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.724
I've gotta represent
both of us now.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.946
- I wanna get the handle
on there right now

17:58.077 --> 18:00.383
so that the epoxy
has time to set

18:00.514 --> 18:02.690
while I, then, turn
my attention back over

18:02.820 --> 18:05.214
to the blade to turn this beast
into a knife.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.782
I'm just watching every minute
and trying to go methodically

18:07.912 --> 18:09.131
through this process.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.480
It's a little stressful.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.483
- I wanna spend
this first hour

18:13.614 --> 18:15.311
getting the weight down
on that blade.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.313
And then second hour,
I'm gonna tackle the handle.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.663
- Jesse, he's got
grinding skills.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.187
He just has to do
a lot of it.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.321
- I'm hoping that
this drop-point Bowie

18:25.452 --> 18:28.368
that I'm making will kind of
be the answer for both tests.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.979
Historically, it's been used
to do everything

18:31.110 --> 18:33.547
from chop brush out of the way
to cut up your dinner.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.985
- My tang is
really thick right now.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.813
And I decided to keep it
that way

18:38.943 --> 18:41.468
because I think that my knife
will need a lot of balance,

18:41.598 --> 18:42.991
because it's so long.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.124
- Setting a handle
on that tang, at this point,

18:45.254 --> 18:46.951
absolutely pointless.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.476
That tang is still 3/8
of an inch thick.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.957
It needs to be ground down.
It needs to be reshaped.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.525
- Then I realized, because
I haven't ground my tang,

18:55.656 --> 18:59.399
there are several gaps between
the pieces of my handle.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.750
And the less contact I have,
the less sturdy

19:02.880 --> 19:04.491
it's going to be,
which means later, in testing,

19:04.621 --> 19:05.318
it might break.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.454
- Bladesmiths, you have
less than an hour remaining

19:11.585 --> 19:13.195
to finish your work!

19:13.326 --> 19:15.806
- So I gotta think of a way
to improvise.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.722
And I decide to put
more epoxy down in it,

19:18.853 --> 19:20.420
and, hopefully, when grinding,
it will kind of fill

19:20.550 --> 19:23.074
with some sawdust, and
kind of be unnoticeable.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.946
- How's it going?
Doin' all right?

19:25.076 --> 19:26.643
- I think so.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.168
- Jesse's trying to work
on his handle now.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.213
- My handle construction's
just gonna be

19:31.344 --> 19:35.609
my two handle slabs, epoxy,
and a stainless steel pin.

19:35.739 --> 19:39.134
Give it a good mechanical
and chemical connection.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.310
- Starting with the blade,
going to the handle,

19:41.441 --> 19:43.443
coming bacto the blade.
It's a great tactic.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.360
- You can definitely tell
we're related.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.927
Just the way we're doing stuff.
Kind of funny.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.191
I still need to
finish grinding,

19:52.321 --> 19:54.628
get the edge on there,
and finish the handle.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.978
And finally etch,
so I have a lot to do.

19:57.108 --> 20:00.895
- Bladesmiths, you've only got
20 minutes left,

20:01.025 --> 20:04.028
and then we're testing the hell
out of these things!

20:04.159 --> 20:04.899
- I know I'm not
gonna be able to spend

20:05.029 --> 20:06.683
anywhere near the time

20:06.814 --> 20:08.511
that I would normally spend
on the handle with this,

20:08.642 --> 20:10.644
but you gotta do
what you gotta do.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.081
- I could take my blade down
slightly thinner,

20:13.212 --> 20:15.953
but I'm looking at the clock,
and I decide it still needs

20:16.084 --> 20:17.607
more sharpening work
done on it.

20:20.567 --> 20:23.613
- Time's ticking down,
and I've got to etch my blade.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.617
- We have 45 seconds left.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.445
Both Jessica and I are
at the grinders,

20:29.576 --> 20:31.055
and no communication
was necessary.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.883
We need to etch.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.495
- Both of the Hardmans going
to the acid right now.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.671
Oh, my God, don't struggle
with that lid.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.020
Don't struggle with the lid.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.064
There we go.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.375
Hurry up!

20:46.506 --> 20:48.377
Five, four,

20:48.508 --> 20:50.379
three, two,

20:50.510 --> 20:51.989
one!

20:52.120 --> 20:53.469
Bladesmiths,
stop what you're doing.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.863
Pull your blade
out of that acid.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.736
- This second round
of competition is over.

20:59.867 --> 21:00.694
- Oh, my God.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.740
- Good job.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.742
- Did you see Ron squirt
Jessica's blade as he ran by.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.135
- I saw it.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.398
- I don't get to
neutralize mine,

21:09.529 --> 21:11.400
but I never would have made it
back to my blade.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.663
I'm 46 years old, and I don't
run that fast anymore.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.102
- Bladesmiths, welcome
to the strength test.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.974
To test the strength
and durability of your edge

21:20.104 --> 21:21.932
as well as the overall
construction of your blades,

21:22.063 --> 21:24.500
I'll be bashing them
mercilessly into these poles.

21:25.675 --> 21:26.850
Ron, you're up first.
You ready for this?

21:26.981 --> 21:28.591
- Absolutely, have at it.
- All right.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.855
- I know that I didn't have
enough time

21:31.986 --> 21:34.249
to put on a good edge.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.512
You could end up with a broken
blade on something like this.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.209
It could roll an edge.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.863
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

21:58.273 --> 22:01.232
- Well, Ron, you've got
a pretty obtuse edge,

22:01.363 --> 22:03.017
which is good
at avoiding damage,

22:03.147 --> 22:05.193
not the best for fine cutting.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.457
There's one tiny place here
that has glinting on it,

22:08.588 --> 22:11.242
but other than that,
the edge is in good shape.

22:11.373 --> 22:15.159
One thing I don't like
about this knife is right here.

22:15.290 --> 22:18.075
It is round and small,
and there was a couple times

22:18.206 --> 22:19.120
when I was hitting where
the blade would just

22:19.250 --> 22:21.122
twist in my hand.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.777
But it's comfortable,
it's just difficult to control

22:23.907 --> 22:24.778
because of the size of it.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.475
- Yes, sir.

22:27.650 --> 22:28.956
- All right, Jessica,
you see what we're up to.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.305
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.524
- All right, let's do it.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.745
- I am starting to sweat
a little bit.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.095
I mean, did my heat treat
go okay?

22:38.226 --> 22:39.619
If it breaks,
will it break big

22:39.749 --> 22:41.882
or will it just
make a dent in the side?

22:42.012 --> 22:44.493
I am both excited
and very nervous.

23:00.944 --> 23:04.252
- Good job.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.950
- Well, Jessica,
there's a glint

23:07.081 --> 23:08.387
that happened right there.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.345
The rest of your edge held up
really well,

23:10.476 --> 23:13.609
but there are sharp corners
here on the handle

23:13.740 --> 23:16.046
that were biting into my pinky,

23:16.177 --> 23:17.526
but much less weight
than it had before,

23:17.657 --> 23:18.527
so well done.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.050
- Thank you.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.444
- Jesse, you're up.
How're you thinking?

23:22.575 --> 23:24.707
- Little nervous, but have fun.

23:24.838 --> 23:25.578
- All right, I will.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.670
- I'm concerned,

23:30.800 --> 23:33.324
I didn't have quite as much
time as I'd like to.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.196
The other two blades have
survived

23:35.326 --> 23:37.764
with hardly any damage
whatsoever.

23:37.894 --> 23:41.332
So the pressure's really on
for my blade to perform.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.700
- Well, Jesse, I like
the profile you've got here.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.964
It's got a pretty obtuse edge
for everyday use,

24:04.094 --> 24:05.661
but it makes a good chopper

24:05.792 --> 24:07.620
so it held up well
in this test.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.578
Although it's a relatively
simple looking handle,

24:09.709 --> 24:11.014
it's a comfortable handle.

24:11.145 --> 24:14.061
So, in all,
your edge held up well.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.063
It's a good feeling
and good working knife.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.368
Well done.
- Thank you.

24:23.026 --> 24:25.289
- All right, gang, it's time
for the sharpness test,

24:25.420 --> 24:26.943
the apple slice.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.292
Now, I'm looking for cuts
where the apple is cut

24:28.423 --> 24:30.120
all the way through.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.906
Not cut partially through
and broken the rest of the way.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.081
Ron, you're up first.
You ready?

24:34.211 --> 24:35.735
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.432
- I'm concerned about
Ben saying,

24:37.563 --> 24:39.521
"There isn't a sharp
edge on this."

24:39.652 --> 24:42.393
There might be more applesauce
than apple slices.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.394
You know,
I could be sent home.

24:57.844 --> 25:01.674
- Okay, Ron, so--pretty
obtuse edge.

25:01.804 --> 25:05.504
And you can see that half
that apple is cut smoothly,

25:05.634 --> 25:07.070
and then it cracks.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.072
It's a fat edge,
but will it cut?

25:09.203 --> 25:10.421
Yes, it will cut.

25:10.552 --> 25:11.945
- Gotcha.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.163
- All right, Jessica,
you're up next.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.077
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.644
- Okay.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.885
So, Jessica, you can see on
this blade

25:39.015 --> 25:42.105
that one side is almost flat
and the other side

25:42.236 --> 25:43.933
kinda curves down to it.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.456
So I start going
through the apples

25:45.587 --> 25:47.023
It's just "whoosh,"
like a wing,

25:47.154 --> 25:48.895
rode right up out of them.

25:49.025 --> 25:52.115
The biggest thing is the square
edges on this handle.

25:52.246 --> 25:54.161
I feel all these corners.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.598
But you did a good job getting
a lot of the weight

25:56.729 --> 25:58.774
out of the blade of this knife,
and it will cut.

25:58.905 --> 25:59.819
You got that going
for you.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.909
- All right, Jesse,
you're up.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.171
You ready?
- I think so.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.302
- Okay.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.503
So, Jesse,
what I'm looking at here

26:32.634 --> 26:35.028
is actually some pretty
clean cuts on these apples.

26:35.158 --> 26:36.725
- Thank you.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.380
- That's a good shape,
cut apples nicely.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.078
Good job.
- Thank you.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.645
- All right, bladesmiths.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.560
The judges' deliberation
is complete.

26:45.691 --> 26:46.953
They have made
their final decision.

26:47.083 --> 26:50.043
It's time for one of you smiths
to leave The Forge.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.958
The bladesmith leaving
The Forge is...

26:57.006 --> 26:59.356
- Jessica, your blade did not
make the cut,

26:59.487 --> 27:01.837
Doug Marcaida's
gonna tell you why.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.883
- Jessica,
your edge wasn't as sharp

27:04.013 --> 27:05.536
as that of your competitors.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.626
And your handle had some
hot spots

27:07.756 --> 27:09.149
that made it uncomfortable
for Ben to swing

27:09.279 --> 27:10.411
during the strength test.

27:10.541 --> 27:11.804
For that reason,
we're sending you home.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.153
- Right.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.981
- Jessica, you did
a fantastic job.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.939
But at this time, I have to
please ask you

27:17.070 --> 27:19.028
to surrender your blade
and leave The Forge.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.162
- Obviously I'm disappointed,
but at the same time,

27:22.292 --> 27:25.208
I'm thrilled for my dad.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.558
I get to go back home and be
my dad's biggest cheerleader.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.039
Take it for the Hardmans.
- Aw.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.128
This competition came down
to the details.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.478
When I get home, I'm gonna give
my family a big hug,

27:34.609 --> 27:36.045
and go hang out
with my dogs.

27:41.442 --> 27:44.445
- Ron, Jesse, I'm renaming
this competition

27:44.575 --> 27:46.882
"Papa Don't Take No Mess,"

27:47.013 --> 27:50.016
because it's just
the patriarchs of the families

27:50.146 --> 27:52.148
goin' at it in our final round
of this competition,

27:52.279 --> 27:53.933
where we're sending you back
to your home forges

27:54.063 --> 27:56.805
to re-create this iconic weapon
from history.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.421
The Inigo Montoya
inspired rapier.

28:04.552 --> 28:05.771
You know the guy.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.642
"You killed my father,
prepare to--"

28:07.773 --> 28:09.557
Forge, all right?

28:10.906 --> 28:12.691
- Considered one of the
greatest swordsmen

28:12.821 --> 28:14.301
of his generation,

28:14.431 --> 28:16.216
Inigo Montoya
is a fictional character

28:16.346 --> 28:17.652
from the cult classic
"The Princess Bride."

28:17.783 --> 28:19.523
According to the story,

28:19.654 --> 28:21.438
this famous blade was
the finest sword ever crafted

28:21.569 --> 28:24.528
by his father and parallels
Spanish swept hilt rapiers

28:24.659 --> 28:26.313
of the 17th century,

28:26.443 --> 28:27.662
featuring a diamond
cross section

28:27.793 --> 28:30.056
and a complex,
elaborate guard.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.362
Intended for dueling,
rapiers are lightweight

28:32.493 --> 28:34.756
and feature a narrow point
allowing for quick cuts

28:34.887 --> 28:37.150
and deadly,
accurate thrusts.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.674
One of the most recognized
swordfights in pop culture,

28:39.805 --> 28:41.632
Montoya infamously uses
the weapon

28:41.763 --> 28:42.982
against his father's killer,

28:43.112 --> 28:46.072
fulfilling his quest
for revenge.

28:46.202 --> 28:49.989
- Inigo Montoya's rapier is
a classic sword in movie lore,

28:50.119 --> 28:52.513
and my family and I have seen
the movie a hundred times

28:52.643 --> 28:54.428
- In this final round
of the competition,

28:54.558 --> 28:56.473
you will have to forge
an effective

28:56.604 --> 28:58.780
and working version of
the weapon that you see here.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.087
Make sure it falls within
the following parameters.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.742
The length of the blade,
from the tip to the ricasso,

29:03.872 --> 29:06.745
must be between 37
and 39 inches.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.443
Your handle must have two top
rings, two side rings,

29:09.573 --> 29:13.969
two upswept quillion, two arms,
a knuckle-bow, and a pommel.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.102
You'll have just four days
at your home forges

29:16.232 --> 29:18.234
in which to complete
all this work.

29:18.365 --> 29:19.801
And, of course, at the end of
those four days,

29:19.932 --> 29:21.542
you'll return
and present your weapons

29:21.672 --> 29:23.849
to our panel
of expert judges.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.981
And after they've thoroughly
tested them,

29:26.112 --> 29:28.462
they'll declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

29:28.592 --> 29:32.771
who gets to take his family
a check for $10,000.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.773
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in four days.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.346
- It's day one,
I'm about to start building

29:43.477 --> 29:45.827
Inigo Montoya inspired rapier.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.222
There's not a whole lot
of room for error.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.965
So slow and steady will be
the name of the game.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.489
But I would really like to be
through with the blade today.

29:55.619 --> 29:58.100
The guard is very intricate,
and it's gonna take

29:58.231 --> 29:59.885
a lot of attention
to detail.

30:00.015 --> 30:03.149
And the sooner I can get
on it, the better off I'll be.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.411
Here, in a minute,
we're gonna start getting ready

30:04.541 --> 30:05.368
for the heat treat.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.373
- I'm really worried
that a blade this long

30:10.504 --> 30:11.548
is gonna come out warped.

30:13.637 --> 30:16.336
- This is
the make or break moment.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.077
So we're kinda at
a mystery place.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.774
We don't know whether it's hard

30:19.905 --> 30:20.688
and we don't know
whether it's straight.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.777
Time's over for today.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.040
I guess we'll find out
in the morning.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.437
- Jessica, I'm gonna tell you
a story about making

30:30.567 --> 30:33.266
an Inigo Montoya
inspired sword.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.616
As the story goes,
Inigo Montoya's sword

30:35.746 --> 30:37.444
took a full year
to make.

30:37.574 --> 30:38.793
I have four days.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.795
I am almost positive that

30:40.926 --> 30:42.928
they're gonna do
some kind of a flex test.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.844
So I'm choosing 80CRV2, and
that should help with that.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.150
The hilt is one of
the more complex pieces here.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.979
I'm actually gonna use
some really old wrought iron.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.894
One of the really nice things
about wrought iron

30:53.025 --> 30:56.071
is that it's beautiful,
and my plan is to acid etch

30:56.202 --> 30:57.290
so you can see the lines
around this thing.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.989
I'm working on
my normalization.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.643
This is make or break.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.776
If it works well,
I'm all set.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.388
I grab hold of it with another
pair of tongs and go for it.

31:09.650 --> 31:12.261
I am very pleased right now to
have, at the end of day one,

31:12.392 --> 31:15.047
a quenched blade,
ready for temper

31:15.177 --> 31:16.004
So far, I'm on track.

31:18.006 --> 31:20.400
- That doesn't sound too bad.
I'll try to stay awake.

31:22.054 --> 31:22.924
- After coming out
of the temper,

31:23.055 --> 31:24.317
I noticed
that there was

31:24.447 --> 31:26.928
just a slight
little yaw in the edge.

31:27.059 --> 31:30.105
Try and take all that out
in grinding today.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.542
Next, I'ma move on
to the hilt.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.936
I'm planning on forging
all the parts for the hilt

31:35.067 --> 31:37.808
out of an old wagon wheel that
my grandfather used to own.

31:43.205 --> 31:46.165
So I'm flipping it over, and
I ended up getting a crack.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.299
Got a small crack that's
developed in the piece

31:50.430 --> 31:52.649
that I was forging
for my pommel.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.086
I'm gonna try to see if I can
get that crack out of it.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.569
Crack seems to be
just getting worse.

32:02.094 --> 32:05.097
I've been chasing this crack
for about an hour.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.750
I'm wanting to make the whole
thing out of wrought,

32:06.881 --> 32:08.056
but if this doesn't work out,

32:08.187 --> 32:10.406
I'm gonna have to find
another option.

32:10.537 --> 32:13.409
Luckily, it took one more good,
hot weld and heat,

32:13.540 --> 32:14.236
and we're good to go.

32:16.412 --> 32:19.285
I think I feel better today
than I did on day one.

32:19.415 --> 32:22.462
End of day two, I'm ready
to go put my feet up.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.554
- Well, my goal is to actually
get done with the blade today.

32:27.684 --> 32:30.470
It leaves me two days to work
on all of the embellishments.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.951
I may get into doing some
of the hilt work today,

32:33.081 --> 32:34.953
I wanna see how it goes
with the grinding.

32:35.083 --> 32:39.131
If I over grind, I could
completely destroy the blade.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.263
There's a reason that it took
Inigo Montoya's father

32:41.394 --> 32:42.961
a year to make this sword.

32:43.091 --> 32:45.006
There are so many pieces
to this.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.835
But for Jessica, I'm gonna
get this done in four days.

32:50.098 --> 32:52.274
- Got a little bit behind
where I would like to be.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.450
I'm gonna try to make up
a little time,

32:54.581 --> 32:56.800
I'm gonna go ahead and forge
out a knuckle-bow,

32:56.931 --> 32:58.759
and hopefully by lunchtime,

32:58.889 --> 33:00.282
I'ma startfabricating the hilt.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.460
This hilt's been
pretty demanding.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.245
There's about six different
pieces here.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.943
We spent a lot of time
trying to make sure

33:09.074 --> 33:11.990
everything was dialed in.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.994
End of day three, my hilt all
came together pretty nicely.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.779
Just pulled it out of the
etch, everything looks good.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.521
Tomorrow will just be
fit and finish.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.871
My boys popped in to see it.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.395
- Daddy, he's the one that
taught us everything we know.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.050
- That--you'll never hear
that again.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.921
That's the only time
they'll ever admit that.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.230
I would have much rather be
forging

33:35.361 --> 33:38.320
with and against my son,
but now I need to try

33:38.451 --> 33:40.714
to bring this home for me
and for him, too.

33:42.759 --> 33:45.545
- Last day, I have to get
done, well, everything.

33:45.675 --> 33:48.417
Now I can focus on getting
that really complex

33:48.548 --> 33:50.419
handle and hilt all together.

33:50.550 --> 33:51.986
I'm forging out
these bigger rings

33:52.117 --> 33:54.293
that are on
the side of the handle.

33:54.423 --> 33:58.036
That's eventually gonna become
this really complex basket.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.168
Not perfect, but for day four,
I'll take it.

34:00.299 --> 34:02.083
Regardless of the outcome
on this thing,

34:02.214 --> 34:04.216
I've had a blast making this.
Win, lose, or draw,

34:04.346 --> 34:05.869
it's just been so much fun.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.524
- Good job.
- Thank you.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.966
- Ron, Jesse, welcome back
to The Forge.

34:16.097 --> 34:18.273
- Ron, tell us about
your blade.

34:18.404 --> 34:22.408
- It's 80CRV2 for the blade,
wrought iron for the guard,

34:22.538 --> 34:24.062
and for the pommel.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.455
And then it's
a resin-ivory handle.

34:26.586 --> 34:29.023
- Okay.
Jesse, how'd it go for you?

34:29.154 --> 34:30.633
- Went pretty well.

34:30.764 --> 34:33.680
I've used 80CRV2 as well
for my steel,

34:33.810 --> 34:37.640
and the wrought iron for
the hilt and the pommel,

34:37.771 --> 34:41.253
and the handle is
a green lemon Micarta.

34:41.383 --> 34:42.645
- All right, gentlemen.

34:42.776 --> 34:43.994
The judges will now
put your blades

34:44.125 --> 34:45.518
through a series
of three tests.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.868
There will be a strength test,
a sharpness test.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.175
And up first, Doug?

34:52.786 --> 34:55.397
- All right, daddy bladesmiths,

34:55.528 --> 34:58.661
my name is Douglas Marcaida,
I will kill the dummies.

34:58.792 --> 34:59.532
They are prepared to die.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.405
To find out what kind of lethal
damage your weapons will do,

35:03.536 --> 35:05.015
I will take your rapiers and
deliver some thrusts

35:05.146 --> 35:06.756
and slashes
on this ballistics dummy.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.236
Ron, you're up first.
You ready for this?

35:08.367 --> 35:09.281
- Absolutely.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.457
- Let's do it.

35:11.587 --> 35:12.675
- When Doug picks up the sword,

35:12.806 --> 35:14.112
I know exactly
what he's thinking

35:14.242 --> 35:16.288
and that it's a little bit
on the tip heavy side.

35:16.418 --> 35:17.506
And I'm pretty nervous.

35:57.938 --> 36:00.593
- All right, Ron, let's talk
about your rapier here.

36:00.723 --> 36:01.942
It is a little bit on the
heavier side,

36:02.072 --> 36:03.639
but it's wieldable,

36:03.770 --> 36:08.253
and with a nice swish of a
slash, it cuts deeply.

36:08.383 --> 36:10.820
Overall, sir, your rapier,
it will KEAL.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.213
Good job.
- Thank you.

36:12.344 --> 36:13.345
- All right, Jesse,
it's your turn.

36:13.475 --> 36:15.129
Are you ready, sir?
- Yes, sir.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.391
- Let's do this.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.350
- I'm extremely nervous.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.830
I immediately start
questioning my heat treat

36:20.961 --> 36:22.658
and, you know, just a million
things go through your head.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.255
- All right, Jesse, let's talk
about your blade here.

36:54.386 --> 36:56.170
It's about the same weight,

36:56.301 --> 36:58.216
the thrusts penetrate
all the way,

36:58.346 --> 37:01.306
and to slash, well, deep cuts.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.309
Overall, sir, your blade,
it will KEAL.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.571
- Thank you, sir.
That's what I came to hear.

37:09.009 --> 37:10.010
- All right, gentlemen,

37:10.140 --> 37:11.490
it's time
for the strength test.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.057
And yes, I am going to torture
your blades.

37:14.188 --> 37:15.320
Ron, you're up first.

37:15.450 --> 37:16.277
- All right.

37:28.028 --> 37:31.074
- If you haven't guessed
already, it's a flex test.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.642
- I'm feeling a little nervous
coming in to this test.

37:33.773 --> 37:36.036
If I left any uneven spots,
that could impact

37:36.166 --> 37:37.124
the flexibility
of that blade.

38:05.195 --> 38:07.807
- Good job, man, good job.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.157
- Okay, Ron,
that's a brutal test,

38:10.288 --> 38:12.028
and you did really well.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.726
If you look at your blade,

38:13.856 --> 38:17.120
there's the slightest bend
in one direction,

38:17.251 --> 38:18.731
barely noticeable.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.647
The dimensions of the guard
are spot on

38:21.777 --> 38:23.126
- Thank you.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.650
- And it's definitely
a strong blade.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.347
Nicely done.
- Thank you very much.

38:26.478 --> 38:27.740
- Jesse, you ready for this?

38:27.870 --> 38:29.481
- 'Bout as nervous
as a long-tailed cat

38:29.611 --> 38:30.656
in a room
full of rocking chairs.

38:30.786 --> 38:31.700
But go ahead.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.210
- First thing is, Jesse,

39:03.341 --> 39:05.473
the guard's
in the proper scale.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.127
Really nicely done.

39:07.257 --> 39:10.435
Issue is, you picked up
a bit of a bend.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.872
Still a completely functional,
useable blade.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.743
Well done.
- Thank you.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.835
- Bladesmiths, this is
the sharpness test.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.576
This is all about
how sharp your blade is.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.318
What it does to this dummy.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.580
Ron, you're up first,
you ready for this?

39:25.711 --> 39:27.365
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

39:41.727 --> 39:43.555
All right, Ron, let's talk
about your edge here.

39:43.685 --> 39:47.210
This cut through the clothing
and right into the foam.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.474
Of course, when thrusting
it goes deep.

39:49.604 --> 39:53.303
Overall, sir, it will cut.
- Thank you.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.304
- All right, Jesse,
it's your turn.

39:54.435 --> 39:55.567
So you ready?
- Yes, sir.

39:55.697 --> 39:56.481
- Let's do this.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.107
All right, Jesse, I can still
see the little bend

40:14.237 --> 40:17.545
it took at the tip,
but the edges are razor sharp.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.287
On the thrust it goes deep,
it will cut.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.680
- Thank you, sir.

40:23.377 --> 40:24.900
- Ron, Jesse,
you guys have turned in

40:25.031 --> 40:27.381
some really quality blades.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.209
This is a difficult decision
for us to make.

40:29.339 --> 40:32.212
Our "Forged in Fire" champion
is...

40:35.868 --> 40:36.869
- Ron.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.479
Congratulations,

40:38.610 --> 40:40.133
you are the new
"Forged in Fire" champion.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.004
Jesse, unfortunately,

40:42.135 --> 40:44.485
your blade did not
make the cut.

40:44.616 --> 40:46.966
Ben Abbott's
gonna tell you why.

40:47.096 --> 40:50.752
Well, Jesse, the craftsmanship
on your sword is commendable,

40:50.883 --> 40:53.451
and the balance on it
was really well done.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.061
But at the end of the day,
in the strength test,

40:55.191 --> 40:57.237
your blade took a bend,
and that brings into question

40:57.367 --> 40:58.847
the heat treat on your sword.

40:58.978 --> 41:00.501
It's for this reason,
we're letting you go.

41:00.632 --> 41:03.330
- Jesse,
please surrender your blade.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.375
- Not being
the "Forged in Fire" champion

41:05.506 --> 41:07.073
is, kinda, not what I was
looking for,

41:07.203 --> 41:09.336
but, I lost to
a heck of a competitor

41:09.467 --> 41:10.468
and a heck of a blade.

41:10.598 --> 41:12.034
- Well done.
- Thank you.

41:12.165 --> 41:13.558
I'm very proud of the blade
I turned in,

41:13.688 --> 41:15.603
but if I made
this blade again,

41:15.734 --> 41:17.213
I woulda took a little more
time on my heat treat,

41:17.344 --> 41:19.172
made sure I had it perfect.

41:19.302 --> 41:20.913
Being able to start this
journey

41:21.043 --> 41:22.828
with my son
was pretty awesome,

41:22.958 --> 41:25.613
and I may not be the "Forged
in Fire" champion,

41:25.744 --> 41:28.094
but I think
I represented my family well.

41:30.009 --> 41:31.967
- Ron, congratulations.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.752
You are the
"Forged in Fire" champion

41:33.882 --> 41:36.494
You've led your family
to this position,

41:36.624 --> 41:39.758
and you'll be taking home a
check for $10,000.

41:39.888 --> 41:40.585
Good job, brother.
- Thank you.

41:41.803 --> 41:43.152
It feels spectacular.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.589
From beginning to end,

41:44.719 --> 41:46.199
this has been
a great experience.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.680
Getting to come here
with my daughter, Jessica,

41:48.810 --> 41:50.203
getting to go through this
experience with her,

41:50.333 --> 41:52.379
has been amazing.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.685
So the Hardman house is getting

41:53.815 --> 41:55.251
the "Forged in Fire"
championship.
