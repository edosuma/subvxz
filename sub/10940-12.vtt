WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:02.762
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:02.902 --> 00:04.233
Lou, this is Mackenzie Hutton.

00:04.371 --> 00:05.861
I'm not on a diet.
I'm allergic.

00:06.006 --> 00:06.734
Allergic to what?

00:06.873 --> 00:08.534
Dairy, white sugar,
seafood, gluten.

00:09.075 --> 00:11.066
Ow. There's mosquitoes!

00:11.211 --> 00:12.872
I'd rather marry
my real-estate broker

00:12.979 --> 00:14.571
than be with the moron
that you've wasted

00:14.714 --> 00:15.681
your last five years with.

00:15.782 --> 00:18.342
How we doing tonight?
Not interrupting anything, am I?

00:21.187 --> 00:22.415
My bodyguard has the night off.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.786
I don't know what Mindy told you,

00:24.958 --> 00:26.755
but whatever it was,
it isn't true.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.952
I don't know why it matters.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.892
I mean, everyone knows
you're with Kit.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.391
Where's the nearest
gluten-free bakery?

00:40.473 --> 00:42.805
Hey. Did you get
the gluten-free bread?

00:42.909 --> 00:44.035
I did.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.270
And the all-natural spring water?

00:46.379 --> 00:49.644
Yes. Mackenzie will be able
to take in food and water.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.740
This time, I am prepared
for all of her neuroses.

00:51.851 --> 00:54.649
Man, you know, I can't believe
she's marrying that real-estate guy.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.813
- She's not.
- Excuse me?

00:56.956 --> 00:58.321
She broke up with him.

00:58.491 --> 01:01.460
Oh. And she's engaged to someone
else since she's been here?

01:01.561 --> 01:04.724
Yeah, I know. Pretty fast.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.196
You know,
I don't know how anyone

01:06.299 --> 01:07.857
could live happily ever after
with her.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.629
- She is not all bad.
- Uh-huh.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.637
Okay, she's a nightmare.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.967
But she wants to get married here,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.235
and I am not about
to turn away her business.

01:16.342 --> 01:17.775
Besides, I'm happy for her.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.403
I mean it!

01:21.514 --> 01:24.039
Okay, so, maybe I don't mean it.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.515
Excuse me if I'm a little bit jaded,

01:25.685 --> 01:27.676
but the idea of planning
a Heartland wedding

01:27.787 --> 01:32.224
and building a little love nest
right now makes me want to barf.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.384
How does it look?

01:40.967 --> 01:42.992
She sure is something.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.832
An Andalusian.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.512
Well, Amy, here she is
in all her glory.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.048
Hello. How you doing, girl?

01:57.150 --> 01:59.675
Oh, be careful.
She has been known to bite.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.219
She's beautiful.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.516
Yep, she's beautiful, all right.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.284
People fall for her immediately.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.382
And then as soon as someone
buys her, they return her.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.051
This is her third return.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.392
Why do they bring her back?
What's wrong with her?

02:11.498 --> 02:14.331
Oh, she's cursed.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.459
So, why cursed?

02:16.569 --> 02:18.901
My husband Dan and I bought her
when she was a yearling.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.701
And, I swear, that horse
is one of the main reasons

02:21.808 --> 02:23.207
why he is now my ex-husband.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.243
Just coping with the animal

02:25.345 --> 02:27.973
was the last straw
that ruined my marriage.

02:28.081 --> 02:31.346
We called her Diva Girl,
the divorce horse.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.146
I'm not kidding.
I mean it.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.653
Whoever's on her
has ended up in divorce court.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.484
I think she's cursed.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.582
Luckily, I don't need a cursed horse
to ruin my relationships.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.593
I do that just fine on my own.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.390
Oh.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.727
Well, here comes the bride.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.027
Did you have a good trip?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.295
Yeah, the usual craziness.

02:50.403 --> 02:51.995
Lan missed his flight.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.437
His cab got in an accident
on the way to LaGuardia.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.099
Oh, no. Is he okay?

02:56.209 --> 02:58.234
Yeah, yeah. He's fine.
No worries.

02:58.378 --> 03:01.973
All right, well, hey, let me
just help you with your luggage

03:02.081 --> 03:04.606
Oh, no bags.
They lost all of them.

03:05.385 --> 03:06.181
No!

03:06.286 --> 03:09.221
Yep. Including the one
with my wedding dress in it.

03:09.322 --> 03:13.224
Oh, well, you know what?
You're here.

03:13.326 --> 03:14.691
So we're in good shape, right?

03:14.794 --> 03:16.125
Yeah, whatever. I'm fine.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.787
Really?

03:20.967 --> 03:21.865
Amy.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.196
Oh, my God,
what a beautiful horse.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.534
Careful.
Apparently, she bites.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.199
No, he likes me.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.867
That is so cute.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.272
She. It's a girl.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.176
That horse can smell a wedding
a mile away.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.408
It's the curse at work already.

You know, I don't see
what her problem is.

04:23.529 --> 04:24.860
She seems pretty responsive.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.057
She's on her best
behavior.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.497
She'll act one way
one day

04:28.601 --> 04:29.158
and then

04:29.269 --> 04:30.031
completely
differently

04:30.136 --> 04:30.568
the next.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.537
It's like she's got
a split personality.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.505
My mom called that being "marish."

04:35.608 --> 04:37.576
Well, then,
she's marish.

04:37.677 --> 04:38.871
But she's
a prizewinner,

04:38.978 --> 04:40.275
and she is won'th
a lot of money.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.540
So your mission,

04:41.648 --> 04:43.309
should you wish to accept it,

04:43.416 --> 04:45.384
is to figure out
her moods

04:45.485 --> 04:46.543
and then work
your magic

04:46.653 --> 04:47.813
so that the next
lucky owners

04:47.987 --> 04:50.455
don't bring her back
in a few months.

04:50.556 --> 04:51.648
Well, I will try.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.956
Get rid of the curse if you can
while you're at it.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.689
Oh, and, Amy, you can ride her
and lunge her,

04:57.797 --> 04:58.764
but keep her stabled.

04:58.865 --> 04:59.889
Because if she's out in the field,

04:59.999 --> 05:00.966
she'll get dirty and kicked,

05:01.067 --> 05:02.227
and she really has to look great

05:02.335 --> 05:03.199
if I'm gonna sell her.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.828
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:05.938 --> 05:09.339
Of course, smooches.
Do the best you can.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.932
I miss you, too.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.069
Bye.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.806
He's gonna try to get here tomorrow.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.541
Okay.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.514
No fiancé and no luggage.

05:18.618 --> 05:21.109
Can only get better, right?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.623
What?

05:24.724 --> 05:27.318
No offense, but the old Mackenzie

05:27.427 --> 05:30.021
would be having
a total meltdown right now.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.960
Oh, that Mackenzie's gone.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.193
Ah, Lou, I'd forgotten
how gorgeous it is here.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.859
When I told lan about this place,

05:36.969 --> 05:38.960
we just both knew
we wanted to get married here.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.039
That's sweet.

05:40.139 --> 05:41.629
You know
where I want it to happen?

05:41.741 --> 05:45.108
Right there. Looking out
over the lake at sunset.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.906
That would be perfect.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.844
It'll just be a beautiful,
simple wedding.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.883
No New York craziness.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.008
I'll tell you what.

05:53.119 --> 05:56.384
I promise to make it a day
that you will always remember.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.888
Now, sit down.

05:57.990 --> 06:02.427
I want you to tell me
all about this new fiancé.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.052
He's my hero.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.187
He's my rock.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.424
And he's gorgeous.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.760
Is that all?

06:09.102 --> 06:12.071
I used to want to control everything
all the time, you know,

06:12.171 --> 06:16.232
and lan just makes me
feel spontaneous.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.776
How about you?
You got someone special?

06:19.879 --> 06:23.337
Uh, no. Not right now.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.313
I'm okay with it.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.387
Mm, there's a person out there
for you.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.355
Somebody who's your other half,
like lan is for me.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.389
I don't know.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.823
Yes, there is.

06:33.926 --> 06:37.259
Here's to finding that person.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.132
Ooh, thank you.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.768
Morning.

06:47.273 --> 06:48.831
Where did Lou get to?

06:48.941 --> 06:52.274
She drove Mackenzie
back to the cabins. Why?

06:52.378 --> 06:54.573
No reason.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.942
Come on, now.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.881
I know when there's something
on your mind.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.179
How do you think she's doing?

07:00.286 --> 07:01.651
Good.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.949
Pretty busy organizing
this wedding thing.

07:04.056 --> 07:05.853
She wasrt given much notice.
Why?

07:05.958 --> 07:08.392
She seems...

07:08.494 --> 07:09.290
I don't know.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.793
She seems fine to me.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.990
You're a man. You're not gonna
notice these things.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.430
What things?

07:14.534 --> 07:17.332
Well, her love life
has been rocky lately.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.803
And I don't like
to play matchmaker,

07:19.906 --> 07:22.272
but I've been told
that I am very good at it.

07:22.375 --> 07:26.243
Stop right there.
She does not need a matchmaker.

07:26.345 --> 07:29.712
It's just that this friend of mine
keeps describing this young man

07:29.816 --> 07:31.340
who sounds perfect for her.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.976
Oh, don't go there.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.479
[Sighs]

07:37.490 --> 07:38.218
Girl.

07:38.324 --> 07:40.019
So this is the famous Andalusian.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.754
What's the deal with her?
Other than the curse.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.887
Well, apparently,
she's very changeable.

07:44.997 --> 07:47.727
People fall in love with her
because she's so beautiful,

07:47.834 --> 07:50.826
and then she drives them crazy
with her mood swings.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.837
Beautiful woman, mood swings.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.702
Plenty of experience
with both of those.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.275
Right.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.405
[Horse grunts]

08:00.913 --> 08:01.971
[Horse neighs]

08:02.081 --> 08:04.641
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Easy, girl. Easy, easy, easy.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.245
You know, it's my fault.
It's Spartan.

08:08.354 --> 08:09.252
I mean, he's a gelding,

08:09.355 --> 08:11.516
and sometimes mares are
a little antsy around geldings.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.854
Why don't you calm him down?
I'll take her out to the pen.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.257
Okay.

08:17.763 --> 08:19.253
Come here. Good boy.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.265
Come on.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.866
Nice manners!

08:27.974 --> 08:28.998
Yeah.

08:29.108 --> 08:34.375
I see you really have that moody,
beautiful female thing down.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.251
Hey, Jack,
do you believe in curses?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.010
My mom does.

08:40.119 --> 08:43.554
She has this lucky necklace
that she says wards off evil spirits.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.420
Now she says it wards off
evil booking agents.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.926
[Phone rings]

08:50.062 --> 08:50.790
Hello?

08:51.397 --> 08:55.561
Yes, she is.
Right here. Hang on.

08:55.668 --> 08:56.862
It's your mother.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.797
Oh, my God!
That is so spooky.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.738
Hi.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.538
We were just talking about you.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.703
Really? That's great!

09:07.813 --> 09:08.973
My parents are coming home!

09:10.550 --> 09:13.018
What?

09:13.686 --> 09:15.711
Oh, okay.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.550
Bye.

09:17.657 --> 09:18.715
What?

09:18.824 --> 09:20.689
I thought both my parents
were coming home,

09:20.793 --> 09:21.987
but just my mom is.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.425
Well, that's nice.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.292
No, it's weird.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.525
Why would my mom
be coming home alone?

09:27.633 --> 09:29.100
They're never apart.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.896
Something's going on.
I know something is.

09:31.003 --> 09:34.700
Nothing's going on, Mallory.
She probably just misses you.

09:34.807 --> 09:39.904
It's hard to believe,
but stranger things have happened.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.811
Hey.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.144
Where have you been?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.242
Every time I'm here, you're not.

09:47.386 --> 09:48.580
It works both ways.

09:48.688 --> 09:52.146
That wedding on Saturday,
you know we're all invited.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.453
You should come.
It's gonna be a fun party.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.391
You want me to be
your wedding date?

09:56.495 --> 09:58.326
Couldrt find anybody better?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.991
Apparently not.

10:01.734 --> 10:06.171
I don't do so well at weddings.
I mean, they kind of choke me up.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.364
I'm sure.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.202
Besides, I mean,
I'd have to buy a suit, right?

10:09.308 --> 10:11.299
No, it's totally casual.
You could just...

10:11.410 --> 10:14.345
You could probably just go like that.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.280
Maybe wash first.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.315
You might want to do something
about that hat head, too.

10:19.418 --> 10:22.876
No, it's very attractive.

10:24.023 --> 10:28.119
So, yes or no?

10:28.227 --> 10:31.219
How about I get back to you on that?

10:34.233 --> 10:35.564
That apple crumble
was amazing, Lou.

10:35.668 --> 10:36.566
Good.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.069
Good to see you got
your appetite back.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.032
Oh, coffee, please.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.801
Oh, you know what?
It's not decaf.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.205
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.039
Okay.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.738
My nutritionist is in total shock.

10:48.848 --> 10:52.249
Ever since I met lan,
I don't have any allergies at all.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.319
It's the weirdest thing.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.411
I can eat and drink anything I want.

10:56.522 --> 10:57.580
Wow.

10:57.690 --> 11:01.820
The whole weekend here,
it completely changed my life.

11:01.927 --> 11:06.557
I went home, and I dumped
my boyfriend, and I quit my job.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.224
You did what?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.529
I opened up a little art gallery
in the Village.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.831
Mackenzie, that's amazing.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.872
Lou was my inspiration.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.771
Oh, please!

11:16.876 --> 11:18.867
Why work for somebody else
when you can be your own boss?

11:18.978 --> 11:19.842
Right?

11:19.945 --> 11:21.879
Mackenzie, did you say
your last name was Hutton?

11:21.981 --> 11:22.879
Uh-huh.

11:22.982 --> 11:24.540
Do you know
Elspeth and Riley Penfield?

11:24.650 --> 11:26.777
Oh, my God.
They're my parents' best friends.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.513
I've known them for years.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.384
And I'm certain I've met your parents
at something or another.

11:31.490 --> 11:32.718
June and Ray.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.884
Yes! It's crazy!

11:35.695 --> 11:38.994
Wow, small world.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.935
Mackenzie's parents,
June and Ray Hutton,

11:48.040 --> 11:49.632
they are high society.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.539
And I mean
in the old sense of the word.

11:51.644 --> 11:55.774
Central Park penthouse.
They've got a place in the Hamptons.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.372
Tiny wedding, Lou?
I don't think so.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.714
Mackenzie said
she wants to keep it simple.

12:00.820 --> 12:01.946
She may want to keep it simple,

12:02.054 --> 12:04.887
but simple by Hampton standards
is 250 guests.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.821
And I don't think they mean
our kind of simple.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.292
They mean elegant simple.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.260
But don't worry.
I know these people.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.331
I am here to help.
You can count on me.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.992
Thanks, Lisa,
but I have everything in hand.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.694
I'm fine, really.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.270
Are you sure you're fine?

12:19.705 --> 12:21.605
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

12:21.707 --> 12:23.937
Well, I know you've had
a difficult couple of months.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.944
And this must be hard to have
a friend fall in love and get engaged

12:27.046 --> 12:29.537
and get married right out here
at Heartland.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.206
I'm good with it. Really.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.648
Okay.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.480
So, I'm gonna say something,

12:35.588 --> 12:38.318
and you can tell me to back off
totally as soon as you hear it,

12:38.424 --> 12:42.861
but there's this guy,
and he's not only single, successful,

12:42.962 --> 12:45.726
but he sounds like
he's extremely attractive,

12:45.831 --> 12:47.628
and I think he'd be perfect for you.

12:47.733 --> 12:48.927
Excuse me?

12:50.336 --> 12:52.566
Don't say I said anything.

12:52.671 --> 12:54.195
Okay.

12:54.306 --> 12:56.274
Mackenzie, I wanted
to show you something.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.206
You've made your guest list,
haven't you?

12:58.310 --> 13:00.471
Well, it's not totally settled yet.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.473
I think Lisa just tried to set me up.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.845
Oh.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.650
Look at that.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.022
Yeah, she's being normal.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.094
Man, we're good.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.219
We are good!

13:17.329 --> 13:20.787
You know what?
I've missed this.

13:20.900 --> 13:21.832
Missed what?

13:21.934 --> 13:23.868
Oh, good girl.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.437
This. You know,
working together.

13:26.539 --> 13:31.033
It's just been kind of weird lately,
like, with us, I mean.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.134
What are you talking about?
Speak for yourself.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.769
What? This is not just about me.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.869
Yeah, since when?

13:35.981 --> 13:36.913
It isn't!

13:37.016 --> 13:38.449
You're the one
who's always acting weird,

13:38.551 --> 13:39.518
not to mention moody and...

13:39.618 --> 13:41.848
And, yes?

13:42.555 --> 13:43.613
Nice horse.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.855
So, Amy, that wedding.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.722
If you still haven't found anyone
to take you, I'll do it.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.922
Oh, I feel so special.
Thanks, Caleb.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.824
I've got a way.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.060
Are you still going
to the wedding with Kit?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.330
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:59.438 --> 14:00.598
I am.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.799
Good.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.433
Hey, do you think
she's had enough for now?

14:05.544 --> 14:08.172
Yeah, yeah.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.544
Are you around later to help me?

14:10.649 --> 14:12.116
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.277
Um, Ty?

14:14.453 --> 14:15.385
Yeah?

14:15.487 --> 14:18.251
Am I moody and beautiful?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.556
Shut up.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.787
A barbecue?
Are you serious?

14:23.896 --> 14:26.091
It's not just a barbecue.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.597
Marnie is gonna cater it.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.260
Lou, that's still a barbecue.
For a wedding?

14:30.369 --> 14:33.429
This is what Mackenzie wants.
A simple cookout.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.370
Just like we had on the trail ride.

14:35.507 --> 14:39.238
I'll bet you anything
she has not run this by her parents.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.045
You do know that there's
a 40% chance of rain on Saturday?

14:43.148 --> 14:46.640
I called these guys.

14:46.752 --> 14:50.119
They did the tent at my last do,
and they're really terrific.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.486
And we need a tent because...

14:52.591 --> 14:54.115
You want to seat people
in the rain?

14:54.226 --> 14:57.093
There is a 60% chance
that it won't rain.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.255
And anyways, Lisa, there aren't
a lot of guests coming.

14:59.365 --> 15:03.267
Just Mackenzie's close friends,
her parents, and us, that's it.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.427
Maybe 50.

15:04.536 --> 15:06.060
If it rains, you want a tent.

15:06.171 --> 15:07.832
You're missing the...

15:08.474 --> 15:11.637
Well, it turns out there are not
a lot of shopping choices

15:11.744 --> 15:13.006
in Hudson.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.170
- Have my bags arrived yet?
- No, I'm sorry.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.010
I'm just gonna have
to get married in my jeans.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.608
Well, hey, I have
this great recipe to show you.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.847
Grilled Asian spiced mango chicken.

15:23.956 --> 15:27.016
Lou, there's an eensy change
in plans.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.094
I'm not sure about the barbecue.

15:29.828 --> 15:30.852
Oh?

15:30.963 --> 15:32.453
I just got off the phone
with my mom,

15:32.564 --> 15:35.192
and she has her heart set
on more, like, a sit-down thing.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.030
Okay.

15:37.169 --> 15:39.137
It's not what I wanted,
but I mean, she's my mother.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.138
I can't disappoint her.
I'm her only daughter,

15:41.240 --> 15:43.265
like she reminded me
about a hundred times.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.706
Okay.

15:45.711 --> 15:49.010
Well, Lou has thought of everything.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.479
Take a look at this tent.

15:50.582 --> 15:51.446
Wow.

15:51.550 --> 15:54.485
And with all these little white
twinkly lights, it could be heaven.

15:54.586 --> 15:59.853
I love little white twinkly lights.
That's so pretty.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.460
So, what's the story today, Mom?
Are you coming home or not?

16:04.563 --> 16:06.929
Okay. I love you, too.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.829
So, now my mom says
she's trying to get home,

16:08.934 --> 16:11.903
but she can't get rid of the people
that are renting our house.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.268
Mom and Dad are
somewhere north of Saskatoon.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.465
Maybe I should just go
and see them.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.201
Maybe you shouldn't.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.369
But, Jack, you don't understand.
My mom sounds really sad.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.571
What if...?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.739
What if what?

16:23.849 --> 16:26.682
What if my parents break up?
What if they get a divorce?

16:26.785 --> 16:28.446
What if the curse
works long distance?

16:28.554 --> 16:30.545
Oh, good gravy!

16:30.656 --> 16:32.521
Stranger things
have happened, Jack.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.892
Good gravy.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.199
She seems pretty wary.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.463
I think she's just figuring out
if he's going to hurt her.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.061
Well, they're good for now.
I got to get going, so...

16:47.172 --> 16:49.072
Wait. I thought you said
you were gonna help me.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.267
Well, I am. I mean, I did.

16:51.377 --> 16:52.605
I can't be here 24/7, Amy.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.908
No one's expecting you to be.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.883
I think she's almost enjoying this.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.550
I swear it's that curse she has.

17:06.657 --> 17:07.521
You think?

17:07.626 --> 17:09.423
Yeah, look at her eyes.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.928
She's totally getting to us.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.686
Let's not let her.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.767
All right, I'll help you
when I get back, okay?

17:15.867 --> 17:18.063
- Okay.
- All right.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:22.307 --> 17:26.038
There's that gorgeous horse.

17:26.145 --> 17:28.306
Careful. She is in a mood.

17:28.414 --> 17:29.574
Hi!

17:29.681 --> 17:33.447
Oh, my God, I love this horse.
Is it for sale?

17:33.552 --> 17:34.541
Oh, a horse in New York?

17:34.653 --> 17:36.553
No, I wouldn't keep him
in New York.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.886
Lars family has a ranch in Montana.
That's where he'd live.

17:40.959 --> 17:41.948
Her.

17:44.997 --> 17:45.622
Hello!

17:45.864 --> 17:49.527
Look at these gorgeous wild flowers
I got at the farmers' market.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.365
I figure now that we have tables,
we need centerpieces.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.098
Cute.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.333
Look at these.
Arert they gorgeous?

17:56.442 --> 17:58.910
And they're Mackenzie's
favorite roses.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.003
You'll be glad to know
I got a quote on the tent.

18:02.114 --> 18:04.105
Really reasonable.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.411
Okay.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.611
What's this?
Vickerton and Company?

18:08.720 --> 18:09.812
The caterers.

18:09.922 --> 18:10.911
Marnie is catering.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.856
Lou, Marnie can make
dogs and burgers for 50,

18:13.959 --> 18:16.018
but I don't think she has
the experience or even the staff

18:16.128 --> 18:18.153
to serve 100 guests
filet mignon medium.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.924
Well, I'm glad you have
everything in hand.

18:20.032 --> 18:20.930
No worries.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.661
I said I'd help, and I meant it.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.000
Oh, there's one other thing
I need to clear up with you.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.131
It's about the young man
I talked to you about.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.299
So, here's the deal.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.104
I gave your e-mail address
to my friend,

18:32.211 --> 18:33.701
who, in turn,
gave it to her friend

18:33.812 --> 18:35.939
because that friend has
a fabulous relationship

18:36.048 --> 18:38.482
with a florist who has great prices
on these tea roses.

18:38.584 --> 18:42.020
And as it turns out...
don't be mad...

18:42.121 --> 18:46.285
the friend of a friend
gave the address to her son.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.451
So, you gave out my personal
information to a total stranger?

18:50.062 --> 18:50.858
I'm sorry,

18:50.963 --> 18:54.763
but it had already happened
by the time I found out.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.733
There's a couple
of pretty girls right there.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.566
Hi.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.375
Come on, come on.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.074
You're okay.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.708
Don't worry.
Spartars not here.

19:18.524 --> 19:19.548
Good girl.

19:22.427 --> 19:25.191
Well, thanks for the ride, Kit.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.292
- Come back here!
- Okay.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.924
See you.
Thanks for helping me study.

19:30.035 --> 19:32.265
No problem. Bye!

19:32.371 --> 19:34.430
See you, Kit!

19:41.813 --> 19:43.405
She bit me.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.050
I don't know what got into her.

19:52.157 --> 19:55.593
She was fine outside.
She was calm, good-natured.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.424
And then I brought her in,
and it just happened so fast.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.693
- Ah!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.802
Maybe you should tell Lisa
that this horse is a bit too much.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.530
Well, no. I want to help her.

20:06.638 --> 20:09.334
I mean, she's so angry.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.201
Feel okay?

20:13.312 --> 20:14.506
Yeah.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.013
Thanks.

20:18.984 --> 20:22.647
Can you not tell anyone about this?

20:22.754 --> 20:24.517
Yeah.

20:29.194 --> 20:31.856
Mackenzie!

20:35.100 --> 20:36.829
Smoochie!

20:37.469 --> 20:39.562
Baby!

20:43.308 --> 20:44.832
Oh!

20:48.780 --> 20:52.011
- It's lan!
- Hi.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

20:54.753 --> 20:55.811
- My belt!
- Cabbie!

20:55.921 --> 20:56.353
My belt!

20:56.455 --> 20:57.581
Hey, my belt!

20:57.689 --> 20:59.247
Hey!

20:59.358 --> 21:02.919
Stop! You've got my belt!

21:03.028 --> 21:04.086
Yeah, the last few weeks

21:04.196 --> 21:06.687
have been just a little bit crazy,
actually.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.289
But this ranch...

21:09.401 --> 21:10.333
Wowwee.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.096
- Didrt I tell you?
- Yeah.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.672
Mackenzie couldn't stop
going on about it.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.742
My dad has a place, actually,
in Montana,

21:17.843 --> 21:19.470
and we were gonna have
the wedding there,

21:19.578 --> 21:25.380
but my stepmother got involved,
and everything exploded.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.779
So, I'm just really happy
we chose this place.

21:29.888 --> 21:30.650
Mmm-hmm.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.589
I think you're going to love
what we're doing.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.353
There's going to be
little white lights.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.121
Wow, that's great.

21:37.229 --> 21:41.063
And ivy and white roses
that go all around the tent poles.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.293
So, there's a tent?

21:43.402 --> 21:44.494
Well, in case it rains.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.299
You don't want to have to seat
all those guests outside.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.340
Right. All what guests?

21:50.075 --> 21:52.976
Mom and Dad had a list.

21:53.945 --> 21:55.879
How big is the list?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.414
Under 100.

21:58.016 --> 22:01.179
So, things kind of escalated a bit.

22:01.286 --> 22:02.583
A bit?

22:09.061 --> 22:10.323
Jack, is there more wine?

22:10.429 --> 22:12.397
It's not organic.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.930
Ah, it's okay. Just pour.

22:14.032 --> 22:17.661
I'll actually take a finger or two
of that, too, Jack.

[Computer chimes]

22:31.116 --> 22:34.643
"Okay. I've never done this before,
so bear with me.

22:34.753 --> 22:36.880
Apparently, there are
a few people out there

22:36.988 --> 22:39.422
who are totally convinced
that we should get in touch.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.014
Awkward.

22:41.126 --> 22:42.525
But, hey, I'm all about fate.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.754
I'm also all about putting fate
in motion.

22:44.863 --> 22:45.852
I hope you are, too.

22:45.964 --> 22:48.694
Peter."

22:55.407 --> 22:56.999
Come on! Come on!

23:00.645 --> 23:01.441
Come on!

23:01.546 --> 23:02.945
Come on! Let's go!

23:05.317 --> 23:07.478
Come on!

[Horse neighs]

23:21.767 --> 23:23.598
- Thanks for breakfast, Kit.
- No problem.

23:23.702 --> 23:26.102
- See ya.
- See ya.

23:26.938 --> 23:28.371
Okay, bye.

23:28.473 --> 23:30.270
- Bye.
- She's a great girl, right?

23:30.375 --> 23:32.843
- She sure is.
- She's the best.

23:32.944 --> 23:35.310
If you hurt her,
I'll have to kill you.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.006
You know that, right?

23:37.649 --> 23:39.082
Hey, Amy.
How's it going?

23:39.217 --> 23:40.946
Well, this horse
is making me crazy.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.519
She's just spoiled, that's all.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.452
Turn her out
with the rest of the horses.

23:44.556 --> 23:46.717
Yeah, maybe she's been
so micromanaged,

23:46.825 --> 23:48.315
she hasn't had time
to just be a horse.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.588
- You should let her out.
- I can't.

23:50.695 --> 23:54.495
You know, Lisa told me
to keep her inside, keep her...

23:54.599 --> 23:55.691
Well, keep her clean.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.291
Clean?

24:13.718 --> 24:15.379
You see that?

24:17.422 --> 24:19.754
Need my help, just ask.

24:25.363 --> 24:28.491
Oh, Amy, we're going
to Maggie's tonight.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.125
You should come.

24:36.274 --> 24:38.799
Honey, I can't afford this.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.572
I mean, we can't afford this.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.045
No, of course not. Relax.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.877
My parents are paying for it.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.349
Well, I thought
we were gonna pay for it.

24:47.452 --> 24:49.079
We were going to do it ourselves.

24:49.187 --> 24:53.419
I know, but you know my folks.
I'm their little girl.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.091
Hey.

24:55.193 --> 24:56.990
Hi, Lou.

24:57.095 --> 24:59.757
So, listen, I just have
some last-minute details

24:59.865 --> 25:01.492
to go over with the bride.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.965
Uh-huh.

25:03.068 --> 25:03.830
Seating.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.926
How many replies
have you received?

25:06.037 --> 25:07.402
Oh.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.404
152.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.035
152?

25:12.544 --> 25:13.977
You know my parents.

25:17.315 --> 25:21.376
Honey, we sort of wanted
something really simple

25:21.486 --> 25:23.954
right from the very beginning.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.317
That's why you chose this place.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.414
I mean, 'cause you had
such an amazing time here.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.323
And I mean, I love it here.
Like, I love it.

25:29.427 --> 25:30.894
Great. Me too.
What's the problem?

25:30.996 --> 25:33.760
There's no problem.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.323
I'm not sure why we're having
the same wedding here

25:37.435 --> 25:39.801
that we were trying to avoid
back in the city.

25:39.905 --> 25:41.930
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around that.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.701
- You're not happy?
- No.

25:43.808 --> 25:46.072
I'm happy. I mean, I'm happy.

25:46.177 --> 25:47.576
I'm surprised, that's all.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.414
I'm sorry you feel that way.

25:52.450 --> 25:55.942
Let's just rethink it a little bit.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.154
Yeah, rethinking's good.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.120
Rethink it?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.595
Yeah.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.199
What am I supposed to tell
my parents?

26:09.301 --> 26:10.859
We're gonna have burgers
around a fire

26:10.969 --> 26:12.402
instead of filet under a tent

26:12.504 --> 26:14.768
with little white lights
and tea roses?

26:14.940 --> 26:19.468
Well, they're not the ones
that are getting married, Mack.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.545
Remember? We are.

26:20.645 --> 26:22.010
Yeah, well,
maybe we should rethink it

26:22.113 --> 26:23.410
and not have the wedding at all.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.073
Okay, that's not where I was going.

26:25.183 --> 26:28.243
Well, you did, and now it's ruined.
Everything's ruined!

26:28.353 --> 26:29.581
I will never be able to look back

26:29.688 --> 26:31.883
and have nothing but happy memories
leading up to my day.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.322
Oh, I see.
So now it's "your" day.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.826
It is always the bride's day, lan.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.021
Remember that when I'm standing
there in the pouring rain,

26:39.130 --> 26:41.098
and my hair is plastered
to my head like a wet seal,

26:41.199 --> 26:42.666
and my eye makeup
is running down my face,

26:42.767 --> 26:45.565
and my beautiful dress is drenched
into a white smooshy pulp

26:45.670 --> 26:47.069
all because you couldn't
get your head

26:47.172 --> 26:50.664
around a canopy
and a few tea roses!

26:50.875 --> 26:53.400
Okay.

26:53.511 --> 26:55.672
Okay.

26:55.780 --> 26:59.682
I can totally see
where you're coming from. I do.

27:00.652 --> 27:01.812
You do?

27:01.920 --> 27:03.615
I do. I do.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.083
Good.

27:21.606 --> 27:23.096
Heard from your mother?

27:23.208 --> 27:25.335
No.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.911
I guess no news is good news.

27:28.013 --> 27:29.674
I've made up my mind, Jack.

27:30.281 --> 27:32.613
I'm not just gonna sit around
and wait for a judge to tell me

27:32.717 --> 27:34.344
I'm with my mom
from Monday to Thursday

27:34.452 --> 27:36.147
and with my dad
from Friday to Monday.

27:36.254 --> 27:40.088
Mallory, you are definitely
overreacting to this.

27:40.191 --> 27:41.215
Maybe, maybe not.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.725
But a divorce curse
is still a curse.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.159
It doesn't matter
if it's long distance or not.

27:45.263 --> 27:46.662
I still have to be proactive.

27:46.765 --> 27:48.255
How is that?

27:48.967 --> 27:51.197
I got my ways.

27:54.272 --> 27:55.432
Come here, girl.

27:55.540 --> 27:58.441
Look what I got.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.916
Curse, be gone. Curse, be gone.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.611
Come on.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.847
Curse, be gone.

28:10.955 --> 28:13.719
You'll thank me later.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.597
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.599
Hey, I heard you have
a cursed horse.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.861
It would seem that way, yeah.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.060
Well, we've been working
with her, right?

28:26.171 --> 28:27.160
Yeah.

28:27.272 --> 28:30.571
Yeah, I mean, she's a lot of work,
but she's coming along, right?

28:30.675 --> 28:34.133
And why is that? Huh?

28:34.245 --> 28:36.475
What? You think you had something
to do with it?

28:36.581 --> 28:39.379
I'd say there's not a female on earth
I couldn't figure out.

28:39.484 --> 28:40.917
- Ooh!
- Oh!

28:41.086 --> 28:41.745
Right.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.377
Well, put her out in the field,
I said.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.422
Well, he actually did say that.
That's right.

28:45.523 --> 28:46.547
That's right.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.888
Admit it. It was my call.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.461
Okay, you may have helped
a little bit.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.053
Well, thank you.

28:53.164 --> 28:54.631
You know Caleb
does know his horses.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.200
I swear I was a horse
in another life.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.064
Yeah, and then you came back
as a horse's ass.

28:59.003 --> 28:59.935
Careful.

29:00.038 --> 29:01.437
There we go.

29:02.807 --> 29:05.207
It's Ashley. I swear she calls me
like 10 times a day.

29:05.310 --> 29:05.901
Really?

29:06.010 --> 29:07.637
Yeah, her mom's
still driving her nuts.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.304
Oh, poor baby.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.315
Hey, I like her.
She's a good kid.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.160
It's off.

29:25.864 --> 29:26.853
What's off?

29:26.965 --> 29:27.989
The wedding.

29:28.099 --> 29:28.963
Why?

29:29.067 --> 29:30.762
Well, lan doesn't love me, so...

29:30.869 --> 29:31.460
What?

29:31.569 --> 29:33.059
Better to know that now than later,

29:33.171 --> 29:36.334
so, it's a good thing
in the long run.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.408
Can I use your room?

29:37.509 --> 29:39.136
I can't go back to the cabins
right now.

29:39.244 --> 29:40.142
Yeah, yeah.

29:40.245 --> 29:41.177
Great.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.372
I'm really itchy.
Are there still mosquitoes?

29:43.481 --> 29:45.244
Look, relax, okay?

29:45.350 --> 29:48.649
You go and lay down in my room
and relax.

29:48.753 --> 29:51.916
Don't make any big decisions
right now.

29:52.023 --> 29:54.719
I like that restaurant.
We should go there again.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.722
What's wrong, Lou?

29:59.831 --> 30:02.197
It's off.
The wedding is off.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.460
No! That's impossible.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.331
Everybody's coming
to set up tomorrow.

30:05.436 --> 30:08.200
You know, I don't know
why you're so surprised, Lisa.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.136
Pardon?

30:09.240 --> 30:11.208
You're the one who caused
this whole problem in the first place.

30:11.309 --> 30:11.832
Lou.

30:11.943 --> 30:13.205
No, it's true, Grandpa.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.403
Mackenzie and I, we were fine.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.241
We were planning the wedding
that she wanted.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.815
The wedding that lan wanted, too,
but, no, you got involved,

30:18.917 --> 30:20.578
and everything
just went off the rails.

30:20.685 --> 30:22.710
Tents, flowers, caterers.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.721
I was simply doing
what Mackenzie wanted,

30:24.823 --> 30:26.085
what her parents expected.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.056
No, Lisa, you were doing
what you wanted.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.786
You were interfering
in my business.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.725
And, oh, yes, let's not forget,
in my life.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.390
Giving out my e-mail address
to some guy I don't even know

30:34.499 --> 30:36.364
because my love life
is just so pathetic

30:36.467 --> 30:38.332
that you think I need your help.

30:38.436 --> 30:41.564
Unbelievable!
Like, who do you think you are?

30:41.673 --> 30:43.868
It's just not fair.
I was trying to help.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.636
Well, don't, okay?

30:45.743 --> 30:47.370
Because I don't need your help.

30:47.478 --> 30:50.208
I don't want your help.

31:04.963 --> 31:12.597
I don't know that I have ever
been so disappointed in you.

31:30.788 --> 31:32.915
So, I canceled all the invitations.

31:34.192 --> 31:35.853
I'd pack, but I don't have
anything to pack

31:35.960 --> 31:38.793
since my luggage
never did arrive.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.797
It was a sign right from the start.
A bad omen.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.059
Mallory.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.134
It's okay. She's right.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.760
Hey, do you want some coffee
or something?

31:46.871 --> 31:51.604
No, no. I think that's what's caused
this rash I've got.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.836
Do you have calamine lotion?

31:53.945 --> 31:55.845
Yeah, in the bathroom
under the sink.

31:55.947 --> 31:58.347
Thank you.

31:58.983 --> 32:01.144
It's all my fault.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.446
I tried to remove the curse,

32:02.553 --> 32:06.580
but instead I think
I just reversed it.

32:07.558 --> 32:13.793
Mallory, there are no spells, okay?
There are no curses.

32:13.898 --> 32:15.661
This is not your fault.

32:29.414 --> 32:30.938
Hey.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.516
You're not leaving.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.949
Looks like.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.248
Lan, look, I'm so sorry.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.186
Do you want me to talk to her?

32:39.290 --> 32:43.226
No. No. The joke's over.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.728
I knew it was too good to be true.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.659
Did she tell you how we met?

32:49.767 --> 32:50.734
No.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.326
It's in Gramercy Park.

32:53.438 --> 32:57.534
I never go to Gramercy Park,
but I'm a graphic artist.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.805
I decided to take my sketch pad
and go and work there that day,

33:00.912 --> 33:05.611
and then this girl walks by
with a dog,

33:05.717 --> 33:10.950
and the lyrics
to Billy Joel's "Uptown Girl"

33:11.055 --> 33:12.545
actually went through my head,

33:12.657 --> 33:16.388
and her dog took off
after a squirrel or something,

33:16.527 --> 33:17.687
and she started freaking out.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.592
And I didn't think about it,
I just went after the dog.

33:19.697 --> 33:24.566
And I got him,
and she was blown away.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.867
She called me
her knight in shining armor.

33:28.973 --> 33:31.669
That's sweet.

33:31.776 --> 33:34.336
Yeah, I always thought it was fate
that we met.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.647
Really?

33:36.748 --> 33:37.442
Yeah.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.116
You know,
If I hadrt changed my routine

33:40.218 --> 33:41.549
and gone to the park that day,

33:41.652 --> 33:44.519
I may never have seen her.

33:44.622 --> 33:48.581
I guess it just goes to show
you got to have the courage

33:48.693 --> 33:52.686
to break out of your routine
and be spontaneous.

33:52.797 --> 33:53.764
Seize the day.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.765
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

33:55.867 --> 33:57.334
That's our motto.

33:57.435 --> 34:01.201
Well, it was our motto.

34:31.135 --> 34:33.534
Good girl.

34:33.938 --> 34:37.271
Well, I hate to say it,
but I think Caleb was right.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.867
I guess she just had to spend time
being a horse.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.318
I guess we did it.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.013
Yeah, I guess we did.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.283
You did it? I did it!
I reversed the curse.

34:54.391 --> 34:55.416
What curse?

34:55.525 --> 34:56.822
Well, Lisa's horse.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.828
No. It's nothing.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.789
Hey, girl.

35:03.334 --> 35:04.824
Hey, there.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.428
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hi, guys.

35:08.673 --> 35:09.503
Diva Girl.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.541
Well, she certainly likes you,
doesn't she?

35:11.642 --> 35:12.631
Yeah.

35:12.743 --> 35:17.305
I wish I could take her
back to New York, but I can't.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.816
- See you, guys.
- Yeah.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.555
Why is she in the paddock
with the other horses?

35:25.656 --> 35:27.419
I thought I asked you
to keep her stabled.

35:27.525 --> 35:28.287
I know.

35:28.392 --> 35:29.518
She hates being in a stall.

35:29.627 --> 35:33.563
That's why she's moody,
and that's why she bites.

35:33.664 --> 35:34.392
Look at her.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.990
She loves it out here
just being a horse.

35:37.101 --> 35:38.159
She's happy.

35:38.269 --> 35:41.830
So, you're suggesting
she not be a show horse.

35:41.939 --> 35:44.806
Well, maybe.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.399
I mean, she's just fine now

35:46.511 --> 35:49.002
as long as she's out
with the other horses.

35:49.113 --> 35:51.547
- I'm sorry.
- No.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.139
No, I am glad.

35:53.251 --> 35:55.879
I'm glad you finally figured her out.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.477
Good work.

35:57.588 --> 36:00.284
I guess I'll figure out
what to do with her.

36:04.195 --> 36:06.425
You are making a huge mistake.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.829
Lan loves you.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.264
He's heartbroken.

36:10.368 --> 36:11.596
Really?

36:11.702 --> 36:12.691
Where is he?

36:12.837 --> 36:14.498
He left.

36:14.605 --> 36:16.539
Ha.

36:17.642 --> 36:19.200
Listen to me.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.436
When you came out here,

36:20.545 --> 36:22.672
you knew exactly
how you wanted to get married.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.078
And then you got pushed
in another direction.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.377
But you know what?

36:26.484 --> 36:29.282
Lan was strong enough
to hold on to that dream.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.356
To me, that's a guy won'th keeping.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.856
I know, but it's not gonna happen.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.891
[Door closes]

36:38.596 --> 36:39.756
Hey.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.765
I got your luggage here.

36:44.802 --> 36:47.066
Thanks, Ty.

36:57.715 --> 36:58.875
It's my dress.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.915
It's beautiful and simple,

37:03.054 --> 37:04.783
just like the wedding
was supposed to be.

37:05.790 --> 37:10.318
Oh, Lou,
I made a really big mistake.

37:10.428 --> 37:11.588
Lan was right.

37:11.696 --> 37:14.187
What am I gonna do?
I ruined everything.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.697
It's okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

37:47.965 --> 37:49.796
Is Mackenzie still around?

37:56.240 --> 37:58.333
Mackenzie!

37:58.843 --> 38:00.834
Mackenzie Hutton!

38:00.945 --> 38:04.779
I want you out here right now!

38:07.518 --> 38:09.918
I love you!

38:12.823 --> 38:13.517
Go.

38:13.624 --> 38:16.525
I will marry you wherever
and whenever you want.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.061
You can have 10 tents if you want.

38:19.163 --> 38:22.030
You can invite
anyone you want to.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.601
It's too late for all that.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.999
Everybody...
Our parents have been uninvited.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.216
Lou?

38:41.952 --> 38:43.180
Yes?

38:43.788 --> 38:46.552
Would you be my maid of honor?

38:46.657 --> 38:47.919
I would love to.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.956
Jack, would you be kind enough
to give me away?

38:54.065 --> 38:55.930
It would be my pleasure.

38:57.401 --> 39:00.302
Then, yes, lan Parsons,
I will marry you!

39:06.010 --> 39:08.035
Come here.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.038
Oh, my God!

39:11.148 --> 39:12.137
Baby?

39:13.317 --> 39:14.215
Oh, God.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.910
I'm all right. I'm all right.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.127
Congratulations, man.

39:25.229 --> 39:26.218
Thanks.

39:38.075 --> 39:39.770
- Okay.
- Here she comes.

39:58.929 --> 40:02.456
Lan, today I join my life with yours.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.397
Not just as your husband.

40:04.502 --> 40:05.969
But as a confidant.

40:06.070 --> 40:06.798
Your lover.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.929
And a friend.

40:09.039 --> 40:11.530
I will be the shoulder
that you lean on.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.337
The rock that you rest on.

40:13.477 --> 40:15.570
And the companion of your life.

40:15.679 --> 40:18.443
I promise to love and cherish you.

40:18.549 --> 40:21.416
I will care for you and fight for you.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.146
I will encourage you.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.414
I will comfort you.

40:25.122 --> 40:26.783
I will be myself with you.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.415
And I will be myself with you.

40:28.526 --> 40:32.792
Together, we will seize the day.

40:40.838 --> 40:41.702
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

40:41.806 --> 40:44.297
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

40:45.976 --> 40:50.504
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.627
Turned out to be
a beautiful ceremony.

41:12.736 --> 41:15.170
I'm glad.

41:15.272 --> 41:18.469
Just one thing missing.

41:19.243 --> 41:22.076
What can I say?

41:28.853 --> 41:31.651
She's beautiful.

41:31.755 --> 41:33.313
She's yours.

41:33.424 --> 41:34.914
What?

41:35.025 --> 41:36.515
Call it a wedding present.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.219
- You're kidding.
- Mmm-mmm.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.695
No, Lisa, I couldn't possibly.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.390
Yes, you can.
I want you to have her.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.866
And thanks to Amy,
she's now well-behaved

41:44.969 --> 41:47.631
and she obviously has
a very special affinity with you.

41:47.738 --> 41:51.333
Well, I love her,
but I mean, she costs a lot.

41:51.475 --> 41:53.306
No. I mean, she can't be
a show horse,

41:53.410 --> 41:55.401
so there's no point in selling her,

41:55.513 --> 41:59.108
but the deal is if you breed her,
I must have her firstborn.

41:59.216 --> 42:01.446
- Well, absolutely.
- Okay.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.816
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.825
Well, I hope that's the end
of the curse.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.460
I think so.

42:20.571 --> 42:22.732
What are you so happy about?

42:22.840 --> 42:25.400
Mom's not coming home.
She says my dad needs her.

42:25.509 --> 42:28.171
You see? There was nothing
to worry about.

42:28.279 --> 42:30.611
You have to let things be
sometimes.
