00:42.477 --> 00:45.088
- Or do you not know
that the unrighteous

00:45.132 --> 00:48.091
shall not inherit
the Kingdom of God?

00:49.223 --> 00:51.094
Do not be deceived.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.836
Do not be deceived.

00:53.879 --> 00:58.754
Neither fornicator, nor
adulterer, nor thief,

01:00.190 --> 01:04.151
nor effeminate, nor
homosexual, nor drunkard.

01:05.891 --> 01:08.155
Swindlers, swindlers!

01:10.244 --> 01:11.288
No!

01:13.160 --> 01:16.685
No one shall inherit
the kingdom of the God

01:16.728 --> 01:20.080
without going through
our lord, Jesus Christ,

01:20.123 --> 01:21.733
and the salvation and the grace,

01:21.777 --> 01:23.909
which he put himself
on the cross,

01:23.953 --> 01:28.784
in pain, in blood, for us,
for our flesh, for our sins!

01:31.178 --> 01:33.136
We are who he died for!

01:35.095 --> 01:36.444
- Amen.

01:36.487 --> 01:39.273
- Donate your conscience,
cleanse your soul.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.448
- Thank you, Father,
God bless you.

01:40.491 --> 01:41.318
Bless you, Meredith.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.276
- Father, you're an inspiration.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.494
-  I know, son.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.975
Donate your conscience,
bless your soul.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.325
Donate your conscience,
cleanse your soul.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.231
- He's gone.

03:53.102 --> 03:53.842
He's dead.

04:24.438 --> 04:27.005
- You'll be in room number
three tonight, love.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.363
- Hi.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.024
Yeah.

05:33.550 --> 05:36.423
- Did your daddy ever tell
you you're a fucking whore?

05:42.429 --> 05:43.560
- Let me see your ass.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.351
- Spread your cheeks.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.048
Wider.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.529
- Yeah, spread that shit open.

06:00.925 --> 06:01.752
- What do you wanna
see her do, man?

06:01.796 --> 06:03.275
She'll do anything.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.364
- Touch your pussy, baby.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.369
Come on.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.726
Oh fuck.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.771
- My friend's getting
married next week.

06:23.905 --> 06:27.648
50 bucks, you let him
fuck you in your ass.

06:29.476 --> 06:33.436
- Okay, take your shoe off,
stick the heel in your ass.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.003
- Let me put this
out on your back.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.050
- I want you to take the belt

06:40.312 --> 06:41.444
and choke yourself with it.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.275
Just take it and do it already!

07:03.292 --> 07:04.859
- Spare some change?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.601
- Hello, Charles.
- Hi.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.169
Thank you, thank you.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.041
Thank you.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.436
- Have a good night.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.613
- You're an angel.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.735
-  Dear Grace, I
am writing to inform you

07:54.778 --> 07:57.651
of the passing of your
father, Matthew Hall.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.087
This is an official
notification of death

07:59.130 --> 08:00.871
from the County Clerk's Office.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.656
Should you wish to give
our receptionist a call

08:02.699 --> 08:04.875
and schedule and appointment,
our hours run from 9 a.m.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.399
to 5 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

08:07.443 --> 08:10.533
I apologize for contacting
you under these circumstances.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.057
Please reach out to us at
your earliest convenience.

08:13.101 --> 08:16.626
Best, Tyler Waters,
County Clerk's Office.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.636
- Doesn't it smell pretty?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.511
Mom, she broke my flower.

08:36.646 --> 08:37.473
- Grace.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.478
Which flower do you like best?

08:43.479 --> 08:45.133
Which speaks to you the most?

08:47.614 --> 08:48.745
- That one.

08:49.746 --> 08:50.530
- Pick it.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.152
Now you pull off the stem.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.678
- Why'd you have me do that?

09:08.722 --> 09:09.679
It broke.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.729
- Flowers break
when they're apart.

09:16.686 --> 09:20.429
But together, they are strong.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.696
And you must remember that,

09:27.828 --> 09:30.744
both of you together,
you are strong.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.443
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes, Mother.

11:54.844 --> 11:55.802
- You're here.

11:57.194 --> 11:57.934
- Serena.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.304
- Where did you go?

12:21.305 --> 12:22.480
Why did you leave?

12:24.134 --> 12:26.571
- What do you mean?

12:26.615 --> 12:27.877
Where did you go?

12:29.487 --> 12:33.143
You just ran away without
even saying a word to me.

12:44.676 --> 12:48.419
- You didn't even try
to take me with you.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.771
- He told me you were gone.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.646
I looked everywhere for you.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.998
You just vanished.

13:02.042 --> 13:02.825
- He lied.

13:04.305 --> 13:05.741
He lied to both of us.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.267
He told you I ran away
so you would leave.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.968
- I stayed as long as I could.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.888
I'm so sorry.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.811
Where have you been?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.900
- I've been okay.

13:39.079 --> 13:39.949
You get it.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.953
No one knows I'm here, and
I don't wanna face anyone.

14:12.155 --> 14:12.939
- Hello?

14:27.083 --> 14:27.997
- Can I help you?

14:31.566 --> 14:32.610
- Grace, wow.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.787
I saw a car out front,

14:36.963 --> 14:38.616
I figured I'd take
a chance to stop in.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.055
I've been trying
to track you down.

14:43.273 --> 14:46.363
You're the next of kin
and, well, there's no will.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.018
- Tyler, from the
County Clerk's Office.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.933
Of course, sorry.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.108
Come in, please.

14:52.152 --> 14:52.935
- Thank you.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.638
Yeah, I personally
wanted to let you know

15:00.682 --> 15:02.945
about the passing
of your father.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.774
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.081
Have a seat, please.

15:08.124 --> 15:08.908
- Thank you.

15:12.128 --> 15:15.915
- Can I offer you some
tea or some water?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.092
- Thank you, darling, a
glass of water would be fine.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.328
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.908
So look, the place needs
some pretty extensive work,

15:52.952 --> 15:56.042
obviously, and being by the
highway doesn't exactly help,

15:56.085 --> 15:57.652
but given the amount of land,

15:57.695 --> 15:59.523
I'm sure we could work
out something reasonable,

15:59.567 --> 16:02.700
and I'd be happy to take
it off your hands for you.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.746
It's hard times for
everybody right now.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.010
- Your letter made it seem

16:08.054 --> 16:10.099
like you were writing
me out of compassion.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.623
- Whoa, hold up, hold on.

16:16.366 --> 16:19.065
Yes, I wanted to let
you know, of course.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.634
And I figured you'd
want the estate settled,

16:23.678 --> 16:25.985
and I'm offering to
help you with that.

16:27.290 --> 16:30.163
- This isn't the time for me
to be thinking about this.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.123
I'm just trying to come to terms

16:34.167 --> 16:35.690
with everything that's happened.

16:37.126 --> 16:37.953
- Okay.

16:40.608 --> 16:44.003
Look, let's just not be
too hasty here, okay?

16:48.181 --> 16:51.053
Maybe we just need to get
reacquainted a bit better,

16:51.097 --> 16:52.185
that's all.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.797
- I want you to leave now.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.017
- Oh, Grace.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.458
You don't really
remember me, do you?

17:05.415 --> 17:06.503
- I remember.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.557
- Yes, thank you.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.211
Come then, you shall
see the apartment

17:18.254 --> 17:19.951
I told you you could occupy.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.605
It'll suit you to a marvel.

17:21.649 --> 17:22.563
Out of the way...

17:23.738 --> 17:25.087
What do you think you're doing?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.046
- What do you
mean, what's wrong?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.177
- Knock it off, Tyler.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.838
- Tyler, please, just go.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.144
Just leave.
- Now look.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.931
I have been trying to
track you down for weeks.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.803
I wanted to bury your
piece of shit father

17:45.847 --> 17:48.545
in an unmarked grave, but
I am trying to help you.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.374
So you can move
on with your life.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.986
Lord knows you've been running
from him forever, Grace,

17:55.030 --> 17:56.553
this is not somewhere
you're gonna wanna be.

17:56.597 --> 17:57.946
You don't wanna remember.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.690
- Please, just go now, please.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.832
- For when you
reconsider things.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.341
- Why didn't you help me?

18:46.168 --> 18:48.127
Nevermind, he's gone.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.609
Do you think we
should sell the house?

18:52.653 --> 18:54.176
- Listen, you just got home,

18:54.220 --> 18:56.178
so let's not think
about it right now.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.702
- Maybe it'd be better
if we got a fresh start.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.748
- This is our fresh start.

19:02.402 --> 19:05.796
We don't have to be afraid
anymore of drunken tirades

19:05.840 --> 19:07.450
or the sound of
his leather belt.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.060
- Stop.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.323
-  It got so much
worse after Mom died.

19:10.366 --> 19:13.369
- Stop, stop.
- The welts and the bruises.

19:14.718 --> 19:15.850
- No, please, stop, stop.
- Everything he did to us,

19:15.893 --> 19:18.287
it would hurt so badly.

19:18.331 --> 19:23.205
Grace, do you want me to show
you the welts and bruises?

19:23.249 --> 19:25.729
Then you'll cry for mercy, too.

19:34.042 --> 19:34.825
- Serena?

19:37.350 --> 19:38.307
What happened?

20:04.855 --> 20:08.511
- You're all grown up
now, aren't you, Grace?

20:11.253 --> 20:16.215
I missed you.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.802
- You're awake, sleeping beauty.

20:42.502 --> 20:43.242
- What happened?

20:46.897 --> 20:48.203
How long have I been out?

20:49.073 --> 20:49.857
- A couple hours.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.478
- Is that Mom's
witchcraft stuff?

21:07.483 --> 21:09.920
Where did you find
her spell book?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.313
- In the secret hiding spot.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.361
Remember Mom teaching
us out in the garden?

21:16.840 --> 21:17.885
- Mom.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.408
- It's not moving.

21:23.194 --> 21:23.978
- Here.

21:25.588 --> 21:26.981
Hold your sister's hand.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.332
- I'm scared.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.379
- My sweet, nothing
will happen to you

21:33.422 --> 21:34.815
as long as I'm around.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.166
- Promise?

21:38.209 --> 21:39.646
- Yes, I promise.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.517
- What if you aren't here?

21:42.823 --> 21:44.433
- Then your sister will be.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.134
- Mom, is it dead?

21:50.178 --> 21:52.702
- Nothing is ever gone for good.

22:14.550 --> 22:18.424
Nothing is ever gone for good.

22:20.730 --> 22:21.514
- Hilde?

22:23.907 --> 22:26.040
Hilde, we're here, honey.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.046
We're here, Hilde.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.493
- Take care of the girls.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.715
- Don't leave me, Hilde.

22:52.066 --> 22:56.940
You can't leave me alone.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.422
- You're stronger together.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.556
- Hilde.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.473
Come on, Hilde.

23:10.519 --> 23:11.346
No.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.349
No.

23:16.482 --> 23:20.399
No, no, no, no!

23:21.530 --> 23:22.357
No!

23:23.314 --> 23:24.098
No.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.319
No.

23:31.975 --> 23:35.414
No, no, no.

23:37.459 --> 23:40.941
Please, no.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.551
Don't do this.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.759
Go to your room now.

24:18.805 --> 24:21.329
Are you fucking deaf?

24:21.372 --> 24:22.722
Get out!

24:22.765 --> 24:25.986
Get out, get out,
get out of my sight!

24:27.770 --> 24:31.557
Get out of my sight,
get out of my sight.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.741
- Father told you I ran
away so you would leave.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.615
So you wouldn't find out.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.097
So no one would find out.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.970
That I had missed three periods.

24:56.712 --> 25:01.412
- How did you keep
that a secret from me?

25:01.456 --> 25:04.503
I didn't even know
you had a boyfriend.

25:05.634 --> 25:09.464
- I hid it well.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.726
Father got what he deserved.

25:12.293 --> 25:16.210
Dying slowly, wasting away,

25:18.038 --> 25:20.562
the alcohol rotting him
from the inside out.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.740
- What happened to the baby?

25:24.784 --> 25:26.350
- He's in a better place now,

25:27.613 --> 25:28.527
far away from here.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.225
- What happened?

25:33.096 --> 25:34.794
- I'll tell you about
it another time.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.582
- He just didn't know how
to deal with losing Mom.

25:42.671 --> 25:46.457
I tried to be there for you
and be like she was for you,

25:47.676 --> 25:49.896
but he couldn't cope.

25:49.939 --> 25:53.682
The only way he knew
how was the drinking.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.642
- Grace, he punched me in the
face when I was six years old.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.603
You had to hold a bag of
frozen peas over my eyes

26:01.647 --> 26:03.562
because they were
bruised all over.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.695
You remember that one
time he dragged me

26:06.739 --> 26:08.175
up the stairs by my arm?

26:10.656 --> 26:12.179
- I remember.

26:12.222 --> 26:15.617
- I need your help
to torture his soul.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.577
- Serena, he left this
life as a tortured soul.

26:20.622 --> 26:24.800
- Grace, I need you to
think long and hard.

26:27.673 --> 26:32.242
We used to lay in bed at night,
grasping each other's hands.

26:33.504 --> 26:34.810
We'd chant in our heads.

26:37.683 --> 26:41.251
And we would fly up,
up above our bodies,

26:42.775 --> 26:43.732
into the sky.

26:46.735 --> 26:50.609
We'd hold each other's hands
and fly over the trees,

26:52.915 --> 26:55.614
and to the moon.

26:56.832 --> 26:59.356
And you would just lay there.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.609
- I don't wanna remember!

27:34.653 --> 27:38.569
Nothing happened, it didn't
happen, it didn't happen.

27:38.613 --> 27:39.919
- Even if you can't remember,

27:39.962 --> 27:42.399
or don't wanna believe
that it happened to you,

27:42.443 --> 27:44.575
just know that he
hurt me very badly.

27:45.751 --> 27:46.969
- It was just touching,
it was just touching,

27:47.796 --> 27:48.928
or he would just touch himself.

27:48.971 --> 27:51.931
- What he did to
us was not okay.

27:51.974 --> 27:54.629
He's buried right out back.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.153
You can say your peace to
him without being afraid.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.720
You can yell at him,
you can tell him

27:58.764 --> 28:00.026
how you really feel.
- I wish I'd come back

28:00.069 --> 28:02.855
when he was still alive,
so I could make him feel

28:02.898 --> 28:04.639
all the pain that
he made you feel.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.814
- We can bring him back.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.990
We can make him pay.

28:08.861 --> 28:09.949
- Bring him back?

28:11.124 --> 28:11.907
How?

28:13.126 --> 28:15.737
- When night falls dark
and all goes black,

28:16.782 --> 28:17.739
we chant our spell,

28:19.306 --> 28:20.916
and bring what's gone back.
- Bring what's gone back.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.876
- A soul so vile,
wretched and wrong,

28:23.919 --> 28:26.879
we curse it back
through this song.

28:26.922 --> 28:29.795
Never to rest,
longing for sleep,

28:29.838 --> 28:32.101
from the depths of the
earth, clinging to grief.

28:47.769 --> 28:48.944
- Where is he?

28:49.815 --> 28:50.729
- Right there.

29:08.790 --> 29:09.748
- It's okay.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.265
- Now what?

29:49.309 --> 29:50.963
- Well, now we need to
intone a resurrection spell,

29:52.312 --> 29:54.705
bring his soul
back into his body,

29:56.664 --> 29:57.926
and make him pay.

29:58.884 --> 30:02.931
- Can we really, can
we really do this?

30:04.933 --> 30:07.544
This isn't exactly
a cute little mouse

30:07.588 --> 30:08.850
we're dealing with here.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.245
- We're dealing with pure evil.

30:15.683 --> 30:18.512
We're gonna need a spell
book, more candles,

30:18.555 --> 30:20.514
a chalice, and an athame.

30:20.557 --> 30:21.341
- Agreed.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.911
But first things first,
we need some incense,

30:25.954 --> 30:27.303
'cause the smell is awful.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.829
- Yeah, I think there's
some in this drawer.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.019
- I'll go get
everything we need.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.407
- And a razor!

32:12.191 --> 32:13.670
Don't forget a razor.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.037
Here you go.

32:46.877 --> 32:48.140
All these candles remind me

32:48.183 --> 32:50.055
of when Father didn't
pay the power bill.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.318
- I remember that time.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.453
They got in a huge argument.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.848
When he hadn't paid the bill.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.594
He punched her in the face
and gave her a black eye.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.904
Do you remember, we were
all just huddled with Mom

33:14.688 --> 33:15.645
in the bathroom?

33:18.170 --> 33:21.129
She was just holding
us in the bathtub.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.920
He was banging down the door.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.012
- It's okay, it's okay.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.189
- Hilde, open the door now!

33:40.192 --> 33:44.022
Open the fucking
god damn door now!

33:44.065 --> 33:46.546
Open the door, open the door!

33:54.119 --> 33:55.076
Honey.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.948
Come on, it was an accident.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.995
That was an accident.

34:09.003 --> 34:11.092
- That's just one more reason
we're gonna make him pay

34:11.136 --> 34:12.137
for what he did to us.

34:15.575 --> 34:17.229
- I wish we could
bring her back,

34:18.360 --> 34:20.275
erase all the suffering
she went through.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.974
- She'll be vindicated
when we make him suffer.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.113
- We need to draw a pentacle

34:32.157 --> 34:33.810
and place him in
the center of it.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.204
- Yes, but it has to be drawn

34:36.248 --> 34:38.206
with a mixture of
blood and tears.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.774
The ritual is most
effective using the fluids

34:40.817 --> 34:42.384
of the firstborn sister.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.822
- Well that would be me.

35:23.643 --> 35:26.254
- Goddesses of the dark arts,

35:26.298 --> 35:29.518
we implore you to bless
this cathartic enterprise,

35:29.562 --> 35:32.086
so that we may have peace
and be freed from the pain

35:32.130 --> 35:35.133
that would otherwise lead
to our own souls' demise.

35:35.176 --> 35:38.179
With firstborn's red blood
and tears fresh from eyes,

35:38.223 --> 35:41.443
we beseech thee to empower
this potion derived.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.316
Blood gathered at
new cycle start,

35:44.359 --> 35:47.275
shedding anew and
tears crystal clear

35:47.319 --> 35:48.494
as morning's fresh dew.

35:59.896 --> 36:02.160
- We call forth
the power of air.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.730
We call forth the
power of earth.

36:17.218 --> 36:22.180
We call forth the
power of water.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.535
We call forth the power of fire.

36:48.336 --> 36:52.253
We beseech thee, oh mystical
elements, on this night,

36:52.297 --> 36:55.387
and harness your power,
your darkness, your light.

36:55.430 --> 36:58.738
Now night's fallen dark
and all has gone black,

36:58.781 --> 37:01.784
we chant our spell and
bring what's gone back.

37:01.828 --> 37:04.265
A soul so vile,
wretched and wrong,

37:04.309 --> 37:06.615
we curse thee back
through this song.

37:06.659 --> 37:09.357
Never to rest,
longing for sleep,

37:09.401 --> 37:12.230
from the depths of the
earth, clinging to grief.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.711
We conjure your soul,
return from the dead,

37:15.755 --> 37:19.324
with the plunge of this knife,
our words in their stead.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.296
- Make it stop!

37:35.340 --> 37:37.211
Put it back, put it back!

37:37.255 --> 37:38.430
- We can't, we can't,
I can't find any spell

37:38.473 --> 37:40.127
to trap his soul
back into his body.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.824
- There has to be something.

37:41.868 --> 37:43.304
- We can try forcing his
soul back into his body,

37:43.348 --> 37:45.350
but we risk losing him forever.

37:45.393 --> 37:47.177
-  We don't
have any choice!

37:47.221 --> 37:48.527
- No, I'm not losing
my only chance

37:48.570 --> 37:50.398
of making him pay for
what he did to us.

37:50.442 --> 37:53.096
- You have to put him
back, put him back!

37:54.968 --> 37:56.535
- Okay, there's a binding spell.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.319
We could trap his spirit
into another vessel.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.452
- Other body, Serena,
we don't have that!

38:00.495 --> 38:02.323
- No, just any kind of object.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.021
I don't know, just a
doll, go get a doll!

38:10.462 --> 38:12.333
- Please do it, do it now!

38:12.377 --> 38:15.380
- We send you back, not
from whence you came,

38:15.423 --> 38:16.946
to be trapped inanimate.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.209
Soul so dark, without
beating heart.

38:19.253 --> 38:23.475
Your powers dwindling, until
our magic tears you apart.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.738
We curse you now to
be trapped within,

38:25.781 --> 38:28.523
unable to escape,
wreak havoc, your sin.

38:28.567 --> 38:30.830
We curse you now to
be trapped within,

38:30.873 --> 38:34.312
unable to escape,
wreak havoc, your sin!

38:49.631 --> 38:50.502
- Now what?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.026
- I don't know.

38:54.288 --> 38:55.985
We figure out a way
to put his soul back

38:56.029 --> 38:58.031
into another person's body.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.599
- Oh great, I'll just
go round up another body

39:00.642 --> 39:02.340
and we'll be good to go.

39:03.558 --> 39:06.039
- Yeah, that didn't
exactly go as planned.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.216
- Maybe we could do a
variation of the spell

39:09.259 --> 39:10.130
and make it work.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.740
- The book specifically said

39:11.784 --> 39:14.439
that the spell could only be
used once with the same body.

39:17.877 --> 39:18.834
- I'm exhausted.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.664
Let's try to figure
this out in the morning,

39:22.708 --> 39:26.015
there's nothing else we
can possibly do tonight.

40:28.251 --> 40:33.256
- Serena, lift up
your sister's dress.

40:39.045 --> 40:41.395
Are you dumb, girl?

40:41.439 --> 40:42.178
Huh?

40:43.484 --> 40:46.661
When I tell you to do
something, you do it.

40:49.925 --> 40:52.319
Lift up your sister's dress.

42:08.743 --> 42:11.616
Don't leave me, Hilde.

42:11.659 --> 42:14.532
-  You're
stronger together.

42:38.643 --> 42:39.818
- I never come in here.

42:41.036 --> 42:42.603
I don't know why
you would want to.

42:42.647 --> 42:43.648
- I don't know.

42:45.214 --> 42:48.478
I guess I just wanted to see
if everything was the same,

42:48.522 --> 42:50.785
and it is.

42:51.786 --> 42:54.789
Everything is exactly
the way I remembered it.

42:56.530 --> 42:58.227
- That was Mother's
favorite dress.

43:00.229 --> 43:02.623
- She was only 18
when she married Dad.

43:13.895 --> 43:15.680
-  She was
always so beautiful.

43:16.724 --> 43:17.725
- She was.

43:20.249 --> 43:21.599
- You look a lot like her.

43:23.513 --> 43:24.602
- I do, don't I?

43:41.096 --> 43:42.750
Serena, I'm sorry.

43:44.056 --> 43:45.057
For the touching,

43:46.536 --> 43:48.669
for the things that
Father made me do to you.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.847
- We both had to do
things to each other.

43:54.414 --> 43:55.633
It was a matter of survival.

43:57.199 --> 43:59.462
He made me do things
to you, too, remember?

44:00.594 --> 44:02.640
- I don't really wanna remember.

44:02.683 --> 44:05.294
I keep getting flashes
of memories, but--

44:05.338 --> 44:06.687
- I remember it quite well.

44:07.819 --> 44:08.776
Every little detail.

44:10.430 --> 44:13.433
- I think it's better to just
keep it locked in the past.

44:14.434 --> 44:15.653
- I'm glad I remember it.

44:16.915 --> 44:18.438
It wasn't all so bad.

44:19.657 --> 44:23.661
Even bad times
ended up being okay.

44:25.967 --> 44:27.621
- Ended up being okay?

44:29.101 --> 44:34.106
- Sometimes you would
touch me, and it felt good.

44:35.716 --> 44:36.804
I think you liked it, too.

44:38.414 --> 44:40.025
I mean, not the
way Father did it.

44:42.462 --> 44:44.464
But the way we did
things to each other.

44:47.989 --> 44:51.210
And you really liked it when
I would kiss you softly,

44:53.168 --> 44:53.952
like this.

45:02.482 --> 45:04.179
And I really liked it

45:08.793 --> 45:11.056
when you would do this to me.

45:46.569 --> 45:50.922
-  Serena,
lift up your sister's dress.

47:41.467 --> 47:43.556
- Drunk before
dinner again, huh?

47:44.339 --> 47:45.210
- No, no, sir.

47:48.909 --> 47:51.085
- Why don't you
just cut the shit?

47:53.305 --> 47:56.917
This is why you
still live at home.

47:59.093 --> 48:00.703
You're an embarrassment!

48:01.966 --> 48:04.882
You've been around the
Hall house, haven't you?

48:04.925 --> 48:06.100
Haven't you?

48:06.144 --> 48:07.188
- I'm sorry, sir, I
just wanted to see her.

48:07.232 --> 48:08.059
- Oh yeah?

48:09.408 --> 48:10.888
And how'd that work out for you?

48:12.846 --> 48:15.457
You told her about
the money, didn't you?

48:15.501 --> 48:16.241
- No, sir.

48:19.026 --> 48:21.899
- I told you not to
fucking go over there!

48:21.942 --> 48:23.726
- I had to for my job.

48:23.770 --> 48:26.599
- No, you disobeyed
a direct order!

48:28.253 --> 48:29.210
- Dad, please.

48:29.254 --> 48:31.865
- No, please nothing.

48:31.909 --> 48:34.868
What did I tell you
about respect, boy?

48:34.912 --> 48:37.044
- Respect is received
when it's earned.

48:37.088 --> 48:39.351
- You not listening to me
when I tell you something

48:39.394 --> 48:40.918
isn't respecting me, is it?

48:40.961 --> 48:41.962
- No.

48:44.008 --> 48:45.270
- What was that?
- No, sir.

48:49.274 --> 48:51.102
- You stay away from that house.

48:53.017 --> 48:55.367
I don't wanna tell
you that ever again.

48:57.064 --> 48:58.109
Ever!

49:21.610 --> 49:22.829
- What are you drawing?

49:27.181 --> 49:27.965
- You.

49:32.186 --> 49:34.275
- Have you eaten any
of those mushrooms?

49:36.538 --> 49:37.757
- No, not yet, why?

49:39.106 --> 49:41.108
- Because I think
they're the magical kind.

49:44.024 --> 49:45.330
- Thanks for the warning.

49:46.418 --> 49:48.507
- You're welcome.

49:48.550 --> 49:52.685
- There's a whole other
bowl of those downstairs.

49:57.168 --> 49:58.169
Act natural.

50:00.127 --> 50:02.608
Pretend I'm not here.

50:02.651 --> 50:03.391
- Okay.

50:05.437 --> 50:08.875
- You know, I have
stacks of pictures

50:08.918 --> 50:10.964
that I've drawn of
you over the years.

50:11.008 --> 50:11.965
- You do?

50:12.009 --> 50:13.010
Can I see them?

50:13.053 --> 50:14.837
- You can see them
when I'm done.

50:16.100 --> 50:16.926
Stop moving.

50:24.064 --> 50:27.328
- It feels like we've
never been apart.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.069
- It does.

50:31.245 --> 50:35.336
- All I've ever wanted
was for us to be together.

50:38.209 --> 50:43.170
- Together.

50:44.476 --> 50:46.130
We're together now.

50:51.526 --> 50:52.701
What was that?

50:53.876 --> 50:56.140
- Maybe the spell
worked, and it's Father.

50:57.532 --> 50:59.969
- I think somebody's downstairs.

51:44.449 --> 51:46.625
Don't move from this spot.

52:24.315 --> 52:25.794
- Where is it?

52:38.416 --> 52:39.199
- Serena.

52:59.045 --> 53:00.177
- Ow!

53:40.826 --> 53:41.609
- Tyler.

53:50.270 --> 53:51.445
- Holy shit.

53:53.012 --> 53:55.275
Well, looks like
we found our body.

53:55.319 --> 53:57.408
- No, we can't use him.

53:57.451 --> 54:00.019
- Of course we can, and we will.

54:00.062 --> 54:02.151
- I thought we needed a corpse.

54:02.195 --> 54:03.544
- No, he'll do.

54:05.198 --> 54:06.155
- Serena, we can't.

54:09.333 --> 54:11.422
- Don't you wanna get
back at this asshole?

54:11.465 --> 54:12.597
- I do, I do, but...

54:25.436 --> 54:27.351
- Remember all that anger
you had the other night?

54:27.394 --> 54:28.439
Remember that?

54:28.482 --> 54:29.744
What happened?

54:29.788 --> 54:30.745
Look at it.

54:30.789 --> 54:31.659
Look at it!

54:35.707 --> 54:38.100
You know, they're
all the fucking same,

54:39.276 --> 54:42.235
just taking advantage
of all the women.

54:42.279 --> 54:45.412
All of them, just
all the fucking same.

54:45.456 --> 54:46.761
- You don't know that.

54:46.805 --> 54:48.676
- Why the fuck do
you think he's here?

54:49.982 --> 54:52.985
Really, why the fuck
do you think he's here?

54:54.421 --> 54:56.771
- So what am I supposed
to do with him?

54:56.815 --> 54:58.947
- I don't know,
teach him a lesson.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.822
And then we can put
Father's soul into his body.

55:06.346 --> 55:07.129
- Yes.

55:12.613 --> 55:14.093
-  Give him
some of those mushrooms,

55:14.136 --> 55:15.877
it'll be easy for
you to manage him.

55:22.406 --> 55:23.581
- What the fuck?

55:24.843 --> 55:26.279
- Did you really think

55:26.323 --> 55:28.673
that you could just
break into my house?

55:33.547 --> 55:35.332
- What the fuck is that?

55:35.375 --> 55:36.681
What is that, blood?

55:39.248 --> 55:40.554
Oh god, okay.

55:40.598 --> 55:41.381
Okay.

55:42.948 --> 55:45.472
I don't know what the hell
this is, but my father,

55:45.516 --> 55:47.387
my father's gonna
be looking for me.

55:47.431 --> 55:49.476
And he knows I've been
hanging around here,

55:49.520 --> 55:51.870
so you just tell me where
the money is, and I'll leave.

55:51.913 --> 55:54.002
- Your father knows that
you broke into my home?

55:54.046 --> 55:56.396
What are you talking about,
there's no money here.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.355
- Don't play stupid, Grace.

55:58.398 --> 56:00.966
The money, the money your
father stole from the parish.

56:01.009 --> 56:03.185
There's a lot of it,
and I'm gonna find it.

56:03.229 --> 56:05.318
- If my father had
stashed any money here,

56:05.362 --> 56:07.102
why would I let
you just take it?

56:08.669 --> 56:12.238
- I'm gonna get my hands on
that money, one way or another.

56:13.544 --> 56:17.156
No, no, please, please,
you can't do this.

56:17.199 --> 56:18.549
- Sure I can't.

56:18.592 --> 56:20.551
You broke into my home.

56:20.594 --> 56:22.509
- I wasn't gonna
do anything, okay?

56:22.553 --> 56:25.817
I just wanted to scare you
a little and get the money,

56:25.860 --> 56:28.123
because I have to
get away from him.

56:29.168 --> 56:31.605
I have to get, I have to get...

57:05.944 --> 57:06.727
Slave!

57:09.600 --> 57:11.036
I'm inside life!

57:16.650 --> 57:17.434
- Tyler.

57:21.568 --> 57:23.048
Tyler.

57:23.091 --> 57:23.875
- Tyler.

57:38.542 --> 57:39.368
- Tyler!

57:53.644 --> 57:54.471
- Sunflowers.

57:55.863 --> 57:58.910
Pink type.

57:58.953 --> 58:00.477
-  Did you
find the spell?

58:03.567 --> 58:04.481
- It looks like our spell boy

58:04.524 --> 58:06.265
has turned into sleeping beauty.

58:08.528 --> 58:10.530
- Out like a light, huh?

58:10.574 --> 58:13.664
Do you think it's true, what
he said about the money?

58:13.707 --> 58:15.317
- I don't know.

58:15.361 --> 58:19.104
I remember kids talking about
it, but I never believed them.

58:27.591 --> 58:28.722
Now for the hard part.

58:30.942 --> 58:32.726
Are you ready for this?

58:32.770 --> 58:34.815
Are you prepared to do
what needs to be done?

58:34.859 --> 58:38.863
- I know we won't have any
peace until we do this.

58:45.609 --> 58:47.132
Do you think it'll hurt him?

58:47.175 --> 58:50.004
- Once Father is inside of
him, Tyler won't feel a thing.

58:51.745 --> 58:54.618
He won't have any
recollection of it, either.

58:54.661 --> 58:57.751
And then we can ask
Father where the money is.

59:00.406 --> 59:05.280
- But before we put his
spirit into this body,

59:05.324 --> 59:07.718
will he be aware of
what's happening?

59:09.067 --> 59:11.548
- I'm sure there'll be some
pain, but we have to do it.

59:15.682 --> 59:17.554
Are you prepared
to restrain him?

59:21.688 --> 59:22.515
- Yes.

59:24.299 --> 59:26.301
I can see that it's necessary.

59:27.955 --> 59:30.131
- Once you have him
secure, we'll start.

59:36.181 --> 59:37.225
- You don't think
there's a chance

59:37.269 --> 59:39.488
it could kill him, do you?

59:40.968 --> 59:41.752
- I don't know.

59:43.057 --> 59:43.928
I don't think so.

59:45.407 --> 59:46.365
But does it matter?

59:47.758 --> 59:48.802
We have to do this.

59:51.762 --> 59:53.851
- Is this really the only way?

59:55.069 --> 59:58.986
- Grace, Father made
us eat our own vomit.

1:00:00.509 --> 1:00:02.947
Do you understand, we
would lay in bed at night

1:00:04.165 --> 1:00:06.515
with so much anxiety
for what he did to us?

1:01:00.874 --> 1:01:01.658
- Help me.

1:01:12.843 --> 1:01:17.282
- Are you really gonna make
me do all this by myself?

1:01:17.325 --> 1:01:18.805
Don't you wanna help me?

1:01:19.850 --> 1:01:21.721
- You're the
firstborn, remember?

1:01:23.201 --> 1:01:25.725
And besides, I'll
need to translate the
spell and guide you.

1:01:28.989 --> 1:01:32.514
- I wanna make up for the
times I didn't protect you.

1:01:33.907 --> 1:01:35.256
- It's not your fault.

1:01:36.780 --> 1:01:38.390
You need to do this.

1:01:39.434 --> 1:01:41.306
We need to do this.

1:01:42.437 --> 1:01:44.831
- I really hope this works.

1:01:46.746 --> 1:01:47.486
- Me too.

1:01:50.707 --> 1:01:52.883
Then we'll finally be
free from this misery.

1:01:55.407 --> 1:01:57.670
Okay, get the feet.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:58.453
Let's begin.

1:02:00.455 --> 1:02:01.195
- Tyler.

1:02:02.544 --> 1:02:03.720
I'm sorry, son.

1:02:16.167 --> 1:02:17.690
- We need to
incorporate the powers

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:19.300
of air, earth, water, and fire,

1:02:20.171 --> 1:02:21.650
along with blood and semen.

1:02:22.913 --> 1:02:25.959
- My monthly blood and his
seed are in the chalice.

1:02:26.003 --> 1:02:27.656
- Good.

1:02:27.700 --> 1:02:30.703
With firstborn's red blood
and tears fresh from eyes,

1:02:30.747 --> 1:02:33.924
we beseech thee to empower
this potion derived.

1:02:33.967 --> 1:02:36.535
Blood gathered at cycle
start, shedding anew.

1:02:38.232 --> 1:02:40.539
- This is actually gonna
work this time, isn't it?

1:02:40.582 --> 1:02:43.281
- Yes, we're putting an
old soul into a new body.

1:02:46.719 --> 1:02:48.286
We call forth the power of air.

1:02:48.329 --> 1:02:50.288
- We call forth
the power of air.

1:02:50.331 --> 1:02:52.725
- We call forth the
power of blood and life.

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:55.815
- We call forth the
power of blood and life.

1:02:55.859 --> 1:02:57.512
- We call forth
the power of earth.

1:02:57.556 --> 1:02:59.819
- We call forth
the power of earth.

1:02:59.863 --> 1:03:01.865
- We call forth
the power of water.

1:03:01.908 --> 1:03:03.954
- We call forth
the power of water.

1:03:04.911 --> 1:03:07.218
- We call forth
the power of fire.

1:03:07.261 --> 1:03:10.047
- We call forth
the power of fire.

1:03:12.963 --> 1:03:15.835
- We cleanse this living soul
to lie dormant and restrained,

1:03:15.879 --> 1:03:17.794
as we replace it with another's.

1:03:17.837 --> 1:03:19.796
A soul now lying in wait.

1:03:19.839 --> 1:03:23.060
You are purified of remnants
of earthly consciousness.

1:03:24.713 --> 1:03:26.803
For the remainder of
the penance we inflict

1:03:26.846 --> 1:03:29.327
on your body's new tenant,
we relegate your soul

1:03:29.370 --> 1:03:32.852
to the dark recesses in
between both light and dark,

1:03:32.896 --> 1:03:34.898
to keep it safe
until it can be seen.

1:03:34.941 --> 1:03:37.596
We call forth the
goddesses of the dark arts,

1:03:37.639 --> 1:03:39.859
with all of the longing
deep in our hearts.

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:42.427
Release you from binding,
to live in new skin.

1:03:42.470 --> 1:03:45.212
Release you from binding,
to live in new skin.

1:03:45.256 --> 1:03:47.867
Release you from binding,
to live in new skin.

1:03:47.911 --> 1:03:50.174
Release you from binding,
to live in new skin.

1:03:50.217 --> 1:03:53.742
Release you from binding,
to live in new skin.

1:04:20.944 --> 1:04:22.815
- Well hello, girls.

1:04:26.036 --> 1:04:27.080
Grace.

1:04:28.821 --> 1:04:29.996
It's been a very long time.

1:04:31.476 --> 1:04:32.912
- Not nearly long enough.

1:04:34.783 --> 1:04:36.524
- What's the matter?

1:04:36.568 --> 1:04:38.135
Were you afraid to come back?

1:04:49.798 --> 1:04:52.062
That's not very nice, Grace!

1:04:52.105 --> 1:04:53.933
Is that any way to
treat your father?

1:04:55.152 --> 1:04:57.719
- You were a poor
excuse for a father.

1:04:57.763 --> 1:04:59.286
- Didn't I provide for you?

1:05:00.853 --> 1:05:03.029
Clothe you, feed you, I
put a roof over your head.

1:05:03.073 --> 1:05:04.726
- You hurt us!

1:05:04.770 --> 1:05:05.945
You hurt us all!

1:05:05.989 --> 1:05:07.947
You abused us!

1:05:14.911 --> 1:05:16.913
How does that feel, hm?

1:05:16.956 --> 1:05:20.699
How does it feel to
be completely helpless

1:05:20.742 --> 1:05:22.440
and subjected to pain?

1:05:22.483 --> 1:05:26.009
- God, you were
always so ungrateful!

1:05:26.052 --> 1:05:27.488
I gave you discipline.

1:05:27.532 --> 1:05:30.013
I took care of you
after your mother died.

1:05:30.056 --> 1:05:33.277
- I wouldn't call what
you did taking care of us.

1:05:40.066 --> 1:05:41.024
- God damn it!

1:05:42.286 --> 1:05:43.852
-  He's healing?

1:05:43.896 --> 1:05:46.159
- He can feel it, but it's
not showing any marks.

1:05:49.032 --> 1:05:50.033
- Serena.

1:05:52.383 --> 1:05:56.343
There she is, my sweet,
perfect little girl.

1:05:56.387 --> 1:05:58.955
- Don't you dare talk to her

1:05:58.998 --> 1:06:03.829
as if you were some loving,
virtuous parental figure!

1:06:07.572 --> 1:06:10.705
- That's it, Grace,
make him understand.

1:06:10.749 --> 1:06:12.969
- I did the best I
could with you girls.

1:06:13.882 --> 1:06:15.972
I raised you with a firm hand,

1:06:16.015 --> 1:06:17.538
the way my father did with me.

1:06:17.582 --> 1:06:18.931
- Shut up!

1:06:21.499 --> 1:06:23.762
I don't understand
how there's no mark.

1:06:23.805 --> 1:06:24.719
There's nothing.

1:06:33.163 --> 1:06:34.251
- He can feel it,
but it's showing up

1:06:34.294 --> 1:06:35.774
on the corpse, not Tyler.

1:06:37.210 --> 1:06:37.994
- What?

1:06:42.476 --> 1:06:44.652
Oh my god.

1:06:44.696 --> 1:06:46.393
- There is no god.

1:06:48.091 --> 1:06:49.614
I spent my whole
life serving God,

1:06:49.657 --> 1:06:51.659
just to find out
he doesn't exist.

1:06:53.792 --> 1:06:55.446
- Of course he doesn't.

1:06:55.489 --> 1:06:57.535
Because no god would
have ever allowed you

1:06:57.578 --> 1:07:00.233
to do the things that you
did to our mother and us.

1:07:00.277 --> 1:07:02.801
- If there was a god, he
would cast you into Hell

1:07:02.844 --> 1:07:04.585
for desecrating my corpse!

1:07:11.897 --> 1:07:16.902
- The only person that
deserves to rot in hell is you.

1:07:19.122 --> 1:07:21.428
- Good thing you don't
believe in God anymore,

1:07:21.472 --> 1:07:22.908
because I sure as hell don't!

1:07:35.007 --> 1:07:36.661
- Grace, please.

1:07:37.618 --> 1:07:39.577
Let's just say that if the god

1:07:39.620 --> 1:07:42.275
that I raised you to
believe in did exist,

1:07:43.842 --> 1:07:45.931
he would tell you to turn
the other cheek, right?

1:07:45.974 --> 1:07:46.758
Wouldn't he?

1:08:09.476 --> 1:08:11.739
- What was it you always
liked to say to us?

1:08:13.001 --> 1:08:15.787
Spare the rod, spoil the child?

1:08:17.267 --> 1:08:21.271
- Because you're a
miserable piece of shit.

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:27.233
- Please, please.

1:08:27.277 --> 1:08:30.149
You have a chance
to show me mercy.

1:08:30.193 --> 1:08:32.195
Like I never showed you.

1:08:32.238 --> 1:08:33.979
Like my father never showed me.

1:08:35.198 --> 1:08:37.200
- Do you really think because
your father abused you,

1:08:37.243 --> 1:08:40.855
that gives you any excuse
for what you did to us?

1:08:40.899 --> 1:08:42.509
- You never showed us any mercy.

1:08:42.553 --> 1:08:45.556
You never heard
our cries to stop!

1:09:01.876 --> 1:09:03.748
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

1:09:03.791 --> 1:09:05.358
What the fuck did you just say?

1:09:06.577 --> 1:09:10.711
- That was for what
you did to our mother.

1:09:12.974 --> 1:09:14.628
- Please, I was a sick man.

1:09:16.413 --> 1:09:17.979
I have a disease.

1:09:18.806 --> 1:09:20.286
It was the alcohol.

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:23.594
- The alcohol.

1:09:25.248 --> 1:09:27.163
Yeah, I remember.

1:09:27.206 --> 1:09:28.164
The alcohol.

1:09:29.469 --> 1:09:34.474
I remember the smell of
alcohol on your breath

1:09:35.693 --> 1:09:38.783
as you hovered over us.

1:09:39.697 --> 1:09:42.003
- Hovering over you and what?

1:09:43.657 --> 1:09:47.183
- Don't you dare laugh!

1:09:47.226 --> 1:09:48.271
- Show him the scars.

1:09:51.274 --> 1:09:52.188
- Scars?

1:09:54.059 --> 1:09:57.018
- The scars on your stomach
from cutting yourself.

1:10:06.114 --> 1:10:07.420
- How do you know about that?

1:10:09.379 --> 1:10:10.815
- I just know, Grace.

1:10:12.512 --> 1:10:13.296
Show him.

1:10:23.088 --> 1:10:27.048
- It was the only way that
I could deal with the pain,

1:10:27.092 --> 1:10:30.008
and feel like I was still alive.

1:10:30.051 --> 1:10:32.140
- I raised you with
discipline so you'd grow up

1:10:32.184 --> 1:10:34.882
to be strong, it's not
my fault you're weak.

1:10:34.926 --> 1:10:37.102
- It's not your
fault she's weak?

1:10:39.322 --> 1:10:44.457
You used your daughters
for your own sick pleasure,

1:10:45.284 --> 1:10:49.027
you sick son of a bitch.

1:10:51.421 --> 1:10:53.336
- Do you even care?

1:10:56.339 --> 1:11:00.299
About how hard my life has
been after I left here?

1:11:04.695 --> 1:11:07.045
- Do you wanna hear
about a hard life?

1:11:08.351 --> 1:11:13.094
How about your wife
dying, leaving you alone

1:11:14.966 --> 1:11:18.099
with an unbearable loneliness.

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:20.885
- She was our mother.

1:11:24.105 --> 1:11:26.282
She left us all alone.

1:11:28.893 --> 1:11:33.332
And we had to stay here
alone with you, you monster.

1:11:34.812 --> 1:11:39.207
- I had to cater to the
sexual whims of men,

1:11:41.384 --> 1:11:42.385
just to survive,

1:11:43.995 --> 1:11:46.476
because it was the only way
that I could make enough money

1:11:46.519 --> 1:11:51.307
to pay for the psychiatrists
and the hospitalizations.

1:11:53.047 --> 1:11:55.006
I have needed a lot of help

1:11:57.269 --> 1:12:00.403
to deal with everything
that you put me through.

1:12:00.446 --> 1:12:01.491
- You see?

1:12:04.581 --> 1:12:05.799
Weak.

1:12:06.670 --> 1:12:08.324
Weak.

1:12:10.326 --> 1:12:14.373
- Nothing has been as
satisfying as this.

1:12:21.511 --> 1:12:23.469
- Tell him about
the medical bills.

1:12:25.732 --> 1:12:26.603
From your problem.

1:12:27.778 --> 1:12:29.432
- I don't wanna talk about that.

1:12:34.524 --> 1:12:37.396
- You could really use the
stash of money he stole.

1:12:39.093 --> 1:12:40.007
- Is it true?

1:12:42.445 --> 1:12:44.142
About the money?

1:12:44.185 --> 1:12:45.752
- You wanna know
about the money?

1:12:47.101 --> 1:12:50.670
About the money, where I hid it?

1:12:53.499 --> 1:12:54.544
It's with your mother.

1:12:57.503 --> 1:13:01.377
In a small wooden box,
buried in her grave.

1:13:03.161 --> 1:13:04.118
Yeah, I took it.

1:13:05.076 --> 1:13:06.599
I took it.

1:13:06.643 --> 1:13:11.125
To help her, so I could get
her out of that toxic factory.

1:13:13.084 --> 1:13:16.957
But she got sick anyway,
so I took more and more,

1:13:18.437 --> 1:13:22.136
to pay for her treatments,
but nothing worked.

1:13:27.881 --> 1:13:32.320
And you wanna know how much
is left, after all that?

1:13:33.191 --> 1:13:33.974
One dollar.

1:13:35.498 --> 1:13:39.284
One measly little
dollar, buried with her.

1:13:39.327 --> 1:13:42.896
So you can go ahead and
take that worthless,

1:13:42.940 --> 1:13:47.510
pathetic little dollar, you
ungrateful little whore!

1:13:48.554 --> 1:13:49.555
- He raped you.

1:13:51.078 --> 1:13:53.385
You need to face the facts.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:54.778
- No.

1:13:54.821 --> 1:13:55.822
No, he didn't.

1:13:55.866 --> 1:13:57.955
It never went that far, it was,

1:13:57.998 --> 1:13:59.826
it was just touching.

1:13:59.870 --> 1:14:01.132
It was...

1:14:01.175 --> 1:14:03.090
- Then why can't
you have children?

1:14:05.658 --> 1:14:07.181
- It's just a

1:14:07.225 --> 1:14:08.531
medical condition that I have!
- Snap out of it, Grace!

1:14:10.968 --> 1:14:14.232
- It's just a medical
condition that I have.

1:14:17.627 --> 1:14:21.326
- You going to tell her
about the baby, or should I?

1:14:25.548 --> 1:14:26.592
- Serena.

1:14:26.636 --> 1:14:28.289
Hey, Serena!

1:14:29.682 --> 1:14:31.292
I did you a favor.

1:14:31.336 --> 1:14:32.946
I saved you from having
to raise a little brat

1:14:32.990 --> 1:14:34.600
at such a young age.

1:14:34.644 --> 1:14:37.429
- This is madness, I can't
believe what I'm hearing.

1:14:48.135 --> 1:14:50.660
- He raped me, it was his baby!

1:15:01.453 --> 1:15:02.498
- I'm so sorry.

1:15:28.393 --> 1:15:30.395
- He got rid of the problem.

1:15:32.745 --> 1:15:34.486
He killed the baby.

1:17:09.755 --> 1:17:10.930
- Just a minute!

1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:18.982
Hello?
- Good morning there, Miss.

1:17:19.025 --> 1:17:21.158
I'm Sheriff Waters,
you mind if I come in?

1:17:22.986 --> 1:17:25.031
- It's kind of a mess in here.

1:17:25.075 --> 1:17:27.817
- I just need to ask you a
couple questions, that's all.

1:17:33.692 --> 1:17:35.172
- How can I help you, Sheriff?

1:17:35.215 --> 1:17:36.564
- My condolences, Grace.

1:17:37.740 --> 1:17:39.089
I was aware of your
father's passing,

1:17:39.132 --> 1:17:41.395
and I sent the coroner out here.

1:17:41.439 --> 1:17:44.703
My son, he helped
arranged to bury him here,

1:17:44.747 --> 1:17:46.487
next to your mom.

1:17:46.531 --> 1:17:47.793
- Thank you, Sheriff Waters.

1:17:47.837 --> 1:17:49.752
- Well, like I
said, it was my son.

1:17:51.362 --> 1:17:54.452
I believe he wrote you about
taking care of your estate.

1:17:54.495 --> 1:17:57.803
- I told him that I haven't
made any decision yet.

1:17:57.847 --> 1:17:58.761
- When was that?

1:17:59.849 --> 1:18:00.850
- A few days ago.

1:18:02.852 --> 1:18:04.505
- A little off-topic here,

1:18:06.464 --> 1:18:10.511
you didn't happen to
see a small wooden box

1:18:10.555 --> 1:18:11.817
around here, did you?

1:18:12.949 --> 1:18:15.342
I looked around here
after your father passed,

1:18:15.386 --> 1:18:18.389
and I didn't see it at all.

1:18:18.432 --> 1:18:20.304
It's official police business.

1:18:21.566 --> 1:18:23.002
- I'm sorry, I haven't
seen any kind of a box

1:18:23.046 --> 1:18:24.656
like that around here.

1:18:25.744 --> 1:18:27.790
If you'll excuse me, I
really need to get back

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:29.748
to sorting through--
- Alright, alright.

1:18:29.792 --> 1:18:31.010
Thank you for your time.

1:18:31.054 --> 1:18:33.752
But if you happen
to see that box,

1:18:33.796 --> 1:18:35.058
you will let me know, right?

1:18:35.101 --> 1:18:35.885
- Will do.

1:18:37.103 --> 1:18:38.626
- Good to see you, Grace.

1:18:38.670 --> 1:18:39.453
- You too.

1:18:46.678 --> 1:18:47.461
Serena.

1:18:49.637 --> 1:18:51.509
- He's going to come back.

1:18:51.552 --> 1:18:52.815
- What do we do?

1:18:52.858 --> 1:18:53.946
- We need to finish
what we started now.

1:18:53.990 --> 1:18:56.862
- Yes, let's finish
it and move on.

1:19:03.826 --> 1:19:05.653
- Are you not happy yet?

1:19:05.697 --> 1:19:07.873
- I don't think I can ever
make you suffer enough

1:19:07.917 --> 1:19:09.092
for what you've done.

1:19:09.135 --> 1:19:11.181
- Just send me back already.

1:19:16.664 --> 1:19:17.448
- I can't.

1:19:18.928 --> 1:19:23.410
Not until you grasp the
gravity of what you've done.

1:19:23.454 --> 1:19:27.414
- You don't seem to grasp
the level of pain I was in,

1:19:27.458 --> 1:19:28.720
and what was done to me.

1:19:30.330 --> 1:19:32.071
There is so much you don't know.

1:19:32.115 --> 1:19:34.204
You know, you never
met your grandfather,

1:19:35.727 --> 1:19:37.860
because he shot himself in
the head before you were born.

1:19:37.903 --> 1:19:39.383
But if you had, you'd know,

1:19:39.426 --> 1:19:43.039
however bad you think I
was, he was far worse.

1:19:43.082 --> 1:19:44.605
He was a cocksucker.

1:19:44.649 --> 1:19:48.218
- Are you gonna try to
justify what you did

1:19:48.261 --> 1:19:49.959
with your sob story?

1:19:51.874 --> 1:19:54.833
- After hearing what you did
to Serena and an innocent baby,

1:19:56.139 --> 1:19:59.142
do you really think there's
anything you can say to me

1:19:59.185 --> 1:20:02.232
to make me have an ounce
of sympathy for you?

1:20:15.375 --> 1:20:18.639
- Am I going to tell her
what happened, or are you?

1:20:23.253 --> 1:20:25.298
- No, don't, Serena.

1:20:25.342 --> 1:20:26.822
Please.

1:20:26.865 --> 1:20:30.826
Why tell her, just let her
believe the way things are.

1:20:32.523 --> 1:20:34.177
- Are you growing
soft on me now?

1:20:35.874 --> 1:20:38.964
Or are you just too
chickenshit to tell her?

1:20:39.008 --> 1:20:39.965
- Tell me what?

1:20:40.009 --> 1:20:41.706
- Serena, don't!
- Shut up!

1:20:43.186 --> 1:20:44.840
Shut up!

1:20:44.883 --> 1:20:46.058
It's time.

1:20:46.102 --> 1:20:48.278
- Please, just release
my soul, please.

1:20:48.321 --> 1:20:50.497
I can't be here for this.

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:51.281
I can't.

1:20:53.979 --> 1:20:55.981
- No, you coward.

1:20:56.025 --> 1:20:59.898
You're gonna face
the consequences of
your biggest sin.

1:20:59.942 --> 1:21:01.682
-  Your
baby, your secret!

1:21:03.380 --> 1:21:04.947
- I had two secrets.

1:21:07.079 --> 1:21:08.254
I only told you one.

1:21:11.736 --> 1:21:13.085
- Tell me.

1:21:13.129 --> 1:21:15.783
- There's nothing more
you can do to me, please.

1:21:16.872 --> 1:21:18.395
Please just release me.

1:21:18.438 --> 1:21:19.352
- Tell her!

1:21:39.982 --> 1:21:41.548
- She already knows.

1:21:42.506 --> 1:21:44.116
- She's always known.

1:21:48.164 --> 1:21:51.471
- She just hasn't
been able to face it.

1:22:30.119 --> 1:22:33.078
- But you're here with me.

1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:43.697
- I've always been with you.

1:22:45.830 --> 1:22:47.658
I never left your side.

1:23:12.813 --> 1:23:14.380
- How could that be?

1:23:19.516 --> 1:23:20.996
Are you real?

1:23:23.085 --> 1:23:24.956
- I'm real to you in your heart.

1:23:26.740 --> 1:23:28.220
You carry me with you.

1:23:29.874 --> 1:23:31.571
- I don't understand.

1:23:39.492 --> 1:23:41.625
He told me you were gone.

1:23:43.409 --> 1:23:45.846
I looked everywhere for you.

1:23:47.152 --> 1:23:49.198
You just vanished.

1:23:50.721 --> 1:23:54.768
When drawn is the
magical circle.

1:23:58.816 --> 1:24:01.384
By sword or athame or power.

1:24:07.259 --> 1:24:10.262
His compass between
the two worlds lies.

1:24:15.485 --> 1:24:19.184
Serena, I'm sorry for the things

1:24:19.228 --> 1:24:21.621
that Father made me do to you.

1:24:51.173 --> 1:24:52.261
Serena.

1:25:01.748 --> 1:25:04.099
I don't even know what's real.

1:25:06.449 --> 1:25:07.928
What are you?

1:25:07.972 --> 1:25:10.670
- I'm whatever
you want me to be.

1:25:14.544 --> 1:25:17.286
- You won't leave me, will you?

1:25:25.207 --> 1:25:27.165
- We can be together forever.

1:25:29.341 --> 1:25:30.560
-  How?

1:25:33.258 --> 1:25:36.435
-  If you eat
all the mushrooms.

1:25:40.352 --> 1:25:41.440
- Serena?

1:25:44.226 --> 1:25:45.052
Serena!

1:25:47.229 --> 1:25:48.273
Don't leave me!

1:26:14.995 --> 1:26:17.346
You killed her!

1:26:18.738 --> 1:26:22.525
You raped her and
you killed her baby!

1:26:22.568 --> 1:26:24.570
You killed her!

1:26:24.614 --> 1:26:26.616
You killed her!

1:27:09.311 --> 1:27:11.400
I cast out your
soul forevermore.

1:27:11.443 --> 1:27:13.140
Not to calm and peace.

1:27:13.184 --> 1:27:16.361
I cast it into the shadows,
you shall never know peace.

1:27:16.405 --> 1:27:19.321
You shall grow low in the
shadows, knowing only dark.

1:27:19.364 --> 1:27:22.933
Hate and sadness forevermore
will permeate your heart.

1:27:22.976 --> 1:27:26.284
Hate and sadness forevermore
will permeate your heart.

1:27:26.328 --> 1:27:28.330
Hate and sadness forevermore
will permeate your heart.

1:28:02.625 --> 1:28:03.408
- Grace.

1:28:11.373 --> 1:28:12.548
What happened?

1:28:27.563 --> 1:28:29.042
- I'll get you some water.

1:28:34.439 --> 1:28:35.701
- Where are my clothes?

1:29:16.438 --> 1:29:17.569
- Whoa, what the...

1:29:20.442 --> 1:29:22.008
Damn it, not again.

1:29:22.879 --> 1:29:24.446
- Is this where my mommy is?

1:29:24.489 --> 1:29:25.403
I miss my mommy.

1:29:25.447 --> 1:29:30.365
- Hey, hey, hush now, okay?

1:29:30.408 --> 1:29:32.715
Don't worry, I'll
take care of you.

1:29:32.758 --> 1:29:34.238
- I wanna go home.

1:29:34.281 --> 1:29:36.458
You said you were gonna
take me to my mom.

1:29:36.501 --> 1:29:38.503
- Why don't you just
stay in the car?

1:29:38.547 --> 1:29:39.896
I'm sure I can fix this.

1:30:06.313 --> 1:30:08.881
- We're not gonna let him get
away with that, now are we?

1:30:08.925 --> 1:30:11.406
- No, we most certainly are not.

1:30:13.495 --> 1:30:14.321
- Okay.

1:30:15.497 --> 1:30:16.323
Yeah.

1:30:17.803 --> 1:30:22.547
Now look, you've been a
very good little boy so far.

1:30:23.156 --> 1:30:24.419
Alright?

1:30:24.462 --> 1:30:28.466
Now, if you keep being
a very good little boy,

1:30:29.554 --> 1:30:31.295
maybe you'll get a treat.

1:30:31.338 --> 1:30:32.209
- Ice cream?

1:30:32.252 --> 1:30:34.037
- We can get some ice cream,

1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:37.301
or maybe a sucker.

1:30:38.607 --> 1:30:39.390
A sucker?

1:30:41.523 --> 1:30:45.657
But it's very important that
you do everything I say.

1:30:45.701 --> 1:30:48.834
Everything, and then
you'll get your treat.

1:30:51.097 --> 1:30:53.622
- I can get a treat?

1:30:53.665 --> 1:30:56.494
- Oh, you'll get
a treat, alright.

1:30:56.538 --> 1:30:57.364
Oh yeah.

1:30:59.628 --> 1:31:01.456
- Together.
- Forever.
