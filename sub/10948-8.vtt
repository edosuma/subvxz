Well, actually, what I'm trying to say is

02:40.290 --> 02:42.040
some of us might fetch water

02:42.120 --> 02:44.210
while someone else
might set up the fire pit

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
Uh!

13:17.300 --> 13:18.510
Ohh.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.220
That really hurt my tailbone.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.020
Wads of wet fur.

13:29.390 --> 13:30.560
How delightful.

13:30.940 --> 13:35.860
Hmm, they're not wads.
They're more like bundles.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.820
Or bunches?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.900
It's got an "uh" sound.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.490
Clumps.

13:42.570 --> 13:45.030
Clumps! They're clumps!

13:49.960 --> 13:51.500
The trail goes this way.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.710
The Avatar is trying
to give us the slip.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.970
You two head in that direction
and keep your eye out for the bison.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.350
I'll follow this trail.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.700
Toph couldn't have
made it too far.

15:08.780 --> 15:09.870
( SCREECHES )

15:09.950 --> 15:11.540
What is it, Momo?! Oh, no!

15:12.040 --> 15:13.460
Katara!

15:13.540 --> 15:15.250
How did they find us?

15:16.750 --> 15:19.000
SOKKA: Appa, come on.
We need to go faster.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.710
KATARA: He's too tired.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.260
Not good, not good!

15:24.930 --> 15:26.970
We just need to make it
across that river.

15:28.140 --> 15:29.970
Come on, Appa! Just a little further.

15:35.940 --> 15:36.940
Whoa!

15:43.440 --> 15:45.070
SOKKA: We made it. We're safe.

15:45.150 --> 15:46.660
KATARA: You did it, Appa!

16:28.820 --> 16:30.160
Good try, but no.

16:38.420 --> 16:39.420
How you doing?

16:39.500 --> 16:40.670
Well, you know.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.670
I thought when Ty Lee and I finally
caught you guys,

16:43.750 --> 16:45.590
it would be more exciting.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.130
Oh, well, victory is boring.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.340
- Aah!
- Aah!

16:53.390 --> 16:55.890
Thanks, Appa.
I don't know what we'd do without you.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.860
Was it just me,
or was that guy kind of cute?

17:20.170 --> 17:21.960
All right. You've caught up with me.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.880
Now, who are you,
and what do you want?

17:24.550 --> 17:28.340
You mean, you haven't guessed?
You don't see the family resemblance.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.800
Here's a hint.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.720
( IMITATING ZUKO )
I must find the Avatar

17:31.800 --> 17:33.180
to restore my honor.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.180
( REGULAR VOICE ) It's ok. You can laugh.

17:36.350 --> 17:37.350
It's funny.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.390
So what now?

17:39.480 --> 17:43.980
Now? Now it's over.
You're tired, and you have no place to go.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.020
You can run, but I'll catch you.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.650
I'm not running.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.120
Here is your tea.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.710
You seem a little
too young to be traveling alone.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.340
You seem a little too old.

18:09.090 --> 18:10.550
Ha ha ha!

18:10.630 --> 18:12.260
Perhaps I am.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.760
I know what you're thinking,

18:14.850 --> 18:17.310
I look like I can't handle
being by myself.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.390
I wasn't thinking that.

18:19.850 --> 18:22.520
You wouldn't let me pour
my own cup of tea.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.570
I poured your tea
because I wanted to

18:26.650 --> 18:28.570
and for no other reason.

18:29.070 --> 18:31.190
People see me
and think I'm weak.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.900
They want to take care of me,

18:32.990 --> 18:36.160
but I can take care of myself by myself.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.330
You sound like my nephew,

18:38.790 --> 18:42.290
Always thinking
you need to do things on your own

18:42.370 --> 18:44.790
without anyone's support.

18:45.040 --> 18:49.630
There is nothing wrong
with letting people who love you help you.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.840
Not that I love you.
Well, I just met you.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.430
( CHUCKLES )

18:54.680 --> 18:57.010
So where is your nephew?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.510
I've been tracking him, actually.

18:59.850 --> 19:01.100
Is he lost?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.850
Yes, a little bit.

19:04.350 --> 19:07.110
His life has recently changed,

19:07.190 --> 19:10.280
And he's going through
very difficult times.

19:10.780 --> 19:14.110
He's trying to figure out who he is,

19:14.200 --> 19:15.700
and he went away.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.990
So now you're following him.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.620
I know he doesn't
want me around right now,

19:21.700 --> 19:24.830
but if he needs me, I'll be there.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.380
Your nephew is very lucky,

19:27.460 --> 19:28.750
even if he doesn't know it.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.550
Thank you.

19:31.630 --> 19:35.840
My pleasure. Sharing tea
with a fascinating stranger

19:35.930 --> 19:39.010
is one of life's true delights.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.310
No. Thank you for what you said.

19:41.970 --> 19:44.730
- It helped me.
- I'm glad.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.610
Oh, and about your nephew,

19:48.690 --> 19:51.110
maybe you should tell him
that you need him, too.

19:55.650 --> 19:57.110
( LIZARD HISSING )

19:59.320 --> 20:01.280
Do you really want to fight me?

20:02.950 --> 20:05.620
Yes. I really do.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Zuko!

20:07.080 --> 20:09.130
I was wondering
when you'd show up, Zu-Zu.

20:09.630 --> 20:11.460
Ha ha. Zu-zu?

20:11.880 --> 20:14.510
Back off, Azula. He's mine.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.970
I'm not going anywhere.

21:06.770 --> 21:08.520
( YELLS )

21:19.990 --> 21:21.660
Whoa! Aah!

21:42.970 --> 21:44.600
Aah!

21:58.780 --> 21:59.900
Katara!

22:10.910 --> 22:12.170
Uncle.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.670
Get up.

22:24.300 --> 22:26.350
I thought you guys
could use a little help.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.810
Thanks.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.690
Well, look at this.

22:38.780 --> 22:41.860
Enemies and traitors all working together.

22:42.740 --> 22:45.200
I'm done.
I know when I'm beaten.

22:45.530 --> 22:49.240
You got me.
A princess surrenders with honor.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.710
Aah!

22:58.670 --> 22:59.670
( YELLS )

23:15.900 --> 23:17.190
Get away from us!

23:22.570 --> 23:23.990
Zuko, I can help.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.320
Leave!
