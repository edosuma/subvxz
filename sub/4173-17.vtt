00:02.276 --> 00:03.910
So this rock climbing wall
will be big!

00:03.912 --> 00:06.579
And best of all,
it'll be built
out of all natural,

00:06.581 --> 00:09.849
100% organic,
free-range
yard trimmings.

00:09.851 --> 00:12.418
So it is only
a rock climbing wall?

00:12.420 --> 00:14.587
No, it's not "only"
a rock climbing wall.

00:14.589 --> 00:17.256
It's a free-range,
organic rock climbing wall.

00:17.258 --> 00:18.558
I can see how
that would be relevant

00:18.560 --> 00:19.558
if we were
going to eat it.

00:20.024 --> 00:21.494
We're not going to
have to eat it, are we?

00:21.496 --> 00:22.962
I guess if we had to,
we could. But...

00:22.964 --> 00:25.364
Did I just hear
we're building
something we can eat?

00:25.366 --> 00:28.301
You know, for the record,
I would like to not to be
in a position today

00:28.303 --> 00:29.301
where I have to
eat this wall.

00:29.024 --> 00:32.305
We'll see what we can do,
but we're not making
any promises.

00:32.307 --> 00:35.641
Mom, have you seen
my other white skirt?
What are those charts?

00:35.643 --> 00:39.479
Hon, the rare and elusive
Bentbill Nuthatch is in its
nest building season.

00:39.481 --> 00:40.913
The birds will be done
traveling north

00:40.915 --> 00:43.516
and should be right
here in town today.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.024
Snoresville.

00:44.518 --> 00:48.521
No, dear, the bird took
a left at Snoresville
and is up here in Danville.

00:48.523 --> 00:50.456
Can I get one up high?
Whoo-hoo!

00:50.458 --> 00:51.724
Okay, more specifically,

00:51.726 --> 00:53.860
it should be right
in our backyard

00:53.862 --> 00:56.696
at exactly 4:00 today!
Isn't it exciting?

00:56.698 --> 00:57.797
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:57.799 --> 00:59.966
So you and a bunch
of trained observers

00:59.968 --> 01:02.902
are gonna be
in our yard at exactly
4:00 in the PM today?

01:02.904 --> 01:04.270
Well, yes.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.372
Love it!

01:06.374 --> 01:08.441
The booby-hatch trash nut,
whatever it is,
is my new favorite bird!

01:08.443 --> 01:10.576
This is awesome!
See you guys later.

01:10.578 --> 01:12.612
See?
She thinks it's fun.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.380
Oh, yes.
And I'm British

01:14.382 --> 01:16.048
so you think
I'm supposed to like
bird watching.

01:16.050 --> 01:17.984
"Ooh, I'm British,
so I'll be in the
conservatory

01:17.986 --> 01:18.984
"with a cup of tea
and a crumpet."

01:19.024 --> 01:22.288
I'm saying that ironically,
but actually,
that sounds quite good.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.657
So I'm going to do that. Ta.

01:24.659 --> 01:26.626
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
This looks good.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.529
So, how long
till you're done with
this contraption?

01:29.531 --> 01:30.797
Think you'll still be
out here at four?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.398
I dunno.
I guess so.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.699
ISABELLA: Hi, Phineas.

01:33.701 --> 01:35.001
What you doing?

01:35.003 --> 01:37.637
Hey, Isabella.
Rock climbing wall.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.838
Well, I just came by
to tell you

01:38.840 --> 01:39.838
I can't join in
on the fun today.

01:40.024 --> 01:42.475
I've been charged with
the task of recording
	the audio book version

01:42.477 --> 01:44.510
of the <i>Fireside Girls</i>
<i>Compendium Guide.</i>

01:44.512 --> 01:45.678
It's gonna take forever!

01:45.680 --> 01:47.647
That book does not look
so intimidating.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.515
Dude, this is just
the table of contents!

01:49.517 --> 01:51.884
The actual book
is being transported
from a secret bunker

01:51.886 --> 01:54.453
to our recording studio
in the Fireside Girl lodge.

01:58.458 --> 02:00.560
Seriously, this is going
to take me a week.

02:00.562 --> 02:01.560
Hey, we can help.

02:02.024 --> 02:03.429
We'll just put this
rock climbing wall
off till tomorrow.

02:03.431 --> 02:05.464
Wait, what? No!

02:05.466 --> 02:07.600
You guys keep working!
I'll narrate the audio book!

02:07.602 --> 02:09.402
You stay here
and help the boys.

02:09.404 --> 02:11.370
And not only will I finish
recording your book today,

02:11.372 --> 02:12.638
I'll do it by 4:00!

02:12.640 --> 02:14.607
So, let me
get this straight.

02:14.609 --> 02:17.343
You'll do all the work
while I spend the day
with Phineas?

02:17.345 --> 02:18.611
Hmm... Deal.

02:18.613 --> 02:19.712
But do you know anyone
that can work

02:19.714 --> 02:21.347
a state-of-the-art
sound board?

02:21.349 --> 02:22.347
Someone who can edit
huge digital files?

02:22.524 --> 02:24.750
Someone who can understand
basic miking techniques?

02:24.752 --> 02:26.986
(SQUEALS)

02:26.988 --> 02:28.387
What is it, Irving?

02:28.389 --> 02:29.889
Okay, I'll do it.

02:29.891 --> 02:31.657
But only if
Isabella says,
"Where's Perry?"

02:31.659 --> 02:33.659
No deal.
You drive a hard bargain.
I'm in.

02:33.661 --> 02:35.428
It's okay, I was about
to ask that anyway.

02:39.433 --> 02:40.024
MONOGRAM: <i>Ah! Agent P,</i>

And when I say "isn't,"
I mean "is."

04:44.559 --> 04:46.158
I know you're
into martial arts,

04:46.160 --> 04:49.161
but I prefer
the confectionery

04:49.163 --> 04:50.730

04:57.705 --> 04:58.703

Oh, yeah.

04:59.024 --> 05:01.173
I think I know why
I'm having a hard time

05:01.175 --> 05:03.642
taking over the
Tri-State Area.

05:03.644 --> 05:06.579
It's because
of dinner parties.
That's right.

05:06.581 --> 05:07.980
Follow me,
it, it goes somewhere.

05:07.982 --> 05:09.982
You see, my brother,
Roger, is a success

05:09.984 --> 05:11.617
because of his amazing
dinner parties,

05:11.619 --> 05:13.652
where he dazzles
important guests

05:13.654 --> 05:15.588
with his
magnetic charm.

05:15.590 --> 05:18.224
But what if he were
unable to charm anyone

05:18.226 --> 05:20.192
because his fabulous
dinner parties

05:20.194 --> 05:22.995
were over
before they began?

05:22.997 --> 05:25.631
That's why I created this!

05:25.633 --> 05:28.901
The Bring-Out-
the-Dessert-inator!

05:28.903 --> 05:31.203
You see,
everyone knows that
once the dessert comes out

05:31.205 --> 05:33.239
the party's over.
That's what's,

05:33.241 --> 05:35.307
that's what's called
a social cue.

05:35.309 --> 05:38.778
This rocket will go into
a Roger-centric orbit
around his house.

05:38.780 --> 05:40.980
At the wrong moment,
it will shoot a blast

05:40.982 --> 05:43.582
which will make Roger
bring out the dessert,

05:43.584 --> 05:46.185
ending his dinner party
before it can begin.

05:46.187 --> 05:47.720
He'll lose his
charming edge

05:47.722 --> 05:49.688
and people will lose
interest in him.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.590
Bing, bang, boom,
they'll stop voting for him.

05:51.592 --> 05:54.627
And that's when
I'll slink in and take ov...

05:54.629 --> 05:56.929
You know, I, I know
I'm grasping at straws here,

05:56.931 --> 05:59.698
and I'll probably end up
grasping at bendy straws

05:59.700 --> 06:02.068
and fall on my face
requiring months of rehab

06:02.070 --> 06:04.703
to learn
how to monologue
all over again.

06:04.705 --> 06:06.739
And then it's off
to empowerment camp,

06:06.741 --> 06:08.574
where I'll have to
fall backwards
and hope that someone...

06:08.576 --> 06:10.676
Who wants dessert?

06:11.645 --> 06:13.646
I made this
lovely tiramisu.

06:13.648 --> 06:16.715
Hey! It works!

06:16.717 --> 06:18.751
Oh, you think
you're very funny,
Perry the Platypus,

06:18.753 --> 06:21.720
blasting me with my own
Bring-Out-the-Dessert-inator.

06:21.722 --> 06:22.720
What?

06:23.024 --> 06:25.658
Oh, ho, ho, I hope
you left some room!

06:25.660 --> 06:28.127
I made a yummy
double layer
pumpkin cheesecake.

06:28.129 --> 06:29.595
It has creamy...

06:29.597 --> 06:30.595
You got me again!

06:30.597 --> 06:33.933
Well, you made me
bring it to you,
so you're gonna eat it!

06:33.935 --> 06:35.134
(CRUNCHING)
Ow!

06:37.038 --> 06:40.039

Now it's your turn
to bring out the...

No!

06:43.077 --> 06:44.710

06:44.712 --> 06:47.713
How about
a banana split?
(LAUGHS)

06:47.715 --> 06:49.748
Finally got your
just desserts!

06:49.750 --> 06:51.183
Good one, right? Huh?

06:52.652 --> 06:54.286
What are you doing
with that pound cake?

06:54.288 --> 06:55.855
I was saving that
for company.

06:57.691 --> 06:59.158
Aah... (CHOKING)

07:01.328 --> 07:03.295
Oh. Oh, wow,
Perry the Platypus,

07:03.297 --> 07:06.332
I'm getting
such a sugar rush!
How about you?

07:06.334 --> 07:07.633

one more take

I can see my thoughts.

07:23.885 --> 07:26.385
They're all sparkly
and spread out around us.

07:26.387 --> 07:28.787
It is the lack of oxygen.
It makes you light-headed.

07:28.789 --> 07:30.990
I think it's time
to climb down.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.292
Ha-ha! Coming down!
Whoo-hoo!

we're in space.

Can you do this,
Perry the Platypus?

07:41.102 --> 07:43.068
Can you jump
really fast
up and down,

07:43.070 --> 07:45.337
and up and down,
and up and down,
and up and down?

07:45.339 --> 07:46.939
Yeah, that's it,
Perry the Platypus.

07:46.941 --> 07:48.941
Doesn't it feel good?
Let's be jumping buddies.

07:48.943 --> 07:50.709
Let's just eat dessert
and jump up and down,

07:50.711 --> 07:52.745
and up and down,
and up and down all day.

07:52.747 --> 07:54.079
It'll be our thing.
Just remember,

07:54.081 --> 07:56.448
I, I invented it because
I'm the inventor.

07:58.185 --> 07:59.752
Yes! It's still here.

07:59.754 --> 08:01.387
Hey, Candace!
How'd it go?

08:01.389 --> 08:03.255
I finished recording.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.357

08:07.361 --> 08:09.228
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now the important thing.

08:09.230 --> 08:10.396
To get Mom out here.

08:10.398 --> 08:13.265
(VOICE FADING) Mom! Mom!

08:13.267 --> 08:15.034
Do you want me to get Mom?

08:15.036 --> 08:17.236
(CLEARS THROAT)
No. You stay here.
Nobody move.

08:17.238 --> 08:18.971
If we leave,
this thing'll disappear.

08:18.973 --> 08:20.372
She'll be out here
in two minutes

08:20.374 --> 08:21.807

bird watching group.

I'll wait.

08:23.377 --> 08:26.178
Jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump, jump.

08:26.180 --> 08:29.081
Oh! Oh, sugar crash!

08:29.083 --> 08:30.316
(BEEPING)

08:32.152 --> 08:34.086
Oh, The-Bring-Out-
the-Dessert-inator.

08:34.088 --> 08:36.956
It must be almost time for
Roger's dinner party to begin.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.057
(CHATTERING)

08:38.059 --> 08:39.792
(LAUGHS) Sugar crash.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.294
There she goes.

08:42.296 --> 08:43.762
And you can't do
anything about it

08:43.764 --> 08:45.831
'cause you're on
a sugar crash.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.434
Wait, wait, what's that?
Protein and carbohydrates?

08:48.436 --> 08:50.803
No, don't eat that! No!

08:52.239 --> 08:56.008
Okay, but, uh, but
let's do that jumping thing
again sometime, huh?

08:57.444 --> 09:00.379
Okay, gang!
Everyone follow me outside!

09:00.381 --> 09:02.781
The bird should be right...

09:02.783 --> 09:04.750
Hey! Who's ready for dessert?

09:04.752 --> 09:06.085
Doesn't that sound good?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.921
Oh! See, now,
Brits like dessert!

09:08.923 --> 09:11.023
Does this mean
she wants us to leave?

09:11.025 --> 09:13.759
Well, according to
social convention,
I guess.

09:15.495 --> 09:16.795
DOOFENSHMIRTZ: <i>Welcome,</i>
<i>Perry the Platypus.</i>

09:16.797 --> 09:18.097
<i>What took you so long?</i>

09:18.099 --> 09:19.898
<i>I'm speaking to you</i>
<i>through this amplifier</i>

09:19.900 --> 09:21.967
<i>right next to the</i>
<i>self-destruct button.</i>

09:21.969 --> 09:24.169
<i>The rocket will</i>
<i>soon be in orbit</i>
<i>around my brother's house,</i>

09:24.171 --> 09:26.138
ready for the next
dinner party.

09:26.140 --> 09:28.374
And you can ride
that rocket until
your tail falls off.

09:28.376 --> 09:29.975
I don't care.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.210
<i>Or until you find</i>
<i>the self-destruct button,</i>

09:31.212 --> 09:33.545
<i>which is...</i>
<i>Oh, dang it!</i>

09:33.547 --> 09:37.249
Curse you,
Perry the Pla...typus.

09:38.218 --> 09:39.418
(HOARSELY) Mom!

09:39.420 --> 09:40.919
(DIALING)

09:40.921 --> 09:42.554
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Candace?

09:42.556 --> 09:45.924
Mom! Mom!
Come outside! (COUGHS)

09:45.926 --> 09:48.460
Hon, I can't hear you.
Let's talk in a minute.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.462
Who wants this
a la mode?

09:50.797 --> 09:52.097
Mom!

09:52.099 --> 09:54.366
Look! Ooh!
It's the rare
Bentbill Nuthatch!

09:54.368 --> 09:56.502
Isn't she beautiful?

09:56.504 --> 09:58.470
She's finding material
for her nest.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.805
(CHIRPING)

10:02.208 --> 10:04.576
Well, I guess
they've got a lot of
nests to make.

10:04.578 --> 10:07.546
We did build the thing
out of pressed twigs
and lawn clippings.

10:07.548 --> 10:09.581
Nature's little
recyclers at work.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.283
Come on! Come on!

10:11.285 --> 10:14.520
What? What? No!

10:14.522 --> 10:16.822
But... But... But...

10:16.824 --> 10:18.390
Oh, honey! I see it!

10:18.392 --> 10:21.327
What?
Don't move.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.462
Hold still.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
Got it!

10:23.464 --> 10:25.898
Oh, Candace,
I wouldn't have seen it

10:25.900 --> 10:28.467
if you hadn't
grabbed me forcibly
and pulled me out here.

10:28.469 --> 10:29.568
Thank you!

10:29.570 --> 10:31.270
So, you kids
want some dessert?

10:31.272 --> 10:32.271
Yeah!

10:35.909 --> 10:37.943
Some tea with honey
would help that throat.

10:37.945 --> 10:40.946
And there's crumpets
in the conservatory as well.

10:40.948 --> 10:42.548
He's so British.

10:46.119 --> 10:47.553
Let's go!

10:51.891 --> 10:53.459
