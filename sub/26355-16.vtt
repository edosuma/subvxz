WEBVTT

00:07.590 --> 00:09.800
It's pretty cool
we got our own mural, huh?

00:09.801 --> 00:10.968
Eh, don't get too excited.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.386
You know who else has one?

00:12.387 --> 00:15.264
- The Ox-Bow Incident.
- What is that?

00:15.265 --> 00:18.976
Set in Bridger's Wells, Nevada
in 1885,

00:18.977 --> 00:23.188
The Ox-Bow Incident is a tale
of cowboys, cattle and conflict.

00:23.189 --> 00:26.024
If you guys could just
take a seat.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.485
Okay, here we go.

00:28.486 --> 00:31.196
♪ It seems today
that all you see... ♪

00:31.197 --> 00:36.493
Okay, welcome to Family Guy
DVD commentary for episode 1614.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.829
I'm Peter Griffin,
joined by my wife Lois,

00:38.830 --> 00:40.038
our dog Brian,

00:40.039 --> 00:42.374
and our children,
Meg, Stewie and Chris.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.918
And for you kids out there,
DVDs were plastic discs...

00:44.919 --> 00:46.253
I-I got this, Brian.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.796
Have you ever been
at your grandmother's house

00:47.797 --> 00:50.340
and you look at her weird,
old computer,

00:50.341 --> 00:52.217
and there's, like,
a crack on the side of it?

00:52.218 --> 00:54.094
That's DVDs.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.346
Oh, and animation producer
Shannon Smith is here, too.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.223
- Glad to be here.
- This is actually...

00:58.224 --> 00:59.558
Oh, wait, wait. Look, look.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.059
Lot of people don't know this,

01:01.060 --> 01:03.061
but that house
is actually in Burbank.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.980
People keep stealing
their mailbox.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.107
We now return to

01:07.108 --> 01:09.276
"Winona Ryder Distracting from
Other Speeches in History."

01:09.277 --> 01:11.278
Four score
and seven years ago...

01:11.279 --> 01:13.155
Wow, yeah, yeah,
I remember this.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.866
Winona Ryder kind of hung out
on set all day,

01:15.867 --> 01:18.243
and it, uh, wore a little thin
on all of us.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.661
Yeah, I actually had to

01:19.662 --> 01:21.246
close a door on her
at one point.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.664
I-I just remember she stole

01:22.665 --> 01:24.625
a ton of LUNA Bars
from the office kitchen.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.084
Like-like, filled
a whole duffel bag.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.586
Great news, everyone.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.630
The new smartphone
from Crabapple is out.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.632
The new Crabapple phone?
Awesome.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.634
Yeah, the network
doesn't like us using

01:33.635 --> 01:35.469
the names of actual companies
on the show.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.929
It's not so bad, though.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.432
We can still say Burger Kong,
McDarrel's, Kooka Cola,

01:40.433 --> 01:43.268
Pipsi, Chevrolump
and all the big ones.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.646
I want to be the first
to get the new phone.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.564
I don't care
if it takes all day.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.774
Don't you have work?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.150
Eh, I wouldn't mind
missing work.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.110
There's a secretary
looking for reassurance

01:52.111 --> 01:54.072
about her overly short haircu.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.074
I saw it in a magazine.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.659
I needed a fresh start.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.619
Stop pretending to stare
at your phones,

02:00.620 --> 02:02.371
and just say you hate it.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.457
Sir, I am trying to read.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.335
Ah, the writer credits
have begun.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.044
I'm gonna give personal facts

02:10.045 --> 02:12.047
about each of the names
that pops up.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.465
Mom, will you tie my shoes?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.968
Smokes on
the no-smoking balcony.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.220
Weird church guy.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.390
Instagrams cowboy hats
at 3:00 a.m.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.809
Pushed his wife at a party.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.185
Oh, my God, Cherry's the best.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.145
We love her.
Hi, Cherry. We love you.

02:27.146 --> 02:29.565
Kids, time to gather up
our old cords and chargers

02:29.566 --> 02:31.692
that no longer work
and throw them in the garbage.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.026
We can't do that.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.820
Don't you know a lot
of discarded electronics

02:34.821 --> 02:36.864
end up in the ocean
and kill sea turtles?

02:36.865 --> 02:38.699
Well, then let's cut out
the middleman.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.034
I'm sorry.
There's a new phone.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.787
That was cool.
I got to go to Fiji for that.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.831
They got a ton of turtles there.

02:45.832 --> 02:46.999
You can kill 'em, nobody cares.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.543
Oh my gosh. I just got it.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.961
Crab-apple.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.964
Take a lap, Meg.
Think about what you said.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.716
Hey. Gold phone is mine.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.301
Already match fingernail.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.928
Oh, this is where I fight
that woman for the phone.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.764
I was here first!
That's mine!

03:02.765 --> 03:04.975
You know, I actually
had a couple of ad-libs

03:04.976 --> 03:06.435
about Chinese working conditions

03:06.436 --> 03:08.270
that somehow didn't make it
into the final cut.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.689
All you said was,
"Children make iPhones."

03:10.690 --> 03:13.859
This is a comedy show,
not Mark Ruffalo's Twitter.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.694
She wanted it more than me.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.615
Take it easy, huh?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.243
Peter, I'm just not sure
it's such a great idea

03:23.244 --> 03:25.746
that everyone in the family
got a new cell phone.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.789
Is that my bottle of water?

03:27.790 --> 03:29.124
Wh-What?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.835
That open bottle--
is that yours or mine?

03:31.836 --> 03:34.129
I-I... I don't know.
Maybe yours?

03:34.130 --> 03:36.673
This is why we need
a Sharpie in here

03:36.674 --> 03:39.176
to put our names on our water!

03:39.177 --> 03:40.594
Geez, Chris. What the hell?

03:40.595 --> 03:42.429
Chris, relax. Have a Pipsi.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.972
Good morning, everybod...

03:43.973 --> 03:45.599
Damn it!

03:45.600 --> 03:48.185
She's just gonna keep it like
that for the next three years.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.227
You know, there's truth to that.

03:49.228 --> 03:51.063
You-you can tell
a lot about a person

03:51.064 --> 03:52.064
whose cell phone screen
is cracked.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.857
Like-like, if they're a girl,

03:53.858 --> 03:55.567
they definitely celebrate
their birth week.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.361
Oh, yeah. Just trash.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.029
Damn it, those phones have

03:59.030 --> 04:01.073
turned you all
into mindless drones.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.658
I knew this would happen.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.576
Getting those things
was a worse idea than...

04:04.577 --> 04:06.703
You know,
for an extra $12 a month,

04:06.704 --> 04:09.164
you can insure your screen,
and they'll replace it for free.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.874
Nice going, Meg.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.292
You talked over the setup
of this cutaway,

04:12.293 --> 04:14.127
and now we don't know
what's going on.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.462
Looks like Nicki Minaj,

04:15.463 --> 04:18.507
Iggy Azalea and Madonna
are robbing a bank.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.132
Um... they're butt bandits?

04:20.134 --> 04:22.844
"Ocean's 36-24-49?"

04:22.845 --> 04:25.097
Oh, I remember.
They're all skanks.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.975
"Getting new phones was a worse
idea than a skank robbery."

04:27.976 --> 04:29.977
- Oh, yeah.
- Right, skank robbery.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.980
I'm sorry, that's not funny.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.774
Today's sermon
is about perseverance.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.902
When I was run out of Boston
by the Spotlight team,

04:38.903 --> 04:40.988
I could've hung up my collar.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.280
Oh, my God. Again?

04:42.281 --> 04:44.616
You guys have got
to put those away.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.660
You can't be
on your phones in here.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.329
Relax, Lois.
It's just stupid, boring
church.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.081
Not like we're gonna
miss anything.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.001
But instead, I packed my Bibles
and my Tootsie Pops

04:54.002 --> 04:56.086
and headed down to Quahog.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.923
With a renewed sense of spirit
and a renewed reverence for...

04:59.924 --> 05:02.676
Jesus Christ?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.845
Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.638
Danny the intern is here
with your paychecks.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.390
Oh, thanks, Danny.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.058
Hey, Chris,
here's your paycheck.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.853
Yeah, that gets forwarded
right to DraftKings.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.062
What's going on in there,
Ollie?

05:14.063 --> 05:15.063
- He came back!
- How is he?

05:15.064 --> 05:17.065
- Mad!
- Thanks, Ollie.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.233
H-Hold on, Danny, it looks like

05:18.234 --> 05:20.068
you accidentally
gave me Peter's check.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.029
Wait. What the hell?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.906
This number is four times
what I make.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.992
- Peter, you always said
you made the same as me.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.869
I'm sorry, Lois.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.829
I couldn't hear you
over Meg's Snickers wrapper.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.706
- What's this, now?
- I can't believe this, Peter.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.624
Y-You lied to me.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.793
Let's get out of here,
other altar boys.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.086
This is bull crap.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.006
I'm calling Fox
or Disney payroll right now.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.384
Fox or Disney payroll.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.386
- Yeah, hi. This is Lois Griff...
- Please hold.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.431
Of course.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.475
Yeah, Mom, that's not fair.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.685
Meg is right. That's not fair.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.854
Thank you for
continuing to hold.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.814
...turn my family
into brain-dead robots.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.232
In fact, you know what?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.943
We're finally going
to Old Sturbridge Village.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.196
Thank you for
continuing to hold.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.990
...see what life was like
before all these screens.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.242
A place where people farm
their own food,

06:09.243 --> 06:11.161
make their own clothing
and read books...

06:11.162 --> 06:12.829
Thank you for
continuing to hold.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.706
Oh, come on, Lois,
you only want to go

06:14.707 --> 06:16.458
to Old Sturbridge Village
'cause you once got

06:16.459 --> 06:18.293
hand-blasted there
on a field trip.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.628
Yes, let's just say
the candles

06:19.629 --> 06:21.922
weren't the only thing
being hot-dipped.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.049
- You see, Brian?
- That's how you do an ad-lib.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.133
Went right in.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.718
Thanks for holding.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.261
How may I help you,
Mrs. Griffin?

06:28.262 --> 06:30.055
Yeah, I'll tell you how.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.723
You can explain to me
why my husband

06:31.724 --> 06:34.017
makes four times
as much money as I do.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.269
Oh, um... okay, this is awkward.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.147
But I... I, um...
I assumed you knew.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.234
Mr. Griffin was able
to negotiate a higher salary

06:42.235 --> 06:45.112
because he's still paying
alimony to his first wife.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.655
"First wife"? What?

06:46.656 --> 06:50.117
Peter, you were married before?

06:50.118 --> 06:53.036
We actually freelance
all our explosion animation.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.788
Who are you again?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.249
- I-I'm Shannon Smith.
- Shannon. Take a lap.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.960
...never go to church.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.715
How come you never told me
you were married before?

07:05.716 --> 07:07.384
- I don't know.
- Just never came up.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.386
- Never came up?!
- Well, who was she?

07:09.387 --> 07:10.720
- Sarah Paulson.
- Who?

07:10.721 --> 07:12.180
Wait, isn't she that actress

07:12.181 --> 07:13.473
who's always biting her lip?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.225
Her very full lip.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.311
I honestly have no idea
who they're talking about.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.897
Come on, Sarah Paulson's been
in a lot of stuff, Chris.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.440
Okay, pulled her up on my phone.

07:22.441 --> 07:24.025
Looks vaguely familiar.

07:24.026 --> 07:25.777
But I would legitimately suggest

07:25.778 --> 07:28.155
that people pause this right now
and Google her.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.614
Wait. Wasn't Sarah Paulson

07:29.615 --> 07:31.158
a guest star
in this exact episode?

07:31.159 --> 07:32.993
Yeah, in fact,
she was in this O.J. gag.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.203
Ah, look, Predator
just cut her head off.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.372
Not for real, though.
For real, she's actually

07:37.373 --> 07:39.875
coming into the booth right now
to be part of this commentary.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.627
- Hi, everybody.
- So sorry I'm late.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.129
I was stuck in the canyon.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.548
Is... is that a euphemism
for lesbian sex?

07:46.549 --> 07:48.633
- I don't think I've met everyone.
- I'm Sarah.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.219
I understand you and Peter
used to be married.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.637
Oh, that.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.556
Feels like ancient history.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.392
I like your shoulder blades,
Miss Paulson.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.352
They're very... jutty.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.562
Have a seat, Sarah.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.272
Shall I explain
what we're doing here?

08:02.273 --> 08:03.565
That's okay. It seems just like

08:03.566 --> 08:05.233
when I would do ADR
for American Horror Story,

08:05.234 --> 08:08.069
for which I have received
five Emmy nominations.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.779
Well, some of us have awards,

08:09.780 --> 08:11.031
some of us have children.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.490
What's that supposed to mean?

08:12.491 --> 08:13.867
Well, I don't know.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.786
You're the smart award winner.
You figure it out.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.456
Because this is a godless sho.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.707
All right, I'll do it.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.083
I'll pretend to be sick

08:22.084 --> 08:24.461
to get out of going
to Old Sturbridge Village.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.339
Mm, still 126.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.758
Oh, I wish you were feeling
well enough to come.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.843
Maybe I should stay home
and take care of you.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.094
No. Go, Lois.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.722
Go watch dead-eyed
pale women make bread.

08:35.722 --> 08:38.558
So, Lois, what will you be
wearing to the Emmys this year?

08:38.558 --> 08:41.269
I think you know
I won't be there.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.438
I won a surfboard
at the Teen Choice Awards.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.023
I left it in the kitchen
at work,

08:45.024 --> 08:46.191
hoping someone would take it.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.859
No one did.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.111
...eat a meatball sub
and watch football all day.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.072
Man, this is
an even better scam

08:52.073 --> 08:54.199
than Ferris Bueller's Day On.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.201
Okay, I need you to file these

08:56.202 --> 08:58.703
and not be working
with a shampoo mohawk.

08:58.704 --> 09:02.249
So, Sarah, I-I guess you chose
not to take Peter's name, huh?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.792
Decided to stick with "Paulson"?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.335
Yeah, his name just felt

09:05.336 --> 09:08.171
kind of, I don't know,
rough, you know?

09:08.172 --> 09:09.464
"Griffin."

09:09.465 --> 09:10.674
Right?

09:10.675 --> 09:13.093
Just sounds kind of brutish
and low-class.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.471
I also won an Emmy for
my performance as Marcia Clark

09:16.472 --> 09:18.181
in The People v. O.J. Simpson.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.183
You won an Emmy
for wearing a wig.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.977
Peter, may I speak
with you outside?

09:21.978 --> 09:25.063
Oh, boy.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.982
Uh-oh.
I think I'm stuck.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.441
Oh, right, this is where

09:28.442 --> 09:30.318
the fat man got stuck
in the banister slats.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.529
Stewie, I'm gonna give you
another crack at that,

09:32.530 --> 09:34.531
because I believe
what you meant to call them was

09:34.532 --> 09:36.157
"baluster slats,"
not "banister slats."

09:36.158 --> 09:38.243
- "Banister," "baluster."
- Same thing.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.786
Stewie,

09:39.787 --> 09:43.081
"banister" and "baluster"
are hardly the same things.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.626
A banister is the handrail that
sits atop the upright supports.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.504
A baluster is the
supporting structure itself.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.048
- Is this my water?
- No, it is not!

09:52.049 --> 09:54.509
Brian, I've heard people
say "banister slats."

09:54.510 --> 09:56.636
Well, those people, like you,
would be incorrect.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.096
So, the baluster is that

09:58.097 --> 09:59.973
big, round thing
at the bottom of the stairs

09:59.974 --> 10:02.142
- where the staircase begins?
- "Big, round thing"?

10:02.143 --> 10:04.144
You're...
you're just guessing stuff now.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.855
I believe what you're
referring to is a newel post.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.107
Mom and Dad are still
out there arguing.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.734
Shouldn't they be in here?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.277
I'll get 'em.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.112
Wasn't Shannon, like,
a P.A. here once?

10:14.113 --> 10:15.488
Shut your mouth.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.574
Shannon's the only professional
in this building.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.075
...friends were getting married.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.161
How could I
not know this?!
Hey, guys?

10:21.162 --> 10:23.413
We have to deliver this episode
to the network today.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.458
Oh, you guys are back

10:26.459 --> 10:28.626
just in time for my big role.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.295
Hey, take it down
a notch, Sarah.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.672
You don't even have an entry
on the Family Guy wiki.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.008
Even Gronk's dad has one.

10:35.009 --> 10:38.094
Welcome to Old Sturbridge
Village, everyone.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.763
Here's a fun fact.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.350
In colonial times, butter
and soap were the same thing.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.686
I get that it's a fact,
but how is it fun?

10:48.647 --> 10:50.648
Oh, my God!

10:50.649 --> 10:52.859
How the hell am I gonna
get out of this?

10:52.860 --> 10:54.569
Shh. Nobody talk
for the next minute.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.945
I'm about to sing my big song.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.572
Oh, go to hell, Peter.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.115
It's no use.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.159
I guess I'm just stuck...

11:01.160 --> 11:03.161
halfway down the stairs.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.672

11:24.183 --> 11:25.475
What the hell is this?

11:25.476 --> 11:27.185
I'll tell you what it is:

11:27.186 --> 11:29.229
an homage to a classic song
from The Muppet Show,

11:29.230 --> 11:31.231
sung by Kermit's nephew, Robin.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.982
I guarantee nobody got that.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.192
I know this song.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.992
I don't believe this.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.161
You're just singing
the same song a frog sang.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.580
How the hell was this
not cut from the show?

11:47.581 --> 11:49.165
I kind of insisted they keep it.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.085
I actually laid
in my parking space as a protest

11:52.086 --> 11:53.670
until they gave in.

11:53.671 --> 11:58.341
♪ And all sorts
of funny thoughts run... ♪

11:58.342 --> 12:01.803

12:01.804 --> 12:03.596
Um, are they setting up

12:03.597 --> 12:05.765
a buffet lunch for us
after this?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.225
No, I think it's just pizza.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.477
Can we please just
listen to the song?

12:09.478 --> 12:12.105

in the song?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.461
Do you not understand comedy?

12:34.462 --> 12:37.046
It's a reference.
The joke is I'm singing it.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.090
Sorry to break it to you--
that's not a joke.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.675
Damn it, now it's over.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.260
Thanks a lot, Lois.
You completely ruined it.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.262
You better not take
that tone with me,

12:44.263 --> 12:46.264
'cause this has been
one hell of a day.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.975
First, I find out you make
four times what I do.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.935
Then I find out
you were married before?

12:50.936 --> 12:52.437
I mean, what else don't I know?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.814
Well, if we're
being honest, Lois,

12:54.815 --> 12:57.025
you're really bad at having sex
when I'm drunk.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.693
It's like you don't even
enjoy it.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.903
You're impossible!

12:59.904 --> 13:02.197
Do not speak to the wicked.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.158
Throw heads of cabbage
at him.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.331
Damn it, Peter,
this is all your fault.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.958
They're not even going to
explain how we all got stuck?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.461
Season 16, ladies and gentlemen.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.838
Suddenly, the family is stuck
in the banister slats.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.048
Baluster.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.883
Brian, seriously,.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.384
I can get us out of here.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.178
I'm good at
figuring things out.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.263
Like when I figured out
the secret of business:

13:27.264 --> 13:28.890
pointing at stuff
during meetings.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.892
Peter, there's something
you don't know.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.686
Chris might not even
be your son.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.439
What?
I once slept with
Philip Seymour Hoffman.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.650
You what?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.652
These montage-style cutaway gags

13:40.653 --> 13:42.820
provide the animators
the freedom

13:42.821 --> 13:45.323
to go "beyond the page,"
as we say.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.034
You slept with
Philip Seymour Hoffman?

13:48.035 --> 13:49.786
I sure did.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.997
It was in his trailer during
that tornado chasing movie.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.375
And all I know is,
nine months later,

13:55.376 --> 13:56.709
Chris is born.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.586
Yay! I'm a bastard!

13:58.587 --> 14:00.505
This scene reminds me
of the time

14:00.506 --> 14:02.840
I was being honored
at the Kennedy Center...

14:02.841 --> 14:04.926
Oh, baloney sandwich, Sarah!

14:04.927 --> 14:06.594
Baloney sandwich!

14:06.595 --> 14:07.929
In fact, you know what?!

14:07.930 --> 14:09.889
I'm tired of it, Peter!

14:09.890 --> 14:12.934
You're dishonest,
you're disrespectful,

14:12.935 --> 14:14.811
and, frankly, I deserve better!

14:14.812 --> 14:17.063
So... so what are you
saying, Lois?

14:17.064 --> 14:20.024
I'm saying this marriage
is over.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.694
Enjoy spending the rest
of your life alone,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.113
and enjoy doing the show
without me, 'cause I quit!

14:26.949 --> 14:28.324
...building a chair
with my male friends.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.826
Yeah, I can't believe...

14:29.827 --> 14:31.703
Hi. Shannon Smith again.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.455
You know, if you need a new
Lois, I do a pretty good one.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.124
Peter!

14:36.125 --> 14:37.917
That was sad.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.670
Well, that was unexpected.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.010
Well, I really regret
confiscating

14:47.011 --> 14:48.761
everyone's phones now.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.847
How the hell
are we gonna get out of here?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.932
I got no idea,
but we're in trouble.

14:52.933 --> 14:56.060
Even more than when we were
literally in the game Trouble.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.354
Welcome back to the DVD
commentary episode.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.232
If you're just joining us,
Lois has stormed out

15:01.233 --> 15:03.443
and announced that she's
quitting the show after learning

15:03.444 --> 15:05.778
that Peter and Sarah Paulson
were once married.

15:05.779 --> 15:09.157
She also said Chris's dad
might be Philip Seymour Hoffman.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.410
More like See-less Hoffman
these days, right?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.454
Hey, Patrick,
can we edit that out?

15:14.455 --> 15:15.788
Yeah.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.165
Okay, good, let's do that.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.416
I don't see it.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.126
Okay, there's also
a real rock

15:20.127 --> 15:21.753
you can throw
through the glass.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.962
I found the fake one.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.173
Great.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.342
Oh, thank God.
Can you get us out of...

15:27.343 --> 15:30.012
Man, this is gonna be
easier than I thought.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.973
- Wait, you're robbing us?
- Sure am.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.517
And apparently,
I can take my sweet time.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.102
Dad, I'm really worried
about Mom.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.104
Should we maybe check on her?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.148
Or be thinking about
a paternity test for Chris?

15:42.149 --> 15:45.693
- You're right, Meg.
- This is awful.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.111
You think your mother's
actually serious

15:47.112 --> 15:49.072
about divorcing me
and quitting the show?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.991
And what was all that stuff
about Chris not being my son?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.493
That-that can't be true, right?

15:53.494 --> 15:56.287
It's a burglar party!

15:56.288 --> 15:59.123
Hey, remember the one day
that guy who plays the burglar

15:59.124 --> 16:01.209
was on set, he was
passing out postcards

16:01.210 --> 16:02.877
for his one-man show?

16:02.878 --> 16:04.545
- So tacky.
- I went.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.048
Wasn't bad. I think I sat
next to his girlfriend,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.885
'cause she laughed
at everything.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.972
I've got a package
for a... Brian Griffin.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.391
I'm Brian Griffin.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.892
Great. Sign here.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.185
Thanks.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.645
All right, you guys.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.231
Who's ready to have some fun?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.192
Hey, Brian,
they used your account

16:26.193 --> 16:27.985
to buy a karaoke machine.

16:27.986 --> 16:30.154
♪ Halfway down the stairs... ♪

16:30.155 --> 16:31.989
And she said no one
would know that song.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.991
Well, look.
The burglars know it.

16:33.992 --> 16:36.369
Oh, you're kidding me.
They're doing my song.

16:36.370 --> 16:40.039
♪ There isn't any other stair
quite like it... ♪

16:40.040 --> 16:42.709
I-I gotta go find your mother,
talk some sense back into her.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.086
SETH MacFARLANE:
No need, Peter.
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.462
- Seth MacFarlane.
- Holy crap.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.172
It's the mouse from Sing.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.799
I'd recognize your voice
anywhere.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.217
MacFARLANE:
Okay, settle down.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.261
Mr. MacFarlane...

16:53.262 --> 16:54.846
what are you doing here?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.180
MacFARLANE:
I'm actually here to tell you

16:56.181 --> 16:58.141
there's no need to talk sense
into Lois.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.726
Or for a paternity test.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.227
Or for anyone
to leave the show,

17:01.228 --> 17:03.229
because none of you are real.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.356
You're all TV characters
voiced by me,

17:05.357 --> 17:07.191
Alex Borstein, Seth Green
and Mila Kunis.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.776
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

17:08.777 --> 17:10.944
- Hi, everybody.
- Wait. What?

17:10.945 --> 17:12.155
Okay, ha-hang on a second.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.574
If I'm not real,
then why does a fat nerd

17:14.575 --> 17:16.409
pretend to be me
at every Comic-Con?

17:16.410 --> 17:18.286
MacFARLANE:
Please, please don't
mention him.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.121
- It'll only encourage him.
- And if you're me,

17:20.122 --> 17:21.955
then why do you sound
like my dog?

17:21.957 --> 17:23.958
MacFARLANE:
Because I'm also the voice
of your dog, Brian.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.417
Wait. You do my voice, too?

17:25.419 --> 17:26.961
MacFARLANE:
Yeah, I do your voice.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.380
So, the guy who handles
your money,

17:29.381 --> 17:31.215
he knows you by voice, right?

17:31.216 --> 17:33.050
That's usually just a call.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.470
- Wait a second.
- If Dad's not real,

17:35.471 --> 17:39.307
then he's not really my dad,
which means I'm not real?

17:39.308 --> 17:40.808
That's right, Meg.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.727
You're voiced by me, Mila Kunis.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.395
Okay, question:

17:44.396 --> 17:47.565
Why is the girl who voices me
super hot and I'm not?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.650
Aw, that's so sweet.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.278
You know, believe it or not,
I've actually had two kids.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.072
Um, Ms. Kunis, I would just
like you to know

17:55.073 --> 17:57.950
that I have no problem with you
breastfeeding in this booth.

17:57.951 --> 18:02.163
May I ask
if you're still producing?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.999
Uh, I, uh... no, uh, Chris,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.251
I'm-I'm not, uh...
uh, producing.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.170
- What about you, Miss Paulson?
- Are you producing?

18:09.171 --> 18:11.380
I can see coming here
was a mistake.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.216
Excuse me, Seth Green...

18:13.217 --> 18:15.676
- Chris, I'm a man.
- I-I can't produce.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.512
Actually, I just wanted to say

18:17.513 --> 18:19.514
I enjoy your brilliant work
on Robot Chicken.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.848
MacFARLANE:
Wait, Seth Green,

18:20.849 --> 18:22.099
are you feeding yourself
compliments now?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.143
Well, let's just hear Chris out.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.895
MacFARLANE:
Okay, you know what?
We're getting off track here.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.022
Like I was saying,
none of you actually exists.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.357
Yes, you keep saying that.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.858
Stop telling such horrible lies.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.610
Oh, Seth, since you're here,

18:32.611 --> 18:35.822
would you mind recording
episodes 1714, 15, 16,

18:35.823 --> 18:37.448
and an NFL on Fox promo?

18:37.449 --> 18:38.991
MacFARLANE:
Shannon, take a lap.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.284
Oh, hey, look.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.994
- Mom's back.
- Don't get excited.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.412
I forgot my paycheck.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.872
Lois, you can't leave the show.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.624
Oh, yeah? Why not?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.459
Well, the captain
of the Orville says

18:48.460 --> 18:50.628
that none of us are real--
we're all cartoon characters.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.630
Not real? What-what the hell
are you talking about?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.340
He's right, Lois.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.176
Uh, my name's Alex Borstein,
and I do your voice on the show.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.679
Are you saying the rough-edged
comedy manager

18:59.680 --> 19:02.181
from The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel
does my voice?

19:02.182 --> 19:04.517
I'm so honored.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.270
I love that show.
You are hilarious.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.272
Yeah, Seth Green
already did this bit.

19:09.273 --> 19:13.025
So, you're really saying
that we don't exist?

19:13.026 --> 19:15.236
Peter, I-I'm not even sure
what this means,

19:15.237 --> 19:17.238
but it sure makes it
seem less important

19:17.239 --> 19:19.782
how much money you make
compared to me

19:19.783 --> 19:22.118
or that maybe
you neglected to tell me

19:22.119 --> 19:23.870
everything about your past.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.246
Yeah, none of
that stuff matters.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.914
You're right, Peter.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.916
I love you,
and whatever we share,

19:28.917 --> 19:30.918
whether it's real or not,

19:30.919 --> 19:32.753
I don't want to give
any of it up.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.380
Me, either.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.091
It's safe and familiar
here with you.

19:37.092 --> 19:41.053
So let's just bury our troubles
and cling to whatever this is.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.723
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Philip Seymour Hoffman.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.182
It's fine. None of that matters.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.601
MacFARLANE:
Look, the truth is--

19:46.602 --> 19:48.102
again, this is Seth,
not Brian--

19:48.103 --> 19:49.937
the truth is,
you should all be thankful

19:49.938 --> 19:51.230
you're animated characters.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.149
Peter, you can drink
as much as you want,

19:53.150 --> 19:54.525
and nothing bad
will ever happen.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.027
Lois, you haven't aged
in decades.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.528
Stewie, you get to travel
through time

19:57.529 --> 19:59.113
and do things no baby
could ever do.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.699
And, Brian, you've had sex
with more hot women

20:01.700 --> 20:03.326
than a real dog
could ever reasonably expect.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.077
Meg, I'll admit,
you got the shaft.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.914
Your actual life is better
than your cartoon life.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.166
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need all the real actors

20:10.167 --> 20:12.960
to form a human shield around me
so I can get out of the building

20:12.961 --> 20:14.503
without the American Dad people
seeing me.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.464
Well, from now on, Peter,

20:16.465 --> 20:18.049
- I'm not going any...
- Quiet!

20:18.050 --> 20:20.176
My character's talking!

20:20.177 --> 20:22.220
Honestly, Peter,
I don't know how you...

20:22.221 --> 20:24.680
I know. That right there
was the main reason we split up.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.515
...wiped out by
the German aphid,

20:26.516 --> 20:28.184
which was oddly brought
by the Swedes

20:28.185 --> 20:30.019
during the Great Depression--

20:30.020 --> 20:32.063
which, for those of you
who are too young,

20:32.064 --> 20:34.690
was like a decade-long case
of the Mondays.

20:34.691 --> 20:38.277
Well, I'm guessing you folks
are from out of town, too.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.614
I never got that joke.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.206
Well, you guys, I guess we all
learned something

20:50.207 --> 20:53.125
about not letting technology
rule our lives.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.878
And, Mom, next time we get
baluster slats,

20:55.879 --> 20:59.048
let's make sure there's enough
room to get our heads out.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.762
Okay, thanks for watching this
outmoded form of entertainment.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.305
Now let's all go around the horn

21:06.306 --> 21:08.641
and say what our favorite part
of the episode was.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.976
- Chris?
- Pass.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.686
- Meg?
- Don't care.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.937
Okay, Stewie's asleep,

21:12.938 --> 21:15.064
and I can see Brian
driving away in his car.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.108
And just so you know,
he doesn't drive a Prius

21:17.109 --> 21:18.901
like you see on the show.

21:18.902 --> 21:21.070
He actually drives a white,
convertible Mercedes.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.031
Basically the car
a lady Realtor would drive.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.783
Oh, animation producer
Shannon Smith,

21:25.784 --> 21:26.993
I see you're still here.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.160
You want to say something?

21:28.161 --> 21:29.662
Thanks, Peter. Actually...

21:29.663 --> 21:31.081
Oh, Fuzzy Door. Bye.
