WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:05.108
Isn't it true that my client
was drugged and abducted

00:05.172 --> 00:08.278
from Tramble prison
against his will and better judgement?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.514
What better judgment?

00:09.610 --> 00:10.782
Yes or no, Deputy?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.050
Yes.

00:12.145 --> 00:15.285
And isn't it true
that my client was later drugged again

00:15.349 --> 00:18.455
and made to believe
that his kidneys had been removed?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.829
You might want to note for the record
he thought he had four kidneys.

00:21.154 --> 00:22.497
Your Honour,
would you please direct the witness?

00:22.556 --> 00:23.534
Yes.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.161
And isn't it true
that on the occasion of your first meeting,

00:26.226 --> 00:28.001
you broke Mr Crowds nose?

00:28.061 --> 00:29.734
Objection. No basis in evidence.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.831
Miss Keyhoe.

00:30.898 --> 00:34.038
I'm simply asking Deputy Givens to
corroborate his own report, Your Honour.

00:34.134 --> 00:35.306
Was that in the report?

00:35.369 --> 00:38.839
You grabbed his hair
and slammed his face into a steering wheel,

00:38.906 --> 00:40.385
and a few days later,

00:40.474 --> 00:42.715
you hit him in the nose
with the butt of a shotgun.

00:42.809 --> 00:43.981
Didn't you?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.183
I don't remember putting that in the report.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.884
Deputy, perhaps
you should just stipulate to having

00:47.981 --> 00:50.518
assaulted my client
on not less than a dozen occasions.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.562
Objection!

00:52.653 --> 00:55.327
Counsel, approach the bench.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.401
Miss Keyhoe,
you getting anywhere near a point?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.529
Your Honour,
I've got a long list of federal inmates

01:00.594 --> 01:02.938
that are prepared to testify to
their abuse at the hands of this man.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.407
Your Honour, that's bullshit.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.411
There's a $20,000 settlement
on the table, Miss Keyhoe.

01:07.501 --> 01:12.007
Mr Vasquez, this goes beyond
the abuses perpetuated against my client.

01:12.205 --> 01:14.048
I'm laying the foundation
for a class-action lawsuit

01:14.174 --> 01:18.384
against the United States Marshal Service
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.686
Vasquez. Just...

01:20.747 --> 01:22.090
- Your Honour.
- Two hundred.

01:22.182 --> 01:23.126
Two-fifty.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.422
- Little bit higher.
- Three hundred.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.758
Step back.

01:27.020 --> 01:31.526
Mr Crowe, a settlement offer of
$20,000 has already been made.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.038
The U.S. Attorney has modified it to 300.

01:34.795 --> 01:35.967
Do you accept that offer?

01:36.363 --> 01:37.865
No, I do not!

01:38.231 --> 01:42.543
After what I've been through...
My kidneys and everything...

01:42.736 --> 01:45.615
You telling me all I get is $300?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.882
$300,000, you nitwit.

02:01.722 --> 02:02.928
I'll take that as a yes.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.094
Next case.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.165
All right, they got you down for obstruction,
evidence tampering,

02:07.260 --> 02:08.294
and desecration of a corpse,

02:08.395 --> 02:09.931
which will get tossed
before we even get into court,

02:09.997 --> 02:13.308
unless you were actually
having sex with dead Delroy, which I doubt.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.744
Now, most lawyers
will tell you to plea it out anyway,

02:15.802 --> 02:18.806
but I don't plea bargain ever,
and that's why they call me the Wildman.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.282
Counsellor, may I interrupt?

02:20.340 --> 02:22.980
- Did you bring your headphones like I asked?
- Yeah, but...

02:23.076 --> 02:27.149
My fiancée and I need to have a conversation
without being recorded.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.351
What exactly are we talking about?

02:28.448 --> 02:30.655
Well, rest assured it will not be about you.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.924
So, put 'em on, plug 'em in,
and crank it to 10.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.866
What's going on?

02:45.966 --> 02:49.345
Baby, I'm ready
for whatever selection they make.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.279
McAllisters easy... Whores.

02:51.538 --> 02:54.382
Reynolds is a little more difficult,
but he's an alcoholic with money woes.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.283
Now, Judge Bishop...

02:56.877 --> 02:59.187
He's the wild card.
He's as honest as they come.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.987
I might have to threaten his family,
but the point is...

03:02.816 --> 03:06.696
I'm gonna do whatever I got to do
to get you out of here.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.561
How are you, Boyd?

03:10.290 --> 03:13.464
Sitting in your house in the country,
I feel like I'm in my own jail.

03:14.294 --> 03:19.073
But I know that this
will be back on your finger soon enough.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.384
Time's up!

03:52.199 --> 03:53.507
It's just the truck.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.192
Where are your lead and follow cars?

04:11.451 --> 04:14.261
We got separated back at one of the turns.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.534
- That the money?
- It is.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.265
But you don't get it until I see the shipment.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.601
I don't know how many of
these rodeos you been to, friend.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.731
That's not how it works.

04:24.364 --> 04:27.368
Well, that's how
it's gonna work tonight, friend.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.780
How about you toss that briefcase over here?

04:36.309 --> 04:37.413
Ross?

04:37.711 --> 04:40.055
When I shoot him,
get that briefcase out of his dead hands.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.464
No, this ain't my first rodeo.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.764
- Carl!
- I got you, Boyd!

04:49.322 --> 04:52.496
Now, you ain't got any dope
in that truck, do you, son?

04:52.592 --> 04:55.334
You got to understand. Detroit's in free fall.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.305
- We never got the dope.
- So, what?

04:57.397 --> 05:01.436
You figured you'd drive south anyway,
rip off the simple people?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.073
Well, we ain't that simple.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.311
Now, you got a man inside that truck?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.012
What's his name?

05:11.178 --> 05:12.248
Donny.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.258
Donny?

05:23.590 --> 05:27.629
Now, you must've heard
what just happened to your friends.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.106
I'd imagine you want to avoid a similar fate.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.338
Now, why don't you slide
that door open four inches

05:34.434 --> 05:36.812
and ease whatever weapons
you have out butt first.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.108
God damn it!

05:53.520 --> 05:54.726
Boyd, he got your ear.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.794
I know. I'm the one who got shot!

06:04.965 --> 06:06.410
It's Crowder.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.917
I didn't take you for a tennis fan, Mr Crowder,

06:15.008 --> 06:17.682
but the only reason
I can see you calling at this hour

06:17.744 --> 06:19.587
is to discuss Azarenka's last match.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.353
I had to kill three deliverymen, I got no dope,

06:22.415 --> 06:24.326
and my ear's damn near been shot off.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.665
Pack a bag. We're going 10 Detroit.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.938
You're late.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.651
We have a shipment coming in...
Port of Miami.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.221
Can I get one of those?

07:29.382 --> 07:31.658
Why don't we just get this done with?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.495
The money.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.461
- How short is this?
- Not a lot.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.266
- Fifty.
- Fifty's half.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.398
Halfs a lot. What'd you do this time?

07:45.332 --> 07:46.936
What kind of questions that?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.480
Well, if you were a cook,
I'd say, "What's cooking?"

07:49.569 --> 07:52.982
But since you're a screw-up,
I'm asking about that.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.745
Hey. You best not make fun of me.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.678
Where's the rest of the money?

07:57.777 --> 07:59.654
That's all we got from the candy company.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.090
Yeah? Which candy company is that, Dilly?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.423
The one that bought the sugar.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.326
He insisted we stop at the Apalachee Casino.

08:08.421 --> 08:12.164
Indian casinos are
rigged against the white man.

08:12.258 --> 08:13.760
That's a fact.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.165
Then why'd you go?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.672
Can't win if you don't play, choo choo.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.005
I had an arrangement
with the Machado family...

08:20.100 --> 08:21.101
Not this moron.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.342
So, if I'm gonna be dealing with the Crowes,
I want to deal with the other brother.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.513
No! No! You can! do that.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.011
Why is that?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.453
The only reason I went to the Apalachee

08:31.511 --> 08:34.890
is 'cause I already lost
a bundle of the family's money on the dogs,

08:34.981 --> 08:36.119
and I had to make it up.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.351
Darryl like as not to beat my ass,
he finds out.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.488
Gator Boy is gonna get us all arrested.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.693
Come on. Nobody gonna touch you.
You're a cop.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.497
I'm a coastguard, you...

08:49.729 --> 08:51.299
Now, what'd you do that for?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.674
Tired of him making fun of me!

09:00.974 --> 09:02.248
He alive?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.416
Not anymore.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.654
I didn't leave Cuba for this shit.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.064
I have good news for you.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.570
What'd I do now?

09:20.660 --> 09:21.661
Simon Lee.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.904
Off-duty Florida Coast Guard officer
under investigation by the feds

09:25.999 --> 09:27.603
as missing and presumed dead.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.841
If that's the good news,
I don't want to hear the bad.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.443
Suspect is a Cuban national,

09:32.539 --> 09:35.679
violent career criminal
by the name of Elvis Manuel Machado.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.914
Must be a story there.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.286
Fugitive Task Force
is looking for Mr Machado,

09:39.379 --> 09:40.585
and among his known associates...

09:40.680 --> 09:42.853
Dillon Crowe, aka Dilly.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.084
I believe you know him.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.390
Figured he'd be dead by now.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.898
That's why I told the Task Force
that you'd be assisting them.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.093
- Art?
- Yeah, you get to Dilly to get to Machado.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.396
Think of it like a family trip.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.903
The Crowes are a terrible family.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.604
I'm not talking about their family.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.605
I'm talking about your family.
You got a kid down there.

09:56.696 --> 09:57.868
- Yeah, of course.
- Well, there you go.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.704
Quality time is
very important when they're little.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.908
Look, Art. I'd love to see my child,

10:03.970 --> 10:06.075
but before we go spending taxpayer money
on the ticket,

10:06.139 --> 10:09.450
I'd like to remind you we've got a perfectly
good Crowe right here in Kentucky.

10:09.542 --> 10:13.456
Yes, we're all familiar with Mr Dewey Crowe,
but why would he help you?

10:13.546 --> 10:14.547
He owes me a favour.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.988
Figure he owes you about 300,000 favours.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.825
I'll go see Dewey, get to the bottom of this.
Be back before you know it.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.227
You leave today!

10:30.396 --> 10:32.069
Well... Hey, Raylan.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.436
Wade.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.573
Can I get you a blowjob or something?

10:37.570 --> 10:38.640
Just some water.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.246
I didn't mean me, of course.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.590
Guess what. I got out of prison.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.427
- Did you?
- Yeah. Got out of prison.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.521
Rode Dickie Bennett's shirttails out of
Tramble, on account of the scandal?

10:53.620 --> 10:54.655
How'd you know?

10:54.754 --> 10:56.665
It's protocol to tell me when a known felon

10:56.756 --> 10:59.498
who's tried to kill me
a couple times has been released.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.936
In case they get it in their head to try again.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.539
Well, it sounds like a good policy.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.003
I'm here for the owner.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.967
Boyd? He don't own the place no more.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.444
I'm looking for the new owner.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.514
- Marco!
Polo!

11:17.277 --> 11:19.279
- Marco!
Polo!

11:20.480 --> 11:22.221
- Marco!
Polo!

11:23.016 --> 11:24.962
- Wade, I told you...
- Don't blame Wade.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.826
God damn it.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.958
Now, is that any way
to greet your old courtroom buddy Raylan?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.502
Out of the pool, please, ladies.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.628
Hey. No. Hey, hey!

11:32.692 --> 11:35.002
You work for him or me?
I say they're staying.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.802
- Now, this is my place.
- You don't do as I say,

11:37.330 --> 11:40.971
I'm gonna haul 'em in
for impeding a federal investigation.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.809
If I start arresting girls,
how's that for business, Dewey?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.146
You and Wade
the only two pussies in this whorehouse?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.483
It's okay, Dewey. We'll be inside.

11:52.979 --> 11:56.825
Federal investigation' my ass.
You just here to get some payback.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.155
You, too... Out of the pool.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.924
You just pissed
'cause I got one over on you in court.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.999
Well, go ahead!

12:07.527 --> 12:10.906
Hit me. I'll probably get
another $20,000, $30,000 for that.

12:10.997 --> 12:14.570
I'm here about a dead Coast Guard officer.
The suspect's tight with your cousins.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.668
Jesus Christ!

12:15.735 --> 12:18.113
That's what you got me out here
freezing my balls off for?

12:18.204 --> 12:20.707
I want you to tell me
where a Florida Task Force can find him.

12:20.773 --> 12:21.843
Save me the trip.

12:22.508 --> 12:25.751
Yeah, how about this?
I don't say shit until I get my robe.

12:25.845 --> 12:26.846
Stay put.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.184
I'll get it for you.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.191
This Boyd's idea, you buying this place?

12:32.352 --> 12:34.889
I told him I want to put my money to work.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.592
Yeah? He offered to sell you Audry's?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.797
I don't remember whose idea it was.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.201
How about this gun in your pocket?
Whose idea was that?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.207
I never seen that. That ain't even loaded.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.209
Nickle-plated. Engraved.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.937
I believe that says "Dewey."

12:48.034 --> 12:49.104
It's a common name.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.647
You're a convicted felon.
You know that, don't you?

12:51.738 --> 12:53.445
As such, you're not allowed the God-given,

12:53.539 --> 12:57.282
American right of carrying
a concealed weapon, loaded or unloaded.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.617
Now, am I gonna have to arrest you

12:58.711 --> 13:00.418
or are you gonna tell me
what I need to know?

13:00.480 --> 13:04.326
Yeah, I'll tell you what I know.
I know you owe me an apology.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.625
Dewey, I believe
the $300,000 was the apology.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.133
No, I ain't talking about the government.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.397
- I'm talking about you, Raylan Givens.
- I'm sorry.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.837
Now, you come hereto my place...

13:16.729 --> 13:17.730
What?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.642
I said I'm sorry, Dewey.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.308
You ain't gonna bust my nose again?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.609
I'm gonna shoot your balls off
and feed 'em to the squirrels,

13:24.671 --> 13:25.809
you don't tell me what you know.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.946
I don't know shit about no dead Coast Guard.

13:29.008 --> 13:29.986
What about your kin?

13:30.076 --> 13:31.919
I don't know about that, either,
and I don't want to know.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.616
Them Florida Crowes are bad news.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.127
- Dewey.
- I told you I don't know shit!

13:37.450 --> 13:38.588
Okay.?-

13:39.919 --> 13:41.921
Relax. I believe you.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.368
God damn it!

13:50.029 --> 13:51.440
Get a bucket or something!

13:57.637 --> 13:59.776
Raylan. Look at you.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.112
This is Greg Sutter.
Greg's gonna be your chauffeur.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.382
Chauffeur or babysitter?

14:04.477 --> 14:05.478
Heard a lot about you.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.956
- Nothing good, I trust.
- All interesting.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.959
- Got any baby pictures?
- Not on me.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.359
What do you think? James or Wade?

14:11.451 --> 14:12.862
- Boy or girl?
- Girl.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.556
I'd go with Wade.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.029
Elvis Manuel Machado.

14:18.124 --> 14:21.901
He's a family enforcer. Machados are
Cuban nationals, known drug-smugglers.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.530
- Cocaine or weed?
Sugar.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.199
Yeah, embargoed sugar from Cuba.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.404
Once it's here, they sell it below market
to low-rent candy companies.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.845
Like the Dollar Store knock-offs
of Mike and Ikes.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.883
- Sure.
- Got most of the Task Force of South Florida

14:32.972 --> 14:34.144
looking for him right now.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.313
And a handful running down an associate
Dilly Crowe, or one of his brothers.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.879
Darryl Crowe Junior just got parole.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.584
He reported twice and then
absconded from his last known address.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.716
That's where I come in.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.253
That's where you come in.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.727
I'm pretty sure Billy's the dimmest of the lot,

14:52.825 --> 14:55.169
and that's saying something.

14:55.228 --> 14:59.574
The only time I met him
was out near Belle Glade by Clewiston.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.236
They were poaching gators as a sideline.

15:02.335 --> 15:06.579
That was the day I picked up Darryl Junior
and hauled him off to Starke.

15:07.673 --> 15:11.246
I just figured
they'd all be locked up or dead by now.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.724
- You flinched!
- Did not!

15:20.787 --> 15:21.891
You flinched, you little pussy.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.690
Hey! Darryl!

15:24.757 --> 15:25.792
What, Dilly? I'm busy.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.930
Yeah. About this payoff
for next week's shipment.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.770
Yeah. You ain't got to worry about that.
I told the island beaner take care of that.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.242
- Yeah. well... Well, we did that, but...
- What you mean "we"?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.208
I told him
he's not supposed to come with me,

15:36.269 --> 15:38.044
but you know your brother.
He won't listen to me.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.873
Danny, that dog shits in the house

15:39.939 --> 15:41.475
'cause of the racket,
I'm gonna make y'all two eat it!

15:41.574 --> 15:43.918
Anyway, Darryl.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.456
So, we go over there with the...

15:46.546 --> 15:47.718
- With the money.
- Yeah, all of it.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.752
And he says, "I'm out."

15:50.550 --> 15:51.585
- Hey! Watch out!
- Excuse?

15:51.651 --> 15:55.963
Yeah, I told him that he was
the key to the entire sugar operation,

15:56.055 --> 15:59.229
and he says to me,
"Well, I don't give a shit," so I shot him.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.068
- You killed him?
- Technically, I did.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.665
Danny!

16:05.765 --> 16:07.642
If I move, I lose.

16:07.733 --> 16:08.734
Danny, get!

16:11.571 --> 16:13.949
This like that mess
you caused at Loxahatchee, ain't it, Dilly?

16:14.006 --> 16:16.612
- Come on, Darryl.
- Where's the body?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.417
They find the body,
they're gonna find your bullets in him.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.923
No, no, no. We got the body.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.587
Where at?

16:21.747 --> 16:22.851
In the boat.

16:23.950 --> 16:27.762
He tried to blow the whistle on us, Darryl.
I mean, he was gonna turn us in.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.523
- Darryl, he was gonna bring down the family.
- Shut up.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.000
You're dumb. Dumb. Dumb ass!

16:35.261 --> 16:36.968
This gonna turn federal.

16:37.029 --> 16:41.444
This gonna turn into a federal situation,
and when it does, you two are dealing with it,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.607
'cause I'll bury you and Desi Arnaz
before I let you ruin this family!

16:44.670 --> 16:46.547
You understand me?

16:46.706 --> 16:51.212
Now, go on, take that body to the Haitian,
and pay him to make it disappear.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.480
You understand me, Dilly?

16:55.114 --> 16:56.957
Dilly, say "I understand"
before I smack the shit out you.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.826
- I understand.
- You're a dumb, simple, stupid ass!

17:09.628 --> 17:11.631
All right, coming down!

17:21.840 --> 17:23.684
Well, I guess texting would take too long.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.222
You not been paying attention?

17:25.478 --> 17:29.051
They intercepting everything...
Satellites and drones and shit.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.086
You ever been to Detroit?

17:31.317 --> 17:34.992
I have. I don't believe
Mr Crowder's ever been outside Kentucky.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.533
Well, I have been to Iraq.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.592
It's a lot like Detroit,
except you have better music.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.165
What happened to your ear?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.332
Ceiling fan.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.065
Back at you!

17:50.002 --> 17:52.573
Duffy, you up. Along with this cracker.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.848
But your other dudes stay here.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.116
Through that door.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.923
Hey, hold up. Hold up.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.758
Take these.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.593
How far?

18:10.890 --> 18:12.096
Till you run out of stairs.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.446
Shit. I know that guy.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.458
No, no, no, no. We closed.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.162
Not why we're here.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.294
Fish and Wildlife?

18:48.394 --> 18:50.635
U.S. Marshals after fugitives, not alligators.

18:51.230 --> 18:54.473
Looking for a Cuban
goes by the name of Elvis Manuel Machado.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.141
- Don't know no Elvises.
- You sure?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.641
He's real close
with your friends Darryl Junior,

18:59.739 --> 19:02.242
Dilly, and all them other Crowes.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.953
You don't remember me, do you?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.920
- I give you that tour one time?
- Close.

19:09.348 --> 19:10.486
It was here we met.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.658
I came by with a search warrant,
looking for Darryl.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.164
I told you he was in that trailer.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.495
Opened the door,
120-pound mastiff jumped out.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.625
Bit me on the leg.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.136
Took 10 stitches and a tetanus shot.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.832
I had tickets
to Tom Petty with ZZ Top up in Tampa.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.931
Never made it, though,
'cause I had to come back here,

19:25.998 --> 19:27.102
find Darryl hiding out in the shitter.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.771
Darryl not here.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.036
We're not after Darryl.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.207
Just hoping
he and his brother can help us find Elvis.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.146
Nothing happened to you, though, did it?

19:34.206 --> 19:38.348
You're still here, hanging out,
pretending to be Tonton Macoute.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.617
You know what that means...
Tonton Macoute?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.123
"Uncle Gunnysack."

19:44.450 --> 19:46.896
He puts bad children in his sack,

19:47.153 --> 19:49.633
and then he eats 'em for breakfast.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.893
It's just a fairy tale
to scare the little ones, is all.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.901
Still poaching gators for the Crowes, huh?

19:55.995 --> 19:59.204
No poaching. We guides now.
Even got state tags.

19:59.298 --> 20:02.006
Take you on trip way up to the Everglades,
you want hunt gator.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.481
Maybe you like it so much...
You never come back.

20:06.338 --> 20:07.840
I tried to skip this trip,

20:07.907 --> 20:10.581
take care of this in Kentucky
with Darryl's cousin Dewey.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.088
He came into a boatload of money.
You hear about that?

20:13.179 --> 20:15.523
No, but all this
conversation's making me hungry.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.219
- You hungry?
- I could eat.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.421
Gonna go to that Coopertown restaurant
on Tamiami Trail.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.758
- You know it?
- It's no good.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.332
Good. That'll give you about an hour

20:22.388 --> 20:25.494
to get a hold of Darryl and the boys
and see if you can get them to help us out.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.596
If you cannot, we're gonna come back here
with your friends from Fish and Wildlife.

20:28.694 --> 20:31.004
See how many gator carcasses
you got in that shack.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.049
Yeah, I'm gonna get you
the money I owe you.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.287
Who was looking for me?

21:28.087 --> 21:30.158
<i>We've got something on the radar.</i>

21:35.561 --> 21:36.596
Yo.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.233
Come here.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.512
Gas is here!

21:45.638 --> 21:47.675
Turn around. Turn around, man.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.346
We were frisked downstairs.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.480
Well, you're upstairs now.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.287
What happened to your ear?

21:55.347 --> 21:57.327
There's a fella downstairs
looks a lot like you.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.293
Why don't you ask him?

22:10.429 --> 22:12.431
Yeah, that was last week.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.009
Must've been quite a party.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.707
Gentlemen. Sorry about the hike.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.808
On account of his dispute
with the Canadians,

22:21.874 --> 22:24.013
Sammy needed 14 floors
between him and the street.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.680
It's not the hike
you should be apologising for, Mr Picker.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.850
It's the fact that this trip was even necessary.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.622
Yeah, well, those guys
who tried to jack you acted on their own.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.287
You'd think in a city
with 17% unemployment,

22:34.353 --> 22:36.993
we would get better help. But...

22:37.857 --> 22:38.961
Is that the money?

22:39.024 --> 22:41.504
It is, but I'm not gonna give it to you.

22:42.127 --> 22:45.540
My mama always said, "You want clear
water, go to the head of the stream."

22:45.631 --> 22:48.544
I think what Mr Crowder
is saying is we'd like to speak to Mr Tonin.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.309
Not a problem.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.143
Sammy!

22:54.473 --> 22:55.816
Yo, Sammy!

23:00.646 --> 23:01.750
That was last week.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.318
Sammy, we got company here! Come on!

23:07.186 --> 23:09.063
- The guys from Kentucky are here.
- Who is it?

23:09.154 --> 23:11.532
- Who are you?
- Mr Tonin, my name is Wynn Duffy.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.069
This is my associate Mr Crowder.

23:13.158 --> 23:14.364
What are you doing here?

23:14.426 --> 23:16.235
Why would anyone walk
up 14 flights of stairs?

23:16.328 --> 23:18.171
To buy the dope we've been promised.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.001
I... I was supposed...

23:26.171 --> 23:27.172
Canadian.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.047
The money's in the briefcase, okay?

23:30.843 --> 23:31.844
What?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.015
Don't you want it?

23:33.178 --> 23:35.021
- Yeah, I want it.
- Well, go get it.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.811
Yeah, it's me. Sammy's dead.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.476
Yeah, I put Doug out of his misery, too.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.716
Yeah, and I had to shoot the chainsaw guy.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.379
Sorry. Shit happens.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.281
Yeah, they still are. Okay.

24:07.546 --> 24:09.219
See you shortly.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.391
I'm gonna need that briefcase now.

24:27.232 --> 24:28.677
Shit, man! This doesn't concern me!

24:29.101 --> 24:30.307
So what should you do?

24:31.904 --> 24:33.406
You were saying?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.247
I'm sorry. Would you say that again?

24:36.775 --> 24:40.587
Sammy owes the Canadians
almost a million dollars.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.648
When I heard you were coming,
I cut a deal with the Canadians.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.024
- I give them the money...
- Our money.

24:45.117 --> 24:48.690
And I kill Sammy, and in exchange,
they wouldn't kill me.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.599
Well, it sounds like we need to
have a conversation with the Canucks.

24:55.461 --> 24:57.668
Now, pick up my goddamn money.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.381
Went to Oklahoma State.
Joined the Marshals.

25:05.471 --> 25:08.145
Met my wife, Julie. Been married 24 years.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.187
Got two boys walking this earth.

25:10.776 --> 25:14.019
Good guys. Smart One's a teacher.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.354
The others finishing
his second novel in New York.

25:16.448 --> 25:17.449
I said, "What's it about?"

25:17.516 --> 25:21.623
He said, "The subtext
is exposure of artistic pretension."

25:24.857 --> 25:27.030
Then there's our little girl, Kate.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.834
She's a senior now. Wants to be a marshal.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.033
I better get busy.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.200
How long you been married?

25:32.297 --> 25:34.470
- I'm divorced.
- Yeah, I figured.

25:34.533 --> 25:39.380
Well, I think this
Darryl Crowe Juniors a no-show.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.144
You serious about going back
and busting that Haitian for poaching?

25:43.208 --> 25:44.380
That's what I told him I was gonna do.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.922
Well, how about we don't do that?

25:47.079 --> 25:49.889
You go see your ex-wife and little girl.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.825
Sounds like a good idea.
You know this woman?

25:52.751 --> 25:54.526
No, but I'd like to.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.321
Marshals.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.528
You must be Raylan Givens.

25:58.657 --> 25:59.658
I am.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.114
I've been retained to
represent Darryl Crowe Junior.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.511
Darryl got your message.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.617
He wants you to know
that he's willing to help you,

26:14.706 --> 26:16.583
but he needs your help in exchange.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.382
- Help with what?
- His parole.

26:18.444 --> 26:19.514
He wants to end it early.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.355
We're marshals.
We can't end anybody's parole.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.122
Well, you can tell a judge
that Darryl aided you

26:25.217 --> 26:27.720
in the apprehension of a federal fugitive.

26:27.786 --> 26:30.232
That coupled with
his exemplary record as prisoner

26:30.289 --> 26:32.269
is evidence of his full rehabilitation.

26:32.357 --> 26:34.359
- You really believe that?
- Yes. I do.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.530
Then you don't know Darryl.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.766
I know him pretty well.

26:36.862 --> 26:37.966
What are you, his girlfriend?

26:38.063 --> 26:39.269
Sister.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.234
Where's Darryl now?

26:41.300 --> 26:44.611
Before we go any further,
I'd like you to sign a memo.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.736
Long time, Raylan.

27:13.065 --> 27:16.410
Your sister says you've
rehabilitated yourself. Congratulations.

27:16.668 --> 27:19.171
I owe that to you.
If you hadn't brought me in,

27:19.271 --> 27:22.411
I never could've taken all them
classes on the government's dime.

27:23.408 --> 27:26.582
I ain't got no weapon.
That'd be a violation of my parole.

27:26.678 --> 27:29.181
You won't be offended,
I don't take your word for it, huh?

27:29.281 --> 27:31.693
You study anything on
the sugar-import business?

27:31.783 --> 27:33.319
Nope. We ain't get to that class.

27:33.418 --> 27:36.922
Maybe something about
customs enforcement or maritime law?

27:36.989 --> 27:40.664
I see where you're going,
but that's more Elvis Machado's line.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.606
We got the idea
he might be working for you now.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.198
Hear he spends a lot of time with Dilly.

27:45.297 --> 27:49.712
Yeah, well, I told Dilly, "People gonna judge
you by the company you keep."

27:49.801 --> 27:52.611
But young Dilly
got himself a terrible stubborn streak.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.013
How about this? You start playing games,

27:55.107 --> 27:56.882
we'll violate your parole on account of you

27:56.975 --> 27:59.956
absconded from your most recent address
without notifying your PO.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.389
He's willing to cooperate.

28:01.613 --> 28:02.683
On his terms.

28:02.781 --> 28:06.957
Damn. I'm just asking for some leeway
in putting together a plan, is all.

28:07.619 --> 28:08.791
Y'all have him by tonight.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.533
Or tomorrow, you go back to Starke.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.301
- Wasn't no good?
- No.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.967
See, I told you
we should've gone to Timmy's.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.636
Hey, do you guys have
Tim Hortons in Kentucky?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.702
- Here we go.
- It's a doughnut shop.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.371
It's a Canadian doughnut shop.
You forgot to mention...

28:25.470 --> 28:26.710
Well, they might have them down here.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.648
Look, I like doughnuts
as much as the next fella,

28:28.707 --> 28:29.708
but we've had a very long...

28:29.808 --> 28:30.878
Tim Horton was a hockey player.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.889
He played 20 years in the NHL.
He won four Stanley Cups with the Leafs.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.216
Now all he's remembered for is doughnuts.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.660
Yeah, well, that,
and dying in a police chase on the QEW.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.422
What happened to your ear?

28:41.520 --> 28:43.522
I was shot while being robbed
by one of the men

28:43.589 --> 28:45.330
who was supposed to bring us our dope,

28:45.557 --> 28:48.037
which is the reason
I'm sitting here eating a shitty doughnut,

28:48.093 --> 28:50.004
talking to you with this briefcase in my hand.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.235
Now can we get down to business?

28:52.331 --> 28:54.743
That briefcase was
to keep us from killing Mr Picker.

28:54.833 --> 28:55.937
Well, the thing is...

28:56.034 --> 28:58.241
Half the money
in this briefcase belongs to me,

28:58.337 --> 29:00.908
and Mr Picker ain't my problem.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.384
If you want to keep things simple,

29:03.442 --> 29:05.422
we could add you
and Mr Eyebrows here to the list.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.252
And here I thought
all Canadians were supposed to be nice.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.551
Wrong Canadians.

29:09.615 --> 29:13.563
What he's trying to say is we're
through doing business with you people.

29:13.785 --> 29:17.858
The idea behind organised crime
is that it's supposed to be organised.

29:18.690 --> 29:21.637
When people start using chainsaws,
that's a sign.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.365
And it is not a good sign.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.600
Where's our dope?

29:28.734 --> 29:29.940
All right.

29:30.035 --> 29:31.207
One more shipment. That's it.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.973
- When?
- We'll call you.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.779
Two days. Maybe three.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.989
Mr Crowder. The briefcase.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.467
You can go now, Mr Picker.

30:03.101 --> 30:04.910
You sure about that?

30:05.337 --> 30:07.908
You just lost your Canadian pipeline.

30:08.307 --> 30:12.016
You want to stay in the game?
You have to look to Mexico.

30:12.110 --> 30:15.614
Well, I think we worked together
long enough, don't you?

30:16.748 --> 30:18.193
You know people in Mexico, Mr Picker?

30:19.785 --> 30:21.787
I know lots of people in Mexico.

30:23.922 --> 30:27.836
No. No. Well, what do you want me to do?

30:27.926 --> 30:29.200
He's a goddamn liability.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.364
This wasn't Dilly's fault.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.036
I know. It's yours.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.004
It was yours, dipshit.

30:34.099 --> 30:35.373
Putting him in position to screw up?

30:35.467 --> 30:38.641
Man, we wouldn't even be here,
you hadn't stopped handling the payoffs.

30:38.704 --> 30:43.619
I have a job, Darryl. Do you remember that?
I am a paralegal in Miami.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.847
You ain't shit.

30:44.943 --> 30:47.287
You're a secretary getting old men coffee.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.350
Well, this secretary's
helping get your ass out of parole.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.894
That's right.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.290
What you think they're talking about?

30:57.322 --> 30:59.165
How should I know?

30:59.224 --> 31:01.966
You want to find out? Get closer.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.085
So you fancy now, right?

31:20.178 --> 31:22.715
- I been taking care of this family 14 years.
- I know.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.657
- Fourteen years!
- Darryl, I...

31:24.716 --> 31:27.856
Shit! Dilly,
I told you to stay with the goddamn Cuban.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.331
- Where is he?
- I'm here.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.493
Cool.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.226
Look here, man.

31:34.159 --> 31:37.038
I'm gonna say this
in a language that's real simple

31:37.429 --> 31:38.908
that I think you can understand.

31:39.931 --> 31:41.171
You out.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.771
What's that supposed to mean?

31:45.871 --> 31:49.785
We ain't got no more sugar business,
so your services ain't no longer required.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.117
No more sugar biz
'cause you people screwed it up.

31:53.211 --> 31:54.349
Now you want me gone?

31:55.180 --> 31:56.352
See, you understand.

31:58.683 --> 32:01.061
You want me gone, pay me.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.725
Pay you? Shit. Pay you?

32:03.855 --> 32:06.062
- $20,000.
- Ain't nobody paying you.

32:06.124 --> 32:07.603
- Pay him, Darryl.
- I ain't paying this...

32:07.793 --> 32:11.104
Pay the man. Think of it as severance.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.274
Listen to your sister, Darryl.

32:18.970 --> 32:21.610
All right, my sister
gonna take you to your motel.

32:21.706 --> 32:22.912
Lay low.

32:23.041 --> 32:27.581
Gonna be there by 8:00 with your money.
Wendy, take your car.

32:27.712 --> 32:28.747
Why can't I take my truck?

32:28.814 --> 32:32.125
'Cause you can't take your truck.
They gonna be looking for your truck.

32:32.951 --> 32:33.986
Now I'm gonna pat you down.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.328
Hey, man. I ain't putting
an armed man in a car with my sister.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.565
What? You don't trust me?

32:44.429 --> 32:45.840
Hell no' I don't trust you.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.078
Trust nobody
who speaks English as a second language.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.281
- You ain't got no gun?
- Got rid of it.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.683
Threw it in the saw grass
after we shot the China.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.010
When?

32:56.174 --> 32:57.346
When you weren't looking.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.251
All right, go on.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.163
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they just left.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.333
Slight change of plans, though.

33:21.433 --> 33:25.279
She's taking him to
the Vista Verde Motel in Miami. Room 23.

33:26.438 --> 33:30.443
Yeah, Elvis will be there wailing for me.
8:00. All right.

33:32.444 --> 33:36.017
They get Elvis,
it's gonna come back and bite us in the ass.

33:36.114 --> 33:41.188
Yeah, well, knowing Elvis the way I do
and knowing Raylan the way I do,

33:41.286 --> 33:44.199
you think either one of them's gonna be
alive by the end of the day?

33:44.289 --> 33:47.133
Well, what about me, Darryl?

33:53.298 --> 33:55.835
Ain't nobody looking for you, Dilly.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.639
Okay.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.483
Dilly.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.500
I'm sorry.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.380
- I guessed right.
- About what?

34:39.511 --> 34:40.853
About what car we would take.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.946
How would you feel
if your daughter wanted to be a marshal?

35:09.040 --> 35:11.213
I don't know. Why? Does it bother you?

35:11.409 --> 35:14.652
Well, I know you can't live their lives for 'em.

35:14.746 --> 35:18.387
First time she mentioned she wanted to
be a marshal, she was nine years old.

35:19.150 --> 35:23.621
Every night since then, I've snuck
into her room after she's fallen asleep,

35:23.722 --> 35:27.966
and I whisper in her ear, "Business school."

35:39.904 --> 35:41.247
Well, shit.

35:42.607 --> 35:44.280
You know we can't drive to Cuba.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.948
There's a marina down here.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.987
Miss Crowe, we are at the motel.
Where are you?

36:51.409 --> 36:52.581
Well, then, where's Elvis?

36:54.312 --> 36:56.087
Headed for Cuba.

37:27.278 --> 37:28.723
Yo! Elvis!

37:28.780 --> 37:30.191
Where the hell do you think you're going?

37:38.089 --> 37:39.568
That gives you two choices.

37:39.858 --> 37:43.704
You can come back here,
and we'll take you in, or swim to Cuba.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.708
That old lady just did it.
Might work out for you.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.707
Third choice.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.400
It all work out?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.901
Elvis did not make it to Cuba.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.472
I meant the other part.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.137
I put a call in to the judge this morning.

38:25.270 --> 38:26.408
Deal's a deal.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.615
Calls for a celebration.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.745
I'm sorry I can't stay.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.646
She took off this morning.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.754
- Back to Miami.
- Wendy?

38:38.183 --> 38:41.494
Almost like the word "family"
don't mean shit to some people no more.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.031
What about Danny and Dilly?

38:44.122 --> 38:45.465
What about 'em?

38:45.523 --> 38:46.524
How'd they take it?

38:48.259 --> 38:50.330
Shit rolls off Danny's back.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.269
Dilly...

38:52.764 --> 38:54.300
He took it kind of hard.

38:56.201 --> 38:59.182
When my daddy, Darryl Senior,
died 14 years ago April,

38:59.270 --> 39:01.978
he made me promise him on his deathbed...

39:02.640 --> 39:06.952
I'd keep this family together.
Same like he did.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.517
No money makes it harder.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.695
Your daddy didn't die in his bed.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.959
He got drunk and flipped his airboat.

39:17.989 --> 39:21.232
You told me yourself,
the day I took you to prison.

39:26.564 --> 39:29.340
Listen, if you want to take a later flight,
I can drop you by West Palm.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.344
I haven! slept or showered in a day.

39:32.403 --> 39:33.882
Maybe next time, huh?

39:33.972 --> 39:35.645
I'll decide on the way.

39:39.577 --> 39:43.855
At one point, about 20 years ago,
I got transferred to Kansas City.

39:44.482 --> 39:48.396
I didn't want to uproot the kids
in the middle of the school year,

39:48.486 --> 39:50.056
so my wife and kids stayed in Houston.

39:50.154 --> 39:53.158
I'd just fly in on the weekends to see 'em.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.728
Took me a few visits to realise
the hardest thing wasn't living apart.

39:56.828 --> 40:00.071
The hardest thing was
looking at those little pigs' faces

40:00.164 --> 40:02.701
on Sunday night and saying goodbye.

40:03.701 --> 40:07.843
Sometimes, if work kept me
in Kansas City for the weekend,

40:08.106 --> 40:09.847
I didn't fight it.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.296
What am I gonna do, <i>mon ami?</i>

40:30.128 --> 40:32.438
The same as your family did
with the phosphate miners

40:32.530 --> 40:34.942
and the Machado's family Cuban sugar.

40:35.033 --> 40:38.207
You'll find something and make it yours.

40:39.771 --> 40:44.777
That's all well and good,
but I'm afraid I'm fresh out of ideas.

40:45.643 --> 40:48.783
I'm afraid Florida's tapped out
for the Crowes.

40:49.814 --> 40:53.762
Let me ask you something.
Do you have a cousin Dewey in Kentucky?

41:09.334 --> 41:10.472
It's Geist.

41:14.339 --> 41:15.340
Hello?

41:19.577 --> 41:20.749
Really?

41:23.348 --> 41:25.259
So that's it, then?

41:31.956 --> 41:33.526
Everything okay?

41:33.624 --> 41:36.503
No. Everything is not okay.

41:36.761 --> 41:40.208
I told Ava that I would take care of this,

41:40.298 --> 41:45.179
that if Judge Bishop got the case,
I would threaten his family.

41:46.604 --> 41:49.210
All right, then. Sounds like a plan.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.315
Bishop doesn't have a family.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.357
<i>Well, for one thing, she's a genius.</i>

42:04.455 --> 42:05.525
No doubt.

42:05.623 --> 42:07.625
<i>No, I'm kind of serious.</i>

42:07.959 --> 42:09.165
<i>I saw her take her bootie off,</i>

42:09.227 --> 42:13.471
<i>and she was just staring at her hand,
like really thinking about it.</i>

42:14.699 --> 42:16.872
<i>Can you believe
you made something so cute?</i>

42:16.968 --> 42:18.709
I'm starting to see it.

42:19.137 --> 42:22.141
You got to admit, the first couple of hours,
she was kind of funny-looking.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.320
<i>Well, yeah,
we all look pretty funny at that point.</i>

42:24.375 --> 42:25.649
No. Not you.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.255
I bet you were gorgeous from the jump.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.824
<i>I better get her back to bed.</i>

42:32.884 --> 42:34.227
Okay.

42:34.318 --> 42:37.424
<i>You thinking about coming down to
Miami to visit us anytime soon?</i>

42:37.522 --> 42:38.557
Soon as I can.

42:38.656 --> 42:41.193
<i>Well, no pressure, 'cause we're fine.</i>

42:41.659 --> 42:43.195
I know you are.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.164
<i>It'd just be really nice
for you to spend some time with her.</i>

42:47.231 --> 42:48.574
I promise.

42:52.870 --> 42:54.008
Good night, ladies.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.514
<i>Good night, Raylan.</i>

42:57.275 --> 42:59.255
<i>Say good night to Daddy.</i>

43:26.604 --> 43:28.447
I'm sorry to disturb you this late at night,

43:28.539 --> 43:31.452
but I need to have a word with Mr Paxton.
Is he here?

43:31.542 --> 43:32.782
And who may I say is asking?

43:32.877 --> 43:33.981
Boyd Crowder.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.157
You need a casket, Mr Crowder?

43:41.252 --> 43:43.459
Won't we all eventually?

43:43.554 --> 43:45.659
That's an Excelsior.

43:46.390 --> 43:48.063
Top of the line, fit for a king.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.100
Mara, honey, you remember me
telling you all about Boyd Crowder.

43:52.163 --> 43:55.440
Mr Crowder, this is my wife, Mara.

43:56.067 --> 43:57.239
Well, my compliments.

43:57.969 --> 44:00.415
That's all for now, sugar.

44:06.944 --> 44:08.924
- Money.
- Excuse me?

44:09.313 --> 44:11.816
In case you're wondering
what she sees in me.

44:11.916 --> 44:14.487
Though lately
I think her affections are growing.

44:14.585 --> 44:17.691
Well, judging by her accent,
I take it she's not from West Virginia.

44:17.788 --> 44:20.530
After I buried dear Barbara...

44:20.625 --> 44:25.472
Who, by the way, is very comfortable
inside one of those Excelsiors...

44:25.530 --> 44:26.668
I was lonely.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.342
Mara and I found each other online.

44:30.434 --> 44:33.313
She was a doctor in Latvia.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.879
Now she's helping
prepare the bodies for burial.

44:37.775 --> 44:40.483
She is well-read, of good cheer,

44:41.279 --> 44:45.853
and if I have any choice
in how I shuffle off this mortal coil,

44:45.950 --> 44:48.954
I pray it's while I'm banging her from behind.

44:51.122 --> 44:53.693
Well, being in love with a woman,

44:53.791 --> 44:57.739
you must understand
how much I want to be reunited with mine.

44:57.828 --> 45:02.902
I take it you're here because my good friend
Judge Bishop has Ava's case.

45:03.701 --> 45:07.148
You couldn't buy him,
so now you're trying to buy me. How much?

45:07.638 --> 45:09.083
$300,000.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.885
I don't have it on me now,
but I can get it to you in a week's time.

45:14.512 --> 45:16.583
So, we are finally here at last?

45:17.148 --> 45:19.389
It feels almost gratifying.

45:19.483 --> 45:20.518
I beg your pardon.

45:20.585 --> 45:22.997
You, here, on your knees.

45:23.988 --> 45:25.990
Metaphorically speaking.

45:26.857 --> 45:28.837
Like I said, it's almost gratifying.

45:29.727 --> 45:33.334
Bull need to see you beg.

45:40.838 --> 45:43.785
Please, Mr Paxton.

45:47.445 --> 45:49.425
I don't need your money, Mr Crowder.

45:50.414 --> 45:51.893
I got my own.

45:53.918 --> 45:57.263
Did you really think
that I would let a lowlife piece of shit

45:57.355 --> 45:58.698
turn the tables on me?

45:59.223 --> 46:02.204
That's not how it's done in our world.

46:02.260 --> 46:05.070
Now, as a man who's also in love,

46:07.064 --> 46:09.544
I would make you a one-time offer.

46:10.701 --> 46:16.379
I will call Sheriff Mooney.
I will get Judge Bishop to witness.

46:17.908 --> 46:24.291
And you will make a sworn statement saying
that it was you who murdered poor Mr Delroy

46:24.915 --> 46:29.386
and forced Ava to move the remains.

46:30.655 --> 46:32.635
Now, if you can do that,

46:33.391 --> 46:36.133
I'll make the case against her
disappear right away.

46:40.164 --> 46:42.235
This is just as I figured.

46:43.334 --> 46:44.938
It won't happen.

46:45.936 --> 46:51.852
Because we both know you don't love
your white-trash fiancée that much.

47:10.361 --> 47:12.034
I think he bumped his head.

47:12.763 --> 47:14.106
You killed him.

47:14.165 --> 47:15.769
Is that your medical opinion?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.447
Now, normally, I'm not a violent man.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.451
But my back's against the wall.

47:27.712 --> 47:30.625
Now, this situation here's pretty simple.

47:30.948 --> 47:37.388
We could have a double homicide,
or I could pay you what I was gonna pay him

47:38.356 --> 47:41.701
and you can buy a big house
for all your relatives in Latvia.

47:42.960 --> 47:44.064
How much were you gonna pay him?

47:45.563 --> 47:47.133
$100,000.

47:51.969 --> 47:54.313
I'll tell them it was a burglar.

47:54.972 --> 47:57.885
Well, what if I said I don't believe you?

47:57.975 --> 48:02.219
Whatever I say doesn't matter.
You have two choices.

48:02.313 --> 48:05.226
Either you kill me or you leave now.

48:40.851 --> 48:43.889
It's okay, baby. I'll take care of you.
