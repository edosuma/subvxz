01:09.000 --> 01:11.103
You're not gonna shoot the pee stream,
are ya?

01:11.104 --> 01:12.283
I might.

01:12.318 --> 01:14.043
So just keep on going.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.839
I'm ovulating.

01:29.874 --> 01:31.783
Oh my God! I'm ovulating!

01:31.818 --> 01:34.327
Honey! Bev, come here!

01:34.362 --> 01:35.984
Where do I enter from?

01:36.019 --> 01:38.409
Where your mark is.

01:40.037 --> 01:42.772
I'm excited! You're ovulating!

01:42.807 --> 01:46.220
Okay, so then I look at the stick
and I kiss her.

01:46.302 --> 01:47.206
Yeah.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.043
Okay, I'm fine with all that.

01:50.070 --> 01:52.706
But then it says that I "F" her
against the sink.

01:52.749 --> 01:54.233
I just...

01:54.265 --> 01:55.953
I'm not really sure what that means.

01:55.995 --> 01:57.513
Really?

01:58.166 --> 01:59.650
Okay.

01:59.695 --> 02:02.993
That's why we're rehearsing
to work out all this stuff.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.873
- Can you hold my cup?
- Sure.

02:04.907 --> 02:08.502
Okay, so this is what I want you to do.
Can I just be you?

02:08.538 --> 02:11.213
Okay, so, you are going to

02:11.888 --> 02:14.672
look at her and you're gonna take her
and you're gonna

02:14.708 --> 02:17.243
pull her against the sink.
Bam!

02:17.287 --> 02:18.621
And you're gonna

02:18.667 --> 02:21.821
look at her with passion

02:21.856 --> 02:24.270
and then you...
Don't worry, I won't kiss you.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.231
You're gonna take her,
and you're gonna kiss her,

02:27.277 --> 02:28.890
with tongue...

02:29.758 --> 02:31.881
and then I want you to reach down,

02:31.916 --> 02:34.732
and then I want you to finger-fuck her,

02:34.807 --> 02:37.863
and give her the best fucking orgasm ever.

02:37.895 --> 02:39.023
Go for it.

02:39.948 --> 02:42.181
Oh, you mean with my hand.

02:43.307 --> 02:44.771
Yeah.

02:44.807 --> 02:48.491
Unless you have some other apparati
I don't know about.

02:50.615 --> 02:53.451
I'm excited. You're ovulating!

02:53.485 --> 02:55.152
I'm ovulating.

02:55.186 --> 02:57.220
Let's make a baby.

02:58.565 --> 03:02.683
Passion! That's okay.

03:02.726 --> 03:07.082
Wow! It looks like you guys are
in sort doing like a dance.

03:07.106 --> 03:09.892
- You need to see my hand?
- I'd like to.

03:09.927 --> 03:10.872
It might be nice

03:10.876 --> 03:12.832
if you look like you're actually
giving her pleasure,

03:12.838 --> 03:14.641
rather than moving furniture.

03:17.016 --> 03:19.962
You know, that looks,

03:20.518 --> 03:25.591
that looks like
you're sewing up a hole in her jean. Yeah.

03:25.638 --> 03:28.320
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to be doing.

03:28.366 --> 03:29.661
Neither do I.

03:29.696 --> 03:32.590
Step away. Move away from her.

03:32.637 --> 03:35.342
Just step away from each other.
Adele,

03:35.387 --> 03:37.580
can you schedule time

03:37.646 --> 03:40.640
for me and the other actors
that have sex scenes?

03:41.527 --> 03:44.461
You guys really don't know
how to fuck women, do you?

03:46.337 --> 03:48.482
You guys are gonna learn how to fuck.

03:48.528 --> 03:51.760
I'm gonna get a lesbian sex coach
to teach you.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.502
Please.

03:53.548 --> 03:54.772
That would be great.

05:00.525 --> 05:01.983
What can we do for you?

05:02.016 --> 05:02.472
- "Piece of My Love" by Debby Holiday -

05:02.508 --> 05:04.161
I'd love to talk to you two,

05:04.546 --> 05:06.162
if you don't mind.

05:06.217 --> 05:08.163
My girlfriend and I are listening.

05:08.665 --> 05:11.091
Good. Do you wanna...
do you wanna grab a table?

05:11.126 --> 05:12.490
No.

05:17.505 --> 05:19.961
I came here to apologize.

05:20.008 --> 05:22.080
I didn't meant any disrespect.
Not towards you,

05:22.136 --> 05:25.501
or to your relationship. I apologize.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.233
And I'm sorry for the way I treated you
when you came into my house.

05:29.236 --> 05:30.870
I was just a little, uh...

05:30.905 --> 05:32.891
I wasn't me that night.

05:32.926 --> 05:34.532
So I'd like to make peace.

05:35.005 --> 05:36.850
And if there's anything I can do to

05:36.895 --> 05:38.833
even the playing field...

05:42.427 --> 05:45.922
Well, there is just one thing
I can think of.

05:48.587 --> 05:50.801
Jenny Schecter, she's your roomate, right?

05:50.848 --> 05:52.713
My best friend and my roomate, why?

05:53.088 --> 05:54.213
Well,

05:55.547 --> 05:58.190
come closer, I won't bite.

05:59.605 --> 06:04.091
Get her to use SheBar as the location
in her big Hollywood lesbo movie.

06:04.128 --> 06:06.071
- I don't know, Dawn. That's...
- What, what?

06:06.117 --> 06:10.033
Are you too small time, Shane?
Just a little low hairdresser?

06:10.085 --> 06:12.973
If I recall, I never said I was big time
to begin with, did I?

06:13.005 --> 06:14.181
No.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.790
Alright.

06:17.488 --> 06:20.413
I'll ask her. I can't promise you.
But I'll ask her.

06:20.456 --> 06:22.092
You know, you make that happen,

06:22.138 --> 06:24.160
we might be talking dÃ©tente.

06:29.037 --> 06:30.753
- Alright.
- See ya.

06:32.358 --> 06:35.123
Oh, oh, just one more thing.

06:36.628 --> 06:38.823
I knew there would be with you.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.703
It has to be called SheBar in the movie.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.843
Not the Pluto Cafe or

06:43.888 --> 06:46.902
whatever the stupid thing was called
that's supposed to be The Planet.

06:46.937 --> 06:50.193
- What?
- SheBar is such a better location.

06:50.237 --> 06:54.233
I can't believe they were going
to pay $50,000 a day

06:54.278 --> 06:57.051
for that wannabe Peach Pit of a shithole.

06:57.086 --> 06:58.640
You're too much.

07:00.048 --> 07:02.140
- I can't do it.
- What?

07:02.187 --> 07:04.013
What can't you do, Shane?

07:04.056 --> 07:06.380
Other than make my girlfriend come?

07:06.485 --> 07:07.752
I didn't realize that's what you wanted.

07:07.838 --> 07:10.240
- I can't do it.
- Of course that's what we want!

07:10.465 --> 07:12.421
Get to my friend, man!

07:12.467 --> 07:14.240
You have problems with me,
you stay with me.

07:14.276 --> 07:17.250
You don't fuck over my friend! I'm sure
she's not gonna fuck them over for you!

07:17.255 --> 07:18.843
So pointless.

07:18.886 --> 07:22.681
Now, I'm just gonna have to put your friend
out of business the old fashion way.

07:22.725 --> 07:24.412
Is that...
Is that a threat?

07:24.458 --> 07:26.462
Are you still talking?
Are you still here?

07:26.496 --> 07:28.590
Oh, that's another threat.
Dawn!

07:28.626 --> 07:31.163
It is so on! You're fucked.

07:33.106 --> 07:34.282
What?

07:34.328 --> 07:35.352
Call me.

08:03.837 --> 08:05.601
Here is all your stuff.

08:10.598 --> 08:12.653
I'll get the suitcase back to you.

08:17.036 --> 08:19.750
Did you want to come in
and see if I forgot anything?

08:21.485 --> 08:23.290
I trust you.

08:23.326 --> 08:26.031
That's bullshit. You don't trust me.

08:29.706 --> 08:31.450
I trust you.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.490
We're just not good for each other.

08:38.136 --> 08:40.722
I'm really sorry that I

08:40.767 --> 08:42.212
fucked your life up.

08:42.246 --> 08:45.641
I was gay long before
I ever met you.

08:54.086 --> 08:57.771
Anyway, Brown,
he had in it for me. So,

08:57.805 --> 09:00.190
I'm sure he would have found something.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.782
So I heard you got offered some

09:08.827 --> 09:11.911
big talk-show or something?

09:11.955 --> 09:14.771
- What is it? "The Look"?
- No.

09:14.906 --> 09:17.440
They're just interested.
I still have to audition.

09:17.486 --> 09:20.320
They're looking for a replacement
for Kelly Corrigan.

09:20.357 --> 09:22.712
- Wow, that's great.
- I don't know if I'm gonna do it though.

09:22.747 --> 09:26.302
- If I want to be, you know, the replacement dyke.
- Oh, come on.

09:26.346 --> 09:29.192
No, you know,
'cause they want me to be out and

09:29.235 --> 09:31.952
flamboyant and audacious, and...

09:31.998 --> 09:33.970
you know, it's on national television.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.760
I don't know if I want to be gay
for the whole world.

09:36.765 --> 09:38.632
This is why we're not good
for each other.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.192
Why would you think twice
about something like this?

09:41.237 --> 09:43.612
It's like a dream come true for you.

09:43.655 --> 09:45.310
You don't know what I dream of.

09:49.077 --> 09:51.662
You're right. I'm gonna go.

10:02.376 --> 10:04.562
- "Love and Affection"
by Joan Armatrading -

10:16.506 --> 10:19.120
- Can I come in?
- Hey!

10:20.592 --> 10:24.046
Kit and Angie, they're not gonna be back
from Dysneyland for a couple of hours.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.493
I came early.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.806
I hope you don't mind.

10:28.559 --> 10:30.412
No, it's fine.

10:36.517 --> 10:38.723
Are you having a diner party
or something?

10:39.066 --> 10:41.652
No, this is just for Angie.

10:42.037 --> 10:43.993
I wanted to figure before you got here.

10:44.047 --> 10:46.662
Told Kit not to let her eat a lot of crap
from Disneyland.

10:46.698 --> 10:48.212
Oh yeah, right.

10:51.587 --> 10:53.983
It looks fancy.
What are you making?

10:55.256 --> 11:00.503
Oh, it's just fried chicken
and vegetables also.

11:00.545 --> 11:04.393
It smells amazing.

11:11.158 --> 11:14.511
Did Jodi teach you how to cook?
I heard she's a great cooker.

11:14.548 --> 11:15.842
Actually,

11:15.886 --> 11:17.560
no, I taught myself.

11:17.608 --> 11:21.021
I sometimes cook for me and Angie
when we're alone.

11:21.625 --> 11:26.273
It makes me feel like we, you know,
make a family. I enjoy it.

11:29.806 --> 11:32.653
I'll have to cook for you sometime.

11:44.057 --> 11:45.243
Bette...

11:47.575 --> 11:49.232
Turn around...

11:57.866 --> 12:00.640
Look, I know
that you don't want to hurt Jodi...

12:02.656 --> 12:04.282
No, I don't.

12:46.575 --> 12:48.382
Why are we doing this?

12:48.425 --> 12:49.973
Shhh.

13:00.957 --> 13:02.621
Oh, wait.

13:04.048 --> 13:05.533
Don't.

13:20.715 --> 13:22.802
Spread your legs.

13:24.277 --> 13:26.841
Why are you talking dirty to me?

13:45.268 --> 13:47.251
You're so wet.

13:52.557 --> 13:55.411
I just wanna fuck you.

14:00.788 --> 14:04.302
Thank you very much. So Jenny,
we have one more possiblity

14:04.348 --> 14:07.280
for Bev and Nina's house.
It's in Keats.

14:07.316 --> 14:08.910
Where the fuck is she?

14:09.567 --> 14:11.953
Well, I don't really care
that it's a saturday.

14:11.995 --> 14:14.941
Can you tell her that
I'm working on saturday because of her?

14:17.595 --> 14:20.651
Alright. I want you
to give her a message for me, okay?

14:20.685 --> 14:23.833
I want you to tell her
that it's not gonna work.

14:23.868 --> 14:26.191
All right?
Vancouver doesn't pass as L.A.

14:26.235 --> 14:30.871
And I am not gonna shoot here
in this waterlogged, provincial little city.

14:30.915 --> 14:32.781
And it's a complete waste of my time
to come here

14:32.786 --> 14:34.421
when I should have been back in L.A.

14:34.428 --> 14:36.533
prepping for my first day
of shooting on monday.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.040
- Alright?
- Jenny, actually,

14:39.088 --> 14:41.402
there's been lots of shows
that have been shot up here successfully.

14:41.435 --> 14:43.542
So, if you wanna take a look
at the location...

14:43.586 --> 14:45.341
Can you please also tell her

14:45.376 --> 14:48.431
that I don't appreciate her
sending her studio

14:48.468 --> 14:51.771
fucking nark to spy on me
and tell me

14:51.817 --> 14:53.863
that black is white.

14:53.897 --> 14:55.962
Okay? Right.

14:59.478 --> 15:01.913
I hope you know
I have absolutely nothing to gain

15:01.948 --> 15:05.543
- by convincing you to shoot in Vancouver.
- Good. Because I'm not.

15:05.575 --> 15:07.631
And when the studio pulls the plug
on your movie

15:07.637 --> 15:09.203
because you're out of the budget,

15:09.236 --> 15:11.080
I'll have another job tomorrow.

15:15.788 --> 15:18.561
Can you please open up the door? Hey!

15:19.575 --> 15:20.713
I don't...!

15:20.758 --> 15:22.561
I want you to know

15:22.606 --> 15:26.070
that I don't think
you should be in this industry.

15:28.085 --> 15:31.370
I don't think that you know
how to deal with artists.

15:31.377 --> 15:34.183
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny,
Williams just texted you back.

15:34.216 --> 15:35.712
- What?
- Okay, listen.

15:35.747 --> 15:39.463
What is this Vancouver folly?
Of course we're shooting L.A. for L.A.

15:39.497 --> 15:41.933
I just secure the bond financing this place.

15:41.968 --> 15:45.560
Aaron knows. So see you on set
monday morning. XO, XO, William.

15:47.606 --> 15:49.472
That's right, Sally!

15:50.958 --> 15:54.271
I'm so excited! I am so happy.

15:55.237 --> 15:57.443
When did I text him?

15:57.487 --> 15:59.273
I don't remember doing that.

15:59.315 --> 16:01.253
I feel like I'm going crazy.

16:02.137 --> 16:06.571
- When did I text him?
- Listen, I hope you don't mind, but I just,

16:07.427 --> 16:09.222
I took the liberty.

16:09.256 --> 16:12.962
- What do you mean?
- Because I saw how unhappy you were.

16:14.105 --> 16:16.521
And so, I texted him myself.

16:16.555 --> 16:18.673
I think that we need to celebrate.

16:18.705 --> 16:21.843
Okay. Alright.
What do you wanna do?

16:23.835 --> 16:25.942
That's what I wanna do.

16:27.006 --> 16:29.202
And the next thing I'm gonna do

16:29.247 --> 16:31.663
is to take you shopping.

16:31.697 --> 16:35.141
You are so beautiful, okay?
And I can see

16:35.187 --> 16:38.493
that you're hiding behind those glasses.

16:38.536 --> 16:40.452
If I may be so bored, I just...

16:40.496 --> 16:43.002
There's so much to do.
We start shooting on monday

16:43.006 --> 16:45.340
and you have to approve the costume
we've done,

16:45.378 --> 16:47.401
you've got to finish out listing,
there's

16:47.436 --> 16:48.720
- there's a ton of things to do.
- You know what?

16:48.726 --> 16:50.352
I'm gonna take you shopping.

16:57.088 --> 16:58.740
- Sally?
- Jenny.

16:58.786 --> 17:00.542
I have a job for you.

17:01.048 --> 17:04.673
I want you to take us
to a place where

17:04.707 --> 17:07.550
fashionable vancouverists shop

17:07.587 --> 17:10.952
'cause I'm gonna transform
my lovely assistant.

17:12.817 --> 17:14.452
<i>Joyce's here to see you.</i>

17:14.458 --> 17:16.422
Send her in, please.

17:22.484 --> 17:24.173
Hello, Phyllis.

17:24.218 --> 17:25.530
Joyce,

17:25.595 --> 17:27.583
I know it's presemptious of me
to call you.

17:27.627 --> 17:29.940
And I'm not really expecting
too much sympathy.

17:29.978 --> 17:31.663
I was just wandering...

17:32.078 --> 17:35.140
Maybe you could give me some advice,
make a recommandation...

17:35.188 --> 17:37.600
I think we hit back with a countersuit.

17:38.505 --> 17:42.291
Leonard needs to know that you're not
just gonna roll over and gift him

17:42.337 --> 17:44.751
with everything you've worked so hard for
all these years.

17:46.547 --> 17:49.433
I mean, he's got balls,
I give him that.

17:49.465 --> 17:52.123
And his attorney Joey Manhohand,
he's no slouch either.

17:52.167 --> 17:55.343
So, luckily for you,
I've got a trick or two in my own.

17:56.265 --> 17:59.821
- You wanna represent me?
- Phyllis, you hired me to represent you,

17:59.865 --> 18:02.413
and then you fired me
so we could make sweet love.

18:02.468 --> 18:04.482
And then you broke my heart.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.491
So, the way I see it, you're down a lawyer;
I'm down a job.

18:07.526 --> 18:10.671
Joyce, I didn't actually expect you
to represent me.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.451
I was hoping for a recommandation,
for somebody else...

18:13.485 --> 18:15.471
Phyllis, I'm the best in the business.

18:15.517 --> 18:18.303
I win cases.
It's what I do.

18:18.345 --> 18:21.023
And I got a bum deal here.
So I'm not gonna walk away from

18:21.067 --> 18:24.983
a sweet piece of business just because
we didn't work out as lovers.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.563
In fact,

18:26.605 --> 18:29.003
I think you kinda owe me this one.

18:33.026 --> 18:35.210
- "Pull Shapes" by The Pipettes -

19:02.066 --> 19:04.011
Can I help you to find something?

19:05.836 --> 19:10.732
Yeah, you know, I was wondering if
you had anything any lower pricely dress.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.701
Oh, what price do you have in mind?

19:12.748 --> 19:15.601
- 25, 30...
- Excuse me?

19:16.618 --> 19:18.042
- She's kidding.
- Hello.

19:18.078 --> 19:21.572
Hello. Adele, this is Emile,
a personal shopper here.

19:21.615 --> 19:23.442
This is Adele, my assistant.

19:23.775 --> 19:25.221
- Emile?
- It's alright?

19:25.308 --> 19:26.942
Yes. Please start ???

19:26.945 --> 19:29.612
And you, come here,
I wanna show you some Chanel.

19:33.268 --> 19:35.471
I don't know. Do you like it?

19:35.505 --> 19:38.063
Yeah. But what about,
what about the fancy shoes?

19:38.108 --> 19:40.631
You could wear the shoes on your first day.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.842
- It's so expensive.
- Adele,

19:47.878 --> 19:52.120
really. The thing is we're making a film
about fashionable lesbians,

19:52.156 --> 19:55.050
you know,
so we have to be fashionable and

19:55.568 --> 19:57.661
we were here doing research?

19:59.095 --> 20:01.803
Wait, this is coming out of
the wardrobe budget?

20:01.847 --> 20:03.241
Shh...

20:03.287 --> 20:06.420
We should get you some jeans now, because,

20:06.465 --> 20:08.353
um, Adele,

20:09.215 --> 20:12.381
the appliquÃ© on the back of your jeans

20:12.418 --> 20:16.730
was declared an abomination
by the Geneva Convention.

20:16.778 --> 20:19.701
We've got to burn them
after we buy new ones!

20:44.838 --> 20:47.360
- Look.
- Oh wow!

20:47.406 --> 20:50.010
Well, it's, it's David Yourman,

20:50.097 --> 20:55.040
and maybe you're getting a bit
carried away here. This is quite expensive.

20:56.556 --> 21:00.452
Oh, no, no, not for me.
It's for Niki.

21:00.498 --> 21:04.042
You know, just a little, a little gift 
to the start of the production. 

21:09.428 --> 21:11.822
Okay, we'll take it.

21:13.556 --> 21:15.611
- You know, Adele...
- Yeah?

21:15.646 --> 21:18.080
...you are the only one
that knows about Niki and me.

21:18.176 --> 21:21.023
I know, I know.
And discretion is imperative.

21:21.068 --> 21:24.761
The only reason I told you
is that so you can protect us.

21:24.806 --> 21:27.173
I'll make sure
that nobody has the slightest inkling.

21:27.217 --> 21:28.993
Oh yeah. I mean, the thing is,

21:29.027 --> 21:30.703
if the other actors knew,

21:30.746 --> 21:33.242
that would just cause so much drama,

21:33.275 --> 21:35.632
so much jealousy on set, you know?

21:35.646 --> 21:36.563
I know.

21:37.556 --> 21:40.730
I mean, everyone always
falls in love with the director.

21:58.438 --> 22:01.572
Oh my God! You look beautiful.

22:01.606 --> 22:04.060
- Thanks.
- Do you like it?

22:04.107 --> 22:08.060
I love it. Thank you.
I love it. I love it. I love it!

22:09.138 --> 22:10.861
You know what?

22:10.876 --> 22:14.240
I think we're gonna wait
'til we get back to L.A. to do your hair.

22:14.288 --> 22:16.822
I think only Shane
should be touching your hair.

23:27.608 --> 23:29.450
Good morning, sweet pea.

23:29.505 --> 23:32.143
Are you hungry?
Do we make pancakes?

23:32.238 --> 23:34.292
Let me go check
and see what we have. Okay?

23:34.298 --> 23:35.932
I'll go look.

23:40.797 --> 23:42.913
Oh oh... We're out of milk.

23:46.546 --> 23:47.753
I know what we should do.

23:49.146 --> 23:52.561
What if we call mama B

23:52.597 --> 23:54.903
to see if she wants
to have breakfeast with us.

23:54.945 --> 23:56.971
That looks like a good idea?

23:57.426 --> 23:58.920
What do you think?

23:59.646 --> 24:02.523
Yeah? Let's call mama B?

24:02.528 --> 24:03.952
Do you wanna come sit with me?

24:04.527 --> 24:07.913
Let's call mama B and see if she wants
to go to the Planet and have pancakes.

24:07.916 --> 24:09.552
Do you want some pancakes?

24:11.536 --> 24:14.522
I would love to have breakfeast
with you and Angie, but um...

24:20.997 --> 24:23.901
- Yeah, right, of course.
- Tina, wait...

24:25.087 --> 24:28.063
I think we're gonna have to pass
on breakfeast.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.483
Yeah, it's a really sweet idea.

24:32.488 --> 24:34.820
But, yeah. Give Angie a kiss for me.

24:37.828 --> 24:40.061
Don't you wanna go out for breakfeast?

24:40.126 --> 24:42.241
I'm kind in the mood to go out.

24:42.288 --> 24:44.490
If you are in the mood to go out...
You know what?

24:44.508 --> 24:45.920
I would really just

24:45.965 --> 24:48.453
like to sit in my garden

24:48.495 --> 24:50.383
and read the newspaper.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.710
But if you want to go to The Planet

24:53.745 --> 24:56.450
and do another podcast,
then that would be great.

24:57.518 --> 25:00.072
I said I was just joking.

25:00.105 --> 25:02.273
And I said I was sorry, too.

25:03.148 --> 25:05.872
Are you gonna go on punishing me forever?

25:08.028 --> 25:09.561
I'm sorry.

25:10.267 --> 25:11.650
I'm just...

25:13.356 --> 25:14.832
I'm just stressed.

25:20.526 --> 25:23.102
Do you wanna go see some art?

25:23.985 --> 25:26.630
It can help you to relax.

25:28.385 --> 25:31.042
Or maybe we could go to the beach.

25:31.535 --> 25:33.983
Towards up the coast, to Suma.

25:40.296 --> 25:42.460
I think I just

25:43.295 --> 25:46.591
I just need a little
sunday alone time, that's all.

25:46.607 --> 25:49.311
Just to get ready for the week.
I mean, apart from everything else,

25:49.355 --> 25:51.701
I have to appear before the Board
and tell them

25:51.745 --> 25:54.402
what I'm gonna do about
what Justin's done with

25:54.445 --> 25:56.493
- the gun on his head.
- What are you going to tell them?

26:00.785 --> 26:02.272
I really don't know.

26:30.595 --> 26:33.910
I'm so glad you guys met me here.
I was feeling really lonely.

26:33.955 --> 26:35.810
Oh my God!
That's why you called Shane!

26:35.848 --> 26:38.320
Well, ladies, that's what friends
are for. What can I say?

26:38.356 --> 26:40.173
But we're still going
to Phyllis' house tonight, right?

26:40.208 --> 26:42.553
- Yeah.
- Is uh, Bette gonna be there?

26:44.228 --> 26:46.960
I thought you guys
were getting along lately.

26:46.995 --> 26:50.170
Yeah, yeah. It's not a problem.
Is Tasha coming?

26:50.206 --> 26:52.040
It's over, Tina!

26:52.088 --> 26:54.710
Do I look like I wanna talk about it?

26:55.446 --> 26:57.660
Come on, this is crazy.
You two are so in love.

26:57.706 --> 26:59.421
It doesn't always matter.

26:59.468 --> 27:01.853
I know, but can't you just talk to her or...

27:02.765 --> 27:05.021
Didn't I say
I don't wanna talk about it?

27:06.355 --> 27:07.390
Yep?

27:07.427 --> 27:09.280
You still wanna meet at the Planet?

27:09.327 --> 27:10.761
<i>I'm here already.</i>

27:10.795 --> 27:13.453
With Alice and Shane.

27:15.776 --> 27:17.251
Well I really...

27:17.885 --> 27:19.733
I really wanna see you, Tina.

27:19.778 --> 27:21.922
Well, I can't right now.

27:24.035 --> 27:26.722
Well, what about tonight?
I don't, I don't have any plans.

27:26.756 --> 27:29.920
I'm actually going to
your boss' house.

27:35.036 --> 27:37.520
Puppy! Puppy!

27:37.557 --> 27:40.501
- Bette, I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Those are freaking puppies!

27:42.558 --> 27:45.062
But I don't have rats.

27:45.095 --> 27:50.053
It's impossible. I have
the cleanest establishment this side...

27:51.545 --> 27:54.051
"Until further notice". Come on!

27:54.817 --> 27:58.663
I haven't seen that many creatures
since we shut down "Bowie's Pizza".

27:59.698 --> 28:02.420
What we're asking for
is to clear all that, M'am.

28:03.248 --> 28:07.522
Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Shit!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

28:10.337 --> 28:12.382
How did this fucking happen?

28:12.425 --> 28:13.883
I have a theory.

28:55.428 --> 28:58.480
- "Leader of the Pack"
by The Shangri-Las -

29:19.508 --> 29:21.260
What a party, huh?

29:25.867 --> 29:27.913
I thought you were doing anything tonight.

29:27.925 --> 29:28.952
I wasn't.

29:31.138 --> 29:33.193
Where is Jodi? Is she here?

29:34.158 --> 29:36.652
No. She didn't want to do

29:36.688 --> 29:39.132
a work thing,
and Phyllis is work for us.

29:39.168 --> 29:40.090
Right.

29:44.838 --> 29:46.253
Do you want to get out of here?

30:09.448 --> 30:10.780
You gonna dance in your black bra?

30:10.827 --> 30:12.493
You know I was thinking about it,

30:12.535 --> 30:15.293
but I just don't need one.
Thank God.

30:16.577 --> 30:18.521
- Where is Tina?
- I don't know.

30:18.565 --> 30:21.391
- Maybe she scored. I don't...
- You think?

30:26.565 --> 30:28.243
It's getting good, huh?

30:32.896 --> 30:33.951
What?

30:38.085 --> 30:40.492
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

30:45.006 --> 30:46.843
She's cute.

30:48.295 --> 30:49.631
Mother!

31:10.056 --> 31:11.722
I can't stay too long.

31:11.755 --> 31:13.613
I have to be on set
at 7 o'clock in the morning.

31:13.658 --> 31:14.691
Yeah, I know.

31:16.288 --> 31:17.933
So this thing is

31:17.968 --> 31:21.592
really going through. I mean,
Jenny's gonna be directing the movie?

31:21.628 --> 31:23.440
Apparently.

31:35.777 --> 31:37.581
I don't know what to do.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.432
You're in love with Jodi, right?

31:47.085 --> 31:48.923
I adore her.

31:48.965 --> 31:52.332
And I respect and admire her. But...

31:52.937 --> 31:54.330
But what?

31:55.306 --> 31:57.191
It doesn't really compare.

32:03.186 --> 32:05.530
- "Honey Honey" by Feist -

33:27.045 --> 33:28.371
I missed you.

35:00.535 --> 35:02.163
I'm gonna go now.

35:18.098 --> 35:20.023
I love you.

35:20.555 --> 35:23.660
Jodi would be so devastated.

35:25.326 --> 35:27.142
She can't find out.

35:27.247 --> 35:29.222
Well, I'm certainly not gonna tell her.

35:31.076 --> 35:32.583
I'm sorry, I just...

35:34.035 --> 35:36.761
I just need more time. That's all.

35:40.008 --> 35:42.190
I'm not pushing you.

35:42.235 --> 35:44.611
I don't even know what I want.

35:44.676 --> 35:45.873
I know, I...

35:47.145 --> 35:48.840
I just think

35:48.848 --> 35:51.952
we both need to take the time to just

35:52.145 --> 35:54.293
figure out what we want.

35:54.338 --> 35:55.842
That's all.

35:55.886 --> 35:58.260
You know, what's right for us,
how to do the right thing.

35:58.308 --> 36:00.510
I think we just need to take the time.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.642
And you need to figure out

36:04.687 --> 36:06.431
what's right for you.

36:07.297 --> 36:10.200
And I need to figure out
what's right for me.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.663
Right.

36:58.006 --> 37:00.502
Wow, Adele, can you believe this?

37:00.548 --> 37:03.792
All of this because of a few little words
that I put on a page.

37:03.798 --> 37:05.942
I know, and now you're just gonna

37:05.985 --> 37:08.613
pouring it to life
before our very eyes.

37:10.648 --> 37:12.451
Do you want me to take you to your room?

37:12.496 --> 37:14.942
I would like to go to my trailer, Sir.

37:16.097 --> 37:18.670
Uh, that's your room.

37:18.705 --> 37:20.823
- Your trailer.
- Sir,

37:20.855 --> 37:22.481
please stop here.

37:22.526 --> 37:27.092
I'm going to get out
and walk along the street of my dreams.

37:27.095 --> 37:28.740
I'm so excited!

37:28.776 --> 37:30.773
- Okay, let's go. Here.
- My purse.

37:32.066 --> 37:33.180
Thank you.

37:33.218 --> 37:34.460
You're ready?

37:35.145 --> 37:37.582
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

37:38.506 --> 37:39.810
Here we go.

37:42.435 --> 37:43.841
So,

37:43.886 --> 37:47.142
the catering truck is back at base camp,

37:47.175 --> 37:48.812
to get you some breakfeast.

37:48.857 --> 37:51.523
But if you want craft services,
you see the house right there?

37:52.387 --> 37:54.593
- It's in the garage.
- Okay.

37:54.627 --> 37:57.191
Oh, that's the camera truck
right there.

37:57.236 --> 37:59.632
Right. That's were you can find 
Sam the DP,

37:59.686 --> 38:02.872
- inbetween ???
- Wow! Okay. How do you know all this stuff?

38:02.906 --> 38:05.882
You have never been
on a film set before.

38:05.926 --> 38:08.271
I know. That's why I came here
first thing this morning

38:08.356 --> 38:10.172
when they were loading it 
just to make sure I knew

38:10.215 --> 38:12.191
- what everything is for you.
- Oh my gosh!

38:12.235 --> 38:15.141
Hey, are you girls looking
for extras holding? Try there.

38:20.527 --> 38:22.323
- Excuse me.
- That is Jennifer Schecter.

38:22.355 --> 38:25.570
- I'm Jennifer Schecter.
- The director.

38:26.966 --> 38:30.322
- Sorry!
- It's alright! No problem.

38:37.207 --> 38:38.853
- Get his name.
- I did.

38:38.937 --> 38:40.960
- Thanks.
- Clock himself at 20.

38:41.418 --> 38:43.120
I'm glad you both are here.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.543
I wanted to talk to you.

38:44.566 --> 38:46.311
Well, I wanted Jodi to have a say
in the matter

38:46.358 --> 38:47.762
before you and I went to the Board.

38:47.855 --> 38:49.311
It's about my daughter, Molly.

38:49.346 --> 38:51.280
I don't think you've mattered yet, Bette.

38:51.327 --> 38:54.773
And you didn't even go
to the party last night, missy.

38:54.807 --> 38:56.461
I was working.

38:56.498 --> 38:59.171
My daughter arrived
at the most inopportune time.

38:59.208 --> 39:01.600
I was having fun. It was harmless.

39:01.638 --> 39:03.242
Now she thinks I'm

39:03.277 --> 39:06.723
turning into a promiscuous,
debauched lesbian.

39:06.755 --> 39:08.921
And what can we do to help you, Phyllis?

39:08.957 --> 39:11.103
I need you to help me convince Molly

39:11.597 --> 39:13.621
that lesbians can be

39:13.656 --> 39:16.513
respectable and upstanding and stable.

39:16.548 --> 39:19.252
All the values her father and I
instil in her.

39:19.888 --> 39:20.920
How?

39:21.017 --> 39:23.730
Just let her spend some time
with the two of you together.

39:23.766 --> 39:25.610
I want her to see two women
that have a

39:25.647 --> 39:27.822
stable, honest and loving relationship.

39:28.465 --> 39:30.553
By the way, we have to do something
about this boy

39:30.555 --> 39:32.452
who tried to shoot himself
in the head.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.490
- No, no, no. He didn't shoot himself in the head.
- What? No, no, no.

39:34.536 --> 39:36.833
He did not shoot himself.

39:36.868 --> 39:38.931
- You propose?
- I propose that

39:38.976 --> 39:41.030
we have a press conference,
I'll make a statement,

39:41.076 --> 39:43.692
and Jodi can do some form
of mea culpa.

39:43.738 --> 39:45.232
I don't think it's gonna work.

39:45.275 --> 39:47.182
The Board is out for blood.

39:47.225 --> 39:49.281
<i>Molly's here to see you.</i>

39:49.737 --> 39:51.053
Please send her in.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.583
Sorry, I didn't realize...

39:57.628 --> 40:00.010
Come on in, Molly.
We're almost finished.

40:00.778 --> 40:02.092
Come on, sit down.

40:06.836 --> 40:09.590
This is Bette Porter,
the Dean of our School of the Arts.

40:09.636 --> 40:12.142
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- And her partner, Jodi Lerner.

40:12.188 --> 40:14.031
She teaches in the sculpture department.

40:14.077 --> 40:17.322
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is Tom Mater, Jodi's interpretor.

40:20.075 --> 40:21.882
They're lesbians.

40:24.886 --> 40:26.450
I'm resigning.

40:26.497 --> 40:28.320
What?

40:28.355 --> 40:31.021
Justin's piece was

40:31.065 --> 40:34.841
one of the best student work I have
ever seen and I totally stand behind it.

40:34.886 --> 40:37.710
But I know that if Bette had known
about it in advance,

40:37.766 --> 40:40.330
- she never would have let me go ahead with it.
- That is absolutely not true.

40:40.366 --> 40:43.572
- I do not want you to resign.
- Well, neither do I.

40:44.357 --> 40:46.423
I love teaching here. I love my class.

40:46.456 --> 40:49.580
But it sucks that your job is jeopardized
because of something

40:49.617 --> 40:52.830
that I'm totally responsible for.
So, I can't live with that.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.472
I'm resigning.

40:54.506 --> 40:56.530
But remember, I have my work.

40:56.575 --> 40:58.411
And, most importantly, I have you.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.033
So I'll be fine.

41:03.516 --> 41:06.760
- How far behind are we?
- Oh, only an hour and a half.

41:07.455 --> 41:09.762
- Jesus!
- Has Niki stepped down?

41:10.797 --> 41:12.601
Oh great, here she comes.

41:18.075 --> 41:21.061
I'm so excited.
This is the first shot of the film.

41:21.106 --> 41:23.913
Okay, so what you're gonna do is
you gonna walk up here,

41:23.956 --> 41:26.493
you're gonna be sniffing the rosemary.

41:26.536 --> 41:27.813
Where is the uh...

41:27.847 --> 41:30.022
the prop person with the,

41:30.067 --> 41:31.881
the sprig?

41:31.956 --> 41:34.542
Okay, so you're gonna be sniffing this.

41:34.577 --> 41:37.793
Yeah, I don't know why I'll be holding that.
I mean, it's stupid.

41:38.348 --> 41:42.020
Because Tina gave it to you out back,
by the pool

41:42.066 --> 41:43.990
- and we just rehearsed it so...
- Yeah, I know, but

41:44.036 --> 41:47.402
who walks around with a plant for no reason?
I mean, why would I still be caring it around?

41:47.438 --> 41:49.462
Jenny, we got to go. We're out of time.

41:52.107 --> 41:54.190
Fuck the rosemary.
That's cool.

41:54.237 --> 41:56.280
Okay, here we go.
Lets' walk it up, please.

41:56.327 --> 41:59.251
- And, roll sound, please.
- Can I have a...?

42:01.227 --> 42:02.641
Okay, sorry.

42:05.258 --> 42:06.682
Thanks.

42:16.778 --> 42:18.491
- Action.
- Oh, right.

42:19.455 --> 42:21.063
Action!

42:21.108 --> 42:25.750
Yeah, well, I don't wanna write about
being a student anymore you know? 

42:26.736 --> 42:28.963
I've done that a part of my life.

42:29.048 --> 42:31.240
You might change your mind
when you get older.

42:31.376 --> 42:33.980
Actually, I'm thinking about going back
to school to start a new carreer.

42:34.025 --> 42:35.822
Oh, you should do it.

42:35.868 --> 42:37.880
Maybe in a couple of years.

42:37.918 --> 42:39.933
Right now, I'm trying to get pregnant.

42:39.967 --> 42:43.151
Oh my God, that's so great!

42:43.187 --> 42:45.440
Hey! Cut, cut!

42:45.488 --> 42:47.312
- Let's cut!
- Sorry. Can I...?

42:47.358 --> 42:50.940
Where is the continuity...
That's not the line, okay?

42:50.978 --> 42:55.982
The scripted line is "Jim said
that you and Bev were a couple".

42:56.016 --> 42:58.223
So you're confused to how
she could have a baby

42:58.248 --> 43:01.301
- 'cause she's a lesbian.
- Well, that's retarted.

43:01.308 --> 43:04.560
I mean, everybody knows that lezzies
are having babies all over the place, Jenny.

43:04.598 --> 43:08.440
Right. But the character in

43:08.487 --> 43:12.070
my script has just arrived to L.A.

43:12.078 --> 43:14.870
She's from the Midwest, she's naive.

43:14.915 --> 43:18.790
- She's never met a lesbian before...
- She's never met a lesbian before?

43:18.796 --> 43:21.631
What about Ellen and Portia?
I mean does she not have a TV?

43:21.676 --> 43:23.770
Hey, how about you say

43:23.808 --> 43:25.250
the scripted line?

43:29.787 --> 43:31.532
Oh come on!

43:32.007 --> 43:35.930
No, no, no, don't get... don't get upset.
Just... She's alright.

43:35.965 --> 43:37.040
What?

43:37.088 --> 43:38.750
You wanna go take care of it?

43:54.198 --> 43:56.140
What's going on?

44:06.745 --> 44:09.100
We hooked up the other night, Jenny.

44:09.148 --> 44:10.582
I know.

44:11.068 --> 44:13.672
Now you're just treating me
like some random actor,

44:13.718 --> 44:15.630
- like you don't even know me.
- No!

44:15.676 --> 44:17.623
I thought that it was really...

44:17.666 --> 44:20.262
I thought that it was really amazing.

44:20.307 --> 44:23.251
Did you, did you get the necklace
that I gave you?

44:23.295 --> 44:25.703
I don't care about some lame-ass necklace.

44:25.745 --> 44:28.202
I mean, you didn't even come in
to see me this morning.

44:28.246 --> 44:31.772
- It's like you don't care about me at all!
- No, that's not true.

44:32.377 --> 44:33.930
I didn't come in to see you this morning

44:33.968 --> 44:36.682
because I don't want
all these fucking dimwit actors

44:36.686 --> 44:38.352
gossiping about you.

44:38.407 --> 44:40.783
Or gossiping about me.

44:40.815 --> 44:43.981
Do you know what I wanted to do
when you walked down the set today?

44:46.777 --> 44:48.780
I really wanted to kiss you.

44:51.607 --> 44:52.841
Really?

44:52.877 --> 44:53.982
Yeah.

45:01.576 --> 45:05.330
Oh, you're still mad.

45:12.036 --> 45:15.580
Oh! I thought that you were angry!

45:16.376 --> 45:18.420
What?

45:18.467 --> 45:20.250
Come here.

45:20.295 --> 45:21.483
What?!

45:37.058 --> 45:38.750
I wanna fuck you.

45:39.335 --> 45:41.073
Then do, fuck me.

45:42.007 --> 45:44.943
<i>Oh my God!
I wanna fuck you.</i>

45:44.947 --> 45:48.773
<i>Oh wow! I fuck you so.</i>

45:52.117 --> 45:54.591
<i>- Are you wet?
- Oh my God!</i>

45:54.635 --> 45:55.732
Hey, hey,

45:57.055 --> 45:58.930
you might wanna check this out.

46:06.087 --> 46:08.913
<i>Oh my God! Fuck you!</i>

46:11.448 --> 46:13.670
<i>Don't come yet, don't come yet.</i>

46:13.718 --> 46:15.961
What the fuck?!

46:18.575 --> 46:20.340
- Mister Kornbluth.
- What?!

46:20.388 --> 46:23.472
- Mister Halsey just arrived at base camp.
- Oh, that's great.

46:23.516 --> 46:24.812
William's here.

46:24.856 --> 46:28.160
I can't wait for him to hear what's happening
on the set of his little lesbian movie.

46:32.058 --> 46:34.161
Here you go, Mister Halsey,
an egg white

46:34.225 --> 46:36.650
with white asparagus omelette
just for you.

46:36.688 --> 46:38.472
Oh this is so great.

46:38.517 --> 46:39.992
Look at that.

46:40.036 --> 46:43.590
That is the prettiest omelette
that I've ever seen.

46:44.317 --> 46:45.970
Mister Halsey,

46:46.348 --> 46:47.820
- hi.
- Hey!

46:47.865 --> 46:50.431
I'm Adele Channing,
Jennifer Schecter's assistant.

46:50.445 --> 46:51.893
Would you like an omelette, Adele?

46:51.935 --> 46:54.460
They're making them with the yolk
or without.

46:54.496 --> 46:57.272
Oh, no, thank you. Thank you,
but, no thank you.

46:57.716 --> 46:59.700
I just uh... Jennifer wanted me
to find you

46:59.786 --> 47:01.413
to let you know that there's been a little

47:01.455 --> 47:03.523
problem with Niki this morning.

47:03.568 --> 47:04.820
Really?

47:04.857 --> 47:07.621
Well, let's discuss what's wrong.

47:09.265 --> 47:13.131
The thing is, Mister Halsey,
I think, I think you should know that

47:14.556 --> 47:17.833
Jennifer and Niki are
kind of involved with one another.

47:17.875 --> 47:20.360
What do you mean?
Romantically involved?

47:20.395 --> 47:22.763
Um... yes, yes.

47:22.797 --> 47:24.670
So the

47:24.718 --> 47:26.843
director of the picture

47:26.885 --> 47:28.141
is sleeping

47:28.145 --> 47:30.342
with the star.
Is that what you're saying?

47:30.378 --> 47:31.840
Um yes.

47:33.106 --> 47:35.121
And it's not always a bad thing.

47:36.035 --> 47:37.852
- No?
- No.

47:37.885 --> 47:39.523
How is it not a bad thing?

47:39.567 --> 47:41.573
You know, in the case of...

47:44.008 --> 47:46.211
in the case of Niki...

47:48.085 --> 47:50.573
She's just so young and so fresh and green.

47:50.616 --> 47:52.953
- Oh, really?
- Well, she is! And

47:52.955 --> 47:55.203
I gotta tell you. She was just

47:55.236 --> 47:57.333
really nervous about this role.

47:57.977 --> 48:01.840
And thing is Jennifer knew
how much you wanted,

48:01.888 --> 48:04.040
how much you needed Niki
for this role.

48:04.075 --> 48:06.453
And when she sensed

48:06.488 --> 48:08.382
that Niki was about to drop out,

48:08.985 --> 48:11.143
well, she made her her lover.

48:11.775 --> 48:13.730
Everything changed after that.

48:15.918 --> 48:17.703
Well, that's interesting.

48:17.746 --> 48:20.132
That's a very interesting approach, Adele.

48:20.228 --> 48:22.603
Yes, I think that it saved the movie.

48:23.537 --> 48:26.333
Well, I'm gonna have
to really think about that.

48:28.047 --> 48:29.991
Read your contract, Schecter!

48:30.028 --> 48:33.371
I can replace you,
with or without cause.

48:33.418 --> 48:35.621
Calm down, Aaron. Is that your position?

48:35.666 --> 48:37.493
No, it's not my position, Jenny.
I just,

48:37.537 --> 48:41.802
I think it could be difficult for production,
but no, it's nobody's business, really.

48:42.917 --> 48:44.543
I don't know what you've heard,

48:44.587 --> 48:48.682
but I have never, in all my days
being in show business

48:48.726 --> 48:51.540
- had to put up...
- Wow! There she is!

48:51.585 --> 48:55.022
- I missed you!
- Come and give your daddy a hug!

48:55.095 --> 48:56.800
He's been so mean to me!

48:56.805 --> 49:00.053
Mean?
Don't you be mean to my baby!

49:02.477 --> 49:04.831
- That's the watch!
- I'm wearying it.

49:04.878 --> 49:06.932
- That's the watch I got for you!
- I love it.

49:07.006 --> 49:07.993
Yeah.

49:08.037 --> 49:11.190
Oh, you are really something else.

49:11.238 --> 49:13.761
That little Niki Stevens.

49:13.796 --> 49:15.761
Her movie hasn't even opened yet,

49:15.795 --> 49:18.761
and already she's out of control.

49:18.807 --> 49:20.551
Well, she's a bit fragile.

49:20.598 --> 49:24.313
Well, if there's anyone
who can take a fragile person

49:25.067 --> 49:27.370
and glue them back together,

49:28.327 --> 49:30.060
I think that would be you.

49:30.108 --> 49:33.872
Now, didn't we make
an excellent decision?!

49:38.296 --> 49:40.242
Fuck her, right?
I don't even miss her.

49:40.316 --> 49:41.382
Yeah.

49:41.416 --> 49:42.750
I know you don't.

49:42.786 --> 49:45.363
- Okay, Alice, you're ready?
- Yeah, I just...

49:45.408 --> 49:47.743
- My eyes are tearing for the mascara.
- Just a second.

49:48.928 --> 49:50.283
Allergic to it sometimes.

49:50.315 --> 49:51.703
- Take a deep breath.
- Yeah.

49:52.545 --> 49:53.872
Great. Okay.

49:53.918 --> 49:55.370
- You're cool?
- Totally.

49:55.418 --> 49:56.502
- Right.
- Right.

49:56.536 --> 49:57.863
Rolling.

49:59.455 --> 50:02.490
Hi, I'm Alice in Lesboland,
and we're here, um,

50:02.536 --> 50:05.532
on location. It's a very special day.
We're here

50:05.565 --> 50:07.760
on the set of Jenny Schecter's new film,

50:07.797 --> 50:09.102
"Lez Girls".

50:09.145 --> 50:12.812
It's about the lives and the loves
of lesbians in Los Angeles.

50:12.847 --> 50:15.850
And we're gonna meet
the star of the movie, Niki Stevens,

50:15.896 --> 50:17.310
and uh...

50:17.356 --> 50:19.440
that's it! That's the girly action!

50:21.926 --> 50:24.213
- Okay. Good?
- Yeah.

50:25.358 --> 50:26.813
- I'm alright. Yeah.
- You're okay?

50:26.845 --> 50:28.203
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

50:32.038 --> 50:34.002
We've got a problem
with some of the neighbours.

50:34.046 --> 50:35.170
What kind of problem?

50:35.206 --> 50:38.300
There's a group of neighbourhood folks
over there threatening to shut down the film.

50:38.346 --> 50:40.670
They say they don't want their neighbourhood
trade as a

50:40.707 --> 50:44.151
hotbed of lesbian sex and salaciousness.

50:44.186 --> 50:45.760
We have a permit.

50:45.796 --> 50:47.700
Well, I'll go handle it.

50:48.575 --> 50:50.390
But they say no one told them.

50:57.017 --> 50:59.440
None of us won't be
associated with this film, okay?

50:59.487 --> 51:01.873
It's unrealistic, it exploites.

51:01.905 --> 51:03.092
Frankly we're angry a hell

51:03.095 --> 51:05.381
lesbians are portrayed
in so promiscuous sex scenes.

51:05.417 --> 51:07.430
Listen ladies, I don't know

51:07.466 --> 51:10.272
where any of you got your information from,

51:10.305 --> 51:12.272
but I just wanna tell you guys...

51:12.307 --> 51:14.910
Jenny, that's Dawn Denbo,
she was at your party last week.

51:14.947 --> 51:17.613
- She lives in this neighbourhood?
- I don't know. And I doubt it.

51:17.647 --> 51:19.160
- She doesn't live here.
- Where do you live?

51:19.165 --> 51:21.620
She doesn't even live in this neighbourhood.
She doesn't.

51:21.667 --> 51:23.811
- This is a personnal problem.
- That doesn't matter.

51:23.857 --> 51:26.451
We have friends who live
in this neighbourhood. It doesn't matter.

51:26.498 --> 51:28.772
That's right. You know what?
Let me tell you something.

51:28.815 --> 51:31.120
- Have you even read the script?
- Yes, I've read the script.

51:31.155 --> 51:33.353
- You have?
- I've read some scenes and it sucked.

51:33.395 --> 51:36.222
I auditionned for Dona,
I gave her my sides.

51:36.257 --> 51:39.153
So, how much do you think they want for it?
25,000 piece will do it?

51:39.186 --> 51:40.180
No!

51:40.216 --> 51:42.620
Who is this ? Your daddy Warbucks ? 
What's up with this?

51:42.656 --> 51:45.640
No, no, no. We don't... We're not interested
in your money. Okay?

51:45.678 --> 51:47.882
No, it's a principle, I think.
No, we're not interested in that. No.

51:47.888 --> 51:49.333
We'll take it.

51:49.367 --> 51:50.281
Yeah.

51:50.876 --> 51:54.713
Yeah. Ladies, if you follow,
I'll get you some checks.

51:54.746 --> 51:55.893
Okay, you know what? Fine.
That's right.

51:55.895 --> 51:58.383
With that 25,000 dollars
out of your pockets, fine, you know.

51:58.417 --> 52:00.133
And you'll have to pay a lot more
before it's over.

52:00.378 --> 52:02.943
- I've got two of those for you.
- Fuck you Dembo.

52:02.988 --> 52:06.251
And your dumb lover!
You're a rat fuck!

52:06.296 --> 52:07.631
Bye, Cindi!

52:07.677 --> 52:10.293
Don't talk to my girlfriend, Shane.

52:10.338 --> 52:13.320
- Adele, I like your new makeover.
- Thanks.

52:13.358 --> 52:15.732
Then, I like
those new jeans as well.

52:15.776 --> 52:17.373
What, these old things?

52:18.057 --> 52:20.213
Come on, you know
you bought them yesterday.

52:20.217 --> 52:21.013
- "Monkey On My Back" by Client -

52:21.048 --> 52:22.540
I bought them yesterday.

52:22.576 --> 52:24.860
Well, whenever you bought them,
they are cute.

52:24.907 --> 52:26.130
And you look really good in them.

52:26.177 --> 52:27.300
Thank you.

52:27.335 --> 52:29.483
So, what are you thinking about?

52:32.008 --> 52:33.603
Okay, I'm thinking

52:33.635 --> 52:36.591
just a really long and really straight

52:36.638 --> 52:38.092
bangs,

52:38.137 --> 52:39.561
coming forward like this.

52:40.597 --> 52:43.943
And then, maybe
a couple pieces on the side here,

52:43.986 --> 52:47.223
and a couple of pieces on the side here,
all coming forward,

52:47.256 --> 52:50.830
so string across, and forward here.

52:50.868 --> 52:52.322
Like Jenny's haircut.

52:53.488 --> 52:56.311
No. Oh, I wasn't thinking
it was like Jenny's.

52:56.357 --> 52:59.042
Yeah. It's like...
It is very much like Jenny's.

52:59.077 --> 53:00.653
If that's what you want.

53:00.685 --> 53:01.942
Well,

53:03.358 --> 53:06.141
if you think then we don't have to do it.
That's okay.

53:06.186 --> 53:08.553
Oh, I'm not saying that. I know. I just
wanna make sure that you knew.

53:08.586 --> 53:10.553
So you don't mind
having your hair wannabe

53:10.598 --> 53:12.700
before a little bit
when it's down?

53:12.747 --> 53:14.161
No, that's good.

53:14.195 --> 53:16.823
- Yeah, that looks...
- Bring it down further.

53:19.027 --> 53:21.092
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

53:21.127 --> 53:22.742
That's what you want?

53:26.515 --> 53:28.073
Sure like right about there,

53:28.115 --> 53:30.492
- right above the eyes?
- Right. Yes. Right above the eyes.

53:31.037 --> 53:32.552
I think that's what I want.

53:33.095 --> 53:35.790
She was so noble.
She was gonna take the fall for me.

53:36.507 --> 53:37.982
Where she is?

53:39.095 --> 53:41.442
She's working but I think
she's gonna come over tonight.

53:42.176 --> 53:44.283
I mean, it sucks that she has to resign.

53:44.295 --> 53:47.220
I can't even tell you how fucked
that is. It's so fucked up.

53:47.258 --> 53:50.482
I mean, Jodi is really
the most anti-gun person I've ever met.

53:50.518 --> 53:54.043
And really for her the entire piece
was about gun violence.

53:54.088 --> 53:57.053
I was thinking about getting a gun.

53:57.087 --> 53:59.183
No, you're not getting a gun.

53:59.217 --> 54:01.753
Ever since the robbery?
I wanna protect myself,

54:01.787 --> 54:04.002
- I wanna feel safe.
- You're not gonna feel safe with a gun.

54:04.046 --> 54:06.462
A gun doesn't make you feel safe.
You're not getting a gun.

54:06.495 --> 54:07.280
- You're not.
- Ladies,

54:07.326 --> 54:08.952
you can't go this way,
we're making a movie.

54:08.986 --> 54:11.740
- I live in this neighbourhood.
- And we are friends of the producer,

54:11.775 --> 54:13.390
and the director. So.

54:13.426 --> 54:14.440
It's okay.

54:14.478 --> 54:16.830
- They're with me.
- Oh yeah.

54:19.355 --> 54:21.232
Are you here to visit the set?

54:21.248 --> 54:24.582
- If that's okay.
- It's great! Come on!

54:24.617 --> 54:27.391
I'll show you around.
You're just in time.

54:28.206 --> 54:29.990
We're about to have the martini.

54:30.028 --> 54:32.063
Oh, martini?

54:32.095 --> 54:33.162
Look, not for me.

54:33.198 --> 54:36.052
No, no, that's
the last shot of the day, Kit.

54:38.677 --> 54:40.351
I can't believe you're here.

54:41.165 --> 54:42.660
I couldn't resist.

54:43.537 --> 54:45.051
So you guys are gonna get in the car

54:45.095 --> 54:47.922
and you're gonna pick it up from
"I'm so glad that we're home". Okay?

54:51.357 --> 54:52.990
Everybody?

54:53.037 --> 54:54.613
- Hey!
- Look who's here.

54:54.647 --> 54:56.172
- Hey you guys.
- Hey!

55:01.738 --> 55:03.162
Come sit over here.

55:05.787 --> 55:08.323
Okay, so you guys get in the car...

55:08.365 --> 55:10.140
Jenny is

55:10.848 --> 55:13.460
- fucking the star.
- Oh, Jesus!

55:13.517 --> 55:16.162
Or, should I say
"She is fucking herself".

55:18.017 --> 55:20.381
- Oh, hey, Max. How are you?
- You got your hair cut?

55:20.418 --> 55:21.973
Oh, yeah.

55:22.016 --> 55:23.963
Shane did it. It was her idea.

55:24.508 --> 55:25.631
You like it?

55:25.678 --> 55:27.822
It seems like it's a popular cut
around here.

55:28.918 --> 55:30.053
What do you mean?

55:30.086 --> 55:32.612
I mean, it kinda looks
like Jenny's hair.

55:34.278 --> 55:35.810
I don't think so.

55:35.848 --> 55:37.090
You don't...

55:37.128 --> 55:38.813
It looks good. It looks good on you.

55:41.605 --> 55:43.800
You know the fucking SheBar girls?

55:43.808 --> 55:45.801
They came and they tried
to shut the production down.

55:45.837 --> 55:47.620
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm not kidding.

55:47.686 --> 55:48.492
Yep.

55:48.538 --> 55:50.393
You know, you know,

55:50.425 --> 55:53.021
we're gonna take them down.
That's it. It's on.

55:53.068 --> 55:54.081
- Are you guys with me?
- Yeah.

55:54.125 --> 55:55.802
- I'm always with you.
- No, seriously.

55:55.885 --> 55:58.053
I am. I wish Tasha was here.
She'd know what to do.

55:58.085 --> 55:59.473
Then give her a call.

56:00.077 --> 56:02.001
I'm just saying. Come on.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.810
Wow, this is a really big deal.

56:05.075 --> 56:06.962
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

56:08.475 --> 56:10.240
And Jenny's at the helm.

56:12.116 --> 56:13.173
Yeah.

56:14.015 --> 56:16.172
Really interesting choice on Adele there.

56:16.207 --> 56:19.820
I'm telling you. It was not my choice.
But she just insisted.

56:20.448 --> 56:22.023
What?

56:23.445 --> 56:25.643
- What?
- But she told me that,

56:25.688 --> 56:27.931
that she was uncomfortable with it
and that you

56:28.718 --> 56:30.231
encouraged her to do it.

56:31.228 --> 56:33.573
She said... No! She said that?

56:33.607 --> 56:36.163
Yeah, she said she didn't wanna do it.
You insisted.

56:36.196 --> 56:37.892
- Why would she say that?
- Creepy.

56:38.827 --> 56:40.150
It's freaky, you guys.

56:40.197 --> 56:42.282
You know what?
I think it's gonna be great.

56:43.477 --> 56:45.933
It's gonna be great
because you're producing it.

56:49.058 --> 56:51.031
Sandra, can we shoot?

56:51.077 --> 56:52.680
- Yeah.
- Let's go!

56:54.185 --> 56:56.010
