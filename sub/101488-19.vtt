WEBVTT

00:20.437 --> 00:23.231
Hoo boy, this is a big deal for old Tina.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.691
My first time plant-sitting.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.276
But not my last, if I nail it.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.153
Sure. Plants give referrals, right?

00:28.236 --> 00:30.113
Some give rashes. Does that help?

00:30.196 --> 00:32.198
-Hey there.
-Hello, Mr. Rudy's Dad.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.284
I just want you to know,
your plants are in good hands.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.453
And by hands, I mean
the human leaves of the arms.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.871
These arms.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.081
Okay. Well, come in.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.542
I'll go get the plant-sitting guide.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.919
Warning: I wrote it after
a couple of glasses of vino,

00:45.003 --> 00:46.838
so it gets a little confessional.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.673
There he is. Rudy Rudy bo-booty.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.966
Yep, hi.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.885
Geez, control your excitement, Rudes.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.678
We can leave and come back in.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.473
Maybe this time throw out
a "hey-oh, friends ahoy."

00:56.556 --> 00:58.433
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm stressed.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.226
Dad's going away
for two weeks so I'm packing

01:00.310 --> 01:02.520
for my Mom's place and I don't
want to forget anything.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.689
It's like, how many silk
handkerchiefs should I pack?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.816
-Uh, none?
-But what if there's magic to do?

01:06.900 --> 01:09.527
I can't just run back here
any time I need handkerchiefs.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.404
Okay. Someone's worked up.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.365
Come on, let's go to your room.
You can pack

01:13.448 --> 01:15.158
and we'll help by playing with your toys.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.118
All righty, here's the plant guide.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.913
Oop. You know what,
you don't need to see this page.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.915
-Right this way.
-Knock 'em dead, T.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.542
You mean, uh, water 'em... alive.
(chuckles)

01:24.626 --> 01:26.169
Deep breaths, Tina. You're scaring people.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.379
Yeah, little bit.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.838
Okay, back to packing.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.256
Dress socks-- I brought way

01:30.340 --> 01:31.758
too many last time.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.426
Less is more with these bad boys.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.220
Probably not bringing
your bike to your mom's, huh?

01:35.303 --> 01:37.263
‘Cause of that popped tire?
We rode bikes on the trail

01:37.347 --> 01:39.349
-behind his mom's place.
-Rough terrain.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.476
Popped my tire and shook my soul.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.228
Wow.
You guys are the Goose and Maverick

01:43.311 --> 01:45.063
of just getting your training wheels off.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.606
Whoa.
Check out the snack pile.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.358
(gasps)
Hello, my pretties.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.652
Yeah, my Dad wants me
to take 'em so they don't go stale

01:50.735 --> 01:52.696
while he's away.
It's all healthy stuff.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.155
Mung bean puffs?

01:54.239 --> 01:56.324
(munching)
Bleh. Puff, puff, pass.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.326
The veggie chips are pretty good.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.662
(munching)
Styrofoamy, salty.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.122
-These <i>are</i> good.
-Take 'em.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.915
-Bless you, sir.
-Well,

02:03.998 --> 02:05.000
it's time to pack hats.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.376
Get ready for some tough decisions.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.460
Whoa.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.712
What's that?

02:08.795 --> 02:10.130
That's a fedora.
Cool, right?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.464
No, that.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.133
Huh?
Oh, that's a blaster bridge.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.385
My Dad and I built it.
He had to buy it on eBay

02:15.468 --> 02:17.637
'cause they don't make 'em anymore--
too dangerous.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.140
Wha... What's so dangerous about it?

02:20.223 --> 02:22.100
Uh, allow me to answer your question

02:22.183 --> 02:23.768
by showing you a little something called

02:23.852 --> 02:26.479
"an old ad on the Internet."

02:27.731 --> 02:29.149
The enemy's advancing.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.817
We got to blow the bridge.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.278
BOTH:
Ignition!

02:36.281 --> 02:38.283
Sweet explosive lord.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.076
I know.
I can't wait to blow it up.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.578
Who said anything about waiting?

02:41.661 --> 02:43.413
Why not do it right freaking now?

02:43.496 --> 02:45.373
Well, first of all,
my dad can't be around for it.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.292
He's allergic to sulfur,
which I guess is in

02:47.375 --> 02:49.586
-the explosive thingies.
-Remind me to uninvite your dad

02:49.669 --> 02:51.296
to my hot springs party.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.673
Also, it turns out
the condo board is not into us

02:53.757 --> 02:55.467
blowing up stuff in the common area.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.761
-They sound dumb.
-They are. So, after my dad's vacation,

02:57.844 --> 02:59.304
he's gonna drive it to my mom's house

02:59.387 --> 03:00.597
and I'm gonna blow it up there.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.891
Hey, I know a fun time to do all that.
Now?

03:02.974 --> 03:05.602
No, my plate's pretty full
with packing up all my other stuff

03:05.685 --> 03:08.104
right now.
Speaking of which, back to my hats.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.023
Which one is better for my Mom's house?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.067
Eh or... eh?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.319
-Mm.
-(groans)

03:14.402 --> 03:16.196
So, that about covers the ferns.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.031
And just remember, a little spritz

03:18.114 --> 03:20.075
keeps them looking fern-tastic.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.993
Feel free to use the spray bottle holster

03:22.077 --> 03:24.746
that's in the closet.
It's fun and it goes with any outfit.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.373
-That all make sense?
-Uh-huh.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.667
Okey-doke.
Now on to my pride and joy.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.876
Wow.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.670
Yeah, bonsais.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.713
Are you picturing yourself
shrunken down having

03:33.797 --> 03:36.758
-a lazy day lean against
one of these little beauties?
-Uh, yep.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.802
So water goes in there.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.762
Well, there's more
to bonsai care than that.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.014
These trees are a living art form.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.850
They're delicate and incredibly sensitive.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.644
I heard that. (chuckles)

03:47.727 --> 03:49.521
Seriously, though, I heard it.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.940
Oh, yeah, you can tell
why they outlawed this thing.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.943
Gunpowder and sharp edges?
Mwah.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.569
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.
Don't touch.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.905
The explosive things are old and unstable.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.782
I bumped into it once
when I was getting up

04:00.865 --> 04:02.784
for a midnight tinkle
and a couple of 'em went off.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.452
It was scary and loud.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.955
-Sounds like one wild tinkle.
-Scary and loud?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.040
Are you trying to make me want this more?

04:09.124 --> 04:11.501
It's not always about
what you want, okay, Louise?

04:11.584 --> 04:14.045
Do I wish the bridge
could magically show up

04:14.129 --> 04:16.339
at my mom's house?
Yes. Of course I do!

04:16.423 --> 04:19.426
Because it would be great
and also because I love magic.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.970
But loading this big bridge
would be a whole thing,

04:22.053 --> 04:25.056
and right now I have
to pack for two weeks!

04:25.140 --> 04:26.558
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.143
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.061
I got to say, right now you're being a...

04:30.145 --> 04:31.646
a bit of a weenie.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.482
Uh, hey.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.651
What kind of lighting is that, Rudy--
recessed?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.153
-Louise?
-Mm-hmm?

04:38.236 --> 04:39.988
-Please leave.
-Say what?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.615
I think you should go.
For a lot of reasons.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.659
Also, I'm about to pack my underpants,

04:44.743 --> 04:46.536
and I would like some privacy.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.496
So, yeah, this is Miyoko.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.749
My little scrapper.
Keep an eye on her leaves.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.417
They should be a yellowish-green.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.960
Now, if they're greenish-yellow,

04:54.044 --> 04:55.920
put her under strict observation, okay?

04:56.004 --> 04:58.173
-How strict?
-You never leave her side.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.050
Or, you know, do whatever seems reasonable

05:00.133 --> 05:01.676
for the $25 I'm paying you.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.178
Okay, that's everything.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.221
-Ready, Tina?
-Yep. Coming.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.182
-All right. Take care, kids.
-You, too.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.100
Have fun at your divorced dad safari.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.810
Oh, that-that's not where I'm going.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.479
-Just a guess.
-Okay, bye.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.481
MORT:
So I told the guy,

05:14.564 --> 05:16.149
"Keep jacking up the price of the stuff

05:16.232 --> 05:18.360
and they're gonna have
to call it five-maldehyde."

05:18.443 --> 05:20.653
(gasps, laughs)
Because five is more than four.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.906
-Hm.
-So now I just pay a lot for formaldehyde,

05:22.989 --> 05:24.866
-and that's fine.
-Look at you.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.993
Nothing rattles Mort.
Not even dead people

05:27.077 --> 05:28.953
-and all their shenanigans.
-Yeah.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.498
You always keep your cool.
It's kind of infuriating.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.500
-Nothing rattles you, Mort?!
-BOB: Easy, Teddy.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.502
My secret: I meditate.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.129
And the small stuff
just rolls off my back.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.006
Huh. I always wanted to try that.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.008
And you know who should try it-- this guy.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.219
Nothing rolls off his back,
not even sweat.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.804
It just beads up.
It's weird.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.138
Um, thanks.
I-I mean,

05:47.222 --> 05:48.640
I'm kind of curious about meditation.

05:48.723 --> 05:52.060
I guess I just don't want
to be alone with my thoughts?

05:52.143 --> 05:53.770
Ugh, what's Jimmy doing?

05:53.853 --> 05:55.397
Huh? Nothing.
He's standing there.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.731
It bugs me so much.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.234
I think you'd get
a lot out of meditation, Bob.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.694
I could show you how it's done.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.195
All we need is a quiet place

06:02.278 --> 06:04.364
where no one will bother us
for 20 minutes.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.491
I mean, most days that's the restaurant.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.326
Yeah, we could do it here.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.620
I need to finish Mrs. Sobel's
makeup for the service.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.914
Her last wishes were "Have fun with it."

06:12.997 --> 06:14.874
But I can come back tomorrow.
How's that? Who's in?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.543
-Sure.
-Sounds good.
-I'm in.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.462
Then it's a date--
a medi-date to medi-tate.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.172
Oh, don't ruin it, Mort.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.092
Louise, everything okay?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.511
You keep riding into my back tire.
(grunts)

06:26.594 --> 06:29.180
-What? Oh, I'm fine.
-Are you thinking about how bad

06:29.264 --> 06:31.933
you feel about calling Rudy
a weenie in front of his hats?

06:32.017 --> 06:33.435
(scoffs)
No.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.729
I was just thinking about... logistics.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.523
I believe you're trying to say
"la fish sticks"?

06:38.606 --> 06:40.400
Logistics about
how you're gonna apologize,

06:40.483 --> 06:42.402
because it sounds like you should?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.029
I do not need to apologize.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.822
I meant logistics for my plan.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.741
I got Rudy's message, loud and clear.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.951
He wants to blow up that bridge so bad.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.245
And he wants us to make that happen ASAP.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.122
Okay, great, but it doesn't seem

06:54.205 --> 06:55.874
like that was his message at all?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.709
It was, and tomorrow
we can help with that.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.420
This is just a transportation glitch.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.005
Glitch, please.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.177
Okay, I'm heading to Rudy's dad's house.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.553
-Bye, everyone.
-Bye, Tina.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.221
Have fun sitting on your plants.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.682
Uh, wait, Tina, um, Gene and I
thought we'd go with you.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.184
You know, for moral support.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.478
-Aw, so nice.
-That is nice.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.522
Yeah, weirdly nice. Sorry.
I didn't mean to say weirdly.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.316
But why do you want to do that?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.193
Because we're really great siblings?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.278
Yeah, you are.
Now go on, get.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.655
And next time you see us,
we'll be all chilled out,

07:27.739 --> 07:29.699
‘cause Mort's gonna teach us
how to meditate.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.785
Really?
Even you, Dad?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.203
I know.
I'm scared.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.662
Hey, if you want to try ayahuasca next,

07:34.746 --> 07:35.789
Ken knows a shaman.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.332
Thanks. Ken's not real.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.250
The shaman said none of us are real.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.585
I've got to be honest, I was feeling

07:40.669 --> 07:42.170
the plant-sitting jitters, but now that

07:42.253 --> 07:43.672
I've got you two on my side, nothing...

07:43.755 --> 07:45.548
Yep, yep, sounds good, so let's

07:45.632 --> 07:47.092
run through the plan
for moving Rudy's bridge

07:47.175 --> 07:48.760
-over to his mom's place.
-Wait.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.637
-You're still serious about that?
-Uh, yeah.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.180
I want to blow up the bridge.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.515
Rudy wants to blow up the bridge.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.058
So I'm doing this amazing favor

07:55.141 --> 07:56.351
and he's lucky to have me

07:56.434 --> 07:57.602
and I never did or said anything wrong.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.646
Okay, but I don't think I can help.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.523
Those plants need a lot of attention.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.775
Rudy's dad said
they feel jealousy, too, so I...

08:03.858 --> 08:06.069
Tina, relax.
Gene and I have got this.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.488
So here's the plan:
we can balance the model

08:08.571 --> 08:10.490
on one of our bikes and walk it over to...

08:10.573 --> 08:12.200
-Aah!
-What, Gene?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.077
-You used the W word.
-Walk?

08:14.160 --> 08:15.745
-Aah!
-Okay.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.872
Maybe instead we do the leg-positive thing

08:17.956 --> 08:20.250
and ask Mom and Dad
to drive the model for us?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.876
Dad wouldn't want it in the car.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.503
Remember how weird he was
about taking home

08:23.586 --> 08:25.005
that bottle rocket we found?

08:25.088 --> 08:26.423
You mean Little Orphan Boom Boom?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.091
I think this is
what we call in the business

08:28.174 --> 08:30.385
a "don't tell Mom and Dad" situation.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.553
Mm.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.804
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>Huh. It's a little...</i>

08:32.887 --> 08:34.472
bigger than I remembered.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.850
-Uh-huh.
-Gene, you haven't finished those yet?

08:36.933 --> 08:39.227
I'm pacing myself. Oh, no.
Are these healthy snacks

08:39.310 --> 08:41.187
giving me healthy eating habits?

08:41.271 --> 08:42.397
I don't want to think about it.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.606
You guys, look at these leaves.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.692
Do they look sick or really, really fine?

08:45.775 --> 08:48.069
Are they supposed to fall off
when you breath on them?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.530
Uh, I don't think so.
I guess I could read to her?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.115
Rudy's dad left a reading list.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.159
Lot of grown-up books.
Who's Henry Miller?

08:54.242 --> 08:56.995
No offense, T, but we've got
our own problems right now.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.330
Whoa, that's the bridge?
It's kind of big, right?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.041
And fragile.
And explosive.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.792
-Aren't we all?
-Cool, cool.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.669
So maybe don't do this plan?

09:04.753 --> 09:06.796
-Because it's bad?
-Nuh-uh.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.923
We're doing it.
But, hey, it's me and Gene.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.925
The professionals.
We can handle it.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.594
-Sure, sure.
-Gene, get that side?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.095
-Roger that.
-(grunting)

09:14.179 --> 09:15.597
Is anything happening?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.015
This is killing me.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.476
LOUISE:
Thanks for helping, Tina.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.311
Rudy's mom lives less than a mile away.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.854
So we should be there in time

09:22.937 --> 09:24.481
for Rudy's afternoon nasal cleanse.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.857
I'd hate to miss it.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.901
Okay, this should work
for little sickie Miyoko.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.487
What's, uh, going on
with that whole situation, Tina?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.073
Rudy's dad uses it so the bonsais
can hear his heartbeat.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.492
When I want that I just
climb up inside Dad's shirt

09:35.575 --> 09:37.202
like a baby kangaroo.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.536
MORT:
Everyone comfortable?

09:38.620 --> 09:39.746
-Yeah
-Uh-huh.

09:39.829 --> 09:40.872
How about you, Bob?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.499
I mean, things hurt.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.876
But, um, you know, a normal amount.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.170
Very good.
Now, everyone, close your eyes.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.506
I want you to focus on your breath.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.965
Breath or breasts?

09:51.049 --> 09:52.300
(groans)
Mort, sicko.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.718
I said breath.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.803
-Oh.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.388
If your thoughts distract you,

09:56.471 --> 09:58.348
just come back to your <i>breath.</i>

09:58.431 --> 10:00.600
(yawning):
I think I'm starting to feel something.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.435
MORT:
Thoughts are going to arise.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.270
Don't resist them.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.481
What are you doing?
The walk-in needs to be cleaned.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.526
-Mm.
-Also shouldn't you be doing
sit-ups instead of this?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.695
And also aren't you hungry right now?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.780
-He just ate.
-Yeah, but that doesn't count.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.449
-If he's hungry he's hungry.
-Yeah, don't food shame him.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.243
Hmm.
I'm starting to get hungry now.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.704
Will you guys look at this mole?
Uh, normal? Scary?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.248
-(Bob whimpers)
-MORT: Just come back to the breath.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.834
-(Bob breathing deeply)
-That's it, breathe.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.461
Breathe.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.547
-Breathe.
-♪ ♪

10:32.298 --> 10:34.467
<i>And open your eyes.</i>

10:34.551 --> 10:37.429
Wow, that felt... really good.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.681
-H-How about you guys?
-(snoring) Wha-wha-wha...

10:41.516 --> 10:43.143
Okay, easy does it.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.352
Don't want to set anything off.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.312
We're going pretty slow.
So slow

10:46.396 --> 10:48.106
that I can't tell
for sure if we're moving.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.149
Wait, are we moving?

10:49.232 --> 10:51.818
-Ah, bump.
-Slower. Go slower.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.404
Gene, eyes on the road.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.824
Just one more chip.
My body needs fuel.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.867
-Aah!
-What the...

10:58.950 --> 11:01.411
Sprinklers!
Back it up, people.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.080
The model-- did it get wet?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.957
I think water's bad
for the explosive thingies.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.876
That could be a line from <i>The Hurt Locker.</i>

11:07.959 --> 11:10.420
Oh, no.
Miyoko, please tell me you didn't get wet.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.047
I've already watered her today.
Overwatering is

11:12.130 --> 11:13.465
very bad for a bonsai.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.841
Phew, okay, she's dry.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.552
The model's dry, too.
All right, uh, new plan.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.138
We cross the street,
go around the sprinklers.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.765
I don't think so.
Look.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.351
GENE:
Ah, this neighborhood loves irrigation.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.436
Maybe we could walk
really slowly in the street,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.480
hope cars see a sick bonsai
and a bridge model

11:28.563 --> 11:30.065
and just kind of get it.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.610
Or we, uh, go through.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.028
Nope, nope, don't like it.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.530
It'll be easy.
We just, uh, time it out

11:37.614 --> 11:38.782
so the sprinklers don't hit us.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.408
Did you say go back to Rudy's dad's house?

11:40.492 --> 11:41.618
I think that's what I heard.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.661
Come on, we got to get this thing to Rudy

11:43.745 --> 11:45.914
to make him feel better, in general.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.832
Not about the weenie thing.
Who brought that up?

11:47.916 --> 11:49.292
-Geez, Tina, let it go.
-Huh?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.336
So, are we gonna do this thing or what?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.504
(sighs)
Fine.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.464
Veggie chip, give me strength.
Yum-yum.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.943
Doing great, guys.
Almost there.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.112
This is so stressful.
Stress isn't good for plants.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.446
Or plant-sitters.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.906
Relax.
This is Rudy's mom's street.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.783
We turn here and it's a straight shot.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.118
Or... maybe not.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.244
GENE:
Oh, boy.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.870
TINA:
Torn-up street and no sidewalk.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.622
-Great.
-This would be a perfect time

12:27.706 --> 12:30.417
for a giant drone
to swoop down and carry us over.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.669
Hint, hint, Jeff Bezos.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.923
What do we do now, Louise?

12:37.007 --> 12:39.217
Well, I mean, there is another way.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.635
Over there.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.637
We dump this thing
and go live in the woods?

12:42.721 --> 12:45.390
-I'm into that.
-That's the trail
Rudy and I ride on sometimes.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.559
It goes right behind Rudy's mom's house.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.977
Isn't that the trail that's so rough

12:49.060 --> 12:51.146
-it popped Rudy's bike tire?
-Wait, what?

12:51.229 --> 12:52.564
It's not <i>that</i> bad.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.358
I mean, yeah, the trail's a little bumpy.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.110
-Aah...
-Aah...

12:57.193 --> 12:59.320
Okay, pretty bumpy.
But it's our only option.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.948
It's way farther if we turn back.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.575
Uh...

13:03.658 --> 13:05.618
And hey, thanks again
for the pushing you've been doing.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.371
I mean, pizza and beers on me
when this is all over, eh?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.790
-If that thing doesn't
blow up and kill us all.
-What was that?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.500
Nothing. Into the woods.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, steady.
Watch out. Bump coming.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.464
Another bump coming.
Lot of bumps coming.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.631
Yeah, it's all friggin' bumps.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.050
It's the bumpiest trail in the world.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.718
The bridge is gonna explode,
and there's gonna be

13:21.801 --> 13:22.969
bonsai organs everywhere, Louise.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.763
I have six and a quarter
veggie chips left.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.599
I hope I live to snack on them again.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.684
BOB:
You know, I feel really calm.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.811
It's like I did one nice thing
for my brain ever,

13:31.895 --> 13:33.855
and it can't stop thanking me.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.358
I know.
I feel so refreshed.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.068
Well, you did fall asleep.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.070
No, I meditated.
I went deep.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.696
To sleep.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.739
I feel terrific, too.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.240
So meditated.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.242
-Oh, yeah?
-No. It didn't work.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.453
I don't know, I just thought
about wrenches the whole time.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.705
Was I supposed to?
Is that good?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.916
Hey, Bob.
Can I borrow some empty space?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.460
My restaurant ran out.
Heh, zoom.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.421
Ha.
That's a thinker, but it's good.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.423
Hey, Jimmy, Trev.
What's up?

14:00.507 --> 14:03.009
"Hey, Jimmy"?
What's with you, cool guy?

14:03.093 --> 14:05.011
Bob's relaxed 'cause he meditated.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.055
-We all did.
-But we're beginners and we're learning,

14:07.138 --> 14:08.890
and it doesn't always work the first time.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.142
Meditated?
Sounds stupid.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.435
It's actually really calming.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.729
You know what?
I'm gonna do it again right now.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.814
Ew, gross.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.273
I just close my eyes

14:17.357 --> 14:18.733
and focus on my breath.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.362
Focus on some breath <i>mints. </i>Zoom.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.197
-(laughs)
-Ha.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.366
If I have thoughts, that's totally fine.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.160
I come back to the breath.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.579
Breathe in.
(inhales)

14:31.663 --> 14:33.957
Breathe out.
(exhales)

14:34.040 --> 14:35.250
Eh, this is dumb.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.502
Uh, let's go make fun
of people who park bad.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.421
That's fine. Whatever you guys want to do.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.506
Okay, now Bob's kind of scary calm.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.258
-Linda?
-(Linda snoring)

14:43.341 --> 14:44.467
Huh?
Wha-Wha-Wha?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.595
-(panting): How much further?
-See that?

14:47.679 --> 14:49.431
That is the back of Rudy's mom's house.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.266
It's exactly how I always imagined

14:51.349 --> 14:53.018
the back of Rudy's mom's house.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.686
But for some reason I pictured a pergola.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.271
I need to catch my breath.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.773
Really Miyoko's breath,
because she gives off oxygen.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.775
I know about plants.
Also, they hurt you

15:00.859 --> 15:02.777
when they press against you
for a long time.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.863
Time to rotate her.
Gene, you got this?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.406
-Okay.
-Aah!

15:06.489 --> 15:07.949
Gene, you said you had it!

15:08.033 --> 15:09.743
I thought you wanted me
to rotate the bonsai!

15:09.826 --> 15:10.785
I get that a lot!

15:10.869 --> 15:12.954
(distorted):
No...!

15:14.039 --> 15:15.832
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.500
-Aah!
-Got 'em!
-Yes! Ha-ha!

15:17.584 --> 15:18.960
Eat it, gravity!

15:19.044 --> 15:21.212
-Louise, could you check Miyoko?
-Sure.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.589
-Uh...
-What?

15:22.672 --> 15:25.091
Do, uh, bonsais shed their limbs off?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.718
-Miyoko's branch!
-Yikes.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.219
-Uh-oh.
-Louise, all I wanted

15:28.303 --> 15:29.929
was to do a good job plant-sitting,

15:30.013 --> 15:31.681
and now I've ripped Miyoko's arm off.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.850
-I thought that was his wiener.
-Miyoko's a girl.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.518
<i>Her</i> wiener.
Sorry.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.520
(grunts)
This whole bridge-moving thing.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.814
You just want to blow it up.
That's all you care about.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.817
Now Miyoko's bleeding to death.
Maybe. I-I don't know.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.361
Of course I want to blow it up.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.196
But that's not the only reason
I'm doing this.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.823
I just feel like I have
to do this because of what I...

15:48.907 --> 15:50.200
Ah, forget it.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.078
Oh, my God, is this all
just your really weird,

15:53.161 --> 15:54.996
totally inconvenient way
of saying you're sorry

15:55.080 --> 15:56.456
without saying you're sorry?

15:56.539 --> 15:59.084
(scoffs)
That's crazy. Saying I'm sorry?

15:59.167 --> 16:03.296
For what? For being a great
friend who delivers bridges?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.215
RUDY:
Huh? What are you guys doing here?

16:05.298 --> 16:06.633
Is that my bridge model?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.635
-What the hell?
-Oh, hey, Rudes.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.387
What are you doing here?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.013
In your... backyard?

16:12.097 --> 16:14.015
I heard shouting, so I came to see...

16:14.099 --> 16:16.643
Wait. You brought the model
from my dad's house?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.687
And now it's hanging over a cliff?

16:18.770 --> 16:20.146
I mean, it's not really a cliff.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.065
-But...
-Uh, hey, how about you help us

16:22.148 --> 16:23.566
pull these bikes up,

16:23.650 --> 16:24.943
and then we can talk
about how excited you are

16:25.026 --> 16:27.445
that I... <i>we</i> did this for you.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.197
-Ha-ha.
-On a lighter note,

16:29.280 --> 16:31.741
looks like you picked the perfect hat.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.830
Easy...

16:36.913 --> 16:38.665
Ah. Nice work, everyone.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.125
-What a team.
-So, uh,

16:40.208 --> 16:42.293
maybe we can move this thing
somewhere safe? I mean...

16:42.377 --> 16:44.462
-It's already sliding off again!
-Oh, my God.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.297
Yeah, you guys are not great at this.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.800
Bob. Linda.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.427
Jimmy, what happened to your voice?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.470
I went back to my restaurant
and meditated.

16:52.554 --> 16:55.056
-Just like you did, Bob.
-Yeah, <i>Bob.</i>

16:55.140 --> 16:56.850
I feel so relaxed,

16:56.933 --> 17:00.186
like I just had a long,
totally legit massage.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.396
That's great, Jimmy.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.065
Yeah. I came over to say
I think it worked for me

17:04.149 --> 17:06.776
even better than it worked for you, Bob.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.862
Well, it's not a competition, Jimmy.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.488
That's something you'd say when you know

17:10.572 --> 17:12.741
-you'd lose the competition.
-Ha.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.743
Uh-oh, fightin' words.

17:14.826 --> 17:15.952
Who would judge?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.829
Not Linda.
That'd be illegal.

17:17.912 --> 17:18.997
Not Trev, either.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.457
Fair.
We're too close.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.666
We're not that close.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.585
-Brother from another mother.
-No.

17:23.668 --> 17:24.878
How about Mort?
I mean...

17:24.961 --> 17:26.838
Ugh. This is dumb.
Forget I said anything.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.965
Great idea, Linda.
I'm gonna call Mort.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.216
All right.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.470
Okay, so, you have your bridge,

17:33.553 --> 17:36.014
and you can blow it up whenever you want.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.557
It's not about us.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.018
And to prove it, we will take our leave.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.353
Oh. Okay.
Bye, Rudy.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.188
I'm just gonna go back to your dad's.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.982
Miyoko had a nice walk,
and she is, um, perfectly fine.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.151
Huh.
I definitely want to blow it up.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.320
And you guys could watch,
since you're here anyway.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.072
-You... sure?
-Yeah.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.616
-Very well. Whatever the gentleman wants.
-Ugh.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.785
Okay, great. Let me just
go grab some safety goggles

17:56.868 --> 17:58.328
and some explosion snacks.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.580
I wouldn't say no to a chip
of the veggie variety,

18:00.663 --> 18:01.831
if you're still holding.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.333
MORT:
As I once said

18:03.416 --> 18:05.210
about eco-friendly cardboard caskets,

18:05.293 --> 18:08.171
I'm not sure how this will work,
but I'm game to try.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.215
Yeah, how do you even judge
a thing like this?

18:10.298 --> 18:12.133
It's fine.
We'll figure it out, right?

18:12.217 --> 18:14.594
Point for Jimmy.
Calm acceptance.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.930
Yeah.
Jimmy accepted the crap out of that.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.724
-Good for you, Jimmy.
-That's a point for Bob.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.267
Am I late?
Linda texted me

18:21.351 --> 18:23.019
that there was
a who-meditated-better contest.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.771
They're just starting.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.022
How's business, Jimmy?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.274
Fantastic.
How's it here? Bad?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.735
Point deduction.
Insults are not Zen.

18:30.819 --> 18:31.903
Sorry, pal.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.905
Point for Jimmy.
Owning mistakes.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.615
-Oh, I didn't mind it.
-Point for Bob.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.158
You know, when you think about it,

18:37.242 --> 18:39.869
there's no "my point" or "Jimmy's point."

18:39.953 --> 18:42.789
It's just... one point we all share.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.124
Ten points for Bob.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.377
-I think Bob's winning.
-Bob's like a monk.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.920
Yeah, with even less hair.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.380
(chuckles)
Good one.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.173
Laughing Buddha point for Bob.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.717
Negative 20 points for Jimmy.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.801
Come on, seriously?

18:54.884 --> 18:56.678
Where do you get these numbers from?

18:56.761 --> 18:59.055
Negative five points.
I'm doing my best.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.224
Oh, here's a point: you're dumb.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.643
You're dumb. You're dumb.
You're all dumb.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.603
And I'm great.
I win.

19:05.687 --> 19:09.065
-Come on, Trev.
-Wow. Your forehead vein is really big.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.525
Will you shush?
I know it is.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.652
I can see it out of the corner of my eye.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.529
-Yay, Bobby!
-You crushed him, Bob!

19:14.612 --> 19:16.031
You wiped the floor with him.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.033
Negative point for Teddy.
Aggressive.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.200
Mort, so help me...

19:19.284 --> 19:21.327
Oh, God.
Being relaxed is exhausting.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.329
I think I'm gonna go clean the grill

19:23.413 --> 19:26.249
-and stress about things for a bit.
-You do that, sweetie.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.460
We'll hang out here.
Mort can keep giving us points.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.545
-How many points for me, Mort?
-Uh, four.

19:30.628 --> 19:31.755
Yay!

19:31.838 --> 19:33.590
Stand back, everybody.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.052
Big explosion in five, four,

19:37.135 --> 19:39.137
three, two,

19:39.220 --> 19:40.805
one, ignition!

19:40.889 --> 19:42.057
I'm sorry I called you a weenie!

19:44.059 --> 19:45.643
Whoa.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.730
That's it?
I expected it to be... louder.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.733
-And blow-up-ier.
-I expected to need new underwear.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.735
But these tighties remain whitey.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.487
Well, my ears are still ringing, baby.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.489
Wait.
Did you just say you were sorry?

19:57.572 --> 19:58.656
I guess.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.825
Yeah, I am sorry.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.119
Huh.
I mean, you kind of wedged it in there.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.121
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I kept pushing you

20:05.205 --> 20:06.623
when you were stressed out.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.667
And I'm sorry I called you a weenie.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.960
You're not.
You're the opposite of a weenie.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.381
-A beanie?
-And I'm sorry I didn't
just say sorry right away.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.466
I'm not great at that, maybe.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.093
And I'm glad we're friends.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.844
Thanks, Louise.
Right back atcha.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.430
Also, since the sorry train
has left the station--

20:22.514 --> 20:25.517
Tina, I'm sorry about Miyoko's branch.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.644
It's okay. Maybe I wasn't
cut out for plant-sitting.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.146
Some days the plants
sit on you, am I right?

20:30.230 --> 20:32.065
Whoa, did you trim Miyoko?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.858
-Um...
-It works.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.652
I think she looks more balanced.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.571
-My dad's gonna love it.
-Oh. I-I mean, yeah, he should.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.156
So... now what do we blow up?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.825
Well, I don't want to blow them up,

20:41.908 --> 20:43.493
but I packed my silk handkerchiefs.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.495
(singsongy):
Who's in the mood for some magic?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.497
-GENE and TINA: Me.
-Or we could blow up that chair.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.041
-No, no, I-I like that chair.
-Or that bird feeder?

20:50.125 --> 20:52.043
No. Louise, I...
You don't understand.

20:52.127 --> 20:54.963
(laughs): I'm kidding.
Rudy, go get those handkerchiefs.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.632
Okay.
Or do I have them already?

20:57.716 --> 20:59.634
No, I don't.
Okay, I got to go get them.

20:59.718 --> 21:00.844
I-I'll be right back.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.608
<i>BOB (echoing): Come back to the breath.</i>

21:15.692 --> 21:18.194
<i>Breathe in. (inhales)</i>

21:18.278 --> 21:20.321
<i>Breathe out. (exhales)</i>

21:20.405 --> 21:22.449
<i>LINDA: I meditated. I went deep.</i>

21:22.532 --> 21:24.534
<i>BOB: Oh, God. Being relaxed is exhausting.</i>

21:32.042 --> 21:33.877
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>I think I'm starting to feel something.</i>
