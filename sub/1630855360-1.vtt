01:35.878 --> 01:38.837
<i>I never knew why
we prayed so much growin' up.</i>

01:40.274 --> 01:42.928
<i>So, one day them Union boys
came to my plantation</i>

01:42.972 --> 01:45.061
<i>and told me and my folks
we were free.</i>

01:47.281 --> 01:49.196
<i>Best day of our lives.</i>

01:50.893 --> 01:53.113
<i>Mama said our prayers
had been answered.</i>

01:57.552 --> 02:00.120
<i>I remember me and my folks
walking out that plantation</i>

02:00.163 --> 02:02.731
<i>till our feet couldn't even
feel the ground no more.</i>

02:04.472 --> 02:05.908
<i>We just kept walkin'.</i>

02:07.475 --> 02:10.130
<i>Kept walkin',
but we had nowhere to go.</i>

02:12.175 --> 02:14.656
<i>- We were free...</i>

02:14.699 --> 02:17.049
<i>...but we had no place
to be free.</i>

02:18.834 --> 02:20.401
<i>So I'm askin' you, Lord...</i>

02:22.881 --> 02:25.928
<i>...protect me on this journey.</i>

02:25.971 --> 02:28.887
<i>Help me reach my piece
of the promised land.</i>

02:31.325 --> 02:33.065
<i>Deliver me from this evil.</i>

02:34.980 --> 02:36.199
<i>Amen.</i>

02:38.332 --> 02:40.203
Get in.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.229
Move.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.433
The war
was an unfortunate step

03:36.477 --> 03:37.565
in the right direction.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.697
Look at
what just walked in.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.048
Where did he come from?

03:56.105 --> 03:57.802
Iron on the bar.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.995
Coffee. Please.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.170
Coffee.

04:19.824 --> 04:20.825
Yeah.

05:15.837 --> 05:16.838
Ma'am.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.208
Whoa there, fella!

05:39.251 --> 05:40.992
Where you think you're headed?

05:41.036 --> 05:42.559
I bought a seat.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.039
From the man up there.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.215
Andy, huh?

05:46.258 --> 05:48.826
This fella buy a seat?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.393
Yeah, that's right.
Just a little bit ago.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.829
Says you.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.920
Throw me down them shackles.

05:56.747 --> 05:57.922
All right.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.367
You got papers?

06:07.410 --> 06:08.542
I'm free.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.376
Irregardless of what you say,

06:16.419 --> 06:18.378
you still gotta
show us your papers.

06:19.857 --> 06:20.989
Come on now.
I ain't got all day.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.469
Don't make me ask twice.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.480
"Mo..."

06:35.177 --> 06:36.570
Washington.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.701
Washington.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.529
Washington? Ha-ha.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.707
What an honorable appellation.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.929
You carryin'?

06:49.670 --> 06:50.671
Give it.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.463
Now, you might have
passage on this trip,

07:00.507 --> 07:03.292
but there ain't nothin' says
I got to have you at my back,

07:03.335 --> 07:04.467
gun at the ready.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.123
Well, what you got
in that case?

07:10.691 --> 07:12.301
Bible and some dried meat.

07:19.526 --> 07:22.224
Hey.
Fat boy, wake up.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.359
There's a luggage seat
in the back.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.450
Is that a man or a boy?

07:33.278 --> 07:36.281
Well, which would
you prefer, madam?

07:51.993 --> 07:53.124
Curly.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.998
Do you need my gun too?

07:57.041 --> 07:59.000
Of course not, Mr. Wheeler.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.667
Let's go.

08:18.933 --> 08:22.327
All right, stage for
Colorado's leavin'. Let's go.

08:24.982 --> 08:28.856
Lord, just get me
from here to there.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.676
- Ma'am.
- Ah.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.243
Madam.

09:09.418 --> 09:12.595
Claude Aloysius Fields,
at your service.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.163
The Ol' Wildcat from Kentucky.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.949
You see? That's me.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.986
"Territory of Colorado

09:57.597 --> 10:00.208
"hereby grants
to Mo Washington,

10:03.124 --> 10:04.995
"ownership of this land."

10:26.234 --> 10:27.975
Let's go, Andy.
Let's go, buddy.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.106
All right. I'm comin'.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.951
I talked to Curly.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.301
Thought you might need this.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.131
I seen rattlers out here
bigger than you.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.397
This is a fine Remington.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.442
Lot of power.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.315
Needed something
easy to handle.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.797
- Can't shoot a dead buffalo.
- Mm.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.676
Quite a few notches
in your handle here.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.477
You got family out here?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.612
No, sir.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.092
Just passin' through.

11:43.485 --> 11:44.660
Headed west.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.316
Just lookin' for a new start.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.713
You?

11:55.976 --> 11:57.281
Wife and daughter.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.675
They're home.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.374
Missus is expectin'.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.508
Any day now.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.295
I don't like
leavin' them alone.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.043
I'll need it back
in the mornin'.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.994
Andy, go help the lady.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.823
What are you laughing at?

13:05.959 --> 13:07.569
Do you feel
relieved, Madam?

13:07.612 --> 13:10.311
Do you never shut up?

13:10.354 --> 13:12.139
Hyah! Hyah!

13:58.098 --> 13:59.142
Let's flank 'em.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.709
To the right! To the right!

14:04.147 --> 14:05.670
Shit.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.638
Hold up! Hold up!

14:16.681 --> 14:18.596
Drop the rifle!

14:18.640 --> 14:20.294
Hold up! Hold up!

14:22.557 --> 14:24.167
Get 'em out.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.300
What's happening?

14:26.778 --> 14:28.041
Road agents.

14:28.563 --> 14:29.956
Road agents?

14:30.695 --> 14:32.654
Marauders.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.269
Hands where
I can see 'em, cowboy.

14:45.928 --> 14:46.973
Ain't you gonna shoot 'em?

14:47.016 --> 14:49.714
I do, they take us all out.

14:49.758 --> 14:53.631
If they push for a last stand,
they'll get one.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.245
Just be glad
they're not Indians.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.116
Nobody make
no sudden moves.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.511
Mm.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.776
Now, we don't need
anyone getting hurt.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.911
All right,
you boys know what to do.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.355
Tommy, what about the money?

15:21.398 --> 15:22.660
Don't fuckin' touch me.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.010
Tommy!

15:24.053 --> 15:26.316
We, uh...
We ain't got nothing of value.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.970
We ain't got no mail, no gold.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.146
Just what
the passengers brought.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.757
If I want it, it has value.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.108
Now, let me see y'all's hands.

15:35.151 --> 15:38.285
Huh. You're Tommy Walsh.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.116
Tommy Walsh?

15:44.813 --> 15:47.163
The bank robber, Tommy Walsh?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.081
Let's see
what you got, folks.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.954
We'll all be on our merry way.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.999
Out! Out!

15:57.043 --> 15:58.783
Come on out
and stretch your legs.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.091
You too, chuckaboo.

16:02.135 --> 16:05.790
Your presence is requested
forthwith, Madam.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.836
I'm not moving from this spot.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.055
Suit yourself.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.149
All right,
come on now, folks.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.074
Take it easy.
I got all the horses.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.860
Well,
do what you gotta do,

16:31.903 --> 16:33.688
but do it real careful.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.259
Join us.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.307
We're all equals here.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.048
Everybody out.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.919
I'd do as they say, ma'am.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.142
Get on down.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.277
All right, gentlemen,

16:58.234 --> 17:00.715

at them billfolds.

17:01.716 --> 17:02.934
Thank you, sir.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.675
Much obliged.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.765
That'll do.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.080
There ain't shit
up here.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.299
Just throw all that shit away.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.387
Much appreciated.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.520
No, it's just clothes.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.873
No, they ain't kiddin'.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.137
- There ain't nothing up here.
- Well, you take it anyway!

17:32.355 --> 17:33.574
Yes, sir.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.663
And hurry up.
Come on, gentlemen.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.099
Check underneath.
Check underneath.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.710
What about the money
from the bank, huh?

17:39.754 --> 17:41.103
No,
there ain't nothing here.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.062
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>

17:45.934 --> 17:47.283
How about you, <i>amigo?</i>

17:47.327 --> 17:48.502
What you got?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.941
Couple of coins
in here. That's it.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.812
All right,
pack them up.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.430
- Oh...
-What the hell?

18:03.473 --> 18:04.996
Thunderation.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.172
My apologies, gentlemen.

18:06.215 --> 18:09.044
No need to alarm you.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.047
I don't know,
it appears that...

18:12.091 --> 18:13.701
There seems to be
something wrong

18:15.790 --> 18:17.052
with my ticker.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.632
Oh, shit!

18:35.984 --> 18:37.725
Come on,
give me a hand.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.248
Get away from me!

18:41.729 --> 18:44.123
I'll murder you.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.570
Get off me!

19:09.104 --> 19:10.149
Brogan!

19:27.731 --> 19:28.906
Hey!

19:48.448 --> 19:49.840
Take my hand.
Take it quick.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.495
- Come on and jump!
-I can't, I can't jump.

19:52.539 --> 19:53.670
Please, take my hand.

19:56.325 --> 19:57.761
-I can't, I can't!
- Jump!

19:57.805 --> 19:59.328
I can't.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.367
Son of a bitch!

20:38.411 --> 20:39.412
Hey, kid!

20:45.853 --> 20:47.637
That hurts!

20:48.334 --> 20:49.335
Son of a bitch.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.599
Kid, shoot him!

20:53.469 --> 20:54.644
Shoot him!

21:08.441 --> 21:09.485
Get up.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.332
Careful of this.

21:32.726 --> 21:33.944
Ow!

21:35.163 --> 21:37.426
Look out!

21:43.476 --> 21:44.694
You're a good shot.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.523
Stay with me.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.962
- See that tree right there?
-Huh? Uh-huh.

21:55.618 --> 21:56.663
Uh-huh.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.815
Oh, my God!

23:02.642 --> 23:05.514
Tommy! Tommy!

23:05.558 --> 23:07.647
They got Brogan, bad!

23:09.300 --> 23:10.867
He's dying, Tommy.

23:12.260 --> 23:16.046
Give yourself up,
we can get him to a doctor.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.744
What do I do?

23:17.787 --> 23:20.224
Heck,
you know what to do!

23:20.268 --> 23:21.617
Now you do it!

23:23.271 --> 23:25.099
It's on you, Tommy.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.280
You go and gather up
the boys now.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.458
Don't tell 'em
where the money's at.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.722
You just gather the boys!

24:18.892 --> 24:20.502
That's just
the start of it.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.462
Get up.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.463
Get up!

24:29.337 --> 24:31.295
Get him over here,
Curly. Quit it.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.167
Come on! Get him up.

24:35.952 --> 24:37.388
Boy, you better lower that gun

24:37.432 --> 24:39.303
if you don't wanna wind up
on the wrong end of it.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.436
Get him over here.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.310
Easy now, Curly. Easy now.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.486
Come help me.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.270
Come help me.

24:54.188 --> 24:57.191
He ain't got
the rights to do this to me.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.150
You cockroaches killed Andy.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.196
And you wanna
talk to me about rights?

25:02.239 --> 25:04.111
Curly!

25:04.154 --> 25:06.243
You kill him, you hang.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.289
There ain't a court
that'd convict me.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.117
They would
after I have my say.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.945
Now put that gun down.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.518
I'll trust you
to keep it down.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.739
All right...

25:23.783 --> 25:26.133
Mr. Fields, we're gonna get
you to a doctor soon enough.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.526
There's one
back in Brushwood Gulch.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.484
All right.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.659
All right,

25:30.703 --> 25:32.182
first things first.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.228
Go gather your team
and your stagecoach.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.361
Stage went
over the cliff, sir.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.668
With the woman inside?

25:42.497 --> 25:44.325
What about my horses?

25:44.368 --> 25:45.500
They scattered.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.242
G... God damn it!

25:48.982 --> 25:50.897
God damn it.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.681
This is
what we're gonna do.

25:53.726 --> 25:57.294
Curly, you're gonna
grab a horse.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.863
You're gonna ride
Mr. Fields to a doctor.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.562
I'm gonna take the mountain
pass to Wagon Gap.

26:03.605 --> 26:06.521
I'm gonna get the sheriff and
a posse and bring 'em here.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.523
What about this piece of shit?

26:11.221 --> 26:13.136
I'm gonna tie him
to this here tree.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.052
He'll stand guard.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.620
Him?

26:18.664 --> 26:20.579
This beanpole? Guard him?

26:22.276 --> 26:23.973
That's Tommy Walsh, you know.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.149
He can handle himself.

26:26.193 --> 26:28.804
Now go get somethin'
to tie him with. Go on.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.240
God damn it.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.460
Corral my goods
if you please, sir.

26:32.503 --> 26:33.809
Yes, sir.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.993
This is gonna be
one hell of a night.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.136
I'm sorry about
your stagecoach driver.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.747
You get smart with me?

26:58.791 --> 26:59.879
Let's see how smart you are

26:59.922 --> 27:02.055
dancin' from the end
of a rope.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.362
Jesus.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.674
Stop! Stop!

27:12.718 --> 27:14.850
Stop fuckin' movin'! Now!

27:17.505 --> 27:19.420
All right, now listen to me.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.161
I've had enough
of these cheap shots.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.685
I did the honorable thing.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.078
I gave myself up.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.688
I've been nothin' but calm,
courteous, and kind,

27:26.732 --> 27:28.559
and I expect a measure
of the same, that's all.

27:30.431 --> 27:31.867
Or is that too much to ask?

27:32.868 --> 27:35.001
Let him go
or I'll put you down.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.786
Yeah, well...

27:39.745 --> 27:41.050
Well, no one's gonna find
where I hid

27:41.094 --> 27:43.009
that stolen bank loot,
now, are they?

27:45.925 --> 27:47.578
Some prices are worth payin'.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.156
-God damn it.
-Ease off.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.418
I will kill
that son of a bitch.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.333
Finish tyin' him.
Come on, now!

28:03.377 --> 28:04.378
Get a move on.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.729
-Dear God.
- Now I'm playin' with you.

28:07.773 --> 28:08.991
Come on.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.298
Phew.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.909
Go get the horses.

28:25.355 --> 28:26.835
He's bleedin' real bad.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.058
You need to put
more pressure on it.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.234
He's gonna bleed out.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.846
Get your ass back on that tree
or I'll end you, son!

28:40.022 --> 28:41.763
All right, we're gonna get
you on that horse, okay?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.069
All right.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.157
Come on.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.031
FIELDS: Oh, the, um...

28:49.075 --> 28:51.512
The blue bottle,
if you please, sir.

28:51.555 --> 28:52.600
Yes, sir.

28:57.213 --> 29:00.042
Ah.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.001
My own personal supply.

29:05.395 --> 29:06.396
Very good.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.789
Mmm.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.184
Mmm.

29:15.057 --> 29:18.408
It was a pleasure making your
acquaintance, Mr. Walsh.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.116
Night's comin'.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.335
So is the cold.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.035
You'll need these.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.434
Best you gather up some wood
before night.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.306
And you might need this too.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.352
For rattlers.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.106
Last thing.

30:04.150 --> 30:07.283
He's got a $10,000 bounty
on his head.

30:07.327 --> 30:10.852
When we come back,
and he's gone or dead,

30:10.896 --> 30:15.204
well, there'll be
a hanging either way.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.423
You understand?

30:22.342 --> 30:23.691
God damn it.

30:39.533 --> 30:40.621
Well,

30:43.276 --> 30:44.407
here we are.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.847
Coyote and a horse.

32:15.890 --> 32:18.197
That's some expert
marksmanship right there.

32:25.247 --> 32:29.382
You know, you should dig up
whoever's rottin' over there.

32:29.425 --> 32:31.514
Give yourself another
bodyguard, I don't know...

32:32.907 --> 32:35.779
Maybe enough of 'em
will frighten away my men.

32:36.955 --> 32:40.610
Point is, my men are comin'.

32:40.654 --> 32:44.005
Now, you'll think it's a call
of a bird or rustle of a deer.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.050
That's them comin'.

32:46.747 --> 32:49.619
Well, they're gonna
tear you apart and eat ya.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.669
You know, those white folk
ain't comin' back.

32:57.671 --> 32:59.978
You run away,
they'll just hunt you down.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.545
You got nowhere to go.

33:03.633 --> 33:07.202
You and me,
we're stuck together now.

33:08.290 --> 33:10.292
They left you to the wolves.

33:11.772 --> 33:12.991
The dark is comin'.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.143
You fuckin' give me
those keys now.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.191
Give me
those fuckin' keys now!

33:43.717 --> 33:45.197
These keys right here?

33:47.503 --> 33:48.765
I want the keys.

33:48.809 --> 33:49.810
All right.

34:02.388 --> 34:03.824
White boy.

34:05.956 --> 34:08.263
Don't you ever, in your life,
put your hands on me.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.703
Don't ever put your hands
on me again.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.270
Don't even attempt it.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.041
You know,
I fought for your kind.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.652
In the war.

34:49.696 --> 34:50.871
My kind?

34:52.046 --> 34:54.788
I was at Fort Wagner.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.050
I fought shoulder to shoulder

34:56.094 --> 34:58.139
with the Massachusetts
Colored Regiment.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.706
I was there.

34:59.749 --> 35:00.924
Bullshit.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.840
You know, I never understood

35:03.884 --> 35:05.799
why your people
just accepted it.

35:07.148 --> 35:10.499
Why they just didn't rise up
and burn the world down.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.501
White boy,
you the one in chains.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.596
You think them heroes

35:20.640 --> 35:21.858
are gonna share
my bounty with you?

35:21.902 --> 35:23.208
I don't think so.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.906
Hell no, you're here
under threat of hanging.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.215
You're sure hoping
they don't discover

35:30.258 --> 35:31.868
what's in your britches.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.221
Did you hear what I said?

35:40.181 --> 35:42.792
Did you hear what I said?

35:42.836 --> 35:44.403
How you feel about that, huh?

35:46.709 --> 35:48.015
Just 'cause they don't
wanna look at you

35:48.058 --> 35:50.278
don't mean I can't see.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.367
Miss!

35:53.803 --> 35:56.415
Missus? I don't know
what you want me to call you!

35:57.155 --> 35:58.808
You're a sideshow freak!

36:01.159 --> 36:02.421
Now, I won't
fuckin' stand for this.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.466
I'm Tommy fuckin' Walsh!

36:06.381 --> 36:08.688
Now, this is bullshit!
You let me go!

36:10.429 --> 36:12.082
Come on,
you think you're innocent?

36:12.126 --> 36:13.823
I don't think so.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.738
You sittin' on the back
of that wagon

36:15.782 --> 36:18.132
where I saw you,
without a fight,

36:18.176 --> 36:19.438
you know what I think?

36:19.481 --> 36:21.614
I think that condemns
your kind.

36:22.441 --> 36:23.877
How you feel about that?

36:24.921 --> 36:26.445
Now, you may think
that you're free.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.794
You may think that.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.754
But you'll always be a slave
to the white man's biddin'.

36:31.798 --> 36:32.799
That's the truth.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.374
What'd you call me?

36:42.417 --> 36:44.027
I said you'll always
be a slave...

36:44.071 --> 36:45.333
What'd you call me?

36:45.377 --> 36:46.682
I said you'll always
be a slave

36:46.726 --> 36:48.249
- to the white man's biddin'.
- What'd you say?

36:49.207 --> 36:50.643
What'd you say?

36:50.686 --> 36:51.861
Say it again!

36:51.905 --> 36:53.211
Say it again!

36:54.255 --> 36:56.344
Say it again.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.477
Tired of you running
your mouth.

36:58.520 --> 37:02.045
Till you been on this side,
keep your mouth shut.

37:03.743 --> 37:06.876
Every step, y'all wanna bring
us down like we're dyin' dogs.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.750
You ever see a white man
kill your folks?

37:14.406 --> 37:15.929
Hang a Black man from a tree

37:15.972 --> 37:18.236
because he's in a wrong place
at a wrong time?

37:22.022 --> 37:23.197
You ever see that?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.286
No, didn't see that.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.593
- No.
- Did not see that.

37:27.636 --> 37:29.725
Wanna see it?

37:29.769 --> 37:31.205
- I don't wanna see...
- You wanna see?

37:31.249 --> 37:32.293
I didn't see that.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.864
Look, there it is!

37:37.907 --> 37:39.953
You ever seen a Black man hang
from that tree?

37:39.996 --> 37:42.608
For lookin' at a white woman
he didn't look at?

37:43.783 --> 37:45.872
Or for tryin' to learn
how to read?

37:48.527 --> 37:50.180
Can't complain.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.314
We gotta be grateful.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.446
Grateful.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.144
Grateful!

37:57.187 --> 37:58.711
We gotta be grateful.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.409
- Grateful.
- Yes, ma'am.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.803
For the blisters on our hands.

38:03.846 --> 38:08.111
And our empty bellies,
and our broken spirits.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.984
'Cause they'd rather hang me
for the color of my skin

38:11.027 --> 38:13.726
than to hang you
for what you did!

38:13.769 --> 38:15.989
You ain't never gonna hang,
white boy!

38:16.032 --> 38:17.686
You hear me?

39:18.530 --> 39:20.706
I mean no offense...

39:26.929 --> 39:28.104
All right, get up.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.326
Real turtle like.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.895
We're goin' for a walk.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.114
Get my Bible,

39:39.202 --> 39:41.161
and find the stagecoach
that you robbed.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.205
Yes, ma'am.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.347
You know, we can't
just walk outta here.

39:54.479 --> 39:55.741
This is Comanche country.

39:57.046 --> 39:59.266
No Bible is that important.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.789
Keep walking.

40:33.082 --> 40:35.171
You've gotta
hope it don't snow.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.436
It's gonna dump on us.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.135
If it does, I'll, uh...

40:43.832 --> 40:45.181
I'll dig you out,

40:45.225 --> 40:46.574
haul you back up the hill

40:46.618 --> 40:48.881
and I'll bury you
by the cross back at the tree.

40:49.882 --> 40:51.536
So you ain't alone.

40:53.712 --> 40:55.191
How has nobody taken a bullet

40:55.235 --> 40:58.499
and put it through your throat
to shut you up?

40:58.543 --> 41:00.414
They've tried,
and they're gonna try again.

41:01.502 --> 41:02.721
But, uh...

41:02.764 --> 41:05.114
Nah, the thing
of being a hero...

41:05.158 --> 41:07.421
You know,
about the main thing,

41:07.465 --> 41:09.249
we ought to know when to die.

41:09.292 --> 41:11.164
Prolonged life...

41:11.207 --> 41:13.209
It's ruined more men
than it ever made.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.694
Hey!

41:25.483 --> 41:27.485
I do hope you find your Bible.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.532
I can see it means
somethin' to you.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.581
Know any hymns?

41:39.540 --> 41:42.195
<i>Oh, sister</i>

41:42.238 --> 41:45.154
<i>Let's go down</i>

41:45.198 --> 41:47.853
<i>Let's go down</i>

41:47.896 --> 41:50.333
<i>Come on down</i>

41:51.944 --> 41:54.947
<i>Oh, sister</i>

41:55.991 --> 41:58.211
<i>Let's go down</i>

42:00.343 --> 42:03.608
<i>Down to the river to pray</i>

42:05.740 --> 42:08.613
<i>Oh, sinner</i>

42:08.656 --> 42:11.050
<i>Let's go down</i>

42:11.833 --> 42:13.487
<i>Let's go down</i>

42:14.096 --> 42:16.577
<i>Come on down</i>

42:16.621 --> 42:19.101
- Hey! Hey!
<i>- Oh, sinner</i>

42:20.929 --> 42:21.974
Come back here!

42:24.890 --> 42:26.500
Come back here!

42:27.980 --> 42:29.111
Hey!

42:39.034 --> 42:40.732
Shit.

43:48.887 --> 43:49.931
Take it easy now.

43:51.237 --> 43:53.152
He means it.
I think he means it.

43:56.329 --> 43:57.373
I think he means it.

43:57.417 --> 43:58.679
I think he means it now.

43:58.723 --> 43:59.811
He means it.

43:59.854 --> 44:01.073
What the hell you doing, girl?

44:01.116 --> 44:02.161
Shoot him!

44:04.380 --> 44:05.643
Hmm?

47:45.123 --> 47:47.168
You gonna tell me
what that paper was?

47:49.170 --> 47:50.563
Now that it's gone?

48:00.529 --> 48:01.791
Gold claim.

48:05.186 --> 48:08.407
Piece of land I had
to build a town for my people.

48:08.450 --> 48:09.756
A gold claim?

48:10.800 --> 48:12.890
Who'd you kill for that?

48:15.762 --> 48:19.026
I wanna understand how
a woman, such as yourself...

48:19.070 --> 48:20.549
Black woman.

48:20.593 --> 48:21.942
Yeah.

48:21.986 --> 48:23.596
Who's hiding as a man

48:25.467 --> 48:27.339
just buys a gold claim.

48:28.122 --> 48:29.471
How's that possible?

48:33.736 --> 48:37.218
After the war, I couldn't find
none of my family but my mom.

48:39.003 --> 48:40.830
She went home to be with God.

48:41.831 --> 48:43.529
Find peace in death.

48:44.878 --> 48:47.576
Made a promise in my heart
that I'll honor her.

48:50.275 --> 48:53.887
Fight for those that can't
fight for themselves.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.019
Where's your getaway?

48:55.062 --> 48:56.542
You goin' home?

48:56.585 --> 48:58.805
I wasn't gonna go back
to my master's house,

48:58.848 --> 49:01.025
that's for sure.

49:01.068 --> 49:02.940
So I put two and two together,
and just figured

49:02.983 --> 49:04.854
that I'll go cook and clean

49:04.898 --> 49:07.640
for them Union boys
that set me free.

49:13.602 --> 49:15.953
I spent four years
watching them soldiers.

49:18.172 --> 49:20.435
How they walk, how they talk.

49:23.221 --> 49:25.527
Learnt everything I needed
to know about them.

49:27.529 --> 49:30.054
When they needed
people to sign up,

49:30.097 --> 49:32.317
I just cut my hair,
bought some clothes,

49:32.360 --> 49:34.275
and walked on
to the army base.

49:36.103 --> 49:38.366
Guess nobody was
paying attention that day...

49:41.717 --> 49:44.068
and signed up
and picked up a uniform.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.770
Uniform made me feel free.

49:50.813 --> 49:53.207
I ain't never been that free
in my whole life.

49:55.209 --> 49:59.170
I had food, clothing,
money in my pocket.

50:02.216 --> 50:05.350
Soon enough, they sent us
out here to kill people

50:05.393 --> 50:08.048
that are couple shades
lighter than me.

50:08.092 --> 50:09.832
So I left.

50:09.876 --> 50:12.052
Took my money
and bought that claim.

50:15.273 --> 50:18.232
Lot of folks was depending
on that claim.

50:22.541 --> 50:24.021
You know, I knew it.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.548
You have that look
of a soldier.

50:30.940 --> 50:33.421
That look of not being able
to unsee things.

50:35.858 --> 50:38.687
I had never met no white boy
that could speak Comanche.

50:44.128 --> 50:45.651
My wife was Injun.

50:48.654 --> 50:49.785
Your wife was what?

50:49.829 --> 50:51.700
My wife was Injun.

50:57.445 --> 50:59.056
- You got a wife?
- Had.

51:03.538 --> 51:05.975
I had a kid, too.

51:10.241 --> 51:12.156
You know, humankind, uh,

51:13.374 --> 51:14.810
can be awfully unkind

51:14.854 --> 51:16.508
if it deems
that you don't belong.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.601
So now, you wanna
take revenge on the world?

51:25.821 --> 51:26.909
Well...

51:28.476 --> 51:31.784
I've been out for revenge on
the world since I was eight.

51:31.827 --> 51:33.742
Yeah.

51:33.786 --> 51:35.092
Cattle barons.

51:36.441 --> 51:37.659
They came in, they took

51:37.703 --> 51:38.965
my dad and brother
from the dinner table.

51:39.008 --> 51:40.749
They shot 'em
'cause they wanted our land.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.452
It's how I got this.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.197
Made Ma sign it over
right there

51:53.240 --> 51:55.373
before we even finished
saying the blessing.

51:57.331 --> 51:59.333
I know we all got
bad stories to tell,

51:59.377 --> 52:02.293
but not everybody takes it out
on the world like you.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.820
"An eye for an eye,"
that's what I say.

52:15.436 --> 52:17.134
You know,

52:19.614 --> 52:21.921
it looks like we believe
in the same thing.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.667
I guess so.

52:30.538 --> 52:33.498
We just go about it
in different ways.

52:33.541 --> 52:35.543
Let's go about it together.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.983
Now, since your gold
is gone,

52:42.724 --> 52:45.466
how about we strike a deal?

52:45.510 --> 52:47.468
Now, you see,
that loot from the bank...

52:50.079 --> 52:52.647
I'm the only one
who knows where it is.

52:55.128 --> 52:56.477
You let me go.

52:56.521 --> 52:57.870
I dig it up.

52:59.132 --> 53:01.090
We split it
right down the middle.

53:03.136 --> 53:04.224
Right down the middle.

53:07.967 --> 53:09.838
White boy, you crazy.

53:10.448 --> 53:11.492
That's dirty money.

53:11.536 --> 53:12.754
Oh, come on,
all money's dirty.

53:12.798 --> 53:14.408
All money's dirty.

53:14.452 --> 53:16.671
That's not what it's about.

53:17.933 --> 53:19.631
It's about bein' free.

53:21.110 --> 53:23.025
You think money
makes you free?

53:25.289 --> 53:28.640
What is it to gain the whole
world but lose your soul?

53:29.945 --> 53:31.556
Being free is having faith.

53:31.599 --> 53:33.558
- My faith is my freedom.
- Oh, no, come on.

53:33.601 --> 53:35.212
Come on, come on.

53:35.255 --> 53:37.257
No.

53:37.301 --> 53:39.738
That's just more people
telling you what to do,

53:39.781 --> 53:41.870
telling you how to think,
all the time.

53:41.914 --> 53:43.394
Always, always.

53:43.437 --> 53:45.613
You can't do nothin'.

53:45.657 --> 53:47.833
That's all it is.

53:47.876 --> 53:49.313
Money!

53:51.793 --> 53:53.099
Money.

53:55.406 --> 53:58.713
No matter
how much money you get,

53:58.757 --> 54:02.413
your heart's gonna still be
in the same place.

54:02.761 --> 54:03.979
Lonely,

54:04.328 --> 54:05.590
sad,

54:06.373 --> 54:07.592
broken.

54:09.637 --> 54:11.900
You ain't never gonna be free
on the inside.

54:13.989 --> 54:15.948
That's when you know
you're free.

54:19.386 --> 54:22.171
We... Listen to me now.

54:22.215 --> 54:25.087
Mo. You listen to me now.

54:25.131 --> 54:26.263
We deserve it.

54:27.699 --> 54:29.048
I'm listenin' to you.

54:29.091 --> 54:30.702
- Why should I trust you?
- I'm listenin' to you.

54:30.745 --> 54:32.051
- Why should I trust you?
- Listen.

54:32.094 --> 54:34.053
Look at the shit
that we've been through.

54:36.185 --> 54:38.449
Don't you think
we fuckin' deserve it?

54:42.801 --> 54:43.845
It's out here?

54:43.889 --> 54:45.194
Oh, yeah.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.720
It's right here,
you can see it from here.

54:50.678 --> 54:52.332
Imagine.

54:53.942 --> 54:56.771
$40,000.

54:59.948 --> 55:01.080
It's ours.

55:04.605 --> 55:06.520
You just gotta let me go.

55:12.134 --> 55:13.353
Show me where it is first.

55:13.397 --> 55:15.834
No, no, no.

55:15.877 --> 55:17.749
So you can shoot me in the
head and take it for yourself?

55:17.792 --> 55:19.664
Come on, I don't think so.

55:19.707 --> 55:21.666
No, no, no, no, no.

55:24.756 --> 55:26.801
You make a deal
with the Devil,

55:28.673 --> 55:31.415
you follow Devil's rules.

55:33.373 --> 55:35.157
Deal with the Devil?

55:35.201 --> 55:36.985
That's right. You and me.

55:38.422 --> 55:39.901
You and me.

55:41.163 --> 55:43.296
I don't make
those kind of deals.

55:48.475 --> 55:49.476
Hello?

55:51.173 --> 55:52.827
Who's out there?

55:54.742 --> 55:56.265
Hey, you come on now.
You show yourself!

55:56.309 --> 55:57.397
Shut up.

55:57.441 --> 55:59.268
Come on.
Come here.

56:01.836 --> 56:03.664
- Those your boys? Huh?
- They are not my boys.

56:03.708 --> 56:05.492
They never walk up
just flappin' their jaws.

56:05.536 --> 56:07.015
Hello?

56:07.059 --> 56:09.975
Just a friend.
Here to help.

56:11.150 --> 56:13.108
You know him?

56:13.152 --> 56:14.196
Do you know him?

56:14.240 --> 56:15.284
I never seen him before
in my life.

56:17.809 --> 56:19.114
Don't move.

56:26.774 --> 56:28.559
Gal, what you doing out here?

56:29.386 --> 56:30.691
Who are you?

56:31.300 --> 56:33.259
My name's Will Clay.

56:43.269 --> 56:45.314
Take your gun off and toss it.

56:45.358 --> 56:47.752
- Now, wait, a man's gun is...
-Take off your gun!

56:51.320 --> 56:53.061
Of course.

56:53.105 --> 56:54.672
Do it real slow.

56:55.934 --> 56:57.631
I'll go as slow
as I can now.

57:07.598 --> 57:09.730
I'm here to help, friend.

57:17.695 --> 57:19.740
You all right?

57:19.784 --> 57:21.481
That your blood?

57:24.615 --> 57:26.573
Ain't none of your business.

57:26.617 --> 57:28.488
Relax.

57:28.532 --> 57:32.144
Look, I was huntin' there
down by my farm

57:32.187 --> 57:33.537
when I ran into your people.

57:33.580 --> 57:36.235
They the one told me
what happened.

57:36.278 --> 57:40.457
I just grabbed two of my horse
and set out to help.

57:42.197 --> 57:44.286
They ain't tell me nothin'
about no gal, though.

57:47.420 --> 57:49.770
You got them white folk
thinkin' you a man.

57:54.819 --> 57:58.692
The man that got shot,
he all right?

58:00.172 --> 58:01.913
The big one
taking care of him.

58:02.870 --> 58:04.698
I think he'll make it.

58:04.742 --> 58:07.527
You don't look dressed
for buck huntin'.

58:07.571 --> 58:10.051
You don't look dressed for
buck huntin' or even farmin'.

58:10.878 --> 58:12.227
Yeah, you got me there.

58:12.271 --> 58:14.621
Yeah, I do.

58:14.665 --> 58:17.102
Embarrassed to admit it,
but truth is, uh,

58:17.145 --> 58:18.712
I changed my clothes

58:18.756 --> 58:22.281
when I heard you was bringin'
in the infamous Tommy Walsh.

58:23.282 --> 58:26.503
Hmm. That's him, ain't it?

58:26.546 --> 58:31.377
I, uh, thought somebody might
be here to take my picture.

58:31.420 --> 58:32.770
I ain't never had
my picture taken before.

58:32.813 --> 58:34.685
Ain't no negro
farmin' around here.

58:34.728 --> 58:35.903
None.

58:39.037 --> 58:40.647
Where you from?

58:41.822 --> 58:44.521
He sure do ask a lot
of questions, don't he?

58:44.564 --> 58:46.566
I say you shoot him now,
before he takes us out.

58:46.610 --> 58:49.090
I'm telling you,
you shoot him now.

59:16.248 --> 59:17.945
Just like I thought.

59:19.643 --> 59:21.558
The Good Lord
done brought us together.

59:24.386 --> 59:26.084
Givin' you a friend
in tryin' times,

59:26.127 --> 59:28.565
and givin' us an opportunity.

59:29.174 --> 59:32.133
Opportunity?

59:32.177 --> 59:35.093
I bet there's a nice little
bounty on this here killer.

59:36.921 --> 59:38.444
Dead or alive.

59:39.706 --> 59:41.752
Now, I say
we put him on my horse

59:41.795 --> 59:42.970
and go back to the farm.

59:43.014 --> 59:45.538
We'll be safe there.

59:45.582 --> 59:48.149
I even got a brand new
can of coffee.

59:49.324 --> 59:51.675
We could ride off
in the morning

59:51.718 --> 59:52.763
and collect
the bounty together.

59:52.806 --> 59:53.938
Don't you trust him.

59:55.722 --> 59:57.115
He ain't no farmer.
He don't live around here.

59:57.158 --> 59:58.899
He ain't makin' no coffee.

59:59.857 --> 01:00:01.815
And since you're
the man in charge,

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:03.251
you take 70%...

01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:04.644
God damn it, you take
these chains off of me.

01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:06.298
You're as dead as I am.
You listening to me?

01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:09.040
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.215
Don't you...

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.913
Don't you do it.

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:14.698
Don't you do it.
Don't you listen to him.

01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:26.318
I, uh...

01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:31.453
I had a daughter,
about your age now.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.766
And if she was here...

01:00:44.771 --> 01:00:47.078
I would ask her
what kinda predicament

01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.775
she get herself into.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:56.087
Then, I would help
her figure a way out.

01:00:57.392 --> 01:01:00.700
'Cause, baby girl,
you in dangerous water,

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:03.398
pushing away
the only boat you got.

01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:26.160
I don't know what to do.

01:01:27.858 --> 01:01:32.123
Well, I know he got that loot
stashed around here somewhere.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:36.780
I got ways to make him talk.

01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:38.956
You and I
could walk away rich.

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:42.699
Be a shame to let the law put
their hands on that 120 grand.

01:01:44.657 --> 01:01:47.486
$120,000?

01:01:47.529 --> 01:01:48.748
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.533
Bank got robbed same day

01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:54.014
the Union Pacific
deposited payroll.

01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:00.760
You stole $120,000?

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:02.893
Hide it out here?

01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:07.245
You told me to trust you.

01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:12.380
You can't trust nobody.

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.123
Trust me.

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.735
Trust your own kind.

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:20.737
It's all you got.

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.828
Look...

01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:31.095
I'm here for a reason.

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:43.803
You think that man's
gonna make it?

01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:46.414
Absolutely.

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:47.807
Got the best doctor in town.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.200
What's his name?

01:02:49.548 --> 01:02:50.592
Woolsey.

01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:53.378
Come on, man.

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.773
Woolsey, yeah.
You made that up!

01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:58.339
- Used to labor for him.
- Yeah, you're full of shit!

01:02:58.383 --> 01:02:59.427
You made it up!

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:01.168
Nice fella, he is.

01:03:01.212 --> 01:03:02.779
Wife make the best
peach pie in town.

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.477
God damn it!
He's fuckin' lyin' to you!

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.263
He's a bounty hunter!

01:03:09.307 --> 01:03:11.396
He's gonna kill you,
he's gonna kill me,

01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:12.832
just like he killed
the liquor dealer

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.616
and that big old bohunk!

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.933
We should wait
for the sheriff.

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:31.416
It's the right thing to do.

01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:35.202
You can wait with me
if you want.

01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:36.813
No. Mm-mm.

01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:40.555
Suit yourself.

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.166
I ain't sittin' around here
like no duck,

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:44.864
waitin' for his men
to come pick us off.

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:46.257
Now, look,
I said I would try to help,

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.998
but I ain't riskin' my life.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.651
You change your mind,

01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:51.523
my farm is four miles away
from here.

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:58.443
I'd appreciate
you givin' my gun back.

01:03:58.486 --> 01:04:00.880
Don't you dare.

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:03.187
Don't you dare give him
that gun back now.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.449
God damn it.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.192
Don't you do it.

01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:12.152
Oh, fuck.

01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:19.507
Well...

01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:22.510
good luck, gal.

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.818
You gonna need it.

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.867
Yeah, you go on now.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:32.259
Go on.

01:04:33.347 --> 01:04:36.133
Fuckin' huntin'
and fuckin' farmin'.

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:38.222
Go on.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.748
Wait.

01:04:50.408 --> 01:04:53.890
I ain't never met you
before in my life,

01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:55.979
but your story's addin' up.

01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.765
You mean everything you said?

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:05.553
Got the same scars,
you and me.

01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:08.295
You got your forty acre?

01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:10.167
A mule?

01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:12.343
You feel free?

01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:15.824
I sure as hell don't.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:22.005
If I leave him with you,

01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:24.007
you let me take
one of your horses.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.269
Hey, hey.

01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:26.531
Hey, wait.

01:05:28.707 --> 01:05:30.013
You gonna leave me?

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:34.495
You gonna let me go out
at the hands of him?

01:05:34.539 --> 01:05:36.628
You're the reason
why we're right here.

01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:39.587
Now you talkin'.

01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.850
Sound like a good idea to me.

01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:43.417
In fact, I'll unchain him.

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:44.636
No. No.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.246
I don't think so.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.552
I'll do it.

01:05:48.683 --> 01:05:49.728
I'll do it.

01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:50.903
Yeah, suit yourself.

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.297
What're you waitin' on?

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.081
Go over here
and have me a drink.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.909
I can use one
after this damn night.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.302
Hey, listen to me.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.218
Take the gun.

01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:03.437
Hey. Look at me, look at me.

01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:07.050
You listen to me now.
You listen to me now.

01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:09.182
Stop, stop. Listen.
Listen to me.

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:10.357
No.

01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:11.706
Listen to me.

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:14.666
I know killers.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.150
He'll kill us both,
I swear to you.

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:28.071
Mmm.

01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:30.116
Mr. Field!

01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:34.381
Some damn good whiskey.

01:06:36.905 --> 01:06:38.864
Don't worry,
I'll save you some, darlin'.

01:06:40.474 --> 01:06:42.694
For the celebration.

01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:52.269
You kill those people?

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:53.661
Those people,
they care nothin' about us.

01:06:53.705 --> 01:06:54.967
Go on, you shoot him. Go on.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.316
Put it down.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.796
I've been huntin' him
for five months,

01:06:57.839 --> 01:06:59.537
and I ain't
lettin' him get away.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.060
Come on, he's gonna kill you.
You shoot him!

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.279
You ain't nothin'
but a murderer

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:03.367
and a goddamn liar!

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.151
So are you.

01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:08.415
Them people got
in my goddamn way!

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.113
I don't know how long
I can hold off

01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:12.115
my desire
to blow your head off.

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:13.551
Come on.

01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:18.556
Ain't nobody gettin' in
the way of what's owed to me.

01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:21.124
Least of all you.

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.951
So, you just gonna
have to kill me.

01:07:22.995 --> 01:07:24.866
Come on, you pull it!

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:32.004
Your bullets in the field.

01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:36.400
On your left!

01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:37.792
Shoot her!

01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.800
Come here.
Come here now.

01:07:45.844 --> 01:07:47.367
Come here.

01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:50.196
Should've listened to me, huh?

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.242
-Come on! Come on!
-Should've come with me.

01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:53.895
Come on, get up.

01:07:53.939 --> 01:07:56.463
Shit. Hey!

01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:04.645
You a fuckin' killer?

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.271
Cut him down!
Cut him, God damn it.

01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:22.881
Cut him!

01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:31.933
Come on now!

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.675
Come on, get up!

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:35.894
I'll kill you!

01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:36.938
Here!

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:40.812
Oh, shit!

01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:17.561
You should've trusted me.

01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:21.739
Now, I know
why you did what you did,

01:10:21.782 --> 01:10:23.306
and I just wish
that you didn't.

01:10:29.137 --> 01:10:30.965
I wanted to trust him.

01:10:35.013 --> 01:10:36.928
He reminded me of my father.

01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:41.759
Everybody around you
ends up dead, don't they?

01:10:54.902 --> 01:10:56.252
This is your fault.

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:59.342
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.735
No.

01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:05.478
Death follows you, don't it?

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.960
It follows you.

01:11:09.003 --> 01:11:11.005
Whether you like it or not,
there it is.

01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:15.532
You think when you get
where you're going,

01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:17.273
it's just gonna disappear?

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.667
You gonna trade in
that six shooter for a dress?

01:11:22.843 --> 01:11:24.323
No.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:27.370
That imposter will always
be knockin' at your door.

01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:30.373
It will find you
wherever you go.

01:11:32.853 --> 01:11:34.551
Now, you trust me now.

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.945
I know.

01:11:51.655 --> 01:11:53.787
It won't be long now.

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:56.050
My men are coming.

01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:00.185
It's in their best interest,
of course.

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:02.666
I know things they wanna know.

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:06.234
They're gonna shoot me
just as fast as shoot you

01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:08.759
if I don't give 'em
what they want.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.415
And I think you best
unchain me now.

01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:23.164
- Follow you or die?
- Huh.

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:25.384
I can't stop
what's about to happen.

01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:32.130
You're right.

01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:33.305
Yeah.

01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:36.003
Yeah.

01:12:36.047 --> 01:12:38.310
Being a soldier
is deep in my blood.

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:43.837
I was the best damn soldier
in that battlefield.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.753
Better than any man.

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.062
But I had to learn
as a Black woman

01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:53.238
livin' in this
damn white world...

01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:57.416
that I gotta work
three times as hard

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.939
to get one-fifth
of what I deserve,

01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:01.028
and I'm tired of it.

01:13:05.337 --> 01:13:08.166
You gonna make me fight for
my life and prove that to you?

01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:12.953
Fine.

01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:20.613
Watch me set you
and your boys alight.

01:15:27.435 --> 01:15:29.046
Oh, no.

01:15:29.089 --> 01:15:31.178
Not Dakota. Oh...

01:15:32.049 --> 01:15:33.616
Oh, Dakota.

01:15:33.659 --> 01:15:36.749
Oh, boy.
I done you wrong, boy.

01:15:37.576 --> 01:15:39.317
I done you wrong.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.493
Tommy. Tommy!

01:15:43.364 --> 01:15:46.324
We thought they took you
to the Brushwood Gulch.

01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:48.935
Tommy.

01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:50.415
Tommy.

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:51.590
- Tommy.
-Where is she?

01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:53.244
-She?
-Where is she?

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:55.420
-She?
- She's gonna kill us.

01:15:55.463 --> 01:15:56.900
She?

01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:00.425
Well, she killed Rufus
and Halfbreed.

01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:02.383
And Dakota, too.

01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:03.820
What the hell
you doin' here, huh?

01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:05.125
Me go get that bitch!

01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:06.387
No! No, Pike.

01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:08.259
Pike. Hold on, Pike.

01:16:08.302 --> 01:16:11.741
Pike, look what she done.

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.147
- Nah, you face her!
-Hey! Get up.

01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:28.366
You go and face her right now!

01:16:28.409 --> 01:16:30.194
I swear to God,
she gonna kill you!

01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:31.325
Go on!

01:16:32.762 --> 01:16:33.763
She...

01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:36.635
She went that way.

01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:39.333
Both of you guys,
you get after her right now!

01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:40.770
You want your money?

01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:42.598
You bring her back to me!

01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:44.208
I've had it with you!

01:16:44.251 --> 01:16:46.950
You don't know
the fuck you're dealing with!

01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.255
I know!

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:51.955
I've been here!

01:16:51.998 --> 01:16:54.087
Come on, you get these chains
off me now. Come on.

01:16:55.654 --> 01:16:57.134
Hurry up now.

01:16:58.091 --> 01:16:59.658
Come on...

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.404
Thomas, let's get the loot

01:17:06.447 --> 01:17:07.710
and get outta here.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.059
The hell are you doin'?

01:17:09.102 --> 01:17:10.147
I quit.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.322
The hell are you doin'?

01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:13.977
I waited six months already.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.544
That girl don't matter.

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:21.593
Just give me what's due,
and I'm gone.

01:17:22.812 --> 01:17:24.465
It's comin' to ya.

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:25.466
Yeah?

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:27.686
It's comin' to ya.

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:29.906
Is that a promise this time?

01:17:29.949 --> 01:17:31.864
On my life.

01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:33.387
All right.

01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:50.404
Ah, shit.

01:17:50.448 --> 01:17:51.841
Come here, buddy.

01:17:51.884 --> 01:17:54.017
Here's your hat.

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:56.193
Come here, Thomas.

01:17:56.236 --> 01:17:57.498
Thattaboy.

01:17:58.108 --> 01:17:59.500
Put that on you now.

01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:01.241
Let me see ya.

01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:02.765
You look all right.

01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:06.333
I'll get your gun.

01:18:12.035 --> 01:18:13.427
That's a nice gun, Thomas.

01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:14.559
Yeah.

01:18:14.602 --> 01:18:16.082
- You'll have to clean it.
- Well...

01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:20.696
You didn't remember
to bring the shovels.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.406
You out there, little lady?

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:37.277
Huh?

01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:15.489
She's sneaky.

01:19:45.432 --> 01:19:46.999
Hey.

01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:49.088
You go on,
and I'm gonna circle around.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.636
We know you're here!

01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:22.486
Tuco!

01:21:25.924 --> 01:21:27.360
Tuco!

01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:33.671
Where you at?

01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:38.197
Huh?

01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:42.027
Where you at, soldier girl?

01:22:13.232 --> 01:22:14.364
Get up.

01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:18.150
Oh, look at you.

01:22:18.585 --> 01:22:19.586
Come here.

01:22:20.413 --> 01:22:22.198
Get up here!

01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:31.468
Oh, what are you
gonna do with that, huh?

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.078
Huh?

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.032
You know,

01:23:59.164 --> 01:24:00.513
I really thought

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.691
that you'd have sympathized
with a man in chains.

01:24:06.258 --> 01:24:09.305
Brutalized by the world same
way that it brutalized you,

01:24:12.786 --> 01:24:14.571
but I must have misjudged you.

01:24:18.966 --> 01:24:21.491
You set your boys on me
to take my life.

01:24:21.534 --> 01:24:23.536
Well, you know what?
You killed all of 'em.

01:24:24.363 --> 01:24:26.104
Just you and me now.

01:24:26.148 --> 01:24:28.846
I'mma fight for my life
by any means necessary.

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:34.156
We ain't got no future apart.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.594
We don't.

01:24:37.637 --> 01:24:39.857
You got nothin'.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.902
All I got is the gallows,
that's it.

01:24:43.904 --> 01:24:45.863
Now, you listen to me now.

01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:49.519
Together, I think
we could be something.

01:24:49.562 --> 01:24:51.695
I mean, we could be
something that's important,

01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:53.218
that means something.

01:24:54.306 --> 01:24:56.178
We could be more than this!

01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.049
More than this!

01:24:59.311 --> 01:25:00.530
You and me.

01:25:00.573 --> 01:25:02.227
Tommy Walsh!

01:25:02.271 --> 01:25:05.230
Tommy Walsh
and the Colored Girl.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.319
God damn!

01:25:07.363 --> 01:25:09.321
That's not a headline
you heard before.

01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:11.106
It ain't.

01:25:14.674 --> 01:25:17.895
What do you think your people
will think about that, huh?

01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:22.334
And you'd be a hero!

01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:27.296
You'd be a legend
in your time!

01:25:28.775 --> 01:25:31.126
You'd be an inspiration
to them.

01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.825
The infamy, the glory of it!

01:25:35.565 --> 01:25:36.740
Can you imagine?

01:25:39.786 --> 01:25:42.049
I didn't get a piece
of my promised land.

01:25:45.705 --> 01:25:48.055
Didn't get the rivers flowin'
with milk and honey.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:52.843
And I'd never take your deal.

01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:54.975
Ah, fuck you!

01:25:55.498 --> 01:25:56.716
Come on!

01:25:58.762 --> 01:26:00.807
I've given you
everything that I got.

01:26:01.939 --> 01:26:03.897
You have
the opportunity now...

01:26:05.682 --> 01:26:08.554
to take what you deserve,
what we both deserve!

01:26:11.427 --> 01:26:13.298
You gonna have
to kill me right here.

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:25.876
I'll tell you what,
it ain't gonna be easy.

01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:29.619
No.

01:26:31.751 --> 01:26:33.884
Not after everything
that we've been through.

01:26:36.234 --> 01:26:37.192
All right.

01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:39.629
You holster it now.

01:26:42.893 --> 01:26:45.765
We gonna do this,
we're gonna holster it.

01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:50.422
Come on.

01:26:57.473 --> 01:26:58.474
There it is.

01:27:06.743 --> 01:27:08.353
You never asked me my name.

01:27:09.572 --> 01:27:10.747
You're right.

01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:13.837
I don't
even know your name.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.279
Fuck.

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.214
Wanna know my name?

01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:48.219
It's Mo Washington.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.266
That's my name.

01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:58.577
Washington.

01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:01.537
Mo Washington.

01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:06.846
I'm glad it's
at the hands of you.

01:28:08.892 --> 01:28:10.285
Let me tell you somethin'.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.593
Let me tell you somethin'.

01:28:15.986 --> 01:28:18.554
You... You know
where the money is.

01:28:20.512 --> 01:28:23.210
Your faith is your freedom.

01:28:55.547 --> 01:29:00.030
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah!</i>

01:29:02.467 --> 01:29:04.861
<i>Glory, glory...</i>

01:29:40.157 --> 01:29:41.506
Bag of nails.

01:29:45.902 --> 01:29:47.251
Lord have mercy.

01:29:48.339 --> 01:29:50.036
Too late.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.734
This one's still alive.

01:29:51.777 --> 01:29:53.083
We'll see about that.

01:29:55.999 --> 01:29:58.088
What in bloody hell
happened here, son?

01:30:03.615 --> 01:30:05.400
Tommy's boys, they...

01:30:06.705 --> 01:30:08.707
they beat me real bad.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.319
I got knocked out,
and when I woke up,

01:30:12.363 --> 01:30:14.191
all these dead bodies
were here, sir.

01:30:16.672 --> 01:30:18.413
Killed each other?

01:30:18.456 --> 01:30:20.197
Killed each other?
It's a massacre.

01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:22.068
Who are all them?

01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:27.552
That's, uh, Goldie Whitman
and Dakota Smitt,

01:30:27.596 --> 01:30:29.424
Tommy's guys.

01:30:29.467 --> 01:30:32.252
There's Tommy
and the coach driver.

01:30:32.296 --> 01:30:34.385
But I don't know
who these others are.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:37.649
Can't be nobody good
if they out here.

01:30:37.693 --> 01:30:40.870
Tommy say anything about
the money, where he hid it?

01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.788
No, sir,
he barely talked at all.

01:30:47.137 --> 01:30:48.138
Mm.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.749
You're lucky
they didn't kill ya.

01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:53.796
What ain't you telling us?

01:30:56.538 --> 01:30:59.018
Well, seems very simple to me.

01:31:01.238 --> 01:31:04.546
You got a bunch
of bad guys over here,

01:31:04.589 --> 01:31:08.027
a bunch of bad guys
over there.

01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:11.988
They turned on one another,
and then killed each other.

01:31:15.992 --> 01:31:17.472
What do you say, Sheriff?

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:19.735
They're dead.

01:31:19.778 --> 01:31:22.651
Rewards need payin',
and lives need livin'.

01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:24.304
What are you gonna do?

01:31:24.348 --> 01:31:26.785
Hang this one
just for bein' here?

01:31:27.743 --> 01:31:30.833
I'm sure he don't know
what happened.

01:31:30.876 --> 01:31:33.749
So, we ain't ever
gonna know what happened.

01:31:35.011 --> 01:31:37.013
They all got
what they deserve.

01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:41.931
You think this fella here

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.064
killed all these men?

01:31:46.196 --> 01:31:48.328
No man I know
could do all that.

01:31:54.334 --> 01:31:57.990
There's a $10,000 bounty
on Tommy Walsh's head.

01:31:59.383 --> 01:32:02.125
You got that comin' to you,
Mr. Wheeler.

01:32:02.168 --> 01:32:04.606
Do I need to bring
these men back into town?

01:32:04.649 --> 01:32:05.650
Nah.

01:32:06.433 --> 01:32:07.565
I seen 'em.

01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:11.134
I suppose, uh,

01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:14.311
some would hang ya.

01:32:14.354 --> 01:32:16.052
You suppose right, Sheriff.

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.185
But I guess it just seems...

01:32:21.057 --> 01:32:22.145
Well...

01:32:23.668 --> 01:32:28.194
it seems if there is a God
that he wanted you alive.

01:32:28.934 --> 01:32:30.936
So, just in case,

01:32:31.937 --> 01:32:33.678
I ain't gonna interfere.

01:32:36.028 --> 01:32:38.030
But you're gonna
clean up this mess.

01:32:38.074 --> 01:32:39.423
Go get a shovel.

01:32:40.424 --> 01:32:41.643
You're gonna bury
all these bodies,

01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:43.122
and then be on about your way.

01:32:44.776 --> 01:32:46.561
And be thankful for it.

01:32:50.652 --> 01:32:51.609
Yes, sir.

01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:55.178
That's it?

01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:56.309
Somewhere around here,

01:32:56.353 --> 01:32:57.702
he buried
all that stolen loot.

01:32:57.746 --> 01:32:59.399
We just gonna leave it?

01:32:59.443 --> 01:33:00.662
What are you gonna do?

01:33:00.705 --> 01:33:02.185
Dig up the whole county?

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.883
You be my guest.

01:33:04.927 --> 01:33:08.539
But the rest of you, head back
to the saloon, I'm buying.

01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:12.543
What about the bank loot,
Sheriff?

01:33:13.457 --> 01:33:16.286
Sorry, boys, you heard him.

01:33:17.504 --> 01:33:19.028
Say goodbye to the money.

01:33:26.165 --> 01:33:27.340
Good luck, fella.

01:34:47.769 --> 01:34:49.727
"The meek shall inherit
the earth."
