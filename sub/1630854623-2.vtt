WEBVTT

00:13.000 --> 00:16.458
<i>As Fjall, Éile, and Scían headed south,</i>

00:16.541 --> 00:19.916
<i>another sought vengeance</i>
<i>against the might of the Golden Empire.</i>

00:33.208 --> 00:36.708
We don't sell godhead to your kind.
Fuck off.

00:37.291 --> 00:38.583
I'm not here to smoke.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.791
Well, we haven't ordered any Dwarven quim.

00:42.541 --> 00:44.916
Did any of you lot order a Dwarven whore?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.166
I'm not a whore.

00:46.666 --> 00:49.833
But the elf I'm looking for
does have a thing for Dwarven girls.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.541
Talyysen of the One Eye.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.583
A Golden Empire sergeant.

00:53.666 --> 00:54.875
Never heard of him.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.125
You sure?

00:59.208 --> 01:01.083
Only, he was seen here a few nights ago.

01:01.166 --> 01:02.083
Look,

01:03.125 --> 01:07.416
this place is full of elves
who hate you lot just as much as I do,

01:07.500 --> 01:10.416
all high as kites and quick to battle.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.791
So do yourself a favor…

01:12.875 --> 01:15.583
…and fuck the fucking fuck off!

01:22.083 --> 01:23.166
You sure?

01:24.500 --> 01:25.875
Maybe he's not in there.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.000
Fair enough, Gwen.

01:31.916 --> 01:32.791
Good point.

01:35.458 --> 01:37.458
We'll have
a wee gander for ourselves.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.916
You little shit. How'd you get in?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.708
-Oh fuck.

01:59.833 --> 02:01.916
-Who the fuck let you--

02:03.666 --> 02:05.625
How are we this fine eve?

02:05.708 --> 02:07.000
Name's Meldof.

02:07.083 --> 02:11.500
I'm looking for Talyysen of the One Eye.
Big shit stain of an elf.

02:11.583 --> 02:13.000
-Bitch, leave.

02:17.041 --> 02:19.208
-Fuck!

02:19.291 --> 02:20.291
Whew!

02:44.125 --> 02:45.333
Don't worry, love.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.125
We'll find him.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.708
Aah.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.916
I can hear you grinding your teeth.

03:27.416 --> 03:31.166
Please don't make me drown you.
It would upset the other patrons no end.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.625
What's on your mind?

03:36.416 --> 03:38.166
The… situation

03:39.375 --> 03:41.250
in the north and south is festering.

03:41.958 --> 03:43.583
Most of the cities are ours,

03:43.666 --> 03:46.458
but there are still some holdouts
refusing the Golden Empire.

03:46.541 --> 03:48.000
Supply lines are disrupted.

03:48.083 --> 03:51.416
The merchants are taking advantage,
raising the price of grain.

03:52.708 --> 03:56.000
Then hang them on the city walls
as a lesson to others.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.125
They still control
the supply lines to the east.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.875
Hang them and we lose access
to the Dwarven steel we need

04:00.958 --> 04:02.708
for our campaigns to the new world.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.208
What would you suggest we do?

04:05.291 --> 04:06.791
Invite them over for tea?

04:07.583 --> 04:08.958
Bake them a honey cake?

04:09.041 --> 04:11.125
Arrest the guild leadership.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.916
Allow the rest of them
to continue trading under our terms.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.625
Starving citizens are
a recipe for rebellion.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.041
Try it.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.583
If it doesn't work,
there's always the honey cake.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.083
-Or the hanging.

04:23.708 --> 04:24.666
What else?

04:25.250 --> 04:27.666
Fjall and the Lark were spotted in Gaylth.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.041
I've stationed troops south of there.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.250
Won't be long.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.083
I've heard this bleating before.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.750
Are you incompetent?

04:38.833 --> 04:41.583
They're alone. They won't last long.

04:41.666 --> 04:42.791
And if they do?

04:42.875 --> 04:47.166
Two warriors who overcame
all obstacles stacked against them,

04:47.250 --> 04:49.500
bound together by destiny,
et cetera, et cetera.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.250
There's enough of a seed there

04:51.333 --> 04:54.958
to grow a powerful story
that the peasants can latch onto.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.541
A story beyond our control.

04:56.625 --> 04:59.875
Stories can be put down with steel.

04:59.958 --> 05:02.958
History is littered with fools
who believed the very same.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.458
Control the story, control the world.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.791
Put them to clay.

05:19.041 --> 05:19.958
That's Byrelle.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.291
They haven't been defeated
in a thousand years.

05:22.375 --> 05:23.375
Fuck me.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.041
Three armies united.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.791
They didn't stand a chance.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.166
It's a massacre.

05:30.916 --> 05:34.041
If we're to have any chance
in Xin'trea, we're gonna need more bodies.

05:34.708 --> 05:35.833
Sellswords.

05:37.625 --> 05:39.750
Doable. For the right coin.

05:40.916 --> 05:44.125
Daédwóde's south of here.
There's a small bank we can hit.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.291
We'll need to stay off the roads.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.500
<i>The three marched on,</i>

05:49.583 --> 05:53.666
<i>each knowing that this raid could put</i>
<i>their quest for vengeance in peril.</i>

05:54.333 --> 05:56.458
<i>But without coin for sellswords,</i>

05:56.541 --> 05:59.750
<i>they were no more than specks of dust</i>
<i>against an empire.</i>

06:10.125 --> 06:11.125
Where is everyone?

06:11.208 --> 06:13.166
Probably took to the forests
after the coup.

06:13.750 --> 06:16.875
We approach from the tree lines.
Avoid the main street.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.750
Agreed.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.833
This is risky.

06:22.791 --> 06:26.541
-No sellswords, no vengeance.
-You sure you can find them?

06:26.625 --> 06:29.208
One thing this land isn't short of
is sellswords.

06:29.291 --> 06:33.000
And thanks to you, Sword Daughter,
I've worked with nearly all of them.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.791
Let's get this done.

06:44.833 --> 06:46.083
Knock, knock!

06:58.083 --> 07:00.291
-Where's the money?

07:03.541 --> 07:06.250
You know what they say
about elves that carry big axes?

07:12.333 --> 07:16.666
Merchants and lowborn alike came
and took everythin' out after the coup.

07:17.333 --> 07:21.458
Only thing of any value in this place
seems to be you lot.

07:31.583 --> 07:32.958
Doesn't even look like me.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.250
WANTED DEAD
REWARD 1,000 OIRS

07:34.333 --> 07:35.666
What's throwing you off?

07:36.166 --> 07:37.250
The eyes.

07:39.541 --> 07:42.666
Enemies of the Golden Empire!
Toss out your weapons!

07:43.541 --> 07:44.916
We've been spotted.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.041
Where's the back door?

07:47.875 --> 07:50.875
It's a bank. One way in, one way out.

07:51.458 --> 07:52.750
Those are not conscripts.

07:53.250 --> 07:56.333
-Battle-hardened. Elite.
-Lovely.

07:57.541 --> 07:59.125
Die slowly, assholes!

08:00.250 --> 08:01.541
-Fuck.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.875
Form up on my flanks, now!

08:04.541 --> 08:06.416
Last chance to surrender!

08:11.208 --> 08:12.291
Choke them here.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.125
Fight as a clan,
and we may just make it out.

08:49.666 --> 08:52.166
Murdering bastards!

08:53.416 --> 08:54.500
Get back in formation!

09:34.000 --> 09:35.041
Not good.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.583
Fuck!

09:50.750 --> 09:52.416
We are <i>not </i>dying here!

09:56.166 --> 09:57.541
It's Dwarven steel.

09:57.625 --> 09:58.625
So is this.

10:20.083 --> 10:24.625
<i>Alone and powerless,</i>
<i>Merwyn's mind churned,</i>

10:25.208 --> 10:28.041
<i>desperate to find a way</i>
<i>to free herself of Balor's grip.</i>

10:28.125 --> 10:29.000
-Empress.
-Empress.

10:29.083 --> 10:32.458
<i>She knew he'd kill her</i>
<i>as soon as he was done with her.</i>

10:39.166 --> 10:40.500
Your Highness.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.125
The lowborn are starving…

10:48.458 --> 10:49.958
while your empire grows fat.

11:20.916 --> 11:23.125
Tastes horrible. Feels wonderful.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.458
Or at least, it… will.

11:25.541 --> 11:27.166
This should never have happened.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.750
-Who was he?
-A kitchen hand.

11:32.041 --> 11:33.083
Did he say anything?

11:33.166 --> 11:36.166
Uh, something about starving.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.416
Famine's hitting the lowborn
harder each day.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.541
Famine?

11:42.041 --> 11:45.416
I'm going to assign one of my most trusted
lieutenants as bodyguard.

11:47.000 --> 11:47.833
No.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.583
No, this one shall be my protector.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.666
He's already proven himself.

11:53.750 --> 11:54.708
What is your name?

11:55.583 --> 11:57.833
Crevan Espane aep Caomhan Macha.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.875
But most people call me Avallac'h.

12:00.958 --> 12:02.125
One wonders why.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.041
When did this famine start?

12:04.125 --> 12:08.250
I have no idea
about the world outside of these walls.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.000
I need to see for myself.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.208
Perhaps you should stay
confined to your quarters for a while.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.041
Let us handle things.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.875
For your own safety, Empress.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.125
<i>As Éile, Fjall,</i>
<i>and Scían continued south toward Xin'trea</i>

12:28.208 --> 12:30.833
<i>to hunt down everyone</i>
<i>behind the bloody coup,</i>

12:31.333 --> 12:33.500
<i>the three hunters had, themselves,</i>

12:34.625 --> 12:36.000
<i>become the hunted.</i>

12:49.375 --> 12:52.250
We need to find some herbs
before that wound turns sour.

12:52.750 --> 12:53.958
I can keep going.

12:54.833 --> 12:55.833
No, you can't.

12:56.541 --> 12:58.083
You're hurt because of me.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.458
-You need to rest.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.625
I'll go find some herbs
for a poultice.

13:15.791 --> 13:17.166
More chance with two.

13:17.958 --> 13:20.125
Go. I'll be fine.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.083
I'm not leaving you.

13:23.791 --> 13:24.708
Go.

13:25.416 --> 13:26.583
It's okay.

13:29.666 --> 13:31.083
I'll find some knitbone.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.666
You, uh… wanted to see me?

14:01.791 --> 14:03.166
You appreciate books?

14:04.833 --> 14:08.208
I spy a first edition
of Solryth's <i>Conquest of the Dwarves.</i>

14:09.708 --> 14:10.916
I knew I chose well.

14:14.416 --> 14:17.625
I have no knowledge of protection.
I'm-- I'm just an apprentice.

14:18.416 --> 14:19.416
You saved me.

14:20.541 --> 14:21.708
No. Uh…

14:22.416 --> 14:24.458
I did it without thinking.

14:24.541 --> 14:27.375
Exactly. Which means I can trust you.

14:28.666 --> 14:29.875
You're perfect.

14:29.958 --> 14:31.166
For what, exactly?

14:31.750 --> 14:34.416
To be my eyes and ears
with Balor and Eredin.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.833
I'm no spy. Truly, I'm just--

14:38.916 --> 14:41.000
As soon as the empire settles,

14:41.083 --> 14:44.666
I have no doubt
Balor and Eredin will have me killed.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.541
Probably some sad accident.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.416
And since they know
I've chosen you as my protector,

14:50.500 --> 14:52.291
they will most likely kill you too.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.250
Huh.

14:54.875 --> 14:59.708
I'm sure you'd prefer that didn't happen.
So now you are a spy.

14:59.791 --> 15:00.958
But…

15:01.625 --> 15:03.458
Balor has his eye on everything.

15:03.541 --> 15:05.958
-What if he discovers--
-I need you to steal a book from him.

15:06.041 --> 15:09.083
-What?
-Syndril's work. <i>The Book of Monoliths</i>.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.875
I need you to learn
how to open gateways to new worlds.

15:12.958 --> 15:14.000
This is insane.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.416
-I'm going to die.
-I need to control them.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.333
Do it. Give me your cloak.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.833
Why, exactly?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.541
I saw that lowborn's eyes.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.291
Where are you going?

15:31.166 --> 15:34.291
I need to know what's happening
outside these palace walls.

15:41.875 --> 15:42.791
Yeah.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.875
Yeah, I'm-- I'm definitely going to die.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.708
-Mind yourself! Wait!
-Give it back!

15:50.791 --> 15:52.250
-I got it!
-Get out!

15:52.333 --> 15:54.541
-Go on, then, show us--
-Get out the way!

15:54.625 --> 15:56.250
-Out of the way!
-Quickly!

15:56.333 --> 15:58.333
-You blind?
-Eyes open!

15:59.875 --> 16:01.666
-Send the militia!

16:01.750 --> 16:04.750
-They stole my trinkets!
-Bring that back, now!

16:06.875 --> 16:09.416
-Help, will you?
-Murder!

16:09.500 --> 16:11.791
-Oh, thank you. I'm so hungry.
-Get off!

16:11.875 --> 16:13.166
Leave it!

16:13.875 --> 16:16.000
-Get out the way!
-Mind out!

16:19.625 --> 16:22.083
Let me have some, I beg you!

16:24.916 --> 16:26.750
No, no, no,
don't you come back begging.

16:26.833 --> 16:29.625
-I'll call the soldiers on you.
-Please! I'm starving!

16:29.708 --> 16:31.500
No coin, no bread.

17:23.958 --> 17:27.291
You fucked me. You were the only one
I told of the arrests.

17:27.375 --> 17:31.666
Somehow your fellow merchants knew to flee
the cities with their grain stores.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm sorry.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.208
There was Galentrian wine
at the guild meeting, and I just…

18:07.458 --> 18:08.791
must have let it slip.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.083
You're going to get yourself killed.

18:15.625 --> 18:16.708
I'll be fine.

18:19.291 --> 18:21.500
You might be fine
being a flippant little shit,

18:21.583 --> 18:24.583
but I'd like to keep my head
attached to my fucking shoulders.

18:24.666 --> 18:26.666
Balor is tightening the noose day by day.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.250
Nothing will come back to you.

18:29.166 --> 18:30.583
No one knows about us.

18:32.958 --> 18:37.875
And, as you are so fond of reminding me,
they'd never believe it anyway.

18:39.125 --> 18:42.291
Elf like you, military class,
slumming it with a petty merchant.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.041
I didn't mean it like that.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.208
-The other night--
-It's fine.

18:48.666 --> 18:51.333
We were both very, very… drunk.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.541
Is it really that bad?

19:05.500 --> 19:08.000
Balor's just a lowborn
with a chip on his shoulder.

19:14.833 --> 19:17.708
We were going to commandeer that grain
to feed our troops.

19:18.208 --> 19:20.041
What about the palace grain stores?

19:22.041 --> 19:23.041
Nearly empty.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.625
I didn't know.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.583
And you still don't,

19:31.208 --> 19:33.500
-Galentrian wine or not.

19:36.458 --> 19:40.333
<i>And while Eredin</i>
<i>struggled to keep his beloved secret safe,</i>

19:40.875 --> 19:43.500
<i>high above those lowborn streets,</i>

19:43.583 --> 19:46.416
<i>Balor nurtured his own deadly secret.</i>

19:50.750 --> 19:54.375
I'm worried about you. You need
to be careful. What if Eredin finds out?

19:54.458 --> 19:57.708
He knows nothing
of the power of the arid world. Of her.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.750
She gave me a beast.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.375
She can give me so much more,
as soon as I give her what she wants.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.958
By the time they all realize,
it'll be too late.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.750
I'll have transformed.

20:23.666 --> 20:26.083
-Your friend is not in a good way.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.833
Who the fuck are you?

20:38.458 --> 20:42.375
Let's just say I'm one for a good story.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.208
I think that you

20:49.333 --> 20:50.666
might be the start of one.

20:54.166 --> 20:55.625
Generous bounties.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.083
What'd you do to earn them?

21:02.125 --> 21:06.375
We're gonna kill the empress.
And anyone else who took part in her coup.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.125
And anyone standing in our way.

21:14.583 --> 21:18.208
Well, you two must be madder than a bag of
cats if you think you can pull that off.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.458
Reckon you'll be killing
a lot of empire soldiers, then.

21:21.958 --> 21:23.041
That a problem?

21:23.125 --> 21:24.958
No, not by me, square jaw.

21:26.791 --> 21:29.583
Vicious pricks wiped out
a village that had taken me in.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.500
Good people.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.541
I thought that I was done with killing.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.958
Seems that killing isn't done with me.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.208
So… I reckon I'll be joining
your little story.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.458
If you'd have me.

21:55.666 --> 21:57.250
How good are you with those cleavers?

21:58.416 --> 21:59.375
Too good.

22:01.750 --> 22:02.916
The name's Callan.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.250
But most folks call me Brother Death.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.000
I have a brother.

22:10.541 --> 22:11.541
He's dead.

22:18.708 --> 22:19.708
Smell the wound.

22:20.416 --> 22:22.000
Ugh!

22:22.083 --> 22:24.166
The blade that caught her
must have been poisoned.

22:24.250 --> 22:26.625
It's corpse oil.

22:27.458 --> 22:28.625
She'll be dead by dawn.

22:31.458 --> 22:36.125
You'll be much faster to Xin'trea…
without me.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.333
-Leave me here.
-No.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.000
-Under the stars.
-Mm-mm.

22:41.958 --> 22:45.000
My tribe will take me.

22:47.375 --> 22:48.416
I can

22:49.750 --> 22:51.083
take you to a healer.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.333
A mage?

22:53.916 --> 22:54.958
Of sort.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.458
She's different.

22:58.458 --> 22:59.583
Powerful.

23:00.541 --> 23:02.250
I don't know that she'll help.

23:02.333 --> 23:05.750
And she'll just as likely kill you
if she don't like the look of you.

23:08.625 --> 23:10.916
But I can see that you care about her.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.375
The whole Continent is looking for us.
Éile, we don't know him.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.500
Take us to your healer.

23:22.166 --> 23:26.041
<i>And so three became four.</i>

23:28.333 --> 23:30.125
This is her
Marsh of the Mists.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.958
No matter what you see,

23:36.750 --> 23:38.500
try and make it to the other side.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.791
Get back in the fight, brother!

24:21.958 --> 24:23.291
Kareg!

24:24.583 --> 24:25.458
No!

24:33.833 --> 24:37.625
Brother, do you remember
the first boar you ever killed?

24:37.708 --> 24:38.833
I've forgotten.

24:47.750 --> 24:48.958
I've forgotten a lot of things.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.041
Mother?

25:27.583 --> 25:29.583
They wronged your king, Éile.

25:29.666 --> 25:31.458
-No! Please don't do it!
-I…

25:31.541 --> 25:34.583
-Earn your clan tattoos.
-No! No!

25:35.500 --> 25:37.416
Let us out! Please!

25:49.041 --> 25:51.708
No, please, no!

25:52.416 --> 25:53.291
No!

26:20.708 --> 26:22.416
-<i>To the Lark!</i>

26:22.500 --> 26:24.958
-<i>The Lark! The Lark!</i>

26:25.041 --> 26:25.875
<i>The Lark!</i>

26:28.833 --> 26:30.583
-I got you!

26:34.208 --> 26:36.583
-It's okay.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.291
Hello, Callan.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.000
Hello, my love.

27:11.208 --> 27:12.208
You had no right.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.708
It's not me you're angry at.

27:14.208 --> 27:15.541
Thanks for warnin' us.

27:17.916 --> 27:19.791
I'm here. It's okay.

27:20.333 --> 27:23.958
If you'd known, your memories would have
been tainted as you tried to protect them.

27:25.000 --> 27:25.875
He's right.

27:26.416 --> 27:27.791
What the fuck?

27:27.875 --> 27:29.000
Syndril.

27:30.291 --> 27:34.041
Zacaré's mists need a pure signal
to read you honestly.

27:34.916 --> 27:36.500
He's involved in all of this shit!

27:41.333 --> 27:43.375
If anyone gets to punish Syndril, it's me.

27:44.041 --> 27:47.958
And trust me, I will. But right now,
your friend's in dire need of healing.

27:49.458 --> 27:50.541
Follow me.

28:02.458 --> 28:06.125
It's all about the little things,
isn't it? When you think about it.

28:07.166 --> 28:10.416
The little traces
we leave behind of ourselves.

28:11.625 --> 28:12.833
Our little tells.

28:14.583 --> 28:18.041
I could always tell when Gwen had been
in a room or crossed a street.

28:18.958 --> 28:23.250
That smell of, uh… winterberry and lilac.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.541
Still don't know how she did that.

28:30.791 --> 28:33.666
Followed you all over
this cursed continent, so I have.

28:34.875 --> 28:35.875
Gaylth.

28:36.458 --> 28:37.541
Bon Machán.

28:38.041 --> 28:39.333
Kilmac.

28:39.416 --> 28:44.458
Just missing you
by a bee's dick sometimes.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.541
You'd think finding
a sergeant with one eye

28:49.625 --> 28:51.958
and a penchant for pretty dwarves
would be easy.

28:53.583 --> 28:55.833
I can hear Gwen laughin' at me.

28:55.916 --> 28:58.541
Cursing the gods each time I missed you.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.166
I loved her, you see.

29:06.125 --> 29:07.291
I really, really did.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.583
Come on, love.

29:15.833 --> 29:19.458
HERE LIES TALYYSEN OF THE ONE EYE,
RAPIST, MURDERER.

29:19.541 --> 29:23.500
ENDED BY GWEN OF THE FLOWERS.
MAY HE SUFFER ETERNITY IN THE LOST PLACE.

29:23.583 --> 29:25.708
I think we've had enough of Elven cities.

29:30.541 --> 29:33.416
<i>Meldof was done with the world of elves.</i>

29:34.125 --> 29:35.666
<i>But the world of elves</i>

29:36.166 --> 29:38.000
<i>was far from done with her.</i>

29:45.958 --> 29:48.041
Wh-- where are you taking us?

29:48.125 --> 29:51.791
On an adventure.
To meet a wonderful friend of mine.

30:03.041 --> 30:04.000
Come.

30:05.375 --> 30:07.791
She knows how special you are.

30:30.958 --> 30:33.291
I have brought you celestial siblings.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.666
Born under a scarlet moon.

30:36.666 --> 30:37.958
Their magic is rare.

30:38.833 --> 30:39.791
Powerful.

30:39.875 --> 30:42.208
-<i>I can taste it.</i>
-<i>Taste…</i>

30:42.291 --> 30:43.583
Are you sure?

30:43.666 --> 30:47.750
<i>The power you seek is not given freely.</i>

30:47.833 --> 30:51.000
<i>Chaos magic comes with a cost.</i>

30:51.083 --> 30:52.333
<i>A cost…</i>

30:56.041 --> 30:58.750
<i>The world lies at your feet, sage.</i>

30:58.833 --> 31:00.250
<i>Sage…</i>

31:20.500 --> 31:23.750
<i>A magic beyond belief</i>
<i>surged through him.</i>

31:24.333 --> 31:26.625
<i>White-hot. Unstoppable.</i>

31:27.541 --> 31:30.250
<i>It felt like pure chaos.</i>

31:36.875 --> 31:40.416
-No.
<i>-Mere tokens beget mere tastes.</i>

31:40.500 --> 31:43.875
<i>-Transformation requires true sacrifice.</i>
-<i>Sacrifice…</i>

31:43.958 --> 31:45.208
What do you mean?

31:47.916 --> 31:49.958
What do you mean, true sacrifice?

32:03.250 --> 32:05.500
-Quite the collection.

32:05.583 --> 32:06.791
Is that an Aibelle?

32:07.500 --> 32:10.125
You have
an excellent eye, Empress.

32:10.208 --> 32:12.291
And you have excellent taste.

32:31.875 --> 32:33.750
Good morning, High Commander.

32:33.833 --> 32:36.208
Please, join us.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.041
We were so careful.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.583
Sometimes, luck simply casts her lot
against you.

33:03.458 --> 33:05.666
I'm not here to expose you.

33:07.166 --> 33:09.708
I know what it's like to love someone
from a forbidden class.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.458
I'm here alone.

33:14.625 --> 33:15.708
With a proposition.

33:16.666 --> 33:17.708
That's bold.

33:19.666 --> 33:20.875
Or foolish.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.583
Well, surely I couldn't be
in safer company,

33:24.083 --> 33:26.625
with the high commander
of the Golden Empire army

33:26.708 --> 33:30.375
and a future member
of my Imperial Council.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.833
You-- you'd make me
a member of your council?

33:33.916 --> 33:35.833
With a title.

33:35.916 --> 33:39.708
How does Ambassador of Trade
to the New Worlds sound?

33:41.500 --> 33:44.416
Isn't that what you want?
A seat at the table.

33:45.041 --> 33:48.041
Access to the new worlds free of Balor.

33:48.125 --> 33:50.875
The social status to marry, if you wish.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.583
-I don't mean to presume.
-Balor would never allow it.

33:54.666 --> 33:58.666
Well, I propose we show Balor
that the Crown and military are as one.

33:59.375 --> 34:02.625
That he answers to our empire,
not the other way around.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.875
Why should I take the risk?

34:10.708 --> 34:12.666
You and I want the same thing.

34:14.583 --> 34:16.958
To expand our nascent empire.

34:18.791 --> 34:22.583
Balor is a lowborn
who despises our existence.

34:23.458 --> 34:26.500
He will never treat you as an equal.
Surely you must see that.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.291
He controls the gateways.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.166
We need him to get to those new worlds.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.875
Not for much longer.

34:34.958 --> 34:36.791
If we work together.

34:40.333 --> 34:43.125
There is… one more thing that I require.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.625
An heir.

34:47.875 --> 34:51.833
Please ensure that Fjall Stoneheart
is brought back to me, alive.

34:52.833 --> 34:56.958
He's more likely to cut your throat
than grace you with an heir.

34:57.666 --> 34:59.750
Well, circumstances change.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.125
Those at odds can become allies.

35:04.458 --> 35:05.416
So…

35:06.541 --> 35:07.875
do we see eye to eye?

35:15.041 --> 35:16.750
Well, don't think on it too long.

35:18.125 --> 35:22.375
Lives seem to be made and destroyed
in the blink of an eye these days.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.583
-This could be a new beginning.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.333
Or our quick end.

36:10.416 --> 36:13.125
You and the mage,
how do you know each other?

36:13.666 --> 36:14.791
Brother and sister.

36:15.291 --> 36:16.333
Of a sort.

36:17.583 --> 36:20.750
Born at the same time,
in the same village,

36:20.833 --> 36:22.791
under the same burning star.

36:24.708 --> 36:28.666
Celestial twins. Gifted with
the same magical talents, but, um…

36:30.458 --> 36:31.458
that was a long time ago.

36:31.541 --> 36:32.708
Hold her elbow.

37:04.375 --> 37:05.208
Thank you.

37:10.125 --> 37:12.625
-How do you feel?
-Amazing.

37:19.916 --> 37:21.416
What happened in Xin'trea?

37:25.041 --> 37:29.125
You know, I have spent my entire life

37:30.416 --> 37:32.750
dreaming of reaching another world.

37:34.958 --> 37:37.750
And when the gateway finally worked,
I was overjoyed.

37:38.333 --> 37:41.500
The land, the food, the endless resources.

37:41.583 --> 37:44.750
Hope for elvenkind
for generations to come.

37:44.833 --> 37:47.458
But the world we stepped into was dead.

37:48.958 --> 37:49.958
Utterly barren.

37:50.750 --> 37:51.666
"We"?

37:52.375 --> 37:55.625
Chief Sage Balor was at my side.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.625
There was an energy there
that terrified me.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.375
And in the sky,

38:03.791 --> 38:05.000
a great beast.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.333
The sound it made…

38:14.000 --> 38:18.083
I tried to warn Balor
about what I had felt in that place,

38:18.166 --> 38:20.875
that chaotic power.

38:21.666 --> 38:24.916
I told him.
I told him that the gateway was a mistake,

38:25.000 --> 38:26.291
but he wouldn't listen.

38:27.791 --> 38:29.958
He took my <i>Book of Monoliths</i>
and locked me away.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.083
Told everyone else
I was lost on another world.

38:35.166 --> 38:37.166
And then, from my prison cell,

38:40.500 --> 38:45.291
I saw the very same beast,
under Balor's spell,

38:45.375 --> 38:47.208
turn them to a bloodied mist.

38:47.708 --> 38:50.416
I escaped and vowed
to destroy the gateways.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.916
So Balor is behind all this?

38:52.916 --> 38:54.375
Oh, you don't know.

38:56.333 --> 39:00.125
Merwyn slit your sister's throat herself.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.375
I speak the truth.

39:13.708 --> 39:17.708
-How big is this beast?
-Length of a ship from heads to tail.

39:19.583 --> 39:21.250
But there is a bigger problem.

39:23.458 --> 39:28.458
The monoliths are causing
tears between the worlds.

39:28.541 --> 39:31.791
Strange energies are leaking into ours.

39:31.875 --> 39:34.166
This is why Zacaré
struggles even to heal.

39:34.750 --> 39:37.875
We have mere suns
before our world is ripped apart.

39:39.666 --> 39:41.833
The end of our world is upon us unless…

39:41.916 --> 39:46.041
We need to destroy the master monolith
in Xin'trea. Ard Gaeth.

39:46.125 --> 39:47.041
Let us join you.

39:47.625 --> 39:50.291
You want to kill the empress?
Avenge your families?

39:50.375 --> 39:53.166
You'll never make it to Xin'trea
before the world's torn apart.

39:53.250 --> 39:57.250
We are planning on using a monolith
to force a gateway

39:57.333 --> 39:59.666
and jump straight inside
the palace courtyard.

39:59.750 --> 40:01.041
It's how I got here.

40:01.125 --> 40:05.125
Through a monolith a half sun's west.
We could be in the palace tonight.

40:05.208 --> 40:06.541
-Balor will have it protected.
-No.

40:06.625 --> 40:09.916
Balor doesn't know travel between
the monoliths themselves is possible.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.416
We stand a better chance together
than apart.

40:13.291 --> 40:15.125
The gods brought us together.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.750
There's meaning in that.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.791
We've no choice.
We have no sellswords, so…

40:22.416 --> 40:24.375
Fuck's sake. Okay.

40:24.458 --> 40:25.750
We'll protect you.

40:25.833 --> 40:28.916
You destroy the monolith.
We'll take down Merwyn and her beast.

40:34.625 --> 40:38.791
<i>And so four became six.</i>

40:51.333 --> 40:54.000
You hear
they're shipping us down to Xin'trea?

40:54.083 --> 40:56.208
Thought they didn't
let elfyns in their army.

40:56.291 --> 40:58.583
Well, I hear
they eat like kings down there.

40:59.250 --> 41:03.625
Lowborn to highborn,
every one of them as plump as fools.

41:03.708 --> 41:05.541
That's far enough…

41:05.625 --> 41:08.583
There's meat and fish
on every table.

41:56.791 --> 41:58.708
Why are there two moons?

41:58.791 --> 42:01.166
Where have you taken us, sage?

42:01.250 --> 42:04.291
I don't know. It should have worked.

42:04.375 --> 42:06.583
I thought
the palace would be fancier.

42:06.666 --> 42:08.583
Get us back to our world.

42:15.083 --> 42:17.708
So beautiful…

42:25.583 --> 42:26.750
Fuck!

42:27.500 --> 42:29.125
What the fuck is that?

42:29.208 --> 42:30.083
Go! Go!

42:30.916 --> 42:33.500
-No, wait for me!
-Éile! Move!
