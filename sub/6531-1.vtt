00:18.230 --> 00:20.130
Hello.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.190
Is that Alice?

00:22.370 --> 00:24.430
No, I think you've got
the wrong number.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.470
Well, what's your name?

00:28.640 --> 00:30.630
This is Stacy.

00:30.810 --> 00:33.300
Wh--? Who is this?

00:34.040 --> 00:35.600
Hello.

00:35.780 --> 00:37.800
Hello.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.000
Hello.

01:05.670 --> 01:06.960
Who is this?

01:14.570 --> 01:16.510
-Hey, Mr. Wilson.
-Hey, Dennis.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.010
A.J. Charlie. Katherine.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.280
A.J.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.850
Charlie.

01:36.290 --> 01:39.320
Andrew Joseph.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.960
A.J.

01:49.130 --> 01:51.330
Charlie? Katherine.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.340
Hello.

02:04.510 --> 02:06.410
Hello.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.970
Please stop calling me.

03:48.490 --> 03:51.090
Wait. Let's see it.

03:51.260 --> 03:54.290
-I'm winning you.
-Come on, you guys.

04:03.300 --> 04:04.460
Hello, sir.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.300
We have a 44-year-old
white female....

04:06.470 --> 04:07.460
What's going on?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.730
We were patrolling a block away
when the call came.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.970
-Who made the call?
-I'm not sure, sir.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.610
-Well, where did you find them?
-Upstairs bedroom.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.370
-Hey, Harv.
-Hey, Hines. You're growing a beard.

04:17.550 --> 04:18.779
-Yes, I am.
-Makes you look--

04:18.950 --> 04:20.410
Old and fat. I know, I've heard.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.380
-Where am I going, Lewis?
-Just around here, sir.

04:23.550 --> 04:27.040
-What did the coroner say?
-He's still here, wading through it all.

04:27.220 --> 04:28.520
Wading through it all?

04:28.690 --> 04:31.660
-You need gloves, sir?
-Yeah. Give them to me.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.920
That's a bedroom
round to your left.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.190
-What was the murder weapon?
-That's just it.

04:40.370 --> 04:41.730
What?

04:41.900 --> 04:44.230
There wasn't one.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.750
Nice, nice. Come on, get that.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.000
Sorry, coach.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.870
You're not concentrating, Jill.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.410
You can make 24 seconds.
We both know you can.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.950
Just focus on something
in the distance, and then--

06:31.120 --> 06:34.950
Run for it like nothing else exists.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.280
Right.

06:37.460 --> 06:41.010
Okay. Good practice, ladies.
Hit the showers.

06:47.430 --> 06:49.730
-Hey, Jill.
-Hey, Boom Boom.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.170
I'm sorry, your service
has been temporarily interrupted.

07:05.340 --> 07:09.900
If this is an emergency,
please dial 91 1.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.780
Jill.

07:17.150 --> 07:19.380
Come on, Jill.
You just gonna ignore me forever?

07:19.550 --> 07:20.810
Sounds good to me.

07:20.990 --> 07:23.980
I tried to call you last night,
but your cell phone was tweaked.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.420
-We need to talk.
-Bobby, we've talked.

07:26.590 --> 07:29.690
Seventy-four minutes yesterday,
1 24 the day before...

07:29.860 --> 07:32.190
...and 256 the day before that.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.020
-Just hear me out.
-I saw you with her.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.790
Well, what else is there to discuss?

07:37.300 --> 07:39.630
She kissed me.
I keep telling you that.

07:40.270 --> 07:44.970
-I barely even remember it, anyway.
-Wait, so you let her kiss you.

07:45.470 --> 07:47.370
-Please--
-Later, Bobby.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.030
Am I gonna see you tonight?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.110
-Did you hang tough?
-I hung.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.880
I don't want you
giving in to those blue eyes.

08:05.050 --> 08:07.150
I'm not gonna give in.

08:10.730 --> 08:15.590
You know, that's just the worst lion
I've ever seen, I gotta tell you.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.130
It's.... I know.

08:19.130 --> 08:21.070
So, what time are you
picking us up tonight?

08:21.230 --> 08:22.790
I'm not picking anyone up.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.240
-What do you mean?
-I'm grounded.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.300
All because you went over
your minutes?

08:27.470 --> 08:30.370
-Yep. Thanks to that jerk.
-I thought they were gonna wait...

08:30.540 --> 08:32.909
-...till after the bonfire.
-So did l.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.340
Hey, guys.

08:43.080 --> 08:46.810
-Guys, this is so high school.
-Scarlet, we're in high school.

08:54.890 --> 08:56.620
Anyway, they're making me
pay it off.

08:56.790 --> 09:01.460
-Yeah, I have to babysit. Tonight.
-Tonight?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.760
Who needs some
stupid bonfire party, anyway?

09:07.940 --> 09:12.600
It's just a bunch of skanks and jerks
acting like idiots, right?

09:40.660 --> 09:43.930
So Mom was able to get the tickets.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.570
I was kind of hoping
they'd be sold-out.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.770
Just be glad you're not going.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.660
It's baroque chamber music.

09:56.910 --> 09:59.200
Since the concert isn't over
until after midnight...

09:59.380 --> 10:01.570
...Dr. Mandrakis will
drive you home, okay?

10:01.740 --> 10:03.540
I could have at least
driven myself, Dad.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.510
Jill, you went over by 800 minutes.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.740
Do you know how much that cost us?

10:09.280 --> 10:11.810
-At least you could wait until after 8:.00.
-I know.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.650
-I always do.
-Except this time you didn't.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.310
That's-- That's not fair, Dad.
You know why.

10:18.490 --> 10:20.180
Sweetheart, I know. But still....

10:20.360 --> 10:26.090
Wha--? So if I drove myself, you think
I'd have just bailed and not shown up?

10:26.960 --> 10:30.560
It's one month, Jill.
No phone, no car.

10:31.070 --> 10:35.160
Besides, I don't want you driving
home alone this far so late at night.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.710
Boy...

10:51.880 --> 10:55.340
-...they really live pretty far out here.
-Yep.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.320
-You gonna be okay out here alone?
-Depends what they have TiVo-ed.

11:06.390 --> 11:08.290
Guess I should have been a doctor.

11:27.810 --> 11:29.800
Just think of this
as learning responsibility.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.710
Dad, I am responsible.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.110
I mean, when it's not easy...

11:34.280 --> 11:38.980
...when it's complicated,
when it hurts. That's when it counts.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.740
Call us if you need anything.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.500
-You guys have fun.
-Say it like you mean it.

12:33.630 --> 12:35.360
Hi, I'm the babysitter.

12:35.530 --> 12:37.960
Oh, right, yes. Come in.

12:41.030 --> 12:43.660
I'm sorry to rush,
but I think we're a little late.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.860
Honey, have you seen the keys?

12:46.840 --> 12:49.770
Don't yell.
I just got the kids to sleep.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.770
-Did you check the kitchen?
-Yeah.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.040
Well, try the office.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.940
You must be Jill.
I'm Kelly Mandrakis.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.670
Nice to meet you both.

13:01.850 --> 13:04.780
We were so thrilled to find
a babysitter at the last minute.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.280
You come highly recommended
by the Thompsons.

13:07.450 --> 13:08.510
Well, they're great.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.880
If you can handle them,
we're gonna be a cakewalk.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.850
Yeah.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.720
-Tim, keys?
-Yeah.

13:15.090 --> 13:16.720
Come on, I'll show you around.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.290
The kitchen's back here.

13:27.470 --> 13:31.770
That's Chester.
He'll probably be there all night.

13:45.910 --> 13:47.400
It's beautiful.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.710
Bye, Chester.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.360
Oh, you'll get used to that.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.750
Here's a list of all the contact and
emergency numbers you might need.

14:00.930 --> 14:03.860
Our cell numbers. And that's
the number of the restaurant.

14:04.030 --> 14:07.020
Here's the phone. Don't hesitate
to call us about anything.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.320
Oh, and help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.990
I remember babysitting.
Food's the best part.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.740
Oh, and if you hear any banging
around upstairs, don't worry.

14:21.910 --> 14:25.310
That's our live-in Rosa.
She has a room on the third floor.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.950
She sometimes leaves
to go take care of her mother...

14:28.110 --> 14:29.840
...who's been pretty sick recently.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.380
-Your house is amazing.
-Thank you.

14:32.550 --> 14:34.750
Tim, have you seen my--?

14:34.920 --> 14:36.890
Okay.
Anything else, or are we done?

14:37.050 --> 14:40.220
-The guesthouse?
-Guesthouse.

14:41.420 --> 14:44.290
Our son, who's in college,
stays out there most weekends.

14:44.460 --> 14:47.490
Not that he ever calls
to let us know when he's coming.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.130
You have a son in college?

14:50.300 --> 14:51.730
From my first marriage.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.830
Our dinner reservations
are at 8...

14:54.000 --> 14:56.300
...but we might catch
a movie afterwards...

14:56.470 --> 14:59.030
...which would put us home
around midnight. Is that okay?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.260
-That's fine.
-Great.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.900
-Okay. Anything else? All set?
-The children?

15:05.940 --> 15:08.070
First bedroom
at the top of the landing.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.540
They're getting over the flu.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.270
We had a hard time
getting them to sleep...

15:11.450 --> 15:14.210
...so whatever you do,
please, try not to wake them.

15:15.550 --> 15:17.250
Oh, we have an alarm system.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.950
I'll write the code
down for you right here.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.880
-You familiar with these?
-Yes.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.520
Okay, honey, let's go.

15:28.490 --> 15:30.460
Bye.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.160
-Just make yourself at home.
-Okay.

19:11.830 --> 19:16.200
Oh, thank you. I just bought them.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.480
Hello?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.980
Dr. Mandrakis?

20:32.490 --> 20:34.550
Rosa?

20:39.670 --> 20:41.600
Rosa?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.170
Rosa?

21:01.180 --> 21:04.340
Rosa, this is Jill the babysitter.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.650
Hello.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.610
Hello.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.790
Mandrakis residence.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.600
Hello?

24:10.360 --> 24:12.590
Chester.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.960
What are the kids like?

24:25.140 --> 24:27.230
I don't know.
They were asleep when I got here.

24:27.410 --> 24:29.000
And the house?

24:29.170 --> 24:30.800
Pretty amazing.

24:30.980 --> 24:34.880
You should see her closet.
It's bigger than my room.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.270
Food?

24:36.450 --> 24:37.840
I haven't checked that out yet.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.850
Good closet means good supplies.

24:41.020 --> 24:43.950
Listen, I'm not sure if I should
tell you this, but--

24:44.120 --> 24:45.980
What?

24:46.150 --> 24:47.450
The jerk called me.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.150
He wants your number over there.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.650
Well, did you give it to him?

24:51.820 --> 24:53.620
No, because he'd call.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.020
It's okay to give it to him.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.820
I'm smelling weakness.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.400
I'm not being weak.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.860
Then why talk to him?

25:02.030 --> 25:04.430
So I can just end this thing
once and for all.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.230
Well, that sounds convincing.

25:07.870 --> 25:09.860
Come on, I got it.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.840
The person you really should
be talking to is Tiffany.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.110
When are you heading
over to the bonfire?

25:18.280 --> 25:21.540
Nice subject change.
I'm on my way now.

25:21.710 --> 25:24.370
I wanna get a good seat before
the jocks start streaking...

25:24.550 --> 25:26.520
...like a pack of wild idiots.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.780
Now you're really
making me sad I'm missing it.

25:29.950 --> 25:31.820
You want me to swing by first?

25:31.990 --> 25:33.280
No, it's okay.

25:33.790 --> 25:36.690
But give Bobby the number,
all right?

25:37.160 --> 25:41.600
-Don't say I didn't warn you.
-Fine, I've been warned.

26:15.790 --> 26:18.020
-Hello.
-This is TTR Protection.

26:18.190 --> 26:19.560
We just registered your alarm.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.890
Is there an emergency,
or do you need assistance?

26:22.060 --> 26:24.190
No, not at all.
I'm just the babysitter.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.560
I think the maid set off the alarm.

26:26.730 --> 26:28.250
May I have the password please?

26:28.430 --> 26:31.400
Password? I only have a number.

26:31.870 --> 26:34.770
I'll have to check with the Mandrakises
to confirm your identity.

26:34.940 --> 26:38.300
-What is your name?
-Jill Johnson.

26:48.950 --> 26:51.410
Okay, Miss Johnson,
Mrs. Mandrakis confirmed.

26:51.580 --> 26:54.210
-Good night.
-Thank you.

27:04.930 --> 27:06.860
Hello.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.820
Hello, is somebody there?

27:11.130 --> 27:14.070
Is everything okay? We just got
a call from the alarm company.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.460
Everything's fine.
The alarm just went off.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.130
I don't know how many times I've
written the number down for Rosa.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.200
-Did it wake the kids?
-I don't think so.

27:21.370 --> 27:23.600
They're still quiet.
Do you want me to go check?

27:23.770 --> 27:27.210
No, no. Trust me, you'd know
if they were awake.

27:27.380 --> 27:30.280
Okay. Well, good.
Call if you need anything else.

27:30.450 --> 27:32.850
Okay. Thank you.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.380
Rosa.

27:40.550 --> 27:43.180
Is everything okay?

28:22.390 --> 28:24.010
Rosa.

28:25.150 --> 28:26.380
Are you still here?

28:42.430 --> 28:44.530
Hello.

28:45.740 --> 28:47.230
Mandrakis residence.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.740
Is everything okay?

28:51.910 --> 28:54.270
Dr. Mandrakis?

29:59.060 --> 30:00.720
Hello.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.090
-Hello.
-Hey.

30:06.660 --> 30:10.190
-Who is this?
-What are you wearing?

30:10.370 --> 30:14.360
Combat boots and a parka,
you jerk. Who is this?

30:16.070 --> 30:18.230
Bobby, is this you?

30:20.240 --> 30:22.510
Whoever this is, this isn't funny.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.610
Yeah, it is.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.770
Assholes.

34:01.380 --> 34:02.940
Hello.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.710
Hello.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.980
-My God, the look on your face.
-What the hell are you doing here?

34:13.290 --> 34:16.880
Oh, my God. Could this house
be more awesome?

34:17.060 --> 34:19.889
Tiffany, you don't just do this
to people. Why didn't you call?

34:20.060 --> 34:21.530
I just did.

34:23.030 --> 34:25.120
-How did you get in?
-The garage door is open.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.330
What?

34:28.730 --> 34:30.100
What's the big deal?

34:42.110 --> 34:45.080
I've been getting really weird
prank phone calls all night.

34:45.239 --> 34:48.469
So then don't answer the phone.
I'm sure they have voice mail.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.980
-Well, maybe I'm expecting a call.
-From Bobby?

34:52.620 --> 34:54.550
-What's it to you?
-Oh, I don't know.

34:54.719 --> 34:57.050
Maybe because I'm your best friend.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.810
It's a little hard to remember
after what you did.

35:06.790 --> 35:10.990
How many times do I have to say
that I'm sorry? It was one kiss.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.890
And besides,
you know what tequila does to me.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.290
Then don't drink.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.270
-Fine, I'll try.
-Face it, Tiffany...

35:18.440 --> 35:20.960
...you've been crushing
on Bobby ever since ninth grade.

35:21.270 --> 35:22.470
Yeah, I have.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.540
It's because he asked me out first.
I was with him for one day...

35:25.710 --> 35:27.440
...when he spotted you.

35:27.610 --> 35:31.880
I never got my kiss, so I figured
I had it coming to me.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.650
Now we're even.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.750
You know what? That's the lamest
excuse I've ever heard.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.910
Jill, I'm a bitch.

35:41.250 --> 35:44.380
I know that, you know that,
everybody knows that.

35:45.990 --> 35:48.020
Let's go do a truce shot.

35:48.430 --> 35:51.920
-I bet they have a killer bar.
-You're quitting, remember?

35:52.100 --> 35:55.260
Sherry, port. So, what about
something real, people?

35:55.430 --> 35:58.800
Voila. Tequila.

35:58.970 --> 36:01.660
Didn't we just talk about
you not drinking, Tiffany?

36:03.140 --> 36:07.270
-You were serious?
-Okay. You gotta go...

36:07.440 --> 36:09.570
...because I'm babysitting.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.680
Okay, fine.

36:11.840 --> 36:15.570
But at least come with me to
the bonfire, just for a couple of hours.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.370
I mean, the kids are asleep, right?

36:17.550 --> 36:21.980
So you could just set the alarm
and no one would ever know.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.150
Kidding.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.620
-Bye.
-Bye.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.280
Call me.

37:05.550 --> 37:07.540
Shit. Oh, shit.

37:33.140 --> 37:34.800
Oh, God.

39:01.170 --> 39:03.570
Oh, no. Come on.

39:14.820 --> 39:19.650
Tiffany. Tiffany, come on.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.090
This isn't funny.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.260
Tiffany?

40:03.490 --> 40:05.150
Hello.

40:07.590 --> 40:09.520
Mandrakis residence.

40:09.690 --> 40:13.390
-Jill, is that you?
-Bobby. Bobby, are you there?

40:13.560 --> 40:16.220
Wait, move around.
We've got a bad connection.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.560
-Jill.
-Yeah, it's me.

40:18.730 --> 40:22.460
Listen, have you been calling me?

40:22.640 --> 40:24.430
Hold on.

40:25.570 --> 40:28.330
-Can you hear me? Is that better?
-Yeah, it's better. Listen--

40:28.510 --> 40:30.630
-No one can get a signal up here.
-Bobby, listen.

40:30.810 --> 40:33.140
-Have you been calling me here?
-What?

40:33.310 --> 40:35.970
I won't get mad. I just need to know
if you've been calling.

40:36.550 --> 40:39.880
Well, Cody pranked you,
but I made him stop.

40:40.050 --> 40:41.950
-Just once?
-Yeah, I think so.

40:42.120 --> 40:45.480
Bobby, listen, this is very important.
I won't get mad.

40:45.650 --> 40:47.550
Has he called me more than once?

40:47.720 --> 40:49.120
I don't know.

40:49.290 --> 40:51.380
Hold on, let me check.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.720
Hey, Cody.

40:56.230 --> 40:57.790
Bobby?

41:00.030 --> 41:02.020
Are you still there?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.840
The person you are trying
to reach is out of range.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.370
Please try your call again--

41:42.300 --> 41:45.160
Tiffany, I know it's you.

41:46.630 --> 41:50.430
I can see your name
on caller ID, genius.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.000
This isn't Tiffany.

41:57.740 --> 41:59.570
Who is this?

42:00.010 --> 42:01.910
Who is this?

42:04.710 --> 42:06.510
Cody?

42:06.920 --> 42:09.040
Who's Cody?

42:09.420 --> 42:11.750
You better cut this out.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.080
Hello.

42:58.250 --> 43:00.980
-Hello.
-Scarlet, it's me, Jill.

43:01.220 --> 43:03.380
-Jill.
-Can you hear me?

43:03.990 --> 43:06.760
Barely. No one can get
any service up here.

43:06.930 --> 43:08.260
Yeah, I know. Listen--

43:08.430 --> 43:11.230
-Did Tiffany come up to talk to you?
-Yeah, she came by.

43:12.130 --> 43:14.430
Did you kiss and make up?

43:14.670 --> 43:16.030
Jill?

43:16.200 --> 43:18.100
-Scarlet--
-Are you there?

43:23.110 --> 43:25.800
The person you are trying to reach
is out of range.

43:25.980 --> 43:28.470
Please try your call--

43:38.380 --> 43:39.910
Hello, you've reached Ben Johnson.

43:40.090 --> 43:43.320
Sorry I missed your call. Please leave
a message after the beep.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.620
Dad...

43:46.790 --> 43:50.560
...it's Jill here. Can you call me at the
Mandrakises' when you have a chance?

43:50.730 --> 43:51.960
Okay? Thanks.

44:05.540 --> 44:07.230
Please leave me
a detailed message...

44:07.410 --> 44:11.140
...and I'll return your call
as soon as I can. Have a great day.

44:11.310 --> 44:13.440
Hi, Mrs. Mandrakis.
It's me, Jill, calling.

44:13.610 --> 44:16.240
Could you give me a call
when you get a chance?

44:16.410 --> 44:20.910
But don't-- Don't worry,
everything's fine. Okay, thank you.

44:31.790 --> 44:33.450
Il Cielo, how may I help you?

44:33.630 --> 44:36.260
Hi. Can I speak
with Dr. Mandrakis, please?

44:36.430 --> 44:40.390
Dr. Mandrakis?
He left about 40 minutes ago.

44:40.570 --> 44:43.400
That's what I thought.
Okay, thank you.

44:50.940 --> 44:53.070
Operator.
How may I direct your call?

44:53.240 --> 44:54.940
Can I speak with the police?

44:55.110 --> 44:57.580
-Is this an emergency?
-Yes.

44:58.180 --> 45:00.270
No. No, not really.

45:00.450 --> 45:04.470
-Would you like me to connect you?
-Yes, please. Thank you.

45:07.150 --> 45:09.280
Elan Valley Police Department,
Officer Burroughs.

45:09.450 --> 45:12.720
-How can I help you?
-I've been getting weird phone calls...

45:12.890 --> 45:15.860
...about every 1 5 minutes from a man.
It's starting to scare me.

45:16.030 --> 45:19.000
-An anonymous caller, miss?
-Yes.

45:19.160 --> 45:21.100
-Has he threatened you?
-No.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.860
Has he been using
obscene language?

45:23.030 --> 45:24.930
No. Sometimes he doesn't
even say anything.

45:25.100 --> 45:28.540
-He just keeps on calling.
-There's not much we can do...

45:28.700 --> 45:30.690
...unless there's a real threat.

45:31.140 --> 45:34.470
-Is the phone listed in your name?
-No, I'm just the babysitter.

45:34.640 --> 45:37.010
-What's your name?
-Jill Johnson.

45:37.180 --> 45:39.700
Do you have friends that can
come over, keep you company?

45:40.280 --> 45:43.110
No, they're all at the bonfire.
My school's having...

45:43.280 --> 45:44.800
...this big thing by the--

45:44.980 --> 45:47.750
I know. We have
a couple units over there.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.110
Sounds pretty wild.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.790
-Rosa's car.
-What's that?

45:54.960 --> 45:59.120
The housekeeper. I thought she left,
but l-- I guess she hasn't.

45:59.290 --> 46:01.760
There you go. You feel better
with the two of you there?

46:01.930 --> 46:03.490
Actually, I feel pretty stupid.

46:03.660 --> 46:06.220
There's a lot of freaks out there.
You were right to call.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.230
If you need anything else,
just call back.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.660
I'm here all night.
Just ask for Officer Burroughs.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.830
-Officer Burroughs.
- Take care, miss.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.560
Thank you.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.150
Rosa?

46:33.020 --> 46:34.820
Rosa.

47:03.810 --> 47:05.570
Rosa?

47:07.010 --> 47:08.340
Are you down there?

47:08.510 --> 47:12.170
Hello, this is Rosa.
Please, leave a message.

47:46.880 --> 47:50.000
Hello, this is Rosa.
Please, leave a--

49:13.640 --> 49:18.040
-Hello.
-Have you checked the children?

51:15.200 --> 51:18.690
-Hello.
-How were the children?

51:51.900 --> 51:53.230
Elan Valley Police.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.520
-He can see me.
-I'm sorry.

51:55.700 --> 51:59.100
It's Jill, the girl who called before
about the man who can--

51:59.270 --> 52:01.900
-Tell me what's going on.
-He called me again.

52:02.070 --> 52:05.470
-What did he say?
-He's out there. He's outside. He's--

52:05.640 --> 52:07.570
He's watching me
through the windows.

52:07.740 --> 52:10.180
-Did you see him?
-No, but I know he can see me.

52:10.340 --> 52:12.870
-He knew when I went upstairs.
-Okay. Take a deep breath.

52:13.050 --> 52:14.980
-Where's the housekeeper?
-l-- I don't know.

52:15.150 --> 52:17.110
I-- l-- I saw her purse and the keys...

52:17.280 --> 52:19.910
-...but l-- I can't find her.
-Is the house locked up?

52:20.080 --> 52:22.480
-Yes.
-Alarm system?

52:22.650 --> 52:24.450
-It's on.
-Okay.

52:24.620 --> 52:27.350
You're safe inside that house.
If he wanted to break in...

52:27.520 --> 52:31.320
-...he wouldn't be calling you.
-But he must want something.

52:31.490 --> 52:32.760
Listen to me.

52:32.930 --> 52:35.950
Miss, he's just some asshole
trying to hassle you.

52:36.130 --> 52:38.830
-There's something we can do.
-What?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.230
I can alert the phone company,
so when he calls...

52:41.400 --> 52:43.030
... we can try and trace the call.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.640
I can also get my commander
to authorize a GPS trace...

52:45.800 --> 52:47.600
...if he's calling from a cell phone.

52:48.240 --> 52:51.070
Now, I got your number here.
Can you verify the address?

52:51.240 --> 52:53.440
I don't....

52:53.710 --> 52:56.940
I don't know.
My dad brought me here. I....

52:59.450 --> 53:04.610
It's-- Wait.
Here. 3378 Old Mill Road.

53:04.780 --> 53:07.120
I know where that is.
Now, if he calls again...

53:07.290 --> 53:09.410
...try to keep him on the line
for 60 seconds...

53:09.590 --> 53:11.320
-...so we can trace the call.
-I can't.

53:11.490 --> 53:14.020
He doesn't stay on the phone
for more than a few seconds.

53:14.190 --> 53:15.990
I'll see if I can get a car out to you.

53:16.160 --> 53:19.790
But if I do, it's gonna take at least
20 minutes from the time of dispatch.

53:20.060 --> 53:22.360
Think you'll be okay until then?

53:24.830 --> 53:27.170
-Yes.
-Good.

53:27.340 --> 53:30.330
Now, I'll be watching the phone line.
Call me if you need to.

53:30.510 --> 53:33.340
Okay. Thank you.

54:12.170 --> 54:13.690
Hello.

54:17.980 --> 54:19.410
It's you, isn't it?

54:19.980 --> 54:23.310
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Wait, don't hang up.

54:27.780 --> 54:31.310
If you keep on calling,
must mean you wanna talk, right?

54:42.260 --> 54:43.660
Is it me you're calling for?

54:45.760 --> 54:48.530
Are you calling
for the Mandrakises?

54:50.830 --> 54:52.490
Damn it.

55:01.570 --> 55:03.510
Guesthouse.

55:19.460 --> 55:22.720
Hey, it's Todd. I'm not here.
I'm up at school.

55:22.890 --> 55:26.760
And if you don't have the number,
then there's probably a reason.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.960
Hi, it's Jill, the babysitter.

55:31.130 --> 55:34.590
If you or Rosa are in there,
could you please pick up...

55:34.770 --> 55:37.130
...or come up to the house?

55:37.300 --> 55:41.500
Someone's been calling,
and I called the police.

55:43.010 --> 55:46.630
I was wondering if you could come up
and wait here with me until they come.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.660
Todd?

57:39.730 --> 57:41.290
Hello?

57:47.170 --> 57:48.930
Todd.

58:27.200 --> 58:30.570
Hey, it's Todd. I'm not here.
I'm up at school.

58:30.740 --> 58:34.500
And if you don't have the number,
then there's probably a reason.

58:46.680 --> 58:48.670
It's you, isn't it?

58:50.950 --> 58:52.780
How did you get this number?

58:53.390 --> 58:56.080
How do you know I'm in here?

58:57.350 --> 58:59.580
Did you see me out there?

59:01.290 --> 59:03.990
Why are you doing this to me?

59:10.500 --> 59:14.230
Sixty seconds. Got you.

59:33.420 --> 59:36.320
You called the wrong phone line.

59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.240
Rosa.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.630
Rosa?

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.870
It's Jill.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.980
Hello.

01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:54.050
I know it's you.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.930
I'm not gonna be here much longer.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.090
Dr. Mandrakis and his wife
are coming home soon.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.340
Why won't you answer me?

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.980
I know you're there.
I can-- I can hear you breathing.

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.260
Is that what you wanted?

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.540
To scare me?

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.310
Because if that's what you want,
you can stop now...

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.810
...because it really worked.

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:30.530
But you don't know who I am,
or where I live.

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.690
And Dr. Mandrakis is gonna
take me home...

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:34.890
...as soon as he gets here.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.600
But maybe even the police
will take me home.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.610
Please, I mean, there has to be
a reason why you keep on calling me.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:03.410
I mean...

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.960
...if you're not trying to scare me,
what do you want?

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.960
Your blood...

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:12.030
...all over me.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.240
Rosa?

01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:06.400
-Stop calling me, you sick--
-Jill? Listen to me.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.100
We traced the call.
It's coming from inside the house.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:12.970
Do you hear me?
It's coming from inside the house.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.670
You need to get out of there
right now. Jill?

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.090
Oh, my God.

01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.250
Come on. Okay.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:50.830
Come on. Okay.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:17.840
Kids, come on.

01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:17.250
I'm Jill, the babysitter.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.300
Here. Stay right here.
Stay-- Stay here.

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:06.660
Get out.
Go out that window right there.

01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:50.620
No.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.990
Please, no.

01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:00.910
Get away. Go on.

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.790
Come back!

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.320
Come back!

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.510
Kids.

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:37.140
It's Jill.

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.920
Where are you?

01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:44.390
Come on. Come on.

01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:46.660
Come on.

01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:48.450
Please.

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:51.760
Come on. Oh, God.

01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:53.790
Kids.

01:15:57.230 --> 01:15:58.900
Come on.

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.000
There. Are you guys okay?

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.740
Kids, come on. You okay?
Come on. Gotta go.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.910
Come on, gotta go, gotta go.

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.370
Come on.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:47.260
-Jill! Jill, it's okay. You're safe!
-Stop it! No!

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:05.210
How you doing?

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:11.540
-Where is he?
-We've got him.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.820
He's in that police car
right over there.

01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:15.450
In ankle cuffs, handcuffs.

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:19.420
Enough sedatives to kill a horse.
We're gonna take him to the hospital.

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:22.220
We'll have four cops
guarding him around the clock.

01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:26.660
That's not enough.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.930
Take care, Jill.

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:32.010
--reporting to you
from Elan Valley...

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.310
...where police have
just apprehended a suspect--

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.310
--wanted in the murders
of 1 5 people here.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.470
--a violent struggle
with his intended victim--

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:40.340
--he's linked to murders
where women...

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.350
... were stalked
and harassed for hours--

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.610
--an elaborate game
of cat-and-mouse.

01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:47.850
Police are looking for links between
victims. They were young women--

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:51.220
--most recent victim was in
Buford County, 1 25 miles west--

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:52.790
--Elan Valley.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.060
As of now, his identity
remains a mystery.

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.960
Oh, my God! No! No!

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.570
-He's in the house! He's in the house!
-Look-- Look, listen to me.

01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:23.440
No! No! He's in the house, Dad!
He's in the house!

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:26.130
He's in the house!
No, you don't understand!

01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:28.070
No! He's in the house!

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:30.340
He's in the house!
