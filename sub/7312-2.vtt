00:04.439 --> 00:06.832
TEACHER:
The first main character
in Milton's epic

00:06.876 --> 00:08.399
is... Satan!

00:08.443 --> 00:10.097
[person coughing]

00:10.140 --> 00:11.402
Can anybody tell me

00:11.446 --> 00:15.102
what his most
famous quote is?

00:15.145 --> 00:16.059
[whispers]:
Paul!

00:16.103 --> 00:17.321
Anybody at all?

00:17.365 --> 00:18.888
Ooh.
[boy clears his throat]

00:18.931 --> 00:20.846
Aha.

00:20.890 --> 00:24.807
[throats clearing]

00:24.850 --> 00:27.157
[air horn blows, laughter]

00:27.201 --> 00:28.245
"Better to reign

00:28.289 --> 00:30.508
in Hell than
to serve in Heaven."

00:30.552 --> 00:33.685
Although neither option
is available to you right now.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.470
All right, the next two

00:35.513 --> 00:37.515
I think you can
probably guess:

00:37.559 --> 00:39.778
Adam and Eve.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.738
Now, this is really
their story.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.653
How they lost their place

00:44.696 --> 00:46.785
in the Garden of Eden.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.135
[children groaning]
And...

00:48.178 --> 00:49.397
Oh, come on.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.963
It's not that boring.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.313
[sighing]

00:54.663 --> 00:58.232
Well... [gasping]

00:58.275 --> 00:59.537
[school bell rings]

00:59.581 --> 01:01.844
[gasping]

01:33.615 --> 01:38.141
Now, this is where the brain
trust of the entire unit sits.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.708
Come on in,
come on in.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.101
Please have
a seat.
Oh.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.494
You notice how I've, uh...
I've angled my desk here

01:43.538 --> 01:46.367
to get a good vantage point
of the entire team here.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.456
Very important as an NCIS agent
to stay aware.

01:48.499 --> 01:49.674
What's going on here?

01:49.718 --> 01:51.328
We being replaced
with younger models?

01:51.372 --> 01:53.113
I ama younger model.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.940
If that was intended to hurt me,
you've succeeded.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.291
And we are not being replaced.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.249
They are
from Waverly University.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.990
Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.731
Director Vance's
internship program.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.167
WOMAN:
Wow.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.777
That's not a good idea.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.302
Feeds McGee's need
to have groupies.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.781
I wouldn't get
too comfortable.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.261
In fact, if I were you,

02:11.305 --> 02:13.568
I'd head
to the nearest exit, pronto.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.136
This is our, uh,
senior field agent,

02:16.179 --> 02:18.747
very special agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.576
Vi-sat-di-nah.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.753
I don't get it.
Indian?

02:24.796 --> 02:26.320
It's an acronym
of your name.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.364
It's how
she remembers things.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.975
That is very unattractive.

02:30.019 --> 02:33.631
So, why shouldn't we
get too comfortable?

02:33.675 --> 02:37.809
Agent Gibbs is not, uh,
shall we say, fond of outsiders.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.202
He's not gonna like you,
and frankly,

02:39.246 --> 02:41.030
you're not gonna
like him, either.
Tony.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.945
Why not?

02:42.988 --> 02:44.729
See, I'm not going to answer
that question because,

02:44.773 --> 02:45.817
if I do, he is going
to walk up and stand

02:45.861 --> 02:46.992
right behind me
and make me regret it,

02:47.036 --> 02:49.081
'cause that's
the way he works.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.996
He slithers through
the grass like a snake.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.215
He's not friendly.
He's oily...

02:52.259 --> 02:54.174
[grunts]
GIBBS:
Done, DiNozzo?

02:54.217 --> 02:56.350
Yes, boss. I was just thanking
the interns for coming by.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.307
Good.
They're staying.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.743
For the whole week.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.441
They are?

03:00.484 --> 03:02.617
Yeah. Knox--
you're Autopsy.
Yes!

03:02.660 --> 03:04.488
Seelus, Forensics.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.577
Zuse...

03:06.621 --> 03:07.709
Boss, I will be happy
to take them.

03:07.752 --> 03:08.710
So transparent.
Good, fine.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.407
Tell 'em where to go.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.670
Then gear up.
We got some kind

03:12.714 --> 03:14.585
of gas leak at Quantico.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.196
Spoke to the principal.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.936
He said the strongest thing
they have on school property

03:17.980 --> 03:19.024
is bleach,
which rules out an accident.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.243
Security cameras?

03:20.287 --> 03:21.418
Went off-line
before the attack.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.898
Oh, that's convenient.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.334
Pulling footage
from the last month.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.466
Uh, might be
something there.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.119
Yeah, well, find McGee.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.209
Check out the ventilation
system.
Will do.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.819
PRINCIPAL [over P.A.]:
Your attention, please.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.560
This is Principal Reynolds...

03:32.603 --> 03:33.778
There's no body, Duck.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.084
Yes, I'm aware of that.

03:35.127 --> 03:37.391
Only, my new intern was, uh,

03:37.434 --> 03:38.522
quite persuasive
in her request

03:38.566 --> 03:40.089
to see some
field work.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.613
This is very exciting.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.398
It actually kind of reminds me

03:44.441 --> 03:47.009
of the time my grandmother
took me to the Netherlands.

03:48.576 --> 03:49.881
Uh, the Netherlands?

03:49.925 --> 03:51.274
Oh, yes, we
were staying

03:51.318 --> 03:52.493
in a small hotel
in Rotterdam.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.755
Anyway, there was
this awful smell wafting

03:53.798 --> 03:54.973
from the air ducts.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.453
DUCKY: A dead rat.KNOX: Bingo!

03:56.497 --> 03:57.715
[both laughing]

03:59.456 --> 04:02.329
Well, this has got
to be the source of the gas.

04:02.372 --> 04:05.245
Jacked right
into the ventilation ducts.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.509
See, now Conrad, after
we take the photos,

04:08.552 --> 04:09.858
we'll, uh, gather
as much evidence

04:09.901 --> 04:11.425
from the school
as we can.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.949
Thought I was at least gonna
get out of school this week,

04:13.992 --> 04:15.298
not go straight back to one.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.692
McGee, I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

04:17.735 --> 04:20.869
and say this is the timer.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.263
Now, the very most important
thing is that

04:23.306 --> 04:24.742
we take detailed
notes on places

04:24.786 --> 04:26.483
where all the
evidence is found.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.224
When do we go home?

04:28.268 --> 04:31.445
Is there something wrong?

04:31.488 --> 04:33.664
TONY:
Intern Conrad,

04:33.708 --> 04:35.753
you do understand
that it's a crime

04:35.797 --> 04:37.320
to lie
to a federal officer.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.628
Look, all right,
I'm a finance major.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.674
This really
isn't my speed.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.633
So what are you doing here?

04:45.676 --> 04:48.679
Well, I spent the summer
on my father's yacht.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.291
Yacht?
And forgot to
register for classes.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.467
This was the
only class that

04:53.510 --> 04:56.513
fulfilled my public
affairs requirement.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.907
And an internship
at NCIS was the only class?

05:01.126 --> 05:02.954
The only class
that didn't meet on Fridays.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.132
[chuckles]

05:07.176 --> 05:08.830
What is this? What wasthis?

05:08.873 --> 05:10.266
Is somebody...?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.442
A practical joke or something?

05:12.486 --> 05:13.922
Possibly.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.185
It is also possible
it was an act of terrorism,

05:16.228 --> 05:19.057
or a diversion to acquire
something of value here.

05:19.101 --> 05:20.929
Hmm.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.322
This building
always a school?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.889
Oh, uh, no,
it used to be the armory.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.762
Everything of value
is long gone.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.764
No missing property.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.287
Everyone is accounted for.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.202
Nine teachers, 105 students.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.856
Yeah. Oh, no.
Wait a minute. That's wrong.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.947
No. There are 106 students
in this building.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.389
ZIVA:
106?

05:53.265 --> 05:55.529
Hey, boss, I.D.'s
been confirmed.

05:55.572 --> 05:59.794
Missing girl's name
is Rebecca Mason. 13.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.535
Lives in base housing
with her parents.They've been told?

06:01.578 --> 06:03.711
Not yet. They're both deployed
on ships in the Gulf,

06:03.754 --> 06:05.147
but, uh, we were
trying to reach 'em.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.148
Who's she staying with?

06:06.191 --> 06:07.671
Grandfather.
Bring him in?

06:07.715 --> 06:09.064
Already on his way in.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.195
Got McGee searching the base,

06:10.239 --> 06:12.110
and I sent Ziva over
to Rebecca's house

06:12.154 --> 06:14.548
to coordinate with the FBI.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.900
Did I miss something?No.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.118
Overstep my authority?

06:20.162 --> 06:22.033
No.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.513
Then what's wrong?

06:23.557 --> 06:24.732
[computer chirps]

06:24.775 --> 06:26.386
That's not enough.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.701
Where's my granddaughter?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.224
I don't know.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.662
But we're gonna find her.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.620
Your agent told me
what happened at the school.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.407
Maybe Becca got scared

06:47.450 --> 06:50.322
and ran off and hid
someplace on the base.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.976
We're assuming
kidnapping.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.022
I don't understand.

06:54.065 --> 06:57.025
We're smack in the middle
of a Marine base.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.330
They got all the security.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.332
Well...

07:00.376 --> 07:02.639
makes it hard,
not impossible.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.076
[sighs]

07:05.120 --> 07:06.817
They sure went
to a lot of trouble.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.864
[sighs]

07:09.907 --> 07:13.215
Can you tell me why?

07:13.258 --> 07:15.826
Her mother
just came into some money.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.785
Mm. How much?

07:17.828 --> 07:22.354
We don't talk about that sort
of thing in our family.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.792
But her dad just did buy

07:24.835 --> 07:26.663
a brand-new
pickup truck.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.839
I was driving it when
your people contacted me.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.624
Me and Becca--

07:30.667 --> 07:33.191
we were gonna go fly fishing
this weekend.

07:34.715 --> 07:38.719
How many 13-year-old girls
do you know

07:38.762 --> 07:41.286
that would give up a weekend

07:41.330 --> 07:43.463
to go fly fishing
with their grandpa?

07:44.594 --> 07:46.466
She sounds like a special girl.

07:48.729 --> 07:51.209
My world, Agent Gibbs. My world.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.516
Well, that's not gonna change.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.475
Mm. I appreciate
your confidence.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.000
[sighs]

07:59.043 --> 08:02.264
But if you'd forgive
an old man's skepticism...

08:02.307 --> 08:05.572
See, I was an insurance actuary

08:05.615 --> 08:06.921
before I retired.

08:06.964 --> 08:10.315
You Feds all have
the same track record

08:10.359 --> 08:12.535
when it comes
to child abductions,

08:12.579 --> 08:13.841
and it ain't good.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.495
[phone ringing]

08:20.151 --> 08:22.545
That's a sat number.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.112
Could be her dad.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.592
What am I gonna say?

08:28.464 --> 08:31.293
You say that we're doing
everything we can.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.866
Is that you, Nick?

08:38.909 --> 08:41.999
No, I'm over at, uh, NCIS.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.700
They're trying
to do everything they c--

08:49.790 --> 08:52.923
I'll, uh...
meet you downstairs.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.101
Yeah, I'm still here.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.495
Also, you are not to
touch my computer,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.671
my lab equipment,
my MP3 player,

09:01.715 --> 09:03.891
my caf-POW!, my desk

09:03.934 --> 09:06.589
or Burt, my farting hippo,
without my express

09:06.633 --> 09:08.809
written consent.Well, how am I gonna
do anything?

09:08.852 --> 09:11.202
And there's no cameras
or flash photography.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.421
I don't have a camera.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.597
And if I accidentally
turn my back to you,

09:14.641 --> 09:16.773
you're to immediately
move back into my eye line.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.470
Why don't I just
wear bells?

09:18.514 --> 09:20.516
That's a really
good idea.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.039
I mean, I'm sorry
about this.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.388
I mean, Darren
worked out,

09:23.432 --> 09:25.216
but I just
had problems

09:25.260 --> 09:27.784
with people that have
been assigned to my lab.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.699
[bells jingling]

09:31.179 --> 09:32.876
It'll just be
better this way.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.617
I, uh...

09:34.661 --> 09:36.314
I'm not putting those on.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.142
Oh, no. Actually, you are.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.536
No. I'm not.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.103
Except for the fact
that you are.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.321
[elevator bell dings]

09:43.365 --> 09:44.758
Abbs, I need
something fast.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.673
To be continued.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.327
Who are you, and
what have you done

09:49.371 --> 09:51.155
with my "Gibbs that
doesn't like interns"?

09:52.853 --> 09:54.463
Uh-huh.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.247
The missing girl
still missing?
Yeah.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.815
Okay, so, whoever
placed the cylinder

09:58.859 --> 10:01.557
that knocked everyone out at
the school was wearing gloves,

10:01.601 --> 10:03.385
so I wasn't able to
lift any fingerprints.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.995
However, I was able

10:05.039 --> 10:08.390
to electrostatically lift
a boot print from it.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.827
Can you trace it?

10:10.871 --> 10:12.437
Well, it's a work boot,

10:12.481 --> 10:14.222
and I'm still working on it,

10:14.265 --> 10:16.050
but it's what's inside
that gas cylinder

10:16.093 --> 10:17.486
that's really gonna
oil your rifle.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.488
[computer chirps]There are

10:19.531 --> 10:21.925
very few chemical compounds

10:21.969 --> 10:23.666
that would have the ability

10:23.710 --> 10:25.668
for such widespread
anes... anes...

10:28.671 --> 10:32.196
The ability to knock out
that many people.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.634
And this is not
one of them.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.636
I've never even heard
of this compound before.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.681
Means no one else
has, either.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.597
I've searched every
chemical registry known to man.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.817
This is some sort of novel
formula, which means...

10:43.860 --> 10:45.775
We're looking
for a chemist.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.299
Expand the Amber Alert
to the Tri-State area.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.867
We don't know what kind of
lead time they've got. Thanks.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.696
[sighing]
Done. No matches.

10:53.740 --> 10:57.047
Good. Now you can check these
names for any criminal records.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.396
CONRAD:
You already did.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.398
On the computer--
I-I saw you.

11:00.442 --> 11:03.184
McGEE: Well, if you want to
learn the fundamentals, Conrad,

11:03.227 --> 11:04.838
you need to do it
by yourself,

11:04.881 --> 11:06.361
by hand, several times.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.582
[whispers]:
Now you understand.

11:10.626 --> 11:14.282
It feels good,
doesn't it?

11:14.325 --> 11:16.284
Still no word
on the girl's BOLO.What about her house?

11:16.327 --> 11:18.373
Uh, the FBI did not
find anything useful.

11:18.416 --> 11:21.158
But they are set up just
in case there's a ransom call.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.986
What did Abby find?

11:23.030 --> 11:25.162
We're looking for someone
with a chemistry background.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.816
Well, I can run
Quantico's visitor records

11:26.860 --> 11:28.209
against work experience.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.472
I will cross-reference
with educational training.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.604
I'll keep trying to contact
the girl's parents.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.215
Trying?

11:34.258 --> 11:37.131
The ship is still
on radio silence.

11:42.353 --> 11:43.877
What about the grandfather?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.835
ZIVA: Mr. Mason left
when you went

11:45.879 --> 11:47.663
to see Abby-- he said
he was going home.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.838
Get him back in here.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.493
What's up, boss?

11:51.536 --> 11:54.017
He told me the parents called.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.454
No way. Even if they did,
from what I understand,

11:56.498 --> 11:58.282
the call has to get
routed through MTAC.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.284
Um, this is odd.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.417
There is no answer
at Mr. Mason's house.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.853
The FBI, at least,
should be answering.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.681
McGee.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.031
Running a diagnostic
on the phone line.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.729
All right, it got it.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.080
The line's been forwarded
to another number.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.342
Whose number?

12:14.385 --> 12:15.430
It's a Skype number.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.779
It's got no I.D.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.607
Received a call
20 minutes ago.

12:18.650 --> 12:19.782
But it's an
Internet phone call.

12:19.826 --> 12:20.957
I'll bet the audio files are

12:21.001 --> 12:22.089
still in the local
server's cache.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.264
What does that mean?

12:23.307 --> 12:24.395
Can I hear it?You can hear it.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.702
Let's hear it.[tapping keys]

12:26.746 --> 12:29.183
[distorted]:
If you want to see Rebecca
alive,

12:29.226 --> 12:31.098
you do exactly as we say.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.882
MAN:
Is that you, Nick?Is that the grandfather?

12:32.926 --> 12:34.536
[electronic trilling]

12:34.579 --> 12:37.191
GRANDFATHER:
Okay, I'm alone now.
Is Rebecca okay?

VOICE [distorted]:
Half a million in cash,
one hour,

12:42.587 --> 12:44.589
Come alone or she dies.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.554
Meet's in the alley.

12:52.597 --> 12:53.903
How we going in?

12:53.947 --> 12:55.818
Quiet.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.820
You heard him.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.517
DiNozzo, Ziva,
take the flank.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.954
McGee, you're with me.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.479
Rendezvous was
ten minutes ago.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.786
I know.Why didn't Mason

13:06.829 --> 13:08.091
tell us the
kidnappers called?

13:08.135 --> 13:10.398
Well, I don't think
he liked our track record.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.139
He's in way over his head.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.663
Got a lot of guts
coming out here alone.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.231
Actually, he's got a lot
of guts being over 60

13:17.274 --> 13:18.754
and owning a Skype phone.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.147
Now that I
think about it,

13:20.190 --> 13:22.845
not many guys his... age...

13:29.765 --> 13:31.549
That's not Mason.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.123
Dead guy's name is Eddie Lang--
no chemistry background,

13:40.167 --> 13:42.778
but he does have a rep
as a gun for hire.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.214
Video surveillance
from Quantico shows

13:44.258 --> 13:46.826
he entered the base
using falsified credentials.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.305
And Abby matched a print

13:48.349 --> 13:50.873
she got off the gas
cylinder to his boot.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.222
We've got our kidnapper.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.702
You got one of 'em.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.270
We found his vehicle--
maybe there is something in it

13:56.313 --> 13:58.663
that will lead us
to the others.What about Mason?

13:58.707 --> 13:59.926
No word on the BOLO yet,

13:59.969 --> 14:01.231
and I don't think
there's gonna be.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.885
I've been digging into
Mason's background--

14:02.929 --> 14:04.931
turns out it's all fake.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.280
The actuary
company where

14:06.323 --> 14:08.195
he said he worked is
an empty shell company.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.413
His tax returns

14:09.457 --> 14:11.241
reference
bank accounts

14:11.285 --> 14:13.200
that don't even exist--
it goes on and on.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.202
Nothing about this
guy is real, boss.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.595
Some kind of
retired spook?If he is,

14:17.639 --> 14:19.467
he's not one of ours--
no one's ever heard of him.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.990
So whose is he?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.078
Yeah. Gibbs.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.384
Sir, we have a call
from this Mason.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.559
I'll be right up.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.386
Mason just
called an MTAC.

14:25.429 --> 14:26.778
You can ask him yourself.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.215
GIBBS:
McGee, let's go.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.045
You guys are good,
I'll give you that.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.047
But you guys
could be making

14:34.090 --> 14:35.875
a killing in the
private sector.

14:35.918 --> 14:39.226
Then who'd catch
all the bad guys, Conrad?

14:43.752 --> 14:45.275
[quiet chuckle]

14:45.319 --> 14:47.451
He's routing
the call through

14:47.495 --> 14:49.410
a military
satellite somehow.Can you trace it?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.586
No, and I'm sure
that's the point,

14:51.629 --> 14:54.284
but he shouldn't even
have access to that
kind of equipment.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.807
TECH: We're connected.
Line is open.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.940
This is Special Agent Gibbs.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.073
It was self-defense.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.423
Why don't you come on in?
We can talk about it.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.729
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.472
You lied to me, Mason.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.388
I am sorry about that.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.738
But I just didn't
want to take the chance

15:13.782 --> 15:16.002
that NCIS would screw things up,

15:16.045 --> 15:18.439
so I went to
the ransom drop myself.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.267
Yeah? How'd that work out?

15:20.310 --> 15:23.226
You're not the only one
who was lied to.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.360
They said Rebecca
would be there.

15:26.403 --> 15:27.927
They lied.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.842
I did not start the fight.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.497
No, no, you just ended it.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.457
He was trying to kill me--
he gave me no choice.

15:36.500 --> 15:41.941
That's why I am calling you--
to warn you.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.334
These people cannot be trusted.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.903
It was like the amateur hour
out there today.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.861
And you're
the professional, right?

15:49.905 --> 15:51.820
I am what I am--

15:51.863 --> 15:53.953
bad luck for these guys.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
The rest is not important.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.348
Mason, you need to come in

15:58.392 --> 16:01.438
before you cross a line
that you can't come back from.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.920
I don't have a lot of time, so
let me be as clear as I can be.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.053
There is not
a force on this planet

16:07.096 --> 16:10.186
that's gonna stop me
from finding my granddaughter.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.928
You have to work within the law.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.887
I am a bit more flexible.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.024

17:24.043 --> 17:25.740
Well, the final
cause of death

17:25.783 --> 17:27.176
was spinal shock

17:27.220 --> 17:30.527
as a result of
blunt-force trauma

17:30.571 --> 17:32.399

all he did.

There's extensive
injuries everywhere.

17:37.926 --> 17:40.450
Mason gave him a beating
before he killed him?

17:40.494 --> 17:42.191
Well, not exactly.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.498
Note the broken knuckles.

17:44.541 --> 17:48.067
Rust in the wound
indicates that the blow

17:48.110 --> 17:49.329
landed on the Dumpster.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.722
Mason must have simply
dodged the punch.

17:51.766 --> 17:54.682
Torn ligaments
in his elbow here

17:54.725 --> 17:57.728
indicate that, well,
Mason caught another attack

17:57.772 --> 18:00.209
in some kind of joint lock.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.994
And then bruising
on the leg...

18:03.038 --> 18:04.692
Is that
a leg sweep?

18:04.735 --> 18:05.910
DUCKY:
Yeah.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.869
These are all
self-defensive injuries.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.479
DUCKY: Mason appears
to have put up

18:09.523 --> 18:11.307
a vigorous defense

18:11.351 --> 18:14.876
against a very...
determined aggressor.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.183
Certainly with the skill
Mason exhibited,

18:17.226 --> 18:19.228
if his intent
were to harm,

18:19.272 --> 18:21.970
well, he could have ended
the fight a great deal sooner.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.146
Not bad for a guy his age.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.148
Not for a guy of any age.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.716
Clearly, he was
extensively trained.

18:28.759 --> 18:29.934
Trained by who?

18:29.978 --> 18:31.197
That's by "whom."

18:31.240 --> 18:33.112
Yeah. That's
not pertinent.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.549
Look, what concerns me--

18:35.592 --> 18:38.117
look at the damage
he wrought playing defense.

18:38.160 --> 18:42.643

he's capable of on offense.

Yeah, but you've seen her?

You... Oh, you're clairvoyant!

18:51.521 --> 18:54.002
WOMAN:
Yes, I am.And you can see the future.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.699
Of course I can.Well, clearly,

18:55.743 --> 18:57.223
you can't see your own.

18:57.266 --> 19:01.183
Next time, you get the
crazy person tip hotline.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.403
You got anything good,
Mini Gee?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.100
Actually, I had plans
to go see--

19:05.144 --> 19:05.927
Bummer!

19:07.972 --> 19:11.062
Why do you think Gibbs suddenly
wants to have interns around?

19:11.106 --> 19:12.629
I do not know.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.545
[chuckles]
There's got to be a reason.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.286
Gibbs never does anything
without a reason.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.200
Stop listening!

19:20.028 --> 19:22.204
Must be exhausting.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.163
Reasons for everything.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.556
Anything good
on our dead kidnapper?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.689
I'm making as little
progress as you.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.778
Our dead kidnapper
is a dead end.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.258
McGEE:
Not completely.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.564
I finished processing his car,
and I found something.

19:34.608 --> 19:35.522
Where's boss?

19:36.914 --> 19:38.133
It's like he can smell it.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.875
Boss! I found something!

19:40.918 --> 19:43.312
I can hear you, McGee;
I got ears.

19:43.356 --> 19:46.097
GIBBS:
What do you got?

19:46.141 --> 19:48.187
Come on, McGee.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.753
Could you go
any slower?
Give it a rest.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.625
Coming up, boss.

19:55.498 --> 19:57.370
[sniffling]

19:57.413 --> 19:59.546
[sobbing]:
Please... please let me go.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.724
Please... I want to go home.

20:03.767 --> 20:04.986
[sobbing]

20:05.029 --> 20:06.553
Please...

20:06.596 --> 20:08.468
[sobbing continues]

20:13.603 --> 20:15.257
[sniffles]

20:15.301 --> 20:16.824
That's proof of life.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.131
That was... really real.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.656
Real as it gets.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.571
[beeping]

20:25.920 --> 20:28.879
Whoa. Uh... something
is happening here, boss.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.577
McGee...

20:30.620 --> 20:32.274
There's a Trojan horse
on the DVD.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.624
It's sending out some kind of
data packet over the Internet.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.060
It's our phone number.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.975
[phone ringing]

20:38.019 --> 20:39.238
Put it on the speaker.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.853
Special Agent Gibbs.
Who's this?

20:45.896 --> 20:48.203
MAN [distorted]:
An angry man.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.639
So, why are you angry, man?

20:49.683 --> 20:51.337
One of my men is dead.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.773
GIBBS:
Your first call to us

20:52.816 --> 20:54.470
was intercepted
by a family member.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.124
We know. The old man.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.952
We'll deal with him later.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.215
You don't need to do that--
NCIS is in charge now.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.303
We can handle it.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.087
The price is now $1 million.

21:04.915 --> 21:07.135
We're gonna need some time
to get that together.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.398
We still need to talk
to the parents.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.661
You have 24 hours.
[line clicks]

21:11.705 --> 21:15.056
Well, the call wasn't
long enough to trace,

21:15.099 --> 21:17.841
but there is something
going on here.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.540
There's another snooper agent
pinging the cell tower.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.281
At least pretend
you have a sex life.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.326
We're not the only ones
trying to trace the call.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.936
Mason.He must be running

21:25.980 --> 21:27.111
some kind of a sniffer program.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.461
Can you find the source?

21:28.504 --> 21:30.158
No, we already have the address.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.855
But, boss, if we can find Mason,

21:31.899 --> 21:33.814
that means
the kidnappers can, too.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.729
NCIS!

21:35.772 --> 21:39.167
Mr. Mason, if you're in there,
please open up.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.690
[dog barking in distance]

21:43.519 --> 21:44.477
Lock is broken.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.968
Kidnappers appear
to have gotten here first.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.143
Looks like Mason

21:59.187 --> 22:01.537
was waiting for them.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.499
This was not
self-defense.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.552
Still trying to identify
the body we found

22:16.596 --> 22:19.033
at the trailer park, boss,
and no trace of Mason anywhere.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.949
JIMMY: Hi. Uh, Dr. Mallard
wanted me to inform you

22:21.992 --> 22:24.386
that our current
John Doe shares a lot

22:24.430 --> 22:26.214
of the same injuries
as Mason's previous victim.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.520
Yeah. Noticed.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.522
And I took the liberty
of stopping by Abby's lab.

22:29.565 --> 22:32.176
She said she found Mason's
prints all over the trailer.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.701
We know.
Is there anything
else I can do for you two?

22:34.744 --> 22:36.529
No.Don't you have
some place to be?

22:36.572 --> 22:38.052
Look... Autopsy's getting
a little crowded.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.880
I can read the writing
on the wall.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.490
Uh...
And...

22:41.534 --> 22:44.275
See, I've always been fascinated
by what goes on inside of...

22:44.319 --> 22:47.714
MTAC... I will just be
right out here then!

22:47.757 --> 22:49.106
If you tell me

22:49.150 --> 22:51.152
you're doing everything
you can one more time...

22:51.195 --> 22:52.414
Lisa, calm down.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.068
LISA:
They have our daughter, Nick!

22:54.111 --> 22:56.331
We're going to get
your daughter back, ma'am.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.550
How?

22:57.593 --> 22:59.073
We go along with the ransom.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.640
We buy ourselves some time.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.772
We find her location.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.818
We don't have
a million dollars.

23:04.861 --> 23:06.863
Lisa inherited
only half that.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.212
[quietly]: It's gonna take
another two days

23:08.256 --> 23:09.475
to get that kind of money.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.215
We don't have two days.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.043
Why would the kidnappers
double the ransom?

23:13.087 --> 23:14.871
What has my father done now?

23:14.915 --> 23:16.569
Well, if you're asking
that kind of question,

23:16.612 --> 23:17.874
you can probably guess.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.311
We need to find him.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.487
He's not helping.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.358
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.707
Growing up, he told us

23:24.751 --> 23:26.013
the same stories
he probably told you.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.231
Insurance actuary.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.233
We knew it wasn't true.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.453
But you also
knew not to ask.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.934
If my mother knew,
she took it to her grave.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.631
Tell them about the safe.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.067
NICK:
The lockbox.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.809
Um... it's in the floor
of my dad's bedroom.

23:39.853 --> 23:42.203
I've seen him go through it
sometimes.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.813
I have no idea what's inside.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.902
Hopefully, something useful.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.643
You've got to get our
little girl back, Agent Gibbs.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.341
Not gonna stop until we do.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.300
If anything happens to her,

23:52.343 --> 23:54.998
my father-in-law will be
the least of your concerns.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.439
Hey, Andy.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.267
Agent Gibbs,
let me let you in.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.225
Thanks.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.444
No problem.

24:06.706 --> 24:07.837
Uh, good night.

24:32.296 --> 24:33.950
Sorry.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.518
I was, uh, just doing some
menial labor for Agent McGee.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.867
I didn't mean to pry.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.136
That's for the ransom.
Right?

24:48.225 --> 24:51.490
How about we just pretend
like I was never born?

24:51.533 --> 24:53.579
Kind of like we're pretending
I'm actually learning something.

24:58.671 --> 25:01.761
Yeah. It's for the ransom.

25:01.804 --> 25:05.199
And you... And you
can just do that?

25:05.242 --> 25:07.506
You can just take
the money like that?

25:07.549 --> 25:09.159
Can in two days.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.209
You could get in
a lot of trouble.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.698
So, why do it?

25:25.741 --> 25:27.351
It's my job.

25:29.049 --> 25:32.095
Your job is to
stick your neck out?

25:34.794 --> 25:36.752
Building catches fire...

25:36.796 --> 25:38.928
most people run away.

25:40.103 --> 25:43.759
Some people-- you run in.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.501
It's not safe to run
into a burning building.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.417
No. It's not.

26:01.516 --> 26:04.127
I heard you never allowed
interns on your team before.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.129
What's changed?

26:06.173 --> 26:07.522
[scanner trills, then beeps]

26:07.566 --> 26:09.524
I don't know.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.439
Maybe me.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.573
[elevator bell dings]

26:18.838 --> 26:22.624
McGEE: Some of the stuff
Mason has here is incredible.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.409
You know, I don't think I'm
even authorized to see this.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.455
I know I am not.

26:27.498 --> 26:31.067
Oh... six hours
till the kidnapper's deadline.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.678
We need to find
Mason before then.

26:32.721 --> 26:33.635
This from his place?

26:33.679 --> 26:34.854
Yeah. Tony sent it over.

26:34.897 --> 26:36.159
He's still searching the house.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.379
Now a lot of this
is old information, but,

26:38.422 --> 26:39.728
I mean, Mason has everything

26:39.772 --> 26:41.121
from classified
presidential itineraries

26:41.164 --> 26:42.601
to satellite access
codes in here.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.211
Explains how he was able

26:44.254 --> 26:45.865
to access
our communications network.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.867
It still doesn't explain
why no one ever heard of him.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.825
If you guys ever
need a sounding board,

26:49.869 --> 26:51.871
I have always
been interested in...

26:51.914 --> 26:53.568
GIBBS:
Anything we can use?

26:53.612 --> 26:54.830
Uh... yeah,
the satellite codes.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.398
I can set up
a snooper program.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.008
If Mason tries
to use them again,

26:59.052 --> 27:00.357
we can zero in
on his coordinates.

27:00.401 --> 27:01.837
Mason was on our side, right?

27:01.881 --> 27:03.534
He had to be.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.494
But he appears to have been
retired quite some time.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.191
Kidnappers definitely picked
the wrong girl to ransom.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.932
I mean, imagine
accidentally kidnapping

27:09.976 --> 27:11.542
Jason Bourne's granddaughter.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.457
I'd rather
you imagine where they are.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.721
Abby thinks she might be able
to help with that.

27:15.764 --> 27:18.201
[bells jingling]

27:18.245 --> 27:20.073
Uh, she wants to see you.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.292
Uh, said it was urgent.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.254
[bells jingling]

27:27.297 --> 27:30.126
Sorry, but I'm more
scared of her than you.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.694

27:32.738 --> 27:34.130
Smells like...

The marvels
of modern chemistry.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.486
You flipping burgers, or are
you looking for a kidnapper?

One thing will
lead to the other.

Computer.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.927
[bells jingling]

27:47.970 --> 27:50.103
I made a breakthrough
on the mystery gas

27:50.146 --> 27:52.105
used at the assault
at the school.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.847
I found a recently-filed patent
that contains a very

27:54.890 --> 27:56.631
similar chemical
component.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.589
Speak.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.679
Uh, the patent concerns a scent
delivery system for billboards.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.158
Scented?

28:02.202 --> 28:04.770
Billboards. I mean
what sells better than smells?

28:04.813 --> 28:06.989
Why just show a driver
a big, juicy hamburger

28:07.033 --> 28:08.774
when you can let them
smell it, too?

28:08.817 --> 28:10.645
I mean, admit it.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.386
It's making you
a little hungry.It's not a coincidence.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.518
Oh, no. If you're hungry,
I am taking full credit.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.651
I think Agent Gibbs is
referring to the connection

28:16.695 --> 28:18.218
between the mystery
gas and the patent.

28:18.261 --> 28:19.610
Hey. Shh.

28:19.654 --> 28:23.136
That is definitely
not a coincidence.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.487
There are literally
100 million permutations

28:26.530 --> 28:28.445
of this chemical
component.

28:28.489 --> 28:31.361
So whoever filed the patent is
the same guy who made the gas?

28:31.405 --> 28:32.841
Our chemist,
and I have your printout.

28:34.669 --> 28:38.281
She's scary, but
I like scary.

28:40.153 --> 28:45.114
Tim Greystone from Greystone
Compounding Pharmacy.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.639
Have fun.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.293
Take pictures.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.773
[elevator bell dings]

28:51.817 --> 28:52.731
Hi.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.558
Oh, God. Oh, no.

28:54.602 --> 28:57.387
Don't-Don't go there.

29:00.129 --> 29:02.131
I can't get a good view inside.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.916
Ziva?

29:03.959 --> 29:05.134
Negative.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.180
But it is doubtful
that Rebecca

29:07.223 --> 29:08.921
would be kept
in such a public space.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.226

No, but he's gonna know

29:10.270 --> 29:11.271
how to find her.

29:14.404 --> 29:15.362
Wait a minute.

29:15.405 --> 29:16.580
I got something here.

29:16.624 --> 29:17.625
Probie, you getting this?

29:20.367 --> 29:21.629
It's Mason.

29:21.672 --> 29:22.804
That's not good.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.110
Ziva, McGee, take
the front. Go.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.372
On your six, boss.

29:32.466 --> 29:34.642
NCIS!

29:34.685 --> 29:35.686
You're under arrest.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.646
[grunting]

29:38.689 --> 29:39.647
Release him!

29:39.690 --> 29:41.823
[grunting]

29:41.867 --> 29:43.303
[grunting, glass breaking]Stop it!

29:44.521 --> 29:45.958
McGEE:
Let go!

29:46.001 --> 29:47.437
[door closes]
[sighs]

29:47.481 --> 29:49.048
You're making a mistake.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.789
You're under arrest for murder.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.312
I didn't kill that man.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.879
I suppose
you didn't kill the kidnapper

29:53.922 --> 29:55.097
at the trailer park, either.

29:55.141 --> 29:56.011
And they're not kidnappers.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.536
They're part of my team.

30:02.017 --> 30:05.325
And whoever did kill 'em
is playing us all.

30:13.289 --> 30:17.293
He said, "The kidnappers
are playing all of you."

30:17.337 --> 30:19.469
What's that mean?

30:19.513 --> 30:21.123
That's what we're here
to find out.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.474
What's he looking for?

30:24.518 --> 30:26.128
Way out.

30:26.172 --> 30:29.001
Been like that ever since
we brought him in here.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.960
There's no way anyone
could get out of there.

30:32.004 --> 30:33.962
Shouldn't be,
but if there is,

30:34.006 --> 30:37.357
I'm guessing this is gonna
be the guy who finds it.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.968
[door opens]

30:42.362 --> 30:44.625
We're wasting time.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.888
Who are you?

30:49.760 --> 30:52.328
[sighs]

30:52.372 --> 30:54.330
Okay, now we're
wasting time.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.680
You're not authorized.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.726
Who can authorize me?

30:58.769 --> 31:01.555
The President
of the United States.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.426
[phone beeps]Yeah.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.254
The one buried in Simi Valley.

31:05.298 --> 31:08.518
Out in California.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.303
You said
that you'd do anything to get

31:10.346 --> 31:12.174
your granddaughter back?Anything.

31:12.218 --> 31:14.785
Well, then I need to know
what I need to know.

31:28.321 --> 31:32.194
My team and I were part of
an off-the-books experiment.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.631
A small group of operatives

31:34.675 --> 31:36.851
working within the law,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.287
but outside the chain
of command.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.507
We did the things
that needed to be done.

31:40.550 --> 31:41.769
You understand?

31:41.812 --> 31:43.379
How many?

31:43.423 --> 31:45.947
Eight originally.

31:45.991 --> 31:49.951
When the project was cancelled,
two decades ago,

31:49.995 --> 31:53.172
there were three.

31:54.956 --> 31:57.393
We returned to civilian life,
hid our backgrounds...

31:59.439 --> 32:02.094
were ordered...

32:02.137 --> 32:04.792
never to make contact
with one another again.

32:04.835 --> 32:07.664
Orders you broke.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.579
When my granddaughter
was kidnapped,

32:09.623 --> 32:12.017
I went to my team for help.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.932
My team.

32:20.764 --> 32:24.507
The sedative gas used
at the school...

32:24.551 --> 32:26.945
sounds exactly
like a Greystone creation.

32:26.988 --> 32:31.253
We used it on operations to keep
the casualties at a minimum.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.736
I heard he was selling it
on the black market.

32:35.779 --> 32:39.000
I was hoping
he would help me track a buyer.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.220
So who's the John Doe
in the trailer?

32:41.263 --> 32:44.919
My comm specialist.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.008
Ajax.

32:47.052 --> 32:50.142
I got a cell phone

32:50.185 --> 32:52.535
off that kidnapper
that I fought with.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.711
I brought it to Ajax,

32:54.755 --> 32:56.713
hoping that he would be able
to trace it

32:56.757 --> 32:59.803
exactly like I was supposed to.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.762
So you think the
kidnapping was a setup?

33:01.805 --> 33:03.590
The real target
was your team?

33:03.633 --> 33:05.026
The killers
couldn't have found them.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.898
That's why they grabbed
my granddaughter.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.597
Knew I would lead them
right to my men.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.034
God!

33:13.078 --> 33:15.950
Who would want your team dead?

33:15.994 --> 33:19.388
You're going to need
a stenographer for that list.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.347
We got around.

33:21.390 --> 33:24.045
Look, they were good men.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.963
But my granddaughter is where
I need to be focused right now.

33:31.357 --> 33:34.273
If the ransom was
a diversion...

33:36.449 --> 33:38.929
...then there'd be no need
to keep her alive.

33:42.803 --> 33:46.459
You really think
she's dead?

33:46.502 --> 33:48.374
I don't know.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.161
What are you going
to do?

33:53.205 --> 33:55.642
We're going to do
what we always do.

33:55.685 --> 33:58.340
We're going to catch
the bad guys.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.342
Can you please tell Gibbs
that I need to see him?

34:02.736 --> 34:03.780
Yeah, he's here right now.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.347
I'll tell him.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.741
Boss, no one's willing
to comment on Mason,

34:07.784 --> 34:09.656
but we do have
a request...

34:09.699 --> 34:11.310
[chuckles]
...to drop all the charges.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.833
So drop 'em.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.705
But we...

34:15.749 --> 34:18.317
Dropping all the charges.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.666
Abbs, hi.
Hi.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.320
Hi.
Hi.

34:21.363 --> 34:23.278
So McGee said you
found something?

34:23.322 --> 34:25.106
Not me.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.499
My new number one.

34:29.502 --> 34:32.157
We were processing
Mason's impounded vehicle

34:32.200 --> 34:33.245
and we found two things.

34:33.288 --> 34:36.117
First...

34:36.161 --> 34:39.468
it smells like French fries,
and second...

34:39.512 --> 34:43.385
I noticed the fuel
line had a small tear.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.995
How'd that get there?

34:45.039 --> 34:47.868
Not by accident,
but when the gas leaked

34:47.911 --> 34:49.783
onto the engine block
and exploded,

34:49.826 --> 34:51.306
it would have made it look
like one.

34:51.350 --> 34:54.135
The killer was saving
Mason for last.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.137
And thought that the fire
would destroy

34:56.181 --> 34:58.748
all the evidence,
but it did not.

34:58.792 --> 34:59.314
So you got his fingerprints?

34:59.358 --> 35:01.099
Oh, yeah.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.191
ZIVA:
Walter Carmichael--

35:06.234 --> 35:08.323
at least that's
what he calls himself now.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.978
He's the substitute teacher
for Rebecca's school.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.066
Mason says he was
a member of his team.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.763
Handled long-term
counterespionage.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.200
Was killed
in Sri Lanka in '87.

35:15.243 --> 35:16.636
ZIVA: At least
that's what everyone thought.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.072
GIBBS:
Where is he now?

35:18.116 --> 35:19.421
After the attack
in the school, he said

35:19.465 --> 35:21.293
he needed to take
some time off to recuperate.

35:21.336 --> 35:22.859
I guess what he meant by that

35:22.903 --> 35:24.731
was "hunt down and kill
some old friends."

35:24.774 --> 35:26.950
BOLO.
On it.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.604
McGee's already at his place
with a forensics unit.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.345
The girl
was not there.

35:30.389 --> 35:31.868
Motive.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.131
Revenge maybe?

35:33.174 --> 35:36.264
Perhaps, uh, he felt betrayed
by his team.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.745
Could be some kind
of bounty on their heads.

35:38.788 --> 35:40.050
We want to find
this girl,

35:40.094 --> 35:43.315
we gotta figure out
what's making this guy tick.

35:44.707 --> 35:47.057
Where is he going?

35:47.101 --> 35:49.234
To talk
to our resident watchmaker.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.984
I had a hunch I'd be
seeing you shortly.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.423
You want to know if the
girl is still alive.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.989
No, I want to know
how to get

36:06.033 --> 36:07.817
the girl back
alive, Duck.

36:07.861 --> 36:10.777
Yeah, well, I've been going
over Carmichael's records.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.997
It's safe to assume that
everything before 1987

36:14.041 --> 36:15.216
was falsified.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.304
That a problem?

36:16.348 --> 36:17.827
No, quite the opposite.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.612
I-I find how Mr. Carmichael

36:19.655 --> 36:22.484
chose to reinvent himself
most telling.

36:22.528 --> 36:25.879
He chose to be
a missionary

36:25.922 --> 36:27.315
in Cameroon
for 12 years.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.230
Then he invented
documents

36:29.274 --> 36:31.101
to show that he
worked in a hospice.

36:31.145 --> 36:33.930
Finally, he settled
as a teacher.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.889
Left out the part
about 50 kills in 40 countries.

36:35.932 --> 36:38.370
By design.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.981
I believe that Carmichael
grew to regret his past

36:41.024 --> 36:42.461
as a member of Mason's team

36:42.504 --> 36:44.941
and-and wanted to
atone for his sins.

36:44.985 --> 36:48.945
When storytelling was not
enough to cleanse his soul,

36:48.989 --> 36:51.078
he turned to more
drastic means.

36:51.121 --> 36:55.213
McGee sent these over
from Carmichael's house.

36:55.256 --> 36:58.346
It's a collection of
the more popular tools

36:58.390 --> 37:00.653
of self-flagellation.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.264
Catholic cilice,
Kavadi skewers;

37:03.308 --> 37:06.049
I mean, they've
all been used.

37:06.093 --> 37:07.442
Yeah, when that
wasn't enough?

37:07.486 --> 37:10.184
His final act of penance--

37:10.228 --> 37:13.056
the execution of all
of his old teammates

37:13.100 --> 37:15.624
to make amends for all
of the horrible things

37:15.668 --> 37:16.712
they did together.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.410
Duck, what about the girl?

37:18.453 --> 37:19.976
What about Rebecca?

37:20.020 --> 37:22.718
Well, unfortunately,
Carmichael believes

37:22.762 --> 37:24.981
that he has a higher
power on his side,

37:25.025 --> 37:26.809
which makes him
capable of anything.

37:26.853 --> 37:28.071
Unfortunately...

37:28.115 --> 37:29.290
[door hisses open, then closes]

37:29.334 --> 37:31.161
...you're not going
to know her fate,

37:31.205 --> 37:33.686
until his mission
is accomplished.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.340
Gibbs, it's Carmichael.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.125
He wants to talk.

37:38.168 --> 37:39.344
He's early.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.998
I think he has given up
the ransom charade.

37:42.042 --> 37:43.739
He knows we have Mason.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.785
He's willing to trade.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.090
What are you going to do?

37:49.267 --> 37:51.834
I'm gonna give him
what he wants.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.316
[phone beeps]Yeah, this is Gibbs.

37:57.405 --> 37:59.233
[engine roars, tires screech]

38:15.249 --> 38:17.207
Are these cuffs necessary?

38:17.251 --> 38:18.731
Carmichael
demanded it.

38:18.774 --> 38:21.429
We gotta make him think
we're playing along.

38:21.473 --> 38:24.040
Yeah, well, right now
I'd make that trade for real.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.564
Well, we want him alive,

38:25.607 --> 38:28.001
not stuffed face first
into a Cuisinart.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.002
Ziva.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.569
In position.

38:30.612 --> 38:34.834
Well, okay, we're here.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.052
Where's the
guest of honor?

38:36.096 --> 38:37.315
He's here.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.142
Are you sure about that?

38:39.186 --> 38:40.709
Oh, of course he's sure.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.668
He trained me.

38:43.843 --> 38:46.062
Hello, Nicholas.

38:49.675 --> 38:52.417
Slow down here.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.854
If you shoot me,
you'll never find Rebecca.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.769
And I kill you slowly.

38:56.812 --> 39:01.426
I-I deserve no less...
right after you.

39:01.469 --> 39:05.081
Agent Gibbs, you are
to release Mason to me.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.606
We will leave
in my vehicle.

39:07.649 --> 39:10.391
In an hour I will phone you
with the girl's location.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.697
Yeah, what
about Mason?

39:11.740 --> 39:13.002
Oh, I...

39:13.046 --> 39:14.874
his fate is out
of my hands, I...

39:14.917 --> 39:17.746
I'm just an instrument
of justice.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.749
Your elevator never
went to the top floor.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.664
How do we know
the girl's still alive?

39:22.708 --> 39:24.231
It's called faith.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.146
You nut job.
GIBBS:
Stand down, Mason.

39:26.189 --> 39:30.280
I want proof that she's alive
right now, or you die.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.457
It's your granddaughter
who's going to die.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.328
She's already dead.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.809
Alive, she screws up
your operation.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.463
I trained you, remember?

39:38.506 --> 39:40.290
I said stand down, Mason.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.380
He killed her,
I know it, you bastard.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.382
[grunts]

39:44.425 --> 39:46.122
GIBBS:
No!
[bystanders shouting]

39:49.387 --> 39:52.651
"The righteous shall rejoice
when he seeth the vengeance.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.436
He shall bathe his feet
in the blood of the wicked."

39:55.480 --> 39:56.698
Why'd you take a shot?!

39:56.742 --> 39:58.091
Mason was going to shoot!

39:58.134 --> 39:59.919
CARMICHAEL:
The girl--

39:59.962 --> 40:01.442
she's in the trunk.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.056
[grunts]

40:07.100 --> 40:08.536
Pick it.
[muffled screaming]

40:14.063 --> 40:15.325
You're all right, Rebecca.REBECCA: Thank you.

40:15.369 --> 40:16.718
Everything's gonna
be okay now.

40:16.762 --> 40:19.460
Got you.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.027
The girl's alive.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.420
Of course.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.074
Wanton collateral damage
is one of our sins.

40:25.118 --> 40:26.641
She's an innocent.

40:28.774 --> 40:32.038
What am I, chopped liver?

40:32.081 --> 40:32.952
[sobbing]:
Grandpa.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.650
Grandpa.

40:35.694 --> 40:38.044
Babe.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.567
I was so scared.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.395
MASON: Everything is
going to be all right.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.747
Thank you.

40:45.791 --> 40:48.315
Could have used a guy
like you on my team.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.709
We could still use
a guy like you.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.450
But, but...

40:52.493 --> 40:54.408
Corn syrup.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.543
Blanks.

41:01.328 --> 41:02.938
CARMICHAEL:
You have no honor, any of you.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.244
TONY:
You know what you got?

41:04.287 --> 41:05.985
Taken down
by Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.247
Holla!
What?

41:07.290 --> 41:07.987
Clear a path,
clear a path.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.467
Make room, people.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.555
You know,
I've always been interested

41:10.598 --> 41:12.121
in the investigative branch
of NCIS.

41:12.165 --> 41:13.906
So that's it?

41:13.949 --> 41:16.082
The happy ending?

41:16.125 --> 41:18.127
Not exactly.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.347
There's the happy ending.

41:21.827 --> 41:24.046
Mom, Dad.

41:24.090 --> 41:26.353
LISA:
Oh, baby, I was so worried.

41:26.396 --> 41:28.181
I am so glad to see you.REBECCA:
Grandpa saved me.

41:28.224 --> 41:29.269
That's, uh...

41:31.010 --> 41:33.142
McGEE: Feels nice,
doesn't it?

41:33.186 --> 41:34.143
Welcome home.

41:34.187 --> 41:36.581
I could get used to it.

41:36.624 --> 41:38.191
Not sure I could get used
to the pay.

41:38.234 --> 41:40.193
[chuckles]

41:40.236 --> 41:43.457
But for the sake of curiosity,
if I wanted to, um...

41:45.807 --> 41:48.549
What's this?

41:48.593 --> 41:52.727
Application for
a full internship here at NCIS.

41:54.163 --> 41:56.165
GIBBS: Yeah, it's
all filled out.

41:56.209 --> 41:59.212
It just needs your signature.
