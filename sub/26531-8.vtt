a thousand lives,

10:43.309 --> 10:45.518

10:47.184 --> 10:49.934

sucked up all my serotonin,

11:02.226 --> 11:04.518

11:04.600 --> 11:06.976

and probably a good heart,

11:07.059 --> 11:09.850

I mean, that's slamming.

you don't love me.

11:21.684 --> 11:24.059

11:26.226 --> 11:29.393
- What about my poetry?

11:29.476 --> 11:32.101
- Uh-huh.

11:32.184 --> 11:33.892
- Are you 100%?

11:33.976 --> 11:37.434
- Please, let's just go.

11:41.017 --> 11:42.892
- When I was a teenager...
- Mm.

11:42.976 --> 11:45.976
- I had this best friend
named Sue.

11:46.059 --> 11:47.476
I mean, that's what
we called each other,

11:47.559 --> 11:50.518
but we were way more
than that.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.600
She was my first love.

11:53.684 --> 11:55.934
Mm, we used to dance

11:56.017 --> 11:57.184
to Tiffany

11:57.268 --> 12:00.101
and watch "Who's The Boss?",

12:00.184 --> 12:02.892
and we finger-banged each other
underneath an afghan throw

12:02.976 --> 12:04.600
that her grandma
had crocheted

12:04.684 --> 12:07.142
that said "Hope is an act
of faith" on it. [chuckles]

12:07.226 --> 12:09.184
- Hope and faith
are the same thing.

12:09.268 --> 12:10.642
- Shh.

12:10.725 --> 12:12.600
Shh, no, listen.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.476
I loved her.
I loved her so much.

12:18.976 --> 12:22.476
She saw me,
and I saw her, and...

12:22.559 --> 12:25.600
together,
we were the whole world.

12:28.434 --> 12:30.600
One day,

12:30.684 --> 12:32.226
Sue was walking home
from the grocery store

12:32.309 --> 12:33.476
on the side of the road

12:33.559 --> 12:34.976
that didn't have
a shoulder on it,

12:35.059 --> 12:37.892
and she got hit by a car,

12:37.976 --> 12:40.017
and she died instantly.

12:40.101 --> 12:42.142
- This is a horrible story.

12:42.226 --> 12:44.934
- I know, I know, but...

12:45.017 --> 12:48.850
the point is...

12:48.934 --> 12:51.642
I mean, I never thought
I would get over it.

12:53.309 --> 12:55.142
I was 16 years old,
and so everybody said,

12:55.226 --> 12:56.934
"Well, give it time."
I mean, you know?

12:57.017 --> 12:58.184
So I did.
I gave it a week,

12:58.268 --> 12:59.434
I gave it a month,

12:59.518 --> 13:01.309
I gave it a year,

13:01.393 --> 13:03.393
and I thought, "This is it.
This is gonna kill me.

13:03.476 --> 13:05.142
I will die from this."

13:07.309 --> 13:09.393
But every day,

13:09.476 --> 13:11.642
I would wake up,
and I wouldn't be dead.

13:13.017 --> 13:15.059
And I kept not dying,

13:15.142 --> 13:17.351
and I kept not dying...

13:19.892 --> 13:23.142
Until one day, I was
finally sure I was alive.

13:25.434 --> 13:27.226
Do you know how long that took?

13:27.309 --> 13:29.184
- How long?
- Ten years.

13:31.017 --> 13:34.476
But the point is,
is that it happened.

13:34.559 --> 13:36.600
It happened, and now I get
to be alive.

13:36.684 --> 13:38.351
You know?

13:38.434 --> 13:39.892
You thought of that?

13:39.976 --> 13:41.725

14:38.476 --> 14:42.268

tanning booth operator by now.
