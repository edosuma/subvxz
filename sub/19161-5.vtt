00:01.461 --> 00:02.712
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:03.129 --> 00:06.007
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

00:06.216 --> 00:09.302
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom</i>

00:09.511 --> 00:10.679
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

00:11.096 --> 00:12.889
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

00:13.098 --> 00:14.683
<i>You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?</i>

00:14.891 --> 00:16.309
Why does she need
to leave town?

00:16.518 --> 00:18.103
Because it's what's best.

00:18.311 --> 00:20.146
I'll pack up my things,
I'll be gone by morning.

00:20.563 --> 00:23.441
It's the only piece
of property in my name
and not your father's.

00:24.484 --> 00:25.986
- Can I
get you anything?
- A job.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.446
I can't very well have
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

00:28.655 --> 00:31.282
on trial for fraud
and embezzlement,
balancing my books.

00:31.491 --> 00:32.409
Oh, Hiram...

00:33.284 --> 00:34.619
Where's the rest of it?

00:34.828 --> 00:36.705
I saw you with that biker guy.

00:36.913 --> 00:39.499
Your father hired
the Southside Serpents.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.292
Nice murderboard, Dad.

00:43.003 --> 00:44.587
Who did this?

00:52.303 --> 00:53.638
<i>Every town has one.</i>

00:53.847 --> 00:56.182
<i>The spooky house
that all the kids avoid.</i>

00:56.391 --> 00:59.853
<i>Ours was Thornhill,
the Blossom family's mansion,</i>

01:00.270 --> 01:01.980
<i>with its very own graveyard.</i>

01:02.605 --> 01:04.566
<i>And, trapped within its walls</i>

01:04.774 --> 01:07.986
<i>like some gothic heroine,
was Cheryl Blossom.</i>

01:08.194 --> 01:11.114
<i>Still grieving for her
beloved brother, Jason.</i>

01:12.032 --> 01:15.118
<i>Linked in death
even as they were in life.</i>

01:43.980 --> 01:45.148
I told you, Cheryl.

01:46.357 --> 01:48.526
No more sleeping
in Jason's bed.

01:49.486 --> 01:51.863
I... I was
working on the eulogy.

01:52.072 --> 01:53.907
- For Jay-Jay.
- Don't bother.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.827
You won't be speaking
at his memorial.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.582
God knows what you'd say.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.502
Something to humiliate us?

02:11.466 --> 02:12.467
No.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.904
- Hey, Rocky.
- Hey.

02:33.446 --> 02:36.449
You know, I never thought
I'd say that I miss you
playing guitar, but...

02:36.658 --> 02:37.992
Ah. Sorry, Dad.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.203
Just trying to get back
in fighting shape
for the field.

02:41.121 --> 02:43.164
So, this is all for football?

02:43.706 --> 02:46.501
Coach Clayton's about to set
the starting line-up,
name a new captain.

02:47.252 --> 02:49.754
It's like you said.
Football gets me
a scholarship,

02:49.963 --> 02:52.298
which gets me to college,
where I can study music.

02:54.259 --> 02:55.718
Captains get scholarships.

03:06.479 --> 03:08.940
This is how my dad
had his Jason Blossom
murder board

03:09.149 --> 03:10.275
before it was trashed.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.278
Any leads on who did that?
Or what they were looking for?

03:13.486 --> 03:15.196
Nope. No fingerprints.

03:15.864 --> 03:17.949
But they stole
a bunch of files,
background checks,

03:18.158 --> 03:20.994
and all the video
and audiotapes
of police interviews.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.706
Hey, Betty...

03:24.914 --> 03:26.416
Trev, hi!

03:27.041 --> 03:29.627
- Sorry to interrupt...
- Oh, no... Uh, it's okay.

03:29.836 --> 03:32.672
- We're just, uh, working on...
- Our murder board.

03:37.051 --> 03:40.305
Well, I just wanted to
make sure we're still
on for tomorrow?

03:40.513 --> 03:41.764
Absolutely, it's a date.

03:43.474 --> 03:46.352
I mean, I'll...
I'll see you there. Bye.

03:46.561 --> 03:48.354
- So, I'll see you. Bye.
- So... Bye.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.565
Going on a date with Trev?

03:51.191 --> 03:52.609
Does Mama Cooper
know about that?

03:52.817 --> 03:54.527
Kev, I'm not on house arrest.

03:56.487 --> 03:59.741
Okay, she's out of town
at a Women in Journalism
spa retreat.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.160
Anyway, it's not
a "date" date.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.996
You just called it a date.

04:05.205 --> 04:06.664
You literally said,
"It's a date."

04:06.873 --> 04:08.333
That's just my cover.

04:08.541 --> 04:11.085
Really, it's an intelligence
gathering mission.

04:11.294 --> 04:14.797
We should focus on
the one thing we have access
to that your dad doesn't.

04:15.006 --> 04:17.175
The kids at Riverdale High.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.677
You know, maybe Trev knows
something about Jason
he didn't think was important.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.203
Damn it!

04:49.958 --> 04:50.959
Andrews...

04:53.044 --> 04:54.254
What the hell was that?

04:57.465 --> 04:58.800
Where were you, Andrews?

04:59.592 --> 05:00.885
Because you weren't on
my field just now.

05:01.094 --> 05:02.178
I'm sorry, Coach.

05:03.805 --> 05:04.764
Mantle!

05:05.598 --> 05:06.557
Sup, Coach?

05:07.558 --> 05:08.601
You wanna be captain?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.271
Hell yeah, I do.

05:13.523 --> 05:15.817
Then this here is what we call
a horserace, fellas.

05:16.276 --> 05:18.653
Now, you got a week to show me
who wants top spot more.

05:20.655 --> 05:21.614
Good luck.

05:24.284 --> 05:26.286
- Look, Reg...
- Save it, Andrews.

05:26.828 --> 05:30.081
If anybody deserves
to be captain and wear
Jason's number, it's me.

05:30.748 --> 05:31.833
Not you.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.346
Your usual. Turkey on rye,
hold the tomatoes, to-go.

05:45.555 --> 05:48.933
Great. Can I get
a huge cup of coffee to go?

05:49.517 --> 05:51.436
I'm running on little
or no sleep.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.896
Archie. Up all hours.

05:54.564 --> 05:57.025
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we should take another stab

05:57.233 --> 05:58.401
at going on a date.

05:59.027 --> 06:00.778
So, what do you say?
Dinner?

06:04.824 --> 06:07.869
Fred, um... I'm married.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.538
And you are, too.

06:11.122 --> 06:12.665
I'm... I'm confused here.

06:12.874 --> 06:14.667
So, the drive-in...

06:14.876 --> 06:17.628
That wasn't a date?

06:20.173 --> 06:22.425
Totally my bad.
I gotta go.

06:23.134 --> 06:24.969
Hey, Fred, wait.

06:25.178 --> 06:26.763
It's all good.
I'll catch you later.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.771
Betty, you're positively
radiating Nicholas Sparks.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.647
Tell me everything
about this Trev.

06:36.856 --> 06:38.149
Oh, there's nothing to tell.

06:38.358 --> 06:41.235
Just one of Betty's sources,
there's nothing
romantic in the offing.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.820
Why is everything weird here?

06:43.029 --> 06:44.989
Why can't a date
just be a date?

06:45.698 --> 06:48.326
What about you, Archie?
How's life in a PG world?

06:49.911 --> 06:52.747
PG. Post-Grundy.
What, too soon?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.209
Coach Clayton says
I have a shot at being
varsity captain.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.753
So I'm not thinking about
anything else right now.

06:59.337 --> 07:00.755
And you're back
to being boring.

07:00.963 --> 07:04.592
Are you, maybe, throwing
yourself into football as
a way to avoid your feelings.

07:04.801 --> 07:06.260
I'm not avoiding
anything, Betty,

07:06.469 --> 07:08.137
I'm trying to get
my life back on track.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.056
I can help with that.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.682
I know Ms. Grundy
was tutoring you.

07:11.891 --> 07:13.226
Understatement of the year.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.020
But there's this
amazing songwriter
from New York,

07:16.229 --> 07:17.855
who's an adjunct
at Carson College?

07:18.064 --> 07:19.357
Incredible mentor.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.692
He does some coaching
on the side
and I told him about you.

07:21.901 --> 07:22.944
You wanna meet him?

07:23.152 --> 07:25.279
Yeah, yeah I'd love to,
but football...

07:25.446 --> 07:27.532
No, Archie can.
And he will.

07:28.199 --> 07:30.493
Call him if you want,
but do it soon.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.495
His spots fill up fast.

07:32.703 --> 07:33.621
Thank you, Val.

07:37.417 --> 07:40.711
Hey, now you have zero excuse
for avoiding music.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.674
Sorry to interrupt
Sad Breakfast Club,

07:44.882 --> 07:48.261
but I'm here to formally
invite you to Jason's memorial
at Thornhill this weekend.

07:52.056 --> 07:54.892
To my surprise and chagrin,
mother added you
to the guest-list.

07:55.101 --> 07:58.187
In case you're tempted
to steal our silver
candlesticks, don't.

07:58.396 --> 07:59.856
We'll be searching bags.

08:03.359 --> 08:06.863
Hey, try to remember,
she is burying her brother.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.451
Cheryl, wait.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.829
You're in pain.
This is a horrible week
for you.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.789
I'm sure it's why
you're being
particularly obnoxious.

08:16.998 --> 08:19.167
- Maybe. What's your point?
- Look, I don't want
to be locked

08:19.375 --> 08:21.002
in a catfight-to-the-death
with you.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.587
That only ends in one way.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.213
Mutual annihilation.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.300
- Agreed.
- So, can't we just...

08:27.508 --> 08:30.887
Be friends?
Or, at least, frenemies?

08:31.095 --> 08:33.806
If you really want to
extend an olive branch,

08:34.724 --> 08:36.267
come to a sleepover
I'm having.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.061
Fine.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.938
Sure. When?

08:41.147 --> 08:42.690
The night before the memorial.

08:45.485 --> 08:47.737
I don't want to spend
the night before I bury
my brother alone.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.560
Hi, Mr. Castillo?

09:20.686 --> 09:21.979
Yeah, my name's
Archie Andrews.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.439
I'm a friend of Valerie's.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.662
Talk to me about your music.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.498
I started writing songs
this summer, Mr. Castillo.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.667
- Oscar.
- Oscar.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.877
After this kid
at my school died.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.754
It's his...
It's his funeral this week.

09:48.506 --> 09:50.550
Actually, the first song
I wrote was about him.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.051
How many hours a day
do you spend writing?

09:52.260 --> 09:53.386
At least a couple.

09:54.262 --> 09:55.471
That's going to
have to change.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.515
I know. And it will.
Once football season's over.

09:57.723 --> 09:58.724
Football season?

09:58.933 --> 10:00.810
Yeah, I play...
I play football,
is that a problem?

10:01.018 --> 10:01.811
You tell me.

10:02.019 --> 10:05.106
Before I sold my first song,
I was in the studio all day.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.358
Waitering and bartending
all night.

10:07.567 --> 10:10.111
There's no short-cuts,
unless you're a prodigy.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.655
Definitely not a prodigy.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.450
Do you have any songs
I can hear?

10:16.659 --> 10:17.952
Yeah, yeah.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.789
Where are your sheets?

10:22.248 --> 10:23.165
Your sheet music?

10:25.209 --> 10:26.544
I don't teach performance.

10:27.587 --> 10:29.213
I teach song writing.

10:29.422 --> 10:31.716
I focus on craft,
composition, lyrics.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.051
To even talk about your songs
in a constructive way,

10:34.260 --> 10:35.553
we need to be
on the same page.

10:35.761 --> 10:38.389
Like, on actual pages.

10:38.598 --> 10:40.099
Okay, I'll write out
my songs.

10:40.308 --> 10:41.225
For tomorrow.

10:42.018 --> 10:42.810
Tomorrow?

10:48.733 --> 10:52.445
Jason's memorial will be
held in this room.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.030
Before he's laid to rest

10:54.238 --> 10:56.616
in the cemetery
on Thornhill's grounds.

10:57.617 --> 10:59.744
We've invited
everyone on our list.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.245
What list is that?

11:01.454 --> 11:03.039
List of suspects, of course.

11:04.582 --> 11:06.292
People with
grudges against us,

11:06.500 --> 11:09.086
many of them members of
Riverdale's founding families,

11:09.295 --> 11:10.254
I'm sorry to say.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.799
Someone in this town
killed Jason.

11:14.592 --> 11:16.093
You know,
that's our thought, too.

11:16.302 --> 11:17.637
Since whoever broke into
my house

11:17.845 --> 11:18.971
knew that I'd be
at the drive-in.

11:19.180 --> 11:22.516
Which means, there's
a very real possibility

11:22.725 --> 11:25.436
Jason's murderer
will soon be in this room.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.939
That's why you've invited
the Lodges and everyone else?

11:29.982 --> 11:31.484
To investigate them?

11:34.570 --> 11:36.447
And you think I'm manipulative
and heartless

11:36.656 --> 11:38.282
and making this
all about myself?

11:44.664 --> 11:46.332
I think it's great
what you guys
are doing for Jason.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.834
You two were on the
water polo team together.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.586
Were you guys close?

11:51.921 --> 11:53.673
This is just us talking,
right?

11:54.507 --> 11:57.259
Just because, I kind of
feel guilty about it.

11:59.679 --> 12:01.889
A few months ago,
Jason started acting all,

12:02.098 --> 12:03.224
like, weird and secretive.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.267
Do you know why?

12:06.310 --> 12:09.355
I thought it was about
your sister, to be honest.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.190
They'd been dating a few weeks
when he changed.

12:11.399 --> 12:13.734
Changed in what way?

12:13.943 --> 12:15.111
We stopped hanging out,

12:15.319 --> 12:16.862
he wouldn't call me back,
and then...

12:17.780 --> 12:19.365
Then he started selling off
all his stuff.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.784
Anything he could
sell for cash,
he was hawking.

12:23.661 --> 12:24.912
Then I heard he was
dealing drugs...

12:25.121 --> 12:26.831
What drugs?

12:27.039 --> 12:28.541
Weed, pills, whatever.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.625
I don't know for sure,

12:29.834 --> 12:31.085
because by then
he stopped talking to me.

12:32.044 --> 12:35.673
And all this started
after Jason and Polly
got together?

12:47.435 --> 12:49.061
Great. Now write it down.

12:49.729 --> 12:52.356
Musical notation. Not in tabs.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.943
It's kind of obnoxious,
but Oscar's right.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.656
You catch on quick, newbie.

13:01.741 --> 13:03.701
Hey son, time to...

13:03.909 --> 13:05.536
Uh, hey.

13:05.745 --> 13:07.371
Hi. I, uh...

13:07.580 --> 13:09.373
I'm... I'm his old man.

13:09.582 --> 13:11.208
- Yeah, I'm Fred.
- Dad, this is Val.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.626
Val, my dad.

13:12.835 --> 13:16.297
Val. Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Val. Valerie.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.841
Right,
<i>Josie and the Pussycats.</i>
Oh, I'm a big fan.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.469
I... Yeah, I saw you guys
at Taste of Riverdale.

13:21.677 --> 13:23.345
And you were rocking hard.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.055
Thanks, Mr. Andrews.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.683
Actually, Dad,
we're in the middle of
some music stuff, so...

13:29.602 --> 13:31.437
Oh, right. Yeah.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.273
I'm gonna just close this,
not all the way.

13:34.482 --> 13:36.233
Yeah, um...

13:36.442 --> 13:37.902
Thanks, Dad. Goodbye.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.707
Hey, good timing.

13:51.916 --> 13:54.668
Why don't you grab
a wrench and tighten up
that hose for me?

13:59.757 --> 14:00.633
Dad,

14:02.218 --> 14:05.304
every time I ask Mom
about Polly,
she shuts me down.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.726
Can we please talk about it?

14:13.062 --> 14:13.938
What happened?

14:14.146 --> 14:16.190
What did Jason do
that was so bad?

14:19.944 --> 14:21.403
Jason and Polly had a fight.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.116
I don't know
what it was about,

14:26.325 --> 14:28.619
but afterwards,
Polly was pretty devastated.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.415
And I came home from work
one day and I...

14:35.251 --> 14:37.586
I heard the water running
in the bathroom upstairs.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.631
I went upstairs,
I knocked on the door,

14:40.840 --> 14:43.384
I asked if Polly
was all right, and...

14:45.094 --> 14:46.554
She didn't say anything.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.765
So I kicked the door down.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.645
Polly was trying to
hurt herself, Betty.

14:56.856 --> 14:58.440
That's why we sent her away.

15:00.109 --> 15:02.444
To stop her from trying to
take her own life again.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.789
Betty, I'm sorry.

15:14.540 --> 15:15.666
That's hardcore.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.043
I asked my dad
if I could call Polly.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.545
He said she was doing better.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.715
But then, when she heard
about Jason's death,
she had a big setback.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.718
He doesn't want to
risk another one.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.469
Why does a rich kid
sell drugs?

15:27.678 --> 15:29.513
He was running away
from his parents.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.640
Yeah. Probably.

15:32.850 --> 15:33.976
Or drug dealers.

15:34.727 --> 15:36.520
Oh, my God.
Is that possible?

15:37.521 --> 15:38.606
It's a theory.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.441
Yours is more likely.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.068
But why would he have
to run away from
mommy and daddy?

15:43.277 --> 15:45.404
Because they're monsters.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.948
Yeah, but why,
specifically.

15:48.449 --> 15:50.367
Well, we can't exactly
just ask them.

15:51.327 --> 15:52.786
So we have to ask Jason.

15:54.455 --> 15:57.708
Are you proposing
a seance or...

15:57.917 --> 16:00.294
No. Dead men tell no tales.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.047
But their bedrooms,

16:04.548 --> 16:05.633
their houses...

16:06.967 --> 16:09.553
Bulldog twenty-five, on two.
Bulldog twenty-five, on two.

16:09.762 --> 16:10.888
- Ready?
- Break!

16:22.399 --> 16:24.777
Red 32. Red 32.

16:25.361 --> 16:26.320
Ready?

16:27.363 --> 16:28.322
Hut! Hut!

16:32.493 --> 16:34.244
Other side. Go left.

16:43.963 --> 16:44.922
Hut!

17:03.399 --> 17:05.609
Well done, Andrews.
Great hustle.

17:08.862 --> 17:09.822
Ah!

17:17.538 --> 17:19.498
- What's wrong with your hand?
- Nothing. It's fine.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.292
- You're not playing
with a busted hand.
- I said it's fine, Reg.

17:22.835 --> 17:25.004
Archie, sit this one out,
you'll thank me later.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.714
Are you really
that scared of me?

17:27.297 --> 17:30.509
Fellas, are we going to
chit-chat or we going to play?

17:30.718 --> 17:31.719
Let's play.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.223
Okay. Fine,
it's your funeral.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.077
Isn't this your playing hand?

17:58.662 --> 17:59.872
Archie.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.874
This hand is your instrument.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.834
You need to take
better care of it.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.588
And, you know,
stop punishing yourself
while you're at it.

18:08.172 --> 18:10.090
- I'm not.
- You sure?

18:10.758 --> 18:13.177
I got slammed because
I didn't know the play.

18:13.844 --> 18:16.388
I didn't know the play
because, like an idiot,

18:16.597 --> 18:19.475
instead of memorizing my plays
I was up late last night.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.019
Working on some of my songs
with Valerie.

18:22.895 --> 18:24.521
God, I'm such an idiot.

18:25.230 --> 18:25.981
Valerie, huh?

18:28.984 --> 18:30.360
No, I endorse this.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.653
You jealous, Ronnie?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.447
Please.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.366
I had my seven minutes
in heaven
with Archie Andrews.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.123
Okay. Good as new.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.376
But try to take
better care of it.

18:47.503 --> 18:50.047
That hand is going to be
worth millions one day.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.854
These are... fine.

19:06.063 --> 19:07.397
I was up all night.

19:07.606 --> 19:08.982
Yeah, I can tell.

19:09.483 --> 19:12.903
Your sheets are
sloppy, rushed.

19:13.612 --> 19:14.655
Okay.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.281
I listened to your songs.

19:16.615 --> 19:19.034
I think they're, uh, juvenile.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.411
They're repetitive.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.873
- They're break-up songs.
- Yeah, right.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.000
- But Ms. Grundy said that...
- Grundy.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.294
She was your music teacher?
One who left?

19:31.421 --> 19:33.841
This is hard to hear,
and for me to say, but,

19:34.049 --> 19:35.175
I think she must've...

19:35.884 --> 19:37.886
Connected with you
in a way that I just
don't see us doing.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.640
Wait, are you...

19:41.849 --> 19:42.933
Is that it?

19:43.142 --> 19:44.101
You're saying
I should just quit?

19:44.309 --> 19:45.519
I'm saying that...

19:47.646 --> 19:48.981
I don't think I can help you.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.367
Thank you for having me.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.912
Cheryl invited you.

20:04.121 --> 20:05.873
I have no idea
why you're here.

20:06.790 --> 20:07.749
Me neither.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.210
I thought there'd
be other girls.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.547
Nana Rose, would you
like some more ham?

20:19.094 --> 20:21.138
Veronica, would you like
some more maple ham?

20:21.346 --> 20:23.682
I'm good.
It's delicious, though.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.851
You can really
taste the maple.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.396
You do know that
Riverdale was founded on
the maple syrup industry.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.274
I didn't, actually.
Fascinating.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.526
That's where Sweetwater River
got its name.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.655
Perhaps you should
ask your father
about it, sometime.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.491
How is he, by the way?

20:43.035 --> 20:43.660
Okay.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.079
There are worse things
than prison.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.414
Like this dinner party.

20:47.623 --> 20:48.540
What did you say?

20:53.712 --> 20:54.671
Hmm.

20:59.718 --> 21:02.262
It must have been
hard for you.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.350
Watching your father being
handcuffed and dragged
out of your home

21:06.558 --> 21:09.186
in front of you
and your neighbors.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.021
All those reporters.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.527
The worst part is
how fast it happened.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.199
He was just, gone.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.410
I didn't even get
a chance to say goodbye.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.830
That's why I think
it's so great.

21:29.039 --> 21:31.250
You're all getting a chance
to say goodbye
to Jason tomorrow...

21:31.458 --> 21:32.751
Not all of us.

21:33.126 --> 21:36.046
That's because some people
already got to say
goodbye to Jason.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.633
While rowing him
across the river

21:41.343 --> 21:42.552
to his death.

22:02.781 --> 22:03.740
Hello?

22:36.189 --> 22:37.941
Daddy! Seriously?

23:03.467 --> 23:04.968
- Polly?
- Dad...

23:18.065 --> 23:19.733
<i>Stop filming me!</i>

23:20.901 --> 23:23.153
<i>Say hi to the camera, Polly.</i>

23:23.362 --> 23:25.197
<i>I can't practice with you watching!</i>

23:26.365 --> 23:27.991
<i>Daddy, I'm shy!</i>

23:37.376 --> 23:41.380
I hope this isn't weird, but
Jason was crazy handsome.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.131
The handsomest.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.093
Something tells me
he would've liked you.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.223
Why did you invite me tonight?

23:51.431 --> 23:54.893
Why not Tina? Or Ginger?
Aren't they your besties?

23:55.102 --> 23:57.312
And yet,
that night at the pep rally,

23:57.521 --> 23:59.022
after I had my panic attack,

23:59.940 --> 24:01.108
you helped me.

24:02.776 --> 24:03.860
Not them.

24:05.404 --> 24:07.239
Cheryl.

24:09.658 --> 24:12.035
You're allowed to say
goodbye to your brother.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.664
- But, why does it
have to be...
- In front of people?

24:16.373 --> 24:17.165
Yeah.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.586
Everything with Jason's
been so...

24:22.754 --> 24:25.090
Public. Everyone
has an opinion.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.883
Has been gossiping.

24:27.092 --> 24:29.928
Saying he got
what he deserved,
or that he didn't.

24:30.595 --> 24:33.098
I just... I want everyone
to know that I'm...

24:34.933 --> 24:36.059
I'm sorry.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.439
And that Jason deserved a...

24:42.607 --> 24:44.818
A better family
than what he got.

24:45.026 --> 24:47.821
Then do it. I'll help you.

24:48.321 --> 24:52.242
And let Penelope
and Clifford Blossom
do their worst.

24:52.826 --> 24:53.869
Oh, they will.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.122
They'll kill me.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.806
I am here for you, whenever.

25:15.015 --> 25:18.351
But why didn't you
call the cops
or animal control services?

25:22.272 --> 25:23.356
It was a message...

25:24.649 --> 25:26.735
...for me
from the Serpents.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.739
I didn't call the police
because I don't trust them.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.158
I don't trust half the people
in this damn town.

25:33.909 --> 25:34.951
Just you.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.330
Which is why you gotta
tell me why the Serpents...

25:38.538 --> 25:39.664
It's Hiram.

25:40.707 --> 25:41.875
He owes them money.

25:42.751 --> 25:43.877
How much money?

25:44.085 --> 25:47.672
No, Fred. That's between
Hiram and the Serpents.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.884
Thank you so much
for coming here tonight.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.471
But I don't want to get you
any more involved
than you already are.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.068
You ready to enter
the belly of the beast?

26:13.114 --> 26:14.574
It was the best I could do.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.419
Hi.

26:29.965 --> 26:33.093
Penelope, I just want to
offer my condolences.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.595
Hermione, that's so kind.

26:35.804 --> 26:36.721
Hmm.

26:38.682 --> 26:41.268
You think you're
so clever coming here
and offering your pity?

26:41.935 --> 26:44.688
- What are you talking about?
- So you've come to gloat?

26:45.397 --> 26:48.233
With warmest regards
from your husband I'm sure.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.117
You ready?

26:58.118 --> 26:59.119
Just about.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.496
You go ahead.
I'll be down.

27:02.289 --> 27:03.123
Okay.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.810
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Blossom.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.480
I thought you might
want to have this.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.111
You're so much like him.

27:40.076 --> 27:43.580
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you, Archibald.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.342
Did she just touch your hair?

27:56.343 --> 27:58.261
That was really sweet
what you did.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.764
She deserves it.
More than I do.

28:05.352 --> 28:07.437
Days like today really put
things in perspective, huh?

28:08.730 --> 28:11.608
I mean, at least we're here.

28:12.567 --> 28:13.860
At least we're alive.

28:21.951 --> 28:23.370
Got to pace yourself, Hal.

28:23.578 --> 28:26.414
Be very unseemly to get
a DUI on your way home.

28:26.623 --> 28:27.540
Wouldn't you think?

29:01.783 --> 29:04.077
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.840
Welcome to Thornhill.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.008
Thank you all for coming.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.136
If you'll kindly
take your seats.

29:24.639 --> 29:26.266
I'd like to start the memorial

29:27.684 --> 29:29.686
with a few words about Jason.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.858
You are only going
to make things worse.

29:49.330 --> 29:50.999
The last time I saw Jason,

29:52.041 --> 29:53.376
I was wearing this dress.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.173
I know it's impossible.

29:58.381 --> 29:59.424
But I swear,

30:00.258 --> 30:01.593
when I put it on, it...

30:02.469 --> 30:04.053
It feels like
he's in the room with me.

30:11.186 --> 30:14.773
Even though we were twins,
I used to demand
I have my own birthday party.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.193
Until one year,
out of the blue,

30:18.401 --> 30:20.945
Jason convinced me we had to
combine them into one.

30:21.613 --> 30:23.573
It wasn't until years later,
I found out why.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.785
It was because no one
wanted to come to mine.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.454
And Jason
didn't want me to know.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.289
He protected me.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.542
Every single day.

30:36.753 --> 30:39.130
I wish, that day at the river,
I had protected him.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.806
I'm so sorry, Jay-Jay.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.559
We failed you. All of us.

31:07.617 --> 31:10.620
I think we'll adjourn now
to the Winter Salon

31:10.829 --> 31:12.247
for a light supper.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.299
Hey.

31:24.843 --> 31:27.095
- Hey.
- I didn't think you were
going to make it.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.639
Yeah, I got off a little
late from work, but, um...

31:29.848 --> 31:31.391
I did wanna pay my respects.

31:31.599 --> 31:32.308
Yeah.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.187
Also, I realized
something last night.

31:37.313 --> 31:40.024
The bookkeeping position
at my company
that you applied for?

31:40.233 --> 31:41.401
It's still open.

31:42.235 --> 31:44.404
No snakes.
If you're interested.

31:44.612 --> 31:45.947
Yes, yes, yes.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.620
Um, thank you.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.205
Yeah.

32:15.894 --> 32:19.272
Is it me or did
the temperature just drop
like it does in horror movies?

32:20.398 --> 32:22.108
That's just the icy chill
of the dead.

32:25.695 --> 32:28.031
Where does a teenage boy
hide things?

32:28.615 --> 32:32.076
Under the mattresses,
maybe in the drawers,

32:32.285 --> 32:34.662
behind the headboard,
in the closet.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.507
- Hello.
- Holy...

32:50.428 --> 32:52.555
I'm so sorry,
we were just leaving.

32:52.764 --> 32:55.850
Oh. It's you.

32:56.059 --> 32:59.062
How lovely to see you again.

32:59.270 --> 33:02.774
Come closer, I wanna get
a good look at you.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.693
The horror. The horror.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.157
Come closer, Polly dear.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.832
It's nice to
see you again, too.

33:20.625 --> 33:24.671
I'm sorry it had to be under
such terrible circumstances.

33:25.129 --> 33:27.131
Well, of course
you're not wearing it.

33:27.340 --> 33:30.051
- God bless.
- Wearing what?

33:30.259 --> 33:32.220
The ring, Polly.

33:32.428 --> 33:36.975
That ring has been
in the Blossom family
for generations.

33:37.183 --> 33:41.312
You keep it close
to your heart, always.

33:41.521 --> 33:45.900
But don't tell Penelope
I gave it to you.

33:46.109 --> 33:50.905
Or she'll likely come and
snip it off your finger!

33:52.573 --> 33:53.950
I won't, I promise.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.786
Such a shame.

33:57.328 --> 34:01.165
Your wedding
was the last thing
I was living for.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.293
I lost a grandson,

34:05.003 --> 34:06.087
but you,

34:06.921 --> 34:10.508
you've lost the love
of your young life.

34:10.967 --> 34:13.011
Poor child.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.345
Excuse me.

34:15.805 --> 34:16.806
I have to...

34:17.807 --> 34:18.891
I can't...

34:25.481 --> 34:27.942
I had to. It's what Jason
would've wanted.

34:28.151 --> 34:31.279
No, Cheryl. As always,
it's what you wanted.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.784
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

34:39.787 --> 34:41.080
'Cause after tonight,

34:42.999 --> 34:44.959
there will be
no more River Vixens.

34:46.127 --> 34:50.173
And if not for the fact
that no one would have you,

34:50.381 --> 34:54.135
I'd be shipping you off
to a boarding school
in Europe tonight.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.524
What if
Ms. Grundy was lying?

35:08.733 --> 35:11.277
People lie all the time.
Maybe she didn't want to
hurt my feelings.

35:11.486 --> 35:13.029
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

35:13.237 --> 35:14.447
Castillo doesn't think
I have the chops.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.324
So, Ms. Grundy said
you were good,

35:16.532 --> 35:18.076
and you thought
you were good?

35:18.284 --> 35:19.994
Castillo says you are bad,
and now you think you're bad?

35:21.454 --> 35:22.371
I just...
I want to get this right.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.623
You wouldn't understand.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.875
Who wouldn't? You want me
to wallow with you?

35:26.084 --> 35:27.418
I don't have time.

35:27.627 --> 35:29.921
You have a band
backing you up, Val.
It's not that easy...

35:30.129 --> 35:32.215
No, Archie, it's hard.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.050
It's almost impossible.

35:34.258 --> 35:35.885
But let me ask you this
right now.

35:36.094 --> 35:38.096
Who's telling you
you can't do your music?

35:38.304 --> 35:39.639
Your coach?

35:39.847 --> 35:41.682
Mr. Castillo? Your dad?

35:42.725 --> 35:43.851
Or is it just you?

35:49.732 --> 35:52.902
You dragged me out
of the Blossom house,
and then

35:53.111 --> 35:55.238
you don't talk to me
the whole way home.

35:55.613 --> 35:57.532
Dad, Jason and Polly
were engaged.

35:59.242 --> 36:00.159
Did you know that?

36:02.078 --> 36:03.371
Oh, my God.

36:05.748 --> 36:07.375
Of course you did.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.837
Is that what you
and Clifford Blossom
were talking about?

36:11.045 --> 36:13.256
That is none of your business.

36:13.464 --> 36:15.883
Yes, it is my business.

36:16.092 --> 36:19.053
So stop avoiding it
and just tell me
what's going on.

36:20.596 --> 36:23.182
Clifford and I were arguing

36:23.391 --> 36:26.102
because he
and his filthy clan

36:26.310 --> 36:29.105
came this close to
destroying our family.

36:30.148 --> 36:33.234
Your little friend Cheryl's
great-grandfather...

36:36.612 --> 36:38.489
...murdered yours, Betty.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.199
Why?

36:40.408 --> 36:42.118
The same reason
they do everything.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.703
Greed and hate.

36:48.833 --> 36:51.210
They were in
business together.

36:51.419 --> 36:53.838
Selling and trading
maple syrup.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.299
And one day
great-grandfather Blossom

36:56.507 --> 36:58.759
decided that he didn't
want to share the profits.

37:00.636 --> 37:04.140
So he murdered my grandfather
in cold blood.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.392
That's why you hated Jason?

37:07.393 --> 37:11.147
Because of some blood feud
that happened before
you were even born?

37:11.355 --> 37:13.733
They stole our
livelihood, Betty.

37:13.900 --> 37:16.986
And I'd die before I let them
steal my daughter, too.

37:17.195 --> 37:19.363
- Where is she?
- She is sick!

37:20.907 --> 37:22.950
And Jason made her sick.

37:25.328 --> 37:29.498
And she's not coming home
until she isn't sick anymore.

37:29.707 --> 37:32.460
Fair warning. Stay out of it.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.391
There's not a lot of love lost
between your dad and Clifford.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.435
Or me and Penelope,
for that matter.

37:51.354 --> 37:52.647
Still, that family...

37:52.855 --> 37:55.191
to lose a child that young...

37:55.399 --> 37:56.651
That way...

37:56.943 --> 38:01.906
I just spent the last 24 hours
in the gothic horror story
that is Cheryl Blossom's life.

38:03.991 --> 38:05.993
And it just reminded me
how lucky I am.

38:07.119 --> 38:10.248
To have a mom who protects me.

38:15.795 --> 38:19.590
Then I need to tell you about
something that happened
last night at Pop's.

38:27.598 --> 38:30.893
I saw a lot of fire and hustle
from both of you this week.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.354
It was almost
too close to call.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.614
Reggie, your time will come.

38:45.157 --> 38:46.617
But for this season, at least,

38:47.576 --> 38:51.372
this is a new number,
seeing that you took it upon
yourself to retire Jason's.

38:52.206 --> 38:54.875
Which was the right call.

38:55.376 --> 38:58.754
You know exactly
what a captain should
and would do.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.386
Dude, are you insane?
Take the jersey.

39:05.594 --> 39:08.264
I... can't.

39:09.015 --> 39:10.349
I can't, Coach.

39:13.769 --> 39:15.479
I love playing football,

39:15.688 --> 39:19.483
but your starting line-up
deserves a captain whose
only love is football.

39:20.443 --> 39:21.694
Someone like Reggie.

39:21.902 --> 39:22.820
What?

39:24.196 --> 39:27.033
I mean, yeah.

39:28.701 --> 39:29.952
What? You're quitting
on me, Andrews?

39:30.161 --> 39:33.122
No, and I really hope
you don't cut me, Coach.

39:33.331 --> 39:34.707
Cause I friggin'
love being a Bulldog.

39:36.292 --> 39:39.337
But that part of me that
I would have to give to you
if I were captain,

39:40.671 --> 39:42.840
I gotta save that
for something else.

40:04.695 --> 40:06.113
<i>Every town has one.</i>

40:06.322 --> 40:09.617
<i>The house on the haunted hill
all the kids avoid.</i>

40:09.825 --> 40:11.952
<i>Now that Jason was
buried in the earth,</i>

40:12.161 --> 40:13.788
<i>it would only be
a matter of time</i>

40:13.996 --> 40:16.457
<i>until something
poisonous bloomed.</i>

40:17.041 --> 40:20.378
<i>In that long, cold shadow
cast by his death.</i>

40:25.007 --> 40:28.761
<i>Whatever grew in the rich
black soil of
the Blossom's garden</i>

40:28.969 --> 40:30.888
<i>always found its way
to the town.</i>

40:31.097 --> 40:34.892
<i>Whether it was murder.
Or love. Or secrets.</i>

40:36.185 --> 40:37.144
<i>Or lies.</i>

40:37.353 --> 40:38.854
Juggie, I feel like
I don't even know

40:39.063 --> 40:40.773
who my mom and dad
are anymore.

40:41.774 --> 40:42.858
Betty...

40:46.237 --> 40:49.240
if your parents
lied about Jason and Polly,

40:49.990 --> 40:52.034
there's probably more
that they lied about.

40:54.537 --> 40:55.871
What do you mean?

40:56.080 --> 40:59.125
Your dad said he would do
anything to protect Polly.

40:59.333 --> 41:01.168
So the next logical
question is...

41:01.377 --> 41:03.212
How far would he go
to protect her?

41:09.009 --> 41:10.136
Jughead,

41:11.262 --> 41:13.472
whoever broke into
Sheriff Keller's house

41:13.681 --> 41:16.142
and stole all his evidence
wasn't at the drive-in.

41:27.528 --> 41:29.280
My Dad wasn't at the drive-in.

41:47.631 --> 41:49.175
We need to talk to Polly.
