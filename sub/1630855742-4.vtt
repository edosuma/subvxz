01:59.411 --> 02:00.537
Hey.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.706
Kyle, here we go.

02:09.295 --> 02:12.799
My saving grace.
Where would we be without Retta?

02:12.799 --> 02:14.301
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.513
Thank you, all.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.766
- All right. Here we go.
- I mean,

02:20.766 --> 02:21.850
- I know I'm shticky--
- Hey, Cory.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.144
- Hey!
- Ladies and gentlemen, here we go.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.312
Here we go.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.522
Let's sing for our supper.

02:26.522 --> 02:27.731
- Yeah.
- Run up the bill.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.650
We're hungry. We're gonna kill it.

02:41.411 --> 02:45.457
Hi, everybody. How's it going?

03:00.681 --> 03:03.851
The UBA pooch!

03:09.064 --> 03:10.274
Hello, Bradley.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.612
<i>UBA, am I right?</i>

03:15.612 --> 03:17.906
What a privilege. I salute you.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.034
- Thank you for your service to UBA.
- Thank you, sir.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.372
This is the show. I love it. Great energy.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.092
Thank you.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.683
You're gonna have your work
cut out for you.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.310
Let it rip.

03:48.478 --> 03:52.816
<i>Here at UBA, we've been hearing
the word "canceled" a lot.</i>

03:52.816 --> 03:55.444
<i>And I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm starting to freak out a little bit.</i>

03:55.444 --> 03:58.447
<i>I'm just saying. When I hear people
talking about</i> The Donner Party<i>,</i>

03:58.447 --> 04:02.659
<i>I can't be sure if they're talking about
our number one hit drama series</i>

04:02.659 --> 04:04.703
<i>or lunch at the commissary.</i>

04:04.703 --> 04:07.080
- Knock knock.
- Baby's first upfronts.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.792
God, I miss COVID.
Can't we just do all of this on Zoom?

04:11.293 --> 04:13.504
Come on, it's tradition. It's fun.

04:13.504 --> 04:17.089
It's a thousand ad execs from Chicago
binge eating takeout from Flavortown.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.885
Stella, don't be a snob.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.596
Fine. You ready?

04:22.596 --> 04:23.597
Yep.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.681
- Okay, good to go.
- Great.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.309
My best self. Thank you.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.687
Look, this is all, like,
a necessary evil, right?

04:30.687 --> 04:35.609
It's the beautiful thing
about bullshit. It can't be outsourced.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.320
<i>...institutional racism, and I'm like,</i>

04:38.320 --> 04:40.697
<i>"Yeah, the writing was on the wall</i>

04:40.697 --> 04:42.407
<i>when they canceled</i> Basketball Wives<i>."</i>

04:42.407 --> 04:46.620
<i>'Cause that shit was good.
And then the suits, they always say,</i>

04:47.120 --> 04:49.665
<i>"Black people don't sell well overseas."</i>

04:49.665 --> 04:53.669
<i>And I'm like, "Really? 'Cause it seems
to me we sold well for centuries."</i>

04:54.461 --> 04:57.339
<i>Yeah, I said it. But y'all did it.</i>

04:58.674 --> 05:00.008
Wow, she's amazing.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.385
- <i>Who's worse?</i>
- Yeah.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.761
Do you have eyes on the Ellipse boys?

05:02.761 --> 05:05.722
Yeah, they're out there.
Looking bored out of their minds.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.892
- Are you ready to lock this shit down?
- <i>...a lot of sketchy shit...</i>

05:08.892 --> 05:11.436
If I get them to commit
to $300 million in ad sales,

05:11.436 --> 05:13.397
- I want a raise and a Birkin bag.
- <i>...because one old white lady...</i>

05:13.397 --> 05:15.190
- Oh, well, I'll do you one better.
- <i>...wrote Aunt Jemima.</i>

05:15.190 --> 05:18.861
If you get 'em to commit to $300 million,
we all get to keep our jobs.

05:19.903 --> 05:20.988
<i>Does no one remember...</i>

05:20.988 --> 05:24.074
We don't get our loan
unless the ad boys pony up.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.410
Now if you don't think you can
pull it off, I can send Leonard.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.454
- Trust me, I've got this.
- <i>...and his sext messages...</i>

05:29.454 --> 05:32.291
All right, well, singing a song of
gladness and cheer.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.668
Hi. Two minutes till you're on.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.836
Knock 'em dead.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.921
Thank you.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.010
Thanks, Retta.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.221
Secretly, I've been dreading this. Nah.

05:46.221 --> 05:50.642
Thanks, Retta. Secretly--
"Hey, I've been s--" I've been secretly--

05:50.642 --> 05:53.562
Thanks, Retta.
I've been secretly dreading this.

05:54.563 --> 05:58.233
Thanks, Retta.
I've been secretly dreading this.

06:02.446 --> 06:06.575
Thanks, Retta.
I've been secretly dreading this.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.707
And now, the man behind the curtain.

06:13.707 --> 06:18.212
Some call him captain of the Titanic,
others Napoleon at Waterloo.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.381
I call him the man who definitely
did not cut the brake lines

06:21.381 --> 06:22.841
in Mitch Kessler's car.

06:23.926 --> 06:28.722
Please give it up for UBA's CEO,
Cory Ellison.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.649
Oh, shit. Hey, Napoleon.

06:38.649 --> 06:39.566
Hi.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.778
I didn't see my docuseries
on your fancy sizzle reel this morning.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.905
- Oh, my.
- Are you not picking up the show?

06:45.531 --> 06:47.616
Are you asking me as talent
who needs placating

06:47.616 --> 06:50.494
- or as a partner with a vested interest?
- Don't fuck with me. Speak English.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.912
Just tell me what's happening.

06:54.206 --> 06:57.251
We are flirting with financial disaster.

06:58.836 --> 07:01.088
Okay, so does that--
You are not picking up the show?

07:01.672 --> 07:04.049
The God's honest truth,
I haven't made a decision about that.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.634
I have to see how things go this week.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.178
What is going on?
Are we in that much trouble?

07:08.178 --> 07:12.182
It is dire, Alex. <i>No bueno.</i>

07:13.559 --> 07:16.353
Okay, I'm s-- I'm very confused.
I am very confused.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.189
I thought you were all in with Paul Marks.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.732
Oh, no. That deal is toast.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.442
- It's toast? What?
- Yeah.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.944
I guess he didn't like
being cucked by you.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.656
Okay, first of all, I didn't cuck anybody.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.324
Oh, yeah, that was a cucking.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.410
And believe me
when I tell you, the male ego is fragile.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.662
Some guys aren't into that kind of thing.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.790
Especially if you've spent the last
20 years reinventing jet propulsion.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.042
But if you wanna help keep the lights on,

07:39.042 --> 07:44.381
we could use your considerable
superpowers to woo some ad execs tonight.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.931
I wooed all morning, but okay.

07:53.891 --> 07:57.686
I will woo. I'll keep wooing
till the cows come home.

07:59.897 --> 08:00.898
- Thank you.
- Sure.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.532
Hey, will you do me a favor?

08:10.532 --> 08:13.911
Sure. Here are your pants for tonight
for Cory's Hamptons thing.

08:13.911 --> 08:17.497
Oh, right. Will you find out
if Paul Marks is in town?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.583
I was sure I was gonna see him
this morning.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.919
Yeah, I heard he was going
to the <i>YDA</i> party.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.212
He's staying at the Mercer.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.047
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.548
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:44.483 --> 08:49.196
<i>Unfortunately, NBN's very own
Laura Peterson was implicated</i>

08:49.196 --> 08:53.492
<i>in UBA's hack.
Unsurprisingly, no dick pics.</i>

08:54.785 --> 08:59.748
<i>But we did find unreleased photos of
Laura and Bradley gone wild.</i>

09:00.541 --> 09:02.209
<i>Sorry, I meant in the wild.</i>

09:02.793 --> 09:06.547
<i>I mean, by the looks of it, we're in for
a</i> Sound of Music <i>lesbian reboot.</i>

09:08.298 --> 09:10.300
<i>My hills are alive just thinking about it.</i>

09:26.358 --> 09:27.943
Hey. How are you?

09:27.943 --> 09:30.112
Hey, I'm good.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.573
Who would've ever thought
we were aspirational?

09:33.824 --> 09:36.660
I know.
We should design a line of bonnets.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.329
I'd be willing to open
an Etsy store with you

09:39.329 --> 09:41.039
if you come to Cory's party later.

09:41.540 --> 09:45.169
I thought maybe we could catch up.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.337
I-- okay.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.800
Yeah, I mean, if I can sneak away
later from our skate party.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.844
Things are a little crazy
around here right now.

09:53.844 --> 09:58.307
Oh, really? I always thought NBN had
their shit together, unlike this asylum.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.102
No, we just put up a really good front.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.022
I'm sorry. I have to run.
I'm late for a Q and A

10:05.022 --> 10:08.275
<i>on legacy media in the digital age.
Good times.</i>

10:08.275 --> 10:10.819
Oh, yeah, okay. Well, I'll see you later.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.281
Maybe.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.284
Hey, Bradley.
Mia was hoping you had a minute.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.368
Oh, yeah. Sure.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.794
Yeah. I understand. Thank you.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.215
Hey, I wanna interview the train conductor
from the subway shooting.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.508
- You good with that?
- Yeah, sure.

10:32.508 --> 10:34.635
I have a slot for it
on Thursday after Awkwafina.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.053
Have Layla chase it while we're at Cory's.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.055
Do I really have to go to this party?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.642
It's gonna be fun.
I mean, we'll get tipsy.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.478
- We'll talk shit about everybody.
- We can just do that here.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.397
- I...
- Okay.

10:48.357 --> 10:50.192
Hey, are you going to the Hamptons?

10:50.192 --> 10:52.903
Pack snacks. It's a long-ass drive.
What's up?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.031
There's been a bombing in Mariupol.
It's gonna be a big story.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.742
The international news desk
won't send a correspondent.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.203
Everybody is scared because of
what happened to that French news crew.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.288
But if we can be the first
to break this, Bradley--

11:03.288 --> 11:04.540
- What do you need?
- I need a fixer.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.250
Someone who can at least
get my photographer in.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.127
And since you were there in February,
I thought maybe you might have someone.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.172
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I have this guy, Pavlo. He's--

11:12.172 --> 11:14.800
His English isn't great,
but he's pretty reliable.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.262
Thanks. I know this is a bit off-book,
but--

11:18.262 --> 11:22.432
Please. I'm tap dancing for ad executives
while people are dying in Ukraine.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.309
Let's do this.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.437
How'd it go this morning?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.481
Well, they were--

11:29.481 --> 11:32.150
seem really excited about the dog
with superpowers show,

11:32.150 --> 11:35.696
but meanwhile there's zero interest
in our Texas abortion documentary.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.613
Yikes.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.282
Here he is.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.496
Pavlo, It's Bradley Jackson.

11:44.997 --> 11:48.125
Yes, from UBA.
I'm here with my colleague, Mia Jordan.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.212
I'm sorry.
Is there someone who speaks English?

12:10.105 --> 12:11.315
Is that it?

12:11.315 --> 12:12.399
Okay, bye.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.985
- What? I--
- Oh, right. My--

12:14.985 --> 12:16.570
I did not know you spoke Russian.

12:16.570 --> 12:20.157
My father was stationed in Berlin
in the '80s, and I studied Russian.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.074
It's a long story.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.452
That is wildly impressive.
And how come I didn't know?

12:23.952 --> 12:25.287
Do you pull that out on dates?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.080
What's a date?

12:28.916 --> 12:31.168
He wants $2,500. I'm calling André.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.642
- Hello?
- Hey. How are you?

12:46.642 --> 12:47.726
Hey.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.479
You calling about the hospital bombing?

12:53.232 --> 12:55.776
Yeah, I got a guy
who can get you in Mariupol.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.946
Fan-fucking-tastic.
How soon can he be here?

12:58.946 --> 13:00.739
Well, I can get you his info
as soon as we're off,

13:00.739 --> 13:02.282
but I need you
to understand the risk here.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.659
<i>Yeah, yeah. I agree to all the terms...</i>

13:03.659 --> 13:05.661
- André, I'm serious.
- <i>...and conditions.</i>

13:05.661 --> 13:07.246
From what I'm hearing, it's a shit show.

13:07.246 --> 13:09.623
So you are assuming all liability.

13:09.623 --> 13:13.293
<i>Under no circumstances can you say
that you are working with UBA.</i>

13:13.293 --> 13:16.547
- I'll take it to the grave.
- But no body bags for you, okay?

13:17.339 --> 13:19.842
Fine, I'll live.
Just please get me in there.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.136
Okay. More soon. Bye.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.184
What?

13:30.435 --> 13:31.436
Nothing.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.355
Nothing at all.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.192
Stop, Bradley.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.577
Revenue's down 23% year to date.

13:46.577 --> 13:50.122
That's a 16 bil market cap,
and your credit ratios are in free fall.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.499
Well, nah, it's really more of
a controlled dive.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.585
We're gonna do a barrel roll.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.421
Hit the thrusters.
Climb back up to 30,000 feet.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.632
Ad revenue's 46% of your business.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.343
We're willing to engage
if you can beat last year's spend.

14:03.343 --> 14:07.431
Given what's been going on at UBA,
that seems implausible.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.891
Well, what is implausible is that

14:08.891 --> 14:13.520
<i>Men of the Ice Age</i> averages
7.2 million viewers in its fifth season.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.397
They just discovered fire last week.

14:15.397 --> 14:19.443
That ice storm lasted 2.5 million years
and so will we.

14:19.443 --> 14:22.905
But to your point,
my most capable lieutenant, Stella Bak,

14:23.405 --> 14:26.450
she's locking down ad commitments
as we speak.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.160
We will have the money. Trust me.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.663
In this line of work,
trust is a euphemism for fucked.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.584
But hey, happy to be surprised.

14:36.502 --> 14:39.254
You let us know if you get there.
We'll be ready to underwrite the loan.

14:40.214 --> 14:41.882
In the meantime, enjoy your party.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.176
I heard you snagged
that stunner on West End.

14:44.176 --> 14:47.304
- Yeah, early pandemic buy.
- Good for you.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.557
We should get a round in
at Maidstone sometime.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.725
That sounds great.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.686
Yeah, of all the anti-Semitic clubs,
that one's my favorite.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.481
Well, some older members belong.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.858
Mayflower Jews.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.778
See, this is the problem with New America.
It's the same menu.

15:02.778 --> 15:06.365
- Petit filet. King salmon.
- No lobster tagliolini.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.576
Drew was really hoping
you'd take us to Carbone.

15:10.285 --> 15:14.122
Carbone, seriously?
Carbone is where you take your wife.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.168
You get my wife
to eat anything even resembling a carb,

15:18.168 --> 15:20.003
and you can have my fucking job.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.424
Good afternoon. I'm Erica.
I'll be taking care of you today.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.801
- I feel better already.
- Yeah.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.388
Can I get you started on drinks
while you're looking at the menus?

15:29.388 --> 15:30.347
- Yes, please.
- Yeah.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.975
We will actually start
with an order of the Hamachi Crudo,

15:32.975 --> 15:38.230
the yellowfin tuna tartare
and the full caviar service.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.733
And I will have a Grey Goose martini.
Dirty. Three olives.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.235
- Two of those.
- Okay.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.153
Stella?

15:45.904 --> 15:48.365
Bombay Sapphire.
Up, with a twist. And keep 'em coming.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.785
Okay. Damn the torpedoes, right?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.453
- I like this woman.
- Yeah.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.873
- I heard you guys could drink.
- I guess we'll find out.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.416
We sure will.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.878
This'll be fun.

16:34.703 --> 16:35.746
Hi.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.664
Hi.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.292
Did you hire some ex-Mossad
to stalk me or something?

16:40.292 --> 16:44.171
Well, if by ex-Mossad
you mean my assistant, then yes.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.469
- Yeah. Cory send you?
- God, no.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.471
Because if this
is some kind of elaborate ploy

16:52.471 --> 16:54.681
to rope me back into the fold,
I am not interested.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.477
Well, why don't you
get in the car and find out?

16:58.477 --> 17:02.022
While I appreciate the ambush apology,
I do actually have plans.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.148
Okay, the <i>YDA</i>--

17:03.148 --> 17:06.401
Are you seriously going
to the <i>YDA</i> ice-skating thing?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.365
I swear,
I'm not stalking you. People talk.

17:11.365 --> 17:12.449
Yeah, I know they do.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.617
Especially when a $40 billion deal
is on the line.

17:17.246 --> 17:22.626
Just get in the car.
I have a suborbital surprise for you.

17:26.755 --> 17:27.798
You are relentless.

17:28.507 --> 17:31.677
You don't wanna show up to those things
while people are still sober.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.807
All right, Levy. Let's see what you got.

17:39.685 --> 17:43.021
- Oh, no. Who's that?
- Yeah, that's Howie, my security.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.607
Well, can you tell Howie to stand down?

17:45.607 --> 17:48.443
I mean, it's SoHo.
You really think I'm kidnapping you?

17:49.027 --> 17:50.946
Well, believe it or not,
it wouldn't be the first time.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.368
Wow. Instantly just got more interesting.

18:16.388 --> 18:19.766
- All right. How we doing?
- Great. Everything is pretty much set.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.645
We're gonna have to move the raw bar.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.480
I thought you wanted it
next to the cocktail tables.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.358
Well, we can't have the oysters
languishing in the sun.

18:28.358 --> 18:34.281
The sunset is at 7:38,
280 degrees Northwest.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.909
Salmonella isn't sybaritic, Kendra.

18:36.909 --> 18:38.619
- We're on it.
- Good.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.038
Sixty minutes, people.
This is fun. Let's go!

18:51.256 --> 18:52.299
Yes. Thank you.

18:53.592 --> 18:57.221
So how do we know UBA+
isn't another CBN+ situation?

18:57.221 --> 18:58.931
It barely has any programming.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.599
What does CBN+ have?

19:00.599 --> 19:04.394
<i>Alex Unfiltered</i> reached
an unprecedented number of households,

19:04.895 --> 19:07.981
put UBA+ on the map,
and we've only grown from there.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.317
My wife subscribed for Alex.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.986
She made her book club read Alex's memoir.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.698
She has a lot of theories
about Alex's divorce.

19:17.491 --> 19:19.243
Thought she should've ended up
with Chip Black.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.620
Well, she's still America's sweetheart.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.455
Didn't seem sweet in Maggie Brener's book.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.917
Maggie took her shot. No one gave a shit.
Where is she now?

19:27.501 --> 19:28.502
Still.

19:29.837 --> 19:33.131
Some of our clients
have concerns about brand affinity.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.008
It seems like every week
there's a new scandal.

19:36.927 --> 19:41.056
But your wife, she's all in, right?

19:42.850 --> 19:44.434
I think she likes the mess.

19:44.434 --> 19:49.022
A lot of people do. Post-hack,
our web traffic increased 250%.

19:49.022 --> 19:53.443
Scandals get clicks. That's an organic
migration from web to streaming.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.154
Prying eyes became subscribers.

19:56.154 --> 19:59.324
So I would lock this shit down
before the number gets any higher,

19:59.324 --> 20:01.577
and we stop giving you
a friends-and-family discount.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.789
Wow, I like you, Stella.
You're surprising.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.712
But you see, I'm gonna need
another drink to think it over. So...

20:12.713 --> 20:13.547
Yes.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.507
- Another round?
- You read my mind.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.723
Excuse me. Need the ladies'.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.478
Hey.

20:30.606 --> 20:33.567
I'd be eternally grateful
if you could bring water instead of gin.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.777
These guys are impossible to keep up with.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.404
- No problem.
- Thanks.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.999
I'm setting a 90-minute timer,
then I'm gone.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.460
I'll swim back to Manhattan if I have to.

20:51.960 --> 20:57.090
You are not leaving me alone
in this palace of sadness.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.136
It does kinda scream,

21:01.136 --> 21:03.430
"Really, I'm fine being single."

21:08.936 --> 21:10.896
- All right.
- Come on in.

21:10.896 --> 21:11.980
Thanks.

21:20.906 --> 21:22.115
Excuse me one second. Hi.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.284
Hey. Your place looks great.

21:24.284 --> 21:27.037
Oh, yeah. I made a few additions
since you were last here.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.872
You mean the ad execs
don't come with the house?

21:28.872 --> 21:31.708
That group of mouth breathers
in the vintage Men's Warehouse

21:31.708 --> 21:33.836
could really use
the Bradley Jackson razzle-dazzle.

21:33.836 --> 21:35.170
You wanna go say hi? Good. Thank you.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.220
Hi.

21:44.096 --> 21:45.097
I'm Bradley Jackson.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.306
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet--

21:46.306 --> 21:48.267
<i>Next ride. Welcome.</i>

21:49.101 --> 21:50.477
<i>The one and only Coney Island.</i>

21:55.148 --> 21:59.361
So this place was called Astroland,
and the whole park had a space theme.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.405
- I see.
- And I worked here

22:01.405 --> 22:02.990
the summer before college.

22:02.990 --> 22:06.159
Turned down an internship
at <i>The New Yorker</i>

22:06.159 --> 22:08.287
to salt margarita glasses.

22:08.287 --> 22:10.205
Well, your parents must've been so proud.

22:10.998 --> 22:14.793
My father, he said if he'd known
he was raising a cocktail waitress,

22:14.793 --> 22:16.753
he would've never bothered
to teach me to read.

22:17.504 --> 22:20.299
Well, is that what this is then?
Is this a walk down memory lane?

22:20.299 --> 22:23.969
No, no. I act--
I really just wanted to apologize.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.805
I'm so sorry I bailed on the launch.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.726
- I was just so pissed.
- Right, so what was that about?

22:32.728 --> 22:35.731
It had nothing to do with you. Nothing.

22:36.231 --> 22:38.150
Kinda felt like it had
an awful lot to do with me.

22:38.150 --> 22:41.486
I know. I'm sorry. I just have such--

22:43.363 --> 22:46.742
I have a very complicated history
with UBA.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.539
Men trying to...

22:54.208 --> 22:55.542
control my destiny.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.085
And that is not on you.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.839
And you were right when you said
we should take some time

23:00.839 --> 23:03.425
to get to know each other,
and I screwed that up.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.137
Well, that was back when there
was a deal on the table.

23:07.137 --> 23:08.222
That ship has sailed.

23:11.058 --> 23:13.435
Well, has it?

23:15.479 --> 23:16.522
I mean, you're here.

23:20.317 --> 23:21.360
Under duress.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.118
I really--

23:41.171 --> 23:44.049
Well, your suborbital surprise
awaits you, sir.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.176
Really?

23:46.760 --> 23:49.054
Come on, I owe you a ride. Let's go.

23:49.054 --> 23:52.140
- Let's have some fun.
- I hate standing in lines.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.060
Oh, my goodness.
It's barely a line, moneybags.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.604
Moneybags? Like you do
your own grocery shopping.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.022
And you do yours?

23:59.022 --> 24:00.691
- No, I have a farm.
- You do?

24:00.691 --> 24:02.484
It's completely self-sustainable.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.444
What do you grow, Bitcoin?

24:06.989 --> 24:07.990
All right.

24:08.532 --> 24:10.993
Strap in. Here we go.

24:14.872 --> 24:17.040
Passed up a ride on my rocket for this?

24:18.458 --> 24:20.836
Regrets, I've had a few.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.686
...chambers and the senators
running for their lives.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.688
I actually--
I didn't see the Vice President.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.690
I was in a different part
of the building, but--

24:41.690 --> 24:43.650
Well, you're covering-- right?

24:43.650 --> 24:45.777
You kinda know anything new
that's going on?

24:45.777 --> 24:47.905
Well, there's different, you know, things.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.573
- Indictments, you know--
- So sorry to interrupt.

24:49.573 --> 24:50.490
Yeah.

24:51.366 --> 24:52.743
Can I borrow Bradley for a minute?

24:52.743 --> 24:54.286
Yeah. Of course.

24:54.286 --> 24:57.247
- Hey. My daughter's a big fan.
- Thanks. Nice meeting you all.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.295
Oh, my God. Thank you.

25:03.295 --> 25:04.755
I could hear you dying inside.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.176
Well, you better be careful
or we're gonna end up on <i>Page Six</i>.

25:11.303 --> 25:12.971
I'm really surprised you came.

25:12.971 --> 25:15.224
Well, you know,
it beats the <i>YDA</i> skate-athon.

25:15.224 --> 25:18.727
- Audra, drunk, on ice is a lot.
- She's a lot.

25:20.521 --> 25:21.855
And I wanted to see you.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.108
Laura.

25:25.108 --> 25:27.486
- Mia.
- Hey. How are you?

25:27.486 --> 25:28.987
Never better.

25:28.987 --> 25:32.449
Look at us, all together.
Like the early days of the pandemic.

25:32.449 --> 25:33.659
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

25:33.659 --> 25:35.869
Hey, how's André?
Did he make it to Mariupol?

25:35.869 --> 25:37.371
I'm just waiting on word.

25:38.205 --> 25:40.791
The hospital bombing?
You have André Ford working on that?

25:40.791 --> 25:42.668
- Yeah.
- He's incredible.

25:43.377 --> 25:44.753
<i>YDA</i> is running something too?

25:44.753 --> 25:47.840
We were supposed to open with it tomorrow,
but at this point, who knows anything?

25:48.423 --> 25:50.050
Well, I can't wait to see your coverage.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.051
- Likewise.
- Okay.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.553
- Okay, let me know.
- Okay.

25:53.846 --> 25:58.225
Oh, my God. This party's never gonna end.

25:58.225 --> 26:00.686
Already burnt out
from your first upfronts?

26:00.686 --> 26:03.021
I've had to endure this for
the past 25 years.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.566
Although, at least in the '90s,
you could smoke,

26:05.566 --> 26:06.900
and cocaine couldn't kill you.

26:08.193 --> 26:10.988
I'm gonna need the details.
Maybe even pictures if you have them.

26:10.988 --> 26:14.449
Oh, yeah. Well, it's shocking, isn't it?
You know, I wasn't always this boring.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.201
Speaking of...

26:17.870 --> 26:20.038
should we go and explore the king's lair?

26:23.333 --> 26:24.668
I don't know. No.

26:24.668 --> 26:25.752
Come on.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.342
Hurry.

26:34.845 --> 26:38.849
Our analytics team estimates
that two billion hours of UBA content

26:38.849 --> 26:40.726
will be streamed by year-end.

26:41.602 --> 26:43.312
That's an impressive number.

26:43.312 --> 26:46.440
What's impressive
is how high your tolerance is.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.484
Especially for someone so petite.

26:50.485 --> 26:51.486
What?

26:51.486 --> 26:53.780
Yeah, Stella.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.116
- How have you been keeping up with us?
- Hey.

26:56.116 --> 26:58.368
- Covid. S--
- Let me s--

26:58.952 --> 27:00.621
No, it's fine. It's fine.

27:00.621 --> 27:02.331
- Let me get that.
- No, leave it.

27:03.749 --> 27:06.460
Actually,
maybe you can help us solve a debate.

27:06.460 --> 27:10.130
Do you think that there's gin in there,
or is it just water?

27:13.842 --> 27:15.928
You see,
I think you two have been working us.

27:18.847 --> 27:22.309
I got to get to the Hamptons.
So, I'd love to lock in a rate.

27:23.185 --> 27:26.605
She licks up that drink, and I'll close
at 150k per prime-time spot.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.653
Guys, leave her out of this.

27:33.445 --> 27:34.446
I'm serious.

27:35.322 --> 27:37.658
You buy something for me,
I buy something for you.

27:40.244 --> 27:42.287
Don't lowball me, Zach.

27:43.163 --> 27:47.084
200k per spot, best and final.

27:54.508 --> 27:55.509
Okay.

27:56.260 --> 28:00.597
$20,000 tip and everybody wins.

28:13.986 --> 28:17.155
Run my card now, if you want.
I promise I'm good for it.

28:39.094 --> 28:40.512
Attagirl.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.239
We have a deal.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.824
You are an animal.

29:02.159 --> 29:03.785
I can't take him anywhere.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.704
That's a joke. She'll be fine.

29:07.581 --> 29:08.707
I think we're done here.

30:17.359 --> 30:19.236
Oh, Chris, hello. You having a good time?

30:19.236 --> 30:23.031
Yeah, just getting myself together.
Lots more suits to take selfies with.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.241
Well, thank you for that.

30:24.241 --> 30:29.371
It always helps for them to get
to see the stars up close, you know?

30:29.371 --> 30:33.667
Speaking of which, congrats,
Mr. New Board Chairman.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.210
Thank you.

30:35.210 --> 30:38.463
Do you know, we haven't actually had
a chance to connect since

30:38.463 --> 30:40.132
Cybil's departure, have we?

30:40.132 --> 30:45.137
But I want you to know that it's
a whole new world at UBA.

30:45.137 --> 30:46.805
Right. I keep hearing that.

30:46.805 --> 30:51.435
Well, it's very important to us
that our ad partners hear that too.

30:53.187 --> 30:56.982
Well, so with all this money that we're
pulling in this week for the network,

30:56.982 --> 30:58.275
where's it going?

31:01.278 --> 31:02.654
What do you mean?

31:02.654 --> 31:05.490
Is any of it being used to address
the pay equity issue?

31:06.325 --> 31:10.037
Have your lawyers not seen our
new contract proposal for your services?

31:10.037 --> 31:12.497
- Yeah. Marcus is still looking that over.
- Well--

31:12.497 --> 31:15.042
But I'm talking about people
who don't have lawyers.

31:16.168 --> 31:20.214
Like Layla, my producer. Julia,
our stage manager. People like them.

31:20.214 --> 31:25.427
Well, I can assure you,
it is an absolute priority for us

31:25.427 --> 31:27.763
to address that issue as an institution.

31:27.763 --> 31:31.475
That is what Cybil said. Like verbatim.

31:32.267 --> 31:33.268
Right.

31:35.145 --> 31:39.149
Since Jemima-gate,
I gained 200,000 followers.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.527
Maybe I should ask them
what they think about this.

31:42.110 --> 31:43.987
TV loves a focus group, right?

31:44.780 --> 31:46.073
Right.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.282
I'll tell you what...

31:47.824 --> 31:51.620
it's a board meeting this week,
and I'm going to raise this issue.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.082
- All right? Okay.
- Thanks.

31:55.082 --> 31:56.166
Thank you.

32:06.885 --> 32:08.887
So, when you say you were kidnapped,

32:08.887 --> 32:11.557
do you mean
like you were kidnapped-kidnapped?

32:11.557 --> 32:13.058
Yeah, well, sort of.

32:14.017 --> 32:18.230
My stepfather pulled me out of 9th grade

32:18.230 --> 32:20.858
and put me in one of
those wilderness reform camps

32:20.858 --> 32:23.485
where I was literally stuck in
a tent by myself for a month.

32:23.485 --> 32:24.945
Oh, my God.

32:24.945 --> 32:27.739
I thought you were gonna say guns
and cartel, not child abuse.

32:29.074 --> 32:30.534
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

32:31.243 --> 32:33.620
Once I kinda figured out that no one
was really coming for me,

32:33.620 --> 32:36.665
I kinda got into it.

32:37.332 --> 32:40.919
No light pollution, no people,
being outside. Come on.

32:40.919 --> 32:43.130
Wow. That sounds divine.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.424
I would've loved that during the pandemic.

32:46.216 --> 32:47.217
Yeah. How about that?

32:47.217 --> 32:49.928
What was it like having Covid
with a camera in your face?

32:50.888 --> 32:51.930
You watched that, huh?

32:52.931 --> 32:56.268
Yeah. Yes, I did.
Me and the rest of America.

33:03.567 --> 33:04.568
What?

33:04.568 --> 33:06.653
Marks, I wanna make a deal with you.

33:07.404 --> 33:11.408
If I win this game, you reengage with UBA.

33:11.408 --> 33:12.993
Well, what happens if I win?

33:13.994 --> 33:15.704
You're not gonna win, but--

33:15.704 --> 33:16.997
Really?

33:18.165 --> 33:19.875
Okay.
Well, can you explain something to me?

33:19.875 --> 33:22.836
I don't understand why you
are fighting so hard for this place.

33:22.836 --> 33:25.422
From where I stand, it looks like
you could do whatever you want.

33:25.422 --> 33:26.590
You could go wherever you want.

33:26.590 --> 33:29.051
You could write another book,
you could start your own shop.

33:29.051 --> 33:31.220
And yet, here you are in Coney Island,

33:31.220 --> 33:33.847
playing a pinball game
in order to save UBA.

33:33.847 --> 33:34.806
No, no, no.

33:36.850 --> 33:37.851
My turn.

33:44.191 --> 33:47.236
I don't know. Maybe I think
I owe them something, you know?

33:50.739 --> 33:51.990
Do you though?

33:54.076 --> 33:56.119
Well, yeah.
I'd like to finish what I started.

33:56.745 --> 34:00.207
We said we were gonna make a lot
of changes, and we are not there yet.

34:00.207 --> 34:03.293
And you could be a part of all of that.

34:04.962 --> 34:07.673
Well, I just beat your score.

34:11.552 --> 34:15.179
Listen. Let's just enjoy the day, okay?

34:18.641 --> 34:19.518
Okay.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.358
I think this might be the primary suite.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.069
- Do you think so?
- Well...

34:29.069 --> 34:30.696
No pictures or anything.

34:33.282 --> 34:35.242
Lots of character.

34:38.495 --> 34:39.830
You seem better.

34:39.830 --> 34:41.581
I am, yeah.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.627
When you came to UBA the other day,
I was--

34:46.920 --> 34:49.130
- I lost it.
- That was brutal.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.841
Yeah.

34:52.509 --> 34:55.219
I wanted to ask,
that video never surfaced.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.182
And God knows those hackers
posted everything else.

34:58.182 --> 35:01.894
Yeah. I think Cory paid them to bury it.

35:02.519 --> 35:06.148
Our cyber guys connected with the hacker
or hackers.

35:06.732 --> 35:07.733
I don't really know.

35:09.735 --> 35:12.654
Well, that was nice of him.

35:13.947 --> 35:14.948
Yeah.

35:16.408 --> 35:17.743
I'm reading that too.

35:23.123 --> 35:27.169
Extra, extra firm.
Not a lot of sex happening here.

35:28.587 --> 35:30.547
I think that's his bed from the hotel.

35:31.256 --> 35:32.216
What?

35:33.217 --> 35:36.178
Yeah. I had that bed.
But different room, obviously.

35:36.762 --> 35:39.389
Cory bought his bed from the Archer Gray?

35:40.933 --> 35:45.229
I think Mr. Ellison misses having you
just down the hall from him.

35:47.481 --> 35:48.398
Laura.

35:50.901 --> 35:52.402
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

35:52.402 --> 35:55.864
I just don't know why you would
say something like that.

35:55.864 --> 35:57.658
Bradley, I meant nothing by it.

36:01.245 --> 36:03.163
I think we should go back downstairs.

36:03.664 --> 36:05.457
I don't want people
wondering where we are.

36:07.417 --> 36:08.418
Okay.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.567
I need a drink.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.235
Oh, my God. Chris Hunter.

36:33.235 --> 36:35.153
Okay. Hey, hey. Can I get your autograph?
Can I get a selfie?

36:35.153 --> 36:36.613
- I won't post it, I promise.
- Who? Me?

36:36.613 --> 36:38.448
The Rosa Parks of Legacy Media.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.826
Oh, please. You're in the back of the bus,

36:40.826 --> 36:43.912
then I'm the illegal alien cleaning
the office at night. Please.

36:43.912 --> 36:45.706
A tequila? Yeah? Okay.

36:45.706 --> 36:47.541
- Two shots of tequila, please, friend.
- Coming right up.

36:47.541 --> 36:49.459
<i>Para tokenización,</i> right here.

36:49.459 --> 36:50.544
Come on.

36:52.462 --> 36:55.132
I just grilled Leonard about how slow
the company's moving

36:55.132 --> 36:57.426
- on the pay equity issue.
- That's probably 'cause UBA's broke.

36:58.343 --> 37:00.888
Yeah. I've never seen them
go all out like this, for reference.

37:00.888 --> 37:03.140
- Really?
- Yeah. But hey, that's not your problem.

37:03.140 --> 37:05.809
I mean, Leonard should be able
to walk and chew gum at the same time.

37:05.809 --> 37:07.311
I did kinda lightweight threaten him.

37:07.311 --> 37:10.772
The only thing these corporate
people understand is public pressure.

37:10.772 --> 37:12.232
The followers. Right, yeah.

37:12.733 --> 37:13.567
Careful with that.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.903
- You don't want the tail wagging the dog.
- What do you mean?

37:15.903 --> 37:17.279
- Your two shots.
- Thanks, bud.

37:17.279 --> 37:18.655
You know how social media can be.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.783
Before you know it, they're
a mob making you their poster child.

37:21.783 --> 37:26.580
Yeah, but I can mobilize them
and think for myself at the same time.

37:26.580 --> 37:27.748
I know, all right?

37:27.748 --> 37:29.750
Everybody does after your interview
with Cybil,

37:29.750 --> 37:31.084
but it's not about that, Chris.

37:31.084 --> 37:35.005
I just-- I don't wanna see you
get dragged into the culture wars, okay?

37:35.005 --> 37:37.341
And believe me.
I speak from experience here.

37:37.341 --> 37:38.759
No good deed goes unpunished.

37:40.135 --> 37:42.513
I guess we'll see. Won't we?

37:57.319 --> 37:59.071
...in another country.

38:00.739 --> 38:03.909
- Hey. I can barely hear you. Sorry.
- <i>Connection's shitty.</i>

38:03.909 --> 38:05.536
Might take a minute to upload
all of the footage.

38:05.536 --> 38:06.745
I'm working off a BGAN.

38:06.745 --> 38:09.915
- <i>Where are they evacuating the wounded?</i>
- A military hospital in Donetsk.

38:09.915 --> 38:11.959
Russians are back to shelling
the shit out of this place.

38:11.959 --> 38:14.211
- I'm gonna just stay put for the moment.
- Are you okay?

38:14.211 --> 38:15.796
It looks really bad.

38:15.796 --> 38:17.548
I'm below ground. I'm fine.

38:17.548 --> 38:19.591
As long as you can get
those pictures out there.

38:19.591 --> 38:21.718
Mia, the Russians.
It's not just a bombing.

38:21.718 --> 38:23.220
They're shooting civilians in the street.

38:23.220 --> 38:25.931
Jesus. Okay. Yeah. I hear you.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.016
If it's okay with you,

38:28.016 --> 38:30.769
then I was thinking that I would
run these photos tonight.

38:30.769 --> 38:33.272
<i>Just don't do anything
until I'm outta here, okay?</i>

38:34.565 --> 38:37.234
<i>I gotta go. This call's gonna
eat up too much bandwidth.</i>

38:37.234 --> 38:39.236
Okay. Let me know when you're safe.

38:39.236 --> 38:40.529
André?

38:49.663 --> 38:50.873
Oh, my God.

38:52.583 --> 38:54.209
Holy shit.

39:21.737 --> 39:22.821
Excuse me one second.

39:22.821 --> 39:23.906
Of course.

39:27.451 --> 39:32.372
There she is.
UBA's assassin in athleisure wear.

39:32.372 --> 39:34.541
You live in a fucking terrarium.

39:35.751 --> 39:37.503
Wow. Hey, yeah.

39:37.503 --> 39:40.339
I guess they really--
They put you through the wringer, huh?

39:41.131 --> 39:42.132
I don't wanna talk about it.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.221
Excuse me.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.681
Stella,

39:50.933 --> 39:53.185
you locked down the ad revenue,
which means we locked down the loan.

39:53.185 --> 39:57.064
Which means 22,000 employees
get to keep their jobs,

39:57.064 --> 40:00.984
their health insurance,
the roof over their heads.

40:01.902 --> 40:04.446
We just gotta sign the paperwork now.

40:05.531 --> 40:10.244
And UBA lives to fight another day.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.383
Who the fuck invited Fred?

40:29.096 --> 40:30.097
Excuse me.

40:46.989 --> 40:47.823
Okay.

40:47.823 --> 40:50.284
We are not leaving without
getting one of these.

40:50.284 --> 40:52.494
Little fried dough for the road?

40:52.494 --> 40:56.373
- Yes, that's right. Oh, my God. Smell it.
- Smell better than they taste.

40:56.373 --> 41:00.002
- Oh, my gosh. This is my hangover cure.
- What can I get you, darling?

41:00.002 --> 41:03.505
I would love a funnel cake with
whipped cream and strawberries, please.

41:03.505 --> 41:06.258
And I will do the Oreo Lovers.
Heart attack waiting to happen.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.219
I know who you are.

41:09.887 --> 41:11.221
Hi, nice to see you.

41:11.221 --> 41:12.389
You're the cocktease.

41:13.807 --> 41:16.643
- I'm sorry. What did you just say?
- She's a cocktease.

41:17.144 --> 41:20.189
Mitch Kessler kills himself,
and I still gotta watch her on the news.

41:20.189 --> 41:22.024
Wow, you're a real ignorant piece of shit.

41:22.024 --> 41:23.317
- You know that, guy?
- Let's just go.

41:23.317 --> 41:25.819
You're just pissed
'cause your girlfriend cries "rape."

41:25.819 --> 41:28.322
No. I'm pissed
because you're being a fucking prick.

41:28.322 --> 41:30.741
I think what you meant to say is,
"Thank you." And you should apologize.

41:30.741 --> 41:32.784
- You understand me? Fuck you!
- Stop it, please!

41:32.784 --> 41:33.952
- Kidding me?
- Fuck you.

41:33.952 --> 41:35.245
- Fuck you. Fuck me.
- Stop it.

41:35.245 --> 41:36.830
- Enough.
- What are you f-- crazy?

41:36.830 --> 41:38.582
- You have to listen to that shit?
- No. Thank you, but

41:38.582 --> 41:39.833
you just cannot engage.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.377
But doesn't that get to you though?
I mean, seriously.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.838
Some asshole like that can say
whatever the fuck he wants,

41:44.838 --> 41:46.840
and you just have
to sit there and take it?

41:46.840 --> 41:48.759
It gets to me all the time.

41:49.927 --> 41:51.512
But that guy, he's not mad at me.

41:52.221 --> 41:55.516
He's mad at Mitch
for not being who he said he was.

41:56.058 --> 41:59.228
And I'm the one still here, so yeah.

41:59.228 --> 42:01.146
Strangers take a lot of shit out on me.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.274
Whatever they can't say
to their girlfriends or their wives,

42:04.274 --> 42:05.609
I'm the punching bag.

42:06.860 --> 42:08.529
It's okay. It's part of the job.

42:14.243 --> 42:16.537
Come on, let's get outta here. Let's go.

42:23.794 --> 42:26.380
- Good to see you, Mark.
- Give my best to Genevieve.

42:26.380 --> 42:28.215
All right, Mark. See you later.

42:29.925 --> 42:31.802
Fred Micklen.

42:31.802 --> 42:33.637
Crashing upfronts parties.

42:34.179 --> 42:36.390
Retirement, right?
You got all that time on your hands.

42:36.390 --> 42:39.601
You probably get
pretty restless over there.

42:39.601 --> 42:42.479
You know,
I hear Zen gardens are very calming.

42:42.479 --> 42:47.860
Nothing like a little meditative raking to
soothe the restless, jobless soul.

42:48.735 --> 42:49.987
I missed you too, Cory.

42:50.696 --> 42:53.198
Hey, congrats on the house.
I know the previous owner.

42:54.116 --> 42:56.243
He's been trying to unload it for ages.

42:56.827 --> 42:57.911
Gee, thanks.

42:57.911 --> 43:01.915
Yeah. I probably shouldn't have,
but I decided to splurge.

43:01.915 --> 43:04.710
You have to celebrate the victories,
you know?

43:05.294 --> 43:06.753
I do.

43:06.753 --> 43:10.716
Though I hear Q1 revenue is down 23%.

43:11.717 --> 43:13.927
You're cutting back on programming
for UBA+,

43:13.927 --> 43:16.597
the incredible shrinking network.

43:16.597 --> 43:20.142
Fred, are you digging through my trash?
You're so obsessed with me.

43:20.142 --> 43:23.562
I told you a streamer was a fool's errand.

43:23.562 --> 43:26.982
You were late to the game,
and too many people wanted to play.

43:26.982 --> 43:30.319
We were late because you shot down
the idea at every fucking turn.

43:30.319 --> 43:33.488
So, thanks for that. Appreciate the help.
What are you doing at my house?

43:33.488 --> 43:35.574
I don't know.
I just love seeing you shake your tin cup

43:35.574 --> 43:36.909
for the spare nickel or two.

43:36.909 --> 43:39.661
I mean, since your little bromance
with Paul Marks didn't pan out.

43:39.661 --> 43:41.705
Does this look like
we are on the breadline?

43:42.247 --> 43:44.208
Breadline? Try debtor's prison.

43:46.001 --> 43:47.211
That loan you got today,

43:48.879 --> 43:53.133
Sloan asked me to keep an eye on it
since I know the lay of the land.

43:53.133 --> 43:54.218
Off the books, of course.

43:55.177 --> 44:00.390
Every major fiscal decision,
you're gonna be running by me.

44:02.559 --> 44:04.561
I'm your sugar daddy, Cory.

44:05.354 --> 44:07.689
You're gonna work for me. Again.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.653
Well, as your sugar baby,

44:12.653 --> 44:14.947
I'm looking forward
to the wining and dining.

44:14.947 --> 44:17.658
You'll be wearing golden handcuffs
when I fuck you.

44:18.825 --> 44:22.371
I'll send the papers to your office.
Hey, just wanted to give you a heads-up.

44:31.338 --> 44:32.339
How are you doing?

44:39.555 --> 44:42.182
Gayle says you wanna bump the Macron piece
for Mariupol.

44:42.933 --> 44:43.934
Hospital bombing.

44:45.352 --> 44:48.230
- Oh, my God. Are these verified?
- Yeah, they are.

44:48.230 --> 44:51.191
<i>YDA</i>'s all over this story,
but these are exclusive to us.

44:51.191 --> 44:54.403
- Great. So, let's run it tonight.
- Yeah, I told the photojournalist

44:54.403 --> 44:56.822
that I'd wait until I got confirmation
that he was out of harm's way.

44:56.822 --> 44:58.323
I haven't heard from him yet.

44:59.366 --> 45:02.202
This is the guy who got us those photos
of Putin's inner circle, right?

45:02.202 --> 45:04.496
- Yeah. André Ford.
- He's a freelancer.

45:05.247 --> 45:07.916
So, he's assumed liability.
He's aware of the risk.

45:07.916 --> 45:10.794
The press has been targeted. These photos
could land him on a kill list.

45:12.379 --> 45:13.463
I'm confused.

45:13.463 --> 45:16.049
You wanna hold a breaking exclusive?

45:16.049 --> 45:18.302
Stella, a life is on the line.

45:18.302 --> 45:19.386
That's a job.

45:19.386 --> 45:21.972
He's doing it. So, you can do yours.

45:21.972 --> 45:23.557
These images are important.

45:23.557 --> 45:26.268
They can drive the conversation
about increasing aid to Ukraine.

45:27.394 --> 45:29.438
But it's your call, of course.

45:31.773 --> 45:32.858
Whatever you think.

45:34.318 --> 45:35.819
I'm gonna wait a little longer.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.992
- Here.
- Hey, thanks.

45:46.330 --> 45:48.457
I'm sorry
if I made you uncomfortable earlier.

45:49.583 --> 45:50.918
Oh, no. It's okay.

45:52.044 --> 45:53.295
It's just confusing.

45:53.879 --> 45:54.880
What is?

45:56.798 --> 45:57.799
Thinking about us.

45:58.967 --> 46:00.093
Being with you.

46:01.970 --> 46:03.972
I'm not asking for any of that.

46:05.140 --> 46:06.308
It's just good to see you.

46:07.017 --> 46:08.018
I know.

46:08.602 --> 46:12.397
And part of me just wants to run away
with you

46:13.148 --> 46:15.108
and leave all of this behind.

46:16.401 --> 46:21.281
And part of me remembers
how miserable I was.

46:21.865 --> 46:24.993
But it's not the same. We're not the same.

46:26.078 --> 46:28.121
And you were going through so much.

46:31.124 --> 46:34.127
I wanted to be close to you.

46:41.301 --> 46:44.471
- Not seeing many ad buyers up here.
- I was just taking a little breather.

46:44.471 --> 46:45.931
Well, you're still on the clock.

46:46.598 --> 46:49.810
Okay, boss.
I didn't realize I'd lost my time card.

46:49.810 --> 46:52.646
You are being asked
to drink free champagne

46:52.646 --> 46:55.274
and talk to the nice people
whose ads pay for your salary.

46:55.274 --> 46:57.860
- It's really not that hard.
- Okay.

46:57.860 --> 47:00.153
Is there somebody
you would like me to meet?

47:00.654 --> 47:02.364
You know what? I should head out.

47:02.364 --> 47:05.367
- You have a lovely home, Cory.
- Thanks for dropping by, Laura.

47:10.706 --> 47:13.750
I'm really not asking that much
considering everything I've done for you.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.391
Fuck.

47:39.276 --> 47:40.736
Hey, it's Mia.

47:42.946 --> 47:45.908
I know it can take a while
to get to some place safe.

47:47.701 --> 47:49.453
God knows the Russians
are doing everything they can

47:49.453 --> 47:50.954
to knock out communications.

47:53.498 --> 47:54.499
Anyway...

47:56.627 --> 47:59.129
I just wanted to tell you
I hope you made it out of there.

48:02.382 --> 48:03.842
Call me as soon as you can.

48:20.651 --> 48:21.818
Hey, Gayle, it's Mia.

48:22.361 --> 48:25.572
Yeah, I know everyone is standing by.

48:27.866 --> 48:29.076
Run the photos.

48:31.495 --> 48:33.080
No, I don't need to see the copy.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.085
Okay, thank you, Gayle.

48:40.587 --> 48:41.588
Good night.

48:57.521 --> 48:58.897
Hey, you wanted to see me?

48:58.897 --> 48:59.940
Yeah,

48:59.940 --> 49:04.278
you know, the beautiful thing about the
human body is its capacity for survival.

49:04.278 --> 49:07.322
You can lose 40% of your blood.
Still keep going.

49:07.322 --> 49:09.575
After that you go into hypovolemic shock--

49:09.575 --> 49:11.618
Wait, hold on. What are you talking about?

49:11.618 --> 49:14.079
Didn't we just score, like, $8 billion?

49:16.081 --> 49:17.207
So, Fred,

49:17.207 --> 49:22.045
he dropped by to let me know that
he is working for Sloan,

49:22.045 --> 49:24.173
consulting off the books.

49:24.173 --> 49:26.216
And we take that loan, he owns us.

49:26.216 --> 49:29.469
And then the <i>Times</i>, and then
the tabloids and Maggie fucking Brener,

49:29.469 --> 49:31.513
they'll find out that Fred is still
creeping around UBA.

49:31.513 --> 49:33.640
And then they'll own us,
and we'll be done, and--

49:33.640 --> 49:35.350
So, you know.

49:35.350 --> 49:36.435
Okay.

49:38.604 --> 49:43.859
Maybe next time do some due diligence
before you make me eat shit with Ellipse.

49:43.859 --> 49:45.194
Sorry.

49:45.194 --> 49:47.404
Yeah. I should've known.

49:47.404 --> 49:50.741
- They wanted me by the throat.
- Oh, my God. I don't fucking believe this.

49:52.159 --> 49:54.077
Sorry, Stella. And hey.

49:56.663 --> 49:57.873
I'm gonna find the funding.

50:01.084 --> 50:02.085
Good luck with that.

50:43.460 --> 50:44.962
Who the hell is that?

50:45.504 --> 50:47.631
Ron Perlman lives next door.

50:48.715 --> 50:50.592
He abuses his air rights.

51:19.204 --> 51:21.373
Un-fucking-believable.

51:22.624 --> 51:25.377
Alex Levy brought home the kill.
