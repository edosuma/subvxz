01:40.134 --> 01:43.238
First position. Second position.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.092
Third position.

01:45.172 --> 01:49.241
Fourth position, open.
Fourth position, closed.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.965
Very good, Dick.

01:51.045 --> 01:54.502
You'll be doing multiple
double tours in no time.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.238
Gosh, Bruce, kids don't ballet dance.

01:57.318 --> 02:01.175
I mean, I feel ridiculous in these tights.

02:01.255 --> 02:05.913
The discipline of ballet promotes
balance, flexibility and strength,

02:05.993 --> 02:10.317
all useful things in our
never-ending fight against crime.

02:10.396 --> 02:13.020
Gee willikers,
I never thought of it that way.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.456
Now, that's enough practice for one night.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.258
Gotham Palace is on,

02:17.338 --> 02:21.595
and even crime fighters need
mindless entertainment sometimes.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.142
Gosh, yes! It's my favorite show.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.837
Welcome to everyone's
favorite variety show,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.939
the Gotham Palace.

02:32.019 --> 02:37.611
And here's your host, that international
starlet of stage and screen,

02:37.691 --> 02:41.015
Miranda Monroe.

02:41.095 --> 02:44.518
Thank you. Thank you.

02:44.598 --> 02:48.556
On tonight's show, we have
those singing sensations,

02:48.636 --> 02:51.025
the mop tops with the mostest,

02:51.105 --> 02:53.972
Hector and the Ho Daddies.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.584
Those aren't the Ho Daddies.

03:16.664 --> 03:20.721
No, it's that mocking mountebank
of malice, the Joker.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.224
Oh, sorry, kitties,

03:23.304 --> 03:27.428
but the Ho Daddies have decided
to play a smaller venue,

03:27.508 --> 03:30.731
the broom closet backstage.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.936
Bruce, look!

03:36.016 --> 03:38.706
It's that black-hearted bearer
of a billion bumbershoots, the Penguin.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.375
Careful, you pre-pubescent pipsqueaks,

03:41.455 --> 03:44.477
or I'll give you a taste
of my Penguin umbrella.

03:45.026 --> 03:48.082
And the prince of perverted
puzzles, the Riddler.

03:48.162 --> 03:52.186
Riddle me this. What kind
of band doesn't play music?

03:52.266 --> 03:55.722
Answer. A band of thieves.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.072
And of course,
that dominatrix of deviltry...

04:01.175 --> 04:03.964
Catwoman needs no introduction.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.866
Holy unholy alliance.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.535
Our greatest foes have reunited.

04:08.615 --> 04:11.616
Quick, gang, we have to hold
these creepy crooks for the cops.

04:24.998 --> 04:28.956
I do love a captive audience,
but we must be going.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.325
Let us away, let us away.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.493
It's the Bat-Signal, sir.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.821
Yes, Alfred, no doubt the Commissioner
is already calling.

05:02.672 --> 05:03.991
Mercy alive.

05:04.071 --> 05:08.006
Why, you'd think you were Batman
and Robin, rushing out like that.

05:09.943 --> 05:13.100
We were just going fishing, Aunt Harriet.

05:13.870 --> 05:16.804
At this hour? Land's sake!

05:16.884 --> 05:19.139
You two sure do fish a lot.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.375
We find it's a great way to relax

05:21.455 --> 05:24.812
from the pressures of being a millionaire
playboy and his teenage ward.

05:24.892 --> 05:29.483
Indeed. Now, if you'll
excuse us, Aunt Harriet.

05:29.563 --> 05:34.388
Can you believe the lengths
those two go to keep their little secret?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.957
- Secret, ma'am?
- Why, Alfred!

05:37.037 --> 05:39.193
You really don't see it?

05:39.273 --> 05:40.494
No, I do not.

05:40.574 --> 05:44.365
Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe
the upstairs doorknobs need polishing.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.844
Good day, madam.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.508
No need to explain, Commissioner.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.543
We saw the whole sordid affair.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.046
Those criminals
will be brought to justice,

05:59.126 --> 06:01.915
or I'll know the reason why.
We're on our way.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.417
Hurry, Caped Crusader.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.319
Whoever you may be
under that cowl of yours,

06:05.399 --> 06:08.366
you paladin of virtue,
you're our only hope.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.673
To the Batcave.

07:32.753 --> 07:36.810
"Poor people have it, rich people
need it, if you eat it, you die."

07:36.890 --> 07:38.745
- What is it?
- Nothing.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.248
I can't come up
with anything either, Batman.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.618
No, Chief, the answer is "nothing."

07:44.698 --> 07:49.089
How can "nothing" be a clue,
when it's not even a thing?

07:49.169 --> 07:53.093
In this case, "nothing"
is certainly something.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.995
- Robin?
- Let's see...

07:55.075 --> 07:58.165
Zero. Zilch. Goose egg.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.533
Precisely.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.669
Farmer Jones delivered a shipment
of his prizewinning goose eggs

08:02.749 --> 08:05.339
to the local market just last week.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.441
They're after eggs?

08:07.521 --> 08:11.345
It's not what was delivered,
Commissioner, rather when.

08:11.425 --> 08:15.115
Last Tuesday, which was also
the night of the total lunar eclipse.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.384
You see, it's really quite simple.

08:17.464 --> 08:21.855
The Atomic Energy Laboratory, headed
by our old friend, Professor Nichols,

08:21.935 --> 08:27.561
just opened a new wing dedicated
to the science of total lunar eclipses.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.631
And I'll bet my cowl
the laboratory is where

08:30.711 --> 08:33.866
those felonious fiends
are going to strike next.

08:33.947 --> 08:37.538
Of course, how could I not see it myself?

08:37.618 --> 08:41.186
Come on, Robin,
there's a bad moon on the rise.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.688
To the Batmobile!

08:46.627 --> 08:48.815
What would we do
without him, Commissioner?

08:48.895 --> 08:51.796
I shudder to even consider it, O'Hara.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.494
Not so fast, old chum.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.195
But we're in a hurry, Batman.

09:02.275 --> 09:06.333
Jaywalking is extremely hazardous,
especially at night.

09:06.413 --> 09:09.369
As duly deputized officers of the law,

09:09.449 --> 09:11.772
it is imperative we follow the rules.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.574
Gosh, yes, you're right, Batman.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.677
No one's above the law,
even when you're trying to enforce it.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.257
Quickly, Robin, to the crosswalk!

09:30.137 --> 09:33.226
The Replica Ray has
the ability to scan an object

09:33.306 --> 09:35.696
and create an identical version.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.242
Observe.

09:45.519 --> 09:49.776
As you might imagine,
the applications are endless.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.645
Does anyone have any questions?

09:51.725 --> 09:54.448
I do...

09:56.563 --> 09:57.918
Riddle me this.

09:57.998 --> 10:01.754
What is black and blue and red all over?

10:02.836 --> 10:05.993
Answer.
You, if you don't hand over the ray.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.661
You heard him, knave.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.896
Never!

10:09.976 --> 10:13.133
It's too important to give to filthy
criminal types such as yourselves.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.136
Oh! You dare defy us?

10:16.216 --> 10:20.139
You must be insane. And here's the proof!

10:30.397 --> 10:33.331
Why, you're practically certifiable.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.163
Scientists, head for cover.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.366
The only things these fiends
will be multiplying with that device

10:46.446 --> 10:48.702
is their prison sentences.

10:48.782 --> 10:52.606
Great quivering jellyfish,
the dynamic dunderheads!

10:52.686 --> 10:55.353
Into the fray, my fitness finks.

12:01.788 --> 12:07.547
Oh, Batman, give up this life
of excessive do-gooding and join us.

12:07.627 --> 12:10.762
A man of your skills
could be quite useful to me.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.397
Us...

12:13.767 --> 12:16.523
When heck freezes over,
you shameless Bathsheba.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.593
Let the grownups talk, boy bird-brain.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.430
Tag! You're it!

12:24.010 --> 12:27.200
We could have a lot of fun.
What do you say?

12:27.280 --> 12:30.203
I say, renounce your evil ways, Catwoman.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.618
Cease this infernal flirting.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.314
Three Catwomen!

12:41.394 --> 12:44.417
- Is that so bad?
- Of course it is!

12:44.497 --> 12:46.286
Now he has to pick just one.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.623
Perhaps not!

12:49.703 --> 12:52.259
Batman, they're getting away
with the Replica Ray.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.940
Ironic, since I'm seeing triple.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.645
They won't get far. To the Batmobile.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.044
Holy crumbling infrastructure!

14:09.616 --> 14:12.684
Robin, time to use our trusty Batzooka!

14:35.075 --> 14:37.041
Holy trench warfare!

14:45.485 --> 14:46.718
Tin foil?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.345
What does it mean, Batman?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.180
We were foiled, Robin.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.950
A taunt from our arrogant adversaries.

14:57.030 --> 15:01.733
But in their hubris, they may have left
a clue to the location of their lair.

15:04.671 --> 15:09.696
This machine contains the information
of two sets of encyclopedias.

15:09.776 --> 15:13.266
It'll be able to collect
and analyze data in mere seconds.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.803
Holy Einstein!
That's a lot of brain power.

15:19.285 --> 15:22.609
Amorphous semi-crystalline layers.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.044
Starch.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.713
More precisely, gravy.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.048
So what does it mean?

15:28.128 --> 15:31.751
Take all the clues together,
the foil, the gravy...

15:31.831 --> 15:33.286
Holy Salisbury steak!

15:33.366 --> 15:35.722
- That could only mean...
- Right again, old chum.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.925
The Fitzsimmons TV dinner factory
is where they're holed up.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.104
Let's go.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.440
I say!

15:53.520 --> 15:56.676
It is patently preposterous,
you pretentious poser!

15:56.756 --> 16:02.983
With this ray we can multiply money,
diamonds, females... Heh...

16:03.063 --> 16:07.187
I wouldn't expect you to understand,
you boorish bird.

16:07.267 --> 16:11.124
Only those who view crime
as an art form have true vision.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.692
Right, Joker?

16:12.772 --> 16:16.329
Oh, don't drag me into your
tedious tete-a-tete.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.833
As long as the punch line
is funny, I don't care.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.868
Enough caterwauling.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.939
None of it will matter if Batman
stops us, like he always does.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.507
Oh, dear me.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.643
Someone's being a touchy tatty.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.513
Ooh! Why the bad humor, Catwoman?

16:33.593 --> 16:38.718
I'm just saying we need Batmam
on our side if we want to truly thrive.

16:38.798 --> 16:44.024
My greatest joy as a super crook
is confounding that cowled clod!

16:44.104 --> 16:46.493
Still, you do have a point.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.462
But how do you turn a bat into a rat?

16:49.542 --> 16:51.364
I call it Batnip.

16:51.444 --> 16:56.969
One scratch, and mass muscles
will be mine to manipulate.

16:57.649 --> 17:01.541
That's been tried before,
by better crooks than you.

17:02.621 --> 17:06.212
Watch your tongue.
No one challenges the princess of plunder.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.314
It will work, I guarantee it.

17:08.394 --> 17:09.582
Now, quickly...

17:09.662 --> 17:12.864
No doubt he's already on his way.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.855
Feisty feline.

17:15.935 --> 17:19.191
Soon you'll be a diva declawed.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.705
With those four felons
possibly hiding in wait for us,

17:32.785 --> 17:35.052
we don't dare use the front door.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.255
Really feeling the burn
in the legs, Batman.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.891
That ballet practice took a lot out of me.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.194
Thus supporting my suspicion

17:54.274 --> 17:58.064
you've been focusing too much on your
upper-body strength during workouts.

17:58.144 --> 18:01.412
Gee whiz, I have been spending
a lot of time on my biceps.

18:08.555 --> 18:13.313
A frozen TV dinner factory.

18:13.393 --> 18:18.651
Appropriate, as you'll all soon be put
on ice in Gotham State Penitentiary.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.086
Show yourselves.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.960
Oh, stop me if you've heard
this one, Batman.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.096
Why don't eggs tell jokes?

18:30.176 --> 18:33.132
Because they crack each other up.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.216
You need new material.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.952
Fools! Get them.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.536
One last time, Catwoman,

19:09.616 --> 19:12.872
I implore you to turn yourself
in without a fight.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.708
You will be gentle with me, Batman?

19:15.788 --> 19:20.124
You have my assurance
I will handle you... personally.

19:21.694 --> 19:25.185
That sounds divine.
I'd like that very much.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.519
Shall we go, then?

19:26.599 --> 19:29.355
But first, may I fix my hair?

19:29.435 --> 19:31.791
I always like to look good for the judge.

19:31.871 --> 19:36.396
A woman as beauteous as yourself
should be allowed to look her best.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.943
You've earned that much
for doing the right thing.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.872
Holy noxious gas!

19:48.821 --> 19:51.188
Goodnight, sweet prince.

19:55.795 --> 19:59.697
Rise and shine, my winged warriors.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.468
It doesn't have to be this way, Batman.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.893
You're right.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.062
It's not too late to renounce
your evil ways, Catwoman.

20:09.142 --> 20:13.666
You are the one who will renounce
his ways, my dutiful do-gooder.

20:13.746 --> 20:17.070
Granted, you've been known
to cloud the minds of men,

20:17.150 --> 20:20.607
but I live by a set
of immalleable principles.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.176
Oh, that's where this comes in.

20:23.256 --> 20:29.427
After a dose, I think you'll find
your principles less rigid.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.761
What did you do to him,
you sinful succubus?

20:41.841 --> 20:43.074
Observe.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.676
Kiss me, Batman.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.245
I...

20:50.216 --> 20:53.306
- I...
- Batman, no! Don't do it.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.642
- Will...
- Don't do it.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.088
Will...

20:59.525 --> 21:00.725
Not!

21:02.028 --> 21:04.250
Don't worry, old chum.

21:04.330 --> 21:08.599
My moral fiber is stronger than any
substance this she-devil might concoct.

21:10.336 --> 21:13.226
Oh, well, no use crying over spilled milk.

21:13.306 --> 21:16.929
Ah! I told you it wouldn't work.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.665
Never mind, Pengi...

21:18.745 --> 21:21.301
Magic potions may not affect Batman,

21:21.381 --> 21:25.437
but I'm sure good old-fashioned fire does.

21:38.398 --> 21:44.290
Our most hated foes are about
to become a human TV dinner.

21:44.370 --> 21:47.826
Huzzah! Huzzah!

21:49.075 --> 21:54.467
Fiends! I swear by all that is just,
you will rue this day.

21:54.547 --> 21:58.437
The only roux here is in the gravy.

21:59.585 --> 22:03.442
Come, my capricious cronies
in criminality.

22:09.128 --> 22:13.186
It's starting to heat up, Batman.
But, we do smell delicious.

22:13.266 --> 22:16.000
The smell of death, Robin, I'm afraid.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.160
Guess this is our last meal, Batman.

22:21.240 --> 22:25.464
Then this is one time I would
advocate starting with dessert.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.302
I suppose it doesn't matter
if we ruin our appetites now.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.683
No, Robin. The dessert is a lemon tart.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.541
Holy citric enzymes!

22:35.621 --> 22:37.143
Lemons are acidic.

22:37.223 --> 22:38.811
Correct, Robin.

22:38.891 --> 22:42.548
Now if I can just cover my ropes
with this lemon filling,

22:42.628 --> 22:46.564
the acidic content might be
enough to weaken my bonds.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.662
Hurry, Batman!

23:06.919 --> 23:10.042
Holy entree, Batman!
We were almost done for.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.111
Well done, to be precise.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.448
Though I find it quite distasteful
they got away.

23:15.528 --> 23:18.084
At least Catwoman's play
to turn you evil didn't work.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.052
True.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.755
Now we still have to uncover
what those malicious miscreants

23:22.835 --> 23:25.369
have planned for the Replica Ray.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.101
Can you believe it?

23:35.181 --> 23:39.071
Those Bolsheviks in Belgravia have
launched another manned space flight.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.240
Shameful indeed, Chief.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.476
It seems when it comes to the space race,

23:43.556 --> 23:46.712
we've fallen even further behind.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.749
Watching television while on the job?

23:49.829 --> 23:52.452
I certainly don't
condone that, Commissioner.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.554
Oh, uh, of course, Batman.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.122
So sorry. We were just...

23:56.202 --> 23:59.258
It's not me you need to apologize to.

23:59.338 --> 24:02.728
It's the law-abiding
taxpayers of Gotham City.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.398
You're quite right, Caped Crusader.

24:05.478 --> 24:08.634
Begorra! I've never been so ashamed.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.470
Enough sniveling, gentlemen.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.139
We're here on more pressing matters.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.808
The Joker and his crooked
cohorts got away.

24:15.888 --> 24:19.779
We're sure they're causing mayhem
to Gotham City. But where?

24:19.859 --> 24:23.015
Strangely enough, we haven't heard
a peep from them, Boy Wonder.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.650
Not a peep?

24:24.730 --> 24:26.630
How unlike those fiends.

24:34.273 --> 24:37.930
Harriet Cooper, you know this is Bruce's

24:38.010 --> 24:42.168
hallowed and forbidden
no woman's land. Oh!

24:42.248 --> 24:45.316
But I just know he's hiding something.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.519
A red phone.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.156
My, how unique.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.950
Mustn't touch, Aunt Harriet.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.454
The oil from your fingers
can ruin the finish.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.155
Bruce! I...

25:03.235 --> 25:05.024
- I was just...
- Leaving?

25:05.104 --> 25:07.593
Yes. Of course.

25:08.073 --> 25:11.998
Land's sakes! How did I end up in here?

25:12.078 --> 25:16.903
Wayne Manor is so big,
it's easy to get turned around.

25:19.385 --> 25:20.884
Toodle-oo boys!

25:22.555 --> 25:24.343
Gosh, that was close.

25:24.423 --> 25:26.746
Too close, I'm afraid.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.327
Alfred!

25:29.895 --> 25:31.031
Sir.

25:31.131 --> 25:34.720
Aunt Harriet almost uncovered
our most intimate of secrets,

25:34.800 --> 25:37.690
our true identities as crime fighters.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.660
It's your job to keep her
away from this study.

25:40.740 --> 25:44.063
Deepest apologies, sir.
It won't happen again.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.598
No, it won't.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.667
You're dismissed.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.402
For the night?

25:49.482 --> 25:50.981
Forever.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.885
Bruce, surely you don't mean it.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.247
It's quite all right, Master Dick.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.450
Master Bruce, it has been
an honor to serve you.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.063
Goodbye, Alfred.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.734
I'm sure you'll continue
to make me proud, Master Dick.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.570
Goodbye.

26:19.145 --> 26:22.101
Gosh, Bruce, he's been
with you since you were a boy.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.070
It wasn't that big of a deal.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.405
An entire city depends on us.

26:26.485 --> 26:29.809
Clearly, Alfred had gotten
too comfortable here.

26:29.889 --> 26:33.446
I suspect a change
would be best for both of us.

26:33.526 --> 26:36.248
Now, enough sentimentality.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.618
There's much work yet to do.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.431
To the Batcave!

26:45.137 --> 26:46.437
Now!

28:01.714 --> 28:04.670
Holy dragnet!
We've looked everywhere, Batman.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.539
Downtown, uptown, in the bay...

28:06.619 --> 28:08.574
It doesn't make any sense.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.309
Maybe they've given up.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.912
I mean it's either that
or they're not on this planet.

28:12.992 --> 28:16.248
Great Scott, that's it, Robin!
Lex parsimoniae.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.984
Latin for "law of parsimony"?

28:19.064 --> 28:22.888
Good job. Your grasp of the dead
languages has improved.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.702
No language can be dead
if it lives in your heart.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.094
Quite true.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.862
Law of parsimony.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.364
Also known as Occam's Razor.

28:32.444 --> 28:37.169
When you have two competing theories,
the simplest one tends to be true.

28:37.249 --> 28:40.206
So I ask you, did the most depraved,

28:40.286 --> 28:43.609
evil, cold-hearted individuals
throw in the towel?

28:43.689 --> 28:46.078
Or is it something simpler?

28:46.158 --> 28:51.083
We can't find them because
they're no longer on this planet.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.753
- Holy Trojan horse!
- Yes, Robin.

28:53.833 --> 28:57.757
I contend those thieves hitched
a ride on that Belgravian rocket

28:57.837 --> 29:00.204
that was just launched into space.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.401
Approaching Space Station, comrade.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.348
Prepare to dock.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.740
Oh, pardon me, boys,

29:14.820 --> 29:18.043
but could you direct me
to the powder room in this tin can?

29:18.123 --> 29:19.578
No?

29:19.658 --> 29:22.748
Then I'm afraid
you'll have to take a powder.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.677
Pengi?

29:31.971 --> 29:36.394
Sweet dreams, my comatose cosmonauts.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.646
To the Batrocket!

29:59.064 --> 30:00.753
Gosh, Batman.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.956
I never thought we'd need
the Batrocket on one of our cases.

30:04.036 --> 30:09.461
An intergalactic spaceship is just
another tool in a crime fighter's arsenal.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.430
Now, Robin,

30:11.510 --> 30:15.467
space travel is the most dangerous
endeavor man has ever embarked upon.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.770
I need to know if you
have the right stuff.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.840
If brave men weren't
willing to take bold risks,

30:20.920 --> 30:24.543
we wouldn't be able to move
forward as a society.

30:24.623 --> 30:28.047
Then we take a bold risk now,
for Gotham City.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.216
Initiate Bat-countdown.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.518
T-minus 10 seconds.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.997
Fire booster rockets.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.268
Adjust Bat-radar dish.

30:42.107 --> 30:43.340
Open launch doors.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.868
T-minus five...

30:48.948 --> 30:50.236
Four... Three...

30:50.316 --> 30:51.403
Two... One!

30:51.483 --> 30:53.517
Ignition. Ready to move out.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.997
How delicious!

31:18.077 --> 31:21.666
I've always wanted to rule from the stars.

31:24.316 --> 31:29.074
This will go down in history
as the greatest caper in the universe.

31:30.790 --> 31:34.880
And when we three are done,
there'll be no one to stop us.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.251
There are four cats in this litter,
you pudgy peon!

31:39.331 --> 31:43.188
Yes. But one runt which
must get tossed out.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.224
Treachery! But why?

31:45.304 --> 31:47.726
You're soft on Batman.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.962
And we all know how fickle cats can be.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.197
Who's to say you won't turn on us...

31:52.277 --> 31:53.410
For him?

31:55.848 --> 31:58.103
Ha! The cat's got her own tongue.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.707
Ah, well...

32:01.687 --> 32:05.077
Just think of it as one
small step for mankind,

32:05.157 --> 32:09.092
and you'll be able to swim back to Earth.

32:11.296 --> 32:14.420
Oh... Get her boys!

32:29.348 --> 32:32.571
That's some space station, Batman.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.808
A top secret joint venture
between our government

32:35.888 --> 32:38.010
and the government of Belgravia.

32:38.090 --> 32:41.647
Ultimately our two countries couldn't
figure out a way to work together

32:41.727 --> 32:42.948
and it was abandoned.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.984
- What a waste!
- Yes.

32:45.064 --> 32:48.787
From up here it becomes clear
that we're all one people.

32:48.867 --> 32:54.137
I hate to the core of my being
when diplomacy is destroyed by myopic pride.

33:00.946 --> 33:02.946
Engage Bat-gravity boots.

33:07.286 --> 33:10.776
Holy helium!
Bat-climbs would be much easier this way.

33:10.856 --> 33:13.779
Easier, but eventually
your muscles would atrophy,

33:13.859 --> 33:16.115
your bones would lose density.

33:16.195 --> 33:20.352
You see, Robin, there are consequences
to doing things the easy way,

33:20.432 --> 33:26.358
something villains rarely take into
consideration when choosing a life of crime.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.771
Golly. Right again, Batman

33:31.376 --> 33:35.134
The only thing a cat hates more
than water is the vacuum of space.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.037
Then I hope you can hold
your breath, pussycat.

33:38.117 --> 33:41.207
Looks like the cat will go splat.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.643
And now, it's time to put you
out for the night.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.224
Off you go!

34:11.851 --> 34:16.074
May I assume your twisted teammates
turned the tables on you?

34:16.155 --> 34:19.777
Where's your chivalry, Batman?

34:19.858 --> 34:25.250
It's impolite to rub your masculine
superiority in a woman's face.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.554
Serves you right, you depraved creature.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.621
Are you sure we can't kill him?

34:30.702 --> 34:34.025
When you're older, you'll come
to appreciate the pungent allure

34:34.106 --> 34:36.929
of the feminine mystique, old chum.

34:37.009 --> 34:40.911
But now it's time to dish out
some well-deserved fisticuffs.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.108
Up with your flippers, you unholy three!

34:49.188 --> 34:53.255
And hope that I leave enough
of you to put behind prison bars.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.249
Curses! It's Batman.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.585
Ha, the cat came back.

34:59.665 --> 35:03.088
Oh! How did he find us this time?

35:03.168 --> 35:05.157
Why, you quizzical creep!

35:05.237 --> 35:08.827
It wasn't me! I resisted the urge.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.830
He's Batman, you moronic
muttonheads, that's how.

35:11.910 --> 35:17.169
Of course! You probably left a trail
of breadcrumbs for your little loverboy.

35:17.249 --> 35:22.174
No, Penguin. I deduced
where you were, but not why.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.810
Then riddle me this, Batman.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.479
How do you hold a party in space?

35:27.559 --> 35:30.616
Answer, you "plan-et."

35:30.696 --> 35:32.951
Only we want to make three.

35:33.031 --> 35:35.420
You diabolical devils!

35:35.500 --> 35:39.992
Yes, then there can be a Gotham City
for each of us to control

35:40.072 --> 35:43.595
without interference
from the caped clodpoles.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.498
Of all the world-creating arrogance!

35:46.578 --> 35:49.601
Don't worry, Batman, they'll
soon be where they belong.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.670
Behind prison bars.

35:51.750 --> 35:55.941
Actually, Robin, I'm thinking
of sending them out of the airlock.

35:56.021 --> 35:58.844
Yeah! Let's see how they like it.

35:58.924 --> 36:03.549
Ah! By the Marquess of Queensberry,
you have to follow the rules!

36:03.629 --> 36:04.950
Do I?

36:05.030 --> 36:07.319
Of course, Batman!

36:07.399 --> 36:11.490
As duly deputized officers, we are
honor-bound to follow the tenets of the law.

36:11.570 --> 36:15.527
Technically, we're outside
of the jurisdiction of Gotham PD.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.308
Here, I play by my own rules.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.199
Egad!

36:20.279 --> 36:22.034
Batman's flipped his cowl.

36:22.114 --> 36:24.903
If not, we should do it for him.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.317
Ah, time to lighten the mood.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.180
Holy zero Gs!

36:44.936 --> 36:48.694
You were getting so heavy on us, Batman.

37:02.321 --> 37:05.388
Who says penguins can't fly?

37:18.170 --> 37:21.693
Why are your punches like
a bodybuilder without a gym?

37:21.773 --> 37:24.708
Answer, because they're weightless.

37:25.310 --> 37:26.376
You fiends!

37:48.367 --> 37:50.400
Let's do this.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.072
You wanna get nuts?

37:58.726 --> 38:00.548
Let's get nuts.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.820
- Riddler, this is the operating table.
- No, no!

38:21.900 --> 38:24.189
Not the face, Batman.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.291
And I'm the surgeon.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.204
Gee, Batman, will they be okay?

38:39.284 --> 38:42.274
They may forever walk with slight limps

38:42.354 --> 38:43.420
but they'll live.

38:44.256 --> 38:45.610
Look!

38:45.690 --> 38:46.945
Catwoman got away!

38:47.025 --> 38:48.680
That tricky temptress.

38:48.760 --> 38:53.018
She won't escape my grasp
the next time we cross paths.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.998
But I'll enjoy her trying.

38:59.237 --> 39:04.863
Thanks to you, Caped Crusader, their plan
of planetary proliferation was prevented.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.666
I'll just store the Replica Ray
in the Batcave.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.736
It's too dangerous to fall
into the wrong hands.

39:10.816 --> 39:14.373
Once again we owe a debt
of gratitude we can never fully repay.

39:14.453 --> 39:17.141
But know that you will forever be...

39:17.571 --> 39:19.138
Batman?

39:20.125 --> 39:21.546
Where did Batman go?

39:21.626 --> 39:23.715
Begorra! He just disappeared.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.350
Like a bat in the night.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.698
Very dramatic indeed.
And not like Batman at all.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.889
You'll have to forgive him.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.635
He's been a little out of sorts.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.305
Now, if you'll excuse me.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.509
Batman, wait for me!

39:40.011 --> 39:41.233
Batman?

39:41.313 --> 39:42.601
Holy hitchhiker!

39:42.681 --> 39:44.681
Now, how am I going to get back home?

39:51.656 --> 39:54.413
Now, give a hand for our next group,

39:54.493 --> 39:58.383
those manic minstrels from Manchester,

39:58.463 --> 40:01.019
the Bed Bugs!

40:04.269 --> 40:07.225
Sorry, Dick.
I just couldn't bear having to listen

40:07.305 --> 40:09.739
to the Commissioner prattle on anymore.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.576
Luckily, a citizen
loaned me their bicycle.

40:15.480 --> 40:19.137
This Gotham Palace show
is top drawer, old chum.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.706
And that host, Miranda Monroe,

40:21.786 --> 40:24.187
va-va-voom.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.780
Groovy, man, groovy.

40:28.860 --> 40:33.752
Mercy, you two are back from
your "fishing trip" already?

40:33.832 --> 40:36.121
Something wrong with that, Aunt Harriet?

40:36.201 --> 40:39.424
Oh, don't mind me.

40:39.504 --> 40:42.761
Please, tell me exactly what's so amusing.

40:42.841 --> 40:43.995
It's just...

40:44.075 --> 40:46.465
Out with it, you silly old woman!

40:46.545 --> 40:49.134
Heavens! Well, I never...

40:52.717 --> 40:54.473
I can't take this anymore, Bruce!

40:54.553 --> 40:57.809
So, you think I should get
rid of the broad too?

40:57.889 --> 41:00.011
No. I'm talking about you.

41:00.091 --> 41:02.147
You've completely changed.

41:02.227 --> 41:05.517
Now, now, old chum. You're overreacting.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.953
Aren't you even worried about Alfred?

41:08.033 --> 41:12.835
Well, Dickie, if you're so concerned
about Alfred, you're free to join him.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.071
On skid row.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.997
Any progress on that
shoplifting case, O'Hara?

41:52.077 --> 41:57.202
Well, you know, the witness,
uh, and, uh, the, er...

41:57.282 --> 41:59.337
Say no more, Chief.

41:59.417 --> 42:02.185
You don't have to explain to me
how difficult police work can be.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.020
Have you tried...

42:05.624 --> 42:06.823
You know who?

42:08.560 --> 42:11.383
Every 20 minutes. No answer.

42:11.463 --> 42:12.984
Maybe we should try again?

42:13.064 --> 42:14.697
My thoughts exactly.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.252
How about you clean up your
own mess for once?

43:16.194 --> 43:19.784
Yes, but every available officer
is already dispatched.

43:19.864 --> 43:22.120
We'll send someone to you
as soon as we can.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.490
No, we don't know where Batman
is any more than you do.

43:25.570 --> 43:27.325
The city is in chaos.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.372
Absolute chaos.

43:30.642 --> 43:31.941
Greetings, Commissioner.

43:32.877 --> 43:33.932
Chief.

43:34.012 --> 43:36.468
It the Caped Crusader himself!

43:36.548 --> 43:39.804
I must say, you are a sight for sore eyes.

43:39.884 --> 43:44.643
Saints preserve us, all those rosaries
I've been saying have finally paid off.

43:44.723 --> 43:46.511
Where have you been, Batman?

43:46.591 --> 43:48.747
Thinking, Commissioner.

43:48.827 --> 43:52.929
I've been trying to figure out why
you two are in charge of anything.

43:53.765 --> 43:55.654
Surely you jest, Batman.

43:55.734 --> 44:00.391
It's you two who jest by calling
yourselves police officers.

44:02.073 --> 44:06.031
I take a little time off and look
at the state of Gotham City.

44:06.111 --> 44:09.512
Now, please remove your uniforms.

44:10.248 --> 44:11.936
Excuse me, Batman?

44:12.016 --> 44:13.471
I said,

44:13.551 --> 44:16.107
take off your uniforms.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.676
But why would we do that?

44:17.756 --> 44:20.423
Because you two don't
deserve to wear them.

44:23.061 --> 44:25.817
Surely, you understand the
city cannot run without a

44:25.897 --> 44:27.786
Commissioner and Chief of Police.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.120
No need to worry.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.856
I've already found your replacements.

44:31.936 --> 44:34.670
I think you'll find
they're very qualified.

44:35.373 --> 44:36.695
The Replica Ray!

44:36.775 --> 44:38.608
What are you going to do with that?

44:48.453 --> 44:50.019
Three Batmen!

44:52.624 --> 44:57.716
Allow me to introduce Gotham's new
Chief of Police and Commissioner.

44:57.796 --> 45:01.297
Ready to run Gotham
with a firm glove, Batman.

45:03.134 --> 45:04.200
Begorra.

45:06.571 --> 45:08.660
Have you gone mad, Batman?

45:08.740 --> 45:11.563
You've always said there never
was enough of me to go around.

45:11.643 --> 45:14.065
That's no longer a problem.

45:14.145 --> 45:15.900
Chief, Commissioner,

45:15.980 --> 45:20.216
please escort the former Chief
and Commissioner off the premises.

45:23.955 --> 45:27.112
From now on, Batman will
be running this town.

45:27.192 --> 45:29.492
And eventually, the world.

45:38.670 --> 45:43.428
Mr. Mayor, the city no longer
requires your ineffective management.

45:43.508 --> 45:45.541
You're relieved from office.

45:52.016 --> 45:57.286
Semple vs Strozier states any judge
can be replaced by a citizen.

46:01.693 --> 46:05.049
Baking is as much a science as an art.

46:05.129 --> 46:08.931
The city deserves a boulanger
who understands that.

46:48.373 --> 46:49.438
First position.

46:50.041 --> 46:51.107
Second position.

46:54.679 --> 46:56.367
Holy plie.

46:56.447 --> 46:59.304
How am I supposed to focus
on my progressions

46:59.384 --> 47:01.817
when Batman progresses down
a road of darkness?

47:03.354 --> 47:04.809
Progresses.

47:04.889 --> 47:07.445
How did I not see it before?

47:07.525 --> 47:09.614
Catwoman's Batnip did work!

47:09.694 --> 47:11.827
It's just been working slowly.

47:13.932 --> 47:17.199
If I'm going to save Batman,
I need to go to the source.

47:28.947 --> 47:31.013
Sarsaparilla on the rocks.

47:32.550 --> 47:33.616
Please.

47:35.453 --> 47:36.519
Oh!

47:38.623 --> 47:39.689
Ow!

47:44.929 --> 47:49.220
I hope you're proud of what you've
done to Batman, you hateful hussy!

47:49.300 --> 47:52.857
I wanted him to be bad, but not that bad.

47:52.937 --> 47:55.159
You do know the difference, don't you?

47:55.239 --> 47:58.329
Give me the antidote,
you licentious Lucrezia!

47:58.409 --> 48:00.365
There is an antidote, isn't there?

48:00.445 --> 48:02.166
Of course there's an antidote.

48:02.246 --> 48:04.402
We just have to get him to take it.

48:04.482 --> 48:07.338
- We?
- You know how fond I am of Batman.

48:07.418 --> 48:11.910
Were it not for his unfortunate
devotion to good, we'd be an item.

48:11.990 --> 48:14.579
Besides, the way he saved me
from those double crossers,

48:14.659 --> 48:16.514
I suppose I owe him.

48:16.594 --> 48:17.916
Can I trust you?

48:17.996 --> 48:19.061
Cross my heart.

48:20.298 --> 48:22.253
I promise not to kill you.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.055
For now.

48:27.338 --> 48:28.404
Then let's go.

48:29.307 --> 48:30.706
To the Catmobile!

48:34.112 --> 48:36.545
Holy Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!

48:42.520 --> 48:44.876
Are you old enough to drive one of these?

48:44.956 --> 48:47.278
Gosh, yes. I have my learner's permit,

48:47.358 --> 48:50.559
which means I can drive
if another adult is in the vehicle.

48:53.865 --> 48:57.121
Remember, I'll be watching
your every move, Catwoman.

48:57.201 --> 49:00.202
Kid, I always suspected you did.

49:04.809 --> 49:06.497
- Where to?
- The Batcave.

49:06.577 --> 49:09.145
But your gonna have to take
a catnap for this trip.

49:11.983 --> 49:13.471
Very well.

49:13.551 --> 49:15.785
But I expect you to keep your
hands to yourself.

49:41.946 --> 49:47.983
Well, if it isn't the bachelor pad
to end all bachelor pads.

49:53.925 --> 49:56.180
Should we hide before Batman finds us?

49:56.260 --> 49:58.116
He already knows we're here.

49:58.196 --> 50:00.129
Quite right, boy genius.

50:02.900 --> 50:05.857
It was just a matter of time
before you returned.

50:05.937 --> 50:10.728
I'm just surprised you brought
such a lovely guest.

50:10.808 --> 50:14.799
Batman, from the look of things,
you're happy to see me.

50:14.879 --> 50:16.868
You know I am, doll.

50:16.948 --> 50:20.838
Listen, Batman. Catwoman's
Batnip worked, only very slowly.

50:20.918 --> 50:22.840
That's the reason you're acting this way.

50:22.920 --> 50:25.209
Then it's her I have to thank.

50:25.289 --> 50:27.478
I much prefer the new me.

50:27.558 --> 50:32.717
I'm finally doing everything my old
virtuous self wouldn't let me do.

50:32.797 --> 50:34.552
Your ego is out of control.

50:34.632 --> 50:36.187
You've taken over the city!

50:36.267 --> 50:38.222
And that's only the beginning.

50:38.302 --> 50:40.591
What about you, baby? You want to join me?

50:40.671 --> 50:42.693
Isn't that what you wanted all along?

50:42.773 --> 50:44.473
But what about Robin?

50:47.111 --> 50:48.177
Hmm.

50:48.646 --> 50:49.867
I know.

50:49.947 --> 50:51.069
We'll kill him.

50:51.149 --> 50:52.214
Purr-fect.

50:56.487 --> 50:59.655
I'll probably regret this,
but a deal is a deal.

51:03.394 --> 51:07.685
That's the antidote, Batman.
You'll soon be back to your old self.

51:07.765 --> 51:10.455
Wrong, old chum. I anticipated this move

51:10.535 --> 51:13.369
and took the Bat-anti-antidote.

51:15.473 --> 51:17.728
Yup, I knew I'd regret it.

51:17.808 --> 51:19.597
You must be stopped!

51:19.677 --> 51:22.077
Then why don't you try, old chum?

51:25.983 --> 51:31.086
I know every move you'll make, because
I taught you every move you know.

51:34.125 --> 51:37.048
An old-fashioned tool, Robin.

51:37.128 --> 51:39.895
A utility belt showdown. I accept.

51:49.540 --> 51:50.962
Bat-knockout gas!

51:51.042 --> 51:52.263
Bat-wake-up gas!

51:54.212 --> 51:56.177
Bat-cuffs!

51:58.316 --> 52:00.081
Bat-lockpick.

52:01.419 --> 52:02.607
Bat-bomb!

52:02.687 --> 52:03.786
Bat-shield!

52:05.089 --> 52:07.445
Enough of this frivolous folderol.

52:14.432 --> 52:16.432
Sweet dreams, fools.

52:23.241 --> 52:25.774
Comfy, my tenacious twosome?

52:29.947 --> 52:31.335
Holy hydrogen!

52:31.415 --> 52:33.137
The nuclear silo.

52:33.217 --> 52:36.607
When I pull this lever,
you'll be lowered into the silo

52:36.687 --> 52:41.423
at the exact moment it releases
its radioactive steam.

52:42.126 --> 52:44.215
Any last requests?

52:44.295 --> 52:48.686
How 'bout a kiss, masked muscles?

52:48.766 --> 52:50.532
Sure thing, pussycat.

52:57.908 --> 52:59.830
You'll never get away with this, Batman.

52:59.910 --> 53:04.068
Boy, bird-brain, can't you see
we're in the middle of something?

53:04.148 --> 53:05.503
Sorry.

53:08.386 --> 53:10.708
I'm afraid our time's run out.

53:10.788 --> 53:14.056
Perhaps we'll meet again
in your next life, Catwoman.

53:17.762 --> 53:22.153
Now, if you excuse me,
I have a city to rule.

53:38.783 --> 53:40.905
Drat, drat and double drat!

53:40.985 --> 53:42.840
My claws have no effect.

53:42.920 --> 53:46.577
Batman uses a special
Bat-cable that doesn't fray.

53:46.657 --> 53:49.058
Perhaps we can swing
ourselves to the railing.

53:50.127 --> 53:54.418
He raised it three inches, just enough
to prevent us from clearing the rail.

53:54.498 --> 53:56.854
Then how the heck do we get outta here?

53:56.934 --> 53:58.600
I don't think we can.

53:59.470 --> 54:00.669
Brace yourself.

54:18.155 --> 54:19.810
How are we alive?

54:19.890 --> 54:22.380
While you were out on the
drive here, I sprayed us both

54:22.460 --> 54:25.249
with a dose of Bat-anti-isotope spray

54:25.329 --> 54:28.085
to guard us against any radioactivity.

54:28.165 --> 54:30.788
I knew Batman would probably
get the best of us

54:30.868 --> 54:33.991
and that our most likely fate
would be the silo.

54:34.071 --> 54:36.761
Most impressive, Boy Wonder.

54:36.841 --> 54:40.064
I just hope we haven't
lost Batman forever.

54:40.144 --> 54:41.999
We'll need muscle to stop him.

54:42.079 --> 54:45.803
No one's crazy enough
to take on all those Batmen.

54:45.883 --> 54:47.104
You're wrong, Catwoman.

54:47.184 --> 54:48.817
There's a whole prison of them.

54:54.925 --> 54:57.915
We're Gotham State prison inspectors.

54:57.995 --> 55:00.251
I've never heard of prison
inspectors before.

55:00.331 --> 55:01.919
Why wasn't I informed of this?

55:01.999 --> 55:04.088
It's a new position, Warden.

55:04.168 --> 55:07.258
You do want to ensure
the safety of the prisoners

55:07.338 --> 55:10.094
and all that garbage, don't you?

55:10.174 --> 55:12.930
Madame, I assure you, we go by the book.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.476
Oh, is that so?

55:22.953 --> 55:25.009
Those pickaxes aren't up to code!

55:25.089 --> 55:26.677
They must be replaced.

55:26.757 --> 55:29.758
Lucky for you, Warden,
we brought the newest model.

55:38.769 --> 55:41.325
Oh! Look at that!

55:41.405 --> 55:44.462
These are not regulation ball and chains.

55:44.542 --> 55:46.508
Replace them. Now!

55:53.451 --> 55:55.539
And to lift prisoner morale,

55:55.619 --> 55:58.876
the state has required us to give
the prisoners these care packages

55:58.956 --> 56:01.890
of toiletries and wholesome magazines.

56:12.970 --> 56:14.725
What about us?

56:14.805 --> 56:17.395
Sorry, but we're all out.

56:17.475 --> 56:20.097
If I weren't already in jail, I...

56:20.177 --> 56:22.666
Ah! The indignity of it all.

56:22.746 --> 56:25.936
Passed over for these larcenous lowlifes.

56:26.016 --> 56:31.520
Remember, any more violations and you'll
be the ones wearing prison chains.

56:37.094 --> 56:39.061
- Whoa!
- Where do you think you're going? Hey!

57:09.360 --> 57:11.093
Come on, fellas.

57:11.896 --> 57:13.428
Huzzah!

57:21.171 --> 57:22.259
Everyone's gotten away!

57:22.339 --> 57:24.962
Except for these three.

57:25.042 --> 57:28.165
Don't take your eyes off them.
We can't lose them, too.

57:28.245 --> 57:31.067
I won't let them out of my sight.

57:36.387 --> 57:40.244
Welcome to another edition
of Gotham Palace,

57:40.324 --> 57:41.723
with your host...

57:43.093 --> 57:44.482
Batman?

57:44.562 --> 57:46.317
Hello, Gotham City.

57:46.397 --> 57:51.155
Your regular host, Miranda Monroe,
is a bit tied up at the moment.

57:55.239 --> 57:58.195
So, I thought this could be
another job for Batman.

57:58.275 --> 58:02.500
Since taking over Gotham,
I've created the perfect city,

58:02.580 --> 58:05.002
and yet I'm still not sated.

58:05.082 --> 58:07.171
I used to think I dress like a bat

58:07.251 --> 58:10.875
to instill fear into
Gotham's super criminals,

58:10.955 --> 58:14.211
but recently I've come
to realize that, actually,

58:14.291 --> 58:17.748
I just crave attention.

58:20.030 --> 58:23.554
So, what better place to get
that than Gotham Palace?

58:23.634 --> 58:25.523
And to ensure you don't miss a minute,

58:25.603 --> 58:29.159
my Batmen have attached Bat-VHF detonators

58:29.239 --> 58:32.841
to every TV aerial in Gotham City.

58:33.744 --> 58:38.402
If you turn the channel,
or worse, turn off the TV,

58:38.482 --> 58:41.700
your sets will explode!

58:42.586 --> 58:44.375
Holy shrapnel!

58:44.455 --> 58:48.212
Boy Genius? Catwoman? Alive?

58:48.292 --> 58:51.382
Annoying, but not entirely surprising.

58:51.462 --> 58:53.384
We're here to stop you, Batman.

58:53.464 --> 58:56.086
And just how do you two
plan on doing that?

58:56.166 --> 58:58.233
With a little help from our friends.

59:04.508 --> 59:07.831
Then as the milkmaid said
when she kissed her cow,

59:07.911 --> 59:10.545
"The show must go on."

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:15.459
You poor, delinquent child.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:19.296
Those villains are all going
back to Gotham Penitentiary.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:23.167
But I'll deal with you
and Catwoman personally.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:25.402
But there will be no death trap.

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.672
And I won't be conveniently stepping away.

01:01:28.752 --> 01:01:32.076
This time I do it with my own two hands.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:35.724
Special delivery for a Mr. Batman.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.848
That's me.

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:41.552
"To Gotham's newest pop star."

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.932
I'll drink to that.

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:49.403
Refreshing.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.607
Now, time to deal with you.

01:01:54.035 --> 01:01:55.666
Great Scott!

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:58.869
I've been slipped a mickey.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:01.572
Batman, are you okay?

01:02:01.652 --> 01:02:05.275
Back to... To normal.

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:09.413
Old chum, spell broken.

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:12.116
It seems someone delivered me an antidote

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:16.420
that could neutralize
the Bat-anti-antidote.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.556
Holy counter-acting potions! But who?

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.759
I'd be more concerned with them.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:24.005
Quick! Both of you, get behind me.

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:41.790
Holy spontaneous combustion!

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:48.652
Yes, Robin, the duplicates
were always molecularly unstable.

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:50.799
Batman, you've saved the day again!

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:58.262
- From yourself.
- I don't know how you did it.

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:03.333
The credit must really go to
Robin and Catwoman.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:08.071
She proves that even the most
vile, depraved and amoral villain

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:10.974
is capable of redemption.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:13.477
Gee, thanks, Batman.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.480
While all of Gotham is
grateful for her help,

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.615
she must still serve her time.

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:19.983
Understood.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:22.786
Catwoman, thank you for all your help.

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:26.256
I promise to act as a character
witness on your behalf.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:30.360
With good behavior, you'll most
likely get an early parole.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.664
After 15 years or so.

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:37.267
Perhaps there's a better way
to show your gratitude.

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:38.980
And what would that be?

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:55.519
That'll keep me warm on those
cold nights doing hard time.

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:57.365
You'll have to come with us now, ma'am.

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:03.861
It seems everything is
back the way it should be.

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.296
I still want to know who
gave you the antidote.

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:08.376
I'm glad you received the package, sir.

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:10.901
Alfred?

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:14.037
The bond Alfred and I have is unbreakable,

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:17.708
which is why we've had
a long-standing arrangement

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:19.543
that if I were ever to fire him,

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:24.581
it would only be because I was
under some evil mind control.

01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:27.517
And should that happen,
I was to prepare an antidote

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:31.355
according to Batman's precise
instructions and list of ingredients.

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:33.924
I hope it wasn't too difficult, Alfred.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:38.729
It got a bit messy at times,
but went exactly as planned.

01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:41.164
Always one step ahead, Batman.

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:43.211
One step ahead.

01:04:43.814 --> 01:04:47.070
One step ahead.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:50.407
And I've been one step behind
since the very beginning.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:52.509
How could I not see it?

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:53.944
What is it, Batman?

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:55.746
This has all been a well-thought-out

01:04:55.826 --> 01:04:58.749
distraction by Joker, Penguin and Riddler.

01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:02.386
They knew the Replica Ray
was unstable the whole time,

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:06.590
which means they never
planned to duplicate Earth.

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.592
But we sent them up the river.

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:11.128
No, Robin. Don't you see?

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:13.530
We put their duplicates in jail.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.966
They've been free the whole time.

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:17.768
Holy triple-cross!

01:05:17.848 --> 01:05:22.572
And if my guess is right, they knew
Catwoman's Batnip would work,

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:27.110
because the Joker spiked it
with his own laughing-gas formula,

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:29.413
making it more potent.

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:33.450
Those devilish tricksters
needed me as a distraction.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.619
But from what?

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:38.622
Knowing those fiends, it's a crime spree

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:43.560
targeting Gotham's most priceless
treasures and irreplaceable artworks.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.728
Well done, Robin.

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:47.497
Exactly what I was thinking.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:50.500
- The perfect crime.
- Almost.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.980
Let's go!

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:58.008
Holy stowaway!

01:05:58.088 --> 01:06:01.645
My feline pride won't allow me
to let those traitors go unpunished.

01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:03.113
I want to help.

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:04.648
Please, Catwoman.

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.483
Those venal villains are committing

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:10.454
the biggest heist
Gotham City has ever seen.

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.189
You'd be in danger.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:16.493
You do remember they tried to
shoot me into space. Yes?

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:20.308
Very well. After all you've done,
you've earned the right to join us.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:34.177
Ah. We did it.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:37.258
Our most perfect plan ever.

01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:40.851
Look at our haul.

01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:44.932
Priceless treasures
and irreplaceable artwork!

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.994
The first puzzle ever created.

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:55.499
Four thousand years old,
and worth a king's ransom.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:59.569
Ah! That rock's nothing
compared to my little nest egg,

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:04.273
encrusted with a million bucks
worth of diamonds and emeralds.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:09.079
And at last, I finally got
my hands on this beauty.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:13.083
A clown painting?

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:14.851
That's worthless.

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:19.423
Oh, Pengi, the value in art
isn't in how much it costs,

01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:22.258
it's in how it makes you feel.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.897
Besides, it will be worth lots
once I bump off the artist.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:33.170
You filthy criminals!

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:36.206
And to think you almost got away with it.

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:39.609
But no one can outsmart
Batman for very long.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:43.747
Egad! He's back to his old,
obnoxiously good self.

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:47.050
If we can't outsmart him,
then we'd better outrun him.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:49.519
Hurry, men, or it's curtains!

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:53.090
The prodigal Penguin
always comes prepared.

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:03.244
Quickly! To the Whirly-Bat!

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:10.952
Look, Batman, it's their getaway vehicle.

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:19.894
A blimp. Unorthodox, but diabolical.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:28.390
Whose idea was it to get such
a slow-moving getaway car?

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.926
Patience, my quizzical quipster.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.207
Observe.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:43.607
Robin, time to use our exploding
Batterangs on those engines.

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:45.075
Holy Hindenburg!

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.444
If we miss the mark,
it'll go up in flames.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.957
Which is why our aim must be true.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:53.795
Ready? One, two, three!

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:03.760
They've blown our engines,
you beaked boob!

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.296
Silence! Then we must move the fray

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:10.433
to where this bird of prey
has the advantage.

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.693
They're gone.

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.663
Wrong. They've just gone up.

01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:37.305
Hand over those priceless treasures
and irreplaceable artworks.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:41.698
You fiends!

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:47.136
You'll be abstract art once you splat
onto the pavement, Batman.

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:14.309
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:10:22.919 --> 01:10:24.152
Thanks?

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:30.284
End of the line, Joker.

01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:29.177
Well done, old chum.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:35.739
We saved Gotham's priceless treasures
and irreplaceable artworks.

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:38.152
Yes. Saved them from me.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:42.412
Ta-ta, my stalwart stooges.

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:46.060
This cat's ready to walk
on the wild side again.

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:56.025
Catwoman, consider
the consequences of your actions.

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:59.529
You know a tiger can't
change her stripes, Batman.

01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:03.211
Please. By all that's decent,
I beg of you.

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:08.238
I'll give myself up on one condition.

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:09.539
What's that?

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.574
We run away to Europe together,

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:16.746
sip tea in a cafe,
and live happily ever after.

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:20.016
Holy unsatisfying ending.

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:21.996
And, of course, we kill Robin.

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.433
Catwoman, you know I can't.

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.336
Oh!

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.430
- Give me your hand.
- I'm sorry, Batman,

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.432
but I won't be put in a cage again.

01:13:38.882 --> 01:13:40.114
No.

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:47.255
Catwoman.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:56.297
Loving you was wrong,
but I had to do right.

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:12.135
Oh, land's sake,

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:15.572
what a wonderful birthday
you've thrown for me, boys.

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:17.574
Did we surprise you, Aunt Harriet?

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:19.242
Did you?

01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:22.612
I knew you two were trying to
keep a secret from me.

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:25.248
But I never suspected it was this.

01:14:25.328 --> 01:14:27.984
There's not much we could keep from you.

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:30.453
The lengths you went to.

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:32.655
And I was beginning to think
you kept me around

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:35.325
only for appearances.

01:14:35.405 --> 01:14:38.261
Appearances, Aunt Harriet? How so?

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:41.331
Oh, simply that the famous Bruce Wayne

01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:44.100
didn't have room for his ward's old aunt.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.437
But now I know I'm a valued
part of the family,

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:49.973
and I needn't be so insecure.

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:53.009
And you can put an end
to the fishing ruse.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:54.655
- I promise I won't...
- Sir.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.383
Uh, you'll have to excuse us,
Aunt Harriet.

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:02.118
Where are you two going?

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:04.287
The party's just started.

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:06.456
Why, skeet shooting of course.

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.035
See you later, Aunt Harriet.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:10.805
Oh, yes, of course.
