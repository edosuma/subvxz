WEBVTT

00:06.049 --> 00:07.703
Wow. I can't believe

00:07.746 --> 00:10.706
you sleep in a bed every night.

00:10.749 --> 00:15.754
Ooh, a girl could really get
used to this pillow business.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.539
Yep, I could've used one.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.932
God, hey, would you mind

00:19.976 --> 00:22.065
rubbing this knot
in my shoulder, Nancy?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.936
Hey, hey, hey.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.329
You know the rules.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.201
This is a fake relationship,

00:27.244 --> 00:30.900
so I am not rubbing
any of your man parts.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.163
I mean, technically,
everyone has shoulders.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.078
Ooh, now how about
we head downstairs

00:35.122 --> 00:38.299
and get that living butler
to make us something to smell

00:38.342 --> 00:39.517
for breakfast?

00:39.561 --> 00:40.605
You mean Sam?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.042
She's actually a writer

00:42.085 --> 00:43.956
and a small business owner,
she's not our butler.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.176
Oh, okay, okay.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.004
Too good to be a butler.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.789
You know, when I was alive,
women couldn't even be a butler.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.401
You could be a wench,
a midwife or a whore.

00:53.444 --> 00:56.186
Oh, well, that's not something

00:56.230 --> 00:58.580
I feel particularly
compelled to follow up on.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.810
Oh, that's Bela.
She'll be here in an hour.

01:11.854 --> 01:14.944
And now you'll probably explain
to a room full of ghosts

01:14.987 --> 01:16.337
who Bela is.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.774
I mean, was curious, yes.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.036
Bela's Jay's sister.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.472
She lives in Boston,
she's coming to visit.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.344
- Oh.
- Oh, must be nice.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.650
All my sisters died
before the age of two.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.262
Damn, Isaac, we ain't even
smelled our morning coffee yet.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.351
Bela's boyfriend
broke up with her last week,

01:30.394 --> 01:32.222
so she's coming to stay
to clear her head.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.876
How is she doing now, Jay?

01:33.919 --> 01:36.748
I talked to her a few days ago,
and she's still really down.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.707
Oh, that's great.
Excuse me?

01:38.750 --> 01:40.230
No, I mean, it's awful.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.710
It's just, you know,

01:41.753 --> 01:44.016
I excel in helping girlfriends
get over breakups.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.454
I hope she really likes
the <i>Legally Blonde</i> franchise,

01:46.497 --> 01:48.543
'cause that is gonna be
a big part of her next 48 hours.

01:48.586 --> 01:51.850
Okay, let's just try
not to act too excited.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.156
Sorry, sorry.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.462
It's just, I thought
this could be a chance

01:54.505 --> 01:56.072
for she and I to finally bond.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.987
Look, I don't have
siblings,

01:58.030 --> 02:00.337
so when you and I got married,
I thought Bela and I

02:00.381 --> 02:02.687
could become sisters,
but that hasn't happened.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.124
Excuse me,

02:04.167 --> 02:06.691
but in what room will
this Bela be sleeping?

02:06.735 --> 02:08.911
Oh, right.
Well, I guess one of you guys

02:08.954 --> 02:10.521
will have to give up
your room for the weekend.

02:12.523 --> 02:13.785
Sorry.
Okay.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.961
I have plan.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.659
Thor, we can't kill Bela.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.878
It's not what I was

02:19.922 --> 02:21.663
going to say, but, uh,

02:21.706 --> 02:25.145
give Thor a moment to think
of what I was going to say.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.495
Not kill.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.236
Troops,

02:29.279 --> 02:31.107
Samantha has informed us that
one of us will be required

02:31.151 --> 02:33.979
to forfeit our rooms.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.198
Can't the sister just
take the empty bedroom?

02:35.242 --> 02:36.504
We offered that,

02:36.547 --> 02:39.202
but Samantha is aware
of the mold and the draft.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.248
You got to sell the view.
When I was pushing penny stocks,

02:41.291 --> 02:42.814
you think I emphasized the risk?

02:42.858 --> 02:44.599
No, you shine that turd.

02:44.642 --> 02:45.948
I call not it.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.341
Is unbreakable oath.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.343
Oh, please, that is how
children make decisions.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.040
But also, not it.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.085
Trevor is the most recently
dead, let him take it.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.610
Ooh, that's how we divvied
things up in the first place.

02:55.653 --> 02:58.830
This time we do it
in reserve order of seniority.

02:58.874 --> 03:01.746
Thor not like this. This
is bad outcome for Thor.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.448
The sanctity of my room
will not be...

03:07.491 --> 03:08.927
Hey! Hey! Guys!

03:08.971 --> 03:10.929
I can't stand
to watch you fight.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.409
I will take the room.
Oh.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.150
- You sure, Pete?
- Yeah. You know,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.238
a little mold
never hurt anybody.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.413
It'll
be like camping.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.372
Then it's settled.
Thank you, Pete,

03:18.415 --> 03:19.634
for your sacrifice,
and for your sake,

03:19.677 --> 03:20.983
I hope that the rain holds out

03:21.026 --> 03:22.332
so you don't have to deal
with that pesky leak.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.247
Uh? Oh, sorry,

03:24.291 --> 03:26.075
the-the-- there's a leak
in there now?

03:26.118 --> 03:27.772
Be even more like camping.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.078
- True.
- Nature.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.994
Nature. Yay!

03:36.259 --> 03:37.695
Okay, that must be her.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.132
Let the girl bonding begin.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.615
LL Uncool Jay.

03:44.659 --> 03:45.703
'Cause that never gets old.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.357
Hey.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.968
Hey.
- Hey, Sam.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.057
Hi. Oh, I don't need a nickname,

03:52.101 --> 03:54.146
but Manhattan Sam Chowder
could be something

03:54.190 --> 03:55.670
if you're looking for one.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.715
What? You mean New England?

03:57.759 --> 03:59.064
Manhattan is a soup, as well.

03:59.108 --> 04:02.807
It's also where I lived,
so it's tomato-based.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.201
This is painful.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.030
Yeah, I can't watch this.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.075
Oh, this place is epic.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.686
Okay.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.862
It is so good to see you guys.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.298
It's good to
see you, too.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.300
I wish it could have been
under better circumstances.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.650
Oh, but don't worry. I have
the perfect night planned

04:19.694 --> 04:21.565
to help you get over that jerk.

04:21.609 --> 04:24.481
Oh, guys, it's cool.
I'm so over him.

04:24.525 --> 04:25.439
What's that?

04:25.482 --> 04:27.354
- I met someone new.
- Already?

04:27.397 --> 04:29.356
- Wow.
- So you don't need, like,

04:29.399 --> 04:30.792
any cheering up at all, huh?

04:30.835 --> 04:32.228
That's great.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.186
There goes that plan.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.579
Yeah, I set my dating profile

04:35.623 --> 04:37.538
to the Hudson Valley
a couple days ago,

04:37.581 --> 04:39.757
'cause I knew I was gonna be
up here, and then boom,

04:39.801 --> 04:42.020
I matched
with this insanely hot guy.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.805
We've been
messaging,

04:43.848 --> 04:45.372
and we're really vibing.

04:45.415 --> 04:46.373
Do you want to see him?

04:46.416 --> 04:47.809
Yeah, sure.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.899
Oh, dang. I got to stop
leaving my house on 17%.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.031
Well, I'm gonna drop my bags
and grab a charge.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.119
I'll show you the way.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.081
Sorry Jay's sister's
not devastated, Sam.

04:59.124 --> 05:02.040
Yes, we are here for you.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.564
Thanks, guys.

05:03.607 --> 05:07.263
So, you just gave away
our pillow palace

05:07.307 --> 05:09.352
to some rando's sister?

05:09.396 --> 05:11.180
It's not some rando. It's Jay.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.269
Who the hell's Jay?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.140
- Sam's husband?
- Huh?

05:15.184 --> 05:17.317
The living butler's husband?

05:17.360 --> 05:20.711
Oh, face it, Pete.
You're a pushover.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.147
Because I gave in
on one little thing

05:22.191 --> 05:24.280
in the interest
of house harmony?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.283
You didn't give in on one thing.
You give in on everything.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.632
You told me yourself

05:28.676 --> 05:30.634
you never get to pick the movie
on movie night.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.332
- Well, that's true.
- And you're

05:32.375 --> 05:34.943
always the caboose
- in the massage train.
- I mean,

05:34.986 --> 05:37.989
- someone's got to be.
- Why can't it be a circle, huh?

05:38.033 --> 05:41.297
That way, everyone gets
their man parts rubbed.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.387
Again, shoulders
- are not specific to men.
- You start

05:44.431 --> 05:46.128
standing up for yourself

05:46.171 --> 05:47.608
and get our room back,

05:47.651 --> 05:51.046
or I will tell everyone
our relationship is fake

05:51.089 --> 05:54.354
and that you have a huge crush
on Alberta.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.268
You know,
there's a certain irony

05:56.312 --> 05:58.880
to you strong-arming me
into being less of a pushover.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.404
That did not escape me, Pete.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.886
Housekeeping.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.499
And we are charged. Do
- you want to see the guy?
Oh.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.022
- Yes, please.
- Okay, now,

06:11.066 --> 06:12.546
he's not my normal type.
He comes off

06:12.589 --> 06:14.417
as this, like,
douchey finance bro.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.679
And he is a little,

06:15.723 --> 06:18.203
but he's also,
like, really sensitive.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.685
Damn, Bela!

06:21.729 --> 06:24.645
- Get it, girl. This dude is hot.
- Right?

06:25.689 --> 06:27.343
Oh, my God.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.391
He's really something.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.827
I can explain.

06:37.266 --> 06:41.401
Look, I don't see what's wrong.
I mean, that guy seems great.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.359
Not to mention, so dreamy.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.926
- Wow. That's so kind.
- No.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.363
I don't want another word out
of you unless it's explaining

06:47.407 --> 06:48.495
why my sister-in-law
was chatting

06:48.538 --> 06:49.931
to a guy
with your profile picture.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.802
Whose picture?
The guy in the photo,

06:51.846 --> 06:53.717
Trevor?

06:53.761 --> 06:56.459
No pants? The one who
keeps hitting on you?

06:56.503 --> 06:59.331
How come you never told me
- about those cheekbones?
Okay,

06:59.375 --> 07:01.508
- starting to warm up to this guy.
- You.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.901
Just out with it.
What the hell is going on?

07:03.945 --> 07:06.730
I may have made myself
- a dating profile.
- What?

07:06.774 --> 07:09.951
- How?
- Well, it all started a few months back.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.562
<i>I was minding my own business,</i> <i>
hoping I might get lucky</i>

07:12.606 --> 07:14.564
<i>and see a painter</i> <i>
fall off his ladder.</i>

07:14.608 --> 07:16.653
<i>When you've been dead 20 years,</i> <i>
it's the little things</i>

07:16.697 --> 07:18.002
<i>that really keep you going.</i>

07:18.046 --> 07:19.830
- Please get to the point.
- Right. Anyway,

07:19.874 --> 07:23.617
<i>he took a break, and nothing
prepared me for what I saw next.</i>

07:25.532 --> 07:27.185
<i>So many women.</i>

07:27.229 --> 07:29.013
 <i>
So many varieties.</i>

07:29.057 --> 07:31.146
<i>Short women. Tall women.</i> <i>
Platinum blondes.</i>

07:31.189 --> 07:34.149
<i>Dirty blondes.</i> <i>
Strawberry blondes.</i><i>This is painful.</i>

07:34.192 --> 07:35.455
The humble craftsman

07:35.498 --> 07:38.109
<i>had shown me a brave new world,</i>

07:38.153 --> 07:40.198
<i>and I knew right away</i> <i>
that I wanted in.</i>

07:40.242 --> 07:42.679
<i>So, for the next month,</i> <i>
I studied.</i>

07:42.723 --> 07:46.422
<i>I learned how to download apps.
I asked all the right questions.</i>

07:46.466 --> 07:48.206
Oh, what a cute
little stinker.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.426
How exactly did
you save that?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.124
- In detail.
- Oh, it's easy.

07:53.168 --> 07:56.301
You just press down, and
the menu pops up, and...

07:56.345 --> 07:57.781
Interesting.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.392
<i>And eventually</i> <i>
I was ready to put my plan</i>

08:00.436 --> 08:01.829
<i>into action.</i>

08:05.049 --> 08:06.747
He used the kitchen iPad.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.489
I knew we needed
a better password than 1234.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.099
You're right. I should
have anticipated

08:11.142 --> 08:13.493
a ghost catfishing
- my sister.
- Wait,

08:13.536 --> 08:15.190
how did you get a picture
of yourself?

08:15.233 --> 08:17.627
It took weeks of sneaking down

08:17.671 --> 08:19.760
<i>night after night,</i> <i>
working letter by letter.</i>

08:19.803 --> 08:22.327
<i>Sam, I was like Andy Dufresne</i> <i>
chiseling</i>

08:22.371 --> 08:23.981
<i>through to a new life</i> <i>
with a little rock hammer.</i>

08:24.025 --> 08:25.374
Andy Dufresne? Who's that?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.028
Seriously? <i>Shawshank.</i> <i>Shawshank.</i>

08:27.071 --> 08:28.595
Come on, babe.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.597
<i>Finally,</i> <i>
after all that toiling...</i>

08:32.729 --> 08:34.905
<i>...it was done.</i>

08:34.949 --> 08:37.125
<i>The perfect profile.</i>

08:43.523 --> 08:46.482
<i>And then, one fateful night,</i> <i>
I started getting matches.</i>

08:48.702 --> 08:50.573
And then two days ago,
I matched with Jay's sister.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.444
And then a couple days ago,
he matched with Bela.

08:52.488 --> 08:55.317
They feel pain when
- we pass through them, right?
- Jay.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.407
Is he seri...

08:58.450 --> 09:00.104
Where are you?

09:00.148 --> 09:02.846
Ooh. Aah!

09:02.890 --> 09:04.631
- Oh!
- Did I get him?

09:04.674 --> 09:06.241
Yeah, really good.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.808
I'm sorry.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.679
The only thing that hurts more

09:09.723 --> 09:11.986
than knowing that I died
before finding true love

09:12.029 --> 09:14.336
is knowing that I died before
I could crush it on these apps.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.338
What was your endgame, Trevor?

09:16.381 --> 09:18.253
I just wanted the validation,
I guess.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.602
But then Bela showed up
at the house,

09:19.646 --> 09:22.083
and I realized those are
real people on those apps.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.912
Or maybe they're other
super motivated ghosts like me,

09:24.955 --> 09:26.348
but that seems less likely.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.350
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

09:28.393 --> 09:29.656
I'm sorry.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.875
It's really lonely
being a ghost.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.747
I miss having that connection
with someone new,

09:33.790 --> 09:36.358
that hope
that she might be the one.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.621
I'm never gonna get that again.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.970
Aw.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.624
No! I'm still mad.

09:41.668 --> 09:45.193
Ooh, Sam,
this is really, really bad.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.369
Bela was so upset when
Gabe broke up with her.

09:47.412 --> 09:50.024
Her emoji use was unhinged.

09:50.067 --> 09:53.027
If she finds out
she was catfished now...

09:53.070 --> 09:55.507
Well, you wanted a reason
- to cheer her up.
No.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.248
I actually wanted to help her

09:57.292 --> 09:59.250
through a normal
but difficult situation.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.905
I didn't want her destroyed
by some dead frat bro.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.994
Oh, we are going
to have to play this

10:04.038 --> 10:05.517
very delicately.

10:05.561 --> 10:06.649
I got it.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.695
Trevor has to "move."

10:08.738 --> 10:10.218
Yes.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.959
To somewhere far away

10:12.002 --> 10:14.570
and unappealing. Because
she's my sister. I love her.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.572
But she's very thirsty,
and she could follow him.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.531
I mean, I saw that jawline.
It's like granite.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.098
Love this guy.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.752
Howdy, folks.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.798
This will just take a minute.
Wh-What is this?

10:24.841 --> 10:27.322
Isaac and I were in the middle
of a riveting debate on scarves.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.630
You got this, Pete.
Just like we practiced.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.762
Listen up, ghosts.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.808
I have spent the
last 40 years

10:34.851 --> 10:36.679
bending over backwards
to compromise

10:36.723 --> 10:38.899
for the sake of
house harmony,

10:38.942 --> 10:40.901
but I'm here to
tell you I'm done.

10:40.944 --> 10:44.165
I've had it up to my arrow
with all of your applesauce.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.557
It's time for Pete

10:45.601 --> 10:46.820
to finally get
what he wants.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.169
And he wants

10:48.212 --> 10:50.432
a mold-free room,
so one of you

10:50.475 --> 10:53.609
is making way
for Pete and his girl.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.525
If that's amenable
to everyone.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.266
Or even if it's not.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.615
Yeah.
Also,

10:59.659 --> 11:00.703
I will no longer
be the caboose

11:00.747 --> 11:01.922
on the massage train.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.664
I lead it now.
I'm the engine.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.839
You hear that?

11:05.882 --> 11:08.493
- Let's go.
- All right.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.977
Well, the moment we all feared
has arrived.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.719
Pete's developed a spine.
This is

11:16.763 --> 11:18.765
an unfortunate turn of events.

11:18.808 --> 11:19.983
What are y'all
talking about?

11:20.027 --> 11:21.289
Pete's finally sticking
up for himself,

11:21.332 --> 11:22.507
and you think
that's a bad thing?

11:22.551 --> 11:23.944
Need I remind you
what it was like

11:23.987 --> 11:25.467
before that saint of a man

11:25.510 --> 11:27.251
was felled by a
little girl's arrow?

11:27.295 --> 11:29.601
No one compromised on
anything around here.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.733
Isaac is right.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.430
Pete's spinelessness is

11:32.474 --> 11:35.564
the grease that keeps the wheels
of our little world turning.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.740
We had people like Pete
in Viking society.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.568
We sacrificed them,

11:39.611 --> 11:43.267
then gave their blood to please
our gods and prevent famine.

11:43.311 --> 11:46.444
They were respected.
Dead but respected.

11:46.488 --> 11:47.750
Well,

11:47.794 --> 11:49.317
I like this new Pete.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.145
He's got gumption.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.538
And maybe the answer isn't him
going back to the way he was.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.627
Maybe the answer is all of us

11:55.671 --> 11:59.153
actually learning
to compromise for once.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.765
There's got to be
- a better way.
- That's not happening.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.812
Hey,

12:05.855 --> 12:07.422
Bela, what's wrong?

12:07.465 --> 12:10.817
Turns out Trevor's
a lying piece of trash.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.427
He told me
he's moving to Newfoundland,

12:12.470 --> 12:13.950
which sounds made-up.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.996
I told you, we should
have gone with Mykonos.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.607
- It could be real.
- Mm, yeah. He could've moved there.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.740
Although, obviously,

12:20.783 --> 12:24.395
it's too far and cold
to visit or follow someone to.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.006
Mm, something's off.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.659
I'm looking this asshat up.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.574
See if he's even
who he says he is.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.360
You don't know his last name.
How could you even do that?

12:32.403 --> 12:33.796
Oh, I just do
a reverse image search

12:33.840 --> 12:35.624
with his profile photo.
Oh.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.669
That's so cool
that you can do that.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.717
This picture's from an obituary,

12:41.761 --> 12:44.154
and the guy died 20 years ago.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.113
It's the only picture
- of me on the Internet.
Oh, my God.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.767
Do you know what this means?

12:48.637 --> 12:49.899
I got catfished.

12:49.943 --> 12:50.987
- No.
- What?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.032
This is messed-up.

12:52.075 --> 12:53.555
He is not getting away
with this.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.297
"Hey, doucher,
I know you're not real.

12:56.340 --> 13:00.083
And BT dubs,
catfishing is so ten years ago."

13:00.127 --> 13:01.476
[iPad chimes]"Who are you?

13:01.519 --> 13:03.478
Some thousand-year-old virgin?"

13:07.569 --> 13:10.050
Bela, wait.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.186
Why does that sound keep
coming from your iPad?

13:16.230 --> 13:18.145
Great question.
Why don't you hand it over,

13:18.188 --> 13:19.407
and I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.061
Unlock the iPad, Jay.

13:21.104 --> 13:24.107
I would, but I-I forgot
- the passcode.
- Well, luckily,

13:24.151 --> 13:26.588
it's been the same
since junior high. 1234.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.334
<i>You're</i> Trevor?

13:39.601 --> 13:41.342
Okay, I am freaking out
right now.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.647
Bela,
it's not what it looks like.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.301
We just invited you up
to the house

13:44.345 --> 13:46.216
because we wanted
to cheer you up.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.958
You thought creating Trevor
would cheer me up?

13:49.002 --> 13:50.568
- Ew. No.
- Oh, no.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.396
You didn't think
I could find a real man again,

13:52.440 --> 13:54.703
so you created a fake one
to flirt with me

13:54.746 --> 13:57.053
- and compliment my smile.
- I really meant that.

13:57.097 --> 13:59.577
And you made up a guy that is exactly

13:59.621 --> 14:00.840
everything I'm looking for.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.624
Someone who loves clubbing

14:02.667 --> 14:04.060
and the Hamptons

14:04.104 --> 14:06.019
and jam bands
from the late '90s.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.803
We're freaking meant
for each other.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.935
That's not what happened.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.198
Then what did happen?I...

14:11.241 --> 14:13.896
don't have a good explanation.

14:13.940 --> 14:14.984
You guys are sick.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.986
I'm packing my bags and leaving.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.903
I mean, we sexted.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.470
Ugh!

14:22.513 --> 14:25.255
I didn't know it had a name.

14:26.822 --> 14:29.607
That's Hetty,
Alberta, oh, and me.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.740
Three against one, Thor,
you must give up your room

14:31.783 --> 14:33.437
to Pete and the filthy one.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.918
Mm-mm. Thor not moving.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.311
But we voted.

14:37.354 --> 14:40.009
Thor not believe in democracy.
Oh,

14:40.053 --> 14:42.882
- how convenient.
- Fine. I change my vote to Isaac.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.840
- Me, too.
- Weasels!

14:44.884 --> 14:45.928
All of you.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.364
They're hurting
each other's feelings.

14:47.408 --> 14:48.713
I have to put a stop to this.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.193
Oh, here we go.
Out of my room!

14:50.237 --> 14:53.675
Spineless Pete worming his
way back to the surface.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.286
Do you want to know
why I compromise, Nancy?

14:56.330 --> 14:57.809
- Yeah.
- I'm modeling

14:57.853 --> 14:59.507
for these people. Yes,

14:59.550 --> 15:01.944
it's been 40 years, and, yes,
they're not exactly picking up

15:01.988 --> 15:04.207
what I'm laying down,
but I believe in them.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.992
They have good in them.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.211
And eventually
they're gonna get there.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.952
And until that time,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.954
I'm gonna keep
setting an example.

15:11.998 --> 15:15.610
That's BS. You're just scared
of someone not liking you.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.264
Oh, yeah?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.961
Yeah, you wimp.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.136
That is enough!

15:20.180 --> 15:21.442
...powder off your wig.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.705
I cannot take one more
minute of your bullying!

15:23.748 --> 15:26.186
You want me to stand up
for myself and have a spine?

15:26.229 --> 15:29.015
Well, here we go!
It is over between us.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.582
I am done listening to you.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.975
So if you have something
you want to say to everyone,

15:33.019 --> 15:35.195
- you just go ahead and say it.
- Fine!

15:39.677 --> 15:42.724
I'm going back down
to the basement

15:42.767 --> 15:44.160
'cause I just broke up

15:44.204 --> 15:46.858
with my very real boyfriend

15:46.902 --> 15:49.861
and, also, 'cause
you all suck,

15:49.905 --> 15:53.517
and I'd rather be with the
cholera pit people. Huh.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.564
Proud of you, Petey.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.351
Now, you listen up good.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.005
I'm taking the moldy room,

16:03.049 --> 16:05.312
and I don't want to hear
another word about it.

16:07.096 --> 16:10.317
Yeah. That's what I thought.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.059
Does that mean
she's single now?

16:14.103 --> 16:15.104
Bela.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.410
I have nothing
to say to you two.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.672
No, no, you have to trust

16:17.715 --> 16:18.978
that we weren't trying
to hurt you.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.675
It doesn't matter
what you were trying to do.

16:20.718 --> 16:23.112
You thought I was so pathetic
that the best way

16:23.156 --> 16:25.593
to help me
was to concoct some giant lie.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.989
I don't think I'll ever be able
to forgive you.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.036
- It was a ghost.
- What?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.473
Babe, are you sure
- about this?
- Look, I know

16:36.517 --> 16:37.953
that this is
gonna sound crazy,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.303
but if it has any chance of
salvaging this relationship,

16:40.347 --> 16:41.783
I have to come clean.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.916
A few months ago, I
fell down the stairs

16:44.960 --> 16:47.745
and I went into a coma. Thank
you for the flowers, by the way.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.965
And when I woke up,
I could see ghosts.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.794
Trevor died in this
house 20 years ago.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.057
And he doesn't wear pants,
which may not seem relevant,

16:55.101 --> 16:57.233
but it's something I have
to know, and now you do, too.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.843
Anyhow, somehow,

16:58.887 --> 17:00.454
he managed to create
a dating profile,

17:00.497 --> 17:03.370
and th-the important part of
the story is, I see ghosts.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.067
And besides Jay,

17:05.111 --> 17:06.634
you're the only person
I've ever told.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.810
I know this must be

17:08.853 --> 17:11.421
difficult to believe, but
I sincerely hope you do.

17:11.465 --> 17:12.857
Honestly, Sam,

17:12.901 --> 17:14.511
get help.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.559
Bela.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.083
Bela, hold up.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.346
Look, I'm not crazy,

17:23.390 --> 17:24.434
or-or at least
I'm not lying.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.480
And I can prove it.
Thor, lights.

17:26.523 --> 17:27.698
Sam, chair!

17:27.742 --> 17:29.439
No, get the lights.

17:29.483 --> 17:30.962
Oh, right, yes.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.142
What was that?

17:36.185 --> 17:37.795
Alberta, hum us a tune.

17:37.839 --> 17:38.970
Oh, finally.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.632
Okay, that's a trick.
Secret switches, speakers.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.939
- Isaac?
- Hmm? What? Oh, uh, you know what?

17:50.982 --> 17:52.593
No, I'll pass. Thank you.
Isaac,

17:52.636 --> 17:54.377
- please.
- Fine.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.818
Oh! That is nasty.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.690
Okay, it's no picnic
- for me, either.
Okay,

18:02.733 --> 18:04.126
what is happening?

18:04.170 --> 18:05.562
You just met
some of the ghosts.

18:05.606 --> 18:08.696
I can tell you
what's in your bag. Pete.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.961
We got a pair of hiking boots.
A pair

18:13.004 --> 18:15.224
of hiking boots. A beanie.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.791
Three unread back issues

18:16.834 --> 18:18.140
of <i>The New Yorker.</i>
Three unread back issues

18:18.184 --> 18:20.011
of <i>The New Yorker.</i>
And-- I'm just saying this

18:20.055 --> 18:21.752
to prove a point--
a personal massager.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.277
Oh, why you got to tell me that?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.017
How many fingers
am I holding up?

18:28.194 --> 18:29.978
Three.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.111
Holy crap.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.374
You can see ghosts?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.419
What is personal massager?

18:41.207 --> 18:42.599
So, ghosts don't eat,

18:42.643 --> 18:43.644
but they sleep?

18:43.687 --> 18:44.906
And they don't go
to the bathroom?

18:44.949 --> 18:47.169
Then what about... you know?

18:47.213 --> 18:48.997
Yeah, surprisingly,
that one's a yes.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.564
Wow. And, like,

18:50.607 --> 18:52.435
could a ghost do it
with a human?

18:52.479 --> 18:54.437
No. You know what?
I'm not there yet.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.831
Please don't tell anyone
about this, Bela.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.137
Your secret's safe with me.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.442
Hey,

18:59.486 --> 19:02.228
am I really the only one
you've told besides Jay?

19:02.271 --> 19:03.620
Yeah.
Wow,

19:03.664 --> 19:06.188
I can't believe that.
That really means a lot.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.235
Kind of makes me feel really
close to you.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.236
Is that stupid?

19:10.279 --> 19:11.846
No, I don't think that's stupid.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.674
You know, I always
kind of wanted a sister.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.893
Instead, all I got
was this dork.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.982
She made me wear a
dress till I was five.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.375
Did you say "sister"?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.247
Yeah,
don't be an idiot about it.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.206
Don't <i>you</i> be an idiot about it. Okay.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.903
Jay, I'm doing
sister banter.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.209
Nice work, babe.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.342
I'd like to say goodbye

19:29.385 --> 19:30.647
to Bela if I could.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.823
I don't think anybody wants
to hear from you.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.390
What?
Oh, it's a ghost thing.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.826
You'll get used
to it pretty fast.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.741
Trevor's here.
He wants a word.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.048
It's okay.
I'm willing to hear him out.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.267
Really?

19:41.310 --> 19:42.485
Fine.

19:42.529 --> 19:43.834
Okay, this is gonna be
awkward for me,

19:43.878 --> 19:45.314
so I'm gonna leave the
three of you to it.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.751
Or however many
of you there are.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.754
Okay, Trevor, this
better be good.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.669
Bela, I'm sorry I lied to you.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.932
"Bela, I'm sorry I lied to you."

19:54.976 --> 19:57.674
But the connection that we had,
that wasn't a lie.

19:57.718 --> 20:00.111
I meant every word that I said.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.679
"I do love your eyes

20:02.723 --> 20:04.420
and your smile."

20:04.464 --> 20:05.726
And your boobs.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.685
You forgot the boobs.
Nope.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.078
Just keep going.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.733
I talk a big game,

20:12.776 --> 20:14.952
but the truth is,

20:14.996 --> 20:17.564
I really did want to find
someone to spend my life with,

20:17.607 --> 20:19.870
and I didn't.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.656
Life is way too short.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.223
I used to think that was

20:24.266 --> 20:26.660
a dumb thing that people said,
but it's really true.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.186
Go find yourself someone
who's as incredible as you.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.755
Because that's what you deserve.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.583
"Because that's
what you deserve."

20:37.627 --> 20:39.281
Thank you, Trevor.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.761
Also, please send nudes.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.936
And we're done.
