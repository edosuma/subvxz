WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:09.140
NURSE:
<i> Relax, it's just a shot.</i>

00:09.142 --> 00:12.143
Rutnam, Rutnam,
take it easy.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.344
Just calm down.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.045
Hey, no one's
gonna hurt you.

00:15.047 --> 00:16.179
No one's gonna hurt you.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.081
Okay, okay, okay, I'm cool.

00:24.488 --> 00:27.155
Okay.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.525
(grunting)

00:33.762 --> 00:35.628
Oh!

00:35.630 --> 00:37.463
(grunting)

00:58.051 --> 00:59.649
GUARD:
Hey!

01:02.487 --> 01:05.721
Be safe out there, okay?

01:05.723 --> 01:07.289
Thanks.

01:22.405 --> 01:24.538
Hey! What the hell?

01:49.197 --> 01:51.530
All right, this is it, this
is the perfect kid. I found him.

01:51.532 --> 01:52.731
He is pretty cute.

01:52.733 --> 01:54.666
Sam, you see that?

01:54.668 --> 01:56.701
What's that, your first
mug shot, Deeks?

01:56.703 --> 01:57.802
Oh, you mean
'cause he got styled

01:57.804 --> 01:59.303
by pillow hair
and he's smirking?

01:59.305 --> 02:01.371
Actually, that does
kind of look like me.

02:01.373 --> 02:03.339
Deeks has signed up for
a mentoring program.

02:03.341 --> 02:04.740
Ah, that's
commendable.

02:04.742 --> 02:06.842
Please.
Yeah, I get to spend
every weekend with him.

02:06.844 --> 02:09.177
Yeah, you could use
the supervision.

02:09.179 --> 02:10.878
Listen to his likes:
Surfing,

02:10.880 --> 02:12.546
fish tacos--
and wait for the trifecta--

02:12.548 --> 02:15.849
the Three Stooges. And his
dislikes are rules and socks.

02:15.851 --> 02:17.584
And now I'm gonna be a role
model. I'm, like, start,

02:17.586 --> 02:19.485
you know, shaping his life.
You're gonna
shape his life?

02:19.487 --> 02:21.087
Yeah.
So he'll
be stuck in

02:21.088 --> 02:22.688
perpetual adolescence.
No, you know,
I think Deeks

02:22.690 --> 02:24.589
actually has a few things
to teach this kid.

02:24.591 --> 02:26.324
Thank you.
Really? Such as?

02:26.326 --> 02:28.326
Such as expanding
his cultural horizons.

02:28.328 --> 02:31.329
Oh, yeah, what kid wouldn't want
to play<i> Grand Theft Auto V</i>

02:31.331 --> 02:33.264
and pause reruns
of<i> Baywatch?</i>

02:33.266 --> 02:34.632
(everyone laughing)
You know what?

02:34.634 --> 02:36.433
You make fun all you want,
but I'm stoked.

02:36.435 --> 02:38.768
And in all reality,
this is like, uh,

02:38.770 --> 02:41.237
you know, it's like
a precursor to being a father.

02:41.239 --> 02:43.305
SAM: What?
Well, there's a start.

02:43.307 --> 02:45.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, guys.

02:45.242 --> 02:46.608
It's nice that
you're trying to help.

02:46.610 --> 02:48.610
But it's one thing
to talk about parenting--

02:48.612 --> 02:51.446
actual parenting
is a totally different thing.

02:51.448 --> 02:53.481
Kamran having some
cell phone problems again?

02:53.483 --> 02:56.484
You will never know how hard
it is to raise a child.

02:56.486 --> 03:00.454
What makes you think I've
ruled out that possibility?

03:00.456 --> 03:01.755
What?
Seriously?

03:01.757 --> 03:03.289
What? I'm still
young enough.

03:03.291 --> 03:04.690
Joelle and I have got
things back on track.

03:04.692 --> 03:06.324
Y-You know...
You never know.

03:06.326 --> 03:09.427
(chuckles) Little
lowercase Gs running around?

03:09.429 --> 03:11.862
Look, if you're gonna do it,
take your time, start slow.

03:11.864 --> 03:13.763
Uh-huh. How so?

03:13.765 --> 03:16.332
Get a plant.
If that lives, get a pet.

03:16.334 --> 03:18.233
One without a central
nervous system,

03:18.235 --> 03:19.567
like a jellyfish.

03:19.569 --> 03:20.634
A jellyfish?
A jellyfish.

03:20.636 --> 03:21.935
Uh, okay.

03:21.937 --> 03:23.169
(whistle blows)
ERIC: Guys.

03:23.171 --> 03:26.472
We have a case.
Let's go. Now.

03:26.474 --> 03:29.374
NELL: With 63 confirmed kills,
Gunnery Sergeant Connor Rutnam

03:29.376 --> 03:31.509
was one of the most
talented and efficient

03:31.511 --> 03:34.478
Marine Corps snipers
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.546
He retired after
his fourth tour and later

03:36.548 --> 03:39.949
began showing signs
of psychological deterioration.

03:39.951 --> 03:41.684
PTSD.

03:41.686 --> 03:43.519
He's holding
an M40A5.

03:43.521 --> 03:46.188
Used for long-range
precision fire on targets

03:46.190 --> 03:47.556
in a concealed position.

03:47.558 --> 03:49.658
Often rooftops,
targeting anything

03:49.660 --> 03:51.559
from enemy combatants
to suicide bombers.

03:51.561 --> 03:54.595
Which could include
women and children.

03:54.597 --> 03:57.230
HETTY: It became clear
that Mr. Rutnam

03:57.232 --> 03:59.265
was struggling
with adjusting

03:59.267 --> 04:00.699
to life at home.

04:00.701 --> 04:04.335
Until yesterday, he was
receiving treatment at the VA.

04:04.337 --> 04:06.837
ERIC: A nurse and an orderly
were trying to restrain him

04:06.839 --> 04:10.674
when he overpowered them
and escaped the facility.

04:10.676 --> 04:12.976
So we have a mentally unstable,
highly-skilled sniper

04:12.978 --> 04:14.811
on the loose.
With the presence

04:14.813 --> 04:17.480
of mind to steal the orderly's
uniform and badge.

04:17.482 --> 04:19.582
Which makes him
all the more dangerous.

04:20.918 --> 04:22.517
Anything specific set him off?

04:22.519 --> 04:23.551
HETTY: Not that
we could tell.

04:23.553 --> 04:25.553
Mr. Hanna, Mr. Callen,

04:25.555 --> 04:27.655
talk to the people
at the VA.

04:27.657 --> 04:30.824
See if they can shine
any light on his condition,

04:30.826 --> 04:32.525
uh, or whereabouts.

04:32.527 --> 04:35.494
Let's do it.
Okay.

04:35.496 --> 04:37.629
He also has a wife
and 15-year-old daughter

04:37.631 --> 04:39.330
living in Beverlywood.

04:39.332 --> 04:42.666
Whom you and Ms. Blye
are going to visit.

04:42.668 --> 04:45.234
Yes, ma'am.
On it.

04:47.771 --> 04:49.637
DOCTOR:
<i> He was responding well</i>

04:49.639 --> 04:51.872
to the course
of treatment:

04:51.874 --> 04:55.242
meds, counseling--
both one-on-one and group.

04:55.244 --> 04:57.244
When did he start
going south again?

04:57.246 --> 04:59.446
About two weeks ago.
Did something
trigger it?

04:59.448 --> 05:02.849
Not that we could tell.
That's the paradox.

05:02.851 --> 05:04.717
When a patient's condition
starts to worsen,

05:04.719 --> 05:07.653
the hardest thing is to
get them to talk about it.
Any person

05:07.655 --> 05:10.022
or place he wanted to see
on the outside?

05:10.024 --> 05:11.690
Not that I'm aware of.

05:11.692 --> 05:13.925
He might have said something
in his therapy sessions,

05:13.927 --> 05:16.027
but those are off the record.

05:16.029 --> 05:17.495
CALLEN:
Well, I'm sure you realize

05:17.497 --> 05:18.629
the situation
we're dealing with.

05:18.631 --> 05:19.730
I do.

05:19.732 --> 05:21.598
Connor is a trained sniper

05:21.600 --> 05:22.999
with serious emotional problems.

05:23.001 --> 05:24.800
SAM: In a city full of
easy to access guns.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.702
I don't write the rules,
gentlemen.

05:27.704 --> 05:30.838
I'm just trying to make the best
of a lot of bad situations here.

05:31.774 --> 05:33.507
We understand.

05:33.509 --> 05:34.841
You might want to speak
with Mike Takahamo.

05:34.843 --> 05:38.744
He was Connor's attending
nurse when he escaped.

05:41.682 --> 05:44.282
Sorry, I just want to
get these in the fridge.

05:44.284 --> 05:45.583
Take your time, please.

05:45.585 --> 05:46.684
Have you heard anything
from your husband

05:46.686 --> 05:48.619
since he left the VA?

05:48.621 --> 05:51.722
GIRL (in distance):
Hey, Mom! Two cars outside!
(door opens, closes)

05:51.724 --> 05:53.457
I haven't told our daughter yet.

05:53.459 --> 05:55.992
DEEKS: I'm sure it must
have been hard on you both

05:55.994 --> 05:57.593
when he was deployed.

05:57.595 --> 05:59.695
Then he comes home, and...

05:59.697 --> 06:03.465
It just didn't seem
that bad at first.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.700
I mean, he wasn't himself,

06:05.702 --> 06:08.703
like he wasn't quite here,
but that's...

06:08.705 --> 06:10.738
to be expected.

06:10.740 --> 06:13.640
But then he started
acting strange.

06:13.642 --> 06:16.909
She actually means,
like, straightjacket

06:16.911 --> 06:19.744
cray cray.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.047
Who are they?

06:24.049 --> 06:25.748
We work with your dad.

06:26.684 --> 06:28.350
Lady Marine.

06:28.352 --> 06:29.885
Must be exciting

06:29.886 --> 06:31.419
you can finally get married
in California now.

06:31.421 --> 06:32.720
Lisa!

06:32.722 --> 06:34.655
What?

06:35.591 --> 06:37.857
Pretty scruffy
for a jarhead.

06:37.859 --> 06:39.091
It's a new look.

06:39.093 --> 06:40.492
We're trying to
recruit millennials.

06:40.494 --> 06:41.893
#scruffy.

06:41.895 --> 06:44.629
Whatever.

06:44.631 --> 06:46.096
You forgot to get Diet Coke.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.700
(sighs) I apologize.

06:51.702 --> 06:52.867
KENSI:
Oh, no need to.

06:52.869 --> 06:54.869
We've all been 15 once.
Still am.

06:54.871 --> 06:56.604
She's been through
a lot recently,

06:56.606 --> 06:57.805
so we totally understand.

06:57.807 --> 07:00.107
She wasn't the easiest
to deal with

07:00.109 --> 07:01.808
<i> before</i> he went overseas,

07:01.810 --> 07:03.576
and things just got worse

07:03.578 --> 07:05.110
when Connor got sick.

07:05.112 --> 07:07.445
Just attitude...

07:07.447 --> 07:08.879
staying out late and...

07:08.881 --> 07:11.815
You know, I can tell
that she's upset,

07:11.817 --> 07:13.817
but she doesn't want
to talk about it.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.388
The last time that we went
to visit him in the hospital

07:19.390 --> 07:21.690
and she could see
he was getting better,

07:21.692 --> 07:23.758
he hugged her.

07:26.062 --> 07:29.796
I don't think I'd seen her cry
since she was ten.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.766
Well, he's only been
gone a few hours,

07:33.768 --> 07:35.768
and we are using all of our
resources to find him.

07:35.770 --> 07:36.869
Absolutely,

07:36.870 --> 07:37.969
and please,
if he contacts you,

07:37.972 --> 07:39.771
let us know.

07:39.773 --> 07:42.807
Uh, we also need
Connor's computer.

07:43.743 --> 07:45.609
I'll go get it.

07:45.611 --> 07:47.777
Thank you.

07:49.747 --> 07:51.813
This was his room.

07:53.082 --> 07:54.948
This is where he attacked you
and the orderly?

07:54.950 --> 07:57.383
That's right.
You want to talk us through it?

07:57.385 --> 07:59.752
I wrote it all in my report.

07:59.754 --> 08:01.920
You mind
saving us a read?

08:01.922 --> 08:03.888
The Cliff Notes will be fine.

08:03.890 --> 08:07.458
Patient showed signs
of confusion and hostility.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.926
We attempted to restrain

08:08.928 --> 08:10.560
and sedate him.

08:10.562 --> 08:11.894
Patient physically attacked
the orderly

08:11.896 --> 08:13.695
and myself... end of story.

08:13.697 --> 08:15.380
Now, if you'll excuse me...

08:15.381 --> 08:17.064
Actually, we have
a few more questions.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.800
I told you
everything I know.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.601
What more
do you want from me?

08:20.603 --> 08:22.836
You know, a better attitude,
concern for a missing patient,

08:22.838 --> 08:24.904
that would be a good start.

08:24.906 --> 08:26.572
Yeah, well, I am concerned.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.006
Just as I am
for the other patients

08:28.008 --> 08:29.974
that still that need attending.

08:31.578 --> 08:32.944
Okay?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.246
Okay.

08:39.851 --> 08:41.934
Wow.

08:41.935 --> 08:44.018
Somebody woke up on the
wrong side of the gurney.

08:44.021 --> 08:47.288
Stressful job.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.857
I'm sensing something
more than stress.

08:49.859 --> 08:50.791
Insightful.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.225
Maybe we ought

08:52.227 --> 08:53.626
to put you to work here.

08:53.628 --> 08:55.628
Already am.
Maybe you should do the same.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.596
Uh-huh.

09:10.844 --> 09:12.009
G.

09:18.951 --> 09:21.851
I think maybe we keep these
under the mattress for now.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.819
NELL:
<i> So the e-mails</i>

09:23.821 --> 09:25.620
we pulled
off Connor's computer

09:25.622 --> 09:27.622
don't point to anyone
in particular he'd run to.

09:27.624 --> 09:28.723
DEEKS: What about
his browsing history?

09:28.725 --> 09:31.025
Yes, there is a Web site

09:31.027 --> 09:32.960
he paid numerous visits to.

09:32.962 --> 09:35.595
He watched this video

09:35.597 --> 09:37.964
a dozen times
before entering the hospital.

09:37.966 --> 09:40.066
(gunfire, people screaming)
KELSEY: 1966. Charles Whitman.

09:40.068 --> 09:42.902
A former
Marine Corps sharpshooter.

09:42.904 --> 09:44.069
Barricaded himself

09:44.071 --> 09:45.637
on the 28th floor
observation deck

09:45.639 --> 09:46.871
of the University
of Texas Tower

09:46.873 --> 09:50.307
with his Remington
700 Deer Rifle.

09:50.309 --> 09:52.575
(sighs)

09:52.577 --> 09:54.143
Wounded 26 students.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.113
Killed 15.

10:09.826 --> 10:12.059
NELL: We just discovered
an out-of-service traffic cam

10:12.061 --> 10:14.361
on Nordhoff.

10:14.362 --> 10:16.662
Now, the lens is cracked
and the view is limited.
Making it

10:16.665 --> 10:18.631
unsuitable for the courts
but helpful to us.

10:18.633 --> 10:22.701
Right. This is 15 minutes
after Connor Rutnam

10:22.703 --> 10:24.869
attacked the nurse
and orderly.

10:30.676 --> 10:32.709
SAM:
Someone knew his plan.

10:32.711 --> 10:35.044
Can you zoom in any closer
on that car?

10:35.046 --> 10:36.178
We tried-- it doesn't help.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.047
ERIC:
We can only make out that it's

10:39.049 --> 10:41.716
a Toyota Camry,
mid-2000's most likely.

10:41.718 --> 10:43.317
What about that homeless guy?

10:43.319 --> 10:45.686
Mm, I'd say his cart's
an Albertson's,

10:45.688 --> 10:47.854
possibly late-model Safeway.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.723
He'll be here all week, folks.

10:50.725 --> 10:52.124
ERIC:
He seems to be

10:52.126 --> 10:53.792
a regular on
that street.

10:53.794 --> 10:55.627
This is the last
four days.

10:55.629 --> 10:58.062
It's a long shot
he's gonna be able

10:58.064 --> 11:00.481
to give us anything.

11:00.482 --> 11:02.899
His field of vision
is wider than that camera.
I don't know

11:02.902 --> 11:04.268
how focused<i> his</i> lens is.

11:04.269 --> 11:05.635
That cart looks like
a BevMo! checkout.

11:05.638 --> 11:07.404
ERIC: The car
was waiting there

11:07.406 --> 11:10.306
a good ten, 15 minutes--
maybe he saw the driver.

11:10.308 --> 11:12.074
Well, it's worth a shot.

11:12.076 --> 11:13.275
Thanks.

11:14.678 --> 11:18.246
I understand there's
been a turn of events

11:18.248 --> 11:20.314
in the Connor
Rutnam case.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.750
Indeed there has.

11:23.752 --> 11:25.752
Mr. Callen and Mr. Hanna

11:25.754 --> 11:28.755
found a baggie
of unidentified pills

11:28.757 --> 11:30.256
under his mattress.

11:30.258 --> 11:32.358
It's being analyzed
right now.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.195
Well, I doubt the VA's
dispensing meds in plastic bags.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.731
Do you think
this could be the cause

11:39.733 --> 11:42.100
of Rutnam's latest troubles?
It's possible.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.369
The question is,
who gave them to him?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.237
Visitor?

11:47.239 --> 11:48.938
Member of the staff?

11:48.940 --> 11:51.707
I don't have to remind you of
the tenuous political situation

11:51.709 --> 11:54.176
at the VA right now.

11:54.178 --> 11:56.812
Actually,

11:56.813 --> 11:59.447
I was thinking that we
could use that to our advantage.

11:59.449 --> 12:01.048
It would be

12:01.050 --> 12:04.851
unlikely to arouse any suspicion

12:04.853 --> 12:09.989
if they received a visit from
an oversight compliance officer.

12:09.991 --> 12:14.026
Who would naturally be granted
access to all files and staff.

12:14.028 --> 12:18.063
I think Mr. Deeks cleans up
rather well, don't you?

12:18.065 --> 12:20.165
Depends on one's standards,
I suppose,

12:20.167 --> 12:22.167
but I get where you're going.

12:23.837 --> 12:25.870
What about on the visitor side?

12:25.872 --> 12:27.838
Ms. Blye's sniper background

12:27.840 --> 12:30.740
should make
for a very believable patient.

12:30.742 --> 12:33.409
That's what concerns me.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.847
We're a long way
from Afghanistan, Owen.

12:43.219 --> 12:45.252
I hope so.

12:47.889 --> 12:50.089
MAN (on TV):
In 1988, physicist Bob Lazar

12:50.091 --> 12:53.158
told friends
he'd seen flying saucers

12:53.160 --> 12:55.994
when he was working
on a top secret project
(coughs)

12:55.996 --> 12:58.363
at Area 51.

12:58.365 --> 12:59.897
Hey.

12:59.899 --> 13:00.931
Hey.

13:00.933 --> 13:02.365
You just get here?

13:02.367 --> 13:03.933
Yeah.

13:05.169 --> 13:06.168
What branch?

13:06.170 --> 13:07.369
Marines. You?

13:07.371 --> 13:08.903
Rangers.

13:08.905 --> 13:11.772
Don't hold it
against me.
(chuckles)

13:11.774 --> 13:13.874
(TV show continues indistinctly)

13:13.876 --> 13:15.208
So how you doing?

13:16.177 --> 13:18.810
Living the dream, obviously.

13:18.812 --> 13:20.244
Mm.

13:23.849 --> 13:25.915
You looking for someone?

13:25.917 --> 13:28.918
Yeah. A guy I served with,
I heard he, uh...

13:28.920 --> 13:30.786
he was here.
Oh. What's his name?

13:30.788 --> 13:32.020
Rutnam.

13:32.022 --> 13:33.821
Connor Rutnam.
You know him?
Yeah.

13:33.823 --> 13:34.855
He's not here anymore.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.323
Got released?

13:36.325 --> 13:38.892
No. He went AWOL yesterday.

13:38.894 --> 13:40.894
Are you serious?

13:42.497 --> 13:44.129
Where'd he go?

13:44.131 --> 13:45.864
No idea.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.498
You a sniper

13:47.500 --> 13:48.866
like him?

13:48.868 --> 13:50.934
Female Engagement Team, yeah.

13:50.936 --> 13:54.037
Connor used to talk about it.

13:54.039 --> 13:57.106
Killing somebody
from a distance...

13:57.108 --> 14:00.008
didn't feel real.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.343
Until... it did.

14:02.345 --> 14:04.111
Is that why<i> you're</i> here?

14:06.815 --> 14:09.182
I don't really want
to talk about it.

14:09.184 --> 14:11.217
Sorry.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.353
Wonder why Connor left
like that, huh?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.321
I don't know.
He was doing fine,

14:17.323 --> 14:18.955
then he
just started losing it

14:18.957 --> 14:20.222
over the past few weeks.

14:20.224 --> 14:21.389
Huh.

14:21.391 --> 14:22.823
PTSD.

14:22.825 --> 14:24.825
Think he told anybody
where he was going?

14:24.827 --> 14:26.893
I don't know--
he had a couple of visitors.

14:26.895 --> 14:29.795
And there was this one guy
he spent a lot of time with.

14:29.797 --> 14:32.297
Well, you should tell
the staff his name.
I...

14:32.299 --> 14:33.965
have no idea what it was.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.399
(man clears throat in distance)

14:38.237 --> 14:39.301
Nice talking to you.

14:42.806 --> 14:43.871
Oh, my G...

14:44.807 --> 14:45.906
Sorry, sorry.

14:47.442 --> 14:48.908
(quietly):
Connor had several visitors.

14:48.910 --> 14:49.842
He was tight with one.

14:49.844 --> 14:51.009
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

14:51.011 --> 14:52.844
(sighs)
Sorry.

14:52.846 --> 14:54.212
No, it's fine.

14:54.214 --> 14:56.847
DR. RIVERS:<i> We had</i>
<i> a compliance meeting here</i>

14:56.849 --> 14:58.081
three weeks ago.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.282
Everything checked out.

14:59.284 --> 15:00.983
Checked out?

15:00.985 --> 15:02.951
So you would consider the escape

15:02.953 --> 15:05.420
of a disturbed
and dangerous patient

15:05.422 --> 15:07.021
as business as usual?

15:07.023 --> 15:08.922
'Cause I would argue,
Dr. Rivers,

15:08.924 --> 15:10.523
the only thing
"checked out" here

15:10.525 --> 15:12.157
is your staff,

15:12.159 --> 15:14.225
who I will now be
thoroughly "checking out."

15:14.227 --> 15:16.860
We have nothing to hide here,
Mr. Rogers.

15:16.862 --> 15:19.329
You will have complete
and unfettered access

15:19.331 --> 15:21.998
to anyone you wish
to speak with.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.532
I'm also gonna need files
and records on everybody.

15:23.534 --> 15:24.900
Fine.

15:24.902 --> 15:26.434
I'll have all passwords
and authorizations

15:26.436 --> 15:27.935
made available to you.

15:27.937 --> 15:31.471
I'm sorry,
is there a problem, Doctor?

15:31.473 --> 15:33.105
You know what my problem is,
Mr. Rogers?

15:33.107 --> 15:35.440
No, but I instinctually feel
like you're going to tell me.

15:35.442 --> 15:37.875
100 patients
with mood disorders,

15:37.877 --> 15:39.460
post-traumatic stress
disorders,

15:39.461 --> 15:41.044
substance abuse disorders,
bipolar disorders,

15:41.046 --> 15:42.345
to name but a few.

15:42.347 --> 15:43.512
Not enough time,

15:43.514 --> 15:44.980
not enough money,
not enough beds,

15:44.982 --> 15:46.614
not enough staff,
and now, you.

15:46.616 --> 15:50.017
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I'm just trying to do my job.

15:50.019 --> 15:52.385
Yes, you are.

15:55.390 --> 15:58.057
I'm also gonna need
the visitors log.

16:00.061 --> 16:02.895
Lots of people are in love
with the idea of having kids,

16:02.897 --> 16:05.264
but most have no idea what
they're getting into.

16:05.266 --> 16:06.331
Did you and Michelle?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.632
I mean,
we thought we did.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.600
Read books,
we took classes...

16:09.602 --> 16:11.202
That help?

16:11.204 --> 16:13.604
Hell, no.
(laughs)

16:13.606 --> 16:14.671
(Sam laughs)

16:15.607 --> 16:17.373
How you doing?

16:17.375 --> 16:19.074
Excuse me.

16:19.076 --> 16:21.709
Just want to ask you
some questions.

16:25.147 --> 16:27.713
I'm gonna guess Desert Storm.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.116
Enduring Freedom for me.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.720
We're looking for another vet.

16:36.722 --> 16:38.188
Took off from the hospital
this morning.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.255
He bumped your cart.

16:39.257 --> 16:42.591
He might be in danger.

16:42.593 --> 16:44.559
Got into a car right over there.

16:49.999 --> 16:52.632
Gray Camry, '93.

16:52.634 --> 16:55.301
Paint on the hood oxidized.

16:55.303 --> 16:58.103
White scratches on
the right front bumper,

16:58.105 --> 17:01.072
probably hit a wall.

17:01.074 --> 17:04.041
Replacement tires,

17:04.043 --> 17:06.343
Michelin knockoffs.

17:06.345 --> 17:07.711
You a mechanic?

17:07.713 --> 17:09.713
Six years.

17:09.715 --> 17:11.347
12th Engineer Battalion.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.283
Didn't happen
to get a plate, did you?

17:16.053 --> 17:17.752
Three, Delta,

17:17.754 --> 17:20.187
Hotel, India...

17:23.192 --> 17:24.391
(groans)

17:24.393 --> 17:25.658
You're doing great.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.493
SAM:
What about the driver?

17:27.495 --> 17:29.194
You see the driver?

17:29.196 --> 17:31.095
Asian guy,

17:31.097 --> 17:33.564
like Pakistani or Indian.

17:33.566 --> 17:36.366
30, maybe.

17:38.703 --> 17:41.136
Look, I got to go.

17:41.138 --> 17:43.204
Appreciate it.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.141
Hey, hey, hey.

17:48.143 --> 17:50.042
One sec, one sec, one sec.

17:50.044 --> 17:52.110
What the hell
are you doing out here?

17:54.114 --> 17:56.214
You don't trust them,
is that it?

17:57.150 --> 17:59.817
What do you think?

18:01.253 --> 18:03.219
They screwed up.

18:03.221 --> 18:05.487
It's not all bad.

18:05.489 --> 18:07.121
They helped me when I got back.

18:11.093 --> 18:13.359
You got skills, man.

18:13.361 --> 18:15.561
Any shop around here

18:15.563 --> 18:17.629
would be lucky to have you.

18:17.631 --> 18:20.398
You just got to get
your act together.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.570
It's your choice.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.651
You all right?

18:43.121 --> 18:46.188
We send guys to war,
expect them to step up.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.756
Then when they come
back all broken,

18:47.758 --> 18:50.325
we step away.

19:09.445 --> 19:12.112
Sorry to interrupt,
Dr. Rivers.

19:12.114 --> 19:14.180
Trouble in the neighborhood,
Mr. Rogers?

19:14.182 --> 19:16.115
Who has access to the meds,
the controlled pharmaceuticals?

19:16.117 --> 19:17.749
Myself.

19:17.751 --> 19:19.851
All of the doctors,
some of the nurses.

19:21.254 --> 19:22.686
Nurse Takahamo?

19:22.688 --> 19:24.554
He does.

19:26.324 --> 19:29.325
Nurse Takahamo...?

19:29.327 --> 19:31.427
Nurse, no!

19:42.138 --> 19:43.203
(indistinct conversation)

19:43.205 --> 19:44.370
DEEKS:
Hey!

19:46.374 --> 19:49.241
NCIS.

19:49.243 --> 19:50.508
(panting)

19:50.510 --> 19:51.642
The game is up.

19:52.578 --> 19:54.511
And just for the record,

19:54.513 --> 19:57.247
next time, never run.

20:08.526 --> 20:10.192
DEEKS:
Why'd you run?

20:10.194 --> 20:11.693
I like to keep in shape.

20:11.695 --> 20:13.327
Well, every federal prison
has a running track.

20:13.329 --> 20:15.029
I'm sure you'll utilize that.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.730
We found unauthorized pills
in Connor Rutnam's bed.

20:16.732 --> 20:19.332
We also found
inventory discrepancies

20:19.334 --> 20:20.499
with the meds
in lockup.

20:20.501 --> 20:22.501
Meds that you had access to.

20:22.503 --> 20:23.835
Lots of people have access.

20:23.837 --> 20:25.426
DEEKS: You're absolutely
right, which is why

20:25.427 --> 20:27.016
we looked at every
single discrepancy

20:27.017 --> 20:28.606
to figure out which doctors
and nurses were working.

20:28.608 --> 20:31.208
You were working
every single time.

20:31.210 --> 20:33.843
You are the common denominator.

20:35.580 --> 20:37.446
What did you find under his bed?

20:37.448 --> 20:39.481
Is this how you want to play it?

20:39.483 --> 20:41.349
You going to search my place?

20:41.351 --> 20:42.550
No, we're gonna use
the honor system.

20:42.552 --> 20:43.517
DEEKS:
You know Connor Rutnam

20:43.519 --> 20:44.818
was a sniper.

20:44.820 --> 20:47.253
You know he was one of
the best in the service.

20:47.255 --> 20:48.487
Anyone he decides
to put in his sights,

20:48.489 --> 20:50.188
you're gonna be
accessory to murder.

20:52.425 --> 20:55.659
I didn't give Rutnam
any unauthorized meds.

20:55.661 --> 20:56.960
So those pills
from the lockup,

20:56.962 --> 20:58.227
they just magically evaporated?

20:59.897 --> 21:01.897
No. I...

21:01.899 --> 21:04.332
I took them.
KENSI: Wow.

21:04.334 --> 21:06.233
Now we're just moving
around in circles.

21:06.235 --> 21:07.734
I took them to sell,
but not to patients.

21:07.736 --> 21:09.335
There'd be no point.

21:09.337 --> 21:11.870
Half of them are already
getting oxy for free.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.938
Besides, the patients
aren't allowed to have cash.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.957
So what you're saying is that

21:15.958 --> 21:17.975
you were dealing the pills
you lifted on the street?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.676
I'm being honest here.

21:19.678 --> 21:20.810
That's gotta count
for something.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.095
You're being
honest because

21:22.096 --> 21:23.379
your ass is being
nailed to the wall.

21:23.381 --> 21:24.380
DEEKS:
So explain to me
how the pills

21:24.382 --> 21:25.514
got underneath the mattress?

21:25.516 --> 21:27.549
Anyone could have
brought them in.

21:27.551 --> 21:29.484
We don't search visitors.

21:29.486 --> 21:30.485
KENSI:
Well, Connor had several.

21:30.486 --> 21:31.485
There was one in particular

21:31.488 --> 21:32.487
that he spent more time with.

21:32.489 --> 21:33.554
Do you remember?

21:37.959 --> 21:39.758
Yeah.

21:40.861 --> 21:44.696
He started coming by
the past few weeks.

21:44.698 --> 21:46.497
Connor started
sliding soon after.

21:46.499 --> 21:47.865
You got a name?

21:49.001 --> 21:50.266
Mark.

21:50.868 --> 21:52.667
Mark Simmons.

21:54.570 --> 21:56.937
This is former
Army Corporal Mark Simmons.

21:56.939 --> 21:59.005
He visited Connor Rutnam
at the VA

21:59.007 --> 22:01.640
four times
over the past three weeks.

22:01.642 --> 22:02.807
Did they cross paths
in-country?

22:02.809 --> 22:04.275
Mmm, briefly,
in Afghanistan.

22:04.277 --> 22:06.243
But records don't show
any contact with Connor

22:06.245 --> 22:07.410
until the VA visits.

22:07.412 --> 22:10.012
But they do show a
little something else.

22:10.014 --> 22:11.847
(clears throat)

22:11.849 --> 22:14.282
ERIC: Simmons was discharged
six months ago.

22:14.284 --> 22:16.751
And shortly after,
he joined the PFA--

22:16.753 --> 22:18.385
Protectors of a Free America.

22:18.387 --> 22:21.888
It was founded by
Fred Kington, 1987.

22:22.957 --> 22:24.289
A right-wing extremist
organization.

22:24.291 --> 22:26.424
Hiding behind the flag.

22:26.426 --> 22:28.259
They want to round up
every Muslim

22:28.261 --> 22:29.593
and ship them out of the U.S.

22:29.595 --> 22:31.494
Someone with Connor's skills,

22:31.496 --> 22:34.363
be valuable to those guys
in the worst way.

22:34.365 --> 22:35.931
KENSI: Especially if he's
pumped up with drugs

22:35.933 --> 22:38.266
that make it easier to
control and manipulate him.

22:38.268 --> 22:39.967
That would be scopolamine.
Lab results came back

22:39.969 --> 22:41.802
from the pills you found
under the mattress.

22:41.804 --> 22:44.805
Interrogation med.
NELL:
It's also known as
the "zombie drug."

22:44.807 --> 22:47.607
Feed enough of it to someone
and you own them.

22:47.609 --> 22:49.875
Well, Takahamo wasn't lying.

22:49.877 --> 22:51.627
There's no street market
for that.

22:51.628 --> 22:53.378
ERIC:
Now, we tracked the
car Connor got into

22:53.380 --> 22:55.012
from the description
and the partial plate

22:55.014 --> 22:57.314
the homeless man gave you.

22:57.316 --> 22:59.015
NELL: It's registered
to a Vamsi Patel.

22:59.017 --> 23:01.784
He's a driver for the
"Let's Cruise" car service.

23:01.786 --> 23:05.354
Oddly enough, Connor's pickup
wasn't on the company manifest.

23:05.356 --> 23:06.455
But...

23:06.457 --> 23:07.989
Mark Simmons' pickup was,

23:07.991 --> 23:10.324
just an hour before
Connor was picked up.

23:10.326 --> 23:12.793
So the question is:
where's the next pickup?

23:13.729 --> 23:14.928
Checking...

23:16.998 --> 23:18.597
KENSI:
Mr. Patel.

23:18.599 --> 23:20.799
Bambi!

23:20.801 --> 23:21.933
What?

23:21.935 --> 23:22.934
And you must be DJ Kimchee.

23:22.936 --> 23:24.652
I got your text, man.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.369
I've heard your mixes,
I'm a huge fan.

23:26.372 --> 23:27.637
All right, check this out:

23:27.639 --> 23:29.539
Your bachelor party
is going to crush.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.707
Wow!
Spider Woman theme.

23:31.709 --> 23:32.974
Brilliant.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.076
I'm not a stripper, man.
Oh, no, no, no.

23:35.078 --> 23:36.677
Of course not. It's 2015.

23:36.679 --> 23:38.879
You, beautiful lady,
are a burlesque entertainer.

23:38.881 --> 23:41.147
Empowerment, sister.
I am woman,

23:41.149 --> 23:43.115
hear me roar,
everything Beyoncé talked--

23:43.117 --> 23:45.150
Okay, not a problem.

23:45.152 --> 23:47.018
You want to go with a little
sexy cop kind of thing,

23:47.020 --> 23:48.536
I can work with that.

23:48.537 --> 23:50.053
I think I just have
to go with...
Okay, listen, I need you

23:50.056 --> 23:51.088
to take a chill pill,
all right?

23:51.089 --> 23:52.121
Why don't you just take,
like, ten chill pills?

23:52.124 --> 23:54.491
We're actual
Federal agents.

23:54.493 --> 23:55.525
Wait, for reals?

23:55.527 --> 23:56.726
Oh, for reals, reals.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.794
You want to hire my ride
for undercover?

23:58.796 --> 24:00.796
Law enforcement
discount may be

24:00.798 --> 24:01.530
quite a lot...
Ehp, ehp, ehp...

24:01.532 --> 24:03.431
What?

24:03.433 --> 24:04.899
We realize this is
out of your territory,

24:04.901 --> 24:07.601
but we really need you listen
right now.

24:07.603 --> 24:09.202
You made a pickup
yesterday at the VA.

24:09.204 --> 24:10.703
An unauthorized pickup.

24:10.705 --> 24:11.704
Unauthorized?

24:11.706 --> 24:12.705
No, I was going to put down...

24:12.707 --> 24:15.207
Uhp, uhp, uhp, uhp, uhp...!

24:15.209 --> 24:17.042
Prior to that,
you picked up Mark Simmons.

24:17.044 --> 24:18.510
That was<i> on</i> the books.

24:18.512 --> 24:20.512
Two questions:

24:20.514 --> 24:21.579
First, are those two connected?

24:23.149 --> 24:25.516
Now you can speak... briefly.

24:25.518 --> 24:27.201
Okay, uh...

24:27.202 --> 24:28.885
Simmons paid me 100 bucks
to get his friend.

24:28.888 --> 24:31.622
He said this guy
did not have an account.

24:31.624 --> 24:32.522
Second question:
where'd you take him?

24:32.524 --> 24:34.190
Uh, the Valley.

24:34.192 --> 24:35.724
Uh, Chandler and Colfax.

24:37.194 --> 24:38.726
That's where the Protectors
of a Free America

24:38.728 --> 24:39.727
headquarters are located.

24:39.729 --> 24:40.761
I'm gonna call Callen.

24:40.763 --> 24:42.796
Look.
Ooh, look at this!

24:42.798 --> 24:44.130
You like that?

24:44.132 --> 24:45.197
It's a good color.

24:45.199 --> 24:46.464
How much?

24:46.466 --> 24:48.232
Well, for you, uh,

24:48.234 --> 24:50.467
15% good cop discount.

24:50.469 --> 24:51.968
Okay?

24:51.970 --> 24:53.169
What is happening?
DEEKS:
You heard the man.

24:53.171 --> 24:54.637
I get a 15% off...

24:54.639 --> 24:55.855
BOTH:
...good cop discount.

24:55.856 --> 24:57.072
DEEKS: This thing is vintage.
You can't find these online.

24:57.074 --> 24:58.640
You know who's
gonna love it?

24:58.642 --> 25:00.708
My little brother.

25:08.517 --> 25:11.584
What can I do you for, fellas?

25:15.523 --> 25:18.490
Connor Rutnam.
MAN:
Afraid I don't know

25:18.492 --> 25:20.024
who that is.
CALLEN:
What about Mark Simmons?

25:20.026 --> 25:22.092
Ah, you just
missed him.

25:22.094 --> 25:23.493
Mm-hmm.
Just missed him.

25:23.495 --> 25:25.228
Where'd he go?
Well, let's see...

25:25.230 --> 25:28.097
I think it was
the Latino Caucus.

25:28.099 --> 25:29.765
Ah, hell,

25:29.767 --> 25:30.799
what am I thinking?

25:30.801 --> 25:31.800
Today's Thursday--
he volunteers

25:31.802 --> 25:33.535
at the Gay and
Lesbian Center.

25:33.537 --> 25:35.837
Oh, he's just getting in a few
hate crimes before dinner?

25:35.839 --> 25:37.271
Well, you know what they say:

25:37.273 --> 25:39.172
one man's hate crime
is another man's justice.

25:39.174 --> 25:41.274
Is that what they say?

25:41.276 --> 25:44.243
You think that badge puts
a white hat on your heads?

25:44.245 --> 25:45.811
You're as much the enemy

25:45.813 --> 25:48.213
as Al Qaeda,
far as we're concerned.

25:48.215 --> 25:50.281
Your "enemy" is trying to save
a decorated war veteran.

25:50.283 --> 25:52.149
SAM: Or do you
consider a Marine

25:52.151 --> 25:54.517
who tries to save your sorry ass
the enemy, too?

25:57.188 --> 25:59.521
MAN: It's been real nice
chattin' with you.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.623
Where's your fearless leader,
Fred Kington?

26:02.625 --> 26:04.224
Not here.

26:04.226 --> 26:06.859
Is he helping some
hardworking immigrants

26:06.861 --> 26:09.695
fill out their green card
applications?

26:09.697 --> 26:11.596
That would be
<i> illegal</i> immigrants,

26:11.598 --> 26:13.030
technically speaking.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.867
Islam is the false religion
of the 21st century!

26:17.869 --> 26:19.101
Islam causes poverty!

26:19.103 --> 26:22.037
Islam pollutes
the honor of women!

26:22.039 --> 26:24.305
Islam destroys lives!

26:24.307 --> 26:27.308
Islam has got to go!
Islam has got to go!

26:27.310 --> 26:29.076
(gunshot)

26:29.078 --> 26:31.144
(people screaming)

26:31.146 --> 26:32.211
Federal agents!
Federal agents!

26:33.914 --> 26:35.146
Federal agent.

26:35.148 --> 26:36.147
OFFICER: LAPD!
We got shots fired...

26:36.149 --> 26:37.915
(people shouting in panic)

26:37.917 --> 26:40.550
We need immediate backup!
Repeat: immediate backup!

26:40.552 --> 26:42.285
Shot came from
across the street.

26:42.287 --> 26:43.853
SAM:
It's a sniper shot.

26:43.855 --> 26:45.588
The roof!

26:51.729 --> 26:53.695
CALLEN:
Good.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.132
Federal agent!

27:25.926 --> 27:28.226
Fred Kington's in custody,
on his way to the boatshed.

27:28.228 --> 27:29.927
DEEKS:
Guys in the SUV?

27:29.929 --> 27:31.361
Didn't get a look
at their faces.

27:31.363 --> 27:33.129
And from their builds,
it's possible one of them

27:33.131 --> 27:34.930
could have been Connor.

27:34.932 --> 27:36.898
SAM:
Driver from the car service

27:36.900 --> 27:38.199
give you anything?

27:38.201 --> 27:39.934
He said Connor didn't say
a word the whole trip.

27:39.936 --> 27:40.935
Seemed zoned out.

27:40.937 --> 27:42.102
That's the scopolamine.

27:42.104 --> 27:43.303
KENSI:
Yeah.

27:43.305 --> 27:44.837
The shooter was up here,
all right.

27:44.839 --> 27:46.004
See that disturbance in the dust

27:46.006 --> 27:47.305
right there, on the ledge?

27:47.307 --> 27:49.740
That would have been
the shooter's elbow.

27:49.742 --> 27:51.174
Right here, these two marks--

27:51.176 --> 27:54.143
that would have been
his front foot

27:54.145 --> 27:56.278
and the second mark
would've been his knee.

27:58.148 --> 28:01.015
Which means the shooter's
left-handed.

28:01.017 --> 28:02.116
In the photos
we saw in Ops,

28:02.118 --> 28:03.217
Connor was shooting
right-handed.

28:03.219 --> 28:04.218
Exactly.

28:04.220 --> 28:07.254
So who took the shot?

28:07.256 --> 28:09.389
And why do they need Connor?

28:21.202 --> 28:22.868
Mr. Kington.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.205
For the record,

28:27.207 --> 28:31.008
my group does not advocate
killing Muslims here in America,

28:31.010 --> 28:34.244
unless, of course,
they are confirmed terrorists.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.411
Well, just for the record,

28:35.413 --> 28:37.279
your manifesto proposes

28:37.281 --> 28:40.415
the eradication of all
Muslim presence on U.S. soil.

28:40.417 --> 28:42.250
Yes, by deporting them
back to their homelands

28:42.252 --> 28:45.286
where they can practice
Sharia law all they want

28:45.288 --> 28:47.288
and leave us in peace.

28:47.290 --> 28:50.257
99.9% of them
do leave us in peace.

28:50.259 --> 28:52.225
You keep telling yourself that,

28:52.227 --> 28:54.827
you're gonna be responsible
for every tragedy

28:54.829 --> 28:56.428
that comes down
in the name of Allah.

28:57.397 --> 28:59.230
You know,
Thomas Jefferson himself

28:59.232 --> 29:03.067
preached a policy
of isolationism.

29:03.069 --> 29:04.735
We keep sticking our nose
in everybody else's business,

29:04.737 --> 29:06.136
this is what happens.

29:06.138 --> 29:07.237
CALLEN:
But since you can't
force the government

29:07.239 --> 29:08.972
to adopt your deportation plan,

29:08.974 --> 29:10.306
why not pop a few

29:10.308 --> 29:12.308
outside their places
of worship, huh?

29:12.310 --> 29:13.976
Give them the idea
that maybe moving here

29:13.978 --> 29:16.211
wasn't such a great idea.
Mm-hmm.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.780
And why would I have
someone assassinated

29:18.782 --> 29:20.314
at the very place
we're protesting?

29:20.316 --> 29:21.381
It's a hell of an alibi.

29:21.383 --> 29:22.899
CALLEN:
You, on the ground

29:22.900 --> 29:24.416
with your hands clean...
minions doing

29:24.419 --> 29:26.819
your dirty work
from a rooftop.

29:28.956 --> 29:32.023
I didn't see Mark Simmons
on your protest line.

29:32.025 --> 29:34.291
I haven't seen
Mark Simmons in days.

29:34.293 --> 29:36.126
But I do know one thing:

29:36.128 --> 29:37.794
he's a true patriot.

29:37.796 --> 29:39.395
Well, your "true patriot"
is messing up

29:39.397 --> 29:41.897
Connor Rutnam's head
with scopolamine.

29:41.899 --> 29:43.999
Making him susceptible
to someone's influence.

29:44.001 --> 29:47.302
Say, the leader of
an extremist group

29:47.304 --> 29:48.803
that could use
his sniper skills

29:48.805 --> 29:50.271
to kill innocent Muslims.

29:50.273 --> 29:53.207
I've never heard of
Connor Rutnam.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.375
And by the way,

29:55.377 --> 29:59.212
there's no such thing
as an "innocent" Muslim.

30:02.016 --> 30:03.348
We confirmed Mark Simmons
is left-handed.

30:03.350 --> 30:05.216
Though he doesn't have
any sniper training,

30:05.218 --> 30:06.884
he did earn a marksman
qualification

30:06.886 --> 30:08.986
during his time
in the Army.

30:08.988 --> 30:10.320
We got an address?

30:10.322 --> 30:12.255
We do, but I don't think
you'll find him there.

30:12.257 --> 30:14.390
From what we gleaned
from his records,

30:14.392 --> 30:16.709
Simmons drives a PFA van.

30:16.710 --> 30:19.027
The traffic camera shows him
pulling into this parking lot

30:19.029 --> 30:20.995
on 6th Street,
downtown today.

30:20.997 --> 30:22.129
He's still there.

30:22.131 --> 30:23.797
What time did he enter the lot?

30:23.799 --> 30:26.099
An hour ago.
DEEKS: That gives him
plenty of time

30:26.101 --> 30:28.367
to take the shot at the mosque
and get down there.
I'll call Callen and Sam.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.434
DEEKS: Good work.
NELL: Thanks.

30:33.473 --> 30:34.738
We got eyes on the van.

30:36.108 --> 30:37.474
KENSI (over radio):
All right.

30:38.844 --> 30:40.443
DEEKS (over radio):
Now so do we.

30:40.445 --> 30:42.211
CALLEN: It's the white one,
right there.
KENSI: Yep, got it.

30:42.213 --> 30:43.979
DEEKS:
Any sign of Simmons?

30:43.981 --> 30:45.347
Not yet.

30:45.349 --> 30:46.782
DEEKS: Listen, if we're gonna
be here a while,

30:46.783 --> 30:48.216
there's a great little taco
stand around the corner.

30:48.218 --> 30:49.417
SAM: It's a stakeout,
not a picnic, Deeks.

30:49.419 --> 30:51.252
DAD:
Come on, guys...

30:51.254 --> 30:53.287
BOY: Can we just go by 7-Eleven
and get some?
No!

30:53.289 --> 30:55.255
Look at that cute
little family.

30:55.257 --> 30:57.457
So, are Lori and Steve
gonna be there?
Stop it.

30:57.459 --> 30:59.392
Mom, make him stop.

30:59.394 --> 31:00.926
BOY (mimicking):
Mom, make him stop.

31:00.928 --> 31:02.360
Why aren't the parents
doing something?

31:02.362 --> 31:04.295
They are doing something--
they're ignoring them.

31:04.297 --> 31:05.963
You know, sometimes you
got to roll with it.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.130
She hit me, Mom!

31:07.132 --> 31:08.565
Th-They're hitting each other.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.466
Seems like pretty lax
parenting to me.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.501
I'm not here to judge.
SAM: I have a theory.

31:12.503 --> 31:13.902
Oh, yeah? Let's hear it.

31:13.904 --> 31:15.503
It's called
exhaustion.
Mm-hmm.

31:15.505 --> 31:17.371
CALLEN: You so
sure about that?

31:17.373 --> 31:19.262
SAM: Yeah, I'm
so sure about that.

31:19.263 --> 31:21.152
I'll tell you what,
we'll revisit the subject

31:21.153 --> 31:23.042
in a few years when all of you
have a couple of kids each.

31:23.045 --> 31:24.711
Mm-hmm.

31:24.712 --> 31:26.378
That's if you haven't put them
up for adoption already.

31:26.381 --> 31:27.613
(chuckles)

31:28.549 --> 31:30.215
KENSI:
Head's up, guys.

31:30.217 --> 31:31.282
Simmons is
on the move.

31:34.954 --> 31:36.887
Mark Simmons...

31:36.889 --> 31:38.288
Federal agents.

31:40.158 --> 31:41.891
KENSI:
Stop!

32:19.997 --> 32:21.997
CALLEN: Didn't take cover
behind the Dumpster very long.

32:21.999 --> 32:24.232
He just came out firing.

32:24.234 --> 32:25.967
Like he wanted us
to shoot him.

32:25.969 --> 32:28.970
Suicide by cop?
Why hide behind
the Dumpster at all?

32:28.972 --> 32:31.289
DEEKS: Maybe he was hoping
it would buy him enough time

32:31.290 --> 32:33.607
to pick one of us off.
Then he would have fired
from behind the Dumpster.

32:33.609 --> 32:35.475
Doesn't make
any sense.

32:36.344 --> 32:38.344
Got a wallet, keys,
a little cash.

32:38.346 --> 32:40.713
No cell phone?
No.

32:55.996 --> 32:59.330
ERIC: Simmons' call history
connects him to a Karim Mubar,

32:59.332 --> 33:02.399
a known Al-Qaeda sympathizer
here in Los Angeles.

33:02.401 --> 33:04.401
What is a card-carrying member
of the PFA doing

33:04.403 --> 33:06.403
with an operative
from Al-Qaeda?

33:06.405 --> 33:08.037
Well, we have something
that might help.

33:08.039 --> 33:10.305
Security cam footage
of the mosque shooting.

33:10.307 --> 33:12.506
Keep an eye on the young man
just before he's shot.

33:15.310 --> 33:17.143
He said something.

33:18.546 --> 33:20.612
Play that back slowly.

33:21.982 --> 33:23.214
Now zoom in.

33:27.119 --> 33:29.719
(no voice)

33:29.721 --> 33:31.454
Kens?

33:31.456 --> 33:34.356
<i>"Allahu Akbar."</i>

33:34.358 --> 33:36.224
Means "God is great."

33:36.226 --> 33:38.426
It's a beautiful phrase.

33:38.427 --> 33:40.627
Most suicide bombers say it
before they blow themselves up.

33:40.630 --> 33:42.630
He knew Simmons was
gonna kill him.

33:42.632 --> 33:44.331
Why?

33:44.333 --> 33:47.534
My guess is to make it look like
PFA is killing innocent Muslims,

33:47.536 --> 33:51.037
stir up anti-American sentiment.

33:51.039 --> 33:52.505
Simmons was working
with Al-Qaeda.

33:52.507 --> 33:55.374
They used him to get to Connor,
feed him the meds.

33:55.376 --> 33:57.042
So the PFA membership
was a ruse.

33:57.044 --> 34:01.112
Anybody got onto him,
the trail leads back to the PFA.

34:01.114 --> 34:03.447
DEEKS: So both Simmons
and the young Muslim

34:03.449 --> 34:05.482
sacrificed themselves
for the cause.

34:05.484 --> 34:09.452
Unfortunately, that still leaves
Mr. Rutnam in Al-Qaeda's sway.

34:09.454 --> 34:11.487
Must be saving him
for something big.

34:11.489 --> 34:15.524
Maybe a high-ranking member
of the Muslim community?

34:15.526 --> 34:18.593
Do we have anything
that puts Simmons and Mubar

34:18.595 --> 34:21.162
in a common location
recently?

34:24.233 --> 34:26.466
Yes, credit card
records put them

34:26.468 --> 34:30.803
at a cafe downtown half a dozen
times in the past couple weeks.

34:30.805 --> 34:33.238
Any mosques
near that cafe?

34:34.608 --> 34:36.625
No,

34:36.626 --> 34:38.643
but the Cantara Cultural Center
is just two blocks west.

34:38.645 --> 34:40.411
And Amare Hassan
is scheduled

34:40.413 --> 34:44.381
to speak at a religious unity
conference later today.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.149
Hassan is a very well-respected
and popular Mullah.

34:46.151 --> 34:49.118
He speaks out
against extremists.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.086
His assassination would light
a huge fire

34:51.088 --> 34:52.087
in the Islamic community.

34:52.089 --> 34:54.489
It's a perfect target.

34:54.491 --> 34:56.357
Event like that is gonna have
some serious security.

34:56.359 --> 34:59.760
Which makes Connor Rutnam
the perfect assassin.

35:05.467 --> 35:08.568
PILOT: Eagle One on site,
beginning rooftop search.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.469
CONTROL: Copy, Eagle One.

35:10.471 --> 35:12.470
Kensi, Deeks,
you in position?

35:14.774 --> 35:16.440
Just got set up.

35:16.442 --> 35:18.842
DEEKS:
I got the podium in my sights.

35:18.844 --> 35:22.478
Which means if Connor's
out there, he does, too.

35:27.384 --> 35:29.317
Hetty, have you been in touch
with the event coordinators?

35:29.319 --> 35:32.787
Yes, and unfortunately
Mr. Hassan refuses

35:32.789 --> 35:34.555
to cancel his address.

35:34.557 --> 35:38.125
He feels it would signal
an act of cowardice.

35:38.127 --> 35:40.660
And that means it's on us.

35:40.662 --> 35:42.562
Deeks!

35:42.563 --> 35:44.463
Anything
on the surrounding rooftops?

35:44.465 --> 35:46.231
I got nothing, yet.

35:46.233 --> 35:48.566
Connor's field of fire has
a number of distant buildings

35:48.568 --> 35:49.800
he can make the shot from.

35:52.271 --> 35:54.437
How you doing behind
that scope, Kensi?

35:54.439 --> 35:55.671
I'm good.

35:57.207 --> 35:59.307
DEEKS:
Copy that, she's good.

35:59.309 --> 36:01.242
Eagle One, anything?

36:01.244 --> 36:02.743
PILOT:
Negative contact.

36:02.745 --> 36:03.810
Over.

36:05.847 --> 36:08.514
We've got our eyes on every
distant building out there.

36:08.516 --> 36:10.616
Maybe that's the problem.

36:10.618 --> 36:13.485
Whoever set this up wanted
the insurance

36:13.487 --> 36:15.620
that his long-distance sniper
didn't be spotted.

36:15.622 --> 36:17.855
Put him in a closer building.

36:17.857 --> 36:19.323
Yep.

36:21.493 --> 36:23.726
GRANGER (over radio): Eagle One,
let's change it up.

36:23.728 --> 36:25.594
Begin checking
the immediate area.

36:25.596 --> 36:27.228
PILOT:
Copy that.

36:37.906 --> 36:39.639
I got movement.

36:43.478 --> 36:45.444
GRANGER: Sitrep, Agent Blye.

36:49.516 --> 36:52.583
I got Connor plus two,
under the tarp at one o'clock.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.650
I got 'em.

36:53.652 --> 36:55.585
What's the location?

36:55.587 --> 36:59.488
Uh, distance and bearing from
Kensi's scope data puts us at...

36:59.490 --> 37:01.857
605 West Olympic Boulevard,
northeast corner.

37:01.859 --> 37:04.192
We're one block out.

37:05.495 --> 37:07.161
GRANGER:
Agent Blye,

37:07.163 --> 37:08.428
if Connor lines up a shot,
you take him out.

37:08.430 --> 37:10.363
KENSI:
Copy that.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.865
(tires screech)

37:17.370 --> 37:18.702
Kensi, we're here.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.571
Connor in position, yet?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.606
Almost...

37:24.408 --> 37:25.407
GRANGER: Kensi,

37:25.409 --> 37:26.841
we can't take any chances.

37:29.378 --> 37:30.543
Kens.

37:31.546 --> 37:33.178
Hold off!
We're almost there!

37:33.180 --> 37:34.679
Kens, you good?

37:34.681 --> 37:35.746
I'm fine.

37:37.382 --> 37:39.849
GRANGER: Agent Blye, you're not
gonna get another opportunity.

37:39.851 --> 37:42.518
This isn't his fault!
Just give us a chance!

37:42.520 --> 37:44.619
GRANGER:
We have to stop him.

37:48.257 --> 37:49.589
All right, Sam and Callen
are on the roof.

37:55.629 --> 37:58.796
Take the shot, Agent Blye.

37:58.798 --> 38:01.498
Kensi, take the shot now.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.699
Sam, I'm sorry.

38:04.202 --> 38:05.734
Federal agents!

38:05.736 --> 38:07.202
Get back!

38:20.650 --> 38:21.749
Stay down, Gunny.

38:24.253 --> 38:26.286
That's a hell of
a shot, partner.

38:26.288 --> 38:27.754
(gasping quietly)

38:27.756 --> 38:28.821
Yeah.

38:31.292 --> 38:33.691
Hands on your head.

38:35.695 --> 38:36.860
Okay, don't move, Gunny.

38:36.862 --> 38:38.695
Get up. Get up.

38:38.697 --> 38:40.697
Get up.

38:40.699 --> 38:41.698
All right.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.700
Stay still, Gunny.

38:43.702 --> 38:46.369
Okay, give me your hand.

38:46.371 --> 38:48.704
It's gonna be okay,
all right?

38:48.706 --> 38:49.805
It's gonna be okay.

38:57.247 --> 38:59.413
HETTY:
I just got word

38:59.415 --> 39:01.415
that Mr. Hanna has safely
returned Mr. Rutnam

39:01.417 --> 39:03.867
to the VA hospital.

39:03.868 --> 39:06.318
His wife and daughter are going
to join him shortly.

39:06.321 --> 39:08.688
Well, that is great.

39:13.727 --> 39:16.027
SAM:
Ah...

39:16.029 --> 39:17.561
He's out there.

39:17.563 --> 39:18.595
He's waiting for you.

39:18.597 --> 39:20.730
Thank you so much.

39:35.513 --> 39:37.579
¶ ¶

39:51.694 --> 39:53.560
(computer chimes)

39:53.562 --> 39:55.762
Oh, I got a message
from the mentoring site.

39:55.764 --> 39:58.731
I cannot wait to have
my first meeting with...

40:00.801 --> 40:02.033
...Byron?!

40:02.035 --> 40:03.634
CALLEN:
"Dear Mr. Deeks.

40:03.636 --> 40:04.968
"Due to
a scheduling conflict,

40:04.970 --> 40:06.970
"we've reassigned your case.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.404
Your new Little Brother is..."

40:08.406 --> 40:10.507
"Byron... Chester."

40:10.509 --> 40:11.808
KENSI:
"Byron's interests include

40:11.810 --> 40:13.293
"three-dimensional chess,

40:13.294 --> 40:14.777
advanced calculus
and..." (laughs)

40:14.779 --> 40:16.445
"German opera."
N-No, German...

40:16.447 --> 40:18.780
Uh, what happened to-to
fish tacos and-and surfing

40:18.782 --> 40:20.782
and the Three Stooges and the
floppy hair that this is...?

40:20.784 --> 40:21.783
Mr. Deeks.
Yeah.

40:21.785 --> 40:24.085
This is gonna be good practice.

40:24.087 --> 40:27.788
You can have all the
expectations you want

40:27.790 --> 40:29.055
when you have children,

40:29.057 --> 40:31.791
but you can never predict

40:31.793 --> 40:34.727
who you're going
to end up with.

40:35.996 --> 40:37.528
CALLEN: I think
Byron's gonna be great.

40:37.530 --> 40:38.896
Plus you never know
when a working knowledge

40:38.898 --> 40:41.064
of<i> The Magic Flute</i> is gonna
come in handy.

40:41.066 --> 40:42.598
That's a German
opera reference.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.865
I don't get that

40:43.867 --> 40:45.533
because I don't
know a German opera.

40:45.535 --> 40:47.568
Bravo, Mr. Deeks.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.736
Bravo.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.770
<i> Bravo.</i>
