01:56.720 --> 01:59.188
I'm off to the garage. You wanna lift?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.231
No, thanks.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.794
I'm gonna work the routine
a few more times.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.388
- Big day, huh?
- Yep.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.351
So you're packed?

02:08.479 --> 02:10.390
Almost.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.750
OK, see you later.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.116
- Hey.
- There you are.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.870
- Missed you at the party last night.
- Sorry, Wayne. I had to finish packing.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.560
- I burned you some travelling music.
- Oh!

02:43.680 --> 02:45.955
So, are you nervous?

02:46.080 --> 02:48.719
Not really. I'm more excited.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.434
Come on, it's the Chicago School
of Music and Dance.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.439
I know. I've only been dreaming about it
for as long as I can remember.

02:55.560 --> 03:00.190
The girls I'm up against, they trained with
the best teachers and choreographers.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.629
So you are nervous.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.389
Don't worry.
They'd be crazy not to take you.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.080
Has your brother lightened up at all?

03:09.200 --> 03:12.112
Hmm, you know how Joel can be.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.835
- He doesn't get it.
- He's just gonna miss you.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.999
This means me and my two left feet
will have to find a new dance partner!

03:20.120 --> 03:22.634
- You aren't that bad.
- Yeah, right!

03:23.840 --> 03:26.400
All right, good luck.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.153
- Get out of here.
- OK.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.873
- Good luck, Lauryn.
- Thanks, Marty.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.628
- Frankie quoted me 500.
- Course he did, he's a crook.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.830
I'll do it for 250. Pick it up after lunch.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.359
See you then.

04:01.480 --> 04:05.268
Hey, Clueless, I think she wanted
you to pick her up after lunch.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.712
Last month after payroll,
you're plus 600.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.273
Good month.

04:16.399 --> 04:20.075
That's still 1,800 behind
for the month before last.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.432
OK.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.279
I guess I'll be hitting the road.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.357
Joel... why am I on the schedule?

04:33.480 --> 04:35.550
Sorry, wishful thinking.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.956
Come on. I'm 21. It's now or never.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.353
If I nail this audition, I'm gonna be
in Chicago till my classes begin.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.475
Look, I got some interviews
together for you.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.434
Qualified bookkeepers to replace me.
Resumes are on my desk.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.950
15 grand a year tuition... I don't know
how you're gonna pull that off.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.469
With a part-time job, Joel.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.670
I promised after Mom and Dad died,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.870
I'd do whatever
to keep this place running.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.118
But I can't work in a garage all my life.
You know I've trained to be a dancer.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.912
Yeah, I know.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.679
All right.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.431
I'm outta here.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.719
Boss, if she don't work here no more,

05:36.840 --> 05:39.070
you think I could date her?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.954
Not if you want to live.

05:46.840 --> 05:53.871
# Take the other road,
go where I wanna go

05:54.000 --> 05:58.630
# Just like a jigsaw puzzle,
some piece is out of place

05:58.760 --> 06:02.719
# You've lost your own perception
on how to win this race

06:02.840 --> 06:07.789
# Cos everybody in the world
seems to sing the same song

06:07.920 --> 06:12.391
# Marching to the same beat,
playing from the same drum

06:12.520 --> 06:16.229
# But I ain't afraid to keep
my own eternity

06:16.360 --> 06:21.354
# I live my live, I do it my way... #

06:52.360 --> 06:55.158
- Excuse me, where do we check in?
- Up there.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.589
243. Next!

07:05.320 --> 07:07.595
- Name?
- Lauryn Kirk.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.836
Lauryn Kirk? 252.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.672
Next. Name?

07:34.160 --> 07:37.630
Thanks for coming in.
251?

07:41.560 --> 07:45.189
- I give her about a minute fifteen.
- You're kidding.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.834
If you last more than a minute,
you're lucky.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.317
Thank you. Thank you,
Stephanie, that's enough.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.955
That's not what we're looking for,
but thanks for coming in.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.356
Enjoy your time in Chicago.
Who's next?

08:19.160 --> 08:20.832
Number 252.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.789
Yeah, hi, how are you?

08:31.520 --> 08:34.511
Hi, I'm Lauryn Kirk
from Glenwood, Indiana.

08:34.640 --> 08:39.030
- So, what have you brought for us?
- It's... er... a piece that I put together.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.957
- May we see it?
- Yeah.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.516
That's OK. This is your time,
don't mind our schedule.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.031
Hello! Hello, hello, stop! Stop!

09:21.680 --> 09:24.114
We received 2,000 tapes.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.710
You're one of the 300 people
here today, congratulations.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.479
But now I need more.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.079
I... I don't understand.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.272
We're looking for dancers
who can express real emotion,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.755
not fragments of it.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.350
Something softer, more sensual,
more feminine.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.357
More honest.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.232
Thank you, Miss Kirk.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.599
Who's next?

09:54.520 --> 09:57.159
OK, let's get right to it.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.873
Right here.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.999
Thanks.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.712
252, huh?

10:22.680 --> 10:26.559
I remember that cattle call.
It's a tough school.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.639
You auditioned?

10:28.760 --> 10:32.275
Oh, I don't know
if I'd exactly call it an audition.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.630
I lasted all of a minute and 12 seconds.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.668
Should I even ask?

10:40.040 --> 10:43.032
It's harder than you thought
it was gonna be, huh?

10:43.160 --> 10:46.835
At least my brother back home
will be thrilled to know I didn't get in.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.316
Yeah, all my brothers and sisters live
in the same town where we grew up.

10:50.440 --> 10:55.275
They thought I was crazy moving here.
My dad didn't speak to me for weeks.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.391
Did it get better?

10:57.520 --> 11:00.159
Yeah, now he calls me all the time.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.671
That school only lets in one percent.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.792
That's like 20 out of the thousands
who apply,

11:06.920 --> 11:09.593
so don't be so hard on yourself.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.194
Hello?

11:34.320 --> 11:35.878
So how'd it go?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.479
OK.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.318
- You didn't get in?
- 'I didn't say that.'

11:42.120 --> 11:46.318
- So you did get in?
- They don't tell you right away.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.955
- Well, what does it look like?
- Looks good.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.795
- 'That sounds believable.'
- Look, Joel, I'm tired. OK, I...

11:54.920 --> 11:57.388
- 'Call me as soon as you know.'
- Yeah.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.630
I gotta go.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.399
Wait! Stop!

12:04.520 --> 12:07.273
Stop! Wait, stop!

12:08.600 --> 12:09.999
Stop!

12:40.880 --> 12:42.836
Hey, are you all right?

12:42.960 --> 12:46.873
Let's get you out of this rain.
Call the tow company from my place.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.718
Come on.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.957
I really appreciate this.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.640
No problem. Trust me, I've been there.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.514
When I first got here, I got knocked
down so many times I lost count.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.473
And the looks,
like you're just some hick from...

13:06.600 --> 13:08.511
Indiana? Mm-hmm.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.111
Oh, what am I gonna do?

13:12.240 --> 13:15.038
My brother thinks I'm going
to dance school. What do I tell him?

13:15.160 --> 13:19.153
"I didn't get in.
And, oh, yeah, they towed my car, too."

13:19.280 --> 13:22.750
I can't go home.
There's nothing for me there.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.872
- So don't go.
- What, you mean stay in Chicago?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.039
If you don't mind sleeping on the couch,
crash here while you figure it out.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.833
Wait, you don't snore, do you?

13:32.960 --> 13:35.110
Not the last time I checked.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.599
Lauryn Kirk.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.472
- Klirk?
- No. Kirk.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.709
- No, I don't have you down here.
- I think it's...

14:26.840 --> 14:29.434
You gonna have to go wait over there.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.637
Excuse me. Can I ask who you're with?

15:23.760 --> 15:27.309
Oh, I was... er...
I was invited... here by a friend.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.557
- Through the service door?
- Right... er...

15:30.680 --> 15:33.148
- Can I see your ID?
- Yeah, of course...

15:35.720 --> 15:38.712
- I'm really sorry about this.
- That's OK.

15:38.840 --> 15:42.150
Lauryn Kirk from Glenwood, Indiana.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.589
"Corn and cars", that's our motto.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.119
I like corn.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.674
Actually if you just give me
your phone number,

15:48.800 --> 15:52.156
we can settle this,
and it's kind of a house rule...

15:52.280 --> 15:54.032
- Hey, you made it.
- Hey.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.355
- Is this guy giving you a hard time?
- No!

15:57.200 --> 15:59.111
But I thought he was the manager.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.800
The manager?
No, Russ is the music director.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.512
Guilty.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.877
- Nice try.
- Well, it almost worked.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.197
Sort that out later.
I wanna introduce you to Brenda.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.958
Bye, Lauryn Kirk!

16:19.760 --> 16:22.479
Brenda, this is Lauryn and vice versa.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.070
You've been looking for her,
for the bookkeeping job.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.634
Thanks, but I'm not adopting
any more strays.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.877
I need you upstairs getting ready.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.070
Wait, wait.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.714
I know you don't want a stranger
looking into your books,

16:38.840 --> 16:41.877
but I know QuickBooks,
I can do payroll in my sleep,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.197
and your quarterly 1087
is due in seven days.

16:45.320 --> 16:49.074
If you pay your crew in cash, you'll need
a perfect Schedule E to avoid enquiries.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.034
I've cranked those out like clockwork for
my family's business since I was 17.

16:53.160 --> 16:56.914
But if you just need me to file stuff,
I can do that, too.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.032
- You done?
- Yeah.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.277
Fine. Trial basis, $12 an hour,
and no benefits.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.799
OK.

17:09.240 --> 17:13.233
This is where the girls change.
This is your home away from home.

17:13.359 --> 17:16.352
You get paid every other week.

17:16.480 --> 17:19.199
You'll start at 3:00
and stay till we close.

17:19.319 --> 17:23.358
If you can't find something, look harder.
It's all in here somewhere.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.191
You can start...

17:27.240 --> 17:30.437
...by organising the January receipts.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.152
No problem.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.034
Oh, by the way, the other bookkeeper...
lasted about a week.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.877
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Ruby's,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.309
the hottest spot in Chicago!

18:25.760 --> 18:31.073
# Hold the door, while I let myself in

18:33.320 --> 18:35.880
# I'm tired, boy

18:36.000 --> 18:39.231
# Need a drink, need a man

18:41.440 --> 18:45.274
# I'm not looking for trouble

18:45.400 --> 18:49.473
# I just want someone to tease

18:51.280 --> 18:54.955
# Maybe if you're lucky

18:55.080 --> 18:58.755
# I'll show you what I've got

18:58.880 --> 19:02.793
# But let's get one thing straight, dear

19:02.920 --> 19:07.038
# I get what I want

19:20.600 --> 19:26.516
# Here there, boy,
I am not like the rest

19:28.160 --> 19:34.076
# Let's have a dance,
while our souls get undressed

19:36.680 --> 19:40.150
# I don't care much for small talk

19:40.280 --> 19:44.273
# There's no need
to say a thing more

19:44.400 --> 19:48.313
# I can make you feel
something lovely

19:48.440 --> 19:51.876
# That you've never felt before

19:53.960 --> 20:00.718
# Maybe if you're lucky,
I'll show you what I've got

20:01.680 --> 20:05.798
# But let's get something straight, dear

20:05.920 --> 20:08.798
# I get what I want

20:43.040 --> 20:45.315
# Slow down, boy

20:45.440 --> 20:48.591
# Don't you step on my toes... #

21:14.920 --> 21:17.753
Hey, don't be late again.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.279
Aye-aye.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.753
- This goes on every night?
- Every night we're open.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.235
Brenda's got a real vision for the place.

21:26.360 --> 21:30.035
It's rooted in burlesque, but our dance
goes way beyond the traditional stuff.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.277
- Well, you were terrific up there.
- Thanks.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.472
What's up, girls? Good job tonight.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.195
- Brenda, hit me.
- Yes, wash this stuff down.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.153
Hey, this is Lauryn.
She's the new bookkeeper.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.118
Carmen's not interested
in any stories she's not the star of.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.152
Oh, still bummed I'm not the star
of your world any more?

21:50.280 --> 21:53.670
- Baby, stars burn out.
- Maybe you couldn't stand the heat.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.917
You guys wanna do some
after-hours damage at Junior's?

21:57.040 --> 21:59.634
- Yes. Cheers.
- Cheers!

22:01.840 --> 22:04.798
- Right, first round's on Lauryn!
- What?

22:39.480 --> 22:42.711
Can we have a Cosmo
and a gin and tonic, no ice?

22:42.840 --> 22:43.989
Hey, two.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.359
Let's get this party started.

23:27.320 --> 23:31.154
Aw, well, welcome to Chicago.
Congratulations on the new job.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.676
Cool about earlier?
Cos I was just playing.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.872
- So how long you worked at Ruby's?
- About a year.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.996
- You like it?
- There's worse ways to make a living.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.315
I'll bet there are.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.791
- Why aren't you out there?
- Not my kind of dancing.

24:05.920 --> 24:10.311
Sitting back, hiding in your hoodie...
That's your kind of dancing?

24:13.280 --> 24:15.555
So... er... you and Carmen?

24:15.680 --> 24:17.511
No. No.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.279
That was like a 24-hour flu.

24:20.400 --> 24:24.552
You get it, you get really sick,
and then you get over it.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.872
So arrogant. "Are you just hide
out there in your hoodie?"

24:37.000 --> 24:41.949
Russ likes giving people a hard time,
especially if he thinks they're cute.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.071
Please.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.078
Russ was right.
You should've been on the floor with us.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.953
What, dancing like Carmen? Shakin' it?

24:54.960 --> 24:56.791
Work it. Ha!

24:57.800 --> 24:59.552
I love it.

24:59.680 --> 25:04.037
Seriously, you're missing another side
you could bring to your dancing.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.276
I'm not dancing right now, remember?

25:22.880 --> 25:25.394
Hey, you're looking good.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.319
Why do my feet hate me?

25:30.440 --> 25:34.035
I don't know. Maybe it's cos
you're going from the twist into a step.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.071
Like you're missing something.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.112
- Right. I'll just eighty-six the combo.
- No, it's...

25:39.240 --> 25:44.519
No, I think the combination's fine.
It's just I think you're missing a piece.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.029
Like, if it was my thing

25:47.160 --> 25:51.836
and I wanted to do that
I would just go... here to there.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.713
Hmm...
Could you show me that again?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.353
Sure, it's simple.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.151
- Here.
- Here...

25:59.280 --> 26:01.316
Then here.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.271
Then there.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.789
- There... I like that.
- Yeah?

26:05.920 --> 26:08.309
Watch your back, D.
Girl's got moves.

26:08.440 --> 26:12.672
- Maybe you should watch yours.
- Her moves ain't that good.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.278
Maybe you should give it a try,
get up on stage one night.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.799
Are you kidding?

26:19.920 --> 26:23.390
I would fall on my ass in those heels.
Seriously, people would get hurt.

26:23.520 --> 26:26.990
- Shut up, you've got steps.
- No, it's not my thing.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.873
Oh, OK, and those clothes are?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.514
Seriously, Lauryn,
they're killing your sexy.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.349
- My sexy?
- Yeah, every dancer's got a sexy.

26:36.480 --> 26:39.950
You just got to find yours.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.515
# That's how we do it on the weekend

26:45.640 --> 26:48.916
# Turn up the radio
and let the speakers blow

26:49.040 --> 26:53.477
# Get your shoes on,
feel the party go get started... #

27:10.320 --> 27:12.231
Without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

27:12.360 --> 27:15.955
put your hands together for Dana!

27:22.840 --> 27:24.558
Go, Dana!

28:42.000 --> 28:44.355
Hey, Lauryn, meet Marcus.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.630
Oh, hi. Dana's told me all about you.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.230
You should've seen your girlfriend
on stage tonight. She nailed it.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.713
Really?

28:51.840 --> 28:54.149
We're gonna catch a bite to eat.
Wanna to join us?

28:54.280 --> 28:57.113
Oh, no, you two go.
I've got to finish up here...

28:57.240 --> 28:58.832
Yeah, you sure?

28:58.960 --> 29:02.475
- Yeah.
- OK, all right. Well, catch you later.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.194
- Like tomorrow.
- Bye.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.390
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.034
OK, I'm out of here.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.799
Hello?

29:34.920 --> 29:36.319
Anybody here?

31:18.360 --> 31:21.352
I can't believe he said that.
Me either.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.915
You're still not taking
your brother's calls?

31:31.040 --> 31:34.316
Just not up for it.
He still thinks I'm in school.

31:34.440 --> 31:37.113
You can't hide here
and avoid him forever.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.993
- You've got to tell him sometime.
- I know.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.156
OK.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.633
- Come on, Cinderella.
- I gotta work, you guys go.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.471
Bye, see you.

32:15.960 --> 32:20.112
Hi. Nice moves.

32:20.240 --> 32:23.357
- What are you?
- I'm not gonna tell anybody.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.675
But just a hint...

32:25.800 --> 32:28.109
If you want to keep a secret,

32:28.240 --> 32:30.993
don't rehearse where you work,

32:31.120 --> 32:34.669
unless you know you're the only one
with a set of keys.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.959
Thanks, I'll try to remember that.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.759
You know, er...

32:43.880 --> 32:46.872
Think I could pry you away?
Maybe grab a drink?

32:48.320 --> 32:50.675
Not real thirsty.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.159
Cool.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.237
Cool. Er... next time.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.759
I could eat.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.151
Well, I got the perfect place.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.671
Growing up, my mom used
to tell me stories about Chicago,

33:15.800 --> 33:19.156
the lights, energy, the people.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.033
She dreamed of coming here
and being a dancer.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.869
- That's where you got the moves from.
- Yep. She studied to be one.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.357
Chose to be a mom instead.
So she passed the dream down to me.

33:30.480 --> 33:33.552
- Is she still in Glenwood?
- No, no. She passed away.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.995
I'm sorry.

33:38.120 --> 33:41.635
She got pretty sick when I was about 10,

33:41.760 --> 33:45.070
and it took a lot out of us,
especially my dad.

33:45.200 --> 33:49.352
After Mom, he just...
spent all his time in the garage.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.793
He said it kept his mind off missing her.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.228
And then one night, three years ago,

33:57.360 --> 34:00.272
I was coming back to the garage
after a recital.

34:00.400 --> 34:04.552
Joel was in Indy picking up equipment
and he'd asked me to stay with Dad.

34:04.680 --> 34:08.672
But some dancer friends
wanted to go out to dinner.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.360
Later when I did get to the garage...

34:12.840 --> 34:15.353
...I found him on the floor.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.914
He'd had a heart attack.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.639
I always wonder if I'd just got there
10 minutes earlier...

34:22.760 --> 34:25.558
You can't do that to yourself.

34:26.760 --> 34:31.914
After that, I put school on hold
to stay and help Joel out with the shop.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.554
Since losing Dad,
it's just been the two of us.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.554
That had to be hard.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.750
You know, all of it.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.279
Yeah.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.676
So what's in there?

34:48.800 --> 34:52.270
This? This is the best
sweet and sour shrimp in Chicago.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.879
- Really?
- Want some?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.433
Sure.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.910
Yeah, that's Lincoln Park,

35:03.040 --> 35:06.828
where all the kids hang out
with the students and what not.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.428
Then you got downtown,
where the bankers are.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.915
That's pretty much Chicago.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.879
Well...

35:15.720 --> 35:18.996
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.519
Anytime.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.918
I don't remember seeing that
on the menu.

35:28.040 --> 35:31.237
Yeah, well, that's the Chef's Special.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.958
Good night.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.672
Good night.

35:53.720 --> 35:56.632
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.830
- How's it going?
- Good.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.194
So I had a good time last night.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.719
Me, too.

36:04.840 --> 36:08.435
You have got to be kidding me.
Carmen's running late.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.949
Doesn't Dana go on first anyway?

36:11.080 --> 36:14.197
Do you see Dana?
No, because she called in sick.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.278
- And I have a line...
- I can spin till Carmen gets here.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.233
I have three birthday parties
and a room full of VIPs.

36:20.360 --> 36:23.830
No offence, Russ,
but they didn't come to hear you spin.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.918
- You could let Lauryn dance.
- What?

36:27.040 --> 36:29.838
Brenda, I've seen her dance,
OK, she's good.

36:29.960 --> 36:33.236
Why don't you just give her a shot?

36:33.360 --> 36:38.229
Look, Lauryn, you're a sweet kid,
but you're obviously no dancer.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.752
Why did you tell her that?

36:42.880 --> 36:45.110
What, you're gonna hide out
back here?

36:45.240 --> 36:47.390
What you saw me doing
was fooling around.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.796
- I don't dance like Ruby's girls.
- So do your thing.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.117
Trust me, when you get on stage,
nobody's gonna care.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.798
Well, I care.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.630
You moved to Chicago to be a dancer.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.638
I moved here to go to school.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.598
OK.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.312
I'm sorry.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.075
Look, price doesn't matter
as long as you get her here.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.758
Yes, a cab.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.075
How long? All right.
Thanks, I'll give them a try.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.315
Joe, it's Brenda,
I need a girl right away.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.032
Give me a shot.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.718
I can do it.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.389
Get off the stage!

38:13.520 --> 38:15.715
What is this, amateur night?

40:00.240 --> 40:02.800
We have a tradition.
After your first dance...

40:04.320 --> 40:06.914
...a toast on the house.
- Thank you.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.953
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you rehearsed for tonight.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.798
Beginner's luck.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.195
"Beginner"...you got that right.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.273
Well...

40:21.400 --> 40:23.868
...that just proves
how good you were tonight.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.434
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.632
You wanna get out of here?

40:34.040 --> 40:36.429
Really?
You grew up around a garage?

40:36.560 --> 40:38.710
Yeah, I know
my way around a car.

40:38.840 --> 40:42.515
- I'd like to see you as a grease monkey.
- Oh, yeah.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.235
That'd be Joel's dream come true,
keeping me in that shop.

40:46.360 --> 40:51.229
- Well, he's just a protective brother.
- A little too protective.

40:51.360 --> 40:56.275
He doesn't want me to get my hopes up,
so he means well, I guess.

40:57.720 --> 41:01.872
- This is really impressive.
- It's my entire life, right here.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.908
- That yours, too?
- Mm-hm.

41:06.040 --> 41:09.555
Yeah, I gotta admit something
that's been bothering me for a while.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.750
What's that?

41:11.880 --> 41:13.472
I lied.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.679
When I said I liked corn,
that was a blatant lie.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.234
I actually hate corn.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.478
Wow. I feel betrayed, like I don't
even know you any more...

41:26.560 --> 41:31.270
- Play me something you wrote.
- What, now? No. No, it's...

41:31.400 --> 41:33.356
Quit stalling, Music Man.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.517
OK.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.437
OK.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.792
This one I'll play you is...
It's not finished yet.

41:43.920 --> 41:48.232
And... er... you know, don't judge it.
OK, please?

41:48.360 --> 41:50.430
- OK.
- OK.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.958
This is you?

42:05.080 --> 42:07.071
Yeah, I just, I looped the vocals.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.397
- On the sax, that's you, too?
- Mm-hm.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.435
You should play more.

42:16.240 --> 42:17.832
You're good.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.359
Thanks.

42:21.720 --> 42:24.871
So that's pretty much it.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.798
- It's not finished.
- Why not?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.434
Cos I haven't got around to it.

42:35.680 --> 42:38.114
I think someone's eager
to change the subject.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.912
Yeah. Yeah.

42:40.040 --> 42:43.669
This your thing?
Going though all the girls at the club?

42:43.800 --> 42:46.360
- Mm-hm, all of them.
- That's what I thought.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.438
First Carmen and then who else?

42:49.560 --> 42:52.393
You know,
somebody needs to shut you up.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.670
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.

43:03.200 --> 43:06.875
- What's wrong?
- I think I had too much to drink.

43:08.360 --> 43:12.194
Well, then, you... er... shouldn't drive.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.509
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

43:20.080 --> 43:23.072
That's not what I was talking about.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.119
Hey. Got your email.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.835
Yeah, I was gonna call you. I got a job.

45:08.400 --> 45:12.757
- At a garage?
- No, at a club, called Ruby's.

45:14.440 --> 45:18.035
OK, what's with the silence?

45:18.160 --> 45:21.755
Had to let Marty go.
It's no biggie, just a little downsizing.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.996
'So how's the school? '

45:24.120 --> 45:25.872
It's good.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.436
I sent you some stuff I found
in the attic I thought you might want.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.915
- 'Some of Mom's things.'
- Thanks.

45:33.760 --> 45:37.799
I gotta go. I booked some studio time
and my class is starting, so I should...

45:37.920 --> 45:41.515
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Take care.

45:58.720 --> 46:03.077
Lauryn, I have three regulars outside
asking when they'll see you dance again.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.760
I told them tonight. Can you be ready?

46:05.880 --> 46:07.438
Yeah.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.955
You haven't earned the right
to be on that stage.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.310
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you're a dime a dozen.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.079
Just another girl from Bumbalow
trying to make it big.

46:21.200 --> 46:24.909
Guess what, this is the real world and
people come to see something special.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.600
Not that stuff you do.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.836
Bullshit, Carmen.
I've trained my whole life.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.313
Please.

46:31.440 --> 46:34.591
The tradition takes years to perfect.
You don't just roll in and own it.

46:34.720 --> 46:37.109
Lauryn, ten minutes and you're up.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.795
What's going on?

46:40.920 --> 46:44.879
Break a leg. Really. I mean it.

46:49.200 --> 46:52.112
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a warm Ruby's welcome

46:52.240 --> 46:55.516
to the newest addition
to the family... Lauryn!

48:14.720 --> 48:17.029
Like you said, girl's got moves.

48:59.640 --> 49:03.474
So... er... this school
you auditioned for,

49:03.600 --> 49:06.672
did they say anything, you know,
like why you didn't get in?

49:06.800 --> 49:09.075
Sort of, I guess.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.270
Can I be honest with you?

49:11.400 --> 49:14.233
I think whoever made that decision
is nuts.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.679
OK, the director of the dance
department didn't like my routine.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.836
He said he thought it wasn't...

49:22.960 --> 49:25.952
sensual or feminine enough
or something like that.

49:26.080 --> 49:29.311
Let's wrestle him into Ruby's one night
and prove him wrong.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.477
I don't think he's looking
for Ruby's kind of dancers.

49:32.600 --> 49:35.068
This guy can't have final say
in your life.

49:35.200 --> 49:39.716
Well, no offence, but he is
a world-renowned choreographer,

49:39.840 --> 49:44.311
so I think he knows a little bit more
about dance than me and you.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.908
Well, I know what I see and...

49:47.040 --> 49:50.919
...I see that you could be as sexy
as Carmen if you wanted to be.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.270
Oh, really?

49:53.400 --> 49:55.231
You know what, Russ?

49:55.360 --> 49:58.909
My life's goal isn't
to be as sexy as Carmen.

49:59.040 --> 50:02.635
- Hey... I'm sorry, that came out wrong.
- Oh, you think?

50:02.760 --> 50:06.309
Yeah. This isn't about Carmen,
this is about you.

50:07.480 --> 50:10.392
You can mix it up better
than any of those girls at Ruby's,

50:10.520 --> 50:12.511
and trust me, I've seen 'em all.

50:12.640 --> 50:15.791
And you have the potential
to go so much further.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.911
That's all I was trying to say.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.951
What?

50:26.640 --> 50:28.392
Come on.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.877
Ow! You know, you're kind of cute
when you're mad.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.514
- I'm not talking to you.
- I'm just saying.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.868
Shut up!

51:26.640 --> 51:28.312
Mom...

51:36.880 --> 51:38.598
Hey.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.233
Hey.

51:40.360 --> 51:44.399
Your routine felt a little off tonight.
Something on your mind?

51:45.320 --> 51:48.949
Just... some stuff from back home,
I guess.

51:53.360 --> 51:57.831
My favourite teacher once told me...
dance is a window to the soul.

51:59.040 --> 52:01.235
It doesn't let you hide.

52:03.320 --> 52:05.880
But if you always fight what you feel,

52:06.000 --> 52:10.596
you'll never tap into what could
make you not just a good dancer

52:10.720 --> 52:12.233
but a great one.

52:14.920 --> 52:16.319
Yeah.

52:21.840 --> 52:23.717
Lock up when you leave, OK?

52:23.840 --> 52:25.239
OK.

54:07.440 --> 54:10.432
# Get off the wall,
don't matter what they think

54:10.560 --> 54:13.279
# From your fingertips
to your toes

54:13.400 --> 54:15.868
# You know you're hot,
so let everybody know

54:16.000 --> 54:19.197
- # Gotta take it low
- # Bottoms up, bottoms up...

54:27.200 --> 54:30.670
# Yeah, keep it movin', man,
make it poppin', man

54:30.800 --> 54:33.360
# I'm on the move,
gotta catch me when you can

54:33.480 --> 54:35.516
# Might see my face
on the movie screen

54:35.640 --> 54:38.154
# Hypnotise you frame by frame,
scene by scene

54:38.280 --> 54:40.555
# Get your head up, do your thang

54:40.680 --> 54:44.150
# Get off the wall,
don't matter what they think... #

55:19.320 --> 55:20.753
Coming.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.751
Is something wrong?

55:32.880 --> 55:34.711
No, not at all.

55:34.840 --> 55:37.229
You just look amazing. Come on in.

55:45.360 --> 55:47.351
You are a closet romantic.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.753
Well, I've been called worse.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.599
Shall we?

56:01.800 --> 56:03.438
Wait. Let me.

56:05.880 --> 56:08.235
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56:11.360 --> 56:14.989
- May I offer you some wine?
- Yes, please.

56:17.800 --> 56:19.233
Thank you.

56:20.880 --> 56:25.635
Oh, no. I gotta check the oven.
I'll be right back.

56:34.760 --> 56:37.035
How about a take-out?

56:38.240 --> 56:39.832
I don't know, it's like...

56:39.960 --> 56:42.952
...as long as the shop is alive,
a little piece of my parents is, too.

56:43.080 --> 56:46.356
So, it would kill me
if Joel ever closed it.

56:46.480 --> 56:50.553
- You two sound close.
- We've had our moments.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.309
So I wanted to thank you
for the other night.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.839
For what?

56:56.520 --> 56:58.238
You were right.

56:58.360 --> 57:01.511
I can't let somebody I've met once
decide what I want.

57:01.640 --> 57:06.395
So I did some research... and...

57:06.520 --> 57:10.957
...the School of Music and Dance usually
accepts 20 applicants in a school year.

57:12.200 --> 57:14.350
But this year only 18 qualified.

57:14.480 --> 57:17.472
So they're holding
a second round of auditions

57:17.600 --> 57:20.797
for the next semester
to find their remaining two dancers.

57:20.920 --> 57:22.672
You're gonna re-audition?

57:22.800 --> 57:26.554
I think so. In three weeks.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.478
...the problem was the record company
got in my business,

57:29.600 --> 57:31.875
trying to tell me how to do it,
you know.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.195
I thought I knew better, so...

57:35.840 --> 57:38.195
...so I walked away.

57:38.320 --> 57:41.915
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

57:42.040 --> 57:44.508
I backed out of the deal and...

57:45.240 --> 57:48.835
...fell in with the wrong crowd,
and... er...

57:48.960 --> 57:51.349
...and... er... you know?

57:51.480 --> 57:54.756
Eventually, I ended up at Ruby's,

57:54.880 --> 57:57.155
and I straightened myself out.

57:58.640 --> 58:00.710
See, here's the thing.

58:03.320 --> 58:07.916
See, everybody who walks away
from a dream has a reason.

58:10.280 --> 58:12.271
I think it's brave...

58:13.520 --> 58:16.193
...to take another shot.

58:19.680 --> 58:24.435
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm doing it all wrong.

58:24.560 --> 58:26.551
Well, you're not.

58:58.400 --> 59:00.436
# Listen to me...

59:25.800 --> 59:28.109
# You know how much you want him

59:28.240 --> 59:31.755
# You're trying to be cool about it,
you're trying to be big about it

59:31.880 --> 59:35.236
# You're constantly just denying

59:35.360 --> 59:39.876
# You're like a moth to a flame,
can hardly wait but listen

59:40.000 --> 59:42.878
# Cause I know what I'm saying... #

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.431
Joel, stop!

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.959
Wait!

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.552
- Could you put some clothes on?
- What are you doing here?

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.955
I came to congratulate you
on getting into the school,

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.389
only they've never heard
of a Lauryn Kirk.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.351
You call this chasing your dreams?

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.914
Is this all the hard work
you've been doing?

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.119
I didn't get in.
I didn't know how to tell you.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.789
But if you'd stuck around,
you'd see how difficult the routines are.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.718
- I saw enough.
- Why don't you listen for a change?

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.638
I'm on the verge of losing the shop,
and I drove six hours for this.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.877
- What do you mean?
- I have to sell or the bank'll foreclose.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.797
- I can't make the payments.
- What?

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.354
- Equipment, leases, everything.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.391
Why would you care?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.149
You're a big city girl now,
you're a dancer.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.669
Why have you always had
a problem with me dancing?

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.394
You think the world revolves around you,
you always have!

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.798
How dare you? I put my life on hold
for three years, Joel!

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.550
And you put Dad on hold that night!
You should've been there, Lauryn!

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.511
Hey, you OK?

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.914
Maybe he was upset
because you were so bad.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.952
Ease off, Carmen. She was killing it.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.550
He drives hours to get here, then
has her embarrass the family name.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.831
- Hey, hey, stop, stop.
- I'm sick of your shit.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.315
Enough!

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.749
You happy, Carmen?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.399
God, girl.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.036
Lauryn! Lauryn, wait!
She's just trying to get in your head.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.833
She can get in line cos there's
enough going on in there already.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.951
Hey, come on.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.868
I know that this was a lot,
but he knows now.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.436
- You don't have to lie any more.
- What if he's right?

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.358
All my life my family gave up
so much for me.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.277
What if I'm selfish?

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.109
What are you going to do,
you just going to quit dancing?

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.597
- Gonna quit living your life?
- Joel's the only family I have.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.711
I shouldn't be here
chasing some stupid dream.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.559
I should be home helping him.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.437
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Who do you think you're fooling?

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.473
I know you're going home
because you're scared of that audition.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.874
What?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.629
If this was about your brother,
you'd have told him before tonight.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.079
What are you talking about?

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.670
I know that you're running
because you're scared and that's it.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.634
I'm sorry if it shocks you that I'd help
my family out in a time of crisis,

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.672
but that's how we do things
where I come from.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.191
Lauryn, come on.
Lauryn, you're making a big mistake.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.879
Lauryn!

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.719
What are you doing here?

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.720
I found two new wholesalers
we can use.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.868
- That should catch us up half-way.
- Wait, just slow down for a second.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.356
- Are you back here to work?
- I'm not gonna let you sell.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.153
We can catch up.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.716
Look, I...
said some things I didn't mean.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.398
I know.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.636
I'm sorry. OK?

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.752
Can I just get back to this? I was almost
done with last month's reviews.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.438
Yeah.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.996
Look, are you sure about this, Lauryn?
Being back?

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.388
It was Dad's shop.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.715
You know what it meant to him.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.639
Hey...

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.150
...you remember that time

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.078
that you got the bicycle
on your eighth birthday?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.830
Yeah, I drove it in the shop, crashed
into the Buick and chipped my tooth.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.791
Yeah!

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.958
I can dance another time, Joel.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.916
I'm here now.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.594
Hey, it's me.
Er... I was just calling to say hi.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.556
'And... er... I'm not burning
the chicken any more, so... '

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.077
I hope you come back soon.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.593
'Bye.'

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.674
Hey, stranger.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.713
I hear the last school audition
is this weekend.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.239
I know.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.033
You're going to be there, right?

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.073
You know, I'm just... I'm really...
buried in paperwork here and...

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.988
'Come on, Lauryn.
Have you talked to Russ? '

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.755
No. He called, but...

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.075
'You should, you know.'

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.351
Look, I'll talk to you later, OK?

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.391
Yeah.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.879
Bye.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:13.318
Oh, hey, I love this song.
Come on. Come on.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.993
I need an alternator permit.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.354
For old time's sake.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.037
Wednesday?

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.711
#... we know how to become
number one in a hot party show

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.558
- # Now push it
- # Ah, push it

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.270
- # Push it good
- # Ah, push it

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:38.073
- # Push it real good
- # Ah, push it... #

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.674
- Oh, hey, I thought you left already.
- Just finishing up.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.950
Yeah, it's never done, is it?

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.831
After Mum and Dad,

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.837
you never quit...

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.591
...never threw in the towel.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.991
I guess.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.999
You're the most unselfish person I know.
And you know what?

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.192
You have always been
one hell of a dancer.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.032
Don't know how it happened.
Certainly wasn't cos I encouraged you.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.753
Speaking of which, you're fired.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.517
What? Joel, without me
you'll lose Dad's shop.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.234
It's not Dad's shop any more, it's mine.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.477
And I have to take care of it, not you.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.036
Lauryn, I'm not going to let you
sell out your dreams to live mine.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.674
So you need to get in your car,

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.032
drive back to Chicago
and kick that audition's ass.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.957
All right?

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.631
Get out of here.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.360
Lauryn!

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.755
- What are you doing here?
- Where else would I be?

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.553
Here, I made you a track.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.397
What are you waiting for?
Go do your thing.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.951
Thank you.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.159
- Excuse me, this is a closed session.
- Yes, I'm here to audition.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.669
- Miss?
- Kirk. Lauryn Kirk.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.952
Right. We held a set of auditions
this morning for those re-applying.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.038
We're only seeing first-time applicants
this afternoon.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.310
But I just drove 300 miles.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.516
And my staff will do their best
to reschedule you for next year.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.915
No, thank you. I'm here now.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.989
Well... I trust you've brought something
more interesting than last time.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.190
Is that correct?

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.556
I'll let you decide.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.913
Woo!

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.110
That's how you do it!

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.991
Thank you, Miss Kirk.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.829
I'm afraid you're right,
some things should not be rescheduled.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.158
See you next semester.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.272
- Thank you.
- My girl! Right here!

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.711
Congratulations.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.272
Hi.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.711
She's not in the best mood.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.070
Only employees are allowed in
before we're open.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.918
I... er...

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.999
- I just came by to get my cheque.
- Your cheque?

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.317
After the jam you left us in
when you took off like that,

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.317
you think I owe you a cheque?

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.271
I'm really sorry.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.597
OK, I promise it had nothing to do
with Ruby's. I love this place.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.029
Surprise!

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.990
- Got you.
- What?

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.517
Hey, congratulations.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.471
Hey, Lauryn, look...
I'm sorry about all the BS, OK?

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.149
I was just giving you a taste
of what I got when I started.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.795
I'm just glad you're getting out of here
so I can get my stage back.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.269
- Congratulations, sis.
- I'm glad you came.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.595
- I'm proud of you.
- Can I have a turn?

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.119
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.994
- You'll be sorely missed around here.
- I'm only a couple of blocks away.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:09.007
Good cos I don't need any
distractions when I'm making my album.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.395
- It's about time.
- I know. Cheers.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:16.593
What's everybody standing around for?
Is this a dance club or what?

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360
