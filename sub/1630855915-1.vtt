WEBVTT

01:00.133 --> 01:03.236
Our story
starts hundreds of years ago

01:03.236 --> 01:05.938
when the only daughter
of an 18th-century

01:05.938 --> 01:10.609
aristocratic family, who was
betrothed to Javanese royalty,

01:10.609 --> 01:13.712
renounced everything.

01:13.712 --> 01:16.349
Her title, her riches,

01:16.349 --> 01:18.717
much to her family's
displeasure.

01:18.717 --> 01:23.789
She was Marshanda Damayanti,
the princess pirate.

01:47.213 --> 01:48.714
She fled a life

01:48.714 --> 01:52.117
of confinement to live
unchained and unfettered,

01:53.018 --> 01:54.953
plundering the South China Sea,

01:56.088 --> 01:57.756
where she formed a new family,

01:59.458 --> 02:02.228
a loyal crew of women she
saved from the shackles

02:02.228 --> 02:04.497
of servitude or title.

02:16.074 --> 02:17.943
it was on the high seas
she forged a friendship

02:17.943 --> 02:21.013
with a notorious
pirate, Red Cat Morgan.

02:22.481 --> 02:24.617
Together, they ruled the
waves, becoming each other's

02:24.617 --> 02:26.252
only true ally,

02:27.586 --> 02:29.822
but their past was
never far behind.

02:31.190 --> 02:34.827
Victims of their ravage, hell
bent on tracking them down,

02:34.827 --> 02:37.196
wanting retribution in blood.

02:40.199 --> 02:42.501
When her pursuers
eventually closed in,

02:42.501 --> 02:45.438
Marshanda entrusted her
share of the riches to Red,

02:45.438 --> 02:48.974
who in turn gave her a wrist
device that would lead her back

02:48.974 --> 02:50.776
to Red and the treasure.

02:52.211 --> 02:55.781
She then headed towards the
frozen waters of the Antarctic,

02:55.781 --> 02:57.983
so desperate to escape
that she went somewhere

02:57.983 --> 03:00.085
no one would dare follow.

03:00.085 --> 03:03.489
But tragically, her ship
was lost to the ice,

03:04.757 --> 03:08.461
lost for hundreds
of years until now.

04:48.527 --> 04:50.262
Up here,

04:50.262 --> 04:54.567
Stuart, we have one of
those homeless again.

04:58.904 --> 04:59.772
Get Mr. Walsh

04:59.772 --> 05:01.006
down here immediately.

05:05.310 --> 05:06.211
Hey!

05:14.887 --> 05:16.422
Get her out of here!

05:17.390 --> 05:19.958
Get the boss! Get Mr Walsh!

05:25.598 --> 05:28.767
Daddy, she's hungry, catch.

05:41.814 --> 05:44.216
She did not pay
for that spring roll.

05:44.216 --> 05:46.485
Tase her, Gary.

06:39.171 --> 06:41.106
Mia, Mia.

06:42.475 --> 06:43.408
Mia.

06:44.777 --> 06:46.344
Those toilets is blocked again,

06:46.344 --> 06:50.248
and I've got a big meeting with
this finance tosser Collins.

06:50.248 --> 06:51.684
He's in the bar
waiting right now

06:51.684 --> 06:53.452
and the timing's terrible.

06:54.820 --> 06:57.856
You know, sometimes
I think it's a sign.

06:57.856 --> 07:00.726
You know, sometimes I think
you want me to lose this bar.

07:04.329 --> 07:05.230
Hmm?

07:07.700 --> 07:09.868
Fine, I'll do
it, give it here.

07:09.868 --> 07:12.538
Oh, I love the way
you unblock a toilet.

07:12.538 --> 07:13.438
Ew.

07:31.289 --> 07:32.190
Sorry, sorry.

07:34.927 --> 07:35.828
What is,

07:42.067 --> 07:45.070
I don't speak, I'm really sorry,

07:45.070 --> 07:46.739
listen, I don't,
I'm from Croydon.

07:49.542 --> 07:50.976
Do you know Croydon?

07:56.181 --> 07:58.316
You're hiding from
someone, is that it?

07:59.785 --> 08:01.620
It's going to be okay.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.662
Excuse me.

08:09.662 --> 08:11.830
Did you see a woman run
through this way just now?

08:11.830 --> 08:13.031
- A lady in the medical gown?
- Yes.

08:13.031 --> 08:15.534
Yeah, she shoved
me and went that way.

08:15.534 --> 08:17.636
She just left, you might
still be able to catch her.

08:17.636 --> 08:19.605
Thank
you, Thank you.

08:19.605 --> 08:21.139
Police!

08:21.139 --> 08:22.407
That was so exciting,

08:22.407 --> 08:23.976
I've never lied to
the police before.

08:24.810 --> 08:26.278
Oh crap,

08:26.278 --> 08:28.647
are you an escaped killer
on a violent rampage?

08:31.650 --> 08:33.518
Oh, let's just get you inside.

08:33.518 --> 08:36.188
There's food inside, food.

08:38.891 --> 08:40.893
I have an idea.

08:40.893 --> 08:42.360
Here, take this.

08:43.161 --> 08:44.062
Catch.

08:45.430 --> 08:47.465
Wait, wait, no, no, no,
no, I promise, wait, wait.

08:47.465 --> 08:51.469
More, good, good,
look, mmm, mmm, good.

08:51.469 --> 08:52.671
Oh, no, no, don't, don't.

09:03.649 --> 09:06.885
You want another one,
you got it, that's it.

09:13.859 --> 09:15.027
This guy, he didn't do anything,

09:15.027 --> 09:16.461
just gave vague promises.

09:17.996 --> 09:19.732
Hey, it's okay.

09:25.070 --> 09:26.739
Time to distract Eddie.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.949
- Eddie!
- Where you been?

09:38.050 --> 09:41.486
The toilets are blocked,
don't worry about it.

09:41.486 --> 09:44.556
Oh, careful, oh my
God, Eddie, come on.

10:36.775 --> 10:39.878
State of that shitty bar,
make it yourself, did ya?

11:07.205 --> 11:08.774
Yeah, I like it, too.

11:08.774 --> 11:10.608
It's Skip's great, great, no,

11:10.608 --> 11:13.712
great, great, great, great,
great, great grandfather

11:13.712 --> 11:15.313
had a commission or something.

11:18.683 --> 11:21.987
You all right, Benny?

11:36.534 --> 11:38.771
Mia, can I trouble
you for another?

11:38.771 --> 11:40.005
Yeah, of course.

11:40.005 --> 11:41.840
Hey, how's sick leave going?

11:41.840 --> 11:42.908
Oh, you know,

11:44.376 --> 11:47.612
another day on the right side
of the grass and oh, lovely,

11:47.612 --> 11:49.614
let me keep the box.

11:50.816 --> 11:52.851
Very nice, fair
do's hey, the usual?

11:52.851 --> 11:54.319
Oh, yes, please.

11:54.319 --> 11:55.553
Eddie made me something called

11:55.553 --> 12:00.125
discharge of the
light brigade, ugh.

12:00.125 --> 12:01.593
No worries, leave it with me.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.612
We need to get you
unhooked from this taser.

12:20.612 --> 12:23.081
This is gonna suck, but, hey.

12:31.790 --> 12:35.060
I'm sorry, I think I understood
that and I'm really, really,

12:35.060 --> 12:38.663
I'm really sorry, I'm so
sorry. I'm so sorry, bear with.

12:39.764 --> 12:42.700
I'm so sorry, bear with,
bear with, breathe.

12:44.069 --> 12:46.438
Let's get you into something
a little less conspicuous.

12:51.143 --> 12:51.944
Looks good.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.313
Let's see.

12:59.651 --> 13:01.253
It's amazing what people
leave behind in pubs

13:01.253 --> 13:02.720
after a few pints, honestly.

13:04.389 --> 13:07.692
These look like they'll
fit, so try these on.

13:15.033 --> 13:17.569
Okay, let's get you some
real food, all right.

13:17.569 --> 13:21.106
What do you fancy, scampi
fries, beef crisps?

13:21.106 --> 13:23.508
Are you vegetarian,
because that's all we have?

13:26.678 --> 13:29.181
Right, you might
be a mass murderer

13:29.181 --> 13:31.149
and I'm here asking about
your dietary requirements.

13:31.149 --> 13:33.418
I'm an idiot, okay,
please stay, all right,

13:33.418 --> 13:34.419
I'll be right back.

13:38.590 --> 13:41.293
Hey, hey, ready
yourselves for another

13:41.293 --> 13:44.829
delightful concoction from
London's greatest mixologist.

13:44.829 --> 13:48.533
I call this one, angel jizz.

13:48.533 --> 13:52.037
Welcome explorers to
the Smugglers Tavern,

13:52.037 --> 13:54.973
the pirate's private
party palace.

13:54.973 --> 13:58.410
This is the most historically
infamous sordid den

13:58.410 --> 14:00.078
of villainy and
underworld chicanery

14:00.078 --> 14:02.514
that ever was in
old London town.

14:02.514 --> 14:04.149
And it's here our
walking tour of London

14:04.149 --> 14:07.986
shall pause for refreshments
and use of the facilities.

14:07.986 --> 14:10.288
Mine's a Brandy Alexander
if anyone's buying.

14:11.523 --> 14:12.424
No?

14:13.225 --> 14:14.126
No?

14:15.894 --> 14:17.129
Fair enough.

14:29.574 --> 14:32.911
Argh, froze banana, bone sack.

14:36.114 --> 14:37.849
I need to talk to step
to Skip about our deal.

14:37.849 --> 14:38.750
He's busy.

14:39.884 --> 14:42.387
- Just get him.
- I just said he's busy.

14:42.387 --> 14:43.288
Please.

15:04.909 --> 15:07.579
- I'm not selling.
- Mr. Walsh is offering--

15:07.579 --> 15:08.746
I'm not selling!

15:10.082 --> 15:11.583
I know it's been
in your family for generations,

15:11.583 --> 15:16.221
- but you need to think about--
- I will not change my mind.

15:16.221 --> 15:18.590
Fine, Mr. Walsh
won't be happy.

15:23.895 --> 15:26.931
Hey, look, I know you're
really doing everything you can

15:26.931 --> 15:28.700
to help out, but is
there anything you can do

15:28.700 --> 15:30.868
to just help out
a little bit more?

15:32.204 --> 15:34.606
Well, if he doesn't pay
any of you this month,

15:34.606 --> 15:38.610
he might just scrape by,
but what about next month?

15:40.412 --> 15:42.547
Hey, don't worry.

15:42.547 --> 15:46.051
You can always be a
barmaid somewhere else.

15:46.051 --> 15:47.719
It's not the only pub in London.

16:18.116 --> 16:20.118
Eddie will
be with you shortly.

16:22.087 --> 16:23.255
Skip is missing his cue.

16:23.255 --> 16:24.522
He's in the
middle of something.

16:24.522 --> 16:26.224
Shit, here, tell
this lovely girl,

16:26.224 --> 16:27.459
- Woman.
- Woman, about

16:27.459 --> 16:29.761
the dastardly dealings
of the Smugglers Tavern.

16:30.995 --> 16:33.998
We do two for one cocktails
between now and six.

16:33.998 --> 16:34.899
Nice.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.701
Cocktails.

16:39.671 --> 16:42.474
Actually, let me go find
this general knowledge expert

16:42.474 --> 16:44.076
who knows a lot more than I do.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.845
Lots of the legends
here are true,

16:47.845 --> 16:51.049
it's a most
mysterious place this.

16:52.184 --> 16:55.420
Before the great
fire, it was 1666,

16:56.821 --> 17:01.693
lots of nefarious stuff, and
right here, I mean this bar,

17:02.794 --> 17:06.331
it's built right on
top of the lost rivers

17:06.331 --> 17:11.403
and caves of London, all lost

17:12.470 --> 17:14.406
when they rebuilt
post-fire apparently.

17:20.378 --> 17:24.082
To reach your destination,
you must leave the shore.

17:24.082 --> 17:28.052
Ah, yes, the maxim
of ferocious pirate Catherine Morgan,

17:28.052 --> 17:29.887
or Red Cat, as she was known.

17:29.887 --> 17:32.056
Oh yeah, because
she had nine lives,

17:39.631 --> 17:41.433
Cat
discovered a baby kraken

17:41.433 --> 17:43.135
orphaned from its mother.

17:43.135 --> 17:47.472
She cared for this
krakling, naming her Lucy,

17:47.472 --> 17:51.243
a fierce protector of the
pirate who raised her.

18:11.429 --> 18:13.798
Red Cat spent years
trying to find a friend,

18:13.798 --> 18:16.701
eventually Cat turned up here.

18:16.701 --> 18:19.070
Her last hope was that
her friend would follow

18:19.070 --> 18:21.973
in her footsteps to the
infamous Smugglers Tavern,

18:21.973 --> 18:25.243
known as a black market for
trading pillaged riches.

18:26.544 --> 18:29.281
Allegedly, she left
a trail of clues

18:29.281 --> 18:32.417
should Marshanda return
to claim her share

18:32.417 --> 18:36.588
before Cat herself became
nothing more than legend.

18:41.159 --> 18:44.028
The man being shot by Red
Cat in the painting bears

18:44.028 --> 18:46.864
a likeness to Skip's
forefather who owned the tavern

18:46.864 --> 18:50.034
at the time, leading many
to believe Skip's family

18:50.034 --> 18:52.003
were more involved
in the sordid deeds

18:52.003 --> 18:54.406
of this notorious
pirate than we know.

18:57.542 --> 19:01.813
Cool, I'll take two of
those cocktails please.

19:01.813 --> 19:03.815
Kraken, it's a nice touch.

19:03.815 --> 19:06.318
I actually love the kraken.

19:25.570 --> 19:27.305
I hope you enjoy
daylong sci-fi sessions

19:27.305 --> 19:29.641
with an unwashed flacid ape man.

19:29.641 --> 19:31.142
He feeds off
self-esteem, this one,

19:31.142 --> 19:32.610
so I'd look out for that, yeah.

19:32.610 --> 19:33.911
Hey, Eddie, can
you pass me a water?

19:33.911 --> 19:35.079
Hey, check this out.

19:35.079 --> 19:36.814
See this fool over there?

19:36.814 --> 19:39.951
So she used to date him

19:41.219 --> 19:42.554
and it looks like
they've dragged new dates

19:42.554 --> 19:43.755
to the same place.

19:47.024 --> 19:48.526
Why don't you kick
this date into phase two

19:48.526 --> 19:49.927
and just shit off to Nando's.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.796
You shit off to
Nando's, you ponce.

19:52.564 --> 19:53.931
Eddie, the water.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.236
Thank you.

19:58.236 --> 20:01.172
Oh, hey, They've called down,

20:01.172 --> 20:03.908
delivery's waiting, been up
there for about 10 minutes.

20:03.908 --> 20:05.377
10 minute, ugh.

20:08.079 --> 20:10.114
You can stick your apology.

20:21.693 --> 20:23.728
Hey, well done, another
delivery's been nicked.

20:23.728 --> 20:25.196
This one's on you, Eddie.

20:25.196 --> 20:27.365
Come on, don't
be like that, Mia.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.536
Skip, Eddie did not--

20:37.575 --> 20:39.277
Run, Mia, run!

21:48.913 --> 21:50.615
Are you all right
down there, Skip?

21:51.516 --> 21:53.317
I think so.

21:53.317 --> 21:55.119
Call an ambulance, Eddie.

22:05.630 --> 22:07.932
Hey, don't kill him, don't.

22:10.468 --> 22:11.969
Ya.

22:11.969 --> 22:12.870
Ya.

22:32.890 --> 22:36.127
That was the same crest as
the restaurant next door.

22:36.127 --> 22:37.829
Hey, what does this mean?

22:46.037 --> 22:48.139
Her vocal sound obliterated,
that's not healthy.

22:48.139 --> 22:50.174
Sounds like you've been
doing eight Phantoms a week.

22:50.174 --> 22:51.709
That's serious.

22:51.709 --> 22:52.510
I can fix this.

22:54.278 --> 22:55.146
Skip!

22:56.414 --> 22:57.849
Oh, hey, you
can't be back here.

22:57.849 --> 23:00.685
Yep, just knocking together
a cheeky vocal tonic.

23:00.685 --> 23:03.387
Eddie, they cut the landline
before roughing me up.

23:03.387 --> 23:06.991
That's another thing
I, ow, to pay for.

23:06.991 --> 23:07.892
Oh yeah?

23:10.495 --> 23:11.729
See, if I was 15 years younger,

23:11.729 --> 23:14.098
I'd throw you about like
an empty track suit.

23:15.032 --> 23:15.933
What's this?

23:18.903 --> 23:23.941
Gun powder and this is
why you can't be back here.

23:24.842 --> 23:26.110
All right.

23:30.948 --> 23:32.884
Hey, you're a bright bulb,

23:32.884 --> 23:34.919
maybe you can communicate
with her, what's she saying?

23:34.919 --> 23:36.521
I'll see what I can do.

23:36.521 --> 23:38.189
Wanna get some ice on that.

23:38.189 --> 23:39.824
There's no signal down here.

23:39.824 --> 23:41.358
- I know.
- Right, I'll go up

23:41.358 --> 23:42.694
and call the police.

23:49.734 --> 23:51.836
I don't think the
police can help her.

23:51.836 --> 23:53.104
What is she looking for?

23:55.607 --> 23:57.542
Hey, who were those guys?

23:59.911 --> 24:03.080
Just some people who want
to cash in on Mummy's fortune.

24:04.749 --> 24:07.284
I can't even afford
to keep the lights on

24:08.586 --> 24:10.655
and they can smell the
blood in the water.

24:11.956 --> 24:13.758
So I'm gonna have to sell.

24:16.628 --> 24:18.462
I let my father down.

24:20.031 --> 24:22.700
I can help you,
I've been saving up.

24:22.700 --> 24:26.337
Oh, Mia, no, I
can't do that again.

24:26.337 --> 24:28.105
Yes, please, yes you can.

24:28.105 --> 24:30.474
It's fine, you can owe me.

24:30.474 --> 24:31.943
I can't.

24:31.943 --> 24:35.379
- Skip, please, it's fine.
- Mia, no.

24:36.781 --> 24:38.182
It's only a bar.

24:39.083 --> 24:40.317
It's a home.

24:42.119 --> 24:43.020
I can't.

24:44.355 --> 24:45.256
I can't.

24:50.061 --> 24:51.195
It's not up to you.

24:52.063 --> 24:53.598
I'm gonna help you.

24:54.766 --> 24:56.500
I won't be needing
this anytime soon.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.169
So much for traveling the world.

24:59.436 --> 25:00.337
Come on, you.

25:06.778 --> 25:09.013
Okay, let's see how get
this translation app is.

25:09.013 --> 25:11.015
You're welcome.

25:13.685 --> 25:17.321
Language not recognized.

25:19.123 --> 25:21.993
- See if you can translate.
- Do your thing.

25:26.097 --> 25:27.865
Who are you?

25:27.865 --> 25:29.967
- Marshanda Damayanti.
- Marshanda?

25:29.967 --> 25:32.369
- Marshanda.
- I'm Mia.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.171
Mia.

25:34.171 --> 25:35.807
- Mia.
- Yes, Mia.

25:35.807 --> 25:36.708
Marshanda.

25:38.409 --> 25:42.346
Sod this shithole,
ladies to champers.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.919
The police
are on their way.

25:50.454 --> 25:52.724
Danger.

25:52.724 --> 25:54.726
Danger.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.763
Hey, police are gonna
be here in a little bit.

25:58.763 --> 26:00.397
And I don't want my
friend to get in trouble.

26:00.397 --> 26:02.466
Can she come with you
just for a short while?

26:02.466 --> 26:04.736
I'll come find her and
drinks will be on me.

26:04.736 --> 26:06.570
Abso-bloody-lutely.

26:07.939 --> 26:09.106
Tell her
that she needs to go

26:09.106 --> 26:11.375
and I'll come find her then.

26:14.746 --> 26:16.180
Go.

26:16.180 --> 26:18.349
She'll be safe with us.

26:22.319 --> 26:25.189
None of you saw
her, especially you.

26:28.225 --> 26:31.128
I'm not supposed to go
anywhere until the police.

26:31.128 --> 26:32.730
I will buy you shots.

26:32.730 --> 26:34.365
I will get you to, stop,

26:34.365 --> 26:35.833
they're surprisingly strong.

26:39.103 --> 26:41.272
Oh, no, no, no, go, go.

26:43.775 --> 26:45.442
Go on then.

26:45.442 --> 26:47.578
I can't.

26:51.615 --> 26:53.718
I can't leave them.

26:59.623 --> 27:01.458
No, wait, what you doing?

27:03.327 --> 27:07.398
- Did you call the police?
- Yes, yes, I did.

27:07.398 --> 27:09.967
And they are coming
to take statements

27:09.967 --> 27:13.805
so everyone needs to stay here.

27:13.805 --> 27:16.841
- What about the ambulance?
- Yeah, ambulance too.

27:16.841 --> 27:19.376
We can't have the
police coming here.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.912
Huh, why not?

27:20.912 --> 27:24.615
Marshanda, she might be
running from something, I think.

27:24.615 --> 27:27.551
- For what?
- What is she looking for?

27:29.486 --> 27:32.156
Look, why is she looking?

27:32.156 --> 27:33.858
I don't know, until
I figure that one out,

27:33.858 --> 27:36.460
let's maybe not throw her
under the bus, all right.

27:36.460 --> 27:37.661
The thing on the wrist,

27:41.365 --> 27:43.434
this crest, what is it?

27:45.937 --> 27:48.505
That crest is
ancient and it's been

27:48.505 --> 27:51.475
in that building upstairs long
before it was a restaurant.

27:54.078 --> 27:55.813
They've been trying
to buy me out

27:56.881 --> 27:58.482
and they'll try
anything to burn me.

27:59.583 --> 28:03.788
Look, I'm sorry,
but keep this quiet,

28:03.788 --> 28:06.290
they've put a bid
in for this place.

28:06.290 --> 28:08.860
It's three times what
the place is worth.

28:08.860 --> 28:11.262
Maybe she's involved with them.

28:11.262 --> 28:12.163
No, no.

28:13.630 --> 28:15.232
She's not with them.

28:17.401 --> 28:19.470
Then keep her out of sight.

28:21.338 --> 28:23.374
What makes you think this
is going well, I don't--

28:23.374 --> 28:25.376
No, no, no, absolutely.
We'll just, we'll start again.

28:25.376 --> 28:26.510
Me and Chloe.

28:26.510 --> 28:27.745
Get your mucky
hands off of me.

28:27.745 --> 28:30.815
No, no, the police
said not to leave.

28:32.016 --> 28:33.484
Help me out.

28:35.419 --> 28:36.320
Mia,

28:38.189 --> 28:39.090
help me out.

28:50.701 --> 28:52.636
- Hello, Matt.
- Mr. Walsh,

28:52.636 --> 28:54.171
fancy seeing you here.

28:54.171 --> 28:58.042
This is DC Cross, been a bit
of a disturbance in the area.

28:58.042 --> 29:00.878
I just wanted to check our
lovely neighbors were all right.

29:03.881 --> 29:05.049
Go, go, there.

29:05.049 --> 29:07.151
In here, go, in
here, stay, you stay.

29:07.151 --> 29:08.419
No, no, you gotta stay and hide.

29:08.419 --> 29:09.854
We need to keep
you out of sight.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.376
Well, it looks
like our suspect

29:32.376 --> 29:35.612
committed similar
acts on your premises.

29:35.612 --> 29:39.516
- Yo, Skip, who is this guy?
- Theodore Walsh.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.318
He inherited the
restaurant from his father

29:41.318 --> 29:43.687
and also acquired his
lust for this place.

29:43.687 --> 29:46.858
Call me Ted,
actually no, Mr. Walsh.

29:46.858 --> 29:51.262
My associate believes
our suspect is here,

29:52.529 --> 29:54.531
my niece.

29:56.467 --> 29:57.835
Your niece?

29:59.370 --> 30:02.206
We are just concerned.

30:09.213 --> 30:11.916
Well, maybe we should just
wait for the police, eh,

30:11.916 --> 30:13.184
sort this all out.

30:14.952 --> 30:17.621
But we are the police anyway.

30:19.756 --> 30:20.992
You got any id?

30:22.459 --> 30:24.228
Isn't that how you
do things here?

30:25.262 --> 30:26.163
Come here.

30:30.434 --> 30:31.835
Look at my face.

30:33.204 --> 30:35.306
This is all the ID you need.

30:35.306 --> 30:37.174
Take a good long look.

30:38.275 --> 30:39.310
There we go.

30:47.051 --> 30:48.552
So your niece?

30:48.552 --> 30:49.586
Yes,

30:50.922 --> 30:54.458
hospital gown, violent,
quite the character,

30:54.458 --> 30:56.961
a troubled young
woman, I have to say.

30:56.961 --> 30:58.129
We were in the
process of getting her

30:58.129 --> 31:01.165
some assistance,
psychiatric assistance.

31:01.165 --> 31:03.500
She had an episode, ran away,

31:04.801 --> 31:06.037
millennials.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.808
Your niece,

31:15.579 --> 31:16.513
you're her uncle?

31:17.681 --> 31:19.483
- Yes.
- And this lot?

31:20.918 --> 31:22.353
They're your task force?

31:22.353 --> 31:23.520
Uncle.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.656
- We're also uncle.
- Also uncle.

31:28.659 --> 31:29.560
Big family.

31:33.664 --> 31:35.166
More police are on the way.

31:36.000 --> 31:36.968
Are they?

31:42.373 --> 31:44.108
We were just trying to leave.

31:45.309 --> 31:46.710
Hi, we have a
schedule to keep.

31:48.879 --> 31:51.848
Hey, don't touch me.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.422
Relax.

31:58.422 --> 32:00.824
Let's all have some drinks,
that's why we're here, right?

32:01.792 --> 32:03.294
All we need is the woman.

32:04.161 --> 32:05.062
Where is she?

32:11.502 --> 32:14.538
She was here, Mr. Walsh.

32:15.672 --> 32:17.741
I don't know where
she is currently.

32:21.178 --> 32:22.079
Whoops.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.348
I'll get those up.

32:24.348 --> 32:25.549
Let's try again.

32:58.482 --> 32:59.950
Well, look who it is.

32:59.950 --> 33:02.486
Come on, darling.

33:12.963 --> 33:15.632
Why were you hiding in there?

33:23.807 --> 33:24.708
Mia,

33:25.609 --> 33:28.045
these men are dangerous.

33:29.480 --> 33:30.447
No, stop.

33:32.015 --> 33:33.417
See.

33:33.417 --> 33:35.952
Wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:42.659 --> 33:45.162
Mister, I'm not who
you're looking for.

33:45.162 --> 33:46.263
Mr. Walsh.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.234
Mr. Walsh,

33:50.234 --> 33:52.103
I think I might have seen them

33:52.103 --> 33:54.238
going into the toilets together.

33:57.007 --> 33:58.542
She might still be in there.

34:04.415 --> 34:06.016
Made a new friend today.

34:07.484 --> 34:08.385
Hmm?

34:10.020 --> 34:11.955
I wonder what you
both talked about.

34:45.989 --> 34:46.890
Mia.

35:10.347 --> 35:12.249
Told you she was
there, Boss, that's her.

35:12.249 --> 35:13.150
Oh yes.

35:21.492 --> 35:24.895
I want you all outta my bar.

35:36.039 --> 35:37.708
Eddie, the glass.

35:48.385 --> 35:49.453
Right now!

36:03.634 --> 36:07.037
Now, now.

36:08.872 --> 36:10.574
Do you wanna see
if this thing works?

36:10.574 --> 36:12.509
Or do you wanna get
the fuck outta here?

36:15.846 --> 36:17.481
Get back, get back!

36:17.481 --> 36:19.015
Take both the girls.

37:09.099 --> 37:10.567
I've been shot.

37:13.169 --> 37:14.905
What is this shit?

37:17.073 --> 37:17.974
Sorry.

37:20.043 --> 37:20.944
Clear

37:21.912 --> 37:24.114
my browser history.

37:27.884 --> 37:29.420
C'est la vie.

37:29.420 --> 37:31.021
That's life.

37:31.855 --> 37:32.756
Sorry.

37:34.925 --> 37:36.493
Bring her to me,

37:37.994 --> 37:39.730
no witnesses,

37:39.730 --> 37:41.632
kill them all.

38:40.957 --> 38:42.292
What is that?

38:43.594 --> 38:45.228
That's where the Morgans
went centuries ago,

38:45.228 --> 38:46.129
you know that's gonna be.

38:46.129 --> 38:47.498
- A way out?
- Yes.

38:47.498 --> 38:49.833
Something's
better than nothing.

39:01.211 --> 39:02.946
Let's go.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.287
Let's play catch.

39:23.066 --> 39:24.435
Eddie!

39:26.803 --> 39:28.038
No, no, Eddie.

39:33.276 --> 39:35.479
No.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.895
It's going to be,

41:01.431 --> 41:03.099
It's going to be okay,
we'll get you help.

41:03.099 --> 41:05.869
We'll get everything
sorted, the help you need.

41:07.270 --> 41:10.006
There's a way out underground.

41:11.074 --> 41:13.544
Oh no, I'm not
leaving you behind.

41:15.712 --> 41:19.415
The Orlop River, the Orlop,

41:19.415 --> 41:21.217
What do you mean
the Orlop River?

41:23.219 --> 41:25.388
Skip, no.

41:25.388 --> 41:26.456
The Orlop.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.996
Go see what's in there for me.

42:07.598 --> 42:08.999
No, thank you, Mr. Walsh.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.101
We should leave.

42:14.605 --> 42:15.505
Okay.

42:21.111 --> 42:23.179
- Gang warfare.
- What do we do?

42:32.889 --> 42:34.090
There has to be a way out.

42:34.090 --> 42:35.726
Hey, you two, with
me now, come on.

42:36.627 --> 42:37.560
No.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.729
She works here, come on.

42:49.405 --> 42:51.574
Guys, there's
another room back here.

42:56.312 --> 42:57.714
Come on, let's go.

42:58.615 --> 43:00.250
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

43:04.888 --> 43:09.960
Marshanda, come on, let's go.

43:10.794 --> 43:12.262
Help me.

43:17.734 --> 43:18.635
Come on.

43:25.208 --> 43:26.109
Go!

43:27.377 --> 43:30.546
No, Benny, Benny,
come on, come on!

43:47.764 --> 43:49.399
This is your doing!

43:58.408 --> 44:01.077
The girl's in here
with me, Mr. Walsh.

44:01.077 --> 44:02.578
Why do they want her?

44:02.578 --> 44:04.180
Don't know.

44:04.180 --> 44:05.115
How long have you worked here

44:05.115 --> 44:06.382
and not had access to this room?

44:06.382 --> 44:08.752
I had no idea this was
here until a minute ago.

44:08.752 --> 44:12.255
Do you think these are
access points to fix the pipes?

44:12.255 --> 44:13.389
Well, who cares?

44:44.154 --> 44:45.822
You shot me!

44:56.566 --> 44:58.234
I need a doctor!

45:02.572 --> 45:03.940
How many muskets?

45:03.940 --> 45:06.409
Muskets, god that
app needs updating.

45:06.409 --> 45:08.979
Yes, muskets, very bad.

45:11.848 --> 45:13.349
What do they want with her?

45:14.317 --> 45:16.019
There's nowhere to run.

45:16.019 --> 45:18.654
You should--

45:22.492 --> 45:24.527
- Orlop River.
- River?

45:26.129 --> 45:29.065
You think this pipe leads
to one of the sunken rivers?

45:29.065 --> 45:30.600
Orlop river , Skip said..

45:30.600 --> 45:33.003
You lot need to get your
priorities straight there.

45:33.003 --> 45:34.838
There is no Orlop River.

45:34.838 --> 45:37.808
Nearest sunken river's
the Tiburn or something.

45:39.542 --> 45:41.111
Might as well just give it up.

45:42.578 --> 45:44.080
Orlop.

45:44.080 --> 45:47.851
Orlop is the lowest part of
a ship of the rogue sea cats.

45:47.851 --> 45:50.586
- Skip said Orlop River, but,
- It could be a way out.

46:01.932 --> 46:07.003
Look, is there anything we
can do to keep your boss happy?

46:11.407 --> 46:14.010
Well, they're obviously
looking for what?

46:16.847 --> 46:19.482
Something Cat Morgan
brought down here

46:19.482 --> 46:21.184
hundreds of years ago.

46:21.184 --> 46:22.085
Red Cat Morgan?

46:26.556 --> 46:28.658
Are you talking about
Red Cat's treasure?

46:30.726 --> 46:31.794
That's just a myth.

46:43.339 --> 46:45.141
Your phone, can
you translate this?

46:48.511 --> 46:50.613
Language not found.

46:50.613 --> 46:52.983
It's not a
language in the app.

46:52.983 --> 46:54.517
Maybe you can have
her say something

46:54.517 --> 46:56.086
and it'll translate that.

46:56.086 --> 46:57.153
Can you read this?

46:58.654 --> 46:59.555
Read it.

47:04.627 --> 47:09.232
To destination
advance, coast departure urgent.

47:09.232 --> 47:11.902
No, no, no, I think I get it.

47:11.902 --> 47:14.537
It's Red's motto written
in some coded language.

47:16.106 --> 47:17.440
Skip said follow the Orlop River

47:17.440 --> 47:19.809
and this pipes say
Orlop steel on it.

47:19.809 --> 47:22.412
I think Cat, Red Cat must
have left that painting

47:22.412 --> 47:25.015
for someone and Marshanda
knows something about it.

47:26.616 --> 47:28.518
I bet whatever they're
after is through this pipe

47:28.518 --> 47:30.753
and Skip realized it
when he saw the hatch.

47:32.088 --> 47:33.256
Let's try and find it.

47:34.424 --> 47:35.391
Let's try and find it, yeah.

47:35.391 --> 47:36.960
And we can give it to your boss,

47:36.960 --> 47:39.429
you can smooth things
over, buy some time,

47:39.429 --> 47:40.663
and we'll keep running.

47:42.165 --> 47:43.433
You're safe.

47:43.433 --> 47:44.700
We are safe.

47:45.535 --> 47:47.103
Right?

48:08.524 --> 48:09.825
Up that way, right?

48:11.394 --> 48:13.696
I really can't do this.

48:18.301 --> 48:19.202
Ah!

48:20.403 --> 48:21.737
Save yourselves.

48:21.737 --> 48:23.206
Stop showing off!

48:31.214 --> 48:32.115
Quick.

48:54.537 --> 48:57.840
Boss, the room's
empty, they've disappeared.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.876
All right, I need a,

49:00.876 --> 49:04.814
well, well, well,
what have we here?

49:05.681 --> 49:06.849
Now what is

49:06.849 --> 49:08.118
the deal with that room?

49:09.585 --> 49:12.055
how would I know, I've
never been in there?

49:12.055 --> 49:16.026
And besides, I'm way too hench
to fit through that shit.

49:16.026 --> 49:18.061
You saying I'm
not hench enough?

49:18.061 --> 49:20.096
It's a fucking hatch,
what do you want?

49:20.096 --> 49:23.566
Good point, what
we want is the girl

49:23.566 --> 49:25.168
and more specifically
something she has,

49:25.168 --> 49:28.071
a little wrist device, and
what she can find with it.

49:28.071 --> 49:30.506
But the chief concern is
where they could have gone

49:30.506 --> 49:32.042
because they're not in there.

49:33.543 --> 49:36.846
I think this one
may be able to work it out.

49:36.846 --> 49:37.780
Me?

49:37.780 --> 49:39.815
What makes you think that?

49:39.815 --> 49:41.184
Call it a hunch.

49:48.524 --> 49:49.492
It's not my hat.

50:01.304 --> 50:02.772
Come on.

50:07.843 --> 50:09.745
Come on, get on with it.

50:10.646 --> 50:12.315
Get on with what?

50:13.116 --> 50:14.217
Where'd they go?

50:17.687 --> 50:21.091
There's a secret door
in here or something.

50:22.992 --> 50:23.893
Find it.

50:44.414 --> 50:46.349
Keep moving.

50:46.349 --> 50:48.118
We're getting there.

50:48.118 --> 50:49.419
Getting where?

50:50.320 --> 50:53.523
All the way from the bad guys.

50:53.523 --> 50:54.657
Yeah, right.

50:56.826 --> 50:59.462
- Come on.
- Don't push me, stop.

51:06.569 --> 51:07.470
Go, go.

51:09.472 --> 51:11.441
No, no, no, no, no, no.

51:47.243 --> 51:48.110
Well, shit.

51:50.079 --> 51:51.381
He's done it.

51:51.381 --> 51:53.349
He's found a little escape room.

52:02.158 --> 52:05.428
Oh God, no, stop pushing me.

52:05.428 --> 52:06.329
I'm stuck!

52:08.531 --> 52:09.432
Stop!

52:27.583 --> 52:29.452
Don't, no, no, please.

52:29.452 --> 52:30.353
Hey.

52:33.956 --> 52:34.890
What's going on,
why did we stop,

52:34.890 --> 52:35.825
and why are the light out?

52:35.825 --> 52:36.859
Someone talk to me, please.

52:36.859 --> 52:37.760
No!

52:48.103 --> 52:49.672
Oh, I'm gonna die.

52:53.243 --> 52:54.043
Breathe.

53:00.316 --> 53:02.518
Oh shit, breathe, breathe.

53:20.470 --> 53:22.037
Here, take this.

53:26.242 --> 53:27.577
It's a penis.

53:35.918 --> 53:36.919
She's gone.

53:39.355 --> 53:42.258
The American girl's gone.

53:42.258 --> 53:43.158
Hello?

53:44.627 --> 53:46.195
Somebody's coming.

53:50.032 --> 53:51.601
Somebody's coming.

53:55.971 --> 53:56.939
You good?

53:58.574 --> 53:59.842
I found a way out.

53:59.842 --> 54:00.676
It's crazy cool.

54:03.813 --> 54:05.981
It's not mine, sorry.

54:06.816 --> 54:08.351
It doesn't mean anything.

54:22.832 --> 54:26.168
Which way?

54:26.168 --> 54:30.573
We're getting closer, they
definitely came this way.

55:02.438 --> 55:04.273
All this is under the bar?

55:04.273 --> 55:07.710
Under the bar and so far
back we are no longer in Soho.

55:07.710 --> 55:09.178
It is nice shit.

55:10.746 --> 55:12.782
Skips Dad knew
about this place.

55:16.185 --> 55:18.388
I heard voices, they're coming.

55:22.625 --> 55:23.926
The way out's that way.

55:24.894 --> 55:26.429
Well let's move, yeah.

55:26.429 --> 55:29.432
If they catch us, we're dead.

55:29.432 --> 55:31.200
Someone's been
paying attention.

55:33.135 --> 55:34.203
Follow the breeze.

55:41.611 --> 55:42.512
Hang on.

55:45.314 --> 55:46.281
Your translation app.

55:49.485 --> 55:50.753
It's still looking.

55:50.753 --> 55:53.288
- During, let's move.
- We can't hang about.

55:53.288 --> 55:54.824
One second.

55:55.758 --> 55:57.693
I need to go this way.

55:57.693 --> 55:58.528
Oh, no, no, no, we
need to get out here,

55:58.528 --> 55:59.662
it's too dangerous.

56:01.030 --> 56:04.033
Danger.

56:08.904 --> 56:11.073
- What do we do?
- I'm sticking with her

56:11.073 --> 56:13.142
but if you wanna go, you can go.

56:14.009 --> 56:15.010
I'll stay with you guys.

56:15.010 --> 56:16.211
Seems safer.

56:16.211 --> 56:18.748
What are we doing
hanging about, come on.

56:18.748 --> 56:19.649
It's that way.

56:20.950 --> 56:23.385
You said follow the breeze.

56:23.385 --> 56:25.120
The breeze is that way.

56:25.120 --> 56:28.891
You're following the
echo of the breeze.

56:28.891 --> 56:31.293
The echo of the breeze,
makes sense to me.

56:48.143 --> 56:49.945
Marshanda, slow down.

56:56.619 --> 56:57.520
Marshanda!

57:52.542 --> 57:55.044
Try again in Mandarin.

57:55.044 --> 57:58.514
My sister, my friend.

57:58.514 --> 58:00.583
My friend.

58:00.583 --> 58:03.553
- Oh God, she's found her.
- Found who?

58:05.420 --> 58:07.189
Red Cat Morgan.

58:09.224 --> 58:10.893
My friend.

58:12.795 --> 58:14.129
That
thing around her neck,

58:14.129 --> 58:16.632
that's what Walsh
has been looking for.

58:16.632 --> 58:20.736
Walsh's father was a respected
historian and archeologist

58:20.736 --> 58:24.339
specializing in
18th-century piracy,

58:24.339 --> 58:29.411
in particular Red Cat
Morgan and her vast riches.

58:30.212 --> 58:31.681
On one of his expeditions,

58:31.681 --> 58:34.584
he discovered three small
bundles of cloth all decorated

58:34.584 --> 58:39.421
with a distinct crest,
in one a pendant,

58:39.421 --> 58:41.957
in the other two, nothing.

58:43.292 --> 58:46.696
It led him to buy the
Dragon Princess restaurant

58:46.696 --> 58:49.364
thinking the crest was a
sign of where the treasure

58:49.364 --> 58:53.202
or, at very least, the other
two pendants were kept.

58:54.303 --> 58:55.738
That's why the
symbol on her wrist

58:55.738 --> 58:57.773
matches the one on Dragon
Princess restaurant.

58:59.508 --> 59:01.243
He was wrong,
it was a red herring

59:01.243 --> 59:02.712
and there was no treasure.

59:02.712 --> 59:05.347
There was no more pendants,
he got the wrong place.

59:07.983 --> 59:10.820
It was an obsession that
spread from father to son.

59:11.954 --> 59:15.124
All that spurred them on
was that single pendant,

59:15.124 --> 59:17.326
which they knew was
only one of three.

59:21.330 --> 59:24.199
Months ago, a geological
expedition stumbled

59:24.199 --> 59:25.835
across Marshanda's ship.

59:25.835 --> 59:28.270
Walsh used all his
underground connections

59:28.270 --> 59:32.608
to get Marshanda's body and
what she wore around her wrist.

59:32.608 --> 59:35.778
It was only then he learned
what his father never knew.

59:37.146 --> 59:40.049
The wrist device contains
a compass which locks in

59:40.049 --> 59:41.817
on each of the pendants.

59:41.817 --> 59:44.353
When all three are brought
together and inserted

59:44.353 --> 59:45.855
into the wrist device,

59:45.855 --> 59:49.091
the compass would guide the
wearer to the final treasure.

59:50.626 --> 59:53.929
Marshanda's pendant
guided her to Red Cat.

59:53.929 --> 59:56.431
Now it's only Walsh's piece
that needs to be added

59:56.431 --> 59:59.935
before he can finally
get what he wants.

01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:12.581
I'm your crew
now, you're safe,

01:00:13.382 --> 01:00:15.250
I'll take care of you.

01:00:16.451 --> 01:00:17.352
Sister.

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.673
- You don't want to go right?
- Which way?

01:00:46.749 --> 01:00:49.284
No, no, that looks
like the wrong way.

01:00:49.284 --> 01:00:50.720
You said it was that way.

01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:57.993
You go, I fight.

01:00:57.993 --> 01:00:59.328
Good idea, she should fight.

01:00:59.328 --> 01:01:01.363
- Shut up.
- She's great at it,

01:01:01.363 --> 01:01:02.832
what'd you want from me?

01:01:02.832 --> 01:01:04.867
- What are those, tracks?
- Yeah.

01:01:04.867 --> 01:01:07.169
- Must've gone down there.
- Yeah, I see it.

01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:08.904
I can't leave her.

01:01:11.473 --> 01:01:13.442
Move, move.

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:30.259
Get them out of here.

01:02:13.635 --> 01:02:14.703
Stop them!

01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:50.105
Let's get you out, come on.

01:02:50.105 --> 01:02:52.141
I can't go back,
they'll kill Eddie.

01:02:53.642 --> 01:02:56.211
- Run and get help.
- Marshanda.

01:02:56.211 --> 01:02:58.881
They need her alive, you'll
do better than the others.

01:02:58.881 --> 01:03:01.050
Get out of here, follow
the breeze, go, go.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:02.484
All right, all right.

01:03:44.793 --> 01:03:46.295
Look out!

01:04:03.745 --> 01:04:04.646
No!

01:04:05.647 --> 01:04:07.049
No!

01:04:48.123 --> 01:04:49.691
We've got
them all now boss,

01:04:49.691 --> 01:04:52.061
they're not going anywhere.

01:04:52.061 --> 01:04:55.230
Good, I'll go
get Mr. Walsh down here.

01:04:57.266 --> 01:04:58.833
Let's finish this.

01:05:20.022 --> 01:05:21.723
Look, I don't
want any trouble.

01:05:28.797 --> 01:05:30.966
You're not going
get away with this.

01:05:33.035 --> 01:05:35.804
Don't you
try to move, any of you.

01:05:43.212 --> 01:05:44.746
Whoa!

01:05:44.746 --> 01:05:45.647
Careful.

01:05:46.515 --> 01:05:48.383
Sorry.

01:05:48.383 --> 01:05:50.119
What, it's empty?

01:05:51.153 --> 01:05:53.188
- I knew I'd find you.
- Shut up.

01:05:54.456 --> 01:05:55.457
I thought you were dead.

01:05:55.457 --> 01:05:56.725
I thought you were all dead.

01:05:56.725 --> 01:05:57.993
We tried to slip a
gun off one of them

01:05:57.993 --> 01:06:00.895
and then these two gave
'em the old Liam Neeson.

01:06:00.895 --> 01:06:01.863
Which one of these is loaded?

01:06:01.863 --> 01:06:03.165
I don't know.

01:06:03.165 --> 01:06:04.399
Is she gonna be all right?

01:06:04.399 --> 01:06:05.300
Well, she's made of
pretty tough stuff.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.601
I have to go.

01:06:06.601 --> 01:06:08.203
We can't get
her through that pipe,

01:06:08.203 --> 01:06:09.638
not if she's out cold.

01:06:09.638 --> 01:06:10.839
Worse than that, there's
more on them waiting

01:06:10.839 --> 01:06:12.074
on the other side.

01:06:12.074 --> 01:06:13.008
We have to go, we
need get out of here,

01:06:13.008 --> 01:06:14.076
we need to follow that breeze.

01:06:14.076 --> 01:06:15.377
Tough guy is up there.

01:06:15.377 --> 01:06:18.147
Yeah, well we have these.

01:06:27.689 --> 01:06:28.590
Got any gum?

01:06:29.491 --> 01:06:30.592
Left it in the car.

01:06:53.048 --> 01:06:55.417
It's going to be okay,
we're gonna get out.

01:06:55.417 --> 01:06:59.020
Hey, you guys, I
found it, a way out.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.623
South Bank, I can see Pizza
Express, it's this way.

01:07:01.623 --> 01:07:03.425
Oh, if you wouldn't mind leaving

01:07:03.425 --> 01:07:06.495
a positive Trip Advisor
review, I'd be very grateful.

01:07:06.495 --> 01:07:09.231
Perhaps best not to mention
the hostage situation

01:07:10.099 --> 01:07:11.633
or all of the dead people.

01:07:12.801 --> 01:07:13.702
Thank you.

01:07:17.272 --> 01:07:19.308
Get them out,
call the police now.

01:07:19.308 --> 01:07:21.643
- You're not coming.
- I need to help her.

01:07:23.812 --> 01:07:25.180
The passcode's one,
two, three, four,

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.881
don't check my messages.

01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:38.193
What are you doing?

01:07:39.694 --> 01:07:40.929
I just thought we,

01:07:40.929 --> 01:07:42.063
I just thought we were
really good back there.

01:07:42.063 --> 01:07:44.266
- I didn't--
- No, not really.

01:07:44.266 --> 01:07:47.869
- No?.
- Don't ever do that again.

01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:51.640
Right, sorry, sorry.

01:07:52.474 --> 01:07:53.908
You're a strange man.

01:08:08.257 --> 01:08:11.360
Ah, not so fast, or
turner faces the soup.

01:08:17.699 --> 01:08:18.600
All clear.

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.537
Wonderful.

01:08:23.705 --> 01:08:24.973
You're all here.

01:08:29.878 --> 01:08:33.182
- Where's Eddie?
- Resting Easy with the doc,

01:08:34.549 --> 01:08:37.452
helping restore your little
tavern to its former glories.

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:40.755
There he is.

01:08:44.092 --> 01:08:46.027
Like playing with rocks, do you?

01:08:51.166 --> 01:08:52.133
Look at me.

01:08:57.306 --> 01:08:59.841
No, stop, stop, stop.

01:09:01.243 --> 01:09:02.811
Put your hands down.

01:09:04.346 --> 01:09:07.249
Put your hands down.

01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:10.385
Please,

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:15.089
please, please don't
let your men hurt him.

01:09:15.089 --> 01:09:17.426
Please, please,
honestly, we'll help you.

01:09:39.047 --> 01:09:40.515
Bring me the wrist device.

01:09:51.993 --> 01:09:53.027
It still works.

01:09:54.463 --> 01:09:59.301
We found Red's piece and
of course Marshanda's.

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:16.418
It's here.

01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:22.190
Bring our niece and the barmaid
to keep her well behaved.

01:10:23.325 --> 01:10:26.060
Keep the rest here as a
bit of extra collateral.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.530
If you behave, they'll live.

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:29.864
If she behaves, you live.

01:10:36.671 --> 01:10:37.572
Yeah.

01:11:11.039 --> 01:11:11.906
Why?

01:11:14.509 --> 01:11:17.078
Because I can and he couldn't.

01:11:17.078 --> 01:11:19.113
Is that worth
murdering my friends?

01:11:19.113 --> 01:11:20.014
Needs must

01:11:21.683 --> 01:11:23.017
and I need her.

01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:36.858
Coordinates,

01:12:36.858 --> 01:12:41.830
leading to riches, my riches.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.769
Aren't you rich enough?

01:12:47.769 --> 01:12:50.739
No, I wanna be double rich.

01:12:56.545 --> 01:12:58.012
How do you like me now, Dad?

01:13:00.882 --> 01:13:03.885
With these scrolls in
this particular order, I,

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:09.390
You fucker.

01:13:12.293 --> 01:13:14.262
Do you remember the
order they were in?

01:13:14.262 --> 01:13:16.598
No, I was keeping
an eye on them.

01:13:17.899 --> 01:13:20.334
Does anyone remember
the order they were in?

01:13:21.369 --> 01:13:22.270
Fuck!

01:13:23.137 --> 01:13:25.507
Years we've been
working on this.

01:13:28.743 --> 01:13:31.412
Does it say
what order they should be in?

01:13:31.412 --> 01:13:33.247
No, I can't read this shit,

01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:35.416
this is some dead pirate code.

01:13:53.935 --> 01:13:55.069
Mia, catch.

01:13:58.873 --> 01:14:01.242
Red Cat's painting, the code.

01:14:09.884 --> 01:14:11.686
There's something on this,

01:14:11.686 --> 01:14:13.588
it will help me open that.

01:14:13.588 --> 01:14:15.056
What if it's a booby trap?

01:14:16.858 --> 01:14:18.693
Come on Mia, come on.

01:14:21.996 --> 01:14:23.832
Come on, come on, think,
think, think, think.

01:14:23.832 --> 01:14:25.767
Come on Mia, think.

01:15:23.692 --> 01:15:25.093
I got the codes.

01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:37.005
Hey, I don't suppose DeCoon's
holding a first hostage rule

01:15:37.005 --> 01:15:39.641
would be a problem for you.

01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:43.578
You can't leave!

01:15:44.813 --> 01:15:46.648
I have money!

01:15:46.648 --> 01:15:47.548
Asshole.

01:15:50.919 --> 01:15:53.321
You can't leave me!

01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:54.723
Wait!

01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:56.791
No!

01:16:17.846 --> 01:16:21.015
Welcome to the Smuggler's
Tavern, so head to the toilets,

01:16:21.015 --> 01:16:23.584
empty those bladders before
entering Benny's hatch,

01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:25.887
and crawling through the
claustrophobic labyrinth

01:16:25.887 --> 01:16:27.889
of Sebastian's tunnels.

01:16:27.889 --> 01:16:32.961
Argh, welcome mateys to the
underground caves of Soho.

01:16:34.228 --> 01:16:35.163
Waterproofs are available
just through here.

01:16:35.163 --> 01:16:36.364
It is quite claustrophobic,

01:16:36.364 --> 01:16:38.667
so you have been
warned, no refunds.

01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:42.170
How much do pirates
pay for their earrings?

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:45.306
A buck-an-ear,
come on this way.

01:16:48.309 --> 01:16:49.310
All right, we're off.

01:16:50.979 --> 01:16:51.880
Be careful.

01:16:54.048 --> 01:16:57.618
Don't fuck the
place up, Eddie.

01:16:59.287 --> 01:17:00.588
Ah, she's getting
really good at that.

01:17:00.588 --> 01:17:02.857
It's the most
pertinent sentence.

01:17:02.857 --> 01:17:04.625
Seriously though, be careful.

01:17:08.797 --> 01:17:11.132
- We need money.
- Very nice.

01:17:11.132 --> 01:17:13.101
And I've got pictures on
my phone and the cloud.

01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:14.635
So we've got a plan B.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.441
Nice.

01:17:20.441 --> 01:17:21.342
Hey, Mi.

01:17:25.579 --> 01:17:26.480
Thanks.

01:17:38.827 --> 01:17:42.964
You sure you don't
want a hand with that.
