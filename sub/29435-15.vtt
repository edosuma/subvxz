Stand up.

in defenseless creatures.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.017
So you can show your friends
how tough you are?

You better hope that ain't
from one of my bucks.

see you back so soon.

Lives in Reston.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.531
You talk to
the property owner?

03:47.575 --> 03:50.534
Yeah. She says the, uh, area
is closed to the public,

03:50.578 --> 03:52.144
but due to the heavy
deer population

03:52.188 --> 03:53.711
they get quite a few poachers.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.539
I'd say this could be
a hunting accident,

he's been here

04:38.408 --> 04:40.236
for quite some time.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.194
Based on the beetle larva
on him,

04:42.238 --> 04:44.022
I'd say it's been six weeks.

JIMMY:
Entry wound in the chest

04:46.764 --> 04:48.331

the most likely culprit.

And the last text he
made was to a woman

investigation.

about four weeks now.

You'd love her.

to do with the murder, do you?

Phil, I don't think
anything yet.

if you can believe that.

Uh, look, I'm telling you,
that app saved my life.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.164
I was in a dark place
after the divorce.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.949
Then a friend turned
me on to Fleet Date.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.559

rough going at first.

weirdos out there.

We were talking
about Alan Wales.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.719
How long were you
and Wales together?

07:38.762 --> 07:41.330
Uh, on and off
for about a month.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.158
Just wasn't that serious.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.202
Why not?

07:44.246 --> 07:46.161
Because he could be
really vain.

07:46.204 --> 07:47.467
He was always working out,

07:47.510 --> 07:50.382
like he was trying to prove
his masculinity.

07:50.426 --> 07:54.082
Unlike Phil, who just
exudes it naturally, you know?

...I'll put my hand
around here...

07:57.259 --> 07:59.043

Um, when was the last time
you saw Captain Wales?

08:03.047 --> 08:05.876
Uh, about six weeks ago.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.095
We were supposed to
have a date,

08:07.138 --> 08:08.749
but he just stopped
replying to my texts.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.228
What do they call that?

08:10.272 --> 08:11.665
He ghosted you.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.667
Yeah, ghosted.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.538
I thought he just
blew me off.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.279
But I always had
the feeling

08:17.322 --> 08:20.543
that I wasn't the only woman
he was seeing, you know?

Player.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.155
Thanks for your time.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.548
We're also gonna
need an account of

08:25.592 --> 08:27.942
your whereabouts around
the time of Wales's death.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.334
Of course, of course.

08:29.378 --> 08:32.120
I have detailed records
of my schedule at my office.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.861
I'm a JAG lawyer.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.950
Yeah, not just any JAG
lawyer; one of the best.

[chuckling]:
Phil, you...

08:37.299 --> 08:38.779

Well, it's true.
You're a genius.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.128
STACY:
You're too kind.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.130
And you are too beautiful.
That's what you are.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.131
No, no, come on.[laughs]

08:43.174 --> 08:44.524
Come on.
You are so beautiful.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.570
Okay, we're just gonna
let ourselves out.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.180
STACY: I love your
mustache so much.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.008
PHIL: Oh, thank you so much.STACY: Come on.

BISHOP:
Huh.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.142
What, you find something
unusual?

08:54.185 --> 08:55.970
No, I'm just going through
Wales's Fleet Date account.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.363
It's amazing how many people
I know that are on here.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.061
Yeah, you won't find me
in one of those apps.

09:00.104 --> 09:03.325
Why? It's, like,
how people meet these days.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.240
I don't know, I like to meet
women the old-fashioned way.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.242
I feel like all these computers,
they, you know,

09:07.285 --> 09:10.462
they take away some of that...
[clicks tongue] ...magic.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.030
Oh... my God.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.119
I just toggled over
to "single men"

09:15.163 --> 09:17.208
just to see who's on it, and...

09:17.252 --> 09:19.254
Vance's profile came up.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.038
BOTH:
No!

09:21.082 --> 09:22.126
BISHOP:
Yeah.

09:24.215 --> 09:28.655
Favorite activities: sailing,
listening to live music...

09:28.698 --> 09:31.919
Is that a picture of him
in his bathing suit?

09:31.962 --> 09:34.051
Ooh, how do I unsee that?[groans]

09:34.095 --> 09:35.444
He is fit.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.446
I don't know, this is like
a Japanese horror film.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.056
We all might die in seven days.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.624
Okay, let's agree to never
talk about this again.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.017
Good. Then we can
get back to work.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.280
Give me an update.

09:45.323 --> 09:49.153
Well, DoD reported Captain Wales
missing six weeks ago.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.068
Highly decorated,
single, no kids.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.548
Checked out his
dating history,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.071
and Stacy was right.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.247
Wales was a player;
he dated lots of people,

09:56.291 --> 09:58.119
often at the same time.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.425
McGEE:
Which means our suspect pool
just got a whole lot larger.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.818
Phil's girlfriend in the pool?

10:01.862 --> 10:03.428
TORRES:
Her alibi checks out.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.126
At the time of Wales' death,

10:05.169 --> 10:07.694
she was on a case in Atlanta
for about two weeks.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.652
GIBBS:
Crime scene. Shot with an arrow.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.088
Naked. Why?

10:11.132 --> 10:12.699
Humiliation.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.701
Maybe as retribution
for Wales

10:14.744 --> 10:16.354
humiliating the
killer in the past.

10:16.398 --> 10:19.053
As for the arrow,
it's kind of obvious.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.621
The killer literally wanted
to break Wales's heart.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.884
Premeditated.
Crime of passion.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.320
Keep digging.

10:25.363 --> 10:26.843
Uh, Gibbs, do you
have a second?

10:26.887 --> 10:28.062
Yeah. What's up?

10:28.105 --> 10:30.673
I, uh, just wanted
to thank you,

10:30.717 --> 10:32.240
you know, for the
chocolates and flowers.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.720
It was really sweet.

10:35.069 --> 10:38.376
Jack, I didn't even know
it was Valentine's Day.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.508
Really?

10:39.551 --> 10:42.119
The whole office
thinks it's you.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.426
I wish I'd thought about it.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.689
Okay.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.431
Okay.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.521
Hmm.

10:52.564 --> 10:53.870
Hey, Kasie.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.089
[loud thunk]

10:55.132 --> 10:56.220
Whoa!

10:56.264 --> 10:58.527
Oh, my God. Nick, are you okay?

10:58.570 --> 10:59.789
What are you trying to do?

10:59.833 --> 11:01.399
Trying to send me back
to the hospital?

11:01.443 --> 11:05.142
I am so sorry.
The arrow just got away from me.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.535
What's this?

11:06.578 --> 11:07.884
I'm trying to figure out how far

11:07.928 --> 11:09.277
our killer stood
from the victim.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.582
It's not going so well?

11:10.626 --> 11:11.758
I am from New York.
What do I look like,

11:11.801 --> 11:13.063
Robin Hood from the hood?

11:13.107 --> 11:16.240
Come on. Let me see. Let me see.

11:17.285 --> 11:20.592
Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:20.636 --> 11:21.855
Mm-hmm.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.337
You sure you want
to be doing this?

11:26.381 --> 11:28.426
Archery puts a lot
of strain on your muscles.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.647
Muscles you really
should be resting.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.954
[shushes]

11:33.997 --> 11:36.217
You're messing with
my concentration.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.264
Boom! Ha. Still got it.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.832
Yeah, you do.
[laughs]

11:42.876 --> 11:45.574
So, uh, any progress
on the case?

11:45.617 --> 11:48.316
Uh, I'm still processing
the rest of the arrow.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.534
Haven't found any
prints so far.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.842
What about the arrowhead?
Can you trace it?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.975
The make is a carbon
steel broadhead.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.717
Pretty commonplace. Anybody
could've purchased it.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.196
Okay, so we got nothing.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.198
I didn't say that.
While I was

12:01.242 --> 12:03.200
researching arrowheads,
I came across

12:03.244 --> 12:05.202
an MPD case
from four months ago.

12:05.246 --> 12:09.380
A guy was found half-naked
with a hole in his chest.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.339
Want to see the
murder weapon?

12:16.997 --> 12:18.781
Thanks for coming down,
Detective.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.522
Oh, yeah, no problem. Uh...

12:20.565 --> 12:23.307
I told your agent, we're at
a dead end with our case.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.353
Uh, not sure
if I'm gonna be able to help.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.920
What do you got?

12:26.963 --> 12:29.966
Uh, about four months ago,
a Chinese joint downtown.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.099
Busboy goes out for a smoke,

12:32.142 --> 12:34.318
and he sees Olson
in the alley,

12:34.362 --> 12:36.494
naked, with an arrow
coming out of his chest.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.975
And that would be
Chief Petty Officer Craig Olson?

12:39.019 --> 12:40.803
Yeah. I mean, he was retired.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.762
That's why we hadn't
notified you guys yet.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.198
You find anything on the scene?

12:44.241 --> 12:47.592
Well, the arrow was clean.
No prints, no fibers.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.377
We canvassed the block, but, uh,

12:49.420 --> 12:50.900
there were no witnesses,
no suspects.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.903
Okay, and Craig Olson,
what can you tell us about him?

12:53.947 --> 12:56.427
He's a family man. Wife, kids.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.952
You find any of those
love connection thingamajiggers

12:58.995 --> 13:00.214
on his phone?

13:00.257 --> 13:01.911
The what? How?

13:01.955 --> 13:04.348
[clears throat]
He means, uh, dating apps.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.133
LOGAN [chuckles]:
Oh. Uh, no, no.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.830
Nothing like that. Uh...

13:07.874 --> 13:10.311
Like I said,
it was a dead end for us.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.836
So you think
we're looking at

13:13.880 --> 13:15.446
the same perp
for both these murders?

13:15.490 --> 13:16.534
Hard for it not to be.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.101
I mean, but what's the pattern?

13:18.145 --> 13:19.407
Besides them both

13:19.450 --> 13:21.278
being Navy men,
they have nothing in common.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.280
Well, maybe
they knew each other.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.327
Oh, after we heard from
you, we did check Olson's

13:26.370 --> 13:28.938
phone records and e-mails,
and Wales' name never came up.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.244
[door opens]

13:30.287 --> 13:31.985
Sorry to interrupt, boss.
You got a minute?

13:37.294 --> 13:39.862
I was going through
Olson's evidence box.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.953
Found his cell. Turns out he was
on Fleet Date, same as Wales.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.173
No. Not according to MPD.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.652
That's because Olson
used a software

13:47.696 --> 13:49.350
to hide it on his phone.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.961
His wife.
Yeah.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.311
So I was going through
Olson's dating history,

13:54.355 --> 13:56.836
and guess who he was seeing
right before his death.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.883
Think your friend Phil

14:00.927 --> 14:02.842
may be dating
a serial killer, boss.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.679
Look, Agent Gibbs,
I know how this looks.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.595
Two men I dated
are dead.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.294
But I didn't kill them.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.296
What's my motive?

14:22.339 --> 14:25.299
Wales and Olson were womanizers.

14:25.342 --> 14:28.302
And what, I found out
and wanted revenge?

14:28.345 --> 14:29.738
Come on. That's weak.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.348
And you know it.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.394
I'd have to be
pretty stupid

14:33.437 --> 14:36.223
to kill both men when the dating
app points right back to me.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.094
It's too self-incriminating.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.749
And I have an alibi.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.577
Not for Olson you don't.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.927
Mm, I do for Wales.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.407
I was in Atlanta.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.322
You had a few days off.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.801
Oh, here we go.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.455
You could've driven.Mm.

14:51.499 --> 14:55.329
Could've driven here, committed
the murder and then drove back.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.809
This is all
way too circumstantial.

14:57.853 --> 15:01.378
I could've also just sat
in my hotel room the whole day

15:01.422 --> 15:04.120
watching pay-per-view.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.949
Which I did, by the way.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.604
You can check the hotel records.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.345
What do you think?

15:11.388 --> 15:13.434
She's smart, credible.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.089
Still, I can't shake the feeling
that she's hiding something.

15:16.132 --> 15:20.310
Speaking of secrets, you
find out who your admirer was?

15:20.354 --> 15:22.486
I haven't really
thought about it much.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.835
Really? Hmm.Mm...

15:23.879 --> 15:26.055
That would drive me crazy.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.535
We could call
the delivery service.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.016
Oh, honey, please.
I already have.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.235
They-they were no
help at all.Mm.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.759
It doesn't matter. Right?

15:34.803 --> 15:37.240
These things have a way
of revealing themselves.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.025
STACY:
Look,

15:39.068 --> 15:42.550
the only reason I agreed
to talk without a lawyer present

15:42.593 --> 15:46.554
is because Phil said
you were a fair man.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.296
And I'm seriously
starting to doubt that.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.907
"Tucker."

15:51.951 --> 15:53.561
What?

15:53.604 --> 15:57.130
Uh, your last name.
Used to be Tucker.

15:58.218 --> 16:01.264
Tucker was my married name.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.701
You guys get divorced or what?

16:03.745 --> 16:05.616
You're looking
right at the report.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.579
It was an accident.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.583
He died.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.629
Lot of men seem to die
around you, huh?

16:18.673 --> 16:23.199
Unless you have something to
charge me with, we're done here.

16:23.243 --> 16:26.463
Give me an update. What do
we know about the husband?

16:26.507 --> 16:28.248
Um...

16:28.291 --> 16:30.772
Mark Tucker, married
to Stacy for 13 years.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.078
They lived in
Adams County,

16:32.121 --> 16:34.123
Virginia, where he worked
in his family's

16:34.167 --> 16:35.603
livestock business.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.997
Died five years ago
at the age of 47.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.129
How?McGEE: Well, we checked
both the police

16:40.173 --> 16:43.132
and coroner reports, but it just
listed death as accidental

16:43.176 --> 16:45.265
and having taken place
in their home.

16:45.308 --> 16:48.268
I put in a call to the sheriff
who was in charge of the case.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.444
Okay, go pay him a visit.
Take Bishop with you.

16:50.487 --> 16:53.229
Where is Palmer on the autopsy?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.797
Uh, he just got Olson's body
from the D.C. medical examiner.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.233
I'll check in with him.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.844
Gibbs.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.281
Oh, boy.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.891
Is it true?

17:02.934 --> 17:04.284
Did you interrogate
my girlfriend?

17:04.327 --> 17:05.285
Phil,

17:05.328 --> 17:07.069
not here.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.507
How could you do that?

17:10.551 --> 17:13.119
Were you even gonna tell me?Yes.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.164
I was going to tell you.
I was waiting to have the facts.

17:15.208 --> 17:18.211
Oh, you can't possibly think
she's a murderer.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.386
She's innocent, Gibbs.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.127
We do not know that yet.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.171
Yeah, but I do.

17:22.215 --> 17:23.259
I know her.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.305
You've been with her
for four weeks.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.958
Doesn't matter.
I just know.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.396
And I'm a pretty good
judge of character.
Phil!

17:29.439 --> 17:32.181
Your ex-wife cheated on you
with the same guy

17:32.225 --> 17:33.530
who tried to murder you.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.532
Oh. Yeah, fair point.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.099
Yeah. Forget I said that.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.493
Uh, look, you're wrong
about her.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.886
You know how much
she means to me. I need this.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.888
Oh, come on.A-All right, look.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.108
How about I-I prove
to you she's innocent?

17:46.152 --> 17:48.980
I join the investigation
and help out.
No. No. No.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.244
I helped you catch that
murderer last year in the woods.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.723
I'm practically an agent.

17:52.767 --> 17:53.942
No, you're an accountant.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.422
Eh.And last year
in the woods,

17:55.465 --> 17:56.901
you fell off a trail.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.556
And you got
Fornell shot.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.906
God, I wish you didn't
have such a good memory.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.473
Forgot about that.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.346
[sighs]

18:07.782 --> 18:09.566
Phil, come on.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.961
If Stacy is innocent,
I'll find out.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.052
And you stay away from her.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.098
Okay.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.931
[sighs]

18:28.281 --> 18:29.543
You coming?

18:29.586 --> 18:31.153
Mm-hmm.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.850
What's wrong? Are you okay?

18:32.894 --> 18:36.898
Yeah. I must have, uh,
had some bad Thai for lunch.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.900
Uh-uh. You're in pain,
aren't you?

18:38.943 --> 18:40.380
I told you to take it easy.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.469
Maybe you should just
sit this one out and rest.

18:43.513 --> 18:46.690
Okay, yes. I'm a little sore.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.171
Mm-hmm.But I know what I
can and can't do.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.043
I just wish people would
stop fussing over me.Mm.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.567
[quietly]:
Okay.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.612
Are youcoming?

18:58.528 --> 19:00.661
TALBOT:
I pulled the Tucker file
after you called.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.228
Here you go.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.881
Shame what happened to Mark.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.187
What do you remember?

19:05.231 --> 19:06.928
Around five years ago,

19:06.971 --> 19:10.105
Mark's wife Stacy-- real nice
lady, smart as a whip--

19:10.149 --> 19:13.543
came home to find him facedown
at the bottom of the stairs.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.241
Wow. He fell?

19:15.284 --> 19:17.243
TALBOT:
Just a tragic accident.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.940
Seems he had
one too many that night

19:18.983 --> 19:20.594
and went ass over teakettle.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.857
BISHOP:
Yeah, that wouldn't account for

19:22.900 --> 19:25.990
the lacerations on his head
and the amount of blood loss.

19:26.034 --> 19:29.255
What are you saying?
That he was murdered?

19:29.298 --> 19:31.082
It was an accident.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.084
Maybe that's what Stacy
wanted you to think.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.086
No, sir.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.611
I've known that girl
since she was a baby.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.961
She doesn't have
a mean bone in her body.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.963
All right, Sheriff,
well, we won't take up

19:42.006 --> 19:44.400
any more of your time.
Thank you for the file.

19:44.444 --> 19:47.055
You do much archery around here?

19:47.098 --> 19:48.926
Yeah. I used to coach

19:48.970 --> 19:51.625
the kids during
summer camp back in the day.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.583
You ever teach Stacy?

19:53.627 --> 19:56.020
Come to think of it, I did.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.240
She was pretty good at it, too.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.945
I am so sorry this happened,
my darling.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.121
You know if I could
change it, I would.

20:10.165 --> 20:12.950
Just know that I love you, okay?

20:12.994 --> 20:14.996
Jimmy?

20:15.039 --> 20:17.085
Oh, got to go. McGee's here.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.521
Yeah. I got to go.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.436
Love you, too, honey. Yeah.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.003
Thank God, man.
[laughs]

20:22.046 --> 20:23.091
I didn't see the...

20:24.179 --> 20:25.659
In the ear, and...

20:25.702 --> 20:28.139
Never mind. How's Breena?

20:28.183 --> 20:31.142
Uh, Breena is, uh,
uh, not happy. You know?

20:31.186 --> 20:33.319
With the two bodies
in autopsy now,

20:33.362 --> 20:35.146
the chocolate-dipped
strawberries

20:35.190 --> 20:37.366
are gonna have to wait.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.891
Well, were you able to make
any progress at least?

20:40.935 --> 20:43.154
Yes. I was able to determine
they were both killed

20:43.198 --> 20:45.374
by the exact same type
of weapon.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.376
Oh, and I found
something interesting.

20:47.420 --> 20:50.901
Organ damage that occurred
prior to death.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.076
On which victim?

20:52.120 --> 20:54.601
Both of them.
It's pretty severe, too.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.038
Like they both have
been sick for quite some time.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.909
Hell of a coincidence. Huh?

20:58.953 --> 21:00.476
Yeah. Any idea
what caused it?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.000
No, no. I just sent a tissue
sample up to Kasie for analysis.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.785
Hey, guys.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.134
Oh, wow. That was fast.

21:06.177 --> 21:07.266
You got the
tissue samples already?

21:07.309 --> 21:09.137
What? Oh, no.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.965
I'm good, but I'm not that good.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.315
I have something even better.

21:13.359 --> 21:16.144
I finished processing the arrow
found at the crime scene,

21:16.187 --> 21:17.928
and I found a strand of hair.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.322
Could be our killer's.Yeah, it was tangled up

21:20.366 --> 21:22.106
amongst the feathers
at the end of the arrow.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.717
How does that happen?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.022
Oh, here, let me show you.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.415
BOTH:
Whoa! No, no, no!

21:27.982 --> 21:30.506
You know, you can
just tell us.

21:30.550 --> 21:33.683
Oh. Well, when the killer
pulled the bow back,

21:33.727 --> 21:35.903
the end of the arrow must've
brushed against their head,

21:35.946 --> 21:37.208
yanked up a strand
of their hair.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.906
Oh, that's fantastic.

21:38.949 --> 21:41.909
Stacy's in the Navy. That means
we already have her DNA on file,

21:41.952 --> 21:43.476
so we just
match it against

21:43.519 --> 21:46.000
the DNA on the hair and see
if we've got our killer.

21:46.043 --> 21:49.351
Yeah, unfortunately,
it won't be that easy.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.788
McGEE: The hair
that Kasie found

21:51.832 --> 21:55.139
was not attached to a root,
which means...Doesn't have DNA.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.838
Right, but what it does have
is hair dye.

21:57.881 --> 22:01.058
The killer uses
a unique organic dye

22:01.102 --> 22:02.495
made from
a henna plant.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.714
So, if Stacy uses the same dye,
then we have a match?

22:04.758 --> 22:06.325
McGEE: Correct.You're forgetting
something.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.631
We need Stacy's hair
to match it.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.286
And something tells me
she won't give it willingly,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.462
and we might have a hard time
getting a warrant.

22:13.506 --> 22:14.855
Oh, we don't need
a warrant.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.598
We have a man
on the inside.
No.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.122
Nick is right. Phil could
go on a date with Stacy

22:21.165 --> 22:22.689
and get a hair
sample for us.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.212
No, not happening.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.910
Wouldn't be admissible in court,
given how we obtained it.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.434
No, we're not doing this.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.219
But if it matches
and we use it to confront her...

22:31.262 --> 22:33.656
It may be good enough to rattle
a confession out of her.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.398
I am not putting my friend
in danger, okay?

22:36.442 --> 22:38.400
If Stacy is our killer,

22:38.444 --> 22:41.272
every minute she's out there,
Phil's already in danger.

22:44.972 --> 22:48.671
Okay, this is great, guys.
I promise I won't let you down.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.370
Just grab a sample
of her hair and get out.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.154
Okay. Uh, question:

22:53.197 --> 22:55.504
Do I get to carry a gun?No.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.506
Okay, geez, just asking.

22:57.550 --> 23:00.161
All right, Phil, now, we're
gonna be watching and listening

23:00.204 --> 23:03.556
from the car here. This pen
has a microphone hidden inside.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.166
If you get into
any trouble at all,

23:05.209 --> 23:07.081
say the word,
we'll be there.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.822
Like a code word?

23:08.865 --> 23:11.999
Okay, let's see, uh,
how about, um,

23:12.042 --> 23:15.002
pineapple? Kumquat?

23:15.045 --> 23:17.874
Or something more spy-like,
like, uh, tread stone.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.441
Or enigma? Oh, blackwater.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.747
Just pick a word.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.444
Okay, all right. Abacus, abacus.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.577
I'm an accountant.
It's easiest to remember.

23:24.620 --> 23:27.275
Besides, nothing's gonna happen.
I'm not gonna need it anyway.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.277
I told you, Stacy's innocent.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.235
She didn't kill
those two guys.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.107
Three, actually.

23:33.150 --> 23:36.240
We believe that she, uh, may
have killed her husband, too.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.242
Three?

23:38.286 --> 23:40.462
Yeah. Good luck, Phil.

23:40.506 --> 23:41.855
Three.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.988
Make yourself comfortable.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.076
Dinner shouldn't
be much longer.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.774
Ah, can't wait.
Mm-hmm.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.297
Mm.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.216
You know, frankly,
I'm a little surprised

23:55.259 --> 23:57.610
you're here after what
your friend said about me.

23:57.653 --> 24:00.090
Oh, that's just Gibbs.
He, uh, he accuses people

24:00.134 --> 24:01.657
of murder all the time.
[clears throat]

24:01.701 --> 24:03.311
I know he's your friend,
but honestly,

24:03.354 --> 24:04.921
I don't know
what you see in him.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.796
I mean, that steely gaze

24:09.839 --> 24:12.363
and "man of a few words"
routine.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.323
Who's he kidding?

24:15.366 --> 24:17.673
Does that actually work
on anyone?

24:17.717 --> 24:19.153
And you know what?

24:19.196 --> 24:21.764
I don't care what people say,
he's not that handsome.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.331
[chuckles]You know?

24:23.374 --> 24:24.375
Totally agree.

24:28.162 --> 24:32.035
And after the way he treated me,
he's lucky I don't sue his ass.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.733
I'm sure he was just
doing his job.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.823
Yeah, but you don't
believe him, right?

24:36.866 --> 24:39.869
I mean, that's why you're here.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.742
Right. Of course.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.701
'Cause, Phil,
if this is gonna work,

24:45.745 --> 24:47.311
we've got to have trust.

24:47.355 --> 24:50.271
I can't be with anyone
who doesn't have my back.

24:50.314 --> 24:51.881
I couldn't agree more.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.543
What are you doing?[gasps]

25:02.892 --> 25:04.764
Why are you holding my brush?

25:04.807 --> 25:07.027
PHIL:
I was, um...

25:07.070 --> 25:08.811
Uh, I was...

25:08.855 --> 25:10.639
I was...Brushing your hair?

25:10.683 --> 25:12.598
[stammers] Pineapple.

25:12.641 --> 25:13.947
What?

25:13.990 --> 25:16.471
Uh, no, wait, uh, tread stone.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.168
Oh, damn it.
Code word.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.388
Code word. Code word!

25:23.086 --> 25:25.959
Sounds like Phil's in trouble.
Should we go inside?

25:32.313 --> 25:33.314
I don't think so.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.319
Give me my brush.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.976
Did you really think
I could be a murderer?

25:48.329 --> 25:50.853
Give that
to your friends

25:50.897 --> 25:53.377
for their DNA test.

25:53.421 --> 25:56.163
I don't ever want
to see you again.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.469
Get out of here.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.263
Innocent?

26:09.306 --> 26:12.179
Kasie ran the test twice.
Stacy's hair is not a match.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.441
Poor Phil.

26:13.484 --> 26:15.791
Poor us. Now one of us
has to tell Gibbs

26:15.835 --> 26:17.314
that we lost our only suspect.

26:17.358 --> 26:19.229
Oh, yeah,
good luck with that.
What?

26:19.273 --> 26:21.623
Oh, hell no, I'm not gonna be
the one to tell him.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.103
He already knows.BISHOP: Hey,

26:23.146 --> 26:25.409
Gibbs, uh, you talk to Phil?
How's he handling it?

26:25.453 --> 26:28.151
He's not.
Stacy won't return his calls.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.500
Well, can you blame her?

26:29.544 --> 26:31.328
We all thought
she was a serial killer.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.939
Worst Valentine's ever.

26:34.549 --> 26:37.639
Focus on Wales and Olson.
Find another link.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.728
Well, we better
do it fast, boss.

26:39.772 --> 26:42.557
I got a call from
Detective Logan at MPD.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.125
His superiors are rumbling
about jurisdiction.[cell phone ringing]

26:45.168 --> 26:47.388
They want Olson's body
and the evidence back.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.825
Hold them off long as you can.

26:49.869 --> 26:53.176
Kasie. Yeah. On my way down.KASIE: Gibbs.

26:55.788 --> 26:58.138
Kase, what do you got?Oh, sorry, Gibbs.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.574
While I was
waiting for you,

26:59.618 --> 27:01.881
I was working on a little
side project for Sloane.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.579
Sloane asked you to do that?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.450
[scoffs]
Actually, it was my idea.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.670
I can't have a secret admirer
on my watch.

27:08.714 --> 27:11.934
I'm a forensic scientist.
I have to know. [chuckles]

27:11.978 --> 27:14.633
You know, actually,
between you and me,

27:14.676 --> 27:17.157
it would save me
a lot of trouble

27:17.200 --> 27:19.638
if the person who sent it
just admitted to it.

27:19.681 --> 27:22.858
I wouldn't tell anybody.
It could just be

27:22.902 --> 27:25.948
our little secret.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.910
[laughs]Okay, moving on.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.216
So I just tested
some hair samples...

27:33.260 --> 27:35.131
Yeah, yeah,
she's innocent. I know.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.916
Not Stacy's hair;
our victims'.

27:36.959 --> 27:40.397
Jimmy sent me Wales' and Olson's
tissue samples to analyze,

27:40.441 --> 27:42.269
but the results
were inconclusive.

27:42.312 --> 27:43.705
Since I was testing
Stacy's hair,

27:43.749 --> 27:46.621
I tested theirs, too,
and found this.

27:47.491 --> 27:49.929
What is it?Methamphetamine.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.974
Wales and Olson
were on meth?

27:52.018 --> 27:55.325
Cheap stuff, too, which explains
the damage to their organs.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.110
In fact, the meth
in their system

27:57.153 --> 27:58.546
had the exact same
chemical composition,

27:58.589 --> 28:01.854
which means we found
another link between them.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.594
They got the same dealer.[cell phone ringing]

28:03.638 --> 28:05.596
And we have another suspect.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.816
Whoever sold them the meth
could be our killer.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.470
Hey, Phil.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.690

28:55.342 --> 28:57.039
it's my fault.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.649
I should've trusted her.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.043
We didn't help much.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.045
I was so lucky
when I met Stacy.

29:03.089 --> 29:05.831
I met her, and suddenly
I didn't feel so alone.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.397
[chuckles] You know?

29:08.572 --> 29:10.400
I don't know.

29:10.444 --> 29:13.142
Maybe I should be more like you.

29:13.186 --> 29:16.102
The lone wolf. Huh?[chuckling]

29:16.145 --> 29:18.539
Go the "Way of the Gibbs."
[laughs]

29:18.582 --> 29:21.760
Come on, seems
to work for you.
Eh.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.371
Doesn't always work that way.

29:25.415 --> 29:26.590
You get lonely?

29:26.634 --> 29:31.421
Well... I mean, I'm busy.

29:31.465 --> 29:34.773
I mean, I got work and the boat.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.039
Sometimes that's not enough.

29:40.082 --> 29:43.129
Think you'd ever get back
into a relationship?

29:43.172 --> 29:44.826
Oh, I don't know.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.394
Been there.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.788
Not sure I'm cut out for that.

29:49.831 --> 29:53.356
But, hell, Phil, you are.

29:53.400 --> 29:57.143
Yeah, well, what am I
supposed to do, Gibbs?

29:57.186 --> 30:00.450
Stacy won't see me. I lost her.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.409
Get her back.

30:02.452 --> 30:04.063
Don't give up.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.455
She's worth fighting for, right?

30:05.499 --> 30:08.110
Yeah, yeah.[cell phone ringing]

30:08.154 --> 30:09.851
Get her back.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.113
Yeah? Gibbs.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.854
Uh, boss, we may
have something here.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.291
So, remember how
Stacy told us

30:15.335 --> 30:17.293
Wales was obsessed
with working out?

30:17.337 --> 30:20.079
Torres checked the cameras at
the gym and found footage of him

30:20.122 --> 30:21.776
with somebody
doing a transaction.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.864
It could be our dealer.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.866
Did Olson work out
at the same gym?

30:24.910 --> 30:26.955
McGEE: No, he went to
a different one across town,

30:26.999 --> 30:28.522
but I checked their cameras,

30:28.565 --> 30:30.350
and the same guy
showed up there as well.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.873
Kasie used facial
recognition

30:31.917 --> 30:34.180
and I.D.'d him as
Matthew Duques.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.921
Runs a nutritional
store in town.

30:35.964 --> 30:39.402
Okay, get Torres, pick him up.
Meet you back at the office.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.015
I got to go, okay?
Yeah.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.017
Hey, don't drink all the milk.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.322
Yeah, okay.

30:46.366 --> 30:47.889
[door opens]

30:47.933 --> 30:50.761
So, this is where our
meth dealer works?

30:50.805 --> 30:53.764
Yeah, what were you expecting?Not a nutrition store.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.941
Well, at least now
you can stock up on supplies.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.160
[laughs] Okay.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.817
Uh, Mr. Duques?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.514
NCIS.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.342
I got him.

31:06.386 --> 31:09.041
Torres, wait.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.221
[grunts]

31:17.049 --> 31:19.094
[grunts]

31:19.138 --> 31:20.791
Oh, man.[grunting]

31:23.925 --> 31:26.058
[groans]

31:28.147 --> 31:30.062
[groans]

31:30.105 --> 31:32.064
[panting]

31:32.107 --> 31:33.979
[gun cocks]
Freeze!

31:39.593 --> 31:41.073
The hell was that?

31:41.116 --> 31:43.075
What part of "limited duty"
don't you understand?

31:43.118 --> 31:44.772
So I got a little tired.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.905
Yeah, and because of you,
our suspect almost got away.

31:46.948 --> 31:47.906
But he didn't.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.082
But he could have.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.214
What are you trying to prove?

31:52.258 --> 31:55.000
You need to rest, Nick.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.263
Slow down.

31:57.306 --> 32:00.092
Nobody will think
any less of you.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.707
This is a mistake.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.796
I'm an honest businessman.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.973
Okay, well, honest
businessmen don't run.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.584
And they don't sell meth
hidden in pills.

32:16.195 --> 32:18.414
Found that in your back room.

32:18.458 --> 32:21.374
Had it analyzed.
Five percent meth by volume.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.072
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:24.116 --> 32:26.683
You recognize these men?

32:28.250 --> 32:31.993
No. Should I?

32:32.037 --> 32:33.473
Yeah, probably.

32:33.516 --> 32:35.040
They're two of
your customers.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.998
BISHOP:
So, what happened?

32:37.042 --> 32:39.261
They found out that you were
selling them cheap meth?

32:39.305 --> 32:42.177
They confronted you,
and then you killed them?

32:42.221 --> 32:43.570
Wait, what?

32:43.613 --> 32:45.572
Th-These guys are dead?

32:45.615 --> 32:48.053
It's a hell of a complaint
department you got there.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.619
No.

32:49.663 --> 32:52.361
No, no. You-you got this
all wrong.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.189
No, what we've got
is you on tape

32:54.233 --> 32:55.625
selling meth to our victims.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.888
No, I-I wasn't
selling them meth.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.064
Then what were you selling them?

32:59.107 --> 33:01.718
They saw my ad on
the dating app.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.634
They said they wanted something
to give them a little boost,

33:04.678 --> 33:07.246
make them more appealing
to the ladies.

33:08.334 --> 33:11.554
So I sold them
my virility supplements.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.121
They just happen
to have meth in them.

33:13.165 --> 33:15.645
Ginkgo biloba
wasn't cutting it?

33:16.733 --> 33:19.040
Okay. [sighs]

33:19.084 --> 33:23.044
I may have used, let's say,
some more powerful ingredients

33:23.088 --> 33:24.785
to get a stronger effect.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.353
But I'm a supplements
manufacturer.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.703
I'm not a murderer.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.400
You believe him?
[sighs]

33:31.444 --> 33:34.142
If he is telling the truth,
imagine the irony.

33:34.186 --> 33:37.580
In trying to make themselves
more appealing, Wales and Olson

33:37.624 --> 33:40.844
were slowly killing themselves
without even knowing it.

33:40.888 --> 33:42.107
[cell phone ringing]

33:42.150 --> 33:43.717
Oh, man.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.979
Everything all right?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.415
Yeah, it's Phil.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.417
Probably just wants
some more relationship advice.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.897
From you?

33:51.246 --> 33:52.247
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs?

33:52.291 --> 33:54.032
We have a problem.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.772
While searching
Duques's belongings,

33:55.816 --> 33:58.645
we found a prescription
for hydromorphone.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.168
That's a heavy-duty painkiller.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.257
Yeah, apparently, he was
taking it for his shoulder.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.129
He tore his rotator cuff
about six months ago.

34:04.172 --> 34:06.870
He was in an accident,
and he never healed.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.524
Ah. So with a bum shoulder...

34:08.568 --> 34:10.265
No way he could handle
the bow and arrow.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.267
He's not our guy.

34:12.311 --> 34:13.877
[cell phone ringing]

34:15.792 --> 34:17.185
Hey, Phil?
It's not a great time.

34:17.229 --> 34:18.839
Oh, Gibbs, thank God.
I don't know what to do.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.101
Slow down, Phil.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.363
What-what's going on?

34:21.407 --> 34:22.843
I went by Stacy's house
to patch things up,

34:22.886 --> 34:25.237
and her house
had been broken into.[clattering]

34:25.280 --> 34:27.108
I think whoever did it
might still be here.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.675
Phil, listen to me.

34:28.718 --> 34:30.503
Hang up the phone
and get out of there.

34:30.546 --> 34:31.678
You understand?[phone beeps]

34:31.721 --> 34:33.723
Phil!

34:42.384 --> 34:43.994
[door opens]GIBBS: Phil!

34:44.038 --> 34:45.518
Phil!

34:47.172 --> 34:49.043
[dog barking in distance]

34:51.654 --> 34:52.829
Bedrooms are clear.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.179
No sign of them in
the rest of the house.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.268
BOLO, now.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.052
NCIS!
Whoa!

34:58.096 --> 34:59.401
Whoa, don't shoot.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.969
Sheriff? What are
you doing here?

35:02.012 --> 35:03.579
Stacy called me.
She said she was in trouble.

35:03.623 --> 35:04.928
I rushed right over.

35:04.972 --> 35:07.322
Well, why did she call you?

35:09.063 --> 35:11.500
You got something to
say, I'd say it now.

35:11.544 --> 35:15.113
Because I'm the only one
that knows her secret.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.290
[sighs]

35:18.333 --> 35:20.292
Stacy killed her husband.

35:21.771 --> 35:23.251
It was late June,

35:23.295 --> 35:24.861
around suppertime.

35:24.905 --> 35:27.168
Stacy came to my place sobbing,
covered in blood.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.692
Told me Mark had been
on one of his benders

35:29.736 --> 35:31.651
and had gotten
particularly nasty with her.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.174
Physically abusive?

35:33.218 --> 35:35.263
It had been going on for years.

35:35.307 --> 35:38.614
Hell, I always thought she'd
be the one dead before him.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.617
Not that night. She fought back.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.053
He was choking her.

35:43.097 --> 35:45.752
She grabbed a poker
and hit him over the head.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.536
Poor thing was so scared,
she didn't even wait

35:47.580 --> 35:48.842
to see him drop.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.887
She just ran
straight over to my place.

35:50.931 --> 35:54.195
I went over to check on him,
found him dead.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.197
So to protect her,
you changed the report,

35:56.241 --> 35:58.068
made it look like an accident?

35:58.112 --> 36:00.070
[sighs]

36:00.114 --> 36:04.205
I knew I should've never given
you those crime scene photos.

36:04.249 --> 36:07.948
Why change the report at all?
I mean, it was self-defense.

36:07.991 --> 36:11.212
You don't know Mark's family.
They're vindictive.

36:11.256 --> 36:14.389
They would've brought her into
court and made her life hell.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.304
I couldn't let that
happen to her.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.741
That poor woman had already
been through enough.

36:18.785 --> 36:21.091
And no one else knows
about this?

36:21.135 --> 36:24.312
No. Course, Mark's family,

36:24.356 --> 36:27.010
they all blamed her
for what happened.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.622
All except one cousin,
I remember.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.754
Always thought he
had a sweet spot

36:31.798 --> 36:33.321
for her.

36:33.365 --> 36:35.062
You remember his name?

36:35.105 --> 36:37.107
I only met him a few times.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.762
Logan.

36:39.806 --> 36:42.809
Tom Logan. I heard
something about him

36:42.852 --> 36:45.464
moving up here
to become an MPD detective.

36:46.813 --> 36:49.250
All right, got it. Thanks.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.644
MPD says Logan never
showed up for work.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.212
Now, I've got his home address,
but he also has a cabin.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.344
Hit the cabin first.[groaning]

36:57.432 --> 36:59.304
You guys go ahead without me.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.307
Torres, you okay?

37:04.396 --> 37:06.093
I need to get
some rest, man. I...

37:06.136 --> 37:08.313
I'm not gonna be any good
to you guys like this.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.270
I'll meet you at the office.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.532
Good.

37:11.490 --> 37:14.362
[engine starts]

37:17.147 --> 37:19.193
[grunts]

37:21.848 --> 37:25.199
Tom, please don't do this.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.332
LOGAN:
I should've never
brought you here.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.029
I-I, uh...
[chuckles]

37:29.072 --> 37:33.163
I killed the others
at night.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.295
They were by themselves.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.037
This-this-this was i-im...

37:37.080 --> 37:38.821
impulsive.
I'm not impulsive.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.867
No, you're psychotic.

37:42.347 --> 37:45.306
Tom. Why are you doing this?

37:46.351 --> 37:48.353
For you, Stacy.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.966
I-I...

37:53.009 --> 37:55.229
I love you.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.363
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.191
I couldn't just watch

38:01.235 --> 38:03.542
and do nothing
while men hurt you.

38:03.585 --> 38:06.719
I had to hurt them back.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.025
Like I did with Mark.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.811
Mark? I don't...

38:11.854 --> 38:15.380
I-I went over the house
after you left.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.730
He was still alive.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.385
I put an end to that.[sighs]

38:20.428 --> 38:21.951
You killed him?

38:22.996 --> 38:25.085
So we could be together.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.437
We will never be together.

38:30.482 --> 38:32.266
Huh?

38:33.441 --> 38:37.184
Well... really?

38:37.227 --> 38:40.100
And here I was, thinking
I'd only have to kill him.

38:47.281 --> 38:48.978
Logan's cabin?

38:49.022 --> 38:51.546
Cabin J, just down here
to the right.

38:54.201 --> 38:57.422
I'm sorry to get you
involved in all this, Phil.

38:57.465 --> 39:01.948
I'm sorry, too,
for not trusting you.

39:01.991 --> 39:05.995
If it means anything,
I was falling in love with you.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.389
LOGAN:
[grunts] Okay.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.260
Let's get this over with.

39:10.304 --> 39:11.610
Tom, please don't.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.656
Don't worry.
I'll be right behind you.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.616
I don't want to live in
this world without you.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.534
Uh, wait. Before you
go through with this,

39:22.577 --> 39:25.885
have you thought about
the tax implications?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.583
The what?

39:28.627 --> 39:30.585
Well, you're-you're planning
on killing yourself, right?

39:30.629 --> 39:33.022
As an accountant,
I'd advise you to at least wait

39:33.066 --> 39:35.242
until you have
your estate plan in place.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.549
I don't care about
any of that stuff.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.246
Oh, but your beneficiaries will.

39:39.289 --> 39:40.639
Come on, Tom.
You come from

39:40.682 --> 39:41.901
a big family, right?

39:41.944 --> 39:43.468
I'm sure you got
a favorite niece or nephew.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.034
He does. Little Bobby Jr.

39:45.078 --> 39:46.688
PHIL:
Little Bobby Jr.!

39:46.732 --> 39:47.994
Well, you wouldn't
want Little Bobby Jr.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.909
not getting what's
coming to him, right?

39:49.952 --> 39:52.041
And then there's the death tax.
You know about that, right?

39:52.085 --> 39:53.782
No.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.523
Oh, Tom, come on.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.917
You got to reduce your assets
below the threshold,

39:57.960 --> 39:59.919
or those taxes
will kill you, Tom.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.703
Kill you. No pun intended.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.444
Enough!

40:03.488 --> 40:04.880
Say goodbye.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.316
[door opens]

40:07.492 --> 40:08.797
[gunshot]

40:17.545 --> 40:18.807
You both okay?

40:18.851 --> 40:20.679
Oh, Gibbs, thank God.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.116
I was running out
of accounting tricks.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.514
[knocking on door]

40:29.557 --> 40:31.820
Excuse me.
Are you Jacqueline Sloane?

40:31.864 --> 40:33.953
Yes. Hi. How can I help you?

40:33.996 --> 40:36.564
I think those are for me.

40:36.608 --> 40:38.784
Uh, I'm sorry?

40:38.827 --> 40:42.352
I'm Sloane Jackston.
I work in HR.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.355
My husband's overseas and
sent me a Valentine's gift,

40:45.399 --> 40:46.574
but I think the courier

40:46.618 --> 40:48.881
must have sent it
to you instead.

40:48.924 --> 40:51.753
Oh. Right.

40:51.797 --> 40:53.059
[laughs softly]

40:53.102 --> 40:55.540
Can I have them back?

40:55.583 --> 40:57.542
Oh, yes, of course. Of course.

40:57.585 --> 41:01.502
I'm sorry.
I ate some of the chocolates.

41:01.546 --> 41:02.851
Most of them, actually.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.158
That's all right.
I ate most of yours, too.

41:05.201 --> 41:06.986
Hmm?

41:07.029 --> 41:10.163
The card fell behind my desk
when they delivered it.

41:10.206 --> 41:13.645
I-I only found it today. That's
how I knew to come to you.

41:13.688 --> 41:16.082
Wow. Thank you so much.

41:16.125 --> 41:18.606
Well, nice meeting you.

41:18.650 --> 41:19.868
Happy belated Valentine's.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.827
Yes, you, too.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.928
[sighs]

41:37.669 --> 41:39.801
[mouths]

41:39.845 --> 41:41.847
[knocking on door]

41:44.893 --> 41:46.242
Hey. Phil.

41:46.286 --> 41:47.853
Hey, Gibbs.How are you? Come on in.

41:47.896 --> 41:50.290
Good. Good. I can't stay.
I'm, uh, picking up Stacy.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.118
We are going out to dinner.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.989
She took you back?[laughs]:
Yeah. Yeah.

41:54.033 --> 41:55.425
I got you
to thank for that.

41:55.469 --> 41:57.079
And for, uh, saving my life.

41:57.123 --> 41:59.081
Well, you never sing
in my house again, we're even.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.692
[chuckles]
All right. Oh, here.

42:00.735 --> 42:01.867
I got you this.

42:01.910 --> 42:03.303
I created a profile for you

42:03.346 --> 42:05.000
on Fleet Date,
using some old photos

42:05.044 --> 42:06.567
I took last year
at your cabin.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.961
I figured the app worked for me,
maybe it'll work for you.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.789
Phil, it's not me.

42:10.832 --> 42:12.355
That won't even
work on my phone.

42:12.399 --> 42:14.793
Yeah, I know. That's why
I bought you a new phone.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.751
Okay? Look, you don't
have to use the app now.

42:16.795 --> 42:18.361
Just think about it.
If you ever get lonely,

42:18.405 --> 42:20.102
you just hit that button, okay?

42:20.146 --> 42:21.408
Who knows?
Maybe you'll find love, too.

42:21.451 --> 42:22.757
Who knows?All right.

42:22.801 --> 42:24.933
I got to run.
I'll call you later.Okay.

42:24.977 --> 42:27.588
Right.
Yeah.

42:27.632 --> 42:29.242
[chuckles]Call.

42:29.285 --> 42:31.636
Yeah.Do it.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.768
"Do it."
