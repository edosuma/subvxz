[applause]

And you may now kiss the bride
a second time.

-Why not?

DAVID:
Your mom just wanted us

01:41.449 --> 01:42.885
to chat, that's all.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.669
See how you're doing.

Uh, we're fine.

I-I don't know
what she wants from us.

I do.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.067

01:52.068 --> 01:53.722
DAVID: Getting
a lot of pressure for kids?

01:53.765 --> 01:55.202
MAN:
Define "a lot."

01:55.245 --> 01:57.508
It's my mom.
She's a bit high-maintenance.

01:57.552 --> 02:00.468
Mm. Well, you, you have
to set your boundaries.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.513
You know, it's your home.

Hello?

02:06.778 --> 02:08.432
Sister Andrea?

02:08.476 --> 02:11.000
Can I help you?

02:11.043 --> 02:12.436
ANDREA:
Oh.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.395
I'm sorry, Father.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.440
I left something in here.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.225
Please excuse me.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.097
Oh, hello.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.403
I know you two, don't I?

02:22.446 --> 02:25.014
Yes, Sister Andrea. I'm Leo.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.190
That's right.
High school calculus.

02:27.234 --> 02:28.931
You were terrible.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.150
[both laugh]

02:30.193 --> 02:31.977
LEO:
Guess what I'm doing now.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.676
-Teaching calculus?
-No, I-I'm a sound recordist.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.765
But once
I did have to use calculus.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.767
Well, I'm very proud of you.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.464

[demon snarling softly]

03:07.578 --> 03:09.189
I'm Amalia.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.800
Uh, Sister,
remember the one that kept

03:11.843 --> 03:14.368
smoking in the bathroom?
[chuckles]

03:14.411 --> 03:15.891
-DAVID: Sister?
-Yes.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.806
Yes, Amalia, yes.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.111
Are you okay?

03:20.156 --> 03:22.158
David, could I see you
for a second?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.378
-Now?
-Yes.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.857
AMALIA: I hope you're not
holding my smoking against me,

03:25.901 --> 03:27.424
Sister. I don't smoke anymore.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.991
ANDREA:
No, no, Amalia.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.688
It's just a spiritual matter.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.473
We'll be right back.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.257
-[snarls]
-[door closes]

03:35.693 --> 03:38.348
-There's a demon in there.
-There's...?

03:38.392 --> 03:41.046
-What does that mean?
-It means

03:41.090 --> 03:42.918
there's a demon in there
between them.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.268
It has its hands
on their shoulders.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.792
-I didn't see anything.
-Because you're not as good.

03:48.793 --> 03:49.881
Look at your feet.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.796
What do you see?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.189
DAVID:
My feet.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.322
No. There's a trail

03:55.365 --> 03:57.062
of slime here.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.891
-Like a snail.
-Are you sure?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.719
Don't patronize me.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.591
-What do you want me to do?
-I want you to find out

04:03.634 --> 04:05.201
what the issue is.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.421
There's something possessed
in their marriage.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.292
They've only been married
a week.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.337
It doesn't matter
if it's an hour.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.817
Find out what the issue is.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.820
-And if there's nothing?
-Then I'm wrong, Father.

04:15.864 --> 04:19.520
And I should just clean up
your room.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.870
Hi. Uh, Sister Andrea's here
to take notes.

04:21.913 --> 04:25.265
Uh, she's
a valuable consultant on, uh...

04:25.308 --> 04:26.744
marital issues.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.311
LEO:
I don't think

04:28.355 --> 04:29.747
we really have
any marital issues.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.227
-[demon snarling]
-We were just joking

04:31.271 --> 04:32.794
-about our in-laws.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.753
Is it an intimacy issue?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.321
Fuck you.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.323
DAVID: If, uh,
if you don't feel comfortable...

04:40.367 --> 04:42.369
No, uh, it's not that.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.066
You know

04:44.109 --> 04:46.634
that we saved ourselves
for marriage, Father.

04:47.635 --> 04:48.766
Well, now...

04:48.810 --> 04:50.768
now that we're married,

04:50.812 --> 04:54.163
we're having... sexual issues.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.251
[shouts]

04:56.339 --> 04:58.428
DAVID: Do you feel comfortable
talking about it?

04:58.472 --> 04:59.777
Or I could recommend

04:59.821 --> 05:00.822
-a mental health professional.
-No.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.476
We don't want that.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.741
Whenever we try

05:06.784 --> 05:09.352
to be intimate...

05:09.396 --> 05:11.441
We have a physical reaction.

05:11.485 --> 05:14.270
-Like we're...
-We're allergic to each other.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.707
Uh, I break out, and I...

05:16.751 --> 05:19.014
-My stomach. I-It's ridiculous.
-DAVID: Okay.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.582
This is sounding
more like a medical condition,

05:21.625 --> 05:23.105
not a spiritual one.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.716
[laughs]

05:25.760 --> 05:27.501
-[grunts]
-DAVID: We have an assessor

05:27.544 --> 05:28.850
-I could get a reference from.
-ANDREA: Actually,

05:28.893 --> 05:31.156
Father, I think
it's better if the Church

05:31.200 --> 05:33.420
do a thorough assessment
before recommending

05:33.463 --> 05:35.639
-a doctor.
-Sister, I-I disagree.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.989
I-I think this is sounding
more like a medical condition.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.209
ANDREA:
No. Leo, Amalia,

05:40.252 --> 05:42.429
this allergic reaction
that you have.

05:42.472 --> 05:46.084
Do you have any premonition

05:46.128 --> 05:47.738
-of something dark?
-[snarls]

05:47.782 --> 05:50.480
-What do you mean?
-Yeah. What do you mean, bitch?

05:50.524 --> 05:53.962
Do you have a sense in your
marriage of something demonic?

05:54.005 --> 05:56.094
Sister, perhaps we should talk
about this later.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.227
Leo. Amalia.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.145
Show them.

06:03.188 --> 06:08.019
Uh, that's why my mom
wanted us to see you, Father.

06:08.063 --> 06:11.806
She said that you deal
with issues like these.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.156
Issues like...?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.378
This is what happened
last time in bed.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.344
Food allergy. I didn't do that.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.216
AMALIA: I could feel
fingernails clawing into me.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.609
Uh-- We had to stop.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.394
-You don't have a pet?
-LEO: No.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.701
And I didn't do it.
It just suddenly appeared.

06:39.094 --> 06:42.750
Help us, Father. We...
don't know what's going on.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.407
â™ª

07:04.946 --> 07:07.122
Is that even possible, that
a marriage can be possessed?

07:07.165 --> 07:08.732
DAVID: Well, officially,
it's diabolical oppression,

07:08.776 --> 07:10.473
which is why we need you.

07:10.517 --> 07:13.737
It might just be a psychological
reaction to a new marriage.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.566
Right, so I'd be there to see if
it's just marital dysfunction?

07:16.610 --> 07:18.350
Yes. They were virgins
when they got married.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.875
-Really?
-So there could be

07:20.918 --> 07:22.790
a therapeutic answer
for their physical reactions.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.966
What are their
physical reactions?

07:25.009 --> 07:26.576
-[clears throat]
-Hives. And nausea.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.230
Well, that sounds
to be expected, right?

07:28.273 --> 07:29.492
Just one thing.

07:29.536 --> 07:33.409
The hives are in the form
of claw marks.

07:35.019 --> 07:38.327
Okay. Um, tomorrow?

07:38.370 --> 07:39.546
See you then.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.375
So, um, the door
to the master bedroom

07:43.419 --> 07:45.465
would be right there?

07:45.508 --> 07:47.597
And the master bathroom
would be adjoining.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.381
Uh-huh. And how long
is all this gonna take?

07:49.425 --> 07:51.079
Two or three months.

07:51.122 --> 07:54.691
Okay, well, let me look
at these overnight.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.607
I do need an answer.
I have other jobs.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.392
And you will have
an answer tomorrow.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.351
[pipes rumbling]

08:02.394 --> 08:05.006
I also do plumbing. You want me
to take a look upstairs?

08:05.049 --> 08:06.486
No, I've got someone.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.618
LAURA:
You're making it unhappy.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.881
Yeah, well,
you're making me unhappy.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.579
What did you guys put down here?

08:12.622 --> 08:14.276
-A kid from school.
-Yeah, but a short one.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.495
What is that?

08:15.538 --> 08:17.148
-It's a snake.
-What does it do?

08:17.192 --> 08:19.237
Don't you guys have homework
to do or something?

08:19.281 --> 08:21.326
Have you noticed you're not
very magnificent lately?

08:21.370 --> 08:22.980
Yeah, you used to think
we were funny.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.678
Yeah, well,
you used to be funny.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.244
Your shoes don't match.

08:28.377 --> 08:31.075
Ben the Magnificent,
you are falling apart.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.034
Yeah, okay. You know what?
I need to do this on my own.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.339
Could you guys go away?

08:35.471 --> 08:37.342
[all shouting]

08:38.822 --> 08:41.129
Whoa!

08:41.172 --> 08:42.434
[pipes rumbling]

08:46.526 --> 08:49.441
-How did that happen?
-I think it was an alligator.

08:49.485 --> 08:50.791
I told you it's haunted.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.836
Okay, would you just
shut up, please?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.403
[all exclaiming]

08:54.446 --> 08:56.492
We are not supposed to say that.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.928
What, "please"?

08:59.451 --> 09:00.496
[grunts]

09:02.367 --> 09:04.892
No.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.328
I think that's why you're sad.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.591
What?

09:08.635 --> 09:10.027
You can't figure it out anymore.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.552
Things have gotten weird.
And you don't like it.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.731
-Where'd you get all that?
-From my psychology class.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.777
It's called
cultural derealization.

09:20.821 --> 09:24.128
It's when you become depressed
by how weird the world is.

09:24.694 --> 09:25.782
[grunts]

09:25.826 --> 09:27.784
LAURA:
Oh, my God. Are you hurt?

I think you should...

09:28.959 --> 09:31.092
[overlapping chatter]

09:31.135 --> 09:32.876
This is getting dangerous.

Hey, Mom.

-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

10:13.787 --> 10:17.529
No, you were chanting.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.141
-Was it from Leland?
-No, Mom, no.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.318
And you got this
out of my closet?

10:23.361 --> 10:25.276
Lexis.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.235
I told you about Leland.
He's attacking this family.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.673
No, this isn't
about Leland, Mom.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.849
-It's about Lynn.
-What?

10:32.893 --> 10:35.417
I told you that Lynn
was dating Ren,

10:35.460 --> 10:38.681
and I... look,
I wasn't supposed to.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.509
Wait, so Lynn
made you wear this?

10:40.552 --> 10:42.859
Yeah, but it was me.
I wasn't supposed to tell you.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.948
-What, the truth?
-Yeah, but it's okay, Mom.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.384
I don't mind-- Mom!

-No, you did something.
-This is all your fault.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.870
You ate all the cookies
last night.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.698
No, girls.
Everyone just sit on the couch,

10:55.742 --> 10:57.395
-normally for once.
-Can I sit on the floor?

10:57.439 --> 10:58.962
-Normal sitting.
-My young body

10:59.006 --> 11:01.530
-cannot fit on this couch.
-Okay.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.706
Remember when I told you
I was gonna treat you like

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
-more mature girls?
-Uh-huh.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.231
So that's what
we're dealing with right now.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.493
What's this about?

11:08.537 --> 11:09.843
That's from your closet.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.540
-I didn't take it.
-Why was Lexis wearing it

11:11.583 --> 11:13.498
-while chanting?
-What did you say to her?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.979
No, this is not about Lexis,
this is about us as a family.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.807
Okay? Lynn, you're the oldest.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.243
You're supposed to be
setting an example.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.376
Why are you punishing Lexis?

11:21.419 --> 11:22.986
-I'm not punishing her. Hold on.
-Yes, you are.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.902
You told us, Mom,
to support each other.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.730
Family is more important
than anything.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.471
-Yeah, you said that...
-And what Lexis did

11:29.514 --> 11:31.691
hurt one of us. Me.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.562
No, Lexis told the truth.
She made you tell the truth.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.825
But she did it because
she wanted to hurt me.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.609
I'm feeling a little
attacked here...

11:37.653 --> 11:39.829
[overlapping chatter]

11:41.526 --> 11:43.528
Okay, quiet!

11:43.572 --> 11:44.791
This is what we're gonna do.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.923
Everybody be quiet until I talk.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.362
-What's she gonna do, hit us?
-LAURA: It's not even my fault.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.495
-Like, Lexis told.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.888
-Yeah, it's Lexis's fault.
-Guys, can we just please

11:54.931 --> 11:56.498
be quiet?
I don't want to hear this.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.587
-You said, you said...
-Shut up!

11:58.630 --> 12:01.068
-Quiet!
-...her fault!

12:02.112 --> 12:04.462
I'm creating a Ten Commandments
for this family.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.855
-What?
-Ten rules

12:05.899 --> 12:08.162
that must be followed,
no matter what.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.251
But the nuns say we have
ten commandments already.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.556
Yeah, but my girls
aren't following them.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.863
So this is the first one.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.126
Thou shalt

12:16.170 --> 12:18.694
not ever

12:18.738 --> 12:22.872
lie to Mom.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.311
Do we all understand that?

12:27.355 --> 12:29.574
-Yes.
-Yes. What?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.533
Is it all right to lie
to other people?

12:31.576 --> 12:32.882
No.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.842
What if we have Jews
in our basement?

12:35.885 --> 12:36.843
-Oh, my God.
-Or Trump with immigrants.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.801
-Yeah.
-Okay, look,

12:38.845 --> 12:40.194
as real as these examples are,
we're just gonna

12:40.237 --> 12:41.804
have to figure it out as we go.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.502
Okay? But what's most important?

12:44.546 --> 12:47.288
ALL: "Thou shalt not
ever lie to Mom."

12:47.331 --> 12:49.856
Very good.
All right, number two.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.472
ALL:
"If Leland approaches you,

12:57.515 --> 12:59.517
-tell Mom."
-Beautiful.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.997
Number three.

13:06.829 --> 13:10.093
ALL: "Do not go
into Mom's closet."

13:10.137 --> 13:11.834
There are a lot
of commandments about you.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.662
Yeah, because until you're 18
and I kick you all out,

13:13.705 --> 13:15.882
I'm the most important
person here. Okay?

13:15.925 --> 13:17.666
[pipes rumbling]

13:17.709 --> 13:19.320
Uh, Mom, I think
Ben needs our help.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.975
Hey, stay.
Which leads us to number four.

13:22.018 --> 13:25.239
"Do not interrupt Mom."

13:28.024 --> 13:30.635
[grunts]
Piece of shit.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.968
[toilet flushes]

14:09.065 --> 14:11.111
[pipes rumbling]

14:22.905 --> 14:24.124
Ben, are you okay?

14:27.823 --> 14:30.478
No, I'm not.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.092
â™ª

15:02.205 --> 15:04.120
â™ª

15:24.793 --> 15:26.838
â™ª

15:44.378 --> 15:46.902
â™ª

16:00.002 --> 16:01.525
NARRATOR: While dollar bills
are traded through a bank,

16:01.569 --> 16:03.310
Makob is traded peer to peer.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.702
Once you have Makobs,
what can you do with them?

16:04.746 --> 16:06.530
Spend them.
More and more retailers

16:06.574 --> 16:09.055
are accepting Makob
as a method of payment.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.621
You can purchase anything
from computer parts,

16:10.665 --> 16:12.797
toiletries to pet supplies.

16:12.841 --> 16:16.540
In a global economy,
Makob is the new frontier.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.545
-Makob? What is that?
-LELAND: It's a coin.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.895
A cryptocurrency. Like Bitcoin.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.767
Like Doge. Like Ethereum.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.987
But this one is Makob, see?

16:28.030 --> 16:29.466
It's real. It's solid.

16:29.510 --> 16:33.731
And it's trading
for $11.30 per coin.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.038
That trades for eleven dollars?

16:36.082 --> 16:39.172
No, it's like a billboard
for the real thing.

16:39.215 --> 16:42.218
The real thing is in here.

16:42.262 --> 16:46.527
So, your goal this week
is to get Makob

16:46.570 --> 16:49.921
to trade for $135 per coin.

16:50.966 --> 16:51.923
Wait.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.926
$135 for what?

16:54.970 --> 16:56.145
It's-it's not real.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.800
-What is real?
-I-- Okay.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.237
This desk, my purse,
but not, but not that.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.109
I can sell anything.

17:03.152 --> 17:06.634
But if it's just there,
uh, how do I do that?

17:06.677 --> 17:08.418
That's up to you.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.291
You have a team of 30 employees,
all minimum wage millennials

17:11.334 --> 17:14.772
with meaningless promises
of stock options.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.470
-[fingers snap]
-SHERYL: They all work for me?

17:16.513 --> 17:17.906
LELAND:
They work for Makob.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.822
And this is your
executive assistant...

17:20.865 --> 17:22.998
-Taylor.
-Hello, ma'am.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.782
-I'm Sheryl.
-LELAND: Got to go.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.481
Remember that moment
in Working Girl

17:27.524 --> 17:29.744
where Harrison Ford says,
"Make me money

17:29.787 --> 17:31.963
-or I'm gonna kill you"?
-Mm, no.

17:32.007 --> 17:36.316
Well, get Makob up to $135
or I'm gonna kill you.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.319
[laughs]

17:39.362 --> 17:42.931
Taylor will keep me posted
on your progress.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.151
So, Taylor, um,

17:45.194 --> 17:48.328
why don't you call the team
together and we can get...

17:49.459 --> 17:52.245
Taylor?
[chuckles]

17:54.464 --> 17:56.423
-Taylor?
-Okay, Boomer.

18:00.296 --> 18:03.125
Um...

18:03.169 --> 18:05.475
Hello, I'm-I'm Sheryl Luria.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.738
And I know
I-I'm new here, but...

18:09.218 --> 18:11.916
Everybody, uh...

18:11.960 --> 18:16.051
[laughs softly] Sorry,
I-I just need a minute, okay?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.966
I-I just want to say
there's-there's no

18:18.009 --> 18:19.359
bad ideas here, all right?

18:19.402 --> 18:20.795
I just want to hear
your thoughts,

18:20.838 --> 18:22.449
so why don't we all just
gather into my office

18:22.492 --> 18:24.755
-for a minute and...
-It's okay. Just keep working.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.453
Who are you?

18:26.496 --> 18:28.977
The office manager.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.545
The best thing for you to do
is go back to your office

18:31.588 --> 18:34.939
and do some online shopping
and let us do your work for you.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.028
Okay, Boomer?

18:43.078 --> 18:44.775
[sighs]

18:45.733 --> 18:48.214
Mr. Hurt to the rescue!

18:48.257 --> 18:50.303
[phone ringing]

18:52.479 --> 18:54.394
[knocking on door]

18:54.437 --> 18:56.744
KARIMA: Come on, Ben. Answer
the phone, or open the door.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.833
I'm not leaving until you do
one or the other.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.400
-[phone buzzing]
-I've got two phones.

19:00.443 --> 19:01.879
I'm calling all of yours.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.229
[knocking on door]

19:03.272 --> 19:05.318
-Go away, Karima.
-Nope.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.972
KARIMA: In fact, I know
how to Skype you, too.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.932
[Skype ringing]

19:12.368 --> 19:14.849
[knocking on door]

19:22.422 --> 19:23.988
Oh, my God.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.077
How many phones do you have?

19:26.121 --> 19:27.514
As many as I need.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.429
What's going on with you?

19:29.472 --> 19:31.605
Nothing. It's called a siesta.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.302
Your little Catholic friends
called worried about you.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.218
There's an exorcism
or something they need you at.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.306
Hmm.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.527
Okay.

19:49.013 --> 19:52.060
Hey! Oh, oh...

19:52.103 --> 19:54.236
Okay, what the fuck?!

19:54.280 --> 19:55.411
-Get up.
-Why?

19:55.455 --> 19:56.847
Because you're worrying me.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.153
Look at yourself.
You look depressed.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.242
I am not depressed.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.204
I was diagnosed
as culturally derealized

20:05.247 --> 20:07.162
by a bunch of 12-year-olds.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.251
-Culturally...
-Derealized.

20:09.295 --> 20:13.603
It means disgusted
with the insanity of reality.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.390
-What insanity?
-Um, the cases

20:17.433 --> 20:21.437
that I have been trying to solve
that don't make any sense.

20:21.481 --> 20:24.527
Photos of angels,
a soul-weighing machine,

20:24.571 --> 20:27.487
my girlfriend
with a twin attached?

20:27.530 --> 20:33.319
I try to figure out these cases
that don't make any sense.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.844
And then we just move on
to the next thing.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.802
Okay.

20:38.846 --> 20:43.154
Ben, sit down.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.982
Actually, you know,
I was sitting down.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.028
-I was actually laying down.
-Listen to me.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.421
I'm taking you out tonight.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.250
W-What? Where?

20:51.293 --> 20:53.817
The Super Secret Science League.
It's a group.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.819
50 scientists and programmers
who examine the world.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.343
What the fuck
are you talking about?

20:57.386 --> 20:59.258
I'm inviting you.
You need to talk to people

20:59.301 --> 21:01.347
who talk your language,
who aren't shoving

21:01.390 --> 21:04.480
-angels and ghosts at you.
-Super Secret what?

21:04.524 --> 21:06.352
Science League. Ignore the name.
We're voting on a better name.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.920
Some people at work invited me,
so I'm inviting you.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.313
What is it, like, a Mensa thing?

21:11.357 --> 21:13.924
No, these are actually
smart people.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.752
Tonight. I'm taking you.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.754
You need a steadying influence.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.756
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

21:19.800 --> 21:23.978
Okay, and, um, you didn't live
together before your wedding?

21:24.021 --> 21:26.110
And how is that going?

21:26.154 --> 21:28.635
Sharing space,
being around each other more.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.027
We both had roommates before.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.855
College roommates. I had three.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.379
So we're used to living
with other people.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.903
All right.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.471
I'd love to try
some role-playing,

21:38.514 --> 21:39.689
if you're up for it.

21:39.733 --> 21:40.908
Would you get up?

21:40.951 --> 21:41.909
-Okay.
-Sure.

21:41.952 --> 21:42.910
This is gonna be good.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.215
Face each other.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.741
Who usually initiates sex?

21:50.439 --> 21:52.311
Probably me.

21:52.354 --> 21:55.096
Actually, I'd say equal.

21:55.139 --> 21:59.187
Amalia, why don't you act out
how Leo initiates sex?

21:59.230 --> 22:01.581
-AMALIA: Really? [laughs]
-Mm-hmm.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.931
Oh... Uh...

22:03.974 --> 22:07.456
Well, usually, uh,
he gets this...

22:07.500 --> 22:08.762
[demon growls]

22:08.805 --> 22:10.546
-[shouts]
-...look on his face.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.592
KRISTEN: Okay, okay, well,
act it out. Bring him into it.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.377
[grunting]

22:17.031 --> 22:18.467
[Amalia moaning]

22:18.511 --> 22:19.860
You did this.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.514
[soft chuckle]

22:26.127 --> 22:27.389
Sister, can I help you?

22:27.433 --> 22:29.391
No, David asked me
to take notes.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.350
Oh, I-I'm taking my own notes.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.482
Leo, Amalia.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.397
Hi.

22:35.441 --> 22:39.836
Um, could I talk to you
for just a minute?

22:39.880 --> 22:45.146
Sister, uh, marital therapy
is-is very sensitive.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.931
Yes, and it seems
to be going well.

22:47.975 --> 22:53.937
Yes, but only if the subjects
feel completely open.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.244
Kristen, right?

22:56.287 --> 22:57.680
Yeah.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.596
I'm not here to undercut
your therapy, ma'am,

23:00.640 --> 23:02.468
but there's a spiritual
component here that...

23:02.511 --> 23:04.513
And I would agree,
but the spiritual

23:04.557 --> 23:06.602
needs to come
after the pragmatic.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.038
I hadn't finished.

23:09.779 --> 23:14.001
There's a spiritual, and even
supernatural component here.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.003
That is how I can help you.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.310
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.312
Your, um...

23:21.356 --> 23:23.532
-presence, ma'am...
-Sister.

23:23.576 --> 23:27.536
Your presence, Sister,
is, um, well,

23:27.580 --> 23:30.234
it's keeping these newlyweds
from speaking honestly.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.193
I mean,
we are talking about sex,

23:32.236 --> 23:34.935
and a nun's presence
can keep these people

23:34.978 --> 23:37.764
from-from speaking
their minds freely.

23:37.807 --> 23:40.636
-Let me be blunt, ma'am...
-Doctor.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.725
Doctor.

23:42.769 --> 23:46.642
I can see something you cannot.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.166
There is a demon
between those two.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.560
It's trying to possess them.

23:51.604 --> 23:54.520
The good news here
is that it's in pain,

23:54.563 --> 23:57.218
and being diminished
by your questioning.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.874
How much are we speaking
metaphorically?

24:00.917 --> 24:03.267
I never speak metaphorically.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.532
You need me in there, Doctor.

24:06.575 --> 24:10.579
I can tell you when your therapy
is diminishing a demon,

24:10.623 --> 24:12.494
or encouraging one.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.932
Okay, this is what I say.

24:15.976 --> 24:20.110
If I feel like your presence
is keeping these newlyweds

24:20.154 --> 24:23.766
from speaking honestly, then
I need you to excuse yourself.

24:25.638 --> 24:28.162
I need you to agree with me.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.381
I agree with you.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.471
Good.

24:32.514 --> 24:36.170
I know you both
are religious, but...

24:36.213 --> 24:39.913
you know, sex is just between
the two of you.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.219
If you think of it
as something holy,

24:42.263 --> 24:44.570
[whispers]:
it can smother desire.

24:44.613 --> 24:45.919
[demon snarls]

24:45.962 --> 24:48.051
This is blasphemy.

24:48.095 --> 24:50.924
You're a fucking nun. Tell her.

24:53.883 --> 24:59.323
You and I, we have business.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.761
Bring it on.

25:01.804 --> 25:03.893
[chuckles]

25:05.765 --> 25:08.898
Oh, my God, I need this.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.987
-Don't leave, Rad-G.
-I'm not going that far.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.946
I found a house two blocks away,

25:12.989 --> 25:16.558
and I expect you
to come over every single day.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.866
-Can I?
-Well, just so you do,

25:19.909 --> 25:22.216
I'm taking my book back.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.219
What's that?

25:25.262 --> 25:26.873
Ugh.
That's the ten commandments.

25:26.916 --> 25:30.137
SHERYL: Really? "Thou shalt
not ever lie to Mom."

25:30.180 --> 25:32.661
"Don't..." uh, wait,
these are all from your mom?

25:32.705 --> 25:34.097
Uh-huh. Want to see what we did?

25:34.141 --> 25:35.403
Sure.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.015
These are ourten commandments.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.017
-You girls?
-Uh-huh.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.889
We decided we needed
some other ones for school,

25:42.932 --> 25:44.151
or else we'll get beat up.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.544
Let's see.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.633
"Don't hit first, but hit back."

25:47.676 --> 25:49.069
-That's Lynn's.
-No, it's good,

25:49.112 --> 25:51.593
it should just be
"hit back harder."

25:51.637 --> 25:54.117
-Wow. Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.032
Yeah. "Sisters before misters,"
love that.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.599
-Love that. Um...
-Mm. Yes.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.820
"If you can't be popular,
be scary."

26:00.863 --> 26:04.214
Oh. I could actually
use these at work.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.826
-What's wrong with work?
-Mm, same as at school.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.262
There's a lot
of bullying going on.

26:08.305 --> 26:11.178
-Yeah, you should.
-Mm-hmm.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.789
-LEXIS: This one's mine.
-"Influence the influencers."

26:13.833 --> 26:15.356
What the heck does that mean?

26:15.399 --> 26:17.010
It's based on Malindaz.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.229
You get popular
and then no one can hurt you.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.449
Hmm.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.625
Who's Malindaz?

26:25.540 --> 26:27.368
So, why me?

26:27.411 --> 26:30.371
Because you're one
of the top influencers.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.460
And I need an influencer.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.508
MALINDAZ:
And what is this?

26:37.552 --> 26:39.119
SHERYL:
It's Makob.

26:39.162 --> 26:42.296
The latest cryptocurrency.

26:42.339 --> 26:45.081
I'm giving you a chance
to get in on the ground floor.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.388
It's the same thing Reese
Witherspoon did with Ethereum,

26:47.431 --> 26:49.912
or Paris Hilton.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.827
And what do I get out of it?

26:51.871 --> 26:54.395
20,000 Makobs.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.702
[laughs]

26:56.745 --> 26:57.920
No.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.880
Look, it's, um...

27:00.923 --> 27:02.925
it's like a stock option.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.058
20,000 Makobs
can mean everything

27:05.101 --> 27:07.582
if you can get the value up.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.281
Have you ever heard
of the Fyre Festival?

27:11.325 --> 27:13.283
-Yeah.
-Well, a lot of influencers

27:13.327 --> 27:16.809
got burned recommending
a festival that was bullshit.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.593
The only thing
that made it worthwhile

27:18.637 --> 27:21.857
is that they were given
$50,000 to $100,000 up front.

27:21.901 --> 27:25.513
You pay me $100,000,
and I'll say whatever you want.

27:30.039 --> 27:34.696
I'll give you $10,000 cash now
and the rest after you say it.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.099
-[music playing]
-[laughter]

27:46.142 --> 27:48.623
This is the place.
Science League.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.539
Yeah, I'm getting
a very high school virgin vibe.

27:51.582 --> 27:54.107
-[gunfire sound effects]
-[shouting]

27:56.805 --> 27:58.111
Why are there
so many dudes here?

27:58.154 --> 27:59.721
Wait, is that why you come here?

27:59.765 --> 28:01.462
Ben, stop it.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.682
Oh, my God, are you
husband-hunting in Nerd Narnia?

28:03.725 --> 28:06.075
-Just give it a chance.
-Okay, all right.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.991
But if one person comes up to me
and says any nerd cliche,

28:09.035 --> 28:10.906
-I am...
-Greetings, Earthlings.

28:12.908 --> 28:15.432
-[explosion]
-Whoa, what was that?

28:15.476 --> 28:17.347
[whooping]

28:17.391 --> 28:19.132
UAC! Put it on the board, sir!

28:19.175 --> 28:22.570
â™ª Need somebody to love...â™ª

28:22.613 --> 28:25.225
NIKITA:
New guys have to pass the test

28:25.268 --> 28:26.748
to get into the Demo Club.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.489
Okay, what's the test?

28:28.532 --> 28:30.491
-You got to blow something up.
-With what?

28:30.534 --> 28:32.362
With whatever you can find
in the kitchen.

28:33.799 --> 28:37.019
You and your sister,
you have three minutes.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.549
Two thirty.

28:59.389 --> 29:00.695
One minute.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.914
Okay, here we go.

29:06.222 --> 29:10.313
â™ª Never gonna set you free...â™ª

29:10.357 --> 29:12.185
[cheering, applause]

29:12.228 --> 29:14.274
Oh, yes!

29:15.623 --> 29:18.495
BELL:
This is the asteroid Bennu.

29:18.539 --> 29:21.672
And this is the NASA spacecraft
OSIRIS-REx.

29:21.716 --> 29:25.154
Now, what is odd
is that NASA has discovered

29:25.198 --> 29:28.462
that Bennu keeps
spitting out rocks.

29:28.505 --> 29:31.552
Some of the rocks
Bennu spits out are hazards.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.380
You were right about this.

29:33.423 --> 29:35.643
I'm always right.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.776
Ha, right. Fine.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.255
Then help me.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.301
Help me solve
all the weird things

29:41.344 --> 29:42.824
that have happened recently.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.565
Sure. But listen to him.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.262
There's an asteroid
that spits out rocks.

29:46.306 --> 29:48.003
And scientists have no idea
why it's happening.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.877
BELL: The orbit of Bennu
is intrinsically...

29:51.920 --> 29:55.358
Yeah, but that's
not like demons.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.884
I agree,

29:58.927 --> 30:01.103
but still, as scientists,
we have to acknowledge

30:01.147 --> 30:03.323
when something
is beyond our knowledge.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.978
Yeah, but that's not the same
as believing in God.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.762
Allah?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.068
Sure, Allah.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.070
I don't believe in Allah.
It's just true.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.898
You don't believe
in something that's true,

30:12.941 --> 30:14.464
like the room
you're standing in.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.379
Okay, please,
don't get all Socratic on me.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.947
You don't believe
that it's real, it just is.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.906
Because I can see it.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.821
Well, who's to say
that's not a deepfake?

30:24.648 --> 30:26.999
[chuckles]
Okay. Okay, Karima,

30:27.042 --> 30:28.652
please don't try to get me
to believe in God.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.829
Okay? Just help me.

30:33.353 --> 30:37.009
Sure. I'll drop by.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.620
Good.

30:39.663 --> 30:42.666
...who entered
a Name that Asteroid contest,

30:42.710 --> 30:44.930
uh, run by
the University of Arizona.

30:44.973 --> 30:48.542
So, roughly 100 million miles
from the Sun...

30:48.585 --> 30:50.326
So the first color
you should work with

30:50.370 --> 30:53.155
from your eyeshadow palette
is caramel blush.

30:53.199 --> 30:57.203
And mix it with, like,
a little bit of light latte.

30:57.246 --> 30:58.900
And while you do that,
I want to talk about

30:58.944 --> 31:02.512
a cool new investment
you should look at.

31:02.556 --> 31:05.254
-Makob.
-[cheering sound effect]

31:05.298 --> 31:07.561
Bitcoin is for billionaires,

31:07.604 --> 31:10.042
not working girls like us.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.218
You want to get in
on the ground floor

31:12.261 --> 31:15.482
of a cryptocurrency,
and trust me,

31:15.525 --> 31:17.397
-it's Makob.
-Rad-G.

[demon snarling]

31:27.146 --> 31:29.191
[demon exhales]

31:32.151 --> 31:36.851
You know who I fantasized
about last night?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.331
You.

31:38.374 --> 31:41.812
You were so hot.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.206
[door opens]

31:44.250 --> 31:46.295
-Hey, Sister.
-ANDREA: Leo.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.601
Amalia.

31:51.648 --> 31:54.260
-It's not going well.
-What's not?

31:54.303 --> 31:57.350
Your counseling. The demon's
larger. It's in control.

31:57.393 --> 32:00.570
Sister, I...
I need to do what I do.

32:00.614 --> 32:04.052
I know, but do it better.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.272
So, how did it go?

32:06.315 --> 32:08.361
-Good...
-Yeah?

32:08.404 --> 32:09.753
...I think.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.364
Yes, uh...

32:11.407 --> 32:13.975
we did everything
just as you said.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.890
[Andrea clears throat]

32:17.370 --> 32:22.027
So no more, um, hives or nausea?

32:22.070 --> 32:24.768
Uh... no.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.775
KRISTEN:
Okay, let me break this down.

32:31.819 --> 32:34.822
The amount of time that you guys
spent intentionally avoiding

32:34.865 --> 32:38.130
physical intimacy
has conditioned your bodies

32:38.173 --> 32:42.134
to illicit
this negative response.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.092
Did you try the role-playing?

32:44.136 --> 32:47.008
Yeah, but, um...

32:47.052 --> 32:49.445
-[snorts] It was...
-[blows raspberry]

32:49.489 --> 32:51.360
Awkward. Just really weird.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.101
Oh, weird's good.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.756
I'd love to try one more thing,
if you're open to it.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.932
I'd like to split you two up.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.854
[demon snarls]

33:10.858 --> 33:13.339
If you wanted to be
alone with me,

33:13.382 --> 33:15.645
all you had to do was ask.

33:15.689 --> 33:18.039
ANDREA:
Don't flatter yourself.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.780
What do you want?

33:19.823 --> 33:24.132
I could never resist
a nun's sexy ankles.

33:26.134 --> 33:29.964
You know you're losing.
So just lose.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.142
-[door opens]
-Mr. Townsend.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.841
What is the issue today?

33:37.885 --> 33:40.496
Sister Andrea.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.716
And her health issues.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.067
Amalia.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.333
Our imagination
is a really important tool

33:51.377 --> 33:53.770
in figuring out
what we want in bed.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.903
AMALIA:
I've never thought

33:55.946 --> 33:58.210
-about another man in my life.
-KRISTEN: I know.

33:58.253 --> 33:59.907
I know, I know.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.953
But sex is something
you don't want to domesticate.

34:02.997 --> 34:05.260
You want it to run wild.

34:05.304 --> 34:06.957
-[sighs]
-That's why I split you two up.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.350
I want you
to surprise each other.

34:08.394 --> 34:10.570
I want you to stop thinking
about God.

34:10.613 --> 34:13.051
I want you to do what your body

34:13.094 --> 34:14.878
wants you to do.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.447
Leo, do you have a minute?

34:18.491 --> 34:19.927
Sure.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.716
MALINDAZ:
Congratulations, influencees.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.979
Not only do you look great--
and I love that shade

34:29.023 --> 34:32.896
of lipstick, by the way--
but you're rich!

34:32.940 --> 34:34.811
If you got in
on the ground floor with Makob,

34:34.855 --> 34:38.163
it has gone from ten dollars

34:38.206 --> 34:40.382
to $27!

34:40.426 --> 34:41.905
-That's right.
-Oh, my God.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.865
If you invested just, like, $500

34:44.908 --> 34:47.650
with Makob-- and if you didn't,
I feel sorry for you--

34:47.694 --> 34:50.566
you are now worth...

34:50.610 --> 34:52.742
$10,000!

Yes! Yahoo!

[whoops]

34:57.921 --> 34:59.575
Oh, yeah!
[whoops]

34:59.619 --> 35:01.142
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.883
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
-Are you okay?

35:02.926 --> 35:05.015
Taylor. How are you?
[chuckles]

35:05.059 --> 35:07.453
-I'm good, ma'am. How are you?
-Good.

35:07.496 --> 35:09.107
Did you get
the chocolates I sent you?

35:09.150 --> 35:10.412
I did. They're very good.

35:10.456 --> 35:12.458
Congratulations, by the way.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.720
Thank you. Bobby!

35:13.763 --> 35:15.809
Get in here. Now.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.246
-[indistinct chatter]
-Move it.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.421
Close the door.

35:21.858 --> 35:24.078
Taylor, um, it's a new day,

35:24.122 --> 35:27.255
and your services
will no longer be needed here.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.562
Okay. Well, I'm not resigning,

35:29.605 --> 35:31.781
-and you can't fire me.
-SHERYL: That's true.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.609
Leland did put you
at that desk to spy on me,

35:33.653 --> 35:35.045
but here's the thing--

35:35.089 --> 35:36.612
and, Bobby, I want you

35:36.656 --> 35:38.005
to pay close attention.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.660
I checked
your entrance interview,

35:40.703 --> 35:42.923
and you're allergic
to Brazil nuts.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.794
And you know what?

35:44.838 --> 35:47.406
There was some
in that chocolate I gave you.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.846
No. No, no, no, no.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.240
I-I, uh, I took it.
Your epinephrine.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.201
-No, no. No, no, no.
-[Taylor panting]

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
Here is a resignation letter,

36:02.247 --> 36:03.465
-Taylor.
-[Taylor grunts, panting]

36:03.509 --> 36:05.685
Before your little throat
swells up

36:05.728 --> 36:07.208
and you choke on your own vomit,

36:07.252 --> 36:09.123
-I would sign it.
-[Taylor clears throat]

36:09.167 --> 36:11.734
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sign it.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.563
[Taylor breathing heavily]

36:14.607 --> 36:16.391
-SHERYL: Good girl.
-[Taylor clears throat]

36:17.392 --> 36:18.959
No. No, no, no. I insist

36:19.002 --> 36:20.134
on seeing you out.
Let's go, let's go.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.135
-Shoo.
-[elevator bell chimes]

36:21.179 --> 36:22.441
[Taylor gasping]

36:22.484 --> 36:23.877
Thank you for your service.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.661
Your security card
will be deactivated,

36:25.705 --> 36:27.185
and your belongings
will be mailed

36:27.228 --> 36:29.230
to your home address.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.666
Oh,

36:30.710 --> 36:32.842
I know. It must be so hard.

36:32.886 --> 36:36.150
I get emotional, too.
Just try not to panic.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.153
[Taylor whimpers]

36:42.156 --> 36:44.637
Everyone has their weaknesses,
Bobby.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.726
Don't make me find yours.

36:46.769 --> 36:47.944
Yes, ma'am.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.250
Now get back to work.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.994
Faster, you fucking millennial.

all the nonsense you're getting
from your religious coworkers,

39:31.847 --> 39:32.935
I'm gonna solve with you.

The two of us.

And anything we can't solve,

Hey.

Did you do something
to yourself?

You seem to have a lot more...

something.

Oh.

Boom!

-"Boom"?
-BEN: Yeah.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.199
Boom.

Come on.

there's no toxicity.

Leave us alone, Sister.

-[door opens]

41:02.460 --> 41:04.505
You asked to see me, Monsignor?

41:04.549 --> 41:05.941
Yes, Sister.

41:09.945 --> 41:12.557
I expect you'd like me
to shut the door.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.036
Please.

41:17.387 --> 41:18.824
If you would...

41:21.217 --> 41:23.437
Have you been
feeling all right lately?

41:23.481 --> 41:25.744
I've been feeling
like I always have.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.615
Perfectly fine.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.922
Has the Mother Superior
said something

41:29.965 --> 41:31.706
-about my work?
-KORECKI: No.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.665
But you've been observed lately

41:33.708 --> 41:37.582
acting in a manner
that may suggest ill health.

41:37.625 --> 41:38.626
Really?

41:38.670 --> 41:40.193
In what way?

41:42.195 --> 41:46.852
I don't mean any disrespect,
Sister, but I have noticed

41:46.895 --> 41:49.289
an unsteadiness of gait.

41:49.332 --> 41:51.073
[chuckles]:
And of hand.

41:51.117 --> 41:53.380
That time when you were serving
the monsignor and myself

41:53.423 --> 41:56.209
and you accidentally
poured tea in my lap.

41:56.252 --> 41:58.124
There is

41:58.167 --> 42:00.605
an accelerating forgetfulness.

42:00.648 --> 42:04.783
Understandable
as time takes its toll.

42:04.826 --> 42:07.960
What is most concerning of all,

42:08.003 --> 42:11.964
others, like me, have witnessed
an unsettling tendency

42:12.007 --> 42:14.140
toward hallucination.

42:14.183 --> 42:15.141
What others?

42:15.184 --> 42:18.057
It is only out of concern

42:18.100 --> 42:21.626
that we feel compelled
to point out what we have seen.

42:21.669 --> 42:23.410
KORECKI:
Thank you, Sister.

42:23.453 --> 42:25.151
-You may return to your duties.
-ANDREA: I'm not to be

42:25.194 --> 42:26.892
-permitted to defend myself?
-KORECKI: There's no need

42:26.935 --> 42:28.284
to defend yourself, Sister.

42:28.328 --> 42:30.156
We are all part
of God's community.

42:30.199 --> 42:32.811
-[knock on door]
-You're excused.

42:41.254 --> 42:43.604
I think it's better if I stay.

42:43.648 --> 42:45.693
No. But thank you.

42:51.612 --> 42:53.527
KORECKI: David, do you mind
closing the door?

42:53.571 --> 42:56.182
And, Leland,
do you mind stepping out, too?

42:56.225 --> 42:57.705
Are you sure?

42:57.749 --> 43:00.229
Yes. I just need a moment.

43:07.976 --> 43:10.413
I'll make this brief.
There have been reports

43:10.457 --> 43:12.938
that Sister Andrea
is in declining health.

43:12.981 --> 43:15.157
DAVID:
Declining? How?

43:15.201 --> 43:18.552
KORECKI: Some physical
but also cognitive.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.989
The worry is...

43:21.033 --> 43:22.469
liability.

43:22.512 --> 43:24.253
DAVID:
I work closely with the sister.

43:24.297 --> 43:26.386
KORECKI: No, David,
I don't need to hear from you.

43:26.429 --> 43:29.215
I know you two are friends.
In fact,

43:29.258 --> 43:31.304
do you mind stepping out, too?

43:33.306 --> 43:35.047
Are you sure, Monsignor?

43:35.090 --> 43:36.918
Yes, David. Please.

43:44.099 --> 43:47.494
In terms of any mental issues,
Ms. Bouchard,

43:47.537 --> 43:49.539
I'm anxious to hear
what you've observed.

43:49.583 --> 43:51.541
I'm hearing that Sister Andrea

43:51.585 --> 43:54.501
is talking to imaginary figures.

43:54.544 --> 43:55.807
Is that true?

44:00.202 --> 44:01.987
No, not at all.

44:02.030 --> 44:03.641
She's been good.

44:07.514 --> 44:10.125
[door opens, closes]

44:18.090 --> 44:20.570
Thank you for your help, Sister.

44:23.095 --> 44:24.836
You're welcome,

44:24.879 --> 44:26.315
Doctor.
