-cannot fit on this couch.
-Okay.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.706
Remember when I told you
I was gonna treat you like

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
-more mature girls?
-Uh-huh.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.231
So that's what
we're dealing with right now.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.493
What's this about?

11:08.537 --> 11:09.843
That's from your closet.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.540
-I didn't take it.
-Why was Lexis wearing it

11:11.583 --> 11:13.498
-while chanting?
-What did you say to her?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.979
No, this is not about Lexis,
this is about us as a family.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.807
Okay? Lynn, you're the oldest.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.243
You're supposed to be
setting an example.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.376
Why are you punishing Lexis?

11:21.419 --> 11:22.986
-I'm not punishing her. Hold on.
-Yes, you are.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.902
You told us, Mom,
to support each other.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.730
Family is more important
than anything.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.471
-Yeah, you said that...
-And what Lexis did

11:29.514 --> 11:31.691
hurt one of us. Me.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.562
No, Lexis told the truth.
She made you tell the truth.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.825
But she did it because
she wanted to hurt me.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.609
I'm feeling a little
attacked here...

11:37.653 --> 11:39.829
[overlapping chatter]

11:41.526 --> 11:43.528
Okay, quiet!

11:43.572 --> 11:44.791
This is what we're gonna do.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.923
Everybody be quiet until I talk.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.362
-What's she gonna do, hit us?
-LAURA: It's not even my fault.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.495
-Like, Lexis told.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.888
-Yeah, it's Lexis's fault.
-Guys, can we just please

11:54.931 --> 11:56.498
be quiet?
I don't want to hear this.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.587
-You said, you said...
-Shut up!

11:58.630 --> 12:01.068
-Quiet!
-...her fault!

12:02.112 --> 12:04.462
I'm creating a Ten Commandments
for this family.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.855
-What?
-Ten rules

12:05.899 --> 12:08.162
that must be followed,
no matter what.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.251
But the nuns say we have
ten commandments already.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.556
Yeah, but my girls
aren't following them.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.863
So this is the first one.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.126
Thou shalt

12:16.170 --> 12:18.694
not ever

12:18.738 --> 12:22.872
lie to Mom.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.311
Do we all understand that?

12:27.355 --> 12:29.574
-Yes.
-Yes. What?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.533
Is it all right to lie
to other people?

12:31.576 --> 12:32.882
No.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.842
What if we have Jews
in our basement?

12:35.885 --> 12:36.843
-Oh, my God.
-Or Trump with immigrants.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.801
-Yeah.
-Okay, look,

12:38.845 --> 12:40.194
as real as these examples are,
we're just gonna

12:40.237 --> 12:41.804
have to figure it out as we go.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.502
Okay? But what's most important?

12:44.546 --> 12:47.288
ALL: "Thou shalt not
ever lie to Mom."

12:47.331 --> 12:49.856
Very good.
All right, number two.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.472
ALL:
"If Leland approaches you,

12:57.515 --> 12:59.517
-tell Mom."
-Beautiful.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.997
Number three.

13:06.829 --> 13:10.093
ALL: "Do not go
into Mom's closet."

13:10.137 --> 13:11.834
There are a lot
of commandments about you.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.662
Yeah, because until you're 18
and I kick you all out,

13:13.705 --> 13:15.882
I'm the most important
person here. Okay?

13:15.925 --> 13:17.666
[pipes rumbling]

13:17.709 --> 13:19.320
Uh, Mom, I think
Ben needs our help.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.975
Hey, stay.
Which leads us to number four.

13:22.018 --> 13:25.239
"Do not interrupt Mom."

NARRATOR: While dollar bills
are traded through a bank,

16:01.569 --> 16:03.310
Makob is traded peer to peer.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.702
Once you have Makobs,
what can you do with them?

16:04.746 --> 16:06.530
Spend them.
More and more retailers

16:06.574 --> 16:09.055
are accepting Makob
as a method of payment.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.621
You can purchase anything

In a global economy,
Makob is the new frontier.

-Makob? What is that?
-LELAND: It's a coin.

It's real. It's solid.

And it's trading
for $11.30 per coin.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.038
That trades for eleven dollars?

is to get Makob

16:46.570 --> 16:49.921
to trade for $135 per coin.

16:50.966 --> 16:51.923
Wait.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.926
$135 for what?

16:54.970 --> 16:56.145

You have a team of 30 employees,

Because you're worrying me.

Look at yourself.
You look depressed.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.242
I am not depressed.

I was diagnosed
as culturally derealized

20:07.206 --> 20:09.251
-Culturally...
-Derealized.

20:09.295 --> 20:13.603
It means disgusted
with the insanity of reality.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.390
-What insanity?
-Um, the cases

20:17.433 --> 20:21.437
that I have been trying to solve
that don't make any sense.

20:21.481 --> 20:24.527

a soul-weighing machine,

20:24.571 --> 20:27.487

with a twin attached?

I try to figure out these cases
that don't make any sense.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.844
And then we just move on
to the next thing.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.802
Okay.

20:38.846 --> 20:43.154
Ben, sit down.

I was sitting down.

-Listen to me.

together before your wedding?

how Leo initiates sex?

is-is very sensitive.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.931
Yes, and it seems
to be going well.

Yes, but only if the subjects
feel completely open.

Yeah.

I'm not here to undercut
your therapy, ma'am,

23:00.640 --> 23:02.468
but there's a spiritual
component here that...

23:02.511 --> 23:04.513
And I would agree,
but the spiritual

23:04.557 --> 23:06.602
needs to come
after the pragmatic.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.038
I hadn't finished.

23:09.779 --> 23:14.001
There's a spiritual, and even
supernatural component here.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.003
That is how I can help you.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.310
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.312
