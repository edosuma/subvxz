Hey, where'd you get that?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.799
Don't worry about it.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.801
There's a couple pistols
under there, too.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.542
Give one to Curtis!

00:20.585 --> 00:22.109
We don't need
to be shooting at cops.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.241
You got us into this,
and I'm gonna get us out.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.503
Take a left up here.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.889
Well, you came
to the right spot,

Come on, get up!Man, what are you doing?

03:21.897 --> 03:23.855
If the cops can't see us,
they can't shoot us.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.335
Yeah, but we can't
see them, either.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.510
What if they
try something?

03:26.554 --> 03:27.685
One of these innocent bystanders

03:27.729 --> 03:30.384

down, man.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.082

03:33.125 --> 03:34.649

not holed up in this place!

03:34.692 --> 03:36.433
Come on,
just do what Boomer says.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.087
Watch the names!

03:38.130 --> 03:40.263
Three of them, two of us--
I don't mind those odds.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.265
You're forgetting about the
other 20 people in here.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.571
PRIDE:
Any one of them could get caught

03:43.614 --> 03:46.095
in the crossfire.Not if we move fast.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.706
Hey, sweetheart,
get your ass over here. Now.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.148
We need officers covering
every entrance.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.803
And get those pedestrians
out of here now!

03:59.804 --> 04:01.850
Hey. Hey, hey.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.418
What's your name?

04:04.461 --> 04:06.071
Leroi.
Special Operations Division.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.769
I'm Captain Estes.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.423
ESTES:
You got a sitrep?

04:09.466 --> 04:11.120
Detective Derek Franklin
was found dead of a GSW

04:11.163 --> 04:12.600
to the head in the Lower Ninth.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.906
Responding officers witnessed
suspects Curtis Isaacs

04:14.950 --> 04:17.039
and two accomplices
fleeing the scene.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.650
How did SOD
get here so fast?

04:19.694 --> 04:21.478
Franklin was my partner.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.088
I'm sorry.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.655
All right,
we're gonna get these guys.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.309
Where are they at now?

04:26.353 --> 04:29.181
They fled into the establishment
across the street.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.055
Holy crap.

04:33.098 --> 04:36.450
That's Dwayne Pride's bar.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.626
We got to figure out
the play here.This ismy play.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.802
But by all means,
if you don't like it,
there's the door.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.064
Screw you!Get over here

04:42.107 --> 04:43.152
and say that to my face!

04:43.195 --> 04:44.936
Excuse me, guys.
Hey, uh, guys...

04:44.980 --> 04:46.938
can we talk?

04:46.982 --> 04:48.462
BOOMER:
I think I made it clear.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.420
You're supposed
to keep your mouth shut!

04:50.464 --> 04:52.857
PRIDE:
Okay. Just hang on.

04:52.901 --> 04:56.034
This is my bar, these
are my customers,

04:56.078 --> 04:58.689
and I just want
to keep them all safe.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.343
Then try taking directions.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.040
You're Boomer, right?

05:03.520 --> 05:05.348
They call me...

05:05.392 --> 05:08.569
D-Man.

05:08.612 --> 05:09.744
There's a door in the kitchen.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.180
Police could sneak through.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.138
With your permission, I
could go and barricade it.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.575
Why would you do that?

05:14.618 --> 05:17.273
Because I want to make sure

05:17.317 --> 05:19.580
we all get out of here alive.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.628
Your man could go with me.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.238
We can do it fast.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.242
If he tries
anything funny,

05:30.286 --> 05:32.027
put a bullet
in his brain.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.681
Come on.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.079
SEBASTIAN:
Boom.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.211
All done with my pile.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.560
Already?Oh, yeah.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.519
I'm on a roll, baby.
Got any filing left to do?

05:45.562 --> 05:47.172
Or paperwork?
Or I could clean your desk.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.479
Let's move your desk!Sebastian.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.611
How many cups of coffee
have you had?

05:50.654 --> 05:52.003
Including this one?Yeah.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.701
Five. No. Six.
Oh.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.311
Seven. Actually, it was seven.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.878
Why
Yeah.

05:56.921 --> 05:59.315
I'm gonna need you to dial it
back, like, ten, okay?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.535
Okay. Sorry. Just, my whole
Saturday routine's all off.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.451
You know, usually we come in,
catch up on some paperwork,

06:04.494 --> 06:07.541
there's a box of Blue Dot
donuts in there...Sonja usually brought them.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.064
Really? I always thought
that was Pride.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.719
No. But she did leave us
something to remember her by.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.156
Yeah, her
backlogged paperwork.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.723
LASALLE:
Sebastian. Gregorio.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.333
GREGORIO:
What's wrong?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.726
We got a problem.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.075
There's a hostage situation

06:20.118 --> 06:21.468
going on right now
at the Trutone.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.992
Pride's inside.
Let's roll.
Go!

06:24.035 --> 06:26.124
[sirens wailing,
helicopter blades whirring]

06:31.956 --> 06:32.870
Don't move.
PRIDE:
You said you came here

06:32.914 --> 06:34.176
looking for me.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.786
Well, here I am.
What's this about?

06:35.830 --> 06:37.788
I'm in trouble
and I need your help.

06:37.832 --> 06:41.575
Cops out there think I killed
a detective. Derek Franklin.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.316
I'm innocent.Innocent men don't lead the
police on high-speed chases

06:44.360 --> 06:46.101
and take a bar
full of hostages.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.364
What was I supposed to do?Turn yourself in.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.497
Get justice
the rightway.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.586
But they think I murdered
one of their own.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.023
Hell, I won't make it
to see justice.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.590
I won't make it to booking.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.766
Why are they so sure
that you're the killer?

06:58.809 --> 07:00.420
Because they found
Franklin's body

07:00.463 --> 07:03.423
in my apartment just
as I was running away.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.815
You know, I-I was a CI.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.122
I was feeding him
information about my crew.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.863
He was supposed
to get me out of the life.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.604
Man, I like the guy.
I wouldn't hurt him.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.041
Then how did his dead body
end up in your apartment?

07:13.084 --> 07:14.912
All right, he texted me,
told me to meet him.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.610
Said he needed to talk.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.220
When I got there,
he was dead.

07:18.263 --> 07:21.702
And the cops were already on
their way. Man, I was set up.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.138
What do your buddies know?

07:23.181 --> 07:24.531
Boomer and Red know nothing.

07:24.574 --> 07:25.836
They were waiting for me
outside my place

07:25.880 --> 07:27.142
when I came running out.

07:27.185 --> 07:31.102
And if they knew I was
a CI, they'd kill me.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.235
Of all the people

07:33.278 --> 07:35.237
in the city of New Orleans,
why come to me?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.674
CURTIS:
Man, you're Dwayne Pride.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.719
I read about you
in the paper.

07:38.762 --> 07:41.678
You stand up
when no one else will.

07:41.722 --> 07:44.464
I need you to stand up for me.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.162
I need a phone.No way.

07:47.205 --> 07:50.121
What exactly do you think
I can do for you in here

07:50.165 --> 07:51.688
without contacting
the outside world?

07:51.732 --> 07:53.516
Get me a phone.Okay, all right.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.518
If I do, you'll
help clear me?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.564
One step at a time--
you give me a phone,

07:57.607 --> 08:00.523
I'll reach out and see what
I can learn from my people.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.786
One more thing.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.833
Boomer and Red...

08:05.876 --> 08:08.618
if they touch one hair on any
of these people out there...

08:10.664 --> 08:13.536
...I'm gonna hold you
responsible, you understand?

08:13.580 --> 08:14.755
Yes.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.851
LASALLE:
Estes. What do you know?

08:23.894 --> 08:26.027
Well, we got
three gunman inside,

08:26.070 --> 08:29.857
and we estimate about
20 hostages, including Pride.Is he okay?

08:29.900 --> 08:32.424
Don't know who's okay or not--
haven't made contact yet.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.384
This is Detective Leroi, SOD.GREGORIO:
You have background

08:35.427 --> 08:36.559
on the suspects?
Yeah.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.821
Curtis Isaacs,

08:37.865 --> 08:39.519
low-level CI,
and two associates

08:39.562 --> 08:42.609
we believe to be
Boomer Gilles and Red Jacobs.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.088
They run with
the C-Town Crew.

08:44.132 --> 08:45.655
Pull burglaries,
shakedowns, stick-ups.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.831
Street hoodlums until
about an hour ago

08:47.875 --> 08:49.441
when Curtis murdered
his handler.

08:49.485 --> 08:50.660
My partner.

08:50.704 --> 08:51.879
In cold blood.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.881
Detective
Franklin.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.579
ESTES:
We got an anonymous tip

08:56.623 --> 08:58.625
about an officer down on 911

08:58.668 --> 09:00.235
right after the shooting.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.542
Units arrived
and found Isaacs and the others

09:02.585 --> 09:04.108
fleeing the scene,

09:04.152 --> 09:05.762
and they led the pursuing
officers right to here.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.547
Led them? You mean,
like, on purpose?

09:07.590 --> 09:09.679
Curtis drove right up
to the Trutone door.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.942
So we're setting up a command
center in here, trying to get

09:11.986 --> 09:13.683
a phone line into the bar.All right, NCIS

09:13.727 --> 09:15.946
will take point,
try to contact Pride

09:15.990 --> 09:17.600
and get those
people out safe.No way.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.733
Whoa. An NCIS agent
is being held at gunpoint.

09:19.776 --> 09:20.995
Gives us jurisdiction.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.300
Your man's being held

09:22.344 --> 09:24.041
because an SOD detective
was murdered.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.956
So you guys are gonna have
to take a step back.And who are you?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.610
Captain Davis,
Special Operations.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.438
Since SOD handles
all hostage situations,

09:29.481 --> 09:30.918
this is our circus.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.223
Well, Pride's
probably already working

09:32.267 --> 09:33.834
some kind of angle.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.923
He's our best chance
of ending this peacefully.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.620
In my experience,
a seasoned negotiator

09:37.664 --> 09:39.796
and a TAC team are the only ways
to end a standoff.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.929
But NCIS is welcome
to stick around and observe

09:41.972 --> 09:43.234
as my guests.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.022
Let's talk, Carl.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.940
No way in hell we're
standing down, right?

09:52.983 --> 09:55.203
Not with Pride in danger.Yeah, of course not.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.900
But we got to be careful.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.946
Captain Davis is right--

09:58.989 --> 09:59.816
we don't have jurisdiction.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.470
Am I the only one who thinks

10:01.513 --> 10:02.950
that something seems off?

10:02.993 --> 10:04.865
I mean, Curtis kills
his handler,

10:04.908 --> 10:06.954
then 911 gets tipped
immediately?

10:06.997 --> 10:08.129
This feels funny.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.652
Maybe there was a witness?

10:09.696 --> 10:10.827
Yeah, but then why did Curtis

10:10.871 --> 10:12.437
lead the cops
directly to Pride's bar?

10:12.481 --> 10:15.789
You think, uh, he went
there for a reason?

10:15.832 --> 10:17.399
Maybe we should try
to figure out why.

10:17.442 --> 10:21.229
All right. Sebastian, head
to Franklin's crime scene.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.447
See what you can figure out.

10:22.491 --> 10:23.448
All right, I'm gonna
stick around here.

10:23.492 --> 10:24.449
Gregorio,
head back to NCIS...

10:24.493 --> 10:26.364
Whoa, you want me to leave?

10:26.408 --> 10:27.496
Well, I need you to dig up

10:27.539 --> 10:28.976
everything you can
on the suspects

10:29.019 --> 10:30.194
andDetective Franklin.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.761
Any detail you find

10:31.805 --> 10:32.849
will help us help Pride.

10:32.893 --> 10:33.937
All right.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.243
Hey.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.592
We got a line open.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.289
We're about to contact
the suspects.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.682
Lasalle.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.904
Keep Pride safe, all right?

10:49.431 --> 10:50.780
Come on.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.826
What the hell is that?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.523
We took all the phones.I have a landline.

10:54.566 --> 10:55.611
Stay where you are.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.656
Curtis,

10:56.699 --> 10:57.700
pull out the phone.

11:03.619 --> 11:04.751
What do we do?

11:06.013 --> 11:07.971
Answer it.He is talking to me.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.540
No one's been hurt here.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.848
You got a chance to walk away.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.594
Talk to them.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.955
Damn, man, what are you doing?Screw them!

11:34.998 --> 11:36.217
Boomer, let's just talk.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.530
You want to be
the first to die, girl?No, no, no.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.272
Don't.Fine, then, it'll be you.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.275
Say good-bye, D-Man.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.426
You gonna shoot me, Boomer?

12:11.469 --> 12:13.820
There a reason I shouldn't?

12:13.863 --> 12:17.388
Cops hear gunfire,
they storm the building.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.651
Everyone gets shot.

12:19.695 --> 12:22.785
But if you listen to me,
I can help you get out of this.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.787
Bar owners train
in standoffs?

12:24.831 --> 12:27.050
Just speaking common sense.

12:30.010 --> 12:30.967
You're gonna want to answer.

12:31.011 --> 12:31.968
I got open warrants

12:32.012 --> 12:33.448
and two strikes.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.710
What are we gonna talk about?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.668
An exit strategy.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.714
Cops are calling
to start a conversation.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.978
Your best bet of survival
is talking to them.

12:46.113 --> 12:49.029
Red, tie the spitfire up.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.422
Kick her in the teeth if
she makes another move.

13:00.431 --> 13:01.781
What?

13:01.824 --> 13:02.956
What do you want?

13:02.999 --> 13:05.088
This is Captain
Steven Davis, NOPD.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.089
Who am I talking to?

13:06.133 --> 13:07.221
Don't worry about it.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.135
Just get the hell
out of the street

13:08.178 --> 13:09.136
and we'll be on our way.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.702
That's Boomer.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.488
He's the leader of the crew.

13:13.531 --> 13:14.489
Boomer.

13:14.532 --> 13:15.490
We're not leaving

13:15.533 --> 13:16.491
till all the hostages are safe.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.753
Now, is anyone hurt?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.408
They're in the pink of health.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.150
Good. Let's keep it that way,
and talk about what you want.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.892
What I want is a way out.
Because I've got news for you.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.894
If I don't get
out of here alive,

13:27.937 --> 13:30.853
I promise I'm not gonna the
only one who's gonna die today.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.942
Gonna have to get a little
more specific, there, Boomer.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.902
Hold on. All right.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.904
I don't think we got a chance
but to try and make a deal.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.514
That was incredibly
stupid of you.

13:39.557 --> 13:42.430
Yeah, well, someone
had to take action.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.432
Deal's a deal.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.613
PRIDE: You broke
the deal already.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.354
I said if no one gets hurt.

13:53.397 --> 13:54.529
She started that crap.

13:54.572 --> 13:55.617
Yeah, I get it.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.880
I messed up. Moving on.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.664
BOOMER: Okay, we want
a helicopter,

13:59.708 --> 14:01.101
and a pilot to get us
out of here, to Mexico--

14:01.144 --> 14:03.103
no, w-wait, to Cuba.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.626
Couple hiccups with that plan,
there, Boomer.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.975
Can't land a helicopter
in the Marigny.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.411
The street's too narrow.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.413
Plus, a helo won't
get you to Cuba.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.850
PRIDE: I have no reason
to believe that you didn't

14:10.893 --> 14:12.982
kill Detective Franklin.True.

14:13.026 --> 14:16.681
But if I'm right, a cop killer's
out there, running free.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.988
[indistinct conversation
continues in background]

14:20.947 --> 14:24.298
...then get us to the airport
and find us a damn plane!

14:24.341 --> 14:25.690
Okay, we can work on
that, but you're gonna

14:25.734 --> 14:26.822
have to release some hostages.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.868
BOOMER:
No way. They're the only ones

14:28.911 --> 14:30.913
keeping us breathing right now.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.306
Which means there's no way
I'm letting anyone go

14:32.349 --> 14:34.569
until I know
what the hell you're offering.

14:34.612 --> 14:37.789
You get something,
we get something.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.356
It's good faith.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.923
Come on, Boomer,
let's work together.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.925
The good faith is no one's dead.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.014
Yet.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.451
BOOMER: So if you
want everybody

14:47.495 --> 14:48.539
to come out
of here safe,

14:48.583 --> 14:50.454
then you better
figure it out.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.934
Get us a plane!

14:58.419 --> 14:59.637
Now what?

14:59.681 --> 15:01.204
Now we wait.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.947
Lakefront Airport makes
the most sense for a plane.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.993
You know, it's small enough
to be contained.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.429
I'll make some calls.

15:08.472 --> 15:09.865
Gives time
for my TAC team to access

15:09.909 --> 15:11.475
the empty apartment
on the second floor.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.261
Drop a camera, put eyes inside,
get ready to breach.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.480
Detective Leroi's part of TAC?

15:16.524 --> 15:17.873
His partner was killed.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.483
We all got skin
in the game here.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.007
Yeah, but the whole point
is to de-escalate.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.399
Yeah, that's the hope,
but if these guys

15:22.443 --> 15:24.271
won't negotiate,
then we go with plan "B."

15:24.314 --> 15:27.448
Pride's in there working on his
own plan to keep everyone safe.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.624
All right? Going in guns blazing
won't help.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.060
I know Pride and his reputation,

15:31.104 --> 15:32.627
but right now he's a prisoner,
and I seem to be

15:32.670 --> 15:33.933
the only one
trying to get him out.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.630
Yeah. In a body bag.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.806
Hey, Lasalle. Calm down.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.417
You are here to observe,
not obstruct.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.245
Look, not trying to
obstruct, Captain.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.073
All right, just playing
the long game.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.901
Keep the negotiations going.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.034
All right, show them
your good faith.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.819
Let me make contact with Pride.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.038
Okay.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.083
How are you going to do that?

15:56.868 --> 15:59.175
Don't have much of a plan,
do you?

16:00.394 --> 16:02.004
You know, Steven,

16:02.048 --> 16:04.050
I've seen NCIS
do more with less.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.400
I mean, no harm in
letting it play out, huh?

16:06.443 --> 16:08.619
I mean, at least as long
as your men are setting up.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.361
Okay.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.668
Stay out of our way.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.022
Hey, thanks, Estes.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.763
Oh, don't thank me yet.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.548
This whole situation
just got a lot more complicated.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.333
REPORTER:
Yeah, we rolling?

16:26.376 --> 16:27.595
Yes, sir.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.075
Breaking news
from the Marigny

16:29.118 --> 16:32.034
as a hostage situation plays out
live on the corner...

16:32.078 --> 16:33.949
Hey. You see this?

16:33.993 --> 16:37.039
Media's only gonna make
the standoff worse.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.042
Oh, Lasalle'll keep the
pot from boiling over.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.522
I hope. He's outnumbered

16:41.565 --> 16:43.045
by a bunch of cops
who want payback.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.526
Damn, this is a bad time
to be down one agent.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.006
Wish Sonja was here
to cover our back.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.355
Yeah, well, it's not up to us.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.009
Pride's still out there
in trouble,

16:50.052 --> 16:51.662
and I'm sitting in here
drowning in suspect files.

16:51.706 --> 16:52.663
Learn anything?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.404
Boomer Gilles is no joke.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.538
Served time for aggravated
assault and weapons possession.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.888
Got an open warrant
for armed robbery

16:59.931 --> 17:01.324
where he shot a store clerk.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.631
What about the other two?Red isn't any better.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.676
Served time for
guns and drugs.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.287
But Curtis...

17:07.330 --> 17:09.071
simple burglary.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.420
Nothing violent.
I mean, he doesn't seem

17:10.464 --> 17:12.466
like a cop killer.I don't know that he is.

17:12.509 --> 17:15.034
I got access
to Detective Franklin's cell.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.122
Pulled the texts
between him and Curtis.

17:16.165 --> 17:19.081
"Derek: Car broke. Need ride.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.953
"Curtis: Where you?
Derek: Same place as before.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.043
"Curtis: Near bridge?

17:24.086 --> 17:27.263
Derek: Other side. Ten minutes."Read like code, right?

17:27.307 --> 17:29.700
Makes sense when a CI
communicates with his handler.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.702
Look at the last text
Curtis sent.

17:31.746 --> 17:34.096
"Info on the Riley Situation.
Meet me at your place now."

17:34.140 --> 17:37.447
I mean, he drops the
code completely.Either he got lazy,

17:37.491 --> 17:39.101
or Franklin
didn't send that text.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
Someone got their hands
on his phone

17:41.147 --> 17:43.105
to try to draw Curtis
back to his apartment.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.150
Maybe the real shooter.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.108
Curtis was informing
on his crew.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.589
Boomer and Red could've
figured it out. I mean...

17:48.632 --> 17:50.460
I don't know.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.114
I mean, it's a good
theory, Patton,

17:52.158 --> 17:54.073
but not enough to bring to NOPD.

17:54.116 --> 17:57.076
Sebastian is at the crime scene.Right.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.034
If someone else shot Franklin...

17:59.078 --> 18:00.862
Right....there'll be evidence.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.169
Okay, you call Sebastian.
I'll fill Lasalle in.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.823
Leaves one burning question,
though.
What?

18:05.867 --> 18:08.130
Who's Riley?

18:08.174 --> 18:10.089
Don't know who Riley is,

18:10.132 --> 18:12.439
but I'll contact Pride,
see what he can find out.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.441
All right,
got to go, Gregorio.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.139
What's that about?

18:17.183 --> 18:20.186
Oh, just checking back
with NCIS.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.579
What are you not
telling me, Lasalle?

18:22.623 --> 18:24.190
I'm just keeping this thing

18:24.233 --> 18:26.105
from going sideways.
Let's keep it at that.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.236
You know, Pride's
a friend of mine.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.803
I want to see this
end peacefully.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.152
If you know something,

18:30.196 --> 18:31.501
you've got to t...No, nothing worth mentioning.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.113
All right? Not yet.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.244
All right.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.898
Fine. All right, listen,
I got us a plane

18:36.941 --> 18:38.508
at Lakefront piloted
by a state trooper.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.119
Transit's gonna loan us a bus

18:40.162 --> 18:42.164
to transport the
suspects to the airport.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.079
LASALLE: Good. Means we can
keep the negotiations going

18:44.123 --> 18:46.168
and back Captain Davis off.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.474
Yeah, well, we're all
doing what we can.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.171
Okay.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.825
Let's call Boomer.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.131
Give him the news
about the plane.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.621
PRIDE:
Vince?

19:04.665 --> 19:06.971
Hey. Hey, hey,
Vince, you all right?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.930
I don't know, D-man.
I feel funny.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.540
BOOMER:
No talking.
Okay.

19:10.584 --> 19:13.152
All right, come on, sit down.
He's got a heart condition.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.545
And I got shin splints.
Who gives a crap?

19:15.589 --> 19:16.981
SYDNEY: He's not
looking good.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.200
I have some
field medical training.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.289
If you untie me,
I can examine him.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.725
So you can go round two?
That's a hard no.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.205
Right, then I'll do it.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.554
Get back to where you were,

19:24.598 --> 19:26.339
or I'll give Vince
a real problem.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.080
Threatening the man
isn't gonna change anything.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.432
Hey, Boomer. It's the cops.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.174
Let's hear if they got
good news for us.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.265
This better be good.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.270
BOOMER:
Yeah? Yeah, okay.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.404
:
What's your guy say?

19:48.448 --> 19:50.885
It's possible

19:50.928 --> 19:53.279
that Franklin didn't send
the last text.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.455
Someone else
has his phone.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.804
See, I told you
I'm innocent.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.240
It's possible.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.807
It's not a lot to go on.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.025
BOOMER: It's not good enough!PRIDE: The text mentioned

20:01.069 --> 20:02.026
someone named Riley.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.114
Who is that?

20:03.158 --> 20:04.681
Riley Egan. My girl.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.379
But she's been out of the life
for a couple years.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.032
She's a citizen now.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.425
Then why was she mentioned
in the text?

20:09.469 --> 20:12.036
She had an issue at the
club where she waitresses.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.256
Got jumped
after her shift last Friday.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.823
She begged me not
to get involved.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.433
You asked Franklin
to look into it.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.827
You think he got killed
over her?

20:19.870 --> 20:22.786
Wait, is she in danger?

20:22.830 --> 20:25.224
Curtis, relax. Okay,
we don't know anything yet.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.269
Give me the name of the club.
My people will look into it.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.271
The Blue Diamond.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.403
On St. Charles.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.275
BOOMER: All right,
then. Hurry up!

20:33.319 --> 20:34.189
That is what

20:34.233 --> 20:35.277
I am talking about!

20:35.321 --> 20:36.452
Stupid cops.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.237
I knew I'd get it.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.283
Curtis, you got us
into this mess,

20:41.327 --> 20:42.806
and I'm getting us out.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.418
NOPD just got us a plane
and a bus to get to it.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.812
You can thank
me on our way to Cuba.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.206
Looks like you're getting
your bar back in one piece.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.602
Vince. Hey, hey. You all right?

20:55.645 --> 20:57.299
Easy, easy.
All right, breathe, my brother.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.953
What's this now?

20:58.996 --> 21:01.999
PRIDE: Listen, listen here.
Breathe, breath.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.610
No, no, that's my phone.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.309
Red... take Curtis's gun

21:07.353 --> 21:08.571
and keep him covered.

21:08.615 --> 21:09.833
Why?

21:09.877 --> 21:11.226
Because according
to these texts,

21:11.270 --> 21:12.619
he's a snitch.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.231
BOOMER:
Put the gun down.

21:17.580 --> 21:20.191
And I'm thinking
that makes D-Man here...

21:21.280 --> 21:22.411
...a cop.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.252
Get up!

21:38.035 --> 21:38.906
Come on, move!

21:39.907 --> 21:41.169
You all right?

21:41.212 --> 21:43.040
Yeah? Okay.

21:43.084 --> 21:45.869
No, Boomer.
No, man.

21:47.349 --> 21:50.178
I knew there was
something off about you.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.267
What's your real name, D

21:52.311 --> 21:54.400
Dwayne Pride. NCIS.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.012
The Clearwater guy?

22:00.841 --> 22:02.146
Hey!

22:02.190 --> 22:04.540
You're the reason
half my family's out of work!

22:04.584 --> 22:07.021
Boomer, man, please...And, you, it was one thing

22:07.064 --> 22:08.762
when I thought you shot a cop,

22:08.805 --> 22:10.285
but you were his CI.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.330
You set us up!

22:11.373 --> 22:13.157
No! I'm the one who got set up.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.725
Those cops want to kill me.They're gonna have to
get in line.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.380
Hold on. You know what happens
if you pull that trigger?

22:18.424 --> 22:19.294
Huh?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.383
Every cop out there opens fire.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.733
He's right. And we
got a getaway plan.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.387
Bus is on its way.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.171
Don't be stupid, Red.
They're just stalling.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.217
Can't you hear what's
going on upstairs?

22:29.260 --> 22:31.088
Yeah, that's the TAC unit.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.134
They're looking
to put a camera inside.

22:33.177 --> 22:34.396
Protocol.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.312
DAVIS: My guys have a camera in place.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.097
Image should be
coming up... now.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.361
ESTES:
Here we go.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.928
We're finished.No.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.974
No, you don't have to be.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.976
You can still walk out of here.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.586
And spend life in Angola?

22:50.630 --> 22:52.632
Not life.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.416
Not if you listen to me.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.071
Why would I listen to you?
You've been talking to the cops.

22:57.114 --> 22:58.507
No, I've been talking
to my team.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.597
We're trying to solve
Detective Franklin's murder.

23:01.641 --> 23:02.903
What does that matter to me?

23:02.946 --> 23:06.123
Because if Curtis
is innocent

23:06.167 --> 23:10.084
and we can prove it,
then you've got leverage.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.694
You've got a chance
at freedom.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.696
:
Sounds good to me.

23:21.051 --> 23:23.140
Out of curiosity,

23:23.184 --> 23:26.056
what would you need for this
little plan of yours to work?

23:27.318 --> 23:29.886
Need you to lower your weapon.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.324
Give me back the phone.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.936
And one more thing.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.067
So much for the
pink of health.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.068
That hostage
looks half dead.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.243
And the girl tied
to the chair

23:39.287 --> 23:40.027
looks like
she's bleeding.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.289
We got to go in.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.682
I'll give my men
the go signal.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.466
Hold on. It's not
what it looks like.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.163
All right, that man
is Vince Gooding.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.165
He's got a heart condition.
They're letting him go.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.384
He needs an ER.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.951
How the hell could you
possibly know that?

23:50.994 --> 23:53.170
Look, I just do, all right?
We need to clear the front,

23:53.214 --> 23:54.955
get the paramedics ready.
Hold your fire.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.826
I'm not doing a damn thing
until you tell me how you know.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.002
LEROI: We got movement at
the front, Captain.
May get a clear shot.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.570
Okay.I've been texting with Pride.

24:01.614 --> 24:04.181
The reason you didn't tell us?Because we're investigating

24:04.225 --> 24:05.966
who really killed
Detective Franklin.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.621
The suspects with the
guns killed Franklin.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.013
I'm not so sure
about that, Captain.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.406
Really

24:11.450 --> 24:12.973
I promise I'll tell you
everything--

24:13.016 --> 24:15.105
soon as you get your snipers
to stand down

24:15.149 --> 24:16.237
and let that man out.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.980
What are we doing?

24:20.023 --> 24:21.895
This is Captain Davis.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.897
All units stand down.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.638
Hostage is
being released.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.248
Needs medical attention.

24:37.737 --> 24:40.435
Releasing a hostage,
he needs medical attention.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.915
Special Agent Lasalle,
time for you to spill.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.612
Why are you so sure
that Curtis is innocent?

24:43.656 --> 24:45.440
Text transcripts between
him and Franklin

24:45.484 --> 24:47.224
had a very specific code.

24:47.268 --> 24:48.487
How'd you get
those transcripts?

24:48.530 --> 24:50.532
Doesn't matter.
The last text Franklin sent

24:50.576 --> 24:51.925
skipped the code completely.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.535
We think someone else wrote it.

24:53.579 --> 24:56.582
Text syntax is not proof.

24:56.625 --> 24:59.106
Plus, two NOPD officers saw
Curtis fleeing the scene,

24:59.149 --> 25:02.022
murder weapon on the ground
with Curtis's prints.I know.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.719
Which is why I wasn't
gonna mention anything

25:03.763 --> 25:05.155
until we found more evidence.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.244
And what kind of evidence
would that be?

25:07.288 --> 25:08.202
The reason Franklin
was killed

25:08.245 --> 25:09.551
in the first place--
we think

25:09.595 --> 25:11.727
it's got something to do
with Curtis's girlfriend.

25:11.771 --> 25:14.034
We're trying to save
your boss's life,

25:14.077 --> 25:15.731
and you're running a
shadow investigation

25:15.775 --> 25:17.428
to prove a killer's
innocence?

25:17.472 --> 25:20.301
Yeah, it's probably the only way
to end this standoff peacefully.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.999
Estes, get this man out of here
before I have him arrested.

25:28.396 --> 25:29.571
Sebastian, where have you been?

25:29.615 --> 25:32.356
I'm at Detective Franklin's
crime scene.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.010
Uh, it's been a bit of a day.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.142
Why are you whispering?

25:35.185 --> 25:36.447
Well, I-I figured that Homicide

25:36.491 --> 25:38.972
would be happy to have me help
gather evidence.

25:39.015 --> 25:41.931
You know, I even offered
to process the murder weapon.

25:41.975 --> 25:44.151
Based on my current situation,

25:44.194 --> 25:45.979
I'm guessing
they felt territorial.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.763
Yeah. Technically,
they-they kicked me out.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.286
But it's okay--
I snuck back in.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.592
Sebastian, be careful.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.812
Yeah, I know, I know.
But I was able to take

25:52.855 --> 25:54.553
high-def digital images of the,
uh, the murder weapon

25:54.596 --> 25:57.077
and the body, so I'm
gonna run 'em back to the lab

25:57.120 --> 25:58.208
right now.Where's Gregorio?

25:58.252 --> 25:59.949
She went to the-the club

25:59.993 --> 26:01.951
where Curtis's
girlfriend Riley works.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.301
I don't know, I'll...
I'll keep you updated.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.042
Unless I get arrested
on my way to my car.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.304
I-I got to go.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.616
LORNA:
I wish I knew where Riley is.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.444
She hasn't been in for days.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.315
I'm covering her shifts.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.579
Manager's kind of pissed.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.581
Especially with all
these cops coming in.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.452
NOPD came by today?

26:24.495 --> 26:28.325
No. Last week,
before she disappeared.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.240
Was it Detective Franklin?

26:30.284 --> 26:31.677
No.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.679
He was black.
He didn't flash his badge,

26:33.722 --> 26:35.681
but I could tell
he was a cop.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.683
He spoke with
Riley alone, and...

26:37.726 --> 26:39.641
she was freaked out after.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.470
Any idea why she
was freaked out?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.213
Look...

26:46.256 --> 26:47.562
I need this job.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.869
I'm not trying to get involved
in anything.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.261
:
Listen.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.263
It's just between us.

26:55.222 --> 26:59.574
Riley said he was asking about
one of her regulars-- Desi.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.228
She saw someone put
something in his drink,

27:01.271 --> 27:04.057
and he had a real bad
car accident after.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.319
Talking a roofie, or...?

27:05.362 --> 27:07.277
I don't know,
maybe. But...

27:07.321 --> 27:09.845
the night after the cop came,
Riley got jumped.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.499
I haven't seen her since.

27:11.542 --> 27:14.110
What can you tell me about Desi?

27:15.155 --> 27:17.200
This is a private club.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.811
We're not allowed
to talk about customers,

27:18.854 --> 27:20.639
but especially not him.I get it.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.292
VIP.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.470
He works for the city,
or the government.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.255
He's a real big deal.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.083
Kind of sweet on Riley.

27:30.126 --> 27:32.433
And he barely survived
the accident.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.740
That... that's all I know.

27:39.962 --> 27:43.270
Curtis, what do you know
about this customer, Desi?

27:43.313 --> 27:46.229
He tips big, he's nice--
that's all Riley ever said.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.841
You believe this crap?
Our lives are on the line,
and he's rapping about

27:48.884 --> 27:50.277
some guy who had
the hots for his girl.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.495
He didn't have
the hots for Riley.

27:51.539 --> 27:52.758
And she's in real
trouble here.

27:52.801 --> 27:53.889
PRIDE: Hey. We're gonna
find her, Curtis.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.369
Need you to tell me

27:55.412 --> 27:56.936
anything you know
about this Desi.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.415
He's a lawyer, I think.

27:58.459 --> 27:59.634
A prosecutor?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.114
Like a D.A., or...?Great. Another cop.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.724
Hey. They're trying
to save your ass.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.117
You want to back off?

28:04.160 --> 28:04.944
Stop it.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.729
Curtis.Bigger than a D.A.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.992
He comes in from Baton Rouge
once a month or so.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.299
Desmond Whitney?

28:12.342 --> 28:14.431
State attorney general?

28:14.475 --> 28:16.433
Yeah, that sounds right.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.000
Mean something
to you, Sherlock?

28:18.044 --> 28:21.438
He's been waging a war
on municipal corruption.

28:21.482 --> 28:24.920
Car crash nearly killed him
maybe a week ago.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.182
RED:
Corruption?

28:26.226 --> 28:27.575
Like dirty politicians?

28:27.618 --> 28:28.663
Politicians...

28:28.707 --> 28:31.057
city officials, cops...

28:31.100 --> 28:33.363
Are you saying someone tried
to take Whitney out?

28:33.407 --> 28:35.452
Not someone. A cop.

28:35.496 --> 28:38.281
Like I always said, you guys
are just as bad as the crooks.

28:38.325 --> 28:41.632
Riley contacts the police,
she's attacked;

28:41.676 --> 28:44.810
then Franklin looks into it,
he's murdered.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.812
Fascinating. But you still
don't know who did it.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.248
Now, come on, ticktock.Hey, look,

28:48.291 --> 28:49.640
I know it's not much,

28:49.684 --> 28:51.860
but it could be your
ticket out of here.

28:51.904 --> 28:54.341
Our ticket just arrived.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.735
Bus is here.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.304
Bus is in position.

29:01.348 --> 29:03.306
What happens when it
gets to the airport?

29:03.350 --> 29:05.308
Bus gets to the fence,

29:05.352 --> 29:07.136
they'll have to walk
to the plane.
Right.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.877
That's our moment.My team will be

29:08.921 --> 29:10.487
at this hangar building--
Beta Team can be placed

29:10.531 --> 29:12.359
behind the electrical box
on the other side.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.274
We'll take them down
or we'll take them out.

29:14.317 --> 29:16.015
The idea is
to take them alive, right?

29:17.103 --> 29:18.191
Of course.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.149
I thought I told you to leave.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.934
Well, I got another
text from Pride.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.370
Detective Franklin's murder

29:23.413 --> 29:25.154
is a lot more complicated
than you think.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.808
Get your men to the airport.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.463
Got it.Look, I know we could
have handled this better,

29:29.506 --> 29:32.205
but we think a cop
is responsible for
Franklin's death.

29:32.248 --> 29:35.512
Every time I think you've hit
bottom, you manage to get lower.

29:35.556 --> 29:37.776
It's got something to do
with the attorney general,
Desmond Whitney.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.429
Say another word,

29:39.473 --> 29:42.432
I will put cuffs on you myself.Hey, hey! Come on!

29:42.476 --> 29:43.694
They got hostages, man!

29:43.738 --> 29:44.913
Same team! Same team!

29:44.957 --> 29:46.306
Get him out of here!Let's go.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.656
Let's go. Out. Out.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.746
Okay, gang,

29:51.790 --> 29:53.313
time for a road trip.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.619
No, no, no, no, no.
Everyone stay where you are.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.970
You don't need all
these people to get out.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.623
You just need one.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.190
Me.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.236
Otherwise, we have a problem.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.412
You got brass ones,
I'll give you that.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.806
I don't give a crap
about the snitch,

30:07.849 --> 30:09.459
but Red and me,
we need cover,

30:09.503 --> 30:12.027
and one is just
not gonna cut it.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.550
Then take me, too.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.560
Really testing
your luck here.

30:23.604 --> 30:25.649
Yeah, I'm not gonna
abandon Pride.

30:25.693 --> 30:27.782
Train's barreling down the track
no matter where youare,

30:27.826 --> 30:29.523
Lasalle.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.656
Got movement at the door.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.223
Copy that.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.238
If I smell even a
whiff of trouble,

30:49.282 --> 30:50.718
you and the girl die.

30:50.761 --> 30:51.762
That's a promise.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.504
Where's Captain Davis?

30:54.548 --> 30:56.463
Right at the epicenter.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.439
Walk!

31:16.483 --> 31:17.876
Come on! Move!

31:26.058 --> 31:27.537
Sit down. Get comfortable.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.498
: Pretty sure
the driver's an NOPD captain.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.803
Might complicate things.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.023
'Cause they've
been easy so far?

31:39.593 --> 31:42.161
You're with the hostages.

31:44.641 --> 31:47.122
Okay, driver. Let's roll.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.784
We're on the move.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.307
Air support
will keep close cover.

31:58.351 --> 31:59.787
Additional units
clear the roads.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.571
Hey, you put Captain
Davis on the bus?

32:01.615 --> 32:04.139
He put himself there. Look,
I got to get to the airport.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.445
All right, I'm coming with you.

32:05.488 --> 32:06.794
You'll end up in jail if you do.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.361
I don't care.
I'm the only link to Pride,

32:08.404 --> 32:10.363
and NCIS
are the only ones trying

32:10.406 --> 32:11.930
to solve Franklin's murder.

32:14.149 --> 32:16.325
You really think
Curtis is innocent?

32:16.369 --> 32:17.848
We're doing everything we can
to prove it

32:17.892 --> 32:19.763
and try to catch
the real killer.

32:24.464 --> 32:27.119
Fine. You can walk me
through your theory

32:27.162 --> 32:28.947
on the way to the airport.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.135
REPORTER: This is WUVV Sky 5
reporting...

32:43.178 --> 32:45.789
I'm guessing that bus has
Pride and the suspects on it?

32:45.833 --> 32:48.488
Yeah, and it's on its
way to the airport.
We're running out of time.

32:48.531 --> 32:50.664
Any luck tracking down
Riley Egan?No. She's gone.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.535
You think she went into hiding
after getting attacked?

32:52.579 --> 32:54.929
I put a BOLO out. But if we're
really looking at a dirty cop,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.323
he could get
to her first.I can't tell you

32:57.366 --> 32:58.889
if a cop killed
Detective Franklin,

32:58.933 --> 33:00.674
but we're pretty damn sure
Curtis didn't.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.893
Yeah, I was able to run prints
off the photos I took

33:02.937 --> 33:04.895
of the murder weapon.Those aren't Curtis's?

33:04.939 --> 33:06.897
They are absolutely Curtis's.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.682
Four perfect prints
on the gun's handle.

33:08.725 --> 33:10.336
How does that clear him
as a suspect?

33:10.379 --> 33:11.946
Well, these aren't
the latent prints

33:11.990 --> 33:13.774
that you typically find
at a crime scene.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.081
And there's no smudging
or imperfections. These,

33:16.124 --> 33:17.647
these are exemplar prints.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.085
That's what the cops collect
when they arrest a suspect.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.869
Yeah. They were planted
on the gun.Well, even if they

33:21.912 --> 33:24.698
were planted, we still need
more to clear his name.

33:24.741 --> 33:27.788
How 'bout this? Got
surveillance from a liquor store

33:27.831 --> 33:29.485
down the block
from Franklin's crime scene.

33:29.529 --> 33:30.921
Get a view
of the killer?

33:30.965 --> 33:33.707
No. Camera's pointed
in the wrong direction.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.187
But I got audio.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.191
Well, how does that help us?

33:39.234 --> 33:41.976
Well, the-the time stamp says
that the gunshot

33:42.020 --> 33:43.978
was fired
at 11:24, right?Right.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.763
Well, the text that sent Curtis
to the crime scene,

33:46.807 --> 33:48.417
that went out at 11:25.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.685
And how does a dead man text?

33:55.729 --> 33:57.078
Curtis was set up
to take the fall.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.688
Okay, we can work with this,
but we still need

33:58.732 --> 34:00.864
to I.D. the real killer.

34:00.908 --> 34:01.909
Unfortunately,
only Riley Egan

34:01.952 --> 34:03.650
can answer that question.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.913
That's not gonna
happen. This is Wade.

34:05.956 --> 34:08.437
Riley Egan's in autopsy.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.836
WADE:
Jane Doe

34:15.879 --> 34:16.880
came in two days ago.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.708
When your BOLO
came through,

34:18.752 --> 34:20.275
age and description
matched.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.929
That's Riley Egan.

34:21.972 --> 34:23.931
C.O.D. was
apparent heroin overdose.

34:23.974 --> 34:25.454
Apparent

34:25.498 --> 34:27.761
The victim shows no signs
of previous drug use.

34:27.804 --> 34:32.070
Plus, the quality of heroin in
her system was off the charts.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.463
92% pure.

34:34.507 --> 34:37.684
Most street-level
heroin is a third of that.

34:37.727 --> 34:39.077
This came straight
from the distributor.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.904
That might be
our only good news.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.558
At this purity level,

34:42.602 --> 34:45.039
the chemical compound
will be easy to trace.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.563
Means Narcotics may be able
to tell me where it came from.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.348
Thanks, Doc.Listen, I've been stuck
in here all day.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.828
Haven't heard any news
on Dwayne. Is he okay?

34:51.872 --> 34:54.048
Yeah, he's fine.
You know, he can handle himself.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.442
You didn't answer my question.

34:56.485 --> 34:59.662
It's the best I can do
right now, Doc.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.070
What is it?

35:17.071 --> 35:18.725
Riley.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.119
She's dead.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.165
Looks like an overdose.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.166
I'm sorry, Curtis.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.428
That doesn't make any sense.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.995
She never did drugs.

35:28.038 --> 35:29.562
She was murdered
like your cop friend.

35:29.605 --> 35:32.042
You got a cloud of bad luck that
follows you wherever you go.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.914
Show some respect for the guy.

35:33.957 --> 35:35.220
I got zero respect to give.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.224
Whoever did this to Riley
probably killed

35:39.267 --> 35:40.268
Franklin, too.

35:40.312 --> 35:41.269
We'll find him.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.879
When?

35:42.923 --> 35:44.707
'Cause that's the airport.

35:59.113 --> 36:00.810
Bus has arrived
at the fence line.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.725
Copy that.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.339
Yo, driver, what gives?

36:07.382 --> 36:09.645
Waiting for them
to open the gate.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.738
ESTES: All right, Captain Davis,
we're about to open the gate.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.392
All units ready in position.

36:17.436 --> 36:18.959
Alpha Team in position.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.614
Beta Team in position.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.401
Davis's men are setting
a kill zone.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.316
We're still trying
to save lives here, right?

36:28.360 --> 36:31.145
Look, Lasalle, when
Davis gives us the high sign,

36:31.189 --> 36:32.581
we open the gate.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.235
They'll head on foot
to the plane.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.150
Davis will cover from behind
and we move in.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.761
That's about as flimsy a plan
as I've ever heard.

36:38.805 --> 36:41.329
Captain Davis has 15 years
in the SOD.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.244
He knows the drill.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.900
We're out of time,
Sebastian.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.119
Give me good news.I just ran
the chemical signature

36:49.163 --> 36:51.600
on the heroin used
to kill Riley Egan.

36:51.644 --> 36:55.038
It matches a narcotics seizure
made by NOPD months ago.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.867
Lasalle, Captain Steven Davis
led the raid.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.956
Wait, are you sure?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.436
Positive.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.483
Tell SOD to stand down
right now.

37:04.526 --> 37:07.050
I think Davis is our killer.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.749
DAVIS:
Hey, what are you doing?

37:09.792 --> 37:11.533
Stop pointing that gun at me.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.013
What are you...
what are you talking about?

37:13.056 --> 37:15.885
DAVIS:
Please don't shoot me!

37:15.929 --> 37:17.539
BOOMER: What are...
what are you talking about?

37:25.286 --> 37:26.548
Go, go, go!

37:26.592 --> 37:27.984
All right, everybody down!
Get on the ground now!

37:47.874 --> 37:48.831
Tell them to hold
their fire!

37:48.875 --> 37:49.963
This is
Captain Estes!

37:50.006 --> 37:52.574
Cease fire!
I repeat, cease fire!

37:52.618 --> 37:53.749
Davis is in there
and in trouble!

37:53.793 --> 37:54.881
Not losing another cop!

37:54.924 --> 37:55.882
Listen to me, Leroi!

37:55.925 --> 37:57.753
Davis may be responsible

37:57.797 --> 37:59.712
for Franklin's death!I don't believe it!

37:59.755 --> 38:01.801
You don't have to yet!
All right? Just hold your fire!

38:01.844 --> 38:03.716
Otherwise you're gonna kill
a lot of innocent people!

38:05.805 --> 38:07.459
This is Alpha Team leader.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.069
Hold fire!

38:09.112 --> 38:11.767
Copy, Alpha Team leader.
We're holding fire.

38:12.768 --> 38:13.682
PRIDE: Okay?I'm fine.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.208
I've been shot.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.775
You freakin' played me!

38:19.819 --> 38:21.168
You're gonna
die, D

38:24.867 --> 38:25.694
Davis, what are you doing?

38:25.738 --> 38:26.869
Cleaning house.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.088
I can't let you do that.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.698
You don't really have a say
here, Pride.

38:43.016 --> 38:45.671
It's okay! It's over!
It's over!

38:45.714 --> 38:47.890
Suspects are down!

38:47.934 --> 38:50.197
Red's wounded. He
needs medical attention.

38:50.240 --> 38:53.548
Come on. Come on.

38:56.725 --> 39:00.599
Whoa. H-Hang on.
Curtis, Curtis is innocent.

39:00.642 --> 39:03.166
The killer's
on the bus.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.040
Boomer?

39:07.083 --> 39:08.258
Didn't make it.

39:08.302 --> 39:09.608
All right.
You need to get checked out.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.174
I'll take custody of Curtis.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.785
Won't let anything
happen to him.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.221
You can trust him.

39:14.264 --> 39:16.179
Okay?

39:18.181 --> 39:19.444
You okay?

39:19.487 --> 39:21.794
Yeah. So much for putting
the "big" in "easy."

39:21.837 --> 39:23.752
I've had more relaxing days
in Fallujah.

39:23.796 --> 39:27.016
I'm sorry. And, uh,
who are you, exactly?

39:27.060 --> 39:30.019
Christopher, this is Halliday.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.849
She's been making a habit
of saving my ass.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.423
♪

39:47.210 --> 39:49.691
Well, I'm
sorry I'm late,

39:49.735 --> 39:50.779
but I did not come empty-handed.

39:50.823 --> 39:53.086
:
I brought the donuts!

39:55.131 --> 39:56.829
You guys hear what I said?
'Cause I said...

39:56.872 --> 39:58.178
:
I brought the donuts!

39:58.221 --> 40:00.093
Day late and a dollar
short, Sebastian.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.790
Take a look.

40:01.834 --> 40:02.835
SEBASTIAN:
What the...?

40:02.878 --> 40:04.184
Who brought those?

40:04.227 --> 40:05.577
I bought a dozen.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.969
And I bought two
to be safe.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.754
And I brought strudel

40:08.797 --> 40:11.060
for that international feel.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.845
Wonderful. Great. Okay.
You know what,

40:12.888 --> 40:14.455
I think we're all just
overcompensating a little bit

40:14.499 --> 40:15.804
for Sonja's absence.
But it's cool.

40:15.848 --> 40:16.805
We'll figure it out.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.067
I think we have already.

40:18.111 --> 40:19.895
We solved two murders,
ended a hostage crisis,

40:19.939 --> 40:21.810
and saved Pride
all in a single afternoon.

40:21.854 --> 40:23.725
We're a well-oiled machine.

40:23.769 --> 40:25.684
Great. So who's making coffee?

40:25.727 --> 40:28.469
: Are you serious?Not me.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.128
Pride. Oh.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.999
Hey, Carl.Let me help you.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.740
Yeah. Thank you.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.568
Where we going
with this?

40:40.612 --> 40:42.352
Over there.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.007
I looked for you at
headquarters. Said you split.

40:45.051 --> 40:47.793
Figured after a night's worth
of questioning,

40:47.836 --> 40:49.229
nobody'd miss me.

40:49.272 --> 40:50.796
Right here?Yep.

40:50.839 --> 40:53.451
Thank you.Well, I, uh,

40:53.494 --> 40:55.148
thought you should know

40:55.191 --> 40:57.542
that Curtis isn't facing
any charges for yesterday.

40:57.585 --> 40:59.239
Thanks to you
and your people.

40:59.282 --> 41:00.893
Well, I'm glad.

41:00.936 --> 41:04.766
But Curtis paid a big price
for his freedom.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.160
Well, freedom isn't in the cards
for him quite yet.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.510
I'm placing him in protective
custody until I'm sure

41:09.554 --> 41:12.121
no other cops were
working with Davis.

41:12.165 --> 41:14.907
Someone tried to take out
the state attorney general.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.432
Right.Man who was fighting corruption.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.392
Davis was covering it up.

41:22.436 --> 41:24.873
Can't imagine he did it alone.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.006
And a few months back,
you had to save Mayor Taylor

41:27.049 --> 41:30.052
from a murder attempt
the day before the election.

41:30.096 --> 41:32.968
Think it's connected?Two high-profile

41:33.012 --> 41:36.885
politicians almost assassinated
in the same year.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.934
You thinking what I'm thinking?

41:43.283 --> 41:45.894
Smoke, there's fire.
