00:02.287 --> 00:03.919
You are being watched.

00:04.986 --> 00:06.989
The government has a secret system--

00:07.310 --> 00:10.768
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.515 --> 00:13.637
I know, because I built it.

00:14.219 --> 00:17.855
I designed the machine to detect acts
of terror, but it sees everything...

00:18.205 --> 00:22.055
Violent crimes involving
ordinary people, people like you,

00:22.595 --> 00:24.945
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.697 --> 00:28.249
They wouldn't act, so
I decided I would.

00:28.616 --> 00:32.561
But I needed a partner-- Someone
with the skills to intervene.

00:34.428 --> 00:38.109
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:38.427 --> 00:39.809
You will never find us.

00:39.952 --> 00:44.922
But, victim or perpetrator, if
your number's up, we'll find you.

When you find that one person
who connects you to the world,

01:02.165 --> 01:04.224
you become someone different...

01:05.625 --> 01:07.649
Someone better.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.677
When that person is taken from you...

01:17.359 --> 01:18.562
Wait for me.

01:19.604 --> 01:21.625
What do you become then?

01:24.256 --> 01:25.926
Are you okay, mister?

01:31.169 --> 01:32.936
What happened to you?

01:37.321 --> 01:39.609
I think I quit my job.

01:39.968 --> 01:42.040
Next stop, New Rochelle.

01:52.836 --> 01:54.307
Morning, Finch.

01:56.335 --> 01:58.955
You're off to an
early start, Mr. Reese.

01:59.273 --> 02:01.563
Maybe I'm trying
to impress the boss.

02:01.670 --> 02:03.107
Should have called first.

02:03.412 --> 02:06.203
As it stands, our
docket is clear.

02:06.872 --> 02:08.017
We don't have a number?

02:08.113 --> 02:09.339
You sound disappointed.

02:09.434 --> 02:11.268
Oh, a little surprised.

02:11.543 --> 02:15.100
No one in New York is in danger
or planning to hurt someone?

02:15.362 --> 02:17.468
If they are, they're
keeping it to themselves.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.574
Anyway, I think you've
earned some time off.

02:19.665 --> 02:21.319
Especially today.

02:22.364 --> 02:24.096
Or did you think I didn't know?

02:27.006 --> 02:28.605
Happy Birthday.

02:30.426 --> 02:31.282
Thanks.

02:31.390 --> 02:32.490
You're welcome.
Now go.

02:32.607 --> 02:34.446
Do whatever you do
when you're not here.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.670
You don't know what that is?

02:38.759 --> 02:40.654
I respect your privacy, John.

02:41.808 --> 02:43.410
Obviously.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.792
Cannon 8 to 6.

03:15.448 --> 03:18.011
Horse 2 to 3.

03:19.411 --> 03:21.018
Are you sure?

03:21.585 --> 03:22.901
You tell me, Han.

03:23.008 --> 03:27.578
As I recall, John, you don't
make any move you're not sure of.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.963
You're not working today?

03:30.490 --> 03:32.512
My boss gave me the day off.

03:33.153 --> 03:34.448
It's my birthday.

03:35.705 --> 03:37.294
Sheng ri kuai le.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.682
Thank you.

03:39.544 --> 03:41.113
Did you get any gifts?

03:41.484 --> 03:42.617
One.

03:53.232 --> 03:54.755
A key?

03:55.701 --> 03:56.939
To what?

03:58.004 --> 03:59.667
Good question.

04:06.377 --> 04:07.620
Detective Carter.

04:08.955 --> 04:10.531
Special Agent Donnelly.

04:10.637 --> 04:12.660
How goes your hunt
for our mystery man?

04:12.748 --> 04:13.565
That's why I'm here.

04:13.649 --> 04:15.970
I promised I'd keep you in the
loop on our investigation.

04:18.148 --> 04:21.379
So... we'd been looking into a
smuggling ring that was broken

04:21.471 --> 04:22.913
up a couple of months back.

04:22.989 --> 04:25.376
The leader was suspected of
having CIA ties, but he skipped

04:25.460 --> 04:26.830
before he could be charged.

04:26.922 --> 04:27.621
I recall.

04:27.705 --> 04:29.978
Yeah, well, we think your
guy was working for him.

04:30.288 --> 04:33.259
CSU found prints and some
carbonized blood, along with

04:33.337 --> 04:36.070
the body of a member of the ring,
in the trunk of a burned-out car.

04:36.219 --> 04:39.408
When they ran the blood, they got
a DNA hit on a cold case up

04:39.516 --> 04:41.805
in New Rochelle from 2011.

04:42.152 --> 04:43.172
What kind of cold case?

04:43.282 --> 04:44.908
Suspected homicide.

04:45.073 --> 04:47.129
Real estate developer
named Peter Arndt.

04:47.274 --> 04:48.693
Real estate developer?

04:48.792 --> 04:50.712
Yeah. Arndt was up to
his eyeballs in debt.

04:50.846 --> 04:52.088
Lost his investors' money.

04:52.193 --> 04:55.662
We think one of them had him taken
out, hired your guy to do the job.

04:55.777 --> 04:57.316
And he made some mistakes.

04:58.050 --> 05:01.854
Now someone in New Rochelle has to know
something, and then we'll be close.

05:01.953 --> 05:02.994
Close to what?

05:03.066 --> 05:05.371
Finding out who
this man really is.

05:07.909 --> 05:10.269
Well, um, thank you
for the update.

05:10.399 --> 05:11.959
How'd you like to assist?

05:12.042 --> 05:12.858
Assist?

05:12.937 --> 05:13.734
Up in New Rochelle.

05:13.827 --> 05:16.114
- I would love to, but, uh--
- Think about it.

05:16.223 --> 05:17.933
I mean, you're the reason
we're onto this guy.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.417
You should
be a part of taking him down.

05:19.541 --> 05:21.091
- I'll let you know.
- Thanks.

05:26.216 --> 05:26.817
Yeah.

05:26.932 --> 05:27.973
Hello, detective?

05:28.083 --> 05:30.700
There's something I need
to discuss with you.

05:30.818 --> 05:31.715
Yeah?

05:32.235 --> 05:34.248
I got something for you too.

05:46.173 --> 05:48.514
Never pegged you as
the cues-and-brews type.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.348
All the more reason
to come here, detective.

05:50.457 --> 05:53.326
Once we become predictable,
we become vulnerable.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.330
If you say so.

05:54.416 --> 05:55.225
What can I get you?

05:55.308 --> 05:56.881
Uh, club soda for me.

05:56.970 --> 05:57.884
- Okay.
- Thanks.

05:58.553 --> 06:00.681
When I called, you said
you had something for me.

06:00.797 --> 06:03.194
You know about a case
up in New Rochelle?

06:04.750 --> 06:06.563
I'll take that as a "yes."

06:06.837 --> 06:10.232
FBI linked your your partner's
DNA to a crime scene.

06:10.727 --> 06:12.331
Agent Donnelly, no doubt.

06:12.427 --> 06:14.237
He wants me along for the ride.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.926
Perhaps that wouldn't
be such a bad thing?

06:16.050 --> 06:16.938
How do you mean?

06:17.013 --> 06:19.184
Well, if there was any
evidence that threatened our

06:19.277 --> 06:23.139
mutual friend, I'm confident that you
would find it before Donnelly would.

06:23.233 --> 06:26.761
Are you suggesting I obstruct
a federal investigation?

06:27.535 --> 06:31.462
Of course what you did with that
evidence would be entirely your concern.

06:34.675 --> 06:36.348
You wanted to talk
to me about something.

06:36.457 --> 06:37.723
Oh, it was nothing important.

06:37.922 --> 06:39.542
We'll talk again
when you get back.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.629
Thanks for the drink.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.608
Anything else?

06:53.992 --> 06:55.532
No, I'll just take
the check, please.

06:55.614 --> 06:56.917
Okay.

07:01.797 --> 07:02.992
Here you go.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.323
Thank you.

07:27.304 --> 07:28.744
This is Jessica, you missed me.

07:28.872 --> 07:30.314
Leave a message.

07:33.571 --> 07:34.297
Do you need any help?

07:34.393 --> 07:34.997
Yes.

07:35.098 --> 07:36.538
I'm looking for someone.

07:37.553 --> 07:39.265
A nurse.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.864
Jessica Arndt.

07:41.056 --> 07:42.069
I'm an old friend.

07:42.147 --> 07:43.408
She might not
work here anymore.

07:43.511 --> 07:45.668
She was always talking
about moving away.

07:45.763 --> 07:48.712
Um, I'm sorry to
have to tell you this.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.150
Jessica died in a car accident.

07:54.063 --> 07:55.931
About two months ago.

08:01.518 --> 08:03.419
She said she would wait.

08:03.540 --> 08:05.014
I'm so sorry.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.669
I think I have her husband's number
here, if you wanted to reach out.

08:17.379 --> 08:18.636
Sorry.

08:25.252 --> 08:26.357
Has she left the apartment?

08:26.490 --> 08:27.669
Not yet.

08:27.987 --> 08:29.940
Hey, what's your interest in
this broad anyway, Finch?

08:30.073 --> 08:31.303
It's not your concern.

08:31.401 --> 08:32.272
Just keep an eye out.

08:32.408 --> 08:34.142
Karen Garner.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.695
She's wanted for identity
theft, passing bad checks.

08:36.796 --> 08:37.702
Warrant's out of Detroit.

08:37.792 --> 08:38.581
Your girl's a felon.

08:38.659 --> 08:41.682
Yes, I'm aware of her apparent
troubles with the law, detective.

08:41.801 --> 08:43.738
But I'm more concerned
that she may be in danger.

08:43.839 --> 08:44.622
What makes you think that?

08:44.703 --> 08:46.143
Karen Garner is an alias.

08:46.230 --> 08:48.124
It's only been around
for three months.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.899
She has no credit history, she
only leaves the apartment to go

08:50.991 --> 08:53.336
to work, and she's constantly
looking over her shoulder.

08:53.422 --> 08:54.678
Sounds like she's hiding out.

08:54.786 --> 08:56.359
Or on the run, more likely.

08:56.447 --> 08:58.084
Maybe she's laying low,
trying to plan something.

08:58.178 --> 09:00.243
Yes, perhaps she's
a master criminal.

09:01.109 --> 09:04.694
But maybe she's just a scared woman trying
to stay a step ahead of her abuser.

09:04.858 --> 09:06.406
Yeah, right.

09:06.794 --> 09:07.723
Let me ask you
something, though.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.523
Why am I planted out here
instead of wonder boy?

09:09.611 --> 09:10.897
Mr. Reese is otherwise engaged.

09:11.008 --> 09:14.091
And you are not to contact him
regarding this matter, detective.

09:14.196 --> 09:16.307
You and I will handle
this ourselves.

09:48.179 --> 09:50.280
Detective Carter,
welcome to New Rochelle.

09:50.387 --> 09:52.122
Glad to see you took
me up on my offer.

09:52.472 --> 09:53.829
Here's what we know.

09:53.922 --> 09:56.766
Arndt was playing it fast and
loose with his investors' money.

09:56.889 --> 09:59.613
He ended up losing it on bad land
deals and a gambling habit.

09:59.762 --> 10:02.569
When he exhausted his line of
credit, he was forced to take

10:02.668 --> 10:04.787
money from less
reputable lenders.

10:04.876 --> 10:06.061
Loan sharks.

10:06.162 --> 10:08.048
His bookie gave us the name
of a couple local guys he

10:08.151 --> 10:10.364
introduced Arndt to, and
we're checking it out.

10:10.465 --> 10:12.139
Says he was married.

10:12.239 --> 10:13.151
"Wife deceased."

10:13.219 --> 10:14.026
What happened to her?

10:14.109 --> 10:15.148
In a car accident.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.130
Two months before
Arndt went missing.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.107
Bad one.

10:18.187 --> 10:19.405
She was killed, he nearly was.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.936
But anyway, by that point, Arndt
was completely under water.

10:23.041 --> 10:25.242
Shortly after he left the
hospital, he went missing.

10:26.613 --> 10:27.641
They find a body?

10:27.772 --> 10:31.585
No, but given the amount of blood
spilled, it's doubtful Arndt survived.

10:31.737 --> 10:33.479
Doesn't sound like my guy's MO.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.094
He usually covers his tracks.

10:35.191 --> 10:37.468
That's another reason we
think it was his first job.

10:37.577 --> 10:39.476
It was messy, violent.

10:40.211 --> 10:42.020
Probably figured it would be
easy, then found out he had a

10:42.119 --> 10:43.440
fight on his hands.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.423
We located one of
the loan sharks.

10:47.091 --> 10:48.773
Did you talk to the
local detectives?

10:48.875 --> 10:50.191
No, I had their
files sent over.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.598
I'd like to speak with them.

10:51.695 --> 10:53.657
Sure. Great.
Let me know if you find out anything.

10:53.788 --> 10:55.062
Will do.

11:15.607 --> 11:16.756
Anything yet, detective?

11:16.896 --> 11:18.364
Yep.
Our girl's on her way to work.

11:18.496 --> 11:19.280
And you're right.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.353
Someone's got
this girl spooked.

11:23.035 --> 11:24.487
How long am I gonna
have to tail her?

11:24.660 --> 11:28.005
Long enough for me to
identify who she's hiding from.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.667
Hey, did you see a
woman come through here?

11:33.784 --> 11:37.264
- Yes, she asked to use the
bathroom in the back. - Detective?

11:37.505 --> 11:38.597
Hang on.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.678
So if I were to speculate as
to the reason for your labored

11:53.772 --> 11:56.533
- breathing, detective--
- I lost her.

11:56.646 --> 11:57.568
That would be it.

11:57.712 --> 11:59.250
What do you want me to do?

11:59.441 --> 12:00.576
Go back to your day job.

12:00.669 --> 12:02.084
I'll handle it from here.

12:15.646 --> 12:17.155
Hey.
What can I get you?

12:17.277 --> 12:19.199
Oh, just some information.

12:19.335 --> 12:22.397
I was in here last night and I thought
I saw my neighbour working here--

12:22.486 --> 12:23.922
- Karen Garner?
- Yeah, that's right.

12:24.027 --> 12:26.751
I was passing by again, I
thought I'd see if I could catch her.

12:26.860 --> 12:29.207
Normally you would but
she called out today.

12:29.358 --> 12:30.236
Another time then.

12:30.324 --> 12:31.736
I'm sure I'll see her around.

12:41.244 --> 12:42.587
Excuse me.

12:43.577 --> 12:46.271
I couldn't help overhear your
conversation at the bar.

12:46.368 --> 12:47.625
You're friends
with Karen Garner?

12:47.715 --> 12:49.684
Well, more of an
acquaintance, actually.

12:49.828 --> 12:52.683
Brad Jennings, US
Marshals Service.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.824
Is Karen in some kind
of trouble, Deputy?

12:54.921 --> 12:58.675
Karen Garner, also known as Sarah
Atkins, is a wanted fugitive.

12:58.773 --> 12:59.651
I'm trying to locate her.

12:59.728 --> 13:01.211
Sorry, I don't know
how I could help you.

13:01.311 --> 13:03.103
Well, I thought I heard
you say you were neighbors.

13:03.446 --> 13:05.198
Yes, you did.

13:05.413 --> 13:08.263
So maybe you could tell
me where you live, Mr.--

13:08.368 --> 13:10.394
I'm sorry, Deputy, I
prefer not to get involved.

13:10.479 --> 13:11.794
I'm not asking you
to get involved.

13:11.877 --> 13:13.610
I'm just trying to
get your address.

13:14.348 --> 13:16.976
Now, if you prefer, we can do
this down at the field office.

13:17.514 --> 13:18.708
Hello, Harold.

13:19.778 --> 13:21.542
Detective Stills--
Organized Crime.

13:21.691 --> 13:23.766
This guy you're
talking to is my CI.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.119
He's a Confidential Informant?

13:26.255 --> 13:28.372
And money launderer for
the late Don Moretti.

13:30.064 --> 13:31.896
Hey, I've got some
questions for him.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.854
You were risking his cover
by even approaching him.

13:35.525 --> 13:37.313
Let's go.

13:38.639 --> 13:39.981
What did he want?

13:40.797 --> 13:42.425
Just to ask me some questions.

13:42.525 --> 13:45.604
Funny, I've got a few of
those for you too, Harold.

13:53.437 --> 13:55.544
So am I to assume that
you were following me?

13:55.646 --> 13:59.990
I think the bigger question is...
Are you working a case without me?

14:00.111 --> 14:02.320
I feared that, with this case,
you had certain sensitivities.

14:02.443 --> 14:04.075
I thought it best to
let you sit it out.

14:04.190 --> 14:06.296
What kind of sensitivities?

14:07.404 --> 14:13.097
Her name-- or at least her aliases...
Are Karen Garner and Sarah Atkins.

14:13.199 --> 14:15.408
She has outstanding warrants for
identity theft and passing

14:15.508 --> 14:18.039
bad checks, but I don't think
she's a potential perpetrator.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.551
I believe that she's on
the run from someone.

14:20.734 --> 14:21.572
Who?

14:21.666 --> 14:23.578
Likely someone
she was close to.

14:27.053 --> 14:29.592
When I was first building the
machine, I kept seeing the same

14:29.686 --> 14:33.523
numbers come up-- a week,
a month, six months apart.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.241
Usually women.

14:38.492 --> 14:39.748
At first I thought
it was a mistake.

14:39.829 --> 14:42.767
How could anyone's life
be repeatedly threatened?

14:42.899 --> 14:47.127
And then I realized...
They were living with the person

14:47.225 --> 14:49.476
who would eventually kill them.

14:54.947 --> 14:56.640
I've been working to
uncover who she really is.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.648
It might help us
identify the threat.

15:02.748 --> 15:07.236
Send me her address and we'll finish
discussing my sensitivities later.

15:30.327 --> 15:31.851
Hello, Karen.

15:32.218 --> 15:33.906
Or do you prefer Sarah?

15:34.652 --> 15:36.064
Who the hell are you?

15:36.159 --> 15:37.682
Someone who wants to help you.

15:37.778 --> 15:39.135
You a cop?

15:39.255 --> 15:40.768
No.

15:40.935 --> 15:42.929
But I know you're
running from someone.

15:43.044 --> 15:43.844
Who is it?

15:43.941 --> 15:44.687
Boyfriend?

15:44.776 --> 15:46.366
Ex-boyfriend?

15:46.553 --> 15:48.048
Husband?

15:49.292 --> 15:50.364
Husband.

15:50.457 --> 15:52.158
I'm going to ask
you one last time.

15:52.270 --> 15:53.431
Who are you?

15:53.516 --> 15:54.909
My name's John.

15:55.806 --> 15:58.401
And I help people out
of tough situations.

15:58.508 --> 16:00.318
What do you know
about my situation?

16:00.416 --> 16:02.655
I know it was bad enough for
you to leave your home, your

16:02.745 --> 16:07.311
life, everything. And I know you'll
have to keep running, Karen...

16:08.526 --> 16:10.799
If nobody stops him.

16:13.211 --> 16:15.329
It's Sarah.

16:16.632 --> 16:18.296
My name is Sarah.

16:18.406 --> 16:21.124
What if I said you could
stop running, Sarah?

16:21.789 --> 16:24.097
I'd say you don't
know my husband.

16:24.899 --> 16:28.035
Mr. Reese, I traced Karen's
former alias-- Sarah Atkins--

16:28.177 --> 16:30.566
To a Chicago apartment
where she was living.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.949
Building manager said she paid rent
using checks with a different name.

16:34.070 --> 16:35.861
He's sending me
one of them now.

16:36.332 --> 16:37.983
Sarah Jennings.

16:38.983 --> 16:40.802
Jennings-- He's her husband.

16:40.905 --> 16:42.290
He's the Marshal.

16:42.590 --> 16:43.780
How did you know that?

16:43.889 --> 16:45.191
That's not important.

16:45.697 --> 16:47.796
What's important is
we can help you.

16:47.900 --> 16:48.562
We?

16:48.665 --> 16:51.526
I have a colleague who will watch
over you while I take care of things.

16:51.941 --> 16:53.294
We need you to stay here.

16:53.399 --> 16:55.025
What is it you're gonna do?

16:55.739 --> 16:58.876
Make it so you don't
have to be afraid anymore.

17:06.123 --> 17:07.894
That's everything we
have on Peter Arndt.

17:08.003 --> 17:09.230
Thanks.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.963
Did this look like a professional
hit to you, detective?

17:12.067 --> 17:12.917
It's hard to say.

17:13.021 --> 17:15.354
We don't get a lot of contract
killings up this way.

17:15.454 --> 17:18.703
But this guy Arndt owed a lot of
money to some dangerous people.

17:20.746 --> 17:21.951
And this?

17:22.127 --> 17:24.443
Accident report from a car
crash Arndt and his wife were in.

17:24.538 --> 17:25.299
Single car.

17:25.406 --> 17:27.027
Husband swerved
to avoid a deer.

17:27.127 --> 17:28.652
Wife was killed.

17:28.757 --> 17:29.499
It's a hell of a thing.

17:29.634 --> 17:33.011
Guy survives a crash like that only
to get taken out two months later.

17:35.079 --> 17:36.230
I got to take this.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.048
Thank you.

18:48.769 --> 18:50.247
No new messages.

18:50.348 --> 18:52.709
To listen to saved
messages, press 9.

18:52.861 --> 18:54.175
It's me.

18:55.231 --> 18:56.755
Jessica, I mean.

19:02.783 --> 19:05.103
I don't even know if
you check this number.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.721
Um, I need to talk.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.839
Oh, you scared me.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.287
Who are you calling?

19:20.850 --> 19:22.137
Nobody.

19:22.735 --> 19:23.354
That's funny.

19:23.452 --> 19:25.257
It sounded like you
were calling somebody.

19:44.163 --> 19:45.156
Jessica Arndt.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.269
Pretty girl.

19:46.364 --> 19:47.557
Dead on the scene.

19:47.648 --> 19:49.550
Blunt force head injury
from the rollover.

19:49.638 --> 19:51.090
No seat belt.

19:52.752 --> 19:54.850
Do you still have her x-rays?

19:56.259 --> 19:58.116
Uh...

19:58.322 --> 19:59.198
Arndt.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.206
There we go.

20:01.442 --> 20:04.571
In your report, you identified
two previous fractures--

20:04.663 --> 20:06.150
A broken wrist and cracked rib.

20:06.260 --> 20:07.066
Mm-hmm.

20:07.163 --> 20:08.139
May I?

20:13.762 --> 20:15.595
Is that a spiral fracture?

20:15.712 --> 20:17.221
I suppose it is.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.686
She'd get that from
having her wrist twisted--

20:20.791 --> 20:23.555
Hard-- As opposed to
falling on it, right?

20:23.758 --> 20:25.210
- Come here.
- You're hurting me.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.738
One other thing.

20:28.283 --> 20:31.995
You listed her cause of death as...
Blunt force trauma to the head

20:32.116 --> 20:33.654
and a broken neck.

20:33.755 --> 20:34.932
As I said.

20:35.042 --> 20:37.767
Could someone suffer those
kinds of injuries if the car's

20:37.896 --> 20:40.668
front and side air
bags deployed?

20:40.772 --> 20:44.469
Not likely, but a body is, uh,
subjected to extreme forces

20:44.581 --> 20:45.413
in a crash like that.

20:45.496 --> 20:48.532
Is it possible she could have had
these injuries before the accident?

20:48.680 --> 20:49.936
You're hurting my arm.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.258
Get back here!

20:54.692 --> 20:55.307
No, no.

20:55.407 --> 20:56.242
Baby.
Baby.

20:56.332 --> 20:57.670
Jess.

20:57.765 --> 20:58.973
Hey.

21:02.802 --> 21:04.701
Detective, I don't know what
cases you're used to seeing

21:04.793 --> 21:08.800
down in Manhattan, but up here, car
crashes account for most of my business.

21:09.017 --> 21:12.930
Just because something's possible
doesn't mean it's probable.

21:13.819 --> 21:15.214
Excuse me.

21:15.558 --> 21:17.008
Carter.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.625
Detective, I'm heading up to speak
with Arndt's closest family--

21:19.717 --> 21:20.590
His mother-in-law.

21:20.688 --> 21:22.480
See if she knew anything
about his money problems.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.980
Send me the address.
I'll meet you there.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.270
All right.
Will do.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.723
I'm watching Sarah's
apartment and I'm tracking the

21:28.827 --> 21:31.122
GPS on her phone, Mr. Reese.

21:32.092 --> 21:34.915
I've also discovered some new
information about her husband.

21:35.098 --> 21:38.403
According to the Denver Public
Records Database, Jennings was

21:38.544 --> 21:41.930
sued twice for excessive
use of force on the job.

21:42.027 --> 21:44.062
Both cases were dismissed.

21:44.515 --> 21:47.348
He falsified the
warrants on Sarah.

21:47.971 --> 21:50.983
Trumped up the charges to enlist
the entire US Marshal Service

21:51.098 --> 21:52.524
in helping him stalk his wife.

21:52.629 --> 21:54.518
That's why she
can't stop running.

21:54.635 --> 21:57.168
Only one way to deal with guys
like this, guys who hide who

21:57.278 --> 21:59.377
they really are until
they get home.

21:59.726 --> 22:01.225
What will you do, Mr. Reese?

22:01.588 --> 22:04.007
Show 'em what a real
monster looks like.

22:19.263 --> 22:21.372
Detective... uh, what was it?

22:21.477 --> 22:22.388
Stills?

22:22.482 --> 22:24.155
You have a change of heart
about me quest--

22:29.126 --> 22:31.182
Your fellow deputies
know why you're here?

22:32.133 --> 22:34.370
Chasing your terrified wife?

22:35.857 --> 22:39.808
If you come after her again...
I will kill you.

22:39.991 --> 22:42.340
No one will be able to
protect you from me.

22:45.025 --> 22:46.477
Do you understand?

23:06.072 --> 23:08.719
Finch, we're gonna want to
move Sarah to a safer location.

23:08.825 --> 23:09.474
Agreed.

23:09.563 --> 23:11.894
And then maybe you can explain
the wisdom of antagonizing an

23:12.010 --> 23:14.725
entire law enforcement agency.

23:26.648 --> 23:29.121
Mr. Reese, we have a problem.

23:32.806 --> 23:33.901
Hi.

23:34.054 --> 23:35.573
Uh, one way to New Haven, please.

23:35.663 --> 23:37.000
Sure.
Just need photo ID.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.321
Thank you.

23:42.432 --> 23:43.667
Thank you.

23:49.275 --> 23:50.820
Is something wrong?

24:10.697 --> 24:11.970
Stop right there!

24:12.093 --> 24:13.524
Get down on the ground!

24:13.628 --> 24:16.366
Karen Garner, we have a
warrant for your arrest!

24:16.486 --> 24:18.530
Suspect in custody, track 20.

24:20.204 --> 24:20.921
Yes, detective.

24:21.005 --> 24:22.759
I just heard on the radio
your girl got popped.

24:23.043 --> 24:24.463
Down at the train station.

24:24.657 --> 24:26.453
They picked her up
on a Marshal's BOLO.

24:26.554 --> 24:27.328
Where is she now?

24:27.414 --> 24:28.577
Probably still there.

24:28.686 --> 24:30.895
Transit cops will hold her till
the Marshals can pick her up.

24:31.056 --> 24:32.171
Thanks, detective.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.847
Have to get to the
train station.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.779
We're too late.
Jennings already picked her up.

24:45.883 --> 24:48.475
With his cover blown, he can't take
her home through official channels.

24:49.093 --> 24:51.549
He's gonna make her
disappear, Finch.

24:52.777 --> 24:54.399
We need to get to her.

24:56.263 --> 24:57.753
I may have a way.

24:59.318 --> 25:04.357
Government vehicles now have mobile
hotspots for Internet access--

25:04.479 --> 25:05.386
Like this one.

25:05.465 --> 25:06.780
That include Marshal vehicles?

25:06.876 --> 25:07.545
Yes.

25:07.664 --> 25:09.161
So I can get into
their network.

25:09.278 --> 25:12.842
The trick will be figuring out
which vehicle is Jennings'.

25:14.853 --> 25:15.735
That's him.

25:15.823 --> 25:16.846
West Side highway.

25:16.927 --> 25:18.496
He's taking her
out of the city.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.221
Get out.

25:20.337 --> 25:21.785
Excuse me?

25:23.010 --> 25:25.472
Leave the laptop now, Harold.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.342
And get out.

25:50.017 --> 25:52.152
Your daughter was so beautiful.

25:52.415 --> 25:54.027
Oh, thank you.

25:54.549 --> 25:56.023
Were you two close?

25:56.120 --> 25:57.312
Very.

25:57.413 --> 25:59.793
We spoke most every day.

26:00.671 --> 26:03.675
So you said you had some
questions about Peter?

26:03.775 --> 26:04.607
Uh, yes, ma'am.

26:04.713 --> 26:08.213
Uh, prior to his disappearance, were you
aware of your son-in-law's financial

26:08.316 --> 26:09.767
difficulties?

26:10.009 --> 26:11.405
No.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.839
Peter had a good job.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.461
He was a good provider.

26:14.687 --> 26:20.570
Based on our information, he owed more
than $3 million to various entities.

26:23.351 --> 26:27.311
Well, Jessica once mentioned that
they were going through a rough patch.

26:27.483 --> 26:30.139
But that Peter was
turning things around.

26:30.548 --> 26:32.514
That was just before
the accident.

26:32.603 --> 26:34.289
Excuse me.

26:35.995 --> 26:39.755
When you said Jessica told you "they
were going through a rough patch,"

26:39.912 --> 26:42.640
was she talking about
money, or her and Peter?

26:42.738 --> 26:43.284
Oh, no.

26:43.381 --> 26:45.342
Jessica and Peter had
a good marriage.

26:45.441 --> 26:49.397
- I mean, they had problems, like any
married couple, but-- - Detective.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.622
See you a minute?

26:53.404 --> 26:56.196
I just got a call that a guy in
a suit assaulted four deputy

26:56.290 --> 26:58.205
Marshals in their
downtown field office.

26:58.299 --> 26:59.101
Wait.
What?

26:59.222 --> 26:59.817
I know.

26:59.933 --> 27:00.790
I'm heading back down
there to follow up.

27:00.884 --> 27:02.368
Do you mind wrapping
things up with the mother?

27:02.445 --> 27:03.338
It looks like a dead end.

27:03.432 --> 27:04.693
Sure.

27:09.563 --> 27:10.457
Detective Carter.

27:10.543 --> 27:12.813
What's this about an incident
with four deputy Marshals?

27:12.929 --> 27:13.948
I've got it under control.

27:14.031 --> 27:14.711
Are you sure?

27:14.806 --> 27:15.905
'Cause it doesn't
sound like it.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.238
Yes, detective.

27:17.380 --> 27:20.320
So how is your New Rochelle
investigation going?

27:20.423 --> 27:24.479
Donnelly hasn't found anything
so far, but I think I have.

27:24.599 --> 27:25.253
Oh?

27:25.348 --> 27:28.158
Yeah, I think Arndt killed
his wife and covered it up.

27:28.256 --> 27:30.223
The kind of thing you guys
usually intervene in, except

27:30.323 --> 27:32.524
this time your partner
was too late.

27:32.893 --> 27:35.621
Still don't understand
John's connection to this.

27:35.710 --> 27:37.738
Are you sure there isn't
anything you can tell me?

27:37.826 --> 27:39.557
I'm sure you'll make
sense of it, detective.

27:46.172 --> 27:49.479
You were saying something about
problems between Jessica and Peter.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.480
Oh, you know,
just little spats.

27:52.121 --> 27:53.913
Not even worth mentioning.

27:54.676 --> 27:57.924
Do you know if these spats
ever went beyond words?

27:58.882 --> 28:00.303
I'm not sure what you mean.

28:00.408 --> 28:02.198
Did they become physical?

28:03.056 --> 28:05.134
What is it you're suggesting?

28:08.738 --> 28:10.045
Nothing.

28:10.158 --> 28:11.960
Just some routine questions.

28:12.050 --> 28:12.929
I should get going.

28:13.016 --> 28:14.394
I'm sorry for troubling you.

28:14.487 --> 28:18.543
Peter had his faults,
but he loved Jessica.

28:19.019 --> 28:20.635
And she loved him.

28:22.024 --> 28:24.123
I'm sure she did, ma'am.

28:24.298 --> 28:28.655
He was so much better
than her... usual type.

28:33.277 --> 28:35.275
She was seeing
someone before Peter?

28:35.382 --> 28:37.658
She had a fling with a soldier.

28:37.847 --> 28:40.335
Back when she was
living in Tacoma.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.997
This soldier-- Do
you remember his name?

28:43.115 --> 28:44.204
No.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.201
They weren't
together very long.

28:46.886 --> 28:50.288
He was always away on duty,
and then she'd be alone.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.768
That wasn't the life for her.

28:52.872 --> 28:56.006
He told her the same thing--
Told her not to wait for him.

28:59.125 --> 29:03.914
However, sometimes I now wonder...
If she had waited for him,

29:04.021 --> 29:07.580
maybe things could have worked
out, maybe she would be happy.

29:08.291 --> 29:10.456
And we'd talk again.

29:13.908 --> 29:17.138
Can I ask, do you have
any pictures of this man?

29:17.236 --> 29:18.675
I don't.

29:18.762 --> 29:20.818
But I still have some
of Jessica's things.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.950
You're welcome to look
through them if you like.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.572
Sure.

30:18.099 --> 30:19.668
Jessica.

30:20.982 --> 30:21.837
Oh, yeah.

30:21.957 --> 30:23.609
I got engaged.

30:25.877 --> 30:27.415
His name's Peter.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.715
That's one of the things
you learn over there.

30:33.350 --> 30:35.390
In the end, we're all alone.

30:35.839 --> 30:37.958
And no one's
coming to save you.

30:38.372 --> 30:40.029
Be happy with Peter.

30:40.201 --> 30:41.777
You don't believe that?

30:44.656 --> 30:50.585
Tell me to wait for you and...
Say those words and I will.

30:54.618 --> 30:56.914
Hey, cheers.

31:06.046 --> 31:08.353
In the end, we're all alone.

31:09.721 --> 31:11.765
And no one's
coming to save you.

31:13.143 --> 31:14.630
Gene?

31:14.801 --> 31:15.333
Hey.

31:15.433 --> 31:16.303
Joss Carter.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.340
Good.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.076
Listen, I need a favor.

31:19.584 --> 31:21.837
Yeah, personnel file--
First name John.

31:21.956 --> 31:23.095
Special Forces.

31:23.189 --> 31:26.571
Stationed at Fort Lewis between
between June and September of '01.

31:26.666 --> 31:28.183
My eyes only.

31:28.324 --> 31:29.955
Yeah, thanks, Gene.

31:39.069 --> 31:40.105
Mr. Reese.

31:40.210 --> 31:41.120
What is it, Finch?

31:41.212 --> 31:44.215
What exactly is your plan once
you catch up to Deputy Jennings?

31:44.361 --> 31:46.527
To get Sarah away from him.

31:46.714 --> 31:47.880
And Jennings?

31:47.982 --> 31:50.027
Jennings had his chance.

31:50.844 --> 31:52.501
He didn't take it.

31:52.598 --> 31:53.987
I think, under the
circumstances, it might be a

31:54.068 --> 31:56.440
good idea to bring the
police in on this one.

31:56.525 --> 31:58.538
Finch, you hired me to
take care of these things.

31:58.655 --> 32:01.455
You don't like how I do
it, hire someone else.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.889
Mr. Reese?

32:03.999 --> 32:05.501
John?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.604
- Carter.
- Hello, detective.

32:17.703 --> 32:21.949
This New Rochelle business-- The
car accident, the cover up, Jessica.

32:22.101 --> 32:23.855
You knew what I'd
find, didn't you?

32:23.950 --> 32:25.943
Knowing isn't always
a blessing, detective.

32:26.032 --> 32:26.630
True.

32:26.722 --> 32:29.671
But, I confess, I was calling
with a more urgent problem-- John.

32:29.779 --> 32:31.486
Don't tell me
you've lost him again.

32:31.589 --> 32:36.281
No, I know where he is.
I just... can't reach him.

32:37.194 --> 32:39.002
Or stop him.

32:49.881 --> 32:51.631
Why are we here, Brad?

32:53.255 --> 32:55.798
I wanted us to have
some time together, baby.

32:55.966 --> 32:57.462
Just you and me.

32:58.808 --> 33:02.103
I don't know how things got
so out of hand with us.

33:02.436 --> 33:05.276
But, I promise, I'm
going to fix it.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.310
You don't have to run anymore.

33:12.787 --> 33:16.059
You believe me... right?

33:16.358 --> 33:17.525
I do.

33:17.624 --> 33:21.018
I do believe you, I
do believe-- Mmm.

33:27.277 --> 33:30.327
So maybe we can
take these off now?

33:41.559 --> 33:44.132
You never did know
what to say, did you?

34:00.661 --> 34:01.991
I know what you're thinking.

34:02.090 --> 34:03.323
That this is my fault.

34:03.411 --> 34:05.159
That, somehow, I wanted this.

34:05.276 --> 34:09.768
But have you ever considered
how hard this has been for me?

34:09.917 --> 34:11.947
The trouble I've gone
through for you?

34:12.077 --> 34:13.663
What's it gonna take, Sarah?

34:15.989 --> 34:17.755
I love you so much.

34:20.927 --> 34:23.014
But I can't do this anymore.

34:48.658 --> 34:50.172
Go.

34:50.433 --> 34:51.259
Where?

34:51.360 --> 34:52.763
Anywhere you want.

34:53.094 --> 34:54.870
You're free.

34:59.034 --> 35:00.771
Thank you.

35:02.011 --> 35:03.721
Sarah.

35:04.755 --> 35:07.245
She's gone.
It's over.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.027
Something funny?

35:11.128 --> 35:13.885
You've never been
in love, have you?

35:16.597 --> 35:19.421
Really, truly in love?

35:19.519 --> 35:20.640
Why?

35:20.737 --> 35:26.394
Because then you'd know...
It'll never be over.

35:26.860 --> 35:28.587
It is for you.

35:54.431 --> 35:57.910
Your friend told me I
might find you up this way.

35:59.570 --> 36:01.902
I can't let you take him, John.

36:02.008 --> 36:04.482
This can't end
like New Rochelle.

36:06.007 --> 36:07.623
Do I need to look in the trunk?

36:07.717 --> 36:09.967
You can do whatever you like.

36:10.077 --> 36:12.530
It isn't gonna change
what I have to do.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.385
Let me have him, John.

36:15.870 --> 36:17.833
If I do, he'll
get away with it.

36:17.926 --> 36:20.244
I'll see that he doesn't.

36:21.031 --> 36:23.064
It won't be up to you.

36:23.169 --> 36:25.169
That's my point.

36:25.628 --> 36:29.348
There are things you can do,
detective, and things you can't.

36:29.456 --> 36:30.774
And that's where I come in.

36:30.893 --> 36:34.066
I can't allow you to
just execute people.

36:34.153 --> 36:36.044
This isn't on you.

36:36.155 --> 36:37.921
It's on me.

36:39.585 --> 36:41.854
All I'm asking for
is your trust.

36:41.970 --> 36:42.654
What?

36:42.757 --> 36:44.415
For you to do the right thing?

36:44.508 --> 36:46.859
That I'll do what
needs to be done.

37:13.067 --> 37:15.620
Sullivan send you?

37:16.090 --> 37:20.548
This supposed to be some kind of, uh...
Intimidation?

37:21.336 --> 37:23.206
I don't have his money.

37:24.727 --> 37:27.767
You don't have anything I want.

37:28.986 --> 37:31.361
Not anymore.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.820
Who the hell are you?

37:33.921 --> 37:35.962
Good question.

37:37.623 --> 37:41.401
Haven't known the
answer for a long time.

37:42.689 --> 37:45.426
I know who I was.

37:48.154 --> 37:50.956
I was the guy who
left her behind.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.290
You know why?

37:52.388 --> 37:53.538
The real reason?

37:53.637 --> 37:56.731
Because I thought she deserved
someone better than me.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.809
I thought she deserved someone
who would look after her...

38:04.760 --> 38:06.925
Be there for her.

38:08.467 --> 38:11.667
I thought she deserved
someone like you.

38:14.813 --> 38:16.847
So I don't know.

38:17.214 --> 38:19.789
I was hoping you could tell me.

38:19.894 --> 38:21.397
Tell you what?

38:21.525 --> 38:24.233
Who I'm supposed to be now.

38:25.543 --> 38:27.820
Now that she's gone.

38:27.929 --> 38:33.453
See... when you find that one person
who connects you to the world...

38:34.518 --> 38:36.883
You become someone different...

38:37.949 --> 38:41.045
Someone better.

38:42.638 --> 38:45.048
When that person is taken from you...

38:46.943 --> 38:49.110
What do you become then?

39:26.991 --> 39:30.008
I was beginning to wonder when I
was going to hear from you again.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.873
I had some business to
take care of, out of town.

39:32.986 --> 39:37.729
I trust you now fully appreciate why
I couldn't tell you about Sarah's case.

39:38.442 --> 39:42.089
I hope you now understand
why you should have.

39:52.162 --> 39:54.042
Did you know?

39:55.622 --> 39:59.235
Was she one of those numbers
that came up again and again?

40:00.334 --> 40:02.186
What I know, Mr. Reese...

40:02.600 --> 40:03.927
Is that New Rochelle happened

40:04.070 --> 40:06.036
before we started
working together.

40:06.801 --> 40:10.370
And because of that, there was nothing
that either one of us could have done.

40:19.368 --> 40:22.216
Forgot to include that in
your birthday present.

40:22.316 --> 40:23.956

This is warden Gustavo Pena.

I'm calling from
Torreon penitentiary.

41:34.028 --> 41:34.749
Yes?

41:34.850 --> 41:37.645
I have been asked to inform you
we have your fugitive in custody.

My fugitive?

41:38.844 --> 41:40.036
Yes.

41:46.369 --> 41:53.683
Uh, this Marshal-- Just so I'm clear--
Was he tall, dark hair, in a suit?

41:53.774 --> 41:54.492
That's him.

41:54.585 --> 41:57.050
