WEBVTT

00:00.197 --> 00:01.987
Previously on Life Unexpected...

00:01.988 --> 00:04.539
You and someone had a kid.

00:04.540 --> 00:05.609
You gave up that kid.

00:05.610 --> 00:06.855
I am that kid.

00:06.856 --> 00:08.684
And now I'm applying
for emancipation.

00:09.205 --> 00:10.447
Cate Cassidy... that's your mom.

00:10.448 --> 00:11.631
I am Cate Cassidy.

00:11.632 --> 00:13.780
00.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.190
00.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.370
I am not granting
you emancipation.

00:18.371 --> 00:19.467
I'm releasing you

00:19.468 --> 00:22.588
back into their
temporary joint custody.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.375
I needed this.

00:24.972 --> 00:27.274
I see you've met Mr. Daniels.

00:27.275 --> 00:29.623
You're a... teacher.

00:30.795 --> 00:31.848
Eric?

00:31.849 --> 00:34.257
I'm your new tutor.

00:34.733 --> 00:36.155
I love you.

00:37.105 --> 00:37.675
I do,

00:37.676 --> 00:39.307
I want kids... I just...
it's taking me

00:39.308 --> 00:40.539
a little while to come around,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.128
and I don't even know if I can.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.387
Cate, I just want to try.

00:44.388 --> 00:46.581
Let's try.

00:57.763 --> 00:58.967
Good morning, Portland.

00:58.968 --> 01:02.873
Welcome to a morning of
all-music madness on k-100.

01:02.874 --> 01:03.836
Ryan and Kelly'll

01:03.837 --> 01:04.997
be back on Monday.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.863
But today we're
giving away tickets

01:06.864 --> 01:09.799
to the k-100 sugar
magnolia music festival,

01:09.800 --> 01:13.194
happening this weekend,
emceed by your favorite host,

01:13.195 --> 01:15.542
Ryan Thomas, who's hard at work

01:15.543 --> 01:17.706
getting ready for the big event.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.150
Wow.

01:21.151 --> 01:22.414
Yeah, wow.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.912
I could get used to this
trying-for-a-baby thing.

01:27.704 --> 01:28.517
You want to try it again?

01:28.518 --> 01:31.126
Yeah, I may be physically unable.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.781
Yo, Cate, you home?

01:34.782 --> 01:35.661
Oh!

01:35.662 --> 01:37.322
Now I'm physically unable.

01:37.323 --> 01:39.302
He's just here for the tickets.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.229
Meet me in the shower.

01:54.811 --> 01:57.596
Cate? Good morning, good morning,

01:57.597 --> 01:59.837
good morning! Sorry.

01:59.838 --> 02:02.114
I should have sent these
over with Lux last night.

02:02.115 --> 02:05.246
I've just been so busy
organizing the concerts.

02:05.247 --> 02:08.293
No biggie. Okay,
we have tickets, vip passes

02:08.294 --> 02:09.775
that will get you
in the front area.

02:09.776 --> 02:11.035
And thank you for chaperoning.

02:11.036 --> 02:12.563
You are welcome. And, you know,

02:12.564 --> 02:14.994
inherent in that thank you is
that you actually chaperone.

02:14.995 --> 02:16.563
Cate it's a concert...
I don't think

02:16.564 --> 02:18.115
they're gonna get ably just, um,

02:18.116 --> 02:19.407
yoo-hoo!

02:19.408 --> 02:22.129
I can't believe I'm
gonna be a grandma!

02:22.572 --> 02:23.573
Mom...

02:24.800 --> 02:25.531
Mom?

02:25.532 --> 02:26.700
Wh-what,

02:26.701 --> 02:28.930
you're pregnant? No. No.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.150
I just assumed it was
post-wedding weight gain.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.190
Well, they're still just
trying at this point.

02:33.191 --> 02:34.374
But just a little something

02:34.375 --> 02:36.226
to help the process along.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.429
So...

02:37.679 --> 02:38.711
You're trying?

02:38.712 --> 02:40.069
Um, you know,

02:40.070 --> 02:41.156
you guys have the tickets,

02:41.157 --> 02:43.180
so you should probably just, um,

02:43.181 --> 02:44.991
you should go. Where you going?

02:45.940 --> 02:47.241
Fun!

02:47.242 --> 02:48.762
Mm-hmm. Hey, do you
want me to chaperone?

02:48.763 --> 02:50.401
Baze is gonna do it.

02:50.402 --> 02:52.143
Is this edible underwear?

02:53.687 --> 02:55.175
Bye.

02:57.909 --> 02:58.677
Baby...

03:08.871 --> 03:11.213
Hey, uh, Cate gave us
a few extra tickets.

03:11.214 --> 03:12.198
Should we invite boys?

03:12.199 --> 03:15.083
I don't know who to bring,
but maybe you could ask Jones.

03:15.711 --> 03:18.193
Come on, man, you got to
move on and get over bug.

03:18.194 --> 03:20.229
Otherwise, you'll
end up like Baze...

03:20.230 --> 03:21.939
old, alone,

03:21.940 --> 03:23.470
permanently single. What?

03:24.744 --> 03:26.919
First, I am not
permanently single,

03:26.920 --> 03:28.946
and second, Tasha's right...
you can't...

03:29.307 --> 03:31.918
You can't be hung up on
someone who's not an option.

03:31.919 --> 03:33.681
Me? What about you?

03:34.124 --> 03:36.658
Well... who, Cate?

03:36.659 --> 03:38.082
I'm not hung up on Cate.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.425
I mean, I've dated
lots of other women.

03:40.426 --> 03:42.729
Oh, who, like Abby, Cate's sister?

03:42.730 --> 03:44.337
Or trina, Cate's boss.

03:44.338 --> 03:47.126
Or... or Paige,
Cate's sister-in-law.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.597
Yeah, I'm not seeing a
pattern here at all.

03:48.598 --> 03:50.583
That's messed up, man. Hey,

03:50.962 --> 03:53.072
I'm a single dad...
it's hard to meet someone who's

03:53.073 --> 03:54.615
not Cate-related.

03:54.616 --> 03:56.821
But I could have a date
with a non-Cate person

03:56.822 --> 03:58.065
anytime I want.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.073
Prove it. Yeah,
bring somebody to the concert.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.091
I will.

04:02.264 --> 04:03.514
You know what?

04:04.688 --> 04:06.775
Let's all bring dates.

04:06.776 --> 04:08.426
I mean, there's a whole
sea of guys out there.

04:08.427 --> 04:10.184
You just find one you like.

04:11.977 --> 04:14.258
See? This is us

04:14.259 --> 04:15.839
moving forward.

04:18.394 --> 04:20.699
He took that baby thing hard, huh?

04:21.466 --> 04:23.173
You okay with it?

04:23.635 --> 04:24.495
Yeah.

04:26.111 --> 04:28.474
Okay, so, chapter nine,
when Johnny says,

04:28.475 --> 04:30.766
"stay gold, ponyboy,
" what does that mean?

04:30.767 --> 04:34.206
There's a boy who's
gold and half pony?

04:34.207 --> 04:38.558
"All good things must end"?

04:38.559 --> 04:39.894
Sure.

04:41.473 --> 04:43.020
Okay, what's wrong?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.342
You hate this book that much?

04:44.343 --> 04:45.840
No. No, no, no.

04:45.841 --> 04:48.112
It's... it's not that.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.575
I just...

04:52.052 --> 04:55.944
I just found out that Cate's
trying to have a... baby.

04:55.945 --> 04:57.765
Wow, that sucks.

04:58.395 --> 05:00.613
I mean, you just found Cate.

05:00.614 --> 05:01.802
You know, you're probably not

05:01.803 --> 05:03.418
ready to share h in the attic,

05:03.419 --> 05:05.894
even if that someone's
the size of a burrito.

05:09.147 --> 05:11.844
When my parents brought
my baby brother home,

05:11.845 --> 05:13.823
I found this box in the attic,

05:13.824 --> 05:15.738
and I wanted to ship
him to China in it.

05:15.739 --> 05:18.510
How'd that work out? Fantastic...
he lives in Shanghai.

05:18.511 --> 05:20.349
He owns a very
successful noodle shop.

05:20.350 --> 05:21.797
Worked out great for everyone.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.515
You see,
"all good things must end."

05:29.155 --> 05:30.288
Hey, um...

05:31.460 --> 05:34.273
You know that k-100
concert this weekend?

05:34.274 --> 05:37.630
Well, I have these amazing tickets,
and I was thinking

05:37.631 --> 05:40.824
about inviting someone...
like, on a date.

05:40.825 --> 05:43.793
Not that I'm asking
you out on a date...

05:44.495 --> 05:46.362
Lux, I wish I could; I can't.

05:46.363 --> 05:49.759
No, I know you can't with me,
but it's not just me, okay?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.992
There's, like, a thousand
other people and me.

05:51.993 --> 05:53.614
That's... not the...

05:53.615 --> 05:55.242
Well, yeah, it is.

05:55.243 --> 05:56.091
But...

05:56.940 --> 05:58.482
I'm already going.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.483
Well, then we can go together.

06:01.115 --> 06:01.965
Lux.

06:03.349 --> 06:04.700
I've got a date.

06:09.650 --> 06:10.295
Oh.

06:16.683 --> 06:17.588
So, um...

06:17.741 --> 06:20.284
Ryan told you? Yeah, well,
he let it slip, you know?

06:20.285 --> 06:21.824
'Cause he's so excited.

06:22.139 --> 06:24.560
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.

06:25.418 --> 06:26.961
What are you talking about?

06:27.615 --> 06:28.311
Nothing.

06:28.501 --> 06:29.553
Um...

06:30.111 --> 06:32.628
All right... start talking, Cate,

06:32.629 --> 06:35.480
or I'm gonna get the wine
and day-drink it out of you.

06:37.988 --> 06:39.801
You know, Ryan wants
to have a kid,

06:39.802 --> 06:41.176
and...

06:42.608 --> 06:44.548
I just, I don't.

06:44.549 --> 06:46.343
But you're trying.

06:46.344 --> 06:48.027
Yeah. You know, Ryan is.

06:48.028 --> 06:49.494
I'm-I'm still...

06:49.495 --> 06:51.462
Kind of on the pill.

06:51.463 --> 06:52.538
Cate!

06:52.539 --> 06:54.828
Mom, don't yell at me.
He's gonna notice,

06:54.829 --> 06:56.596
don't you think,
when you're not getting pregnant?

06:56.597 --> 06:57.839
Well, you know,
lots of women, they

06:57.840 --> 07:00.286
don't get pregnant.
Into right now.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.483
Okay? Just the sight of a man
and a bottle of two-buck Chuck

07:02.484 --> 07:04.240
and I start ovulating. Mom,

07:04.241 --> 07:05.343
you know what?

07:06.435 --> 07:08.441
Never mind. I-it's a long story.

07:08.442 --> 07:10.242
It's too long to
get into right now.

07:10.243 --> 07:10.921
Um...

07:13.337 --> 07:16.530
Look, Ryan, he just needs
to think that I am trying.

07:16.531 --> 07:18.528
Why? Well, because

07:18.529 --> 07:20.411
if I am not trying, mom...

07:24.448 --> 07:26.945
...You know, he's gonna leave me.

07:26.946 --> 07:27.923
If Ryan finds out

07:27.924 --> 07:30.528
you're lying to him about
something this important,

07:30.745 --> 07:34.336
take my word for it, he's gone.

07:49.375 --> 07:53.893
*

08:06.175 --> 08:07.477
Suzie, right?

08:07.478 --> 08:08.389
Copy girl?

08:08.390 --> 08:11.110
Nate, right? Boss's son?
Yeah, right.

08:11.111 --> 08:13.346
Yeah, it was kind of a
blatant nepotism thing.

08:13.347 --> 08:15.664
I made copies of
your resume. I know.

08:15.665 --> 08:17.056
Ouch. So,

08:17.057 --> 08:19.945
um, I have an extra vip ticket

08:19.946 --> 08:22.634
to that k-100 sugar
magnolia thing tomorrow,

08:22.635 --> 08:24.697
and I wanted to bring a date.

08:24.984 --> 08:26.492
Are you interested?

08:26.493 --> 08:27.805
Seriously?

08:28.405 --> 08:29.338
Yeah.

08:29.856 --> 08:31.321
Nate, a word?

08:32.491 --> 08:34.842
Sorry, I should have asked.

08:34.844 --> 08:36.929
Um, is there an
office dating policy?

08:36.931 --> 08:38.765
I'm going with you
to that concert.

08:39.446 --> 08:41.096
So I guess not. It's...

08:41.097 --> 08:42.600
Not a date.

08:42.601 --> 08:44.543
We're trying to
broaden our clientele,

08:44.544 --> 08:46.654
and we've been going after
recording artists and athletes.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.637
Mia Catalano will
be performing there.

08:48.638 --> 08:50.801
Her producer is Haley Scott,
she's a singer as well,

08:50.802 --> 08:51.671
and she has a husband

08:51.672 --> 08:53.596
in the NBA. Nathan Scott...

08:53.597 --> 08:55.711
he's a point guard
for the bobcats.

08:55.712 --> 08:58.265
Was. He just retired...
he and his wife have

08:58.266 --> 09:00.159
a ton of money just
waiting to be invested

09:00.160 --> 09:01.949
and I want to meet her.
Well, I'll get right on that.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.683
I'm sure that Cate can
scrounge up an extra ticket.

09:03.684 --> 09:05.719
No, I don't need an extra ticket,
I need access.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.555
You have access, and I have you.

09:07.556 --> 09:09.726
So get me backstage,
introduce me to Haley,

09:09.727 --> 09:11.744
and then you go on
your stupid date.

09:13.484 --> 09:14.243
What up,

09:14.244 --> 09:16.920
Portland...?!

09:18.514 --> 09:20.693
I'm Ryan Thomas,
and I'm happy to be your host

09:20.694 --> 09:24.460
for k-100's annual
sugar magnolia fest!

09:24.894 --> 09:27.903
We got a great line-up of
bands for you this afternoon.

09:27.904 --> 09:31.086
The radioactive
armadillos are here!

09:32.440 --> 09:35.220
And we got Ben Lee in the house!

09:37.163 --> 09:38.817
Let's hear it for
our next performer.

09:38.818 --> 09:41.536
She is here all the way
from north Carolina.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.280
Put your hands together
for the one and only...

09:44.281 --> 09:46.974
Mia Catalano.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.699
I- I don't like this.
I don't like this new look.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.225
Paige gave me a makeover.

10:08.226 --> 10:10.905
What? She asked me to.
She looks hot, right?

10:10.906 --> 10:13.577
Well, little dude, you better
keep your hands off of her.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.970
I told you I didn't want a date.

10:24.971 --> 10:27.547
Uh, really? 'Cause your
outfit says you do.

10:27.768 --> 10:29.491
If you didn't get
dressed up for Jones,

10:29.492 --> 10:31.039
then who the hell did
you slut it up for?

10:31.040 --> 10:33.565
I'm gonna call you Slux.
Is that cool? Slux.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.980
I think it has a good ring to it.

10:34.981 --> 10:36.701
Laverne, thank you for
looking after the kiddos.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.777
I got to go check on my boss.
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

10:38.778 --> 10:40.545
What should we do first,
seats or cocktails?

10:40.546 --> 10:41.378
Cocktails.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.579
Oh, p.S.,

10:42.580 --> 10:45.678
meeting your boss does not count
as a non-Cate-related date.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.080
Oh, actually, I have a date.
And she's meeting me here.

10:48.081 --> 10:48.776
So, see?

10:48.777 --> 10:50.665
Success... dates for everybody.

10:52.021 --> 10:52.757
Hell, yeah.

10:52.758 --> 10:54.902
I'm not wearing no
underwear for nothing.

10:54.903 --> 10:56.725
All right, so now all
we got to do is find

10:56.726 --> 10:58.375
someone great for you, too.

11:14.394 --> 11:16.051
She's incredible.

11:16.052 --> 11:18.130
How long have you
been her producer?

11:18.131 --> 11:20.618
Uh, three years. Wow.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.377
Yeah, she was just a...

11:22.378 --> 11:25.157
She was a shy little kid with
a hoodie playing keyboard

11:25.158 --> 11:26.606
when I found her.

11:26.607 --> 11:27.553
I had to really convince her

11:27.554 --> 11:29.542
that she could go solo, you know?

11:40.492 --> 11:42.393
Do you miss it? You know, now that

11:42.394 --> 11:43.923
you're producing and
not the one out there?

11:43.924 --> 11:46.109
Yeah. Sometimes I do.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.269
But there's something
really amazing about

11:48.270 --> 11:50.810
nurturing someone
else's talent, you know?

11:50.811 --> 11:52.799
Call it maternal pride.
I don't know,

11:52.800 --> 11:54.559
I have a seven-year-old,
I think in mommy terms.

11:54.560 --> 11:55.843
You have a seven-year-old? Yeah.

11:56.246 --> 11:58.861
Wow. Eh, I was pregnant the
senior year of high school.

11:58.862 --> 12:02.355
Actually went into labor
during my valedictorian speech.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.741
I was, uh, pregnant, too.

12:06.243 --> 12:08.211
Mm-hmm, valedictorian.

12:08.532 --> 12:10.607
Yeah, knocked up
by the quarterback.

12:10.608 --> 12:12.465
Forward. Nathan.

12:14.503 --> 12:16.251
Nate. If you tell me
you're pregnant with

12:16.252 --> 12:17.219
your second right now, we're

12:17.220 --> 12:18.564
officially in the basketball game

12:18.565 --> 12:19.651
wait... are you pregnant?

12:19.652 --> 12:21.194
Yes. Congratulations.

12:21.195 --> 12:22.034
Thank you.

12:22.035 --> 12:24.221
What about you,
you gonna have any more?

12:25.989 --> 12:27.055
We're trying.

12:27.335 --> 12:30.187
Ah. Well, that's the
fun part, right?

12:34.426 --> 12:35.620
Slow down.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.012
My heels are sinking
into the grass.

12:38.013 --> 12:39.148
Your date can wait.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.691
My date is waiting,
outside the gate. What?

12:41.692 --> 12:43.998
Hey, man, uh,
my name is Nate Bazel.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.225
We have a meeting backstage

12:45.226 --> 12:47.527
with Haley Scott...
that's Mia's producer.

12:50.289 --> 12:51.544
You're not on the list.

12:52.826 --> 12:54.156
You said Cate put us on it.

12:54.342 --> 12:55.485
Uh, she was supposed to.

12:55.486 --> 12:57.383
Are you sure that we're...
you're not on the list.

12:57.384 --> 12:58.893
You're not coming in.

13:00.841 --> 13:02.332
You know what, our mistake
was asking permission.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.324
We don't ask, we take.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.601
Isn't that a little Rambo?

13:05.602 --> 13:07.748
Rambo? That really dates you,
and not in a good way.

13:07.749 --> 13:09.921
Come on, trust me,
there's got to be another way in.

13:24.856 --> 13:25.797
Thank you so much.

13:25.798 --> 13:28.126
And now, for this next song,
I would like

13:28.127 --> 13:30.746
to bring a very special
someone to the stage.

13:30.747 --> 13:33.653
She's one of my favorite
artists of all time...

13:33.654 --> 13:36.330
Haley James Scott, everybody!

13:36.331 --> 13:37.702
Surprise! What? No.

13:37.703 --> 13:38.521
No, yes. No, I'm not.

13:38.522 --> 13:39.585
It was Mia's idea.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.818
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

14:46.591 --> 14:47.683
Hey.

14:47.684 --> 14:48.573
Yay!

14:48.574 --> 14:49.961
You made it!

14:58.383 --> 15:00.338
Uh, Lux, uh,
you've met Eric, right?

15:00.339 --> 15:01.142
Oh.

15:01.143 --> 15:02.668
Mr. Daniels.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.558
I met him at your basketball game.

15:04.559 --> 15:07.578
Yeah. Yeah, we know each other.

15:07.579 --> 15:09.914
Wha...? You guys know each other?

15:09.915 --> 15:11.912
Uh, yeah. Totally.

15:12.466 --> 15:14.569
Paige is my aunt.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.715
Okay, search all of the
bathrooms and trailers...

15:23.716 --> 15:24.786
You know, and anywhere else that

15:24.787 --> 15:26.530
there are groupies of Guadalajara.

15:26.531 --> 15:28.622
Groupies and booze?
You looking for your mom?

15:28.623 --> 15:31.680
No. The radioactive armadillos
are missing an armadillo.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.862
Apparently, his girlfriend
just called him and told him

15:33.863 --> 15:36.007
that she became a
lesbian at lilith fair,

15:36.008 --> 15:37.744
and he went on a bender.
I have to start

15:37.745 --> 15:39.512
calling around looking
for a replacement band.

15:39.513 --> 15:40.869
I'll get your phone.

15:43.696 --> 15:45.300
We should call the
Decemberists' manager.

15:45.301 --> 15:46.624
You know, he might
be able to help us.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.564
Right, yeah, he still owes you,
right, Ryan?

15:58.130 --> 15:59.556
Ryan...

17:00.207 --> 17:02.382
Come on, you love this song.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.521
Ben Lee's great, huh?

17:07.521 --> 17:08.487
Oh, he's awesome.

17:08.488 --> 17:10.156
This whole thing is awesome.

17:10.156 --> 17:11.858
It was awesome of you
and Lux to bring me.

17:12.959 --> 17:14.473
I should probably
stop saying "awesome."

17:19.796 --> 17:21.433
Hey, uh, she and bug were together

17:21.434 --> 17:22.670
for, like, over two years,

17:22.671 --> 17:24.387
so it's just gonna take some time.

17:24.387 --> 17:25.998
You know? Right. Yeah.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.544
Um, hey, I'm gonna
go grab a drink.

17:29.545 --> 17:31.533
You want a soda? Uh, if you

17:31.534 --> 17:34.874
can find a way to make that
soda a beer, then yes, two.

17:37.202 --> 17:38.518
Oh, make it three!

17:45.830 --> 17:47.468
I invited Jones 'cause I
thought you liked him.

17:47.469 --> 17:49.068
You've barely said
two words to the guy.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.476
Well, you're the
one who asked him.

17:50.477 --> 17:51.809
I didn't even want him to come.

17:51.810 --> 17:53.397
Yeah, you're making
that really clear.

17:54.537 --> 17:55.641
Come on, did you see him walk off?

17:55.642 --> 17:57.287
Even his hair looked sad.

17:57.288 --> 17:58.222
Well, where'd he go?

17:58.223 --> 17:59.980
Uh, hopefully, getting us beer.

18:01.286 --> 18:02.470
Oh. Hey, go help him before he

18:02.471 --> 18:04.036
gets thrown inteng for you.

18:04.037 --> 18:04.732
Come on.

18:04.733 --> 18:08.049
Concert jail! You got us
thrown in concert jail!

18:08.050 --> 18:09.316
Man, you know what,
you are straight

18:09.317 --> 18:10.999
out of a scoobveng for you.

18:11.515 --> 18:13.278
You know what, it's not my fault

18:13.279 --> 18:14.612
you don't have the
upper body strength

18:14.613 --> 18:16.497
to get over a measly little fence.

18:16.498 --> 18:17.970
Don't you work out? A few little

18:17.971 --> 18:19.633
bicep curls neveng for you.

18:19.634 --> 18:22.240
We're supposed to be
signing Haley right now.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.798
God, everyone in
here smells like ham.

18:25.817 --> 18:26.425
Hey, hey, you know what?

18:26.426 --> 18:27.538
I don't want to be here, either.

18:27.539 --> 18:30.177
You're the one that
railroaded my weekend, okay?

18:30.178 --> 18:31.696
I was supposed to be
on a date right now,

18:31.697 --> 18:33.776
not in some carny
jail stuck with you.

18:33.777 --> 18:35.766
Excuse me, how long
are we stuck in here?

18:35.767 --> 18:38.390
Till my supervisor comes.
Yeah? When's that gonna be?

18:38.391 --> 18:39.450
Whenever he feels like it.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.800
He loves Ben Lee.

19:04.357 --> 19:05.340
Lux!

19:06.034 --> 19:06.950
Lux.

19:08.775 --> 19:10.463
Hey, I was looking for you.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.548
Listen, I was just
trying to move on.

19:13.549 --> 19:15.017
I was trying to
date someone my age,

19:15.018 --> 19:16.478
and... I had...

19:16.856 --> 19:18.942
No idea that she was your aunt.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.747
So, you and Jones?

19:22.748 --> 19:24.652
You two would be cute
together, you know,

19:24.653 --> 19:26.134
if you'd give him the time of day.

19:26.553 --> 19:28.928
It's not that I don't
like him, just...

19:28.929 --> 19:30.748
He doesn't... he doesn't get me...

19:31.453 --> 19:32.746
Like you do.

19:33.082 --> 19:35.035
You know, the whole
Cate-baby thing,

19:35.036 --> 19:36.502
I didn't even say anything,
and you got it.

19:36.503 --> 19:37.270
Yeah.

19:37.271 --> 19:38.626
'Cause I do.

19:38.627 --> 19:39.408
You know?

19:40.224 --> 19:41.104
I get you.

19:42.713 --> 19:45.964
You know? And I get what you're doing,
even if you don't.

19:45.965 --> 19:48.058
What do you mean, even if I don't?

19:48.707 --> 19:50.253
What... what am I doing?

19:50.254 --> 19:51.864
You're picking the wrong guy.

19:52.352 --> 19:54.335
You did it with bug,
and you're doing it with me.

19:55.866 --> 19:58.040
All right, Oprah. Whatever.

20:00.031 --> 20:00.746
Now, listen...

20:01.985 --> 20:03.668
You're afraid of
people not wanting you,

20:03.669 --> 20:04.784
afraid of people leaving you,

20:04.785 --> 20:06.678
so you pick people who
it'll never work with

20:06.679 --> 20:08.326
so that that's the outcome.

20:08.327 --> 20:10.411
They walk away; That's the cycle.

20:10.412 --> 20:11.422
You play out the very thing

20:11.423 --> 20:13.951
that you don't want to happen
just to prove yourself right.

20:13.952 --> 20:15.978
You know what? Hm?

20:16.944 --> 20:18.451
I was wrong.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.514
You don't get me.

20:23.152 --> 20:24.820
Nobody wants to be
rejected or left behind.

20:24.821 --> 20:26.327
I'm not exactly a special case.

20:26.328 --> 20:27.008
Yeah, you are.

20:29.977 --> 20:32.730
Look, choosing a guy like
Jones is breaking the cycle.

20:33.546 --> 20:34.639
And if you're not choosing him,

20:34.640 --> 20:37.051
that means for some reason
you're not ready to break it.

20:37.052 --> 20:39.625
But if you are, don't pick someone

20:39.626 --> 20:41.500
who doesn't have to reject you.

20:42.723 --> 20:44.300
Give Jones a chance.

20:46.722 --> 20:48.725
Ryan, I am so sorry.

20:48.726 --> 20:50.947
Does the truth ever
occur to you, ever?

20:50.948 --> 20:52.351
I-I don't know

20:52.352 --> 20:54.712
why I don't want to
have a kid, okay?

20:56.522 --> 20:58.451
I don't know, I mean, maybe...

21:00.072 --> 21:01.709
You know, maybe it's because

21:01.710 --> 21:04.149
I feel like a crappy mom already,

21:04.150 --> 21:07.560
or... or maybe it's
because I had a crappy mom

21:08.009 --> 21:09.502
who-who did not offer me

21:09.503 --> 21:12.449
one ounce of support during
the hardest time of my life,

21:12.450 --> 21:14.295
when I was pregnant with Lux.

21:14.989 --> 21:17.885
You know, or-or maybe it's
because I just got Lux back,

21:17.886 --> 21:20.053
or... or because my career is not

21:20.054 --> 21:21.132
where I though you ultimatum

21:21.133 --> 21:23.024
or... you know,
because we've been married

21:23.025 --> 21:24.454
for, like, two seconds.

21:24.455 --> 21:26.171
Maybe I just need some time to

21:26.172 --> 21:27.046
figure it out with

21:27.047 --> 21:29.240
or hounding me or...

21:29.241 --> 21:30.006
All right, all right.

21:30.007 --> 21:31.938
...Like, pressuring me.
All right, Cate!

21:33.626 --> 21:35.394
You take all the time you need.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.314
Figure out whatever it is
you need to figure out.

21:37.315 --> 21:38.624
I'm not... I'm not pressuring you,

21:38.625 --> 21:39.997
I'm not giving you ultimatums

21:39.998 --> 21:41.004
or any of that crap.

21:41.005 --> 21:43.295
I am just trying to
be honest with you.

21:43.825 --> 21:45.208
And the truth is,

21:45.866 --> 21:47.350
if you don't have a
hell of a good reason

21:47.351 --> 21:49.026
for lying about so can't do it.

21:49.027 --> 21:51.347
Then I don't have a reason
to stay in this marriage.

21:52.116 --> 21:55.416
'Cause I cannot be married
to you if I can't trust you.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.136
Just, I can't... I can't do it.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.955
This is fun, hanging out with you.

22:30.970 --> 22:33.071
Well, I'm no Lux.

22:34.102 --> 22:34.859
Tasha...

22:36.238 --> 22:38.321
I-I didn't come for Lux.

22:39.050 --> 22:40.707
I came because you asked me.

22:42.046 --> 22:42.702
What?

22:43.686 --> 22:46.842
Look, I've been waiting around
for Lux for, like, ever.

22:47.930 --> 22:49.455
I said yes to you, because...

22:49.696 --> 22:51.088
I'm tired of waiting.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.159
And because you're cool.

22:54.195 --> 22:55.403
And pretty.

22:57.153 --> 22:57.895
And it's hot

22:58.048 --> 23:00.378
that you could probably
beat me up in a fight.

23:01.788 --> 23:02.925
I could.

23:13.587 --> 23:14.571
Hey, do you know where Eric

23:14.572 --> 23:15.661
is, honey, with

23:20.470 --> 23:21.697
Tasha?

23:39.080 --> 23:41.430
Lux, I'm sorry,
it's not what you think.

23:41.431 --> 23:42.788
I think it's what it looked like.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.274
I invited Jones here
for you, but you

23:44.275 --> 23:46.054
said you didn't ev

23:46.055 --> 23:47.702
you're not even interested.
You don't know

23:47.703 --> 23:49.326
what I am, Tash,
you haven't been here.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.265
You don't know what's
going on with me.

23:51.266 --> 23:53.547
You-you come back
and-and swoop in,

23:53.548 --> 23:54.954
and just because I'm
not all over him,

23:54.955 --> 23:56.810
you take him for yourself?
I didn't take him!

23:56.811 --> 23:57.903
Okay?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.858
He came here for me.

24:00.054 --> 24:01.796
He said that?

24:02.102 --> 24:03.528
Yeah, what,
is it so hard to believe

24:03.529 --> 24:05.399
that he'd be interested in me?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.021
No, I just didn't
expect to see you

24:07.022 --> 24:08.191
sucking on his f

24:08.192 --> 24:09.659
you can't have it all ways.

24:09.660 --> 24:11.654
You can't have
everything and everyone.

24:11.655 --> 24:14.083
What is that supposed to mean?
Look around you,

24:14.084 --> 24:14.744
Lux.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.275
You've got Cate,

24:16.276 --> 24:18.303
you've got Baze, you've got Ryan,

24:18.304 --> 24:19.376
you've got Paige

24:19.377 --> 24:20.722
giving you makeovers,

24:20.723 --> 24:22.621
you've got bug proposing to you,

24:22.622 --> 24:25.024
Jones pining for you,
taking whatever scraps

24:25.025 --> 24:26.223
you bother to throw his way...

24:26.224 --> 24:28.012
Oh, where is this coming from?

24:29.986 --> 24:31.660
We were the same, Lux.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.683
Until your mom,

24:33.870 --> 24:35.883
who never even knew you,
took you back.

24:36.317 --> 24:39.990
My mom, who knew me my whole life,
still didn't want me.

24:40.184 --> 24:41.071
So yeah,

24:41.072 --> 24:43.913
maybe I like Cate
taking care of me

24:43.914 --> 24:45.132
or Baze coaching me

24:45.133 --> 24:47.939
or Jones looking at me
the way he looks at you.

24:48.436 --> 24:49.696
And now what? What?

24:49.697 --> 24:53.128
You're jealous 'cause
Cate's having another baby?

24:55.647 --> 24:58.200
It's a problem I'd kill to have.

25:27.073 --> 25:28.700
Thanks a lot. Look, it's Suzie.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.524
She texted me... she's "lvng."

25:31.295 --> 25:32.691
Loving? Leaving.

25:32.692 --> 25:34.591
She didn't even
bother using vowels.

25:35.442 --> 25:36.275
My condolences.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.668
I know how serious
you were about Suzie,

25:38.864 --> 25:40.905
considering you go all the
way back to yesterday.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.061
Well, I was serious.

25:43.252 --> 25:44.992
Maybe not about Suzie,
but about, you know,

25:44.993 --> 25:46.214
about moving on.

25:46.215 --> 25:47.861
From what?

25:47.862 --> 25:49.440
Random hook-ups?

25:49.441 --> 25:50.674
One-night stands?

25:50.675 --> 25:52.744
From someone I was in love with.

25:53.531 --> 25:55.746
From Cate. I take it

25:55.747 --> 25:57.995
her getting married
wasn't a big deterrent?

25:59.147 --> 26:00.832
Yeah, I thought it was.

26:04.024 --> 26:06.188
Yesterday I found out
that Cate and Ryan

26:06.189 --> 26:08.506
are trying to have a kid together.

26:09.336 --> 26:10.635
And that's kind of like...

26:11.182 --> 26:12.867
It's, like, our thing.

26:13.056 --> 26:14.686
Mine and Cate's.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.280
Am I crazy for thinking
that Cate and I

26:18.281 --> 26:19.834
were meant to be?

26:24.147 --> 26:25.697
I once got involved

26:25.884 --> 26:29.906
with a guy who wasn't
really available,

26:30.248 --> 26:33.187
and I thought if I hung in there
long enough he'd choose me,

26:33.188 --> 26:35.259
that we were meant to be together.

26:35.523 --> 26:37.550
And then one year
turned into two...

26:38.887 --> 26:40.570
Two turned into four...

26:42.298 --> 26:43.513
And where's the guy now?

26:54.085 --> 26:56.785
Moving on is really the
best thing you can do.

26:58.068 --> 27:00.315
Because otherwise,
you will end up...

27:00.532 --> 27:02.930
Stuck in concert jail
with your assistant?

27:03.817 --> 27:05.440
Something like that, mm.

27:08.594 --> 27:11.641
Yes, we have moved up
every band on the line-up.

27:12.759 --> 27:14.215
We just need a closer, okay?

27:15.790 --> 27:17.134
How did you get back here?

27:17.389 --> 27:19.150
Hey! I know that guard.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.927
One night, eight shots.
Long story.

27:22.107 --> 27:23.592
Mm-hmm. Lux isn't
back here, is she?

27:23.593 --> 27:24.545
Did you lose Lux?

27:25.578 --> 27:28.976
I just can't find her.

27:28.977 --> 27:30.104
You know, I texted Baze, so she's

27:30.105 --> 27:31.617
probably with hiars too late.

27:31.618 --> 27:32.988
I have asked you
to do one thing for

27:32.989 --> 27:35.723
me, and you can'ars too late.

27:35.724 --> 27:37.991
Excuse me, I've spent
the entire afternoon

27:37.992 --> 27:39.614
playing baby-sitter to your kid.

27:39.615 --> 27:41.909
Yeah, it's called
being a grandparent!

27:41.910 --> 27:44.006
You know that thing that you
were so excited about that

27:44.007 --> 27:45.360
you couldn't help yourself
and you brought over

27:45.361 --> 27:47.917
an entire gift basket of sex toys?

27:47.918 --> 27:49.545
You know, I can really do
without the tone, Cate.

27:49.546 --> 27:51.089
I mean, I was just
trying to be nice.

27:51.090 --> 27:52.048
Yeah, well, you know something?

27:52.049 --> 27:53.704
It's about 16 years too late.

27:54.654 --> 27:57.049
I'm sorry, but acting
excited about a baby now

27:57.050 --> 27:58.869
does not change the
fact that you...

27:59.422 --> 28:02.102
I mean, you told
me to give up Lux.

28:02.292 --> 28:03.180
What?

28:03.687 --> 28:04.764
Oh, that's great.

28:04.765 --> 28:05.919
Mm-hmm. That's great, Cate.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.644
You got yourself knocked
up in high school.

28:07.645 --> 28:09.285
You didn't want a baby
to ruin your life,

28:09.286 --> 28:10.588
and suddenly it's my fault?

28:10.589 --> 28:13.073
Yeah, it is your fault!
You didn't want Lux

28:13.074 --> 28:15.176
any more than I wanted
you when I got pregnant!

28:22.070 --> 28:24.520
It's nice to finally
hear you admit it.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.745
What is so surprising?

28:26.746 --> 28:28.998
What am I admitting that
is so surprising, Cate?

28:28.999 --> 28:30.098
The truth? That I didn't want

28:30.099 --> 28:31.769
to be a mom at 18?

28:31.949 --> 28:33.777
I didn't want to
skip college, Cate,

28:33.778 --> 28:35.342
and never have a career.

28:35.343 --> 28:36.283
And maybe you're forgetting,

28:36.284 --> 28:38.139
I am not the one who left, Cate.

28:38.140 --> 28:40.759
I stayed. I didn't walk out
when you were six; I was there!

28:40.760 --> 28:43.325
Do you even know why I
agreed to give up Lux?

28:43.520 --> 28:45.527
'Cause I actually wanted
to make something of myself

28:45.528 --> 28:46.706
and be somebody.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.137
I just, I couldn't
stand the thought

28:49.138 --> 28:50.800
of being anything like you.

28:52.987 --> 28:54.338
You know, and that's
probably the reason

28:54.339 --> 28:56.109
that I don't even
want to have kids now.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.504
Because I don't
want to look at them

28:57.505 --> 29:00.225
and blame them for not being
where I want to be in my life,

29:00.226 --> 29:02.475
the way that you have
always blamed me.

29:05.575 --> 29:07.553
Say what you want, Cate. Go ahead.

29:08.237 --> 29:09.062
But I kept you,

29:09.263 --> 29:10.921
and I tried my best.

29:13.759 --> 29:15.990
Which is a hell of a lot
more than you did for Lux.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.006
Cate.

29:32.893 --> 29:35.044
Hey, are you okay? Hey.

29:36.888 --> 29:40.215
My husband hates me, uh,
security is looking for my kid,

29:40.216 --> 29:43.154
and I just had a blow-out
fight with my mom, which...

29:44.057 --> 29:45.663
You know, makes
needing a closing band

29:45.664 --> 29:47.192
sort of pale in comparison.

29:48.276 --> 29:48.818
Sorry.

29:50.829 --> 29:53.131
I mean, no chance you've
got a booze-hound mom

29:53.329 --> 29:54.498
who blames you for ruining

29:54.499 --> 29:56.022
her entire life, too, huh?

29:56.632 --> 29:57.807
No. Oh.

29:58.656 --> 30:00.636
Yeah, my mom passed
away last year.

30:02.114 --> 30:03.568
I hate myself.

30:03.766 --> 30:05.925
No. No, I'm sorry.

30:06.076 --> 30:08.626
What I'm... trying
to say is that, uh,

30:08.627 --> 30:10.188
I understand that
moms can be tricky,

30:10.520 --> 30:12.658
even under the best
of circumstances.

30:13.111 --> 30:16.558
I adored my mom, but, uh,
never quite felt like I could

30:16.559 --> 30:18.025
live up to who she was.

30:21.488 --> 30:25.484
All I really wanted was to
be better than my mom was.

30:27.961 --> 30:30.303
You think maybe that's all
she ever wanted for you, too?

30:31.825 --> 30:33.444
I don't know, I can't, uh...

30:33.445 --> 30:36.615
I can't help you solve
your mom problem.

30:37.458 --> 30:40.552
But... I think I can help you

30:40.553 --> 30:42.017
with your band one.

30:42.618 --> 30:43.555
Thank you for coming,

30:43.556 --> 30:45.228
Portland!

30:45.586 --> 30:48.872
We have a last-minute surprise
guest for you tonight.

30:48.873 --> 30:51.248
Thanks to Haley Scott's
amazing connections

30:51.249 --> 30:54.570
and some, um, well,
some convenient travel plans,

30:54.571 --> 30:56.652
our last artist this evening

30:56.653 --> 30:59.760
is the queen of the
music festival,

30:59.761 --> 31:01.455
and it's a true honor to
have her with us tonight.

31:01.456 --> 31:03.388
So please give a proper

31:03.389 --> 31:05.525
Stumptown welcome

31:05.526 --> 31:06.629
for the one...

31:06.630 --> 31:08.263
The only...

31:08.783 --> 31:10.381
Sarah McLachlan.

32:37.358 --> 32:38.310
I can top that.

32:38.311 --> 32:40.309
I once when on a blind date,

32:40.310 --> 32:43.275
and the guy's hairpiece
fell into the soup,

32:43.276 --> 32:45.856
and then he just kept on
eating like it never happened.

32:45.857 --> 32:48.315
What are you doing dating
guys with hairpieces?

32:48.316 --> 32:50.546
Shut up... you said you
dated a girl who scrapbooked

32:50.547 --> 32:52.598
and made her own pickles, so...

32:52.944 --> 32:56.275
Although, I once dated a guy
who had his own ant farm, so...

32:56.276 --> 32:58.651
Please tell me you did
not spend the night.

32:59.266 --> 33:02.686
Oh! Oh! All right,
I've just lost all respect for you.

33:02.687 --> 33:04.759
Oh, right, like you
had so much before.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.145
I did, actually.

33:06.146 --> 33:07.937
Sure, you are a scary,

33:07.938 --> 33:10.311
micromanaging control freak...

33:12.056 --> 33:12.759
No, that's it,

33:12.760 --> 33:14.650
you're a micromanaging
control freak. Okay.

33:14.651 --> 33:15.449
Okay.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.047
Okay.

33:17.253 --> 33:19.926
Say you could conjure up your
ideal woman from scratch.

33:19.927 --> 33:21.229
Who would she be?

33:21.618 --> 33:23.282
But you know what?

33:23.283 --> 33:25.353
Pint-sized, big eyes,

33:25.354 --> 33:27.121
looks like that
chick from roswell.

33:28.191 --> 33:30.726
Huh. All right, you first.

33:31.039 --> 33:32.335
What's your type?

33:33.561 --> 33:35.861
Sucker for the classics, you know?

33:36.048 --> 33:37.997
Tall, dark and handsome.

33:37.998 --> 33:40.518
Has to have a really
good business sense.

33:40.798 --> 33:42.247
Snore...

33:42.932 --> 33:44.700
And be crazy in bed.

33:45.381 --> 33:47.590
So now... now I'm listening.

33:47.850 --> 33:49.802
Hey, lovebirds,
we're on the last act.

33:49.983 --> 33:52.535
You're free to go... unless
you want to stay the night.

33:54.669 --> 33:57.904
All right, so,
define "crazy in bed."

33:58.211 --> 33:59.563
No. Come on, seriously... because

33:59.564 --> 34:00.725
I think you and I, the two of us,

34:00.726 --> 34:02.445
we'd be highly compatible.
Oh, yeah.

34:02.446 --> 34:04.053
You so wish.

34:29.531 --> 34:31.231
They found her.
We'll bring her here.

34:31.232 --> 34:33.277
She's fine. Oh, thank you.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.702
Lux is okay.

34:50.194 --> 34:51.879
Thank you for finding her.

34:57.871 --> 35:00.710
I remember the day you
told me you were pregnant.

35:02.736 --> 35:05.345
I remember where I was
standing in the kitchen.

35:09.284 --> 35:11.734
I wanted better for you, Cate.

35:13.318 --> 35:15.207
Better than I had.

35:17.189 --> 35:18.721
Better than I was.

35:21.729 --> 35:23.695
And you have it.

35:24.569 --> 35:25.665
Look at you.

35:26.414 --> 35:27.748
You've got a career,

35:27.749 --> 35:29.772
you have a husband who loves you,

35:29.773 --> 35:31.303
you have a daughter...

35:32.149 --> 35:33.443
Who doesn't blame
you nearly as much

35:33.444 --> 35:35.413
as you blame yourself.
Yes, she does.

35:35.642 --> 35:37.005
She blames me.

35:38.181 --> 35:39.408
And why shouldn't she blame me?

35:39.409 --> 35:40.957
I wasn't there.

35:41.933 --> 35:43.865
You know, she had to go
through all those years

35:43.866 --> 35:45.972
and all of those milestones alone.

35:45.973 --> 35:47.191
I mean, and what
am I gonna do now?

35:47.192 --> 35:49.437
I'm gonna go and have some
other kid? Is that what's

35:49.438 --> 35:53.097
stopping you, you don't want
to have a baby in front of Lux?

35:53.374 --> 35:54.960
Cate, you can't keep
beating yourself up

35:54.961 --> 35:56.915
for not being there.

35:58.784 --> 36:02.276
All you can do is take the
second chance to be there now.

36:05.187 --> 36:06.483
She'll be okay...

36:08.153 --> 36:09.761
As long as she knows that
you'll still be there

36:09.762 --> 36:11.256
when she needs you.

36:12.292 --> 36:15.696
As long as you'll just...
be her mom now.

36:24.675 --> 36:25.455
Cate?

36:27.630 --> 36:28.165
Lux.

36:28.635 --> 36:30.914
Me and Tash got in a fight.

37:15.899 --> 37:17.093
Lux asleep?

37:22.161 --> 37:24.005
I don't know what to do, Cate.

37:26.119 --> 37:26.919
This isn't...

37:27.638 --> 37:29.342
This isn't how I wanted us to be.

37:31.545 --> 37:34.449
Well, I figured out why I
didn't want to have a baby.

37:36.384 --> 37:40.101
I just... I felt too guilty
doing it in front of Lux.

37:41.244 --> 37:43.421
You know, and I've just
been feeling really caught,

37:43.422 --> 37:45.348
like, I am gonna be this bad mom,

37:45.349 --> 37:47.809
or I'm gonna be this
bad wife, and...

37:50.039 --> 37:50.993
You know, I've just been feeling

37:50.994 --> 37:52.450
like I'm gonna let her, which...

37:52.451 --> 37:54.215
And I have had to choose,
and I-I guess

37:54.216 --> 37:56.348
I've been choosing her, which...

37:57.461 --> 37:59.307
I know is not fair to you.

38:09.935 --> 38:11.407
I'm gonna talk to her.

38:12.847 --> 38:14.350
Don't do it for me.

38:15.027 --> 38:17.830
Not... not just for you.

38:20.824 --> 38:22.567
I'll do it for us.

38:40.543 --> 38:42.372
Hi. Hi!

38:45.075 --> 38:46.354
Pancakes?

38:46.355 --> 38:49.155
Mm-hmm. Who are you,
and what have you done with Cate?

38:49.156 --> 38:50.234
Yeah, well, you know,

38:50.235 --> 38:52.637
I... never got to do it
when you were little,

38:52.638 --> 38:55.990
and I figured it's never
too late to start now.

38:55.991 --> 38:58.107
I'm sensing some baby guilt.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.898
I'm really sorry about
the way you found out.

39:02.258 --> 39:04.856
Mm, your mom's
x-rated gift basket?

39:07.264 --> 39:08.993
You know, the last
thing I would ever want

39:08.994 --> 39:10.932
is for you to feel replaced.

39:11.589 --> 39:13.946
No. I-I don't.

39:14.739 --> 39:16.545
Not by you, at least.

39:18.015 --> 39:20.234
Mm. By who, Jones and Tasha?

39:22.702 --> 39:24.126
She was right.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.652
I was being selfish...

39:27.299 --> 39:29.328
With her, with Jones...

39:29.679 --> 39:31.429
Probably you, too.

39:32.032 --> 39:33.443
Look, I know the whole world

39:33.444 --> 39:34.605
doesn't revolve around me

39:34.606 --> 39:38.089
and not everyone is always
gonna be there... okay, wait.

39:38.301 --> 39:39.639
I'm not Jones, okay?

39:40.318 --> 39:41.742
I'm always gonna be there,

39:41.743 --> 39:44.638
always, no matter how many
babies come into the picture...

39:44.639 --> 39:47.614
and trust me, I am not
anticipating that many.

39:49.638 --> 39:52.138
No one will ever
replace you to me.

39:54.753 --> 39:56.354
You know that, right?

39:58.118 --> 39:59.515
I do now.

40:03.223 --> 40:03.828
But...

40:05.204 --> 40:08.030
There is someone who doesn't.

40:20.347 --> 40:21.609
Hey. Hey!

40:23.899 --> 40:25.205
That was a great concert.

40:25.709 --> 40:27.031
Lux survived it.

40:27.285 --> 40:28.992
Yeah, there were just,
you know, a few issues,

40:28.993 --> 40:31.573
but... no one ruffied
her soda, so...

40:31.781 --> 40:33.097
You know, all is good.

40:35.383 --> 40:36.499
You want? Ah.

40:37.935 --> 40:38.976
And...

40:40.634 --> 40:41.904
I-I just wanted to talk to you

40:41.905 --> 40:43.550
about this whole baby thing.

40:45.226 --> 40:47.964
I just want you to know
that nothing is gonna change

40:47.965 --> 40:49.260
between you and me.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.744
Or with Lux.

40:56.199 --> 40:58.645
I think that it already has.

40:58.930 --> 41:00.843
But maybe that is a good thing.

41:03.432 --> 41:04.202
I, um...

41:05.819 --> 41:07.862
I felt something yesterday.

41:09.755 --> 41:13.713
That spark that I
haven't felt since...

41:17.528 --> 41:19.316
You know, just
hearing that you and

41:19.317 --> 41:20.374
Ryan are trying Mr. Daniels.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.365
And knowing that you've
already moved on, just...

41:23.371 --> 41:25.466
I think it helped
me out a lot, too.

41:29.683 --> 41:30.755
To moving on.

41:33.410 --> 41:34.534
To moving on.
