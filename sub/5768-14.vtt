WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:04.260
DAVID:
...$13.2 million
from last quarter

00:04.300 --> 00:06.632
and an additional 36.1.

00:06.670 --> 00:10.458
The Chumhum retainer
of $54.6 million,

00:10.510 --> 00:14.731
no risk collar, minus
the $12.2 million payout,

00:14.780 --> 00:18.546
we are now
completely debt free.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.741
What a difference
a month makes.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.048
(David laughing)

00:24.090 --> 00:26.081
Now, expected revenues.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.624
Given the $54.6 million,

00:29.660 --> 00:33.152
the $42.6 million
from Mr. Bishop,

00:33.200 --> 00:37.227
and the strangely
profitable Mr. Sweeney,

00:37.270 --> 00:40.364
at $45.3 million,

00:40.400 --> 00:43.130
we are on track
to end the year...

00:43.170 --> 00:46.435
$133 million in the black.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.731
(applause)

00:47.780 --> 00:50.101
$133 million?

00:50.150 --> 00:52.345
Yes, it was our best
quarter ever.

00:52.380 --> 00:54.519
We were _so worried about
reducmg overhead,

00:54.550 --> 00:58.088
we suddenly made ourselves very,
very profitable.

01:00.420 --> 01:03.480
We held together
through thick and thin.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.782
Now it's time
to celebrate the thick.

01:05.830 --> 01:07.821
(cheers, excited chatter)

01:11.830 --> 01:14.560
What about those new guys?

01:14.600 --> 01:15.669
What about
the new partners,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.258
these five new guys?

01:17.310 --> 01:19.403
DAVID:
_Five offers were
given to assocrates

01:19.440 --> 01:22.238
in order to inflate our ranks.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.272
It is our feeling that
that move was premature.

01:25.310 --> 01:29.280
Just to be clear,
we already made those offers.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.153
We have talked
to the five associates involved.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.384
Well, that was before
we had money.

01:33.420 --> 01:34.250
DAVID:
Have those five
assocnates

01:34.290 --> 01:36.224
submitted their capital
contribution?

01:36.260 --> 01:39.388
No, but they are in the process.

01:39.430 --> 01:43.594
Unfortunately, we all voted
on this at our last meeting.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.495
Well, I say
let's vote again, hmm?

01:48.340 --> 01:49.898
to these guys who did nothing.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.773
All those in favor of delaying
partnership offers,

01:52.810 --> 01:54.368
please raise
your hands.

01:55.540 --> 01:58.304
Yes, that's right, keep
them up, keep them up.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.442
WILL:
You're not hearing us.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.368
We're not going
over $800,000.

02:01.420 --> 02:02.580
(applause in other room)

02:02.620 --> 02:03.882
Our client did
nothing wrong,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.717
his product is
perfectly safe.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.412
Your client misused his product.

02:08.460 --> 02:10.587
No, my client lost her
16-year-old granddaughter.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.190
And if you want to try to win
your case by blaming her...

02:13.230 --> 02:14.595
then I'd love to see you try.

02:14.630 --> 02:15.824
We'll see you in court.

02:18.230 --> 02:20.198
(door opening)
We have a good case.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.389
He has nothing but emotion.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.634
We'll win
In court.

02:22.670 --> 02:25.366
It's the jury system,
it's a flip of the coin.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.900
I don't like
flips of the coin.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.828
It's either that
or pay $14 million.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.769
Times seven. There are seven
other deaths out there.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.516
(sighs)

02:33.550 --> 02:34.744
I want certainty.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.179
What kind of certainty?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.815
A war game.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.522
We're going to be rich, Alicia.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.221
No...

02:44.260 --> 02:46.694
(chuckling):
Yes, we are.

02:46.730 --> 02:50.496
Profit participants in the firm
just came into Chumhum.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.589
Look, once you start getting
yacht brochures in the mail,

02:52.640 --> 02:54.392
that's when you know
you're coming into money.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.567
(laughing):
How do they even know
to send that to you?

02:58.510 --> 03:00.432
(laughing)

03:00.480 --> 03:01.936
Cary, Alicia,
do you have a minute?

03:01.980 --> 03:03.504
Yeah, sure, what's wrong?

03:03.550 --> 03:05.370
_ WILL:
Nothing. We have
something to discuss.

03:05.410 --> 03:09.688
Do you know the, um,
Thief drink case?

03:09.720 --> 03:11.381
The power drink? Yeah.

03:11.420 --> 03:13.615
Well, Thief Corporation
is being sued

03:13.660 --> 03:15.616
by the grandparents

03:15.660 --> 03:17.480
of a young girl who died
after drinking it.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.952
Yeah, we know.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.628
We can't get the defendant
to accept a fair offer.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.695
They want to
go to court.

03:21.730 --> 03:23.789
Now, we want to go to
court, too, but the client

03:23.830 --> 03:24.728
wants to test-run
the case first.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.533
They have given us
$100,000 to run this case

03:26.570 --> 03:28.959
through a mock trial.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.900
So, you want us
to second chair it?

03:30.940 --> 03:32.976
No, we want you
to play Red Team.

03:34.310 --> 03:36.505
You want us to oppose you?
WILL:
Yes.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.541
Represent that plaintiff.
We'll represent Thief.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.013
The Thief CEO wants to
see how the case goes

03:40.050 --> 03:41.415
before he pulls the
trigger on a real trial.

03:41.450 --> 03:44.283
That sounds... fun.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.309
It could be.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.578
Here are the
case files.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.281
From this moment on,
we won't discuss the case.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.821
You prepare, we prepare,

03:49.860 --> 03:52.829
and we'll see how it goes
in mock trial tomorrow.

03:52.860 --> 03:53.929
What about our witnesses?

03:53.960 --> 03:56.690
Here's a list of the expert
witnesses we passed on.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.459
You can hire one of them.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.469
And you can hire an actor
to play the plaintiff.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.707
So, how easy
should we go on you?

04:03.740 --> 04:05.731
Well, this doesn't work
unless you give it your all.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.829
The client will know
if you're going at half-speed,

04:07.880 --> 04:09.370
so come at us hard.

04:09.410 --> 04:11.469
Okay. Be prepared to lose.

04:11.510 --> 04:12.579
(laughing)

04:12.620 --> 04:14.611
WILL:
We'll see you in court.

04:18.820 --> 04:22.017
They've been preparing their
case for three months now,

04:22.060 --> 04:24.949
and we have, what, 24 hours?
Yeah, that's fair.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.958
So, that leaves us
the element of surprise.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.558
Have you ever played
your boss in tennis?

04:29.730 --> 04:33.029
Whatever they say,
they don't want to lose.

04:34.070 --> 04:37.836
The difference is,
we're partners.

04:37.870 --> 04:40.270
They're not our bosses anymore.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.072
So, the Red Team.

04:43.110 --> 04:44.907
We're having team
T-shirts made up.
Kalinda,

04:44.950 --> 04:46.975
what do you have on prior cases
brought against Thief?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.510
We can't find anything
in the database.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.017
Yeah, that makes sense.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.347
Can you look?

04:52.660 --> 04:53.718
What do you mean, no?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.819
Well, you represent
the plaintiff.

04:55.860 --> 04:56.929
You don't work for the firm.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.552
Oh, come on.
(incredulous laugh)

04:58.590 --> 04:59.989
Is this from Will?

05:00.030 --> 05:02.498
Well, Lockhart/Gardner
is the Blue Team,

05:02.530 --> 05:04.623
and I work
for Lockhart/Gardner.

05:04.670 --> 05:05.762
Sorry.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.893
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.568
We'll hire you.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.736
With what?

05:11.770 --> 05:14.500
We have a budget of $10,000
to hire expert witnesses.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.349
Okay... (drums ﬁngers)

05:16.380 --> 05:17.699
$400 an hour.

05:17.750 --> 05:18.899
Oh, come on.

05:18.950 --> 05:20.349
How much for friends?

05:20.380 --> 05:21.870
$400 an hour.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.014
(Alicia and Cary sigh)

05:25.050 --> 05:26.119
We need her.

05:26.150 --> 05:28.357
We'll go
for the cheapest expert.

05:28.390 --> 05:30.654
Okay.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.396
Let us know
when you exceed 20 hours.

05:32.430 --> 05:33.954
Okay.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.956
Good doing business
with you two.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.627
ELSBETH:
Mr. Gold.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.069
Hello.
How are you?

05:39.100 --> 05:40.397
Fine. How are you?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.691
I'm good.
Thanks for asking.

05:41.740 --> 05:42.866
Uh, this way.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.401
I showed them into
the conference room.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.670
Two very nice men from
the Department of Justice.

05:47.710 --> 05:49.940
I know lots of campaign
managers who offer discounts

05:49.980 --> 05:51.106
for their services.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.879
Even the prosecutor,
Wendy Scott-Carr, did.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.717
Oh, yes,
she's been replaced.
What?

05:54.750 --> 05:56.069
She's not on
the case anymore.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.917
I think they realized
"unclean hands."

05:57.950 --> 05:59.611
Okay, they're in here.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.681
Okay, let's see.

06:05.730 --> 06:08.824
Could you try the ones
on that side?

06:08.860 --> 06:10.566
Okay.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.568
(door opens)
Ah, we thought we'd lost you.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.488
ELSBETH (laughs awkwardly):
It's a jungle out here.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.600
This is my client, Eli Gold,

06:17.640 --> 06:19.972
and this is Josh Perrotti.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.875
Hello.

06:21.910 --> 06:23.844
And you remember
Agent LaGuardia?

06:23.880 --> 06:26.747
Of course. Mr. Gold and I shared
our love for the ivories.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.111
The accordion.

06:29.150 --> 06:30.242
The accordion?

06:30.290 --> 06:31.382
I play the accordion.
PERRO'I'I'I: I didn't know that.

06:31.420 --> 06:34.719
Since when?
Six months. Polka
runs in the family.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.182
"Polka runs in the family."

06:36.220 --> 06:38.529
That's funny.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.118
Now, I've asked Eli
not to say anything,

06:40.160 --> 06:42.151
so he's not being rude here,

06:42.200 --> 06:44.998
he's just following
my directive.
PERRO'I'I'I: Good.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.793
I've been sent up from DC.
for one reason:

06:46.840 --> 06:48.865
seems I'm the only man
in Chicago without bias.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.607
Oh. (awkward laugh)

06:51.640 --> 06:54.734
I believe in laying out
our evidence. So, David...

06:54.780 --> 06:57.078
This is a wiretap
from September 28 of last year.

06:57.110 --> 06:58.600
MAN:
So, how much
are we talking, Eli?

06:58.650 --> 06:59.742
ELI:
Uh, the usual this month.

06:59.780 --> 07:02.010
And, uh, if I'm effective,
next month we can discuss.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.449
Did you get my e-mail?

07:03.490 --> 07:05.446
MAN:
I did. I'm talking
to her tomorrow.

07:05.490 --> 07:06.616
She's really your ex-wife?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.185
Oh, this is Greg Leshoure,
of Wooster-Graff Industries.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.824
ELI:
She'll make a great senator.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.498
She just needs a bit
of financial boost.

07:12.530 --> 07:15.829
Unfortunately, that's you
committing a felony, Mr. Gold.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.088
Dollars for donations.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.666
We do have an offer for you.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.634
Eli wears a wire and gets
Peter Florrick admitting

07:20.670 --> 07:22.035
to a recent
accepted bribe...

07:22.070 --> 07:23.207
He never accepted a bribe.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.935
...and we drop all charges
against you.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.608
Go to hell.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.631
Okay, we don't need to go down
the tough-boy route.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.908
We just wanted to lay out
our evidence

07:29.950 --> 07:31.099
and show you all our moves.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.640
It's most welcome.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.749
And I'm sure you wouldn't mind
sending me a copy

07:33.780 --> 07:35.247
of the Wiretap Complaint
Application

07:35.280 --> 07:38.545
for Interception
of Telephonic Communications:

07:38.590 --> 07:41.559
18 USC.2518.

07:41.590 --> 07:43.182
I'll send it right over.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.185
MC:
Good morning.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.549
Thank you for participating in

07:45.590 --> 07:46.522
T&R Legal Research's mock trial.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.551
You're our jury.
Welcome.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.261
The issues here are real.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.860
The lawyers are real.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.265
The judges rulings are real.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.790
Even the room is real,

07:55.840 --> 07:57.262
and, of course, you are real.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.505
So, I'm sure you've noticed
the cameras over your head

07:59.540 --> 08:01.531
and placed strategically
throughout this courtroom.

08:01.580 --> 08:02.979
Just ignore them.

08:03.010 --> 08:05.808
(over speaker):
They are recording your
responses for later analysis.

08:05.850 --> 08:08.114
And, uh,
we'll be checking in with you

08:08.150 --> 08:10.084
now and then to get a sense
of how the trial is going.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.509
Okay. So, without further ado,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.289
I won't tell you anything
about the case.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.083
I will leave that to them.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.280
(bangs gavel)

08:17.330 --> 08:19.218
Plaintiff's lavwers ready
for their opening statements?

08:19.260 --> 08:20.227
Yes, Your Honor.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.852
(bangs gavel)
Let's go.

08:21.900 --> 08:26.189
This is the drink
that killed our client.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.289
It's called Thief.

08:28.340 --> 08:31.537
It contains 240 milligrams
of caffeine.

08:31.570 --> 08:33.879
That is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

08:33.910 --> 08:38.108
It also contains
200 milligrams of guarana,

08:38.150 --> 08:41.039
one of the highest caffeine
containing plants

08:41.080 --> 08:43.583
in the world.

08:43.620 --> 08:47.283
Now, you may have seen this
drink on the store shelves.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.049
You may not have bought it,

08:49.090 --> 08:52.082
because this is how
it's advertised.

08:52.130 --> 08:54.155
(gentle music plays)
MAN (on video):
This is your brain on reality.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.668
(explosion)

08:56.700 --> 08:58.122
(fast rock music plays)

08:58.170 --> 09:00.730
This is your brain on Thief.

09:05.270 --> 09:06.635
It's advertised to kids.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.571
This is the kid who Thief
advertised to.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.613
Bella Ward.
They're in
take-no-prisoners mode

09:13.650 --> 09:15.049
16 years old.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.718
She died last year.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.684
She suffered from a massive
seizure, caffeine tOXICIty.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.756
Where did they get
those pictures?

09:20.790 --> 09:21.882
Facebook.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.581
ALICIA:
Now, I know the opposition here.

09:23.630 --> 09:27.327
I know Will Gardner.
He's a good lawyer.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.055
(chuckles):
Yes, he is.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.728
And I know what he's going
to tell you.

09:31.770 --> 09:34.238
He is going to blame the victim.

09:34.270 --> 09:37.159
He is going to say
that this 16-year-old

09:37.210 --> 09:38.632
should've known better.

09:38.670 --> 09:41.275
That Bella caused her own death.

09:41.310 --> 09:44.143
Then, he's going to blame
the grandparents.

09:44.180 --> 09:47.047
It's unclear how both principles
could be true,

09:47.080 --> 09:51.210
but all he has to do is tarnish
one of them to make it work.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.284
So...

09:54.320 --> 09:57.756
I ask one thing of you:

09:57.790 --> 09:59.951
don't be fooled.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.299
You wouldn't let
a crime victim be blamed.

10:03.330 --> 10:06.299
Bella, in many ways,
is a crime victim.

10:06.330 --> 10:08.696
The only difference here
is the assailant,

10:08.740 --> 10:11.265
and the assailant here is Thief.

10:12.740 --> 10:13.729
They advertised
their drink to her,

10:13.780 --> 10:14.769
and then they killed her.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.779
They need to be held accountable

10:17.810 --> 10:20.210
or they will do the same
to your kids.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.343
Thank you.
(sighs)

10:22.380 --> 10:23.916
Nice work.
Thank you.

10:23.950 --> 10:25.838
Well, that's an odd experience.

10:25.890 --> 10:29.314
Someone making me the subject
of their opening argument.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.918
(chuckles)

10:38.830 --> 10:41.037
Game on.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.106
(footsteps approaching)

10:44.140 --> 10:46.062
ALICIA:
David, how are you?

10:46.110 --> 10:47.668
I'm good.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.200
Unfortunately,
we have a problem.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.401
Oh, no, we have an opportunity.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.372
Ha! That's right.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.445
Every problem is an opportunity.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.209
Well, here's the opportunity:

10:57.250 --> 10:59.684
we need to delay
your partnership for a year.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.881
(chuckles)

11:01.920 --> 11:03.228
The equity
partners are not

11:03.260 --> 11:04.852
withdrawing the offer
of partnership,

11:04.890 --> 11:06.187
we just have to delay it.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.128
Why?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.196
We... need time to assess
the repercussmns

11:14.240 --> 11:16.128
of changes in the workplace.

11:16.170 --> 11:19.003
And how long will that take?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.439
How long will it take

11:20.480 --> 11:22.368
to assess the changes?
We're not sure.

11:22.410 --> 11:25.299
The equity partners will review
at the next meeting.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.874
Thanks for understanding.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.717
David?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.412
What just happened?

11:32.450 --> 11:33.485
Nothing.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.182
We're a democratic institution,
and unfortunately,

11:36.220 --> 11:39.678
democratic institutions
change their minds.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.497
What was that?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.338
I think I was just mugged.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.248
CARY: Could you give us
an example of how you'd do it?

12:10.290 --> 12:11.780
MAN:
Yes, but it's not...

12:11.830 --> 12:14.958
Those proportions would
suggest your conclusion.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.456
So in your expert opinion,

12:16.500 --> 12:17.296
Dr. Borgnine, how did Bella die?

12:17.330 --> 12:20.128
A seizure due
to caffeine tOXICIty

12:20.170 --> 12:21.762
which_caused her
to aspirate eme5is

12:21.800 --> 12:23.108
into her lungs.

12:23.140 --> 12:24.835
In simpler terms?

12:24.870 --> 12:26.064
She choked on
her own vomit.

12:26.110 --> 12:28.237
And this was caused
by this drink?
Yes.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.838
I know it look innocuous,
but it's not.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.279
It killed her.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.540
Thank you, Doctor.

12:33.580 --> 12:34.911
Your witness.

12:34.950 --> 12:38.317
Uh, this is Bella,

12:38.350 --> 12:40.318
the 16-year-old who died,

12:40.360 --> 12:43.386
but this is Bella, too,

12:43.430 --> 12:46.922
in a photo we weren't aware
of until the plaintiff

12:46.960 --> 12:48.291
presented it in
court this morning.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.264
Doctor, can you tell
the difference

12:50.300 --> 12:51.995
between these two...
Objection, Your Honor.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.998
Vague.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.531
Yeah, um... I'll allow.

12:56.570 --> 12:59.334
Could I have
a ruling on that?

12:59.370 --> 13:00.576
I already ruled.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.204
No, I'm sorry,
Your Honor, you didn't.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.445
Overruled.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.516
Go ahead and answer.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.882
Do I see a difference
between these two photos?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.945
Well, in that one
she looks thinner.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.014
Uh, yes,

13:13.060 --> 13:16.416
at her death she weighed
85 pounds, five-foot-six.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.223
Does this suggest
she was anorexic?

13:18.260 --> 13:19.249
Yes.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.520
Those proportions would
suggest your conclusion.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.925
And has anorexia

13:22.970 --> 13:25.427
ever resulted in a seizure?

13:25.470 --> 13:26.835
Yes.

13:26.870 --> 13:29.031
So is there any way
to categorically

13:29.070 --> 13:31.937
blame Thief for
Bella's seizure?

13:31.970 --> 13:35.076
No, not if the victim
had contributory causes.

13:35.110 --> 13:37.203
WOMAN (over recording):
I-I tried to wake her up,

13:37.250 --> 13:40.469
but she was just lying there

13:40.520 --> 13:43.239
so helpless, so tired.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.179
(crying):
Bella,

13:46.220 --> 13:50.429
if I could just hold you
one more time.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.620
WOMAN 2:
I could do that.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.127
No problem.
You sure?

13:53.160 --> 13:54.457
We don't want her
to be too maudlin.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.922
No, I don't do maudlin.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.029
You saw my notices.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.560
Okay.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.398
Is this under
SAG or AFTRA?

14:01.440 --> 14:02.998
CARY:
Actor's Equity, okay?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.166
Cary?

14:05.640 --> 14:08.507
Did David Lee talk to you?

14:10.510 --> 14:13.445
Yeah. Did he talk to you?

14:13.480 --> 14:16.369
(door closes)

14:16.420 --> 14:18.388
He said they were delaying
my partnership.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.354
They say until next year, but...

14:20.390 --> 14:22.085
Same with me.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.553
And the other
fourth years?

14:23.590 --> 14:25.626
My guess is the same.

14:25.660 --> 14:26.957
It's because of money, isn't it?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.092
They don't want
to share the wealth.

14:28.130 --> 14:30.098
They were fine sharing
the debts,

14:30.130 --> 14:31.392
but never the wealth.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.465
What do you want to do?

14:32.500 --> 14:35.060
What do you want
to do?

14:35.100 --> 14:36.465
I think we should get
the fourth years together

14:36.500 --> 14:38.365
and discuss our options.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.129
Partners might be unhappy
with that.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.148
I know.

14:48.050 --> 14:50.280
(knocking)
JORDAN: Eli?

14:50.320 --> 14:51.639
There's a weird lady here
to see you.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.157
Elsbeth, come on in.

14:53.190 --> 14:54.612
We have debate
negotiations with Maddie.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.013
I think I better take them.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.357
No, we'll need
to delay them.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.381
This is our second delay.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.920
Hel_lo.
Hi.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.257
Delay them an hour.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.427
Okay. Nice meeting you.

15:04.470 --> 15:07.462
And you. An exciting office.

15:09.340 --> 15:12.434
So, they sent over the wiretap
complaint application,

15:12.470 --> 15:14.108
but it checked out.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.973
So I asked them to send over
the underlying notes

15:17.010 --> 15:19.706
used to prep the judge,
but that checked out also.

15:19.750 --> 15:23.083
So I... Can I set this here?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.314
Yes, please.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.409
So?
Well,

15:26.450 --> 15:30.454
then I asked them to send over
the evidentiary notes.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.583
Those are proofs
used to show the judge

15:32.630 --> 15:35.292
there was enough reason
to wiretap,

15:35.330 --> 15:37.662
and look here.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.668
What is it?

15:39.700 --> 15:42.032
The Department of Justice
requires three dirty calls

15:42.070 --> 15:43.503
to warrant a wiretap.

15:43.540 --> 15:44.461
"Dirty calls"?

15:44.510 --> 15:46.432
You talking
on an already existing wiretap.

15:46.470 --> 15:48.028
That's a dirty call,

15:48.080 --> 15:49.502
and look here.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.644
Two dirty calls.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.409
They changed it

15:53.450 --> 15:55.668
when they took it to the judge.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.085
See?

15:57.120 --> 16:00.009
Two here, two, three.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.152
Yes.

16:01.190 --> 16:02.418
But this is the primary source,

16:02.460 --> 16:03.449
the one that says two.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.026
It trumps
all the other sources.

16:05.060 --> 16:08.188
So they didn't have enough calls
to warrant the wiretap.

16:08.230 --> 16:09.993
Yes, which means
we can get it thrown out.

16:10.030 --> 16:13.033
Elsbeth, you...

16:13.070 --> 16:15.538
always bring cheer to my office.

16:15.570 --> 16:17.606
Oh, that's sweet.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.733
(crying)

16:19.770 --> 16:22.375
CARY:
And Bella was
your only grandchild?

16:22.410 --> 16:24.378
I'm sorry.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.742
I-I miss her so much.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.543
Yes.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.286
She's my only one.

16:30.320 --> 16:34.484
My-my heart is missing a piece
of itself.

16:34.520 --> 16:38.058
I cry into the night,

16:38.090 --> 16:39.489
"Where are you, my Bella?

16:39.530 --> 16:42.749
"Oh, Lord, why?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.496
Why is she gone from my arms?"

16:45.530 --> 16:47.566
I see, I see.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.467
And you were the one
who discovered her body?

16:50.510 --> 16:51.761
Yes.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.573
It was me.

16:53.610 --> 16:54.770
I held her close to me,

16:54.810 --> 16:56.607
so close,

16:56.640 --> 16:58.107
and she felt cold.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.277
Cold as the grave.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.049
Cold as the night.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.638
Please, baby,

17:03.690 --> 17:06.181
please don't go.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.518
Please, Lord,
don't take her.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.256
(sobbing)

17:11.290 --> 17:14.396
Oh, sweet Heavenly Father!

17:14.430 --> 17:15.692
(sobbing)

17:15.730 --> 17:17.163
ELSBETH:_
Thank you for seeing me.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.259
I just wanted to bring

17:19.300 --> 17:21.063
one small thing
to your attention,

17:21.100 --> 17:22.237
if you have some time.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.103
I always have time
for you, Elsbeth.

17:25.140 --> 17:27.074
Oh, would you
like a biscotti?

17:27.110 --> 17:28.407
Why, yes, I would.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.078
I love biscotti.

17:30.110 --> 17:31.407
Uh...

17:31.450 --> 17:33.839
Thank you.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.144
Here's the problem
for you, Josh.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.546
The number of dirty calls.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.411
You need...
do you remember how many?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.621
Three.
Right,
for an application,

17:43.660 --> 17:46.652
and yet, look here.

17:48.830 --> 17:50.297
Two...

17:50.330 --> 17:52.195
on David LaGuardia's
eVIdentiary notes, see?

17:52.230 --> 17:53.436
Could I see that?

17:53.470 --> 17:56.234
Yes.

18:01.810 --> 18:04.199
Mr. Perrotti, that...

18:04.250 --> 18:05.808
You can't do that.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.249
I did it.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.419
It was a mistake, that's all.
I corrected it.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.145
Yes, but I...

18:11.190 --> 18:13.385
That was just a copy.

18:13.420 --> 18:16.617
Yes, could you bring me
the other copies you have?

18:16.660 --> 18:18.480
(chuckles)

18:18.530 --> 18:19.883
Are you serious?

18:19.930 --> 18:22.251
I needed three dirty calls
for a wiretap.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.791
I got a wiretap, so I must have
had three dirty calls.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.491
Well, I'll bring
my copy to court.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.498
That'll be proof enough.
Uh, no.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.202
Because...

18:31.240 --> 18:35.802
Here is the original,

18:35.840 --> 18:38.547
and just change the two

18:38.580 --> 18:39.842
to three.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.512
Wow.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.484
Yeah.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.688
I'll beat you,

18:50.730 --> 18:52.686
Mr. Perrotti.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.755
No, there's no record
of me doing it.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.199
It's over.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.323
I'm a lot like you,
Elsbeth, but I'm sitting

18:58.370 --> 18:59.667
on this side of the desk.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.238
Not this time.

19:03.270 --> 19:04.931
(chuckles)

19:04.970 --> 19:06.733
You're great.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.238
I hope you'll have dinner
with me when this is over.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.545
Yeah, I'm gonna go now.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.942
Find a way to beat you.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.787
HOWARD:
Do you have any more witnesses?

19:19.820 --> 19:20.855
ALICIA:
Yes, Your Honor.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.654
We call Arthur Schumacher,
Thief VP of marketing.

19:23.690 --> 19:25.658
DIANE:
Uh, Your Honor, objection.

19:25.690 --> 19:29.490
This name was not _
on the plaintiff's Witness list.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.327
It was on the defendant's
witness list, Your Honor.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.894
We're calling him
as a hostile witness.

19:32.930 --> 19:33.931
Is he here anyway?

19:33.970 --> 19:34.937
Yes, I believe

19:34.970 --> 19:36.369
he's in the observation room.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.799
Mr. Schumacher,

19:37.840 --> 19:39.262
are you here?

19:39.310 --> 19:42.404
Can we move this along, please?

19:42.440 --> 19:43.907
What is this, Mr. Schumacher?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.508
Thief Light.

19:45.550 --> 19:46.903
And "light" as in...

19:46.950 --> 19:48.679
no calories?

19:48.720 --> 19:51.280
Well, zero carbs and zero sugar.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.947
So it's advertised
as a diet drink?

19:52.990 --> 19:55.550
No, as a low-cal
energy supplement.

19:55.590 --> 19:58.684
And have you seen
this Web site before?

19:58.730 --> 20:00.698
You see that there,
"Gorgeously Thin"?

20:00.730 --> 20:02.857
Yes, I've heard of it.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.959
It's a pro-ana Web site,
isn't it?
DIANE: Objection.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.262
Relevance?

20:06.300 --> 20:07.392
Yeah, I-I don't get it.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.566
What is that?
Pro-ana?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.966
It's a site intended
to promote anoreXIa.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.831
All right, go ahead.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.836
Do you see this posting?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.541
"So I weighed myself,
and I'm down

20:17.580 --> 20:20.515
"1.5 pounds. Yay.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.347
"Have lots of energy, too.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.348
Trying new power drink,
Thief Light."

20:24.390 --> 20:26.312
Signed, "Girl-in-jeans45."

20:26.350 --> 20:28.557
Yeah, I can see it.

20:28.590 --> 20:31.627
Tell me what a cyber shill is,
Mr. Schumacher.

20:31.660 --> 20:32.729
Damn it.

20:32.760 --> 20:33.897
SCHUMACHER:
It's perfectly legal.

20:33.930 --> 20:35.022
ALICIA:
Yes, I know.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.891
But what is a cyber shill?

20:36.930 --> 20:39.467
A freelance worker
who helps promote products

20:39.500 --> 20:42.469
by posting laudatory comments
on Web sites.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.865
Thank you.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.504
We were able to trace
this laudatory--

20:46.540 --> 20:48.474
good word-- posting

20:48.510 --> 20:51.479
through its IP address
to your cyber shill.

20:51.510 --> 20:54.047
Is Girl-in-jeans45
one of your freelance workers?

20:54.080 --> 20:56.344
Well, just to be clear,
she posts

20:56.380 --> 20:58.985
on hundreds of sites.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.614
Um, we're not targeting,
what is, pro-ana sites.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.809
And do you know

21:02.860 --> 21:06.557
how many time Girl-in-jeans45
posted on Gorgeously Thin?

21:06.590 --> 21:09.559
Well, as I just said, right,
she's a freelance worker.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.864
I don't control her.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.390
135 times,

21:13.440 --> 21:14.793
most of the time
promoting Thief Light.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.592
SCHUMACHER:
Yeah, that's not illegal.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.461
ALICIA:
Yes, but it's also true that
you're targeting anorexics.

21:19.510 --> 21:20.772
No, dieters.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.630
And if Thief
is targeting dieters,

21:22.680 --> 21:23.977
or anorexics,

21:24.010 --> 21:26.478
then it doesn't matter
that Bella was anorexic.

21:26.510 --> 21:28.717
Thief is just as liable
for Bella's death.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.581
Objection.
Counselor is testifying.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.780
No further questions,
Your Honor.

21:31.820 --> 21:32.946
MC:
All right,

21:32.990 --> 21:35.584
as I promised, I'll be checking
in with you now and then.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.656
So if I could just see
by show of hands,

21:37.690 --> 21:39.328
who do we think
is winning right now?

21:39.360 --> 21:40.691
The lawyers representing
the girl who died?

21:40.730 --> 21:42.550
Okay.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.625
What I can't understand
is how you could be losing.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.023
It's the plaintiff's case.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.765
We haven't presented
our defense.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.461
This is what you should expect.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.865
No, it's not what I expect.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.003
I expect you to use
every second to defend...

21:53.040 --> 21:54.803
MC:
...damages that
we might award? Yeah.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.400
What would I give the girl's
family at this point?

21:57.450 --> 22:01.477
I don't know,
maybe $45 million.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.919
MC:
Okay, I see a lot
of heads nodding.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.315
How many agree with that?

22:05.850 --> 22:07.954
Are you losing this
on purpose?

22:07.990 --> 22:09.685
What? _
Do you want me to negotiate?

22:09.720 --> 22:11.358
It'll save you time
in court.

22:11.390 --> 22:13.620
Sir, give us a chance
to present our case,

22:13.660 --> 22:14.991
and don't judge until
you hear it all.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.488
They had the element
of surprise.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.905
Now it's our turn.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.698
(muffled voices talking)

22:31.750 --> 22:33.103
GRACE:
Can you tell what
they're talking about?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.845
Something about work.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.575
Is she getting fired?

22:36.620 --> 22:37.439
No.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.912
Here, go get something
from the fridge.

22:38.950 --> 22:40.918
Figure it out.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.450
CARY:
It's about money.

22:42.490 --> 22:43.718
It's always about money
with them.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.489
I worked for 30
hours on Bishop.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.952
We're the ones
doing all the work.
Look, they said

22:46.990 --> 22:48.821
they're just delaying our
partnerships, all right?

22:48.860 --> 22:50.122
They're not gonna go back
on their word. I say we just

22:50.160 --> 22:51.195
sit tight and wait
and see what happens.
We're doing the work,

22:51.230 --> 22:52.060
they're getting the bonuses.
No, that doesn't make

22:52.100 --> 22:54.398
any sense.
_ CAR_Y: _
Wait, wait, wait.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.759
They're making this
about class warfare.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.767
So what do we do?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.598
STACIE:
Strike.
JOHN:
How about a slow down?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.176
No, that would just hurt
the clients, not them.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.939
CARY:
All right.
This is what I say we do:

23:02.980 --> 23:04.641
_this week we meet
With all our top clients.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.648
Arrange lunches,
drinks, meetings.

23:06.680 --> 23:07.772
To do what?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.014
To scare the partners.
CARY:
Right.

23:09.050 --> 23:09.846
But don't say anything

23:09.880 --> 23:12.019
to the partners
about these meetings.

23:12.050 --> 23:13.779
They'll hear about it
from our top clients anyway.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.014
And what do we do
at these meetings?

23:15.060 --> 23:15.810
Meet.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.885
Don't talk about
forming a new firm,

23:17.930 --> 23:19.557
don't talk about
jumping ship,

23:19.590 --> 23:21.023
just ask them
if they're happy.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.027
That's all.
We can't be accused

23:22.060 --> 23:23.596
of doing anything wrong.

23:23.630 --> 23:25.518
We're just seeing if
our clients are happy.
Right.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.834
But it will scare the hell
out of the partners.

23:27.870 --> 23:29.428
It'll make them think
we're jumping ship

23:29.470 --> 23:31.768
and taking all our
top clients with us.

23:31.810 --> 23:32.765
So what was that about?

23:32.810 --> 23:34.038
You guys
are quitting?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.900
No. Plotting.

23:35.940 --> 23:36.804
Why?

23:36.840 --> 23:38.740
Because we want
attention from our bosses.

23:38.780 --> 23:39.849
Why?

23:39.880 --> 23:40.915
Because they're taking
us for granted,

23:40.950 --> 23:41.974
and we want them not to.

23:42.020 --> 23:44.580
Just don't get
fired, okay, Mom?

23:44.620 --> 23:46.941
Okay.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.787
We should do
it, Alicia.

23:48.820 --> 23:50.629
Start our own firm.

23:50.660 --> 23:51.922
Cary.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.222
What?

23:53.260 --> 23:55.125
You bring Bishop,
I bring Chumhum.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.957
Suddenly we're the eighth
largest firm in Chicago.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.662
You don't think those
two would come with us?

23:59.700 --> 24:01.167
No, actually,
I do think they would.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.565
Then let's do it.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.931
We say yes tonight,

24:03.970 --> 24:05.198
next week we're the
eighth largest firm.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.764
And you're the wife
of the governor.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.573
And money?

24:08.610 --> 24:10.942
You need start-up
money, or...

24:10.980 --> 24:12.777
those clients don't
even con5ider coming.

24:15.050 --> 24:16.210
What did you
have to borrow

24:16.250 --> 24:17.979
to get your capital
contribution together?

24:18.020 --> 24:19.044
A few hundred
thousand?

24:19.090 --> 24:20.955
Put that together, that's
a million between us,

24:20.990 --> 24:21.957
that's start-up money.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.218
Come on.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.683
I'm sick of waiting
on other people.

24:25.730 --> 24:26.958
Having them control
our fates.

24:26.990 --> 24:28.196
It's no better
on our own.

24:28.230 --> 24:30.152
I mean, you're still
controlled by the landlord,

24:30.200 --> 24:31.963
the clients.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.558
Look at Will and Diane,
they're not free.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.635
They're freer
than us.

24:34.670 --> 24:37.639
Waiting to see if we have
to kiss partnership butt

24:37.670 --> 24:39.228
for the next four
years? Come on.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.703
Florrick, Agos
& Associates.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.672
(laughs)

24:42.710 --> 24:45.178
Look at that, I just
gave you first billing.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.678
I'll think about it.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.545
We can change
the world.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.591
DIANE:
As the general counsel

25:02.630 --> 25:03.995
of Thief,

25:04.030 --> 25:05.964
could you tell us how this
beverage came to market?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.729
Thief has gone through

25:07.770 --> 25:09.738
the most intensive, two-year

25:09.770 --> 25:12.000
FDA process
of approval.

25:12.040 --> 25:12.563
DIANE:
And do you believe
that Thief is safe?

25:12.610 --> 25:13.679
Oh, it's more than safe.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.234
It has adhered to the highest
standards of safety.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.577
DIANE:
Thank you.

25:16.610 --> 25:17.747
No further questions.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.805
Mr. Jaffer.

25:19.850 --> 25:22.717
You spoke of the FDA's
approval process.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.945
Was the approval of Thief
as a food,

25:24.990 --> 25:26.617
or as a dietary supplement?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.311
I don't understand.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.851
Did the FDA apply their
food standards to Thief?

25:30.890 --> 25:33.324
Oh. I see.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.759
No.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.621
No, they, uh, considered it
a supplement.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.865
I see. So there were no
standards for Thief to meet.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.663
The FDA applies
standards to food.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.133
Well, uh...
It doesn't apply
it to supplements,

25:43.170 --> 25:44.637
is that
correct?
More or less.

25:44.670 --> 25:45.739
In what way less?

25:46.770 --> 25:47.907
Excuse me?

25:47.940 --> 25:48.907
You just said,

25:48.940 --> 25:50.805
"more or less."
In what way

25:50.850 --> 25:51.942
was I less right?

25:51.980 --> 25:54.175
JAFFER:
Um... I'm sorry.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.619
You're actually right.

25:55.650 --> 25:57.049
Um... it was
a figure of speech.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.581
Okay.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.759
So now according
to your own records,

26:00.790 --> 26:02.314
you submitted Thief
to the FDA more than once

26:02.360 --> 26:04.328
over this two-year
process.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.918
Why did you
submit it twice?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.154
That's not unusual.
Yes, but

26:07.190 --> 26:08.691
the first time you submitted it
as a food.

26:08.730 --> 26:09.822
Is that correct?

26:09.860 --> 26:11.760
Yes.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.132
Then you added one ingredient
to the beverage?

26:14.170 --> 26:15.262
Didn't you?

26:15.300 --> 26:16.995
Here's the list

26:17.040 --> 26:19.759
of ingredients both times
you submitted.

26:19.810 --> 26:21.072
You see that there?

26:21.110 --> 26:22.702
Um...
(clears throat)

26:22.740 --> 26:24.241
Yeah. Okay.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.747
I see.
Looks like, uh...

26:25.780 --> 26:27.145
like B12.
CARY:
That's correct.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.239
And once you added B12,

26:29.280 --> 26:30.372
that allowed you to claim

26:30.420 --> 26:32.012
the beverage was
a dietary supplement

26:32.050 --> 26:34.951
and therefore not subject
to stringent FDA approval.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.810
I would reject that
characterization of our motives.

26:36.860 --> 26:37.884
In fact, isn't
Thief identical to

26:37.930 --> 26:40.125
Rockstar, an energy drink
which recently was sent

26:40.160 --> 26:41.696
an FDA warning letter
for adding ginkgo?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.698
I don't know anything
about that.

26:43.730 --> 26:45.618
And the only reason you weren't
sent an identical warning letter

26:45.670 --> 26:46.864
is because you
gamed the system,

26:46.900 --> 26:48.834
so you are not
considered a food.
Objection,
Your Honor.

26:48.870 --> 26:50.064
Prejudicial.
How is_ that
prejudICIal?

26:50.100 --> 26:51.863
Because you're suggesting
that Thief should

26:51.910 --> 26:53.263
be judged as a food when
it's not a food.
Yes, because

26:53.310 --> 26:55.039
they gamed
the system.
WILL:
No. It's about

26:55.080 --> 26:57.275
categories.
The FDA has concluded

26:57.310 --> 26:58.709
Thief is
not a food.
Wait a minute.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.968
The FDA didn't conclude
any such thing.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.874
Your Honor, which counsel
is questioning?
Wait, wait,
hold it.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.115
Quiet, please.

27:05.150 --> 27:06.378
Um...

27:06.420 --> 27:08.058
I'm gonna side with
the defense on this.

27:08.090 --> 27:09.751
What?

27:09.790 --> 27:10.859
I said I'm gonna side
with the defense on this,

27:10.890 --> 27:12.858
because your argument
is prejudicial.

27:12.890 --> 27:13.925
It is not.
Will you
sit down?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.291
I said his argument
is prejudicial.

27:15.330 --> 27:16.422
There is nothing
prejudicial

27:16.460 --> 27:17.791
about pointing out

27:17.830 --> 27:19.718
the hypocrisy of
an FDA manipulation.

27:19.770 --> 27:20.737
(banging)

27:20.770 --> 27:22.067
Quiet, the two of you.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.761
Keep yelling like this,

27:23.810 --> 27:25.209
you're going to find
yourselves in contempt.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.309
ALICIA:
What, and end up

27:26.340 --> 27:28.069
in mock court jail?

27:29.710 --> 27:30.802
I need a bathroom break.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.772
Then we'll settle this.

27:35.950 --> 27:37.042
Watch it, you two.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.889
Or what?

27:38.920 --> 27:40.751
We don't get partnership?

27:45.860 --> 27:47.953
Wait.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.297
I had nothing to do
with that decision.

27:49.330 --> 27:50.297
_I wasn't even
in the meeting.

27:50.330 --> 27:51.888
Good to know.
Alicia.

27:51.930 --> 27:54.160
You think the name partners
control everything?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.361
We're as much subject
to the equity partners

27:56.400 --> 27:57.708
as you and Cary.

27:57.740 --> 27:59.332
They can outvote us.

28:01.340 --> 28:02.432
ELI:
Jordan!

28:03.480 --> 28:04.777
Hey, you need
my help?

28:04.810 --> 28:06.038
What did you do?
What is this?

28:06.080 --> 28:08.378
I have no idea.
You need to be more specific.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.069
You agreed to
a town hall with Maddie.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.087
You negotiated!

28:11.120 --> 28:12.246
Yeah, I told you.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.053
We delayed twice already;
we couldn't delay any more.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.978
I said wait!
Yes, but I said
we couldn't.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.184
You're challenging me?

28:19.230 --> 28:21.221
I'm trying to run
a campaign.

28:22.430 --> 28:24.421
Eli...

28:25.300 --> 28:27.063
You have been
too distracted.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.499
I have to make decisions.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.292
You're number two.

28:30.340 --> 28:31.466
No.Not"

28:31.510 --> 28:32.807
not anymore.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.899
Nora, get Peter
on the phone!

28:34.940 --> 28:36.237
That's right, Eli.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.874
You call him, but...

28:38.910 --> 28:40.241
here's what's gonna happen.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.942
It's gonna take him ten
minutes to get back to you.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.845
Then 20 minutes.
Then a day.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.289
He's in a meeting,
he's in with the press,

28:46.320 --> 28:47.287
he's busy...

28:47.320 --> 28:48.810
He won't confront you.

28:48.860 --> 28:52.318
But... you will know
what it means.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.248
Peter doesn't need you anymore.

28:56.330 --> 28:57.490
NORA:
Peter's in a meeting, Eli.

28:57.530 --> 28:58.997
He'll have to
call back.

29:12.980 --> 29:14.971
(beeps)

29:20.150 --> 29:23.517
Elsbeth, let's talk to them
about making a deal.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.527
What happened?

29:24.560 --> 29:25.527
_ DAVID:
I just got a call

29:25.560 --> 29:28.154
from Brewer McGower
at Chumhum.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.451
Cary asked him
out to lunch.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.468
Why?

29:31.500 --> 29:32.899
To see if Chumhum
is happy.

29:32.930 --> 29:34.466
They're jumping ship.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.865
WILL: _
No. They're wanting us

29:35.900 --> 29:37.162
to think they're jumping ship.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.906
Well, they're doing
a good job, because

29:38.940 --> 29:41.477
I just called our other
high-profile clients.

29:41.510 --> 29:44.502
A|i_cia was out to lunch
With Sweeney's man,

29:44.550 --> 29:46.108
Beth and John
with Bishop's.

29:46.150 --> 29:47.401
HOWARD:
What the hell?

29:47.450 --> 29:48.849
It's all the fourth years.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.541
Everyone who had their
partnerships delayed.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.514
That's Why they're playing
hardball in mock court.

29:52.550 --> 29:54.256
They're putting on a
good show for Thief.

29:54.290 --> 29:56.485
They want Thief
as a client, too?

29:56.520 --> 29:58.124
Look, I think they're pissed.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.980
Like I would be,
like any of us would be,

30:00.030 --> 30:01.395
and they're just rubbing
our faces in it.

30:01.430 --> 30:02.454
What do we do, then?

30:02.500 --> 30:03.455
Give them their partnerships.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.024
DAVID:
No, we don't negotiate

30:05.070 --> 30:06.025
with terrorists.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.025
And this is _
corporate terrorism.

30:07.070 --> 30:09.038
Then we split them up.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.094
How?

30:10.140 --> 30:11.539
Offer one of
them partnership.

30:11.570 --> 30:13.208
Oh, come on...
You can afford one.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.037
They're too monolithic
right now.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.536
They're united as fourth years.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.241
Create division between them,

30:18.280 --> 30:19.838
and their threat dissipates.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.211
Okay.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.548
We'll need to call a vote
of equ partners.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.582
So which one?

30:28.120 --> 30:30.588
Which one do_ we offer
partnership to?

30:32.360 --> 30:34.191
LUNT:
I feel terrible

30:34.230 --> 30:37.324
about this young girl Bella.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.328
IfI could do anything
to bring her back, I would.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.463
Thank you, Mr. Lunt.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.933
No further
questions.

30:42.970 --> 30:44.107
ALICIA:
Actually...

30:44.140 --> 30:46.438
we have a few questions,
too, Mr. Lunt.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.074
Of course.

30:48.110 --> 30:49.236
My apologies.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.544
You did everything you could
to ensure the safety of Thief,

30:51.580 --> 30:53.400
didn't you?
I did.
I think any

30:53.450 --> 30:55.042
fair analysis would find
that to be true.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.411
How many children
do you have, Mr. Lunt?

30:56.450 --> 30:57.644
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

30:57.680 --> 30:59.944
ALICIA:
Mr. Gardner asked his witness

30:59.990 --> 31:02.049
many biographical
details.

31:02.090 --> 31:03.580
I'm just filling out
the biography.

31:03.620 --> 31:04.621
I'll allow.

31:06.330 --> 31:07.524
I have one daughter.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.527
ALIC_IA:
Her name is Karen,
isn't it?

31:08.560 --> 31:09.925
She's 13 years old?

31:09.960 --> 31:11.461
Yes.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.127
Do you let Karen
drink Thief?

31:13.170 --> 31:14.637
Watch yourself, lady.

31:14.670 --> 31:17.093
Excuse me?
You don't bring
my daughter into this.

31:17.140 --> 31:18.437
Objection, Your Honor.
Again, relevance!
ALICIA:
Your Honor,

31:18.470 --> 31:20.108
the Witness must
answer the question.
This line of questioning...

31:20.140 --> 31:21.232
Your Honor, this is
absolutely relevant.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.202
Excuse me! This is nothing like
a real court experience.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.140
Because you are not addressing
me as the plaintiff.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.647
The only reason you know
his daughter's name is because

31:26.680 --> 31:28.614
he's our client.
That would happen
in court, Mr. Gardner.

31:28.650 --> 31:29.719
He would be goaded
into telling...
HOWARD: That's enough!

31:29.750 --> 31:31.479
(banging gavel)
Let's have
a little quiet, please.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.879
Oh, I have to go
to the bathroom.

31:53.570 --> 31:54.605
You got
a problem,

31:54.640 --> 31:56.676
you bring it to me.
You don't take it to court.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.041
What? I'm a lawyer.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.104
You asked us.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.401
We asked you to take
this seriously.

32:00.450 --> 32:02.042
I am taking this seriously.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.672
You're losing us a client.
That's not my fault.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.210
It damn well is your fault!

32:05.250 --> 32:06.649
Well, then, take us off of it!
Fire us! Get rid of us!

32:06.690 --> 32:08.715
Oh, that's What you want, huh?
That's What these meetings

32:08.760 --> 32:09.556
with clients... is that
what this is about?

32:09.590 --> 32:10.352
Oh, my God.
Listen to yourself, Will.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.153
_ You are not the
injured party, here.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.920
What, and
you are?
I am, yes!

32:20.730 --> 32:22.937
Mm.

32:26.510 --> 32:27.534
Oh, damn it.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.231
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

32:34.180 --> 32:36.239
What are you thinking?
You don't do that.

32:38.350 --> 32:39.544
What's wrong with you?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.455
Oh, my God.

32:43.490 --> 32:44.957
Come on.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.549
(elevator bell dings)

32:50.330 --> 32:52.321
Oh... idiot.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.230
I will wear a Wire.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.704
But I won't get you Peter.
I can't get you Peter.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.173
Oh... that's What I need.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.474
Eli can get you
Jordan Karahalios.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.511
Who's that? The number two?

33:11.550 --> 33:13.438
Why do I want the number two?

33:13.490 --> 33:15.355
He's handling
the campaign finances.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.051
You get him, you get everything.

33:17.090 --> 33:18.352
I have one caveat.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.358
I only deal with you.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.096
If it gets out that I'm doing
this, I'll be murdered.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.519
Not murder-murdered.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.162
Career murdered.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.192
Okay, you get me something real,

33:29.240 --> 33:32.767
something on bribery
from Jordan Kock-a-rocka,

33:32.810 --> 33:35.370
and I won't need you
to wear a Wire with Peter.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.378
But only if I get
something real.

33:37.410 --> 33:39.241
We'll get you something.
Right, Eli?

33:40.280 --> 33:42.214
Sure.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.718
I can't work
for you two anymore.

33:44.750 --> 33:46.217
What? Why not?

33:46.250 --> 33:48.115
The firm won't allow it.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.388
I can't work
for both sides.

33:49.420 --> 33:51.786
So, here's your
check back.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.559
You're kidding me.
I don't know What

33:53.590 --> 33:55.251
that other stuff is
that ended up

33:55.300 --> 33:56.426
in the envelope with my check.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.769
It could be anything.

34:01.370 --> 34:03.338
They settled on another case?

34:03.370 --> 34:05.065
Thief settled on
something else?

34:05.110 --> 34:06.668
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:06.710 --> 34:09.133
I can't be working
for the Red Team.

34:09.180 --> 34:11.307
(chuckles)

34:15.220 --> 34:16.448
Hey, there you are.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.311
You left all your stuff here
last night.

34:18.350 --> 34:20.682
Yeah, I know.
I had to rush out.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.119
What's going on?

34:22.160 --> 34:25.049
Yeah, Kalinda got us something.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.755
DAVID:
Hey.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.688
I hear you two are causing
a lot of problems here.

34:30.730 --> 34:33.221
Just doing our jobs.

34:33.270 --> 34:34.862
I need to borrow Alicia
for a minute.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.368
Why?

34:37.400 --> 34:39.368
No reason. Just a quick thing.

34:43.780 --> 34:47.307
So, the partners had
a change of heart.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.875
If you still want to be
an equity partner,

34:49.920 --> 34:51.217
we want you.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.445
Thank you.

34:53.490 --> 34:54.616
You're welcome.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.355
We need your capital
contribution

34:56.390 --> 34:57.584
within the next 24 hours

34:57.620 --> 34:59.679
or the offer moves on
to someone else.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.449
Wow. You really make a girl
feel appreciated.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.320
Were you under
the mistaken impression

35:04.370 --> 35:06.395
that we were here
for your appreCIation?

35:06.430 --> 35:07.863
Do you want it or not?

35:07.900 --> 35:10.334
I want it.

35:10.370 --> 35:13.259
Good. 24 hours.

35:13.310 --> 35:16.131
Is it all the fourth years?

35:16.180 --> 35:18.603
No, just you. We only had
one position, you got it.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.844
Why?

35:19.880 --> 35:21.575
My guess?

35:21.620 --> 35:24.339
We think your husband's going
to be governor.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.641
How's that?

35:25.690 --> 35:27.442
Feel appreciated now?

35:36.830 --> 35:39.469
PERRO'I'I'I:
Just talk
with your normal voice.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.434
Did you do anything illegal?

35:41.470 --> 35:43.495
Did you bribe someone?

35:43.540 --> 35:46.407
I hope we're a little
more subtle than that.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.169
Offer a "testing,
one, two, three"

35:48.210 --> 35:49.609
every now and then
in private.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.675
If there's problem,

35:50.710 --> 35:52.769
we'll text you
"Not good." Okay?

35:52.810 --> 35:53.947
Okay.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.868
Let's do it.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.327
Did you make an earlier wrongful
death settlement

36:04.360 --> 36:06.885
resulting from your
energy drink Dogfight?

36:06.930 --> 36:09.421
Uh, excuse me,
Your Honor.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.564
Uh, objection.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.295
May we approach
the bench?

36:13.330 --> 36:14.365
Sure.

36:18.570 --> 36:19.901
CARY:
Your Honor, we
have information

36:19.940 --> 36:21.407
that Thief settled a
wrongful death suit

36:21.440 --> 36:22.668
on one of their
earlier products.

36:22.710 --> 36:23.802
What information?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.501
If, in fact, there
was a prior settlement,

36:25.550 --> 36:27.279
it was subject
to a gag order.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.811
Yes, Your Honor.
but any gag order's

36:28.850 --> 36:30.044
not the concern
of this court.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.208
That may be true,
but substantiating
this supposed settlement

36:33.250 --> 36:34.581
would be the subject.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.258
Okay, thank you.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.383
I will be siding
with the defense here.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.556
What a surprise.

36:39.590 --> 36:40.682
Go cry to your fourth years.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.823
Step back.

36:51.970 --> 36:53.858
What's wrong with you?

36:54.910 --> 36:56.935
Nothing.

36:56.980 --> 36:59.471
Not a thing.

36:59.510 --> 37:00.772
PERRO'I'I'I:
Want some?

37:00.810 --> 37:01.572
No, thank you.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.679
Are you holding a grudge?
Nope.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.210
Just don't want
a biscotti anymore.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.912
ELI (over speaker):
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing, one, two, three.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.713
PERRO'I'I'I:
Go ahead.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.954
(beeps)

37:10.990 --> 37:12.480
(passing car horn honking)

37:12.530 --> 37:14.589
(cell phone chimes)

37:14.630 --> 37:15.858
Okay, I'm heading
into work right now.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.754
Testing, one, two, three.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.869
Were you ever married?

37:18.900 --> 37:21.289
I was.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.591
I was, too.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.937
Happily?

37:23.970 --> 37:25.437
I'm always happy.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.301
ELI:
Okay, I'm looking
for Jordan now.

37:27.340 --> 37:30.229
This will be my last
"testing, one, two, three."

37:31.040 --> 37:32.598
(knocking on door over speaker)

37:32.650 --> 37:33.901
(door opens)

37:33.950 --> 37:35.611
ELI:
Hey, do you have a minute?

37:35.650 --> 37:36.969
MAN:
Sure, Eli. What
do you need?

37:37.020 --> 37:38.385
(door closing)
You're not too busy?

37:38.420 --> 37:40.581
No, it's lunchtime.
I was just practicing.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.781
A busy life. No time
to expand my horizons.

37:42.820 --> 37:44.685
Here, how's this?

37:44.730 --> 37:48.427
(accordion plays
"Beer Barrel Polka")

37:48.460 --> 37:51.395
*

37:51.430 --> 37:53.022
Anyway, you get the idea.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.288
So, What do you need, Mr. Gold?

37:55.340 --> 37:57.729
How many dirty calls
did you hear me make?

37:57.770 --> 37:58.759
What's he doing?

37:58.810 --> 38:00.334
Getting him on the record.

38:00.370 --> 38:02.338
You can't... You...

38:02.380 --> 38:04.473
What? What can't I?

38:04.510 --> 38:07.479
He also scratched out "two"
and wrote in "three."

38:07.510 --> 38:08.818
Yeah. Where's your proof?

38:08.850 --> 38:10.909
He ripped up the proof.

38:10.950 --> 38:12.679
Yeah, tough break on that.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.618
I can't believe this.

38:13.650 --> 38:17.086
Elsbeth, I am
very disappointed in you.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.519
But you know
he scratched out "two"...

38:18.560 --> 38:19.788
David LaGuardia, please.
Hurry.

38:19.830 --> 38:20.979
Do I know that?

38:21.030 --> 38:24.056
What does it matter
ifI know it?
I just want to know.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.522
(phone ringing on speaker)
It doesn't matter either way.
We don't have proof.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.060
It was only two dirty calls,
wasn't it?

38:27.100 --> 38:28.533
Come on, pick
up, pick up.

38:28.570 --> 38:30.060
Hold on one second, Mr. Gold.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.732
Elsbeth.

38:33.710 --> 38:34.779
Hello? Hello?

38:34.810 --> 38:37.529
It was only
two dirty calls,

38:37.580 --> 38:39.445
wasn't it, David?

38:40.850 --> 38:43.671
Sure. We were one short.
Yes.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.119
Technicality.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.448
The law is filled
with technicalities.

38:47.490 --> 38:48.809
(phone ringing over speaker)

38:48.860 --> 38:50.816
David LaGuardia.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.953
He's on a Wire. _
He's got you on a Wire.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.526
This is Eli Gold.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.528
I am in the office
of David LaGuardia.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.460
He's just admitted
that his wiretapping

38:58.500 --> 39:00.525
application was insufficient!

39:00.570 --> 39:01.798
(hangs up phone)
Damn it.

39:05.070 --> 39:06.537
I think you're gonna have

39:06.570 --> 39:07.867
to exclude that earlier wiretap,
Mr. Perrotti.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.731
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.648
So, you've heard both cases now,

39:18.690 --> 39:20.715
and I just want to check
your temperatures again.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.513
How many are leaning toward
the plaintiff,

39:22.560 --> 39:24.118
that's the girl and her lawyers?

39:24.160 --> 39:25.718
Oh, that's a lot.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.079
Congratulations.

39:27.130 --> 39:28.688
Okay, and, um,

39:28.730 --> 39:30.823
now if you had to decide
on an amount to award,

39:30.860 --> 39:32.691
what would that be?

39:32.730 --> 39:34.436
MAN:
I think I'd say
around $50 million.

39:34.470 --> 39:36.938
I see a lot of heads nodding.
How many agree?

39:36.970 --> 39:40.804
Okay, we make a deal.
$12 million.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.400
Enough of these morons.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.000
(door opens)
Will, can we talk
for a minute?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.119
I was offered
the sole equity
partnership.

39:50.150 --> 39:51.845
I know. I heard.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.812
This didn't have
anything to do With...?

39:53.850 --> 39:55.989
No, no.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.453
Are you sure?
Because I...

39:57.490 --> 40:00.857
Alicia,
pat yourself on the back.

40:00.890 --> 40:03.825
You're good.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.521
This is because
you're good.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.061
Okay.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.806
What are we gonna do?

40:13.840 --> 40:17.003
I don't know.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.871
It was a weak moment.

40:18.910 --> 40:21.674
I know.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.987
We should avoid
being alone together.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.011
Yeah.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.527
Okay.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.693
I'm sorry, Will.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.192
About What?

40:38.230 --> 40:40.926
Oh, I don't know.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.835
What am I not sorry about?
(chuckles)

40:42.870 --> 40:45.464
It's life.

40:45.510 --> 40:48.070
We're in constant danger
of running off the road.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.786
CARY:
I guess we won.

41:02.820 --> 41:04.253
It doesn't feel
like it, does it?

41:04.290 --> 41:07.521
Hey, I'm thinking of meeting
with the Thief people

41:07.560 --> 41:10.529
just to get the partners scared
we're pursuing them.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.027
Does it sound good?

41:23.880 --> 41:25.802
Cary?

41:25.850 --> 41:28.239
What?

41:28.280 --> 41:31.613
They offered me
equity partnership.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.242
Again.

41:36.990 --> 41:39.550
Really?
Yes.

41:39.590 --> 41:40.989
Earlier.

41:43.730 --> 41:44.924
I'm gonna take it.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.165
That's smart.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.167
You think so?

41:48.200 --> 41:49.497
Yeah.

41:52.170 --> 41:55.571
I can, I can argue
for What we want there.

41:55.610 --> 41:58.579
Argue? What do you mean?

41:58.610 --> 42:01.249
With the equity partners,
I can argue...

42:01.280 --> 42:04.249
with them for... things.

42:06.050 --> 42:08.917
Sure. It's a good idea.

42:17.700 --> 42:21.295
I know some of us have taken
the Florrick name in vain.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.365
(scattered laughter)

42:22.400 --> 42:25.039
Those of us who have gone up
against her husband.

42:25.070 --> 42:27.061
(laughter)

42:27.110 --> 42:28.668
But now we have a Florrick
in our ranks.

42:28.710 --> 42:31.304
Now we have_ a Florrick
Sitting With us.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.774
Ladies and gentlemen
of Lockhart/Gardner,

42:33.810 --> 42:37.678
I ask you to welcome our
newest equity partner

42:37.720 --> 42:39.779
Alicia Florrick.

42:47.130 --> 42:49.291
We're peers now.

42:49.330 --> 42:51.025
Welcome.

42:51.060 --> 42:52.197
Thank you.

42:52.230 --> 42:54.289
Congratulations.

42:54.330 --> 42:55.831
Thank you.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.104
Congratulations.
Thank you.

43:00.140 --> 43:03.303
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

43:08.180 --> 43:10.648
Congratulations.
Thank you.

Congratulations.
