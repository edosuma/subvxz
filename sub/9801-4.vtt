WEBVTT

00:16.265 --> 00:17.198
There he is.

00:17.266 --> 00:18.699
Get him!

00:18.767 --> 00:21.635
Get him!

00:28.877 --> 00:32.412
Welcome to the gala debut
of our Central Park

00:32.481 --> 00:33.315
Zoological Menagerie.

00:33.383 --> 00:36.785
We celebrate the splendiferous
occasion of today and look

00:36.853 --> 00:39.488
forward to the grand
possibilities of tomorrow with

00:39.555 --> 00:42.924
the burial of this
centennial time capsule!

00:47.330 --> 00:50.665
One hundred years from this day,
the children of our children...

00:50.733 --> 00:52.201
Sorry, squirrel.

00:52.268 --> 00:53.702
End of the line.

00:53.769 --> 00:55.770
Now, where's the key?

00:55.838 --> 00:56.805
Right here.

00:56.873 --> 01:00.442
See for yourself.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.011
No, don't look into the eyes!

01:02.078 --> 01:03.645
The key, get the key.

01:03.713 --> 01:05.047
Not today.

01:05.114 --> 01:08.150
And not for a hundred years.

01:16.292 --> 01:17.226
Ha ha!

01:17.293 --> 01:20.595
You won't crack that lock,
you villainous rodents.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.832
Talley-ho!

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.949 --> 01:43.419
And now, one hundred years
after it was buried with pomp

01:43.486 --> 01:47.089
and pageantry, all eyes are on
the unearthing of the zoo's

01:47.157 --> 01:49.224
centennial time capsule.

01:49.292 --> 01:51.960
What wonder will we find within?

01:52.028 --> 01:55.497
This is Chuck Charles,
live on the scene.

01:59.835 --> 02:01.303
We've got company, Skipper.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.905
The rats are removing something
from the zoo time capsule.

02:03.973 --> 02:06.675
Appears to be some sort of key.

02:06.742 --> 02:08.043
And they're getting away.

02:08.110 --> 02:09.511
Oh no they're not.

02:09.579 --> 02:13.148
Private and I are on our
the way over, over.

02:19.122 --> 02:20.522
The stories were true!

02:20.590 --> 02:24.726
And now the lost treasure of the
Golden Squirrel will finally

02:24.794 --> 02:26.361
belong to the rats!

02:26.429 --> 02:27.696
Totally.

02:27.763 --> 02:30.599
And this key is the
key to us finding it.

02:30.666 --> 02:33.969
Which makes it a key, like, both
in the literal and metaphorical

02:34.036 --> 02:35.270
sense.

02:35.338 --> 02:36.838
How deep is that!?

02:36.906 --> 02:39.341
Whatever that key
is, you don't get it.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.543
Literally or metaphorically.

02:41.611 --> 02:43.044
Ha!

02:43.113 --> 02:44.846
No way, he took the key!

02:44.914 --> 02:46.047
Get him!

02:46.116 --> 02:47.048
Literally?

02:47.117 --> 02:48.250
Just get the key.

02:48.318 --> 02:51.253
Whoa-oh-ho!

02:51.321 --> 02:52.354
Wha!

02:52.422 --> 02:54.556
Ah!

02:54.624 --> 02:57.926
- Na na-na.
- Huh, ugh, whoa!

02:57.994 --> 03:03.165
 Ha all right all right

03:04.967 --> 03:08.103
Maurice, read to me the latest
balance from the fort of

03:08.171 --> 03:09.838
the royal treasury.

03:11.274 --> 03:15.043
A buck 40 in change, two subway
tokens, one bottle cap...

03:15.111 --> 03:18.147
The king must have enough
wealth and treasure to keep him

03:18.214 --> 03:22.417
100 percent out of touch to the
needs of his common subjects.

03:22.485 --> 03:24.453
Like me!

03:24.454 --> 03:24.486
Like me!

03:26.956 --> 03:29.224
Whoa, whoa!

03:29.292 --> 03:30.359
Whoa, Skipper!

03:30.426 --> 03:33.195
Hang tight, Private.

03:33.263 --> 03:34.196
Yes!

03:34.264 --> 03:35.197
Awesome!

03:35.265 --> 03:36.398
Check me out.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.401
The key to the squirrel's
swag is totally... Oof!

03:39.469 --> 03:41.570
Looks like we're all out
of wealth and treasure.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.773
Unless something just happens
to drop out of the sky and...

03:44.840 --> 03:46.808
Ooh!

03:46.876 --> 03:52.447
Now what could this possibly...
Get 'em!

03:52.515 --> 03:54.749
But Skipper, shouldn't we
return this key to the zoo time

03:54.817 --> 03:56.151
capsule?

03:56.219 --> 03:57.653
Of course we should.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.389
But do you have any idea
what this key could mean?

04:00.456 --> 04:01.490
Tell 'em, Kowalski.

04:01.558 --> 04:03.758
The promise of mystery,
adventure, hidden clues, action

04:03.826 --> 04:06.328
set pieces, red herrings,
diabolical double-crosses and

04:06.396 --> 04:09.931
a thrilling climax that
ultimately bashes us all over

04:09.999 --> 04:12.601
the head with a lesson about
the importance of non-material

04:12.669 --> 04:13.602
possessions.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.603
Exactly.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.039
Who could say no to a good
old fashioned treasure hunt?

04:18.107 --> 04:19.908
Excuse me a little bit.

04:19.975 --> 04:23.512
I think I heard "treasure"
in and amongst those words.

04:23.580 --> 04:27.716
Since I touched that key for a
full 26 seconds, I'm entitled

04:27.783 --> 04:29.184
to half of it.

04:29.252 --> 04:31.620
Kowalski, accounting analysis.

04:31.688 --> 04:35.524
Uh, 26 seconds of nine tenths
of the law equals 50 percent

04:35.592 --> 04:36.692
share?

04:36.759 --> 04:40.161
Well, I question his motives,
but his math is impeccable.

04:40.230 --> 04:41.463
Fine, ring tail.

04:41.531 --> 04:45.300
But if you get in my way on this
road to high adventure, I'm

04:45.368 --> 04:46.835
running you over.

04:48.003 --> 04:49.003
Bushy tail?

04:49.071 --> 04:50.004
Are you home?

04:50.072 --> 04:51.005
We need squirrel intel.

04:51.073 --> 04:54.610
Ordinarily, when I think intelligence,
I would not think Fred.

04:54.677 --> 04:55.877
Guys, guys?

04:55.945 --> 04:58.313
Shh!

04:58.381 --> 05:00.716
My granny's up in the tree,
trying to take a nap.

05:00.783 --> 05:03.017
So let's all talk like this.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.085
Sorry, Fred.

05:04.153 --> 05:05.587
This should just take a second.

05:05.655 --> 05:09.491
We need you to take a look
at this squirrel artefact.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.660
Hmm.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.827
Okay, then.

05:12.895 --> 05:13.828
Later, guys.

05:13.896 --> 05:14.863
Fred!

05:14.930 --> 05:17.031
The key, what about...
Shh!

05:17.099 --> 05:18.267
The key.

05:18.334 --> 05:19.501
Hmm, what about it?

05:19.569 --> 05:23.037
Well, we were hoping you could
tell us something about it?

05:23.105 --> 05:25.173
Oh, tell you something about it.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.308
You said just look at it.

05:26.376 --> 05:29.210
Tell you something about it,
hmm, yeah, that's harder.

05:29.279 --> 05:30.211
Wait.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.748
What was it you said you
heard the rats say?

05:32.815 --> 05:34.849
The hidden...
Something?

05:34.917 --> 05:37.519
Of the glorious something,
with the treasure on top?

05:37.587 --> 05:38.553
No, no, no.

05:38.621 --> 05:42.724
It was the, uh, the missing...
No, that's not it.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.526
The enchanted...

05:45.595 --> 05:50.799
The lost treasure of
the Golden Squirrel.

05:50.866 --> 05:53.835
Ahh!

05:53.903 --> 05:55.003
Yes!

05:55.070 --> 05:56.505
Lost treasure!

05:56.572 --> 05:59.474
Eh, this is real treasure, right?

05:59.542 --> 06:02.411
Not one of those "friendship is
the greatest treasure of all"

06:02.478 --> 06:03.445
deals?

06:03.513 --> 06:05.814
Because you can't trade
friendship for, you know, the

06:05.881 --> 06:08.684
goods and the services.

06:08.751 --> 06:11.252
Hidden clues will guide you.

06:11.321 --> 06:15.890
Now that the key has been
exposed, you must find the

06:15.958 --> 06:18.660
treasure and destroy it!

06:18.728 --> 06:19.861
There, you see?

06:19.929 --> 06:24.366
We must use the key to find
the treasure and... Wait.

06:24.434 --> 06:26.768
Did you say, "Destroy
the treasure?"

06:26.836 --> 06:28.970
Not, "Spend it all as
fast as possible?"

06:29.038 --> 06:30.171
You must follow me.

06:30.239 --> 06:32.374
There isn't much time.

06:36.679 --> 06:37.946
Ho-o-old on.

06:38.013 --> 06:40.649
Why would we go through all the
trouble of finding that treasure

06:40.717 --> 06:42.451
if we're just gonna destroy it?

06:42.518 --> 06:43.952
That does seem illogical.

06:44.019 --> 06:46.921
If the treasure is so dangerous,
why not just leave it hidden?

06:46.989 --> 06:48.156
Because!

06:48.224 --> 06:51.926
There are those with greed in
their souls who will stop at

06:51.994 --> 06:55.697
nothing until they have the treasure.

06:55.698 --> 06:55.731
treasure.

06:59.769 --> 07:00.769
The rats!

07:02.204 --> 07:03.405
Of course.

07:03.473 --> 07:05.974
Imagine what the rats would do
if they ever got control of that

07:06.041 --> 07:07.709
much wealth and power.

07:07.777 --> 07:09.411
I've tried, but I can't.

07:09.479 --> 07:12.313
Too busy imagining what I would do.

07:12.382 --> 07:15.851
Right, it's your basic race for
the hidden treasure scenario.

07:15.918 --> 07:16.852
But how, Skipper?

07:16.919 --> 07:18.854
How do we even know
where to begin looking?

07:18.921 --> 07:20.054
Behold.

07:20.122 --> 07:22.691
The key.

07:22.759 --> 07:24.760
Er...
Er...

07:33.102 --> 07:35.169
Fred, your granny is brilliant.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.671
She sure is.

07:36.739 --> 07:39.908
How is it that she knows so
much about the treasure?

07:39.975 --> 07:42.143
Oh, wait, you mean her.

07:42.211 --> 07:43.177
Because that's not my granny.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.179
What do you mean,
that's not your granny?

07:45.247 --> 07:47.982
I told you, my granny's back
at the tree taking a nap.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.183
Fred?

07:49.251 --> 07:50.452
She hugged you.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.021
Well yeah, I mean, that did
strike me as a bit odd.

07:53.088 --> 07:55.323
But hey, what am I gonna
do, say no to a hug?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.525
I love hugs.

07:56.592 --> 07:57.626
Here.

07:57.693 --> 07:58.960
Here it is.

07:59.028 --> 08:00.995
In the zoo.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.031
Marlene's place.

08:03.032 --> 08:03.064
Marlene's place.

08:05.701 --> 08:06.668
Eh.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.169
Ah.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.071
Boss, did you hear that?

08:10.139 --> 08:12.674
They're going after the
first clue to the treasure.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.842
Awesome.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.209
Less work for us.

08:15.277 --> 08:18.179
If you have to work to get
treasure, that's just like a

08:18.247 --> 08:19.748
job, you know?

08:19.816 --> 08:20.782
Okay, careful.

08:20.850 --> 08:21.950
Watch out, that'd deli... Hey!

08:22.017 --> 08:25.253
Who didn't wipe their feet?

08:25.321 --> 08:27.422
Hmm?

08:27.490 --> 08:28.423
I'm sorry.

08:28.491 --> 08:30.592
What was it exactly that
you were looking for?

08:30.660 --> 08:33.193
You know, here, here in my house?

08:36.866 --> 08:38.700
My head makes thumps!

08:38.768 --> 08:40.134
Could be anything, Marlene.

08:40.202 --> 08:42.504
Trap door, recessed antechamber.

08:42.572 --> 08:43.605
Rico!

08:43.673 --> 08:44.673
Solve this mystery.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.141
Okay, enough.

08:47.209 --> 08:49.811
This is my home, I know
every inch of this place.

08:49.879 --> 08:52.180
And there are no trap doors.

08:52.247 --> 08:55.383
There are no recessed antechambers.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.485
No...

08:58.721 --> 09:00.455
Hidden staircases?

09:00.523 --> 09:01.456
Okay.

09:01.524 --> 09:04.826
I'm a-okay... Ugh!

09:04.894 --> 09:07.395
I calculate that I am
about halfway do...

09:13.503 --> 09:16.938
Wow, this actually adds a lot
of square footage to my place.

09:17.006 --> 09:20.141
Fred, can you take
a look at these mysterious

09:20.209 --> 09:21.676
squirrel carvings?

09:21.744 --> 09:24.813
Not a problem.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.247
When I say, "look at them,"

09:26.315 --> 09:28.617
Fred, I mean, "can
you read them?"

09:28.684 --> 09:29.618
Oh, read them.

09:29.685 --> 09:32.621
Well, sure I can, but you
know, that's harder.

09:32.688 --> 09:34.723
Skipper, it looks
like this section of the tunnel

09:34.790 --> 09:37.225
was part of the city's
original sewer system.

09:37.292 --> 09:40.161
I could convert this into a
killer game room, you know, get

09:40.229 --> 09:42.964
some light in here,
foosball, maybe air hockey.

09:43.032 --> 09:44.165
Hey, guys?

09:44.233 --> 09:47.168
It says, "Ahead lies the path
to the treasure of the Golden

09:47.236 --> 09:49.838
Squirrel and certain riches. "

09:49.906 --> 09:52.774
Marlene!

09:52.842 --> 09:54.009
Oh, and guys?

09:54.076 --> 09:56.310
This part says something about traps?

09:56.378 --> 09:58.880
Yeah, deadly traps, maybe I
should have read that part

09:58.948 --> 10:00.214
first, huh?

10:00.282 --> 10:02.250
Ah!

10:02.251 --> 10:02.283
Ah!

10:05.655 --> 10:07.022
Skipper, look, there it is.

10:07.089 --> 10:09.057
That must be the clue.

10:09.058 --> 10:09.090
That must be the clue.

10:12.628 --> 10:13.562
Ooh ooh ooh!

10:13.629 --> 10:15.363
A mysterious ancient map.

10:15.431 --> 10:16.397
It's classic.

10:16.465 --> 10:18.567
Well then, what is it
that we are waiting for?

10:18.634 --> 10:19.734
Not so fast, ring tail.

10:19.802 --> 10:22.871
This whole place is no
doubtedly booby trapped.

10:22.939 --> 10:24.072
Of course!

10:24.139 --> 10:28.777
Do you really think that I would
be so careless as to just fling

10:28.844 --> 10:30.445
myself after the map?

10:30.512 --> 10:31.613
Ha ha.

10:31.681 --> 10:32.647
Mort!

10:32.715 --> 10:34.449
Deal with the booby traps.

10:34.516 --> 10:36.117
Booby sounds fun!

10:36.185 --> 10:37.318
Mort, no!

10:42.792 --> 10:43.725
Ah hai ya!

10:43.793 --> 10:44.893
Can I do it again?

10:44.961 --> 10:46.995
There, was that so hard?

10:49.231 --> 10:50.164
Ah!

10:50.232 --> 10:52.200
Follow me.

10:52.201 --> 10:52.233
Follow me.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.172
We'll take that map.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.507
And the key!

11:01.477 --> 11:02.877
Oh, mine!

11:02.945 --> 11:06.748
Eh...
Ahh!

11:06.816 --> 11:08.016
Ha ha.

11:09.551 --> 11:11.185
Hey, hey, hey!

11:11.253 --> 11:12.253
Move it.

11:12.321 --> 11:14.288
Marlene!

11:14.356 --> 11:17.592
We had better get out of here.

11:17.593 --> 11:17.626
here.

11:20.329 --> 11:21.262
We're trapped!

11:21.330 --> 11:23.264
This whole place is gonna collapse!

11:23.332 --> 11:24.298
Kowalski, how long?

11:24.366 --> 11:28.402
I would estimate total structural
failure at approximately...

11:28.470 --> 11:30.438
Right now.

11:36.444 --> 11:37.377
Go!

11:37.445 --> 11:40.380
Uh, you mean down the
big tube shooting fire?

11:40.448 --> 11:41.581
Thank you but no thank you.

11:41.649 --> 11:45.252
If we time it between the merciless
blasts of broiling flame...

11:45.320 --> 11:48.789
There's a miniscule
chance of survival.

11:48.857 --> 11:50.925
On my mark.

11:50.992 --> 11:52.960
Now.

11:52.961 --> 11:52.993
Now.

11:55.263 --> 11:56.197
Ah!

11:56.264 --> 11:59.834
Ah!

11:59.901 --> 12:01.101
Oh hey, guys.

12:01.169 --> 12:03.270
Um, the rats have a message for you.

12:03.338 --> 12:05.439
Something about meeting them in
Chinatown in an hour with the

12:05.506 --> 12:07.942
key and that if you ever wanna
see your friend again, you know

12:08.009 --> 12:09.210
what that's all about?

12:09.277 --> 12:12.213
Hey, what happened to the otter?

12:21.857 --> 12:23.257
Meter's running.

12:30.498 --> 12:32.566
Hmm... Ah!

12:32.633 --> 12:33.868
Uh, Skipper?

12:33.935 --> 12:36.303
Fred, what can you make of these?

12:36.371 --> 12:38.305
Hmm, let's see, now.

12:38.373 --> 12:43.310
This part says...
"Only the pure of heart will

12:43.378 --> 12:49.016
have the strength
to see the truth. "

12:49.084 --> 12:50.584
Pure of heart, eh?

12:50.651 --> 12:53.487
Well that's classic,
bordering on clichÃ©.

12:57.993 --> 13:00.327
But how will we know
which of us is pure of heart?

13:00.395 --> 13:03.030
You must risk
looking into the eyes of the

13:03.098 --> 13:04.431
squirrel.

13:06.301 --> 13:07.268
Ah!

13:07.335 --> 13:10.337
She's back.

13:11.539 --> 13:14.508
They know of your deepest secrets.

13:14.575 --> 13:16.543
Your greediest desires.

13:16.544 --> 13:16.576
Your greediest desires.

13:20.448 --> 13:24.418
You must be strong enough to
resist them, or you will be

13:24.485 --> 13:28.122
consumed by your own greed.

13:28.189 --> 13:31.959
This is the curse of the treasure.

13:36.031 --> 13:38.532
Fine, we get it, the
treasure's cursed.

13:38.599 --> 13:40.401
Are we done with the jib-jab?

13:40.468 --> 13:42.569
Let's get on the road
to high adventure.

13:42.637 --> 13:45.172
Curse or no, we still need to
trade this key to get back our

13:45.240 --> 13:46.173
friend.

13:46.241 --> 13:49.310
So I'll just hold
this and look into...

13:49.377 --> 13:52.579
The eyes of the
squirrel, they know of your

13:52.647 --> 13:54.548
deepest secrets.

13:54.615 --> 13:55.983
Where am I?

13:56.051 --> 13:57.484
How did I get...?

13:57.552 --> 14:00.520
Greetings, Maurice.

14:00.588 --> 14:02.622
We are here to serve you.

14:02.690 --> 14:04.959
Heh.

14:06.861 --> 14:07.828
Oh yeah!

14:07.895 --> 14:09.129
My deepest desire.

14:09.197 --> 14:10.697
Oh, I could get used to this.

14:10.765 --> 14:12.799
Maurice.

14:12.867 --> 14:13.800
Maurice!

14:13.868 --> 14:16.403
Quit daydreaming and
give me the key already.

14:16.471 --> 14:20.007
But if we give them this, we won't
be able to get the treasure.

14:20.075 --> 14:21.075
Finally.

14:21.142 --> 14:22.176
You see?

14:22.243 --> 14:24.178
This is exactly what
I have been saying.

14:24.245 --> 14:26.380
We don't have time to
argue with you lemurs.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.414
Kowalski.

14:27.482 --> 14:32.619
Coming right up, Skipp...
Oh, oh boy.

14:32.687 --> 14:33.887
That's strange.

14:33.955 --> 14:36.857
I'm obviously under the hypnotic
influence of some sort of...

14:36.924 --> 14:37.858
Oh!

14:37.925 --> 14:39.093
Is that!?

14:39.160 --> 14:41.928
An upgraded cerebellum
of my own design?

14:41.997 --> 14:43.163
Oh!

14:44.765 --> 14:46.166
Perfect fit!

14:47.902 --> 14:49.236
Kowalski!

14:49.304 --> 14:50.371
Kowalski!

14:50.438 --> 14:51.505
Hand over that key!

14:51.572 --> 14:52.506
That's an order.

14:52.573 --> 14:53.507
No!

14:53.574 --> 14:56.710
I... I think we need to
weigh our other options.

14:56.777 --> 14:59.413
In that case, you leave me no choice.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.515
Rico, take Kowalski into custody.

15:01.582 --> 15:04.385
Schedule a court martial for...
Rico.

15:04.452 --> 15:07.154
Blah!

15:08.623 --> 15:09.589
Ah!

15:09.657 --> 15:11.125
Ah, ah, robot!

15:11.192 --> 15:12.592
Ah, ah, ah!

15:12.660 --> 15:15.195
Ah, ah, ah... Mine!

15:15.263 --> 15:18.165
But guys, we already voted to
trade the treasure to save

15:18.233 --> 15:19.233
Marlene.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.903
That wasn't so much a vote
as a poll, if you will.

15:22.970 --> 15:24.238
Yeah, things change.

15:24.305 --> 15:25.339
Forget Marlene.

15:25.407 --> 15:27.908
I'm sorry, Skipper, but I
have seen myself with a

15:27.975 --> 15:31.912
4,000 pound cerebral
cortex and I am beautiful!

15:31.979 --> 15:33.313
Not so fast, brainiac.

15:33.381 --> 15:36.383
I need that treasure for my
army of Julien manservants.

15:36.451 --> 15:37.518
Yes, you see?

15:37.585 --> 15:40.954
Maurice needs the treasure for his...
Wait, go back a little bit?

15:41.022 --> 15:43.823
 Ah ah ahah ah ah!

15:46.461 --> 15:48.462
Skipper, we have to do something.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.065
Relax, Private, this is just the
part of the adventure where

15:51.132 --> 15:52.866
we start to turn on each other.

15:52.934 --> 15:54.301
No use fighting it.

15:54.369 --> 15:56.870
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

16:01.342 --> 16:03.110
It's the curse!

16:04.546 --> 16:06.313
Lady, again?

16:06.381 --> 16:07.714
Weren't you just here?

16:07.782 --> 16:09.583
Their greed is changing them.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.618
The treasure must be destroyed.

16:11.686 --> 16:15.322
It's the only way.

16:15.390 --> 16:18.325
Hey, I told you, I don't
even know this lady.

16:18.393 --> 16:20.660
Well, how did she do the
thing with the wind and all

16:20.728 --> 16:22.162
that thunder stuff?

16:22.230 --> 16:23.363
I don't know.

16:23.431 --> 16:26.666
She gives good hugs, though.

16:26.734 --> 16:29.002
This key is going to the rats.

16:29.070 --> 16:30.537
Yes it is.

16:30.605 --> 16:35.175
And since I already have the
map and your friend... Oof!

16:35.243 --> 16:38.512
I guess that means I'll take it all.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.547
That figures.

16:40.615 --> 16:42.349
Oof!

16:43.651 --> 16:44.718
Skipper, move it.

16:44.785 --> 16:47.488
We have to give chase to the
rats who are absconding with my

16:47.555 --> 16:48.888
booty!

16:48.956 --> 16:52.126
Not my booty booty, my treasure booty!

16:52.127 --> 16:52.159
booty!

17:03.438 --> 17:04.570
Let's see.

17:06.073 --> 17:07.874
Not this one.

17:07.942 --> 17:09.041
Not that one.

17:10.444 --> 17:11.678
Ah!

17:11.746 --> 17:14.214
Ah... You guys seem
to think that this

17:14.281 --> 17:16.550
treasure is gonna be the
answer to all your...

17:16.617 --> 17:19.786
That this treasure's
gonna be the answer...

17:19.854 --> 17:23.390
Oh, vaulted ceilings, spacious
design, I love what I've done

17:23.458 --> 17:25.425
with the place!

17:25.425 --> 17:25.459
with the place!

17:30.698 --> 17:32.666
Eh, huh?

17:32.667 --> 17:32.699
Eh, huh?

17:35.970 --> 17:37.404
Hey, wait!

17:37.472 --> 17:40.274
She found it, get her!

17:40.341 --> 17:43.277
Boys, look, it's the treasure.

17:43.344 --> 17:45.712
Look how much of it there is.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.747
Awesome.

17:47.748 --> 17:47.781
Awesome.

17:51.286 --> 17:53.320
I don't have a better
word than awesome.

17:53.388 --> 17:55.322
So I'm just gonna say awesome again.

17:55.390 --> 17:56.890
But this time, louder.

17:56.957 --> 17:58.925
Awesome!

17:58.926 --> 17:58.958
Awesome!

18:13.174 --> 18:16.176
Marlene!

18:16.244 --> 18:17.277
You!

18:17.345 --> 18:18.778
But how did you find us?

18:18.846 --> 18:19.946
We took the map.

18:20.014 --> 18:21.615
Yes, you did.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.618
Fortunately, we have a
photographic memory.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.652
We do?

18:25.720 --> 18:26.786
Well, technically, no.

18:26.854 --> 18:29.189
But we do have a photographic camera.

18:29.257 --> 18:30.957
Which is almost as convenient.

18:31.025 --> 18:32.992
Plus it corrects for red eye.

18:32.993 --> 18:33.026
Plus it corrects for red eye.

18:35.396 --> 18:37.598
Quick, get more gold than the rats.

18:37.665 --> 18:39.533
We can beat them.

18:39.601 --> 18:43.370
No, you must dare to look into
the eyes of the squirrel.

18:43.438 --> 18:49.610
Into your deepest des...
He who is pure of heart will see

18:49.677 --> 18:51.945
the truth.

18:52.012 --> 18:54.514
Will someone give me one good
reason why we keep listening to

18:54.582 --> 18:56.783
this raving banshee?

18:56.851 --> 18:58.385
Fine, give me that thing.

18:58.453 --> 19:00.420
But Skipper, what about the curse?

19:00.488 --> 19:01.421
Don't worry, Private.

19:01.489 --> 19:02.656
Money can't buy honour.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.657
Or courage.

19:03.725 --> 19:04.691
Character.

19:04.759 --> 19:08.295
I'm immune to...
Ahh.

19:08.363 --> 19:09.763
Ha ha ha ha ha!

19:09.830 --> 19:11.965
I'll take five of these
and three of that one.

19:12.032 --> 19:13.367
No, the big one.

19:13.434 --> 19:15.402
The really big one.

19:15.403 --> 19:15.435
The really big one.

19:17.672 --> 19:19.273
Come on, get some!

19:19.340 --> 19:21.040
Whoo!

19:21.108 --> 19:22.309
Oh dear.

19:22.377 --> 19:24.444
Well that didn't work out so well.

19:24.512 --> 19:28.081
I guess I'd better have a go.

19:30.985 --> 19:33.253
Baby ducklings, they're so cute.

19:33.321 --> 19:35.289
And they're all mine.

19:35.356 --> 19:36.290
No way, Private.

19:36.357 --> 19:38.692
We need those funds for
the defence budget.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.893
No!

19:39.960 --> 19:42.996
It's mine, you can never
have enough Spanish guitars.

19:44.499 --> 19:45.432
Ducklings!

19:45.500 --> 19:47.267
Tanks!

19:47.335 --> 19:50.537
Ah!

19:50.605 --> 19:51.538
Whoa!

19:51.606 --> 19:55.208
This must be my greed fantasy, now.

19:55.276 --> 19:59.479
I can hardly wait to see the
depths of my own depravity.

19:59.547 --> 20:01.682
This is gonna be good, y'all.

20:01.749 --> 20:04.818
Oh yeah, here we go.

20:04.885 --> 20:10.190
It's... It's my kingdom and...
Hi!

20:10.257 --> 20:11.658
Maurice?

20:11.726 --> 20:13.193
And Mort?

20:13.260 --> 20:15.495
You, do
you see the truth?

20:15.563 --> 20:17.798
I see that I have been ripped off.

20:17.865 --> 20:18.832
Hello?

20:18.899 --> 20:21.802
Thought we were supposed to be
seeing our greatest desires,

20:21.869 --> 20:22.803
here.

20:22.870 --> 20:29.042
Not just... Unless...
Unless... I already h...

20:29.109 --> 20:31.244
Do you see the truth?

20:31.312 --> 20:32.879
Just shut up, squirrel lady.

20:32.947 --> 20:36.450
Trying to have a meaningful
epiphany moment over here.

20:36.517 --> 20:41.555
Unless...
I already have my greatest desire.

20:41.622 --> 20:42.556
Ahh!

20:42.623 --> 20:45.559
I get it!

20:45.626 --> 20:47.594
I see the truth.

20:47.595 --> 20:47.627
I see the truth.

20:50.698 --> 20:51.732
Huh!?

20:51.799 --> 20:54.401
The only way to win is
to get rid of all of it.

20:54.469 --> 20:57.203
It will sink their side
of the platform, too.

20:58.406 --> 21:01.074
That went well, yes.

21:01.141 --> 21:04.511
Huh?

21:04.579 --> 21:08.348
Oof!

21:10.050 --> 21:11.718
Ahh!

21:11.786 --> 21:13.754
This is not awesome!

21:13.755 --> 21:13.787
This is not awesome!

21:26.567 --> 21:28.268
Ahh...!

21:30.705 --> 21:34.307
Where's the love?

21:34.375 --> 21:35.842
Ow!

21:38.780 --> 21:39.946
Yeah!

21:43.484 --> 21:48.288
So it turns out that I am the
one who is pure of heart.

21:48.355 --> 21:49.556
Ha, me!

21:49.624 --> 21:50.924
Yes, me!

21:50.991 --> 21:53.026
M to the E, me.

21:53.093 --> 21:55.896
I guess we can chock that
up as the surprise ending.

21:55.963 --> 21:57.631
You call that an ending?

21:57.698 --> 22:01.968
A proper ending is supposed
to be emotionally satisfying.

22:02.036 --> 22:04.671
Yeah, well I'm just
satisfied that it's over.

22:04.739 --> 22:06.105
Ugh, and how.

22:06.173 --> 22:07.140
Yeah.

22:07.207 --> 22:09.943
Gah, if I never hear another
word about treasures or clues,

22:10.010 --> 22:10.944
or, huh?

22:11.011 --> 22:12.145
No time to explain.

22:12.212 --> 22:15.148
This is the legendary feather
of the Crystal Falcon.

22:15.215 --> 22:18.885
Guard it with your life.

22:18.953 --> 22:19.886
Huh!

22:19.954 --> 22:21.421
Kowalski, analysis.

22:21.489 --> 22:23.657
High probability of
globetrotting escapades,

22:23.724 --> 22:26.326
ruthless villains and ancient
riches, all tied up nicely by

22:26.393 --> 22:29.062
the heartfelt realization that
we had what we were looking for

22:29.129 --> 22:31.097
inside us all along.

22:31.165 --> 22:32.632
Ooh, I'm in.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.869
Who can say no to a mystical quest?

22:35.937 --> 22:38.237
Private, I'll need you to...
Private?

22:38.305 --> 22:39.405
Hey, wait.

22:39.474 --> 22:40.406
Hey, where you going?

22:40.475 --> 22:41.407
This isn't the ending anymore.

22:41.476 --> 22:43.443
Come on, it's the beginning now.
