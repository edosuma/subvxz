- No.

- Great. Let's go do something else.
- No, I-I mean... Yes.

Okay. Maybe the shoes are a
little too overwhelming for you.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.691
When was the last time
you wore this dress?

02:03.725 --> 02:07.328

- I was with you when you bought it.

- [ scoffs ] Donation pile.

Yes, but we both know something's wrong.

Cailin, hi.
Uh, come on in.

me out of the way,

Maybe robbery was the motive.

- I-I don't know.

08:31.334 --> 08:32.835
Anybody know where his mom is?

Uh, sometimes she goes outside to smoke
when the kid's line is off the ice.

08:36.673 --> 08:39.674
- Son, what's your name?
- Drew ... Drew Bigsby.

08:39.743 --> 08:41.844
Okay, Drew. We're gonna step outside.
We're gonna look for your mom, okay?

08:41.912 --> 08:44.145
- And what's her name?
- Mary Bigsby.

08:44.181 --> 08:45.381
Could ... could you stay
with him for a few minutes?

08:45.415 --> 08:47.283
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Wh-what's going on?

08:47.317 --> 08:49.985
Everything's okay. If we could
all just stay inside, please?

Okay? Keep him inside,
please. Thank you.

09:01.164 --> 09:03.933
So she was bleeding
when she left the rink,

09:03.967 --> 09:06.469
- which doesn't make sense.
- Why not?

09:06.503 --> 09:09.939
Come on. Take a look at the body.
Tell me what you think.

09:09.973 --> 09:13.943
Hey, Frost. Can you run
a DMV search on Mary Bigsby?

09:13.977 --> 09:15.010
Is that Mary?

09:15.045 --> 09:19.815
- Think so.
- Okay. Here we go.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.717
Mary Bigsby drives a blue minivan.

09:21.785 --> 09:24.353
I got the tags right
here. We'll find it.

09:26.156 --> 09:27.456
Your mother is staying with Cailin.

09:27.491 --> 09:30.593
- Do you think that's okay?
- Do I think it's okay

09:30.627 --> 09:32.628
that my mother is
babysitting a grown adult?

09:32.662 --> 09:35.531
- No, I do not.
- Hope was so insistent.

09:35.565 --> 09:39.068
Hope should back off.
Just talk to me about the body.

09:39.135 --> 09:41.971
She has a broken nose and a
jagged injury to her throat.

09:42.005 --> 09:44.273
- See what doesn't make any sense?
- What doesn't make sense?

09:44.307 --> 09:47.276
Two injuries ... broken
nose and a slashed throat.

09:47.310 --> 09:48.878
- They're separate.
- Well, how do you know that?

09:48.912 --> 09:53.449
Well, the blood spatter says
that she was ambushed from behind,

09:53.483 --> 09:57.820
but the droplets from her busted nose
says that she was punched over there.

09:57.854 --> 09:59.655
You think we're looking
for two attackers?

09:59.689 --> 10:01.690
Maybe.

10:01.725 --> 10:04.460
I think there may be a
speed-burn mark under the blood.

10:07.097 --> 10:10.699
You're right.
No bloody tire tracks, though.

10:10.767 --> 10:12.835
So what does that mean?

10:12.869 --> 10:15.604
Somebody was going in
reverse, braked hard here,

10:15.639 --> 10:18.507
and then sped off before she bled out.

10:18.542 --> 10:21.043
You think the killer took the
victim's car? We find her keys?

10:21.077 --> 10:22.811
Negative. You think we're
looking at a carjacking?

10:22.846 --> 10:24.880
You got a choice of cars,
you steal a minivan?

10:24.915 --> 10:27.616
Frankie's got eyes on
Mary Bigsby's minivan.

10:31.121 --> 10:34.390
<i>- Someone inside.
- All right, you take the right.</i>

10:34.424 --> 10:35.658

hands on the wheel now.</i>

10:35.692 --> 10:38.294
<i>Do not move your hands.
Keep them on that wheel.</i>

10:38.361 --> 10:41.047
All right, when I tell you, you clasp
your hands behind your head.

10:41.082 --> 10:42.565
Do it now.

10:42.599 --> 10:44.400
<i>All right. Now slowly
get out of the car.</i>

10:44.434 --> 10:46.835
<i>Keep your hands where they are.</i>

10:46.870 --> 10:48.504
- We've got blood.
- Mary: Oh, come on.

10:48.538 --> 10:49.738
<i>See if she has any I.D.</i>

10:49.773 --> 10:51.540
All this over a
hockey-mom shoving match?

11:00.650 --> 11:03.485
- You are Mary Bigsby?
- That's right.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.989
- Take her in for questioning.
- Let's go. Come on.

11:11.261 --> 11:15.397
- If that's Mary Bigsby...
- Who's that?

11:17.934 --> 11:21.870
Hey, fellas. Need you to
take a look at the victim.

11:21.905 --> 11:24.707
[ beep ]
You recognize her?

11:25.509 --> 11:28.143
Ew. It's horrible.
Yeah.

11:28.178 --> 11:30.512
She looks like that lady who showed
up during practice, doesn't she?

11:30.547 --> 11:32.881
- Yeah, I think so.
- You know her name?

11:32.916 --> 11:34.917
No. She was very nice.

11:34.951 --> 11:36.919
- She was a saleslady.
- Saleslady.

11:36.953 --> 11:39.221
Yeah, she gave one of
these to all the players.

11:39.255 --> 11:43.626
- No-drip helmet pads.
- The kids wore them while they warmed up.

11:43.660 --> 11:44.960
The kids were really excited

11:44.995 --> 11:46.595
because she said the pads could
tell if they were dehydrated.

11:46.630 --> 11:48.430
- How do they do that?
- No idea.

11:48.465 --> 11:51.500
She gave the kids baggies,
had them write their names on them,

11:51.534 --> 11:53.402
and she collected them before the game.

11:53.436 --> 11:55.137
She took back used helmet pads?

11:55.171 --> 11:58.841
Yeah, she's gonna analyze them
and bring the results to the next game.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.609
Did you see what kind of car she drove?

12:00.644 --> 12:03.178
- No. No, sorry.
- Thank you both.

12:05.482 --> 12:08.784
I'm gonna look up that company.

12:08.852 --> 12:11.286
Are we really thinking
someone in here did this?

12:11.321 --> 12:13.288
<i>I mean, wouldn't they
be covered in blood?</i>

12:13.323 --> 12:16.792
Not necessarily.
Arterial blood spray projected forward.

12:16.826 --> 12:20.429
No such thing as no-drip helmet pads.

12:20.463 --> 12:22.097
How can that be?

12:22.132 --> 12:24.767
Our dead Jane Doe worked for
a company that doesn't exist?

12:27.370 --> 12:29.672
<i>Jane: Okay, thanks.</i>

12:29.706 --> 12:32.341
Crime lab has the results
on the blood on Mary's shirt.

12:32.409 --> 12:33.542
It matches our victim's.

12:33.576 --> 12:35.277
Who wants to face off
against a killer hockey mom?

12:35.345 --> 12:37.379
Been there, done that.

12:38.348 --> 12:40.649
I had to live through my
mother's hockey-mom years.

12:40.684 --> 12:42.518
Your mother is too nice
to be one of those mothers.

12:42.552 --> 12:45.320
Oh, yeah? Ask her about the time
that she stormed out onto the ice

12:45.388 --> 12:47.956
in the middle of Frankie's game
and hit the ref with her purse.

12:47.991 --> 12:50.926
- [ chuckles ] What did Frankie do?
- Tried to change his last name.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.295
[ laughs ]
We'll take this one, then.

12:53.329 --> 12:56.231
Okay. Good.
I'm going down to autopsy.

12:56.266 --> 12:58.934
Puncture wound is 0.5
centimeters at the apex.

13:00.303 --> 13:05.074
12.7 centimeters of jagged tear.

13:06.109 --> 13:09.278
Ugh. It's like someone pulled
her throat open with claws.

13:09.345 --> 13:11.213
What kind of murder weapon does that?

13:11.247 --> 13:14.683
It snagged the carotid.
Notice I said "snagged."

13:14.718 --> 13:16.051
I noticed.

13:16.119 --> 13:18.520
Notice how much I would love to
know what the murder weapon is.

13:18.555 --> 13:23.158
- Carotid artery was pulled until it tore.
- I notice you said "pulled."

13:23.226 --> 13:25.661
I did. By a weapon
with a curved end.

13:25.695 --> 13:28.097
Okay. We'll put out an all-points
bulletin for Captain Hook.

13:29.766 --> 13:32.401
There's a beige, gummy
substance in the wound.

13:32.435 --> 13:35.370
The lost boys' gummy bears?
[ chuckles ]

13:35.405 --> 13:36.839
[ cellphone vibrates ]

13:36.873 --> 13:41.543
Oh.
It's Hope. Again.

13:41.578 --> 13:42.845
<i>All right.</i>

13:42.879 --> 13:45.347
[ beep ]
Hello?

13:45.381 --> 13:48.550
<i>Yes. You know, I am just
in the middle of an autopsy.</i>

13:48.585 --> 13:53.322
No. I do not know if
Cailin did her homework,

13:53.389 --> 13:55.057
but she's a sophomore in college.

13:56.059 --> 13:58.560
Okay, I will. I will
make sure she goes to bed.

13:58.595 --> 14:01.497
- Okay, bye-bye.
- [ beep ] Wow.

14:01.531 --> 14:03.532
No wonder Cailin is frustrated.

14:03.566 --> 14:06.468
I am so glad that Constance
taught me to be independent.

14:06.503 --> 14:08.604
[ cellphone vibrates ]
What do I do?

14:08.638 --> 14:09.938
That's what they invented
voicemail for, Maura.

14:09.973 --> 14:12.040
- I can't.
- Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh.

14:12.075 --> 14:13.575
Hello?

14:13.610 --> 14:15.944
Yes. Yes.

14:15.979 --> 14:18.881
No, I did say that I would monitor her

14:18.915 --> 14:20.983
and make sure she takes
her immunosuppression drugs.

14:21.017 --> 14:23.986
No, no, no. You have
every right to worry.

14:24.020 --> 14:28.323
Okay. I'm sorry.
All right, bye-bye.

14:28.358 --> 14:30.192
[ beep ] Okay, you just
encouraged her to worry.

14:30.226 --> 14:32.728
I just keep forgetting that
Cailin had a kidney transplant.

14:32.762 --> 14:34.429
How do you forget?
It's your kidney.

14:38.434 --> 14:40.235
No hits.

14:42.105 --> 14:43.372
Who are you?

14:52.208 --> 14:54.625
Korsak: You have got a lot scrapes
and disturbing fees  {*corr}

14:54.626 --> 14:57.043
assault and battery, assault
with a deadly weapon?

14:57.077 --> 14:58.778
Deadly weapon?
It was a hockey stick.

14:58.812 --> 15:00.813
Which you used to break a referee's arm.

15:00.881 --> 15:03.683
He made bad calls, so I said
something, and he got personal.

15:03.717 --> 15:06.619
Is that what sets you off?
When someone gets personal?

15:06.653 --> 15:07.954
[ breathes deeply ]

15:08.021 --> 15:09.822
He called me a pig with lipstick.

15:09.856 --> 15:11.857
Man's lucky I don't have a temper.

15:11.892 --> 15:12.925
What did she call you?

15:12.960 --> 15:15.561
Is she dead?
What happened to her?

15:15.595 --> 15:18.364
You tell us. We found
her blood on your clothes.

15:18.432 --> 15:21.400
I punched her in the nose.
That's it. I didn't kill her.

15:21.435 --> 15:23.402
Did you get into it with her
at the game over your kids?

15:23.437 --> 15:24.503
She didn't even have a kid.

15:24.538 --> 15:26.172
- How do you know?
- It's a small league.

15:26.206 --> 15:28.240
I know all the parents.
Never seen her before.

15:28.308 --> 15:30.009
You just like punching strangers?

15:30.043 --> 15:32.878
I was trying to watch the game,
and that lady kept pushing me,

15:32.913 --> 15:34.914
and then she rolls
her case over my foot.

15:34.948 --> 15:37.821
- What case?
- I don't know. Some sales case.

15:37.856 --> 15:39.018
It hurt, so I pushed her back.

15:39.086 --> 15:40.686
Must have pushed her pretty hard.

15:40.754 --> 15:43.356
I am telling you, I didn't kill her.

15:43.390 --> 15:47.360
Just one punch, and I watched
her walk away. Look at my file ...

15:47.394 --> 15:50.696
Just fat lips, bloody
noses, and a ref's arm.

15:50.764 --> 15:53.366
Add a slashed throat.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.637
Oh, god.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:56.837 --> 15:59.538
[ vomits ]

15:59.573 --> 16:02.475
We're holding hockey mom, but
I don't think she's our killer.

16:02.509 --> 16:07.046
- That lady's as squeamish as Frost.
- Lady? She puked on the table.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.115
- Did she I.D. the victim, at least?
- No.

16:09.149 --> 16:11.317
Damn. Well, Maura's
checking her dental records.

16:11.351 --> 16:12.518
What else can we do?

16:12.552 --> 16:15.021
Every car in that parking
lot is accounted for.

16:15.088 --> 16:17.189
[ sighs ] Okay.

16:17.224 --> 16:19.358
There is no bus service in that area,

16:19.393 --> 16:22.094
there is no record of a
taxi dropping anyone off,

16:22.129 --> 16:24.731
and there is no way that
she walked more than half

16:24.732 --> 16:27.333
a block in those heels,
which means she had a car.

16:27.367 --> 16:30.302
And we showed all the parents,
employees, and coaches her photo.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.838
Kids remembered her
handing out helmet pads.

16:32.873 --> 16:33.939
<i>No one knew her name.</i>

16:33.974 --> 16:35.474
Killer took everything
that could identify her.

16:35.509 --> 16:37.043
Except her body.

16:38.678 --> 16:41.280
Maybe because he was interrupted.

16:41.314 --> 16:44.150
He pulls the car back, he stops here.

16:44.184 --> 16:46.786
Maybe he was about to
dump her body in the trunk

16:46.820 --> 16:48.220
and that's when
Mary came out to smoke.

16:48.255 --> 16:52.258
- That makes sense.
- But if we can't I.D. her, we're screwed,

16:52.292 --> 16:55.294
unless she had a car and we can find it.

16:56.296 --> 16:57.530
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt.

16:57.564 --> 17:00.633
- What's the matter?
- Cailin's missing.

17:05.972 --> 17:08.406
<i>Angela, is Cailin here?</i>

17:08.474 --> 17:11.143
- No, honey.
- She's not here, Jane.

17:11.211 --> 17:14.579
<i>No, I'm not asking you
to leave work. Okay.</i>

17:14.614 --> 17:16.015
I can't find Cailin.

17:16.049 --> 17:19.117
Um, well, when's the last
time you talked to her?

17:19.152 --> 17:21.119
Four hours ago.

17:21.154 --> 17:23.823
Yes. Yes,
I checked all the hospitals.

17:23.857 --> 17:25.657
<i>And you checked back with
the state troopers, right?</i>

17:25.692 --> 17:29.662
Maura, it's only 11:30.
She is a teenager.

17:29.696 --> 17:31.330
I think we should file
a missing person's.

17:31.364 --> 17:35.701
Yes, please, Jane.
Okay. Thank you.

17:35.735 --> 17:38.504
Are you really gonna put out
a missing person's bulletin?

17:38.538 --> 17:39.705
<i>She could be at school.</i>

17:39.739 --> 17:42.141
Well, I told her she had
to stay in touch with me.

17:42.175 --> 17:43.609
Did you give her a curfew?

17:43.643 --> 17:46.212
No. I didn't know I needed to.

17:46.246 --> 17:47.813
[ dog barking in distance ]

17:47.848 --> 17:49.281
[ door closes ]

17:49.316 --> 17:51.824
- Where the hell have you been?
- At the library.

17:51.859 --> 17:54.954
- Well, you cannot do that.
- I can't go to the library?

17:54.988 --> 17:57.523
No, you ... you cannot
not return my texts.

17:57.557 --> 18:01.093
Oh. Sorry. I-I turned my phone off.
I was studying.

18:01.128 --> 18:03.863
We ... we filed a missing
person's report on you.

18:03.897 --> 18:05.764
Oh, my god.
Why would you do that?

18:05.799 --> 18:07.366
Because I didn't know where you were!

18:07.400 --> 18:09.401
I thought...

18:10.537 --> 18:13.372
- I thought you were different.
- You thought if you stayed with me

18:13.406 --> 18:15.040
that you could just
do whatever you wanted.

18:15.075 --> 18:17.376
- Maura doesn't have kids.
- I'm not a kid.

18:17.410 --> 18:20.346
No, you're not, but she
is responsible for you.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.098
Well, I don't see how sending the police

18:22.099 --> 18:25.050
- on a wild goose chase is responsible.
- You know, I have to call Jane

18:25.085 --> 18:26.619
and tell her not to
put a bolo out for you.

18:26.686 --> 18:29.355
Yeah, she might have better
things to do, like solve a murder.

18:29.422 --> 18:31.023
Well, I know I have better things to do

18:31.091 --> 18:33.692
than take care of an
irresponsible, selfish teenager.

18:34.861 --> 18:36.595
Maura.

18:36.630 --> 18:40.866
Look, she was just worried.
That's all.

18:40.901 --> 18:43.035
Come on. Have a brownie.

18:44.538 --> 18:48.507
- Only if they have weed in them.
- You brought marijuana here?

18:48.542 --> 18:53.040
Yeah, 'cause that's what an
irresponsible, selfish teenager would do.

18:53.413 --> 18:54.914
It's a joke!

18:54.948 --> 18:57.283
Listen, I'm sure you're stressed-out
studying for your finals.

18:57.317 --> 18:59.302
Why don't you go take a bath?

18:59.303 --> 19:02.922
- I'll bring you a cup of tea.
- Okay.

19:05.659 --> 19:07.159
[ sighs ]

19:10.230 --> 19:12.831
I never get that angry.

19:12.866 --> 19:16.835
That's what a fight with
a sibling feels like.

19:16.870 --> 19:19.038
It'll be okay, Maura.

19:19.872 --> 19:21.840
[ chuckles ]

19:26.012 --> 19:28.314
<i>Cailin: [ chuckling ]
Oh, my god.</i>

19:28.348 --> 19:31.283
<i>Shut up.
Why would you let him do that?</i>

19:31.318 --> 19:33.786
- Good morning.
- Oh, hey.

19:33.820 --> 19:36.589
- You're up early.
- Yeah, we ... we never went to bed.

19:36.623 --> 19:39.124
Right. Why go to bed?

19:39.159 --> 19:42.628
You don't need any sleep for
rigorous premed coursework.

19:42.662 --> 19:44.964
[ chuckles ] I'm sure you
didn't need it, either,

19:44.998 --> 19:46.799
because you're a genius like Cailin.

19:46.833 --> 19:49.668
She aces everything
with or without sleep.

19:49.703 --> 19:54.673
- Does she?
- You can take a shower, if you want.

19:54.708 --> 19:57.076
Oh. Am I embarrassing you?
[ chuckles ]

19:57.944 --> 20:00.045
- I think you look great.
- Yeah, me too.

20:00.113 --> 20:03.983
It's so cool when women your age
look good even without makeup.

20:04.017 --> 20:08.787
- My age?
- It's a compliment, Maura.

20:08.822 --> 20:13.459
- Really?
- I almost tripped over this young man.

20:13.493 --> 20:16.011
I thought the homeless
moved in to Beacon Hill.

20:16.046 --> 20:19.331
Dylan's from Santa Cruz.
He misses sleeping outside.

20:19.366 --> 20:21.066
Yeah, I-I love sleeping
under the stars.

20:21.134 --> 20:23.369
Your brick walkway's not
very comfortable, though.

20:23.403 --> 20:24.837
Mm. [ chuckles ]

20:24.871 --> 20:29.942
- Cailin, can I speak to you upstairs?
- Man, that looks good.

20:29.976 --> 20:32.574
- Cool. Good thing it's for you, then.
- Oh.

20:32.609 --> 20:34.513
Maura: You are quite the hostess.

20:34.547 --> 20:37.850
You made breakfast for...
Dylan, is it?

20:37.884 --> 20:41.287
- Yeah, hey. How's it going?
- Cailin, that looks delicious.

20:41.321 --> 20:42.821
<i>Yours is in the oven, Mrs. Rizzoli.</i>

20:42.889 --> 20:48.027
So, do you want to talk now
or eat before your food gets cold?

20:53.133 --> 20:57.403
I wanted to scream
when I saw my kitchen.

20:57.437 --> 21:01.073
Yeah, well, children push buttons
you didn't even know you had.

21:01.141 --> 21:04.946
Well, she's not my child.
She's an adult... child.

21:04.981 --> 21:05.944
You know, I read somewhere

21:05.979 --> 21:11.617
the brain isn't fully developed
until 26, which explains a lot.

21:11.651 --> 21:14.720
Well, maybe Hope is right
in treating her like a kid.

All she did was have a couple
of friends over and make a mess.

21:19.633 --> 21:23.262
- Which we cleaned up.
- But she wasn't trying to get under your skin.

21:23.296 --> 21:26.198
She needs to learn. Set some boundaries.

Could a skate hook be the murder weapon?

Well, the puncture wound
was 0.05 centimeters.

<i>That is consistent with it.

So, our victim and our murder

Maybe our killer did, too.

<i>So, how many people were at the rink</i>

25:23.910 --> 25:25.744

you're not planning this.

Yeah, you can get DNA from sweat.

Only kids were wearing them, so
maybe she was looking for a kid.

Maybe. Okay, let's go back
to my missing-car theory.

- Harbor is right near the rink.

26:04.551 --> 26:07.052
Best place to deep-six a

26:07.120 --> 26:10.256
And we can't call the dive team
and have them search the entire harbor.

26:10.290 --> 26:11.624

we might as well bring everybody in

26:29.109 --> 26:30.509

Yes, that's Dr. Dalton.
She was a wonderful woman.

30:45.083 --> 30:47.751
Was she based here in Boston?

30:47.819 --> 30:50.821
No. Um, she was only in

30:50.855 --> 30:52.656
Our headquarters are in New York.

so we talked frequently.

30:56.328 --> 30:57.761
Do you know if she was married?

30:57.796 --> 31:00.698
No, she wasn't.
No children, either,

31:00.732 --> 31:03.000
which is probably why she was
such a dedicated researcher.

31:03.034 --> 31:04.635
What kind of research was she doing?

31:04.669 --> 31:06.737
Her passion was Huntington's disease.

31:06.771 --> 31:10.040
Huntington's is an incurable
hereditary brain disorder

31:10.075 --> 31:12.376
that damages nerve cells
and incapacitates you.

31:12.410 --> 31:16.046
- It's fatal.
- Did Dr. Dalton have Huntington's?

31:16.081 --> 31:18.616
I never asked. She once told
me that her sister had it.

31:18.650 --> 31:20.618
We should have Maura do

Dalton was working on

31:23.021 --> 31:25.656
- at the time of her death?
- She was conducting drug trials.

31:25.690 --> 31:27.891
She was determined to find
a cure for Huntington's.

why Dr. Dalton would be

<i>I have no idea.</i>

31:38.470 --> 31:42.172
These don't have anything
to do with her research.

31:42.207 --> 31:44.508
Is there any reason that she
would be collecting samples

31:44.542 --> 31:47.144

31:47.178 --> 31:48.579
Well, that's the group
that she was focused on,

31:48.613 --> 31:51.148
but the only way to detect
Huntington's is with a blood test.

31:51.182 --> 31:55.352
So all of her subjects were
adolescent boys ages 12 to 14?

31:55.387 --> 31:58.422
Yes. She said she wanted
to study juveniles.

31:58.456 --> 32:00.758

- but the computer's gone.
- Well, whoever tossed her apartment

32:24.082 --> 32:25.916
probably had something
to do with the murder.

32:25.984 --> 32:29.119
We'll pack everything up. The
killer might have missed something.

32:29.154 --> 32:31.679
- Okay, that's a lot of helmet pads.
- What?

32:31.714 --> 32:34.158
Used no-drip helmet pads
... hundreds of them.

32:36.961 --> 32:41.231
<i>Jane: So, Carla did drug trials
in Miami, Annapolis, Houston,</i>

32:41.266 --> 32:42.366
Corpus Christi, Portland,

32:42.434 --> 32:44.401
Seattle, and Boston,
which is the same places

32:44.469 --> 32:46.737
that she collected the
sweaty helmet pads for.

32:46.771 --> 32:48.906
And every city she
picked was near an ocean.

32:48.940 --> 32:53.711
Yeah.
She was focused on three things ...

32:53.778 --> 32:56.947
12- to 14-year-old
male hockey players,

32:56.981 --> 32:59.917
Huntington's disease,
and coastal cities.

33:02.821 --> 33:04.955
<i>She was looking for somebody ...</i>

33:04.989 --> 33:07.191
someone connected to these three things.

33:07.225 --> 33:11.762
So, Dr. Carla Dalton did not have
the genetic marker for Huntington's.

33:11.796 --> 33:15.265
What do you make of her
data from her drug trials?

33:15.333 --> 33:18.736
Well, let's see.

33:18.803 --> 33:21.472
The research subjects are all anonymous.

33:21.506 --> 33:25.642
They all have a number and
identifying information, like this.

33:25.677 --> 33:28.445
The subject is a
13-year-old boy from Boston

33:28.513 --> 33:30.447
who likes skateboarding
and science fiction.

33:30.515 --> 33:34.618
Okay. Why is this boy circled?
14-year-old from Boston.

33:34.652 --> 33:37.855
Enjoys hockey and sailing.
Where are the helmet pads from Boston?

33:37.889 --> 33:39.656
Not much use. They were
in the trunk of her car.

33:39.691 --> 33:42.459
Hmm, how odd ... she was running DNA

33:42.494 --> 33:44.995
she extracted from
sweat in the helmet pads

33:45.029 --> 33:47.631
against DNA from her
Huntington's test subjects.

33:47.699 --> 33:49.967
<i>And this is even odder.</i>

33:50.001 --> 33:52.369
- What? - She's comparing the
results to her own DNA.

33:52.437 --> 33:55.072
I got more info on Carla Dalton.

33:55.106 --> 33:56.774
She was originally from
Newport, Rhode Island.

33:56.841 --> 33:58.776
CSRU is pulling prints
from the submerged car

33:58.843 --> 34:01.645
to compare to the 65 people
you and Frankie interviewed.

34:01.679 --> 34:03.647
Well, how did you get the
prints from the parents

34:03.681 --> 34:04.922
and the rink employees?

34:04.923 --> 34:06.784
Jane had them all handle
a photo of the victim.

34:06.818 --> 34:08.051
Hmm. Genius.

34:08.085 --> 34:11.522
There's a date engraved
on this sailboat charm.

34:11.556 --> 34:13.524
July 17, 2001.

34:13.558 --> 34:17.194
July 17th.
Hang on. I just saw that.

34:17.228 --> 34:19.362
Frost, bring up Carla's
phone records for July 17th.

34:19.397 --> 34:21.532
Did she call anyone?

34:21.565 --> 34:25.202
A few Boston numbers and
a call to Rhode Island.

34:26.905 --> 34:28.472
Go back a year.

34:31.275 --> 34:32.842
She called the same
Rhode Island number.

34:32.877 --> 34:34.844
Go back another year.

34:36.147 --> 34:39.850
- There it is again.
- Run it.

34:39.884 --> 34:43.520
It's registered to a Jonathan McKnight.

34:43.554 --> 34:45.322
[ dialing ] Yes, hello.

34:45.356 --> 34:49.359
This is Detective Jane
Rizzoli from Boston homicide.

34:49.393 --> 34:50.960
Oh, you are?

34:50.995 --> 34:56.632
Well, we're investigating the
murder of Dr. Carla Dalton.

34:56.668 --> 34:59.269
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that.

34:59.337 --> 35:02.873
Uh, yes. Yeah, tomorrow
morning would be fine.

35:02.907 --> 35:05.876
Okay.
Thank you very much, Sergeant.

35:05.944 --> 35:07.211
[ beep ] Sergeant?

35:07.245 --> 35:09.513
Jonathan McKnight is a
retired homicide Detective.

35:09.581 --> 35:11.281
He knew Carla, and he wants
to talk to us tomorrow.

35:21.433 --> 35:23.934
I always worried that
Carla was right ...

35:23.969 --> 35:26.637
this is how it would end.

35:26.671 --> 35:33.277
- How... what would end?
- I met Carla 12 years ago.

35:34.779 --> 35:36.947
This is Carla with her sister, Bridget.

35:36.982 --> 35:43.153
Bridget, her husband, Michael,
and their 2-year-old son, Todd.

35:43.188 --> 35:46.290
All died in a boating
accident, July 17, 2001.

35:46.324 --> 35:48.826
Well, wait. You're a
retired homicide Detective.

35:48.860 --> 35:50.995
Why would you be investigating
a boating accident?

35:51.029 --> 35:53.597
Carla was convinced
it wasn't an accident.

35:55.066 --> 35:58.502
- Did you find the bodies?
- Only Bridget's body washed up.

35:58.536 --> 36:00.304
- What was the cause of death?
- Drowning.

36:00.338 --> 36:02.206
And what did Carla think happened

36:02.240 --> 36:04.341
to her brother-in-law
and her nephew?

36:04.376 --> 36:05.643
She was convinced that
Michael killed his wife,

36:05.677 --> 36:07.311
faked his own death so
he could take their son.

36:08.380 --> 36:10.446
What did you think?

36:11.516 --> 36:13.517
That she didn't have any proof.

36:13.551 --> 36:16.987
Did Carla know if Michael
ever threatened her sister?

36:17.022 --> 36:18.455
She said there was
tension in the marriage,

36:18.490 --> 36:21.358
that ... that Bridget
had some terrible illness.

36:21.393 --> 36:23.127
- Huntington's disease.
- Yes, that's it.

36:23.161 --> 36:24.328
It's passed down from the mother.

36:24.362 --> 36:26.664
<i>Bridget's son has a 50/50
chance of inheriting it.</i>

36:26.698 --> 36:28.265
The intersecting circles.

36:29.334 --> 36:32.937
14-year-old boy who played
hockey and lived near the ocean.

36:33.004 --> 36:34.705
Carla was looking for her nephew.

36:34.739 --> 36:38.175
McKnight: Oh, yeah.
She was obsessed with finding Todd

36:38.209 --> 36:40.344
and bringing Michael to justice.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.047
I wanted to help her. I...

36:44.749 --> 36:48.419
There was nothing to go on.

36:48.453 --> 36:50.921
Why would Michael stage
a boating accident?

36:50.956 --> 36:53.724
I mean, there are easier ways
to leave your spouse and get custody.

36:53.758 --> 36:57.361
Well, after Michael's presumed drowning,
the investment firm he worked for

36:57.395 --> 37:00.664
said he was under investigation
for embezzling millions.

37:00.699 --> 37:03.233
So get rid of your wife,
take your son and the money,

37:03.268 --> 37:06.003
and no one will look
for you if you're dead.

37:06.037 --> 37:09.840
Did Michael have any
connection to hockey?

37:09.874 --> 37:12.509
He played semi-pro.
He was a real fanatic.

37:12.544 --> 37:13.811
He'd dress that boy in hockey shirts

37:13.845 --> 37:15.946
and had him on skates
as soon as he could walk.

37:15.981 --> 37:17.781
You never change your hobbies,

37:17.816 --> 37:21.251
and Michael had two of
them ... sailing and hockey.

37:21.286 --> 37:26.924
- Do you have Michael's prints on file?
- Michael Leahy. Right here.

37:32.497 --> 37:35.699
Frankie: This is
everyone we interviewed.

37:35.734 --> 37:38.135
That one.
Load that one up, Frankie.

37:41.072 --> 37:42.539
Those are Michael
Leahy's prints, all right.

37:42.574 --> 37:45.976
Pull up the DMV photo
on the ones that match.

37:46.011 --> 37:48.545
Doug Pierce. You recognize him?

37:48.580 --> 37:49.847
Hmm. Maybe.

37:50.949 --> 37:53.083
Maura: He's had surgery.

37:53.118 --> 37:55.252
His eyes are similar
and so are his ears.

37:55.286 --> 37:57.254
This is the same man.

37:57.288 --> 37:59.490
So Doug Pierce is Michael Leahy.

38:01.393 --> 38:02.860
We got him.

38:06.464 --> 38:07.931
<i>Doug Pierce remarried,</i>

38:07.966 --> 38:11.068
I bet wife number two has no idea
he murdered wife number one.

38:11.102 --> 38:12.202
He keeps a low profile.

38:12.270 --> 38:14.671
Works as an investment
adviser from his home.

38:14.706 --> 38:16.106
I sent uniforms, but he won't be there.

38:16.141 --> 38:19.209
- Guy's on the run.
- Okay. All right, thanks.

38:19.244 --> 38:22.046
His son, who has perfect attendance,
didn't go to school today.

38:23.214 --> 38:26.316
Why would he voluntarily come
in and do an interview with me?

38:26.351 --> 38:28.352
I remember Doug Pierce.
He was calm.

38:28.386 --> 38:29.520
Well, he was buying time.

38:29.554 --> 38:31.522
If he didn't show up,
we'd know it was him.

38:31.556 --> 38:34.792
This way, he keeps us investigating,
and he gets a head start.

38:34.826 --> 38:36.093
He knows we've got him on
a watch list at the airport.

38:36.127 --> 38:39.163
Do a search. See if Doug Pierce
is a registered boat owner.

38:41.433 --> 38:42.633
[ keyboard clacking ]

38:44.903 --> 38:46.637
<i>What do you know?</i>

38:46.671 --> 38:50.140
- You're not going with us.
- Yes, I am.

38:50.175 --> 38:51.442
What are you gonna do
if he starts to run?

38:51.476 --> 38:53.610
Hobble.

38:54.913 --> 38:56.580
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:58.683 --> 39:02.219
<i>- Luke: This is gonna be awesome.
- Sheila: Yeah. Not much wind.</i>

39:02.253 --> 39:06.056
- No sign of Michael.
- The hatch is open. He's down below.

39:06.091 --> 39:10.060
Frankie, get the kid and the
wife off, fast as you can. Ready?

39:10.095 --> 39:12.262
Boston police!
Get off the boat!

39:12.297 --> 39:14.698
- Why?
- Step off the boat, Mrs. Pierce.

39:14.766 --> 39:16.700
- Wait. What's going on?
- Mom ...

39:16.768 --> 39:17.868
- Luke, come on.
- You, too. Come on.

39:17.902 --> 39:19.369
<i>Okay. Go, go, go.
Let's go. Come on.</i>

39:20.271 --> 39:23.574
- Don't move.
- It's over, Michael.

39:26.111 --> 39:28.946
Michael? What?
You have the wrong man.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.180
Carla saw you at the ice rink?

39:30.215 --> 39:32.449
Or did you go after
her after you saw her?

39:35.353 --> 39:41.692
- You saw her.
- Why couldn't she just let me be?

39:44.863 --> 39:47.030
<i>She was watching the game,
wasn't she?</i>

39:47.065 --> 39:49.633
Hoping one of those boys was her nephew.

39:49.701 --> 39:50.701
<i>[ cheers and applause ]
Oh! Whoo!</i>

39:50.768 --> 39:52.136
<i>Like a freaking bloodhound.</i>

<i>12 years later, she tracks me down,</i>

son's game, wrecking my life.

40:02.046 --> 40:06.383
<i>Just like her damn sister.</i>

40:06.417 --> 40:08.952
<i>You know how she found you?</i>

40:08.987 --> 40:11.188
You signed your son
up for her drug trial.

40:11.256 --> 40:14.591
Five years she spent comparing
her DNA to hundreds of boys

40:14.626 --> 40:16.360
trying to find her sister's son.

40:16.394 --> 40:17.394
While also trying to find
a cure for Huntington's.

40:17.462 --> 40:18.595
Now, that's a good person.

40:18.630 --> 40:20.597
Dad, why are they talking
about Huntington's?

40:20.632 --> 40:24.268
- How do they know?
- Sheila, get Luke the hell out of here.

40:24.302 --> 40:26.303
No, dad, what's happening?
Who's Carla?

40:26.337 --> 40:27.871
What did you tell him when
he cried out for his mother?

40:27.906 --> 40:29.239
His mother?
She abandoned him.

40:29.274 --> 40:31.041
I am his mother.

40:31.075 --> 40:33.443
Sheila, shut up
and get him the hell out of here!

<i>Come on. No, dad ...</i>

- Michael Leahy, you are under arrest
- Dad! Dad!

and Bridget Dalton Leahy.

40:45.623 --> 40:49.560
I can still hear that
poor kid yelling, "dad!"

40:49.627 --> 40:54.431
Carla was so close.
So tragic.

40:54.465 --> 40:57.067
But it's beautiful, too, how
much she loved her sister.

40:57.135 --> 40:59.403

40:59.437 --> 41:01.705
- Hey.
- Hey.

I'm guessing you're not gonna
offer me a glass of wine.

41:07.845 --> 41:09.813
We could pretend it's France.

41:09.847 --> 41:12.382
It's okay. I got a guy
that can buy me a six-pack.

41:13.484 --> 41:17.521
- I'm kidding.
- I hear you're a good cook.

41:17.555 --> 41:19.723
Yeah. You want me
to make you something?

41:19.791 --> 41:21.291
Are you planning to
clean up after yourself?

41:21.326 --> 41:23.326
Is that part of the deal?

41:25.663 --> 41:29.800
- No.
- We could order takeout.

41:29.867 --> 41:31.313
You could help me throw
out the boxes.
