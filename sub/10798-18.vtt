ln the beginning,
uh, a little bit of each.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.968
Now, after 300 years,

30:05.178 --> 30:07.554
the entire concept
of sexual reproduction

30:07.764 --> 30:10.599
is a little repugnant to us.

30:12.185 --> 30:15.729
Well, how did you overcome
the problem of replicative fading?

30:16.523 --> 30:17.648
We haven't.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.818
You have got a problem.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.946
Wait, l don't understand
replicative fading.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.908
Each time you clone,
you're making a copy of a copy.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.701
Subtle errors creep
into the chromosomes

30:29.911 --> 30:32.412
and eventually you end up
with a non-viable clone.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.414
How can we help you?

30:34.624 --> 30:37.000
We need an infusion of fresh DNA.

30:37.210 --> 30:41.839
l was hoping that you would be willing
to share some tissue samples.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.093
You want to clone us?

30:47.220 --> 30:48.846
Yes.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.597
No way. Not me.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.100
But how could
you possibly be harmed?

30:53.309 --> 30:55.936
lt's not a question of harm.

30:56.145 --> 31:00.232
One William Riker is unique,
perhaps even special.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.276
But a hundred of him,
a thousand of him,

31:02.485 --> 31:05.070
diminishes me in ways
l can't even imagine.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.739
You would be preserving yourself.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.617
Human beings have other ways
of doing that.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.744
We have children.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.508
l think you will find
that attitude prevalent

31:26.718 --> 31:29.303
among all the Enterprise people.

31:30.471 --> 31:32.264

31:34.017 --> 31:39.521
Well, if you are not willing
to share your DNA,

31:39.731 --> 31:43.066

repair our malfunctioning equipment?

31:43.276 --> 31:46.236
Yes, of course. Number One,

Captain, with your permission,
l would like to return to the planet.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.794
lt could be my last opportunity
to study replicative fading.

32:03.004 --> 32:06.089
Uh, with your permission, of course,
Mr. Prime Minister.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.799
You would be most welcome.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.719
Perhaps you will find a solution
that we have overlooked.

32:11.429 --> 32:15.307
Well, l appreciate the compliment
but l don't think that's very likely.

32:15.516 --> 32:21.063
And repairing that equipment
will certainly not solve your problems.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.274
What other solution do we have?

ofEnterprise technicians.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.259
The repairs are almost complete.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.220

we could do.

32:53.429 --> 32:55.430

- Yeah.

Every time l asked where you were,
some clone lied to me.

34:17.388 --> 34:20.015
Commander, with this l can see better
than your average person.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.852
Now, when someone lies, there are
certain physiological manifestations.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.898
Variations in blush response,
pupil dilation, pulse, breath rate.

lt doesn't always work with aliens,
but humans? l've got them nailed.

- Now wait a minute.

34:42.997 --> 34:45.457

35:04.310 --> 35:05.727

35:05.937 --> 35:07.854
that you're not missing
any epithelial cells.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.899

- Will and l, however, are.

35:11.526 --> 35:12.651

35:12.860 --> 35:15.112
Although you can clone
from any cell in the body,

35:15.321 --> 35:17.280
the cells lining the stomach
are the best choice

35:17.490 --> 35:20.367

undifferentiated.

We certainly have a right to exercise

Are you saying we should give them
the DNA samples they require?

37:47.932 --> 37:50.058
That's just postponing the inevitable.

lf they get an infusion
of fresh DNA,

37:52.770 --> 37:56.231
in 1 5 generations they'll just go back
to the same problems.

37:57.400 --> 38:02.112

38:07.451 --> 38:09.452

- Yes.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.288

the carnal side of our nature.

How can we learn to put that aside?

40:39.103 --> 40:43.815
Well, ahem, you put
a young couple together

40:44.024 --> 40:47.819

your society too.

the healthier and the safer the society.
