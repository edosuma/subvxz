00:22.544 --> 00:25.958
- This frog is trying
to tell us something.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.699
So is this one.

00:27.723 --> 00:31.877
Significant abnormalities
were also found in Wisconsin,

00:31.901 --> 00:33.139
Missouri, and New York.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.923
- There's something
in the water.

00:34.947 --> 00:38.623
- A hot spot induced
deformities in 75 to 100%

00:38.647 --> 00:40.451
of the frogs.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.887
- Pollution officials was asked
if she would drink the water

00:41.911 --> 00:43.236
and she said "no".

00:43.260 --> 00:44.933
- It could be only
a matter of time

00:44.957 --> 00:48.352
before other species are
affected, including humans.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.897
- Okay.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.290
Here we go.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.532
Lake Superior.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.385
It's the biggest one.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.689
It goes all the
way to the ocean.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.552
Come on, kiddo, you don't
get to see that in LA.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.875
Look, I know this
move is not your jam

02:40.899 --> 02:43.574
but once your grandpa
has his surgery

02:43.598 --> 02:45.513
and he's feeling
better, we can leave.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.317
- We're broke.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.341
How can we leave?

02:50.474 --> 02:53.434
- If we hate it, we will
find a way to leave.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.306
- What if only I hate it?

02:58.352 --> 03:01.374
- Well, I guess you'll
have to suck it.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.705
Gosh, oh, I love this song.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.417
- Hey!

04:27.441 --> 04:28.616
- Whoa, cool dog.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.552
- I bet that's Kinky.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.119
- Hey, Kinky.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.363
Is that the outhouse?

04:39.496 --> 04:40.496
- Yeah.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.823
- It's nasty.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.022
- Hey!

04:47.330 --> 04:48.786
Would you rather go...

04:48.810 --> 04:49.810
- In a bucket?

04:52.335 --> 04:53.641
- It's a triple flusher.

04:56.644 --> 04:57.644
- Hey, Pops.

04:59.908 --> 05:00.908
- Oh.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.114
Hey, Brody.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.507
I'm your grandpa.

05:14.531 --> 05:15.987
Grand daddy.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.728
Pah poo.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.165
Ah, hell, that all makes me
sound like a dry old fart.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.538
You can just call me Chuck.

05:24.715 --> 05:28.173
Hey, around here whether
you've come out of the crapper

05:28.197 --> 05:31.026
or just cleaned some fish
guts, men shake hands.

05:32.723 --> 05:35.659
Ah, yeah, okay, okay,
I'll wash first.

05:38.599 --> 05:39.599
Ah, there you go.

05:52.743 --> 05:53.918
Home sweet home.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.054
Welcome.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.863
Anything changed?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.367
It's still the same old place.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.544
- Man.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.525
Ma always loved this.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.875
- There's a lot of
dead animals here.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.311
- Oh, yeah.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.660
- Yeah, Pops loves
his dead animals.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.227
- Well, who's up
for a little swim?

06:22.251 --> 06:24.055
We can get our suits on,
head down to the lake.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.079
What do you think?

07:05.468 --> 07:06.314
- What?

07:06.338 --> 07:07.338
It's just a frog.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.799
- Watch out, watch out.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.322
What's going on, guys?

07:14.346 --> 07:16.107
- It was a frog.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.456
And it's all messed up.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.153
- What should we do, Miss Eva?

07:19.177 --> 07:20.459
- Show 'em to someone.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.982
Right?

07:22.006 --> 07:23.446
- Hey, there's another
one over here.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.634
- Holy shit.

07:42.418 --> 07:45.160
- Hey, Chuck, when we get back,
can I use your computer?

07:46.161 --> 07:47.573
- Computer?

07:47.597 --> 07:50.010
Don't believe I'm
familiar with that term.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.034
- Oh, god.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.322
- Oh, now, don't get
her too tired out.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.346
She's pregnant.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.217
- Really?

08:01.176 --> 08:02.632
- Puppies.

08:02.656 --> 08:03.546
- Ha!

08:03.570 --> 08:05.267
You hear that, Brody?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.639
Hey, what's going
on with the town?

08:09.663 --> 08:10.663
It seems...

08:12.100 --> 08:14.165
I don't know, like it's
not doing so good.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.365
- Well, most kids leave.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.866
Graduate high school,
why stick around?

08:19.890 --> 08:22.826
Unless you want to
work in pesticides.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.567
- Pesticides?

08:24.591 --> 08:27.221
- Hey, Brody, what do you
want to be when you grow up?

08:27.245 --> 08:30.964
- Well, I was thinking...

08:30.988 --> 08:32.120
What was that?

08:33.121 --> 08:34.140
- Uh oh.

08:34.164 --> 08:35.253
It's the granddaddy carp.

08:36.732 --> 08:38.015
He's as big as a canoe.

08:39.256 --> 08:40.389
- You city kid.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.157
- Fuck, fuck!

10:08.520 --> 10:09.520
Fuck.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.378
- We found three.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.403
There might be more.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.600
- Jesus.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.210
- Could I see?

10:26.234 --> 10:28.255
- Where did you find these?

10:28.279 --> 10:30.867
- In the woods over
there by the pond.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.346
- Ugh.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.653
Dad, that's, that's real
close to the house.

10:34.677 --> 10:35.828
- Yeah, it's just frogs.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.787
Freaks of nature.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.292
- What's this?

10:43.555 --> 10:46.752
You, uh, joining the
Girl Scouts, Chuck?

10:46.776 --> 10:47.776
- Hiya, guys.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.582
How's Judy?

10:50.606 --> 10:52.323
- Due in a couple of weeks.

10:52.347 --> 10:53.696
I'm ready for it to be over.

10:55.785 --> 10:56.893
Who's this?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.353
- My daughter, Kim.

11:00.877 --> 11:01.985
- Oh, yeah.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.247
Kim Sweet.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.601
- Remember that?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.516
- Sam, Larry, guys, come on.
- Just, just messing with her.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.672
- Hey, come on, come on.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.302
What's in the box?

11:15.326 --> 11:17.111
- Some deformed frogs we found.

11:18.373 --> 11:19.176
- Ew.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.612
- Hey!

11:20.636 --> 11:22.156
- Put those things
out of their misery.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.356
Some things just
aren't meant to be.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.618
- Survival of the fittest.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.793
Hey, kids?

11:29.732 --> 11:31.101
- Put that away.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.320
Come on, these kids are little.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.279
Is it even hunting season?

11:35.303 --> 11:37.455
- No, it's not.

11:37.479 --> 11:38.479
- Sorry.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.980
- Sorry, Kids.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.242
I think we're gonna have to
skip the rest of the hike.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.266
We should head back.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.856
- Hey, you're gonna show
those to somebody, right?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.684
- Yeah, I'll show
them to Mr. Douglas,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.860
the science teacher
over at Birchwood.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.600
- Good.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.951
- Alright, you have a nice
hike back and be careful.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.344
Even though there's
no hunting here,

11:57.368 --> 11:59.849
somehow it creeps in
from time to time.

12:03.853 --> 12:04.898
- Wait up, guys.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.894
- Come in.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.765
- Hi, Mr. Douglas.

12:26.789 --> 12:27.789
- Hi, Eva.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.488
- I have something
you should see.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.813
- Oh, hell, it ain't that bad.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.293
Come on.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.773
Look, you see those
weird handprints there?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.321
That's your mom's hands
when she was your age.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.996
- What's up with that thing?

13:24.020 --> 13:25.868
- Oh, never mind
that old pervert.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.260
He won't bite.

13:27.284 --> 13:30.810
But be careful, his
eyes might wander.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.791
- You know, I think I might
just go in the winter bucket.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.835
- Yeah?

13:36.859 --> 13:37.939
You're the one cleaning it.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.822
All mine.

13:52.701 --> 13:53.833
- Doesn't look so bad.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.857
- Why can't you
just homeschool me?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.317
- Brody, I gotta work.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.383
- Well, then why can't
Chuck homeschool me?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.081
- You kidding?

14:05.105 --> 14:07.344
That'd be like having a
cereal box homeschool you.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.345
Come on.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.369
It'll be fun.

14:10.023 --> 14:10.913
You'll make new friends.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.610
- I had friends.

14:12.634 --> 14:13.634
- You'll get more.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.296
- Dad, can you, can
you turn that off?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.037
- Oh, but it's so great though.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.342
I'm so proud of you.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.977
That's why I kept
all this stuff.

14:51.934 --> 14:52.934
- Yeah, just...

14:54.763 --> 14:55.895
Can you turn it off please?

14:56.939 --> 14:57.960
- Wait, wait, wait.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.222
This is my favorite part.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.685
- I know but it's just...

15:04.773 --> 15:07.297
I can't fucking watch that shit.

15:17.307 --> 15:22.312
I don't want that
to be who I am.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.186
- Alright.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.277
Who do you want to be?

15:38.850 --> 15:39.939
- I don't know.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.726
Just not a fuck up.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.710
- You're into superheroes.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.973
Amphibious mutant
ninjas and all that?

15:54.997 --> 15:55.997
Right?

15:57.565 --> 15:59.685
Well, how do you think that
could happen in real life?

16:01.482 --> 16:02.546
Benny?

16:02.570 --> 16:04.504
- Toxic waste.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.116
- Well, that's always
a possibility.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.970
These extremely deformed frogs
were recently found nearby.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.646
Pollution, parasites,
pesticides,

16:15.670 --> 16:18.368
even UV rays have all been
culprits in the past.

16:19.804 --> 16:23.480
We will attempt to determine
what this cause may be.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.504
Sound like fun?

16:26.376 --> 16:27.376
It will be.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.140
- And a search for a
missing Itasca county boy,

16:31.164 --> 16:33.142
12-year-old Jonah Anderson...

16:35.603 --> 16:38.147
For a hike in nearby
Riverside Park.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.018
Given the park runs
along the Mississippi,

16:40.042 --> 16:41.933
search crews are
also sweeping...

16:45.308 --> 16:47.504
Recently said they are
following every tip

16:47.528 --> 16:49.027
and every connection possible

16:49.051 --> 16:50.879
to bring the 12-year-old
home safely.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.423
- There you go.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.467
- After apparently being exposed

16:54.491 --> 16:55.816
to liquid propane vapors...

16:55.840 --> 16:57.557
- Slide it right in.

16:57.581 --> 16:58.515
- St. Louis county
sheriff's office says...

16:58.539 --> 16:59.995
- There you go.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.300
- Dad!

17:01.324 --> 17:02.499
What the hell?

17:03.935 --> 17:05.608
- Uh, and of course
never mess with guns

17:05.633 --> 17:07.287
unless an adult is present.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.221
Whew.

17:09.244 --> 17:10.353
- He's still a kid.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.744
- The police are still searching

17:11.769 --> 17:13.398
for Jonah Anderson,
the 12-year-old boy

17:13.423 --> 17:16.098
that went missing from Grand
Rapids five days ago.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.709
He reportedly went
alone on a nature...

17:18.733 --> 17:20.145
- Well, I don't want him
going to a gunfight

17:20.169 --> 17:22.191
with a wet noodle in his pocket.

17:22.214 --> 17:24.019
- I don't even know
what that means.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.914
There are no gun
fights in his future.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.850
Listen, there's some
kind of, I don't know,

17:29.874 --> 17:33.202
half chewed up deer on
the side of the drive.

17:33.226 --> 17:36.838
- Eh, it's probably just road
kill but let's go take a look.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.153
- I don't get it.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.177
Where is it?

18:14.180 --> 18:17.183
I mean it, it was
right around here.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.447
- Maybe it's further over.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.078
- Maybe.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.844
- Maybe it was injured
and limped away.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.196
- Oh, wait, Mom,
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.391
Look.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.305
- Another one?

18:33.329 --> 18:34.524
- Another two.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.438
- Jesus.

18:35.462 --> 18:36.462
- Whoa.

18:37.812 --> 18:38.812
See?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.120
He's all fucked up.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.752
- There is a normal deformity
rate among amphibians

18:45.776 --> 18:49.713
but if there are more,
say if it goes above 2%,

18:49.737 --> 18:51.454
it can be cause for alarm.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.108
There's actually some reports

18:53.132 --> 18:54.805
of deformed frogs being
found upstate a while back.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.154
- Really?

18:56.178 --> 18:56.981
- Mm-hm.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.374
- How many?

18:58.398 --> 19:00.051
- Not a ton but enough
to get noticed.

19:01.705 --> 19:02.837
- Well, what causes it?

19:04.578 --> 19:06.860
- Nobody really knows.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.277
It's something in the water.

19:10.061 --> 19:13.171
You know, the problem is they're
not as cute as dolphins

19:13.195 --> 19:14.370
so nobody seems to care.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.306
Huh, buddy?

19:17.330 --> 19:20.855
- So in relatively small
numbers it's okay.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.118
- Well, not necessarily.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.968
Frogs literally soak up
their environment, right?

19:27.992 --> 19:30.493
They can be wonderful
indicators of what's...

19:31.344 --> 19:32.973
Yes?

19:32.997 --> 19:34.497
- Excuse me, Trent.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.629
I have those lab permission
forms you wanted.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.500
- Oh, yeah.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.154
Thank you, Sandy.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.287
Um, this is one of my
student's mothers, Kim Sweet.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.332
- Hey.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.748
- The Kim Sweet?

19:47.098 --> 19:50.014
- Uh, well, a Kim Sweet.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.515
It's nice to meet you.

19:52.539 --> 19:53.539
- Pleasure.

19:54.497 --> 19:55.822
I'll talk to you later, Trent.

19:55.846 --> 19:56.846
- Thank you, Sandy.

20:00.111 --> 20:04.048
Uh, the Kim Sweet?

20:04.072 --> 20:05.072
- Yeah.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.878
I kinda had this, like,

20:07.902 --> 20:10.315
itty bitty pop music career,
like, a million years ago

20:10.339 --> 20:11.534
but it's not important.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.798
We don't have to talk about it.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.016
- Okay.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.583
Maybe some other time.

20:17.607 --> 20:18.607
- Yeah.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.545
- You know, for now
I would concentrate

20:22.569 --> 20:24.503
on how many more deformed
frogs you can find

20:24.527 --> 20:27.051
on your property and look
for signs of pollution.

20:28.183 --> 20:32.187
- Like fast food
wrappers or chemicals?

20:33.275 --> 20:34.275
- Chemicals.

20:35.799 --> 20:39.083
- But since this kind of thing
only happens to animals

20:39.107 --> 20:41.544
that live near the
water, we're good.

20:43.503 --> 20:47.724
- Kim, we are animals
that live near the water.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.159
- Can we go swimming?

21:12.183 --> 21:13.183
This is boring.

21:14.882 --> 21:15.728
- Oh, damn, boy.

21:15.752 --> 21:16.752
Give it a chance.

21:18.233 --> 21:21.343
Besides, this water might
be bad for swimming.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.282
I want you to stay
out of it, you hear?

21:25.675 --> 21:27.436
- Then why are we...

21:27.460 --> 21:29.620
- Being on it and being in
it are two different things.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.469
- So it's safe to
eat fish from here?

21:37.905 --> 21:40.168
- Oh, you don't catch no
fish in this lake anyway.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.302
- Then why are we fishing?

21:45.478 --> 21:49.762
- It's not about the fish,
it's about the experience.

21:49.786 --> 21:52.093
- Experience of not
catching fish.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.446
- You'll understand
when you get older.

22:02.364 --> 22:05.106
Uh, what did you and
your friends do for fun?

22:07.021 --> 22:09.806
- Comic books, skateboarding,
online gaming.

22:13.462 --> 22:16.136
- Yeah, we might not have
much of that around here

22:16.160 --> 22:19.705
but we got each other.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.861
We got family.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.405
That's what it's all about.

22:23.429 --> 22:26.146
We take care of each
other no matter what.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.540
So, what do you want to
be when you grow up?

22:28.564 --> 22:29.454
Aw!

22:29.478 --> 22:30.914
Friggin' son of a...

22:31.872 --> 22:33.284
Look at that.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.354
Made in China bull crap.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.442
Well...

22:49.672 --> 22:52.695
- So what do you think about
those people disappearing?

22:52.719 --> 22:55.524
- Well, that all happened an
hour or two north of here

22:55.548 --> 22:57.550
so it's nothing you
need to worry about.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.621
- There was a kid who went
missing about my age.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.405
Think they'll find him?

23:07.429 --> 23:08.778
- I'm sure they will.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.230
No, it's yours.

23:27.623 --> 23:28.623
- Seriously?

23:30.713 --> 23:31.713
Wow, thanks, Chuck.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.111
- Always comes in handy.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.941
Yeah, I guess we
could head back.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.343
Hey, do me a favor, huh?

24:16.367 --> 24:17.456
Don't tell your mom.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.329
I don't want her to think
it's any worse than it is.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.396
- Uh, do you want me to...

24:25.420 --> 24:26.484
- No, no, no, no.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.508
I got it.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.559
- What, you don't like
boats with motors?

24:34.516 --> 24:35.778
- I am the motor.

24:37.911 --> 24:38.911
Ready?

24:39.695 --> 24:40.695
Varoom.

24:47.790 --> 24:48.724
- You really think
we're gonna find more

24:48.748 --> 24:49.748
of these mutant things?

24:51.402 --> 24:53.666
- The kids keep calling me
to find out what happened.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.889
Mr. Douglas said it would be
a huge help if I found more.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.543
- Okey dokey.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.785
- What are you doing?

25:06.809 --> 25:09.484
- If you want to catch a frog,
you gotta think like a frog.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.920
Ribbit!

25:10.944 --> 25:12.008
- I appreciate that
but just so you know,

25:12.032 --> 25:13.163
I won't be joining you.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.689
- Come on, give me a hand.

25:21.694 --> 25:22.694
Oh, shit.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.150
Oh, crap.

25:24.174 --> 25:25.761
- My savior!

25:25.785 --> 25:26.675
Ugh.

25:26.699 --> 25:27.806
- Oh, gosh.

25:27.830 --> 25:28.981
Ugh.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.592
Oh, crap.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.158
- What?

25:32.182 --> 25:33.856
- I think I lost my shoe.

25:33.880 --> 25:34.944
- Well, come on.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.249
- I'm actually kind of stuck.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.273
- Whatever.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.078
- Seriously.

25:39.102 --> 25:39.949
- Well, whatever.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.298
You're on your own.

25:41.322 --> 25:41.951
- Seriously, I think
I'm kind of...

25:41.975 --> 25:42.975
Come on.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.571
- What was that?

25:53.595 --> 25:54.901
- Uh, nature.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.425
Just nature.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.319
- In regional news,

26:02.343 --> 26:04.060
Grand Rapids officials
report no new leads

26:04.084 --> 26:07.280
in the case of Jonah Anderson
but search parties continue

26:07.304 --> 26:08.673
to look for the 12-year-old

26:08.697 --> 26:11.589
in the areas surrounding
Riverside Park.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.243
A young woman from
International Falls

26:13.267 --> 26:15.593
has now been officially
declared missing.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.639
The Crow Wing County Sheriff's
Department is searching

26:17.663 --> 26:20.119
for 34-year-old Tina Stevens

26:20.143 --> 26:21.643
who was last seen
heading to Black Lake

26:21.667 --> 26:24.471
to photograph wildlife
two weeks ago.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.952
Authorities found Miss
Steven's destroyed camera

26:26.976 --> 26:28.737
and signs of a
struggle in the area,

26:28.761 --> 26:33.766
leading them to
suspect foul play...

26:34.505 --> 26:35.505
In sports news...

27:16.286 --> 27:18.830
- The search for a missing
12-year-old boy continues

27:18.854 --> 27:20.005
near Grand Rapids.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.138
Still no clues
have been found...

27:22.162 --> 27:23.661
- Dad!

27:23.685 --> 27:24.270
- But local police
are considering...

27:24.294 --> 27:25.141
- Dad.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.795
Dad, shut it off.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.971
- Mayor Paulson of
Duluth addressed...

27:28.995 --> 27:29.995
- Pesticides.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.520
It totally makes sense.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.499
- Pesticides.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.240
- Yeah, pesticides.

27:37.264 --> 27:38.894
You see how close we are to
all of these farms, right?

27:38.918 --> 27:40.460
Well, they spray all these
farms with pesticides,

27:40.484 --> 27:42.462
herbicides, that sort of thing.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.289
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:43.313 --> 27:44.987
So?

27:45.011 --> 27:46.728
- Yeah, so pesticide overspray
leaks into the lakes

27:46.752 --> 27:48.817
and the ponds and then bam!

27:48.841 --> 27:50.035
- Deformed frogs.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.059
- Exactly.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.779
- Okay, look, we don't
even know what kind of...

27:54.803 --> 27:56.022
- Well, let's go ask 'em.

27:58.807 --> 28:01.743
- Well, the closest farm
is owned by Larry Rogers

28:01.767 --> 28:03.832
who you met the other day.

28:03.856 --> 28:04.833
- Who?

28:04.857 --> 28:06.138
- Skunk slinger.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.226
- Perfect, he's a goon.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.488
Let's go.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.187
Where's Brody?

28:11.211 --> 28:12.971
- He's taking a shower.

28:12.995 --> 28:17.062
I mean, are you just looking
for something to fight for

28:17.086 --> 28:18.392
or against or...

28:19.567 --> 28:21.090
Keep out of the
water, we're fine.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.765
- Fine?

28:23.789 --> 28:25.869
You're willing to bet your
grandson's safety on fine?

28:27.662 --> 28:28.662
- No.

28:29.925 --> 28:30.859
Do you even know what
you're looking for?

28:30.883 --> 28:31.883
Not yet.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.516
- Do we have to
use boiled water?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.040
After a few minutes,
it's freezing.

28:38.064 --> 28:41.086
- Well, it's a clean,
safe shower, isn't it?

28:41.110 --> 28:42.218
- I don't know.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.442
Are these more winter toilets?

28:43.809 --> 28:44.699
- Ugh.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.048
- Oh, jeez, you guys.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.092
Shh, shh.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.248
- People need to be aware.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.922
Look out for your neighbors.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.750
Authorities in
International Falls

28:52.774 --> 28:55.884
and Grand Rapids believe
these are kidnappings

28:55.908 --> 28:59.322
and quite possibly related
to human trafficking.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.106
- The Mayor is still
encouraging people to...

29:01.130 --> 29:02.151
- Hey, Chuck?

29:02.175 --> 29:03.065
What's with the neighbors?

29:03.089 --> 29:03.805
- Neighbors?

29:03.829 --> 29:04.675
- Neighbors?

29:04.699 --> 29:05.632
We have neighbors?

29:05.656 --> 29:06.851
- Yeah, across the lake.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.026
That little deformed
girl with her dad.

29:08.050 --> 29:08.984
- Okay.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.899
Look, now, both of you.

29:10.923 --> 29:13.466
You stay clear of
them all together.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.859
- Christ, you're
practically a hermit.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.600
Who do you want to
be associated with?

29:16.624 --> 29:19.646
- Look, there've been
some bad rumors.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.431
- Seems safe with
the little girl.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.346
- Just stay away from them.

29:23.370 --> 29:26.349
If good fences make
good neighbors,

29:26.373 --> 29:28.549
then a whole lake makes
even better ones.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.618
- No.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.576
I should go with you, Kim,
I'm the science teacher.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.317
- No.

29:38.341 --> 29:39.623
Not gonna happen. He doesn't
even want to go with me.

29:39.647 --> 29:41.886
I just need to know
what to look for.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.279
- Okay.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.803
If it has anything to
do with pesticides,

29:45.827 --> 29:48.414
it would probably
involve Chloroprene.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.939
Chloroprene contains
synthetic retinoids.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.660
That's a derivative
of Vitamin A.

29:54.096 --> 29:57.597
- And that's the shit
that mutates the frogs?

29:57.621 --> 30:00.189
- Retinoids have been known to
cause severe birth defects,

30:01.451 --> 30:03.149
including limb malformation.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.303
- Limb malformation?

30:17.119 --> 30:18.923
- Oh, heya, Chuck.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.229
- Heya, Larry.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.360
- How ya doing?

30:21.384 --> 30:22.579
- Hey.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.059
Kim.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.974
- Oh, yeah, hey.

30:25.998 --> 30:26.998
Sweet.

30:28.565 --> 30:31.501
- Yeah, Kim's son's doing a
school report on farming

30:31.525 --> 30:35.157
and we were wondering if you
could show us what kind

30:35.181 --> 30:36.660
of pesticide you're spraying?

30:38.358 --> 30:39.446
- What is this, Chuck?

30:41.578 --> 30:43.861
- Look, she's living with me
now and with her young son.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.994
And she's concerned about safety

30:46.018 --> 30:48.324
with the pesticides
being used in the area.

30:50.674 --> 30:53.175
- Well, DDT was the nasty stuff

30:53.199 --> 30:56.395
but they, you know, they
banned that back in the 70s.

30:56.419 --> 30:59.007
I only use organic shit
from American Patriot.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.530
Well, not shit literally
but, you know.

31:00.554 --> 31:01.879
- Right, I got it.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.383
Can I just see the containers?

31:04.384 --> 31:05.752
- What?

31:05.776 --> 31:08.059
- Uh, what could be
the harm, you know,

31:08.083 --> 31:09.998
just to put her mind at ease?

31:11.173 --> 31:13.219
- My word should be good
enough for you, Chuck.

31:14.394 --> 31:15.743
- Good enough for the EPA?

31:23.098 --> 31:24.554
- I'm telling you, guys,
this is a waste of time.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.034
I ain't got nothing to hide.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.277
- Yeah? Then why don't
you show it to us?

31:29.409 --> 31:31.082
- Come on, Chuck.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.562
How long we been neighbors?

31:32.586 --> 31:34.564
Can't you at least come
back a little later?

31:34.588 --> 31:36.174
I'm right in the
middle of something.

31:36.198 --> 31:37.262
- You could just
show us right quick.

31:37.286 --> 31:38.592
We'll be out of your hair.

31:42.248 --> 31:43.225
- Fine.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.226
Wait.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.575
Wait here.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.402
I'll be right back.

31:46.426 --> 31:48.056
Wait.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.080
Wait here.

31:50.386 --> 31:51.320
- This is bullshit.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.408
He's hiding something.

31:52.432 --> 31:53.912
- No, Kim, don't...

32:09.449 --> 32:10.537
- Holy crap.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.733
You people actually exist?

32:13.757 --> 32:16.867
- It's, it's not, I don't...

32:16.891 --> 32:18.023
Don't judge.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.915
We're all consenting adults.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.005
- Yeah, no, it's, uh, oh.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.770
- No, that's just a friend.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.620
You know a thousand kids
is killed every year

32:30.644 --> 32:32.361
by household cleaning products.

32:32.385 --> 32:35.059
Why don't you go harass
those companies?

32:35.083 --> 32:36.974
- American Patriot Chemicals.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.304
All organic.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.133
No Chloroprene.

32:43.309 --> 32:46.636
- Well, uh, let's go, Kim.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.116
Sorry about this, Larry.

32:48.140 --> 32:49.140
- Yeah.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.511
Well, you know, while
you're here, you guys,

32:52.535 --> 32:54.320
you want to try something on?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.255
- Are you fucking nuts?

32:57.279 --> 32:58.126
- Okay!

32:58.150 --> 32:59.518
We'll be going.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.302
- Wait, wait, no,
wait, wait, wait.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.912
Wait a minute.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.306
Hey, is, is this all about
them mutated frogs?

33:04.330 --> 33:05.330
- Yeah.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.049
You seen 'em?

33:08.073 --> 33:11.487
- Yeah, I seen about, oh,
five, last couple days.

33:11.511 --> 33:12.511
- Where?

33:18.692 --> 33:19.886
- What are you doing?

33:19.910 --> 33:22.652
- Oh, uh, looking for frogs.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.460
So you live across
the lake, huh?

33:28.484 --> 33:29.485
- Yeah, with my dad.

33:32.532 --> 33:33.465
- Wanna help?

33:33.489 --> 33:34.379
- Sure.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.685
Want me to hold that?

33:35.709 --> 33:36.709
- Yeah, thanks.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.409
We're looking for any
frogs that are deformed.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.695
You know, frogs with
extra or missing legs.

33:45.719 --> 33:46.719
- How come?

33:48.113 --> 33:49.394
- Well, someone should be.

33:49.418 --> 33:52.030
Plus I think they're
kind of cool.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.533
Sorry about the kids at school.

33:57.557 --> 33:59.230
Total pricks.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.057
- It's okay.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.081
I'm used to it.

34:02.388 --> 34:03.278
- You think this water
could've done something

34:03.302 --> 34:04.888
to you and your dad?

34:04.912 --> 34:08.196
- My dad was born like
that, in New Jersey.

34:08.219 --> 34:09.219
Not here.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.659
- Are there always so
many snails out here?

34:14.878 --> 34:17.577
- So, Larry's working
on the ATV on a hill.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.208
Doesn't put it in gear,
rolls right into the lake.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.079
- Oh.

34:22.103 --> 34:22.906
- Again?

34:22.929 --> 34:23.929
- Again.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.650
- Can I take that down?

34:28.675 --> 34:30.217
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

34:30.242 --> 34:31.938
That must have happened tonight.

34:33.592 --> 34:35.571
Don't worry, Kim, you'll
win 'em over eventually.

34:41.775 --> 34:44.319
- Another exciting
Shirley Temple, please.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.606
- Oh, for the mother
to be, anything.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.150
- The search continues
near Hawksridge Park

34:49.174 --> 34:50.237
for 18-year-old Eva Johnson...

34:50.262 --> 34:51.978
- Hey.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.589
- And 19-year-old Derek
Novitzki who have been missing

34:53.612 --> 34:55.069
for four days now.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.506
Three days ago, Eva
Johnson's car was found

34:57.530 --> 34:59.880
in the parking lot of
Birchwood Elementary.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.033
- At this point we're
considering the disappearances

35:03.057 --> 35:04.861
to be tied into the
potential kidnappings

35:04.885 --> 35:07.429
that occurred in International
Falls and Grand Rapids.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.953
- Oh, sick bastards.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.259
- See?

35:11.283 --> 35:12.695
That's what I'm afraid of, Kim.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.392
Not frogs.

35:14.416 --> 35:17.134
- But it all started happening
about the same time.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.701
- Well, it was probably
the pesticides.

35:18.725 --> 35:19.658
I mean, you don't know
what the hell they put

35:19.682 --> 35:20.703
in the water these days.

35:20.727 --> 35:21.834
- No, hey, hey, don't, stop.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.184
Don't talk shit about something

35:23.208 --> 35:25.403
you don't know
anything about, okay?

35:25.427 --> 35:27.318
American Patriot's
been good to us.

35:27.342 --> 35:28.754
- You're drunk.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.408
- And that's what keeps
this town going.

35:30.432 --> 35:31.148
- Hey, Greg, what were you
and Sam talking about

35:31.172 --> 35:32.018
the other day?

35:32.042 --> 35:33.063
- Oh, here we go.

35:33.087 --> 35:34.847
- No, no, Judy, this is...

35:34.871 --> 35:37.154
There's this disfigured father
living with his daughter

35:37.178 --> 35:38.808
right across the lake
from Chuck and Sam.

35:38.832 --> 35:39.939
- Oh, right, right.

35:39.963 --> 35:41.637
That's that Joe Shit the ragman.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.378
I mean, he's the father.

35:43.402 --> 35:46.187
- Him and that nasty girl
bathing right in the lake.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.470
- And?

35:48.494 --> 35:49.471
- And?

35:49.495 --> 35:50.385
It's fucking gross.

35:50.409 --> 35:51.995
And it's dangerous.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.019
See this?

35:54.717 --> 35:58.306
We got into it real heavy on a
job site a couple years back.

35:58.330 --> 36:01.222
He said he'd scar the whole
town if he could find a way.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.247
Maybe he found a way.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.051
Who knows how those
people got kidnapped

36:05.075 --> 36:08.838
but if you ask me,
that freak did it.

36:08.862 --> 36:10.405
- Oh, Sam, you're drunk.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.320
- We got a monster
living across the lake.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.844
- Take it easy, take it easy.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.324
- Someone's gotta do something.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.348
- Alright.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.183
- Yeah, Edna.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.467
Well, no, no, I
lost track of time

36:29.491 --> 36:31.014
but she's still waiting there?

36:32.059 --> 36:32.862
My gosh.

36:32.886 --> 36:33.819
Uh, send her in.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.517
Send her in right away.

36:35.541 --> 36:36.541
Sorry.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.354
Miss Sweet, so sorry to,
uh, keep you waiting.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.616
Please have a seat.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.660
- Thank you for seeing me.

36:48.684 --> 36:49.705
- Of course.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.793
My pleasure.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.229
It's been a, been a busy day

36:52.253 --> 36:54.318
but they're all busy
days, aren't they?

36:54.342 --> 36:57.713
Yeah, now you are
somewhere here.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.236
I will find you.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.759
Here.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.152
Right.

37:02.176 --> 37:05.788
You have been making
some discoveries?

37:06.920 --> 37:11.664
- Yes, um, Mr. Mayor,
I'm a mother.

37:12.926 --> 37:16.079
I have a kid and there's
other mothers...

37:16.103 --> 37:17.559
- Deformed frogs?

37:17.583 --> 37:20.388
Miss Sweet, you found
some deformed frogs.

37:20.412 --> 37:21.412
That's it?

37:22.805 --> 37:24.305
- Yes.

37:24.329 --> 37:28.178
Um, and just because we
don't know of any ways

37:28.202 --> 37:30.857
in which it's affected humans
doesn't mean it hasn't.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.990
- Well, that's true that, uh,

37:35.383 --> 37:38.647
that is a legitimate concern
and I understand that.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.019
But I'm sure you'll
understand that right now

37:43.043 --> 37:45.915
my primary concern is finding
those missing teenagers.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.137
- Can't we do both?

37:55.490 --> 38:00.452
- Miss Sweet, this city
used to have a top rank

38:02.062 --> 38:05.587
in the entire country as a
place to raise children.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.525
- So don't you want
to tell people, like,

38:10.549 --> 38:15.138
stay out of the water or don't
eat local fish or something?

38:15.162 --> 38:17.947
I mean, what if it turns out
to be pesticide pollution?

38:22.387 --> 38:23.910
- Now why would you say that?

38:26.042 --> 38:28.673
- Well, just 'cause the local
pesticides are organic,

38:28.697 --> 38:32.658
does that mean they're safe
or they just sound safe?

38:34.486 --> 38:36.638
- Miss Sweet, I'm going
to ask you a question

38:36.662 --> 38:41.319
and please, I'd like you to
try to answer it honestly.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.346
In any part of this
are you trying

38:49.370 --> 38:51.764
to regain publicity
for yourself?

38:53.505 --> 38:55.396
- You think making
a bunch of noise

38:55.420 --> 38:58.790
about mutant frogs is gonna
reignite my pop career?

38:58.814 --> 39:00.531
- No.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.229
I'm just telling you what
other people might think.

39:03.253 --> 39:06.232
American Patriot Chemicals
have already been tested

39:06.256 --> 39:09.042
and approved by the EPA.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.217
That's a big deal.

39:12.872 --> 39:16.025
- Well, did they test it on
wildlife during fetal stages?

39:16.049 --> 39:19.115
- Farms in Northern
Minnesota are already using

39:19.139 --> 39:21.291
their pesticides,
their fertilizers.

39:21.315 --> 39:22.988
They love them.

39:23.012 --> 39:25.817
Local farms here have started
using them this spring

39:25.841 --> 39:27.471
to great success and
now we're going

39:27.495 --> 39:29.734
to start rolling them out
to surrounding states.

39:29.758 --> 39:31.151
It's a success story.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.522
- What if it hurts people?
Could you live with yourself?

39:34.546 --> 39:37.220
- Half of this state
is agricultural land.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.265
If you kick start a
premature scare,

39:39.289 --> 39:41.180
those farm families starve.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.815
And could you live
with yourself?

39:44.730 --> 39:46.645
- God, you're like
some movie mayor.

39:50.518 --> 39:53.671
Mr. Mayor, my dad's
property is in the middle

39:53.695 --> 39:55.499
of a bunch of these farms

39:55.523 --> 39:57.153
and on one of those farms they
found a ton of these frogs.

39:57.177 --> 39:59.397
Do you think that's
a coincidence?

40:00.572 --> 40:02.574
- And your science
degree is in what?

40:06.926 --> 40:11.409
- I'm working with a
local science teacher.

40:12.758 --> 40:13.691
- Uh huh.

40:13.715 --> 40:14.715
And who would that be?

40:16.065 --> 40:20.461
- Trent Douglas at Birchwood.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.464
- Elementary School?

40:24.509 --> 40:25.509
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:28.338 --> 40:29.338
Tell you what, Kim.

40:31.472 --> 40:35.278
Somebody bring me
some solid evidence

40:35.302 --> 40:38.194
that connects deformities
and the pesticides

40:38.218 --> 40:39.698
and I will take action.

40:40.873 --> 40:41.873
I promise you.

40:43.832 --> 40:46.618
Uh, you know, American
Patriot Chemicals

40:48.141 --> 40:49.945
is the biggest job
provider in the city

40:49.969 --> 40:51.468
and they pay a lot of taxes

40:51.492 --> 40:53.383
so I'm not gonna cause
any trouble for them

40:53.407 --> 40:55.951
without any probable cause.

40:55.975 --> 40:56.975
You understand?

40:57.759 --> 40:58.606
- Right.

40:58.630 --> 40:59.650
- Right.

40:59.674 --> 41:01.217
Thank you for dropping by.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.479
- Thank you.

41:02.503 --> 41:03.503
- Yes.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.222
- Hi.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.966
I would like to speak
to a reporter, please.

41:53.162 --> 41:54.923
- Okay, if I can just get
your name and number

41:54.947 --> 41:56.402
and what this is about,

41:56.426 --> 41:57.969
I can make sure that
someone will contact you

41:57.993 --> 41:59.536
if they feel it's newsworthy.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.016
- Okay.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.671
I've been finding these
deformed frogs, see?

42:03.695 --> 42:05.673
On my dad's property and
farms around there.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.805
- I know who you are.

42:07.829 --> 42:09.527
We're not giving
you any attention.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.553
- Look, I don't want
attention for me, I...

42:16.577 --> 42:21.427
- War, bad economy, no
jobs, missing kids,

42:21.451 --> 42:22.931
that's what people care about.

42:24.716 --> 42:27.869
I was at your going
away party fundraiser.

42:27.893 --> 42:29.808
I donated $20.

42:30.809 --> 42:32.526
Remember that?

42:32.550 --> 42:35.204
And now you want us to put
you back in the spotlight?

42:36.423 --> 42:38.009
- No, I...

42:38.033 --> 42:40.229
Look, see, this girl?

42:40.253 --> 42:42.579
She's the one who found
the deformed frogs.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.886
- Oh, what a coincidence.

42:44.910 --> 42:48.803
I guess you think I just
fell off the turnip truck.

42:48.827 --> 42:51.893
- Can you just do
your job, you know?

42:51.917 --> 42:54.156
Like just pick up the
phone and call somebody

42:54.180 --> 42:55.616
who's not a bitter old gash.

42:57.749 --> 42:58.749
- Security?

43:03.668 --> 43:04.930
And get a haircut.

43:24.776 --> 43:27.605
- The baked meat.

43:29.215 --> 43:30.520
It's fantastic.

43:32.131 --> 43:34.283
The maple syrup really makes it.

43:34.307 --> 43:35.414
- Really?

43:35.438 --> 43:36.438
- Oh, yeah.

43:38.790 --> 43:39.790
- Thank you.

43:46.536 --> 43:50.192
- Do you think she
wants some more?

43:51.324 --> 43:52.717
- No, I think she's alright.

43:53.935 --> 43:55.807
Her appetite isn't
what it used to be.

43:57.025 --> 43:59.158
Dementia's really
caught up with her.

44:03.205 --> 44:04.205
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.209
How long has she been like that?

44:09.603 --> 44:11.257
- Oh, two years now.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.149
It's tough.

44:14.173 --> 44:15.696
I wish I could do more for her.

44:17.176 --> 44:18.936
Can only afford to have a
home care nurse come by

44:18.960 --> 44:22.485
like once a day and even
that's putting us in the hole.

44:26.751 --> 44:28.622
- Well, I'm sure she
appreciates it.

44:31.016 --> 44:33.690
- I'll do whatever
I can for her.

44:33.714 --> 44:34.714
She's my mom.

44:38.414 --> 44:41.766
You want to, uh, you want to
go in the other room and talk?

44:43.550 --> 44:44.875
- Yeah.

44:44.899 --> 44:45.899
Sure.

44:46.901 --> 44:48.444
- Come on, Mom.

44:48.468 --> 44:49.948
Time to go to bed.

44:53.081 --> 44:55.407
- Seven more of these
deformed frogs today.

44:55.431 --> 44:56.713
Just today.

44:56.737 --> 44:58.454
And a shit ton of snails.

44:58.478 --> 45:00.586
Or so Brody says.

45:00.610 --> 45:01.544
- Did you say snails?

45:01.568 --> 45:03.024
- Yeah.

45:03.048 --> 45:05.766
A bunch of them all
around by the pond, why?

45:05.790 --> 45:08.401
- Snails can be major
carriers of parasites.

45:09.271 --> 45:10.271
- Parasites?

45:11.796 --> 45:13.667
Well, what brings
in all the snails?

45:14.886 --> 45:16.888
- Algae, plant growth.

45:19.804 --> 45:20.979
Why do you care so much?

45:22.415 --> 45:23.590
- Why wouldn't you care?

45:26.114 --> 45:28.551
- You know, people
remember you around here.

45:29.814 --> 45:31.879
You might be able
to get on the news.

45:31.903 --> 45:33.707
- That won't work.

45:33.731 --> 45:34.731
- Why?

45:36.995 --> 45:38.886
- I had a top 20 pop hit.

45:38.910 --> 45:41.279
And I thought I was a big deal.

45:41.303 --> 45:43.436
Gave a bunch of interviews
about this place

45:44.306 --> 45:45.307
and slagged on it.

45:47.657 --> 45:49.592
These were good people.

45:49.616 --> 45:53.751
And they believed in
me and I flushed 'em.

45:57.189 --> 45:58.756
- So then what happened?

45:59.931 --> 46:02.779
- Well, right when we
were hitting the charts,

46:02.803 --> 46:04.196
this scandal came out.

46:07.939 --> 46:09.786
When I was recording the album,

46:09.810 --> 46:13.616
the record company told me
that I had the right look

46:13.640 --> 46:18.645
but, uh, they had somebody
better to cover the tracks.

46:19.646 --> 46:20.646
So...

46:21.474 --> 46:23.650
- So you didn't sing at all?

46:25.217 --> 46:26.217
- Nope.

46:28.829 --> 46:29.829
I wanted to.

46:34.530 --> 46:35.531
I wanted to.

46:38.578 --> 46:39.797
- After that...

46:41.320 --> 46:43.670
- Dropped off the
charts like a hot rock.

46:45.454 --> 46:47.108
Had a complete
nervous breakdown.

46:48.849 --> 46:50.174
I bottomed out.

46:50.198 --> 46:51.373
I'm lucky to be alive.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.421
And that's when I
met Brody's dad.

46:57.989 --> 46:59.642
He put me back together again.

47:02.297 --> 47:03.297
Saved me.

47:08.913 --> 47:10.542
Anyway, I got a call from my dad

47:10.566 --> 47:13.395
that he's got liver
cancer so here I am.

47:15.789 --> 47:18.115
- What did they say
his outlook was?

47:18.139 --> 47:21.162
- A 15% survival
rate past five years

47:21.186 --> 47:24.015
but with this surgery he's
got a fighting chance.

47:27.018 --> 47:30.127
- I think it took a lot
of guts coming back here.

47:30.151 --> 47:32.371
Taking care of your
dad like this.

47:33.372 --> 47:34.958
I do.

47:34.982 --> 47:35.982
- Really?

47:37.593 --> 47:39.920
I mean, it's not like I left
behind some fabulous life.

47:39.944 --> 47:40.944
- Doesn't matter.

47:42.250 --> 47:43.730
You always have options, Kim.

47:45.819 --> 47:47.299
Don't forget that.

47:59.311 --> 48:01.463
- What are my options now?

48:01.487 --> 48:02.768
- Um...

48:02.792 --> 48:03.792
I...

48:04.751 --> 48:06.057
I give a really good back rub.

48:08.059 --> 48:09.799
I give a really
good foot rub too.

48:10.800 --> 48:11.800
- Really?

49:25.049 --> 49:26.180
- Thanks, Mom.

49:31.403 --> 49:32.403
- Mom!

49:37.452 --> 49:38.473
- Dad!

49:38.497 --> 49:40.040
- Get him out of here!

49:40.064 --> 49:41.464
- What the hell are
you shooting at?

49:43.241 --> 49:44.087
- Mom.

49:44.111 --> 49:45.045
- Wait.

49:45.069 --> 49:45.828
Dad, put the gun down.

49:45.852 --> 49:46.852
Where's Kinky?

49:47.767 --> 49:49.049
Brody!

49:49.073 --> 49:50.180
Brody!

49:50.204 --> 49:52.269
- Brody, don't you touch that.

49:52.293 --> 49:53.140
- Brody!

49:53.164 --> 49:54.271
- Brody!

49:54.295 --> 49:57.144
You get the hell back here.

50:15.186 --> 50:17.729
How about these dinners?

50:17.753 --> 50:19.886
Package even said
"deformity free".

50:25.370 --> 50:26.370
Nothing?

50:28.808 --> 50:32.309
- Brody could have
gotten really hurt, Dad.

50:32.333 --> 50:34.181
Why would you do
something like that?

50:34.205 --> 50:36.139
- You didn't see
them being born.

50:36.163 --> 50:38.663
The way they were hurting Kinky.

50:38.687 --> 50:40.187
The way they might hurt us.

50:40.211 --> 50:41.211
- Hurt us?

50:42.300 --> 50:44.104
- I don't know.

50:44.128 --> 50:46.410
I was putting them out of their
misery, for crying out loud.

50:46.434 --> 50:48.456
You think I like
killing puppies?

50:48.480 --> 50:49.480
- Yes.

51:02.015 --> 51:03.123
- You know, this
the first mammal

51:03.147 --> 51:04.322
we've seen like this.

51:07.499 --> 51:08.630
- What's wrong with it?

51:09.718 --> 51:10.937
- I'm trying to find out.

51:12.199 --> 51:13.568
Of course it would have helped

51:13.592 --> 51:16.334
if the rest of them
weren't in pieces.

51:18.118 --> 51:20.444
- Is it even safe for
us to stay here?

51:20.468 --> 51:22.446
- We have no idea
whether it's related

51:22.470 --> 51:24.927
to any kind of
chemical pollutant.

51:24.951 --> 51:26.581
- Well, what the hell
you think it is then?

51:26.605 --> 51:27.605
X-Men?

51:29.129 --> 51:31.523
Ah, didn't think I knew
about them, did ya?

51:39.835 --> 51:40.835
- Brody, don't touch it.

51:44.188 --> 51:45.556
- Truth is to this day
we don't even know

51:45.580 --> 51:47.278
what causes most
human birth defects.

51:48.540 --> 51:49.647
You mentioned something
the other day

51:49.671 --> 51:51.301
about finding a bunch of snails.

51:51.325 --> 51:52.215
- Yeah, a ton.

51:52.239 --> 51:53.651
- There's been cases

51:53.675 --> 51:56.219
where parasitic worm
life cycles launch

51:56.243 --> 51:58.265
using a snail as a host.

51:58.289 --> 52:00.397
See, the snail carries
'em down to the water

52:00.421 --> 52:02.965
where they run loose and
invade another species,

52:02.989 --> 52:03.990
like a tadpole.

52:05.774 --> 52:08.144
See, they burrow into the
tadpole right at the limb buds,

52:08.168 --> 52:10.364
deliberately screwing
up the development,

52:10.388 --> 52:12.670
causing missing or extra limbs.

52:12.694 --> 52:14.716
- Why would a parasite do that?

52:14.740 --> 52:16.892
- When the tadpole
matures into a frog,

52:16.916 --> 52:19.875
it's handicapped so it's
easy prey for birds.

52:21.181 --> 52:23.028
The bird easily swoops
down, picks up the frog,

52:23.052 --> 52:24.184
eats it, digests it.

52:25.968 --> 52:28.599
The parasite can then spawn
more larvae in the bird feces

52:28.623 --> 52:30.993
and the infected feces then
fall down to the shore

52:31.017 --> 52:32.603
and gets picked up by the snail.

52:32.627 --> 52:34.063
The whole cycle starts again.

52:35.195 --> 52:37.739
- Sounds like damned
science fiction.

52:37.763 --> 52:40.418
- What if these parasites
are getting into our water?

52:43.725 --> 52:45.486
- Hello.

52:45.510 --> 52:47.488
Today we're talking with local
pop sensation Kim Sweet,

52:47.512 --> 52:49.838
visiting us in our
public access studio

52:49.862 --> 52:53.015
and, uh, Kim, uh, I believe
you have something you'd like

52:53.039 --> 52:55.974
to say to the people of
Duluth before we get started?

52:55.998 --> 53:00.873
- Yes, um, I just want to
apologize to the people of Duluth

53:02.918 --> 53:07.923
for anything that I said
that was really stupid

53:10.187 --> 53:12.861
when I was young and
for any of the hurt

53:12.885 --> 53:14.558
that I might have caused.

53:14.582 --> 53:17.909
Um, there are really good
people here in this town

53:17.933 --> 53:21.067
and I, um, I'm very, very sorry.

53:22.547 --> 53:23.547
Thank you.

53:25.724 --> 53:29.293
- Thank you, Kim, for, um, your
brave and sincere apology.

53:30.729 --> 53:34.665
But, um, what I'd like to talk
to you about today, um, here

53:34.689 --> 53:37.451
is about the deformed frogs
you found near your home?

53:37.475 --> 53:38.756
- Yes.

53:38.780 --> 53:40.671
There have been
some deformed frogs

53:40.695 --> 53:43.413
that have been turning up
in the lakes and the ponds

53:43.437 --> 53:48.442
in the area and we don't
know what is causing it, um,

53:49.617 --> 53:50.812
but we think it
could be a problem

53:50.836 --> 53:52.683
and maybe a very
serious problem.

53:52.707 --> 53:55.730
- Well, you know, considering
you're not a scientist

53:55.754 --> 54:00.149
of any kind, some might accuse
you of being an alarmist.

54:01.412 --> 54:02.258
- Okay.

54:02.282 --> 54:03.282
Alright.

54:04.806 --> 54:08.438
Okay, so my, our family dog
had puppies this weekend

54:08.462 --> 54:10.179
and, um, sorry.

54:10.203 --> 54:11.509
- Oh, god, okay.

54:16.731 --> 54:17.993
- This is, this is one.

54:19.995 --> 54:21.973
Does that look alarmist to you?

54:21.997 --> 54:23.366
I just...

54:23.390 --> 54:24.411
- I don't want that...

54:24.435 --> 54:26.108
Oh, my god, we are so done.

54:26.132 --> 54:27.932
- I just, if Mayor Paulson
is watching this...

55:01.428 --> 55:03.928
- What about deviled
ham for breakfast?

55:03.952 --> 55:04.799
- Breakfast?

55:04.823 --> 55:05.582
- Sounds delicious.

55:05.606 --> 55:07.018
- Grody, Brody.

55:07.042 --> 55:08.696
Alright, pick out a
cereal, you get one.

55:09.567 --> 55:11.153
Hey, hey, hey.

55:11.177 --> 55:13.198
You want some sugar to
go with your sugar?

55:13.222 --> 55:14.222
Come on, healthy.

55:15.616 --> 55:16.811
Chocolate sauce?

55:16.835 --> 55:17.879
That's too expensive.

55:19.707 --> 55:21.032
- Well, what about this?

55:21.056 --> 55:22.338
It's kid-tested and
mother approved.

55:22.362 --> 55:23.905
- Sold.

55:23.929 --> 55:24.775
Alright, we gotta make tracks.

55:24.799 --> 55:26.342
- Sounds healthy.

55:26.366 --> 55:27.822
- What you got there, Munchkin?

55:27.846 --> 55:29.867
You want me to go find
you a couple masks?

55:36.898 --> 55:39.486
- Dude, get us some bananas.

55:39.510 --> 55:42.184
- Oh, look, he's
pretending he can read.

55:42.208 --> 55:44.665
- Oh, hey, Joe, looks
like they got a picture

55:44.689 --> 55:47.363
of your long lost
relative in the paper.

55:47.387 --> 55:48.387
Huh?

55:50.825 --> 55:52.325
- Hey, if he hasn't done
anything to the water,

55:52.349 --> 55:54.196
how about a blood test?

55:54.220 --> 55:55.632
See if you're contagious.

55:55.656 --> 55:57.068
You know, just to prove
everybody wrong?

55:57.092 --> 55:59.419
- You mean prove you
wrong, asshole.

55:59.443 --> 56:00.985
- Easy, kitten.

56:01.009 --> 56:03.031
- Yeah, we know what
kind of freak you are.

56:03.055 --> 56:03.858
Calm down.

56:03.882 --> 56:04.882
- I got an idea.

56:06.058 --> 56:06.991
Why don't we test your kid?

56:07.015 --> 56:08.297
- Hey!

56:22.335 --> 56:23.965
Hey, uh, Joseph.

56:23.989 --> 56:28.994
Um, uh, you guys doing okay?

56:33.564 --> 56:34.782
What are you looking at?

56:37.959 --> 56:39.134
People can be shits.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.138
- Please, don't hurt me!

56:45.271 --> 56:48.598
- Hey, just take a
breath, grandma.

56:48.622 --> 56:50.668
Hey, hey, hey!

56:52.626 --> 56:53.714
They're not worth it.

57:01.287 --> 57:02.593
Hey, it's, uh...

57:03.985 --> 57:04.985
I get it.

57:09.338 --> 57:11.795
You know, um, we're neighbors.

57:11.819 --> 57:14.126
We live right across the lake.

57:15.257 --> 57:16.911
So if you guys ever
need anything.

57:20.872 --> 57:23.570
You know, just don't
be a stranger.

57:42.807 --> 57:43.807
Yeah?

57:54.471 --> 57:55.622
- Push.
- Come on, push.

57:55.646 --> 57:56.623
- Keep pushing, good.

57:56.647 --> 57:57.667
- Yeah.

57:57.691 --> 57:59.190
- Good, good, keep pushing.

57:59.214 --> 57:59.974
- Push, dammit, like
you're on a leg press.

57:59.998 --> 58:00.844
Come on, push.

58:00.868 --> 58:01.976
- Push, push, push.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.064
- Look, babe, you're doin' good.

58:03.088 --> 58:04.021
- Good, okay,
alright, good, good.

58:04.045 --> 58:05.066
- You gotta push.

58:05.090 --> 58:06.459
You're doing good, come on.

58:06.483 --> 58:07.198
- Good, good, good, good, good.

58:07.222 --> 58:08.025
- Push.

58:08.049 --> 58:09.592
Okay, okay, come on, focus.

58:09.616 --> 58:11.420
That was good. - That was good.

58:11.444 --> 58:12.247
- You're doing good.
- Alright, breathe.

58:12.271 --> 58:13.271
Alright, focus!

58:14.534 --> 58:16.425
- Good, good, good, push.
Come on.

58:16.449 --> 58:17.861
You're doing great, come on.

58:17.885 --> 58:19.384
- That was good, that was good.

58:19.408 --> 58:20.734
Breathing.

58:20.758 --> 58:22.083
Alright, here we go,
here's one more.

58:22.107 --> 58:22.779
- You're gonna go another set.

58:22.803 --> 58:23.650
- I can't.

58:23.674 --> 58:25.042
- Is this normal?

58:25.066 --> 58:26.391
She looks like she's
in a lot of pain.

58:26.415 --> 58:27.828
Breathe. Now we're gonna
do another set, come on.

58:27.852 --> 58:29.699
- Here we go, one
more, one more.

58:29.723 --> 58:31.092
- Just like we're at the
gym, come on, push, come on.

58:31.116 --> 58:32.049
- You gotta push.

58:32.073 --> 58:33.181
- Here it comes.

58:33.205 --> 58:35.270
- Oh my God!

58:35.294 --> 58:36.401
- No, this isn't normal.

58:36.425 --> 58:38.186
Something's not right.

58:38.210 --> 58:39.840
- Good, good, good.

58:39.864 --> 58:41.189
The baby's coming, here we go.

58:41.213 --> 58:42.930
Here we go, here we go!

58:42.954 --> 58:44.758
- You're doing good,
you're doing good.

58:44.782 --> 58:46.411
Get her some pain
pills, come on.

58:47.698 --> 58:49.066
Push!

58:49.090 --> 58:50.720
- Good, good, good.

58:52.137 --> 58:54.942
- You did it, you did it.

59:22.907 --> 59:23.907
Oh!

59:29.130 --> 59:30.130
Fuck that!

59:51.239 --> 59:52.652
- Look, I understand
your concern

59:52.676 --> 59:54.175
but you really don't
need to stay here.

59:54.199 --> 59:56.220
I mean, he'll probably
be out for quite awhile.

59:56.244 --> 59:57.942
I promise, we'll
keep you updated.

59:59.421 --> 01:00:00.421
- Can you just...

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.010
Can you at least tell me

01:00:03.034 --> 01:00:04.098
what you think might
have caused the tumor?

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:05.752
- We actually don't know yet.

01:00:05.776 --> 01:00:07.884
He never had regular checkups
over the years so...

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.625
Has he had a history
of alcoholism?

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.649
- No.

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:15.524
I mean, not that I know of.

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:18.939
- Well, if not I would
think Hepatitis B or C

01:00:18.963 --> 01:00:21.942
but he doesn't have
either of those.

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:24.422
Parasites, arsenic...

01:00:24.446 --> 01:00:25.641
- Parasites?

01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:27.512
- From contaminated water.

01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.950
Oh, but that's usually only
found in developing countries

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:31.149
so I'm sure...

01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:33.933
Anyway.

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:48.687
- Judy.

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:50.492
Hey.

01:00:50.516 --> 01:00:52.537
- Oh, hi, Kim.

01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:54.017
What are you doing here?

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:56.237
- Yeah, I was just, uh,
checking on my dad.

01:00:56.261 --> 01:00:57.064
- Oh, I heard.

01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.587
I'm so sorry.

01:00:58.611 --> 01:01:00.067
I hope he'll be okay.

01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:01.024
- Well, we all missed
seeing you at Mike's.

01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:03.505
I figured the baby came.

01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:04.529
Can I say hello?

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.074
- She's really sick.

01:01:07.098 --> 01:01:08.249
- Oh, I just, I
gotta take a peek.

01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:09.970
- She's really sick.

01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:13.712
Look, I'm...

01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:16.324
I have to go.

01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:19.457
- What's she got?

01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:27.901
- Some might accuse you
of being an alarmist.

01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:30.991
- Okay, alright, uh...

01:01:32.384 --> 01:01:36.190
Okay, so my, our family dog
had puppies this weekend

01:01:36.214 --> 01:01:38.366
and, um, sorry.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.202
What?

01:01:48.226 --> 01:01:50.204
Does that look alarmist to you?

01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:51.553
I just...

01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:53.120
- I don't want that.

01:01:53.144 --> 01:01:54.624
Oh my God, we are so done.
- I just...

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:11.442
- Kim?

01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:12.966
- Hey.

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.296
- Look, Kim, I'm
really busy right now.

01:02:16.297 --> 01:02:19.257
- Judy, look.

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:21.912
I know something's wrong.

01:02:29.484 --> 01:02:31.443
What did you name her?

01:02:32.618 --> 01:02:33.618
- Danielle.

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:36.622
- That's real pretty.

01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:42.759
- Look, I don't want anyone
else in the town to know.

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:48.765
And please, please don't let
Sam know that you know.

01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:53.789
- Yeah.

01:02:53.813 --> 01:02:54.813
Of course.

01:03:13.398 --> 01:03:14.398
Judy.

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:18.837
That's...

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:25.018
Listen, do you mind if I...

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:28.456
Could I take a few photos?

01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:32.697
- Why do you want to take
pictures of my baby?

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:35.657
- Look, I know... I know this
has got to be so hard for you.

01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:36.681
I can't even...

01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:39.748
I can't even imagine.

01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:41.532
But if I could just
take a few pictures,

01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:46.170
just collect some evidence,
then maybe we could get help.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:47.823
- Help for what?

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:54.284
- Don't you want to
know what caused this?

01:03:54.308 --> 01:03:56.112
- These things happen.

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.461
And it's nature.

01:03:57.485 --> 01:03:58.925
It's not like I'm
the first one ever.

01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:05.861
- What about the
animal deformities?

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:06.906
What about those...

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.255
- What are you saying now,

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:09.299
that my baby is some
kind of animal?

01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:10.910
Is that what you're saying?

01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:11.867
- No.

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:12.955
No, Judy.

01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:13.979
I, um...

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:17.984
Look, here.

01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:21.727
Please just take a look at this.

01:04:37.482 --> 01:04:38.570
I'm so sorry.

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:22.416
Here's your proof.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.026
Take it and use it.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.201
We need to keep pesticides
out of the wetlands.

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:26.768
- Are you following me?

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:28.726
- At least call the Governor

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.598
and stop telling everybody
that things are fine

01:05:30.622 --> 01:05:31.425
when you know that...

01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:33.253
- Miss Sweet.

01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:35.472
I know that you've had some
puppies born with complications

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:38.195
but different is not
necessarily bad.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:40.458
Okay, that's bad.

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:44.612
Uh, where did this happen?

01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:47.093
- Where do you
think it happened?

01:05:47.117 --> 01:05:48.224
God, what smells?

01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:49.660
I think that salmon is bad.

01:05:49.684 --> 01:05:51.097
- No, the salmon is
actually very good.

01:05:51.121 --> 01:05:53.882
You know, you can have
some if you want.

01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:55.797
So who did this happen to?

01:05:55.821 --> 01:05:58.408
- She doesn't want to be
identified in the media.

01:05:58.432 --> 01:05:59.235
- Right.

01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:00.584
Okay.

01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:01.324
So why is this
happening so quickly?

01:06:01.348 --> 01:06:02.348
- Parasites.

01:06:03.307 --> 01:06:04.458
- Not pesticides?

01:06:04.482 --> 01:06:05.482
- No.

01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:09.202
Pesticides and fertilizer
dramatically increase algae

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:11.769
and plant material
that snails feed on.

01:06:11.793 --> 01:06:13.293
- So snails are the bad guys?

01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:15.623
- Snails are the hosts
for the parasite babies.

01:06:16.885 --> 01:06:18.428
- Parasite babies?

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:22.911
- You know, little parasite
baby maggot things?

01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:23.999
- Oh, the larvae?

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:25.392
- Exactly.

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:27.829
Look, you wanted
evidence, here it is.

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:31.137
More pesticides, more
snails, more parasites.

01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:32.834
- Got a problem

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:34.967
and that is we've had
pesticides around for decades.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.012
Why is this happening now?

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.361
- Well, you said yourself

01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:40.189
that this spring
was the first time

01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:42.278
that American Patriots Chemicals
have been used in the area?

01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:45.629
Okay, well maybe there's something
in their eco-friendly mix

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:47.525
that gives the algae a boost.

01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:53.357
Look, and there's also deformed
frog sightings upstate.

01:06:54.358 --> 01:06:55.576
This year and last year.

01:06:58.536 --> 01:07:00.340
- Are these the places

01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:02.037
where you found the deformities?

01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:03.061
- Yeah.

01:07:04.629 --> 01:07:06.892
- These are the same locations
as the disappearances.

01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:12.767
But if we're looking for a
kidnapper, serial killer,

01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:17.618
then why would that correspond
to the deformities?

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:18.706
- You think they're connected?

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:19.750
God, how can you stand that?

01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:20.751
That smell is awful.

01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:22.144
- What, this?

01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:25.191
No, this is yummy.

01:07:25.215 --> 01:07:26.540
- Ugh.

01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:28.107
- I think you just
don't like fish.

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.151
- No, I normally love salmon.

01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:30.892
That shit is rank.

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:31.980
- I promise you it's not.

01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:33.484
- Ugh, excuse me.

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:35.573
- Are you alright?

01:08:10.782 --> 01:08:11.889
- Hey!

01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:13.369
What, what's with the pictures?

01:08:13.393 --> 01:08:14.588
- I was just taking a picture

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:16.807
of that pregnant
lady over there.

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:18.964
Might be one of them
monster babies.

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:20.834
- What?

01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:24.772
Get out of here!

01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:26.555
- Months earlier.

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.428
Most recent numbers in the
birth defect outbreak are...

01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:29.627
- Christ, Kim.

01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:33.041
You can't be pulling that kind
of stuff with the tourists.

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:35.130
They spend a lot
of money in here.

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:36.261
- Yeah, but did you
see his shirt?

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:37.305
- Oh, I know, I know.

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:38.505
They're everywhere.

01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:41.334
Hey, I'm sorry about your dad.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:43.269
- Yeah.

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:44.292
Thanks.

01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:47.229
Where's Greg?

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:48.970
- You didn't hear?

01:08:48.993 --> 01:08:50.885
- No, I've been off a few days.
What?

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:54.453
- His sister gave birth to
one of those mutant babies.

01:08:54.478 --> 01:08:55.890
- Oh, no.

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:56.934
Is she okay?

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:58.805
- She's in shock.

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:02.243
I mean, I think they're gonna
give it up to the researchers.

01:09:02.268 --> 01:09:03.288
- What?

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:04.353
- Well, what would you do?

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:06.857
- I don't know but I don't
know if I'd pawn it off

01:09:06.881 --> 01:09:07.944
like some lab rat.

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:09.469
- Well, it's not going away.

01:09:09.493 --> 01:09:11.862
I mean, everybody's leaving.

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:14.691
And the whole town
might get quarantined.

01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:17.433
And the crazy thing is

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:21.069
all these tourists
keep coming in here.

01:09:23.028 --> 01:09:25.683
- Yeah, checking out more
than the fall leaves, huh?

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:27.510
- Yeah.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.231
- I personally investigated

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.344
since the first deformed
frog was found.

01:09:35.736 --> 01:09:38.453
The Governor has been made
fully aware of our situation.

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:40.456
The Environmental
Protection Agency,

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.179
the Center for Disease Control
have also been notified.

01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:47.792
The citizens of Duluth
will be taken care of.

01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:53.774
- The birth defect
outbreak are...

01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:20.453
- What's your problem?

01:10:20.477 --> 01:10:22.043
- She-freak must
be his girlfriend.

01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:27.242
That's what my dad said
should be done to you

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:29.113
and your creepy dad.

01:10:29.137 --> 01:10:30.724
- Why?

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:33.161
- Because of you, my aunt's
baby's all messed up.

01:11:13.181 --> 01:11:15.072
- Trent Douglas.

01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:16.096
- Yes?

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:22.146
- We need to talk.

01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:30.981
- What is it, girl?

01:11:45.997 --> 01:11:46.997
What is it?

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:48.781
Shh, shh.

01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:51.108
It's okay.

01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:52.153
Shh, sweetie.

01:11:52.177 --> 01:11:53.177
Shh, shh.

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:58.420
Stop, shh, it's alright,
it's okay, it's alright.

01:11:58.444 --> 01:12:00.335
It's alright, girl, it's okay.

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:01.359
Please.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:05.819
Stop.

01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:07.124
Stop.

01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:08.324
Shh, shh, shh.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.160
Ugh, ugh.

01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:23.489
Well, could you just come out
here and look at her, please?

01:12:23.513 --> 01:12:24.490
Please.

01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:26.080
It's awful.

01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:30.388
Trent?

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:34.392
Trent?

01:12:44.142 --> 01:12:45.317
What the fuck?

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.367
Okay.

01:12:55.283 --> 01:12:56.086
- Yeah.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.913
- How's that?

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.374
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:01.811
- That better?

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:08.513
- Thanks.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.430
How's my dog?

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:15.913
- She's, she's fine.

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:18.088
Yeah.

01:13:21.788 --> 01:13:25.401
- I want you to take her
and Brody and leave town.

01:13:28.969 --> 01:13:30.275
- Why would we leave?

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:43.419
- Honey, the cancer
is inoperable.

01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:46.029
It always was.

01:13:48.032 --> 01:13:49.947
The tumor's growing real fast.

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:53.951
You never have as much time
as you think you will.

01:13:56.606 --> 01:13:58.216
- God damn it, Pops.

01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:01.785
Why didn't you fucking tell me?

01:14:03.613 --> 01:14:05.591
- Wanted to give you hope.

01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:09.769
I figured if the surgery was
always a little ways off,

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:12.230
maybe you'd stick around longer.

01:14:15.973 --> 01:14:17.365
I'm sorry I hurt you.

01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:27.897
Come here.

01:14:31.249 --> 01:14:32.487
Hold my hand.

01:14:41.955 --> 01:14:43.716
Oh, you know as well as anyone

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.154
that none of us knows what
the hell we're doing.

01:14:47.178 --> 01:14:51.356
We just do what we think
best at the time.

01:14:54.185 --> 01:14:55.185
- Yeah.

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:02.018
I do.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:08.024
We're...

01:15:11.681 --> 01:15:13.378
And we're not going anywhere.

01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:07.060
- Hello, Sam.

01:16:07.084 --> 01:16:08.084
- Hey, Sam.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.892
Look, Sam, I've been thinking
about this on the way over.

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:14.241
- No, shut up.

01:16:14.265 --> 01:16:15.068
We had an agreement.

01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:16.896
Okay?

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.280
You guys do mine and if they
need it, I'll do your sister's.

01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:21.161
It's gonna be easier this way.

01:16:21.185 --> 01:16:22.510
Trust me.

01:16:22.534 --> 01:16:24.077
- Look, man, this
is really crazy.

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:25.513
We can't...

01:16:25.537 --> 01:16:27.123
- Look. Look at what
it's doing to her.

01:16:27.147 --> 01:16:28.516
Okay?

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:29.933
That thing is not human.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.216
- God.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.305
I mean, aside from getting
caught, we can't...

01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:36.698
- We're not gonna get caught

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:38.202
because we're all in
agreement, right?

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:41.094
Right?

01:16:41.118 --> 01:16:42.617
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:44.053
- Yeah.

01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:47.298
- Okay, now, let's just
stick to the plan.

01:16:50.214 --> 01:16:52.129
Come on, stick to the plan.
Get in there.

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:54.391
Come on.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:57.937
- Hey, Judy.

01:16:57.961 --> 01:16:58.961
- Hi.

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:04.837
- So, uh, how do you
want to do this, Sam?

01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:07.492
- What are you, what
are you gonna do?

01:17:14.107 --> 01:17:16.477
- It's doing something to you.

01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:18.479
I mean, hell, for all I know,

01:17:18.503 --> 01:17:21.525
it could be spreading
something to me.

01:17:21.549 --> 01:17:22.549
Come on.

01:17:23.813 --> 01:17:24.790
Give it here.

01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:25.747
We'll take it.

01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:26.816
- Her name is Danielle.

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:29.055
It's Danielle.

01:17:36.521 --> 01:17:37.629
No, don't, don't.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:38.653
No!

01:17:39.611 --> 01:17:40.719
- Give me, give me that thing!

01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:41.743
- No, no!

01:17:47.184 --> 01:17:50.119
- Take it to the bathroom!

01:17:55.322 --> 01:17:57.673
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:03.416
- Go!

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640
- No, no!

01:19:24.934 --> 01:19:26.631
- Sorry about Chuck.

01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:33.943
- You hung up on me.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.923
Why did you do that?

01:19:37.947 --> 01:19:39.054
- I...

01:19:39.078 --> 01:19:40.795
- Why didn't you call me back?

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.212
- I was gonna call you back.

01:19:43.953 --> 01:19:45.495
I just...

01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:46.782
I'm sorry, I was...

01:19:50.089 --> 01:19:51.787
I was just dealing
with something.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:01.230
- Just don't.

01:20:07.715 --> 01:20:10.303
- Do you want to tell me
what happened to Kinky?

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:11.981
- I don't even fucking know.

01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:16.352
She started shaking.

01:20:16.376 --> 01:20:17.440
She couldn't stop.

01:20:17.464 --> 01:20:19.181
I tried to hold her still

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:22.252
and her skin was so thin it
tore underneath my fingers.

01:20:23.993 --> 01:20:25.753
She shook and shook and shook

01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:27.977
and then vomited all over
herself and then she was dead.

01:20:30.521 --> 01:20:32.891
- The fetus leaves behind
a parasite infestation

01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.849
carried over from the water.

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:37.460
Theoretically this could
affect an entire generation

01:20:37.484 --> 01:20:39.158
of a species.

01:20:39.182 --> 01:20:40.333
- We can take our research
and go to the government

01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:42.596
and we can get help, right?

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.709
- That's what I want
to talk to you about.

01:20:48.017 --> 01:20:49.017
- What?

01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:04.139
That's a lot of money.

01:21:04.163 --> 01:21:05.184
- American Patriot will launch

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.383
its own investigation.

01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:11.127
I can have my mother
taken care of.

01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:14.086
We can move away from all this.

01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:24.357
- What if this shit's
getting in Lake Superior?

01:21:26.185 --> 01:21:27.708
When does it stop?

01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:36.934
No.

01:21:38.632 --> 01:21:39.632
Hell, no.

01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:01.544
- A verb is a word
that displays...

01:22:01.568 --> 01:22:02.676
- Action.

01:22:04.093 --> 01:22:05.287
- Freaks!

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:09.010
- Stop!

01:22:16.757 --> 01:22:18.324
- Get him, get him!

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:28.943
- Shit.

01:22:39.650 --> 01:22:42.107
- Where are you, you
ugly little brat?

01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:44.960
- My sister had one
of those things.

01:22:46.135 --> 01:22:48.006
You did something to
the water, didn't you?

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.096
- You know we didn't, Greg.

01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:55.318
Please don't hurt my girl.

01:22:58.712 --> 01:23:00.627
- What did you put in
the water, Joseph?

01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:06.546
Did you put something
in the water?

01:23:07.678 --> 01:23:08.984
- You know we didn't.

01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:16.861
- We want you out
of town tonight.

01:23:22.519 --> 01:23:23.607
- We're gone.

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:27.152
- Just don't talk to anyone.

01:23:27.176 --> 01:23:28.849
I'm coming right back, alright?

01:23:28.873 --> 01:23:31.025
I want to clean out my desk
before they confiscate it

01:23:31.049 --> 01:23:33.008
because they may
quarantine the town soon.

01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:36.726
- I'll be waiting.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:37.838
- I'll be right back.

01:23:39.884 --> 01:23:40.884
- Hey.

01:23:47.065 --> 01:23:49.261
I'll tell you when you get back.

01:23:49.285 --> 01:23:50.285
- Alright.

01:23:54.942 --> 01:23:55.942
- What is it?

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:04.102
- Get inside!
- Trent!

01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:21.554
- Oh, I'm bit.

01:24:21.578 --> 01:24:22.990
I'm bit, I'm bit!

01:24:23.014 --> 01:24:24.600
Crazy little freak!

01:24:24.624 --> 01:24:26.428
- They're not vampires,
you dumb shit.

01:24:26.452 --> 01:24:28.300
- What do I do with her?

01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:46.970
- I say we finish
this right now.

01:24:46.994 --> 01:24:48.929
- He agreed to leave.

01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:51.018
- And they just get
to leave it behind?

01:24:51.042 --> 01:24:52.802
- We're not killing anybody.

01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:53.934
- We're not killing.

01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:55.109
We're saving.

01:24:55.133 --> 01:24:56.308
We're saving our town.

01:24:57.266 --> 01:24:58.634
What about Judy?

01:24:58.658 --> 01:24:59.658
Huh?

01:25:01.008 --> 01:25:02.160
- What proof do you have
that we're the cause?

01:25:02.184 --> 01:25:05.076
- Just shoot the ugly bastard!

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.687
We're not sparing the
ones that did this.

01:25:07.711 --> 01:25:10.342
- What do you mean the ones?
You are not touching the girl.

01:25:10.366 --> 01:25:11.821
- This lake is ground zero.

01:25:11.845 --> 01:25:14.259
Do you see any other
mutants around here?

01:25:14.283 --> 01:25:15.869
- Help, help.

01:25:15.893 --> 01:25:16.826
I need help.

01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:17.914
424 McGregor Lake Road.

01:25:17.938 --> 01:25:19.264
Please, please can you send...

01:25:19.288 --> 01:25:20.830
Send officers, please!

01:25:20.854 --> 01:25:21.962
Please send help now!

01:25:21.986 --> 01:25:23.050
There's been an animal attack.

01:25:23.074 --> 01:25:24.269
Trent!

01:25:24.293 --> 01:25:25.618
Trent!

01:25:25.642 --> 01:25:27.620
A friend of ours,
he was attacked.

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:29.274
Brody!

01:25:29.298 --> 01:25:30.536
Brody!

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.560
Oh, my God.

01:25:32.431 --> 01:25:34.041
Just fucking send help!

01:25:36.305 --> 01:25:38.065
- Take it easy.

01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:39.675
- Nobody wanted them here.

01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:40.720
What about Judy, huh?

01:25:40.744 --> 01:25:41.590
- He's gonna leave.

01:25:41.614 --> 01:25:42.765
Just take it easy.

01:25:42.789 --> 01:25:43.853
- I don't trust him.

01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:45.159
I don't trust these mutants.

01:25:45.183 --> 01:25:46.682
They're not people.

01:25:46.706 --> 01:25:48.467
Why couldn't you just leave?

01:25:48.491 --> 01:25:49.927
Nobody wants you here!

01:25:50.797 --> 01:25:51.948
This ends right now.

01:25:51.972 --> 01:25:53.167
- No, Sam.

01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:54.647
No, no!

01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:55.691
Sammy, no!

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:56.715
No deaths, dammit.

01:26:05.682 --> 01:26:07.268
- Drop the weapon!

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:10.402
Drop the weapon now. - Alright.

01:26:10.426 --> 01:26:11.838
- Ma'am?

01:26:11.862 --> 01:26:13.013
Did you make that 911 call?

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:14.493
- Yes, yes.

01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:16.157
I need you to help me
find my son, please.

01:26:16.519 --> 01:26:18.018
I don't know where he is.

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:21.524
But there's some kind of
wild animal out here.

01:26:30.924 --> 01:26:32.380
- I'm gonna kill
you, you fat freak.

01:26:32.404 --> 01:26:33.404
I swear I'll kill him.

01:26:42.066 --> 01:26:43.067
- You hear that?

01:26:44.024 --> 01:26:45.024
- Sounds close.

01:26:46.026 --> 01:26:47.593
- Call for back up.

01:26:49.552 --> 01:26:50.596
- Behind you!

01:27:10.964 --> 01:27:12.551
- Michelle?

01:27:12.575 --> 01:27:13.856
Michelle?

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:14.988
Michelle?

01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:16.381
Michelle?

01:27:16.405 --> 01:27:17.556
Michelle.

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:18.557
Michelle.

01:27:18.581 --> 01:27:20.080
Michelle.

01:27:58.142 --> 01:28:00.275
- Station 13-75, Code
Two, officer down.

01:28:02.973 --> 01:28:04.429
- Brody.

01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:14.767
- I love you.

01:28:31.828 --> 01:28:32.828
Go home.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.720
- Brody.

01:29:40.853 --> 01:29:41.853
Shh.

01:29:47.425 --> 01:29:48.425
Outhouse.

01:30:07.445 --> 01:30:08.445
- Oh, God.

01:30:17.194 --> 01:30:18.389
Mom!

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:19.414
- Oh my God.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.750
Brody!

01:30:31.774 --> 01:30:32.949
Get in the house.

01:30:33.906 --> 01:30:35.101
Get in the house!

01:30:47.616 --> 01:30:48.616
Brody, ammo!

01:30:57.887 --> 01:30:58.887
- Daddy!

01:31:25.001 --> 01:31:26.001
Daddy!

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:49.871
- All cases have occurred

01:31:49.895 --> 01:31:52.178
within a 200 mile
radius of Duluth.

01:31:52.202 --> 01:31:54.659
Given research supplied
by Mayor Paulson,

01:31:54.683 --> 01:31:58.924
the CDC and EPA will be
launching full investigations.

01:31:58.948 --> 01:32:00.621
The link between newborns

01:32:00.645 --> 01:32:03.798
and their mother's fatalities
is still undetermined.

01:32:03.822 --> 01:32:05.563
Now back to the ongoing war...

01:32:09.393 --> 01:32:10.393
- Mom?

01:32:13.049 --> 01:32:15.312
Am I a bad person for
what I did to that man?

01:32:16.835 --> 01:32:17.835
- A bad person?

01:32:21.405 --> 01:32:22.580
- I hurt him pretty bad.

01:32:27.454 --> 01:32:28.760
- Did you like hurting him?

01:32:30.022 --> 01:32:31.022
- No.

01:32:32.372 --> 01:32:33.678
- Then I think you're good.

01:32:38.422 --> 01:32:40.705
You know, Brody, I was thinking.

01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:45.037
Maybe next time just brown...

01:32:47.431 --> 01:32:49.627
- Finally, something
I can relate to.

01:32:49.651 --> 01:32:50.651
- Yeah.

01:32:52.305 --> 01:32:54.960
- Do you think babies will
turn out mean like the wolves?

01:32:58.573 --> 01:32:59.748
- I don't know.

01:33:02.185 --> 01:33:04.903
Hey, you ever figure out
what you want to be

01:33:04.927 --> 01:33:05.927
when you grow up?

01:33:07.364 --> 01:33:10.952
- Well, I did want to be
a veterinarian but...

01:33:10.976 --> 01:33:13.694
- Not so much.

01:33:13.718 --> 01:33:14.893
- No.

01:33:17.287 --> 01:33:18.287
- Yeah.

01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:24.773
At least we're getting out of
here before the winter, huh?

01:33:26.557 --> 01:33:27.665
- Mom?

01:33:27.689 --> 01:33:28.689
- Yeah?

01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:30.952
- I'm tired.

01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:34.454
- I bet you are.

01:33:34.478 --> 01:33:35.478
Come here.

01:33:39.526 --> 01:33:40.526
I love you.

01:33:42.051 --> 01:33:43.487
- I love you too.

01:33:57.719 --> 01:33:59.653
- Extreme birth
defects have spread

01:33:59.677 --> 01:34:01.742
to areas surrounding
the Great Lakes.

01:34:01.766 --> 01:34:04.484
Two cases with similar
deformities have surfaced

01:34:04.508 --> 01:34:06.617
in the Green Bay, Wisconsin area

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:09.054
as well as one in
Milwaukee and another two

01:34:09.078 --> 01:34:11.186
in the Detroit, Michigan area.

01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:13.624
Many of these areas
had previous reports

01:34:13.648 --> 01:34:15.495
of deformed wildlife.

01:34:15.519 --> 01:34:18.803
It's believed a deadly combination
of organic pesticides,

01:34:18.827 --> 01:34:21.327
fertilizer and
parasites in the water

01:34:21.351 --> 01:34:23.546
may have led directly
to the outbreak

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:25.244
in the wildlife birth defects

01:34:25.268 --> 01:34:27.923
and possibly the human
fetus complications.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.292
- Hey.

01:34:30.316 --> 01:34:31.685
The wait is over.

01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:33.276
Pick up your copy
today of Inoculation.

01:34:37.367 --> 01:34:38.866
The newest release

01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:40.999
by the hot new alternative
actor, Tall Man.

01:34:41.023 --> 01:34:43.416
Now available at
stores everywhere.

01:34:47.464 --> 01:34:48.659
- Hey.

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:49.901
Just in time.

01:34:51.511 --> 01:34:53.576
Want to come meet
your little sister?

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.600
- Yeah.

01:34:56.299 --> 01:34:57.363
She's so cute.

01:34:57.387 --> 01:34:59.539
- She's so perfect.

01:34:59.563 --> 01:35:01.019
- Like her hat.

01:35:01.043 --> 01:35:02.043
- Yeah.

01:35:03.567 --> 01:35:04.699
This is Brody.

01:35:06.439 --> 01:35:10.376
He's gonna take really
good care of you.

01:38:50.794 --> 01:38:53.077
- Are you sure it's
isolated enough?

01:38:53.101 --> 01:38:55.383
I mean, there's a lot of people
that aren't cool with this.

01:38:55.407 --> 01:38:56.819
- It's fine, believe me.

01:38:56.843 --> 01:38:59.083
I don't want to get
my ass kicked either.

01:38:59.107 --> 01:39:00.107
- Okay.

01:39:00.804 --> 01:39:01.781
Let's whip it out.

01:39:01.805 --> 01:39:02.805
- Okay.

01:39:09.291 --> 01:39:11.138
- Okay.

01:39:11.162 --> 01:39:12.357
- I'm still the wizard but I
want to use a sword this time.

01:39:12.381 --> 01:39:13.532
- No, I'm an elf.

01:39:13.556 --> 01:39:14.750
I get to use the sword.

01:39:14.774 --> 01:39:16.230
You can use a wand.

01:39:16.254 --> 01:39:18.039
- I don't want some lame twig.

01:39:19.127 --> 01:39:20.713
- You smell that?

01:39:20.737 --> 01:39:22.410
- Oh, what the hell?
