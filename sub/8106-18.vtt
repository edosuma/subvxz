WEBVTT

00:22.272 --> 00:25.024
Fran? I'm Robin.

00:25.401 --> 00:26.401
Please come in.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.116
Cute home.
Two bedroom, one bath?

00:33.701 --> 00:34.909
Yeah.

00:36.286 --> 00:40.456
A guy I know collects those. Says
they're worth a fortune on the internet.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.666
Yeah.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.795
You've never used
our agency before, have you?

00:45.921 --> 00:47.547
Is it that obvious?

00:56.223 --> 01:00.226
As you can see, we offer
a full range of services.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.645
- "Round the World"?
- Our deluxe package.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.815
Offers all the services
of A, B, and C.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.779
- How much?
- $1,000.

01:12.156 --> 01:15.616
And satisfaction
is guaranteed. Twice.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.203
- I'll get the money.
- I'll get ready.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.467
Harrington?

01:34.845 --> 01:38.514
Harrington, what are you
doing up there?

01:40.309 --> 01:41.726
All right, now don't
take this personally

01:41.852 --> 01:43.060
but you're gonna have to go...

01:43.228 --> 01:44.103
Fran.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.943
Is this okay?

01:56.074 --> 01:57.241
Fran.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.001
Fran, you all right?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.547
Oh, God.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.093
Fran?

02:42.663 --> 02:45.915
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at 500 North Sycamore.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.961
I don't know,
my friend collapsed.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.790
And what were you doing
when you fainted?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.712
- We were just...
- Looking for her cat.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.756
And have you
banged your head recently?

03:35.883 --> 03:36.716
No.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.847
Is this a motion sickness
patch?

03:42.973 --> 03:46.475
I must have forgotten to take it off.
I just got back from a trip.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.855
Scopolamine can cause
dizziness and blurred vision.

03:50.981 --> 03:54.650
You probably hit your head when you
fell, and that caused the blackout.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.403
I thought those patches were supposed
to prevent you from getting sick.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.946
Every drug has a side effect.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.740
But it might be a good idea
to keep your eye on her

04:00.866 --> 04:03.034
for the next few hours
to make sure she's okay.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.327
Actually...

04:04.453 --> 04:05.620
She has to get back to work.

04:07.873 --> 04:08.706
Is it important?

04:08.832 --> 04:12.376
We just don't like people
to be alone after they leave here.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.503
I'm fine. Really.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.964
- I'm...
- Fran?

04:18.550 --> 04:19.759
Fran?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.804
I got a seizure. Code cart.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.764
What's wrong with her?

04:24.890 --> 04:26.015
I have no idea.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.851
Where's House?

04:30.979 --> 04:33.689
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie! I want my blankie!

04:33.815 --> 04:37.193
Antique vintner's cane.
Cost me $900.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.736
It had a corkscrew in it.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.821
That would explain
the vintner's reference.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.240
It could be used as a weapon
against the pilot.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.076
Only if he's stuck
in a bottle of zinfandel.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.994
You'll get it back
when we land.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.372
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

04:49.498 --> 04:52.124
Give her 20 milligrams
of antihistamine. Could save her life.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.709
'Cause if she doesn't shut up,
I'll kill her.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.337
Delivering goodwill
to yet another continent.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.547
You only forced me to
deliver a speech, not goodwill.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.467
You gave
a three-minute speech.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.970
You know how much WHO accreditation
means to the hospital?

05:04.096 --> 05:05.930
Well, it may have been short,
but it had girth.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.891
And the room service thing
was just spiteful.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.477
- I was hungry.
- $300 for a bottle of wine.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.812
I was thirsty.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.231
$120 on video services.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.190
I was lonely.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.527
That's 500 in expenses
I can't justify.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.445
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.406
Right.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.824
Here you are, sir.
You're welcome.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.328
Welcome aboard, Mr. House.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.080
You're right here in 2-A.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.335
Ms. Cuddy you're in the next cabin
and to the left, 9-C.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.462
No, I booked two
first-class tickets.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.589
- This must be a mistake.
- No mistake.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.759
I just arranged for
a $500 fare reduction.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.136
Expense problem solved.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.228
- Where did you travel?
- Duluth.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.814
- To visit my sister.
- Really?

05:57.649 --> 05:59.316
Is this her artwork?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
"Fire butt"?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.992
I was a little drunk.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.827
Where were you a little drunk?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.667
I turned 58 last March.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.087
Same age my mother was
when she died.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.591
Next week I packed a bag,
I went to JFK,

06:23.717 --> 06:27.845
looked at the big board, took the first
plane that went to a warm place.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.140
- Caracas.
- Oh, my God.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.267
Did you drink the water?
Eat salads?

06:33.477 --> 06:35.269
- Any raw foods?
- Yup.

06:35.854 --> 06:36.687
And?

06:40.525 --> 06:42.068
I also did mescal shooters

06:42.194 --> 06:46.614
and snorted cocaine from
a homosexual man's stomach.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.452
- Did you have sex?
- No.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.499
Not with him.
I had sex with El Gordo.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.461
He was a large man.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.504
Oh, my God.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.176
I never do things like that.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.889
I should have gone to visit my sister.
It was stupid.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.391
That's why I'm sick, isn't it?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.896
It's possible.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.533
Here you are.
Rib eye, medium rare.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.035
- Thank you.
- Some more Pinot Grigio?

07:33.495 --> 07:36.664
No. I think I will
switch to the Syrah.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.680
Sir, are you all right?

07:53.181 --> 07:54.473
He's drunk.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.486
See?

08:09.865 --> 08:11.532
Does anyone speak Korean?

08:13.118 --> 08:14.743
Is anyone a doctor?

08:17.581 --> 08:18.664
Yes.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.376
I'll go get her.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.857
What do you want?

08:44.983 --> 08:48.235
Do you really think I was gonna leave
you stuck back here for 18 hours?

08:48.653 --> 08:49.653
Go on, enjoy.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.698
With the Vicodin and the wine
I could sleep anywhere.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.497
Thank you.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.171
We should put her back
on the scopolamine patch.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.840
She can't wear motion sickness patches
for the rest of her life.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.552
No, but if it does relive her symptoms
it'll narrow down our search.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.055
Anything else
you two guys wanna agree on?

09:16.181 --> 09:17.556
You have a problem
with us agreeing?

09:17.682 --> 09:19.725
No, I have a problem with the other
thing you're doing,

09:19.851 --> 09:21.393
which makes me question
your motive for agreeing.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.354
I'll put her
back on the patch. What else?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.064
It's gotta be something
neurological.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.982
We should do a CT,
look for a brain tumor.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.817
Could also be an allergy
or something environmental.

09:28.944 --> 09:29.902
We should check her home.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.529
Bit more likely she got
sick in Caracas than in New Jersey.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.907
Right, I forgot.
There are no toxins in the US.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.201
I think I'm starting to
feel sorry for House.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.621
Get a tox screen, chem-20,
STD panel, blood cultures.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.082
Then you run a CT
and you check her house.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.876
Please.

09:51.883 --> 09:52.716
Not funny.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.260
Wasn't supposed
to be funny ha-ha.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.596
Fever, headache,
severe abdominal pain,

09:57.722 --> 09:59.807
and a rash
all over his lower back.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.101
It's serious.
Maybe contagious.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.854
We just attended a symposium
on pandemics

10:05.981 --> 10:07.731
and you run right into one
on the flight home.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.691
Talk about a small world.

10:08.817 --> 10:09.775
If it's meningococcus,

10:09.901 --> 10:12.111
half the passengers on this plane could
get infected and die

10:12.237 --> 10:13.862
before we reach New York.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.698
- Is someone sick?
- No.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.742
Someone has a hangover.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.578
He had a snootload
of Bloody Marys before dinner.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.665
Watch the movie.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.213
That booze did not give him the rash.
It is textbook meningococcus.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.049
It's also textbook
allergic reaction to pollen,

10:34.175 --> 10:37.678
peanuts, and the semen-stained
polyester blanket he's lying on.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.680
Mr. Peng's throwing up again.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.058
- We have to turn around.
- What? Why do we have to...

10:43.226 --> 10:44.935
We don't. You misunderstood.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.896
Dr. Cuddy just meant
that he might feel less nauseous

10:48.023 --> 10:49.857
if he was facing
in a different direction.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.734
She didn't mean to panic
a planeload of people.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.610
We're about to head
over the North Pole.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.572
We don't turn back now,
the next ER's 15 hours away.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.782
He'll be fine.
I'm a doctor, too.

10:58.908 --> 10:59.992
You haven't examined him.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.412
Korean male, mid 30s,
5'9", 160, bald,

11:03.538 --> 11:06.623
scar on the right side of his jaw, medic
alert bracelet on his left wrist

11:06.750 --> 11:09.084
indicating that he's allergic to,
at least, penicillin.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.379
Without any way to do an LP
or rule out meningococcus,

11:12.505 --> 11:14.590
our only choice
is to assume the worst.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.260
Good point. On the other hand,
I am a board-certified specialist

11:18.386 --> 11:19.636
in infectious disease.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.389
She assigns parking spaces.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.435
Please let me know
if he gets any worse.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.788
Think we should feed the cat?

11:46.331 --> 11:47.373
Bowl's full.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.834
If he wants it, he can get it.
Cadmium yellow?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.420
Heavy metal poisoning would explain
the ataxia and the seizures.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.589
Not unless she was painting
with her tongue.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.341
Was Foreman right?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.636
Did you agree with me
because of our relationship?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.930
- "Relationship"?
- You know what I mean.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.016
You mean because of
our lack of a relationship.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.227
I mean, because
we're having sex.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.354
Yes. Foreman's right.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.606
I thought you were completely wrong
about the medicine,

12:12.732 --> 12:13.816
but agreed with you anyway

12:13.942 --> 12:17.277
because I figured then
you'd do me in some old lady's home.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.696
Then well played.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.118
Come on, we're supposed to be
looking for toxins.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.163
We agreed
it was a brain tumor. What?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.210
He's watching.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.878
Haven't you had
anybody watch before?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.983
- Is that guy really sick?
- No.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.444
- He's all better.
- I don't believe you.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.157
- Look that way.
- Why?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.869
Because you're gonna throw up
and I don't want it on me.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.841
I'll get some towels.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.387
Give her a banana. Monkey see,
monkey barf. You smell vomit...

13:30.894 --> 13:33.645
Okay. Wasn't expecting that.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.321
I need help.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.323
Who doesn't?

13:44.449 --> 13:45.699
I need someone to talk to.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.373
Can you say, "Crikey, mate"?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.584
- Crikey, mate.
- Perfect.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.213
Now no matter what I say,
you agree with me, okay?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.715
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.552
And you disagree
with everything I say.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.763
Sorry. Not understanding.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.640
That's close enough.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.893
And you get morally outraged
at everything I say.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.937
That's a permanent marker,
you know.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.730
Wow.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.440
You guys are good.

14:18.900 --> 14:23.362
We are looking for the simplest way
to explain these symptoms.

14:25.990 --> 14:30.035
Organophosphate poisoning. Some
international flights spray pesticides.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.163
Could be.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.790
Sorry, English not so nice.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.500
Is this a joke?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.210
Just passed the halfway mark.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.837
- Can't turn around. Nice call.
- No worries.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.174
- We think it's pesticide poisoning.
- We don't spray these flights.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.425
Dramamine overdose.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.718
Wouldn't
explain the fever.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.720
- Jet lag.
- Wouldn't explain the abdominal pain.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.139
- Deep vein thrombosis.
- Wouldn't explain the nausea.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.766
Food poisoning.
What was on the menu?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.352
Steak and sea bass
in First Class.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.145
Fettuccine
and seafood kebabs in Economy.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.481
Since when does food poisoning
cause a rash?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.693
Sea bass, seafood kebabs?
He had the sea bass.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.194
Please tell me
she had the kebabs.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.655
I think so.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.073
Ciguatera poisoning.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.659
It's an instant-onset toxin.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.453
Symptoms include...
E. All of the above.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.957
It's only found in certain kinds
of tropical game fish such as...

15:17.375 --> 15:18.667
Sea bass?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.377
Make sure you get
a resume from him.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.467
- Hello?
- Excuse me.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.471
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief
announcement concerning your meals.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.099
If you ate the sea bass
or the seafood kebabs,

15:34.225 --> 15:35.809
you have ingested
a dangerous toxin.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.229
However, if you proceed to the restrooms
both on your left and right

15:39.355 --> 15:41.690
at the rear of the plane
and vomit as soon as possible,

15:41.816 --> 15:44.359
the toxic effect should be minimal.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.574
Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.494
Meningococcus makes
just as much sense.

15:54.746 --> 15:55.746
I know.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.591
What did you find?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.635
Nothing in her house.
Big waste of time.

16:09.761 --> 16:10.594
Medically.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.763
CT was a complete waste.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.098
She was negative for tumors,
her blood was negative for drugs,

16:15.224 --> 16:18.769
heavy metals, tropical diseases,
food poisoning, and STDs.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.146
Also no sign of
lead poisoning or sepsis.

16:21.272 --> 16:24.608
Apparently Venezuelan
tattoo parlors have standards after all.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.401
Good to know.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.236
We sure she's even sick?

16:28.363 --> 16:29.988
Two more seizures
in the last two hours.

16:30.323 --> 16:34.284
Which is slower than she was having
them before you put the patch back on.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.496
I'm an idiot.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.916
She's exposed herself to so much crap
I just assumed it was a zebra.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.502
It's breast cancer.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.505
Since when is breast cancer
treatable by motion sickness meds?

16:46.631 --> 16:49.883
It's not. But the inflammation
caused by the paraneoplastic syndrome

16:50.009 --> 16:53.637
caused by the cancer can be reduced
by anticholinergics.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.771
Hey, here you go.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.189
Is he gonna die?

17:06.526 --> 17:09.277
We're doing all we can. We don't know
what's wrong with him yet.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.779
Am I gonna die?

17:10.905 --> 17:11.822
No.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.865
Here, chew on these.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.751
Good news is all the pilots
are red meat men.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.380
Although I was kind of looking forward
to landing this puppy myself.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.298
Peng's getting worse.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.717
That makes sense.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.094
First Class ate before Coach.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.221
He digested more of his food
before he threw up.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.558
Or you're wrong and we're gonna start
seeing neurological symptoms soon.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.227
Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.273
We're not gonna see ataxia.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.692
- You're so sure you're right.
- No.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.069
It's just hard to show clumsiness
when you're lying moaning

17:51.195 --> 17:52.779
in a fetal position.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.328
Hey, stand up.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.623
Does nobody
speak Korean on this flight?

18:03.750 --> 18:04.666
I assumed you did.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.752
I know how to ask him
if his sister's over 18,

18:06.878 --> 18:08.003
I just don't think
that's gonna help.

18:08.129 --> 18:11.757
Hey, stand up. Stand up.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.261
Don't play the cripple card
with me.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.618
Oh, hi. I'm leaving.

18:40.870 --> 18:41.870
Work.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.079
Okay.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.540
- Important client.
- Sure.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.048
Listen.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.969
Are you close?

18:58.596 --> 18:59.429
Why?

19:02.683 --> 19:05.477
She needs a mammogram.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.853
Oh, God.

19:07.104 --> 19:11.191
I know I'm throwing a lot at you.
She just has no family in town.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.612
And I really think she could
use a friend right now.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.625
Okay. Put your hand here.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.381
You don't have to stay.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.218
No, it's no problem.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.719
But why?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.930
You don't even know me.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.267
You gotta be scared.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.313
- I almost hope it's breast cancer.
- No.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.773
Then it wouldn't be my fault.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.025
Whatever it is,
it's not your fault.

19:54.986 --> 19:58.446
That's not true.
You can control things.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.615
Not everything.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.202
But you don't have to take stupid risks.
I was being an idiot.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.495
You were having fun.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.875
You have regrets?

20:12.336 --> 20:13.920
Yeah.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.047
Robin?

20:27.393 --> 20:28.560
Hold still.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.608
Good.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.155
Okay, we're gonna get just one more.
I'm sorry, I know it hurts.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.823
It's not that.

20:42.491 --> 20:46.202
It's my eye. My right eye.

20:47.705 --> 20:48.955
I can't see.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.794
It's definitely ataxia.
And it's definitely a rash.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.005
You gonna look at it for five more
minutes before concluding

20:57.131 --> 20:58.256
it's also definitely a leg?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.633
Thin leg.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.217
- It's been in a cast.
- So?

21:01.344 --> 21:02.636
So it could be
radiation poisoning.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.762
From a broken leg?

21:04.055 --> 21:05.096
From the x-rays
they took of it.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.348
He could break
every bone in his body

21:06.515 --> 21:08.850
and still not have enough x-rays
to cause radiation sickness.

21:09.143 --> 21:12.604
Unless those x-rays were performed
in Wankoff, North Korea,

21:12.730 --> 21:15.231
by a third-grade dropout
with a 50-year-old imager.

21:15.358 --> 21:17.025
Which accounts
for the absence of fur.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.319
Radiation poisoning accounts
for all his symptoms.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.572
I have hair. I haven't had an x-ray
since I got my teeth whitened.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.783
You're pregnant.

21:24.909 --> 21:25.742
I'm what?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.870
Explains the nausea,
abdominal pains, fever,

21:28.996 --> 21:32.415
and why you're stuffing
your 36Cs into a 34B bra.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.375
And her rash?

21:33.501 --> 21:35.460
PUPPPs. Common pregnancy rash.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.711
I can't be pregnant.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.171
You a virgin?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.882
- No, but...
- You're pregnant. Mazel tov.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.134
Let's get him into the chair.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.137
Two different diagnoses.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.014
I thought you didn't
believe in coincidences.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.683
I believe in statistics.

21:50.184 --> 21:53.979
Two hundred passengers
on the plane, 10 should be gay,

21:54.605 --> 21:57.816
two should be with child,
and one should be incredibly annoying

21:57.942 --> 21:59.818
- with an extra ass chromosome.
- House.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.071
Get him some iodized salt to protect
his thyroid. I'm going back...

22:03.197 --> 22:04.280
House.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.450
You're wrong.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.806
I said we should have turned back.
You should have listened to me.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.599
Now we're eight miles
over the Arctic...

22:31.767 --> 22:34.519
I'm trying to listen
to you now, so shut up.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.565
Heart's fine.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.609
Breasts are firm.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.069
Is it contagious?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.030
A lot of the passengers
are scared.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.448
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.284
- Is there something to worry about?
- Yeah.

22:50.828 --> 22:54.789
Tell them there's nothing to worry
about. And get me a flashlight.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.920
Cover your left eye with this.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.557
Photophobia.

23:12.683 --> 23:15.560
Symptom of meningitis.
We need antibiotics.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.104
I'll call down
to the pharmacy.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.443
You're creeping me out.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.569
Then get me a lab.

23:25.446 --> 23:28.531
Pseudomonas smell yeasty,
staph smells musty,

23:29.158 --> 23:31.826
and some liver disease
smell of ammonia.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.412
House. I'm not in heat.

23:34.789 --> 23:38.625
Citrus-y on the nose with a blush
of toasted coconut.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.430
I need to get a better look
at your rash.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.723
Use your imagination.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.811
Fine, should I go with Lifeguard Cuddy
or Mother Superior Cuddy?

23:57.978 --> 24:00.021
Three more passengers
are sick.

24:00.523 --> 24:03.942
If we don't get drugs, we're gonna have
a lot of dead passengers.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.994
Blindness in her right eye
indicates it's not breast cancer.

24:15.121 --> 24:15.954
It's likely neurological.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.539
I just met her today.

24:29.677 --> 24:30.844
You should go.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.345
She needs someone here.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.472
That's not your job.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.873
Please let me know
that she's okay.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.547
It's just sex.

25:07.756 --> 25:08.631
There's no such thing.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.301
Other eye.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.137
Are you saying women can't separate
the physical from the emotional?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.347
No one does it well,
women do it worse.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.600
You just want us to stop
because you think it's affecting...

25:18.726 --> 25:20.351
Me. Yeah.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.856
Polyspikes are over 01 and 02.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.774
That's her left eye.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.735
Burst suppression
on every lead.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.406
Fran?

25:37.328 --> 25:38.494
She's comatose.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.792
Nothing. Nothing.

25:45.628 --> 25:46.628
Nothing.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.422
Come on, nobody has no meds!

25:52.676 --> 25:54.761
- Excuse me.
- Open your mouth.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.264
Where's the acyclovir?

25:58.390 --> 25:59.599
I'm not on any meds.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.061
Well, you better get some.
You've got herpes.

26:12.613 --> 26:16.407
What do you know? He's got some.
This must be your lucky day.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.161
This is for real.
People are sick.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.249
Some of us will be deplaning in
body bags unless you cough up.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.710
- Here. Over here.
- Thank you. Thank you.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.088
Thank you.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.216
God bless you.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.344
Her brain is shutting down
because of intracranial pressure.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.720
Or her nerves are dying.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.430
Because of
the increased pressure.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.431
She has a bleed in her brain.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.516
You said the CT showed...

26:41.642 --> 26:44.602
No tumors. But if she has an AVM
leading to a cerebral hemorrhage,

26:44.728 --> 26:46.896
we could've missed it.
She needs a burr hole to relieve...

26:47.064 --> 26:49.440
You wanna drill into her brain
because of an invisible bleed

26:49.566 --> 26:51.192
the CT couldn't see?

26:51.318 --> 26:53.820
We should do an LP to confirm
the presence of red blood cells.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.239
And her brain herniates
and then she dies.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.324
Right. Better to kill her
in the OR.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.701
Chase, what do you think?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.244
Here's a cliffhanger.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.664
I think it would help to know
what she has

27:04.790 --> 27:07.333
before we start digging into her brain.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.213
Might be better to
play it safe to start. Do an LP.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.508
Sex better be damn good.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.519
Lot of apples,
not many candy bars.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.146
Any antibiotics?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.315
Three caps of Augmentin.

27:30.858 --> 27:31.858
For six patients.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.486
Give them to Peng.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.904
He's allergic to penicillin.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.823
The First Aid kit
has two epi pens.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.784
If he has a severe reaction,
10 epi pens won't save him.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.578
- You take the pills.
- He's worse.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.371
He's a guy who doesn't
speak English.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.581
Give him the meds.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.000
If it's not meningitis,
we're risking his life

27:49.126 --> 27:50.501
and flushing meds down the toilet.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.880
Then do an LP on him.
If it's clear, you win.

27:54.006 --> 27:58.634
If it's cloudy he gets
the Augmentin. And we risk a reaction.

28:00.054 --> 28:03.639
Sounds like a plan. All except for the
part where we don't have an LP needle.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.809
And the shaking of the plane means
I'll probably pierce his spinal cord

28:07.019 --> 28:10.980
and cripple him for life. But, I mean,
it totally sounds like a plan.

28:12.232 --> 28:17.195
You're right. Let him die.
Give me the meds.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.695
- Got it.
- Damn.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.197
What is it?

29:43.407 --> 29:45.491
Shut up. Don't get hysterical.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.160
Just tell me
what the hell it is.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.164
House. We should have
turned back.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.166
We should have turned back.

29:55.169 --> 29:56.169
House.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.342
Hold this.

30:10.601 --> 30:11.684
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:11.810 --> 30:15.771
we have a passenger with a confirmed
case of bacterial meningitis.

30:16.690 --> 30:20.485
Unless we land as soon as possible,
the passenger will not survive.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.696
It's very likely that some
of you have been infected as well.

30:24.239 --> 30:27.158
As soon as you start feeling symptoms,
we need to isolate you

30:27.284 --> 30:31.537
in the First Class cabin.
Fever, rash, nausea,

30:31.955 --> 30:36.417
and in the late stages
tremor in the left hand.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.714
- I've got that.
- Oh, God.

30:46.553 --> 30:50.223
- What do we do?
- Break out the bubbly.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.183
Yo, listen up.

30:55.020 --> 31:00.024
The bad news is, you have an illness.
The good news is, it's not meningitis.

31:01.735 --> 31:04.570
It's not fatal,
it's just embarrassing.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.865
It's conversion disorder,
more commonly known as mass hysteria.

31:09.243 --> 31:12.912
It happens often in high-anxiety
situations, especially to women.

31:13.038 --> 31:16.332
I know it sounds sexist, but science
says you're weak and soft.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.291
What can I do?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.335
House, you're wrong.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.836
Look at my hand.

31:20.963 --> 31:22.797
Yeah. Look at her hand.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.882
Shaking left hand.
What is that a symptom of?

31:25.259 --> 31:27.718
Not meningitis. It's basically
a symptom of nothing.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.513
I put the idea
into their heads and watched it happen.

31:30.639 --> 31:33.641
Same thing Peng cruelly did
with the puking and the rash.

31:33.767 --> 31:34.809
The rash is in my head?

31:35.018 --> 31:37.061
Your mind controls your body.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.814
If it thinks you're sick,
it makes you sick.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.358
It just started.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.780
If you'll all just calm down,
your symptoms will soon go away.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.282
And to facilitate
this process,

31:49.408 --> 31:53.661
your flight crew will move through the
cabin with a complimentary bar service.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.831
Thank you and, as always,
have a pleasant flight.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.675
- Still feel like puking?
- No.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.063
How did you know?

32:21.189 --> 32:22.315
LP was negative.

32:22.983 --> 32:25.818
I came up with an alternate theory
and I tested it.

32:26.737 --> 32:30.448
Couldn't have done it without you.
Rage is a symptom of mass hysteria.

32:31.033 --> 32:35.202
Just one more thing to clean up.
Peng set off the mass hysteria.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.747
What set off Peng?

32:40.500 --> 32:42.918
- He really is dying.
- Yeah.

32:43.253 --> 32:45.630
I haven't the
faintest idea why.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.849
What's extension pasturing?

32:57.100 --> 33:00.645
It's when you're molested
by a priest's cousin.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.566
Do we really need these three?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.401
Worried they'll make you
look bad?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.988
Could be symptomatic
of head trauma, cerebral infarction,

33:11.114 --> 33:14.158
or intracranial hemorrhage.
Thoughts?

33:14.618 --> 33:15.660
How long until we land?

33:15.869 --> 33:16.786
Too long to wait.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.330
His head's as smooth
as a baby's bottom, no bumps.

33:19.456 --> 33:20.790
So I think we can
rule out head trauma.

33:20.916 --> 33:24.251
But you gotta choose between
what's left, a clog or a leak?

33:24.378 --> 33:25.878
You're talking of toilet?

33:26.088 --> 33:28.714
House, is this
actually helpful?

33:29.758 --> 33:31.050
Not so far.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.220
What about syphilis?

33:34.596 --> 33:37.932
Well, first of all, he apparently speaks
a language no one else speaks,

33:38.058 --> 33:40.226
which makes talking up
the ladies a little rough.

33:40.394 --> 33:41.477
We're flying out of Singapore.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.439
If he has a credit card and a condom,
he can get anything he wants.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.609
What?

33:49.986 --> 33:51.320
Condoms.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.035
He has focal limb paralysis.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.454
His legs got paralyzed
by a condom?

34:00.580 --> 34:01.956
No, by cocaine.

34:02.249 --> 34:03.791
It was inside the condom.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.961
It's now spreading
through his digestive tract.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.462
You think he's a mule.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.297
I think he's a jackass.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.551
- We're gonna have to operate.
- Cool!

34:34.990 --> 34:36.490
- They're gonna kill her.
- We were wrong.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.367
Which means Foreman was right.

34:39.828 --> 34:43.330
Maybe Foreman's right about us, too.
Maybe we should just stop all this.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.832
I mean, if it's
affecting our jobs.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.584
It's not affecting our jobs.

34:46.960 --> 34:51.255
We had sex in a patient's bedroom.
A bedroom we were examining for toxins.

34:51.381 --> 34:53.215
Yeah, our judgment's right
on the mark.

34:53.341 --> 34:56.385
All right. No more sex in patient's
homes, no more sex with cats watching.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.929
Anywhere else you wanna
cross off the list?

34:59.514 --> 35:01.140
- The bowl.
- What?

35:03.393 --> 35:04.727
Has she eaten
since she's been here?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.604
She's been sick
since she's been here.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.773
- What if it's a symptom?
- Well, why would you think...

35:08.899 --> 35:10.441
The bowl was full.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.372
You're gonna need to
hold him down. He's not gonna like this.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.126
Do you really think
he's a mule?

35:29.252 --> 35:30.127
Fits the symptoms.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.756
You sure he's not contagious?

35:34.257 --> 35:35.090
Pretty much.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.802
You can't be pretty much sure.
Means you're not sure.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.720
Oh, aren't you clever?

35:42.182 --> 35:43.516
Come on.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.520
I know you're pretty much
unconscious,

35:47.646 --> 35:51.273
but as has been pointed out
to me, pretty much doesn't mean squat.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.591
Okay, hold him tight.

37:00.302 --> 37:03.637
The faster we do this, the less likely
he is to die of shock.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.398
Tighter.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.491
- Sorry.
- Do that again.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.078
Ease off and then press down.

37:49.392 --> 37:52.269
Pressure on his joints
relieves his pain.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.521
- Okay.
- Wrong again.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.857
Where's his wallet?

39:01.256 --> 39:03.465
Scuba certification card.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.345
- Big deal. I have one of these.
- Yeah.

39:09.097 --> 39:13.142
But do you also have a receipt from
Tekong's Scuba Rental dated yesterday?

39:14.644 --> 39:18.480
Tell the Captain to drop as low
as he can, under 5,000 feet.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.899
- We're at 38,000...
- Peng's got the bends.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.109
He went diving yesterday.

39:22.235 --> 39:25.029
Like an idiot, he surfaced too quickly,
and like a bigger idiot,

39:25.155 --> 39:28.365
he boarded a flight which is pressurized
to 8,000 feet above sea level.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.034
Low pressure is killing him.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.620
Tell the pilot to dive until we can
club baby seals out of the window.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.373
And get him some oxygen.

39:47.343 --> 39:51.513
Fifty years ago, it was one estate. The
two homes shared an electrical system.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.891
Unfortunately,
the exterminator didn't know that,

39:54.017 --> 39:55.684
so when they fumigated
next door,

39:55.810 --> 39:58.479
the poison gas flowed through the
old pipe and into your house.

39:58.605 --> 40:01.648
The scopolamine patch
was masking the effects of the poison.

40:01.775 --> 40:06.153
You'll have to stay here for a few more
days, but after that you should be fine.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.531
I'm sorry about your cat.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.909
And your hair.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.122
For 12 years, Harrington
never left the property.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.960
I thought I was being punished
for going away,

40:23.671 --> 40:28.383
but really I was being
punished for coming home.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.704
- Thank you.
- I saved your life. You owe me.

40:57.831 --> 40:58.664
I wasn't sick.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.125
But you didn't know that.
You owe me.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.668
I know it now.

41:03.086 --> 41:07.339
Your mind convinced your body
to get a rash, photophobia, vomit.

41:07.465 --> 41:11.468
How do you know it wouldn't have
shut down your cold, cold heart next?

41:14.347 --> 41:15.722
I don't owe you.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.601
You're mean.

41:20.854 --> 41:24.690
That's how I compensate
for being weak and soft.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.864
I just wanted to
say thank you.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.407
You're extremely welcome.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.367
And I'm in New York
every Monday.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.203
Are you handicap accessible?

41:49.883 --> 41:51.133
Hi, Robin?

41:52.385 --> 41:55.095
This is Dr. Wilson.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.931
Fran's doctor. James.

42:01.311 --> 42:04.563
It was a toxin. We caught it in time,
and she's gonna be fine.

42:06.149 --> 42:07.357
Yeah, it is.

42:12.155 --> 42:16.408
Listen, I was just wondering if you were
coming back in again to visit.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.996
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.372
Think even House
would be impressed.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.458
I don't know about that.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.293
Any idea how
you wanna celebrate?

42:29.130 --> 42:30.255
What?

42:31.507 --> 42:32.507
I want more.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.177
I thought you were getting
a little worn out by...

42:35.303 --> 42:37.054
No, that's not what I meant.

42:38.348 --> 42:39.348
I know.

42:40.183 --> 42:43.936
I was just hoping you'd take the hint
and pretend you never said that.

42:44.729 --> 42:46.813
I want this to be
more than it is.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.690
I thought we were clear.

42:49.025 --> 42:50.859
In the beginning,
but you can't tell me...

42:50.985 --> 42:54.238
Yes, I can. And I don't.

42:57.158 --> 42:59.534
It was fun. That's it.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.540
And now it's over.
