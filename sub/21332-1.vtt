00:40.136 --> 00:41.919

be playing with my money, dog.

00:41.919 --> 00:43.275

00:44.966 --> 00:46.805
- No, I need my change.

00:46.805 --> 00:47.638

00:54.793 --> 00:56.335
(scoffing)

00:56.335 --> 00:57.579
Shit, what the fuck.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.400
- I mean damn, I'll pay
for your little groceries

00:59.400 --> 01:00.644
and shit, baby.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.075
- Nigga, the only thing
you need to be paying

01:02.075 --> 01:03.728
is attention.

01:03.728 --> 01:04.561
- You're right.

01:04.561 --> 01:05.394
Let me help you up.

01:05.394 --> 01:06.254
- No, just grab my juice real quick

01:06.254 --> 01:08.671
before it goes in the street.

01:12.310 --> 01:14.372
- (scoffing) Excuse you.

01:14.372 --> 01:16.471
Nigga, now you can help me up?

01:16.471 --> 01:17.549
- I'm saying I just tried to help you up

01:17.549 --> 01:18.570
and you ain't want my help.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.939
I had already said sorry.

01:19.939 --> 01:21.592
- Shut up.

01:21.592 --> 01:23.004
You need to stop being so damn sorry

01:23.004 --> 01:27.004
and watch where the fuck
you're going next time.

01:27.858 --> 01:28.753
- You're right.

01:28.753 --> 01:29.989
Hey yo.

01:29.989 --> 01:30.825
Hey, yo.

01:30.825 --> 01:31.658
Yo.

01:33.351 --> 01:34.856
I ain't get your name.

01:34.856 --> 01:39.023
- (chuckles) I wasn't giving it away.

01:59.014 --> 02:02.288
- Damn, nigga that's my cousin's wallet.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.705
- You wild motherfucker, E.

02:03.705 --> 02:05.446
- Damn, you're just trying
to save everybody, ain't you?

02:05.446 --> 02:06.279
Damn.

02:07.304 --> 02:09.858
- See, momma used to always say

02:09.858 --> 02:12.900
how can a woman get to know your approach

02:12.900 --> 02:15.825
if you never approach her at all?

02:15.825 --> 02:19.099
The worst a woman can say is no.

02:19.099 --> 02:21.932
Man, that woman taught me a lot.

02:21.932 --> 02:23.790
But she passed away.

02:23.790 --> 02:25.206
I had to take on the responsibility

02:25.206 --> 02:28.295
of taking care of my little brother, JR

02:28.295 --> 02:30.545
and my younger sister, Bre.

02:31.499 --> 02:34.076
- I know but I wanna do it on my own.

02:34.076 --> 02:35.748
- I can understand that.

02:35.748 --> 02:37.188
I can understand that.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.581
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:38.581 --> 02:41.437
You need Kool-Aid, brother.

02:41.437 --> 02:43.062
- [Bre] Yeah get that red Kool-Aid.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.895
- Don't forget the Kool-Aid.

02:45.895 --> 02:48.145
(mumbling)

02:50.284 --> 02:51.282
What's up, bro?

02:51.282 --> 02:52.258
You alright?

02:52.258 --> 02:53.604
- I'm alright.

02:53.604 --> 02:55.416
Trying to bag man.

02:55.416 --> 02:57.249
This time, one on one.

03:00.355 --> 03:01.522
Take a shower.

03:02.479 --> 03:04.868
Got a little female about to come over.

03:04.868 --> 03:07.027
Bout to get me some.

03:07.027 --> 03:10.231
(both laughing)

03:10.231 --> 03:11.253
- You crazy.

03:11.253 --> 03:14.550
- [Murda] It's obvious we ain't have much.

03:14.550 --> 03:17.558
But the little we did have,
we had to sacrifice to get.

03:17.558 --> 03:18.891
For one another.

03:27.569 --> 03:28.402
- Hey.

03:29.612 --> 03:30.726
Baby, what happened to them heels

03:30.726 --> 03:32.932
I bought you the other day?

03:32.932 --> 03:35.672
- I fell and broke it, Renzo.

03:35.672 --> 03:37.414
- You're acting like it's my fault.

03:37.414 --> 03:39.155
- No it wasn't your fault.

03:39.155 --> 03:41.106
But I know what is.

03:41.106 --> 03:43.358
All these hoes that keep
calling and playing on my phone

03:43.358 --> 03:45.275
is for sure your fault.

03:49.093 --> 03:50.556
- I don't know what you're talking about.

03:50.556 --> 03:52.312
- You don't know what I'm talking about?

03:52.312 --> 03:53.589
- [Renzo] No I don't.

03:53.589 --> 03:57.745
- It is so crazy you don't
know what I'm talking about.

03:57.745 --> 04:00.857
You don't know no bitch named Kelly?

04:00.857 --> 04:03.774
And you wasn't with her last night?

04:07.265 --> 04:08.098
- Kelly.

04:11.213 --> 04:13.463
No, that don't ring a bell.

04:15.996 --> 04:17.529
Hey, you seen my watch?

04:17.529 --> 04:19.851
- Nigga, fuck your watch.

04:19.851 --> 04:23.608
And this bitch had the nerve
to ask me who I was, Renzo.

04:23.608 --> 04:26.533
Meaning you're not even telling
these hoes that you've got

04:26.533 --> 04:30.700
a soon to be wife, so they can
at least stay in their place.

04:32.736 --> 04:34.478
- You need to quit worrying
about these bitches.

04:34.478 --> 04:36.103
- It's not the bitches I'm worried about.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.311
It's you.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.309
- Me?

04:38.309 --> 04:39.586
- Nigga, yes, you.

04:39.586 --> 04:42.256
If you had control over the
weak ass shit that you're doing,

04:42.256 --> 04:44.996
and controlling your casual encounters,

04:44.996 --> 04:49.163
none of this shit would get
back to me in the first place.

04:51.817 --> 04:53.349
- Encounters.

04:53.349 --> 04:55.230
(chortles)

04:55.230 --> 04:56.902
- What's so funny?

04:56.902 --> 04:58.690
That's what you're doing.

04:58.690 --> 05:01.174
Encountering bitches casually.

05:01.174 --> 05:03.241
You're such a joke.

05:03.241 --> 05:05.354
You've got a loyal ass, grinding woman

05:05.354 --> 05:07.444
right in front of you,

05:07.444 --> 05:09.394
and this is how you're doing me.

05:09.394 --> 05:11.144
But it's cool though.

05:12.065 --> 05:14.294
(phone chimes)

05:14.294 --> 05:15.703
- You know what baby, I
do be tripping sometimes.

05:15.703 --> 05:16.536
I'm tripping.

05:16.536 --> 05:17.953
- Don't touch me.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.456
And you have a better day.

05:39.254 --> 05:40.392
- [Woman In Yellow] Look
at your little puppy.

05:40.392 --> 05:43.142
Oh my God, where did you get her?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.988
- Girl, Blade got it for me.

05:45.988 --> 05:47.451
- Oh what kind of puppy is it?

05:47.451 --> 05:48.704
- A chihuahua.

05:48.704 --> 05:50.070
Her name is Chloe.

05:50.070 --> 05:51.788
- Adorable.

05:51.788 --> 05:53.298

05:53.298 --> 05:54.131
- Chloe is so cute and little.

05:54.131 --> 05:55.620
Oh my goodness.

05:55.620 --> 05:56.828
Look at her little body.

05:56.828 --> 05:57.786
She's so cute.

05:57.786 --> 05:58.619
- Hey y'all.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.835
- Hey boo.

06:00.835 --> 06:02.437
Never called me back last night.

06:02.437 --> 06:04.271
- Girl, some bullshit popped off.

06:04.271 --> 06:05.270
- Bullshit like what?

06:05.270 --> 06:06.825
- So how about this weak ass bitch

06:06.825 --> 06:08.381
had the nerve to come to my DM,

06:08.381 --> 06:09.867
questioning me about Dre's ass?

06:09.867 --> 06:11.284
- What.
- It goes down in the DM.

06:11.284 --> 06:12.654
Let me see.

06:12.654 --> 06:13.487
Wow.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.160

06:16.160 --> 06:17.135
- So what happened?

06:17.135 --> 06:18.900
- That bitch got me fucked up.

06:18.900 --> 06:19.921
- Are they together?

06:19.921 --> 06:21.756
- Girl, that's some bullshit
over there, right there.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.010
- Exactly.

06:23.010 --> 06:25.332

06:25.332 --> 06:26.818

06:28.490 --> 06:30.370

06:30.370 --> 06:31.369
Where they do that at?

06:31.369 --> 06:33.226
Talking about a nigga who
ain't even your nigga.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.454
I'm just saying, he's everybody's nigga.

06:36.454 --> 06:39.272
I mean everybody's fucking nigga.

06:39.272 --> 06:42.035
Okay?
(laughter)

06:42.035 --> 06:44.287
But on some real shit,

06:44.287 --> 06:45.796

06:45.796 --> 06:50.347

06:50.347 --> 06:51.694
- What's up, Murda?

06:51.694 --> 06:52.971

06:52.971 --> 06:55.015

07:17.956 --> 07:19.837
- Fuck out of here, man.

07:19.837 --> 07:21.996
Always joking, man.

ass needs all the strength

07:23.761 --> 07:25.038

07:25.038 --> 07:26.965

They're loving it.

08:02.980 --> 08:04.980
- Hold on, let me check.

08:20.627 --> 08:23.343
Girl, my wallet is not in here.

08:23.343 --> 08:24.412
- Well, this guy called.

08:24.412 --> 08:25.874
He said he has it.

08:25.874 --> 08:28.080
You must've dropped it when
you was at the store yesterday.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.874
He just left his number.

08:29.874 --> 08:31.198
- Girl, I bet his ghetto
ass took all my money

08:31.198 --> 08:32.365

08:36.190 --> 08:37.885

08:37.885 --> 08:39.673
We ain't worried about them niggas man.

08:39.673 --> 08:41.414
Niggas know exactly what
time it is, my nigga.

08:41.414 --> 08:42.878
- If you say so.

focus on getting this money.

08:59.991 --> 09:02.777

09:02.777 --> 09:04.960
We can let this play

What's good?

09:08.420 --> 09:09.920

10:12.341 --> 10:13.424
- Excuse you.

10:14.268 --> 10:15.870
Hello.

10:15.870 --> 10:18.287
(horn honks)

10:28.386 --> 10:29.686
Excuse you.

10:29.686 --> 10:31.521
I know you heard me.

10:31.521 --> 10:33.100
- Hey, man, don't be pulling
up to my place of business

10:33.100 --> 10:34.237
like that.

10:34.237 --> 10:36.977
- Look, I'm just trying to get my wallet.

10:36.977 --> 10:38.185
- What's my reward?

10:38.185 --> 10:40.135
- I'm gracing you with my presence.

10:40.135 --> 10:41.135
Now come on.

10:43.177 --> 10:46.614
- You might've won with that one.

10:46.614 --> 10:49.307
- Why you in such a rush?

10:49.307 --> 10:51.815
- Boy ain't nobody got time for that.

10:51.815 --> 10:53.324
- [Murda] You're saying I
can't take you out or nothing?

10:53.324 --> 10:54.648
- [Carmen] Where we gonna go?

10:54.648 --> 10:55.693
- Do it matter?

10:55.693 --> 10:56.645
- And what we gonna do there?

10:56.645 --> 11:00.938
- I'm gonna be listening
to you express yourself

11:00.938 --> 11:02.355
with no judgment.

11:03.725 --> 11:05.257
(chuckling)

11:05.257 --> 11:07.440
Just a little conversation over a dish.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.773
- And what could you possibly do for me.

11:13.793 --> 11:17.369
- It ain't about what I can do for you.

11:17.369 --> 11:20.388
It's only about how I can make you feel.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.059
- Uh, nigga don't be kissing my hand.

11:22.059 --> 11:24.892
I don't know where your lips been.

11:25.844 --> 11:27.634
- I'm saying though.

11:27.634 --> 11:29.909
You don't touched my nose.

11:29.909 --> 11:31.604
From the smell of your fingertips,

11:31.604 --> 11:33.253
I know where your hands been.

11:33.253 --> 11:34.948
(laughing)

11:34.948 --> 11:36.573
- You've got jokes?

11:36.573 --> 11:38.733
You know what, go ahead
and pull out your phone.

11:38.733 --> 11:39.754
- [Murda] Oh yeah.

11:39.754 --> 11:40.730
- M hm.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.541
- [Murda] You're gonna give me the number?

11:42.541 --> 11:44.329
- Yeah go to your camera first.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.465
Hold on, let me get myself together.

11:46.465 --> 11:47.556
- [Murda] Together for what?

11:47.556 --> 11:48.648
- So you can take a picture of me.

11:48.648 --> 11:51.065
I know you got a million hos.

11:52.293 --> 11:53.965
- [Murda] There you go.

11:53.965 --> 11:55.010
- Alright, you ready?

11:55.010 --> 11:56.241
- [Murda] Yeah I'm ready.

11:56.241 --> 12:00.063
- Okay, I want you to take a picture of me

12:00.063 --> 12:02.063
pulling off on your ass.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.467
- Renzo, why are you
always playing with me?

12:09.467 --> 12:10.790
- What are you talking about man?

12:10.790 --> 12:12.509
- I just call it how I see it.

12:12.509 --> 12:14.024
You ain't hit this in about a week, what?

12:14.024 --> 12:16.067
She don't get wet enough for you?

12:16.067 --> 12:17.112
- Man, stop playing.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.504
Man you know that
motherfucker get wet as Shamu.

12:19.504 --> 12:22.545
But look, we do got a
little free time tonight.

12:22.545 --> 12:24.844
So I'm gonna hit that
motherfucker for sure, for sure.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.354
You'd better not be playing,

12:26.354 --> 12:30.271
because I'm gonna have
to pay for a babysitter.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.202
Here go a little money
for a babysitter, man.

12:34.202 --> 12:36.222
And go get you something nice
to wear for a nigga, man.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.360
- This don't mean you're coming.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.403
You've still gotta come.

12:39.403 --> 12:41.098
I'm coming for sure, for sure.

12:41.098 --> 12:42.631
- Alright, I'll be back.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.488
- What the fuck is going on?

12:44.488 --> 12:46.044
You must be one of those bitches

12:46.044 --> 12:49.388
that keep calling and playing on my phone.

12:49.388 --> 12:50.386
- Man, what's up?

12:50.386 --> 12:52.337
- What you mean, what's up Renzo?

12:52.337 --> 12:54.264
Who the fuck is this bitch?

12:54.264 --> 12:55.471
- Hey, you don't have to disrespect me.

12:55.471 --> 12:56.818
I'm only his friend.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.258
- You really wanna try me right now?

12:58.258 --> 12:59.628
- I'm just saying.

12:59.628 --> 13:01.346
- Bitch, shut the fuck up
before wire it shut for you.

13:01.346 --> 13:03.204
- Man chill, that shit
ain't even that serious.

13:03.204 --> 13:04.458
- Yes the fuck it is, Renzo.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.617
Because you keep playing
with these rat ass hoes

13:06.617 --> 13:09.032
when you've got a real
one right in front of you.

13:09.032 --> 13:12.236
Nigga, don't you see that
this shit is hurting me?

13:12.236 --> 13:13.819
Can't you see that?

13:14.985 --> 13:17.772
Nigga, we just talked about
this shit this morning.

13:17.772 --> 13:18.770
- You heard what the bitch said.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.280
That's just my homie.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.441
- You lying ass nigga.

13:21.441 --> 13:23.298
Why don't you just tell
the fucking truth, Renzo?

13:23.298 --> 13:25.133
- That's just my friend.

13:25.133 --> 13:28.383
- You know what, I don't
even know why we keep

13:28.383 --> 13:30.148
talking about this shit

13:30.148 --> 13:32.565
because you ain't gonna stop.

13:34.931 --> 13:37.787
So you ain't got nothing to say, huh?

13:37.787 --> 13:41.370
You just gonna stand
there and look stupid.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.106
You know what, let me
just get the hell on,

13:48.678 --> 13:52.044
because the only one out
here looking stupid is me.

13:52.044 --> 13:54.627
(somber music)

14:25.845 --> 14:27.587
- I bumps into Bill at the park,

14:27.587 --> 14:29.254
and guess who I see?

14:30.095 --> 14:32.808
Mama Dee used to always say,
if you ever wanted something,

14:32.808 --> 14:34.573
you had to be persistent.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.315
What's up Carmen?

14:36.315 --> 14:38.103
- I'm not in the mood.

14:38.103 --> 14:38.936
- Damn.

14:39.774 --> 14:42.189
I mean I only came over here
because I seen you over here.

14:42.189 --> 14:43.768
And I know you forgot something.

14:43.768 --> 14:45.440
- The only thing I
forgot was to remind you

14:45.440 --> 14:49.747
I wasn't interested before
I pulled off on your ass.

14:49.747 --> 14:51.976
Yeah, you most definitely forgot that.

14:51.976 --> 14:55.714
But you also forgot that five I owe you.

14:55.714 --> 14:56.968
- You just walked all the way down here

14:56.968 --> 14:59.244
to bring me that five dollars?

14:59.244 --> 15:01.589
- Yeah, I don't like to owe people.

15:01.589 --> 15:03.756
- Well, give it here then.

15:04.886 --> 15:07.463
- Damn, you know what?

15:07.463 --> 15:09.623
I ain't even gonna be able
to give it to you right now.

15:09.623 --> 15:10.645
- What?

15:10.645 --> 15:12.827
- I mean, I made a bet
with some real mean niggas.

15:12.827 --> 15:14.290
- Oh God.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.194
- And the way Bron looking in the third,

15:16.194 --> 15:18.075
I'm gonna need that little
five to pay this debt off.

15:18.075 --> 15:19.515
- First of all, no.

15:19.515 --> 15:21.001
I want my money.

15:21.001 --> 15:22.401
And secondly, you're crazy as hell

15:22.401 --> 15:24.960
for betting against Kobe anyway.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.957
- I'm saying damn, you gonna
let niggas break my legs?

15:26.957 --> 15:29.302
- I ain't got nothing to do with that.

15:29.302 --> 15:30.951
- Talking about Kobe weak ass.

15:30.951 --> 15:32.530
Man, that nigga ain't
fucking with no Lebron.

15:32.530 --> 15:33.575
- What you mean?

15:33.575 --> 15:34.736
That nigga got five rings

15:34.736 --> 15:36.570
and seven championship appearances.

15:36.570 --> 15:38.939
I ain't even about to compare
that to your boy Lebron.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.076
- Yeah, yeah.

15:40.076 --> 15:41.934
Just like a Kobe fan.

15:41.934 --> 15:43.861
Always living in the past.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.881
Man, that nigga ain't fucking
with Lebron right now.

15:45.881 --> 15:47.971
- I see you like your players soft.

15:47.971 --> 15:49.318
(laughing)

15:49.318 --> 15:51.756
Man, Lebron is not
ready for the big shots.

15:51.756 --> 15:54.008
He can't hold no whole game
on his shoulders, win or lose.

15:54.008 --> 15:57.352
Man, that's completely opposite of mamba.

15:57.352 --> 16:00.533
Kobe more clutch than Lebron any day.

16:00.533 --> 16:01.711
- I guess 'cause you said like that,

16:01.711 --> 16:03.244
you think you got a point huh?

16:03.244 --> 16:05.124
- That is my point.

16:05.124 --> 16:07.028
Man, I wouldn't bet against
Kobe on the worst day,

16:07.028 --> 16:08.004
with the worst team,

16:08.004 --> 16:10.860
and if I was you, I'd change my bet.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.741
But not with my money.

16:12.741 --> 16:13.925
- Goddamn, man here.

16:13.925 --> 16:15.179
Take your little janky ass five,

16:15.179 --> 16:17.524
before a nigga be done lost everything.

16:17.524 --> 16:18.524
- Thank you.

16:20.450 --> 16:22.168
And you have a better day.

16:22.168 --> 16:23.501
- Yeah, alright.

16:29.877 --> 16:31.127
Hey yo, Carmen.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.326
- What?

16:35.211 --> 16:38.253
- Put your money where your mouth is.

16:38.253 --> 16:39.920
Friendly little bet.

16:40.947 --> 16:43.364
I win, I win a friendly date.

16:45.102 --> 16:48.376
You win, you win a friendly 50.

16:48.376 --> 16:50.071
- Man, I am not about to play with you.

16:50.071 --> 16:52.184
Especially about no 50 dollars.

16:52.184 --> 16:54.767
- Well bet 100 then, big money.

16:57.432 --> 16:59.522
- You really wanna do this.

16:59.522 --> 17:00.355
- Yeah.

17:01.426 --> 17:02.889
(chuckling)

17:02.889 --> 17:04.096
- Alright.

17:04.096 --> 17:04.929
Bet 1000.

17:06.974 --> 17:09.762
And when King James chokes,

17:09.762 --> 17:11.875
which we both know he will,

17:11.875 --> 17:15.875
I'll give you 1000 on top
of your friendly date.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.143
And if he so happens to win,

17:19.143 --> 17:21.163
which we know that shit
ain't gonna happen,

17:21.163 --> 17:23.578
I'll be sure to give you your money.

17:23.578 --> 17:25.994
So we got a deal, King James?

17:28.315 --> 17:29.398
What's wrong?

17:30.822 --> 17:32.239
Yeah, you're looking a
little nervous now that

17:32.239 --> 17:35.304
that big money talking, huh?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.836
- It's a bet.

17:36.836 --> 17:38.415
- Alright.

17:38.415 --> 17:41.248
I'll definitely have a better day.

17:54.042 --> 17:57.432
I'm sure you're probably
gonna change the subject,

17:57.432 --> 18:00.265
but we need to talk before we eat.

18:03.005 --> 18:05.954
- You still mad at me about earlier?

18:05.954 --> 18:07.121
- No, I'm not.

18:09.367 --> 18:13.222
- [Renzo] How'd everything
go at the shop today?

18:13.222 --> 18:15.055
- It went fine, Renzo.

18:16.101 --> 18:17.402
Just trying to figure out when

18:17.402 --> 18:18.795
I'm gonna do these
renovations so I can get it

18:18.795 --> 18:20.462
how I envisioned it.

18:22.510 --> 18:24.507
- When do you plan on doing that?

18:24.507 --> 18:26.272
- I don't know.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.897
I'm trying to wait for the right time.

18:27.897 --> 18:29.801
I don't wanna be shutting it down

18:29.801 --> 18:32.773
and it's the wrong timing of everything.

18:32.773 --> 18:34.023
- That's smart.

18:36.094 --> 18:39.011
How'd you like those wings earlier?

18:40.204 --> 18:41.621
- They were okay.

18:44.372 --> 18:47.669
- You want me to get
my shit together right?

18:47.669 --> 18:51.013
- It's like, I'm not even mad at you.

18:51.013 --> 18:52.846
I'm just disappointed.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.966
It's so crazy, because we've
been together for years

18:59.117 --> 19:03.284
and it's like we keep
arguing about the same shit.

19:04.945 --> 19:06.756
It's like more and more I except it,

19:06.756 --> 19:08.256
the worse it gets.

19:14.456 --> 19:16.987
- I know I be tripping, man.

19:16.987 --> 19:18.904
- You just be tripping.

19:19.982 --> 19:21.482
No, that's not it.

19:24.719 --> 19:27.366
Baby, if you talk to me, we
can get to the bottom of it

19:27.366 --> 19:28.736
together.

19:28.736 --> 19:30.486
So we can work on it.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.154
I mean, that's what I'm here for.

19:35.154 --> 19:36.315
To help you pick up the pieces

19:36.315 --> 19:38.982
if you fail at anything in life.

19:43.699 --> 19:45.699
Even if it's failing me.

19:51.501 --> 19:52.334
Baby.

19:59.071 --> 20:01.821
Listen, I'll do whatever it takes

20:03.970 --> 20:07.012
just to stop you from doing this to me.

20:07.012 --> 20:09.929
Alright, I'll open up another salon

20:10.797 --> 20:14.628
so that you think that
I'm grinding harder.

20:14.628 --> 20:17.391
I'll wear tighter clothes,

20:17.391 --> 20:20.308
so that you can find me sexy again.

20:21.919 --> 20:25.634
For God sake, baby, if you
want me to suck your dick

20:25.634 --> 20:29.217
for an hour, I'll suck
it for two straight.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.203
Look, all I'm trying to say is,

20:37.219 --> 20:41.386
I'll do any and everything just
to stop you from hurting me.

20:43.837 --> 20:47.170
If I have to hurt myself, then so be it.

20:52.219 --> 20:54.886
Lord knows that I'll hurt myself

20:57.258 --> 21:01.425
and I will hurt myself bad
if I have to leave you.

21:08.659 --> 21:10.909
So you have a better night.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.346
- Damn, getting it done in the rain, huh?

21:30.346 --> 21:32.047
Youngin ain't miss a shot yet?

21:32.047 --> 21:33.504
- You that nigga the young me.

21:33.504 --> 21:34.337
- What's up bro.

21:34.337 --> 21:36.425
- Get the fuck outta here, man.

21:36.425 --> 21:39.839
You know I heard what
happened the other day, right?

21:39.839 --> 21:42.602
- You know what the fuck get
on my nerves about you, man?

21:42.602 --> 21:45.667
Every time you call me,
you say you want one thing.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.292
Then when you get here,
you want another thing

21:47.292 --> 21:49.243
and it's smaller than
what you said you wanted.

21:49.243 --> 21:52.656
And you don't never have no fucking money.

21:52.656 --> 21:54.699
- But I love you, youngblood.

21:54.699 --> 21:55.721
I love you.

21:55.721 --> 21:59.888
- I love you too man, but I'm
running a fucking business.

22:01.712 --> 22:03.295
- What's your side?

22:08.794 --> 22:10.350
- Hey man, what the fuck
you mean what's my side?

22:10.350 --> 22:12.579
Ya'll niggas closing
all in on me and shit.

22:12.579 --> 22:13.577
- No disrespect.

22:13.577 --> 22:14.576
No disrespect.

22:14.576 --> 22:16.108
My cousin said you put your hands on him.

22:16.108 --> 22:19.525
I'm trying to get your side of the story.

22:38.102 --> 22:39.124
- Hey, B.

22:39.124 --> 22:40.958
Come the fuck here, my nigga.

22:40.958 --> 22:42.403
- What you look like that for, man.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.236
What's up.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.080
- Anybody been here?

22:46.080 --> 22:46.913
- No.

22:49.981 --> 22:51.235
- So you're telling me my
shit just got the fuck up

22:51.235 --> 22:52.814
and left, huh?

22:52.814 --> 22:55.601
- I'm the one that's
been here all day, man.

22:55.601 --> 22:56.518
- You sure?

22:57.969 --> 22:59.969
- Oh, Duke came through.

23:01.121 --> 23:02.468
He used the bathroom.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.277
He was in and out though.

23:05.277 --> 23:06.903
- Duke, huh?

23:06.903 --> 23:07.736
- Duke.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.322
- Yeah, alright.

23:19.232 --> 23:22.732
First off, the little nigga stole from me.

23:24.921 --> 23:26.504
So I chastised him.

23:28.285 --> 23:32.232
- Oh so you're playing daddy
around this motherfucker, huh?

23:32.232 --> 23:34.065
- More like big homie.

23:37.620 --> 23:40.197
- You gonna be here right?

23:40.197 --> 23:42.008
- I'm right here, ain't I?

23:42.008 --> 23:43.750
- [Man In Hoodie] Alright, come on fellas.

23:43.750 --> 23:46.420
Let's leave big homie alone.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.486
- Come on, man.

23:48.486 --> 23:51.829
You know that petty shit
gonna fuck up the money.

23:51.829 --> 23:53.996
You gotta think, my nigga.

23:54.929 --> 23:57.929
- Them niggas whipped up on me wild.

24:01.715 --> 24:03.965
(gunshots)

24:21.383 --> 24:24.006
Busting and everything.

24:24.006 --> 24:26.089
Fuck you wanted me to do.

24:27.977 --> 24:30.903
- Man, cut the bullshit my nigga.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.387
You know that shit can
get out of hand, man.

24:33.387 --> 24:35.470
Bodies get to dropping.

24:35.470 --> 24:37.258
The hood gets hot.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.907
Then what?

24:38.907 --> 24:41.415
The money slows up, my nigga.

24:41.415 --> 24:44.248
Let's avoid all that bullshit dog.

24:46.244 --> 24:48.994
- The fuck you want me to do bro.

24:50.285 --> 24:53.071
You want me to say fuck
everything we built?

24:53.071 --> 24:55.649
Fuck everything we stand for?

24:55.649 --> 24:57.732
Over a couple of dollars?

24:59.317 --> 25:00.362
We can make that money in

25:00.362 --> 25:03.125
a million different fucking ways man.

25:03.125 --> 25:06.330
It's only one way to
earn their respect, bro.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.913
And we earned that.

25:10.811 --> 25:14.317
I ain't about to let niggas fuck over us.

25:14.317 --> 25:16.500
- Are you finished man?

25:16.500 --> 25:19.542
Hey what's up with little
bro on this court man?

25:19.542 --> 25:21.841
Hey little nigga, you don't
want me to come out there.

25:21.841 --> 25:23.884
You do not want me to come out there, man.

25:23.884 --> 25:25.417
The J still wet, boy.

25:25.417 --> 25:26.670
- Come on.

25:26.670 --> 25:27.762
- I should do that little nigga

25:27.762 --> 25:29.364
like I used to do your
ass back in the day, boy.

25:29.364 --> 25:30.711
- Garbage.

25:30.711 --> 25:33.126
- Get the fuck outta here, man.

25:33.126 --> 25:34.124
- How you look, man?

25:34.124 --> 25:37.466
You gonna get that shit tested
out from the other night?

25:37.466 --> 25:39.216
- Still on the floor.

25:40.090 --> 25:42.923
- What the fuck you talking about?

25:44.037 --> 25:45.287
- Quads, nigga.

25:46.197 --> 25:50.005
This nigga G-Lo really starting
to get on my nerves now.

25:50.005 --> 25:51.653
He's always talking about shit being hot

25:51.653 --> 25:52.486
and money.

25:54.277 --> 25:56.321
What about respect?

25:56.321 --> 25:58.317
Niggas are shooting at me.

25:58.317 --> 26:00.570
This nigga Pooh won't pay his debt.

26:00.570 --> 26:02.845
G's just gonna have to be mad.

26:02.845 --> 26:04.595
Ain't no more passes.

26:07.002 --> 26:08.654
- Who's that G?

26:08.654 --> 26:09.487
- That's my dog, Murda.

26:09.487 --> 26:11.945
The one I was telling you about.

26:11.945 --> 26:12.778
- Oh yeah.

26:14.541 --> 26:16.491
- Nah, he's a good loyal dude man.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.884
You ain't gotta look like that, man.

26:17.884 --> 26:21.251
He'll grind a motherfucker too.

26:21.251 --> 26:24.084
- I don't know, I know a
wild nigga when I see them g.

26:24.084 --> 26:26.244
- Man, he'll bust that bitch.

26:26.244 --> 26:29.239
He's a little too quick
to bust that bitch though.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.770
- You know, dog ain't missed
a shot out there yet, huh G?

26:31.770 --> 26:33.906
- That's my little brother.

26:33.906 --> 26:35.903
He's about to go D-1.

26:35.903 --> 26:38.295
He's got a damn good
shot at the leagues too.

26:38.295 --> 26:40.594
- Bet you ain't fucking with
my young eastside hitter though

26:40.594 --> 26:42.344
putting up 20 a game.

26:43.403 --> 26:45.261
- Man, 20 points a game huh?

26:45.261 --> 26:46.840
That's decent I guess.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.340
He's averaging 16.

26:49.642 --> 26:50.942
Assists.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.196
And 22 points a game, boy.

26:52.196 --> 26:54.704
- Oh he's that nice huh?

26:54.704 --> 26:56.121
- He's that nice.

26:56.979 --> 26:58.628
- [Renzo] Well I bet I
got anything on my little

26:58.628 --> 26:59.603
eastside hitter.

26:59.603 --> 27:00.973
- Well put your money where your mouth is.

27:00.973 --> 27:02.784
Don't talk me to death.

27:02.784 --> 27:03.736
- Come on, man.

27:03.736 --> 27:06.069
Let's get up outta here man.

27:09.007 --> 27:10.354
- [Male Voice] You get
to see the backboard.

27:10.354 --> 27:12.629
I like to see the
backboard as I'm shooting.

27:12.629 --> 27:14.546
I'm just telling y'all.

27:20.077 --> 27:21.331
- Hey.

27:21.331 --> 27:22.817
What's up.

27:22.817 --> 27:24.814
(laughing)

27:24.814 --> 27:27.623
- What happened to your man last night?

27:27.623 --> 27:29.202
- Shut up, man.

27:29.202 --> 27:31.013
It wasn't Kobe's fault.

27:31.013 --> 27:32.569
I was looking at the stats and scoreboard.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.868
The team didn't even step up, as usual.

27:34.868 --> 27:36.934
(laughing)

27:36.934 --> 27:38.231
- You know what?

27:38.231 --> 27:39.438
I ain't even gonna rub it in.

27:39.438 --> 27:43.293
Lebron was just going
here and there, and there.

27:43.293 --> 27:44.454
- [Carmen] Whatever.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.335
- Man just give me my
money in all hundreds.

27:46.335 --> 27:49.835
- Oh, I've got your money in all hundreds.

27:51.281 --> 27:53.531
(giggling)

27:54.601 --> 27:56.226
- I said all hundreds, man.

27:56.226 --> 27:57.550
- These are all hundreds.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.883
100, 200, 300, there you go.

28:03.007 --> 28:03.840
- Yeah.

28:05.143 --> 28:06.583
What you about to do?

28:06.583 --> 28:07.999
- I gotta get back to the salon,

28:07.999 --> 28:09.717
so I can get back to work.

28:09.717 --> 28:11.227
I'll see you later.

28:11.227 --> 28:13.270
- What is you in such a rush for?

28:13.270 --> 28:15.290
I mean at least let me
treat you to lunch, dang.

28:15.290 --> 28:18.982
- Look, thank you for
your good sportsmanship,

28:18.982 --> 28:20.982
but I really have to go.

28:22.906 --> 28:27.318
And technically, if I
stay, this would be a date.

28:27.318 --> 28:28.316
(chuckles)

28:28.316 --> 28:29.965
- No it wouldn't.

28:29.965 --> 28:33.123
A date is between to people
that like each other.

28:33.123 --> 28:37.512
This right here, is two
competitors having a meeting

28:37.512 --> 28:38.360
over you know,

28:38.360 --> 28:42.202
seeing when the next time
they're going to compete.

28:42.202 --> 28:44.989
- Well, since you put it that way,

28:44.989 --> 28:46.939
I'll have an Italian sandwich.

28:46.939 --> 28:49.052
- So what's up with you man?

28:49.052 --> 28:52.233
I see you do hair and do
exotic dance on the side.

28:52.233 --> 28:53.232
- What you mean?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.391
Like I'm a stripper?

28:55.391 --> 28:59.339
- Yeah, I think that's like
the dumbed down version

28:59.339 --> 29:00.825
of exotic dancer.

29:00.825 --> 29:03.402
- And what the hell would
make you think that?

29:03.402 --> 29:06.653
- I mean my only clue is
this crispy thousand singles

29:06.653 --> 29:07.860
you gave me.

29:07.860 --> 29:08.905
(laughing)

29:08.905 --> 29:10.624
- You are something else.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.783
And yes, I'm a dancer and a stripper

29:12.783 --> 29:15.950
behind closed doors, not for a living.

29:17.474 --> 29:18.820
- So you just do hair.

29:18.820 --> 29:20.608
- Wrong again.

29:20.608 --> 29:22.191
I own my own salon.

29:24.881 --> 29:26.135
- [Murda] I mean damn, you didn't have to

29:26.135 --> 29:28.132
flex on me like that.

29:28.132 --> 29:29.115
- So what do you do?

29:29.115 --> 29:31.481
- Ah you know, I do a little
bit of this, a little that.

29:31.481 --> 29:32.448
You know dibble and dabble.

29:32.448 --> 29:35.056
- I know what that means.

29:35.056 --> 29:37.657
So you're a dealer huh?

29:37.657 --> 29:39.352
And that's okay.

29:39.352 --> 29:41.465
As long as you're using
it as a stepping stone,

29:41.465 --> 29:42.632
not permanent.

29:44.135 --> 29:48.302
- You know, I appreciate
you being so understanding.

29:49.731 --> 29:51.472
How long you've had the salon open?

29:51.472 --> 29:53.725
- Oh it's been about two years now.

29:53.725 --> 29:57.347
I mean, I love it but I'm
still trying to get it exactly

29:57.347 --> 29:58.680
where I want it.

29:59.762 --> 30:00.853
- [Murda] What's wrong?

30:00.853 --> 30:02.107
- I mean, it's nothing wrong for real.

30:02.107 --> 30:05.489
It's just, I don't know,
things are always great

30:05.489 --> 30:08.879
once upon a time, kinda
like relationships.

30:08.879 --> 30:11.759
And then time passes, shit happens.

30:11.759 --> 30:13.082
And you kinda get tired of looking

30:13.082 --> 30:14.708
at the old layout.

30:14.708 --> 30:18.330
And you just kinda want something new.

30:18.330 --> 30:19.654
- [Murda] I feel that.

30:19.654 --> 30:22.161
- So what do you do
when you're looking for

30:22.161 --> 30:26.328
a new layout but you still
love things about the old one?

30:28.105 --> 30:31.007
- Well you know, I'm not in
the business of construction

30:31.007 --> 30:31.924
or nothing.

30:33.167 --> 30:34.305
I mean, but I could only guess,

30:34.305 --> 30:37.277
if you wanted a new layout,

30:37.277 --> 30:40.040
and you were stuck in the old one,

30:40.040 --> 30:41.387
the only thing that got you stuck is

30:41.387 --> 30:43.887
the time you've spent with it.

30:45.079 --> 30:48.422
Because if it ain't bringing
no color into your life,

30:48.422 --> 30:51.209
maybe it's time for some new paint.

30:51.209 --> 30:52.042
- Wow.

30:52.881 --> 30:53.881
Look at you.

30:54.947 --> 30:56.573
I guess you dibble and dabble in a lot.

30:56.573 --> 30:57.873
(laughing)

30:57.873 --> 31:01.472
Construction, dealing and counseling.

31:01.472 --> 31:04.073
It was so nice talking to you.

31:04.073 --> 31:06.766
But save that Italian
sandwich for me later,

31:06.766 --> 31:08.599
I've got to get going.

31:12.478 --> 31:13.477
- Hey.

31:13.477 --> 31:17.378
Don't make the wrong
decision at the salon, okay?

31:17.378 --> 31:20.025
Color with some ugly color scheme.

31:20.025 --> 31:21.232
- I won't.

31:21.232 --> 31:22.065
Thank you.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.529
- You're welcome.

31:24.529 --> 31:26.132
Have a better day.

31:26.132 --> 31:28.799
- [Carmen] Don't say what I say.

31:36.790 --> 31:38.587
- You know what I was thinking?

31:38.587 --> 31:41.281
Maybe I should dye my hair green

31:41.281 --> 31:45.042
and maybe I'll really find
me a man with some money.

31:45.042 --> 31:46.598
Speaking of, you didn't
even tell me what happened

31:46.598 --> 31:49.348
with you and Renzo the other day.

31:50.888 --> 31:51.721
Carmen.

31:53.836 --> 31:55.462
Carmen.

31:55.462 --> 31:56.971
Carmen.

31:56.971 --> 31:57.971
You alright.

31:58.806 --> 31:59.889
- Girl, yeah.

32:01.632 --> 32:04.372
- What happened with you
and Renzo the other day?

32:04.372 --> 32:07.484
- I caught him around the
corner hugged up on some chick.

32:07.484 --> 32:08.317
- Where?

32:10.224 --> 32:11.974
- At the barber shop.

32:13.056 --> 32:15.889
Girl, on top of that, he's
got all these different chick

32:15.889 --> 32:17.050
calling my phone and playing all the time.

32:17.050 --> 32:19.133
I'm so sick of this shit.

32:21.787 --> 32:24.527
- You know what's crazy?

32:24.527 --> 32:27.685
Sometimes, you've just got to be logical.

32:27.685 --> 32:29.018
- What you mean?

32:30.146 --> 32:30.979
- Oh.

32:34.767 --> 32:37.879
You do realize that you
have a successful man?

32:37.879 --> 32:38.877
- [Carmen] Yes.

32:38.877 --> 32:40.340
- Do you want to keep him?

32:40.340 --> 32:41.501
- Of course I want to keep him.

32:41.501 --> 32:42.334
- Okay.

32:43.242 --> 32:45.564
You're gonna have to
learn how to tolerate him.

32:45.564 --> 32:50.348
Have a little time and
dealing with other women.

32:50.348 --> 32:52.252
- No, that's some nonsense.

32:52.252 --> 32:54.759
I can understand a nigga not
having enough time for me

32:54.759 --> 32:55.592
because he's gotta grind
and do whatever it is

32:55.592 --> 32:58.092
he gotta do to make ends meet.

32:59.821 --> 33:01.527
But I'm not about to keep
dealing with no nigga

33:01.527 --> 33:04.639
having all these different
women in my face all the time.

33:04.639 --> 33:08.284
- No, having women in your
face is mad disrespectful.

33:08.284 --> 33:12.614
But having women ain't
all that bad, Carmen.

33:12.614 --> 33:14.030
- That's crazy.

33:14.030 --> 33:16.724
- We can have our own money, cook, clean,

33:16.724 --> 33:19.626
head and sex game be top of the line.

33:19.626 --> 33:22.227
That's not gonna stop no man
from going down the street,

33:22.227 --> 33:24.200
messing with the next hoodrat

33:24.200 --> 33:26.360
that's gonna eventually played out.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.380
All you gotta do is be
cool how you be cool.

33:28.380 --> 33:29.425
Stop tripping.

33:29.425 --> 33:30.586
Do not nag no nigga.

33:30.586 --> 33:31.419
Don't nag.

33:32.931 --> 33:34.858
He'll come back, he'll
learn how to appreciate you.

33:34.858 --> 33:36.321
Just chill.

33:36.321 --> 33:39.699
- That's the craziest
shit I've heard all day.

33:39.699 --> 33:41.789
- I think you're crazy.

33:41.789 --> 33:42.927
I'm convinced.

33:42.927 --> 33:45.016
You've got it good, you
don't even realize it.

33:45.016 --> 33:47.524
You've got it too good.

33:47.524 --> 33:49.428
You remember my last relationship?

33:49.428 --> 33:50.914
- Terrance.

33:50.914 --> 33:51.913
(laughing)

33:51.913 --> 33:52.865
- Terrance broke ass.

33:52.865 --> 33:53.956
Never could find a job.

33:53.956 --> 33:55.512
Why, I don't know.

33:55.512 --> 33:58.507
Never cheated, because
I was the meal ticket.

33:58.507 --> 34:00.527
And you're complaining about a man

34:00.527 --> 34:02.037
that gives you everything.

34:02.037 --> 34:03.546
Everything.

34:03.546 --> 34:06.611
And all you gotta do is
share him every blue moon?

34:06.611 --> 34:08.585
- Uh, uh, right, I don't
wanna hear that shit.

34:08.585 --> 34:10.791
Because you told me besides all of that,

34:10.791 --> 34:13.902
and him not having much, that
he still gave you a house

34:13.902 --> 34:14.985
full of love.

34:16.270 --> 34:18.081
- You're right, I did say that.

34:18.081 --> 34:20.195
- [Carmen] Exactly.

34:20.195 --> 34:21.913
- You're right.

34:21.913 --> 34:23.770
But with the house full of
love came a house full of bills

34:23.770 --> 34:26.905
that he could not afford to pay.

34:26.905 --> 34:29.529
Look, I'd rather deal with a rich man

34:29.529 --> 34:31.409
that can buy me everything

34:31.409 --> 34:33.523
then be dealing with a poor
man that can only give me

34:33.523 --> 34:34.523
what he can.

34:35.728 --> 34:38.373
- You know what, money
can't buy everything.

34:38.373 --> 34:42.456
It can't by love, happiness
and time that I need.

34:43.597 --> 34:47.679
I mean that's something
that a poor man can give.

34:49.426 --> 34:51.446
- You're right.

34:51.446 --> 34:53.141
I'm tripping.

34:53.141 --> 34:54.224
I'm tripping.

34:55.277 --> 34:56.860
But answer me this.

34:58.435 --> 35:02.173
When was the last time you
were able to walk into the mall

35:02.173 --> 35:05.340
and pull out that pocket full of love,

35:06.748 --> 35:10.672
happiness and time and
be able to afford those

35:10.672 --> 35:12.878
red bottoms you like,
with that little poor man

35:12.878 --> 35:14.155
on your arm.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.943
My point exactly.

35:15.943 --> 35:16.965
- Whatever.

35:16.965 --> 35:19.403
- The thought of never
speaking to Carmen again

35:19.403 --> 35:22.770
made me think, why in
the hell am I giving her

35:22.770 --> 35:25.672
five dollars at the park.

35:25.672 --> 35:30.223
See she was so thrown off
by me having her wallet,

35:30.223 --> 35:34.306
she didn't even realize
she only had large bills.

35:36.075 --> 35:39.906
You know me being me,
seeing a woman walk around

35:39.906 --> 35:42.989
with that much money, I already knew.

35:44.759 --> 35:48.753
It would only take five
dollars to get her attention.

35:48.753 --> 35:52.003
Because only small things count, right?

35:56.740 --> 35:59.407
(phone ringing)

36:04.147 --> 36:04.980
Yo.

36:05.819 --> 36:07.352
- [Carmen] Double or nothing.

36:07.352 --> 36:08.443
- What?

36:08.443 --> 36:09.767
- [Carmen] Double or nothing.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.137
- Come on, man.

36:11.137 --> 36:12.832
I'm not about to keep taking your money.

36:12.832 --> 36:14.039
(laughter)

36:14.039 --> 36:15.456
What are you doing?

36:15.456 --> 36:17.661
- [Carmen] Bout to get
that chicken shwarma.

36:17.661 --> 36:19.031
- Bring me one.

36:19.031 --> 36:20.494
- [Carmen] You really want one?

36:20.494 --> 36:22.956
- Yeah with the grape Kool-Aid.

36:22.956 --> 36:24.744
- [Carmen] Alright, I've got you.

36:24.744 --> 36:25.742
Where you at?

36:25.742 --> 36:26.764
- I'm at the house.

36:26.764 --> 36:27.785
I'm gonna send you the address.

36:27.785 --> 36:29.411
- [Carmen] Alright give me
a second, I'll be there.

36:29.411 --> 36:30.479
- Alright.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.871
(knocking at the door)

36:32.871 --> 36:33.704
Who is it?

36:43.863 --> 36:45.946
- [Carmen] Hey what's up?

36:48.547 --> 36:50.800
- I see you spent that money wisely.

36:50.800 --> 36:54.662
- Whatever, you think
you're so slick, don't you?

36:54.662 --> 36:55.495
- Hey.

36:56.450 --> 36:57.283
- What?

36:57.283 --> 36:59.116
- [Murda] You know you're
disrespectful, right?

36:59.116 --> 37:00.326
- How, what did I do?

37:00.326 --> 37:01.975
- You don't go to a
restaurant a man took you to

37:01.975 --> 37:02.975
by yourself.

37:03.879 --> 37:07.826
- And how long have you been going there?

37:07.826 --> 37:10.357
- I've been eating good for forever.

37:10.357 --> 37:12.215
Yeah like way before it
was even called that.

37:12.215 --> 37:14.583
- Yeah like when it was called Toya's?

37:14.583 --> 37:16.998
Nigga, my auntie used to own that, fool.

37:16.998 --> 37:19.227
(laughing)

37:19.227 --> 37:21.967
Now, what you say about
me being disrespectful?

37:21.967 --> 37:25.079
- What I saying was, you
just walked in a nigga crib

37:25.079 --> 37:26.866
without him telling you to come in.

37:26.866 --> 37:29.351
- Whatever, shut up.

37:29.351 --> 37:31.129
And what you know about this record?

37:31.129 --> 37:34.914
- What you thought I just walk like this?

37:34.914 --> 37:37.027
- Boy whatever, you know
you called your grandma,

37:37.027 --> 37:38.606
asking her what should I have playing

37:38.606 --> 37:41.160
when I've got a beautiful,
classy lady coming through.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.901
(laughing)

37:42.901 --> 37:44.550
- I guess I did that when you said

37:44.550 --> 37:46.036
you were on your way, huh?

37:46.036 --> 37:49.036
- Yeah, that's exactly what you did.

37:51.585 --> 37:52.630
- [Murda] Yeah whatever.

37:52.630 --> 37:53.791
You want something to drink?

37:53.791 --> 37:55.788
- Yeah, I'll take a
water with three cubes.

37:55.788 --> 37:56.833
- You'll what?

37:56.833 --> 38:00.177
- My bad, it's just something I always do.

38:00.177 --> 38:01.709
Just a water is fine.

38:01.709 --> 38:03.010
- You might be a little slow.

38:03.010 --> 38:03.843
- Shut up.

38:11.035 --> 38:11.868
Oh my God.

38:15.679 --> 38:18.790
- [Murda] What you know about that?

38:18.790 --> 38:20.694
- What you know about it?

38:20.694 --> 38:22.645
- Ah man, I got a basement full of them.

38:22.645 --> 38:24.758
- You still ain't killing my collection.

38:24.758 --> 38:27.590
I've been collecting these
things since I was a little girl.

38:27.590 --> 38:28.423
- So you're trying to tell me

38:28.423 --> 38:30.109
you think you've got
more of those than I got?

38:30.109 --> 38:31.688
- No I'm trying to tell
you I know I've got more

38:31.688 --> 38:33.615
than what you've got.

38:33.615 --> 38:34.846
(laughing)

38:34.846 --> 38:35.844
- Alright, bet.

38:35.844 --> 38:37.284
I bet you ain't got this one I got.

38:37.284 --> 38:38.282
- I doubt it.

38:38.282 --> 38:39.745
- You know how I know you ain't got it?

38:39.745 --> 38:40.767
- How?

38:40.767 --> 38:42.857
- Every time I show
people, they freak out.

38:42.857 --> 38:44.389
- Man, let me see what
you're talking about.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.504
- Man, close your eyes.

38:45.504 --> 38:46.990
- Just show me.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.490
- Close your eyes.

38:49.846 --> 38:50.844
They closed?

38:50.844 --> 38:52.052
- Yes.

38:52.052 --> 38:53.635
- Keep them closed.

38:56.649 --> 38:57.787
Booyow.

38:57.787 --> 38:58.971
(laughing)

38:58.971 --> 39:00.272
- Oh my God.

39:00.272 --> 39:01.735
- Marvin Gaye original anthology record.

39:01.735 --> 39:04.498
- Boy, you stole this didn't you?

39:04.498 --> 39:05.888
(laughing)

39:05.888 --> 39:07.606
- I'm plugged.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.710
- Man, I used to always want this.

39:09.710 --> 39:11.985
I did not know they had a limited edition.

39:11.985 --> 39:14.563
You've gotta play this.

39:14.563 --> 39:16.396
- Damn, you know what?

39:18.115 --> 39:20.066
My record broke.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.389
- Are you serious?

39:21.389 --> 39:22.222
- Yeah.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.012
Don't worry about it.

39:25.012 --> 39:27.595
I've got it on my phone though.

39:37.225 --> 39:39.849
- Oh my God, I love this song.

39:39.849 --> 39:41.312
That's what I'm talking about.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.145
- Yeah?

39:44.284 --> 39:46.420
What do you end up doing
when you hear this?

39:46.420 --> 39:48.670
- Nothing but dance, nigga.

39:50.879 --> 39:52.462
You something else.

39:58.498 --> 40:02.665
("Let's Get It On" by Marvin Gaye)

40:49.792 --> 40:50.861
(sighing)

40:50.861 --> 40:52.022
Look, I'm sorry.

40:52.022 --> 40:53.066
I've got to go.

40:53.066 --> 40:55.412
I'll call you later.

40:55.412 --> 40:59.475
- How you gonna start
something and just quit?

40:59.475 --> 41:01.642
(sighing)

41:05.698 --> 41:08.531
I knew she ain't have that record.

41:10.365 --> 41:13.282
(players shouting)

41:22.261 --> 41:23.245
- [Coach] Get back on D, get back.

41:23.245 --> 41:26.523
(players all shouting)

41:26.523 --> 41:27.522
- Go.
- Get back.

41:27.522 --> 41:28.355
Get back on defense.

41:28.355 --> 41:29.188
- Strong.

41:31.031 --> 41:33.031
Man, what in the world.

41:34.026 --> 41:34.859
- You've got to pass it.

41:34.859 --> 41:35.783
- Get back on defense.

41:35.783 --> 41:36.735
- Pass the ball, son.

41:36.735 --> 41:38.254
Get back, get back.

41:38.254 --> 41:40.921
- Man, where was he going today?

41:41.876 --> 41:43.904
(all shouting)

41:43.904 --> 41:45.237
- Pass the ball.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.436
- What type of pass is that, son?

41:51.436 --> 41:52.969
- Get back on defense.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.339
What you walking for?

41:54.339 --> 41:55.430
- [Murda] When mom died,

41:55.430 --> 41:58.147
JR lost a lot of faith in basketball.

41:58.147 --> 42:00.237
So every day, I push him harder

42:00.237 --> 42:02.791
to get him to believe again.

42:02.791 --> 42:03.836
Hey what's up, unc.

42:03.836 --> 42:05.020
- Hey what's going on?

42:05.020 --> 42:05.853
- You doing alright?

42:05.853 --> 42:06.686
- Let me talk to you.

42:06.686 --> 42:08.019
Listen, our boy.

42:08.958 --> 42:10.607
He's not there today.

42:10.607 --> 42:13.997
He's missing routine shots
and not getting back on D.

42:13.997 --> 42:15.042
Man, I don't know.

42:15.042 --> 42:16.714
Look, maybe you could
talk to him, alright.

42:16.714 --> 42:17.967
Maybe you can get to him.

42:17.967 --> 42:18.800
- Alright.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.633
I'll talk to him.

42:19.633 --> 42:20.883
- Alright, now.

42:26.387 --> 42:28.245
- What's up, bro.

42:28.245 --> 42:30.218
- [JR] What's up.

42:30.218 --> 42:31.797
- How are you feeling?

42:31.797 --> 42:33.380
- [JR] I'm alright.

42:34.398 --> 42:36.186
- That ain't what coach said.

42:36.186 --> 42:39.309
He says you've been a fucking bum all day.

42:39.309 --> 42:41.404
- Man, fuck what coach talking about, man.

42:41.404 --> 42:44.771
He don't know what I go through.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.327
- Hey man, don't never in
your life let me hear you

42:46.327 --> 42:47.952
disrespect that man.

42:47.952 --> 42:49.485
That man fucking loves you.

42:49.485 --> 42:51.652
Now what's wrong with you?

42:54.732 --> 42:57.065
- I didn't get accepted man.

43:02.767 --> 43:04.415
- Hey don't even worry about that.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.655
We're gonna be alright, alright?

43:05.655 --> 43:07.387
- No we're not, man.

43:07.387 --> 43:10.243
You're always saying that.

43:10.243 --> 43:13.378
We struggle around here bro.

43:13.378 --> 43:17.545
Bills barely getting paid,
barely food on the table to eat.

43:18.951 --> 43:21.969
Things just haven't been the
same since momma been gone.

43:21.969 --> 43:22.802
- Hey man.

43:23.734 --> 43:25.383
Don't you think I know that?

43:25.383 --> 43:26.706
Don't you think I know?

43:26.706 --> 43:28.839
I don't want you to
worry about no clothes,

43:28.839 --> 43:32.089
no bills, no food or none of that, man.

43:32.972 --> 43:33.805
I got us.

43:35.410 --> 43:40.240
I'd rob and kill for you
and Bre to be alright, man.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.817
- If you've gotta rob and kill
just for me to go to college,

43:42.817 --> 43:44.234
I don't wanna go.

43:46.300 --> 43:48.800
- Bro, what is you saying man?

43:51.037 --> 43:54.451
This is what I mean when I
say put it all on the line.

43:54.451 --> 43:56.865
I put it all on the line
for you and Bre man.

43:56.865 --> 43:59.536
I want you to do the
same out on that court.

43:59.536 --> 44:00.534
Leave it all on the court.

44:00.534 --> 44:01.533
Man, as long as I'm a live,

44:01.533 --> 44:02.972
I'm gonna make sure
you get there, alright?

44:02.972 --> 44:06.641
And as long they're calling that 826-4826,

44:06.641 --> 44:08.313
we're gonna be good, man.

44:08.313 --> 44:09.358
We're on a come-up.

44:09.358 --> 44:11.308
You believe me?

44:11.308 --> 44:13.352
- You know I believe in your bro.

44:13.352 --> 44:15.047
- Alright, then bro.

44:15.047 --> 44:16.742
For real, man.

44:16.742 --> 44:17.972
Now listen.

44:17.972 --> 44:19.598
You've gotta show me
you still ain't garbage

44:19.598 --> 44:21.641
because coach was talking crazy about you.

44:21.641 --> 44:24.808
(hiphop instrumental)

44:44.085 --> 44:46.085
Yeah, he's still got it.

44:49.123 --> 44:50.888
You lock that door?

44:50.888 --> 44:52.471
- Yeah I locked it.

44:54.626 --> 44:56.531
Your crazy self.

44:56.531 --> 44:57.877
I got something to eat.

44:57.877 --> 44:59.456
- Set it over there.

44:59.456 --> 45:01.291
This nigga Bron is going the fuck off.

45:01.291 --> 45:03.752
- Why are you so excited about this?

45:03.752 --> 45:05.168
- Because it's game seven of the finals

45:05.168 --> 45:07.003
and this nigga Bron just brought me back.

45:07.003 --> 45:09.162
- That is so wack, you've
gotta pick this nigga

45:09.162 --> 45:10.079
even in 2K.

45:11.763 --> 45:14.363
- There you go with the hating.

45:14.363 --> 45:15.385
Which you get me?

45:15.385 --> 45:16.662
- Your favorite.

45:16.662 --> 45:17.662
- Whoa, man.

45:18.868 --> 45:19.843
Three days in a row?

45:19.843 --> 45:21.631
That shit ain't gonna
be my favorite no more.

45:21.631 --> 45:23.977
- Shut up, you'll eat it.

45:23.977 --> 45:25.555
(laughing)

45:25.555 --> 45:27.111
So who's the lead scorer?

45:27.111 --> 45:29.317
- I just told you man.

45:29.317 --> 45:30.362
- So what Curry doing?

45:30.362 --> 45:33.357
(laughter)

45:33.357 --> 45:34.681
My bad.

45:34.681 --> 45:35.726
That's my bad.

45:35.726 --> 45:36.887
- I don't know Curry doing, but I know

45:36.887 --> 45:38.543
what the fuck you doing.

45:38.543 --> 45:39.376
(laughing)

45:39.376 --> 45:40.209
Come on, man.

45:40.209 --> 45:41.406
Don't distract me.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.489
- Okay, okay.

45:45.088 --> 45:48.200
So you think Kyrie better than Curry?

45:48.200 --> 45:49.616
(laughing)

45:49.616 --> 45:50.615
Okay, my bad, I quit.

45:50.615 --> 45:51.613
I quit.

45:51.613 --> 45:52.921
- That's how you're gonna
do me in the finals?

45:52.921 --> 45:53.921
- I'm sorry.

45:55.624 --> 45:57.644
(mumbling)

45:57.644 --> 45:59.409
What you doing?

45:59.409 --> 46:00.407
- Pick a team.

46:00.407 --> 46:02.961
- Yo I am not about to play you in 2K.

46:02.961 --> 46:03.960
You don't want to see me.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.748
- Pick a team.

46:05.748 --> 46:06.746
(laughing)

46:06.746 --> 46:08.534
- Alright, come on.

46:08.534 --> 46:10.345
Don't say I didn't warn you.

46:10.345 --> 46:11.808
You already know who I got.

46:11.808 --> 46:13.039
- The garbage man.

46:13.039 --> 46:16.918
(video game announcer)

46:16.918 --> 46:17.917
- [Carmen] See you thought
I was just a girly girl

46:17.917 --> 46:19.528
and I ain't know how to play 2K huh?

46:19.528 --> 46:21.130
- You've got some game,
you've got some game.

46:21.130 --> 46:22.477
- I know I do.

46:22.477 --> 46:25.681
And I told you Kobe was way
better than Lebron weak ass.

46:25.681 --> 46:27.446
(laughter)

46:27.446 --> 46:28.886
- Nigga garbage, man.

46:28.886 --> 46:30.836
- He's garbage but I just
beat you three times in a row?

46:30.836 --> 46:31.669
Exactly.

46:32.903 --> 46:33.948
- I let you win.

46:33.948 --> 46:35.364
- Right.

46:35.364 --> 46:37.802
Man I wish I could stay longer.

46:37.802 --> 46:40.542
I really gotta get going though.

46:40.542 --> 46:42.542
I had a good time today.

46:45.395 --> 46:49.562
- Well, if you had such a
good time, why you gotta go?

46:55.426 --> 46:58.176
(soft R&B music)

48:48.467 --> 48:50.384
- Oh you're here early.

48:53.446 --> 48:54.932
- Hey girl.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.789
I couldn't really sleep.

48:56.789 --> 48:59.111
Just wanted to come in
and look at everything.

48:59.111 --> 49:02.223
I think I'm really ready to
start remodeling finally.

49:02.223 --> 49:04.638
- So you finally decided
to do it, huh girl?

49:04.638 --> 49:05.638
- Girl, yes.

49:06.681 --> 49:09.746
I'm tired of looking at this old layout.

49:09.746 --> 49:12.079
I'm ready for something new.

49:15.714 --> 49:19.173
- Speaking of, you're looking real new.

49:19.173 --> 49:20.006
Glowing.

49:21.402 --> 49:24.839
- Girl, what are you talking about?

49:24.839 --> 49:26.922
- Carmen, you're glowing.

49:28.856 --> 49:30.627
I'm your best friend and
there's only two things

49:30.627 --> 49:31.997
that make you glow like that.

49:31.997 --> 49:32.996
I know.

49:32.996 --> 49:35.155
Number one, Kobe Bryant.

49:35.155 --> 49:37.175
And we both know he is taken.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.126
Number two, a new car and I would've been

49:39.126 --> 49:41.796
the first person call about that.

49:41.796 --> 49:43.713
So I mean you know, me.

49:44.765 --> 49:46.098
A brand new man.

49:48.086 --> 49:50.215
We already know Lorenzo ain't
playing them games with you.

49:50.215 --> 49:51.132
Girl, so...

49:55.045 --> 49:56.183
What was that?

49:56.183 --> 49:57.016
- What?

49:57.971 --> 50:00.221
(giggling)

50:03.033 --> 50:04.240
- Bitch, what was that?

50:04.240 --> 50:07.027
(laughing)

50:07.027 --> 50:09.325
You're seeing somebody
and you didn't tell me.

50:09.325 --> 50:11.287
I know that look.

50:11.287 --> 50:12.378
- Maybe.

50:12.378 --> 50:13.211
- What you mean maybe?

50:13.211 --> 50:14.381
It's either yes or no.

50:14.381 --> 50:15.380
Not no maybe.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.121
You're either seeing
somebody or you're not.

50:17.121 --> 50:18.120
- Yes, girl.

50:18.120 --> 50:19.559
No.

50:19.559 --> 50:20.948
I don't know.

50:20.948 --> 50:22.922
I don't really know what to call it?

50:22.922 --> 50:24.083
- You don't know what to call it.

50:24.083 --> 50:26.428
But you do know you're happy, that's all?

50:26.428 --> 50:27.566
- Yes I am.

50:27.566 --> 50:29.981
- So who is this Mr. Happy?

50:29.981 --> 50:31.026
Do I know him?

50:31.026 --> 50:33.208
- No, you don't know him.

50:33.208 --> 50:36.482
And I mean, he's not on
Lorenzo's level or nothing

50:36.482 --> 50:37.565
but it works.

50:38.549 --> 50:39.803
- So he broke?

50:39.803 --> 50:41.846
- No he's not broke.

50:41.846 --> 50:42.679
- Okay.

50:43.820 --> 50:46.003
- But he ain't rich either.

50:46.003 --> 50:47.674
- [Rachel] Carmen.

50:47.674 --> 50:48.766
- I know.

50:48.766 --> 50:49.599
- Carmen.

50:50.995 --> 50:51.993
- What?

50:51.993 --> 50:52.992
- Stop.

50:52.992 --> 50:53.909
He's broke?

50:55.941 --> 50:58.448
So let me get this straight?

50:58.448 --> 50:59.365
He's broke.

51:00.422 --> 51:02.140
What else are you telling me about him?

51:02.140 --> 51:05.740
- Really, it's nothing about all of that?

51:05.740 --> 51:07.481
I mean for me, it's just more so about

51:07.481 --> 51:10.035
how he makes me feel.

51:10.035 --> 51:12.334
He makes me feel like a woman.

51:12.334 --> 51:14.334
Appreciated, and wanted.

51:18.627 --> 51:19.834
- Carmen, how do you
expect to balance this

51:19.834 --> 51:22.458
and you are involved in a relationship.

51:22.458 --> 51:25.802
How in the hell do you even
think you're gonna do that.

51:25.802 --> 51:28.750
- I'm not thinking about balancing
anything right now, okay?

51:28.750 --> 51:31.444
It's just more so about enjoying myself

51:31.444 --> 51:33.527
and living in the moment.

51:37.826 --> 51:38.987
- But he broke.

51:38.987 --> 51:40.102
(Carmen sighs)

51:40.102 --> 51:41.611
Nuh-uh.

51:41.611 --> 51:43.260
Come here.

51:43.260 --> 51:45.593
(crosstalk)

51:51.480 --> 51:53.105
Hey, hey, hey.

51:53.105 --> 51:56.333
Real quick, we've gotta help Carmen.

51:56.333 --> 51:57.378
- What's up, boo.

51:57.378 --> 51:58.376
- Let me ask you this.

51:58.376 --> 52:03.252
Would you rather deal with
a rich nigga that ain't shit

52:03.252 --> 52:05.458
or be dealing with a poor nigga?

52:05.458 --> 52:06.503
Now, what?

52:06.503 --> 52:08.245
What did you say?

52:08.245 --> 52:09.412
Got good dick?

52:11.101 --> 52:13.005
- I'll take a rich nigga for 200, Alex.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.584
- Okay, ding.

52:14.584 --> 52:16.325
Because mama said don't
bring home no broke nigga.

52:16.325 --> 52:18.113
And can't no broke nigga
pay your bills, girl.

52:18.113 --> 52:19.111
Bye.

52:19.111 --> 52:20.319
- [Patron] What mama say?

52:20.319 --> 52:21.921
- Don't bring home no broke nigga.

52:21.921 --> 52:23.570
- There ain't nothing
wrong with sharing your man

52:23.570 --> 52:24.545
from time to time.

52:24.545 --> 52:26.379
As long as I'm taken care of, I'm good.

52:26.379 --> 52:27.401
- [Stylist] Okay?

52:27.401 --> 52:28.423
- What.

52:28.423 --> 52:29.955
I'm trying to go to
motherfucking Somerset.

52:29.955 --> 52:31.650
I'm trying to go to Beni-Ha-Ha's

52:31.650 --> 52:34.530
and eat up all the motherfucking wontons.

52:34.530 --> 52:37.595
(all cheering)

52:37.595 --> 52:38.639
- She dropped that shit good.

52:38.639 --> 52:40.799
- So let me get this straight.

52:40.799 --> 52:43.446
Okay, so you've got a boss

52:43.446 --> 52:44.979
that's giving you everything you want

52:44.979 --> 52:48.229
and on the other hand, you've got a man

52:48.229 --> 52:50.598
that ain't got nothing,

52:50.598 --> 52:54.243
sex is great and he's treating
you like a woman wants

52:54.243 --> 52:55.410
to be treated?

52:57.355 --> 52:59.236
I'll take both.

52:59.236 --> 53:00.188
- Both?

53:00.188 --> 53:03.810
I want my cake and I want to eat it too.

53:03.810 --> 53:05.459
- You done lost your damn mind.

53:05.459 --> 53:06.875
- [Stylist] Lord Jesus.

53:06.875 --> 53:08.036
- Sit down.

53:08.036 --> 53:08.869
Sit down.

53:14.677 --> 53:15.977
See shit like that will
have somebody like her

53:15.977 --> 53:17.463
end up killed.

53:17.463 --> 53:18.601
- Tell her.

53:18.601 --> 53:19.599
- Okay.

53:19.599 --> 53:20.830
- [Patron] Sister, do you wanna die?

53:20.830 --> 53:22.316
Bitch, you trying to be on
karma to motherfucking D.

53:22.316 --> 53:23.965
- She really wanna be on somebody t-shirt.

53:23.965 --> 53:28.039
(crosstalk)
(echoing laughter)

53:28.039 --> 53:30.622
(somber music)

53:50.142 --> 53:51.744
- [G-Lo] Come on, man.

53:51.744 --> 53:53.277
You wasting your fucking time man.

53:53.277 --> 53:54.944
Where little bro at?

53:56.853 --> 53:57.875
- You know that nigga, man.

53:57.875 --> 53:59.291
He went to check the score
on that Chancey game.

53:59.291 --> 54:00.777
- Yeah man.

54:00.777 --> 54:02.983
Hey look, you calmed
down from the other day?

54:02.983 --> 54:04.237
- Fuck them niggas man.

54:04.237 --> 54:05.537
- There you go man.

54:05.537 --> 54:06.954
- I'm still on they ass though.

54:06.954 --> 54:08.393
- Yeah, I hear you man.

54:08.393 --> 54:09.392
What's good, man?

54:09.392 --> 54:10.559
You called me?

54:12.317 --> 54:16.915
- You know I ain't never really
asked you for nothing, G.

54:16.915 --> 54:20.906
I need you right now, for real though.

54:20.906 --> 54:22.345
- What's good?

54:22.345 --> 54:23.928
You know I got you.

54:27.291 --> 54:29.173
- Remember that school we
was trying to get bro in?

54:29.173 --> 54:30.173
- Of course.

54:31.170 --> 54:35.118
- Well, a nigga got accepted
but they ain't give him

54:35.118 --> 54:36.451
his scholarship.

54:38.670 --> 54:42.003
Yeah, so I gotta pay for the whole shit.

54:43.288 --> 54:45.308
- That's fucked up, my nigga.

54:45.308 --> 54:46.141
Damn.

54:47.607 --> 54:48.954
We ain't never seen a
nigga from around here

54:48.954 --> 54:50.371
make it that far.

54:51.624 --> 54:54.666
- That's what I'm saying man.

54:54.666 --> 54:55.664
I don't want the nigga to have to do

54:55.664 --> 54:56.941
the shit we did, you know?

54:56.941 --> 54:57.858
- Hell nah.

54:58.892 --> 55:00.935
- So you can give it me.

55:00.935 --> 55:02.700
I'll be on the block 25 hours a day

55:02.700 --> 55:05.718
to get that shit back to you, dog.

55:05.718 --> 55:08.110
- That's little bro too, man.

55:08.110 --> 55:09.225
If he make it, we all make it.

55:09.225 --> 55:10.850
- I'm saying.

55:10.850 --> 55:13.149
- I'll see what I can do.

55:13.149 --> 55:16.028
Figure out the numbers
for the first year, man.

55:16.028 --> 55:17.909
- Alright, bet.

55:17.909 --> 55:21.409
How do you want me to pay you back though?

55:23.214 --> 55:25.443
- Hey look, we'll worry about
all that shit later man.

55:25.443 --> 55:27.115
Make sure little bro ready to go crazy

55:27.115 --> 55:28.810
on niggas in college, man.

55:28.810 --> 55:30.575
- No doubt, no doubt.

55:30.575 --> 55:31.666
You're a real nigga boy.

55:31.666 --> 55:33.999
(chuckling)

55:35.448 --> 55:37.143
You're a real nigga, man.

55:37.143 --> 55:39.000
What the fuck you about to get into?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.880
- Bout to go bump into Flash and Tay.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.250
- Tay.

55:43.250 --> 55:44.295
Hurry the fuck up.

55:44.295 --> 55:46.756
You know I got somewhere to be.

55:46.756 --> 55:48.405
- Give me a minute, baby.

55:48.405 --> 55:49.960
Yeah I know it's hot
than a motherfucker bro,

55:49.960 --> 55:51.028
but it's drought time.

55:51.028 --> 55:52.027
You know that.

55:52.027 --> 55:53.815
But I can get it for
the 35 for a whole one.

55:53.815 --> 55:55.394
Go half on one of those with me.

55:55.394 --> 55:56.741
- Let's a little smoother man,

55:56.741 --> 55:58.946
but I'm gonna see what I can put together.

55:58.946 --> 55:59.922
- For sure, fuck with me.

55:59.922 --> 56:01.176
Gotta fuck with me.

56:01.176 --> 56:03.196
- Alright, what's up with you and Bug?

56:03.196 --> 56:04.914
Man, ya'll still beefing?

56:04.914 --> 56:06.029
- I ain't studying them niggas.

56:06.029 --> 56:07.700
It is what it is bro?

56:07.700 --> 56:09.604
- Hey look man, you know what I'll say.

56:09.604 --> 56:11.230
That shit get out of hand,

56:11.230 --> 56:12.313
hood get hot,

56:13.552 --> 56:15.386
bodies get to dropping.

56:15.386 --> 56:17.360
And then the money slow up.
- And then the money slow up.

56:17.360 --> 56:18.382
I hear you my nigga.

56:18.382 --> 56:19.635
For sure, I hear you.

56:19.635 --> 56:21.191
- Hey look, let's avoid all that my nigga.

56:21.191 --> 56:22.631
- All the time.

56:22.631 --> 56:23.629
- Hurry the fuck up.

56:23.629 --> 56:24.976
What's taking you so long, damn.

56:24.976 --> 56:26.143
- Bitch, wait.

56:27.043 --> 56:29.341
And what the fuck is you
rubbernecking and shit for?

56:29.341 --> 56:30.804
Lay back with your big head ass.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.382
Yeah man, I gotta get the
fuck up outta here, bro.

56:33.382 --> 56:34.891
- Man, stay out the way man.

56:34.891 --> 56:36.307
- All the time.

56:36.307 --> 56:38.557
(gunshots)

56:45.222 --> 56:47.472
(gunshots)

56:59.665 --> 57:03.404
- [Murda] I had so many
questions when G-Lo died.

57:03.404 --> 57:06.724
But there was one I just
couldn't understand.

57:06.724 --> 57:09.998
How could a man with a heart like his

57:09.998 --> 57:11.748
turn such cold blood?

57:13.086 --> 57:16.586
Momma would always say never question God.

57:17.545 --> 57:19.295
But I needed answers.

57:20.865 --> 57:22.198
- Hey yo, Murda.

57:25.741 --> 57:28.574
Oh nah, it ain't nothing
like that big baby.

57:28.574 --> 57:31.491
I'm Renzo, G-Lo's business partner.

57:34.263 --> 57:35.633
I just got finished paying my respects,

57:35.633 --> 57:37.165
seen you over here.

57:37.165 --> 57:38.930
So I had to come over
here and introduce myself.

57:38.930 --> 57:41.347
G-Lo told me a lot about you.

57:44.410 --> 57:45.910
- My bad, big dog.

57:47.243 --> 57:50.480
I'm just a little fucked
up right now, you know?

57:50.480 --> 57:52.268
- Yeah, we all fucked up.

57:52.268 --> 57:55.217
On a lighter note, G
told me you had a brother

57:55.217 --> 57:56.703
that's probably gonna go to the league.

57:56.703 --> 58:00.036
Say he's cold at that hooping shit, huh?

58:01.161 --> 58:02.717
- [Murda] I hope so man.

58:02.717 --> 58:04.714
That's the plan.

58:04.714 --> 58:06.641
- Well, you know,
anything I can do to help.

58:06.641 --> 58:07.474
Anything.

58:08.591 --> 58:09.424
I got you.

58:11.239 --> 58:13.700
- What you say your name was again?

58:13.700 --> 58:15.511
- [Renzo] Renzo.

58:15.511 --> 58:16.344
- Renzo.

58:17.554 --> 58:21.721
- Hey but look, I've got
some of G-Lo's belongings.

58:22.593 --> 58:23.592
Why don't you leave me your number.

58:23.592 --> 58:27.675
I'll get with you man and
get it to you tomorrow.

58:46.074 --> 58:47.936
I'm gonna get with you.

58:47.936 --> 58:48.888
Stay out of trouble, man.

58:48.888 --> 58:49.721
Stay up.

59:13.710 --> 59:15.460
- Baby, what's wrong?

59:22.440 --> 59:24.159
- I'm alright.

59:24.159 --> 59:26.945
- Look, don't start that.

59:26.945 --> 59:29.406
I know how you are when you
really don't want to talk.

59:29.406 --> 59:31.906
Just let me know what's wrong.

59:36.187 --> 59:39.298
- I can't believe they killed G-Lo man.

59:39.298 --> 59:40.131
I can't.

59:43.083 --> 59:47.250
Every time I needed the
nigga, he was right there.

59:49.724 --> 59:51.557
Any time he needed me.

59:56.109 --> 59:58.547
I wasn't even around.

59:58.547 --> 01:00:02.332
- Look baby, you can't think like that.

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.702
And I hope you ain't thinking about

01:00:03.702 --> 01:00:05.369
doing nothing crazy.

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.950
I know from experience,
and it's not worth it.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:09.783
Trust me.

01:00:12.479 --> 01:00:14.812
- It's all worth my respect.

01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:20.235
You think I'm gonna let
them take one of mine

01:00:20.235 --> 01:00:23.230
without taking none of theirs.

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:26.899
- That is so crazy that
you're thinking like that.

01:00:26.899 --> 01:00:30.103
What about your little brother and sister?

01:00:30.103 --> 01:00:31.311
Did you ever stop to think about

01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:35.699
how they'll feel if anything
ever happened to you?

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:37.905
They'll have no guidance.

01:00:37.905 --> 01:00:38.738
No help.

01:00:41.435 --> 01:00:42.352
And no you.

01:00:44.593 --> 01:00:48.676
And I don't want nothing
to happen to you either.

01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:50.534
- Right.

01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:52.484
- Okay.

01:00:54.066 --> 01:00:55.343
Now, you can just start
thinking about your boy

01:00:55.343 --> 01:00:59.510
being in a better place and
away from all this drama.

01:01:02.542 --> 01:01:04.701
Now let's talk about something else.

01:01:04.701 --> 01:01:08.868
What's going on with JR and
his whole school situation?

01:01:10.297 --> 01:01:12.549
- It's some more bullshit.

01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:14.291
_ [Carmen] What?

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:17.402
- He got accepted, but he
ain't get the scholarship so

01:01:17.402 --> 01:01:20.485
I've gotta pay that out of my pocket.

01:01:22.859 --> 01:01:24.942
I mean, they want 40,000.

01:01:26.969 --> 01:01:29.719
G-Lo was gonna give it to me but.

01:01:33.842 --> 01:01:34.841
- Okay.

01:01:34.841 --> 01:01:38.008
Alright, when does the semester start?

01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:40.875
- August.

01:01:42.689 --> 01:01:44.022
- Okay, alright.

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.613
Baby don't stress.

01:01:46.613 --> 01:01:48.239
Okay.

01:01:48.239 --> 01:01:51.048
We'll figure it out together.

01:01:51.048 --> 01:01:52.215
Alright, baby.

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.968
Alright, what do you want me to feed you?

01:01:57.968 --> 01:01:58.885
- I'm cool.

01:02:00.057 --> 01:02:01.056
I'm gonna wait for Brandon to get off.

01:02:01.056 --> 01:02:02.310
Eat with them.

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:03.143
- Okay.

01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:07.395
Alright, well before they get home,

01:02:07.395 --> 01:02:09.229
I got something for you to eat.

01:02:09.229 --> 01:02:11.479
(laughing)

01:02:16.172 --> 01:02:19.672
("Dive In" by Trey Songz)

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.337
- You're looking good.

01:03:34.337 --> 01:03:35.358
(chuckles)

01:03:35.358 --> 01:03:36.775
- Thank you baby.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.074
- So you finally wore
that big ass ring I paid

01:03:39.074 --> 01:03:40.397
all that money for, huh?

01:03:40.397 --> 01:03:41.396
(chuckling)

01:03:41.396 --> 01:03:42.719
- [Carmen] Shut up.

01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:44.182
You know I don't like to
wear this big ol' thing

01:03:44.182 --> 01:03:45.180
unless I'm with you.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.930
- [Renzo] Yeah I see.

01:03:47.905 --> 01:03:48.903
- What's up, Renzo.

01:03:48.903 --> 01:03:50.157
I'm leavin now, so when y'all are done,

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:51.945
Ray's in the back and he'll lock up.

01:03:51.945 --> 01:03:53.195
Enjoy yourself.

01:03:57.982 --> 01:04:00.397
- What the fuck is that?

01:04:00.397 --> 01:04:03.718
You must be fucking this bitch too.

01:04:03.718 --> 01:04:04.716
- Man, you tripping.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:05.738
Man that's the owner.

01:04:05.738 --> 01:04:06.821
- Yeah I bet.

01:04:09.314 --> 01:04:10.846
- Well, anyway,

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:12.518
you pick up the rent money from Lana?

01:04:12.518 --> 01:04:16.164
- I told you I went
over there this morning.

01:04:16.164 --> 01:04:17.836
- She say anything about the leak?

01:04:17.836 --> 01:04:20.778
- She said it's leaking real bad.

01:04:20.778 --> 01:04:21.611
- Damn.

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:23.936
I've been so busy man, I gotta make sure

01:04:23.936 --> 01:04:25.144
I get over there, huh?

01:04:25.144 --> 01:04:27.048
- Yeah you do.

01:04:27.048 --> 01:04:30.925
Look, I've been thinking about
what we were talking about,

01:04:30.925 --> 01:04:35.092
about good timing and all
of that for renovations.

01:04:36.127 --> 01:04:39.819
And lately, I've just been
feeling a lot different.

01:04:39.819 --> 01:04:43.348
I'm tired of looking at the old layout.

01:04:43.348 --> 01:04:45.681
I'm ready for something new.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:50.012
- How much you need?

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:51.595
- Just like 40,000.

01:04:55.539 --> 01:04:56.746
- That's it?

01:04:56.746 --> 01:04:57.579
- Yeah.

01:05:00.786 --> 01:05:03.433
- So I'll get it to you later then.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:04.433
- Thank you.

01:05:10.353 --> 01:05:11.186
What?

01:05:14.974 --> 01:05:18.724
- Don't think I ain't
notice a change in you.

01:05:21.591 --> 01:05:24.091
We ain't been arguing as much.

01:05:25.446 --> 01:05:28.029
You ain't been tripping lately.

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:31.927
I don't know what it is,

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:34.717
but I like it.

01:05:38.937 --> 01:05:42.687
Guess I couldn't ask
for a better woman, huh?

01:05:54.146 --> 01:05:56.063
- Alright, just listen.

01:05:57.141 --> 01:06:01.414
I know that you've been
going through a lot,

01:06:01.414 --> 01:06:03.248
and trying to grind and make things happen

01:06:03.248 --> 01:06:05.081
for JR and everything.

01:06:06.359 --> 01:06:08.844
And just like you came into my life

01:06:08.844 --> 01:06:11.305
and you took some stress away,

01:06:11.305 --> 01:06:14.045
can I do the same for you?

01:06:14.045 --> 01:06:16.962
So here is 40,000 for JR's tuition.

01:06:19.966 --> 01:06:21.429
Listen.

01:06:21.429 --> 01:06:23.751
All he has to do is just
go choose his apartment,

01:06:23.751 --> 01:06:25.446
wherever he wants to be at.

01:06:25.446 --> 01:06:27.188
And then, everything else left over

01:06:27.188 --> 01:06:29.788
they'll just reimburse him for it.

01:06:29.788 --> 01:06:31.994
(both laughing)

01:06:31.994 --> 01:06:34.548
- I mean, I couldn't take this.

01:06:34.548 --> 01:06:35.881
- What you mean?

01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:37.787
Baby, look.

01:06:39.192 --> 01:06:43.395
I mean you came into my
life and changed everything.

01:06:43.395 --> 01:06:45.671
I mean, you don't have
to have time for me,

01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:49.525
and make me happy, you
make me smile everyday.

01:06:49.525 --> 01:06:52.985
You don't have to do none of that.

01:06:52.985 --> 01:06:55.261
Just kinda look at it as a repayment

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:59.344
for coming into my life
and changing all of that.

01:07:00.276 --> 01:07:02.552
(mumbling)

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:04.177
(laughing)

01:07:04.177 --> 01:07:05.547
Stupid.

01:07:05.547 --> 01:07:08.464
(bass heavy music)

01:07:29.069 --> 01:07:31.902
- [Renzo] What's up, big boy.

01:07:31.902 --> 01:07:35.222
- Shit, staying out these niggas' way.

01:07:35.222 --> 01:07:36.546
- Yeah, I'm on the same shit man.

01:07:36.546 --> 01:07:39.030
Staying the fuck out these niggas' way.

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:39.863
- Yeah?

01:07:42.885 --> 01:07:45.555
How you doing that in
this pretty motherfucker?

01:07:45.555 --> 01:07:46.762
What's that, a sport?

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.016
- Yeah, man.

01:07:48.016 --> 01:07:49.828
I had bought this shit for
my little ho and shit man,

01:07:49.828 --> 01:07:52.033
but it was too much
velocity for her, you know?

01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:55.284
So I kept this pretty motherfucker.

01:07:55.284 --> 01:07:57.792
- Yeah, I'd have kept it to.

01:07:57.792 --> 01:07:58.999
- Take this motherfucker
around the corner,

01:07:58.999 --> 01:08:01.554
see what it do, you can.

01:08:01.554 --> 01:08:02.575
- Nah man, I'm cool.

01:08:02.575 --> 01:08:06.128
You know, I ain't into
the speed and all that.

01:08:06.128 --> 01:08:08.795
(police sirens)

01:08:09.727 --> 01:08:13.465
- Man, why the fuck this hood so hot?

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:15.277
- I take it you ain't
from around here, huh?

01:08:15.277 --> 01:08:16.109
- Nah.

01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:19.642
Got a lot of business going
on around here though,

01:08:19.642 --> 01:08:22.939
but I do what the fuck I
gotta do and get the fuck on.

01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:24.564
- Yeah.

01:08:24.564 --> 01:08:27.258
I get my money and go in too.

01:08:27.258 --> 01:08:28.627
- Oh yeah.

01:08:28.627 --> 01:08:29.788
(chuckles)

01:08:29.788 --> 01:08:31.554
To your queen?

01:08:31.554 --> 01:08:32.854
Yeah I heard you on the phone.

01:08:32.854 --> 01:08:35.339
Nigga, what are you married or something?

01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:38.194
- Nah man, you know, that's my lady.

01:08:38.194 --> 01:08:40.656
She hold me down so she royal to me.

01:08:40.656 --> 01:08:43.140
I call her my queen.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.474
- Well, I call them bitches.

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:47.854
Maybe even hoes.

01:08:47.854 --> 01:08:50.594
How I play it, I don't give a fuck.

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:53.011
- Yeah, I mean no disrespect.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:58.234
But you know, some niggas have
hoes so they call them that.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:01.299
I got a lady, it's a little different.

01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:03.596
- Yeah that's real.

01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:05.096
Foolish, but real.

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:15.314
G-Lo's belongings.

01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:20.582
- All this?

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.263
- You know how G-Lo used to play it man.

01:09:24.263 --> 01:09:26.515
But look, I'm gonna
get back to these hoes.

01:09:26.515 --> 01:09:28.848
(chuckling)

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.603
Anything you need from
me, man let me know.

01:09:49.142 --> 01:09:50.475
Lighten up, man.

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:23.694
- Baby, I need some new shoes and a bag.

01:10:23.694 --> 01:10:24.692
(laughing)

01:10:24.692 --> 01:10:25.946
- What happened to the shoes and bag

01:10:25.946 --> 01:10:27.037
I bought you last week?

01:10:27.037 --> 01:10:28.198
What you lost it or something?

01:10:28.198 --> 01:10:29.197
- No.

01:10:29.197 --> 01:10:30.195
I wore it already.

01:10:30.195 --> 01:10:31.240
Duh.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.238
- So that explains it huh?

01:10:32.238 --> 01:10:33.237
- Yes.

01:10:33.237 --> 01:10:34.560
- So how much you need?

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.643
- Well, I need the shoes and the bag.

01:10:39.878 --> 01:10:41.782
Maybe a watch of course.

01:10:41.782 --> 01:10:43.454
But you know, you're
only getting what I need.

01:10:43.454 --> 01:10:45.149
I got everything I want.

01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:47.285
- Yeah I got you.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.375
But I don't wanna hear
no weak ass excuse about

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.256
you with that weak ass nigga either.

01:10:51.256 --> 01:10:52.231
(laughing)

01:10:52.231 --> 01:10:53.229
- Okay.

01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:54.367
- Because I'm fucking you tonight.

01:10:54.367 --> 01:10:55.598
All night.

01:10:55.598 --> 01:10:58.036
Might as well bring a friend too.

01:10:58.036 --> 01:10:59.433
- Oh I got you.

01:10:59.433 --> 01:11:01.372
- [Murda] What up though.

01:11:01.372 --> 01:11:02.205
- Oh let me holler at my man.

01:11:02.205 --> 01:11:04.185
Go grab that carryout for me.

01:11:04.185 --> 01:11:05.018
- Okay.

01:11:10.175 --> 01:11:11.522
- [Renzo] What's up big boy?

01:11:11.522 --> 01:11:14.054
- She working with all that.

01:11:14.054 --> 01:11:15.304
- I see, I see.

01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:18.867
- What's that?

01:11:18.867 --> 01:11:20.176
One of your hoes?

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.009
(chuckles)

01:11:21.009 --> 01:11:22.425
- No, my queen man.

01:11:22.425 --> 01:11:23.586
(laughing)

01:11:23.586 --> 01:11:24.586
What's good?

01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:29.028
- Hey, man I came and hollered at you.

01:11:31.457 --> 01:11:34.124
I'm a little confused, my nigga.

01:11:37.866 --> 01:11:40.533
You sure that was the right bag?

01:11:48.199 --> 01:11:51.496
- It's definitely the right bag.

01:11:51.496 --> 01:11:53.679
I just hope it ain't the wrong nigga.

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:56.346
(phone ringing)

01:11:58.787 --> 01:12:01.870
You know how to answer a phone right?

01:12:06.728 --> 01:12:09.933
- Just like that, there it was.

01:12:09.933 --> 01:12:12.789
A duffle bag full of clothes.

01:12:12.789 --> 01:12:15.372
And under it, 300 grams of raw.

01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:22.379
This cat Lorenzo's alright.

01:12:22.379 --> 01:12:25.049
He had me getting some serious paper.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:26.382
We was clicking.

01:12:27.626 --> 01:12:29.554
As long as he got his money back on time,

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:31.221
I got what I needed.

01:12:32.503 --> 01:12:34.871
Shit was in motion.

01:12:34.871 --> 01:12:37.890
Carmen was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:40.630
Too goddamn silly at times,

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:43.044
but that's what I loved about her.

01:12:43.044 --> 01:12:45.715
Because of her, JR got
his money for school.

01:12:45.715 --> 01:12:47.132
She held me down.

01:12:49.569 --> 01:12:51.589
Carmen was amazing.

01:12:51.589 --> 01:12:54.538
And it ain't a better feeling in the world

01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:57.621
than knowing that Carmen is all mine.

01:13:24.097 --> 01:13:26.680
- How you doing today, Lorenzo?

01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:31.226
- We've been watching you.

01:13:31.226 --> 01:13:34.152
We could really give a
fuck less how you're doing.

01:13:34.152 --> 01:13:35.522
- Hey look, am I under arrest or something

01:13:35.522 --> 01:13:37.983
because I'm a little late for work.

01:13:37.983 --> 01:13:39.144
(laughing)
- What kind of job you got

01:13:39.144 --> 01:13:41.187
that pays you enough money to ride around

01:13:41.187 --> 01:13:44.020
in fancy cars in the hood all day?

01:13:45.019 --> 01:13:46.551
- Well, these was gifts.

01:13:46.551 --> 01:13:48.455
- Oh you're funny.

01:13:48.455 --> 01:13:50.940
Damn, you must have some
awfully rich friends.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.940
- Very rich.

01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:55.676
And powerful too.

01:13:55.676 --> 01:13:57.259
- Is that a threat?

01:13:58.254 --> 01:13:59.810
- Nah, but you know what?

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:00.643
- What?

01:14:05.777 --> 01:14:07.565
- I'm gonna just keep my mouth shut.

01:14:07.565 --> 01:14:08.633
(chuckling)

01:14:08.633 --> 01:14:10.351
- Smart man.

01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:11.652
That's what you better do.

01:14:11.652 --> 01:14:14.392
- No, that's what you'd better not do.

01:14:14.392 --> 01:14:17.975
You need to talk if
you value that freedom.

01:14:21.381 --> 01:14:22.631
Here's my card.

01:14:25.139 --> 01:14:27.472
(chuckling)

01:14:34.822 --> 01:14:35.821
(sighing)

01:14:35.821 --> 01:14:38.770
- Man, I couldn't keep
holding this motherfucker.

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:39.838
(chuckling)

01:14:39.838 --> 01:14:41.301
- Boy you've been tripping all day

01:14:41.301 --> 01:14:44.435
like your wee-wee bout
to fall off or something.

01:14:44.435 --> 01:14:47.431
- It's been a long time
since I had a wee-wee.

01:14:47.431 --> 01:14:48.847
This motherfucker more like a wow-wow.

01:14:48.847 --> 01:14:50.097
- Boy, shut up.

01:14:51.239 --> 01:14:53.816
Yo what was up with the coach
being so hard on JR today?

01:14:53.816 --> 01:14:57.647
- Because that little nigga
was acting like a broad today.

01:14:57.647 --> 01:14:58.692
- No, baby.

01:14:58.692 --> 01:15:00.805
I think he was just having
an off day, that's all.

01:15:00.805 --> 01:15:02.640
- I don't know what it was.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.544
I ain't tripping though.

01:15:04.544 --> 01:15:06.517
I know the little nigga got it.

01:15:06.517 --> 01:15:09.745
- Yeah, that nigga got
that clutch shot like Kobe.

01:15:09.745 --> 01:15:11.603
- Them real skills like Lebron.

01:15:11.603 --> 01:15:13.553
- No why you always gotta
mention Lebron's weak ass?

01:15:13.553 --> 01:15:15.689
- Why you always gotta
talk about Kobe's weak ass?

01:15:15.689 --> 01:15:16.734
- Whatever.

01:15:16.734 --> 01:15:18.081
- The fuck.

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:19.544
Aye, what I do?

01:15:19.544 --> 01:15:20.844
- You said you wanted to holler at me.

01:15:20.844 --> 01:15:21.843
- Oh nothing baby.

01:15:21.843 --> 01:15:22.888
It wasn't a big deal.

01:15:22.888 --> 01:15:23.886
I just wanted to let you know

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:27.415
that I'm going out of town
so I just wanted to make sure

01:15:27.415 --> 01:15:29.761
you had everything you needed.

01:15:29.761 --> 01:15:33.476
(mumbling)
(giggling)

01:15:33.476 --> 01:15:34.309
Oh, hey.

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:38.347
Here comes the man of the hour.

01:15:38.347 --> 01:15:39.763
- [Murda] What's up though?

01:15:39.763 --> 01:15:41.969
- Tough day today man.

01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:45.719
- Yeah I seem them niggas
was fucking you up.

01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:48.007
- Yeah, cakewalk.

01:15:49.283 --> 01:15:50.955
- You look like the motherfucking cake.

01:15:50.955 --> 01:15:52.232
Them niggas was eating you alive.

01:15:52.232 --> 01:15:53.858
- Oh baby shut up.

01:15:53.858 --> 01:15:55.924
Look, do not listen to your brother.

01:15:55.924 --> 01:15:57.410
You did a good job, bro.

01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:58.409
- Thanks.

01:15:58.409 --> 01:16:00.669
At least somebody gave me a break today.

01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:02.417
(sighing)

01:16:02.417 --> 01:16:03.250
- Aye bro, come on man.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.083
I'm just fucking with you.

01:16:04.083 --> 01:16:04.945
You hungry?

01:16:04.945 --> 01:16:05.945
- [JR] Yeah.

01:16:08.381 --> 01:16:09.798
- Hey.

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.516
If we had to pay with that performance,

01:16:11.516 --> 01:16:12.909
we'd be some hungry motherfuckers.

01:16:12.909 --> 01:16:13.742
- Shut up.

01:16:37.146 --> 01:16:38.145
- What's good, my dog.

01:16:38.145 --> 01:16:39.352
You was looking for me?

01:16:39.352 --> 01:16:41.102
- [Murda] Yeah I was.

01:16:42.046 --> 01:16:43.369
- Between me and you,

01:16:43.369 --> 01:16:45.157
that was some foul ass
shit with you running up

01:16:45.157 --> 01:16:47.061
in my spot like that, man.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:48.199
- [Murda] Nigga that
was some foul ass shit

01:16:48.199 --> 01:16:49.964
with you not paying your debt.

01:16:49.964 --> 01:16:52.193
I don't give a fuck if G dead or not.

01:16:52.193 --> 01:16:53.693
I need that paper.

01:16:55.397 --> 01:16:56.605
- Listen here, my nigga.

01:16:56.605 --> 01:16:58.067
I don't want no problems.

01:16:58.067 --> 01:16:59.902
It was just a little misunderstanding.

01:16:59.902 --> 01:17:01.133
But you run up in my shit like that

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:02.595
like you're running something,

01:17:02.595 --> 01:17:04.174
all the fuck you had to do is call me,

01:17:04.174 --> 01:17:05.544
and we could've kicked it.

01:17:05.544 --> 01:17:08.772
- And all the fuck you had
to do is pay your debt.

01:17:08.772 --> 01:17:11.187
I shouldn't have had to
come looking for you.

01:17:11.187 --> 01:17:13.091
- You know what, you're right.

01:17:13.091 --> 01:17:14.600
Here goes that five Gs.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.040
Now let me get that work and that money

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.040
you took up out my spot.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.286
- Nigga, the money is spent

01:17:22.286 --> 01:17:24.869
and the work is in the streets.

01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:29.597
- So that means you're good huh?

01:17:30.599 --> 01:17:32.874
- I don't know about good.

01:17:32.874 --> 01:17:34.124
But we're even.

01:17:36.427 --> 01:17:38.749
- That's all I need to hear, my nigga.

01:17:38.749 --> 01:17:41.837
You just be careful out here.

01:17:41.837 --> 01:17:43.207
- Nigga, fuck you.

01:17:43.207 --> 01:17:44.275
- [Pooh] Yeah, alright.

01:17:44.275 --> 01:17:45.108
Stay up.

01:17:52.936 --> 01:17:55.467
- [Murda] Not only did
this nigga Pooh owe money.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:56.675
A couple days later I find out,

01:17:56.675 --> 01:17:59.159
he put the play down on
G-Lo because G-Lo was

01:17:59.159 --> 01:18:00.659
fucking his bitch.

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.643
So I hit his spots.

01:18:05.754 --> 01:18:09.087
I couldn't find him so I sent a message.

01:18:11.443 --> 01:18:15.110
And before he could
respond, I sent another.

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:24.007
See, Pooh killed one of mine.

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.933
So I killed his brother.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:36.706
And I know Renzo might
be mad and all that,

01:18:36.706 --> 01:18:40.623
but to me, business never
comes before respect.

01:18:47.454 --> 01:18:48.847
- What's up big boy?

01:18:48.847 --> 01:18:51.540
- Shit, hold it down like always.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:52.632
- Yeah I see, I see.

01:18:52.632 --> 01:18:53.955
Nah, hold that for a minute.

01:18:53.955 --> 01:18:55.581
I'll get that in a second.

01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:57.624
Hey look, what's this shit I hear

01:18:57.624 --> 01:19:01.313
about you and Pooh having
a couple of words, though?

01:19:01.313 --> 01:19:03.728
- Man, fuck that nigga.

01:19:03.728 --> 01:19:06.630
That nigga mad disrespectful.

01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:07.629
- Come on, man.

01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:09.463
You know what G used to say.

01:19:09.463 --> 01:19:11.344
Bodies get to dropping.

01:19:11.344 --> 01:19:12.876
Hood get hot.

01:19:12.876 --> 01:19:13.875
And the money slows up.

01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:14.873
Man, you know we don't need that baby.

01:19:14.873 --> 01:19:16.243
Come on.

01:19:16.243 --> 01:19:17.076
- Right.

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:20.701
- For real, my dog.

01:19:20.701 --> 01:19:21.700
- I said right.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.931
What's up with you though?

01:19:22.931 --> 01:19:24.649
I see you finally came from hiding.

01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:28.527
- No man I went on a little
vacay with my lady man.

01:19:28.527 --> 01:19:29.525
You the crazy part?

01:19:29.525 --> 01:19:31.847
That shit you was talking
about with the queen shit,

01:19:31.847 --> 01:19:33.635
yeah fuck them hoes my nigga.

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:35.957
- Now you feeling me, now you feeling me?

01:19:35.957 --> 01:19:37.234
- Went out there and bonded and shit, man.

01:19:37.234 --> 01:19:38.534
Shit wasn't half bad you know?

01:19:38.534 --> 01:19:39.579
- I told you.

01:19:39.579 --> 01:19:40.833
Ain't no better feeling in the world.

01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:43.500
Especially when she's all yours.

01:19:44.432 --> 01:19:46.731
- Hey speaking of my
queen, hey meet Murda.

01:19:46.731 --> 01:19:47.799
Murda meet Carmen.

01:19:47.799 --> 01:19:49.425
- Hey how you doing?

01:19:49.425 --> 01:19:50.423
- What's up baby.

01:19:50.423 --> 01:19:54.590
(distant voices)
(ominous music)

01:20:07.675 --> 01:20:09.069
What's up big boy, you straight?

01:20:09.069 --> 01:20:11.275
- Yeah, I'm cool.

01:20:11.275 --> 01:20:13.442
I just seen this little ho

01:20:16.058 --> 01:20:18.475
ass nigga I was beefing with.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.095
- Where that nigga at?

01:20:22.095 --> 01:20:23.186
- Nigga kept it moving man.

01:20:23.186 --> 01:20:25.621
He ain't want no smoke.

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:26.759
- Man we just talked about that, baby.

01:20:26.759 --> 01:20:28.245
You gotta calm down man.

01:20:28.245 --> 01:20:30.614
Let's get this money.

01:20:30.614 --> 01:20:32.471
- I be tripping sometimes.

01:20:32.471 --> 01:20:35.025
- I'm gonna get that a
little later though, man.

01:20:35.025 --> 01:20:36.651
Motherfuckers probably
out here taking pictures

01:20:36.651 --> 01:20:38.532
as we speak and shit.

01:20:38.532 --> 01:20:39.995
But I'm gonna get on you.

01:20:39.995 --> 01:20:41.016
- [Murda] Alright.

01:20:41.016 --> 01:20:42.599
- [Renzo] My nigga.

01:20:46.752 --> 01:20:47.585
- Aye.

01:20:53.485 --> 01:20:56.852
She everything you deserve my nigga.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:57.769
- My nigga.

01:20:59.337 --> 01:21:01.920
(somber music)

01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:41.137
(sports news announcements)

01:22:46.084 --> 01:22:48.685
(rap music)

01:22:48.685 --> 01:22:50.891
(knock at the door)

01:22:50.891 --> 01:22:51.891
- Who is it?

01:22:56.255 --> 01:22:59.338
Who is it?
(knocking)

01:23:17.687 --> 01:23:18.520
What's up?

01:23:20.171 --> 01:23:23.254
- I just wanted to come to apologize.

01:23:25.651 --> 01:23:28.089
- Apologize for what?

01:23:28.089 --> 01:23:30.086
We both know what it is.

01:23:30.086 --> 01:23:31.253
You played me.

01:23:34.266 --> 01:23:38.433
I'm just pissed I was too
pussy whipped to realize.

01:23:39.374 --> 01:23:42.416
I mean an apology from a
well-known slut ain't needed.

01:23:42.416 --> 01:23:44.575
- You don't have to disrespect me.

01:23:44.575 --> 01:23:46.781
- Disrespect you?

01:23:46.781 --> 01:23:50.775
Bitch, what about how you disrespected me?

01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:52.842
You fucked with me the long way

01:23:52.842 --> 01:23:56.023
in a full blown relationship
with a nigga I knew.

01:23:56.023 --> 01:24:00.899
- Look, I didn't mean for
things to go down like that.

01:24:00.899 --> 01:24:04.521
- So how long did you expect
to pull the wool over my eyes?

01:24:04.521 --> 01:24:05.984
How long did you think
you could fuck two niggas

01:24:05.984 --> 01:24:07.819
that know each other?

01:24:07.819 --> 01:24:09.236
How long, Carmen?

01:24:10.744 --> 01:24:11.744
Dirty bitch.

01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:14.229
Yeah, filth.

01:24:15.690 --> 01:24:16.735
- [Carmen] Look I didn't even know

01:24:16.735 --> 01:24:18.985
that y'all knew each other.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.157
- You knew.

01:24:24.792 --> 01:24:26.093
I know you knew.

01:24:26.093 --> 01:24:28.624
And even if you didn't, what
you think that shit's cool

01:24:28.624 --> 01:24:29.707
or something?

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:34.429
I mean, all you had to do was
tell me you had a nigga, baby.

01:24:34.429 --> 01:24:38.539
And I would've fucked and
that would've been that.

01:24:38.539 --> 01:24:41.255
- Look, was I with
somebody when I met you?

01:24:41.255 --> 01:24:42.088
Yes.

01:24:43.183 --> 01:24:45.110
But did I think that things
would happen like this?

01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.943
No.

01:24:48.546 --> 01:24:51.713
I finally found somebody who loves me.

01:24:58.252 --> 01:25:00.419
Murda, I know you love me.

01:25:02.246 --> 01:25:05.079
And baby, I'm so in love with you.

01:25:06.008 --> 01:25:06.841
I'm sorry.

01:25:09.352 --> 01:25:10.559
- Hey man, miss me with all that

01:25:10.559 --> 01:25:13.299
Hallmark card shit, alright.

01:25:13.299 --> 01:25:15.737
You know what's crazy?

01:25:15.737 --> 01:25:16.898
I'm the reason why he looks at you

01:25:16.898 --> 01:25:18.898
the way he looks at you.

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:26.066
Only if you knew what he
looked at you as before.

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:28.926
And now I see why.

01:25:28.926 --> 01:25:31.846
Hey man, get the fuck
up out my crib alright?

01:25:31.846 --> 01:25:32.846
Bounce, man.

01:25:44.121 --> 01:25:45.120
- Listen.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:45.953
- Yo.

01:25:47.836 --> 01:25:49.044
Have some type of pride.

01:25:49.044 --> 01:25:49.877
Go.

01:26:08.595 --> 01:26:09.678
Filthy bitch.

01:26:38.317 --> 01:26:40.984
(phone ringing)

01:26:42.821 --> 01:26:43.654
- Hello.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:46.325
- Hey.

01:26:49.207 --> 01:26:50.252
- You okay?

01:26:50.252 --> 01:26:53.131
What, you called back to get your key?

01:26:53.131 --> 01:26:54.710
- No girl, I just left from there.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:57.311
I must've just left the spare.

01:26:57.311 --> 01:26:58.448
You can just put it up for me.

01:26:58.448 --> 01:27:00.698
I'll get it from you later.

01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:03.367
- What's wrong?

01:27:04.718 --> 01:27:07.504
- [Carmen] I'm alright, I'm just--

01:27:07.504 --> 01:27:08.712
- No you're not.

01:27:08.712 --> 01:27:09.710
You don't sound alright.

01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:10.793
What's wrong?

01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:17.778
- Going through a little
bit of something right now.

01:27:21.483 --> 01:27:24.733
- Carmen, stop talking to me like that.

01:27:24.733 --> 01:27:25.732
What's wrong?

01:27:25.732 --> 01:27:26.753
Speak to me.

01:27:26.753 --> 01:27:27.670
Talk to me.

01:27:30.422 --> 01:27:33.422
- Murda found out about Renzo today.

01:27:35.136 --> 01:27:35.969
- What?

01:27:37.829 --> 01:27:39.571
How the fuck did he find out about that?

01:27:39.571 --> 01:27:40.616
How?

01:27:40.616 --> 01:27:44.699
- So, me and Renzo had
just came from out of town

01:27:46.467 --> 01:27:48.975
and we went to this restaurant.

01:27:48.975 --> 01:27:50.368
And then, the next thing I know,

01:27:50.368 --> 01:27:53.619
I'm walking outside and Murda is

01:27:53.619 --> 01:27:56.196
standing with Renzo talking.

01:27:56.196 --> 01:28:00.631
Mind you, I had no idea
they even knew each other.

01:28:00.631 --> 01:28:02.001
I guess he must've called him out there

01:28:02.001 --> 01:28:04.439
on some business or something.

01:28:04.439 --> 01:28:08.606
So anyway, I walk outside and
he's calling me over there

01:28:09.548 --> 01:28:12.148
to introduce me to him

01:28:12.148 --> 01:28:14.029
and I couldn't do anything
but just sit there

01:28:14.029 --> 01:28:15.724
and look stupid.

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:16.557
- What?

01:28:17.675 --> 01:28:20.008
You've got to be kidding me.

01:28:21.576 --> 01:28:24.223
- [Carmen] I feel so bad for Murda.

01:28:24.223 --> 01:28:26.723
He didn't deserve any of this.

01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:29.491
- [Rachel] I mean, what about Renzo?

01:28:29.491 --> 01:28:31.070
What he trying to do--

01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:32.903
- He doesn't know yet.

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:39.893
And to be honest, I really
don't care that he doesn't.

01:28:39.893 --> 01:28:41.101
I mean look at all the stuff

01:28:41.101 --> 01:28:43.655
that he's been doing to me for years.

01:28:43.655 --> 01:28:46.488
None of that even amounts to this.

01:28:47.672 --> 01:28:50.342
- Baby girl, I got all of that.

01:28:50.342 --> 01:28:52.014
But still, you cannot be playing

01:28:52.014 --> 01:28:54.847
with these niggas hearts out here.

01:28:54.847 --> 01:28:56.426
Like we said before,
that's the closest way

01:28:56.426 --> 01:28:58.005
to end up missing.

01:28:58.005 --> 01:28:59.916
- [Carmen] Well, what am I supposed to do?

01:28:59.916 --> 01:29:02.499
Just leave Murda alone or what?

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.173
I love him so much.

01:29:20.171 --> 01:29:22.887
- Bitch, you a grown ass woman.

01:29:22.887 --> 01:29:24.327
You know what to do.

01:29:24.327 --> 01:29:26.440
You know what you've got to do.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.437
Don't be going trading lust

01:29:28.437 --> 01:29:31.804
in exchange for everything
that you've had.

01:29:31.804 --> 01:29:33.336
And me and you both know Lorenzo is

01:29:33.336 --> 01:29:36.007
everything that you've had.

01:29:36.007 --> 01:29:37.214
What, are you going to trade that in

01:29:37.214 --> 01:29:40.131
for some nigga with some new money?

01:29:41.394 --> 01:29:42.644
- You're right.

01:29:44.226 --> 01:29:46.143
- So what you gonna do?

01:29:49.126 --> 01:29:52.126
- I'm gonna wait for him to get home

01:29:54.699 --> 01:29:58.391
and I'll be the best woman I can be.

01:29:58.391 --> 01:30:00.808
- That's what I like to hear.

01:30:02.338 --> 01:30:04.962
Well call me when you do that, girl.

01:30:04.962 --> 01:30:06.378
- I will.

01:30:06.378 --> 01:30:07.461
- I love you.

01:30:10.256 --> 01:30:12.926
- I love you too, Rachel.

01:30:12.926 --> 01:30:14.676
- Please feel better.

01:30:38.468 --> 01:30:39.301
Hey yo.

01:30:44.111 --> 01:30:45.365
I think it's about time for you to go home

01:30:45.365 --> 01:30:48.448
and check up on your bitch, my nigga.

01:30:54.072 --> 01:30:55.239
She needs you.

01:31:01.781 --> 01:31:04.614
And we can finish what we started.

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:10.480
You already know who cut this head.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.267
(ominous music)

01:33:01.708 --> 01:33:02.541
- Hey.

01:33:17.776 --> 01:33:19.609
- What's the occasion?

01:33:21.213 --> 01:33:24.880
- Just trying to be the
best woman I can be.

01:33:27.366 --> 01:33:29.866
- Why in the fuck now, Carmen?

01:33:32.103 --> 01:33:33.937
- Look, you know that I love you right?

01:33:33.937 --> 01:33:36.016
- [Renzo] Right.

01:33:36.016 --> 01:33:39.594
- And no matter the circumstances,

01:33:39.594 --> 01:33:42.659
no matter what we go through,

01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:45.909
you know that I care about you so much.

01:33:53.735 --> 01:33:56.800
It's like time and time again,

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:00.217
we just keep going through the same shit.

01:34:01.792 --> 01:34:05.125
And it's like you're never gonna change.

01:34:08.108 --> 01:34:10.081
And it's so crazy because
you're all I've been knowing

01:34:10.081 --> 01:34:11.581
for over 12 years.

01:34:19.044 --> 01:34:21.065
Renzo, all I ever wanted you to do

01:34:21.065 --> 01:34:24.222
was to be honest and faithful.

01:34:24.222 --> 01:34:25.055
That's it.

01:34:32.512 --> 01:34:34.429
Renzo, I'm leaving you.

01:34:47.187 --> 01:34:49.187
I can't do this anymore.

01:35:00.608 --> 01:35:02.941
- So you're leaving me, huh?

01:35:08.271 --> 01:35:11.438
For all the shit I've done in the past

01:35:14.401 --> 01:35:16.151
or are you leaving me

01:35:18.743 --> 01:35:21.743
because you were being a slut bitch?

01:35:30.748 --> 01:35:33.415
(ominous music)

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.790
I'm the one that's leaving.

01:36:04.045 --> 01:36:07.969
What, you think I ain't
know about Murda, bitch?

01:36:07.969 --> 01:36:09.302
You dirty bitch.

01:36:10.175 --> 01:36:12.056
40,000 of my hard-earned
motherfucking cash

01:36:12.056 --> 01:36:15.389
for that poor ass nigga I put on, bitch.

01:36:18.349 --> 01:36:19.974
Bitch, and all the motherfucking business

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:21.274
me and your father got, bitch.

01:36:21.274 --> 01:36:22.900
And that's how you're gonna play me?

01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.386
That's how you gonna play me?

01:36:24.386 --> 01:36:26.553
(gunshot)

01:36:27.799 --> 01:36:30.307
Open your mouth, bitch.

01:36:30.307 --> 01:36:32.549
Open your motherfucking mouth, bitch.

01:36:32.549 --> 01:36:33.734
Open your motherfucking mouth.

01:36:33.734 --> 01:36:36.234
Open your motherfucking mouth.

01:36:42.693 --> 01:36:44.110
I got you, bitch.

01:36:45.526 --> 01:36:47.012
You hear me?

01:36:47.012 --> 01:36:48.429
You hear me?

01:36:48.429 --> 01:36:49.846
Bitch, I got you.

01:36:51.796 --> 01:36:54.796
(Carmen shuddering)

01:37:35.167 --> 01:37:37.443
(knock at door)

01:37:37.443 --> 01:37:38.443
- It's open.

01:37:52.118 --> 01:37:53.951
I'm in here, my nigga.

01:37:56.507 --> 01:37:58.712
- What's up, big boy.

01:37:58.712 --> 01:37:59.990
- [Murda] What's up my nigga.

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.988
You got lost or something?

01:38:00.988 --> 01:38:04.517
- Hell nah, I had to make a
few stops before I got here.

01:38:04.517 --> 01:38:05.934
- Fucking with them hoes huh?

01:38:05.934 --> 01:38:07.559
(laughing)

01:38:07.559 --> 01:38:09.370
Let me go grab that cheese for you.

01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:12.120
- Hey grab that phone for me too.

01:38:13.434 --> 01:38:15.222
Yeah I know.

01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:17.056
That motherfucker hot though.

01:38:17.056 --> 01:38:20.005
Gotta get rid of that bitch.

01:38:20.005 --> 01:38:21.259
- Dog, you bout to get rid of that.

01:38:21.259 --> 01:38:24.231
That bitch banging right now.

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:25.880
- Yeah but you know all good
things come to an end though,

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:26.880
you feel me?

01:38:29.734 --> 01:38:30.901
- I feel that.

01:38:31.801 --> 01:38:33.055
Let me go grab that shit for you.

01:38:33.055 --> 01:38:33.972
- For sure.

01:39:00.803 --> 01:39:03.426
- [Murda] You leaving, nigga.

01:39:03.426 --> 01:39:04.471
- No, I thought I heard
somebody fucking with

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.638
my little royal out there.

01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:20.749
- Yeah them little niggas
thieves around here.

01:39:20.749 --> 01:39:22.118
- I already know.

01:39:22.118 --> 01:39:26.252
Hey look, I'm gonna get with
you in a couple of days.

01:39:26.252 --> 01:39:28.667
I had to get a new plug.

01:39:28.667 --> 01:39:31.081
His people got on some fuck shit.

01:39:31.081 --> 01:39:34.170
So you know, I've got to handle that.

01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:38.337
I heard you say you had to
holler at me about something?

01:39:41.646 --> 01:39:45.396
- I had wanted to kick
it with you, you know.

01:39:46.569 --> 01:39:48.236
On a personal level.

01:39:53.001 --> 01:39:56.043
The other day, when I
had brought that cheese--

01:39:56.043 --> 01:39:59.043
- When I came back from out of town?

01:39:59.897 --> 01:40:02.897
I introduced you to your queen, huh?

01:40:13.829 --> 01:40:18.636
I know you ain't know she
was my bitch, my nigga.

01:40:18.636 --> 01:40:21.179
But shit, I can't hate the player.

01:40:21.179 --> 01:40:23.846
I only can hate the game, right?

01:40:27.843 --> 01:40:30.603
Can't fall out over no bitch, big boy.

01:40:30.603 --> 01:40:31.936
- Hey big homie.

01:40:38.521 --> 01:40:42.399
I mean, I don't want no bad
blood or nothing between us.

01:40:42.399 --> 01:40:45.149
You know, we had our thing going.

01:40:48.157 --> 01:40:52.311
I mean, not only do I feel disrespected.

01:40:52.311 --> 01:40:55.311
I also feel like I disrespected you.

01:40:56.235 --> 01:40:57.902
On a personal level.

01:41:03.294 --> 01:41:05.627
- Let me ask you a question.

01:41:11.722 --> 01:41:12.805
You love her?

01:41:28.255 --> 01:41:29.088
- Yeah.

01:41:31.831 --> 01:41:32.748
I love her.

01:41:42.582 --> 01:41:45.082
- She loved you too, my nigga.

01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:50.738
A couple days.

01:42:26.989 --> 01:42:29.156
(gunshot)

01:43:01.587 --> 01:43:04.698
I guess ain't nobody ever told you

01:43:04.698 --> 01:43:07.198
that love will get you killed.

01:43:11.873 --> 01:43:12.872
Hey clean this shit up, man.

01:43:12.872 --> 01:43:15.205
Get the fuck up out of here.

01:43:28.545 --> 01:43:29.497
- Now he die.

01:43:29.497 --> 01:43:31.747
(gunshots)

01:43:42.106 --> 01:43:43.963
- What's this all about?

01:43:43.963 --> 01:43:46.146
- To be totallly honest, I
really couldn't tell you.

01:43:46.146 --> 01:43:47.818
I just know pressure busts pipes

01:43:47.818 --> 01:43:50.279
and the pressure's on for Lorenzo.

01:43:50.279 --> 01:43:51.480
- Yeah that's true.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.874
What you think he's gonna show?

01:43:52.874 --> 01:43:53.872
- He has too.

01:43:53.872 --> 01:43:55.455
- What's up fellas.

01:43:59.259 --> 01:44:02.162
- Well, here we are Renzo.

01:44:02.162 --> 01:44:04.925
What did you call us down here for?

01:44:04.925 --> 01:44:06.945
- We've got a deal right?

01:44:06.945 --> 01:44:08.594
- We heard you, big fella.

01:44:08.594 --> 01:44:10.405
No jail time.

01:44:10.405 --> 01:44:11.488
So what's up?

01:44:21.968 --> 01:44:24.313
- You know those rich
friends I was talking about?

01:44:24.313 --> 01:44:25.146
- Yeah.

01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:30.072
- Those are the ones y'all looking for.

01:44:30.072 --> 01:44:32.231
See, all that dope you're
trying to pin on me,

01:44:32.231 --> 01:44:34.786
I ain't the one to blame.

01:44:34.786 --> 01:44:35.947
It's Keith Larkins.

01:44:35.947 --> 01:44:37.038
- Come on, man.

01:44:37.038 --> 01:44:38.083
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:44:38.083 --> 01:44:39.151
You're wrong.

01:44:39.151 --> 01:44:42.263
Keith Larkins been out
the drug game for years.

01:44:42.263 --> 01:44:45.346
He did his bid and never looked back.

01:44:54.453 --> 01:44:56.729
- And y'all supposed to be cops.

01:44:56.729 --> 01:44:57.890
Y'all supposed to know this, man.

01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:59.376
Come on.

01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:01.442
He's working right under y'all noses.

01:45:01.442 --> 01:45:02.394
- What are you talking...

01:45:02.394 --> 01:45:03.227
How?

01:45:05.134 --> 01:45:06.434
- Ya'll know I'm engaged
to his beautiful daughter

01:45:06.434 --> 01:45:08.176
Carmen Larkins, right?

01:45:08.176 --> 01:45:09.009
Yeah.

01:45:10.823 --> 01:45:13.818
She's the one that's
been taking care of me.

01:45:13.818 --> 01:45:15.651
I don't lift a finger.

01:45:23.385 --> 01:45:24.384
- What the fuck does his daughter

01:45:24.384 --> 01:45:26.218
have to do with any of this?

01:45:26.218 --> 01:45:29.236
- See all that shop shit, that's a front.

01:45:29.236 --> 01:45:30.069
Yeah.

01:45:32.185 --> 01:45:34.783
That's how he's moving his
work, through his daughter.

01:45:34.783 --> 01:45:37.569
She's the one moving all this
money around in the streets.

01:45:37.569 --> 01:45:40.319
I'm just reaping up the benefits.

01:45:55.878 --> 01:46:00.045
- [Carmen] Baby you know
you left the door unlocked?

01:46:03.726 --> 01:46:05.444
- So you're telling me
that his daughter is some

01:46:05.444 --> 01:46:07.777
big time heroine dealer huh?

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:09.612
- Queenpin.

01:46:11.575 --> 01:46:12.408
Yeah.

01:46:14.036 --> 01:46:16.405
Matter of fact, what time is it?

01:46:16.405 --> 01:46:17.728
- A quarter til two.

01:46:17.728 --> 01:46:18.561
Why?

01:46:23.672 --> 01:46:26.589
- [Carmen] Murda you in here sleep?

01:46:35.213 --> 01:46:38.022
- She's supposed to be
on her way to a crib.

01:46:38.022 --> 01:46:42.527
This guy named Murda owes her
pops 40,000 for some work.

01:46:42.527 --> 01:46:44.860
Yeah, and he wants him gone.

01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:49.026
- Baby.

01:46:56.250 --> 01:47:00.417
- So what you think she on
her way over there to do?

01:47:03.081 --> 01:47:04.748
- Baby, you in here?

01:47:06.053 --> 01:47:08.053
(sighs)

01:47:12.067 --> 01:47:12.900
Baby?

01:47:14.273 --> 01:47:15.190
- Kill him.

01:47:16.131 --> 01:47:18.214
(crying)

01:47:22.841 --> 01:47:24.174
- Oh no, no, no.

01:47:37.029 --> 01:47:41.196
(sobbing)
(sad music)

01:47:56.275 --> 01:47:58.435
- And y'all know that key
I gave y'all the other day?

01:47:58.435 --> 01:47:59.456
- Yeah, what about it?

01:47:59.456 --> 01:48:02.165
- Y'all need to put some use to that.

01:48:02.165 --> 01:48:03.256
Might find something in there.

01:48:03.256 --> 01:48:05.589
A little surprise for y'all.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.550
- [Murda] You see, instead of killing her,

01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:10.826
Lorenzo got even with Carmen.

01:48:10.826 --> 01:48:13.635
He gave the Feds a copy of her car keys.

01:48:13.635 --> 01:48:16.135
Same key she left at the shop.

01:48:18.279 --> 01:48:22.738
And in the car, they
found a brick and a gun.

01:48:22.738 --> 01:48:25.655
Same gun used to kill her weakness.

01:48:27.498 --> 01:48:31.677
See, Lorenzo knew his weakness was Carmen.

01:48:31.677 --> 01:48:34.094
And Carmen's weakness was me.

01:48:39.502 --> 01:48:43.335
You see love has this
aura of being beautiful.

01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:45.653
Passion.

01:48:46.724 --> 01:48:47.557
Precious.

01:48:48.907 --> 01:48:52.324
But in reality, sometimes it hinders you.

01:48:53.179 --> 01:48:55.262
Confuses you, blinds you.

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:04.033
From believing money is
the only root to all evil.

01:49:07.366 --> 01:49:09.533
When sometimes, it's love.

01:49:20.788 --> 01:49:22.041
- [JR] Bre-Bre.

01:49:22.041 --> 01:49:23.435
- [Bre] Yeah.

01:49:23.435 --> 01:49:25.199
- How much money you got left?

01:49:25.199 --> 01:49:26.282
- [Bre] None.

01:49:27.591 --> 01:49:28.424
- Here.

01:49:31.376 --> 01:49:33.675
Girl, you be killing me.

01:49:33.675 --> 01:49:35.184
You probably should just cook later, huh?

01:49:35.184 --> 01:49:36.182
- No.

01:49:36.182 --> 01:49:37.204
- Come here.

01:49:37.204 --> 01:49:38.203
- What?

01:49:38.203 --> 01:49:39.689
- Can you get that lotion
for your big brother?

01:49:39.689 --> 01:49:41.522
- You've got two legs.

01:49:42.939 --> 01:49:44.263
- Where are you in a rush to go?

01:49:44.263 --> 01:49:45.586
- [Bre] I'm going to Maury's house.

01:49:45.586 --> 01:49:46.747
- [JR] What ya'll doing at Maury house?

01:49:46.747 --> 01:49:48.582
- [Bre] What we always do.

01:49:48.582 --> 01:49:50.556
- Hey did you get that mail out the box?

01:49:50.556 --> 01:49:52.297
- [Bre] Yeah it's on your backpack.

01:49:52.297 --> 01:49:53.435
- [JR] Hey.

01:49:53.435 --> 01:49:54.503
- [Bre] Huh?

01:49:54.503 --> 01:49:55.455
- [JR] Be careful.

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.475
And answer your phone when I call you.

01:49:57.475 --> 01:49:58.808

01:50:28.565 --> 01:50:30.482
It's about to get dark.

01:50:31.787 --> 01:50:33.620
Ben, where you at man?

01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:38.223

Hurry up, dog.

01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:51.657

- That shit fire huh?

01:51:04.973 --> 01:51:06.528
- Man, I gave a couple
of packs to my main man.

01:51:06.528 --> 01:51:09.129
He's on his way back already.

01:51:09.129 --> 01:51:10.151
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:51:10.151 --> 01:51:11.484
- Getting it in.

01:51:13.611 --> 01:51:16.374

01:51:16.374 --> 01:51:19.648
- Fuck yeah, I can handle another line.

01:51:19.648 --> 01:51:23.731

01:51:24.779 --> 01:51:26.474
Let's get it.

01:51:26.474 --> 01:51:27.473
- 826.

01:51:27.473 --> 01:51:28.471
- 826.

01:51:28.471 --> 01:51:29.470
- 4826.

01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:30.840
- 4826.

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:31.885

01:51:31.885 --> 01:51:33.468
We're on a come up.

01:51:35.832 --> 01:51:39.153
- One of my young niggas was fucking up.

01:51:39.153 --> 01:51:40.986
So it's your blessing.

01:51:43.286 --> 01:51:45.677
You know what's so crazy.

01:51:45.677 --> 01:51:47.427
You remind me of him.

01:51:49.184 --> 01:51:51.767
Same blood type and everything.

01:51:54.037 --> 01:51:56.939
He was just a hustling motherfucker.

01:51:56.939 --> 01:51:59.439
He just knew how to get money.

01:52:02.651 --> 01:52:04.151
- Where he at now?

01:52:12.281 --> 01:52:16.345
- The nigga couldn't keep
his piece in his pants.

01:52:16.345 --> 01:52:20.640
So they put a piece to his
head, put his dick in the dirt.

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:21.890
Catch my drift.

01:52:30.277 --> 01:52:31.277
- It's cool.

01:52:38.145 --> 01:52:39.312

- [Renzo] It's all there?

01:53:24.675 --> 01:53:26.842
(gunshot)

01:53:36.488 --> 01:53:39.071
(somber music)
