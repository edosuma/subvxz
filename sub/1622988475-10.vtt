Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:06.528 --> 00:08.399
ALMA:
You killed all these people?

00:08.443 --> 00:09.879
I'm not spending one more night

00:09.922 --> 00:11.446
under the same roof with you

00:11.489 --> 00:13.535
and your collection
of murder souvenirs.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.363
-Sure you want to tell him?
-It's his baby.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.452
Well, what are you hoping for?

00:17.495 --> 00:19.410
Scooter is not ready
to be a father.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.021
VERN:
I plan to take good care

00:21.064 --> 00:22.283
of Dee and the baby.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.458
Well, you're
a private detective.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.373
It's dangerous work.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.244
Why is Mrs. Yost buried
in our garden?

00:27.288 --> 00:29.116
She tried to kill me,
and Bertie shoved her.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.814
She fell out the window right
on top of my gardening shears.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.294
No, please,
you can't tell anyone.

00:33.337 --> 00:34.556
You can't even tell Vern.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.558
Vern is my husband.

00:36.601 --> 00:37.733
He's also a detective.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.257
JOE:
Potassium chloride.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.911
That's a horrible way to die.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.304
I want to tell you
about this guy I met.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.870
All the evidence
he's uncovered--

00:44.914 --> 00:46.481
it's starting to point
to his girl's father.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.614
Sounds like your friend
has a decision to make.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.139
She's trying to take you
from me, like she did my papa.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.879
Catherine, please don't do this.

00:55.446 --> 00:56.360

01:13.638 --> 01:17.686
NARRATOR:
Vern Loomis was a righteous man,

01:17.729 --> 01:20.428
incapable of looking
the other way

01:20.471 --> 01:23.692
when confronted with evil.

01:23.735 --> 01:27.652
That is why he broke into
the Fillcot house that night.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.742
To learn, once and for all,

01:30.786 --> 01:33.528
if his father-in-law

01:33.571 --> 01:35.138
was a murderer.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.972
Hello, Mrs. Fillcot.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.495
We need to talk.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.592
Murder?

01:54.636 --> 01:56.681
You can't be serious.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.161
I am.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.207
Just because Carlo and Isabel

02:00.250 --> 02:02.513
died from drugs similar
to ones that Bertram uses...

02:02.557 --> 02:04.689
Not similar, identical.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.348
Why are you still
looking into this?

02:11.392 --> 02:12.784
Didn't Isabel confess?

02:12.828 --> 02:15.091
Isabel spoke to me
the day she died.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.920
She had proof someone else
was in the Castillo mansion

02:17.963 --> 02:19.530
the night Carlo was murdered.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.054
I think she was talking
about one of my photos.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.275
So you're not sure.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.625
When I went to her room,
she was already dead,

02:27.669 --> 02:29.323
and the photos were gone.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.716
My theory is the killer took it.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.589
-But you can't prove anything.
-No.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.113
All I got are questions.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.202
Like how could a maid
like Isabel

02:39.246 --> 02:41.161
get access to these drugs?

02:42.640 --> 02:45.121
You know what? I, um...

02:45.165 --> 02:46.166
Wait here.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.124
Back in a minute.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.448
Oh!

03:08.666 --> 03:10.886
So...

03:10.929 --> 03:13.497
A few weeks ago,
Bertram told me that some drugs

03:13.541 --> 03:16.065
had gone missing from his
medicine cabinet at work.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.023
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.156
"How odd," I thought.
"Who would have taken them?"

03:20.200 --> 03:22.811
And he told me that any of his
patients could have taken them

03:22.854 --> 03:24.291
while he was out of the room.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.118
But look
at his appointment book. Huh?

03:26.162 --> 03:27.642
See there?

03:27.685 --> 03:29.296
Isabel Duarte.

03:29.339 --> 03:33.169
She brought in Rita's cat
the day that Carlo was murdered.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.649
[sighs]

03:34.692 --> 03:37.434
You seem... agitated.

03:37.478 --> 03:40.089
I'm only trying to help you
find the truth.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.265
Why are you being contrary?

03:42.309 --> 03:45.007
Do you recall where your husband
was the night Mr. Castillo died?

03:45.050 --> 03:46.835
Oh, this is absurd.

03:46.878 --> 03:50.273
Why on earth
would Bertie want to kill Carlo?

03:50.317 --> 03:53.494
Well, Dee told me you hated Rita
for not letting you in her club.

03:53.537 --> 03:56.018
Once she went to jail,
didn't you get in?

03:56.061 --> 03:57.715
[sighs]

03:57.759 --> 04:01.328
Have you shared this silly
theory of yours with Dee?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.330
Because if she knew
that you were accusing

04:03.373 --> 04:05.288
her parents of murder...

04:05.332 --> 04:06.898
she'd never forgive you.

04:06.942 --> 04:09.597
Well, I see no reason
to talk to Dee about this.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.163
Not yet, anyway.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.950
Isabel killed Carlo.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.474
She confessed

04:17.518 --> 04:19.389
and then she killed herself.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.521
That's what happened.

04:21.609 --> 04:22.914
So let it go.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.046
Hmm?

04:25.221 --> 04:26.744
For me?

04:28.268 --> 04:33.055
When we first met, you suggested
I try a different occupation.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.057
I'm starting to realize why.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.756
My, it's late.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.456
We should both go to bed.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.419
NARRATOR:
Alma watched Vern exit,

04:49.463 --> 04:51.987
unaware he was a righteous man

04:52.030 --> 04:54.555
determined to confront evil

04:54.598 --> 04:56.774
no matter the cost.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.995
And Vern emerged from the house,

05:00.038 --> 05:02.302
unaware his mother-in-law

05:02.345 --> 05:05.305
had made
a very difficult decision.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.441
That her son-in-law

05:11.485 --> 05:14.139
needed to die.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.320
♪

05:40.470 --> 05:44.169
Alma Fillcot paced the floor
till morning,

05:44.213 --> 05:45.954
waiting for
her husband's return.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.827
She was desperate
to tell Bertram

05:49.871 --> 05:52.134
of their son-in-law's discovery.

05:53.135 --> 05:56.747
And hopeful he'd agree
to do what needed to be done.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.621
But of course...

06:00.664 --> 06:02.623
[phone ringing]

06:02.666 --> 06:04.842
...there was a complication.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.498
Hello?

06:09.586 --> 06:11.371
This is his wife.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.721
What?

06:15.113 --> 06:17.028
Which hospital?

06:18.465 --> 06:19.683
Hey.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.424
Did you sleep on the sofa?

06:21.468 --> 06:23.818
I got in late.
I didn't want to wake you.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.473
I'm going to the store
for eggs, but when I get back,

06:26.516 --> 06:28.518
there's some stuff
I need to talk to you about.

06:28.562 --> 06:32.479
Yeah, I got some stuff I need
to talk to you about, too.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.045
Okay.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.749
Mrs. Loomis.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.185
Detective Rohbin.

06:43.228 --> 06:44.882
What a nice surprise.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.494
Vern's upstairs taking a shower,
but if you can wait...

06:47.537 --> 06:49.017
Actually, I'm here to see you.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.627
Got a few questions for you.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.455
About the disappearance
of your neighbor.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.065
Mrs. Yost?

06:54.109 --> 06:55.676
Oh.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.419
You know, I don't think
there's much I can tell you.

06:59.462 --> 07:02.291
See, I think there is.

07:04.598 --> 07:07.078
I could drop by the station
later today.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.385
I'd prefer if you dropped by
right now.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.051
Hey there.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.270
Oh, it's you.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.099
I thought Catherine
had dropped by to finish me off.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.493
Oh, we won't be hearing
from her for a while.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.886
I stopped by the mansion

07:31.929 --> 07:33.888
to demand some hush money
for shooting you.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.280
She's flown the coop.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.108
And there are padlocks
on the doors.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.545
Mm.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.155
So, no more gracious living
for me, huh?

07:40.198 --> 07:41.852
I'm afraid not.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.812
Also...

07:44.855 --> 07:46.422
I've come to say goodbye.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.902
Goodbye?

07:47.945 --> 07:50.513
Well, everyone
in this town knows

07:50.557 --> 07:52.646
about my previous profession.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.300
I think it's time to bid adieu

07:55.344 --> 07:58.303
to this sunny cesspool and...

07:58.347 --> 07:59.522
head to New York.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.132
What will you do there?

08:01.176 --> 08:03.526
Perhaps I'll reinvent myself
again. [chuckles]

08:03.570 --> 08:06.224
I can be a Greek aristocrat
fleeing a loveless marriage.

08:07.225 --> 08:10.533
Millionaires can be
very generous

08:10.577 --> 08:12.796
to classy women
in dire circumstances.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.102
Well...

08:14.145 --> 08:16.191
I'll really miss you.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.541
Why not come with me?

08:20.587 --> 08:22.240
My career...

08:22.284 --> 08:24.678
I'm not the only one
tainted by scandal.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.768
People know you went from being
my lover to Catherine's.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.205
They're saying I was being kept?

08:30.248 --> 08:32.512
Word's gotten out, yes.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.906
Let's say I do go to New York.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.473
What do we do for money?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.736
We have that cash
you took from Catherine.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.523
And we'll pawn those diamond
cuff links she gave you.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.047
That'll be enough
to set us up in Manhattan.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.353
Oh, come on.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.442
Forget about showbiz
for a while.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.922
Let's have an adventure.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.798
I guess
I don't need to be an actor.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.756
As long as you're
my leading lady.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.671
Scooter...

09:01.715 --> 09:05.240
what a sweet
and clever thing to say.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.068
[chuckles]

09:07.111 --> 09:09.418
Mmm.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.551
Hey.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.117
Maybe I could be a writer.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.077
Don't ruin it.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.997
Mrs. Luna,
what can I do for you?

09:23.040 --> 09:26.000
I saw some detective
push your wife into a cop car

09:26.043 --> 09:27.088
and take her away.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.611
What did she do?

09:28.655 --> 09:29.699
Excuse me?

09:29.743 --> 09:31.179
I run a respectable building,

09:31.222 --> 09:33.311
and I don't rent
to no shady characters.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.878
Well, hold on.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.619
This detective...

09:36.663 --> 09:38.360
what did he look like?

09:38.403 --> 09:39.927
[indistinct conversation]

09:39.970 --> 09:42.190
-Dr. Andrews?
-Uh, yes?

09:42.233 --> 09:44.409
They said you were treating
my husband Bertram Fillcot,

09:44.453 --> 09:46.455
but they wouldn't tell me
what was wrong with him.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.631
Mr. Fillcot was shot.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.719
Shot!

09:49.763 --> 09:50.851
By who?

09:50.894 --> 09:51.895
Your husband's not sure.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.984
He thinks it was a stray bullet?

09:54.028 --> 09:55.551
Is Bertie all right?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.335
Oh, yeah, he's fine.
You know, luckily...

09:57.379 --> 09:59.555
his flask caught the slug.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.123
[chuckling]:
So he only suffered a few cuts

10:02.166 --> 10:04.255
when he fell backwards
into a plate glass window.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.866
Oh, my.

10:05.909 --> 10:08.085
You know, normally
I scold patients

10:08.129 --> 10:09.870
who knock back too much booze,

10:09.913 --> 10:13.656
but in this case your husband's
drinking problem...

10:13.700 --> 10:14.962
came in quite handy.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.093
[laughs]

10:19.662 --> 10:21.751
I guess, uh,
you'd like to see him now.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.535
I guess I would.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.454
Nurse,
this is Mr. Fillcot's wife.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.065
Oh, he's coming out of sedation.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.675
I'm not sure
he's able to talk yet.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.677
I just need a moment. Thank you.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.939
Thank you.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.466
Uh, if you could just
close the door.

10:42.424 --> 10:43.991
[chuckles]

10:44.034 --> 10:45.427
[panting]

10:45.470 --> 10:47.168
Bertram, wake up.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.212
-Wake up!
-Wh-What?!

10:48.256 --> 10:49.561
Why? What's happened?

10:49.605 --> 10:50.911
We're in trouble.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.129
Vern suspects
that we were involved

10:52.173 --> 10:53.783
in Carlo and Isabel's deaths.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.351
We have to stop him
before he goes to the police.

10:56.394 --> 10:57.700
And how do we do that?

10:58.745 --> 11:01.661
I think you know
what needs to be done.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.056
You mean kill him?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.667
But he's family.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.407
Only an in-law.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.061
But Dee loves him.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.584
Not after he turns us in.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.760
She'll be furious.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.891
She'll probably divorce him.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.588
So all things being equal...

11:16.632 --> 11:18.155
No.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.157
No, I won't hurt Vern.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.986
For God's sake,
we could get the chair.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.292
Is that what you want?

11:24.335 --> 11:25.989
I don't know.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.251
Let me sleep on it.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.339
Bertram, please.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.514
It's all falling apart.

11:29.558 --> 11:30.907
I don't know what to do.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.909
Dee knows about Mrs. Yost.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.651
We'd never get away with it.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.350
-Bertram?
-[snoring]

11:39.394 --> 11:40.787
Bertram!

11:40.830 --> 11:42.789
[huffing]

11:44.486 --> 11:47.532
NARRATOR: With Bertram's words
ringing in her ears,

11:47.576 --> 11:50.144
Alma's madness overtook her.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.841
She racked her brain,

11:51.885 --> 11:54.539
thinking of potential assassins.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.847
Someone willing to help
a housewife in need.

11:57.891 --> 12:00.284
But when she came up short...

12:00.328 --> 12:02.069
Nurse, excuse me.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.723
May I ask you a question?

12:03.766 --> 12:07.117
...fate stepped in
with a suggestion.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.598
When will the doctor
allow Scooter to leave?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.731
We're hoping to take a train
out to New York tonight.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.297
He should be discharged by 4:00.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.256
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.613
[footfalls approaching]

12:24.656 --> 12:26.615
-ALMA: Hmm.
-[door closes]

12:26.658 --> 12:28.225
Hello, Scooter.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.793
Uh, hi.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.926
I'm sorry. Have we met?

12:32.969 --> 12:34.754
No, but I feel like we have.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.799
I've heard so much about you
from my daughter.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.018
Dee Fillcot?

12:39.280 --> 12:40.542
You're Dee's mom?

12:40.585 --> 12:42.413
Oh, so you do remember her?

12:42.457 --> 12:44.589
That's encouraging, anyway.

12:45.590 --> 12:46.853
Well, how is she?

12:46.896 --> 12:49.246
She's pregnant,
that's how she is.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.640
And to answer
your next question,

12:51.683 --> 12:53.947
yes...

12:53.990 --> 12:55.775
it's yours.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.873
I feel a man has a right to know

13:06.916 --> 13:08.483
when he's going to be a daddy.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.964
Of course
I feel awful telling you this,

13:11.007 --> 13:13.705
while you're here
recovering from...

13:13.749 --> 13:15.185
what are you here for?

13:15.229 --> 13:16.752
I got shot.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.407
There's a lot of that
going around.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.889
Well, why didn't Dee
tell me about this?

13:22.932 --> 13:25.108
Well, Vern told her not to.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.545
Vern Loomis?

13:27.589 --> 13:28.895
The detective?

13:28.938 --> 13:31.854
He wanted to marry Dee,
and he did.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.291
[gasps] Did you not know that?

13:34.335 --> 13:35.902
No.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.425
Oh, no.

13:37.468 --> 13:40.602
I can only imagine
how upset you must be.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.909
Mostly I'm in shock.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.824
Now, don't be noble.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.565
Vern basically stole
your child.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.133
You're allowed to resent him.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.309
Hate him, even.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.008
I don't know how I feel.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.097
You're throwing
a lot at me here.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.489
I'm sorry.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.536
But at least you finally
know the truth.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.755
Anyway, I'll go.

14:03.799 --> 14:08.412
You just lie here
and try to control your rage.

14:08.456 --> 14:09.979
[chuckles]

14:20.033 --> 14:23.819
Look, if I knew anything about
Mrs. Yost, I would tell you.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.386
There is no if.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.779
We found your fingerprints
on all the valuables

14:27.823 --> 14:29.303
that went missing
from her house.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.000
Well, if you found them,

14:31.044 --> 14:32.567
that means they're not missing,
right?

14:32.610 --> 14:34.221
Don't get cute.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.744
They turned up in a closet

14:35.787 --> 14:37.702
Mrs. Yost's nephew
had already searched,

14:37.746 --> 14:41.097
after he told you
exactly what went missing.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.492
It's time to fess up, Dee.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.018
That's Mrs. Loomis to you.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.760
And I say
it's all just a big coincidence.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.895
Well, listen...

14:58.158 --> 14:59.899
I'm not suggesting

14:59.942 --> 15:02.205
you had anything to do
with Mrs. Yost's disappearance.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.512
Well, good, 'cause I didn't.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.906
But I do think you're covering
for someone.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.430
Like who?

15:10.518 --> 15:12.607
What size shoe does
your dad wear?

15:16.872 --> 15:18.656
It's okay.

15:19.875 --> 15:20.963
I'm sorry, Detective.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.747
I told him you were busy.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.836
That's all right, Sheila.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.664
How can I help you, buddy?

15:26.708 --> 15:28.666
You can let me
take my wife home.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.841
We're not done with her yet.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.321
We think she knows something

15:31.365 --> 15:33.149
about the disappearance
of one Carol Yost.

15:33.193 --> 15:36.718
I'm asking you as a friend.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.939
I got lots of friends.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.899
Well, how many of them carried
you on their back for a mile

15:43.943 --> 15:45.814
under enemy fire in Marseille?

15:45.857 --> 15:48.512
Yeah.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.601
I'm finally calling
that favor in.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.998
Come on. I got a job to do here.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.739
If she knows something...

15:57.782 --> 15:59.610
I know more than she does.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.743
Just give me a day.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.268
I'll bring you everything I got,
wrapped up in a bow.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.971
So what's the deal?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.668
Why does Rohbin think
you know something

16:13.711 --> 16:14.756
about that missing lady?

16:14.799 --> 16:16.323
'Cause I do.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.846
You want to clue me in?

16:17.889 --> 16:20.066
Sure, but prepare yourself.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.502
I'm gonna tell you stuff
about my parents

16:21.545 --> 16:23.808
that will shock you.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.508
I don't think
I'll be as shocked as you think.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.255
Alma?

16:36.256 --> 16:38.258
Mavis, what a lovely surprise.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.911
I'm so glad I ran into you.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.913
Ada Coy left the oddest message.

16:41.957 --> 16:44.264
She said that you had moved
up the Garden Club election?

16:44.307 --> 16:45.439
We're having it tonight?

16:45.482 --> 16:47.049
I'm running unopposed,

16:47.093 --> 16:48.964
so it's not like we need time
for campaigning.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.748
Most of the ladies
are available this evening,

16:50.792 --> 16:51.793
so I figured, "Why not"?

16:51.836 --> 16:52.837
Well, where will we meet?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.448
Chez Magnifique, 6:00 p.m.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.319
Jean-Luc is taking care
of everything.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.105
There's even going to be a cake
with garden-themed frosting.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.063
Oh, you're going to make
a wonderful president,

17:01.107 --> 17:03.109
with that eye you have
for details.

17:03.152 --> 17:06.112
I always say the key to success
is planning ahead.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.243
We'll see you tonight.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.853
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.048
BERTRAM:
A gun?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.441
You scared me.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.660
I scared you?

17:32.703 --> 17:34.618
Oh... I assumed you'd call me

17:34.662 --> 17:36.707
when you were released
from the hospital.

17:36.751 --> 17:37.926
Yes, I did.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.754
You were out shopping.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.364
Don't act so shocked.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.019
We discussed the Vern situation
at the hospital.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.934
No, you discussed it.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.110
I laid there in a stupor,
hoping I was hallucinating.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.198
Relax.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.547
I've got it all planned out,

17:50.591 --> 17:52.636
and I can handle it myself
tonight.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.203
Tonight?

17:54.247 --> 17:55.596
You're going to shoot
our son-in-law tonight?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.337
It's the only way
my plan will work.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.295
Come see what else I bought.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.297
Hmm.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.908
Alma, this is madness.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.649
Dee found a body in our garden.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.738
If Vern gets shot,
who's she going to blame?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.785
Scooter Polarsky.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.482
[giggling]

18:18.880 --> 18:20.925
Who is Scooter Polarsky?

18:20.969 --> 18:22.623
The father of Dee's baby.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.886
I saw him at the hospital,
told him Dee was pregnant,

18:24.929 --> 18:26.757
and stole one of his cuff links.

18:26.801 --> 18:29.020
Now, should I wear
the red or the gold?

18:29.064 --> 18:31.719
You told him about the baby?
But-but-but why?

18:31.762 --> 18:34.461
So he'd have a motive.
[chuckles]

18:34.504 --> 18:37.420
I'll call Dee tonight, tell her
that I've torn a stocking

18:37.464 --> 18:39.944
and I need her to bring
a new pair to the restaurant.

18:39.988 --> 18:43.644
While she's buying them,
I'll ring their doorbell,

18:43.687 --> 18:46.255
shoot Vern, and then leave
by the fire escape,

18:46.299 --> 18:48.649
dropping one of Scooter's
cuff links by the window.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.999
Scooter and Rita are leaving
for New York at 9:00.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.958
So the police will just think
that he's run away. [chuckles]

18:55.003 --> 18:57.745
Now, how should I wear my hair?

18:57.788 --> 18:59.877
With that stole,
an updo might be nice,

18:59.921 --> 19:01.096
with the right earrings.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.228
No.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.490
I should wear it down?

19:03.533 --> 19:05.883
-I can't let you do this.
-Let me?

19:05.927 --> 19:07.320
[scoffs]

19:07.363 --> 19:09.365
I'm not asking permission.

19:09.409 --> 19:10.845
It's too risky.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.282
The only real risk
is doing nothing.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.066
Bertram...

19:15.110 --> 19:16.590
I like Vern, too.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.200
I do, but...

19:18.244 --> 19:21.290
[sighs] He must be dealt with.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.775
Then let me do it.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.255
What?

19:29.298 --> 19:31.300
I'm the one
that put you in danger.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.476
I should be the one to save you.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.782
Save me?

19:34.825 --> 19:37.001
It's all my fault, all of it.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.352
What happened to us.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.702
What you've done.

19:41.745 --> 19:42.964
What you've become.

19:43.007 --> 19:46.315
I don't regret what I've become.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.491
No, I regret what I was.

19:48.535 --> 19:51.146
A timid little nobody.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.148
Too afraid to ask
for attention or power

19:53.192 --> 19:54.889
or anything else worth having.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.847
But that woman is dead.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.763
Now, when I want something,
I take it.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.549
When I have a problem,
I fix it by myself,

20:02.592 --> 20:04.246
without help from you
or anyone else.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.596
And let me tell you...

20:06.640 --> 20:08.424
it feels damn good.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.517
Alma.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.737
All I want is your happiness.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.522
Let me prove it to you
by dealing with Vern.

20:22.308 --> 20:26.050
Also, it's your, your big night
tonight, isn't it?

20:26.094 --> 20:27.835
You want to enjoy it?

20:27.878 --> 20:29.532
Think what all that shooting
and escaping

20:29.576 --> 20:30.664
will do to your hair.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.016
That is a good point.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.541
Very well.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.197
You may save me.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.332
[giggles]

20:56.298 --> 20:58.387
I can't believe
that bitch told you.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.302
Today, of all days?

21:00.346 --> 21:02.739
I can't believe you knew I had
a kid and didn't say a word.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.002
Where are you going?

21:05.046 --> 21:06.177
Where do you think?

21:06.221 --> 21:07.570
I'm going to find Dee.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.006
How long will that take?

21:09.050 --> 21:10.530
The train for New York
leaves at 9:00.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.227
I'm not sure I want to go now.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.317
Scooter, we just made plans.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.492
Dee's having my kid.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.233
And I got to do right by her.

21:19.452 --> 21:20.757
But she doesn't need you.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.413
She's married to the detective.

21:24.457 --> 21:27.634
Well, maybe my kid needs me.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.509
Scooter.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.946
You're right.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.906
Of course you have to think
about the child.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.952
Thank you for understanding.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.912
After you talk to Dee,

21:44.955 --> 21:48.655
can you just meet me
at O'Dwyer's Tavern around 6:00?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.396
To let me know the score?

21:51.397 --> 21:53.007
Maybe.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.710
Geez, Rita.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.670
I really wish you had told me
about the baby.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.548
It's not possible.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.245
Honey, think about it.

22:14.289 --> 22:17.597
They had the means to kill Carlo
and a motive.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.120
The same for Isabel.

22:19.163 --> 22:22.079
Getting into a garden club
is not a motive.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.212
It's insane.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.301
My parents are good people.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.564
Tell that to the corpse
under their birdbath.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.000
They explained that.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.133
To your satisfaction,
not to mine,

22:32.176 --> 22:33.613
and not to Rohbin's.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.789
Well, you, you can't tell him
any of this.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.094
Are you asking me
to look the other way?

22:37.138 --> 22:38.182
Is that what you want?

22:38.226 --> 22:40.663
They're my parents.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.449
Okay. Okay.

22:43.492 --> 22:46.321
Let's say
I keep my theories to myself.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.063
But Rohbin still thinks
you're involved.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.847
He's got your fingerprints
on her stuff.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.502
-He's not going to let that go.
-But I didn't do anything wrong.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.156
Until you tell him
what you know,

22:55.199 --> 22:56.984
you're an accessory
after the fact

22:57.027 --> 22:58.942
to whatever your parents did.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.857
[gasps]

23:00.901 --> 23:02.859
Do you want our baby
born in jail?

23:04.034 --> 23:05.340
No.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.603
Then let's go back
to the station.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.040
We tell Rohbin what we know,

23:10.084 --> 23:12.434
and we let the chips fall
where they may.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.917
No.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.659
Dee.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.791
I just got to think
about this, okay?

23:21.835 --> 23:23.010
I just...

23:23.053 --> 23:24.577
I got to figure this out.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.411
[sighs]

23:37.590 --> 23:39.374
Scooter.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.984
What are you doing here?

23:41.028 --> 23:43.334
I need to talk to you.
You got a sec?

23:43.378 --> 23:46.033
Now is really not a good time.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.556
I know about our baby.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.214
Ah, geez.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.050
Rita.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.835
Oh.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.968
Hello, Grace.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.448
Taking a trip?

24:10.449 --> 24:11.754
Yeah.

24:13.321 --> 24:16.193
You and your friends in the
coven had me banished. Remember?

24:16.237 --> 24:17.934
Oh, Rita.

24:19.806 --> 24:23.592
The way the club turned on you
was disgraceful.

24:23.636 --> 24:26.726
And I didn't say a word
in your defense.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.555
But I have come to know

24:29.598 --> 24:32.122
what betrayal feels like and,

24:32.166 --> 24:34.385
well, I'm truly sorry.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.170
Thank you.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.521
That means more
than you can imagine.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.349
Oh.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.482
And, for what it's worth,
I've just left the club, too.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.266
Really?

24:45.309 --> 24:46.528
Why?

24:46.572 --> 24:49.139
Lots of reasons.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.881
But mostly
I can't stand the idea

24:51.925 --> 24:54.710
of sitting through
Alma's inauguration tonight.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.843
Alma is the new president?

24:56.886 --> 24:58.627
How is that possible?

24:58.671 --> 25:01.412
Here's what I've come to learn
about Alma Fillcot:

25:01.456 --> 25:03.763
she is a sweet-talking vampire,

25:03.806 --> 25:05.634
and if she'd fought
for the Nazis,

25:05.678 --> 25:08.071
we'd all be speaking German.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.551
I thought you liked her.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.031
What changed?

25:11.074 --> 25:12.815
I got in her way.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.948
Found out how ruthless she is.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.471
Ruthless?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.994
Alma?

25:18.995 --> 25:20.475
Why are you surprised?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.172
You crossed her.
Look what happened to you.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.871
What are you talking about?

25:24.914 --> 25:27.613
No one benefited
from you going to jail

25:27.656 --> 25:29.049
more than Alma.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.756
How would you like to talk...

25:40.800 --> 25:42.279
over lunch?

25:44.717 --> 25:45.848
[phone ringing]

25:46.893 --> 25:48.808
-Hello?
-BERTRAM: Hello.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.071
-Oh, Mr. Fillcot.
-I hear you had

25:51.114 --> 25:52.507
a rather interesting
conversation

25:52.551 --> 25:53.769
with my wife last night.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.336
We did.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.425
And if you have questions
for me, you can just ask.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.383
There's no need
to break into my home.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.255
Yeah, sorry about that.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.909
I'm at my clinic, working late.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.693
And if you can drop by
in the next hour or so,

26:04.737 --> 26:06.695
I'll be happy to answer
any questions you may have.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.524
Okay, Mr. Fillcot.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.917
We'll see you then.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.535
You could have at least
given me the chance

26:20.579 --> 26:21.797
to do the right thing.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.930
You have big dreams, Scooter.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.496
I didn't want to be the gal

26:25.540 --> 26:27.281
who kept you
from being a movie star.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.675
Well, that's not looking likely.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.328
Well, don't give up.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.287
Hollywood needs
handsome guys like you.

26:34.984 --> 26:37.421
Actually, I was thinking
about going to New York.

26:39.467 --> 26:42.513
But if you need me to be here,
to help with the baby.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.820
No. No.

26:44.864 --> 26:46.953
Vern and I got it covered.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.220
Hey, um...

26:54.700 --> 26:56.571
When the kid gets older,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.051
will you tell him about me?

26:58.094 --> 27:01.358
Sure. Sure.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.884
So, you think it'll be a boy?

27:06.494 --> 27:07.930
Yeah.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.672
And if I do make it,

27:10.716 --> 27:12.674
tell him I'll buy him
whatever he wants.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.459
I'm hoping you gave him
your good looks.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.157
That would be gift enough.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.204
Be better for him
if he looks like an average Joe.

27:21.248 --> 27:24.381
That way, he won't expect
so much from the world.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.385
Small dreams.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.347
[sighs] That's the way to go.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.310
Listen, I got to go.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.618
I'm dealing
with a big family thing. So...

27:44.750 --> 27:47.143
Oh, sure. Uh...

27:48.275 --> 27:50.712
Well, thank you
for hearing me out.

27:50.756 --> 27:53.323
And thank your mom
for me as well.

27:54.324 --> 27:55.978
My mom?

27:56.022 --> 27:59.155
Yeah. She's the one
who told me about the baby.

28:05.379 --> 28:06.902
Mom?

28:06.946 --> 28:09.035
Are you here?

28:09.078 --> 28:11.385
We need to talk!

28:12.473 --> 28:14.257
-Mom.
-Deirdra?

28:17.304 --> 28:18.566
Ah.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.133
What a nice surprise.

28:20.176 --> 28:22.875
Have you come to see me off
for my big night?

28:25.486 --> 28:27.749
I spoke to Scooter.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.056
Why did you tell him
I was pregnant?

28:31.405 --> 28:33.407
You spoke to Scooter?

28:33.450 --> 28:35.670
I thought he was still
in the hospital.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.802
They released him.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.368
Can we talk about this later?

28:38.412 --> 28:40.675
I'm late for my inauguration.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.111
There's something else.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.505
Shoot.
I've misplaced my lipstick.

28:44.548 --> 28:46.899
If you could just help me
look for it...

28:47.900 --> 28:49.728
I've also spoken to Vern.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.035
He's been working for Rita,

28:53.079 --> 28:55.777
trying to prove she was framed
for Carlo's death.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.040
He shared his theory with me...

28:58.084 --> 29:00.303
about who the real killers are.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.610
Well... did he also tell you

29:02.653 --> 29:04.612
that he broke into our home
last night?

29:04.655 --> 29:06.396
I caught him in the act.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.095
Then he tried to change the
subject by hurling all sorts

29:09.138 --> 29:11.097
of vile lies at me.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.794
So I threw him out.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.622
Obviously, Vern was livid.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.451
So you can't believe
a word he says.

29:20.628 --> 29:24.066
Vern tried to convince me
you and Daddy are involved,

29:24.110 --> 29:26.242
but I refused to believe him.

29:26.286 --> 29:28.114
Of course you did.

29:28.157 --> 29:31.204
I told him you and Daddy
were good people,

29:31.247 --> 29:32.771
incapable of murder.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.033
Exactly.

29:34.990 --> 29:38.167
Now, if I could just find
that lipstick.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.865
Oh. [chuckles]

29:39.908 --> 29:42.041
But that brings me
back to Scooter.

29:42.084 --> 29:44.086
Why tell him I was pregnant?

29:46.045 --> 29:49.396
Scooter said you expected him
to be angry at the news.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.573
I just keep thinking,

29:52.616 --> 29:55.402
if you thought he'd be angry,
why tell him?

29:55.445 --> 29:57.970
Did you hope
he'd become violent

29:58.013 --> 30:00.276
and hurt Vern?

30:00.320 --> 30:01.974
Oh, but you couldn't want that.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.628
Unless...

30:06.065 --> 30:08.415
Vern had uncovered the truth.

30:13.507 --> 30:16.553
You haven't said a thing
about the way I look.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.037
What?

30:22.081 --> 30:23.865
All of the work
that I've put in

30:23.909 --> 30:26.868
on my hair and my nails.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.348
My clothes.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.523
It's all come together.

30:29.566 --> 30:32.831
Surely, you must have noticed.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.573
Mom.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.403
What are you doing?

30:40.447 --> 30:42.536
I think...

30:42.579 --> 30:45.713
when a woman's come as far
as I have, that...

30:47.846 --> 30:50.500
...well, it's a sin
not to tell her she's beautiful.

31:06.647 --> 31:07.735
Hello?

31:14.307 --> 31:16.744
Mr. Fillcot.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.239
Ah.

31:33.282 --> 31:34.283
Vern.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.676
Thanks for coming.

31:35.719 --> 31:38.113
You're admiring my collection,
I see.

31:38.157 --> 31:41.508
I had to rescue that
from a garbage can.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.336
Been hiding it here ever since.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.859
Must be valuable.

31:44.903 --> 31:45.991
Only to me.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.731
[chuckles] In fact,

31:47.775 --> 31:49.559
this silly, little box

31:49.603 --> 31:51.518
is the reason we're both
here tonight.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.784
You don't understand.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.179
But you will.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.051
So...

32:03.095 --> 32:05.053
Dee told me about Mrs. Yost.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.881
Yes.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.665
I thought she might have.

32:08.709 --> 32:09.971
Good for her. Hmm.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.233
Would you like a drink?

32:11.277 --> 32:13.453
I think we could both use one.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.628
Yes.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.944
Hey.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.641
I'm wondering
if my lady friend is here.

32:27.684 --> 32:28.990
Her name is Rita.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.383
She's supposed to be
waiting for me.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.341
Uh, I don't think
she's here, buddy.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.908
Can I get you something
in the meantime?

32:33.952 --> 32:36.389
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me get a, uh...

32:39.131 --> 32:40.654
Uh...

32:40.697 --> 32:43.048
Actually, I'll just wait
till she gets here.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.315
[crowd clamoring]

33:04.895 --> 33:06.462
Ladies.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.812
-Ah.
-Alma, you're a vision.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.597
Oh, I love that stole.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.208
Well, I thought the occasion
called for a little glamour.

33:13.252 --> 33:14.905
[chuckles]
So what's the program tonight?

33:14.949 --> 33:16.429
When do I speak?

33:16.472 --> 33:19.040
First, we let everyone get
nicely snockered.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.390
And then I give
an endless speech,

33:21.434 --> 33:22.696
thanking everyone
who did anything

33:22.739 --> 33:23.827
for the club
for the entire year,

33:23.871 --> 33:25.481
And then I say,

33:25.525 --> 33:27.875
"And now,
for the woman of the hour..."

33:28.963 --> 33:30.269
Good Lord.

33:30.312 --> 33:31.792
Is that Rita?

33:35.274 --> 33:37.450
What is she doing here?

33:38.886 --> 33:40.453
Mrs. Fillcot?

33:40.496 --> 33:42.368
-A moment.
-Yes?

33:42.411 --> 33:45.588
That woman outside
asked me to give this to you.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.025
Thank you, Maximilian.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.992
You want to tell me
about your girlfriend?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.428
The one in your garden?

33:59.472 --> 34:01.126
[sighs]

34:01.169 --> 34:02.823
Carol Yost
was not my girlfriend.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.651
I have never cheated on my wife.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.740
But your wife told Dee...

34:06.783 --> 34:08.437
She lied.

34:08.481 --> 34:11.527
That's all she's been doing
for the last two months.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.964
Just telling one lie
after another.

34:15.009 --> 34:16.228
And for nothing.

34:16.271 --> 34:17.881
I'm confused.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.014
What exactly has Mrs. Fillcot
been lying about?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.624
Mm...

34:21.668 --> 34:24.062
She wouldn't want me
to tell you.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.891
She'd want me
to spin one more lie.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.982
Just you and me, all alone,

34:32.026 --> 34:34.333
far as I know.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.726
Tell me what's going on.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.163
Yes.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.121
We are all alone.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.734
First, I must apologize.

34:44.778 --> 34:47.694
Please know that
this is not easy for me.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.053
Hello?

35:02.448 --> 35:04.363
Thank you for seeing me.

35:04.406 --> 35:05.973
Will this take long?

35:06.016 --> 35:08.193
My inauguration
is about to begin.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.151
I know.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.501
I should start by saying

35:12.545 --> 35:14.982
congratulations,
Madam President.

35:15.025 --> 35:16.810
What a meteoric rise.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.857
I do not miss your sarcasm.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.208
Go on.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.211
Ask your question.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.301
Did you kill Carlo?

35:31.216 --> 35:32.434
I beg your pardon?

35:34.393 --> 35:37.178
You did, didn't you?

35:37.222 --> 35:41.443
And you put that syringe
in my purse to frame me.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.229
Why didn't I see it?

35:44.272 --> 35:46.753
I thought about Isabel,
who at least had a reason.

35:46.796 --> 35:50.800
I thought about Catherine and
Carlo's business rivals, but...

35:50.844 --> 35:54.326
not once did I think about you.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.110
Of course not.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.809
Women like you always
underestimate women like me.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.813
Wallflowers.

36:04.814 --> 36:07.687
Plain, unpopular girls.

36:09.645 --> 36:13.083
You don't know what it's like
to trudge through life

36:13.127 --> 36:15.608
begging women like you

36:15.651 --> 36:17.610
to please, just...

36:17.653 --> 36:19.786
look at me.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.225
I admired you so much.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.923
I wanted so badly
to be your friend.

36:29.883 --> 36:32.233
If you hadn't been cruel, I...

36:32.277 --> 36:33.669
You what?

36:34.670 --> 36:36.106
Finish that sentence.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.804
No.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.372
I have to go.

36:40.415 --> 36:43.375
You wouldn't have killed
my husband?

36:43.418 --> 36:46.769
Let go of me,
or I'll have you arrested.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.858
Come on, Alma, confess.

36:48.902 --> 36:51.034
You'll feel so much better.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.994
God, I wish
you were still in jail.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.476
If the police hadn't found
that damn postcard

36:57.519 --> 36:58.825
letting you off the hook.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.219
Postcard?

37:03.438 --> 37:05.397
Yes, the maid's confession.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.401
Don't look at me like that.

37:09.444 --> 37:10.924
It was in all the papers.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.621
The papers...

37:14.580 --> 37:16.756
...said she left a note.

37:16.799 --> 37:19.498
None of them said
it was on a postcard.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.327
You murdered Isabel, too.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.806
Now, hold on.

37:23.850 --> 37:24.633
I knew she wouldn't
have killed herself.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.635
I... I knew it.

37:26.679 --> 37:29.421
Whatever it is you think
you know,

37:29.464 --> 37:31.858
you can't prove anything.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.294
Perhaps not.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.038
But I can certainly
make some noise.

37:38.081 --> 37:40.693
No, you are not going in there.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.521
Good point.

37:42.564 --> 37:45.959
News like this deserves to come
in through the front door.

to Sonia Clark

38:15.510 --> 38:19.601
for organizing this year's
lecture series on exotic blooms.

38:19.645 --> 38:21.255
[giggling]

38:24.911 --> 38:27.174
Oh! And now...

38:27.217 --> 38:29.655
the moment we have all
been waiting for.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.221
Ladies and gentleman,

38:31.265 --> 38:34.790
It is my honor to introduce
a terrific lady

38:34.834 --> 38:36.531
who just happens to be

38:36.575 --> 38:39.142
our brand-new president.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.406
Alma Fillcot!

38:52.895 --> 38:53.983
Thank you.

38:55.115 --> 38:57.160
Thank you all so much.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.338
We have seen some dark days.

My predecessor in this job

and brazen deceptions

But where she brought
our reputation low...

39:19.835 --> 39:24.100
...together...
we will raise it high.

Hear, hear.

Is that blood?

39:34.676 --> 39:37.244
Oh, no, that-that's, um...

39:37.287 --> 39:38.637
Someone call the cops.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.421
There's a dead woman
in the alley.

-What?
-What's happening?

40:08.231 --> 40:10.016
I know she comes here a lot.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.539
Have you seen her?

40:38.914 --> 40:40.612
Bertie?

40:45.138 --> 40:46.835
Bertie?

40:49.272 --> 40:50.665
Where are you?

40:53.668 --> 40:54.713
Hello, my love.

40:54.756 --> 40:57.019
What is all this?

40:57.977 --> 41:00.153
I took the blame for all of it.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.894
For every death.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.940
And I told Vern
you were innocent of any crime.

41:04.984 --> 41:07.900
I even gave him your gun
as a show of good faith.

41:07.943 --> 41:10.250
He's still alive?

41:11.512 --> 41:13.732
-You said...
-I said I'd save you.

41:13.775 --> 41:15.864
And I did.

41:15.908 --> 41:18.301
If you had killed him,
you'd have been caught.

41:18.345 --> 41:21.043
And, well,
Dee loves him so much.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.829
All we've ever wanted
is for her to be happy.

41:23.872 --> 41:25.526
So...

41:28.094 --> 41:30.531
I also asked Vern to give me

41:30.575 --> 41:33.795
some time to say goodbye to you
before he phones the police.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.884
Goodbye?

41:37.146 --> 41:39.105
I've decided to help myself.

41:39.148 --> 41:40.802
Like I helped so many others.

41:41.803 --> 41:44.502
That way, you'll be spared
the pain of a trial.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.463
Darling.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.378
Why is there blood
on your stole?

41:51.421 --> 41:52.466

41:54.599 --> 41:56.339
I just killed Rita.

Alma.

She figured it all out.

She was going to tell.

42:02.345 --> 42:04.609
I can't keep up with you.

You're always a bloody murder
ahead of me.

What am I going to do?

42:08.613 --> 42:10.179
The police are going to come.

42:10.223 --> 42:11.964
I can't go to jail.

42:16.316 --> 42:18.187
Perhaps
you'd like to come with me?

42:19.188 --> 42:23.323
Soon, people will learn
our most sordid secrets,

42:23.366 --> 42:24.803
and they'll hate us.

is still ours.

We don't have to do this.

43:27.692 --> 43:29.128
What?

43:30.216 --> 43:32.784
We're giving up too easily.

43:32.827 --> 43:35.482
I can say that,
that Rita threatened me

43:35.525 --> 43:37.397
and I was just defending myself.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.791
She can't contradict me
now that she's dead.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.619
But, darling...

43:41.662 --> 43:42.924
I can handle the police.

43:42.968 --> 43:44.926
I'll think of some kind
of story.

late for that.
