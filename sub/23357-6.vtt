WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.118
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...<i>
- Old guy I was</i>

00:02.128 --> 00:04.482
<i>playing golf with has
developed a bit of a tremor.</i>

00:04.492 --> 00:06.961
Cracking open his head for a
missed putt is a bit much?

00:06.971 --> 00:08.886
I hear you're applying for an O1 visa.

00:08.896 --> 00:10.688
If I help you, you'll get your visa.

00:10.705 --> 00:11.855
If I don't, you won't.

00:11.865 --> 00:13.657
Tell me about your Mom.
Or Dad. You pick.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.193
- Dad? Well, I hate him.
- Why?

00:16.204 --> 00:18.696
Because he's the last guy
anyone would want as a father.

00:18.706 --> 00:19.898
<i>Alabama Shakes</i>

00:19.908 --> 00:21.365
playing Terminal West next week.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.334
I got an extra ticket. It's not a date.

00:23.344 --> 00:25.380
<i>It's just a concert. Have a little fun.</i>

00:29.631 --> 00:31.186
You look good, son.

01:18.063 --> 01:20.199
Give me the bag, Doc.

01:33.348 --> 01:34.465
Great.

01:41.098 --> 01:42.680
I need some help.

01:42.690 --> 01:44.401
I take his head, you take his legs?

01:45.012 --> 01:47.017
18yearold male,
unconscious, broken nose,

01:47.027 --> 01:49.287
blunt force trauma to the head,
possible concussion.

01:49.297 --> 01:51.756
Three's open. Dr. Okafor.

01:51.766 --> 01:53.791
- You're bleeding.
- I'm fine. He's not.

01:53.801 --> 01:55.959
His name's Atiba Johnson, maybe Jackson,

01:55.969 --> 01:58.139
- something like that.
- What happened to him?

01:59.172 --> 02:00.776
I did.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.282
You know, the key to success

02:19.292 --> 02:21.285
in a business like this

02:21.295 --> 02:23.720
is making the customers
feel like family.

02:23.730 --> 02:26.124
But this place goes a little overboard.

02:26.134 --> 02:28.328
Sam, how are those eggs coming along?

02:28.339 --> 02:29.626
You look well.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.872
Atlanta suits you.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.743
Why are you here, Dad?

02:37.722 --> 02:41.526
I'm looking for worthwhile
investment opportunities.

02:43.028 --> 02:45.287
It's been over a decade
since we last spoke,

02:45.297 --> 02:48.122
and you suddenly show up...
what's the real reason?

02:48.132 --> 02:50.903
You were always suspicious.

02:52.843 --> 02:55.363
And you were always a narcissist.

02:55.374 --> 02:57.899
I was hoping that time

02:57.909 --> 03:01.246
and maturity would open
the doors for us starting over.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.906
Dada! Dada!

03:04.916 --> 03:07.609
Clearly, you don't know me very well.

03:07.619 --> 03:09.378
Then again, you never did.

03:09.388 --> 03:12.281
I was just... another thing
you could use to hurt Mom.

03:12.291 --> 03:14.616
So fighting for the custody of my son

03:14.626 --> 03:17.551
- makes me the bad guy?
- You didn't <i> want</i> me.

03:17.561 --> 03:20.055
- You just didn't want to lose.
- Here we go again.

03:30.007 --> 03:31.932
And so that's it?

03:31.942 --> 03:34.635
- My time's up?
- I meant what I said

03:34.645 --> 03:37.139
when I left for the Corps.

03:37.149 --> 03:40.987
I don't want you
or your money in my life.

03:42.953 --> 03:45.080
You know, I've done a lot of research

03:45.090 --> 03:47.481
on the health care industry.

03:48.147 --> 03:49.950
You know what's fascinating?

03:50.376 --> 03:54.337
You worked so hard
to distance yourself from me

03:54.347 --> 03:56.907
and... what is it you used to call it?

03:56.917 --> 03:59.663
- Greed and...
- Questionable ethics.

04:00.354 --> 04:02.538
Look at the industry you work in.

04:02.549 --> 04:04.374
I help sick people.

04:04.385 --> 04:06.030
And while I'm at it, I fight corruption

04:06.041 --> 04:07.952
and train doctors to do the same.

04:07.971 --> 04:11.531
I don't capitalize
off of people's misfortune.

04:11.932 --> 04:14.241
That's the difference between us.

04:27.232 --> 04:29.788
Are you sure you don't want even
a little local to numb it up?

04:29.799 --> 04:32.436
- Some ibuprofen? Something?
- What for?

04:34.999 --> 04:36.350
Atiba's scans?

04:36.361 --> 04:37.936
Look clear. He's a lucky guy.

04:37.947 --> 04:39.517
No fractures, no contusions.

04:39.528 --> 04:41.689
He's still under observation
for a possible concussion,

04:41.700 --> 04:43.756
but as soon as that time's up, we
can turn him over to the cops.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.103
No cops.

04:45.114 --> 04:47.704
- The guy tried to mug you.
- He wasn't even holding a real gun.

04:47.715 --> 04:50.142
- Turns out it was a toy.
- Doesn't negate the mugging part.

04:50.153 --> 04:52.400
- Who got mugged?
- No one. -Mina.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.332
It's not a big deal. Just some kid

04:55.342 --> 04:56.978
from my neighborhood
made a stupid choice

04:56.989 --> 04:58.697
- while high this morning.
- And for that,

04:58.708 --> 05:00.467
he got knocked the hell out!

05:03.658 --> 05:05.383
I give that a "C" for effort.

05:05.393 --> 05:07.119
Look, I vaguely know his parents.

05:07.129 --> 05:08.554
They live in my neighborhood.

05:08.564 --> 05:10.855
This is a boy who needs help, not jail.

05:10.865 --> 05:14.636
- And you're gonna help him?
- I did. I brought him here.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.534
Cheese and grits
from the Silver Skillet.

05:22.544 --> 05:24.302
Down, boy.

05:24.312 --> 05:26.237
This deliciousness is for someone else.

05:26.247 --> 05:28.140
Well, I'm happy with the lab work

05:28.150 --> 05:29.842
that came back, which means

05:29.852 --> 05:32.744
you are finally cleared
for your bone marrow transplant.

05:32.754 --> 05:34.412
We can start your conditioning today.

05:34.422 --> 05:35.914
Dr. Pravesh?

05:35.924 --> 05:39.016
Yeah, so first you'll receive a series

05:39.026 --> 05:41.419
of BuFlu chemo blasts to ensure

05:41.429 --> 05:43.422
that all the bone marrow is cleared out.

05:43.432 --> 05:45.224
And then we can perform an allogeneic

05:45.234 --> 05:47.893
hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

05:47.903 --> 05:50.328
Wow. You know, when
you break it down like that,

05:50.338 --> 05:52.330
it seems so simple.

05:52.340 --> 05:55.768
Why don't you try that again,
but this time not in Latin.

05:55.778 --> 05:57.535
Okay. Sorry.

05:57.545 --> 06:00.438
So, basically, we're going
to take donor stem cells

06:00.448 --> 06:02.708
and have them set up shop
in your bone marrow

06:02.718 --> 06:04.109
and populate your immune system.

06:04.119 --> 06:05.576
Right. Once that's done,

06:05.586 --> 06:07.546
your new and improved immune system

06:07.556 --> 06:10.249
will recognize
any remaining leukemia cells

06:10.259 --> 06:12.395
as foreign, and attack them.

06:15.431 --> 06:17.188
Go ahead and take that.

06:17.198 --> 06:19.569
I can finish up in here.

06:20.735 --> 06:22.628
Hey. Why'd you page me?

06:22.638 --> 06:25.097
Hey. I need you to keep an eye
on Lily for me.

06:25.107 --> 06:26.765
I was taken off her team.

06:26.775 --> 06:29.034
Yeah, I heard about that, Nic.
Waitwaitwaitwait.

06:29.044 --> 06:30.413
What's going on?

06:32.213 --> 06:34.884
All right, come on.

06:39.254 --> 06:40.479
Close the door.

06:41.622 --> 06:43.080
Is all this really necessary?

06:43.090 --> 06:45.717
I think Lane's committing
insurance fraud

06:45.727 --> 06:49.054
by overtreating her patients...
including Lily.

06:49.064 --> 06:50.888
Look, Nic,

06:50.898 --> 06:53.958
Lane is the most respected
oncologist in Georgia,

06:53.968 --> 06:56.462
not to mention someone
whose work I have admired

06:56.472 --> 06:58.263
and studied since med school.

06:58.273 --> 06:59.965
Look, I have pulled every ounce

06:59.975 --> 07:01.934
of research that I can possibly find

07:01.944 --> 07:03.501
on highdose intensification programs

07:03.511 --> 07:05.671
both here and abroad... look at this.

07:05.681 --> 07:08.006
These are from Lane's clinic.

07:08.016 --> 07:09.941
Her chemo protocols
are significantly higher

07:09.951 --> 07:12.821
than even the most aggressive programs.

07:16.758 --> 07:19.251
Did you tell Conrad?

07:19.261 --> 07:21.119
I tried.

07:21.129 --> 07:23.955
But if I'm gonna accuse his
mentor of something so awful,

07:23.965 --> 07:25.924
I need more proof.

07:25.934 --> 07:27.926
Nic...

07:27.936 --> 07:30.761
do you think, maybe,

07:30.771 --> 07:35.100
you are letting
your personal feelings for Lane

07:35.110 --> 07:37.679
cloud your judgment?

07:39.814 --> 07:42.451
It's no secret
that you two don't get along.

07:43.977 --> 07:46.210
No. I'm doing my job...

07:46.220 --> 07:48.881
a job that Lane threatened,
by the way... so you

07:48.891 --> 07:50.616
just keep an eye on Lily.

07:50.626 --> 07:52.828
You're her doctor... that's <i> your</i> job.

08:03.476 --> 08:06.163
Do you know how much longer
Doc Davenport is gonna be?

08:06.174 --> 08:08.165
I really need to get back to rehearsal.

08:08.175 --> 08:10.167
Nigel, I'm Dr. Hawkins.

08:10.177 --> 08:12.348
Dr. Davenport asked me to stop by.

08:14.583 --> 08:15.741
Look, let me save you

08:15.751 --> 08:18.376
a long trip down an unnecessary road.

08:18.386 --> 08:20.712
Yes, I'm showing signs
of severe malnourishment,

08:20.722 --> 08:22.647
and no, I don't have an eating disorder.

08:22.657 --> 08:25.150
I suffer from chronic digestive pain,

08:25.160 --> 08:27.486
and it makes it
almost impossible to eat.

08:27.496 --> 08:30.255
It's been over a decade,
and no, none of my doctors

08:30.265 --> 08:32.924
back in New York
seem to know what it is.

08:32.933 --> 08:35.760
So before you ask, the answer is no.

08:35.770 --> 08:38.230
No more tests. Zero.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.732
I've been poked and prodded
by every doctor imaginable.

08:40.741 --> 08:42.900
The only doctor I haven't seen
is a gynecologist.

08:42.909 --> 08:44.236
They're overrated.

08:46.213 --> 08:48.539
I've accepted I'm
just gonna live with this pain

08:48.549 --> 08:50.375
for the rest of my life.

08:50.385 --> 08:52.376
I'm a ballet dancer...
I'm used to intense pain.

08:52.386 --> 08:55.179
- That's no way to live, man.
- I've made my peace.

08:55.189 --> 08:57.716
Only thing that matters now
is my career.

08:57.726 --> 09:00.017
So can I just get some steroids
for my ankle,

09:00.027 --> 09:02.054
- so I can get back to my show?
- Look...

09:02.452 --> 09:03.688
I get it.

09:03.698 --> 09:06.558
I get how important
your career is to you, okay?

09:06.568 --> 09:10.028
If you leave, you'll be
right back with another injury.

09:10.038 --> 09:12.463
Maybe a day, a week, or even a month,

09:12.473 --> 09:14.193
but it will happen.

09:14.204 --> 09:15.967
Your twisted ankle's just the beginning.

09:15.977 --> 09:17.969
You're malnourished,
and your body can't handle

09:17.979 --> 09:19.972
the stress of being
a professional dancer anymore.

09:19.982 --> 09:22.640
- So I should just give up?
- Give me 24 hours, and let me

09:22.650 --> 09:24.642
see if I can figure out
what's wrong with you.

09:24.652 --> 09:26.745
It's worth it if I can save your career.

09:26.755 --> 09:28.391
Right?

09:37.598 --> 09:39.390
You found me.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.059
- Wasn't lookin' for you.
- Ouch.

09:41.069 --> 09:42.740
Didn't you get the cheese and grits?

09:42.751 --> 09:45.084
They say the way to a woman's
heart is through her stomach.

09:45.095 --> 09:47.665
Actually, I think that's the way
to a man's heart, but thanks,

09:47.675 --> 09:50.284
- Irving loved them.
- You gave away my gift?

09:50.295 --> 09:52.206
"Gift" is a strong word.
This is more like

09:52.217 --> 09:54.760
you passed a bush, saw a flower
sticking out, plucked it for me,

09:54.771 --> 09:56.859
and then said, "Hey, look...
I bought you flowers."

09:56.870 --> 10:00.411
- Wow. Tough crowd. Okay.
- Have you seen Mina?

10:00.421 --> 10:02.581
I heard she took on a gang
of muggers last night.

10:02.591 --> 10:04.315
It's all anyone's
talking about upstairs.

10:04.325 --> 10:07.519
I need some help in here! Now!

10:07.529 --> 10:10.685
- Damn it, Atiba, calm down!
- Easy, buddy, easy!

10:10.696 --> 10:13.759
- He's going through withdrawal.
- He tried to take a chunk out of me!

10:13.769 --> 10:14.860
Give me two of lorazepam.

10:14.870 --> 10:16.661
Code Gray! Bed three!

10:16.671 --> 10:18.139
Okay.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.991
Okay.

10:30.069 --> 10:31.170
How's Atiba?

10:31.181 --> 10:33.227
Calmer. Drowsy. Restrained.

10:33.238 --> 10:35.741
- You need to call his parents.
- Me? Why me?

10:35.752 --> 10:38.677
Because someone needs to tell
them to come pick up their son.

10:38.844 --> 10:40.848
I don't do people.

10:43.069 --> 10:44.878
I thought you were still on vacation.

10:44.889 --> 10:47.271
My sisterinlaw's in town.

10:47.282 --> 10:49.039
Not a fan?

10:49.421 --> 10:51.481
- Want to grab a coffee?
- Sure.

10:51.491 --> 10:54.450
Be happy you don't have inlaws anymore.
I am.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.819
By the way, that golf buddy of mine,

10:56.829 --> 11:00.490
- the one with the tremor...
- Right. How's he doing?

11:00.500 --> 11:02.424
Well, he's had to lay off the benzos.

11:02.434 --> 11:04.260
The side effects
were too aggressive for him.

11:04.270 --> 11:06.997
And now he's all wound up about
the tremor returning, and...

11:07.639 --> 11:10.000
Well, he's right to be concerned.

11:10.010 --> 11:12.678
If the tremor is really interfering
with his quality of life,

11:12.689 --> 11:15.038
your friend may ultimately
have to consider brain surgery.

11:15.048 --> 11:17.339
And we both know
when the air hits your brain...

11:17.349 --> 11:18.851
You're never the same.

11:22.731 --> 11:27.621
No, this is... this is a hospital,
Mr. Jackson, not a hotel. No.

11:27.632 --> 11:29.957
No, we don't have courtesy shuttles.

11:30.295 --> 11:32.840
Well, you'll just have
to come get Atiba.

11:34.074 --> 11:35.231
Hello?

11:36.002 --> 11:37.193
Hello?

11:37.574 --> 11:39.462
Are you kidding me?

11:39.472 --> 11:42.481
- You okay?
- Nothing a little caffeine

11:42.492 --> 11:44.627
can't fix.

11:46.512 --> 11:49.785
It's been a long shift
that is thankfully almost over.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.434
Well, maybe this

11:51.445 --> 11:52.715
will help your mood, too.

11:52.726 --> 11:54.977
My God. I didn't even
realize it had fallen off.

11:54.988 --> 11:57.785
Lara found it on the floor
of the nurses' lounge.

11:57.796 --> 12:00.332
I'm simply doing the honor
of returning it.

12:02.728 --> 12:03.987
There you go.

12:03.997 --> 12:05.655
I see you wear it all the time.

12:05.665 --> 12:08.916
- Figured it's one of your favorites.
- Well, thank you. I owe you one.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.525
Really?

12:10.536 --> 12:12.707
Get over yourself. I'll see you later.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.684
Hey, Conrad!

12:15.507 --> 12:17.426
Whatever it is, figure it out.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.203
No can do. I need reinforcements.

12:27.192 --> 12:29.483
The priority is to get
to the source of your pain,

12:29.493 --> 12:31.515
be it psychological, neurological...

12:31.526 --> 12:33.954
- This is not in my head.
- This is a GI problem.

12:33.964 --> 12:35.659
We'll need to do a battery of tests,

12:35.670 --> 12:37.662
starting with a colonoscopy
and upper endoscopy...

12:37.673 --> 12:39.687
That's fine, but after I get
nerve condition studies.

12:39.698 --> 12:41.962
- This is neuropathic.
- Has anyone ruled out <i> H. Pylori?</i>

12:41.972 --> 12:43.802
- This is a GI problem.
- This is neuropathic.

12:43.813 --> 12:45.366
It's psychological.

12:45.376 --> 12:46.901
Battery of tests.

12:49.081 --> 12:50.539
What's going on? I didn't ask

12:50.549 --> 12:51.972
for any consults on this patient.

12:51.982 --> 12:53.574
Our attending did.

12:53.584 --> 12:55.477
We can't rule out
biliary dyskinesia, either,

12:55.487 --> 12:57.578
until we do a CCKHIDA scan.

12:57.588 --> 12:59.845
- Gen surg isn't even here.
- Look who finally showed up.

12:59.856 --> 13:01.382
Nigel, I'm sorry. Give me one second.

13:01.392 --> 13:02.927
Can I talk to you, Dr. Wilmot?

13:08.699 --> 13:11.659
You're not usually on the floor
post rounds.

13:11.669 --> 13:13.634
I don't have to account
for my whereabouts.

13:13.645 --> 13:16.398
I'm your attending. You report
to me, not the other way around.

13:16.408 --> 13:18.433
- You requested consults on my patient.
- Yeah.

13:18.443 --> 13:21.035
- Why?
- I think the question is why didn't you?

13:21.045 --> 13:24.172
He's already had every test
you're coming up with in there.

13:24.182 --> 13:27.061
Not at Chastain. We run our own tests.

13:27.072 --> 13:30.578
Nigel is sick of doctors.
He's been poked and prodded for years.

13:30.588 --> 13:31.830
I'm just giving him a breather

13:31.841 --> 13:33.955
while all his medical records
are sent from New York.

13:33.966 --> 13:35.983
And meanwhile, he sits around
in constant pain?

13:35.994 --> 13:39.053
Pain that can be exacerbated
by unnecessary procedures.

13:39.063 --> 13:41.622
See, this has always been
your problem, Hawkins.

13:41.632 --> 13:43.792
You think your way is the only way.

13:43.802 --> 13:46.428
Look, I... I just want to go
over his previous test results

13:46.438 --> 13:48.102
before subjecting him to new ones.

13:48.113 --> 13:49.698
Well, look, it's not your call anymore

13:49.708 --> 13:51.933
because he's no longer your patient.
He's mine now.

13:51.943 --> 13:53.645
Thank you.

14:01.930 --> 14:03.577
How you feeling?

14:03.587 --> 14:05.780
I'm just gonna check your pupils, okay?

14:06.930 --> 14:08.784
Doc, are these restraints necessary?

14:08.794 --> 14:10.651
I'm cool now. For real.

14:10.661 --> 14:12.953
I'm actually a nurse
practitioner, not a doctor.

14:12.963 --> 14:15.390
And yes, they are.
They're for your own protection.

14:16.164 --> 14:18.567
So, I guess the cops are coming?

14:18.578 --> 14:20.343
Well, looks like it's your lucky day.

14:20.354 --> 14:23.157
Dr. Okafor decided not to press charges.

14:25.054 --> 14:28.180
I haven't exactly had
a lot of lucky days lately.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.140
- I called your parents.
- Why?

14:32.150 --> 14:33.782
They don't want nothing to do with me.

14:33.793 --> 14:35.394
Because someone has to come and get you.

14:35.405 --> 14:37.710
If y'all for real not calling the cops,
then just release me.

14:37.721 --> 14:40.120
On your own? So you can go back out
onto the street and score again?

14:40.131 --> 14:43.019
I don't think so. Plus, you have
lorazepam in your system. You could OD.

14:43.030 --> 14:44.251
No. Seriously...

14:44.261 --> 14:46.788
after everything that happened today,

14:46.798 --> 14:47.956
I'm done with that mess.

14:47.966 --> 14:49.591
I'ma get clean.

14:49.601 --> 14:51.626
I've heard that before.

14:51.636 --> 14:54.196
Why you care so much about me anyway?

14:54.206 --> 14:57.866
Is there anyone else
who can come pick you up?

14:57.876 --> 14:59.134
Nah.

14:59.144 --> 15:00.980
I got no one.

15:03.948 --> 15:06.718
So what happens to me now?

15:17.294 --> 15:19.298
What are you doing?

15:20.298 --> 15:22.057
Taking Atiba home.

15:22.067 --> 15:25.059
I asked you to call his parents,
not turn into his personal taxi.

15:25.069 --> 15:28.129
His parents aren't coming to get him,
so I'm going to take him to them.

15:28.139 --> 15:30.201
Have you lost your mind?

15:30.490 --> 15:32.132
Y'all know I'm standing
right here, right?

15:32.142 --> 15:33.668
Be quiet. You tried to mug me.

15:33.678 --> 15:35.035
You don't get to say anything.

15:35.045 --> 15:37.805
I'm sorry. Thisthis morning
I wasn't thinking st...

15:37.815 --> 15:39.341
I'ma stop talking now.

15:39.351 --> 15:41.159
Look, my shift is over.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.206
I'm giving him a ride.
It's not a big deal.

15:43.217 --> 15:45.491
Damn <i> oyibo</i> savior complex.

15:48.154 --> 15:51.519
Someone has to protect you
from yourself... and him.

15:51.529 --> 15:52.887
Plus, he's my patient.

15:52.897 --> 15:54.856
So, you're stuck with both of us now.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.475
That's fine by me.

15:58.577 --> 16:00.047
Get your ass in the back seat.

16:12.217 --> 16:14.208
It's quite a view, isn't it?

16:14.218 --> 16:17.111
Never fails to impress. You rang?

16:17.121 --> 16:19.880
Yeah, about an hour ago.

16:19.890 --> 16:21.448
I was in surgery.

16:21.458 --> 16:24.685
Mr. Levine's
parathyroidectomy. How was that?

16:24.695 --> 16:28.222
A success. I think you'll find
him very indebted to Chastain.

16:28.232 --> 16:30.725
I had the scheduling nurse
clear your afternoon.

16:30.735 --> 16:34.228
I ran into Dr. Edmund Carver
from St. Grace

16:34.238 --> 16:36.298
last night at the opera.

16:36.308 --> 16:37.731
He's in town briefly,

16:37.741 --> 16:39.400
and I invited him here for coffee today.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.824
And you'd like me to attend that coffee.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.940
Every reputable hospital in the country
is trying to recruit Carver

16:45.950 --> 16:48.409
after his surgery
on the former attorney general.

16:48.419 --> 16:51.146
I want Carver at Chastain.

16:51.156 --> 16:52.813
I hear he's overrated.

16:52.823 --> 16:54.215
Maybe.

16:54.225 --> 16:55.917
But with your guidance,

16:55.927 --> 16:59.720
he would be an incredible asset
to your team.

16:59.730 --> 17:01.255
You just talk to him.

17:01.265 --> 17:04.124
Show him around, give him the full Bell.

17:04.134 --> 17:06.069
Close that deal for me.

17:07.863 --> 17:09.563
Consider it closed.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.810
Thank you.

17:21.002 --> 17:22.509
So, who are we mad at today?

17:22.519 --> 17:23.611
Other than that pen.

17:23.621 --> 17:24.945
How much time do you have?

17:24.955 --> 17:27.144
Anything I can help with?

17:28.121 --> 17:30.125
I convinced a patient
with unknown chronic pain

17:30.136 --> 17:32.195
to stay and let me try
and help him, but then...

17:32.206 --> 17:33.953
Word gets out, and the vultures descend.

17:33.964 --> 17:36.617
Yep. I'll give you two guesses.
Who was the leader of the pack?

17:36.628 --> 17:39.127
Sampson in Neuro.
He can never resist a call

17:39.137 --> 17:41.595
for a mystery diagnosis.
Allows him to bill

17:41.605 --> 17:43.797
- a ton for testing.
- He was there.

17:43.807 --> 17:46.055
But today's prize goes to Wilmot.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.134
Took over the case.

17:47.144 --> 17:50.386
Wants to ensure if we figure out
the diagnosis, he gets the win.

17:51.181 --> 17:53.775
You sure it's just Wilmot
that's bothering you?

17:53.785 --> 17:56.111
Hey. You're a hard man to find.

17:56.121 --> 17:58.846
- Well, you found me.
- Wilmot asked me to consult

17:58.856 --> 18:01.448
on a possible lap chole
for Nigel Meahan.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.985
You and Wilmot
want to unnecessarily remove

18:03.995 --> 18:05.786
a man's gallbladder without even knowing

18:05.796 --> 18:07.155
if that's the source of his pain?

18:07.876 --> 18:11.503
Well, for the record, I told him it
was premature to consider surgery.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.113
So, has he been biting everyone's
head off today, or just mine?

18:20.124 --> 18:21.468
Depends.

18:21.478 --> 18:23.280
What'd you do?

18:24.960 --> 18:26.199
<i>You know, you really didn't</i>

18:26.210 --> 18:28.487
have to escort me
to my conditioning personally.

18:28.498 --> 18:31.012
Well, don't tell me
you're sick of me already.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.814
You know, once my immune
system is stripped,

18:33.824 --> 18:37.685
just how isolated am I gonna have to be?

18:37.695 --> 18:40.421
Are we talking no contact? Or...

18:40.431 --> 18:42.900
- It's for your safety, Lily.
- No, I know.

18:45.061 --> 18:46.593
That's stupid, right?

18:47.032 --> 18:50.003
You'd think I'd be used
to being alone by now.

18:55.731 --> 18:57.839
I thought we were headed
to conditioning.

18:57.849 --> 18:59.852
We have time.

19:01.997 --> 19:03.458
Talk to me, Lily.

19:04.919 --> 19:06.924
What's really going on?

19:08.927 --> 19:11.341
Well, this is the right thing
for me, right?

19:12.239 --> 19:13.932
The bone marrow transplant?

19:15.880 --> 19:18.892
I've been doing some reading,
and once we start,

19:18.902 --> 19:21.372
there's no turning back.

19:23.373 --> 19:26.066
You're scared. I get it.

19:26.661 --> 19:30.071
- But that'sthat's totally normal.
- I know.

19:30.081 --> 19:33.819
I have a 62% survival rate
in my first year.

19:35.053 --> 19:38.545
That's a 38% chance of dying.

19:38.555 --> 19:41.548
But no doctor has ever
just come out and said that.

19:41.558 --> 19:43.418
Besides, there's...

19:43.428 --> 19:45.486
there's other complications. I mean...

19:45.496 --> 19:47.956
it could damage my organs. Infertility.

19:47.966 --> 19:50.239
I want to have kids one day, and...

19:51.138 --> 19:53.628
God.

19:53.638 --> 19:55.864
Listen to me.

19:56.338 --> 19:58.174
Selfpity is so attractive.

20:01.270 --> 20:03.430
You know what? Ignore me.

20:03.448 --> 20:05.939
Bone marrow transplants save lives.

20:05.949 --> 20:08.476
I need a transplant, so I'm
going to get a transplant.

20:08.486 --> 20:10.789
End of story.

20:18.702 --> 20:19.786
I understand, but...

20:19.796 --> 20:22.351
I don't care what my husband
told y'all on the phone.

20:22.362 --> 20:24.791
Atiba is not welcome back in our lives.

20:24.802 --> 20:26.928
It's not safe for him
to be out on the streets.

20:26.938 --> 20:28.295
He could OD at any time.

20:28.305 --> 20:31.198
- Monique, if he's trying to get clea...
- Do I look like a fool?

20:31.208 --> 20:33.601
I'm done helping him.

20:33.611 --> 20:35.203
That is not the boy I raised.

20:35.213 --> 20:37.713
I know how difficult it is

20:37.724 --> 20:39.439
to watch someone you love
suffer through a disease

20:39.450 --> 20:41.168
- like this...
- Really, missy?

20:41.179 --> 20:42.810
Do you have kids?

20:43.616 --> 20:46.980
Do you know what it's like to come
to work and find your store robbed

20:46.990 --> 20:49.984
and then realize that your boy did it
for drug money?

20:50.569 --> 20:54.054
Or to come home and find
your baby alone in a soiled diaper,

20:54.064 --> 20:55.857
crying for hours

20:55.867 --> 20:57.958
because his brother's passed out
in the bathroom?

20:57.968 --> 21:00.168
You're trying to protect
what's left of your family.

21:00.179 --> 21:01.696
I do understand that.

21:01.706 --> 21:03.630
But I also know you still love your son.

21:04.405 --> 21:07.735
What if he really is
willing to get help?

21:07.745 --> 21:10.237
He can beat this.

21:10.247 --> 21:12.806
Monique.

21:12.816 --> 21:14.542
Come on. Just hear him out.

21:14.552 --> 21:16.355
Come on.

21:18.132 --> 21:19.991
I'm for real this time, Mom.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.061
Please.

21:26.944 --> 21:28.566
I'll go in a program.

21:28.577 --> 21:30.358
I swear.

21:30.905 --> 21:33.038
I'll do whatever you say.

21:37.757 --> 21:39.343
Ma!

21:44.748 --> 21:47.007
That boy won't be able to stay clean.

21:47.017 --> 21:48.543
He hasn't hit rock bottom yet.

21:48.553 --> 21:50.111
Yeah, well, you can't give up hope,

21:50.121 --> 21:53.247
'cause while you're waiting for
rock bottom, you could end up dead.

21:53.257 --> 21:54.948
So, who is it?

21:54.958 --> 21:57.919
The way you're talking
only comes from experience.

21:57.929 --> 21:59.687
So who is it?

22:00.189 --> 22:01.733
My sister.

22:06.804 --> 22:09.030
Hey. I need a full panel
on Lily Kendall.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.033
Her most recent labs are in her file.

22:12.043 --> 22:15.385
Thank you, but I'd still like
to have a full panel done.

22:15.396 --> 22:16.716
You've worked here long enough

22:16.727 --> 22:18.605
that I shouldn't have
to explain this to you.

22:18.615 --> 22:20.975
Dr. Hunter handles all
of her patient labs through

22:20.986 --> 22:23.738
her clinic, and they've already
done a full panel on Lily.

22:23.749 --> 22:26.948
Isabel, you've worked here long
enough to know that I am the doctor,

22:26.958 --> 22:28.749
you are the nurse.

22:28.759 --> 22:31.355
So you can run a new damn panel on Lily

22:31.366 --> 22:33.287
or I can take it up
with your supervisor.

22:33.297 --> 22:35.890
Green and purple top coming up...

22:35.900 --> 22:37.557
Doctor.

22:44.381 --> 22:47.134
He's seizing.
What's the first thing you do, Pravesh?

22:47.144 --> 22:49.070
Let's get some access.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.604
All right. Lorazepam.

22:50.614 --> 22:52.704
Four milligrams. Go. Soon as possible,

22:52.715 --> 22:54.561
- get him on the monitor.
- What happened here?

22:54.572 --> 22:57.512
Last I saw him, he was drinking
his colonoscopy prep solution.

22:57.522 --> 22:59.246
Where's Dr. Wilmot?

22:59.256 --> 23:01.293
Let me guess, you paged him...
no response.

23:14.787 --> 23:16.778
Dr. Carver.

23:16.789 --> 23:18.693
Dr. Bell.

23:18.704 --> 23:19.896
It is an honor.

23:19.907 --> 23:22.233
Randy, please. The pleasure's all mine.

23:22.244 --> 23:23.407
Welcome to my hospital.

23:23.418 --> 23:24.675
This is one hell of a hospital.

23:24.686 --> 23:26.128
Well, you haven't seen anything yet.

23:26.139 --> 23:27.854
How 'bout a personal tour before coffee?

23:27.865 --> 23:29.896
Does that tour include
a sneak peak at the Titian?

23:29.907 --> 23:31.842
'Cause I am dying
to get my hands on one of them.

23:31.853 --> 23:34.264
Well, as long as you promise
to share how you were able to do

23:34.275 --> 23:36.623
a Kasai procedure in under four hours.

23:36.634 --> 23:39.287
Dr. Carver. Wow, such an honor.

23:39.298 --> 23:41.435
- If I may, one question...
- Nownow is not the time.

23:41.446 --> 23:43.221
No, no. It's okay.
What's your question, son?

23:43.232 --> 23:45.322
Your retrospective study
on risk factors for...

23:45.333 --> 23:47.450
How do you keep
your retransplantation rate

23:47.460 --> 23:50.286
- under 20%? -It's actually been 22%...
- This is not the time

23:50.296 --> 23:52.121
or place for any kind of confrontation.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.957
I need to talk to Dr. Wilmot.
Whether or not

23:53.967 --> 23:55.926
there's a confrontation
or not is up to him.

23:55.936 --> 23:58.427
- Just... let me handle it.
- Dr. Wilmot.

23:59.273 --> 24:01.998
I don't know what kind of drama
you got going on with Conrad,

24:02.008 --> 24:05.601
but get it the hell away
from Carver and me right now.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.919
Yes, sir.

24:07.514 --> 24:11.151
That's the first thing, and
the most important. Keep that in mind.

24:14.169 --> 24:15.224
Hey.

24:15.235 --> 24:18.193
I don't appreciate you embarrassing me
in front of Dr. Bell.

24:18.204 --> 24:20.817
You took anatomy class
in med school, right?

24:20.827 --> 24:22.946
Vestigial organs...

24:22.957 --> 24:25.360
- What are you rambling about?
- You know, like the appendix.

24:25.371 --> 24:27.824
The one in 20 people who have it
removed don't even miss it.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.828
Serves absolutely no purpose
in the human body anymore.

24:30.839 --> 24:33.438
Like certain doctors here at Chastain.

24:33.449 --> 24:36.265
You really think
you're untouchable, don't you?

24:36.275 --> 24:39.078
What I think is you gave
an already malnourished patient

24:39.089 --> 24:42.383
a prep solution that exacerbated
his existing hyponatremia.

24:42.394 --> 24:44.942
And when he started seizing,
you were nowhere to be found.

24:44.953 --> 24:47.117
- He's stable now, isn't he?
- Thanks to my intern.

24:47.128 --> 24:48.836
Good. Get an NG tube in there.

24:48.847 --> 24:50.664
We should be able
to get the solution straight

24:50.675 --> 24:52.610
into the digestive system that way.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.817
You want to put Nigel through

24:54.827 --> 24:56.652
a nasogastric tube insertion
just for a test?

24:56.662 --> 24:59.133
If it means getting to the root
of his pain sooner than later,

24:59.144 --> 25:00.656
then, yes, I do.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.930
Look, I'm trying to help the patient.

25:02.941 --> 25:05.377
Then why don't you try
actually listening to him?

25:15.983 --> 25:18.438
You did a good thing
getting Atiba to his family.

25:18.449 --> 25:20.401
At least he's safe for one night.

25:20.697 --> 25:22.235
I'm sorry I judged you.

25:22.756 --> 25:24.375
I didn't realize you judged me.

25:24.386 --> 25:26.008
It was all in my inner monologue.

25:26.226 --> 25:27.719
Good to know.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.653
I would've wanted someone
to do the same for my sister.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.223
There were many nights
she didn't make it home.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.407
But she's been sober for a year now.

25:37.180 --> 25:39.929
So, you're sleeping with Jude now?

25:39.939 --> 25:42.265
What? Why would you say that?

25:42.275 --> 25:44.313
I'm really good
at reading body language.

25:44.324 --> 25:47.102
I mean, look, the guy's
attractive and he's nice...

25:47.113 --> 25:49.860
And safe, compared
to someone else we know.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.076
Look, Jude and I are
just becoming better friends.

25:54.086 --> 25:57.360
All right. So I guess that means
I can become "better friends"

25:57.371 --> 25:59.664
with Conrad now, right?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.578
I was joking.

26:06.344 --> 26:08.461
II'm sorry. I'm still running late.

26:08.472 --> 26:10.664
What? Where are you?

26:10.675 --> 26:12.852
I'll be there in less than ten minutes.

26:13.610 --> 26:15.932
I need you to drop me
at my place, right away.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.383
Yeah, sure.

26:22.339 --> 26:24.110
What are you doing?

26:25.118 --> 26:28.422
Wilmot ordered me to put
an NG tube in Nigel.

26:28.433 --> 26:30.103
What a surprise.

26:31.565 --> 26:33.547
He could have us both
cut from the program.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.735
Man up. Where's all that bravado

26:35.746 --> 26:37.242
you had on independence day?

26:37.253 --> 26:38.956
What happened to "When someone's wrong",

26:38.966 --> 26:40.668
I'll be the first one to tell 'em"?

26:42.399 --> 26:43.547
Well...

26:44.181 --> 26:46.817
I'm not so sure Wilmot's wrong.

26:48.946 --> 26:51.649
Get out of my way.

26:53.547 --> 26:55.321
Let me have it. I deserve it.

26:55.332 --> 26:57.352
When you asked for 24 hours,
I didn't realize

26:57.363 --> 26:59.563
it would put me closer
to planning my own funeral.

26:59.574 --> 27:03.189
You said you could help me. Now I'm
worse off than when I came in.

27:07.857 --> 27:09.006
What are you doing?

27:09.017 --> 27:12.092
You're right. I should have done
a better job protecting you.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.532
Do you trust me?

27:22.692 --> 27:23.923
Yes.

27:24.281 --> 27:25.493
God knows why.

27:25.504 --> 27:27.006
Put your clothes on.

27:30.337 --> 27:32.439
Do I want to know what you're doing?

27:32.450 --> 27:35.314
Wilmot can't test a patient
he can't find.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.563
- Mina, what's going on?
- Thanks for the ride.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.079
I'm so sorry. We tried
to wait for you at home.

27:49.090 --> 27:51.015
No, it's my fault. I was delayed.

27:51.026 --> 27:53.673
She won't stop throwing up.
It's never been this bad.

27:53.684 --> 27:55.861
These episodes
can recur multiple times a year.

27:55.872 --> 27:58.025
- Any abdominal pain?
- Yes. A lot.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.073
Here you go. Here you go, baby.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.887
- Tell me the pain, one to ten.
- Ten.

28:10.590 --> 28:12.851
You followed me?

28:12.862 --> 28:14.792
That call sounded urgent.
I thought I could help.

28:14.803 --> 28:17.353
- Mina, what is going on in here?
- Do you have any pain in your head?

28:17.363 --> 28:18.554
Just my stomach.

28:18.564 --> 28:21.219
I need one tablet of ondansetron.
Bottom drawer to the right.

28:21.230 --> 28:23.622
And one liter bag of IV fluid
from my backpack.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.015
Are you just going to stand
there or are you going to help?

28:32.131 --> 28:33.790
Mina, are these from Chastain?

28:43.283 --> 28:46.853
Okay, so this is one test I haven't had.

28:47.908 --> 28:50.337
But, seriously, what are we doing here?

28:50.348 --> 28:54.082
I'm hiding you where no doctor
will voluntarily show their face.

28:54.093 --> 28:56.087
A hospital waiting room?

28:57.330 --> 28:58.353
That is brilliant.

28:58.364 --> 29:01.236
And a damn sad commentary
on my profession.

29:01.247 --> 29:03.384
So, what's the plan beyond hiding?

29:03.395 --> 29:04.620
I'm gonna listen.

29:05.205 --> 29:08.197
I've reviewed
all your old medical records.

29:08.207 --> 29:11.635
Now I want your patient history
directly from you.

29:11.645 --> 29:14.369
Doesn't matter how small
the detail... bore me with it.

29:14.380 --> 29:16.884
You went to all this trouble
and all we're gonna do is talk?

29:16.895 --> 29:19.122
Patient's words over tests.

29:19.133 --> 29:22.345
90% of the time, they give you
the answers you need.

29:24.946 --> 29:27.537
Maybe.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.387
I have to say,
you're not what I expected.

29:30.397 --> 29:34.619
- Yeah? What'd you expect?
- Frankly, less warmth, more ego.

29:35.002 --> 29:36.493
Well...

29:36.503 --> 29:38.494
Your surgeons are lucky
to have you as chief.

29:38.504 --> 29:40.759
- I hope they appreciate you.
- Well, yyou're very kind.

29:40.770 --> 29:43.361
But I can tell you what they
do appreciate is the autonomy

29:43.372 --> 29:45.168
and the extensive OR time.

29:45.178 --> 29:47.853
And, you know, for the best of the best,

29:47.864 --> 29:49.839
just a membership to the Blackburn Club.

29:49.850 --> 29:51.251
Wow.

29:51.262 --> 29:53.103
A lot of benefits
to working here at Chastain.

29:53.114 --> 29:56.478
- It's a great place to be.
- Well... I'm curious.

29:56.955 --> 30:00.119
How are your surgical error
and complication rates?

30:01.093 --> 30:02.181
Excuse me?

30:02.192 --> 30:04.431
Well, I'm leaving St. Grace
for a bunch of reasons,

30:04.442 --> 30:06.936
and, to be honest,
accountability's a big one.

30:07.353 --> 30:09.548
They refused to even consider
my recommendations

30:09.559 --> 30:12.697
for tracking surgical error
rates, among other things.

30:13.126 --> 30:15.430
Well, soso what you're looking for

30:15.441 --> 30:17.102
is a place that's willing
to embrace that.

30:17.113 --> 30:19.835
Transparency and accountability
force us to weed out the bad

30:19.845 --> 30:21.050
and grow the good.

30:22.370 --> 30:25.409
This one doctor at St. Grace
had patients die

30:25.420 --> 30:27.738
from complications
every time he did a bypass.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.667
No one even noticed.

30:30.466 --> 30:32.441
Except me. I noticed.

30:34.050 --> 30:35.878
That's incredible.

30:36.597 --> 30:38.777
I'm telling you,
it's like they say, you know,

30:38.788 --> 30:41.092
the truth never gets out of the OR.

30:58.451 --> 31:00.863
Well, you are just full of surprises.

31:01.887 --> 31:03.409
How's Shalisha?

31:03.420 --> 31:05.312
Cyclical vomiting syndrome.

31:05.323 --> 31:08.050
She'll be fine once she finishes
her IV treatment.

31:08.061 --> 31:09.652
- Mina...
- Save me the lecture.

31:09.663 --> 31:10.988
I can't.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.667
You're treating patients from your home.

31:12.678 --> 31:14.472
You're taking supplies from Chastain.

31:14.483 --> 31:16.409
Those drugs are all free samples
from reps.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.347
Free samples given to Chastain.
Regardless, you could lose

31:19.358 --> 31:21.831
your medical license for
treating people in your home.

31:21.842 --> 31:23.550
Hell, Mina, you could lose your visa.

31:23.561 --> 31:25.054
I'm not a fool. I know that.

31:25.472 --> 31:27.097
But am I supposed to look the other way

31:27.108 --> 31:30.071
while people in my community are
dying from treatable illnesses?

31:30.082 --> 31:31.941
So send them to a clinic.

31:31.951 --> 31:33.370
What clinic?

31:33.722 --> 31:35.948
All the big hospitals
are closing their local clinics

31:35.959 --> 31:37.714
left and right for profit reasons.

31:37.725 --> 31:39.722
And it's not fair.
But if you lose your license,

31:39.733 --> 31:42.566
you're not gonna help anybody. Ever.

31:49.636 --> 31:52.901
My uncle, Onoche,

31:53.638 --> 31:55.830
he was a brilliant man.

31:55.841 --> 31:57.934
Like a second father to me.

31:57.944 --> 32:01.303
He was a surgeon here
in the U.S., and...

32:01.313 --> 32:02.847
when he'd visit Nigeria on holiday,

32:02.858 --> 32:05.684
he'd bring my cousins clothes and candy.

32:05.695 --> 32:09.589
For me, he'd bring medical books
and gadgets.

32:10.690 --> 32:13.331
On his last visit home,
he had a heart attack.

32:13.964 --> 32:16.167
A heart attack he would have survived

32:16.178 --> 32:19.112
if he had access to proper health care

32:19.296 --> 32:21.789
and not been in a hospital
in Arondizuogu

32:22.135 --> 32:24.487
without a working defibrillator.

32:29.353 --> 32:31.745
I think that's the most words
you've said, ever,

32:31.756 --> 32:34.034
in the past three years I've known you.

32:43.704 --> 32:46.073
Don't get used to it.

32:53.511 --> 32:55.859
<i>I don't know how I was still standing.</i>

32:56.550 --> 32:58.854
It hurt, but I still finished the show.

32:58.865 --> 33:03.127
My rendition of Albrecht's Act II
variation was "just perfection."

33:03.138 --> 33:05.174
At least, according to The <i> Times.</i>

33:05.185 --> 33:07.047
I would've paid to see that.

33:11.752 --> 33:13.198
Colleague issues?

33:13.534 --> 33:15.050
Father issues.

33:15.061 --> 33:18.065
You're talking to a male dancer
about daddy issues?

33:18.925 --> 33:20.683
Bet my old man was way worse.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.052
You think so?

33:22.063 --> 33:24.886
My dad couldn't wrap his head
around me wanting to dance ballet.

33:24.897 --> 33:27.758
So he forced me to go out
for football instead.

33:27.769 --> 33:30.595
He'd train me by making me run
stadium stairs

33:30.606 --> 33:32.697
carrying buckets of sand.

33:32.708 --> 33:35.267
My legs would burn,

33:35.941 --> 33:38.581
my lungs exploding.

33:38.592 --> 33:42.128
I was, like, 15 years old at the time
and I thought I was going to die.

33:42.956 --> 33:45.768
Never thought just inhaling air

33:45.779 --> 33:48.270
could be so excruciating.

33:48.281 --> 33:50.613
But my father didn't care.

33:50.623 --> 33:53.115
He just kept pushing.

33:53.125 --> 33:56.886
My dad was so bad, I went to fight
in Afghanistan for peace and quiet.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.245
You said you were 15 when this happened?

34:04.256 --> 34:05.776
Yeah.

34:06.862 --> 34:09.120
Funny thing is, my dad
still thinks I'm a wuss.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.620
Joke's on him. He doesn't
get how much strength

34:11.630 --> 34:12.940
it takes to do ballet.

34:12.951 --> 34:15.034
Was that the first time
you felt pain like that?

34:15.482 --> 34:17.433
Sure, yeah.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.898
But it would always go away
after the workout.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.469
Was your initial pain
centered in your diaphragm,

34:23.481 --> 34:25.150
right about where your ribs meet?

34:27.168 --> 34:28.768
How'd you know?

34:29.089 --> 34:31.183
I think I know what's wrong with you.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.920
Don't mess with me, Doc.

34:32.931 --> 34:36.847
Has anyone ever mentioned
median arcuate ligament syndrome to you?

34:40.170 --> 34:42.023
Hey. Have Lily's labs come back yet?

34:42.034 --> 34:44.047
She's about to start conditioning.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.260
Wait. This can't be right.

34:49.271 --> 34:51.063
Isabel, am I reading this correctly?

34:51.284 --> 34:53.846
Lily's in acute renal failure?

34:53.857 --> 34:55.659
I thought you were the doctor.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.471
My God. How did we miss that?

34:59.482 --> 35:01.338
If we proceed with the
transplant, she'll die.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.916
Call downstairs right now and make sure

35:02.927 --> 35:06.467
that they don't start her conditioning.
And page Dr. Hunter.

35:08.847 --> 35:10.994
<i>Lily, you're gonna be okay.</i>

35:15.268 --> 35:18.057
How did her initial labs not show
that her kidneys were failing?

35:18.068 --> 35:19.948
Yeah, I'm asking myself
the same question.

35:19.959 --> 35:21.223
Somebody clearly messed up.

35:21.234 --> 35:22.780
I'm gonna get down to the bottom of it

35:22.791 --> 35:24.202
as soon as I get back to my clinic.

35:24.213 --> 35:27.249
Whoever made this mistake will be fired.
I can promise you that.

35:27.260 --> 35:28.852
Dr. Hunter.

35:30.001 --> 35:31.921
If we would have proceeded
with this treatment,

35:31.932 --> 35:33.562
Lily would have likely died.

35:33.573 --> 35:37.616
Yes. You saved Lily's life
today, Dr. Pravesh.

35:37.627 --> 35:40.734
Excellent work. It's good
to know I was right about you.

35:40.745 --> 35:43.436
You're gonna make
an exceptional oncologist.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.151
Thank you. That means a lot.

35:57.028 --> 35:58.507
Okay.

35:58.518 --> 36:00.460
If Dr. Hawkins is right,

36:00.471 --> 36:03.229
and this is MALS,

36:03.867 --> 36:06.726
the minute this numbing agent
hits that celiac ganglion,

36:06.737 --> 36:09.497
you're gonna feel instant relief.

36:40.637 --> 36:43.063
How you feeling?

36:43.073 --> 36:45.467
Painfree.

36:45.477 --> 36:48.113
The first time in over a decade.

37:11.169 --> 37:12.826
Hey.

37:12.836 --> 37:14.129
Where the hell have you been?

37:14.139 --> 37:16.797
Patient's fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking.

37:16.807 --> 37:18.500
Turns out he has MALS.
Surgery's scheduled

37:18.510 --> 37:20.067
for next week after his final show.

37:20.077 --> 37:22.337
Hey.

37:22.347 --> 37:24.172
You think you're so damn smart.

37:24.182 --> 37:27.241
You know, one of these days
your need to play God

37:27.251 --> 37:29.844
with the rules is gonna
cost a patient their life.

37:29.854 --> 37:32.647
And when that happens, there'll
be a long line of us ready

37:32.657 --> 37:34.682
to make sure your medical career
goes up in flames.

37:34.693 --> 37:37.512
One man against an army.
Now you're talking my language.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.115
That gets me excited.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.580
You know what else gets me excited?

37:41.591 --> 37:43.451
Knowing that if your hand
is still on my arm

37:43.462 --> 37:45.338
in three seconds, you'll
be waking up in the ER

37:45.349 --> 37:48.019
with no memory of how you got there.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.070
<i>Carver is</i> even more
impressive in person.

38:01.081 --> 38:02.924
That's exactly what I want to hear.

38:02.935 --> 38:04.673
He'll be a great addition
to the surgical team.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.408
And I think his plans for tracking

38:06.418 --> 38:08.877
and publicizing all error rates
are really admirable.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.946
Wait. Publicizing outside
the walls of the hospital?

38:10.956 --> 38:13.043
Yeah, but I think once we get
through those lawsuits

38:13.054 --> 38:14.843
that that transparency causes,
we'll be...

38:14.854 --> 38:17.336
- Lawsuits?
- Yeah, lawsuits.

38:17.347 --> 38:19.686
But Chastain can weather those,
and maybe, you know,

38:19.697 --> 38:22.296
- even get ahead of the bad publicity.
- Right, of course.

38:22.307 --> 38:24.668
You know, we can spin it into
something we can make use of.

38:24.679 --> 38:27.215
You know, here's the thing,
Dr. Carver's very expensive.

38:27.226 --> 38:29.067
And I think I'm gonna have to
take a look at the budget.

38:29.078 --> 38:30.232
I'm not sure that Chastain

38:30.242 --> 38:33.269
can afford to make a competitive
offer at this time.

38:33.279 --> 38:35.203
That's a pity.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.973
Marshall.
I didn't expect to see you here.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.642
I had some unfinished business
with Dr. Hunter.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.278
Well, good news, I hope.

38:42.288 --> 38:44.078
Actually, I won't be investing

38:44.088 --> 38:45.948
in Chastain after all.

38:45.958 --> 38:47.616
It's just not the right fit for me.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.571
Well, that's a shame,

38:49.582 --> 38:51.453
that you couldn't have come
to that conclusion

38:51.463 --> 38:53.656
before wasting everybody's time.

38:53.666 --> 38:57.959
I appreciate your time
and hospitality, Claire.

38:57.969 --> 39:01.241
You wouldn't by chance know
where Dr. Hawkins is?

39:02.561 --> 39:04.453
Conrad Hawkins?

39:04.464 --> 39:06.190
I'm sure he's on the fifth floor.

39:06.201 --> 39:07.786
I can have one of the nurses page him.

39:07.797 --> 39:09.404
I wasn't aware you were acquainted.

39:09.414 --> 39:12.085
He's my son. Excuse me.

39:14.320 --> 39:17.429
Did you know?

39:17.440 --> 39:19.523
No idea.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.187
Regardless, makes no difference.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.857
Of course it does.

39:27.867 --> 39:32.026
A no now could very well be a yes later.

39:32.036 --> 39:35.442
- You haven't seen me work my magic.
- Yeah, dream on.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.870
Hey. I rushed back
as soon as I got your message.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.816
What's going on?

39:44.683 --> 39:46.341
You were right.

39:46.351 --> 39:50.178
I jul just... II can't believe this.

39:50.188 --> 39:53.482
It's crazy.

39:53.492 --> 39:57.546
That transplant...
with Lily's comorbidities.

39:57.557 --> 39:59.741
All right, Devon. I need you
to keep your voice down.

39:59.752 --> 40:01.390
Just tell me exactly what happened.

40:01.400 --> 40:05.572
Okay, I reran a full blood panel
on Lily without telling Lane.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.732
And the lab showed
that her kidneys are failing.

40:09.742 --> 40:11.499
Which means she's not eligible

40:11.509 --> 40:13.334
for a bone marrow transplant right now.

40:13.344 --> 40:16.205
Lane just played it off
like somebody at her clinic

40:16.215 --> 40:18.173
made a mistake, but I don't know...

40:18.183 --> 40:21.510
She had to have known, right?

40:21.520 --> 40:24.078
Why would Lane
proceed with the transplant?

40:24.088 --> 40:27.716
Money. Bone marrow transplants
are the Super Bowl

40:27.726 --> 40:31.086
of cancer treatments
when it comes to billing.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.589
Lily would have died.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.926
You were right.

40:36.936 --> 40:40.528
We have to do something about Lane.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.272
Let's just try to
stay out of each other's way

40:51.282 --> 40:53.542
while you're doing whatever
business with the hospital.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.078
I'm not investing in the hospital.

40:56.088 --> 40:58.212
Truth is, I never was.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.915
I was just doing some recon, that's all.

41:00.925 --> 41:03.017
Recon for what?

41:03.027 --> 41:05.787
I'm opening a small private hospital.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.524
What I hope will be the first of many.

41:08.534 --> 41:11.125
And I don't just want you to work there.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.239
I want you to run it...

41:15.574 --> 41:19.935
after you finish this final
year of residency, of course.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.136
- What?
- Just hear me out.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.807
You can do what you love to do.

41:24.817 --> 41:27.942
Interact with the patients while
training your doctors your way,

41:27.952 --> 41:31.123
without all of this bureaucratic
mess over your head.

41:33.038 --> 41:35.216
You trying to buy your way back
into my life again?

41:35.226 --> 41:38.252
Maybe I am. The point is,

41:38.262 --> 41:40.254
this is something
that's important to you,

41:40.264 --> 41:42.734
and it's important to me
to help you get it.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.997
Conrad, I am trying.

41:48.007 --> 41:50.499
II don't need an answer right now.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.567
Just think about it.

41:52.577 --> 41:54.346
You know how to reach me
when you're ready.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.848
Who's that?

42:05.858 --> 42:07.682
My father.

42:11.063 --> 42:12.921
Your father?

42:15.534 --> 42:17.153
Are we really not gonna talk about this?

42:17.164 --> 42:18.813
No, we're not.

42:19.797 --> 42:21.180
I'll see you later.

42:21.191 --> 42:22.959
Hey. Talk to me.

42:26.696 --> 42:29.163
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.

42:30.969 --> 42:32.368
Look, if this is about Jude...

42:32.379 --> 42:34.739
Nic, no explanation necessary.
It's your life.

42:35.797 --> 42:37.789
Conrad...

42:41.793 --> 42:44.453
You told me repeatedly that
this thing was over between us.

42:44.463 --> 42:46.132
I just didn't want to hear it.

42:48.719 --> 42:50.902
That's on me.
