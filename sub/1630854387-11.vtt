WEBVTT

01:03.855 --> 01:05.899
[computer whirring]

01:30.298 --> 01:32.801
- [Kory] Hey.
- You find anything?

01:34.010 --> 01:35.762
[sighs and whispers] No.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.222
Sebastian's gone underground.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.308
Any word on Conner?

01:40.308 --> 01:41.684
They must be together.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.603
We're running
a bridge and toll search.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.980
If one of them
shows their faces,
we'll find both of them.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.315
Okay.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.654
All those people down there.

01:53.947 --> 01:59.202
They don't know about Horns
or Trigons or magical powers.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.412
They'll go to bed, wake up,
make their coffee

02:01.412 --> 02:03.039
and go to work
like any other day.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.291
Or not.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.384
If you could be anywhere else

02:14.384 --> 02:15.426
[chuckles] on Earth right now,

02:15.426 --> 02:16.511
where would you be?

02:18.805 --> 02:19.848
[chuckles softly]

02:23.643 --> 02:25.019
I don't know.
Here is pretty nice.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.314
[chuckles softly]

02:32.610 --> 02:34.237
Yeah, here's pretty nice.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.452
[cell phone beeping]

02:47.667 --> 02:49.419
- Gotta get back.
- Yeah.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.563
How's Bernard?

03:09.772 --> 03:11.107
No change.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.152
Theta waves with
intermittent hypsarrhythmia.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.780
He's in status.
Continuous seizures.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.282
But we're gonna try
upping the phenobarb,

03:19.282 --> 03:20.742
see if we can interrupt
the cycle.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.286
Can I see him?

03:24.162 --> 03:26.289
Not now.
We're still running scans.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.790
I'll keep you posted. Okay?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.084
Yeah. Thank you.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.385
- [Tim] Going somewhere?
- Nope.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.179
You are.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.848
I need you back in Gotham.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.059
You're sending me home?

03:46.559 --> 03:47.644
Kinda.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.228
There's a guy who used
to work for the organization.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.855
He has information
on Mother Mayhem,

03:51.397 --> 03:52.440
and we need it.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.987
I don't know, Dick.
Bernard's not
looking good, man.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.906
You're not doing him
any good by being here.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.035
The guy's name is Venta.
He lives down on Harbor.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.036
I told him you were coming.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.872
[sighs] That's it?

04:10.166 --> 04:12.627
Just get the information
and report back?

04:13.211 --> 04:14.045
That's it.

04:15.254 --> 04:16.089
[exhales]

04:19.759 --> 04:21.928
Keep your eyes open.
Gotham's still Gotham.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.765
Need you back in one piece.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.187
If anything changes
with Bernard, I'll call you.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.774
Well, what about the suitcase?

04:38.444 --> 04:39.320
I don't know.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.571
Open it.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.691
[reporter on TV]
<i>Sebastian Sanger's fans
worldwide are demanding answers</i>

05:16.691 --> 05:19.777
<i>on why his game's
been shut down.</i>

05:19.777 --> 05:22.572
<i>This amid concerns
that the global sensation</i>

05:22.572 --> 05:25.450
<i>could be causing mysterious
medical side effects.</i>

05:27.785 --> 05:29.412
<i>But the biggest mystery of all,</i>

05:30.329 --> 05:31.789
<i>where is Sebastian Sanger?</i>

05:31.789 --> 05:32.707
[screams]

05:39.380 --> 05:40.381
Patience.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.717
[scoffs]

05:42.717 --> 05:46.304
You know, your friends
destroyed my game.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.598
And they took my powers.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.225
So don't tell me
to have patience.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.311
I want them back now!

05:56.898 --> 05:58.858
The Titans
aren't my friends.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.445
And they didn't
take your powers.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.115
It was your mother.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.993
What are you talking about?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.787
Retribution.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.997
For you refusing
to call your daddy.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.501
Don't worry.

06:18.711 --> 06:19.629
It's okay.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.422
We kill her,

06:22.090 --> 06:24.008
powers will be restored.

06:24.008 --> 06:26.469
Then we're back on track
to run the world,

06:26.469 --> 06:29.847
however the fuck we want.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.183
[chuckles softly]

06:33.351 --> 06:40.316
[people chanting]
<i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos.</i>

06:42.735 --> 06:43.820
[sighs]

06:47.615 --> 06:50.076
I told you we would
be back here
when the time was right.

06:54.622 --> 06:58.167
The Titans destroyed
Sebastian's beloved game.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.505
Finally, they're
proving useful.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.007
After what he's done to you,

07:06.259 --> 07:08.386
it will take more than that.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.762
You asked to see me, Mother?

07:16.352 --> 07:17.812
Leave us.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.730
[people muttering indistinctly]

07:24.944 --> 07:27.113
[Julie] Has Brother Blood
returned with the Horn?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.657
I hear the time is near.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.616
[Mother Mayhem] It is.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.244
But are you ready to serve him?

07:34.203 --> 07:35.288
You doubt my devotion?

07:36.038 --> 07:36.998
[chuckles]

07:38.249 --> 07:39.125
Perhaps.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.424
I would do anything
for your son.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.594
I've always known
that he was special.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.680
Since we first met,
I could see it.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.099
I could feel it.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.143
- [chuckles nervously]
- [Mother Mayhem laughs]

07:59.770 --> 08:02.398
Your devotion is pure.

08:05.902 --> 08:10.239
So, I would like
to ask for your help.

08:13.075 --> 08:19.457
Those with great power
cannot sense without
the sacrifice of others.

08:19.457 --> 08:24.337
It may sound forward of me
as a mother to suggest this,

08:24.337 --> 08:25.463
but to complete his journey,

08:25.463 --> 08:31.344
my son needs someone
to give of themselves.

08:35.514 --> 08:36.349
Give?

08:37.767 --> 08:38.601
Yes.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.815
I'm speaking very bluntly
of your body.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.442
[exhales]

08:46.442 --> 08:48.736
For this intimate task,

08:48.736 --> 08:51.948
I need a heart
with unwavering devotion.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.827
But you're free to say no.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.913
As with anything
in my son's journey,

08:59.664 --> 09:01.916
it must be by choice.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.129
I'm honored that you chose me.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.342
It may please you
to know that I've

09:12.176 --> 09:13.552
never been with any other.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.973
My heart has belonged
to your son

09:16.973 --> 09:18.516
since the day we first met.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.394
Oh.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.649
And so it shall remain.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.650
- [squelching]
- [gasps]

09:27.650 --> 09:29.735
- [grunts]
- [groans]

09:30.236 --> 09:31.028
[thuds]

09:47.461 --> 09:48.462
[grunts]

09:59.598 --> 10:01.350
[siren wailing]

10:04.270 --> 10:05.521
[man 1] Come on. Let's go.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.362
[both panting]

10:13.362 --> 10:14.405
[man 2] Put this in the bag.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.371
Evening, boys.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.000
Who the fuck are you?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.711
I'm looking for Venta.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.795
[man 1] Who's asking?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.797
A friend of Dick Grayson.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.258
[man 2] The Flying Grayson?

10:34.258 --> 10:35.217
That's the one.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.886
[man 2] Any friend
of Dick Grayson

10:36.886 --> 10:39.221
[screams] is a fucking
dead man!

10:39.221 --> 10:41.349
Get a load of this, Gotham.
[grunts]

10:42.391 --> 10:44.143
[all grunting]

10:56.489 --> 10:58.157
- [gun fires]
- [grunts]

10:59.367 --> 11:00.785
[panting]

11:00.785 --> 11:02.411
- [shouts]
- [thuds and groans]

11:02.411 --> 11:04.080
- [gun cocking]
- [man 1] Bye-bye,
little birdie.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.873
[both men shout]

11:05.873 --> 11:06.957
[gun firing]

11:09.835 --> 11:10.836
[grunting]

11:12.171 --> 11:13.464
[chokes and thuds]

11:13.464 --> 11:15.257
- [gun fires]
- Argh! [groans]

11:37.238 --> 11:38.239
[chuckles]

11:39.657 --> 11:41.409
Who the fuck are you
supposed to be?

11:46.747 --> 11:47.623
I'm Robin.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.544
[theme music playing]

12:13.023 --> 12:14.942
- [policewoman] Ms. Anders?
- [Kory] Yes.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.527
There's something
I think you should see.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.158
[tablet beeping]

12:32.460 --> 12:34.503
[cell phone vibrating]

12:48.517 --> 12:50.019
Morning. Are these vegan?

12:51.270 --> 12:53.689
- [Rachel] Hey, Gar.
- Morning to you, too.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.025
Morning. Have you seen Tim?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.068
No, Dick sent him
to Gotham on assignment.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.529
Gotham?

13:02.156 --> 13:03.449
Do you think
Tim's ready for that?

13:04.283 --> 13:05.242
Dick thinks he is.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.828
[mutters] Oh,
Dick thinks he is.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.209
Guess it's a trend now.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.127
People disappearing
without telling me.

13:17.338 --> 13:20.716
Sorry, I know I've been
kind of scarce lately.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.968
It's okay.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.386
You've been
spending time in The Red?

13:25.095 --> 13:26.514
Yeah.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.600
And the more I do,
the less I'm sure
where I'm supposed to be.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.977
Here or there.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.272
I think it's there.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.775
- Wow.
- [both laugh]

13:37.775 --> 13:39.109
- Nice knowing you too.
- [chuckles] No.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.528
No, that's not what I meant.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.904
It's just...

13:41.904 --> 13:44.448
I've been feeling
a similar way,
you know, like,

13:45.824 --> 13:48.661
I just want a change,
something different.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.703
Like what?

13:49.703 --> 13:51.080
I don't know.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.999
I just feel like
I'm standing on the edge
of a cliff and I just...

13:55.125 --> 13:57.586
I wanna jump.
I wanna, I wanna see.

13:58.754 --> 13:59.755
Maybe you should, too.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.676
Maybe I wanna know
what's at the bottom
of the cliff first.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.763
I don't think
it works like that.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.848
I think we just got to do it.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.852
Hey, you guys seen Kory?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.437
[both] No.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.815
All right, check around,
find out who saw her last.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.899
- [Gar] On it.
- [Rachel] Okay.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.069
[mutters] Oh.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.947
- [Rachel] Gar.
- I'm coming.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.699
[Rachel] Jesus.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.246
[Sebastian] Conner,
where are you?

14:34.331 --> 14:35.499
What's the plan?

14:35.499 --> 14:36.959
Call me back, okay?

14:39.962 --> 14:42.965
We hurt the ones we love
the most.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.092
[breathing heavily]

14:48.971 --> 14:51.974
I have to say,
really fucking hurt.

14:52.891 --> 14:53.809
I'm sorry.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.191
You took my powers.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.360
I did no such thing.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.948
Your powers are yours,

15:09.533 --> 15:10.993
if you use them wisely.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.876
You want me
to bring back my father.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.714
I need something for myself.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.969
I know what you crave.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.306
You've tasted it now.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.308
The power, the adulation.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.268
I know.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.520
If you bring back your father,

15:40.648 --> 15:43.192
you'll get everything
you ever wanted.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.670
[Sebastian breathes heavily]

16:08.300 --> 16:09.426
[grunting in pain]
What is this?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.387
[gasps]

16:15.974 --> 16:17.226
[grunting]

16:23.023 --> 16:24.274
Meet me at the Temple tonight.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.569
[Sebastian breathing heavily]

16:42.668 --> 16:44.586
Somebody said
they saw Kory come in here.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.297
Anybody seen Starfire?

16:47.297 --> 16:48.841
[people muttering indistinctly]

16:54.763 --> 16:55.639
She's got something.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.439
So you spoke to Ms. Anders?

17:03.439 --> 17:05.774
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.568
Yeah, you do.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.157
I don't consent to them
using their powers
to analyze me.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.283
I didn't use my powers.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.617
She's just a bad liar.

17:21.165 --> 17:21.957
Fine.

17:23.959 --> 17:28.422
Ms. Anders asked me to try
and track Superboy
using our Satcom Heat Tracker.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.592
Normally, we just use it
to detect thermal activity.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.679
But since Superboy's
laser vision has
a heat signature, I got a hit.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.141
Why didn't you tell us?

17:39.141 --> 17:42.311
Ms. Anders preferred
that I keep that information
to myself.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.611
- [Jason] Venta?
- [Tim] Yeah.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.321
He lives down on Harbor.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.072
[Jason] Never heard of him.

17:54.072 --> 17:56.408
Dick says he's got information
on the Organization.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.703
Maybe we could team up on this.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.757
[Jason] How long you been doing
this Robin thing?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.342
[Tim] Uh...

18:13.967 --> 18:15.260
Not long.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.345
[Jason] A couple weeks?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.263
Not quite.

18:18.847 --> 18:19.681
A week?

18:20.808 --> 18:22.184

18:23.936 --> 18:25.813
Oh, the suit did look
fresh off the rack.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.816
If I were you,
I'd get out of Gotham.

Tucson or some shit.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.861

to find Venta.

you sent him on,

than just your name.

this weapon is designed
to replicate your blue light.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.293
Lex knew you had the power
to stop Brother Blood.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.754
He wanted that power
for himself,

29:16.754 --> 29:18.465
so he attempted
to replicate it.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.509

29:21.509 --> 29:23.052
is that even possible?

29:25.180 --> 29:28.183
You'd be surprised
what jealousy and a shit ton
of money can do.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.893
[Mercy] It wasn't jealousy.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.187
He was determined to leave
an enduring legacy.

of LexCorp,

he spent millions developing

Are you saying
he actually completed it?

29:52.290 --> 29:53.666
Looks like it, yeah.

29:57.795 --> 29:59.589
Lex had a lab

29:59.589 --> 30:02.050
where he conducted his weapons'
development and testing.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.261
I believe its location
and the access codes

30:05.261 --> 30:07.013
are somewhere
in those encrypted files.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.473
Which...

30:10.141 --> 30:11.351
is now ours.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.228
You really need
to take all the files?

30:13.895 --> 30:16.272
No. but we're gonna.

30:22.570 --> 30:23.613
You should know, uh,

30:24.989 --> 30:26.741
I gave a copy of those files
to Conner.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.202
Before he went rogue.

30:29.202 --> 30:32.163
So if he unencrypts
them before us...

30:33.331 --> 30:35.583
He can destroy it
before we even get there.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.335
What if he already has?

30:37.335 --> 30:38.670
One step at a time.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.053
[breathing heavily]

32:56.224 --> 32:57.058
[Jason] Hey.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.186
You owe me a new laptop.

33:00.186 --> 33:03.564
The dustbuster,
I'll forget about
'cause it was broken anyways.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.441
You were watching
and didn't help?

33:05.441 --> 33:08.611
Actually, I'm surprised
it took Shimmer's gang
this long to get here

33:08.611 --> 33:10.446
after I let them
triangulate my location.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.408
Let them?

33:16.994 --> 33:18.162
You learn by doing,

33:19.831 --> 33:20.957
not being coddled.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.377
- [shakes hand]
- You're welcome.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.840
[Jason] Nicely done.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.303
Thanks.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.861
You said he would be
useful to us.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.654
How?

33:56.826 --> 34:00.997
The blood running
through his veins is infused
with your mother's magic.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.086
We need to transfer
that power to you.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.056
When he comes,

34:20.308 --> 34:21.976
it will rain heavenly succor

34:22.977 --> 34:24.687
on those who believed,

34:24.687 --> 34:25.897
those who endured.

34:26.647 --> 34:27.815
[exhales]

34:27.815 --> 34:30.818
Take my corporeal form! Please.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.236
Let me pour it in your cup.

34:32.236 --> 34:35.323
Grant me the power
to crush your enemies.

34:35.740 --> 34:36.657
[grunts]

34:36.657 --> 34:38.451
I am your servant. [groans]

34:39.744 --> 34:40.620
[screams]

34:41.204 --> 34:42.038
[moans in pain]

34:49.629 --> 34:50.463
Drink.

35:00.848 --> 35:01.724
[The Confessor] No.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.561
[The Confessor sobbing]

35:09.106 --> 35:11.150
[The Confessor screaming]

35:12.610 --> 35:15.822
Argh! No, no, no, no, no.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.532
[sobs] Please, please.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.826
Make him stop. Make him stop.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.679
[panting]

35:40.805 --> 35:43.432
I can feel her power
rise in me.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.284
[grunts]

36:04.495 --> 36:06.539
[breathes heavily]

36:07.623 --> 36:09.000
[Jason] <i>Sorry,
I gotta kick you out.</i>

36:09.000 --> 36:12.211
I have a rule about fish
and new Robins,
24 hours max.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.421
[Tim] It's all good.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.839
I gotta get back anyway.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.132
Check on my boyfriend.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.301
[Jason] If I hear about
your guy, Venta, I'll hit you.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.343
Sorry, it was a bust.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.970
[Tim] I'm glad I came.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.555
I got to meet
the great Red Hood.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.348
[chuckles] Was I
on your fucking bucket list?

36:24.348 --> 36:26.350
- [Tim] Kind of, yeah.
- [both laugh]

36:26.350 --> 36:28.269
Well, good luck in Metropolis.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.731
And if shit hits the fan,
just hide behind
Raven and Starfire.

36:31.731 --> 36:32.648
[Tim] Got it.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.819
- Enjoy the ride home.
- [keys jangling]

36:57.131 --> 36:58.007
[Dick on phone] <i>Jason.</i>

36:59.008 --> 37:00.259
<i>How'd it go?</i>

37:00.259 --> 37:02.178
[Jason on phone] <i>Sending him
back to you in one piece.</i>

37:02.178 --> 37:03.971
[Dick] <i>Hope you didn't go
too easy on him.</i>

37:03.971 --> 37:05.222
[Jason] <i>Don't worry, I didn't.</i>

37:08.142 --> 37:09.060
[Jason] <i>And, Dick...</i>

37:12.230 --> 37:13.648
He'll be a better Robin
than me.

37:25.242 --> 37:26.160
[cell phone clicks]

37:27.536 --> 37:28.371
[Dick] Gar?

37:31.666 --> 37:34.085
[Dick on speaker]
<i>We're in the north tunnel.
Which way next?</i>

37:34.085 --> 37:35.920
About 100 yards ahead
is a storage room.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.880
Follow the steps up
into the facility.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.840
I'll turn off
the motion detectors.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.134
Once inside,
there's a security code
for the lab.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.552
We're working on cracking that.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.309
We might have
a bigger problem.

37:55.272 --> 37:56.190
[Conner] It's okay.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.359
I'm on your side.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.737
Let me talk to him.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.330
You want to take a swing at me,
I wouldn't blame you.

38:11.330 --> 38:14.041
I would, but I'd probably
break my hand. [chuckles]

38:14.041 --> 38:15.126
[chuckles]

38:20.464 --> 38:22.425
I thought I could do it myself.

38:23.592 --> 38:24.760
Stop Sebastian.

38:26.971 --> 38:27.847
Stop them both.

38:30.307 --> 38:31.434
Could've asked for help.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.853
I needed to do it alone.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.439
I had to prove it.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.107
To who?

38:39.066 --> 38:39.859
Lex.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.486
Superman.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.037
You.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.123
I made things worse.

38:55.875 --> 38:56.959
I did things...

39:00.671 --> 39:03.674
Things Titans don't do.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.303
People like us,

39:09.388 --> 39:10.806
we're close to the darkness.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.017
We seek it out.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.188
Sometimes, it has its way.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.734
We're supposed to be better.

39:21.734 --> 39:22.777
[Dick] Sometimes we're not.

39:23.736 --> 39:24.862
That's why we have each other.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.866
I tried, I...
I tried to keep
Sebastian close.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.327
Use his game as a distraction.

39:32.244 --> 39:33.829
When I found out
it was hurting people,

39:33.829 --> 39:36.665
I created a vulnerability
in the code to try
to help you bring it down.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.127
Yeah, I figured that was you.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.088
[Conner] It wasn't enough.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.467
[breathes deeply]
I'm sorry, Dick.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.388
We can fix this.

39:52.723 --> 39:53.557
Together.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.393
You'd trust me again?

39:58.062 --> 39:59.230
The truth is, we need you.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.151
How do the others
feel about that?

40:05.736 --> 40:06.570
[Kory] Dick...

40:10.658 --> 40:12.785
Gar cracked the security code
into Lex's lab.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.205
So is he in or out?

40:24.630 --> 40:25.464
He's in.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.637
[machine buzzes]

40:39.770 --> 40:40.855
[Dick on speaker]
<i>Security code?</i>

40:43.274 --> 40:44.358
You're gonna love this.

40:52.491 --> 40:53.325
[Kory] Charming.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.758
Construction of the shell
is nested,

41:10.801 --> 41:12.553
perfectly aligned,
to the nanometer.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.389
Kinetic shielding,

41:15.389 --> 41:19.727
but the surface of each plate
has a micro array
of energy absorption

41:19.727 --> 41:21.979
to house the energy
across the sphere itself.

41:23.522 --> 41:26.442
The internal mechanics
are flawless and fully intact.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.985
Whoa.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.112
Maybe don't touch anything
until we understand
how it fully works.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.072
Well, actually, uh,

41:33.240 --> 41:34.241
it doesn't.

41:34.241 --> 41:36.076
- What?
- [Gar on speaker]
<i>Conner's right.</i>

41:36.076 --> 41:39.121
According to Lex's files,
the engineering is complete,

41:39.121 --> 41:42.041
but it's lacking
an energy source
to activate it.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.919
My blue light.

41:44.919 --> 41:48.714
[chuckles] So, Lex wasn't
keeping tabs on you
to learn about your powers.

41:48.714 --> 41:49.632
He needed you.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.134
Honestly, who doesn't?

41:52.134 --> 41:53.969
[Rachel on speaker] <i>So how do
we activate this thing?</i>

41:53.969 --> 41:56.722
The orb's like
a nuclear grenade,

41:56.722 --> 41:59.183
meant only to be launched
at a metahuman.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.309
If the math is right,

42:01.268 --> 42:03.312
the meta human absorbs
all of the blast.

42:03.312 --> 42:06.106
Otherwise, it'll blow
a hole in the planet.

42:06.106 --> 42:07.233
If the math is right.

42:08.525 --> 42:11.195
Activation is fairly straightforward.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.989
Kory infuses the orb
with her power,

42:13.989 --> 42:16.533
and it's designed to initiate
a fission chain reaction.

42:18.035 --> 42:21.163
And then the orb
holds the energy
until we pull the pin.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.539
That's pretty much the idea.

42:23.999 --> 42:25.668
So wait, has this thing
ever been tested?

42:27.753 --> 42:29.338
Prototype.

42:29.338 --> 42:33.425
So, if I set off
the fission reaction,

42:33.425 --> 42:37.054
there's no way to know
if the weapon will destroy
Brother Blood or--

42:37.054 --> 42:38.055
Kill us all.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.868
All right. We all clear
on how this goes down?

42:59.868 --> 43:01.620
I blast the orb with my energy.

43:01.620 --> 43:02.955
[Gar on speaker]
<i>I'll track the heat index.</i>

43:02.955 --> 43:04.123
I'll watch the pressure.

43:04.123 --> 43:07.001
And when both indexes
are at 100 percent,

43:07.001 --> 43:09.503
that means the fission reaction
is complete.

43:09.503 --> 43:11.005
That's when you take over.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.257
Kory will exit while
you stabilize the orb.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.092
And then we all do
some deep breathing.

43:15.092 --> 43:18.637
When she's out of here,
I'll activate the vault's
nuclear containment shield,

43:18.637 --> 43:19.847
in case something goes wrong.

43:22.599 --> 43:23.392
You ready?

43:24.059 --> 43:24.852
Ready.

43:30.316 --> 43:31.734

- I don't know
if it's gonna hold!
- We're not at 100%.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.300
- Heat's at 96.
- [Rachel] Pressure, 94.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.426
Kory, get out of there.

44:39.426 --> 44:41.011
No, this is our only chance.

Dick, you need to get her
out of there.

44:49.895 --> 44:52.022

45:53.083 --> 45:55.502
I really wish it was
somebody else doing it.

that can get the orb
close enough to Sebastian.

But guess what?

48:53.513 --> 48:55.057
You underestimated me.

48:55.974 --> 48:57.476
Just like everyone else.

49:00.937 --> 49:02.147
I'm done with you.

49:04.775 --> 49:05.776
My sweet child,

49:08.236 --> 49:10.405
the Titans are done with you.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.116
Don't you see?

49:17.371 --> 49:19.956
They're filling your head
with lies.

49:21.291 --> 49:23.293
[breathes deeply]

49:23.960 --> 49:25.837
The world can be yours.

49:29.841 --> 49:31.426
We're so close.

49:34.888 --> 49:36.723
Don't let them
take that away from you.

49:38.600 --> 49:39.518
[exhales]

49:42.312 --> 49:45.315
[whispers] I won't let anyone
take that away from me.

49:46.483 --> 49:47.317
[gasps] Argh!

49:48.777 --> 49:49.986
[grunting]

49:57.744 --> 49:58.912
[groaning]

50:00.664 --> 50:02.040
[both grunting]

50:05.544 --> 50:06.503
[Mother Mayhem groans]

50:11.007 --> 50:12.718
[grunting]

50:21.476 --> 50:23.520
[Sebastian screaming]

50:38.535 --> 50:39.745
[shuddering]

50:47.043 --> 50:47.878
[Conner] Hey.

50:52.549 --> 50:53.383
Catch.

50:54.551 --> 50:55.385
[Sebastian grunts]

51:01.975 --> 51:03.226
[Sebastian screaming]

51:11.610 --> 51:12.486
[Sebastian grunts]

51:13.862 --> 51:14.654
[exhales]

51:42.390 --> 51:43.266
My turn.

51:44.184 --> 51:45.519
[screams]

51:46.061 --> 51:46.978
[Conner grunts]

51:54.945 --> 51:55.821
What happened?

51:57.989 --> 52:00.033
The orb never reached
its heat apex.

52:00.033 --> 52:03.870
It's like it was subsumed
before it could
deal the killing blow.

52:03.870 --> 52:06.039
Subsumed by what?

52:07.040 --> 52:08.208
Wild guess?

52:10.794 --> 52:12.629
It wasn't strong enough.

52:12.629 --> 52:14.130
I shut it off too soon.

52:14.130 --> 52:15.257
[Rachel] What about Conner?

52:47.831 --> 52:49.791
[blowing]

53:17.068 --> 53:18.612
There's only one way
to end this.

53:22.699 --> 53:23.617
My way.

53:46.056 --> 53:48.099
