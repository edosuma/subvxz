WEBVTT

00:08.443 --> 00:11.011
Last season
onStar Trek: Discovery...

00:11.054 --> 00:13.926
This is mutiny.Move, Saru. Fire.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.146
GEORGIOU:
Stand down.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.018
Captain, incoming.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.236
Warp signatures detected.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.593
No!

00:28.637 --> 00:30.073
JUDGE:
For the charge of mutiny,

00:30.117 --> 00:31.814
it is our ruling
that the defendant

00:31.857 --> 00:33.990
be stripped of rank
and hereby sentenced

00:34.034 --> 00:36.210
to imprisonment for life.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.994
LORCA:
You helped start a war.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.256
Don't you want
to help me end it?

00:42.216 --> 00:44.870
We will be able
to materialize anywhere

00:44.914 --> 00:47.003
in the known universe. That's
how you beat the Klingons.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.787
STAMETS:
Only one more jump.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.617
BURNHAM:
We are in a parallel universe,

00:52.661 --> 00:53.966
one governed
by the Terran Empire.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.056
Don't you bow
before your emperor?

00:58.145 --> 01:00.451
BURNHAM: My so-called captain's
not from my universe.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.714
He's from yours.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.415
CORNWELL:
Klingons are on the verge

01:07.458 --> 01:10.157
of wiping out the Federation.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.071
We do not have the
luxury of principles.

01:11.114 --> 01:13.116
That is all we have, Admiral.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.249
Do we need a mutiny today

01:15.292 --> 01:18.469
to prove who we are?

01:18.513 --> 01:21.124
We are Starfleet.

01:21.168 --> 01:25.085
BURNHAM: The war is over.
There were triumphs.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.912
Victories of spirit.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.262
Courage beyond reason.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.133
These were bleak times,

01:30.177 --> 01:32.004
times we cannot forget.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.397
We will not allow desperation

01:33.441 --> 01:37.009
to destroy moral authority.

01:37.053 --> 01:41.101
That is the United Federation
of Planets.

01:45.801 --> 01:48.282
TILLY:
Captain on the bridge.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.197
Actingcaptain.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.068
Please take your stations.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.156
Lieutenant Detmer,

01:53.200 --> 01:54.940
set course for Vulcan and engage

01:54.984 --> 01:56.246
at maximum warp.Aye, sir.

02:04.036 --> 02:04.994
Incoming transmission.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.213
Identify the source, please.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.779
I'm getting
the Federation ID code.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.172
I-It's choppy.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.174
Trying to clean it up, sir.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.523
Helm, slow us down.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.872
Dropping us out
of warp now, sir.

02:15.657 --> 02:16.919
Hail is from Captain Pike, sir.

02:16.962 --> 02:19.095
It's the USS Enterprise.

02:46.253 --> 02:49.169
BURNHAM:
Space.

02:50.213 --> 02:53.173
The final frontier.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.481
Above us.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.225
Around us.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.142
Within us.

03:08.275 --> 03:11.800
We have always looked
to the stars

03:11.843 --> 03:14.106
to discover who we are.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.462
A thousand centuries ago
in Africa,

03:21.505 --> 03:25.379
the ÷¦Xam Abathwa tribe gathered to share a story.

03:25.422 --> 03:30.253
The tale of a girl who dug
her hands in the wood ash

03:30.297 --> 03:33.125
and threw it into the sky
to create

03:33.169 --> 03:35.127
the Milky Way.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.564
And hidden there,

03:36.607 --> 03:40.698
a secret buried
among the eternal stars,

03:40.742 --> 03:42.787
was a message.

03:42.831 --> 03:47.270
An enormous letter in a bottle
made of space and time,

03:47.314 --> 03:51.318
visible only to those
whose hearts were open enough

03:51.361 --> 03:53.363
to receive it.

03:55.452 --> 03:58.412
A child has come to us.

03:58.455 --> 04:01.328
She's human.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.071
SAREK:
She is orphaned.

04:06.115 --> 04:09.205
It is our responsibility.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.559
AMANDA:
What happened to her parents?

04:17.605 --> 04:21.783
SAREK:
The unthinkable.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.762
My name is Amanda.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.202
What's yours?

04:52.248 --> 04:54.381
Michael.

05:04.086 --> 05:07.089
I bless you, Michael.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.312
All my life.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.280
Do you want to meet our son?

05:28.284 --> 05:30.460
BURNHAM:
When I first heard the story

05:30.504 --> 05:33.158
of the girl who made the stars,

05:33.202 --> 05:36.205
I wasn't ready to understand.

05:39.382 --> 05:42.342
I still don't know if I am.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.139
Spock.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.321
Spock.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.411
This is Michael Burnham.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.326
She will be staying with us.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.894
You will be teaching her
the ways of Vulcan.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.593
I expect you to be friends.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.505
Hello.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.729
Ops, please tell
me what is wrong.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.122
Does she need our assistance?

07:07.165 --> 07:08.428
Unable to comply, Captain.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.994
Enterprise
is completely off-line.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.518
Except for life support.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.389
Scans show
203 crew members aboard.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.391
The vessel's
entire complement is alive.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.349
BRYCE: They're still sending
a priority one distress call,

07:17.393 --> 07:20.352
but the signal's too compromised
for voice transmission.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.529
Morse code might get through!

07:22.572 --> 07:25.706
Sorry. Sorry.
It's just there was static.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.534
You know, then Comms
kind of turned it down.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.013
But... I mean, obviously.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.450
Sorry.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.451
Hey, go, Comms.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.756
Um, can Enterpriseswitch

07:32.800 --> 07:35.629
to Morse code?Excellent suggestion, Ensign.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.282
Mr. Bryce, please try that.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.632
STAMETS:
A former colleague

07:38.675 --> 07:40.198
is an ethnobotanist
on that ship.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.939
I've seen its specs.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.246
Only something catastrophic

07:44.289 --> 07:46.596
could knock her out.Helm, do you detect

07:46.640 --> 07:49.512
any escape pods or shuttles?Negative, sir.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.514
Damn, she's a beauty.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.777
Transmission coming through.
Captain Christopher Pike

07:53.821 --> 07:55.387
requests permission
to come aboard.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.564
He has an engineer
and science officer with him.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.479
SARU:
Permission granted.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.438
Commander Burnham,

08:02.482 --> 08:05.528
you will join me
in welcoming them.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.704
Yes, sir.

08:10.968 --> 08:15.103
I had not expected
to see Spock again.

08:15.146 --> 08:18.106
Neither had I.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.643
MALE: Attention, all.
Prepare for duty.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.603
Please report
to your division duty officer.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.562
Your brother is the science
officer on theEnterprise.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.695
Foster brother.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.913
I can sense your endocrine
system in overdrive.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.567
: You are
anxious to see him.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.569
I'm fine, Saru.Oh, I was using the term

10:13.613 --> 10:15.571
in its most positive sense,
meaning "anticipatory."

10:15.615 --> 10:17.138
We received a priority alert

10:17.181 --> 10:18.835
from one of Starfleet's
most prominent ships.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.968
I am on mission
and in problem-solving mode.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.578
That's what you're sensing.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.928
Hmm.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.538
MALE :
Order confirmed
Transport coordinates locked.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.279
Do you have any siblings?

10:28.323 --> 10:30.760
Oh, a sister.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.197
Siranna.

10:33.241 --> 10:36.200
Uh, I do not expect
a reunion with her.

10:36.244 --> 10:39.987
Sadly, there is terrain
between us we cannot navigate.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.772
I know the feeling.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.427
MALE: Transporter locked status.
Energizing.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.706
SARU:
Welcome aboard,

11:03.750 --> 11:04.968
Captain Pike.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.622
I am Commander Saru,

11:06.666 --> 11:09.233
acting captain
of the USS Discovery.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.887
How may we be of service?

11:10.931 --> 11:12.672
Well, Commander,
this is awkward,

11:12.715 --> 11:14.674
but back in Mojave,
I learned the best way

11:14.717 --> 11:17.241
to get into a cold stream
was to jump right in.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.983
Uh... yeah.Ah.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.507
I'm here at Starfleet's order
to take command of the Discovery

11:22.551 --> 11:25.075
under Regulation 19,
Section "C."

11:25.119 --> 11:26.642
Well, we received

11:26.686 --> 11:27.948
no notice from Starfleet.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.732
PIKE: Because I asked
to deliver the news myself

11:29.776 --> 11:31.691
out of a respect for what you

11:31.734 --> 11:33.040
and your crew have been through.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.432
Forgive me, Captain.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.043
Your directive is
only instituted

11:36.086 --> 11:37.784
under three contingencies:

11:37.827 --> 11:40.047
when an imminent
threat is detected,

11:40.090 --> 11:42.789
when the lives of Federation
citizens are in danger,

11:42.832 --> 11:45.748
or when no other officers
of equal or higher rank

11:45.792 --> 11:47.794
are present
to mitigate this threat.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.448
May I ask under which
contingency you are here?

11:50.492 --> 11:52.755
All of them.

11:55.802 --> 11:59.762
I see where the Federation
puts its pennies.

11:59.806 --> 12:03.592
Do not covet thy neighbor's
starship, Commander.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.942
Besides, we've got
the new uniforms.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.770
And lovely uniforms
they are, Captain.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.598
Very colorful.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.818
Over the past 24 hours,
Federation sensors picked up

12:11.861 --> 12:13.167
seven red bursts spread out

12:13.210 --> 12:15.212
across more than
30,000 light-years.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.388
They appeared in
perfect synchronization

12:17.432 --> 12:18.781
just long enough for
us to get a reading

12:18.825 --> 12:20.652
and then, just as
suddenly, disappeared.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.132
Except for one.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.178
Such precise synchronization
all but rules out

12:24.221 --> 12:25.788
the chaos
of natural phenomena.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.790
Are they some kind of signal?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.923
That's what we're calling
it, but I'll leave the rest

12:29.966 --> 12:32.664
to my science officer.
Your ball, Connolly.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.231
The signals don't seem
to be moons, stars

12:34.275 --> 12:35.667
or any other type of planetoid.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.714
Truth is, we can't detect
anything about them

12:38.758 --> 12:39.976
or engage with them in any way.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.717
Every time we tried to scan,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.501
the computer went haywire.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.155
Like a compass at
the North Pole.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.678
PIKE:
Well put.

12:46.722 --> 12:49.812
Why didn't we think
of that, Connolly? Huh?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.988
Think of all the syllables
that gave their lives.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.208
The metaphor seemed
a bit simplistic.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.210
I believe it's a simile.

12:56.253 --> 12:59.822
Then I owe you a
simile, Commander...?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.955
Burnham. Michael Burnham.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.435
He said you were smart.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.047
We have someone in common.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.918
Yes, I'm aware.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.920
Mr. Spock.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.096
I was expecting to see him.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.578
Sometimes it's wise to keep
our expectations low, Commander.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.798
That way
we're never disappointed.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.455
Excuse me.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.327
Excuse me.Excuse me.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.285
Excuse me.Linus.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.463
You okay? You look a little...

13:32.507 --> 13:34.335
Yes.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.511
I hear it's going around.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.346
Perhaps the signals
are a temporal anomaly.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.478
A tear in the fabric
of space-time.

13:47.522 --> 13:50.438
Black holes can also cause
similar distortions.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.743
Not to this degree.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.311
Six hours ago the signal
stabilized long enough

13:54.355 --> 13:56.009
for us to get a fix
on its position.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.315
PIKE: We were on our way to its
coordinates when suddenly, boom.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.101
Enterprisesuffered multiple
catastrophic systems failures.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.103
Starfleet is sending a team
to tow it to Spacedock

14:03.146 --> 14:04.539
for a full diagnostic.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.758
I'll kindly need
your command codes, Mr. Saru.

14:06.802 --> 14:07.890
I cannot do that.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.370
Pardon me?

14:09.413 --> 14:10.675
"Starship command shall
not be transferred

14:10.719 --> 14:12.068
"without DNA authentication

14:12.112 --> 14:14.201
witnessed by the
entire bridge crew."

14:14.244 --> 14:16.420
It is standard operating
procedure since the war.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.467
O-Of course it is.
Yes, of course.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.817
Bless you.

14:28.650 --> 14:31.044
Okay, Captain Pike.

14:31.087 --> 14:34.264
Stand by for verification.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.266
Um, I'm-I'm Ensign Sylvia Tilly.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.833
I'm-I'm Discovery's
newest addition

14:37.877 --> 14:40.401
to Starfleet's
Command Training Program.Hi.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.229
Yeah, you have really
beautiful nail beds.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.796
Thank you.You're welcome.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.450
Oh, I know what's wrong.
Uh, your pinkie is, um...

14:46.494 --> 14:49.714
It's
just really weird

14:49.758 --> 14:51.412
to say "pinkie"
to a captain.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.936
It's not a very
authoritative finger,

14:53.980 --> 14:55.416
but, um, you know,

14:55.459 --> 14:56.721
it's not on the right pad.
Do-- Can I...?

15:00.116 --> 15:01.422
Kidding.
Oh, my God.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.902
I thought I broke
a captain.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.468
Sorry. I-I don't understand.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.470
All the pertinent
information should be, uh...

15:06.514 --> 15:08.429
There. Oh, God. I'm...

15:08.472 --> 15:09.952
That's your file.
I'm sorry, sir. I...

15:09.996 --> 15:11.519
PIKE:
That's all right, Ensign.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.564
Everybody, grab a seat.
Go ahead.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.698
I want you all
to give that a read.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.396
I'm Captain Christopher Pike.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.312
Up there are my commendations,

15:22.356 --> 15:24.967
my diagnosis
of childhood asthma.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.926
Ah, he big red "F,"

15:26.969 --> 15:30.190
that was my failing grade in
astrophysics at the Academy.

15:31.539 --> 15:34.107
I know this is a hard left turn.

15:34.150 --> 15:37.371
You were en route to Vulcan
to pick up a new captain.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.590
I was briefed on
the classified details

15:39.634 --> 15:42.202
surrounding your last one.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.161
I know he betrayed this crew.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.383
If I were you, I'd have my
doubts about me as well.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.429
But I'm not him.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.085
I'm not Lorca.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.614
The Federation's hackles are up.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.008
I don't have to remind you that
the last time we investigated

16:06.052 --> 16:07.967
a previously unknown
energy distortion,

16:08.010 --> 16:09.403
it resulted in the Klingon war.

16:09.446 --> 16:13.276
These mysterious signals

16:13.320 --> 16:14.538
are unlike anything
we've encountered.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.236
The energy needed
to create them

16:16.279 --> 16:19.108
is beyond anything
we understand.

16:19.152 --> 16:22.546
Is it a greeting?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.505
A declaration of malice?

16:24.548 --> 16:26.246
That's why they put me
on the Discovery

16:26.289 --> 16:28.030
when the Enterprisewent down;

16:28.074 --> 16:29.423
nobody wanted to wait
to find out.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.555
But right now,
this little dot

16:31.599 --> 16:35.646
is the only one willing
to tell us where it is.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.388
Helm, plug in the coordinates.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.390
Let's pay a visit.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.913
Warp factor five.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.002
Aye, sir.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.448
With your permission,
Commander Saru.

16:54.491 --> 16:57.973
The ship is yours, Captain.

17:01.237 --> 17:04.588
All right, then.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.723
Hit it.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.846
Do you hear that?

17:44.889 --> 17:48.110
I sent you my favorite aria
so that you would reconsider

17:48.154 --> 17:51.157
your wildly lame position
on Kasseelian opera.

17:51.200 --> 17:57.032
And to add insult to injury,
I got us actual tickets.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.642
I know. I know you
say you hate it,

17:58.686 --> 18:03.430
and that you only
do it for me, but...

18:03.473 --> 18:08.174
I do love it when you
only do things for me.

18:08.217 --> 18:11.394
I love it.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.092
All right.
I'll see you later.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.354
TILLY:
Commander?

18:14.397 --> 18:17.313
Commander Stamets?

18:17.357 --> 18:19.098
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.795
Um, given our new mission,

18:20.838 --> 18:22.362
I've been assigned
as Command Program Trainee

18:22.405 --> 18:25.191
to manage the reallocation
of the ship's resources.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.931
The spore drive...I finally understand

18:26.975 --> 18:30.370
why Hugh was so enamored
with Kasseelian opera.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.502
Oh.

18:32.546 --> 18:36.158
The tonal matrices
woven together...

18:36.202 --> 18:39.030
the weird rapture between
instruments and voice...

18:39.074 --> 18:41.337
Hugh said
it would reach me.

18:41.381 --> 18:45.863
And he was right... as usual.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.607
Um, so since the spore drive
is inactive, um,

18:50.651 --> 18:53.828
the-the, uh, the engine room
is, um, being converted

18:53.871 --> 18:56.135
back into a standard, uh,
engineering workspace

18:56.178 --> 18:58.137
until Disco's up
and jumping again.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.529
Um, I did notice
that they neglected

18:59.573 --> 19:01.401
to assign you a new lab.

19:01.444 --> 19:04.317
But then I remembered
Brianna in Logic Sciences

19:04.360 --> 19:06.580
has two stories on the third
level, and then it hits me,

19:06.623 --> 19:08.364
"Why does she need
all that space?"

19:08.408 --> 19:10.279
Logic science is
basically meditation.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.063
I mean, I've never
seen the woman move.

19:12.107 --> 19:15.893
So I put her in a utility closet
on 12 and I put you in there.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.460
I'm drunk on power.

19:17.504 --> 19:22.509
Thanks, Tilly,
but it isn't necessary.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.641
Well, what do you want me to do
with your equipment?

19:24.685 --> 19:26.295
Just put it in storage.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.254
No, really.

19:29.646 --> 19:33.955
After the peace accord in Paris,

19:33.998 --> 19:36.523
the Vulcan Science Academy
offered me

19:36.566 --> 19:39.526
a permanent teaching position.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.702
I said yes.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.487
W-Wh-- You're gonna stay
on Vulcan?

19:44.531 --> 19:45.880
But what about the, uh,
network?

19:45.923 --> 19:47.316
You have it by the tail.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.970
You have so much more
to accomplish.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.973
Did you know that
a Kasseelian prima donna

19:52.016 --> 19:55.150
trains her whole life
for one performance?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.632
And after she hits
that last high "E,"

19:58.675 --> 20:02.331
she plunges a dagger
into her own chest and dies?

20:02.375 --> 20:06.466
She's lived an entire
lifetime in that last note.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.730
And I've lived
an entire lifetime

20:09.773 --> 20:12.123
in what I've accomplished here,
on Discovery.

20:12.167 --> 20:15.518
But what about...?Hugh is everywhere I look,
Tilly.

20:17.564 --> 20:20.610
How much am I supposed to take?

20:23.918 --> 20:28.314
Starfleet approved
my transfer.

20:28.357 --> 20:32.666
It's been postponed until the
completion of Pike's mission.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.538
Sir, I just have
to tell you that, um,

20:35.582 --> 20:38.628
I understand that this place
may be haunted for you,

20:38.672 --> 20:40.935
but maybe it's good haunted,

20:40.978 --> 20:43.894
maybe living with ghosts
and energies that are bigger

20:43.938 --> 20:46.593
than we are is why
you love science.

20:46.636 --> 20:49.204
Tilly. You are...

20:52.251 --> 20:54.427
...incandescent.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.125
You're going to become
a magnificent captain

20:57.168 --> 21:00.694
because you do
everything out of love.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.348
But...

21:02.391 --> 21:05.655
I need you to repeat after me.

21:05.699 --> 21:06.613
Okay.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.224
"I will say..."I will say...

21:09.268 --> 21:10.486
"... fewer things."

21:10.530 --> 21:12.271
...fewer thing-- Okay.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.666
I don't want you to go.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.464
AMANDA:
"'Would you tell me, please,

21:31.507 --> 21:35.424
"which way I ought to go
from here?'

21:35.468 --> 21:38.253
"'That depends a good deal on
where you want to get to,'

21:38.297 --> 21:42.170
"said the Cat.

21:42.213 --> 21:46.043
"'I don't care much where,'
said Alice.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.480
"'Then it doesn't matter

21:47.523 --> 21:51.527
which way you go,'
said the Cat."

21:51.571 --> 21:54.661
Which way do you want to go?

21:56.489 --> 21:58.752
Home. To Earth.

22:04.105 --> 22:07.587
I'm gonna take you there
someday, sweetheart.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.769
Door.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.510
May I enter?

22:17.553 --> 22:22.079
Yes, of course.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.734
SAREK:
It would appear the human
proverb is accurate:

22:24.778 --> 22:27.868
old habits die hard.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.522
Or they never die at all.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.399
I wasn't aware you knew
Amanda read Aliceto me.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.489
While I was often occupied
by work in the evenings,

22:40.533 --> 22:44.580
it did not prevent my listening
from upstairs.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.104
Her voice gave comfort
to us both.

22:48.628 --> 22:51.587
I will be leaving Discovery

22:51.631 --> 22:53.328
as soon as we drop out of warp.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.592
Vulcan High Command has asked
that I work with Starfleet

22:56.636 --> 22:58.594
in assembling
a Federation task force.

22:58.638 --> 23:01.597
These signals
must be deciphered,

23:01.641 --> 23:04.470
and the timing must be
considered, so soon after a war.

23:04.513 --> 23:05.601
Do you think they're related?

23:05.645 --> 23:06.689
Could the Klingons be involved?

23:06.733 --> 23:08.691
No.

23:08.735 --> 23:11.912
I reached out to
High Chancellor L'Rell.

23:11.955 --> 23:14.088
The Klingons have seen
the signals, too,

23:14.131 --> 23:16.612
and they have no explanation
for them, either.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.185
Why do you think
he didn't come on board?

23:24.228 --> 23:27.710
Undoubtedly, Spock
has devoted himself

23:27.754 --> 23:30.017
to brining the
Enterpriseback on line.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.454
There's more to it than that.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.678
How long has it been
since you spoke to him?

23:38.721 --> 23:40.462
Years.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.464
Me, too.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.997
When I first came to you,

23:54.041 --> 23:57.000
I-I know that you considered
every possible effect

23:57.044 --> 24:01.657
a Vulcan education,
a Vulcan life,

24:01.701 --> 24:04.791
might have on a human child.

24:07.054 --> 24:10.449
What did you want Spock
to learn from me?

24:10.492 --> 24:14.453
Empathy.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.672
Something he would need
to understand

24:16.716 --> 24:19.196
to successfully interact
with humans.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.853
Wouldn't he have learned this
from our mother?

24:23.897 --> 24:28.336
Spock has great reverence
for his mother.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.164
But reverence tends to...

24:30.207 --> 24:32.906
Fill up the room.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.517
Indeed.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.477
So from a peer,

24:38.520 --> 24:41.784
a sibling, you thought...

24:41.828 --> 24:44.308
Yes.

24:44.352 --> 24:47.486
But I do not think
I was successful.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.576
I do not think he ever
fully accepted you.

24:57.365 --> 25:00.194
He may have.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.978
For a time.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.679
Just a time?

25:06.722 --> 25:10.291
I'm discouraged he did not
embrace the lesson.

25:12.728 --> 25:17.559
Father, I am confident that
empathy is very real for Spock.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.867
I can hear the
missing notes, Michael.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.869
There is something
about your relationship

25:22.912 --> 25:25.088
you're not sharing.

25:25.132 --> 25:29.005
It weighs on you.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.965
Despite my departure,

25:32.008 --> 25:33.836
I will avail myself to you,

25:33.880 --> 25:38.449
should you choose to
speak of it someday.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.495
Thank you.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.545
In the meantime,
I suggest you focus

25:46.588 --> 25:50.374
on the problem in front of you,
rather than what is behind.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.816
DETMER:
We're approaching the signal's
coordinates, Captain.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.469
PIKE:
Acknowledged.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.167
Bridge crew,
give me a roll call.

26:02.473 --> 26:03.910
Lord knows what's waiting
for us down there.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.868
I want to know who
I'm facing it with. Sound off.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.261
And skip your ranks,
they don't matter.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.697
Clockwise from Science.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.090
Michael Burnham.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.787
Evan Connolly.

26:11.831 --> 26:12.788
Gen Rhys.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.355
Keyla Detmer.

26:14.398 --> 26:15.443
Joann Owosekun.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.792
Lieutenant Commander Airiam.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.228
Ronald Altman Bryce.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.926
Saru.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.972
Just Saru.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.800
PIKE: All right.
Rhys, charge phaser cannons.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.760
Bryce, start transmitting
standard Federation greeting.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.458
Owosekun, Saru, Connolly,
Burnham, scan what you can.

26:30.501 --> 26:33.983
Detmer... fly good.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.637
BRIDGE CREW:
Aye, Captain.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.465
Yellow Alert.
Drop us out of warp.

26:40.381 --> 26:41.730
I'm detecting something.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.172
How close was that?700 meters.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.971
I was expecting a red thing.
Where's my damn red thing?

27:05.014 --> 27:06.625
All sensors are
at maximum power.

27:06.668 --> 27:07.887
There's no sign
of the original signal

27:07.930 --> 27:09.018
or any object that might
have generated it.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.541
As if it were a mirage.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.934
All right, let's ID
what nearly T-boned us.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.936
See if it can provide
any answers.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.895
It appears to be an
interstellar asteroid

27:15.938 --> 27:18.027
traveling at 5,000
kilometers per second.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.594
BURNHAM:
Sir, the point
of near impact

27:19.638 --> 27:21.248
was the exact coordinates
of the signal.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.467
Well, that's interesting.
Chase it, Detmer.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.165
Chasing, sir.What do the scans tell us?

27:25.208 --> 27:26.296
There's interference from
a hyper-dense cloud

27:26.340 --> 27:27.341
of charged particles.

27:27.384 --> 27:28.908
This rock has an atmosphere.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.039
How? It isn't large enough
to generate

27:30.083 --> 27:31.258
a sufficient gravity field.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.827
DETMER:
Not so sure about that.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.872
We just splashed into
a deep gravity well

27:36.916 --> 27:38.352
that appears to be
rapidly fluctuating.

27:38.395 --> 27:39.919
Okay. I want to know
what's down there.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.747
Suggestion. Discoveryhas
telescopic cameras

27:41.790 --> 27:43.792
to help aid in hull repairs.

27:43.836 --> 27:46.142
We point them at the asteroid
and capture images.Love it. Do it.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.150
Images are coming in,
but closer is better.

27:54.194 --> 27:57.023
Increase to one-quarter impulse.Accelerating one-quarter, sir.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.508
Report!
DETMER:
We just pushed apart

28:04.552 --> 28:06.206
like two similarly charged
magnets.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.643
I've never experienced
anything like it.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.080
Our interaction has changed
the object's trajectory.

28:11.124 --> 28:13.735
It is now on a collision course
with a pulsar.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.998
Time to incineration:
five hours.

28:16.042 --> 28:19.088
There's a Starfleet vessel
down there.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.136
On screen.

28:25.225 --> 28:28.097
BURNHAM:
I picked up a strange chasm
cutting across

28:28.141 --> 28:29.969
the ice field of
the asteroid's surface.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.971
They crash-landed.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.276
Hail them, Bryce.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.889
Absolutely no response, Captain.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.891
There's no way to zoom in
any further.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.806
Commander Saru,

28:40.849 --> 28:43.417
I know your vision has a larger
optical window than ours.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.853
Can you make out
the registry number?

28:44.897 --> 28:49.249
N-C-C dash 8-1-5.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.641
A medical frigate.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.035
Running it.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.863
The USS Hiawatha,

28:54.907 --> 28:56.299
thought destroyed
by the Klingons ten months ago.

28:56.343 --> 28:58.214
Any life signs?

28:58.258 --> 29:00.086
Still impossible
to scan, sir.

29:00.129 --> 29:03.263
The asteroid's temperature is
negative 120 degrees Celsius.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.134
Helm, stay on their tail.

29:05.178 --> 29:08.137
Prep a landing party.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.447
Is there any location on that
asteroid that we can beam to?

29:13.490 --> 29:15.797
Negative. The cloud
of charged particles

29:15.841 --> 29:17.320
will disrupt transporter
signals.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.931
Without pattern enhancers,

29:18.974 --> 29:21.194
transport to and from
the asteroid is too dangerous.

29:21.237 --> 29:23.544
A shuttle?RHYS: The unpredictable
gravity fields

29:23.587 --> 29:24.937
would make landing impossible,
sir.If there's anybody down there,

29:24.980 --> 29:27.026
I'm not leaving them there
to die.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.637
It is my duty to articulate
that the odds of survival

29:29.680 --> 29:31.682
in a crashed ship on one of
the most hostile environments

29:31.726 --> 29:34.033
in space are unlikely,

29:34.076 --> 29:36.339
and risking more crew
to confirm that fact,

29:36.383 --> 29:37.471
well, it requires consideration.

29:37.514 --> 29:38.951
I'm considering
that if you're wrong,

29:38.994 --> 29:40.866
we've got less than five hours
to get them out.

29:40.909 --> 29:42.171
BURNHAM:
Landing on an asteroid traveling

29:42.215 --> 29:43.825
at 5,000 kilometers per second

29:43.869 --> 29:45.348
with spotty telemetry
and no transporter...

29:45.392 --> 29:48.395
I know what it is, Commander.

29:51.659 --> 29:54.880
I didn't sit out the war with
my crew just to stand down now.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.099
Listen, I don't mind dissenting
opinions, I really don't,

29:57.143 --> 29:59.101
but they have
to come with solutions.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.538
Yes. I have one.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.453
That's what I was trying
to offer.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.455
And for the record,

30:05.499 --> 30:08.502
there is not a single person
on this bridge who would abandon

30:08.545 --> 30:12.071
a Starfleet brother
or sister... sir.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.167
Right there with you.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.300
What did you have in mind?

30:24.344 --> 30:26.302
We have less than two hours
to fly down

30:26.346 --> 30:28.087
to the asteroid's surface
and search for survivors,

30:28.130 --> 30:29.828
then set up pattern enhancers
and beam back.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.482
Unless our signals get caught up
in all that E.M. distortion

30:32.526 --> 30:34.484
and we rematerialize
in a billion pieces.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.312
You want out, Connolly?
Now's the time.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.575
Not a chance, sir.
I love roller coasters.

30:38.619 --> 30:41.448
What about you, Burnham?I'm not uncomfortable with risk.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.667
Get your red shirt into a EV
suit, Nhan. You're with us.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.495
Can't wait, sir.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.019
Hey, I need a sample
of that asteroid.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.934
I was down in engineering
during the flyby, right?

30:48.977 --> 30:50.892
I noticed that all the spores
started going crazy

30:50.936 --> 30:52.502
the closer we got.

30:52.546 --> 30:53.895
It-it may be a coincidence,

30:53.939 --> 30:55.505
but I haven't seen a
mycelial energy spike

30:55.549 --> 30:57.159
like this since the Tardigrade.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.858
Stamets must be
having a field day.

30:59.901 --> 31:03.122
Um... Stamets is transferring
off the ship.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.472
And if you ask me
any more questions,

31:05.515 --> 31:08.040
I'm gonna start crying like
a baby Tribble in the kill zone.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.693
Promise you'll be coming back,

31:09.737 --> 31:11.565
'cause I can't lose
two people in one day.

31:13.393 --> 31:16.004
That's right. You can't
promise that. Um, lie to me?

31:17.658 --> 31:19.790
I'm coming back, Tilly.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.538
COMPUTER:
All non-essential personnel,

31:28.582 --> 31:30.540
please clear
main shuttle bay immediately.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.372
MALE :
Landing pod one,

31:36.416 --> 31:38.418
stand by for launch prep.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.639
MALE 2: Landing pod four,
stand by for launch prep.

31:44.598 --> 31:48.297
MALE 3: Landing pod two,
five minute check complete.

31:50.647 --> 31:53.824
MALE 4: Landing pod pilots,
you are clear to board.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.526
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.269
Launch stations
one through four engaged.

32:03.312 --> 32:05.706
COMPUTER: Pod Control, stand by
to commence launch initiation.

32:05.749 --> 32:08.535
POD COMPUTER:
Auto navigation system on line.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.581
These lander pods were developed
for a mission to Kim-Tara.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.279
It has similar
gravimetric conditions.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.542
You've flown 'em before,
Burnham?BURNHAM: Yes, sir.

32:15.585 --> 32:18.501
I was one of the test pilots.
Nine Gs for 11 minutes.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.982
Okeydoke.
Then you're in the lead.Copy that.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.593
Maintaining for 11 minutes seems
like a bit of a stretch.

32:23.637 --> 32:26.335
For some of us, maybe.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.555
PIKE: Okay, guys.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.731
MALE :
Final system check complete.Bridge,

32:30.774 --> 32:33.081
launch sequence confirm.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.083
Thrusters ready on my mark.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.737
Launch in five...

32:36.780 --> 32:40.088
four... three... two...

32:40.132 --> 32:42.134
one.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.026
We got debris.No shit.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.768
POD COMPUTER:
Auto navigation confirmed.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.435
I don't like those thermals.

33:22.478 --> 33:23.697
The rock's under
so much pressure

33:23.740 --> 33:25.220
that when the gravity
field fluctuates,

33:25.264 --> 33:26.787
the debris inflates.You mean explodes?

33:31.879 --> 33:33.794
Really? Are you surprised?

33:33.837 --> 33:36.753
I'm not detecting any pattern to
these energy field detonations.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.842
Magnetics are messing
with my nav computer.

33:38.886 --> 33:41.323
I'm peaking, too.
Switch to manual navigation.

33:41.367 --> 33:42.716
I'm losing control.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.239
These pods are built
for this, Nhan.

33:44.283 --> 33:45.545
Just take the stick manually.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.199
You mean manuallymanually?

33:56.208 --> 33:57.731
Connolly,
your field is too wide.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.950
Watch the boulders
in lateral grid six.

33:59.994 --> 34:02.997
Burnham's right.
Tuck in behind her.No, she's not, sir.

34:11.875 --> 34:12.963
Ooh!

34:13.007 --> 34:14.443
Connolly, I'm telling you

34:14.487 --> 34:15.835
your field is too wide!

34:15.879 --> 34:18.447
Pull back, Lieutenant.
That's an order!

34:18.491 --> 34:20.275
Sir, she didn't alter
the computer's flight patterns

34:20.319 --> 34:22.842
to adjust for the gravitational
fluctuations. I've got this.

34:22.886 --> 34:25.106
You can't rely on sensors!

34:25.150 --> 34:26.716
Don't question my calculations.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.501
My roommate at the academy
was part Caitian.

34:28.543 --> 34:31.069
And she was a year ahead of me,
Burnham, but I told her

34:31.112 --> 34:33.288
what I'll tell you--
just relax and let me do...

34:35.681 --> 34:36.770
No!

34:36.813 --> 34:39.164
Connolly?!

34:40.252 --> 34:41.775
Pod three is down.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.907
Pod two has sustained
structural damage.

34:43.951 --> 34:47.215
Navigation is off-line.

34:47.259 --> 34:50.088
POD COMPUTER:
Structural integrity
compromised.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.742
System failure is imminent.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.614
Initiating ejection sequence.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.098
Warning:
Exo-suit initiation failure.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.012
Auto eject override.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.753
PIKE: Discovery,
I have system-wide failure.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.060
Negative on evac.
I am in total free fall.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.936
Captain Pike,

35:12.980 --> 35:15.374
we are running a remote
diagnostic on your pod now.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.289
It's dead. That's the diagnosis.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.639
3,000 feet to impact.Can you eject?

35:19.682 --> 35:22.424
No. My thruster pack's damaged.
The damn helmet's stuck.

35:27.212 --> 35:30.171
Discovery,can you activate the
captain's ejector seat remotely?

35:30.215 --> 35:32.956
Lot of surface distortion.
I need another 30 seconds.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.958
Without EV boosters,
he'll still be in free fall.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.612
Not if I can catch him.

35:36.656 --> 35:39.224
Forget it, Burnham. I already
lost one officer today.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.226
I'm comfortable
with the risk, sir.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.793
And I'm not. If you screw
this up, we're both dead.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.969
Stay on mission.
That's an order.

35:46.013 --> 35:48.015
2,000 feet till impact.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.849
You need to trust us, sir.
I told you

35:55.892 --> 35:57.851
we don't abandon each other.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.983
Discoveryhas you.

36:00.027 --> 36:01.681
We have him, right, ladies?

36:01.724 --> 36:03.987
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

36:05.250 --> 36:08.078
Do it.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.733
Calculating the burn rate
to stop terminal velocity.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.475
Once I eject, take control
of my thruster and plot

36:13.519 --> 36:14.955
a trajectory to the captain.Working on it.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.870
20 seconds to impact!

36:16.913 --> 36:18.915
BURNHAM:
Nhan, stay on course
to the asteroid's surface.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.700
You'll be fine.
I'm going after the captain.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.181
Copy that.
Go get 'em, Burnham.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.143
I have a lock.Plotting your
trajectory, Burnham.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.101
If this works, you have less
than ten seconds to catch him,

36:31.145 --> 36:32.581
and then
I'll hit your thrusters.

36:32.625 --> 36:35.758
Copy. Get ready
to eject the captain on my mark.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.589
On three.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.112
One.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.723
BOTH:
Two.

36:43.766 --> 36:44.724
ALL THREE:
Three.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.395
Six seconds to impact.

37:03.438 --> 37:07.399
Five. Four.

37:07.442 --> 37:08.965
Three.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.838
Two. One.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.796
Initiating maximum thrust!

37:23.719 --> 37:26.113
Burnham?

37:28.855 --> 37:31.031
Burnham, do you copy?

37:34.904 --> 37:38.908
Discovery,this is Burnham.
We have touchdown.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.666
BURNHAM:
There's a ton of interference.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.320
Tilly was right.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.931
The asteroid's energy density
is off the charts.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.151
We need to get her a sample
for analysis.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.196
PIKE:
My God.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.158
COMPUTER :
Red alert. Red...

38:13.291 --> 38:14.770
COMPUTER:
Perimeter red alert.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.642
Collision imminent.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.277
Man, they came down hard.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.758
Titanium. Snapped in half.

38:45.801 --> 38:48.804
The gravitational field
was probably

38:48.848 --> 38:50.980
ten times stronger
when they landed.

38:54.244 --> 38:57.726
I have an incoming target.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.405
BURNHAM:
It's made from scavenged
Starfleet tech.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.189
I see navigation parts.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.720
PIKE: Looks like
multi-vector propulsions.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.766
Inertial dampeners, too.
This design is...

39:37.810 --> 39:39.986
FEMALE:
Awesome. I know. I built them.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.248
You're welcome.

39:46.166 --> 39:50.866
FEMALE:
Don't just stand there.
Follow the kids. Come on!

40:14.412 --> 40:17.240
BURNHAM:
Are we breathable here?

40:17.284 --> 40:20.896
FEMALE:
Yup. Ditch your helmets,
and keep her coming.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.383
Stop! Look down.

40:32.038 --> 40:35.084
I don't have time
for you to get decapitated.

41:12.861 --> 41:15.951
Oh, thank Christ
you guys are here.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.781
I'm Commander Jett Reno,
Engineering.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.435
I'd shake your hand, but

41:21.479 --> 41:24.090
I'm up to my elbow
in Tellarite brains.

41:24.133 --> 41:28.964
Captain Christopher Pike
of the USS Discovery.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.749
This is Commander Burnham
and Commander Nhan.

41:30.792 --> 41:33.229
Yeah. I saw the
Federation insignia.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.144
It's why I didn't
vaporize you.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.450
Who were you expecting?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.365
Are you kidding? Maybe
someone with a bat'leth?

41:38.408 --> 41:40.410
Never need to see
another one of those

41:40.454 --> 41:42.630
for the rest of my damn life.

41:42.674 --> 41:47.026
Ugh. Grek's head wound keeps
opening up, poor guy.

41:47.069 --> 41:50.551
Nice to meet ya.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.989
Relax. Tellarite blood's rich
in hemerythrin.

41:54.033 --> 41:55.469
The only place on Earth
you'll find anything

41:55.513 --> 41:57.427
like it is marine
invertebrates.

41:57.471 --> 42:00.779
Evolution's a fickle
bitch, am I right?

42:00.822 --> 42:02.955
How long have you...?Ten months, 11 days.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.870
Remind me never to get stranded

42:04.913 --> 42:06.785
in enemy space
with a war raging.

42:06.828 --> 42:10.136
Commander Reno, the war's over.

42:16.577 --> 42:20.059
No one's speaking Klingon,
so... we won?

42:20.102 --> 42:23.845
There was an armistice.
We're at peace.

42:23.889 --> 42:26.152
An armistice with the guys
who drink bloodwine?

42:26.195 --> 42:27.327
Yes.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.505
Hear that, Valentine?

42:31.549 --> 42:33.681
The war's over.
We're going home.

42:33.725 --> 42:35.117
Valentine took
a piece of shrapnel

42:35.161 --> 42:37.119
to the left aortic valve.

42:37.163 --> 42:40.209
Needed a transplant, but didn't
have a donor, so I piggybacked

42:40.253 --> 42:42.647
his heart to a dead Bolian
to keep it ticking.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.649
You're an engineer,
not a surgeon.

42:44.692 --> 42:47.129
Body's just a machine,
and I read.

42:47.173 --> 42:50.698
Commander, you kept all of these
officers alive by yourself?

42:50.742 --> 42:53.701
The kids helped. I built them
to handle a lot of weight.

42:53.745 --> 42:55.703
When I suspended
the counterweights,

42:55.747 --> 42:58.010
they hung me upside down
like a bat.

42:59.707 --> 43:01.056
When were you shot down?

43:01.100 --> 43:03.189
On the way to Starbase 36.

43:03.232 --> 43:05.800
We got most of the war-wounded
into escape pods,

43:05.844 --> 43:08.281
but this batch was too critical
to move.

43:08.324 --> 43:11.806
And you stayed behind?Of course I stayed behind. What
the hell would you have done?

43:11.850 --> 43:14.200
Admittedly,
not the brightest move.

43:16.811 --> 43:19.988
We've been rocking
and rolling for hours.

43:20.032 --> 43:21.294
Can someone tell me
what's going on?

43:21.337 --> 43:22.817
This asteroid is

43:22.861 --> 43:24.384
on a collision course
with a pulsar.

43:24.427 --> 43:26.168
The gravitational field is
gonna tear this place apart.

43:26.212 --> 43:28.780
Uh. What a relief.
Thought we were all gonna die.

43:28.823 --> 43:31.521
Can you get us
the hell out of here, or what?

43:31.565 --> 43:33.393
We're damn sure gonna try.

43:33.436 --> 43:36.048
The pads are still intact.

43:36.091 --> 43:38.790
Can we move your patients?Dicey, but yeah.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.052
Ready.

43:40.095 --> 43:41.662
Set up the enhancers
around the ship--

43:41.706 --> 43:43.708
widest perimeter possible--
then meet us at sickbay.

43:43.751 --> 43:45.274
Got it.

43:46.928 --> 43:49.496
We're in business.

43:51.324 --> 43:54.066
Why are we moving them if you're
creating an enhancement field

43:54.109 --> 43:56.198
big enough to beam
from anywhere on the ship?

43:56.242 --> 43:58.287
The enhancers are
just a backup in case

43:58.331 --> 44:00.202
the Hiawatha'smain transporter
doesn't stay on line.

44:00.246 --> 44:03.118
Ship-to-ship beaming on the pads
is far more reliable, and it'll

44:03.162 --> 44:05.251
be safer for your patients.
See if you can get that one up.

44:05.294 --> 44:07.645
Where the hell were you
ten months ago?

44:07.688 --> 44:10.517
Commander, do you know anything
about the signal?

44:10.560 --> 44:12.301
What signal?

44:12.345 --> 44:16.305
Well, we found you by tracking
the coordinates of a signal,

44:16.349 --> 44:18.351
one of seven.

44:18.394 --> 44:21.659
Turned up
straight out of nowhere.

44:21.702 --> 44:23.269
I don't know anything about it.

44:26.881 --> 44:28.230
Once the perimeter's set,

44:28.274 --> 44:30.276
we can start beaming them out
six at a time.

44:30.319 --> 44:32.800
Enhancement field is on line!

44:32.844 --> 44:34.846
PIKE:
Let's go! Let's go!

44:36.195 --> 44:39.198
We have transporter signal, sir.

44:39.241 --> 44:42.027
Proximity alert, sir.

44:42.070 --> 44:44.159
The debris is getting worse.

44:48.163 --> 44:51.340
If the transporters are up,
then we have no shields.

44:51.384 --> 44:52.994
Yellow alert! Evasive maneuvers!

45:01.263 --> 45:02.569
Starboard impact!

45:02.612 --> 45:04.136
That asteroid will not hold
together much longer.

45:04.179 --> 45:06.573
Comms, notify Dr. Pollard
and have her team ready

45:06.616 --> 45:08.618
to receive survivors
in the transporter room.

45:15.321 --> 45:17.366
Come on, come on, come on.

45:26.201 --> 45:27.899
Yes.

45:27.942 --> 45:30.466
RHYS: The first wave of patients
are aboard, Captain.

45:30.510 --> 45:31.946
Keep us in transporter range.

45:36.777 --> 45:40.433
Pike to Discovery.Standing
by for final transport.

45:41.782 --> 45:43.001
Rerouting power.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.359
Burnham, let's go.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.321
Burnha--

46:05.023 --> 46:07.329
Discovery,if you can hear me,

46:07.373 --> 46:08.940
track my signal.

46:09.984 --> 46:12.378
Helmet!

48:02.967 --> 48:04.577
Are you all right?Yeah.

48:04.620 --> 48:06.361
Pike to Discovery.
Get us out of here.

48:06.405 --> 48:07.536
Wait!

48:24.945 --> 48:26.904
Oh. Excuse me.

48:26.947 --> 48:29.167
Excuse me. S-Sorry.

48:33.127 --> 48:34.824
Are you okay?

48:34.868 --> 48:37.653
Femoral shaft fracture.
Dr. Pollard said I'd be up

48:37.697 --> 48:38.916
on my feet in two hours.

48:38.959 --> 48:40.526
It's okay if you forgot
the sample. I--

48:40.569 --> 48:42.093
The only thing I care
about coming back is you.

48:42.136 --> 48:44.486
Tilly, I-I had it, in my hand.

48:44.530 --> 48:47.576
But when I beamed out, the
transporter didn't get a lock.

48:47.620 --> 48:50.318
Then that would mean
that the asteroid

48:50.362 --> 48:53.539
is not entirely comprised
of baryonic matter.Right.

48:53.582 --> 48:55.715
Could mean that Discoveryis...
touching something

48:55.758 --> 48:57.064
impossible. Yeah.Impossible.

48:57.108 --> 48:59.066
A-a bridge to a
potentially unlimited

48:59.110 --> 49:02.069
and-and 100%-efficient
energy source.

49:02.113 --> 49:04.071
A new branch of science
could be sprouting before us,

49:04.115 --> 49:06.073
and we are its founding mothers.

49:06.117 --> 49:07.640
It would explain the volatile
gravitational energy.

49:07.683 --> 49:09.816
I-I need to...Get that sample

49:09.859 --> 49:11.557
before it's swallowed up by
that pulsar. Now, the asteroid

49:11.600 --> 49:13.385
has been shedding rocks
all over the place.

49:13.428 --> 49:14.603
I mapped several
of their trajectories.

49:14.647 --> 49:16.127
We still have time
to reach one of them.

49:16.170 --> 49:17.606
This is what you've been doing
since you were rescued?

49:17.650 --> 49:18.607
You're supposed
to be recovering.

49:18.651 --> 49:20.087
I'm a terrible patient.

49:20.131 --> 49:21.828
I second that.

49:21.871 --> 49:24.744
67 minutes until
vaporization.

49:24.787 --> 49:26.441
Go.

49:28.139 --> 49:29.401
Tilly to Engineering.

49:29.444 --> 49:30.489
Get me a gravity simulator

49:30.532 --> 49:32.621
and meet me
in the shuttle bay now.

49:36.016 --> 49:38.540
The bridge is standing by
and ready to receive.

49:38.584 --> 49:40.542
Is there a flux coupler
in the crate?

49:40.586 --> 49:42.544
We need it to activate
the power relays.

49:42.588 --> 49:44.155
Something like this?

49:44.198 --> 49:46.679
What are you
doing here?Well, that depends.

49:46.722 --> 49:49.595
Are you attempting to capture
an asteroid, Ensign Tilly?

49:49.638 --> 49:51.640
Uh, just a little piece.
If my theory's correct,

49:51.684 --> 49:53.642
we'll be able to interact
with dark matter, sir.

49:53.686 --> 49:55.862
Well, I'm offended I
wasn't invited to the party.

49:55.905 --> 49:57.646
Oh, my-- oh my, God,
you're so invited.

49:57.690 --> 49:59.431
Everybody clear!

50:03.565 --> 50:05.611
TILLY: Gravity simulator
is on line, Captain.

50:05.654 --> 50:09.180
Copy that, Ensign.
We'll get into position.

50:12.531 --> 50:14.837
Mr. Saru.

50:16.839 --> 50:19.233
My mission has ended.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.541
I believe this one's yours.

50:23.629 --> 50:26.023
Thank you, Captain.

50:28.808 --> 50:30.636
Lieutenant Detmer,
engage your intercept course

50:30.679 --> 50:32.768
and place the asteroid
directly in our wake.

50:32.812 --> 50:34.683
It'd be my pleasure, sir.

50:49.524 --> 50:51.483
This feels bad.

50:51.526 --> 50:54.747
Hold tight.Aft shields at 110% of maximum.

50:54.790 --> 50:56.314
90 seconds
until they overload.

50:56.357 --> 50:58.490
Detmer, pump the brakes.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.112
It's in the bay.

51:12.156 --> 51:13.331
All systems intact.

51:13.374 --> 51:14.332
Good to go, Commander.

51:14.375 --> 51:15.420
Helm, get us out of here.

51:15.463 --> 51:17.770
Shuttle bay, what's your status?

51:19.946 --> 51:22.557
I thought it'd be bigger.Mm.

51:22.601 --> 51:26.996
The shuttle bay needs a little
TLC, but all is well, Commander.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.999
This is the power
of math, people!

51:31.784 --> 51:34.221
Come on!You are correct, Ensign.

51:43.578 --> 51:45.580
Come in.

51:46.668 --> 51:48.583
Ah.

51:48.627 --> 51:50.846
All better? Can't have
my science officer

51:50.890 --> 51:52.761
walking around looking
like that tower in Pisa.

51:52.805 --> 51:55.590
Dr. Pollard is the definition
of "meticulous."

51:55.634 --> 51:56.852
Mm.

51:56.896 --> 51:58.767
I heard you were staying on
with us.

51:58.811 --> 52:00.639
Oh. Yeah.

52:00.682 --> 52:03.642
The damage to Enterprise
was severe.

52:03.685 --> 52:06.819
Engineering Corps has no idea
when she'll be back on line.

52:07.863 --> 52:10.431
Does Commander Saru know?

52:10.475 --> 52:12.216
Yes.

52:12.259 --> 52:14.435
And we'll treat this like a...

52:14.479 --> 52:16.437
joint custody situation.

52:16.481 --> 52:18.570
He's got a lot
of smart.

52:18.613 --> 52:20.267
And since the Federation
has entrusted Discovery

52:20.311 --> 52:22.704
with determining the source
and intent of those signals,

52:22.748 --> 52:24.619
I need all the smart I can get.

52:25.359 --> 52:26.839
And I need a new
ready room.

52:26.882 --> 52:28.971
: Where the hell
do people sit, huh?

52:29.015 --> 52:30.234
They don't.

52:30.277 --> 52:32.932
Lorca wasn't one
to encourage discourse.

52:32.975 --> 52:34.934
Well,

52:34.977 --> 52:37.110
I want my officers
to feel like they can

52:37.154 --> 52:40.200
pull up a chair
and speak freely.

52:40.244 --> 52:41.854
Why don't we get the hell out
of here, huh?

52:41.897 --> 52:43.116
Come on.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.900
Yes, sir.

52:49.992 --> 52:53.953
Has Spock told you why he and
I don't have a relationship?

52:53.996 --> 52:55.737
No.

52:55.781 --> 52:57.652
Not specifically.

52:57.696 --> 52:59.263
I'm the reason.

53:01.743 --> 53:04.224
I'd like to go
to Enterprise,sir.

53:04.268 --> 53:07.053
To see him.

53:07.096 --> 53:10.317
I'm sorry, Burnham,
but Spock's not there.

53:10.361 --> 53:12.928
He took leave.

53:14.669 --> 53:16.932
Missing the war...

53:16.976 --> 53:19.413
while the Enterprise
was on its five-year mission,

53:19.457 --> 53:21.981
that, uh...

53:22.024 --> 53:25.637
took a toll on my crew,

53:25.680 --> 53:27.769
a toll on Spock.

53:27.813 --> 53:29.815
On me, too.

53:32.165 --> 53:34.254
Even if they had
called you back,

53:34.298 --> 53:36.952
you were so far away, you
wouldn't have made it in time.

53:36.996 --> 53:39.999
Starfleet ordered you
to stay away for a reason.

53:40.042 --> 53:41.914
Enterprisewas an instrument
of last resort.

53:50.705 --> 53:53.578
"What is the logic
in staying away

53:53.621 --> 53:56.842
if there is nothing left
to come back to?"

53:58.191 --> 54:02.151
Spock asked the most
amazing questions.

54:02.195 --> 54:04.066
It's completely logical

54:04.110 --> 54:07.592
yet somehow able to make
everyone see that logic

54:07.635 --> 54:10.856
was the beginning of the
picture and not the end.

54:12.858 --> 54:14.425
He was ahead of all
of us, in that way.

54:17.341 --> 54:21.127
A few months ago,

54:21.170 --> 54:24.348
I... I felt something
shift in him.

54:24.391 --> 54:27.307
It was as if he'd run into
a question he couldn't answer.

54:27.351 --> 54:30.397
He-he didn't want
to share it with me.

54:30.441 --> 54:32.486
With anybody.

54:32.530 --> 54:34.140
And you have no idea
what it might have been?

54:34.183 --> 54:36.316
No. Spock's one
of my bridge officers.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.970
I trust him implicitly.

54:38.013 --> 54:39.928
He asked me for time,
and I gave it to him.

54:39.972 --> 54:41.190
How long will he be gone?

54:41.234 --> 54:42.931
Not sure.

54:42.975 --> 54:45.717
He had months and months
accumulated.

54:53.899 --> 54:57.381
I'd still like to go aboard.

54:57.424 --> 54:59.644
I don't know
what I expect to find,

54:59.687 --> 55:01.341
but...

55:01.385 --> 55:05.084
I need to.

55:05.127 --> 55:07.391
SARU:
Captain Pike to the bridge.

55:10.437 --> 55:12.961
You should go.

55:15.964 --> 55:17.966
And, Burnham...

55:20.273 --> 55:23.232
...wherever our mission
takes us,

55:23.276 --> 55:26.671
we'll try to have a little fun
along the way, too, huh?

55:26.714 --> 55:28.499
Make a little noise.

55:28.542 --> 55:30.152
Ruffle a few feathers.

55:31.197 --> 55:33.330
I look forward to it, Captain.

57:33.232 --> 57:35.364
SPOCK:
Personal log.

57:35.408 --> 57:39.586
As a child, I had what my mother
called nightmares.

57:39.630 --> 57:42.850
She taught me to control my fear
by drawing it,

57:42.894 --> 57:46.071
rendering fear powerless.

57:46.114 --> 57:49.378
The nightmares have returned.

57:49.422 --> 57:52.251
The same vision,
again and again.

57:52.294 --> 57:55.776
I now understand its meaning

57:55.820 --> 57:58.387
and where it must lead me.

57:58.431 --> 57:59.563
In the event of my death,

57:59.606 --> 58:02.043
I have encoded it
within this audio file.

58:02.087 --> 58:06.874
This may be my last entry
aboard the Enterprise.

58:12.576 --> 58:16.231
BURNHAM: There are so many
things I wish I'd said to you,

58:16.275 --> 58:19.278
so many things
I want to say now.

58:58.752 --> 59:00.711
I'm too late, aren't I?

59:00.754 --> 59:02.713
Oh, Spock.

59:02.756 --> 59:06.978
I can only pray
I don't lose you again.

59:10.198 --> 59:11.591
Brother.
