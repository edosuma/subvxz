00:08.834 --> 00:10.500
and they all said positive.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.834
- Wanna tell me who the guy was?
- That doesn't matter.

00:12.834 --> 00:15.542
- How's Travis working out?
- Best server I got.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.667
- Good roommate too.
- I'm sorry.

- I'm sorry.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.542
- That's Noah.
- As in ex-boyfriend Noah?

00:30.542 --> 00:32.165
What about the connection
we have?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.458

I wanna grow old with you.

and a little confusing.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.000
Why did you apply to Lancer?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.125
Oh, I filled out
an application last year

02:46.125 --> 02:49.667
in a moment
of vocational crisis.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.166
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing of it?

02:51.166 --> 02:53.166
I got wait-listed
the first time, you know.

02:53.166 --> 02:56.000
I rolled the application
over this year and...

02:56.000 --> 02:57.834
I don't know, I figured
I'd wait to see how I did

02:57.834 --> 03:01.500

advertising it. What?

I mean, assuming
I get into the program.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.625
Well, I thought
you said you were in.

03:22.625 --> 03:23.667
Well, I'm into the university.

03:23.667 --> 03:24.834

03:24.834 --> 03:25.834

08:51.375 --> 08:52.667
Kathy!

08:54.291 --> 08:55.667
I didn't mean that.

08:57.834 --> 08:59.792
Char?

08:59.792 --> 09:01.667
I-I say stupid things
all the time.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.834
Char!

09:04.875 --> 09:07.250
We should get sandwiches,
I think.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.000
Come on, Nasty Kathy,
I'm sure we can find

09:09.000 --> 09:10.875
some live spiders
for you to eat.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.625
[dramatic music]

09:18.000 --> 09:19.542
It was an accident.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.875
So what, um, you-you
tripped and stumbled

09:21.875 --> 09:25.250
on to my ex-boyfriend's penis?

09:25.250 --> 09:27.250
No wonder you didn't tell
me who the father was.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.208
And everyone else knew, but me.
I mean, what's that about?

09:29.208 --> 09:31.000
I was planning on telling you.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.083
And Nasty Kathy
ruined everything.

09:33.083 --> 09:36.125
Yeah, well, you should've
told me first. Before anyone.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.583
I'm sorry.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.583
Of all the guys
in the world, why Noah?

09:42.583 --> 09:44.417
Don't say it like that.
"Why, Noah?"

09:44.417 --> 09:47.083
Just because he wasn't
good enough for you.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.375
I've liked him
since the sixth grade.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.708
But he was always into you.

09:50.708 --> 09:52.959
I was just the stupid
little sister.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.083
Until he bought you
at that date auction

09:54.083 --> 09:55.583
and you broke his heart.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.208
He came on to me
when I was seeing someone.

09:57.208 --> 10:00.250
Whatever. You gave up
any claim you had to him.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.625
And he was sad,
so...I made my move.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.417
- So you gave him rebound sex?
- God.

10:05.417 --> 10:06.917
You Lancer people
have a little

10:06.917 --> 10:08.417
judgmental term
for everything, don't you?

10:08.417 --> 10:10.291
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm just trying really hard

10:10.291 --> 10:12.875
to wrap my brain around this.

10:12.875 --> 10:15.250
He showed up at my window.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.792
We stayed up till 6:00 talking
about our lives, our futures.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.959
So this was that same night?

10:20.959 --> 10:23.959
For the first time,
he was paying attention to me.

10:23.959 --> 10:26.458
We fell in love.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.417
And we're getting married.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.834
- When?
- Soon.

10:30.834 --> 10:33.458
We're looking for apartments
as soon as midterms are over.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.625
The Cyclones said they'll
help me decorate the nursery.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.458
And Sandy's sister
has this adorable crib

10:37.458 --> 10:39.375
with adorable matching
furniture.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.500
Does mom know?

10:43.500 --> 10:47.458
She thinks it's the best thing
for the baby.

10:47.458 --> 10:49.125
And me.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.583
And you agree?

10:52.458 --> 10:55.208
- Charlotte, do you agree?
- Of course, I do.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.500
I love Noah.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.875
And he loves me.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.500
(Vanessa)
You won't believe
the day I had.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.834
The cherry was that
the phone call I got

11:10.834 --> 11:12.375
from the Mem-Chris cheer coach?

11:12.375 --> 11:14.250
Apparently, the girls,
they're using

11:14.250 --> 11:16.959
the same piece of music. And now
there's blood on the walls.

11:16.959 --> 11:19.458
[chuckles]
They got in a fight
over a song.

11:19.458 --> 11:20.667
- Really?
- Don't get me started.

11:20.667 --> 11:21.667
And Alice said she's gonna go

11:21.667 --> 11:23.166
talk to the band tonight

11:23.166 --> 11:25.875
to, I quote,
"Flash a little cleavage

11:25.875 --> 11:27.125
and straighten
the whole thing out."

11:27.125 --> 11:28.667
That always worked for me, so...

11:28.667 --> 11:30.125
Yeah, well,
I'll be sure and tell

11:30.125 --> 11:31.875
the new athletic director that.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.041
That's assuming
we even hire one.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.834
The search committee's
been looking.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.458
No one's taking the bait.

11:37.458 --> 11:38.708
Who'd want to be the poor SOB

11:38.708 --> 11:40.375
who has to clean up
Bill Marsh's mess?

11:40.375 --> 11:42.458
You two look like you
could use a refill.

11:42.458 --> 11:45.125
- Thanks, Wanda.
- On the house.

11:45.125 --> 11:47.708
I am so sorry to hear
about you and Derrick.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.041
Oh, how heartbreakin'.

11:52.041 --> 11:54.250
Yeah. It's, uh...

11:54.250 --> 11:56.583
Just thanks.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.708
Would've been
a lovely weddin'.

11:58.708 --> 12:01.708
They were talkin' to me
about doin' the event.

12:01.708 --> 12:04.375
Yeah, it's a shame that we won't
be working together.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.208
Unless, of course, um,
there's another weddin'

12:07.208 --> 12:09.500
comin' down the pike
sometime soon.

12:12.041 --> 12:15.041
No. That won't be
happening anytime soon.

12:15.041 --> 12:17.792
Who knows? I mean, ain't
none of gettin' any younger.

12:20.041 --> 12:22.208
Oh, coach, I put a little
water in that whiskey.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.917
You know, just in case
you're asked to suit up

12:23.917 --> 12:25.875
for the big game later on.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.667
Well, very thoughtful.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.625
We are never coming here again.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.125
Relax, it's just
Wanda being Wanda.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.583
- Don't.
- Okay.

12:42.583 --> 12:45.583
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna be that woman.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.750
Which woman is that exactly?

12:47.750 --> 12:51.125
The heartbreaker.
The bitch. The slut.

12:51.125 --> 12:54.083
Well, if they're so determined
to judge, I say "Let 'em."

12:54.083 --> 12:55.750
Oh, that's easy for you to say.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.917
- Why?
- 'Cause you're a guy.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.291
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah.

12:59.291 --> 13:01.583
Even in this
supposedly enlightened age

13:01.583 --> 13:04.375
there's a double standard.

13:04.375 --> 13:07.083
Don't you find something
new would come between us?

13:07.083 --> 13:09.041
What?

13:09.041 --> 13:10.333
My mom.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.083
She used to always say we, uh...

13:14.083 --> 13:15.792
we all carry around
our own hell with us

13:15.792 --> 13:17.583
like a turtle carries a shell.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.333
Now, I can't speak for you

13:19.333 --> 13:20.917
but, uh,
I've wasted a lot of years

13:20.917 --> 13:22.417
and I've delayed
a lot of happiness.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.417
And I'm not
gonna do it anymore.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.792
Red...

13:29.834 --> 13:31.291
Drop the shell.

13:33.250 --> 13:37.166
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.875
[instrumental music]

13:43.792 --> 13:45.208
[door opens]

13:47.458 --> 13:49.417
Hey.

13:49.417 --> 13:50.834
Where's Travis?

13:50.834 --> 13:52.625
Brought home
some dead food orders.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.125
I got a couple turkey burgers

13:54.125 --> 13:57.291
and a Greek salad
that looks pretty promisin'.

13:57.291 --> 14:00.500
Travis wanted to give
us some breathing room.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.500
So you and I can have
a little heart-to-heart.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.917
You sound serious.

14:06.708 --> 14:09.667
Why does Travis know things
about dad that I don't know?

14:09.667 --> 14:12.375
And more importantly, why don't
I know dad wrote music?

14:12.375 --> 14:14.625
Oh, I told you
he was a musician.

14:14.625 --> 14:18.625
Yeah, I know he played, I never
knew he actually wrote songs.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.208
You think
I wouldn't be interested?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.667
- Music is my thing.
- Music is one of your things.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.125
You're very versatile.

14:24.125 --> 14:27.542
Now can we please
change the subject?

14:27.542 --> 14:29.500
Talkin' about your father...

14:29.500 --> 14:31.375
...rest his soul,
is very painful.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.083
Unh-unh. No. No.

14:33.083 --> 14:36.708
If you can talk about dad to
Travis, you can talk to me too.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.583
Well, talkin' to Travis is not
like talkin' to a real person.

14:39.583 --> 14:40.917
What?

14:40.917 --> 14:43.959
Talkin' to Travis
is like talkin' to myself.

14:43.959 --> 14:46.083
It's like when people
come into the bar

14:46.083 --> 14:49.000
and blub on and on
about their stuff

14:49.000 --> 14:52.417
I do not judge,
because I do not care.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.375
It's cheaper
than therapy for them.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.875
You think I'm gonna judge you?

14:55.875 --> 14:57.208
Marti...

14:57.208 --> 15:00.041
...everything I have
done in my life

15:00.041 --> 15:02.041
has been for your benefit.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.667
So if I don't
wanna talk about a subject

15:04.667 --> 15:06.750
you can assume
there's a good reason.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.208
He's not a subject,
he's my father.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.667
Rex was a bad guy, okay?

15:12.667 --> 15:14.708
And the only decent thing
that he has ever

15:14.708 --> 15:16.041
done in his life is supply

15:16.041 --> 15:18.625
half of your DNA,
so that the less you know...

15:18.625 --> 15:20.083
- The less you'll get hurt.
- The less I'll get hurt.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.375
You realize you say
the same damn thing

15:22.375 --> 15:24.708
every single time
I ask about dad?

15:24.708 --> 15:26.417
I-I-I didn't realize
that I was being

15:26.417 --> 15:28.250
judged for originality.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.041
It was a difficult time
in my life.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.583
I carry a lot of hurt.

15:31.583 --> 15:35.250
Did you ever consider
where I fit into this story?

15:35.250 --> 15:37.959
No, I don't even know
what story we are talking about.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.542
I will not be yelled
at in my own home.

15:39.542 --> 15:43.083
I will not
be treated like a dishrag.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.542
Not the persecution face.
I'm not falling for it.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.208
- I'm going to a movie.
- Oh, yeah?

15:46.208 --> 15:49.708
Give you a chance to calm down
from your hysteria.

15:49.708 --> 15:52.417
Eat what you want.
The food is yours.

15:52.417 --> 15:53.875
[instrumental music]

15:59.667 --> 16:01.959
[chatter]

16:03.792 --> 16:06.750
I don't see the band here yet,
so I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.792
- Order me my usual?
- Sure.

16:08.792 --> 16:11.291
(man on microphone)
'Check one, check one, two,
three, four...'

16:11.291 --> 16:13.667
Excuse me? Hello.

16:15.166 --> 16:16.583
Excuse me.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.834
Barkeep, two whiskey
and sodas, please.

16:22.458 --> 16:26.291
- What you drinking?
- Orange juice.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.667
And an orange juice
for the lady, my fine sir.

16:31.917 --> 16:34.000
Thanks.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.291
Wait a second.
You look kinda familiar.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.917
- Do we know each other?
- Uh...

16:37.917 --> 16:40.458
Do you go to All Saints Church
on Vance Avenue?

16:40.458 --> 16:43.834
All Saints. Uh, no, uh...

16:43.834 --> 16:46.708
Not a lot of people
there that look like me.

16:46.708 --> 16:49.667
- Bald, right?
- That is exactly what I meant.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.041
Yes.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.917
Anyway, I'm bad with faces.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.208
Huh. So you like these guys?

16:58.208 --> 17:00.708
- Werewolf vs. Unicorn?
- Yeah. They're pretty cool.

17:00.708 --> 17:03.458
I saw them open
last year for Chromeo.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.500
At the New Daisy?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.000
Yeah. Were you there?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.750
Bought the bumper sticker.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.959
Wait, but are you sure these are
the guys that opened for 'em?

17:10.959 --> 17:13.000
Like I said,
"Bad with faces," but yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.708
'Cause I think
I'd recognize that name.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.000
The band's been through
a bunch of different names.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.375
Yet they still ended up
with the name

17:18.375 --> 17:21.125
Werewolf vs. Unicorn.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.834
Well, the name
they had before this

17:22.834 --> 17:26.083
was "Salute the Fat Man."

17:26.083 --> 17:28.750
And before that,
they were "Sticker Shock."

17:28.750 --> 17:30.375
And for an unfortunate
two weeks

17:30.375 --> 17:32.375
they were known as "Beefeater."

17:32.375 --> 17:34.625
Ugh. That...
Unh-unh.

17:36.875 --> 17:41.041
- So here's to Unicorn and--
- Werewolf.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.208
- Werewolf versus Unicorn.
- Versus Unicorn.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.750
Alright.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.708
Clink.

17:46.708 --> 17:49.000
Mm.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.834
Well, at least,
they're danceable.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.083
Yeah, and apparently
they're good

17:52.083 --> 17:54.667
for cheerleading routines too.

17:54.667 --> 17:55.875
You're into cheerleading?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.917
Oh, I am one.

17:57.917 --> 18:01.000
- I'm Lewis, by the way.
- Oh, no.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.500
What?

18:02.500 --> 18:04.208
You're a Hellcat and...

18:04.208 --> 18:06.417
...I'm officially an idiot.

18:06.417 --> 18:10.041
Nasty Kathy. I didn't realize
it was groupie night.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.750
I would've left my bra at home.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.708
- You two know each other?
- Mm-hmm.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.917
And you're here to lobby
the band, aren't you?

18:16.917 --> 18:19.250
- Behind our backs.
- Yup.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.291
But it's gonna be much more
fun with you here

18:21.291 --> 18:23.583
watching helplessly as I take
our song away from you.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.792
Okay, ladies.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.375
Oh, she's no lady.

18:30.291 --> 18:31.583
Fraternizing with the enemy?

18:31.583 --> 18:33.417
Hey, I don't believe in enemies.

18:33.417 --> 18:35.583
- I am a lover of humanity.
- Whatever.

18:35.583 --> 18:36.625
I never met a man I didn't like.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.166
No longer listening.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.250
Yeah, I don't know if you
remember me, but...

18:40.250 --> 18:42.417
Excuse me. Um, Simon.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.417
Hi. You remember me?

18:44.417 --> 18:46.500
Uh...

18:46.500 --> 18:48.458
You gave my cheer team
permission to use your song

18:48.458 --> 18:49.458
at our national competition.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.125
Oh.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.041
- Right.
- Yeah.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.875
And you gave me
permission to use it.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.166
Yeah, 'cause I didn't
know that Simon

18:56.166 --> 18:58.083
had already given
the song to somebody else.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.792
We're on opposing teams,
you can't give us both

18:59.792 --> 19:01.458
permission to use the song.

19:01.458 --> 19:02.583
- Can't you share?
- It doesn't work like that.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.333
We don't share.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.917
We're letting you use our song.
We're not charging you anything.

19:06.917 --> 19:08.458
I don't see where
the attitude is justified.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.792
This is a nationally
televised competition.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.458
It is fantastic
exposure for your band.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.000
- Don't pretend it isn't.
- Okay, fine.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.875
But we don't care
about your politics.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.125
So y'all figure it out
for yourselves. Flip a coin.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.333
- We could do that.
- No.

19:20.333 --> 19:23.333
Simon. You gave me permission.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.834
Permission which I consider
to be exclusive.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.417
I have it in writing.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.500
- On a bar napkin.
- I bought you eight beers.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.542
- I want my money's worth.
- Fine.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.041
Here's where we rehearse.
We'll be there around 11:30.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.166
When we're done our set tonight

19:38.166 --> 19:40.750
your squad and her squad,
you're gonna show up

19:40.750 --> 19:42.166
in your hot
little cheerleader outfits

19:42.166 --> 19:43.667
and you're gonna put
on a show for us.

19:43.667 --> 19:46.375
And underwear, optional.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.959
We're not putting
on a show for you guys.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.375
And I would never
be able to assemble

19:50.375 --> 19:52.500
my entire squad
on two hours' notice.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
- Then you don't get the song.
- Two hours?

19:54.500 --> 19:57.166
I-I can make that happen.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.792
Okay, fine. Yeah.
We'll be there too.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.333
Pleasure doing business.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.166
- Come on, Simon.
- Underwear is optional.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.834
Seriously.

20:05.834 --> 20:09.500
Hey, Alice, good luck
tracking down your squad.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.834
Mine are all in the same
youth group meeting.

20:13.417 --> 20:14.750
[snorts]

20:17.375 --> 20:20.083
- How'd it go?
- We have to call everyone.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.875
We need them in uniform
and ready to cheer.

20:23.166 --> 20:24.917
[instrumental music]

20:24.917 --> 20:26.250
[cell phone ringing]

20:36.500 --> 20:38.708
I was messed up after
that night in the movie theater.

20:38.708 --> 20:39.917
I needed someone to talk to

20:39.917 --> 20:41.834
and nobody knows you
like Charlotte.

20:44.250 --> 20:49.083
So you went to talk to my sister
about me and slept with her.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.125
When you lay it out like that,
it sounds sketchy.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.291
Gee, Noah, you think?

20:54.291 --> 20:56.208
I'm not proud of what I did.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.250
I strayed from my path,
but I deserve a little credit

20:58.250 --> 20:59.834
for trying to do
the right thing now.

21:01.417 --> 21:02.458
Do you love her?

21:03.583 --> 21:04.875
I offered to marry her.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.959
You didn't answer the question.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.750
- I love you.
- Oh, Noah, don't do this.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.875
No. Everything I said
in that movie theater was true.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.875
We can make it work between us.
I know we can.

21:18.875 --> 21:20.458
Stop.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.875
I'm sorry.

21:23.417 --> 21:26.208
I know my timing
is really bad.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.750
But I just feel...like this
could be my last chance

21:28.750 --> 21:31.458
to tell you how I feel.

21:31.458 --> 21:35.625
I've never stopped loving you,
and I never will.

21:35.625 --> 21:39.458
In three months, you will
have a wife and a baby.

21:39.458 --> 21:40.792
I will be your
sister-in-law.

21:40.792 --> 21:43.291
It doesn't have to be like that.

21:43.291 --> 21:45.750
Noah, nothing will ever happen

21:45.750 --> 21:48.500
with you and me. Okay?

21:48.500 --> 21:52.625
That night in the movie theater,
I obviously gave you false hope.

21:52.625 --> 21:55.208
I'm sorry for that.

21:55.208 --> 21:58.125
But the idea of us
running off together

21:58.125 --> 22:01.625
especially in light
of all this, well...

22:01.625 --> 22:03.583
That's just
an immature fantasy.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.792
You're acting like a child.

22:08.417 --> 22:10.083
I see.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.417
Well, then all you have
to do is say the word.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.458
The word, what word?

22:17.458 --> 22:19.917
Tell me you want me
to marry Charlotte and I will.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.667
Oh, my gosh.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.291
Wow.

22:28.291 --> 22:30.667
You got yourself
into this situation.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.875
You and Charlotte.

22:32.875 --> 22:36.333
So whatever you decide to do
about it is your responsibility.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.625
And trying to make
it my responsibility...

22:38.625 --> 22:41.458
...I'm sorry, Noah, but that's
a really crappy thing to do.

22:41.458 --> 22:42.917
Savannah?

22:45.792 --> 22:47.166
Goodbye, Noah.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.375
I can't believe
you finally got into Lancer.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.041
Hm. Thanks for the
vote of confidence.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.834
Well, you know what I mean.
It's exciting.

23:01.834 --> 23:03.500
You have any idea what
the film project's gonna be?

23:03.500 --> 23:06.000
The assignment
is to...make a trailer.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.542
I need a concept that's bold.

23:07.542 --> 23:09.834
You know, something
that shows I can move a camera.

23:09.834 --> 23:11.875
But I don't have
any money to work with.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.500
Sounds like suspense or horror.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.708
That's what I was thinking.

23:14.708 --> 23:16.000
Best ones are done
on the cheap.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.750
You wanna be in it?

23:17.750 --> 23:20.000
Only if you promise me
a blood-soaked, gory death.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.208
What are best friends for?

23:21.208 --> 23:23.667
I wanna see
my own intestines.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.792
- Lower, upper?
- Lower.

23:25.792 --> 23:27.708
I've been doing some sculpting
on my lower GI tract.

23:27.708 --> 23:31.041
- I wanna show it off.
- Vanity, thy name is woman.

23:31.041 --> 23:33.041
'Consider it done.'

23:33.041 --> 23:35.542
[cell phone ringing]

23:35.542 --> 23:37.208
Who is that,
your drug dealer?

23:37.208 --> 23:40.917
Mm. Alice.
Whatever she wants can wait.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.834
So dad's song...

23:48.875 --> 23:50.750
How was it?

23:53.875 --> 23:55.959
It was fine.

23:55.959 --> 23:57.917
The sheet music displayed
impeccable penmanship

23:57.917 --> 23:59.625
which apparently
I didn't inherit.

23:59.625 --> 24:01.959
Well, God rarely
gives with both hands.

24:06.458 --> 24:10.375
I've known you a long time.
You know that?

24:10.375 --> 24:12.208
Obviously.

24:12.208 --> 24:16.875
When you decide to accomplish
something, M, you go after it.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.333
Guns blazing.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.834
You do.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.917
If you wanted to know
about your dad, I mean...

24:25.917 --> 24:28.166
Wanda's never been
capable of stopping you.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.417
Your point?

24:29.417 --> 24:32.291
And if this means
so much to you...

24:32.291 --> 24:34.000
...why didn't you push harder?

24:39.834 --> 24:41.792
That's a good question.

24:43.959 --> 24:46.208
I was in eighth grade,
I think.

24:47.667 --> 24:50.375
And I, I asked
why they split up.

24:53.792 --> 24:56.917
She didn't want to talk
about it, but I kept pushing.

24:56.917 --> 24:59.834
No matter what she said,
I wouldn't let it go.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.500
She ends up in tears,
the bottle comes out

25:05.500 --> 25:09.041
she starts calling herself
a bad mom... Blah blah blah.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.667
Hitting herself in the face.

25:11.667 --> 25:14.667
Finally, I carried her
off to bed

25:14.667 --> 25:18.083
which is where she ended up
staying for the next week.

25:18.083 --> 25:22.333
I had to call her work and make
up some BS story about the flu.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.250
At the end of the day,
it just wasn't...

25:28.250 --> 25:30.000
...wasn't worth
the hassle, you know?

25:31.333 --> 25:33.125
Yeah, I guess not.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.667
She's known Travis
for two and a half minutes

25:39.667 --> 25:41.917
and she's spilling
her guts to him.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.708
That hurts.

25:46.708 --> 25:48.125
[instrumental music]

25:50.041 --> 25:51.417
[cell phone beeps]

25:53.667 --> 25:55.667
- It's not Alice, is it?
- No, it's Savannah.

25:55.667 --> 25:58.708
She's looking for you, actually.
Says it's an emergency.

26:00.708 --> 26:03.500
[chatter]

26:08.708 --> 26:09.875
Is Charlotte here yet?

26:09.875 --> 26:11.708
Not yet,
but thank God you guys are.

26:11.708 --> 26:13.208
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

26:13.208 --> 26:16.834
You ladies wearing underwear?

26:16.834 --> 26:18.625
You guys wearing a dunce cap?

26:18.625 --> 26:20.667
You should be.
You're underdressed without it.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.542
Touche.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.792
That dude's stoned.

26:27.792 --> 26:29.625
Why are we cheering
for these creeps again?

26:29.625 --> 26:32.583
We have to,
or we lose the song.

26:32.583 --> 26:35.917

attractive right about now.

Yeah. Sexy girls
with the bellies.

Maybe it's just me, but, uh...

collection of rude jackasses.

you guys can just take that

Derrick in the eyes

I hurt him.
I hurt him so much.

33:00.583 --> 33:03.291
And I just felt evil.

Telling the truth is not evil.
You are not evil.

who called security on us.

- No, no way.

34:16.041 --> 34:18.333
planning your wedding
with Derrick right now?

34:18.333 --> 34:23.083
Maybe. But it would've
been a mistake.

he was good to me

Don't beat yourself up.

- Mm-hmm.

by the way.

For having the courage to tell
Charlotte what I couldn't.

that marriage was doomed.

at me like that?

I'm too tired to be mad.

You know, when you were both
little girls I used to think

36:37.667 --> 36:39.959
it would get easier
as you got older.

36:39.959 --> 36:41.333
You'd be adults,
you wouldn't be dependent

36:41.333 --> 36:43.000
on me and your dad
for everything.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.125

get to relax.

they don't tell you?

any easier, being a mother.
