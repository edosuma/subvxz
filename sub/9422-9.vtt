00:01.000 --> 00:02.936
(Man) They’re often criticized

00:03.003 --> 00:04.938
for the reckless way
they live their lives,

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
ruling over Manhattan
from their ivory tower,

00:07.074 --> 00:09.042
untouchable, immortal.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.044
Its only when disaster strikes

00:11.111 --> 00:13.046
that the world is reminded...
(Gunshot)

00:13.113 --> 00:15.015
(Gunshot)
Even the Darlings are human.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.950
Tonight, nearly a month

00:17.017 --> 00:18.952
after Patrick Darling's
tragic senatorial inauguration,

00:19.019 --> 00:21.955
the family, in an effort
to set the record straight,

00:22.022 --> 00:23.957
has agreed to talk about
that day's events

00:24.024 --> 00:25.993
and the grievous aftermath.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.996
Do you know why chase Alexander
came looking for you that day?

00:29.062 --> 00:30.998
(Nick) He was angry,
I guess.

00:31.064 --> 00:34.968
I'd dealt with him briefly
in legal matters for the family.

00:35.035 --> 00:39.039
He was--is--
a very confused man.

00:39.106 --> 00:42.042
Upon reaching new Yorks
historic federal hall,

00:42.109 --> 00:44.011
chase Alexander,

00:44.077 --> 00:46.013
Patrick Darlings
brother-in-law,

00:46.079 --> 00:47.981
fired four bullets.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.017
In the confusion,
Jeremy Darling hit his head

00:50.083 --> 00:52.986
and was later diagnosed
with amnesia.
When the doctor told me

00:53.053 --> 00:55.956
that we'd have to work with him
to recover his memory,

00:56.023 --> 00:57.057
I was terrified.

00:57.124 --> 00:59.026
You know, Jeremy wasn't
the--the fastest learner

00:59.092 --> 01:02.029
the first time around.
(Man) The first bullet
grazed your shoulder.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.031
What was that like?

01:04.096 --> 01:06.934
It hurt...

01:07.000 --> 01:08.035
A lot.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.037
The next two bullets sailed
harmlessly away

01:10.103 --> 01:12.940
before Alexander was himself
gunned down

01:13.006 --> 01:15.976
by an actual NYPD officer,
Ty Lopez.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.011
If chase Alexander wasn't
in a coma right now

01:18.078 --> 01:19.947
at St. Benjamin's,

01:20.013 --> 01:22.015
and he were watching
this broadcast,

01:22.082 --> 01:25.018
what would you say to him?
I would say it has been
a long journey back

01:25.085 --> 01:27.020
from that difficult day,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.022
and on behalf of
all the Darlings,

01:29.089 --> 01:31.024
our thoughts are with him
and his family.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.993
A difficult day indeed,

01:33.060 --> 01:35.062
because Alexander's
fourth bullet found a target,

01:35.128 --> 01:37.030
albeit, an unintentional one,

01:37.097 --> 01:39.032
and took an innocent life.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.968
So who was she, senator?

01:41.034 --> 01:43.003
Who was Carmelita Rainer?

01:43.070 --> 01:45.005
She was a dear family friend.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.942
(Tripp)
She was a-a lovely person.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.945
Truly lovely.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.014
(Patrick)
It was me who invited her

01:54.081 --> 01:56.016
to attend the inauguration.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.019
I'm thinking of Jackie O.,
what she said...

01:59.086 --> 02:02.022
After J. F. K.'S assassination.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.957
"Now he is a legend

02:04.024 --> 02:06.026
when he would have preferred
to be a man."

02:06.093 --> 02:07.961
That's right.

02:08.027 --> 02:10.964
Now Carmelita is a legend

02:11.031 --> 02:16.036
when she would've preferred
to be a woman.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.038
We all miss her greatly.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.040
I swear,
they rerun that thing

02:20.107 --> 02:22.976
more than
"the Beverly hillbillies."

02:23.043 --> 02:26.947
I want to disappear.
Well, that's why I chose
this place,

02:27.014 --> 02:29.016
'cause it's always empty.
Yeah, I can taste why.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.984
Nick...

02:31.051 --> 02:32.953
Yeah.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.956
What happens
when chase wakes up?
He's been in a coma
for five weeks.

02:36.023 --> 02:39.026
I know, but if he does wake up,
he could go after you, right?

02:39.092 --> 02:41.929
Or me or Patrick or daddy
or any--
Karen, Karen,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.964
he's not coming after you
because he's not waking up.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.966
Okay?
Okay.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.001
I told you, it's over.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.003
(Sighs) Okay.
Well... (Chuckles)

02:50.070 --> 02:53.006
You know, there is, um,
there is something else

02:53.073 --> 02:56.009
you're not gonna want
to talk about.
Try me.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.046
Now that I'm single again,
and you're about to be,

02:59.112 --> 03:04.952
um, there's this
little issue of us.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.988
Karen, I am just coming out
of a 10-year marriage.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.990
I have a custody mediation
with Lisa today.

03:10.057 --> 03:13.994
And Kiki is convinced that she's
never gonna see me again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Throttle down.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.996
Nick, I was
just going to suggest...

03:16.063 --> 03:17.965
(Whispers)
That we be friends.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.967
Friends? We are friends.
(Normal voice)
No, just friends.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.034
Oh, just friends.
Yeah.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.937
When have we ever been
just friends?

03:24.004 --> 03:27.007
We were just friends for three
minutes once, the day we met,

03:27.074 --> 03:29.009
and then I fell in love
with you,

03:29.076 --> 03:31.011
but I for one, this time,

03:31.078 --> 03:34.948
would commit not to
fall in love with you.
Just friends?

03:35.015 --> 03:37.017
Just friends.
(Cell phone ringing)

03:37.084 --> 03:38.952
(Beep)

03:39.019 --> 03:40.954
Tripp, what can I do
for you?

03:41.021 --> 03:44.057
What about chase?
What's his status?

03:44.124 --> 03:46.026
Well, the doctors plan

03:46.093 --> 03:48.996
to take him off life support
on Friday

03:49.062 --> 03:50.964
in accordance with
his living will.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.032
Why?

03:52.099 --> 03:54.001
I got a call from
the chief administrator

03:54.067 --> 03:56.003
at St. Benjamin's

03:56.069 --> 03:59.973
saying that chase's wife Janine
was making some noise.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.043
About fighting his living will.
(Tripp) I mean,
she's obviously distraught.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.013
I suspect she's overwhelmed
with guilt.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.048
She left him at the height
of his mental breakdown,

04:08.115 --> 04:10.984
walked out.
She doesn't want
to let him go.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.987
No. Well, Carmelita's parents
did not want to let her go.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.055
Dad, please keep Carmelita
out of this.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.026
There's nothing we can do
to bring her back.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.962
No.

04:22.029 --> 04:26.934
Janine... doesn't have
a leg to stand on legally.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.970
So... she's just not
doing herself

04:30.037 --> 04:34.041
or the children a favor
by prolonging this misery.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.945
I'll stop by the hospital
later today

04:38.011 --> 04:41.014
after my mediation with Lisa.
That'll be good.
Thanks, Nick.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.051
Doggy.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.955
Yes. Which doggy?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.990
(Chuckling)
Midas.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.959
Hey!

04:52.025 --> 04:54.027
Guy. Nick, right? Nick.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.029
That's right.
Welcome home.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.965
Nick George.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.967
He helps me do stuff.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.036
Call him anytime,
day or night.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.972
Very good.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.975
You've definitely improved
since I saw you at the hospital.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.979
The neurologist said he has
a very unusual case,

05:12.045 --> 05:16.016
but... we're still hoping
for a full recovery.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.019
Well, I'm sure
it'll all work out.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.954
Hang in there, Jeremy.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.022
Bye, dick.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.056
Nick.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.992
Nick, right.
Nick.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.960
Nick. Nick.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.996
Nick. Nick.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.032
You've gotta be kidding.
You want 50% custody?

05:32.099 --> 05:35.035
In our case, I think that
a 50-50 custody arrangement

05:35.102 --> 05:38.038
is appropriate.
You work for a guy

05:38.105 --> 05:41.041
who you used to be pretty
convinced killed your father.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.945
Your definition of what's
appropriate doesn't count much.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.947
Look, no one said
divorce was easy.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.951
Let's just try and stay focused
on the custody of your daughter.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.953
Lisa, I know you think
I'm a good father.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.023
It wasn't that long ago you
suggested we have another baby.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.959
That was before
I really knew you.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.994
After over ten years
of marriage,

06:01.061 --> 06:03.931
you didn't really know me?
The important question

06:03.997 --> 06:07.000
is what's going to be best
for Kiki.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.002
All right.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.039
You want Kiki 50% of the time,
prove you can handle it.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.942
Happy to.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.944
I'm going to Miami tomorrow
to meet with Christo,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.947
and Kiki was going to stay
with my mom,

06:20.013 --> 06:22.015
but you can take her
for the weekend.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.051
If things go smoothly,
we'll talk.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.986
Fair enough?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.021
Fair enough.

06:32.125 --> 06:38.031
It's so nice to be back
in a regular bed

06:38.098 --> 06:41.935

10:21.989 --> 10:23.991
200 parishioners
for "meet the pastor" night?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.993
Don't these people have
friggin' televisions?

10:26.059 --> 10:30.063
(Laughs) Well, it's not often
a minister of your renown

10:30.130 --> 10:32.032
returns to the pulpit, Brian.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.001
Everyone wants to meet you.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.003
No, they don't want
to meet me.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.006
They want a chance to gawk
at my relatives.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.041
So they are coming,
your family?

10:41.108 --> 10:44.978
Why? You want to alert
"page six"?

10:45.045 --> 10:48.048
(Chuckles) No.
I'd like to thank them.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.987
We needed $1.6 million

10:54.054 --> 10:56.056
to finish paying
for our pipe organ.

10:56.123 --> 11:01.094
Yesterday, that exact amount
was donated in your honor.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.998
By whom?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.967
Well,
the donor was anonymous,

11:07.034 --> 11:11.038
but I'm sure we can both guess
who it is.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.941
Yeah.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.943
I'm sure we both can.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.044
(Kiki) Tell me why.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.013
Why can't you and mom
be together?

11:20.080 --> 11:23.016
I asked mommy,
and she said she loves you,

11:23.083 --> 11:25.018
that she'll always love you.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.054
Right, I will always
love your mom.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.022
But it's just,
sometimes for some reason,

11:29.089 --> 11:32.025
we do things to hurt each other,
and it's not good for us.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.929
But most importantly, we know
it's not good for you.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.998
But I'll only see you
every couple of days,

11:38.065 --> 11:40.000
and that's not good for me.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.002
I know.
I know it's hard.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.037
And I'll only stay with you,
like, every other weekend.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.940
Yeah, but that's--
that's just for now.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.943
That will change.
What if you fall in love
with someone else

11:50.010 --> 11:52.045
and move to, like,
Germany or something?

11:52.112 --> 11:56.016
Dad, I'd never see you again.
Kiki, I'm not moving
to Germany.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.018
All right?
Now just listen to me.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.020
Your mom and I, we are...

12:00.087 --> 12:02.923
We're going through
some challenging times.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.958
But I love you
more than anything.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.028
I will always be your dad,
and that's a promise.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.998
All right? And I'm here,
and I'm not going anywhere.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.001
I'm not going to Germany.
I'm not going to France.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.037
Not going to New Jersey.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.973
All right?

12:20.040 --> 12:23.043
All right. Come on.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.016
(Simon) Are you sure
Nick can handle it?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.919
Yes, he'll make sure
the living will is respected.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.021
You don't have to worry.
Oh, I'm not worried.
You should be.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.957
If this guy chase
comes out of this coma,

12:37.024 --> 12:38.992
then some very nasty truths

12:39.059 --> 12:40.994
also come out
about your boss Patrick.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.963
I'm well aware.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.032
Our favorite U. S. Senator
would suddenly become

12:45.098 --> 12:48.001
a worthless asset.
Trust me. He'll make sure
the plug is pulled.

12:48.068 --> 12:52.940
See that he does,
or you're worthless to me, too.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.008
Your honor,
there is wishful thinking

12:55.075 --> 12:57.044
and then there are facts.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.979
No qualified physician
has been willing

12:59.046 --> 13:02.015
to testify in support
of Mrs. Alexander's case.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.952
She simply cannot be allowed
to override

13:05.018 --> 13:07.020
the clearly documented wish
of her husband,

13:07.087 --> 13:09.957
which was for a peaceful death.
Your honor.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.059
Yes, Mr. Brackman.
Before Mr. Alexander

13:12.125 --> 13:15.028
is yanked offstage
into eternity by the Darlings,

13:15.095 --> 13:19.066
his eldest daughter Jillian
would like to take the stand.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.938
All right.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.074
Proceed.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.924
Jillian, would you please
tell the court

13:43.991 --> 13:46.960
what your daddy said to you
before he left for New York

13:47.027 --> 13:49.062
the first time,
after your aunt Ellen died?

13:49.129 --> 13:52.966
Your honor, relevance?
I'd like to see
where this is going.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.035
You may answer
the question.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.037
(Sighs)

13:57.104 --> 14:00.040
He said he was sorry
he had to go,

14:00.107 --> 14:02.976
but that he had to,

14:03.043 --> 14:05.979
to do the right thing
for aunt Ellen.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.981
Uh, objection, your honor.
This is hearsay.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.984
Overruled.
Finish your thought, miss.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.053
What else did he say,
Jillian?

14:13.120 --> 14:16.957
He said that
he loved me very much,

14:17.024 --> 14:21.061
and that whatever happened,
that would never, ever change.

14:21.128 --> 14:25.065
Is there anything else
that you want to say?

14:29.036 --> 14:32.973
I know my daddy hurt
a lot of people...

14:33.040 --> 14:35.008
But I don't want him
to go away.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.979
(Voice breaks)
Please don't make him go away.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.014
(Cries)

14:41.081 --> 14:45.018
Uh, your honor,
a short recess?

14:48.989 --> 14:52.059
A recess?
This isn't grade school?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.061
Well, I'd suggest
that you handle the cross,

14:54.127 --> 14:57.965
but that's right,
you've been suspended.
It doesn't take
an active legal license

14:58.031 --> 14:59.967
to know you're
about to lose in there.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.035
A living will is nothing
compared to the tears

15:02.102 --> 15:05.005
of a wittle girl
who wuvs her daddy.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.007
You're this committed
to Patrick's career?

15:07.074 --> 15:09.009
Is that what this is?
I'm just doing my job.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.011
Maybe you should try it
sometime.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.980
(Tripp) Ms. lyons.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.016
Would you excuse us,
please?

15:19.119 --> 15:21.955
What, Tripp?
I'm not going to attack

15:22.022 --> 15:24.024
the testimony
of a 9-year-old girl.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.026
I would not want you to.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.996
We've already risked
tarnishing our public profile

15:29.062 --> 15:31.999
by pursuing this,
but the law is the law.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.002
Well, then you're gonna
have to go in there and say so,

15:35.068 --> 15:37.938
because I'm--
Nick, what's the matter?

15:38.005 --> 15:39.940
You can't just push
and push and push

15:40.007 --> 15:41.975
for whatever you want
in this world

15:42.042 --> 15:45.045
without taking other people into
account, especially children.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.047
This man killed Carmelita.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.983
You and Karen were both
seriously injured.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.986
Well, I can't take away
a little girl's last chance

15:53.053 --> 15:55.989
at seeing her father again...

15:56.056 --> 15:58.926
Whatever he did.

15:58.992 --> 16:02.029
You can't just eliminate people
whenever you feel like it.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.968
What in heaven's name
are you talking about?

16:08.035 --> 16:10.070
Nothing.
Nick...

16:10.137 --> 16:12.039
Look...

16:12.105 --> 16:14.975
They put Letitia on trial,

16:15.042 --> 16:17.044
but we both know
who really did it.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.980
Really?

16:20.047 --> 16:22.049
And my dad
was a first-class bastard,

16:22.115 --> 16:26.954
but that didn't mean
he deserved to die either.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.022
Now I'm gonna
go back in there,

16:29.089 --> 16:31.992
and I'm gonna tell 'em
we rest our case,

16:32.059 --> 16:34.061
and the judge can rule
as he sees fit,

16:34.127 --> 16:37.931
but I'm not gonna take
that little girl's father away.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.933
I'm sorry. I can't.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.442
Nick! Hey, Nick!

16:57.508 --> 16:59.410
Hey, Karen.
How you doing?
Hey.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.512
Listen, I'm in a--
I'm in a rush. I gotta go.

17:01.579 --> 17:04.449
Oh, where you going?
Uh, I gotta go
to Kiki's school.

17:04.515 --> 17:06.451
(Gasps)
I gotta--if I'm not there
in ten minutes,

17:06.517 --> 17:10.387
I'm gonna be late.
It wouldn't look good.
Oh, you're playing daddy.

17:10.454 --> 17:12.457
No, actually, I am a daddy,
Karen, and I've got Kiki

17:12.522 --> 17:15.492
for the weekend--a very,
very important weekend.
Okay, well, how can I help?

17:15.560 --> 17:18.496
How can you help?
I-I-I don't know?
Well, I don't know either,
but you seem a little busy

17:18.563 --> 17:20.464
with your job
and now your daddy duties,

17:20.531 --> 17:23.468
and I can't do the lawyer thing,
but maybe I could look after...
Kiki.

17:23.534 --> 17:26.471
Kiki for you if you want.
Um, well, actually,
the point is for me

17:26.537 --> 17:28.473
to spend time
with my daughter, Karen,

17:28.539 --> 17:30.475
not toss her into your
capable, manicured hands.

17:30.541 --> 17:33.444
Uh, you don't think
I can handle this.
No, no, no, no, Karen,
the issue is not

17:33.511 --> 17:35.513
whether or not
you can handle it.

17:35.580 --> 17:38.416
The--the mediator
seems more interested

17:38.483 --> 17:40.485
in whether or not I can.
Okay, just for the record,
I know I'm not mama Lisa...

17:40.551 --> 17:42.453
Yeah. Uh-huh.
But I can babysit.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.455
Yeah, and I know that, Karen,
and the next time

17:44.522 --> 17:46.491
that I need Kiki to spend
the day getting massages

17:46.557 --> 17:49.494
and going shoe shopping,
I will call you, okay?
Oh, okay, yeah.
You know what, Nick?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.497
You really kind of suck at this
whole "just friends" thing.
Karen!

17:52.563 --> 17:54.465
You really do.
Thank you.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.468
(Sighs)

17:57.535 --> 17:59.504
Taxi!

18:04.509 --> 18:08.413
(Blows air)

18:08.479 --> 18:10.415
I thought you were
coming to bed.

18:10.481 --> 18:12.417
Oh, no. It's not
looking too good.

18:12.483 --> 18:13.484
I'm sorry.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.421
I'm just trying
to come up with a-a prayer

18:16.487 --> 18:17.488
for this thing tomorrow.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.424
What thing?

18:19.490 --> 18:22.427
It's for this
"meet the pastor" thing.

18:22.493 --> 18:25.496
Oh.

18:28.466 --> 18:30.435
Were you gonna invite me?

18:30.501 --> 18:32.437
Yeah. Sure, you're invited.

18:32.503 --> 18:36.474
I... I just hadn't gotten around
to telling you about it yet.

18:36.541 --> 18:38.476
It's tomorrow.

18:38.543 --> 18:43.481
Honestly, I-I-I figured
you wouldn't want to come.

18:43.548 --> 18:46.417
I mean, it's just gonna be

18:46.484 --> 18:49.420
a lot of bad coffee
and Jesus.

18:49.487 --> 18:53.491
Brian, I'm your wife

18:53.558 --> 18:55.493
and you're a minister.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.430
I know the drill.

18:59.497 --> 19:00.498
Then come. Fine.

19:00.565 --> 19:03.468
I mean, what do I care?

19:03.534 --> 19:06.437
I gotta go make some coffee.

19:06.504 --> 19:08.539
I think it's gonna be
an all-nighter.

19:13.511 --> 19:15.480
What the hell happened?
No idea.

19:15.546 --> 19:17.482
Nick short-circuited
like a space heater

19:17.548 --> 19:19.417
in a railroad flat.

19:19.484 --> 19:21.486
Tripp's looking
for a new lawyer.

19:21.552 --> 19:24.455
Until then...
The living will is suspended.

19:24.522 --> 19:26.457
And that guy lies there
like a time bomb

19:26.524 --> 19:29.494
waiting to wake up and destroy
everything I've worked for.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.397
I could appeal my suspension
and reopen the case

19:32.463 --> 19:35.400
if that's something
that you want--
no, no. Stop, stop. No, no.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.502
The time for legal remedies
is over.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.473
You're gonna take care
of this, with finality.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.475
What does that mean?

19:44.542 --> 19:47.445
It means
chase cant wake up.

19:47.512 --> 19:49.380
It means that Patrick

19:49.447 --> 19:51.382
can't go to Washington
with this looming.

19:51.449 --> 19:53.484
He's too important
to my plans.

19:53.551 --> 19:55.486
(Sighs) All right.

19:55.553 --> 19:59.457
I will make sure that you
have access to chase's room.

19:59.524 --> 20:02.460
The guard will
conveniently step away,

20:02.527 --> 20:06.431
and you, my little angel,
will pull the plug.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.433
No, I will not.
Yes, you will.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.435
I cannot.
You can and you will do it!

20:10.501 --> 20:13.438
I am not gonna have blood
on my hands because of you!

20:13.504 --> 20:17.475
Or I promise you, you'll never
see your brother again.

20:29.089 --> 20:30.957
(Footsteps approach)

20:31.024 --> 20:32.959
Mr. Jeremy.

20:33.026 --> 20:36.029
A lady to see you.

20:36.096 --> 20:38.965
Well, hello.

20:39.032 --> 20:40.967
Hope I knew you.

20:41.034 --> 20:43.036
You did.

20:43.103 --> 20:44.971
Who are you?

20:45.038 --> 20:47.974
Nola... lyons.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.010
I work with
your brother Patrick,

20:50.076 --> 20:52.012
as his chief of staff.

20:52.078 --> 20:55.015
And once, a while ago,

20:55.081 --> 20:58.985
you and I were...

20:59.052 --> 21:01.293
I had sex with you?

21:01.360 --> 21:03.362
(Laughs) Y-yes.
We had sex.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.265
(Chuckles) More than once.
Maximum.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.300
Okay, get over yourself now.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.369
So what can I do you for?

21:10.435 --> 21:12.371
You come back
for a rebate?

21:12.437 --> 21:15.340
No, I guess I just wanted
to see you,

21:15.407 --> 21:18.343
just in case
something bad happened,

21:18.410 --> 21:20.345
to say good-bye.

21:20.412 --> 21:23.282
What's the matter?

21:23.348 --> 21:26.318
Jeremy, I know
you don't remember...

21:26.385 --> 21:30.289
But I'm in a really bad
situation.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.323
Chase Alexander is--

21:31.390 --> 21:33.392
the dude that shot the lady?

21:33.458 --> 21:36.261
Carmelita? Yes.

21:36.328 --> 21:39.264
He's lying in a hospital
on life support,

21:39.331 --> 21:41.333
and I... I have to, um...

21:41.400 --> 21:43.435
You have to what?

21:50.409 --> 21:52.311
Nola, I--

21:52.377 --> 21:54.313
nola.
(Blocks clatter)

21:54.379 --> 21:56.281
What's wrong?

21:56.348 --> 21:57.349
Am I interrupting?

21:57.416 --> 22:00.319
No, no. I was just, uh,

22:00.385 --> 22:02.254
just leaving.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.356
Dear, before you go,
would you mind?
Uh...

22:04.423 --> 22:06.258
For Jeremy's flash cards.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.327
Letitia, trust me, this is not
the kind of moment

22:08.393 --> 22:10.329
that memories are made of.
(Camera shutter clicks)

22:10.395 --> 22:12.297
Oh, God.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.399
(Letitia)
Oh, lovely, lovely.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.375
Honey? Let's go.
We're gonna be late.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.280
That's what you're gonna wear to
the "meet the pastor" night?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.381
Yeah.

22:29.448 --> 22:33.285
You look like a piñata.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.287
(Sighs)

22:35.354 --> 22:37.322
You know what?

22:37.389 --> 22:39.358
I can't do this.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.293
Do what?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.328
Fight with you
about your snotty,

22:43.395 --> 22:46.298
childish crap.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.367
If you don't want me
to come along, Brian,

22:48.433 --> 22:51.303
just say it.
Come. Don't come.
I don't care.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.339
Just say it.
What?!

22:54.406 --> 22:57.442
That you don't want
to be married to me.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.313
Brian...

23:01.380 --> 23:05.384
What you did by marrying me
was a beautiful gesture.

23:05.450 --> 23:09.354
I was dying, and it might
have saved my life.

23:09.421 --> 23:12.357
But the way
that we're living?

23:12.424 --> 23:15.327
Not so beautiful.

23:15.394 --> 23:19.264
Let's not torture
each other.

23:19.331 --> 23:23.302
We both love Brian Jr.,
and I love you...

23:23.368 --> 23:28.407
But it's all right to say
you want out.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.314
No.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.349
No, it isn't.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.451
Yes, it is.

23:44.389 --> 23:46.425
Okay, fine. I want out.

23:57.336 --> 23:59.338
Thank you.

24:01.340 --> 24:04.343
(Bishop Bascombe)
God bless Brian Darling.

24:04.409 --> 24:06.378
Saint Melar's is so fortunate

24:06.445 --> 24:09.381
to have him back
in its cradle.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.318
Brian is a man of enormous faith

24:13.385 --> 24:15.320
whose many gifts,

24:15.387 --> 24:19.291
especially the generosity
he inspires,

24:19.358 --> 24:22.361
are going to be
of great benefit to us all.

24:22.427 --> 24:24.363
And so...

24:24.429 --> 24:27.366
Let us thank him
for his return to the church

24:27.432 --> 24:31.303
as our counselor, our guide...

24:31.370 --> 24:33.338
(Whispers) Our bank.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.274
Our reverend.

24:35.340 --> 24:36.375
To Brian Darling--

24:36.441 --> 24:39.344
welcome.

24:58.430 --> 25:02.334
What are you doing here?

25:02.401 --> 25:05.270
Paying my respects.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.273
You're not the only one
who misses her, you know?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.310
I do, too.

25:11.376 --> 25:14.313
That memorial service
haunts me...

25:14.379 --> 25:17.282
The senseless loss.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.318
I was just
trying to understand,

25:19.384 --> 25:21.386
I guess...

25:21.453 --> 25:24.423
What she meant to you.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.393
She was the love
of my life.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.362
Yet you refused
to lift a finger

25:30.429 --> 25:33.298
to see justice done
to her murderer.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.334
You're either a Saint

25:35.400 --> 25:38.270
or there is something
so stoppered up inside you

25:38.337 --> 25:40.272
that it prevented you
from responding

25:40.339 --> 25:42.274
with the full force
of your heart.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.375
What are you getting at?

25:43.442 --> 25:46.311
You didn't express
your righteous anger.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.314
And it worries me
that you missed a chance to...

25:49.381 --> 25:51.383
Grow as a person.

25:53.385 --> 25:56.388
Anger doesn't make you
a person, dad.

25:56.455 --> 25:59.358
There is a place
in this world...

25:59.424 --> 26:03.295
There is a place
in the human heart...

26:03.362 --> 26:06.298
For vengeance.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.368
Things needed
to be set right.

26:09.434 --> 26:14.339
If not for you,
then for her.

26:25.350 --> 26:29.288
(Nick) This is
the $1.6-million organ, huh?

26:29.354 --> 26:30.355
Yep.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.357
Ah, it doesn't look like
it's worth

26:32.424 --> 26:35.327
more than $1.1 tops.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.296
Well, I hope Tripp's proud.

26:37.362 --> 26:39.298
Brian, I told you,
if Tripp had given

26:39.364 --> 26:41.333
this amount of money to
the church, even anonymously,

26:41.400 --> 26:43.368
I would know about it.
He didn't.

26:43.435 --> 26:47.339
Yeah? Well, then explain
this counselor.
"Mark chapter 1, verse 11."
What's that?

26:47.406 --> 26:49.341
"And there came a voice
from heaven

26:49.408 --> 26:51.343
"saying 'thou are
my beloved son

26:51.410 --> 26:54.379
in whom
I am well pleased.'"

26:54.446 --> 26:56.381
my beloved son?

26:56.448 --> 27:00.385
Yeah. So if Tripp didn't do it,
who did?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.296
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

27:11.363 --> 27:14.366
He's dead, Brian.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.335
Our father's dead.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.337
Hey, Nick, this whole
friggin' building

27:18.403 --> 27:20.339
is dedicated to the idea

27:20.405 --> 27:22.307
that everyone thought
some guy was dead

27:22.374 --> 27:24.376
and then he wasn't.

27:26.345 --> 27:30.249
I'm just saying,
it wouldn't be the first time.

27:40.085 --> 27:42.021
Our father
can't be alive, Brian.

27:42.087 --> 27:44.023
You know, how can you
be so sure?

27:44.089 --> 27:46.091
They never recovered his body.
Well, they found his plane.

27:46.158 --> 27:48.093
Yeah,
without him in it.
(Jeremy) Hey!

27:48.160 --> 27:51.096
Lawyer guy.
Nick. It's Nick, Jeremy.

27:51.163 --> 27:54.033
Right. Nick.
I was looking for you.

27:54.099 --> 27:55.100
Uh... what's her name?

27:55.167 --> 27:58.103
The--that Chinese lady
with the freckles?
Nola lyons.

27:58.170 --> 28:00.105
Right. Nola.
She has a problem.

28:00.172 --> 28:02.141
Um... she seemed
radically torqued

28:02.207 --> 28:06.078
about this guy...
In--in--in the hospital.

28:06.145 --> 28:08.047
Chase Alexander.
Chase. Right.

28:08.113 --> 28:10.115
Well, what did she say
about him?

28:10.182 --> 28:12.051
She told me good-bye,

28:12.117 --> 28:16.021
like--like she wasn't
gonna be coming back,

28:16.088 --> 28:18.090
like she was gonna
do something, tonight maybe.

28:18.157 --> 28:20.125
I--the hard drive's
all corrupted.

28:20.192 --> 28:22.127
Thank you, Jeremy.
I'll see you.

28:22.194 --> 28:26.098
Hey. Brian, right?

28:35.174 --> 28:37.109
Old church people
not your thing?

28:37.176 --> 28:40.112
Not really.
They smell funny.

28:40.179 --> 28:44.116
Don't they?
What is that?

28:45.217 --> 28:48.120
You know, I used to
come out here and play

28:48.187 --> 28:52.057
when I was your age,
eight or so years ago.

28:52.124 --> 28:54.093
That would make you 20.

28:54.159 --> 28:56.128
Someone needs a math tutor.

28:56.195 --> 28:59.064
Where's your dad?

28:59.131 --> 29:03.068
He had some work emergency,
so he left me with Letitia.

29:03.135 --> 29:05.137
This was supposed to be
our weekend,

29:05.204 --> 29:07.106
and he left.

29:07.172 --> 29:09.074
Look...

29:09.141 --> 29:12.077
You're probably
not thrilled with him right now,

29:12.144 --> 29:15.147
but your dad's
a really good guy.

29:15.214 --> 29:18.150
Your mom
on the other hand...

29:18.217 --> 29:20.019
Yeah?

29:20.085 --> 29:22.121
Loves you very much.

29:22.187 --> 29:25.157
She hates your guts.

29:25.224 --> 29:27.159
(Mouths word)

29:30.095 --> 29:33.132
(Bell tolling)
Do you think my mom and dad
will ever get back together?

29:33.198 --> 29:36.201
I don't know.

29:38.137 --> 29:40.039
My parents stayed together,

29:40.105 --> 29:43.108
and, baby,
it was nothing but trouble.

29:43.175 --> 29:45.044
Life is weird.

29:45.110 --> 29:48.013
I know. (Sighs)

29:48.080 --> 29:50.082
I guess...

29:50.149 --> 29:53.052
You know, every Saturday night
at our house

29:53.118 --> 29:55.054
used to be movie night.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.155
Dad would cook,

29:56.221 --> 30:01.093
and then he, mom and I
would watch a movie.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.095
I miss movie night.

30:04.196 --> 30:06.131
Well...

30:06.198 --> 30:08.133
Even if your mom and dad
are living apart,

30:08.200 --> 30:11.136
you can still have
movie night.

30:11.203 --> 30:14.073
But not
with both of them.

30:14.139 --> 30:16.075
No. No, you're right.

30:16.141 --> 30:18.077
But... you could have
one with your mom

30:18.143 --> 30:20.212
and one with your dad.

30:22.214 --> 30:26.018
Sometimes...
Things can change

30:26.085 --> 30:31.123
and not be...
You know, awful.

30:36.161 --> 30:38.097
You're nicer
than mom says.

30:38.163 --> 30:40.132
Not really.

30:45.204 --> 30:49.141
(Siren wailing in distance)

30:55.180 --> 30:58.183
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:18.137 --> 31:21.073
Nola.

31:21.140 --> 31:24.143
What are you doing here?

31:24.209 --> 31:28.047
You don't understand.

31:28.113 --> 31:30.082
Did Tripp
put you up to this?
No.

31:30.149 --> 31:33.085
Patrick?
No. Just get out
and let me do this.

31:33.152 --> 31:37.089
You know
that's not gonna happen.
If I don't, you don't know--
you don't know anything.

31:37.156 --> 31:40.059
All right. Enlighten me.
What's going on?

31:40.125 --> 31:43.128
If I could tell you,
I would.

31:43.195 --> 31:47.032
All right.

31:47.099 --> 31:48.100
I believe you, okay?

31:48.167 --> 31:51.036
But whatever you're doing
for whatever reason,

31:51.103 --> 31:53.105
it can't happen.
I won't let it.

31:53.172 --> 31:56.041
Nick--
now the police
are already on their way,

31:56.108 --> 31:58.043
wherever the hell
they got to.

31:58.110 --> 32:00.079
I'm not gonna have you arrested,
but I am gonna have

32:00.145 --> 32:02.081
somebody posted here 24/7
with the specific orders

32:02.147 --> 32:05.117
not to allow you
anywhere near him.

32:05.184 --> 32:08.020
Come on. Let's go.

32:35.326 --> 32:38.262
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:38.329 --> 32:40.197
You took a life--

32:40.264 --> 32:43.234
the only person
I ever really loved.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.237
And I want you
to hear her name.

32:48.305 --> 32:50.241
Carmelita.

32:50.307 --> 32:52.243
She was everything to me.

32:52.309 --> 32:57.248
I wasn't even alive
until I met her.

33:00.217 --> 33:03.220
And, uh...

33:03.287 --> 33:08.259
Now... I'm like you...

33:10.261 --> 33:12.229
Alive...

33:12.296 --> 33:16.233
But dead.

33:16.300 --> 33:20.171
I've got no reason
to keep breathing.

33:20.237 --> 33:23.140
Do you get it now, chase,

33:23.207 --> 33:26.143
why I have to kill you?

33:26.210 --> 33:29.213
(Beeping continues)

33:30.281 --> 33:34.251
Except I know what...
She would say.

33:38.255 --> 33:41.192
"Paddy...

33:41.258 --> 33:44.195
"There's...

33:44.261 --> 33:47.264
There's already been
too much dyin'."

33:47.331 --> 33:52.269
So, uh...
You go on livin', chase.

33:52.336 --> 33:55.172
That's punishment enough.

33:55.239 --> 33:58.209
(Beeping continues)

34:06.317 --> 34:09.219
What's going on?

34:10.286 --> 34:12.255
Andrea, what are you doing?

34:12.322 --> 34:15.192
I'm gonna stay with
a friend for a few days

34:15.259 --> 34:17.194
until I figure things out.
You're leaving me
just 'cause I--

34:17.261 --> 34:19.163
because you've made it clear

34:19.230 --> 34:22.333
that you don't want me
to stay here? Yes.

34:25.302 --> 34:27.237
But I do.

34:27.304 --> 34:29.239
This is why we aren't
having this conversation.

34:29.306 --> 34:32.208
You'll say anything
to get what you want

34:32.275 --> 34:36.179
because you are afraid
of being left alone,

34:36.246 --> 34:39.183
which is how we got
into this mess.

34:39.250 --> 34:42.152
You have your family,

34:42.219 --> 34:44.188
and now the church.

34:44.255 --> 34:46.223
Hey, you know what?
Screw the church.

34:46.290 --> 34:50.161
You know why they had
this little shindig for me?

34:50.226 --> 34:52.228
So they could dig
deeper into my pockets

34:52.295 --> 34:55.166
for the next contribution.

34:55.232 --> 34:57.201
'Cause guess what.

34:57.268 --> 34:59.303
I'm a billionaire.

35:03.274 --> 35:06.243
But you never cared
about that.

35:06.310 --> 35:09.146
When Brian Jr. was born,

35:09.213 --> 35:11.248
you refused child support.

35:11.315 --> 35:15.219
When I sent you checks
to Brazil, you ripped 'em up.

35:15.286 --> 35:18.189
Are you blaming me
for that?

35:18.255 --> 35:21.258
No,
I'm just saying that...

35:21.325 --> 35:25.262
Everybody else in the world
just wants me for my money.

35:27.231 --> 35:30.234
You're the only one
who wants me for who I am.

35:30.301 --> 35:34.238
And I'm sorry that
that just makes me...

35:34.305 --> 35:38.209
A little bit uncomfortable
sometimes.

35:38.275 --> 35:41.245
Look, I can't lie.

35:41.312 --> 35:45.316
I jumped into this marriage
for some wrong reasons.

35:47.284 --> 35:50.187
But I'm staying in it...

35:50.254 --> 35:52.289
For some good ones.

35:54.258 --> 35:56.293
I mean,
if you'll have me.

36:04.301 --> 36:06.237
(Knock on door)

36:06.303 --> 36:09.140
Hi.

36:09.206 --> 36:10.241
Hey. What happened?

36:10.307 --> 36:12.243
When you called,
you said one hour.

36:12.309 --> 36:15.212
We stopped to feed the poor.

36:15.279 --> 36:18.215
We went to cafe lalo
for ice cream.
Cool.

36:19.283 --> 36:21.152
(Nick) Ah.

36:21.218 --> 36:23.220
Thanks for hanging out
tonight, aunt Karen.

36:23.287 --> 36:25.222
I had fun.
You're welcome.

36:25.289 --> 36:27.191
(Whispers) I love you, dad.

36:27.258 --> 36:29.126
I love you, too.

36:29.193 --> 36:30.227
(Footsteps move away)

36:30.294 --> 36:32.229
Aunt Karen.

36:32.296 --> 36:34.198
Look at you.

36:34.265 --> 36:36.167
Yeah, look at me.

36:36.233 --> 36:38.135
Karen, I'm sorry.

36:38.202 --> 36:40.171
That's nowhere near enough.

36:40.237 --> 36:43.174
I am sorry I didn't trust you
to help out with Kiki

36:43.240 --> 36:45.176
from the moment you offered.

36:45.242 --> 36:47.211
I should have.
And I accept your apology.

36:47.278 --> 36:51.148
You know why? Because that's
what friends do. Don't they?

36:51.215 --> 36:54.151
They do.
(Kiki) Dad,
I want to watch a movie.

36:54.218 --> 36:56.253
I will be right there.

36:58.322 --> 37:00.257
Well...

37:00.324 --> 37:03.227
Well... good night.

37:03.294 --> 37:06.130
Good night... friend.

37:06.197 --> 37:07.231
Yes.

37:07.298 --> 37:10.267
That's... what we are now.

37:10.334 --> 37:13.137
(Sighs)

37:13.204 --> 37:16.140
(Engine revving,
electronic beeping)

37:16.207 --> 37:19.176
(Tires squealing)

37:19.243 --> 37:20.244
(Beeping)

37:20.311 --> 37:22.179
(Tires squeal, cow moos)

37:22.246 --> 37:23.247
(Taps on door)

37:23.314 --> 37:25.216
(Pauses game)

37:25.282 --> 37:28.185
Oh, keep playing.
I just...

37:28.252 --> 37:29.253
I know it's late.

37:29.320 --> 37:33.157
I just wanted
to stop by and...

37:33.224 --> 37:36.193
Say thank you.

37:36.260 --> 37:39.230
I don't know if you had
anything to do with it,

37:39.296 --> 37:42.233
though I have a feeling
you did.

37:44.268 --> 37:46.170
You saved my ass.

37:46.237 --> 37:49.206
And everything else, too,
I hope.

37:49.273 --> 37:54.211
You were more of a friend
to me today than...

37:54.278 --> 37:57.181
I ever was to you.

37:57.248 --> 38:00.284
I owe you.

38:02.219 --> 38:05.289
And I won't forget that.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.293
That's all.

38:12.229 --> 38:15.199
How do you plan on
repaying me?

38:16.300 --> 38:19.170
'Cause as I recall...

38:19.236 --> 38:21.172
You know
some pretty neat tricks.

38:21.238 --> 38:25.176
As you recall?

38:25.242 --> 38:27.244
So what,
you remember me now?

38:27.311 --> 38:29.246
I remember everything,

38:29.313 --> 38:32.249
nola.

38:32.316 --> 38:35.152
I don't have amnesia.
I never did.

38:35.219 --> 38:38.222
What the hell, Jeremy?!
Yeah, what the hell? Ow!

38:38.289 --> 38:42.226
I've been making myself sick
worrying about you.
I wanted to tell you before,

38:42.293 --> 38:44.228
but there were
always people around.

38:44.295 --> 38:47.198
Do you know how hard it is
trying to pretend

38:47.264 --> 38:49.166
not to remember you?

38:49.233 --> 38:51.202
How could I forget you?

38:51.268 --> 38:53.237
Wait, so...
You've been pretending

38:53.304 --> 38:56.173
to be mentally challenged
for fun?

38:56.240 --> 38:58.242
(Chuckles) No. I'm staying
under the elder radar.

38:58.309 --> 39:01.145
Dude, you told me about
your brother,

39:01.212 --> 39:03.180
you said you wanted me
to help you.

39:03.247 --> 39:05.216
I tried going to see Nick,
but Simon caught me.

39:05.282 --> 39:07.218
I thought he was gonna
have me friggin' killed.

39:07.284 --> 39:09.220
You're probably not wrong
about that.
Right.

39:09.286 --> 39:13.190
So after I hit my head
and I woke up in the hospital,

39:13.257 --> 39:15.192
and they were asking me
all these questions,

39:15.259 --> 39:17.194
like what year is it,
what's your name,

39:17.261 --> 39:21.132
I saw my opportunity.
So you've been faking it
for a month?

39:21.198 --> 39:24.268
I figured there must be
some way to use this

39:24.335 --> 39:26.203
to our advantage, right?

39:26.270 --> 39:27.204
(Sighs)

39:27.271 --> 39:31.175
I want to help you
find your brother, nola.

39:31.242 --> 39:32.309
I really do.

39:39.283 --> 39:41.152
Karen Darling?

39:41.218 --> 39:44.221
You left our daughter
in the care of that spoiled,

39:44.288 --> 39:48.225
selfish,
emotionally stunted brat?

39:48.292 --> 39:52.163
For one hour, Lisa.
Why don't we all
have a seat?

39:52.229 --> 39:53.230
No, I won't be staying.

39:53.297 --> 39:56.133
Thank you.
You want 50% custody of Kiki?

39:56.200 --> 39:58.202
You couldn't even handle
two days with her.
Hey, calm down.

39:58.269 --> 40:00.204
Clearly you can't be trusted.

40:00.271 --> 40:03.240
Do you even know
what they did together?
Well, they weren't out
scoring coke,

40:03.307 --> 40:05.176
if that's your concern.

40:05.242 --> 40:07.178
Karen took her out
for an ice cream.

40:07.244 --> 40:10.181
Because you took off
and left her.
Well, something came up.

40:10.247 --> 40:12.183
Something always comes up,
Nick,

40:12.249 --> 40:15.186
and you always
put your family last.
That is not what this is about,
and you know it.

40:15.252 --> 40:18.189
When it comes to Karen,
you're irrational.

40:18.255 --> 40:20.157
Yeah? You want rational, Nick?

40:20.224 --> 40:21.225
Let's both be rational

40:21.292 --> 40:24.128
in front of a judge in court,

40:24.195 --> 40:26.197
where I sue your ass
for full primary custody

40:26.263 --> 40:28.165
of my daughter.

40:28.232 --> 40:30.267
Mediate that.

40:40.211 --> 40:43.247
You need to fix this place up.

40:43.314 --> 40:45.249
Tripp.

40:45.316 --> 40:48.219
This is a surprise.

40:48.285 --> 40:51.188
What can I do for you?

40:51.255 --> 40:55.259
Chase passed away
in his sleep last night.

40:57.294 --> 41:00.231
I got the call this morning.
How did that happen?

41:00.297 --> 41:04.135
Who knows
how these things happen?

41:04.201 --> 41:06.170
The animal finally...

41:06.237 --> 41:08.139
Gives up?

41:08.205 --> 41:10.207
But it was a blessing.

41:10.274 --> 41:12.209
Chase was an organ donor.

41:12.276 --> 41:16.147
He gave his kidney
to a little girl in Pittsburgh

41:16.213 --> 41:18.149
about Kiki's age.

41:18.215 --> 41:20.251
Saved her life.

41:20.317 --> 41:23.220
Hmm.

41:23.287 --> 41:25.256
And that's...

41:25.322 --> 41:27.224
Why you came by?

41:27.291 --> 41:29.260
No, of course not. (Sighs)

41:29.326 --> 41:32.229
You accused me...

41:32.296 --> 41:34.231
Once again,

41:34.298 --> 41:37.201
in so many words...

41:37.268 --> 41:39.236
Of having killed your father.

41:39.303 --> 41:43.207
And I have not been able to get
that moment out of my head.

41:43.274 --> 41:44.241
Tripp--

41:44.308 --> 41:48.179
Nick... your father
was my best friend.

41:48.245 --> 41:50.247
I never, ever wished ill
upon him.

41:50.314 --> 41:55.152
But since his death...

41:55.219 --> 41:57.221
Since I discovered
his betrayal of me,

41:57.288 --> 41:59.223
of the Darling family,

41:59.290 --> 42:02.159
of everything I hold dear...

42:02.226 --> 42:05.162
I admit that there has been

42:05.229 --> 42:08.165
more than one night
when I have lain awake

42:08.232 --> 42:10.167
wishing that it had been me

42:10.234 --> 42:12.236
who had taken his life,

42:12.303 --> 42:15.239
that I'd had the chance.

42:15.306 --> 42:18.209
But I didn't.

42:18.275 --> 42:21.145
I didn't do it.

42:21.212 --> 42:25.182
It may seem as if I did...

42:25.249 --> 42:28.285
But not everything
is as it seems.

42:32.289 --> 42:35.326
I believe you, Tripp.

42:37.294 --> 42:39.296
Have a good night.

42:44.235 --> 42:45.351
(Door slams)
