THOMAS LASKY:
This is a military academy.

00:13.050 --> 00:15.098
They're, uh, teaching us how to fight.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.052
My older brother, he trained here.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.550
You know, he was quite popular.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.562
He was a lot of the teachers' favorites.

00:28.650 --> 00:31.232

Socially, I don't think

00:41.790 --> 00:46.159
My name is Thomas Lasky,
and I'm a Cadet Freshman.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.218
The Academy's tough in itself.

00:48.290 --> 00:50.884
It's such a strict
and hostile environment.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.133
We're trying to learn
how to go in and battle

00:53.220 --> 00:56.087
and essentially kill somebody.

00:56.180 --> 01:00.264
My name is Michael Sullivan,
and I'm a Freshman Cadet.

01:00.350 --> 01:04.343
We're training
to ﬁght insurrectionists.

01:04.440 --> 01:08.149
I guess I'm following
the footsteps of my dad.

01:08.230 --> 01:10.198

I've never met him.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.898
WALTER:
My father is a chief financial advisor

01:12.990 --> 01:14.321
at Mezriah Weapons.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.152
I was always supposed
to come here.

01:16.240 --> 01:20.324
It was always something
that had been planned for me.

I am a Senior Cadet.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.417
I am the squad leader
for Hastati Squad.

01:30.460 --> 01:33.839
I was really looking for a place
where I can serve the UNSC,

01:33.920 --> 01:36.047
and Corbulo Academy is the best.

01:38.050 --> 01:39.790
I'm so new to everything.

01:39.890 --> 01:41.881
You know, I wasn't raised
in this kind of environment,

01:41.970 --> 01:43.346

of Military Science.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.239
I sort of always knew
that I wanted to be military.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.447
My mum taught me
how to hold a rifle when I was 10.

02:03.410 --> 02:08.006
DIMAH TCHAKOVA: This training,
it's part of who I am about to become.

but I think structure guides people.

I think it's hard, but too severe?

02:24.810 --> 02:27.187
No, I don't think it's too severe.

02:27.270 --> 02:28.737
If anything, it's not severe enough,

02:28.810 --> 02:30.471
and I don't think we're winning,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.404
and I think we need to do
everything possible to win.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.020
CHYLER:
It's not a game.

02:36.110 --> 02:37.828
It's training for life.

I need to be good at this,
because I believe in this war.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.618
THOMAS: I'm starting to think that
we could sort these things out

02:44.700 --> 02:46.918
without going into battle
and killing innocent people.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.457
I can't really say stuff
like that at this school,

02:49.540 --> 02:51.087
because people
kind of laugh at me,

02:51.170 --> 02:53.388
and they kind of bully me a bit.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.200
WALTER: What do I think
of the insurrectionists?

02:56.510 --> 02:57.841
I think they're selfish.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.763
You don't kill people
who aren't even fighting.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.250
It's not right.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.677
CHYLER: I grew up
around a lot of Innie violence,

03:04.760 --> 03:09.356
and not just violence
towards military targets.

03:09.430 --> 03:12.274
Civilians where I lived really had to learn
how to protect themselves.

03:12.350 --> 03:15.524
APRIL: Being a squad leader
means I am their leader.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.475
I'm responsible for them.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.858
They call me "The Robot"
behind my back, but I don't mind.

03:23.950 --> 03:27.795
I'm proud to do things
the Corbulo way, the UNSC way.

03:29.830 --> 03:30.956
WALTER: I don't think
we're supposed to fit in

03:31.040 --> 03:32.291
or necessarily make friends,

03:32.370 --> 03:34.213
as long as we work together
and we work hard

03:34.290 --> 03:35.666
and we do what
we're supposed to do.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.342
In that sense,
I feel like I fit in great.

03:37.420 --> 03:41.174

THOMAS: My brother always
thought I'd be a good soldier.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.060
CHYLER: Being a soldier
isn't about mindless violence.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.357
You need a clear head,

03:49.430 --> 03:53.139
and given the insurrectionists,
killing is part of that.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.431
SULLY: Would I be able
to take another life?

03:55.520 --> 03:57.442
WALTER:
Yeah, I'd be able to kill.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.613
After all, it's kill or be killed.

03:59.690 --> 04:02.113

like I'm ready to go into battle.

another human being ever.

the Roman's troops,

32:16.560 --> 32:19.859
Hannibal placed his spearmen
and slingers at the front.

Behind them, his swordsmen
flanked by cavalry.

32:22.850 --> 32:24.898
When the Romans attacked,

32:24.980 --> 32:27.221
Hannibal's swordsmen retreated.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.686
To the Romans,
that seemed to be due to their force,

32:29.780 --> 32:32.908
but in reality,
Hannibal had ordered the retreat.

32:32.990 --> 32:36.403
As the Romans continued
to drive the swordsmen back,

32:36.490 --> 32:40.335
Hannibal's cavalry
galloped in from behind.

32:40.410 --> 32:42.878
Once the attacking pincers connected,

32:42.960 --> 32:46.452
the Romans
were completely surrounded.

32:46.540 --> 32:48.963
This is an actual strategy?

32:49.050 --> 32:51.666
It does seem a little basic.

The Romans outnumbered
Hannibal's troops by over 10,000 strong,
