01:59.586 --> 02:01.379
You have anything to drink?

02:12.807 --> 02:14.518
Are you drinking there?

02:44.339 --> 02:45.173
Doctor!

02:46.299 --> 02:48.593
- Cover his head anyway.
- Do as he says.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.515
And what is this?
Get back down there.

02:54.850 --> 02:55.767
We knew him.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.520
- Get back... inside, both of you.
- I'd like to stay.

02:58.687 --> 03:02.691
If they notice we're up here, you'll
wish you were him if you don't already.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.193
We don't need the doctor.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.196
Go! We don't need you.
He's dead.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.784
I said he's dead.

03:12.868 --> 03:13.618
He's alive.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.370
If he's alive,
I'm treating him.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.081
Did anybody tell you
to get him?

03:18.456 --> 03:19.541
I didn't need to be told.

03:19.791 --> 03:21.751
Did anyone say
"Go for the doctor"?

03:23.753 --> 03:25.297
There's no point in arguing.

03:27.090 --> 03:27.924
You see.

03:32.470 --> 03:33.221
Done.

03:36.975 --> 03:37.684
What?

03:40.020 --> 03:40.729
Do it.

03:44.065 --> 03:45.817
No! Please, no!

03:47.068 --> 03:49.779
Easy, now. Easy.

04:12.093 --> 04:14.095
What he wanted, that's all.

04:22.229 --> 04:28.068
Don't come for me anymore.
Ask me for nothing.

04:31.613 --> 04:32.822
That's easy.

04:35.659 --> 04:37.369
Make sure
they get his number.

05:36.970 --> 05:37.929
Thank you.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.809
Take the pack.
They're Hungarian.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.103
I like our cigarettes.

05:45.353 --> 05:46.688
It's shit tobacco.

05:46.897 --> 05:48.023
I like ours.

05:49.399 --> 05:52.277
What they need to do is invade Turkey
and then you'll taste a cigarette.

05:53.695 --> 05:54.613
Get going.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.949
You trust the Poles?

05:58.450 --> 06:00.243
What do I care?
The Poles.

06:00.869 --> 06:03.997
They don't trust the Poles.
They don't trust anyone in Number3.

06:04.748 --> 06:05.665
Me?

06:05.874 --> 06:07.000
I can't say.

06:07.209 --> 06:08.502
I'm Hungarian.

06:08.710 --> 06:09.753
But you're here.

06:09.961 --> 06:11.630
So because I'm
with the Poles?

06:11.922 --> 06:14.424
Rosenthal's worried. He's gonna say
that we don't have the time.

06:14.633 --> 06:17.761
I know, we don't have time.
They wait for lulls.

06:18.470 --> 06:20.889
- If the front...
- That's not gonna happen for us.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.557
- No one really knows that...
- Never.

06:22.766 --> 06:24.142
There's planes almost
every day now.

06:24.309 --> 06:25.685
Not for us.

06:25.894 --> 06:30.190
The Russians get 10 km from here we're
the first to go right out to the pyres.

06:30.941 --> 06:32.567
Everyone keeps saying that.

06:32.776 --> 06:35.487
Believe it.
You're dead already, either way.

06:36.238 --> 06:38.156
It's just a matter
of deciding how.

06:39.074 --> 06:39.741
You have gold?

06:40.283 --> 06:42.077
Of course. So I say?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.454
Tell him it's not happening
is what you say.

06:45.497 --> 06:46.957
Get back and tell them.
Go!

07:16.736 --> 07:18.029
Move it out!

07:39.301 --> 07:42.429
It's all a way of putting it off.
Do you need to be here?

07:43.763 --> 07:45.557
Every day counts.

07:45.974 --> 07:49.102
They've been on just as long
as we have. They could go before us.

07:49.311 --> 07:51.897
- I don't understand him.
- He doesn't decide.

07:52.105 --> 07:55.150
He goes along. As far as
I'm concerned... He's no different.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.818
They'd heard
about the old man.

07:57.027 --> 07:59.112
- Who?
- Abramowics.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.115
- What'd he say?
- That... He'd heard.

08:02.324 --> 08:04.868
- Have you told anyone?
- Everyone knows.

08:07.579 --> 08:10.165
The Doctor had no business
there. A man takes pills.

08:10.373 --> 08:11.791
Why are you two in here?

08:12.334 --> 08:13.585
We're nearly finished.

08:14.794 --> 08:15.462
Nearly?

08:15.670 --> 08:16.755
Inside. Yes, nearly.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.924
- But not completely.
- I suppose not.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.800
So I ask the question again.

08:21.009 --> 08:23.094
Three of our men
were shot this morning.

08:23.220 --> 08:23.929
What business is it
of yours?

08:24.137 --> 08:26.431
We're gonna need replacements
and Hungarians.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.974
That's not your problem.

08:28.099 --> 08:32.062
You say we're lazy or disrespectful, but
don't leave us the manpower for the work.

08:32.687 --> 08:34.856
Moll shot Lowenthal,
one of our strongest men.

08:35.065 --> 08:37.775
- You want things to go fast?
- If it's my neck.

08:39.193 --> 08:40.403
We're going to be moving...

08:43.198 --> 08:44.866
Why do you want to do that?

08:45.200 --> 08:46.952
We're thinking of a reprieve.

08:47.911 --> 08:49.913
Our group is happy
to remain here.

08:49.996 --> 08:50.831
Happy?

08:51.039 --> 08:55.210
Why kill us now? We're
the best kommando you've had.

08:55.460 --> 08:56.545
Did I say kill?

08:57.087 --> 08:58.630
We both know
what we're saying.

08:58.964 --> 09:00.215
So I'm a liar.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.676
You're what you are.

09:02.926 --> 09:03.969
It's not my decision.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.136
Of course it's your decision.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.680
No one is
to leave their areas.

09:06.888 --> 09:08.557
You're telling me it's not
you're decision?

09:09.182 --> 09:11.268
No one is to leave
their areas.

09:11.476 --> 09:13.854
- The Doctor leaves.
- The Doctor is different.

09:14.104 --> 09:15.730
There've been people
in the zones.

09:15.939 --> 09:16.982
We haven't been.

09:17.107 --> 09:18.650
We know what we see.

09:19.192 --> 09:23.780
You're to keep with your units.
Each to each building.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.074
- The bribes are taken.
- Nevertheless.

09:26.491 --> 09:28.285
But we're going
to need replacements.

09:28.493 --> 09:29.536
Get back inside!

09:30.370 --> 09:32.122
Or I'll be replacing you.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.497
We missed you this morning.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.290
Missed me?

10:15.999 --> 10:19.002
- The data are on your desk.
- Good.

10:21.004 --> 10:23.715
We've arranged for more forms.
You should have said.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.218
- I'm sorry we had to ask.
- Please.

10:27.135 --> 10:29.596
- What about the lenses?
- They're on the way.

10:38.230 --> 10:40.190
You are an astonishing
pathologist.

10:40.732 --> 10:41.775
Thank you.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.444
- That's not easy for you to hear.
- It isn't.

10:45.111 --> 10:51.368
Something in you knows that our
situation is unique.

10:53.245 --> 10:56.665
And as a scientist, you are
as true a one as I've known.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.709
You understand...

11:00.544 --> 11:03.547
...that when I'm sure every cell in your
body tells you to do otherwise.

11:03.755 --> 11:04.589
They do.

11:13.181 --> 11:15.058
This isn't our war.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.601
Not mine.

11:17.435 --> 11:19.604
Nor mine, I can assure you.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.692
But to allow this all
to go to waist.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.777
I understand your position.

11:26.528 --> 11:28.488
Clearly, you do more than that.

11:28.780 --> 11:29.948
As you wish.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.324
Meaning?

11:33.451 --> 11:35.036
There is no meaning.

11:42.252 --> 11:45.672
We're going to be increasing
the volume of our research.

12:04.774 --> 12:06.359
I shall need more staff.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.071
Then you shall have more staff.

12:15.702 --> 12:16.745
Yes?

12:17.704 --> 12:19.581
- Pardon?
- You want to say...

12:20.415 --> 12:21.750
- It's...
- Yes?

12:24.794 --> 12:27.088
We had discussed last time.

12:29.174 --> 12:30.300
Of course.

12:49.653 --> 12:51.488
This gets you anywhere
in the camp.

14:19.367 --> 14:21.161
- You wait until now?
- Me?

14:22.496 --> 14:24.831
- This is too wrapped up.
- I got it that way.

14:25.499 --> 14:27.959
- From whom?
- I never saw her face.

14:28.126 --> 14:29.085
Where's Tsipora?

14:29.544 --> 14:30.670
Where is she?

14:40.347 --> 14:41.097
And?

14:41.598 --> 14:43.558
And that's all I know.
I'd never seen her before.

14:44.309 --> 14:46.186
- But they have her.
- I said that's all I know.

14:46.394 --> 14:48.188
There's no way they don't.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.899
I know Tsipora. They won't get
a thing out of her.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.401
It doesn't matter.
The point is keep going.

14:53.485 --> 14:56.905
They'll find us like they found her
and until then we get in.

14:57.155 --> 14:59.115
It's hard to guarantee
how much we'll get anymore.

14:59.324 --> 15:01.409
This is a chain.
You find another link.

15:01.618 --> 15:03.912
I just said we did.
We found a stupid link.

15:03.995 --> 15:05.247
So what's the trouble?

15:05.580 --> 15:07.165
You don't walk out
of there everyday.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.500
I do plenty more than that.

15:08.625 --> 15:09.543
This isn't a contest.

15:09.751 --> 15:13.630
Then don't make it one.
I'm prepared for anything, Dina.

15:13.797 --> 15:16.091
- And so am I.
- You should be.

15:16.842 --> 15:18.385
So, is there a problem?

15:18.510 --> 15:21.429
If they find us, what do they
do with the rest of our group?

15:21.638 --> 15:23.306
You're risking your own life.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.392
Why should we risk theirs?

15:26.476 --> 15:28.603
You both act
like we put everyone in here.

15:28.854 --> 15:32.148
I don't make you do anything.
Be like them, both of you.

15:32.357 --> 15:34.150
That isn't
what she's saying.

15:34.442 --> 15:37.904
The whole barracks will be punished.
They'll be before they're killed.

15:38.113 --> 15:39.155
Just like us.

15:39.364 --> 15:41.157
What's the fucking difference
when you're dead anyway?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.326
We made the choice,
they haven't.

15:43.535 --> 15:44.870
I'm not listening
to this anymore.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.497
Make sure these get into the cart.
How many bodies are there?

15:47.706 --> 15:48.623
Eight.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.500
You see, that's good.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.711
The more bodies the better.
Get it?

15:54.379 --> 15:55.839
I'll just take these two.

16:00.844 --> 16:01.887
Idiots.

16:08.768 --> 16:09.811
Is she right?

16:11.062 --> 16:12.397
Of course she's right.

16:12.856 --> 16:15.525
What have you been thinking
for the past two months?

16:16.401 --> 16:18.904
I just wish I could slap the shit
out of her is all.

18:48.803 --> 18:50.222
Ist ein problem?

18:50.388 --> 18:51.640
Ist ein problem?

18:51.848 --> 18:52.974
Keine Problem.

19:30.220 --> 19:34.307
I feel sorry for the world
if we don't win the war.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.268
It's your position.

19:36.685 --> 19:39.396
Men are tribal.
We'll end that.

19:39.813 --> 19:42.649
There'll be one tribe.
No war.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.735
There've been wars
within your tribe.

19:46.194 --> 19:46.987
Yes?

19:47.529 --> 19:50.365
Rhoem? The Night
of the Long Knives.

19:50.574 --> 19:52.242
You know a good deal
about Germany.

19:54.369 --> 19:56.163
That, of course,
was a putsch.

19:56.413 --> 19:57.372
What's the difference?

19:58.248 --> 19:59.749
A putsch is not a war.

19:59.958 --> 20:01.293
It's a kind of war.

20:01.459 --> 20:05.338
It's a putsch. If it meant war,
the word would be unnecessary.

20:05.881 --> 20:08.258
Why have two words
for the same thing?

20:08.925 --> 20:10.677
I'm German, you're Hungarian.

20:10.886 --> 20:14.014
I should think I'd be the authority
in this room on the German language.

20:14.222 --> 20:15.265
Of course.

20:16.808 --> 20:18.894
In spite of your obvious
intelligence.

20:19.644 --> 20:20.478
Of course.

20:25.275 --> 20:29.654
There's a rumour around the Number3
Crematorium there'll be a rebellion.

20:31.740 --> 20:32.782
The Number 3?

20:33.617 --> 20:35.410
That would involve the First.

20:36.036 --> 20:39.956
That would involve all 4, originating
with the Poles in Number 3.

20:41.750 --> 20:42.792
What would I know?

20:43.335 --> 20:44.961
They think we're going
to kill them.

20:45.170 --> 20:46.463
Don't you always?

20:47.214 --> 20:49.424
This is the best kommando
we've had.

20:49.966 --> 20:50.717
Alright.

20:51.968 --> 20:53.011
You let them know that.

20:53.220 --> 20:54.262
They don't trust me.

20:54.471 --> 20:55.847
You're their doctor.

20:55.931 --> 20:57.807
I'm their doctor
but they know what I do.

20:58.016 --> 20:59.142
What do they do?

20:59.351 --> 21:01.019
They work under gunpoint.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.313
I won't tell them
what I don't believe.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.606
That we'll let them live?

21:05.190 --> 21:06.441
That you'll let any
of us live.

21:07.192 --> 21:10.403
What happens to you has little
to do with me.

21:11.238 --> 21:14.074
You're treated well.
Better than anyone.

21:15.116 --> 21:16.660
You should let us know.

21:16.910 --> 21:18.829
- They're not going to...
- If you hear anything.

21:19.204 --> 21:20.247
That's all.

21:26.878 --> 21:31.591
Did you ever consider, Herr
Oberschaarfuhere, that these...

21:31.675 --> 21:33.218
...headaches might be related...

21:36.596 --> 21:37.556
Yes?

21:38.765 --> 21:43.895
...to the increase, lately,
in the level of cargo.

21:47.023 --> 21:47.858
Go on.

21:49.943 --> 21:54.322
What I see in the courtyard, if
I just crack the window for some air.

21:55.699 --> 21:57.242
Anyone would have difficulty.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.953
You shouldn't be looking
out of windows.

22:00.162 --> 22:04.332
- I'm only suggesting...
- Your job is to diagnose.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.209
Alright.

22:06.960 --> 22:11.631
If I get upset, if my head aches,
it's because I drink too much.

22:12.174 --> 22:13.508
Then don't drink so much.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.302
That's right,
I won't drink so much.

22:15.594 --> 22:17.929
But that too should stay
between you and me.

22:18.096 --> 22:20.473
- I would never...
- That's right, you would never.

22:21.016 --> 22:23.226
Because you're just
as disposable as I am.

22:23.977 --> 22:25.812
- Herr...
- I don't care! Shut up!

22:26.438 --> 22:27.772
I don't care.

22:28.523 --> 22:30.692
We're each of us a part of it.

22:31.234 --> 22:33.528
Once any of you decide
to live this way.

22:34.279 --> 22:35.822
And you especially.

22:36.865 --> 22:38.950
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

22:39.868 --> 22:41.953
Once you make that choice.

24:35.108 --> 24:36.443
About half are in.

24:37.736 --> 24:38.528
Yes?

26:21.882 --> 26:24.342
Max, you'll botch this.
We don't have any choice.

26:24.593 --> 26:25.844
It started with them.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.013
So a bunch of Poles
from Number 3 get to decide.

26:28.221 --> 26:30.849
They get to stall it until it's right
for them, and it's our people.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.309
Who is our people?

26:32.392 --> 26:33.685
On the fucking trains.

26:33.894 --> 26:35.228
- Because they're Hungarian?
- Yes.

26:35.478 --> 26:38.982
That's because Hungary's the only
country with any Jews left.

26:39.399 --> 26:40.525
But that's your reason?

26:40.859 --> 26:43.069
If we were burning Polish
Jews you wouldn't care?

26:43.236 --> 26:46.364
If we were burning Polish Jews
we wouldn't be waiting.

26:46.573 --> 26:48.450
What's another week
to these guys?

26:48.783 --> 26:50.452
Another ten thousand Hungarians?

26:50.660 --> 26:52.746
They don't care about us.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.498
We're all after
the same thing, Max.

26:54.706 --> 26:56.082
It doesn't seem like it.

26:58.668 --> 26:59.628
Here he is.

27:03.131 --> 27:05.592
Sorry.
It was hell getting over.

27:06.218 --> 27:07.552
How is it over there?

27:08.512 --> 27:09.846
They're locking us all in.

27:10.222 --> 27:12.015
- Who said?
- Lopkowitz.

27:12.182 --> 27:13.600
They're getting ready
to liquidate another section.

27:13.808 --> 27:14.851
Which one?

27:14.935 --> 27:18.271
I'd guess one of the Czechs. Better for
them, anyway. They're all starving.

27:18.522 --> 27:19.773
Give me some vodka.

27:25.695 --> 27:26.655
What's this?

27:27.239 --> 27:29.241
Hungarian wine.
We got it in today.

27:29.533 --> 27:30.700
Any gold?

27:31.201 --> 27:32.661
They haven't come back yet.

27:36.873 --> 27:37.791
Look here.

27:40.293 --> 27:41.545
Check out the diamonds.

27:42.379 --> 27:43.421
Lovely.

27:43.630 --> 27:45.507
- I was gonna get it smelted, but...
- But what?

27:46.758 --> 27:47.676
Smelt it.

27:47.926 --> 27:48.718
Fine.

27:50.220 --> 27:54.015
Looks like we got some god food in.
Smoked oysters, meats, a few cakes.

27:54.266 --> 27:55.517
We should do alright tonight.

27:55.725 --> 27:57.519
We hear you got
more machine guns.

27:58.436 --> 28:00.730
- Who told you?
- Hoffman found out.

28:01.022 --> 28:03.066
- Were you gonna tell us?
- Of course.

28:03.191 --> 28:05.151
Doesn't seem like it.
He just said explosives.

28:05.193 --> 28:05.944
No.

28:06.361 --> 28:08.238
Why do you think I came?

28:08.321 --> 28:10.448
Because Hoffman told you
to come.

28:10.657 --> 28:12.242
No. I told Hoffman.

28:13.660 --> 28:16.788
They were left inside the fence by
the partisans. And twenty grenades.

28:16.997 --> 28:18.373
Who has them now?

28:18.582 --> 28:19.291
We do.

28:19.499 --> 28:22.752
So we don't give any more of ours,
you guys are better off now.

28:22.961 --> 28:24.921
When did we ever need
from you?

28:25.130 --> 28:27.215
So what's this business
about waiting?

28:27.424 --> 28:29.384
- We have to re-coordinate.
- Why?

28:30.051 --> 28:31.261
I don't like the way
you talk with me.

28:31.469 --> 28:32.429
You don't like
the way I talk?

28:32.637 --> 28:33.346
I don't like
the way he talks.

28:33.597 --> 28:35.891
Wait, you don't like the way I talk?
It's difficult to understand?

28:39.019 --> 28:41.188
Why are we re-coordinating?

28:41.479 --> 28:42.439
Again.

28:42.647 --> 28:44.733
- We have more guns.
- We had guns.

28:45.150 --> 28:47.736
You think the partisans aren't
wondering why we've done nothing?

28:47.903 --> 28:50.155
You think the women aren't wondering
with the powder they've got in?

28:50.363 --> 28:52.032
- The machine guns.
- So?

28:53.992 --> 28:54.826
What?

28:55.785 --> 28:56.620
Escape.

28:59.456 --> 29:01.333
Wait. Who? Us?

29:02.042 --> 29:05.879
You think you think
we'll escape?

29:06.087 --> 29:07.130
With guns.

29:07.255 --> 29:09.758
So we kill more of them.
Destroy three of the crematorium.

29:09.966 --> 29:10.717
And get out.

29:10.884 --> 29:12.135
Is that what you're after?

29:12.385 --> 29:13.720
If I get the chance,
fuck yes.

29:14.012 --> 29:16.932
You tell them, if this is
about escape, we're out.

29:17.057 --> 29:18.475
How can you speak
for all of us?

29:18.725 --> 29:20.060
You gonna speak for yourself?

29:20.268 --> 29:21.019
Are you serious?

29:21.228 --> 29:22.812
What, you're gonna go back
to your normal life?

29:23.021 --> 29:25.065
Forget that. The point
is it doesn't make any sense.

29:25.565 --> 29:26.775
You live to tell.

29:26.858 --> 29:29.611
You're not going to live.
You won't make it to the Vistula.

29:29.736 --> 29:31.154
Others have made it.

29:31.238 --> 29:33.406
Others from the camp,
not from the kommandos.

29:34.366 --> 29:36.660
They'll give up on someone
from Buna, or the camp...

29:37.077 --> 29:39.579
...but not anyone who's been
inside the crematorium.

29:40.121 --> 29:42.374
What we could tell they'll
turn Poland upside down.

29:43.625 --> 29:46.753
If we want to accomplish anything,
it has to be one thing.

29:47.003 --> 29:48.046
One end.

29:48.547 --> 29:49.881
And that's the machinery.

29:50.215 --> 29:51.675
You've got to tell them this.

29:51.883 --> 29:54.094
And there's no time left.
Do they know that?

29:54.302 --> 29:56.388
Kommando 8 lasted
three months and a week.

29:56.471 --> 29:58.682
Not with this kind of cargo.
Even Moll admits...

29:58.849 --> 30:01.601
Moll's not going to tell you.
And with them locking us in,...

30:03.770 --> 30:05.772
Do you hear this?
You don't even speak German.

30:05.856 --> 30:06.982
What the fuck does
that matter?

30:07.190 --> 30:09.067
I speak enough.
And I speak Yiddish.

30:09.276 --> 30:11.695
- You speak Yiddish?
- From the Poles.

30:11.903 --> 30:13.446
You heard from the Poles!

30:13.697 --> 30:14.489
Shut up!

30:17.951 --> 30:21.830
Mussfeld told me they
are getting ready to move us.

30:22.956 --> 30:25.876
No group has lasted more
than four months.

30:26.001 --> 30:27.878
- All he's saying is...
- I know what he's saying.

30:27.961 --> 30:29.504
We could be massacred waiting...

30:29.754 --> 30:31.089
...like every other group,
thinking we're different.

30:32.424 --> 30:34.634
Which'll be worse even
than ting to escape.

30:35.802 --> 30:38.805
We can tell them
we can work this out.

30:39.848 --> 30:41.808
But it has
to be the crematorium.

30:42.058 --> 30:45.270
Then they can do whatever they want.
You can run to high heaven.

30:45.687 --> 30:47.480
But after we've done
the buildings.

30:50.275 --> 30:51.943
I'd like a bottle
of that wine.

30:52.569 --> 30:54.029
Give us the necklace.

30:54.196 --> 30:54.946
Oh, c'mon.

30:55.155 --> 30:56.823
It's good wine,
you fucking Yid.

30:57.699 --> 31:01.536
You won't get that smelted and it'll be of
no use. We can get something for it.

31:02.245 --> 31:04.456
- Two bottles.
- Fuck you.

31:06.416 --> 31:07.792
Hoffman, give him two bottles.

31:20.514 --> 31:21.681
Be careful.

31:25.602 --> 31:26.686
They're liars.

31:27.187 --> 31:28.438
What are they gonna lie about?

31:28.522 --> 31:30.398
He wanted to keep the necklace.

31:31.274 --> 31:35.612
He thinks he's going to live.
We're a fucking diversion.

31:37.405 --> 31:38.657
These are Jews.

31:39.282 --> 31:40.742
You keep saying that, Simon.

31:42.077 --> 31:43.745
You trust Jews anymore?

31:49.292 --> 31:50.836
No one would make it?

31:52.629 --> 31:54.089
Suppose even you do.

31:55.674 --> 31:59.177
Do you want to look anyone in the face
if any of your family's even alive?

32:00.971 --> 32:03.139
What you've done
For a little more life.

32:04.474 --> 32:06.518
For vodka and bed linens.

36:07.050 --> 36:08.009
Anja, listen to me...

36:08.301 --> 36:10.303
...you're gonna die anyway.
We're dead.

36:10.595 --> 36:11.721
They'll find the powder.

36:12.264 --> 36:13.223
Don't say anything.

36:13.390 --> 36:15.308
No matter what they do.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.893
Don't say anything.

36:17.394 --> 36:18.436
I love you.

37:12.532 --> 37:16.495
This process of disinfecting is of
vital importance to your health.

37:16.703 --> 37:18.371
One louse can kill you.

37:19.623 --> 37:21.416
Cleanliness brings freedom.

37:21.708 --> 37:22.959
You're all fine.

37:23.376 --> 37:26.421
The quicker you get undressed, the
quicker you'll be cleaned, settled...

37:26.630 --> 37:28.507
...and reunited
with your families.

37:28.882 --> 37:30.050
Filthy liar.

37:30.967 --> 37:33.512
Remember the number of the hook
you hang your clothes on.

37:33.720 --> 37:34.763
He's a liar.

37:35.055 --> 37:36.723
I can't believe it's
Jews doing this.

37:36.932 --> 37:39.851
He's lying everyone.
He's a liar.

37:40.060 --> 37:40.894
Stop it.

37:41.937 --> 37:43.605
You should listen
to your wife.

37:44.022 --> 37:46.191
Think what you want to think,
but don't cause trouble.

37:46.650 --> 37:48.652
- I'm causing trouble?
- Please.

37:50.278 --> 37:52.781
Look me in the eye and tell me
I'm not gonna be killed.

37:53.698 --> 37:57.369
Hang your clothes on the hooks and keep
them separate from your neighbours.

37:57.744 --> 37:59.538
I'm gonna die, but I'll have lived
longer than you ever will.

37:59.663 --> 38:00.831
You're dead already.

38:01.331 --> 38:04.918
Be quiet. You think you're
gonna change something?

38:05.085 --> 38:08.213
- That's right, what does it matter?
- At least I'll die with my dignity.

38:08.421 --> 38:09.464
- Morris.
- Stop it!

38:09.673 --> 38:12.384
At least I'll die
with my dignity.

38:12.676 --> 38:14.386
How'd you get through
with herewith that?

38:15.595 --> 38:16.471
What?

38:16.638 --> 38:17.514
The watch, is what.

38:17.889 --> 38:19.766
They'd have killed your whole car.

38:20.267 --> 38:21.309
What does it matter?

38:21.852 --> 38:25.105
See what you've done for yourself
now? Give me the watch.

38:26.356 --> 38:27.065
Why?

38:27.232 --> 38:28.650
Give it to me.
You're bathing.

38:28.859 --> 38:30.443
Why do you need the watch
in there?

38:30.652 --> 38:32.529
Get it from me after
of the Nazis will.

38:32.612 --> 38:34.990
- Do as he says, Morris.
- We always do what everyone says.

38:35.532 --> 38:37.200
I'm not giving you anything.

38:38.994 --> 38:40.537
You're attracting
more attention.

38:41.163 --> 38:43.248
Tell me, tell me I'm gonna live,
you fucking Nazi.

38:43.623 --> 38:45.041
Tell me I'm gonna live.

38:45.208 --> 38:45.876
Morris, give him the watch.

38:45.959 --> 38:46.918
He's a liar, everyone.

38:47.419 --> 38:49.379
These Jews are all Nazi liars.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.381
And now he wants
to steal my watch.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.049
- Give me the watch!
- No.

38:53.258 --> 38:54.718
All I want is the fucking watch!

38:55.135 --> 38:55.886
No!

38:57.012 --> 38:58.763
No! Give him the watch!

40:13.004 --> 40:14.339
Alright, let's keep it moving.

40:16.049 --> 40:18.343
Remember what hooks you hang
your clothes on.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.805
The hooks are numbered. You'll need
to return once you've showered.

40:22.430 --> 40:25.225
Keep your shoes tied together by
their laces so you don't lose them.

40:25.767 --> 40:28.770
The sooner you shower, the sooner
you'll be fed and reunited.

40:29.437 --> 40:31.147
Move it, move it!

40:34.818 --> 40:36.611
Keep moving inside.

40:37.571 --> 40:38.363
Move it!

40:42.951 --> 40:44.703
Move it! Move it!

40:45.453 --> 40:46.496
David.

40:47.831 --> 40:48.790
Stay.

40:49.833 --> 40:50.959
David?

41:59.778 --> 42:01.071
Do you want a drink?

42:01.988 --> 42:03.156
No, thank you.

42:06.034 --> 42:07.911
- You have work.
- Yes.

42:32.018 --> 42:33.562
Always so young.

42:34.229 --> 42:37.232
Adult siblings move away
from one another.

42:38.859 --> 42:40.819
- How's it going?
- Alright.

42:45.157 --> 42:48.410
He'll make twins?
With German women?

42:49.536 --> 42:50.787
That's the goal.

42:53.206 --> 42:54.457
What's this?

42:55.375 --> 42:56.710
A gall stone.

42:57.127 --> 42:58.795
What are you keeping it for?

42:59.546 --> 43:01.631
He takes an interest
in such things.

43:04.843 --> 43:07.304
- He collects them?
- I suppose.

43:07.804 --> 43:08.722
In jars?

43:09.139 --> 43:13.101
That's how I'm giving it to him. What
he does with it after is his business.

43:18.732 --> 43:20.817
So, have you heard anything?

43:21.318 --> 43:22.652
Heard anything?

43:23.695 --> 43:25.280
- I mentioned last time.
- I told you...

43:26.698 --> 43:27.491
Yes?

43:27.699 --> 43:29.075
They don't speak to me.

43:34.164 --> 43:35.874
You found your wife and daughter.

43:37.292 --> 43:38.752
Who told you?

43:39.294 --> 43:40.420
Does it matter?

43:40.837 --> 43:42.214
I don't suppose.

43:42.506 --> 43:45.634
You've been several times.
Brought blankets, medicine.

43:45.842 --> 43:46.551
Yes.

43:48.094 --> 43:49.513
In C-camp, is it?

43:49.804 --> 43:51.223
- He gave you a pass.
- Yes.

43:53.350 --> 43:55.143
What did you think
of it over there?

43:56.478 --> 43:57.437
Think?

43:58.355 --> 44:00.023
Did you tell them
what goes on here?

44:00.440 --> 44:01.817
Of course not.

44:02.108 --> 44:03.568
Do they have any idea?

44:03.777 --> 44:05.403
How couldn't they?
Everyone talks.

44:06.696 --> 44:08.990
- You denied it.
- I did.

44:11.159 --> 44:12.327
It's best.

44:17.582 --> 44:19.751
They're going
to be liquidating C-camp.

44:20.126 --> 44:21.294
Who said?

44:21.711 --> 44:23.922
Cuts in administration.

44:24.422 --> 44:26.091
There's not enough food.

44:26.925 --> 44:28.593
In the next two weeks.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.262
We dispose of food.

44:30.470 --> 44:31.847
The order is the order.

44:32.931 --> 44:34.432
The entire section.

44:34.891 --> 44:35.934
Two weeks?

44:36.101 --> 44:36.810
That's what I said.

44:37.894 --> 44:39.020
I'll speak with...

44:39.229 --> 44:40.897
What does he have to do
with who stays and who goes?

44:42.357 --> 44:44.151
What does he have to do?...

44:44.234 --> 44:45.777
Because he gave you a pass?

44:45.986 --> 44:48.071
I can assure you it
won't be allowed.

44:52.033 --> 44:54.327
It will be easy to save them.

44:55.287 --> 44:58.540
If there is an uprising
in this camp there will be a massacre...

44:58.832 --> 45:00.709
...that will far outweigh
anything done to us.

45:01.376 --> 45:02.919
These men will suffer.

45:03.420 --> 45:05.172
That's a strange remark.

45:05.380 --> 45:06.756
We let them live.

45:07.048 --> 45:08.091
For a time.

45:11.136 --> 45:12.387
Even if I...
they don't.

45:13.430 --> 45:15.098
Someone will speak.

45:15.932 --> 45:17.392
I want to know you'll help me.

45:20.395 --> 45:21.688
If I'm spoken to.

45:22.272 --> 45:23.773
Whatever you hear.

45:25.942 --> 45:26.776
Yes.

45:27.486 --> 45:28.445
Good.

45:30.405 --> 45:33.241
As for your wife and daughter...

45:34.493 --> 45:36.870
we must go to KZ Administration
and get them transferred.

45:37.204 --> 45:38.038
How?

45:38.538 --> 45:40.624
Find out which are
the safe convoys out.

45:41.791 --> 45:43.960
They're sending some west
to the munitions factory.

45:45.253 --> 45:47.547
Have them volunteer.
They will be chosen.

45:47.923 --> 45:48.965
It's safe?

45:50.342 --> 45:52.302
I'm telling you I will make it safe.

45:52.844 --> 45:54.638
That's what I'll do for you.

45:55.138 --> 45:57.349
They must keep it a secret,
though.

45:58.433 --> 46:00.477
- If everyone volunteers...
- I know.

46:00.769 --> 46:02.979
They save themselves,
that's all.

46:04.731 --> 46:05.899
Just like you.

46:07.442 --> 46:09.528
You and your gall stone.

46:10.987 --> 46:13.156
Your gall stone of a Jew.

46:42.686 --> 46:44.855
How did you get the powder
from the plant?

46:58.743 --> 47:00.954
How did you get the powder
from the plant?

47:01.538 --> 47:03.415
It doesn't matter how they
got the fucking powder.

47:04.082 --> 47:06.251
What we need to know
is where it's headed.

47:06.459 --> 47:08.044
I'm asking her that.

47:08.336 --> 47:10.213
You think I don't have ears?

47:11.464 --> 47:16.261
You're asking her where it came
from. It came from the plant.

47:16.553 --> 47:18.054
The plant wants to know.

47:18.263 --> 47:19.806
Of course the plant wants
to know.

47:20.432 --> 47:22.517
They should have wondered
that before it happened.

47:24.102 --> 47:27.522
You'll kill this one, too before
she tells us who has it now.

47:37.532 --> 47:39.201
Where was the powder headed?

47:44.748 --> 47:46.625
Where was the powder headed?

47:53.256 --> 47:54.758
This is what you want?

48:02.432 --> 48:03.934
You're going to kill me anyway.

48:04.434 --> 48:05.894
You won't be so lucky.

48:07.437 --> 48:11.316
We will do worse to your entire
block, after we're done with you.

48:15.195 --> 48:18.824
Why don't you just gas them?

48:23.995 --> 48:24.955
Revive her.

49:39.738 --> 49:41.072
I got the girl.

49:41.531 --> 49:42.657
You two got a date?

49:42.949 --> 49:44.326
I said take the fucking body.

50:12.479 --> 50:13.814
Why are you up here?

50:14.356 --> 50:15.690
There's a girl...

50:16.441 --> 50:17.692
I said what are you doing
up here?

50:18.068 --> 50:20.612
There's a young girl on that cart
who survived the gas.

50:21.154 --> 50:23.657
She's still breathing.
She'll be burned alive.

50:34.793 --> 50:35.919
We're taking this one.

50:36.044 --> 50:37.087
What do you mean, taking?

50:37.337 --> 50:38.380
I mean taking the body.

50:38.421 --> 50:39.256
Let me get the hair.

50:39.548 --> 50:41.800
I said we're taking her,
hair and all.

50:41.883 --> 50:44.261
If she leaves with hair,
I need to know why.

50:44.511 --> 50:45.428
She's a twin.

50:45.637 --> 50:46.137
What's the trouble?

50:46.346 --> 50:48.223
I need this body
for the Doctor.

50:48.431 --> 50:49.474
So let him get the hair.

50:49.724 --> 50:52.602
What is it with you people?
We're taking now, with the hair.

50:52.853 --> 50:54.104
If she's a twin,
where's the other one?

50:54.271 --> 50:56.565
The other one was caught
before she got on the lift.

50:57.107 --> 51:00.235
And why was she killed?
I thought they were taken alive.

51:00.819 --> 51:02.404
Are you saying I'm lying?

51:03.071 --> 51:04.990
I've kept this unit alive
nine months.

51:05.157 --> 51:05.991
What do I care?

51:06.032 --> 51:07.617
So you're alive.
We're all alive.

51:07.826 --> 51:09.828
We're all shitting gold.
Make your fucking point.

51:10.036 --> 51:11.079
I don't want trouble.

51:11.288 --> 51:14.624
If you want trouble, send me down
to the Doctor with her head shaved.

51:20.463 --> 51:22.674
Take her. What do I care.

51:23.592 --> 51:24.426
Help them.

51:24.634 --> 51:26.636
No, we've got her.
I said we fucking have her.

51:32.559 --> 51:33.602
This will foul everything.

51:33.810 --> 51:34.853
It's blood on our hands.

51:35.061 --> 51:36.730
It's a goddam distraction.
And what do we do with her?

51:36.938 --> 51:37.981
We figure that out.

51:38.064 --> 51:38.940
We'll have to hide her.

51:39.107 --> 51:41.109
And not just from them,
but from some of us, too.

51:41.318 --> 51:43.069
We do not have time
to be dealing with this.

51:47.157 --> 51:48.283
She was inside.

51:48.408 --> 51:50.911
It'll be and she'll never make it.
What are you thinking?

51:51.119 --> 51:52.579
I'm not going to kill her,
alright?

51:52.787 --> 51:56.541
Just think if they found her
in the barracks, which they will...

51:56.875 --> 51:58.210
...because you'll never keep her
without it'll be worse.

51:58.418 --> 51:59.544
How can that be worse?

51:59.753 --> 52:00.378
Worse for her.

52:00.504 --> 52:01.922
Forgetting
what they'll do to us.

52:02.172 --> 52:05.425
She's not even conscious. She goes
the way she would have gone.

52:05.592 --> 52:07.135
Meet us at the store room.

52:07.802 --> 52:08.720
I can stop you, Max.

52:08.929 --> 52:10.180
Stop me, then. Do it!

52:10.597 --> 52:12.182
You know we're not killing her.

52:20.524 --> 52:21.691
Where's Schlermer?

52:21.858 --> 52:22.526
Down the corridor.

52:22.734 --> 52:23.235
Where's she?

52:23.443 --> 52:25.195
He won't bring her in until
he talks with the Doctor.

52:25.403 --> 52:26.780
Why? Get him.

52:26.863 --> 52:28.031
Who's gonna watch?

52:28.114 --> 52:29.908
What's to watch?
There's no one in the hall.

52:29.991 --> 52:31.159
He won't let anyone near her.

52:31.243 --> 52:32.077
You'd better get her in here.

52:32.285 --> 52:32.953
Go.

52:36.248 --> 52:38.792
I know what you think.
It's not the same.

52:39.835 --> 52:40.961
He's scared.

52:41.169 --> 52:42.420
We'll put her on this table.

52:42.629 --> 52:43.880
If anyone were to find out...

52:44.089 --> 52:44.840
I know.

52:45.048 --> 52:46.258
We're not murderers.

52:46.466 --> 52:47.300
I know that.

52:50.637 --> 52:51.471
We're sorry.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.682
I hadn't been here long enough.

52:54.850 --> 52:57.018
- I'm talking about...
- I know what you're talking about.

52:57.227 --> 52:59.229
- Of course.
- It doesn't mean I'd act differently.

52:59.437 --> 53:01.898
I've aborted suicides before
and would again.

53:02.149 --> 53:05.485
- I understand.
- Anywhere.

53:05.652 --> 53:06.403
I didn't.

53:06.611 --> 53:07.445
I was summoned.

53:07.654 --> 53:08.405
Not by me.

53:09.322 --> 53:12.659
After midnight like this, to watch
what amounted to a murder.

53:14.286 --> 53:16.830
Something I hardly need
to be woken for in this place.

53:17.455 --> 53:18.165
I'm sorry.

53:18.415 --> 53:20.375
- It's not how we...
- Then don't call for me.

53:21.835 --> 53:22.878
I'm sorry.

53:23.295 --> 53:25.922
- And you exclude me.
- Exclude you?

53:26.214 --> 53:27.883
I don't know why you do that.

53:31.011 --> 53:32.137
He told you?

53:32.512 --> 53:33.305
Yes.

53:33.597 --> 53:34.973
That there's no point.

53:35.182 --> 53:36.641
I can't know
until you bring her in.

53:36.850 --> 53:39.227
If there's no hope,
if she's dead already...

53:39.436 --> 53:41.021
I'm at risk here, too.

53:41.438 --> 53:43.231
I don't give a shit about you.

53:45.484 --> 53:46.735
Bring her in.

53:52.073 --> 53:52.908
Hoffman.

53:55.994 --> 53:58.538
Get some blankets,
some tea, some warm broth.

54:00.332 --> 54:00.916
Here.

54:01.166 --> 54:02.584
Well put it over her.

54:03.752 --> 54:04.794
Not there.

54:39.120 --> 54:40.831
How many of those
will you give her?

54:41.832 --> 54:43.458
She's had twenty minutes of gas.

55:24.624 --> 55:25.625
Put it there.

55:26.334 --> 55:27.460
It's alright.

55:38.013 --> 55:38.972
Some tea.

55:53.236 --> 55:54.988
Stop that! Let me do it.

55:59.784 --> 56:00.744
Spoon.

56:04.247 --> 56:05.665
This is just some tea.

56:06.708 --> 56:07.542
Tea.

56:16.718 --> 56:18.261
Good. Good.

56:21.389 --> 56:23.892
- What was this convoy?
- Hungarian.

56:24.935 --> 56:26.478
- Who found her?
- He did.

56:26.645 --> 56:27.312
Where?

56:28.271 --> 56:29.314
On the bottom.

56:29.523 --> 56:31.274
The young are always
on the bottom.

56:32.442 --> 56:33.735
How was she lying?

56:34.236 --> 56:35.153
Lying?

56:35.987 --> 56:38.198
It's a simple question.
On her side, what?

56:39.032 --> 56:40.283
On her belly.

56:44.830 --> 56:46.081
Can you hear me?

56:48.041 --> 56:48.917
Hello?

56:51.628 --> 56:52.963
You must speak with me.

56:54.965 --> 56:56.007
Hello.

56:59.261 --> 57:00.887
What's your name?

57:03.431 --> 57:04.474
Hello.

57:05.350 --> 57:06.309
Hello.

57:10.188 --> 57:11.773
This is gonna take time.

57:13.316 --> 57:14.484
It'll take time.

57:16.987 --> 57:19.781
So simple...

57:21.700 --> 57:23.952
...and whom does it harm?

57:28.248 --> 57:29.457
It harms only you.

57:30.625 --> 57:33.920
If you refuse to tell us
what we're going to know anyway...

57:34.462 --> 57:37.215
which is where was
the powder going?

57:42.220 --> 57:43.972
Where was the powder going?

57:47.517 --> 57:51.062
Is this what you want happening
to the people who have the powder...

57:51.897 --> 57:54.524
...or to the rest of your block
until we find them?

57:58.487 --> 58:02.532
Where was the powder going?

58:03.158 --> 58:04.284
Don't tell them.

58:04.826 --> 58:06.703
Don't tell them. Don't tell them.

58:08.246 --> 58:10.665
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

58:11.500 --> 58:14.002
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

58:15.253 --> 58:17.047
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

58:26.932 --> 58:28.391
You're not supposed
to be in the zones.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.643
I'm aware of that.

58:30.268 --> 58:33.396
There were two girls caught with
explosives in the Polish section.

58:34.648 --> 58:36.983
You think we're suddenly chummy
with the rest of the camp?

58:39.653 --> 58:41.613
You have another piece
for the way back?

58:41.947 --> 58:43.198
I'll get it there.

58:45.492 --> 58:47.369
You're not supposed
to be in the zones.

58:47.577 --> 58:48.620
You said that.

58:52.707 --> 58:53.834
Give me the other piece.

58:58.088 --> 58:59.965
And have two for the way back.

59:00.090 --> 59:02.509
Or you won't be slapped,
you'll be shot.

59:07.055 --> 59:09.057
No one's gonna harm you here.

59:09.474 --> 59:10.642
We're Jews.

59:11.560 --> 59:12.727
Are you Hungarian?

59:13.019 --> 59:14.271
Yes, she's Hungarian.

59:14.479 --> 59:16.231
The point is simple questions.

59:16.565 --> 59:18.024
Give us some more
of that soup.

59:26.366 --> 59:27.868
We're going to be found here.

59:28.243 --> 59:29.286
He's right.

59:30.120 --> 59:31.580
We're not moving her.

59:31.872 --> 59:35.125
It's been over 2 hours since we started
the lifts. Someone will come right past.

59:35.333 --> 59:37.836
And do we cart her down the hall
without getting through the unit?

59:38.044 --> 59:39.504
The unit doesn't know?

59:39.713 --> 59:40.755
What would that do?

59:41.381 --> 59:43.049
At least get her
off the corridor.

59:44.426 --> 59:45.844
Fine. The changing room.

59:45.969 --> 59:47.012
The changing room?

59:47.262 --> 59:49.347
I said.
Go see if it's clear.

59:51.725 --> 59:55.687
We're gonna move you. Into another
room, you'll be more comfortable.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.150
She's alive, you know.

01:00:10.619 --> 01:00:12.162
Where can you keep her?

01:00:12.704 --> 01:00:13.580
We can't.

01:00:14.039 --> 01:00:15.290
This is a problem.

01:00:15.582 --> 01:00:16.500
Yeah, it's problem.

01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:19.252
Because we've revived her.
You understand that.

01:00:19.544 --> 01:00:21.129
This wasn't my idea.

01:00:21.213 --> 01:00:22.380
But she's been revived.

01:00:22.547 --> 01:00:24.257
We have a responsibility.

01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:25.300
Otherwise...

01:00:25.383 --> 01:00:25.967
Otherwise?

01:00:26.218 --> 01:00:27.761
Why did we revive her?

01:00:28.011 --> 01:00:30.096
- If you tell Mussfeld.
- No.

01:00:30.388 --> 01:00:32.265
- If you speak with him.
- Me?

01:00:32.974 --> 01:00:34.059
The two of you.

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.228
What? Are friends?

01:00:37.062 --> 01:00:38.939
None of us is going
to talk with Mussfeld.

01:00:40.816 --> 01:00:42.692
He will not allow this girl
to live.

01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:44.986
He doesn't save people.

01:00:45.529 --> 01:00:46.655
Your family?

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.451
Who told you?

01:00:51.535 --> 01:00:52.702
We heard.

01:00:53.328 --> 01:00:54.996
You got the run of C-camp...

01:00:55.622 --> 01:00:57.624
...and found your wife and kid.

01:00:57.833 --> 01:00:59.376
You wouldn't do the same?

01:00:59.584 --> 01:01:01.670
- And got them out.
- You wouldn't do the same?

01:01:01.878 --> 01:01:04.381
- I wouldn't have the chance.
- That's not what I asked you.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.094
I didn't have the chance.

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:16.893
If we tell Mussfeld,
she's finished.

01:01:17.394 --> 01:01:18.436
You hide her.

01:01:18.645 --> 01:01:19.688
One of the doctors.

01:01:19.813 --> 01:01:20.647
Impossible.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.440
They walk in at all hours.
It has to be...

01:01:22.607 --> 01:01:24.192
No. I said no.

01:01:24.317 --> 01:01:25.360
For a few days.

01:01:25.527 --> 01:01:26.695
What few days?

01:01:26.903 --> 01:01:28.488
We're almost sixteen weeks.

01:01:28.655 --> 01:01:31.158
Plus with men who've been
who've hardly seen a...

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.243
...and she's what, fifteen?

01:01:33.368 --> 01:01:34.828
Put her in your bed.

01:01:34.911 --> 01:01:37.247
She's not staying with us,
alright? I want her out.

01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:39.082
Forgetting for a minute
she's a girl...

01:01:39.332 --> 01:01:42.127
what do you gain by putting her
with us when we're about to be...

01:01:42.669 --> 01:01:43.879
Until what?

01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:45.463
A suitable time.

01:01:45.672 --> 01:01:47.215
There isn't going
to be a suitable time.

01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:48.800
A day or two.

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:51.094
We don't have a day or two.

01:01:51.303 --> 01:01:52.345
Nonsense.

01:01:56.850 --> 01:01:57.726
What?

01:02:00.604 --> 01:02:02.355
There's going to be an uprising.

01:02:04.316 --> 01:02:05.192
When?

01:02:07.903 --> 01:02:09.029
Alright, who?

01:02:09.321 --> 01:02:10.780
Numbers 1 and 3.

01:02:11.239 --> 01:02:12.073
How?

01:02:12.657 --> 01:02:14.242
Out of Number 3.

01:02:14.367 --> 01:02:15.202
An escape?

01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:17.662
We're going to destroy
the crematorium.

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:19.873
You'll all be killed.

01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:23.418
The things that come out
of your mouth.

01:02:23.919 --> 01:02:25.629
We're to be killed
within the week.

01:02:25.712 --> 01:02:26.963
How do you know?

01:02:27.297 --> 01:02:29.674
Like I said, we're almost
four months.

01:02:29.883 --> 01:02:32.802
We're dead.
Our time's up.

01:02:34.888 --> 01:02:36.973
Were you going to ask
for our help?

01:02:37.808 --> 01:02:39.142
Ask for your help?

01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.976
The doctors.

01:02:40.727 --> 01:02:42.813
Were you going to ask
for our help?

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:44.606
Even tell us?

01:02:47.943 --> 01:02:50.195
I never asked to be doing
what I do.

01:02:50.403 --> 01:02:52.280
You volunteered.

01:02:52.572 --> 01:02:55.116
They wanted doctors
for a hospital.

01:02:55.325 --> 01:02:58.703
You knew the sort of work you'd be
doing, and you continue to do it.

01:02:59.204 --> 01:03:00.330
I don't kill.

01:03:00.539 --> 01:03:01.706
And we do?

01:03:02.415 --> 01:03:03.792
I didn't say that.

01:03:05.335 --> 01:03:06.920
You give killing purpose.

01:03:07.128 --> 01:03:09.923
We're all just trying
to make it to the next day.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.217
That's all any
of us is doing.

01:03:12.717 --> 01:03:14.594
You have no idea, do you?

01:03:14.928 --> 01:03:16.513
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.933
I do not wish to be alive
when all of this is over.

01:03:20.267 --> 01:03:21.685
I don't believe that.

01:03:22.853 --> 01:03:24.229
I know you don't.

01:03:24.813 --> 01:03:26.523
I can help you.

01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:28.275
You want to
help?

01:03:29.234 --> 01:03:31.194
Get rid of this fucking girl.

01:04:00.307 --> 01:04:01.516
Where have you been?

01:04:01.766 --> 01:04:02.476
What do we got?

01:04:02.684 --> 01:04:04.269
Plenty, but very little gold.

01:04:04.436 --> 01:04:05.479
You're gonna have to divvy up.

01:04:05.687 --> 01:04:06.730
They've got three of the women.

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.689
Where?

01:04:07.939 --> 01:04:10.317
Block eleven. Someone says we're
hiding a girl still alive?

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.860
Keep everyone away
from this area.

01:04:12.068 --> 01:04:13.445
- Is it true?
- We'll be up.

01:04:14.279 --> 01:04:16.865
We heard. We got problems
of our own.

01:04:17.073 --> 01:04:18.742
- What's he doing?
- I told him.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:19.659
You told him?

01:04:19.868 --> 01:04:21.453
I just told him. Come on.

01:04:35.967 --> 01:04:37.928
- Why are you here?
- What's this about?

01:04:38.136 --> 01:04:39.596
She survived the gas.

01:04:40.514 --> 01:04:42.098
What're you gonna do with her?

01:04:43.558 --> 01:04:44.684
What're you gonna do with her?

01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:46.144
Why is he here?

01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:48.897
They caught three of the women
for the Unio, found powder.

01:04:49.105 --> 01:04:49.940
Here?

01:04:50.315 --> 01:04:51.733
In the camp.

01:04:51.858 --> 01:04:52.859
How do you know?

01:04:53.068 --> 01:04:55.529
They didn't come with the powder
and we found out. As far as we know...

01:04:57.322 --> 01:05:00.367
They've been stealing and they aren't
going to find out where it was going?

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:01.576
I didn't say that.

01:05:01.785 --> 01:05:04.204
- They are being tortured right now?
- Of course they are.

01:05:04.412 --> 01:05:08.792
How long did you expect this
to go on, before they were caught?

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:10.377
- We couldn't have...
- We couldn't have what?

01:05:10.877 --> 01:05:15.090
We couldn't mustered together at any
time once we decided it was time...

01:05:15.257 --> 01:05:16.925
- No, we couldn't...
- Oh, God dam, no we couldn't have.

01:05:17.175 --> 01:05:18.301
That's a lie.

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:19.010
It was...

01:05:19.261 --> 01:05:22.222
- It was who? The Poles?
- No, it was the whole group.

01:05:22.347 --> 01:05:26.309
So we waited for this to be killed
without the chance.

01:05:26.518 --> 01:05:27.978
There are two women
being tortured right now.

01:05:28.186 --> 01:05:29.104
Why are they being tortured?

01:05:29.354 --> 01:05:31.106
Why are we still burning day
after day?

01:05:31.314 --> 01:05:34.568
Because we've waited. Because
suddenly this became about escape.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.194
And let's get it straight,
Hesh.

01:05:37.154 --> 01:05:40.490
You were gonna deal us out.
We were just a fucking diversion.

01:05:40.699 --> 01:05:42.242
How many times does this
have to be gone over?

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:46.621
Every gun you guys have got you've
kept and we find out about it later.

01:05:46.872 --> 01:05:48.415
Not shit from you guys.

01:05:48.623 --> 01:05:50.876
Only plans and delays.
Your plans.

01:05:51.126 --> 01:05:52.169
We changed our plans.

01:05:52.377 --> 01:05:55.380
Changed your plans, but only
after we decided we'd be out.

01:05:55.714 --> 01:05:57.591
Had to make a deal,
re-coordinate.

01:05:58.008 --> 01:06:01.553
But were you gonna stay wait
until two crematoria were done...

01:06:01.761 --> 01:06:03.221
...or let us do that and run run...

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.599
...like you always wanted to,
while we stayed and fought?

01:06:05.807 --> 01:06:06.558
I don't know.

01:06:06.766 --> 01:06:09.769
But when we're through
with the machinery, I can't run?

01:06:09.978 --> 01:06:13.440
I have to stay here and be shot
because that's what you want to do?

01:06:13.648 --> 01:06:15.275
Because you can't live
with it, I can't?

01:06:15.442 --> 01:06:16.485
Fuck you, Max.

01:06:16.568 --> 01:06:19.404
It's my fucking life.
I hope I live till I'm ninety.

01:06:21.156 --> 01:06:22.407
Now we're ready to go today.

01:06:22.616 --> 01:06:23.450
- What?
- Today?

01:06:23.658 --> 01:06:24.826
Between the shifts.

01:06:24.993 --> 01:06:26.995
Why else am I here?
To argue with this idiot?

01:06:27.204 --> 01:06:29.456
- Who starts the fire?
- Us.

01:06:29.998 --> 01:06:32.584
You see how easy it is once
the decision is made.

01:06:33.043 --> 01:06:34.085
We have to tell the unit.

01:06:34.294 --> 01:06:37.714
An hour. Everyone knows
what to do. It's a matter of when.

01:06:38.256 --> 01:06:39.382
What about the girl?

01:06:39.633 --> 01:06:40.884
What about her?

01:06:41.092 --> 01:06:42.135
What do we do with her?

01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:43.345
What do we do with her?

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:46.181
- It's got to be now, Max.
- We get her in the fence.

01:06:46.807 --> 01:06:47.516
Out?

01:06:47.724 --> 01:06:49.726
- The fence into the camp.
- You'll never.

01:06:49.935 --> 01:06:51.812
- In a group we could.
- A group is worse.

01:06:51.895 --> 01:06:53.271
- It doesn't have to be.
- We're locked in.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.314
Don't do this.

01:06:54.523 --> 01:06:55.565
An excuse could be found.

01:06:55.774 --> 01:06:56.483
The Doctor's right.

01:06:56.691 --> 01:06:59.236
We shave her head, dress her
she looks like a boy.

01:06:59.444 --> 01:07:00.570
What happens on the other side
of the fence?

01:07:00.779 --> 01:07:01.696
She gets taken in.

01:07:01.905 --> 01:07:02.948
- Which camp?
- Does it matter?

01:07:03.198 --> 01:07:05.075
Yes, it matters.
What do they do with her?

01:07:05.283 --> 01:07:06.618
How do they account
for the extra?...

01:07:06.827 --> 01:07:10.288
This is Germans we're talking about.
They stand corpses up in the snow...

01:07:10.372 --> 01:07:12.582
They're going to suspect
someone of breaking in?

01:07:12.749 --> 01:07:13.708
Breaking in from here.

01:07:13.917 --> 01:07:15.043
She's not even numbered.

01:07:15.252 --> 01:07:18.713
Don't fuck this up for one life!
You'll be shot and so will she.

01:07:19.005 --> 01:07:20.590
Then there's alert
and today's impossible.

01:07:20.799 --> 01:07:21.758
He's right, Max.

01:07:21.925 --> 01:07:24.469
It'll drag us down.
No single person is worth that.

01:07:26.304 --> 01:07:27.514
Look at her.

01:07:28.557 --> 01:07:30.392
Does she even have a mind left?
Can she speak?

01:07:31.017 --> 01:07:31.977
We don't know.

01:07:33.186 --> 01:07:34.146
Can you speak?

01:07:38.733 --> 01:07:39.568
The gas got to her.

01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:41.319
Why are you even considering?

01:07:41.528 --> 01:07:42.737
- We don't kill people.
- We don't?

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.866
We put them in the rooms,
walk them in and strip...

01:07:46.032 --> 01:07:47.409
...them look them in the face
and say it's safe.

01:07:47.576 --> 01:07:48.535
What the hell is that?

01:07:48.743 --> 01:07:49.286
- It's not...
- It's not what?

01:07:49.452 --> 01:07:50.704
It's not pulling the trigger.

01:07:50.954 --> 01:07:52.414
You leave the room.

01:07:52.581 --> 01:07:56.168
Bring them in and leave say it's safe,
you'll see them when it's over.

01:07:56.251 --> 01:07:59.588
Who put her inside? Now you
think she made it through.

01:07:59.796 --> 01:08:01.214
God knows how you're a hero.

01:08:01.464 --> 01:08:02.257
Not a hero.

01:08:02.507 --> 01:08:04.259
Not a hero, not a killer.
What are you, Max?

01:08:04.885 --> 01:08:07.429
Better we do it than them.
I'll make it easy for you.

01:08:07.637 --> 01:08:09.055
We can solve this another way.

01:08:09.306 --> 01:08:10.098
I'll fucking kill you!

01:08:10.265 --> 01:08:11.141
You won't do shit.

01:08:11.308 --> 01:08:13.477
We're not going to kill her,
alright?

01:08:13.852 --> 01:08:16.688
I'm not saying we shouldn't have,
but we're not gonna do it now.

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:44.883
On the bench here.

01:08:45.926 --> 01:08:46.801
What about me?

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:48.011
What about you?

01:08:48.053 --> 01:08:49.638
If he sees me we're fucked
if he sees me.

01:08:49.845 --> 01:08:52.265
There's hundreds of He's not
gonna know you. Just keep still.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.809
He wanders around half drunk.

01:08:54.643 --> 01:08:55.894
It's a fucking check.

01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:05.069
Why is this door shut?

01:09:05.694 --> 01:09:07.697
We were organizing
the morning muster.

01:09:07.988 --> 01:09:09.115
Organizing?

01:09:09.282 --> 01:09:10.617
With Lowenthal... Gone.

01:09:10.826 --> 01:09:12.035
We settled that.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.578
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer,
but now with one short...

01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:16.540
Who's going to replace him?

01:09:17.165 --> 01:09:17.999
He is.

01:09:20.377 --> 01:09:21.962
He's not capable.

01:09:23.755 --> 01:09:24.881
You!

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.216
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

01:09:26.424 --> 01:09:28.676
And who replaces him
is your business.

01:09:28.801 --> 01:09:30.095
That's just the thing.

01:09:30.761 --> 01:09:33.223
- What happens with...
- The duties in the room stay the same.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.265
Yes, sir.

01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:40.229
It's miserable outside.

01:09:45.318 --> 01:09:47.529
I've grown to hate Poland.

01:09:56.037 --> 01:09:57.539
How are you, Doctor?

01:09:57.831 --> 01:09:58.665
I'm well.

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:03.253
Do you want to come over
for a drink?

01:10:03.795 --> 01:10:06.882
I have some Hungarian wine
some brandy.

01:10:08.049 --> 01:10:08.967
Later.

01:10:09.384 --> 01:10:11.553
- If you've got a chill...
- I said no.

01:10:13.889 --> 01:10:15.474
There's a convoy arriving...

01:10:16.183 --> 01:10:19.186
...and your group haven't finished
with the cargo from this morning.

01:10:19.311 --> 01:10:22.147
- We just have to...
- You have to clear the elevators.

01:10:22.439 --> 01:10:23.356
Yes, sir.

01:10:24.107 --> 01:10:25.901
And it's filthy down there.

01:11:11.446 --> 01:11:12.364
Yes?

01:11:14.366 --> 01:11:15.116
What?

01:11:15.826 --> 01:11:17.285
Why are you here?

01:11:18.203 --> 01:11:19.079
Here?

01:11:20.497 --> 01:11:23.834
This isn't your unit.
This isn't your building.

01:11:25.001 --> 01:11:25.919
To help.

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:27.879
How did you get over?

01:11:28.255 --> 01:11:29.297
I was moved.

01:11:29.798 --> 01:11:31.550
- By whom?
- Almaier.

01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:34.469
That's not true, is it?

01:11:35.345 --> 01:11:36.680
Of course it's true.

01:11:53.864 --> 01:11:56.491
That's how it'll go
for all of us.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.245
First you, then us.

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.749
The last thing to do
is smile.

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:09.504
Your bombers only speed it all up.

01:12:11.006 --> 01:12:15.260
We'll dispose of as many of you
as we can before they do it to us.

01:12:17.554 --> 01:12:19.222
Why was he here?

01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:20.265
He was moved.

01:12:20.474 --> 01:12:21.766
He was not moved!

01:12:21.892 --> 01:12:23.602
You were to stay
with your groups.

01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:28.106
Why were the women
from the Unio hoarding powder?

01:12:30.192 --> 01:12:33.695
Why were the women
from the Unio hoarding powder?

01:12:37.365 --> 01:12:38.533
We let you live.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.410
You're not gonna let us live.

01:12:40.785 --> 01:12:43.830
If something is attempted,
that's certain.

01:12:44.122 --> 01:12:46.833
If you think we have powder,
tear apart the crematorium.

01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:51.213
Move away from the bench.

01:13:00.597 --> 01:13:01.973
Where did she come from?

01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:06.228
Doctor?

01:13:07.687 --> 01:13:08.730
Everybody out.

01:13:09.147 --> 01:13:10.649
You give orders now?

01:13:10.857 --> 01:13:12.818
It won't help anyone
if there's a row.

01:13:13.318 --> 01:13:15.320
How will the work get finished?

01:13:15.946 --> 01:13:18.782
Everyone out.
I'll take care of this.

01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:20.325
What do you mean,
take care of this?

01:13:20.534 --> 01:13:21.576
I want what you want.

01:13:21.827 --> 01:13:22.953
Don't speak Hungarian!

01:13:25.038 --> 01:13:26.581
What are you saying?

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.542
Leave quietly. Leave.

01:13:30.752 --> 01:13:31.670
Let's go.

01:13:31.878 --> 01:13:33.880
Save her. You've got
to fucking save her.

01:13:34.172 --> 01:13:37.926
Shut him up. Take this with you.
And burn it with the others.

01:13:49.187 --> 01:13:53.275
I've seen them strike the ones
that are slow getting in.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.528
Hey steal, lie to each other.

01:13:58.905 --> 01:14:01.116
I never fully despised
the Jews...

01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:05.787
...until I experienced how easily they
could be persuaded to do the work.

01:14:06.663 --> 01:14:08.290
To do it so well.

01:14:08.832 --> 01:14:10.667
And to their own people.

01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:13.587
They'll be dead
by week's end eve soul...

01:14:14.129 --> 01:14:17.382
...and we'll replace them
with others' no different.

01:14:18.717 --> 01:14:20.969
Do you know how easy that'll be?

01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:31.062
Who are you?

01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:34.483
She doesn't speak German.
I don't even think she speaks.

01:14:35.525 --> 01:14:38.445
- You don't understand me?
- She's from a convoy.

01:14:39.362 --> 01:14:42.073
I didn't imagine she's
from Osweicum.

01:14:42.908 --> 01:14:44.993
- This morning's convoy?
- Of course.

01:14:46.369 --> 01:14:47.621
So you're Hungarian.

01:14:55.504 --> 01:14:57.839
They took her out
from the undressing room?

01:14:58.757 --> 01:14:59.674
Why her?

01:15:00.425 --> 01:15:02.010
She's related to someone?

01:15:02.302 --> 01:15:03.345
She survived.

01:15:04.179 --> 01:15:05.305
Survived what?

01:15:05.972 --> 01:15:07.015
The gas.

01:15:10.143 --> 01:15:11.978
All I can think is that,
with the wet floor...

01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:13.438
It kills everyone.

01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:19.611
If there was a pocket of wet air...
Should we speak in private?

01:15:21.696 --> 01:15:24.616
If she doesn't speak German,
what's the problem?

01:15:25.075 --> 01:15:28.078
I find it difficult to stand here
and discuss while...

01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:29.830
What's to discuss?

01:15:37.754 --> 01:15:40.131
I have the information
you requested.

01:15:40.882 --> 01:15:42.133
The information?

01:15:42.342 --> 01:15:44.010
At the time you saved my wife
and child.

01:15:44.219 --> 01:15:45.345
Tell me here.

01:15:45.887 --> 01:15:48.390
I don't want to tell you here.

01:15:53.937 --> 01:15:54.855
You.

01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:57.732
Stay here with her.

01:16:00.861 --> 01:16:04.239
If you take her out from here,
both of you will be killed.

01:16:06.324 --> 01:16:07.826
Stay here.

01:16:48.783 --> 01:16:50.869
I used to think so much
of myself.

01:16:53.038 --> 01:16:54.831
What I've made of my life.

01:16:59.586 --> 01:17:02.714
We can't know what
we're capable of, any of us.

01:17:04.799 --> 01:17:09.304
How can you know what you'd do to
stay alive until you're really asked?

01:17:11.807 --> 01:17:13.016
I know this now.

01:17:14.518 --> 01:17:16.061
For most of us...

01:17:17.729 --> 01:17:20.565
...the answer is anything.

01:17:24.194 --> 01:17:26.738
It's so easy to forget
who we were before.

01:17:30.158 --> 01:17:32.118
Who we'll never be again.

01:17:34.204 --> 01:17:35.580
There was this old man.

01:17:36.832 --> 01:17:38.625
He pushed the carts.

01:17:39.543 --> 01:17:41.545
And on our first day...

01:17:42.128 --> 01:17:45.257
when we had to burn
our own convoy...

01:17:45.924 --> 01:17:48.718
...his wife was brought up
on the elevator.

01:17:49.761 --> 01:17:51.221
Then his daughter.

01:17:52.681 --> 01:17:54.349
And then both his grandchildren.

01:17:57.686 --> 01:17:58.895
I knew him.

01:17:59.563 --> 01:18:00.897
We were neighbours.

01:18:03.316 --> 01:18:05.068
And in twenty minutes...

01:18:05.485 --> 01:18:10.615
...his whole family and all its future
was gone from this earth.

01:18:13.827 --> 01:18:17.706
Two weeks later he took pills
and was revived.

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:22.294
We smothered him
with his own pillow.

01:18:22.919 --> 01:18:25.088
And now I know why.

01:18:25.338 --> 01:18:29.509
You can kill yourself.
That's the only choice.

01:18:34.264 --> 01:18:36.057
I want them to save you.

01:18:37.392 --> 01:18:40.020
I want them to save you more
than I want anything.

01:18:42.022 --> 01:18:43.982
I pray to God we save you.

01:18:45.442 --> 01:18:47.235
You can hear me, can't you?

01:18:53.575 --> 01:18:54.618
I thought so.

01:18:59.831 --> 01:19:01.791
Yes. I thought so.

01:19:04.044 --> 01:19:06.087
I don't understand, Doctor.

01:19:06.421 --> 01:19:08.673
I don't know
how I can make it clearer.

01:19:09.716 --> 01:19:13.220
Dr. Mengele says you're
the best surgeon he's seen ever.

01:19:13.804 --> 01:19:15.472
I Jew, even, and he admits it.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.224
Which is astonishing.

01:19:17.557 --> 01:19:19.851
He says you do the work
of five men.

01:19:20.268 --> 01:19:22.354
That without you his research
would be impossible.

01:19:22.562 --> 01:19:23.814
Where is this leading?

01:19:24.022 --> 01:19:26.316
Your expertise
has quintupled the torture.

01:19:26.483 --> 01:19:27.234
I haven't...

01:19:27.359 --> 01:19:29.861
Has quintupled the torture
of children in this camp...

01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:31.321
...and that is fact!

01:19:31.488 --> 01:19:35.534
So that you can live here as you do,
which is better than any other Jew.

01:19:35.659 --> 01:19:38.119
And better than all
but a handful of Germans.

01:19:38.286 --> 01:19:39.538
Including me.

01:19:40.288 --> 01:19:42.457
I haven't seen you once protest...

01:19:42.916 --> 01:19:45.377
...and as the workload has increased.

01:19:45.585 --> 01:19:47.379
And you've saved your family.

01:19:47.587 --> 01:19:49.172
We do what we do.

01:19:49.798 --> 01:19:52.175
You make up for that
with the life of this one girl?

01:19:52.384 --> 01:19:53.635
I don't pretend.

01:19:53.969 --> 01:19:54.761
Good.

01:19:55.303 --> 01:19:56.263
Don't.

01:19:56.763 --> 01:19:58.640
And who is to die in her place?

01:19:59.266 --> 01:20:01.017
No one lives here
without someone else dying.

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:01.977
I don't believe that.

01:20:02.185 --> 01:20:03.019
It's a fact of the camp.

01:20:03.228 --> 01:20:04.396
It's numbers.

01:20:04.604 --> 01:20:06.231
There's only so much food,
so much room.

01:20:06.481 --> 01:20:07.691
This is one child.

01:20:08.024 --> 01:20:09.484
Which you could say about anyone.

01:20:09.693 --> 01:20:11.236
Your wife and daughter.

01:20:11.778 --> 01:20:13.947
You save one, you take the life
of another.

01:20:14.281 --> 01:20:17.200
Put her in a bed, give her food
someone else doesn't get...

01:20:17.826 --> 01:20:19.327
...dies or is removed.

01:20:20.662 --> 01:20:22.747
To save her
is a meaningless lie.

01:20:23.039 --> 01:20:25.125
It's your lie,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:27.460
We want the girl to live.

01:20:30.881 --> 01:20:33.592
If you tell me this information,
I will spare the girl.

01:20:35.969 --> 01:20:37.429
There's going to be an uprising.

01:20:37.512 --> 01:20:38.555
When?

01:20:38.805 --> 01:20:41.183
I don't know. They don't want me
to be a part of it.

01:20:41.391 --> 01:20:43.351
And they have powder.
The women got them powder?

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.188
- I said I don't know.
- Why did they tell you?

01:20:46.313 --> 01:20:48.190
Because of the girl.
Because they wouldn't hide her.

01:20:48.273 --> 01:20:50.567
- Who told you?
- The one you killed.

01:20:50.859 --> 01:20:51.985
How did you speak with him?

01:20:52.235 --> 01:20:54.321
He was here, wasn't he?
That's why you shot him.

01:20:54.529 --> 01:20:56.156
No one else here speaks with me.

01:20:56.531 --> 01:21:00.118
- But they have powder?
- I don't know.

01:21:00.494 --> 01:21:02.454
- Weapons?
- I don't...

01:21:02.746 --> 01:21:05.040
But powder from the women.
That's where the powder went.

01:21:05.207 --> 01:21:06.625
I've heard nothing else.

01:21:07.042 --> 01:21:10.795
- This information is useless to me.
- It's all I was told.

01:21:11.004 --> 01:21:13.089
It's not worth the life
of the girl.

01:21:14.674 --> 01:21:15.884
You agreed.

01:21:16.635 --> 01:21:20.806
Wrong, Doctor. I agreed to save your
wife and daughter, which I have done.

01:21:23.099 --> 01:21:24.434
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer...

01:21:24.559 --> 01:21:26.436
There's nothing more to discuss.

01:21:28.939 --> 01:21:31.858
What about your headaches
and your drinking?

01:21:36.154 --> 01:21:37.197
Excuse me?

01:21:38.532 --> 01:21:40.200
I'll tell him you're unfit.

01:21:45.205 --> 01:21:47.207
And they won't move you
somewhere else.

01:21:48.458 --> 01:21:50.085
I'll want to see her.

01:21:50.836 --> 01:21:53.463
Not a hair on her head,
and on the other side.

01:21:55.048 --> 01:21:57.134
Through the fence,
if you'd like...

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.678
...but numbered, shaved and alive.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.808
And to live isn't to kill,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

01:22:06.977 --> 01:22:08.770
Because we are not doing
the killing.

01:22:10.021 --> 01:22:12.107
No. Please, no!

01:22:14.609 --> 01:22:17.946
Because she knew.
Because all of you know.

01:22:20.031 --> 01:22:22.200
And these two know.

01:22:24.703 --> 01:22:28.373
I could say I don't want to be doing
this but that wouldn't be true.

01:22:31.293 --> 01:22:33.670
It's less bodies for us
to worry about.

01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:35.672
Keep track of.

01:22:36.089 --> 01:22:36.923
Feed.

01:22:38.467 --> 01:22:41.219
So, do us a favour
and remain silent.

01:22:43.597 --> 01:22:46.099
But you don't seem
to be enjoying it...

01:22:47.058 --> 01:22:49.644
...murdering your friends
to protect...

01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:51.313
who?

01:22:51.813 --> 01:22:54.566
Polish partisans who hate you?

01:22:54.858 --> 01:22:56.318
Sold Jews...

01:22:56.943 --> 01:22:59.112
...and stole from Jews early
in the war.

01:23:08.413 --> 01:23:09.539
One by one...

01:23:09.664 --> 01:23:11.875
We can do this until we're done
with your whole group...

01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:14.628
...and then we'll move
to the next block.

01:23:16.129 --> 01:23:17.672
Or one of you any of you...

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.512
...tell us where the powder is,
where it was headed.

01:23:24.054 --> 01:23:26.223
They don't know.
None of them know.

01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:28.850
Tell them, please.
Tell them.

01:23:29.184 --> 01:23:30.936
They don't know.
Don't you think they would say?

01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:33.146
You know, and you're silent.

01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:34.272
Stop the killing.

01:23:35.398 --> 01:23:38.026
You know, because you had
to have been approached.

01:23:40.237 --> 01:23:42.197
And you are getting it
for somewhere.

01:23:43.865 --> 01:23:45.075
Stop the killing.

01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:50.330
Please. Please.

01:23:50.956 --> 01:23:52.082
No! No!

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:54.793
Don't shoot her!

01:24:18.066 --> 01:24:19.526
Get a proper count.

01:24:41.423 --> 01:24:43.300
It's all sentimental.

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:47.471
Do you understand sentimental?

01:24:49.848 --> 01:24:52.142
Because they look you
in the eye twice.

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:55.061
Once before and once after.

01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:58.356
Suddenly they believe
in heroics.

01:25:02.068 --> 01:25:03.403
You wait here.

01:25:07.699 --> 01:25:09.993
Hold her in here
until I get back.

01:25:10.202 --> 01:25:11.536
Don't leave her.

01:25:19.377 --> 01:25:20.295
They're saving her.

01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:22.088
No, Max, the Doctor
will make certain.

01:25:22.214 --> 01:25:23.799
You saw, or they told you?

01:25:23.924 --> 01:25:25.133
The Doctor told me.

01:25:25.217 --> 01:25:26.176
We did this.

01:25:26.384 --> 01:25:27.427
Listen to me, listen.

01:25:27.594 --> 01:25:30.722
What's going to happen to her will happen,
no matter what you do or see.

01:25:30.847 --> 01:25:32.599
You're right, we did it.
We saved her.

01:25:32.974 --> 01:25:36.770
The best thing you can do is to finish
the day quietly and wait for later.

01:25:37.521 --> 01:25:38.146
That's it.

01:25:38.563 --> 01:25:39.898
That's it for you.

01:25:40.148 --> 01:25:41.691
The goddam end.

01:25:42.734 --> 01:25:45.570
Hoffman, you have to get over to the
Third, tell them about Abramowics.

01:25:45.862 --> 01:25:47.113
How am I to get through?

01:25:47.322 --> 01:25:48.240
We'll load you up.

01:25:48.365 --> 01:25:49.199
Here.

01:25:50.242 --> 01:25:52.536
Exactly what happened.

01:25:52.953 --> 01:25:53.787
I don't speak Yiddish.

01:25:53.995 --> 01:25:55.789
Well, you can fucking convey
somebody getting shot.

01:25:56.164 --> 01:25:59.292
And don't try to come back.
We're not waiting for you.

01:25:59.584 --> 01:26:01.503
- I talked to her.
- Yes?

01:26:01.711 --> 01:26:03.171
I talked, she understood.

01:26:03.463 --> 01:26:04.589
What are you saying?

01:26:05.465 --> 01:26:07.884
- We were alone while...
- Did she talk?

01:26:08.385 --> 01:26:09.427
I said I talked.

01:26:09.678 --> 01:26:10.720
What did you say?

01:26:10.887 --> 01:26:12.973
- Everything.
- Everything?

01:26:14.141 --> 01:26:16.935
You told her?

01:26:17.269 --> 01:26:18.687
You would have, too.

01:26:18.937 --> 01:26:20.063
What do you know
what I would do.

01:26:20.272 --> 01:26:21.231
You would have.

01:26:21.314 --> 01:26:22.566
What does that do for her?

01:26:22.774 --> 01:26:23.608
Maybe it did something for me.

01:26:23.859 --> 01:26:26.111
Fuck what it did for you!

01:26:26.528 --> 01:26:27.654
What do you need?

01:26:27.863 --> 01:26:29.030
She'll know who we were.

01:26:29.239 --> 01:26:30.782
And why does she need
to know that?

01:26:31.449 --> 01:26:32.284
I don't know.

01:26:32.492 --> 01:26:34.035
That's right. You don't know.

01:26:34.244 --> 01:26:35.078
Do you?

01:26:35.287 --> 01:26:38.165
- Get going.
- Fuck off! I'm going.

01:26:40.917 --> 01:26:41.835
Do you?

01:26:44.963 --> 01:26:46.131
Fire! There's fire!

01:26:46.298 --> 01:26:47.716
He said between the shifts.

01:26:56.892 --> 01:26:59.686
Cohen, Lowy, we won't have time
to organize the groups.

01:26:59.811 --> 01:27:03.982
Get the guns and down into the
corridors and barricade the doors.

01:27:04.608 --> 01:27:05.525
Let's go!

01:27:06.234 --> 01:27:07.736
Let's go, let's go!

01:27:23.668 --> 01:27:25.003
Go see what's happening.

01:27:45.982 --> 01:27:47.442
Get the fuel drums.

01:28:25.605 --> 01:28:27.274
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer?

01:28:28.525 --> 01:28:30.694
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer
or any SS men with a young girl.

01:28:30.819 --> 01:28:31.444
No!

01:28:31.653 --> 01:28:34.197
Please, have you seen
a young girl? She was alive.

01:29:04.811 --> 01:29:06.354
We've only got two drums up there.

01:29:06.897 --> 01:29:08.148
We're nearly out of explosives.

01:29:08.356 --> 01:29:09.941
They're only the machine guns.

01:29:10.025 --> 01:29:12.736
I don't need to know.
Go tell Schlermer.

01:29:28.043 --> 01:29:30.128
We're dead up here.
Move down, move down!

01:30:48.874 --> 01:30:51.168
Kaminski needs bodies
in the furnace room.

01:30:51.376 --> 01:30:52.627
We're setting the explosives.

01:30:52.711 --> 01:30:54.796
Have you seen Mussfeld
with a girl?

01:30:55.046 --> 01:30:56.882
We need you in the furnace room.

01:30:58.842 --> 01:30:59.885
Come on!

01:31:00.635 --> 01:31:02.220
Get out! Get out!

01:31:23.909 --> 01:31:25.785
Get out! Get out!

01:31:28.705 --> 01:31:29.873
Get out!

01:31:32.584 --> 01:31:34.544
Surrender if you want to live.

01:31:34.753 --> 01:31:37.339
It's over.
We're gonna blow the room!

01:31:45.096 --> 01:31:46.640
Do it!

01:32:35.438 --> 01:32:37.023
Why don't they kill us.

01:32:38.984 --> 01:32:40.235
Did you ever see her?

01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:42.737
No. Did you?

01:32:44.406 --> 01:32:45.782
Why am I asking?

01:32:46.741 --> 01:32:48.368
Why aren't they killing us?

01:33:48.136 --> 01:33:50.722
The Russians will be here
before the year's out.

01:33:52.057 --> 01:33:56.019
If it weren't that, we would
never have pulled this off.

01:33:58.021 --> 01:33:59.147
You hid.

01:34:02.692 --> 01:34:03.944
Will I be killed?

01:34:05.278 --> 01:34:06.780
Do you want to be killed?

01:34:09.282 --> 01:34:10.826
You would have fought.

01:34:12.828 --> 01:34:14.079
Wouldn't you have?

01:34:20.544 --> 01:34:22.295
I've spoken with Dr. Mengele...

01:34:23.338 --> 01:34:27.008
...and assured him that you had
nothing to do with any of this.

01:34:28.802 --> 01:34:30.971
That you knew and did nothing.

01:34:34.808 --> 01:34:36.935
You will continue
with your work.

01:34:44.526 --> 01:34:45.777
That's right, Doctor.

01:34:47.904 --> 01:34:50.365
We will both continue
with our work.

01:34:51.616 --> 01:34:53.410
Because that's
what the living do.

01:34:55.871 --> 01:34:57.956
We will have saved each other,
then.

01:34:59.666 --> 01:35:01.626
We needn't save anyone else.

01:35:18.101 --> 01:35:19.769
In Budapest, mostly.

01:35:20.562 --> 01:35:21.980
My wife was from the city.

01:35:23.315 --> 01:35:25.192
But we stayed north.

01:35:26.735 --> 01:35:28.195
I still don't know why.

01:35:28.695 --> 01:35:29.988
It's beautiful there.

01:35:30.197 --> 01:35:31.156
Yes, it is.

01:35:32.491 --> 01:35:34.868
But we were finally gonna move
near her family.

01:35:35.827 --> 01:35:38.038
- Where did they live?
- Near the markets.

01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:41.374
We would be neighbours.

01:35:49.591 --> 01:35:50.842
Will they kill her?

01:35:51.092 --> 01:35:53.553
They're gonna show her this
then let her live.

01:35:54.596 --> 01:35:56.598
But why wouldn't
they have done it already.

01:35:58.016 --> 01:35:59.601
You're asking for reasons.

01:36:00.101 --> 01:36:01.353
I guess I was.

01:36:15.534 --> 01:36:17.035
We did something.

01:36:19.538 --> 01:36:20.330
Yes.

01:36:21.373 --> 01:36:22.541
We did.

01:36:26.086 --> 01:36:26.920
Yes. Bye.

01:36:32.634 --> 01:36:33.677
Neighbours.

01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:27.749
After there vo It,
half the ovens remain...

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.211
...and we are carried
to them together.

01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:39.261
I catch fire quickly.

01:38:45.058 --> 01:38:49.479
The first part of me rises
in dense smoke...

01:38:50.522 --> 01:38:53.650
...that mingles
with the smoke of others.

01:38:57.445 --> 01:38:59.447
Then, there are the bones...

01:39:00.282 --> 01:39:02.367
which settle in ash.

01:39:03.118 --> 01:39:07.581
And these are swept up
to be carried to the river.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.251
And last...

01:39:13.336 --> 01:39:17.090
...bits of our dust
simply float there...

01:39:17.507 --> 01:39:21.470
...in air, around the working
of the new group.

01:39:23.555 --> 01:39:26.475
These bits of dust are grey.

01:39:27.726 --> 01:39:31.271
We settle on their shoes
and on their faces...

01:39:32.105 --> 01:39:33.982
...and in their lungs.

01:39:35.442 --> 01:39:38.028
And they become so used to us...

01:39:38.778 --> 01:39:44.534
...that's on they don't cough
and they don't brush us away.

01:39:46.703 --> 01:39:49.831
At this point, they're just moving...

01:39:50.415 --> 01:39:52.751
...breathing and moving.

01:39:53.543 --> 01:39:57.005
Like any one else, still alive
in that place.

01:39:57.214 --> 01:40:03.470
And this is how
the work...

01:40:06.014 --> 01:40:07.557
...continues.
