00:09.777 --> 00:11.245
Another near beer, Dan?

00:11.279 --> 00:12.446
Thank you, barkeep.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.050
Put a big head on it so I
can pretend to enjoy it.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.852
Club soda, in a
glass, no lipstick.

00:21.755 --> 00:22.623
Hi Dan.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.125
Leon.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.426
Hey, Leon.

00:25.459 --> 00:29.330
You're a guy that
thinks sometimes.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.465
You think there's a
reason we're all here?

00:31.499 --> 00:34.635
Well, I'm here because
I ran out of gas.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.805
When the tow truck gets here,
I'll have my reason to leave.

00:37.838 --> 00:38.772
No, seriously.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.874
I'm talking big
picture stuff here.

00:40.908 --> 00:41.775
Ah, forget it.

00:41.809 --> 00:42.943
No, no, no, no, no.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.446
I'm just not used to
sharing my feelings

00:45.479 --> 00:46.814
in a place where
the rest rooms are

00:46.847 --> 00:50.384
labeled pointers and setters.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.087
Hmm, my opinion.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.588
Yes, I think there's a
reason we're all here.

00:54.622 --> 00:55.489
Really?

00:55.523 --> 00:56.524
Yeah, that's right.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.893
Cynical old Leon still
thinks that people

00:59.927 --> 01:03.997
here all serve a purpose on
this big spinning ball of dirt.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.233
Hey, I have to believe that.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.867
Otherwise it's just too hard
to get up in the morning

01:06.900 --> 01:09.637
and face the horrors
of the hetero world.

01:13.674 --> 01:18.279
Well, I guess that makes
some kind of weird sense.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.882
The hard part is figuring out
what we're put here to do.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.818
Oh, well I think you've
done your part, Dan.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.421
You married Roseanne.

01:27.455 --> 01:32.726
And saved some other
poor soul hell on Earth

01:32.760 --> 01:34.495
Well thanks, I guess.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.996
Coming to the poker game later?
- Oh, you betcha.

01:36.029 --> 01:36.864
[car honking]

01:36.897 --> 01:39.200
Oh, there's my Auto Club guy.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.401
In a tank top.

[theme music]

(SINGING) What doesn't kill
us is making us stronger.

01:50.578 --> 01:55.015
We're going to last longer than
the greatest wall in China,

01:55.048 --> 01:58.752
or that I rabbit with a drum.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.955
If there's one thing
that I learned,

02:01.989 --> 02:04.825
while waiting for my turn.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.995
It's that in each
life some rail falls,

02:08.028 --> 02:10.664
but you also get some sun.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.167
And we'll make better than OK.

02:13.201 --> 02:17.171
Hey, here what I say?

02:17.205 --> 02:20.608
Yeah, any day.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.617
[roseanne laughs]

02:33.687 --> 02:36.156
[music playing]

02:36.190 --> 02:38.626
Hey I've got it narrowed
down to The Golden

02:38.659 --> 02:41.795
Chamber, or The Elysian
Fields Health Spa.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.732
So you make the final decision.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.467
No, I'm not going
to pick, because then

02:46.500 --> 02:48.836
you'll be mad that I didn't
pick the one that I didn't pick.

02:48.869 --> 02:49.737
You pick.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.038
No, I'm not going to pick.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.005
I'm not a picker.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.312
You know, this wishy-washy
thing that you've got going,

02:58.346 --> 03:00.214
it's not working
for you anymore.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.114
You know what?

03:01.148 --> 03:02.583
You're right.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.717
You are absolutely right.

03:03.751 --> 03:04.618
That's done.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.919
That is-- I am--

03:05.953 --> 03:07.921
we're going to that one.

03:07.955 --> 03:08.756
End of story.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.831
See now I think this decisive
thing really works well on you.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.434
And you should have
done it a long time ago.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.102
Roseanne, you wouldn't let me.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.875
Well, all that is about to
change, Jackie, because I no

03:27.908 --> 03:30.311
longer have the
time or the energy

03:30.344 --> 03:33.113
to be living everybody
else's life for them.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.749
There is a me
underneath me, and she

03:35.783 --> 03:39.052
has been smothered by grease,
grit, and crap for way

03:39.086 --> 03:40.654
too long.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.857
Now this whole spa
experience is going to unlock

03:43.891 --> 03:46.660
my divine female essence.

03:46.694 --> 03:52.566
But unlocking essences,
they charge extra for that.

03:52.600 --> 03:58.071
I am going to get my poor
shrunk down to nothing Jackie.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.340
I'm going to get
pounded and beaten

03:59.373 --> 04:03.477
to a pulp by some hideous
old Korean masseuse.

04:03.511 --> 04:07.315
I'm going to get me chakras
opened, my Kundalini awakened.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.283
I'm going to do Japa on my mala.

04:09.317 --> 04:12.019
Then I'm going to find
my channels, meridians,

04:12.052 --> 04:15.323
and my G spots, and after that--

04:15.356 --> 04:18.058
look here, I'm getting one
of them colonic irrigations,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.160
because you can lose
about 60 pounds per time.

04:22.796 --> 04:28.336
Well, I am going I get
waxed, and wrapped, and buffed,

04:28.369 --> 04:31.339
and filed, and
soaked, and steamed,

04:31.372 --> 04:34.742
and purged, and peeled,
until there is not one

04:34.775 --> 04:36.644
original cell left in my body.

04:36.677 --> 04:41.782
And then, I am going to go
out and find a guy with pecs

04:41.815 --> 04:44.151
to knock on.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.553
And I'm going to start knocking.

04:50.057 --> 04:54.227
We're definitely
not sharing a room.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.195
Hey, Dan.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.964
We finally picked the spot.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.400
Now, are you going to
be OK at this place

04:59.433 --> 05:02.002
where you have to get
naked and covered in mud

05:02.035 --> 05:04.972
with about 400 other people?

05:05.005 --> 05:08.275
Yeah, sounds OK to me.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.377
Are you OK?

05:09.410 --> 05:10.210
Yeah, sure.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.588
You guys ever wondered
why we all exist?

05:20.621 --> 05:24.525
Well, I think, because we're
here to evolve into the people

05:24.558 --> 05:27.928
that we are destined
to turn into.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.630
Yeah, that's what the guy
at the gas station said.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.168
I'm just driving myself crazy.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.303
I guess I'll go
tinker in the garage.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.677
Going out to
tinker again, huh?

05:43.711 --> 05:44.678
What's that mean?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.648
Another macaroni ashtray.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.519
[music playing]

05:54.087 --> 05:55.222
Hey DJ, it's me.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.893
What did I do?

05:59.927 --> 06:00.994
I was just in
the neighborhood.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.630
I thought I'd drop in.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.531
Mm-hmm.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.565
Why?

06:04.598 --> 06:05.466
Nothing.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.268
Just to hang.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.102
Come on in.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.544
Wow.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.978
So, Spielberg's your man, huh?

06:18.011 --> 06:19.246
Yeah.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.415
I'm going to work for him
someday, learn everything

06:21.449 --> 06:23.817
I can from him, then become
this huge movie director

06:23.851 --> 06:24.652
and crush him.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.525
You are your mother's son.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.894
Where did you get these?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.629
Uh, friends.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.732
I just sort of found the rest.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.834
You found them?

06:40.868 --> 06:43.303
Yeah, you know how you're
walking through the city,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.372
and you're not really
looking for anything,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.941
and all the sudden you look
down and there's a sign?

06:53.914 --> 06:56.249
Yeah, I used to find
mine on the tops of poles

06:56.283 --> 06:58.952
at the end of the street.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.053
What'd you do this stuff too?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.154
Oh, yeah.

07:01.188 --> 07:04.357
It was what you call
your regular wild youth.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.959
I remember one time, me
and some buddies of mine

07:05.993 --> 07:07.360
broke into a junkyard.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.762
We got chased by
this big doberman.

07:08.796 --> 07:09.663
Oh, man.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.731
Did you get bit?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.099
No, DJ.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.135
See, the trick is, you don't
have to be faster than the dog.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.737
You just got to be faster
than one of your friends.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.246
So did you get in big
trouble with your parents?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.916
No, I could always
get away with stuff.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.720
My dad wasn't around
much, and my mom, well--

07:32.753 --> 07:34.387
Yeah, I know about Grandma.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.960
Well, I guess I should go.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.799
Are you OK?

07:45.833 --> 07:46.700
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.701
I'm just moving a little slow.

07:50.938 --> 07:54.608
Well, you look
kind of out of it.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.910
No, I'm just thinking.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.548
Thinking and out of
it look a lot alike.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.349
You know, I'm not
kidding anymore, dad.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.250
We can talk about stuff.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.184
No, that's right.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.186
You're not a kid
anymore, Are you?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.154
You're dating.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.289
Next year you're
going to be driving.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.457
Why you're almost a man.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.161
I'm not shaving yet.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.164
Ah, It's a hassle anyway.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.801
You know, you're getting to
the age DJ, where a lot of kids

08:20.834 --> 08:22.369
stop getting along
with their parents.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.137
I hope that doesn't
happen to us.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.073
Yeah, I hope you don't get
all weird on like some kids'

08:26.106 --> 08:26.907
parents.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.249
How am I doing so far?

08:36.283 --> 08:39.720
I'd say you have
like a 3.7 average.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.488
Hell, that's way better
than I did in high school.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.062
I enjoyed this.

08:53.901 --> 08:57.605
Sure, stop by any time.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.872
Yeah.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.209
Your mom won't let me put
up cool stuff in my room.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.545
[music playing]

09:08.081 --> 09:10.984
I see that.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.385
Read them and weep, gentlemen.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.987
Full house.

09:14.021 --> 09:14.888
Oh, man.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.123
I was this close.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.124
Yeah.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.325
If you'd picked up
three more queens

09:18.358 --> 09:21.595
you might have won that hand.

09:21.629 --> 09:25.498
So David, Darlene let you
out to play tonight, huh?

09:25.532 --> 09:30.604
Oh, actually she
sort of insisted on it.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.239
Since she's been
pregnant, she says I've

09:32.272 --> 09:35.175
been kind of hovering over her.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.477
You know, David it's
kind of a poker tradition

09:37.510 --> 09:39.780
that the guys complain
about their wives.

09:42.549 --> 09:43.550
Oh, I'd rather not.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.252
Oh, come on.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.087
[interposing voices]

09:47.120 --> 09:48.922
All right.

09:48.956 --> 09:49.823
No, all right.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.059
Fine.

09:52.092 --> 10:00.367
Sometimes-- sometimes Darlene
won't let me do all the things

10:00.400 --> 10:01.434
I want to do for her.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.705
And it just, it makes me so mad.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.044
Damn mad.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.549
This boy is a pathetic
result of the woman's

10:16.583 --> 10:19.352
liberation movement.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.354
Well Dan, it's good to see
you've pulled out of that funk.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.622
You know, after we
talked at The Lobo,

10:22.656 --> 10:24.357
I was actually a little
worried about you.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.793
Eh, I was just a
little off this morning.

10:25.826 --> 10:29.730
I got up on Rosie's
side of the bed.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.198
You were in a
funk, Mr. Connor?

10:31.231 --> 10:32.332
Oh, yeah.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.534
He was asking me for the
reason we're all here.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.368
Where?

10:40.774 --> 10:41.875
You were getting
philosophical?

10:41.909 --> 10:43.643
That doesn't sound
like you, Dan.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.845
Yeah, well.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.014
You know what I do
when I'm in a funk?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.750
I lay on top of the trailer
and count the stars.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.618
There's like a hundred of them.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.626
David, you always look
like you're in a funk.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.460
No I don't.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.598
Really?

11:05.632 --> 11:08.035
Are we here to
play cards or what?

11:08.068 --> 11:11.338
All right, five card draw,
trips to win, suicide kings won.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.206
Sounds good.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.775
Hey, after the game
tonight, any you guys

11:14.808 --> 11:16.376
want to go shoot some pool?

11:16.409 --> 11:18.278
No, the wife is going
to wait up for me.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.380
I don't know what's gotten
into her since she's hit 40,

11:20.413 --> 11:22.349
but I ain't complaining.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.184
Whoa.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.085
I know what you mean.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.319
When Scott turned the big 4-0.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.125
I tell you, it was like
somebody set off a bomb

11:32.159 --> 11:33.526
at the testosterone factory.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.203
I lost count.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.306
How many-- how
many cards you got?

11:46.339 --> 11:48.441
I think we all have about 11.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.145
Somebody else deal.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.081
I've got to go see
about something.

11:54.114 --> 11:54.982
You won all the money.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.750
You just can't walk away, Dan.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.619
I'll let Mark play my hand.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.520
Oh.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.556
Take your time.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.459
Deal me out, guys.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.128
David.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.064
What are you doing?
- Shuffling.

[crickets chirping]

12:19.106 --> 12:22.675
Hey, what's going on, man?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.577
Nothing, I just come
out to get some fresh air.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.412
Yeah.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.051
Um, hey Dan.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.253
You know, I hadn't thanked
you enough, you know,

12:33.286 --> 12:34.221
for the money and all.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.122
Oh, man.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.256
That's OK.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.625
You know, living room
needed painting anyway.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.893
You do a bad job, I
know where you live.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.599
What's on your mind, Dan?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.235
I don't know, it's--

12:48.268 --> 12:51.538
lately I've been having all
these questions about life,

12:51.571 --> 12:58.445
and stuff I've done, and oh man,
you're going to think I'm nuts.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.679
Not anymore than I did before.

13:04.918 --> 13:09.289
I-- I think you need
to lighten up, Dan.

13:09.322 --> 13:13.760
I mean, you're a good guy.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.430
And all the time, not since
you came into all this money.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.966
So you got nothing
to worry about.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.167
Yeah, look.

13:20.200 --> 13:25.338
I'm just going to hang
out here for a while, OK?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.173
Yeah, OK.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.956
Come to mama, girls.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.958
Damn it, I had
an ace that time.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.498
Where's Dan?

13:51.531 --> 13:52.832
Hey Rosie.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.666
Dan's on the front porch.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.538
OK, gentlemen,
what's your pleasure?

13:58.571 --> 13:59.472
Seven stud?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.674
Hold 'em, five card draw?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.944
How about five card stud, but
each player gets as many cards

14:03.977 --> 14:06.246
as he wants.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.747
All right, I'll take 52.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.322
[dog barking]

14:16.856 --> 14:19.726
The aliens aren't going to
take you if you act too eager.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.299
I just had to take a
break to clear my head.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.667
Really?

14:27.700 --> 14:28.969
I would have thought
that sitting there

14:29.002 --> 14:30.437
with them for an hour
would have sucked

14:30.470 --> 14:31.338
everything right out of it.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.311
I'm going to take a
walk for a while, OK?

14:46.253 --> 14:49.589
[music playing]

14:54.627 --> 14:56.964
Why do we have to
have wheat grass now?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.465
Because it's the thing to do.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.001
And we are now the people
who do the things to do,

15:01.034 --> 15:04.204
whether we want
to do them or not.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.739
But why can't we just wait
till we go to the spa?

15:06.773 --> 15:09.676
No, I'm not going to
chance some allergic reaction

15:09.709 --> 15:11.378
and blow up to four
times my normal size

15:11.411 --> 15:12.879
in front of those people.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.214
Just drink it.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.415
All right.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.618
But you don't get any
lime or salt or anything?

15:18.651 --> 15:21.754
Listen, in Vanity Fair, they
said that this is the stuff

15:21.788 --> 15:24.191
that that Demi Moore drank
to get her figure back

15:24.224 --> 15:25.625
after she had all of them kids.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.526
Really?

15:26.559 --> 15:30.063
[glass clinking]

15:30.097 --> 15:30.964
Gah!

15:30.998 --> 15:31.931
Lord.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.634
Lord, god.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.468
Oh.

15:39.206 --> 15:42.475
Tastes just like grass.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.445
Are my teeth green?

15:45.478 --> 15:46.646
No, they're still yellow.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.885
Oh, I have got to get some
new clothes for the spa.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.755
Everything I have
stinks like Lanford.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.057
Well, that's why
we went and bought

15:57.090 --> 16:00.627
all these $10 magazines,
Jackie, to get you looking hip.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.429
I am tired of
being the happening

16:02.462 --> 16:05.498
one in this relationship.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.399
Oh my god look.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.768
Look at this here.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.370
Feng Shui.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.371
What?

16:11.404 --> 16:14.041
Feng Shui.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.177
The ancient Chinese art of
arranging your furniture

16:17.210 --> 16:19.079
and other objects so
that you can better live

16:19.112 --> 16:21.248
in harmony in your environment.

16:27.054 --> 16:30.123
Can't be done.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.725
Well, it says here that
Barbra Streisand will not

16:32.759 --> 16:34.694
even set foot in
her house until it

16:34.727 --> 16:38.031
had been totally Feng Shui-ed.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.868
That sounds like Barbara.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.636
God, I love her.

16:43.670 --> 16:47.240
I heard she had her chin
done and just left the nose.

16:47.274 --> 16:51.010
That's class.

16:51.044 --> 16:55.215
Next year's fashion news,
Roseanne, heroin chic is out.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.850
Waitress meets schoolmarm is in.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.053
Well I guess next
year's your year, Jackie.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.425
You know that Dalai Lama dude?

17:05.458 --> 17:09.896
He goes out on tour more
than the Rolling Stones.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.365
Now does he live
with Richard Gere?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.003
No, he's a holy man.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.338
He lives in the
mountains somewhere.

17:18.371 --> 17:22.242
But I think they just
have the same publicist.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.343
Hey, hun.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.544
I'm going to go out
and run a few errands.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.512
I'll be back in a bit.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.980
Dan, it's Monday
Night Football.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.816
You haven't left this
house on a Monday night

17:29.849 --> 17:33.386
in damn near 18 years.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.687
Well, it will be in
the paper tomorrow.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.628
He's getting worse.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.829
I know that, Jackie.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.964
I'm just trying to enjoy
what's left of my denial.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.236
Wow.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.738
What?

17:51.771 --> 17:54.707
Had a wheat grass rush.

[music playing]

18:07.354 --> 18:08.555
What are you doing, Dan?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.756
We hired Chuck to
paint this room.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.591
Oh, no, I just thought
I'd prep it for him.

18:11.624 --> 18:15.128
I know where all the
holes are and everything.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.796
Yeah, so, all right.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.098
What's really going on, Dan?

18:19.132 --> 18:20.533
I'm spackling.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.869
Well, it's 11:00
at night, and you've

18:22.902 --> 18:24.871
just spackled over an outlets.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.973
So do you really want to
tell me what's going on?

18:27.006 --> 18:29.842
What?

18:29.876 --> 18:32.479
I've been really patient with
you for the past three days,

18:32.512 --> 18:33.613
but I want to know what's wrong.

18:39.519 --> 18:44.123
You know, Rosie, I'm a good
father and a decent husband,

18:44.157 --> 18:46.926
but I am a lousy son.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.495
Lousy son?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.862
Where's this all coming from?

18:49.896 --> 18:53.065
Well, you know, my
life's getting better.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.235
But my mom's in a
psychiatric hospital,

18:55.268 --> 18:58.305
and nothing changes for her.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.573
Last time I went to see her,
she didn't even know who I was.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.875
So I stayed for
all of 30 minutes.

19:02.909 --> 19:06.145
Well, you can't go being
hard on yourself, Dan.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.947
You've done every
single thing you can do.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.417
Yeah, well she
deserves better.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.785
She was a great mom.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.422
I mean, when I was
a kid, I didn't

19:15.455 --> 19:17.190
think she was weird at all.

19:17.224 --> 19:20.360
She was funny and wild,
you know, in a good way.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.195
No, she was totally awesome.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.964
Remember that one time where
we were just going to go out

19:24.997 --> 19:27.934
for ice cream, and then she just
happened to show up with ice

19:27.967 --> 19:30.537
cream and it was the
exact same flavors that we

19:30.570 --> 19:31.504
were going to go out and get?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.273
It was like she was psychic.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.408
I remember.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.545
Well maybe she's not in
such bad shape after all.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.146
You know?

19:40.179 --> 19:43.316
Because I mean, when you're
pour and act different,

19:43.350 --> 19:46.052
everybody automatically
assumes that you're crazy.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.154
But when you're rich and
you act different, I mean,

19:48.187 --> 19:51.558
they just call you eccentric.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.059
I would love to
take her to a place

19:53.092 --> 19:55.462
and get a real good diagnosis.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.863
You know, something
really thorough,

19:56.896 --> 19:59.632
find out what's
really wrong with her.

19:59.666 --> 20:04.036
So, I've been looking around
and I heard about this place

20:04.070 --> 20:07.707
in California, in Santa
Monica that she could go to.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.779
So now that I've got the dough,
I'm going to take her there.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.115
I'm not going to go on
the spa trip with you.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.584
Well yeah, definitely.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.352
You got way more
fun things to do.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.920
I think that's a great idea.

20:20.953 --> 20:21.754
I'm glad you're doing that.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.465
God, look at this mess.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.800
Why the hell did I start this?

20:37.570 --> 20:40.973
Cause it needed to be
done sooner or later, Dan.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.409
Just another one
of those things we

20:42.442 --> 20:46.546
put off for way, way too long.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.847
Yeah, we should've
kept up with it.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.050
It's a shame that we
let it get this far.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.519
It wasn't our fault, Dan.

20:52.552 --> 20:56.088
We didn't have the time,
and we didn't have the money.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.057
But we do now.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.326
Yeah.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.593
What do you say, before I
put the lids of the cans,

21:00.627 --> 21:01.794
you want to paint
crap on the wall?

Yeah, give me that roller.
