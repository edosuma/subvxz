01:15.542 --> 01:19.344
Whoa! Granny, how did I not
notice your humongo muff?

01:20.512 --> 01:21.546
Yeah.

Oh, oh, oh, oh! Hey!

01:46.217 --> 01:47.708
Put down that spanakopita.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.708
Friday's the big day.
I need you looking fit.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.581
- What's Friday?
- "What's Friday?"

01:51.689 --> 01:53.088
Come on, Granny. You kidding me?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.647
Friday is the photo shoot for
the Fireman Beefcake Calendar.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.183
Like, hello? It's only the
biggest day of the year.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.384
Hello!

01:59.386 --> 02:01.266
I need you to get beefy, Granny, okay?

02:01.455 --> 02:05.191
Station 48 sold 1,000 copies of
their calendar last month alone.

02:05.397 --> 02:06.725
You think I'm gonna let us get outsold

02:06.727 --> 02:08.193
by these hideous gargoyles?

02:08.195 --> 02:11.730
No. No. Look at this guy.
Joe Manganiello wannabe.

02:12.317 --> 02:13.932
When are we gonna
stop these competitions

02:13.934 --> 02:15.725
with other fire stations, huh?

02:16.070 --> 02:17.536
My butthole is still burning

02:17.538 --> 02:19.204
from the ghost-pepper challenge video.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.073
Oh, yeah. How many ghost
peppers did you put in your butt?

02:21.075 --> 02:23.765
- Like 12?
- And yet only 11 came out.

02:23.908 --> 02:25.744
- Strange, Granny.
- I don't know about you guys,

02:25.746 --> 02:27.546
but I am ready for the big shoot.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.414
I haven't had a carb in three weeks.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.216
Good for you, but I got to tell ya,

02:31.218 --> 02:33.308
the key really is to
be as oily as possible.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.794
Now, a little trade secret...

02:34.818 --> 02:36.621
in my other life, I'm a
professional male dancer.

02:36.623 --> 02:37.663
Not sure if you know that.

02:37.687 --> 02:39.743
And looking bad is not an option.

02:39.871 --> 02:43.272
That's why I trust generic
brand Canyon Breeze Baby Oil.

02:43.540 --> 02:44.763
Canyon Breeze?

02:44.765 --> 02:47.031
Canyon Breeze...
America's number-one choice

02:47.033 --> 02:48.618
for high-performance stage oil.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.850
♪ Canyon Breeze ♪

02:51.705 --> 02:54.239
No, no. You remember what happened
last year when we got too oily.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.040
Nice technique. Good.

03:01.363 --> 03:02.624
Aah!

03:02.982 --> 03:03.982
Ohh!

03:08.255 --> 03:09.752
Ahh...

03:09.863 --> 03:11.323
Last year was last year.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.232
Last year, my mom didn't
even put up the calendar.

03:13.256 --> 03:15.057
She said it was borderline pornographic.

03:15.082 --> 03:16.972
Yeah, but your mom thinks
"Dancing with the Stars"

03:16.996 --> 03:18.132
is borderline pornographic.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.464
Well, anything on ABC.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.662
But look. This is the annual
beefcake calendar, okay?

03:22.803 --> 03:24.603
It's not about pleasing our families.

03:24.744 --> 03:27.612
It's about vanity, ego, competition,

03:28.366 --> 03:30.376
you know, and charity, I suppose.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.268
- What charity?
- Primates for Pets.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.589
They provide helper monkeys
for retired service animals.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.492
Aww!

03:37.351 --> 03:38.623
The world has changed.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.486
Issues of workplace
sexuality are delicate.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.021
All right, well, you
can't take the beefiness

03:43.023 --> 03:44.399
out of the beefcake calendar.

03:44.502 --> 03:45.947
It's a point of pride for my guys.

03:45.972 --> 03:47.656
This is coming from up high, Terry.

03:47.681 --> 03:48.721
You know it's not me.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.163
I'm the dirtiest gal
in all of City Hall.

03:51.165 --> 03:53.231
Last year's Secret
Santa, I gave Polly Purdue

03:53.233 --> 03:55.228
a mug that said "Men are like coffee.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.945
The good ones keep
you up all night long."

04:01.305 --> 04:02.639
Oh, my gosh!

04:02.777 --> 04:04.442
All right, but, honestly,
what does this mean?

04:04.444 --> 04:06.779
- What are the parameters?
- Nothing hard and fast.

04:07.661 --> 04:08.765
 You see?!

04:08.849 --> 04:11.689
I'm like Sarah Silverman over
here with the raunchiness!

04:11.811 --> 04:13.580
- Funny.
- It's common sense, really.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.854
- No more bare butt.
- Adorable.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.457
No more using live animals
to cover private parts.

04:19.156 --> 04:20.257
Sharp claws.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.861
And no more using fire hoses to suggest

04:22.863 --> 04:25.226
the functions of the male genitalia.

04:25.512 --> 04:26.799
Oh, yeah. I didn't see that before.

04:26.801 --> 04:28.874
Huh. You're tying our hands here.

04:28.899 --> 04:30.402
Just think of it as a challenge.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.471
Come up with a nice, wholesome calendar

04:32.473 --> 04:33.991
that has some redeeming value.

04:34.170 --> 04:37.319
Redeeming values? I don't
even know what that means.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.878
Okay, I'm not happy about it,
either, but maybe she's got a point.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.546
- Nah. Come on, Chief.
- What point? What?

04:41.548 --> 04:42.747
- What do you mean?
- No way!

04:42.749 --> 04:44.683
Well, maybe we pushed this
thing into the territory

04:44.685 --> 04:46.432
unbecoming of a professional operation.

04:46.457 --> 04:48.420
But you can't do that! I
mean, I was gonna do this bit

04:48.422 --> 04:50.921
where I covered my unmentionables
in extinguisher foam.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.454
It was gonna be so hot!

04:52.479 --> 04:53.492
You were gonna do this?

04:53.494 --> 04:55.322
Why wouldn't I? I'm a firefighter.

04:55.386 --> 04:57.295
Well, you know, I-I just figured
it was a beefcake calendar,

04:57.319 --> 04:58.831
so it'd be limited to the beefs.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.034
That is sexist.

05:00.234 --> 05:03.035
Chief, like it or not,
part of being a firefighter

05:03.037 --> 05:06.707
is the inalienable right to
pose seductively for a calendar

05:06.732 --> 05:09.041
that people give to their
spinster aunt as a gag gift.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.909
- Yeah!
- Goddamn right!

05:10.911 --> 05:12.244
Goddamn right! Come on!

05:12.246 --> 05:14.513
- Hallelujah!
- Okay. Great point.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.893
In the meantime, I would
love for everyone to come up

05:17.918 --> 05:20.118
with a wholesome concept
for this calendar shoot.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.253
- Ugh.
- No!

05:21.255 --> 05:23.188
- Why?!
- Carry on.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.924
This is four Sundays 
in a row you've missed church.

05:25.926 --> 05:29.194
I know, Mom, but they have
me working on Sundays now.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.463
Ha, ha, ha. That girl is hot A.F., huh?

05:31.465 --> 05:33.598
Pfft. Shoot! Huh!

05:33.600 --> 05:34.733
Who are you talking to?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.512
Who's hot A.F.? Are you dating a girl?

05:36.655 --> 05:39.071
How come you won't call any of
the nice girls I set you up with?

05:39.073 --> 05:41.005
Mom, I... It was just 
something on the TV, okay?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.607
What are they making
you watch over there?

05:42.609 --> 05:43.808
"Dancing with the Stars"?

05:43.810 --> 05:46.679
Okay, Mom, uh, I got to
go. Okay? But I lov...

05:46.681 --> 05:51.149
Ha, ha, ha! Yeah! No, you shut up!

05:51.151 --> 05:52.417
Ah, totally!

05:53.620 --> 05:56.088
My dudes are crazy!

05:56.090 --> 05:57.289
How's your mom?

05:57.719 --> 05:58.957
You know, sh...

05:58.959 --> 06:01.360
She's just so disapproving
of everything, you know?

06:01.362 --> 06:03.962
Well, maybe next year, we'll
do a Fun Run for charity.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.365
Yeah, she thinks
jogging is erotic, so...

06:06.367 --> 06:07.766
It's calendar time!

06:07.768 --> 06:09.367
- Chiefy.
- Awesome!

06:09.369 --> 06:11.035
All right. Who's kicking
off the brainstorm?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.504
Okay, yeah, yeah. Let me start, okay?

06:12.506 --> 06:15.708
Because this is a slam dunk, all right?

06:16.038 --> 06:20.256
Let's do the photo spread
covered in raw meat and pastry.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.316
Nobody? Guys, come on.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.018
Raw meat... beef. Pastry... cake.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.925
Beefcake. Right? Perfect.

06:31.268 --> 06:33.250
We'll get local businesses
to donate the food,

06:33.275 --> 06:34.940
then we auction it off after we're done.

06:34.965 --> 06:36.432
- That's gross.
- No. Boo.

06:36.457 --> 06:38.053
- What?
- Auction used meat?

06:38.187 --> 06:40.754
- Whatever.
- All right, next. Come on. Let's go.

06:40.779 --> 06:43.913
Okay, so, we are looking
for unsexy, right?

06:43.938 --> 06:45.187
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

06:45.212 --> 06:49.380
What's more un-sexy than
puppet versions of ourselves?

06:49.405 --> 06:50.809
- What does that mean?
- Okay, you know what?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.474
Maybe you'll be more
receptive to this idea

06:53.747 --> 06:55.842
if it's presented by...

06:56.355 --> 06:58.483
Fireman Bob!

06:58.873 --> 06:59.884
Oh, boy.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.020
So, uh, you all making
a calendar of sorts?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.065
Ha, ha. Is that it?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.454
- Boo, boo.
- Boo!

07:04.479 --> 07:05.621
How does that even work?

07:05.646 --> 07:06.959
You dummies wouldn't know a good idea

07:06.961 --> 07:08.157
if it bit you on the behind!

07:09.764 --> 07:12.697
Okay. Enough with your
puppet. Next! Come on, next.

07:12.699 --> 07:16.101
What if we all pose
in respectful portraits

07:16.103 --> 07:18.087
with our respective mothers?

07:18.172 --> 07:21.817
And, uh, we're wearing costumes
that celebrate our heritage,

07:22.004 --> 07:24.042
so I'd do Hawaii, obviously.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.244
- And you would do... white?
- Okay, no...

07:26.246 --> 07:27.512
No, no, no, no, no.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.981
- Boo!
- No. Boo, boo, boo.

07:28.983 --> 07:32.184
Okay, when's the last time
any of you saw firefighters

07:32.186 --> 07:34.715
posing with gigantic
fruits and vegetables?

07:34.921 --> 07:37.055
That's not hot, Cap.
That's just bizarre.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.192
Mm. Believe me, Ike, nudity is passé.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.010
Bizarre is the new nudity.

07:42.241 --> 07:43.503
That sounds like a perfume commercial.

07:43.527 --> 07:45.167
Yeah, it sounds like
a perfume commercial.

07:45.237 --> 07:46.704
Chief, I can tell you're intrigued.

07:46.801 --> 07:48.126
Well, we're supposed to do something

07:48.150 --> 07:49.230
with redeeming value, right?

07:49.254 --> 07:50.920
Fruits, vegetables, food groups...

07:51.005 --> 07:52.270
something for the kids.

07:53.316 --> 07:54.379
I like it.

07:55.009 --> 07:57.942
Run with it, Penisi. Good meeting.

07:58.719 --> 08:00.813
This is the most ridiculous
idea I've ever heard!

08:00.815 --> 08:03.682
Fruits and vegetables? Are
you having an aneurysm, Cap?

08:03.684 --> 08:06.020
Yeah, having an aneurysm like a fox.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.095
We can be naked behind the food.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.089
Natural, delicious foods

08:11.091 --> 08:13.719
presented by au naturel firefighters.

08:14.028 --> 08:16.619
It's the perfect Trojan
horse. Think about it.

08:16.968 --> 08:18.557
Who's gonna call you out for being naked

08:18.581 --> 08:20.141
as long as the food pyramid's involved?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.846
- Nobody.
- Nobody.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.196
- Nobody.
- Cap! I could kiss you.

08:24.221 --> 08:26.128
Well, you better do it now,
'cause in a couple days,

08:26.152 --> 08:27.239
I'm gonna be naked and oily

08:27.241 --> 08:29.241
with a gigantic stalk
of nutritious asparagus

08:29.243 --> 08:30.292
right in front of my wang!

08:37.149 --> 08:39.059
Oh, that's what I like to see...

08:39.085 --> 08:40.885
some hard, buff bodies for our wholesome

08:40.886 --> 08:42.422
and healthy beefcake calendar.

08:42.447 --> 08:44.222
We're gonna out-sell
every station in town.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.698
- You got that right.
- Ooh! Ho, ho, ho! Okay.

08:48.007 --> 08:50.428
Which one of you has been doing one
of those stanky-ass cleanse diets?

08:50.430 --> 08:51.896
Sauerkraut butt blast.

08:51.898 --> 08:55.293
- The paprika mega-purge.
- The cayenne clinch. Ahh.

08:55.318 --> 08:57.343
- I've just been doing Weight Watchers.
- Sensible.

08:57.368 --> 08:58.976
Hey, guys, let me get
your opinion on something.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.975
I'm thinking about
growing my nip hairs out.

09:01.248 --> 09:02.683
I think they're making a comeback,

09:02.708 --> 09:04.042
and I do want to be on trend, so...

09:04.044 --> 09:06.378
Lucky for you, the unibrow
is making a comeback.

09:07.914 --> 09:10.382
And you need a once-over
with those ear and nose hairs,

09:10.384 --> 09:12.571
- old timer.
- Hey, watch it, whippersnapper.

09:12.596 --> 09:14.374
Hey, Andy, doesn't your mom run a salon?

09:14.399 --> 09:16.321
Maybe she can give us all, like,
a friends and family discount.

09:16.345 --> 09:17.900
Yeah, I don't know.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.058
I think there's something
weirdly sexual about my mom

09:20.060 --> 09:21.660
pouring hot wax on your bodies.

09:21.788 --> 09:22.795
Hey, hey.

09:22.797 --> 09:24.997
Uh, then we're definitely
doing it, like 100%.

09:25.535 --> 09:26.909
- Settled.
- Maybe she can take a look

09:26.933 --> 09:28.667
- at Granny's humongous muff.
- Dude.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.135
Yeah, maybe she's got a weed
whacker in the back of her salon.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.737
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Time-out.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.673
Nobody's touching my briar patch, okay?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.741
Remember Samson in the Bible? All right?

09:36.743 --> 09:39.336
You cut off the bird's
nest, I lose my manhood.

09:39.493 --> 09:41.013
- Not happening.
- Ugh!

09:41.574 --> 09:44.069
It smells like a Dumpster behind
a Hungarian restaurant in here.

09:44.093 --> 09:45.576
- We're all fartin'.
- We're all doing

09:45.601 --> 09:47.486
- different master cleanses.
- I'm doing Weight Watchers.

09:47.488 --> 09:49.648
Probie, go to my bathroom
and get the pot-pourri spray.

09:49.859 --> 09:52.735
Oh, great, now it'll smell
like shit and pot-pourri.

09:52.949 --> 09:55.214
Huh. Master cleanses
and vanity workouts, huh?

09:55.293 --> 09:57.515
Seems unnecessary for
a food-group calendar.

09:57.709 --> 09:59.309
We're just trying to
stay healthy, Chief.

09:59.426 --> 10:00.648
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

10:00.673 --> 10:02.251
- You sure?
- Poz.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.036
- You should try it sometime.
- What'd you say?

10:04.038 --> 10:05.298
- Hmm?
- You say something?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.662
Uh, I said we're just trying
to stay healthy, Chief.

10:07.686 --> 10:09.483
Okay. It stinks in here.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.466
Mm-hmm.

10:13.253 --> 10:15.547
Okay, so, we'll meet up

10:15.595 --> 10:17.382
at Andy's mom's place after work, right?

10:17.384 --> 10:18.650
On one condition, though.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.653
Nobody say anything about the calendar.

10:20.678 --> 10:21.816
She'd go nuts.

10:22.935 --> 10:24.014
I gotta go.

10:24.039 --> 10:25.546
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Unh!

10:29.109 --> 10:30.109
Hi.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.079
Ooh, cool!

10:32.752 --> 10:35.753
Alo-Air... Alao... Alo-hay-ir.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.549
Ala... Hair-ah...

10:38.588 --> 10:40.211
Bah! I give up! How do you say it?

10:40.782 --> 10:42.849
Hey! Ka'ponko!

10:42.874 --> 10:44.610
- Hey, Mom. Hi.
- Hi, honey.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.692
Ka'ponko? What's... What's Ka'ponko?

10:46.756 --> 10:48.536
Oh, my Hawaiian name is Ka'ponko.

10:48.666 --> 10:49.798
- Oh.
- Oh.

10:50.063 --> 10:51.797
What are we doing today? A butt wax?

10:51.822 --> 10:53.739
Or are we just touching
up around the ding-a-ling?

10:53.763 --> 10:55.455
Ooh. Uh...

10:55.480 --> 10:58.348
- I'll do the usual.
- Oh, okay, all three. All right.

10:58.373 --> 10:59.897
Hey, let's get smooth, huh?

10:59.937 --> 11:01.684
- Hey, get smooth!
- Smooth.

11:03.265 --> 11:04.314
That's a new feeling.

11:04.339 --> 11:07.278
You should have seem my son
after his first butt wax.

11:07.438 --> 11:09.582
- He cried for days!
- Mom!

11:11.894 --> 11:14.041
Aw, but, Andy's Mom, I
think that's just Ka'ponko

11:14.043 --> 11:15.254
being Ka'ponko, though, right?

11:15.279 --> 11:18.035
- That's our Ka'ponko!
- Classic Ka'ponko.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.198
Total Ka'ponko.

11:19.223 --> 11:20.237
Mm-hmm!

11:22.186 --> 11:27.060
Ooh. That is a lot of hair.

11:27.085 --> 11:29.824
Let me see here. Yikes!

11:29.849 --> 11:32.575
Hey, did you sneak a
Portuguese Water Dog in here?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.172
Read the sign... "No pets."

11:34.197 --> 11:35.801
Oh, no, ma'am. With all due respect,

11:35.826 --> 11:39.266
I will pass on the
waxing of my low 'fro.

11:39.308 --> 11:42.041
Oh, don't be silly. Everybody in
my Bible study group's doing it.

11:42.066 --> 11:43.495
Oh, Granny, just do it.
Then you'll be all nice

11:43.519 --> 11:44.794
and trim for the beefcake calendar.

11:44.818 --> 11:46.002
What? Beefcake?

11:46.027 --> 11:48.161
Aaaaaaah!

11:48.186 --> 11:50.220
I don't do porn stars! Get out!

11:50.503 --> 11:52.059
It's gonna be a nice calendar, Mom.

11:52.084 --> 11:53.322
That's what you said last year

11:53.347 --> 11:54.801
when you grabbed the fire hydrant

11:54.826 --> 11:57.827
between your legs to suggest
how the male genitalia functions!

11:57.852 --> 12:00.201
- Well, you wax buttholes!
- Out, out, out!

12:00.226 --> 12:04.116
I will not have you taint the
dignity of the Myawani name!

12:04.141 --> 12:06.208
The woman does know
a thing or two about taints.

12:06.287 --> 12:09.514
- Not funny! Get out! Get out, get out!
- Hey, whoa! Hey!

12:09.539 --> 12:11.263
Out, cowboy boots!

12:11.288 --> 12:12.295
Thank you.

12:16.981 --> 12:18.703
Oh, God! I can't walk!

12:19.332 --> 12:20.507
You guys, don't break the fruit.

12:20.509 --> 12:21.906
We have to use it for the calendar.

12:24.555 --> 12:26.738
This calendar is gonna be bananas.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.640
How you holding up, Granny?

12:29.852 --> 12:32.446
Had to shave it bald
to get all the wax off.

12:32.549 --> 12:35.283
And it's gone. It's all gone.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.721
Am I the only one freezing in here?

12:43.623 --> 12:45.171
"Excuse me, sir, have
you, uh, had your picture

12:45.195 --> 12:47.561
taken before with fruits and vegetables
covering your unmentionables?"

12:47.585 --> 12:49.291
"Um, yeah, well, you
know, I've done, uh...

12:49.316 --> 12:50.539
I've done pickle, I've done cucumber,

12:50.563 --> 12:51.763
I've done, uh, squash, eggplant.

12:51.787 --> 12:53.321
Never a, uh, chili
pepper, though, so..."

12:53.345 --> 12:54.744
How great is this banana?

12:54.769 --> 12:56.803
If only I could pull back
the peels and then use that

12:56.827 --> 12:58.693
to cover my melons,
you know what I mean?

12:58.876 --> 12:59.970
Awesome.

13:00.134 --> 13:02.335
Seems like the nudity's creeping
back into this photo shoot!

13:02.359 --> 13:04.226
Oh, yeah! It's gonna be epic, Chief!

13:04.251 --> 13:05.573
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

13:05.597 --> 13:07.113
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

13:07.138 --> 13:08.520
It's clean. It's on the up-and-up.

13:08.545 --> 13:09.935
- You sure?
- Yeah, you said no nudity.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.229
There's gonna be no... n-no nudity.

13:11.253 --> 13:13.454
Yeah. Fruits and vegetables. What
can we possibly do that's dirty?

13:13.478 --> 13:14.494
No nudity.

13:16.334 --> 13:18.237
- You take my picture.
- Ohh!

13:19.769 --> 13:21.701
N-o-o-o-o!

13:42.045 --> 13:43.088
Hmm.

13:48.302 --> 13:50.333
Release it all over.

13:50.358 --> 13:52.359
Sorry about your pants,
Cap, but that's, you know...

13:52.383 --> 13:53.654
So, as you can see,

13:53.930 --> 13:55.996
you got more of a general shine

13:56.021 --> 13:57.158
- going here, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:57.182 --> 14:00.248
Whereas my Canyon Breeze,
more of a shimmer, you know?

14:00.273 --> 14:02.330
- More of a show. Boop
- Yeah, I see.

14:02.355 --> 14:04.245
Got a nice scent, too. That's not bad.

14:04.516 --> 14:06.061
I mean, that smells great.

14:06.086 --> 14:08.687
- Right?
- It's like vanilla with jasmine.

14:09.003 --> 14:10.913
Hey, hold on, you guys. Is
that what the Canyon Breeze is?

14:10.937 --> 14:13.397
- Yeah.
- Tough day for both of us, huh?

14:13.712 --> 14:15.595
Yeah, but your pubes will grown back,

14:15.620 --> 14:17.947
and my issue with my mom
is gonna go on forever.

14:19.006 --> 14:20.606
You know, I was raised
by my grandmother.

14:21.022 --> 14:23.547
She said the same thing,
till a few years ago,

14:23.989 --> 14:26.701
I finally had enough, and I
walked straight up to Granny.

14:27.368 --> 14:30.570
I said, "Granny, I'm a
grown-ass man. No more."

14:30.595 --> 14:32.662
Granny said, "Don't
talk to me like that."

14:32.687 --> 14:33.887
I said, "Granny, hear me out."

14:34.029 --> 14:36.329
Granny said, "You go
to your room right now."

14:36.586 --> 14:39.319
"Granny, I'm not going to
my room anymore, Granny."

14:39.448 --> 14:42.011
"Granny, don't talk to me like
that! I said go to your room!"

14:42.036 --> 14:45.011
"Well, Granny's time to go
to Granny's room is over!"

14:46.161 --> 14:48.029
And that's when I
think Granny understood.

14:48.198 --> 14:51.347
Or should I say...
Granny understood Granny.

14:52.595 --> 14:54.954
I'm sorry. You lost me so long ago.

14:54.979 --> 14:56.749
Point is, is that you
got to let her know

14:57.059 --> 14:58.725
that you can make your own decisions.

14:58.846 --> 15:01.381
And tell her that you're
doing that beefcake calendar.

15:01.489 --> 15:03.823
No, you're right. Yeah. I'm gonna do it.

15:04.095 --> 15:05.895
- Thanks, Granny.
- That's what I'm talking about.

15:05.919 --> 15:07.425
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that pressure okay?

15:07.450 --> 15:09.577
- Mm, mm-hmm, mm.
- Mm, Mm-hmm.

15:09.602 --> 15:11.370
- There you go.
- Yeah.

15:11.395 --> 15:13.364
Feels like a lot, but it's
not that much. Ah, it is.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.246
It's quite a bit. Might go
down into your pants a bit.

15:15.270 --> 15:18.137
Oh, my God. My skin is, like,
absorbing this like a sponge.

15:18.176 --> 15:20.028
Yeah, yeah. You know what you
got to do? You got to relax.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.194
- Okay.
- Get my arm. Come on.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.012
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

15:25.037 --> 15:27.069
Can I have your attention,
please? Listen up here, guys.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.693
I just got of the
phone with Linda Price.

15:28.743 --> 15:30.482
Apparently she got word
that you guys were trying

15:30.506 --> 15:32.061
to sneak nudity into this new concept.

15:32.086 --> 15:33.585
And I'm sorry to say this,

15:33.610 --> 15:36.365
but Linda Price has canceled
this year's calendar shoot.

15:36.453 --> 15:37.833
- What?!
- What? No!

15:37.858 --> 15:39.724
- Come on, Chief!
- It's off.

15:40.050 --> 15:41.874
- Are you kidding me?!
- Terrible news, guys.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.657
- Come on!
- For all of us.

15:43.682 --> 15:45.263
- Come on!
- Come on, Chief.

15:45.288 --> 15:46.620
- Chief!
- Man!

15:53.516 --> 15:55.431
- You!
- I tried to stop him, Miss Price,

15:55.456 --> 15:57.568
but... he was too slippery.

15:57.932 --> 16:00.532
That's okay. You seem hot and bothered.

16:00.557 --> 16:02.007
- I am.
- And oily.

16:02.032 --> 16:03.748
- Yeah, I am.
- How can I help?

16:03.916 --> 16:07.093
You can start by taking that
stick out of your badonkadonk!

16:07.323 --> 16:09.827
Look. I know times are changing, okay?

16:09.852 --> 16:12.862
But my grandfather Luigi Penisi

16:12.931 --> 16:17.024
appeared in the 1953
Tacoma FD Beefcake Calendar

16:17.061 --> 16:19.654
using a suggestively placed
sausage to help a woman

16:19.687 --> 16:21.713
in a bikini climb down
from a burning building.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.714
Now, I'm pretty sure I understand

16:23.739 --> 16:25.391
why you couldn't get
away with that today.

16:25.507 --> 16:28.792
But I will not leave this
office until you explain to me

16:28.918 --> 16:30.665
why we can't have a photo shoot

16:30.690 --> 16:32.857
where we pose with oversize food groups.

16:35.505 --> 16:37.437
- Ugh!
- Wow.

16:37.462 --> 16:39.377
An impressive, dramatic monologue

16:39.402 --> 16:41.554
and delightful display
of physical comedy.

16:41.776 --> 16:43.241
Ohh.

16:43.441 --> 16:45.175
But who said you can't
do the photo shoot?

16:45.350 --> 16:47.750
Uh, I was told that you were the one

16:47.775 --> 16:50.120
who put the kibosh on the calendar.

16:50.145 --> 16:51.145
No.

16:51.391 --> 16:53.994
I've even arranged to put them
up in all the public schools.

16:54.877 --> 16:56.410
Be sure to include cabbage.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.672
I feel like cabbage gets a bad rap.

17:01.908 --> 17:03.113
That means that...

17:04.712 --> 17:07.060
Miss Price, I'm sorry I
got your desk all greasy.

17:07.473 --> 17:10.214
Mm. From now on, I'll
call you "Greasy Penisi."

17:10.929 --> 17:14.576
Yeah, actually that's a racially
insensitive slur nowadays.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.569
Huh. Times really have changed.

17:17.226 --> 17:19.030
So, did you hear the
one about the two peanuts

17:19.055 --> 17:20.530
who got... a-salted?

17:21.617 --> 17:22.704
Shit. No. Wait.

17:23.162 --> 17:25.325
Two peanuts walk into a bar.

17:25.546 --> 17:28.440
One of them gets a-salted, yeah?

17:28.932 --> 17:29.948
I think.

17:30.329 --> 17:32.498
Okay, look. I'm off
my A-game. All right?

17:32.678 --> 17:34.931
I was forced to shave
off my little 'fro today,

17:35.045 --> 17:37.100
but if I can just kind of give you...

17:37.125 --> 17:38.251
Hey.

17:38.526 --> 17:40.370
Come on, boys. Let's get out of here.

17:40.854 --> 17:43.156
Hey. Let's go, buddy. Oops.

17:44.028 --> 17:45.123
Have a nice day.

17:46.549 --> 17:49.989
Hey, Chief. Guess what. I
just spoke to Linda Price.

17:50.183 --> 17:52.690
And she says she didn't
cancel the calendar.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.738
Wh-a-a-at?

17:54.972 --> 17:57.639
In fact, she said she didn't
speak to you at all today.

17:57.919 --> 17:58.940
All right. You know what?

17:59.027 --> 18:01.215
I don't have to answer to
you guys about the decisions

18:01.240 --> 18:03.411
- made in this station.
- I knew it. I knew it.

18:03.436 --> 18:05.103
This calendar thing's a distraction.

18:05.128 --> 18:08.129
You guys are running around like
a bunch of oiled-up peacocks.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.888
Wait. This is about me, isn't it?

18:12.374 --> 18:13.789
You just don't want
to see your little girl

18:13.813 --> 18:15.662
posing provocatively for a calendar?

18:16.302 --> 18:17.640
No, I don't mind that.

18:17.665 --> 18:20.143
I mean, well, I don't want to
see you in a racy photo, but...

18:20.574 --> 18:22.840
You're a grown woman. You
can make your own choices.

18:22.937 --> 18:24.414
Yeah? So what is it then?

18:26.662 --> 18:27.685
You want to know what it is?

18:27.709 --> 18:29.040
Yeah, I want to know what it is.

18:29.065 --> 18:30.065
You want to know?

18:30.090 --> 18:31.883
- Yes, we want to know!
- I just said I want to know what it is.

18:31.907 --> 18:33.651
- Do both of you want to know?!
- We want...

18:33.676 --> 18:35.481
- Tell us what it is!
- What do you think we're doing here?!

18:35.505 --> 18:37.891
It's me, okay? It's me. Look.

18:38.545 --> 18:40.256
I used to be a fit stud.

18:40.562 --> 18:42.282
I was a cover boy!

18:42.441 --> 18:44.363
A virile piece of man meat!

18:45.265 --> 18:47.986
That's June! I look like Toby Keith!

18:49.064 --> 18:50.248
Now what, huh?

18:50.438 --> 18:52.905
Now I'm supposed to be on
some calendar half undressed,

18:52.930 --> 18:55.510
looking like a tired old
sack of whale blubber?!

18:55.659 --> 18:57.956
Dad, don't be ridiculous.

18:58.323 --> 19:00.928
You're still one of the
handsomest guys that I know.

19:01.089 --> 19:04.828
Yes, you're larger, but you
carry it with dignity. You know?

19:04.853 --> 19:08.150
Like Cedric the Entertainer or Meat Loaf

19:08.175 --> 19:11.208
or, um, Steven Seagal.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.265
Yeah, Seagal.

19:13.130 --> 19:15.596
Look, you're still easily
one of the best-looking guys

19:15.621 --> 19:17.058
- at the station.
- Okay, okay,

19:17.083 --> 19:18.860
let's not spread it on too thick here.

19:18.885 --> 19:21.250
Come on, Uncle Eddie! Tell
him how gorgeous he is.

19:21.354 --> 19:23.783
No, I'm not gonna lie to the guy.
He knows what he looks like.

19:23.807 --> 19:25.234
But I will say this, Chief.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.442
The world needs to
celebrate people like you.

19:28.555 --> 19:29.656
Yeah!

19:29.877 --> 19:31.641
People of all shapes and sizes.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.954
This is the perfect opportunity

19:34.182 --> 19:36.364
for you to send a
body-positive message...

19:36.514 --> 19:40.603
something validating to all
those little kids out there

19:40.628 --> 19:44.599
who, like you, resemble a
bowling ball on toothpicks.

19:44.793 --> 19:46.326
Kids with butts

19:46.351 --> 19:48.603
that couldn't possibly
hold up a pair of pants.

19:49.008 --> 19:52.241
Just looking at ass
crack all day long, 24/7.

19:52.266 --> 19:54.066
Hey, thanks, Uncle Eddie.
I'll stop you there.

19:54.224 --> 19:56.452
You know what else? I
know this photo editor,

19:56.477 --> 19:57.852
and she has these apps on her phone,

19:57.876 --> 20:00.076
and she can literally turn
you into the love child

20:00.101 --> 20:03.357
of Russell Wilson and The
Rock in, like, three minutes.

20:03.382 --> 20:05.660
- Really?
- Yeah, you're gonna look amazing!

20:06.141 --> 20:08.261
- Let's do that.
- Yeah, I think that's a better idea.

20:09.282 --> 20:15.054
♪ Mm-mm, mm, mm,
mm-mm, mm, mm ♪

20:16.443 --> 20:17.499
Come on, Andy!

20:18.223 --> 20:20.765
Buddy! Come on, man.

20:21.370 --> 20:23.156
Get into it. It's gonna be a blast.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.861
They've got everything
you want here. Look.

20:25.052 --> 20:26.876
Professional-quality hair in a can.

20:27.512 --> 20:29.552
- Hey! God, man!
- You love this stuff!

20:31.815 --> 20:32.841
Mom?

20:33.371 --> 20:35.125
I wanted to come here
to make sure you're not

20:35.149 --> 20:38.221
participating in
this... disgusting orgy.

20:38.246 --> 20:40.023
Oh. We're having an
orgy after the shoot?

20:40.628 --> 20:42.137
Not sure I like the ratio.

20:42.295 --> 20:43.718
You didn't have to come here.

20:44.413 --> 20:45.991
- Tell her.
- You know what?

20:46.706 --> 20:49.637
I'm not a child anymore. I
can make my own decisions.

20:49.853 --> 20:51.536
And I'm here to support my friends,

20:51.596 --> 20:54.746
show off my ripped glutes,
and promote healthy eating.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.178
I love you, but I'm
gonna do this calendar.

20:59.512 --> 21:00.941
Am I still your little Ka'ponko?

21:02.375 --> 21:04.439
I have no Ka'ponko.

21:05.174 --> 21:08.316
What? Ugh. Did you hear that?

21:08.454 --> 21:10.483
Hey. Hey. It's gonna be okay.

21:10.598 --> 21:12.430
You're our little Ka'ponko.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.176
- Come on. It's gonna be awesome.
- Hey, wait, hey.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.215
Come on.

21:15.460 --> 21:18.247
Okay, who's gonna be the
first one to forever change

21:18.272 --> 21:20.153
the way people look
at beefcake calendars?

21:20.570 --> 21:22.702
Watch and learn, you hairless lap dogs.

21:23.571 --> 21:25.004
- Yeah!
- Yeah, Chief!

21:25.029 --> 21:27.069
- Ohh!
- Perfect!

21:27.094 --> 21:29.493
Ooh, that ain't dolphin-safe, Chief.

21:30.994 --> 21:32.646
Go, Chief. Go, Chief.

21:33.982 --> 21:36.189
- I like mine with cheese!
- Work those buns!

21:36.214 --> 21:39.190
- Flame-broiled muscle.
- Make it ripe! Make it ripe!

21:39.857 --> 21:41.340
Peel it. Peel it.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.269
- Yeah, Lucy!
- Oh, oh!

21:43.773 --> 21:45.849
- Yeah, Cap!
- Ohh!

21:46.621 --> 21:48.439
Yeah, cabbage!

21:48.630 --> 21:50.696
- Hey!
- Hey!

21:50.967 --> 21:52.951
- Yeah, Andy!
- Go ahead!

21:53.617 --> 21:54.994
Have some milk with that cupcake.

21:55.711 --> 21:56.870
- Mmm!
- Yeah!

21:57.220 --> 21:58.286
He's feelin' it!

21:58.666 --> 22:00.753
I told you! I told you!

22:04.959 --> 22:06.442
Look at that Hawaiian flyin'.

22:06.467 --> 22:09.190
- Yeah!
- Put some cream in that thing!

22:09.215 --> 22:10.955
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

22:10.980 --> 22:12.614
- Get a glass of milk!
- Myawani!

22:12.639 --> 22:14.435
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

22:16.018 --> 22:17.018
Mom.

22:17.136 --> 22:20.073
Oh, uh, Ka'ponko. Hey, don't worry.

22:20.098 --> 22:21.504
It's okay. All right?

22:21.529 --> 22:23.475
Standing back there,
watching you look so...

22:23.958 --> 22:28.353
cute and tiny behind that
gigantic cupcake with sprinkles,

22:28.599 --> 22:32.081
it just made me realize that
I was the one being small...

22:32.529 --> 22:35.051
small for not accepting
what made you happy.

22:35.375 --> 22:36.456
Aw.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.274
Ka'ponko. Ohh.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.820
Ugh. You know what?

22:41.092 --> 22:44.359
And if dancing around naked
with food makes you happy...

22:44.384 --> 22:46.075
- Yeah.
- ... it makes me happy.

22:46.307 --> 22:48.719
Aww!

22:48.945 --> 22:50.794
Oh, and I had to make it up to you, too.

22:50.819 --> 22:52.207
So I made you this.

22:53.624 --> 22:55.356
- My new low 'fro!
- Uh-huh.

22:55.634 --> 22:57.052
It's made from sweepings.

22:57.161 --> 22:58.283
It's like a hodgepodge.

22:58.696 --> 23:00.156
- Smells great!
- Ah.

23:00.704 --> 23:02.054
- Oh, right now?
- Oh!

23:03.047 --> 23:05.016
- I got my muff back!
- Ah!

23:08.882 --> 23:11.523
I guess I was thinking
we would be normal-sized

23:11.548 --> 23:13.183
and the food would be huge.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.273
Well, maybe there was a 
miscommunication in the printer.

23:15.297 --> 23:16.963
Oh, no, no. No miscommunication.

23:16.988 --> 23:18.348
This is exactly what I told him to do.

23:18.372 --> 23:20.439
Aw, you look adorable.

23:20.464 --> 23:22.197
Did you see me on May? May.

23:22.222 --> 23:24.232
- Hey. 2,000 copies.
- Wow. Really?

23:24.257 --> 23:26.863
Yep, we printed 2,000 of
these idiotic calendars,

23:26.888 --> 23:27.968
and we only sold 17.

23:28.091 --> 23:29.914
And thanks to Lucy, we
couldn't even tap into

23:29.939 --> 23:32.139
our historically reliable
gay-dude demographic.

23:32.164 --> 23:33.521
- Right. Thanks, Lucy.
- Man.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.572
Even the Tacoma public
schools didn't want it.

23:35.597 --> 23:37.708
- So, what now?
- Well, now you guys find a place

23:37.733 --> 23:40.418
to stash this huge cache
of useless calendars,

23:40.443 --> 23:41.683
and we never speak of it again.

23:43.262 --> 23:46.169
Wait, Chief. H-Hey, fellas!

23:49.888 --> 23:52.235
Fools. Bureaucratic fools!

23:52.260 --> 23:53.308
Hey, hey.

23:54.412 --> 23:56.044
They don't know what they've got there.

23:56.089 --> 23:57.610
Let me buy you a protein shake.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.375
You know. Protein?
