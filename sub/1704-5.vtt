02:18.813 --> 02:21.985
PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

02:22.020 --> 02:24.860
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

02:24.895 --> 02:26.866
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

02:26.901 --> 02:28.304
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

02:28.338 --> 02:30.976
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

02:31.010 --> 02:33.483
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not
stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

02:33.518 --> 02:35.354
REAGAN: <i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

02:35.389 --> 02:36.590
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

02:36.624 --> 02:37.892
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

02:37.927 --> 02:39.730
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

02:39.764 --> 02:41.701
This was an act of terrorism.

02:41.735 --> 02:44.208
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

02:44.242 --> 02:46.613
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

02:46.647 --> 02:47.782
is one of the good old
favorites.

02:47.816 --> 02:50.355
...until something stops him.

02:50.389 --> 02:53.094
CARRIE: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

02:53.128 --> 02:56.735
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

02:58.005 --> 03:00.410
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

03:00.445 --> 03:04.084
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

03:04.118 --> 03:06.322
(speaking Arabic)

03:10.765 --> 03:13.270
SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

03:13.304 --> 03:14.639
Fuck!

03:14.673 --> 03:16.309
CARRIE: <i>I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

03:16.343 --> 03:20.015
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

03:22.187 --> 03:23.422
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

03:23.456 --> 03:25.325
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

03:25.360 --> 03:27.061
CARRIE:
<i>Everyone's not me.</i>

03:36.044 --> 03:39.048
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

03:39.083 --> 03:41.853
Suicide bomber almost blew up
Vice President Walden.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.223
He made a tape.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.262
My name is Nicholas Brody.

03:47.296 --> 03:48.731
So you want to follow Brody?

03:48.765 --> 03:50.534
Surveillance equipment,
a few good men.

03:50.569 --> 03:51.870
And Carrie.

03:51.904 --> 03:53.306
And Carrie.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.941
But I'm sending you a guy.

03:54.976 --> 03:56.076
Peter Quinn.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.246
Brody has a meeting
this morning

03:57.280 --> 03:59.249
at the CIA, and we want
to throw him a jolt.

03:59.283 --> 04:01.051
Which is you.

04:01.086 --> 04:02.421
Are you back here?

04:02.455 --> 04:03.923
Yeah, in a way.

04:03.958 --> 04:06.093
Carrie Mathison was at the CIA.

04:06.128 --> 04:08.096
Renew the relationship.

04:08.131 --> 04:09.499
Could be useful, actually.

04:09.533 --> 04:11.669
I'm sorry for all
you went through.

04:11.704 --> 04:14.273
I mean, fucking ECT?

04:14.308 --> 04:15.608
Where'd you hear that?

04:15.643 --> 04:16.677
Was it terrible?

04:16.711 --> 04:18.379
No.

04:19.982 --> 04:21.317
He made me.

04:21.351 --> 04:23.253
PETER: No way.
He's on his way up to his room.

04:23.287 --> 04:24.622
He's acting totally normal.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.625
We have to go in.
He's on to me.

04:26.659 --> 04:28.661
Your work is done tonight.
Get the fuck back here.

04:32.667 --> 04:35.103
SAUL:
Oh, what is she doing?

04:37.007 --> 04:38.642
It reeks, you know.

04:38.676 --> 04:41.111
You still have your twisted
theories about me, don't you?

04:41.146 --> 04:42.814
Not theories anymore.

04:42.848 --> 04:45.017
Get down, get down now!

04:45.051 --> 04:46.286
You're a disgrace
to your nation,

04:46.320 --> 04:47.521
Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.890
You're a traitor
and a terrorist,

04:48.924 --> 04:50.592
and now it's time
you pay for that.

04:53.163 --> 04:56.301
(heavy door slams)

05:27.702 --> 05:30.070
- David...
- Not a word.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.344
(keypad beeping)

05:38.046 --> 05:39.547
What the hell happened?

05:39.581 --> 05:41.215
I thought this was
a surveillance operation.

05:41.249 --> 05:43.050
It was until Carrie

05:43.084 --> 05:45.552
took it upon herself
to break cover and confront him.

05:45.587 --> 05:47.921
We had no choice
but to move in.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.222
She says Brody made her.

05:49.257 --> 05:50.890
- Did he?
- No.

05:50.925 --> 05:52.625
It's possible. I don't know.
Neither does he.

05:52.659 --> 05:54.260
What I do know is we've got

05:54.294 --> 05:56.229
to get Brody
to tell us what he knows

05:56.263 --> 05:57.630
before Nazir's people
realize he's missing.

05:57.664 --> 05:59.231
I agree.

05:59.265 --> 06:01.600
I figure we got 24 hours, tops.

06:01.634 --> 06:02.734
After that, you have to figure

06:02.768 --> 06:04.903
they go to ground or
pick a new target.

06:04.937 --> 06:07.905
And we lose our best shot at
stopping an attack on America.

06:07.939 --> 06:11.074
So, who goes in there
and talks to him?

06:11.109 --> 06:12.476
Carrie.

06:12.510 --> 06:14.244
Are you shitting me?

06:14.278 --> 06:16.813
She knows Brody better
than anyone here.

06:16.847 --> 06:19.882
She's the only one who knows him
up close and personal.

06:19.917 --> 06:22.384
She is way too emotional,

06:22.418 --> 06:25.153
reckless.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.101
I don't know
what they've told you,

06:42.136 --> 06:44.069
but Brody made me, I swear.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.671
I had no choice.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.439
Peter's going to
take a whack at him.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.808
With all due respect, David,
that's a mistake.

06:50.842 --> 06:52.443
You can go home now.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.347
Let her stay.

06:58.615 --> 07:00.616
She can help.

07:00.651 --> 07:02.785
She's forgotten more
about Brody and Nazir

07:02.819 --> 07:04.453
than we'll ever know.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.091
But, Carrie, this
is Peter's show.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.326
Clear?

07:14.028 --> 07:16.196
I'll run interference
on Brody's office.

07:20.501 --> 07:22.702
(door closes)

07:22.736 --> 07:24.504
I should be in there, Saul.

07:24.538 --> 07:26.539
You're lucky you're
in the building.

07:55.366 --> 07:58.834
You're in the custody of the
Central Intelligence Agency.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.636
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

08:00.670 --> 08:01.904
I'm a United States congressman.

08:01.938 --> 08:03.739
You can't just kidnap me
and shackle me

08:03.773 --> 08:05.540
to the fucking floor.
Actually, we can.

08:05.574 --> 08:07.976
Thanks to you and your
colleagues in congress,

08:08.010 --> 08:11.846
we have fairly broad powers
to detain and interrogate.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.682
Look, I've been
down this road before.

08:14.716 --> 08:16.717
I'm not what Carrie says I am.

08:16.752 --> 08:18.986
Ask David Estes--
he'll tell you.

08:19.021 --> 08:20.688
By Carrie, you mean
Carrie Mathison?

08:20.722 --> 08:22.089
Yes.

08:22.123 --> 08:23.824
And what exactly does
she think you are?

08:23.858 --> 08:25.059
A terrorist.

08:25.093 --> 08:26.360
And you're not?

08:26.394 --> 08:28.762
No, I'm not.

08:28.796 --> 08:31.531
You should know that everything
that you say in here

08:31.566 --> 08:33.732
will be used against
you in your trial.

08:33.768 --> 08:35.202
You should also know

08:35.236 --> 08:37.236
that you are facing a
possible death sentence.

08:37.270 --> 08:39.839
- I want a lawyer.
- Well, life is full of disappointments.

08:39.873 --> 08:42.708
I want a fucking lawyer!

08:42.743 --> 08:46.045
(Brody breathing heavily)

08:46.080 --> 08:47.580
After your capture in 2003,

08:47.614 --> 08:50.616
you were subjected to
a period of five years

08:50.650 --> 08:52.551
of profound and
constant torture.

08:52.585 --> 08:55.186
(sighs) It says here,

08:55.221 --> 08:57.856
(clears throat)
"Brutally beaten, electricity,

08:57.890 --> 09:00.024
isolation and worse."

09:00.058 --> 09:02.726
Am I getting things
right so far?

09:02.760 --> 09:05.195
It is important
that we're accurate.

09:05.229 --> 09:07.763
(panting) Hmm?

09:11.467 --> 09:12.934
Hmm.

09:12.968 --> 09:17.071
Why did the torture stop?

09:17.105 --> 09:20.040
I'm completely
off the grid here, aren't I?

09:20.074 --> 09:22.208
Why did the torture stop?

09:23.744 --> 09:26.045
I don't know.

09:26.079 --> 09:28.480
Who was Issa?

09:32.451 --> 09:34.285
Issa? Issa was one of my guards.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.787
I told Carrie that already.

09:35.821 --> 09:37.888
Was he the reason
the torture stopped?

09:37.923 --> 09:40.291
I have no idea.

09:40.325 --> 09:42.226
Were you aware

09:42.260 --> 09:45.896
that Abu Nazir's youngest
son was also named Issa?

09:45.930 --> 09:48.798
I didn't know that, no.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.800
You've never met the boy?

09:50.835 --> 09:53.336
No.

09:55.839 --> 09:59.241
Were you aware that he
was killed at his madrassa

09:59.276 --> 10:01.076
during an American
drone strike?

10:01.111 --> 10:03.611
I wasn't, no.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.613
Hmm.

10:08.717 --> 10:12.486
He's setting the table
with Brody's lies.

10:13.688 --> 10:15.022
He's good.

10:15.056 --> 10:16.656
PETER:
In your debrief, you indicate

10:16.691 --> 10:19.292
that you have never
met Abu Nazir.

10:19.326 --> 10:22.695
Yet Carrie Mathison's addendum
to your file contradicts that.

10:22.730 --> 10:23.929
Well, she's lying.

10:23.964 --> 10:25.030
Why would she do that?

10:25.065 --> 10:27.232
Because she's
out of her fucking mind.

10:29.335 --> 10:30.702
Because she's obsessed with me.

10:30.736 --> 10:33.004
PETER:
Is it also a lie that

10:33.039 --> 10:35.173
while in captivity,
you converted to Islam?

10:35.207 --> 10:36.607
Yes.

10:36.642 --> 10:38.442
Do you have any idea why,

10:38.477 --> 10:39.877
on the morning of December 17,

10:39.911 --> 10:41.979
Thomas Walker shot and
killed Elizabeth Gaines?

10:42.013 --> 10:43.547
I assume it was because

10:43.581 --> 10:45.315
he was trying to kill
the vice president.

10:45.349 --> 10:46.516
- So he missed?
- Apparently.

10:46.550 --> 10:47.817
The best shot in your unit?

10:47.851 --> 10:49.151
It happens.

10:49.186 --> 10:50.719
You want to hear my theory?

10:50.753 --> 10:53.854
My theory is Elizabeth
Gaines was killed

10:53.889 --> 10:55.856
in order to instigate
Secret Service protocols,

10:55.890 --> 10:57.024
which it did.

10:57.058 --> 10:58.825
Everybody was herded together

10:58.860 --> 11:00.693
into the State
Department panic room

11:00.728 --> 11:02.628
without security checks.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.463
27 of our best and brightest,

11:04.498 --> 11:06.398
all crowded on in
there with you,

11:06.432 --> 11:08.533
who was wearing a bomb.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.002
A...

11:10.036 --> 11:12.337
Where the fuck
would I get a bomb?

11:12.371 --> 11:14.839
So you weren't wearing a bomb?

11:14.874 --> 11:16.007
No.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.842
You didn't know Abu Nazir's son?

11:17.876 --> 11:19.143
No.

11:19.177 --> 11:20.844
And you did not conspire

11:20.879 --> 11:22.512
to assassinate the
vice president?

11:24.015 --> 11:26.816
Of course I didn't.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.922
I've got something
I'd like you to watch.

11:33.957 --> 11:35.991
(papers rustling)

11:53.106 --> 11:55.707
My name is Nicholas Brody,

11:55.741 --> 11:59.877
and I'm a sergeant in
the United States Marine Corps.

11:59.911 --> 12:03.414
I have a wife

12:03.448 --> 12:06.049
and two kids,

12:06.084 --> 12:09.485
who I love.

12:09.519 --> 12:11.921
I'll be right back.

12:14.490 --> 12:16.557
By the time you watch this,

12:16.592 --> 12:19.460
you'll have read
a lot of things about me,

12:19.494 --> 12:22.162
about what I've done.

12:22.196 --> 12:25.799
That's why I wanted
to explain myself.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.567
(door closes)

12:27.601 --> 12:30.069
So that you'll know the truth.

12:30.103 --> 12:32.471
On May 19, 2003,

12:32.505 --> 12:34.773
as part
of a two-man sniper team

12:34.807 --> 12:36.942
serving
in Operation Iraqi Freedom...

12:36.976 --> 12:40.077
Let him suck on that.

12:40.112 --> 12:42.046
Neatly done.

12:45.317 --> 12:48.785
When the tape ends,
we'll let him stew for a while.

12:48.820 --> 12:50.854
No sleep.

12:50.888 --> 12:53.589
...where I was held captive

12:53.624 --> 12:57.493
for more than eight years.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.767
What hotel?

13:05.802 --> 13:07.769
I'm not sure.

13:07.804 --> 13:10.138
For how long?

13:11.707 --> 13:13.642
I'm not sure.

13:13.676 --> 13:15.677
Are you guys getting a divorce?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.846
No, we're...

13:17.880 --> 13:21.549
we're just giving each other
some breathing room.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.950
What does that mean?

13:22.985 --> 13:24.318
It means we're trying

13:24.352 --> 13:26.687
very hard to work things out.

13:26.721 --> 13:28.321
Work what out?

13:29.657 --> 13:32.024
Our problems.

13:36.429 --> 13:38.597
(sighs)

13:47.171 --> 13:49.137
I'll see you
guys at 5:00.

13:49.172 --> 13:50.772
It's pizza night.

13:56.343 --> 13:58.377
Is Dad really coming back?

13:58.411 --> 14:01.013
Yeah, he's coming back.

14:01.047 --> 14:02.914
How do you know?

14:02.949 --> 14:05.116
Because I know, Chris.

14:12.089 --> 14:13.823
Hey.

14:13.857 --> 14:15.691
Hi.

14:17.293 --> 14:20.895
Are you okay?

14:26.101 --> 14:28.168
Who broke his heart?

14:28.202 --> 14:30.403
My mother.

14:30.438 --> 14:32.371
What'd she do?
Throw away his Xbox?

14:32.405 --> 14:35.707
No, she, uh, threw our father
out of the house.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.942
Oh.

14:37.976 --> 14:39.443
My mother does
that once a month.

14:39.477 --> 14:41.344
My dad sleeps in the
guest wing for a week,

14:41.379 --> 14:43.246
she swears she's done
with him for good,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.181
next thing I know,

14:45.215 --> 14:47.083
they're drinking martinis and
listening to <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

14:47.117 --> 14:48.717
(chuckles)

14:48.752 --> 14:51.020
My therapist says it's
pretty common, but...

14:51.054 --> 14:53.022
You have a therapist?

14:53.056 --> 14:55.224
(chuckles) I had a therapist.

14:55.258 --> 14:57.259
Once.

15:00.263 --> 15:02.764
So, um,

15:02.798 --> 15:05.533
I talked to Xander.

15:05.567 --> 15:07.701
Home guy?

15:07.735 --> 15:09.569
Yeah, well,

15:09.603 --> 15:12.705
the former home guy.

15:12.740 --> 15:15.407
Oh.

15:15.442 --> 15:17.209
Take me out tonight?

15:17.244 --> 15:18.310
Okay.

15:18.345 --> 15:19.645
How about a movie?

15:19.679 --> 15:21.413
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:21.447 --> 15:23.715
<i>Once Upon a Time in America</i>
is playing at Dupont Circle.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.584
Sergio Leone.

15:25.618 --> 15:28.720
I have absolutely no
idea who that is.

15:28.754 --> 15:30.054
(chuckles)

15:30.088 --> 15:31.989
He's a great Italian filmmaker

15:32.023 --> 15:34.624
who specializes
in wide-screen agony.

15:39.797 --> 15:41.630
GREG: What do you mean, he's
not answering his phone?

15:41.665 --> 15:43.232
He has to answer his phone;
he's a congressman.

15:43.266 --> 15:44.466
He can't just disappear.

15:44.501 --> 15:46.601
What about his wife?

15:46.636 --> 15:48.770
She's not answering, either?

15:48.804 --> 15:50.138
Jesus.

15:50.172 --> 15:51.972
Greg Merriles, did I
pronounce that right?

15:52.007 --> 15:53.340
- Yes.
- My name is David Estes.

15:53.374 --> 15:55.141
I work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

15:55.176 --> 15:57.243
I know who you are, sir.

15:57.278 --> 15:59.679
Congressman Brody is
helping us out on a matter

15:59.713 --> 16:01.113
of national security.

16:01.147 --> 16:02.848
He is?

16:02.882 --> 16:04.482
It's imperative that no one,
including his family,

16:04.517 --> 16:05.984
questions his absence.

16:06.018 --> 16:07.852
How long will he be helping you?

16:07.887 --> 16:09.921
- A few days.
- A few days?

16:09.955 --> 16:11.855
That's going to be tricky.
His-his schedule's jam-packed.

16:11.890 --> 16:13.623
Committee meetings,
uh, interviews galore.

16:13.658 --> 16:15.925
He's at the vice president's
beck and call.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.095
I think the safest thing would
be to say that he has the flu.

16:19.129 --> 16:20.796
There's a nasty strain
going around right now.

16:20.830 --> 16:23.298
Tell anybody who asks
he's staying at the Ashford.

16:23.332 --> 16:25.466
Why would he be staying
at the Ashford?

16:25.501 --> 16:28.102
He and his wife are in
the middle of a conjugal spat.

16:28.136 --> 16:29.470
That's actually the truth.

16:29.504 --> 16:31.004
It is? Huh.

16:31.039 --> 16:32.506
Why don't I know that?

16:32.540 --> 16:34.941
Just reassure her
that he's fine,

16:34.976 --> 16:37.210
that his doctor has seen him
and that all will be well.

16:37.244 --> 16:39.545
Call me if there's a problem.

16:56.726 --> 16:59.127
Hey, this is Nicholas Brody.

16:59.161 --> 17:00.494
Please leave a message.

17:00.528 --> 17:01.895
(beep)

17:01.930 --> 17:04.164
Brody, it's me.

17:04.198 --> 17:06.565
Call me back.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.884
(door opening)

17:27.919 --> 17:30.520
Listen to this.

17:30.554 --> 17:32.922
JESSICA:
Brody, it's me again.

17:32.956 --> 17:34.924
Please call me back.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.425
The kids are freaked.

17:36.459 --> 17:38.093
I'm freaked, to be honest.

17:38.128 --> 17:39.661
We need to talk.

17:39.695 --> 17:42.197
She's called three times.

17:51.107 --> 17:53.474
So, what do you
say we start over?

17:56.378 --> 17:58.346
Who was Issa?

17:58.380 --> 17:59.747
Abu Nazir's son.

17:59.782 --> 18:01.048
Not your guard?

18:01.083 --> 18:03.083
- No.
- In fact, you knew Issa.

18:03.118 --> 18:05.185
He was your student.
You taught him English.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.887
Yes.

18:06.921 --> 18:09.556
And you came to love him
as if he were your own son.

18:09.590 --> 18:12.458
Yes, I did.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.459
PETER:
He was killed in a drone strike

18:14.494 --> 18:17.229
ordered by the highest levels
of government.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.364
(sighs)

18:19.398 --> 18:21.032
He was killed in a drone strike

18:21.066 --> 18:24.035
ordered by the vice president
of the United States.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.903
Who you called a war criminal.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.572
- Because he is.
- Truth is,

18:28.607 --> 18:31.542
you returned from captivity
in Iraq intent on killing him.

18:31.576 --> 18:33.043
Yes.

18:33.078 --> 18:36.213
Which is why,
on the morning of December 17,

18:36.248 --> 18:38.315
wearing a suicide vest,

18:38.350 --> 18:40.284
you conspired to get yourself
next to the vice president

18:40.318 --> 18:41.652
in the State Department
panic room.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.087
No.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.189
What do you mean, no?

18:47.525 --> 18:49.392
I wasn't wearing a vest.

18:49.427 --> 18:51.928
I made a tape. That's all.

18:51.962 --> 18:54.230
You're lying to me again.

18:56.633 --> 18:59.101
BRODY:
I was fucked-up.

18:59.135 --> 19:01.136
I was angry.

19:01.170 --> 19:04.406
But ask yourself,
what really happened?

19:05.875 --> 19:07.742
Nothing.

19:07.776 --> 19:09.743
Nothing?

19:09.778 --> 19:11.945
Tell that to Elizabeth Gaines

19:11.980 --> 19:14.414
and the two Secret Service
agents who lost their lives

19:14.448 --> 19:16.415
on the steps
of the State Department.

19:16.450 --> 19:19.619
I had nothing to do with that.

19:19.653 --> 19:21.921
Do you really expect anyone
to believe that

19:21.955 --> 19:23.355
after watching this?

19:23.390 --> 19:25.691
Believe what you want.

19:27.226 --> 19:29.594
No bomb went off.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.029
I killed no one.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.333
You've got nothing on me.

19:38.837 --> 19:42.072
No real evidence at all.

19:46.477 --> 19:47.944
Do you really want to do this?

19:47.979 --> 19:50.347
What?

19:54.818 --> 19:57.186
This.

19:57.220 --> 19:59.788
Play games.

19:59.822 --> 20:03.324
Because I can play, too.

20:05.093 --> 20:07.561
What do you think Jessica
will say

20:07.595 --> 20:09.529
when I show her your confession?

20:09.564 --> 20:12.665
I think she'll be glad
I didn't go through with it.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.668
I think she'll understand

20:15.702 --> 20:17.469
that I was unhinged

20:17.504 --> 20:19.405
by everything
that's been done to me,

20:19.439 --> 20:22.373
everything I've been through.

20:22.407 --> 20:26.176
She's a very
understanding woman.

20:26.211 --> 20:29.079
And... Dana?

20:29.113 --> 20:32.815
Is she as understanding?

20:35.619 --> 20:37.686
What about Chris?

20:37.721 --> 20:39.888
How old is he now?

20:39.923 --> 20:43.325
12?

20:43.360 --> 20:46.729
What do you think the rest
of their lives will look like?

20:48.464 --> 20:51.900
My dad, the jihadist murderer.

20:54.403 --> 20:56.738
I'll take my chances.

20:58.274 --> 21:00.375
Go ahead and show them.

21:12.653 --> 21:16.055
We know Abu Nazir
is going to hit us

21:16.089 --> 21:17.923
in retaliation
for Israel's bombing

21:17.957 --> 21:19.891
of Iranian nuclear sites.

21:19.926 --> 21:22.727
You were part of his American
terrorist cell.

21:22.761 --> 21:25.395
No, I wasn't.

21:25.430 --> 21:28.064
When is the strike
going to occur?

21:28.099 --> 21:30.933
I don't know.

21:30.967 --> 21:32.868
What's the target?

21:32.902 --> 21:35.237
(sighs)

21:35.271 --> 21:37.639
I don't know.

21:42.110 --> 21:45.512
What... is the target?

21:46.747 --> 21:48.748
I don't know.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.888
(screaming) That jog your
memory, you fucking asshole?

21:56.923 --> 21:59.457
Jesus fucking Christ!

21:59.491 --> 22:00.758
When's the attack?! (gasps)

22:00.792 --> 22:02.126
Talk, you motherfucker!

22:02.160 --> 22:04.495
You will talk to me,
Brody, goddamn it.

22:04.529 --> 22:05.896
Get the fuck off of me!

22:05.930 --> 22:07.297
What the fuck
is the matter with you?!

22:07.331 --> 22:09.666
This is my interrogation!

22:09.700 --> 22:11.234
Get him out of here.

22:11.268 --> 22:15.805
Brody, I will fuck you.
Fuck you!

22:15.839 --> 22:19.308
(panting)

22:19.342 --> 22:21.410
- We should go.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

22:21.444 --> 22:24.279
(gasps, yells)

22:24.313 --> 22:26.514
(Brody gasps, Carrie sighs)

22:26.548 --> 22:28.916
(panting)

22:34.521 --> 22:36.655
I can do this, Saul.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.190
It's my turn.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.726
(Brody groans)

22:46.664 --> 22:49.032
(panting)

23:07.347 --> 23:09.214
I'm sure he isn't here.

23:09.249 --> 23:10.816
He hasn't been around
since yesterday.

23:10.850 --> 23:13.285
- I just want to see for myself.
- Of course.

23:42.374 --> 23:44.575
Yesterday.

23:45.777 --> 23:48.579
Hi, Betsy. Is Greg there?

23:48.614 --> 23:50.514
(phone rings) What's up?

23:50.549 --> 23:53.350
I'm at the Ashford.
No Brody, no flu.

23:53.385 --> 23:56.052
I even brought him
chicken noodle soup.

23:56.087 --> 23:58.388
Ugh. Not there? Really?
Are you sure?

23:58.422 --> 24:01.290
Yeah, I'm sure.
So where is he?

24:01.325 --> 24:03.192
Well, don't worry.
I'll find him.

24:03.227 --> 24:06.395
You do that,
and you tell him to call me.

24:13.403 --> 24:15.704
As you can see here,
here and here,

24:15.739 --> 24:17.773
Israeli jets weren't able

24:17.807 --> 24:20.275
to penetrate the deeper bunkers.
(cell phone buzzing)

24:20.309 --> 24:22.277
The Iranians hardened the roof

24:22.311 --> 24:24.679
with reinforced concrete,
and then they covered it with...

24:24.713 --> 24:26.080
Estes.

24:26.114 --> 24:27.081
She knows.

24:27.115 --> 24:28.615
Who is this?

24:28.650 --> 24:30.216
Greg Merriles.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.685
Jessica Brody is all over my ass
looking for her husband.

24:32.719 --> 24:34.052
She knows I'm bullshitting her.

24:34.087 --> 24:36.554
Uh, we need a little more time.

24:36.588 --> 24:39.356
Let me speak to Brody.

24:39.391 --> 24:40.791
He's busy right now.

24:40.825 --> 24:41.958
I'll wait.

24:41.993 --> 24:44.360
I'll have him call you back.

24:44.394 --> 24:47.062
(phone beeps off)

24:50.599 --> 24:52.566
Fuck.

25:00.073 --> 25:02.474
(door opens and closes)

25:26.497 --> 25:28.865
You broke my heart, you know.

25:33.304 --> 25:35.738
Was that easy for you?

25:35.773 --> 25:37.507
Was that fun?

25:37.541 --> 25:40.209
Because of you,

25:40.244 --> 25:43.145
I questioned my own sanity.

25:43.180 --> 25:46.248
I had myself committed
to a mental institution.

25:47.851 --> 25:50.618
I lost my job, too.

25:52.088 --> 25:54.522
I lost my place in the world.

25:56.858 --> 25:58.425
I lost everything.

25:58.460 --> 26:00.827
I just told Estes the truth.

26:00.861 --> 26:03.029
You were harassing my family.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.830
The truth? Bullshit.

26:04.865 --> 26:07.566
You came this close to blowing
him into a million pieces.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.934
Did you tell him that?

26:08.968 --> 26:11.069
I didn't wear a bomb.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.538
(panting)

26:17.542 --> 26:20.176
Did you even think about me
when you went to Estes?

26:20.211 --> 26:23.580
Tell me you at least felt a...

26:23.614 --> 26:25.081
a pang of regret,

26:25.115 --> 26:27.784
a teeny little sliver of guilt.

26:36.393 --> 26:38.794
You said before that
I'm obsessed with you.

26:41.897 --> 26:44.365
You really think that?

26:44.399 --> 26:46.367
Yeah, I do.

26:48.670 --> 26:50.471
So it's a one-way street?

26:50.505 --> 26:52.806
You have no feelings for me?

26:56.077 --> 26:59.446
Go ahead. I'm a big girl.
I can take it.

27:02.383 --> 27:05.218
Come on, Brody.

27:05.252 --> 27:09.088
Look me in the eye and
tell me you felt nothing

27:09.122 --> 27:11.189
up in that cabin.

27:14.426 --> 27:16.794
I'm sorry I hurt you.

27:16.829 --> 27:19.196
(laughs)

27:21.332 --> 27:23.533
"Hurt" doesn't quite cover it.

27:26.036 --> 27:28.437
So did you? Did you...

27:28.471 --> 27:30.472
did you feel anything?

27:30.506 --> 27:32.940
Oh, for Christ's sake, Carrie,
we were playing each other.

27:32.975 --> 27:34.375
No, I wasn't.

27:34.409 --> 27:35.976
Not the whole time, anyway.

27:36.011 --> 27:39.279
I-I remember thinking
I was exactly where I belonged.

27:41.782 --> 27:45.184
I know what you're doing.

27:45.218 --> 27:47.819
And it's not going to work.

27:53.625 --> 27:56.527
I'm just happy
to be talking to you again.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.767
Are you thirsty?

28:04.802 --> 28:06.602
(sighs)

28:06.636 --> 28:09.004
Water, please?

28:10.940 --> 28:13.674
What you did with the knife,

28:13.709 --> 28:15.810
losing your temper--

28:15.844 --> 28:18.112
that was all theater?

28:18.146 --> 28:20.313
Wasn't it?

28:20.348 --> 28:24.017
Every good cop needs a bad cop.

28:51.441 --> 28:53.842
(sighs)

28:58.248 --> 29:00.682
(sighs)

29:07.922 --> 29:11.023
What the fuck is she doing?

29:15.695 --> 29:17.395
Just listen.

29:32.442 --> 29:35.377
(whispers):
Alone at last.

29:40.249 --> 29:42.917
CARRIE:
Here, let me get these off you.

29:45.053 --> 29:47.421
(Brody sighs)

29:49.290 --> 29:51.658
(sighs)

30:03.669 --> 30:06.037
(long sigh)

30:12.643 --> 30:15.045
Can I ask you something?

30:15.079 --> 30:16.579
I have a choice?

30:16.614 --> 30:18.547
You said up at the cabin that

30:18.582 --> 30:20.049
you didn't have
anyone to talk to.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.750
Did you... did you
ever find anybody?

30:21.784 --> 30:23.952
A friend?

30:23.987 --> 30:25.720
A therapist?

30:25.754 --> 30:26.954
No.

30:28.623 --> 30:31.258
You never went back to that
support group, did you?

30:31.292 --> 30:33.293
- No.
- Why?

30:36.196 --> 30:38.231
I don't know.

30:38.265 --> 30:40.867
(long sigh)

30:42.936 --> 30:46.137
People always ask
me about the war.

30:46.171 --> 30:48.005
You know...

30:48.040 --> 30:50.240
was it as bad as everyone says?

30:50.275 --> 30:52.476
I-I never know
what to tell them.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.810
(laughs) "My interpreter

30:54.845 --> 30:57.512
was burned alive and
then hung from a bridge"?

31:05.119 --> 31:07.487
No one survives intact.

31:07.521 --> 31:10.256
No.

31:10.290 --> 31:12.158
Do you still have nightmares?

31:16.162 --> 31:19.331
(sighs) Sometimes I
shake uncontrollably

31:19.365 --> 31:21.533
for no reason at all.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.104
So what do you say...

31:26.138 --> 31:28.673
when people ask you what
it was like over there?

31:28.707 --> 31:31.542
As little as possible.

31:31.577 --> 31:33.811
But if they insist?

31:35.848 --> 31:38.783
I lie.

31:38.817 --> 31:41.986
Tell them stories
they want to hear.

31:43.054 --> 31:46.656
It's the lies that undo us.

31:46.690 --> 31:50.759
It's the lies we think
we need to survive.

31:50.793 --> 31:54.228
When was the last time
you told the truth?

31:56.030 --> 31:57.931
About five minutes ago

31:57.965 --> 31:59.699
when I said I didn't
wear a bomb.

32:03.236 --> 32:05.971
You never wore a bomb?

32:06.005 --> 32:08.540
No.

32:09.942 --> 32:12.043
But you did make
a suicide tape.

32:12.077 --> 32:14.144
Who did you give it to?

32:14.179 --> 32:16.146
I didn't give it to anyone.

32:16.181 --> 32:18.382
I threw it in the trash.

32:18.416 --> 32:22.686
And yet it wound up in Beirut in
a Hezbollah commander's house?

32:24.555 --> 32:27.357
See? You're
drowning in lies.

32:29.060 --> 32:31.528
I'm surprised you can even
keep them straight anymore.

32:31.562 --> 32:33.363
Walden lied to the
whole fucking world

32:33.397 --> 32:35.665
- about the drone strike!
- Yes, he did.

32:35.699 --> 32:37.534
But you're not
like him, are you?

32:37.568 --> 32:40.270
- You're not a monster.
- No.

32:40.304 --> 32:43.106
Are you sure you're
not a monster, Brody?

32:46.610 --> 32:49.011
I'm sure.

32:50.447 --> 32:53.049
But Abu Nazir is.

32:53.083 --> 32:56.918
His pattern is to target
innocent civilians

32:56.953 --> 32:59.587
and inflict mass casualties.

32:59.622 --> 33:02.857
Kenya, 1998, a
busy marketplace.

33:02.891 --> 33:06.261
Madrid, 2004, a packed
commuter train.

33:06.295 --> 33:09.697
Last spring, a department
store in Amsterdam.

33:09.731 --> 33:12.733
He doesn't strike soldiers

33:12.767 --> 33:15.236
and high-ranking
murderers like Walden.

33:15.270 --> 33:17.804
He kills wives...

33:17.839 --> 33:20.841
and children.

33:22.110 --> 33:24.044
Danas and...

33:24.078 --> 33:26.646
Chrises and Jessicas.

33:31.785 --> 33:35.253
I know that you think
that he was kind to you,

33:35.287 --> 33:38.788
that he saved you,
but the truth is...

33:38.823 --> 33:42.758
he systematically pulled
you apart, Brody...

33:42.793 --> 33:45.427
piece by piece

33:45.461 --> 33:49.097
until there was
nothing left but pain.

33:50.299 --> 33:53.167
And then he relieved the pain

33:53.202 --> 33:57.572
and he put you back together
again as someone else.

34:04.278 --> 34:07.780
He gave you a boy to love,

34:07.815 --> 34:10.983
and then that other
monster, Walden,

34:11.016 --> 34:13.818
took that boy away.

34:16.387 --> 34:20.723
Between the two of them,
they made your life a misery.

34:26.795 --> 34:29.864
Wouldn't it be a
relief to stop lying?

34:36.036 --> 34:38.004
For instance, if
I stopped lying,

34:38.039 --> 34:39.806
I could say to you, "Brody...

34:39.840 --> 34:42.042
I want you to leave
your wife and children

34:42.076 --> 34:44.844
and be with me."

34:47.714 --> 34:50.516
(laughs)

34:50.550 --> 34:52.952
There, I said it.

34:52.985 --> 34:55.387
I'm still alive.

34:58.525 --> 35:01.127
It feels good.

35:03.363 --> 35:05.498
Try it.

35:10.536 --> 35:14.205
You're a good man, Brody.

35:19.077 --> 35:21.411
You're a good man...

35:23.414 --> 35:27.283
...because you didn't explode
the vest you were wearing.

35:28.351 --> 35:30.152
Right?

35:40.696 --> 35:43.430
(whispers):
I wasn't wearing a vest.

35:46.634 --> 35:50.403
You decided not to
kill those people.

35:52.706 --> 35:55.608
You decided to let Walden live.

35:57.377 --> 35:59.778
Even Walden.

36:05.417 --> 36:06.950
Dana called you, didn't she?

36:08.920 --> 36:11.955
CARRIE: While you were there
in the panic room with Walden.

36:11.989 --> 36:14.056
She used my cell.

36:14.091 --> 36:16.258
What did she say?

36:20.396 --> 36:23.064
She asked me to come home.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.701
I said I would.

36:28.303 --> 36:30.471
And I did.

36:30.505 --> 36:34.441
It was hearing Dana's voice that
changed your mind, wasn't it?

36:36.744 --> 36:38.244
(pants)

36:39.780 --> 36:43.082
She asked you to come
home, and you did.

36:46.519 --> 36:48.620
Why?

36:51.690 --> 36:54.258
Maybe because...

36:55.760 --> 36:58.128
Maybe because you
suddenly understood

36:58.162 --> 37:00.663
that killing yourself
and ruining Dana's life

37:00.698 --> 37:02.865
wouldn't bring Issa back.

37:05.935 --> 37:07.802
Maybe because you knew then

37:07.837 --> 37:10.338
how much you loved
your own child.

37:14.608 --> 37:18.143
Maybe because you were
just sick of death.

37:26.951 --> 37:29.452
That's the Brody
I'm talking to.

37:31.288 --> 37:33.756
That's the Brody that
knows the difference

37:33.790 --> 37:36.725
between warfare and terrorism.

37:38.361 --> 37:42.531
That's the Brody I met
up in that cabin.

37:55.843 --> 37:59.178
That's the Brody
I fell in love with.

38:14.193 --> 38:17.528
What is Abu Nazir's plan?

38:21.099 --> 38:23.434
I don't know.

38:26.905 --> 38:30.008
But there is a plan, right?

38:32.944 --> 38:35.079
To attack America?

38:51.894 --> 38:53.561
Yes.

39:05.439 --> 39:08.106
Who does know the plan?

39:12.945 --> 39:16.014
Uh, Roya Hammad, maybe.
I'm not sure.

39:16.048 --> 39:17.582
Roya Hammad?

39:19.885 --> 39:23.088
Who gave you the suicide vest?

39:25.658 --> 39:29.093
A tailor from Gettysburg
in Pennsylvania.

39:29.128 --> 39:31.029
What's his name?

39:33.666 --> 39:36.034
Bassel something.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.769
Is there anyone else
in Nazir's network

39:37.804 --> 39:39.405
that you've had contact with?

39:39.439 --> 39:42.274
There was Afzal Hamid.

39:44.444 --> 39:48.281
Al Zahrani, the...
Saudi attaché.

39:51.452 --> 39:54.488
(sighs) And Tom Walker.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.590
All dead.

39:59.694 --> 40:02.129
(whispers):
All dead.

40:10.005 --> 40:11.605
(exhales)

40:17.845 --> 40:20.313
(long exhale)

40:24.617 --> 40:27.519
(door opens)

40:37.163 --> 40:39.698
We need you to call your wife.

40:42.635 --> 40:44.870
Reassure her that you're okay.

40:44.905 --> 40:47.973
That you'll be home...

40:48.007 --> 40:50.976
later tonight.

41:03.489 --> 41:06.358
When's Finn picking you up?

41:06.392 --> 41:07.826
Soon.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.628
Are you excited?

41:09.662 --> 41:11.963
It's just a date, Mom.

41:11.997 --> 41:14.799
(phone ringing)

41:20.039 --> 41:21.640
Hello?

41:21.674 --> 41:23.341
Hey, it's me.

41:23.376 --> 41:25.076
Brody.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.648
Just checking in.

41:29.682 --> 41:31.383
How are you?

41:31.417 --> 41:32.885
Where have you been?

41:32.919 --> 41:35.821
Looking for some answers.

41:37.390 --> 41:39.924
Did you find any?

41:39.958 --> 41:42.093
Yeah, I think so.

41:45.764 --> 41:47.965
How are the kids?

41:51.270 --> 41:53.605
They miss their father.

41:55.909 --> 41:57.843
We need to talk, Brody.

41:57.877 --> 41:59.912
I'll come by the house.

41:59.946 --> 42:01.514
When?

42:01.548 --> 42:02.748
Tonight.

42:04.751 --> 42:07.086
Jess, don't worry.

42:07.120 --> 42:10.156
We're going to be fine.

42:17.665 --> 42:18.832
(beep)

42:20.602 --> 42:22.703
Your father's coming home.

42:22.738 --> 42:24.205
Sure he is.

42:35.182 --> 42:36.649
SAUL:
Okay.

42:42.189 --> 42:43.589
Easy.

42:43.623 --> 42:46.726
(panting)

42:46.760 --> 42:48.361
(groans)

42:52.133 --> 42:54.301
(panting)

43:00.309 --> 43:02.677
(insects chittering, chirping)

43:15.124 --> 43:17.325
Well, you look nice.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.527
I combed my hair.

43:19.562 --> 43:21.863
Well, then you look beautiful.

43:29.137 --> 43:31.839
Did you tell Xander
you're seeing Finn?

43:31.873 --> 43:34.508
Yeah, I-I told him.

43:34.542 --> 43:37.777
I figured it would just be
too creepy otherwise.

43:37.812 --> 43:39.879
Or just be wrong otherwise.

43:39.913 --> 43:41.848
I'm proud of you.

43:44.918 --> 43:47.153
It is kind of weird, though.

43:47.187 --> 43:50.122
I mean, me dating
the boss's son.

43:50.157 --> 43:52.558
It's not weird at all.

43:52.592 --> 43:56.327
Anyway, Vice President Walden
isn't Dad's boss exactly.

43:56.362 --> 43:58.496
They're colleagues.

43:58.531 --> 44:00.064
Mmm.

44:04.937 --> 44:07.639
I'm sorry about
all the confusion.

44:07.673 --> 44:11.075
I know your dad and I are
supposed to be the grown-ups.

44:11.109 --> 44:14.311
It's... whatever.

44:23.955 --> 44:26.589
Dad changed over there.

44:29.226 --> 44:31.827
They did something to him.

44:31.861 --> 44:34.396
They did.

44:39.602 --> 44:42.503
(car approaching)

44:48.642 --> 44:49.942
There he is.

44:53.213 --> 44:55.080
Hi, Mrs. Brody.

44:55.115 --> 44:57.616
Hi, Finn.

44:57.650 --> 44:59.451
Get her back safe and sound.

44:59.485 --> 45:01.419
Yes, ma'am.

45:33.755 --> 45:35.556
(door locks)

45:44.200 --> 45:45.267
(gasps)

45:49.539 --> 45:52.007
Brody, we need
to go over your options.

46:02.518 --> 46:04.419
Here's what you're facing...

46:04.453 --> 46:08.656
a trial with all
the attendant publicity,

46:08.691 --> 46:10.791
followed by
a long prison sentence.

46:10.826 --> 46:13.928
You'll bring dishonor
and shame to yourself,

46:13.962 --> 46:15.295
the Marine Corps,

46:15.329 --> 46:18.932
the country and your family.

46:20.401 --> 46:22.702
Or...

46:22.736 --> 46:26.206
you help us,
and all of that goes away.

46:27.908 --> 46:29.643
Help you how?

46:29.677 --> 46:33.214
We send you back into the world
as if nothing happened.

46:33.248 --> 46:36.217
You help us figure out
what Abu Nazir's plan is.

46:39.488 --> 46:40.788
No trial?

46:40.822 --> 46:42.857
No charges, no trial.

46:44.226 --> 46:45.527
Jess and the kids?

46:45.561 --> 46:47.529
They'll never know.

46:47.563 --> 46:50.565
You quit politics,
move to the town of your choice

46:50.599 --> 46:53.134
somewhere far, far away.

46:54.436 --> 46:55.837
Immunity?

46:59.174 --> 47:01.476
You guys don't have the
power to give me that.

47:01.510 --> 47:04.478
You better hope we do.

47:34.478 --> 47:36.479
♪ ♪

47:58.402 --> 48:00.403
♪ ♪

48:11.516 --> 48:13.250
You okay?

48:22.426 --> 48:24.093
Let's have some fun.

48:24.128 --> 48:26.629
Hmm, fun.

48:38.943 --> 48:40.977
You want to have some fun, huh?

48:42.714 --> 48:44.781
(tires squealing) Oh, shit!

48:44.816 --> 48:47.283
(tires squealing, horns honking)

48:47.317 --> 48:49.585
(laughing)

48:57.160 --> 48:58.727
Yeah!

49:13.675 --> 49:15.075
Faster.

49:15.110 --> 49:16.510
- Faster!
- Okay. All right.

49:36.866 --> 49:39.901
Yeah! Okay.

49:42.939 --> 49:44.539
(laughing)

49:46.942 --> 49:48.910
(screaming)

49:50.779 --> 49:53.848
Stop! Finn, stop!

49:53.882 --> 49:55.549
Oh, fuck!

49:55.584 --> 49:57.051
You got to turn around!

49:57.085 --> 49:58.718
You got to go back there!

50:02.256 --> 50:03.756
- Fuck!
- Come on.

50:03.791 --> 50:06.225
Dana, please! If anyone finds
out about this, my life is over!

50:06.260 --> 50:08.060
Well, we at least
have to call 911!

50:08.095 --> 50:09.395
No. They can trace the call.

50:13.266 --> 50:15.934
See? She's fine, Dana, okay?

50:15.969 --> 50:18.370
He's calling 911. There's
nothing we can do about it.

50:18.404 --> 50:20.438
Finn, we almost killed someone!

50:20.473 --> 50:22.140
Dana, I'm begging you,
let's just get out of here.

50:22.174 --> 50:26.010
My dad is the vice president
of the United States.

50:27.279 --> 50:28.746
(moaning):
Oh, fuck me.

50:28.780 --> 50:31.415
Okay. Okay.

50:31.449 --> 50:33.016
Go.

50:45.028 --> 50:48.296
I assume you've spoken
to Roya about me.

50:50.499 --> 50:53.567
She was the one who suggested
I reestablish the relationship.

50:53.601 --> 50:55.668
Good.

50:55.703 --> 50:58.304
So if she comments
on your absence,

50:58.338 --> 51:00.405
- just tell her you were with me.
- With you?

51:00.440 --> 51:02.941
Tell her we couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

51:05.210 --> 51:08.146
The affair will be our
cover going forward.

51:08.180 --> 51:09.780
If you need me
for whatever reason,

51:09.814 --> 51:11.415
you just call and
say you miss me.

51:11.449 --> 51:12.783
I'll do the same.

51:12.817 --> 51:14.384
We'll meet at my apartment.

51:25.996 --> 51:27.963
(sighs)

51:54.921 --> 51:57.656
So Walden just stands there
and gets elected president?

51:59.092 --> 52:01.026
He could lose.

52:04.229 --> 52:06.598
Abu Nazir will find out
I'm working for you.

52:06.632 --> 52:09.066
No, he won't.
Not if we're careful.

52:09.101 --> 52:11.068
When he does,
he'll go after my family.

52:11.102 --> 52:12.469
That's how he operates.

52:12.503 --> 52:14.605
We'll protect your family.

52:28.353 --> 52:30.320

The last time
I went on a bender

53:58.276 --> 54:00.444
was when you went to the prom
with Billy Birkbeck

54:00.479 --> 54:01.812
instead of me.

54:01.847 --> 54:04.148
I was 17 years old.

54:04.183 --> 54:05.616
Where's your car?

54:05.651 --> 54:08.753
I left it outside a bar
in Fairfax. I took a cab.

54:11.056 --> 54:12.624
How's the flu?

54:12.658 --> 54:14.359
Greg just made that up.

54:14.393 --> 54:16.628
Don't blame him.
He was just doing his job.

54:25.872 --> 54:29.207
I'd like your permission
to come home.

54:30.709 --> 54:32.610
Okay.

54:32.644 --> 54:34.946
But I need the truth, Brody.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.981
That was the deal.

54:37.015 --> 54:38.382
If you want to come back,

54:38.416 --> 54:40.984
I need to know what is
going on with you.

54:41.019 --> 54:42.686
And don't give me any bullshit

54:42.720 --> 54:44.855
about a bender
and Billy Birkbeck.

54:44.889 --> 54:47.458
No more secrets.

54:47.492 --> 54:49.660
Can it wait until the morning?

54:49.694 --> 54:51.729
No, it can't.

54:53.766 --> 54:56.001
Okay.

54:57.670 --> 55:02.007
You're going to think this
is a little crazy, Jess.

55:03.243 --> 55:05.844
I'm working for the CIA.

55:05.879 --> 55:08.414
The CIA?

55:08.448 --> 55:09.681
Yep.

55:11.584 --> 55:13.318
Doing what?

55:13.352 --> 55:17.022
Helping out on matters
of national security.

55:17.056 --> 55:19.424
Brody, if this is
some more bullshit...

55:19.458 --> 55:21.192
It's not.

55:21.227 --> 55:23.328
I swear to God.

55:24.764 --> 55:26.965
It's the truth.

55:29.768 --> 55:32.070
I can't tell you
any more right now.

55:32.104 --> 55:35.240
I shouldn't have told you
this much already.

55:35.274 --> 55:37.776
(front door opens)

55:42.615 --> 55:43.681
You're home early.

55:47.453 --> 55:49.253
Nothing.
