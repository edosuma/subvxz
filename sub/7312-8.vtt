WEBVTT

00:38.081 --> 00:40.083
[screams]On the ground!

00:40.127 --> 00:41.693
NCIS!

00:41.737 --> 00:43.086
Don'’t move! Don't move!Don'’t shoot! Don't shoot!

00:43.130 --> 00:45.958
It'’s just some clothes
and, like, DVDs!

00:46.002 --> 00:48.091
I'’ll return them!

00:48.135 --> 00:51.051
What'’s NCIS?

00:51.094 --> 00:53.096
I can'’t believe some people
have never heard of us.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.794
You'’re under arrest
for espionage and terrorism.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.840
Wait, what?!

01:32.701 --> 01:34.050
Pretty cool piece of tech.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.444
Takes advantage of the new
credit cards designed

01:36.487 --> 01:39.273
so you can swipe your whole
wallet over the sensor

01:39.316 --> 01:40.665
when you make
a purchase.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.319
Because that extra
four seconds it takes

01:42.363 --> 01:44.843
to remove your
credit card is just

01:44.887 --> 01:46.106
plain un-American.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.324
This doesn'’t work.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.326
The point is that
you control the card,

01:49.370 --> 01:53.113
which in theory reduces fraud
risk at point of purchase.

01:53.156 --> 01:56.028
Still won'’t keep you hacky types
from stealing my numbers

01:56.072 --> 01:58.205
from the matrix, anyway.
Look at it, doesn'’t work.

01:58.248 --> 02:01.469
That'’s right. You should still
be terrified of my kind.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.123
[laughs]

02:06.082 --> 02:07.562
And apparently
22-year-old girls.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.304
I refuse to be afraid
of 22-year-old girls,

02:10.347 --> 02:12.132
no matter what kind of magical

02:12.175 --> 02:13.916
pick-pocketing devices
they'’re sporting.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.005
You know who the real
victim is? Artistry.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.485
ZIVA: If someone
wants something

02:17.528 --> 02:19.922
out of your pants, they should
have to use their hands.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.273
The thing about all this
virtual thievery is

02:23.317 --> 02:26.058
it'’s virtually impossible
to virtually police.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.191
How do you keep the
DiCaprio out of your head?

02:28.235 --> 02:30.759
Mm, yeah, he is dreamy.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.544
Hillary Lange picked
two dozen credit cards

02:33.588 --> 02:35.720
in less than an hour,
she burned all the accounts

02:35.764 --> 02:38.375
onto a blank one, went shopping.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.725
No one would
have known

02:40.769 --> 02:42.684
if she hadn'’t picked the
absolute wrong pocket.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.729
TONY:
Yep.

02:44.773 --> 02:47.036
Card number flagged on
the terror watch list.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.430
That'’s God's justice
right there.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.346
You think the pickpocket can
lead you to the cardholder?

02:52.389 --> 02:55.784
It'’d be easier
if you gave me a name.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.916
Name would just be fake,
but the account'’s real.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.964
I'’m gonna be tied up at this
review conference all week.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.095
Oh, there'’s
a good time.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.489
Reviewing old
case files.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.100
Well, it may sound dull, but
it'’s a useful educational tool.

03:08.144 --> 03:11.452
Also helps maintain continuity
within the agency.

03:11.495 --> 03:16.021
We are responsible for the work
performed by our predecessors.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.110
Tom Morrow called
me about lunch.

03:18.154 --> 03:19.503
Well, he'’s not gonna have time.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.591
Neither will you.

03:20.635 --> 03:21.897
Three bodies coming in

03:21.940 --> 03:23.333
from the Coast Guard.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.248
Suspected smugglers
shot off the coast of Florida.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.119
One'’s a Navy officer.

03:27.163 --> 03:30.297
All the physical evidence
is en route to Ms. Sciuto.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.821
Well, I usually like
an invite to a crime scene.

03:32.864 --> 03:36.694
It sank in the Gulf of Mexico.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.436
You do plan on talking to
that girl, don'’t you?

03:39.480 --> 03:41.482
Well, she is accused
of terrorism.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.440
She'’ll talk when
she'’s ready to talk.

03:46.835 --> 03:50.317
Hey... you okay?

03:56.018 --> 03:59.021
I think it'’s time.

03:59.064 --> 04:02.329
Okay, I'’ll give you
whatever you want!

04:02.372 --> 04:05.070
Just talk to me!

04:05.114 --> 04:07.290
Hello?!

04:07.334 --> 04:09.640
TONY: Do you guys know
that when people walk

04:09.684 --> 04:12.208
by those signs that say
"Beware Pickpocket,"

04:12.252 --> 04:13.470
they always tap
where their wallet is--

04:13.514 --> 04:14.645
back pocket, chest, coat.

04:14.689 --> 04:17.387
Artistry.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.781
A would-be artisan went for
my wallet once in Rome.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.652
How'’d it turn out
for the borseggiatore?

04:21.696 --> 04:23.263
McGEE:
You need to get the device

04:23.306 --> 04:26.048
closer to their wallets,
all right?

04:26.091 --> 04:28.398
You realize a 22-year-old girl
had this mastered.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.531
People mature much faster
these days, McGee.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.315
Yeah, present company excluded.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.713
That'’s not the guy.
Keep going.

04:38.756 --> 04:41.672
We cannot really be sure that,
because this girl crossed paths

04:41.716 --> 04:45.023
with him here yesterday, we will
cross paths with him today.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.068
TONY:
Also can'’t be sure

04:46.111 --> 04:47.025
that Gibbs will be
swilling coffee

04:47.069 --> 04:48.375
when we get
back to the office

04:48.418 --> 04:50.855
or you'’ll fumble
a simple American expression

04:50.899 --> 04:52.901
or that McGee will
sleep alone tonight,

04:52.944 --> 04:54.859
but people do tend
to follow patterns.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.035
Wait, wait, we got a match.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.515
The last person you scanned.

04:58.559 --> 04:59.647
Which one?

04:59.690 --> 05:00.648
ZIVA:
Turning right.

05:00.691 --> 05:01.866
Popped collar.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.520
Alley on 17th, McGee.

05:03.564 --> 05:06.567
TONY: Pull the van around.
That'’s our terrorist.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.573
McGEE: Whoever this guy is,
he gets around.

05:12.616 --> 05:13.704
The card'’s been used everywhere,

05:13.748 --> 05:16.054
from the Middle East
to Latin America

05:16.098 --> 05:17.404
to the Caribbean.

05:17.447 --> 05:18.535
Tony.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.537
Ninja senses
tingling?

05:20.581 --> 05:22.234
NCIS, drop your weapon!

05:22.278 --> 05:24.715
Hands in the air!
ZIVA:
Put it down!

05:24.759 --> 05:26.543
You put down
your weapon.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.719
[speaks Hebrew]

05:31.896 --> 05:32.897
Malachi?

05:36.727 --> 05:38.163
Hello, Ziva.

05:40.427 --> 05:43.343
Oh, good, the Israelis are back.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.397
Liat. Liat.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.746
It'’s like music.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.357
LIAT:
In Hebrew, it means

05:57.400 --> 05:59.924
"you are the one
for me," Tony.

05:59.968 --> 06:03.275
My name roughly translates to
"two parts of a leg."

06:03.319 --> 06:05.190
Liat is one of the most
common names in Israel.

06:05.234 --> 06:08.324
Where only the grandmothers
are named Ziva.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.327
So what brings you to DC?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.676
The cherry blossoms.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.417
That'’s in the spring, actually.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.810
TONY: I'’m afraid all
we have to offer

06:15.853 --> 06:18.247
in November are elections
and pardoned turkeys.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.640
I really like
those boots, Liat.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.685
Not speaking too fast
for you, am I?

06:21.729 --> 06:23.208
I understand.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.515
You'’re very, uh,
tongue-in-ear.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.431
She means tongue-in-cheek.Don'’t put words
in the girl'’s mouth.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.302
We are on vacation.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.435
McGEE: Tourists have
their passports scanned,

06:32.479 --> 06:34.219
they don'’t carry
firearms and clearly

06:34.263 --> 06:35.438
this is the new Ziva.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.005
In Mossad.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.528
Your replacement.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.225
MALACHI:
Did you expect

06:40.269 --> 06:42.793
we would never move on
after you left us?

06:42.837 --> 06:44.142
You left me.
TONY:
Let'’s not get

06:44.186 --> 06:46.057
hung up on who'’s left,
who'’s right

06:46.101 --> 06:47.145
and who'’s wrong.
Let'’s get back

06:47.189 --> 06:48.408
to the original
question.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.801
What are you doing here?

06:50.845 --> 06:51.802
TONY:
Hey, boss.

06:51.846 --> 06:52.977
Uh, we were just having

06:53.021 --> 06:54.631
a pretty good time
lying to each other,

06:54.675 --> 06:57.112
and I think that was
about to boil off, actually.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.330
If you intend to
detain us any longer,

06:58.374 --> 06:59.723
I would like to hear
a statement of cause.

06:59.767 --> 07:00.811
You'’re terrorists.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.857
[chuckles]
That is absurd.

07:02.900 --> 07:03.945
Not according to our director,

07:03.988 --> 07:05.425
who saw you
coming from

07:05.468 --> 07:07.296
a mile away.Losing your touch, Mal.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.646
You'’re in
the United States illegally.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.822
You'’re immigration now,
Special Agent Gibbs?

07:11.866 --> 07:13.824
Deport us then.

07:13.868 --> 07:14.869
Take them in.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.436
Figure out how
they got here.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.316
Do not need to
wait for me.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.709
Outsiders are not allowed

07:28.752 --> 07:31.320
to be unaccompanied
in this building.

07:31.363 --> 07:34.149
Ah, congratulation
on becoming an insider.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.499
Must be very proud.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.327
I am.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.416
And your family?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.548
How do they feel?

07:43.375 --> 07:46.378
You know, you were personally
selected by my father

07:46.422 --> 07:48.163
to fill a vacancy
in his roster,

07:48.206 --> 07:49.294
not his bloodline.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.513
And trust me, the second part

07:50.557 --> 07:51.862
is not something
you want to covet.

07:51.906 --> 07:54.778
You read up on me.

07:58.260 --> 08:02.394
You spent eight months
in paramilitary operations,

08:02.438 --> 08:04.962
helping to develop
the new Galil assault rifle.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.311
You won
the marksmanship ribbon

08:06.355 --> 08:08.618
for your outfit
four consecutive times.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.534
I have six.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.188
But I'’m not done.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.624
Benefit of youth.

08:14.668 --> 08:18.236
See, I would expect you
to look into past conduct.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.326
But you seem to only to care
about my abilities with a gun.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.719
[clicks tongue]

08:22.763 --> 08:24.504
You have a pet cat.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.548
Named Bill.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.855
I happen to like cats.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.248
Still, I feel this,

08:30.292 --> 08:33.948
uh, measuring contest would be
more at home in the men'’s room.

08:33.991 --> 08:34.992
Don'’t you think?

08:39.475 --> 08:41.782
Heard you got a
shipment in, Duck.

08:41.825 --> 08:45.176
The three bodies we were
expecting from the Gulf.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.570
You'’re fluent
in chicken scratch.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.572
Perhaps you can
make out this scrawl.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.488
Maybe some sort of acronym?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.795
C.I.W.S.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.884
Close-In Weapons System.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.016
McGEE: So a Coast Guard
cutter opened fire

08:59.060 --> 09:00.583
on a pleasure
fishing craft?

09:00.627 --> 09:02.280
With a Gatling gun?

09:02.324 --> 09:03.978
Claims these guys fired first.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.457
Who'’s this?

09:05.501 --> 09:07.764
Captain Caleb Burnett.

09:07.808 --> 09:11.376
He was on leave, helping
his brother pay the bills.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.596
Coast Guard approached

09:13.640 --> 09:15.250
three miles
off the coast of Florida.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.557
Saw crates being thrown
overboard, hailed a warning.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.994
Then the fireworks.

09:20.037 --> 09:23.737
Gulf Coast oil spill wreaked
havoc on the fishing business.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.260
Turned to smuggling?

09:25.303 --> 09:28.132
Would you believe
that human and animal hair

09:28.176 --> 09:30.134
has been found to be
one of the most

09:30.178 --> 09:32.615
effective agents in
cleaning up the oil?

09:32.659 --> 09:34.095
I mean, from across
the country,

09:34.138 --> 09:36.619
over half a million pounds
of hair has been donated

09:36.663 --> 09:39.317
by barber shops,
salons and pet stores.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.797
Says the dark-haired guy
was the shooter.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.625
According to the
Coast Guard report.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.148
But they may
have that wrong.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.324
Abby didn'’t find
any gunshot residue

09:46.368 --> 09:48.239
on this man'’s hands.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.024
And I just
sent swabs out

09:50.067 --> 09:51.634
from the other two,
for analysis.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.418
What else did CGIS miss?

09:53.462 --> 09:57.161
Well, I found an anomaly on
the back of this man'’s skull.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.337
Large caliber rounds
would inflict

09:59.381 --> 10:04.255
this sort of damage,
but not that small hole.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.432
And that is stippling.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.000
I got no clue what
they were smuggling.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.002
Port of origin
was near Havana.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.265
Maybe they were
smuggling cigars.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.180
Drugs.
Drugs are always good.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.356
Pirates do like rum.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.489
It'’s not a
guessing game.

10:20.532 --> 10:21.882
GIBBS: Tell me
you got something, Abbs.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.579
Well, I got a lot, Gibbs.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.886
I mean, with our mystery
smugglers and our

10:25.929 --> 10:28.192
Mossad operatives
in their dark clothing,

10:28.236 --> 10:29.367
sticking to the shadows.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.413
Yeah, '’cause that
hasn'’t gotten old.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.154
Black on black never
goes out of style, Gibbs,

10:33.197 --> 10:34.808
just so you know.
But it would be nice

10:34.851 --> 10:36.113
if they would play
things, you know,

10:36.157 --> 10:37.549
above the board every
once in a while.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.943
Although, last time
Netanyahu was in town,

10:39.987 --> 10:42.380
they did everything according
to standard protocol

10:42.424 --> 10:46.384
and then the airlines lost a
bag of his advance team'’s guns.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.864
Personally, I-I don'’t
like losing things.

10:49.605 --> 10:52.129
Did I just give
you a clue?

10:52.173 --> 10:53.914
It'’s what you do, Abbs.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.351
Then let me give you more.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.702
ABBY: These are the slugs
pulled from the boat.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.704
There'’s a handful
of nine-millimeters

11:01.748 --> 11:05.403
mixed in with the Coast Guard'’s
20-mill big boys.

11:05.447 --> 11:06.796
Was kind of a bad idea

11:06.840 --> 11:08.668
to shoot at a cutter
with a nine-millimeter.

11:08.711 --> 11:11.409
It'’s like trying to put out a
forest fire with a Super Soaker.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.889
Right? Right.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.586
Um, so...

11:14.630 --> 11:16.850
I went through
all three of our victims,

11:16.893 --> 11:18.852
and there'’s no
corresponding GSR.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.070
Smugglers never fired a shot.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.637
Well, not these guys.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.247
The nine-millimeter

11:23.291 --> 11:25.249
might match the anomaly
that Ducky found

11:25.293 --> 11:27.425
in the captain'’s skull
at close range.

11:27.469 --> 11:30.080
Captain and crew
were executed on the boat.

11:30.124 --> 11:34.084
Shooter fires at the cutter.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.304
Goes into the water
with the crates.

11:37.871 --> 11:41.570
Empty, which suggests that
whatever was being smuggled

11:41.613 --> 11:43.354
has floated away.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.835
Or whoever swam away.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.925
GIBBS:
Breathing holes.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.927
Somebody could
have gotten caught

11:50.971 --> 11:52.712
trying to sneak somebody
into the country,

11:52.755 --> 11:54.670
and then those
somebodies...

11:56.803 --> 11:58.326
Are still unaccounted for.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.546
Crew was killed
as a smoke screen.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.420
And they swam to shore
the last three miles

12:05.463 --> 12:07.727
under the cover of night.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.512
That'’s dark.

12:10.555 --> 12:13.254
Even for black
on black.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.567
[door opens]

12:23.830 --> 12:26.223
You know about
the three bodies downstairs,

12:26.267 --> 12:28.356
killed in transit
from Cuba to Florida?

12:29.444 --> 12:30.793
Why would we--
Don'’t.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.404
Their murder was a distraction

12:33.448 --> 12:36.320
to occupy the Coast Guard
on the surface

12:36.364 --> 12:38.322
while their cargo
swam to shore.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.455
You killed Americans
to get here?

12:40.498 --> 12:43.763
Your boss did not send you
here to kill smugglers.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.636
Who were in
the crates?

12:50.334 --> 12:51.292
Who are you tracking?

12:51.335 --> 12:52.597
[sighs]

12:52.641 --> 12:54.774
Three members
of a Palestinian terror network.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.515
You followed them from Cuba?

13:00.823 --> 13:02.999
Then why do you search
for them in DC?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.221
They'’re not.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.745
They'’re a step ahead of
the assassins already.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.094
They'’re an advance team.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.792
LIAT:
You'’re right.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.271
They areassassins.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.447
And this is where
their target will be.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.101
Who is their target?

13:21.235 --> 13:22.540
Your father is coming.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.064
He'’ll be here
in two days.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.762
My father has not left
Israeli soil in 12 years.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.851
We are not lying.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.157
We got three killers to find.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.636
You get DiNozzo
and McGee caught up.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.942
I'’m going
to stock up.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.901
It'’s going to be a long night.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.816
[door closes]

13:44.127 --> 13:45.737
Officer Hadar.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.652
You almost made me
spill my coffee.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.612
Americans--
you can never just say hello.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.874
How about "Shalom"?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.745
Hello and good-bye.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.966
And peace,
Agent Gibbs.

13:57.010 --> 14:00.143
Not a lot of that
when you'’re around.

14:00.187 --> 14:03.146
Do you have a minute to sit
down with my director?

14:03.190 --> 14:04.495
Please, come with me.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.410
He'’s waiting for you.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.336
ELI:
Tea and coffee.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.383
There was a time when
this conversation

14:22.426 --> 14:25.647
would take place over
something a bit more exciting.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.388
GIBBS:
I'’m still on the clock.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.216
No one'’s stopping you.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.392
But, along with several
other vices,

14:31.435 --> 14:33.176
drinking is now part
of my past.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.005
Do you know that they say
about a man with no vices?

14:36.049 --> 14:37.441
Yes.

14:37.485 --> 14:40.923
He has incredibly
annoying virtues.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.012
Which one brings you to town?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.709
Loyalty.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.798
I was summoned.

14:46.842 --> 14:50.454
Vance'’s review of the
international case files

14:50.498 --> 14:53.022
and his request
for contributions

14:53.066 --> 14:55.111
from every NCIS director.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.417
Not every director.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.680
No.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.203
Not Jenny Shepard.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.249
She was truly responsible

15:02.292 --> 15:04.338
for bringing
our organizations together.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.820
And for bringing
my daughter into your life.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.999
But I am not here for her.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.391
For Ziva.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.393
Yes.
You'’re not here
for Ziva.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.568
She has a name.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.920
I am aware. I gave it to her.

15:22.791 --> 15:26.229
Director Vance
has a suite at the Freemont.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.144
He'’s got a system
where he can videoconference

15:28.188 --> 15:30.538
any agent who couldn'’t
attend personally.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.496
You didn'’t have
to make the trip.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.673
There is a case.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.893
Amsterdam.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.242
Then you do know.No, just bits.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.765
Pieces.

15:43.116 --> 15:46.771
For the first time,
all parties involved

15:46.815 --> 15:48.773
will peel back the veil.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.427
This a witch hunt?

15:50.471 --> 15:52.081
With you wearing the pointy hat?

15:54.779 --> 15:57.434
It may be necessary
for me to defend myself.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.088
Need a lot of that.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.263
The assassins--

16:00.307 --> 16:03.614
I am surprised-- and
not unimpressed--

16:03.658 --> 16:05.051
that they have made it this far.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.096
But I am not concerned.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.055
My people
will ensure my safety.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.317
Nope.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.102
Already got three bodies
on the slab.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.626
You should have told us
you were coming.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.020
But, like it or not,

16:18.064 --> 16:20.370
protecting you
is my responsibility.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.200
A joint effort, I think.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.161
MALACHI:
The three remaining members

16:28.204 --> 16:29.771
of the Palestinian
Resistance Front,

16:29.814 --> 16:31.120
an anti-Zionist
group responsible

16:31.164 --> 16:32.469
for many
Israeli deaths.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.645
We'’ve spent years
tracking them.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.996
And still
there are three. Hm.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.475
No, there are onlythree.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.477
I assure you, when they
started, there were many more.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.131
Karif Yasin.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.611
Explosives expert.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.961
Ramsi Ashor.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.658
Intel specialist.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.052
Abasi El Masri, their leader.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.880
El Masri is trained
in NATO weaponry

16:51.923 --> 16:53.229
and has a degree
in advanced engineering.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.970
TONY: I don'’t care
how many degrees he has.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.406
If he'’s serious
about assassinating Eli,

16:56.450 --> 16:58.495
he'’s going to need something
more than a pistol.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.193
Tony, it is not
about the size of the gun...

17:00.236 --> 17:01.455
It is about the will
of the shooter.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.068
We will make sure
they do not succeed.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.463
If necessary, we will place
ourself in the line of fire.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.681
"All someone needs
is the willingness

17:10.725 --> 17:12.031
to trade his life for mine."

17:12.074 --> 17:14.337
You know--
In the Line of Fire.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.512
Kennedy said that.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.079
"Why don'’t you just
memorize your lines

17:17.123 --> 17:19.560
and don'’t bump into
the furniture, McBartlett."

17:19.603 --> 17:21.127
Spencer Tracy said that.

17:21.170 --> 17:25.131
Why isn'’t Secret Service
or the State Department

17:25.174 --> 17:27.698
handling Director David'’s
protection detail?

17:27.742 --> 17:30.136
The director does not want
anyone to know he'’s coming.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.094
TONY [chuckling]:
Oh.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.356
A bang-up job, I'’d say.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.792
How did they find out?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.839
TONY:
What?

17:37.882 --> 17:40.537
No big, fat lie ready to go?

17:40.581 --> 17:42.496
You really don'’t know.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.153
BEN ROBINSON: Which case files
are we looking at?

17:47.196 --> 17:50.025
Are we talking 1988 or '’98?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.679
We finished with '’88
an hour ago, Ben.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.159
If you consult your schedule,

17:53.202 --> 17:55.552
you'’ll also notice
the upcoming lunch break.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.337
If the rest of us can wait...

17:57.380 --> 17:59.382
Yeah, the rest of you
are on the East Coast, Leon.

17:59.426 --> 18:02.081
It'’s breakfast time in Mazatlan.
[chuckles]

18:02.124 --> 18:05.606
Hey. It'’s dinnertime here,
and I'’m holding off.

18:05.649 --> 18:09.392
Plus, I am dangerously close to
missing my dinner reservation.

18:09.436 --> 18:13.483
VANCE: All right, if we'’ll open
the file code-named Leviathan.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.485
Uh, for the record,
I was not involved

18:15.529 --> 18:17.096
directly in that case, so...

18:17.139 --> 18:19.663
any, uh, observations
I have about it

18:19.707 --> 18:22.971
are purely impartial, so...

18:23.014 --> 18:25.147
Damn it. I brought
the wrong cane.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.280
Other cane'’s got the flask.

18:27.323 --> 18:28.759
Hey, Riley.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.239
Where'’d they dig you up?

18:34.374 --> 18:36.506
This will
keep you sharper.
Oh, please.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.509
The coffee here is weaker
than a Frenchman'’s handshake.

18:39.553 --> 18:42.295
You ever heard of
Tristan da Cunha?

18:42.338 --> 18:43.774
Uh-uh.
Yeah.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.299
Neither did the rest of the
world, or so I thought.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.344
Archipelago in the
South Atlantic.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.998
I was building a
mission there.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.304
VANCE:
You following all this, Ben?

18:51.347 --> 18:52.609
Haven'’t installed
the phone lines yet.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.263
BEN:
Yeah, I remember now.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.178
Okay...

18:56.222 --> 18:59.138
Former Agent McCallister
will take over

18:59.181 --> 19:01.705
while I take a short break.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.838
Oh, look at this-- I get to
play schoolteacher again.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.100
All right, everybody, shut up.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.581
Robinson, put those
huevosaway.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.974
Nelson, feet off the table.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.193
My bad.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.629
Forgot you could see me.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.631
How you doing, Roy?

19:14.675 --> 19:17.721
Bodies from the Gulf were
all executed at close range.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.070
By whom?

19:19.114 --> 19:20.202
Not the Coast Guard.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.986
Three Palestinians
they were smuggling

19:22.030 --> 19:23.901
into the
United States.

19:23.945 --> 19:28.210
Amsterdam on today'’s
docket, Leon?

19:28.254 --> 19:30.299
Not till Friday.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.954
Eli'’s here already,
isn'’t he?

19:32.997 --> 19:34.303
You knew he'’d come.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.175
You dangle the right bait,
you can catch any game.

19:36.218 --> 19:39.003
Palestinians are following
the same logic.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.570
Chasing Eli.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.224
That was unexpected.
We got to find them first.

19:42.268 --> 19:45.009
Then we need to get
on Eli'’s protection detail.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.273
I know he'’s going to make it
miserable for us.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.189
Got McGee babysitting
him in a safe house.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.539
We'’re running drills
to secure the hotel.
Good.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.845
How'’s our own David
handling it?

19:54.889 --> 19:58.414
Her father left her
to die in a desert.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.069
So it'’s a problem?

20:01.112 --> 20:03.550
Would be for me.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.857
Won'’t be for Ziva.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.122
A sniper across the
street would have a shot

20:11.166 --> 20:12.863
into any room
on this side.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.125
Chemical agent
could be disseminated

20:14.169 --> 20:15.257
through the air ducts.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.955
Take out a whole floor.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.261
Could spiral down
from the roof.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.482
Too many access
points to cover.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.791
Nobody protects you quite
like a trained killer.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.967
They certainly know
all the moves.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.101
How long have you and Liat
been together as partners?

20:33.144 --> 20:35.277
You must be her first.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.410
Partner, I mean.

20:37.453 --> 20:38.976
She is young.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.935
What she lacks
in experience,

20:40.978 --> 20:44.068
she makes up for with a passion
unlike I have ever seen.

20:44.112 --> 20:48.290
Am I sensing something
between the two of you?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.466
Nothing serious.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.772
You haven'’t slept
together then?

20:51.815 --> 20:53.600
Oh, of course
we are sleeping together.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.775
It'’s just nothing serious.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.559
Got to get back to Israel.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.257
Next year, Jerusalem,
my friend.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.388
[sighs]
Yeah.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.737
ZIVA:
Given my father'’s

21:00.781 --> 21:03.087
many enemies, we would
have been better served

21:03.131 --> 21:06.395
with advance notice.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.179
Do you include yourself?

21:09.311 --> 21:11.835
Among his enemies?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.750
I'’m doing
a threat assessment.

21:13.794 --> 21:16.013
I wonder if protecting his life

21:16.057 --> 21:17.754
is an appropriate
assignment for you.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.190
Let us find out.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.105
We will walk the
garage approach.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.499
I will play my father,

21:23.543 --> 21:26.763
you will try to kill me.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.420
Out front is far too visible.

21:31.464 --> 21:34.075
We are assessing feasibility
of a subterranean approach.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.425
The corridor is primary,

21:36.469 --> 21:38.993
service entrance,
secondary.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.562
It is the best way

21:42.605 --> 21:44.433
to predict all possible
attack angles, Gibbs.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.435
I will be playing
my father,

21:46.479 --> 21:49.917
Tony, Malachi and Liat
are the assassins.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.006
Okay. Your father has
a bodyguard.

21:54.748 --> 21:57.490
So follow me,
Director David.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.537
We do not like
that area

22:01.581 --> 22:03.365
because of the
vulnerability at the apex.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.152
West side, last car
on the left.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.024
TONY:
Oh, come on!

22:12.548 --> 22:14.376
There are different techniques

22:14.420 --> 22:17.336
for protecting a young man
and an older man.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.815
I would imagine
he would move

22:18.859 --> 22:21.905
more slowly than
he once did.

22:21.949 --> 22:25.256
GIBBS:
Convertible.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.041
One more shooter left.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.965
[tires squealing]Truck!

22:39.532 --> 22:43.623
LIAT: A three-man team
is one thing...

22:43.666 --> 22:46.800
but we should not be
so naiïve as to assume

22:46.843 --> 22:48.497
that means only three guns.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.978
I'’m dead...

22:51.021 --> 22:52.675
but so are you.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.212
Home safe from the safe house,
I see-- with sandwiches.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.910
I'’ve had had
a very educational morning.

23:09.953 --> 23:12.391
Good, '’cause Liat
killed Gibbs and Ziva.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.653
Mmm! Meatballs.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.394
We killed you
first, Tony.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.616
Oh, I'’ve seen it
a million times.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.401
The pretty, popular girl
gets jealous

23:22.444 --> 23:24.228
when the hot
new transfer comes in

23:24.272 --> 23:25.752
and steals all the spotlight.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.537
It'’s pretty much a staple
of every high school movie

23:28.581 --> 23:31.453
from the '’70s and '80s:
Heathers, Fast Times...

23:31.497 --> 23:34.413
Who got jealous in
Fast Times?

23:34.456 --> 23:37.459
God, I like Phoebe Cates.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.374
What'’d Eli David have to say?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.071
Well, he said that,
in Israel,

23:41.115 --> 23:43.900
they call backgammon
"Shesh Besh."

23:43.944 --> 23:45.424
But I actually
did learn something.

23:45.467 --> 23:49.210
Turns out that, before becoming
Eli'’s personal cleaner,

23:49.253 --> 23:53.562
and right-hand man,
Officer Amit Hadar

23:53.606 --> 23:54.955
infiltrated the PRF.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.478
Now, he said
their intel guy,

23:56.522 --> 23:59.394
Ashor, was preoccupied
with American transports

23:59.438 --> 24:00.700
down the East Coast.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.179
He thinks they'’re gonna go
for firepower

24:02.223 --> 24:03.354
before they take their shot.

24:03.398 --> 24:06.357
It'’s a good theory.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.272
Tim-Amit;

24:08.316 --> 24:10.840
palindromic pals.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.016
Now, the Palestinians'’ last
known location

24:13.060 --> 24:14.670
is a thousand miles south of DC.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.933
Now every major and minor
airport in between has

24:16.977 --> 24:19.675
their photos posted.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.938
I'’ve got alerts at the train
stations, bus stations,

24:21.982 --> 24:25.115
local LEOs up and down the coast
as well as any and all

24:25.159 --> 24:27.161
hardware shipments,
commercial or military.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.294
I have hung a net.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.514
I do not know
who "Annette" is

24:32.558 --> 24:35.343
or why you are so proud
of killing her.[phone rings]

24:35.386 --> 24:37.476
No, what I mean is,
if they make a move,

24:37.519 --> 24:38.868
[phone rings]we'’re gonna know about it.

24:38.912 --> 24:39.869
DiNozzo.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.392
All right.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.482
Send the manifest.
We'’re on the way.

24:43.525 --> 24:46.702
Transport truck just got
hijacked near Fort A.P. Hill.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.443
Army contractor.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.140
Well, see? We know about it.

24:50.184 --> 24:53.056
Take over the investigation
of the weapons hijacking.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.058
It'’s connected
to our terrorist pursuit.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.626
El Masri'’s got his weapons,
he just needs a window.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.889
Then let'’s make sure
they'’re all tightly shut.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.108
GIBBS:
You ever consider

25:01.151 --> 25:03.284
shifting this conference
to the Navy Yard?

25:03.327 --> 25:05.895
These guys are here
to kill Eli David.

25:05.939 --> 25:09.159
As tempting as that may be
to facilitate...

25:09.203 --> 25:12.075
I don'’t want to have to explain
to the people in this room

25:12.119 --> 25:16.079
that my team can'’t secure a
hotel from three terrorists.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.604
Leon, if this is
a matter of pride...

25:18.647 --> 25:20.649
It'’s a matter
of principle, Gibbs.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.695
We stand on
their shoulders.

25:22.738 --> 25:25.567
These people built
the integrity of NCIS.

25:25.611 --> 25:29.092
They did their work honorably,
consistently and transparently.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.355
And I'’ll be damned if that's
gonna change on my watch.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.488
There something going on
I should know about?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.883
No, Gibbs,
everything'’s just fine.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.581
We'’ll be covering the first
chapters of my career.

25:39.625 --> 25:43.585
I bet you'’d just love to have
a committee of people who had,

25:43.629 --> 25:45.805
wanted, or actively want your
job combing through mistakes

25:45.848 --> 25:47.371
you made when you were 27.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.851
Yeah? So why do it?

25:48.895 --> 25:52.942
Protect the guy we invited,
find the ones we didn'’t.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.031
You got
any more questions, ask Eli.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.078
McGEE:
Ziva, besides the CROW,

25:58.121 --> 25:59.688
how many carbines?

25:59.732 --> 26:01.603
Uh, five were still in
the truck.

26:01.647 --> 26:02.996
That leaves
the hijackers with...

26:03.039 --> 26:05.868
six Sig Sauers. Ugh!

26:05.912 --> 26:07.957
Seven assault rifles,

26:08.001 --> 26:10.612
an XM-320 grenade launcher,

26:10.656 --> 26:14.442
body armor and a SPIKE
antitank guided missile.

26:14.485 --> 26:17.053
That'’s stacking up to be
a lot less precision attempt

26:17.097 --> 26:18.620
and more Wile E. Coyote.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.970
You know, more
and more elaborate,

26:21.014 --> 26:22.015
out-of-proportion tactics?

26:22.058 --> 26:23.582
Did you know
Wile E. Coyote was based

26:23.625 --> 26:25.409
on a character out
of a Mark Twain book?

26:25.453 --> 26:27.107
It'’s true.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.065
Twain described the coyote

26:29.109 --> 26:31.241
as a living, breathing
"allegory of want."

26:31.285 --> 26:33.853
GIBBS: As fanatical as the
three we'’re looking for.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.724
Did the Director agree
to a change of venue?

26:35.768 --> 26:37.857
Ah, the conference stays put.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.076
I guess he'’d rather we...
do our jobs?

26:45.168 --> 26:47.257
All right, now, boss,
this is the thing

26:47.301 --> 26:50.652
that we really, really need
to worry about.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.741
It'’s a lighter,
modified version

26:52.785 --> 26:54.308
of the Common Remotely
Operated Weapon.

26:54.351 --> 26:55.875
It has a thermal-imaging system,

26:55.918 --> 26:58.225
state-of-the-art sensor
and camera.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.140
CROW can be equipped with
multiple machine guns.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.620
Mounted and controlled
off location,

27:01.663 --> 27:02.969
it can turn one man into...

27:03.012 --> 27:04.927
...a one-man army.
I got it.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.233
Like Liat demonstrated.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.104
Now, I can
bring up the...

27:08.148 --> 27:09.584
Boss! Hi, guys.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.630
Just found a stolen car
abandoned in Friendship Heights.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.327
It looks like it might be
the one

27:13.370 --> 27:14.894
the Palestinians used in
the hijacking.

27:14.937 --> 27:15.895
Had it towed in.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.813
[sniffs] Ugh!

27:20.856 --> 27:23.293
What is that smell?

27:23.337 --> 27:26.688
Well, I'’ve got every reason

27:26.732 --> 27:28.864
to believe that these guys
didn'’t leave this car

27:28.908 --> 27:30.649
from the time they stole it.

27:30.692 --> 27:33.129
Now, that was two days ago,
in Florida.

27:33.173 --> 27:34.783
They'’ve racked up a lot of
mileage since then.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.306
It'’s an old model,
so there'’s no GPS.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.656
I can'’t determine
their exact route,

27:37.699 --> 27:39.745
but I would wager that
it wasn'’t interstates.

27:39.788 --> 27:40.789
Old school...

27:40.833 --> 27:41.790
with a twist.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.142
Did any of them have an
engineering background?

27:46.186 --> 27:50.146
Yes. The leader.
El Masri.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.974
Looks like he rigged
this up on the fly

27:52.018 --> 27:53.715
with parts you can get
at a truck stop.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.238
It'’s a refueling system.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.241
They did not stop any more
than they absolutely had to.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.373
I'’ve pulled some hair samples.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.504
I'’m certain they're gonna
correspond

28:00.548 --> 28:01.810
with the hair samples
from the crates.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.072
I mean,
it'’s the same guys.

28:03.116 --> 28:06.162
Yes, these men
are hunters.
Yeah.

28:06.206 --> 28:09.252
And if you'’ve ever spent an
entire day in a deer blind,

28:09.296 --> 28:11.907
you know that you do not
want to open those-- ugh.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.391
You should see your dad.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.441
How would that help the case?

28:24.485 --> 28:26.617
Oh, it... it wouldn'’t.

28:26.661 --> 28:29.055
Have you even
spoken to him?

28:29.098 --> 28:30.447
No.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.060
Okay.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.238
What does it matter to you?

28:47.029 --> 28:48.770
Do you think it'’s just by chance

28:48.814 --> 28:50.511
that he came back
into your life?

28:52.078 --> 28:56.604
I mean, what about Gibbs
and his father, and Tony?

28:56.647 --> 29:02.044
Just comes a point, you know,
in your lifetime where...

29:02.088 --> 29:06.005
where they come back
into your life...

29:06.048 --> 29:08.442
because... because
they matter to you.

29:08.485 --> 29:14.013
And because
you matter to him.

29:16.102 --> 29:19.366
I mean, I suppose
that-that sounds complicated...

29:19.409 --> 29:21.368
but...

29:21.411 --> 29:23.283
believe me...

29:24.675 --> 29:27.809
...it'’s not nearly
as complicated as...

29:27.853 --> 29:30.159
knowing that...

29:30.203 --> 29:34.337
they'’re never ever
gonna come back again.

29:39.038 --> 29:41.823
Agh! Amit, you'’re
killing me.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.782
[laughs]

29:47.307 --> 29:49.613
Oh, prison guard has come
to check up on us.

29:49.657 --> 29:52.921
Hadar, no one taught you.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.444
You let your boss win.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.838
Hiding him does
not make him safe.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.275
Al-Masri has been
waiting years for the directive

29:59.319 --> 30:00.581
to step away from home.

30:00.624 --> 30:01.843
They will find him.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.845
Somewhere on a
piece of paper,

30:03.889 --> 30:05.847
it has been written.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.110
A schedule, the
name Eli David,

30:08.154 --> 30:10.199
where and when.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.505
They prey on human error.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.289
You ever make
any of those, Eli?

30:13.333 --> 30:17.119
In Israel, I travel
with a team of armed guards

30:17.163 --> 30:19.295
behind four-inch
bulletproof glass,

30:19.339 --> 30:22.081
separating me from
the world like a sweatbox,

30:22.124 --> 30:24.518
even in autumn.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.613
I was looking forward...

30:32.656 --> 30:35.355
to the chill
of an East Coast winter.

30:35.398 --> 30:38.053
I understand
the air here is different.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.707
Open a window.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.975
I even bought gloves
for the occasion.

30:47.019 --> 30:50.674
Agent Gibbs,

30:50.718 --> 30:53.939
I'’m just saying I would
like to go for a walk.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.989
ELI: I ask for a walk,
I get a tour of your city.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.991
I'’m not complaining.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.864
Movement gets
the blood flowing,

31:05.907 --> 31:07.474
stimulates the mind.

31:07.517 --> 31:12.174
It can even create
the illusion... of freedom.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.697
I'’m a magician.

31:13.741 --> 31:17.092
Mm. Well, I cannot disagree
with that, Agent Gibbs.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.441
You have a way

31:18.485 --> 31:20.791
of making my family disappear.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.011
It'’s all about perspective.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.360
Peanut?

31:24.404 --> 31:27.537
No, thank you.

31:27.581 --> 31:28.974
HADAR:
This is a fool'’s errand.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.019
Well, first rule of fishing--

31:31.063 --> 31:32.934
patience is everything.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.196
A fishing expedition.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.156
You saw what they did

31:37.199 --> 31:40.376
to the last fishermen
they encountered.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.638
Um...

31:41.682 --> 31:43.640
[clears throat]

31:43.684 --> 31:45.729
[coughing]

31:45.773 --> 31:47.035
All units report.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.602
TONY:
Position one,

31:48.645 --> 31:49.559
all clear.

31:51.170 --> 31:53.737
ZIVA:
Position two...

31:53.781 --> 31:56.131
possible vehicle match
at the end of the street.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.828
Liat, you'’re on it?

31:57.872 --> 31:59.569
LIAT:
On my way.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.355
All right, running plates.
Liat, check it out.

32:02.398 --> 32:03.834
I'’m here.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.619
I got to hand it
to your father, Ziva.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.795
He has who knows
how many guns trained on him

32:07.838 --> 32:09.579
right now,
and he is completely oblivious.

32:09.623 --> 32:10.929
ZIVA:
No, he'’s aware.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.974
He is always aware
of what he does.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.237
Not caring
about the consequences

32:15.281 --> 32:17.022
is what makes him who he is.

32:19.633 --> 32:22.070
Plates are stolen.
Liat, you got a visual?

32:22.114 --> 32:24.246
Position three.
Car'’s empty.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.944
Liat, your 6:00.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.033
I have a visual
on Ramzi Ashor.

32:28.076 --> 32:28.772
I got no shot.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.254
What about
the other two?

32:32.298 --> 32:33.647
Liat'’s got a bead on one.

32:33.690 --> 32:34.778
Searching for the others.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.305
I see the second one, Yasin.
Gibbs, take cover.

32:40.436 --> 32:41.655
GIBBS:
Move! Now!

32:41.698 --> 32:42.743
Out of the way!

32:42.786 --> 32:44.658
[pedestrians screaming]

32:47.269 --> 32:49.793
Drop your weapon.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.667
Ziva, talk to me.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.675
You tell me-- where is he?
Where is the third?

33:08.812 --> 33:09.770
You did good.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.511
Toda.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.469
So did you.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.531
You consider yourself heroic?

33:31.574 --> 33:34.882
This is a minor interruption.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.668
Eli David will be eliminated.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.757
Interrogation is
a waste of time.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.324
I can withstand anything you do.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.673
I will not reveal anything.

33:43.717 --> 33:44.674
Yeah, I know.

33:44.718 --> 33:45.675
Where'’s El Masri?

33:49.244 --> 33:53.074
You could not possibly know
the sort David is.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.120
Oh, yeah, he'’s an awful
son of a bitch,

33:55.163 --> 33:56.817
everybody knows that.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.210
I'’m still not going
to let you murder him.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.081
It'’s not murder.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.778
It'’s war.

34:01.822 --> 34:07.175
I pity you Americans,
because you inherited it.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.351
You tried to reason
your way into it.

34:09.395 --> 34:10.439
Economically,

34:10.483 --> 34:13.051
politically, theoretically.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.228
But we have seen the blood.

34:16.271 --> 34:19.187
We have heard the cries.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.364
Our war is here.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.192
You two were on patrol.

34:24.236 --> 34:27.369
You left El Masri alone.

34:27.413 --> 34:32.026
No backup, no support.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.811
Nothing but a pile
of stolen weapons.

34:40.034 --> 34:42.776
So is that where he is?

34:42.819 --> 34:44.691
He'’s placing weapons?

34:47.781 --> 34:50.262
Do you know where Eli David
is supposed to be today?

35:01.490 --> 35:03.971
The answer to both
is the same.

35:06.147 --> 35:09.063
Eli David will be
lying dead in the street.

35:10.804 --> 35:13.067
And Abasi El Masri will be

35:13.111 --> 35:14.982
standing over him.

35:17.158 --> 35:17.941
Leon.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.073
Yes.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.161
This is incredible.

35:20.205 --> 35:23.425
Pretzel with
peanut butter inside.

35:23.469 --> 35:26.428
This is American ingenuity.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.952
I should cancel
that conference.Not on my account.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.303
It'’s not just your safety
I'’m concerned about, Eli.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.305
I'’m responsible for all the
members of that committee.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.263
You really
screwed me here.

35:35.307 --> 35:38.310
Did you think I wanted
the assassins to follow me?

35:38.353 --> 35:40.964
I think you told them
where to find you.

35:41.008 --> 35:42.705
He is a splinter
in my toe, Leon.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.316
He has been for years.

35:44.359 --> 35:47.449
If I do not extract him now,
it could become infected.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.886
That'’s nasty, Eli.

35:49.930 --> 35:51.410
Yet illustrative.

35:51.453 --> 35:56.632
A couple of the former directors
are saying that this chaos

35:56.676 --> 35:58.199
is the result of bad blood

35:58.243 --> 35:59.200
between you and me.Hmm.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.201
They'’re saying
that once we get

36:00.245 --> 36:01.898
to the subject of Amsterdam,

36:01.942 --> 36:04.771
it'’ll be about one of us trying
to make the other one look bad.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.251
But you and I know better.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.296
I never wanted to revisit
this in the first place.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.994
Leon, your first
mission in Amsterdam

36:11.038 --> 36:12.996
was the beginning
of your career.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.476
We gave you a life,

36:14.520 --> 36:15.999
but you should
want to know

36:16.043 --> 36:17.740
if it was not
all just a lie.

36:17.784 --> 36:22.005
They are all
here, Leon.

36:22.049 --> 36:26.009
I have delivered you
each and every man and woman,

36:26.053 --> 36:28.098
everyone who knows everything.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.188
Now, you must

36:30.231 --> 36:33.539
be courageous
and learn the truth.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.026
El Masri will
try and kill you

36:43.070 --> 36:44.245
before that happens,
you know that.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.205
No matter how many resources
we put in his way.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.424
Let him come.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.600
He is one; we are many.

36:51.644 --> 36:55.561
And our people are
supposed to be better.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.259
If he manages
to get through and to kill me,

36:58.303 --> 37:00.522
I wouldn'’t want
to go on, anyway.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.742
[chuckles]

37:15.842 --> 37:18.714
I understand you volunteered
for this detail.

37:18.758 --> 37:20.150
Yes.

37:20.194 --> 37:22.675
To protect my director.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.285
Oh.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.118
All right, let'’s go.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.818
That is all you'’re
going to say to me?

37:35.862 --> 37:37.472
What is the point?

37:37.516 --> 37:39.126
I know this face.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.650
You made the same one
when I told my brother

37:41.694 --> 37:43.304
he could not buy
you a pony.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.175
Huh.

37:45.219 --> 37:47.090
Ziva, if you
want to talk,

37:47.134 --> 37:48.570
we will talk.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.398
I'’m not going to beg.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.487
Why not?

37:52.531 --> 37:54.097
You know, confronted
with the prospect

37:54.141 --> 37:55.577
of your own death,
another man...

37:55.621 --> 37:56.578
a lesser man...

37:56.622 --> 37:58.145
A human man!

37:58.188 --> 37:59.364
Would want to.

38:02.062 --> 38:06.588
Ziva, you are not dead.

38:06.632 --> 38:11.158
You are living your life,
making your choices.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.682
If you choose to let me
be part of your life,

38:13.726 --> 38:15.293
I would welcome that
with open arms.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.773
I am saddled with
responsibilities

38:17.817 --> 38:19.471
that you cannot
possibly fathom.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.777
The safety of the nation.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.127
And every one of our
neighbors wants us dead.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.477
I don'’t have the luxury

38:25.520 --> 38:28.784
of allowing my feelings
to dictate my actions.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.309
You do not have any feelings.

38:31.352 --> 38:32.745
I have no feelings?

38:36.749 --> 38:39.447
There was a time, Ziva,

38:39.491 --> 38:41.928
when I was quite different.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.973
When my house was filled

38:44.017 --> 38:46.541
with the sound
of children laughing.

38:46.585 --> 38:50.589
You and Ari and Tali.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.549
There was a time, Ziva.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.858
Yes.

39:10.086 --> 39:12.437
His heart is hidden
for a reason.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.401
Anybody got anything?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.578
Nothing yet, boss.

39:23.622 --> 39:24.927
Keep looking.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.320
McGEE:
On it, boss.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.018
If El Masri set up
any attack positions,

39:29.062 --> 39:30.498
we'll find them.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.590
Malachi, you notice
that laundry van

39:35.634 --> 39:37.549
that'’s been parked
there forever?

39:43.729 --> 39:45.644
McGEE:
Uh, boss...

39:45.687 --> 39:48.777
we found El Masri'’s

39:48.821 --> 39:51.345
fixed remote gun position.

39:55.436 --> 39:56.742
This is sloppy.

39:56.785 --> 39:59.179
He had to know we'’d
make a perimeter sweep.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.833
Yeah.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.704
McGEE [over comm]:
Ziva, divert your approach

40:02.748 --> 40:03.879
to the service entrance.

40:03.923 --> 40:05.141
Copy that, McGee.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.187
Diverting to secondary.

40:09.189 --> 40:11.452
Most fathers teach
their daughters how to drive.

40:11.496 --> 40:12.627
I have you to
blame for this?

40:12.671 --> 40:13.933
This she learned
from her mother.

40:24.247 --> 40:27.468
Is this the only alternative?

40:27.512 --> 40:29.078
It is now.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.449
Get back!

40:54.060 --> 40:55.104
Move! Move!

40:57.977 --> 41:00.240
Stay down! Move back!

41:01.197 --> 41:03.373
Get him to the safe house!

41:03.417 --> 41:05.158
Ziva!
Now!

41:05.201 --> 41:06.986
Move!

41:10.119 --> 41:13.209
[whirring, powering down]

41:15.560 --> 41:16.778
Get in! Get in! Let'’s go!

41:21.217 --> 41:22.480
[engine revs, tires screech]

41:36.145 --> 41:38.713
[car alarms wailing,
people clamoring]

41:54.033 --> 41:55.556
What the heck'’s
going on out there?

41:55.600 --> 41:56.818
Sounds like
World War III.

41:56.862 --> 41:58.559
Okay, everyone,
just calm down.

41:58.603 --> 42:00.909
We are calm.
You'’re yelling.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.998
There was a... threat.

42:03.042 --> 42:05.610
It has been assessed,
confronted, and dealt with.

42:05.653 --> 42:07.220
In a fashion.

42:07.263 --> 42:10.049
Son, we'’ve all been
behind the curtain.

42:10.092 --> 42:12.660
We-We know how it goes.

42:12.704 --> 42:14.793
Dead bad guy.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.011
The end.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.622
Okay, then.

42:17.665 --> 42:19.188
I don'’t think a
round of applause

42:19.232 --> 42:20.538
would be too out of line.

42:23.062 --> 42:24.629
It'’s a joke.

42:24.672 --> 42:27.501
Agent Gibbs,
everything secure?

42:27.545 --> 42:29.242
Yeah. Hadar, report.

42:29.285 --> 42:30.417
You okay?

42:30.460 --> 42:31.766
Fine.

42:37.076 --> 42:39.034
Hadar, come in.

42:39.078 --> 42:40.558
They should be back at
the safehouse by now.

42:44.083 --> 42:46.476
Hadar, acknowledge.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.348
GIBBS:
Leon?

42:48.391 --> 42:51.177
Are you there?

42:51.220 --> 42:53.135
Anyone?

42:59.228 --> 43:00.708
Eli?

43:00.752 --> 43:03.102
What's happened?
