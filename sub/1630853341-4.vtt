(turn signal clicking)

00:16.474 --> 00:18.059
(Jean speaking French)

00:26.735 --> 00:30.822
(Sophie speaking French)

00:31.489 --> 00:33.575
(Jean speaking French)

00:33.658 --> 00:34.743
(Sophie speaking French)

00:41.040 --> 00:41.541
(both chuckle)

00:41.624 --> 00:44.085
(Jean speaking French)

00:44.169 --> 00:44.210
Sophie:<i> Okay.</i>

00:49.507 --> 00:50.884
Jean:
<i>I know you've been reluctant</i>

00:50.967 --> 00:52.343
<i>to speak on camera about</i>

00:52.427 --> 00:54.679
<i>your relationship</i>
<i>with Michael until now.</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:56.639
<i>So thank you.</i>

00:56.723 --> 00:58.516
Sophie:<i> Of course.</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:00.435
Jean:<i> How long</i>
<i>have you been together?</i>

01:00.518 --> 01:02.395
Hm... 12 years.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.731
Right after the trial ended.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.192
Jean:
How did you meet?

01:07.275 --> 01:08.735
Well...

01:13.198 --> 01:14.115
Hm...

01:15.700 --> 01:17.577
C-Can we start with
something else?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.454
Okay, let's start with today.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.791
Do you think today is proof

01:22.874 --> 01:25.835
that the justice system works?

01:28.004 --> 01:29.380
It's hard to say.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.054
What is justice?

01:36.137 --> 01:36.805
Jim Hardin:
<i>I've said from day one</i>

01:36.888 --> 01:39.307
<i>that it can only be one thing.</i>

01:39.390 --> 01:43.394
(speaking French)

01:51.069 --> 01:53.279
Sonya Pfeiffer:
<i>This is Sonya Pfeiffer</i>
<i>for ABC 11 News.</i>

01:53.363 --> 01:54.989
<i>It's been a long and winding</i>
<i>journey, but we're here.</i>

01:55.073 --> 01:58.159
<i>Day one of</i>
<i>the Michael Peterson trial.</i>

01:58.243 --> 01:59.410
<i>A year and a--</i>

01:59.494 --> 02:00.995
Sophie:
<i>A trial's simply two sides</i>

02:01.079 --> 02:03.248
<i>competing to tell</i>
<i>a better story.</i>

02:03.331 --> 02:04.666
Jim:
<i>We're gonna contend to you</i>

02:04.749 --> 02:07.085
<i>that after a vicious argument</i>
<i>with his wife,</i>

02:07.168 --> 02:11.422
<i>Michael Peterson</i>
<i>murdered Kathleen</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:14.592
<i>in cold blood,</i>
<i>beating her in the head...</i>

02:16.594 --> 02:17.929
<i>with this.</i>

02:19.055 --> 02:20.849
David Rudolf:
<i>And where is this</i>

02:20.932 --> 02:23.184
<i>elusive murder weapon?</i>

02:23.268 --> 02:28.022
<i>They can't find it</i>
<i>because it doesn't exist.</i>

02:28.106 --> 02:32.443
<i>The fact of the matter is,</i>
<i>Kathleen had some wine,</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:35.697
<i>some champagne,</i>
<i>and some Valium</i>

02:36.155 --> 02:37.699
<i>and fell.</i>

02:37.782 --> 02:39.868
Sophie:
<i>And 12 jurors declare</i>

02:39.951 --> 02:40.952
<i>one of the stories</i> <i>the winne.</i>

02:41.035 --> 02:44.205
<i>And that story</i>
<i>becomes justice.</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:46.207
<i>And what sort of</i>
<i>sexual activities</i>

02:46.291 --> 02:48.293
<i>would you perform for men</i>

02:48.376 --> 02:49.168
<i>that you might</i>
<i>have been prepared</i>

02:49.252 --> 02:52.297
<i>to perform</i>
<i>with Michael Peterson?</i>

02:52.380 --> 02:55.508
<i>I mean, pretty much</i>
<i>anything under the sun.</i>

03:07.937 --> 03:10.106
<i>I mean, pretty much</i>
<i>anything under the sun.</i>

03:12.817 --> 03:15.069
<i>Is it fair to say</i>
<i>the men you serviced</i>

03:15.153 --> 03:19.741
<i>were bisexual as opposed</i>
<i>to being homosexual?</i>

03:19.824 --> 03:22.201
<i>I'd go so far</i>
<i>as to say that they were</i>

03:22.285 --> 03:23.161
<i>mostly straight married guys</i>

03:23.244 --> 03:26.998
<i>with some minor</i>
<i>homosexual tendencies.</i>

03:29.167 --> 03:33.755
Jim:
<i>Can you identify state's</i>
<i>exhibit 72 for me, please?</i>

03:33.838 --> 03:37.258
Candace:
<i>Yes, that is my...</i>
<i>blow poke.</i>

03:38.009 --> 03:41.095
(blows)<i> You blow through it.</i>

03:41.179 --> 03:42.931
Jim:
<i>And you gave one</i>
<i>of these blow pokes</i>

03:43.014 --> 03:44.265
<i>to every member</i>
<i>of your family?</i>

03:44.349 --> 03:48.186
(clears throat)<i> Yes.</i>
<i>For Christmas of 1984.</i>

03:48.269 --> 03:49.145
Jim:
<i>Including Kathleen?</i>

03:49.228 --> 03:52.815
<i>Yes. She was not only</i>
<i>my older sister,</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:56.235
<i>but she was</i> <i>my best friend.</i>

03:56.319 --> 03:58.154
<i>You did state to police</i>

03:58.237 --> 04:00.990
<i>the only relationship</i> <i>you saw</i>

04:01.074 --> 04:03.868
<i>between Michael</i> <i>and Kathleen</i>

04:03.952 --> 04:06.829
<i>was a "truly loving,</i>

04:06.913 --> 04:09.832
<i>respectful marriage."</i>

04:09.916 --> 04:10.792
<i>Right?</i>

04:10.875 --> 04:12.961
Candace:<i> That was</i>
<i>an old version of me.</i>

04:13.044 --> 04:14.337
<i>The new informed me,</i>

04:14.420 --> 04:16.297
<i>the me sitting here</i>
<i>in this courtroom,</i>

04:16.381 --> 04:20.134
<i>can confidently say</i>
<i>that I have no idea</i>

04:20.218 --> 04:23.054
<i>who the hell</i>
<i>Michael Peterson was then</i>

04:23.137 --> 04:24.013
<i>or is now.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:25.348
<i>Does that</i> <i>clear it up for yo?</i>

04:27.058 --> 04:28.726
Sophie:
<i>Justice is a, is a construct</i>

04:28.810 --> 04:31.854
<i>little more than a game,</i>

04:31.938 --> 04:36.192
<i>a game that shapes</i>
<i>the outcome of a man's life.</i>

04:36.275 --> 04:39.153
<i>As for what's</i>
<i>happening today,</i>

04:39.237 --> 04:41.364
<i>this feels</i>
<i>bigger</i> <i>than justice.</i>

04:42.573 --> 04:44.200
<i>I would say, um,</i> <i>it's fate.</i>

04:47.912 --> 04:50.456
Jim:
<i>You've got cast-off</i>
<i>outside the header</i>

04:50.540 --> 04:51.874
<i>and on the west wall</i>
<i>of the hallway.</i>

04:51.958 --> 04:54.085
<i>How could that happen?</i>

04:54.168 --> 04:55.211
<i>The assailant was standing</i>

04:55.294 --> 04:57.839
<i>on the outside</i>
<i>of the stairwell,</i>

04:57.922 --> 05:00.174
<i>swingin' the weapon...</i>

05:05.013 --> 05:08.266
and creating this

05:08.349 --> 05:10.435
blood cast-off pattern.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.855
Jim:
So to be clear, in your opinion,

05:13.938 --> 05:16.399
this had to have been a beating?

05:16.482 --> 05:17.650
Duane Deaver:
That's correct.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.235
The impact spatter

05:19.318 --> 05:23.156
on the inside
of the defendant's shorts

05:23.239 --> 05:24.240
simply does not occur

05:24.323 --> 05:28.244
unless he's standing
over her as he strikes.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.829
And that's consistent
with crime scenes

05:29.912 --> 05:32.457
you've overseen in the past?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.083
Duane:
This is extremely consistent.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.961
Jim:
And why should we trust you?

05:37.045 --> 05:41.049
Well, sir, I've written
over 200 bloodstain reports

05:41.132 --> 05:44.719
and overseen... 500 scenes.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.429
That guy looks like a penis.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.765
(snickers)

05:48.848 --> 05:51.225
Jim:
No further questions,
Your Honor.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.393
-Judge Hudson:
You may be dismissed.
-(cell phone buzzing)

05:52.477 --> 05:55.021
-Let's take a 10-minute recess.
-Todd Peterson: Jesus.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.899
It looks bad on TV, dude.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.025
Todd: (over phone)
<i>What do I keep telling you?</i>

05:59.108 --> 06:01.652
<i>Do not watch that shit.</i>

06:01.736 --> 06:03.446
Yeah, but the commentators
are saying--

06:03.529 --> 06:06.866
Hey, listen to what I am saying.

06:06.949 --> 06:07.784
I am sitting here
where it's real.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.661
We gotta get going.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.206
Todd:
<i>Things are going great.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

06:13.289 --> 06:14.582
<i>When Radisch takes</i> <i>the stand,</i>
<i>things are gonna go our way.</i>

06:14.665 --> 06:18.753
Yeah, look, I--
I just really feel like
I should be there.

06:18.836 --> 06:19.921
Clay, hold on.
Hold on one second.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.840
Alright.
I'm headed back to Reno.

06:22.924 --> 06:23.966
I'll see you in
a week and a half.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.343
Clayton: Todd!

06:27.095 --> 06:27.303
Todd.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.852
David:
So... tomorrow is huge.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.189
They're going big,
showing these autopsy photos.

06:38.272 --> 06:41.859
So we really need
everyone there.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.319
Arm-in-arm. United front.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.659
I can't go. I'm sorry. I can't.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.621
Okay, I hear that. I do.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.706
And no one's going to force you.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.916
Of course,
you're going to force me.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.710
That's what
this meeting is about.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.462
I mean,
would anyone really notice

07:01.546 --> 07:02.630
if she wasn't there?

07:02.713 --> 07:03.548
(footsteps approaching)

07:03.631 --> 07:08.010
Um, I mean, maybe
10, 15 years ago, no.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.428
But, you know, now there's...

07:11.639 --> 07:12.765
cameras everywhere.

07:12.849 --> 07:13.516
Everyone sees everything.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.476
So...

07:16.686 --> 07:18.980
if you're absent
and Caitlin is there...

07:19.063 --> 07:20.982
Optics aren't great.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.818
Todd:
I mean, Clayton's been
asking to come home.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.863
-You know, maybe he should--
-No, no, no.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.198
No, not for this.
Just keep pushing him off.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.616
Todd: Okay.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.451
Well, maybe Martha could take

07:32.535 --> 07:35.621
one of Kathleen's Valium,
you know.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.457
-Or just a half.
-Martha: No. No!
I'm not going to go.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.668
I'm not going.
I'm not going
to sit there and watch.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.003
I'm not going to do it.

07:42.086 --> 07:42.837
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm not going.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.463
I'm not going.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.007
Freda Black:
State your name and profession

07:46.090 --> 07:48.634
for the court, please.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.387
My name is
Dr. Deborah L. Radisch.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.055
I'm a forensic pathologist

07:53.139 --> 07:54.223
and the associate
chief medical examiner

07:54.307 --> 07:56.684
for the state of North Carolina.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.562
And you performed the autopsy
on Kathleen Peterson?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.813
Dr. Radisch:
That is correct.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.023
Freda:
If it pleases the court,

08:02.106 --> 08:05.359
I'd like to display
exhibit 79a and 79b,

08:05.443 --> 08:07.653
in a large format
for easy viewing.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.699
These images are... graphic.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.160
Judge Hudson: Proceed.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.620
I think I'm going
to have a panic attack.

08:17.496 --> 08:21.250
(heavy breathing)

08:27.965 --> 08:29.383
(spectators murmuring)

08:35.014 --> 08:38.726
(speaking French)

08:38.809 --> 08:40.269
Yeah...

08:50.029 --> 08:51.572
(spectators gasping)

08:54.033 --> 08:55.076
(sniffles)

08:55.159 --> 08:57.495
-Can't we object?
-Shh.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.580
-David, stop her--
-Not now.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.500
Freda: Dr. Radisch,

09:02.583 --> 09:04.669
you ruled Kathleen's death
a homicide.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.420
I did.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.964
From blunt force trauma
to the head.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.924
(panting)

09:10.007 --> 09:11.968
You think
the fractured cartilage

09:12.051 --> 09:14.428
in Kathleen's thyroid indicates

09:14.512 --> 09:17.807
that a strangulation attempt
is merely possible?

09:17.890 --> 09:19.267
It's more than possible.
It's probable.

09:19.350 --> 09:24.063
But your report said
it was only,

09:24.146 --> 09:27.984
what, suggestive of
a strangulation attempt?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.945
I would say it was
highly, highly likely

09:31.028 --> 09:33.531
an attempt
at strangulation was made.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.909
But can you say that
with a reasonable degree

09:36.993 --> 09:38.786
of medical certainty?

09:38.869 --> 09:41.080
Yes. Yes, I can.

09:41.163 --> 09:44.125
Okay. Then would you say
with a reasonable degree

09:44.208 --> 09:48.963
of medical certainty that
Kathleen Peterson was killed

09:49.046 --> 09:51.465
by blunt force trauma
to the head?

09:51.549 --> 09:52.508
Yes.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.761
-Okay. May I approach?
-Judge Hudson: Yes.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.558
I just want to put
these binders up here.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.768
-Ms. Radisch.
-Dr. Radisch.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.895
Forgive me, Dr. Radisch.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.106
Um, I want you to tell me

10:07.189 --> 10:10.151
if, um, these appear
to be a collection

10:10.234 --> 10:11.819
of all the autopsies

10:11.902 --> 10:15.573
involving blunt force trauma
to the head in North Carolina

10:15.656 --> 10:18.617
from 1991 to 2003.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.994
Objection.

10:20.077 --> 10:20.828
Overruled.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.997
She may respond
however she'd like.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.498
(scoffs)

10:27.335 --> 10:30.212
I don't think I can give you
an accurate answer to that.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.505
-Not today.
-David: Alright.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.593
Alright. Well, we went back
at least a decade

10:35.676 --> 10:40.389
and pulled the case files
for every beating death

10:40.473 --> 10:42.558
in the state of North Carolina.

10:42.641 --> 10:46.020
Two hundred fifty-seven,
to be precise,

10:46.103 --> 10:49.398
and found that in every case,

10:50.274 --> 10:53.444
whether the object was hollow

10:53.861 --> 10:54.987
or hard

10:55.071 --> 10:57.198
or thin or heavy,

10:57.281 --> 11:00.034
every single time,

11:01.410 --> 11:04.580
the beating resulted
in either a skull fracture

11:04.663 --> 11:07.541
or massive injury to the brain.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.294
In many cases, it was both.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.797
Are you aware of this?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.173
No. Because like I said,

11:14.256 --> 11:16.008
I haven't had a chance
to review these--

11:16.092 --> 11:18.094
Alright.
Well, let's, let's just assume

22:57.000 --> 22:59.628
Freda: Was there blood?

22:59.711 --> 23:01.755
Oh yes. Everywhere.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.591
The floor.
The walls. The stairs.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.177
Freda: (sighs)
Blood everywhere.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.221
What did you do next?

23:09.304 --> 23:11.556
Well, my first concern

23:11.640 --> 23:13.266
was for Martha-Baby
and Little Gee-Gee.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.310
I loved these
little girls so much.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.273
I... I went upstairs
and got them.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.943
-Freda: And then what?
-I made sure they were okay.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.278
And then I went
to the toilet and vomited.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.575
Ease up.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.535
And after that?

23:31.618 --> 23:34.704
Agnes:
I went and got
Michael next door.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.289
He came in, took a look around,

23:36.373 --> 23:41.086
and said that Liz
had a brain aneurysm

23:41.169 --> 23:44.256
and that she must have fallen
down the stairs from that.

23:44.339 --> 23:47.384
And had anyone with
any medical authority arrived

23:47.467 --> 23:50.095
who could verify
this guess of his?

23:50.178 --> 23:54.432
No. Michael sort of
proclaimed it.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.309
And... and then it was true.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.979
That's when I started
getting a feeling.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.982
What sort of feeling?

24:02.065 --> 24:03.942
That Michael had done
something horrible.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.319
David:
Objection. Speculation.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.988
Judge Hudson: Sustained.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.031
Tom Maher:
Ms. Schafer,

24:10.115 --> 24:11.324
in your statement
to German police,

24:11.408 --> 24:13.869
you never mentioned
the blood or the vomit

24:13.952 --> 24:17.581
or any suspicions at all

24:17.664 --> 24:18.999
against Michael Peterson.
Why is that?

24:19.082 --> 24:21.751
I'm not sure I understand.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.670
Tom:
Well, if you didn't mention
anything at the time

24:23.753 --> 24:27.174
and there are no photographs
to corroborate,

24:27.257 --> 24:28.049
I'm just wondering
how you could be sure

24:28.133 --> 24:30.093
any of this happened at all.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.596
Agnes:
Well, that's easy.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.515
When I saw the reports
about Kathleen,

24:35.599 --> 24:39.311
Liz's death started coming
back to me in flashbacks.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.605
Right, and-- I'm sorry.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.982
You've been having flashbacks?

24:44.065 --> 24:44.566
Yes.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.154
They come in short scenes,
they're very vivid.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.201
Um... (clears throat)

24:54.284 --> 24:55.368
Just to be clear,
you-you're referring

24:55.452 --> 24:59.831
to these mental images
as... flashbacks

24:59.915 --> 25:02.167
and not actual memories.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.168
Yes.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.045
Tom:
Hmm. Isn't it also true

25:05.128 --> 25:06.755
that you remained employed

25:06.838 --> 25:09.716
by Michael Peterson
for the period of a year

25:09.799 --> 25:12.260
following the event?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.554
Isn't that a questionable thing
to do if you thought
he was a murderer?

25:14.638 --> 25:16.598
But that's why I did it.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.058
I wanted to keep an eye on them.

25:18.141 --> 25:21.895
Michael was very strict
with the boys.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.522
-Tom: Alright, well,
let's stay on topic.
-Agnes: I am.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.359
I stayed because I didn't want
the same for the girls.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.778
-David: Objection, Your Honor.
-I failed.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.988
I should have
protected you, Martha-Baby.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.448
I should have
protected you from him.

25:33.531 --> 25:34.699
David:
Your Honor, move to strike.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.326
(reporters clamoring)

25:36.409 --> 25:38.536
David:
Get to the car.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.122
(clamoring continues)

25:41.206 --> 25:43.583
Mr. Peterson, did you beat
your baby daughter in Germany?

25:43.667 --> 25:46.253
Mr. Peterson,
just one question. Tell us...

25:46.336 --> 25:48.421

-Todd: Open up!

26:07.440 --> 26:09.317
Michael: How do I know?

26:09.401 --> 26:10.443
She's a broken woman
who wants her 15 minutes.

26:10.527 --> 26:13.738
She told me the truth.
She said that she loved us.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.032
For Christ's sake.
Now is not the time.

26:16.116 --> 26:16.783
Martha!

26:16.866 --> 26:18.368
Just answer the question.
Please.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.704
I'm telling you,
she's full of crap.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.580

26:22.664 --> 26:23.456
Reporter: Michael!

26:25.875 --> 26:27.168

Reporter: Mr. Peterson.
Mr. Peterson, one question.

<i>Now about subjectivity,</i>

<i>that threaten our own?</i>

27:00.618 --> 27:03.872

27:32.650 --> 27:33.443

34:45.708 --> 34:47.585
Michael:
No, the jury.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.670
Now, it's, it's my life
on the line here.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.048
And I want to tell my story.

34:52.131 --> 34:55.176
You know, tell them
how much I loved Kathleen.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.470
You know, I deserve
to be heard here, don't I?

34:57.553 --> 34:58.471
-Yeah. Dad's right.
-Clayton.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.389
-No, he deserves to talk.
-Come on. Come on.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.182
-He's the one on trial.
-Listen!

35:03.100 --> 35:05.978
Listen. I hear what
you're saying, Mike.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.063
I do.

35:07.146 --> 35:09.649
I-- just listen
to me for a second.

35:09.732 --> 35:13.694
I know how nerves can flare up
at the eleventh hour.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.030
But we cannot let them
take the wheel.

35:18.491 --> 35:21.577
Your case is strong.
We just have to stay calm.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.037
See it through to the end.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.838
(engine cranking)

35:31.921 --> 35:35.174
(heavy metal music playing)

35:35.258 --> 35:37.885
Clayton:
Come on, motherfucker!
Come on!

35:37.969 --> 35:39.679
(engine sputters)

35:39.762 --> 35:43.391
(music continues)

35:48.271 --> 35:49.313
Come on!

35:49.397 --> 35:51.357
(engine revving)

35:51.440 --> 35:53.901
Yes! (laughing)

35:55.361 --> 35:58.865
(engine sputters, shuts off)

36:00.908 --> 36:01.158
Fuck me!

36:03.369 --> 36:07.331
♪ ♪

36:12.712 --> 36:14.505
(muttering)

36:14.589 --> 36:15.631
I found it. I found it.

36:15.715 --> 36:16.173
I found it.
I found it. I found it.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.094
I found it!

36:21.971 --> 36:25.933
I found the fucking blow poke!

36:26.017 --> 36:27.226
Todd:
Clayton, don't fuck
with us right now.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.103
-Seriously, don't fuck with us.
-I am "us."

36:29.186 --> 36:30.646
Why would I fuck with us?

36:30.730 --> 36:32.607
I found it right there
just like that.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.401
You found it right there
because you fucking
planted it right there.

36:35.484 --> 36:36.319
What? I didn't plant it!

36:36.402 --> 36:37.737
Jesus! What the fuck
is wrong with you?

36:37.820 --> 36:39.071
This is a good thing.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.451
It's not like
there's blood on it.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.121
Of course, there's
no fucking blood on it.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.833
You know what?
This is so classic you.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.543
You come home
out of nowhere and you come
and you fuck up our shit.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.378
Would you both just shut up!

36:55.713 --> 36:56.881
Just shut up.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.303
I mean, I don't believe it.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.098
How many times
did they search this place?

37:10.353 --> 37:11.479
I should call Dave, right?

37:16.525 --> 37:17.693
Dad?

37:22.615 --> 37:23.199
She must have put it there.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.996
David:
<i>Look, Mike, the thing's intact.</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:30.331
There's no blood.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.250
This could be good,

37:33.334 --> 37:34.001
provided you're telling
the truth.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.379
Well, of course, I am. Jesus!

37:36.462 --> 37:39.966
Alright, so we hold
all the cards here, right?

37:40.049 --> 37:41.717
This works for us.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.553
The DA says the blow poke's
the murder weapon.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.263
We prove him wrong.
It's right here.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.015
It's fucking clean.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.600
What else are they wrong about?

37:49.934 --> 37:51.519
Right?

37:52.853 --> 37:54.480
Tom:
Now, if you can answer
these next ones

37:54.563 --> 37:56.440
just as truthfully as you can.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.734
Alright? Because if we
put you on the stand

37:58.818 --> 38:00.528
to say how you found
the blow poke,

38:00.611 --> 38:04.323
Hardin will zero in
on any uncertainty,

38:04.407 --> 38:06.367
any, um, evasion.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.369
Right. Of course. You got it.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.662
Okay.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.414
Alright.

38:11.497 --> 38:14.417
So I understand you have a DUI

38:14.500 --> 38:15.626
on your record, is that right?

38:17.044 --> 38:19.130
Two DUIs?

38:19.213 --> 38:22.508
Good. Uh, always be honest.
Don't let him catch you lying.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.176
Alright.

38:24.260 --> 38:28.556
Uh, April 1994, you were
a sophomore in college.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.933
Got in a little trouble,
is that right?

38:31.017 --> 38:34.103
Yep. Went on spring break.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.188
Tom: Right.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.025
And, uh, how much
prison time ultimately

38:39.108 --> 38:41.235
did you end up
spending for planting

38:41.318 --> 38:42.403
those pipe bombs in Duke?

38:45.781 --> 38:47.033
Well, they didn't go off.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.242
To be fair,
they weren't designed to.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.201
They were just like a diversion

38:49.285 --> 38:52.079
so I could get
to the laminating machine.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.456
Wait, the laminating machine?

38:53.539 --> 38:54.832
-Here we go.
-Yeah.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.460
To make fake IDs

38:57.543 --> 39:00.087
to get beers for me
and my buddies.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.799
But it was... uh, four years.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.177
All told, four years
in Fed for the bombs.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.846
It wouldn't have been that long
except they found more
here in my room.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.347
-Tom: More bombs?
-(Martha and Margaret snicker)

39:12.099 --> 39:14.393
Do, do we really need
an audience?

39:14.477 --> 39:17.188
Tom:
Uh, well, you're going
to have one in court.

39:17.271 --> 39:19.899
My son is finishing
his second master's in May.

39:19.982 --> 39:20.441
Computer engineering.

39:22.359 --> 39:24.528
That's great.
Turning over a new leaf.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.908
But, um, while we are
still on the old one,

39:30.326 --> 39:34.038
I need to ask you
about July 4th, 2001.

39:34.121 --> 39:37.083
Oh yeah.
I, I was drunk, I guess.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.086
And me and Becky had a fight.
She called the cops.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.297
Because?

39:46.300 --> 39:47.593
You hit her, correct?

39:47.676 --> 39:49.053
(scoffs)

39:51.013 --> 39:52.348
We had a fight,
and I shoved her once.

39:52.431 --> 39:56.143
Not hit. She called the cops,
but she forgave me.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.645
-We're, we're engaged now.
-Todd: H-h-hang on.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.980
Tom, h-how can they
even bring that in?

40:01.524 --> 40:05.444
Uh, look, they get a whiff
of domestic violence,

40:05.528 --> 40:08.697
this could be
a real issue for us,

40:08.781 --> 40:10.116
given what Agnes has alleged.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.451
Victims often become
the abusers.

40:12.535 --> 40:16.831
Right? They'll ask,
did your father ever hit you?

40:16.914 --> 40:19.208
-What?
-Ever hit Kathleen?

40:19.291 --> 40:21.836
Clayton:
No, my dad never hit anyone.
I would have seen.

40:21.919 --> 40:22.795
Okay, but maybe there
are things that happened

40:22.878 --> 40:24.713
in this house
that you don't know about.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.219
You're aware that the state
has pornographic photos

40:30.302 --> 40:33.973
and videos
from your dad's computer.

40:34.056 --> 40:37.059
Did you know anything
about that prior to the trial?

40:37.143 --> 40:40.646
Uh, about any of what?
Can you be more specific?

40:40.729 --> 40:42.356
Tom: Uh, his sexuality.

40:42.439 --> 40:43.691
Clayton: Oh, well...

40:45.609 --> 40:47.903
he's a pretty sexual person.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.905
I was always jealous of him
and Kathleen's sex life.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.282
Ew! Oh my God.

40:51.365 --> 40:52.908
Jesus Christ, Clayton.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.660
What, Todd?
Nothing but the truth.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.996
Okay. R-right.
Uh, specifically,

40:57.079 --> 40:58.956
were you aware
of his interest in men?

41:03.002 --> 41:04.420
I-I mean,
we never talked about it.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.425
Because a son's role is not
to question his father, right?

41:10.593 --> 41:12.428
But I walked in on him
jacking off once

41:12.511 --> 41:15.556
to something kind of gay.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.684
-Patty Peterson: What?
-Petersons are fucking crazy.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.227
What do you mean, the Petersons?

41:20.311 --> 41:21.228
I mean, you and Todd and Dad.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.148
Like, why can't you guys
just be normal?

41:24.231 --> 41:26.025
Margie, can you keep
your little sister in check?

41:26.108 --> 41:27.735
No, she's right. I'm sick
of defending you guys, too.

41:27.818 --> 41:31.739
Oh, really? Really.
You're going to say that
in front of our mother?

41:31.822 --> 41:33.532
Our mother, that took
you in off the street.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.618
Margaret:
Well, all you do
is hit her up for money.

41:35.701 --> 41:36.410
You guys make everything worse.

41:36.493 --> 41:39.371
You rack up debt.
You embarrass us.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.456
-I mean,
how are we supposed to--
-Hey!

41:43.125 --> 41:45.085
I run a successful website.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.880
You sound like a psychopath!

41:47.963 --> 41:52.092
(Patty muttering)

41:52.176 --> 41:53.052
(indistinct chatter)

41:53.135 --> 41:55.554
I beg your pardon, Michael.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.016
It's the children.

41:59.099 --> 42:01.518
You'd be in some fucked-up
German brothel right now, okay?

42:01.602 --> 42:04.396
(all shouting)

42:04.480 --> 42:06.565
-Michael: Hey!
-I said, be quiet!

42:06.649 --> 42:08.567
That's enough!

42:12.988 --> 42:14.240
Clay's not testifying.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.867
-But, Dad--
-Forget it!

42:16.951 --> 42:21.789
If anyone is going to testify
about this fucking blow poke,

42:21.872 --> 42:25.459
it's going to be me!
And I am going to testify.

42:25.542 --> 42:27.253
For the good of my case,
for the good of this family.

42:27.336 --> 42:30.297
And before we all
fucking kill each other.

42:41.517 --> 42:44.436
Should have just stayed
in Baltimore.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.729
(door shuts)

42:47.815 --> 42:48.524
(knocking on door)

42:52.569 --> 42:55.239
No use trying, David.
My mind's made up.

42:55.322 --> 42:56.115
David: Uh-huh.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.200
Well, maybe you're right.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.661
Can we talk it through?

43:01.870 --> 43:05.416
They are going to ask you

43:05.499 --> 43:07.543
about the Purple Heart

43:08.544 --> 43:10.838
to establish a pattern of lying.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.256
Well, I...

43:13.048 --> 43:14.174
it's true, I lied about that.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.886
About being injured in Vietnam.

43:17.970 --> 43:22.433
And you told everyone,
including Kathleen,

43:22.516 --> 43:25.769
that for your bravery,
you earned a Purple Heart?

43:26.979 --> 43:29.106
Why, Mike?

43:29.857 --> 43:30.649
Because...

43:32.651 --> 43:33.736
I was injured,

43:35.029 --> 43:35.946
just not in the war.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.615
It was afterward.

43:38.699 --> 43:41.368
A car accident when
I was stationed in Japan.

43:42.411 --> 43:45.039
But I do have a Silver Star.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.166
And a Bronze Star, with valor,

43:47.249 --> 43:50.336
because... once...

43:52.254 --> 43:55.215
a marine in my command
was blown up by a grenade.

43:57.092 --> 44:00.179
(paper rustling)

44:01.096 --> 44:02.181
Here.

44:03.557 --> 44:03.640
John Cuddy.

44:09.938 --> 44:12.149
We were close.

44:12.232 --> 44:13.650
I dragged his mutilated body
back to the foxhole.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.325
He died in my arms.

44:23.452 --> 44:23.744
So did Kathleen.

44:30.292 --> 44:32.461
You learn CPR
in the military, don't you?

44:33.337 --> 44:35.214
Yes.

44:35.297 --> 44:37.341
Well, when you
first called 911...

44:38.634 --> 44:42.262
you said Kathleen
was still breathing.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.350
Then you called back

44:46.433 --> 44:47.976
a couple minutes later,
said she wasn't.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.561
In between, did you perform CPR?

44:50.979 --> 44:51.980
No.

44:52.815 --> 44:55.150
-No. I was in shock.
-Shock?

44:57.236 --> 44:59.196
Vietnam vet.

44:59.279 --> 45:00.739
Bunch of different colored stars

45:00.823 --> 45:03.075
and obviously saw combat.

45:03.158 --> 45:04.785
You went into shock?

45:07.996 --> 45:10.874
It wasn't like war.
It wasn't like anything.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.335
It was just,

45:13.419 --> 45:14.461
just her...

45:16.004 --> 45:17.297
in pain...

45:19.049 --> 45:20.884
leaving me...

45:23.470 --> 45:24.888
and me begging her not to go

45:24.972 --> 45:27.433
and... she wouldn't listen.

45:30.185 --> 45:30.644
It was the worst moment
of my life.

45:34.064 --> 45:35.399
I believe you, Mike.

45:36.942 --> 45:39.611
But how does a jury know

45:39.695 --> 45:42.239
it's not just
another Purple Heart?

45:45.367 --> 45:46.869
Not just another lie.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.539
I want to leave it
up to you, I do.

45:50.622 --> 45:52.040
I mean, it's your life.

45:52.124 --> 45:54.460
But I can get the blow poke in

45:54.543 --> 45:55.544
without putting you
or Clay on the stand,

45:55.627 --> 45:58.714
and your case
won't suffer for it.

45:58.797 --> 45:59.756
But if I don't tell them...

46:02.593 --> 46:03.886
how will they know?

46:13.061 --> 46:14.438
Let me know what you decide.

46:24.573 --> 46:24.865
Dad.

46:27.784 --> 46:28.952
It's fine, Clay.

46:38.003 --> 46:38.879
Reporter:<i> A coup</i>
<i>for the defense today</i>

46:38.962 --> 46:40.672
