WEBVTT

00:19.769 --> 00:20.687
Rex?

00:27.819 --> 00:31.239
Jesus, Anna,
when are you not hallucinating?

00:38.705 --> 00:39.789
You're here.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.126
That happened.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.086
Are you disappointed?

00:45.837 --> 00:47.630
No. I've just

00:49.132 --> 00:51.301
never been with a bad boy before.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.472
Well, I've never been
with a good girl before.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.516
But I think I could get used to it.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.773
Let me know if you want sugar.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.108
I know exactly where you keep it.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.321
What you making?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.739
French omelets.

01:12.822 --> 01:15.200
The secret is how you whisk the eggs.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.410
-Everyone whisks their eggs too fast.
-Hmm.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.704
But you gotta take your time,

01:19.788 --> 01:24.542
and then you gotta cook it low and slow.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.002
Hmm.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.005
Hmm.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.467
Do you do everything low and slow?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.470
What does that mean?

01:35.553 --> 01:36.513
Hmm?

01:36.596 --> 01:39.140
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I'm not good at sexy talk.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.854
Well, you're good at being sexy.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.237
Do not go anywhere.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.836
Get down! Get on the ground!

02:07.919 --> 02:09.337
-What are you doing?
-What's going on?

02:09.420 --> 02:11.589
You're under arrest
for the murder of Chastity Linkous.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.882
What are you talking about?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.969
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.095
I didn't do anything.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.972
You have
the right to an attorney.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.766
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.061
Anna. Anna, I didn't do it.
I didn't do anything!

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
Anna, I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.984
He did do it, and you're lucky
he didn't do it to you too.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.630
-Come on.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.309
The Financial Crimes Unit

03:04.392 --> 03:07.145
had Rex and Chastity
under surveillance for months.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.189
They were listening
to all the phone conversations,

03:09.272 --> 03:10.648
trying to build their case,

03:10.732 --> 03:12.901
so when we discovered her body
and ID'd it,

03:13.776 --> 03:15.028
they gave us his location

03:15.111 --> 03:17.989
with instructions
to apprehend him immediately.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.202
I still can't believe he killed her.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.621
Well, let me disabuse you of that notion.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.417
<i>Don't forget whose name</i>
<i>is on those bank accounts, Rex.</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:31.211
<i>Are you threatening me? </i>

03:31.294 --> 03:34.422
<i>Listen, you fucking bitch!</i>
<i>I will not let you take me down.</i>

03:34.505 --> 03:37.217
<i>You got me into this,</i>
<i>and I'm not letting you hang me for it.</i>

03:37.300 --> 03:38.426
<i>You're so tough.</i>

03:38.509 --> 03:41.262
<i>I swear to God, Chastity,</i>
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you.</i>

03:41.346 --> 03:44.182
<i>I'm gonna cut you into little pieces</i>
<i>so they can't find--</i>

03:44.682 --> 03:45.642
Oh my God.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.977
Don't tell anyone I played that for you.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.689
But I wanted you to know the kind of man
you had hidden in your pantry.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.901
Am I in trouble now
for, like, harboring a killer?

03:54.984 --> 03:58.905
You didn't know he was a killer,
so you didn't do anything illegal.

03:58.988 --> 03:59.948
Just stupid.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.909
Playing detective
is a dangerous game, Anna.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.536
And if you'd seen
Chastity's dismembered body,

04:05.620 --> 04:07.288
you'd know just how dangerous.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.334
But why didn't he kill me too?

04:11.417 --> 04:14.295
I told him I saw what happened.
I was a witness.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.713
Well, you're pretty cute, Anna.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.133
Maybe he wanted to roll around in the hay
with you a little bit first.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.845
I made love with a murderer.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.766
A very cold-blooded murderer.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.143
To walk right in that house

04:29.227 --> 04:31.938
with a little girl
and her father right upstairs?

04:32.021 --> 04:33.815
But what about the texts?

04:34.315 --> 04:37.652
He showed me a text
that she sent to him yesterday.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.279
I'm sure he has her phone somewhere.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.699
Texted himself an alibi,
sent all those texts to Neil from Seattle.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.451
What you got?

04:46.202 --> 04:47.954
Okay. I'll come over.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.251
Looks like they found traces of blood
in the floorboards over there.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.296
So, what happens next?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.549
I do my job,
and you get on with your life.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.593
Get on with my life.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.476
How the hell do I do that?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.452
This is a start.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.354
Hey.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.688
<i>Oh good, you're there,</i>

06:37.772 --> 06:39.774
<i>because I have</i>
<i>something exciting to tell you.</i>

06:39.857 --> 06:41.067
Oh. Well, interesting,

06:41.150 --> 06:44.904
because I have something
kind of exciting to tell you as well.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.031
<i>Well, great.</i>
<i>You wanna get a mani-pedi?</i>

06:47.115 --> 06:48.574
Uh, sure. Where are you?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.034
<i>Well, um…</i>

06:51.244 --> 06:53.037
<i>Hey. I'm actually right outside.</i>

06:53.121 --> 06:54.539
-Hi.
-Oh my God.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.041
I dropped by again.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.586
I know. I'm sorry. But I… I called first.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.007
I bet they do a<i> Dateline </i>on it.

07:05.925 --> 07:10.179
Oh no. I… God, I hope not.
I just want things to get back to normal.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.391
You know, whatever normal is.

07:13.474 --> 07:16.394
I don't even know what normal people do.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.105
Like, I assume it's not wake up,

07:19.188 --> 07:22.650
drink wine, and… and stare
out the window for 12 hours.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.737
Well, for me, I mean,
I like to start the day with coffee.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.324
-Uh, coffee, you say?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.869
And then I take a shower.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.872
I'm sorry. You do this every day?

07:35.955 --> 07:36.998
I know.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.332
-Wow.
-I know. Yeah.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.501
-So productive.
-Pretty amazing.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.672
I'm sorry, Sloane.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.090
For what?

07:47.341 --> 07:48.801
I just haven't been a good friend.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.803
-Come on.
-I'm serious.

07:50.887 --> 07:54.849
You stuck by me when I was at my worst,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.602
when a lot of other people
would have left.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.854
A lot of people did leave.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.190
But not you.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.234
You're never getting rid of me.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.155
Okay. So are we done talking
about how you witnessed a murder

08:09.238 --> 08:11.782
and had sex with the murderer?
I'd like to tell you about my thing.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.161
Oh my gosh, was I taking up
all the air space? I'm so sorry.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.371
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but honestly, yeah.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.875
-No. It was a boring story. You go ahead.
-It… I was almost asleep.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.793
-Um…

08:22.877 --> 08:25.087
Okay. So Graham and Prine

08:25.922 --> 08:28.382
is opening a gallery in SoHo.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.594
And they wanna bring somebody on board
to basically run the whole thing.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.764
-They want it to be you?
-Well, no. They want to meet with me.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.100
-Sloane, that's incredible!
-I know. I know.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.020
I… I thought they'd be like, "Honey,
you turned us down once before, so…"

08:41.103 --> 08:42.772
No. They know talent. They know…

08:42.855 --> 08:45.525
Wait. So this might actually happen.
You might be moving to New York?

08:45.608 --> 08:47.443
I mean, I… I don't have the job yet.

08:47.944 --> 08:52.573
But if I do get it, then… I think yes.

08:53.157 --> 08:57.787
Just when I get my life together,
you pick up and move to New York.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.080
Nice.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.833
Didn't you just say,
"Anna, you're never getting rid of me"?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.669
-It's just an expression.
-You didn't…

09:04.752 --> 09:06.128
I didn't mean it. No.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.090
-It's just something you say.
-Oh. My bad, I thought you meant it.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.633
-I did not mean it.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.512
So have you talked to Neil?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.682
-No. I don't know what I'd say.
-Yeah.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.476
Just… I feel so bad for him.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.649
Well, I mean, on the bright side,
he's single now.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.276
Sloane.

09:28.901 --> 09:29.819
What?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.697
Is he not single?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.249
Hey, Buell?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.209
Hi. Sorry.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.044
-I need help getting inside.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.298
I do have my keys,
but, this is ridiculous, um…

09:51.007 --> 09:52.925
…my nails are wet, so…

09:53.009 --> 09:55.678
-Oh. That's no problem, Miss Anna.
-They're just right in there.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.722
-Okay.
-Thank you.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.435
Would you mind opening the door as well?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.816
Promise I'll never get
my nails done again.

10:08.899 --> 10:09.734
Okay.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.155
Thank you.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.991
Buell,

10:17.992 --> 10:18.826
your hand.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.249
Well, I'll be, there's a nail in my hand.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.632
Ugh.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.093
Okay. Uh,
why don't you come inside?

10:36.177 --> 10:39.930
-Are you sure? I don't wanna be a bother.
-It's no bother. Come on inside. Come on.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.603
Shit.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.356
Oh.

10:49.690 --> 10:50.775
Does that hurt?

10:50.858 --> 10:51.692
No, ma'am.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.986
You sure are
a tough one, Buell.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.615
Sorry about your nail polish.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.326
Oh God, don't…
don't worry about that.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.285
Ugh.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.039
Thank you for taking
such good care of me, Miss Anna.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.248
Of course.

11:06.332 --> 11:10.127
Buell, you have been working for us
for so long, it…

11:10.211 --> 11:11.671
You feel like family.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.131
Well, you're nothing
like my mother, Miss Anna.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.469
And I have some pretty hard stories
about my father too,

11:18.552 --> 11:20.054
but that's for another day.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.729
She sure was special.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.109
It's her birthday tomorrow.

11:34.735 --> 11:35.653
I remember.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.084
Happy birthday, baby girl.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.252
I made your favorite.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.301
"Happy birthday, angel. Love, Daddy."

12:03.431 --> 12:04.807
He found you your turtle.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.523
You know, last time I was here,
I was in kind of a bad place.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.525
I bet you were worried about me.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.527
I was worried too.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.780
But you know what, honey?
I think I'm gonna be okay.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.365
I really do.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.287
I feel like the storm clouds
have finally passed.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.414
Hi, Anna.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.915
Oh. Hey.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.210
What… what are you doing here?

12:33.878 --> 12:37.256
Uh, we just attended the burial for Lisa.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.383
Uh, Chastity.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.635
Jesus, I don't know.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.849
That's very kind of you, considering--

12:46.932 --> 12:48.392
What, that she was a criminal?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.771
Yeah. Well…

12:51.854 --> 12:52.897
…whatever she was,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.775
she didn't deserve what happened to her.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.861
How's Emma?

12:59.987 --> 13:02.406
Um, she's kind of the reason we're here.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.368
All Emma knows is
that someone else she cares about is dead.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.415
I figured this would bring her
some sort of closure. Something.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.502
What a mess.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.837
Is there anything I can do?

13:18.339 --> 13:19.298
Like what?

13:19.882 --> 13:23.344
Build a time machine so we
can go back in time and change things.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.475
I'm sorry about the restraining order.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.062
I would've done the same thing.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.691
It's her birthday today.

13:38.692 --> 13:43.405
Hmm. Well, happy birthday, Elizabeth.
You've got one hell of a mom.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.118
-Am I allowed to say hi to Anna?
-Yeah. Of course you are, honey.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.038
Hi, Anna.

13:51.872 --> 13:52.706
Hi, Emma.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.709
All right. We should go.
It's good seeing you.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.336
Wa… wait one second.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.217
I want you to have this.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.847
-Come on. That's for Elizabeth.
-I want her to have it.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.643
Life is for the living…

14:15.354 --> 14:16.814
and so are casseroles.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.943
Maybe you could come over tonight
and share it with us.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.363
I'd like that.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.240
Okay. Come on.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.501
Happy birthday, baby.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.805
Hi. Go ahead.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.098
It's over here, Detective Lane.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.183
I don't know
how we missed it the first time.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.853
But I think we have our murder weapon.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.439
Oh boy.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.654
Storm's coming in.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.950
It's okay.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.869
You're safe inside.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.520
So now any time you want a cup of coffee,
you come to my house?

16:19.603 --> 16:20.854
Can we come inside, Anna?

16:21.438 --> 16:22.356
Uh, sure.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.444
Oh, this is Officer Spitz.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.198
Do I have your permission to look around?

16:31.699 --> 16:32.574
Uh,

16:33.242 --> 16:34.451
of course.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.706
So, what's going on?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.000
Have a seat, Anna.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.961
Okay. You're scaring me.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.046
We released Rex Bakke.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.882
-What?
-He had an airtight alibi.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.845
CCTV shows him at Wild Bill's
the night of the murder.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.347
The only thing he slayed
was his dance routine.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.726
My God. Well, I don't understand.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.936
If… if he didn't do it--

17:01.020 --> 17:03.647
Detective Lane?
You're gonna wanna see this.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.198
What you got?

17:13.282 --> 17:14.783
Looks exactly the same.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.577
What looks exactly the same?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.621
Would someone please tell me
what's going on?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.457
We found the murder weapon, Anna.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.751
-Not too far from Chastity's body.
-Okay.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.545
It was a palette knife, just like these.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.755
What are you saying?

17:28.338 --> 17:29.715
You think I did it?

17:30.215 --> 17:33.719
What possible reason
would I have to kill Chastity?

17:33.802 --> 17:35.929
You tell me.
Maybe you wanted what she had.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.514
Oh, that's insane.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.893
The handsome fella,
the cute little girl, the perfect family.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.520
What?
What are you talking about?

17:43.604 --> 17:46.440
-There's no… no--
-Detective Lane.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.654
When did I paint that?

17:53.781 --> 17:56.575
I swear I… I don't remember painting that.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.036
I bet you don't remember
a lot of things you do.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.750
You're gonna wanna get yourself
a good attorney, Anna.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.169
I don't need a good attorney.
I didn't do anything.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.254
Then you wouldn't mind
coming down to the station

18:09.338 --> 18:11.507
and answering a few questions for us.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.371
I swear I didn't do it.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.131
You okay, Anna?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.501
