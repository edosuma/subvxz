WEBVTT

00:27.110 --> 00:29.237
Ooh, look. The new heads
are in early this year.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.091
Where is everyone? This place is quiet.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.218
- Too quiet.
- Quiet, Elfo!

00:52.302 --> 00:54.304
- So empty.
- Like Jerry's head.

01:01.936 --> 01:03.813
Yo! Over here, dumbass.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.484
Ah! Two steps to the left.
Three steps to the right.

01:08.526 --> 01:09.944
And cha-cha.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.242
I dreamt this was gonna happen.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.828
Everyone, shut up! I hear something.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.721
Fascist goons.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.264
That means Dagmar is back.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.849
Start pantin', pervo.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.935
Oh, I hope she's wearing her boots.

01:42.018 --> 01:42.852
Follow me.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.918
Flip, flip, trip, dip, dip, dip.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.306
If I were drunk,
this wouldn't seem so dangerous.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.781
Why does it smell like
wet boots and whiskey in here?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.117
And sadness. Don't forget the sadness.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.952
I just need to get something.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.791
Say hello to Blunty the Giant Slayer.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.377
- There are no giants around here.
- Exactly.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.671
Why is my bed so lumpy?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.715
Okay, Bunty. Get up.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.927
- Wow!
- Is that you, Frankie?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.053
Hi, Jerry.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.434
Do not look at me
while I'm changing.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.560
That includes you, Elfo.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.479
Okay, who are you? Why are you here?

03:08.563 --> 03:09.939
What were you doing in my bed?

03:10.023 --> 03:13.192
I want answers, and I want 'em now
to all but that last question.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.864
Let me speak to them
in their native language.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.074
- Ask 'em when my mom took over.
- Got it.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.711
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.088
- Well, what did they say?
- Utter gibberish.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.799
Okay, next up, Dagmar's neck.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.677
Mmm. Can we have a quick meeting
in the conference closet?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.095
Mmm.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.810
Okay, Bean. If we're going to
get Dagmar, we need a strategy.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.688
Here's what I've been thinking about.
You go low, I'll go thigh.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.440
I mean, I'll go for her booty.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.900
I mean boots. I mean…

03:53.983 --> 03:56.986
Elfo, I'm going to mercy kill
that thought right there.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.696
- Thank you.
- Here's what I think.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.242
Bean, when you say you wanna slice your
mother's head off with that big sword,

04:02.325 --> 04:05.745
all I see is a sweet, innocent little girl
who's just asking to be loved.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.665
You know down in your heart
that that love ain't a-comin'

04:08.748 --> 04:11.334
because your mother
doesn't look at you as a person,

04:11.417 --> 04:13.544
but as an extension of herself.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.713
She's incapable of loving anyone, Bean.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.048
She's a narcissist.

04:17.131 --> 04:20.677
But as long as you still need her love,
she's got power over you.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.804
So, if you want to truly break free,

04:22.887 --> 04:26.766
you gotta stop focusing
on revenge and anger and wrath.

04:26.849 --> 04:30.478
Instead, just focus all your energy on
what matters the most, Bean. And that--

04:30.561 --> 04:31.396
Murder!

04:38.569 --> 04:39.862
Oh, yeah!

04:51.791 --> 04:53.501
Who's slouching now, Mom?

04:53.584 --> 04:56.004
- Hello, Bean.
- Welcome home.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.215
Uncle Cloyd? Aunt Becky?

05:00.550 --> 05:03.052
Since when did you two
jerks take over Dreamland?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.722
The last time I saw you,
I dropped a bookcase on you.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.558
The <i>Encyclopedia Erotica</i>
fell right on my face.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.977
I nearly suffocated
under that two-page spread.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.645
But I'm not complaining.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.064
And, boy, we know you've been busy.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.108
Committing your father
to an insane asylum.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.943
- That's right.
- Romancing a mermaid.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.570
- Uh-huh.
- Becoming Queen of Dreamland.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.948
Yeah. Wait, mermaid? Mora? That was real?

05:24.032 --> 05:27.285
We've been binging
all your exploits on our oracle fire.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.663
We don't know how it works, but
apparently, it will green-light anything.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.334
Odval, go mix up
another pitcher of Marugaritas.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.918
Yes, Your Beckyness.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.005
Make that two pitchers, please.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.091
Elfo, we've been looking for
your little elf friends everywhere.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.551
Where are they all hiding?

05:43.634 --> 05:46.304
That's for me to know
and you to flog it out of me.

05:46.387 --> 05:50.600
I don't know what Dagmar's got you up to,
but Dreamlanders will never stand for it.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.144
They don't even like it
when I tell them what to do.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.313
Oh, sweetie, we're already
taking care of that.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.439
"Sweetie"?

05:56.522 --> 05:58.649
Maybe I'll do to you
what I did to that throne.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.443
Toss them in the dungeon.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.944
- Hey!

06:13.039 --> 06:14.165
Ouch!

06:17.335 --> 06:19.837
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:20.755 --> 06:22.048
Wait for my head.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.806
Oh, wow. Here's where all the chumps went.

06:29.889 --> 06:35.144
Well, la-di-da.
The big shots finally decided to roll in.

06:38.439 --> 06:42.443
When I was in the monastery,
I learned two important lessons.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.279
One, always be kind to others.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.323
Two, you don't need nothin'.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.867
Except for pillows. Come here, pillows.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.498
Well, good night.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.756
Vip, if you move again…

07:04.465 --> 07:07.260
Vap, stop squirmin'.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.097
Okay, well, nobody panic.
We're here to save you.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.060
Not the response you were looking for?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.520
Not really. I--

07:17.603 --> 07:20.356
Yeah, it kind of landed
with a thud, didn't it?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.941
I don't understand you people.

07:22.024 --> 07:25.194
Well, maybe if'n you
didn't call us, "You people."

07:25.278 --> 07:26.863
Don't be so ungrateful.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.573
Bean's your queen, you dumb hicks.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.199
Oh, that's better.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.494
And Cloyd and Becky promised
to make Dreamland dreamy again.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.705
Cloyd and Becky
freed us from working, too.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.666
Cloyd and Becky
make the goons do all our jobs now.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.627
Even the cushy ones like dung stacker.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.754
You can't stay here forever.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.091
Oh, you have no idea how lazy we are.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.052
Now what?

07:50.136 --> 07:52.013
Attention, Dreamlanders.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.390
Who's next up for the royal treatment?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.602
- Pick me!
- Pick me!

07:57.685 --> 07:59.020
Over here!

07:59.103 --> 08:01.063
Step forward, Tedrick, the shepherd.

08:01.689 --> 08:05.067
<i>Ah dinnae ken</i> what to say
except… later losers!

08:08.654 --> 08:09.697
Have fun!

08:17.163 --> 08:19.790
Ah, I'm home, baby.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.211
A whole lot wiser and a whole lot balder.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.255
Where the hell is everybody?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.674
Nobody here but us urine barrels.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.593
- Who said that?
- Who said <i>that?</i>

08:30.676 --> 08:32.553
You want to get your head chopped off?

08:32.637 --> 08:34.180
Oh, King Zøg!

08:34.263 --> 08:36.682
It's Turbish, stupid. I mean Mertz.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.726
I know who you are.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.062
You better hide.
The goons are everywhere.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.856
They'll take you to the dungeon
with the rest of Dreamland.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.526
- Even Bean's down there.
- Bean?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.403
Do you hear me?

08:49.487 --> 08:52.490
Because I know I can definitely hear you.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.159
Yes, I… Uh-oh.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.995
Ow, my head is bumping.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.081
Ow! It's still bumping.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.667
Aren't you listening? I said, "Ow!"

09:03.167 --> 09:05.294
There's got to be a less stupid way in.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.343
Ha! My old grave.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.762
Down the hatch, boys.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.893
Turn left at the third rat.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.980
You step into the bottomless pit,
you've gone too far.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.065
Here I am, queen of nothing.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.316
You're queen of the dungeon.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.318
You're not queen of my dungeon.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.946
And I'm the king
of the sewer hole. Ta-da!

09:32.029 --> 09:33.948
Toilet troll! Jab it.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.535
What, are you trying
to make a jerk out of me?

09:37.618 --> 09:38.953
What happened to all your hair?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.290
It's called the cue ball.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.708
Should have got the Porky.

09:43.791 --> 09:44.959
Now, come on, Dreamland.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.129
It's me, King Zøg.
And I'll get you all out of here.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.089
- Thanks, but no thanks.
- But thanks.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.799
But no thanks, but thanks.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.968
You're doomed!

09:56.095 --> 09:57.221
Dad, I missed you.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.224
- I'm so sorry I sent you away.
- It's okay, Beanie.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.892
I got all enlightened.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.312
And now I'm back, baby.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.897
Or should I say, "Your Majesty."

10:06.981 --> 10:09.191
And I'm going to get us our throne back.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.319
So, who took over anyway?

10:11.402 --> 10:15.489
Derek and Oona? Odval and Sorcerio?
Mop Girl and Bucket Boy?

10:15.573 --> 10:16.574
Who's Bucket Boy?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.909
- No, it was Cloyd and Becky.
- Cloyd and Becky…

10:18.993 --> 10:21.537
- Cloyd and Becky?
- Uh-oh.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.499
- Cloyd and Becky…
- I think your dad has in-law issues.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.293
Dad, Dad, what's happening?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.587
Is the self-actualization wearing off?

10:30.588 --> 10:31.964
Find your goddamn Zen!

10:32.048 --> 10:33.007
Hey!

10:33.549 --> 10:37.345
I'm okay. I'm okay.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.472
Peace be with you.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.223
Om…

10:43.851 --> 10:44.769
What was that?

10:44.852 --> 10:46.812
Uh, that was a scream,

10:46.896 --> 10:50.316
and not a scream
of ecstasy, I will tell you.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.404
What does a scream
of ecstasy sound like, Elfo?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.405
I don't know.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.534
No, that must be
the royal treatment. Come on.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.318
Welcome, Tedrick.
Are you ready for the royal treatment?

11:34.402 --> 11:37.279
A chair with a back.
I really must be a king.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.364
Strap him down.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.325
This <i>cannae</i> be right.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.123
Oh, stop. We haven't
even done anything to you yet.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.625
- And slice!
- Now you can scream.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.379
- Whoa.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.422
Next.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.339
Run!

12:00.886 --> 12:01.846
Are they gone?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.056
Oh. Tedrick's still alive.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.015
Damn it.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.561
Aye, and I'm feeling fitter than ever.
Like I've had me porridge.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.605
Aye. Aye. Aye!

12:20.448 --> 12:21.949
Why is he wiggling like that?

12:27.079 --> 12:28.289
It's the royal treatment.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.375
They're turning
ugly Dreamlanders into ugly goons.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.086
Won't be needing his change purse now.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.546
And… doink.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.430
Your Majesty.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.433
Your other Majesty and the others.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.770
What the hell, Sorcerio?
Why are you helping Cloyd and Becky?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.980
I'm naive and innocent, I swear.

12:53.063 --> 12:57.067
They just use my lab because they
believe me to be an all-powerful wizard.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.194
Since when?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.820
Since I told them that.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.907
Most of this stuff is rented
from the Halloween shop.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.118
Please don't tell them I'm a fraud.
I've got a good thing going.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.495
Whoa.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.790
Is this what it's like to have long arms?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.959
Hello over there!

13:15.628 --> 13:17.755
Oh, put those down, little man.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.466
One scratch
and within an hour, you goon up.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.636
Wait. Those severed arms look familiar.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.931
I bet they were chopped off
that old lady who scratched me in Maru.

13:27.014 --> 13:30.267
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
they're the devil's hands,

13:30.351 --> 13:31.852
not idle playthings.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.146
They will be
the ruination of this kingdom.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.482
Dreamlanders don't deserve
a fate like this,

13:36.565 --> 13:39.193
no matter how annoying
and stubborn and dirty they are.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.070
We've got to save my people.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.364
Why did I ever hire you?

13:43.447 --> 13:46.116
I was a magician at Bean's
eighth birthday party.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.452
The children threw me in the dungeon.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.170
Careful, Jerry.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.339
I could really use
some oven mitts right now.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.801
Wake up, you dumb countrified clodhoppers!

14:03.884 --> 14:05.344
Jerry's got something to show you.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.889
They're not stupid hicks, Luci.
They're sophisticated urban boneheads.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.892
Look at them flames.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.602
I like the squiggly ones.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.188
Show me big brother Cloyd
and big sister Becky.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.900
There's little people in there.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.861
Oh, oh, this is the good part.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.492
Time for the royal treatment,
Lady Lingonberry.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.495
Hurry up.
I want everything I so richly deserve.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.752
Stop in the name of the law!

14:38.836 --> 14:41.422
- Her again.
- Yeah, her again.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.550
And "her" know all about your secret plan.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.636
- The plan to find the magic and steal it?
- Cloyd!

14:47.720 --> 14:48.971
What? No.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.307
What? No, the royal treatment.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.642
I know you're turning
the Dreamlanders into goons.

14:57.187 --> 15:00.900
<i>No! Keep that wrinkled</i>
<i>old arm away from my wrinkled old arm.</i>

15:00.983 --> 15:02.276
I didn't see that comin'.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.986
Suspense. That's how they hook you.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.488
It makes me think.
And that makes me angry.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.200
And now that all Dreamland
knows what you did… Sword!

15:14.538 --> 15:16.915
Beware the wrath of Blunty!

15:16.999 --> 15:18.042
You rang, ma'am?

15:18.125 --> 15:19.668
I said "Blunty," not "Bunty."

15:23.964 --> 15:27.509
Ah! A good old-fashioned ladies arm fight.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.262
A good old-fashioned
ladies arm fight?

15:39.688 --> 15:41.732
- Ooh! Get off me!
- Sorry.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.908
I'm not afraid of your stupid flail.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.076
My what?

15:52.826 --> 15:54.244
Prepare to bleed, Becky.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.918
I'll be in the pantry
making scones, ma'am.

16:01.001 --> 16:06.006
Uh-oh. I don't usually go for girl fights,
but it beats watching two fat guys

16:06.090 --> 16:08.676
slapping each other with chopped-off arms.

16:47.923 --> 16:48.841
Dad!

16:48.924 --> 16:51.385
Why can't
family reunions be more friendly?

16:51.468 --> 16:52.594
I'll kill you.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.139
We know, you'll kill everyone.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.307
Now, tell us where the magic is.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.351
Hey, leave Bean alone.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.813
- Jerry? We thought you were dead.
- You couldn't even do that right.

17:02.896 --> 17:06.066
All my life you told me,
"Get in the Jerry box."

17:06.150 --> 17:07.609
"Jerry, no one loves you."

17:07.693 --> 17:09.153
"No one will ever love you."

17:09.236 --> 17:10.571
"You're worthless."

17:10.654 --> 17:12.322
I'm not just worthless.

17:12.865 --> 17:13.866
I'm Jerry.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.452
Oh, give it up.
We're the only ones who love you.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.120
That may be true,

17:18.203 --> 17:19.955
but my friends like me a lot.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.707
And that's good enough for Jerry.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.259
Dad, you're okay.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.386
I feel all tingly.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.724
- Oh. Dad.
- Forget about me, Beanie.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.768
I'm too far gone.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.812
Dad, I just got you back,
I can't lose you again.

17:43.896 --> 17:48.692
I've been a nut, a hothead,
a tyrant, a ventriloquist,

17:49.234 --> 17:50.611
and now a monster.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.530
But I'll always be your dad.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.200
Oh, Dad, you've always been a monster.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.994
But that never stopped me from loving you.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.997
At this point, I don't know
who's enabling who.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.046
Bean, you made the scratch disappear.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.589
Wow.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.759
Would you mind
taking a look at this rash on my ass?

18:13.842 --> 18:15.469
- Ah!
- And he's back, folks.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.104
Run faster, Cloyd!

18:25.187 --> 18:28.482
We'll be perfectly fine as long
as we stay out of rock-throwing range.

18:32.986 --> 18:33.862
Ow!

18:33.946 --> 18:36.115
I aimed for where he was going to be.
