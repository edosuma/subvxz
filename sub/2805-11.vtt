00:01.168 --> 00:02.961
PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar...

00:03.045 --> 00:05.172
-They want me in DC?
-BRUCE: <i>Job's yours.</i>

00:05.255 --> 00:07.466
I can't leave
until I know the whole truth,

00:07.549 --> 00:11.428
until I really know what happened
to David Siegel that day.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.680
I'd like to request a book for study.

00:13.764 --> 00:18.185
Mosconi claimed that the greatest wealth
in the world was within its pages.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.520
You're gonna steal it for me.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.355
But there's something
you should know about me.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.358
I'm not an FBI agent.
I'm a Criminal Informant.

00:24.942 --> 00:28.320
All the pages held hidden symbols,
culminating with a picture of an idol.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.030
This is the idol of Sita.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.949
The idol had eyes
made out of rare diamonds.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.368
The Hope Diamond.
We're looking for its twin.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.203
NEAL: If it's a forgery, it's a good one.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.249
PETER: The initials "C.H." Curtis Hagen.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.292
We're going after the Dutchman again.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.588
-Hagen.
-I found this in Hagen's wallet.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.341
Hagen was watching someone all day
and taking notes.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.551
Could be whoever shot him.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.761
That's the same block
where we found Siegel's body.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.722
Neal, who's listed in apartment three?

00:55.806 --> 00:57.683
Wait. Electronic trip wire.

00:59.309 --> 01:03.313
-Someone has been studying you.
-Not just me.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.357
PETER:
This is everyone who's in my division.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.651
Whoever murdered Siegel
also framed Hagen.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.361
Probably killed him as well.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.280
PETER: This is Rebecca's apartment.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.614
Who is she, Neal?

01:16.618 --> 01:19.496
Let me guess, she never invited you over.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.081
It's outside my radius.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.168
I bet that's why she chose it.
Who is this woman?

01:27.296 --> 01:28.630
I have no idea.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.799
We have to leave, right now.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.760
She doesn't know we were here,
and we need to keep it that way.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.554
I'm staying here.

01:35.637 --> 01:39.516
And then what, you'll confront her,
convince her to tell you everything?

01:39.683 --> 01:42.186
-You could bring her in, question her.
-On what grounds?

01:42.269 --> 01:44.396
I don't have a warrant or hard evidence.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.981
We don't know
what we're dealing with here.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.859
We leave, regroup,
and figure out what to do.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.155
Siegel died six blocks from here.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.990
Somehow, he must have been
onto Rebecca.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.827
-Talk, now.
-I told you Hagen was threatening her.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.163
At least I thought he was.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.623
Instead, he was working with her.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.833
Siegel must have found out
about it and followed her here.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.628
She sees Siegel,
realizes her cover's blown,

02:07.711 --> 02:09.338
shoots him on the way back to his car.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.007
She killed him.

02:12.674 --> 02:16.178
Neal, we will not let her
get away with this,

02:16.970 --> 02:19.306
but you need to tell me everything.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.266
I mean everything.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.984
Hagen was looking for a lost treasure
that Mosconi hid 100 years ago.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.445
The same Mosconi
from the Gershon exhibit?

02:33.529 --> 02:34.988
Where I met Rebecca.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.407
I approached her
for information on Mosconi...

02:37.908 --> 02:39.201
(SCOFFS)

02:39.368 --> 02:41.620
...exactly like Hagen wanted me to.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.747
They played me from the start.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.333
What's so valuable
that they went through all this?

02:46.625 --> 02:48.544
The lost twin to the Hope Diamond.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.679
The motion detector at the door
is an electronic trip wire.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.639
It's a custom job, from all appearances.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.933
The windows are wired, too.
It's professional work.

03:03.225 --> 03:06.061
We don't know much
about this woman, Rebecca Lowe,

03:06.144 --> 03:08.605
but as of now, she's the prime suspect

03:08.689 --> 03:11.984
in the murders of
Curtis Hagen and Agent David Siegel.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.322
-Neal, you want to give us a minute?
-I'm fine.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.908
Come on, Caffrey,
grab a cup of coffee with me.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.121
She was my girlfriend, all right?

03:25.122 --> 03:28.709
Peter, I appreciate you trying to
protect me, but I can handle this.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.045
I know what you're thinking,
and I want you to stay away from this.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.548
You said it yourself,
she can't know we were there.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.259
If I don't act like everything's normal,
she'll get suspicious.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.599
Okay, but we use it to our advantage.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.768
While you're keeping her occupied,
we'll search her home.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.983
She was so sweet and thoughtful,

03:53.734 --> 03:55.527
so normal.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.863
We were supposed to go
shopping next week.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.157
Well, it's safe to say that's canceled.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.576
I kind of feel duped,
and I barely know her.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.494
I can only imagine
what Neal must be feeling.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.081
I'm just worried whether
he can keep up appearances.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.959
Don't you feel bad for him?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.670
I do, but...

04:14.463 --> 04:17.674
He lied to her about who he was, too.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.720
You know, hon, you should be
a little more understanding.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.515
You know, what I understand
is that a life of lies

04:24.598 --> 04:28.185
catches up to you, and it did for Neal.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.483

04:36.151 --> 04:37.361

04:54.753 --> 04:57.214
"A woman's face is her work of fiction."

04:57.381 --> 05:00.050
Well, everything about her
was fiction, Moz.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.052
If it's any consolation,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.054
I didn't see it coming, and I vetted her.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.223
That worked out well.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.685
She had us all fooled,
and that's not easy to do.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.145

05:13.647 --> 05:16.358

while the FBI raids her apartment.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.250
If Rebecca killed Hagen,
there's a chance...

That she has the blackmail video, yeah.

So you told her you loved her?

14:29.953 --> 14:31.830
I had to buy you guys some time.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.334
The question is,
what angle is she playing?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.503
That's why she was packing.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.630
You think she's moving on
to her next target?

14:39.838 --> 14:42.216
I think you're the only target
she cares about.

14:42.508 --> 14:46.220
Yeah, she's packing up everything
from before she became Rebecca.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.347
Because she wants to stay as Rebecca.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.352
Neal, I think she meant what she said.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.146
She's in love with you.

15:18.627 --> 15:22.548
She profiled my exes to handcraft
a persona I would fall for.

Building the perfect girlfriend.

I think she built it a little too well.
Fell for her own con.

You really think she would have thrown
it all away and settled down with me?

15:33.642 --> 15:36.770
It explains why Hagen turned on her.
He lost control.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.439
And it also explains
why she turned on him.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.942
Maybe she got a read on me
and decided to play along.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.695
Okay, let's assume you're right.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.781
What reason would she have
for telling you she loves you?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.242
Keep me around, help with the diamond.

15:50.701 --> 15:53.620
It's a possibility, and in that case,

15:53.704 --> 15:55.581
she still has no idea we're onto her.

15:55.664 --> 15:59.710
Or I'm right, and she means it,
and we can use it against her.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.630
You know, your relationships

16:03.714 --> 16:06.925
aren't the only ones

she needs you.

with the Gershon Museum robbery.

Is there new information?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.714
This isn't about the museum.

17:12.658 --> 17:14.493
His name is Curtis Hagen.

Has Neal ever mentioned that name?

17:16.745 --> 17:19.206
I don't believe so. Why?

17:19.831 --> 17:21.792
He was murdered yesterday.

Neal Caffrey is our prime suspect.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.467
-NEAL: You see what she just did?
-JONES: Pretended not to know Hagen?

17:31.218 --> 17:34.471
Her fake concern to the news
that I'm a murder suspect.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.765
Nah, looked like real concern to me.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.268
It was real, but it wasn't for me.

17:40.185 --> 17:44.147
It's almost impossible not to react
to unpredictable news in some way.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.568
A good con knows how to turn
those tells into an advantage.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.570
-You play poker?
-Ah...

17:49.653 --> 17:51.822
I host the occasional Friday night game.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.658
You'll never be invited, no offense.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.453
In poker, it's too obvious
to act calm when you're nervous,

17:58.537 --> 18:00.205
but when you see that fourth ace drop...

18:00.372 --> 18:02.124
-The blood pressure spikes.
-Yeah.

18:02.207 --> 18:05.961
A good player knows you can't control
that, but you can hide its meaning.

18:06.378 --> 18:10.299
She's hiding her own concern of getting
caught by acting concerned about me.

18:10.549 --> 18:12.718
Or maybe you want her to be lying.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.764
I mean, it would be easier, wouldn't it?

18:21.894 --> 18:23.645
Neal isn't here today, is he?

18:23.729 --> 18:27.149
No, we assigned him
to another case across town

so that we have the opportunity
to interview his known acquaintances.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.906
I'm sorry, this is just a lot to process.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.034
I know Neal. He's not a murderer.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.495
No, no, he wouldn't get
his own hands dirty,

18:40.579 --> 18:42.164
but he's not above hiring others.

about Neal Caffrey.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.264
He says that a lot.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.685
Neal had a history with this man.

19:03.769 --> 19:06.647
He also had a strong motive
to want him dead.

I'm afraid I can't say.

She ruined my jacket.

25:14.264 --> 25:16.725
Yeah, and we're gonna make her pay
for that, but you're going home.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.101
I told you, I'm fine.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.687
-She shot you.
-She shot at me.

25:20.896 --> 25:24.066
She hit Hagen square in the heart.
She doesn't miss.

25:24.149 --> 25:25.943
If she wanted to kill me, I'd be dead.

25:26.235 --> 25:28.987
Fine. It was a warning shot,
and I'm taking the warning.

25:30.239 --> 25:32.115
Why take the shot in that moment?

25:32.199 --> 25:33.867
Maybe you looked especially smug.

25:33.951 --> 25:37.454
Or maybe we were close to something
she didn't want us to find.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.419
You had just finished searching this area.

25:45.712 --> 25:46.880
About to turn...

25:50.759 --> 25:53.679
The radiator isn't an ideal place
to hide something.

25:53.762 --> 25:57.224
Once the winter comes,
everything inside it would be destroyed.

25:57.307 --> 25:58.976
But she only paid for six months.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.562
She wasn't planning on seeing the winter.

26:10.571 --> 26:11.989
(CLANGING)

26:29.756 --> 26:31.341
There's a seam here.

26:37.347 --> 26:38.932
It's her go-bag.

26:43.854 --> 26:45.522
With this, she could go anywhere.

26:45.606 --> 26:47.482
Without it, she's stuck.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.943
We've got her trapped.

26:55.115 --> 26:58.785
Jones is running every alias we have
on her through the system.

26:58.869 --> 27:02.039
I'm hopeful something will ping,
give us some clues to who she is.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.540
You don't seem very optimistic.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.709
We still can't prove
she took a shot at you,

27:05.792 --> 27:07.878
and we didn't get a confession
at the park.

27:07.961 --> 27:11.215
The most we can get on her is stalking
and possession of fake IDs.

27:11.632 --> 27:14.593
We need more proof than
Siegel's Cooper three connection.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.345
That's true.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.640
He was standing outside her building.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.309
Then he walked to his car,

27:22.559 --> 27:24.478
where she got a jump on him.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.898
Yeah, she tossed Siegel's gun
and badge in the trash,

27:27.981 --> 27:29.942
but she wouldn't be
so careless with her own gun.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.610
What's the best way to get rid of it?

27:31.693 --> 27:33.278
Drop the gun in the river.

27:33.362 --> 27:35.239
But it'd take 30 minutes
to get there by foot.

27:35.322 --> 27:37.950
That's too far to carry a weapon
that could get her life behind bars.

27:38.033 --> 27:41.119
She wouldn't have hailed a cab,
too close to the scene.

27:41.203 --> 27:44.373
On the video, she was headed north.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.333
Towards her home.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.586
Did you find any equipment that
could have melted the gun down?

27:49.670 --> 27:51.505
Unless you count her hot plate, no.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.674
All right.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.885
So either she ditched the gun
in the sewer grate and kept moving...

27:56.969 --> 27:58.554
We checked all of them.

27:58.637 --> 28:01.932
Or she went home, waited for the heat
to die down, then disposed of it.

28:02.391 --> 28:04.059
It could be anywhere.

28:06.812 --> 28:08.146
What?

28:08.230 --> 28:10.190
It was raining the day Siegel died, right?

28:10.607 --> 28:11.650
Right.

28:14.862 --> 28:16.113
What?

28:16.321 --> 28:19.366
What if she hid it somewhere
where it would never be found?

28:23.662 --> 28:25.122
This is dappled.

28:25.497 --> 28:27.708
The day this was set, it was raining.

28:27.791 --> 28:29.751
She could've tossed the gun in here,
smoothed it over,

28:29.835 --> 28:31.503
and no one would ever know.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.839
Construction should have
been done months ago.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.340
I never would have thought of it.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.384
-Thank God for bureaucracy.
-Mmm.

28:39.178 --> 28:40.179
(JACKHAMMERING)

28:42.472 --> 28:45.475
X-rays showed something metal,
but with all that rebar in there,

28:45.559 --> 28:46.852
it's hard to tell what it is.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.187
Let's hope you're right.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.606
Otherwise, the city's gonna be
pretty pissed at you.

29:19.009 --> 29:21.053
The ballistics were a match,

29:21.470 --> 29:23.680
and we found a fingerprint
on one of the bullets inside.

29:24.932 --> 29:25.974
It matched Rebecca's.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.228
Now we just have to find her.

29:29.394 --> 29:33.398
Well, we're one step closer.
One of her passports pinged.

29:33.774 --> 29:36.652
-With who?
-MI5. I sent you the file.

29:38.028 --> 29:41.073
MI5 is serious business.
How'd she get on their radar?

29:41.156 --> 29:42.783
She was one of their agents.

29:44.243 --> 29:46.245
Her real name is Rachel Turner.

29:46.328 --> 29:48.956
Her father was American,
colonel in the US Army.

29:49.039 --> 29:50.332
Her mother was British.

29:50.958 --> 29:54.920
She moved around her whole life,
constantly uprooted, starting over,

29:55.003 --> 29:58.382
never learned to form attachments,
but got very good at faking them.

29:59.842 --> 30:03.220
She was a perfect shot,
great at developing underground contacts.

30:03.303 --> 30:06.807
Turns out she used those contacts
to sell confidential information.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.350
That's when she went underground.

30:08.433 --> 30:11.854
Every time they get close to her,
she reinvents herself and disappears.

30:12.437 --> 30:13.939
Not this time.

30:19.027 --> 30:20.571
You were right.

30:21.238 --> 30:24.116
I'm not sure about what,
but I like to hear that.

30:25.742 --> 30:28.620
-Rebecca fell in love with me.
-Yeah.

30:28.704 --> 30:30.372
It should be comforting.

30:30.539 --> 30:34.334
It means what we had
was somehow still real.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.378
But it's not.

30:36.545 --> 30:38.172
I wanted it to be.

30:40.174 --> 30:41.884
And she's a murderer.

30:43.844 --> 30:44.845
(SIGHS)

30:45.554 --> 30:47.389
You didn't know who she really was.

If I'm the only thing she's staying for,
let's use it.

30:55.439 --> 30:59.359
-No. I'm not using you as bait.
-You already did.

30:59.443 --> 31:00.527
When she didn't know the truth.

31:00.611 --> 31:03.614
Now she does, and need
I remind you, she shot at you.

31:03.697 --> 31:06.241
-I'm still here.
-Let's keep it that way.

31:07.242 --> 31:08.493
Go home, Neal.

31:08.911 --> 31:10.746
I'll call you if I hear anything.

(BEEPS)

31:40.192 --> 31:44.530
I know you have Hagen's blackmail on me,
and I have something you want,

31:45.197 --> 31:47.324
the location of the diamond.

31:47.950 --> 31:49.326
Let's talk.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.501
This is ridiculous.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.379
Indian food is traditionally
enjoyed on the floor.

32:00.629 --> 32:02.631
I'm not gonna hide in my own home.

32:03.090 --> 32:05.384
You have an ex with a sniper rifle, Neal.

32:05.634 --> 32:08.178
Bare minimum, we have
to stay low and avoid windows,

32:08.262 --> 32:11.765
which is no easy task
with this open-concept design.

32:13.016 --> 32:14.726
I offered her a trade.

32:14.810 --> 32:17.729
The location of the diamond
in exchange for Hagen's blackmail video.

32:17.813 --> 32:19.606
We don't have the location, Neal.

32:19.690 --> 32:22.651
What we have is a nearly
indecipherable equation

32:22.734 --> 32:24.695
locked up in the steel trap of my mind.

32:24.778 --> 32:26.613
But she doesn't know that.

-Hand me the gobi. I'm stress-eating.
-(SIGHS)

32:28.782 --> 32:30.659
It was the only way to draw her out.

32:31.285 --> 32:35.747
So best-case scenario,
you meet with her, she brings the video.

32:35.998 --> 32:39.543
The feds show up, arrest her,
and find the video.

32:40.335 --> 32:43.755
All the blackmail Hagen has on me
is exposed and I go back to jail.

32:43.839 --> 32:45.465
That's the best-case scenario.

32:45.674 --> 32:48.468
Worst-case, she discovers
I don't know the location,

32:48.552 --> 32:50.262
realizes I'm trying
to pull one over on her...

32:50.345 --> 32:53.348
And I find myself
reciting Proust over your grave.

32:54.099 --> 32:56.018
Looks like I need to find
a third scenario.

32:56.101 --> 32:57.227
Yeah.

32:57.311 --> 32:59.479
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

33:09.489 --> 33:11.783
Should I be brushing up on my Proust?

33:22.753 --> 33:24.296
No FBI outside?

33:24.379 --> 33:26.840
You know I don't want the bureau
to get ahold of that video.

33:26.924 --> 33:29.760
Regardless, as long as you're
on that anklet, I'd rather not linger.

33:29.927 --> 33:32.554
-Where's my diamond?
-Location's in here.

33:34.181 --> 33:35.307
Your turn.

33:38.393 --> 33:42.689
Giving up millions and millions of dollars
for this one little video.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.192
You must really want it.

33:46.777 --> 33:48.820
Looks like we both got what we wanted.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.575
Come with me.
Let's get the diamond together.

33:54.993 --> 33:55.994
Why would I do that?

33:56.078 --> 33:59.206
Because you want to be with me,
and you know I want the same thing.

33:59.998 --> 34:01.416
I know you want that diamond.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.461
It stopped being just about
the diamond a long time ago.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.339
We can have everything we want.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.550
There's nothing in our way anymore.

34:10.175 --> 34:12.970
Except that I can't possibly believe you.

34:15.931 --> 34:17.182
Take it.

34:18.684 --> 34:20.102
I don't care anymore.

34:22.729 --> 34:24.314
Just come with me.

34:40.497 --> 34:42.291
The FBI is on the way.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.421
You called the feds?

34:47.504 --> 34:49.256
You killed my new handler.

34:50.424 --> 34:52.301
Don't make me do this, Neal.

34:52.843 --> 34:53.927
Too late.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.263
It's over.

35:02.394 --> 35:05.397
You're an idiot.
We could have had everything.

35:05.814 --> 35:08.275
-It wouldn't have been real.
-You're a con man.

35:08.358 --> 35:12.070
You could have convinced yourself,
but instead, you choose to stay shackled.

35:12.154 --> 35:14.323
-And yet, still freer than you.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.700

because you can't face the truth.

35:18.869 --> 35:21.163
-What's that?
-That you hate who you really are.

35:21.788 --> 35:23.207
And I can see why.

You know me so well,

35:27.794 --> 35:30.088
you know I never turn up
without a way out.

Actually, there are three ways out,

through the south window
or one of two doors.

Look, somebody already beat me to it.

36:20.097 --> 36:22.933
Now you know why I didn't
mention the fourth way.

36:23.016 --> 36:26.061
Rachel Turner,
you are under arrest for murder.

36:33.235 --> 36:35.863
I gave you strict instructions
not to bait her.

36:36.238 --> 36:37.865
It worked, didn't it?

36:41.451 --> 36:44.288
How'd you know
she wasn't gonna shoot you?

Rachel Turner has been officially charged
with the murder of Agent David Siegel.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.025
I guess that's what they call closure.

Look at it this way,

37:15.694 --> 37:18.655
the next lucky woman who comes along
is gonna seem like a million bucks.

37:18.739 --> 37:22.034
Either that, or every relationship
after this is gonna seem really boring.

37:22.117 --> 37:24.077
Well, there's a lot of room
between really boring

37:24.161 --> 37:26.538
and someone taking a shot at you.

37:29.791 --> 37:33.295
It takes a damn good agent
to help solve his own murder.

37:37.299 --> 37:39.176
Something else I should tell you.

37:39.426 --> 37:41.720
I'm not sure I'm up
for another surprise right now.

37:41.803 --> 37:45.098
I don't think this will come
as a huge shock to you.

37:46.767 --> 37:48.060
You're going to Washington.

37:48.143 --> 37:50.604
They want me as a section chief in DC.

37:51.563 --> 37:53.524
Well, it's been a long time coming.

37:54.650 --> 37:56.193
-You deserve it.
-Oh.

37:57.569 --> 37:59.446
Uh, the job starts in two weeks.

37:59.530 --> 38:01.198
-Two weeks? Wow.
-Yeah.

38:01.823 --> 38:05.118
Hard to imagine not working here anymore.

38:05.202 --> 38:06.954
Yeah. Poor Jones. What's he gonna do?

38:07.037 --> 38:10.040
Well, I'm hopeful that he will
keep you out of trouble.

38:11.875 --> 38:15.379
In light of recent events,
I'm not sure that's the best idea.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.799
You helped bring in Siegel's killer.

38:19.508 --> 38:22.761
That's the only thing
you should feel responsible for.

38:24.471 --> 38:28.183
If anyone sees it differently,
they should come talk to me.

38:35.566 --> 38:38.485
She got what she deserved.
You, my friend, did not.

38:39.152 --> 38:40.571
Not yet.

38:41.238 --> 38:42.656
But the game's not over.

-You want to go after the diamond?
-Well, look on the bright side.

Now we don't have to split it three ways.

-There's no reason to wait.

Wow. It took me longer to get over
my favorite barista moving to Brooklyn.

38:59.173 --> 39:01.091
I'm guessing millions of dollars
in treasure

39:01.175 --> 39:02.718
would have helped speed up your recovery.

39:02.801 --> 39:03.844

39:27.492 --> 39:28.952
Well, I don't have any rosemary.

39:29.036 --> 39:31.163
Then total silence will do.

39:37.711 --> 39:40.464
I really appreciate
the opportunity, Bruce.

39:40.797 --> 39:43.884
Yeah, you bet.
I can't wait to get started.

39:44.968 --> 39:47.554
Bruce, I have to run. El just got home.

39:47.638 --> 39:49.056
I appreciate you keeping an eye on her.

39:49.515 --> 39:52.142
-Thanks, bye.
-Hi.

39:52.226 --> 39:54.478
-Hey.
-So good to be home.

39:55.312 --> 39:56.980
Good to have you home.

39:57.356 --> 39:58.732
BOTH: Mmm.

39:58.815 --> 39:59.942
Really good.

40:00.025 --> 40:02.194
-How's Neal doing?
-Pretty shook up.

40:02.486 --> 40:04.446
Did he learn something from it?

40:04.780 --> 40:08.825
Well, I'm afraid to say it, hon,
but maybe.

40:09.243 --> 40:12.246
-Well, for the better?
-We'll see.

40:13.956 --> 40:15.791
Are we celebrating?

40:16.208 --> 40:18.585
Siegel's case is closed.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.547
Rebecca is behind bars,

40:22.673 --> 40:24.800
and the Burkes are going to Washington.

40:24.883 --> 40:25.884
-(EXCLAIMS)
-(CORK POPS)

40:26.218 --> 40:29.137
-Is it official?
-It is. I just spoke to Bruce.

40:29.221 --> 40:30.556
Oh! Mmm.

40:30.639 --> 40:32.599
I'm so proud of you.

40:32.683 --> 40:37.187
Well, this is actually perfect timing,
'cause I have some news of my own.

40:37.271 --> 40:39.690
When we first started talking
about Washington,

40:39.773 --> 40:41.233
I reached out to the National Gallery.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.402
They just called me
and offered me a position.

40:43.485 --> 40:44.945
What? Fantastic.

40:45.028 --> 40:46.738
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

40:46.822 --> 40:48.073
Well, I didn't want to get my hopes up.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.575
You know, I thought it was a long shot.

40:50.534 --> 40:52.703
-To us.
-Yeah.

40:53.328 --> 40:54.872
And to our new life.

40:55.664 --> 40:59.251
-We're really doing this, aren't we?
-Yeah, I think we are.

41:00.711 --> 41:02.045
Wow.

41:02.254 --> 41:03.380
You okay?

41:03.589 --> 41:05.257
Yeah, it's just...

41:05.340 --> 41:07.593
It's finally hitting me, you know.

41:08.093 --> 41:11.847
We're gonna be packing up this whole
house and walking out that front door.

41:13.765 --> 41:15.058
Yeah.

41:15.642 --> 41:18.061
-It's gonna be tough to leave.
-Yeah.

41:18.687 --> 41:22.149
But then again, there will be
a new door we can go through

41:22.900 --> 41:24.860
at the National Gallery.

41:24.943 --> 41:26.361
And the FBI headquarters.

41:26.445 --> 41:28.113
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

41:30.574 --> 41:31.867
To new doors!

41:31.950 --> 41:32.951

42:01.522 --> 42:04.024
I'm impressed, Neal. That was well played.

42:04.316 --> 42:07.319
What's the threat?
You kept a backup of the video?

42:07.694 --> 42:09.238
No, I didn't.

42:10.906 --> 42:13.534
<i>There's no threat, just a promise.</i>

42:14.618 --> 42:16.286
I'll see you soon.
