McFist employees manufacturing

00:31.709 --> 00:35.583
some of your favorite
human fuels like McMeat Stache.

00:35.667 --> 00:39.083
-The moustache-flavored "meat snack."
-(students) Ooooh!

00:44.625 --> 00:47.875
Amazing! It tastes exactly like moustache.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.000
You don't know what moustache tastes like.

00:50.083 --> 00:53.250
Really? Have you kissed my nana
on the mouth? Because I have.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.500
-(groans)
-Ever stare up at the stars

00:55.583 --> 00:57.959
and wonder where sand comes from?

00:58.041 --> 01:01.375
-Find out at our next stop.
-Ooh! I'm a huge sand collector.

01:01.458 --> 01:04.834
Well, not huge sand. That'd just be rocks.

01:04.917 --> 01:06.250
(all groan)

01:06.333 --> 01:09.834
Ugh! I'm in my archenemy's lair.

01:09.917 --> 01:12.875
It's my chance to stop his next
evil scheme before it even starts.

01:12.959 --> 01:16.333
-And I'm stuck on this stupid tour.
-I'm enjoying this stupid tour.

01:16.417 --> 01:18.417
We're about to find out how sand is made.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.000
Face it. For once, there is no scheme.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.792
This is my favorite scheme ever!

01:23.875 --> 01:26.375
(groans) Hannibal,
I've worked day and night

01:26.458 --> 01:28.375
and broken every law of physics

01:28.375 --> 01:30.208
to build you a Time MacChine.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.875
You gonna tell me what you need it for?

01:31.959 --> 01:35.375
I am going back in time

01:35.458 --> 01:40.125
to buy every box of my favorite
discontinued breakfast cereal.

01:40.208 --> 01:42.166
Oh, heavens.

01:42.250 --> 01:46.041
I hated "Oh Heavens." I'm talking
"Atomic Cavity Sugar Blasters."

01:50.125 --> 01:52.625
(announcer) <i>Atomic Cavity Sugar Blasters.</i>

01:52.709 --> 01:55.625
<i>They're nuke-licious!</i>

01:55.709 --> 01:58.917
You think they'll be around forever,
then the next day, gone.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.750
(sighs) It really makes you think.

02:00.834 --> 02:04.250
This is a single use Time McChine.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.875
Are you sure you don't
wanna use it for something,

02:07.959 --> 02:11.041
I don't know, destroy-the-Ninja related?

02:11.125 --> 02:13.792
Hmm. Nope. I'm going with cereal.

02:13.875 --> 02:17.291
-Breakfast will never be the same.
-(beeps)

02:18.333 --> 02:21.834
That's how sand is made?
Did you have any idea?

02:21.917 --> 02:23.625
-None.
-(feedback whines)

02:23.709 --> 02:27.041
(McFist) <i>This scheme</i>
<i>is going to totally the game.</i>

02:27.125 --> 02:28.959
<i>It's going to be a real change gamer.</i>

02:29.041 --> 02:31.458
(Viceroy) <i>I think you mean game changer.</i>

02:31.542 --> 02:35.250
Game changer! I love it. Hey,
what is that, some sort of button?

02:35.333 --> 02:38.500
Did you hear that?
McFist has a game changer.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.375
Do you know what that means?
He's found a way to destroy...

02:41.458 --> 02:44.959
Found a way to change games
without getting up from your bean bag.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.875
Or your thing.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.041
I need to get off this tram
and find that game changer.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.792
I'm going with you,
you know, in case it's my thing.

02:51.875 --> 02:54.667
Principal Slimovitz,
Randy and Howard are talking

02:54.750 --> 02:56.667
about sneaking off the tour.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.083
What the cheese, Doug?

02:59.166 --> 03:01.542
Thank you, Douglas,
for bringing this to my attention.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.166
Now unfortunately for Douglas,

03:03.250 --> 03:05.750
the only thing I hate
more than tour deserters

03:05.834 --> 03:07.458
is a tattletale.

03:07.542 --> 03:11.375
Everyone look at Doug.
Nowhere else, just at Doug.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.083
Don't worry about what
Randy and Howard are doing.

03:14.166 --> 03:15.625
Look at Doug.

03:15.709 --> 03:18.750
Doug's the one in trouble. Only Doug.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.792
(wailing)

03:21.875 --> 03:23.959
Bonked my knee. Yeah, that hurts.

03:24.041 --> 03:27.083
-(wailing)
-Howard, shh!

03:27.166 --> 03:30.792
-But whining makes it feel better.
-Stop it.

03:30.875 --> 03:35.166
Just at Doug. Nowhere else.
Everyone look at Doug. Look at Doug.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.917
(McFist) You know what
my favorite flavor was, Viceroy?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.291
Blue.

03:39.375 --> 03:43.000
There you go, sir.
I was able to scare up just enough heart

03:43.083 --> 03:45.750
to get in to send you there and back.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.917
Let's do this. Outstanding!

03:48.000 --> 03:51.500
<i>Mr. McFist,</i>
<i>there's a sorcerer on the phone for you.</i>

03:51.583 --> 03:54.208
Isn't that always the way?
Every time you're about to cop a squat

03:54.375 --> 03:56.875
on the old time machine
an evil sorcerer calls?

03:56.959 --> 03:59.000
(groans)

03:59.083 --> 04:01.625
Hey, sorry about that.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.792
You did!

04:03.875 --> 04:06.458
Usually people kind of let that one go.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.875
We made a deal, McFist.

04:08.959 --> 04:13.291
My freedom in exchange
for the super power of your choosing.

04:13.375 --> 04:14.625
I love that deal.

04:14.709 --> 04:18.000
(Sorcerer) But you continue to fail me!

04:18.083 --> 04:22.208
Perhaps it is time to find
another worthy of my reward.

04:22.291 --> 04:26.625
Whoa, whoa! Let's not say
things we can't take back.

04:26.709 --> 04:28.041
I've got a plan.

04:28.125 --> 04:31.792
Yep, yes, indeed. This one's a real beaut.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.083
I'm gonna get you out
of that hole today. Guaranteed.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.083
Guaranteed?

04:35.166 --> 04:39.375
This is your last chance, McFist.

04:39.458 --> 04:43.000
You just promised the Sorcerer
you'd get him out today.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.417
-How are you gonna do that?
-You'll think of something.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.667
-Now get thinking of something.
-Humph!

04:49.667 --> 04:52.875
Viceroy's lab.
The game changer's gotta be in here.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.125
Man, I hope so.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.709
Do you know how much time I would save

04:55.792 --> 04:57.709
if I didn't have to get up
to change my own games?

04:57.792 --> 05:00.583
Seconds, Cunningham, seconds.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.542
(McFist) I don't know why I answered that.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.375
(both grunt)

05:04.458 --> 05:06.625
Quick. In the porta potty.

05:06.709 --> 05:10.667
It's the same every time.
"Why haven't you destroyed the Ninja?

05:10.750 --> 05:13.000
I've been trapped in a hole
for 800 years. Boo-hoo!"

05:13.083 --> 05:13.917
What are you doing?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.333
Trying to program
this stupid techno toilet.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.625
Let's see. I'll lead off with a one.

05:19.709 --> 05:21.417
(gasps)

05:21.500 --> 05:23.333
-(stomach rumbles)
-Better make it a two.

05:23.417 --> 05:25.208
You're not doing that while I'm in here.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.500
Sorry. Can't wait. (farts)

05:28.583 --> 05:29.750
Oh!

05:31.333 --> 05:34.000
False alarm. Just a one after all.

05:34.083 --> 05:37.125
-You're the worst kind of friend.
-(farts)

05:37.208 --> 05:38.583
No, it's a three.

05:39.792 --> 05:42.000
-What's a three?
-It's one plus two.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.208
Man, you are terrible at math.

05:44.291 --> 05:47.583
Oh, boy!

05:47.667 --> 05:50.000
Viceroy, what do you think?

05:50.083 --> 05:52.667
Don't I look groovy? Gotta blend in.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.333
I don't wanna blow
my cover as a time traveler.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.625
Where'd the Time MacChine go?

05:58.709 --> 06:00.625
Not "where?" When?

06:00.709 --> 06:03.500
Fine. When did the Time MacChine go?

06:03.583 --> 06:05.417
Just now. Didn't you see it?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.083
(groans)

06:08.875 --> 06:12.208
I can't believe you just did that.

06:12.291 --> 06:15.709
Why are you getting all weird?
It's natural.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.500
-What happened to Viceroy's lab?
-(both gasp)

06:18.583 --> 06:20.083
What happened to Norrisville?

06:24.458 --> 06:26.250
What the juice?

06:26.333 --> 06:28.250
Cunningham, what is this place?

06:31.583 --> 06:34.333
Welcome to Ye Olde Amusement Pit.

06:34.417 --> 06:37.125
Skibow, forsooth, skibow.

06:47.792 --> 06:52.375
(gasps) Howard, we're in Norrisville.
We went back in time.

06:52.458 --> 06:56.625
You mean that porta potty
was also a time machine?

06:56.709 --> 06:59.166
No, I think it was only a time machine.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.083
That explains why it wouldn't flush.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.250
-(loud rumbling)
-(gasps)

07:03.333 --> 07:04.750
-(man) It's a stampede!
-(screaming)

07:04.834 --> 07:06.709
Grab your kinfolk. Run!

07:06.792 --> 07:08.709
Come on, now get!

07:15.291 --> 07:19.500
Howard, you better hide. OK, no,
you're good? You're already hiding?

07:19.583 --> 07:22.875
Looks like I got here just in Ninja time.

07:24.792 --> 07:28.667
I don't know what the cheese is going on,
but it ends now.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.166
Ninja flip!

07:36.667 --> 07:38.667
Stank. But that would mean...

07:39.959 --> 07:43.375
-(cackling)
-(Randy) The Sorcerer!

07:46.875 --> 07:50.583
Aww, I just got that wagon respoked.

07:53.709 --> 07:55.625
OK, all right, OK. Yeah, no, no, no.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.417
Looks like I'm fighting the Sorcerer
today. That's not a big deal.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.709
Holy cheese,
I'm fighting the Sorcerer today!

08:02.458 --> 08:05.000
Ninja battle rap flip!
Ninja battle rap flip!

08:05.083 --> 08:07.250
Ninja battle rap flip!

08:07.333 --> 08:10.250
Ninja, this will not be your day.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.375
(screaming)

08:24.667 --> 08:28.166
(screams)

08:30.166 --> 08:32.125
(grunts, gasps)

08:36.041 --> 08:37.125
(grunting)

08:37.208 --> 08:40.375
My clan has chased you
across many lands.

08:40.458 --> 08:44.125
Finally, the terror
you began begins to end now.

08:44.208 --> 08:47.041
No, wait. Wait.
What does that mean exactly?

08:47.125 --> 08:51.208
Fingers. Standing on my fingers.
(screaming)

08:53.041 --> 08:55.333
You're not the Sorcerer.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.333
No cheese, man. I'm the Ninja.

08:57.417 --> 09:00.917
Impossible! There is but one Ninja,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.333
and I am he.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.208
Wait a minute. Back in time,
sorcerers, bottomless pit,

09:05.291 --> 09:08.291
crazy Nomicon jabber. W.T. juice?
You're the first Ninja!

09:09.000 --> 09:10.458
You dropped me.

09:10.542 --> 09:13.375
I was going to trap
the Sorcerer in this hole forever.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.291
The plan you have undone
can now never be done.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.583
You've doomed us all! Jerk!

09:18.667 --> 09:21.583
Doomed us all?
I think you're exaggerating a little.

09:21.667 --> 09:24.166
I mean, it's not like I just
wonked up the future, right?

09:26.917 --> 09:30.583
(grunts) Oh, boy.

09:32.417 --> 09:35.667
(Sorcerer) McFist has failed me

09:35.750 --> 09:37.709
for the last time.

09:37.792 --> 09:41.750
I must find a way
out of this miserable hole!

09:45.000 --> 09:48.166
(chattering)

09:48.250 --> 09:51.333
What the juice? I'm free.

09:51.417 --> 09:54.834
(cackling) I'm free!

09:54.917 --> 09:57.000
(screaming)

09:59.750 --> 10:01.750
(Randy) Come on,
First Ninja. It's not that bad.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.333
We'll fix this together.

10:03.417 --> 10:06.041
My brothers made
the ultimate sacrifice in the battle

10:06.125 --> 10:07.125
to defeat the Sorcerer.

10:07.208 --> 10:10.291
And in one moment,
you have wrought our destruction.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I was fighting
the Sorcerer until you kicked me.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.625
If anyone hath wrought
anyone's destruction,

10:15.709 --> 10:18.750
you hath wrought it. Huh?

10:18.834 --> 10:23.000
Ninja, thank cheese I found you.
That barrel filled with pickles.

10:23.083 --> 10:27.166
Well, not anymore.
I'm filled with pickles. (burps)

10:27.959 --> 10:30.083
-Who's the fanboy?
-That's the First Ninja.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.959
-I call him First Ninja. Ow!
-Hey!

10:32.041 --> 10:34.750
Stop talking! I must visualize our dilemma

10:34.834 --> 10:36.834
if I am to actualize the solution.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.417
-This guy talks like the Nomicon <i>.</i>
-I know, right?

10:39.500 --> 10:43.291
-Ninja!
-What is it, my trusty squire Plop Plop?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.625
(both laughing)

10:46.583 --> 10:48.792
Why are they laughing?

10:48.875 --> 10:53.458
Your name. Plop Plop. It's fantastic.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.458
-What do they call you?
-Howard.

10:55.542 --> 10:57.125
Howard? That's a girl's name.

10:57.208 --> 11:01.125
-(laughing)
-(Plop Plop) That's a girl's name.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.542
Enough! My trap has failed.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.291
Plop Plop,
did you retrieve the Tengu Stone?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.875
About the stone, the Sorcerer got it.

11:09.959 --> 11:12.542
-Whoa.
-(screaming)

11:12.625 --> 11:15.333
You have failed, Ninja.

11:15.417 --> 11:18.542
The stone is finally mine.

11:18.625 --> 11:22.875
I will harness its power
and enslave you all.

11:22.959 --> 11:26.000
(laughing)

11:26.083 --> 11:29.458
-So that seems bad.
-Ohhh!

11:31.583 --> 11:32.792
(panting)

11:32.875 --> 11:35.583
OK, one, you gotta teach me
how to do that.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.083
And two, we could fix this.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.709
He's right. This is what he does.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.709
He messes things up
and then he fixes them.

11:40.792 --> 11:44.250
-What do you do?
-I point out the fact that he messed up

11:44.333 --> 11:45.667
and tell him he has to fix it.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.583
-What?
-Stop it!

11:47.667 --> 11:51.166
Sh! Settle. I get myself
into these little dillies A.T.T.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.917
<i>♪ All the time ♪</i>

11:53.000 --> 11:54.750
We'll just ask the NinjaNomicon <i>.</i>

11:54.834 --> 11:57.959
-What is that?
-Oh! You are in for a treat.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.625
You're gonna love theNomicon <i>.</i>
You talk just like it.

12:00.709 --> 12:03.291
Come, my friend, shoob with me.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.959
-So.
-Yeah.

12:10.208 --> 12:14.250
The NinjaNomiconis the combined
wisdom of every ninja ever.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.166
It knows, like, everything.

12:21.417 --> 12:24.500
So, Nomicool <i>,</i>
we got a sorcerer on the loose.

12:24.583 --> 12:28.125
He's armed with a super
powerful secret stone. What do you got?

12:28.792 --> 12:30.291
Here we go. Here we go.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.917
"You cannot right the future
until you write the past."

12:35.000 --> 12:38.083
-Uh-huh.
-You don't know what that means, do you?

12:38.166 --> 12:39.250
I do not.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.709
(cackling)

12:45.542 --> 12:48.000
-Oh, boy.
-(both gasp)

12:48.083 --> 12:49.834
(Randy) Whoa!

12:49.917 --> 12:53.583
My first name is Plop.
My last name was already Plop.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.875
No, no, no! The Nomicon is disappearing.

12:59.959 --> 13:03.417
I think by wonking up the past,
we shoobed the future.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.166
Most fun I've had in 800 years.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.959
(laughing) Hmm.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.875
-(door opens)
-How can I be of service,

13:15.959 --> 13:17.375
O Spooky One?

13:18.333 --> 13:22.125
I need a lift. (cackling)

13:22.208 --> 13:25.166
(laughs)

13:25.250 --> 13:26.166
Oh.

13:30.542 --> 13:34.333
(screaming)

13:34.417 --> 13:36.709
(cackling)

13:45.041 --> 13:47.750
And the next stop on our tour of...

13:52.667 --> 13:54.250
Onward!

13:54.333 --> 13:57.500
Principal Slimovitz,
some guy just destroyed our tour guide.

13:57.583 --> 13:58.542
Really, Doug?

13:58.625 --> 14:02.083
Tattling on an evil wizard,
did we not just discuss this?

14:02.166 --> 14:04.875
-(muttering)
-Work faster!

14:04.959 --> 14:07.250
I guaranteed the Sorcerer
he'd be free today.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.667
It's not my fault you made
a promise you can't keep.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.208
-You can't keep.
-(intercom buzzes)

14:11.291 --> 14:14.500
<i>Mr. McFist,</i>
<i>there's a Mr. Sorcerer here to see you.</i>

14:14.583 --> 14:15.625
Sorcerer?

14:20.041 --> 14:23.625
Hey, you're... Hey!

14:23.709 --> 14:28.375
I didn't believe
your ridiculous guarantee.

14:28.458 --> 14:29.834
But you did it,

14:29.917 --> 14:31.333
and I'm free.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.625
Yep, I did it. All me.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.959
-You did it?
-Didn't I? Didn't I, Viceroy?

14:37.041 --> 14:39.125
Bring him to me!

14:39.208 --> 14:41.375
-Bring who to you?
-The Ninja!

14:41.458 --> 14:43.583
I want him to look me in the eye

14:43.667 --> 14:46.750
and know all is lost.

14:46.834 --> 14:49.959
-Oh, you did it all right.
-Oooh!

14:50.041 --> 14:52.417
(chattering)

14:53.834 --> 14:56.250
I have lost. I am defeated.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.166
OK, I admit this looks bad,

14:58.250 --> 15:00.542
but we can't give up.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.875
-I'm down for giving up.
-Me too. Let's all give up.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.917
-Come on, you stopped this guy once.
-No, I didn't.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.792
Where I come from, you did.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.917
Where you come from no longer exists.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.625
I have battled
the Sorcerer my entire life.

15:12.709 --> 15:15.250
Now with the Tengu Stone,
he is unstoppable.

15:15.333 --> 15:18.792
When you have given all you have,
you have nothing left to give.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.458
I quit.

15:20.542 --> 15:21.917
We're Ninjas. We never quit.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.458
I can't believe he just quit.

15:24.542 --> 15:26.625
He's first Ninja. He's a legend.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.583
Fine, if he won't help...

15:28.667 --> 15:30.667
Don't. I know what you're gonna say.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.166
You're gonna be all,
"Howard, looks like it's up to us."

15:33.250 --> 15:34.417
I'm not gonna say that.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.208
-You're not?
-No.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.625
-'Cause you just did.
-I didn't mean to.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.834
(screaming)

15:46.792 --> 15:49.917
We'll need food if we're going
to start an underground resistance.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.250
Grab all the chicken you can
and sides. Don't forget the sides.

15:54.333 --> 15:57.083
He just wants to see the Ninja.
So we'll show him the Ninja.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.959
And action!

15:59.041 --> 16:01.542
What the juice?
It's Ninja time. Smoke bomb.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.083
-Perfect!
-This is never gonna work.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.750
(cackling)

16:08.625 --> 16:10.375
Yoo-hoo, Sorcerer.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.333
Ninja air fist.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.000
(whistling)

16:27.250 --> 16:28.917
Ninja kick!

16:32.166 --> 16:34.667
Ninja slice. Ninja slice. Ninja slice.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.583
So, Ninja,

16:39.667 --> 16:43.542
you must be desperate
to start a fight you cannot win.

16:43.625 --> 16:45.917
I don't need to win.
I was just distracting you long enough

16:46.000 --> 16:48.166
to snatch the stone. Now it's gone.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.583
-You'll never see it again.
-(whistles)

16:52.959 --> 16:54.792
-Got the stone.
-Oh, boy.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.959
Prepare to be destroyed.

16:58.041 --> 16:59.583
So do you get destroyed first?

16:59.667 --> 17:01.542
Or me? How we gonna do this?

17:01.625 --> 17:04.166
Hey, Howard, buddy, remember that time

17:04.250 --> 17:05.875
when we accidentally released the Tengu,

17:05.959 --> 17:08.542
and it flew up your butt
and turned you into a bird demon?

17:08.625 --> 17:12.166
Oh, yeah.
I never ever wanna do that again.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.792
You never will.
You never will after right now.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.333
Ninja sacred stone stab!

17:17.875 --> 17:21.375
(screaming)

17:26.083 --> 17:28.834
You cannot defeat me, Ninja.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.917
I can't, but we can.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.625
The Tengu
and the Ninja suit are forever linked.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.250
Ninja remote control Tengu punch!

17:38.750 --> 17:41.166
Four can play at this game.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.792
Relax, Howard. This is just you and me

17:47.875 --> 17:51.417
-playing Grave Puncher back home.
-(roars)

17:51.500 --> 17:53.917
Ow! I was not ready.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.792
Now I'm ready. Ninja punch.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.917
That was my guts. He got me in my guts.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.750
What?

18:09.834 --> 18:11.792
"To write the future,

18:11.875 --> 18:14.333
you must write the past."

18:14.417 --> 18:18.542
-Are you talking to me, or...?
-Shut up, Plop Plop.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.041
Battle rap!

18:35.125 --> 18:38.041
-(cackling)
-(Randy screaming)

18:40.375 --> 18:41.542
Howard.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.792
(laughs) Oh!

18:53.709 --> 18:57.208
Hey, First Ninja! You're back. Yes!

18:57.291 --> 18:58.333
Ninja never say quit.

19:05.917 --> 19:08.083
No! (screaming)

19:10.917 --> 19:13.083
(grunts, gasps)

19:13.166 --> 19:16.166
Ninja!

19:18.542 --> 19:21.542
Oh! I can't hold this forever, guys.

19:21.625 --> 19:25.583
Only when the stone is made
whole will the hole be made stone.

19:25.667 --> 19:28.291
Sweet cheese!
What the juice are you talking about?

19:28.375 --> 19:31.625
We've got to return
the bird demon to the stone.

19:31.709 --> 19:35.667
-Way ahead of you, First Ninj.
-What?

19:35.750 --> 19:38.625
-What are you doing?
-Relax. This worked last time.

19:38.709 --> 19:40.375
Pretty sure it's gonna work now.

19:43.542 --> 19:46.542
(wincing)

19:46.625 --> 19:50.083
Ow! That hurt the bottom of my feet!

19:55.959 --> 19:58.500
(cackling)

19:58.583 --> 20:01.417
McFist guarantees he's gonna get me out

20:01.500 --> 20:03.083
-of here today.
-(squeaks)

20:03.166 --> 20:06.917
Yeah, I don't believe him, either. (sighs)

20:07.000 --> 20:09.208
-(Howard panting)
-(Randy) You did good, buddy.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.792
-You did real good.
-Seriously!

20:11.875 --> 20:14.583
I never wanna do that again.
Promise me, Cunningham.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.333
I can't do that.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.041
The Sorcerer broke my spirit,

20:18.125 --> 20:20.458
but you showed me
what it means to be a true hero.

20:20.542 --> 20:22.709
-It was very...
-Bruce?

20:22.792 --> 20:24.542
Bruce. I like that.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.834
Look, I'm gonna need you to write down
everything you know.

20:27.917 --> 20:30.625
Believe it or not,
things don't always go as smoothly

20:30.709 --> 20:33.625
-as they did today.
-You got it, Ninja.

20:33.709 --> 20:39.917
(clicking tongues)

20:40.000 --> 20:43.500
You fought bravely today. I will name
all of my daughters in your honor.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.875
(snickering) Howard.

20:45.959 --> 20:47.625
And every time I go to the bathroom,

20:47.709 --> 20:49.959
I will remember you, Plop Plop.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.041
Speaking of,
let's get back to the portal potty.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.250
I gotta take a 21st century,
if you know what I mean.

20:54.333 --> 20:55.667
Oh.

20:58.250 --> 21:01.291
Ooh, there it is, right where we left it.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.291
-Always the last place you look.
-(insect buzzing)

21:03.375 --> 21:05.709
Whoa! I'm not going in there.

21:07.625 --> 21:10.917
-So that was...
-Yeah.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.333
Think everything's back to normal?

21:12.417 --> 21:14.417
Only one way to find out.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.583
Principal Slimovitz, Randy's sleeping.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.083
Really, Doug, really?

21:23.375 --> 21:24.375
(gasps)

21:29.417 --> 21:32.583
Now it is your turn to write history.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.792
So Bruce!

21:36.125 --> 21:38.750
(theme music plays)

21:56.041 --> 21:57.458
Chirp.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.041
(First Ninja) <i>Shut up, Plop Plop.</i>

22:03.291 --> 22:05.041
Well...

22:06.834 --> 22:09.083
What we got here?

22:09.166 --> 22:11.166
(Sorcerer cackling)
