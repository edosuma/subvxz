WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:02.672
Sarah?It's more dangerous out there
than we imagined.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.631
Sarah, you don't understand. If
you go out there, you will die.

00:04.761 --> 00:06.850
These people are tired.
Hungry.

00:06.981 --> 00:08.983
We're getting desperate.

00:09.114 --> 00:10.550
I'm going to give them
what they want --

00:10.680 --> 00:12.030
a safe place to live.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.032
And that's how we get our army,
that's how we...

00:14.162 --> 00:16.121
take the Tower from Strand.

00:16.251 --> 00:17.905
Aah!

00:18.036 --> 00:20.255
Arno, look!

00:20.386 --> 00:23.476
How many do you think
there are?Too many.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.827
If one of them gets out,
none of us are going anywhere.

00:26.957 --> 00:28.655
We're gonna take the Tower
for ourselves.

01:20.402 --> 01:23.231
Hey. They're gonna
leave without us.

01:48.517 --> 01:50.128
Daniel...

02:19.200 --> 02:20.549
Two-days hoofing it
there and back.

02:20.549 --> 02:21.942
We keep it lean and mean,

02:21.942 --> 02:23.683
we might just be able
to make it in one.

02:25.641 --> 02:27.904
What exactly are we up
against out there?

02:27.904 --> 02:30.211
D said a hundred dead outside.
Maybe more.

02:30.211 --> 02:32.735
No telling inside.
-My kind of party.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.041
That makes two of us.

02:36.217 --> 02:37.479
How's he doing?

02:37.479 --> 02:39.220
Making progress.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.962
It's slow, but steady.
Where are we going?

02:41.962 --> 02:44.530
To help D recover that stash
of weapons he found.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.489
I think it's probably best
if you stay here.

02:47.489 --> 02:49.491
Over a hundred skinbags?
Might need the help, Momo.

02:49.491 --> 02:51.363
Yeah, but we could use
the help here, too.

02:54.801 --> 02:56.019
Could you keep working
with Daniel,

02:56.019 --> 02:57.195
see if you can push him
some more?

02:57.195 --> 02:58.631
But this is important.

02:58.631 --> 03:00.154
We need the weapons
to get in the Tower.

03:00.154 --> 03:01.895
And we're gonna need Daniel
to get in there, too.

03:01.895 --> 03:04.289
He knows how Victor thinks
better than any of us.

03:04.289 --> 03:06.291
Is that why you think
we're doing this?

03:06.291 --> 03:07.422
So he can
help us fight?

03:07.422 --> 03:09.163
No. No, no.

03:09.163 --> 03:10.686
It's just that he's gone up
against Victor

03:10.686 --> 03:12.514
in ways that
none of us have,

03:12.514 --> 03:14.299
and this is about
all of us making it,

03:14.299 --> 03:17.824
so we got to do whatever we can
to make sure that that happens.

03:17.824 --> 03:19.173
We got to use
everything we got.

03:19.173 --> 03:21.741
Luci.
It's Daniel.

03:21.741 --> 03:23.482
I was grabbing some supplies
from the pantry,

03:23.482 --> 03:25.397
and when I got back from
the Mess Hall, he wasn't there.

03:25.397 --> 03:27.442
He must've wandered
to the Sonar Room again.

03:27.442 --> 03:30.010
I welded the door shut after
the last radiation leak.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.230
He's not on the sub.

03:32.230 --> 03:34.406
Front hatch was open,
a suit was gone.

03:34.406 --> 03:36.146
You go get the weapons.
I'll find him.

03:36.146 --> 03:38.236
No, we'll all go.If we don't leave now,

03:38.236 --> 03:40.194
we won't make it to
Dwight before dark.

03:40.194 --> 03:41.674
Morgan, I've got this.

03:41.674 --> 03:44.111
Oh, no. You're not doing this
on your own.

03:44.111 --> 03:45.591
Look, you both go.

03:45.591 --> 03:47.810
If there's any trouble,
you send up a mayday.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.878
Daniel, is that you?

05:38.878 --> 05:41.010
Take your masks off.

05:41.010 --> 05:42.185
Daniel.

05:42.185 --> 05:43.404
What the hell?

05:45.798 --> 05:48.496
I know who you are.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.196
Oh, my God.

05:53.196 --> 05:55.547
Hey, man,
it's clean anyway.

05:55.547 --> 05:57.984
Daniel,

06:44.509 --> 06:46.032
No.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.346
What's going on here?

06:56.346 --> 06:57.870
You're confused,
Daniel.

07:15.844 --> 07:18.238
Alright, come on.
Let's just get you ba--Hey, don't touch me.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.627
W-What did he say?

08:03.979 --> 08:05.894
Let's go back
to the sub.

08:05.894 --> 08:07.156
Come on.

08:07.156 --> 08:09.028
Wait. Eaters.

08:09.028 --> 08:12.335
The gunshot must have
drawn them.

08:12.335 --> 08:13.467
Come on.
Let's go.

08:15.991 --> 08:18.559
Hey, Luce,
it's not the dead.

08:21.170 --> 08:22.911
-Run.
-No.

08:22.911 --> 08:24.478
Boo.

08:30.963 --> 08:33.226
Time to take
a little trip.

09:04.562 --> 09:06.825
Where are we?Keep quiet.

09:06.825 --> 09:08.566
We wouldn't be here
if you had let me

09:08.566 --> 09:10.132
keep on looking
for Ofelia.

09:10.132 --> 09:11.569
If we're playing
"wouldn't be here,"

09:11.569 --> 09:13.396
I think we have you beat
with we wouldn't be here

09:13.396 --> 09:14.833
if you'd have stayed
in the damn sub.

09:18.576 --> 09:21.100
He's not saying
what I think he's saying?

09:26.671 --> 09:29.587
I'm not scared of these people.

09:29.587 --> 09:32.067
What's scary is what
I'm gonna have to do to them.

09:36.681 --> 09:38.291
We're screwed.

09:41.903 --> 09:43.557
Remove your gear
and hang it up.

09:43.557 --> 09:45.428
How do we know
it's safe?

09:45.428 --> 09:46.473
Test for yourself.

09:49.694 --> 09:51.565
It's safe.

09:51.565 --> 09:53.523
And we're lucky the wind hasn't
brought anything nasty this way,

09:53.523 --> 09:55.743
and we'd like
to keep it as such.

09:55.743 --> 09:57.615
Remove your gear
and hang it up.

10:06.841 --> 10:09.365
Do you recognize
these people?

10:09.365 --> 10:10.889
From The Holding?

10:13.369 --> 10:15.502
They're the ones
who were following Teddy.

10:15.502 --> 10:18.897
That's not gonna help us
make friends.

10:23.989 --> 10:25.338
Home sweet home.

10:34.826 --> 10:36.349
Inside, everyone.

10:36.349 --> 10:38.220
Our guests aren't
as interesting as they look.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.831
You all live here?

10:39.831 --> 10:41.528
Thanks to Alicia.

10:41.528 --> 10:43.704
That's two homes we've had
to abandon because of her.

10:43.704 --> 10:45.793
We were there
the first time.

10:45.793 --> 10:47.795
Wes.You don't have to
remind me who you are.

10:50.929 --> 10:53.714
Why don't you use the walls
to keep the dead out?

10:53.714 --> 10:55.585
We tried.
They didn't hold.

10:55.585 --> 10:58.284
At least this keeps
the living away.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.373
Victor Strand got one thing
right at that Tower.

11:10.078 --> 11:12.167
I'll talk to them
one at a time.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.778
What do you
want from us?

11:13.778 --> 11:16.258
I find these conversations
go better one-on-one.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.396
Why don't you
let us go?

11:23.396 --> 11:26.094
Maybe we can help you
with whatever you need.

11:26.094 --> 11:27.661
Not likely.

11:29.010 --> 11:31.317
Sage.

11:31.317 --> 11:32.884
-Daniel.
-Don't move.

11:32.884 --> 11:34.712
-You're gonna get us killed.
-Back away from him.

11:34.712 --> 11:37.758
I said I'm going to go look
for my daughter,

11:37.758 --> 11:39.238
and you're gonna
let us out.

11:39.238 --> 11:40.674
I said
back away from him.

11:40.674 --> 11:42.458
It's okay, Sage.
I got this.

11:49.378 --> 11:50.902
I will kill you.

11:50.902 --> 11:53.034
Go ahead.

11:53.034 --> 11:54.079
Do it.

11:59.084 --> 12:01.086
Ooh.

12:03.871 --> 12:05.568
You're out of bullets?

12:05.568 --> 12:06.656
Hard to come by
these days.

12:08.963 --> 12:10.312
Shut up, old man.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.879
See, empty clips,
they work on people,

12:11.879 --> 12:14.534
but the dead,
they don't scare so easily.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.449
And they won't help us
get that Tower.

12:19.844 --> 12:22.672
We heard radio chatter
from the sub.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.979
You really should stop
broadcasting your plans.

12:27.808 --> 12:31.029
We know you found
a weapons cache,

12:31.029 --> 12:32.639
but we don't know
the coordinates.

12:32.639 --> 12:34.162
And we're not
gonna tell you.

12:34.162 --> 12:35.685
Hmm.

12:35.685 --> 12:37.296
Then you'll end up
down there.

12:42.736 --> 12:44.042
The Abigail.

12:47.306 --> 12:49.656
Ofelia.

12:49.656 --> 12:51.310
Quit daydreaming.

12:51.310 --> 12:52.877
Save him for last.

12:54.922 --> 12:57.664
This one's first.

13:18.685 --> 13:20.078
Daniel.

13:37.922 --> 13:39.097
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:41.795 --> 13:43.188
No, no.

13:44.232 --> 13:45.973
No, no, no, no, no.
Daniel.

13:45.973 --> 13:47.453
Guard!
Daniel.

14:01.771 --> 14:03.425
This better be good.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.079
I would like to speak
to the man in charge.

14:05.079 --> 14:06.864
I have some information
that he needs.

14:08.778 --> 14:11.042
If you're playing another trick,
we'll throw you to the 'posters.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.871
I don't play tricks
with my daughter's life.

14:16.134 --> 14:18.353
Wait.

14:18.353 --> 14:20.965
I need to come, too.
It's the only way this works.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.185
His English is not as good
as it used to.

14:24.185 --> 14:25.883
You're gonna need me
to translate.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.596
No.

15:02.136 --> 15:03.833
Hmm.

15:18.892 --> 15:21.503
Alright, let's move.
Both of you.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.635
No.
SÃ­.

15:22.635 --> 15:23.679
Daniel.

15:23.679 --> 15:25.246
Daniel.

15:34.168 --> 15:36.431
What -- What the hell
are you doing?

15:36.431 --> 15:39.086
Let me out of here!
Let me out!

15:39.086 --> 15:40.566
Whoa.

15:40.566 --> 15:42.698
Where are the weapons?

15:42.698 --> 15:45.179
Oh. I'm not
telling you shit.

15:45.179 --> 15:46.702
Alright, we'll see
if you change your mind

15:46.702 --> 15:48.922
once you're, uh,
down there with them.

15:50.968 --> 15:52.491
Last chance.

15:52.491 --> 15:54.014
I told you --
I'm not telling you shit.

15:54.014 --> 15:55.537
I'm not betraying
my people.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.757
What about Derek?

15:57.757 --> 15:58.845
What about him?

15:58.845 --> 16:00.281
You betrayed him.

16:00.281 --> 16:03.589
Your brother found me,
brought me into the fold.

16:03.589 --> 16:06.157
So?
S-So?

16:06.157 --> 16:09.247
So he was my friend,
and you killed him.

16:09.247 --> 16:10.988
He was my brother.
Okay?

16:10.988 --> 16:13.033
I loved him.

16:13.033 --> 16:15.296
But he killed a lot
of my friends, and he
was gonna kill more.

16:15.296 --> 16:17.820
Yeah, but you would've
been alive with us.

16:18.908 --> 16:20.693
You obviously
chose wrong.

16:22.825 --> 16:24.697
But you have another choice
right now.

16:26.742 --> 16:30.920
Answer the question...
or die ugly.

16:33.227 --> 16:35.360
No. No.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.404
Where are the weapons?!

16:39.625 --> 16:42.106
Like I said
the first time --

16:42.106 --> 16:44.717
I'm not telling you shit.

16:44.717 --> 16:46.806
Alright.
You know what?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.373
I would've done this
anyway.

16:50.462 --> 16:52.377
Wait!

16:52.377 --> 16:53.595
What the hell?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.684
The old man wants
to make a deal.

16:55.684 --> 16:57.382
-Luce?
-I know.

17:04.911 --> 17:06.652
Let him out,
and then we talk.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.524
In case you hadn't noticed,
we have the leverage here.

17:09.524 --> 17:11.439
You think
that's gonna work?

17:11.439 --> 17:13.354
I know
how to make people talk,

17:13.354 --> 17:17.097
and I'm telling you,
that's not gonna do it.

17:17.097 --> 17:18.751
It's worked so far.

17:18.751 --> 17:20.927
You probably kill everybody
who gets in there.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.191
You kill us,

17:24.191 --> 17:25.671
you have nothing.

17:27.325 --> 17:29.327
You really know where
the weapons are, old man?

17:29.327 --> 17:30.632
I do.

17:35.768 --> 17:37.117
What do you want
in return?

17:37.117 --> 17:39.728
My daughter.

17:39.728 --> 17:41.121
Your daughter?

17:41.121 --> 17:42.209
Ofelia.

17:42.209 --> 17:43.863
Okay.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.430
Where is she?

17:45.430 --> 17:48.389
She's in that yacht.
The Abigail.

17:49.651 --> 17:53.177
Um...

17:53.177 --> 17:55.179
Yeah, I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:55.179 --> 17:56.441
Oh,
but I think you do.

17:56.441 --> 17:58.312
And I want
my daughter back!

17:58.312 --> 18:00.488
Can't we just
throw him over?
Wait. Wait!

18:03.535 --> 18:05.145
Let him go.

18:09.628 --> 18:11.020
You're right.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.544
Maybe we do
have your daughter.

18:15.199 --> 18:16.852
Well,
now we can start talking.

18:16.852 --> 18:19.028
Hey, don't do this.

18:19.028 --> 18:20.813
He doesn't know where
the weapons are.

18:20.813 --> 18:23.163
He's having problems remembering
what's real and what isn't.

18:23.163 --> 18:24.295
Daniel...

18:33.434 --> 18:35.697
Oh, did you think that you could
get one over on me

18:35.697 --> 18:36.959
by speaking EspaÃ±ol?

18:36.959 --> 18:38.831
I'm not trying
to fool you.

18:38.831 --> 18:40.224
It grounds him.

18:40.224 --> 18:42.226
Grounds him.

19:03.943 --> 19:07.033
What you're doing to him
is not okay.

19:07.033 --> 19:09.253
Consigning us to a life
like this -- that's not okay.

19:09.253 --> 19:11.994
I've seen a helluva lot
worse places than this.

19:14.214 --> 19:16.260
You do know what's coming,
don't you?

19:20.264 --> 19:23.702
Alicia and Morgan -- they're
gonna get you all killed.

19:23.702 --> 19:24.790
Bullshit.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.008
Suit yourself.

19:26.008 --> 19:27.445
What is it?
What's coming?

19:33.277 --> 19:34.756
You know
what's gonna happen

19:34.756 --> 19:36.149
when he finds out
you're lying, right?

19:36.149 --> 19:37.977
I'm protecting
my people.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.848
The ones
Alicia couldn't.

19:56.082 --> 19:57.301
Daniel...

20:29.463 --> 20:32.814
Sage, send a patrol
to check them out.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.468
Wait.

20:48.177 --> 20:49.309
Let him out.

20:49.309 --> 20:50.832
Yeah, yeah.
Get him out.

20:53.444 --> 20:54.793
It's your lucky day.

20:56.534 --> 20:57.883
Hey, are you okay?
You bit?

20:57.883 --> 21:00.451
I'm f-- I'm fine, alright?
I'm fine.

21:00.451 --> 21:02.148
Hey.I would've died

21:02.148 --> 21:03.628
before I gave that asshole
what he wanted.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.327
Daniel.What did you just say?

21:07.327 --> 21:11.549
I said if you had died
at the hand of that man,

21:11.549 --> 21:12.637
you would have
been a fool.

21:14.726 --> 21:17.468
Okay, Daniel.
You know what?

21:17.468 --> 21:19.557
No. I'm sorry.
You -- You can't keep using

21:19.557 --> 21:21.646
whatever's going on in your head
as an excuse to hurt people.

21:24.649 --> 21:28.174
I've always done
what I needed to do.

21:28.174 --> 21:29.262
No one's
gonna get hurt.

21:31.220 --> 21:33.875
Our people can get killed
if these people get there first.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.790
That's not gonna happen.How do you know?

21:35.790 --> 21:37.270
Hmm?

21:37.270 --> 21:40.578
Because I gave him
the wrong coordinates.

21:40.578 --> 21:43.929
He just sent half of his people
20 miles in the wrong direction.

21:45.496 --> 21:47.324
So they're just gonna kill us
when they get back, right?

21:49.064 --> 21:51.153
We won't be here.

21:51.153 --> 21:54.940
That asshole sent half
of his patrol to the site.

21:54.940 --> 21:58.030
It takes like 24 hours
to get there and back.

22:01.468 --> 22:03.905
So, there's half
as many guards here, hmm?

22:03.905 --> 22:05.298
Right.

22:05.298 --> 22:07.953
And without weapons,
they can't stop us.

22:08.997 --> 22:10.956
Where the hell
did you get that?

22:10.956 --> 22:15.308
I got it from that idiot when
he shoved me against the wall.

22:17.397 --> 22:19.878
They're very badly trained,
these people.

22:22.576 --> 22:25.057
Daniel, are you sure
this is gonna work?

22:38.113 --> 22:40.638
Um...

23:26.118 --> 23:30.209
And now...let's get
the hell off this boat.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.961
Guard! Guard!

23:42.961 --> 23:44.441
Hey,
we need help in here!

23:45.616 --> 23:47.095
What now?
He collapsed.

23:47.095 --> 23:48.793
I told you
he wasn't doing well.

23:48.793 --> 23:50.229
Is he breathing?Don't just stand there.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.013
Come in and help us out.He's not breathing.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.624
If he turns,
it's on you.

23:55.756 --> 23:57.018
Back up!

23:57.018 --> 23:58.542
Is he even dead,
lady?

23:58.542 --> 24:00.152
Did you check
his pulse?

24:02.067 --> 24:03.721
Shit.

24:03.721 --> 24:05.810
That's what you get
for calling me an old man.

24:07.289 --> 24:08.856
Get up.

24:11.206 --> 24:12.817
Move.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.650
The Abigail.
The yacht.

24:19.650 --> 24:21.347
Take us there.

24:21.347 --> 24:23.175
Your daughter's not here.

24:23.175 --> 24:24.829
Where is she?

24:24.829 --> 24:26.787
I don't know, but I'm
telling you, she's not here.

24:26.787 --> 24:28.572
You're lying.
Take us there.

24:28.572 --> 24:29.964
We need to leave.

24:29.964 --> 24:34.491
We are not going anywhere
without Ofelia.

24:34.491 --> 24:36.580
You heard him.
Take us to the yacht.

24:36.580 --> 24:38.669
Move.

24:38.669 --> 24:41.019
What the hell?He won't leave
unless he sees the truth.

24:41.019 --> 24:42.411
Are we sure
this is a good idea?

24:42.411 --> 24:44.196
It's the only way
he will understand

24:44.196 --> 24:45.719
so we can
get out of here.

24:45.719 --> 24:46.938
Let's go.

24:52.509 --> 24:53.988
What was Arno
talking about?

24:53.988 --> 24:55.903
What's coming?

24:55.903 --> 24:57.383
Answer her.

24:57.383 --> 25:00.038
The dead. They're gathering
in one of the craters.

25:00.038 --> 25:01.909
Where the warhead
detonated?

25:01.909 --> 25:03.563
There's bad stuff
there.

25:03.563 --> 25:05.522
The 'posters --
they're more dangerous now.

25:05.522 --> 25:06.740
Yeah, but they're stuck
in a crater.

25:06.740 --> 25:07.915
Why is he
so scared of them?

25:07.915 --> 25:10.004
I-I don't know.

25:10.004 --> 25:11.484
He doesn't tell me much.

25:11.484 --> 25:13.051
He doesn't tell
any of us much.

25:26.412 --> 25:27.587
Where is she?

25:27.587 --> 25:30.285
I told you --
she's not here.

25:30.285 --> 25:33.419
Daniel. Daniel!
Don't do this!

25:33.419 --> 25:35.116
Are you working
for them now?No.

25:35.116 --> 25:38.076
She was never here.Arno said she was.

25:38.076 --> 25:40.687
Come on, man. Back off.Because he wanted to know
where the weapons are.

25:40.687 --> 25:43.995
You're all wrong.
You're all liars.

25:43.995 --> 25:46.258
That card was a message,

25:46.258 --> 25:47.607
and Ofelia is
on this boat.

25:47.607 --> 25:49.130
She's not.
I swear.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.437
We aren't exactly being quiet,
guys.

25:51.437 --> 25:53.439
Daniel, you need
to accept the truth.

25:53.439 --> 25:54.745
Ofelia died in Mexico.

25:54.745 --> 25:58.487
You told me
you buried her yourself.

25:58.487 --> 26:00.185
I'm sorry.
She's gone.

26:04.885 --> 26:07.018
I'm looking for her
to tell her who I am

26:07.018 --> 26:09.586
and apologize
for my lies.

26:09.586 --> 26:10.848
I know.

26:10.848 --> 26:12.327
That's what you wanted,

26:12.327 --> 26:14.416
what you still want.

26:14.416 --> 26:18.246
So much that your mind is
telling you that you can.

26:18.246 --> 26:19.857
But you can't.

26:23.425 --> 26:26.298
Is that why
I'm so confused?

26:26.298 --> 26:27.560
Yes.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.171
See?
It wasn't my idea to lie to you.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.217
I didn't know what he was doing.
I swear.

26:35.307 --> 26:36.482
You went along with it.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.182
A mind --

26:41.182 --> 26:44.055
it's a very fragile thing.

26:44.055 --> 26:45.883
Very easy to break.

26:45.883 --> 26:48.015
Very hard to
put back together.

26:48.015 --> 26:50.714
Wes,
I knew your brother.

26:50.714 --> 26:52.716
Wait. Did he know
I was at the oil field?

26:55.066 --> 26:56.284
What the hell, man?

26:56.284 --> 26:57.459
Daniel.

27:00.462 --> 27:02.029
That wasn't your call.

27:02.029 --> 27:05.337
You're better off not knowing
about your brother.

27:05.337 --> 27:09.558
The truth about people
is always disappointing.

27:09.558 --> 27:11.212
Trust me.

27:14.172 --> 27:16.565
Hey.
We gotta go.

27:23.921 --> 27:25.705
He's lost it, Luce.
He's gonna get us killed.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.510
Daniel.

27:48.510 --> 27:50.295
Daniel.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.036
Daniel!

28:11.882 --> 28:14.536
You okay?
You find anything?

28:14.536 --> 28:17.322
No.
Nothing that will hold.

28:21.587 --> 28:24.633
I'm sorry, Wes.

28:24.633 --> 28:26.592
I know what you were hoping
he would tell you.

28:29.203 --> 28:30.552
You don't.

28:34.078 --> 28:35.427
See, I was hoping
he would tell me

28:35.427 --> 28:39.344
that Derek knew
I was at Tank Town.

28:39.344 --> 28:40.954
That he launched
the attack anyway.

28:40.954 --> 28:43.740
Why?

28:43.740 --> 28:46.264
'Cause I killed him.

28:46.264 --> 28:50.703
And the only way
I can live with that

28:50.703 --> 28:52.923
and the only way I can

28:52.923 --> 28:54.751
not wake up every morning
for the rest of my life

28:54.751 --> 28:57.536
feeling like
a piece of shit...

28:57.536 --> 28:59.103
is if I knew
he deserved to die.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.806
I don't think that's gonna
make you feel better.

29:09.417 --> 29:11.028
'Cause of Daniel,
we won't know.

29:17.295 --> 29:18.818
Come on.

29:18.818 --> 29:20.646
There's gotta be another way
off this thing.

29:35.182 --> 29:37.054
That's the third one
today.

29:37.054 --> 29:40.884
They're building up
at the east gate.

29:40.884 --> 29:43.147
Draw 'em away and get
the body out of here.

29:45.497 --> 29:47.151
Thank you, Sabrina.

29:56.464 --> 29:58.858
Boo.

30:00.251 --> 30:01.556
Move.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.479
No, no!

30:13.655 --> 30:16.833
You're making a mistake.
No!

30:16.833 --> 30:19.139
Your mistake
was lying to me.

30:19.139 --> 30:20.488
You would do anything
to protect your daughter!

30:20.488 --> 30:22.664
I was doing the same
to protect my people!

30:22.664 --> 30:23.883
They are not
your family.

30:26.712 --> 30:29.019
No. No, no! No!

30:29.019 --> 30:30.672
Don't do this!

30:33.545 --> 30:36.069
I meant to tell you,
your Spanish is very good.

30:36.069 --> 30:38.811
No! No!
Your daughter,

30:38.811 --> 30:41.161
wherever she is,
she's better off without you!

30:46.993 --> 30:49.082
Oh, no! No!

30:49.082 --> 30:50.431
No! No!

31:02.966 --> 31:05.011
Daniel,
what are you doing?!

31:09.146 --> 31:10.756
Did you hear
what he said to me?

31:10.756 --> 31:12.801
You made me do this!

31:12.801 --> 31:15.152
Wes.
I'm already on it.

31:28.121 --> 31:29.122
Hey.

31:29.122 --> 31:31.864
Hey.

31:31.864 --> 31:36.173
There's no
new beginning.

31:36.173 --> 31:40.090
They're all gonna die
because of you.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.352
Who's gonna die?

31:43.180 --> 31:47.227
The people Alicia was supposed
to take care of.

31:47.227 --> 31:53.146
The ones
I prom-promised...

31:55.235 --> 31:57.194
The ones I...

31:57.194 --> 31:59.152
The ones I promised...

31:59.152 --> 32:00.545
Hey, listen to me.

32:00.545 --> 32:03.678
Listen to me!

32:03.678 --> 32:07.160
I'll make sure they're okay.
I promise.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.815
But you have to tell me
what's coming.

32:09.815 --> 32:11.512
So I can help them.

32:14.341 --> 32:18.345
The dead in the pit,
they're --

32:18.345 --> 32:19.346
they're escaping.

32:19.346 --> 32:20.782
Someone --

32:20.782 --> 32:23.307
Someone's
letting them out.

32:23.307 --> 32:25.135
You can't touch them.

32:25.135 --> 32:27.833
You can't even
go near them.

32:27.833 --> 32:29.748
You -- You --

32:29.748 --> 32:34.927
You have to -- have to get
everybody to the Tower.

32:34.927 --> 32:39.801
There's --
There's nowhere else --

32:39.801 --> 32:44.676
There's...nowhere else...

32:44.676 --> 32:47.200
nowhere else...

33:13.966 --> 33:16.360
He --
He said that Ofelia was alive.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.536
He lied to me.

33:18.536 --> 33:21.104
I know, Daniel.

33:21.104 --> 33:23.932
Look, I wouldn't lose sleep
over that asshole.

33:23.932 --> 33:26.065
He tried to
do the same to me.

33:29.199 --> 33:31.723
This is the second time
I almost got you killed.

33:31.723 --> 33:33.420
You should leave me here.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.031
No.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.862
What you did here...

33:40.862 --> 33:43.082
I understand
why you did it.

33:43.082 --> 33:46.172
But he manipulated you.

33:46.172 --> 33:47.913
That's why you
still need my help.

33:52.396 --> 33:54.180
No one knows
my real background,

33:54.180 --> 33:56.965
that part of my life that
Ofelia never understood

33:56.965 --> 33:58.793
and I could not
explain to her.

33:58.793 --> 34:00.578
But you do.

34:00.578 --> 34:02.449
You've seen it.

34:02.449 --> 34:04.234
And you're still here.
Why?

34:04.234 --> 34:05.974
We all make mistakes.

34:29.607 --> 34:31.391
Hey, Luce.

34:31.391 --> 34:33.698
Yeah?

34:33.698 --> 34:35.700
What are we gonna do
about everybody that lives here?

34:38.006 --> 34:41.140
I don't know.

34:41.140 --> 34:42.968
What are we gonna
do about them?

34:42.968 --> 34:45.753
You heard what he said.
Can't touch them.

34:45.753 --> 34:48.147
Can't get near them.

34:51.107 --> 34:53.326
We need to leave now.

34:53.326 --> 34:54.284
All of us.

35:10.343 --> 35:13.259
I know we've been enemies.

35:13.259 --> 35:17.829
I know some of you hurt people
we cared about.

35:17.829 --> 35:21.006
And we did the same
to you.

35:21.006 --> 35:23.313
We all need to
escape the dead,

35:23.313 --> 35:25.358
escape this land.

35:25.358 --> 35:28.274
We need each other now
more than ever.

35:28.274 --> 35:30.885
We need to fight Victor Strand
and take his Tower,

35:30.885 --> 35:34.237
and only then,
we will have a new life,

35:34.237 --> 35:36.848
a new beginning.

35:36.848 --> 35:40.068
Together.

35:40.068 --> 35:41.592
Who's with us?

35:47.902 --> 35:49.861
It's what Teddy
would've wanted.

35:51.645 --> 35:53.691
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:59.436 --> 36:01.394
You really think
we can trust them?

36:01.394 --> 36:04.876
I mean,
we killed their leader.

36:04.876 --> 36:06.704
These are the people
Alicia wanted to join us.

36:06.704 --> 36:09.533
And she couldn't convince them.She couldn't convince Arno.

36:11.622 --> 36:14.407
None of that will matter
once they realize

36:14.407 --> 36:17.062
you cannot deliver
what you just promised them.

36:20.021 --> 36:22.459
That's not true.

36:22.459 --> 36:26.680
We can take Strand's Tower
with their help.

36:26.680 --> 36:30.380
They couldn't get it
when they had a nuclear warhead.

36:30.380 --> 36:33.296
Because they didn't
have something we do.

36:33.296 --> 36:36.473
Someone who knows what Victor is
thinking before he does.

36:36.473 --> 36:39.040
You, Daniel.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.433
You can get us there.

36:40.433 --> 36:41.869
Me?
Yes.

36:43.958 --> 36:45.656
I can't even get simple things
straight.

36:48.006 --> 36:51.575
I lost my cat before
this damn mess began.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.970
I almost got us killed
when I left the submarine.

36:55.970 --> 36:59.931
You freed us from that prison,
made it to the yacht.

36:59.931 --> 37:02.934
How do you think you did that,
Daniel?

37:02.934 --> 37:05.632
Ofelia.

37:05.632 --> 37:07.286
When I was trying
to get her,

37:07.286 --> 37:09.810
suddenly,
everything became clear.

37:09.810 --> 37:12.335
My daughter gave me focus.
That's why.

37:20.125 --> 37:22.040
Hey, Luci.

37:31.832 --> 37:33.791
You're not thinking
what I think you are.

37:40.232 --> 37:41.973
All of these people

37:41.973 --> 37:43.453
and everyone
back at the sub

37:43.453 --> 37:45.368
are depending on us
to make it to the Tower.

37:45.368 --> 37:48.284
Right, we'll find a way.This is the only way.

37:48.284 --> 37:49.850
Strand outsmarted everyone else
so far.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.156
Luciana --

37:51.156 --> 37:52.375
If Daniel's out there
any longer,

37:52.375 --> 37:54.072
he's gonna
get himself killed.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.204
You gotta be kidding me.

37:56.204 --> 37:57.336
Wes, please.

37:57.336 --> 37:59.817
No, I-I-I can't, Luce.

37:59.817 --> 38:01.253
Wes.

38:03.777 --> 38:05.257
Wes.

38:08.695 --> 38:10.262
What's wrong with him?

38:26.409 --> 38:29.020
Arno told me something
before he died.

38:29.020 --> 38:30.456
What?

38:36.332 --> 38:39.465
Ofelia's alive
and he told me where she is.

38:44.383 --> 38:45.776
You told me
she was dead.

38:45.776 --> 38:48.169
I know, because that's
what I thought.

38:48.169 --> 38:49.780
But he knew
where she was.

38:49.780 --> 38:51.042
Where?

38:53.349 --> 38:54.959
Strand has her
in the Tower.

38:59.050 --> 39:00.617
Why didn't you
tell me before?

39:00.617 --> 39:03.228
Because I was afraid that
you would go there alone

39:03.228 --> 39:05.186
and get yourself killed
trying to get in.

39:05.186 --> 39:06.753
And why are you
telling me now?

39:18.461 --> 39:22.247
Because of what you did here,
Daniel.

39:22.247 --> 39:25.555
If knowing Ofelia's alive
gives you clarity,

39:25.555 --> 39:28.035
then you can lead
all these people

39:28.035 --> 39:29.994
and take the Tower
from Strand.

39:37.741 --> 39:39.699
I want to believe this,

39:39.699 --> 39:42.746
but my mind is not clear.

39:45.575 --> 39:48.447
You must be certain,
Luciana.

39:51.407 --> 39:54.671
Because if you're wrong,

39:54.671 --> 39:58.544
if this is not true,

39:58.544 --> 40:01.808
if this is another lie,

40:01.808 --> 40:04.637
it could break me
for good.

40:09.729 --> 40:11.339
Are you sure?

40:14.517 --> 40:16.127
It is true, Daniel.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.441
Then we'll get
in the Tower.

40:25.441 --> 40:27.355
Mm-hmm.

40:27.355 --> 40:29.749
And Ofelia,
you, and me,

40:29.749 --> 40:32.491
we'll be together,
always.

40:34.493 --> 40:36.060
Right?
Yeah.

40:45.199 --> 40:48.464
They're ready to go.

40:48.464 --> 40:49.943
Let's head out.

40:52.859 --> 40:56.907
You know,
Derek and I --

40:56.907 --> 41:00.911
we had this thing we used
to say to each other --

41:00.911 --> 41:04.044
people are people.

41:04.044 --> 41:06.482
What does that mean?It means people suck.

41:07.874 --> 41:09.963
You know,
Strand and Alicia

41:09.963 --> 41:12.879
tried to make me see things
differently when they found me.

41:12.879 --> 41:15.708
And they did,
for a little while.

41:15.708 --> 41:18.189
But, I mean,
look at them now.

41:18.189 --> 41:20.452
They're at
each other's throats.

41:20.452 --> 41:22.367
And Morgan

41:22.367 --> 41:24.674
man,
he hasn't done much better.

41:27.372 --> 41:30.897
But what you were doing
for Daniel --

41:30.897 --> 41:33.291
I don't know, that made me
want to believe that,

41:33.291 --> 41:35.989
you know,
people weren't always people.

41:35.989 --> 41:38.557
I might've been wrong.

41:38.557 --> 41:40.341
There might just be some kind
of hope left for all of us.

41:40.341 --> 41:41.342
Wes --
No.

41:41.342 --> 41:44.041
Let me finish.

41:44.041 --> 41:45.433
What you just did is proof

41:45.433 --> 41:46.957
that y'all are no better
than the rest of us.

41:46.957 --> 41:49.350
I'm sorry, Wes.
That's not what this is.

41:49.350 --> 41:50.874
Well, take this.
What?

41:50.874 --> 41:53.311
So you can
get everybody to the sub.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.009
Why?
I'm not going with you.

41:56.009 --> 41:58.925
Wes, don't do this.

41:58.925 --> 42:01.188
Good luck, Luci.

42:01.188 --> 42:02.973
Where are you gonna go?

42:02.973 --> 42:04.235
I don't know.

42:06.324 --> 42:11.198
But what I do know is

42:11.198 --> 42:13.157
I can't be around somebody

42:13.157 --> 42:15.159
pretending to be something
that they're not.

42:17.378 --> 42:21.165
And Daniel,
he's confused.

42:21.165 --> 42:22.253
And he's not right,

42:22.253 --> 42:25.169
but he can't help it.

42:26.823 --> 42:29.739
But you --

42:29.739 --> 42:31.479
you know exactly
what you're doing.

42:38.051 --> 42:39.792
What happened?

42:39.792 --> 42:43.404
Where is he going now?

42:43.404 --> 42:45.363
Should we go after him?

42:45.363 --> 42:47.278
No.

42:47.278 --> 42:49.149
I don't think
he will change his mind.

42:54.415 --> 42:56.940
That's a lot of heat.

42:56.940 --> 42:59.116
Yeah.
Just glad it worked out.

42:59.116 --> 43:00.639
It more than worked out.

43:00.639 --> 43:03.337
This could make
all the difference.

43:03.337 --> 43:05.601
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a start, for sure.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.299
Let's take an inventory.

43:09.692 --> 43:11.955
Now we just need, uh,
soldiers to carry 'em.

43:14.348 --> 43:16.089
Luci's back.

43:16.089 --> 43:17.438
Hey.
-With Daniel?

43:17.438 --> 43:18.701
Did she find him?

43:18.701 --> 43:20.746
Not just Daniel.

43:20.746 --> 43:22.313
Arno's people.

43:24.620 --> 43:26.273
They want to help us.

43:26.273 --> 43:28.275
Hey.

43:28.275 --> 43:30.364
No Wes?

43:30.364 --> 43:31.801
He's not coming,
Morgan.

43:31.801 --> 43:32.889
But he's okay?

43:32.889 --> 43:34.673
I hope so.

43:34.673 --> 43:36.240
I think
he needs some time.

43:40.070 --> 43:43.203
You found the weapons.

43:43.203 --> 43:44.814
It's okay.

43:46.816 --> 43:48.861
Yes, we did.

43:48.861 --> 43:51.298
Well, now, all we need to do
is start planning

43:51.298 --> 43:53.257
how to overthrow
Victor Strand.

44:21.198 --> 44:23.374
I need to talk to Victor.

44:23.374 --> 44:25.202
Who is this?

44:25.202 --> 44:28.553
Tell him it's Wes.

44:28.553 --> 44:30.555
Tell him
I want to make a deal.

44:30.555 --> 44:32.644
Why would he want to
make a deal with you?

44:35.691 --> 44:38.302
Because I can help
save his Tower.

44:41.740 --> 44:43.089
What do you mean,
she's missing?

44:43.220 --> 44:44.438
Infants don't just vanish
into thin air.

44:44.569 --> 44:46.223
She wasn't in her crib.I will find her.

44:46.353 --> 44:49.226
I told you
I needed the right opportunity.

44:49.356 --> 44:50.749
I think I just found it.

44:50.880 --> 44:52.011
Come in.

44:53.186 --> 44:54.840
Of course I'd be
the first person he'd suspect.

44:56.537 --> 44:58.583
What makes you think
Victor won't change you?

44:58.714 --> 45:00.498
You said
you believed in this place.

45:00.628 --> 45:01.673
Show me.

45:32.617 --> 45:35.098
Daniel is still
very much suffering from

45:35.228 --> 45:38.623
the memory loss that he's been
experiencing due to

45:38.754 --> 45:41.757
the post traumatic stress of
everything that's gone on

45:41.887 --> 45:43.323
with him in the apocalypse.

45:43.454 --> 45:46.152
And one of the things that often
happens is that

45:46.283 --> 45:49.286
the past can, in many ways,
seem more real than the present.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.897
And it felt like there being
a small trigger like seeing

45:52.028 --> 45:54.726
something that put him in the
mind space of when he was with

45:54.857 --> 45:58.643
his daughter, something like the
memory card with the boat on it.

45:58.774 --> 46:01.428
So that really is kind of
the present state of mind

46:01.559 --> 46:04.431
he's living in, even though
it doesn't really logically

46:04.562 --> 46:06.651
make sense with the reality
around him.

46:06.782 --> 46:10.002
But that kind of inner drive
to fix that thing

46:10.133 --> 46:13.049
he didn't get to do before his
daughter died is something

46:13.179 --> 46:15.442
that drives him out into this
very inhospitable world.

46:19.751 --> 46:21.274
Ah!

46:21.405 --> 46:25.061
The thing that's driving Daniel
is so important to him

46:25.191 --> 46:27.411
that he's willing to fight
through everything out there

46:27.541 --> 46:29.892
to try to get the chance
to find Ofelia again.

46:33.156 --> 46:35.985
He's not saying
what I think he's saying?

46:42.992 --> 46:45.255
One of the things that we see
happen with Daniel

46:45.385 --> 46:48.824
in this episode is that many of
these skills that he gained

46:48.954 --> 46:51.957
very early in his life,
his skills as a soldier,

46:52.088 --> 46:55.265
his skills in spy craft, there's
kind of a muscle memory there.

46:55.395 --> 46:58.181
And again, it's the past that's
much more easily accessible,

46:58.311 --> 47:00.879
so those are the things that are
kind of at his fingertips,

47:01.010 --> 47:03.447
those reflexes that
just kick in.

47:05.231 --> 47:06.711
-Daniel.
-Don't move.

47:06.842 --> 47:08.452
-You're gonna get us killed.
-Back away from him.

47:08.582 --> 47:10.758
I said I'm going to go look
for my daughter,

47:10.889 --> 47:12.630
and you're gonna
let us out.

47:12.760 --> 47:15.633
It's almost like his
super powers are activated,

47:15.763 --> 47:18.897
but they're activated in such
a way that he is using them for

47:19.028 --> 47:21.073
a mission that
can't be completed,

47:21.204 --> 47:23.815
and it kind of puts him this
very dangerous place.

47:23.946 --> 47:26.557
Go ahead.

47:26.687 --> 47:29.038
Do it.

47:30.778 --> 47:31.867
Ooh.

47:32.955 --> 47:34.652
Luciana and Wes

47:34.782 --> 47:38.351
go back and forth between being
both very impressed by

47:38.482 --> 47:40.571
what Daniel is capable of,
but at the same time

47:40.701 --> 47:42.007
very worried about it.

47:42.138 --> 47:43.748
You can't keep using

47:43.879 --> 47:45.881
whatever's going on in your head
as an excuse to hurt people.

47:46.490 --> 47:49.058
I've always done
what I needed to do.

47:49.188 --> 47:50.624
No one's
gonna get hurt.

47:50.755 --> 47:52.713
And as we see over
the course of the episode,

47:52.844 --> 47:55.151
he just keeps getting them into,
you know,

47:55.281 --> 47:58.371
deeper and deeper trouble,
and it does feel like

47:58.502 --> 48:00.547
he is going to get
all of them killed.

48:00.678 --> 48:01.984
Where is she?

48:02.114 --> 48:03.724
I told you.
She's not here.

48:03.855 --> 48:05.901
All because he has this belief
that his daughter

48:06.031 --> 48:08.077
is being held prisoner on a boat
on the other side

48:08.207 --> 48:12.429
of the graveyard and really
setting the question

48:12.559 --> 48:16.650
for Luciana, which is, how could
you channel this into

48:16.781 --> 48:20.437
an effective way of combating
Arno and his people

48:20.567 --> 48:23.701
and then help Daniel become
an effective ally

48:23.831 --> 48:25.355
in taking down Strand.

48:26.660 --> 48:28.880
You have another
choice right now.

48:30.403 --> 48:33.406
Answer the question...

48:33.537 --> 48:35.278
or die ugly.

48:35.408 --> 48:37.280
Arno is
an interesting character

48:37.410 --> 48:41.197
because if we think about his
kind of back story,

48:41.327 --> 48:45.549
he was a true believer in Teddy,
and despite, you know,

48:45.679 --> 48:48.987
how crazy Teddy was and the fact
that he brought about

48:49.118 --> 48:51.511
a second apocalypse in the
middle of the zombie apocalypse,

48:51.642 --> 48:54.732
in his own twisted way, he did
think this was the best way

48:54.862 --> 48:56.690
forward for his survivors.

48:56.821 --> 48:59.432
He did care about them a lot,
and Arno I think really wants

48:59.563 --> 49:01.826
to protect all the people
under his care.

49:01.957 --> 49:04.263
She's the one we've been
waiting for.

49:04.394 --> 49:06.483
That's gonna lead us to
our new beginning.

49:06.613 --> 49:08.615
I'm not living
with psychos anyway.

49:08.746 --> 49:11.531
He, in many ways, wants to do
what Teddy thought Alicia

49:11.662 --> 49:13.359
could do, which was
take care of everyone.

49:13.490 --> 49:16.058
And from Arno's point of view,
Alicia failed them all.

49:16.188 --> 49:17.755
So he's stepping
in to do that.

49:17.885 --> 49:20.279
There's no
new beginning.

49:20.410 --> 49:24.240
They're all gonna die
because of you.

49:24.370 --> 49:25.763
Who's gonna die?

49:25.893 --> 49:28.331
The people Alicia was supposed
to take care of.

49:28.461 --> 49:31.508
He wants to do right by
all of the Stalkers

49:31.638 --> 49:34.641
just as badly as Luciana
and Daniel and Wes

49:34.772 --> 49:36.817
want to help everyone
on the submarine.

49:44.825 --> 49:47.176
Luciana is faced with this
really hard choice,

49:47.306 --> 49:50.918
and she spent the entire episode
really being angry that

49:51.049 --> 49:52.442
Arno is manipulating Daniel.

49:52.572 --> 49:55.619
And she ultimately makes
the very tough call that

49:55.749 --> 49:59.057
in order to save Daniel
and save everyone else,

49:59.188 --> 50:02.017
she may have to sacrifice
the thing that she just gained,

50:02.147 --> 50:03.714
the thing that
means so much to her,

50:03.844 --> 50:05.672
and that's her relationship
with Daniel.

50:05.803 --> 50:08.458
Ofelia's alive
and he told me where she is.

50:09.633 --> 50:11.765
Strand has her
in the tower.

50:11.896 --> 50:16.335
She tells him this lie that is
a very painful thing to watch

50:16.466 --> 50:17.728
because we know the truth.

50:17.858 --> 50:20.165
In Luciana's mind,
she is thinking about

50:20.296 --> 50:21.688
the long game here.

50:21.819 --> 50:24.387
And I'm not just talking
practically in terms of

50:24.517 --> 50:25.953
who is in the tower
and who is not,

50:26.084 --> 50:28.391
but I think in her mind,
she thinks if she can get

50:28.521 --> 50:31.524
everyone into the tower,
if Daniel can live

50:31.655 --> 50:34.745
in a place like that, then she
can repair the relationship

50:34.875 --> 50:37.008
and they can rebuild.

50:37.139 --> 50:40.359
Derek and I --
we had this thing

50:40.490 --> 50:42.840
we used to say
to each other --

50:42.970 --> 50:45.973
people are people.

50:46.104 --> 50:47.932
What does that mean?It means people suck.

50:48.063 --> 50:50.717
When Luciana makes the decision
to lie to Daniel,

50:50.848 --> 50:52.197
it really is the last straw.

50:52.328 --> 50:54.547
It's the thing that
makes Wes say, like,

50:54.678 --> 50:57.507
"Wait a second, everything that
everyone's been telling me..."

50:57.637 --> 51:00.988
he now thinks that's
all just hypocritical lies.

51:01.119 --> 51:02.425
What you just did is proof

51:02.555 --> 51:03.904
that y'all are no better
than the rest of us.

51:04.035 --> 51:06.342
I'm sorry, Wes.
That's not what this is.

51:06.472 --> 51:07.952
Well, take this.
What?

51:08.083 --> 51:10.389
So you can
get everybody to the sub.

51:10.520 --> 51:12.261
Why?
I'm not going with you.

51:12.391 --> 51:13.958
Wes, don't do this.

51:14.089 --> 51:16.569
And he's essentially in this
place where he's saying,

51:16.700 --> 51:18.093
"You know what,
I've had enough of this.

51:18.223 --> 51:20.486
I would rather be with
someone who is at least

51:20.617 --> 51:22.532
owning what they do."

51:22.662 --> 51:25.187
And ultimately,
that drives him to the call box.

51:25.317 --> 51:27.406
I need to talk to Victor.

51:27.537 --> 51:28.886
Who is this?

51:29.016 --> 51:32.194
Tell him it's Wes.

51:32.324 --> 51:34.544
Tell him
I want to make a deal.
