do all the work by themselves.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.972
Yeah? Well, you're just in time to leave.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.099
Now, get off my property, the lot of you!

20:26.516 --> 20:28.268
Xerxes and I have got work to do.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.979
We can't leave.
We still owe you for the window.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.274
And we're gonna be working right here
by your side till we pay it off.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.526
Yeah, working and singing

20:36.610 --> 20:38.111
and smiling and...

20:38.612 --> 20:39.613
and...

20:39.696 --> 20:41.823
-Puppet shows?
-Yes!

20:41.907 --> 20:44.952
We're going to do puppet shows
day and night till we pay off what we owe.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.162
Never mind! Never mind.
The window was an accident.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.830
You don't owe me nothing.

[Lucky gasps]

20:50.874 --> 20:52.084
Wait a minute.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.669
If the window was an accident,

20:53.752 --> 20:55.545
then it seems to me that you owe us

20:55.629 --> 20:56.880
for three days of labor.

20:58.173 --> 20:59.591
No, no. No, you see here--

20:59.675 --> 21:03.595
Abigail, don't you know a song
about fairness that you could teach us?

21:03.679 --> 21:04.763
Sure, I do!

-Fine! Take it!
-[gasps]

21:11.561 --> 21:13.647
Just get off my property
and don't come back.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.691
-[laughs] Yes!
-Yeah!

21:15.774 --> 21:16.775
Whoo!

21:17.150 --> 21:19.486
Let's go, PALs. Our work here is done.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.322
[Abigail] What just happened?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.450
We wanted to make Grayson pay
for how he treated you.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.077
Aw! That's OK.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.956
It doesn't matter if Grayson's nice,
because I'm nice, and that's what counts.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.333
Besides,
I don't need to be friends with him.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.544
I already have
the best friends in the world.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.045
-Ow!
-[crows cawing]

21:39.339 --> 21:40.757
You guys aren't too bad, either.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.093
You might not have
gotten through to Grayson,

21:43.176 --> 21:45.554
but it looks like Lucky
got through to Xerxes.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.598
Here we go, Xerxes.
I need one thing going right today.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.812
Hey! [laughs]

21:53.895 --> 21:56.648
How did you learn to do that,
you smart old thing?

21:56.732 --> 21:58.734
Good boy! Good, Xerxes!

21:58.817 --> 21:59.901
[laughs]

21:59.985 --> 22:03.363
Abigail, it worked! Grayson's being nice!

22:03.447 --> 22:05.824
I can't believe you actually changed him.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.368
Of course I did.
How could you have ever doubted me?

22:08.452 --> 22:10.454
[laughs] Let's go celebrate.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.664
[chuckles] And I know just how to do it.
