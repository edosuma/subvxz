WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.916
You're a liar.
I think you enjoyed it.

00:03.916 --> 00:06.223
I don't believe one word that
comes out of your mouth, Paul.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.269
<i>Abigail! Wait, what?
What did you say?</i>

00:08.269 --> 00:09.879
<i>I've gotten, like,
three phone calls--</i>

00:09.879 --> 00:12.055
That maybe you shouldn't have
banged our personal trainer.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.970
Calm down.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.406
I mean, do you realize
you're stirring up

00:15.406 --> 00:16.190
- a lot of trouble for me?
<i>- I want out.</i>

00:16.190 --> 00:17.756
Today.
Don't come home.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.889
<i>And what are you gonna
tell Emma, huh?</i>

00:19.889 --> 00:21.978
That her father can't keep it
in his pants.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.327
No, no, no.
Listen to me.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.894
You are not going to use
our daughter as a weapon.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.200
<i>Don't test me.
If you want this to get ugly,</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:28.332
<i>- I can make this ugly.</i>
- Paul, shut up.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.118
<i>- What?</i>
- Somebody broke into the house.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.728
Don't go in.
Go back to your car.

00:32.728 --> 00:33.816
I'm--
I'm calling the police.

00:33.816 --> 00:36.210
<i>Do not go in!
Do not!</i>

00:36.210 --> 00:37.776
- What about Emma?
<i>- Go sit in your car.</i>

00:37.776 --> 00:40.127
<i>Abigail, for once in your life,
just listen to me.</i>

00:40.127 --> 00:42.346
<i>Abigail!
Listen to me!</i>

00:42.346 --> 00:43.391
<i>Go back to your car.</i>

00:43.391 --> 00:45.523
<i>Abigail!</i>

00:51.312 --> 00:53.357
Emma...

01:03.759 --> 01:05.195
Emma?

01:12.115 --> 01:13.377
No! No!

01:23.996 --> 01:25.346
Ah!

02:18.312 --> 02:19.748
Name?

02:22.098 --> 02:25.101
- Special Agent Will Trent.
- Ooh. Fancy.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.537
See, I wouldn't
have guessed that.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.060
I would have said professor.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.411
Why is there a form?
My neighbor died three days ago.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.326
This dog was tied up
in her backyard.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.241
- I'm just dropping her off.
- Just dropping her?

02:34.241 --> 02:36.460
Like a sack of old clothes?

02:36.460 --> 02:37.983
You folks work with animals
'cause you don't get along

02:37.983 --> 02:39.550
with people?
I rescued a dog.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.162
That's universally accepted
as a good deed.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.467
Special Agent Trent
wants a parade.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.121
No, I don't want a parade.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.818
I just want to get on
with my day.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.994
You folks rehome animals, so...

02:48.994 --> 02:50.300
rehome.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.084
Tag says her name
is Betty.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.216
You think she's named
after Betty White?

02:53.216 --> 02:55.305
- I have no idea.
- Uh, wait!

02:55.305 --> 02:58.134
W-- W-- We need your signature
on the release.

03:01.877 --> 03:05.185
Just take her.
Y-You seem nice.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.274
Tolerant is not the same
as nice.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.493
Where do I sign?

03:09.493 --> 03:12.496
Oh, there is tons of articles
about you.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.019
You just brought down
a bunch of corrupt cops.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.325
Fight the power, man.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.935
- That's kind of hot.
- It's really not.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.546
Very unpopular position
to take, actually.

03:18.546 --> 03:21.201
- Are we good?
- And your initials.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.464
Uh, maybe your wife
could look after her?

03:23.464 --> 03:25.379
- Not married.
- Girlfriend?

03:25.379 --> 03:26.597
Boyfriend?

03:26.597 --> 03:29.252
It's just me, okay?
I-I've done my duty.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.298
Thank you
for whatever this was.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.516
This is a no-kill shelter, right?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.475
I mean, mostly.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.572
<i>♪ Well, you come upstairs,
but not to talk♪</i>

03:44.572 --> 03:46.095
<i>♪ You stay a little while♪</i>

03:46.095 --> 03:48.880
<i>♪ Then you do a little
walk on home♪</i>

03:51.622 --> 03:54.059
<i>♪ Well, I don't care,

03:54.059 --> 03:57.280

<i>♪ Pass me whatever

04:16.473 --> 04:18.345
<i>♪ Well, I don't care
if it's seven in...♪</i>

04:28.050 --> 04:30.444
What's up with the dog?
And what happened to your car?

04:32.184 --> 04:34.230
This is Betty.
I'm adopting her.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.884
As you can see,
I'm overjoyed about it.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.669
And I think it's pretty clear to
see that my car was vandalized.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.933
That's what you get
for turning on your own.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.935
You assigned me that case.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.546
You could've said no.

04:45.546 --> 04:46.634
What are you doing here?

04:46.634 --> 04:48.549
APD caught a body.
Get in.

04:48.549 --> 04:52.117
Gotta put the dog
in the house.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.206
Why is the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation

04:54.206 --> 04:55.947
getting involved
in a homicide?

04:55.947 --> 04:57.645
We're here as a courtesy.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.168
Murdered teenage girl.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.648
Home invasion
in Ansley Park.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.215
So unless there's evidence
of a contract killing,

05:03.215 --> 05:06.131
we leave it to the APD,
and we get the hell out.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.872
Courtesy?
A courtesy to who?

05:07.872 --> 05:10.353
Victim's grandfather is a
billionaire named Hoyt Bentley.

05:10.353 --> 05:13.008
He called the governor,
who then called me.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.270
Oh, the governor.
That's right.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.967
You have an unreasonable boss, too.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.537
I told him
I'd bring my best.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.322
I just need you to read
the crime scene, Will.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.936
Yes, ma'am.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.154
You feel that?

05:29.154 --> 05:30.547
What?

05:30.547 --> 05:32.680
All that hatred for you?

05:32.680 --> 05:33.942
It's like heat.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.596
Wish we could harness it.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.380
Solve climate change.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.555
Hey, walk past the cameras
so the governor sees you.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.956
Heads up.
The GBI's here.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.436
OFFICER ♪2:
Get lost, rat.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.046
OFFICER ♪3: Scumbags.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.185
Morning, fellas.

06:00.185 --> 06:03.232
How's it going,
rat punk?

06:03.232 --> 06:05.365
Come on, Trent.
Doesn't take a genius.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.541
They broke the window,
unlocked the door.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.632
Special Agent Trent,
case notes.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.243
Home invasion point of entry--
front door.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.507
Method of access--
absolutely 100%

06:17.507 --> 06:19.248
not what the APD
has concluded.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.039
The hell
is the GBI doing here?

06:28.039 --> 06:29.737
Assessing the situation.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.609
The situation is there's a bunch
of uniforms outside

06:32.609 --> 06:34.742
plotting your murder.
Look at you.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.221
Always with
the three-piece suit,

06:36.221 --> 06:38.136
like every day's
your wedding day.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.399
Or my funeral.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.705
[laughing] Hey, a joke.
I like it.

06:41.705 --> 06:44.621
Throw in a smile,
you might make some friends.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.407
This one's
pretty self-explanatory.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.191
Atlanta PD's got it covered.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.584
- Who's this?
- The perp.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.455
- And this?
- The daughter's footprint.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.152
Body's upstairs.
It's a real mess up there.

06:54.152 --> 06:55.371
You don't want
to get involved.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.503
Why don't you just take me
through it,

06:56.503 --> 06:58.592
and I'll get out your hair?

06:58.592 --> 07:01.203
Mom comes home from tennis,
door's open.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.423
Window next to the door knob's
smashed.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.382
She goes upstairs,
sees her daughter,

07:06.382 --> 07:08.428
probably raped,
definitely murdered,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.386
the perp standing
over her with a knife.

07:10.386 --> 07:14.521
Perp sets his sights on mom--
who's smoking hot by the way--

07:14.521 --> 07:18.176
a big, dirty fight ensues,
but all that pilates pays off

07:18.176 --> 07:21.136
because mom ends up
strangling him to death.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.181
I know, surprise ending.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.793
Anyway, the case is solved,
and there's your do-er.

07:25.793 --> 07:30.232
- 'Kay. You ID him yet?
- Waiting for the M.E.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.538
How big's the mother?

07:31.538 --> 07:33.540
I dunno,
rich white lady size.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.367
Hundred pounds soaking wet.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.805
Probably carries her intestines
around in her purse.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.546
How's she the one
who walks away?

07:39.546 --> 07:41.286
Adrenaline.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.767
You know, when the mom lifts
the car off the baby?

07:43.767 --> 07:45.377
I got an answer
for everything.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.814
Boom!

07:46.814 --> 07:48.163
Great.
We're good to go.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.817
Thank you very much.
Case closed!

07:49.817 --> 07:53.473
Except...

07:53.473 --> 07:55.387
broken window's too far away
to reach the doorknob.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.519
Can you explain that?

07:57.694 --> 08:00.088
Think on it for a minute.
Get back to me.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.785
Where's the mother?

08:01.785 --> 08:03.961
Giving a statement
to my partner, Faith.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.441
Well, is there anyone
we can call for you

08:05.441 --> 08:07.138
or somewhere you could go?

08:07.138 --> 08:10.228
I don't want to leave
while my daughter's here.

08:10.228 --> 08:13.841
- I can't. I need to--
- I would feel the same way.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.321
I am so sorry for your loss.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.802
Mrs. Campano, this is Eric.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.238
He's an EMT.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.414
He's gonna check you out
for a concussion, okay?

08:25.461 --> 08:28.377
Thanks, Detective.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.292
Hi, Mrs. Campano.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.948
What is he doing here?

08:33.948 --> 08:35.340
Who do you think
you're talking to?

08:35.340 --> 08:37.952
I didn't know
the GBI was here.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.867
Why'd you bring your Do Boy?

08:39.867 --> 08:42.565
Watch the tone.
We're here to check your work.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.872
"Cutting class started
when she made friends

08:44.872 --> 08:46.264
with Kayla Alexander."

08:46.264 --> 08:48.092
Oh, yeah?
Who's Kayla Alexander?

08:48.092 --> 08:50.094
Read it for yourself.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.487
Did you write that
with your feet?

08:51.487 --> 08:54.055
Read it to me.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.057
"Emma and Kayla
were inseparable.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.581
Her father
never liked Kayla."

08:58.581 --> 08:59.974
Where is the father?

08:59.974 --> 09:02.454
Should be here in a minute.

09:02.454 --> 09:05.196
He's Paul Campano,
the car guy.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.419
I thought the last name
was Bentley.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.986
Bentley's the mom's name.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.988
Paul Campano is her husband.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.904
You know, the guy who does
all those dumb commercials?

09:16.904 --> 09:18.601
He should've taken her name.

09:18.601 --> 09:22.605
Paul Bentley, the car dealer--
it was just sitting there!

09:31.048 --> 09:33.007
What's the matter?

09:33.007 --> 09:34.530
You know him?

09:34.530 --> 09:36.053
Let's go participate,
shall we?

09:36.053 --> 09:37.446
I don't have a thing to say
to that man.

09:37.446 --> 09:41.058
Hey. When you have my job,
you can hold grudges.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.886
Until then, nobody wants
to hear you bitch.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.501
Agent Trent, this is
Detective Faith Mitchell.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.373
When you were in school,
did you cut class by yourself?

09:51.373 --> 09:53.897
Isn't that something girls do
with friends?

09:53.897 --> 09:55.116
I never cut class.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.554
Wait. You think--

10:01.905 --> 10:05.213
Two pairs of shoes.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.258
I'll see if they're
the same size.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.260
What are you thinking?

10:09.260 --> 10:11.436
I don't know yet,
but something's not right.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.047
I want everybody
off my property!

10:13.047 --> 10:14.701
- Where's my wife?! Abigail!
- Sir, you cannot

10:14.701 --> 10:15.919
- come in here.
- Abigail!

10:15.919 --> 10:17.442
- This is a crime scene.
- Paul.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.096
You can't stop me
from seeing my daughter, Emma!

10:19.096 --> 10:21.055
- This is my house!
- Mr. Campano,

10:21.055 --> 10:22.665
there's an active crime scene.
We need you to wait outside.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.493
- Who are you?
- I'll take him up.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.408
It's not your case, Trent.

10:26.408 --> 10:29.106
Special Agent Will Trent,
Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.238
You're gonna need
a set of these.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.418
Follow me.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.730
Oh.

10:57.482 --> 11:01.530
Emma used to say
that I was her best friend.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.227
Straight A's.
Uh...

11:05.186 --> 11:06.535
Sh-She never would've
cut school

11:06.535 --> 11:07.579
until that girl showed up.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.451
- Who is that, Kayla?
- Yeah.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.322
Emma idolized her.

11:11.322 --> 11:14.195
They dressed alike,
navel piercings.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.457
I mean, 16 years old.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.681
You're Trashcan, right?

11:24.422 --> 11:26.250
It's been a while.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.254
We called you that because
they found you in a trash can?

11:30.254 --> 11:32.039
It was actually
a dumpster.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.562
Trashcan had a better ring,
I guess.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.267
Paul, I'm gonna need you
to ID the body.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.670
It's not her.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.065
- Are you sure?
- That's Kayla!

11:58.065 --> 12:00.197
Emma has a birthmark
on her wrist on her right arm.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.199
Abigail!
It's not Emma!

12:02.199 --> 12:03.635
- What?
- What is happening?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.768
No, no, no, the mom
told me herself.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.292
I walked in the door. She says,
"My daughter's been killed."

12:08.292 --> 12:09.772
You wouldn't let me
go upstairs!

12:09.772 --> 12:11.339
It's protocol!

12:11.339 --> 12:14.081
- Am I wrong here?
- Everybody shut up!

12:14.081 --> 12:16.648
Mom, I need you to tell me

12:16.648 --> 12:18.781
exactly what the intruder did
when you arrived home.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.522
Don't talk to my wife, Trashcan.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.610
We need to call
Emma's school.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.177
Emma's not at school, Paul.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.353
She was here with Kayla.
Tell me.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.963
He was holding a knife above

12:26.963 --> 12:27.877
who I thought was Emma. And
he-- And he came at me and--

12:27.877 --> 12:29.226
And was the knife by his side

12:29.226 --> 12:30.750
or was he threatening you
with it?

12:30.750 --> 12:31.751
Oh, God. He was coming
toward me, and he--

12:31.751 --> 12:33.404
Was the knife raised?

12:33.404 --> 12:35.406
I think he tripped and
he was trying to catch his fall,

12:35.406 --> 12:37.452
but then he pushed me
down the stairs.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.801
You were pushed
or you fell?

12:38.801 --> 12:41.108
- I don't know.
- Did he say anything?

12:41.108 --> 12:42.544
Just noises,
like he was on drugs, or--

12:42.544 --> 12:44.372
Or injured.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.556
It's a knife wound.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.601
- Deep.
- I didn't stab him.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.429
The killer-- the one who
murdered Kayla-- stabbed him.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.083
He pulled the knife out
his own collapsed lung.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.824
That's why he couldn't talk.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.695
He was drowning
in his own blood.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.133
- And then I killed him.
- Abigail, stop talking.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.439
He was innocent!
He was defending the girls!

13:08.439 --> 13:09.832
Okay, then.
Where the hell is Emma?!

13:17.231 --> 13:19.102
That's your daughter's
footprint there, Paul.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.364
It's pointed the wrong way
because your daughter

13:20.364 --> 13:23.106
was carried out the house.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.586
Put out an Amber Alert.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.109

13:41.298 --> 13:42.822

13:42.822 --> 13:45.868
GBI's stepping in,
capes and all, to save the day.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.652
I asked you if you were going
to your meetings.

13:47.652 --> 13:48.915
- Who caught it at GBI?
- Who do you think?

13:48.915 --> 13:51.178
Trent.

you're the only cop at APD

who's got
bigger fish to fry.

14:00.230 --> 14:03.668
- So answer the question.
- Oh, my God. Okay. Yes.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.235
I'm doing a meeting a day.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.716
I am making my stupid bed
in the morning.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.327
I'm extremely sober.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.329
I have perfect mental clarity
as I stay away

14:12.329 --> 14:14.679
from anything remotely fun.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.116
But are drugs really fun?

14:16.116 --> 14:18.858
Mm.
That's why people do them.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.989
Mnh. What about waking up
in strangers' beds?

14:19.989 --> 14:21.861
- Is that fun?
- Depends on the stranger.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.863
That's you.
I didn't want to come here.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.040
And because
I might die today.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.998
That's right.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.826
You wanna walk me
through it?

14:33.089 --> 14:35.918
I've been making small buys
at this fent shop in Polar Rock.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.399
Uh, but today,
I want to make a big buy.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.879
How big?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.228
200K.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.273
Apparently that's enough
to make their supplier--

14:43.273 --> 14:46.798
mysterious dude, Kodiak--
show up to fill my order.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.409
And once you get Kodiak,

14:48.409 --> 14:51.194
then the fox can leave
the henhouse

14:51.194 --> 14:52.717

lots of relief?

14:52.717 --> 14:54.937
Yeah.

14:54.937 --> 14:55.938
You know, you're really

14:57.461 --> 15:00.029
Okay, pal. I'll see you

17:23.129 --> 17:25.435
I'm not sending Faith
to A.C. Tech.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.437
- I want her to stay with you.
- That's the wrong call.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.178
We need to identify
the Adam Humphrey connection.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.137
- APD is already on it.
- No.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.313
No partners.
That was our agreement.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.879
You've never worked
an active kidnapping before.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.142

Oh, stop.
Faith isn't some grunt.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.757

- Oh, don't pretend

17:48.415 --> 17:50.156
that case didn't have an upside.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.114
Yes, you promised
I could operate on my own.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.116

I'm out.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.336

18:22.492 --> 18:25.060
Yeah. We should definitely
call the cops,

18:25.060 --> 18:26.453
'cause this place is full
of illegal drugs,

18:26.453 --> 18:27.845

looking for the wrong car.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.789
I can't tell the make.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.007
Let it play.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.447
Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

21:14.447 --> 21:16.318
Who the hell is driving
that car?

21:16.318 --> 21:18.320
There's a second kidnapper.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.154
We're in a world of hurt here.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.156
Please tell me
you've got something.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.332
Yeah. Your dead guy
in the foyer, Adam?

21:30.332 --> 21:32.029
He knew Emma.
They were friends.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.422
Friends
or more than friends?

21:33.422 --> 21:35.337
Well, the roommate
says friends.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.208
He never heard of
Kayla Alexander.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.340
Well, do you believe him?

21:38.340 --> 21:39.950
I don't believe
anybody ever.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.735
Hey, look what I just found.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.086
Whoa!

21:45.086 --> 21:48.872
Kenny just found a sizable bag
of Adderall in his room.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.005
- They're crackheads, too.
<i>- Push some more.</i>

21:51.005 --> 21:52.180
We got to figure out
this connection.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.529
I'll see what I can do.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.226
Hey.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.228
How much do you want
to punch Trent in the face?

21:57.228 --> 21:58.969
I mean,
it is a punchable face.

21:58.969 --> 22:02.103
But I'll say this though--

22:02.103 --> 22:04.758
he read that crime scene
like it was a book.

22:04.758 --> 22:08.065
<i>- Call me back, okay?</i>
- Yeah.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.806
Oh, Gabe.

22:09.806 --> 22:13.375
You know,
if I was in your shoes,

22:13.375 --> 22:14.724
I'd want to make sure
whoever killed my friend

22:14.724 --> 22:15.812
paid a price for it.

22:15.812 --> 22:18.162
Hey!
Take your hands off him!

22:18.162 --> 22:19.773
- I'm not talking to you.
- It's on camera!

22:19.773 --> 22:21.209
- I want to call my parents.
- Hey, take it easy, Ormewood.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.863
There's a girl out there
missing!

22:22.863 --> 22:25.126
Come on, folks! Back up.
Give us-- Give us space!

22:25.126 --> 22:26.432
- We need--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.261
Ken? Kenny!

22:31.262 --> 22:32.351
Too many doughnuts!

22:32.351 --> 22:35.005
Kenny?
Call am ambulance!

22:37.791 --> 22:39.488
You run this place
all by yourself?

22:39.488 --> 22:43.318
The guy who owns it moved
to Omaha. He's never around.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.102
They're techs with the band
that's coming in tomorrow.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.408
You work with them before?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.453
First time.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.019
I'm gonna need that tape.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.369
Yeah.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.418
You've got an interesting way
of organizing your world here.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.986
Brain's a little weird.

22:58.986 --> 23:02.468
Music I get.
Words, not so much.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.470
Good for you, man.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.341
All right, I'll be in touch
if I need anything else.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.387
Cool.
Uh, hope you find her.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.174
Amanda's breathing down
my neck

23:13.174 --> 23:15.263
because Paul Campano
needs an update.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.396
All right, have him meet us
at the GBI.

23:19.223 --> 23:22.052
He's not coming.
Too many cops.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.577
Okay. So, when are we
rescheduling this?

23:24.577 --> 23:26.274
I'll hit you up
on WhatsApp.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.929
Wait for APD to leave
before you bounce.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.452
Jules.
Come by my place later?

23:30.452 --> 23:31.845
Hang for a little?

23:31.845 --> 23:33.455
I've got my kid tonight.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.892
Find somebody to watch him.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.285
Don't leave me hanging.

23:42.899 --> 23:45.032
Hey.

23:45.032 --> 23:45.902
Why'd he do that
to your face?

23:48.992 --> 23:50.298
He was taking money.

23:50.298 --> 23:53.344
I-- I walked in on him.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.522
You may be in more trouble
than you think.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.089
This is a scary guy.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.004
Seriously, do you have
any money saved up?

24:01.004 --> 24:02.136
No.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.094
He wants me to come
over tonight.

24:04.094 --> 24:07.358
What am I gonna do?

24:07.358 --> 24:08.882
You're sure he's skimming?

24:08.882 --> 24:09.926
Money and product.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.841
He-- He took it
again today.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.538
Hey.

24:56.538 --> 25:00.063
Hello?

25:00.063 --> 25:02.109
You were talking to Warren
for a while in there.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.894
Did you see something?
Please don't touch that!

25:04.894 --> 25:07.201
He's dyslexic.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.550
I assume your car's
out of warranty?

25:08.550 --> 25:10.465
How do you know that?

25:10.465 --> 25:12.206
'Cause the glove compartment's
held up by duct tape.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.295
I was talking about
the dyslexia.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.297
Color coded file system,

25:16.297 --> 25:17.472
color coded buttons
on all the consoles.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.082
It's a workaround
for dyslexia.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.258
It's our job
to notice things.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.956
You intend to pay any of
these parking tickets?

25:22.956 --> 25:25.306
Just--

25:25.306 --> 25:28.048
Can you please
stay out of my business?

25:28.048 --> 25:29.484
The duct tape
is working just fine.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.486
I have a system.
Everything is under control.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.183
I have to get this.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.055
What's going on?
I'm working.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.013
<i>Mom, don't be mad
but my computer fell out</i>

25:37.013 --> 25:38.232
<i>the balcony of my dorm.</i>

25:38.232 --> 25:41.235
What? How?
I am really interested to know

25:41.235 --> 25:45.195
how your computer fell off of
a third-story balcony, Jeremy.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.719
<i>The details are not
gonna make you feel any better.</i>

25:46.719 --> 25:48.242
<i>All my files are on it,
and it won't turn on.</i>

25:48.242 --> 25:51.288
I told you to keep everything
backed up!

25:51.288 --> 25:52.507
You're in college now.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.074
He can bring it
to the GBI lab.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.597
They can recover
his hard drive.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.207
<i>The GBI can fix
my computer? Awesome!</i>

25:57.207 --> 25:59.296
The Georgia Bureau
of Investigation

25:59.296 --> 26:01.385
is not fixing
your computer.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.996
Live with the consequences.
I gotta go.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.432
Love you. Bye.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.652
- What's with the chiming in?
- Just trying to help.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.218
Who asked for your help?

26:08.218 --> 26:10.394
Hmm. Fixed it.

26:10.394 --> 26:11.961
I can't believe you have
a college-aged son.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.615
- How old are you?
- How old is your mom?

26:13.615 --> 26:14.964
Let's be clear--

26:14.964 --> 26:16.618
neither of us is thrilled
about this arrangement,

26:16.618 --> 26:18.707
so let's just be polite
and get through this case.

26:18.707 --> 26:19.969
-"Polite"?
- Yes.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.972
The opposite
of openly hostile.

26:22.972 --> 26:23.712
What's my name, Trent?

26:23.712 --> 26:26.410
You missed it, huh?

26:26.410 --> 26:28.587
Wasn't relevant to the case?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.458
It's Faith.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.982
Mitchell.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.725
- I investigated your mother.
- No.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.118
You ended her thirty-year,
highly decorated

26:38.118 --> 26:39.336
law enforcement career.

26:41.295 --> 26:44.690
Can you fix that?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.430
Not likely.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.573
Maybe I should handle Paul.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.879
I have a good read on Paul

26:59.879 --> 27:01.097
from this morning...

27:01.097 --> 27:03.665
...but if I need you,
I'll let you know.

27:03.665 --> 27:07.147
Great, I'll just take coffee
orders and make a Starbucks run.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.105
- Wait.
- Where you been?

27:09.105 --> 27:10.933
Hold the elevator!

27:14.110 --> 27:15.677
Agent Trent.

27:23.554 --> 27:24.991
Kenny's in the hospital.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.601
- What?
- Oh, no. What happened?

27:26.601 --> 27:28.037
Stroke.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.561
While doing
the GBI's scutwork.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.265
I'm going up to five
with Special Agent Trent.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.701
Ooh. GBI.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.972
No.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.279
Whoa. What's happening?

27:52.279 --> 27:53.976
What's the question
behind the question?

27:53.976 --> 27:55.238
What?

27:55.238 --> 27:56.849
Why'd you ask me
if you should handle Paul?

27:56.849 --> 27:59.112
Well, because you
alienate people

27:59.112 --> 28:00.896
with your three-piece suit
and your little handkerchief

28:00.896 --> 28:03.116
and your terrible personality.

28:03.116 --> 28:06.119
Also, something isn't right
with the Campanos.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.903
I tried to talk to Abigail
this morning,

28:07.903 --> 28:09.818
and he did not like it.

28:09.818 --> 28:10.993
He's afraid of what
she'll say.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.703
All right.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.704
All right?

28:27.706 --> 28:29.838
Let's throw a grenade.
See what happens.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.013
Grenade?
What does that mean?

28:31.013 --> 28:32.580
So now I've got to come
to your office

28:32.580 --> 28:34.103
to get news
about my daughter?

28:34.103 --> 28:35.452
What are we doing here?

28:35.452 --> 28:36.845
You should be out there
turning over every stone,

28:36.845 --> 28:38.020
looking for Emma.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.935
I'm gonna need a DNA sample
from you.

28:39.935 --> 28:42.242
Why's that, Trash?

28:42.242 --> 28:45.680
Kayla Alexander had consensual
intercourse this morning.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.812
I need to rule you out.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.205
Paul!

28:55.690 --> 28:57.083
Get off me, Trashcan!

28:58.911 --> 29:00.782
Do you know each other?

29:00.782 --> 29:04.873
Paul and I grew up together in
the children's home, didn't we?

29:04.873 --> 29:05.918
You lived in an orphanage?

29:05.918 --> 29:06.962
I-I didn't know
how to tell you.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.659
Your wife?
Oh, my God!

29:08.659 --> 29:10.096
It was a hundred years ago.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.619
- You're a sociopath.
- We're gonna find Emma,

29:11.619 --> 29:13.055
and we're gonna go back
to the way things used to be.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.188
Someone is out there
doing terrible things to Emma.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.364
Nothing is ever gonna go back
to the way it used to be!

29:18.844 --> 29:20.019
This morning,
I threatened a woman

29:20.019 --> 29:21.977
who my husband
is having an affair with.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.109
- Abigail, stop.
- Her name is Dylan Calloway.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.067
- Abigail, stop!
- You should get that

29:25.067 --> 29:26.765
DNA sample
because my husband has a type.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.636
- Stop it.
- She's a trainer.

29:28.636 --> 29:29.985
She's 22,
but she looks 16.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.247
Here, look at her Instagram.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.989
She looks exactly
like Kayla Alexander.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.295
I'm going to my parents' house.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.818
Don't you dare call me!

29:41.388 --> 29:45.000
All right, so, maybe your guys
cleaned out your shop,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.829
but we still have the drugs and
the cash we found in your trunk.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.092
Illegal pretext stop.
Won't hold up.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.833
My lawyer's an animal.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.053
Let's talk about Jules.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.706
What about her?

29:55.706 --> 29:58.144
You ever tell her about
any illegal activities?

29:58.144 --> 30:00.059
You ever do anything illegal
in front of her?

30:00.059 --> 30:02.452
You ever show her
where your supply is?

30:02.452 --> 30:05.760
You're thinking she'll never
say anything

30:05.760 --> 30:07.414
because she is too scared.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.546
You smacked her around enough.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.723
Yeah, she'll stay in line, right?

30:12.723 --> 30:15.596
But wait a sec.

30:15.596 --> 30:19.992
Kyle, how did I know
what's in the trunk of your car?

30:24.648 --> 30:26.825
Use it while you're working
the Campano case.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.654
And after that?

30:30.654 --> 30:32.439
Find the girl.
We'll go from there.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.182
You need anything else?

30:36.182 --> 30:38.837
Yeah, actually.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.447
You can tell me
why you're doing this to me.

30:40.447 --> 30:41.665
Doing this to you?

30:41.665 --> 30:43.145
Putting you with
my best agent?

30:43.145 --> 30:45.800
Handcuffing me to this
strange man who won't tell me

30:45.800 --> 30:47.106
a damn thing
about my own case.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.760
Make it work,
you ungrateful jackass.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.893
Wow.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.590
I've known you
your entire life.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.897
I have high expectations
for you.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.116
Jeremy's grown now.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.813
What's your next move?

30:58.813 --> 31:00.946
Will can take you
to the next level.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.861
He can teach you
to be surgical,

31:02.861 --> 31:04.514
to see things
that no one else does.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.389
You can thank me
when you're ready.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.132
Yes, ma'am.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.744
This guy is not nothing.

31:16.744 --> 31:20.530
I know you understand
what a disaster this is.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.837
I know you understand what kind
of a day this was, Captain.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.230
A rich white girl
goes missing,

31:24.230 --> 31:26.710
the GBI chases her
right to my doorstep,

31:26.710 --> 31:27.755
so I pulled the trigger.

31:27.755 --> 31:30.497
He's gonna flip.

31:30.497 --> 31:31.585
Well, you're free now.

31:33.021 --> 31:36.198
You and Ormewood
ever work together?

31:36.198 --> 31:38.026
Uh, yeah,
a couple years ago.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.549
- Once.
- Good.

31:39.549 --> 31:42.030
Kenny's in bad shape.

31:42.030 --> 31:45.729
I mean, he's gonna pull through,
but he's not coming back.

31:45.729 --> 31:48.123
I don't work homicide anymore.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.086
What do you think, Franklin?

31:54.086 --> 31:55.609
Oh, I think this is none
of my business.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.959
Oh, come on.
Should Detective Polaski

31:57.959 --> 31:59.918
stay in vice,
with all her vices?

32:03.138 --> 32:05.097
Well, maybe a change of scene
would be good.

32:05.097 --> 32:07.838
See? I need
someone to keep an eye on you,

32:07.838 --> 32:08.839
and no one's tougher
than Ormewood.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.538
I'll set it up.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.931
<i>Unit 324...</i>

32:16.673 --> 32:18.153
<i>What I know about
Paul Campano</i>

32:18.153 --> 32:19.807
<i>is that he's a bully.</i>

32:19.807 --> 32:21.243
<i>I wasn't the only kid
at the group home</i>

32:21.243 --> 32:23.158
<i>he beat the crap out of,</i>

32:23.158 --> 32:24.986
<i>but I might have been
his favorite.</i>

32:24.986 --> 32:28.163
<i>Looking back,
it's hard to be angry.</i>

32:29.904 --> 32:32.298
<i>There were rumors that Paul
was sexually abused</i>

32:32.298 --> 32:33.864
<i>by a foster parent.</i>

32:35.866 --> 32:37.259
Was that the one part
of our childhood

32:37.259 --> 32:38.869
he wasn't able to outrun?

32:44.658 --> 32:47.704
Trent.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.272
Really? On my way.

32:50.272 --> 32:53.014
And that other cop,
he was such a dick!

32:53.014 --> 32:54.973
It's like he just wanted
to throw me in jail.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.670
Yeah, look,
I hate cops like that, too.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.977
You're under no suspicion here.
You're a witness.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.892
Why don't you just say
what you came here to say?

33:01.892 --> 33:06.027
Adam-- Adam made me
promise to keep it quiet.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.942
She was in high school,
and they were sleeping together.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.465
He-- He didn't want
to get in trouble.

33:09.465 --> 33:12.120
The only thing that matters
right now is finding Emma.

33:13.817 --> 33:15.080
Some guy
was threatening Adam,

33:15.080 --> 33:16.211
telling him to stay away
from Emma.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.956
We didn't know who it was,
but he'd leave notes on his car

33:21.956 --> 33:23.131
and under our door
when we woke up.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.177
Did you save the notes?

33:25.177 --> 33:28.832
Yeah.
This is the last one I got.

33:28.832 --> 33:31.661
"I will wreck your entire life,
freak pedo scum."

33:31.661 --> 33:33.315
Look how creepy it is.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.972
All the Es and Ks
are backwards.

33:37.972 --> 33:42.672
The kid at the recording studio,
are you sure he's dyslexic?

33:42.672 --> 33:45.153
Positive. Put a location trace
on his cell,

33:45.153 --> 33:46.676
and send APD units
to every address

33:46.676 --> 33:48.113
we have for Warren Grier.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.157
Got it.

33:53.292 --> 33:58.732
<i>♪ It'll shake us all,
so stay here♪</i>

33:58.732 --> 34:00.386
Warren!

34:01.517 --> 34:02.518
<i>♪ This goes way beyond♪</i>

34:02.518 --> 34:03.563
There's gotta be a key somewhere.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.099
<i>Warren, can you hear me?</i>

34:18.099 --> 34:19.666
Why don't you come out here
so we can talk?

34:25.498 --> 34:26.629
<i>How many of these you take?</i>

34:26.629 --> 34:28.240
<i>Is that a joke?</i>

34:28.240 --> 34:30.590
<i>I took all of it.</i>

34:30.590 --> 34:32.418
I just want this day
to be over!

34:32.418 --> 34:34.637
I'll call medical.
Keep him talking.

34:34.637 --> 34:37.118
- God.
<i>- You're right.</i>

34:37.118 --> 34:38.467
It wasn't a good day.

34:38.467 --> 34:39.686
Tell me about it.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.867
All I cared about
was Emma, man.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.306
<i>Warren,
if you care about Emma,</i>

34:51.306 --> 34:53.178
how about I go check
on her, huh?

34:53.178 --> 34:55.136
<i>Is she with your partner?</i>

34:55.136 --> 34:56.659
This is
Detective Faith Mitchell,

34:56.659 --> 34:59.314
requesting an ambulance
to Boughery Studios.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.664
<i>Tell me where they are.
It'll save time.</i>

35:01.664 --> 35:04.319
It'll be a good thing
for Emma.

35:04.319 --> 35:06.321
<i>You're not gonna find him!</i>

35:06.321 --> 35:09.194
Well, we found you.

35:09.194 --> 35:10.586
Talk to me.

35:10.586 --> 35:11.718
<i>Where are they?</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:15.591
Warren, I need you
to focus on Emma.

35:15.591 --> 35:18.420
Hey! Warren!

35:18.420 --> 35:21.206
Ahh! I didn't mean
to kill anybody, man!

35:21.206 --> 35:22.685
<i>Listen to me.
We don't have to worry</i>

35:22.685 --> 35:24.426
<i>about anything else
that happened today.</i>

35:24.426 --> 35:26.167
<i>Let's just bring Emma home.</i>

35:26.167 --> 35:28.648
I don't know where she is!

35:28.648 --> 35:29.823
Then tell me
who your partner is.

35:29.823 --> 35:32.652
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

35:32.652 --> 35:35.524
- You have to, Warren.
<i>- He told me...</i>

35:38.614 --> 35:40.442
<i>He told me I need
to kill myself.</i>

35:40.442 --> 35:43.315
No.
That's a mistake.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.578
I don't know who this guy is
or what he's done for you,

35:45.578 --> 35:47.797
but that's not something
that he gets to decide.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.150
I'm on my own now.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.194
<i>No, you're not.</i>

35:53.194 --> 35:54.152
<i>Look, man, I'm here.</i>

35:54.152 --> 35:55.327
<i>Look at me.</i>

35:55.327 --> 35:57.677
I'm listening.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.069
I can help you, Warren.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.552
<i>I know what you're feeling,
all right?</i>

36:03.552 --> 36:05.598
You're gonna find a way
through this.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.777
Why would I want to?

36:10.777 --> 36:12.779
For Emma.

36:19.612 --> 36:21.570
<i>Warren!
Warren, put the gun down.</i>

36:21.570 --> 36:23.224
<i>Put down the gun.</i>
Get in there!

36:23.224 --> 36:24.312
Warren, put down the gun!

36:24.312 --> 36:26.227
Warren, no! No!

36:26.227 --> 36:27.185
Warren, no!

36:38.239 --> 36:39.719
You okay?

36:41.460 --> 36:43.418
I see the hanky
came in handy.

36:47.944 --> 36:51.905
Point of the group home was
for us to find a forever home.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.863
Families would take us in,
but a surprising number of them

36:53.863 --> 36:56.562
were monsters.

36:56.562 --> 37:00.783
The old woman who ran the group,
Mrs. Flannery,

37:00.783 --> 37:03.656
she tried her best.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.571
Yeah, she made sure we knew
how to do our laundry,

37:05.571 --> 37:08.443
iron our shirts, knew what
a fish fork was in case

37:08.443 --> 37:12.621
we ever had dinner
at the White House.

37:12.621 --> 37:15.929
She made sure we all carried
a handkerchief.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.192
Old habit.

37:22.979 --> 37:26.722
Thank you
for telling me that.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.511
Hey, Amanda's looking for me
to pull my weight around here.

37:32.511 --> 37:36.384
So it would be good
if you let me.

37:36.384 --> 37:39.300
I mean, it's not like Leo's
taking me back after this.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.869
Not with your stink
all on me.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.479
Not with the stink, no.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.705
You need a ride home?

38:00.452 --> 38:02.715
I hear your guy flipped.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.760
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.762
I also hear we're back
to working together.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.460
Guess so.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.462
You know, I don't think
either of us was happy

38:10.462 --> 38:11.985
with how it ended last time.

38:11.985 --> 38:15.771
Maybe we can, uh,
do better, huh?

38:15.771 --> 38:17.251
Go home to your wife, Ormewood.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.833
That's right.
I have a dog.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.793
Look at you, you haven't even
touched your food.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.621
You can't tell me
you're not hungry.

38:39.621 --> 38:40.970
What if I give you
some of that?

38:42.494 --> 38:47.368
Oh. Okay.
All right. I got you.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.588
Come on. I'll take you out
in just a minute.

38:58.031 --> 38:59.598
You still have a key?

39:01.556 --> 39:03.558
What, you want it back?

39:03.558 --> 39:06.648
No, it's just been a while
since you dropped by.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.651
You want to talk
about that?

39:10.870 --> 39:13.742
Nope.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.483
No, I don't.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.572
That dog is ridiculous.

39:17.572 --> 39:19.705
Rescue.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.533
I tried to take her
to a shelter but...

39:21.533 --> 39:25.363
Couldn't do it.

39:29.410 --> 39:32.631
Let's talk
about Paul Campano.

39:32.631 --> 39:35.460
Our one lead
just shot himself.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.462
I'm not asking
about the case.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.464
There's not much else
to say.

39:39.464 --> 39:40.726
He still calls me Trashcan.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.599
You want me
to kick his ass again?

39:44.599 --> 39:46.558
Actually, I already took care
of that today.

39:46.558 --> 39:47.907
- Oh, yeah?
- Nice little fight

39:47.907 --> 39:49.604
in the middle of the GBI.

39:49.604 --> 39:51.389
Oh. You win?

39:52.477 --> 39:53.608
Of course I won.

39:58.831 --> 40:01.137
You're not the only one
who picked up a stray today.

40:01.137 --> 40:03.313
Heller put me on Homicide.

40:04.184 --> 40:07.970
Ormewood is my partner now.

40:07.970 --> 40:08.971
Mm.

40:08.971 --> 40:11.626
That sucks.

40:15.761 --> 40:18.285
I don't remember much about the
last time you worked with him.

40:18.285 --> 40:21.288
What are you trying
to tell me?

42:53.266 --> 42:55.268
Somehow, I missed that he was
one of our kidnappers.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.314
Then he shot himself.

43:13.765 --> 43:17.682
"My mother's favorite
movie is 'Steel Magnolias.'

43:17.682 --> 43:20.772
I remember coming home to her
crying at the scene

43:20.772 --> 43:25.515
where Sally Fields breaks down
at her daughter's funeral.

43:25.515 --> 43:28.649
This prompted hugs
and long conversation."

43:28.649 --> 43:30.259
I gotta find this kid.

43:35.830 --> 43:37.179
What is it, Betty?

43:45.840 --> 43:48.843
- Who is it?!
- Trash!

43:48.843 --> 43:50.802
I really messed up.
I need your help.

43:50.802 --> 43:52.412
What happened?

43:52.412 --> 43:53.674
I shot him.

43:53.674 --> 43:55.241
Who?

43:55.241 --> 43:56.938
The man that took Emma.
