01:35.011 --> 01:36.638
Hello.

01:36.813 --> 01:39.008
<i>When I think about that time...<i></i></i>

01:39.182 --> 01:43.016
<i>...it's not the heat,
the dust, the nuns...<i></i></i>

01:43.653 --> 01:46.053
<i>...or even the boys I remember...<i></i></i>

01:46.222 --> 01:49.487
<i>...so much as a sense of anticipation.<i></i></i>

01:50.827 --> 01:55.526
<i>The constant belief
that somehow I'd be saved.<i></i></i>

02:23.693 --> 02:26.594
<i>I wouldn't say we had it bad...<i></i></i>

02:26.930 --> 02:30.058
<i>...since it was all most of us knew.<i></i></i>

02:30.934 --> 02:33.926
<i>It was only there was something
just out of reach...<i></i></i>

02:34.103 --> 02:36.196
<i>...and we might never catch up.<i></i></i>

03:02.966 --> 03:05.628
Lights out, boys.

03:10.807 --> 03:14.573
May you be blessed
and sleep with God's benevolent grace.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.245
Amen.

03:32.929 --> 03:34.988
Sparks.

04:04.861 --> 04:07.056
Someone's coming.

04:45.001 --> 04:49.267
<i>I don't remember who wrote
"I love a sunburnt country"...<i></i></i>

04:49.706 --> 04:52.539
<i>...but I'd bet money
they never lived out here.<i></i></i>

04:53.743 --> 04:58.544
<i>Just look at it.
It's the definition of desolate.<i></i></i>

04:58.748 --> 05:02.184
<i>This is where I lived
most of my young years.<i></i></i>

05:02.385 --> 05:05.081
<i>This is where I lived until,
you could say...<i></i></i>

05:05.254 --> 05:07.279
<i>...I was rescued by a dream.<i></i></i>

05:18.034 --> 05:19.763
<i>These were my best friends.<i></i></i>

05:19.936 --> 05:24.464
<i>Spark, Spit and Maps.<i></i></i>

05:24.640 --> 05:28.940
<i>My real name's Vernon,
but they call me Misty.<i></i></i>

05:29.145 --> 05:31.443
<i>No reason to go into that right now.<i></i></i>

05:32.949 --> 05:35.918
Today's the first of December...

05:36.119 --> 05:39.611
...the December boys
please come forward.

05:40.456 --> 05:43.584
<i>They say the best place to start
is the beginning.<i></i></i>

05:43.760 --> 05:47.662
<i>So, first off, you better know
we were all orphans.<i></i></i>

05:50.033 --> 05:52.263
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Sister.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.596
Thanks, Sister.

05:57.340 --> 05:58.398
Thank you.

05:58.574 --> 06:00.132
Everybody ready?

06:12.055 --> 06:13.784
It's about the smokes.

06:13.990 --> 06:16.151
I told you
she looks under the mattress.

06:16.325 --> 06:20.091
- I didn't put them there.
- It's about mooning Willie.

06:35.845 --> 06:37.813
Enter.

06:46.456 --> 06:48.720
Come in, boys.

06:52.895 --> 06:54.556
Father Scully...

06:54.730 --> 06:58.996
...this is James, Donald,
Bruce and Vernon.

06:59.168 --> 07:04.003
Better known as Maps,
Spark, Spit and Misty.

07:04.373 --> 07:06.102
They're our December boys.

07:08.044 --> 07:11.138
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, Father.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.544
We have a little surprise for you.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.884
Oh, it's a pleasant surprise.

07:18.054 --> 07:21.080
A benefactor has left
St. Gregory's a little money...

07:21.257 --> 07:25.250
...and I've decided to send everyone
on a holiday.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.993
As this is your birthday month...

07:28.164 --> 07:30.598
...I felt it fitting
you should be the first to go.

07:30.766 --> 07:32.063
We're going on a holiday?

07:32.235 --> 07:35.534
You'll be staying
with Mr. And Mrs. McAnsh.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.366
They're great friends
of the Church.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.769
It's a town called...

07:40.009 --> 07:43.206
...Lady Star Cove.

07:43.946 --> 07:45.436
It's a special place...

07:46.782 --> 07:49.250
...on the sea.

07:51.921 --> 07:54.355
On the sea?

07:58.060 --> 08:00.119
Yes.

08:00.296 --> 08:05.757
It could be
that Our Lady interceded for you.

08:08.037 --> 08:11.564
<i>I had this spiritual antenna
other people didn't have.<i></i></i>

08:13.075 --> 08:16.533
<i>That's why I could see things
no one else could.<i></i></i>

08:16.746 --> 08:19.613
<i>When I looked at Our Lady, I knew.<i></i></i>

08:19.815 --> 08:24.718
<i>I knew she'd chosen me
for a special mission.<i></i></i>

09:08.731 --> 09:10.926
Maps.

09:30.052 --> 09:34.512
<i>It was more than being orphans
that tied us together.<i></i></i>

09:34.690 --> 09:37.454
<i>Or even our friendship.<i></i></i>

09:38.194 --> 09:40.458
<i>It was like destiny.<i></i></i>

09:40.663 --> 09:42.255
Cross swords.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.698
<i>We were even given
the same birth month.<i></i></i>

09:45.868 --> 09:51.204
All for one, and one for all.
December boys.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.575
<i>The further we traveled
from what we knew...<i></i></i>

10:02.785 --> 10:07.586
<i>...the more it seemed like we were
being pulled into another world...<i></i></i>

10:07.790 --> 10:10.486
<i>...a world where all the doors
were open...<i></i></i>

10:10.693 --> 10:14.060
<i>...and anything was possible.<i></i></i>

10:35.718 --> 10:38.346
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...<i></i></i>

10:44.226 --> 10:48.560
<i>The most bone-rattling,
jaw-clenching...<i></i></i>

10:48.731 --> 10:51.962
<i>...death-defying act
you've ever seen!<i></i></i>

10:52.134 --> 10:57.333
<i>The Wall of Death!<i></i></i>

11:00.876 --> 11:05.108
<i>The one, the only,
the bravest man on two wheels...<i></i></i>

11:05.348 --> 11:06.975
<i>...Fearless Forte!<i></i></i>

11:42.785 --> 11:45.413
- You all right there, boys?
- Yes, Father.

11:45.588 --> 11:48.318
- Come along.
- Come on, fellows.

11:48.591 --> 11:51.151
Right you are.
Welcome aboard.

11:51.327 --> 11:54.319
Boys, this is Petty Officer
Bandy McAnsh.

11:54.497 --> 11:56.624
Father.

11:56.832 --> 11:59.130
Petty officer.

12:01.103 --> 12:05.005
As you can see,
all present and accounted for.

12:05.174 --> 12:07.699
Boys, I'd like you
to meet my lovely wife...

12:07.877 --> 12:11.335
...and the skipper
of this establishment, Mrs. McAnsh.

12:11.514 --> 12:12.606
Nice to meet you.

12:12.782 --> 12:16.718
Father, we thank God
for your safe arrival.

12:16.952 --> 12:19.182
May his grace light your paths...

12:19.855 --> 12:24.883
...and give you the appropriate wisdom
and joy from your new experience.

12:25.060 --> 12:27.051
- Amen.
- I knew there'd be a catch.

12:27.229 --> 12:30.027
Petty officer, show the new recruits
to their quarters...

12:30.199 --> 12:32.861
...and I'll finish in the galley.

12:33.202 --> 12:35.500
Well, have fun, boys.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.797
Thank you, Father.

12:36.972 --> 12:38.030
Right.

12:38.207 --> 12:40.072
Step this way.

12:40.242 --> 12:42.802
Welcome aboard.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.904
All right, mateys.

13:11.407 --> 13:13.705
It's been a long day.

13:13.909 --> 13:17.242
Time to settle down.
Everyone in bed.

13:18.914 --> 13:24.352
And we'll let the Old Specific
sing you a lullaby.

13:27.022 --> 13:28.683
Good night, boys.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.235
The ocean's loud.

13:44.540 --> 13:48.032
- I didn't think it'd be this loud.
- Yeah.

13:48.210 --> 13:49.802
The Old Specific.

13:49.979 --> 13:53.107
Hey, Spit, have a look at this.

14:01.790 --> 14:03.815
Hey, what's that?

14:03.993 --> 14:06.621
I suppose you know
you'll be going to hell?

14:06.962 --> 14:08.930
Really?

14:10.332 --> 14:11.560
Now I'll have company.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.795
Knock it off, both of you.

14:16.972 --> 14:19.304
I'm trying to relax.

14:21.977 --> 14:23.842
You hear that?

14:24.580 --> 14:26.844
Is he coming?

14:29.285 --> 14:31.446
Listen.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.688
My ass is snoring.

15:04.186 --> 15:06.586
Come on, mate.

15:34.717 --> 15:37.117
Last one in's a rotten egg!

15:37.319 --> 15:40.049
Really? Looks like
you're the rotten egg, Spit.

15:40.222 --> 15:42.520
Come on, Mist.

15:45.327 --> 15:46.351
Come on, Misty.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.223
- Come on.
- Come in.

15:53.402 --> 15:55.336
Have a look at this.

15:55.504 --> 15:56.732
Spark, come on.

15:56.905 --> 15:59.066
Yeah, coming.

16:01.910 --> 16:04.105
Hey!

16:04.279 --> 16:05.507
Hey!

16:05.681 --> 16:07.342
- Hey, fishing boat.
- Hello?

16:08.283 --> 16:09.580
- Hey.
- Over here.

16:09.752 --> 16:10.878
Hey, over here.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.146
Look.

16:15.658 --> 16:19.458
Come on.
Race you to the rocks.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.347
Hey, fellows.

17:26.862 --> 17:29.729
Somebody's set themselves up.

17:35.337 --> 17:37.931
Check out the cordial.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.700
- Maps.
- They're somebody else's.

17:41.877 --> 17:44.004
Don't take any.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.364
Hey.

18:05.534 --> 18:07.195
Who wants a ride?

18:46.575 --> 18:49.066
Coming back down.

18:55.818 --> 18:57.080
Hey, guys.

18:57.252 --> 18:59.277
What is it?

19:00.088 --> 19:01.953
Find out.

19:37.893 --> 19:40.919
<i>She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen...<i></i></i>

19:41.129 --> 19:42.960
<i>...other than Our Lady.<i></i></i>

19:43.165 --> 19:45.861
<i>Sleek as a seal.<i></i></i>

19:46.068 --> 19:50.300
<i>Mind you, I hadn't seen
nearly as much of Our Lady.<i></i></i>

19:51.974 --> 19:55.603
Sparks. Come on. Sparks, get up.

19:56.011 --> 19:58.673
Come on. Get up.

20:06.488 --> 20:09.389
We heard you were coming.

20:15.530 --> 20:17.964
I'm Teresa.

20:19.401 --> 20:23.303
<i>This was as close as I'd come
to a religious epiphany.<i></i></i>

20:23.505 --> 20:26.599
<i>But whatever ideas I had
about becoming a priest...<i></i></i>

20:26.775 --> 20:28.606
<i>...quickly climbed into the back seat.<i></i></i>

20:30.946 --> 20:32.880
How did you get these names?

20:33.048 --> 20:36.017
We call him Spark
because he stuck a knife in a toaster...

20:36.184 --> 20:39.210
...and nearly set the orphanage
on fire.

20:43.058 --> 20:45.219
And you? You are Spit?

20:49.131 --> 20:53.124
My dad flew a Spitfire during the war.
And I'm a champion spitter.

20:53.735 --> 20:56.226
- And you, you like maps.
- No.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.133
He's got a birthmark on his chest
shaped like Tasmania.

20:59.308 --> 21:01.572
I'm all right.

21:04.179 --> 21:08.479
If he doesn't want any,
I'll have seconds.

21:15.824 --> 21:17.724
And why are you Misty?

21:17.893 --> 21:19.417
Because he's a waterworks.

21:22.397 --> 21:25.696
Okay. I'm going now.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.859
Fearless is home tonight.

21:41.616 --> 21:42.913
Who's that?

21:43.085 --> 21:47.044
That's Shellback.
He fishes for Henry.

21:47.689 --> 21:51.125
Is Henry a person or a fish?

22:35.837 --> 22:38.271
<i>O, my good angel...<i></i></i>

22:39.107 --> 22:42.474
...whom God has appointed
my guardian...

22:42.644 --> 22:45.238
...watch over me during this night...

22:45.414 --> 22:46.847
...and protect me...

22:47.582 --> 22:50.745
...from evil in my thoughts
as well as my deeds.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.117
In the deepest hour of darkness...

22:56.324 --> 22:59.259
...let your presence lead the way...

22:59.461 --> 23:02.123
<i>...to righteousness...<i></i></i>

23:02.330 --> 23:04.696
<i>...and goodness.<i></i></i>

23:14.443 --> 23:16.138
Boys.

23:16.344 --> 23:20.075
God cares nothing for motorcycles.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.168
Henry.

23:45.474 --> 23:50.036
- You're gonna get us in trouble.
- I know how to ride one of these.

23:50.412 --> 23:52.471
My dad had one, only bigger.

23:52.647 --> 23:55.013
Bullshit, your dad died
when you was 3.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.480
Get down.

23:57.819 --> 24:00.083
Somebody say
you could climb up there?

24:00.255 --> 24:03.418
We was just looking.

24:04.126 --> 24:06.185
That what you call it?

24:06.561 --> 24:08.586
We're here on holiday.

24:08.763 --> 24:11.994
My dad had a bike just like this.

24:12.167 --> 24:13.429
That so?

24:13.635 --> 24:16.365
I saw you on the Wall of Death.

24:16.938 --> 24:19.338
I saw you go through the fire
and everything.

24:19.508 --> 24:21.942
You must be about
the best cyclist there is.

24:27.749 --> 24:29.876
- You boys like a thrill, do you?
- Yeah.

24:31.853 --> 24:33.548
Who's first?

24:36.691 --> 24:38.716
I've been on a bike before.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.589
I'll go.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.665
Faster. Faster.

25:46.828 --> 25:47.852
Yes!

26:41.283 --> 26:44.514
At least someone's
having a good time.

27:07.075 --> 27:08.099
How you going?

27:10.745 --> 27:12.906
Good night.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.679
See you later.

27:21.022 --> 27:22.080
"How you going?"

27:22.257 --> 27:25.522
You'll be up her
like a rat up a drainpipe.

27:27.128 --> 27:29.358
Come on, give us a go.

27:29.964 --> 27:31.522
Why do we have to be stuck here?

27:31.700 --> 27:34.931
- That's easy.
- No, it's not.

27:35.570 --> 27:38.095
I'm not stuck.

27:47.649 --> 27:49.617
Go.

27:49.851 --> 27:51.648
Go.

27:55.657 --> 27:58.217
The least you can do
is three cheers for the corpse.

27:58.393 --> 28:00.224
Hip, hip, hurray!

28:00.395 --> 28:01.885
Boys.

28:02.063 --> 28:03.087
Thanks, Luce.

28:03.264 --> 28:04.754
- Yeah, thanks.
- Thank you, Lucy.

28:04.933 --> 28:08.266
That is the same sort of thing
that happened to Archbishop O'Donnell.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.461
I was there in the church
Sunday morning...

28:10.638 --> 28:12.902
...come to the end of the sermon,
and he says:

28:13.074 --> 28:17.272
"Therefore, many are cold
but few are frozen."

28:17.445 --> 28:20.073
And it was the middle of winter.

28:21.082 --> 28:23.414
You know, it's good
with Lucy around this summer.

28:23.585 --> 28:28.284
- Give Tess some girl company.
- By the way, how's her father doing?

28:28.490 --> 28:31.584
Still looking for work in Darwin.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.090
Five minutes to dinner.

28:33.628 --> 28:36.324
- Thanks, darling.
- Cheers, Teresa.

28:37.031 --> 28:40.159
Hey, he just swiped your beer.

28:41.936 --> 28:43.961
Let them have their fun.

28:44.672 --> 28:46.640
Wait for me. Wait.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.038
I don't expect it's a picnic
where they're from.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.177
For all you hear,
it's not too bad out there.

28:52.347 --> 28:54.440
They're well cared for.

28:54.616 --> 28:56.846
Yeah, I'll bet they are.

28:57.051 --> 29:00.487
I think I'll go and see
if I can give the girls a hand.

29:01.055 --> 29:04.183
Still, it's not the same
as a family.

29:04.426 --> 29:05.484
Indeed, it isn't.

29:06.795 --> 29:10.322
I think Tess blames me
for taking her away from her family.

29:10.532 --> 29:12.329
Her country.

29:12.801 --> 29:15.634
We're supposed to be
starting our own out here.

29:17.505 --> 29:20.702
You know, maybe it's the accident
that shook something loose.

29:20.875 --> 29:24.470
Well, there's no substitute for family,
that's for sure.

29:24.646 --> 29:26.637
You're not saying
you're giving up hope?

29:26.815 --> 29:27.975
No.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.743
I'm not saying that.

29:30.985 --> 29:32.885
It's just...

29:33.054 --> 29:35.147
...you get to a point, you know?

29:35.323 --> 29:38.224
You start to see things
like they are.

29:39.661 --> 29:42.323
Sure never pictured
a life without kids.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.097
The pity of it is,
there are children...

29:48.269 --> 29:53.263
...just like those boys next door,
desperate for a good home.

29:53.675 --> 29:58.044
And here you are,
desperate for children.

30:03.251 --> 30:05.719
You got a point there, Father.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.547
We want a kid...

30:08.356 --> 30:11.018
...and they need parents.

30:11.192 --> 30:15.094
We could just line them up
and pick which one we like the best.

30:34.148 --> 30:35.547
They get you?

30:35.717 --> 30:37.275
What happened?

30:37.519 --> 30:39.885
My glasses got knocked off.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.556
We saved you some.

30:45.293 --> 30:47.659
I'm going to bed.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.264
Come on, Spit.

31:40.848 --> 31:42.782
Dad.

31:48.523 --> 31:49.547
Thank you, Vernon.

31:51.025 --> 31:52.720
More tea?

31:53.895 --> 31:55.328
There you are.

31:55.496 --> 31:58.659
I want you all to take notice...

31:58.833 --> 32:02.098
...of how sharp young Vernon
looks this morning.

32:04.973 --> 32:07.498
Good on you, son.

32:16.618 --> 32:18.711
You all right?

32:24.559 --> 32:27.585
If it's all right,
I'd like to say grace.

32:28.997 --> 32:30.897
That'd be lovely, Vernon.

32:31.132 --> 32:35.068
O Lord, we beseech thee
in your wondrous grace...

32:35.236 --> 32:39.764
...and thank you for the food
we're about to receive. Amen.

32:40.008 --> 32:42.340
Amen.

32:45.747 --> 32:47.681
Got you.

32:48.650 --> 32:49.947
Hey, get back.

32:50.151 --> 32:53.052
No. Don't leave me here. No.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.348
- No fair.
- Yeah.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.251
- I got you already.
- You didn't.

32:57.425 --> 32:59.950
- You're it.
- No.

33:00.161 --> 33:04.427
If you get me,
I'll kiss Sister Beatrice.

33:05.867 --> 33:08.927
Hey, you can't run around
the cross.

33:33.461 --> 33:35.588
Where is my precious Misty?

33:35.763 --> 33:37.458
He's been adopted.

33:38.566 --> 33:41.501
He was always the best of the lot.

34:17.004 --> 34:19.335
You the one living in the cave?

34:19.507 --> 34:22.943
I don't live there.
I just come up here to observe.

34:26.347 --> 34:28.007
You can come up if you want.

34:35.022 --> 34:37.013
You one of them orphan kids?

34:37.257 --> 34:39.123
Yeah.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.958
- What's your name?
- Maps.

34:43.130 --> 34:45.964
So, what are you observing?

34:46.134 --> 34:48.466
You had a good look at these rocks?

34:48.636 --> 34:50.194
I've seen them.

34:50.371 --> 34:52.804
Haven't you noticed
anything strange?

34:53.007 --> 34:55.804
They are weird-looking.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.874
They were left here by aliens.

35:00.214 --> 35:04.310
Same as Stonehenge.
You ever heard of Stonehenge?

35:04.485 --> 35:05.577
Kind of.

35:05.787 --> 35:07.516
Well, it's the same.

35:07.688 --> 35:10.885
When they come back,
I'll be ready.

35:11.058 --> 35:12.753
People from outer space?

35:12.927 --> 35:15.157
Of course.

35:26.007 --> 35:28.271
I don't guess you see
many women where you're from.

35:28.442 --> 35:33.038
Nuns, mostly. Nuns.

35:33.414 --> 35:35.905
Yeah, I've seen some of those.

35:37.451 --> 35:40.181
Want some? It's my last one.

36:16.791 --> 36:18.725
By the way...

36:18.893 --> 36:21.123
...my name is Lucy.

36:21.295 --> 36:23.490
Good to meet you.

36:33.307 --> 36:36.333
- Hey, look, what's that?
- Yeah?

36:36.510 --> 36:38.239
Come on, Spit.

36:38.412 --> 36:40.471
- Hey, wait up.
- No.

36:40.648 --> 36:41.672
Dirty trickster.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.020
Look at all this.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.861
Oh, check out the net.

36:59.033 --> 37:03.436
And this is a spear.
What do you reckon he does with this?

37:08.009 --> 37:10.773
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

37:17.218 --> 37:19.550
We was just looking around.

37:21.422 --> 37:24.949
Seeing as you can see so well,
can you read that sign?

37:27.328 --> 37:31.025
That's a heavy line you got there.
What are you fishing for, Moby Dick?

37:31.198 --> 37:35.294
When it rains, Spark's the best
fisherman at Bible Creek.

37:36.637 --> 37:38.628
You see a creek around here, boy-o?

37:38.806 --> 37:42.298
He's worried I'll catch Henry
before he does.

37:44.145 --> 37:46.807
What do you know about Henry?

37:47.181 --> 37:49.809
A fish is a fish.

37:51.686 --> 37:55.816
Henry's a king of fishes.
He's a masterpiece.

37:55.990 --> 37:59.482
He was swimming in these waters
long before you were born.

37:59.660 --> 38:03.255
He's bigger and smarter
than you will ever be.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.658
Get lost.

38:14.542 --> 38:18.239
Can't I make a suggestion
without getting my bloody head bit off?

38:18.412 --> 38:21.347
It's not a suggestion.
You gave up.

38:21.515 --> 38:24.609
For chrissake, Tess.
Listen to me.

38:24.785 --> 38:27.345
All right? I'm not saying
that we won't have a baby.

38:27.521 --> 38:29.455
All I'm saying
is we should talk about...

38:29.623 --> 38:32.592
...adopting one of those kids
that needs a home.

38:36.864 --> 38:39.526
I talked to someone
at the archdiocese.

38:39.700 --> 38:41.361
It's possible.

38:41.535 --> 38:43.628
That's all I'm saying.

38:45.773 --> 38:49.231
So you've decided.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.105
No.

38:52.813 --> 38:54.872
Tess... No...

38:55.049 --> 38:56.607
Tess, you're not listening to me.

38:56.784 --> 39:01.084
No. It's your fault
I can't have babies.

39:13.834 --> 39:16.166
Whoa, look at that.

39:16.337 --> 39:18.999
- Come on, put some more on.
- You don't need any more.

39:19.173 --> 39:22.142
She's getting naked.

39:23.044 --> 39:26.480
No. Guys, wait.
Wait. Go slow.

40:22.870 --> 40:25.168
Quick, run.

40:31.645 --> 40:33.704
I'll yell.

40:34.515 --> 40:37.712
Misty, I know there's gotta be
a very good explanation for that...

40:37.885 --> 40:39.876
...so why don't you come out
and tell us what it is?

40:40.054 --> 40:42.420
I promise nothing
will happen to you.

40:44.925 --> 40:46.324
No.

40:47.328 --> 40:49.592
Just remember,
I keep you from getting killed...

40:49.763 --> 40:51.993
...and soon we'll all be back
at St. Greg's.

40:52.166 --> 40:54.726
That's what you think.

42:28.729 --> 42:30.424
Boys...

42:30.598 --> 42:32.828
...I have great news.

42:34.768 --> 42:37.794
Father Scully
is taking confession today.

42:37.972 --> 42:41.669
Clean slate.
Just in time for Christmas, eh?

42:41.842 --> 42:43.139
- Great.
- Beauty.

42:43.310 --> 42:46.973
- Ripper.
- Yeah, great.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.481
Next.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.814
Vernon.

43:02.029 --> 43:03.621
What's troubling you, son?

43:03.797 --> 43:06.357
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

43:06.533 --> 43:08.524
How long is it
since your last confession?

43:08.702 --> 43:11.466
About three weeks.

43:12.673 --> 43:15.164
I've had some unclean thoughts.

43:15.843 --> 43:18.710
And I pulled a face
at one of the sisters.

43:19.380 --> 43:20.642
Is that all?

43:20.814 --> 43:22.748
Not exactly.

43:24.318 --> 43:28.482
Oh, come on, lad.
I'm gonna need basting in a minute.

43:30.357 --> 43:33.485
Let's say there was something
you wanted.

43:34.928 --> 43:38.386
You know, something you wanted
more than anything.

43:40.601 --> 43:42.660
And you had an advantage...

43:43.103 --> 43:46.004
...because the others don't know.

43:46.807 --> 43:49.742
What is the point in giving it up?

43:49.910 --> 43:51.935
I mean...

43:52.112 --> 43:55.343
Look, I can't guess, son.
You're gonna have to tell me.

43:56.517 --> 44:00.954
It'll ease your mind
if you unburden yourself.

44:01.121 --> 44:03.589
I heard something.

44:03.957 --> 44:06.255
Can you tell what he's saying?

44:06.927 --> 44:09.327
Something about...

44:09.630 --> 44:12.030
...big breasts.

44:12.199 --> 44:14.133
What?

44:14.301 --> 44:19.261
If you keep this knowledge to yourself,
are you being fair with the other boys?

44:19.907 --> 44:22.774
I think you should tell them.

44:22.943 --> 44:27.471
The burdens and the joys of this world
are always better shared.

44:27.648 --> 44:29.138
Do you understand me?

44:29.717 --> 44:31.275
I've got to share.

44:31.452 --> 44:32.714
That's right.

44:33.220 --> 44:35.950
Now, for your penance,
you say five Hail Marys...

44:36.123 --> 44:37.784
Something else happened last night.

44:38.459 --> 44:41.428
Save it till next time. I'm cooked.

44:45.466 --> 44:48.094
Oh, Hail Mary.
Oh, Hail Mary.

45:02.983 --> 45:04.917
It's time to come clean.

45:05.085 --> 45:06.916
Get off me.
My arm can't breathe.

45:07.087 --> 45:09.681
Tell us or we'll slag you.

45:11.458 --> 45:13.619
Now then,
I wouldn't want anything...

45:13.794 --> 45:17.594
...coming out of Spit's mouth
landing on my face.

45:23.103 --> 45:24.127
I'll tell you.

45:26.540 --> 45:30.135
Fearless and Teresa
are gonna adopt one of us.

45:31.044 --> 45:32.671
I swear.

45:33.781 --> 45:35.772
Let him up.

45:39.119 --> 45:41.280
- I swear.
- When?

45:41.455 --> 45:43.320
I don't know.

45:43.490 --> 45:47.358
Before we leave. They're gonna choose
which one of us they like best.

45:47.528 --> 45:49.462
Why would they want us?
We're too old.

45:49.630 --> 45:51.188
Speak for yourself.

45:51.365 --> 45:53.833
We're not as old as you are.

45:59.573 --> 46:02.133
Did they say who they want?

46:05.479 --> 46:07.379
You don't know which it is.

46:15.189 --> 46:18.681
- Where are the others?
- I'm not sure.

46:46.854 --> 46:49.482
My real name's Vernon.

46:51.625 --> 46:55.493
You know,
Africa is just over there.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.632
Vernon, do you remember
your parents?

47:10.644 --> 47:13.078
I think I do...

47:13.614 --> 47:16.913
...but maybe it was a photo.

47:18.151 --> 47:22.315
My dad was tall and tan.

47:22.523 --> 47:26.653
And my mother
had long, dark hair.

47:27.060 --> 47:29.551
She was smiling.

47:31.164 --> 47:34.065
They died in a car accident.

47:34.735 --> 47:39.536
I don't know why I wasn't there.
Nobody ever told me.

47:41.408 --> 47:46.573
If my parents were still alive,
I'd never let them out of my sight.

47:51.318 --> 47:53.445
What's he doing?

47:53.620 --> 47:55.417
That's Socrates.

47:55.589 --> 47:59.958
Shellback says he catches fish
and feeds them to the cats.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.752
Have you seen him do it?

48:01.929 --> 48:06.992
No, but I believe
a lot of things I can't see.

48:07.935 --> 48:09.960
Me too.

48:28.355 --> 48:31.085
You ever think about
running away?

48:31.792 --> 48:33.555
There's no place to run.

48:33.727 --> 48:37.163
When I get 18,
they make you leave anyway.

48:44.671 --> 48:45.695
Like music?

48:54.715 --> 48:57.411
So, what do you do
for fun out there?

49:00.320 --> 49:05.019
When it floods,
we can swim or go fishing.

49:05.192 --> 49:09.060
We have a footy team and a choir.

49:10.163 --> 49:11.755
Can you sing?

49:12.165 --> 49:14.030
Not really.

49:14.201 --> 49:15.930
Try singing this.

49:16.103 --> 49:18.571
I'm no good.

49:22.142 --> 49:24.906
Give it a go
and I'll give you a prize.

49:45.866 --> 49:47.163
Listen.

50:11.124 --> 50:12.421
What'd you think?

50:12.592 --> 50:13.957
That was good.

50:20.133 --> 50:22.499
That was your first kiss, I bet.

50:29.943 --> 50:32.468
I can teach you if you want.

50:44.124 --> 50:48.185
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying
I'm a better rider than Fearless.

50:48.361 --> 50:51.956
All I'm saying is that
what he does ain't as hard as it looks.

50:52.132 --> 50:56.796
You're full of it.
You've never ridden a bike in your life.

50:57.804 --> 51:00.864
It's all right to be jealous, Misty,
my little mate.

51:01.041 --> 51:04.807
Me and Fearless have something
in common that you'll never have.

51:07.447 --> 51:10.507
Hey, what was that for?

51:10.817 --> 51:13.149
Get back here.

51:14.287 --> 51:17.381
Get you later, you little mongrel.

51:54.327 --> 51:56.261
We've come to tell you, Vernon...

51:56.429 --> 51:58.021
...you're to be adopted.

51:58.198 --> 52:01.565
You can stay here
as long as you like.

52:01.735 --> 52:06.570
And now for some
excellent cartwheels.

52:24.724 --> 52:29.559
He's not good for much, but at least
my uncle can make decent grog.

52:36.102 --> 52:38.434
Who do you think they'll choose?

52:38.939 --> 52:40.930
I don't know.

52:41.441 --> 52:44.774
Spit's clever.
He can fix most anything.

52:45.445 --> 52:48.471
Misty's the youngest,
and he's a good artist.

52:48.915 --> 52:53.477
And Spark's got good energy.
He's the fastest, wins all the races.

52:53.653 --> 52:57.589
What about you? Aren't you good
at anything? I know it's not singing.

52:57.757 --> 53:00.225
Well, I don't wanna be adopted.

53:00.393 --> 53:03.487
What's the big deal
about parents anyway?

54:20.740 --> 54:22.935
Where have you been?

54:24.244 --> 54:26.906
I think Skipper's dead.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.344
What do you mean dead?

54:29.516 --> 54:31.882
Well, lads...

54:35.188 --> 54:36.587
...the skipper's...

54:38.058 --> 54:40.993
...a bit under the weather tonight...

54:41.161 --> 54:44.927
...so I suppose it'll be
bread and jam for tea.

54:45.098 --> 54:51.264
Anyway, as the next
highest-ranking officer...

54:51.471 --> 54:55.498
...she has asked me to carry on.

54:55.675 --> 54:59.771
I think it's appropriate...

55:00.613 --> 55:03.047
...and not out of place...

55:04.918 --> 55:09.480
...to give you your Christmas gifts
tonight.

55:09.856 --> 55:11.949
- Any objections?
- No.

55:12.625 --> 55:14.991
Right, good show.

55:16.496 --> 55:19.397
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks, Bandy.

55:19.566 --> 55:22.262
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Bandy.

55:22.435 --> 55:24.869
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

55:26.039 --> 55:29.566
- And merry Christmas.
- Thanks, Bandy. Merry Christmas.

55:36.383 --> 55:37.407
What is it?

55:38.318 --> 55:41.253
Well, I don't suppose
you've seen one of these...

55:41.421 --> 55:43.548
...but every ship has one.

55:43.723 --> 55:45.884
It's called a gyroscope.

55:51.297 --> 55:54.095
Keeps your vessel balanced.

56:06.112 --> 56:08.672
It's like the ship's conscience.

56:22.362 --> 56:25.593
I'll leave the bread and jam
on the sideboard.

56:26.599 --> 56:28.760
Thanks.

56:30.203 --> 56:34.299
If Misty's right,
they'll send us packing.

56:35.008 --> 56:38.500
- Misty's always making stuff up.
- We've gotta go and have a closer look.

56:39.112 --> 56:42.275
- I'm not going in their bedroom.
- Me neither.

56:42.449 --> 56:44.849
Then Misty and me will go.

56:45.018 --> 56:47.782
When Bandy goes out, we'll go in.

56:57.297 --> 57:01.461
Remember, we don't know anything.
So just...

57:01.634 --> 57:03.864
...look cheerful.

57:05.405 --> 57:06.497
What happened to Misty?

57:06.673 --> 57:09.471
He's shining his glasses.

57:14.714 --> 57:17.808
Hey. Merry Christmas, boys.

57:26.192 --> 57:28.820
- Where's Misty?
- He's coming.

57:28.995 --> 57:31.395
- He's always late.
- He can't be trusted.

57:35.768 --> 57:37.565
Here he is.

57:37.737 --> 57:41.195
- What do you got there, mate?
- I made you two a present.

57:41.374 --> 57:42.841
Thanks, buddy.

57:46.079 --> 57:47.103
All right.

57:48.548 --> 57:53.076
Now that you're all here,
me and Tess have got a surprise for you.

57:56.122 --> 58:00.923
Now, we weren't real sure about the
sizes, but they all got drawstrings. So...

58:02.395 --> 58:04.556
- Misty.
- Merry Christmas.

58:04.931 --> 58:06.262
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

58:06.432 --> 58:07.763
- Merry Christmas.
- Spark.

58:10.203 --> 58:12.262
Merry Christmas, boys.

58:13.940 --> 58:17.876
Well, go on, open them up.
Open them up.

58:23.983 --> 58:26.144
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

58:27.453 --> 58:29.250
Where's Bandy and Skipper?

58:31.558 --> 58:36.154
Well, Mrs. McAnsh is a bit sick,
but Bandy will be by later.

58:36.329 --> 58:37.387
Okay.

58:39.265 --> 58:42.792
- All right, that's French for "let's eat."
- Sit where you like.

59:22.742 --> 59:24.801
Skipper?

59:24.978 --> 59:27.139
Skipper?

59:35.455 --> 59:36.479
Skipper?

01:00:05.013 --> 01:00:08.176
She wasn't such a bad old stick.

01:00:09.885 --> 01:00:12.376
She looks like a car without a driver.

01:00:20.228 --> 01:00:24.790
I saw Bandy giving her pills,
but I never knew how bad she was.

01:00:27.169 --> 01:00:30.036
I hope she didn't suffer.

01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:36.501
Well, she's probably up there,
in heaven...

01:00:36.678 --> 01:00:39.704
...looking down on us, thinking:

01:00:39.881 --> 01:00:43.044
"What's those silly buggers doing?"

01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:49.013
Go on. Touch her.

01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:52.683
- I'm not touching her.
- I will if you go first.

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:54.089
Don't be a nancy.

01:01:08.777 --> 01:01:11.143
Pray with me.

01:01:13.548 --> 01:01:16.381
I'll look after her, doctor.

01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:18.109
I'll be back tomorrow evening.

01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:24.759
Father.

01:01:34.136 --> 01:01:35.797
Father...

01:01:35.971 --> 01:01:38.735
...tell the boys to come in.

01:01:51.953 --> 01:01:54.285
Sorry. We just wanted to...

01:01:54.456 --> 01:01:57.118
Wanted to know
what was happening. I know.

01:01:59.995 --> 01:02:01.519
Come closer.

01:02:08.336 --> 01:02:12.636
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.
I must look a fright.

01:02:13.642 --> 01:02:17.169
It was selfish of me
to invite you here...

01:02:17.345 --> 01:02:21.281
...but I thought it'd be nice to have
some young energy in the Cove.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:23.941
And I was right.

01:02:24.953 --> 01:02:26.511
It's just...

01:02:26.688 --> 01:02:29.953
...my disease won't cooperate.

01:02:32.194 --> 01:02:34.628
What's wrong with you?

01:02:34.963 --> 01:02:37.557
I got cancer.

01:02:40.535 --> 01:02:42.662
Will we have to go back now?

01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:48.205
I was hoping you'd stay.

01:02:50.312 --> 01:02:52.974
Bandy's taking it hard...

01:02:53.715 --> 01:02:58.379
...and I know you boys
can help lift his spirit.

01:03:42.597 --> 01:03:45.031
Well, it's the calling.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.465
They say no matter how hard
you don't want to do it...

01:03:48.637 --> 01:03:53.074
...if God wants you, he'll get you.

01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:56.773
But what if you just didn't do it?

01:03:56.945 --> 01:04:00.403
- I mean, you could refuse.
- That's what I'm saying.

01:04:00.582 --> 01:04:03.050
You can't not do it.

01:04:03.618 --> 01:04:06.883
I had a teacher once
who told me she was called.

01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:09.285
She tried to fight it.

01:04:09.457 --> 01:04:11.118
She traveled through Europe...

01:04:11.293 --> 01:04:14.785
...drinking, having sex
like nobody's business.

01:04:14.963 --> 01:04:19.332
But she knew she couldn't be happy
until she was a nun.

01:04:21.636 --> 01:04:23.797
Do you think you'll get called?

01:04:23.972 --> 01:04:26.463
I sure hope not.

01:04:27.275 --> 01:04:29.573
But it's like you're metal...

01:04:29.744 --> 01:04:35.341
...and God's the biggest,
most powerful magnet ever made.

01:04:40.121 --> 01:04:42.112
So do you think you'll be a priest?

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.588
Hell, no.

01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:50.459
I go to a Catholic school,
but it's not like they turn you into one.

01:04:50.632 --> 01:04:53.294
They teach you other stuff.

01:04:54.469 --> 01:04:56.699
Father Maps.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.776
I've been a very bad girl.

01:05:04.179 --> 01:05:08.172
Why have you been a bad girl,
Sister Lucy?

01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:15.617
Well, Father,
I've been thinking about a boy.

01:05:18.026 --> 01:05:19.960
You have?

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:24.625
I like him.

01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.901
I let him touch me.

01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:42.173
Everywhere.

01:06:02.237 --> 01:06:05.434
Kiss me on the neck. I like that.

01:06:11.446 --> 01:06:12.936
Come closer.

01:06:15.383 --> 01:06:17.578
Pull down your pants.

01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:52.216
Hey! Hey!

01:06:52.387 --> 01:06:54.548
Get out of my boat!

01:06:54.723 --> 01:06:58.989
Nobody gave you permission!
Get out!

01:07:54.249 --> 01:07:57.343
Serves you right.

01:08:46.935 --> 01:08:50.803
I want you to always remember me
as your first.

01:08:51.372 --> 01:08:53.703
No worries.

01:09:03.852 --> 01:09:05.716
Where?

01:09:05.886 --> 01:09:07.184
Where?

01:09:07.354 --> 01:09:08.947
I can't see anything.

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:14.420
I told you. You're seeing things.

01:09:18.733 --> 01:09:22.533
Hey, Maps,
you can see her public hair.

01:09:30.377 --> 01:09:32.437
What's on your neck?

01:09:37.719 --> 01:09:39.983
What did you do?

01:09:41.288 --> 01:09:45.089
Maybe you'll figure it out
when you're older.

01:10:10.818 --> 01:10:13.981
Let me go. Come on, get off.

01:10:30.638 --> 01:10:31.935
Henry.

01:10:35.677 --> 01:10:39.613
I caught Henry!
He's mine! Yes! Yes!

01:10:40.048 --> 01:10:43.506
Yes, I caught him!
I told you I would and I did!

01:10:43.685 --> 01:10:46.882
Yes! I'm the best fisherman
in the Cove! Yes!

01:10:47.488 --> 01:10:50.787
Oh, yes!
You saw me, I caught him!

01:10:51.326 --> 01:10:52.987
Yes!

01:10:53.461 --> 01:10:54.621
Told you I'd catch him!

01:11:19.654 --> 01:11:22.088
You could have him if you want.

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:25.889
You could stuff him
and put him up in your hut.

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:37.904
Get a spade...

01:11:38.072 --> 01:11:41.599
...and give him a proper burial.

01:12:56.551 --> 01:12:58.178
Mr. Watson?

01:12:58.352 --> 01:13:00.946
What's the picture like?

01:13:01.122 --> 01:13:04.285
I'm up top.
Can you make out anything?

01:13:04.459 --> 01:13:07.826
Should be something Christmassy.

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:11.664
Is Lucy here?

01:13:14.068 --> 01:13:16.935
Lucy? No.
She's gone up to Darwin to her dad.

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:22.176
When is she getting back?

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.672
Maybe next summer.

01:13:53.007 --> 01:13:56.170
I'll give you some to take for Bandy.

01:13:57.879 --> 01:14:00.074
I don't mean to be rude...

01:14:00.248 --> 01:14:03.740
...but this is the best meal I've had
since I got here.

01:14:06.154 --> 01:14:09.123
It's the best meal I've ever had.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.251
This is the best meal...

01:14:15.429 --> 01:14:16.691
...l'll ever have.

01:14:31.078 --> 01:14:33.546
Aren't you hungry, Maps?

01:14:37.251 --> 01:14:41.085
You know, I've never been
to the outback. What's it like?

01:14:41.656 --> 01:14:43.954
You can't fish unless it floods.

01:14:44.158 --> 01:14:45.182
It's boring.

01:14:46.594 --> 01:14:48.357
It's a hundred times better here.

01:14:51.365 --> 01:14:54.027
How about you, Maps?

01:14:54.202 --> 01:14:56.397
Are you homesick?

01:14:56.904 --> 01:14:58.735
I like the outback all right.

01:14:59.974 --> 01:15:01.908
You can count on things out there.

01:15:05.279 --> 01:15:07.941
I guess it's what you're used to.

01:15:11.986 --> 01:15:13.647
You well and truly
screwed yourself.

01:15:13.821 --> 01:15:16.051
You might as well have said
you didn't want to be adopted.

01:15:16.224 --> 01:15:19.625
You think getting adopted
is gonna fix anything?

01:15:19.794 --> 01:15:23.924
You don't get it. Everyone leaves.

01:15:28.769 --> 01:15:33.797
<i>Up to this time, Maps thought
we were all in the same boat.<i></i></i>

01:15:35.443 --> 01:15:40.142
<i>Now he realized he was hanging
off the side on his own.<i></i></i>

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:50.855
<i>I never fully understood why Maps
reached out to Fearless that night...<i></i></i>

01:15:51.025 --> 01:15:53.858
<i>...and I never asked.<i></i></i>

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:11.000
- Tickets for the Wall of Death.

01:16:11.178 --> 01:16:13.646
Get your tickets
for the Wall of Death.

01:16:18.986 --> 01:16:22.012
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:24.123
...the most bone-rattling...

01:16:24.292 --> 01:16:26.487
...jaw-clenching...

01:16:26.661 --> 01:16:28.060
...nail-biting...

01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:33.189
...death-defying act
you've ever seen.

01:16:33.367 --> 01:16:38.805
The one, the only,
the bravest man on two wheels...

01:16:38.973 --> 01:16:40.804
...Fearless Forte!

01:16:53.888 --> 01:16:56.083
Get your tickets
for the Wall of Death.

01:16:56.290 --> 01:17:00.556
The bravest man on two wheels...

01:17:01.696 --> 01:17:04.392
Son, he's just over there.

01:17:37.264 --> 01:17:41.200
Go on. Get a move on.
It's not smoko yet.

01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:55.241
What are you doing here?

01:17:57.184 --> 01:17:58.412
Maps. Hey...

01:17:59.253 --> 01:18:01.153
You're shit.

01:18:01.322 --> 01:18:02.653
- Maps...
- You lied.

01:18:02.857 --> 01:18:04.950
You're a liar like all the rest.

01:18:05.126 --> 01:18:07.993
You made out you're some
kind of a hero, but you're nothing.

01:18:08.162 --> 01:18:09.652
You're worse than nothing.

01:18:09.964 --> 01:18:11.454
It's a job, man.

01:18:12.166 --> 01:18:16.967
Stop lying. Like you could ever
adopt one of us.

01:18:17.138 --> 01:18:20.574
Like you've got the right
to be our father.

01:18:20.741 --> 01:18:23.232
You're a nobody.
We don't need you.

01:18:23.411 --> 01:18:25.072
- Maps...
- We don't need anyone.

01:18:27.948 --> 01:18:29.438
Maps.

01:18:29.617 --> 01:18:30.914
Do you want a lift home?

01:18:31.085 --> 01:18:33.019
Clive!

01:18:34.021 --> 01:18:37.115
Get your ass back here now.

01:18:58.446 --> 01:19:00.937
Where have you been?

01:19:03.017 --> 01:19:05.645
- Where's the others?
- Looking for you.

01:19:07.321 --> 01:19:09.312
We've been worried about you.

01:19:10.057 --> 01:19:12.457
You must let us know
where you are, son.

01:19:16.197 --> 01:19:17.323
Son?

01:19:58.339 --> 01:19:59.704
What are you doing?

01:20:04.512 --> 01:20:06.036
Get your things. Now.

01:20:06.213 --> 01:20:09.239
We're leaving. Come on!

01:20:09.917 --> 01:20:11.612
- Get your stuff.
- Where are we going?

01:20:11.785 --> 01:20:14.583
Home. It's all been a lie.

01:20:18.225 --> 01:20:21.752
- Just shut up and get your stuff!
- Stop!

01:20:27.501 --> 01:20:29.025
Misty, get off!

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.644
I'm trying to look after you!

01:21:14.715 --> 01:21:15.807
Nice spot you got here.

01:21:23.424 --> 01:21:24.686
Shit.

01:21:25.192 --> 01:21:27.683
The little bloke do that?

01:21:28.762 --> 01:21:31.458
You guys fight worse than brothers.

01:21:31.966 --> 01:21:33.957
We are brothers.

01:21:35.002 --> 01:21:38.836
Leave me alone. I'll be all right.

01:21:39.306 --> 01:21:41.706
Yeah, I don't doubt that.

01:21:42.176 --> 01:21:43.438
What about the others?

01:21:44.378 --> 01:21:47.211
You just gonna abandon them
because you're mad at Lucy?

01:21:47.381 --> 01:21:49.815
You don't know anything about it.

01:21:54.021 --> 01:21:56.956
Well, at least there's something
that I do know.

01:21:58.025 --> 01:22:00.960
You're wrong what you said to me.

01:22:02.029 --> 01:22:04.725
Teresa and me
would make good parents.

01:22:04.898 --> 01:22:08.527
And we would've had a load of kids
around now if it weren't for me.

01:22:08.969 --> 01:22:12.063
I crashed the bike
with Tess on the back.

01:22:13.507 --> 01:22:16.533
We used to be a team in the shows.

01:22:18.979 --> 01:22:22.039
She spent half a year in hospital.

01:22:24.318 --> 01:22:27.481
And I tried to keep it going
on my own, but...

01:22:32.826 --> 01:22:34.350
Does Teresa know?

01:22:36.363 --> 01:22:38.729
Tess always knows.

01:23:48.202 --> 01:23:49.328
Help!

01:23:54.775 --> 01:23:57.073
Help me!

01:23:57.711 --> 01:23:59.770
Maps!

01:24:00.714 --> 01:24:01.806
Maps!

01:24:03.717 --> 01:24:09.485
Help! Help! Anyone, help!

01:24:14.661 --> 01:24:18.620
Maps! Help, it's Misty!

01:24:20.134 --> 01:24:22.864
Hang on, Misty!

01:24:23.670 --> 01:24:25.501
- What happened?
- The rip got him.

01:24:25.672 --> 01:24:29.039
- He fell off the rocks.
- Get help.

01:24:31.879 --> 01:24:34.507
You can't swim!

01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:06.706
Look at us. We're swimming.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.348
I'm drowning.

01:25:10.384 --> 01:25:12.147
Hang onto me, catch your breath.

01:26:39.673 --> 01:26:41.300
Shellback!

01:26:56.023 --> 01:26:58.924
Really, we tried to save you.
We did.

01:26:59.092 --> 01:27:01.117
I was trying to save you, I swear.

01:27:01.295 --> 01:27:03.286
I came into the water.
It was up to my neck.

01:27:03.463 --> 01:27:06.296
I went to the McAnsh's, and...
But then I went to Shellback.

01:27:06.466 --> 01:27:08.024
How you feeling, boys?

01:27:08.201 --> 01:27:10.431
I'm better than I was.

01:27:11.038 --> 01:27:12.335
I gotta say, mate...

01:27:12.506 --> 01:27:16.135
...you're braver than me, going out
there not knowing how to swim.

01:27:16.877 --> 01:27:18.674
Well done.

01:27:18.845 --> 01:27:20.836
I was just a couple of feet
away from you.

01:27:21.014 --> 01:27:22.538
You were 75 yards out
or something.

01:27:22.716 --> 01:27:25.446
- I could almost grab...
- Who wants some soup? Hey?

01:27:26.053 --> 01:27:28.021
Yeah, okay.

01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:33.057
I might have saved you. But l...
Something just pulled me away.

01:27:33.627 --> 01:27:35.788
Something just pulled me.

01:27:35.963 --> 01:27:37.521
Come on.

01:27:37.698 --> 01:27:40.132
So, what do we got?

01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:45.303
Did you see her?

01:27:58.585 --> 01:28:00.712
Thanks.

01:28:24.344 --> 01:28:26.676
I suppose you're the one.

01:28:26.847 --> 01:28:28.109
You showed us all up.

01:28:28.281 --> 01:28:32.081
Yeah. For an old bloke,
you came through.

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:35.854
I don't want to be adopted.

01:28:37.591 --> 01:28:39.559
You don't?

01:28:41.128 --> 01:28:43.062
No.

01:28:44.498 --> 01:28:48.366
I like... Well, I like things
the way they are.

01:29:03.116 --> 01:29:04.811
My money's on you, Misty.

01:29:49.429 --> 01:29:54.128
<i>We were running out of time and hope,
and there was still no answer.<i></i></i>

01:29:54.301 --> 01:29:57.532
<i>No one seemed to notice
that the biggest moment of my life...<i></i></i>

01:29:57.704 --> 01:29:59.968
<i>...was about to get left behind.<i></i></i>

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:02.608
I'm tired of waiting.

01:30:09.082 --> 01:30:11.710
Come through. Come through.

01:30:13.687 --> 01:30:16.986
So guess you're all packed up.

01:30:18.024 --> 01:30:21.016
Sit down. Sit down.

01:30:23.497 --> 01:30:26.159
I wanna know
if you're gonna adopt me.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.569
I heard you tell Father Scully
you were gonna adopt one of us.

01:30:31.638 --> 01:30:34.163
If you're gonna adopt anyone,
it ought to be Misty.

01:30:34.474 --> 01:30:37.238
- Not so fast. I've got qualities.
- I can run fast.

01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:39.901
- You can't even stay conscious.
- Hey, boys. Boys.

01:30:42.816 --> 01:30:44.374
We've made up our minds.

01:30:52.092 --> 01:30:54.526
We wish we could adopt all of you.

01:30:58.165 --> 01:31:00.224
You're all such wonderful boys.

01:31:01.835 --> 01:31:03.268
We've put in the paperwork...

01:31:05.372 --> 01:31:08.170
...and it's just gonna take
a little time.

01:31:20.387 --> 01:31:22.685
Misty...

01:31:23.156 --> 01:31:26.182
...we want you to be our son.

01:31:30.063 --> 01:31:33.362
And we hope
you want us for your parents.

01:31:33.533 --> 01:31:35.797
We're not perfect, mate...

01:31:36.436 --> 01:31:38.927
...but we could love you.

01:31:43.043 --> 01:31:44.374
Good on you, mate.

01:31:56.489 --> 01:31:57.979
Yeah.

01:31:58.191 --> 01:32:01.058
Misty's the one, for sure.

01:32:16.710 --> 01:32:20.168
Well, hey, it's not like
we're never gonna see you again.

01:32:20.347 --> 01:32:22.440
I mean, we're sure
to come back and visit...

01:32:22.616 --> 01:32:27.144
...and if you're ever in the mood for
some boiled lamb, you can come visit us.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:30.153
You boys are gonna come back
and say goodbye before you go?

01:32:30.323 --> 01:32:32.416
Oh, no worries.

01:32:41.434 --> 01:32:43.629
We'll see him again.

01:32:44.137 --> 01:32:45.968
See you, fellas.

01:32:48.742 --> 01:32:52.303
Just remember, Misty, no matter what,
you're still a December boy.

01:32:52.479 --> 01:32:54.538
Yeah.

01:32:55.682 --> 01:32:58.150
- Hey.
- Got you.

01:32:58.752 --> 01:33:01.312
You're gonna have to run
faster than that.

01:33:01.788 --> 01:33:03.653
Hey.

01:33:05.292 --> 01:33:07.556
Come get me.

01:33:12.365 --> 01:33:13.832
Let's go get some souvenirs.

01:33:14.367 --> 01:33:17.336
Get a crab for Sister Edna.

01:33:18.505 --> 01:33:20.530
Look at this.

01:33:20.707 --> 01:33:23.904
Spit. Quick, before it gets away.

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:43.192
I don't want you
to be mad at me...

01:33:43.897 --> 01:33:46.161
...but I can't stay.

01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:48.858
If I was ever gonna be adopted...

01:33:49.035 --> 01:33:53.495
...you'd be the best parents
I could have, and that's no lie.

01:33:56.543 --> 01:33:59.341
But I've already got a family.

01:34:09.122 --> 01:34:10.885
They'd be lost without me.

01:34:11.057 --> 01:34:13.184
I know.

01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:16.893
No hard feelings?

01:34:17.063 --> 01:34:19.827
No hard feelings, Misty.

01:34:29.376 --> 01:34:31.310
Go on.

01:34:31.478 --> 01:34:33.537
Thank you.

01:34:33.713 --> 01:34:35.044
Look what I found over here.

01:34:35.215 --> 01:34:37.877
- Give it back, that's mine.
- No, I found it.

01:34:38.051 --> 01:34:40.747
Hey, come on.

01:34:47.427 --> 01:34:50.260
Well, lads, this is it.

01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:51.920
I thought...

01:34:52.098 --> 01:34:56.660
...if you wanted a keepsake,
you might like to take the signal flags.

01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:58.770
Thanks.

01:35:03.243 --> 01:35:06.508
The boys would like
to say goodbye, Skipper.

01:35:13.887 --> 01:35:15.980
Thanks, Skipper.

01:35:18.491 --> 01:35:20.322
Thanks.

01:35:21.661 --> 01:35:23.458
Hey.

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:25.996
Thanks, Skipper.

01:35:28.668 --> 01:35:30.761
Goodbye.

01:35:35.608 --> 01:35:38.509
Okay, orphans, disembark.

01:35:38.678 --> 01:35:43.115
Left, right, left, right, left, right...

01:35:57.497 --> 01:35:58.521
See you, Bandy.

01:35:58.698 --> 01:36:00.029
See you, Father.

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.361
- See you, boys.
- Thank you, Bandy.

01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:04.801
- See you, Bandy.
- Bye.

01:36:04.971 --> 01:36:07.235
Thanks, Bandy.

01:36:08.174 --> 01:36:09.971
- Bye.
- Hey, look.

01:36:44.110 --> 01:36:49.207
<i>If it weren't for Maps, who knows
if any of us would have ever come back.<i></i></i>

01:36:49.382 --> 01:36:51.509
<i>We could have gone on
thinking of the Cove...<i></i></i>

01:36:51.684 --> 01:36:54.050
<i>...like one of those old postcards...<i></i></i>

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.347
<i>...realer than real...<i></i></i>

01:36:56.523 --> 01:36:59.788
<i>...with each of us remembering it
however we chose.<i></i></i>

01:37:12.238 --> 01:37:16.038
<i>Coming back for the first time
after all these years...<i></i></i>

01:37:16.209 --> 01:37:22.148
<i>...fills me with a mixture of excitement
and the fear I made the whole thing up.<i></i></i>

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.984
<i>Believe it or not,
Maps did become a priest...<i></i></i>

01:37:32.158 --> 01:37:35.650
<i>...traveling to Africa
to help with the refugees.<i></i></i>

01:37:36.162 --> 01:37:41.099
<i>I got his letter just a few days
before his ashes arrived.<i></i></i>

01:37:45.405 --> 01:37:49.466
<i>He told me how often
he thought about this place...<i></i></i>

01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:54.974
<i>...and how happy he was
that we could share it together.<i></i></i>

01:37:55.281 --> 01:38:00.241
