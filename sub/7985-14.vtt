<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:02.169 --> 00:03.337
My biggest issue at this studio

00:03.337 --> 00:04.471
is your stupidity.

00:04.471 --> 00:05.806
You better get used to it, baby,

00:05.806 --> 00:06.907
'cause this is my studio.

00:06.907 --> 00:09.276
<i>Abby obviously brought Sarah in</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:10.544
<i>because JoJo</i>
<i>could not handle it.</i>

00:10.544 --> 00:12.980
My duet is going to...

00:12.980 --> 00:14.381
Maddie and Brynn.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.116
(whoops)

00:16.116 --> 00:18.285
JILL: <i>Maddie and Kendall have</i>
<i>been duet partners for years.</i>

00:18.285 --> 00:20.254
<i>I really wish Kendall</i>

ASHLEE:
<i>Is Mackenzie coming back</i>

00:21.688 --> 00:23.156
even though Maddie's
not coming back next year?

00:23.156 --> 00:25.859
I don't have any plans
leaving right now.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.261
<i>Us Weekly</i> is reporting

00:27.261 --> 00:30.097

00:31.999 --> 00:33.634
Hi.
I'm Sarah's mom.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.603
Kendall, you will be doing
a duet with Maddie.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.672
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:38.672 --> 00:40.107
Maddie's not gonna be here
tomorrow.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.341
So you want to take it away
from Kendall, then?

00:41.341 --> 00:43.977
<i>My daughter deserves better.</i>

00:43.977 --> 00:45.779
JESSALYNN: Honestly,
Maddie's getting so busy.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.247
We don't know
what your plans are.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.016
I think the kids
also have heard the rumors

00:49.016 --> 00:50.817
<i>Maddie might be leaving.</i>

00:50.817 --> 00:52.119
I don't want to sit
on a bench anymore.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.420
I'm tired of it,
to be honest with you.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.821
<i>There's more to the world</i>

Hi.

01:13.774 --> 01:14.875
What's up?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.710
Oh...
Not much.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.778
I'm Ashlee.
What was your name?

01:17.778 --> 01:19.446
Christy.
Christy, nice
to meet you.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.714
Nice to meet you, too.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.149
I didn't know we were
having somebody new.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.183
Yeah, well,

01:23.183 --> 01:24.651
I'm not too "new," though.

01:24.651 --> 01:25.953
You don't know who I am?

01:25.953 --> 01:27.321
Are you from...

01:27.321 --> 01:28.488
I'm from the
Pittsburgh studio.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.490
Oh, that's right.
Yeah!

01:30.490 --> 01:31.892
Okay, I recognize
you now.
I'm Sarah's mom.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.127
Sarah and I are from
the select team,

01:34.127 --> 01:36.330
<i>so we're trained by Abby.</i>

01:36.330 --> 01:37.864
<i>And she invited us</i>
<i>back on the team this week.</i>

01:37.864 --> 01:40.133
<i>She has been training so,</i>

01:40.133 --> 01:42.002
<i>so hard to prove to Abby</i>

01:42.002 --> 01:44.004
<i>that she can definitely be</i>
<i>a part of this team.</i>

01:44.004 --> 01:46.006
And she's gonna do a great job
no matter what's given to her.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.775
You got a pretty good position
here, don't you, huh?

01:48.775 --> 01:51.178
She likes Brynn,
but I'm not too popular,

01:51.178 --> 01:52.512
so it doesn't make it
fun for me.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.580
You're not? No?

01:53.580 --> 01:54.715
(laughing):
No, I'm not.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.183
The moms giving you a hard time?

01:56.183 --> 01:58.685
You know, we were called
because Maddie was gone.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.388
Mm‐hmm.
And Abby needed
someone to replace...

02:01.388 --> 02:03.156
Yeah, but see, that's, like,
what gets me, though.

02:03.156 --> 02:06.159
I don't understand why she
just doesn't revert back

02:06.159 --> 02:09.029
to who she knows,
and who she has trained.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.164
So, from my standpoint,

02:11.164 --> 02:13.433
you have to understand, like,
I agree with the other moms.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.035
I don't know.
She's just excited
to be here.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.771
I just think if you're
really fighting for a spot,

02:17.771 --> 02:20.040
Brynn's is probably not
the one you're gonna get.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.043
Because we're permanent
members as of two weeks ago.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.378
Yeah, but that could...

02:24.378 --> 02:27.514
Your jacket can be taken away
from you <i>quickly.</i>

02:27.514 --> 02:28.849
We'll have to see.

02:28.849 --> 02:29.850
MELISSA:
Hi, sweetheart!

02:29.850 --> 02:31.485
CHRISTY:
Oh, hi, miss, how are you?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.120
So nice to see you,
home from home!

02:33.120 --> 02:34.821
CHRISTY:
Good to see you, too, honey.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.390
Thanks for all
your text messages and...
Oh.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.158
all the time.
Absolutely.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.326
MELISSA:
<i>It's really great</i>
<i>to see Christy.</i>

02:39.326 --> 02:41.662
<i>I'm so happy that she's back.</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:43.230
I don't want
to say she's changed,

02:43.230 --> 02:44.831
but she's changed her ways.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.700
<i>I love her now.</i>

02:46.700 --> 02:47.668
Hi!
It's nice to see you!

02:47.668 --> 02:48.669
It's good to be here.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.470
I'm glad you're here!

02:50.470 --> 02:52.239
JILL:
That's great!

02:52.239 --> 02:54.007
Yay! (laughs)

02:54.007 --> 02:56.576
JESSALYNN:
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

02:56.576 --> 02:58.111
I don't like
anything about Christ‐y.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.279
<i>She thinks her daughter</i>

02:59.279 --> 03:00.614
<i>is so much better than JoJo.</i>

03:00.614 --> 03:01.515
Why are you even here?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.683
You're gonna be gone
in 24 hours,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.117
I have nothing
to worry about.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.720
Soon as JoJo takes
that stage... (pops)

03:08.288 --> 03:09.389
See ya later!

03:09.389 --> 03:11.258
She just drives me crazy.

03:12.492 --> 03:13.894
JILL:
Oh, yay!

03:13.894 --> 03:15.595
Abby!
ABBY LEE:
Oh!

03:15.595 --> 03:17.230
Hi!

03:17.230 --> 03:20.200
Can I get a hug?
So good to see
a smiling face out here!

03:20.200 --> 03:21.334
How you doin'?
How are you?

03:21.334 --> 03:22.502
I'm good.
Good, good, good, good.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.970
You look so pretty.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.005
Oh, well, thank you.
So do you.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.073
Thank you for
having us come out.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.140
No problem.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.742
Kalani isn't here this week.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.744
<i>She went home with her mom</i>

03:30.744 --> 03:33.513
<i>to attend her</i>
<i>great‐grandfather's funeral.</i>

03:33.513 --> 03:35.749
Perfect opportunity
for Sarah to step in.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.952
<i>She's improved, she's grown,</i>
<i>she's matured.</i>

03:38.952 --> 03:40.620
<i>She's a nice kid.</i>

03:40.620 --> 03:42.255
The kid's hungry, she wants it.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.691
<i>So I'm gonna give her</i>
<i>another try.</i>

03:44.691 --> 03:46.560
Okay.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.495
Welcome, Christy.

03:48.495 --> 03:49.930
Thank you.
ABBY LEE:
Sarah.

03:49.930 --> 03:50.931
CHRISTY:
Thank you for having us.

03:50.931 --> 03:51.932
Let's get to pyramid quickly.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.500
We were in Las Vegas, Nevada,

03:53.500 --> 03:54.901
this past weekend.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.169
Congratulations.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.337
<i>We did a David Bowie number</i>

03:57.337 --> 03:58.672
<i>and the group won.</i>

04:01.908 --> 04:04.311
Now, on the bottom of
the pyramid, we have Kalani.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.512
She's not here.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.348
Next, we have Mackenzie.

04:08.348 --> 04:12.252
In class, I don't remember
yelling at you about your feet.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.054
On stage...

04:14.054 --> 04:15.789
you're thinking about the face
and the choreography

04:15.789 --> 04:17.257
and the musicality...

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
that's just, like,
the first thing to go,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.061
is the feet.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.797
Next, we have JoJo.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.334
Nice job in the group,
no problems, fine.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.337
Next, we have Kendall.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.139
Kendall, you got through the
whole day without a breakdown.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.306
Pretty good.

04:33.306 --> 04:36.476
Next, we have Maddie.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.448
You really wanted to hold onto
that can of silly spray.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.450
It was all about you
getting out the last drop.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.886
(laughter)
Oh, no!

04:49.790 --> 04:52.626
Next, we have Nia.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.528
I didn't see
a stellar performance...

04:54.528 --> 04:56.797
I didn't see any mistakes.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.066
<i>You were just</i>
<i>middle of the road.</i>

05:00.066 --> 05:03.870
And, on top, our winner!

05:03.870 --> 05:05.872
(cheering)

05:05.872 --> 05:09.643
<i>Congratulations</i>
<i>on your first place solo win.</i>

05:11.511 --> 05:15.515
This weekend, we'll be at

05:15.515 --> 05:18.218
New York Dance Experience
in Long Beach.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.790
Now, local competition.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.425
So you need to be so good,

05:25.425 --> 05:27.427
and so amazing,

05:27.427 --> 05:29.529
that every one of those people
say "You know what?

05:29.529 --> 05:31.665
"Maybe it's time
for our child to come

05:31.665 --> 05:33.667
and train here at the ALDC LA."

05:33.667 --> 05:36.903
We all went, except for Sarah,

05:36.903 --> 05:38.939
to Las Vegas.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.640
Who had a good time?

05:42.409 --> 05:45.478
Oh, my God, Abby's grin
just went from here to here!

05:45.478 --> 05:47.013
JILL:
<i>Abby's had this glow about her</i>

05:47.013 --> 05:48.515
ever since Vegas.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.084
<i>She had a really wild time</i>

05:51.084 --> 05:52.452
<i>with a really hot guy.</i>

05:52.452 --> 05:54.855
<i>She has nicknamed him</i>
<i>"Magic Mike."</i>

05:54.855 --> 05:56.223
I'm just saying.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.557
ABBY LEE:
You don't go to Las Vegas

05:57.557 --> 05:58.792
without seeing a show.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.828
We saw the Michael Jackson
"One" show.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.131
I was inspired.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.133
So, this week,

06:07.133 --> 06:09.970
we have a Michael Jackson theme.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.172
(cheering)
Awesome.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.942
People don't understand
that the glove

06:15.942 --> 06:18.378
was a symbol
for Michael Jackson.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.314
The glove was a baseball glove.

06:21.314 --> 06:25.552
Michael Jackson's favorite thing
was baseball.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.953
You're doing a baseball dance.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.455
(cheering)

06:28.455 --> 06:30.123
HOLLY:
<i>The group dance this week,</i>

06:30.123 --> 06:31.858
<i>it has a baseball theme,</i>

06:31.858 --> 06:34.094
and it's all about
Michael Jackson having this

06:34.094 --> 06:35.295
<i>love of baseball.</i>

06:35.295 --> 06:36.296
<i>I never saw a baseball player</i>

06:36.296 --> 06:38.598
<i>with a rhinestone glove.</i>

06:38.598 --> 06:39.866
I'm so gonna research that.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.167
I really don't know
if that's true.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.535
Brynn!

06:42.535 --> 06:45.505
You're doing a duet...

06:45.505 --> 06:46.740
with Sarah.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.241
(cheering)

06:50.010 --> 06:51.244
ABBY LEE:
<i>This is Sarah's chance</i>

06:51.244 --> 06:53.280
<i>to show me what she's made of.</i>

06:53.280 --> 06:55.382
<i>If she's flawless,</i>

06:55.382 --> 06:56.583
who knows?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.985
Maybe I'll keep Sarah
and Christ‐y here.

06:58.985 --> 07:02.255
Last, but certainly not least,
Kendall.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.857
You're doing a duet with Maddie.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.892
Yeah!
Yeah!

07:08.795 --> 07:10.363
Abby, I don't want‐‐
mean to interrupt,

07:10.363 --> 07:11.564
but Maddie's not gonna
be here tomorrow.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.334
Maddie's not gonna be here.

07:14.334 --> 07:17.504
It's the Disney
60th Anniversary special,

07:17.504 --> 07:21.341
and Maddie is the only minor
in the entire show.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.010
JILL:
Oh, how fun, yeah.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.379
Is that fair
to the duet partner?

07:26.379 --> 07:27.547
MELISSA:
She's missing one day.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.615
Maddie could've been
in two other dances

07:28.615 --> 07:29.816
for the Disney thing,

07:29.816 --> 07:31.918
but I only chose one,
so she could be here.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.487
But I think Maddie
can handle it.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.090
KENDALL: <i>I'm really happy</i>
<i>that Maddie and I have a duet,</i>

07:37.090 --> 07:39.359
and I know that a lot is
happening in her life right now,

07:39.359 --> 07:41.528
<i>but this might be</i>
<i>our last duet together.</i>

07:41.528 --> 07:43.630
<i>She's my main duet partner.</i>

07:43.630 --> 07:46.733
<i>I've had duets with her ever</i>
<i>since I came to this studio,</i>

07:46.733 --> 07:48.068
<i>and I hope this one's good.</i>

07:48.068 --> 07:49.502
We have a lot of work to do.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.837
So, moms, go ahead and go.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.238
Guys, spread apart.

07:52.238 --> 07:55.008
All right, so,
the group routine.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.544

34:11.616 --> 34:13.084
<i>There is going to be</i>

34:13.084 --> 34:15.220
a lot of stiff competition.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.555
ALL:
We are Abby Lee!

34:16.555 --> 34:18.557
(whooping)

34:18.557 --> 34:20.158
ABBY LEE:
Let's do it.

34:20.158 --> 34:22.694
But there's also going to be
a lot of potential customers.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.196
<i>Nothing brings in students</i>
<i>like a winning team.</i>

34:25.196 --> 34:28.366
<i>So Sarah has a tough job today.</i>

34:28.366 --> 34:31.403
<i>She is not used to dancing</i>
<i>with this group.</i>

34:31.403 --> 34:33.038
<i>This is resting</i>
<i>on your shoulders, kiddo.</i>

34:33.038 --> 34:36.441
ANNOUNCER: Up next, taking
the stage is "Club 42."

34:36.441 --> 34:38.443
ALL:
Play ball!

34:38.443 --> 34:39.477
(audience cheers)

34:39.477 --> 34:40.879
(whooping)

34:46.017 --> 34:47.686
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

34:47.686 --> 34:50.422
All right, the top
junior duet/trio...

34:50.422 --> 34:52.023
SARAH: <i>Me and Brynn</i>
<i>really want to win.</i>

34:52.023 --> 34:53.291
MELISSA:
Why do we have to do this?

34:53.291 --> 34:54.793
Just say the girls
all did great.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.628
Well, we all know you're leaving
anyway, so don't worry about it.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.096
Melissa, anything to say?

35:04.135 --> 35:07.172
ANNOUNCER:

36:55.447 --> 36:57.148
Wow.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.250
Judges, what do you have to say?

36:59.250 --> 37:00.852
JUDGE: I loved it.
I love the concept.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.787
You look pretty,
yet you're tough.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.789
Sarah, I felt you lost

37:04.789 --> 37:06.357
a little bit at
the beginning on the turning.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.193
It just drew my focus
'cause you were on the end.

37:08.193 --> 37:10.562
You have a lot
to live up to, right?

37:10.562 --> 37:12.997
We all have to work to
the highest level of our group.

37:12.997 --> 37:14.332
Thank you.

37:14.332 --> 37:15.633
JUDGE 2:
Great job.

37:15.633 --> 37:16.935
I love this idea.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.037
And the aerial, like,
there's no aerial in baseball,

37:19.037 --> 37:20.772
but you did it.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.040
I love it, I love it.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.508
Brilliant performance,
brilliant.

37:23.508 --> 37:24.843
Thank you.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.545
ABBY LEE:
<i>I thought the judges' critiques</i>

37:27.545 --> 37:28.780
<i>were both good and bad.</i>

37:28.780 --> 37:30.115
<i>It could go either way.</i>

37:30.115 --> 37:33.351
<i>But more importantly,</i>
<i>at this competition,</i>

37:33.351 --> 37:35.353
they just have
one overall award.

37:35.353 --> 37:36.855
We have one chance to win.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.290
ANNOUNCER:
Who's ready for some awards?

37:39.290 --> 37:42.494
(cheering, whooping)

37:42.494 --> 37:45.029
Junior solos.

37:45.029 --> 37:46.297
In third place...

37:49.467 --> 37:51.970
..."Oh, Darling," Miss Amanda
from Pam Rossi's Dance Ten.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.539
JESSALYNN: <i>It is so important</i>
<i>for JoJo to win today</i>

37:54.539 --> 37:57.142
<i>because getting</i>
<i>this solo caused</i>

37:57.142 --> 37:59.110
<i>all this drama with the moms.</i>

37:59.110 --> 38:01.179
I mean, if JoJo isn't
feeling the pressure,

38:01.179 --> 38:02.647
I would be shocked.

38:02.647 --> 38:05.250
In second place...

38:07.819 --> 38:12.090
..."Walking Papers," that's
Emma from Touch of Class.

38:12.090 --> 38:16.194
And our first place
junior solo today...

38:20.098 --> 38:22.634
..."Cold Hearted,"
Emma from Touch of Class.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.269
(whooping)

38:27.105 --> 38:28.873
Give it up for Emma,
our top junior soloist today.

38:28.873 --> 38:32.177
I thought that
JoJo would be the one

38:32.177 --> 38:34.045
<i>to stand out</i>
<i>at this competition,</i>

38:34.045 --> 38:36.047
<i>but the judges wanted more.</i>

38:36.047 --> 38:37.315
<i>I guess, in their eyes,</i>

38:37.315 --> 38:39.717
she failed to bring
Michael Jackson to life.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.788
All right, the top
junior duet/trio...

38:43.788 --> 38:45.957
SARAH: <i>Me and Brynn</i>
<i>really want to win,</i>

38:45.957 --> 38:47.325
<i>so I'm crossing my fingers</i>

38:47.325 --> 38:48.993
that we do well.

38:48.993 --> 38:52.230
<i>I just feel like, because</i>
<i>I have been dancing for Abby</i>

38:52.230 --> 38:54.232
for three and a half years,

38:54.232 --> 38:56.367
<i>that I kind of should be,</i>
<i>like, a permanent member.</i>

38:56.367 --> 38:58.636
I want to, like, really badly.
(chuckles)

39:01.806 --> 39:04.108
... put your hands together
for Sarah and Brynn,

39:04.108 --> 39:05.710
Abby Lee Dance Company!

39:05.710 --> 39:09.714
CHRISTY: <i>I am so excited</i>
<i>that Brynn and Sarah won.</i>

39:09.714 --> 39:12.617
<i>She proved exactly</i>
<i>what she came here to do.</i>

39:12.617 --> 39:15.854
So, yeah, if Sarah is invited,

39:15.854 --> 39:20.291
<i>if she's welcomed,</i>
<i>by all means, we are here 100%.</i>

39:20.291 --> 39:23.361
Your top junior group today...

39:25.063 --> 39:27.732
JILL: <i>You know what,</i>
<i>we didn't have a great week.</i>

39:27.732 --> 39:30.034
<i>I know that there is</i>
<i>a lot of talk</i>

39:30.034 --> 39:32.370
of Melissa pulling
her kids from the team

39:32.370 --> 39:34.138
to go off and do other things.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.407
<i>I think our kids are confused.</i>

39:36.407 --> 39:38.109
<i>We're confused.</i>

39:38.109 --> 39:39.444
<i>Sarah's a good little dancer.</i>

39:39.444 --> 39:42.780
<i>But the ALDC has been</i>
<i>a revolving door.</i>

39:42.780 --> 39:46.651
<i>I think this will affect</i>
<i>the outcome of the group.</i>

39:46.651 --> 39:47.986
<i>I do.</i>

39:49.854 --> 39:51.856
...please put
your hands together...

39:54.292 --> 39:58.563
..."Five in Time,"
Touch of Class!

39:58.563 --> 40:00.398
(whooping)

40:01.766 --> 40:04.269
Top junior group,
take a bow.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.236
They blew it.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.138
<i>I want champions on this team,</i>

40:07.138 --> 40:09.073
<i>not losers.</i>

40:11.175 --> 40:13.544
ABBY LEE:
<i>What happened with our group?</i>

40:13.544 --> 40:14.679
MELISSA:
They didn't even place.

40:14.679 --> 40:17.015
You know what, our kids need
to work harder.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.117
They need to be better.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.152
I thought it was interesting
though that the judges

40:21.152 --> 40:23.288
specifically said
that Sarah was the one

40:23.288 --> 40:25.023
who stood out on the side,
JESSALYNN: Yeah, yeah.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.891
and so I thought, "Maybe that
kid really was just stressed."

40:26.891 --> 40:28.526
Maybe she really just felt

40:28.526 --> 40:30.094
this‐this was just
too much pressure for her.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.562
Maybe.

40:31.562 --> 40:36.000
I think Sarah was a beat behind
in the entire number.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.337
She hasn't danced with this
group in, what, a yea...?

40:39.337 --> 40:41.906
I mean, how long, right?
Obviously.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.575
ASHLEE:
When Brynn go there,

40:44.575 --> 40:45.944
she blended right in
from the first dance.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.412
CHRISTY: Good! Great.
She was never
called out for not...

40:47.412 --> 40:48.513
Congratulations. Good job.
ASHLEE: I'm just saying.

40:48.513 --> 40:49.647
Good job.
That's what you have to do

40:49.647 --> 40:51.149
in order to make it here.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.351
You've got to walk on and be
able to handle the pressure.

40:53.351 --> 40:57.355
You're not gonna put the team
loss on Sarah's shoulders.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.557
I mean, that's ridiculous.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.459
She, like,
second‐guesses herself.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.294
Do you know what I'm saying?

41:03.294 --> 41:05.630
Like, she waits for Mackenzie
or Maddie's arms to go up,

41:05.630 --> 41:06.631
and then hers are up.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.801
It's almost like
she doubts herself.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.104
Sarah is not "the quicker
picker‐upper."

41:13.104 --> 41:14.339
She is not.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.341
<i>It takes her weeks and weeks</i>

41:16.341 --> 41:18.409
<i>to get the choreography</i>
<i>into her body.</i>

41:18.409 --> 41:20.712
<i>We don't have weeks and weeks.</i>

41:20.712 --> 41:24.582
<i>That kid needs to continue to</i>
<i>improve and continue to learn.</i>

41:24.582 --> 41:26.284
<i>She's not ready to dance</i>
<i>with the big girls.</i>

41:26.284 --> 41:27.885
MELISSA:
Why do we have to do this?

41:27.885 --> 41:29.420
Just say the girls
all did great.

41:29.420 --> 41:32.056
All the girls were fabulous.

41:32.056 --> 41:33.725
Well, we all know you're leaving
anyway, so don't worry about it.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.896
Melissa, anything to say?

41:38.896 --> 41:40.665
MELISSA:
Uh‐uh, no, I won't speak.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.834
'Cause I don't really
need to anymore.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.737
JESSALYNN:
Do your kids know your plans?

41:45.737 --> 41:47.438
Or anything?

41:47.438 --> 41:49.107
No. Nobody knows anything.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.308
Nobody knows anything.

41:50.308 --> 41:53.177
(laughs)

41:54.912 --> 41:56.647
ABBY LEE: <i>The group routine</i>
<i>this week is inspired</i>

41:56.647 --> 42:01.152
