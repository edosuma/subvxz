A large single malt. On the house.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.380
Yes, Mr Cranage.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.420
To thank you for your help
with the licence.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.299
I really didn't do anything.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.900
Nonetheless, I always like to stay
on the right side of the law.

00:51.658 --> 00:53.338
Where did you get him?

00:54.421 --> 00:55.748
The gutter.

00:55.773 --> 00:58.303
We're home to all sorts of waifs

I don't have anyone else to turn to.

Please... Yes.

And may God forgive us... both.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.700
Now, another slice?
No, no.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.300
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father.

03:53.340 --> 03:55.500
My godmother writes about you
so fondly.

03:55.540 --> 03:57.379
Don't you believe a word of it.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.620
Now, we mustn't forget
to telephone your parents,

03:59.660 --> 04:02.780
let them know you've arrived safely.
You can't. They're...

04:02.820 --> 04:04.419
They're on a walking holiday.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.700
The Brecon Beacons, I believe.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.260
I couldn't even tell you
where they're staying.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.020
So what made you decide
to come and visit your godmother?

04:13.060 --> 04:15.620
And why shouldn't she decide
to visit her godmother?

04:15.660 --> 04:17.899
Well, when the cat's away...

04:17.899 --> 04:21.940
You believe I should be at home
throwing wild parties?

04:21.980 --> 04:25.579
Well, I'm not encouraging it, but...
I'd rather be here.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.740
I haven't spent any time
with my godmother in years.

04:28.780 --> 04:32.100
Will you excuse me one moment?

04:37.580 --> 04:41.060
All right, then, spit it out.
Well...

04:42.260 --> 04:44.380
..turning up out of the blue
like this...

04:44.420 --> 04:47.579
Well, her letter
probably went astray in the post.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.379
You don't think
there's anything wrong?

04:49.380 --> 04:50.980
A row with her parents, perhaps?

04:51.020 --> 04:53.420
If there was anything wrong,
she'd tell me.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.939
We've always been very close.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.540
Cooo-ee!

04:58.020 --> 05:00.100
Hello!
And what are you doing here?

05:00.140 --> 05:01.419
Charming!

05:01.420 --> 05:04.980
I thought I'd bring these along
for your charity auction next week.

05:05.020 --> 05:08.220
When I heard about those poor little
mites suffering from polio,

05:08.260 --> 05:10.860
I thought,
what a fantastic opportunity for me

05:10.900 --> 05:12.300
to clear out my wardrobe.

05:12.340 --> 05:15.260
Well, thank you very much
for your donation, Penelope.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.980
Now, there's something
I have to say.

05:17.020 --> 05:20.060
My goddaughter Joselyn
is staying here for a few days

05:20.100 --> 05:22.779
and I do not want her subjected
to your bad influence.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.300
Bad influence?!

05:24.340 --> 05:27.739
Mrs M, I would never attempt

05:27.740 --> 05:29.780
to drag an innocent down the path
of temptation.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.659
Talk of the devil.
You must be Joselyn.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.499
Hello, I'm Bunty.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.500
What a darling little thing you are.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.740
Thank you. I love your hat.

05:40.780 --> 05:44.459
Oh, well, you're welcome
to borrow it any time you like.

05:44.460 --> 05:47.739
You should wear it
to one of my soirees.

05:47.740 --> 05:52.340
Music, cocktails,
an array of unsuitable bachelors...

05:52.380 --> 05:54.779
Oh, that's very kind, but I...

05:54.780 --> 05:56.459
Penelope, you have been warned.

05:56.460 --> 05:59.140
Now, I'm going to help you unpack.

05:59.180 --> 06:01.260
Lovely to meet you.
Mm.

06:03.220 --> 06:04.740
Hm... well.

06:06.180 --> 06:10.220
That girl is not nearly as innocent
as she's pretending to be.

06:11.460 --> 06:13.540
I suspect you might be right.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.340
Is that it?

06:21.380 --> 06:22.620
A slow night.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.380
See you tomorrow, V.

06:36.420 --> 06:38.020
Well?

06:40.540 --> 06:42.300
I take it you're feeling better?

06:42.340 --> 06:44.740
Yes. Thank you.

06:45.940 --> 06:47.939
So, if I lend you this money,

06:47.940 --> 06:49.620
there'll be no more
missed appointments?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.060
No.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
Excellent.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.740
You can add it to
what you already owe me.

07:03.860 --> 07:06.260
You're going to be a very busy girl.

07:08.940 --> 07:11.140
Say thank you to your Uncle Maurice.

07:13.020 --> 07:14.180
Thank you.

07:25.980 --> 07:27.980
You can go, Janek. I'll lock up.

08:13.940 --> 08:16.140
Good morning!

08:16.180 --> 08:18.180
Rise and shine!

08:34.260 --> 08:36.059
Nothing we can do.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.900
What do you mean,
"nothing we can do"?

08:38.940 --> 08:41.940
She's an adult.
Well, what about the letter?

08:41.980 --> 08:45.619
In which she states, "You shouldn't
expect to see me again."

08:45.620 --> 08:49.059
Sounds like she's running away.
Exactly! So...

08:49.060 --> 08:51.420
Which she's perfectly
entitled to do.

08:53.220 --> 08:55.980
And what about this?

08:56.020 --> 08:58.739
I found it on the floor
of her bedroom.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.820
Well, that changes everything.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.780
I'll put all my men on red alert.

09:03.820 --> 09:07.700
We're clearly looking for a parrot
with a penchant for kidnap!

09:10.460 --> 09:12.340
Perhaps you could help, Padre?

09:12.380 --> 09:15.860
You like wild goose chases,
so this'll be right up your street.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.460
Come along, Sergeant.

09:20.780 --> 09:24.180
Don't you worry, Mrs McCarthy.
I'll keep an eye out for her.

09:32.260 --> 09:35.579
Did you speak to her parents?
They're on holiday.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.380
At least that part was true.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.300
According to the housekeeper,

09:39.340 --> 09:42.180
Joselyn stayed behind
to attend secretarial classes.

09:42.220 --> 09:45.059
Did the housekeeper say
where the classes were held?

09:45.060 --> 09:46.940
She didn't know.

09:46.980 --> 09:50.619
Only that Joselyn has been going
for three or four evenings a week

09:50.620 --> 09:52.099
for the past few months.

09:52.100 --> 09:55.339
And that sometimes
she stays over with a friend,

09:55.340 --> 09:57.940
but the housekeeper
couldn't give me a name.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.780
There is one place
that springs to mind.

10:02.220 --> 10:04.620
Not that I'd call the girls
"secretaries" exactly.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.700
I met a girl at a party
who used to work here.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.739
They make them wear red feathers
in their hair.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.980
And very little else,
I shouldn't wonder!

10:16.020 --> 10:19.059
My Joselyn wouldn't be seen dead
in a place like this.

10:19.060 --> 10:21.099
Let's not tempt fate.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.300
Well, it has to be worth
checking out?

10:23.340 --> 10:24.980
And how are you going to do that?

10:27.820 --> 10:29.900
You are not suggesting...

10:29.940 --> 10:32.179
that Father Brown signs up
for membership?!

10:32.180 --> 10:34.460
I doubt the Bishop would approve.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.340
Oh, you could just pretend to be
a concerned relative

10:37.380 --> 10:39.219
and then ask
if Joselyn works here.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.580
Well, that assumes
she's using her own name.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.620
As far as I understand, the...

10:43.660 --> 10:46.819
ladies who work in these
establishments use noms de plume.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.260
How do you know that?

10:48.300 --> 10:51.100
The things I've heard
in confession...

10:51.140 --> 10:53.379
would make a sailor blush.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.019
Oh, my God...!

10:55.020 --> 10:56.620
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.780
DOORBELL RINGS

11:02.860 --> 11:05.500
I take it you, er...
have experience?

11:05.540 --> 11:08.180
More than you
could possibly imagine.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.979
What sort of act do you do?

11:09.980 --> 11:11.500
What sort of act would you like?

11:11.540 --> 11:15.700
Well, we've got a couple of singers
and a few straight burlesque acts.

11:15.740 --> 11:18.060
I could use something
a bit different.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.500
I can do... different.

11:21.260 --> 11:24.260
I'd need to see it,
before I book you in.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.300
Naturally.

11:27.340 --> 11:29.500
I just need to gather
a few... props.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.699
♪ C'est si bon

11:39.700 --> 11:43.019
♪ Lovers say that in France

11:43.020 --> 11:45.380
♪ When they thrill to romance

11:45.420 --> 11:48.820
♪ It means that it's so good

12:00.140 --> 12:02.780
♪ Because it's oh so good. ♪

12:04.900 --> 12:07.700
Why have you stopped?
Want to see more, darling?

12:07.740 --> 12:11.260
Well, I get my own dressing room,

12:11.300 --> 12:15.259
two nights off a week and...

12:15.260 --> 12:17.740
Ah!
Twice what the other girls earn.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.900
Wait a minute!

12:21.380 --> 12:22.940
Scarlet, get out here!

12:22.980 --> 12:26.220
Show our new employee
to her dressing room three.

12:26.260 --> 12:28.420
Welcome to The Crimson Feather.

12:33.740 --> 12:35.340
Hello... Scarlet.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.099
Well, I never!

12:43.100 --> 12:44.659
Do you know her?

12:44.660 --> 12:48.340
She used to work for Mrs Curzon,
until she was fired for stealing.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.180
They're obviously not too choosy
about who they employ here.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.899
Thanks for that, Father.
Good news or bad news?

13:00.900 --> 13:04.980
This is no time for playing games!
Is she in there or is she not?

13:05.020 --> 13:07.220
She is.
Oh, thank God for that.

13:07.260 --> 13:10.099
But she doesn't want to leave.
Why not?

13:10.100 --> 13:13.820
Because she's earning over ten times
what she'd earn as a secretary.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.380
She's sick of people telling her
what to do.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.980
And to be fair,
she looks fabulous in sequins.

13:19.020 --> 13:22.899
Well, I will go in and drag her out
by the ears, if I have to!

13:22.900 --> 13:25.380
Mrs McCarthy...
perhaps I should deal with this.

13:26.420 --> 13:29.500
But you can't go in there, Father!
What with all the.... Don't worry.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.100
I will avert my eyes.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.740
A family member
asked me to speak to her.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.979
I'm sorry, Father. I'm not
in the habit of letting random men

13:46.980 --> 13:50.180
into my girls' dressing rooms.
Not even a priest.

13:50.220 --> 13:53.340
Now, we're about to open,
so if that's all...

13:53.380 --> 13:55.620
Very well.
Thank you for your time, Mr Cranage.

13:57.820 --> 14:01.660
I'll wait outside the front door,
until she finally finishes.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.260
Ah...

14:03.300 --> 14:06.540
I'm sure I can make an exception
for a man of the cloth.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.100
Come with me.

14:10.820 --> 14:14.140
Scarlet's one of our newer girls.
Getting on very well.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.876
But then, I always like to make sure
all my employees are happy here.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.140
Don't I, girls?

14:23.980 --> 14:25.620
Janet.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.539
This is her, Father.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.460
Scarlet?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.020
What have you done?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.099
It was not me! I did not do this!

14:38.100 --> 14:39.380
Janek?

14:41.100 --> 14:45.180
I think, perhaps, you should call
the police and a doctor.

14:56.140 --> 14:57.739
Joselyn?

14:57.740 --> 15:00.140
Joselyn... can you hear me?

15:06.820 --> 15:08.100
Verity!

15:08.140 --> 15:09.700
Is she dead?

15:11.780 --> 15:14.339
Why is she wearing your costume?

15:14.340 --> 15:16.580
I... I asked her to go on for me.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.220
My head was in such a spin after...

15:21.140 --> 15:23.940
I need you all to clear this room
immediately.

15:28.380 --> 15:30.420
I just happened to be passing.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.740
Any news on Janek?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.580
The police are still hunting him.

15:43.260 --> 15:45.060
It just doesn't make any sense.

15:45.100 --> 15:49.340
I mean, I know he looks tough,
but he was so... protective.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.540
I agree.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.540
He was a regular at mass.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.820
I always thought him... a good man.

15:55.860 --> 15:58.539
"Good"?
Working in a place like that?

15:58.540 --> 16:01.900
What if Verity was already dead when
he found her? Then why would he run?

16:01.940 --> 16:04.780
Because he knew some people
would jump to conclusions.

16:04.820 --> 16:09.020
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
that it was someone else.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.100
Joselyn, you said that Verity
was wearing your costume.

16:12.140 --> 16:16.140
Yes. It threw me,
Bunty turning up like that.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.380
I couldn't face going on.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.620
Is it possible
the killer was after you?

16:21.660 --> 16:23.620
Hm, I can't think why.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.700
And Verity...

16:25.740 --> 16:27.940
would anyone have a reason
to kill her?

16:30.020 --> 16:31.380
Well...

16:33.980 --> 16:38.620
..a while ago,
Maurice asked if I'd like to earn...

16:38.660 --> 16:40.459
some extra money.

16:40.460 --> 16:43.220
There was something unpleasant
about how he came out with it,

16:43.260 --> 16:45.380
so I said no.

16:45.420 --> 16:48.300
Maybe he's up to no good
and Verity got involved?

16:48.340 --> 16:51.060
Who wouldn't want to kill her?
She was vile to everyone.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.300
Fifi! Well, it's true.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.740
I mean, when I first started,

16:55.780 --> 16:57.780
she was as nice as anything,
but recently...

17:00.020 --> 17:03.260
I saw her arguing with Oscar
yesterday.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.300
Don't drag Oscar into it.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

17:06.339 --> 17:07.740
What were you thinking?!

17:09.700 --> 17:12.220
Erm... Bunty, Fifi...?

17:24.020 --> 17:26.420
Degrading yourself
in a place like that

17:26.460 --> 17:29.860
and taking all your clothes off
in front of all those leering men!

17:29.900 --> 17:33.020
Have you no shame?
I'm sorry I lied to you.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.619
And so you should be,

17:34.620 --> 17:37.219
turning up at my door
and then vanishing into the night.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.340
What were you playing at?

17:39.380 --> 17:41.420
I wanted to see you one last time.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.660
Say goodbye, I suppose.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.700
You've always been so kind to me.

17:45.740 --> 17:47.100
Goodbye?

17:48.420 --> 17:51.260
I... was planning to catch
the early train to London.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.220
I thought I'd never see you again.

17:54.420 --> 17:56.260
To London?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.100
Do your parents know about this?

17:58.140 --> 18:02.180
They're the reason I'm leaving.
You don't know what they're like.

18:02.220 --> 18:06.340
I have known them for years.
They are good, kind people.

18:06.380 --> 18:10.700
They try to control everything I do.
They want me to be someone I'm not!

18:10.740 --> 18:14.700
Oh, so you told them you were
attending secretarial classes

18:14.740 --> 18:17.820
when, in fact,
you were getting yourself a job

18:17.860 --> 18:21.660
showing your bits
to... lecherous drunkards?

18:21.700 --> 18:24.700
Burlesque isn't only about
stripping. It's...

18:25.980 --> 18:27.340
It's artistic.

18:27.380 --> 18:30.819
Oh, well, now I've heard everything!

18:30.820 --> 18:32.220
I only got the job at the club

18:32.260 --> 18:34.539
because I needed the money
to start a new life.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.100
So... why are you still here?

18:39.980 --> 18:41.660
Cold feet.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.419
I made it to the platform,
but I couldn't board the train.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.900
I was too embarrassed to come back
here, so I went to the club.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.900
I never dreamed you'd find me there.

18:50.940 --> 18:54.179
I am thankful
that you were not foolish enough

18:54.180 --> 18:56.300
to see this ridiculous plan through!

18:57.860 --> 19:00.020
And I am very thankful...

19:00.060 --> 19:03.500
that it wasn't your body
lying on that floor!

19:12.900 --> 19:15.020
BELL RINGS

19:21.180 --> 19:22.300
Father?

19:24.060 --> 19:25.420
Janek.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.140
Haven't seen you at mass
for a while.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.180
I was ashamed.

19:33.780 --> 19:36.220
You see where I work, you know why.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.900
The police are looking for you.
I know.

19:43.780 --> 19:47.620
I wanted to make money to take back
to my family in Poland.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.820
Instead... I will hang.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.579
Only if you're guilty.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.180
I deserve it.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.099
What do you mean?

20:01.100 --> 20:03.100
Padre, are you in there?
I wanted to ask if...

20:05.420 --> 20:07.300
Well, well, well...

20:11.380 --> 20:13.780
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt, Padre,

20:13.820 --> 20:16.140
and assume you weren't harbouring
a wanted murderer.

20:16.180 --> 20:19.979
When we found him, he was trying
to stem the flow of blood.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.780
Doesn't mean he didn't stab her.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.740
Have you found the murder weapon?
It'll turn up.

20:25.780 --> 20:28.779
Either way, any jury would take
one look at that thug

20:28.780 --> 20:30.660
and sentence him to hang.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.580
I'll let you know
if you're needed as witnesses.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.579
Well, he certainly looked
guilty to me.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.060
Perhaps.

20:39.460 --> 20:41.299
But not of murder.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.060
We should go to the club.
Look for...

20:43.100 --> 20:44.980
Don't even think about it!

20:46.460 --> 20:49.740
Perhaps... your godmother is right.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.140
If the killer is still at large,
then...

20:53.380 --> 20:54.820
..you are still in danger.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.260
How about I go with her?

20:58.500 --> 21:01.900
As far as Maurice is concerned,
I'm still plain old Pepper Seymour.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.580
I think it suits me.

21:04.620 --> 21:07.700
And I can keep an eye
on the investigation.

21:07.740 --> 21:09.420
Well, if Joselyn's going, I'm going.

21:10.700 --> 21:14.220
Very well.
Then I will go to the station

21:14.260 --> 21:17.219
and talk to Janek
and get his side of things.

21:17.220 --> 21:19.580
You're not going to allow this?

21:19.620 --> 21:22.219
With respect, Auntie Bridget,
it's not his decision.

21:22.220 --> 21:26.100
I'll look after her, don't worry.
Forgive me if I'm not reassured!

21:26.140 --> 21:28.340
All right,
I will have to go with you.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.380
Oh, need help coming up with an act?

21:30.420 --> 21:32.420
Bunty's right.
Maurice isn't going to let you

21:32.460 --> 21:35.220
wander round his club
for no good reason.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.740
Do you know anyone
who needs a cleaner?

21:47.260 --> 21:51.060
As you can see, my references
include the Montague family.

21:51.100 --> 21:54.379
Which begs the question,
why do you want to work here.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.580
I need to talk to you.
Can't you see I'm busy?

21:57.620 --> 22:00.779
How could you open after
what's happened? Life goes on.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.260
You need to get yourself straight.
We've got customers.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.339
We already had to find
a replacement dancer.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.340
I don't want to have to find
a pianist, as well.

22:11.220 --> 22:13.660
And, you, you're in luck.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.660
The usual cleaner's
just handed in her notice.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.900
It's like somebody up there
is looking after you.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.780
Oh, well,
I suppose you could say that.

22:23.860 --> 22:27.460
I assume you've heard of the phrase
"caught red-handed"?

22:27.500 --> 22:29.660
Goodfellow, open cell two.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.940
What if he found her
and was trying to help her?

22:32.980 --> 22:35.019
Then how do you explain the money?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.580
When he was arrested, Father,

22:36.620 --> 22:38.620
they found an envelope
full of cash on him.

22:38.660 --> 22:41.299
And Verity's fingerprints
were all over it.

22:41.300 --> 22:43.099
So you think it was robbery?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.380
Exactly.

22:45.580 --> 22:49.780
Tell him to confess.
It'll make all our lives easier.

22:59.980 --> 23:04.500
Feel free to accidentally drop
the key down a drain.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.540
Nothing yet.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.660
I heard Oscar had to hurry back
from the States

23:20.700 --> 23:23.500
because he was in trouble
with the police.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.220
I'm going to look upstairs.

23:36.420 --> 23:38.140
Here you are...
Oh!

23:38.180 --> 23:39.980
Just look at this.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.020
I can't believe it.

23:43.980 --> 23:46.499
A man doing his own laundry?

23:46.500 --> 23:49.100
Come on, I've got a special job
for you. No...

23:50.300 --> 23:51.420
Quickly!

23:54.260 --> 23:56.979
Cough if you hear anyone coming.
And try and look busy.

23:56.980 --> 23:59.060
And what exactly will you be doing?

23:59.100 --> 24:01.700
Same as you. Checking for dirt.

24:06.420 --> 24:08.700
Oh, there must be a key
here somewhere.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.740
Got it!

24:27.140 --> 24:29.940
VOICES APPROACH

24:39.940 --> 24:42.139
Quick, in here!

24:42.140 --> 24:43.940

25:05.740 --> 25:07.859
Oh, you should be ashamed
of yourselves,

25:07.860 --> 25:10.739
sat there drinking and salivating.

25:10.740 --> 25:15.140
I have stockings that are older
than some of these girls!

25:16.580 --> 25:18.060
Oh, you think this is funny, do you?

25:18.100 --> 25:21.340
Well, I have a good mind
to take a broom handle

25:21.380 --> 25:23.060
to every last one of you!

25:23.100 --> 25:24.819

Verity was in trouble.

25:38.820 --> 25:40.380
I agreed to help.

25:41.860 --> 25:43.620
Ah... trouble.

25:44.940 --> 25:46.500
She was desperate.

25:46.540 --> 25:49.140
There is a woman on my street and...

25:49.180 --> 25:50.780
if you have the money...

25:52.020 --> 25:53.420
An abortion.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.100
Was the baby yours?

25:58.140 --> 26:00.140
No! No, we never...

26:02.300 --> 26:04.420
Then why did she come to you
for help?

26:05.660 --> 26:07.020
Because...

26:08.460 --> 26:11.460
..she knew I would give her
anything she wanted.

26:13.020 --> 26:14.700
Even my soul.

26:18.140 --> 26:19.820
Did she go through with it?

26:19.860 --> 26:21.020
No.

26:22.300 --> 26:25.100
I went to try one last time
to talk her out of it.

26:26.220 --> 26:29.180
That is when I found her.
I tried to stop the bleeding, but...

26:31.020 --> 26:34.420
Janek, you have to tell
the Inspector that you are innocent.

26:35.740 --> 26:37.100
But I am not.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.140
God knew what we were planning.

26:41.380 --> 26:43.820
He punished her and I shall be next.

26:48.300 --> 26:52.780
And what happened today
is never to be spoken of again.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.819
"I know what you've been up to
and I want a cut."

26:56.820 --> 26:58.620
I beg your pardon?

26:58.660 --> 27:01.899
A letter from Maurice's desk.
Anonymous.

27:01.900 --> 27:05.260
Tells him to leave money in
a storage cupboard under the stage.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.980
So Verity was blackmailing Maurice?

27:08.020 --> 27:10.499
It would explain
where the money came from.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.819
Perhaps Maurice killed her
to silence her?

27:12.820 --> 27:14.900
We should tell the Inspector.
Not yet.

27:16.020 --> 27:18.100
We can't prove
this comes from Verity.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.780
And we don't even know what
she was accusing Maurice of doing.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.260
If Verity was pregnant,

27:24.300 --> 27:27.060
surely we should be speaking
to the father?

27:28.700 --> 27:31.459
Well, that piano player.
Oscar?

27:31.460 --> 27:33.580
When I was at the club, I saw him...

27:33.620 --> 27:36.620
Oscar would never have...
Would you please let me finish?

27:36.660 --> 27:39.860
Finish accusing an innocent man?
You don't know anything about him!

27:42.940 --> 27:44.460
Sensitive subject?

27:56.780 --> 27:58.740
How long have you been seeing him?

28:04.060 --> 28:08.180
Is Oscar the "friend"
with whom you have occasionally

28:08.220 --> 28:11.340
been staying over with?

28:12.620 --> 28:14.180
It's been a few months.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.020
Since I started at the club.

28:19.420 --> 28:21.060
That night...

28:21.100 --> 28:24.340
when I disappeared
from Auntie Bridget's house,

28:24.380 --> 28:27.700
Oscar and I were supposed to be
meeting at Kembleford train station.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.420
We were planning to go to London
together.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.260
Only...

28:32.300 --> 28:34.340
Only, he never showed up.

28:36.140 --> 28:37.740
Do you know why?

28:37.780 --> 28:40.620
Erm... I thought something
must've happened to him.

28:40.660 --> 28:44.059
So you went back to the club
to find out what?

28:44.060 --> 28:46.700
When I got there,
he wouldn't even speak to me.

28:48.740 --> 28:50.779
I thought he loved me!

28:50.780 --> 28:53.900
SHE SOBS
Does anyone else know?

28:53.940 --> 28:58.060
Erm... only Fifi,
but she wouldn't tell anyone.

28:58.100 --> 29:01.100
You won't say anything
to Auntie Bridget, will you?

BICYCLE BELL JINGLES

29:15.580 --> 29:19.180
You're wasting your time.
I don't do religion.

29:19.220 --> 29:21.779
I'm not here to convert you.
I'm here to talk about Joselyn.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.820
What about her? You were planning
to go to London with her.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.580
And? What happened?

29:30.100 --> 29:32.419
Ask her.
Was it about Verity?

29:32.420 --> 29:35.020
Did you find out she was pregnant
and get cold feet?

29:35.060 --> 29:36.620
Verity was pregnant?

29:38.380 --> 29:39.979
Oh, I get it!

29:39.980 --> 29:42.540
You... You think I'm the father.

29:43.580 --> 29:44.780
Well, I wasn't.

29:44.820 --> 29:47.620
And it was Joselyn
that got cold feet, not me.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.940
Why?

29:48.980 --> 29:50.380
Oscar!

29:51.700 --> 29:53.460
I'm not paying you to smoke.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.699
Thank you for coming so quickly.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.620
How can I help?

30:12.980 --> 30:15.140
I wish to send a letter home.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.099
To say goodbye.

30:17.100 --> 30:20.740
Goodbye?
I have been charged... with murder.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.580
The Inspector thinks I... will hang
and...

30:26.140 --> 30:30.780
..I want to ask for forgiveness
from my family...

30:32.340 --> 30:33.540
..but I cannot write.

30:33.580 --> 30:34.979
I understand.

30:34.980 --> 30:39.020
But I'm afraid my Polish
is... straszne.

30:39.060 --> 30:41.099
English is fine.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.500
Our local priest,
he will translate.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.580
I will help, of course. But...

30:47.100 --> 30:49.859
..may I ask something in return?

30:49.860 --> 30:51.180
Anything.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.100
Maurice was being blackmailed.

30:59.500 --> 31:02.300
And I need to know by who and why.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.980
I don't know who, but...

31:07.260 --> 31:09.939
..Maurice had an arrangement
with some men.

31:09.940 --> 31:12.100
Erm, customers. Wealthy.

31:13.780 --> 31:18.620
Mr Cranage let them spend time
with one or two of the dancers.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.180
Prostitution?

31:21.860 --> 31:24.300
Was Verity one of them?

31:24.340 --> 31:27.140
Yes. But she would not blackmail
Mr Cranage.

31:27.180 --> 31:29.020
He had too much power over her.

31:30.460 --> 31:33.460
Now, please, the letter.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.020
You will write home.

31:36.140 --> 31:38.500
You will not say goodbye.

31:38.540 --> 31:40.539
I will not let you hang.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.620
It is in God's hands now.
Yes.

31:43.940 --> 31:45.420
Why do you think he sent me?

31:47.300 --> 31:49.300
'I've already caught the culprit.'

31:49.340 --> 31:50.740
So you say.

31:50.780 --> 31:54.180
But I saw that musician
scrubbing blood from his shirt.

31:55.620 --> 31:57.579
What if he made Verity pregnant,

31:57.580 --> 32:01.700
she was demanding money,
making a fuss, and so he killed her?

32:01.740 --> 32:04.180
The doorman was found on the scene.

32:04.220 --> 32:07.179
As were you... found on the scene.

32:07.180 --> 32:10.020
But we wouldn't want that
getting out, now would we?

32:10.900 --> 32:16.539
I am only asking you if you will
investigate this... pianist.

32:16.540 --> 32:18.380
KNOCKING
What now?!

32:21.620 --> 32:23.179
Ah...

32:23.180 --> 32:24.899
Mrs McCarthy.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.900
I didn't expect to see you here.

32:28.140 --> 32:31.740
I was just... You know exactly
what she's doing here, Padre.

32:31.780 --> 32:34.019
Doing your dirty work, as always!

32:34.020 --> 32:35.220
Fine.

32:36.340 --> 32:39.220
I'll bring him in for questioning.
But that's all I'm promising.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.779
Well, he was clearly involved.

32:44.780 --> 32:47.180
How else do you explain the blood
on his shirt?

32:47.220 --> 32:52.060
Maurice made him mop the floor
after Verity's body was removed.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.099
This is because we were
seeing each other, isn't it?

32:56.100 --> 32:58.380
Oh, you're worse than my parents.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.980
At least they wouldn't send
an innocent man to the scaffold

33:01.020 --> 33:02.820
just to keep him away from me!

33:02.860 --> 33:04.460
I am not going to pretend

33:04.500 --> 33:08.139
that I approve of you eloping with
a down-and-out musician.

33:08.140 --> 33:10.300
Oh, so it's his job you don't like?

33:10.340 --> 33:12.620
And here's me thinking
it's the colour of his skin!

33:14.060 --> 33:15.499
How could you think that?!

33:15.500 --> 33:18.099
If anything happens to him...

33:18.100 --> 33:20.300
I will never forgive you.

33:21.740 --> 33:24.180
Where're you going?
To warn him!

33:26.620 --> 33:28.980
Well, I was only trying
to protect her.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.420
I've made a terrible mistake,
haven't I?

33:38.420 --> 33:40.620
You're not intending to leave me
without a piano player

33:40.660 --> 33:42.420
at such short notice?

33:42.460 --> 33:44.339
Surely we can come
to some arrangement?

33:44.340 --> 33:46.539
This is a murder investigation.

33:46.540 --> 33:49.699
My customers are already
apprehensive about returning.

33:49.700 --> 33:52.980
We are not an establishment
that flourishes in the spotlight.

33:53.020 --> 33:55.259
We prefer the anonymity
of the shadows,

33:55.260 --> 33:56.940
as I'm sure you can understand.

33:58.180 --> 34:01.460
You're making a mistake!
I don't recall asking your opinion.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.900
Did you know Mr Cranage
is offering...

34:06.940 --> 34:09.938
extra services to his clients?

34:09.940 --> 34:12.978
Rubbish!
We are a respectable establishment.

34:12.980 --> 34:14.739
Enough!
You, stay out of it!

34:14.780 --> 34:16.540
Take me to Mr Bergeres immediately.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.179
Sergeant, with me.
Righty-oh, sir.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.340
I know somewhere you can hide.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.900
Inspector.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.219
We've found our murder weapon.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.420
Round up the other officers
and meet me downstairs.

34:59.460 --> 35:02.500
We've got a manhunt on our hands.
Righty-oh, sir.

35:02.540 --> 35:03.780
Quick!

35:07.180 --> 35:09.796
You know I had nothing to do with
Verity's death, right? Of course.

35:09.820 --> 35:10.860
Urgh!

35:49.220 --> 35:50.820
That's not my writing.

35:52.460 --> 35:55.900
Listen up. I want check-points
on all roads out of town

35:55.940 --> 35:58.019
and door-to-door searches.

35:58.020 --> 36:00.940
If you find him,
approach with caution.

36:00.980 --> 36:03.019
He tried to kill me!
Who?

36:03.020 --> 36:05.299
Oscar! I hit him. I wasn't thinking.

36:05.300 --> 36:07.899
I'm not going to get in trouble,
am I? Of course not.

36:07.900 --> 36:11.140
Where is he now? In the store-room
under the stage. I'll show you.

36:11.180 --> 36:13.260
Come with me.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.259
You mustn't blame yourself.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.500
None of us knew
he was capable of such...

36:38.780 --> 36:40.140
..evil.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.820
He isn't. I know he isn't.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.419
But...

36:44.420 --> 36:45.420
It's strange.

36:46.740 --> 36:51.540
Whoever wrote to Oscar cancelling
Joselyn's rendezvous with him

36:51.580 --> 36:54.780
had the same handwriting as whoever
was blackmailing Maurice.

36:54.820 --> 36:58.020
And I believe that
that person killed Verity.

36:58.060 --> 36:59.300
How awful!

36:59.340 --> 37:00.580
Who?

37:03.180 --> 37:04.180
Me?!

37:05.580 --> 37:09.900
You were convinced of
Janek's innocence from the start.

37:11.900 --> 37:15.140
And so keen to return to the club
to prove it.

37:16.580 --> 37:20.539
A perfect opportunity to retrieve
the shard you had hidden

37:20.540 --> 37:23.460
and use it to frame Oscar.

37:24.820 --> 37:27.580
You can't possibly think that I'd...

37:29.340 --> 37:30.859
Take off your gloves.

37:30.860 --> 37:32.180
What?

37:32.220 --> 37:36.340
When you first saw Verity's body,
you let out a cry of alarm.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.260
But only after Joselyn
had grabbed your hand.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.940
Ever since then,
you've kept your gloves on,

37:42.980 --> 37:45.180
even in this hot weather.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.500
So? I don't see how that's...

37:47.540 --> 37:49.500
Show me your hands.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.100
No.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.620
It was you!

38:02.060 --> 38:04.540
No!
You killed her!

38:04.580 --> 38:07.539
No, I cut this on a broken glass.

38:07.540 --> 38:09.020
She was pregnant!

38:10.220 --> 38:13.779
It's true. No, don't listen to him.
It was Oscar!

38:13.780 --> 38:17.260
Now he's been arrested,
we can go back to how things were.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.740
"How things were"?

38:19.940 --> 38:23.460
Before he tried to take you from me!
See, all this is his fault!

38:25.020 --> 38:26.260
I didn't mean to...

38:27.780 --> 38:30.299
I knew Oscar would find out
that you didn't write him that note

38:30.300 --> 38:32.460
saying you weren't going
to elope together.

38:33.540 --> 38:37.299
So I went to your dressing room,
to tell you how I felt.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.700
To tell you that you deserve
more than him.

38:41.180 --> 38:43.380
That he can't love you.
Not like I can.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.580
But it wasn't you.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.260
It was her.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.060
She saw my pain...

38:57.740 --> 39:00.340
..and all she could do was mock!

39:03.820 --> 39:06.100
That must have been
very distressing.

39:07.300 --> 39:10.699
I knew Verity would've told you
what I'd said just to humiliate me.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.619
I had to speak to you first.

39:12.620 --> 39:16.500
So I came here to Oscar's room
to find you, but you weren't here.

39:17.660 --> 39:19.740
And that's when I saw
the broken mirror.

39:22.340 --> 39:24.700
I could hear her voice
going round and round in my head,

39:24.740 --> 39:26.100
laughing at me.

39:26.140 --> 39:28.979
Laughing at us!
I had to make it stop.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.940
VERITY GASPS

39:33.700 --> 39:35.540
And after you killed her...

39:36.900 --> 39:39.540
..you realised
that you could frame Oscar

39:39.580 --> 39:42.219
and have Joselyn for yourself.

39:42.220 --> 39:45.179
So you planted the evidence

39:45.180 --> 39:47.140
and dropped a few hints.

39:47.180 --> 39:50.100
We can go now,
start a life together.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.939
This is why I blackmailed Maurice.

39:51.940 --> 39:54.819
I got the money for us!
Us?

39:54.820 --> 39:56.619
There's never been an "us".

39:56.620 --> 39:59.220
We were only ever friends,
and now...

39:59.260 --> 40:01.819
No. You don't mean that!
You don't mean that. It's not...

40:01.820 --> 40:02.980
Don't touch me!

40:06.580 --> 40:08.300
No! No!

40:08.340 --> 40:12.260
No!

40:14.900 --> 40:16.460
Sir!

40:16.500 --> 40:19.740
No!
Stay there! Don't move!

40:19.780 --> 40:21.260
No! Get off me!

40:21.300 --> 40:23.019
Fifi, please...

40:23.020 --> 40:24.300
Please.

40:24.340 --> 40:25.860
Why should I?

40:27.620 --> 40:29.180
Because you're unwell.

40:30.540 --> 40:32.940
You think I'm ill
because I'm in love with a woman?

40:32.980 --> 40:35.020
That's not what I meant.

40:36.460 --> 40:39.660
Fifi, this is all so sudden.
I thought we were just friends.

40:41.140 --> 40:43.020
But maybe, if I had time...

40:44.740 --> 40:46.980
..to make sense of everything...

40:49.020 --> 40:50.820
You mean...?

40:50.860 --> 40:52.180
Come here.

40:54.540 --> 40:56.219
We could be so happy.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.340
It was her!

41:19.700 --> 41:23.500
And you will write to me
from London? Every week.

41:23.540 --> 41:27.580
You do realise your parents will
never talk to me again?

41:27.620 --> 41:29.620
I'm sorry. For everything.

41:29.660 --> 41:32.900
And I'm sorry
for leaping to conclusions.

41:32.940 --> 41:37.740
I only ever had
your best interests at heart.

41:37.780 --> 41:42.099
But I can see now that this is much
more than just some giddy fling.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.540
I'll look after her, I promise.

41:46.100 --> 41:49.379
Well, we're all much safer
now that mad woman is locked up!

41:49.380 --> 41:52.219
What will happen to her?
Heaven only knows.

41:52.220 --> 41:55.459
Inspector Mallory has requested
an assessment

41:55.460 --> 41:57.460
of her mental state of mind.

41:57.500 --> 42:01.140
The police found a bundle
of love letters in her lodgings...

42:01.180 --> 42:02.620
to you.

42:04.420 --> 42:06.100
She was obsessed.

42:06.140 --> 42:09.740
And being so cruelly mocked when she
finally revealed her feelings

42:09.780 --> 42:11.260
tipped her over the edge.

42:11.300 --> 42:12.859
Thank you.

42:12.860 --> 42:14.220
For everything.

42:14.260 --> 42:15.980
You're welcome.

42:17.620 --> 42:21.059
I only hope that you find
an occupation in London

42:21.060 --> 42:23.460
that makes the most
of your intellect.

42:23.500 --> 42:27.140
Don't worry,
I know exactly what I'm going to do.

42:27.180 --> 42:28.180
Yes?

42:29.380 --> 42:31.180
I'm going to be an actress!

42:33.460 --> 42:36.620
Best be off.
Don't want to miss the train.

42:36.660 --> 42:37.739
Goodbye!

42:37.740 --> 42:38.900
Goodbye.

42:44.220 --> 42:45.620
Goodbye, Father.

42:50.300 --> 42:52.500
Where did I go wrong?

42:55.500 --> 42:57.459
Whatever do you mean?

42:57.460 --> 43:01.780
My job was to safeguard
her moral wellbeing.

43:01.820 --> 43:04.900
And I always thought
she was on the right track.

43:04.940 --> 43:08.019
But it turns out she's been taking
her clothes off

43:08.020 --> 43:09.980
in front of complete strangers

43:10.020 --> 43:13.059
and now she's running off to London
with a... a musician.

43:13.060 --> 43:16.299
I think you've done
a marvellous job.

43:16.300 --> 43:21.780
Joselyn is loving, confident,
bright and courageous.

43:23.020 --> 43:27.459
She put herself in danger
to prove another person's innocence.

43:27.460 --> 43:29.020
Yes.

43:29.060 --> 43:31.300
Yes, I suppose that's right.

43:31.340 --> 43:38.700
And perhaps, as you have appeared
on the stage of a burlesque club,

43:38.740 --> 43:41.739
you shouldn't be the first
to throw stones?

43:41.740 --> 43:44.539
Mention that one more time...

43:44.540 --> 43:49.180
and I'll tell the bishop that you
have been enjoying the company

43:49.220 --> 43:50.820
of strippers and harlots.

43:51.900 --> 43:56.500
Yes, well, then, perhaps, in the
case of The Crimson Feather Club...

43:56.540 --> 43:58.700
there should be a vow of silence.
