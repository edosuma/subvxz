09:33.050 --> 09:34.225
WHY AIN'T Y'ALL MOVING?

09:36.358 --> 09:38.142
OUR BAD.
WE DIDN'T KNOW IF
YOU WERE FINISHED

09:38.186 --> 09:40.318
OR IF THAT WAS JUST
ANOTHER PAUSE FOR EFFECT.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.624
MAN, GET YOUR
SMART ASSES

09:41.668 --> 09:43.365
GEARED UP
AND ON THAT FIELD

09:43.408 --> 09:44.932
OR I'LL GIVE YOU
ANOTHER DAMN MONOLOGUE.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.411
COME ON, NOW.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.065
STOP DIGGING AT
THE BALL, RASHAAN.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.893
THIS AIN'T LITTLE LEAGUE.
THAT'S IT.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.287
COME THROW THE DAMN BALL.
COME THROW IT!

09:52.330 --> 09:53.897
THAT'S IT.
GOOD CATCH, SON.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.203
WOMAN: ♪ CAN I HIT IT,
HIT IT, HIT IT ♪

09:55.246 --> 09:56.508
♪ CAN I GO UNTIL I GET IT

09:56.552 --> 09:57.858

09:57.901 --> 09:58.859
♪ CAN I PUSH IT
TO THE LIMIT... ♪

09:58.902 --> 10:00.600
DIAL IT BACK, SIMS.

10:00.643 --> 10:01.775
I GOT OUTFIELDERS
WAITING TO CATCH SOMETHING.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.428
LET THEM BOYS
HIT NOW.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.952
EY, IF THEY WANT TO BE THE BEST,
THEY GOTTA LEARN

10:04.995 --> 10:06.823
TO HIT OFF THE BEST, RIGHT?

10:06.867 --> 10:09.478
WE'RE HERE TO WIN, FELLAS.
Y'ALL GOT THAT?

10:09.521 --> 10:10.479
I HAVE REASONS
FOR THE WAY I'M

10:10.522 --> 10:11.915
RUNNING MY PRACTICE.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.090

10:22.970 --> 10:24.754
MAN: ALL RIGHT, SIMS.
YOU'RE DONE.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.321
ROBERTS! YOU'RE UP.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.496
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT, Y'ALL

10:27.539 --> 10:28.758
BENCHING ME
DURING PRACTICE?

10:28.802 --> 10:30.107
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH IT,

10:30.151 --> 10:31.326
TAKE IT UP
WITH COACH MARCUS.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.545
LET'S GO.
COME ON, ROBERTS.

10:33.589 --> 10:36.940
COACH. YO, COACH.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.812
LOOK, I'M JUST
MOTIVATING HIM, ALL RIGHT?

10:38.855 --> 10:39.987
THESE GUYS DON'T
GET IT...

10:40.030 --> 10:41.684
SHUT UP AND LISTEN
FOR ONCE!

10:41.728 --> 10:44.034
FOR ONCE. OK?

10:44.078 --> 10:45.383
IF THEY DON'T HIT,
I CAN'T EVALUATE

10:45.427 --> 10:46.820
THEIR WEAKNESSES
AND FINE-TUNE THEM.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.691
YOU WANNA KNOW
THEIR WEAKNESSES?

10:48.735 --> 10:51.825
I SPENT THE LAST WEEK
WORKING WITH THESE GUYS.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.783
THEIR WEAKNESS IS
NOT ONE OF THEM
GOT THE ABILITY

10:53.827 --> 10:55.089
TO TAKE THEIR GAME
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.134
NOT ONE!

10:57.178 --> 10:58.527
YOU LOST YOUR
BEST PLAYERS WHEN

10:58.570 --> 11:00.442
YOUR STARTERS
WERE SUSPENDED.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.270
AND THE ONLY PERSON LEFT

11:02.313 --> 11:04.968
SEEMINGLY WORTH ANYTHING
IS SANTIAGO,

11:05.012 --> 11:06.491
AND HIS ASS IS
INCONSISTENT IN THE BOX

11:06.535 --> 11:07.797
BECAUSE HE LETS
HIS EMOTIONS

11:07.841 --> 11:09.799
CONTROL THE GAME.

11:09.843 --> 11:10.974
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

11:18.634 --> 11:21.550
YOU DONE?
GET OFF MY FIELD.

11:21.593 --> 11:22.594
COACH, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

11:22.638 --> 11:24.379
OFF MY FIELD, SIMS.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.294
-COACH.
-I'VE HEARD ENOUGH
FROM YOU TODAY.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.425
YOU CAN SIT THE
REST OF THE PRACTICE

11:27.469 --> 11:30.428
IN THE DUGOUT. GO.

11:30.472 --> 11:31.560
THE DUGOUT?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.171
I AIN'T GIVE UP
THE PROS TO SIT IN

11:34.215 --> 11:35.259
ANYBODY'S DUGOUT.

11:35.303 --> 11:36.957
WAIT A MINUTE.
EXCUSE ME?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.437
SIMS! DON'T YOU
WALK AWAY FROM ME.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.656
SIMS!

11:43.267 --> 11:45.226
WHAT'S EVERYONE
STANDING AROUND FOR?

11:51.972 --> 11:54.670
WOMAN:
PRESIDENT EZEKIEL ALLEN.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.064
JUST THE MAN I WAS
HEADED TO SEE.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.023
YOU USED MY WHOLE
GOVERNMENT NAME.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.111
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.460
LOOK, I AM A BELOVED

12:02.504 --> 12:03.897
PROFESSOR AT
THIS UNIVERSITY,

12:03.940 --> 12:06.203
AND DAMN GOOD
AT MY JOB.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.596
SO, MAKE MY
LIGHTER COURSE LOAD

12:07.639 --> 12:09.032
THIS SEMESTER
MAKE SENSE.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.425
ASSIGNMENTS ARE
AT THE DISCRETION

12:10.468 --> 12:11.774
OF YOUR DEPARTMENT
CHAIR, SO--

12:11.818 --> 12:13.123
DON'T DO THAT.
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER

12:13.167 --> 12:15.082
A LONG TIME, ZEKE.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.692
YOU OWE ME THE TRUTH.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.260
ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN, NOW, THIS

12:19.303 --> 12:20.957
WASN'T MY CALL,

12:21.001 --> 12:22.524
BUT THERE ARE
SOME TRUSTEES

12:22.567 --> 12:24.004
AND SOME
INFLUENTIAL PARENTS...

12:24.047 --> 12:25.570
YOU MEAN
FULL TUITION PARENTS.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.137
I MEAN PARENTS
WHOSE SONS WERE

12:27.181 --> 12:28.530
PART OF THE BASEBALL
GROUP SUSPENDED

12:28.573 --> 12:30.227
FOR TAKING PAPER COURSES.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.099
THEY'RE PUTTING A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON ME

12:32.142 --> 12:33.404
TO LET YOU GO.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.276
I DIDN'T PERPETRATE
THAT SCANDAL.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.408
ALL I DID WAS BRING
THE CHEATING TO LIGHT

12:37.452 --> 12:39.584
AND PROTECT
THIS INSTITUTION.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.151
WELL, NOT EVERYONE
AGREES WITH HOW

12:41.195 --> 12:42.718
BRINGSTON'S DIRTY LAUNDRY
WAS AIRED.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.067
SO, WE'RE SHOOTING
THE MESSENGER?

12:44.111 --> 12:45.503
AMARA, THEY JUST
WANT SOMEBODY

12:45.547 --> 12:47.375
TO BE MAD AT.

12:47.418 --> 12:50.813
AND RIGHT NOW, FAIR OR
UNFAIR, THAT'S YOU.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.206
YOU'RE A WHISTLEBLOWER,

12:52.249 --> 12:53.555
AND THAT COMES
WITH ITS OWN CRAP.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.819
DO YOU AGREE WITH THEM?

12:56.863 --> 12:59.300
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.824
BUT MY FEELINGS AREN'T
ALWAYS WHAT MATTERS.

13:01.868 --> 13:05.088
LOOK, THIS
WILL BLOW OVER.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.916
YOU JUST NEED TO
KEEP A LOW PROFILE

13:06.960 --> 13:09.136
UNTIL THEY FIND
SOMETHING ELSE
TO FIXATE ON.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.790
MY REDUCING
YOUR COURSE LOAD

13:10.833 --> 13:12.226
WAS THE BEST WAY
I COULD THINK

13:12.269 --> 13:14.054
TO HELP YOU KEEP
THAT LOW PROFILE.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.446
IT'S BETTER THAN
LOSING YOUR JOB,

13:15.490 --> 13:17.100
WHICH IS WHAT
THEY WANTED.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.060
NOW, I HAVE TO GO.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.941
AMARA: I AM SO, SO SORRY

13:31.985 --> 13:33.813
I DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME
TO HELP YOU MOVE IN.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.250
IT'S OK, AUNTIE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.294
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT ME HANGING

13:37.338 --> 13:38.469
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.297
IS EVERYTHING OK?

13:40.341 --> 13:41.995
IT WILL BE.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.040
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.694
MY BABY IS OFFICIALLY

13:45.737 --> 13:47.174
A COLLEGE FRESHMAN.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.740
[BOTH LAUGH]

13:48.784 --> 13:50.090
AND TO CELEBRATE...

13:50.133 --> 13:51.352
FOR ME?

13:51.395 --> 13:52.875
YOU THINK I RANDOMLY

13:52.919 --> 13:54.007
WALK AROUND CAMPUS

13:54.050 --> 13:56.966
WITH GIFT BASKETS?
HA HA!

13:57.010 --> 13:59.229
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE FRESHMAN

13:59.273 --> 14:00.796
WELCOME BOX
OF ESSENTIALS

14:00.840 --> 14:01.884
I PUT TOGETHER.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.407
-YEAH.
-YOU KNOW.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.974
SHOWER SLIPPERS,

14:05.018 --> 14:07.542
WIPES, DISINFECTANT SPRAY.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.500
COLLEGE KIDS ARE NASTY.
PROTECT YOURSELF.

14:09.544 --> 14:13.026
OK, AUNTIE.
OH, WOW!

14:15.289 --> 14:17.073
WOW. REALLY?

14:17.117 --> 14:18.466
NOW, I KNOW YOU
DON'T EXPECT ME

14:18.509 --> 14:19.902
TO STAND HERE
AND PRETEND LIKE

14:19.946 --> 14:21.556
WE BOTH DON'T KNOW
YOU HAVE SEX.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.253
I'M NOT SAYING
ALL THAT.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.472
I'M JUST SAYING I'M

14:24.515 --> 14:25.690
NOT GONNA NEED THOSE
RIGHT NOW.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.910
OH, SO, JORDAN IS NEVER

14:27.954 --> 14:29.042
COMING TO VISIT.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.220
I REST MY CASE.
THE CONDOMS STAY.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.004
OK.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.266
SO, IS THAT WHAT
HAS YOU DOWN?

14:36.310 --> 14:38.486
JORDAN BEING SO FAR AWAY?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.140
THAT'S CUTE,
THAT YOU THOUGHT

14:40.183 --> 14:42.969
YOU WERE HIDING
ANYTHING FROM ME.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.275
I JUST MISS EVERYTHING.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.235
JORDAN, BABY SHAY,
MY FRIENDS,

14:48.278 --> 14:50.150
MY LIFE BACK IN
BEVERLY HILLS.

14:52.369 --> 14:53.718
AUNTIE, WHAT IF I MADE
THE WRONG CHOICE

14:53.762 --> 14:55.633
COMING TO COLLEGE
SO FAR AWAY?

14:55.677 --> 14:58.941
YOU'RE GOING TO
BE FINE, SIMONE.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.551
YOU'LL FIND YOUR FOOTING

15:00.595 --> 15:02.553
AND YOU'LL FIND
YOUR PEOPLE.

15:02.597 --> 15:06.253
PROBABLY HERE ON THESE
TENNIS COURTS, FRANKLY.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.776
AND ONCE YOU
START BONDING

15:07.819 --> 15:10.039
WITH YOUR
SOON-TO-BE-TEAMMATES,

15:10.083 --> 15:12.520
BRINGSTON WILL START
TO FEEL LIKE HOME.

15:12.563 --> 15:13.695
TRUST ME.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.178
HOME.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.658
MARCUS: THAT'S IT.
GET DOWN.

15:20.702 --> 15:21.659
THERE YOU GO. GO!

15:21.703 --> 15:22.791
THERE--THERE IT IS.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.883
COME ON, THAT'S IT.
GET DOWN, ROBERTS.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.407
THERE YOU GO.
TAKE 'EM IN, COACH YEE.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.410
I DON'T SEE
MY STAR PLAYER.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.240
IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO DAMON SIMS,

15:37.284 --> 15:39.025
HE WAS BEING PROBLEMATIC.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.200
SO, I BENCHED HIM.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.462
THIS ENTIRE PROGRAM
RESTS ON

15:41.505 --> 15:43.290
THAT BOY'S SHOULDERS.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.770
PROBLEMATIC OR NOT,
YOU MAKE SURE
HE GETS WHAT HE NEEDS.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.599
THIS IS A TEAM SPORT.
WE RISE TOGETHER,
WE FALL TOGETHER.

15:48.643 --> 15:49.905
SIMS'LL COME ON
BOARD EVENTUALLY.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.515
EVENTUALLY WON'T
BE SOON ENOUGH.

15:52.690 --> 15:53.909
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.563
THE UNIVERSITY
IS WORKING THROUGH

15:55.606 --> 15:57.434
SOME FINANCIAL ISSUES.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.133
YEAH, US AND EVERY
OTHER HBCU.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.917
SO, WHY IS
THIS DIFFERENT?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.354
WE HAD TO TAKE SOME
AGGRESSIVE MEASURES THIS YEAR.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.921
AS A RESULT,
SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS

16:05.965 --> 16:08.532
ARE ON THE SHORT LIST
FOR BEING CUT,

16:08.576 --> 16:10.012
AND GIVEN THE
BASEBALL PROGRAM'S

16:10.056 --> 16:12.667
ALREADY ON SHAKY GROUND
AS IS...

16:12.710 --> 16:14.799
DAMN, WE MOVED TO
THE TOP OF THAT LIST.

16:14.843 --> 16:17.977
WE'RE JUST GETTING
STARTED, MAN.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.891
BUILDING A CHAMPIONSHIP
TEAM TAKES TIME.

16:19.935 --> 16:23.156
THAT IS SOMETHING YOU
DON'T HAVE ANYMORE, TURNER.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.679
NOW, IF YOU CAN'T
MAKE THIS

16:24.722 --> 16:26.637
DAMON SIMS
EXPERIMENT WORK

16:26.681 --> 16:28.639
AND TURN THE LIONS INTO
A CHAMPIONSHIP CALIBER TEAM

16:28.683 --> 16:29.727
BY THE END OF
THE SEMESTER...

16:29.771 --> 16:31.077
SEMESTER?

16:31.120 --> 16:33.253
THERE'LL BE NO PROGRAM
COME SPRING.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.527
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

16:46.570 --> 16:48.442
AMARA: YOU GOT A SECOND?
MARCUS: OF COURSE.

16:48.485 --> 16:51.227
I REALIZE I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.276
IT'S COME TO MY
ATTENTION THAT

16:56.319 --> 16:57.886
NOT EVERYONE
IS OVERJOYED

16:57.929 --> 17:00.149
WITH THE FACT THAT I EXPOSED
SHAW'S CHEATING.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.804
I MEAN, I EXPECTED
A FEW PEOPLE

17:02.847 --> 17:04.936
TO BE IN THEIR
FEELINGS, BUT

17:04.980 --> 17:07.591
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS

17:07.635 --> 17:09.158
IT CUTS A LITTLE DEEPER

17:09.202 --> 17:11.552
WHEN IT'S YOUR OWN
PEOPLE TURNING ON YOU.

17:13.945 --> 17:18.080
ANYWAY, I REALIZE NOW THAT

17:18.124 --> 17:19.951
MINE ISN'T THE ONLY FUTURE

17:19.995 --> 17:21.649
AFFECTED BY MY ACTIONS.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.782
YOU FINALLY GOT
YOUR DREAM OF BEING

17:24.826 --> 17:28.221
A HEAD COACH,
BUT BECAUSE OF ME,

17:28.264 --> 17:29.874
IT'S OVERSHADOWED
BY ALL THIS

17:29.918 --> 17:33.269
SCANDAL NONSENSE.
I'M SORRY.

17:33.313 --> 17:36.229
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR, AMARA.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.405
IN FACT, I WAS
GONNA TELL YOU--

17:38.448 --> 17:40.015
DAMON: COACH, I--I DON'T MEAN TO

17:40.059 --> 17:41.669
INTERRUPT YOU GUYS, BUT

17:41.712 --> 17:43.888
COACH, I KIND OF REALLY
NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.282
OH, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.589
I'M SCHEDULED TO
TALK SOMEBODY ELSE'S

17:48.632 --> 17:49.807
EAR OFF ANYWAY.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.377
LOOK, WHATEVER
IT IS, SIMS,

17:54.421 --> 17:56.118
IT BETTER BE PREFACED
BY AN APOLOGY

17:56.162 --> 17:58.512
FOR WALKING OUT
ON YOUR TEAM.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.035
