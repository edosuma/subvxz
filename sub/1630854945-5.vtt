- OK, pens down.

- So, Claire, what would being
homecoming queen mean to you?

00:11.440 --> 00:15.710
- The only homecoming that
matters this year is Maddie's.

00:15.910 --> 00:17.610
- That's funny, I haven't
heard you say two words to her

00:17.810 --> 00:19.580
since I've been at this school.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.680
Claire, she says she doesn't
care about homecoming,

00:21.880 --> 00:23.190

00:23.390 --> 00:24.850

<i>- Where'd you get that phone?</i>

- I know everyone's passcodes.

No. One more. 40.

Charley,
you want to ride the pony?

Oh, OK.

So would that be

02:31.650 --> 02:32.920
- I don't know
what those things mean.

02:33.110 --> 02:34.420
It's a countdown, baby.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.320
We got ten hours
until the homecoming game.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.720
We got to pump it up.
Let's go.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.620
Oh, we are pumped, Wally.

02:39.820 --> 02:42.290

All right.

Now, is everyone signed up
for a prep committee?

02:52.730 --> 02:56.440
We still need more help with
decorations and refreshments.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.380
Where's Maddie?

02:59.580 --> 03:02.110
- Oh, maybe she walked off
during a pony ride.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.610
- Nobody should be
wandering off, Charley.

03:04.810 --> 03:05.780
Yeah, he's right.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.080
This banner is not gonna
paint itself, OK?

- Oh, no.

03:08.450 --> 03:09.690

She likes me more.

OK, if both of you guys go,

03:14.120 --> 03:16.690
Who is making
my crown of sparklers?

03:16.890 --> 03:18.590
I added that to give this year
a little bit more sizzle.

03:18.790 --> 03:22.030
I mean, it's gonna be--
OK, sorry.

03:22.230 --> 03:23.600
Fine, I will stay

03:23.800 --> 03:25.900

blow up your balloons.

- No. No, no.
That's OK.

What?

03:57.900 --> 03:59.200
You got to wonder, right?

03:59.400 --> 04:02.540
How far Claire's cult
will go to impress her.

04:02.740 --> 04:05.440
- What?
You mean like murder someone?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.710
- Don't look shocked.
They live for her approval.

04:07.910 --> 04:09.510
- Yeah, but you really think
they'd kill for it?

04:09.710 --> 04:10.850
I mean, they can barely
get dressed

04:11.050 --> 04:12.380
without consulting Claire
first.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.320
- Fair, but, Maddie, we've been
tailing her for a week.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.120
We still have no idea how
she's connected to Anderson.

04:27.730 --> 04:31.030
How were you even
friends with her anyway?

04:31.230 --> 04:32.840
We were neighbors.

04:33.030 --> 04:34.270
You know, it was easy.

04:34.470 --> 04:37.040
- Then what,
she just ditched you one day

04:37.240 --> 04:40.780

04:40.980 --> 04:42.280
Not exactly.

for a year.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.780
And her mom remarried
that rich guy.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.790

Jesus, Maddie.

What if she's still
holding on to that?

It's Maddie, right?

I have so much
that I have to do.

but there's nothing here.

will be chaperoning

08:01.340 --> 08:02.450

08:02.640 --> 08:04.450
- Can you chaperone
wearing an ankle monitor?

- Maybe if they move the dance
to a federal prison.

Your parents must be
really pissed.

Didn't they give, like, a ton
of money to the booster club?

Yeah, they did.

How are you doing, Claire?

08:28.500 --> 08:29.710
And what can I do for you?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.410

what's going on

didn't he?

that we have put Mr. Anderson

and the Split River

08:42.750 --> 08:43.550

08:43.750 --> 08:45.190
It's been a week.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.260
Has he admitted anything?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.590
Was he working alone,
or did he hint

08:49.790 --> 08:51.030
that anyone else was involved?

She's fishing.

a reasonable explanation.

Yeah, there is.

He's a thief.

lose it

found out myself.

10:00.430 --> 10:01.930
- Who's your source?
Xavier.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.270
- Simon, we're all
on the same side here.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.670
What was inside the backpack?

10:04.870 --> 10:06.870
They sure it's Maddie's?
Did they find a weapon too?

10:07.070 --> 10:08.040
Why are you yelling at me?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.070
- What else is
Xavier feeding you?

10:10.270 --> 10:12.440
Ask him yourself.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.910
- Did you tell him?
- She told me.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.080
Where is this place?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.250
- It's an abandoned house
on White Oak

10:17.450 --> 10:18.450
they're about to tear down.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.620
- Who's they?
- Claire's stepfather.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.750
- He owns the whole block.
- Yeah, of course he does.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.150
- Just because
he owns the place

10:24.350 --> 10:25.450
it doesn't mean she has
anything to do with it.

10:25.650 --> 10:27.090
- You know that.
- Right, defend Claire.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.630
- She's an angel.
- That's not what he said.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.760
Simon thinks Claire may be
connected to what

10:31.960 --> 10:32.900
happened to Maddie because--

10:33.090 --> 10:34.630
- Because I know things.
- Like what?

10:34.830 --> 10:36.570
A week ago,
you thought I had something

10:36.770 --> 10:37.600

You know, she's applying

Wow.

Nope. I got everything.

No.

Claire's English papers.

15:31.190 --> 15:33.560
Read that one.

- "In George Orwell's dystopia,
nothing is sacred,

15:35.860 --> 15:38.100
not even the privacy
of one's own home."

15:38.300 --> 15:39.940
OK, it's her paper on "1984."

15:40.140 --> 15:42.770
- So what?
- Now read this one.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.580
- "In George Orwell's dystopia,
nothing is sacred,

15:46.770 --> 15:49.910

15:50.110 --> 15:51.250

"Pride and Prejudice."

15:55.420 --> 15:56.290
"Lord of the Flies."

"And Then There Were None."

15:57.750 --> 15:59.690
"Hamlet." They're all the same.

15:59.890 --> 16:01.420
She read one book this year
but got straight As.

16:08.060 --> 16:10.800

16:18.540 --> 16:20.710
Simon, you didn't see my mom.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.880
She was so--

16:23.080 --> 16:24.880
and whatever this is,
if it comes out,

16:25.080 --> 16:27.780
all it means is that the mom
I saw in there goes away.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.050
You know?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.990
Maybe never comes back.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.730
- So then we just
let Claire get away

16:36.920 --> 16:39.360

a part in your death?

pay someone off anyway.

And either way, I'm still dead.

16:54.940 --> 16:59.580
But maybe if we just
put all this on hold...

They flew out of there

helping Sandra

No, I think his lawyers
told him not to talk.

All we've heard is that
he turned over the money.

He was always
so kind to Maddie.

money, I don't blame him.

pay teachers enough.

something to do with Maddie?

really not for us to solve.

We're just gonna
have to wait and see.

27:22.670 --> 27:26.710
Besides, the truth
might never come out.

27:26.910 --> 27:28.780
- I swear, when she's screaming
her head off like that,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.610
I feel like she can
still see me out there.

27:31.810 --> 27:33.750
- Maybe she does.
- Oh. Eww!

27:33.950 --> 27:36.080
Even you just saying that
stressed me out.

both of those are for you.

through a rough patch, um,

28:02.710 --> 28:04.010
she mostly cared about
what there was to drink.

28:04.210 --> 28:07.820
And so I was
kind of on my own for dinner.

28:08.020 --> 28:12.590

13-year-old know how to make?

with them.

casserole, hot dog omelet.

peanut butter and jelly.

Hey, Wally, what's going on?

32:40.790 --> 32:41.960
- Mom, you should
not be down here.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.490
- And you shouldn't be
on that bench.

32:43.690 --> 32:44.960
Where's Dad?

32:45.160 --> 32:46.630
- He's up there,
and he agrees with me, OK?

32:46.830 --> 32:50.000
- Well, Mom, Coach wants me
to rest my knee, so--

32:50.200 --> 32:52.270
- Well, you know what they say.
You can rest when you're dead.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.470
Do you want me to talk to him?

32:53.670 --> 32:54.740
- No.
No, don't--don't talk to the--

32:54.930 --> 32:56.270
OK, you know, Mom,
he said he's gonna

32:56.470 --> 32:58.310
put me in later, so you don't
have to worry about it.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.910
- Later doesn't win
scholarships, Wally.

33:01.110 --> 33:03.480
OK?

33:03.680 --> 33:05.580
OK, well, I think he's right.

33:05.780 --> 33:07.250
- Honey,
if Coach was always right,

33:07.450 --> 33:08.450
he'd be coaching in the pros

33:08.650 --> 33:09.480
and not benching
high schoolers.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.750
- He's my coach.
- You're a star.

33:10.950 --> 33:11.720
- I'm gonna listen
to what he's saying.

33:11.920 --> 33:12.720
And he needs to play you.

33:12.920 --> 33:13.960
Now you just march over to him

33:14.150 --> 33:15.490
and tell him you're fine,
all right?

33:15.690 --> 33:17.990
Tell him you want back in.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.860
What are we talking about?

35:31.060 --> 35:34.900
- I can't protect my mom
by giving up.

35:35.090 --> 35:37.630
She has to know I'm not
coming home, good or bad.

35:37.830 --> 35:41.270
You know, she has to move on.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.570
So do I.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.350

this was going on?

35:54.550 --> 35:55.580
Of course not.

35:55.780 --> 35:56.950
All I know is
what Simon told us

35:57.150 --> 35:58.550
about Mr. Anderson's phone call

35:58.750 --> 35:59.850
and the money
and the phone shard.

36:00.050 --> 36:01.290
Are you sure that's all?

36:01.490 --> 36:03.420
What the fuck, Nicole?

36:03.620 --> 36:04.960
All I did was
take Maddie's phone

36:05.160 --> 36:06.760
so I could delete
that stupid cheating text.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.760
I mean,
Claire must have stolen it,

36:09.960 --> 36:11.600
swapped it with a blank one.

36:16.070 --> 36:17.740
Maybe I should just show
this video to my dad.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.170
No, you can't do that.

36:19.370 --> 36:20.740
He's gonna think you had
something to do with it again,

36:20.940 --> 36:23.040

to keep clearing your name.

36:35.690 --> 36:36.690
Are you OK?

36:36.890 --> 36:38.290
I think it's too much.

36:38.490 --> 36:40.630
I shouldn't have...

36:40.830 --> 36:43.000
I just need to go home--

36:43.200 --> 36:44.870
now.

36:46.530 --> 36:47.970
I can take you, Sandra.

36:48.170 --> 36:49.140
Would you?

36:49.340 --> 36:50.400
I just need to take care
of something.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.910
- Everything cool?
- Yeah.

36:53.110 --> 36:56.010
- Just keep me updated.
Text me if anything happens.

36:56.210 --> 36:58.150
Come on.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.160
Hey, Simon, what's up?

37:12.360 --> 37:13.830
What are we gonna do
about this video?

37:14.030 --> 37:15.330
- It's about what
you have to do.

37:15.530 --> 37:17.330
Win back Claire's confidence,
and then you crack her.

37:17.530 --> 37:19.070
But how am I gonna do that?

37:19.270 --> 37:20.970
- Simon, tell him to ask her
to the homecoming dance.

37:21.170 --> 37:22.440
- Ask her
to the homecoming dance.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.670
You're shitting me, right?

37:23.870 --> 37:24.940
The girl hates me.

37:25.140 --> 37:26.510
After Maddie disappeared,
I pushed her away,

37:26.710 --> 37:28.180
and it really pissed her off.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.810
Claire doesn't want
anything to do with me.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.610
- Apologize.
Send her a text.

37:31.810 --> 37:32.650
Apologize.

37:32.850 --> 37:33.650
Send her a text.

37:33.850 --> 37:34.720
What do I say?

37:34.910 --> 37:36.880
both: I'll tell you.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.920
- I'm gonna try this.
I don't think it's gonna work.

37:40.120 --> 37:43.190
- I know I hurt you.
- I know I hurt you.

37:43.390 --> 37:46.630
- I feel your sadness,
and I'm sorry.

37:46.830 --> 37:49.030
I feel your anger,
and I deserve that.

37:49.230 --> 37:52.300
- I feel your sadness,
and I'm sorry.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.040
I feel your anger, and I--

37:55.230 --> 37:58.070
- I deserve that.
- I deserve that.

37:58.270 --> 38:00.140
- I wish I could
erase what happened.

38:00.340 --> 38:02.380
And if there's anything
I can do to make it up to you,

38:02.580 --> 38:03.740
I want to try.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.480
- I wish I could
erase what happened.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.350
If there's any way I can make
it up to you, I want to try.

38:07.550 --> 38:11.120
- Yeah, hold up, dude.
You're going too fast.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.510

39:00.800 --> 39:03.540
I just wanted to thank you.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.170
I don't know, I just--I feel--

39:08.370 --> 39:09.780

You know, I don't think
I've ever met anybody

39:13.680 --> 39:15.180
like you before.

39:17.220 --> 39:20.750
- Yeah.
Well, same.

39:20.950 --> 39:22.260

39:22.460 --> 39:24.290
- Definitely never been
to a football game before.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.930
I don't feel like I've ever
been able to talk to someone

39:30.130 --> 39:31.970
like I can talk to you.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.340
Yeah.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.100
Tonight was nice.

39:39.410 --> 39:42.480
- Do you want to go
to the dance with me?

39:42.680 --> 39:44.040
As friends.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.410
You can totally say no, Maddie.

39:45.610 --> 39:47.110
I just--you know,
it's your first time.

39:47.310 --> 39:48.920
I thought maybe I could--
you're gonna be there anyway.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.020
Sure, Wally.

39:51.220 --> 39:55.490
- All right, that's--
all right, that's, uh, cool.

39:55.690 --> 39:56.820
That's really cool.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.690
I will--I'll see you
at the dance.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.290
So hell yeah.

40:00.490 --> 40:02.060
All right.

40:05.770 --> 40:08.040
Hey.

40:08.230 --> 40:11.840
I know this may be a stretch,
but I think I know

40:12.040 --> 40:15.040
who may have taken that video.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.310
When you gave me
your keys earlier,

40:16.510 --> 40:18.310
was it because
there was something

40:18.510 --> 40:19.650
you wanted me to know?

40:19.850 --> 40:20.980
I don't understand.

40:21.180 --> 40:22.580
- Did you want me to find
something, Mr. South?

40:22.780 --> 40:24.690
- Simon, if I've got
something to say, I say it.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.320
- But when I came by
this morning,

40:26.520 --> 40:29.790
you were watching a video,
and you hid it from me.

40:29.990 --> 40:31.220
And now we get sent this video,

40:31.420 --> 40:33.730
and I'm thinking
it could be you.

40:33.930 --> 40:34.930
Simon, I was hiding it

40:35.130 --> 40:37.500
because I didn't want you
to get hurt.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.570
Ever since they found your
friend's blood on the wall,

40:39.770 --> 40:42.200
all kinds of looky-loos been
coming down here sightseeing.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.870

I'd be the number one stop

40:44.070 --> 40:45.370
on a haunted tour?

40:45.570 --> 40:48.610
- I had to document everything
for the school district.

40:48.810 --> 40:51.750
People wrote things on the wall
that were...

40:51.950 --> 40:54.820
disrespectful.

40:55.010 --> 40:56.980
That was on me.

40:57.180 --> 40:59.920
Don't blame yourself.

41:00.120 --> 41:00.950
All right?

41:01.150 --> 41:02.960
This isn't on you.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.830
I'll clean it up.

41:05.020 --> 41:07.390
You still need help?

41:07.590 --> 41:09.460
- Sorry to make you
leave early.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.260
Oh, no. I don't mind.

41:11.460 --> 41:13.970
Pretty sure
we were losing anyway.

41:17.770 --> 41:21.210
- Do you think Maddie will
forgive me and come home?

41:27.780 --> 41:31.280
- I'd like to think we can be
forgiven for anything

41:31.480 --> 41:33.350
if our heart's
in the right place.

41:39.090 --> 41:40.830
Can I have a hug?

41:41.030 --> 41:43.000
Of course.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.040
I needed that.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.650
I'll help you get
the stuff in the car.

41:57.840 --> 41:58.680
- Oh, no, no.
I got it.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.580
You can get in the car.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.220
It's OK.
