I had a very happy childhood.

All right, fine.

05:55.862 --> 05:59.564
My first childhood memory

05:59.566 --> 06:02.367
was my father disappearing
when I was three.

06:02.369 --> 06:04.202
He abandoned you
and your mother?

06:04.204 --> 06:05.654
No, he disappeared.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.573
He was an amateur magician
and it was his signature trick.

06:08.575 --> 06:10.575
Oh.

06:10.577 --> 06:13.995
And then when I was four,

06:13.997 --> 06:16.631
he ran off with
a lady sword swallower.

06:17.617 --> 06:20.034
At least that's what
my mother called her.

06:20.036 --> 06:23.588
In retrospect, it might have
been a euphemism.

06:24.390 --> 06:26.141
So what was your mother like?

06:26.143 --> 06:29.094
Well, after Dad left,
she raised me by herself.

06:29.096 --> 06:30.562
And how was that?

06:30.564 --> 06:32.147
It was great.

06:32.149 --> 06:34.316
She did everything for me.

06:34.318 --> 06:36.384
And I always felt
safe with her.

06:36.386 --> 06:38.270
That sounds wonderful.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.571
It was.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.240
And the saddest day of my life
was when it ended.

06:42.242 --> 06:43.558
Why, what happened?

06:43.560 --> 06:45.427

and your mother get along?

06:52.202 --> 06:54.502
Not very well.
I don't know why, though.

06:54.504 --> 06:56.571

they were so different.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.130

07:05.132 --> 07:06.931
And I always felt
very safe with her.

07:06.933 --> 07:10.302
Oh, isn't that what I said
about my mother?

07:10.304 --> 07:13.421
Oh, Walden, you went
and beat me to it.

07:13.423 --> 07:15.607

right down to it,

07:15.609 --> 07:16.891

07:18.695 --> 07:21.112
What are we saying here?

07:21.114 --> 07:24.316
That Bridget's right
and I am emotionally immature?

07:24.318 --> 07:25.784
And all those years

07:25.786 --> 07:28.937
I was treating her more
like a mother than a wife?

07:28.939 --> 07:30.989
And how would that
make you feel if that were true?

07:30.991 --> 07:33.107
That would make me feel
very angry.

07:33.109 --> 07:36.444

the cause of...

said before he disappeared.

07:46.305 --> 07:48.757
Is that it? Am I cured?

07:48.759 --> 07:51.626
Well, "cured" is one of those
laymen's terms

07:51.628 --> 07:54.629
that we psychiatrists
try to avoid.

07:54.631 --> 07:57.232
It hurts repeat business.

07:57.234 --> 07:58.616
Do I need to come back?

07:58.618 --> 08:00.652
I'm thinking three times
a week.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.153
Well, I was going to leave town.

08:02.155 --> 08:03.805
Well, then you have
a choice to make.

08:03.807 --> 08:06.608
You can stay here and make
your problems go away,

08:06.610 --> 08:09.027

08:09.029 --> 08:12.414

08:17.371 --> 08:19.170

You know, you're a great guy
and you deserve to be happy.

20:04.905 --> 20:08.574
And if you have to
move, I'd understand.

20:08.576 --> 20:11.393
But, uh, I want
you to know

20:11.395 --> 20:14.196
I-I'd really,
really miss you.

20:14.198 --> 20:18.083
I'd miss you, too.

20:18.085 --> 20:19.751
But I'm not going anywhere.

20:19.753 --> 20:21.403
Oh, you're not?

20:21.405 --> 20:23.755
Nah, the shrink's right.

20:23.757 --> 20:27.543
My problems are gonna
follow me wherever I go.

20:27.545 --> 20:31.296
Besides... how could I
leave my best friend?

20:33.551 --> 20:35.750
Aw...

20:41.057 --> 20:44.276
I'm the luckiest
guy in the world.

20:46.935 --> 20:48.235
Told you.

20:48.260 --> 20:52.260
