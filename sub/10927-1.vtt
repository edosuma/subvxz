01:00.527 --> 01:02.119
...dead people...

01:02.195 --> 01:04.220
...the recently departed...

01:04.297 --> 01:06.822
Unburied human corpses
are returning to life...

01:06.900 --> 01:08.265
and feeding on the living.

01:08.334 --> 01:09.392
Stay inside.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.130
Do not try to leave your homes.

01:11.204 --> 01:13.536
They seem to survive
by eating human flesh.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.801
Everyone who dies will
become one of them.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.002
If you are bitten, you will
just become one of them...

01:18.078 --> 01:19.739
that much sooner.

01:20.847 --> 01:24.146
They're not your neighbors
and friends, not anymore.

01:24.217 --> 01:25.707
My wife had a heart attack.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.753
Got up and came after me
like a banshee from hell.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.618
I put a curling iron through her head.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.782
...the head... the brain...

01:31.858 --> 01:33.849
They must be destroyed
as quickly as possible.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.986
There's no time for
funeral arrangements.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.689
There's no time to dig up holes...

01:37.764 --> 01:39.391
so you can drop these
things in the ground.

01:39.466 --> 01:40.660
As long as we're alive...

01:40.733 --> 01:42.166
they ain't never gonna run out of food.

01:42.235 --> 01:45.500
The day they do, it'll mean
only one thing: We're all dead.

01:45.672 --> 01:48.573
This is not only a local
or a regional phenomenon.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.404
Cities are under siege.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.938
If these creatures ever
develop the power to think...

01:57.016 --> 01:58.040
to reason...

01:58.118 --> 02:00.450
even in the most primitive way...

02:00.520 --> 02:02.511
People are said to be establishing...

02:02.589 --> 02:03.749
outposts in big cities...

02:03.823 --> 02:07.623
and raiding small rural towns
for supplies, like outlaws.

02:50.136 --> 02:51.433
¢Ü¢Ü

03:27.941 --> 03:29.568
They're trying to be us.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.473
No, they used to be us.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.535
Learning how to be us again.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.979
No way. Some germ or some devil
got those things up and walking...

03:38.051 --> 03:40.952
but there's a big difference
between us and them.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.411
They're dead.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.618
It's like they're
pretending to be alive.

03:48.695 --> 03:52.028
Isn't that what we're doing,
pretending to be alive?

03:56.269 --> 03:58.134
He knows we're here.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.541
Christ.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.242
It's like he's talking to them.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.179
Let's go.

04:32.905 --> 04:36.068
A whole lot of trash this
week. That's life, bro.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.975
Whole lot of trash, trick
is not to get in with it.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.391
You any good with that, kid?
Because I'm real good with mine.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.560
Put it away, Charlie.
Don't be so jumpy, kid.

05:04.570 --> 05:05.764
What are you doing?

05:05.838 --> 05:08.602
Watching your back. I don't like
it when you go off without me.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.905
I told you to get things
ready. I got things ready...

05:10.977 --> 05:13.309
then I come to watch your back.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.271
Christ! This is like a bad dream.

05:16.349 --> 05:17.646
I have bad dreams.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.647
Hell, yes. Just look at me, you
can tell I have terrible dreams.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.449
Riley, what's your 20?

05:22.522 --> 05:23.580
We checked out the town.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.352
There's plenty of supplies, but
a lot of walkers. Where's Cholo?

05:26.426 --> 05:28.291
He dumped the trash,
and he's on his way back.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.658
We're ready to go in. Okay.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.856
Put some flowers in the graveyard.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.599
"Flowers in the graveyard."
Why do you call them that, Riley?

05:38.671 --> 05:39.729
I don't get it.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.832
These here flowers ain't the
kind you lay down on the ground.

05:42.909 --> 05:46.106
These here are sky
flowers, way up in heaven.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.148
That's why I love you, Charlie.
Because you still believe in heaven.

05:49.215 --> 05:50.614
Lord, yeah.

05:52.952 --> 05:54.613
I mean, look.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.519
Nice driving.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.646
Riley, looks like God's left the
phone off the hook, huh, baby?

06:31.724 --> 06:33.988
Go get my ride. Get yours, too.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.652
What's the matter? You
look like shit, man.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.956
Didn't I tell you not to bang chicks...

06:37.029 --> 06:39.429
with problems worse than you?
When are going to listen me?

06:39.499 --> 06:42.764
You done? I'm never done, baby. Why?

06:43.603 --> 06:45.070
The town's full of walkers.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.696
Yeah, but every town is full of walkers.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.640
No, these guys are not just walking.
It's like they're communicating.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.973
They're thinking, and
there's something going on.

06:52.044 --> 06:53.978
But they're dumb, Riley.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.613
Well, hell. Dead folks
is near as dumb as me.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.651
You learned to make
yourself useful, didn't you?

06:59.719 --> 07:01.050
Yeah. That's what they're doing.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.212
Make yourself useful.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.415
You don't got one redeeming
defect, do you, son, huh?

07:04.490 --> 07:07.516
I got this! I got this! You
got that? You got that, too.

07:07.660 --> 07:11.061
Come on. Let's get to work before I
forget what it is I do for a living.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.859
Cholo, I'm talking to you.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.701
All right, what? Things are changing.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.397
Just be careful. We
go in, we do our job...

07:19.472 --> 07:21.770
and we get the fuck out
of there. Everyone alive.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.708
Now, you take command of this unit,
you can run it any way you like.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.338
But tonight, it's my last night
out. I don't want any fuck-ups.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.605
So, that's what it's about?

07:30.683 --> 07:33.151
You're not going to dump these
recycled delinquents on me.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.880
I don't want to take command.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.048
Because you know what? Tonight's
my last night, too, baby.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.852
Hey, you. Come here,
you little nose-picker.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.952
You been with Riley all
day painting the town beige?

07:43.029 --> 07:44.929
I'm gonna show you
how it's done. Come on.

07:45.364 --> 07:48.197
What'd he do, win the
lottery or something?

07:49.869 --> 07:51.234
Something.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.867
How come you guys
always go out at night?

07:55.942 --> 07:57.466
Wouldn't it be safer in the daytime?

07:58.845 --> 08:02.076
Fireworks, kid. Stenches
can't keep their eyes off them.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.976
Come on!

08:33.479 --> 08:35.003
Yeah!

08:58.204 --> 08:59.398
That sucker's mine, baby.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.136
I got that one.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.959
Number 1, how's the
food? Mostly canned stuff.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.355
I'd stay away from the fish.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.293
Number 2, what's your location?

10:03.369 --> 10:04.427
Drugstore.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.232
Need an aspirin? I
got a million of them.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.398
Antibiotics. We need antibiotics.

10:11.911 --> 10:16.143
They're gone. The sky
flowers, they're gone.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.244
That's not good, is
it? No, it's not good.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.364
Sorry, Riley, I should
have seen that thing.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.600
Nice shooting. That's
good shooting, Charlie.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.198
No such thing as nice shooting.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.868
Pretty Boy, what the fuck is going on?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.106
Fireworks are jammed.
We're getting on it.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.704
Shut her down!

10:50.616 --> 10:51.844
Everyone, out of town.

10:52.284 --> 10:54.479
Let's move! Go! Drive!

10:54.587 --> 10:55.918
Go!

11:01.961 --> 11:02.985
Two minutes!

11:03.062 --> 11:04.927
Pretty Boy, lay down some cover.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.124
Get on the guns!

11:29.355 --> 11:32.518
I thought this was going to be a
battle. It's a fucking massacre.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.004
Cholo, we got a problem.
Fireworks are down.

11:54.113 --> 11:57.276
It's nice and peaceful, ain't
it? Cholo, where are you?

11:57.616 --> 12:00.107
I'm just getting some supplies,
some essential supplies...

12:00.186 --> 12:02.177
just like my job description entails.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.518
Nothing in there but booze.
Booze ain't essential.

12:04.623 --> 12:07.456
A jug of good Kentucky goes
for $1,500 back in town.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.824
You've got to get out of there. Cholo?

12:11.330 --> 12:13.059
God damn it!

12:36.122 --> 12:38.283
All right, Foxy, shop
till you drop, baby.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.216
You know it, brother.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.284
Yeah, 'cause getting
them stinking drunk...

12:43.362 --> 12:45.421
is the only way you're gonna get laid.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.000
When's the last time
you got laid? I forget.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.594
Fox, I don't care about love.
All I care about is money.

12:52.671 --> 12:53.729
That's all I want, baby.

12:54.406 --> 12:55.566
Yes.

12:57.643 --> 12:58.940
Foxy!

13:01.647 --> 13:04.343
I can't get a shot. Cholo, hold on.

13:08.988 --> 13:11.684
I got him. Cholo, I got him!

13:25.805 --> 13:28.899
Bro, do me a favor, will you?

13:29.575 --> 13:31.975
Next time, just let me
take the fucking shot.

13:32.111 --> 13:35.171
Fucking cowboy. Stop being a pussy, man.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.640
Yeah, I got what I need.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.424
A little something extra, too.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.460
Nice.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.526
Here, kid, pick that up.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.265
I'm bit. Yeah, you're bit.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.603
Not gonna leave you here.
Gonna get you out of here, okay?

14:35.674 --> 14:38.700
No. I will not become
one of those things.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.802
Riley, step aside.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.473
No, you put that thing away.
Riley, come on. Step aside.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.676
I said put it away.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.939
This is Riley. Cease
fire. Repeat, cease fire.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.175
Let's pack it up. We're
going to call it a night.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.583
Shit happens, right?

17:31.650 --> 17:33.675
Only if you let it, Charlie.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.290
Life goes on at Fiddler's Green...

17:42.361 --> 17:45.421
in the heart of one of America's
oldest and greatest cities.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.995
Bordered on three sides
by mighty rivers...

17:48.067 --> 17:51.468
Fiddler's Green offers luxury
living in the grand old style.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.700
Dine at one of six fine restaurants.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.565
Look for that perfect gift in
our fully-stocked shopping mall.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.871
Man, they sure did used
to make it sound nice.

18:00.512 --> 18:01.672
Still sounds nice to me.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.012
There is a difference between
our place and other places.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.847
If you can appreciate
that difference...

18:06.919 --> 18:08.750
You're not going to be around no more?

18:08.821 --> 18:12.450
You little bitch, you can come up
and party with me any time you want.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.294
I hate going under the river.

18:17.529 --> 18:18.553
Cholo.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.825
Shit. Let's get out of here, Foxy.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.423
Yeah, man. Back off, Riley.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.560
Just back the fuck off
'cause I am not in the mood.

18:24.636 --> 18:27.196
You think that kid was in the
mood? Look, he knew the risk, man.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.797
He took the job like we all
took the job knowing the risk.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.900
Exactly, the job. You know
what the job is, Cholo?

18:31.977 --> 18:33.968
It's to bring things
in that people need.

18:34.046 --> 18:37.209
Not to make a few extra bucks
selling liquor on the street.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.647
What, you're talking about this?

18:38.717 --> 18:40.742
This is for me and my
new friends, to celebrate.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.684
That's what that's for.

18:42.754 --> 18:45.120
A kid died out there
on the street tonight...

18:45.190 --> 18:47.317
so that you can fucking celebrate.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.994
Riley, you know what you remind
me of? You remind me of my old man.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.763
A nice guy. I loved him and
all that but he was a dumbass.

18:55.834 --> 18:58.029
Never went for anything,
so he never had anything.

18:58.103 --> 19:01.766
What do you got, Riley? Nothing.
I'm going to have my own place, man.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.535
My own goddamn place.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.534
You're dreaming, Cholo.
They won't let you in there.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.842
They wouldn't let me in
there. We're the wrong kind.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.575
Yeah, well, we'll see.

19:11.183 --> 19:12.673
Isn't it time?

19:12.784 --> 19:15.912
Isn't it your time? For Fiddler's Green?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.695
DeMora, supplies unit.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.304
What's in them boxes?
Essential supplies.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.067
For Kaufman.

19:44.449 --> 19:46.440
Mark your calendars.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.110
Mr. Kaufman cordially invites...

19:48.187 --> 19:50.178
residents of the Green
to a masked ball...

19:50.255 --> 19:51.847
on the eve of Allhallows.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.722
It is strictly forbidden
to come as you are.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.658
It's expensive. Look at that.

19:56.728 --> 19:57.717
You like it?

19:59.164 --> 20:00.153
I could tell.

20:15.847 --> 20:18.372
Can I ask you to stop, sir?

20:18.450 --> 20:19.712
Quitting time, Deke.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.309
You're going to need
this to get back in.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.116
When I said quitting time,
I meant quitting time.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.021
Hey, baby.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.192
"The only way to the Father,
is through me," sayeth the Lord.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.164
So, Riley, you want to go get a drink?

20:34.233 --> 20:37.532
Just look at me. You can
tell I could use a drink.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.264
You know, Charlie,
why don't you go ahead?

20:41.340 --> 20:43.604
I'll catch up. Where are you going?

20:45.444 --> 20:47.776
I got to see a man about a car.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.544
A car?

21:04.963 --> 21:07.193
All right. Here's the deal.

21:07.532 --> 21:11.400
Rivers protect us on two sides.
Bridges are all blocked up.

21:11.737 --> 21:14.604
The only overland access is
here, called the "Throat."

21:14.673 --> 21:16.140
And these fences go all the way across?

21:16.208 --> 21:18.176
Half a mile, both ways.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.038
Stench. High noon. Shit.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.547
They don't come around
here much anymore.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.213
It's like they've
learned they can't get in.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.683
Take his fucking face off.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.426
How long are you going to
let Kaufman push you around?

21:45.504 --> 21:48.029
You like shining his
shoes, pressing his pants?

21:48.106 --> 21:51.507
He didn't build that
place. He just took it over.

21:51.576 --> 21:54.875
Kept the best for himself, and
left us with a slum to live in.

21:54.946 --> 21:58.074
But if there's enough of us,
if all of you would join up...

21:58.317 --> 22:00.581
we could make this a
fit place to live in.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.984
Dad, look who's here.

22:03.622 --> 22:07.319
Riley Denbo! I used to work with him.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.188
Bringing in toothpicks for the
bastards to pick at their gums.

22:10.262 --> 22:13.129
And food and other stuff, for all of us.

22:13.899 --> 22:16.026
Come in with us, Riley. Both of you.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.565
Together we'd be unstoppable.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.730
No one's unstoppable, Mulligan.

22:20.806 --> 22:23.274
You're worried about being
locked out. Now, you see that?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.503
I can't help but think
we're all locked in.

22:25.577 --> 22:28.205
I'm looking for a world
where there's no fences.

22:28.647 --> 22:32.515
Here. Antibiotics for your boy. Thanks.

22:37.956 --> 22:40.254
You all right, Son? I'm fine, Dad.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.505
Hey, easy, easy, Knipp! Easy.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.905
Mr. DeMora. Mr. Kaufman
isn't home. And I heard...

23:01.213 --> 23:02.339
that.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.448
I called Security. They should be here.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.007
Yeah, I got it.

23:27.873 --> 23:28.862
Where are you?

23:41.386 --> 23:42.580
Oh, shit.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.400
Oh, God, he killed himself.

23:55.567 --> 23:58.661
All right, lady, I need you to
down, okay? Try to keep it together.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.671
Who are you? Are you
Security? No, I'm not Security.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.764
Then, who the hell are you?

24:03.875 --> 24:07.072
I work for Kaufman. All right, lady,
I just need you to calm down, please.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.908
What are you doing with that?

24:08.980 --> 24:11.608
Lady, you know what I
have to do. I'm sorry.

24:11.683 --> 24:12.672
Dad!

24:12.951 --> 24:14.680
He's gonna turn, lady.

24:14.753 --> 24:16.186
No, he won't. Please.

24:16.254 --> 24:17.983
No, he's okay. Please,
we don't have a choice.

24:18.056 --> 24:20.149
Don't make this anymore
difficult than it has to be.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.715
He's gonna turn, don't do this!

24:25.330 --> 24:27.924
What's happening? Shut up.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.704
Hey, kid.

24:53.091 --> 24:55.286
What the hell's going on here?

25:04.569 --> 25:07.436
It's your problem. Clean it up.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.738
Hey, lady, it's okay.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.187
What did you do to my car? What car?

25:30.328 --> 25:33.126
The last car I drove out of
this town was three years ago.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.099
No, I bought a car. It
was right there yesterday.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.361
There were two guys working on it.

25:37.435 --> 25:39.494
There was nobody here this morning.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.870
Son of a bitch.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.304
What happened, Riley?
Did you get fucked?

25:44.376 --> 25:45.570
Come with me.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.377
You got fucked.

25:54.986 --> 25:57.045
¢Ü¢Ü

26:24.182 --> 26:26.810
Roach. Hey, how's it going?

26:26.985 --> 26:28.782
I've been better. Where's Chihuahua?

26:28.853 --> 26:30.377
Around the back.

26:32.357 --> 26:33.551
Come on!

26:33.625 --> 26:36.719
Lot of action in here today.
We've got a new kind of game.

26:36.828 --> 26:39.422
What are they betting on? Black and red.

26:39.497 --> 26:41.829
Who wins the fight.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.400
Stenches don't fight.

26:43.468 --> 26:44.901
They do when there's food.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.562
What's on the menu, cat or dog?

26:46.638 --> 26:49.129
I told you, today it's something new.

26:49.841 --> 26:53.174
Who do you want, black
or red? $60 on black.

27:26.878 --> 27:28.869
What the fuck happened to my car?

27:28.947 --> 27:30.471
They're fixing it up.

27:30.548 --> 27:33.449
No, I went to the garage.
There's nothing there.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.986
Your guys aren't there,
and my car is not there.

27:36.054 --> 27:40.150
This is not me. I do not do
this to you. I'm your friend.

27:40.225 --> 27:42.318
Well, be my friend and
get my fucking car back...

27:42.394 --> 27:45.522
or I'll have to carry you out
of here inside that fucking hat.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.406
This guy could be
trouble. Keep him busy.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.902
Give a drink.

28:03.281 --> 28:05.044
Let me have my gun.

28:14.325 --> 28:15.758
Supply run last night, huh?

28:15.827 --> 28:17.795
I heard you got some
money. Not interested.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.887
I'll show you how to turn
that money into more...

28:19.964 --> 28:21.158
I said I'm not interested.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.647
Jesus! Fuck!

29:06.878 --> 29:08.743
My suit.

29:09.547 --> 29:11.777
He ruined my fucking suit!

29:51.289 --> 29:52.381
Shit.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.887
I'm all right.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.136
Thank you. Thank you.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.501
I've seen you around.

30:14.579 --> 30:17.639
I've seen you around,
too, working the streets.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.309
You were checking me out?

30:25.123 --> 30:26.818
What the hell happened here?

30:26.891 --> 30:29.883
Someone shot the little
fat man. I see that.

30:30.195 --> 30:31.253
You're under arrest.

30:39.437 --> 30:40.426
Hey.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.563
What? Why you?

30:42.640 --> 30:46.440
Why'd the little fat man throw
you in there with them things?

30:47.412 --> 30:49.107
Wasn't the little man.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.339
It was the big man.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.982
Mr. K.

30:55.453 --> 30:58.081
He's got his fingers in everything here.

30:58.223 --> 31:00.748
If you can drink it, shoot it up...

31:00.959 --> 31:05.658
fuck it, gamble on
it, it belongs to him.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.690
Didn't answer the question.

31:09.734 --> 31:12.134
He asked you why. I
know what he asked me.

31:16.908 --> 31:21.106
They found out I was helping
out Mulligan and his people...

31:21.813 --> 31:24.611
tired of eating bones
while he's having a steak.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.514
Me, too, but every place is the same.

31:27.852 --> 31:29.615
Places with people.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.352
I'm going to find a place
where there's no people.

31:32.423 --> 31:33.412
North.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.285
Canada. If you get a way out...

31:37.528 --> 31:41.191
I'm coming with you. No,
Riley likes to be alone.

31:41.366 --> 31:44.392
He might take me, 'cause he says...

31:44.502 --> 31:48.063
having me around is pretty
much the same as being alone.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.500
And 'cause I can make myself
useful, and I can shoot.

31:53.578 --> 31:57.070
I can shoot. I can be
pretty fucking useful.

31:58.116 --> 32:02.519
I had training. I was going to
join the army, help the Green...

32:02.754 --> 32:05.985
till somebody figured I'd be
a better hooker than a soldier.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.150
You know, I don't want to
hear your fucking story.

32:08.226 --> 32:12.060
Everyone's got a story, and
I am sick of hearing them.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.889
What's your story, Riley?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.162
I don't have one.

32:17.235 --> 32:21.103
Nothing bad ever happened to
me till everything changed.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.603
Everything changed for all of us.

32:33.484 --> 32:34.781
Hey, Mulligan.

32:40.591 --> 32:43.856
What they going to do?
Kill him? Not right away.

32:44.595 --> 32:48.895
First they'll try to get him
to talk. About people like me.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.783
Mr. DeMora. Boss.

34:16.987 --> 34:19.286
How was Uniontown? Dead.

34:20.291 --> 34:23.783
Death intrudes on us even
here in the city, I'm afraid.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.155
I heard abut what
happened with my neighbors.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.629
And I'm grateful for your help.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.222
That's what I'm here for, boss...

34:29.300 --> 34:31.268
to take care of any problems you got.

34:31.335 --> 34:34.771
Look, I got you a little present,
a little souvenir from town.

34:41.446 --> 34:43.437
I know you're used to
better vintage than this...

34:43.514 --> 34:44.775
but it's the best we got.

34:44.849 --> 34:47.112
Little champers to take
the edge off things.

34:49.554 --> 34:50.953
There we go.

34:55.059 --> 34:58.392
This is very extravagant.
Yeah, well, I can afford it.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.825
With the $20,000 you
owe me from last night...

35:01.899 --> 35:03.958
and the money from all the
other nights together...

35:04.035 --> 35:05.969
I got enough for my own place.

35:06.370 --> 35:09.271
You mean here in the
Green? Sure, why not?

35:11.976 --> 35:13.910
I'm sorry, Mr. DeMora...

35:15.713 --> 35:18.045
but there's a very long waiting list.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.447
How long? Well...

35:21.886 --> 35:24.719
this is an extremely desirable location.

35:25.323 --> 35:26.984
Space is very limited.

35:27.258 --> 35:28.691
You mean restricted, don't you?

35:28.759 --> 35:30.386
I do have a board of directors...

35:30.461 --> 35:32.656
and I have a membership committee.

35:34.332 --> 35:38.996
They have to approve.
Don't do this to me. Don't.

35:40.004 --> 35:42.802
How long have I been
working for you? Three years?

35:42.874 --> 35:45.672
Taking out your garbage,
cleaning up after you...

35:45.943 --> 35:48.343
and then you're going to
say I'm not good enough?

35:48.412 --> 35:51.108
Let me tell you something,
you're going to let me in...

35:51.182 --> 35:52.843
because I know what goes on around here.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.145
Do your committee members know...

35:54.218 --> 35:56.152
what the fuck is going
out with the garbage?

35:57.221 --> 35:59.587
So, you're gonna let me in, you hear me?

36:00.525 --> 36:03.289
Maybe we could talk about this
when you're a little less excited.

36:21.812 --> 36:24.372
I won't be needing this man anymore.

36:48.105 --> 36:50.130
Take that, you scary zombie.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.808
...come back to God.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.606
Give up your lives of sin.

36:55.079 --> 36:58.242
Praise the Lord! Father is the only way.

36:58.916 --> 37:00.884
Come back to Jesus.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.950
Fox, get the guys. We're going out.

37:06.624 --> 37:10.321
Want me to call Riley? Forget
Riley. Just us. Come on.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.324
Thanks.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.364
Shit, man. You win. You
got him right in the brain.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.963
That's right. Double or nothing.

37:26.777 --> 37:29.507
Brubaker, who'd you blow
to get this cushy job?

37:29.580 --> 37:31.878
Cholo, you bum, how's it going?

37:32.049 --> 37:35.041
Where's Riley? He's retired.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.245
We're taking the truck out.

37:38.022 --> 37:41.014
That's from yesterday.
What? You're shitting me.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.026
I'm gonna quit drinking, man.

37:45.730 --> 37:48.858
What the hell is that? Relax.
It's just target practice.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.026
Barrett, stop scratching
around back there.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.399
You're going to fuck up my shot.

37:52.503 --> 37:55.700
I'm not doing nothing,
man, I'm just standing here.

38:10.721 --> 38:12.382
There's nothing there, man.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.994
So, what the hell is
that, screaming practice?

38:17.061 --> 38:18.688
Stenches! They're all over the place.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.326
Let's make our move. Come on.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.335
All right, go.

38:38.349 --> 38:39.373
Their eyes.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.216
Mouse, take that.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.084
Cholo, should we send
up some sky flowers?

38:47.158 --> 38:48.182
It ain't our fight, Fox.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.386
The stenches want to get
in, let them in. Come on.

38:52.363 --> 38:54.297
Everybody, get busy.

39:02.473 --> 39:04.839
That's our way out. Should
we do something about this?

39:04.909 --> 39:07.036
That's our way out, get us there.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.513
No.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.048
Get out of here!

39:24.362 --> 39:26.091
No!

40:23.988 --> 40:25.455
Kaufman.

40:25.790 --> 40:27.087
The one that got away.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.625
That's right.

40:29.059 --> 40:31.994
Remember you said we should
talk when I was less excited?

40:32.062 --> 40:33.791
I'm a lot less excited right now.

40:33.864 --> 40:35.491
What do you want, Mr. DeMora?

40:35.766 --> 40:38.758
You might have noticed that
I had to leave in a hurry...

40:38.836 --> 40:41.771
so I didn't get a chance to
take my money out of your bank.

40:41.839 --> 40:43.966
I'd like you to handle
that withdrawal for me.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.976
With interest: $5 million.

40:47.478 --> 40:50.504
Or I'm gonna blow you out
of your fucking castle.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.173
Because I got Dead Reckoning.

40:52.817 --> 40:54.375
That's unfortunate.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.886
Well, unfortunate for you, perhaps.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.122
I want you to put
that money on a boat...

40:59.190 --> 41:02.421
and send it across the river to
the South Side, 10th Street Pier.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.461
One man to drive the boat, no more.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.888
You have till midnight,
that's two and a half hours.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.194
I won't be there, and Dead
Reckoning won't be there.

41:09.266 --> 41:12.394
But I'll know if it happens, and
I'll know if it doesn't happen.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.562
Copy?

41:18.075 --> 41:19.269
Trouble?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.638
In a world where the dead
are returning to life...

41:21.779 --> 41:24.748
the world "trouble"
loses much of its meaning.

41:25.282 --> 41:27.910
He wants money. Pay him.

41:28.085 --> 41:30.519
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.355
We have other options.

41:36.193 --> 41:38.423
Denbo. Give me Denbo.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.461
Get up. You're coming with me.

41:44.535 --> 41:47.436
Where you taking him? Don't worry.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.530
Where are you taking him?

41:55.446 --> 41:58.415
You take care of him? Hell, yeah.

42:00.484 --> 42:03.578
He pulled me out of the fire.

42:04.555 --> 42:05.920
It was bad.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.855
Just look at me, you
can tell it was bad.

42:18.702 --> 42:22.695
Mr. Denbo, can I offer you a drink?

42:22.773 --> 42:25.640
I don't drink. Why am I here?

42:26.210 --> 42:29.304
We want you to repossess a
vehicle that belongs to us...

42:29.380 --> 42:31.780
a vehicle that you designed, Mr. Denbo.

42:31.849 --> 42:34.875
Dead Reckoning has been stolen
by your second-in-command...

42:34.952 --> 42:36.977
who I want captured or killed...

42:37.054 --> 42:40.353
and I want my $2 million
piece of equipment returned.

42:40.424 --> 42:41.686
My truck.

42:42.326 --> 42:45.625
My truck, which has guns.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.386
Powerful guns.

42:47.598 --> 42:49.031
It'll do a great deal of damage...

42:49.099 --> 42:51.226
if they're aimed at this city.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.236
Why don't you just send out your troops?

42:53.304 --> 42:55.363
I can send 50 men against that thing...

42:55.439 --> 42:59.068
and they'd come back in body
bags. Now, Cholo was your man.

42:59.176 --> 43:02.737
Maybe you can get close enough
to do what has to be done.

43:03.814 --> 43:06.305
It's a good thing I'm still in town.

43:07.551 --> 43:09.314
See, I bought a car.

43:09.553 --> 43:12.078
I was going to drive out
of here, but it disappeared.

43:12.156 --> 43:14.147
I guess someone didn't want me to leave.

43:14.224 --> 43:16.249
You're a very popular man.

43:20.731 --> 43:23.495
How much are your
services going to cost me?

43:23.567 --> 43:27.128
A vehicle, enough weapons
and ammunition to go north.

43:27.571 --> 43:30.563
But there's nothing up
north. That's the idea.

43:31.408 --> 43:33.876
There's one more thing: My
friends, they go with me.

43:33.944 --> 43:35.275
Take them.

43:37.581 --> 43:41.176
Can you find Dead Reckoning, quickly?

43:41.251 --> 43:43.048
How quickly? Midnight.

43:44.088 --> 43:45.555
I have a way.

43:49.860 --> 43:51.919
Mouse, there are three
things a man must do alone:

43:51.996 --> 43:54.897
Be born, die, and we all
know the other one, don't we?

43:54.965 --> 43:57.490
Yeah, okay, Cholo. Just don't
leave me here alone too long...

43:57.568 --> 44:00.298
Two hours max. Give me a call.
Let me know if we're rich or not.

44:00.371 --> 44:01.497
All right, two hours.

44:01.572 --> 44:03.164
Give him something for the nerves.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.231
Something for the nerves.

44:07.011 --> 44:08.911
Stay real. Okay.

45:35.999 --> 45:37.796
¢Ü¢Ü

45:42.106 --> 45:45.940
Can't believe you guys are turning
me into a fucking boy scout.

45:47.478 --> 45:48.809
Not a boy.

45:49.079 --> 45:51.343
You don't have to come
out if you don't want to.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.076
I didn't say that.

45:53.917 --> 45:58.183
Some shit, though, going
out to save Kaufman's ass.

45:58.422 --> 45:59.855
I'm not doing this for Kaufman.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.220
This is for the people in the city.

46:01.291 --> 46:04.954
What do you think's going to happen
to them if Cholo shells the Green?

46:05.028 --> 46:07.019
Okay. I'm with you.

46:08.565 --> 46:10.760
No, I like the ones I already got.

46:10.834 --> 46:13.325
This piece fires 14 rounds a second.

46:14.238 --> 46:16.536
I don't normally need that many.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.107
I don't normally talk to retards.

46:23.847 --> 46:25.974
Pretty easy to make
fun of some people, huh?

46:26.049 --> 46:28.882
I could make a whole
lot of fun out of you.

46:30.154 --> 46:31.883
I'll take this one.

46:34.358 --> 46:35.882
He thinks he's taking care of you.

46:35.959 --> 46:36.983
He does.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.755
Without his guns, I'd be dead by now.

46:38.829 --> 46:41.161
Without you, he'd be dead by now.

46:41.565 --> 46:42.623
Fair trade.

46:42.699 --> 46:45.964
Riley, these guys are coming.

46:47.271 --> 46:49.398
Gentlemen and lady.

46:50.007 --> 46:52.202
Mr. Kaufman thought you
could use some support.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.870
Don't need any. Nevertheless. Manolete.

46:55.045 --> 46:58.105
Manolete, named after the bullfighter.

46:58.882 --> 47:01.942
Monica. You can call me Motown.

47:03.253 --> 47:04.584
Pillsbury.

47:08.158 --> 47:11.525
I'm here to do something.
Why are we standing around?

47:12.296 --> 47:13.820
Let's do something.

47:17.835 --> 47:18.859
We taking the jeep?

47:18.936 --> 47:20.801
The Woody. It's bigger, has guns.

47:25.742 --> 47:30.145
Jeez. Cholo made a mess.
No. Cholo didn't do all this.

47:30.781 --> 47:33.272
This is stenches. A lot of them.

47:33.884 --> 47:35.511
Maybe still here.

47:38.422 --> 47:40.822
That's where they came in. Look.

47:40.891 --> 47:42.449
That's where they went out.

47:42.526 --> 47:46.018
Trying to get to the city.
I'm going to go get the ammo.

47:46.096 --> 47:48.223
Crank up the Woody, Charlie.

47:48.966 --> 47:50.433
Make sure she doesn't hurt herself.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.092
I can take care of myself, okay?

47:52.169 --> 47:55.400
Fine. Charlie, make sure
she doesn't hurt anyone else.

47:55.472 --> 47:57.133
You, come with me.

48:01.311 --> 48:02.972
Walkers, Mr. Denbo?

48:03.046 --> 48:04.775
And moving toward the city.

48:04.848 --> 48:07.646
They'll never get across the
river. I wouldn't be so sure.

48:08.118 --> 48:09.847
They learned how to work together.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.820
They're mindless walking corpses...

48:11.889 --> 48:13.083
and many of us will be, too...

48:13.156 --> 48:15.784
if you don't stay focused
on the task at hand.

48:16.994 --> 48:20.122
Zombies, man. They creep me out.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.691
Do you really think they
can get across the water?

48:22.766 --> 48:25.030
If you asked me that a week
ago, I would have said no.

48:25.102 --> 48:26.467
But now...

48:27.504 --> 48:30.371
One way or the other, we got to
get our hands on Dead Reckoning.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.670
There's more of them out there.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.708
I can hear them.
They're always out there.

48:36.480 --> 48:39.711
You're all right? Yeah, no problem.

48:49.993 --> 48:51.620
Woody's in there.

49:07.244 --> 49:11.305
Who's got the keys, guys?
No keys to get. Melted.

49:11.715 --> 49:15.151
Screw the keys. Let's just
hot-wire the fucking thing.

49:23.794 --> 49:24.988
Yellow to red.

49:25.062 --> 49:28.225
What the fuck does a Samoan know
about hot-wiring a fucking car?

49:28.298 --> 49:31.358
Fifty thousand cars
stolen in Samoa every year.

49:31.468 --> 49:33.868
Yeah? Well, a million in Detroit.

49:33.937 --> 49:36.167
Detroit's got 50 million cars.

49:36.239 --> 49:40.039
Samoa: 50,000. Every one stolen.

49:45.449 --> 49:46.973
Charlie.

49:47.751 --> 49:51.050
Why do you lick your
rifle? It catches the light.

49:53.557 --> 49:56.549
What light? How can you see anything?

49:56.760 --> 49:58.022
Good eye.

50:00.897 --> 50:01.955
Hey.

50:02.966 --> 50:04.194
Charlie?

50:05.602 --> 50:06.728
Shit!

50:11.875 --> 50:13.900
Off-center, but I got him.

50:15.712 --> 50:16.940
Awesome, man.

50:23.854 --> 50:26.379
Got a flashlight? Yeah.

50:38.301 --> 50:39.893
Brubaker?

50:46.710 --> 50:48.200
Hey, Brubaker?

50:50.714 --> 50:52.477
Brubaker, you there?

50:53.850 --> 50:55.374
Hear that? Yeah.

51:13.470 --> 51:16.030
All right, keep that thing
shining. Let's get ammo.

51:16.106 --> 51:18.768
There's.50 caliber
around here somewhere.

51:18.842 --> 51:20.639
Great. Here's the.50.

51:33.056 --> 51:34.523
Jesus Christ.

51:45.335 --> 51:48.304
No, not in here. Think
about where we are.

51:49.072 --> 51:50.562
Take a breath.

51:52.342 --> 51:54.003
Choose your shots.

52:25.041 --> 52:27.202
We're even. Not.

52:27.944 --> 52:30.572
That hurt. I didn't hurt you.

52:34.851 --> 52:36.216
I got it.

52:47.597 --> 52:48.825
Oh, God.

52:59.643 --> 53:01.304
Is he bit? Yeah.

53:03.380 --> 53:04.404
Go!

53:32.342 --> 53:34.207
How long does he have?

53:35.779 --> 53:39.943
Had a little brother bit. He took
less than an hour before he turned.

53:40.917 --> 53:42.817
And then what happened?

53:44.120 --> 53:45.485
I shot him.

53:47.757 --> 53:49.952
You said nothing bad
ever happened to you.

53:50.026 --> 53:52.153
That happened to my brother.

53:53.463 --> 53:56.364
Yeah. Dead is dead.

54:00.637 --> 54:03.128
And that ain't you or me.

54:09.946 --> 54:12.437
I'm sorry. No! No!

54:30.433 --> 54:32.958
I recognize that some
of you are concerned...

54:33.036 --> 54:35.027
and I wanna assure you...

54:35.472 --> 54:38.908
that if anything goes wrong,
measures have been taken.

54:39.175 --> 54:42.440
I've established outposts
with food and supplies...

54:42.512 --> 54:44.810
that will support us on our way.

54:45.015 --> 54:48.178
On our way to where?
Anywhere that we want to go.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.845
Alternative sites have been
chosen for us and our families...

54:50.920 --> 54:53.946
as well as necessary support personnel.

54:54.024 --> 54:55.514
What about all the others?

54:55.592 --> 54:57.457
All the others can
be replaced by others.

54:57.527 --> 54:59.722
Boss. You're interrupting me, Bill.

55:00.096 --> 55:01.324
It's bad timing.

55:01.431 --> 55:04.992
Just when I was talking about
how people can be replaced.

55:05.135 --> 55:08.696
A day may come when you earn
yourself some responsibilities.

55:08.772 --> 55:11.002
But right now the
responsibilities are mine.

55:11.074 --> 55:12.701
They're all mine.

55:12.942 --> 55:15.467
It was my ingenuity
that took an old world...

55:15.545 --> 55:17.410
and made it into something new.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.971
I put up the fences to make it safe.

55:20.116 --> 55:23.279
I hired the soldiers and
paid for their training.

55:23.353 --> 55:28.017
I kept the people off the streets
by giving them games and vices...

55:28.458 --> 55:30.221
which cost me money.

55:30.293 --> 55:32.659
But I spend it because
the responsibility is mine.

55:32.729 --> 55:36.529
Now, do you understand the
meaning of the word responsibility?

55:37.701 --> 55:40.431
We have to do what we have to do.

55:43.540 --> 55:46.134
Foxy, I know I'm never gonna be great.

55:46.209 --> 55:48.336
I'm never gonna be on the
list of names of people...

55:48.411 --> 55:51.039
who done great things
because I don't do anything.

55:51.114 --> 55:52.604
Not one thing.

55:54.050 --> 55:56.416
If it wasn't for this truck,
I wouldn't be any different...

55:56.486 --> 55:58.283
than that poor Mexican
bastard out there.

55:58.355 --> 56:00.789
Cholo, look, Kaufman might not pay.

56:01.157 --> 56:02.886
Kaufman's gonna pay, man.

56:02.959 --> 56:06.417
But if he doesn't, he knows
I'm gonna do a jihad on his ass.

56:28.084 --> 56:30.279
When you hit Route 6, take a right.

56:30.353 --> 56:32.651
How do you know which way to go?

56:33.156 --> 56:35.317
Homing device. Cool.

56:45.535 --> 56:47.730
How long since you been out here?

56:47.804 --> 56:49.567
I've never been out.

56:50.974 --> 56:55.070
I've lived in the city
since it was a real city.

56:57.781 --> 56:59.112
Pull over.

57:03.052 --> 57:04.815
Cover them, Charlie.

57:05.789 --> 57:08.815
All right, you're working for
Kaufman, I'm working for Kaufman.

57:08.892 --> 57:10.325
My job is to stop Cholo.

57:10.393 --> 57:14.887
Your job is to bring the truck
back, with or without me, right?

57:14.964 --> 57:17.762
Not without you, no.
Well, that means yes.

57:17.834 --> 57:19.096
Here's what's going to happen.

57:19.169 --> 57:22.195
I'm going to do my job. You're
not going to get to do yours.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.934
Kaufman is never going to
see Dead Reckoning again.

57:25.008 --> 57:28.068
And when I get it, I'm
gonna do what I want with it.

57:28.144 --> 57:31.944
Anyone has any problems with
that, you can get out right here.

57:33.249 --> 57:36.343
Some choice. No choice. Close door.

57:38.188 --> 57:40.452
Keep them covered, Charlie. Wait.

57:40.523 --> 57:42.252
You made us come all the way out here...

57:42.325 --> 57:44.156
just to steal a fucking truck?

57:44.227 --> 57:45.785
You made a deal, Riley.

57:45.862 --> 57:48.126
You're going back on a deal.
You never done that before.

57:48.198 --> 57:50.428
If Cholo shells the
Green, all deals are off.

57:51.701 --> 57:53.896
If something worse happens,
I don't know about you...

57:53.970 --> 57:56.768
but I don't want to be out
here in a car without a roof.

58:06.950 --> 58:08.918
Mouse, you got anything?

58:09.185 --> 58:11.415
No boat, no money, no nothing.

58:19.462 --> 58:21.191
Load the six-packs.

58:25.368 --> 58:26.858
¢Ü¢Ü

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.805
Six-pack loaded.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:22.112
All right, load the other six.

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:25.253
We're not gonna show
them any goddamn mercy.

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:34.123
I know where Cholo's going. Where?

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.597
Mount Washington, overlooks the city.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:37.860
We can beat him there.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.902
In that truck, he's
gotta take the main roads.

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.130
We can take the back streets. Right.

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.571
Make a right on lvy, then
take a left on Westminster.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.973
You wanna go up the hill?
Yes, I'm wanna go up the hill.

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.840
Let's go up the hill.

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:03.813
Almost midnight, sir.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.513
Pack us up. We might be leaving.

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:06.612
In the boat?

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:08.316
I'd rather be taking Dead Reckoning...

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.052
but not available.

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:29.103
From this hillside,
they can shell the Green.

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:31.237
They're gonna be coming up this road.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.339
Pull in around the corner.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.355
All right, they're coming.

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.396
You guys stay here and keep real quiet.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.523
I'm going to try and talk my way inside.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.759
He's going to steal that
truck and leave us here.

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.326
Riley would never do that.

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:30.497
Just look at him, you can
tell he'd never do that.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:33.167
I like that man. You, go help him.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.166
Go.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.022
Everything's okay back there.

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:55.924
It's too late to send me back.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.494
Now, put that thing away.

01:03:57.567 --> 01:04:00.764
Put on your best Sunday smile,
and just try to look friendly.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.327
I am friendly.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.770
Hey, Cholo. Take a look at this.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.834
It's Denbo and his idiot.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.537
All right. Stop the truck.

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.373
Come on, here.

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.857
So, how did you get
up here? In the Woody.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.222
I tracked you with this.

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.317
Forgot to tell you...

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.487
the truck's got a little
transmitter in her belly.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:29.224
You were always a smart guy.

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:31.095
Always a lot smarter than me, man.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.429
That's not saying much.

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.369
Open up. What, are you fucking nuts?

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:36.666
Open up.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.019
Hey, Charlie.

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:56.482
So, who's the smart one now?

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.787
Thought you would have quit...

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.488
but here you are still working
for the man, aren't you, Riley?

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.497
What? Kaufman sent you
up to take care of me?

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.657
Yeah.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.961
Takes a true friend to stab you
right in the front, doesn't it?

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:09.533
That man pulls the trigger, he's dead.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.508
Who else is out there?

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:19.411
Kaufman sent some guys with
us. We took care of them.

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.452
Cover him.

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:29.419
Pretty Boy, lock in the target.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:45.806
We're running out of time.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.698
I got you now.

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:56.010
You hit that tower square on...

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:57.909
you're gonna kill a
lot of innocent people.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.245
You miss, you hit the city, you're
gonna kill a lot of our friends.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:02.841
Want to know who killed our friends?

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:05.011
Kaufman is the one
that's killed our friends.

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.954
Every time I took out his garbage,
I took out one of our friends...

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.651
people he wanted off the streets.

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:12.057
He turned me into a goon, then
he's gonna piss all over me?

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:13.152
I don't think so.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.335
What are you gonna
get out of this, Cholo?

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:24.701
Hopefully my money.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.972
Money burns. Yeah,
not if it's in a vault.

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:36.376
All right, Mr. K., won't
be needing you anymore.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.860
You set this right? Yes.

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.921
Riley, you did something to it
with your fucking little toy.

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:52.593
This? What the fuck did you do? Fix it.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.568
Fix it. Not a fucking chance.

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:07.479
Cholo, look out.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:30.796
Fuck.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.104
You know, Riley...

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.615
there's something about you
that I've always really hated.

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.743
You're still here, aren't
you? What do you care?

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.310
You got what you wanted. You're hit.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:47.886
How you doing in there, Charlie?

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.685
I'm being friendly.

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:56.453
What's in the bags? Money.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.265
Whose money?

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:02.359
Watch out. Get down. Quick.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:05.031
Ours.

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:11.005
Yes? We got Cholo.

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:15.178
Kaufman. I'm here.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.585
I just did something...

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.986
I might not have done otherwise.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.055
You lied to me, Denbo.

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:34.625
You didn't get DeMora.
He's shooting at us.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.495
That's not Cholo, Mr. Kaufman.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:42.108
Holy shit. They got across the river.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.304
Look at that.

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:44.970
I didn't even have to blow the place up.

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:46.514
The fucking stenches did it for me.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.625
We're going back to the city to
see if we can help. Pick him up.

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.319
Where we going, man? What are we doing?

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:01.488
Easy, Gargantua, come
on. Get him inside. Quick.

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.860
Not this horse. Not this horse.

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.633
Take that Woody if you still got it.

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.499
Fine. You got me, too.

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:10.565
Thanks.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.639
Anyone else?

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:16.971
Where you gonna go, Cholo?

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.946
There's always that
outpost in Cleveland.

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.175
Haven't heard from them in a while.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.683
Take my chances.

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.215
You have no right.

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:29.883
No right.

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:33.693
Woody's around the corner.
Guns and ammo inside.

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:34.956
Thanks.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:37.465
Get us back on the main road.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.302
You have blood, here.
We almost lost you there.

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:47.437
You all right? Yeah.

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.807
You want to be really
helpful, roll me one.

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:51.402
Yeah, all right.

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:34.317
What was built to keep people
safe is gonna trap them inside.

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:38.818
This is Denbo in the Reckoning.

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.828
Open up those fences
and let the people out.

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:43.160
The fences are still hot. We
can't cut the juice from here.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:44.893
We've been trying to
call the power station.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.195
There's no one left over there.

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:47.735
We got to get the fuck out of here.

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.167
There's no one left here, either.

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.466
Move it.

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:55.975
We can rocket those fences.

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.410
Got to get across river.

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.811
The bridges into the city,
they're all bricked up.

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.611
Let's just fucking
blast our way through.

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:02.742
No, we can't do that.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:05.651
There's a war going on over there.
We cross any of these bridges...

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:07.552
we're gonna end up right
in the middle of it.

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:09.557
We have to come in
outside of the Throat.

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.128
Somehow, Fox, I thought
we'd be traveling...

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:16.255
in a lot better style than this, baby.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.391
At least we're still
fucking traveling, brother.

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:20.660
What?

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.783
Come on, Fox, let's get
the hell out of here.

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:56.429
What?

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.740
Can you fucking believe it?

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:04.176
Nothing works out the
way you want it to.

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:07.738
There's something always comes
around the corner and just gets you.

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.453
It's your choice, bro.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:20.720
I always wanted to see
how the other half lives.

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:26.796
The old J&L can take us over.

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.359
It's a drawbridge. They leave it up.

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:30.428
That means it's not guarded.
Can you get us there?

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:31.530
Yeah. Let's go.

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:58.516
I can stay with you, if you want.

01:15:58.587 --> 01:15:59.781
No. No.

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:02.318
This is between me and the man.

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.024
Fox, she's all yours.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:11.031
Hope you do better than
you did with me, man.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.692
Yeah.

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:51.365
Holy shit!

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:54.101
A disturbance has been reported...

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:55.438
on the outskirts of the city.

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.000
There's no reason to believe...

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.343
that Fiddler's Green
could ever be compromised.

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:03.680
But we suggest that residents report
any sightings of unusual behavior.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:12.386
There it is. Let's hope it's
still wired into the grid.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.353
Shut the hatch, just in case.

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:21.521
When I get the bridge
down, you come pick me up.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.801
How do you work this thing?
It's just like a video game.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.507
What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.412
Making myself useful.

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.527
Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop!

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:23.919
Stenches.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:26.858
Starboard.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.999
They're behind us, too.

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:41.904
I can't get a shot.

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:08.399
Now shoot!

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.525
They'll never get in
here. Neither will Riley.

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:41.398
Unlock the roof hatch, Pretty Boy.

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.069
Oh, shit.

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.900
Riley, go for the roof. Okay.

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.250
Roll!

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.663
What are you doing? Forward!

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:10.993
I'm gonna shake these bastards.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:01.514
Get out of the way.

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:04.278
Hello?

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:05.746
Hello?

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.158
What is it? Is something going on?

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.716
Stenches!

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.133
We're fucked.

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.165
Angle the mortars for the Throat...

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.074
and send up some sky flowers.

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:31.874
Got her!

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:50.787
Oh, thank God.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.304
Watch it now.

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:32.604
Oh, my God.

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.905
Downstairs. The car.

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:44.014
You bastards! You have no right!

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:52.021
Mr. Kaufman, come on, let's go.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.896
Mr. Kaufman wants you to know...

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.562
All right, we're going to the boat.

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.663
...he has dedicated
himself to your well-being.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.298
Be careful when you open that door.

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:10.469
Should I call the crew,
sir? No, I'll call them.

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.062
God damn it.

01:24:35.503 --> 01:24:36.993
What the fuck?

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:52.410
Goodbye, Mr. K.

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:55.547
Come back here, you son of a
bitch. You got the fucking keys.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.373
Fucking spic bastard.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.497
Nah. You're dead.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.709
Oh, my God. You are dead.

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.541
Number 1's clear. Going for Number 2.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.239
I don't normally need that many.

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.373
Don't bother. Come on down.

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:13.147
Blow the fences.

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:47.683
Sky flowers don't work no more.

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:50.851
Shoot.

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:53.755
But there's people.

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:56.926
Those people are all
dead. Shoot, Charlie.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.982
We're too late.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.051
No.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:29.488
Look.

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.072
You saved them.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.900
You staying or leaving?

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:09.861
You? Leaving.

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:12.368
Unless you need my help. No.

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.035
Why don't you stick around?

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:16.838
We could turn this place into
what we always wanted it to be.

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.071
Maybe.

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:22.276
Then what will we turn
into? We'll see, won't we?

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:30.613
You want to go to Canada now, Riley?

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:33.088
Sure, if no one has any objections.

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.254
No, we'll take you with us.

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:37.792
I'll try to make myself useful.

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:41.358
Anchor, load the guns.
We're hitting the road.

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:56.739
Now we can go.

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:34.345
No.

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:37.283
They're just looking for a place to go.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.925
Same as us.

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:46.798
Fire off what's left inside those tubes.

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:49.166
We're not gonna need it anymore.

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.237
Take us north.

01:32:02.305 --> 01:32:08.848
