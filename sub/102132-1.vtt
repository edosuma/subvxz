00:02.629 --> 00:05.379
(dramatic music)

00:10.067 --> 00:13.067
(crickets chirping)

00:25.941 --> 00:28.858
(thunder rumbling)

00:39.675 --> 00:42.175
(crow cawing)

00:46.398 --> 00:49.315
(thunder rumbling)

00:52.839 --> 00:57.839
(crow cawing)
(thunder rumbling)

01:01.288 --> 01:02.371
- This is it.

01:06.129 --> 01:08.296
Here, hold the flashlight.

01:09.409 --> 01:12.326
(mysterious music)

01:19.930 --> 01:21.280
Whoa.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.113
We're in.

01:22.113 --> 01:24.980
- Oh yeah, whoa, we're in.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.563
A barn.

01:27.940 --> 01:28.773
What?

01:28.773 --> 01:30.062
It's an old barn.

01:30.062 --> 01:32.562
Do you really expect me
to get excited about this?

01:33.980 --> 01:34.940
- Come on, babe.

01:34.940 --> 01:36.600
This is where it all happened.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.780
Those murders back in the 80s.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.490
(groaning)

01:40.490 --> 01:42.840
Corpses and body parts everywhere.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.440
And they never found the killer.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.750
- And I suppose we're the first ones

01:47.750 --> 01:49.913
to set foot in here ever since.

01:51.470 --> 01:52.460
- You know what, Penny?

01:52.460 --> 01:55.442
You can be a real pain
in the ass sometimes.

01:55.442 --> 01:59.180
(mysterious music)

01:59.180 --> 02:01.180
Look, we'll have a quick look around,

02:01.180 --> 02:03.550
and if we don't find
anything cool, we can leave.

02:03.550 --> 02:04.610
Okay?

02:04.610 --> 02:05.760
- Fine, Rod.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.593
If it gets it out of your system...

02:08.670 --> 02:11.587
(mysterious music)

03:07.131 --> 03:10.908
I suppose you want to climb
up there and check it out?

03:10.908 --> 03:12.075
- You said it.

03:13.870 --> 03:15.150
Not!

03:15.150 --> 03:16.350
That's obviously rotted wood.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.873
What do you think I am, stupid?

03:21.490 --> 03:23.180
Let's just go check out the house.

03:23.180 --> 03:24.013
- Okay.

03:25.361 --> 03:28.278
(mysterious music)

03:32.832 --> 03:35.332
(tense music)

03:40.388 --> 03:42.638
(laughing)

03:44.270 --> 03:47.080
The inside of this
place is disgusting too.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.410
- What do you expect?

03:48.410 --> 03:51.005
No one's been here in decades.

03:51.005 --> 03:53.922
(mysterious music)

04:22.264 --> 04:26.204
- Well, I suppose they
don't get Wi-Fi here.

04:26.204 --> 04:29.890
(mysterious music)

04:29.890 --> 04:31.533
Wait, point it back in that direction.

04:33.704 --> 04:35.240
I thought you said this
place was abandoned.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.600
Someone's been here.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.040
- It was probably just
a drifter off the street

04:39.040 --> 04:42.313
who needed a place to stay
and stayed here and then left.

04:43.220 --> 04:46.410
- Why didn't they dust off
the couch and sleep there?

04:46.410 --> 04:47.807
- Beats me.

04:47.807 --> 04:48.900
- I don't like this.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.560
Maybe we should go.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.900
- Let's just look around a little longer.

04:53.942 --> 04:56.859
(mysterious music)

05:26.552 --> 05:27.971
(squeaking)

05:27.971 --> 05:29.040
- Oh my God.

05:29.040 --> 05:29.935
What was that?

05:29.935 --> 05:30.902
Where'd it come from?

05:30.902 --> 05:32.152
- I don't know.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.550
It was probably nothing.

05:34.550 --> 05:35.690
Let's just go upstairs.

05:35.690 --> 05:36.523
- I don't think so.

05:36.523 --> 05:38.798
I'm leaving right now!

05:38.798 --> 05:41.548
(dramatic music)

05:43.939 --> 05:46.199
- Ah, screw it, I'm gone too.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.429
(screaming)

05:48.429 --> 05:49.262
Babe?

05:50.547 --> 05:53.681
(mysterious music)

05:53.681 --> 05:54.514
Babe?

05:56.654 --> 05:57.487
Crap!

05:57.487 --> 05:58.320
Come on.

05:59.374 --> 06:04.374
(dramatic music)
(grunting)

06:08.414 --> 06:10.747
(screaming)

06:13.808 --> 06:18.558
(eerie music)
(grunting)

06:41.144 --> 06:44.124
(door slams)

06:44.124 --> 06:46.624
(eerie music)

07:06.600 --> 07:08.850

07:10.469 --> 07:15.052

07:31.345 --> 07:34.428

09:13.814 --> 09:17.314
(drowned out radio music)

09:21.121 --> 09:22.876
(tires screeching)

09:22.876 --> 09:24.254
- Jeez, Brad!

09:24.254 --> 09:25.796
Take it easy on the pedal!

09:25.796 --> 09:28.290
Like, look what you made me do!

09:28.290 --> 09:29.859
- Classic.

09:29.859 --> 09:32.091
- Yeah, well, laugh it
up, you big dumb jock.

09:32.091 --> 09:32.930
- Whatever, man.

09:32.930 --> 09:34.900
Is everyone all right back there?

09:34.900 --> 09:37.080
Did everyone survive the curb?

09:37.080 --> 09:38.120
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.833
You big dumb, jock.

09:43.060 --> 09:43.893
- Ladies?

09:45.020 --> 09:46.040
- Me?

09:46.040 --> 09:46.960
I'm good.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.543
My makeup doesn't smear.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.233
- Bobbi?

09:54.300 --> 09:56.133
Hey Bobbi, Earth to Bobbi.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.070
- What?

09:58.070 --> 10:00.790
- I was asking if you were
all right, I guess so.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.363
- Oh no, I'm fine.

10:03.610 --> 10:06.240
Hey, I think we're only a
few miles from the farm now.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.227
- Good, 'cause I'm tired of driving,

10:07.227 --> 10:09.410
and we need to get some more gas too.

10:09.410 --> 10:13.554
- Oh, and we need more
beer, that's for sure.

10:13.554 --> 10:14.613
(laughing)

10:14.613 --> 10:16.520
♪ Daphne the booze hound ♪

10:16.520 --> 10:18.980
- Why don't you just stick
to your makeup, Barbie.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.210
- Well, it looks like everything we need

10:20.210 --> 10:21.310
to drive is over here.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.123
- Didn't you hear me?

10:26.123 --> 10:27.420
I said I'll only be a minute.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.920
- I'll come in too.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.590
- I'm only going in to
pick up a couple of things,

10:30.590 --> 10:31.630
and I'll be right out.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.100
No need to get out of the car.

10:33.100 --> 10:33.933
- Cliff.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.720
We go through the same routine every time.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.640
You wind up fiddling around
in there for like 20 minutes,

10:39.640 --> 10:41.940
and I wind up sitting in a hot car.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.090
Not today.

10:43.090 --> 10:45.797
- Every time we go in there,
you end up wandering off.

10:46.787 --> 10:47.793
- I do not!

10:48.680 --> 10:49.983
You're being silly,

10:53.612 --> 10:56.362
(birds chirping)

11:05.154 --> 11:07.150
(car doors slamming)

11:07.150 --> 11:09.090
Ha, serves you right!

11:09.090 --> 11:10.470
Why don't you fix that?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.980
- I did fix it.

11:11.980 --> 11:13.410
- Fine job you did.

11:13.410 --> 11:14.610
- Will you stop nagging?

11:15.920 --> 11:18.870
- What is all that stuff you
keep shoving in there anyways?

11:18.870 --> 11:22.990
Ropes, knives, camping gear, a moose gun.

11:22.990 --> 11:25.230
What are we survivalist in the Outback?

11:25.230 --> 11:27.360
- It's an army issue flare gun.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.110
Just goes to show what you know.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.391
(catchy rock music)

12:09.162 --> 12:12.245
(lighthearted music)

12:16.280 --> 12:17.113
- Dude.

12:17.113 --> 12:18.430
Did you see that woman in the parking lot?

12:18.430 --> 12:19.470
- Oh yeah.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.690
- Now that is what I call a MILF, ugh.

12:21.690 --> 12:22.523
- Bro.

12:22.523 --> 12:23.810
The very definition.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.930
- But how does a guy like him end up

12:25.930 --> 12:26.990
with a fine piece like her?

12:26.990 --> 12:27.823
I don't get it.

12:27.823 --> 12:28.656
- No surprise.

12:28.656 --> 12:29.489
You never get it.

12:29.489 --> 12:30.750
- Yeah, real funny, dude.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.970
- Bro, how do you think?

12:31.970 --> 12:34.793
It's the money, the green, the moola.

12:37.930 --> 12:39.143
- Oh yeah.

12:42.116 --> 12:45.199
(lighthearted music)

12:51.094 --> 12:52.370
- Hey there, pretty lady.

12:52.370 --> 12:54.560
What you thinkin' of buying?

12:54.560 --> 12:55.940
- I'm just looking.

12:55.940 --> 12:57.740
We're not gonna be here long.

12:57.740 --> 13:00.220
We just came to pick up gas and booze.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.794
- Booze, huh?

13:01.794 --> 13:03.060
Why not just buy some beer right now?

13:03.060 --> 13:04.812
We can hang out for a while.

13:04.812 --> 13:06.953
- You don't waste any time, do you?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.610
- The name's Josh.

13:08.610 --> 13:11.947
- Well, Josh, I'm here
with my boyfriend, so...

13:11.947 --> 13:14.670
- So, I don't see him around.

13:14.670 --> 13:15.940
So, what do you say?

13:15.940 --> 13:20.040
- He's like, just down
one of these aisles, so...

13:20.040 --> 13:21.610
Beat it.

13:21.610 --> 13:23.610
- Now that ain't a friendly way to talk.

13:24.730 --> 13:27.510
- I said beat it.

13:27.510 --> 13:29.090
- Hey, this guy bothering you?

13:29.090 --> 13:31.245
- Josh here was just leaving.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.105
- Good for him.

13:32.105 --> 13:34.340
- Me and the lady were just
having a conversation, sport-o.

13:34.340 --> 13:35.340
- Hey man, get lost.

13:36.900 --> 13:37.733
- Care to repeat that?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.283
- I said get lost, grease monkey.

13:47.122 --> 13:48.362
You're lucky.

13:48.362 --> 13:49.529
Come on, baby.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.583
- See ya, sport-o.

13:54.940 --> 13:58.560
- So you mean to tell me you
really own that old place?

13:58.560 --> 13:59.613
- Yeah, that's right.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.523
- That's some inheritance.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.460
- What do you mean?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.240
- Nothing, nothing.

14:07.240 --> 14:12.240
I mean, well, I just
can't picture a young girl

14:12.410 --> 14:15.820
like you living in that old farmhouse,

14:15.820 --> 14:19.773
all isolated out in the middle of nowhere.

14:21.640 --> 14:24.290
- Well, I haven't decided
if I'm going to move there.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.590
I'm just going out there a
few days to check it out.

14:27.590 --> 14:28.880
- Excuse me.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.210
Did I hear you say you're heading out

14:30.210 --> 14:32.660
to that old farmhouse
down the road a piece?

14:32.660 --> 14:34.230
- Yeah, that's right.

14:34.230 --> 14:36.540
- And you own that now?

14:36.540 --> 14:38.116
- Right again.

14:38.116 --> 14:40.837
- You wouldn't happen to have
any proof on that, would you?

14:41.890 --> 14:43.790
I know, it's an odd question, but...

14:57.699 --> 14:58.785
- Is something going on up here?

14:58.785 --> 14:59.618
Is there a problem?

14:59.618 --> 15:00.740
I mean, we have ID.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.850
- No, no problem.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.970
Just get concerned when
people get roaming around

15:04.970 --> 15:06.630
at that old place.

15:06.630 --> 15:10.313
Lots of broken glass and
rusty nails lying around.

15:10.313 --> 15:11.308
You know?

15:11.308 --> 15:13.410
- I hope we all have our shots.

15:13.410 --> 15:14.400
- Yeah, well.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.393
You guys take care, have a good day.

15:18.038 --> 15:19.350
- Well, that was weird.

15:19.350 --> 15:20.500
- I'll go pump the gas.

15:29.188 --> 15:31.855
(ominous music)

15:36.844 --> 15:39.011
(ringing)

15:57.290 --> 15:58.730
- You can't go out there.

15:58.730 --> 16:00.670
That's the death farm.

16:00.670 --> 16:01.580
- What?

16:01.580 --> 16:02.910
- I just said-

16:02.910 --> 16:05.963
- Don't bother those
kids with your nonsense.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.570
- I was just telling her-

16:08.570 --> 16:10.935
- Not another word.

16:10.935 --> 16:13.602
(ominous music)

16:23.875 --> 16:27.010
- That sheriff was acting
weird, don't you think?

16:27.010 --> 16:27.863
- What sheriff?

16:28.730 --> 16:31.840
- The local sheriff wanted
proof Bobbi owned the place.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.090
- What?

16:33.090 --> 16:34.113
That's weird.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.110
Hey guys, speaking of weird,

16:38.110 --> 16:39.910
there was this chick
at the store that said

16:39.910 --> 16:41.480
we shouldn't go to the farm.

16:41.480 --> 16:44.147
She called it the "death farm".

16:45.120 --> 16:47.992
Does anybody know what
she's talking about?

16:47.992 --> 16:50.522
- Hey Bobbi, you got no
idea what's going on?

16:50.522 --> 16:51.460
- Um, okay.

16:51.460 --> 16:52.293
Well...

16:53.760 --> 16:56.890
There was some people
murdered there 30 years ago.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.730
It was the woman that owned the place

16:58.730 --> 17:00.670
and a couple of her nephews.

17:00.670 --> 17:03.380
- And what, you like didn't
think to mention this

17:03.380 --> 17:04.780
before we left?

17:04.780 --> 17:05.720
- I'm sorry.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.320
I didn't want to freak you guys out,

17:07.320 --> 17:09.480
and it was so long ago.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.620
- Wait.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.283
The woman who owned the place?

17:13.370 --> 17:16.110
So like, you're related to her?

17:16.110 --> 17:18.030
- Yeah, but not closely.

17:18.030 --> 17:20.223
I mean, I never even met her.

17:20.223 --> 17:21.123
- Well, I like it.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.460
The Death Farm.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.795
Now that's retro.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.620
(laughing)

17:26.620 --> 17:29.520
- Yeah, I definitely want to drink there.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.285
- You want to drink anywhere.

17:31.285 --> 17:33.535
(laughing)

17:36.162 --> 17:39.162
(melancholic music)

18:18.417 --> 18:21.167
(birds chirping)

18:24.845 --> 18:29.845
(heavy breathing)
(wondrous music)

18:42.860 --> 18:44.170
- Wow.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.513
It certainly looks old.

18:48.310 --> 18:51.110
- Hey, what's up with this?

18:51.110 --> 18:52.283
- Let me guess, no signal.

18:52.283 --> 18:55.580
- Yeah, like, how did you know?

18:55.580 --> 18:56.413
- Babe, we're in the middle of nowhere,

18:56.413 --> 18:57.643
of course there's no signal.

18:58.867 --> 19:00.720
- Well, that sucks.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.053
- Don't feel bad, I lost mine miles ago.

19:03.990 --> 19:05.183
- Yeah, same here.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.010
- Gopher, didn't you
just hear what I told...

19:11.500 --> 19:12.333
- Wait for it.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.323
Wait for it.

19:15.427 --> 19:17.090
Ha, full bars!

19:17.090 --> 19:21.240
In your face, and in your
face, and in your face,

19:21.240 --> 19:22.770
and in your face.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.152
- Let's go check out the house.

19:25.152 --> 19:27.520
- What a dick.

19:27.520 --> 19:32.520
(intense music)
(heavy breathing)

19:48.740 --> 19:51.073
(chuckling)

19:51.917 --> 19:52.780
- Yup.

19:52.780 --> 19:54.593
It's old on the inside too.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.840
- I don't know, I think it's homey.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.190
You know, in like, an
American Gothic kind of way.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.768
- Let's check upstairs.

20:03.768 --> 20:06.851
(lighthearted music)

20:16.030 --> 20:17.430
Hey, we got electricity

20:19.856 --> 20:22.570
(sink running)

20:22.570 --> 20:24.503
And running water.

20:24.503 --> 20:26.330
- Oh, bummer.

20:26.330 --> 20:28.993
I was like, so looking
forward to roughing it.

20:30.710 --> 20:31.753
That was a joke.

20:33.504 --> 20:36.587
(lighthearted music)

20:38.660 --> 20:42.860
- Okay, so since this is
like the best room so far,

20:42.860 --> 20:44.610
me and Brad call dibs.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.443
- Sure.

20:45.443 --> 20:47.873
You are my guests after all.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.411
- Let me try, maybe it's just stuck.

20:58.411 --> 21:01.494
(lighthearted music)

21:03.955 --> 21:05.120
It's like there's a
brick wall or something

21:05.120 --> 21:05.970
behind this door.

21:06.870 --> 21:08.580
Looks like no one's
sleeping in here tonight.

21:08.580 --> 21:10.600
- All right, well, let's
just head back downstairs,

21:10.600 --> 21:11.900
we'll figure it out later.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.043
(lighthearted music)

21:20.750 --> 21:23.760
Well, since this is the only other

21:23.760 --> 21:25.000
accessible bedroom tonight,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.158
I guess this is just gonna
be us girls bunking in here.

21:28.158 --> 21:29.580
What do you say, Daph?

21:29.580 --> 21:31.180
- Works for me.

21:31.180 --> 21:34.263
(lighthearted music)

21:35.690 --> 21:36.780
Hey, Retro Boy.

21:36.780 --> 21:38.332
How's that couch treating you?

21:38.332 --> 21:39.165
- It's all right.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.033
Hey, where's my bedroom?

21:42.949 --> 21:44.999
You know, it sucks to be the odd man out.

21:49.971 --> 21:52.888
(mysterious music)

23:16.720 --> 23:19.470
(birds chirping)

23:28.549 --> 23:31.216
(erratic music)

24:09.973 --> 24:12.973
(catchy rock music)

24:36.733 --> 24:37.983
- What a bitch.

24:45.643 --> 24:47.320
- I went into the barn to look around,

24:47.320 --> 24:48.490
but it was gettin' too dark,

24:48.490 --> 24:50.740
so I definitely want to
get in there tomorrow

24:50.740 --> 24:51.823
to see what's there.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.410
- Bobbi.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.010
There's plenty of time for that.

24:56.950 --> 25:00.470
What you need is to
unwind after a long day.

25:00.470 --> 25:01.963
Here, have a drink.

25:03.150 --> 25:05.100
- Okay, maybe just one.

25:05.100 --> 25:05.933
- There you go.

25:09.137 --> 25:12.137
(catchy rock music)

25:14.360 --> 25:18.430
So, tell me, do you really know more about

25:18.430 --> 25:20.193
that murder story in this place?

25:21.440 --> 25:24.140
- I researched it a little
bit before we came here,

25:24.140 --> 25:26.940
and apparently they suspected

25:26.940 --> 25:29.570
another relative that did yard work.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.630
One newspaper said that he got questioned,

25:32.630 --> 25:34.920
and another said that he disappeared.

25:34.920 --> 25:35.870
- Well, who was he?

25:36.890 --> 25:39.040
- Some young guy named Jeremy.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.380
I think he had mental problems.

25:41.380 --> 25:43.400
- So, he could have done it?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.630
- I don't know.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.880
I could not find anything
else more about it.

25:49.130 --> 25:53.430
- So he could still be
lurking in the shadows

25:53.430 --> 25:55.685
after all these years?

25:55.685 --> 25:56.690
(laughing)

25:56.690 --> 25:59.343
- Yeah, I think you've
had too much to drink.

26:01.010 --> 26:03.132
- [Daphne] Yeah, probably.

26:03.132 --> 26:06.132
(catchy rock music)

26:11.521 --> 26:13.688
(moaning)

26:14.982 --> 26:16.841
- [Liz] Oh, yeah.

26:16.841 --> 26:18.611
(moaning)

26:18.611 --> 26:19.694
Mm, mm, yeah.

26:21.769 --> 26:23.447
(moaning)

26:23.447 --> 26:26.403
Oh, Brad!
(moaning)

26:26.403 --> 26:29.003
- I'm the big, dumb jock
with an airhead girlfriend.

26:30.730 --> 26:32.020
Life is so not fair.

26:33.284 --> 26:35.451
(moaning)

26:38.507 --> 26:41.507
(crickets chirping)

26:50.362 --> 26:55.362
(door creaks)
(dramatic music)

27:06.906 --> 27:09.323
(door shuts)

27:10.763 --> 27:13.680
(mysterious music)

28:09.311 --> 28:12.394
(ominous screeching)

28:30.905 --> 28:32.780
- Welcome to the farm.

28:32.780 --> 28:33.703
We can be friends.

28:36.119 --> 28:38.952
(heavy breathing)

28:56.213 --> 28:59.380
(birds chirping)

28:59.380 --> 29:02.047
(alarm ringing)

29:06.268 --> 29:08.518
(groaning)

29:14.550 --> 29:16.350
- Oh, man.

29:16.350 --> 29:17.483
It's already noon.

29:20.710 --> 29:22.303
Almost half the day is over.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.423
- I made some coffee and
toast if you want any.

29:29.470 --> 29:31.067
- Thanks.

29:31.067 --> 29:32.767
I could definitely use the coffee.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.410
- You know, you might want
to cut back on the drinking.

29:41.410 --> 29:42.243
Just a little.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.810
- Listen, if I wanted my mother here,

29:47.810 --> 29:49.790
I would have invited her.

29:49.790 --> 29:52.723
I came to get away from
all that for a couple days.

29:54.490 --> 29:55.580
- I'm sorry, you're right.

29:55.580 --> 29:58.943
I gotta stop telling people
what I think is best for them.

30:00.370 --> 30:01.913
- No, you're right.

30:03.140 --> 30:05.283
You've always been the responsible one.

30:08.170 --> 30:10.130
Where's everybody else?

30:10.130 --> 30:11.633
- Out lounging in the sun.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.140
- Well, I wouldn't count
on much help from them

30:15.140 --> 30:16.830
in surveying the place.

30:16.830 --> 30:19.410
- Yeah, I want to look around today.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.830
I want to go through the fields

30:20.830 --> 30:23.173
and see where the property line ends.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.709
- You feel like having some company?

30:26.709 --> 30:27.542
- Sure.

30:28.384 --> 30:31.801
(drowned out rock music)

30:54.811 --> 30:57.728
(mysterious music)

31:27.682 --> 31:28.860
- Wow.

31:28.860 --> 31:30.403
These fields go on forever.

31:31.632 --> 31:34.720
We've been walking for
like 20 minutes already.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.553
- I know.

31:35.553 --> 31:37.963
And we're not even close
to the property line yet.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.120
- Really?

31:40.120 --> 31:41.700
I think you may have
some money on your hands

31:41.700 --> 31:43.400
with this place.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.858
- Maybe.

31:44.858 --> 31:47.775
(mysterious music)

31:57.250 --> 32:01.863
- Looks like somebody set up
camp here quite a awhile ago.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.210
- Why would anybody just
leave their stuff here?

32:07.853 --> 32:08.770
- Beats me.

32:09.931 --> 32:12.848
(mysterious music)

32:50.359 --> 32:51.706
More campers?

32:51.706 --> 32:54.623
(mysterious music)

33:18.920 --> 33:20.033
- Well, this is it,

33:20.033 --> 33:22.233
this is the end of the property line here.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.026
- Yeah, but what's that?

33:29.026 --> 33:31.693
(intense music)

33:36.110 --> 33:39.570
It could be a dead animal killed

33:39.570 --> 33:42.113
by the person wearing that hat?

33:43.360 --> 33:45.220
- You really think so?

33:45.220 --> 33:47.500
- I don't know, I'm just a city girl.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.300
- Well, we should probably
start heading back

33:49.300 --> 33:50.300
before it gets dark.

33:51.470 --> 33:52.303
- Yeah.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.033
It's a long walk.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.406
I need a drink.

33:56.406 --> 33:59.323
(mysterious music)

34:04.146 --> 34:05.628
- I'm gonna go cut some wood.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.526
- All right, but hurry back, okay?

34:07.526 --> 34:08.926
- All right.

34:08.926 --> 34:11.593
(intense music)

34:32.800 --> 34:35.050
(groaning)

34:47.480 --> 34:49.950
- Damn thing, God damn it.

34:49.950 --> 34:51.240
Go in.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.907
(intense music)

35:07.216 --> 35:12.216
(machete slices)
(groaning)

35:22.267 --> 35:25.684
(drowned out rock music)

35:38.330 --> 35:39.540
- Hey.

35:39.540 --> 35:40.720
- Hey there.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.890
- Didn't I see you in the parking lot

35:41.890 --> 35:43.550
of that store yesterday?

35:43.550 --> 35:45.680
- Well now, isn't that a silly question?

35:45.680 --> 35:47.410
You know you did.

35:47.410 --> 35:48.580
- I'm Gopher.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.620
- Gopher?

35:49.620 --> 35:51.610
Well, isn't that the cutest name?

35:51.610 --> 35:53.370
Like the furry little animal.

35:53.370 --> 35:55.560
- So, what can I do for you?

35:55.560 --> 35:56.500
- Gina.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.950
I just came by to welcome
you guys to the neighborhood.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.113
So to speak.

36:02.270 --> 36:03.550
- Cool.

36:03.550 --> 36:04.860
- Are your friends here?

36:04.860 --> 36:05.770
- Friends?

36:05.770 --> 36:07.940
Uh, oh yeah, I have those.

36:07.940 --> 36:08.870
Friends.

36:08.870 --> 36:11.190
Yeah, they're inside, probably.

36:11.190 --> 36:12.363
I can introduce you.

36:15.710 --> 36:16.620
Hey guys, this is Gina.

36:16.620 --> 36:18.780
She came to welcome us
to the neighborhood.

36:18.780 --> 36:20.940
- Oh, hey, I'm Brad, this is Liz.

36:20.940 --> 36:21.870
- Oh right, I saw you guys

36:21.870 --> 36:23.920
going into the store yesterday, remember?

36:25.030 --> 36:26.320
- No, I don't think so.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.890
Sorry.

36:27.890 --> 36:29.170
- It's okay.

36:29.170 --> 36:30.470
I definitely remember you.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.260
- So, do you live around here?

36:34.260 --> 36:35.693
- Down the road a ways.

36:36.560 --> 36:39.140
It's not often that we get
visitors in these parts.

36:39.140 --> 36:41.000
- Oh yeah, we're here
for our friend Bobbi.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.310
She owns the land now.

36:42.310 --> 36:43.790
Oh, isn't that something?

36:43.790 --> 36:45.440
She owns all of this?

36:45.440 --> 36:46.880
- Yeah, it's hard to believe, isn't it?

36:46.880 --> 36:49.160
- If you want, I can show
you around the place.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.370
I mean, it's a super
nice night for a walk.

36:52.370 --> 36:54.540
- No, I should probably get going.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.290
But thanks.

36:56.290 --> 36:58.083
Another time perhaps?

36:58.083 --> 37:01.540
(clock ticking)

37:01.540 --> 37:05.330
- I'm sure your husband
is missing you already.

37:05.330 --> 37:07.240
- I doubt that.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.103
But sure was nice meeting you kids.

37:11.050 --> 37:12.790
- Oh, well, now where are my manners?

37:12.790 --> 37:14.600
We haven't even offered you anything.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.660
How about a cup of coffee before you go?

37:16.660 --> 37:17.860
- No, I'm fine.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.980
Thanks.

37:18.980 --> 37:22.050
- After all that night
driving and the ride home?

37:22.050 --> 37:24.180
At least have a cup before you go.

37:24.180 --> 37:25.350
- It's okay.

37:25.350 --> 37:27.160
I'm fine.
- Yeah, she's right.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.190
Have something before you go.

37:29.190 --> 37:31.530
- Oh, well, maybe just one cup.

37:31.530 --> 37:33.160
Thanks.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.070
So Brad, do you play football?

37:35.070 --> 37:37.913
You look like a young
man who'd play football.

37:38.790 --> 37:39.623
- Um, yeah.

37:39.623 --> 37:40.950
Actually I play college ball.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.520
Hoping to go pro next year.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.930
- Wow, isn't that exciting?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.359
I find football to be...

37:46.359 --> 37:48.370
(gasps)

37:48.370 --> 37:50.170
- Oh my goodness.

37:50.170 --> 37:51.790
I'm like so sorry.

37:51.790 --> 37:54.053
How could I have been so clumsy?

37:55.350 --> 37:57.750
Here, let me get you
something to clean that up.

38:00.090 --> 38:01.530
Here, let me help you.

38:01.530 --> 38:03.763
- No, I'll do it.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.950
- I'm sure that'll come off in the wash

38:06.950 --> 38:08.893
as soon as you get home.

38:10.290 --> 38:11.318
- Where's your bathroom?

38:11.318 --> 38:12.151
- Here, I'll show you.

38:12.151 --> 38:12.984
It's actually right upstair-

38:12.984 --> 38:15.020
- I'm sure she can find it herself, Brad,

38:18.908 --> 38:21.241
- I'm gonna go back outside.

38:24.420 --> 38:25.253
(door slams)

38:25.253 --> 38:26.601
- You know what?

38:26.601 --> 38:28.210
I think I'm going outside too.

38:28.210 --> 38:29.630
For a walk.

38:29.630 --> 38:30.513
Alone.

38:33.690 --> 38:35.720
- Chicks are a real pain in the ass.

38:39.462 --> 38:42.879
(drowned out rock music)

38:54.421 --> 38:57.533
(clock ticking)

38:57.533 --> 38:58.783
- Ah, screw it.

39:02.729 --> 39:05.729
(crickets chirping)

39:11.796 --> 39:14.796
(suspenseful music)

39:49.852 --> 39:52.685
(brain squishing)

40:04.898 --> 40:07.231
(chuckling)

40:35.812 --> 40:37.633
- Just great.

40:37.633 --> 40:38.550
That bitch!

40:42.100 --> 40:44.767
(ominous music)

41:17.426 --> 41:20.093
(clock ticking)

41:28.035 --> 41:28.868
Hm.

41:28.868 --> 41:29.993
Mine now, bitch.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.513
Try to say something about it.

41:34.140 --> 41:36.807
(ominous music)

41:47.906 --> 41:50.823
(leaves crunching)

41:57.207 --> 41:58.218
- Brad?

41:58.218 --> 41:59.597
Is that you?

41:59.597 --> 42:02.514
(mysterious music)

42:10.613 --> 42:11.446
Brad?

42:11.446 --> 42:13.950
If that's you goofing
off, you can stop it.

42:13.950 --> 42:15.875
I'm pissed off enough already.

42:15.875 --> 42:18.792
(mysterious music)

42:30.785 --> 42:33.702
(thunder rumbling)

42:54.046 --> 42:56.963
(thunder rumbling)

43:08.265 --> 43:11.360
- I can't believe we're not back yet.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.510
You have a massive
amount of property here.

43:15.180 --> 43:16.825
- I know.

43:16.825 --> 43:19.200
Well, we're almost back.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.900
I'm glad too, 'cause I'm getting tired.

43:21.900 --> 43:22.733
Come on.

43:24.385 --> 43:26.885
(tense music)

43:41.032 --> 43:41.865
- Crap!

43:41.865 --> 43:42.698
Josh?

43:42.698 --> 43:44.280
What are you doing all the way out here?

43:45.541 --> 43:46.374
(laughing)

43:46.374 --> 43:47.583
- I just came to see you.

43:49.180 --> 43:50.650
- Really?

43:50.650 --> 43:51.723
You came out here?

43:52.820 --> 43:54.120
You don't give up, do you?

43:55.117 --> 43:57.360
- It's just the way I roll, babe.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.980
- Pretty cocky for a grease monkey.

43:59.980 --> 44:00.813
- Bitch!

44:03.310 --> 44:05.433
- Hey, let's go in the barn.

44:07.551 --> 44:10.341
(thunder rumbling)

44:10.341 --> 44:13.258
(mysterious music)

44:26.309 --> 44:28.260
- Yeah, up yours, jock-o!

44:28.260 --> 44:29.852
- Shut the hell up.

44:29.852 --> 44:32.075
- We go good together.

44:32.075 --> 44:34.817
(dramatic music)

44:34.817 --> 44:36.890
(rumbling)

44:36.890 --> 44:38.620
- What was that?

44:38.620 --> 44:40.220
- What was what?

44:40.220 --> 44:43.043
- I heard a sound, like wood cracking.

44:45.440 --> 44:46.290
- It was nothing.

44:50.789 --> 44:52.445
(door creaks)

44:52.445 --> 44:53.930
(laughing)

44:53.930 --> 44:55.730
I get it.

44:55.730 --> 44:57.660
The jock-o's sneaking around the barn,

44:57.660 --> 44:59.340
afraid to face me.

44:59.340 --> 45:00.173
Come on out!

45:01.300 --> 45:02.133
- Brad?

45:03.772 --> 45:06.112
- That's what I thought, you wimp.

45:06.112 --> 45:06.945
All talk.

45:08.015 --> 45:10.815
Well, keep hiding, and watch
as your girlfriend does me.

45:11.740 --> 45:13.284
Check this out.

45:13.284 --> 45:15.924
(yelling)

45:15.924 --> 45:17.091
- You asshole!

45:17.930 --> 45:20.530
If you think I'm gonna blow you,

45:20.530 --> 45:24.135
like this quick, you're crazy.

45:24.135 --> 45:25.524
(laughing)

45:25.524 --> 45:28.680
(ominous music)

45:28.680 --> 45:29.930
Brad, are you really...

45:31.308 --> 45:34.360
(scythe slices)

45:34.360 --> 45:37.027
(ominous music)

45:41.061 --> 45:43.811
(shower running)

45:54.202 --> 45:57.119
(thunder rumbling)

46:12.297 --> 46:14.439
(laughing)

46:14.439 --> 46:17.106
(ominous music)

46:42.674 --> 46:46.091
(drowned out rock music)

47:04.567 --> 47:08.008
(shower running)

47:08.008 --> 47:10.263
(grunting)

47:10.263 --> 47:11.502
(ominous music)

47:11.502 --> 47:12.335
- Hello?

47:16.490 --> 47:17.590
Is somebody out there?

47:20.570 --> 47:21.920
Aw, come on.

47:21.920 --> 47:23.690
One of you boys out there

47:23.690 --> 47:25.090
trying to get a little peep?

47:26.398 --> 47:29.065
(ominous music)

47:39.088 --> 47:40.843
(door shuts)

47:40.843 --> 47:44.480
Come on and show yourself, don't be shy.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.250
I may even give you a little quick peek.

47:48.611 --> 47:51.611
(suspenseful music)

47:57.780 --> 47:59.337
Brad, is that you?

48:01.417 --> 48:05.055
Snuck away from your
bitch girlfriend, did you?

48:05.055 --> 48:08.055
(suspenseful music)

48:10.143 --> 48:12.516
(gasping)

48:12.516 --> 48:14.683
(yelping)

48:19.953 --> 48:23.370
(drowned out rock music)

48:27.550 --> 48:29.353
- Aw crap, dead batteries.

48:39.124 --> 48:40.190
All right.

48:40.190 --> 48:42.183
Where are those batteries?

48:44.274 --> 48:45.924
I know they're in here somewhere.

48:48.840 --> 48:50.923
Well, boombox it is.

48:53.109 --> 48:55.526
(door slams)

49:08.792 --> 49:11.240
(boombox static)

49:11.240 --> 49:13.270
(thunder rumbling)

49:13.270 --> 49:15.283
Oh, an awesome storm's coming.

49:18.610 --> 49:19.443
Almost.

49:19.443 --> 49:20.670
Wait for it.

49:20.670 --> 49:21.763
Wait for it.

49:23.440 --> 49:24.779
Got it.

49:24.779 --> 49:26.080
(drowned out rock music)

49:26.080 --> 49:27.976
Kicking it old school.

49:27.976 --> 49:29.104
(drowned out rock music)

49:29.104 --> 49:32.574
(rumbling)
(door creaks)

49:32.574 --> 49:34.924
(thunder rumbling)
Hey, is somebody out there?

49:37.959 --> 49:41.376
(drowned out rock music)

49:44.661 --> 49:47.578
(thunder rumbling)

49:53.334 --> 49:56.123
- Do you know whose
car that was out there?

49:56.123 --> 49:57.723
No, but I'm sure we'll find out.

49:58.926 --> 50:00.773
- Hey guys, we're back.!

50:00.773 --> 50:03.650
(clock ticking)

50:03.650 --> 50:04.933
Is anybody there?

50:07.060 --> 50:08.980
- Maybe they're out back?

50:08.980 --> 50:10.133
- Yeah, probably.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.820
I'm gonna go change.

50:12.820 --> 50:13.653
- All right.

50:13.653 --> 50:15.970
I'm gonna go grab some beers
and then head out back.

50:15.970 --> 50:17.030
- Okay. (chuckling)

50:17.030 --> 50:17.900
I'll see you in a bit.

50:17.900 --> 50:18.733
- All right.

50:20.138 --> 50:23.138
(catchy rock music)

50:30.288 --> 50:33.259
(boombox static)

50:33.259 --> 50:34.092
Gopher?

50:36.382 --> 50:37.491
(thunder rumbling)

50:37.491 --> 50:38.709
Hey, Gopher.

50:38.709 --> 50:41.699
Where you at?

50:41.699 --> 50:43.449
I brought you a beer.

50:47.080 --> 50:48.850
Well, screw it then.

50:48.850 --> 50:49.683
More for me.

50:58.123 --> 51:01.040
(mysterious music)

51:02.340 --> 51:03.173
Who are you?

51:06.142 --> 51:07.571
Hey.

51:07.571 --> 51:08.404
Hey.

51:08.404 --> 51:09.890
Hey, don't, don't.

51:09.890 --> 51:10.929
(gun fires)

51:10.929 --> 51:15.679
(gasping)
(fire blazing)

51:19.932 --> 51:22.849
(mysterious music)

51:31.961 --> 51:35.478
- All right buddy, into the tank.

51:35.478 --> 51:37.352
- This is police brutality!

51:37.352 --> 51:38.752
- Yeah, yeah, buddy.

51:38.752 --> 51:40.024
You sleep it off.

51:40.024 --> 51:41.357
- Okay, Sheriff.

51:43.008 --> 51:44.408
I'll see you in the morning.

51:46.280 --> 51:48.947
(phone ringing)

51:50.300 --> 51:51.240
- Sheriff's office.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.440
Deputy Langley speaking.

52:01.830 --> 52:02.680
- Sheriff Jordan.

52:04.040 --> 52:04.963
Oh, hey, Cliff.

52:06.210 --> 52:07.043
What?

52:07.890 --> 52:09.500
Missing?

52:09.500 --> 52:10.950
Well, how long she been gone?

52:12.720 --> 52:14.980
Look, Cliff, you know I can't file

52:14.980 --> 52:17.360
a missing person's report yet.

52:17.360 --> 52:19.163
Four hours is hardly very long.

52:21.420 --> 52:25.920
Yeah, look I know, but it's only been...

52:26.840 --> 52:29.040
Okay, okay, all right.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.349
I'm gonna be leaving here shortly.

52:31.349 --> 52:33.680
I'll take a swing out there.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.513
Yeah.

52:35.540 --> 52:36.830
Yeah, all right.

52:36.830 --> 52:37.853
I'll let you know.

52:38.930 --> 52:40.520
Okay.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.250
Yeah, you're welcome.

52:42.250 --> 52:43.083
Bye, Cliff.

52:46.610 --> 52:47.770
- What did Cliff want?

52:47.770 --> 52:48.730
Who's missing?

52:48.730 --> 52:49.870
- Gina.

52:49.870 --> 52:52.120
- Yeah, but she's only
been gone four hours.

52:52.120 --> 52:54.230
- Yeah, but he's worried about her.

52:54.230 --> 52:58.060
- About his wife or that car
with all that shit in it?

52:58.060 --> 53:00.370
- Probably equal parts on both.

53:00.370 --> 53:02.580
She took a ride out to the old farmhouse

53:02.580 --> 53:04.630
at the end of the Johnson Road.

53:04.630 --> 53:06.520
- Why the hell would she
go way out there for?

53:06.520 --> 53:08.490
- A bunch of young people
moved in out there.

53:08.490 --> 53:10.550
Two guys and three girls.

53:10.550 --> 53:12.491
- Yeah, young guys.

53:12.491 --> 53:13.324
(laughing)

53:13.324 --> 53:15.559
That's why Gina hasn't been back yet.

53:15.559 --> 53:17.267
- Yeah, yeah, well...

53:17.267 --> 53:18.920
All I know is it means a long ride

53:18.920 --> 53:20.483
for what I'm sure was nothing.

53:22.250 --> 53:23.280
Although...

53:23.280 --> 53:25.500
- [Langley] Something wrong, Sheriff?

53:25.500 --> 53:26.333
- Eh, no.

53:27.762 --> 53:30.103
It's just that place has
a bad history is all.

53:32.150 --> 53:33.200
And that stuff...

53:34.290 --> 53:36.310
That can wait 'til tomorrow.

53:36.310 --> 53:37.313
- Sheriff Jordan.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.530
- Yeah?

53:40.530 --> 53:43.433
- Why do they call the
place Splatter Farm?

53:46.165 --> 53:47.840
- Well, when I was a kid,

53:47.840 --> 53:50.363
my dad was the county
coroner in these parts.

53:51.440 --> 53:54.400
I went on the call with
him out to the farmhouse,

53:54.400 --> 53:55.300
30 some years ago.

53:56.690 --> 53:57.810
He made me stay in the car,

53:57.810 --> 54:01.593
but being the kid I had
to get out, look around.

54:03.581 --> 54:05.017
I wish I had listened to him.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.630
That place was a slaughter house.

54:08.930 --> 54:11.310
- Sorry, I thought they
were all rumors, you know?

54:11.310 --> 54:12.493
Local folklore.

54:13.860 --> 54:15.113
- No, all true.

54:16.230 --> 54:17.730
Worse than true, to be honest.

54:19.140 --> 54:21.130
Nobody knows for certain
what happened out there,

54:21.130 --> 54:24.113
but over the years,
I've pieced it together.

54:25.022 --> 54:27.500
Well, as far as I can reckon.

54:27.500 --> 54:29.020
- And?

54:29.020 --> 54:31.620
- A set of twins were
visiting their Aunt Lacy

54:31.620 --> 54:33.250
for the summer.

54:33.250 --> 54:35.320
She was an odd old bird.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.151
She had a handyman, Jeremy.

54:38.151 --> 54:40.237
A relative. I don't know,

54:40.237 --> 54:43.350
but I believe he was the
one that did the killing.

54:43.350 --> 54:46.000
- Some idea of yours, spending the summer

54:46.000 --> 54:48.110
with old bag Lacy.

54:48.110 --> 54:50.010
- That's Aunt Lacy.

54:50.010 --> 54:51.910
She's just lonely and needs the company.

54:51.910 --> 54:53.450
- I think she's strange.

54:53.450 --> 54:56.580
And that Jeremy, I don't trust him either.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.253
- Oh, it's all in your head.

54:59.900 --> 55:03.113
- I went outside, found
this on the farm boundary.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.953
- [Kid] There's a modified head in here!

55:06.953 --> 55:09.420
- Then tonight, when everyone's asleep,

55:09.420 --> 55:11.860
we go outside and do
our own checking around.

55:11.860 --> 55:14.370
- It's about time we get
to the bottom of this.

55:14.370 --> 55:15.759
- Exactly.

55:15.759 --> 55:18.426
(ominous music)

55:21.920 --> 55:23.803
- [Lacy] You'll do anything I ask.

55:25.044 --> 55:25.877
Anything.

55:30.162 --> 55:31.460
- Jeremy!

55:31.460 --> 55:33.240
Get out here, you bastard.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.223
You know I'm not afraid of you.

55:35.223 --> 55:37.284
(groaning)

55:37.284 --> 55:39.951
(ominous music)

55:42.953 --> 55:45.786
(heavy breathing)

56:31.109 --> 56:33.776
(claws slicing)

56:45.310 --> 56:46.230
- Jeremy?

56:46.230 --> 56:48.691
What have you found to my brother?

56:48.691 --> 56:50.290
(gun fires)

56:50.290 --> 56:53.690
- They found pieces of what
we believe were the twins,

56:53.690 --> 56:56.163
Aunt Lacy, all over the lawn.

56:57.340 --> 56:59.103
And Jeremy was nowhere to be found.

57:01.280 --> 57:04.723
Under the house and in the
barn, dozens of bodies.

57:05.900 --> 57:07.063
Victims of the killer.

57:08.130 --> 57:10.276
- Now I know how it earned its name.

57:10.276 --> 57:12.609
(chuckling)

57:14.642 --> 57:17.309
(ominous music)

57:19.021 --> 57:21.938
(thunder rumbling)

57:27.769 --> 57:31.019
(electricity sparking)

57:40.448 --> 57:43.115
(ominous music)

58:06.814 --> 58:09.564
(water dripping)

58:12.530 --> 58:14.863
- Hey guys, is anyone up there?

58:18.770 --> 58:20.403
Did someone leave the faucet on?

58:21.961 --> 58:26.961
(water dripping)
(mysterious music)

58:32.991 --> 58:37.991
(tense music)
(water dripping)

58:46.670 --> 58:48.800
Hey, is anyone in there?

58:48.800 --> 58:51.300
(tense music)

58:58.110 --> 58:59.310
Is everything all right?

59:00.478 --> 59:02.978
(tense music)

59:14.856 --> 59:17.606
(dramatic music)

1:00:08.019 --> 1:00:09.070
(engine stuttering)

1:00:09.070 --> 1:00:10.653
No, no, no, no, no.

1:00:10.653 --> 1:00:13.653
(engine stuttering)

1:00:17.004 --> 1:00:19.754
(dramatic music)

1:00:21.327 --> 1:00:22.985
(engine stuttering)

1:00:22.985 --> 1:00:23.818
Come on!

1:00:25.090 --> 1:00:27.757
(ominous music)

1:00:49.626 --> 1:00:52.293
(door rumbling)

1:00:55.134 --> 1:00:58.134
(suspenseful music)

1:00:59.129 --> 1:01:01.379
(groaning)

1:01:18.229 --> 1:01:20.979
(dramatic music)

1:01:56.314 --> 1:01:57.147
Jeremy?

1:02:01.109 --> 1:02:02.879
- We can be friends.

1:02:02.879 --> 1:02:05.629
(dramatic music)

1:02:10.239 --> 1:02:11.458
- No.

1:02:11.458 --> 1:02:12.958
Stay away from me!

1:02:15.677 --> 1:02:19.239
(dramatic music)

1:02:19.239 --> 1:02:24.239
- Maybe later.

1:02:34.796 --> 1:02:36.963
(beeping)

1:02:54.184 --> 1:02:56.690
(door squeaks)

1:02:56.690 --> 1:02:59.607
(mysterious music)

1:03:25.959 --> 1:03:28.459
(tense music)

1:04:10.242 --> 1:04:11.349
- No, no!

1:04:11.349 --> 1:04:14.099
(dramatic music)

1:04:23.149 --> 1:04:26.591
Get away from me!

1:04:26.591 --> 1:04:29.341
(dramatic music)

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:33.133
Get away!

1:04:38.219 --> 1:04:40.552
(screaming)

1:04:45.824 --> 1:04:48.574
(dramatic music)

1:04:58.093 --> 1:05:00.593
(tense music)

1:05:04.715 --> 1:05:05.548
- Hello?

1:05:07.617 --> 1:05:08.978
Hello?

1:05:08.978 --> 1:05:11.367
It's Sheriff Jordan.

1:05:11.367 --> 1:05:12.895
Anybody in here?

1:05:12.895 --> 1:05:15.395
(tense music)

1:05:30.510 --> 1:05:31.343
Hello?

1:05:33.302 --> 1:05:34.635
Anybody up here?

1:05:36.791 --> 1:05:39.708
(mysterious music)

1:05:50.380 --> 1:05:53.130
(water dripping)

1:05:58.647 --> 1:05:59.480
My God.

1:06:00.340 --> 1:06:03.257
(mysterious music)

1:06:10.898 --> 1:06:13.398
(engine revs)

1:06:31.894 --> 1:06:32.727
- Help!

1:06:34.787 --> 1:06:35.715
- Stop!

1:06:35.715 --> 1:06:40.270
Hey, stop!

1:06:40.270 --> 1:06:43.103
(explosion booms)

1:06:52.574 --> 1:06:55.241
- Help!

1:06:55.241 --> 1:06:57.329
(fire blazing)

1:06:57.329 --> 1:06:58.162
- Damn!

1:07:03.197 --> 1:07:04.030
- Help!

1:07:05.697 --> 1:07:08.614
(mysterious music)

1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:15.513
- Sheriff Jordan to station.

1:07:17.021 --> 1:07:19.150
(radio chatter)

1:07:19.150 --> 1:07:21.970
Langley, I need some backup
out at the old farmhouse.

1:07:21.970 --> 1:07:23.178
Copy?

1:07:23.178 --> 1:07:25.845
(radio chatter)

1:07:26.890 --> 1:07:28.644
Langley, you there?

1:07:28.644 --> 1:07:30.280
(radio chatter)

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:32.864
Langley. I said I need
backup out the old farmhouse.

1:07:32.864 --> 1:07:34.022
Copy?

1:07:34.022 --> 1:07:36.772
(dramatic music)

1:07:45.646 --> 1:07:47.896

1:08:08.470 --> 1:08:09.303
