06:02.549 --> 06:05.074
My mind is clearer now

06:06.820 --> 06:10.347
At last, all too well

06:10.424 --> 06:12.551
I can see

06:12.626 --> 06:16.426
Where we all
soon will be

06:19.633 --> 06:22.397
If you strip away

06:22.469 --> 06:25.996
The myth from the man

06:26.073 --> 06:28.007
You will see

06:28.075 --> 06:32.413
Where we all
soon will be

06:33.981 --> 06:37.747
Jesus

06:37.818 --> 06:41.584
You've started to believe
the things they say of you

06:41.655 --> 06:47.525
You really do believe
this talk of God is true

06:49.296 --> 06:53.164
And all the good you've done
will soon get swept away

06:53.233 --> 06:55.201
You've begun
to matter more

06:55.269 --> 06:59.706
Than the things you say

07:05.579 --> 07:09.606
Listen, Jesus
I don't like what I see

07:09.683 --> 07:13.278
All I ask is that
you listen to me

07:13.354 --> 07:15.288
And remember

07:15.356 --> 07:18.291
I've been your right-hand man
all along

07:20.060 --> 07:23.552
You have set them all
on fire

07:23.630 --> 07:27.396
They think they've found
the new messiah

07:27.468 --> 07:30.904
And they'll hurt you
when they find they're wrong

07:34.241 --> 07:37.733
I remember when
this whole thing began

07:37.811 --> 07:41.611
No talk of God then
We called you a man

07:41.682 --> 07:43.616
And believe me

07:43.684 --> 07:47.085
My admiration for you
hasn't died

07:47.154 --> 07:51.056
But every word
you say today

07:51.125 --> 07:54.458
Gets twisted 'round
some other way

07:55.963 --> 08:00.297
And they'll hurt you
if they think you've lied

08:02.069 --> 08:05.232
Nazareth, your famous son
should have stayed a great unknown

08:05.305 --> 08:08.604
Like his father carving wood
he'd have made good

08:08.675 --> 08:11.872
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
would have suited Jesus best

08:11.945 --> 08:15.574
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

08:15.649 --> 08:19.380
Listen, Jesus
Do you care for your race

08:19.453 --> 08:23.048
Don't you see
we must keep in our place

08:23.123 --> 08:25.057
We are occupied

08:25.125 --> 08:29.960
Have you forgotten
how put down we are

08:30.030 --> 08:33.124
I am frightened
by the crowd

08:33.200 --> 08:37.135
For we are getting
much too loud

08:37.203 --> 08:40.662
And they'll crush us
if we go too far

If we go

08:42.743 --> 08:47.271
Too far

to see our chances

That's all you need do
Then I'll know it's all true

01:17:06.133 --> 01:17:10.160
Come on
King of the Jews

01:17:10.237 --> 01:17:15.265
Jesus, you just won't believe the hit
you've made around here

01:17:15.342 --> 01:17:20.041
You are all we talk about
You're the wonder of the year

01:17:20.113 --> 01:17:24.482
Oh, what a pity
if it's all a lie

01:17:24.551 --> 01:17:30.012
Still I'm sure that you can rock
the cynics if you try

01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:35.357
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ

01:17:35.428 --> 01:17:37.919
Prove to me that
you're no fool

01:17:37.998 --> 01:17:39.863
Walk across
my swimming pool

01:17:39.933 --> 01:17:41.867
- lf you do that for me
- Whoo !

01:17:41.935 --> 01:17:44.563
- Then I'll let you go free
- Whoo !

01:17:44.638 --> 01:17:48.039
Come on
King of the Jews

01:18:08.028 --> 01:18:12.397
I only ask what I'd ask
any superstar

01:18:12.465 --> 01:18:16.458
What is it that you have got
that puts you where you are

01:18:16.536 --> 01:18:19.061
Oh-ho-ho
I am waiting

01:18:19.139 --> 01:18:21.231
Yes, I'm a captive fan

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:21.603
I'm dying to be shown that
you are not just any man

01:18:21.603 --> 01:18:26.666
I'm dying to be shown that
you are not just any man

01:18:26.741 --> 01:18:32.270
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ

01:18:32.347 --> 01:18:34.838
Feed my household
with this bread

01:18:34.916 --> 01:18:37.544
You can do it
on your head

01:18:37.619 --> 01:18:41.453
Uh, or has something gone wrong ?
Jesus, why do you take so long ?

01:18:41.523 --> 01:18:45.220
Aw, come on,
King of the Jews !

01:18:46.327 --> 01:18:49.125
Hey, aren't you

01:18:49.197 --> 01:18:51.961
Scared of me, Christ

01:18:52.033 --> 01:18:55.525
Mister wonderful Christ

01:18:55.603 --> 01:18:57.764
Aaah !
You're a joke !

01:18:57.839 --> 01:19:01.570
You're not the Lord.
You're nothing but a fraud.

01:19:01.643 --> 01:19:06.239
Take him away
He's got nothing to say

01:19:06.314 --> 01:19:08.874

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:51.520
I've been living
to see you

01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:57.896
Dying to see you
but it shouldn't be like this

01:19:57.966 --> 01:20:04.201

Hurry up and tell me
This is just a dream

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:35.198
Or could we start again

Before it gets
too frightening

01:20:51.352 --> 01:20:53.946

a halt

My God
I saw him

01:23:23.037 --> 01:23:26.666
He looked three-quarters dead and
he was so bad I had to turn my head

01:23:26.741 --> 01:23:29.733
You beat him so hard
that he was bent and lame

01:23:29.811 --> 01:23:32.109
And I know who
everybody's gonna blame

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.648
I don't believe he knows
I acted for our good

01:23:34.715 --> 01:23:37.582
I'd save him all this suffering
if I could

01:23:37.652 --> 01:23:40.348
Don't believe
Our good

01:23:42.557 --> 01:23:45.549
And I'd save him
if I could

01:23:48.029 --> 01:23:51.829
Cut the confessions
Forget the excuses

01:23:51.899 --> 01:23:55.232
I don't understand why
you're filled with remorse

01:23:55.303 --> 01:23:58.636
All that you've said has
come true with a vengeance

01:23:58.706 --> 01:24:02.142
The mob turned against him
You backed the right horse

01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:05.475
What you have done will be
the saving of everyone

01:24:05.546 --> 01:24:09.004
You'll be remembered
forever for this

01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:12.519
And not only that
You've been paid for your efforts

01:24:12.587 --> 01:24:15.740
Pretty good wages
for one little kiss

01:24:15.873 --> 01:24:19.206
Christ, I know
you can't hear me

01:24:19.276 --> 01:24:22.734
But I only did
what you wanted me to

01:24:22.813 --> 01:24:26.180
Christ, I'd sell out
the nation

01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:29.708
For I have been saddled
with the murder of you

01:24:29.787 --> 01:24:33.120
I have been spattered
with innocent blood

01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:36.353
I shall be dragged through
the slime and the mud

01:24:36.427 --> 01:24:40.022
I have been spattered

01:24:40.097 --> 01:24:43.328

and the slime and the

I

01:25:02.953 --> 01:25:06.889
Don't know how
to love him

01:25:09.527 --> 01:25:13.725
I don't know
why he moves me

01:25:15.466 --> 01:25:18.458
He's a man

01:25:18.536 --> 01:25:20.731
He's just a man

01:25:22.106 --> 01:25:24.165
He is not a king

01:25:26.377 --> 01:25:28.845
He's just the same

01:25:28.913 --> 01:25:32.713
As anyone I know

01:25:35.219 --> 01:25:37.813
He scares me so

01:25:40.324 --> 01:25:42.758
When he's cold and dead

01:25:45.262 --> 01:25:47.958
Will he let me be
Does he love

01:25:48.032 --> 01:25:50.865
Does he love me too

01:25:50.935 --> 01:25:53.631
Does he care for me

01:26:18.462 --> 01:26:21.920
My mind is--
It's in darkness.

01:26:23.701 --> 01:26:27.102

01:27:54.692 --> 01:27:59.857
So long, Judas

01:28:02.032 --> 01:28:06.833
So long, Judas

01:28:10.074 --> 01:28:16.411
And so, the king
is once again my guest

01:28:17.581 --> 01:28:20.277
And why is this

01:28:20.351 --> 01:28:23.184
Was Herod unimpressed

01:28:24.355 --> 01:28:26.789
[ Caiaphas ]
We turn to Rome

01:28:26.857 --> 01:28:29.417
To sentence Nazareth

01:28:31.528 --> 01:28:34.258
We have no law

01:28:34.331 --> 01:28:38.199
To put a man to death

01:28:41.005 --> 01:28:43.974
We need him crucified

01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:46.601
It's all
you have to do

01:28:46.677 --> 01:28:52.946

It's all you have to do

You have been brought here

Manacled, beaten,
by your own people.

01:29:00.257 --> 01:29:03.226
Do you have the first idea
why you deserve it ?

01:29:03.294 --> 01:29:07.025
Listen, King of the Jews
Where is your kingdom

01:29:07.097 --> 01:29:10.294
Look at me
Am I a Jew

01:29:10.367 --> 01:29:12.858
I have no kingdom.

01:29:12.937 --> 01:29:15.735
In this world,
I'm through.

01:29:15.806 --> 01:29:18.900
- Talk to me, Jesus Christ
- There may be a kingdom...

01:29:18.976 --> 01:29:20.944
for me somewhere.

01:29:21.011 --> 01:29:22.945
If you only knew.

01:29:24.348 --> 01:29:27.374
- Then you are a king.
- It's you that say I am

01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:30.284
I look for truth
and find that I get damned

01:29:30.354 --> 01:29:33.221
And what is truth
ls truth unchanging law

01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:35.850

Are mine the same as yours

[ Crowd ]
Crucify him ! Crucify him !

01:29:38.529 --> 01:29:41.191
What do you mean ?
You'd crucify your king ?

01:29:41.265 --> 01:29:43.290
[ Crowd ]
We have no king but Caesar

01:29:43.367 --> 01:29:46.302
He's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.

01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:49.134
We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him

01:29:49.206 --> 01:29:52.300
Well, this is new.
Respect for Caesar !

01:29:52.376 --> 01:29:54.810
Until now, this has been
noticeably lacking.

Why is he different ?

01:29:57.514 --> 01:30:00.608
You Jews produce messiahs

01:30:00.684 --> 01:30:04.984
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do

01:30:25.609 --> 01:30:27.577
I'll agree
he's mad

01:30:27.644 --> 01:30:30.010
Ought to be locked up

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.063
But that is not a reason
to destroy him

01:30:33.196 --> 01:30:37.633
He's a sad little man
not a king or god

01:30:37.701 --> 01:30:40.829
Not a thief
I need a crime

You hate us more than him

We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him

I see no reason
I find no evil

This man is harmless
so why does he upset you

01:31:06.863 --> 01:31:09.423
He's just misguided
Thinks he's important

01:31:09.499 --> 01:31:12.866
But to keep you vultures happy,
I shall flog him !
