-Whoa! Okay.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.495
-MAN: I said, stay back.
-That's not necessary.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.996
-Let's just talk.
-The FBI?

37:28.038 --> 37:29.498
Yeah, really.
You're not even American.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.208
What, is-is he even hurt?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.502
What is this?
Some kind of a scam?

37:35.045 --> 37:37.756
If I wanted
to boost some wheels,

37:37.798 --> 37:40.676
it wouldn't be a fuckin'
Hyundai, you daft cunt.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.803
This is a stand-your-ground
state. You stay back!

37:42.844 --> 37:45.263
Oh, you can stand
wherever the fuck you want.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.641
-I'm taking your keys.
-Butcher, stop.

37:47.683 --> 37:50.102
Buddy, just put the gun down.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.354
-I said stay back.
-I said... put it down!

37:52.396 --> 37:54.189

38:02.864 --> 38:04.950
(Starlight sighs)

38:06.994 --> 38:08.996

38:20.257 --> 38:23.635
You couldn't just listen to me
and stay back?!

38:33.311 --> 38:36.148
BUTCHER:
Come on.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.191

38:58.712 --> 39:01.006
(Hughie grunting)

39:30.035 --> 39:31.495
Is this the right time
to go shopping?

39:31.536 --> 39:32.704
FRENCHIE:
One, why not?

39:32.746 --> 39:35.499
And <i>deux...</i>

39:35.540 --> 39:37.375
this is good news.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.419
What do you mean by that?

39:42.214 --> 39:44.800
Some aerated propofol...

39:44.841 --> 39:48.512
some other odds and ends,
I'll make a knockout bomb.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.639
Even for Supes.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.434
MOTHER'S MILK:
Okay.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.235
Why are we still alive?

40:04.528 --> 40:07.197
-Dumb luck?
-FRENCHIE: No.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.824
I mean that night.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.284
We went underground for months.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.956
But you never came for us.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.083
Not you, not Homelander.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.501
Why?

40:19.543 --> 40:21.628
You're disappointed
we didn't kill you?

40:21.670 --> 40:24.840
I thought The Seven
always retaliates, no?

40:24.881 --> 40:26.800
You're nobody.

40:26.842 --> 40:28.468
Not worth it.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.603
You didn't tell them, did you?

40:41.606 --> 40:44.234
Why wouldn't you tell them?

40:44.276 --> 40:45.652
Who says I didn't?

40:45.694 --> 40:47.737
I figured you'd boast about it

40:47.779 --> 40:50.407
to Homelander,
must've been thrilling for you.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.325
I'm not a fucking animal.

40:52.367 --> 40:55.120

Only a fucking animal
would do what you did.

40:55.162 --> 40:56.538

40:56.580 --> 40:58.957
-You murdered innocent children.
-Shut the fuck up.

40:58.999 --> 41:01.501
You watched them burn alive,
crying for their mama.

41:01.543 --> 41:04.421
If that's not an animal,
then what is, huh?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.423
I didn't know!

41:12.596 --> 41:14.598
I didn't know they were
gonna be in that bed.

41:14.639 --> 41:17.309
It was supposed to be your boss.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.944
Then they started screaming.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.412
But it was too late.

41:38.830 --> 41:42.209
So what, are we supposed
to feel bad for you now?

41:42.250 --> 41:43.835
Fuck you.

41:43.877 --> 41:45.462
LAMPLIGHTER:
I don't want anything from you.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.796
But you...

41:48.215 --> 41:50.884
I saw you following me
that night.

41:52.761 --> 41:56.223
And then you disappeared.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.309
I keep asking myself, why...

41:59.351 --> 42:02.479
why didn't you stop me?

42:07.817 --> 42:10.946
Why didn't you?

42:10.987 --> 42:13.406
Good question.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.454

He's ODing.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.689
I-I don't know what he took.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.065
-Take him to the hospital!
<i>-Please, come now!</i>

42:47.107 --> 42:48.817

42:55.991 --> 42:57.033

42:59.119 --> 43:01.871

43:12.090 --> 43:13.341
CHERIE:
No.

43:23.435 --> 43:25.312
Look at me, look at me,
you went out.

43:25.353 --> 43:26.896
Okay, can you sit?

43:26.938 --> 43:28.356
Come on!

43:28.398 --> 43:29.941
Come on, <i>mon ami, </i>come on.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.320
He's okay.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.655
Okay, you stay with him.

43:35.697 --> 43:37.657
-You keep him talking, okay?
-What?

43:39.034 --> 43:40.118
Where are you going?

43:40.160 --> 43:41.536
Don't let him fall asleep.

43:41.578 --> 43:43.038
-What...?
-I told you I have something.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.456
Something more important
than this?

43:44.497 --> 43:45.707
More important than <i>us?</i>

43:45.749 --> 43:47.792
Cherie, I cannot
do this right now.

43:47.834 --> 43:50.253
Okay?

43:50.295 --> 43:53.381
Please, stay with him!

43:53.423 --> 43:55.091
Fine, you want to go...

43:55.133 --> 43:56.885

43:56.926 --> 43:59.763

We don't give a shit.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.223

44:12.442 --> 44:14.444
I'll be back.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.326
<i>Je te promets.</i>

44:23.036 --> 44:25.872
-(moaning)
-He's burning up.

44:25.914 --> 44:27.540
I'm going as fast as I can.

44:32.295 --> 44:34.214
I appreciate
what you done back there.

44:34.255 --> 44:35.632
Oh, thanks.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.634
Your approval means
everything to me.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.594
And some sarcasm
to stick the landing.

44:39.636 --> 44:40.678
Nice one.

44:43.098 --> 44:44.724
You didn't have a choice.

44:48.186 --> 44:51.272
You know what I was thinking,
when I was looking at him?

44:53.441 --> 44:57.278
"Why'd you pull a gun,
you stupid fuck?"

44:57.320 --> 44:59.697
That's all.

45:01.699 --> 45:05.578
Maybe once I would've
cried over him, but...

45:05.620 --> 45:09.249
now he was just another
person in our way.

45:15.547 --> 45:16.840
No.

45:16.881 --> 45:18.758
-No what?
-No to that

45:18.800 --> 45:22.429
fucking look of quiet respect

45:22.470 --> 45:24.389
or approval or whatever that is.

45:24.431 --> 45:26.599
I don't want it.

45:29.769 --> 45:31.729
We're nothing alike.

45:31.771 --> 45:33.773
Nothing.

45:41.781 --> 45:43.783
(machinery whirring)

45:48.204 --> 45:51.082
You really think
that's gonna work?

45:52.125 --> 45:53.460
I think so.

46:02.469 --> 46:04.721
You know, they're not
trying to make Supes here.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.598
These people are test subjects.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.266
They're trying
to stabilize the V.

46:08.308 --> 46:09.642
Explain.

46:09.684 --> 46:12.187
Infants handle it best,
but adults?

46:12.228 --> 46:14.189
I mean, you saw what happens--
sometimes you get powers,

46:14.230 --> 46:16.816
sometimes you get a freak,
sometimes you just explode.

46:16.858 --> 46:19.319
Vought is trying
to stabilize it,

46:19.360 --> 46:21.571
so that you put the V
in any adult arm,

46:21.613 --> 46:24.782
anywhere, anytime, you get
a solid Supe, solid powers.

46:24.824 --> 46:27.160
<i>Putain.</i>

46:27.202 --> 46:29.621
Okay, so...

46:29.662 --> 46:32.790
a thousand more Supes...
100,000?

46:32.832 --> 46:34.709
Why? Why would Vought do that?

46:34.751 --> 46:36.503
It's gonna fuck up their movies,
their merchandising...

46:36.544 --> 46:38.838
They don't tell me.

46:38.880 --> 46:42.342
They just make me
burn the evidence.

46:42.383 --> 46:44.928
Okay?

46:55.855 --> 46:58.983
My, uh...

46:59.025 --> 47:01.444
my best friend

47:01.486 --> 47:04.239
OD'd and I left

47:04.280 --> 47:06.699
to save him that night.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.328
Why I didn't stop you.

47:10.370 --> 47:12.455
You were at a party.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.958
I was away for 30 minutes.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.919
Came back, you were gone.

47:22.048 --> 47:23.800
Did he live?

47:23.841 --> 47:25.843
Your friend?

47:27.470 --> 47:30.390
<i>Oui.</i>

47:30.431 --> 47:34.102
But I never saw him again,
and...

47:34.143 --> 47:36.521
then, uh, he died
a few months later.

47:36.563 --> 47:38.147
Another overdose.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.482
Are you serious?

47:39.524 --> 47:41.359
Frenchie, wh...?

47:41.401 --> 47:43.653
Why didn't you ever tell us?

47:46.656 --> 47:48.825
After all these years, man?

47:48.866 --> 47:51.995

53:28.456 --> 53:29.624
<i>-It's okay.
</i>-Hey,

53:29.665 --> 53:31.918
did you say Sugarfish?

53:31.959 --> 53:35.504
<i>WOMAN 2:
Please save us!</i>

53:35.546 --> 53:37.757
<i>-MAEVE: Take these two!

53:37.798 --> 53:39.967
<i>-Just these two! Please!
-No! What, so they can tell</i>

53:40.009 --> 53:42.470

53:42.511 --> 53:43.971

<i>(crying)</i>

53:51.270 --> 53:52.980
<i>I love you.</i>

53:53.022 --> 53:55.566
<i>(shuddering)
Tell the boys I love them.</i>

53:55.608 --> 53:56.984
<i>(passengers screaming)</i>

53:57.026 --> 53:59.695
I'm gonna show that
to Homelander.

54:01.364 --> 54:02.990
And...

54:03.032 --> 54:05.993
he's either gonna leave us alone

54:06.035 --> 54:08.287
or I'm gonna put it on CNN.

54:15.127 --> 54:16.253
Elena.

54:16.295 --> 54:18.631
This is our out.

54:22.051 --> 54:24.470
I was scared. I...

54:28.891 --> 54:30.434
I know
I should have stood up to him.

54:30.476 --> 54:32.019
I know that.

54:32.061 --> 54:36.065
Elena, I watched
a plane full of people die.

54:42.488 --> 54:45.449
Why are you looking at me
like that?

54:45.491 --> 54:47.118
(exhales)

54:47.159 --> 54:48.869
(birds chirping)

54:48.911 --> 54:51.122
Yeah. Right.

54:51.163 --> 54:52.206
Yo.

54:52.248 --> 54:54.417
Close stitch, but Hughie's okay.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.584
Oh, <i>bien.</i>

54:55.626 --> 54:57.169
Hey,

54:57.211 --> 54:59.755
tell Butcher about the thick
penis around your neck.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.173
(whispers):
Fuck you.

55:01.215 --> 55:03.843
Nah, nah, nah, it's just
Frenchie being Frenchie.

55:14.103 --> 55:16.522
I am sorry.

55:19.942 --> 55:22.903
For a long time,

55:22.945 --> 55:26.866
I was trying to save you.

55:28.325 --> 55:29.702
I thought, uh,

55:29.744 --> 55:31.454
if I did, somehow,

55:31.495 --> 55:35.791
that would make up
for the things I've done.

55:37.376 --> 55:41.130
You never asked to be saved.

55:43.424 --> 55:47.303
You cannot absolve my, uh, sins.

55:47.344 --> 55:50.389
(exhales)
No one can.

55:50.431 --> 55:53.142
I know this now.

55:53.184 --> 55:56.353
So...

55:56.395 --> 55:58.314
I leave you alone.

56:01.525 --> 56:03.944
(vehicle approaching)

56:14.080 --> 56:16.082
Got to go.

56:20.920 --> 56:21.879
(engine shuts off)

56:21.921 --> 56:23.798
(door opens, closes)

56:25.174 --> 56:27.384
MOTHER'S MILK:
Colonel.

56:27.426 --> 56:28.886
Marvin,

56:28.928 --> 56:31.138
where is he?

56:31.180 --> 56:33.182
This way.

56:35.559 --> 56:38.104
Madame Mallory.

56:38.145 --> 56:41.107
Uh, I know I wasn't welcome
at the funeral,

56:41.148 --> 56:44.318
so, all these years, I
couldn't offer my condolences...

56:44.360 --> 56:46.403
Where is he?

56:53.244 --> 56:55.204
(exhales)
Why isn't this man restrained?

56:55.246 --> 56:56.622
No need. I wanted to come.

56:56.664 --> 57:00.209
I don't want to hear
a single goddamn word from you.

57:02.962 --> 57:05.297
(breathing heavily)

57:05.339 --> 57:06.882
(whispering):
I thought this was behind me.

57:06.924 --> 57:08.926
But it's not.

57:10.886 --> 57:13.180
It never is.
(crying)

57:13.222 --> 57:15.975
Then let's both be done with it.

57:16.016 --> 57:18.978
(shuddering)

57:19.019 --> 57:21.605
I know what you have to do.

57:23.983 --> 57:25.860
Do it.

57:25.901 --> 57:27.862
You'd be doing me a favor.

57:27.903 --> 57:29.321
Do it.

57:30.781 --> 57:33.159
Madame, please.

57:33.200 --> 57:35.619
If I may?

57:36.871 --> 57:38.247
Besides you,

57:38.289 --> 57:40.332
no one wanted him dead more
than me,

57:40.374 --> 57:42.585
but I am begging you
for his life.

57:48.924 --> 57:51.677
I have no choice.

57:52.887 --> 57:55.848
It won't help you.

57:55.890 --> 57:59.560
All you'd be doing
is ending his torment.

58:03.355 --> 58:06.984
You cannot punish him
as much as he punishes himself.

58:09.737 --> 58:12.031
Trust me.

58:15.534 --> 58:17.286
So...

58:19.121 --> 58:21.707
...what exactly

58:21.749 --> 58:25.252
are you proposing we do
with him?

58:32.593 --> 58:34.261
Hey.

58:35.596 --> 58:37.389
I'm so glad you're here.

58:37.431 --> 58:38.807
I want to apologize.

58:38.849 --> 58:40.309
Please, just let me explain.

58:40.351 --> 58:44.855
Flap, flap, flap
goes that little mouth of yours.

58:46.690 --> 58:50.694
You remember you told me
that you don't break easily?

58:52.112 --> 58:54.782
Well, I've been thinking
about that.

58:57.326 --> 58:59.161
A lot.

59:00.204 --> 59:03.165
I will never lie to you again.

59:03.207 --> 59:05.918
I will tell you everything.

59:07.336 --> 59:09.255
(exhales)

59:11.882 --> 59:14.385
Starting with this.

59:37.950 --> 59:39.243
Your grandmother?

59:41.120 --> 59:42.830
My daughter.

59:46.250 --> 59:49.628
Chloe. She died of Alzheimer's
a few years ago.

59:51.964 --> 59:53.507
How old are you?

59:53.549 --> 59:56.593
I was born in 1919.

59:56.635 --> 59:58.137
In Berlin.

1:00:10.441 --> 1:00:12.526
Is that you with...?

1:00:12.568 --> 1:00:14.528
Heinrich Himmler.

1:00:14.570 --> 1:00:16.447
He was a lovely dancer.

1:00:16.488 --> 1:00:18.824
And that's Goebbels.

1:00:18.866 --> 1:00:20.576
And...

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:23.954
the most important man
in the room...

1:00:35.174 --> 1:00:37.634
Frederick Vought.

1:00:39.928 --> 1:00:44.016
He gave me the first successful
V injection.

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:47.227
He taught me everything.

1:00:48.604 --> 1:00:49.980
And then we fell in love,

1:00:50.022 --> 1:00:51.315
and he gave me a daughter.

1:00:51.357 --> 1:00:53.942
He made me,

1:00:53.984 --> 1:00:57.404
and his genius made you.

1:01:06.955 --> 1:01:10.584
Frederick didn't care
about all the fans or stardom

1:01:10.626 --> 1:01:13.587
or any of that shallow bullshit.

1:01:13.629 --> 1:01:17.508
We are in a war for the culture.

1:01:17.549 --> 1:01:20.511
The other races
are grinding us down

1:01:20.552 --> 1:01:22.346
and taking
what is rightfully ours,

1:01:22.388 --> 1:01:24.765
but we can fight back.
(exhales)

1:01:24.807 --> 1:01:26.934
With an army of supermen,

1:01:26.975 --> 1:01:29.269
millions strong.

1:01:29.311 --> 1:01:33.023
Because that is
Vought's true destiny.

1:01:33.065 --> 1:01:37.903
And <i>you </i>will be the man
who will lead us.

1:01:42.616 --> 1:01:47.454
You are everything
that we dreamed of.

1:01:50.249 --> 1:01:53.919
So I love you
with all of my heart.

1:01:55.003 --> 1:01:57.673
How could I not?

1:02:03.011 --> 1:02:06.640
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

1:02:06.682 --> 1:02:09.435
And then I found you.

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:12.980
We found each other.

1:02:14.356 --> 1:02:16.358
And now neither of us

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.777
has to be alone ever again.

1:02:20.070 --> 1:02:22.281
And that...

1:02:22.322 --> 1:02:24.908
is the truth.
