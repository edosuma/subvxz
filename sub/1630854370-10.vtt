04:14.310 --> 04:15.172

04:15.172 --> 04:16.689
Based on the position
of the body-

04:16.689 --> 04:18.172
I think she fell
from up there.

04:18.172 --> 04:20.344
There were no clear
defensive wounds.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.034
But that railing up there
is at least four feet high.

04:23.034 --> 04:24.793

fall over it.

pronounced dead.

By who?

04:44.862 --> 04:46.275

04:46.275 --> 04:47.655
No, a friend of
the deceased.

05:06.827 --> 05:08.655

05:08.655 --> 05:09.793

05:09.793 --> 05:11.517
when they realized
she was with our group.

05:13.310 --> 05:14.379

to see this, honey.

05:39.000 --> 05:39.827

05:40.517 --> 05:42.413
The ladies went
to a strip show.

05:42.931 --> 05:44.517

05:44.517 --> 05:45.655

whisky tasting.

05:46.310 --> 05:47.241
Taylor.

05:47.241 --> 05:48.896
What time did you
and the bridesmaids-

05:48.896 --> 05:50.551
get back to
the hotel?

05:50.551 --> 05:51.241
Around 2:15.

05:53.655 --> 05:55.172
But she left
the party early.

05:56.034 --> 05:56.793
Why's that?

05:56.793 --> 05:58.068
She sent
me a text at 1:00-

05:58.068 --> 05:59.965
saying she wasn't
feeling well.

05:59.965 --> 06:00.931
A text?

06:00.931 --> 06:02.344
Why not just
tell you?

06:02.344 --> 06:03.172
I don't know.

06:03.172 --> 06:05.034
I didn't think
anything of it, but-

06:08.793 --> 06:09.758
What are you thinking?

06:11.862 --> 06:13.793
Luisa was a
recovering addict.

06:13.793 --> 06:15.379
Opiates and alcohol.

06:18.448 --> 06:20.241
Excuse us
for a moment.

06:27.413 --> 06:29.758
Oh Nate!

06:32.068 --> 06:32.931
What have you got?

06:34.034 --> 06:34.724
Yeah.

06:36.379 --> 06:37.034
Good job pal.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.482
Huh.

06:46.827 --> 06:48.206
Rashid might be
on to something.

07:01.137 --> 07:01.758
Hey buddy!

07:01.758 --> 07:02.448
Good morning.

07:04.448 --> 07:05.724
Hey Rex.

07:05.724 --> 07:07.896
Someone woke up on the wrong
side of the bed this morning.

07:07.896 --> 07:08.965
We had an
early start.

07:08.965 --> 07:10.068
Yeah, so I heard.

07:10.068 --> 07:11.206
I'm just making
my way-

07:11.206 --> 07:13.620
through the hotel
CCTV right now.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.689
Anything interesting?

07:14.689 --> 07:17.034
Well there's no
footage of Luisa's fall.

07:17.034 --> 07:18.482
But I did
find this.

07:26.965 --> 07:27.793
Where's she headed?

07:28.103 --> 07:28.724
Presumably-

07:28.724 --> 07:29.758
to the mezzanine.

07:30.172 --> 07:30.827
Hotel staff found her-

07:30.827 --> 07:33.034
ten minutes later.

07:33.034 --> 07:34.000
Yeah well the
question is-

07:34.000 --> 07:35.241
what happened within
those ten minutes right?

07:35.241 --> 07:37.068
Yeah and why was
she acting so weird?

07:37.068 --> 07:38.517
This might help.

07:38.517 --> 07:39.517
The pill-

07:39.517 --> 07:41.068
Rex found.

07:41.068 --> 07:42.310
It's high-dose codeine.

07:43.620 --> 07:44.517
You think
she was high?

07:44.517 --> 07:46.275
Luisa was a
recovering addict.

07:46.275 --> 07:47.000
It makes sense.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.068
That's one possibility.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.965
But we can't sure the
codeine belonged to Luisa.

07:49.965 --> 07:50.689
I mean-

07:50.689 --> 07:52.206
Rex found it in
a public place.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.103
Sure, but given
her history-

07:55.103 --> 07:56.482
Yeah but I mean,
you said so yourself-

07:56.482 --> 07:57.965
the railing on the
mezzanine was so high-

07:57.965 --> 07:59.379
it would be hard
to fall off of-

07:59.379 --> 08:01.689
under the
influence or not.

08:01.689 --> 08:02.517
That's true.

08:02.517 --> 08:04.241
Toxicology will
tell us for sure.

08:04.241 --> 08:05.965
Keep me
posted on that okay?

08:05.965 --> 08:08.965
I'm doing the new alt methods
workshop this weekend.

08:22.896 --> 08:24.344
I can't stop
talking about it.

08:24.344 --> 08:25.275
I hope you're ready!

08:28.965 --> 08:31.206
They assume that
Financial Crimes is boring.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.655
But we just put somebody
away for murder.

08:32.655 --> 08:34.517
You may have heard of the
Tropiks nightclub case?

08:34.517 --> 08:35.206
Right?

08:35.206 --> 08:36.241
Everybody assumed-

08:36.241 --> 08:37.758
that it was just a simple
case of arson right?

08:37.758 --> 08:40.482
And so my team found a
key piece of evidence.

08:40.482 --> 08:41.172
Your team?

08:41.172 --> 08:42.068
I'm so proud.

08:42.448 --> 08:43.172
Right.

08:46.448 --> 08:47.103
Superintendent Donovan.

08:47.103 --> 08:48.482
Superintendent Lewis.

08:48.482 --> 08:51.551
I heard that Tropiks nightclub
case was a tough nut to crack.

08:51.551 --> 08:53.241
I'm really impressed
with how well you did-

08:53.241 --> 08:56.344
without any inter-
departmental assistance.

08:56.344 --> 08:57.034
Okay everyone!

hurt me huh?

09:13.758 --> 09:14.448
Mmmm.

09:15.551 --> 09:16.482
Looks like we're
stuck together.

09:25.793 --> 09:28.172
Luisa and I have been best
friends since kindergarten.

09:28.172 --> 09:30.103
I can't believe
she's gone.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.034
Listen I know this
is very difficult.

09:38.034 --> 09:39.517
But given the
circumstances-

09:39.517 --> 09:41.172
I do need
to ask about-

09:41.172 --> 09:43.620
Luisa's history
of addiction.

09:44.103 --> 09:45.448
You said she
was in recovery?

09:45.448 --> 09:47.965
For almost a year.

09:47.965 --> 09:49.482
It was her
longest stretch.

09:50.827 --> 09:52.655
She'd struggled
since high school.

09:53.310 --> 09:56.137
But this time
felt different.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.620
She had a job.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.344
She had a place
of her own.

09:59.344 --> 10:01.655
I really thought
she'd beaten it.

10:02.862 --> 10:04.103
So she was in
a good place.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.206
Any mental health issues?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.931
Did she have any
serious stressors?

10:07.931 --> 10:09.206
No!

10:09.206 --> 10:10.827
She was the happiest
I've ever seen her.

10:14.689 --> 10:16.206
Would it be all right
if she lied down?

10:16.965 --> 10:17.965
Of course.

10:17.965 --> 10:18.965
Why don't you-

10:18.965 --> 10:20.000
take a little
bit of time.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.034
We'll give you
some space.

10:21.034 --> 10:22.068
It's okay.

10:24.965 --> 10:25.655
Poor Taylor.

10:27.413 --> 10:28.275
Would you agree-

10:28.275 --> 10:30.000
that Luisa's recovery
was on track?

10:31.137 --> 10:32.517
I mean, I didn't
know her super well.

10:33.172 --> 10:33.827
But?

10:37.413 --> 10:39.172
Taylor had on rose-
coloured glasses.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.310
Ah.

10:40.310 --> 10:41.206
The rest
of us knew-

10:41.206 --> 10:42.689
that the cycle was
going to start again.

10:42.689 --> 10:44.827
I just wish she hadn't
picked Taylor's big night.

10:44.827 --> 10:48.172
Did you actually witness Luisa
drinking or taking drugs?

10:49.793 --> 10:50.965
No.

10:50.965 --> 10:52.931
But she started acting all
funny after the strip show.

10:52.931 --> 10:53.586
So I figured-

10:53.586 --> 10:55.137
Meaning she seemed high?

10:55.137 --> 10:57.172
Look, I don't know.

10:57.172 --> 10:59.275
You should probably talk
to Quincy about this.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.275
Who's Quincy?

11:01.275 --> 11:02.931
Taylor's other bridesmaid.

11:03.862 --> 11:05.172
Where is she
right now?

11:05.172 --> 11:06.655
She's sleeping off
her hangover.

11:06.655 --> 11:07.724
I tried to
wake her.

11:07.724 --> 11:08.931
But she was
out cold.

11:08.931 --> 11:11.517
Anyway, the last time I saw
Luisa, they were together.

11:12.586 --> 11:14.517
Have her call me
when she wakes up.

11:14.620 --> 11:15.896
♪Cause we're
summer lovin'♪

11:16.862 --> 11:17.896
I hate
to say it.

11:17.896 --> 11:20.517
But it sounds like
death by misadventure.

11:20.517 --> 11:21.586
I'm not so sure.

11:22.344 --> 11:23.551
Hannah said that Luisa-

11:24.586 --> 11:26.793
she got funny after
the strip show.

11:26.793 --> 11:29.551
But that doesn't mean
she was on drugs.

11:29.551 --> 11:32.655
Sure, but when you add
the codeine on scene-

11:32.655 --> 11:33.827
and what Rashid said-

11:34.551 --> 11:35.724
Yeah but what
about Taylor?

11:35.724 --> 11:36.758
She knew her best.

11:36.758 --> 11:38.310
And she said
that she was-

11:39.827 --> 11:41.724
she was sure that Luisa
had gotten sober for good.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.206
I wonder how many times
she'd believed that before.

11:49.482 --> 11:50.724
Anything bothering you?

11:52.068 --> 11:53.172
Why do you ask?

11:53.172 --> 11:53.827
You're not usually-

11:53.827 --> 11:54.758
so quick to-

11:56.241 --> 11:56.931
judge.

11:58.724 --> 11:59.413
Oh!

11:59.413 --> 12:00.517
I wasn't judging.

12:01.655 --> 12:02.724
Luisa relapsing-

12:02.724 --> 12:04.724
is the simplest explanation
given the evidence.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.413
We don't have
all the evidence.

12:06.413 --> 12:08.068
We still don't have
the tox report.

12:08.068 --> 12:09.482
♪And we're breakin'

12:13.137 --> 12:14.103
You know, you're right.

12:14.103 --> 12:14.896
I should go see-

12:14.896 --> 12:16.000
what the
hold up is.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.310
Okay, let me
just grab the bill.

12:17.310 --> 12:18.413
No no no,
it's fine.

12:18.413 --> 12:19.758
You take your time.

12:20.379 --> 12:21.310
I'll see you later.

12:22.620 --> 12:23.655
Yeah, see you.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.034
I know, I know.

12:44.586 --> 12:45.793
You recognize this
woman from last night?

12:46.482 --> 12:47.724
Sure.

12:47.724 --> 12:49.758
You don't forget someone with
a twelve hundred dollar tab-

12:49.758 --> 12:51.448
and two declined
credit cards.

12:52.482 --> 12:53.275
Declined?

12:53.275 --> 12:54.344
Did she find
another way to pay?

12:55.034 --> 12:56.068
No.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.724
She had to get someone
else to settle up for her.

12:57.724 --> 12:59.965
You have any
idea who?

12:59.965 --> 13:00.965

14:04.034 --> 14:05.689
It's Vitamin B12.

14:05.689 --> 14:06.724
Tay and I
discovered it-

14:06.724 --> 14:09.034
as a hangover remedy
in nursing school.

14:10.103 --> 14:12.000
So the whole wedding party are
medical professionals then?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.103
Yep.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.068
Well-

14:14.068 --> 14:15.862
except for Luisa.

14:15.862 --> 14:18.758
At the Upper Falls Hospital
they call us the fab five.

14:18.758 --> 14:19.448
Huh.

14:20.172 --> 14:21.275
You're close with Taylor.

14:21.275 --> 14:23.517
That must mean that you
probably knew Luisa pretty well.

14:24.586 --> 14:26.827
She was around
a lot, yeah.

14:29.206 --> 14:30.000
Was that a problem?

14:30.000 --> 14:30.655
No.

14:30.655 --> 14:32.206
But like-

14:32.206 --> 14:35.000
No one understood why Taylor
stayed so tight with her-

14:35.000 --> 14:36.482
after all
that she did.

14:36.482 --> 14:39.000
She should've ditched her
after rehab stint two.

14:39.000 --> 14:39.689
Quincy.

14:40.758 --> 14:42.758
Sorry, I've got no filter
when I'm hung over.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.896
Huh.

14:43.896 --> 14:44.586
It's-

14:45.448 --> 14:46.413
Taylor had
a great job.

14:46.965 --> 14:48.379
And she was
getting married.

14:48.379 --> 14:50.000
And she had us.

14:51.827 --> 14:53.000
Luisa's a burnout.

14:53.103 --> 14:54.586
What she means-

14:54.586 --> 14:57.379
is Luisa was on a different
path than Taylor.

14:57.379 --> 14:58.724
Oh, I need coffee.

15:03.551 --> 15:04.586
Hannah said-

15:04.586 --> 15:05.862
that she saw
you with Luisa-

15:05.862 --> 15:07.827
right before Luisa
left the bar.

15:07.827 --> 15:08.965
How did she seem?

15:10.068 --> 15:10.689
I don't know.

15:10.689 --> 15:12.517
I was pretty wasted.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.000
You did pay her tab after
her cards were declined.

15:16.413 --> 15:17.586
Did she give an
explanation for that?

15:17.586 --> 15:20.448
Luisa said that she
was behind on her bills.

15:20.448 --> 15:22.310
But I don't know.

15:22.310 --> 15:25.206
To me, that's like a huge red
flag that she was using again.

15:26.448 --> 15:27.793
But it was fine.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.586
I mean, I'm happy
to shell out-

15:29.586 --> 15:31.620
to celebrate Tay's
last night of freedom.

15:31.620 --> 15:34.758
I kind of figured that I'd
have to step up at some point.

15:36.551 --> 15:37.206
How so?

15:37.206 --> 15:38.137
There was
just no way-

15:38.137 --> 15:40.827
that Luisa was going
to keep it together-

15:40.827 --> 15:42.517
like a Maid of Honour
really should.

15:51.758 --> 15:52.413
Joe.

15:52.689 --> 15:53.448
You're the target.

15:53.448 --> 15:54.517
You're agitated.

15:54.517 --> 15:55.965
You've got a
hostage at knifepoint.

15:55.965 --> 15:58.068
Vanessa, you've got to
step in and talk him down.

15:58.068 --> 16:01.275
Or SWAT will move in and
take him out with force.

16:01.896 --> 16:03.172
Here's a script
to get started.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.000
And remember
the Which Way.

16:06.068 --> 16:07.034
Wavelength.

16:07.034 --> 16:07.931
Heed.

16:07.931 --> 16:08.620
Influence

16:08.620 --> 16:09.310
Change.

16:09.310 --> 16:10.517
Heal.

16:10.517 --> 16:12.655
Start by getting on the same
wavelength as your target.

16:12.655 --> 16:14.413
Joe, you're free
to improvise.

16:14.413 --> 16:16.241
But don't make
it easy for her.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.551
Oh I wouldn't
dream of it.

16:20.517 --> 16:21.896
Help me understand.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.206
What brought you
to this moment?

16:24.206 --> 16:25.551
It started when a
colleague took credit-

16:25.551 --> 16:27.379
for work that
my team did.

16:27.379 --> 16:28.034
Come on Joe.

16:28.034 --> 16:29.103
Be serious.

16:29.103 --> 16:30.137
I am being serious.

16:30.137 --> 16:31.827
I am drawing from
real life experience-

16:31.827 --> 16:33.034
to enhance my character.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.551
I learned that in
high school drama class.

16:34.551 --> 16:35.758
I played Hamlet.

16:35.758 --> 16:36.551
I was brilliant.

16:37.655 --> 16:39.551
The Tropiks
case was ours-

16:39.551 --> 16:42.206
until you all just pulled
it out from under us.

16:42.206 --> 16:43.241
The Crown gave
us that case-

16:43.241 --> 16:44.655
because it was
falling apart.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.689
Yeah but that's not
on Financial Crimes!

16:46.689 --> 16:48.862
The defense's forensics
expert were the people that-

16:48.862 --> 16:49.931
That is not on
me, Vanessa!

16:49.931 --> 16:50.586
You know that.

16:50.586 --> 16:51.379
Really?

16:51.379 --> 16:52.517
Because you know-

16:52.517 --> 16:54.793
heaven forbid you should
take a little responsibility.

16:54.793 --> 16:55.448
Responsibility?

16:55.448 --> 16:56.172
That's rich.

16:56.172 --> 16:57.241
If you want
to talk about-

16:57.241 --> 16:58.103
Sounds like someone's-

16:58.103 --> 17:00.000
influencing their
target negatively.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.068
No- no no no.

17:01.068 --> 17:02.482
We were just actually
taking a break there.

17:02.482 --> 17:03.379
There are no breaks-

17:03.379 --> 17:04.793
in a real-life de-
escalation, Vanessa.

17:05.724 --> 17:06.413
I'm afraid-

17:06.413 --> 17:07.379
your target has
been downed.

17:09.758 --> 17:10.758
Oooh!

17:22.034 --> 17:22.689
Hey.

17:25.689 --> 17:28.862
I wanted to apologize
for being a bit off earlier.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.344
You too-

17:31.344 --> 17:32.413
Rex.

17:32.965 --> 17:33.620
Hi.

17:35.172 --> 17:37.275
Yeah.

17:37.275 --> 17:38.689
I know you
were confused.

17:38.689 --> 17:39.862
This case.

17:39.862 --> 17:40.758
It's um-

17:41.586 --> 17:42.379
hit a nerve.

17:43.206 --> 17:44.482
I didn't realize
it earlier.

17:44.862 --> 17:46.275
Not consciously at least.

17:47.517 --> 17:48.689
Do you want to
talk about it?

17:49.620 --> 17:50.275
No.

17:55.689 --> 17:57.344
But that probably
means I should.

18:02.793 --> 18:05.206
Okay so I had a
friend in university.

18:05.206 --> 18:05.931
Willow.

18:06.931 --> 18:08.517
She was my roommate
in first year.

18:10.068 --> 18:11.241
We were total opposites.

18:11.241 --> 18:12.758
She was in the
music program.

18:14.482 --> 18:15.241
A singer.

18:15.241 --> 18:16.758
God, she was brilliant.

18:18.275 --> 18:20.241
But she had problems
with addiction?

18:20.241 --> 18:21.137
Cocaine.

18:21.137 --> 18:22.482
Speed, alcohol.

18:23.448 --> 18:25.000
She couldn't do
anything in moderation.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.620
She was on and off
the wagon for years.

18:29.620 --> 18:30.620
Just like Luisa.

18:30.620 --> 18:31.310
Yeah.

18:31.310 --> 18:31.965
Every time-

18:31.965 --> 18:34.172
she got clean-

18:34.172 --> 18:35.068
I thought,
this is it.

18:35.068 --> 18:36.103
Okay.

18:36.103 --> 18:38.620
She's finally kicked
it for good.

18:44.793 --> 18:45.793
And then-

18:47.379 --> 18:48.689
the cycle
would repeat.

18:48.689 --> 18:50.689
And I tried to help
her, you know?

18:50.689 --> 18:51.724
I found her
support groups.

18:51.724 --> 18:52.413
I-

18:53.517 --> 18:55.586
I even paid for an in-
patient treatment program.

18:55.586 --> 18:57.482
But none
of it stuck.

18:57.482 --> 18:58.862
And eventually I just-

19:02.068 --> 19:02.827
I just-

19:02.827 --> 19:03.551
I had to-

19:04.689 --> 19:05.689
let her go.

19:07.862 --> 19:08.724
You know?

19:08.724 --> 19:11.344
The roller coaster
was just too much.

19:11.344 --> 19:13.172
Knowing you, that must
have been really difficult.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.206
It was, yeah.

19:17.206 --> 19:22.620
But maybe Luisa had found a way
to keep her demons in check.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.344
We owe her the benefit
of the doubt on that.

19:26.344 --> 19:27.896
Of course.

19:29.241 --> 19:30.379
When
there's a breakdown-

19:30.379 --> 19:31.517
in communication-

19:31.517 --> 19:33.758
sometimes we have to use
physical force to de-escalate.

19:33.758 --> 19:36.965
But physical force
doesn't just mean guns.

19:37.655 --> 19:38.827
There are other
tactics in your arsenal.

19:38.827 --> 19:39.827
Joe and Vanessa here-

19:39.827 --> 19:41.310
are going to help me
show you one right now.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.724
You two ready?

19:42.724 --> 19:43.482
Can't wait.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.379
Okay.

19:44.379 --> 19:45.275
So let's say-

19:45.275 --> 19:46.586
we've gotten
our hostage safe.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.344
Now it's just our
target and his knife.

19:49.344 --> 19:50.034
Right?

19:50.758 --> 19:51.827
Vanessa.

19:51.827 --> 19:53.448
You're going to knock the
weapon from Joe's hand.

19:53.448 --> 19:54.344
You want
to get it-

19:54.344 --> 19:55.862
as far away from
him as possible.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.655
Okay?

19:56.655 --> 19:57.413
Give it a try.

19:57.517 --> 19:58.862
Nice and slow.

20:01.793 --> 20:02.724
Okay good.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.551
Someone's been
eating their Wheaties!

20:04.551 --> 20:05.482
So the knife
is gone.

20:06.551 --> 20:07.862
But Joe's still
a tough guy.

20:07.862 --> 20:09.137
He's going
to hit back.

20:09.137 --> 20:10.206
Probably with a fist.

20:10.206 --> 20:10.896
Right?

20:11.379 --> 20:12.068
So let's say-

20:12.068 --> 20:13.206
Joe goes
to hit you.

20:13.206 --> 20:14.655
Vanessa needs to counter.

20:14.758 --> 20:15.586
Find a way
to get-

20:15.586 --> 20:16.517
Ughh!

20:16.517 --> 20:17.206
behind him yes!

20:17.206 --> 20:18.517
Yes, beautiful work!

20:18.517 --> 20:20.241
That's beautiful work!

20:20.241 --> 20:22.482
That's how we do it
in Financial Crimes.

20:28.172 --> 20:29.206
Jesse.

20:29.206 --> 20:31.827
Do you have Luisa's credit
card statements there?

20:31.827 --> 20:32.827
Your partner's on it.

20:34.517 --> 20:35.275
Yeah, you know what?

20:35.275 --> 20:36.206
Luisa had zero savings.

20:36.206 --> 20:37.551
And her chequing
account's on the low side.

20:37.551 --> 20:38.896
I mean, there are no
regular withdrawals

20:38.896 --> 20:41.931
to suggest that she
was buying any drugs.

20:41.931 --> 20:43.758
Yeah, I don't see
anything here either.

20:43.758 --> 20:46.413
It looks like most of the
charges over the last month-

20:46.413 --> 20:48.034
have been wedding related.

20:48.034 --> 20:50.310
So I mean you think
her financial troubles-

20:50.310 --> 20:52.206
come from her trying to keep
up with her wealthy friends?

20:53.241 --> 20:53.931
Uh-

20:54.517 --> 20:55.310
looks that way.

20:55.310 --> 20:56.344
It just
doesn't get us-

20:56.344 --> 20:59.034
any closer to figuring out
how or why she died.

20:59.344 --> 21:00.241
Maybe not.

21:00.241 --> 21:02.068
But there are some
things we can rule out.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.724
You've got toxicology?

21:04.724 --> 21:07.551
No alcohol or opiates
in her system.

21:08.793 --> 21:09.758
I ran it twice.

21:09.758 --> 21:10.896
She didn't relapse.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.655
That doesn't explain-

21:12.655 --> 21:14.310
her weird behaviour
in the CCTV.

21:14.310 --> 21:15.827
I've got one possibility.

21:15.827 --> 21:16.689
Tests showed-

21:16.689 --> 21:18.620
a slightly elevated
level of GHB-

21:18.620 --> 21:19.620
in her system.

21:19.620 --> 21:20.517
GHB?

21:20.517 --> 21:22.448
Like the date
rape drug GHB?

21:22.448 --> 21:24.034
Yeah, Luisa might
have been roofied.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.413
Someone could have slipped
something into her drink.

21:25.413 --> 21:26.793
Well that may
explain her text-

21:26.793 --> 21:29.172
that she sent
to Taylor-

21:29.172 --> 21:30.689
saying that she
wasn't feeling well.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.275
While we're talking
about date rape drugs-

21:32.275 --> 21:33.103
is it possible-

21:33.103 --> 21:34.586
that she didn't
leave the bar alone?

21:34.586 --> 21:35.517
Because whoever
roofied her-

21:35.517 --> 21:36.586
They may have
killed her.

21:46.275 --> 21:46.931
Hey.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.344
I tossed and
turned all night.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.724
I figured a run
might clear my head.

21:54.758 --> 21:56.689
Are you still
thinking about Willow?

21:56.689 --> 21:57.896
Oh no.

21:58.689 --> 22:00.448
That I know
how to deal with.

22:03.482 --> 22:05.724
I feel guilty about assuming
the worst about Luisa.

22:06.517 --> 22:08.896
Especially now that we
know she didn't relapse.

22:08.896 --> 22:09.758
Thank you.

22:10.862 --> 22:11.586
You know you have nothing
to feel guilty about?

22:11.689 --> 22:12.379
Mm-mmm.

22:12.379 --> 22:13.551
That's not true.

22:14.586 --> 22:17.310
I let my personal feelings
interfere with my work.

22:17.310 --> 22:19.758
Well, our experiences
colour our perspectives.

22:19.758 --> 22:22.034
It's impossible not to.

22:22.724 --> 22:23.965
No, I know.

22:25.827 --> 22:28.517
I feel like I owe
Luisa an apology.

22:32.206 --> 22:34.517
Well I can't
give you that.

22:34.517 --> 22:36.413
But Taylor's coming
in this morning.

22:36.413 --> 22:38.137
Do you want to be
the one to tell her-

22:38.137 --> 22:39.724
that her best friend
didn't relapse?

22:41.586 --> 22:42.689
Yeah I would.

22:44.965 --> 22:45.965
Thank you.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.862
Easy pal.

22:57.758 --> 22:58.620
You're sure?

22:58.620 --> 22:59.896
I ran the
tests myself.

22:59.896 --> 23:02.137
Luisa didn't drink or take drugs
the night of your bachelorette.

23:02.137 --> 23:03.413
In fact, she hadn't
used in months.

23:04.379 --> 23:05.344
How do you know?

23:05.344 --> 23:06.896
I did a hair
follicle test too.

23:06.896 --> 23:09.827
I just thought you'd want
to know that you were right.

23:09.827 --> 23:11.137
She didn't relapse.

23:13.620 --> 23:14.310
Thank you.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.034
Of course.

23:16.655 --> 23:17.482
But wait.

23:17.482 --> 23:19.034
If she wasn't using
when she died-

23:19.034 --> 23:19.896
what happened?

23:19.896 --> 23:21.482
We're hoping you
can help us with that.

23:21.965 --> 23:22.862
Detective Hudson.

23:23.620 --> 23:24.413
Of course.

23:24.413 --> 23:25.517
Of course, I'd
be happy to help.

23:25.517 --> 23:26.724
But I don't
know if I could.

23:26.724 --> 23:28.482
I told you Luisa
left the party early.

23:28.482 --> 23:29.620
Yeah, we know that.

23:29.620 --> 23:30.655
But we think-

23:30.655 --> 23:32.310
someone might have
tried to spike her drink-

23:32.310 --> 23:33.551
before she left.

23:33.551 --> 23:35.896
Did you see her
talking to anyone?

23:35.896 --> 23:37.758
Or was anyone hanging
around the group?

23:37.758 --> 23:38.965
I don't
think so.

23:38.965 --> 23:41.103
I was pretty carried
away by the party.

23:42.413 --> 23:44.310
Luisa took such
good care of us.

23:44.310 --> 23:46.655
Making sure we had
water between drinks.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.000
Hydrate away your
hangover, she'd say.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.275
Sounds like
a good friend.

23:52.310 --> 23:53.344
The best.

23:54.413 --> 23:55.620
I can't believe
I didn't notice-

23:55.620 --> 23:56.793
that she was
in trouble.

23:56.793 --> 23:58.448
It's not your fault.

23:58.448 --> 24:00.206
Somebody can slip something
into a drink so fast.

24:01.793 --> 24:02.896
I'm just thinking-

24:03.517 --> 24:05.068
I have my selfies-

24:05.068 --> 24:07.103
and Quincy's and Hannah's
too from that night.

24:07.103 --> 24:08.758
Maybe they
could help find-

24:08.758 --> 24:09.689
whoever spiked Luisa's drink?

24:09.689 --> 24:11.068
I'd like to take
a look at those.

24:14.862 --> 24:16.034
I hope there's
no hard feelings-

24:16.034 --> 24:17.034
about yesterday.

24:17.034 --> 24:18.413
I know how
some men are-

24:18.413 --> 24:20.689
about being bested
by a woman.

24:20.689 --> 24:22.310
Well anything in the name
of learning new skills.

24:23.862 --> 24:24.862
Day two!

24:25.172 --> 24:27.448
Remember, get on
that wavelength.

24:27.448 --> 24:28.758
Heed what your
target is saying.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.068
And influence
them to change.

24:33.413 --> 24:36.000
What can I do to resolve
this situation for you?

24:36.793 --> 24:37.586
You know.

24:37.586 --> 24:39.034
Taking yourself
out of contention-

24:39.034 --> 24:40.896
when Chief Archer retires
would be a good start.

24:42.206 --> 24:43.034
What?

24:43.034 --> 24:45.241
I mean I'm just
drawing from real-life-

24:45.241 --> 24:46.310
like you did yesterday.

24:47.517 --> 24:48.344
Okay.

24:49.068 --> 24:51.034
I'm on your wavelength.

24:51.034 --> 24:52.413
And I heed what
you're saying.

24:52.413 --> 24:53.310
So you'll
decline the offer-

24:54.241 --> 24:55.724
if the board approaches
you about the job?

24:56.068 --> 24:56.689
If?

24:56.689 --> 24:57.551
Mmmm.

24:58.586 --> 24:59.517
How about this?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.551
If I can't de-
escalate you-

25:02.413 --> 25:03.103
then I'll consider it.

25:03.758 --> 25:04.689
Okay.

25:04.689 --> 25:06.068
It's not going
to happen.

25:06.068 --> 25:08.965
But what if you do
manage to de-escalate?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.241
Then you pull yourself
out of consideration-

25:11.241 --> 25:11.965
if Chief Archer retires.

25:13.344 --> 25:14.310
Oooh.

25:15.137 --> 25:16.275
You've got
yourself a deal!

25:20.551 --> 25:23.241
Looks like we've got our
first successful de-escalation!

25:23.241 --> 25:24.034
Say what?

25:24.034 --> 25:24.758
No no.

25:24.758 --> 25:25.586
That wasn't any-

25:25.586 --> 25:26.275
Come on.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.172
Tell him, Joe.

25:27.793 --> 25:28.620
Tell me what?

25:29.482 --> 25:31.620
Oh, just that
the Which Way-

25:31.620 --> 25:33.551
is a great way for
mediating conflict.

25:43.931 --> 25:45.172
So when
Luisa texts Taylor-

25:45.172 --> 25:47.655
she's heading back
to the hotel at 1:05am.

25:47.655 --> 25:48.827
And time of death
is around three-

25:48.827 --> 25:49.965
leaving two hours
unaccounted for.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.965
And given the GHB-

25:52.965 --> 25:54.517
who knows what could've
happened in that time?

25:54.517 --> 25:56.793
I've asked Karma to look
for signs of sexual assault.

25:56.793 --> 25:58.103
So Luisa-

25:58.103 --> 25:59.482
she leaves the bar.

25:59.482 --> 26:00.551
She's not feeling well.

26:00.551 --> 26:02.517
Does the person who
spiked her drink follow her?

26:02.517 --> 26:03.827
They could
have left together.

26:03.827 --> 26:04.931
Yeah, I mean-

26:04.931 --> 26:06.827
pretty risky move for
a potential killer.

26:08.241 --> 26:10.448
Luisa had a relatively low
level of GHB in her system.

26:10.448 --> 26:13.137
Maybe she invited them back
and had a change of heart?

26:13.137 --> 26:14.034
Well a change
of heart-

26:14.034 --> 26:15.379
would explain the
agitated behaviour-

26:15.379 --> 26:16.793
on CCTV.

26:16.793 --> 26:18.103
Luisa said no.

26:18.103 --> 26:19.000
Her attacker pushed back.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.068
We
need to find out-

26:20.068 --> 26:21.034
whoever this was.

26:21.034 --> 26:22.724
I've got Luisa with
a guy at the bar.

26:23.517 --> 26:24.413
Drew Pang.

26:24.413 --> 26:27.241
Arrested for
a DUI in 2018.

26:27.241 --> 26:29.241
And interviewed on suspicion
of sexual assault last year.

26:29.241 --> 26:30.137
I need an address.

26:30.137 --> 26:30.793
On it.

26:30.793 --> 26:31.482
Rex.

26:42.172 --> 26:43.000

You scared me!

26:56.551 --> 26:58.068
Detective Hudson, SJPD.

26:58.068 --> 26:59.827
I need to ask you a
couple of questions.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.448
You were at Wyld
on Friday night?

27:03.413 --> 27:04.482
I stopped by.

27:04.758 --> 27:06.517
Well I'm investigating
the death of a woman-

27:06.517 --> 27:07.655
after she left
the club.

27:09.206 --> 27:10.000
That's heavy.

27:11.620 --> 27:12.482
But I can't
help you.

27:12.482 --> 27:13.172
I didn't see anything.

27:13.172 --> 27:14.034
Are you sure
about that?

27:15.965 --> 27:16.827
That chick died?

27:17.689 --> 27:20.103
That chick's name
was Luisa Hastings.

27:20.689 --> 27:22.758
And we think she was
slipped a date rape drug-

27:22.758 --> 27:23.586
before she did.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.241
A date rape- ?

27:26.344 --> 27:26.965
Man.

27:26.965 --> 27:28.724
That's brutal.

27:29.758 --> 27:30.896
Yeah, it is.

27:30.896 --> 27:32.137
Wait, what's he doing?

27:32.137 --> 27:33.172
Working.

27:33.172 --> 27:33.862
Look.

27:34.172 --> 27:35.482
You can't just search-

27:35.482 --> 27:36.862
I didn't do
anything man!

27:36.862 --> 27:38.448
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

27:40.965 --> 27:42.172
I think you're
the kind of guy-

27:42.172 --> 27:44.344
who keeps GHB in
their glove box, Drew.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.758
I didn't kill
that chick.

27:49.931 --> 27:50.586
Luisa.

27:51.758 --> 27:53.275
Even if I did slip
her something-

27:54.517 --> 27:57.000
which I'm not
saying that I did-

27:59.034 --> 28:00.344
she barely
touched her soda.

28:01.206 --> 28:03.241
She was too busy taking
care of her drunk friends.

28:03.241 --> 28:04.482
Well she texted one
of those friends-

28:04.482 --> 28:05.482
to say she wasn't
feeling well.

28:05.482 --> 28:06.344
Yeah.

28:06.344 --> 28:08.103
But that had nothing
to do with GHB.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.862
She wanted to
get out of there.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.000
She needed an excuse.

28:14.034 --> 28:14.758
Why's that?

28:16.862 --> 28:19.413
Some other chick
from the bridal party-

28:19.413 --> 28:21.862
was giving her a hard time
about money or something.

28:21.965 --> 28:23.862
So we went
for a walk.

28:23.862 --> 28:24.517
A walk?

28:24.517 --> 28:26.034
Really?

28:26.034 --> 28:26.931
Believe what
you want, man.

28:31.586 --> 28:32.448
Okay.

28:33.275 --> 28:34.310
Did I want
to hook up?

28:34.724 --> 28:35.517
Yeah.

28:35.517 --> 28:36.206
Sure.

28:36.310 --> 28:37.379
But-

28:37.379 --> 28:38.517
she wasn't in the
right headspace.

28:38.655 --> 28:41.206
So I walked her
to her hotel.

28:41.965 --> 28:43.241
And then I
said goodnight.

28:43.413 --> 28:44.724
Like a gentleman.

29:02.172 --> 29:03.344
She was
preyed upon-

29:03.344 --> 29:05.000
in the last moments
of her life.

29:06.241 --> 29:07.344
Does that make
Drew our killer?

29:08.310 --> 29:09.724
I don't believe so.

29:09.724 --> 29:11.448
Whoever killed
Luisa knew her-

29:11.448 --> 29:13.931
and her history
of addiction.

29:13.931 --> 29:15.482
What kind of findings
could tell you that?

29:17.103 --> 29:19.413
I noticed that her lower
lip was slightly swollen.

29:19.413 --> 29:20.689
So I had a
closer look-

29:20.689 --> 29:23.137
and took some photos
inside her mouth.

29:24.724 --> 29:25.931
Here, let
me show you.

29:30.896 --> 29:31.931
Bite marks.

29:31.931 --> 29:32.896
They're not obvious.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.482
But if you look way
back in her mouth-

29:34.482 --> 29:37.758
you can see where she's bitten
the insides of her cheeks.

29:37.758 --> 29:39.482
Pretty severe.

29:41.551 --> 29:43.000
Sustained in
a struggle?

29:43.103 --> 29:44.620
Yeah, I believe so.

29:44.620 --> 29:45.724
How do bite
marks tell you-

29:45.724 --> 29:47.689
that Luisa's killer knew
about her addiction issues?

29:48.275 --> 29:48.931
Have a look.

29:55.827 --> 29:56.862
What am I
looking at here?

29:56.862 --> 29:58.379
Granulated codeine.

30:00.379 --> 30:01.241
It was ground-

30:01.241 --> 30:02.241
into her lower bicusbid.

30:03.310 --> 30:05.206
So someone
force-fed her?

30:05.206 --> 30:06.862
It must've been
just antemortem-

30:06.862 --> 30:08.827
for none of it to
reach her bloodstream.

30:08.827 --> 30:10.310
Hmm.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.758
Well from the look
of these bite marks-

30:11.758 --> 30:12.758
Luisa must have
fought back-

30:12.758 --> 30:13.655
with everything she had.

30:13.655 --> 30:15.448
Even possibly
biting her attacker.

30:15.448 --> 30:18.034
Someone tried to push
her off the wagon.

30:18.034 --> 30:19.793
And when it didn't work,
they had to make sure-

30:19.793 --> 30:21.827
that she couldn't reveal
what they tried to do.

30:21.827 --> 30:22.482
Mmm.

30:22.482 --> 30:23.551
That's it.

30:25.310 --> 30:26.275
But who was it?

30:27.241 --> 30:28.172
And why?

30:39.482 --> 30:40.517
Guys.

30:40.517 --> 30:41.931
So Drew's story
checks out.

30:41.931 --> 30:44.344
I can conclusively say
he is not our killer.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.310
Yeah, we figured.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.896
But we're going to hang
on to him anyway.

30:46.896 --> 30:48.862
We have him for possession
of a controlled substance-

30:48.862 --> 30:49.896
at the very least.

30:49.896 --> 30:50.965
Wait, I feel like I'm
missing something here.

30:50.965 --> 30:52.551
How do you figure
that Drew didn't do it?

30:52.551 --> 30:53.931
Autopsy showed
that Luisa's killer-

30:53.931 --> 30:55.758
knew about her history
of opiate addiction.

30:55.758 --> 30:58.275
She doesn't have any ties
to St. John's that I've found.

30:59.137 --> 31:00.103
Which means
that the killer-

31:00.103 --> 31:02.000
is probably a member
of the wedding party.

31:03.103 --> 31:05.206
They're all medical
professionals, right?

31:05.206 --> 31:05.862
Yeah.

31:05.862 --> 31:07.103
That'd mean-

31:07.103 --> 31:09.172
they would have had easy access
to something like codeine.

31:09.172 --> 31:10.413
Wait a minute.

31:10.413 --> 31:12.448
Okay so I know Luisa's friends
doubted she's gotten clean.

31:12.448 --> 31:14.517
But why would one of
them want to kill her?

31:14.517 --> 31:15.793
Well by the
sounds of it-

31:15.793 --> 31:17.689
the wedding party
weren't really her friends.

31:17.689 --> 31:20.137
And there was one
bridesmaid in particular-

31:20.137 --> 31:21.896
who had a problem
with her.

31:21.896 --> 31:23.586
Of course I
didn't kill Luisa.

31:23.586 --> 31:24.724
Why would I bother-

31:24.724 --> 31:27.103
when she was bound to do
it herself sooner or later?

31:27.103 --> 31:28.206
Tell us what
you really think.

31:28.965 --> 31:30.103
Well I'm sorry.

31:30.103 --> 31:31.034
But you didn't
know her.

31:31.034 --> 31:31.724
She was a mess.

31:31.724 --> 31:32.896
It wasn't going
to end well.

31:33.793 --> 31:35.862
I understand that perspective.

31:35.862 --> 31:37.517
I really do.

31:37.517 --> 31:39.620
But all the evidence-

31:39.620 --> 31:41.068
points to Luisa being
committed to her sobriety.

31:42.482 --> 31:43.448
Well no offense.

31:43.448 --> 31:44.517
But I've heard
that one before.

31:45.931 --> 31:47.275
Your real problem
with Luisa though-

31:47.275 --> 31:49.206
it went beyond her
addiction problems.

31:49.206 --> 31:51.034
Didn't it, Quincy?

31:51.034 --> 31:52.241
What do you mean?

31:52.241 --> 31:54.275
You were jealous of her
relationship with Taylor.

31:54.965 --> 31:56.517
Oh please.

31:56.517 --> 31:57.793
You told me yourself.

31:57.793 --> 31:58.758
You encouraged Taylor-

31:58.758 --> 32:01.000
to drop her
burn-out friend.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.758
Yeah, but that's not-

32:02.758 --> 32:03.620
Are you sure-

32:03.620 --> 32:04.517
you didn't help
the situation along-

32:04.517 --> 32:05.793
by fabricating a relapse?

32:05.793 --> 32:06.793
Fabricating?

32:06.793 --> 32:07.482
Look.

32:07.482 --> 32:08.413
I've already told you.

32:08.413 --> 32:09.689
I basically blacked out-

32:09.689 --> 32:11.310
after I helped her
pay for her bar tab.

32:11.310 --> 32:12.413
Convenient.

32:12.655 --> 32:14.034
No, I swear.

32:14.034 --> 32:17.482
I don't remember anything after
she helped me off the stage.

32:17.482 --> 32:19.724
And then like made
me drink her soda.

32:23.517 --> 32:25.379
You caught that too?

32:25.379 --> 32:27.068
Drew told you Luisa hardly
touched her drink, right?

32:27.068 --> 32:27.758
Yeah.

32:27.758 --> 32:29.000
Said she was
too preoccupied-

32:29.000 --> 32:30.344
taking care of
her drunk friends.

32:30.344 --> 32:34.034
Maybe Luisa passed the drugged
soda off to Quincy by mistake.

32:34.034 --> 32:35.689
It would explain
the blackout.

32:35.689 --> 32:37.000
Yeah, if she
did black out.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.620
I still want to
confirm that story.

32:39.344 --> 32:40.034
If she consents-

32:40.034 --> 32:40.896
I can run
some tests.

32:40.896 --> 32:42.103
And we can find
out for sure.

32:42.103 --> 32:43.172
Okay.

32:43.172 --> 32:44.517
In the meantime, I'm
going to head to the hotel-

32:44.517 --> 32:46.413
to see if the other bridesmaid
can corroborate any of this.

32:47.724 --> 32:48.379
Bye.

32:50.448 --> 32:51.689
Okay!

32:51.689 --> 32:55.689
Let's move on to practicing
techniques to establish control.

32:56.137 --> 32:57.275
When you're being attacked-

32:57.275 --> 32:59.931
Your goal is to get
your target restrained.

32:59.931 --> 33:02.413
But no one should
get hurt, okay?

33:02.413 --> 33:04.482
I hope you don't think I'm
going to let you best me-

33:04.482 --> 33:05.862
after that trick you
just pulled earlier.

33:05.862 --> 33:06.724
Trick?

33:06.724 --> 33:07.482
Mm-hmm.

33:07.482 --> 33:08.379
You shook my hand.

33:08.379 --> 33:09.034
That's on you.

33:09.034 --> 33:10.241
Well-

33:10.241 --> 33:11.965
I hope you don't think I'm
taking myself out of the race-

33:11.965 --> 33:13.310
to replace Chief
Archer after that.

33:13.310 --> 33:14.172
I wouldn't
dream of it.

33:14.689 --> 33:15.724
Where's the fun
in that huh?

33:15.724 --> 33:16.482
Ohh!

33:16.482 --> 33:17.379
Okay?

33:18.241 --> 33:18.931
Yeah.

33:18.931 --> 33:19.689
It's just like this.

33:20.379 --> 33:21.068
Ooh!

33:21.068 --> 33:21.827
What's going on?

33:21.827 --> 33:23.103
Okay Lewis.

33:23.103 --> 33:23.827
I see you.

33:23.827 --> 33:24.517
That's what
you're bringing?

33:24.517 --> 33:25.241
Want a little more?

33:31.517 --> 33:32.172
What you think?

33:32.172 --> 33:33.655
I was born yesterday?

33:33.655 --> 33:34.586
I'm new?

33:34.586 --> 33:35.241
I'm not new.

33:35.241 --> 33:35.931
Come on!

33:35.931 --> 33:36.827
Right here.
- South paw?

33:36.827 --> 33:37.517
What else you got?

33:37.517 --> 33:38.448
Oh what I got?

33:38.448 --> 33:39.310
Yeah, show me, show me.

33:39.310 --> 33:40.172
Oooh!

33:40.172 --> 33:40.827
Ohh!

33:40.827 --> 33:41.620
Too slow Lewis!

33:41.620 --> 33:42.655
Got to be
quicker that that!

33:42.655 --> 33:43.586
So you anticipated
that huh?

33:44.310 --> 33:45.137
You expected
that didn't you?

33:45.517 --> 33:46.172
Ohhh!

33:46.172 --> 33:47.068
Ooh, what was that?

33:47.068 --> 33:47.793
Come on, do it!

33:47.793 --> 33:48.827
Oh that was
definitely new!

33:49.551 --> 33:50.655
You got to use-

33:50.655 --> 33:52.034
that little brain cell you
got in there still huh?

33:52.034 --> 33:52.724
Watch this.

33:55.206 --> 33:56.172
See?

33:56.172 --> 33:57.965
That's how we do
it in Major Crimes.

34:14.551 --> 34:15.724
How intoxicated
would you say-

34:15.724 --> 34:17.448
Quincy was the
other night?

34:17.448 --> 34:18.896
She was
pretty lit up.

34:18.896 --> 34:21.275
I basically had to carry
her back to the hotel.

34:21.275 --> 34:23.344
Did you take her straight
back to her room?

34:23.344 --> 34:25.724
No, we um- uh-

34:25.724 --> 34:27.551
I think maybe
Taylor did?

34:27.551 --> 34:28.827
It's all kind
of a blur.

34:30.793 --> 34:32.482
Why are you asking
about Quincy?

34:32.482 --> 34:34.482
We're still trying to piece
together exactly what happened.

34:36.586 --> 34:37.551
Excuse me a moment.

34:39.172 --> 34:40.137
Hey.

34:40.137 --> 34:41.586
You get the lab
results back?

34:41.586 --> 34:43.620
Quincy's GHB was
through the roof.

34:43.620 --> 34:45.620
So she did drink
the spiked soda.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.379
Yeah and based on how
high her levels were-

34:47.379 --> 34:49.137
I don't think she could've
formed a sentence-

34:49.137 --> 34:50.413
much less kill someone.

34:52.068 --> 34:53.000
I've got to go.

34:56.965 --> 34:57.586
Hannah stop!

34:59.448 --> 35:00.344
We're not done yet!

35:22.448 --> 35:23.482
Rashid,
we have to-

35:28.068 --> 35:28.965
What was that
all about?

35:29.896 --> 35:30.586
Oh my gosh.

35:30.586 --> 35:31.517
This must
look so bad.

35:31.517 --> 35:32.517
But it's not
what you think.

35:32.517 --> 35:33.206
Really?

35:33.206 --> 35:34.137
Because it looked like-

35:34.137 --> 35:35.482
you just fled from
an officer of the law.

35:35.482 --> 35:36.206
It's not her fault.

35:36.965 --> 35:37.620
Okay.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.068
Now I really want to
know what's going on.

35:40.068 --> 35:42.448
We didn't have anything
to do with Luisa's death.

35:42.448 --> 35:43.482
Prove it.

35:45.931 --> 35:46.793
This is
where you talk.

35:46.793 --> 35:47.482
Come on.

35:48.724 --> 35:49.896
We can alibi
each other.

35:50.000 --> 35:50.620
Hmm?

35:50.620 --> 35:51.724
We
got a little-

35:51.724 --> 35:54.000
too cozy on the hotel
patio the night she died.

35:54.103 --> 35:55.241
It was a stupid-

35:55.241 --> 35:56.551
stupid drunken mistake.

35:57.137 --> 35:58.344
We both went
out for a smoke-

35:58.344 --> 35:59.827
after everyone else
had gone to bed.

35:59.827 --> 36:02.344
And one thing just
led to another.

36:02.344 --> 36:03.068
Okay.

36:03.068 --> 36:04.241
Why did you just
run right now?

36:04.241 --> 36:05.482
You were asking
about what happened-

36:05.482 --> 36:06.689
when we got back
from the bar.

36:06.689 --> 36:08.482
Rashid and I hadn't
gotten our stories straight.

36:08.482 --> 36:09.172
And I panicked.

36:09.827 --> 36:10.931
Can either of
you prove this?

36:10.931 --> 36:11.965
I don't know how.

36:11.965 --> 36:13.620
It was just
the two of us.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.758
I might have something.

36:15.206 --> 36:16.310
You said you
deleted them!

36:16.310 --> 36:17.931
I put them in a
private folder.

36:17.931 --> 36:19.172
No one's
going to see it.

36:19.172 --> 36:20.068
Hannah, if
Taylor sees them-

36:21.482 --> 36:22.793
Give me the proof.

36:26.551 --> 36:27.344
Bunny ears?

36:28.275 --> 36:29.551
We were drunk.

36:31.137 --> 36:32.000
One photo-

36:32.000 --> 36:33.758
taken twenty minutes
before Luisa died.

36:33.758 --> 36:34.448
That doesn't exactly-

36:34.448 --> 36:35.379
alibi you out.

36:35.379 --> 36:36.482
There are more.

36:36.482 --> 36:38.275
You can scroll.

36:48.344 --> 36:50.413
You're free to go.

36:50.413 --> 36:52.724
Send me those
photos first.

36:52.724 --> 36:57.241
Sure, I'll airdrop
them to you now.

37:00.310 --> 37:02.689
You're not going to share those
photos with Taylor, are you?

37:02.689 --> 37:03.793
Not unless
I have to.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.413
But maybe you should.

37:06.413 --> 37:07.655
You really want to start
your marriage off-

37:07.655 --> 37:08.793
with a lie?

37:10.034 --> 37:10.931
Go on.

37:16.137 --> 37:17.586
Looks like we're back
to square one, pal.

37:19.931 --> 37:20.793
Wait a second.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.931
Hello?

37:28.931 --> 37:30.241
Jesse, I'm going to
send you some photos.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.655
Okay, looking now.

37:35.379 --> 37:36.689
What's with
the bunny ears?

37:36.689 --> 37:38.793
Just- the bunny ears
aren't the point.

37:38.793 --> 37:39.931
Look in the
deep background.

37:39.931 --> 37:41.241
Does that look
like Luisa to you?

37:41.241 --> 37:42.310
Uhh-

37:44.620 --> 37:46.068
Yeah, I
think it is.

37:46.068 --> 37:47.689
Who's she arguing with?

37:47.689 --> 37:48.965
His back is
to the camera.

37:48.965 --> 37:53.344
Let me see if there's any nearby
CCTV that I can hack into.

37:53.344 --> 37:54.034
Oh yeah.

37:54.034 --> 37:55.034
Bingo!

37:55.034 --> 37:56.517
Okay, there's an ATM
across the road.

37:56.517 --> 37:57.448
Just give me
a second.

38:13.344 --> 38:14.034
It's Nate.

38:15.448 --> 38:16.241
Rashid's best man?

38:16.241 --> 38:17.517
Why would she be
arguing with him?

38:17.517 --> 38:18.482
I don't know.

38:18.482 --> 38:20.103
Let me scroll back
and see what I can find.

38:22.344 --> 38:23.172
Okay Charlie.

38:23.172 --> 38:24.206
I've got Nate
with a guy.

38:25.034 --> 38:26.724
Something's changing hands.

38:34.172 --> 38:35.586
I think Nate
was dealing.

38:38.379 --> 38:40.068
Luisa must have seen.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.551
Her odd behaviour
on the lobby CCTV-

38:42.551 --> 38:43.448
that wasn't
her on drugs.

38:43.448 --> 38:45.034
That was her reacting
to finding out-

38:45.034 --> 38:46.103
that Nate was
selling them.

38:46.103 --> 38:48.344
So she goes outside-

38:48.344 --> 38:49.172
confronts Nate-

38:49.172 --> 38:51.241
maybe threatens
to tell the others?

38:51.241 --> 38:53.896
Okay but how does that lead to
her falling from the mezzanine?

38:53.896 --> 38:57.655
He must have followed her inside
and cornered her up there.

38:57.655 --> 39:00.275
Planned to discredit anything
she told Taylor by-

39:00.275 --> 39:01.344
force-feeding her codeine.

39:01.344 --> 39:02.655
But she spit
the codeine out.

39:02.655 --> 39:03.344
And maybe-

39:03.344 --> 39:04.689
bit him in
the process.

39:06.241 --> 39:07.482
Then he pushed her.

39:09.103 --> 39:10.103
I'm bringing him in.

39:12.931 --> 39:13.655
I'm so sorry.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.551
We've got this.

39:16.724 --> 39:17.724
Taylor [crying]: Quincy!

39:19.000 --> 39:19.793
Come on, hey.

39:19.793 --> 39:20.448
Okay.

39:20.448 --> 39:21.137
It's okay.

39:21.517 --> 39:22.551
Ah, hey boy.

39:23.206 --> 39:24.310
Nate.

39:24.965 --> 39:25.655
I need you-

39:25.655 --> 39:26.655
to come down
to the station-

39:26.655 --> 39:27.517
to answer a
few questions.

39:27.517 --> 39:29.172
Sorry, but we're
headed home.

39:29.172 --> 39:30.931
I've got an overnight
in the ER tonight.

39:30.931 --> 39:33.137
You're going to need
somebody to fill in for you.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.551
What kind of questions-

39:34.551 --> 39:35.379
are we talking about?

39:38.655 --> 39:40.068
Well for starters-

39:40.068 --> 39:41.344
where did you get
those bite marks-

39:41.344 --> 39:42.620
on your hand?

39:42.620 --> 39:43.620
Then maybe we
can talk about-

39:43.620 --> 39:45.068
trafficking narcotics?

39:45.068 --> 39:45.758
And murder?

39:48.827 --> 39:49.482
Rex.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.137
Go.

40:12.206 --> 40:13.620
Ughh!

40:17.068 --> 40:18.482
I don't think
you're going to be-

40:18.482 --> 40:20.620
practicing medicine

And Drew?

Being charged with possession.

41:56.827 --> 41:58.241

assault charge too-

Hi!
