01:20.266 --> 01:23.133
’decided to join together
in holy macaroni!’

01:23.166 --> 01:25.133
‐Congratulations!
‐Yeah.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.733
It’s, it’s official. Mary Anne
and I are getting marri‐yed.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.433
[laughing]

01:34.466 --> 01:36.666
Oh, Mary Anne!
I’m so happy for you!

01:36.700 --> 01:38.433
I’m so happy for me, too!

01:38.466 --> 01:41.100
Well, let’s take a load off.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.100
Yeah...I gotta tell ya.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.366
It‐it was a humongous mistake
breaking up.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.600
Mary Anne is‐is‐is
everything that‐that

01:47.633 --> 01:49.800
I’ve been looking for
my whole life.

01:49.833 --> 01:53.233
Well, that is great! Now, we’re
gonna have a lot to do, Jen.

01:53.266 --> 01:56.633
I’m thinking...July wedding?
How’s that hit everybody?

01:56.666 --> 01:59.033
It’ll be a lot of pressure,
but I think we can do it, Larry.

01:59.066 --> 02:00.400
We’re getting marri‐yed
tomorrow.

02:01.533 --> 02:03.066
‐Tomorrow?
‐Tomorrow?

02:03.100 --> 02:05.033
You can’t get married tomorrow!

02:05.066 --> 02:07.166
Cousin, you don’t understand.
Tell them, pumpkin.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.400
There’s a sacred Myposian
tradition that says

02:09.433 --> 02:11.333
"Once a couple announces
their engagement

02:11.366 --> 02:13.733
they must get married
within 24 hours."

02:13.766 --> 02:16.400
And what happens to you if you
wait any longer than that?

02:16.433 --> 02:18.033
All of your children
are born with hooves.

02:18.066 --> 02:19.233
That’s right.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.566
Nothing is simple
with you Mypiots, is it?

02:25.233 --> 02:27.766
If you’re getting married
tomorrow, we have a lot to do!

02:27.800 --> 02:30.166
Well, yeah, if we’re gonna have
a Myposian wedding...

02:30.200 --> 02:33.400
uh‐uh, don’t we, don’t we need,
uh, jugglers? Livestock?

02:33.433 --> 02:36.366
A‐a wedding hat of some kind?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.566
Well, cousin,
we’ll have all that

02:37.600 --> 02:41.533
when we go to Mypos
for our...honeymoon.

02:41.566 --> 02:45.300
But, uh, for this ceremony, all
I need is a shine on my shoes

02:45.333 --> 02:47.133
and my
Bitatatoutata Ratatatouille.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.166
A Bitatatoutata Ratatatouille?

02:53.500 --> 02:56.400
Yeah, the Myposian
marri‐yage necklace.

02:56.433 --> 03:00.333
‐Myposian marriage necklace?
‐Tell them, pumpkin.

03:00.366 --> 03:03.733
It’s been a part of the Myposian
marriage ceremony for centuries.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.100
And what happens to your
marri‐yage if you don’t have it?

03:06.133 --> 03:09.033
‐Your marriage is doomed.
‐That’s right.

03:09.066 --> 03:10.766
W‐well, that’s very nice,
but there is no way

03:10.800 --> 03:12.700
we’re gonna get
a Myposian marriage necklace

03:12.733 --> 03:14.466
all the way from Mypos
by tomorrow.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.433
Cousin, you don’t understand!
Tell them, pumpkin.

03:17.466 --> 03:19.800
When a Myposian boy comes of age
he’s given the necklace.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.600
The Bitatatoutata Ratatatouille.

03:21.633 --> 03:23.366
What he said.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.633
Whenever the moment is right

03:24.666 --> 03:26.600
he wants to be prepared,
so he carries

03:26.633 --> 03:28.100
the necklace with him
wherever he goes.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.533
Except, of course when he’s...

03:29.566 --> 03:30.600
‐In the shower.
‐In the shower.

03:30.633 --> 03:31.666
[laughing]

03:34.533 --> 03:37.333
You know, if‐if we are going
to have a wedding tomorrow

03:37.366 --> 03:38.700
we are all gonna have to help.

03:38.733 --> 03:41.466
Alright, now,
I’m gonna need pencil, paper

03:41.500 --> 03:45.366
and a phone book. Okay.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.633
Well, I need a dress
and some flowers.

03:47.666 --> 03:49.733
Dress and some flowers, okay.
Let’s see, let’s see.

03:49.766 --> 03:51.600
Oh, I know
a great dress shop downtown

03:51.633 --> 03:52.666
and my friend Barbara
is a florist.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.566
I can take care of all that.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.033
Okay, what else?

03:56.066 --> 03:58.033
Well, uh,
we need someone to marry us.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.166
Somebody to marry you! Okay.
Let’s see, let’s see.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.333
Oh, my father knows a minister.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.800
I’m sure
he could marry you tomorrow!

04:02.833 --> 04:04.200
‐Ooh!
‐Yeah.

04:04.233 --> 04:06.100
Okay, Jen,
you take care of that, too.

04:06.133 --> 04:09.200
And we need a church,
a reception hall and a band.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.166
Okay, let’s see!
Let’s see.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.633
We can use Chapel by the Shore,
the Beekman Hotel.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.333
And Barbara’s husband
is a rock promoter.

04:15.366 --> 04:16.600
He can get a great band!

04:16.632 --> 04:19.533
‐Oh.
‐We have a lot to do.

04:19.565 --> 04:20.600
Come on, Mary Anne,
let’s go upstairs

04:20.632 --> 04:21.766
and start making some calls.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.700
Okay.

04:23.733 --> 04:25.033
[giggles]

04:30.566 --> 04:31.566
[gasps]
Ooh!

04:34.600 --> 04:38.800
[sighs]
Well, I‐I guess I’d better get
off and get my shoes shined.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.400
Uh, which shoes
do you think I should wear?

04:40.433 --> 04:41.733
‐Oh, well‐‐
‐Well, uh, you’re right!

04:41.766 --> 04:44.533
I’ll just shine them all!

04:44.566 --> 04:47.600
Oh, cousin, cousin, you want to
come? You want to come with me?

04:47.633 --> 04:49.700
No, you‐you just, uh...
You go along.

04:49.733 --> 04:52.333
I’m sure
you’re‐you’re much too busy

04:52.366 --> 04:55.533
to drag along somebody
who’s got, uh...nothing to do.

04:57.066 --> 05:00.233
‐Okay.
‐Well, you know, hey!

05:00.266 --> 05:03.533
Hey! It’s‐it’s not
the first time, you know.

05:03.566 --> 05:06.366
I‐I remember that, uh,
Christmas when I was, uh...

05:06.400 --> 05:10.800
seven, and, uh, uh, nobody in my
family remembered to wake me up.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.133
[chuckles]

05:16.066 --> 05:18.033
Yeah, you know, but don’t worry.
Don’t worry.

05:18.066 --> 05:20.633
[chuckling]
I’ll just be on the sidelines

05:20.666 --> 05:24.066
on the most important day
of your life.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.266
Yeah, it’s okay.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.700
You know, I’m not the kind of
guy who’s easily hurt.

05:28.833 --> 05:30.300
I’m tough.

05:31.466 --> 05:33.200

for you to do all along.

asked you earlier.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.700
Cousin, will you be
my piggliwiggliki?

06:16.100 --> 06:18.200
What is a piggliwiggliki?

06:18.233 --> 06:21.200
Well, it’s similar to what
Americans call a best man.

to be your piggliwiggliki!

is walk the groom up the aisle.

No, that‐that’s all he does
at the ceremony.

06:55.700 --> 07:00.233
But before the ceremony, he has
a very important role to play.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.233
Which is?

Guardian of the Myposian

Guardian of the marriage
necklace? I can do that!

Alright, goody, goody,
we’ll go with that.

before I glued them down.

Cousin...this is
the Bitatatoutata Ratatatouille.

It is placed around both
the bride and the groom

07:43.500 --> 07:46.633
at the ceremony
before they exchange their vows.

07:46.666 --> 07:51.433
It symbolizes their,
their unity...their oneness.

And that is why

08:00.766 --> 08:03.233
from the moment
his marri‐yage is announced

08:03.266 --> 08:05.433

out of his sight!

necklace meant to you

‐No. No!

Alright! Now I remember!

12:38.666 --> 12:40.400
I had the necklace
when I was here.

12:40.433 --> 12:41.466
And then I went
into the kitchen

12:41.500 --> 12:42.766
I grabbed an orange.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.733
I came back in here,
I peeled the orange

12:44.766 --> 12:46.400
and I was on my way
back into the kitchen

12:46.433 --> 12:49.266
to throw away the orange peels
when I saw that pot!

12:52.066 --> 12:53.433
So I threw the orange peels away

12:53.466 --> 12:55.200

12:59.433 --> 13:01.100
But don’t worry!

Because we can get the necklace
out of the trash!

Would that be the same trash
they picked up today?

Yes, that would be the same
trash, but‐don’t‐no‐no...

because the dump

It’s not your fault.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.100
Well, you had to,
it’s the piggliwiggliki’s job.

No, it isn’t.

14:01.066 --> 14:03.366
What do you mean,
"No, it isn’t?"

14:03.400 --> 14:06.166
You, you said it was
the piggliwiggliki’s job

14:06.200 --> 14:09.033
to‐to be the guardian of
the Myposian marriage necklace.

14:09.066 --> 14:12.400

14:29.733 --> 14:31.566
You wanted so badly
to have something to do.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.566
So I invented the fact
that the piggliwiggliki

14:34.600 --> 14:36.200
gets to be the guardian
of the necklace.
