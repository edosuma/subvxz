00:12.679 --> 00:15.516
<i>The Metropolitan Police
are yet to comment on the incident,</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:17.809
<i>but details are starting to emerge.</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:21.730
<i>The body was reportedly thrown
from a vehicle outside Anna Livia's,</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:25.025
<i>a restaurant frequented
by stars and politicians.</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:26.360
<i>Home Secretary Peter J--</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:29.530
Sit down.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.659
I won't be here long, so I'll stand.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.370
I know what you're going to say.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.038
Then why don't you say it for me?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.624
That I've bitten off more than I can chew.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.460
That I'm meddling with things
that don't concern me.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.088
That I'm dangerously out of my depth.
Close?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.173
Bang on.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.344
You set a team on MI5
to test our security defenses.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.805
- And now that team has gone rogue.
- Well, more than rogue.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.641
They dumped a fucking body
outside my favorite restaurant.

00:57.641 --> 01:00.227
It's gonna have a seriously detrimental
effect on the restaurant bookings.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.896
- That's really what you want to focus on?
- I know the owner.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.149
And I'm also one of the investors.
But that's not the point.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.235
- No, it isn't.
- Point is, this can't get out.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.403
I'd have to resign.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.156
And it would completely undermine
Chieftain's viability as a business.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.951
In which you also have a financial stake.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.412
You understand my predicament.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.085
I'd love to let you drown
in your own swill.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.589
But you have tarnished MI5
with this nonsense.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.342
So I will clean it up and make it go away.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.386
How? We can't give in to them.

01:35.512 --> 01:39.099
Leave it to me, the professional.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.522
Ingrid.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.817
I'm going to let the tiger team
into the facility to see the Grey Books.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.613
Really? You don't have to do that.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.865
<i>You could stall them, track them down.</i>

01:55.365 --> 01:58.827
This way, the Home Secretary's tiger team
genuinely breach a secure MI5 location

01:58.827 --> 02:00.829
in a way that's harmful to him
but not to us.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.290
<i>There's nothing of any value
in the facility.</i>

02:03.290 --> 02:07.794
No, but I am in charge of the facility.
Is this gonna come back at me?

02:08.336 --> 02:10.506
Of course not, Diana. You have my word.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.069
Cartwright?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.487
Upstairs.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.573
I found out where
Donovan's keeping Standish.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.866
No, you didn't.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.034
Not exactly,

02:39.034 --> 02:42.204
but I've got a list of properties
on Chieftain's books.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.914
I've narrowed it down to these four.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.208
Time frame means
she's within 30 miles of London.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.087
But Donovan won't be using
any Chieftain properties.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.296
Because?

02:51.296 --> 02:54.216
Because then they'd know
where he is, dipshit.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.387
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

02:58.387 --> 03:01.139
Show me that picture you got
of Standish with a gun to her head.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.977
Right.
There's been a bit of a development.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.895
Spider works for Chieftain.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.522
- Thank you.
- No problem.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.692
Yeah, well,
they're not gonna let Standish go,

03:11.692 --> 03:13.277
so I'm gonna have to get her myself.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.488
Here. Put that on your laptop.
Blow it up. Make it bigger.

03:16.989 --> 03:17.990
So think.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.828
Was there any
background noise when they rang?

03:23.829 --> 03:24.830
No. Nothing.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.710
- But did you hear what she just said?
- Spider was in on it, the tiger team.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.461
Yeah. What was the message?

03:31.461 --> 03:34.756
The message was, you know,
"Don't tell anyone.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.259
Be at the Barbican Bridge
or Catherine Standish dies."

03:37.259 --> 03:39.553
- And Spider was there. He's in on it.
- Yeah.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.638
Forget about fucking Spider.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.183
He's dead.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.352
What?

03:49.855 --> 03:52.191
Wait, are you-- We were just with him.

03:52.816 --> 03:53.984
Yeah. But shortly after that,

03:53.984 --> 03:56.361
he was rolled out of a car
in front of a restaurant

03:56.361 --> 03:58.280
where Judd and Monteith were having lunch.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.615
Wait. Who killed him?

04:00.699 --> 04:02.075
Looks like Donovan.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.745
I imagine he felt
he wasn't getting anyone's attention.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.207
- They'd kill for the Grey Books?
- Yeah, it would seem so.

04:08.207 --> 04:10.542
Oh, for fuck's sake.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.044
Looks like she's in a house.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.171
Well, that narrows it down.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.589
Employee of the week.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.382
She's flinching.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.052
She's got a gun to her head.

04:20.844 --> 04:21.678
No.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.972
She wants to show us something.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.351
Zoom in right there
on that bit of the wall.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.731
Now that does narrow it down. Clever girl.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.943
Find the house
where those three kids grew up.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.989
Oh, come on. Cheer up.
He was an absolute prick.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.075
Where are you going?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.118
Church.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.442
All right, make this quick.
I've got underlings to bully. I'm busy.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.402
No one in Slough House is busy.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.070
Come on. Get on with it.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.199
The tiger team has killed one person
and taken two hostages.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.784
I don't know what they think
they're going to find in the Grey Books,

06:07.784 --> 06:09.077
but there's nothing of any value in them.

06:09.077 --> 06:13.373
So, I propose to give them what they want
so we get the hostages freed quickly,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.542
- and deal with them later.
- Okeydoke.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.587
I'd like you or your people
to escort them in and out.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.089
You would, would you?

06:21.089 --> 06:22.549
It's win-win. Trust me.

06:22.549 --> 06:26.053
Trust you?
Well, that's a topic for another day.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.138
You get Standish back quickly.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.391
And a favor from me
you can call in at anytime.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.145
Nah.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.813
Nah, I'm good.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.234
You know,
I've been caught like this before.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.694
"Oh, sorry, Jackson. We fucked up.
Do us a favor.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.905
Go through this door,
and everything will be sweet."

06:44.905 --> 06:46.240
The last time I did that,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.992
I walked in and found a severed head
on a fucking table.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.619
You can clean up your own shit.

06:50.619 --> 06:53.080
- It's not my shit.
- No, it's Judd's.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.458
And I think you want me
to help you roll him in it.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.924
- What are you gonna tell your wife?
- About what?

07:04.842 --> 07:06.176
About being fired.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.387
I wasn't planning on telling her anything.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.682
Surprisingly, my wife has very little
interest as to whether you're fired.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.767
She doesn't even know who you are, mate.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.352
We were both fired.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.897
Why would he fire me?
I wasn't the one caught with coke on me.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.149
"You're fucking fired.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.403
I've got fucking hemorrhoids
that are more fucking use than you."

07:24.403 --> 07:26.405
- That was the message.
- I know what the message was.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.531
He was talking about you.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.908
But you'll find out
when we get back to Slough House.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.201
Hemorrhoids is plural.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.871
- You don't get single hemorrhoids.
- Yeah, you do.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.539
All right. Well, you'd know.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.500
Why would he fire me?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.044
Well, because you're a
degenerate gambler for one thing.

07:41.044 --> 07:44.131
You got repetitive strain injury
from spinning roulette. Both hands.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.551
No, the players don't
actually spin the roulette themselves.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.596
And my little hobby doesn't affect my work
unlike your drug habit.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.515
No one can tell when I'm high.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.935
You do realize that's a bad thing, right?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.690
Hundred quid says it's both of us.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.776
500.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.029
- Really?
- You know what, fuck it. A grand.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.488
Done.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.698
Yeah. Done.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.160
There's no milk.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.039
That's because Catherine always gets it.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.501
So what do you think Lamb's got planned
once Ho finds the house?

08:22.753 --> 08:25.714
Well, I guess we ride in and get her.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.093
You're actually upset about Spider?

08:34.389 --> 08:38.769
I mean, I fucking hated the man.
I fucking hated him, but...

08:41.270 --> 08:44.691
you know, we were friends once.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.653
Really?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.241
Yeah.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.369
I think he used you a lot.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.957
And I think if it was the other way
around, he wouldn't really care.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.426
- Yep?
- River Cartwright?

09:11.426 --> 09:12.344
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:12.344 --> 09:15.222
I'm calling from the St. Joshua Club
where your grandfather was a member.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.306
Is a member.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.268
There's been a dispute
over his membership status--

09:19.268 --> 09:22.104
Why are you calling my grandson?
Don't you believe what I'm telling you?

09:22.104 --> 09:24.273
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know what that'll be.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.233
<i>Do you want to speak to him?</i>

09:27.192 --> 09:28.694
No, no, it's fine. I'll just--

09:30.571 --> 09:33.240
- I'll come down. It's not far.
- <i>If you don't mind.</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:34.366
Okay. Thanks.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.915
I've got to go
and sort my grandfather out.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.042
What? Now?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.294
Yeah, now.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.839
Thank you for the tea.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.758
I actually prefer it without milk, so...

10:02.144 --> 10:04.021
- So now we're wanted for murder.
- I am.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.981
I'm not letting you go off
on your own again.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.358
- It's all good.
- You killed someone.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.861
And now we'll get what we want.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.321
- Are you sure?
- They'll call.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.199
- And after that, what happens to you--
- It doesn't matter!

10:16.658 --> 10:18.452
First, we get justice for Alison.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.329
And once that's done,

10:20.329 --> 10:22.456
I'll take whatever justice
is coming my way.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.296
What are you going to do
with that man you've taken prisoner?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.214
Nothing.

10:30.214 --> 10:33.300
Is he your boss? Is he your hostage now?
He was going to let me go.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.636
We have to keep you
for a little while longer.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.763
We picked you for a reason.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.352
This? This is in the new storage facility.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.978
And you know all about that.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.731
You know what files are in what boxes
in what rooms.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.734
These are decommissioned documents.
They're of no interest--

10:50.734 --> 10:52.444
They're of interest to me.

10:52.444 --> 10:56.198
This was part of a set of files
originally marked for destruction.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.617
Then there should be no trouble
telling me exactly where it is.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.410
I'm sorry, I can't.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.579
I'd be in all sorts of trouble
if I did that.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.210
You're already in trouble.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.257
I know what you're capable of.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.592
But that gun to the head
was a piece of theater.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.095
So you're not going to hurt me.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.057
Okay.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.025
Everything I told you in that café
was the truth.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.194
Except your name.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.532
My name is Sean Donovan.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.869
I am an alcoholic.

11:45.664 --> 11:46.999
And I did lose someone.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.003
She was MI5.

11:56.925 --> 12:00.804
Her name was Alison Dunn.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.936
I loved her.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.449
After she died...

12:23.702 --> 12:25.162
I just fell apart.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.168
Sarah downstairs and Ben, to some extent,

12:31.168 --> 12:35.339
they picked me up, put me back together.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.177
Said Alison wouldn't want me
to blame myself.

12:42.346 --> 12:45.098
She'd want me to do the right thing
like she was trying to do.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.353
I worked with her at the embassy
in Istanbul.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.190
She was about to leak
this top secret file.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.611
Your people killed her for it.
Made it look like a suicide.

12:59.238 --> 13:03.617
It's natural to blame yourself
when someone takes their own life.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.494
Especially when it's someone
you were close to.

13:05.494 --> 13:09.206
I was with her right before.
She did not kill herself. MI5 did.

13:09.206 --> 13:12.376
No. No. We don't do that.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.545
We do questionable things,
but we don't do that.

13:14.545 --> 13:15.879
And how would you know?

13:15.879 --> 13:19.216
Before I worked at Slough House,
I worked for the head of MI5.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.385
- For Tearney?
- No.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.638
Charles Partner. He was the best they had.

13:25.681 --> 13:26.682
And a man like that,

13:26.682 --> 13:28.809
he wouldn't order a hit
on one of his own agents?

13:28.809 --> 13:32.354
No. Unless maybe they were a traitor.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.772
She was not a traitor.

13:34.857 --> 13:35.858
What's in the file?

13:38.026 --> 13:39.319
I don't know.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.282
But it made her turn against
the organization she worked for.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.326
We need to know where this is.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.579
Please, Catherine.

13:48.579 --> 13:50.747
That would mean me going against MI5.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.083
- I can't do that.
- You wouldn't be the only one.

13:53.083 --> 13:57.045
The reason we know this is in the facility
is because of a source at the Park.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.923
Somebody else who doesn't like
the questionable things going on there.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.801
I spent my life working for MI5.

14:02.801 --> 14:03.969
So did Alison.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.180
And they betrayed her.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.600
You still think these people
are worth protecting?

14:12.978 --> 14:15.856
- Ben! Ben!
- Sarah? Sarah!

14:19.276 --> 14:20.986
- You all right?
- Yeah.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.530
She went to check on Sturges.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.365
He said he wanted some water.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.745
Get in the house and watch Standish.
Come with me. We need to find him.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.293
Go that way. Meet me at the far gate. Go!

14:36.293 --> 14:37.252
All right.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.656
Geez.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.074
Ben!

15:40.524 --> 15:41.942
Let him go.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.083
Stop!

16:10.262 --> 16:13.557
<i>Bonjour.</i> Can I get a lift? Fuck it.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.644
What's the French for "drive"?
Drive! Go, go, go!

16:46.256 --> 16:47.174
You all right?

16:47.674 --> 16:48.550
There you are.

16:49.468 --> 16:50.594
What happened to your face?

16:53.263 --> 16:54.806
It was a filing accident.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.602
Tell that man he's mistaken, will you?

16:59.728 --> 17:01.855
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
he's not, is he?

17:01.855 --> 17:03.482
What are you talking about?

17:04.608 --> 17:06.818
I've been a member here for 50 years.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.695
Yes, and for the last few years,
you've hardly been here.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.824
What's that got to do with anything?
I still pay my dues.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.202
No, you don't.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.454
We talked about it, remember?

17:19.122 --> 17:22.626
You decided not to renew your membership
because you never use it.

17:23.544 --> 17:27.631
And what, you're saying
I wouldn't remember a decision like that?

17:27.631 --> 17:30.342
We were in the living room, by the fire.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.470
And how does that narrow it down?

17:34.054 --> 17:37.850
And you said half a century of membership
is enough.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.393
I didn't.

17:40.686 --> 17:44.022
And you cut the card up
and you threw it in the fire.

17:51.321 --> 17:54.533
- I'm afraid there are no phones in here.
- Yeah, yeah, no. I know that.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.719
- Yeah?
- <i>This is Ingrid Tearney.</i>

18:14.511 --> 18:15.971
<i>This morning was a disaster.</i>

18:19.349 --> 18:20.350
Are you there?

18:21.435 --> 18:24.813
Yeah, a disaster. I agree.

18:25.606 --> 18:28.233
<i>There's a way you can
wipe your slate clean.</i>

18:29.818 --> 18:30.944
Okay.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.946
The tiger team
want to look at the Grey Books.

18:33.447 --> 18:36.158
You walk them into the facility
and then out again.

18:37.743 --> 18:38.785
Is that it?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.955
That's it. Go there and wait for them.

18:47.336 --> 18:49.463
You're sure you want to involve
Slough House?

18:50.088 --> 18:52.424
Cartwright and Standish
are already part of it.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.886
If anything else goes wrong,
it's on them and Judd.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.554
When do I step in?

18:58.555 --> 19:00.891
Follow the tiger team
when they leave the facility.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.102
Once they release Standish, take them.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.480
Use Chieftain.

19:07.231 --> 19:09.608
They started this, so they can finish it.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.405
I'm sorry, my boy,
to drag you here for this.

19:15.405 --> 19:18.075
Oh, no. It's an easy mistake to make.

19:18.075 --> 19:20.744
It isn't that. I'm slipping.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.705
- Here.
- Thank you.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.332
You're not slipping.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.416
I am.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.254
Names, faces, places.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.173
They don't come to me
as easily as they used to.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.258
Where's my keys?

19:35.509 --> 19:37.344
It's okay. I'm sure it's just a phase.

19:37.845 --> 19:41.223
Right,
let's get you a taxi back to the station.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.307
Yes.

19:44.059 --> 19:48.146
So I just had a call from First Desk,
asking me for a favor.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.982
What sort of favor?

19:50.691 --> 19:53.193
To walk someone in and out
of a secure location.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.362
What happens after?

19:55.988 --> 19:57.239
Well, then someone's freed.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.033
So why the hesitation?

20:01.493 --> 20:04.079
Because there's always
another game being played, isn't there?

20:04.079 --> 20:06.248
That will probably leave me worse off.

20:06.248 --> 20:10.043
I just, you know,
can't quite see what this one is yet.

20:11.587 --> 20:12.629
What do you think?

20:13.797 --> 20:17.426
She's First Desk.
You'll have already said yes.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.929
You're only asking me
to make me feel better.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.142
See? You still got it.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.060
Cute.

20:38.447 --> 20:41.867
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm not a fucking soldier.

20:41.867 --> 20:45.120
- It's never your fault, is it?
- Why can't it be both our faults?

20:45.120 --> 20:49.041
Because your fuckup was first
and worst. As usual.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.169
- Why don't you just say it?
- What? Say what?

20:52.169 --> 20:54.296
That none of this would've happened
if Alison was still around.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.006
None of this would be happening
if Alison was around.

20:56.006 --> 20:59.176
- We're doing this because she was killed.
- You were always closer to her than me.

20:59.176 --> 21:01.762
But there's no need to make me feel
like shit because I'm the one left alive.

21:01.762 --> 21:04.181
- I'm not saying that.
- Yeah, you fucking are.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.933
The perfect fucking older sister,

21:05.933 --> 21:08.101
overachiever, always together,
is murdered.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.604
And you're stuck with
the crappy wayward one.

21:10.604 --> 21:14.274
- That's not what this is about.
- I'm sorry I'm so fucking useless.

21:16.902 --> 21:18.153
I thought Sean was crazy.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.280
You went back to him.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.658
You stopped him drinking his life away.
You did that.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.119
You said if there was any chance
she had been murdered,

21:26.119 --> 21:28.997
we shouldn't let it be in vain.
We should make it count.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.669
Yeah, and how's it fucking going, Ben?

21:33.669 --> 21:36.129
I let one hostage go,
and now we've lost Sean.

21:37.673 --> 21:38.799
He'll be back.

21:38.799 --> 21:41.093
And what if he's been hurt or caught?

21:59.903 --> 22:00.904
What?

22:02.739 --> 22:06.118
All I can give you is the room number.
Narrows it down a bit.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.036
Thank you.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.480
Where you been?

22:41.862 --> 22:43.113
I had to see my grandfather.

22:43.113 --> 22:46.491
Well, I hope you gave the old bastard
my disregards.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.703
Okay, I found seven houses
where kids with those names were raised.

22:49.703 --> 22:53.498
It's no fucking use. I don't have
seven good agents to dispatch.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.791
I don't even have one.

22:56.335 --> 22:59.338
Only four of the houses
are close enough to London to be viable.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.590
Well, if this is going somewhere, great,

23:01.590 --> 23:05.010
but I really don't need to know
the ins and outs of a cat's arse.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.554
And only one of the houses
is secluded enough

23:07.554 --> 23:09.431
to make sense as a hostage center.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.391
And this is where it gets interesting.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.643
Really?

23:12.643 --> 23:14.603
The Dunn family that owns the house

23:14.603 --> 23:16.104
used to hire out a bus for weddings.

23:17.481 --> 23:18.398
Get away.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.943
Said bus is here.

23:31.078 --> 23:31.912
Okay.

23:33.705 --> 23:36.834
Yeah, we'll take your car.
I need a kip en route.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.211
Hot Rod behind the wheel of the hot rod.

23:39.211 --> 23:42.548
You will drive
in absolute fucking silence.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.010
I think the Park are gonna
give Donovan what he wants, by the way.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.428
The Grey Books.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.098
They're gonna let him into
the facility under supervision.

23:51.098 --> 23:54.601
So, there's no need to go and get her.
She'll be released soon.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.436
Had a call from Tearney, did you?

23:58.063 --> 24:01.859
So Standish's freedom is in your hands?

24:01.859 --> 24:04.778
Well, if you don't mind,
I think I'll go get her myself.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.613
But you're fine with me going in?

24:07.197 --> 24:08.991
Yeah, if you fancy. Yeah.

24:08.991 --> 24:11.451
She asked me.
I told her to go fuck herself.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.245
Hey, you, come on.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.752
Fucking hell. Here we go.

24:22.004 --> 24:23.964
Come to clear your desks?

24:23.964 --> 24:26.175
- See? Plural.
- Hang on, what?

24:26.175 --> 24:27.551
You're honestly firing me too?

24:28.135 --> 24:31.763
Christ. It's like you can't sack anyone
around here without a phrase book.

24:31.763 --> 24:34.641
No, this is just, like,
a motivational scare, right?

24:34.641 --> 24:37.311
If your desks are not cleared
by the time I get back,

24:37.311 --> 24:39.980
I will set fire to them. And you too.

24:39.980 --> 24:40.939
What did I do?

24:40.939 --> 24:43.275
You can't follow simple instructions,

24:43.275 --> 24:46.653
and her eyeballs are still spinning
from whatever she shoved up her nostrils.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.405
- What instructions?
- Didn't get a chance to snort it.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.490
You disobeyed a direct order.

24:51.158 --> 24:55.245
I told you not to let anyone outside
of Slough House know about that flat.

24:55.245 --> 24:58.582
Within five minutes, you had
PC fucking Plod stomping all over it.

24:58.582 --> 24:59.666
So if it's all the same,

24:59.666 --> 25:02.753
I'd rather you piss off now
before you put me in a bad mood.

25:16.016 --> 25:18.227
Fuck me with a wire brush.

25:18.227 --> 25:20.896
I know. Total pussy magnet.

25:26.985 --> 25:30.239
Look, I just want to say
this is an absolute honor

25:30.239 --> 25:32.366
to be selected for fieldwork.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.451
Shut up.

25:34.451 --> 25:38.956
Got it. Strap in. This baby's g-forces
will hit you right in the tits.

25:38.956 --> 25:43.794
No, seriously. Shut up.
Or it'll be me hitting you in the tits.

25:48.799 --> 25:49.800
Liftoff.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.970
Jesus.

25:52.970 --> 25:54.054
Apologies.

25:54.805 --> 25:56.640
Milady needs a gentle touch.

26:06.191 --> 26:09.361
He got away. Flagged down a car.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.364
So now we're on the clock.

26:15.284 --> 26:17.828
I got a call from MI5.
I have to go to the facility.

26:18.328 --> 26:20.289
So Standish needs to come through now.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.208
Already has.

26:29.715 --> 26:31.091
How did you get this out of her?

26:31.091 --> 26:34.678
She just gave it up.
We managed to get through to her.

26:36.722 --> 26:39.099
Okay. Well done.

26:39.808 --> 26:40.809
So do we let her go?

26:40.809 --> 26:43.729
No, they need to think
that we still have her for leverage.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.153
In case she tries to leave.

26:51.153 --> 26:52.237
I won't need it.

26:53.488 --> 26:54.698
I can't take it with me.

26:58.202 --> 27:01.538
- I'm more use with you than I am here.
- No. No, no.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.707
I'm just gonna walk in and walk out.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.961
The last time you said that,
there was a body left on the pavement.

27:10.172 --> 27:11.507
I need to see this through.

27:14.092 --> 27:15.135
Okay then.

27:31.652 --> 27:32.778
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:35.239 --> 27:36.823
How was your grandfather?

27:38.700 --> 27:40.536
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Fine. Yeah.

27:42.829 --> 27:43.872
What's up?

27:45.707 --> 27:48.293
I've got an op. Kind of.

27:48.293 --> 27:50.754
To escort Donovan in
to see the Grey Books.

27:51.296 --> 27:52.756
Right, who did that come from?

27:54.007 --> 27:55.008
Tearney.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.177
Okay, let's go.

27:59.054 --> 28:00.222
I've got an op.

28:00.764 --> 28:02.307
Well, you can't do it on your own, River.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.142
Well, she asked me on my own.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.979
You just wanna hog the glory for yourself.

28:07.646 --> 28:10.732
It's not about glory.
I'm just doing as I'm told.

28:11.316 --> 28:12.609
Play it down all you want,

28:12.609 --> 28:15.320
but you are getting off
on a secret solo mission for First Desk

28:15.320 --> 28:17.072
without thinking what may go wrong.

28:18.365 --> 28:19.908
Wait, what makes you think it'll go wrong?

28:19.908 --> 28:21.326
Your track record.

28:21.326 --> 28:22.327
Right.

28:22.828 --> 28:24.496
Look, I'm offering backup, that's all.

28:24.496 --> 28:27.207
Yes, and thank you, but I don't need it.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.502
I don't need babysitting.

28:30.502 --> 28:32.754
My God, your ego is such a blind spot.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.007
Sorry, what?
You wanna talk about blind spots?

28:35.007 --> 28:37.217
No, I think I'm pretty self-aware.

28:37.217 --> 28:40.804
Ironically, that statement demonstrates
a complete lack of self-awareness.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.806
Donovan is a dangerous man.

28:43.390 --> 28:46.018
He killed Spider. You need backup.
It's as simple as that.

28:46.685 --> 28:49.271
Sorry, since when did you start keeping
a gun in the office?

28:50.439 --> 28:52.441
I think it's pretty easy
to track that moment.

28:54.735 --> 28:58.739
Okay, fine. You can come,
but I take the lead. And probably the gun.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.783
Nope. I'm keeping the gun.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.828
You can make yourself
a little sheriff's badge before we go,

29:04.828 --> 29:06.288
if it makes you feel tougher.

29:24.014 --> 29:26.225
- Excuse me. Do you have an appointment?
- Yes, love.

29:26.225 --> 29:29.144
- In what name?
- James Bond to see Mickey Mouse.

29:32.689 --> 29:33.941
No, thank you.

29:37.778 --> 29:41.657
Attention, weekend warriors.
Pack an extra pair of pants.

29:41.657 --> 29:45.536
Your collective wet dreams
are about to come true.

29:45.536 --> 29:47.079
What the fuck is this?

29:47.079 --> 29:51.500
General Monteith, your little outfit
seems to have overextended. What?

29:52.960 --> 29:53.961
Who the fuck are you?

29:54.461 --> 29:55.712
Nick Duffy.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.508
Dame Ingrid Tearney sent me.
From the Park.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.135
And in a bit of a switch,

30:03.136 --> 30:08.016
the private sector is about to learn
from the public.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.101
Oh, really?

30:09.643 --> 30:13.105
Well, thanks to our man escaping,
we now know where Standish is being held.

30:13.105 --> 30:14.273
So what you're telling me is that

30:14.273 --> 30:18.277
you've finally managed to locate
the whereabouts of a team that you hired.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.987
Well fucking done, General.

30:20.696 --> 30:22.322
We are going to go and apprehend them.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.449
No. No, you're not.

30:25.659 --> 30:30.873
For a start, you're out of your league.
Yeah? Bloody cosplay-paras.

30:30.873 --> 30:32.624
Oi, I've served.

30:33.792 --> 30:36.044
Where? McDonald's?

30:37.129 --> 30:40.382
Besides, they're not all gonna be there.

30:40.382 --> 30:44.303
Some of them are headed to
an MI5 document storage facility.

30:44.303 --> 30:49.933
We are all gonna go there and pick 'em up
after they've okayed Standish's release.

30:50.559 --> 30:52.019
Why should we do this?

30:52.853 --> 30:56.190
Because of the mess you made.
Your little company is toxic.

30:56.773 --> 31:00.319
And we are very kindly offering you
a way to rebrand. Take it.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.990
So all you lot, saddle up.
Whatever the fuck it is you do.

31:04.990 --> 31:08.619
And you, spill your fat piggy guts
about that tiger team,

31:08.619 --> 31:11.914
'cause I want to know who they are
so I can kick their bollocks clean off.

31:23.884 --> 31:26.094
Ma'am, we're en route to the facility.

31:26.094 --> 31:28.388
<i>Good.
I hope you put the shits up Monteith.</i>

31:28.388 --> 31:31.266
Yeah. We definitely gave him
a spike in blood pressure.

31:31.266 --> 31:34.269
Thank you for today, Nick.
You've done well.

31:34.269 --> 31:36.021
<i>Just doing my job, ma'am.</i>

31:36.021 --> 31:39.358
And I hope you'll be doing it
for a lot longer for me.

31:41.610 --> 31:43.612
So you'll be retaining command
from Taverner?

31:44.154 --> 31:46.114
Yes, think I will.

31:46.865 --> 31:48.408
She's got a lot on her plate.

31:48.408 --> 31:49.785
<i>I hope that suits you.</i>

31:50.285 --> 31:51.370
Yes, it does, ma'am.

31:52.371 --> 31:53.372
<i>Good.</i>

31:53.872 --> 31:56.667
I've got some detail on the tiger team.
There's three of them.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.752
<i>The leader is this guy
called Sean Donovan.</i>

31:58.752 --> 32:00.254
<i>He's ex-embassy security.</i>

32:00.879 --> 32:02.673
His last posting was Istanbul.

32:05.425 --> 32:06.635
Istanbul?

32:06.635 --> 32:09.638
<i>Yeah. So he's a pro,
but he's using non-pros.</i>

32:09.638 --> 32:10.806
<i>A pair of siblings.</i>

32:11.515 --> 32:14.393
<i>Only one of them has got
military experience, and it's minimal.</i>

32:14.393 --> 32:15.602
Why would he do that?

32:15.602 --> 32:17.187
The connection seems to be

32:17.187 --> 32:20.649
that he's been working
with their sister out in the embassy.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.151
What was the sister's name?

32:23.151 --> 32:25.737
<i>Alison Dunn. One of ours.</i>

32:25.737 --> 32:28.448
<i>She died out there last year. Suicide.</i>

32:29.867 --> 32:32.703
Yes, the name rings a bell.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.956
Thank you, Nick. Speak later.

33:13.702 --> 33:14.912
Dame Ingrid.

33:16.914 --> 33:18.957
I don't think you've ever been down here.

33:19.708 --> 33:23.045
A visit was long overdue.
How are you, Molly?

33:23.045 --> 33:24.254
Being looked after?

33:24.254 --> 33:26.757
No. But that's the way I like it.

33:28.217 --> 33:31.637
Shelf 27 is empty.

33:31.637 --> 33:35.933
Those are absolute dross. Half of them
were in codes we've lost the cipher for.

33:36.517 --> 33:39.269
So disposed of as requested?

33:40.395 --> 33:43.565
Actually, they were given
a last-minute reprieve.

33:44.191 --> 33:45.943
They were moved to the facility.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.110
Why the change?

33:47.110 --> 33:51.615
No idea. A different box
was ticked on a form, is all.

33:53.158 --> 33:54.243
Is it a problem?

33:54.993 --> 33:55.994
I hope not.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.747
If you want a name to tear strips off,

33:58.747 --> 34:01.458
Diana Taverner could probably
point you towards the culprit.

34:01.458 --> 34:04.378
She has oversight of the facility move.

34:06.088 --> 34:09.466
Yes, I'll check with her.
Thank you, Molly.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.039
You know that thing that Lamb said before?

34:44.126 --> 34:44.960
About...

34:47.588 --> 34:53.302
You know, the thing he said that crossed
about 15 different HR red lines,

34:53.302 --> 34:54.386
for a start.

34:55.469 --> 34:56.889
What? About me sleeping around?

34:57.639 --> 34:58.640
Yeah.

34:59.808 --> 35:02.269
You wondering if he's had me
in the stationery cupboard?

35:03.604 --> 35:06.899
No. I would-- No.

35:09.443 --> 35:13.989
What I was gonna say is that it's fine.

35:15.324 --> 35:16.658
It's none of his business.

35:17.326 --> 35:21.788
Because people process trauma
in different ways.

35:23.498 --> 35:26.460
What-- I don't understand. What's fine?

35:27.544 --> 35:28.545
That.

35:30.923 --> 35:33.383
How you're choosing
to process your trauma.

35:33.884 --> 35:35.636
Cartwright, please stop talking.

35:35.636 --> 35:38.555
Sorry, I should have said that
maybe you should talk to someone.

35:38.555 --> 35:39.640
About my sex life?

35:40.849 --> 35:42.059
About Min.

35:42.768 --> 35:44.311
Right, okay. I--

35:45.062 --> 35:47.314
It's so irritating when people say that.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.815
- Wh--
- It's just so simp--

35:48.815 --> 35:50.192
What do I say?

35:51.193 --> 35:52.653
- I don't know what you'd say.
- Exactly.

35:52.653 --> 35:55.739
What is there to say
that's gonna make any difference?

35:56.490 --> 35:57.574
There's nothing.

35:58.659 --> 36:01.495
Shit happens.
You pick yourself up and move on.

36:01.495 --> 36:06.208
And, you know, that's life.
You move forward. That's all you can do.

36:06.208 --> 36:08.502
You move forward towards your own death.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.634
Yeah. No, you're right. You do.

36:15.634 --> 36:18.637
- You sound like you're in a great place.
- What? And you are?

36:19.346 --> 36:21.557
- It's not-- It's--
- Why don't you go and talk to someone

36:21.557 --> 36:23.725
about your constant need
to prove yourself to people?

36:24.434 --> 36:26.311
They'll tell you
it's because you don't know your dad

36:26.311 --> 36:28.897
and your mom abandoned you,
so you never feel good enough.

36:28.897 --> 36:31.149
And trying to live up
to your grandfather's legacy

36:31.149 --> 36:32.609
only exacerbates your inadequacy.

36:36.196 --> 36:38.198
Wow. I was just trying to help you.

36:38.198 --> 36:41.034
But I didn't ask for your help, River.
I don't want any help.

36:41.034 --> 36:44.204
Okay, yeah. No, you didn't. Fine.

36:44.204 --> 36:46.164
Like, why'd you have to bring that up?

36:57.759 --> 36:59.094
What are you doing?

36:59.094 --> 37:01.263
I don't know.

37:03.140 --> 37:06.268
Okay, well, now this feels uncomfortable
and awkward, so-- Okay.

37:08.103 --> 37:10.856
- Feel better though, don't you?
- Yeah, okay.

37:11.690 --> 37:12.774
Oh, Lord.

37:18.864 --> 37:19.865
I miss him.

37:23.952 --> 37:25.162
Just miss him.

37:29.291 --> 37:30.417
Yeah, I know.

37:35.297 --> 37:36.965
Wait. Who have you lost?

37:40.135 --> 37:42.846
Not lost. Losing.

37:44.681 --> 37:46.141
Losing someone at the moment.

37:47.309 --> 37:48.352
Really? Who?

37:50.979 --> 37:51.980
Donovan.

37:51.980 --> 37:53.232
What?

37:54.149 --> 37:55.234
No. Donovan.

38:15.546 --> 38:17.339
River Cartwright. Louisa Guy.

38:17.339 --> 38:21.301
Once you've seen what you need to see,
Catherine Standish is to be released.

38:21.301 --> 38:22.469
Understood?

38:23.679 --> 38:24.805
How is she?

38:25.472 --> 38:27.391
- Unharmed?
- Of course.

38:30.394 --> 38:32.896
You did a good job this morning,
getting into the Park.

38:33.772 --> 38:35.941
Sorry if it came back to bite you.

38:37.109 --> 38:38.110
It's fine.

38:39.862 --> 38:41.321
Are you sure this is the place?

38:42.197 --> 38:44.408
You sure lasers
are controlling the weather?

38:45.200 --> 38:46.201
Arms out.

38:52.457 --> 38:53.542
Anyone?

38:54.084 --> 38:56.128
- Well, I'm not doing it. You.
- I thought-- You--

38:57.754 --> 38:58.755
Yeah.

39:32.873 --> 39:35.792
<i>Please present
your Service IDs at the scanner.</i>

39:41.256 --> 39:45.052
<i>Your hair is different
on your Service photo.</i>

39:46.845 --> 39:47.846
<i>I dyed it.</i>

39:47.846 --> 39:49.306
<i>I prefer it natural.</i>

39:50.182 --> 39:51.225
Open the door.

39:51.225 --> 39:52.559
<i>You're not on the list.</i>

39:52.559 --> 39:54.686
Well, I don't give a shit.
Open the fucking door!

39:54.686 --> 39:57.147
- Okay. Maybe let me try.
- Jesus Christ.

40:02.402 --> 40:03.487
<i>Cartwright.</i>

40:03.987 --> 40:06.114
- Sorry. Have we met?
- <i>No. No.</i>

40:06.114 --> 40:07.574
<i>But I know your handiwork.</i>

40:07.574 --> 40:13.205
<i>Your itemizing skills are,
pardon my French,</i> absolument merde.

40:13.205 --> 40:16.291
<i>Which is genuine French for
"absolutely shit."</i>

40:16.291 --> 40:19.086
Yeah, look, listen.
We need to escort these men in

40:19.086 --> 40:20.420
to take a peek at the Grey Books.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.756
- <i>It's unscheduled.</i>
- <i>Ingrid Tearney sent us.</i>

40:22.756 --> 40:25.759
<i>You know who that is? Head of MI5.
You wanna give her a call?</i>

40:25.759 --> 40:26.885
<i>No need.</i>

40:26.885 --> 40:29.763
<i>Said it was unscheduled,
not that it wasn't possible.</i> Entrer.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.605
Welcome to the domain of Douglas.

40:48.949 --> 40:51.869
Right. Would you like the full tour?

40:51.869 --> 40:52.870
No.

40:53.996 --> 40:55.706
- Edited highlights?
- No.

40:55.706 --> 40:58.250
Point us towards the Grey Books, please.

40:59.293 --> 41:01.336
To my mind, they're the highlights.

41:01.336 --> 41:02.629
Crazy shit.

41:03.547 --> 41:06.925
Kindly accompany me to the nerve center
from where you may proceed.

41:08.927 --> 41:11.471
Hey, your hair
really has changed color, you know.

41:11.471 --> 41:13.807
I know.
I was there when it happened.

41:14.725 --> 41:17.311
X marks the spot. Room.

41:18.228 --> 41:23.108
And once in there,
I've written the shelf and row number.

41:24.276 --> 41:25.277
Have fun.

41:26.778 --> 41:27.863
We will.

41:54.765 --> 41:57.226
And who might you be?

42:02.314 --> 42:05.943
Right, so it should be up here.
Yeah, here it is.

42:07.027 --> 42:11.114
There you are. All right.
As Douglas said, the shelf numbers--

42:11.114 --> 42:12.199
What the fuck?

42:12.699 --> 42:13.825
What are you doing?

42:13.825 --> 42:15.911
- Donovan. The fuck you doing?
- Stop.

42:16.495 --> 42:18.038
- I said stop!
- Oi--

42:19.540 --> 42:21.166
Oh, my God. That was loud.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.209
On your knees.

42:24.211 --> 42:25.671
We came here to get something.

42:25.671 --> 42:26.755
The Grey Books.

42:26.755 --> 42:28.048
And we're going to get it.

42:28.048 --> 42:31.134
- They're in there. So where are you going?
- You can shoot me.

42:31.134 --> 42:34.221
But it will be in my back,
and I am unarmed,

42:34.221 --> 42:35.722
which doesn't look very good.

42:36.723 --> 42:39.268
That said, you people are very good
at covering up murders.

42:39.268 --> 42:40.894
Now, we're gonna turn around.

42:40.894 --> 42:42.896
We're gonna keep walking
until we find what we came here for.

42:42.896 --> 42:43.981
No, you're not.

42:44.481 --> 42:45.774
- Yes, they are.
- I'm--

42:47.234 --> 42:49.444
Well, they called your bluff
and you were bluffing.

42:49.945 --> 42:51.697
Thanks for the collective responsibility.

42:57.202 --> 42:58.704
- <i>Ma'am.</i>
- Are they out?

42:58.704 --> 42:59.830
Negative.

43:00.330 --> 43:01.915
<i>Donovan doesn't want the Grey Books.</i>

43:01.915 --> 43:05.669
Someone's put something in there for him
to retrieve and it cannot get out.

43:06.545 --> 43:08.380
- Understood.
- <i>Nor can he.</i>

43:09.256 --> 43:10.966
<i>Nor anyone else
he's come into contact with.</i>

43:10.966 --> 43:12.509
<i>I don't know what he might've told them.</i>

43:12.509 --> 43:15.888
This is for the sake of the Service.
You understand?

43:17.472 --> 43:19.057
You saying, "Clear the board"?

43:20.601 --> 43:21.602
Yes.

43:22.936 --> 43:24.062
Clear the board.

43:33.197 --> 43:34.198
Change of plan.

43:35.032 --> 43:37.117
Every fucker out. Arm up.

43:38.952 --> 43:41.538
- Come on. Chop, chop. Leave if--
- You lucky boys.

43:41.538 --> 43:43.957
You've got a chance
to boost your kill count.

43:43.957 --> 43:47.544
Jesus Christ, it's like
the fucking Red Arrows, but shit.

43:47.544 --> 43:50.130
Arm up. Live rounds.

43:50.130 --> 43:53.509
<i>You will take no prisoners.
You will shoot to kill.</i>

43:54.134 --> 43:58.680
<i>Everyone who went into that facility
is coming out in a body bag.</i>
