00:02.819 --> 00:04.753
♪ ♪

00:20.170 --> 00:22.262
Well, everybody take
a good look at Louise.

00:22.414 --> 00:24.189
'Cause it's probably
the last time

00:24.341 --> 00:25.599
you're ever gonna see her.

00:25.751 --> 00:27.267
Is it because you're
turning invisible?

00:27.419 --> 00:28.877
It's ethically fraught.
I don't recommend it.

00:28.954 --> 00:31.864
No, today's the day I have to
meet Millie at the park,

00:32.015 --> 00:34.849
in the woods,
for the "super-secret surprise."

00:34.869 --> 00:37.778
Oh, yeah.
Well, surprises can be fun.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.372
-Right?
-Uh-huh. When I tried
to ask Millie about it,

00:40.599 --> 00:43.024
she put her finger on my lips
and said, "Soon, my sweet."

00:43.044 --> 00:46.361
And then she stroked my face
while humming a lullaby.

00:46.455 --> 00:48.955
-Oh, God.
-Yep, so it's been nice
knowing everyone.

00:49.124 --> 00:50.440
I mean, pretty nice.

00:50.534 --> 00:52.367
Louise, couldn't you just
not go?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.628
I got to go, Dad.
I owe Millie big.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.282
She gave me this super-rare
Burobu card, The Slug-gitive.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.392
His backstory is he was framed
for his wife's murder.

01:00.619 --> 01:02.394
They stopped printing 'em
'cause they realized

01:02.621 --> 01:03.954
most kids haven't seen
<i> The Fugitive.</i>

01:03.972 --> 01:07.140
That card's the most important
thing in my life now.

01:07.293 --> 01:09.717
Good for you. Tina, breakfast!

01:09.737 --> 01:12.071
Here I am. Sorry.
I've just been staring at myself

01:12.298 --> 01:13.630
in the bathroom
for the past hour.

01:13.723 --> 01:15.966
Were you pumping yourself up
to do toilet stuff?

01:16.059 --> 01:18.226
No. Yes. But also, um,

01:18.395 --> 01:19.894
do you guys think I'm pretty?

01:19.988 --> 01:21.488
-What?!
-What? Of-of course we do.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.248
You're the most beautiful
person or thing that's ever

01:23.475 --> 01:25.084
been born in the entire world.

01:25.235 --> 01:26.734
Same with Gene and Louise.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.253
(smooches)
Love ya, babe.

01:28.405 --> 01:30.163
It's just,
the other day at school,

01:30.257 --> 01:31.982
Tammy and Jocelyn
were talking about

01:32.075 --> 01:33.908
this online tutorial
they watched where a girl

01:34.077 --> 01:35.928
shows you how to do your makeup
like a supermodel.

01:36.079 --> 01:37.412
I asked them to send me
the link, and they said

01:37.431 --> 01:39.506
that I wasn't really
supermodel material.

01:39.658 --> 01:41.491
And that I was more like
the person who brings

01:41.585 --> 01:44.177
the supermodels coffee
but gets the order wrong,

01:44.330 --> 01:46.330
but the supermodels
are really nice about it

01:46.348 --> 01:47.922
'cause they're pretty
inside and out.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.833
Those punks!
You want me to drive by 'em

01:49.852 --> 01:51.276
and smack 'em with my car door?

01:51.503 --> 01:52.185
-Lin.
-What?

01:52.338 --> 01:53.687
Ugh.
Why do you care

01:53.763 --> 01:56.356
about girly stuff like makeup
and being pretty anyway?

01:56.508 --> 01:59.785
I mean, faces are just
a bunch of holes in one place.

01:59.936 --> 02:02.270
(deep voice): Oh, my face holes
are in a better spot

02:02.289 --> 02:03.864
than your face holes.

02:04.016 --> 02:06.016
It's when your bottom hole
is in the wrong spot.

02:06.034 --> 02:07.292
That's when to worry.

02:07.444 --> 02:09.110
Besides, Tina, the bigger issue

02:09.130 --> 02:10.612
is that it's Millie Park Day.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.447
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.800
And I was kind of hoping maybe
you and Gene could come with me?

02:14.969 --> 02:17.636
I could use some muscle.
And also Gene.

02:17.787 --> 02:19.245
You had me at "also Gene."

02:19.365 --> 02:22.199
I'll go, too. At least the
squirrels won't be all judgy.

02:22.201 --> 02:24.143
That one is.
Thinks he's so great.

02:24.294 --> 02:26.436
-With his big nuts.
-Gene.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.206
Hi, I have a flower delivery

02:29.299 --> 02:32.042
-for this address.
-Ooh, flowers.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.652
Wait a minute,
are those flowers a dog?

02:33.803 --> 02:36.563
Yes ma'am. It's a
Bow-Wow-Flower arrangement.

02:36.715 --> 02:38.806
I love it!
Technology, huh?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.492
Unbelievable what they can do.

02:40.644 --> 02:42.644
-Who's it from?
-Yeah, where's the card?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.404
That's... a fair question.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.665
-Okay.
-That I was kind of...

02:46.892 --> 02:49.484
hoping didn't come up, because
I think it fell off somehow.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.653
As we say in the flower
business, sorry about that.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.247
Aw. You know, it kind
of reminds me of this dog

02:54.400 --> 02:56.175
that lived next door
when I was a kid.

02:56.402 --> 02:58.010
He was a white mutt
named Bottle Cap.

02:58.237 --> 02:59.845
They called him that
'cause he could balance

03:00.072 --> 03:01.496
a bottle cap on his nose.

03:01.590 --> 03:03.498
He would entertain us
neighborhood kids for hours.

03:03.592 --> 03:05.851
Letting us put bottle caps
on his nose.

03:06.002 --> 03:07.761
And one time,
a doll's head we found.

03:07.913 --> 03:09.671
-That was weird. He was
-Uh-huh

03:09.690 --> 03:12.708
cooler than any dog or person
that I ever met.

03:12.768 --> 03:14.860
He taught us so much about life,

03:15.011 --> 03:16.862
about balancing stuff
on our noses.

03:17.013 --> 03:18.755
I am who I am
because of that dog.

03:18.848 --> 03:22.275
-Wait, really?
-And then he got hit
by a hot dog truck and died.

03:22.428 --> 03:25.278
-Whoa.
-Oh. Lin. I'm-I'm so sorry.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.854
Yeah. Dog, hot dog.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.541
It's almost funny.
(laughing)

03:29.768 --> 03:32.118
Oh, I'm laughing
'cause I'm fine.

03:32.271 --> 03:33.879
Well, I'm gonna take off.

03:34.106 --> 03:35.605
-Have a good one.
-Bye, flower man.

03:35.624 --> 03:37.123
Okay, Bottle Cap Two,

03:37.276 --> 03:38.533
let's put you on the counter.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.460
I'll set out a little
bowl of kibble for ya.

03:40.612 --> 03:43.280
(laughs) Just kidding,
I know you're flowers.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.115
I know he's flowers.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.633
I know that-that you know.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.229
(baby talk): I know you're
flowers. I know you're flowers.

03:50.456 --> 03:52.213
Shoot, Tina,
we should have worked

03:52.233 --> 03:54.233
on your leg sweep.
We got to be prepared

03:54.460 --> 03:55.976
to drop that
little maniac on her...

03:56.070 --> 03:57.569
-Psst.
-ALL: Aah!

03:57.721 --> 03:59.312
Millie!
There's my girl.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.965
So, Tina and Gene
just happen to be here.

04:01.984 --> 04:03.166
Not with me.

04:03.226 --> 04:05.077
We're here to throw a Frisbee.

04:05.228 --> 04:07.153
Back and forth.
To each other.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.081
Uh, where's the Frisbee?

04:09.232 --> 04:10.898
We're working up to it.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.251
We're about 90 days away.

04:12.402 --> 04:14.478
-Yep, okay, bye.
-So what's

04:14.496 --> 04:17.256
the cool surprise? And you're
coming at me... Oh, God!

04:17.332 --> 04:18.590
Wait, wh-what are you doing?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.317
There's a camera
and a microphone in the bow

04:20.410 --> 04:21.985
that I'm
attaching to your bunny ear.

04:22.078 --> 04:24.170
In your human ear,
I'll be putting a device thingie

04:24.265 --> 04:25.989
that allows us to communicate.

04:26.082 --> 04:27.657
It's all connected
to my Dad's phone.

04:27.751 --> 04:29.434
He uses all this stuff
for his mountain biking videos

04:29.661 --> 04:31.995
even though I would call them
slight-hill biking videos.

04:32.014 --> 04:33.513
And I have my Mom's phone,

04:33.665 --> 04:35.832
so I'll be able to see what
you see and hear what you hear.

04:35.834 --> 04:38.018
-Uh...
-I told them I was
upgrading their ringtone.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.945
They were both very excited.

04:40.096 --> 04:41.505
Millie, what is going on?

04:41.523 --> 04:43.448
Have you heard about
the Pixie Princess Promenade?

04:43.600 --> 04:46.176
-Oh, no.
-Where pixie princesses
take you on a magical adventure

04:46.194 --> 04:48.436
through the park
-that changes you forever?
-No, please.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.680
I've been on nine of them.
I may have gotten

04:50.774 --> 04:52.032
a little intense
on the last one.

04:52.184 --> 04:54.275
I allegedly headbutted a gnome
in the chest.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.036
And then I was disinvited
to pixie-ticipate.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.445
Don't say
this is where I come in.

04:57.539 --> 04:59.131
-So this is where you come in.
-Oh, God.

04:59.282 --> 05:01.282
I need you to do the Pixie
Princess Promenade for me.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.801
I need some
pixie princess action.

05:02.952 --> 05:04.878
Plus, they hand out wands
at the end.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.471
I already have eight wands,
but I need more.

05:06.623 --> 05:08.365
I want all the colors,
I want all the flowers.

05:08.383 --> 05:09.883
They put different
flower stickers on the wands.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.477
I want pink rose.
You're gonna get me pink rose.

05:12.629 --> 05:15.430
Um... no.
Definitely not, never, no.

05:15.541 --> 05:17.983
Well, then I am forced
and legally allowed

05:18.210 --> 05:20.043
to demand that you give me back
the Slug-gitive card.

05:20.062 --> 05:23.063
Ugh! I knew there had to be
strings attached with that card.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.715
Okay, so if I get you the wand,
then we're square?

05:25.734 --> 05:28.994
Square as a bear
in a chair with no hair. (gasps)

05:29.221 --> 05:31.663
There are the pixie princesses
and the pixie princess queen.

05:31.890 --> 05:33.223
Oh, dear Lord.

05:33.241 --> 05:35.892
Whoa. Is that a magical
flying sex worker convention?

05:36.061 --> 05:37.669
Oh, it's the Pixie
Princess Promenade.

05:37.821 --> 05:39.913
-The what?
-I did it a few times
when I was younger.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.840
It was fun.
Then I moved on to horses.

05:41.991 --> 05:43.342
And I've been chasing that H
ever since.

05:43.569 --> 05:45.510
Oh, I almost forgot.
My pixie wings.

05:45.662 --> 05:49.422
-Ugh.
-Now you can sparkle and fly
with the pixies up high.

05:49.591 --> 05:53.426
This is gonna be the best
three hours of your life! Aah!

05:53.579 --> 05:56.563
-I think I'm gonna throw up.
-From enchantment?

06:01.010 --> 06:02.527
Oh, God.
So girly.

06:02.679 --> 06:05.271
Hey. May we, uh, join you?
We're just taking a break.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.257
Also our fake Frisbee
got stuck in a tree.

06:07.350 --> 06:08.925
So what's, uh...
what's going on?

06:09.018 --> 06:10.260
Louise is doing the Pixie

06:10.278 --> 06:12.112
Princess Promenade for me
'cause I'm banned.

06:12.264 --> 06:14.264
-Okay.
-I got a pixie haircut once.

06:14.357 --> 06:16.023
It worked until it didn't.

06:16.118 --> 06:18.359
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Tina? Gene? Is that you?</i>
<i> I need you</i>

06:18.379 --> 06:20.194
to find a rock,
throw it at my head,

06:20.214 --> 06:21.788
and I'll have myself
a nice rock nap.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.608
<i> MILLIE:</i>
<i> Oh, I love how excited</i>
<i> we both are, Louise.</i>

06:24.701 --> 06:27.552
-Why, hello.
I'm Pixie Princess Patricia.
-(loud gasps)

06:27.721 --> 06:30.389
Would you like to go
on a Pixie Princess adventure?

06:30.616 --> 06:31.965
-ALL: Yay!
-Ugh.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.618
Only pixies allowed,
so human parents and guardians,

06:34.711 --> 06:38.379
we ask you to wait in what
you call "the parking lot."

06:38.473 --> 06:39.881
ALL:
Yay!

06:39.900 --> 06:40.882
What a wonderful day.

06:40.976 --> 06:42.734
I've been busy
using my magic wand

06:42.886 --> 06:44.644
to make the flowers
extra pretty.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.465
And I was just about to enjoy
a nice twirl in the sunlight.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.242
Do you pixies know how to twirl?

06:50.393 --> 06:53.412
-ALL: Yeah.
-Let's all twirl together.

06:53.563 --> 06:54.562
-ALL: Yeah!
-Ugh.

06:54.656 --> 06:56.156
<i> MILLIE:</i>
<i> Louise, I need you to twirl.</i>

06:56.250 --> 06:57.899
-Millie, please.
<i> -Twirl.</i>

06:57.993 --> 06:58.975
(Louise groans)

06:58.994 --> 07:00.252
Yes!

07:00.328 --> 07:01.753
Oh, wait.
My wings are tingling.

07:01.980 --> 07:04.648
The other pixie princesses must
be trying to tell me something.

07:04.666 --> 07:05.999
(gasps):
Oh, no!

07:06.151 --> 07:07.333
It seems someone has stolen

07:07.428 --> 07:09.577
the Pixie Princess Queen's
sparkle sprinkles.

07:09.671 --> 07:12.931
That's what gives our magic
wands their magic power.

07:13.082 --> 07:14.749
Is sparkle sprinkles drugs?

07:14.843 --> 07:16.768
I don't remember.
I don't think so?

07:16.920 --> 07:19.271
We've got to find the Princess
Queen's sparkle sprinkles.

07:19.498 --> 07:21.440
But first, let's twirl again

07:21.591 --> 07:24.609
-for strength. Twirl!
-ALL: Yeah!
-Ugh.

07:24.836 --> 07:27.446
I remember when I could twirl.
Then time caught up with me.

07:27.597 --> 07:30.449
Now I get dizzy looking
at a rotisserie chicken.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.308
So, yeah, kablam.

07:32.310 --> 07:35.345
And then it was hot dogs
and a dead dog. Ha!

07:35.363 --> 07:37.180
But now I got this guy.
You know what?

07:37.199 --> 07:38.364
I'm gonna go get
the spray bottle

07:38.517 --> 07:40.107
and give him a little spritz.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.185
-He's looking a little wilty.
-Okay, sounds good.

07:42.187 --> 07:45.021
-♪<i> La-la-la, la, la-la-la-la</i> ♪
-Bob?

07:45.040 --> 07:46.781
-♪<i> Bottle cap two.</i> ♪
-Bob? Bob?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.300
What? Why are you whispering?

07:48.527 --> 07:50.376
That was the saddest story
I've ever heard in my life.

07:50.529 --> 07:53.472
I think maybe Linda never
processed Bottle Cap's death.

07:53.623 --> 07:55.640
Yeah. It is weird
she never mentioned it.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.383
Maybe she tried to block it out?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.293
Or maybe you haven't been
a sensitive enough partner

07:59.387 --> 08:01.538
for her to feel safe
opening up to you?

08:01.556 --> 08:02.964
-What?
-It's probably the first thing.

08:03.058 --> 08:05.150

was about something else.

you headbutted the gnome?

Oh, gnome you didn't.

09:00.189 --> 09:02.374
-Hey, there.
-Oh, uh, a pixie.

09:02.483 --> 09:04.042
Didn't expect to see
one of you for a while.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.785
-Let me, uh, gnome up.
-Oh, you don't have to do that.

09:05.937 --> 09:07.712
(clears throat, high-pitched):
I'm the gnome-iest gnome.

09:07.939 --> 09:10.215

with my rhyming

09:11.993 --> 09:13.051

Look, I know this is the end.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.946
-D'uh... Uh...
-I mean, that sign

09:16.965 --> 09:18.448
is kind of a tip off.

09:18.466 --> 09:20.617
And, hey, I know
you took the sparkle sprinkles.

09:20.619 --> 09:22.952
And I don't judge you for that,
but the wands they give out?

09:23.046 --> 09:24.470
I need a pink rose one.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.639
-What?
-So if you want to just
gnome it on over to me.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.626
Look, kid, I'm not gonna
just give you a pink rose wand.

09:29.628 --> 09:31.069
That's not how this works.

09:31.220 --> 09:33.646
You got to earn the wand.
Now scoot.

09:33.799 --> 09:35.115
You made me break character.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.983
I got to get back in the zone.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.393
Off with you, leave me alone.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.395
-There. There he is. He's back.
-Ugh.

is a forest person now.

and head home?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.854
I guess?

-Their PPP.
-Yes. And they should
enjoy that time.

11:43.094 --> 11:45.203
Because before they know it,
they'll be 13 and people will be

supermodel material and also

we have to stay in the park?

12:07.376 --> 12:08.560
Okay, great.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.544
Bob, I've been thinking,
we should just keep buying

12:10.564 --> 12:13.064
this same flower arrangement
and switch it out

12:13.216 --> 12:14.232
when Linda's asleep.

12:14.383 --> 12:16.234
And just do that
for the rest of her life?

12:16.461 --> 12:19.979
Okay. Uh, lot of flowers,
but that could-could work.

12:20.131 --> 12:21.889
Hey, Bob, Teddy.
There it is.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.909
That Bow-Wow-Flower arrangement
was supposed to go to my place

12:25.061 --> 12:26.244
for a service this afternoon.

12:26.395 --> 12:28.062
-Oh.
-Oh.
-Mrs. Goldenblatt.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.582
She wanted a "Doggone it,
she's gone"-themed funeral.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.917
I called the delivery place
and they said

12:33.069 --> 12:34.143
they accidentally
brought it here.

12:34.162 --> 12:35.903
So I'll just be taking this.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.146
-Oh, no.
-Uh-oh.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.648
-What?
-LINDA: Hey, Mort.

12:38.741 --> 12:40.149
Have you met Bottle Cap Two?

12:40.318 --> 12:41.501
He's named after Bottle Cap,

12:41.577 --> 12:43.202
the dog I loved
from my childhood

12:43.263 --> 12:45.913
that got hit by a truck
and died right in front of me.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.432
Wait, it was in front of you?

12:47.583 --> 12:49.325
It just keeps getting
more horrific.

12:49.344 --> 12:52.011
But this guy's not gonna
die on me, are you, huh?

12:52.163 --> 12:53.663
No, you're not.

12:53.756 --> 12:55.498
Or I could wait a bit.

12:55.591 --> 12:58.184
I'm holding so many.
So much power.

12:58.261 --> 12:59.852

13:00.005 --> 13:02.096

them so hard, please.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.356
Thank you.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.359
Look, Millie, you got
your wands, so seems like

13:06.453 --> 13:08.453
time for me to shove on
out of this bush.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.180
What? No! If they find you,
they'll make you talk,

13:11.274 --> 13:13.458
probably with torture,
and then they'll find the wands

13:13.609 --> 13:15.018
and then they'll probably
take them back.

13:15.036 --> 13:17.687
And then I'll have
to take Slug-gitive back.

13:17.705 --> 13:19.798
-I won't give it to you.
-Then I'll come and get it.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.282
In the night.
I was planning to come by

13:21.301 --> 13:22.616
and get some other stuff anyway.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.694
-Ugh! Fine.
-Uh-oh.

13:24.712 --> 13:25.970
My Mom's phone is gone.

13:26.197 --> 13:28.714
(gasps) It must have fallen out
when we were running.

13:28.867 --> 13:29.866
Hey, no licking.

It's them. Quick, hide.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.055
So, I thought

13:36.207 --> 13:37.298
we could just slowly incorporate

13:37.392 --> 13:39.300
that the gnome
also does beatboxing.

13:39.394 --> 13:41.210
And he wears a jean jacket.

13:41.229 --> 13:42.803
Stop. What's this?

13:42.897 --> 13:44.322
(gasps)
I think that's Millie's phone.

13:44.473 --> 13:46.825

beatbox in a jean jacket.

14:01.733 --> 14:03.875
And, uh, if it seems like
they're about to find everybody,

14:04.027 --> 14:05.677
maybe you could
cause a distraction?

14:05.904 --> 14:07.253
-So I could warn Louise?
-Oh.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.405
If I could do a split,
you could be like,

14:09.498 --> 14:11.182
"Hey, look at that kid
doing a split."

14:11.334 --> 14:13.000
So I just have to learn
how to do a split.

14:13.094 --> 14:14.185
Yeah, that could work.

14:14.337 --> 14:15.745
-(Linda humming)
-Okay,

14:15.763 --> 14:17.080
I think we should make a move.

14:17.173 --> 14:18.172
All right. Good luck.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.083
I mean, I'm-I'm coming, too.

14:20.101 --> 14:21.175

14:21.252 --> 14:22.919
Also, I<i> actually</i> can't watch

14:23.012 --> 14:24.587

fix a guy's roof.

14:24.606 --> 14:26.698

hours ago. He'll understand.

14:26.925 --> 14:28.441

14:29.703 --> 14:31.761
-Uh, about the flowers...
-Yeah?

14:31.779 --> 14:34.706
The thing is, they were actually
supposed to go to Mort's.

14:34.857 --> 14:36.949
Yeah, they're for
a funeral today,

14:37.102 --> 14:38.951
so I-I need to take them.

14:39.104 --> 14:40.861
Oh. Huh. I see.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.772
Are you okay with that?

14:42.774 --> 14:44.290
What? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.867
-Uh, good.
-They're just flowers, Bob.

14:46.961 --> 14:51.372

the flowers and backing away.

14:51.466 --> 14:52.873
No.

use the bathroom real quick.

14:56.137 --> 14:58.897

Okay, Millie,
that was pretty cool

15:25.333 --> 15:26.332
how you left
the other phone there

15:26.484 --> 15:28.242
to give us a chance to get away,

15:28.261 --> 15:30.411
-but now what?
-I think we just walk to Canada,

15:30.488 --> 15:32.338
and you and me
get an apartment there together.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.432
Why did you even have
that bow camera anyway?

15:34.583 --> 15:36.492
She got banned
from the promenade thing.

15:36.511 --> 15:39.604
Wait, so you can't
pixie-ticipate anymore?

15:39.755 --> 15:40.939
-Nope.
-Ever?

15:41.090 --> 15:42.498
-Nope.
-Curse word.

15:42.591 --> 15:43.757
Sorry about my language.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.277
Um, hello? We're all
on the run, apparently.

15:46.429 --> 15:48.262
Pretty sure everyone here
is getting banned.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.930
-What?!
-Ah, curse word! Sorry.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.024
Then what's the point
of anything?

15:52.177 --> 15:53.526
Okay, that's it.

15:53.678 --> 15:56.270
Look, maybe getting banned
is the best thing

15:56.289 --> 15:58.289
that could happen to you.
You, too, Millie.

15:58.441 --> 15:59.773
What are you talking about?

15:59.793 --> 16:01.534
I'm talking about the fact
that you could be free.

16:01.686 --> 16:04.611
Free from
all this girly girl pixie crap.

16:04.706 --> 16:05.797
Why would we want that?

16:05.948 --> 16:07.465
And what about
this sweet wand score?

16:07.692 --> 16:10.209
Ugh, come on.
They're just brainwashing you

16:10.361 --> 16:11.861
with their wands
and their twirling

16:11.954 --> 16:15.139
-and their sparkle sprinkles.
-Sparkle sprinkles?! Where?

16:15.366 --> 16:17.308
-No. No sparkle sprinkles.
-Oh.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.885
Wait, you know
what you guys should do?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.145
Throw the wands in the pond.

16:21.297 --> 16:22.647
-What?
-Show them

16:22.798 --> 16:25.057
that they don't get to tell you
that you can't come back

16:25.151 --> 16:27.134
because you don't want
to come back.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.228
Throw the wands in the pond.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.823
Huh.
I mean, it does rhyme.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.883
And an older kid
is telling us to do it.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.735
-Or at least larger?
-Thank you.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.312
Okay. Yeah. Maybe you're right.
And, also, you're perfect,

16:38.406 --> 16:39.980
and I think
I love you more than my mom.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.982
So let's do this.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.984
-Attagirl!
-(growls)

16:44.078 --> 16:45.895
Ugh. We can't find Louise.

16:45.913 --> 16:47.413
We can't find a bathroom.
Dang it, I'm gonna pee.

16:47.565 --> 16:50.157
-Cover me.
-Nobody's peeing here.

16:50.251 --> 16:52.326
That's just a tiny river.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.846
(gasps) There they are.
Wait, what are they doing?

16:55.073 --> 16:56.756
LOUISE:
Wands in the pond on three.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.183
Oh, my God. No!
Uh, stopping midstream.

16:59.335 --> 17:02.245
Okay, sort of stopped.
Louise! No, no!

17:02.263 --> 17:04.397
No wands in ponds!
No wands in ponds!

17:08.586 --> 17:09.843
Louise, stop. You can't throw
the wands in the pond.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.863
-Who are you guys?
-I'm her sister.

17:12.014 --> 17:14.607
And she's my sister.
It's complicated.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.776
-Why is your skirt like that?
-Don't worry about it.

17:16.928 --> 17:19.278
Louise, you're gonna get
all these little kids banned.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.873
That's the point, Tina.
I'm freeing them

17:22.024 --> 17:23.857
from all this girly girl-ness.

17:23.951 --> 17:25.192
Are we doing this?
Are we doing this?

17:25.286 --> 17:26.285
Come on.
(growls)

17:26.379 --> 17:28.437
-I guess?
-No. Little girls,

17:28.439 --> 17:30.381
don't. Uh... Oh, look at me.

17:30.533 --> 17:33.033
-I'm twirling.
-Oh, God. I want to twirl.

17:33.127 --> 17:36.054
-No. Resist the twirl.
-Maybe just a little twirl?

17:36.205 --> 17:39.390
-No.
-Also, what about this split?

17:39.542 --> 17:41.208
Linda? How, uh...

17:41.227 --> 17:43.227
-How you doing in there?
-LINDA: Fine.

17:43.379 --> 17:45.379
How's the restaurant?
Is it fun?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.714
-Uh-huh.
-Bob, let me jump in here.

17:47.809 --> 17:51.794
You know, as a wise man named
Charles Brown famously said,

17:51.813 --> 17:53.571
-good grief.
-Huh? What?

17:53.722 --> 17:56.056
What I'm saying is
I think you need to do

17:56.076 --> 17:57.558
some good grieving right now.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.394
Seems like you never got
to say goodbye to Bottle Cap,

18:00.488 --> 18:01.562
but here's your chance.

18:01.656 --> 18:03.823
For the next, uh,
two and a half minutes.

18:03.975 --> 18:07.310
Say goodbye to the flowers
as if it's the real Bottle Cap?

18:07.328 --> 18:08.902
Seems kind of ridiculous.

18:08.996 --> 18:11.480
-Well, why don't you just try...
-LINDA (crying): Oh, Bottle Cap!

18:11.499 --> 18:12.832
Why did you leave me?

18:12.984 --> 18:16.410
Why? Why?

18:16.487 --> 18:18.579
-Oh, God. So dizzy.
-I feel great.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.947
Okay, how about this?

18:19.949 --> 18:21.490
Just hand over the wands,
nice and easy,

18:21.509 --> 18:23.492
and I'll give 'em back,
and you guys won't be banned.

18:23.586 --> 18:26.753
-Yay. Great plan.
-Tina, I'm helping them.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.106
But they like this stuff,
Louise.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.182
-No, they don't.
-Pretty sure they do.

18:30.335 --> 18:32.276
-But<i> I</i> don't like it.
-So?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.446
Well, why? Why don't I like it?

18:35.598 --> 18:38.449
Why have I never liked
any of this stuff?

18:38.601 --> 18:40.618
-What do you mean?
-I mean... Ugh.

18:40.769 --> 18:42.862
I don't know.
Is something wrong with me?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.456
Am I not being a girl right
or something?

18:45.608 --> 18:47.441
What? Louise, it's fine
that you don't like it.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.201
It doesn't mean
anything's wrong with you.

18:49.354 --> 18:51.445
I mean, you like your stuff,
like your Burobu cards,

18:51.464 --> 18:52.946
and they like
their pixie princess stuff.

18:53.115 --> 18:55.191
Everyone can just like
what they like

18:55.284 --> 18:57.451
and be who they are,
and that's okay.

18:57.528 --> 18:59.378
Really?
Miss I Have to Be Pretty?

18:59.530 --> 19:01.547
-That's your last name?
-PIXIE PRINCESS QUEEN: Freeze,

19:01.699 --> 19:02.807
-pixie wand thieves.
-TINA: Oh, no.

19:02.958 --> 19:03.808
Oh, yeah.

19:04.035 --> 19:05.459
And I'm not scared
of you anymore.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.294
I'm sorry to say
you are all disinvited to...

19:07.388 --> 19:09.814
(gnome voice):
Uh, I did it. Yeah, me,

19:09.965 --> 19:11.965
the gnome's eviler,

19:12.043 --> 19:14.393
nonrhyming cousin, Gnom-a.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.469
-What?
-You are?

19:15.563 --> 19:18.639
Yep. I, uh, tried to put
these pixies

19:18.733 --> 19:19.882
under an evil spell

19:19.901 --> 19:22.051
so they'd throw the wands
in the pond.

19:22.069 --> 19:23.886
I was just gonna ruin things
for them

19:23.905 --> 19:26.146
'cause of, I guess,
my own issues.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.332
But, yeah, they wouldn't do it.

19:28.409 --> 19:30.559
Well, thank you
for your honesty,

19:30.578 --> 19:31.744
cousin Gnom-a.

19:31.896 --> 19:34.730
So she was an undercover
evil gnome all along?

19:34.823 --> 19:37.249
We should have taken her out
while we had the chance.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.994
Uh, anyway,
this one tried to stop me.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.254
-I did?
-Big-time.

19:42.407 --> 19:43.756
You should
probably reinstate her

19:43.850 --> 19:46.075
and have her knighted
or something.

19:46.093 --> 19:47.185
Not sure how this all works.

19:47.336 --> 19:49.261
Well, no pixies left behind.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.247
-I'll consider it.
-What?!

19:51.265 --> 19:53.840
-Yes!
-So, these are yours?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.342
-You know what, I'll take those.
-Yep.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.604
Yep. Cool by me.
So, I got to go.

19:58.756 --> 20:00.364
Bye. Gnome-ing away.

20:00.516 --> 20:01.607
Um, us, too. Bye.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.201
Good luck with your jean jacket!

20:03.428 --> 20:04.927
LINDA:
And I'm sorry
that I bought a hot dog

20:05.020 --> 20:07.613
from that hot dog truck
the very next day.

20:07.765 --> 20:08.948
I love you, Bottle Cap.

20:09.116 --> 20:11.858
I'll see you in heaven.
I know all dogs go there.

20:12.027 --> 20:13.285
Goodbye.

20:13.362 --> 20:15.955
Oh, my God, that feels good.
Is there time

20:16.049 --> 20:17.381
for me to pretend
the flower dog's

20:17.533 --> 20:19.291
my eighth grade teacher
who got hit by a milk truck?

20:19.444 --> 20:21.034
-Good God, Lin.
-Ooh, sorry.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.280
-I got to get going.
-It's fine. She and I
weren't that close.

20:24.298 --> 20:26.465
Oh, now I got to poop
for real. I got to go.

20:26.617 --> 20:29.635
I'm proud of what you did
back there, Louise.

20:29.787 --> 20:32.063
Would this be an appropriate
time to say "you go, girl"?

20:32.290 --> 20:33.231
-Probably not.
-Got it.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.549
-But thanks. And, Tina?
-Yeah?

20:35.643 --> 20:37.476
About this whole
"am I pretty" thing,

20:37.628 --> 20:39.553
which I still think
is stupid, but...

20:39.647 --> 20:42.556
I just want to say
I like looking at you.

20:42.633 --> 20:45.225
I think, you know,
your face holes

20:45.245 --> 20:46.635
are in really good spots.

20:46.654 --> 20:49.247
And if you're not pretty,
then I don't know what is.

20:49.398 --> 20:50.639
Aw. Thanks, Louise.

20:50.658 --> 20:52.750
Anyone have anything nice
to say about my holes?

20:52.901 --> 20:55.311
-They're great.
-They're good. They're good.
-Thank you.

20:55.404 --> 20:57.162
Now, who wants to carry me
like a baby

20:57.315 --> 20:59.164
the rest of the way home?
Fight over it. Go!
