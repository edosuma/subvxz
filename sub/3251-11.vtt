12:19.574 --> 12:21.474
It's our best chance
of finding the girl.

12:21.476 --> 12:24.110
You know it is.

12:24.112 --> 12:25.478
Don't touch a thing.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.981
The TARDIS will get
huffy if you mess.

12:27.983 --> 12:32.385
Keep your radio
contact, all right?

12:32.387 --> 12:33.953
Get back
to the console,

12:33.955 --> 12:35.321
strip it apart.

12:35.323 --> 12:36.389
Okay.
All right?

12:44.232 --> 12:47.834
<i>I want out.</i>

12:47.836 --> 12:49.135
<i>Aaaggghhh!</i>

13:20.534 --> 13:22.535
Now that's just
showing off.

13:48.629 --> 13:49.662
<i>Well, I made up</i>
<i>the name "TARDIS"</i>

13:49.664 --> 13:51.030
<i>from the initials --</i>

13:51.032 --> 13:52.866
<i>Time and Relative</i>
<i>Dimension In Space.</i>

13:52.868 --> 13:54.234
<i>Dimensionally</i>
<i>transcendental.</i>

13:54.236 --> 13:55.602
<i>What's that mean?</i>

13:55.604 --> 13:57.103
<i>That's trans-</i>
<i>dimensional engineering.</i>

13:57.105 --> 13:58.605
<i>It's bigger inside</i>
<i>than out.</i>

13:58.607 --> 14:00.106
<i>The assembled</i>
<i>hordes of Genghis Khan</i>

14:00.108 --> 14:02.242
<i>couldn't get through that door</i>
<i>and, believe me, they've tried.</i>

14:02.244 --> 14:03.743
<i>We are in space!</i>

14:03.745 --> 14:05.745
<i>Box with that</i>
<i>room just rammed in.</i>

14:05.747 --> 14:07.413
<i>That thing that looks</i>
<i>like a police box, standing</i>

14:07.415 --> 14:09.249
<i>in a junkyard, it can move</i>
<i>anywhere in time and space?</i>

14:24.199 --> 14:26.566
<i>Everything.</i>

14:26.568 --> 14:27.800
What? Report.

14:27.802 --> 14:29.702
<i>Everything.</i>
<i>Behind that door.</i>

14:29.704 --> 14:31.938
Everything?

14:31.940 --> 14:33.206
<i>Sensor detects</i>

14:33.208 --> 14:36.376
<i>everything you could</i>
<i>possibly want.</i>

14:44.852 --> 14:46.719
<i>Everything.</i>

14:46.721 --> 14:49.222
I don't understand.
Give me a price tag.

14:49.224 --> 14:50.290
<i>Incalculable.</i>

14:50.292 --> 14:51.691
What?!

14:51.693 --> 14:52.859
<i>More valuable</i>

14:52.861 --> 14:55.495
<i>than the total sum</i>
<i>of any currency.</i>

14:55.497 --> 14:58.064
<i>Living metal,</i>
<i>bespoke engineering.</i>

14:58.066 --> 15:00.133
<i>Whatever machine</i>
<i>you require,</i>

15:00.135 --> 15:02.368
<i>this system</i>
<i>will build it.</i>

15:12.881 --> 15:14.814
No! No no, stop!
Please.

15:14.816 --> 15:16.583
Don't.
Don't touch it.

15:16.585 --> 15:17.584
Please.

15:17.586 --> 15:19.652
She won't let you
touch it.

15:19.654 --> 15:22.055
I can feel a TARDIS
tantrum coming on.

15:22.057 --> 15:24.090
What the hell is
this place?

15:24.092 --> 15:25.892
Architectural
Reconfiguration System.

15:25.894 --> 15:27.594
It reconstructs
particles

15:27.596 --> 15:29.829
according
to your needs.

15:29.831 --> 15:31.197
A machine that
makes machines?

15:31.199 --> 15:33.333
Yes, basically.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.636
What are you doing?

15:36.638 --> 15:38.471
No no no, don't!
Don't!

15:38.473 --> 15:40.373
If you walk out of here with
that circuit, the TARDIS

15:40.375 --> 15:42.208
will try to stop you.
Now, listen to me --

15:42.210 --> 15:44.043
Look, the clock
is ticking.

15:44.045 --> 15:45.545
We must find Clara.

15:51.453 --> 15:53.953
What the...?

15:53.955 --> 15:56.322
Where's the door gone?

15:56.324 --> 15:57.991
Ever see a spaceship
get ugly?

15:57.993 --> 15:59.492
This isn't happening!

15:59.494 --> 16:00.960
She won't
relinquish it.

16:00.962 --> 16:03.396
Her basic
genetic material.

16:03.398 --> 16:05.765
Torch it.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.166
I said,
torch it!

16:07.168 --> 16:10.036
Can't you feel it, <i>Gregor?</i>
<i>The ship's --</i>

16:10.038 --> 16:12.238
the ship's in torment,
like it's a living thing.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.673
You can't hurt it.

16:18.747 --> 16:20.880
What's the matter,
TARDIS,

16:20.882 --> 16:23.282
scared to fight me?

16:49.310 --> 16:51.678
So that's who.

17:27.115 --> 17:28.748
<i>Children...</i>

17:28.750 --> 17:31.351
<i>Time and space.</i>

18:00.715 --> 18:03.683
<i>Why are you here?</i>

18:14.662 --> 18:17.330
It's the same.
It's just the same.

18:17.332 --> 18:20.033
It's diverting us.

18:20.035 --> 18:22.101
Spinning a maze
around us.

18:22.103 --> 18:24.037
We will never
reach Clara in time.

18:25.639 --> 18:27.674
Hey! Hey!

18:31.679 --> 18:34.481
It's just
the same, <i>again.</i>

18:34.483 --> 18:35.849
No point in
building walls.

18:35.851 --> 18:37.784
She'll just know how
to smash them down.

18:37.786 --> 18:39.385
It's found other ways
of controlling you.

18:39.387 --> 18:40.987
Smart bunch,
Time Lords.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.455
No dress sense,
dreadful hats,

18:42.457 --> 18:44.591
but smart.

18:44.593 --> 18:46.926
If you want to get
out of here,

18:46.928 --> 18:49.762
let that circuit go.

18:49.764 --> 18:53.233
It is creating
a labyrinth.

18:53.235 --> 18:55.368
Bram. Bram,
<i>can you hear me?</i>

18:55.370 --> 18:57.637
<i>Bram, the ship is alive.</i>
<i>Get out of there.</i>

18:57.639 --> 18:59.873
Bram, don't touch
anything.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.208
You're just the
sweetest thing, ever.

19:09.350 --> 19:10.950
Oh, thank you.

19:10.952 --> 19:13.453
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

19:16.391 --> 19:18.157
Oh! Mwah!

19:18.159 --> 19:19.592
No.

19:19.594 --> 19:22.362
The door.

19:22.364 --> 19:26.032
Where's the door
gone?! No!

19:26.034 --> 19:28.468
Ugh!
You can't do this!

19:28.470 --> 19:30.570
<i>Bram, you've got</i>
<i>to get out of there, fast.</i>

19:33.475 --> 19:34.974
Argh!

19:52.794 --> 19:54.327
Aaah!

19:54.329 --> 19:56.829
Aaaaah!

19:56.831 --> 19:58.798
Aaaaaaah!

19:58.800 --> 20:01.034
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

20:01.036 --> 20:02.135
Channel's dead.

20:02.137 --> 20:03.503
You've got to
help him.

20:03.505 --> 20:05.305
Gregor,
do something.

20:05.307 --> 20:06.606
<i>Do something!</i>

20:06.608 --> 20:08.341
It's too late!
He's gone.

20:08.343 --> 20:09.842
Let's just worry
about the salvage.

20:09.844 --> 20:11.411
Damn, you care
more about a circuit

20:11.413 --> 20:13.079
than you do about him.
Your concern

20:13.081 --> 20:14.647
for your brother
is really touching.

20:14.649 --> 20:16.215
The android is more cut up
about it than you are.

20:16.217 --> 20:18.551
Now, will you two stop
bickering and listen!

20:18.553 --> 20:20.453
There is something
else down there.

20:26.227 --> 20:27.927
We've got to
get out of here.

20:27.929 --> 20:30.363
Gregor, give it back.
Give it back to her!

20:30.365 --> 20:31.798
What are you doing?!

20:31.800 --> 20:32.966
You're always on the side
of the machines!

20:32.968 --> 20:34.667
Fellas!

20:34.669 --> 20:37.136
Multiple life forms onboard
the TARDIS with us.

20:37.138 --> 20:38.938
I am getting
a massive signal.

20:38.940 --> 20:40.340
Where are they?

20:40.342 --> 20:42.442
Oh, you're not going to
like the answer.

20:42.444 --> 20:44.510
About two steps away.

20:44.512 --> 20:46.613
One step.

20:51.620 --> 20:52.719
Whoa-oa-ah!

20:54.689 --> 20:56.723
Tricky!
Gregor, look out!

20:56.725 --> 20:57.724
Careful!

20:59.628 --> 21:01.728
Gregor? No!

21:01.730 --> 21:03.596
We have to stay
together.

21:03.598 --> 21:06.199
Come on, go!
Tricky, run!

21:08.469 --> 21:10.403
I'm sorry.

21:58.285 --> 22:00.186
Oh, why are you
doing this?!

22:05.647 --> 22:07.172
Back where
we started?

22:07.173 --> 22:08.838
No.

22:09.918 --> 22:12.652
It's an echo.

22:12.654 --> 22:13.813
The console room,

22:13.814 --> 22:15.647
it's the safest place
on the ship.

22:15.649 --> 22:17.349
It can replicate itself
any number of times.

22:17.351 --> 22:18.951
It's trying
to protect us.

22:18.953 --> 22:20.419
<i>Because I tried to give</i>
<i>back the circuit?</i>

22:20.421 --> 22:21.520
Team TARDIS.

22:25.992 --> 22:28.927
Where did --
where did <i>that go?</i>

22:28.929 --> 22:31.230
There's more than
one echo room.

22:31.232 --> 22:33.165
Hey, look, look.

22:34.767 --> 22:36.201
The TARDIS has got
Clara safe.

22:36.203 --> 22:37.669
That was her.
That was her there!

22:37.671 --> 22:40.372
Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

22:40.374 --> 22:41.907
But why
can't we see her?

22:41.909 --> 22:43.509
Well, it's like
a light switch,

22:43.511 --> 22:45.377
two positions,
chu-chu-chu-chu-chu,

22:45.379 --> 22:46.745
flickering at
superinfinite speeds.

22:46.747 --> 22:48.113
We're only together
for a brief second.

22:51.385 --> 22:53.785
Shh.

22:58.292 --> 22:59.825
I can hear her.

23:13.507 --> 23:15.807
Aah!

23:17.878 --> 23:20.279
She's let it in.
She's let it in!

23:34.294 --> 23:36.628
Ah, if I can just
isolate her position,

23:36.630 --> 23:38.730
I can nudge
the alternation,

23:38.732 --> 23:40.799
reach in,
and grab her.

23:45.004 --> 23:47.639
Who are you?

23:48.909 --> 23:50.008
<i>Console room.</i>

23:50.010 --> 23:51.710
<i>Echo imprint</i>
<i>of the original.</i>

23:51.712 --> 23:53.545
You're coming
with me!

23:53.547 --> 23:54.880
I need you to get me
out of here.

23:55.916 --> 23:58.383
<i>Scanning</i>
<i>for female human.</i>

24:06.092 --> 24:08.126
<i>Scanning</i>
<i>for female human.</i>

24:12.132 --> 24:13.532
<i>Unidentified human.</i>

24:13.534 --> 24:14.900
It doesn't know
Lancashire.

24:14.902 --> 24:15.968
What?

24:15.970 --> 24:18.170
It doesn't know sass.
Yes! It's found Clara.

24:18.172 --> 24:19.771
It's found her.
She is right there.

24:19.773 --> 24:22.407
<i>Aaaaaaaaaaah!</i>

24:23.978 --> 24:24.977
<i>Aaah!</i>

24:24.979 --> 24:26.111
Aaah!

24:26.113 --> 24:27.279
Aah! Aah! Aah!

24:27.281 --> 24:28.480
It's okay!
It's okay.

24:28.482 --> 24:29.915
Clara, I'm so,
so sorry.

24:29.917 --> 24:31.717
Sorry. Please, please
forgive me, Clara.

24:31.719 --> 24:32.851
Ugh!
Ow!

24:32.853 --> 24:35.053
Okay, so we're not doing
hugging. I get that now.

24:35.055 --> 24:36.755
What do you keep
in here?

24:36.757 --> 24:38.190
Why have you got
zombie creatures?

24:38.192 --> 24:39.791
Good guys do not have
zombie creatures.

24:39.793 --> 24:41.693
Rule 1, basic
storytelling!

24:41.695 --> 24:43.662
Not in front
of the guests.

24:43.664 --> 24:45.030
Who are they?

24:45.032 --> 24:46.198
Friends.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.733
Well, people who aren't
trying to kill us.

24:47.735 --> 24:49.701
So I don't need
punching again!

24:49.703 --> 24:52.037
All right, all right,
look, a deal's a deal.

24:52.039 --> 24:53.505
You got the girl back. Now,
cancel the self-destruct.

24:53.507 --> 24:54.740
Ah. Ah!

24:54.742 --> 24:56.508
Ha.

24:56.510 --> 24:57.809
You know, I've
got to tell you,

24:57.811 --> 25:00.679
I won't be needing you
in my quiz team.

25:00.681 --> 25:01.880
What?

25:01.882 --> 25:03.949
There is no self-
destruct, hey?

25:03.951 --> 25:05.183
Ha-ha-hey?!

25:05.185 --> 25:07.786
Ha-hey? Had you going,
though, boys, didn't I?

25:07.788 --> 25:09.855
I just wiggled
a few buttons.

25:09.857 --> 25:11.356
Yeah, the old
wiggly-button trick.

25:11.358 --> 25:12.524
And the face. You've
got to do the face.

25:12.526 --> 25:15.727
"Save her,
or we all die."

25:15.729 --> 25:18.130
I thought I rushed it
a bit, but...

25:18.132 --> 25:19.298
So you're telling us
we're safe?

25:19.300 --> 25:20.732
-Ish. Apart from
the monsters

25:20.734 --> 25:22.100
and the TARDIS
reinventing

25:22.102 --> 25:24.102
the architecture
every 5 minutes.

25:24.104 --> 25:26.204
Guys, don't worry.
The countdown's a fake.

25:26.206 --> 25:27.639
Look, just give me
a second.

25:27.641 --> 25:28.974
I'll turn it off.

25:28.976 --> 25:31.643
I only made it <i>look</i>
<i>as though the engine</i>

25:31.645 --> 25:33.245
was actually exploding.

25:34.982 --> 25:37.549
Ah. Okay,
that's not good.

25:39.185 --> 25:40.786
Okay, don't panic.

25:40.788 --> 25:42.254
Or maybe panic.

25:43.589 --> 25:45.757
Ahem. Something
you want to share

25:45.759 --> 25:47.859
with the rest
of us?

25:47.861 --> 25:49.494
It appears the engine
is damaged.

25:49.496 --> 25:51.063
We're in trouble,
Clara.

25:51.065 --> 25:52.297
Proper trouble.

25:52.299 --> 25:54.499
It needs fixing,
or we're toast.

25:54.501 --> 25:55.867
So now would be
a good time to use

25:55.869 --> 25:57.235
that big friendly
button, right?

25:57.237 --> 25:59.504
Yes. Sorry, I should've
had one built in.

25:59.506 --> 26:02.140
Where are we going?
Detour.

26:02.142 --> 26:03.875
The centre
of the TARDIS.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.619
Shh!

26:14.621 --> 26:16.488
Something's
in here.

26:16.490 --> 26:18.857
Those things,
they followed us.

26:18.859 --> 26:20.392
Doctor,
what are they?

26:20.394 --> 26:21.860
What aren't you
telling me?

26:21.862 --> 26:23.995
Trust me --

26:23.997 --> 26:26.264
some things, you
don't want to know.

26:28.402 --> 26:30.068
They're on
the move again.

26:30.070 --> 26:31.136
Run! Move!

26:31.138 --> 26:32.337
<i>Move!</i>

26:40.147 --> 26:42.214
Doctor?!

26:46.819 --> 26:48.253
Doctor!

26:48.255 --> 26:49.788
Oh, again?!

26:59.532 --> 27:00.899
<i>I know</i>
<i>what I said.</i>

27:00.901 --> 27:03.135
<i>I was the one</i>
<i>who said it!</i>

27:03.137 --> 27:05.904
<i>You said it</i>
<i>was looking at you funny.</i>

27:05.906 --> 27:07.939
<i>Now you're</i>
<i>creeping me out.</i>

27:07.941 --> 27:10.142
<i>Please tell me</i>
<i>there is a button</i>

27:10.144 --> 27:11.643
<i>you can press</i>
<i>to fix this!</i>

27:14.647 --> 27:17.516
Oh, thank God.

27:17.518 --> 27:19.317
Doctor?

27:19.319 --> 27:22.254
What's going on?

27:22.256 --> 27:25.223
Say something.

27:25.225 --> 27:27.826
Clara! Stop.

27:27.828 --> 27:29.161
Don't touch it.

27:31.564 --> 27:32.964
There's a rupture
in time

27:32.966 --> 27:35.767
somewhere onboard
this ship, a small tear

27:35.769 --> 27:37.269
in the fabric
of the continuum.

27:37.271 --> 27:38.670
It must've happened
when the TARDIS

27:38.672 --> 27:40.372
was pulled in by
the salvage vessel.

27:40.374 --> 27:41.807
The TARDIS
is leaking.

27:41.809 --> 27:43.041
Leaking what?

27:43.043 --> 27:44.643
The past.
You and me.

27:44.645 --> 27:46.278
Everything we've done.
Everything we've said.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.780
Recent history.

27:48.782 --> 27:50.449
It's not real.

27:50.451 --> 27:53.084
It's a memory.

27:54.588 --> 27:56.388
What about this?

27:56.390 --> 27:58.457
If you give me the option,
I'd say this one's real.

28:06.466 --> 28:08.733
She's right on
to us.

28:08.735 --> 28:09.768
"She"?!

28:09.770 --> 28:12.437
Clara, don't ask me
any more.

28:15.442 --> 28:17.609
<i>Ugh! You're like one</i>
<i>of those guys who can't</i>

28:17.611 --> 28:20.645
<i>go out with a girl unless</i>
<i>his mother approves.</i>

28:20.647 --> 28:22.147
<i>It's important to me</i>
<i>you get along!</i>

28:22.149 --> 28:24.649
<i>I could leave you two</i>
<i>alone together.</i>

28:30.089 --> 28:31.156
What that noise?

28:32.493 --> 28:34.392
We're right under
the primary fuel cells.

28:34.394 --> 28:35.760
So -- so,
so what?

28:35.762 --> 28:39.431
So, so, all the
fuel's spilled out,

28:39.433 --> 28:40.799
so the rods
will be exposed.

28:40.801 --> 28:42.734
It means they'll cool and...
Start to warp.

28:42.736 --> 28:44.569
And start to warp. Maybe even...
No, don't say it.

28:44.571 --> 28:46.638
Mm...
Don't you dare say it.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.608
Maybe even...
Break apart.

28:52.478 --> 28:53.612
Run?

28:53.614 --> 28:56.248
I'm liking how you're thinking.
Yeah.

28:59.452 --> 29:01.086
Aah!

29:03.456 --> 29:05.524
Aaaaah!

29:05.526 --> 29:06.825
Ohh!

29:06.827 --> 29:08.059
Cut it off!
Just cut my arm off!

29:08.061 --> 29:09.661
No!

29:09.663 --> 29:11.263
It's the quickest way
to release me.

29:11.265 --> 29:14.232
No fear, no hate,
<i>no pain.</i>

29:14.234 --> 29:15.767
I can get a new one.

29:15.769 --> 29:17.536
Disposable parts.
Just do it.

29:19.172 --> 29:20.772
It wont hurt me.

29:20.774 --> 29:22.240
Tricky, you don't
understand.

29:22.242 --> 29:24.209
<i>I'm an android.</i>
<i>Cut me!</i>

29:24.211 --> 29:25.644
You made it through!

29:25.646 --> 29:27.045
What's the matter
with you?

29:27.047 --> 29:29.447
Why won't you
cut me?

29:29.449 --> 29:31.082
Ah!

29:31.084 --> 29:33.385
Ooh! Ah! Agh!

29:33.387 --> 29:36.388
Tell him.

29:36.390 --> 29:39.257
Tell me what?

29:39.259 --> 29:40.659
You can't, can you?

29:40.661 --> 29:42.894
You're a coward.
It won't save him,

29:42.896 --> 29:44.796
but you're scared
to tell him why.

29:44.798 --> 29:46.965
What's he
going on about?

29:46.967 --> 29:48.833
Robots don't need blast suits.
They don't need respirators.

29:48.835 --> 29:52.504
They don't get frightened
of monsters in the dark.

29:52.506 --> 29:53.939
What's he
talking about?

29:56.543 --> 29:59.244
Two bionic eyes and
a synthetic voicebox.

29:59.246 --> 30:00.579
But you, my friend,

30:00.581 --> 30:04.015
are human,
flesh and blood.

30:04.017 --> 30:06.518
It was a joke.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.587
What?

30:08.589 --> 30:10.055
It was just
a stupid joke.

30:10.057 --> 30:12.591
We did it to relieve
the boredom.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.859
Well, it was very funny.
They lied to you,

30:14.861 --> 30:16.828
changed your identity,
just to provide

30:16.830 --> 30:18.530
some inflight
entertainment.

30:18.532 --> 30:19.664
I'm sorry.

30:21.634 --> 30:23.602
You're human, Tricky.

30:25.204 --> 30:26.538
Cut the metal.

30:26.540 --> 30:27.839
Cut the metal!

30:27.841 --> 30:30.008
Go!

30:32.913 --> 30:35.013
Aah!

30:35.015 --> 30:36.348
Aaaah!

30:37.549 --> 30:38.950
Where are we?

30:38.952 --> 30:40.852
Power source.

30:40.854 --> 30:42.487
Right, you lot wait here.
I'll check it's safe.

30:42.489 --> 30:44.956
We can only survive for
a minute or two in there.

30:44.958 --> 30:47.358
Um, what happens
if we stay longer?

30:47.360 --> 30:49.427
Our cells
will liquefy

30:49.429 --> 30:51.929
and our skin
will start to burn.

30:51.931 --> 30:53.598
I always feel so good
after we've spoken.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.633
Marvelous.
Keep this door shut.

30:55.635 --> 30:57.168
That will not be
a problem.

31:07.847 --> 31:09.347
Ever pointed that thing
at yourself, Gregor?

31:09.349 --> 31:10.715
What will it see?

31:10.717 --> 31:13.251
What sort of person does
this to another human,

31:13.253 --> 31:14.919
make them believe
they're made of metal?

31:14.921 --> 31:17.889
Who am I?!

31:44.049 --> 31:45.983
My mouthy little
kid brother.

31:45.985 --> 31:47.351
What?

31:47.353 --> 31:48.553
Why don't I
remember?

31:48.555 --> 31:50.922
It was a salvage
accident.

31:50.924 --> 31:52.123
Big explosion.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.892
You lost your sight,
voice, and your memory.

31:54.894 --> 31:57.461
And you --
you thought of a way

31:57.463 --> 31:59.664
you could have
some fun with me?

31:59.666 --> 32:01.999
I just wanted
a brother beside me.

32:02.001 --> 32:04.569
You were always
the smart one, Tricky.

32:04.571 --> 32:07.271
He wanted you
to take over.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.006
He made <i>you</i> captain.

32:09.008 --> 32:11.008
"He"?

32:11.010 --> 32:12.877
Dad.

32:12.879 --> 32:15.947
I don't --
I don't --

32:15.949 --> 32:18.082
I don't
remember him.

32:22.554 --> 32:24.789
You did this to me

32:24.791 --> 32:27.091
just to be captain of a --
of a heap of junk?

32:28.595 --> 32:30.761
Stop!

32:30.763 --> 32:32.196
Tricky.
Listen to me.

32:32.198 --> 32:33.664
Ask yourself why
he couldn't cut you up.

32:33.666 --> 32:35.867
He has just one, tiny scrap
of decency left in him

32:35.869 --> 32:37.301
and you helped him
find that, okay?

32:37.303 --> 32:39.670
Now, you --

32:39.672 --> 32:41.739
don't ever
forget this.

32:46.311 --> 32:48.479
Okay, move,

32:48.481 --> 32:50.648

state of decay.

33:02.795 --> 33:04.929
This way, quickly!

33:21.414 --> 33:22.880
There's no way out!
We're trapped!

33:22.882 --> 33:24.649
You're going to
tell me right now!

33:24.651 --> 33:26.684
If we're going to die here,
you're going to tell me

33:26.686 --> 33:28.119
what they are!
I can't.

33:28.121 --> 33:29.353
Tell me!

33:29.355 --> 33:31.322
What's the use
of secrets now?

33:31.324 --> 33:32.623
Secrets protect us.

33:32.625 --> 33:34.025
Secrets
make us safe.

33:34.027 --> 33:35.826
We're not safe!

again.

What do you mean,

34:44.529 --> 34:47.498
Hang on.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.467
As long as we interrupt
the timeline,

34:49.469 --> 34:50.967
this can't happen!

34:52.704 --> 34:54.839
Don't touch each other,

No, 're still in the TARDIS.

36:19.025 --> 36:20.357
There's
no way across.

36:20.359 --> 36:21.692
No? Okay?
You're right.

36:21.694 --> 36:23.494
So what do we do?
Time for a plan.

36:23.496 --> 36:24.762
Do you have a plan?
Well...

36:24.764 --> 36:26.564
No. No plan.
Sorry.

36:26.566 --> 36:28.632
If you don't have
a plan, we're dead!

36:28.634 --> 36:31.102
Yes, we are.
So just tell me.

36:31.104 --> 36:33.604
Tell you what?
Well, there's no point now.

36:33.606 --> 36:35.106
We're about to die.
Just tell me who you are.

36:35.108 --> 36:37.208
You know who I am.
No, I don't.

36:37.210 --> 36:38.676
I look at you
every single day

36:38.678 --> 36:40.144
and I don't understand
a thing about you.

36:40.146 --> 36:41.712
Why do I keep
running into you?

36:41.714 --> 36:43.547
Doctor, you invited me.
You said --

36:43.549 --> 36:46.117
before that! I met you
at the Dalek Asylum.

36:46.119 --> 36:47.685
There was a girl
in a shipwreck

36:47.687 --> 36:49.625
and she died saving
my life and she was you.

36:49.626 --> 36:50.622
She really wasn't.

36:50.623 --> 36:52.156
Victorian London.
There was a governess

36:52.157 --> 36:53.591
who was really a barmaid
and we fought

36:53.593 --> 36:55.025
the Great Intelligence
together.

36:55.027 --> 36:57.595
She died and it was
my fault and <i>she</i> was <i>you!</i>

36:57.597 --> 36:59.330
You're scaring me.

36:59.332 --> 37:00.431
What are you, eh,
a trick, a trap?

37:00.433 --> 37:02.366
I don't know what
you're talking about!

37:02.368 --> 37:03.567
Oh, hey, oh!

37:03.569 --> 37:05.503
All right.
All right.

37:11.510 --> 37:13.010
You really don't,
do you?

37:13.012 --> 37:14.411
I think I'm more scared
of you right now

37:14.413 --> 37:15.813
than anything else
on that TARDIS.

37:15.815 --> 37:18.115
You're just Clara,
aren't you?

37:18.117 --> 37:20.284
Hey? Ah.

37:22.220 --> 37:25.789
Okay. I don't know what
the hell this is about,

37:25.791 --> 37:27.291
but the hug
is really nice.

37:29.895 --> 37:32.229
We're not going to
die here.

37:32.231 --> 37:34.331

What?

37:37.003 --> 37:38.435
What does a wounded
animal do?

37:38.437 --> 37:39.870
It tries to scare
everyone away.

37:39.872 --> 37:41.305
We're close
to the engine.

frighten us off.

37:44.877 --> 37:46.877
We need to jump.

37:46.879 --> 37:47.978
You're insane.

37:47.980 --> 37:49.813
We'll cross a portal
to the engine.

37:49.815 --> 37:51.882
How can you be so sure?
Well, I can't.

37:51.884 --> 37:53.250
Okay, then, well,
that's watertight.

37:53.252 --> 37:54.618
Hey! Now, Clara, I have
piloted this ship

37:54.620 --> 37:57.121
for over 900 years.
Trust me this one time,

37:57.123 --> 37:58.189
please.

37:58.191 --> 38:01.792
Okay.

38:01.794 --> 38:04.528
Okay. As well as
all the other times.

38:04.530 --> 38:06.263
Ready?

38:06.265 --> 38:08.566
Geronimo.

38:08.568 --> 38:10.701
Whoa-
whoa!

38:10.703 --> 38:12.169
-Oa!

38:19.441 --> 38:23.459
The heart
of the TARDIS.

38:23.460 --> 38:26.361
The engine, it's
already exploded.

38:26.363 --> 38:27.796
It must've been
the collision

38:27.798 --> 38:29.397
with the
salvage ship.

38:29.399 --> 38:33.935
We're not dead.

38:33.937 --> 38:37.205
She wrapped her hands
around the force,

38:37.207 --> 38:38.540
froze it.

38:38.542 --> 38:41.876
So --
so it's safe.

38:41.878 --> 38:44.312
Temporary fix.

38:44.314 --> 38:47.248
Eventually, this whole
place will erupt.

38:47.250 --> 38:50.051
There's no way
I can save her now.

38:55.358 --> 38:58.560
She's just always
been there for me

38:58.562 --> 39:00.261
and taken care of me
and, now, it's my turn

39:00.263 --> 39:01.296
and I don't know
what to do.

39:01.298 --> 39:03.431
I-I-it just --

39:13.409 --> 39:16.811
Oh, Clara.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.280
Oh.

39:19.282 --> 39:22.083
You are beautiful.

39:23.086 --> 39:26.221
Beautiful, fragile
human skin.

39:26.223 --> 39:28.790
Like parchment.
Thank you.

39:28.792 --> 39:30.158
The rift in time,

39:30.160 --> 39:31.526
all the memories
leaking out.

39:31.528 --> 39:32.961
I need to find the
moment we crashed.

39:32.963 --> 39:34.596
I need to find...

39:37.668 --> 39:39.134
The music.

39:42.239 --> 39:43.438
<i>♪ Trancin' like</i>
<i>a cat ♪</i>

39:43.440 --> 39:45.740
<i>♪ on a hot tin shack</i>

39:45.742 --> 39:47.375
The time rift!

39:47.377 --> 39:48.877
Recent past,
possible future.

39:48.879 --> 39:50.979
What are you
going to do?

39:50.981 --> 39:52.647
Rewrite today,
I hope.

39:52.649 --> 39:55.150
I've thrown this
through the rift before.

39:55.152 --> 39:56.785
I need to make sure,
this time.

39:56.787 --> 39:59.387
I'm going to take it
in there myself.

39:59.389 --> 40:00.922
There might be a certain
amount of yelling.

40:00.924 --> 40:02.123
It's going to hurt?

40:02.125 --> 40:03.792
Things that end your
life often do that.

40:03.794 --> 40:04.959
Wait!

40:06.228 --> 40:07.696
All those things
you said,

40:07.698 --> 40:10.498
how we've...met before,
how I died.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.499
Clara,

40:11.501 --> 40:13.001
don't worry.

40:13.003 --> 40:14.669
You'll forget.
Time mends us.

40:14.671 --> 40:16.037
It can mend
anything.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.505
I don't want
to forget.

40:17.507 --> 40:19.274
Not all of it.

40:19.276 --> 40:20.775
The library.

40:20.777 --> 40:22.677
I saw it.

40:22.679 --> 40:24.179
You were mentioned
in a book.

40:24.181 --> 40:28.817
I'm mentioned
in a lot of books.

40:28.819 --> 40:30.318
You call yourself
"Doctor".

40:30.320 --> 40:31.720
Why do you do that?
You have a name.

40:31.722 --> 40:34.522
I've seen it. In one
corner of that tiny --

40:36.525 --> 40:38.359
If I rewrite today,
you won't remember.

40:38.361 --> 40:40.795
You won't go looking

40:40.797 --> 40:42.831
for my name.

40:42.833 --> 40:44.432
We'll still have
secrets?

40:44.434 --> 40:47.669
Ha. It's better
that way.

We haven't got long.
This will reset time.

42:20.163 --> 42:22.697
Hey, Repo, go get me
some food. I'm starving.

42:22.699 --> 42:26.100
Oi, leave him alone.
What's the matter with you?

42:26.102 --> 42:27.869
Maybe I've just got
a little, tiny scrap

42:27.871 --> 42:29.971
of decency.

42:49.892 --> 42:51.726
I feel exhausted.

42:51.728 --> 42:53.161
I feel --
we've had two days

42:53.163 --> 42:55.230
crammed into
the space of one.

42:55.232 --> 42:56.731
Why would you
say that?

42:56.733 --> 42:58.166
I don't know.
I say stuff.

42:58.168 --> 43:00.468
Ignore me.

43:00.470 --> 43:03.872
Do you feel safe?

43:03.874 --> 43:06.341
Of course.

43:06.343 --> 43:08.910
Give me a number
out of 10.

43:08.912 --> 43:12.347
10 being "whoo-hoo!",
1 being...

43:12.349 --> 43:13.448
"Aah!"

43:13.450 --> 43:15.416
You're being weird.

43:15.418 --> 43:17.352
I need to know
if you feel safe.

43:17.354 --> 43:19.988
I need to know
you're not afraid.

43:19.990 --> 43:21.589
Of?

43:21.591 --> 43:22.957
The future.

43:22.959 --> 43:24.459
Running away with
a spaceman in a box --

43:24.461 --> 43:25.960
anything could
happen to you.

43:25.962 --> 43:28.196
That's what
I'm counting on.

43:28.198 --> 43:29.631
Push the button.

43:42.378 --> 43:45.446
We are going
to the north.

43:45.448 --> 43:46.881
Sweetville --

43:46.883 --> 43:48.650
an ideal community
for happy,

43:48.652 --> 43:50.118
prosperous workers.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.253
No one who ever goes
to live there

43:52.255 --> 43:53.955
ever seems
to come out.

43:53.957 --> 43:56.357
I suspect all is not
quite as it seems.

43:56.359 --> 43:58.293
Time for a plan.

43:58.295 --> 43:59.928
You do seem to keep
turning up

43:59.930 --> 44:01.896
like a bad penny,
young man.

44:01.898 --> 44:03.197
"The Crimson Horror",

44:03.199 --> 44:05.166
that's what they're
calling it.

44:05.168 --> 44:07.135
My plans must be
accelerated.

44:07.137 --> 44:08.670
Mrs. Gillyflower --
we've got to stop her.

44:08.672 --> 44:11.272
In the wrong hands,
that venom

44:11.274 --> 44:14.151
could wipe out all
life on this planet.
