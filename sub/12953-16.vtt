00:11.005 --> 00:13.737
I know. I know. I know. I'm simply exhausted.

00:14.016 --> 00:16.541
The engineers' meeting went over by about 2 1/2 hours,

00:16.773 --> 00:18.724
and of course I missed my flight,

00:18.817 --> 00:21.246
but luckily I was able to rebook the same day.

00:21.385 --> 00:22.331
Oh, you know what?

00:22.424 --> 00:24.613
Francis called, and, um,

00:24.939 --> 00:26.793
they want to publish my paper.

00:27.887 --> 00:29.887
I know. I know.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.216
Well, you know, we'll celebrate when I get home.

00:32.634 --> 00:35.206
You know what? I've got to go, sweetheart.

00:35.290 --> 00:36.626
Tell the girls I have a little something for them.

00:36.674 --> 00:39.149
Give them a kiss. All right, love you, too. Bye.

00:58.390 --> 00:59.496
Excuse me.

00:59.772 --> 01:02.628
Place your luggage and shoes on the table, please.

01:02.721 --> 01:04.096
Oh. Me?

01:12.334 --> 01:13.902
- And your shoes.
- Oh.

01:24.526 --> 01:26.285
Oh, it's just for my daughter.

01:32.228 --> 01:34.371
I will need you to follow me, please.

01:34.463 --> 01:36.271
I don't understand. It's just a bear.

01:36.549 --> 01:37.591
This way.

01:39.088 --> 01:42.426
Hang on. Can I have my shoes back, please? Excuse me?

01:43.547 --> 01:47.075
What is going on? Am I not allowed to have a toy?

01:47.916 --> 01:49.531
You know, I'd like some answers out of the two of you.

01:49.624 --> 01:50.571
I'm an american citizen.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.227
Don't worry, Dr. Sinclair.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.323
Hang on a second. The other guy looked at my passport. You didn't.

01:55.461 --> 01:58.034
- How did you know my name?
- Your luggage tag.

01:59.717 --> 02:01.525
Oh, this is great. This is just great.

02:14.210 --> 02:15.298
Thanks for coming.

02:15.437 --> 02:16.574
On the phone you sounded desperate.

02:18.052 --> 02:20.241
For the past month, I've been investigating leads which --

02:20.334 --> 02:21.948
Suggest that your father is still alive.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.034
So? What did you discover?

02:25.390 --> 02:27.531
What I learned is that it was a hoax.

02:27.624 --> 02:30.339
My father was killed by Irina Derevko in 1979.

02:30.524 --> 02:33.096
But someone was trying to make me believe otherwise.

02:34.358 --> 02:38.362
Any idea who may have perpetrated this elaborate conspiracy?

02:39.111 --> 02:40.488
Arvin Sloane.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.055
One of his colleagues confessed.

02:46.067 --> 02:47.873
What possible motive would he have --

02:47.966 --> 02:49.772
To force me into stealing something they wanted.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.914
I mean, come on, Jack, do I really have to explain to you what this is about?

02:53.008 --> 02:54.382
Sloane hasn't reformed.

02:54.662 --> 02:56.756
And he's still after the same things.

02:56.849 --> 02:58.081
There's more, dad.

02:59.110 --> 03:01.733
Vaughn wasn't the only person deceived by Sloane.

03:02.292 --> 03:05.390
The contract, the hit that was put on my life --

03:06.044 --> 03:07.612
I've seen the bank records.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.179
The payments paid to the assassin.

03:10.598 --> 03:11.879
It wasn't mom.

03:12.861 --> 03:14.094
It was Sloane.

03:15.075 --> 03:17.934
He was behind it. He wanted you to kill her.

03:22.362 --> 03:23.451
I'm sorry, dad.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.292
We should notify the agency. Chase --

03:28.385 --> 03:28.809
No.

03:32.507 --> 03:34.408
I'll handle everything.

03:47.842 --> 03:49.217
What do you want?

03:51.603 --> 03:53.315
Just tell me what you want.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.319
Welcome, professor Sinclair.

04:20.863 --> 04:22.096
What's this about, Jack?

04:24.997 --> 04:26.898
You can't imagine

04:26.992 --> 04:28.320
what it felt like

04:29.488 --> 04:32.825
looking into the face of the woman I once shared a life with,

04:32.918 --> 04:35.011
and with a single bullet

04:36.976 --> 04:38.735
ending that life.

04:39.858 --> 04:42.430
I ran through every scenario. Why?

04:43.130 --> 04:45.205
What was the purpose in having me believe

04:45.297 --> 04:49.684
the only way to save my daughter's life was to kill her mother?

04:52.257 --> 04:53.681
And then it occurred to me

04:55.645 --> 04:57.356
why you would go to such lengths.

04:57.682 --> 04:58.771
It was for Sydney.

04:59.707 --> 05:01.991
You imagined you'd drive a wedge

05:02.224 --> 05:03.698
between me and my daughter.

05:03.791 --> 05:05.024
I didn't.

05:05.256 --> 05:07.495
I had nothing to do with Irina's death.

05:10.771 --> 05:18.363
One good reason why I shouldn't do to you what I did to my wife.

05:22.576 --> 05:23.377
Jack,

05:24.265 --> 05:25.356
this doesn't make sense.

05:26.804 --> 05:27.655
Think about it.

05:29.948 --> 05:33.094
Even if I did succeed in undermining your relationship with Sydney --

05:33.188 --> 05:34.897
which, given our agreement,

05:34.990 --> 05:37.035
runs counter to my self-interest --

05:37.315 --> 05:41.321
even then, with all the people in Sydney's life --

05:41.881 --> 05:45.218
Vaughn, Nadia, anyone --

05:45.965 --> 05:48.776
do you really believe that she would turn to me?

05:51.068 --> 05:52.586
Jack, I didn't do this.

05:56.283 --> 05:57.899
Someone is setting me up.

06:03.283 --> 06:04.180
Who are you?

06:07.038 --> 06:10.706
Your questions will all be answered in time.

06:13.328 --> 06:14.369
It's...

06:15.679 --> 06:16.816
what I have,

06:18.779 --> 06:21.254
what we can do together, that matters.

06:28.133 --> 06:32.713
Years ago, I was with the army corps of engineers.

06:32.901 --> 06:36.427
They wanted me to study a certain manuscript.

06:37.784 --> 06:42.650
These pages were drawn over 500 years ago

06:43.446 --> 06:44.725
by a man of genius

06:46.579 --> 06:49.531
who anticipated scientific principles

06:49.672 --> 06:52.846
centuries ahead of his time.

06:56.804 --> 06:59.664
- You're insane.
- Not at all.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.065
Prototypes of his designs

07:04.236 --> 07:05.898
have already been built.

07:06.271 --> 07:07.888
Turned up all over the world.

07:09.525 --> 07:12.555
I've been collecting them for the past 35 years.

07:13.444 --> 07:15.107
I  don't understand. What do I have --

07:15.199 --> 07:20.831
I've been following your career, Dr. Sinclair, since Stanford.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.905
I  need your expertise.

07:29.987 --> 07:33.851
You want me to build a 500-year-old machine?

07:41.572 --> 07:42.663
Okay.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.264
Listen to me.

07:47.135 --> 07:49.420
I know that, um...

07:50.776 --> 07:52.774
we all have beliefs,

07:52.914 --> 07:57.494
and things that we really want and wish to be true and real.

07:57.680 --> 08:02.049
But these specs -- they're just theoretical.

08:02.096 --> 08:04.811
They have absolutely no basis in physical reality.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.732
Once you see...

08:11.574 --> 08:12.997
once you believe...

08:18.005 --> 08:20.290
it'll change everything for you.

08:22.162 --> 08:24.781
And what if I don't cooperate?

08:49.870 --> 08:50.845
You will.

09:36.154 --> 09:37.292
You believe Sloane?

09:37.384 --> 09:38.521
Until proven otherwise, yes.

09:38.613 --> 09:40.515
Until proven otherwise? Didn't you hear what I said?

09:40.748 --> 09:41.982
What the hell did Sloane say to you?

09:42.074 --> 09:44.454
Actually, agent Vaughn, in this country the burden of proof

09:44.548 --> 09:47.167
is on establishing guilt, not innocence.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.781
Roberts -- he's in custody.

09:50.107 --> 09:52.104
He said that Sloane was behind the attacks,

09:52.150 --> 09:53.624
that he worked for Sloane.

09:53.717 --> 09:54.691
You want to put them together?

09:54.783 --> 09:57.450
Assume he makes a positive I.D. you put him face to face with Sloane.

09:57.544 --> 09:58.634
Watch him try to deny that.

09:58.725 --> 09:59.814
You'll have your proof.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.752
Roberts, the man you're about to see is your former employer, Arvin Sloane.

10:09.845 --> 10:12.272
All we need you to do is make a positive I.D.

10:15.408 --> 10:17.215
- Well?
- Huh.

10:17.803 --> 10:18.750
What does that mean?

10:18.842 --> 10:21.845
I mean, that dude is him -- sort of.

10:21.891 --> 10:22.932
Is it him or not?

10:23.072 --> 10:25.308
I mean, yeah, it's him, but then it's not.

10:25.448 --> 10:26.155
Know what I'm saying?

10:26.295 --> 10:29.202
- So it's not him, but --
- But almost him.

10:29.434 --> 10:30.189
This is wild.

10:30.283 --> 10:32.471
Like, they don't even look that much alike, but...

10:33.450 --> 10:35.306
Oh, this is freaky, man.

10:36.384 --> 10:40.489
You ask me, both of them give me the creeps.

10:40.990 --> 10:42.896
Now that I've been exonerated by your informant,

10:42.991 --> 10:45.229
I suggest you find out what it is he really does know.

10:45.324 --> 10:46.939
I'll be in my office.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.348
I believe it's still mine, yes?

10:53.388 --> 10:55.434
Just because Roberts didn't make a positive I.D.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.953
doesn't  mean Sloane's not involved.

11:03.551 --> 11:05.310
Is there a problem?

11:05.638 --> 11:07.444
Yes, actually, there is.

11:09.176 --> 11:10.982
You're missing a vital component.

11:12.337 --> 11:13.284
Am I?

11:14.172 --> 11:15.260
A transformer coil.

11:18.470 --> 11:22.044
Which acts as a containment stabilizer.

11:22.511 --> 11:24.031
Yes, that's right.

11:24.124 --> 11:27.940
Yes, we were hoping to have obtained the coil by now.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.355
Well, then you know that without it,

11:30.447 --> 11:35.314
a device of this size is incapable of withstanding its own power output.

11:35.687 --> 11:36.490
Hmm.

11:54.372 --> 12:00.531
Maggie, I hired you because countless times you've proven yourself capable

12:00.717 --> 12:06.060
of improvising solutions where others have failed.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.292
Well, I thank you for your vote of confidence,

12:12.386 --> 12:14.719
but even I have my limits.

12:16.824 --> 12:17.819
I see.

12:28.863 --> 12:29.857
Motivate her.

12:40.246 --> 12:41.574
I want to believe you,

12:41.715 --> 12:43.521
but it doesn't make any sense --

12:44.205 --> 12:45.868
Why someone would set you up,

12:46.054 --> 12:49.247
pursue the same specific things you've pursued in the past.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.713
So you think that I've resumed my search for Rambaldi.

12:52.854 --> 12:54.038
Have you?

12:54.365 --> 12:56.028
Nadia, I made you a promise.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.491
I gave up my past obsessions for you.

13:05.016 --> 13:08.334
Look, I know I've given you reasons to doubt me.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.340
I know I've acted crazy in the past,

13:13.414 --> 13:18.235
but what happened in Siena, sweetheart...

13:21.592 --> 13:23.980
that won't happen again.

13:26.694 --> 13:27.879
I promise.

13:31.156 --> 13:35.161
What he's asking might not even be possible even with the component.

13:37.736 --> 13:39.877
Please listen to me. I'm begging you.

13:52.326 --> 13:54.610
As you are aware, evidence indicates that someone

13:54.703 --> 13:57.705
has been actively perpetrating crime in my name.

13:58.264 --> 14:01.792
Objective is simple -- find the man. Apprehend him.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.356
Assuming he exists at all.

14:03.449 --> 14:05.493
That's the assumption we're working with.

14:05.587 --> 14:08.349
Our best lead so far is Roberts. Where are we with him?

14:08.442 --> 14:10.104
Roberts has been interrogated.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.294
His knowledge of the organization he was working for is extremely limited.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.341
But we can still use him. He knows their contact protocol.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.099
We give Roberts the coil and put him into play.

14:19.238 --> 14:20.279
He makes an exchange.

14:20.373 --> 14:22.994
We track the coil back to Arvin Clone.

14:24.115 --> 14:25.731
Sorry, that's what we've been calling him.

14:25.824 --> 14:29.207
Yeah, also, uh, Marvin Sloane. Rolling Sloanes.

14:29.299 --> 14:32.301
But obviously equally disrespectful.

14:32.394 --> 14:34.056
Has Roberts agreed to cooperate?

14:34.149 --> 14:36.576
I'm sure we can persuade him to see things our way.

14:36.809 --> 14:37.851
Um, excuse me, sorry,

14:37.944 --> 14:41.854
but we all know that the coil is a key component in the Rambaldi design.

14:42.604 --> 14:43.644
Rambaldi.

14:43.878 --> 14:47.548
Which means that, per your pardon agreement, Mr. Sloane,

14:47.643 --> 14:50.023
you must recuse yourself of all matters Rambaldi.

14:50.116 --> 14:51.683
You have to leave this room.

14:51.777 --> 14:54.923
Marshall, this mission is about proving my innocence.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.586
Sydney, Marcus, talk to Roberts.

14:57.707 --> 15:01.908
Help him to see that it's in his best interest to work with us right away.

15:03.128 --> 15:05.421
You except me to double-cross Sloane?

15:05.514 --> 15:07.799
- He's not Sloane.
- Whoever he is.

15:08.030 --> 15:11.415
You dangle bait in front of a man like that, you lose a hand.

15:13.052 --> 15:15.624
I'm sorry, but, uh, no can do.

15:16.464 --> 15:17.507
Let's be clear.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.549
You play ball with us, or enjoy the rest of your life in prison.

15:20.641 --> 15:22.257
I'll be safer in prison. Trust.

15:22.584 --> 15:25.042
We guarantee immunity from prosecution.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.851
National security crimes, europol records, parking tickets --

15:27.896 --> 15:29.224
you name it, it all disappears.

15:29.364 --> 15:31.600
And we relocate you to someplace safe.

15:33.751 --> 15:35.032
Someplace safe?

15:36.153 --> 15:37.768
What, like Mars?

15:38.049 --> 15:41.528
You'll have full CIA protection. You have our word.

15:44.991 --> 15:47.274
Look, I met the man twice.

15:48.819 --> 15:51.561
I deal with his number two. Cat named Carter.

15:51.657 --> 15:54.848
You think about running a trace, they'll know.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.124
The line's clean.

16:00.945 --> 16:03.709
Please, no! No, please, no!

16:03.989 --> 16:08.377
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

16:13.057 --> 16:15.037
- I'm hanging up.
- No, no, let it ring.

16:15.130 --> 16:16.363
What do you want me to do, leave a message?

16:16.457 --> 16:17.975
We won't get a chance like this again.

16:30.613 --> 16:32.466
- It's Roberts.
- Where have you been?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.203
Well, hello to you, too, Carter.

16:34.530 --> 16:36.575
It's not nice to disappear, Mr. Roberts.

16:36.669 --> 16:39.192
Yeah, well, um, things got a little hot,

16:39.285 --> 16:40.901
so I had to lay low for a whole.

16:40.993 --> 16:42.130
Lay low.

16:42.222 --> 16:45.511
A thing lays, as in you lay a book down.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.401
A person lies.

16:47.541 --> 16:48.727
Oh, okay.

16:49.286 --> 16:51.522
Well, uh, listen. Why don't we get together?

16:51.597 --> 16:53.068
You can give me some grammar lessons,

16:53.161 --> 16:55.397
and I can give you that coil you've been looking for.

16:55.677 --> 16:56.767
You have the coil?

16:58.124 --> 16:59.691
I'm looking right at it.

16:59.782 --> 17:02.737
But considering the considerable risk I've taken to procure it,

17:02.816 --> 17:04.105
the price just went up.

17:04.570 --> 17:06.425
-  Name it.
- 750.

17:07.080 --> 17:08.839
Plus a neutral place to meet.

17:09.074 --> 17:11.501
Plus, no more grammar lessons.

17:12.013 --> 17:14.584
- A neutral location?
- Yeah, that's right.

17:14.723 --> 17:18.298
Or I disappear again, and I take your slinky with me.

17:18.391 --> 17:21.394
You call back in a half hour. I'll have a location.

17:24.952 --> 17:26.232
Might not seem it,

17:27.403 --> 17:29.544
but this could be the luckiest day of your life.

17:33.287 --> 17:35.571
You people better have my back.

17:39.924 --> 17:41.397
- The meet is on.
- Where?

17:41.536 --> 17:44.154
Tomorrow. Around the corner. 1500.

17:47.008 --> 17:48.480
47...

17:52.973 --> 17:54.300
45...

17:56.640 --> 17:57.682
He's innocent.

17:58.617 --> 17:59.754
Maybe.

17:59.987 --> 18:01.412
I know it, Sydney.

18:03.097 --> 18:04.377
I hope you're right.

18:06.483 --> 18:07.572
Do you?

18:10.267 --> 18:11.816
Okay, one more patch, ladies,

18:11.907 --> 18:14.336
and I am tied into the hotel surveillance system.

18:17.002 --> 18:17.996
Perfecto.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.893
Qué bueno, Nadia y Sydney.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.792
All systems up and running. Ready to rock.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.455
Moving into position.

18:25.549 --> 18:27.977
Copy, Dixon. We have you on screen.

18:31.346 --> 18:33.822
Oh, this place is killer. We have to get married here.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.863
You haven't even proposed yet.

18:36.004 --> 18:37.044
They don't know that.

18:37.138 --> 18:38.180
We can tell them that we're thinking about it

18:38.272 --> 18:40.365
and get a free meal off the sampler menu.

18:50.895 --> 18:52.463
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time, please?

18:52.556 --> 18:54.125
Time for me to get the hell out of here.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.405
Just look at your watch and tell me what time it is.

18:57.949 --> 18:58.895
2:55.

18:58.988 --> 19:01.560
When Carter arrives, we'll move in and arrest him.

19:01.701 --> 19:02.933
You have nothing to worry about.

19:03.119 --> 19:05.070
Clearly, you don't know the man.

19:11.248 --> 19:13.485
Yo. Rum cannonball.

19:13.718 --> 19:15.668
A little early for the hard stuff,

19:16.604 --> 19:18.077
don't you think?

19:18.918 --> 19:20.181
No, I don't.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.935
In fact, make it two. One for each hand.

19:23.919 --> 19:25.152
We have an approach.

19:37.369 --> 19:38.793
Do I know you?

19:39.240 --> 19:41.047
I'm just here to make the sweep.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.703
Make  sure you're not carrying any weapons.

19:47.401 --> 19:49.447
Sit tight, Sydney. See where this goes.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.792
- Okay. Come with me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:55.837 --> 19:56.927
The plan was to meet here.

19:57.020 --> 19:59.401
The plan's changed. We're doing this in the penthouse.

20:00.335 --> 20:01.521
Show me.

20:12.662 --> 20:14.756
All teams, re-deploy to cover the penthouse.

20:14.803 --> 20:16.036
Moving to the freight elevator.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.778
Sydney, we need audio on Roberts.

20:21.946 --> 20:22.939
Copy.

20:25.608 --> 20:28.657
You got stones, man. Double-crossing Carter like that?

20:29.077 --> 20:31.696
Sir? Sir, you left this at the bar.

20:33.146 --> 20:34.331
T hanks.

20:36.250 --> 20:36.721
Oh!

20:38.293 --> 20:41.055
So, did Carter come himself, or did he send somebody?

20:41.148 --> 20:44.629
Oh, no, no, no. He wants to do this face to face.

20:50.668 --> 20:52.187
Following them up.

21:21.722 --> 21:25.059
Something's wrong. He's here. The clone.

21:25.152 --> 21:26.767
They're gonna cut the cable.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.319
On my way to the subbasement now.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.638
Roberts is dead.

22:31.245 --> 22:33.151
And the coil is gone.

22:42.542 --> 22:44.060
I need to speak with you.

22:46.352 --> 22:48.636
I saw him at the hotel.

22:48.729 --> 22:51.829
It was only for a moment, but I know now what Roberts was talking about.

22:51.921 --> 22:53.680
The man, the impostor --

22:54.334 --> 22:56.043
everything about him, Sloane.

22:56.136 --> 22:57.560
His clothe his posture,

22:57.699 --> 23:00.491
they way he looked at me -- it's the way you look at me.

23:01.968 --> 23:03.297
And how is that, Sydney?

23:04.511 --> 23:06.939
Let's just say it's equally disturbing.

23:07.032 --> 23:07.691
Yeah.

23:07.786 --> 23:11.025
Well, quite frankly, I'm surprised that you didn't get to it before.

23:11.586 --> 23:12.484
What's that?

23:12.576 --> 23:15.674
You read the report. The operation, the elevator cables.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.037
- Moscow. Four years ago.
- Yeah.

23:19.691 --> 23:22.262
I tasked Julian Sark to a similar strategy

23:22.307 --> 23:26.026
in order to relieve a Mr. Karpachev of a certain item I required.

23:26.119 --> 23:27.782
Why would someone be impersonating you?

23:27.874 --> 23:29.489
It appears to be more than that.

23:29.863 --> 23:33.246
This man -- his strategy, his appearance,

23:33.293 --> 23:36.722
his affinity for all things Rambaldi.

23:37.657 --> 23:40.085
You think he actually believes he's you?

23:41.160 --> 23:44.400
Oh... perhaps Marshall was right.

23:45.662 --> 23:49.046
Perhaps I should recuse myself from any further involvement.

23:49.139 --> 23:50.611
No, you have to stay in it.

23:51.312 --> 23:53.453
In fact, you may need to go deeper.

23:53.874 --> 23:56.589
The coils, the manuscript, your sense of strategy.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.441
If you're right about this, he has access to everything --

23:58.675 --> 24:01.821
CIA files, your psych reports, mission analysis.

24:02.709 --> 24:06.572
You may be the only one who can do it -- anticipate his next move.

24:10.080 --> 24:15.089
You're asking me to go back to Rambaldi?

24:18.037 --> 24:19.318
God help us.

24:21.047 --> 24:21.850
Yes.

24:48.952 --> 24:50.661
Identity confirmed.

26:00.179 --> 26:02.940
I was wrong about your father. I'm sorry.

26:03.128 --> 26:06.128
I know it's been hard to work with Sloane, to trust him.

26:06.221 --> 26:07.118
That's no excuse.

26:07.211 --> 26:08.970
No. You're doing your job.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.391
You don't have to apologize.

26:10.483 --> 26:12.049
Thanks for saying that, but

26:12.170 --> 26:16.653
asking him to go back to the thing that was the cause of so many problems...

26:17.355 --> 26:18.539
What do you mean?

26:19.430 --> 26:22.430
Chase authorized my request to research Rambaldi --

26:22.477 --> 26:23.422
Are you serious?

26:23.514 --> 26:25.130
He's in there with Dixon right now.

26:25.222 --> 26:26.073
Sydney...

26:26.167 --> 26:28.451
- What is it? I thought --
- You don't know what I saw.

26:29.479 --> 26:32.433
Last year when my father and I went back to Siena,

26:32.573 --> 26:35.192
the closer we got to finding this artifact that he wanted,

26:35.285 --> 26:36.901
the more he began to change.

26:37.368 --> 26:39.892
I saw him slipping away from himself.

26:40.547 --> 26:44.312
His passion, this desperation to connect with Rambaldi,

26:44.359 --> 26:46.164
it completely overtook him.

26:47.146 --> 26:48.857
He became a different man.

26:49.324 --> 26:52.088
His eyes were mad, lost.

26:53.398 --> 26:55.204
I didn't want to be around him after that.

26:55.530 --> 26:59.679
The only reason I agreed to come back, to join A.P.O.,

26:59.867 --> 27:04.111
it was because he promised me that part of his life was over.

27:28.918 --> 27:30.294
I know what he's doing.

27:33.992 --> 27:35.798
I know what he's doing.

27:39.821 --> 27:43.014
The man we're looking for is attempting to construct an energy source --

27:43.154 --> 27:46.394
in essence, a massive battery is the simplest way to describe it.

27:46.488 --> 27:48.008
- Where's the power?
- We don't know.

27:48.381 --> 27:50.092
So that's why he needed the transformer coil.

27:50.372 --> 27:51.940
That's right, but in order to use it,

27:52.032 --> 27:54.938
it's necessary to have an engineer with a specialty in nuclear physics.

27:55.714 --> 27:58.524
An advanced knowledge of quantum electrodynamics.

27:58.664 --> 28:00.757
There are only a handful of scientists in the world.

28:00.895 --> 28:02.509
You think one of them is working with our target?

28:02.677 --> 28:04.770
Yes, but not by choice.

28:04.863 --> 28:07.338
Dr. Margaret Sinclair disappeared last week in Krakow.

28:07.430 --> 28:09.571
We can presume this is no coincidence.

28:09.711 --> 28:11.835
Could this battery already be completed?

28:12.535 --> 28:13.386
It's unlikely.

28:13.805 --> 28:17.716
There are other important components, including xanthium 242.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.509
How do we know they don't already have it?

28:20.837 --> 28:23.265
I contacted a former colleague of mine in Sicily.

28:23.871 --> 28:26.298
Someone who trades in illicit chemicals.

28:26.625 --> 28:31.585
Apparently yesterday morning Arvin Sloane placed an order

28:31.678 --> 28:34.059
for an unprecedented amount of xanthium.

28:34.151 --> 28:36.100
I kindly told him to hold the order.

28:37.082 --> 28:40.467
That I would be picking it up personally.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.969
- Someone else can do this.
- No, it's my contact.

28:44.061 --> 28:45.821
Then you should have backup. I'll come with you.

28:46.429 --> 28:48.759
Nadia, it's a meeting. I don't need backup.

28:51.707 --> 28:52.941
Look, sweetheart,

28:54.109 --> 28:55.962
I know what you're concerned about.

28:56.523 --> 28:57.659
Rambaldi.

28:58.641 --> 29:00.639
You have nothing to worry about. I'll be fine.

29:00.731 --> 29:02.443
I think you're asking too much of yourself.

29:02.535 --> 29:05.488
Look, I've proven myself to you, to everyone. I don't have to --

29:05.583 --> 29:07.198
The DSR was a contained environment.

29:07.289 --> 29:08.857
You were being watched. There were limitations.

29:08.950 --> 29:12.240
The only limitation that was necessary when I was at the DSR is you.

29:13.598 --> 29:14.926
When I was studying those manuscripts,

29:15.252 --> 29:17.777
the only thing my thoughts kept returning to was you.

29:18.897 --> 29:22.568
I was surrounded by symbols of all the things I once believed in,

29:22.614 --> 29:23.991
and it all felt meaningless.

29:28.202 --> 29:29.053
Having a daughter,

29:29.612 --> 29:30.320
knowing you

29:30.926 --> 29:36.866
means more to me than anything ever has or ever will.

29:38.312 --> 29:40.034
What about Siena?

29:40.409 --> 29:43.791
I can't change what you witnessed in Siena.

29:44.352 --> 29:49.456
But I can assure you that the man that you saw there no longer exists.

29:52.637 --> 29:53.965
I'm sorry, Nadia.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.508
For what?

29:58.754 --> 30:02.807
Having me as a father is an arduous undertaking, one that I imposed on you.

30:02.900 --> 30:03.942
Don't say that.

30:07.824 --> 30:09.295
I don't want to lose you again.

30:11.822 --> 30:14.154
Then I need to know that you have faith in me.

30:26.183 --> 30:28.705
Considering she doesn't like running on a wet track,

30:29.640 --> 30:31.668
that mare is quite the longshot.

30:31.761 --> 30:33.023
Mr. Sloane.

30:33.209 --> 30:36.066
It's been so long -- in person, I mean.

30:36.160 --> 30:40.595
Well, I've had to take some precautions as of late.

30:41.979 --> 30:43.070
Do you have the package?

30:43.442 --> 30:45.010
Yes. Of course.

30:50.438 --> 30:54.633
There is a question I've been wanting to ask you for the longest time.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.527
Now that you are here...

30:59.381 --> 31:00.614
Yes? What is it?

31:01.127 --> 31:05.132
This OMNIFAM organization you founded,

31:05.224 --> 31:07.844
feeding the world's poor and hungry --

31:08.825 --> 31:11.109
What was that really about?

31:11.202 --> 31:15.400
What was in that food you sent to those impoverished countries?

31:17.223 --> 31:18.599
Ignacio.

31:19.020 --> 31:22.211
I know you were involved with genetic experimentation.

31:22.305 --> 31:26.213
Ignacio, the fact is that someone in the black market is posing as me.

31:27.194 --> 31:29.144
And that same someone

31:29.237 --> 31:33.433
placed all the previous orders of xanthium 242 with you.

31:33.947 --> 31:37.140
Mr. Sloane, he --

31:37.607 --> 31:40.322
he followed all of your protocols.

31:41.209 --> 31:42.346
I didn't know. I swear.

31:42.439 --> 31:44.722
Ignacio, I'm not here to hurt you.

31:45.938 --> 31:48.271
But you need to tell me exactly where

31:48.784 --> 31:51.545
that shipment was supposed to be sent.

31:55.711 --> 31:57.326
Marshall, our team's going to Santiago.

31:57.420 --> 32:00.467
Pull up satellite surveillance. 1500 court of Barrera Montin.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.649
Got it. I'm on it.

32:01.884 --> 32:04.693
Weiss, make sure the jet is on standby.

32:04.786 --> 32:07.930
Coordinate an in-country rendezvous with Sloane at 1200 hours.

32:08.097 --> 32:09.855
1200? Jack, it's me. You can say noon.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.275
Just do it!

32:11.648 --> 32:13.119
Sloane is joining the tactical team?

32:13.213 --> 32:14.494
Considering who we're up against,

32:14.586 --> 32:16.441
and considering our need for Rambaldi information.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.579
And are you considering the man himself?

32:18.765 --> 32:21.575
It's one thing to allow Sloane into the DSR,

32:21.714 --> 32:24.093
but if his impostor has assembled the Rambaldi device

32:24.187 --> 32:26.471
and Sloane is put in front of it, what assurance do we have --

32:26.564 --> 32:28.561
I'm calling the shots here, Marcus.

32:29.496 --> 32:32.783
And you have a problem with my questioning Sloane's motives?

32:32.877 --> 32:36.785
As far as I'm concerned, at this juncture, Sloane's motives are irrelevant.

32:37.064 --> 32:39.635
If he can help bring the impostor to us, I say

32:39.729 --> 32:42.155
let Sloane do what he needs to do.

32:43.446 --> 32:44.582
Go to Santiago.

32:45.611 --> 32:46.987
Let's end this.

33:46.176 --> 33:48.747
Mr. Sloane, the shipment's here.

33:49.681 --> 33:50.294
Good.

33:50.948 --> 33:52.465
Meet them at the loading dock.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.879
See that it's properly handled.

33:55.814 --> 33:58.672
I'll get Dr. Sinclair. We'll meet you at the lab.

34:11.590 --> 34:12.967
Outrigger, do you have visual?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.996
I count seven tangos so far.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.600
Still searching for the hostage.

34:21.739 --> 34:23.480
The xanthium has arrived.

34:23.806 --> 34:25.659
You can begin assembly immediately.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.135
I could have worked more efficiently if you hadn't ruined my hands.

34:29.928 --> 34:32.212
I have faith that you'll find another way.

34:33.333 --> 34:36.909
I've got a twenty on Dr. Sinclair. Northwest side, level 2.

34:37.001 --> 34:39.045
Hangar's on ground floor, east side.

34:39.139 --> 34:39.989
Understood.

34:40.081 --> 34:40.885
All right, we'll split up.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.214
One team retrieve the hostage, the other secures the lab.

34:43.728 --> 34:44.532
I go with Sloane.

34:44.578 --> 34:45.857
I was gonna suggest that myself.

35:07.251 --> 35:08.818
Strange, isn't it?

35:08.911 --> 35:09.905
What's that?

35:10.371 --> 35:12.226
All our years working together,

35:13.115 --> 35:15.207
this is the first time I've been with you in action.

35:15.673 --> 35:17.000
Up close.

35:19.807 --> 35:23.478
Alpha team, you're almost on target. Take the next left.

35:36.581 --> 35:38.051
Watch your fire. They got Sinclair.

35:47.001 --> 35:47.787
It's locked.

35:47.880 --> 35:48.874
Stay back, stay back.

35:50.839 --> 35:51.975
Give me your radio.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.401
Carter, change of plans.

35:57.540 --> 36:01.928
Secure the device from the hangar and meet me by the side exit.

36:07.122 --> 36:08.164
What is this?

36:09.425 --> 36:10.371
This is taking too long.

36:10.464 --> 36:13.417
If this were your facility, what would the access code be?

36:16.459 --> 36:18.123
J-A...

36:20.039 --> 36:21.703
Try "jacquelyn."

36:22.543 --> 36:25.208
J-A-C-Q-U-E-L-Y-N.

36:33.119 --> 36:35.165
Am I supposed to know who that is?

36:47.287 --> 36:49.046
- I'll set the charges.
- No.

36:50.495 --> 36:52.110
No, we don't have to.

37:08.684 --> 37:09.869
We can dismantle it.

37:10.009 --> 37:12.675
No. Sloane.

37:13.282 --> 37:15.901
Sydney, we have to consider the value of this.

37:17.492 --> 37:18.580
I don't care.

37:19.047 --> 37:21.187
Phoenix, we're cut off. They've got Dr. Sinclair.

37:21.607 --> 37:22.983
You've got to intercept them.

37:23.151 --> 37:23.954
Where?

37:24.094 --> 37:25.946
Northwest corridor, headed your way.

37:26.648 --> 37:27.784
Go.

37:29.936 --> 37:31.074
Go.

37:32.665 --> 37:33.515
I'm on it.

38:02.813 --> 38:03.759
Mr. Sloane.

38:05.162 --> 38:07.636
I thought we were supposed to rendezvous on the side entrance.

38:11.286 --> 38:12.040
Hello.

39:07.835 --> 39:08.905
Stay with her.

39:15.316 --> 39:16.932
Who's the man misrepresenting me?

39:18.708 --> 39:21.548
- It's Arvin Sloane.
- I'm Arvin Sloane.

39:24.249 --> 39:25.702
Damn!

39:29.129 --> 39:33.087
Do you know what this is that you're doing?

39:35.099 --> 39:36.169
What the hell do you want?

39:36.263 --> 39:39.360
Do you understand what you're dealing with here, and for what?

39:39.499 --> 39:41.258
Please, he told me -- Mr. Sloane --

39:41.304 --> 39:42.682
Listen to me.

39:43.242 --> 39:45.621
Don't make me tell you again who I am.

39:48.804 --> 39:50.131
You fool.

39:50.644 --> 39:51.542
He told me --

39:52.336 --> 39:53.855
he told me that I could live forever.

39:53.950 --> 39:54.847
No!

39:59.293 --> 40:02.146
Is that what you think this is all about? Immortality?

40:02.379 --> 40:07.899
You bought the rumor, you simple-minded dilettante!

40:13.093 --> 40:13.991
A mystery.

40:14.832 --> 40:19.649
The true secrets of these creations will always

40:19.883 --> 40:24.221
be held back from you, the unworthy!

40:39.573 --> 40:40.469
Nadia.

40:49.878 --> 40:50.774
It's all over.

40:51.757 --> 40:52.845
It's all over, honey.
