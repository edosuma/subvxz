ANNOUNCER: Good morning, Washington, D.C.

00:05.347 --> 00:07.130
It is 6:45 a.m., man,

00:07.173 --> 00:09.695
and a chilly 59 degrees,
so let me warm you up

00:09.739 --> 00:11.695
with a little Jamaica Josh.

00:11.739 --> 00:12.913
[reggae playing]

00:12.956 --> 00:15.826
♪ What's your definition
of love? ♪

00:15.869 --> 00:17.695
♪ Oh, yeah ♪ There's a girl...

00:17.739 --> 00:21.608
♪ What's your
definition of love... ♪

00:21.652 --> 00:23.173
[chuckles]

00:23.217 --> 00:24.652
You got in early.

00:24.695 --> 00:26.826
I was lost all weekend
without my credit cards.

00:26.869 --> 00:29.608
I was just about to cancel them
when I got your text.

00:29.652 --> 00:31.739
Where'd you find
the wallet?
In the copy room.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.478
Found it when I was mopping
behind the shredder.

00:33.521 --> 00:35.521
How the heck did
it get there?

00:35.565 --> 00:37.173
Ah... beats me.

00:37.217 --> 00:39.173
You saved me a fortune.

00:39.217 --> 00:40.739
Couldn't go shopping.

00:40.782 --> 00:43.130
Wish my wife
would lose hers.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.782
Had your coffee yet?

00:44.826 --> 00:47.173
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was thinking--
Come on.

00:47.217 --> 00:48.739
I'm buying.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.043
Any distraction on a
Monday morning's a good one.

01:32.043 --> 01:33.739
McGEE: It was floating in
your gin and tonic?

01:33.782 --> 01:34.956
TONY:
Real eye-opener.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.304
That must've really
freaked you out.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.695
Yeah. Thought I needed
a drink before;

01:38.739 --> 01:40.173
really needed one after.

01:40.217 --> 01:42.782
Now, where's the eyeball now?Ducky has it.

01:44.173 --> 01:45.000
He's not smiling.

01:46.086 --> 01:47.130
When is he?

01:47.173 --> 01:48.695
Special Agent Barrett
and her team

01:48.739 --> 01:50.652
are taking over
the Port-to-Port case.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.304
Her "team"?

01:52.347 --> 01:54.260
BARRETT: Agents Cade and Levin
are finally en route.

01:54.304 --> 01:55.869
I'd appreciate it if you
gave them a warm welcome.

01:55.913 --> 01:57.130
They're top-notch agents.

01:57.173 --> 01:59.652
BARRETT: Maybe you can pick up
a few pointers.

01:59.695 --> 02:01.130
W-What did she mean by that?

02:02.913 --> 02:04.565
What are we
doing, boss?

02:04.608 --> 02:06.391
Dead lieutenant.

02:06.434 --> 02:07.434
GIBBS:
D Ring, Pentagon.

02:08.565 --> 02:10.173
Let's go.

02:18.434 --> 02:19.173
DUCKY:
Well, Mr. Palmer?

02:20.782 --> 02:25.217
Her C-5 and C-6 vertebrae
are shattered.

02:25.260 --> 02:26.782
And?
No visible signs

02:26.826 --> 02:29.739
of bruising
or-or ligatures.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.826
Which suggests?

02:31.869 --> 02:34.304
That her neck
was broken efficiently.

02:34.347 --> 02:38.217
Someone had
martial-arts skills.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.565
Approximate
time of death?

02:42.521 --> 02:44.913
How long was Lieutenant Ross
under your command?

02:44.956 --> 02:46.739
Uh, she came
aboard last summer.

02:46.782 --> 02:48.521
Um, August.

02:48.565 --> 02:50.521
I can't believe something
like this has happened.

02:50.565 --> 02:53.173
In the Pentagon,
for God's sake.

02:53.217 --> 02:55.304
When's the last time
you saw her, Captain?

02:55.347 --> 02:57.043
Friday.

02:57.086 --> 02:58.956
She had taken some personal
time off last week.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.217
Uh... doctor's
appointments.

03:02.260 --> 03:05.130
Said she wanted to come in
this weekend to catch up.

03:05.173 --> 03:06.521
What exactly does
your department do?

03:06.565 --> 03:07.782
Recordkeeping, mostly.

03:07.826 --> 03:09.739
We're part of the
Joint DOD Command Center.

03:09.782 --> 03:12.826
Sensitive stuff,
huh?
Mm, some.

03:12.869 --> 03:15.260
But mostly we handle
routine documents.

03:15.304 --> 03:16.869
Got it.

03:18.869 --> 03:19.739
GIBBS:
Duck, you got a T.O.D.?

03:19.782 --> 03:21.956
DUCKY:
Mr. Palmer?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.217
The lieutenant died between
2:00 and 3:00 Sunday afternoon.

03:24.260 --> 03:27.043
Yesterday?
Mm-hmm.

03:27.086 --> 03:27.956
[phone rings]

03:29.130 --> 03:31.086
Yeah, McGee.

03:31.130 --> 03:34.000
Yeah. On my way.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.173
The Pentagon, boss--

03:40.217 --> 03:42.347
one of the most secure
buildings in the world.

03:42.391 --> 03:45.217
There's several rooms
just like this one,

03:45.260 --> 03:47.043
covering different rings
throughout the building.

03:47.086 --> 03:48.434
Why don't you tell him
how many sides it has, Tim.

03:50.478 --> 03:53.913
McGEE: We pulled this video
from 2:13 Sunday afternoon.

03:55.260 --> 03:56.000
Seems friendly enough.

03:59.652 --> 04:01.956
And then... watch this.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.391
TONY:
Pretty professional.

04:10.826 --> 04:11.434
No question what happened.

04:22.217 --> 04:23.695
Petty Officer Donner.

04:23.739 --> 04:26.000
You ever have a murder case
this easy, boss?

04:43.521 --> 04:45.130
Do you need
something, David?

04:45.173 --> 04:46.304
No, I'm fine.

04:48.260 --> 04:51.086
Well, Lieutenant Ross's
roommate's here.

04:51.130 --> 04:52.913
Being brought to
the conference room.

04:52.956 --> 04:55.565
I'm not sure how I feel
about that woman.

04:55.608 --> 04:56.826
McGEE:
I know what you mean.

04:56.869 --> 04:58.652
She is what my Bubbe David

04:58.695 --> 05:00.478
would, uh,
call a real nidchefet.

05:00.521 --> 05:03.043
I can only guess
what that means.

05:03.086 --> 05:05.217
Loses something
in translation.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.913
TONY: Neither Donner nor his
wife were at the residence.

05:07.956 --> 05:09.086
You put out the BOLO yet?

05:09.130 --> 05:11.000
Yes, Tony.GIBBS:
What'd you find?

05:11.043 --> 05:14.217
Well, both Petty Officer
Donner and Lieutenant Ross

05:14.260 --> 05:15.782
worked in the
same department.

05:15.826 --> 05:19.217
They were both very friendly
and cordial to each other.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.347
None of their coworkers
noticed any animosity.

05:21.391 --> 05:24.913
There is no apparent motive
for him murdering her, Gibbs.

05:24.956 --> 05:27.434
Petty Officer Eric Donner
was formerly attached to

05:27.478 --> 05:29.521
a covert Navy
Special Warfare unit

05:29.565 --> 05:32.478
and trained in
hand-to-hand combat.

05:32.521 --> 05:34.043
But an injury two years
ago sidelined him

05:34.086 --> 05:36.652
to the clerical job he has
now at the Pentagon.

05:36.695 --> 05:38.086
What's she doing with
that geek Steve from I.T.?

05:38.130 --> 05:40.260
I have no idea.

05:40.304 --> 05:42.521
Donner's wife
is named Kelsey.

05:42.565 --> 05:44.434
She's a civilian
security guard

05:44.478 --> 05:48.000
at the Indian Head
Naval Support Facility.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.260
McGEE: Our victim, Lieutenant
Ross, was an Annapolis graduate,

05:50.304 --> 05:52.260
born in Missoula, Montana.

05:52.304 --> 05:54.521
Her parents and a younger
brother still live there.GIBBS: She married?

05:54.565 --> 05:58.565
Single. Shared an apartment
with a roommate in Alexandria.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.695
That roommate's actually here,

05:59.739 --> 06:01.043
being brought
to the conference room.

06:01.086 --> 06:02.739
McGee, take
DiNozzo. Go.

06:02.782 --> 06:04.000
Ziva, you're with me.

06:05.434 --> 06:07.782
[Ziva slaps Tony's back]

06:09.086 --> 06:11.434
We appreciate you
coming in, Miss Park.

06:11.478 --> 06:13.695
Do Lauren's parents know?

06:13.739 --> 06:16.869
Casualty Assistance
Officers are notifying them.

06:16.913 --> 06:18.173
There you go.

06:18.217 --> 06:21.173
When was the last time
you saw her?

06:21.217 --> 06:23.434
Sunday morning.

06:23.478 --> 06:26.043
We had coffee
at Starbucks

06:26.086 --> 06:28.086
before she went
in to the office.

06:28.130 --> 06:29.130
Did you think anything of it

06:29.173 --> 06:30.000
when she didn't come
home last night?

06:33.434 --> 06:36.000
She was seeing someone.

06:36.043 --> 06:40.434
It wasn't unusual for her
to spend the night out.

06:40.478 --> 06:42.521
But she normally called.

06:42.565 --> 06:43.695
Who was she seeing?

06:43.739 --> 06:45.826
We just need
a name.

06:47.347 --> 06:50.782
I guess now,
under the circumstances,

06:50.826 --> 06:51.956
I can tell you.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.956
He's married.

06:55.347 --> 06:57.086
What's his name?

06:57.130 --> 06:59.043
I don't know.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.217
Really.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.826
She felt uncomfortable
talking about it,

07:03.869 --> 07:06.347
and I didn't press.

07:06.391 --> 07:10.173
I...

07:10.217 --> 07:12.782
I knew Lauren.

07:12.826 --> 07:16.043
She'd tell me
when she was ready.

07:16.086 --> 07:20.000
Did she ever mention
a Petty Officer Eric Donner?

07:20.043 --> 07:22.130
I don't think so.

07:28.956 --> 07:30.739
Never seen him.

07:39.434 --> 07:41.434
NCIS?

07:41.478 --> 07:43.217
Special Agents Gibbs
and David.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.826
Got a call you were
looking for me. What's up?

07:45.869 --> 07:46.652
Trying to find
your husband.

07:48.043 --> 07:49.608
Something happen to Eric?

07:49.652 --> 07:51.000
When did you see him last?

07:51.043 --> 07:54.173
Friday morning before
he left for work.

07:54.217 --> 07:56.391
You didn't see him
this weekend?
No.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.565
You do live together?
Yeah.

07:58.608 --> 07:59.913
Everything okay between you?

07:59.956 --> 08:03.434
Yeah. I got a text
from him Friday night

08:03.478 --> 08:04.826
that said
something came up.

08:04.869 --> 08:06.782
And then he said he was
going to call on Sunday,

08:06.826 --> 08:08.782
and... he didn't.

08:08.826 --> 08:10.391
And you
weren't worried.

08:10.434 --> 08:13.434
I'm used to not knowing
where my husband is.

08:13.478 --> 08:15.478
For six years, he was attached

08:15.521 --> 08:17.347
to the
Navy Special Warfare Unit.

08:17.391 --> 08:19.913
Everything he did
was secret.

08:19.956 --> 08:20.956
Black ops.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.130
He was gone a lot,

08:23.173 --> 08:24.913
[helicopter approaching]and he couldn't tell me
anything.

08:32.782 --> 08:35.260
Eric didn't like being tied
to a desk at the Pentagon.

08:35.304 --> 08:38.695
He always wanted to get
back into Spec Ops.

08:38.739 --> 08:41.565
That's what I thought happened
this weekend.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.086
Something went wrong, didn't it?

08:44.130 --> 08:46.826
That's why NCIS
is looking for him?

08:46.869 --> 08:48.217
Your husband is
a person of interest

08:48.260 --> 08:49.521
in the murder of a coworker.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.260
Did he ever mention
Lieutenant Lauren Ross?

08:55.434 --> 08:58.608
Uh...

08:58.652 --> 09:00.826
No...

09:00.869 --> 09:02.739
I don't think so.

09:07.608 --> 09:10.782
I think she knows more
than she's telling us.

09:10.826 --> 09:12.826
Ya think?

09:12.869 --> 09:15.217
Let's stake out her house.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.347
Ho-ho! Hey, McGee.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.000
Looks like one of Barrett's
team must have arrived.

09:20.043 --> 09:20.913
Didn't notice.

09:23.086 --> 09:25.173
You're an investigator;
you're paid to notice.

09:29.608 --> 09:31.000
McGEE: Hey, what are you doing?
Don't mess with their stuff.

09:34.086 --> 09:35.826
Oh, my gosh!

09:35.869 --> 09:37.652
This is "ginormous"!

09:37.695 --> 09:39.565
I haven't seen
anything this big

09:39.608 --> 09:41.217
since John Candy's jockey shorts

09:41.260 --> 09:43.391
in Planes, Trains and
Automobiles.

09:43.434 --> 09:45.086
Tony, take the jacket off.

09:45.130 --> 09:46.608
[chuckles]

09:46.652 --> 09:48.217
You think this guy's
the Hulk or what?

09:48.260 --> 09:51.782
[growling]:
I am an enormous, big dumb oaf.

09:51.826 --> 09:53.391
Tony...
[growls]

09:53.434 --> 09:56.391
The big dumb oaf has
an I.Q. of 160.

09:57.826 --> 10:00.652
You must be DiNozzo.Hi.

10:02.173 --> 10:03.086
I was warned about you.

10:03.130 --> 10:06.391
[muttering]

10:06.434 --> 10:09.260
He doesn't like it
when people wear his hat.Ah.

10:17.956 --> 10:22.043
DUCKY: [grunts] Miss Sciuto is
expanding the DNA search.

10:22.086 --> 10:25.565
All I can tell you now,
Special Agent Barrett,

10:25.608 --> 10:29.347
is that the owner of the
detached orb is male,

10:29.391 --> 10:31.304
had undergone LASIK surgery

10:31.347 --> 10:33.869
and, based on the condition
of the retina, is in his 30s.

10:33.913 --> 10:34.739
BARRETT: All right.
Thank you, Dr. Mallard.

10:34.782 --> 10:36.086
You're welcome.

10:38.260 --> 10:39.782
Very thorough
young lady.

10:39.826 --> 10:41.913
She's just doing her job.

10:41.956 --> 10:44.826
My priority's the murder
of Lieutenant Ross, Duck.

10:44.869 --> 10:47.478
I got a suspect.
I need to wrap it up.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.869
You said you found something?

10:48.913 --> 10:51.043
Uh, I haven't begun
the autopsy yet,

10:51.086 --> 10:53.695
but, uh, I thought
you should know

10:53.739 --> 10:55.782
the lieutenant was
eight to ten weeks pregnant.

11:11.043 --> 11:12.521
TONY:
Salads are not stakeout food.

11:12.565 --> 11:14.173
ZIVA:
Well, they should be.

11:14.217 --> 11:16.782
At least they don't
stink up the car.

11:16.826 --> 11:18.521
Want one?
No!

11:18.565 --> 11:21.565
Your loss.

11:21.608 --> 11:25.695
Did Gibbs say anything to
you about Agent Barrett?

11:25.739 --> 11:27.826
You know, about...
dating?

11:27.869 --> 11:29.739
Nope.

11:31.304 --> 11:33.782
[sighs]

11:33.826 --> 11:35.173
Are you sure he knows?

11:35.217 --> 11:37.869
He's Gibbs.
He knows everything.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.956
He did read her
the riot act, though.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.043
Well, that's
not good, Tony.

11:44.086 --> 11:45.565
I mean, you should
talk to Gibbs.

11:45.608 --> 11:47.217
You and him go way back!

11:47.260 --> 11:49.043
I mean, it's like the big
rhinoceros in the room

11:49.086 --> 11:50.608
that no one wants
to talk about.

11:50.652 --> 11:51.782
Elephant.
Huh?

11:51.826 --> 11:53.695
It's "an elephant
in the room."

11:53.739 --> 11:54.869
It's not a hippopotamus,

11:54.913 --> 11:56.304
it's not a rhinoceros.

11:56.347 --> 11:58.217
It's an elephant.

11:59.304 --> 12:00.217
[sighs]

12:00.260 --> 12:01.652
What about you
and C.I. Ray?

12:03.739 --> 12:06.695
I told you.
It's over.

12:06.739 --> 12:08.173
So you...

12:08.217 --> 12:09.695
haven't talked to him?

12:09.739 --> 12:11.869
Well, I mean...
he left messages,

12:11.913 --> 12:15.913
and texted,
and e-mailed, but...

12:15.956 --> 12:17.260
I have not read them.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.478
Is he still
in Washington?

12:20.521 --> 12:22.521
Wait.

12:27.478 --> 12:28.565
Is that Donner?

12:35.130 --> 12:37.000
TONY:
That is most definitely

12:37.043 --> 12:40.043
not Eric Donner.
Well, then,

12:40.086 --> 12:41.521
who is it?

12:44.565 --> 12:47.043
TONY: Whoever he is,
he's getting a little squeeze

12:47.086 --> 12:48.173
from Mrs. Donner.

12:52.304 --> 12:54.695
All right.

12:54.739 --> 12:56.652
I'm going to download these
pictures, send them to McAbby.

12:56.695 --> 12:59.043
They can run some
facial recognition.

12:59.086 --> 13:00.434
I think it's easier

13:00.478 --> 13:02.043
if I run his license plate.No, this is easier.

13:02.086 --> 13:02.869
No, it's not.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.478
I'll bet you.

13:08.478 --> 13:09.478
[typing furiously]

13:16.913 --> 13:18.695
[Abby sighs]

13:18.739 --> 13:21.000
I hope this doesn't
take too long.Well, it shouldn't.

13:21.043 --> 13:22.652
We're only running the image
against Naval officers.

13:24.913 --> 13:26.173
You in a hurry?

13:26.217 --> 13:27.956
Yeah, sort of.
Um... yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.826
[computer beeping]

13:29.869 --> 13:31.739
Okay, got him.

13:31.782 --> 13:33.913
Commander Nelson Tunney.Great.

13:33.956 --> 13:36.608
[phone ringing]

13:36.652 --> 13:37.695
DiNozzo.

13:37.739 --> 13:39.043
ABBY:
Tony. We got a name.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.608
Yeah, I know.
Commander Nelson Tunney.

13:41.652 --> 13:44.086
If you already knew, then why
did you keep us here so late?

13:44.130 --> 13:47.434
Sorry. Ziva ran
the license plate.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.869
Let me talk to him.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.043
Tony, Tunney was

13:52.086 --> 13:54.043
Petty Officer Donner's
former C.O.

13:54.086 --> 13:56.043
in a Naval Special
Warfare unit.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.695
TONY:
Okay. Good work. Thanks.Yep.

13:58.739 --> 14:00.782
Thought you were going to
meet me in the squad room.

14:00.826 --> 14:01.739
Oh! Hi.

14:01.782 --> 14:03.347
Simon. Hi.

14:03.391 --> 14:05.260
Sorry. No, uh, um,
something came up.

14:05.304 --> 14:07.086
We're still on for tonight?

14:07.130 --> 14:09.130
Yes. Yes,
yes, yes.

14:09.173 --> 14:10.478
Let me just get my coat.

14:14.695 --> 14:16.652
Hey, McGee.

14:16.695 --> 14:19.565
Hey. Cade.

14:23.913 --> 14:25.695
It's been a surreal
experience, Agent Gibbs.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.782
We've made crisis counselors
available to the staff, but...

14:28.826 --> 14:31.000
it has been hard to focus.

14:31.043 --> 14:32.521
I understand.

14:32.565 --> 14:35.130
Have you found
Petty Officer Donner?

14:35.173 --> 14:36.913
No. Not yet.

14:36.956 --> 14:38.478
I still can't believe
there was any problem

14:38.521 --> 14:40.217
between him and
Lieutenant Ross.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.086
We have reason to believe

14:42.130 --> 14:44.695
they were having
a sexual relationship.

14:44.739 --> 14:46.086
You ever see any
evidence of that?

14:46.130 --> 14:47.391
No.

14:47.434 --> 14:49.347
Why would you think so?

14:49.391 --> 14:51.521
We know she was dating
a married man.

14:51.565 --> 14:53.043
You sure?

14:53.086 --> 14:55.217
Yeah.
She was pregnant.

14:55.260 --> 14:59.608
Our M.E. is testing
the fetus' DNA for a match.

14:59.652 --> 15:02.913
Agent Gibbs, um...

15:02.956 --> 15:04.565
[quietly]:
Can I talk...?

15:06.782 --> 15:10.086
Um... Don't bother.
I, um,

15:10.130 --> 15:12.565
I'll save you the time.
I, um...

15:12.608 --> 15:17.652
Look, I am the married man
having the affair with Lauren.

15:17.695 --> 15:19.217
And most likely
the father.

15:25.391 --> 15:26.739
ZIVA: Commander Tunney,
this way, please.

15:26.782 --> 15:29.043
CADE:
Excuse us. Sorry.

15:29.086 --> 15:30.478
Hmm, there you are.

15:30.521 --> 15:31.782
Hm.

15:31.826 --> 15:33.521
[sniffs]

15:33.565 --> 15:35.608
I told you I didn't
like your old cologne.

15:35.652 --> 15:37.173
This one's way worse.

15:37.217 --> 15:38.043
It's not me.
It's the commander.

15:38.086 --> 15:39.826
Oh.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.608
Hey, how late did you
and Ziva work last night?

15:41.652 --> 15:43.478
I gotta get in there.

15:45.043 --> 15:46.478
ZIVA:
Commander,

15:46.521 --> 15:48.304
when was the last time you
saw Petty Officer Donner?

15:48.347 --> 15:49.826
Uh, last week.

15:49.869 --> 15:51.173
Where?

15:51.217 --> 15:52.782
A sports bar on U Street.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.869
I just got back from
a tour of the Middle East.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.521
We got together to catch up.

15:56.565 --> 15:58.043
How was he?

15:58.086 --> 15:59.260
Seemed fine.

15:59.304 --> 16:01.260
Kelsey Donner
thought her husband

16:01.304 --> 16:03.521
might have been on
assignment with your unit.

16:03.565 --> 16:05.521
Yeah, Eric told me
that he was bored

16:05.565 --> 16:06.956
with his clerical
job at the Pentagon,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.565
but trust me, he wasn't
doing anything for Spec War.

16:09.739 --> 16:12.043
Hmm. You're sure?

16:12.086 --> 16:14.086
He was injured a couple years
ago, in an accident.

16:14.130 --> 16:15.652
He had to drop out
of the unit.

16:15.695 --> 16:16.956
He could never
pass the physical.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.043
TONY:
When was the last time

16:19.086 --> 16:20.565
you saw Mrs. Donner,
Commander?

16:23.000 --> 16:26.217
She called yesterday,
after she talked to you guys.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.695
She was pretty upset.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.478
I stopped by last night
to console her.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.086
ABBY:
You're saying something...

16:37.130 --> 16:39.260
What, what, what?

16:39.304 --> 16:40.304
McGEE:
Still messing with that?

16:40.347 --> 16:42.086
Yeah. They're talking,

16:42.130 --> 16:43.739
I just, I can't figure out
what they're saying.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.130
So, how did last night go?

16:49.304 --> 16:50.391
Last night?

16:50.434 --> 16:53.608
Yeah. You and
Special Agent Cade.

16:53.652 --> 16:56.565
Oh, he's... great.

16:56.608 --> 16:58.173
Have you talked to him?

16:58.217 --> 16:59.695
Not really.

16:59.739 --> 17:01.130
Oh, you should.

17:01.173 --> 17:04.043
Simon doesn't know
anyone in Washington.

17:04.086 --> 17:06.913
He's living out of a hotel,
still looking for a place.

17:06.956 --> 17:10.391
Thought I would
show him around.

17:10.434 --> 17:12.565
Maybe I can get

17:12.608 --> 17:17.086
a reflection of her
lips off this mirror here.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.565
So where did you and Simon go?

17:19.608 --> 17:22.565
Oh, we went to
an Indian restaurant,

17:22.608 --> 17:24.739
and he spoke Hindi
with the waiter.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.652
And then we took a cab
to a club in Georgetown.

17:27.695 --> 17:31.347
We had a conversation in
Swahili with the driver.

17:31.391 --> 17:32.565
Oh, so he's a linguist...

17:32.608 --> 17:35.130
Yeah. He's very, very,
very smart.

17:35.173 --> 17:37.739
And, and endearing.

17:37.782 --> 17:40.695
He's a jock, too.
He played football in college.

17:40.739 --> 17:42.173
Where?

17:42.217 --> 17:45.043
Yale.
He's all Ivy League.

17:46.739 --> 17:48.478
Well, I hope you didn't
show him all your tattoos.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.826
You're jealous.

17:54.478 --> 17:55.652
Let me take a look
at this thing.

18:02.260 --> 18:04.260
Their lips are moving,

18:04.304 --> 18:06.217
but it's all distorted
and out of focus.

18:06.260 --> 18:08.695
I'm gonna have
to work on it.

18:10.956 --> 18:14.608
These are Petty Officer Donner's
text and phone records.

18:14.652 --> 18:16.086
His phone's not
transmitting right now.

18:16.130 --> 18:17.347
The last communication
was the text

18:17.391 --> 18:19.043
Donner sent his
wife on Saturday.

18:19.086 --> 18:20.434
GIBBS:
From where?

18:20.478 --> 18:21.608
Cell tower in
Fairfax County.

18:21.652 --> 18:22.434
CADE:
There he is!

18:24.043 --> 18:25.956
About time, man.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.695
Cade.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.173
Hey. I thought you were
going to the hotel first.

18:30.217 --> 18:31.869
LEVIN: Nah, I came
straight from Dulles.

18:31.913 --> 18:34.130
LEVIN: How you doing?BARRETT: Good.

18:35.217 --> 18:36.913
What's that?
Photos.

18:36.956 --> 18:39.478
A British sailor killed in
Singapore. Kinda has some

18:39.521 --> 18:41.826
similarities to the
Port-to-Port case.

18:41.869 --> 18:44.652
It's probably nothing, but
I thought you should see it.

18:44.695 --> 18:46.826
I'll load it up.

18:46.869 --> 18:49.347
Meet the neighbors, Gayne.

18:49.391 --> 18:51.565
Special Agent Gibbs,
DiNozzo and David.

18:51.608 --> 18:52.869
Heard a lot about
you, Gibbs.
How are you?

18:52.913 --> 18:53.826
Hey.
Hey.

18:53.869 --> 18:55.173
Hey.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.043
LEVIN:
Yeah, Gibbs.

18:56.086 --> 18:57.695
Got it loaded.

18:57.739 --> 18:59.347
BARRETT: Oh, put it up
on the big screen.

18:59.391 --> 19:00.695
Like they have a "big screen."

19:06.695 --> 19:09.086
Wow! Jumbotron!

19:09.130 --> 19:10.217
Where'd you get that?

19:10.260 --> 19:12.652
Steve in I.T. hooked me up.

19:12.695 --> 19:14.086
Pretty nice, huh?

19:14.130 --> 19:17.521
Yeah. It's very,
uh, motorized.

19:17.565 --> 19:18.826
It's cool, huh?

19:19.913 --> 19:21.521
Gear up.

19:21.565 --> 19:23.260
Virginia State Police found
Petty Officer Donner. Let's go.

19:23.304 --> 19:25.000
TONY:
Is he talking, boss?

19:25.043 --> 19:26.086
GIBBS:
Nope. He's dead.

19:32.347 --> 19:34.086
GIBBS:
Get the tire tracks.

19:34.130 --> 19:35.521
Duck! Tell me what happened.

19:40.043 --> 19:42.173
I don't think he died
in the accident.

19:42.217 --> 19:44.565
There's no apparent
trauma to the body.

19:44.608 --> 19:47.043
So, what, car drifted
off the road,

19:47.086 --> 19:49.000
came down the embankment?

19:51.565 --> 19:53.086
What's the cause of death?

19:53.130 --> 19:54.260
No idea.

19:54.304 --> 19:55.782
But there is something odd.

19:55.826 --> 19:57.913
He's no longer in rigor.

19:57.956 --> 19:59.304
Meaning what?
DUCKY:
Well, he's been here

19:59.347 --> 20:02.521
long enough so that
he's stiffened,

20:02.565 --> 20:04.043
and then un-stiffened.

20:04.086 --> 20:06.043
JIMMY: You can tell by the
skin slip, discoloration,

20:06.086 --> 20:09.086
marbling-- been
here a while.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.565
How long?

20:10.608 --> 20:11.782
At least four days.

20:11.826 --> 20:13.391
That can't be.

20:13.434 --> 20:15.652
We got video of him
killing Lieutenant Ross

20:15.695 --> 20:16.782
at the Pentagon
two days ago.

20:18.173 --> 20:19.826
Jethro...

20:19.869 --> 20:22.130
this man could not
have been there.

20:32.434 --> 20:35.000
Are you sure he's been
dead four days, Ducky?

20:35.043 --> 20:36.826
At least.
Heart attack.

20:36.869 --> 20:40.260
Myocardial infarction,
to be exact.

20:40.304 --> 20:42.521
Congenital condition,
in his case.

20:42.565 --> 20:45.391
Probably never knew he had it.

20:45.434 --> 20:47.086
It's not reflected
in his medical records.

20:47.130 --> 20:49.043
We sure this
is Eric Donner?

20:49.086 --> 20:52.130
JIMMY: Fingerprints, dental
records, DNA all match.

20:52.173 --> 20:54.782
Burn scars on
his lower extremities,

20:54.826 --> 20:56.260
consistent with
injuries received

20:56.304 --> 20:58.086
in a shipboard fire
two years ago.

20:58.130 --> 21:00.956
Poor man was
hospitalized for weeks.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.434
So you're telling me this guy

21:02.478 --> 21:04.173
couldn't have killed his
co-worker two days ago?

21:04.217 --> 21:05.652
What's more,
I was right.

21:05.695 --> 21:08.478
Donner was dead when
he was put in the car.

21:08.521 --> 21:11.652
The blood-pooling indicated
that the body had been moved.

21:11.695 --> 21:13.478
Sounds like you got
a messy one, Gibbs.

21:13.521 --> 21:15.130
Like I should talk.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.695
I got two dead
bodies down here

21:16.739 --> 21:18.913
and an eyeball.
I'm getting nowhere.

21:18.956 --> 21:20.869
Double-check.
Everything.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.260
I was planning to.

21:22.304 --> 21:24.260
What can we do for
you, Agent Barrett?

21:24.304 --> 21:26.782
I got a thought.

21:26.826 --> 21:29.739
Need a crash course on
the physiology of the eye.

21:31.086 --> 21:32.869
Oh, Mr. Palmer
is your man.

21:32.913 --> 21:37.260
He's been a student of the
subject for most of his life.

21:37.304 --> 21:39.739
My father is a research
ophthalmologist.

21:39.782 --> 21:41.956
Every night at dinner,
he would pontificate

21:42.000 --> 21:43.739
on the wonders of
"the spherical organ."

21:43.782 --> 21:45.434
The eyeball.

21:46.913 --> 21:49.913
First you tell me my
husband killed someone

21:49.956 --> 21:51.695
at the Pentagon on Sunday.

21:51.739 --> 21:54.043
Now you're telling me he died

21:54.086 --> 21:56.043
two days earlier, on Friday?

21:56.086 --> 21:58.391
That's not possible.

22:02.652 --> 22:06.217
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mrs. Donner.

22:06.260 --> 22:08.695
How did Eric die,
Agent Gibbs?

22:08.739 --> 22:10.782
Heart attack.

22:10.826 --> 22:12.695
He's never had
heart problems.

22:12.739 --> 22:15.521
This is crazy.

22:15.565 --> 22:17.304
He-He couldn't have
died on Friday.

22:17.347 --> 22:20.913
I have text messages from him

22:20.956 --> 22:22.782
on Friday night
and Saturday afternoon.

22:22.826 --> 22:25.652
Yeah. Yeah, we're
aware of that.

22:25.695 --> 22:27.608
You have any idea

22:27.652 --> 22:29.217
what he might have been
doing in Fairfax County?

22:29.260 --> 22:31.478
No.

22:31.521 --> 22:33.478
We think its possible
his body was moved.

22:33.521 --> 22:35.086
He had a heart attack,

22:35.130 --> 22:36.739
and his body was moved?

22:36.782 --> 22:38.869
By who?

22:38.913 --> 22:40.521
Maybe by whoever
sent you these texts.

22:41.869 --> 22:43.782
Are you sure

22:43.826 --> 22:47.652
he wasn't working for
his old Special Warfare unit?

22:47.695 --> 22:50.130
Talked to his former C.O.,
Commander Tunney.

22:50.173 --> 22:52.043
No. He wasn't.

22:53.565 --> 22:55.130
They were good friends.

22:57.869 --> 22:59.391
Nelson Tunney risked his life

22:59.434 --> 23:01.217
to save my husband
during a fire.

23:05.956 --> 23:07.565
They stayed in contact.

23:09.565 --> 23:10.826
That's why I thought...

23:17.304 --> 23:18.956
95 percent.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.304
That's as high
as the program will allow.

23:20.347 --> 23:23.565
Then either the program
or Ducky is wrong.

23:23.608 --> 23:25.173
Maybe he has an evil twin.

23:25.217 --> 23:26.565
McGEE:
No siblings.

23:26.608 --> 23:28.521
Tell me what else he did
at the Pentagon on Sunday

23:28.565 --> 23:30.565
beside kill
Lieutenant Ross.

23:30.608 --> 23:32.434
Well, we reviewed
the security video

23:32.478 --> 23:34.391
and followed every
one of Donner's steps.

23:34.434 --> 23:36.217
From getting out of his car

23:36.260 --> 23:37.869
to entering
and leaving the building.

23:37.913 --> 23:39.652
In the process, we found

23:39.695 --> 23:42.391
this surveillance shot of Donner
entering a restricted area

23:42.434 --> 23:44.043
just before his confrontation
with Lauren Ross.

23:44.086 --> 23:45.652
What's behind the door?

23:45.695 --> 23:46.913
McGEE:
Don't know.

23:46.956 --> 23:48.173
There's no surveillance
cameras inside.

23:48.217 --> 23:50.000
Tony's got a call in
to Captain Painter.

23:50.043 --> 23:51.652
What'd he say?

23:51.695 --> 23:53.434
Tony.

23:53.478 --> 23:55.434
Oh...

23:55.478 --> 23:57.260
Ah...

23:57.304 --> 23:59.260
Ah...

23:59.304 --> 24:01.347
Uh...

24:01.391 --> 24:03.260
I have a call in to him.

24:05.304 --> 24:08.043
The room, 3D315,
you're asking about,

24:08.086 --> 24:09.608
is a file room.

24:09.652 --> 24:11.695
Why isn't there video
surveillance in there?

24:11.739 --> 24:13.086
It holds documents
of the highest security level

24:13.130 --> 24:14.695
of the Joint DOD Command.

24:14.739 --> 24:16.652
No photography or recording
devices of any type are allowed.

24:16.695 --> 24:18.304
What kind of documents?

24:18.347 --> 24:20.000
Top Secret orders.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.652
SITREPS of covert ops.

24:21.695 --> 24:22.869
Stuff like that.

24:22.913 --> 24:24.478
Look, you have to understand.

24:24.521 --> 24:26.739
These are hard copies,
documents so sensitive

24:26.782 --> 24:29.652
they're not committed
to electronic databases.

24:29.695 --> 24:32.391
Petty Officer Donner had
clearance to enter the room?

24:32.434 --> 24:34.695
Yes. His I.D. card,
along with a four-digit code

24:34.739 --> 24:36.695
that changed weekly,
allowed access.

24:36.739 --> 24:38.652
Will we be able to determine
what file he accessed?

24:38.695 --> 24:40.478
[chuckles]

24:45.130 --> 24:46.739
Good luck.

24:48.173 --> 24:50.130
You have almost 70 years

24:50.173 --> 24:52.565
and several hundred thousand
files to go through.

25:04.652 --> 25:06.521
Hey.

25:10.652 --> 25:12.260
[jars clatter lightly]

25:13.956 --> 25:15.391
What you working on?

25:16.782 --> 25:18.217
Wood.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.478
What's the occasion?

25:29.565 --> 25:32.434
I thought we could talk.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.260
[liquid pouring]So talk.

25:42.130 --> 25:44.652
You know, I look
up to you, boss.

25:44.695 --> 25:49.260
I've learned a lot from you
over the last ten years.

25:49.304 --> 25:51.739
You've been a
great teacher.

25:51.782 --> 25:53.565
You got a point, DiNozzo?

26:02.086 --> 26:03.565
I've always thought
that the head-slaps

26:03.608 --> 26:05.260
were a sign of affection.

26:07.434 --> 26:10.260
Today, in the squad room,
I was expecting one.

26:10.304 --> 26:12.826
And I didn't...
I didn't get it.

26:17.913 --> 26:19.826
Are you pissed at me?

26:19.869 --> 26:21.869
Rule number 12.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.000
"Never date a coworker."

26:26.217 --> 26:28.782
[chuckling]

26:28.826 --> 26:31.782
Yeah. I know.

26:31.826 --> 26:33.608
She's pretty great, though.

26:35.869 --> 26:37.478
EJ and I have
a lot in common.

26:39.173 --> 26:41.565
She's easy to be
with, you know?

26:41.608 --> 26:44.217
It's nice to have
somebody to talk to...

26:47.652 --> 26:51.478
NCIS doesn't have any
policy against it.

26:51.521 --> 26:53.652
You know, there
are married agents,

26:53.695 --> 26:55.434
and technically,
EJ and I...

26:55.478 --> 26:58.695
well, we don't work together;
we're on separate teams.

26:58.739 --> 27:01.043
My team.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.434
My rules.

27:07.565 --> 27:08.869
[phone rings]

27:11.826 --> 27:12.434
[phone beeps off]

27:16.391 --> 27:18.173
Sleeping with Barrett's
a bad idea.

27:18.217 --> 27:21.000
No offense, but my personal
life is my business.

27:21.043 --> 27:23.043
It's going to affect
your work.
No, it won't.

27:23.086 --> 27:25.956
Already has.I know what you're thinking.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.217
That I've lost focus; that
I've taken my eye off the ball.

27:28.260 --> 27:30.217
I depend on you.

27:32.434 --> 27:34.260
[phone rings]

27:41.000 --> 27:42.869
Must be important.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.130
Yeah, Abbs?

27:51.173 --> 27:53.956
[music blaring]

27:54.000 --> 27:55.869
Abby!

27:55.913 --> 27:57.391
Abbs!

27:57.434 --> 28:00.434
Can you turn the music down?

28:00.478 --> 28:02.130
Geez.

28:02.173 --> 28:03.695
Is that what you
wanted to show me?

28:03.739 --> 28:06.565
No. This is something that
Ducky asked me to analyze,

28:06.608 --> 28:08.130
and it can wait.

28:08.173 --> 28:10.913
I know what Lieutenant Ross
said before she was killed.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.304
How do you know?

28:12.347 --> 28:14.913
Because I read lips.
Did you forget?

28:14.956 --> 28:18.217
Okay, watch carefully.

28:23.652 --> 28:25.565
ABBY:
Hey, Eric.

28:25.608 --> 28:28.695
I didn't expect
to see anyone here today.

28:28.739 --> 28:30.956
[deep voice]:
Uh... hey.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.869
[high voice]:
Uh, what's up?

28:32.913 --> 28:34.260
[deep voice]:
I was just, uh...

28:34.304 --> 28:36.217
catching up
on some work.

28:36.260 --> 28:38.826
Okay. Look at
Lieutenant Ross's face.

28:38.869 --> 28:40.217
Something
is not right.

28:41.652 --> 28:44.304
All right. Check out the
reflection in the mirror.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.478
I enhanced it

28:47.521 --> 28:49.260
and then
I sharpened the image.

28:50.826 --> 28:52.000
[deep voice]:
Where are you going?

28:52.043 --> 28:54.478
[high voice]:
To call security.

28:54.521 --> 28:55.652
You're not Eric.

28:55.695 --> 28:57.043
Who are you?

28:57.086 --> 28:59.260
Gibbs, she knew that guy
wasn't Petty Officer Donner.

29:19.043 --> 29:20.608
You and Gibbs talk?

29:20.652 --> 29:22.434
Uh, tried to.

29:22.478 --> 29:24.826
Didn't go well.

29:24.869 --> 29:26.739
What did he say?
Well, he gave
me a scolding.

29:30.391 --> 29:31.695
It was like talking
to my father.

29:31.739 --> 29:34.695
He told me what
not to do.

29:34.739 --> 29:35.739
Only made me want
to do it more.

29:35.782 --> 29:37.173
Uh-huh.

29:37.217 --> 29:40.608
How did you leave it with him?

29:40.652 --> 29:43.565
I don't know.

29:43.608 --> 29:45.304
Gibbs and I have
hit a rough patch.

29:53.782 --> 29:56.391
Well, you're going
to have to make some choices.

29:58.782 --> 29:59.913
Glad I'm not you.

30:07.043 --> 30:08.652
You on stakeout
again last night?

30:08.695 --> 30:10.043
No.

30:10.086 --> 30:12.913
Two nights in a row.

30:12.956 --> 30:14.173
I thought I'd
hear from you.

30:14.217 --> 30:15.826
There was something
I had to do.

30:15.869 --> 30:17.260
Listen, uh,

30:17.304 --> 30:19.652
we have to
kind of cool it

30:19.695 --> 30:21.391
around the office from now on,
you know what I mean?

30:21.434 --> 30:23.478
You mean around Gibbs.

30:25.304 --> 30:27.521
He intimidates you.

30:29.478 --> 30:32.521
Let's just say he
presents a challenge.

30:32.565 --> 30:35.304
He sees what
he shouldn't see,

30:35.347 --> 30:36.739
hears what he
shouldn't hear.

30:36.782 --> 30:39.304
He's like Alec Baldwin
in The Shadow.

30:39.347 --> 30:41.043
And the Shadow
always knows.

30:41.086 --> 30:43.130
You're scared of him.

30:43.173 --> 30:44.478
Yup.

30:44.521 --> 30:47.478
I'm not.

30:47.521 --> 30:48.782
You should be.

30:57.086 --> 30:58.652
Oh, thank God.

30:58.695 --> 31:00.260
You didn't go
home last night?

31:00.304 --> 31:02.130
Bert and I spent
the night on the floor.

31:02.173 --> 31:05.565
Well, you two
both sound excited.

31:05.608 --> 31:08.913
Yes. Last night, I examined
Petty Officer Donner's body

31:08.956 --> 31:10.565
once more, hoping
I'd missed something.

31:10.608 --> 31:12.130
And I had.

31:12.173 --> 31:15.869
Inside his external auditory
meatus-- his ear canal--

31:15.913 --> 31:18.217
I found traces of a
foreign substance.

31:18.260 --> 31:20.173
Major Mass Spec and I
identified it

31:20.217 --> 31:21.695
as calcium alginate powder.

31:21.739 --> 31:24.260
It's a fast-curing medium
used for making molds.

31:24.304 --> 31:26.217
Dentists make impressions
of the mouth with it.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.652
It's also perfect for
making single-use molds

31:28.695 --> 31:32.652
of body parts--
hands, feet, faces...

31:32.695 --> 31:35.173
We think someone made
a life cast

31:35.217 --> 31:37.869
of Petty Officer Donner's face.

31:37.913 --> 31:39.000
We're sure that's not Donner.

31:39.043 --> 31:40.652
But whoever it is,

31:40.695 --> 31:42.782
they copied Donner's face,

31:42.826 --> 31:45.130
but they couldn't
copy his voice.

31:45.173 --> 31:47.173
These things are
incredibly realistic,

31:47.217 --> 31:48.826
and really hard to make.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.130
ZIVA:
A mask?

31:54.173 --> 31:55.347
TONY:
I love it.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.565
right out
of Mission: Impossible III.

31:56.608 --> 31:59.478
You know? Where Cruise
pulls off the mask

31:59.521 --> 32:01.956
to reveal the
evil Dougray Scott.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.173
That was M:I-2,
DiNozzo.

32:03.217 --> 32:05.391
I'm sorry.
I know my movies.

32:05.434 --> 32:07.043
M:I-3.
Directed by John Woo.

32:07.086 --> 32:09.304
You're right about Woo.
But it was M:I-2.

32:09.347 --> 32:11.956
I was on set, standing next
to him when he shot the scene.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.869
You're right.

32:13.913 --> 32:14.869
Did you meet Tom Cruise?

32:14.913 --> 32:16.043
Yeah. Nice guy.

32:16.086 --> 32:18.304
Well, that was a movie.
This is real life.

32:18.347 --> 32:19.565
So was that 20-year-old

32:19.608 --> 32:22.043
Chinese kid
seeking asylum last October.

32:22.086 --> 32:23.739
He got through Customs.

32:23.782 --> 32:25.043
He got on a plane in Hong Kong

32:25.086 --> 32:26.478
wearing a mask
that made him look

32:26.521 --> 32:28.565
like a 90-year-old
Caucasian man.

32:28.608 --> 32:31.565
Yeah. He bought it on line
for something like $1,200.

32:31.608 --> 32:35.086
Boss, the CIA's Office
of Technical Services

32:35.130 --> 32:37.826
has an arm that creates and
utilizes realistic disguises,

32:37.869 --> 32:40.304
including silicone masks.

32:40.347 --> 32:41.695
Donner was attached to

32:41.739 --> 32:43.086
Commander Tunney's
Spec Op Warfare unit.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.478
They do covert ops.

32:45.521 --> 32:47.391
Maybe they have
a similar division.

32:48.782 --> 32:50.434
Aren't you guys already
investigating Tunney?

32:50.478 --> 32:52.739
I saw you bringing him in to
the conference room yesterday.

32:52.782 --> 32:53.782
ZIVA:
You know Tunney?

32:53.826 --> 32:55.347
No.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.391
His picture was in a file
that I glanced at.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.913
He and his Spec War unit are

32:58.956 --> 33:00.173
under investigation
for the murder

33:00.217 --> 33:02.043
of a local tribal leader
killed in Afghanistan.

33:02.086 --> 33:05.608
Tunney denied he was ever
in the area where it occurred.

33:05.652 --> 33:06.826
You remembered the face?

33:06.869 --> 33:08.869
Special Agent Cade
has a photographic memory.

33:08.913 --> 33:10.173
Of course he does.

33:11.260 --> 33:12.608
Cade, thanks.

33:12.652 --> 33:14.521
DiNozzo, McGee, find out

33:14.565 --> 33:16.521
if Spec War uses masks.

33:16.565 --> 33:18.608
Ziva, come on.
You're with me.

33:18.652 --> 33:20.217
You're gonna
go find Tunney.

33:20.260 --> 33:23.652
Did Abby say anything to you
about Special Agent Cade?

33:23.695 --> 33:24.826
The Hulk? No.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.347
I think
she's fascinated by him.

33:26.391 --> 33:27.739
I know what's going on

33:27.782 --> 33:30.000
in that paranoid little
brain of yours, Timmy.

33:30.043 --> 33:31.913
You're not the smartest
kid in the class anymore,

33:31.956 --> 33:33.043
and you don't like it.

33:33.086 --> 33:34.695
No, it's not that.

33:34.739 --> 33:38.043
It's just, I enjoyed it more
when it was just us.

33:38.086 --> 33:40.739
Doesn't it bother you,
having Barrett's team around?

33:40.782 --> 33:42.826
My life was a lot simpler
before she got here.

33:42.869 --> 33:44.434
How so?

33:44.478 --> 33:47.043
Well, Gibbs is giving me
grief about sleeping with her.

33:47.086 --> 33:49.043
You're sleeping
with Special Agent Barrett?

33:49.086 --> 33:50.478
Catch up, Tim.

33:50.521 --> 33:52.391
Whole Navy Yard
knows about it.

33:54.217 --> 33:56.000
[sighs]

34:03.304 --> 34:06.260
[beeping]

34:12.608 --> 34:15.217
You the guys from NCIS?

34:15.260 --> 34:17.739
Special Agents
DiNozzo and McGee.

34:17.782 --> 34:20.130
We're looking
for Miles Hogan.

34:20.173 --> 34:22.434
Hold your creds up!

34:26.217 --> 34:27.695
Thank you.

34:30.565 --> 34:32.173
[laughing]:
Hey.

34:32.217 --> 34:33.260
[laughing]:
Hey. Miles?

34:33.304 --> 34:34.652
Yeah.
Right.

34:34.695 --> 34:37.043
I've never seen guys
get cleared so fast.

34:37.086 --> 34:39.869
Normally it takes, like, a poly
and a two-week background check.

34:39.913 --> 34:43.043
Well, we are federal agents
investigating a murder

34:43.086 --> 34:44.217
at the Pentagon, Miles.

34:44.260 --> 34:47.260
[laughing]:
Yeah, right.

34:47.304 --> 34:49.260
I was told to give you
my full cooperation.

34:49.304 --> 34:51.652
Here you go.
Thanks.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.826
McGEE:
Wow.

34:58.782 --> 35:00.782
We were going to ask

35:00.826 --> 35:03.434
if you had the capability
of making a mask, but

35:03.478 --> 35:04.391
guess we have
our answer.

35:04.434 --> 35:06.260
TONY:
That is so realistic.

35:06.304 --> 35:07.739
Wow.

35:07.782 --> 35:09.043
Can I ask you a question?

35:09.086 --> 35:11.304
This mask bears
an uncanny resemblance

35:11.347 --> 35:14.652
to the master of suspense
himself.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.217
Is this Alfred Hitchcock?

35:16.260 --> 35:17.478
[laughs]

35:17.521 --> 35:19.000
I call this one The Mole.

35:19.043 --> 35:21.782
He's made of
super-thin silicone

35:21.826 --> 35:23.347
that looks and feels

35:23.391 --> 35:25.043
real right down
to the pores.

35:25.086 --> 35:26.913
Uh, I'd rather
that you...
Okay.

35:26.956 --> 35:28.347
Look on the
inside. Feel this.

35:28.391 --> 35:29.739
It's smooth, huh?

35:29.782 --> 35:31.652
It stretches
over the wearer's face.

35:31.695 --> 35:33.304
It moves
with the facial muscles.

35:33.347 --> 35:35.043
Stroke the, uh...
stroke the hair.

35:35.086 --> 35:36.913
Each one of these

35:36.956 --> 35:39.130
is individually punched.

35:39.173 --> 35:41.086
McGEE:
Mr. Hogan,

35:41.130 --> 35:42.521
we believe this man
is wearing a mask.

35:48.304 --> 35:51.217
[laughs]

35:51.260 --> 35:53.260
Okay. This a joke.

35:53.304 --> 35:55.000
No.

35:55.043 --> 35:56.913
Wow.

35:56.956 --> 35:59.130
[laughing]:
Come here for a second.

36:01.913 --> 36:04.260
This is the positive
I made the mask from.

36:04.304 --> 36:05.869
It was a rush job.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.130
I worked 36 straight hours
on this last weekend.

36:08.173 --> 36:09.434
Thank God
for Caf-POW!

36:09.478 --> 36:11.000
[chuckles]

36:11.043 --> 36:13.000
You admit that
you made the mask?

36:13.043 --> 36:15.826
Yeah. It's what I do here.

36:15.869 --> 36:19.304
Petty Officer Donner had a mask
made of himself?

36:19.347 --> 36:20.260
No. He was dead.

36:20.304 --> 36:22.000
You made a mask of a dead guy?

36:22.043 --> 36:24.086
Yeah.

36:24.130 --> 36:27.130
You don't find that
a little strange?

36:27.173 --> 36:30.608
A lot of what I do
around here is strange.

36:30.652 --> 36:33.043
You didn't tell
anyone what you did?

36:33.086 --> 36:35.043
I work in one of the most

36:35.086 --> 36:37.173
clandestine divisions

36:37.217 --> 36:40.478
of one of the most clandestine
agencies in the world.

36:40.521 --> 36:42.217
I tell anyone what I do,

36:42.260 --> 36:45.304
I can go to Leavenworth
for the rest of my life.

36:45.347 --> 36:48.043
And if I get a call from
upstairs, I do what I'm told.

36:50.652 --> 36:52.608
Who called?

36:52.652 --> 36:53.826
Commander Tunney.

36:53.869 --> 36:55.782
He heads up one
of our units.

36:55.826 --> 36:58.173
I made the mold of Donner
at Tunney's apartment.

36:58.217 --> 37:01.000
They told me that there was
an undercover sting,

37:01.043 --> 37:02.608
and then,
Donner had a heart attack

37:02.652 --> 37:04.173
on Friday and died,

37:04.217 --> 37:06.913
and if he didn't show up
at a drop on Sunday,

37:06.956 --> 37:09.086
then, a year and a half
of undercover investigation

37:09.130 --> 37:11.086
would have been,
you know, wasted.

37:11.130 --> 37:13.695
Commander Tunney was gonna wear
the mask and make the drop?

37:13.739 --> 37:16.434
Do you know where
the commander is now?No, I haven't

37:16.478 --> 37:18.652
seen him since I gave him
the mask Sunday morning.

37:18.695 --> 37:21.173
Thank you, Miles.

37:21.217 --> 37:22.391
Yeah.

37:22.434 --> 37:23.695
Yeah. Gibbs.

37:23.739 --> 37:26.956
Boss, Commander Tunney
was wearing the mask.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.173
Oh, he wasn't
at his apartment.

37:28.217 --> 37:29.608
We tracked him
to Indian Head.

37:29.652 --> 37:30.826
We're almost at the base.

37:30.869 --> 37:32.173
We're still in his building.

37:32.217 --> 37:33.695
We'll check his office upstairs.

37:33.739 --> 37:35.000
All right, we'll meet you there.

37:35.043 --> 37:36.391
[engine revs, tires squeal]

37:36.434 --> 37:38.173
So, Commander Tunney got

37:38.217 --> 37:40.173
into the Pentagon's parking lot
with Donner's car.

37:40.217 --> 37:42.695
Then he used Donner's
clearance and face

37:42.739 --> 37:45.347
to gain access
to the restricted file room.

37:45.391 --> 37:48.043
I mean, what's so important
to go through all that trouble?

37:48.086 --> 37:50.913
What do you think Miles would
charge to make a mask of Gibbs?

37:50.956 --> 37:52.086
I wouldn't go there.

37:52.130 --> 37:53.913
You're in enough trouble
with him already.

38:02.043 --> 38:04.000
[sniffing]

38:04.043 --> 38:05.173
You smell that?

38:05.217 --> 38:06.217
What?

38:06.260 --> 38:07.565
Cologne.

38:08.826 --> 38:10.956
[bell rings]It's Tunney's!

38:11.000 --> 38:12.956
[tires squeal]

38:23.565 --> 38:24.913
Boss, the old man!

38:24.956 --> 38:26.000
McGEE:
It's Tunney.

38:30.304 --> 38:32.043
Go.

38:35.608 --> 38:37.043
You go to the left.

39:14.043 --> 39:15.478
[groans]

39:16.565 --> 39:17.652
[both grunting]

39:29.260 --> 39:31.043
Give me an excuse.

39:38.608 --> 39:40.826
You think you would've
got through Customs
with that disguise?

39:40.869 --> 39:43.173
I have before.

39:43.217 --> 39:46.000
We can place you in the Pentagon
wearing the Donner mask.

39:46.043 --> 39:47.913
GIBBS:
Got you cold

39:47.956 --> 39:50.130
for the death of
Lieutenant Lauren Ross.

39:50.173 --> 39:52.130
We know about the covert op
in Kandahar.

39:52.173 --> 39:53.173
Things get out of hand?

39:54.608 --> 39:56.826
GIBBS:
You're being
investigated

39:56.869 --> 39:59.043
for the death
of a tribal leader.

39:59.086 --> 40:01.478
You denied being in the area.

40:01.521 --> 40:03.565
You lied, Commander.

40:03.608 --> 40:05.739
TONY: It was easy to narrow down
what we were looking for

40:05.782 --> 40:07.913
in the Command Center file room,
once we knew it was you.

40:09.695 --> 40:11.521
This op report places you

40:11.565 --> 40:13.739
100 miles from the village
the night

40:13.782 --> 40:16.130
the tribal leader
was killed.

40:16.173 --> 40:18.000
It's got your
fingerprints all over it.

40:18.043 --> 40:19.956
I wrote it.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
Yeah, but problem is, there are
no other prints on the report.

40:23.043 --> 40:25.043
Not your C.O., who
supposedly read it,

40:25.086 --> 40:28.000
or a clerk who would
have filed the report.

40:28.043 --> 40:32.608
You substituted this
report for the original,

40:32.652 --> 40:35.043
the one that would have
placed you in the village.

40:35.086 --> 40:37.391
TONY: Donner was going
to make the switch

40:37.434 --> 40:43.043
because you saved his life,
but he had a heart attack, so,

40:43.086 --> 40:45.043
you had to go in,

40:45.086 --> 40:47.739
wearing the Donner mask.

40:47.782 --> 40:49.826
GIBBS: This was all
about a cover-up?

40:49.869 --> 40:53.173
Your own words
were going to hang you.

40:58.695 --> 41:00.304
I was protecting my unit.

41:02.086 --> 41:04.391
We were doing our jobs.

41:04.434 --> 41:07.260
It's a dirty job
no one else wants to do.

41:08.826 --> 41:10.304
Brass needs intel.

41:10.347 --> 41:12.043
No one cares how we get it
until something goes wrong.

41:12.086 --> 41:14.826
Tribal leader got killed.

41:14.869 --> 41:16.956
Things happen.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.173
Sometimes
there's collateral damage.

41:20.826 --> 41:24.043
Yeah.

41:24.086 --> 41:26.521
Like Lieutenant Lauren Ross.

41:31.913 --> 41:34.347
Interesting theory.
Highly unlikely.

41:34.391 --> 41:35.652
Let's give it a shot.

41:35.695 --> 41:36.695
Mm-hmm.

41:38.521 --> 41:41.521
What's the Autopsy Gremlin
up to, hmm?

41:44.478 --> 41:46.608
JIMMY:
All righty, here we go.

41:48.608 --> 41:50.739
You want the honor,
Special Agent Barrett?

41:52.434 --> 41:53.826
No. You do it.
