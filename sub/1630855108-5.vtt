01:57.826 --> 01:59.577
Are the kids awake?

02:00.829 --> 02:03.581
Are the kids awake?
Candy, it's 6:30 in the morning.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.544
Are you alright?

02:08.962 --> 02:10.129
Yeah, why wouldn't I be alright?

02:12.799 --> 02:14.926
<i>Did Mrs. Montgomery ever mention
getting a divorce?</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:17.929
She mentioned it once.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.139
She said

02:21.140 --> 02:23.685
maybe when her kids were grown,
that she still had

02:23.685 --> 02:25.770
a life to lead and--

02:25.770 --> 02:28.064
- A life to lead with you?
- No.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.818
No, that was never--

02:31.818 --> 02:33.152
We never contemplated a future.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.781
I loved Betty, and Candy knew that.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.534
Did your wife ever find out
you were having an affair?

02:41.369 --> 02:44.289
If she did, she never let on.
I don't think so.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.209
Did you kill your wife?

02:49.335 --> 02:50.712
No.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.088
Do you know who did?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.426
No.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.554
Mr. Gore, at this time, we're gonna have

02:59.554 --> 03:01.890
to read you your legal rights
as prescribed by law.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.892
You have the right to remain silent.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.144
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

03:06.144 --> 03:08.438
in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.857
If you can't afford one,
one will be provided to you.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.110
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you?

03:37.800 --> 03:38.801
Hello?

03:39.344 --> 03:40.511
<i>Mrs. Montgomery?</i>

03:40.511 --> 03:42.096
Yeah, Chief Abbott here.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.225
- Oh, hi.
- <i>Sorry to bother you at home.</i>

03:46.225 --> 03:47.518
<i>Listen,</i>

03:47.518 --> 03:50.188
we had a couple more questions
and so forth.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.857
Wondering if you could just
pop back in here

03:52.857 --> 03:54.859
if it's not too much of an imposition.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.654
It's just routine.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.866
We need to take your prints,
so we can screen out the prints

04:01.866 --> 04:04.994
of family and friends
who were in the house that day.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.079
Okay.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.375
Sure are a lot of folks here today.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.876
Yes, ma'am.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.511
So, you made mention of

04:21.511 --> 04:22.845
a "Marriage Encounter"?

04:24.389 --> 04:28.810
Yes, well, we mainly went because
Allan and Betty swore by it.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.478
As did the Garlingtons.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.982
Very big on communication,
expressing your feelings,

04:33.982 --> 04:35.400
and so forth.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.944
Yeah.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.947
Do you know if Betty Gore
was having an affair?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.368
No.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.162
No, I wouldn't know about that.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.457
Do you know whether Allan Gore
was having an affair?

04:53.543 --> 04:54.711
No.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.754
What about you and your husband?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
Have either of you
had any outside affairs?

05:00.216 --> 05:01.676
Pat wouldn't do that.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.219
But you would?

05:06.889 --> 05:08.099
I did.

05:08.933 --> 05:09.809
You did?

05:12.645 --> 05:13.521
With who?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.860
I had an affair with Allan Gore.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.829
You murdered Betty Gore, didn't you?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.790
No, I didn't.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.916
I think you did.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.712
You're wrong.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.673
You seem pretty composed in your denial.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.010
Most people get accused of murder,

05:44.010 --> 05:46.512
they react with hysterics.
You're cool as a cucumber.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.602
Betty Gore was your friend.

05:54.687 --> 05:58.816
You slept with her husband
and then you cut her up with an axe.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.655
You just chopped and chopped
and chopped and chopped on her

06:04.655 --> 06:07.450
and then you sit here
and lie to us about it.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.536
You make me so sick, I can't even stay
in the same room with you anymore.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.585
Well.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.093
You know,
my grandfather always used to say,

06:26.677 --> 06:31.682
"Sometimes in a bad situation,
all you can do is make the best of it."

06:33.351 --> 06:34.977
I think the best thing
that you can do here,

06:36.229 --> 06:37.688
Mrs. Montgomery,

06:37.688 --> 06:39.315
is tell us the truth.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.527
I didn't murder her.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.987
I didn't do it.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.826
Well, I think you did.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.245
And I think a jury might think you did.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.124
If I show 'em this fingerprint,

06:56.124 --> 06:59.585
and I tell 'em it's your print,
and I show 'em the footprints

06:59.585 --> 07:02.088
- in Betty Gore's house--
- They're gonna think I did it, too.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.133
But, I didn't.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.720
You care if we looked over your car?

07:12.098 --> 07:13.266
No.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.991
You're tryin' to pin something on me
and that's not right.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.369
You're tryin' to manipulate me
to admit something I didn't do.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.829
Those sandals?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.498
Mind if we kept those shoes for a while?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.084
No.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.595
Appreciate if we could have
the shoes you're wearing, too.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.779
This is not fair what you're doin'.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.670
<i>They actually came right out
and accused you?</i>

08:24.670 --> 08:27.006
And they weren't very nice
about it either.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.549
- Jesus.
- Honey.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.178
Tell him about the affair.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.514
Go ahead.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.683
Hold on. Hold on.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.938
Before we say anything else,
you need to retain me as counsel

08:41.938 --> 08:44.106
so we have attorney-client privilege.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.567
Pat, write me out a check.
Doesn't matter what it's for.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.570
- $100, and put the date and time on it.
- Okay.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.073
And do it outside in the outer office.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.450
- I need to talk to Candy alone.
- Why?

08:54.450 --> 08:55.868
Because I do.

08:55.868 --> 09:00.039
Just wait outside
or drive around for 10 or 15 minutes.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.749
Okay.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.512
What affair?

09:15.221 --> 09:18.057
I had an affair with Allan Gore.

09:19.058 --> 09:23.521
But it's over.
It has been over for eight months.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.648
Did Betty know about that?

09:27.066 --> 09:30.278
It seems she might have.
She brought it up. On the day.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.495
Did the police read you your rights?

09:39.495 --> 09:40.788
No.

09:40.788 --> 09:43.124
I'm gonna pay a little visit
to the police on process.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.376
Meantime, I want you to call
all the women at church.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.795
Everyone who saw you
at Bible school last Friday,

09:47.795 --> 09:49.922
ask them if they remember
what you were wearin'.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.591
What? Why?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.092
For you to have done
what they're suggesting,

09:53.092 --> 09:54.593
you'd have had blood all over you.

09:54.593 --> 09:57.263
I wanna establish a record
that you looked normal,

09:57.263 --> 09:59.348
and you'd be surprised
how fast memories can fade,

09:59.348 --> 10:01.350
- so do this today.
- Don.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.435
Just do it, Candy.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.854
And if you can pass
a private polygraph test,

10:04.854 --> 10:06.939
we might be able to clear this up
right away.

10:07.982 --> 10:14.322
And no communication whatsoever
going forward with Allan Gore.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.741
We don't know what he's saying or to who.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.951
You do not talk to him.

10:19.493 --> 10:24.373
He leaves for Kansas today anyway.
There's another service tomorrow.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.351
Yes, sir.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.896
No, I wouldn't--

11:29.980 --> 11:31.899
I wouldn't have a problem with that.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.865
I don't have anything to say
that I haven't already told you.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.494
I understand.

11:48.958 --> 11:49.917
Yes, sir.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.213
Thank you.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.718
What's going on?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.722
Is there some place where we can go
and talk in private,

12:03.722 --> 12:05.057
you, me, and Bertha?

12:05.057 --> 12:07.393
Sure. Come over here.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.233
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.154
I had

12:19.947 --> 12:22.658
an affair with a woman.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.787
And it wasn't

12:28.205 --> 12:31.625
anything.
She didn't mean anything to me.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.170
It's over now.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.925
It's been over for more than six months.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.973
My God, Allan. How could you?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.565
The reason I'm telling you this

12:54.565 --> 12:57.443
is because I've talked to the police

12:58.402 --> 12:59.278
and...

13:00.321 --> 13:04.658
they tell me she is a suspect
in the murder.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.620
The woman you had an affair with?

13:08.829 --> 13:09.747
Yes.

13:11.749 --> 13:16.045
Her name is Candy Montgomery,
and she was the woman.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.923
They think she did it?

13:20.841 --> 13:22.760
It seems so.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.306
Has she been arrested?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.349
No, I don't--

13:29.517 --> 13:31.644
Honey, can you please just give us
a few more minutes?

13:38.359 --> 13:41.237
From what I understand,
she is the main suspect.

13:46.492 --> 13:50.412
<i>...but these recent developments
have the quiet Dallas suburb on edge.</i>

13:50.412 --> 13:52.206
<i>No evidence of a break-in,</i>

13:52.206 --> 13:54.792
<i>you'll recall there was
no sign of forced entry.</i>

13:54.792 --> 13:57.294
<i>And we've been told the police
consider it more than likely</i>

13:57.294 --> 14:00.923
<i>that Betty Gore was murdered
by someone she knew.</i>

14:00.923 --> 14:03.801
<i>And now, an Eyewitness News
report on the recent...</i>

14:03.801 --> 14:08.847
It's in the papers, too.
"Female friend of Allan Gore."

14:08.847 --> 14:10.808
What are the lawyers tellin' her?

14:13.185 --> 14:14.603
She hasn't said.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.897
She say anything to you?

14:16.897 --> 14:18.274
No.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.528
It's okay. I'll get it.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.115
Thank you.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.576
I'll get it.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.710
- May I help you?
- Hi.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.628
I'm looking for Candy Montgomery.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.423
- A reporter from where?
- "The Times Herald."

14:42.423 --> 14:45.092
And there's stuff on the television,
in the newspapers.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.803
The police are clearly
talkin' to the media.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.347
This is gonna get rougher
before it gets better.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.474
I think a little media prep
would be a good idea.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.892
Can you come to my house?

14:54.977 --> 14:55.936
Yeah. When?

14:55.936 --> 14:58.480
- Like, right now.
- I'm on my way.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.448
<i>The police aren't exactly sharing,</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:53.202
but I can't believe
they really think you did it.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.039
And I don't think you did it.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.832
That said,

16:01.168 --> 16:03.962
there are three people in the world
you should never lie to.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.881
Your pastor, your doctor,

16:05.881 --> 16:08.384
and your lawyer. So

16:09.635 --> 16:11.887
don't lie to me, Candy. Okay?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.430
Okay.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.434
I think you know who did do it.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.562
I think you're covering up somethin'.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.024
Who are you covering for?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.485
No one.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.739
Candy.

16:35.119 --> 16:41.083
The truth has a way of comin' out,
and I need to be prepared for it

16:41.083 --> 16:42.501
if I'm gonna do you any good.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.088
Did you walk in on somethin'?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.340
And get scared?

16:49.258 --> 16:50.259
No.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.219
Candy.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.887
Allan didn't do it.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.723
- You're sure?
- Positive.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.974
How can you be positive?

17:03.939 --> 17:05.357
Because I did it.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.277
What?

17:08.944 --> 17:09.820
I did it.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.242
I don't believe you.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.580
She came at me.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.541
So, I did it.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.725
Pat doesn't know?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.935
Of course not.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.521
What would he do if you told him?

17:46.774 --> 17:49.234
I don't know. He's a very

17:49.902 --> 17:51.111
honest person.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.239
He might tell the police for my own good.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.784
Then, you definitely do not tell Pat.

17:56.784 --> 18:00.037
You understand?
You tell nobody.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.165
The only person you
talk to about this is me.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.676
Also, you should know.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.055
I talk a pretty good game
in the church parking lot

18:18.055 --> 18:21.975
but I've never tried
a criminal case in my life.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.395
I'm a personal injury guy.

18:25.395 --> 18:29.358
You're gonna need
an experienced criminal attorney.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.444
Now, I got a young kid.
His name is Robert Udashen.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.862
Smart as hell.

18:33.862 --> 18:37.199
But, we may need to get somebody

18:37.991 --> 18:39.493
beyond that even.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.995
Somebody big.
'Cause this here is...

18:42.704 --> 18:46.792
No, I want someone that I can trust.
I want you.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.920
Candy, you need a real criminal attorney.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.048
I want you.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.175
Do you know who caused your wife's death?

18:55.175 --> 18:57.803
- No.
- You went outside to pet the dog?

18:57.803 --> 19:00.097
They just got a new puppy, yes.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.641
On or about June 13th, 1980,

19:02.641 --> 19:04.893
are you yourself the one who caused
your wife's death?

19:04.893 --> 19:05.894
No.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.479
After you pet the puppy,

19:07.479 --> 19:10.524
you went into the utility room
to get Alisa's swimsuit?

19:10.524 --> 19:12.734
- Yes.
- At the time your wife was killed,

19:12.734 --> 19:14.987
were you physically present in the home?

19:14.987 --> 19:17.739
- No.
- Is that when you cut your foot?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.741
In the utility room?

19:19.741 --> 19:22.494
Did you plan or set up with anyone
to have your wife killed?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.412
No.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.040
Did you cut your foot in the utility room?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.126
I don't wanna talk about that.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.711
- No.
- I don't wanna talk

19:30.711 --> 19:32.462
about anything that happened in that room.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.173
No.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.847
I don't like that you're smoking again.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.561
Well, if someone accused you
of chopping up a person

19:47.561 --> 19:49.688
with an axe, you would maybe smoke, too.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.787
Hey, what happened...

20:06.914 --> 20:09.333
to that pair of thongs
that you used to wear?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.211
I gave those to the police.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.671
No, not, not those. The other pair.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.386
I don't know. I threw them away.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.600
When?

20:27.643 --> 20:29.353
A while ago. I don't know.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.109
Why are you being so curious
all of a sudden?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.283
Maybe if I'd been
a little more curious before,

20:43.283 --> 20:44.952
we wouldn't be in this situation.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.413
What's that supposed to mean?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.084
It's supposed to mean what it means, Candy.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.467
I don't like this tone.

21:01.218 --> 21:06.139
I'm wondering if she's maybe got some
split personality or something.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.850
Have you seen signs of that before?

21:08.850 --> 21:09.810
Never.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.315
She's like the most normal person
on the planet.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.903
Word is Allan Gore passed his polygraph.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.031
What are they waitin' for then?

21:25.617 --> 21:27.035
I don't know.

21:28.286 --> 21:31.623
I'm also hearing that Betty
was universally unliked.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.626
At the church.
At the school where she taught.

21:35.252 --> 21:40.173
They could still be running down leads,
going through the process of elimination.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.884
Come on.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.346
Eliminating people who'd
wanna take an axe to her?

21:47.055 --> 21:48.557
How long can the list be?

21:55.272 --> 21:57.065
<i>Do people actually think
that I'm involved in this?</i>

21:57.816 --> 22:02.946
Of course, they don't.
The people in this town know you, Candy.

22:02.946 --> 22:06.033
And they know that the idea of you--

22:07.743 --> 22:08.994
It's ridiculous.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.787
Even Pat.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.668
But you know that I'm innocent, don't you?

22:18.587 --> 22:21.506
- Of course, I do.
- No, I couldn't do that.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.354
- Hello?
- <i>Candy.</i>

22:36.354 --> 22:38.356
I'm afraid it's happenin'.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.317
They just issued a warrant
for your arrest.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.820
<i>Are you there?</i>

22:45.697 --> 22:48.241
- Yeah, I'm here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

22:48.241 --> 22:51.203
I'm passin' the phone to Robert.
You do as he says.

22:54.748 --> 22:55.791
<i>Candy,</i>

22:55.791 --> 22:58.835
after we hang up,
get yourself to Don's office right away.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.630
We wanna have positive control
over the surrender, okay?

23:02.631 --> 23:03.757
Where's Pat?

23:05.300 --> 23:06.301
At work.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.345
<i>Okay, call him.</i>

23:08.345 --> 23:10.305
The bond will be set for $100,000.

23:10.305 --> 23:13.100
<i>That means you'll need to
come up with $10,000 today</i>

23:13.100 --> 23:15.477
<i>to avoid you being put in jail.</i>

23:15.477 --> 23:17.646
<i>We're in the process of tracking down
a bail bondsman</i>

23:17.646 --> 23:21.066
but we need to have all that in place
before we turn you in, okay?

23:22.692 --> 23:23.944
Yeah.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.445
<i>Alright.</i>

23:37.332 --> 23:39.793
If anything,
this just shows how desperate they are.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.006
You are low-hanging fruit, that's all.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.681
<i>Our top story today is local housewife</i>

23:52.681 --> 23:55.433
<i>Candace Lynn Montgomery
is being sought this afternoon</i>

23:55.433 --> 23:58.645
<i>after being charged with murder
in the hacking death of Betty Gore--</i>

24:02.899 --> 24:04.818
Are they gonna put Mommy in jail?

24:09.114 --> 24:12.909
We know Mommy,
and we love Mommy.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.536
We know she didn't do it.

24:15.453 --> 24:16.872
We...

24:18.874 --> 24:20.292
We all love her.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.211
She lives here, for God's sake,

24:23.211 --> 24:25.755
and she's been under investigation
for a week.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.799
If she wanted to run,
she woulda done it already.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.220
- Robert, judge's clerk on three!
- Alright. Just--

24:32.220 --> 24:33.430
I'm sorry. Give me one moment.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.432
Hello?

24:38.226 --> 24:39.436
Good. You're here.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.606
Why don't you wait in the kitchen

24:42.606 --> 24:44.983
while we sort this bond business?
It could take a while.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.736
I got Judge Ryan's clerk calling.
He wants her there now.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.446
Well, he's not gettin' her now.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.156
He doesn't even have jurisdiction yet.

24:55.869 --> 24:56.745
Could you take her in the kitchen?

24:57.621 --> 24:58.997
You okay?

24:59.456 --> 25:01.333
- Fine.
- Okay. Come on.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.044
<i>We were told Mrs. Montgomery
would be surrendering herself</i>

25:04.044 --> 25:05.587
<i>but that hasn't happened yet.</i>

25:05.587 --> 25:08.506
Now, Mrs. Montgomery
has no prior arrest record,

25:08.506 --> 25:11.051
has a stellar reputation in the community,

25:11.051 --> 25:13.178
and is an active member
in the local church,

25:13.178 --> 25:17.265
which makes bail a possibility,
even in a gruesome murder such as this.

25:17.265 --> 25:21.353
We are not delaying, Your Honor.
We're just having a problem with the bond,

25:21.353 --> 25:23.730
which should resolve itself any moment.

25:23.730 --> 25:27.651
Look, given the hour, maybe it makes sense
to bring Mrs. Montgomery in the morning.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.153
<i>Oh, bullshit.
I don't give a damn how late the hour is.</i>

25:30.153 --> 25:32.405
<i>Get Crowder on the phone in a hurry!</i>

25:32.405 --> 25:33.573
Yes, sir.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.826
He'd like to speak to you.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.328
It's Judge Ryan.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.960
How we doin', Judge?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.836
<i>Crowder, what the hell you trying to pull?</i>

25:46.836 --> 25:49.256
- We're working on the bond.
- <i>Bullshit.</i>

25:49.256 --> 25:50.966
And what do you even care?

25:50.966 --> 25:53.635
This is not in your court or any court.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.930
This is still a sheriff's matter.
We will have her up there.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.348
<i>Well, you better.</i>

25:58.348 --> 25:59.808
<i>Like, right now
if you know what's good for you.</i>

26:01.393 --> 26:02.394
Fat fuck.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.941
Hey, we better get her up there.

26:08.858 --> 26:12.112
Pissing off a district judge
is not what we need.

26:12.112 --> 26:18.535
You go and I'll stay here
and lock down the bond. Fat fuck.

26:23.832 --> 26:24.666
Candy.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.210
I made cookies.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.379
It's time.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.094
So, why isn't Don coming?

26:37.429 --> 26:39.097
It's a bit "all hands on deck."

26:39.806 --> 26:41.349
This will just be an arraignment.

26:41.349 --> 26:44.811
You won't have to do anything
or say anything.

26:44.811 --> 26:48.565
We'll enter a plea of not guilty,
have a brief discussion of bail.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.983
We should be in and out in 20 minutes.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.359
Okay.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.153
Oh, shit.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.863
What's all this?

26:56.489 --> 26:59.326
This would be us.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.202
Oh, my God.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.205
What's gonna happen?

27:04.622 --> 27:08.960
Say nothing and stick by my side.
I'm gonna pull into the sally port,

27:08.960 --> 27:10.545
and they'll close the door down

27:10.545 --> 27:11.713
- after the public. Okay?
- Okay.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.323
- Just do not open your door.
- Okay.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.658
Follow me.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.296
Candace Lynn Montgomery?

27:53.797 --> 27:55.006
You are under arrest.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.633
You're under arrest
for the offense of murder.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.594
You have the right to remain silent.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.595
Are you kidding me?

28:00.595 --> 28:03.098
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.265
You have the right to an attorney.

28:07.685 --> 28:09.604
- No, you can't go with her.
- What? Why not?

28:09.604 --> 28:11.606
You gotta go through the main entrance.

28:12.065 --> 28:12.941
Don't talk to anybody!

28:29.165 --> 28:30.625
Take off your shirt and hand it to me.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.052
Alright, now take off your pants,
and hand them to me.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.860
Now, take off your bra.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.472
<i>They fucked us.</i>

29:25.472 --> 29:27.098
She's in jail!?

29:27.098 --> 29:28.349
They wouldn't accept our bond.

29:28.349 --> 29:31.853
Don, Don,
you told me you would get her out.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.688
- <i>Pat.</i>
- You told me!

29:33.688 --> 29:37.400
Robert negotiated the terms of surrender
with the sheriff and the DA.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.235
<i>They didn't do what we agreed to do.</i>

29:39.235 --> 29:40.778
Why? Why the hell not?

29:40.778 --> 29:43.865
Because they're assholes,
and they wanted to make a grand showing.

29:43.865 --> 29:47.076
<i>The bond came from Dallas County. Technically,</i>

29:47.076 --> 29:48.786
they have the right to refuse

29:48.786 --> 29:50.872
an out-of-county bond,
and that's what they did.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.082
Oh, my God!

29:53.082 --> 29:56.711
<i>We will have her out first thing,
I promise you.</i>

29:57.378 --> 29:59.797
They want a war? We'll give it to 'em.

29:59.797 --> 30:04.177
<i>She reportedly was having an affair
with Betty Gore's husband, Allan Gore.</i>

30:04.177 --> 30:07.639
<i>She was also the last person
to see Betty Gore alive.</i>

30:07.639 --> 30:11.017
<i>And we're being told the bloody thumbprint
from the freezer door</i>

30:11.017 --> 30:13.186
<i>is a match with the suspect.</i>

30:16.064 --> 30:17.482
<i>Be with me.</i>

30:59.566 --> 31:02.360
- Elaine?
- Hey, Allan.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.821
I'm dropping off.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.448
The food, remember? I called.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.409
It's my turn tomorrow,

31:09.409 --> 31:11.953
- but I'll be out of town.
- Yes, yes.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.330
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.710
Well, I'll leave you to it.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.381
<i>Anyone who has looked at this crime
for more than five minutes knows</i>

31:23.381 --> 31:25.550
<i>it had to be performed by a man.</i>

31:25.550 --> 31:28.344
<i>Candy Montgomery couldn't
even lift an axe like that,</i>

31:28.344 --> 31:29.637
<i>much less swing it.</i>

31:29.637 --> 31:31.306
What do you think happened then?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.266
Well, we got a number of people
we're investigating.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.226
I'm not at liberty to use any names,

31:35.226 --> 31:37.061
but I'll say this right now.

31:37.061 --> 31:40.773
The case against Candy Montgomery
is one big pile of wet hooey.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.652
I'm not sure talking to the media
like that is a good idea.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.904
The police are talkin'.
We need to keep pace.

31:46.904 --> 31:48.364
It could backfire.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.951
Are you lookin' at these newspapers?

31:55.371 --> 31:57.457
She's suddenly the Scarlet Woman!

31:57.457 --> 31:59.792
The brazen, axe-wielding hussy!

31:59.792 --> 32:02.837
If we don't stay ahead of that,

32:02.837 --> 32:04.881
she's gonna be as good as convicted

32:04.881 --> 32:06.591
by the time we call the first witness!

32:15.600 --> 32:18.144
Candace Montgomery surrendered
to authorities last night

32:18.144 --> 32:20.480
with a curious, bewildering smile.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.191
<i>She had been a suspect
for more than a week.</i>

32:23.191 --> 32:25.443
<i>Her lawyer and the Collin County DA</i>

32:25.443 --> 32:28.738
<i>struck an agreement allowing her
to turn herself in.</i>

32:28.738 --> 32:32.075
<i>Bond was set at $100,000.</i>

32:32.075 --> 32:33.618
<i>Here's the thing about trials.</i>

32:33.618 --> 32:34.535
They're fuck-fests.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.580
Both sides trying to fuck each other over.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.624
It's not cat and mouse,
it's not a chess game,

32:39.624 --> 32:40.917
and it's not civil.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.128
I'm not going to go gently
on them and, full disclosure,

32:44.128 --> 32:46.297
I won't be treading lightly on you.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.424
If we're gonna win this,
I need to take over,

32:48.424 --> 32:50.426
and you need to do everything I tell you.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.138
- Okay.
- First thing, lose some weight.

32:54.138 --> 32:57.183
I want you as small as possible.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.061
I'm not exactly sure what
my legal strategy will be yet,

33:00.061 --> 33:02.021
but I want the full menu available,

33:02.021 --> 33:04.107
including, "Look how tiny she is.

33:04.107 --> 33:08.486
"She couldn't possibly have overtaken
Betty Gore and swung an axe that big."

33:08.486 --> 33:09.904
You also need to change your hair.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.240
Somethin' more conservative.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.242
I'll choose your wardrobe.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.537
And this is a big one.

33:17.537 --> 33:22.333
No matter how tough you think you are,
I don't want you acting tough.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.920
I'll be the tough guy.
You'll be the mousy housewife.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.756
The mother.
The singer in the church choir.

33:29.382 --> 33:32.552
Speaking of that, no more in that choir

33:32.552 --> 33:35.680
- till after this is over.
- That choir is my salvation.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.681
Pick another one.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.643
You are being very aggressive with me.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.520
You're damn right I am.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.064
I don't feel I got the whole picture here.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.525
There's the Candy Montgomery I know,

33:47.525 --> 33:49.485
and the one who chopped up Betty Gore.

33:49.485 --> 33:52.822
She. Came. At me!

33:56.200 --> 33:58.953
Robert thinks it's a good idea
for you to meet with a psychiatrist.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.540
His name is Dr. Fred Fason,
outta Houston.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.001
Houston? I can't go to Houston!

34:05.001 --> 34:06.586
Yes, you can!

34:06.586 --> 34:08.004
For me to help you,

34:08.004 --> 34:10.506
I need to know exactly
what I'm dealing with.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.633
Which, right now, I don't.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.599
He also wants to change venue.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.225
He thinks Galveston.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.019
Galveston?

34:23.519 --> 34:25.438
Or Port Arthur. Just

34:26.147 --> 34:28.566
someplace where people
are more used to murder.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.487
Okay.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.615
What's he saying about the case?
The strategy?

34:35.615 --> 34:37.742
He doesn't want me to talk about it.

34:38.493 --> 34:39.452
What do you mean?

34:40.161 --> 34:42.246
He doesn't want me to talk about it.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.375
- Not even with me?
- No, not with anyone.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.212
And honestly, Pat, I don't want to.
I'm so tired.

34:49.212 --> 34:53.800
I'm just gonna turn this whole matter
over to God and Don

34:53.800 --> 34:55.968
and just not talk about it
with anybody else.

34:55.968 --> 34:59.096
Candy, I am your husband.
You need to talk to me.

34:59.096 --> 35:01.098
Do you know what I need?

35:02.058 --> 35:03.935
I need to follow my lawyer's advice.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.897
He's in charge. Don Crowder.
And God.

35:10.733 --> 35:13.110
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not doing too good.

35:30.419 --> 35:33.756
I know, baby. And I'm sorry.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.466
I'm sorry.

35:39.428 --> 35:40.805
We will get through this.

35:42.598 --> 35:45.434
I'm not exactly sure how, but we will.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.650
<i>She's gonna need the support
of this congregation.</i>

35:52.650 --> 35:54.944
I still can't believe it.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.488
Every worshipper here
is a potential character witness

35:57.488 --> 36:00.241
and knows the idea of her
doing this is bullshit.

36:01.033 --> 36:02.285
And Ron...

36:02.994 --> 36:05.997
<i>- it ain't just gonna be Candy.</i>
- What do you mean?

36:07.164 --> 36:09.792
This church will be put on trial.

36:09.792 --> 36:12.420
Lucas Methodist will never survive
a murder conviction

36:12.420 --> 36:14.255
against one of its congregants.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.298
But

36:16.090 --> 36:17.842
we just built our new sanctuary.

36:18.467 --> 36:21.220
God knows Candy couldn't have done this.

36:21.971 --> 36:25.182
The congregation needs to understand
that God knows this.

36:25.808 --> 36:28.603
<i>The pastor is the one
that needs to tell 'em.</i>

36:28.603 --> 36:30.062
I understand.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.609
<i>The courtroom is already packed
with those lucky enough to get in.</i>

36:34.609 --> 36:37.778
Of course, the lawyers
and members of the media are present,

36:37.778 --> 36:41.866
but one person not in that room today
is the defendant, Candy Montgomery.

36:41.866 --> 36:45.411
For pretrial motions, in this case,
change of venue,

36:45.411 --> 36:47.246
her attendance is not required.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.916
And we're being told
that not only is she not here,

36:49.916 --> 36:51.876
she's not even in the jurisdiction.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.713
Alright now.
Before we get to the matter of venue,

36:55.713 --> 36:57.673
y'all better listen to me.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.842
Been a little too much jabberin'
by both sides

36:59.842 --> 37:01.552
to the newspapers and whatnot.

37:01.552 --> 37:06.015
I don't wanna see or hear or read
anything in the media

37:06.015 --> 37:09.185
that has Don Crowder's name to it,
Robert Udashen's name to it,

37:09.185 --> 37:10.937
Tom O'Connell's, Jack Pepper,

37:10.937 --> 37:13.689
anyone involved in
the prosecution of this case.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.650
And if I do,

37:15.650 --> 37:17.151
I'ma put you in jail.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.487
And then
you're gonna have to try your lawsuit

37:19.487 --> 37:20.821
from a cell block.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.657
Show's over, gentlemen.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.868
And if you want to test me,

37:26.994 --> 37:27.954
I invite it.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.416
Now, on venue.

37:32.416 --> 37:36.879
Mr. Crowder, I've seen your papers,
and I am not impressed.

37:36.879 --> 37:40.174
Actually, Judge,
those papers are meant to be read.

37:40.174 --> 37:42.718
If you look closely,
you'll see words on 'em,

37:42.718 --> 37:45.179
arranged in a particular order, even.

37:48.140 --> 37:51.352
- What are you doing?
- I'm not gonna let him walk all over us.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.311
Fat fuck.

37:55.147 --> 37:57.483
I've already got half a mind
to bounce you from this whole deal.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.151
On what grounds?

37:59.151 --> 38:01.112
On the grounds
you're outta your league some.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.614
What business do you have
taking on a criminal case,

38:04.657 --> 38:06.117
especially one of this magnitude?

38:06.117 --> 38:09.745
I'm here because my client hired me.
As is her right.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.374
Maybe we could kick off
with that little refresher.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.001
Criminal defendants get rights.

38:15.501 --> 38:18.045
- Tread carefully, Mr. Crowder.
- Come on, Don.

38:18.045 --> 38:20.131
This trial should not be held
in Collin County.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.175
I would think you'd beg for it.
Folks here might know

38:23.175 --> 38:25.636
your client to have a modicum of goodness.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.471
To the rest of the nation,
she's an axe murderer.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.598
And what is she to you, Judge?

38:30.850 --> 38:32.768
I just call balls and strikes.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.271
And it's strike one on you right now.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.940
The defense called a total
of seven witnesses,

38:37.940 --> 38:41.193
submitted nine sworn affidavits,
and, without exception,

38:41.193 --> 38:44.196
they all testified that every living,
breathing person

38:44.196 --> 38:48.200
in Collin County with access to a radio,
TV, or newspaper

38:48.200 --> 38:50.745
thinks Candy Montgomery
to be guilty of murder.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.039
<i>In the end,
Judge Ryan felt that they would be able</i>

38:53.039 --> 38:56.792
<i>to ignore their preconceived opinions,
and he denied the motion to change venue.</i>

38:58.252 --> 39:01.005
<i>I'm not running a beauty pageant.
I'm not running for God.</i>

39:02.131 --> 39:03.966
<i>I'm Tom Ryan.</i>

39:06.802 --> 39:09.430
Don doesn't like him one bit,
and I'm beginnin' to see why.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.192
What is this trip to Houston about?

39:23.319 --> 39:26.155
They want her to meet
with some psychiatrist.

39:26.155 --> 39:27.865
I don't, I don't know exactly why.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.076
Well, what's Candy tellin' you?

39:30.076 --> 39:32.078
She doesn't wanna talk about it.

39:32.078 --> 39:35.122
That doesn't make sense, Pat.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.541
I don't wanna put pressure on her.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.506
Is she guilty of this?

39:44.715 --> 39:45.674
No.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.094
- No.
- You have doubts.

39:50.262 --> 39:51.305
Questions, maybe.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.516
- Like?
- Like,

39:53.516 --> 39:55.643
why would she throw away her thongs?

39:55.643 --> 39:58.270
Why can't she discuss the case with me?

39:58.270 --> 39:59.772
And

39:59.772 --> 40:02.024
why did she have cuts
and bruises all over her?

40:02.024 --> 40:04.068
Did you ask her about those things?

40:04.068 --> 40:05.778
No, I can't. Any time I--

40:09.532 --> 40:10.866
What'd I miss?

40:14.745 --> 40:16.956
I don't understand why
you have to be so secretive.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.667
Oh gosh, I told you, Pat.

40:20.417 --> 40:22.670
It's because the lawyers want it that way.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.338
Candy!

40:24.338 --> 40:28.134
You oughta be more open with Pat.
And me, for that matter.

40:28.134 --> 40:32.721
Is there anything that happened that day
you haven't told us about?

40:34.431 --> 40:36.767
I did not murder Betty Gore.

40:38.352 --> 40:42.022
You and I are back-door friends.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.277
I did not do it.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.947
Everybody thinks I'm a monster.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.950
My former pastor, maybe my husband.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.455
I don't know how much more
of this I can take, Don.

40:58.455 --> 41:01.417
Candy, let's first secure your freedom,

41:01.417 --> 41:04.211
then we can worry about
what folks think of you.

41:04.211 --> 41:07.339
I have to tell Pat.
He knows I'm not being honest.

41:07.339 --> 41:09.758
For today, our focus is Dr. Fason.

41:10.467 --> 41:13.220
I don't know what's so special
about this Dr. Fason.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.139
He can help us win at trial,

41:15.848 --> 41:18.601
which makes him special to me,
and I would think to you.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.604
What exactly do I tell him?

41:21.604 --> 41:23.522
I told you. You tell him everything.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.233
Which includes the room.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.945
You have to tell him everything
that happened in that room.

41:29.945 --> 41:30.821
Hello.

41:32.489 --> 41:33.449
Hi.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.083
Did you see that?

41:43.083 --> 41:45.044
I'm a sideshow!

41:50.257 --> 41:51.967
It's not right!

41:51.967 --> 41:53.510
It's not right that I'm being kept
in the dark!

41:53.510 --> 41:54.929
She's gonna fall apart!

41:55.721 --> 41:58.265
I can't help her
if I don't know what's going on!

41:59.058 --> 42:00.726
It's lawyer-client privilege, Pat.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.728
I'm her goddamn husband!

42:06.190 --> 42:08.150
I want you to pick a point
out on the wall.

42:09.485 --> 42:10.903
Focus on it.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.951
Now, take a deep breath.

42:16.951 --> 42:19.954
Filling your chest. Good.

42:20.871 --> 42:25.751
Slowly let the air out,
completely emptying your lungs.

42:26.794 --> 42:27.920
Very good. Again.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.339
Deep breath in.

42:32.508 --> 42:37.263
Slowly let the air out,
completely emptying the lungs.

42:39.306 --> 42:41.225
Everything here is safe.

42:43.310 --> 42:45.062
Calm.

42:47.815 --> 42:49.191
Peaceful.

42:53.904 --> 42:56.991
As you relax, your eyes may feel heavy
and want to close.

42:56.991 --> 43:00.244
That's okay. Let them drift and fall.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.542
Listen to your body.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.548
You are in complete control of this time.

43:15.050 --> 43:17.469
You really think this will help?

43:18.262 --> 43:19.805
I have no idea.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.766
It can't hurt.

43:23.809 --> 43:27.479
We're going to go back to June 13.

43:28.564 --> 43:31.775
When you went into
Betty Gore's utility room.

43:32.818 --> 43:36.405
When I snap my fingers,
you will begin re-experiencing

43:36.405 --> 43:39.491
and relating that time
as you go through it.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.369
One.

43:42.369 --> 43:44.496
Two.

43:44.496 --> 43:45.372
Three.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.462
What's happening, Candy?

43:52.921 --> 43:54.673
You can tell me.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.426
When I reach the count of three,

43:57.426 --> 44:01.096
your thoughts and your feelings
will get stronger and stronger.

44:01.096 --> 44:03.515
Stronger and stronger

44:04.433 --> 44:06.602
and stronger. So strong,

44:06.602 --> 44:10.230
you will have to verbalize them
and express them.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.732
One.

44:12.733 --> 44:15.944
Two. So strong,
you will have to get them out.

44:15.944 --> 44:17.821
Three. Let them out.

44:19.948 --> 44:21.867
What's that you're feeling, Candy?

44:26.914 --> 44:28.165
Hate.

44:29.124 --> 44:30.292
Okay.

44:32.086 --> 44:33.504
You hate her.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.758
Express your feelings.

44:37.758 --> 44:40.469
Stronger and stronger.

44:42.346 --> 44:44.181
I hate her.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.432
Say it loud.

44:46.683 --> 44:48.018
I hate her.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.812
Louder.

44:49.812 --> 44:52.022
I hate her!

44:52.856 --> 44:55.734
She's ruined my whole life.

44:55.734 --> 44:56.652
Look at this.

44:58.404 --> 44:59.613
I hate her!

45:01.115 --> 45:03.492
I hate her!

45:04.076 --> 45:05.494
When I count to three,

45:06.829 --> 45:10.582
I want you to go back in time
to when she's shoving you.

45:10.582 --> 45:16.004
You're in the utility room,
and she's shoving you. Just relax.

45:16.004 --> 45:17.631
One.

45:17.631 --> 45:18.882
Two.

45:18.882 --> 45:19.883
Three.

45:23.011 --> 45:24.263
What's happening now?

45:25.764 --> 45:26.640
Go through it.

45:31.353 --> 45:32.855
Feeling's very strong.

45:33.313 --> 45:34.356
You hear that?

45:36.733 --> 45:38.485
She sounds like a wounded animal.

45:38.485 --> 45:39.862
I don't want him.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.531
- You can't have him!
- No.

45:42.531 --> 45:44.158
The feelings are getting stronger.

45:45.325 --> 45:46.952
I don't want him!

45:47.536 --> 45:49.204
Why are you doing this?

45:50.664 --> 45:51.498
Betty!

45:52.332 --> 45:54.710
What is she doing now? Tell me, Candy.

45:54.710 --> 45:55.836
You.

45:56.503 --> 45:58.755
Stop! You stop!

46:00.466 --> 46:02.968
Stop! Stop it! Stop!

46:03.594 --> 46:06.054
Stop!

46:06.805 --> 46:09.057
- What the hell?
- Should we go in there?

46:13.645 --> 46:16.190
Oh, no.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.361
It's okay.

46:23.572 --> 46:24.740
It's over now.

46:26.074 --> 46:27.701
You're okay.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.621
You can't do that.

46:30.621 --> 46:34.416
Candy, do you ever recall
being this mad before?

46:37.836 --> 46:40.172
Maybe when you were little?

46:41.089 --> 46:42.799
Let's go back in time.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.761
One. Back in time. Two.

46:45.761 --> 46:47.221
Three.

46:48.347 --> 46:50.766
- How old are you, Candy?
- Four.

46:51.808 --> 46:53.393
Four years old.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.103
Why are you so mad?

46:57.523 --> 46:58.899
Why so mad?

47:05.447 --> 47:07.533
What will they think of you
in the waiting room?

47:07.533 --> 47:08.784
Stop crying. Shh!

47:12.871 --> 47:16.083
And how does it feel when she says "shh"?

47:16.083 --> 47:18.502
I wanna scream.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.003
Candy, on the count of three,

47:20.003 --> 47:22.256
- you're gonna scream all you want. One.
- I can't.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.549
You can. Two.

47:23.549 --> 47:24.925
Three.

47:35.269 --> 47:36.687
Is this real?

47:38.647 --> 47:40.315
Could she be faking?

47:42.067 --> 47:44.528
Candy, on three, you will feel no pain.

47:45.195 --> 47:47.656
You are incapable of feeling
any pain whatsoever.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.908
One, two, three.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.194
On three, you will feel very, very cold.

48:26.194 --> 48:28.947
Very cold. One. Two.

48:28.947 --> 48:30.449
Three.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.998
Look there.

48:41.710 --> 48:43.629
You ever know anyone
to fake a goosebump?

48:59.936 --> 49:01.355
Well, what did he say?

49:05.275 --> 49:06.109
That

49:07.319 --> 49:09.613
you snapped.

49:10.989 --> 49:12.991
That you're not a sociopath.

49:15.452 --> 49:18.455
You, you just snapped.

49:31.343 --> 49:33.220
So, what exactly did you talk about?

49:36.098 --> 49:38.266
Just all kinds of this and that.

49:39.726 --> 49:41.186
Honestly,
I'm not really sure of the point.

49:41.186 --> 49:44.731
I'm just glad to be back.

49:45.190 --> 49:47.859
Can you eat your Brussels sprouts,
young man?

49:49.945 --> 49:50.987
You, too, missy.

49:55.450 --> 49:58.078
Can Alisa still come for sleepovers?

49:59.871 --> 50:04.584
Of course, she can, sweetie.
She's still your best friend, right?

50:06.753 --> 50:09.673
It would be nice to have Alisa over.
I bet she misses you.

50:14.010 --> 50:15.387
I'll get it.

50:19.015 --> 50:19.933
Hello?

50:20.809 --> 50:22.602
Pat, it's Don Crowder.

50:23.228 --> 50:25.981
<i>Don't say anything.
Just listen for a bit, okay?</i>

50:27.399 --> 50:31.445
Candy says you wanna know the truth
about everything.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.322
<i>I'm thinking that's a good idea.</i>

50:35.657 --> 50:38.243
So I'm gonna tell you what happened.

50:39.161 --> 50:42.873
<i>- Is that okay, Pat?</i>
- Yes. Yeah, that's fine.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.916
I'm gonna tell you exactly.

50:47.502 --> 50:48.378
Mom?

50:49.087 --> 50:52.007
- What's gonna happen?
- Well

50:53.300 --> 50:55.635
there will just be a little trial.

50:57.053 --> 50:59.723
And they will present evidence
and so forth.

51:01.933 --> 51:05.604
And then, the jury will find that

51:05.604 --> 51:07.105
I'm innocent.

51:08.315 --> 51:12.486
And we can all go back to
being a normal family.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.784
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Yes.
