<i>(voice echoes)</i>

00:08.738 --> 00:12.407
<i>Hallå!</i>

00:12.408 --> 00:14.810
<i>Hallå.</i>

00:14.811 --> 00:17.546
<i>Hallå is grotta.</i>

00:17.547 --> 00:21.650
- (chuckles)
- What are you doing?

00:21.651 --> 00:23.619
I'm just practicing my Swedish.

00:23.620 --> 00:27.022
<i>Hallå is grotta.</i>
It means, "Hello, ice cave!"

00:27.023 --> 00:29.057
First of all,

00:29.058 --> 00:31.093
the translation is <i>hej isgrotta.</i>

00:31.094 --> 00:32.861
And why are you so cheerful?

00:32.862 --> 00:35.631
It's just a nice, normal,
everyday artifact retrieval.

00:35.632 --> 00:38.200
Yeah, an artifact that Flynn
was supposed to retrieve,

00:38.201 --> 00:41.236
but he skipped out again.
Now we gotta cover his backlog.

00:41.237 --> 00:43.172
Come on, you and I were built for this.

00:43.173 --> 00:46.475
We're a well-oiled machine.

00:46.476 --> 00:47.708
Come on.

01:00.122 --> 01:03.392
This date and location's been in
the Library's appointment book

01:03.393 --> 01:05.561
for nearly 600 years.

01:05.562 --> 01:07.930
It's a crystal that grows in
one of these ice formations.

01:07.931 --> 01:09.965
It's supposed to be steeped in magic.

01:09.966 --> 01:14.068
It's the one with... prime frost.

01:21.543 --> 01:22.778
Huh.

01:22.779 --> 01:26.114
Well, it all looks pretty frosty to me.

01:26.115 --> 01:28.951
I recalibrated the goggles

01:28.952 --> 01:32.087
to read the residual energy
of anything outside

01:32.088 --> 01:34.456
the spectrum of light
visible to the human eye.

01:34.457 --> 01:36.400
So that should help us
figure out which formation

01:36.401 --> 01:38.334
we need to take back with us.

01:39.828 --> 01:40.896
<i>Hmm. Nope.</i>

01:40.897 --> 01:42.631
Nope.

01:42.632 --> 01:45.634
Nope. What did you say
this thing was called again?

01:45.635 --> 01:47.369
The Angrboda crystal?

01:47.370 --> 01:49.371
I don't know. I think so.

01:49.372 --> 01:51.873
I mean, I copied it exactly
from the appointment book.

01:51.874 --> 01:54.942
But you know how atrocious
that handwriting...

01:56.878 --> 01:59.281
Um...

01:59.282 --> 02:01.916
Cassie, I don't think
you need the goggles.

02:07.422 --> 02:09.323
But we will need some help.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074

02:19.901 --> 02:21.502
Ezekiel?

02:22.971 --> 02:25.907
- Ezekiel.
- Hey! That was important.

02:25.908 --> 02:28.296
Don't worry. You'll get your
game back when we're done.

02:28.297 --> 02:30.045
And what precisely are we doing?

02:30.046 --> 02:32.342
Ezekiel, I've seen the kind
of Librarian you can become...

02:32.343 --> 02:36.103
responsible, a leader, someone
people can turn to for help.

02:36.104 --> 02:37.807
But you haven't reached
that potential yet,

02:37.808 --> 02:39.005
and we're gonna change that.

02:39.006 --> 02:40.874
Oh, I'm not into kinky stuff.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.310
It's not for you, it's for me.

02:43.311 --> 02:45.812
You're into kinky stuff?

02:45.813 --> 02:48.448
I've set up a series of traps
and obstacles in the Library

02:48.449 --> 02:49.950
and you're going to guide me through

02:49.951 --> 02:51.752
using just your voice.

02:51.753 --> 02:52.719
That's ridiculous.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.787
I have every faith in you.

02:56.289 --> 02:59.025
Okay, Ezekiel, you're in charge.

02:59.026 --> 03:00.593
Guide me.

03:01.528 --> 03:04.797
Ezekiel? Ezekiel?

03:06.900 --> 03:09.034
You're not here anymore are you?

03:16.409 --> 03:17.543
Ah!

03:18.745 --> 03:22.149
Well, basic physics isn't working.

03:22.150 --> 03:25.718
Time to try an upgrade.

03:26.820 --> 03:29.256
These symbols etched in here...

03:29.257 --> 03:30.557
They're runes.

03:30.558 --> 03:34.361
Yeah, Nordic and ancient.

03:34.362 --> 03:36.029
Of course.

03:36.030 --> 03:38.899
The ice and crystal grows.
I mean, slowly, but it grows.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.801
But if they're growing
in Runic designs,

03:40.802 --> 03:42.135
that means there's
consciousness at play.

03:42.136 --> 03:43.639
And if there's consciousness at play,

03:43.640 --> 03:44.771
that means I can confuse it.

03:44.772 --> 03:46.006
Like you're confusing me?

03:46.007 --> 03:48.708
We don't need the whole ice formation.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.310
We just need the crystal inside of it.

03:50.311 --> 03:52.879
- So if I use a spell...
- No spells.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.783
- We've been over this.
- You've been over this.

03:54.784 --> 03:56.149
I've been patently ignoring you.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.418
Magic has consequences.

03:58.419 --> 03:59.885
<i>(ice cracks)</i>

04:05.959 --> 04:08.128
I see you got your phone back.

04:08.129 --> 04:10.163
And your keys. Just for practice.

04:10.164 --> 04:12.465
I have to keep my skills sharp.

04:12.466 --> 04:14.000
I'm serious about this, Jones.

04:14.001 --> 04:15.902
If you were serious about this,

04:15.903 --> 04:18.605
you wouldn't have me lead you
through traps that you set up.

04:18.606 --> 04:19.738
There's no danger in that.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.208
You would have me set up the traps,

04:21.209 --> 04:23.476
but, obviously, you don't
trust me that much.

04:23.477 --> 04:27.480
Colonel, I wouldn't bother. Mr. Jones
has chosen a path of non-involvement,

04:27.481 --> 04:29.349
even when there are lives at stake.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.284
He's, well, like Switzerland,

04:31.285 --> 04:33.086
minus the odd affinity
for cuckoo clocks.

04:33.087 --> 04:35.989
I told you I'd help with whatever
once I'm done with this.

04:35.990 --> 04:37.439
What do you mean "lives at stake"?

04:37.440 --> 04:38.176
What is all that?

04:38.177 --> 04:39.840
Well, I'm hoping to
build a new incubator,

04:39.841 --> 04:41.457
since the old one is overheating.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.358
Ironic, for an incubator.

04:46.061 --> 04:47.437
No more games, Jones.

04:47.438 --> 04:50.872
There's real danger, and you
are gonna get us out of it.

04:53.188 --> 04:57.606
Oh, Colonel, really, I must protest.

04:57.607 --> 04:59.687
Nessie entrusted me with her egg.

04:59.688 --> 05:02.418
And now we are entrusting Ezekiel.

05:02.457 --> 05:05.459
Nessie? So you're telling
me that this is the egg

05:05.460 --> 05:06.761
of the Loch Ness Monster?

05:06.762 --> 05:09.730
Yes, it is. Nessie had
to go deal with some

05:09.731 --> 05:12.333
overzealous developers on her loch

05:12.334 --> 05:14.468
and she asked me to watch it.

05:14.469 --> 05:16.737
Jenkins, the incubator
is malfunctioning

05:16.738 --> 05:18.639
and I'm betting nothing works as well

05:18.640 --> 05:21.475
as good old fashioned body heat.

05:21.476 --> 05:23.377
Now, you can't put it down,

05:23.378 --> 05:24.945
you can't walk away from it.

05:24.946 --> 05:26.914
Keep it warm until
the incubator is fixed.

05:26.915 --> 05:29.219
Colonel, you really do believe
that this is the best idea?

05:29.220 --> 05:31.485
I have every faith in Ezekiel.

05:31.486 --> 05:33.254
Said no one ever.

05:33.255 --> 05:36.322
I don't know. Maybe it was an echo.

05:39.326 --> 05:43.529
You got a weak left.
Your right's good though.

05:54.675 --> 05:56.676
Stone!

06:20.668 --> 06:25.005
<i>De antiquis invoco deos.</i>

06:25.006 --> 06:30.611
<i>Quia opus factum est.</i>

06:30.612 --> 06:33.347
- <i>Ut quietam!</i>
- (crackling)

06:33.348 --> 06:35.015
Stone: <i>Whoever that was ran off,</i>

06:35.016 --> 06:36.884
but there is a blizzard out there.

06:36.885 --> 06:39.353
- What are you doing?
- Opening the ice formation.

06:39.354 --> 06:42.355
- Damn it, Cassandra, I told you...
- Too late now.

06:49.129 --> 06:50.397
See?

06:50.398 --> 06:52.066
I told you.

06:52.067 --> 06:54.934
In and out, lickety spl...

07:01.442 --> 07:02.575
What just happened?

07:05.613 --> 07:09.416
I think the crystal
went in my chest somehow.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.819
Let's get you back down the mountain,

07:11.820 --> 07:13.587
get you back to the Library.

07:13.588 --> 07:16.055
- In a blizzard?
- We have no choice.

07:25.699 --> 07:29.303
- Where'd that come from?
- I don't know,

07:29.304 --> 07:31.971
but that's where we're going.

07:43.317 --> 07:46.520
Better call Jenkins and
get the door moved here,

07:46.521 --> 07:50.391
- get you home.
- I got no signal.

07:50.392 --> 07:53.928
Hopefully this place
has a house phone that works.

07:53.929 --> 07:59.198
- Yeah.
- (rumbling)

08:27.995 --> 08:30.664
- Do you have a reservation?
- Oh! You speak English.

08:30.665 --> 08:32.399
(chuckles) Good.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.301
Listen, we got caught up in the storm.

08:34.302 --> 08:36.085
I was wondering if I
could borrow your phone.

08:36.086 --> 08:37.471
No phone.

08:37.472 --> 08:39.206
If you don't have a reservation,

08:39.207 --> 08:40.874
you need to leave.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.943
Pretty bad storm out there.

08:42.943 --> 08:45.245
We're hosting a private reunion.

08:45.246 --> 08:46.947
If you're not here for the reunion,

08:46.948 --> 08:48.716
you'll have to leave now.

08:48.717 --> 08:51.362
Of course we're here for the reunion.

08:51.363 --> 08:53.301
I didn't know if we have
the right hotel or not.

08:53.302 --> 08:56.390
That's me, Finklestein.

08:56.391 --> 08:57.992
- (bell dings)
- Good ol' Finklestein.

08:57.993 --> 09:00.426
Man: <i>That's not Finklestein!</i>

09:01.762 --> 09:03.163
<i>No way.</i>

09:03.164 --> 09:06.367
No way Finklestein
shows up at the reunion

09:06.368 --> 09:10.336
looking like a rock star.

09:13.140 --> 09:16.243
Come on. Come here, my friend.

09:16.244 --> 09:19.780
What? What? You don't recognize me?

09:19.781 --> 09:22.383
It's Olafsson, you crazy guy!

09:22.384 --> 09:24.083
- (laughing)
- (gasps)

09:29.790 --> 09:31.691
Oh, this is not good.

09:36.602 --> 09:39.049
Ah, what, been about 100...

09:39.050 --> 09:41.985
150 years since we last saw each other?

09:41.986 --> 09:45.289
Well, now I have the body of
a tax accountant from Tampa.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.491
Well you look great. You really do.

09:47.492 --> 09:49.560
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

09:49.561 --> 09:52.996
Oh, this, of course, is Norman.

09:52.997 --> 09:55.231
Awesome.

09:56.300 --> 09:58.769
- Oh, no.
- Awesome.

09:58.770 --> 10:03.140
And I believe you remember Meredith.

10:03.141 --> 10:04.541
Mm.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.310
If it isn't Finklestein.

10:06.311 --> 10:08.445
(giggles)

10:08.446 --> 10:11.281
Interesting look you chose.

10:11.282 --> 10:14.451
I can get past the symmetry
and muscles though.

10:14.452 --> 10:17.187
So is this your girlfriend?

10:17.188 --> 10:19.656
Both: No. No.

10:19.657 --> 10:24.695
- I'm his sister.
- That's my sister.

10:24.696 --> 10:26.530
Yeah, I've been bugging him for years

10:26.531 --> 10:30.501
to let me come, and finally he gave in.

10:30.502 --> 10:31.835
- Look, Finklestine...
- Stein.

10:31.836 --> 10:34.371
Yeah? I need to talk
to you about my goggles.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.607
Hey, I was worried you
brought in an outsider.

10:36.608 --> 10:39.209
Hey, remember the last time?
Remember the last time

10:39.210 --> 10:42.212
we had an interloper?
You remember this?

10:42.213 --> 10:46.583
Meredith practically
ripped his head off.

10:46.584 --> 10:49.253
I just didn't want anyone to
interrupt our special day.

10:49.254 --> 10:52.723
Okay. It was so nice
meeting all of you.

10:52.724 --> 10:54.758
A lot of stuff to catch up on, guys.

10:54.759 --> 10:58.262
- You can't hide now.
- We've been waiting for you.

10:58.263 --> 11:00.264
Now the festivities can begin.

11:00.265 --> 11:01.598
It's gonna be awesome.

11:01.599 --> 11:03.100
Your sister has orientation,

11:03.101 --> 11:05.301
but don't worry,
she'll be safe with me.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.641
- You sure they're late?
- Yes.

11:10.642 --> 11:12.209
If the ice formation had been there,

11:12.210 --> 11:14.211
they would be back by now.

11:14.212 --> 11:16.980
If not, Miss Cillian certainly would
have managed to send a message.

11:16.981 --> 11:18.244
Something must have gone wrong.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.416
You know, if it were me...

11:19.417 --> 11:20.584
One can only dream.

11:20.585 --> 11:22.319
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.488
- Yes, Ezekiel? What would you do?
- Nothing.

11:24.489 --> 11:26.723
Well, your sense of responsibility
continues to astound.

11:26.724 --> 11:29.359
By the way, where is your
present charge, the egg?

11:29.360 --> 11:30.561
Back in your lab.

11:30.562 --> 11:32.795
Yeah, I hooked up
a new incubator myself.

11:35.532 --> 11:38.468
- You wouldn't do anything?
- Did I say that?

11:38.469 --> 11:41.572
You've got GPS, radar, and
tracking equipment all right here.

11:41.573 --> 11:43.053
What are you gonna do on the mountain

11:43.054 --> 11:44.677
that can't be done
from this room besides

11:44.678 --> 11:45.776
endanger yourself?

11:45.777 --> 11:48.412
Wow, that's almost
responsible for other...

11:48.413 --> 11:52.249
He had it over a Bunsen burner.

11:52.250 --> 11:55.886
You said keep it warm, so I
rigged up a new incubator.

11:55.887 --> 11:57.430
- Is that not right?
- No, that's fine,

11:57.431 --> 11:59.323
if you'd like to have
a Loch Ness omelet.

11:59.324 --> 12:01.692
Ezekiel, your job
was not the incubator.

12:01.693 --> 12:03.560
Your job is the egg.

12:03.561 --> 12:06.029
All right, I'm sorry.

12:06.030 --> 12:07.497
- It won't happen again.
- Huh.

12:07.498 --> 12:09.666
- Let him have it.
- Colonel!

12:09.667 --> 12:12.369
If Miss Cillian had not put
protective spells on this,

12:12.370 --> 12:14.371
the egg would be cooked right now.

12:14.372 --> 12:16.839
Jenkins, give him another chance.

12:19.776 --> 12:23.780
Nessie only lays an egg
once every hundred years.

12:23.781 --> 12:25.382
So if this one gets hurt,
I'll be angry.

12:25.383 --> 12:28.118
But more importantly,
Nessie will be angry.

12:28.119 --> 12:29.886
And trust me,

12:29.887 --> 12:31.854
you won't like Nessie angry.

12:34.524 --> 12:37.661
- Jenkins, fire up the door.
- It's all connected, Colonel.

12:37.662 --> 12:41.363
Great, then let's get
our Librarians back.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.543
Norman, get us some steins.

12:58.015 --> 12:59.716
What's all the festivities?

12:59.717 --> 13:01.551
Oh, you know, the usual.

13:01.552 --> 13:04.054
A little drinking, a little gaming.

13:04.055 --> 13:06.056
Pathological need to one-up each other

13:06.057 --> 13:07.524
with whatever we've been doing

13:07.525 --> 13:09.726
over the last however long it's been.

13:09.727 --> 13:12.863
Hey, everybody! It's Finklestein!

13:12.864 --> 13:15.732
- Crowd: Finklestein!
- You, drink.

13:15.733 --> 13:18.968
- Awesome that you're here, man.
- Thank you.

13:22.005 --> 13:24.508
Ta-da! The only orientation you need.

13:24.509 --> 13:27.110
Bartender, two bloody Marys.

13:27.111 --> 13:29.246
There's real Mary in them.

13:29.247 --> 13:31.448
Nothing for me, thanks.

13:31.449 --> 13:33.583
I'm just tired from all the traveling.

13:33.584 --> 13:36.119
- I should probably...
- Oh, no, once the ceremony begins,

13:36.120 --> 13:37.654
you won't be tired at all.

13:37.655 --> 13:39.222
The ceremony?

13:39.223 --> 13:43.226
Finklestein didn't tell
you anything, did he?

13:43.227 --> 13:47.631
God. That man can be so...

13:47.632 --> 13:49.965
secretive.

13:59.176 --> 14:01.645
What are they playing?

14:01.646 --> 14:03.447
Has it really been so long

14:03.448 --> 14:06.349
you can't recognize a game
of Halatafl when you see it?

14:06.350 --> 14:07.951
That's the fox and the sheep.

14:07.952 --> 14:09.453
I know that game.

14:09.454 --> 14:12.656
I just... I didn't recognize
the Old Norse name for it.

14:12.657 --> 14:14.991
Oh, I know. Don't get me started.

14:14.992 --> 14:16.960
I told the organizing
committee, I said,

14:16.961 --> 14:20.230
"We should be using the old languages."

14:20.231 --> 14:21.732
By Odin's beard, next time,

14:21.733 --> 14:25.202
we're gonna be speaking
and wearing Chinese.

14:25.203 --> 14:26.703
I'm learning Mandarin.

14:26.704 --> 14:30.540
- It's aw...
- Awesome. Yeah, we know.

14:30.541 --> 14:33.176
That would be <i>zhen bàng</i> in Mandarin.

14:33.177 --> 14:35.344
You don't miss a step, do you?

14:36.747 --> 14:40.082
- Finklestein!
- Crowd: Finklestein!

14:42.719 --> 14:44.254
Your brother's a great guy.

14:44.255 --> 14:45.789
But if he says he's gonna call,

14:45.790 --> 14:47.491
he should call.

14:47.492 --> 14:49.493
I spent the 15th century waiting.

14:49.494 --> 14:51.995
At least he can't magic his
way out of seeing me here.

14:51.996 --> 14:55.098
- Um, did you say "magic?"
- You know, because of the truce.

14:55.099 --> 14:57.801
The ceremony is too important,
so for the reunion,

14:57.802 --> 14:59.236
we leave our magic at the door.

14:59.237 --> 15:01.204
Gentleman's agreement.

15:01.205 --> 15:03.673
We roasted some gentlemen
when we formed the pact,

15:03.674 --> 15:06.309
made it official.

15:06.310 --> 15:07.653
You know what? I think my brother

15:07.654 --> 15:09.613
would like to hear this
from you personally.

15:09.614 --> 15:10.981
So why don't I go get him

15:10.982 --> 15:12.616
- and I'll just...
- No, no.

15:12.617 --> 15:15.252
Is it me? Am I too leech-like,

15:15.253 --> 15:16.919
but, like, in a bad way?

15:24.661 --> 15:26.530
That's pretty brave,

15:26.531 --> 15:29.366
- taking Norman as your partner.
- Hey! Hey!

15:29.367 --> 15:33.802
Don't listen to the smack
talk from the peanut gallery.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.644
- (cheering)
- Oh!

15:40.645 --> 15:42.211
- Yeah!
- Hey!

15:43.280 --> 15:45.215
Hey! Holy...

15:45.216 --> 15:46.917
you never used to be this good.

15:46.918 --> 15:49.953
That good hair and
that handsome face...

15:49.954 --> 15:51.154
it's a little off-putting.

15:51.155 --> 15:53.790
You need, like, a droopy eye.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.425
You need a big gut.

15:55.426 --> 15:57.494
I'm serious. If you plan
on using this flesh bag

15:57.495 --> 15:58.995
on Meredith, she'll...

15:58.996 --> 16:01.665
well, actually after a
couple of bloody Marys,

16:01.666 --> 16:03.232
she'd probably be into it.

16:04.334 --> 16:05.969
Totally into it.

16:05.970 --> 16:08.705
- More beer!
- More beer!

16:08.706 --> 16:10.807
- Skål!
- Skål!

16:10.808 --> 16:14.110
No, it's not you.

16:14.111 --> 16:15.612
- It's him.
- Yeah.

16:15.613 --> 16:18.181
He's just so busy.

16:18.182 --> 16:22.085
You know, he can get really
focused and stubborn...

16:22.086 --> 16:25.322
totally not into new ideas at all.

16:25.323 --> 16:27.324
That's such a stupid guy thing.

16:27.325 --> 16:31.561
- I'm totally open to new ideas.
- I know, right?

16:31.562 --> 16:33.529
Right?

16:40.036 --> 16:43.540
Recently, I've been getting
involved with insurance.

16:43.541 --> 16:46.409
Do you know that only a small
percentage of the population

16:46.410 --> 16:48.578
has adequate coverage
for natural disasters?

16:48.579 --> 16:50.513
Norman? Really?

16:50.514 --> 16:55.617
Oh, yeah. Bankrupting them
has been totally awesome.

16:59.689 --> 17:03.226
Olafsson: <i>Now, me, I specialize now.</i>

17:03.227 --> 17:05.694
Oh, yeah. Extended drought here,

17:05.695 --> 17:09.031
targeted expansion of smallpox there.

17:09.032 --> 17:11.233
I like a good plague.

17:11.234 --> 17:13.837
You find a sick guy
and you walk him around

17:13.838 --> 17:15.672
and you have him cough on everybody.

17:15.673 --> 17:19.875
Cholera. Cholera is delightful.

17:22.646 --> 17:24.814
What?

17:24.815 --> 17:27.550
You guys are not

17:27.550 --> 17:29.753
gonna distract me that easy.

17:29.754 --> 17:31.454
Ha ha! Yeah.

17:31.455 --> 17:34.324
- Finklestein!
- <i>(Olafsson laughs)</i>

17:34.325 --> 17:37.594
What natural disaster is your favorite?

17:37.595 --> 17:42.365
- Global warming.
- (crowd gasps)

17:42.366 --> 17:45.501
- Wow. That's brutal.
- Yeah.

17:52.409 --> 17:54.777
More beer for everybody!

17:56.046 --> 18:00.183
You were so nice.

18:00.184 --> 18:02.252
Oh, God, I need a mirror.

18:02.253 --> 18:05.155
My flesh bag is a leaky mess.

18:05.156 --> 18:07.223
- Mirror? Yes.
- Yeah.

18:07.224 --> 18:08.525
No, not for you,

18:08.526 --> 18:10.694
um, because you look great.

18:10.695 --> 18:12.996
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.
You stay here.

18:12.997 --> 18:14.260
Don't let the man get you down.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.027
I'll be right back. Okay, okay.

18:25.108 --> 18:27.943
(rumbling)

18:30.814 --> 18:33.483
Okay. Fingers crossed...

18:33.484 --> 18:37.587
Jenkins put the same transmission
frequency into these

18:37.588 --> 18:42.291
as he does into everything else.

18:45.762 --> 18:48.231
You could help, you know.

18:48.232 --> 18:51.001
Can't. I have to hold this egg.

18:51.002 --> 18:52.968
No, Jenkins! Fire bad.

18:54.471 --> 18:56.039
There's no end in sight.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.707
You sure there isn't a closer door?

18:57.708 --> 18:59.051
Colonel, there isn't another door

18:59.052 --> 19:01.277
within 50 miles of this ice cave.

19:01.278 --> 19:02.501
If you would please step back.

19:02.502 --> 19:04.147
This might get a little toasty.

19:04.148 --> 19:07.282
Don't worry, you're gonna
stay nice and warm.

19:14.057 --> 19:15.624
Ow!

19:22.198 --> 19:25.368
Hey.

19:25.369 --> 19:29.105
I wanted to apologize for
getting teary out there.

19:29.106 --> 19:31.074
You... you were just...

19:31.075 --> 19:32.876
you're so easy to talk to.

19:32.877 --> 19:36.079
Oh, okay. No problem.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.314
First your brother, then you.

19:38.315 --> 19:43.018
God, there's something
about the Finklesteins.

19:44.354 --> 19:47.357
I'm probably jet-lagged.

19:47.358 --> 19:49.893
After the ceremony,
I will feel so much better.

19:49.894 --> 19:52.896
The ceremony. So what exactly is that?

19:52.897 --> 19:54.697
That's where we consume the crystal.

19:54.698 --> 19:57.500
You know, the whole reason we're here.

19:57.501 --> 19:59.636
Right, the crystal.

19:59.637 --> 20:02.972
<i>They've already gone out
with the snowcat to get it.</i>

20:02.973 --> 20:07.577
<i>God, we used to kill each
other over this thing.</i>

20:07.578 --> 20:09.712
But the truce made it more civilized.

20:09.713 --> 20:11.181
We all get to share.

20:11.182 --> 20:13.016
<i>I mean, some of us
still miss the hunts.</i>

20:13.017 --> 20:15.885
Even now the Angrboda crystal calls.

20:15.886 --> 20:19.289
<i>(sighs) Can't you feel it?</i>

20:19.290 --> 20:20.990
Yep.

20:20.991 --> 20:22.658
Sure can.

20:23.769 --> 20:26.038
When Thomas Aquinas said,

20:26.039 --> 20:27.806
"There's nothing on this earth

20:27.807 --> 20:32.545
to be more prized
than true friendship,"

20:32.546 --> 20:34.513
he didn't know about indoor heating!

20:34.514 --> 20:36.414
(all laughing)

20:38.884 --> 20:41.120
Come on!

20:41.121 --> 20:42.987
Drinks are on me!

20:46.091 --> 20:49.628
Cool. I'll killing it.

20:49.629 --> 20:51.597
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

20:51.598 --> 20:53.966
I'm making the best of a bad situation

20:53.967 --> 20:57.269
- until the storm blows over.
- A bad situation?

20:57.270 --> 20:59.405
Oh, that's cool. That sounds fun.

20:59.406 --> 21:01.674
Tell me, you happen to notice anything,

21:01.675 --> 21:05.144
oh, I don't know, odd
about any of your friends?

21:05.145 --> 21:06.645
Well, I mean, they're a little weird,

21:06.646 --> 21:08.509
but you have to understand
where I come from...

21:08.510 --> 21:12.578
Crowd: <i>Finklestein!</i>

21:15.588 --> 21:17.456
Okay. Okay.

21:17.457 --> 21:19.558
- That actually makes a lot of sense.
- Ya think?

21:19.559 --> 21:21.493
- We gotta get outta here.
- Okay.

21:21.494 --> 21:23.798
Okay, well, I've got good news
and bad news on that front.

21:23.799 --> 21:26.966
I managed to connect the
goggles to a bathroom mirror.

21:26.967 --> 21:28.500
I think I got through to the Library,

21:28.501 --> 21:29.868
but the connection fried.

21:29.869 --> 21:31.470
I don't know, European outlets...

21:31.471 --> 21:33.539
All right, what's the good news?

21:33.540 --> 21:36.809
The bad news is that that entire
convention of demons out there

21:36.810 --> 21:38.143
is trying to get the crystal

21:38.144 --> 21:39.727
which is currently embedded in my chest

21:39.728 --> 21:41.480
and makes me light up
like a glow stick.

21:41.481 --> 21:43.015
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right.

21:43.016 --> 21:45.417
So when Meredith said
the word "Angrboda crystal,"

21:45.418 --> 21:48.887
my chest lit up, and, yeah,

21:48.888 --> 21:50.755
so that's happening.

21:54.193 --> 21:56.395
She also said they consume it.

21:56.396 --> 21:58.297
Do you think that means
that they're gonna...

21:58.298 --> 22:01.300
Well, considering I just saw a guy
drink a gallon of beer in one sip,

22:01.301 --> 22:02.924
I think it's in the
realm of possibility.

22:02.925 --> 22:04.303
What are we gonna do?

22:04.304 --> 22:06.105
We can't get out of here
because of the storm,

22:06.106 --> 22:08.369
and if we stay here, it sounds
like they're gonna eat me.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.575
It faded. It faded.

22:09.576 --> 22:12.111
Maybe for good. Maybe.

22:12.112 --> 22:15.014
I am not willing to take that chance.

22:15.015 --> 22:16.348
What if I use, I don't know,

22:16.349 --> 22:17.692
a suppression spell or something?

22:17.693 --> 22:19.818
No, no, no. No magic.

22:19.819 --> 22:21.720
I'm telling you, she was inside,

22:21.721 --> 22:23.756
like, in a bathroom or something.

22:23.757 --> 22:25.457
And that's it? That's all you saw?

22:25.458 --> 22:27.693
No, I'm withholding pertinent
information for fun.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.361
Of course that's all I saw.

22:29.362 --> 22:31.465
Then you could not have been
paying proper attention.

22:31.466 --> 22:32.898
I'm not paying proper attention?

22:32.899 --> 22:34.980
Do you know what I've been
doing on my phone all day?

22:34.981 --> 22:36.444
I've been tracking weather patterns,

22:36.445 --> 22:38.666
and this storm came out of nowhere.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.710
No weather patterns could create this.

22:44.711 --> 22:48.213
Which means this storm is magical.

22:48.214 --> 22:49.957
Okay, what do we really
know about this job?

22:49.958 --> 22:52.959
It was written in the
appointment book by whom?

22:55.254 --> 22:58.390
- You've been tracking weather patterns?
- Yeah.

22:58.391 --> 23:00.054
I wanted to make sure
I wasn't missing out

23:00.055 --> 23:01.393
on any good snowboarding, so...

23:01.394 --> 23:03.829
It was written by the Librarian

23:03.830 --> 23:06.532
Gustav Von Erickson 600 years ago.

23:06.533 --> 23:09.034
Famous Swedish historian,

23:09.035 --> 23:11.603
brilliant on his writing
of Norse mythology,

23:11.604 --> 23:13.739
also famous for his
appalling handwriting.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.574
Little known fact,

23:15.575 --> 23:17.696
he's the reason Gutenberg
invented the printing press.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.431
Did he write anything about this storm?

23:19.432 --> 23:21.962
No, he did not. Just the
location of the ice cave,

23:21.963 --> 23:27.118
this set date, and "Prime
frost, crystal in the ice."

23:29.121 --> 23:30.756
Wait.

23:30.757 --> 23:33.526
If you hadn't used a spell
to open the thing

23:33.527 --> 23:34.793
in the first place,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

23:34.794 --> 23:36.395
If I had used an algorithm,
you wouldn't be this upset.

23:36.396 --> 23:38.932
That's right, in math we
use symbology and formulas

23:38.933 --> 23:40.432
to get to derivatives and absolutes.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.169
- It's the exact same thing as magic.
- How is that even...

23:42.170 --> 23:43.490
It is different! It is dangerous.

23:43.491 --> 23:45.194
You know what people
thought was dangerous?

23:45.195 --> 23:46.772
Fire, technology, chemistry.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.465
Yeah, they thought they were all magic

23:48.466 --> 23:50.209
until they learned
how to use them properly.

23:50.210 --> 23:52.711
You don't know how to use magic.

23:52.712 --> 23:55.247
You don't, all right?

23:55.248 --> 23:57.349
Not well enough to keep
people from getting hurt.

23:57.350 --> 23:59.017
Oh, no one's been hurt.

23:59.018 --> 24:01.787
- You have!
- I am not fragile.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.156
I am trying to make the
best of a bad situation,

24:04.157 --> 24:05.491
just like you are!

24:05.492 --> 24:07.926
I don't think you're fragile.

24:07.927 --> 24:09.895
I think you're too smart

24:09.896 --> 24:11.430
to be this reckless.

24:11.431 --> 24:13.832
If we can't contact the Library,

24:13.833 --> 24:15.300
then we're braving this storm.

24:15.301 --> 24:17.936
But, first, put this on.

24:17.937 --> 24:19.972
- Terrible idea.
- Watch.

24:19.973 --> 24:21.306
- Terrible?
- What are you doing?

24:21.307 --> 24:23.642
Watch this. Angrboda.

24:23.643 --> 24:25.778
Not everything has to
be solved with magic.

24:25.779 --> 24:28.914
Oh, well, at least
I won't be frostbitten.

24:28.915 --> 24:30.649
What did you just say?

24:30.650 --> 24:32.584
I said, at least I won't be cold.

24:32.585 --> 24:36.855
No. Frosty.

24:36.856 --> 24:39.323
I think I know who these guys are.

24:42.461 --> 24:46.398
It's the Jötnar. They're frost giants.

24:46.399 --> 24:49.101
When Von Erickson wrote "prime frost,"

24:49.102 --> 24:50.502
it wasn't a "P".

24:50.503 --> 24:54.106
It was an Elder Futhark rune,

24:54.107 --> 24:57.142
"Thurs," long associated
with the frost giants...

24:57.143 --> 24:59.278
a race of Norse gods, troublemakers,

24:59.279 --> 25:01.246
their most famous ancestor being Loki.

25:01.247 --> 25:03.315
They must have been
after the crystal, too.

25:03.316 --> 25:06.251
No. They must be
after the crystal, too.

25:06.252 --> 25:09.288
So what are they? Gods?

25:09.289 --> 25:11.857
They were creatures who
were worshipped as gods.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.859
But as their age of worship ended,

25:13.860 --> 25:16.795
they segued into the general
human misery business,

25:16.796 --> 25:19.498
drawing pleasure and profit
from seeing people suffer.

25:19.499 --> 25:22.868
Frost giants can be grotesque,
have huge appetites,

25:22.869 --> 25:25.671
and some have weather
control capabilities.

25:25.672 --> 25:27.239
And they're using it
to hide themselves.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.041
If Cassandra and Stone are with them,

25:29.042 --> 25:31.343
they're in far more danger
than just this storm.

25:31.344 --> 25:33.007
Stone: <i>All we gotta do
is cross this room,</i>

25:33.008 --> 25:34.880
grab our gear,
and get out those two doors.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.824
How are we gonna do that
with everyone out there?

25:36.825 --> 25:38.328
Obviously, you've never been in a bar

25:38.329 --> 25:40.519
when the Sooners are
playing Oklahoma State.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.086
Follow me.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.653
How you doing? We got some
catching up to do, me and you.

25:47.654 --> 25:49.795
All right. Knock that
down, brother, huh?

25:49.796 --> 25:51.296
I'll see you cats at the sauna.

25:51.297 --> 25:54.066
Lookin' good, babe. Nice flesh bag.

25:54.067 --> 25:56.434
All right, nice flesh...

26:01.907 --> 26:04.476
Couldn't wait to see it, could you?

26:04.477 --> 26:05.676
Me neither.

26:12.084 --> 26:17.756
Clans of the Jötnar, I welcome you.

26:17.757 --> 26:19.424
We have come together

26:19.425 --> 26:21.560
in this time and place,

26:21.561 --> 26:24.229
to partake of the life
restoring benefits

26:24.230 --> 26:27.466
found within this ice.

26:27.467 --> 26:31.970
Every 600 years,
the Angrboda crystal regrows,

26:31.971 --> 26:34.306
and every 600 years,

26:34.307 --> 26:38.176
we used to fight and
kill each other over it.

26:38.177 --> 26:40.746
But ever since the peace accords,

26:40.747 --> 26:44.283
we have been able to
share and share alike.

26:44.284 --> 26:47.452
And the power and the influence

26:47.453 --> 26:49.654
of the Jötnar only grows!

26:57.329 --> 27:03.334
And now... now we renew
ourselves once again.

27:23.255 --> 27:24.923
Who are you?

27:24.924 --> 27:27.526
Me?

27:27.527 --> 27:29.326
I'm Finklestein.

27:33.737 --> 27:37.073
But if you're Finklestein,
then who is that?

27:37.074 --> 27:38.675
An interloper!

27:38.676 --> 27:41.077
Someone who's here to keep
the crystal for himself.

27:41.078 --> 27:42.652
Norman: <i>A false Finklestein?</i>

27:42.653 --> 27:45.454
I am not a false Finklestein.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.925
- He is the false Finklestein.
- Yeah!

27:48.926 --> 27:51.961
- Grab them.
- Man: <i>Grab them!</i>

27:51.962 --> 27:55.698
First of all...
hey, Olafsson! Olafsson!

27:55.699 --> 27:57.265
Olafsson!

28:01.537 --> 28:03.573
Okay. Hey! Hey! Hey!

28:03.574 --> 28:06.275
I've known Finklestein
for 10,000 years.

28:06.276 --> 28:09.145
I know him better
than anybody else here.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.614
So if you're him,

28:11.615 --> 28:16.719
you need to convince me.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.087
First question,

28:18.088 --> 28:19.956
how come I didn't know
you had a sister?

28:19.957 --> 28:23.793
Olafsson, come on.
You knew I had a sister.

28:23.794 --> 28:26.062
- No I didn't.
- <i>Yes, you did.</i>

28:26.063 --> 28:29.098
You remember, I was born out
of my father's left armpit,

28:29.099 --> 28:31.000
and my sister came from his right.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.584
And then our little
eight-headed brother

28:32.585 --> 28:33.469
came out of his feet.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.271
But this is written history!

28:35.272 --> 28:38.808
Just because I don't
talk about my sister,

28:38.809 --> 28:40.409
doesn't mean she doesn't exist.

28:40.410 --> 28:43.112
You talk about your family in Niflheim,

28:43.113 --> 28:45.414
the land of legendary mist and ice? No.

28:45.415 --> 28:48.217
When's the last time
you went ice skating

28:48.218 --> 28:50.152
on the river Élivágar?

28:50.153 --> 28:52.021
Hmm? We've been friends so long

28:52.022 --> 28:53.789
I don't have to ask
these stupid questions.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.558
Okay, okay, okay.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.560
Okay.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.161
Okay.

28:59.162 --> 29:03.198
Okay, what were we doing
last time we saw each other?

29:05.468 --> 29:07.703
God, who can remember that?

29:07.704 --> 29:11.607
It was 150 years ago,

29:11.608 --> 29:14.477
which would have been

29:14.478 --> 29:16.846
the cholera outbreak in London!

29:16.847 --> 29:19.282
<i>You wouldn't have missed that.</i>

29:19.283 --> 29:20.916
You love plagues! Who doesn't?

29:20.917 --> 29:22.752
<i>(crowd cheers)</i>

29:22.753 --> 29:25.087
We may have had to speak English

29:25.088 --> 29:27.023
to those Victorians,

29:27.024 --> 29:29.558
<i>but when you and I were alone,</i>

29:29.559 --> 29:31.294
we spoke the old language.

29:31.295 --> 29:32.995
The good stuff.

29:32.996 --> 29:36.832
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

29:36.833 --> 29:40.436
Okay. All right. Final question.

29:40.437 --> 29:42.371
How long have we been friends?

29:42.372 --> 29:43.939
We've been friends forever.

29:43.940 --> 29:46.175
Since we were kids...
little frost giants

29:46.176 --> 29:47.943
<i>just causing trouble.</i>

29:47.944 --> 29:51.714
Olafsson and Finklestein.
Finklestein and Olafsson.

29:51.715 --> 29:57.653
Uh, we were never friends!

29:57.654 --> 29:59.488
You were always jealous of me.

29:59.489 --> 30:02.658
The Viking warriors always
paid more fealty to me

30:02.659 --> 30:06.095
because they liked me better,
and that made you crazy.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.596
Well, you bribed them!

30:07.597 --> 30:10.333
You said they'd cross oceans
if they prayed to you.

30:10.334 --> 30:11.801
- They did!
- Oh!

30:11.802 --> 30:13.069
And you remember that girl?

30:13.070 --> 30:15.037
- That girl from China?
- Oh! Oh!

30:15.038 --> 30:18.474
She liked me better.
They all liked me better.

30:18.475 --> 30:20.476
You know what? You are a no good,

30:20.477 --> 30:23.278
low down, slimy eel!

30:25.815 --> 30:27.550
That's the real Finklestein.

30:27.551 --> 30:28.817
Grab them!

30:31.187 --> 30:33.089
So somewhere in this snowstorm

30:33.090 --> 30:36.025
is a building the frost
giants conjured magically.

30:36.026 --> 30:38.094
- Jenkins.
- Hmm?

30:38.095 --> 30:40.863
Does this computer

30:40.864 --> 30:42.665
have some sort of
heat signature setting

30:42.666 --> 30:44.667
- or something?
- That's what it's on.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.063
It's on heat signature settings.

30:46.064 --> 30:48.337
Because of the storm,
there is no heat to register.

30:48.338 --> 30:50.005
Not those kind of heat signatures.

30:50.006 --> 30:51.707
Like, magical signatures.

30:51.708 --> 30:55.211
- No satellite can track magic.
- Maybe not.

30:55.212 --> 30:57.513
Colonel, do you think
DOSA has a satellite?

30:57.514 --> 30:59.275
They've been following
magic for a while now.

30:59.276 --> 31:01.143
They must know what
kind of trail it leaves.

31:01.144 --> 31:03.886
We've got tracking equipment.
Why can't they?

31:03.887 --> 31:05.621
Yes, and there's
will be military grade.

31:05.622 --> 31:07.857
- Yeah, but...
- Wait. Wait.

31:07.858 --> 31:09.625
Ezekiel, we're following
your lead on this.

31:09.626 --> 31:12.494
No, no. Cassie! Cassie!

31:15.898 --> 31:19.068
Okay, okay, Okay, okay! Yes, we lied.

31:19.069 --> 31:20.803
But there's some very
good reasons for that.

31:20.804 --> 31:24.573
Very good reasons, which are...
we're the Librarians.

31:24.574 --> 31:27.143
You're Librarians? That is not awesome.

31:27.144 --> 31:29.578
Last time, a Librarian tried
to wreck our ceremony, too.

31:29.579 --> 31:32.181
I told you. They just want
the crystal for themselves.

31:32.182 --> 31:35.084
Okay, maybe we do want
the crystal for ourselves.

31:35.085 --> 31:37.353
- We're not the only one.
- No, we're not the only ones.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.789
Yes, we went to the cave, yes,

31:39.790 --> 31:41.390
and we were looking for the crystal.

31:41.391 --> 31:43.526
Someone else was there, too.

31:43.527 --> 31:47.396
Someone that did not want to
share the power with you guys.

31:47.397 --> 31:50.900
Ring a bell, Finklestein?

31:50.901 --> 31:54.503
Why were you late? Our kind
knows their way around a storm.

31:54.504 --> 31:57.940
I got stuck in traffic.

31:57.941 --> 32:00.109
He was late because,
well, I was beating him up.

32:00.110 --> 32:02.244
I was not getting beaten up by you.

32:02.245 --> 32:08.150
If... if I was going after
the crystal on my own,

32:08.151 --> 32:10.986
then why would I have
shown up here now?

32:10.987 --> 32:13.856
Maybe he already has it on him?

32:13.857 --> 32:16.292
Okay. Okay. Oh. Ha!

32:16.293 --> 32:17.827
No! Stop it! That tickles.

32:17.828 --> 32:19.528
You see? It was him.

32:19.529 --> 32:22.665
He was at the caves and he was
going after the Angrboda crystal,

32:22.666 --> 32:24.967
and you all should all
be ashamed of yourselves

32:24.968 --> 32:26.936
with your jealously
and your infighting.

32:26.937 --> 32:28.903
And my chest is glowing, isn't it?

32:34.087 --> 32:36.956
Uh, little to the left.

32:36.957 --> 32:41.494
More left. Less left.

32:41.495 --> 32:43.296
- <i>Less left.</i>
- Yes, yes, yes.

32:43.297 --> 32:45.905
We're past less left
and now more right.

32:45.906 --> 32:50.609
I'm not disrupting satellite
signals using brute force, okay?

32:50.610 --> 32:52.411
I'm hacking into DOSA and mirroring

32:52.412 --> 32:53.979
its satellite data and its controls.

32:53.980 --> 32:55.681
- This is delicate.
- If anyone can do it,

32:55.682 --> 32:59.785
- you can.
- Oh, I know, but thanks.

32:59.786 --> 33:03.322
This here is the magical storm.

33:03.323 --> 33:05.386
The snowstorm is magical,
so it's completely lit up.

33:05.387 --> 33:07.356
But they have no idea
how to narrow it down.

33:07.357 --> 33:08.261
Can we narrow it down?

33:08.262 --> 33:11.363
When magic is created, it carries
a signature of its creator

33:11.364 --> 33:13.499
akin to a fingerprint.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.602
If we could isolate Cassandra's
signature within all of this data,

33:16.603 --> 33:18.907
we could locate her, and then
I could send the door there.

33:18.908 --> 33:19.972
So how do we do that?

33:19.973 --> 33:21.674
Well, we need to have something

33:21.675 --> 33:23.576
that we know that Cassandra
performed magic on

33:23.577 --> 33:26.210
within the last 24 hour...

33:33.085 --> 33:34.620
Meredith, please help me.

33:34.621 --> 33:37.056
Is this really necessary?

33:37.057 --> 33:38.891
It kind of is.

33:38.892 --> 33:41.160
I'm sorry. I would have
loved to hang out.

33:41.161 --> 33:42.661
But on the bright side,

33:42.662 --> 33:44.797
we haven't had a human
sacrifice in forever.

33:44.798 --> 33:46.631
It's gonna be a real treat.

33:48.534 --> 33:51.337
Clans of the Jötnar, I welcome you.

33:51.338 --> 33:53.939
We have come together
in this place and time...

33:53.940 --> 33:57.042
Are you seriously gonna
do the whole speech?

33:57.043 --> 34:00.479
Olafsson: <i>Ceremony is important.</i>

34:00.480 --> 34:02.134
<i>Always trying to find a shortcut.</i>

34:02.135 --> 34:03.959
Finklestein: <i>But we're
not opening up the ice.</i>

34:03.960 --> 34:05.451
<i>We're opening up the girl.</i>

34:05.452 --> 34:07.453
<i>We don't need any of your fancy words.</i>

34:07.454 --> 34:09.388
Hey, Olafsson?

34:09.389 --> 34:13.058
Want some fancy words?
How about Dylan Thomas?

34:13.059 --> 34:16.027
"Do not go gentle
into that good night."

34:16.029 --> 34:17.929
Don't need your help, Librarian.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.132
All right, well, how about McKay?

34:20.132 --> 34:22.534
"Though far outnumbered,
let us show us brave,

34:22.534 --> 34:25.437
and for their thousand blows,
deal one deathblow."

34:25.438 --> 34:27.505
Don't worry, you'll get your deathblow.

34:27.507 --> 34:29.208
How about Cillian?

34:29.208 --> 34:34.045
"Magic can be used as a tool...

34:34.047 --> 34:36.614
and I have a little faith."

34:37.683 --> 34:41.420
<i>De antiquis invoco deos.</i>

34:41.420 --> 34:44.489
<i>Quia opus factum est.</i>

34:44.491 --> 34:46.290
<i>Ut quietam.</i>

34:50.529 --> 34:51.763
Do something!

34:59.805 --> 35:02.273
Stop her!

35:10.149 --> 35:12.150
I told you, you got a weak left.

35:15.187 --> 35:16.155
Oh, oh.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.424
Put... stretch it.

35:21.860 --> 35:24.296
Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit.

35:24.297 --> 35:25.497
You're doing great.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.131
Come on, guys. Any time.

35:37.609 --> 35:39.677
Ha! There.

35:46.919 --> 35:48.654
Colonel! Not with the connection.

35:48.655 --> 35:50.118
It's unstable. You can't go through.

35:50.119 --> 35:51.585
But can they?

35:53.325 --> 35:54.425
Upstairs, upstairs.

36:00.466 --> 36:02.633
Come on!

36:09.441 --> 36:11.809
Go!

36:25.324 --> 36:27.326
- You think that'll hold them?
- I don't know.

36:27.327 --> 36:28.761
If you've got one of your ideas

36:28.762 --> 36:30.385
about how to get us
miraculously rescued,

36:30.386 --> 36:31.930
right now would be the time.

36:31.931 --> 36:33.999
Baird: <i>Cassandra? Stone?</i>

36:34.000 --> 36:35.634
Baird!

36:35.635 --> 36:37.736
Baird: <i>Come on,
the connection's unstable!</i>

36:37.737 --> 36:39.138
<i>You need to move.</i>

36:39.139 --> 36:42.374
- You go.
- No, we got together.

36:42.375 --> 36:43.708
Go!

37:02.945 --> 37:04.781
The vibrations.

37:04.782 --> 37:08.518
The hotel is a manifestation
of the storm.

37:08.519 --> 37:10.920
It's constantly moving. That's
why they can't get a lock.

37:10.921 --> 37:12.522
How do we get through?

37:12.523 --> 37:14.357
Baird: <i>Guys! Guys!</i>

37:14.358 --> 37:16.559
We gotta catch it.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.727
Before they catch us!

37:17.728 --> 37:19.729
Baird: <i>Over here!</i>

37:19.730 --> 37:21.230
This is not working.

37:21.231 --> 37:22.632
They can't hold the door
because they're looking

37:22.633 --> 37:24.234
for a stationary point
in a moving space.

37:24.235 --> 37:26.138
They need to track
a succession of moving points

37:26.139 --> 37:27.970
to get a pattern of motion.

37:27.971 --> 37:28.545
Baird!

37:28.546 --> 37:30.327
Tell Jenkins to get a
lock on the elevator!

37:31.674 --> 37:34.242
Baird: <i>Elevator? What?</i>

37:36.479 --> 37:38.081
Elevator. Elevator!

37:38.082 --> 37:39.582
Norman, go around the other way.

37:39.583 --> 37:40.682
- Yeah!
- Come on.

37:43.519 --> 37:45.554
Come on, come on.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.162
That crystal is ours!

37:53.163 --> 37:54.948
You gotta have a little faith, right?

38:00.937 --> 38:02.604
Close the door! Close the door!

38:05.174 --> 38:07.475
So, how was your day?

38:09.712 --> 38:11.347
Finklestein,

38:11.348 --> 38:14.817
how did that Librarian
know you had a weak left?

38:14.818 --> 38:17.754
Well, I...

38:17.755 --> 38:19.689
You were gonna steal
the crystal and not share.

38:19.690 --> 38:21.758
- It's his fault.
- My fault?

38:21.759 --> 38:23.426
I wouldn't have gone after the crystal

38:23.427 --> 38:26.395
if you hadn't been so stingy
with my share the last time.

38:26.396 --> 38:28.463
Truce over!

38:40.543 --> 38:43.646
- Salve for your rope burns.
- Thanks.

38:43.647 --> 38:47.515
Considering what we were up
against, I'm getting off easy.

38:49.652 --> 38:53.121
You got through it like Librarians.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.161
And you got through it, too.

38:58.162 --> 38:59.796
I hesitate to give you more praise,

38:59.797 --> 39:01.164
- but if I'm...
- Shh!

39:01.165 --> 39:03.866
And the moment's over.

39:03.867 --> 39:07.470
So does having this crystal
inside me make me immortal now?

39:07.471 --> 39:09.172
Ah, well, no.

39:09.173 --> 39:10.740
According to Von Erickson's notes,

39:10.741 --> 39:15.678
unless you're a Norse god
or related to one...

39:15.679 --> 39:20.416
Well, then the crystal should pass
through your system in due time.

39:20.417 --> 39:21.584
Wait, when you say "pass"...

39:21.585 --> 39:22.951
Do you like prune juice?

39:27.456 --> 39:30.659
Sounds like I'm gonna have
a rough couple days.

39:34.530 --> 39:36.231
You're still mad I used magic?

39:38.835 --> 39:42.071
You know, we stepped through a broom
closet and ended up in Sweden.

39:42.072 --> 39:46.576
We tell people that we're
Librarians, and they let us in.

39:46.577 --> 39:48.744
Magic helps us do what we do.

39:48.745 --> 39:51.012
Magic's what saved the day.

39:52.548 --> 39:54.849
It can't be all that bad.

39:58.120 --> 40:01.023
I know that,

40:01.024 --> 40:03.526
and I'm amazed at what you've learned,

40:03.527 --> 40:05.895
what you can do.

40:05.896 --> 40:07.396
But it worries me,

40:07.397 --> 40:11.434
Because it's the not bad parts

40:11.435 --> 40:13.102
that make people think
that the bad parts

40:13.103 --> 40:14.669
really aren't that bad.

40:17.340 --> 40:20.209
That's dangerous.

40:20.210 --> 40:23.378
Yeah, magic got us
out of trouble today.

40:24.847 --> 40:27.182
But it's also what put us in it, too.

40:32.521 --> 40:33.755
Point taken.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.563
- (cracking)
- Jenkins! It's happening!

40:50.072 --> 40:51.873
Uh, it's crack...

40:55.444 --> 40:57.145
Okay. Yes.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.955
Jenkins: <i>Oh, well, Mr. Jones,</i>

41:05.956 --> 41:09.325
I do believe it has
just imprinted on you.

41:09.326 --> 41:13.129
You are now its de facto mother.

41:13.130 --> 41:15.564
And quite honestly, I do
believe it could do worse.

41:15.565 --> 41:18.134
Wow. Looks like I'm not the only one

41:18.135 --> 41:20.135
putting faith in Ezekiel Jones.
