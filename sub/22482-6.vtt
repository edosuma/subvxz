WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:06.006
You lose something?

00:07.508 --> 00:09.177
Oh, come on.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.178
You're still not talking to me?

00:10.211 --> 00:11.745
I said I was sorry.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.582
(sighs)
You know, I don't mind

00:14.615 --> 00:16.417
that you borrow my car
without asking.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.319
I don't mind that
you never put gas in it.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.421
I don't even mind that
I have to pull my seat up

00:20.454 --> 00:21.789
all the way from Freaktown.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.127
But when I turn on the radio and
you've changed all my stations,

00:26.160 --> 00:27.495
that's when I snap.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.631
Hey, when I hear Kenny G,
that's when I snap.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.501
Where are you going?

00:33.534 --> 00:36.504
Oh, I'm just heading out
for a little bit.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.172
Where?
Got a thing.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.408
What thing?
I'm meeting a guy for a beer.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.510
BONNIE: Who?
You don't know him.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.512
Where are you going?
Who are you meeting?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.080
CHRISTY:
Surrender

00:46.114 --> 00:48.349
or before you know it,
you're a year older.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.219
My brother's in town.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.221
You have a brother?

00:53.254 --> 00:55.523
This is gonna make me
late for work,

00:55.556 --> 00:57.425
but it's worth it.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.194
Why am I not meeting him?

01:00.228 --> 01:02.263
Maybe Adam's ashamed of you.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.764
Hey.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.367
You're not talking to me,
Smooth Jazz.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.804
Tell me why I shouldn't be
incredibly hurt right now.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.473
We're not that close.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.475
The only reason I'm seeing him
is to sign some papers

01:14.508 --> 01:16.177
for our parents' estate.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.246
Estate?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.447
Don't get excited.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.549
It's a thousand bucks a year.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.251
Why my parents
decided to dole it out

01:23.284 --> 01:25.253
until I'm 85 remains a mystery.

01:25.286 --> 01:29.157
Still, uh, after you've gone,
that grand goes to me?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.458
Go nuts.

01:33.294 --> 01:36.164
I'm an heiress.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.166
Adam, a hint.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.900
Sleep with your eyes open.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.569
Already do.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.337
I'll see you later.
Wait.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.339
Why can't I meet him?

01:45.373 --> 01:46.907
What, was he born
without a nose?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.809
Weird, floaty eye?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.178
Spits when he says,

01:50.211 --> 01:52.280
(spitting):
"sauteed spinach."

01:52.313 --> 01:55.249
Yes, it's all of those things.
Can I go now?

01:55.283 --> 01:58.619
No. I am meeting him
and that's final.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.323
I'm not gonna win this, am I?

02:02.356 --> 02:03.591
You gave up those balls

02:03.624 --> 02:05.293
the minute you put a ring
on her finger.

02:05.326 --> 02:10.298
BONNIE: Give me
five minutes to change.

02:10.331 --> 02:13.267
First the legs, now you guys.

02:13.301 --> 02:16.204
The darkness is moving north.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.406
*

02:32.753 --> 02:34.188
Here you go, Bonnie.
Well, thank you, Patrick.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.022
How gallant.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.193
Sure beats a beer
in my hotel lobby.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.362
You're gonna love it.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.730
Oh, waitress.

02:44.765 --> 02:48.469
God, I hate her.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.904
Welcome to the Rustic Fig.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.840
The one place
I used to feel safe.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.543
(laughs)
I told you, she's a pistol.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.278
Wish I had one right now.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.380
Hey, Christy.
I'm Patrick.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.614
Really nice to meet you.
Hi.
Hi.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.750
Since Patrick's only in town
for the night, we thought we...

03:02.783 --> 03:05.653
She thought.
...we'd come here.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.356
What better way for us all
to get to know each other?

03:08.389 --> 03:10.624
With me serving
you food. Yay.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.527
Can I please have
whatever kind of beer

03:13.561 --> 03:15.363
can get here fastest?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.330
Can you make that two?

03:16.364 --> 03:17.631
But take your time.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.536
And I'll have, let me see...

03:22.570 --> 03:25.573
uh...

03:25.606 --> 03:28.676
What's in a virgin mojito?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.779
Lime juice, cane sugar
and my thumb.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.614
I'll have a water.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.385
Patrick, I'm so glad
we're doing this.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.420
Oh, me, too. I didn't
even know you existed.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.388
I didn't know you existed.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.855
You both exist.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.424
Should we figure out
what we're gonna eat?

03:43.457 --> 03:45.293
Charming as ever, dude.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.760
Bite the big one, Pat.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.897
What fun.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.402
Oh, I'm getting a picture
of the two of you

03:54.435 --> 03:55.603
growing up together.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.770
Roughhousing

03:56.804 --> 03:58.406
out at the lake.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.773
I don't know. Was there a lake?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.709
There was an ocean.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.911
In fact,
Adam taught me to surf.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.746
Man, you sure ran with that one.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.047
What does that mean?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.749
I own a company
that makes surfboards.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.651
Wow, didn't waste any time
squeezing that one

04:10.684 --> 04:11.985
into the conversation.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.587
Okay, why don't we talk about

04:13.621 --> 04:16.324
how you hung out
with Russell Crowe?

04:17.858 --> 04:19.860
He does work that one in a lot.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.464
We got drunk in Prague.
He threw a phone at me.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.333
It's a good story.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.401
The first seven times,
am I right?

04:27.435 --> 04:29.337
(laughs)

04:30.638 --> 04:32.840
I hear something different
every time.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.378
Okay, two beers

04:37.411 --> 04:39.447
and one tap water

04:39.480 --> 04:42.316
with a splash of spit.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.085
Well, we definitely
want appetizers.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.487
What do you recommend?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.589
Going to a different restaurant.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.691
Oh, Christy.
(laughing)

04:52.059 --> 04:53.361
Tell me about the crab cakes.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.829
No.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.373
Your brother seems
like a nice guy.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.941
Where in the world
did you get that?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.843
Well, he paid for dinner

05:09.877 --> 05:11.779
while you were being
a dick all night.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.414
That was my takeaway.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.682
I don't like the guy.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.484
I thought you might have
picked up on that

05:16.517 --> 05:18.386
when I told you
I don't like the guy.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.820
Oh, come on.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.355
How many times did
Christy tell everyone

05:21.389 --> 05:23.357
she hated me at dinner tonight?

05:23.391 --> 05:25.125
It's just something people say.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.395
At least it's over.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.962
I never have
to see him again.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.665
Yikes. What happened
with you guys?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.534
He bang your prom date?

05:33.567 --> 05:37.070
Women aren't that
important to me.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.072
Stare all you want;
I'm not taking it back.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.408
Ugh.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.576
It's not fair.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.413
I parade my dirty family laundry
in front of you every day.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.980
You owe me this.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.549
All right, fine.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.084
That surfboard company, my idea.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.654
I worked there.
I helped get it started,

05:53.687 --> 05:54.988
but did he cut me in
on the profits

05:55.022 --> 05:56.156
once it became a success?

05:56.189 --> 05:57.858
I'm guessing no.
Nothing.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.159
Well, that's ridiculous.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.061
Those profits should
be ours-- yours.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.696
Thank you.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.698
God.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.535
You know what really
upset me tonight?
Hmm?

06:07.568 --> 06:10.571
Discovering that my daughter
is a terrible waitress.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.039
I still don't think you
should've complained

06:12.072 --> 06:13.774
to the manager.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.610
How else is she
gonna get better?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.060
Are you eating
garbage cake?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.796
It was untouched.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.865
Anniversary dinner.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.067
He shot her a look
when she ordered the cake.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.802
Things went downhill fast.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.904
Well, in that case,
hand me a fork.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.041
Mm.
Thank you.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.143
This is a surprise.
What brings you back?

06:50.177 --> 06:53.481
Ah, there's nothing good
in my hotel's garbage.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.616
I thought I was coming
back here for a nightcap.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.485
(whispering):
This is so much better.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.620
You sure?
Mmm.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.888
I got half a martini
in here.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.491
Wait. There's
a shrimp tail in it.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.626
(laughs)
No, I'm good.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.896
So, did you survive dinner
with my mother?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.130
Oh, my God, I love her.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.231
She's hilarious.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.866
No more cake for you.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.507
Hey, anybody gives my brother
a hard time is okay by me.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.609
To be perfectly honest,

07:21.642 --> 07:23.677
um, I spent most of dinner

07:23.711 --> 07:26.547
waiting for you to come
back to the table.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.115
Oh, my God.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.818
Are you the one who
complained to my manager?

07:30.851 --> 07:34.588
No, it's just that every time
you came back to the table,

07:34.622 --> 07:37.958
things were... you know,

07:37.991 --> 07:40.894
really good.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.164
(laughing): Sorry.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.633
I'm recently divorced.
I'm a little rusty.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.835
I'm sorry.
Are you flirting with me?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.570
You couldn't tell?

07:49.603 --> 07:52.272
See, this is where
my rustiness comes in.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.707
Ah, newly divorced,
too, huh?

07:53.741 --> 07:55.543
Nope, just good old rust.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.977
(laughs)

07:57.010 --> 08:00.047
Well, um, what I'm
trying to say is, uh,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.282
I'm supposed to be
leaving tomorrow,

08:02.315 --> 08:03.951
and if you happen
to be free tomorrow

08:03.984 --> 08:06.019
and are amenable to what
I'm about to propose,

08:06.053 --> 08:08.589
I was thinking I could
stay an extra night

08:08.622 --> 08:12.793
for the express purpose of
taking you out tomorrow.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.963
Just to be clear,
we're talking about tomorrow?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.198
Yeah. Although
it is midnight,

08:18.231 --> 08:19.833
so tomorrow is now today.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.736
So, uh... (mumbles)
...today.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.673
I'd really like that.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.807
Oh, great. Great.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.075
I'll bring the oil can.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.643
For the rustiness.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.579
You know, Wizard of Oz.
(chuckles)

08:31.612 --> 08:33.180
Not dry vagina.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.720
My God, I...

08:39.753 --> 08:41.555
I just said "dry vagina."

08:41.589 --> 08:44.592
And pointed.
(chuckles)

08:44.625 --> 08:46.760
Okay, what do you think?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.796
Great. Let me see the tush.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.701
Damn it, I used to have
a cute, little booty like that.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.868
You will again.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.103
You already lost six pounds.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.572
Mm, five.
Paid 300 bucks

08:58.606 --> 09:00.708
for some black market licorice
last night.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.211
Hey.
Hey.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.879
Hey, Bonnie.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.581
You heard that, too, right?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.082
It's Jill.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.651
We're Skyping.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.285
You're awfully dressed up
for that.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.055
She's got a date.
Really? With who?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.124
Just a guy.
Adam's brother.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.759
(laughs)
This is fun!

09:18.792 --> 09:21.629
But he left town.

09:21.662 --> 09:25.098
He decided to stay an extra day
just for little old me.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.635
Are you kidding me? You can't
go out with Adam's brother.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.871
And yet I've got my good bra on,
and I'm headed out the door.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.272
No, no, you don't get it.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.941
Adam really doesn't like him.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.945
I don't like you, but we eat
eight meals a week together.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.614
Wait. So why does Adam
not like his brother?

09:40.648 --> 09:42.049
I don't care! He's in town

09:42.082 --> 09:43.817
for one more night,
and he asked me out

09:43.851 --> 09:45.786
like an awkward eighth grader,
so I'm going.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.956
Just so you know, you and
your bra are ruining my life.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.260
Oh, I miss you girls.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.330
Hello?

09:57.364 --> 10:00.333
Am I talking to an empty room?

10:00.367 --> 10:03.136
God, I'm so hungry.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.177
(sportscaster speaking
indistinctly over television)

10:12.713 --> 10:15.683
(clearing throat loudly)

10:19.753 --> 10:21.755
Staircase.

10:22.856 --> 10:23.824
What's going on?

10:23.857 --> 10:28.128
What's going on is
I wanted some quality time

10:28.161 --> 10:29.697
with my man.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.667
Can we do that?
Where's Christy?

10:33.701 --> 10:35.669
She had a date tonight.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.270
Oh, good for her.
You know,

10:37.304 --> 10:38.706
I don't understand
why some guy

10:38.739 --> 10:40.440
hasn't just swept her
off her feet.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.810
Well, I guess that thought
runs in your family,

10:42.843 --> 10:44.778
'cause your brother stayed
an extra day to take her out.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.680
Kiss me.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.018
Bonnie. Bonnie.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.688
Adam. Oh, Adam...

10:54.722 --> 10:58.458
Wait, w-wait.
Hang on a minute.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.327
Christy's on a date
with Patrick?

11:00.360 --> 11:01.729
That's right.
Let's get those pants off.

11:01.762 --> 11:02.896
(stammers)

11:02.930 --> 11:05.332
You know, you did this.
What do you mean?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.000
I was just gonna go out
and have a drink with him

11:07.034 --> 11:08.869
and sign some
papers, but no,

11:08.902 --> 11:10.403
you had to stick
your nose in there

11:10.437 --> 11:11.839
and Bonnie it all up.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.842
Hey, I was gonna
use this mouth

11:14.875 --> 11:16.844
to say I'm sorry,
but it can just as easily

11:16.877 --> 11:17.945
go eat a sandwich.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.751
*

11:25.753 --> 11:28.388
Oh...
Oh...

11:30.457 --> 11:33.727
So, what's your favorite
place to surf?

11:33.761 --> 11:37.765
Ah. Uh... Costa Rica,
probably.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.200
You know, one time I was, um,
waiting for a set to come in

11:40.233 --> 11:42.836
when I realized, suddenly,
that I was surrounded

11:42.870 --> 11:44.204
by dolphins.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.874
Wow, that sounds beautiful.
Ah.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.842
Yeah, it was,
until I realized

11:48.876 --> 11:51.178
the dolphins were
surrounded by sharks,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.781
and that was the moment
I learned I could fly.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.152
I took acid once
and learned I couldn't fly.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.355
Duh...
Oof...

12:02.389 --> 12:04.758
(both groaning)

12:04.792 --> 12:06.794
You know, we've been playing
for 20 minutes,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.228
and neither one of us
has made a shot.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.529
Yeah.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.031
(groaning)

12:11.064 --> 12:12.265
Well, that was pretty close.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.901
Should we just start
counting those?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.904
I'll tell you where
we went wrong.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.972
Not enough blue stuff
on the end of the thing.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.776
Step aside and watch me work.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.312
Okay.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.117
Wow! Whoo!
Oh, my God,
I got one in!

12:30.150 --> 12:32.319
I got one in.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.254
Not the one I wanted, but still.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.990
Toss me that magic blue cube.

12:37.024 --> 12:41.161
We are not leaving
until I sink one, too.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.797
Don't you have to go
back home tomorrow?

12:43.831 --> 12:44.998
(chuckles)

12:45.032 --> 12:46.233
Well, actually,

12:46.266 --> 12:47.500
I'm taking a couple
weeks off

12:47.534 --> 12:49.402
to surf my way
down the coast.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.904
Oh.
(ball drops)

12:50.938 --> 12:52.572
Boy, that sounds great.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.874
Do you surf?

12:53.907 --> 12:55.575
Nope.
I can barely swim.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.510
That's why I don't
take baths.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.813
I mean, I shower.
I'm clean.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.149
Smart, beautiful,
hygienic.

13:02.182 --> 13:05.118
Final box checked.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.829
(man speaking indistinctly
over television)

13:15.863 --> 13:17.965
(sighs)

13:19.466 --> 13:22.870
Oh, God, what now?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.872
Your brother's staying
another week

13:24.905 --> 13:26.907
to be with Christy.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.347
And to your left,
more vineyards.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.850
You picked a hell
of a place to get sober.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.151
I know, right?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.286
Could have moved
to Utah,

13:39.319 --> 13:40.487
but where's
the challenge in that?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.890
Yeah.

13:42.923 --> 13:46.559
Lot of grapes.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.862
What are those, red?

13:48.896 --> 13:52.032
See? It's like
you live here.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.067
Hey, can I ask you something?

13:54.101 --> 13:55.969
Sure.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.038
What's the deal
with you and Adam?

13:58.071 --> 14:00.573
Oh, well, what can I say?

14:00.607 --> 14:03.243
Uh, we used to be really tight.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.879
We started our business
together,

14:05.913 --> 14:08.015
and six months later, he bailed.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.049
Left me high and dry.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.884
Wow.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.252
I can see why you're mad at him,

14:12.285 --> 14:14.187
but what's his problem?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.889
Oh, that's simple.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.958
I made the business
into a success,

14:17.991 --> 14:19.059
and now he's jealous.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.594
That doesn't sound like
the Adam I know.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.663
Well, it's the Adam I know.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.498
But, hey, maybe
your mom's had

14:25.532 --> 14:26.533
a good influence on him.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.906
(Christy laughing)

14:36.076 --> 14:38.611
This is a disaster.
Adam is furious,

14:38.645 --> 14:39.947
and I'm out of lingerie.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.915
But I'm happy.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.217
Isn't that what moms are
supposed to want for their kids?

14:44.251 --> 14:46.053
On what planet?

14:46.086 --> 14:47.454
You are standing
in between me

14:47.487 --> 14:49.256
and a thousand dollars
a year.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.592
You are so selfish.
You are so selfish.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.562
What do you guys think?

14:55.595 --> 14:59.366
Look, they remembered
we're here.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.936
Well, I th...
Da-da-da!

15:02.970 --> 15:05.973
You're obviously only
dating Patrick to annoy me.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.943
No, I am dating Patrick
because he's a nice guy.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.644
Annoying you is
a delightful bonus.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.084
I'm gonna shop for jeans.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.120
I'm confused-- why is Adam
so upset about this?

15:20.153 --> 15:23.423
Because Adam and
Patrick hate each other.
Why?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.625
Why does anyone
ever fight? Money.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.996
Well, maybe you two can
help them patch things up.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.264
You were estranged for years
and found a way to reconnect,

15:31.298 --> 15:32.966
and it's been wonderful.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.135
All right, settle down.
I wouldn't go that far.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.070
Do you guys think
I could pull off overalls?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.371
No.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.977
I'm just saying you
could be a good example

15:44.011 --> 15:44.978
to these boys.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.014
Maybe.
Got to admit,

15:47.047 --> 15:49.316
nobody knows decades
of estrangement

15:49.349 --> 15:51.584
and then a quasi-satisfying
makeup like we do.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.086
Yeah. Of course,
if we had money,

15:53.120 --> 15:54.687
things could get dicey.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.690
If we had money, you'd
be dead by sundown.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.128
(knock on door)

16:01.161 --> 16:03.496
Someone's at the door.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.032
CHRISTY:
I'll get it.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.168
Hey, Adam.
I like that shirt.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.202
Oh, thanks.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.004
Wow, why are you
so dressed up?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.574
Oh, son of a bitch.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.778
Hey.
Hi.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.347
(turns TV off)

16:20.380 --> 16:23.116
Oh. Didn't know you'd be here.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.186
Why wouldn't I be here?
It's my fiancée's house.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.788
And another great talk.
Can we go?

16:28.821 --> 16:32.025
Actually, I was thinking
you could come in for a sec.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.061
Ah...

16:34.094 --> 16:36.196
I take it we're being set up?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.630
Looks like it.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.468
Wow, isn't this
a nice surprise.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.036
They're onto us, Mom.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.172
Then let's just jump right in.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.706
We're trying to help
you two asshats

16:46.739 --> 16:48.175
be more like us.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.742
How is name-calling gonna help?

16:49.776 --> 16:51.378
What'd I say?

16:51.411 --> 16:55.048
Look, nobody's had
more bad water

16:55.082 --> 16:58.051
under the bridge than me
and Amazon Prime over here.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.387
But we got over it.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.522
And if we can,
anyone can.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.691
So, sit.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.127
(mock crying)

17:11.698 --> 17:14.134
Okay, animosities.
Go.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.439
Okay, why don't I help
get the ball rolling?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.374
Patrick, Adam is
upset with you

17:21.408 --> 17:23.710
because you hogged all the
surfboard money for yourself.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.378
What?
Is that what you told her?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.347
Because that's what happened.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.382
No, it's not.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.851
Patrick was just a kid
starting up a business.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.220
You're the one
who bailed on him.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.587
How did I bail on you?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.855
You took off for Hollywood

17:35.888 --> 17:37.690
to start your big
stuntman career.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.227
Hey, the surfboard business
was my idea.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.229
I got it off the ground for you,

17:42.262 --> 17:44.197
and then something good
happened to me. I'm so sorry.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.166
Off the ground?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.401
I worked 16-hour days
without you.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.469
I had to quit school.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.272
Oh, take off your skirt.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.706
Our business was great,

17:53.740 --> 17:55.142
and you didn't share
a dime with me.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.144
Oh, please.
I don't see you for ten years.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.578
How is it still "our" business?

17:58.611 --> 17:59.746
I was working on movies.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.214
I-I was on location.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.216
I'm sorry I wasn't there
to hold your hand.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.285
Kind of a soft argument.
Step it up.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.188
You know,
I started this business

18:08.221 --> 18:10.257
to be with my brother, but since
all you care about is money,

18:10.290 --> 18:12.192
I'm happy to write you a check.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.260
I don't want your money.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.762
(groans)

18:15.795 --> 18:17.264
We're winning. Keep going.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.266
You know, if you wanted
to be with me so badly,

18:19.299 --> 18:20.133
where were you

18:20.167 --> 18:21.134
when this happened?

18:21.168 --> 18:23.270
What?
I was in the hospital
for a year.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.438
Guys I hadn't seen
since high school came by.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.573
You never did.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.741
I wanted to be there.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.842
Then why the hell weren't you?

18:29.876 --> 18:30.843
Because I figured

18:30.877 --> 18:32.912
I was the last person
you'd ever want to see.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.647
Why wouldn't I want to see you?
You're my brother.

18:34.681 --> 18:38.251
If I'd known that,

18:38.285 --> 18:40.520
I'd have been there in a second.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.858
I love you, man.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.200
I love you, too.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.834
Dude.

18:56.869 --> 19:00.473
Now would be the perfect time
to get that check.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.879
How did this happen?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.881
My date's having dinner
with your fiancé,

19:08.915 --> 19:11.551
and I'm having my ninth meal
of the week with you.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.554
Bringing them together
feels good, though, right?

19:14.587 --> 19:16.723
Yeah, it does.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.791
We saved a family tonight.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.262
I'm gonna say this to you
'cause you get it,

19:22.295 --> 19:24.564
but I wouldn't say it out there.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.234
Heroes.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.737
It's the only word that works.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.473
Was a little weird
seeing those two crying.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.475
Right? Not sexy.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.976
No.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.380
I will be asleep
when Adam gets home tonight.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.982
You know, if things work out

19:43.015 --> 19:44.617
and we marry these guys...

19:45.718 --> 19:46.853
...you'd be my mother

19:46.886 --> 19:49.389
and my sister-in-law.

19:51.424 --> 19:55.295
And you'd be married
to your stepuncle...

19:56.629 --> 19:59.899
...which would make you
your own niece.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.536
The sad part is,

20:03.570 --> 20:05.338
not the weirdest thing
we've ever done.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.375
Not even close.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.010
But still...

20:11.043 --> 20:13.313
heroes.
