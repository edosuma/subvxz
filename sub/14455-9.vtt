00:11.933 --> 00:14.467
Narrator: Coming up,
what's got Sal on the scent?

00:14.467 --> 00:16.267
There's a skunk in here?

00:17.733 --> 00:20.633
Why is Joe
keeping his eyes wide open?

00:23.167 --> 00:25.567
And which losing Jokers
will do a bang-up job

00:25.567 --> 00:27.600
in tonight's
double punishment?

00:29.933 --> 00:32.767
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:32.767 --> 00:33.833
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.533 --> 00:37.167
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:38.967 --> 00:41.700
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:41.700 --> 00:43.733
Joe: Larry!

00:47.567 --> 00:48.867
Sal:
Today we're at Lot Less

00:48.867 --> 00:50.267
approaching shoppers
and telling them

00:50.267 --> 00:52.600
they look like a character
from a TV show or movie

00:52.600 --> 00:54.067
that doesn't exist.

00:54.067 --> 00:55.967
The goal is to get
the person on videotape

00:55.967 --> 00:57.833
saying the character's
fake "catchphrase."

00:57.833 --> 00:59.567
If you can't get them
to record the catchphrase,

00:59.567 --> 01:01.500
you lose.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.633
Q: You're done.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.167
Q:
All right, here we go.

01:10.267 --> 01:11.600
Coconut oil?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.900
Oh, yeah, I think we might
be sold out of that, dear.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.067
Thank you.
Oh, no problem.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.100
Oh, my God,
this woman's all over you.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.333
I mean, I'll help you.

01:20.333 --> 01:21.333
This aisle has a lot of
good chocolates in it

01:21.333 --> 01:22.333
if you're looking.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.233
Sal, "You know, you look like
you're on a TV show."

01:28.233 --> 01:30.933
Are you, uh, an actress.

01:30.933 --> 01:32.100
I think you are.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.433
"Aren't you on the show
'Drug Mule or Pregnant'?"

01:34.433 --> 01:36.133
There's a show on TV.
I'm gonna tell you.

01:36.133 --> 01:39.467
it's a show called
"Drug Mule or Pregnant."

01:39.467 --> 01:40.867
Oh, my God.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.433
The guys go on a date
with two girls,

01:42.433 --> 01:44.300
and they have to decide
which one's pregnant,

01:44.300 --> 01:45.700
and which one's
the drug mule.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.500
There's a catchphrase
in the show all the time.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.167
"There's a skunk in here!"

01:51.167 --> 01:52.900
Every episode at the end,
she goes,

01:52.900 --> 01:54.567
"There's a skunk in here!"

01:54.567 --> 01:56.500
Murr:

01:56.500 --> 01:57.500
You know what,
no, no, no.

01:58.733 --> 02:01.600
My brother -- If he saw you
doing the catchphrase,

02:01.600 --> 02:03.300
he would think
it's the funniest thing.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.600
if I sent him -- if you went,
"There's a skunk in here!"

02:05.600 --> 02:06.700
That would be so funny.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.933
Yes, no problem.
Don't take my picture.

02:07.933 --> 02:09.133
Okay, oh, don't

02:09.133 --> 02:10.133
Ohh.
It's all right.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.067
Wait, oh!

02:11.067 --> 02:12.400
There's a skunk in here!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.633
Oh, you're the best.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.567
Oh, wow!

02:15.567 --> 02:17.833
Thank you.
You're the sweetest.
Thank you.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.900
-Wow, Sal.
-Unbelievable.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.067
Hi, you guys need help
with anything?

02:22.067 --> 02:23.433
I love the show.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.833
Woman: What show?

02:24.833 --> 02:26.067
"Surfstitute Teacher."

02:26.067 --> 02:27.333
Q:
"Surfstitute Teacher."

02:27.333 --> 02:29.067
It's about a cool,

02:29.067 --> 02:31.867
Hawaiian shirt-wearing
substitute teacher

02:31.867 --> 02:34.067
who surfs in
on summer vacation.

02:34.067 --> 02:35.900
He comes in,
he's got a catchphrase.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.533
He says...

02:37.533 --> 02:39.067
"Surf's up, asshats."

02:40.700 --> 02:42.767
He goes,
"Surf's up, asshats!"

02:42.767 --> 02:44.067
Would you do me a favor?
Woman: Mm-hmm.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.367
Could you do a video with me
where you're like,

02:45.367 --> 02:47.467
"Surf's up, asshats"?

02:47.467 --> 02:49.267
Please.
Watch, watch, watch.

02:49.267 --> 02:50.967
Hey, honey,
guess who I found.

02:50.967 --> 02:52.433
Could you just say it
real quick for me?

02:52.433 --> 02:53.500
"Surf's up, asshats."

02:53.500 --> 02:54.633
-Ahh!
-Ahh!

02:54.633 --> 02:56.367
Surf's up, asshat.

02:57.833 --> 02:58.867
You lose, asshat.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.967
I just work here.
They wouldn't let me manage.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.633
Everyone could hear you.

03:08.633 --> 03:11.233
It's not very professional,
in my opinion.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.800
So it's
the "surf's up" part?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.367
It's the "asshat."

03:16.967 --> 03:18.967
"Asshat's" a bad one, huh?
Woman: Ask this lady
if she thinks that's a bad one.

03:18.967 --> 03:20.700
Excuse me, ma'am.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.300
Remember that show
"Surf's Up"

03:22.300 --> 03:24.100
where the guy says "asshat"
all the time?

03:26.467 --> 03:27.600
I said it too loud.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.300
Do you think
that's professional?

03:29.300 --> 03:30.900
No.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.200
So "surf's up" is fine.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.333
"Surf's up" is fine.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.633
"Surf's up" is fine.
The "asshat" I didn't...

03:34.633 --> 03:36.800
Sal:
This is hysterical.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.167
They're having
a dead-serious conversation!

03:40.167 --> 03:41.533
Q: Right.
There's
a difference between

03:41.533 --> 03:42.800
what you say
in the break room

03:42.800 --> 03:44.400
and what you say
out on the...
Right, right.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.633
They're ganging up on Q.
I got his back.
Yeah?

03:45.633 --> 03:47.933
I got his back. Yeah.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.567
I shouldn't say that?
I shouldn't say...?

03:49.567 --> 03:51.667
Woman: In a loud voice.
You can say it in the street,
you know.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.333
Right.
And the yelling.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.600
Joe: Surf's up, asshat!

03:55.600 --> 03:57.433
-That's my manager.

03:57.433 --> 03:58.767
That's...

03:58.767 --> 04:00.933
Now I see where you get it.
Right, right.

04:00.933 --> 04:02.267
Forget what I said.
Right, right, right.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.433
"Forget what I said."
"Forget what I said."

04:05.433 --> 04:06.500
Surf's up, asshat.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.100
We have converted them!

04:12.100 --> 04:14.400
We'll give you the thumbs up.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.367
The Ferrero Rocher
is a mess.

04:17.367 --> 04:19.833
I am getting this aisle
back together.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.633
I do a lot of work on this show.
Let me tell you.

04:21.633 --> 04:22.867
I work a lot.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.167
He's patting himself
on the back

04:24.167 --> 04:25.433
for putting chocolate
straight.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.733
I can't take it.

04:27.733 --> 04:28.700
You guys good?

04:28.700 --> 04:30.467
Do you need help
with anything?

04:32.233 --> 04:33.433
Oh, my God, you look --

04:33.433 --> 04:35.167
You look just like
that actress on TV.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.433
You have a twin.

04:36.433 --> 04:38.100
It's -- The show is, uh...

04:38.100 --> 04:39.267
"Dumb-Dumbs Atlanta."

04:39.267 --> 04:42.300
The show is "Dumb" --
"Dumb-Dumbs Atlanta."

04:42.300 --> 04:44.233
It's one of those
spin-off shows.
You look like...

04:44.233 --> 04:46.500
"The lady that ate
a urinal cake."

04:47.767 --> 04:48.833
You look...

04:48.833 --> 04:50.267
There was this character --
this woman.

04:50.267 --> 04:51.367
She was outrageously funny.

04:51.367 --> 04:52.633
She's the one that
ate the urinal cake

04:52.633 --> 04:54.167
on the show.

04:54.167 --> 04:55.433
I swear she's your twin.

04:55.433 --> 04:58.067
She has a famous catchphrase
in it.

04:58.067 --> 05:00.400
"My kids will never forgive me
for the things I done."

05:02.633 --> 05:05.100
She -- Her catchphrase --
Her catchphrase is,

05:05.100 --> 05:07.533
"My kids will never forgive me
for the things I done."

05:10.400 --> 05:13.833
My wife is a huge fan
of this woman.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.367
Can I record a video
of you real quick

05:15.367 --> 05:17.167
once -- just saying
the one catchphrase?

05:17.167 --> 05:19.133
She's gonna die laughing tonight
when I show it to her.

05:19.133 --> 05:20.800
Okay.
Oh, you're the best.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.333
Okay, ready

05:22.333 --> 05:23.900
I'm recording, and go.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.967
My kids will never forgive me
for the things I've done.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.700
You are the best!

05:29.900 --> 05:31.067
He got it!

05:31.067 --> 05:32.533
"Dumb-Dumbs Atlanta"!

05:35.433 --> 05:36.633
These are all...

05:36.633 --> 05:37.733
Murr:
Don't mess up my work!

05:37.733 --> 05:40.400
Are you kidding me?!

05:41.400 --> 05:43.767
Don't mess up
the Ferrero Rocher!

05:46.367 --> 05:47.800
This is --

05:47.800 --> 05:49.533
No, this is a different flavor,
so it's more.

05:49.533 --> 05:50.667
This is...
$2.99.

05:50.667 --> 05:51.967
Are you an actor?

05:51.967 --> 05:53.133
Are you an actor?

05:53.133 --> 05:55.400
What?
An actor. Are you on TV?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.633
You look like a guy
on this show I watched.
Oh?

05:57.633 --> 05:58.800
"Fatty Goes to the Mall."

05:58.800 --> 06:00.967
The show is called
"Fatty Goes to the Mall."

06:00.967 --> 06:03.167
He's got this catchphrase --

06:03.167 --> 06:04.467
the character
he plays in it.

06:04.467 --> 06:07.467
"Get your white ass
out this bitch!"

06:07.467 --> 06:09.500
He -- He goes, uh,

06:09.500 --> 06:11.300
to everybody
that walks in the door,

06:11.300 --> 06:14.133
he goes, "Get your white ass
out this bitch!"

06:14.133 --> 06:15.300
Oh.
Yeah.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.967
Yeah, it's great.
But you look just like him.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.567
It's a funny show.
You should check it out.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.800
Okay.
Any chance I get to video you
saying that?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.367
"Get your white ass
out this bitch."

06:23.367 --> 06:24.600
Oh, no.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.533
Go ahead. Your turn.

06:28.533 --> 06:30.600
Get your white ass
out this bitch.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.700
No, that's okay.
That's okay.

06:34.633 --> 06:36.133
Oh, no.
Okay, thank you.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.600
Right there.
You were right there.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.500
Hey, are you an actress?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.067
You look like --
Do you get this a lot?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.933
No.
You ever see that...?

06:42.933 --> 06:44.700
Oh, that movie --
"Twelve Honkies."

06:44.700 --> 06:46.700
"Twelve" --
It's "Twelve Honkies."

06:48.100 --> 06:49.333
No, you've never seen it?
No?

06:49.333 --> 06:51.400
No, it's -- Bruce Willis
is in blackface and goes --

06:51.400 --> 06:52.733
comes back in time
to Philadelphia,

06:52.733 --> 06:53.800
and he gets shot.

06:54.933 --> 06:56.100
Credits roll.
That's it.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.367
No, you look just like
the -- the woman in it.

07:00.367 --> 07:01.633
It's got the catchphrase.

07:01.633 --> 07:03.333
"Night, night, ding-dong."

07:03.333 --> 07:06.267
Uh, catchphrase at the end,

07:06.267 --> 07:08.433
she goes, "Night, night,
ding-dong," and...

07:11.967 --> 07:13.667
You know what,
I got an idea.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.100
Can I get a quick video
of you just saying,

07:15.100 --> 07:16.467
"Night, night, ding-dong"
for my wife?

07:16.467 --> 07:17.667
She'd get a kick out of it.
No?

07:17.667 --> 07:18.967
I'm sure she would,
but no, thanks.

07:18.967 --> 07:19.767
No Okay.

07:22.367 --> 07:23.600
Night, night, ding-dong!

07:25.167 --> 07:27.300
Narrator:
It's night, night for Joe.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.700
He's first up
on the loser board.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.067
Today we're meeting
one-on-one with strangers

07:32.067 --> 07:33.900
to conduct
psychological experiments.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.833
But we're gonna be the ones
that seem crazy

07:35.833 --> 07:38.433
because we're gonna be doing
what the other guys tell us to.

07:38.433 --> 07:39.733
If at any point,

07:39.733 --> 07:42.167
you refuse to do anything
that you're told,

07:42.167 --> 07:43.233
you lose.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.133
Murr: You guys ready?
Let's go.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.667
It certainly
looks more magical

07:50.667 --> 07:52.600
when --
when you don't show it.
Yeah. Yeah.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.567
Joe: Here we go.
Hey, how are you?

07:57.567 --> 07:58.667
How you doing? Sal.
Claude.

07:58.667 --> 07:59.800
Claude.
Pleasure to see you.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.167
What we do here is
we run surveys,

08:02.167 --> 08:04.133
and we use that
as a baseline

08:04.133 --> 08:05.567
for when we do
actual testing.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.967
"I like to start my sessions
with an icebreaker."

08:07.967 --> 08:09.967
We'll start with an icebreaker.
That's what I like to do.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.100
"We're gonna sit across
from each other silently."

08:12.100 --> 08:15.267
So we'll sit across
from each other silently.

08:15.267 --> 08:17.900
"And we're gonna visualize
each other being tortured."

08:17.900 --> 08:19.300
And we're going to, uh...

08:20.700 --> 08:23.933
...visualize each other
being tortured.

08:23.933 --> 08:26.067
Uh, so we'll begin.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.967
Murr:
Oh, my God, this is weird.

08:37.567 --> 08:39.067
Q:

08:39.067 --> 08:41.600
Joe:

08:41.600 --> 08:43.867
So weird.

08:46.933 --> 08:48.367
Let's talk about
loved ones.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.333
I'm gonna walk you through
a couple of scenarios.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.600
"How many fingers do you wish
I was holding up?"

08:57.067 --> 09:00.267
How many fingers do you wish
I was holding up?

09:01.300 --> 09:02.300
Two.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.400
Two.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.200
"Hopeless. Hopeless."
Hopeless.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
Hopeless.

09:08.933 --> 09:10.067
Slurp your tea.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.700
Murr:
"I will tell you..."

09:14.700 --> 09:16.267
I will tell you...

09:16.267 --> 09:17.767
"...it is my
professional opinion..."

09:17.767 --> 09:19.733
...it is my --
hmm, let's see.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.133
He knows something's coming.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.267
Yep.

09:25.267 --> 09:27.067
I will tell you it is
my professional opinion.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.300
"...you have
West Nile Virus."

09:30.233 --> 09:33.067
...after what I've gathered,

09:33.067 --> 09:34.433
it is
my professional opinion

09:34.433 --> 09:35.967
that you do have
West Nile Virus.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.867
Q:

09:41.867 --> 09:43.267
How are you today?

09:43.267 --> 09:45.067
Doing pretty good.
How are you?
I'm great. Thank you.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.800
Have you ever gone to
a psychoanalyst before?

09:46.800 --> 09:48.067
No.
Do you know
what we do?

09:48.067 --> 09:50.300
Blair is...
On our team.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.833
...Is someone that we got
to come in

09:51.833 --> 09:53.233
and just flirt with Murray
on purpose.

09:53.233 --> 09:55.067
Okay, this gonna be exciting.
It's fun.

09:55.067 --> 09:57.067
"Would you describe yourself
as a good girl?"

09:57.067 --> 09:58.767
Would you describe yourself

09:58.767 --> 10:01.600
as a -- a good --
a good person?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.233
Yes.
You would?

10:03.233 --> 10:05.133
So a good girl?
Absolutely.

10:05.133 --> 10:07.133
"Oh, that's funny
'cause I like good girls."

10:07.133 --> 10:09.767
It's funny 'cause I --
I like good girls.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.700
Describe your personality to me
in your own words.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.400
How --
How do you see yourself.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.800
I'm a lot of fun.
Okay.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.967
Pretty.
Pretty!

10:20.967 --> 10:22.033
"Are you describing me?"

10:23.000 --> 10:24.200
Sounds like you're des--

10:24.200 --> 10:25.533
Sounds like
you're describing me.

10:26.733 --> 10:28.200
Maybe -- Maybe I am.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.067
No, only --

10:30.067 --> 10:31.733
I'm only these things because
I'm sitting next to you,

10:31.733 --> 10:34.133
if we remember, so...

10:34.133 --> 10:35.533
Don't give me
all the credit.

10:35.533 --> 10:36.833
Are we just watching
Murray fall in love?

10:36.833 --> 10:38.033
Is that what we're doing?

10:38.033 --> 10:41.367
He is hook, line, and sinker
right now.

10:41.367 --> 10:42.467
So, pretty. Okay.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.233
"Now, put these two colors
together."

10:44.233 --> 10:46.033
Now, put these two colors
together.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.067
Q: "Black and white."

10:51.633 --> 10:53.967
Black and white.

10:53.967 --> 10:55.767
Black and white.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.733
Ooh!
"By the way. By the way."

10:57.733 --> 10:59.433
Oh, by the way...
"This is all confidential."

10:59.433 --> 11:01.067
This is all confidential,
as I mentioned, okay?

11:01.067 --> 11:03.067
"But I can't promise
I'm not gonna tell bae."

11:03.067 --> 11:05.333
But I can't promise

11:05.333 --> 11:07.067
I won't tell bae
about today.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.667
I'm kidding.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.767
I'm bae-less.
Okay, as am I.

11:11.767 --> 11:13.100
As are you.
So, yeah.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.600
So we are sans bae.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.833
We are sans bae.

11:15.833 --> 11:16.967
Stop trying.
Please stop.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.333
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna throw up.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.400
I'm getting uncomfortable.
I'm getting uncomfortable.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.067
"Have you ever taken
a Horshart test?"

11:22.067 --> 11:23.633
Joe: Horshart?

11:23.633 --> 11:25.700
Horshart?
Horshart test!

11:25.700 --> 11:28.100
Have you ever --
Have you ever ever --

11:28.100 --> 11:29.967
Have you ever taken
a Horshart test?

11:29.967 --> 11:31.433
Horshart?
Horshart.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.067
Say it slowly. "Hor."

11:33.067 --> 11:34.133
Hor.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.067
"Shart."
Shart.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.067
You ever take one?

11:36.067 --> 11:37.267
No.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.600
Have you --
Have you ever seen "Hamilton"?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.700
I haven't seen it.
We should go sometime.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.433
That would be really great.
All right!

11:45.433 --> 11:47.133
What the hell
are you doing?
What the hell
are you doing?

11:47.133 --> 11:49.500
All right, what's your
favorite restaurant in the city?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.733
Dos Caminos.
Dos Caminos! Okay!

11:51.733 --> 11:52.967
I've been there many times.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.500
I've had
many margaritas there.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.067
We should also go there
for dinner.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.533
We could make a whole day
out of it.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.467
We could go to dinner
and then go see "Hamilton"

11:59.467 --> 12:01.167
and that would be
a lot of fun.
Are you serious?

12:01.167 --> 12:03.433
Yeah.
There is a serious connection
right now.

12:03.433 --> 12:06.267
Like, no joke.
There really is.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.267
Q: Okay, Blair. Great job.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.200
Thank you.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.500
Was that not real?

12:15.500 --> 12:17.333
That wasn't real?!

12:17.333 --> 12:19.200
That wasn't real?!

12:19.200 --> 12:20.167
She's our actress.

12:20.167 --> 12:21.267
That wasn't real?!

12:21.267 --> 12:22.833
Sal: You're done,

12:22.833 --> 12:24.833
and I've never been
more uncomfortable on this show

12:24.833 --> 12:26.567
than watching you trying
to flirt with her.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.833
Hi. How are you?
Hi.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.900
What's your name?
Gabrielle.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.433
Gabrielle, pleased to meet you.
Have a seat.

12:33.433 --> 12:34.933
Have you ever done
a Rorschach?

12:34.933 --> 12:36.767
I know what it is,
but I've never done it.
Okay, great.

12:36.767 --> 12:37.833
Joe, reach into the M&M's

12:37.833 --> 12:39.400
and pull out the glasses
I put in there.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.433
Oh, sorry.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.633
I don't know
how they ended up in there.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.233
That's a great
place for them.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.367
Cross your eyes.

12:48.367 --> 12:49.500
All right, here we go.

12:51.233 --> 12:53.133
Sal: What are you doing
with your eyes?

12:53.133 --> 12:54.500
You're just looking.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.767
I see a face.
Joe: You see a face?
Or what is it?

12:56.767 --> 12:58.333
And the face
kind of looks...

12:58.333 --> 13:00.367
-You look so funny.

13:00.367 --> 13:02.067
Cross them. You know
how to cross your eyes?

13:02.067 --> 13:03.967
I don't really know how to,
so...

13:06.800 --> 13:07.867
Human or animal?

13:07.867 --> 13:09.933
What is that
graffiti artist?

13:09.933 --> 13:11.333
Oh, the Old Bay one.
Yeah.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.767
Sal: You look like you're coming
in and out of consciousness.

13:13.767 --> 13:15.167
Got it.
The boogey mask.

13:15.167 --> 13:16.400
Yeah, it looks lifelike.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.633
Joe, the next time
you flip it, go,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.167
"What about
these  dots?"

13:22.167 --> 13:23.533
Real quick,
what about these  dots?

13:25.067 --> 13:26.300
This one here.
These  dots.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.167
Put these back.

13:33.733 --> 13:35.767
And where are you from?
New Orleans.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.400
"I bought this jacket
in New Orleans."

13:37.400 --> 13:39.067
Actually, I think I bought
this jacket in New Orleans.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.667
Oh, well, there, you see,
good taste.
Yeah, that's...

13:40.667 --> 13:41.800
"Oh, shut up."

13:41.800 --> 13:42.967
It's a good look.

13:42.967 --> 13:44.900
Shut up.

13:45.867 --> 13:46.867
I got this watch there,
too.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.267
I do like the watch,
actually.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.633
"Oh, shut up."

13:49.633 --> 13:51.067
Oh, sh-- shut up.

13:52.567 --> 13:54.867
Joe, ask her something,
and then go, "no, shut up."

13:56.800 --> 13:58.067
Let's talk about

13:58.067 --> 14:00.333
what you would consider
your daydream spot to be,

14:00.333 --> 14:01.567
like, a happy place.

14:01.567 --> 14:02.933
I actually
got a good one.
Shut up.

14:07.267 --> 14:08.733
Now,
tell me about your father.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.067
Oh, hi.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.200
"Welcome to my game
of cat-and-mouse."

14:14.200 --> 14:16.167
Welcome to my game
of cat-and-mouse.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.233
Okay.

14:19.767 --> 14:20.700
How long
have you lived here?

14:20.700 --> 14:22.067
It's going to be
two months.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.367
Go "gangster"
and play air guitar.

14:23.367 --> 14:24.367
Gangster, you know?

14:28.300 --> 14:29.833
"I'm gonna throw a thetical
right at you."

14:29.833 --> 14:31.133
I'm gonna throw a thetical
at you.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.067
"But it's not gonna be
from me."

14:32.067 --> 14:33.067
But it's not gonna be
from me.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.133
"It's gonna be
from my buddy..."

14:34.133 --> 14:35.667
It's gonna be
from my buddy...

14:35.667 --> 14:37.367
"...Mini Q."
...Mini Q.

14:37.367 --> 14:38.833
Yeah, go into that green box
to your right.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.200
Take him out.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.967
Murr: What?!

14:47.967 --> 14:49.700
This is a thetical
from Mini Q.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.900
Hey.
Okay. All right.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.733
If you were
walking in a park,

14:54.733 --> 14:56.900
and you heard
a bird chirp,

14:56.900 --> 14:57.967
do you look up?

14:59.100 --> 15:01.200
There's more.
There's more.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.300
Well, hold on.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.467
Do you look up?
Do you look down?

15:06.467 --> 15:09.067
Do you look left?
Or do you look right?

15:10.967 --> 15:13.533
I look where the sound
is coming from.

15:13.533 --> 15:17.267
Okay, okay, um,
let's not go off-script.

15:19.067 --> 15:20.700
"That's right."
Shake her hand.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.400
That's right.
Good job.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.967
That was
completely useless.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.600
Good afternoon, there,
Brian.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.067
Sal:

15:30.067 --> 15:31.133
These are
two of our buddies.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.400
Listen,
you can't keep doing this.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.400
We told you.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.867
What happened?
Can you tell me?

15:34.867 --> 15:37.500
This is --
It's still
under investigation.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.267
What do you mean?
Just --
It can't keep happening.

15:39.267 --> 15:40.567
Why is it
under investigation?

15:40.567 --> 15:41.867
I should know that.
Oh, no, no.

15:41.867 --> 15:43.367
You're in -- You're not in
any danger or anything.

15:43.367 --> 15:44.433
It's just, you know...

15:44.433 --> 15:46.067
Who was that?

15:46.067 --> 15:47.500
I rocked too hard once.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.533
Do they keep
coming in like this?

15:49.533 --> 15:51.067
They're investigating
my rock-itude --

15:51.067 --> 15:52.433
my general rock-itude.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.667
Just do air-guitar motion,
but don't make any noise.

15:57.467 --> 15:59.067
Murr: Keep playing.
Keep playing.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.100
Take out
the Rorschach tests.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.800
Ever done
a Rorschach test?

16:12.800 --> 16:14.333
Uh, no.
Okay.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.133
What do you see?

16:16.133 --> 16:17.300
A woman.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.100
"Wait a second.
This is the wrong test.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.867
This is the test
we give to smart people."
Yeah.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.133
Wait, wait, you know what.

16:23.133 --> 16:26.667
This is the --
This is the wrong set.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.333
This is the one --
This is the one I
give stupid people,

16:28.333 --> 16:29.867
and that's not you.

16:31.633 --> 16:32.633
Got him.

16:32.633 --> 16:33.567
That's not you.

16:35.367 --> 16:37.500
Narrator:
Q rocked his way to a loss,

16:37.500 --> 16:40.533
which means it's time for
a double punishment.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.867
All right, Joe and Q lost,

16:41.867 --> 16:43.400
so today we are at
the Prudential Center

16:43.400 --> 16:45.067
for the Seton Hall Pirates
basketball game.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.533
Guys, for your punishment,

16:46.533 --> 16:48.633
you've got to join
the Marching Cobras of New York

16:48.633 --> 16:49.867
for their halftime show.

16:49.867 --> 16:51.167
We have to perform?
How many people are here?

16:51.167 --> 16:52.367
Like, 30?
About 7,000.

16:52.367 --> 16:54.067
Oh, yeah.
It's about 7,000 people.

16:54.067 --> 16:57.200
Q: Oh, well, that's not making
me feel any better now.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.133
**

17:00.133 --> 17:02.100
Sal:

17:02.100 --> 17:03.567
We're moments away.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.433
You guys ready?
Murr: 3, 2, 1.

17:06.433 --> 17:08.067
Halftime.

17:08.067 --> 17:09.533
Here we go!

17:09.533 --> 17:11.967
Oh, they're already
nervous.

17:11.967 --> 17:13.467
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

17:13.467 --> 17:14.667
please welcome
onto the floor

17:14.667 --> 17:16.467
the Marching Cobra Drumline.

17:16.467 --> 17:18.833
Now, the Marching Cobras
of New York --

17:18.833 --> 17:20.267
They are the real deal.

17:20.267 --> 17:21.933
Polished, professional.

17:21.933 --> 17:25.400
And then there's these two.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.567
It's important to note
that only the band leader

17:27.567 --> 17:30.233
knows that Joe and Q
are infiltrating the band.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.467
Also,
we threw hats on them.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.367
They look ridiculous.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.733
Ohh.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.500
My balls. My balls.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.700
Sal:
Good, it's a punishment.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.733
Away with your balls.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.533
All: Get some!

17:52.300 --> 17:53.533
Look at this guy.

17:53.533 --> 17:55.400
He's like, "Who the
are these guys?"

17:55.400 --> 17:57.667
Murr: Q looks like the march
of the wooden soldiers.

17:57.667 --> 17:58.900
Get in between them.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.633
I got to give credit to
the marching band.
Yeah.

18:08.633 --> 18:09.933
They're staying the course.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.067
They're not even, like --
No, they're in it.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.633
Get into it.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.667
Joe: Whoo!

18:13.667 --> 18:15.067
Q: Whoo!

18:15.067 --> 18:16.700
Murr:
I can't hear you, Joe.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.567
Joe: I said nice!

18:18.567 --> 18:20.267
Whoo!

18:20.267 --> 18:21.767
Sal:

18:21.767 --> 18:23.133
Whoo!

18:23.133 --> 18:24.900
I like how they're just like,
"The show must go on."

18:24.900 --> 18:26.833
Joe: Whoo!

18:26.833 --> 18:28.767
Q!

18:34.933 --> 18:36.867
Drum battle!
Drum battle!

18:38.533 --> 18:40.833
Joe: Drum battle!

18:46.333 --> 18:47.967
Murr:
That's the lamest thing.

18:47.967 --> 18:50.833
Sal:
They look ridiculous.

18:50.833 --> 18:54.433
Hey, guys, also,
you're gonna be dancing next.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.133
What?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.100
Joe: I got nothing left.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.500
Why are we dancing?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.867
Sal:

19:02.867 --> 19:04.067
Joe:

19:04.067 --> 19:05.200
Sal:

19:05.200 --> 19:07.867
Bring in the sequins.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.533
Oh, come on.

19:09.533 --> 19:10.967
**

19:10.967 --> 19:12.233
Murr: Come on, guys.
Get into position.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.600
Q:
I still got drumsticks.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.733
**

19:16.733 --> 19:17.933
Let's see you keep up
with the dancers.

19:17.933 --> 19:20.333
Sal:
Do exactly what they do.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.667
Q: Whoo! What?

19:21.667 --> 19:23.200
Joe: Okay, do it!

19:25.467 --> 19:27.067
Sal: Oh, my God.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.800
Back dat ass up, Q.

19:40.067 --> 19:42.533
Guys, copy everything
they're doing.

19:42.533 --> 19:44.600
Look at Joe.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.767
Joe, we can't even
see your eyeballs.

19:46.767 --> 19:48.733
Your hat is so low.

19:48.733 --> 19:50.133
It's just a nose.

19:54.633 --> 19:56.900
Q, Q,
right now back on drums.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.367
Look at Joe!
Look at Joe!

20:01.367 --> 20:02.367
Yes!

20:11.833 --> 20:13.167
Run! Run!

20:13.167 --> 20:14.833
**

20:14.833 --> 20:16.467
Run!

20:27.700 --> 20:29.300
Welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

20:29.300 --> 20:31.167
Q and Joe
just got punished right here,

20:31.167 --> 20:34.133
and now you get to see
a behind-the-scenes look
of how it happened.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.467
And I'll give you bonus footage
from tonight's episode.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.300
Geoff:
It's a more complicated
punishment than usual

20:43.300 --> 20:44.900
because two Jokers are actually
gonna be out there.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.333
Ooh.
So it's --

20:46.333 --> 20:47.833
We need facial expressions
from both, right?

20:47.833 --> 20:49.233
Yes, it's gonna be --

20:49.233 --> 20:51.567
It's twice the coverage
in that way.

20:51.567 --> 20:55.000
It's gonna be that much
more fun, though, as well.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.867
I'll tell you about
today's punishment.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.867
This is revenge.
Ah.

21:01.867 --> 21:05.433
So the last time,
if you remember,

21:05.433 --> 21:07.400
it was Sal and I
were the ones that got punished.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.633
That's right.
That's right.

21:08.633 --> 21:09.867
Do you remember what?
The helicopter.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.167
Ohh!
Oh, Murray goes down!

21:13.167 --> 21:14.933
Aah! Aah!

21:14.933 --> 21:17.900
Joe: Sal!

21:17.900 --> 21:19.533
That's from the helicopter?
That's from the helicopter --

21:19.533 --> 21:20.933
when I fell on the runway.
Oh, when you fell
when you were running.

21:20.933 --> 21:22.133
When they had me
in the fat suit.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.133
Scar still to this day.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.833
That was two years ago
at this point.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.533
It still bleeds, the scar.

21:30.167 --> 21:31.400
You are in on this,
right,

21:31.400 --> 21:33.233
but the marching band
does not know what's happening.

21:33.233 --> 21:34.433
That's right.
Absolutely.

21:34.433 --> 21:35.933
What's that like
keeping a secret?

21:35.933 --> 21:37.700
It's funny
'cause I know their reactions.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.200
I'm actually --
I can't wait for the moment.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.333
Sal: All right, here we go.
Three, two, one.

21:43.333 --> 21:46.633
All right, tonight,
Q and Joe lost.

21:46.633 --> 21:49.933
You have got to join
the Marching Cobras of New York

21:49.933 --> 21:51.567
while they do
their halftime show.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.233
I hope these Cobras
don't bite.

21:53.233 --> 21:54.900
Ah!
What if they bite?

21:56.867 --> 21:58.200
You know it's not gonna go
as well as you think it is.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.633
No, it's not.
It's definitely not.

21:59.633 --> 22:00.933
There's definitely
gonna be --

22:00.933 --> 22:02.733
The problem is
there's a lot of people here,

22:02.733 --> 22:04.933
and I'm also not
in peak physical condition.
Right.

22:04.933 --> 22:06.400
What part
is the scariest to you --

22:06.400 --> 22:08.333
the band part
or the marching?
This interview.

22:08.333 --> 22:09.833
You better just hold
your  out there.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.433
That's all I'm saying.

22:11.433 --> 22:12.867
We have a reputation
to uphold.

22:12.867 --> 22:14.767
What? What reputation
are you talking about?

22:14.767 --> 22:16.333
Wait, wait, which one of
you guys is Nick Cannon?

22:16.333 --> 22:18.767
I'm no Nick Cannon.

22:18.767 --> 22:20.800
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome onto the floor

22:20.800 --> 22:22.333
the Marching Cobra Drumline.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.533
Murr: Here we go!

22:25.700 --> 22:26.633
All: Get some!

22:26.633 --> 22:28.167
It's going now.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.900
Sal:

22:31.900 --> 22:34.167
Joe: Drum battle!

22:34.167 --> 22:35.433
What?!

22:39.933 --> 22:41.200
He can't break it!
Sal: Break the drumstick!

22:43.867 --> 22:46.133
Q: Hey! Oh!

22:46.133 --> 22:48.167
Murr: Oh-ho!

22:48.167 --> 22:49.933
Oh, my God!

22:49.933 --> 22:52.867
Announcer: The Marching Cobras,
plus two.

22:54.133 --> 22:56.567
Any you guys ever heard of
"Impractical Jokers"?

22:58.467 --> 23:00.967
Those are two guys
from the "Impractical Jokers."

23:00.967 --> 23:03.900
Yeah. Yeah.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.567
We were so confused.

23:05.567 --> 23:08.333
Your director, Terrel --
He put you guys up to this.

23:08.333 --> 23:10.400
-That's crazy.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.667
Man: That's crazy, man.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.600
Give it up for him.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.500
The catchphrase is,
"Hey, I used to have hair."

23:23.500 --> 23:25.067
"You put down
those lady parts."

23:25.067 --> 23:27.300
"Guac me in la cabeza."

23:27.300 --> 23:29.433
"I think I broke my book!"

23:29.433 --> 23:32.067
"Life is like a box of tampons."

23:34.100 --> 23:35.267
In the movie show, he says,

23:35.267 --> 23:36.833
"Guten tag.
Champagne, por favor."

23:36.833 --> 23:38.433
He always says,
"That's a lot of pork!"

23:38.433 --> 23:39.767
"Pull me to the toilet,
Alphonse.

23:39.767 --> 23:41.067
I'm about to blow."

23:41.067 --> 23:42.133
You know?

23:42.133 --> 23:43.200
"Oh, yeah,

23:43.200 --> 23:45.067
I know a bag of nickels
when I see one."

23:45.067 --> 23:46.633
"Hubba, hubba, chubby bubba."

23:46.633 --> 23:48.500
"Eduardo don't believe
in no evolution."

23:49.967 --> 23:51.600
Joe:
Surf's up, asshat!

23:51.600 --> 23:53.367
**
