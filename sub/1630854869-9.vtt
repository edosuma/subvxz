00:11.178 --> 00:15.265
Your brighter tomorrow doesn't start
when you land on the moon.

00:15.265 --> 00:19.645
It starts when you arrive in our
state-of-the-art BrightSider rocket.

00:19.645 --> 00:24.191
The very ship itself that takes you
to the Brightside Lunar Residences.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.778
And three days
on an exclusive BrightSider rocket

00:27.778 --> 00:34.076
means three days of luxury,
of leisure and of five-star dining.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.912
<i>Marlene, what's cooking tonight?</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:42.209
<i>Now that's good home cooking, in space.</i>

00:42.835 --> 00:46.672
<i>And Shana has converted her seating pod</i>

00:46.672 --> 00:49.508
<i>into a luxurious,
double-wide sleeping area</i>

00:49.508 --> 00:50.717
<i>to get some rest.</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:54.513
Or maybe, I don't know, catch up
on a couple of reruns of Space Sheriff

00:54.513 --> 00:57.891
on the Brightside's
exclusive lunar television.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.230
And of course,
when you're flying to the moon,

01:03.230 --> 01:04.897
it's always five o'clock.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.654
And always on the house.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.287
Out of this world.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.416
<i>And while you're considering
an exciting purchase</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:24.459
<i>or getting ready for our next launch,</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:29.173
<i>come see a BrightSider rocket for yourself
at our wonderful new launch facility,</i>

01:29.173 --> 01:31.341
<i>right here in Vistaville.</i>

01:31.341 --> 01:35.137
<i>Yes, it's an exciting time for us
here at the Brightside,</i>

01:35.137 --> 01:39.892
<i>and we just can't wait for you
to live your brighter tomorrow today.</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:48.335
What you got there?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.547
Here.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.468
That's from the Sea of Serenity,

02:56.468 --> 03:00.389
243,000 miles up.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.641
What'd you do?
Pick it up at a parking lot?

03:03.267 --> 03:04.476
Wouldn't you like to know?

03:05.060 --> 03:08.939
A virtuoso and a fucking pebble.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.150
That's great American business.

03:14.987 --> 03:18.031
Oh, man. You have no idea, do you?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.158
How big this thing goes.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.912
Well, I'm just hoping to get Ma
out of the home and into her own place.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.291
Well then, look out there.

03:30.794 --> 03:31.879
They're fueling up.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.262
It's been six weeks.
Investors are tired of delays.

03:40.262 --> 03:44.391
So, I announced a launch. This week.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.144
Wait.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.646
We said we were months out.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.358
They're looking us up and down.
Time to make them beg for it.

03:53.358 --> 03:57.696
So send them some nice pictures.
They'll want it more for waiting.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.406
Jack.

03:59.948 --> 04:05.120
You and I both know that the world runs
on dupes' misspent dollars.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.999
I mean, I thought that's why
we had so much fun together.

04:10.375 --> 04:14.254
And when they come back down?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.173
They'll be thumbing it
at launch terminals for months

04:17.173 --> 04:19.091
before they get a flight back.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.889
And when they tell everyone the truth?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.557
Then we'll have cashed out

04:25.557 --> 04:29.311
and left lawyers to muzzle them
and mop up.

04:31.355 --> 04:35.734
We get the money. We make the truth.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.240
Now open your gift and enjoy it.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.206
Hey.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.626
You're throwing the opening pitch
for the Volts tonight.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.380
Wow.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.341
Every little boy's dream.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.469
You're my pebble.

05:03.512 --> 05:08.308
And everything you did with this,
I can do with you.

05:19.778 --> 05:20.779
Joey!

05:21.446 --> 05:25.117
Hey. Merry Christmas. Almost.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.285
Hey, you got a minute?

05:27.035 --> 05:30.581
- Please, kid, I got some news.
- I got no time for door-to-door salesmen.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.333
I worked it for you to throw
the first pitch for the Volts tonight.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.252
Meet the team and everything.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.589
It's once in a lifetime.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.135
Don't miss it because of me.

05:43.135 --> 05:48.765
And I don't know if you heard,
but we got a launch on the books.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.978
Everything's coming together.
It'd mean the world to share it with you.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.569
Where's everyone going?

06:02.154 --> 06:04.948
- Who?
- The people in your rocket.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.534
- You didn't build them any houses.
- They're gonna be fine.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.870
- What do you think I am?
- I have no fucking idea.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.294
You're not selling this house!

06:18.712 --> 06:21.465
You're a lot of things,
but you're not strapped for cash.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.674
Grow up!

06:23.967 --> 06:26.637
Life's not going away
no matter how much you pout about it.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.140
The invite stands!

06:30.891 --> 06:33.310
Unless you want to blow that
for yourself too!

06:40.651 --> 06:43.278
T-minus 76 hours, 34 minutes, Mr. B.

06:43.862 --> 06:47.366
And news of the launch also
has our sales rocketing upward, currently.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.953
Who all knows about the launch, Herb?

06:51.453 --> 06:54.414
Everyone. Betty's been making
exciting calls all morning.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.167
- They're excited to hear from us.
- It's an exciting time.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.544
I see you've been very busy,

06:58.544 --> 07:00.921
which is why probably we found out
about the launch

07:00.921 --> 07:03.882
from Mrs. Selwyn's associates,
and not from you.

07:03.882 --> 07:08.053
Yeah, that's it. She's been making
a lot of things happen right now.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.431
Only I should mention there are
a few final decisions outstanding,

07:11.431 --> 07:14.935
- in terms of who's in the departure queue.
- Right, just take care of it, Herb.

07:14.935 --> 07:19.523
Right, yes. Sorry, Jack,
about not showing more initiative

07:19.523 --> 07:21.149
and following through there.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.903
I'm on it. Only I'm not exactly sure
about what's the best--

07:24.903 --> 07:26.488
Just take care of it!

07:28.740 --> 07:31.034
He seems really eager
for me to take care of it.

07:31.535 --> 07:32.911
Hell's wrong with him?

07:35.539 --> 07:39.126
And why did you apologize
for him being so out to lunch?

07:39.126 --> 07:43.338
Because I didn't
not let it impede my doing better.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.967
We've been keeping
this office alive for a month now,

07:46.967 --> 07:49.094
while Shirley and Eddie are off
who knows where.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.054
And I'm still on a freakin' temp contract.

07:51.054 --> 07:54.683
He should try being a little grateful,
since we are all he's got.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.060
No one's ever done more for me, Bun Bun.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.023
He owes you a promotion.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.401
Your card, ma'am.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.032
The bet is to you, sir.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.203
The bet is to you, sir.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.916
- I'm all in.
- All in.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.001
All in.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.754
All in.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.009
- That's all, folks.
- Oh, f--

08:29.009 --> 08:31.762
Congratulations, ma'am. You win.

08:31.762 --> 08:34.597
Congratulations, ma'am. You win.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.519
Your wedding day.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.813
You wanted the taffeta,
and you were right.

08:42.481 --> 08:47.277
And that smile Jacky's giving you,
you can't fake that.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.363
Now,

08:50.572 --> 08:54.952
I know we've had some rough spots, us two.

08:56.203 --> 09:00.832
And Lord knows,
you hold a grudge like a goddamn pit bull.

09:00.832 --> 09:04.294
But our boys haven't talked in a month.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.965
And it's going to take us getting along
to make it right.

09:07.965 --> 09:12.845
That's why I'm here today,
taking the high road.

09:13.512 --> 09:17.015
And that's why you are going
to have to admit you still love him.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.601
And he's desperate for you.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.353
Excuse me?

09:21.854 --> 09:23.981
Joey. Sweet boy.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.441
You look tired. Are you sleeping?

09:26.441 --> 09:28.569
I'm fine. What are you doing here?

09:29.152 --> 09:32.239
Our family needs to stay together
right now.

09:32.239 --> 09:37.202
I thought your mother might want to hear
about some of these old things.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.746
The past has a pull, you know.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.374
- Can I show you?
- No, thanks.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.670
Look, I understand
you not taking your father's calls.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.798
It's all I can do myself sometimes.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.801
But Joseph, he's family.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.011
He's a con man.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.017
And I am so sick of keeping my mouth shut
and having to live with his mistakes.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.352
That's what having a father is.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.856
Doesn't have to be.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.567
What the hell does that mean?

10:22.039 --> 10:24.166
- God, you were gorgeous in there.
- Oh, my God.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.793
- Nobody saw you, did they?
- When you turned over that full house,

10:26.793 --> 10:29.463
parts of me quivered
I would've sworn were not mobile, Shirley.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.590
Here. Look.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.260
- It's so much.
- Come to papa.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.138
Oh, Shirley,
let's never go back to real life.

10:38.722 --> 10:42.059
Such an unpalatable mixture
of winning and losing.

10:42.059 --> 10:45.395
Can we agree that you win
a lot more when I'm around?

10:45.395 --> 10:48.941
- Yeah, when we cheat.
- And nobody misses the goddamn moon.

10:48.941 --> 10:51.693
It's just a ball of dust.
Can't even shine on its own.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.696
Fuck!

10:55.239 --> 10:57.950
- Fred! Get out of here, Shirley!
- Stop it!

10:57.950 --> 11:00.327
- You pullin' two-man action in my game?
- Shit.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.123
- Fred! Okay.
- Certain forces, once unleashed,

11:05.123 --> 11:07.084
can only find recompense in blood.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.877
- Don't hurt him, please!
- No, it's all right.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.713
We got a history, me and him.
Fred, just one second, okay?

11:11.713 --> 11:14.341
- Please. Fred, just listen.
- What are you doing?

11:14.341 --> 11:15.425
Fred--

11:22.099 --> 11:23.559
<i>Enjoy your breakfast.</i>

11:31.984 --> 11:34.069
Hey.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.362
Expect another visit.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.990
- Come on.
- Penalties, plus interest.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.783
You fucking animal!

11:39.783 --> 11:44.079
- Careful.
- Sorry. Okay.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.630
Here. I made it for you. It smells nice.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.008
Thank you.

11:56.008 --> 11:59.011
- Is it "cimmanon"?
- Lavender.

12:00.137 --> 12:03.265
Les, I made it.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.768
Yes, you said. Thank you.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.688
No. I made the launch list.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.315
I'm going up in three days.

12:11.315 --> 12:14.193
So I probably won't be back
for a while, and--

12:14.193 --> 12:15.611
That's "impobbisle."

12:15.611 --> 12:18.989
I have yet to verify the vessel's
passenger-class certification.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.116
So you can't find a piece of paper?

12:21.116 --> 12:24.578
Leaving orbit on an unregistered launch--

12:26.246 --> 12:27.664
I can have it halted.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.459
- And I would never forgive you.
- No.

12:32.294 --> 12:35.422
But you see,
I made this mistake before, ma--

12:37.424 --> 12:38.717
What?

12:38.717 --> 12:41.136
What are you so hung up on, Les?

12:47.017 --> 12:48.060
May I see her?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.868
She was well trained...

13:07.788 --> 13:09.414
but it only takes one mistake.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.086
I'm sorry.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.296
No need.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.258
You weren't driving the truck.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.136
You didn't violate the off-leash rule.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.933
I'm still sorry. It's awful.

13:30.269 --> 13:31.687
But it's not all your fault.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.649
That is the customary consolation.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.486
But you see, I--

13:41.029 --> 13:42.030
I loved her.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.245
That's why I let her break the rules.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.791
You loved her.

13:53.876 --> 13:54.877
Correct.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.716
And what does that have to do with me?

14:03.218 --> 14:04.219
Well...

14:08.390 --> 14:09.933
The rules are the rules, ma'am.

14:12.436 --> 14:13.520
Jesus.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.440
Stop goddamn calling me "ma'am!"

14:30.913 --> 14:32.831
Let's get a move on, you lugs!

14:32.831 --> 14:36.043
She wants liftoff in three days,
not three weeks.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.712
Watch it. Lock it in right.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.172
Yeah, you got it, Walt.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.177
- Put on your fucking goggles.
- What?

14:48.013 --> 14:49.181
What did I say?

14:49.181 --> 14:50.682
Guys, get help! Help!

14:50.682 --> 14:52.142
Turn the valve off!

14:56.063 --> 14:58.023
Get that genius to a doctor.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.652
We're gonna need some help!

15:01.652 --> 15:04.905
Could you list, sir, three potential areas
of contribution

15:04.905 --> 15:06.448
you'd contribute upon arrival

15:06.448 --> 15:09.243
to build a more collaborative
Lunar community?

15:09.243 --> 15:12.663
<i>What are we discussing here?
I'm a first-class passenger.</i>

15:13.163 --> 15:15.207
And you should know your current attitude

15:15.207 --> 15:18.085
will determine your position
in the departure queue.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.087
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake.</i>

15:20.087 --> 15:23.382
<i>You're gonna hear from my lawyer
if I'm not on that launch.</i>

15:23.924 --> 15:27.344
Don't write that, Bun Bun.
You could just put "expletive."

15:28.929 --> 15:30.305
Good we checked him out.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.600
So, only two seats left.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.936
We should fill them appropriately.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.480
Maybe we should run this decision by Jack.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.859
- He's great with decisions.
- Except he's never here.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.236
And when he is,
he's checked out and worthless.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.365
You know, Herbie,
HQ would really wanna hear about him

15:48.365 --> 15:50.909
and his poor performance.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.372
And they'd be impressed
by whoever told them.

15:55.372 --> 15:59.209
No.
That's actually going over Jack's head.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.337
And luckily,
I don't have anyone's Lunar link.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.341
Well, then,
if we really wanna do the right thing,

16:06.341 --> 16:07.968
we should tell them in person.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.846
Maybe lounge by the pool.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.141
Take another shot at the twins.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.102
Yes.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.563
I'm sorry that's been so...

16:21.565 --> 16:22.649
unproductive lately.

16:34.703 --> 16:35.996
We're rushing is why.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.497
You said it was his own fault.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.459
Sure he's a dumb fuck,
but a rushing dumb fuck is worse.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.461
I don't trust her, Jack.

16:42.461 --> 16:43.545
Her?

16:43.545 --> 16:46.673
Well, then don't let her walk your dog.
She's the boss now.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.426
Weren't you the boss once?
Like when I signed on for this?

16:49.426 --> 16:53.472
Hey. You spent the last 20 years
being afraid. Try something new.

16:53.472 --> 16:57.267
Skip the pep talk.
I'll just shut my mouth and do my job.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.311
Sure. That'll help.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.314
I'll see if this grows him a new leg.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.497
Look, Mr. Porter, Mr. Nichols, and
Miss Stedman all knew nothing about it.

17:18.497 --> 17:22.000
They didn't know a thing. And of course,
I quit as soon as I found out, but...

17:22.000 --> 17:24.086
Well, we knew nothing about the launch.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.170
Rest assured,

17:25.170 --> 17:27.506
informants are granted exemption
from prosecution.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.883
Your county thanks you.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.635
It was all Jack.

17:32.678 --> 17:35.514
And if you need me to testify,
I don't mind saying it to his face.

17:35.514 --> 17:41.353
I'm afraid spoken testimony
will prove insufficient to convict.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.649
The case requires further "edivence."

17:46.525 --> 17:47.860
I'll do whatever you need.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.742
How long will he go to jail?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.412
That's the court's discretion,

17:58.412 --> 18:03.917
but if he really intends
to put innocent customers in harm's way,

18:05.752 --> 18:08.380
we can't dismiss the "pobbisility"
of life in prison.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.466
Fine. Good.

18:18.599 --> 18:23.395
You know, Pops,
it's like the words all broke.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.608
Said 'em too many times.
They just don't work anymore.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.827
Trust me. We're gonna make it.

18:45.501 --> 18:46.793
Tomorrow's the day.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.006
You ever had that?

18:55.761 --> 18:57.346
You fucking coward.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.311
And I fell right into your trap, huh?

19:07.105 --> 19:09.149
Selling myself that I'd be somebody.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.824
Whole lot to goddamn live up to.

19:53.402 --> 19:54.778
I couldn't do it.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.033
- I'm sorry.
- No way.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.286
You got back in the car
with a handless gimp, Shirley.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.245
That means a lot.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.455
Yeah, the kind of money we need
he'd lose the house and--

20:05.455 --> 20:07.291
I get it. He's your husband. Please.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.375
No.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.630
I told him I was leaving.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.175
For good.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.093
You're shitting me.

20:18.802 --> 20:19.803
It just came out.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.307
And he hardly blinked.

20:24.141 --> 20:27.102
I've seen him more worked up
when someone stands in front of the TV.

20:27.102 --> 20:30.480
Shirley, he never deserved you.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.365
Fuck!

20:42.117 --> 20:44.077
- You okay?
- No!

20:47.456 --> 20:51.418
Oh, God, Shirley. Let's just beg Jack
to get us on the next launch, huh?

20:52.211 --> 20:53.670
We'll be safe on the moon.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.007
What?

20:57.007 --> 21:00.719
How can I be the only one
raising my hand with ideas here?

21:03.055 --> 21:05.307
Look, Ed,
I should've told you this sooner but...

21:10.687 --> 21:11.980
What?

21:13.023 --> 21:14.149
There's nothing up there.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.652
What?

21:17.277 --> 21:18.278
No houses.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.406
No Brightside.

21:24.368 --> 21:25.953
Jack played us.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.290
Are you actually telling me
what you just told me?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.668
Yeah. He's a fucking monster.

21:33.377 --> 21:37.548
Yeah, very possible,
but that does not exclude him

21:37.548 --> 21:40.217
from being a bankable fucking genius.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.011
Wow.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.139
I've been pretty pissed he lied.

21:46.139 --> 21:50.978
Of course, but that doesn't stop us
from making him an honest liar

21:50.978 --> 21:53.564
and giving us our piece, right?

21:53.564 --> 21:54.773
And if he fucking blinks,

21:54.773 --> 21:56.817
we hold him
over a fucking blackmail barrel

21:56.817 --> 21:58.402
till we're fucking rich.

21:59.403 --> 22:00.404
Right?

22:04.908 --> 22:07.411
<i>Message received. 8:05 a.m.</i>

22:07.411 --> 22:13.333
<i>Jackie, I'm worried. Joey's in bad shape.
You need to do something.</i>

22:13.333 --> 22:16.712
<i>I'm afraid he wants to get you in trouble.</i>

22:16.712 --> 22:21.800
<i>Don't lie to yourself
about what he's after. Call me!</i>

22:23.302 --> 22:24.678
<i>New message.</i>

22:24.678 --> 22:29.308
<i>Hi, Jack.
So, listen, about the game tonight, I...</i>

22:32.019 --> 22:33.020
<i>I'm in.</i>

22:37.691 --> 22:41.987
And stop.
No need for further functionality.

22:42.738 --> 22:45.824
Tape capacity is 62 minutes.

22:46.617 --> 22:52.331
And position yourself away from
"amfclified" music and heavy machinery.

22:53.790 --> 22:54.791
Are you ready?

22:56.001 --> 22:57.836
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

22:59.004 --> 23:01.465
Not sure I understand.

23:03.926 --> 23:06.345
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Shorter.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.183
<i>Tonight's game is brought to you by</i>

23:11.183 --> 23:15.562
<i>the good people
of the Brightside Lunar Residences.</i>

23:16.980 --> 23:19.608
<i>Welcome to Volts Park,
home of your Vistaville Volts.</i>

23:19.608 --> 23:20.692
Jack.

23:22.945 --> 23:24.488
Hey.

23:24.488 --> 23:28.700
Hey, this is something, isn't it?
Right? Being down here, right?

23:28.700 --> 23:29.785
Yeah.

23:31.912 --> 23:33.330
Hey, I just hope, though,

23:34.665 --> 23:38.168
whatever is between us,
we can drop it for the night

23:38.168 --> 23:41.255
- so you can enjoy the game, okay?
- Okay,

23:41.255 --> 23:43.757
I was thinking maybe
we could talk for a minute first?

23:48.554 --> 23:49.555
Okay.

23:50.681 --> 23:53.809
Well, let's see what we can do.

23:53.809 --> 23:56.770
And I don't want a sales pitch, all right?
I want straight answers.

23:57.729 --> 23:58.730
'Course.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.862
You gotta ask the questions first, though.

24:07.865 --> 24:10.576
I wanna know
if you've ever built anything up there.

24:11.535 --> 24:16.039
Or if you've ever tried.
There's no Brightside, right? No houses?

24:20.669 --> 24:21.962
Hey, think fast.

24:34.892 --> 24:36.268
We're a little rusty.

24:38.061 --> 24:40.689
And that's on me, backyard catch and all.

24:42.232 --> 24:44.902
- Hey, Jack. You know, I've--
- Nah.

24:44.902 --> 24:46.195
Don't worry about it.

24:48.238 --> 24:51.116
If that thing is still running,
why don't you take a seat?

25:16.016 --> 25:17.809
So, there's nothing up there, Joe.

25:22.731 --> 25:23.732
Not yet.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.569
I got plans.
I'm gonna have the money, but--

25:27.569 --> 25:29.947
No, Jack. No.

25:31.907 --> 25:34.618
It's too late to pretend
that this can get better.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.205
Are you sure?
That sounds like a tough way to live.

25:38.789 --> 25:41.959
You're sending people up there, Jack.
That's more than anyone can live with.

25:41.959 --> 25:44.294
I wouldn't do that.

25:44.962 --> 25:45.963
Sure.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.509
You don't believe me, you got everything
you need to stop me there, right?

25:53.846 --> 25:55.305
You just say whatever you want.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.854
Pal, you don't have to trust me.

26:05.399 --> 26:07.401
- But I know I trust you.
- Stop it.

26:07.401 --> 26:10.237
And I care about you.

26:10.863 --> 26:14.157
And goddamn, that--
It beats being hopeless.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.868
We were doing fine without you.

26:17.411 --> 26:18.412
You know?

26:22.124 --> 26:23.417
When I showed up,

26:23.417 --> 26:27.796
you were a stock boy dreaming
about running away to the moon.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.351
Goddamn it, Jack, why did you leave us?

26:55.616 --> 26:56.992
I was terrified...

27:00.162 --> 27:02.915
that I would be a disappointment to you.

27:07.961 --> 27:11.256
That's a shit reason, I know.

27:11.256 --> 27:15.052
But maybe one day you'll have a son
and see for yourself.

27:28.398 --> 27:31.026
You got everything you need there?
I think they're waiting for us.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.782
I'm not gonna go out there with you, Jack.

27:44.248 --> 27:45.582
Good for you, kid.

27:50.712 --> 27:51.713
Good for you.

27:56.301 --> 27:58.720
<i>And now, throwing out the first pitch</i>

27:58.720 --> 28:03.600
<i>for the Vistaville Volts,
from the Brightside Lunar Residences,</i>

28:04.351 --> 28:06.144
<i>Jack Billings.</i>
