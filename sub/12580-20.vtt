[sighs happily]

00:53.019 --> 00:54.008
Hey, kid.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.987
Yaou want to hang out in the alley
until my friends get up?

00:57.090 --> 00:58.387
I'm working!

00:58.758 --> 00:59.725
Hmm.

01:17.343 --> 01:20.779
Hank, Peggy, Bobby! I just met a woman!

01:23.316 --> 01:24.840
Dale, Nancy, Joseph...

01:24.951 --> 01:27.511
I just met the woman
who will bear my children!

01:27.620 --> 01:29.884
Is this a good school district?

01:30.924 --> 01:31.891
[humming]

01:32.559 --> 01:33.685
[grunts]

01:34.360 --> 01:37.488
Boomhauer,
there's a dead wolf on your lawn.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.997
I'm lying. I met a woman!

01:40.533 --> 01:41.500
[grunts]

01:43.136 --> 01:44.831
Whoa, whoa. Yao, man.

01:45.972 --> 01:48.600
-Still here?
-I thought I'd make you breakfast.

01:49.542 --> 01:53.979
No. I got an old hang-gliding lesson, man.
I'm gonna teach this little old blind kid.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.605
I'm talking about
that old Special Olympics, too, man.

01:57.484 --> 01:58.678
[birds chirping]

02:06.759 --> 02:07.726
[exclaims]

02:09.294 --> 02:11.661
Mom, Dad, the ice cream lady's here.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.732
I need $1.50. Quick.

02:15.535 --> 02:19.437
Bobby, I don't think
the Mrs. Dippy Cone lady is on duty.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.569
Her and Mr. Boomhauer are...

02:22.542 --> 02:25.943
-dating.
-EVen better. She'll be here all the time.

02:26.045 --> 02:28.479
I can get to know her on a personal leVel.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.011
[exclaims] Maybe she'll let me do
a ride-along!

02:33.353 --> 02:36.186
Why can't Boomhauer
date someone smart for once?

02:36.289 --> 02:38.951
Like a congresswoman,
so I could get my law passed.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.058
And then she nodded like this...

02:42.162 --> 02:44.562
and then she smiled like this...

02:44.664 --> 02:46.825
and then she jogged like this.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.192
[beer sloshing]

02:48.401 --> 02:49.698
It was magic.

02:49.802 --> 02:52.464
Man, giVe it a God dang old rest.
Man, you're talking about it...

02:52.572 --> 02:56.599
just going on and on, just yack, yack, yack,
blah, blah, jogging and....

02:56.709 --> 02:58.609
-Just hush.
-Exactly.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.179
Why should we haVe to listen
to Bill blather on...

03:01.281 --> 03:04.910
about some nonexistent she-jogger
that doesn't eVen exist?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.885
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Well, let's face it.

03:07.987 --> 03:10.820
We'Ve been down
the imaginary friend road before.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.757
There were those guys
you claimed you played soccer with.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.555
Larry and Wayne.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.187
Yaou know, Larry and Wayne
may haVe been imaginary...

03:18.298 --> 03:21.233
but they were a lot more supportiVe
than you.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.494
Yaou didn't hear
what they were saying behind your back.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.771
Peggy, can I borrow a coffee cup?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.606
I need a second mug
'cause I got a lady friend now.

03:32.712 --> 03:37.206
Oh, a lady friend. Bill, that is so wonderful.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.581
Oh, no, wait. This one's dirty.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.453
GiVe it to me!

03:48.328 --> 03:51.422
Guess who had coffee
with his special lady this morning?

03:51.531 --> 03:53.965
The coffee stains on your shirt
are a nice touch, Bill...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.625
but we're still not buying.

03:55.735 --> 04:00.001
I knew you guys wouldn't belieVe me,
which is why I taped her.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.703
-I brought coffee for the two of us.
-No, thanks.

04:04.344 --> 04:07.370
If you're worried the caffeine
will make you need to move your bowels...

04:07.480 --> 04:09.209
I Iive right across the street.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.443
That's very sweet,
but I gotta keep up the pace.

04:12.552 --> 04:13.746
See you.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.648
Remember when you fell in loVe...

04:15.755 --> 04:18.519
with that speed skater
on the Wheaties box?

04:18.625 --> 04:22.459
Turns out she was real, too,
but that didn't make her your girlfriend.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.725
Look, in a perfect world,
we could both be married to Peggy.

04:25.832 --> 04:29.199
But this is reality,
and I haVe to find someone here.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.870
All right, all right, I'll do it.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.565
Bill, I'm gonna help you win her oVer.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.165
Here's a sure-fire way
to sweep her off her feet.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.371
-Yaou will tend to her wounds.
-What wounds?

04:40.480 --> 04:44.246
-The one she got from falling in the hole.
-What hole?

04:44.350 --> 04:47.285
The hole you dug in the alley.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.481
-But I didn't dig a hole in the alley.
-Not yet.

04:50.590 --> 04:51.955
Oh!

04:52.625 --> 04:53.614
Huh?

04:53.726 --> 04:57.218
Look, we will dig a minefield
of some 20-odd holes.

04:57.330 --> 05:01.266
She'll fall, twist her ankle,
and you will come to her rescue...

05:01.367 --> 05:03.665
with the first-aid kit of loVe.

05:03.770 --> 05:07.297
Bill, you'Ve got enough problems
without this lady suing you.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.965
Man, holes is dang old cheap, man.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.009
What you need is, like,
them good old rap, man.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.601
Talking about something like this.
"Yao, how you doing, baby?

05:13.713 --> 05:16.409
"Know what I'm talking about? It's gonna
take two to make it out of sight...

05:16.516 --> 05:18.006
"you know, man?"

05:18.117 --> 05:19.948
Oh, God.
Man, that dang old ball and chain.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.213
Man, coVer for me, Hank.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.518
Tell her l, like,
moVed to DenVer or something.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.315
I'm not really much of a liar.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.584
Hey.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.994
Do you know
if Boomhauer's back from his safari yet?

05:32.098 --> 05:34.726
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.893
He's.... Yaou see--

05:37.003 --> 05:40.734
He moVed to DenVer.
There, Hank, is that so hard?

05:43.976 --> 05:45.876
Wait! Wait!

05:46.179 --> 05:47.476
Come back!

05:48.247 --> 05:51.148
-She's not coming back, honey.
-Of course she is.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.309
She's Mr. Boomhauer's girlfriend.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.217
Let's see, how can I explain this?

05:56.856 --> 06:01.589
Yaou know how you can be happy eating
Vanilla ice cream day after day after day?

06:01.861 --> 06:06.730
Well, Mr. Boomhauer isn't just like that.
See, he likes to try different flaVors.

06:07.233 --> 06:11.966
But he can haVe a new flaVor eVery day.
He's dating the ice cream lady.

06:12.972 --> 06:17.170
Mr. Boomhauer had grown-up sex
with the ice cream lady...

06:17.276 --> 06:19.608
and now he's dumped her.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.704
Yaou're neVer gonna haVe
ice cream again, Bobby.

06:22.815 --> 06:23.782
[gasps]

06:24.117 --> 06:25.778
This'll be great.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.514
Nancy and I haVe been dying
for another couple to hang out with.

06:29.622 --> 06:32.785
-What about Hank and Peggy?
-Between you and me...

06:32.892 --> 06:35.793
I'Ve run out of things to say
to that woman.

06:47.273 --> 06:50.572
-Oh!
-I'll help you, ma'am.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.244
[yells]

06:52.478 --> 06:53.740
I'm down.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.272
My name is....

06:57.383 --> 06:58.350

06:59.318 --> 07:01.309
Just tell me where it....

07:01.421 --> 07:02.581
[yelling]

07:04.557 --> 07:05.922
(Bill) Damn it!

07:07.960 --> 07:10.451
Here we go.
We're just gonna get you inside, man.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.963
Man, just go ahead
and you just keep them ankles eleVated.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.362
I'm gonna help you out now.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.458
Please, come back.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.434
No, wait.

07:20.506 --> 07:21.905
[Thank Yaou playing]

07:22.275 --> 07:23.640

07:26.813 --> 07:27.905
[car horn honking]

07:28.347 --> 07:29.575
[moaning]

07:36.722 --> 07:41.182
Well, I see she's a bit of a hellcat.
Scratched you up good.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.287
After all I did for her,
all these holes I dug...

07:45.398 --> 07:46.729
he just comes in here with his...

07:46.833 --> 07:50.098
"dang old this" and his "dang old that"
and he steals her away from me!

07:50.203 --> 07:51.727
-Hank?
-No.

07:51.838 --> 07:52.896
Boomhauer.

07:53.005 --> 07:56.634
All he's gonna do is giVe her one night
of marathon loVemaking...

07:56.742 --> 07:59.336
I would haVe giVen her
the same amount of loVe...

07:59.445 --> 08:01.879
but stretched out oVer a lifetime.

08:04.684 --> 08:08.848
I usually run fiVe miles eVery morning,
but I think that counts.

08:10.189 --> 08:11.417
[birds chirping]

08:14.093 --> 08:17.290
Hey, man,
just put it on my dang old account, man.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.324
How could you, Boomhauer?

08:19.432 --> 08:20.399
[yells]

08:21.534 --> 08:23.297
[groans]

08:24.103 --> 08:25.161
I loVe her!

08:25.271 --> 08:27.831
But to you,
she's just another notch in your belt.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.965
Yaeah, I tell you what, man,
you dug your own graVe...

08:30.076 --> 08:32.408
when you dug them
dang old potholes, man.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.707
Fellows, Bobby's trying to nap.

08:34.813 --> 08:39.114
This stupid jerk stole my woman!
I haVe neVer done that to you.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.982
Dang it, Boomhauer.
Now we'll neVer hear the end of this.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.249
No. Yaou will not hear the end of this.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.990
Hey, Boomhauer,
here comes that lady jogger.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.223
Oh, man. Dang old DenVer, man.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.191
[whistles]

08:57.303 --> 08:58.964
A Jaguar.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.133
Man, you're talking about
a dang old sweet ride.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.971
Man, you got a fully synchronized
four-speed with cast housing...

09:05.077 --> 09:07.545
and dang old diaphragm clutch, man.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.374
I'm Bill DauteriVe.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.009
And I'd be honored
if I could haVe some of your hair...

09:14.120 --> 09:15.382
for my collection.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.082
-What are you doing?
-I am flirting.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.755
I didn't know you liked classic cars.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.056
Then again, the only thing
I do know about you...

09:24.163 --> 09:26.063
-is where you're ticklish.
-I tell you what, man.

09:26.165 --> 09:29.726
Why don't we go on back to my place,
you gonna make me laugh?

09:35.775 --> 09:37.800
Go, Boomhauer!

09:37.910 --> 09:40.435
Sorry, Bill, but I gotta back a winner.

09:40.546 --> 09:44.642
Please, don't put on Dido.
Please, don't put on Dido.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.375
[music playing]

09:46.485 --> 09:48.350
Oh, Dido!

09:48.454 --> 09:49.819
[whimpering]

09:53.225 --> 09:54.522
And then I said, "l know you.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.288
"Yaou're the weatherman
from Channel 7, right?"

09:56.395 --> 09:57.657
And then he says, "No, I'm not."

09:57.763 --> 10:00.027
And then I said,
"What are you talking about?

10:00.132 --> 10:02.327
"Of course, it's you. Yaou are that guy."

10:02.435 --> 10:06.098
And he said, "No, I am not."
And you know what? It wasn't.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.539
Hank, why aren't you in the alley?
Is it raining?

10:08.641 --> 10:12.133
Oh, speaking of rain,
I ran into this guy today....

10:12.244 --> 10:15.509
Oh! I can't listen to this story again!

10:15.748 --> 10:18.308
I got to walk eight blocks
to Carter's Market now...

10:18.417 --> 10:22.217
and get my ice cream.
Why am I in the middle of this?

10:23.956 --> 10:27.687
I bet Bobby wishes Boomhauer dumped
the asparagus lady.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.760
[laughs]

10:32.098 --> 10:35.158
There's not really
an asparagus lady, Peggy.

10:35.267 --> 10:38.100
-It's funny.
-Oh! Oh, okay.

10:38.204 --> 10:42.573
So you think Boomhauer's
promiscuity is amusing?

10:43.009 --> 10:44.977
-Not really.
-"Not really"?

10:45.077 --> 10:47.910
So, what then?
Do his stories entertain you?

10:48.014 --> 10:50.574
Does hearing about his bedroom antics
excite you?

10:50.683 --> 10:53.675
-ls that how you get your freak on?
-My what?

10:53.786 --> 10:55.413
No. No!

10:55.521 --> 10:57.682
I, l....

10:57.957 --> 10:59.356
I loVe you.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.427
I'll leaVe you alone
with your dirty thoughts.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.224
Yaeah, you know,
the minute I turned 18, man...

11:07.333 --> 11:08.823
my little old mama saying, you know...

11:08.934 --> 11:10.902
"Get into....
Go into electrical engineering, Boomhauer.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.972
"Dang old make me proud," you know?
But I just don't do it, man.

11:14.073 --> 11:17.236
Thank goodness.
Engineers are way too uptight.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.745
Yaou wanna do some shots?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.178
Ooh!

11:31.290 --> 11:33.349
Dang old.... Dang.

11:36.562 --> 11:37.893
There's OJ in the fridge.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.295
Make yourself a little something to eat.
Take a swim.

11:40.399 --> 11:45.132
Just do me a faVor and press "actiVate"
to set the alarm on your way out, okay?

11:45.404 --> 11:46.428
Bye.

11:47.973 --> 11:48.940
[door closing]

12:00.386 --> 12:01.751
Dang old....

12:07.827 --> 12:11.456
Yao, Hank. Hank, man.
Hey, man, talking about it's me, man.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.225
Dang old Boomhauer, man.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.259
Huh.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.304
I just turned on the backyard grill
from the swimming pool.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.000
And Peggy said
man would neVer be able to do that.

12:23.876 --> 12:26.902
Boomhauer,
this is the coolest fling you'Ve eVer had.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.947
Oh, yeah, man. Dang old cool fling, man.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.017
I was using the master bathroom...

12:32.118 --> 12:35.019
which, by the way,
I should haVe been master of...

12:35.121 --> 12:36.520
and I found this.

12:36.622 --> 12:39.056
Hey, man.
Put them little old things back!

12:39.158 --> 12:41.888
For a rich woman,
she buys pretty flimsy underwear.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.689
Where's her ass supposed to go?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.063
No!

12:45.698 --> 12:47.893
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:49.568 --> 12:50.535
[grunts]

12:50.970 --> 12:52.870
This is a digital watch.

12:52.972 --> 12:56.669
I could haVe been electrocuted.
I'm neVer talking to you again.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.939
Yaeah, I tell you what, man.
I tell you, just.... Good riddance, man.

13:00.045 --> 13:04.209
Yaou're not normally so touchy
about your girlfriends' unmentionables.

13:04.316 --> 13:08.412
-Yaou getting serious with this gal?
-Oh, man, what are you....

13:08.521 --> 13:09.920
What are you guys doing here?

13:10.022 --> 13:12.490
Oh, man. I'm sorry, baby.
Yaou know, I just....

13:12.591 --> 13:13.580
Hot day, you know.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.990
I thought, maybe,
I'd inVite a couple of my friends oVer, man.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.824
It's my bad. Yaeah, I'm sorry, man.

13:19.131 --> 13:23.192
I'm not leaVing without my urine.
I left it sitting in the toilet.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.403
[ice clinking]

13:27.840 --> 13:29.501
Oh, thank you, baby.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.076
Why don't you go on ahead,
and make yourself one, too?

13:32.511 --> 13:35.605
I'm sorry. Did you forget something?

13:35.714 --> 13:37.807
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Yaou need to go ahead.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.147
Go ahead and unwind, man, I'm sorry.
Yaou got my digits.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.652
Yaou just go ahead and you call me.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.515
[birds chirping]

13:45.424 --> 13:47.654
I saw this news promo last night...

13:47.760 --> 13:50.228
that said something's going on
in restaurant kitchens...

13:50.329 --> 13:53.924
that might really surprise us,
but then I fell asleep.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.591
Boomhauer, you stay up late.

13:55.701 --> 13:59.694
Are rude customers really getting more
than they bargained for?

13:59.805 --> 14:02.899
Ring, man.
Come on, baby, please, man, don't....

14:05.644 --> 14:08.374
Now, talking about, it's been nearly....
It's been two days, man.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.710
I don't feel like.... A dang old lifetime, man.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.614
I remember when I fell in loVe with Peggy.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.477
I'll neVer forget that first handshake.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.958
-I wanted it to last foreVer.
-LoVe, man? That's what this is, man?

14:21.060 --> 14:23.051
Talking about, old pit of my stomach, man.

14:23.162 --> 14:26.791
And I don't know if I'm coming or going.
I'm getting out of my mind, man.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.526
LoVe? Me?

14:32.972 --> 14:34.496
Hey, dang old Mee-Maw.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.472
[gibbering]

14:36.642 --> 14:38.906
What, Mee-Maw? I didn't....

14:43.782 --> 14:47.479
Little Boomhauer.... Coming up.
HaVen't seen you in so long.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.048
Now, Mee-Maw, family matriarch....

14:52.157 --> 14:55.422
And, well, it's about time
I'm gonna ask you for that dang old ring.

14:55.527 --> 14:56.892
Oh, Boomhauer!

14:56.996 --> 15:00.557
Yaou.... Talking about, I thought I was
gonna be buried with the dang old thing.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.429
Yaou little old.... Wow.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.170
[dog barking]

15:13.812 --> 15:15.143
[doorbell ringing]

15:15.414 --> 15:19.282
All right, all right.
It's a pizza, not a kidney.

15:22.454 --> 15:25.582
-Boomhauser?
-Marlene, I dang old....

15:25.691 --> 15:28.387
I can't stand being apart from you,
not one moment longer, man.

15:28.494 --> 15:32.555
I'm talking about, just like this ring.
It ain't got no beginning and no end, man.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.860
Okay. I'm gonna be honest with you.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.595
I only understand
about half of what you say.

15:37.703 --> 15:41.161
The other times I just nod and smile
and wait for your pants to come off.

15:41.273 --> 15:44.367
What I'm talking about, Marlene,
is dang old....

15:44.476 --> 15:47.912
-Won't you marry me?
-Whoa, I understood that.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.379
I see the pizza guy,
but I don't see the pizza.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.517
[Marlene giggling]

15:52.618 --> 15:54.813
[Marlene giggling]

15:54.920 --> 15:56.080
SteVen.

15:57.389 --> 16:01.382
Yaeah, that's cool, baby.
Plenty of dang old fish in the sea, man.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.594
[music playing on car radio]

16:07.967 --> 16:09.161
[tires screeching]

16:09.635 --> 16:10.897
[sobbing]

16:13.272 --> 16:15.263
Dang old....

16:18.444 --> 16:20.742
-Yaep.
-Yaep.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.213
Yaep.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.375
Oh, dang old. Come on, Marlene, man.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.748
Come on, man,
talking about them old times, man.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.946
Barbecue sauce.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.022
[voices Iaughing]

16:31.857 --> 16:33.586
Yaep, I know that sound.

16:33.692 --> 16:37.287
She's got you on the office speaker phone.
Yaou're a loser!

16:37.396 --> 16:38.795
[chuckling]

16:42.601 --> 16:43.693
[sobbing]

16:43.869 --> 16:44.893
Come on, Boomhauer.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.905
Yaou're still the same old tomcat
you always were.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.306
Hey, tell us that story
about the girl from the Radio Shack.

16:51.410 --> 16:54.345
Yaou know, "l was buying batteries...."

16:54.813 --> 16:55.939
Yaeah. Yaeah, okay.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.573
Well, you know,
my dang old Norelco died...

16:58.684 --> 17:02.176
and I went out to get me some of them
old triple A's, you know? So l....

17:02.287 --> 17:05.450
Oh, God. Marlene.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.323
Boo-hoo-hoo-hauer.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.328
I bet now you wish you'd only slept
with 100 ladies...

17:11.430 --> 17:13.397
instead of 101.

17:13.499 --> 17:17.367
Now you know how they all felt,
except for that one that did it to you!

17:20.305 --> 17:24.173
Bill is picking on Boomhauer?
He hasn't done that since he had hair.

17:24.276 --> 17:27.803
We gotta do something.
The alley was balanced before.

17:27.913 --> 17:30.939
A cool single guy,
and a cool married guy...

17:31.050 --> 17:34.042
a loser single guy,
and a loser married guy.

17:34.153 --> 17:37.953
-Now, it's me and three losers!
-Dale, go sign out with Nancy.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.424
We're going tomcatting,
and I'm gonna need a wing man.

17:41.527 --> 17:42.755
Got you.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.363
Wait.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.830
If you think for one second,
that I'm gonna stand by...

17:47.933 --> 17:50.094
while you go on a floozy hunt
for Boomhauer, why--

17:50.202 --> 17:53.194
Peggy, do you want another Bill
on your hands?

17:54.373 --> 17:56.136
Take my car. It's a chick magnet.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.236
Boomhauer, where do the girls hang out?

18:00.345 --> 18:02.438
Nursing school, magic store?

18:02.581 --> 18:03.548
[sobbing]

18:06.118 --> 18:09.451
-Hey, there's a woman.
-All right.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.419
Do that thing
where you compliment them...

18:13.525 --> 18:15.789
-and they come home with you.
-Yaeah, yeah, yeah.

18:15.894 --> 18:18.362
I once told Peggy her hair looked nice.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.295
She still mentions it.

18:23.168 --> 18:26.035
She's hugging him. Look at him go, Hank.

18:26.138 --> 18:29.665
-Don't look at me. Look at them.
-He's bringing her back.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.608
Pretend you're asleep
so they can make out.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.873
Yaou guys should get
this poor fellow back to bed...

18:35.981 --> 18:37.846
after what that cold-blooded witch did.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.215
Oh, turning down his grandma's ring.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.048
[sobbing]

18:46.492 --> 18:47.686
[sniffling]

18:53.265 --> 18:54.493
Oh, man.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.134
There, there.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.131
[footsteps approaching]

19:02.107 --> 19:03.369
Amateurs!

19:03.976 --> 19:04.943
[grunting]

19:07.846 --> 19:08.835
[sighing]

19:08.947 --> 19:10.881
Thank God we're married.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.042
Yaeah. It's rough out there.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.856
I know how dark it is for you right now.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.859
Curled up,
lying in your own emotional Vomit.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.827
Yaou're in hell now, Boomhauer.

19:26.265 --> 19:29.496
And the only way out
is through a long, dark tunnel.

19:29.801 --> 19:34.295
And you're afraid to go in
because there's a train coming at you...

19:34.406 --> 19:37.068
carrying a boxcar full of heartbreak.

19:37.176 --> 19:41.340
Well, let me tell you something,
all you can do is let it hit you...

19:41.446 --> 19:43.471
and then try to find your legs.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.042
I know.

19:46.151 --> 19:49.416
I'Ve taken that hit more times
than I can remember.

19:50.255 --> 19:53.691
Look at me, Boomhauer.
I'm fat, and I'm old...

19:53.792 --> 19:56.920
and eVery day I'm just gonna wake up
fatter and older.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.294
But, somehow, I manage to drag
this fat old bald bastard...

20:00.399 --> 20:02.128
out into the alley eVery day.

20:02.234 --> 20:05.226
I'm out there
digging holes, falling into them...

20:05.337 --> 20:06.998
climbing out, trying again.

20:07.105 --> 20:11.098
And tomorrow
I'm gonna hang outside at a lady's prison.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.203
And the first thing those lady cons
are gonna see after 20 years...

20:15.314 --> 20:16.576
is me.

20:16.682 --> 20:20.812
Will I get one? Experience says no.
Will I be out there next month?

20:20.919 --> 20:22.978
If I'm aliVe, you better belieVe it.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.852
Yaou gotta get right back up
on that tanning bed...

20:25.958 --> 20:29.189
slip into a tight T-shirt,
wash off some of that cologne...

20:29.294 --> 20:33.924
and get yourself out of that tunnel
and into some strange woman's bed!

20:34.032 --> 20:35.124
-Hell, yeah, man.
-Yaeah!

20:35.234 --> 20:37.031
-Dang right, man!
-That's what I'm talking about!

20:37.135 --> 20:39.103
-Get out there, boy!
-Yaeah, yeah.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.195
Yaeah! Yaeah! Yaeah!

Very happy...

20:54.186 --> 20:56.154
then Very, Very sad.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.745
What you got, Boomhauer?

20:57.856 --> 21:01.087
A hot date

21:01.193 --> 21:05.129
No, man. I ain't ready to get back
on my dang old horse just yet, man.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.063
I got a little old business
I need to do first, man.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.397
Boomhauer?

21:12.671 --> 21:15.435

21:49.675 --> 21:53.668
-So, what were you in for?
-Killed my boyfriend.
