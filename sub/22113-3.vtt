Please don't shoot me, please don't.

00:03.218 --> 00:04.693
- You're mine now.
- Glenn, how long

00:04.718 --> 00:06.899
- have you been on this island?
- About five years.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.324
Is there something
you're not telling me?

00:08.426 --> 00:11.427
There was a horrible virus,
and we're all that's left.

00:11.529 --> 00:14.096
- Carol!
- Tandy! (LAUGHS)

00:14.198 --> 00:15.795
GLENN: You guys just
gonna leave her here?

00:15.820 --> 00:16.966
CAROL: Fine, she can come.

00:17.068 --> 00:18.434
But on one condition.

00:18.536 --> 00:20.636
Thank you! You won't regret this!

00:24.566 --> 00:26.666
And you're done.

00:26.768 --> 00:28.668
Ah. Great. Whew!

00:28.770 --> 00:31.007
Wow, that feels wonderful. Thank you.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.229
So, how much longer till we get there?

00:32.332 --> 00:34.699
Uh, well, at this speed,
probably about a week.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.640
- Seriously?
- What? Shut up. - Why?

00:36.665 --> 00:39.404
I would like to get there
faster, but, to do that safely,

00:39.506 --> 00:42.073
you're gonna have to
rethink the Pamela situation.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.908
Oh, God. Help me.

00:44.010 --> 00:47.111
(SQUEALING): Help me,
God. Oh, God. Oh...

00:47.214 --> 00:49.614
Pamela stays right where she is.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.150
Yeah, we have a saying: you
do the crime, you do the time.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.871
GAIL: Damn it, y'all.

00:53.896 --> 00:55.987
I left my sunglasses back on the island.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.322
Can we go back?

00:57.424 --> 00:59.362
Just get some new ones in Mexico.

00:59.387 --> 01:00.925
No, they were my faves.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.660
I know right where I left them.

01:03.057 --> 01:05.697
They are right over there.

01:08.171 --> 01:09.400
Oh, balls.

01:09.502 --> 01:11.469
Let me see those.

01:15.742 --> 01:19.143
Uh, you know what, maybe
we should head back.

(PAMELA GROANS)

01:31.842 --> 01:33.141
Hello.

01:33.243 --> 01:35.636
Sorry, I lost my grip
when my fingers went numb.

01:35.661 --> 01:39.003
Oh, the same fingers that
adult-napped my husband?

01:39.249 --> 01:40.511
Back in the raft.

01:40.536 --> 01:43.351
Guys, I know you have your
little punishment policy...

01:43.453 --> 01:44.953
- DTC, DTT.
- But, uh,

01:45.055 --> 01:47.856
I think we'd move a lot faster
if Pamela could ride with us.

01:47.958 --> 01:49.274
Oh, ho, ho.

01:49.299 --> 01:51.132
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.844
I would. I really would.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.379
GAIL: Look, Carol, I'm
still pissed at her, too,

01:54.481 --> 01:56.515
but I'm dying to get off this damn boat,

01:56.617 --> 01:59.851
so maybe we should just
bite the bullet on this one.

02:00.210 --> 02:01.661
MELISSA: Yeah, I mean, we
shouldn't all have to suffer

02:01.686 --> 02:02.654
because Pamela sucks.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.655
Right?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.584

(SIGHS)

02:08.186 --> 02:08.937
Fine.

02:09.371 --> 02:11.106
But just know that you're on thin ice,

02:11.131 --> 02:13.031
and I'm holding a welding torch.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.366
(MIMICS TORCH)

02:14.468 --> 02:16.198
Thank you. Thank you so much.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.904
I know I have behaved terribly,

02:17.929 --> 02:19.963
and I promise I will earn
my place on this boat.

02:20.065 --> 02:22.465
I will be the lowest of
the lows. The waitstaff.

02:22.567 --> 02:24.000
So, Todd, you're excused.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.989
Prepare to be pampered!

02:26.014 --> 02:28.805
You gave me a second chance!
I'm not gonna waste it!

02:28.907 --> 02:30.540
A-And don't worry!
I-I know what to do!

02:30.642 --> 02:32.542

Oh, man, just wait till you see it.

They say the boardwalk is a must-see

02:43.088 --> 02:45.788

02:45.890 --> 02:48.324
The perfect spot for our honeymoon.

(AS ANDY): But let's
promise not to talk like this

02:50.328 --> 02:51.569
when we're making love.

02:51.594 --> 02:55.031
Oh, you know I can't
make that promise, Andy.

02:55.738 --> 02:58.472
Hi. Well, I just finished
cleaning the anchor.

02:58.497 --> 03:00.837
Would anyone care for a
dinnertime foot massage?

03:00.939 --> 03:03.012
Todd? Melissa? No?

03:03.037 --> 03:05.074
- Tandy?
- Uh, uh...

No? Carol, how 'bout you?

No? Hard no?

Swedish, Shiatsu, Thai?

03:45.483 --> 03:47.717
Definite no. Gail?

03:47.819 --> 03:49.419
Hard no. Erica?

03:49.521 --> 03:50.420
All right.

03:50.445 --> 03:53.012
Glenn, still good?

03:53.191 --> 03:55.291
Okay, well, I'm off to scrub the decks.

03:55.393 --> 03:57.627

mind, please wash your feet.

03:57.729 --> 03:59.629
No, leave them dirty.

03:59.731 --> 04:01.698
I deserve it.

prostrate herself like this?

04:07.544 --> 04:08.548
GAIL: I don't know.

04:08.573 --> 04:10.973
How long was she gonna
leave us on that damn island?

04:11.076 --> 04:12.642
- Yeah.
- CAROL: I still don't trust her.

04:12.744 --> 04:15.421
You all saw how she
casually offered my husband

04:15.446 --> 04:17.079
a foot massage.

04:17.103 --> 04:20.750
Everybody knows that the foot
is the gateway to the leg.

- You're a really good cook.
- Oh.

05:01.426 --> 05:05.795
I was a single dad, so I kind of
know my way around a can opener.

05:05.897 --> 05:07.463
You have...

05:07.565 --> 05:09.090
had...

05:10.348 --> 05:13.636
Tell me about your kids.

05:13.738 --> 05:15.505
(SIGHS): Oh.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.039
A girl, Penny.

05:17.142 --> 05:20.143
Two boys, uh, Tommy and Doug.

05:20.245 --> 05:21.611
Good kids.

05:21.713 --> 05:23.379
Smart.

05:23.481 --> 05:24.981
Two gay, one not.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.649
Oh.

05:26.674 --> 05:27.973
Apples of my eye.

05:31.089 --> 05:34.490
It's... pretty risky for
you to be talking to me.

05:34.592 --> 05:36.492
I'm kind of toxic around here.

05:36.938 --> 05:39.495
If someone comes, you should
just start barking orders at me.

05:39.597 --> 05:41.731
I'll know it's not
really you. (CHUCKLES)

05:41.833 --> 05:44.700
I'm not worried about what they think.

05:47.188 --> 05:49.138
Why are you so nice to me?

05:49.813 --> 05:53.267
I know what it's like
to be alone for years.

05:53.292 --> 05:56.746
It can make you do some
pretty crazy things.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.849
I made a lover out of palm fronds.

05:59.951 --> 06:01.217
- Oh.
- (CHUCKLES)

06:01.242 --> 06:05.010
Anyway, I'm really in
no position to judge.

06:05.127 --> 06:07.167
Wow. If this was the old
me, I would have you pinned

06:07.192 --> 06:08.524
against that railing right now,

06:08.626 --> 06:12.161
slick and wet with slobber.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.399
But, you know, that was the past.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.100
We're not those people anymore.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.535
We've-we've changed.

06:19.637 --> 06:20.870
Changed.

06:37.022 --> 06:37.987
Good morning.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.489
Does anyone need their hair combed?

06:39.524 --> 06:40.712
(CHUCKLES)

06:40.737 --> 06:43.238
We can comb our own hair, thank you.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.728
- Right. I'm sorry for asking.
- Hey, Pamela,

06:45.764 --> 06:48.565
do you know who was making
all that racket last night?

06:48.600 --> 06:51.668
'Cause it sure sounded
like you and Glenn.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.504
Me and Glenn.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.639
Last night. Yes.

06:56.675 --> 07:01.211
Glenn had me doing some really
loud chores all night long.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.512
Real hard labor.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.014
Um, and we just both
collapsed from exhaustion...

07:05.050 --> 07:08.241
I mean, him from the ordering
and me from all the choring.

07:08.266 --> 07:12.055
Then, at dawn, he woke me
for one final chore session.

07:12.090 --> 07:16.192
I mean, he has the stamina of...

07:16.228 --> 07:18.833
someone who really likes to...

07:18.858 --> 07:20.924
order a lot of chores.

07:20.949 --> 07:23.568
He can find lots of things for me to do.

07:23.593 --> 07:25.201
Well, if you were just doing chores,

07:25.237 --> 07:26.936
then why did you keep screaming,

07:26.972 --> 07:31.207
"Wow! Wow! Wow!"?

07:31.243 --> 07:34.677
Because he showed me
how to use the ShamWow.

07:34.713 --> 07:37.213
(LAUGHING): And I
sometimes have a habit of

07:37.249 --> 07:39.515
saying the name of the
thing that I'm using.

07:39.551 --> 07:42.518
You know, like, comb, comb,
deodorant, toilet. (CHUCKLES)

07:42.554 --> 07:45.221
- Well, next time, keep a lid on it.
- I will, I promise.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.760
I will bite a pillow, a leather belt.

07:46.785 --> 07:48.925
I'll put one of those
black balls in my mouth.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.573
(LAUGHS) Anything I can do
to earn your forgiveness.

07:51.598 --> 07:53.465
All right, back to work!

07:59.843 --> 08:01.137

08:01.297 --> 08:03.431
Glenn, what if someone see us?

08:03.968 --> 08:06.542
Hey, come with me.

08:06.578 --> 08:09.279
- Where are we going?
- They're having a little party.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.381
Glenn, I wasn't invited.

08:11.416 --> 08:14.482
Hey, if I can't bring my girlfriend,

08:14.654 --> 08:17.086
then it's a party I don't want to go.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.588

10:34.084 --> 10:36.050
News flash... it's bluer.

10:36.086 --> 10:39.187
Yup, yup. I mean, this is
even better than I pictured it.

10:39.596 --> 10:43.264
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

10:43.927 --> 10:46.060
Your bags, sir!

10:46.096 --> 10:47.895
(QUIETLY): I see you took my advice.

10:47.931 --> 10:50.565
Treat me like dog dirt so the
others don't find out about us.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.302
You're being very believable,
which I find very sexy.

10:54.337 --> 10:55.837
Please wait by the road.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.371
Very well, sir!

10:57.407 --> 10:59.474
Oh, you're so hard on me.

10:59.509 --> 11:01.809
You couldn't care less about me.

11:01.845 --> 11:03.978
Work, work, work.

11:07.566 --> 11:08.583
PAMELA: Hey.

11:08.618 --> 11:10.585
The coast is clear.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.587
(AS AUSTIN POWERS):
You want to shag, baby?

11:13.672 --> 11:15.772
(LAUGHS) Austin Powers.

11:15.797 --> 11:17.008
All right, that'll be all.

11:17.033 --> 11:18.593
Run along.

11:18.628 --> 11:20.242
Oh. You're a very good actor.

11:20.267 --> 11:21.915
Really committing to this role.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.765
- It's not a role.
- Oh.

11:24.801 --> 11:26.767
Sorry, part. Performance?

11:26.803 --> 11:29.438
Act. I meant act. Role?

11:29.463 --> 11:32.073
This is real. I made a mistake.

11:32.529 --> 11:34.596
Now please just go.

11:37.528 --> 11:39.595
(VOICE BREAKING): Very well, sir.

11:41.929 --> 11:44.785
- So, obviously, we need a home.
- Uh-huh.

11:44.813 --> 11:48.574
And I saw this place, and
I was like, "Yes, please."

11:48.796 --> 11:50.996
- Ready?
- Yeah.

11:51.434 --> 11:53.094
Ta-da!

11:53.942 --> 11:55.530
What do you think?

11:55.996 --> 11:57.231
Huh.

11:58.293 --> 11:59.375
CAROL: I-I know.

11:59.402 --> 12:01.189
It's an upper-from-which-fixer,

12:01.220 --> 12:04.289
but it has medical stuff
for when I go into labor.

12:04.314 --> 12:07.525
- And I have so many decorating ideas.
- Oh.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.485
I mean, first of all... no brainer...

12:10.510 --> 12:12.485
get the dead bodies out of here.

12:12.510 --> 12:14.796
Think we might have gone to
the same decorating school.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.568
Next, we need a statement piece.

12:17.593 --> 12:18.803
My idea?

12:18.838 --> 12:20.747
A bedpathelier.

12:20.772 --> 12:23.774
You're probably way ahead of me
on this, but it's a chandelier

12:23.810 --> 12:26.210
made out of bedpans...

12:26.791 --> 12:27.845
and catheters.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.213
(CAROL CHUCKLES)

12:29.248 --> 12:31.549
Then, we take these sheets,

12:31.877 --> 12:34.110
bleach out the stool and the blood,

12:34.135 --> 12:35.853
and we're in picture window city.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.189
(LAUGHING): It is gonna be so...

12:41.576 --> 12:42.827
great.

12:43.214 --> 12:45.347
This is what I love about you, Carol.

12:45.372 --> 12:46.664
I mean, you see potential

12:46.699 --> 12:48.833
in even the biggest pile of crap.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.569
- I don't know about that.
- Well, I do.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.704
'Cause I'm saying that as a former pile.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.239
Look, I love it.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.474
I am in so hard.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.120
(STAMMERS) So where do we start?

12:59.050 --> 13:02.213
Well, I think I want to
start in the courtyard.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.605
And if it's okay,

13:05.630 --> 13:08.063
I need to do this one on my own.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.329
You know what? I want to make a toast.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.733
Thank you, Zihuatanejo,

13:22.046 --> 13:25.140
for making me "see what an A-ho"

13:25.500 --> 13:28.038
I've been for not getting here sooner.

13:28.302 --> 13:29.935
But you know what? I'm here now.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.993
And talk about living up to the hype.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.605
I mean, come on. Will
somebody pinch me, please?

13:34.630 --> 13:36.972
I mean, Melissa, please,
pinch me, would you?

13:36.997 --> 13:38.282
- I'm not gonna pinch you.
- Okay, well, then,

13:38.317 --> 13:40.217
I'm jumping on my own grenade here.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.720
It's just... (GROANS, LAUGHS)

13:42.755 --> 13:46.051
(TODD GROANS AND LAUGHS LOUDLY)

13:46.076 --> 13:47.458
No, it didn't work.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.293
It still feels like a dream.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.961
And not a dry one.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.429
- TODD: Oh.
- GAIL: Oh.- ERICA: Ew.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.366
I love this place! Shawshank lives!

13:55.401 --> 13:57.368
Yeah!

14:00.852 --> 14:02.919
Can we help you with something?

14:03.952 --> 14:04.973
PAMELA: Uh...

14:04.998 --> 14:06.877
I'm here for dinner.

14:07.186 --> 14:09.841
Well, this party is BYOB,

14:09.866 --> 14:12.730
which stands for,
"Bye, You Old Buttface."

14:12.980 --> 14:15.386
I'll have you know, I was invited.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.755
Really? By who?

14:18.168 --> 14:19.757
By <i> whom.</i>

14:21.246 --> 14:22.660
<i>(BELL TOLLS)</i>

14:25.658 --> 14:27.565
And that whom is me.

14:28.610 --> 14:31.969
Look, we all know that
Pamela is a real jerk.

14:31.994 --> 14:32.970
Fair assessment.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.806
I mean, she kidnapped a
person. She's a stinkin' felon.

14:35.841 --> 14:37.808
- I am, yes.
- She left a new mom,

14:37.843 --> 14:40.411
a baby, a mother-to-be
stranded on an island.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.246
- Left 'em for dead, yup.
- She's just been

14:42.281 --> 14:44.582
horrible, irredeemable scum.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.917
Objection! Overruled. I'll allow it.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.956
- Even her dog hates her.
- He does.

14:48.981 --> 14:53.857
In short, Pamela was a real
piece of Sit Here In Tijuana.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.926
- Care Bear!
- I'm sorry, Tandy.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.262
I know that coarse language isn't me,

14:58.591 --> 15:00.931
but neither is giving up on a person.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.101
And that is exactly what I did.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.136
It's what we all did.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.938
And that's not us.

15:08.197 --> 15:10.030
We can do better than that.

15:10.055 --> 15:12.024
And so can she.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.239
So what do you say we
give her another chance?

15:19.647 --> 15:21.047
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:21.084 --> 15:22.353
Pass.

15:23.350 --> 15:25.302
PAMELA: What is your problem?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.730
We had something.

15:26.755 --> 15:27.857
I felt it.

15:27.882 --> 15:29.902
I felt it on the bow.
I felt it on the stern.

15:29.927 --> 15:31.301
Then a few more times on the bow.

15:31.326 --> 15:32.396
Then the stern again.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.784
Then you flipped me over
on to my starboard side.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.809
I even tried aft for the first time.

15:37.391 --> 15:39.359
I know you felt it, too.

15:39.556 --> 15:41.572
You were just a vacation fling.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.040
What changed in you?

15:43.075 --> 15:45.075
Was it the sex? I've
always been bad at it.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.410
Tentative, immobile.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.245
I need to learn to use my arms more.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.580
I just can't do this.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.315
Wait. Glenn.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.400
Tell me you don't feel anything.

15:53.425 --> 15:54.724
Go on, tell me.

15:54.749 --> 15:55.652
Tell me that, Glenn!

15:55.677 --> 15:56.976
Tell me you don't feel anything!

15:57.001 --> 15:58.468
Damn it, tell me!

16:00.382 --> 16:03.059
Why are you trying so
hard to make me hate you?

16:03.442 --> 16:04.862
Because I love you.

16:06.082 --> 16:07.331
I love you, too.

16:07.356 --> 16:09.533
And I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.602
So why are you treating me like this?

16:12.410 --> 16:14.171
Because I'm leaving tomorrow.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.525
PAMELA: So you're leaving.

16:31.265 --> 16:34.567
(SIGHS) Seeing that beach today,

16:34.905 --> 16:38.804
and what my kids went
through without me...

16:38.840 --> 16:41.006
I have to go home.

16:41.965 --> 16:45.044
There's radiation everywhere.

16:45.234 --> 16:48.502
You know you'll probably die.

16:49.949 --> 16:52.184
They're my kids.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.693
So it wasn't our sex?

17:01.306 --> 17:03.297
Pamela.

17:04.510 --> 17:07.233
Our sex was the second best

17:07.268 --> 17:09.367
I've ever had.

17:11.432 --> 17:13.632
Oh, Glenn.

17:13.941 --> 17:16.909
I'll always remember that you said that.

17:28.044 --> 17:30.311
Oh, hey.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.291
Todd, I know you're not okay.

17:32.669 --> 17:35.227
I know Zihuat's not what you expected.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.493
But I think I know a way to help.

17:38.688 --> 17:41.823
You know the final scene
of <i> Shawshank?</i>

17:41.936 --> 17:43.602
- Uh-huh.
- Well,

17:44.127 --> 17:47.306
they didn't film that in Zihuatanejo.

17:47.341 --> 17:49.328
(LAUGHS)

17:49.353 --> 17:51.211
Get out of town, okay?

17:51.236 --> 17:52.878
Go fishin'.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.915
They shot that in Saint Croix.

17:57.883 --> 17:59.285
Tax credits.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.586
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

18:03.414 --> 18:04.713
Are you serious?

18:05.526 --> 18:06.659
Yeah.

18:07.193 --> 18:08.327
(QUIETLY): Boy, damn.

18:08.362 --> 18:11.597
Damn you, Zihuatanejo!

18:11.632 --> 18:13.065
You lied to me!

18:13.100 --> 18:15.401
All of you!

18:15.436 --> 18:20.377
The entire production team of <i>
The Shawshank Redemption.</i>

18:20.893 --> 18:22.007
Cast, crew,

18:22.043 --> 18:23.943
(CRYING): and most certainly locations,

18:23.978 --> 18:27.279
you've all got blood on your hands.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.315
Everyone.

18:32.853 --> 18:34.954
Everyone except for you.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.626
(SNIFFLES)

18:41.147 --> 18:43.295
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for acting so crazy.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.698
I just, you know, I just...

18:46.006 --> 18:49.168
God, I just wanted it
to be perfect for you.

18:49.404 --> 18:50.756
No. Don't you see,

18:50.781 --> 18:53.606
as long as I'm with you,
any place is perfect.

19:02.738 --> 19:04.149
GLENN: Okay, well,

19:04.185 --> 19:06.118
I guess that's about it.

19:06.153 --> 19:08.454
Hey.

19:08.489 --> 19:11.857
Ta-ta for now, you hear?

19:11.892 --> 19:13.792
You guys haven't seen Pamela, have you?

19:13.828 --> 19:15.060
CAROL: Oh, Glenn,

19:15.096 --> 19:17.963
you have to understand,
this is really hard for her.

19:18.947 --> 19:20.966
Well, just tell her I'm gonna miss her.

19:21.002 --> 19:22.735
PAMELA: No, you won't.

19:24.309 --> 19:25.709
What?

19:27.354 --> 19:29.708
I said, "No. You won't miss me."

19:29.744 --> 19:31.844
Well, of course I'm gonna
miss you. How can you say that?

19:32.168 --> 19:33.935
And I won't miss you, either.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.216
'Cause I'm comin' with ya.

19:37.251 --> 19:39.212
- Ah, come on, Pamela.
- No.

19:39.237 --> 19:41.253
Glenn. I'm not gonna
let either one of us

19:41.289 --> 19:43.255
be alone anymore.

19:43.867 --> 19:46.492
I'm not gonna be able to
talk you out of this, am I?

19:46.711 --> 19:49.995
Well... no, you won't.

19:50.031 --> 19:52.064
Well, then I'm not even
gonna take the time to try.

19:52.099 --> 19:54.566
- Please don't.
- I got better things to do.

19:55.289 --> 19:57.055
- It'll take up too much time.
- (LAUGHS)

19:57.872 --> 19:59.705
That was a fun exchange.

20:00.218 --> 20:01.073
Carol.

20:01.108 --> 20:02.908
I got you a little something.

20:02.943 --> 20:04.328
It's Latisse.

20:04.353 --> 20:06.378
Just a few dabs in the
morning and Tandy's brows

20:06.414 --> 20:07.846
will be back in no time.

20:08.186 --> 20:09.352
It's a little sweaty.

20:10.551 --> 20:12.053
Thank you.

20:14.014 --> 20:15.313
PAMELA: Well,

20:15.967 --> 20:17.623
I didn't deserve your forgiveness,

20:17.658 --> 20:19.303
but you gave it to me anyway.

20:19.678 --> 20:22.761
I hope you know how
much that changed me.

20:23.156 --> 20:24.722
Todd, my bags?

20:25.484 --> 20:26.784
Yeah, sure.

20:27.050 --> 20:28.067
PAMELA: Well,

20:28.102 --> 20:29.535
off to die. (LAUGHS)

20:29.570 --> 20:31.870
I hope it's worth it.
Those kids better be alive.

20:31.906 --> 20:33.706
They probably won't be; they'll be dead.

20:33.741 --> 20:36.475
But it's good to go in
with low expectations.

20:37.306 --> 20:39.611
- That's why I love this woman.
- (PAMELA CHUCKLES)

20:39.647 --> 20:41.213
(ENGINE STARTS)

20:47.528 --> 20:50.556
PAMELA: Bye. Jeremy says bye!

20:53.174 --> 20:57.877
It truly was a
