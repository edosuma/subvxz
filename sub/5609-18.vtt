NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.497
RUBY: Come with me.

00:04.588 --> 00:05.703
Searching for werewolves?

00:05.797 --> 00:08.254
Helping someone else
find their path will help you with yours.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.173
You will see me again!

00:12.513 --> 00:14.549
Enjoy 02, witch.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.846
REGINA: What happened between
you and Hades?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.514
ZELENA: He fell in love with me.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.179
Nice shot.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.516
MARY: Red?

00:34.493 --> 00:35.608
MARY: Is she okay?

00:35.702 --> 00:36.908
DAVID: Why is she down here?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.531
-She's not...
-No, she's still breathing.

00:38.622 --> 00:39.737
Well, how long do you
think she'll be out?

00:39.831 --> 00:42.664
I don't know.
We hit her with some strong stuff.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.911
Where's she been
since she left Storybrooke?

00:44.002 --> 00:45.412
I don't know. She went to find her pack.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.836
Unless they're dead,
I'd say she's sniffing in the wrong place.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.459
Any explanation for
what she's doing here?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.882
Just this.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.643
RUBY: Over here! This way!

01:03.564 --> 01:04.770
Right behind you.

01:06.692 --> 01:07.807
(SNIFFING)

01:09.653 --> 01:10.813
(PANTS) What is it?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.360
I lost the scent again.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.525
Ruby, it's okay. We'll find your pack.

01:14.616 --> 01:18.325
That's what you said yesterday
and the day before.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.948
(SIGHS) lt's late. Come on.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.875
MULAN: Tell me everything you know
about this land.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.874
RUBY: There's supposed to be
a lot of singing.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.455
MULAN: Singing?

01:31.550 --> 01:33.381
Well, there was in the movie.
I saw it in Storybrooke.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.543
Ruby, this isn't a book or a movie.

01:37.306 --> 01:40.548
Well, whatever it is,
there's no trace of my pack's scent.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.382
I don't think they were ever here
to begin with.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.219
Well, we better start looking for
a way back to the enchanted forest.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.520
(SNIFFS) Wait.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.768
(SOFT GROWLING)

01:55.782 --> 01:57.158
(WHIMPERING)

01:58.160 --> 02:00.025
It's okay. (CHUCKLES)

02:00.120 --> 02:02.862
I think I know who this little guy is.
Toto?

02:02.956 --> 02:05.117
DOROTHY: I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.916
Toto only barks for one reason.

02:08.003 --> 02:11.916
When he has sniffed out a witch.
Who is it? Who's the witch?

02:12.007 --> 02:14.840
Uh, he's not barking
because I'm a witch. lt's...

02:15.510 --> 02:17.592
-Ruby, it's okay. You can tell her.
-(WH|MPER|NG)

02:19.598 --> 02:22.385
l'm... I'm part wolf.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.594
But there's nothing to be scared of.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.019
-See?
-DOROTHY: Wait.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.267
-Don't! Toto!
-(BARK|NG)

02:30.359 --> 02:32.145
Why did you do that? Toto!

02:32.235 --> 02:33.270
Well, let us help you.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.023
You've done enough.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.614
You're going the wrong way.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.154
Now you're an expert on 02?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.072
No.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.572
But I can tell you... (SNIFFS)

02:42.663 --> 02:44.745
...he's headed northwest.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.449
Straight into the wind, through
a juniper field into a valley of pines.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.411
Come on.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.171
No!

02:59.262 --> 03:01.048
RUBY: What is it?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.471
It's the Wicked Witch. Let's go!

03:16.446 --> 03:19.062
Would you prefer
I send you chocolates next time?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.237
If you're looking a thank you,

03:20.325 --> 03:22.737
maybe you should write your name
on the card next time.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.912
Well, I'm afraid I didn't come
to woo you, Zelena.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.455
I came to warn you.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.704
About what?

03:32.212 --> 03:35.170
You have a visitor from 02.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.090
What? Who?

03:38.176 --> 03:40.792
Let's just say
a werewolf crash-landed here.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.879
Feisty. Looks good in red.

03:43.974 --> 03:48.593
Oh, no. Oh, that's impossible.
Not after what I did to her.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.178
It must have been quite... (CHUCKLES)
Well, wicked

03:51.273 --> 03:53.480
for her to chase you
all the way down here.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.764
(SIGHS)

03:55.444 --> 03:57.981
Wicked doesn't begin to describe it.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.732
Whatever goodwill
I've earned with my sister

03:59.823 --> 04:02.030
will evaporate the minute
she learns the truth

04:02.117 --> 04:03.653
of what I did to their friend.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.067
(SIGHS)

04:05.162 --> 04:06.572
I need to leave before they find me.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.911
The UndenNorld?
Easier said than done.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.536
Need I remind you? I'm very much alive.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.207
l have my own way home.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.128
And your daughter?
You're just gonna leave her down here?

04:16.214 --> 04:19.923
No, she's why I'm leaving.
If I stay, if I face that wolf,

04:20.010 --> 04:22.672
I'm just going to do
something else that I'll regret.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.345
And then Regina
will never let me see her again.

04:25.432 --> 04:29.175
You certainly won't get
your daughter back by running. Hmm?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.850
Stay. Face them.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.601
(SCOFFS)

04:35.692 --> 04:37.557
Let me guess. With you?

04:37.652 --> 04:38.937
We make quite a team.

04:39.029 --> 04:44.194
You can trust me, Zelena.
I'll give you everything you want.

04:45.368 --> 04:49.987
(SIGHS) Sorry, Hades.
My time in the UndenNorld is over.

04:54.002 --> 04:54.991
(SIGHS)

04:56.129 --> 04:58.120
Do what you must.

04:58.215 --> 05:03.300
Butjust know, either way,
I'm going to take care of that wolf.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.843
(GASPING)

05:23.240 --> 05:24.400
(DOOR CLOSES)

05:24.491 --> 05:27.403
Stop torturing yourself, Belle.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.827
No, l... I gave Gaston
this book to teach him

05:30.914 --> 05:35.408
that a true hero needs to show
his enemy compassion, right?

05:35.502 --> 05:38.744
But in the moment that I could have
shown him mercy,

05:38.880 --> 05:41.257
well, I sent him to a fate
worse than death.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.502
Belle, you were trying
to protect our child.

05:43.593 --> 05:47.211
Yeah, and, and, you know, if Hades
had actually destroyed the contract,

05:47.264 --> 05:50.756
then maybe I could live with what I did.

05:50.851 --> 05:55.515
But he found a loophole
and l darkened my soul, Rumple, just...

05:55.605 --> 05:56.685
Just to save you.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.732
And now we can free our child
from Hades' grasp together.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.110
No, l, uh...
I need to make this right on my own.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.937
I leave it up to you,

06:06.074 --> 06:07.939
you'll just make me do
something else l'll regret.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.737
The UndenNorld?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.074
I don't understand.
I used a tracking spell

06:17.127 --> 06:18.617
so the cyclone
would bring me to Zelena.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.880
Ruby. She's down here too.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.420
Wait, love. You came down here
looking for Zelena?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.251
REGINA: (SIGHS)
Why am | not surprised?

06:24.301 --> 06:26.087
Uh, what did my sister do now?

06:26.136 --> 06:27.592
It's my friend, Dorothy.

06:27.637 --> 06:32.051
Zelena wanted her magic slippers
so that she could get back to her baby.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.973
Ruby, what did Zelena
do to your friend?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.603
That's why I'm here. I don't know.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.604
Dorothy went to face her
and just disappeared.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.812
Mulan and I looked everywhere,
but we couldn't find her.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.768
(SIGHS) Snow, this is all my fault.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.982
None of this would have happened
if! hadn't shown up in Oz.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.652
It's just one more life that
I've destroyed because of what I am.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.825
That is not true and you know it.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.786
Ruby, we'll find out
what happened to Dorothy. I promise.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.822
EMMA: There's only one way
we're going to do that.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.494
It's time to talk to Zelena.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.992
I'm coming.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.246
I actually thought
we were getting somewhere with her.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.502
David, will you do something
while I'm gone?

07:06.593 --> 07:07.673
Sure, what is it?

07:07.761 --> 07:10.753
Well, we haven't... Well,
Neal hasn't heard our voices in days.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.348
-And I'm getting a little...
-Yeah. Me too.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.512
I'll call him for both of us.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.473
Thank you. Oh, take Hook with you.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.304
The streets aren't safe for anyone
to be alone right now.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.810
Yeah. (CHUCKLES) I'll be careful.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.518
Believe me, I will tell Neal the reason
why his mother is not on the line.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.939
Because she's out doing
what she does best.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.644
Being a hero.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.324
HOOK: Careful, lad.
Hades has eyes and ears everywhere.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.705
We can't trust anyone here.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.039
HENRY: Is the line always this long?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.499
DAVID: That's not a line.
Something's wrong.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.956
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

07:44.047 --> 07:45.662
What does it look like, darling?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.706
I'm fulfilling my mayoral responsibilities

07:47.801 --> 07:49.837

some municipal improvements.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.259
Get on with it, Claude. Rip it out!

07:51.346 --> 07:52.802
No, no, no, no!

07:52.889 --> 07:55.676
This is the only chance these people
have to contact their loved ones.

07:55.767 --> 08:00.682
Oh, you mean it's your only opportunity
to reach out and haunt your infant son?

08:00.772 --> 08:03.309
Looks like Chisel Chin, Jr.,
will just have to go to bed

08:03.400 --> 08:06.563
without what I can imagine are
terribly dull bedtime stories.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.018
Cruella, why are you doing this?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.944
Is this because
I won't write you back to life?

08:10.365 --> 08:12.230
No, Henry, darling.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.488
I'm not the one that ordered all
the phones to be ripped out down here.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.152
Hades.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.158
Well, with all you heroes
running around the place,

08:19.290 --> 08:21.576
he feels there's a little too much
hope bubbling up in his realm.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.283
Well, you can tell him
it's going to take a lot more

08:23.378 --> 08:25.209
than ripping out phones
to discourage us.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.627
IWill.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.461
But in the meantime,

08:30.552 --> 08:33.510
if you wanted to strike a deal,
I could look the other way

08:33.596 --> 08:35.427
while you made one last call.

08:35.515 --> 08:40.851
I mean, assuming I'd have the Author
and his pen to write me back to life.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.473
We're not making deals with you.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.097
(CRUELLA GRUNTS)

08:46.651 --> 08:48.516

But for now,

09:07.547 --> 09:10.038
you're with the people
that can give you what you need.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.551
You're not going anywhere, sis.

(SIGHS) How do you expect me
to become mother material

09:18.600 --> 09:19.840
if you won't leave me be?

09:19.934 --> 09:22.220
We were planning on it,

09:22.312 --> 09:26.396
until someone you screwed over
literally dropped out of the sky.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.270
What did you do to Dorothy?

in Oz anymore.

You think I want to be
in this emerald-tinted dump?

09:52.884 --> 09:55.466
I was banished here. By your friends.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.168
I'm sure they had good reason.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.298
Of course.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.880
To keep me from my newborn baby.

Right.

It's the truth.

You see, Dorothy,
you may have the love of Oz,

but I have something better.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.941
No.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.443
I'm afraid I can't fix this.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.115
Even I can't help Dorothy now.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.237
Why not?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.073
(SIGHS)

11:11.171 --> 11:12.251
You killed her?

11:13.339 --> 11:14.954
Not quite.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.835
I took a page out of your book, Regina.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.422
Sleeping curse.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.592
You need to wake her up.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.966
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I can't.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.639
Dorothy may have the love
of the people of Oz,

11:25.727 --> 11:28.594
but there's only one thing
that can help her now.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.019
True Iove's kiss.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.472
No family, unmarried, unloved.
All alone.

11:33.484 --> 11:37.227
There's no one that can give Dorothy
what she needs.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.814
I'm afraid, sometimes I'm just too clever.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.288
It's a simple trade, really.
The slippers for my daughter.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.291
Really? You think
you're in a position to bargain?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.122
With your own child?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.755
You trapped Dorothy
in an unbreakable curse.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.676
I'm sorry if I'm good at what I do.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.427
Stop hiding behind all that bluster.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.677
You're not proud, you're caught.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.262
Look, I get it.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.767
You did a terrible thing.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.975
Butjust because
you made one bad move,

12:17.862 --> 12:18.942
or 30,

12:19.030 --> 12:22.318
doesn't mean you
can't make a good one now.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.366
Zelena.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.783
You can come back from this.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.160
Trust me, I know.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.417
(SCOFFS)

12:35.505 --> 12:36.540
You think so?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.667
Well, there's only one way to find out.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.424
If you try.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.844
(SIGHS)

12:50.728 --> 12:54.846
Here. You can keep your pep talks.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.478
I have no delusions
that anything will change.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.315
Not you, and not me.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.818
I hope they wake her.

13:03.908 --> 13:07.196
And if you need me, I'll be right here.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.455
We have to do something.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.829
Dorothy is all alone back there.
She doesn't have anyone.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.501
Not for long.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.171
These can at least get you back to Oz.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.966
How did you get her
to hand those over to you?

13:24.053 --> 13:26.044
You're not going to believe me,
but all I did was ask.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.676
What good are slippers
if there's no one back in Oz

13:28.766 --> 13:29.972
that can give Dorothy true Iove's kiss?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.801
Are you sure there isn't anyone?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.977
(STUTTERS)
Her family was awful to her.

13:35.189 --> 13:39.057
And the only person that she's ever
loved was her deceased Aunt Em.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.315
She may still be here.
All we have to do is find her.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.408
MULAN: This is the best shot we've got
to get Toto back.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.075
Are you sure it'll work on her?

13:51.414 --> 13:53.826
(SIGHS) Sleeping powder knocked
Zelena out before, it should again.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.248
Ijust need one more ingredient
to give it its kick.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.416
Poppies.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.618
I know exactly where we can get some.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.669
I'm coming with you.
Mulan, keep the cauldron going.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.872
I can handle myself.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.877
I wasn't asking permission.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.855
Either you're still mad at me
or you don't like to talk.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.105
You really want me to answer that?

14:24.155 --> 14:27.238
Toto's more than a pet, isn't he?

14:27.325 --> 14:28.906
You're right.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.324
I don't like to talk.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.787
Shouldn't I know
what we're fighting for?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.037
Fine. You want to know?

14:39.504 --> 14:42.792
The first time I visited Oz
I was just a kid.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.168
I wasn't here long,
but when I went back to Kansas,

14:45.259 --> 14:46.965
I told my family what happened.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.293
What? They didn't believe you?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.924
They tried to have me committed.

14:52.475 --> 14:53.590
I'm sorry.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.844
Don't be.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.055
It showed me who my real family was.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.762
Aunt Em. She believed me.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.393
She kept me from getting locked up.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.725
Is she still back in Kansas?

15:04.987 --> 15:06.443
She died not long after that.

15:06.531 --> 15:09.273
Butjust before she did,
she gave me Toto.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.658
He's all you have left of her.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.781
He's the only one who understands me.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.663
Don't worry.
We're going to get him back.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.046
You know, I understand what it's like
to feel like you don't belong anywhere.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.669
Really, Wolfie?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.670
Your family try to have you committed?

15:28.761 --> 15:31.798
No, my entire village ran me out of town.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.675
Really?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.427
With torches and pitchforks.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.269
Because you're a wolf?

15:39.147 --> 15:42.310
I didn't always know I was,
and I certainly didn't back then.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.810
I wasn't in control.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.771
And one night, I accidentally

15:48.364 --> 15:49.695
killed my boyfriend.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.733
-Wow.
-Yeah.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.574
I lived on the run after that

15:58.916 --> 16:02.124
and I eventually learned
to control my power.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.327
Made some friends along the way.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.664
Ended up in a town called Storybrooke.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.500
But I still felt like
there was something missing.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.881
And you came to Oz
looking for answers?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.257
I came here looking for my pack.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.135
I thought maybe they were
what was missing.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.345
But after searching for so long,

16:25.067 --> 16:27.274
I'm not sure
if they're the answer anymore.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.148
What are you looking for?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.700
I'm not sure.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.455
Well, maybe that's the problem.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.870
Come on, the field's up ahead.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.509
RUBY: That's her. That's Auntie Em.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.383
Well, it's not cracked or tipped.
She's still down here.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.759
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's find her.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.465
Well, it's not that simple.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.099
to give Dorothy true Iove's kiss.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.272
Maybe she doesn't have to.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.600
Uh, the other day the Blind Witch
bottled David's breath.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.685
What? Why would she do that?

17:10.780 --> 17:12.566
Yeah, well, she roasted children
in her previous life.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.772
Do we even want the answer to that?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.276
The point is,

17:15.368 --> 17:17.984
maybe we could do the same thing
with a kiss from Aunt Em.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.195
Ruby could use the slippers
to deliver it to Dorothy in Oz.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.788
DAVID: Snow!

17:23.292 --> 17:24.623
We've been looking everywhere for you.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.746
What is it? Did you talk to Neal?

17:26.837 --> 17:29.795
Hades ripped out the phone.
He's cut us off from Storybrooke.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.213
What? Why?

17:31.300 --> 17:32.335
Snow, Neal's fine.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.677
Wait, no. We don't know that.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.835
I mean,
maybe Hades did this for a reason.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.545
Maybe he's gonna make a move
on Storybrooke

17:37.640 --> 17:38.755
now that we're trapped down here.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.431
This is exactly what he wants.
For us all to lose hope.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.510
Well, it's hard not to
when our child's life might be in danger.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.435
Mom, I think it's time.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.808
For what?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.764
For you to go home. Both of you.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.484
We haven't completed our mission.
We haven't defeated Hades.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.732
EMMA: You've done more for me
than you know.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.188
And so many down here.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.820
And I meant what I said,
we came because we wanted to.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.116
Because I needed you.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.203
Now your other kid needs you more.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.370
And Storybrooke might too.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.492
Well, what about Hades?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.495
We don't even know how to begin
to fight him yet.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.295
Well, we'll just have to find a way
to wage our war without the Charmings.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.247
But this is the UndenNorld.
We can'tjust walk out.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.718
You can with the slippers.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.543
Go to Oz with Ruby.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.254
Once you help Dorothy, you can click
your way back to Storybrooke.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.806
Mom. Dad.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.178
You've done enough.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.267
Go take care of the rest of our family.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.265
I'm going to be okay.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.642
REGINA: You all are
forgetting something.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.605
Hades carved Snow's name
on a tombstone.

18:36.699 --> 18:40.738
Emma, you couldn't take it off.
Even with the slippers, she can't leave.

18:41.996 --> 18:45.238
I can't, but you can.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.584
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

18:52.757 --> 18:55.999
Belle. To what do I owe the honor?

18:56.093 --> 18:58.550
You're here to tear my crying baby
from my arms again?

18:58.638 --> 18:59.969
I need your help.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.129
-(SCOFFS)
-Please.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.306
I'm asking you as a mother.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.269
And what makes you think
Hades would listen to me?

19:08.356 --> 19:09.971
I know that he's in love with you.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.390
(CHUCKLES)

19:12.735 --> 19:16.148
My sister's got an even bigger mouth
than I thought.

19:16.238 --> 19:20.322
Sorry, but Hades would never rip up
one of his precious contracts.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.111
Even if I asked.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.744
Please, Zelena, you know
what it's like to have to lose a child.

19:28.376 --> 19:32.710
Why come to me when you've got
the Dark One on your side?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.709
Yeah. I can't really trust him right now.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.837
So you finally see the beast
behind the man?

19:38.928 --> 19:39.917
(CHUCKLES)

19:40.012 --> 19:44.096
Maybe you can understand why I'm not
rushing to Hades with open arms.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.888
But I don't think
it's because of me and Rumple.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.889
I think it's because you're scared.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.971
Of the Lord of Death? (CHUCKLES)

19:53.651 --> 19:56.768
Please. I just know the truth.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.604
I'm never going to get my happy ending.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.441
Not with Hades. Not with my daughter.
Not with anyone.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.321
Well, how do you know that
if you haven't tried?

20:04.412 --> 20:07.154
Oh, I have tried. (CHUCKLES)

20:07.248 --> 20:11.617
Look at where I am.
Drinking with the bookworm.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.620
(GAGS)

20:15.673 --> 20:18.915
Oh, come on, if! disgust you that much,
maybe you should leave.

20:20.010 --> 20:24.094
No. No, it's, uh...
It's, it's not that. I, uh...

20:24.682 --> 20:25.671
(SNIFFLES)

20:26.183 --> 20:30.517
It's just morning sickness. You, uh...
You remember what that's like.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.014
Actually, I don't.

20:32.106 --> 20:35.815
Not since the Dark Swan made sure
my pregnancy lasted all of 10 minutes.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.899
Wait.

20:37.987 --> 20:41.229
Wait, wait, wait. Hades, if he...
If he decides he wants my child now,

20:41.323 --> 20:43.655
he could speed up my pregnancy too.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.825
I'd love to say that
he isn't capable of such a thing,

20:45.911 --> 20:47.697
but I can assure you he is.

20:47.788 --> 20:51.326
No. And I, I thought that
I had time on my side.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.867
Guess I don't.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.914
(SIGHS)

20:57.339 --> 20:59.295
That's not necessarily true.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.917
There may be a way.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.845
(SIGHS)

21:19.069 --> 21:20.445
Anything?

21:20.529 --> 21:24.898
Just that Auntie Em died in Kansas.
No details. Not a clue.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.737
I can't believe it has to be me.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.744
Snow should be home.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.417
She should be with our boy.
She should be going.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.962
She missed this time with Emma.
And now it's happening all over again.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.209
We shouldn't be here.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.298
-I didn't...
-No, no, no. You're right.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.175
You shouldn't be here.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.633
And I realize that I haven't said it yet,

21:52.770 --> 21:54.556
but thank you.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.055
I didn't want Emma to do this,
let alone drag everyone along.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.651
Hey, we made our own choices.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.475
Really? I didn't know you care.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.152
-I did it for Emma.
-Ah, I figured.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.904
And I guess you've grown on me a bit.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.735
-Hmm?
-(CHUCKLES)

22:10.830 --> 22:12.411
Well, I tend to have
that effect on people.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.329
All right, don't push it.

22:14.416 --> 22:18.534
Look, your name's not
on the headstone, mate.

22:18.629 --> 22:19.664
You can go.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.413
Ruby's your ticket out of here.
You have to take it.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.123
(SIGHS)

22:24.760 --> 22:26.921
I wish it didn't have to be like this.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.008
But you're right.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.722
I just hope we can help Ruby.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.180
DOROTHY: The poppy field.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.642
This is Zelena's territory.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.317
We need to be careful.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.024
-|'m sorry.
-Wait. For what?

22:51.120 --> 22:53.076
-Calling you Wolfie.
-(CHUCKLES)

22:53.163 --> 22:54.903
-If I had known...
-No!

22:55.040 --> 22:57.827
-It's okay. I actually kind of like it.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

22:59.253 --> 23:03.246
But I do think it's only fair that
I get to give you a nickname, too.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.381
-Really?
-Really.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.796
(CHUCKLES)

23:10.472 --> 23:11.803
How about "Kansas"?

23:12.141 --> 23:13.347
(CHUCKLES)

23:13.434 --> 23:15.425
All right, Wolfie.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.392
Kansas it is.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.846
Careful.

23:24.028 --> 23:26.235
One sniff of that
and we'll be snoozing all night.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.988
Thanks.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.453
(SCREECHING)

23:38.500 --> 23:40.240
Zelena! She found us.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.792
There's more on the way.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.340
We'll never outrun them.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.665
-Well, sure, we can.
-How?

23:47.718 --> 23:48.707
Do you trust me?

23:48.928 --> 23:49.917
Uh...

23:53.849 --> 23:55.180
Yes.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.561
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

24:08.697 --> 24:09.777
(GASPING)

24:11.742 --> 24:12.857
Oh!

24:22.836 --> 24:24.042
(SCREECHING)

24:42.398 --> 24:43.763
(HOWLING)

24:49.530 --> 24:50.861
What happened?

24:50.948 --> 24:52.063
DOROTHY: Zelena.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.531
We were almost monkey chow.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.233
(SIGHS)

25:04.461 --> 25:06.292
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

25:11.760 --> 25:13.421
Are you okay?

25:18.642 --> 25:20.178
Dorothy?

25:20.310 --> 25:23.097
Yeah, I'm just tired.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.562
Maybe it was all the poppies.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.106
I'm going to get some shut-eye.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.111
(SNIFFING)

25:44.043 --> 25:46.455
Sorry. No dogs allowed.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.998
No one talks to me like that in my diner.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.546
It's not yours, dear. Not yet.

25:51.633 --> 25:55.091
There's a tombstone in the cemetery.
Emily Brown.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.465
Why don't you make this easy
and tell us where to find her?

25:58.474 --> 26:00.430
What do I get out of it?

26:00.517 --> 26:01.927
The wolf keeps her cloak on.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.519
Unless you want to start
putting your customers on the menu.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.686
Fine.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.313
-I know her.
-Yeah?

26:09.401 --> 26:12.985
Yeah. I hate that Auntie Em.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.609
-Why's that?
-She's the competition.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.659
AUNTIE EM: Welcome to Auntie's.
The pot pie's my own family recipe.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.579
But we do a good roasted chicken, too.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.371
Rotisserie. Any way you want.

26:25.459 --> 26:26.869
But the soup...

26:26.960 --> 26:31.499
Well, the soup is to die for.
Unless you're already dead.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.421
Then it's, uh...
Well, you know what I mean.

26:33.509 --> 26:36.421
We're trying to help Dorothy.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.127
You know my Dorothy?

26:38.222 --> 26:39.507
Yes.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.509
She's not down here, is she?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.431
No. She's alive,

26:43.519 --> 26:45.055
but she needs your help.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.430
She needs true Iove's kiss.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.103
All you need to do
is blow a kiss into the bottle.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.101
Maybe helping Dorothy
is your unfinished business.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.398
Maybe that's why you're down here.

26:54.863 --> 26:55.852
(GASPS)

26:56.907 --> 26:58.363
AUNTIE EM: What, What...

26:58.450 --> 26:59.530
What's happening?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.483
MARY: Emma, what did you do?
RUBY: Somebody help her!

27:01.578 --> 27:03.114
-Emma...
-EMMA: I didn't do anything.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.661
AUNTIE EM: NO!

27:04.748 --> 27:06.363
-No!
-RUBY: Somebody do something.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.535
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

27:10.587 --> 27:12.123
What the hell was that?

27:12.214 --> 27:14.375
I don't think the soup agreed with her.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.086
You did this?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.553
Mmm. Guilty. (CHUCKLES)

27:19.471 --> 27:21.177
A little water from the River of Souls

27:21.265 --> 27:24.052
gives the soup
a little something special.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.259
Why would you hurt her?
She was just a sweet old lady.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.435
Hmm. Isn't it obvious?

27:28.522 --> 27:30.012
Because you're trying to help her.

27:30.107 --> 27:34.692
And Dorothy, who happens to be
Zelena's sworn enemy.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.518
Did she put you up to this?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.990
Trust me, she has no idea I'm here.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.905
But this is about so much more than
just your sister.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.826
Let's call it a teachable moment.

27:43.912 --> 27:47.200
You wouldn't be here unless you were
scared we might actually win this fight.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.290
(LAUGHS) Yes.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.702
Is that so, Savior?

27:55.382 --> 28:00.001
Because I don't think
Dorothy's dear old aunt...

28:01.805 --> 28:03.887
(CHUCKLES) ...would agree with you.

28:10.564 --> 28:15.775
from now on,
this is what happens to anyone

28:15.861 --> 28:19.149
who deals with these so-called heroes.

28:19.239 --> 28:22.823
So, who's next in line for their help?

28:24.328 --> 28:25.443
Oh.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.484
Hmm?

28:27.748 --> 28:31.866
It's hard to be a savior when no one
wants you to save them.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.590
I gave the vial of powder to Dorothy.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.134
-We attack at first light.
-Good.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.513
"Good"? That doesn't sound like
a very convincing battle cry.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.686
Ruby, what's going on?

28:57.819 --> 29:00.151
When we were on our trek, uh...

29:00.239 --> 29:04.152
Dorothy asked me what I've been
looking for this whole time.

29:04.243 --> 29:08.737
And I... (INHALES DEEPLY)
Told her that I didn't know.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.081
Well, do you?

29:10.832 --> 29:11.992
(SIGHS)

29:14.211 --> 29:15.917
I think...

29:18.298 --> 29:23.588
I think that I've been looking for
someone like her.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.507
And I...

29:26.556 --> 29:32.301
I know we just met, but I've never felt
like this about anyone before.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.223
(CHUCKLES) That's great.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.937
So what's wrong?

29:42.906 --> 29:45.238
You saw how she looked at me
when I transformed.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.741
She could barely bring herself
to say anything.

29:50.080 --> 29:54.790
Maybe she was feeling
exactly what you were.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.534
Maybe she didn't know
how to put it into words.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.463
Maybe she was just freaked out.
Maybe it was all too much for her.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.585
Ruby.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.885
Don't make the same mistake I did.

30:06.972 --> 30:10.009
Don't wait until it's too late
to tell someone how you feel.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.300
(SIGHS)

30:14.771 --> 30:16.227
You really think I should?

30:43.050 --> 30:45.757
Oh, there you are.
Hey, it's not safe here.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.924
What are we going to do now, Snow?

30:47.012 --> 30:48.798
What we always do,
find a way to fix things.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.800
But no one can wake Dorothy up now.

30:51.224 --> 30:53.931
Well, I mean,
I don't think that's entirely true.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.010
Well, who else can give her
true Iove's kiss?

31:00.525 --> 31:02.311
I don't know. I don't know.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.648
Maybe, mmm...

31:05.739 --> 31:06.854
You?

31:06.948 --> 31:07.983
What?

31:10.118 --> 31:12.655
Ruby, you're my best friend. I know you.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.407
And I see how worried you are.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.832
You can tell me.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.712
You're right.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.792
So why are you standing here?
Why aren't you on the way to Oz?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.126
True love is a two-way street.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.088
And Dorothy,
I don't think feels the same.

31:32.182 --> 31:33.297
Why? What makes you think that?

31:33.392 --> 31:35.883
She kinda bailed on me back in Oz.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.557
-(SNIFFLES)
-So? Love's... Iove's a funny thing.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.606
When I met Charming,
I hit him in the face.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.812
People in love
hurt each other all the time.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.318
Yeah. (STUTTERS) Maybe. Um...

31:52.411 --> 31:54.902
But, uh, it's just...

31:55.914 --> 31:57.029
(SIGHS)

31:58.208 --> 32:00.870
I've never been so scared
about anything before.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.872
That's a great sign.

32:02.963 --> 32:06.000
'Cause love is freaking scary.

32:06.091 --> 32:10.334
I'm about to say goodbye to David
for what might be a really,

32:10.387 --> 32:12.469
really long time.

32:12.556 --> 32:13.671
And you know why I'm okay with it?

32:14.266 --> 32:18.054
Because what you get back
when you love someone

32:18.186 --> 32:20.643
far outweighs the risk.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.596
(SIGHS)

32:25.485 --> 32:27.521
All right. |'||, I'll try.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.898
(CHUCKLES)

32:33.660 --> 32:35.366
(RUBY SIGHS)

32:35.454 --> 32:37.194
Ready.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.197
Put these on.

32:40.292 --> 32:44.205
Think of where you want to go,
then click your heels three times.

32:44.296 --> 32:48.960
David, you should take her hand
and hold tight.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.961
So I guess this is goodbye.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.213
(CHUCKLES)

32:53.680 --> 32:55.887
We've done this before.
We can do it again.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.716
When you get home,
tell Neal I'll be there as fast as I can.

32:58.810 --> 33:03.850
Well, I was actually hoping that
you could tell him that for me.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.352
David, you know I can't leave.

33:06.443 --> 33:07.649
Now you can.

33:08.445 --> 33:09.525
What?

33:09.613 --> 33:11.979
I removed your name
from the headstone.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.609
REGINA: Am I missing something?

33:13.700 --> 33:14.940
Emma already tried that.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.117
Yeah, and it didn't work.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.160
Because you tried to erase the names.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.493
The rule down here is simple.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.666
Life for life.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.453
So I traded mine for yours.

33:30.091 --> 33:33.709
If one of us gets to go home
and see our son, it should be you.

33:33.803 --> 33:35.543
How did you even do this?

33:35.639 --> 33:37.379
Simple, love.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.510
Hades overlooked one thing
during my escape.

33:39.601 --> 33:42.468
He enchanted my hand
to carve these markers in the first place.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.939
I can't erase the names,

33:45.023 --> 33:46.979
but I can change them.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.605
-Come on, our boy waits for you.
-Um...

33:51.696 --> 33:52.811
I was ready for you to go.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.112
No, it's better this way.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.030
You can look after him.
And if Storybrooke is in trouble,

33:56.117 --> 33:57.948
there's no better leader
than Snow White.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.110
(INHALES DEEPLY)

34:00.205 --> 34:02.036
-You sure?
-Go to our son.

34:02.832 --> 34:03.992
Go home.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.701
I'll be back before you know it.

34:09.506 --> 34:11.963
Mom, I'm not very good at goodbyes.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.756
MARY: No!

34:13.843 --> 34:15.674
It runs in the family.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.346
Snow, while you're up there,

34:19.432 --> 34:21.809
will you look in on Roland
for Robin Hood?

34:21.893 --> 34:23.508
I know he'd want me to ask you that.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.140
Of course. Tell him not to worry.

34:27.691 --> 34:28.931
(SIGHS)

34:44.624 --> 34:45.704
Ready?

34:46.543 --> 34:48.079
Let's go find Dorothy.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.494
(SNIFFING) Ah.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.872
ZELENA: Hello, Hades.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.750
Zelena.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.458
You're the last person
I expected to show up here.

35:34.549 --> 35:37.006
A little chat with a bookworm
made me realize

35:39.471 --> 35:41.382
maybe I haven't given you a fair chance.

35:42.349 --> 35:46.683
Well, you're just in time to see this.
Auntie Em.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.266
Freshly bottled today.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.144
All that trouble
to punish one moldy old aunt?

35:53.234 --> 35:55.725
With the old lady gone,
Dorothy has no one.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.562
And I know how much you hate that girl.

36:03.953 --> 36:07.491
ZELENA: She came to my chamber.
She tried to make me take a nap.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.410
So I did something much worse.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.539
(LAUGHS)

36:16.091 --> 36:19.458
Dorothy's gonna be asleep forever.
What do you get out of it?

36:30.772 --> 36:33.263
Other than your happiness,

36:35.068 --> 36:36.774
mmm, nothing.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.776
Really?

36:40.031 --> 36:41.066
(CHUCKLES)

36:41.116 --> 36:43.152
This was all for me?

36:43.284 --> 36:46.117
I know this is hard for you to believe.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.663
But it's why I did it.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.371
To show you it's possible to be selfless.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.710
You're scared
I'm going to disappoint you, aren't you?

36:56.381 --> 36:57.587
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

36:58.633 --> 36:59.839
Terrified.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.291
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

37:02.721 --> 37:05.554
But I think that's a chance
I'm just going to have to take.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.011
Let's start

37:10.687 --> 37:14.805
by toasting
to Dorothy's eternal slumber.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.481
(GLASSES CLINK)

37:30.290 --> 37:31.746
(BARKING)

37:32.000 --> 37:33.831
What is it, Toto?

37:40.842 --> 37:42.833
Ruby! Snow!

37:43.511 --> 37:45.047
Wait, you found her?

37:45.180 --> 37:47.546
I've been waiting for you to get back.
She's under...

37:47.682 --> 37:49.183
A sleeping curse. I know.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.761
Thank you for taking care of her.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.013
I've had some experience
with this sort of thing.

37:59.402 --> 38:02.735
Ruby, you can do this.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.729
-Go.
-Okay. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:07.494 --> 38:08.483
(SIGHS)

38:20.882 --> 38:21.871
(EXHALES)

38:46.908 --> 38:48.364
(GASPS)

38:52.455 --> 38:54.571
-Wolfie?
-Kansas.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.114
(BARKING)

38:58.795 --> 38:59.830
Well...

39:01.214 --> 39:02.203
Well...

39:04.926 --> 39:06.757
You left without saying anything.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.136
I was afraid.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.141
I couldn't lose you to Zelena.

39:18.565 --> 39:19.930
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

39:20.024 --> 39:22.140
Well, yeah, but I almost lost you.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.603
You didn't.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.613
You came back for me.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.366
I always will.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.310
(SIGHS)

40:16.873 --> 40:19.205
After what Hades did,
we have to hit back, and hard.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.666
Aye, love, but how?

40:21.753 --> 40:22.993
Grandpa.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.870
I thought you'd like to see the latest.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.167
Grandma made it back to Storybrooke.

40:31.346 --> 40:36.261
(SIGHS) Thanks, kid.
Now let's go figure out how to join them.

40:36.392 --> 40:37.677
What is it?

40:37.727 --> 40:39.217
Snow, she made it.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.228
(DOOR CHIMES)

40:52.909 --> 40:54.069
Belle, where have you been?

40:54.202 --> 40:55.692
Trying to find a way to fix your mistake.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.027
So have I.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.032
I'm doing research.
This is going to take some time.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.448
Which is exactly what we don't have.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.033
Hades can take our baby
whenever he wants to.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.623
Just like Emma did to Zelena.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.544
Well, I won't let that happen.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.377
Well, I can't take the chance
that you'll stop him in time.

41:10.426 --> 41:15.045
Not when there's a way I can pause
everything, even my pregnancy.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.551
Where did you get that?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.386
From Zelena, but don't worry.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.812
A sleeping curse. It'll halt everything.

41:21.896 --> 41:25.309
Ah! I can prick my finger
quicker than you can stop me.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.600
As long as I'm asleep,
Hades can't take the baby.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.728
And you'll have all the time you need
to destroy the contract.

41:31.781 --> 41:33.146
Belle, you're only going
to make things worse.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.903
I'm doing what I need to,
to protect our child.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.817
There's only one way
out of a sleeping curse.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.948
-True Iove's kiss.
-I know.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.948
You think this is gonna force me to
become the man you want me to be?

41:43.084 --> 41:46.121
To go back to the light,
just to wake you up?

41:46.254 --> 41:48.245
My love, I already told you.
I'm not that man.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.083
No, I know.

41:50.174 --> 41:53.337
You're not the one
who's going to wake me, Rumple.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.463
My father is.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.176
Oh, no, Belle, please don't do this.

41:56.264 --> 41:58.755
After you destroy the contract,

41:59.767 --> 42:03.009
you do whatever it takes
to get me back to him.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.263
No. (GRUNTS)

42:07.150 --> 42:08.310
Oh, Belle.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.603
(GRUNHNG)

42:11.946 --> 42:14.983
Oh, no. No! Belle, no!

42:17.452 --> 42:18.658
