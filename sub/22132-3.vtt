WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:04.250
yeah

01:21.810 --> 01:25.710
everyone gather around somebody here I
want you to me

01:30.319 --> 01:33.978
dawn masterton hello everyone

01:34.670 --> 01:38.210
jon is going to be joining our team she
comes from the university of florida

01:38.209 --> 01:40.519
where she's a specialist in the human
body

01:40.519 --> 01:44.780
physiology kinesiology she's gonna make
a stronger faster and better

01:45.799 --> 01:49.219
we're gonna do some hypoxic training
some of you are probably familiar with

01:49.219 --> 01:53.569
the concept basically with repetition
hypoxic training teaches the body to

01:53.569 --> 01:58.069
function effectively using less and less
oxygen under water especially in big

01:58.069 --> 02:01.639
wave conditions there are August
advantages when your body can better

02:01.640 --> 02:04.519
utilize the limited oxygen supply in
your lungs

02:04.519 --> 02:08.959
it gives you more time underwater lives
can depend on those additional seconds

02:08.959 --> 02:13.009
a perfect example is when i'm at rest
under water I can hold my breath for

02:13.009 --> 02:15.019
three minutes and 22 seconds

02:15.020 --> 02:20.209
now if I swim as fast as I can that same
supply of oxygen when last minute 30

02:20.209 --> 02:20.900
seconds

02:20.900 --> 02:25.219
so the critical choice i must make is
how fast do I swim

02:25.219 --> 02:29.930
how long do I choose to make my oxygen
supply lasts in order to save the

02:29.930 --> 02:35.030
drowning victim or stay under the wave
and get to the victim choice

02:36.469 --> 02:39.469
it's all about choice

02:40.479 --> 02:43.268
so we're going to do a drill called
whole town's 30 seconds is the amount of

02:43.269 --> 02:48.129
time you have for each lap choice you
can swim a length as fast as you can for

02:48.128 --> 02:48.908
10 seconds

02:48.908 --> 02:52.359
come up and catch your breath for 20
seconds and start the next lab or swim

02:52.360 --> 02:57.010
for 15 Mary 4 15 or swim for 20 and
breathe for ten the more laps you do

02:57.009 --> 03:00.878
fatigue becomes a factor in choice more
critical all right scope

03:04.750 --> 03:07.659
you two done man

03:07.659 --> 03:11.409
you're on the team you participate in
the drill or thanks for the speech and

03:11.409 --> 03:14.409
the next wine air flight leaves in 20
minutes

03:17.699 --> 03:20.649
ok under water till the end

03:20.650 --> 03:24.489
and come up account for about as long as
it would take the next wave hit

03:24.489 --> 03:30.009
we'll do it again how many laps 10 and
more than the test requires white zone

03:30.009 --> 03:32.768
is for immediate loading and I'm okay

03:32.769 --> 03:36.069
I don't you start over here let's go

03:44.599 --> 03:57.829

14:00.149 --> 14:06.269
I'm involved with someone you still
haven't been able to separate emotion

14:06.269 --> 14:09.629
from what's otherwise purely physical

14:10.200 --> 14:13.200
probably just as well

14:14.580 --> 14:18.420
&lt;operand> two &lt;/operand> no one on Team
a watch can know about us I got the

were given an orientation right right

15:01.208 --> 15:05.498
that's right you told him what was
expected set up some ground rules

15:05.499 --> 15:09.428

one thing I don't have time for his

15:09.428 --> 15:10.509
excuses

15:10.509 --> 15:14.558
i went from the airport to the swimming
pool after a 14-hour flight from Sri

15:14.558 --> 15:18.249
Lanka before which I had taken serious
quantities of a native antihistamine

15:18.249 --> 15:21.249
after being bitten by a green like a
spider

15:21.249 --> 15:24.879
