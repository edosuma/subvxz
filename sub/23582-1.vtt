00:01.738 --> 00:03.005
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

00:03.526 --> 00:04.807
Ava, honey?

00:07.679 --> 00:08.945
Yeah, I... I think we've been robbed.

00:08.947 --> 00:10.947
Um...

00:13.318 --> 00:14.617
<i>Hi, Ez.</i>

00:14.619 --> 00:16.919
- <i>You must be very confused.</i>
- _

00:16.921 --> 00:19.689
<i>You will never see me again.</i>

00:19.691 --> 00:20.957
There's a problem with your wife.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.758
- May I come in?
- Who are you?

00:22.760 --> 00:24.427
I am her husband, just like you.

00:24.429 --> 00:26.362
We married the same woman,
and she took us both!

00:26.364 --> 00:27.830
Do you know this woman?

00:27.832 --> 00:28.831
She's my wife.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.166
No way.

00:30.168 --> 00:31.367
<i>She's out there,</i>

00:31.369 --> 00:32.567
<i>probably working some new guy,</i>

00:32.570 --> 00:33.903
<i>looking like some new chick.</i>

00:33.905 --> 00:35.271
Saturday, I'm having a barbecue.

00:35.273 --> 00:37.373
<i>Is she getting distracted?</i>

00:37.375 --> 00:39.475
<i>Maybe I need to send Lenny Cohen.</i>

00:39.477 --> 00:41.010
Hello, Maddie.

00:41.012 --> 00:42.178
I'm Lenny Cohen.

00:42.180 --> 00:45.114
Tell me about Patrick Campbell.

00:45.116 --> 00:46.349
Patrick's in the FBI.

00:46.351 --> 00:48.017
What is that supposed to mean?

00:48.019 --> 00:49.952
<i>I followed him to the
goddamn headquarters</i>

00:49.954 --> 00:52.855
<i>and it said Federal goddamn
Bureau of Investigation.</i>

00:52.857 --> 00:54.991
We are all in the exact same boat.

00:54.993 --> 00:57.460
<i>I have a plan.</i>

00:57.462 --> 00:58.728
<i>We take Patrick,</i>

00:58.730 --> 01:00.263
<i>we pay off the Doctor,</i>

01:00.265 --> 01:02.298
and the FBI doesn't
even know what happened.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.733
Would you please tell me

01:03.735 --> 01:06.469
where that ridiculously expensive ring

01:06.471 --> 01:07.603
<i>that you gave that woman is?</i>

01:07.605 --> 01:08.704
<i>I realized that Maddie</i>

01:08.706 --> 01:10.006
<i>was gonna take the ring</i>

01:10.008 --> 01:13.142
<i>and burn us all.</i>

01:13.144 --> 01:16.379
<i>Oh, my God. You fooled them all.</i>

01:16.381 --> 01:18.481
Always forward.

01:18.483 --> 01:20.483
Never back.

01:20.485 --> 01:22.018
<i>You need to find Max and Maddie</i>

01:22.020 --> 01:23.319
<i>before the Feds do.</i>

01:23.321 --> 01:24.820
Oh, yes, I will.

01:24.822 --> 01:26.489
<i>And those three impostors, too.</i>

01:26.491 --> 01:27.757
<i>Right away.</i>

01:46.273 --> 01:47.009
Guys!

01:47.011 --> 01:48.978
- Wait, where are you going?
- What?

01:48.980 --> 01:50.179
We got to go to the ticket office, man.

01:50.181 --> 01:51.314
I got to take a piss real quick.

01:51.316 --> 01:52.415
No, no, we don't have time.

01:53.141 --> 01:53.716
Whoa!

01:53.718 --> 01:55.685
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry, sorry.

02:46.471 --> 02:50.139
So, where are we going?

02:50.141 --> 02:52.608
Well, I guess we should find
someplace we can sell the ring, right?

02:52.610 --> 02:54.744
Shh!

02:54.746 --> 02:57.246
That rhymes with "fillion bollar king."

02:57.248 --> 02:59.081
We should definitely sell it, fast.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.649
But not, like, at a normal...

03:00.651 --> 03:03.185
selling place, because the FB...

03:03.187 --> 03:05.588
the burrow will be tracking it for sure.

03:05.590 --> 03:07.123
They probably think Maddie
or the Doctor has it.

03:07.125 --> 03:08.791
Oh, duh.

03:08.793 --> 03:09.925
Duh, what?

03:09.927 --> 03:11.727
Bro, I can totally sell

03:11.729 --> 03:13.529
the fillion bollar king in Scottsdale.

03:13.531 --> 03:15.531
- I know a guy.
- What guy?

03:15.533 --> 03:17.433
The right guy, and his boss.

03:17.435 --> 03:18.868
They're, uh, professionals,

03:18.870 --> 03:20.536
and they love doing business with me.

03:20.538 --> 03:21.971
- Uh, yeah, that's not...
- Yeah, dude, this does not

03:21.973 --> 03:23.539
- inspire me.
- Guys, guys.

03:23.541 --> 03:25.508
I don't say "I got this"
unless I got this.

03:25.510 --> 03:27.410
Now let's go buy some
freaking bus tickets.

03:27.412 --> 03:29.211
Let's get a "Scottsdale" on three.

03:29.213 --> 03:33.215
One, two, three, Scottsdale!

03:33.217 --> 03:36.185
I'll work on that.

03:36.187 --> 03:39.155
<i>Bus 202 is now boarding...</i>

03:41.459 --> 03:43.526
All right. Come on.

03:43.528 --> 03:46.796
What? No, Martha, you know who I am.

03:46.798 --> 03:47.797
Look, Martha...

03:47.799 --> 03:49.298
Martha, Martha... okay.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.200
I know, I know, but I'm...
No, it's true!

03:51.202 --> 03:52.635
I would... Mar, listen,

03:52.637 --> 03:54.637
I would never in a million years.

03:54.639 --> 03:56.639
Oh, sorry, sorry.

03:56.641 --> 03:58.974
Eyes up there, Petunia.

03:58.976 --> 04:00.242
I like your boots.

04:00.244 --> 04:02.044
Heh. What?

04:02.046 --> 04:03.379
No, I wasn't talking to you.

04:03.381 --> 04:05.147
I know your name's not Petunia.

04:05.149 --> 04:07.016
All right, I got 35 bucks.

04:07.906 --> 04:10.152
I keep telling you,
refined sugar is expensive,

04:10.154 --> 04:11.353
and it's bad for you.

04:11.355 --> 04:13.989
I have... 25 bucks.

04:13.991 --> 04:15.524
Yeah, well,
I guess four pounds of almonds

04:15.526 --> 04:16.926
are expensive too.

04:16.928 --> 04:18.027
They must have been organic.

04:18.029 --> 04:21.063
You guys.

04:21.065 --> 04:22.231
What about the code?

04:22.233 --> 04:24.600
"Thou shalt scam only assholes."

04:24.602 --> 04:27.369
The guy called me Petunia.

04:27.371 --> 04:28.471
Definitely an asshole.

04:28.473 --> 04:29.572
Thank you.

04:31.175 --> 04:32.575
<i>Tell me about yourself.</i>

04:32.577 --> 04:34.143
<i>Well, my name is Molly,</i>

04:34.145 --> 04:35.945
<i>and I'm looking for a fresh start.</i>

04:36.755 --> 04:37.546
<i>Let me guess.</i>

04:37.548 --> 04:40.983
You're fleeing a tragic romance,
aren't you?

04:40.985 --> 04:42.585
Just out of a marriage.

04:42.587 --> 04:45.287
Not exactly sure how tragic.

04:45.289 --> 04:47.356
I like quiet tenants.

04:47.358 --> 04:48.958
No... drama.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.960
Never been one for drama.

04:50.962 --> 04:53.262
<i>I'm just looking for a nice, quiet life</i>

04:53.264 --> 04:54.964
<i>in a nice, quiet town</i>

04:54.966 --> 04:56.098
<i>where nobody knows me</i>

04:56.100 --> 04:57.967
<i>and I don't know anybody.</i>

05:03.174 --> 05:05.841
<i>You know, some real stability,</i>

05:05.843 --> 05:08.277
<i>a clean slate,</i>

05:08.279 --> 05:09.612
<i>same as everyone else.</i>

05:09.614 --> 05:12.882
<i>A happy, normal life.</i>

05:12.884 --> 05:15.084
Great. Thanks.

05:15.086 --> 05:16.619
There are your keys.

05:16.621 --> 05:18.787
Thanks.

05:25.563 --> 05:28.264
<i>Maddie Jonson.</i>

05:28.266 --> 05:29.865
Who are you now?

05:43.314 --> 05:45.948
Simons!

05:45.950 --> 05:48.651
How many times I have to tell you?

05:48.653 --> 05:51.220
This office is for agents
who didn't screw the pooch.

05:51.222 --> 05:53.122
Yeah, well, it doesn't look
like you're having any luck

05:53.124 --> 05:55.024
finding the Doctor or Maddie.

05:55.026 --> 05:56.792
What are you guys doing?

05:56.794 --> 05:59.328
You still looking for that ring, bud?

05:59.330 --> 06:00.696
Check behind the couch cushions.

06:00.698 --> 06:02.364
That's where my wife
is always losing shit.

06:03.367 --> 06:04.500
Thanks, Mangrove.

06:04.502 --> 06:06.468
You're a inspiration.

06:08.372 --> 06:09.638
Okay, for you new guys,

06:09.640 --> 06:11.574
our key to finding the Doctor

06:11.576 --> 06:14.510
is Saffron Keyes, AKA Maddie Jonson.

06:14.512 --> 06:17.446
Stole a $1.4 million diamond ring,

06:17.448 --> 06:19.582
aided and abetted by one Ezra Bloom...

06:31.195 --> 06:32.461
That's the guy?

06:32.463 --> 06:34.296
Oh, come on, don't make fun.

06:34.298 --> 06:36.365
Luke's had a bit of a bad streak,

06:36.367 --> 06:37.967
but he's doing the best he can.

06:37.969 --> 06:40.169
You said "professionals."

06:40.171 --> 06:41.971
He was my backup QB.

06:41.973 --> 06:43.539
We went through some
serious shit together

06:43.541 --> 06:44.640
in high school.

06:44.642 --> 06:47.042
Yo, Fluke!

06:47.044 --> 06:48.711
Evans! Yeah!

06:48.713 --> 06:51.313
Yeah, dancing queen!
Get in here, brother!

06:51.315 --> 06:52.948
- My man!
- Whoo!

06:54.006 --> 06:54.783
Good to see you, man.

06:54.785 --> 06:56.185
Dude!

06:56.187 --> 06:57.519
Oh, you got small.

06:57.521 --> 06:58.621
Oh, come on! I'm keeping it tight.

06:58.623 --> 06:59.622
The ladies aren't complaining.

06:59.624 --> 07:01.090
Yeah, yeah.

07:01.092 --> 07:02.091
I guess you're back on the market, huh,

07:02.093 --> 07:03.292
after all the, uh...

07:04.293 --> 07:05.094
ugly shit.

07:05.096 --> 07:06.695
Yeah.

07:06.697 --> 07:07.763
You know,
I never liked that little bitch.

07:07.765 --> 07:08.897
Don't call her that.

07:08.899 --> 07:10.199
Hey, don't call her that.

07:12.637 --> 07:15.371
Mrs. G wasn't expecting a nerd party.

07:15.373 --> 07:16.739
Yeah, I know. They're...

07:16.741 --> 07:18.507
They're uptight, but they're okay, man.

07:18.509 --> 07:20.342
They're, uh, my council-lawyeries.

07:20.344 --> 07:21.677
Consiglieri.

07:21.679 --> 07:22.678
Huh?

07:22.680 --> 07:23.912
We're his lawyers.

07:23.914 --> 07:25.247
Yeah, we'll be speaking

07:25.249 --> 07:26.982
for Mr. Evans' interests in this matter.

07:26.984 --> 07:29.518
Oh. Lawyer, huh?

07:29.520 --> 07:31.420
You got a card or something?

07:31.422 --> 07:33.856
Do you?

07:33.858 --> 07:35.557
They in this with you?

07:35.559 --> 07:37.693
Yeah, man, yeah. It's all good.

07:37.695 --> 07:39.028
All right.

07:39.030 --> 07:41.530
Come on back, but fair warning...

07:41.532 --> 07:45.567
we don't serve no
avocado toast back here.

07:45.569 --> 07:47.670
Ooh!

07:47.672 --> 07:48.904
Come on, man, don't do that.

07:48.906 --> 07:50.139
- What the?
- What?

07:50.141 --> 07:51.674
Just follow my lead on this, okay?

07:51.676 --> 07:54.076
My town, my people, my lead.

07:58.949 --> 08:01.150
Mrs. G!

08:01.152 --> 08:03.052
Good to see you again, Mrs. G.

08:05.089 --> 08:07.156
Let me know when it's done.

08:10.461 --> 08:12.761
What are you looking at?

08:12.763 --> 08:15.030
Come here.

08:15.032 --> 08:16.899
Good to see you again.

08:16.901 --> 08:18.467
I'm supposed to know you?

08:18.469 --> 08:20.469
Richard Evans, ma'am.

08:20.471 --> 08:22.504
These are my counsel... uh,

08:22.506 --> 08:23.839
my representation.

08:23.841 --> 08:25.374
These two.

08:25.376 --> 08:27.376
He helped you out with a little, uh,

08:27.378 --> 08:29.178
football game situation, Mrs. G.

08:29.180 --> 08:30.612
About ten years ago.

08:30.614 --> 08:32.414
You made out pretty good, if I remember.

08:32.416 --> 08:33.816
It was a three-point spread...

08:33.818 --> 08:36.085
Yap, yap, yap.

08:37.822 --> 08:39.755
Yeah.

08:39.756 --> 08:41.423
Thanks, man.

08:41.424 --> 08:43.491
Also, I was the number one
car dealer in Scottsdale,

08:43.494 --> 08:44.493
three years running.

08:44.495 --> 08:46.628
Yeah, I remember.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.197
You're the one that got
taken to the cleaners

08:48.199 --> 08:49.998
by that little blond filly.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.968
Uptown girl.

08:52.970 --> 08:54.203
You live and you learn.

08:54.205 --> 08:56.205
Hmm.

08:56.207 --> 08:58.741
So, what kind of business
we doing today?

08:58.743 --> 09:01.143
Well, Mrs. G,
she didn't take everything.

09:01.820 --> 09:02.678
Thank you.

09:08.252 --> 09:10.352
Yeah, how about that?

09:10.354 --> 09:13.555
Pull up a chair, son. I won't bite.

09:23.567 --> 09:26.034
I'll give you 300 grand for it.

09:26.036 --> 09:28.837
With all due respect, Mrs. G,
it's worth at least a mil.

09:28.839 --> 09:31.106
Now, I'll take 750, and that's a steal.

09:31.108 --> 09:34.009
There are costs to moving
something this big,

09:34.011 --> 09:36.245
and, I'm assuming, this hot.

09:36.247 --> 09:38.981
I won't make anything if I
give you anything over...

09:38.983 --> 09:40.349
five.

09:40.351 --> 09:44.253
500 grand for a $1 million ring?

09:44.255 --> 09:46.021
Mrs. G, I...

09:47.558 --> 09:49.191
Deal.

09:49.193 --> 09:50.859
I'll need a day to raise the cash.

09:50.861 --> 09:52.428
We'll be in touch.

09:52.430 --> 09:54.396
King of Scottsdale, baby!

09:54.398 --> 09:56.565
- I'm back, huh?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.233
All right,
but those guys are sketchy, Richard.

09:58.235 --> 09:59.568
I-I don't know about them.

09:59.570 --> 10:01.136
How about "Thank you, Richie?"

10:01.138 --> 10:02.571
- I'm just saying...
- "You rock, Richie!"

10:02.573 --> 10:04.139
- How about that?
- Okay, you rock, Richie.

10:04.141 --> 10:05.174
Okay, okay.

10:05.176 --> 10:08.076
So... so what's there to do
in Scottsdale while we wait?

10:08.078 --> 10:11.180
Same thing I did for 24 years.

10:11.182 --> 10:14.016
Hang out at my mom's house.

10:19.267 --> 10:20.666
All right, my friends,

10:20.668 --> 10:23.736
welcome to Casa Chez Evans.

10:23.738 --> 10:25.805
Wow, you're a landowner, Richard.

10:25.807 --> 10:27.707
Eh, not so much.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.776
Mom had to take out
a bunch of mortgages.

10:29.778 --> 10:31.811
Turns out getting sick is expensive.

10:31.813 --> 10:33.546
And did your mom keep a liquor cabinet?

10:33.548 --> 10:36.282
Yeah, go for it.

10:36.284 --> 10:38.351
- You, uh, getting nostalgic?
- Totally.

10:38.353 --> 10:40.553
This hallway,
Easter weekend, senior year,

10:40.555 --> 10:42.822
I banged both Dixon
sisters on the floor.

10:42.824 --> 10:44.123
Okay, dude.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.726
Eh, wasn't that cool.
It was, like, an hour apart.

10:46.728 --> 10:48.761
Oh, my God.

10:48.763 --> 10:49.829
Whoa!

10:49.831 --> 10:51.297
- No way!
- Baby-face!

10:51.299 --> 10:52.665
- Dude, that's you?
- Oh, my God.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.767
No way, dude. You got ugly!

10:54.769 --> 10:55.802
- So sweet.
- Shut up.

10:55.804 --> 10:57.336
Jesus, what is that?

10:57.338 --> 10:59.172
Well, uh, that's from the dealership.

10:59.174 --> 11:01.307
I was the number one
dealer in Scottsdale...

11:01.309 --> 11:02.475
- Three years running.
- Three years running?

11:02.477 --> 11:04.243
- We know.
- Yeah.

11:04.245 --> 11:06.045
Well, your mom was obviously
pretty proud of you, man.

11:06.047 --> 11:07.947
Damn right.

11:07.949 --> 11:09.482
You need a drink?

11:09.484 --> 11:10.783
Yeah, it's slim pickings around here.

11:10.785 --> 11:12.718
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.554
After, uh, Alice left,

11:14.556 --> 11:16.122
this place was just chilling empty,

11:16.124 --> 11:17.323
so I moved back in.

11:17.325 --> 11:18.791
Dark days.

11:18.793 --> 11:21.494
Is... is that from your pottery phase?

11:21.496 --> 11:22.862
Family heirloom.

11:22.864 --> 11:24.730
Mom used to keep flowers in it.

11:24.732 --> 11:27.400
I used it for something else.

11:27.402 --> 11:30.169
Richard, I may actually love you.

11:30.171 --> 11:32.271
Oh, now you sound like Megan Dixon...

11:32.273 --> 11:33.673
or was it Bridgette?

11:33.675 --> 11:35.775
- Ugh.
- Psych! It was both.

11:35.777 --> 11:37.743
Yeah, maybe we should try
and stay sharp for tomorrow.

11:37.745 --> 11:39.345
Oh, loosen up, Ez.

11:39.347 --> 11:41.013
If you're tight before a big game,
you choke, right?

11:41.015 --> 11:42.682
You don't want to choke, do you?

11:42.684 --> 11:44.283
No, I...

11:44.285 --> 11:45.785
Come on, you want to get stoned.

11:45.787 --> 11:46.786
I'm just trying to...

12:01.402 --> 12:02.735
Come on!

12:02.737 --> 12:04.136
Right here!

12:04.138 --> 12:05.471
Straight ahead?

12:05.473 --> 12:06.939
Uh-huh.

12:06.941 --> 12:09.208
Yeah.

12:10.678 --> 12:12.378
Markings?

12:29.664 --> 12:32.231
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:36.938 --> 12:38.404
- Yeah, just keep an eye out...
- Claire?

12:38.406 --> 12:40.840
- Oh!
- How are you?

12:44.212 --> 12:46.412
I'm so sorry.

12:46.414 --> 12:47.513
It's okay.

12:47.515 --> 12:49.882
Are you looking for yourself
or a gift for someone else?

12:49.884 --> 12:51.617
Oh, uh, just me, yeah.

12:51.619 --> 12:53.052
Cool, cool.

12:53.054 --> 12:55.521
So, uh, which one is you?

12:55.523 --> 12:57.189
- Hmm?
- They say there's a wind chime

12:57.191 --> 12:58.691
that's right for every person.

12:58.693 --> 13:00.593
You know,
if you believe in that sort of thing.

13:00.595 --> 13:01.894
Oh.

13:01.896 --> 13:03.562
Yeah, I don't really know

13:03.564 --> 13:05.431
what I'm... what I believe in.

13:05.433 --> 13:07.700
Well, we make them ourselves

13:07.702 --> 13:10.202
at the, uh, Harbor.

13:10.204 --> 13:11.704
Ooh.

13:11.706 --> 13:13.940
Who knew there was so
much money in wind chimes?

13:14.695 --> 13:16.375
No, it's just one of the workshops.

13:16.377 --> 13:19.445
"Whimsy of your inner wind chimes,"

13:19.447 --> 13:21.781
which is a dorky name,
but a great class.

13:21.783 --> 13:23.249
Oh, yeah, I get it.

13:23.251 --> 13:27.286
One of those New Age
places for rich yuppies.

13:27.288 --> 13:28.754
Ouch.

13:28.756 --> 13:31.123
We call it a holistic wellness center.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.892
- I'm sorry. I...
- No, I... kidding.

13:32.894 --> 13:34.927
It kind of tests well
with the rich yuppies.

13:34.929 --> 13:36.796
Yeah, I bet.

13:40.068 --> 13:41.567
What?

13:44.739 --> 13:47.406
I made this one myself. Copper.

13:47.408 --> 13:49.008
Strengthens the <i>manipura</i> chakra

13:49.010 --> 13:51.243
for confidence and
control of your destiny.

13:51.245 --> 13:52.545
I... uh, it's really nice,
but I'm not...

13:52.547 --> 13:54.113
You know what? Here. No, it just...

13:54.115 --> 13:56.615
Think of it as a pretty gift,

13:56.617 --> 14:01.253
from one well-meaning person to another.

14:01.255 --> 14:02.254
Thank you.

14:02.256 --> 14:04.623
You're quite welcome.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.292
Thanks.

14:27.682 --> 14:28.681
Hey!

14:53.674 --> 14:55.808
I mean, take the three of us.

14:58.646 --> 15:01.347
We've known each other a few months,

15:01.349 --> 15:03.849
but also, like, forever.

15:03.851 --> 15:06.285
Our cells knew each
other since the Big Bang.

15:06.287 --> 15:08.020
I hate that show.

15:08.022 --> 15:09.488
It's like, we...
we think we live our lives

15:09.490 --> 15:12.158
in this straight line,

15:12.160 --> 15:15.027
but in truth, time actually moves

15:15.029 --> 15:16.862
totally in both directions.

15:16.864 --> 15:17.897
Yeah...

15:17.899 --> 15:20.633
Both directions, right?

15:20.989 --> 15:22.334
- Yeah.
- Yes!

15:22.336 --> 15:24.003
Or listen to this:

15:24.005 --> 15:26.972
I get a '67 Shelby GT500,

15:26.974 --> 15:29.075
use that to make commercials
for the dealership

15:29.077 --> 15:30.876
and then seriously raise my Q rating.

15:30.878 --> 15:32.378
One, two, three...

15:32.380 --> 15:33.546
Are you guys even listening to me?

15:33.548 --> 15:35.114
Yeah!

15:35.116 --> 15:38.350
We're really about
to head off, into, like,

15:38.352 --> 15:39.919
new lives.

15:39.921 --> 15:42.121
An end.

15:42.123 --> 15:44.190
A beginning.

15:44.192 --> 15:46.258
But we're left with pieces
of each other, right?

15:46.260 --> 15:47.526
No.

15:47.528 --> 15:49.728
- No good-bye threesome.
- Ugh.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.363
- What?
- Why would you even go there?

15:51.365 --> 15:53.466
I thought you were...
I mean, that's a thing.

15:53.468 --> 15:55.101
A good-bye threesome is not a thing.

15:55.103 --> 15:56.602
It is absolutely a thing.

15:56.604 --> 15:58.771
Just because you've never had one
does not mean it's not a thing.

15:58.773 --> 16:00.906
I will not miss you.

16:06.781 --> 16:09.548
Oh, shit.

16:09.550 --> 16:11.050
Did someone narc us out?

16:11.052 --> 16:12.618
You think the FBI found us?

16:12.620 --> 16:14.753
- Oh...
- No.

16:21.796 --> 16:24.930
Do not panic.

16:24.932 --> 16:26.565
Go, go, go.

16:28.402 --> 16:29.735
- Holy shit!
- Air freshener

16:29.737 --> 16:30.903
- under the kitchen sink!
- Shit!

16:30.905 --> 16:32.271
Where did the bag go?

16:32.273 --> 16:33.939
- Sheriff's department!
- Oh, God.

16:33.941 --> 16:35.908
One moment, please!

16:35.910 --> 16:37.176
Sheriff's department!

16:37.178 --> 16:38.744
That's bug spray. That's bug spray!

16:38.746 --> 16:39.812
Open up!

16:39.814 --> 16:41.113
I know you're in there!

16:41.573 --> 16:42.314
One second!

16:44.418 --> 16:48.187
Hi, Sheriff, what seems to be the...

16:48.189 --> 16:50.322
Oh, my God.

16:50.324 --> 16:51.991
Oh, my God, Richie!

16:51.993 --> 16:53.526
Kim?

16:53.528 --> 16:56.162
I thought meth-heads had
broken in or something.

16:56.164 --> 16:57.463
You're a cop?

16:57.465 --> 16:58.731
Sheriff.

16:58.733 --> 17:00.065
Deputy, I mean.

17:00.067 --> 17:01.800
Awesome. Law enforcement, huh?

17:01.802 --> 17:03.269
Yeah, I still drive the old route

17:03.271 --> 17:05.404
just to check on the house.

17:05.406 --> 17:07.839
You never said good-bye.

17:07.842 --> 17:10.476
Yeah, I was a bit of a mess back when...

17:10.478 --> 17:12.211
Who are your friends?

17:12.213 --> 17:13.212
Um, oh, m...

17:13.214 --> 17:14.680
Uh, they're just...

17:16.217 --> 17:17.950
It's a need-to-know.

17:17.952 --> 17:19.295
Don't need to know.

17:22.656 --> 17:25.357
Richard Evans, are you stoned?

17:25.358 --> 17:28.827
A squidge.

17:28.829 --> 17:30.362
Awesome.

17:30.364 --> 17:32.298
My shift ends in seven minutes.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.449
Oh, I am so...

17:45.451 --> 17:47.018
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.586
- Hey.
- How you doing?

17:48.588 --> 17:50.454
- Good.
- Looking for a good book?

17:50.456 --> 17:52.556
Huh? Oh, yeah.

17:52.558 --> 17:55.126
No, I mean, it's a...
This... this is me now.

17:55.128 --> 17:57.028
- I, uh... I work here.
- Cool.

17:57.030 --> 17:58.596
Yeah, I was just on my way to lunch.

17:58.598 --> 18:01.098
Um, do you want any company?

18:01.100 --> 18:02.967
Uh...

18:02.969 --> 18:04.668
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.303
There's, like,
a great little salad-sandwich spot

18:06.305 --> 18:07.972
like, right down the street
around the corner.

18:07.974 --> 18:08.808
Okay.

18:08.842 --> 18:10.708
How long have you worked there?

18:10.710 --> 18:14.045
Uh, not long, you know.

18:14.047 --> 18:16.013
So how are you enjoying the wind chimes?

18:16.015 --> 18:18.482
Was I right or was I right?

18:18.484 --> 18:20.484
Hung them by the window near my bed.

18:20.486 --> 18:22.987
My mani... pyura

18:22.989 --> 18:25.489
never felt so refreshed.

18:25.491 --> 18:27.291
Oh, man.

18:27.293 --> 18:28.926
You totally didn't hang them, did you?

18:28.928 --> 18:31.395
Bang, straight in the closet.

18:31.397 --> 18:32.997
Sorry, it's not really my thing.

18:32.999 --> 18:34.231
No, I get it, you know.

18:34.233 --> 18:36.167
Maybe someday you'll bust them out,

18:36.169 --> 18:37.168
give it a go.

18:37.170 --> 18:39.703
Mm, never know.

18:39.705 --> 18:41.138
You know, not to press,

18:41.140 --> 18:42.373
but the place where I work,

18:42.375 --> 18:44.975
there are awesome workshops
on getting rid of...

18:44.977 --> 18:46.010
Oh, boy, here we go.

18:46.012 --> 18:48.045
No, really.

18:48.047 --> 18:51.215
I am the last guy who would
ever be into this shit,

18:51.217 --> 18:54.685
but letting go of fear and mistrust

18:54.687 --> 18:55.853
and cynicism...

18:55.855 --> 18:58.289
Excuse me, I am not cynical.

18:58.291 --> 19:01.025
I gave you a present and
you put it in the closet.

19:01.027 --> 19:02.960
Look, I don't know you, buddy boy.

19:02.962 --> 19:06.297
What if those wind chimes
had secret cameras on there

19:06.299 --> 19:08.165
and you're some kind
of wind chime pervert?

19:08.167 --> 19:10.401
I'm... not a wind chime pervert.

19:16.676 --> 19:19.743
I got to get better about
talking about the Harbor.

19:19.745 --> 19:22.246
You know,
it's made such a difference in my life

19:22.248 --> 19:24.748
and I just make it sound so stupid.

19:24.750 --> 19:25.983
It doesn't sound stupid.

19:25.985 --> 19:27.685
It sounds like a perfect scam,

19:27.687 --> 19:28.686
and a good one at that.

19:28.688 --> 19:29.753
It's not a scam.

19:29.755 --> 19:31.689
You make me take one workshop

19:31.691 --> 19:34.325
and then you introduce me to this

19:34.327 --> 19:37.261
perfect mirage of happiness,
just outside my reach,

19:37.263 --> 19:39.697
and all I have to do
to get to that mirage

19:39.699 --> 19:41.232
is pay for another workshop,

19:41.234 --> 19:43.067
and then maybe pay for another workshop

19:43.069 --> 19:45.436
and then perhaps take
the advanced class...

19:46.806 --> 19:50.608
Classic scam,
dressed up with fortune cookie wisdom.

19:50.610 --> 19:52.743
The fact that you're scared
of going to a deeper place...

19:52.745 --> 19:54.111
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I am not scared.

19:54.113 --> 19:57.281
...suggests that you definitely
need to go to that very place.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.216
Michael, what I need right now

19:59.218 --> 20:03.888
is a quiet, boring, normal...

20:07.960 --> 20:09.393
Hey, I think we should go.

20:09.395 --> 20:10.561
Are you all right?

20:10.563 --> 20:12.563
Yeah, I, uh, just remembered

20:12.565 --> 20:15.032
I have an errand I have to run

20:15.034 --> 20:17.701
before my break is over.

20:17.703 --> 20:19.770
This was great. See you around?

20:19.772 --> 20:21.272
Yeah.

20:38.090 --> 20:40.157
So, how'd you guys meet?

20:40.159 --> 20:42.426
Uh, I used to paint his number

20:42.428 --> 20:44.728
- on my face at every game.
- Oh.

20:44.730 --> 20:46.096
It's not like he ever noticed me.

20:46.098 --> 20:47.631
I noticed.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.767
And then, like kismet,

20:49.769 --> 20:51.635
during my security rounds one night,

20:51.637 --> 20:55.072
I found Richie at the
end of the driveway,

20:55.074 --> 20:56.440
drunk out of his gourd,

20:56.442 --> 20:58.342
tears and snot all over,

20:58.344 --> 21:00.544
crying like a bitch.

21:00.546 --> 21:02.179
Cute little bitch.

21:02.181 --> 21:04.348
Poor thing.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.225
Yeah.

21:05.818 --> 21:08.285
It was a bit of a rough patch for me.

21:08.287 --> 21:10.588
Ended up being a fun night, though, no?

21:10.590 --> 21:12.957
You were very comforting.

21:16.862 --> 21:19.463
And then, the next time I came over...

21:19.465 --> 21:23.133
I was off on a little adventure.

21:23.135 --> 21:25.569
Yeah.

21:25.571 --> 21:27.705
And now you're back.

21:27.707 --> 21:32.710
Yeah, I came to visit my mom in the...

21:32.712 --> 21:33.911
graveyard.

21:33.913 --> 21:36.013
Not, like, her, obviously,

21:36.015 --> 21:39.216
but, like, the... grave.

21:39.218 --> 21:40.517
I didn't mean to pry.

21:40.519 --> 21:43.153
Yeah, what are you, a cop?

21:49.128 --> 21:50.594
No, seriously, who are these two,

21:50.596 --> 21:52.496
your partners in crime?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.833
Uh-uh.

21:55.835 --> 21:58.669
I, um... serious, kind of.

21:58.671 --> 22:00.571
None of my business, unless it is.

22:00.573 --> 22:01.939
My Spidey-sense says...

22:01.941 --> 22:03.707
Yeah, um,

22:03.709 --> 22:05.643
so can we trust you, Kim?

22:05.645 --> 22:07.711
Like, total cone of silence?

22:12.251 --> 22:14.618
We're conducting

22:14.620 --> 22:16.820
an exploratory campaign to measure

22:16.822 --> 22:20.424
Richard's popularity in
the upcoming election

22:20.426 --> 22:21.959
as potential mayor of Scottsdale.

22:21.961 --> 22:25.696
He's polling quite well
in these early stages.

22:25.698 --> 22:28.699
That's amazing!

22:28.701 --> 22:31.568
You could totally be mayor here.

22:31.570 --> 22:32.603
Yeah?

22:32.605 --> 22:34.071
Heck, yeah!

22:34.073 --> 22:36.740
And I'd sign up to be
your first volunteer.

22:36.742 --> 22:38.542
Your best volunteer.

22:38.544 --> 22:40.844
I insist.

22:40.846 --> 22:43.213
Well, shit, Kimberly,

22:43.215 --> 22:45.082
then I volunteer you to hit me again.

22:45.084 --> 22:47.718
Ah, with pleasure.

22:57.196 --> 22:58.295
You want to, uh,

22:58.297 --> 22:59.997
go look at our old yearbooks?

22:59.999 --> 23:01.198
Uh-huh.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.867
Let's go.

23:06.305 --> 23:07.604
You have handcuffs?

23:07.606 --> 23:08.872
- Uh-huh. I do.
- Ooh.

23:08.874 --> 23:11.208
I know how to use them too.

23:11.210 --> 23:12.209
Good night, guys!

23:13.446 --> 23:15.346
Shall we take the air?

23:15.348 --> 23:16.613
With pleasure.

23:26.692 --> 23:28.425
I think that's a great idea, though...

23:29.829 --> 23:31.662
Stop by there on the way back too.

23:31.664 --> 23:35.165
Okay. Sounds good.

24:12.004 --> 24:13.637
<i>American goldfinch.</i>

24:15.641 --> 24:17.007
<i>Barn owl.</i>

24:19.011 --> 24:20.544
<i>Mourning dove.</i>

24:22.148 --> 24:23.881
<i>Bearded tit.</i>

24:25.484 --> 24:27.418
<i>Brewer's blackbird.</i>

24:29.655 --> 24:31.955
<i>Common loon.</i>

24:33.726 --> 24:35.192
<i>Double-crested cormorant.</i>

24:36.962 --> 24:39.096
Saffron. A saffron diamond.

24:40.533 --> 24:41.832
No, there's no certificate.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.867
It's hot. That's why I'm calling you.

24:43.869 --> 24:47.204
Uh-huh. Okay, great.

24:47.772 --> 24:50.174
- Where's my G and T?
- Coming right up.

24:50.176 --> 24:52.309
Chuck says a saffron diamond that size

24:52.311 --> 24:54.978
could be worth a million five.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.747
Makes you think.

24:56.749 --> 24:58.582
If we needed,

24:58.584 --> 25:00.184
can you handle Evans?

25:00.186 --> 25:01.652
I won't dignify that with an answer.

25:05.424 --> 25:06.890
You wanted to see me, Mrs. G?

25:06.892 --> 25:08.425
Tell your friend we're on for tomorrow,

25:08.427 --> 25:09.893
and I want you at the meet.

25:09.895 --> 25:12.596
Put him at ease.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.898
Everything cool?

25:14.900 --> 25:17.334
I'm cool, Fluke.

25:17.336 --> 25:18.602
Is your friend cool?

25:18.604 --> 25:20.137
Uh, I think so.

25:20.139 --> 25:21.705
Then I guess everything is cool.

25:26.812 --> 25:28.812
Cool.

25:30.716 --> 25:33.383
Shh.

25:33.385 --> 25:35.118
Thank God. I think they must be asleep.

25:36.388 --> 25:37.554
- Ah, they're not asleep.
- Shh!

25:37.556 --> 25:38.822
- Why?
- I don't know.

25:38.824 --> 25:40.557
I... just let them have their fun.

25:40.559 --> 25:42.392
I don't want them to be self-conscious.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.897
I, uh...

25:46.899 --> 25:49.500
I haven't had sex in so long.

25:50.936 --> 25:53.470
Like, so long.

25:53.472 --> 25:54.938
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:54.940 --> 25:56.607
I'm surprised.

25:56.609 --> 25:58.108
I mean, like,
don't get a big head or anything,

25:58.110 --> 26:00.143
but, like,
I think you're kind of a catch, man.

26:00.145 --> 26:01.512
Oh, my God, shut up.

26:01.514 --> 26:02.579
I wasn't fishing for compliments.

26:02.581 --> 26:04.581
I'm just saying.

26:04.583 --> 26:07.050
Also, like,
when exactly in the last six months

26:07.052 --> 26:09.253
would I have had time or
opportunity to get laid?

26:09.255 --> 26:10.454
I mean...

26:10.456 --> 26:12.489
Richard managed to get it done.

26:12.491 --> 26:13.490
More than once.

26:13.492 --> 26:14.791
Yeah, well,

26:14.793 --> 26:16.059
a leopard can't change his pants.

26:16.735 --> 26:18.328
True.

26:18.330 --> 26:20.631
Well, I also happened to get it done.

26:20.633 --> 26:21.732
Right.

26:21.734 --> 26:23.267
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, maybe...

26:23.269 --> 26:25.502
Maybe I should've just
seduced an FBI agent

26:25.504 --> 26:27.638
and, you know,
risked sending my friends to prison.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.140
Hey, hey, do what you got to do, baby.

26:32.611 --> 26:34.511
I'm such a loser.

26:36.949 --> 26:38.849
Hey.

26:38.851 --> 26:41.351
You are not a loser.

26:45.891 --> 26:48.025
You...

26:48.027 --> 26:50.527
are like a dreamer

26:50.529 --> 26:53.897
just waiting for someone to dream about.

26:53.899 --> 26:57.234
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:57.236 --> 27:00.203
Which, I guess,
is just another definition of a loser.

27:00.205 --> 27:02.205
- What is your problem?
- So rude!

27:02.207 --> 27:03.206
I'm feeling so vulnerable right now!

27:03.208 --> 27:04.575
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- Like...

27:04.577 --> 27:06.843
- Oh, that was terrible.
<i>- Shut up!</i>

27:06.845 --> 27:10.013
<i>We're doing some serious work in here!</i>

27:10.015 --> 27:11.481
Sorry!

27:17.656 --> 27:19.590
Rough day?

27:19.592 --> 27:21.858
Rough year.

27:21.860 --> 27:23.694
Whiskey, neat,

27:23.696 --> 27:26.463
and, uh, keep the bottle handy.

27:38.243 --> 27:40.877
I gave her up.

27:40.879 --> 27:42.179
Me.

27:42.181 --> 27:43.480
It's my bad,

27:43.482 --> 27:44.881
and I'll tell you something.

27:44.883 --> 27:47.217
We're garbage people.

27:48.854 --> 27:52.222
We're all garbage people.

27:52.224 --> 27:53.724
Hold up.

27:53.726 --> 27:55.292
Your card's been declined.

27:55.294 --> 27:56.693
Oh, really?

27:56.695 --> 27:58.495
It was working all day.

27:58.497 --> 27:59.496
Try it again.

27:59.498 --> 28:00.731
Why don't we try cash?

28:02.368 --> 28:03.700
Cash is king.

28:11.543 --> 28:12.976
Can you break $100?

28:21.520 --> 28:22.853
Oh, here,

28:22.855 --> 28:24.755
no, just keep this for yourself.

28:30.996 --> 28:32.396
Come on, man.

28:32.398 --> 28:34.331
What the hell?

28:34.333 --> 28:35.866
Oh, shit, that was sloppy.

28:35.868 --> 28:37.234
Uh...

28:39.538 --> 28:41.238
I'm gonna hit the ATM.

28:46.945 --> 28:48.345
Hey!

28:48.447 --> 28:49.479
Hey!

28:56.288 --> 28:58.121
Oh, man.

28:58.123 --> 29:00.323
This is a serious fire hazard.

29:02.399 --> 29:03.660
That's all you got?

29:06.131 --> 29:07.164
That's more like it.

29:28.717 --> 29:31.718
_

29:31.720 --> 29:33.572
_

29:37.826 --> 29:40.193
Hey.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.263
D'Angelo's for dinner, 8:00.

29:43.265 --> 29:45.699
The Gullivers could be great
supporters down the line.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.834
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

29:47.836 --> 29:49.870
I love you, baby.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.238
Good.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.839
Now go get 'em, panther.

30:26.708 --> 30:28.041
Uh, excuse me for one second.

30:30.579 --> 30:31.945
Hey, hey, hey.

30:31.947 --> 30:33.747
Just about to close on this chump.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.949
It kind of looks like you're
about to put him to sleep, man.

30:35.951 --> 30:37.550
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:37.552 --> 30:40.186
Wait a second.
No, let me have this one, man.

30:40.188 --> 30:41.788
I haven't scored a commission in weeks.

30:41.790 --> 30:43.290
Tell me about it.

30:43.292 --> 30:45.058
No, I think it's time
we had a real think

30:45.060 --> 30:48.895
about whether you're actually
Evans Motors material, huh?

30:48.897 --> 30:50.964
Oh, hey, boss.

30:50.966 --> 30:52.565
There seems to be a problem

30:52.567 --> 30:54.634
with the payroll checks
we issued Friday.

30:54.636 --> 30:55.635
What's the problem?

30:55.637 --> 30:56.937
They bounced.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.071
All of them.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.272
What?

30:59.274 --> 31:01.007
Come on!

31:01.009 --> 31:02.008
Come on.

31:02.010 --> 31:03.476
No, no, no, no, no.

31:03.478 --> 31:04.811
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:04.813 --> 31:05.812
What the (BLEEP)?

31:05.814 --> 31:07.013
What's going on?

31:08.917 --> 31:10.150
I have no idea...

31:14.990 --> 31:16.323
Call Alice.

31:16.325 --> 31:17.757
Call Alice!

31:18.612 --> 31:19.759
<i>We're sorry.</i>

31:19.761 --> 31:21.494
<i>You have reached a number
that has been disconnected...</i>

31:21.496 --> 31:23.263
- Hey, boss?
- What?

31:23.265 --> 31:25.665
I have no idea how
this could've happened,

31:25.667 --> 31:27.634
but apparently,
after we closed last night,

31:27.636 --> 31:30.370
we sold 30 cars for over $2 million,

31:30.372 --> 31:32.672
which I cannot find anywhere.

31:32.674 --> 31:33.840
That's not possible.

31:33.842 --> 31:35.909
Find them. Find them!

31:47.155 --> 31:48.655
<i>Hello, Richie.</i>

31:48.657 --> 31:51.358
<i>This must be quite a shock.</i>

31:52.861 --> 31:55.729
<i>All that money and credit cards,</i>

31:55.731 --> 31:57.297
<i>all those cars,</i>

31:57.299 --> 31:59.632
<i>all gone.</i>

31:59.634 --> 32:02.135
<i>There's really no easy way to say this,</i>

32:02.137 --> 32:03.803
<i>so here it is.</i>

32:03.805 --> 32:06.172
You will never see me again.

32:17.285 --> 32:19.552
Yo.

32:19.554 --> 32:21.021
You're late.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.356
Yeah, sorry,
I stopped by the dealership.

32:23.358 --> 32:26.326
Doing the full nostalgia tour.

32:26.328 --> 32:28.228
Feels like a lifetime ago.

32:28.230 --> 32:29.863
Really?

32:29.865 --> 32:32.298
I feel like I blinked
and ten years went by.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.507
Meet us with the ring in the alley

32:40.509 --> 32:42.042
behind the old hat factory.

32:45.447 --> 32:46.880
Cool?

32:46.882 --> 32:48.248
Cool.

32:50.352 --> 32:52.786
It was a dick thing I did.

32:52.788 --> 32:55.088
What was?

32:55.090 --> 32:57.524
All of it, man.

32:57.526 --> 32:59.559
Treating you like shit.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.095
Waving my awesome life in your face.

33:02.097 --> 33:04.864
I was stuck up my own ass,
and I'm sorry.

33:11.444 --> 33:13.073
Shit.

33:16.478 --> 33:19.779
Get the hell out of Scottsdale, Richie.

33:19.781 --> 33:21.381
- What?
- You can find a better deal

33:21.383 --> 33:23.616
somewhere else.

33:23.618 --> 33:25.018
I'm pretty happy with the 500 grand.

33:25.020 --> 33:27.220
You're not listening to me, man.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.955
Maybe Mrs. G will honor the deal.

33:28.957 --> 33:30.223
Maybe she'll kick you in the nuts.

33:30.225 --> 33:31.291
Do you know?

33:31.293 --> 33:33.026
'Cause I sure as hell don't.

33:33.028 --> 33:34.594
The universe...

33:34.596 --> 33:36.229
it's a freaking mystery.

33:36.231 --> 33:40.166
Are you aware of something
that I should be aware of?

33:40.168 --> 33:42.068
Protect your nuts.

33:42.070 --> 33:44.838
That's all.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.673
And you didn't hear it from me.

33:54.749 --> 33:55.815
Hey.

33:55.817 --> 33:58.318
Huh, nice of you
to join us today, Bullock.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.819
Rough night?

33:59.821 --> 34:01.754
Oh, pretty rough.

34:01.756 --> 34:04.390
Then nice and slow,

34:04.392 --> 34:06.259
then rough again.

34:06.261 --> 34:09.161
Who's the lucky guy?

34:09.164 --> 34:11.097
Cone of silence.

34:11.099 --> 34:12.431
Okay.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.280
Shit.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.518
<i>Phoenix FBI.</i>

34:32.521 --> 34:36.589
Hi, I have information
about an Ezra Bloom.

35:05.767 --> 35:07.767
<i>Thank you for holding.
How may I direct your call?</i>

35:07.769 --> 35:09.102
I have some information

35:09.104 --> 35:11.537
about one of your cases, Ezra Bloom.

35:11.539 --> 35:13.439
Was just hoping to parlay with
someone about the specifics.

35:13.441 --> 35:15.208
<i>Please hold.</i>

35:15.210 --> 35:16.743
<i>Due to high call volume,
your waiting time</i>

35:16.745 --> 35:19.012
<i>will be approximately ten minutes.</i>

35:19.014 --> 35:20.713
<i>- Thank you for calling the FBI.</i>
- Crap.

35:20.715 --> 35:22.749
Let's be professional, please.

35:22.751 --> 35:24.250
Aye, aye, coach.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.351
Heads up.

35:27.222 --> 35:29.689
So, look, if there's any trouble...

35:29.691 --> 35:31.090
There won't be any trouble.

35:32.527 --> 35:33.693
Oh, my God, what?

35:33.695 --> 35:35.395
- Are you crazy?
- Relax.

35:35.397 --> 35:36.396
I gave it to my mom for Christmas.

35:36.398 --> 35:37.697
It's never been loaded.

35:37.699 --> 35:38.798
That's a terrible Christmas present.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.933
Guns in the home kill more...

35:40.935 --> 35:42.802
Just promise me you won't pull it out.

35:42.804 --> 35:45.004
All options are on the table.

35:45.006 --> 35:46.372
What?

35:49.811 --> 35:51.411
Don't answer that, man. Don't answer it!

35:51.413 --> 35:52.679
It might be someone important.

35:52.681 --> 35:54.547
- Hello?
<i>- Richie, listen.</i>

35:54.549 --> 35:56.282
I have to tell you
something about your friend.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.917
Oh, hey, super fun night.

35:57.919 --> 35:59.619
Can't talk.

35:59.621 --> 36:01.587
Shit.

36:01.589 --> 36:03.589
<i>Seven minutes.</i>

36:03.591 --> 36:06.125
<i>- Thank you for calling the FBI.</i>
- 3-2-3 to base.

36:06.127 --> 36:07.760
<i>Go for dispatch.</i>

36:07.762 --> 36:10.263
Listen, Debbie, I need a quick GPS trace

36:10.265 --> 36:12.832
from my cell to the last call I made.

36:18.707 --> 36:20.940
So here we are.

36:20.942 --> 36:22.608
Where's the ring?

36:22.610 --> 36:25.511
Where's the cash?

36:25.513 --> 36:27.180
500 large.

36:27.182 --> 36:29.282
Show me the ring.

36:29.284 --> 36:31.417
Show me the cash.

36:36.091 --> 36:38.124
Your turn.

36:38.126 --> 36:39.459
Dump it out.

36:39.461 --> 36:41.060
You sure?

36:41.062 --> 36:42.428
I'm sure.

36:47.769 --> 36:48.935
Aha!

36:48.937 --> 36:50.203
I've seen this trick before!

36:50.205 --> 36:51.471
You seen this trick?

36:51.473 --> 36:53.139
- Whoa!
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:53.205 --> 36:54.674
Fluke, take the ring off him.

36:54.676 --> 36:56.209
- What?
- Fluke!

36:56.211 --> 36:57.443
Yeah.

36:57.445 --> 36:59.278
Okay, okay, it's cool, man.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.147
I'm really sorry about this, man.

37:01.149 --> 37:02.348
No, we're cool, bro, we're cool.

37:02.350 --> 37:03.649
That dude with the magnifying glass

37:03.651 --> 37:05.351
wasn't even a real appraiser, was he?

37:05.353 --> 37:07.420
You don't even know what you don't know.

37:07.422 --> 37:09.122
You're a joke, Evans.

37:09.124 --> 37:10.957
The whole town knows it.

37:10.959 --> 37:12.625
Don't listen to him.

37:12.627 --> 37:13.960
You're the man.

37:13.962 --> 37:15.461
I'm your backup.

37:15.463 --> 37:17.130
Don't, bro. Don't.

37:17.132 --> 37:19.165
Run!

37:26.775 --> 37:28.474
Give me the ring.

37:28.476 --> 37:30.209
- Give him the ring, Richard.
- Give him the ring!

37:30.211 --> 37:31.511
- Calm down, all right?
- Give me the goddamn ring!

37:31.513 --> 37:32.545
Just calm down.

37:32.547 --> 37:33.813
Oh, shit.

37:33.815 --> 37:35.581
We got to go, son.

37:37.585 --> 37:39.585
Oh, shit!

37:39.587 --> 37:41.020
Shit, shit, shit!

37:41.022 --> 37:42.722
Shit, shit!

37:46.594 --> 37:48.127
Oh, my God, Kim.

37:48.129 --> 37:49.562
- I owe you so bad.
- No kidding.

37:49.564 --> 37:51.030
Ezra Bloom, you're under arrest.

37:51.032 --> 37:52.031
Whoa, whoa, Kim, what are you doing?

37:52.033 --> 37:53.366
Richie, get away.

37:53.368 --> 37:54.734
Your campaign guy is wanted by the FBI.

37:54.736 --> 37:56.803
- He's a criminal.
- I am not a criminal!

37:56.805 --> 37:58.004
And I don't know about her either.

37:58.006 --> 37:59.605
- Me?
- Kim, I don't know what

37:59.607 --> 38:01.207
you heard,
but it's not what it looks like, okay?

38:01.209 --> 38:02.608
Frankly, Richard, I have no idea

38:02.610 --> 38:04.744
what this looks like,
but I'm saving you.

38:04.746 --> 38:06.078
- Move.
- No, no, no, no.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.213
No, no, listen to me, Kim.

38:07.215 --> 38:08.548
You got to let them go, okay?

38:08.550 --> 38:10.183
I'm the one who screwed up.

38:10.185 --> 38:11.584
Okay, fine,
then we'll all go to the station

38:11.586 --> 38:13.853
and wait for the FBI together.

38:13.855 --> 38:16.622
Always forward.

38:16.624 --> 38:18.224
Okay. Everybody be ...ing cool!

38:18.226 --> 38:19.559
Drop the gun!

38:19.561 --> 38:21.227
Put the gun on the ground now!

38:21.229 --> 38:22.295
- Drop the gun!
- Now! Do it now, before I blow

38:22.297 --> 38:24.063
his pretty little head off!

38:24.065 --> 38:26.899
- Okay, take it easy, Jules.
- Drop it, Kim. Drop it.

38:26.901 --> 38:29.702
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- This is a very bad idea.

38:29.704 --> 38:31.537
Okay, be cool, Kim.
We're walking, we're walking.

38:31.539 --> 38:32.538
The money, Mr. Bloom?

38:36.644 --> 38:38.778
Do not approach the vehicle.

38:40.248 --> 38:42.849
Do not get in the vehicle.

38:45.887 --> 38:47.520
I'm actually really sorry about this.

38:47.522 --> 38:48.988
Richie, drive.

38:48.990 --> 38:52.425
Richie, do not put it in gear!

38:57.298 --> 38:58.731
Mother ...er!

38:58.733 --> 38:59.932
<i>Connecting you now.</i>

38:59.934 --> 39:02.134
<i>FBI Special Agent Mangrove.</i>

39:02.136 --> 39:03.970
<i>So, you found Ezra Bloom, did you?</i>

39:10.781 --> 39:13.616
_

39:27.232 --> 39:29.265
Yo, Simons, you got a stapler?

39:36.401 --> 39:38.435
Gets you every time, Simons.

39:52.551 --> 39:54.150
We found the missing cruiser.

39:54.152 --> 39:56.653
Suspects have fled, most likely armed.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.421
- Use caution.
- We're all clear.

40:03.695 --> 40:05.295
<i>Urgent care. This is Britney.</i>

40:05.297 --> 40:07.063
Yes, I'd like to make an appointment

40:07.065 --> 40:10.099
- for a... bum knee.
<i>- When can you come in?</i>

40:10.101 --> 40:13.203
I can come in at his
earliest convenience.

40:20.912 --> 40:24.647
"My town, my people.
I totally got this."

40:24.649 --> 40:26.783
We'll be safe from the FBI in Mexico.

40:26.785 --> 40:28.184
Then we sell the ring

40:28.186 --> 40:29.519
and figure out how to fix this.

40:29.521 --> 40:30.854
Yeah, we're gonna have a hard time

40:30.856 --> 40:32.388
fencing the ring in Mexico.

40:32.390 --> 40:33.690
Yeah, I'll find someone.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.758
A real professional.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.327
Straight-up,

40:37.329 --> 40:38.661
I don't have the ring.

40:38.663 --> 40:40.096
- What?
- Luke took it off you?

40:40.098 --> 40:41.931
No, it was never on me. I hid it.

40:41.933 --> 40:43.933
The smart play was to
take Luke to the ring

40:43.935 --> 40:45.768
after making sure all
the cash was there.

40:45.770 --> 40:47.670
We're fleeing to Mexico
without the ring?

40:47.672 --> 40:49.706
Where did you hide the ring?

40:49.708 --> 40:51.374
Um...

40:51.376 --> 40:52.909
<i>You're not gonna like it.</i>

41:15.901 --> 41:17.967
Hi! Molly Jackson?

41:17.969 --> 41:19.068
Uh, yeah.

41:19.070 --> 41:22.305
Or should I say Ava Bloom,
Alice Evans, Cece Langmore?

41:22.307 --> 41:23.573
Or is it just

41:23.575 --> 41:25.975
Maddie Jonson, no H in "Jonson"?

41:31.149 --> 41:32.949
I'm Shelly.

41:32.951 --> 41:34.250
Shelly Cohen. I'm...

41:34.252 --> 41:36.853
fairly confident you know my ex-wife.

41:36.855 --> 41:39.422
You're Lenny Cohen's husband?

41:39.424 --> 41:41.190
- Ex-husband.
- Ex-husband.

41:41.192 --> 41:43.493
Bingo!

41:43.495 --> 41:45.828
Ooh!

41:45.830 --> 41:47.864
Oh, come on, Maddie.

41:47.866 --> 41:49.432
Aren't you gonna invite me in?
