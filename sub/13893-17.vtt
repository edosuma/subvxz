WEBVTT

00:12.090 --> 00:14.350
Dude, what are we going to do this weekend?

00:14.350 --> 00:16.050
Nothing's going on.

00:16.219 --> 00:17.100
I don't know.

00:17.340 --> 00:18.810
Dude, it's Benson!

00:23.730 --> 00:26.800
Alright, so that's tonight. Don't forget it.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.870
- We'll be there. - See you there.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.870
- What was that all about? - I don't know.

00:32.930 --> 00:37.720
Oh, Mordecai and Rigby. What costumes are you going to wear?

00:38.110 --> 00:39.190
Costumes?

00:39.190 --> 00:42.370
Muscle Man's throwing a birthday party for Hi Five Ghost.

00:42.420 --> 00:45.020
Apparently it's a costume birthday party.

00:45.020 --> 00:45.820
Let me see.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.590
Ah, what? It's invite only.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.960
You guys got invited, right?

00:49.970 --> 00:51.770
We didn't even know there was a party.

00:51.770 --> 00:54.700
- Did you know there was a party? - No, I did not.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.540
We didn't even know there was a party.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.140
Oh, well...

00:58.920 --> 01:00.780
Maybe you weren't invited.

01:04.300 --> 01:07.150
Hey, Muscle Man. We heard that you're having a party tonight.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.310
What time should we show up?

01:08.600 --> 01:10.660
NEVER, YOU'RE NOT INVITED!

01:16.740 --> 01:18.130
Dude! What's his problem?

01:18.130 --> 01:19.710
Why won't he invite us to his party?

01:19.710 --> 01:21.900
Dude. I know why he's not inviting us to the party.

01:21.950 --> 01:22.470
Why?

01:22.470 --> 01:24.390
Remember when you were choking this morning.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.910
Look at Rigby's face!

01:30.910 --> 01:33.860
Oh no, he's choking! Don't worry, dude. I gotcha!

01:36.350 --> 01:41.780
Aw, sick! Your chokewad spat soda in my face!

01:43.970 --> 01:46.550
Dude, that wasn't our fault, I was gonna die!

01:46.660 --> 01:48.500
And besides, we got him a new soda.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.740
Ugh, quit whining!

01:52.740 --> 01:54.580
Here's another soda, ya big baby!

02:04.210 --> 02:07.080
Yep, that's probably why he's not inviting us to his party.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.680
We gotta go apologize.

02:11.490 --> 02:12.190
What?

02:12.380 --> 02:14.860
Hey, Muscle Man. We're sorry about that soda thing this morning,

02:14.860 --> 02:16.900
so we bought our console as a peace offering.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.410
You can borrow it for your party.

02:18.410 --> 02:21.910
One, I don't know what you're talking about and B, I'm busy.

02:22.380 --> 02:24.370
But I'll still take your video game.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.450
Yo Hi Five Ghost! I found a video game system on the ground.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.660
Let's see what happens when we put it in the microwave.

02:33.660 --> 02:35.880
Dude, you said that was gonna work.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.200
I know, I know.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.130
He'd better not trash our system. That thing wasn't cheap!

02:40.290 --> 02:41.320
Come on!

02:41.320 --> 02:43.990
Ugh! Man, he's not gonna invite us.

02:43.990 --> 02:46.440
We already said sorry. What else can we do?

02:46.520 --> 02:48.090
Oh, I know what to do.

02:48.090 --> 02:48.620
What?

02:48.680 --> 02:51.510
We just have to make Muscle Man think that we don't wanna go to his party.

02:51.550 --> 02:53.670
- What? - Reverse psychology.

02:53.670 --> 02:56.800
If he thinks we're not into it, then he'll really want us to be there.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.330
Nice.

02:59.330 --> 03:02.620
Just act like the party's lame and watch the invitations come rolling in.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.500
Muscle Man, we don't wanna go to your party.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.010
Good, because I wasn't gonna invite you anyway,

03:11.010 --> 03:12.490
so get lost!

03:13.230 --> 03:14.410
Muscle Man,

03:14.450 --> 03:15.980
we're sorry about the soda!

03:16.080 --> 03:20.640
What are you talking about? I said GET LOST!

03:21.340 --> 03:22.380
Forget it!

03:26.770 --> 03:28.210
Wanna play some video games?

03:28.210 --> 03:30.640
We gave away our system, remember?

03:30.970 --> 03:33.390
Well, whatever. The party's gonna be lame, anyway.

03:33.390 --> 03:36.460
It's just gonna Pops, Skips, and Benson sitting around doin' nothing.

03:43.710 --> 03:46.870
Dude, forget the invitation. Let's just crash it.

03:46.870 --> 03:47.740
Yeah.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.490
Dude, this is amazing.

03:58.490 --> 04:00.950
Hold up! You're not on the list.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.210
What? How do you know we're not on the list?

04:03.210 --> 04:03.990
Name?

04:03.990 --> 04:05.570
Mordecai and Rigby.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.810
Not on the list!

04:06.810 --> 04:06.820
I can only let people in that's on the list.
Not on the list!

04:06.820 --> 04:09.160
I can only let people in that's on the list.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.210
Yo, hold up! You're not on the list!

04:12.210 --> 04:15.400
Ey, yo, Bobby! You can let that guy in.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.850
He seems legit.

04:18.019 --> 04:20.640
Let's keep this party goin'!

04:20.750 --> 04:22.160
Right this way, sir.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.560
Aw, what? He didn't even have a costume.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.990
Yeah, what the H, Bobby?

04:26.790 --> 04:28.100
Dude, let's go.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.310
Wait, where you goin'?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.740
We're gonna get into this lame party.

04:33.350 --> 04:34.420
Dude, come on.

04:34.610 --> 04:35.990
We'll just go through the window.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.230
oo! Par-tay!

04:40.540 --> 04:41.570
Hey, it's fives!

04:41.710 --> 04:43.830
- Happy birthday, fives! - Whut?

04:43.830 --> 04:46.140
Woah, sorry. We thought you were someone else.

04:47.380 --> 04:51.810
Dude, I'm not Hi Five Ghost! I'm his brother, Lo-Five Ghost.

04:51.810 --> 04:53.100
What're you guys doing out here?

04:53.100 --> 04:54.550
The party's inside!

04:56.280 --> 04:59.730
Haha, yeah... we... weren't really invited.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.840
What?! Why not?

05:01.840 --> 05:02.900
That's what we wanna know.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.570
We don't really care - we just wanna get in.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.510
OK, look. I'm not supposed to say this but,

05:07.510 --> 05:09.160
if you really wanna get into the party,

05:09.160 --> 05:11.030
I can turn you into a ghost.

05:11.030 --> 05:11.620
Really?

05:11.630 --> 05:14.290
Yeah, then you won't have to go through the door!

05:14.290 --> 05:16.260
You can go through the wall.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.730
Plus, your costumes will be a lot more believable.

05:18.730 --> 05:20.390
So, what do you say? You guys wanna do it?

05:20.390 --> 05:21.650
- Let's do it! - OK, yeah!

05:22.640 --> 05:25.970
Alright! Up high! Down low!

05:27.830 --> 05:29.490
Now you're ghosts.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.160
Aw, man! THis is so cool!

05:34.160 --> 05:36.010
Dude, dude, punch me in the face!

05:36.040 --> 05:36.910
OK!

05:40.550 --> 05:42.590
I thought stuff's supposed to go through us.

05:42.590 --> 05:44.760
Well, yeah, real stuff if you want,

05:44.770 --> 05:46.310
but not other ghosts.

05:46.310 --> 05:48.000
Party!

05:49.890 --> 05:52.650
Mordecai and Rigby, hello!

05:52.690 --> 05:54.340
Hey, happy birthday!

05:54.340 --> 05:55.620
Yeah, happy birthday!

05:55.620 --> 05:56.600
Thanks!

05:56.750 --> 05:59.090
So, you guys got invited after all?

06:00.020 --> 06:01.610
You could say that.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.210
What wonderful costumes!

06:05.330 --> 06:07.130
These aren't costumes.

06:07.130 --> 06:09.340
Wait, those aren't costumes?

06:09.340 --> 06:12.280
Yeah, no, we're totally ghosts!

06:12.280 --> 06:13.890
Yeah, your brother turned us into ghosts

06:13.890 --> 06:15.720
so we could sneak in here and wish you a happy birthday.

06:15.820 --> 06:18.070
Oh no. This is bad.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.530
Yeah, we're bad! We do whatever it takes to party!

06:21.830 --> 06:23.940
No - you've got bigger problems.

06:23.970 --> 06:26.130
If you don't get turned back into yourselves soon,

06:26.130 --> 06:28.050
you'll be stuck as ghosts forever!

06:28.100 --> 06:30.220
What?! Well change us back!

06:30.220 --> 06:32.290
I can't! I don't know how!

06:33.060 --> 06:35.040
Dude! You turned them into ghosts?!

06:35.040 --> 06:36.150
Change them back!

06:36.150 --> 06:37.800
I don't know how to!

06:37.990 --> 06:39.900
But... maybe dad knows!

06:41.320 --> 06:44.200
Not good. Not good at all.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.200
If you want to turn back into yourselves,

06:46.200 --> 06:48.090
you have to scare someone.

06:48.310 --> 06:49.510
Scare someone?

06:49.510 --> 06:52.040
Yes. It's the only way.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.170
Dude, let's scare Muscle Man.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.490
He doesn't know we're here yet so he won't be expecting it.

06:56.490 --> 06:57.550
OK, let's do it!

06:57.820 --> 07:00.760
Oh, man! I gotta use it!

07:03.150 --> 07:05.180
He's going to the bathroom. Quick, hide!

07:14.600 --> 07:15.600
What's he doing?!

07:15.600 --> 07:17.320
Oh no. He's having a heart attack!

07:18.240 --> 07:19.580
We need a doctor!

07:21.230 --> 07:23.060
Everyone back up, back up!

07:23.060 --> 07:23.950
What happened?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.070
We scared him... and he fell over!

07:26.380 --> 07:29.120
OK, step back, let him breath.

07:30.830 --> 07:32.120
He's not breathing!

07:37.270 --> 07:38.700
...he's gone.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.990
You killed my best friend!

07:45.990 --> 07:48.340
- We're sorry! - Yeah, we didn't mean it!

07:48.340 --> 07:50.270
We just wanted to get into the party.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.470
Got you, dudes!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.580
Best! Prank! Ever!

08:05.880 --> 08:08.180
What?! What's wrong with you?!

08:08.380 --> 08:09.710
This was a prank?!

08:09.710 --> 08:13.760
Yeah, it was! And you two fell for it!

08:13.760 --> 08:16.920
Wait. I thought you invited us to a costume party.

08:17.170 --> 08:17.970
I did.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.770
But that was just the beginning of my plan.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.440
When you jerks spilled soda in my face,

08:23.440 --> 08:25.690
I knew I had to get you back.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.290
That's when I decided to throw a party.

08:28.570 --> 08:32.860
I invited people and I made sure that you were aware of that.

08:33.130 --> 08:35.690
Then we bailed Fives' brother out of jail

08:35.880 --> 08:38.059
so he could turn you into ghosts.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.450
It was the ultimate prank.

08:40.450 --> 08:42.900
The ultimate payback.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.560
Wait... but if you wanted to prank us at the party,

08:45.560 --> 08:47.040
how come you didn't invite us?

08:47.040 --> 08:47.860
Easy,

08:48.010 --> 08:51.740
not inviting you was the only way I knew you'd show.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.120
It's called reverse psy-cho-logy, babies!

08:57.380 --> 09:00.170
This is the lamest and most expensive prank ever.

09:01.930 --> 09:03.600
And it was worth it.

09:03.700 --> 09:08.570
Maybe next time you'll think twice before spilling soda in my face.

09:08.570 --> 09:10.550
Yeah, we'll definitely think twice.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.950
Alright, I'm out of here.

09:13.790 --> 09:17.460
Where you guys goin'? Thee's still plenty of food!

09:22.630 --> 09:24.190
Oh, dude, Muscle Man's choking!

09:24.190 --> 09:26.190
You have to help him! You're a doctor!

09:26.300 --> 09:28.490
No, I'm not a doctor!

09:28.490 --> 09:31.330
That was just part of the prank! Does anyone know the Heimlich?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.210
Mordecai knows it!

09:34.210 --> 09:35.990
Yeah right, he's just faking it.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.920
As soon as I help him hes' going to be all.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.540
Got you again, dudes!

09:39.540 --> 09:40.510
I'm sick of it.

09:40.590 --> 09:42.600
Ah, lame. Dude, are you pranking us?

09:45.590 --> 09:47.380
Dude, he's not pranking us!

09:47.780 --> 09:49.450
I got you Muscle Man, I got ya!

09:54.490 --> 09:56.410
I hope this makes us even.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.460
It does.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.510
Lo-Fives, change 'em back.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.090
I'm sorry I pranked you guys so hard.

10:03.090 --> 10:05.780
Look. It's gonna be a real party,

10:05.780 --> 10:08.080
and you guys can stay if you want to.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.970
So, seriously. Is this a real party or not?

10:15.030 --> 10:17.750
Does this answer your question?

10:20.780 --> 10:23.360
No. Doesn't really answer my question.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.740
I thought I could get it in the tape deck.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.870
Here. Does this answer your question?

10:29.050 --> 10:31.350
Everybody party!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.220
Can you believe this?

10:35.310 --> 10:36.050
No.

10:36.170 --> 10:38.160
Hey, next time you see Muscle Man with a soda,

10:38.160 --> 10:40.290
can you remind me not' to spill it in his face?

10:40.430 --> 10:42.510
Yes. Yes I can.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.850
Hey guys. I thought you'd like to have this back.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.010
Aw, thanks!

10:47.070 --> 10:49.260
Hey, wait. Is this just paper mache?

10:49.320 --> 10:50.890
Yeah, sorry guys.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.700
I sold the real one to a pawn shop. It was all a part of the prank.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.380
Are you serious?!

10:56.380 --> 10:57.920
What's wrong with you?!

10:58.620 --> 11:00.300
Got you, dudes!
