21:19.861 --> 21:21.989
YOU WERE IN DEEP COVER?

21:22.072 --> 21:23.573
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?

21:23.657 --> 21:24.992
- HA!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.326
- I DID THINK OF THAT.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.415
- [mutters]

21:31.498 --> 21:34.001
- [gasps]
YOU'RE NOT THE CHIEF.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.963
YOU'RE HIS EVIL TWIN BROTHER
WITH A MUSTACHE.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.967
BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T EXPECT IS...

21:42.050 --> 21:45.429
THIS GERIATRIC REIGN OF TERROR
IS OVER, BOYS.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.847
[siren wails]

21:46.930 --> 21:48.557
[phone rings]

21:48.640 --> 21:50.726
- GOOD WORK, KID.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.728
YOU'VE DONE THAT BADGE PROUD.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.731
- THANKS, CHIEF,
BUT I CAN'T TAKE THIS BADGE.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.566
EVEN THOUGH I DID
SINGLE-HANDEDLY COLLAR

21:57.649 --> 21:59.901
THOSE OLD CRIMINALS
TO SAVE EVERYONE,

21:59.985 --> 22:01.903
MY RIDE ALONG WAS A SHAM,
SO, TECHNICALLY,

22:01.987 --> 22:04.364
I DIDN'T REALLY EARN IT.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.574
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

22:05.657 --> 22:07.909
FOR BUSTING UP
THAT GERIATRIC CRIME RING,

22:07.993 --> 22:10.328
I THINK YOU'VE MORE
THAN EARNED IT.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.663
- WELL, WHO AM I
TO QUESTION THE CHIEF?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.498
THANKS.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.751
- HEY!

22:15.834 --> 22:17.252
FIRST, YOU GOT TO FILL OUT
THE REPORT

22:17.336 --> 22:17.836
FOR THAT ARREST, JUNIOR.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.880
- REPORT?

22:23.884 --> 22:24.509
YAY!
PAPERWORK!
